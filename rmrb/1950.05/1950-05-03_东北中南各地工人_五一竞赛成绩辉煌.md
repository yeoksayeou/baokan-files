Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st: Many state-owned factories in Northeast China held production competitions before May Day and have now achieved preliminary results.

The caustic soda workshop of the Cao Da Factory in the Dalian-Lushun area completed the second quarter's production task at 10:00 AM on the 18th ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by 1.7 percent, and the quality also improved by 3 percent. The Dalian Glass Factory, striving to complete 50 percent of its annual production task before May Day, had also completed 47.52 percent of its annual production task by 5:00 PM on the 20th of this month. Workers at the Dalian Cement Factory repaired equipment and broke through the existing production level (the factory has exceeded its pre-liberation production level), producing 18,000 tons of cement in April.

The Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 6, with the active efforts of all its employees, completed its April production task entirely in just fourteen days, exceeding it by 9 percent. The oxygen and grease workshops of the Shenyang Chemical Factory also completed their April production tasks ten days ahead of schedule in the upsurge of competition to welcome May Day.

Workers in An Dong City, Liaodong Province, displayed unprecedented labor enthusiasm to welcome their holiday, and all seventeen state-owned and public-owned factories in the city also completed their April production tasks ahead of schedule. The state-owned An Dong Paper Mill, on the basis of successfully exceeding the first quarter's production task by 15.5 percent, completed its April production task four days and ten hours ahead of schedule. The provincial-owned Dan Hua Match Factory completed its April task twenty-five hours ahead of schedule after completing its first quarter task ahead of schedule.

Most public-owned factories in Jilin City, Jilin Province, have completed and exceeded their April production tasks ahead of schedule. Since the end of March, the city's public-owned factories have launched a campaign to welcome May Day by completing the April production plan ahead of schedule. By April 26th, the state-owned Factory 41 had completed the entire month's waterwheel production task, exceeding the task by 8.5 percent, and the quality also met standard specifications. The Jilin Rubber Factory, Alcohol Factory, Flax Factory, Machinery Factory, and Huadian Oil Shale Mine have all completed or exceeded their production tasks.

As of now, six factories in Mudanjiang City, Songjiang Province, have realized the slogan of completing the April production task.

The Weichanggou Coal Mine in Rehe Province completed its April production task ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 1st: Some factories and mines in the Central South region have completed their production plans ahead of schedule to welcome May Day. The Wuhan Military Supply Clothing Factory has completed more than double its April production task after continuously adjusting its labor force. Under the slogan of "Overcoming Floods and Welcoming May Day," all workers at the Jiang'an Bridge Factory of the Beijing-Hankou Railway completed the early April plan six days ahead of schedule. They then accepted new tasks of manufacturing one bay of new five-meter steel beams and converting one bay of eleven-meter upper-bearing steel beams, completing them forty and twenty-two days ahead of schedule respectively, and saving three hundred man-days. The factory's bridge team braved the rain to rush to repair the permanent project of the Sanda Bridge at 240 meters on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, ensuring traffic on May Day and saving labor equivalent to 50,000 catties of rice. The Hubei Provincial Agricultural Reclamation Office's April production exceeded the original plan by 120 percent, with a surplus of 7,755 work-points. The resolution proposed by the office at the end of March to welcome May Day, "Break through difficulties and strive for self-sufficiency," has now been realized. Workers in the forging workshop have also created a method of using fixed models to replace manual manufacturing of screws, increasing productivity twelvefold. The two-month project of digging a new mine shaft and repairing the wind lane by the private Yuanhua Coal Mine Company in Daye was also completed in twenty-five days this month. In addition to completing the tasks stipulated by the Railway Bureau for April eleven days ahead of schedule, the Jiang'an Inspection Section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, led by members of the Youth League, completed the revival, partial repair, and transformation of seventeen freight cars, and also self-made four sets of Class A inspection tools and one screw cap bed. The Jiang'an Railway Factory's April production also exceeded the task by 150 percent; other large and small units affiliated to the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau completed their production plans to welcome May Day around April 20th. In addition to completing the production tasks, most workers at the Daye Central China Iron and Steel Company enthusiastically participated in the company's asset inventory work, searching for waste materials and reviving the "May 1st" and "Labor" locomotives. Four units in Wuhan, including the Public Transportation Management Office, also used their spare time in late April to repair four scrapped cars, naming them "May 1st Labor." The new Da Jing shock test excavation project of the Jiangxi State-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine began in April, with the average daily progress rate increasing tenfold compared to before liberation.
