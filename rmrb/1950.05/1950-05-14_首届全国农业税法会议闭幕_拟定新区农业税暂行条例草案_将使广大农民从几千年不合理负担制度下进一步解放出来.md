(Xinhua News Agency, 13th) The draft of the unified "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" has been formulated by the first National Agricultural Tax Law Conference. The conference opened on April 19th and closed on May 3rd. In addition to the draft "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas," the conference also drafted three other documents: instructions on the implementation of these provisional regulations, provisions on the standards for determining land area and yield in these regulations, and measures for the advance requisition of summer public grain in newly liberated areas in 1950. All drafts will be submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and then promulgated for implementation.

The conference believes that the Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas are a major matter concerning the lives and production of 300 million people. During the autumn grain collection in newly liberated areas last year, some regions experienced quite serious chaotic phenomena of being excessively heavy or light. This shows that it is extremely necessary to formulate unified provisional regulations on agricultural tax in newly liberated areas. The formulation and implementation of unified provisional agricultural tax regulations will further liberate the vast number of farmers in newly liberated areas from thousands of years of unreasonable burdens.

Therefore, the conference discussed in detail the various issues within the draft provisional regulations, with particular emphasis on tax rates, the scope of burden, and the burden on tenanted land. On tax rates, a progressive tax system was stipulated to adapt to the different affordability of various strata in the newly liberated areas. On the scope of the burden, the population bearing the burden will be expanded to account for 90 percent of the agricultural population. On the burden of tenanted land, it is stipulated that: for those who have legally reduced rent and paid rent, the landlord and tenant will share the burden; for those who have not reduced rent or have pre-collected rent, the landlord will bear the entire burden; if the landlord does not collect rent, the tenant will bear the entire burden. The Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas first emphasize unification. On the other hand, in order to take care of the specific circumstances of each region, a certain range of flexibility is allowed to suit local conditions.

During the conference, representatives from various regions had heated debates on various issues in the draft, based on the different situations, experiences, and practices of their respective regions. At the same time, the content of the draft was repeatedly discussed and revised by the general assembly group no less than six or seven times. Subsequently, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Shao Lizi, Huang Shaohong, and Chen Shaoxian were invited to a forum to gather ideas. The draft was also sent to various regions to widely solicit opinions, and then submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee for review before being submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and promulgation.

### 首届全国农业税法会议闭幕　拟定新区农业税暂行条例草案　将使广大农民从几千年不合理负担制度下进一步解放出来

　　首届全国农业税法会议闭幕
　　拟定新区农业税暂行条例草案
　　将使广大农民从几千年不合理负担制度下进一步解放出来
    【新华社十三日讯】统一的新解放区农业税暂行条例草案已由首届全国农业税法会议拟定。会议于上月十九日开幕，本月三日闭幕。除“新解放区农业税暂行条例”草案外，会议还草拟了关于实施这一农业税暂行条例的指示、这一农业税暂行条例中关于土地面积及产量订定标准的规定以及一九五○年新解放区夏季公粮借征办法等三个草案；各项草案于呈请政务院批准后，即予公布施行。
    会议认为：新区农业税暂行条例是关系到三万万人口的生活与生产的大事。去年新解放区各地秋征中某些地区曾发生相当严重的畸重畸轻的紊乱现象。这说明了制定新区统一的农业税暂行条例是极其必要的。而统一农业税暂行条例的制订和实施将使广大新解放区农民从几千年不合理负担制度下进一步解放出来。
    因此，会议详细地讨论了新区农业税暂行条例草案内的各项问题，特别着重讨论了税率、负担面及租佃地负担三个问题。在税率上，为了适应新区各阶层不同的负担能力，规定了累进税制；在负担面上，今后负担人口将扩大为占农业人口百分之九十；在租佃地负担上，规定：依法减租缴租者，由业主与佃户分担；尚未减租或已预收租者，由业主全部负担；业主不收租者，由佃户全部负担。新区农业税暂行条例首先强调了统一，另方面，为了照顾各地区特殊情况，也在一定范围内允许因地制宜。
    会议期间，对于草案上各项问题，各地区代表根据各该地区情况，经验与惯例不同，曾展开热烈争论。同时草案内容经大会小组反复讨论，修改不下六七次之多，后复邀请黄炎培、陈叔通、邵力子、黄绍竑、陈劭先等座谈，以集思广益；并将草案发给各地区，广泛吸收意见，然后再呈请财经委员会审查后转呈政务院批准公布。
