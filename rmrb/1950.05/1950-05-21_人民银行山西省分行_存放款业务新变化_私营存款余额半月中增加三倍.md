People's Bank of China, Shanxi Branch
    New Changes in Deposit and Loan Business
    Private Deposit Balance Increases Threefold in Half a Month
    [Reported by this newspaper] Due to stable prices, increased confidence in the local currency, and the specific implementation of work tasks by the business department of the People's Bank of China, Shanxi Branch, there have been new changes in deposit and transfer business recently. The first is an increase in deposit balances. In the past, the total amount of deposits withdrawn was often greater than the total amount deposited during the same period, resulting in a relative decrease in the total deposit balance at the end of the month. For example, at the end of March, the total amount deposited was 133.6 billion, while the total amount withdrawn was 135.9 billion, leaving an end-of-month balance of only 21.4 billion. In early April, the total amount deposited was 31.7 billion, while the total amount withdrawn during the same period was only 24.3 billion, resulting in an end-of-ten-day-period balance of 28.8 billion, a relative increase compared to the past. Private deposits have increased dramatically threefold. At the end of March, the bank's private deposit balance was only 150 million, but by April 15th, statistics showed it had reached more than 600 million. This is mainly because the "emphasizing real goods over currency" mentality of general industrialists and merchants has changed after price stabilization, and the government has adopted appropriate controls on deposit and loan interest rates for private firms. Secondly, the loan balance has decreased. Statistics at the end of March showed that the bank had loaned out 12 billion, recovered only 10.7 billion, leaving a balance of 6.8 billion. However, in early April, loans issued were only 220 million, while repayments reached 1.21 billion, leaving a balance of 5.81 billion, a relative decrease. In terms of transfer and remittance work, statistics for early April showed that among the total amount remitted out, 5,154,680 was transferred from deposits, accounting for 64% of the remittances; and among the total amount remitted in, 17,475,200 was transferred to deposits, accounting for 63% of the total amount remitted in. Based on deposits absorbed in this ten-day period, this accounts for approximately 55% of total deposits. Thus, due to the strengthening of transfer and remittance business, unnecessary cash receipts and payments have been greatly reduced. At the same time, due to the changes in the above-mentioned businesses, not only has market idle funds been reduced, but also the stability of prices and finance has been promoted.

　　人民银行山西省分行
    存放款业务新变化           
    私营存款余额半月中增加三倍
    【本报讯】人民银行山西省分行营业部存放转拨业务，由于物价稳定，本币信用日高，以及该部对工作任务的具体贯彻，最近有了新的变化。首先是存款余额增加。以往存款的提取总额，常是大于同时期的存入总额，因而月终的存款总余额也就相对减少，如三月月终存入总额为一、三三六亿，提取总额即有一、三五九亿，月终余额仅有二一四亿。四月上旬，存入总额为三一七亿，而同一时期的提取总额则只有二四三亿，旬终余额还有二八八亿，比之过去余额相对增加。私营存款激增三倍。三月月终，该行私营存款余额仅一亿五千万元，到四月十五日统计已达六亿之多。主要是因为一般工商业者在物价稳定后“重实物轻货币”的心理已有了改变，及政府对私营行庄存放款利率采取了适当管制的结果。其次是放款余额减少。三月月终统计，该行放款一二○亿，收回仅一○七亿，余额即达六八亿元。但四月上旬，放款仅二亿二千万元，收回即达十二亿一千万元，余额为五十八亿一千万元，显得相对减少。在转账汇拨工作上，四月上旬统计，汇出总额中，以存款转拨者为五一五、四六八万，即占汇出的百分之六四；汇入总额中转拨为存款的为一、七四七、五二○万元，占汇入总额的百分之六三。以本旬吸收存款论，约占整个存款的百分之五五。这样，由于转账汇拨业务的加强，就大大减少了不必要的现金收付。同时，由于上述各种业务的变化，不惟减少了市场游资，更促进了物价与金融的稳定。
