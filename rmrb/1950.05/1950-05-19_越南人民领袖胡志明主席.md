　　The Vietnamese People's Leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh
    May 19th is the sixtieth birthday of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the founder of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On this day, all patriotic people in Vietnam will joyfully celebrate the health and longevity of their beloved leader.
    Chairman Ho Chi Minh has dedicated himself to the liberation cause of the Vietnamese people for more than forty years. He was born in 1890 in a peasant family in Nghe An, central Vietnam. In his youth, he was influenced by the anti-French movement at the time and actively participated in the Vietnamese national revolution. During the Versailles Peace Conference after World War I, he was in France and submitted a memorandum to the Allied delegation outlining eight demands for Vietnamese independence. Although the imperialists ignored this demand, the widespread distribution of this document in Paris and Vietnam greatly inspired the Vietnamese people.
    During his stay in Paris, Ho Chi Minh organized a "Colonial Union" and published the "Paris Weekly," exposing the crimes of French colonial rule and advocating for the independence and liberation of colonial peoples. Later, he joined the French Socialist Party. When the Socialist Party split into the Second International and the Third International factions, he voted in favor of the Third International faction led by Cachin and others at the party congress.
    In 1924, Ho Chi Minh left France for the Soviet Union. He was deeply moved by the Soviet social system and the lives of the people, and he also learned a great deal of revolutionary theory and experience. Soon, he returned to Vietnam via Guangzhou, China. At that time, Guangzhou was the center of the Chinese Great Revolution. He participated in work in Guangzhou and organized the "Vietnam Youth Revolutionary Comrades Association," training a large number of Vietnamese revolutionary youth. This organization was quickly organized throughout Vietnam.
    After the failure of the Chinese Great Revolution, he went to the Mekong River basin in central Siam (Thailand), where he carried out propaganda and education work among Vietnamese farmers. In February 1930, after the failure of the Yen Bai uprising in Vietnam, the Vietnam Youth Revolutionary Comrades Association unfortunately split into three factions, each claiming to be the Communist Party. But Ho Chi Minh persuaded the leaders of the three factions to unite organizationally. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Vietnamese revolutionary movement quickly entered a new high tide. Farmers took up arms and shouted slogans of "No taxes, no cooperation," attacking police stations and government offices everywhere. In Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces in central Vietnam, the insurgents even overthrew the colonial rule of French imperialism and established a people's government. This movement continued from April 1930 to May 1931. Due to the bloody suppression by French imperialism, the movement was temporarily stopped.
    In June 1940, the French Pétain government surrendered to Nazi Germany. In October of the same year, the Japanese army occupied Vietnam. In 1941, Ho Chi Minh led Vietnam's main democratic parties and people's organizations to establish the Vietnam Independence League, uniting the majority of the Vietnamese people and launching a resolute guerrilla war against Japanese imperialism and its French collaborators. The Vietnam Independence League's deep penetration into the countryside and its armed struggle opened the road to victory for the Vietnamese people. In order to establish contact with the Allied countries, Ho Chi Minh, on behalf of the Viet Minh, came to China from northern Vietnam. But as soon as he arrived in Guangxi, he was arrested by the Kuomintang reactionaries, imprisoned for fourteen months, and suffered all kinds of torture in prison. After his release, he returned to Vietnam and continued to lead the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, Ho Chi Minh led the people of the whole country to carry out the "August Revolution," seized power, and established a provisional democratic government on August 25. On September 2 of the same year, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam formally declared its independence. As a result of the general election on January 6, 1946, the People's Assembly was established, and on March 3 of the same year, Ho Chi Minh was elected Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    In order to strangle the newly born Democratic Republic of Vietnam and continue its eighty years of colonial rule in Vietnam, the French imperialists finally tore up all promises, abandoned the pretense of peace talks, and launched a full-scale war of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in December 1946. Under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the entire Vietnamese people carried out a heroic resistance against the French imperialists. Over the past four years, the Vietnamese people have become stronger and stronger in the war. Today, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has liberated more than 90% of the territory of Vietnam, established a strong armed force, carried out preliminary social reforms in the liberated territories, and largely eliminated illiteracy. Under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people are now actively engaged in the great patriotic war against American and French imperialism and their running dogs, fighting for the liberation of all of Vietnam.

　　越南人民领袖胡志明主席
    五月十九日是越南民主共和国的缔造者胡志明主席的六十寿辰。在这一天，全越南的爱国人民，都将为他们敬爱的领袖的健康长寿而欢腾庆祝。
    胡志明主席献身于越南人民的解放事业，已有四十多年。他于一八九○年生于越南中部义安的农家。年青时代，他就受到了当时反法运动的影响，积极参加了越南民族革命的工作。在第一次大战后凡尔赛和平会议期间，他正在法国，他向协约国代表团提出了越南独立八项要求的备忘录。帝国主义者虽然不理睬这一要求，但是这个文件在巴黎和越南广泛印发的结果，给了越南人民以很大的激励。
    胡志明在留居巴黎期间，曾组织了一个“殖民地联合会”，并出版《巴黎周刊》，揭露法国殖民地统治的罪恶，宣传殖民地民族的独立和解放。后来，他加入了法国社会党。当社会党内部分裂为第二国际和第三国际两派的时候，他在党代表大会上投票赞成加香等人所领导的第三国际派。
    一九二四年，胡志明离开法国，到了苏联。苏联的社会制度和人民生活，使他深受感动，也使他学习了许多的革命理论与经验。不久，他取道中国广州回越南。那时广州正是中国大革命运动的中心地。他在广州参加工作并组织了“越南青年革命同志会”，训练了大批越南革命青年。这一组织很快在越南全境组织起来。
    中国大革命失败以后，他到了暹罗中部的湄南河流域，在越侨的农民中进行宣传教育工作。一九三○年二月，越南安沛起义失败后，越南青年革命同志会不幸分裂为三派，都自称为共产党。但胡志明说服了三派的领袖，使他们在组织上统一起来。越南革命运动在共产党的领导下，迅速地进入了新的高潮。农民拿起武器高喊“不纳税、不合作”的口号，到处攻打警署和官厅，在中部义安和河静两省，起义者甚至一度推翻了法国帝国主义的殖民地统治，建立了人民政权。这一运动从一九三○年四月一直继续到一九三一年五月，由于法帝国主义的血腥镇压，运动才被暂时制止。
    一九四○年六月，法国贝当政府向纳粹德国投降。同年十月，日军进占越南。胡志明领导越南主要的民主党派和人民团体，于一九四一年成立了越南独立同盟，团结了大多数越南人民，对日本帝国主义及其法国合作者展开了坚决的游击战争。越南独立同盟的深入农村和进行武装斗争，打开了越南人民胜利的道路。为了和同盟国取得联系，胡志明曾代表越盟，从越南北部前来中国。但在刚刚抵达广西时，他即被国民党反动派逮捕起来，被囚十四个月，受尽了监狱的折磨。出狱后，他又回到越南，继续领导越南人民的革命斗争。一九四五年日寇投降后，胡志明领导全国人民，进行“八月革命”，夺取了政权，并于八月二十五日建立了临时民主政府。同年九月二日，越南民主共和国正式宣布独立。一九四六年一月六日大选的结果，人民议会成立，同年三月三日胡志明被选为越南民主共和国的主席。
    法帝国主义者为扼杀新生的越南民主共和国，以继续其在越南的八十年殖民地统治，终于撕毁一切诺言，放弃和谈假面具，于一九四六年十二月对越南民主共和国发动了全面的侵略战争。全越南人民在胡志明主席的领导下，对法国帝国主义者进行了英勇的抵抗。四年来，越南人民已在战争中越战越强。今天，越南民主共和国已解放了全越南百分之九十以上的领土，建立了一支坚强的武装，在解放的领土上已进行了初步的社会改革，文盲已大部消灭。越南人民在胡志明主席的领导下，现正积极进行反对美法帝国主义及其走狗的伟大爱国战争。为解放越南全国而战。
