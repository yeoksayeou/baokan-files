Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd: In the twenty days since the conclusion of the Third Shanghai People's Representative Conference, the labor-capital organizations in Shanghai's private industrial and commercial sectors have been holding consultative conferences, and their efforts to jointly overcome difficulties have achieved further results. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 74 labor-capital consultation meetings have been organized in various private industries and factories throughout the city, including 30 industries such as cotton spinning, dyeing and weaving, papermaking, and rubber, as well as 44 factories such as Xinyu Yarn Factory, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, and Tianjin Shipping Company. To date, the number of labor-capital consultation meetings has increased by 3.7 times compared to before the Third People's Representative Conference.

The establishment of labor-capital consultation meetings has enabled the current difficulties encountered by private industries to be resolved to varying degrees. For example, dozens of factories such as Huanqiu Iron Factory, Kaimeike Pharmaceutical Factory, Tianjin Shipping Company, Far East Silk Factory, and Jin Gang Rubber Factory have resolved some production difficulties, enabling production to be maintained. The capitalists of Far East Silk Factory, Jin Gang Rubber Factory, and others have repeatedly emphasized their difficulties and proposed to shut down and lay off workers. The capitalist of Far East Silk Factory even fled at one point. However, after discussions at the consultation meeting, the labor side, considering long-term interests, proposed methods such as discounting wages or even temporarily not taking wages and only eating from the "common pot" to reduce the factory's expenses, and urged the capitalist to return to the factory and find ways to continue operations. The labor side of Jin Gang Rubber Factory temporarily refrained from requesting the payment of two months' back wages, hoping that the capitalist would tighten expenses and use all funds for production.

Currently, the labor-capital consultation meetings in some units are gradually developing into the signing of agreements to increase productivity. For example, Xinyu Textile Company has signed an agreement on streamlining, economy, and self-sufficiency at breakeven point between labor and capital. The labor side guarantees to increase productivity, stipulating that the production of 20-count yarn per spindle per 20 hours should be 0.85 pounds. The output of the company's Factories One and Two and the Experimental Institute has increased significantly, with the Experimental Institute increasing to 0.95 pounds, exceeding the original plan. Factory One has also increased from 0.75 to 0.82 pounds. The consumption of cotton and electricity has also been reduced compared to before. The capitalist side has raised 5 billion yuan to prepare for the purchase of raw cotton to increase production.

Some manufacturers who were unable to continue production, such as Sheng Sheng, Jianhua, and Wanli silk factories in the silk weaving industry, also resolved issues such as dispersal, shutdown, and layoffs through labor-capital consultation.

　　上海工人发挥主人翁精神
    积极协助资方克服困难   
    若干单位订立提高生产率协议
    【新华社上海二十二日电】从本市第三届各界人民代表会议闭幕至今二十天中，上海市私营工商业劳资双方组织协商会议，共同克服困难的努力，已获得更进一步的成效。据不完全统计：全市各私营行业、工厂，共已组织起七十四个劳资协商会议，其中包括棉纺、染织、造纸、橡胶等三十个行业及新裕纱厂、美亚织绸厂、天津航运公司等四十四个工厂。至目前止，劳资协商会议已较第三届各界人民代表会议前增加了三点七倍。
    劳资协商会议的建立，使私营工业目前所遇的困难，得到了不同程度的解决。如寰球铁工厂、开美科制药厂、天津航业公司、远东绸厂、金刚橡胶厂等数十家，都已解决了生产中的若干困难，使生产得以维持。远东绸厂、金刚橡胶厂等资方曾一再强调困难，提出停工解雇；远东绸厂资方还一度逃跑；但经协商会议讨论后，劳方从长远利益着想，提出工资打折扣甚至暂时不拿工资、只吃“大锅饭”等办法，以减轻厂方开支；并促使资方回厂设法继续开工。金刚橡胶厂劳方则对资方前欠二个月工资暂不要求发给，希望资方紧缩开支，将一切资金用于生产。
    目前有些单位的劳资协商会议，并逐步发展到订立提高生产率的协议。如新裕纺织公司已在劳资双方间签订了精简节约、保本自给协议书，劳方保证提高生产率，规定二十支纱二十小时每锭生产为零点八五磅，该公司一、二两厂及实验所产量均已显著提高，实验所增至零点九五磅，超过原订计划；第一厂也由零点七五增至零点八二磅。用棉和电量亦比前节省。资方则已筹款五十亿元准备购置原棉，以增加生产。
    有些无法继续维持生产的厂商如丝织业中的升盛、建华、万丽等绸厂，亦经过劳资协商，解决了疏散、停工、解雇等问题。
