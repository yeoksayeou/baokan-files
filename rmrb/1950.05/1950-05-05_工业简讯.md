Industrial Briefs

    After receiving the task of producing 800 waterwheel pipes, the automobile repair and manufacturing factory of the Communications Bureau under the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, in order to ensure the completion of the task, all 151 craftsmen in various groups in the factory signed collective contracts one after another at the end of March, and the production efficiency increased by an average of 30%. Currently, the factory is considering signing a liaison contract to ensure the timely supply of materials between groups. (Liu Zhenya, Jie Qingyi)

    From April 2nd to 11th, the Liaoxi Provincial Department of Industry held the Provincial Third Joint Meeting of Mine Directors, Managers, and Heads. According to the province, only 95.3% of the original plan was completed in the first quarter, accounting for 10.92% of the total annual production task. The main reason is that the leadership of various factories and mines did not adequately grasp the progress of the production plan, emphasized objective difficulties, and neglected subjective efforts. They failed to establish a dedicated responsibility system and inspection system, resulting in many accidents, which greatly affected production. The meeting determined that in the future, all factories and mines should strengthen democratic management, establish and improve a sound dedicated responsibility system and inspection system, and fully implement cash management and promote supply and marketing work starting from May to ensure the completion of the second quarter's production plan.

　　工业简讯
    山西省人民政府所属交通局汽车修造厂，自接到生产水车管子八百部任务后，为保证任务的实现，全厂各组匠工一百五十一名，于三月底先后全部签订集体合同，生产效率平均提高百分之三十。现该厂为保证各组间及时供给材料，正在酝酿订立联系合同。                  （刘振亚、解庆义）
    辽西省工业厅自四月二日至十一日举行省营第三次矿厂长、经理、主任联席会议。按该省第一季生产仅完成原计划的百分之九十五。三，占全年生产任务总值的百分之十点九二。其主要原因是由于各厂矿领导上对掌握生产计划进度不够，强调客观困难，忽视主观努力，没有建立专责制和检查制，发生很多事故，影响生产很大。会议确定今后各厂矿要加强民主管理，建立健全专责制和检查制，五月份起并要全部实行现金管理，推广供销工作，以保证第二季生产计划的完成。
