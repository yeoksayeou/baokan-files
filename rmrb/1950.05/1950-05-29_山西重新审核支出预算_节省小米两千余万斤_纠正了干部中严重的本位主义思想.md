　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th: In order to eliminate waste and strengthen the unified management of local finances, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government has re-examined this year's financial expenditure budget. After revision, the new budget is reduced by more than 16% compared with the original budget, saving 27,294,000 jin of millet, making the local finances in line with the spirit of living within their means and achieving a balance of payments. As a result, the unreasonable phenomenon that the expenditure budget of most counties was greater than the income was corrected, the serious departmentalism among cadres was overcome, and their understanding of the importance of unified financial and economic work was strengthened.

　　In March, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government sent personnel to Xinxian, Yuci, Fenyang, Linfen, Yuncheng and other special districts to assist in reviewing the preparation of the local financial revenue and expenditure budgets of various counties. They found in their work that many counties did not pay enough attention to this work, and there were serious departmentalism and extravagance. For example, the annual local income of Fencheng County was 2,059,259 jin of millet, but the expenditure budget reached 4,700,514 jin, and the deficit was more than 128% of the original income. After review, only 1,572,888 jin was needed to cover the expenditure, and the reduction accounted for 66.57% of the original budget. In this way, the income could be surplus by more than 486,000 jin. This situation was very common. For example, some relatively wealthy counties could have a surplus of local grain, but the local leading cadres were afraid that they would be uniformly transferred to other places, so they deliberately prepared the budget as a balance of revenue and expenditure or a deficit. When some counties were preparing the revenue and expenditure estimates, the leading cadres did not ask or care, and made a hasty decision without discussion at the administrative meeting. All of this greatly increased the expenditure budget figures. Before the re-examination of the budget, the revenue and expenditure estimates of 59 of the 92 counties in the province could not be balanced. After the re-examination, only 21 counties really did not have enough income to cover the expenditure, but this difficulty could also be solved by appropriate adjustments within the scope of each special district.

　　The Shanxi Provincial People's Government held the third provincial financial section chiefs meeting from April 10 to 22, and finally reviewed the local financial revenue and expenditure estimates of various counties in accordance with the principles of the decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on unifying national financial and economic work. At the meeting, some cadres believed that "unified financial and economic work is a matter for the central and provincial people's governments, and the problems of special districts and counties are not big" and "local grain should be spent by the local authorities themselves" and other erroneous ideas were strictly criticized. At the same time, the meeting required all localities to resolutely implement that the expenditure ratio of various undertakings should not exceed the verified budget figures.

　　In order to further strengthen the leadership and management of local financial work, the Provincial People's Government, in addition to the special section set up by the Provincial Finance Department, has also decided to set up a local finance section in the special office and county finance department to be specifically responsible for the management of local finances.

　　山西重新审核支出预算
    节省小米两千余万斤       
    纠正了干部中严重的本位主义思想
    【新华社太原二十七日电】山西省人民政府为杜绝浪费，加强地方财政的统一管理，重新审核了今年度的财政支出预算。经修订后，新预算较原预算缩减百分之十六以上，节省小米二千七百二十九万四千斤，使地方财政符合量入为出的精神，做到收支平衡。因而纠正了大部县份支出预算大于收入的不合理现象，克服了干部中存在着的严重的本位主义思想，同时也加强了他们对统一财经工作重要性的认识。
    山西省人民政府于三月间曾派员分赴忻县、榆次、汾阳、临汾、运城等专区，协助审查各县地方财政收支预算的编制工作。他们在工作中发现不少县对于这一工作重视不够，存在着严重的本位主义和铺张浪费现象。如汾城县全年地方收入为小米二百零五万九千二百五十九斤，开支预算却达四百七十万零五千一百四十五斤，赤字竟为原收入的百分之一百二十八以上；经审核后，仅需一百五十七万二千八百八十八斤即敷开支，核减数占原预算的百分之六十六点五七。这样，收入反能盈余四十八万六千余斤。类此情形十分普遍，如有些较富裕的县的地方粮本可盈余，但当地领导干部恐怕因此被统一调拨运济外地，遂故意将预算编制成收支相抵或有赤字；有的县在编制收支概算时，领导干部不闻不问，未经行政会议讨论，即轻率决定。凡此都使支出预算数字大大增加。全省九十二个县在未重新审核预算时，有五十九个县的收支概算不能平衡，经审核后，收入真正不够开支的只有二十一个县，但是只需在各专区范围内予以适当调剂，这一困难亦可解决。
    山西省人民政府于四月十日至二十二日召开的全省第三次财政科长会议，根据中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定的原则，最后审核了各县地方财政收支概算。会上并对某些干部认为“统一财经工作是中央和省两级人民政府的事情，专区和县的问题不大”以及“地方粮应由地方自作主张开支”等错误观念，进行严格批判。同时，会议要求各地坚决执行各项事业费的开支比例不得超过所核定的预算数字。
    省人民政府为进一步加强对地方财政工作的领导和管理，除省府财政厅已设有专科管理外，并决定在专署、县财政部门内设地方财政股，专门负责管理地方财政。
