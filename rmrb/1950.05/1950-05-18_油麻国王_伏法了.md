Hunan Correspondence

　　"Oil Sesame King" Brought to Justice
　　Zhang Xing
　　The notoriously wicked Hunan big landlord Liu Meizhai (i.e., "Liu Yuezhi, the right-wing leader of Hunan" mentioned by Chairman Mao in the last paragraph of Chapter 3 of "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan"), was brought to justice in front of the people of Shiwang Township, Hengshan County.
　　Liu Meizhai lived in Youma Field, Shiwang Township, Hengshan County. He was nicknamed "Oil Sesame King." He was a Xiucai (successful candidate in the imperial examinations) from the late Qing Dynasty. Later, he colluded with the Gui clique of the Kuomintang and was appreciated by Zhao Hengti, the Hunan warlord, serving as a quartermaster in Zhao's army. He later served two terms as the Director of the Finance Department of the puppet Hunan Provincial Government, Standing Committee Member of the Kuomintang Hunan Provincial Party Department, Director of the Two Lakes Special Party Department, and puppet Yueyang County Chief. For decades, relying on his power, he committed all kinds of evil deeds, plundering the people's wealth. Before his execution, he still owned over 2,000 shi of land rent and three large buildings. The people of Hunan hated him to the bone.
　　　　One, actively opposing communism and brutally killing revolutionary martyrs.
　　During the Great Revolution, Liu Meizhai greatly slandered and opposed the vigorously developing peasant movement in Hunan and was expelled by the workers and peasants. After the "May 21st Incident," he returned to Hunan and devastated the peasant movement, carrying out a brutal massacre of revolutionary martyrs, Communist Party members, and leaders of workers and peasants in Hunan at that time. For example, in 1927, he instructed Kang Qingwan, the puppet Hengshan Tuandi Bureau Chief, to murder Xia Zhaomei (Deputy Manager of the Hengshan Farmers' Bank), etc. He secretly ordered Wang Zunyi, Wang Zhishan and other students from the puppet Party Affairs School to murder Comrade He Erkang, a Communist Party member who led the worker-peasant movement in Hengshan at the time, in Changsha. He's wife was also detained and imprisoned for two years, suffering inhuman torture and dying miserably in prison. More than ten revolutionary martyrs, including Zhou Shuping (Chairman of the Hengshan Federation of Trade Unions), Dai Liben (leader of Hengshan students), and Mao Daxiang (leader of Hengshan women), were murdered by him. The number of workers and peasants who suffered at his hands was even greater.
　　Last autumn, after the liberation of Hedong in Hengshan, Liu still refused to repent and fled to Hexi, convening an "expanded anti-communist meeting" in the Nanyue area and carrying out extensive anti-communist propaganda. As the People's Liberation Army advanced rapidly, Hexi was liberated in quick succession. This heinous murderer finally fell into the people's net.
　　　　Two, manipulating local administration, appearing as the "Oil Sesame King."
　　In the power struggles within the bandit gang, Liu was frustrated and returned to his hometown. Relying on the power of the rulers of Hunan, he did whatever he wanted, becoming a big local tyrant and evil gentry hated by everyone in Hengshan County. The puppet county chiefs of the county all had to obey him. His home was like a yamen (government office); whatever he said about county affairs had to be done. For example, Liu Wansheng, a habitual bandit from southern Hunan, and Liu Ribing, a murderer, were successively sentenced to death by the puppet county government, but he came forward to "bail" them out. Later, he ordered the two criminals to be baozhang (local head) and run the maintenance association, acting as his henchmen. All rural administration was completely controlled by him. For example, in 1939, under the pretext of organizing a self-defense force to maintain security in his hometown (Shiwang), he extorted five yuan and six jiao silver dollars from each household, and used more than forty shi of public welfare grain. After the self-defense force was established, it was only stationed in his village (Youma Field) to watch the door for him, while the required funds were borne by the entire township. For example, a duck herder in Xialiushi (near Youma) released a little water into a pond to make it easier for the ducks to find scattered dry rice in the fields. He added the crime of "obstructing water conservancy" and fined him eight silver dollars. The duck herder was unable to pay and was forced to give him all the ducks. Examples like this are endless.
　　　　Three, forcibly seizing wives from good families and occupying land and forests.
　　Near Liu's house, the wife of a farmer named Ma Gui was spotted by Liu and forcibly taken as a concubine. A good piece of land belonging to Liu Qingdong was forced to be sold to him, with only forty shi of coarse grain given in return. And a mountain forest belonging to the Xia family was forcibly occupied without giving a penny. The Ma, Liu, and Xia families had to swallow their anger for fear of the evil forces.
　　On the land and mountains he had occupied or forcibly bought, anyone who moved a single blade of grass had to slaughter a pig, erect a monument, and hold a banquet to apologize to him. Some even went bankrupt as a result; otherwise, they would be sent to the township police under the protection squad for torture. Once, two Xiangtan people were hunting birds on his mountain with bird guns. Because they were not locals and had no money to erect a monument or hold a banquet for him, they were arrested by the township police and severely beaten with forty strokes.
　　His two thousand shi of land were all rented out by tenant farmers. Regardless of drought, flood, or insect pests, the rent had to be paid in full. Anyone who asked for a reduction would be forcibly evicted.
　　After the liberation of Hengshan, the vast number of victimized masses filed lawsuits against Liu's crimes. The Hengshan County People's Government accepted the people's request, arrested Liu, and sentenced him to death by the court. The judgment was approved by the higher judicial authorities in accordance with the law. On April 13, the heinous "Oil Sesame King" was executed by shooting. The people of Shiwang Township, who were surrounding the execution ground, revealed smiles on their angry faces as the crisp gunshots rang out.

### “油麻国王”伏法了

　　“油麻国王”伏法了
　　张兴
    罪恶昭著的湖南大恶霸刘梅斋（即毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》第三章最后一段中提到过的“湖南的右派领袖刘岳峙”），在衡山县石湾乡的人民面前伏法了。
    刘梅斋住在衡山县石湾乡的油麻田。绰号叫“油麻国王”。他是废清的秀才出身，后来与国民党桂系沆瀣一气，为湖南军阀赵恒惕所赏识，在赵部作过军需官。后曾两任伪湖南省政府财政厅长及国民党湖南省党部常务委员、两湖特别党部主任委员、伪岳阳县长等职。数十年来，依仗权势，无恶不作，搜刮人民膏血，伏法前仍拥有田租两千余石、房屋三大栋。湖南人民无不恨之入骨。
            一、积极反共，残杀革命志士。
    大革命时代，刘梅斋对蓬勃发展的湖南农民运动，大加诋毁与反对，被工农群众所驱逐，逃到南京。“马日事变”后回到湖南，摧残农民运动；对当时湖南革命志士、共产党员与工农群众领袖，进行了残酷的屠杀。如一九二七年指使伪衡山团防局局长康庆万杀害夏兆梅（衡山农民银行副经理）等。当时领导衡山工农运动的共产党员贺尔康同志，即为其密令伪党务学校学生王遵义、王稚山等杀害于长沙；贺妻亦被扣押监禁两年之久，受尽非人酷刑，惨死于狱中。革命志士周树屏（衡山总工会会长）、戴厉本（衡山学生领袖）、毛达湘（衡山妇女领袖）等十余人，均被其谋害。遭其毒手的工农群众，为数更多。
    去年秋天，衡山河东解放后，刘匪仍怙恶不悛，潜逃河西，在南岳一带召开“扩大反共会议”，大肆反共宣传。由于人民解放军进军神速，河西踵接解放，这个罪大恶极的杀人罪犯，终于落入了人民的法网。
            二、把持地方行政，俨然“油麻国王”。
    在匪帮内部争权夺利的角逐中，刘匪失意，返回本乡，依仗湖南统治者的势力，为所欲为，成了衡山县里的一个人人痛恨的大土豪劣绅，该县历任伪县长，莫不俯首听命。他的家有如衙门，县里的事情，他说怎么办就得怎么办。如湘南惯匪刘万生和杀人凶犯刘日炳，曾先后被伪县府判处死刑，但又由他出面“保释”。以后即叫两犯当保长、办维持会，充当其爪牙。所有乡村行政，完全由他一手把持。如一九三九年，以组织自卫队，维持本乡（石湾）治安为名，向群众勒索每户银元五元六角，并动用公益积谷四十余石。自卫队成立后，只在他本村（油麻田）驻扎，替他看门，而所需款项，却由全乡负担。又如霞流市（油麻附近）一个看鸭的人，为了便于鸭子寻食散落在田里的干谷，放了塘里一点水，他即加以“妨害水利”的罪名，处罚金银元八元。看鸭者无力缴纳，被迫将鸭都给了他。像这样的例子，真是不胜枚举。
            三、强夺良家妻子，霸占土地山林。
    在刘家邻近，一个叫马贵的农民的妻子，为刘匪看中，就被强占为妾。刘清东的一段好田，被他强迫出卖，仅给粗谷四十石。而夏姓的一座山林，他竟一钱不给，无理强占。马、刘、夏三家，因慑于恶势力，只好忍气吞声。
    在他所霸占的或强买的田地和山岭上，谁要动了他一根茅草，就得杀猪、立碑、办酒席，向他陪不是，有的竟因此而倾家荡产；不然就是送到保镳的乡警那里非刑拷打。有一次两个湘潭人，持鸟铳在他山上打鸟，因非本地人，又没有钱，不能给他立碑、办酒席，就被抓到乡警那里毒打四十大板。
    他的两千石田，都是由佃户租种。不论水旱虫灾，都要足额交租，谁要要求减免，就强行退佃。
    衡山解放以后，广大受害的群众，纷纷控诉刘匪的罪行。衡山县人民政府接受了人民的请求，逮捕了刘匪，由法庭判处死刑。判决依法经上级司法机关批准了。四月十三日，恶贯满盈的“油麻国王”被枪决。围在刑场四周的石湾乡人民，随着清脆的枪声，愤怒的脸孔上露出了笑容。
