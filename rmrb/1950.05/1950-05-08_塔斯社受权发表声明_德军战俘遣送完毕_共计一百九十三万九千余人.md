　　塔斯社受权发表声明
    德军战俘遣送完毕
    共计一百九十三万九千余人
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：塔斯社发表关于德军战俘已从苏联遣送完毕的声明如下：
    一九四九年一月四日，塔斯社声明曾经指出：极大多数的德军战俘，到一九四八年年底时，都已从苏联遣送回德，其余战俘遣送回国的工作，正依照苏联政府所订的计划办理，将在一九四九年遣送完毕。
    塔斯社受权声明：最后一批一万七千五百三十八名战俘，现已遣送回德国。
    至此，德军战俘从苏联遣送回德国的工作已经完全结束。自从德国投降以来，已共有一百九十三万九千零六十三名德军战俘，从苏联遣送回德国。这个数字中，包括一九四七年——一九四九年，在苏联境内，属于其他国籍的战俘中间所发觉的五万八千一百零三名德军战俘在内。
    在德军战俘之中，有九千七百十七人因为犯了重大的战争罪行而被控，依然留在苏联，另有三千八百十五人，由于患病，暂缓遣送，俟治疗完毕后即将遣送回国。
