　　[Shanghai News] Liberation Daily News: The Tangyu River excavation project in northern Jiangsu has been successfully completed after the hard work of 60,000 laborers last winter and this spring. The river, sixty li long, stretches from Dingtang Ditch in Liandong County to Xiaojianzi in Binhai County, serving as the main drainage canal for the two counties. At the end of last November, the two counties seized the opportunity of the agricultural slack season to mobilize more than 36,000 laborers. They overcame the difficulties of the cold weather and completed 1.87 million cubic meters of earthwork in forty days. This spring, 24,000 laborers were mobilized to continue construction from February 6th, and the entire project was successfully completed by April 7th. A total of 3.39 million cubic meters of earth were moved. The People's Government used the work-for-food relief program to issue more than 7,168,000 jin of wages in grain. After deducting the food consumption of the laborers themselves during the work period, the laborers sent grain home, which solved the famine for about 80,000 family members. More than 1.64 million mu of farmland along the river will benefit. In previous years, if there had been such heavy spring rains as this year, the lake areas would have been flooded. This year, however, the accumulated water can be quickly drained. The seven districts along the river in the two counties estimate that the wheat harvest can increase by 50 million jin. During the river excavation campaign, more than 620 heroes emerged, and nearly 3,000 people were commended. More than 1,000 new Party members and more than 1,900 new League members were developed. One hundred and twenty Party members were promoted to village branch committee members.

　　苏北开凿唐豫河竣工
　　两岸一百六十余万亩良田受益 
    民工送粮回家八万人渡过灾荒
    【上海讯】解放日报消息：苏北唐豫河开凿工程经去冬今春六万民工辛勤努力，现已胜利完工。该河南起涟东县丁唐沟，北到滨海县小尖子，计长六十华里，为该两县排除积水之干渠。去冬十一月底两县争取农闲季节，动员民工三万六千余人，克服天寒地冻困难，作工四十天，完成土方一百八十七万公方，今春动员两万四千民工，于二月六日起继续施工，至四月七日，全部工程胜利完成。先后共做土三百三十九万公方，人民政府以工代赈发出工资粮七百十六万八千多斤，除去民工本身做工期间的食粮消耗，民工送粮回家约解决了八万家属的灾荒，沿河两岸计有一百六十四万多亩良田收益。往年如有今春这样大的春雨，湖荡地区早已一片汪洋，而今年积水却能迅速排尽，两县沿河七个区估计麦收可增产麦子五千万斤。在开河运动中，涌现功臣六百二十多人，记功的近三千人。并新发展党员一千多名，团员一千九百多名，党员提拔为乡支部委员的有一百二十人。
