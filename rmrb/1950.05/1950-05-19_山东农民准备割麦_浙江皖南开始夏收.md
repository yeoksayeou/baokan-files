　　Shandong Farmers Prepare to Cut Wheat
　　Summer Harvest Begins in Southern Anhui and Zhejiang
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th: Wheat crops are growing strongly in Shandong Province, promising a good harvest. Farmers across the province are adding agricultural tools to prepare for the wheat harvest. The province planted over 42.2 million mu of wheat last winter, accounting for 42 percent of the total cultivated land area. Due to sufficient and timely rainfall this spring, farmers in various regions also carried out timely wheat hoeing and topdressing, resulting in robust wheat seedlings. Now, the mountains and fields are covered with green wheat, and most of the wheat seedlings have already headed. It is estimated that harvesting will begin comprehensively in early June.
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th: Farmers in Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and other regions have begun summer harvesting. In Zhejiang Province, barley, rapeseed, and naked barley in some areas have been harvested. Early-maturing barley has already been brought to market in some areas of southern Anhui. Wheat in various regions will be harvested by the end of May or early June. Due to excessive spring rain and some areas suffering from hail, wheat rust, and smut diseases in the spring, this year's wheat crops are generally expected to yield about 30% to 40% less. However, thanks to the promotion and impetus of the People's Government, the cultivated area last winter and this spring has increased compared to previous years. For example, the Chizhou area in northern Anhui planted over 390,000 mu of wheat, rapeseed, peas, and other crops last winter, exceeding the previous year by more than 100,000 mu. After rent reduction in Zhejiang Province, the past restrictions imposed by landlords prohibiting farmers from planting spring flowers (wheat, beans) on rented land were lifted. Farmers universally increased planting of a season of spring flowers on rented land. In Shaoxing area alone, 1.47 million mu of wheat were planted last winter, an increase of more than 20 percent compared to previous years. Therefore, the actual harvest of wheat this summer is estimated to remain at the level of previous years, and may even increase slightly in some individual areas.

　　山东农民准备割麦
　　浙江皖南开始夏收
    【新华社济南十八日电】山东省各地麦棵茁壮，丰收有望。全省农民正添置农具准备麦收。全省去冬种麦面积共四千二百余万亩，占总耕地面积百分之四十二。由于今春雨水充足适时，各地农民又及时进行了锄麦和施追肥，麦苗肥壮。现满山遍野青麦遮地，大部麦苗业已出穗。据估计六月初即可全面开始收割。
    【新华社上海十八日电】浙江、皖南等地农民已开始进行夏收。浙江省的大麦、油菜及某些地区的裸麦已经收割完毕。皖南部分地区早熟大麦业已登场。各地小麦则将于五月底或六月初收割完毕。上述地区今年的麦苗，因春雨过多及部分地区曾在春季遭受冰雹和麦锈病、黑穗病等灾害，一般约歉收三成至四成左右。但由于各地农民在人民政府的提倡和推动之下，去冬今春的耕作面积均较往年增加，如皖北池州专区去冬播种麦、菜、豌豆等作物共达三十九万余亩，超过往年十余万亩。浙江省经过减租以后，解除了往年地主不准农民在租田上播种春花（麦、豆）的限制，农民普遍地将租田增种一季春花，仅绍兴专区去冬种小麦即达一百四十七万亩，较往年增加了百分之二十以上。因此，今夏麦子的实际收获量估计仍能保持往年的水平，个别地区还可能略有增加。
