　　Introduction to Mimeograph Technology
　　After the "Please Introduce Mimeograph Technology" by Jiang Yang was published in the People's Garden on April 23rd, we received many contributions from comrades with experience in mimeograph work. Due to space limitations, we cannot publish them all, so we have selected one article to publish. Others will be kept by this group, and those interested in mimeograph work can come to this newspaper to request them.

　　Ordinary steel stencil patterns are diagonal (like a diagonal cross), and the patterns vary in thickness; square grid stencils have horizontal and vertical patterns; Song typeface stencils have vertical lines that are straight and horizontal lines that are slightly slanted; border stencils are for making line borders; and rule line stencils are for drawing grid lines. For drafting, there are also tortoise shell stencils and drawing stencils (these are available in several types and are now difficult to purchase on the market). For protection, steel stencils should not rub against each other, should not be used indiscriminately (e.g., ordinary characters must be written on ordinary stencils, Song characters must be written on Song typeface stencils), and should not be exposed to moisture to prevent rust. Steel stencils should be brushed with gasoline frequently, preferably every day after use at the end of work.

　　Styluses are divided into writing styluses, dotted line styluses, border drawing styluses (such as spoon-shaped), and drawing styluses (including several types). Writing styluses should be frequently rubbed on an "oilstone," and each stylus can be used for two or three years; dotted line styluses should not be used directly on the steel stencil but can be rotated on the water frame of the steel stencil; when drawing borders, place the waxed paper flat on the stencil and apply the stylus back and forth, and the waxed paper should not be moved to avoid repetition; there are many types of drawing styluses, such as round, flat, and stubby, which have different uses. When using them, it is best to attach the waxed paper to the edge of the stencil with a soldering iron to prevent movement.

　　Font styles are divided into ordinary style, square style, Song style, imitation Song style, lead type style, cursive style, black letter style, and other styles.

　　The ink used for ordinary printing is mimeograph ink. For a glossy and clear finished product, stone printing ink can be used instead. Mimeograph ink is easily blurred when rubbed by hand after printing, while stone printing ink will not blur no matter how much it is rubbed after it dries. For mixing, mix the stone printing ink on a glass plate, add kerosene, and grind it finely with an ink spatula to remove any lumps before use.

　　Waxed paper should be made of Ganpi paper, and the wax should be thin and transparent, and crisp when shaken by hand. When using it, the waxed paper and steel stencil can be parallel. If the waxed paper is used vertically, the steel stencil should be placed vertically; if it is used horizontally, the stencil should be placed horizontally.

　　When printing, first place the paper to be printed on the bottom plate of the machine, place the written waxed paper flat in the middle of the white paper, lower the gauze frame, and use the heat of a soldering iron to stick it to the frame, which is more standard.

　　For color separation stencils, such as three-color forms, first glue three sheets of waxed paper together (only glue the four corners), then use dashed lines to create the format, so that each sheet of waxed paper has the same format, with one sheet of waxed paper for each color, and then draw the solid lines for each color on the steel stencil. When printing, it is necessary to adjust the registration on the machine so that each color is printed accurately. In addition, when printing four-page large prints, it is necessary to join the prints. This method also requires gluing the waxed paper together, first drawing dashed lines, then drawing solid lines, and then printing so that the joints are tightly joined.

　　For drawing patterns and pictures, it is necessary to have all the steel stencils ready and all the tools, such as flower-shaped rulers and cloud-shaped rulers. When drawing, the shading is shown by the thickness of the stencil patterns, which requires practical research to be easy to print.

### 介绍油印技术

　　介绍油印技术
    人民园地四月二十三日刊出了姜羊的“请介绍油印技术”后，接到许多对油印工作有经验的同志的来稿。因为篇幅关系，不能一一刊载，特选刊一篇。其余留存本组，对油印工作有兴趣者，可来本报索阅。
    编者
    普通钢版版纹为斜纹（如斜十字），版纹有粗细之别；方眼版版纹为横平竖直；宋体版竖纹直、横纹稍斜；花边版为做线边之用、罗线版为划表格线条之用；制图时另有龟纹板、绘图版（此版有数种现市上很难购买）。其保护法，钢版与钢版不宜磨擦，不宜乱用（如写普通字必要在普通版上写，宋字必须在宋体版上书写），不宜受潮湿，以免版上生锈；钢版应时常用汽油刷洗，最好每日用过在工作结束时刷擦一遍。
    铁笔分写字笔、点线笔、绘制花边用笔（如匙形）、绘图笔（内分数种）等。写字笔宜常在“油石”磨擦，每笔可使用两三年；点线笔使用时不可在钢版上，可在钢版之水框上推转：绘制花边时将腊纸平放版上用笔往返涂抹，腊纸不宜移动，以免重复；绘画笔种类颇多，如圆形、扁形、秃形，用法不同，使用时最好将腊纸用烙铁贴于版边上，以防移动。
    字体分为普通体、方体、宋体、仿宋体、铅字体、形书体、黑体字等体形。
    普通印刷所用油墨系誊写墨，为着印刷成品光润，清晰可改用石印墨。誊写墨印后墨干用手去抹容易模糊，石印墨则干后无论如何擦摸不会模糊。调制方法，将石印墨调在玻璃板上，加入煤油，用墨铲细研，使其没有一块一块的，便可使用。
    腊纸宜选用雁皮纸制，腊宜薄而透明，用手抖之轻脆，使用时腊纸与钢版可成平行，腊纸竖用则钢版竖放，横用则版横置。
    印刷时，先将所印之纸放于机器底版上，将写好腊纸平放白纸中间，放下纱布框，用烙铁的热粘于框上，然后再印，比较正规。
    套色制版如三色表格，先用三张腊纸粘合一处（只将四角粘上即可），然后用虚线打出格式，则每一张腊纸有同样格式，每一色一张腊纸，再将每色的实线在钢板上划出。印时必需将机器上之规矩搞好，每色每色的印，则非常正确。此外印刷四开纸大的印刷品必需接印，此写法亦须将腊纸粘连一起，先划虚线，后划实线，然后再印则相接处密合。
    绘制图案、图画，必须钢版齐备；工具如花形尺、云形尺等俱全。绘制时则以版纹粗细而显阴影，需实际研究方易印刷。
