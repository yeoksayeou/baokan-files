Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 9th: Jichang, Qitai, Shanshan, and other twelve counties in the Dihua District of Xinjiang, as well as Hami and Zhenxi in eastern Xinjiang, and Yanqi, Hejing, Wensu, Aksu, Shache, and Hotan in southern Xinjiang, have successively convened their first People's Representative Conferences of All Ethnic Groups and All Circles from late March to early April. Through these representative conferences, the counties publicized various policies of the People's Government, especially the ethnic policies, enhanced the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and all circles, and initially laid the foundation for the people's democratic united front. Workers and peasants accounted for the majority of the representatives of all ethnic groups and all circles. For example, among the 518 representatives from Dihua, Hotan, Hami, and Yanqi counties, there were more than 250 worker and peasant representatives; at the same time, other democratic classes also had a considerable number of representatives. In electing and inviting representatives, the counties took care to include ethnic groups with small populations, ensuring that they could also have representatives participate. The representative conferences in all counties focused their discussions on how to improve spring plowing and production, and passed resolutions to launch spring plowing and production campaigns. After the meetings, mutual lending and assistance movements were widely carried out in the counties to help households in difficulty with spring plowing. For example, after returning to his village, the Uyghur representative Batu from Dihua County took the lead in lending seeds and cattle to help seven Han households solve their spring plowing difficulties. According to incomplete statistics, the seeds mutually lent and assisted in the twelve counties of the Dihua District alone amounted to more than 1,300 dan, and more than 400 cattle and horses were mutually lent. The People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in the counties also organized democratic management water conservancy committees to preside over the distribution of water and the dredging and repairing of wells. The People's Representative Conferences of Hami, Shanshan, and other counties also stipulated restrictions on elements who manipulated water usage to facilitate irrigation.

　　新疆迪化区各县
　  召开各族各界人民代表会议
　　奠定人民民主统一战线基础
    【新华社西安九日电】新疆迪化区吉昌、奇台、鄯善等十二县及东疆的哈密、镇西，南疆的焉耆、和靖、温山、阿克苏、莎车、和阗等县，已先后于三月下旬至四月上旬召开了第一届各族各界人民代表会议。各县通过代表会议，宣传了人民政府的各项政策，特别是民族政策，增进了各族各界人民的团结，初步奠定了人民民主统一战线的基础。各族各界代表中，工人、农民代表占多数。如迪化、和阗、哈密、焉耆等四个县的五百十八个代表中，工农代表有二百五十余人；同时，其他各民主阶层亦均有相当数量的代表。各县在选举和聘请代表时，都注意照顾了人口少的民族，使他们也能有代表参加。各县代表会议都以如何做好春耕生产作为讨论中心，通过了展开春耕生产的决议。会后，各县普遍开展了互借互助运动，以帮助困难户进行春耕。如迪化县维族代表巴吐回乡后，即带头出借籽种、耕牛等，帮助七户汉民解决了春耕困难。据不完全统计，仅迪化区十二县互借互助的籽种即达一千三百多担，互借耕牛和马四百余头。各县各界人民代表会议还组织了民主管理的水利委员会，主持分配用水和掏渠修井。哈密、鄯善等县人民代表会议并对操纵用水的分子，规定了限制办法，以便利灌溉。
