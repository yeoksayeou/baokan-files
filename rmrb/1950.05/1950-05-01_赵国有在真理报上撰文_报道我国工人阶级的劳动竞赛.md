　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: According to TASS Moscow, Zhao Guoyou, a worker from the Shenyang No. 3 Machinery Factory and a member of the Chinese trade union delegation that arrived in Moscow to participate in the May Day celebrations, wrote an article in Pravda on the 29th, describing the labor emulation campaigns of the working class in New China. He said: The labor emulation campaigns in our country began last year; and during the period of welcoming this year's May Day, this movement has been widely carried out throughout the country. At first, the competition was individual in nature; later it gradually became a movement of groups of advanced workers; now, all workers in some enterprises are participating in the competition. In the factory where I work, many workers have overfulfilled their production targets by one to two times. All 169 workers who joined the Communist Party have taken the lead in setting an example. The workers' competition has increased output, improved product quality, and saved production materials. Chinese workers have realized the greatness of the working spirit of the Soviet Stakhanovite workers and are actively learning from this example, engaging in production in the rear with a selfless labor attitude to support the operations of the People's Liberation Army on the front lines. The government also gives honorary rewards to heroes in production, just as it does to heroes on the battlefield. A large number of women in New China have also actively participated in various tasks of production and construction. They have now taken on many jobs that were previously thought to be only suitable for men.

　　赵国有在真理报上撰文
    报道我国工人阶级的劳动竞赛
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：抵达莫斯科参加“五一”劳动节庆祝大会的中国工会代表团团员、沈阳第三机械厂工人赵国有，二十九日在真理报上撰文，描叙新中国工人阶级劳动竞赛的情形。他说：我们国家的劳动竞赛是从去年发动起来的；而在迎接今年“五一”劳动节的期间，这一运动已经在全国各地普遍地开展起来。在起初，竞赛是个人性质的；后来便逐渐变成了成群的先进工人的运动；现在，有些企业里全部工人都参加了竞赛。在我工作的工厂中，许多工人都超额地完成了他们生产目标的一倍到两倍。其中所有的一百六十九名加入共产党的工人，首先起了模范和带头的作用。工人们的竞赛提高了产量，改进了产品质量，并节省了生产原料。中国工人们已经认识到苏联斯塔哈诺夫式工人的工作精神之伟大，并且积极学习这种范例，以忘我的劳动态度在后方从事生产，来支援前线人民解放军的作战。政府对于生产中的功臣也像对于战场上的功臣一样，给予他们以荣誉的奖励。大批新中国的妇女们也都积极地参加了生产建设中的各项工作。她们现在已经担负起向来认为男人们才能够担负的许多工作了。
