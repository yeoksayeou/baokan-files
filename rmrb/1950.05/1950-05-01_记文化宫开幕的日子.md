Remembering the Opening Day of the Cultural Palace
    Mu Yang
    On the morning of April 30th, the "Beijing Laboring People's Cultural Palace" was unveiled on the left side of Tiananmen Square – the former site of the Imperial Ancestral Temple. A plaque with an inscription personally written by Chairman Mao was horizontally embedded in the middle of the pine branch archway at the entrance. The grand ceremony was held at around 11:00 AM in the pine forest on the right side of the Cultural Garden inside the palace. After Xiao Ming, the Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, finished speaking about the preparations, Li Lisan and other guests from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions offered their congratulations to the worker representatives present. Each forceful speech received prolonged applause.

    As everyone knows, forty years ago, this cultural palace for the laboring people was the place where the Manchu Qing dynasty's royalty worshiped their ancestors. On the first and fifteenth of every month, those "filial" princes and grandsons spent vast amounts of silver – the blood and sweat squeezed from the laboring people – to reverently commemorate their ancestors' "achievements" in establishing their rule over the vast populace. However, the true creators of history and the builders of this palace, for centuries, not a single one dared to step into this forbidden land. In the subsequent thirty or forty years, it became a place solely for a small number of upper-class Chinese men and women to adjust their lives. It was also a place that the laboring people were unwilling to come to and rarely visited. However, this grand ceremony has started a new page in the history of this palace.

    The main hall is the original main hall of the Imperial Ancestral Temple, precisely the place where feudal emperors worshiped their ancestors. It is now being used by the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to exhibit more than 600 photographs introducing the Soviet Union's economic and cultural construction. In the future, it will become a place for laboring people to gather. The rear hall has been converted into a library, neatly arranged with over 4,000 volumes of 96 kinds of book series, more than 30 kinds of newspapers, and 70 kinds of magazines. The majority are popular readings suitable for the general level of the laboring people. In the side halls on both sides of the main hall and the rear hall, mass activity rooms, recreation rooms, art rooms, music rooms, dance rooms, and drama rooms have been set up as classrooms and activity centers for small gatherings, games, and various cultural training classes in the future. Currently, more than 700 photographs related to the workers' movement, women's movement, the Anti-Japanese War – the Liberation War, Chairman Mao's arrival in Beijing, and the opening of the CPPCC, as well as more than 100 workers' art pieces, are being exhibited separately in these rooms.

　　记文化宫开幕的日子
    穆扬
    四月三十日上午，“北京市劳动人民文化宫”在天安门广场的左侧——太庙旧址揭幕了。一块由毛主席亲笔题字的匾额，横嵌在门口松枝牌坊中间。盛典于十一时许在宫内文化园右侧的松林中举行。当北京市总工会副主席萧明讲完筹备经过后，中华全国总工会李立三等来宾纷向与会的工人代表们致贺。每一段有力的演辞，都得到经久不息的掌声。
    谁都知道，在四十年以前，这座劳动人民的文化宫还是满清皇族祀奉他们祖先的地方。每个月的初一、十五，那些“孝顺”的皇子皇孙们，都耗费了浩多的银两——从劳动人民身上压榨来的血汗——敬奠他们祖先在建立统治广大人民的基业时的“功勋”。而历史的真正创造者、这座宫殿的建造者，几个世纪来却没有一个人敢于跨进这片禁地。在此后的三、四十个年头里，这里就成为仅供少数高等华男、华女调节生活的所在。也正是劳动人民所不愿来和很少来的地方。然而这个盛典却使这座宫殿开始了新的史页。
    大礼堂是原来太庙的正殿，正是封建帝王祀奉他们祖先的地方。现在正由北京市中苏友好协会展览着六百多帧介绍苏联经济、文化建设方面的照片。今后将成为劳动人民集会的地方。后殿已改为图书馆，里边整齐地排列着四千多册、九十六种丛书，三十多种报纸和七十种杂志。大部都是适合于劳动人民一般水平的通俗读物。在大殿与后殿两旁的侧殿中，分设了群众室、游艺室、美术室、音乐室、舞蹈室、戏剧室，作为今后小型集会、游戏以及各种文化训练班的教室和活动的中心。现在，七百多张有关工运、妇运、抗日战争——解放战争、毛主席来京与政协开幕的照片和一百多幅工人的美术作品，正分别展览在这些屋子里。
