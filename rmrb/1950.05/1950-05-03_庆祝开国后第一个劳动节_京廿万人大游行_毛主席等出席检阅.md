Xinhua News Agency, 1st of the month: The capital, Beijing, today celebrated the first International Labor Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China with a grand parade of more than 200,000 people. Participating in the parade were the land, sea, and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, workers from various factories in the capital, government employees, citizens, students, and public security forces. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government, Vice Chairmen Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, and Zhang Lan, as well as members of the Central People's Government Committee, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, heads of various departments, ministries, commissions, administrations, and banks of the Central People's Government, and more than 300 leaders of the Communist Party of China and various democratic parties and people's organizations attended the review of the parading troops. Ambassadors from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, Romania, Hungary, Poland, India, and other countries, as well as the Soviet Communist Youth League delegation and the Indonesian trade union delegation, attended the ceremony.

Despite the continuous rain in the capital today, the masses participating in the parade began marching towards Tiananmen Square in formation from 10:00 AM, holding high the red flags. Many teams beat drums and gongs, danced the Yangko dance, and sang happy and militant songs as they marched.

On the solemn and beautiful Tiananmen Gate, a huge portrait of Chairman Mao was hung in the center, and portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were hung on both sides of the gate tower, which served as the reviewing stand.

Chairman Mao Zedong and others arrived at the venue at 3:00 PM. Nie Rongzhen, Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, announced the start of the parade, and twelve cannons fired one hundred and twenty salvos, while the military band sang the national anthem of the People's Republic of China and the Internationale.

The parade was led by more than 10,000 soldiers from the land, sea, and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The rostrum and the stands welcomed this powerful people's armed forces as they passed in the rain with thunderous applause.

Following the People's Liberation Army troops were the worker contingents. Forty thousand workers walked hand in hand, twenty abreast, past the rostrum. The workers enthusiastically shouted: "Long live May Day!" "Workers of the world, unite!" "Defend Peace!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Stalin!" When they saw Chairman Mao waving to them from the reviewing stand and heard Chairman Mao shouting "Long live" to them, many people jumped up and threw their hats into the air, shouting: "Salute to Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Cheers and enthusiastic applause intertwined on and off the stage.

Following the workers were the contingents of 30,000 people from the People's Government agencies, cultural and educational workers, artists, and women's organizations. Behind them were citizens from all districts of Beijing, men and women, young and old. Next were 50,000 students from various schools and the Young Pioneers of China. The paraders enthusiastically shouted "Long live" to the reviewers on the reviewing stand and exchanged salutes. When the student contingents passed through Tiananmen Gate, it was already dusk. After the rain, the sky showed evening clouds and rainbows, and the People's Air Force flew overhead in neat "August 1st" formations, adding to the excitement of the entire audience.

In the parading ranks, the thousands of five-star red flags fluttering in the wind made the broad, verdant East and West Chang'an Avenues appear particularly magnificent. At the front of hundreds and thousands of teams, huge portraits of Chairman Mao were held high, as were huge portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The workers sang loudly "We Workers Have Power," and the students sang loudly "The New China Youth March," "Mao Zedong is the victorious sun, shining on our progress...", accompanied by the storm-like slogans that rose and fell one after another: "Attack Taiwan! Liberate all of China!" "Workers of the world, unite!" "Oppose new war instigators! Defend world peace!" Dozens of waist drum teams beat the drums with "Dong! Dong!" sounds, shaking the streets.

At the end of the parade were the capital's public security forces. As the troops marched in neat steps across the square, applause and the slogan "Long live the People's Public Security Forces" resounded until the entire contingent had completely passed. The parade ended at 8:15 PM in the evening.

　　庆祝开国后第一个劳动节
    京廿万人大游行  毛主席等出席检阅
    【新华社一日讯】首都北京今日以二十余万人的盛大游行庆祝中华人民共和国成立后的第一个国际劳动节。参加游行的有中国人民解放军陆海空军部队，首都各工厂的工人，机关工作人员，市民，学生，公安部队。中央人民政府毛泽东主席，朱德、刘少奇、宋庆龄、李济深、张澜副主席以及中央人民政府委员会委员，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员，中央人民政府各院、部、会、署、行首长，中国共产党及各民主党派、各人民团体领袖三百余人均出席检阅游行队伍。参加观礼的有苏联、捷克、朝鲜、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、波兰、印度等国的使节及苏联共产主义青年团代表团、印度尼西亚职工代表团等。
    今日首都虽阴雨绵绵，但参加游行的群众从上午十时起就高举红旗列队向天安门广场进发。很多队伍在行进中敲着锣鼓，跳着秧歌舞，唱着快乐的战斗的歌曲。
    在庄严美丽的天安门上，毛主席的巨像悬在正中，门楼即检阅台的两侧，高悬着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的画像。
    毛泽东主席等于下午三时到达会场。北京市人民政府聂荣臻市长宣布游行开始，十二门礼炮齐放一百二十发，军乐队齐唱中华人民共和国国歌及国际歌。
    游行行列以中国人民解放军陆海空军部队一万余人为前导。主席台上及观礼台上以雷鸣般的掌声欢迎这强大的人民武装在雨中通过。
    紧接着人民解放军部队行进的是工人队伍。四万个工人手挽着手，二十人一排，并肩地从主席台前经过。工人们热烈地高呼着：“五一劳动节万岁！”“全世界工人阶级联合起来！”“保卫和平！”“毛主席万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”当他们看见毛主席在检阅台上向他们招手，听到毛主席向他们高呼万岁的时候，很多人跳起来把帽子抛到空中，高呼着：“向毛主席致敬！”“毛主席万岁！”台上台下交织着欢呼声和热烈的鼓掌。
    接着工人前进的是人民政府机关工作人员、文化教育工作者、艺术工作者和妇女团体的三万人的队伍。在他们后面的是北京市各区的男女老少的市民群众。随后是各学校的学生和中国少年儿童队共五万人。游行者都热烈地和检阅台上的检阅者齐呼万岁，并互致敬礼。当学生的队伍通过天安门时，已经傍晚，雨后的天空出现了晚霞和彩虹，人民空军排着整齐的“八一”队形凌空而过，增加了全场群众的兴奋。
    游行队伍中，迎风招展的千万面五星红旗，使宽敞的两旁翠绿的东西长安街显得特别壮丽。千百个队伍的前头，都高举着毛主席的巨像，也高抬着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的巨像。工人们高唱着“我们工人有力量”，学生们高唱着“新中国青年进行曲”、“毛泽东是胜利的太阳，照耀着我们前进……”的歌声，伴随着彼伏此起的暴风雨般的口号声：“打到台湾去！解放全中国！”、“全世界工人阶级联合起来！”、“反对新战争挑拨者！保卫世界和平！”数十个腰鼓队打着“咚！咚！”的鼓声，震撼着街道。
    在游行的队伍最后行进的，是首都的公安部队。当队伍迈着整齐的步伐走过广场的时候，掌声和“人民的公安部队万岁”的口号声一直响到整个队伍完全通过。游行在晚间八时一刻结束。
