　　Hope Court Authorities Swiftly Handle Housing Disputes
    To the Editor:
    A few days ago, there was a rain in Tianjin. One wall of the house I rented out is in danger of collapsing. The tenant is now asking me to repair the house, but I haven't received rent for several years and don't have the money to repair it. I asked the tenant to pay for the repairs first, and then deduct it from the rent after the Supreme People's Court makes a judgment. The tenant refused.
    Therefore, I hope that the People's Court will quickly clear up the backlog of housing dispute appeals as soon as possible, so as not to hinder the progress of housing repairs and affect the safety of urban housing due to the lack of a judgment.
    At the same time, I also hope that the Supreme People's Court and the People's Courts at all levels will not keep the accepted cases for too long.

　　希望法院当局迅速处理房屋纠纷编辑同志：
    前几天，天津下了场雨。我租给人家的房子一面墙有倒塌的危险。租户现在找我修理房子，可是我好几年没有收到房租，没有钱修理。我叫租户先拿钱修理，等最高人民法院判决后，再从房租里扣除。租户又不答应。
    所以我希望人民法院从速把积压的房屋纠纷的上诉案件，赶快清理一下，以免因为没有判决，而妨碍了房屋修理的进行，影响了城市房屋的安全。
    同时我还希望最高人民法院及各级人民法院，把受理案件不要积压太久。
     仁民
