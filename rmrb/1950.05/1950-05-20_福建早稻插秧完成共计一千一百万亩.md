Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 14th: Fujian Province has completed the early rice transplanting work on eleven million mu of land. In the southern Fujian region, the climate is warm, and early rice transplanting was completed around Qingming (April 5th). In the colder northern Fujian region, early rice transplanting was also completed before Lichun (May 6th). More than four million mu of mid-season and late-season rice fields are currently being plowed. Since the beginning of spring, the province has enjoyed favorable weather conditions, and attention has been paid to preventing and controlling rice stem borers, so the rice seedlings are growing very robustly. The Fujian Military Region troops are actively carrying out bandit suppression to protect farmers' rice transplanting; many areas have also established militia joint defense to prevent bandits and special agents from sabotage and robbery. In areas where early rice transplanting has been completed, farmers are actively engaged in water conservancy construction, weeding, applying top dressing fertilizer, and preparing for famine.

　　福建早稻插秧完成共计一千一百万亩
    【新华社上海十四日电】福建省已经完成了一千一百万亩的早稻插秧工作。该省闽南地区气候温暖，早稻插秧于清明（四月五日）前后即已结束，较寒的闽北地区早稻在立夏（五月六日）前亦已插秧完毕，尚有四百余万亩中稻和晚稻田正在翻犁。全省今春以来风调雨顺，各地并注意进行防治螟虫工作，因而稻苗长得极为壮旺。福建军区部队正积极进行清剿土匪，保护农民插秧；不少地区还建立了民兵联防，防止土匪特务破坏抢劫。在已完成早稻插秧的地方，农民们正在展开兴修水利、耘田、施追肥及备荒等工作。
