　　陕西棉田普遍下种
　　小麦扬花大麦结子
    【新华社西安十一日电】盛产棉麦的陕西省关中平原地区，棉田已普遍下种，麦田已扬花结子。渭南、临潼、蓝田、华阴、华县、潼关等县棉田已有百分之九十播种，大荔、武功、长安、干县、三原、咸阳亦有全部或大部下种。但渭南分区部分棉田现发生缺苗现象，该省农业厅已派员分赴各区领导群众抓紧补种。
    全区小麦现已长至胸前，高约四市尺，正出穗扬花。大麦一部分已结子，并泛发白色，颗满丰硕。各地豌豆棵高蔓大，最好者已开花结角。其他扁豆、油菜等夏田作物，也都结果肥大。各种豆类至夏历四月初芒种左右，即可开始收割。据有经验的农民说，今后只要少雨无风，小麦、豆类定能丰收。各地农民现正以无比欢欣的心情，开始进行夏收准备工作，购买镰刀、桑杈、扫帚等。
