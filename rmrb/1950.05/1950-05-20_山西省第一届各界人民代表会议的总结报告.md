　　Summary Report of the First Session of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Shanxi Province
　　Cheng Zihua
(Editor's note: This article is a report by Cheng Zihua, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, to the 28th Government Affairs Council meeting of the Central People's Government on April 14th. Its experience can be used as a reference for other regions.)

The First Session of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Shanxi Province officially opened on March 12th this year. The conference, centering on the major topic of launching a year-round large-scale production campaign, exercised the functions and powers of the Provincial People's Congress in accordance with the Organizational Rules for the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Provinces promulgated by the Central People's Government. It discussed and approved nine resolutions, including the six-month work report of the Provincial People's Government, the government's policy and tasks for 1950, the draft budget of financial revenue and expenditure and the decision to support the central government's unified national financial and economic work, support for the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, and support for severely punishing Japanese bacterial warfare criminals. It elected the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and members of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Consultative Committee, and held a groundbreaking ceremony for the revolutionary martyrs' monument. The conference lasted for fifteen days and closed on March 26th. The following is a report on the conference's proceedings, gains, and experiences, as well as shortcomings in the work:

            I. Preparatory Work Before the Conference

The experience of the preparatory work is twofold: first, the convening of the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in counties and cities prepared the ground for the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the province; second, the preparatory group and the preparatory committee made direct preparations for the conference.

Since the Shanxi Provincial People's Government issued a circular to all counties in September last year to prepare for the convening of the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles, by the time the conference opened, all 92 counties and 7 cities with a population of over 30,000 in the province, except for Jing Le, Fanshi, Daixian, Wuzhai, and Ningwu counties, had convened the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles. Sixteen counties had convened it twice, and Taiyuan City had convened it eight times. Initially, in some counties, the composition of the representatives to the conference included too many CCP members, turning it into a cadres' meeting. After the provincial government's explanation and correction, the scope of representative selection was greatly expanded. At first, the representatives in various places had concerns. After the government reported on its work, the conference discussed it, and after the meeting it was conveyed, they understood that they could not only speak, but their words would be effective, so they dispelled their concerns. The people also expressed satisfaction with the representative conferences, believing that they had communicated with the government and enhanced their sense of ownership. Cadres saw that all resolutions passed by the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles were implemented very smoothly, and they also recognized the importance of the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles. Therefore, the convening of the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in counties and cities enabled the people and cadres to recognize the significance and role of the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in practical experience, and also enabled the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the province to absorb many proposals and synthesize methods and experiences.

After the decision was made to convene the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the province and approved by the Government Affairs Council of the Central People's Government, the provincial government organized a preparatory group on December 8th last year to begin preparatory work, and established and convened a preparatory committee in late February this year. The preparatory committee reviewed and approved the representative units and quota allocation and election methods proposed by the preparatory group, drafted draft rules and regulations for the representative conference, elected the proposal sorting committee and representative qualification preliminary review committee for the representative conference, studied the provincial government's work in the past six months and the two reports on the policy and tasks for 1950, and carried out other preparatory matters.

The Organizational Rules for the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Provinces promulgated by the Central People's Government did not originally stipulate a preparatory committee. In order to ensure that the conference had more adequate preparation beforehand, with the approval of the Government Affairs Council, a preparatory committee was established. In its work, it fully promoted democracy and initiative, and jointly discussed and decided on all preparatory work with the provincial government. This proved to be very effective. All the preparatory committee members, with an enthusiastic, serious, proactive, and responsible spirit, conducted detailed discussions on various draft rules and regulations and other preparatory work, and demonstrated full democracy and unity, which resulted in great gains in the preparatory work. The 65 preparatory committee members who attended included representatives from all democratic parties, people's organizations, all circles, all regions, and minority nationalities in the province. In fact, it was a microcosm of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the province. Therefore, the successful completion of the preparatory committee's work laid a good foundation for the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the province. The examination of proposals and representative qualifications should have been carried out by the conference. However, since many proposals from the preparatory committee and various counties had already been submitted, in order to prepare the proposal review committee of the conference and save the conference time, they were first sorted by category. At the same time, if the representative qualification review committee was established after all the representatives had arrived, the work would inevitably be rushed. Therefore, a preliminary review committee for representative qualifications was established, whose members were selected by the preparatory committee, equal to half the number of members of the representative qualification review committee, to conduct preliminary review. The remaining half of the members would be elected by the conference to establish a representative qualification review committee for the final review.

            II. Representatives, Elections, and Handling of Proposals

There were 401 official representatives and 48 alternate representatives at the conference. The official representatives included: 13 from the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, 7 from the Communist Party, 5 from the Democratic League, 5 from the New Democratic Youth League, 5 from Taiyuan City, 21 from Xinxian Special District, 21 from Xingxian Special District, 30 from Yuci Special District, 16 from Fenyang Special District, 36 from Changzhi Special District, 30 from Linfen Special District, 33 from Yuncheng Special District, 12 from the Shanxi Provincial Military Region, 3 from the Public Security Forces, 25 from the Trade Union, 25 from Farmers, 10 from the Women's Federation, 4 from the Youth Federation, 7 from the Student Federation, 4 from the Literary Federation, 4 from Government Agencies, 5 from Cooperatives, 10 from the Industrial Sector, 4 from the Transportation Sector, 10 from the Commercial Sector, 4 from Journalists, 2 from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, 2 from Natural Scientists, 6 from Educators, 2 from the New Political Science Society, 1 from the Sports Association, 3 from the Medical Sector, 3 from Revolutionary Veterans and Families of Martyrs, 2 from the Hui Nationality, 3 Democratic Personages from Religious Circles, and 28 Specially Invited Democratic Personages. The alternate representatives included: 2 from the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, 1 from the Communist Party, 1 from the Democratic League, 1 from Taiyuan City, 4 from Xinxian Special District, 3 from Xingxian Special District, 5 from Yuci Special District, 3 from Fenyang Special District, 5 each from Changzhi, Linfen, and Yuncheng Special Districts, 2 from the Shanxi Provincial Military Region, 3 from the Trade Union, 3 from Farmers, 1 from the Democratic Women's Federation, 2 from the Industrial Sector, and 2 from the Commercial Sector. Except for the 28 specially invited representatives who were invited by the government and the preparatory committee through consultation, the rest were formally elected or selected by various units and regions, giving full attention to the breadth and representativeness of the representatives.

The elections of the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and members of the Provincial People's Government and the Consultative Committee were all carried out in accordance with the election methods adopted by the conference. First, the conference approved a total of 31 members for the Provincial Government Committee and 3 Vice-Chairmen; a total of 45 members for the Consultative Committee and 4 Vice-Chairmen. According to the provisions of the election methods, formal candidate lists were decided upon through consultation and submitted to the conference for election, but representatives still had the right to nominate other candidates if they disagreed with the candidate lists. As a result of the election, the vast majority of the candidates received unanimous votes, and at least 90% of the votes. The representatives were all satisfied with this and believed it was true democracy.

The conference received a total of 1,816 proposals, which were consolidated into 576 items, including: 654 items related to production and construction, 394 items related to finance and economy, 385 items related to culture, education, and health, 308 items related to politics, 66 items related to public security, and 9 items related to military affairs. We handled so many proposals according to the regulations of the proposal review committee: those related to policies and tasks were discussed in small groups and at the conference, and those that could be adopted were incorporated into the policies and tasks and the budget of financial revenue and expenditure; those related to specific work suggestions or opinions, some of which had already been implemented and some of which were included in the plan, were handed over to the relevant departments for explanation or adoption with the consent of the conference. The answers to the proposals were printed and distributed to the representatives before the end of the conference. Therefore, except for seven items that were rejected because they contradicted the laws and regulations of the Central People's Government, all the others were handled in the above-mentioned manner, which not only seriously handled the proposals, but also saved the conference time.

The overriding central task of the conference was production and construction, and the goal was to develop industry. This year, we must strive to restore industry and vigorously restore agricultural production to lay the foundation for the development of industry. In the entire national economy, we should strengthen the leading role of industry over agriculture, cities over rural areas, and the public sector over the private sector. The central task of production and construction is not isolated, but it is not on par with other tasks. Other tasks must be completed around this central task.

The conference established organizations such as the presidium, secretary-general and deputy secretary-general, the proposal review committee, and the representative qualification review committee, and under the leadership of the secretary-general, it established two departments, the secretariat and the administration, which were responsible for the daily affairs of the conference.

After the opening of the conference, the Consultative Committee elected 19 resident members, who were responsible for maintaining close contact with the representatives, exchanging information, and striving to smoothly carry out various tasks.

            III. Gains and Experiences

This conference consistently implemented a new democratic style and raised the representatives' awareness of their role as masters of the country. First of all, the three important reports made by the government to the conference, after group discussion and conference discussion, were widely spoken. Representatives raised many questions, such as requests for reports on last year's financial revenue and expenditure, purchase prices for cotton and peanuts, circulation of silver dollars, support for private industry and commerce, and reasons for the collapse of some handicraft cotton weaving industries. At the meeting, the government was responsible for answering and supplementing the reports one by one. All correct opinions were adopted, and incorrect opinions were seriously explained. Finally, unanimous approval was obtained. Respect for proposals and resolutions: all opinions on specific work were answered by various departments seriously and responsibly, and all those that should be approved by the conference were submitted to the conference for discussion and approval. All the regulations and rules passed by the conference were resolutely and seriously implemented, and never discounted. The representatives all believed that the government attached great importance to their opinions and deeply felt their status as masters of the country (for example, some farmer representatives said after listening to the government's supplementary explanation of the financial situation: "No matter how much money is spent, there will always be an explanation"). The conference maintained a serious and responsible spirit in all discussions and decisions, not only making resolutions, but also paying attention to how to implement them.

During the conference, government leaders were always humble and sincere, respecting the opinions of the representatives, and especially paying attention to minority opinions. For example, the representative of Wutai raised opinions on the circulation of silver dollars and disagreement with deposit indexation. Due to time constraints, he did not finish speaking at the time. The next day, the conference asked him to speak again and asked him to write out his detailed opinions, and government leaders gave a detailed explanation at the conference. The provincial government appropriately conducted self-criticism of some correct criticisms, and focused on the leadership's inspection of the deviations that occurred in the work of lower levels. Therefore, many representatives reflected that the government dared to review itself at the conference, and did not conceal its shortcomings at all, and expressed its responsibility to the people everywhere. This is truly the people's government, so how can the work not be done well in the future! This strengthened the representatives' trust in the government and believed that the various resolutions of this conference would be implemented. Because of the government's spirit, many representatives spoke freely, whether in the presidium, the conference, or the group meetings, thus promoting the conference's unprecedented unity.

A major gain of the conference was that after listening to the government's report on the draft budget and reading the instructions of the Government Affairs Council of the Central People's Government "Decision on Unified Financial and Economic Work," it deeply understood the financial difficulties of the people's country. The worker and farmer representatives accepted the production tasks for 1950 with great pleasure and full of confidence. The representatives of industry and commerce came with opinions that the industrial and commercial tax and the public bonds were very heavy, and requested a reduction. After understanding the current financial difficulties of the government and the current arduous tasks, understanding that farmers not only paid a huge burden of manpower, material resources, and financial resources in the ten years of war, but also the current public grain burden is still very heavy, and the difficult living conditions of the People's Liberation Army and the supply system cadres, their thinking changed. They believed that it is necessary to bear the burden at present, but it must be balanced. Secondly, the conference also resolved some of the doubts of some representatives of industry and commerce and specially invited representatives about the industrial and commercial policy. The government's policy and task report and the speech of the representative of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China explained the necessity of developing private industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and criticized the "down with capitalism" left-leaning erroneous thinking in the speech of a certain education representative. A specially invited representative said: "In the past, I have not heard of allowing the development of private industry and commerce, but this time it is clear." Some specially invited representatives, enlightened gentry representatives, and some old intellectuals representatives initially held a wait-and-see attitude, believing that the production enthusiasm in the rural areas after the land reform was not high, and were pessimistic about rural production. They were very concerned about the government's policy of uniting and transforming old intellectuals and the measures for landlords who fled to the cities. After the government's explanation of the policy of transforming and using old intellectuals in the report and the policy of resettling the fleeing landlords to return to their hometowns for production, after the labor heroes among the farmer representatives gave a vivid report that the production enthusiasm of the liberated people on the free land was exceptionally high, and some had exceeded the pre-war level, and the representative of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China gave a correct explanation of the land reform movement and the deviations that occurred, the conference conducted group discussion and out-of-meeting discussions on all these issues, so that everyone's understanding tended to be consistent. Some of the old military and government personnel before liberation were invited to be representatives this time, and they all expressed their happiness, believing that it was a pleasant surprise, and expressed their determination to start from scratch and serve the people.

The government's report on the draft budget of financial revenue and expenditure in 1950 gave the representatives a good impression. Some representatives who had worked in the old regime felt that the old government never disclosed financial revenue and expenditure. This time, we disclosed the financial revenue and expenditure situation. At first, they felt very strange and very happy. Many representatives put forward proposals and opinions that could not be achieved by the government. To sum up, they wanted both stable prices and reduced burdens, and also asked for more spending. After listening to the report on the financial situation, they felt that displaced people could no longer be taken in and should be mobilized to return to their hometowns for production. Many plans also agreed to temporarily abandon them. The burden could not be reduced, and they deeply understood that the people's government's financial policy was to take from the people and use it for the people. This proves that the above-mentioned achievements cannot be achieved without publishing and discussing the draft budget of financial revenue and expenditure. In short, due to the agreement on various ideological understandings, the unity of this conference is quite solid.

In addition, the conference proved that the form of group discussion and free deliberation outside the meeting is convenient for representatives to speak widely, pour out their hearts, and is therefore the best form for widely concentrating opinions, specific research, and solving problems. General conference discussions are often subject to restraint. This conference adopted more group discussions and free deliberation methods, which achieved great results. Secondly, in the reception of the representatives' lives, it is necessary to give special care to the elderly and weak representatives and not adopt egalitarianism.

            IV. Shortcomings in the Work

The shortcomings of this conference can be pointed out in the following three aspects:

(1) Before the conference, the provincial government's instructions on the election of representatives in various places were not detailed enough, and a few regions did not pay enough attention to it. It did not fully publicize and deliberate among the masses, and the representatives were produced in a relatively hasty manner, so that some individual representatives did not know what they were here to do after arriving at the conference.

(2) During the conference, the help to the representatives was not universal enough, especially the help to the worker and farmer representatives was poor.

(3) Due to the subjective belief that it was the first meeting, it would be better to be longer, and not give everyone a non-democratic feeling due to being rushed. Therefore, the control of time was not tight enough. When passing the rules and regulations, some of the discussions that focused on the wording were not corrected in time, so the meeting time was slightly prolonged, making a few representatives feel tired, and there was a phenomenon of being loose at the beginning and tight at the end.

　　山西省第一届各界人民代表会议的总结报告
　　程子华
    （编者按：本文是山西省人民政府程子华主席四月十四日在中央人民政府政务院第二十八次政务会议上的报告。其经验可供各地参考。）
    山西省第一届各界人民代表会议于今年三月十二日正式开幕。会议以开展全年大生产运动为中心课题，根据中央人民政府省各界人民代表会议组织通则，代行了省人民代表大会职权，讨论并通过了省人民政府六个月工作报告、一九五○年政府施政方针与任务、财政收支概算及拥护中央统一全国财经工作的决定、拥护中苏友好同盟互助条约、拥护严惩日本细菌战犯等九个决议案，选举了山西省人民政府及省协商委员会主席、副主席、委员，并举行了革命烈士纪念碑奠基典礼。会议共历时十五日，于三月二十六日闭幕。兹将大会经过情况、收获与经验、以及工作中的缺点分别报告如下：
            一、会前的准备工作
    准备工作的经验有二：一是县市各界人民代表会议的召开，给省各界人民代表会议做了准备；二是筹备小组和筹备委员会给大会作了直接准备。
    山西省人民政府自去年九月通令各县筹备召开各界人民代表会议以来，截止大会召开前，全省九十二县和七个三万人口以上城市，除静乐、繁峙、代县、五寨、宁武五个县外，均已开过各界人民代表会议，其中开过两次的有十六个县，太原市开了八次。最初，有些县代表会代表成份中中共党员多，成了干部会，经省府解释纠正，代表人选的范围就扩大多了。各地代表们开始有顾虑，在会议中经政府报告工作，大会讨论及会后传达，他们才了解不仅可以说话，而且说了顶事，于是把顾虑解除了。人民对代表会议也表示满意，认为与政府通了气，提高了主人翁的感觉。干部看到凡是经过各界人民代表会议讨论通过的各种决议，执行都非常顺利，也都认识了各界人民代表会议的重要。所以县市各界人民代表会议的召开，使人民和干部在实际经验中认识了各界人民代表会议的意义和作用，也使省各界人民代表会议吸收了许多提案，综合了方法和经验。
    在决定召开省各界人民代表会议，并经中央人民政府政务院批准后，省府于去年十二月八日组织筹备小组，开始筹备工作，并于今年二月下旬成立和召开了筹备委员会，审查和通过了筹备小组提出的代表单位及名额分配与选举办法，草拟了代表会议各种章则草案，推选了代表会议提案整理委员会及代表资格初审委员会，研究了省府六个月以来的工作和一九五○年施政方针与任务两个报告，及进行了其他各种筹备事宜。
    中央人民政府省各界人民代表会议组织通则，原没有筹备委员会的规定，为使会议事前有较充分的准备，经政务院批准后，成立了筹备委员会，在工作中充分发扬民主和积极性，与省府共同商定进行一切筹备工作。这样做证明效果很好，全体筹委以热烈认真积极负责的精神，对各种章则条例草案及其他准备工作，进行了详尽的讨论，且表现了充分的民主和团结精神，使筹备工作得到很大收获。到会的六十五个筹备委员，包括了全省各民主党派、人民团体、各界、各地区和少数民族的代表人物，事实上就是省各界人民代表会议的一个缩影。因此，筹备委员会工作的顺利完成，就给省各界人民代表会议打下了良好的基础。关于提案和代表资格的审查，本应由大会进行，因筹备委员会和各县的提案已送来很多，为给大会提案审查委员会作好准备工作，先加分门别类的整理，以节省大会时间，就决定由筹备委员会成立提案整理委员会；同时，如等代表到齐后再成立代表资格审查委员会进行代表资格的审查，工作必然仓促，故成立代表资格初审委员会，其委员由筹备委员会推选等于代表资格审查委员会委员的半数，进行初步审查，其余半数委员俟由大会推选，成立代表资格审查委员会进行最后审查工作。
            二、代表、选举和提案的处理
    大会正式代表四百零一人，候补代表四十八人。计正式代表：山西省人民政府十三人，共产党七人，民主同盟五人，新民主主义青年团五人，太原市五人，忻县专区二十一人，兴县专区二十一人，榆次专区三十人，汾阳专区十六人，长治专区三十六人，临汾专区三十人，运城专区三十三人，山西省军区十二人，公安部队三人，工会二十五人，农民二十五人，妇联十人，青联四人，学联七人，文联四人，机关四人，合作社五人，工业界十人，交通界四人，商业界十人，新闻工作者四人，中苏友好协会二人，自然科学工作者二人，教育工作者六人，新政治学会二人，体育分会一人，医药界三人，荣军、烈军属三人，回民二人，宗教界民主人士三人，特邀民主人士二十八人。候补代表：山西省人民政府二人，共产党一人，民主同盟一人，太原市一人，忻县专区四人，兴县专区三人，榆次专区五人，汾阳专区三人，长治、临汾、运城专区各五人，山西省军区二人，工会三人，农民三人，民主妇联一人，工业界二人，商业界二人，除特邀代表二十八人由政府与筹备委员会商定聘请外，余均由各单位及地区正式选举或推选产生，充分注意了代表的广泛性与代表性。
    省人民政府及协商委员会主席、副主席和委员的选举，都是依照大会通过的选举办法进行的。首先由大会通过省府委员名额共为三十一人，副主席名额三人；协商委员会委员名额共为四十五人，副主席名额四人。根据选举办法规定，经过协商决定正式候选名单，提交大会选举，但代表对候选名单如仍有不同意者，还有另提候选人之权。选举结果，凡候选人，绝大多数是全票，至少得票也在百分之九十以上。代表们对此都表示满意，认为是真正的民主。
    大会共收到提案一千八百一十六件，经整理合并为五百七十六件，计：生产建设类六百五十四件，财政经济类三百九十四件，文教卫生类三百八十五件，政治类三百○八件，治安类六十六件，军事类九件。我们处理这样多的提案，是根据提案审查委员会组织规程的规定：凡属方针任务方面的，经小组会和大会讨论，凡可采纳者吸收入方针与任务和财政收支概算中去；凡属有关各种具体工作的建议或意见，有的已在执行，有的列入计划，经大会同意分交有关部门解释或采择处理，并将对提案的解答意见于会议结束前印出，发给了各代表。故除七件因与中央人民政府法令相抵触未予受理外，其余均经上述办法加以处理，这样既认真的处理了提案，又节省了大会的时间。
    会议中压倒一切的中心任务是生产建设，目标是发展工业。今年必须努力恢复工业，并大力恢复农业生产，以为发展工业奠定基础。在整个国民经济中，应加强工业对农业、城市对乡村、公营对私营的领导作用。生产建设的中心任务不是孤立的，但也不是与其他工作平列的，其他工作要围绕着这个中心任务而完成其本身的任务。
    大会设主席团、正副秘书长、提案审查委员会和代表资格审查委员会等组织，并在秘书长领导下设秘书、行政两处，分别掌管大会日常事务。
    大会开幕后，协商委员会即推选常驻委员十九人，负责经常与各代表取得密切联系，互通情报，以求顺利执行各项任务。
            三、收获与经验
    这次会议始终贯彻着新的民主作风，提高了代表们主人翁的觉悟。首先是政府向大会作的三个重要报告，经过小组酝酿和大会讨论，发言极为普遍。代表们提出了不少问题，如要求报告去年财政收支，棉花和花生收购价格，白洋流通，对私人工商业扶植及一些手工棉织业垮台原因等等。会上，由政府负责一一作了解答和补充报告，凡是正确意见，均被采纳，不正确的意见，都认真的作了解释，最后获得一致通过。对于提案决议的尊重：凡是具体工作的意见，均由各部门认真负责一一作了解答，应由大会通过的，均提经大会讨论通过。大会所通过的各种条例章则，均坚决认真的执行，从未打过折扣。代表们都认为政府很重视他们的意见，深切感到自己的主人翁地位（如有些农民代表在听了政府财政情况补充说明后说：“不论花钱多少，总有个交代”）。大会对一切的讨论与决定，都一贯保持认真负责的精神，不仅作了决议，而且注意到如何贯彻。
    在大会进行中，政府领导干部处处虚心诚恳，尊重代表意见，特别重视少数的意见，如五台代表提出流通白洋及不同意折实存款的意见，因发言时间限制，当时未全部讲完。第二天大会再请他讲，且请他把详细意见书面写出，并由政府领导干部在大会上给了详细解答。省府对一些正确的批评恰当地进行了自我批评，对下级在工作中所发生的偏差，着重领导方面的检查。因此不少代表反映，政府敢于在大会上检讨自己，对缺点丝毫不加掩盖，处处表示对人民负责，这真正是人民的政府，对今后工作那还有作不好的呢！由此更加强了代表对政府的信任，认为这次大会的各种决议一定能贯彻下去。由于政府这种精神，使不少代表不论在主席团内，大会或小组会内，都畅所欲言，因而煲进了大会的空前团结。
    大会上的一个主要收获，就是在听取政府财政概算报告及读了中央人民政府政务院《关于统一财经工作决定》等指示后，深刻了解了人民国家的财政困难。工农代表以十分愉快与充满信心的热情接受了一九五○年的生产任务。工商业代表来时带着工商业税、公债很重的意见，要求减轻，经过了解目前政府财经困难与当前的繁重任务，了解了农民不仅在十余年战争中，支出了人力物力财力的极大负担，即现在的公粮负担，也仍然很重，及人民解放军与供给制干部生活艰苦的情况后，思想上起了转变，认为目前需要负担，但须平衡。其次，大会上又解决了一部分工商业代表及特邀代表对工商业政策的怀疑。政府方针与任务报告及中共山西省委代表发言中都说明了发展有利于国计民生的私人工商业的必要性，并批判了某教育界代表发言中“打倒资本主义”的左倾错误思想。有个特邀代表说：“过去我没有听见过允许私人工商业发展，这次可明确了。”一些特邀代表、开明士绅代表及一部分旧知识分子代表初来时抱着观望看风头的态度，认为土改后的农村生产情绪不高，对农村生产抱悲观。他们很关心政府对旧知识分子团结改造方针及逃亡在城市里的地主的措置。经过政府报告中对旧知识分子改造使用方针及对逃亡地主还乡生产安置政策的说明，经过农民代表中劳动英雄讲了翻身后自由人在自由土地上的生产情绪异常高涨，有的已超过战前水平的生动报告，及中共山西省委代表对土地改革运动及其发生的偏向给以正确的说明解释后，会议对所有这些问题，进行了小组酝酿讨论及会外便谈，使大家的认识趋于一致。又有一部分解放前的旧军政人员，这次被邀聘为代表，一致表示愉快，认为喜出望外，表示决心从头做起为人民服务。
    政府关于一九五○年财政收支概算的报告，给代表们以很好的影响。有些在旧政权中做过事的代表，觉得旧政府从来不公开财政收支的，这次我们把财政收支情况公开了，开始他们感到很奇怪，很高兴。许多代表提出了不能为政府作到的提案和意见，归纳起来是：既要物价稳定，又要负担减少，还要求多加开支。及至听了财政情况的报告以后，觉得流散人员不能再收，应动员回乡生产，许多计划也同意暂时不搞，负担还不能减轻，且深刻了解了人民政府是取之于民用之于民的财政政策。这证明财政收支概算不公布讨论，则不能达到以上这些成绩。总之，由于取得了各种思想认识上的一致，故此次会议的团结是相当巩固的。
    此外，会议证明：小组讨论形式和会外的自由酝酿，便于代表广泛发言，倾吐心事，因而是广泛集中意见，具体研究和解决问题的最好形式。一般大会讨论发言往往受到拘束，这次会议较多地采取了小组讨论和自由酝酿的方式，取得很大成绩。其次，会议在对代表生活的招待上，对年老和体弱的代表特别给予适当照顾，不采取平均主义是必要的。
            四、工作中的缺点
    这次会议的缺点，可以指出以下三项：
    （一）会前省府对各地选举代表指示不够详细，少数地区对此不够重视。没有在群众中充分地进行宣传酝酿，代表产生比较仓促，以致有个别代表到会以后，还不知自己是来干什么的。
    （二）大会过程中，对代表的帮助还不够普遍，尤其对工农代表帮助较差。
    （三）由于主观上认为第一次会议，宁长些，勿因紧促而给大家以不民主的感觉，因此对于时间掌握不够紧，在通过章则规程时，有些偏重字句的讨论未及时纠正，以致会议时间稍为拖长，使少数代表感到疲倦，而有前松后紧的现象。
