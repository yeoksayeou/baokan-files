　　Xinhua News Agency, Rome, May 25th: The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization convened its fifth session in Florence, Italy, on the 22nd. At the first meeting, the Czechoslovak representative, Hofmanster, reminded the conference that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China had declared that it did not recognize the Kuomintang group's "representative" as the legitimate representative of the Chinese people, and proposed expelling the Kuomintang "representative." This proposal was seconded by the Hungarian representative, Tolna. However, the Australian representative, Valk, who was chairing the meeting, said that the resolution could not be passed until the Credentials Committee had presented its report on the matter, and proposed that the meeting should "currently" continue its work with the participation of the Kuomintang "representative." The Czechoslovak and Hungarian representatives protested this proposal and left the meeting.

　　捷匈代表退出联合国又一组织抗议国民党残匪“代表”出席
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社罗马讯：联合国教育、科学及文化组织于二十二日在意大利牙佛罗伦萨召开第五届大会。在第一次会议上，捷克斯洛伐克代表霍夫曼斯特提醒大会注意中华人民共和国中央人民政府宣布它不承认国民党集团的“代表”为中国人民合法代表的声明，并提议开除国民党“代表”。这一提议为匈牙利代表托尔纳所附议。但是，担任主席的澳大利亚代表瓦尔克竟说，在资格审查委员会提出它对这个问题的报告以前，不能通过上项决议，并提议“目前”会议应在国民党“代表”参加下继续工作。捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利代表抗议这一提议，并退出会场。
