　　Improving Our Work
    ——A Review of the Editorial Work of the First Volume of "People's Literature"
    《People's Literature》She

    "People's Literature" was founded on the day of the founding of the People's Republic of China and has now published eight issues. Thanks to the care and supervision of the leadership, and the help, love, and support of the broad masses of readers, writers, and literary workers, this publication has been able to exist and grow, contributing some strength to the literary construction of the new China.

    Recently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals." Our editorial department responded to the call and conducted a preliminary review of the editorial work of the first six issues, conducting a self-examination of the editorial work.

    The main task of this publication is to publish literary creations. When this publication was founded, Chairman Mao gave us an inscription of guiding significance: "Hope that more good works will be produced." We followed this instruction and strived to publish some better creations in this publication. In the past six issues, we have indeed published some works that have been welcomed and loved by the broad masses of readers. These works reflected the heroic deeds of the great People's Liberation War, the social changes in China, the features of production and construction, and praised the revolutionary new heroism... These works played a certain educational role. We have also published some theories and translations that are of guiding significance for literary construction and the development of people's literature. Many readers have also given us enthusiastic encouragement. These are some of the achievements we have made in our work. We should consolidate these achievements and continue to work hard.

    However, this publication has not yet reached our ideal and fully met the requirements of readers. The main thing is that its combat effectiveness is not enough. This is first reflected in the fact that the ideological level of the published creations is generally not high enough, the exposure of contradictions between the old and new things is not deep enough, and the reflected surface is not wide enough. It cannot promptly reflect the most important and urgent issues of the current situation, especially the number of works on industrial construction is very small, accounting for only a very small proportion of the six issues, while industrial construction is of paramount importance in our country. Of course, this is also subject to some restrictions on submissions, but the editorial staff has indeed not put much effort into organizing such manuscripts.

    This publication focuses on publishing creations and does not provide enough help to novice writers and general literary youths, and the specific, careful, and patient guidance is not enough.

    Secondly, theoretical criticism has not been organized in a more planned way. At present, there are many problems in literary creation. Our publication should often show what we are advocating and what we are opposing in this very complex phenomenon, organize authoritative criticism, so that our literary creation can move forward.

    What should be especially reviewed is that we have published very bad works in the first volume, such as "Let Life Become Better" (Volume 1, Issue 5). The author originally wanted to describe the anti-feudal thoughts in the countryside through the character of Xiao Huan. However, the author focused on showing a kind of unhealthy thought of this woman demanding enjoyment. Although Xiao Huan said that she had nothing to do with others except Daqun, she also said: "Can't you find a little fun?" "What's the point of living a lifetime of suffering?" "I just want to live a happy life." (So the title of this article is also "Let Life Become Better.") This is not the real thought of the working people. The solemn mission of literature and art is to carry out propaganda and education to the broad masses of the people with instructive thoughts, and at the same time criticize incorrect and unhealthy thoughts. In this work, the author did not criticize Xiao Huan's unhealthy thoughts and style, but misunderstood this thought and style as anti-feudal thoughts and style. This is the main reason why this work is bad.

    When the author dealt with the mobilization of joining the army, Xiao Huan was portrayed as a key figure. The author overemphasized her role in the conscription movement, thus the most important driving force in the rural conscription movement – the leadership of the Party, and the political consciousness of the emancipated peasants were very carelessly ignored. Among the emancipated peasants, there were indeed some peasants who hoped to join the army after getting married, but this was only an individual phenomenon in the conscription movement, and individual phenomena are sometimes very far away from the normal essence of things, or even contradictory. The author neither wrote about the normal essence of things, but highlighted the individual phenomenon, so the reflected reality was distorted. And the anti-feudal leader – the branch – was relegated to a subordinate and secondary position.

    Another example is "Transformation," which tells the story of a "small local tyrant landlord" being transformed. The author used a lot of space to describe this landlord as a waste, and excessively pursued fun, but did not write about the basis of this landlord's life – exploitation. In this way, the cruel, insidious, and vicious face of the landlord class in the exploitation of the peasant class was blurred. Therefore, the antagonistic relationship between the landlord class and the peasant class was also diluted. (This issue published two criticisms of "Transformation" and a self-examination by the author, which can be consulted.)

    In addition, there are also some works that have no meaning or very little meaning.

    Although the author is responsible for such works, in this journal, the editor should be primarily responsible.

    Most of the contributors to this journal are novice writers. They enthusiastically hope that we will give them help in creation. We have tried our best to do so. Most of the works published in this journal are written by these young writers. Even if they are not used, we will tell them more detailed opinions. Many readers also wrote to us to raise various literary questions, and we also tried our best to answer them. However, how to plan to publish some articles guiding writing in response to the existing problems in the creation of these novice writers has been done very poorly.

    The reason for the above shortcomings is that our political and ideological level is not high, and our research on business is far from enough. To improve our work, we must strengthen political and literary theory learning, constantly carry out strict self-criticism, and continuously improve our business. We welcome the criticism and supervision of the masses of readers. Only under the criticism and supervision of the masses can we timely discover errors and shortcomings, and timely correct errors and shortcomings, so that this publication can be better edited and play its due role in the literary construction of the new China.

　　改进我们的工作
    ——《人民文学》第一卷编辑工作的检讨
    《人民文学》社
    《人民文学》创刊于中华人民共和国成立的日子，到现在，已出了八期。由于领导上的关心和督促，广大读者群众、作家、文艺工作者的帮助爱护与支持，这个刊物才得以存在和成长，在新中国的文学建设中贡献了一些力量。
    最近，中国共产党中央委员会颁发了《关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定》，我们编辑部响应号召，曾把第一卷的六期编辑工作做了一次初步的检查，对于编辑工作进行了检讨。
    这个刊物主要的任务是刊登文学创作。毛主席在这个刊物创刊的时候，曾给我们以具有指示意义的题词：“希望有更多好作品出世”，我们遵照这个指示，努力想在这个刊物上，刊登一些较好的创作。在过去的六期中，我们确也刊登了一些为广大读者群众所欢迎与喜爱的作品，这些作品反映了伟大的人民解放战争中的英勇事迹，中国的社会变革，生产建设的面貌，表扬了革命的新英雄主义……这些作品是起了一定的教育作用的。我们也刊登了一些对于文学建设，对于人民文学的发展有指导意义的理论和翻译。许多读者也曾给予我们热情的鼓励。这是我们的工作所获得的一些成绩。我们应该巩固这些成绩继续努力。
    但是，这个刊物还没有达到我们的理想和完全满足读者的要求，主要的是它的战斗性不够，这首先表现在所发表的创作，一般的思想水平还不够高，揭露新旧事物的矛盾还不够深刻，反映的面也还不够广，不能及时反映当前最重要和最迫切的问题，特别是关于工业建设的作品数量很少，六期中只占有极少的篇幅，而工业建设在我们国家里却具有头等重要的意义。这里当然也是受来稿的一些限制，但编辑部同人也的确没有化很大的力量去组织这一类稿子。
    这个刊物因为侧重于刊登创作，对初学写作的和一般的文艺青年帮助不够，具体的，细心耐烦的指导不够。
    其次，没有比较有计划地组织理论批评。目前文艺创作中存在着许多问题，我们的刊物应该在这十分复杂的现象中经常表明我们在提倡什么，反对什么，组织有威信的批评，使我们的文艺创作能推进一步。
    特别应该检讨的，我们在第一卷里，曾刊登过很不好的作品，例如《让生活变得更美好罢》（一卷五期），作者原想通过小环这个人物来描写农村中反封建思想的。但作者却着力地表现了这个女人的一种要求享乐的不健康的思想，小环虽然说过她除了大群，和别人没有什么，但她却也说：“就不兴找一点乐趣了？”“苦一辈子，活着还有什么意思哩？”“想把日子过痛快一点罢了。”（所以这篇文章的题目也叫做《让生活变得更美好罢。》）这不是真正的劳动人民的思想。而文学艺术的庄严的使命，是以富有指导性的思想，向广大的人民群众进行宣传教育，同时批评不正确的与不健康的思想。在这篇作品里，描写了小环的不很健康的思想和作风，作者没有加以批判，却把这种思想和作风误解成反封建的思想和作风。这就是为什么这篇作品是不好的主要原因。
    作者处理动员参军的时候，小环被描写为关键人物。过分强调了她在参军运动中的作用，因而把农村参军运动中最主要的动力——党的领导，翻身农民的政治觉悟被十分轻率的忽略了。在翻身农民中也的确有些农民是希望结了婚再参军的，这也只是参军运动中的个别现象，而个别的现象却有时是和事物正常的本质有着很大的距离的，甚至是相违反的，作者既没有写出事物的正常的本质，却突出的描写了个别现象，因而所反映的现实是被歪曲了的。而反封建的领导者——支部却被推到从属的次要的地位。
    又如《改造》是写一个“小土瘪地主》被改造的故事。作者用了很多篇幅来描写这个地主是个废物，并且过份地追求趣味，却没有写出构成这个地主的生活基础——剥削。这样就把地主阶级在对农民阶级剥削中的残忍，阴险，狠毒的面貌给模糊了。因而也冲淡了地主阶级和农民阶级之间的对立关系。（这期发表了两篇对《改造》的批评，和一篇作者自己的检讨，可参看。）
    另外也还有些作品是没有什么意义或意义很少的。
    对这样的作品，虽然作者要负责任，但在本刊来说，编者是首先应该负责的。
    给本刊投稿的大部分是初学写作者，他们热情地希望我们给以创作上的帮助，我们是尽力做了，在本刊发表的作品，大部分是这些青年写作者写的。即或不用，也告诉他较详细的意见，还有许多读者，来信提出各种文艺上的问题，我们也尽量的给了解答。但是，如何针对这些初学写作者创作上存在的问题，有计划地刊登一些指导写作的文章，却还做得很差。
    产生以上缺点的原因，是我们政治思想水平不高，对业务的钻研还很不够。要改进我们的工作，必须加强政治的和文艺的理论学习，经常执行严格的自我批评，不断地改进业务，我们欢迎读者群众的批评与监督，只有在群众的批评与监督下，才能及时发现错误与缺点，及时改正错误与缺点，使这个刊物编得更好，在新中国的文艺建设中起它应有的作用。（转载《人民文学》二卷二期）
