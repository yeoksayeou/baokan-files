　　【Report from our newspaper in Gaocheng】Recently, an incident of village cadres obstructing freedom of marriage occurred in Shuixiang Village, Sixth District, Gaocheng County, Hebei Province. Due to the bureaucratic work style of the county People's Court and district government cadres, the woman was forced to wander outside for more than twenty days. Now, the county People's Government has instructed the county People's Court and the Sixth District Government to conduct strict self-criticism, and will give criticism or punishment to cadres who undermine the Marriage Law.
　　Sun Zhisuo, a liberated farmer in Shuixiang Village, Gaocheng, is twenty-seven years old and has a mutual affection for Zhao Xiaoyan, a nineteen-year-old working woman in the same village. Both parties were willing to marry. Last winter, they asked someone to propose marriage to the woman's parents. However, Zhao Xiaoyan's father, Zhao Luodian, disapproved because he disliked that the man's family was poor. In the first month of the lunar calendar this year, the man and woman, together with the matchmaker, went to the district government to register and request approval for marriage. Jia Ming, the secretary of the district government, believed that there was no matchmaker or village cadre to be the introducer, and refused to register, and excused himself that the district had no marriage certificate, and evaded the matter. When the woman returned home, she was beaten by her parents and locked in the house and not allowed to come out. Later, Zhao Xiaoyan escaped, found the man and the matchmaker, and asked the village head Qi Sangou to write a letter of introduction, and went to the district to register again, but the district government still did not give formal registration. Later, at the instigation of Sun Lujie, a village cadre, the woman's parents invited the village head Qi Sangou, the security officer Sun Zhengyue, etc. to a banquet, and threatened to beat the matchmaker, claiming that if Sun and Zhao married, they would gather people to fight. When the man Sun Zhisuo appealed to the district government again, the district government wrote a letter to the county People's Court about the matter. After inquiring, the county court issued a marriage certificate, but without a stamp, and wrote a letter to the district chief, asking him to handle it at his discretion. The district thought that the county was deliberately shirking responsibility, and did not seize the opportunity to solve the problem. Then, the woman's family locked Zhao Xiaoyan and asked militiamen to guard her. The village head Qi Sangou and others also attempted to find another partner for her. Zhao Xiaoyan heard the news and escaped in the rain, wandering outside for more than twenty days. The district government knew about this, but did not care.
　　On April 11, Zhang Qingshen and other cadres of the Gaocheng County Party Committee went to the village to work. When they learned about the matter, they conducted a detailed investigation with the district civil affairs assistant and educated the party members on the new Marriage Law. Through the village cadres, they opened up the minds of the woman's parents, obtained their consent, and scheduled the wedding for April 14. In order to promote the Marriage Law, it was also planned to invite nearby masses to participate. At this time, Sun Genbao, the nephew of Sun Lujie in the village (who worked in the county water conservancy promotion agency), heard about this and interfered without any reason. Together with Sun Lujie and others, he instigated Zhao Xiaoyan's brother to sue the county People's Court, falsely claiming that Sun Zhisuo had abducted his sister. Li Cede, the president of the county People's Court, did not investigate and study, but listened to one-sided statements and arrested Sun Zhisuo, who was about to hold a wedding, to the county. Later, although Sun Zhisuo was released due to criticism from the county leaders, Li Cede still had a strong feudal ideology and insisted that marriage should not be allowed without the consent of the woman's parents; he did not investigate the fact that the woman had been persecuted several times. Sun Genbao, a cadre of the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency, also traveled around for this matter, leaving his post and returning home five times, going to the district three times, and to the county twice, to prevent Sun and Zhao from getting married.
　　After learning about this matter, the county Women's Federation, led by Director Dong Jinye and others, conducted a detailed investigation and believed that the marriage of Sun Zhisuo and Zhao Xiaoyan was completely correct, and the masses also agreed. They submitted this situation to the county People's Government, the county People's Court, and the Sixth District Government, requesting that the marriage of Sun and Zhao be approved according to law.
　　Now, the county People's Government has ascertained the above facts, instructed the county People's Court and the Sixth District People's Government to correct the mistakes they have made, and requested the relevant cadres to make profound self-criticism; Li Cede, Jia Ming, Sun Genbao, Sun Lujie and other cadres who undermined the Marriage Law are being studied and given criticism or punishment according to the severity of the circumstances. The Gaocheng County Party Committee will also give criticism or punishment to the party members who obstructed the marriage of Sun Zhisuo and Zhao Xiaoyan.

　　藁城县人民法院院长等干部
    阻挠赵小烟婚姻自主   
    迫使女方在外流浪廿多天
    县府县委正研究处分办法
    【本报藁城讯】河北省藁城县六区水香村，最近发生了一件村干部等阻挠婚姻自主事件，由于县人民法院与区政府干部存在官僚主义作风，迫使女方在外流浪二十余天。现该县人民政府已指示县人民法院及六区区政府进行严格的检讨，并对破坏婚姻法的干部，分别予以批评或处分。
    藁城水香村翻身农民孙志锁，今年二十七岁，与同村十九岁的劳动妇女赵小烟情投意合，双方情愿结婚。去冬曾托人向女方家长说亲。但赵小烟的父亲赵洛典嫌男方家贫，不同意。今年旧历正月，男女双方偕同介绍人赴区政府登记，请求批准结婚。区政府秘书贾明认为没有村干部作介绍人，不予登记，并借口区里没有结婚证，推托了事。女方回家曾遭家长欧打，并被锁在屋里不许出来。后来赵小烟逃出来，找到男方与介绍人，并请村长齐三狗写了介绍信，再度到区登记，区政府仍未予正式登记。以后，在该村干部孙洛解的怂恿之下，女家家长邀请村长齐三狗、治安员孙正月等吃了酒席，并威胁欧打介绍人，声称如孙赵二人结婚，就要集众打架。男方孙志锁再向区政府申诉时，区政府将此事写信推到县人民法院。县法院问明后，发给了结婚证，但没有盖章，写信给区长，叫他酌情处理。区里认为是县里有意推托，也未抓紧解决。接着，女家将赵小烟锁禁请民兵看守。村长齐三狗等又企图为她另找对象。赵小烟闻讯冒雨逃出，在外流浪二十多天。区政府明知此事，亦不闻不问。
    四月十一日，藁城县委会干部张清深等到该村工作，闻知此事，即与区民政助理员进行了详细调查，并对党员进行了新婚姻法的教育，通过村干部打通了女方家长思想，征得他的同意，定四月十四日举行婚礼。为了宣传婚姻法，还拟邀集附近群众参加。这时，该村孙洛解的侄子孙根保（在县水利推进社工作）听说了此事，竟毫无理由地出来干涉，与孙洛解等共同鼓动赵小烟的哥哥向县人民法院起诉，诬称孙志锁拐走了他的妹妹。县人民法院院长李策德未加调查研究，偏听一面之词，把正将举行婚礼的孙志锁拘捕到县。后来，虽因县领导上的批评，将孙志锁放回，但李策德仍存有浓厚的封建思想，坚持女方家长不同意不得结婚；对女方数次受迫害的事实，则不加追究。水利推进社干部孙根保又为此事到处奔走，擅离职守回家五次、到区三次、到县两次，多方阻止孙赵二人的结婚。
    该县妇联闻知此事后，由主任董进业等作了详细调查，认为孙志锁与赵小烟的婚姻完全正确，群众也同意。即将此一情况提交县人民政府、县人民法院及六区区政府，要求依法批准孙赵二人的婚姻。
    现该县人民政府已查明上述事实，指示县人民法院及六区人民政府纠正所犯错误，并要求有关干部作深刻检讨；对破坏婚姻法的干部李策德、贾明、孙根保、孙洛解等，正研究按情节轻重，分别给以批评或处分。藁城县委对阻挠孙志锁、赵小烟婚姻的党员，也将分别予以批评或处分。
