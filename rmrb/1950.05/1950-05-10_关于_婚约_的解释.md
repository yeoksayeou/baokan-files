　　Explanation of "Engagement"
　　To the Editor: We do not quite understand the binding force of engagements. Please explain.
　　Zhang Zhong
　　Comrade Zhang Zhong: Generally speaking, an engagement is merely a pre-marital agreement, not a necessary procedure for establishing a marriage relationship. If one party is dissatisfied with the original engagement and unwilling to fulfill it, they can terminate it by notifying the other party and are not subject to any constraints. Therefore, dissolving an engagement is merely a declaration to abolish a pre-marital agreement where no marriage relationship existed originally; it is different from a divorce, which dissolves the status of a married couple where a marriage relationship already exists. The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, which has now been passed by the seventh meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, only includes provisions for marriage and divorce, and does not mention the issue of engagement, which is the reason why.

　　关于“婚约”的解释
    编辑同志：我们对婚约的约束力有些不了解，请你解答。
    张忠
    张忠同志：一般所谓婚约，它只是一种婚前的预约，而不是构成婚姻关系的必要手续。一方如对原来的婚约不满，不愿履行时，通知对方即可解除，并不受任何约束。因之，解除婚约只是对于原来并不存在婚姻关系的婚前预约宣告废除；它和离婚的原来存在着婚姻关系的夫妻身份的消灭是两回事。现经中央人民政府委员会第七次会议通过的中华人民共和国婚姻法只有结婚和离婚的规定，而没有提到婚约问题，也就是这个道理。
