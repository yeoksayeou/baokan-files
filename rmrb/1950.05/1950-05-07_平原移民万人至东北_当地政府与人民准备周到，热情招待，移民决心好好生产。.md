[Report from Northeast Daily] Following the reception of over ten thousand immigrants from Hebei Province last winter, the Northeast People's Government has received another ten thousand immigrants from Pingyuan Province this spring. In coordination with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government convened a meeting of Songjiang and Heilongjiang provinces in early March to discuss the work of receiving immigrants, assigning the task of settling five thousand people to each province. In mid-March, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Civil Affairs jointly dispatched nine cadres to Jinzhou, Shanhaiguan, Changchun, Jilin, Meihekou, Zhengjiatun and other places to prepare immigration reception stations. The immigrants from Pingyuan Province began arriving in the Northeast on March 24th. Thanks to the experience gained from receiving immigrants from Hebei Province last winter and the assistance of the railways, coupled with Pingyuan Province's prior thorough propaganda, education, and organization work for the immigrants, and the dedicated care of the escorting cadres, the work of transporting immigrants this year has been very smooth.

When the immigrants entered the Northeast, the masses at each reception station rushed to provide them with various forms of care. At Shanhaiguan Station, an immigrant who had been there before said: "In the past, under the rule of the enemy and puppets, when we came to this place, we would inevitably be beaten and scolded before being allowed to pass. Today, with the leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party, everything has changed. When we come here, people even give us hot water to drink. Everyone is like one big family." When distributing dry rations at Jinzhou Station, an old woman among the immigrants said: "We are taking the train to the Northeast to escape the famine, and not only are we not asked to pay for tickets, but we are also provided with food. The People's Government and the Communist Party really care about the poor." Other immigrants said: "The government not only provides dry rations but also pickles. They have thought of everything so thoroughly. If we don't work hard to produce, we will be letting the government down."

　　平原移民万人至东北
    当地政府与人民准备周到，热情招待，移民决心好好生产。
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：东北人民政府继去年冬季接收河北省移民万余人之后，今春又接收平原省移民一万人。东北人民政府农林部配合民政部于三月初即召开了松江、黑龙江两省接收移民工作会议，分配该两省各安置五千人的任务。三月中旬，由该区农林、民政两部协同派出干部九名，分赴锦州、山海关、长春、吉林、梅河口、郑家屯等地筹设移民招待站。平原省移民，于三月二十四日开始，即陆续到达东北境内。由于获得去冬接收河北省移民的经验和铁路方面的协助，加之平原省在事先对移民也都作了充分的宣传、教育和组织工作，护送干部又热心照顾，今年在运送移民工作上甚为顺利。
    当移民进入东北境后，各招待站的群众都争先恐后给移民以种种照顾。到山海关站时，有位曾经到过此地的移民说：过去敌伪统治时候，到这地方，说不定挨多少打骂，才能放过去，今天有了人民政府和共产党领导，什么都变过来了，我们来到这里还有人给送热水喝，大家真像一家人一样。在锦州车站发干粮时，移民中一位老太太谈着：坐火车到东北来逃荒，不叫出车票，还供给吃的，人民政府和共产党真是会关心穷人。还有的移民说：“公家不光给干粮，还发咸菜，想的太周到了，若不好好生产，就对不起公家。”
