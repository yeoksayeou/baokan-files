　　Attention, Binbin!
    The government protects the life and property safety of whistleblowers
    On April 27th, we received an anonymous letter stating, "Individual cadres in a certain local government are using their power to collude with private merchants... If you can guarantee the safety of my life and property, I am willing to provide you with the details," etc. It has been decreed by our government that cadres are not allowed to engage in private business. It is even more wrong for someone to use their power to collude with private merchants. We ask the anonymous informant (Binbin) to write to us, and this committee will be responsible for guaranteeing the safety of their life and property.

　　请斌斌君注意！
    政府保障检举人生命财产安全
    四月二十七日接一匿名信，内称“某地政府个别干部利用职权，勾结私商……，你们如能保障我的生命财产安全，我愿将详情贡献你们”等语。查我政府早有明令不准干部私人经商，今有人利用职权勾结私商，更属非是。请该密告人（斌斌）来信告诉我们，本委负责保障其生命财产之安全。
