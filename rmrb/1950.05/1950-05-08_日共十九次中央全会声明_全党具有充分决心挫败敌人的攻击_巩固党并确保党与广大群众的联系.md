Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 6th: A dispatch from Tokyo states that the 19th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued the following statement: The 19th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party has reached a consensus on the key points of resolving the party's strategic issues. The plenary session also thoroughly discussed internal party issues, and after conducting self-criticism in a spirit of comradeship, unanimously passed resolutions on combating sectarianists and elements causing confusion within the party, and on establishing democratic centralism and ensuring party unity.

Currently, domestic and foreign reactionaries are concentrating their attacks on the Japanese Communist Party. For example, during the Japanese House of Councillors election, they attempted to attack our party through false propaganda and oppressive means.

In light of these attacks, all party members, including all members of the Political Bureau led by General Secretary Tokuda Kyuichi, are fully determined to thwart the enemy's attacks, to counter them with ideological and organizational unity, to consolidate the party, and to ensure the party's connection with the broad masses. They are fully determined to unite with the people of the whole country to bravely fight for the complete independence of our country, against turning it into a military base, and against war.

　　日共十九次中央全会声明
    全党具有充分决心挫败敌人的攻击  巩固党并确保党与广大群众的联系
    【新华社讯】塔斯社上海六日电：据东京来讯称，日本共产党第十九次中央委员会全体会议曾发表如下声明：日本共产党第十九次中央委员会全体会议已就解决党的策略问题的各要点获得一致的意见。全体大会同时也曾透彻讨论党内的问题，而且在以同志的精神进行自我批评以后，已一致通过了关于对宗派主义者以及对造成党内混乱现象的分子进行斗争的决议，通过了关于建立民主集中制以及确保党的团结的决议。
    目前，国内外反动派正集中攻击日本共产党。例如，在进行日本议会参议院选举的时候，他们就想凭虚妄的宣传和压迫手段来打击我们的党。
    鉴于这种攻击，全体党员，包括以总书记德田球一为首的政治局全体委员在内，都具有充分决心来挫败敌人的攻击，以思想上与组织上的团结来对抗他们，巩固党并确保党与广大群众的联系。他们具有充分的决心，要与全国人民一致勇敢地为争取我国的完全独立、为反对将它变为军事基地并为反对战争而奋斗。
