　　The US Imperialists are Shocked by the Strength of the Japanese People's Power
    MacArthur Publicly States He Will Declare the Japanese Communist Party Illegal
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 5th] US occupation forces commander in Japan, MacArthur, issued a statement on April 29th to commemorate the so-called third anniversary of the new Japanese constitution, openly violating the Potsdam Declaration's provisions on encouraging democratic forces in Japan, and seeking to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal. According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo, MacArthur, in order to find a pretext for outlawing the Japanese Communist Party, the loyal defender of Japanese national independence and freedom, issued many malicious and baseless slanders against the Japanese Communist Party. MacArthur falsely claimed: "In Japan, as elsewhere, freedom (!) has been attacked by a very small minority (referring to the Japanese Communist Party)." MacArthur then openly declared: "The role played by the Japanese Communist Party immediately raises the question of whether it should continue to be given the rights, benefits, and protections of the country and laws it seeks to destroy, and will raise the suspicion of whether it should continue to be considered a legally organized political movement."
    MacArthur's statement demanding that the Japanese Communist Party be declared illegal immediately received a response from his loyal running dog, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida. Yoshida told a United Press reporter on the 2nd that MacArthur's "suggestion" regarding declaring the Japanese Communist Party illegal would have a huge impact on the Japanese government's thinking. He said he agreed with the views expressed by MacArthur. Other unnamed cabinet members of the Yoshida government admitted that the Yoshida government was preparing to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal. Japanese Prosecutor General Ueda Shun also stated that the Japanese "government is closely monitoring the activities of the Japanese Communist Party."
    MacArthur's plan to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal shows that the US imperialists are increasingly feeling the growth of the Japanese people's strength in the struggle for independence, peace, and democracy, and feeling the expansion of the Japanese Communist Party's power, and are therefore eager to take this nakedly fascist measure.

　　美帝震惊于日本人民力量的强大
    麦克阿瑟公然表示将宣布日共为非法
    【新华社五日讯】美国驻日占领军首脑麦克阿瑟在四月二十九日为纪念所谓日本新宪法三周年时发表声明，公然违背波茨坦宣言关于鼓励日本民主势力的规定，要宣布日本共产党为非法。据合众社东京消息：麦克阿瑟为了找寻取缔日本民族独立与自由的忠贞保卫者——日本共产党的借口，对日本共产党发出了许多恶毒而毫无根据的诬蔑。麦克阿瑟诬称：“在日本，正如在其他地方一样，自由（！）已受到很小的少数派（按指日本共产党）的袭击”。麦克阿瑟接着就公开宣布：“日本共产党所起的作用，立即引起一个问题，即是否再给它以受到它想予以破坏的国家与法律的利益和保护的权利，并将引起一种怀疑，即是否再认为它是合法地组织起来的政治运动。”
    麦克阿瑟要求宣布日共为非法的声明，立即获得其忠实走狗——日本首相吉田茂的响应。吉田于二日告合众社记者说：麦克阿瑟关于宣布日共为非法的“建议”，对日本政府的想法，将有巨大的影响。他说：他同意麦克阿瑟所表示的看法。吉田政府其他不敢透露姓名的阁员们承认，吉田政府已为宣布日共非法进行准备工作。日本检察总长植田俊并表示，日本“政府正严密地监视日共的活动”。
    麦克阿瑟之准备宣布日共非法的计划，显示了美帝国主义者正日益感觉到日本人民为独立、和平、民主而斗争的力量之增长，感觉到日本共产党力量的壮大，因而急于采取这种赤裸裸的法西斯手段。
