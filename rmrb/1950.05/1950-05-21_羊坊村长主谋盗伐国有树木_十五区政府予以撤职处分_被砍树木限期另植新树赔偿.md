    Fifteenth District Government Imposes Dismissal
    Stolen Trees to be Replanted and Compensated for within a Time Limit
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Wang Wenbin, the village chief of Sheepfold Village in the Fifteenth District of Beijing's suburbs, masterminded and colluded with 58 households in the village to steal more than 1,240 state-owned trees. The Fifteenth District Government has already dismissed him from his post and transferred him to the Beijing Municipal People's Court for legal punishment. Yi Hengmao, the director of the village's Farmers' Association, was also dismissed from his post by the Fifteenth District Farmers' Association for collaborating with Wang Wenbin to damage state property. Other accomplices among the cadres have been given criticism and education by the Fifteenth District Government. All felled trees must be returned within a time limit, and those who felled the trees are responsible for replanting new trees equal to the number felled, also within a time limit. In order to educate all cadres in the suburbs, the Municipal Government's Suburban Committee has circulated the facts of this case and the handling process to the governments of all districts and villages in the suburbs, and has called on all cadres to strictly protect forests and strengthen the publicity and education work on cherishing state-owned trees among the masses.
