　　Workers Love the People's Liberation Army
    On the 17th of this month, we were traveling to the city in a medium-sized truck on official business. When the truck reached the intersection of Taiping Bridge Street and Tunju HuTong on Beigouyan Street in the western city, it suddenly broke down. The driver repaired it for a long time, but couldn't fix it. Just as he was at a loss, students from the North China Electrical Engineering Bureau Workers' School passed by. When they saw that the People's Liberation Army's vehicle had broken down, they unhesitatingly volunteered to help with the repairs. Comrade Li Jingui, who was wearing the People's Hero Medal, was especially active. He carefully searched for the fault, sweating profusely and getting oil all over his hands. With the active help of Comrade Li Jingui and others, the car was finally repaired and successfully completed its mission, returning to headquarters. The spirit and actions of the worker comrades in loving the People's Liberation Army deeply moved us.

　　工人热爱解放军
    我们于本月十七日乘中卡车一辆因公进城。当卡车行至西城北沟沿太平桥街屯绢胡同口时，忽然发生故障。驾驶员修理很久，还是修不好。正在束手无策的时候，华北电器总局职工学校学员由此路过，他们看见解放军的汽车发生了故障，便毫不犹豫的自动参加修理，尤其以带有人民功臣奖章的李金贵同志更为积极。他细心寻找故障，累的满头是汗，双手是油。在李金贵等同志的积极帮助下，汽车终于修好而顺利的完成任务，返回本部。工人同志们这种热爱解放军的精神与行动使我们非常感动。
