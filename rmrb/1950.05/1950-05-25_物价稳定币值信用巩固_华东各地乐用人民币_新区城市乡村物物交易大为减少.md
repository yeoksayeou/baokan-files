　　With price stability and consolidated currency value,
    East China is happy to use RMB.
    Barter transactions in new urban and rural areas are greatly reduced.
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the unified financial and economic policy in East China, prices have become increasingly stable, and the credit of the RMB has been solidified. Transactions in cities are generally priced in RMB; farmers also begin to feel the unnecessary nature of barter trade and are happy to use currency. A large amount of RMB has penetrated the countryside.
    First, the "emphasize goods over currency" mentality of urban people has gradually changed. The phenomenon of rushing to buy physical goods has decreased, and general transactions are conducted with currency. In five cities in Southern Anhui, namely Wuhu, Tunxi, Xuancheng, Datong, and Dangtu, according to statistics on the prices of five major commodities—rice, oil, salt, yarn, and cloth—the average price decreased by one-third in the forty days after mid-March, thus further consolidating the credit of the RMB. Speculative hoarders have gradually disappeared, while retail transactions of daily necessities for the people have become much more active. In Laiyang City in the Jiaodong Bohai area, due to the scarcity of currency in the market, merchants who were eager to obtain funds would rather sell for less money than engage in barter, so the phenomenon of barter trade in the market has been greatly reduced.
    Second, the amount of currency that farmers bring to the countryside is increasing day by day. In the majority of towns in the Xuancheng and Chizhou regions, grain used to be the medium of exchange. General stores operated in grain as well, and farmers brought grain into the city to buy things, but this phenomenon has now basically disappeared. Two months ago, very few people in Guichi County were willing to use RMB with a face value of 100 yuan, but now even RMB with a face value of 50 yuan is appearing on the market. Farmers in Ningguo County are unwilling to use grain for trading when they enter the city, because this is not only difficult to calculate, but also easy to suffer losses when weighing in and out. Farmers selling vegetables in Xuancheng County now say they earn so much money instead of so much rice.
    The figures for the goods and native products purchased and sold by the Qingdao Trust Company on behalf of farmers in the province generally show that the amount of purchases has gradually decreased compared to the amount of sales since March. The amount decreased by 24,527,121 yuan in March compared to February, and by 35,052,500 yuan in April compared to March. This shows that the amount of currency brought by farmers to the countryside is gradually increasing. In addition, the Qingdao branch of the Shandong United Sales Office paid all cash for the 100,000 catties of raw oil received from the Bohai area in April.
    The large amount of currency recently invested by the state-owned China Tea Company's Tunxi branch in various counties in the Huizhou and Chizhou regions for the purchase of tea has mostly flowed into the countryside. The company invested 6 billion yuan of RMB in Qimen alone in the twelve days from April 25 to May 6, but the amount of currency recovered by local state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, People's Banks, and tax bureaus during the same period was only one-third of this amount; the remaining approximately 4 billion yuan of currency has been taken back to the countryside by tea farmers.
    Although Fujian Province has only been liberated for a short time, the amount of RMB going to the countryside is not small. Farmers in the four rural areas of Fuzhou enter the city to sell firewood and rice, etc., all priced in RMB, and merchants are also happy to use RMB. The circulation area of RMB in Xiamen has also expanded, and large transactions are all conducted through RMB. RMB is gradually circulating in Quanzhou, Yong'an, Longyan and other places. In Jian'ou, RMB can circulate everywhere except in remote rural areas. In Nanping, if the sales volume of local products can be increased, then currency can be massively distributed to the countryside. In addition, after farmers bring currency to the countryside, they are willing to save it.

### 物价稳定币值信用巩固  华东各地乐用人民币  新区城市乡村物物交易大为减少

　　物价稳定币值信用巩固
    华东各地乐用人民币
    新区城市乡村物物交易大为减少
    【本报讯】华东各地自财经统一后，物价日趋稳定，人民币信用巩固，城市交易一般都以人民币计价；农民也开始感觉物物交易的不必要，均乐于使用货币。大批人民币深入农村。
    第一、城市人民“重货轻币”心理逐渐改变。竞购实物现象减少，一般交易都用货币。皖南区芜湖、屯溪、宣城、大通、当涂等五个城市中，就米、油、盐、纱、布五种主要商品价格统计，自三月中旬以后四十天内，平均下降了三分之一，因而人民币信用益见巩固。投机囤积的批发商，已逐渐销声匿迹，人民日常生活必需品零售交易却大为活跃。胶东渤海地区莱阳城，因市场货币较少，急于用款之商贩，宁肯少卖钱，也不再以货易货，故市场物物交易现象已大见减少。
    第二、农民带往乡村的货币日渐增多。宣城、池州两专区多数市镇以往都是以粮食作为交换媒介，一般商店都同时经营粮食，农民也带着粮食进城买东西，而目前这种现象业已基本绝迹。贵池县两个月前很少有人愿意使用票额一百元的人民币，现在却连五十元票面的人民币也在市上出现了。宁国县农民进城已不愿再用粮食作买卖。因为这样不但不好计算，秤进秤出也容易吃亏。宣城县进城卖菜的农民现在也再不说挣多少米，而说挣多少钱了。
    青岛市信托公司代省内农民购销货物和土产的数字，一般的说，代购额比代销额从三月份起即逐渐减少。三月份较二月份减少二四、五二七、一二一元，四月份比三月份减少三五、○五二、五○○元。这说明了货币被农民带往乡村者逐渐增多。又山东合销处青岛分处，四月份收进渤海区去的十万斤生油全部付出了现款。
    国营中国茶叶公司屯溪分公司最近在徽州、池州专区各县为收购茶叶所投放的大批货币，绝大部分已经流入农村。该公司仅在祁门一地自四月二十五日到五月六日的十二天内即投放人民币六十亿元，但在同一时期内经当地各国营贸易公司、合作社、人民银行和税局等回笼的货币数只有该款的三分之一；其余四十亿元左右货币已被茶农带回农村。
    福建省解放时间虽短，但人民币下乡数目却并不少。福州四乡农民入城售柴米等物，均以人民币计价，商民亦乐于用人民币。厦门人民币的流通面积也已扩展，大宗交易均通过人民币。泉州、永安、龙岩等地人民币逐渐流通。建瓯除偏僻乡村外，人民币均能流通。南平如果土产销量能够增加，则货币当可大量下乡。此外，农民将货币带往乡村后，已愿意把它储存起来了。
