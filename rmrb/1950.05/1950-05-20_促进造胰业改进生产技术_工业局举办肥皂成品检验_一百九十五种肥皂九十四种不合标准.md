　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] To promote technological improvements and enhance product quality in the Beijing soap manufacturing industry, the Municipal Industry Bureau, in conjunction with the preparatory committee of the Soap Manufacturing Trade Association, initiated a city-wide soap product inspection in mid-April. This inspection has now concluded. On the 16th, a general meeting of factory owners in the industry was convened to introduce methods for producing high-quality soap and to establish a system whereby each factory self-identifies the grade of its products and commits to meeting the required specifications within a specific timeframe.

　　To advance the inspection effort, the trade association's preparatory committee first absorbed experienced technicians from various factories to form a Technical Improvement Committee. Following the standard specifications established last year, the committee selected five factories to trial-produce five different qualities of standard soap, commissioning the Industrial Experiment Institute to conduct qualitative analyses. Subsequently, based on the analysis results, the specifications were revised according to components such as total fatty matter, moisture, alcohol-insoluble matter, free alkali, and neutral fat. Simultaneously, the Technical Improvement Committee conducted a comprehensive survey of all soap factories in the city and collected samples. The survey materials clearly demonstrated that the soap manufacturing industry in Beijing generally suffered from rudimentary production equipment and poor technical conditions. Among the 165 factories, the average number of employees per factory was only 3.9, and 123 factories lacked specialized technicians altogether. Regarding manufacturing methods, 56% employed the simple "cold process," resulting in insufficient saponification of oils and alkalis, thereby diminishing the soap's utility. Consequently, based on the standard specifications, the grades of the city's existing 195 soap brands were evaluated, resulting in only one brand achieving the "Special Grade," 28 brands achieving "Grade A," 16 brands achieving "Grade B," 58 brands achieving "Grade C," and a staggering 94 brands classified as "Grade D" for being crudely manufactured and failing to meet the minimum standard specifications, accounting for 48% of the industry's products. To assist factories in effectively improving their techniques, the trade association's Technical Improvement Committee has compiled materials on raw material selection and inspection, manufacturing methods, and cost calculations for the four standard soap grades (Special, A, B, and C) into a booklet entitled "How to Make Good Soap," which has been distributed to all factories for reference. Furthermore, factories can also visit better-performing factories for on-site observation.

　　Through this product inspection, the factory owners have largely recognized that the People's Government is genuinely assisting factories in improving quality and developing business. Moving forward, they must ensure good quality and affordable prices to secure a promising future. Some factories have already begun making improvements. For example, after being rated as "Grade D," the Minxiang Factory immediately switched from the cold process to the hot process, significantly improving the soap's quality. Factories have also begun to shed their conservative mindset, with some factories producing higher-quality products removing their "No Visitors" signs and expressing willingness to openly share their techniques and engage in joint learning and research with other factories.

　　一百九十五种肥皂九十四种不合标准
    【京市新闻处讯】为促进京市造胰业改善生产技术、提高产品质量，市工业局于四月中旬开始领导造胰业同业公会筹委会举办了全市肥皂成品检验，现已告一段落，特于十六日召集该业厂主大会，介绍制造好肥皂的方法，规定各厂自己认做产品等级，在一定期限内达到应有规格。
    该业公会筹委会为推进检验工作，首先吸收各厂有经验的技师组织了技术改进委员会，依去年规定的标准规格挑选五个工厂试做五种品质不同的标准肥皂，委托工业试验所作定性分析，然后根据分析结果，重新按照纯皂量、水分、酒精不溶物、游离碱、中性脂肪等成分修订规格。同时技术改进委员会将全市肥皂工厂作了普遍调查与征集样品。从调查材料中明显看出本市造胰业普遍生产设备简陋、技术条件低劣。在一百六十五家工厂中，平均每家只有职工三点九人，有一百二十三家连专门技师都没有，制造方法上有百分之五十六采用简单的“冷制”，油和碱的皂化程度不够，使用价值不大。因此按标准规格把全市现有一百九十五种牌子的肥皂评定等级的结果，特等只有一种，甲等二十八种，乙等十六种，丙等五十八种，粗制滥造不合乎最低标准规格的丁等最多，达九十四种，占全业产品百分之四十八。该业公会技术改进委员会为帮助各厂切实改进技术，已搜集特、甲、乙、丙四种标准肥皂的原料选择检定、制造方法、成本计算等材料汇编成“怎样做好肥皂”小册，分发给各厂参考，各厂还可到产品较好的工厂实地观摩。
    通过这次成品检验，各厂厂主多已认识到人民政府确是认真地在帮助各工厂提高品质，发展业务，今后必须做到货好价廉，才有前途。有些工厂已开始改进，民享工厂被评为丁等后，就立即由冷制改为热制，品质大为提高。各厂并初步打破保守思想，有些产品质量较好的工厂已经把厂房“谢绝参观”的牌子摘下，愿公开技术，与各厂间共同学习、研究。
