　　The Evil Consequences of the U.S.-Japan Reactionary Rule
　　More Than 8 Million Unemployed in Japan
　　Workers' Actual Income Reduced by Three-Quarters
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 15th] The rule of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries has resulted in massive unemployment among the Japanese working people and the bankruptcy of large numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises. According to a Reuters Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Ministry of Labor released a report on April 29th entitled "Analysis of the Labor Economy in 1949." The report, in its greatly understated figures, admits that as of December 1949, Japan's unemployed population (including partially unemployed workers working less than 35 hours per week) reached 8,610,000. Due to the closure and staff reduction of some enterprises, union membership decreased by 400,000 between June and December 1949. The report admits that the so-called "labor economy rationalization" policy accelerated by the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board "was achieved only at the expense of the workers." Based on a comparison of purchasing power between last year and previous years, Japanese workers' income actually decreased to 75.2 percent.
    According to another recent survey by the Japanese Ministry of Labor, in the eleven months leading up to the end of February this year, 6,799 small Japanese enterprises employing less than 200 workers went bankrupt or reduced production. This resulted in the unemployment of as many as 343,000 workers. The Japanese Ministry of Labor frankly admitted that the reason for the massive unemployment of the Japanese working people and the large-scale bankruptcy of small enterprises is that the Yoshida government implemented the "austerity plan" formulated by Dodge, a Detroit banker and agent of the American monopoly capitalist groups, to serve the U.S.-Japan monopoly capitalist groups. The Ministry of Labor stated that since the implementation of Dodge's "austerity plan" last April, the reduction in small businesses has increased significantly.

　　美日反动派统治的恶果
　　日失业者八百余万
　　工人实际收入降低了四分之三
    【新华社十五日讯】美、日反动派的统治，造成了日本劳动人民的大量失业及中小企业的大批倒闭。综合路透社东京讯：日本劳工省四月二十九日发表一篇题为“一九四九年劳工经济的分析”的报告。该报告在其大大缩小了的数字中承认：到一九四九年十二月为止，日本的失业人口（包括每周工作不到三十五小时的部分失业工人在内），达八百六十一万名。由于若干企业的停闭及裁员等原因，在一九四九年六月至十二月间，工会会员减少了四十万人。该报告承认：日本经济安定本部加速推行的所谓“劳工经济合理化”的政策，“只是靠着牺牲工人”来获致的。根据去年的购买力与前几年的比较，日本工人的收入实际上降低到百分之七十五点二。
    据日本劳工省最近的另一项调查，迄今年二月底为止的十一个月中，雇用工人二百人以下的日本小企业，其中有六千七百九十九家破产或减工。因而失业的工人达三十四万三千名之多。日本劳工省坦白承认造成日本劳动人民大批失业和小企业大量倒闭的原因，是由于吉田政府执行美国垄断资本集团的代理人、底特律银行家道奇所制订的为美日垄断资本集团服务的“节约方案”。劳工省称：自去年四月道奇“节约方案”实施以来，小企业的减少有显著的增加。
