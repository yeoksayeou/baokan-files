　　A Shameful Trip
    A rat crossing the street, everyone shouts "Kill it!"
    --Proverb
    A merchant who peddles war
    Whose name is Acheson
    Leaves America for Europe
    To conduct a shameful conspiracy

　　Acheson arrived in Paris
    Men, women, old and young, all sigh
    As if a plague had arrived
    As if the Black Death had been discovered

　　The business Acheson conducts
    Is truly vile and shameless
    Taking people's lives as bets
    To extract profit from a sea of blood

　　Everyone detests Acheson
    Street corners are plastered with slogans:
    "We don't want to see you!"
    "War peddler, get out!"

　　Acheson arrived in London
    The British people are also unhappy
    Some women holding infants
    Go to the American Embassy to send letters

　　Thousands upon thousands of mothers
    Wrote thousands upon thousands of letters
    The letters expressed one will:
    "What we want is peace!"

　　Some women held up placards
    Some women unfurled banners
    "Ban the atomic bomb!"
    "Our children do not want to be sent to their deaths!"

　　Whether in Paris or London
    Acheson does not dare go out
    Hiding in his hole like a poisonous snake
    And will also slip away like a rat

　　An indecorous visit!
    A shameful trip!
    Those who peddle disaster are hated by all,
    Those who promote war are unwelcome everywhere.

### 可耻的旅行

　　可耻的旅行
    老鼠过街，人人喊打！
    ——民谚
    贩卖战争的商人
    名字叫做艾奇逊
    离开美国到欧洲
    进行可耻的阴谋
　
    艾奇逊到了巴黎
    男女老少都叹气
    好像是瘟疫来临
    好像发现黑死病
　
    艾奇逊做的买卖
    真是又下流又无耻
    拿人的性命当赌注
    从血海里捞取利润
　
    人人讨厌艾奇逊
    街头巷尾贴着标语：
    “我们不要看见你！”
    “战争贩子滚回去！”
　
    艾奇逊到了伦敦
    英国人民也不高兴
    有的妇女抱着婴孩
    到美国大使馆去送信
　
    千千万万的母亲
    写了千千万万封信
    信上表达一个意志：
    “我们要的是和平！”
　
    有的妇女举着标语牌
    有的妇女拉开旗子
    “禁止原子弹！”
    “我们的孩子不愿送死！”
　
    不论在巴黎还是伦敦
    艾奇逊都不敢出门
    像毒蛇一样躲在洞里
    也将像耗子一样溜走
　
    不体面的访问！
    可耻的旅行呵！
    贩卖灾难的人人憎恨，
    宣传战争的处处不欢迎。
