Xiao Fen and Xiao Gui
Xin Daming Shen Pengnian

Editor's Note: This is a very good poem, originally published in the first volume, third issue of "Mass Poetry" on March 1, 1950. The author uses relatively simple language and vivid techniques, utilizing the five-character poem form to narrate the story of two young League member female workers participating in a production blitz. Because "Mass Poetry" does not have many readers, we are specially introducing this poem to everyone on the May Fourth Youth Day. Comrade Ai Qing introduced it in his article "Talking about Worker Poetry" in the first issue of the second volume of "People's Literature," which readers can refer to.

　　A pair of green bamboo chopsticks,
　　Precisely are two sticks,
　　Xiao Fen and Xiao Gui,
　　Closer even than these.
　　They wear the same clothes,
　　Share food and drink alike.
　　Go to work together,
　　And confide in each other after work.
　　Their skills are equally good,
　　Their techniques are equally refined,
　　Youth League members,
　　Their thoughts are equally new.
　　Together they watch the spinning frame,
　　Working with great spirit,
　　All are shock workers,
　　Never separated for a moment.
　　The deepest water has a bottom,
　　The tallest mountain has roots.
　　Why are they so close?
　　Listen, I'll tell you the reason:
　　Their homes are close,
　　Their interactions are naturally intimate.
　　Xiao Fen is a year older,
　　They address each other as sisters.
　　Speaking of Xiao Gui's father,
　　He worked as a porter at the station,
　　The Japanese devils arrested him,
　　And he never returned.
　　Speaking of Xiao Fen's father,
　　The puppet army conscripted him,
　　He disappeared without a trace,
　　His fate unknown.
　　Both families suffered hunger,
　　Went to the textile factory to work,
　　Became apprentices together,
　　Endured hardship together.
　　They were often scolded by the master,
　　Often beaten by the Japanese devils,
　　Always felt suffocated,
　　Forming a big knot in their hearts.
　　In nineteen forty-five,
　　The Japanese devils left,
　　A wolf departed,
　　And a dog arrived.
　　Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries,
　　Treated people cruelly,
　　Worked you to the bone,
　　And didn't pay your wages at the end of the month!
　　Xiao Gui came up with an idea,
　　And told Xiao Fen:
　　Let's work slowly for him,
　　Fight cruelty with cruelty.
　　The Communist Party arrived,
　　Workers saw their kinsfolk.
　　Working for ourselves,
　　Everyone is full of energy.
　　Organize shock workers,
　　To complete the task,
　　Not only not to fall behind ourselves,
　　But also to help others.
　　Xiao Fen and Xiao Gui,
　　Eagerly signed up.
　　The silver whistle sounds,
　　The red flag waves,
　　Twenty shock workers,
　　All have arrived.
　　A spinning frame,
　　All the spindles are empty,
　　Threading the yarn,
　　Takes only three minutes.
　　Everyone applauds,
　　It was reported in the worker's newspaper!
　　The shock team members,
　　Each is a hero!
　　Yellow satin, red silk thread,
　　The character "Shock" embroidered on it,
　　When the shock workers wear it,
　　Everyone is envious!
　　The workers' morale is high,
　　Everyone wants to emulate them,
　　The second shock team,
　　Has already been organized.
　　The second team started,
　　But don't know the rules,
　　They want the first team,
　　To send someone to guide them.
　　The first team is united,
　　They work really happily,
　　No one wants to be sent,
　　Making the administrator anxious.
　　This administrator,
　　Didn't know what to do,
　　Xiao Gui and Xiao Fen,
　　Have to draw one to go.
　　Said they were going to transfer Xiao Fen,
　　Xiao Fen got anxious:
　　"Is it that I'm not doing well?
　　You can make suggestions!
　　I'm willing to accept criticism,
　　I'm very willing.
　　If you transfer me arbitrarily,
　　I won't agree!"
　　Said they were going to transfer Xiao Gui,
　　Xiao Gui shook her head,
　　Before she could speak,
　　Tears welled up in her eyes.
　　"What crime did I, this shock worker,
　　Commit?
　　If you transfer me for no reason,
　　It's really unfair."
　　The administrator is really strange,
　　Neither hurried nor slow,
　　And explained the reason:
　　"Xiao Gui and Xiao Fen,
　　Are two small 'sects,'
　　The work needs people,
　　Why can't you understand?
　　You are Youth League members,
　　And haggle over work,
　　Not for the good of the whole factory,
　　But only care about yourselves!
　　The second team needs guidance,
　　You two are good in every way,
　　One of you should go,
　　The reasoning is clear.
　　Xiao Gui and Xiao Fen,
　　One of you must be transferred,
　　You discuss it well,
　　And see who is willing?"
　　A cloud in the sky,
　　Two people were moved,
　　Without speaking or smiling,
　　Thinking about things in their hearts!

　　Xiao Fen thought:
　　Xiao Gui is my younger sister,
　　If I don't let her have her way,
　　It would seem unfair as an elder sister!
　　No matter which team it is,
　　They are all shock teams.
　　All for working,
　　Why make a fuss?

　　Xiao Gui thought:
　　Xiao Fen is my older sister,
　　She helped me before,
　　I can't thank her enough.
　　I'll go find the administrator,
　　And tell him to transfer me!
　　Going to see the administrator,
　　Xiao Fen was talking,
　　The two faced each other,
　　Both were shy.
　　The administrator saw them,
　　And laughed aside:
　　"Your intentions,
　　I know them all,
　　You've turned the corner,
　　And untied the knot.
　　If sisters are like this,
　　The whole factory will surely do well,
　　Competing when necessary,
　　And yielding completely when necessary.
　　I have an idea,
　　I don't know if it's good or not?
　　Today Xiao Gui goes,
　　Tomorrow it's Xiao Fen's turn,
　　Switching people every day,
　　Do you think that's okay?"
　　The two nodded their heads,
　　Apologized to each other,
　　Their faces turned red,
　　And smiled at each other.

　　小芬和小桂
    辛大明　沈彭年
    编者按：这是一首很好的诗，原载于一九五○年三月一日出版的《大众诗歌》第一卷第三期上。作者采用了比较通俗的文字和比较生动的手法，利用五言诗的形式，叙述两个青年团员的女工参加生产突击的故事。因《大众诗歌》读者不多，我们特在五四青年节将这首诗介绍给大家。艾青同志在《人民文学》第二卷第一期《谈工人诗歌》一文中曾加以介绍，读者可以参看。
    一双绿竹筷，
    整整是两根，
    小芬和小桂，
    比这还要亲。
    穿衣穿一样，
    吃喝都不分。
    上工一道上，
    下工就谈心。
    手艺一般好，
    技术一样精，
    青年团团员，
    思想一样新。
    同看细纱车，
    干活好精神，
    全是突击手，
    时刻不离分。
    水深总有底，
    山高总有根。
    为啥这末亲？
    听我讲原因：
    两家住的近，
    来往本来亲。
    小芬大一岁，
    姐妹来相称。
    提起小桂爹，
    车站当脚行，
    鬼子抓了走，
    一去没下场。
    再说小芬爹，
    伪军抓壮丁，
    一去无音信，
    不知死与生。
    两家挨饥饿，
    纱厂去干活，
    一块当学徒，
    一块受折磨。
    常受师父骂，
    常挨鬼子打，
    心里常憋气，
    结成大疙疸。
    一九四五年，
    日本鬼子走，
    走了一条狼，
    来了一条狗。
    蒋匪反动派，
    待人好狠心，
    累折你的筋，
    到月不发薪！
    小桂出主意，
    告诉了小芬：
    给他磨洋工，
    狠心对狠心。
    来了共产党，
    工人见亲人。
    干活为自己，
    全都长精神。
    组织突击手，
    任务要完成，
    自己不落后，
    还要帮别人。
    小芬和小桂，
    争先报了名。
    银笛响一声，
    红旗摇一摇，
    二十个突击手，
    个个都来到。
    一台细纱车，
    全车锭子空，
    穿纱带上线，
    只要三分钟。
    人人都叫好，
    上了工人报！
    突击队员们，
    个个是英豪！
    黄缎红丝线，
    “突”字绣上边，
    突击手戴上，
    人人眼睛馋！
    工人情绪高，
    都要来仿效，
    突击第二队，
    已经组织好。
    二队开始搞，
    规矩摸不着，
    他们要一队，
    拨人去指导。
    一队结成团，
    干活真叫欢，
    拨谁谁不愿，
    急了管理员。
    这个管理员，
    不知甚主意，
    小桂和小芬，
    要抽一个去。
    说要调小芬，
    小芬着了急：
    “是我干不好？
    意见可以提！
    有错受批评，
    我也很愿意。
    随便把我调，
    我可不同意！”
    说要调小桂，
    小桂把头摇，
    话还没出口，
    两眼把泪掉。
    “我这突击手，
    犯了什么罪？
    无故把我调，
    实在太不对。”
    管理员真怪，
    不紧也不慢，
    道理讲起来：
    “小桂和小芬，
    两个小‘宗派’，
    工作需要人，
    为甚想不开？
    青年团团员，
    工作讲价钱，
    不为全厂好，
    只顾鼻子尖！
    二队要指导，
    你俩样样好，
    应该去一个，
    道理多明了。
    小桂和小芬，
    要调一个去，
    你们商量好，
    看看谁愿意？”
    天上一块云，
    二人动了心，
    没说也没笑，
    心里想事情！
　
    小芬心里想：
    小桂是妹妹，
    有事不让她，
    显着姐不对！
    管它是那组，
    全是突击队。
    全都为干活，
    何必要做对？
　
    小桂心里想：
    小芬是姐姐，
    从前帮助我，
    好处没法谢。
    去找管理员，
    要调就调我！
    去见管理员，
    小芬在谈话，
    两人对了面，
    全都羞答答。
    管理员见了，
    一旁笑哈哈：
    “你们的心意，
    我全知道了，
    弯弯转通了，
    疙疸解开了。
    姐妹都这样，
    全厂准搞好，
    争就都要争，
    让又全让了。
    我有个主意，
    不知好不好？
    今天小桂去，
    明天轮小芬，
    一天一换人，
    你看行不行？”
    俩人把头点，
    互相把歉道，
    脸儿红一红，
    互相笑一笑。
