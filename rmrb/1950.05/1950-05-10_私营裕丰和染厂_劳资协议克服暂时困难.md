【Beijing News Agency Dispatch】Private Yufeng and Dyeing Factory in Beijing is in a state of semi-shutdown due to the current reduction in the amount of cloth being dyed and a relative surplus of labor. Through labor-management negotiation, some workers have returned to their hometowns to engage in agricultural production to overcome the factory's temporary operational difficulties. There are eight machine dyeing factories in this city, all of which process and dye cloth. According to current market needs, production capacity had originally reached saturation. Since prices stabilized, goods have been slow to sell, and the amount of cloth dyed by private cloth shops and state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies has sharply decreased, resulting in a situation where each dyeing factory has too many workers and not enough work. Yufeng and Dyeing Factory has 47 employees and needs to dye 4,000 to 5,000 bolts of cloth per month to cover expenses, but in March and April, they only had 1,611 bolts of work. As a result, business was sluggish and the capitalists suffered losses. Many of the factory's workers are of peasant origin and have the technical skills to switch to agricultural production. Therefore, when labor and management recently discussed ways to overcome difficulties, the workers, in order to maintain production and reduce expenses, agreed with the capitalists to allow some workers from the dyeing vat, boiler, and dryer departments to return to their hometowns to farm. The factory paid for the return trip, retained their positions, and paid 30% of their wages. If business improves and the amount of cloth to be dyed in the market increases in two or three months, they can return to the factory to work. If the amount of cloth to be dyed does not increase, they can be replaced by workers remaining in the factory. As of now, 19 workers have left the factory to return to their hometowns.

　　劳资协议克服暂时困难
    【京市新闻处讯】京市私营裕丰和染厂因目前染布量减少，劳动力相对过剩，陷于半停工状态，经劳资协议，已有一部工人回乡从事农业生产，以渡过该厂经营上的暂时困难。本市机器染业共有八家工厂，都是承做加工染布，根据目前市场需要，生产能力原来已达饱和，自物价平稳后，商品滞销，私营布店和公营花纱布公司染布数量锐减，各染厂遂形成人多活少状态。裕丰和染厂有职工四十七人，每月需染四、五千匹布才够开支，但三、四两月只有一千六百十一匹的活，因之业务清淡，资方亏累。该厂工人多为农民出身，有转向农业的技术条件，所以最近劳资双方商讨渡过困难的办法时，工人为维持生产减少开支，与资方协议结果，同意抽出染槽、锅炉、干燥机等部门一部工人回乡种地。回乡的路费由资方付给，保留职务，发三成工资，两、三个月以后如果业务好转市场染布量增加，可以再行回厂工作，染布量不能增加时可以和留厂工人调换。截至目前止，该厂已有十九人离厂回乡。
