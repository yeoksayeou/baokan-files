Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, May 15th: The Third Wuhan Municipal People's Representative Conference, lasting six days, concluded on the 7th of this month. The conference focused on discussing methods to adjust the relationship between public and private enterprises in order to overcome the current temporary difficulties of industry and commerce. Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, attended and delivered a speech.

After listening to and passing Mayor Wu Defeng's report on the Wuhan Municipal People's Government's ten-month work summary and the work guidelines and tasks for 1950, the conference concentrated on reviewing and discussing the improvement of the existing relationship between public and private enterprises in Wuhan. Representatives from all sectors unanimously agreed that the Central South Military and Political Committee and the Municipal People's Government, by correctly implementing the Central People's Government's decision on unified financial and economic work, had stabilized prices and ensured the people's livelihood, while also paving the way for the development of legitimate industry and commerce. However, there were still serious inconsistencies between public and private enterprises, failing to effectively guide private industrial and commercial enterprises, which were facing difficulties due to various objective and subjective reasons, towards improvement. Some members of the industrial and commercial community, due to a lack of clear understanding of the People's Government's policy of unified financial and economic work, held a negative wait-and-see attitude, which was also one of the reasons for the current temporary difficulties. The conference also discussed this issue. Representatives from all sectors expressed that they should unite and work together to overcome abnormal phenomena in public-private and labor-capital relations in order to overcome temporary difficulties. Mayor Wu Defeng and representatives of public enterprises sincerely pointed out that in the past, the Hankou branch of the People's Bank and public enterprises had focused on providing loans and processing orders for private enterprises such as textiles and flour, assisting in the recovery and development of private enterprises. However, the connection between public enterprises and private enterprises in the past was insufficient, and some deviations occurred in the implementation of the policy of "considering both public and private interests." In the future, it is necessary to unite the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen to overcome difficulties and develop production. Representatives of the industrial and commercial community also criticized the "wait-and-see" mentality of some industrialists and businessmen, and expressed their determination to change the old management methods, do their best to maintain and restore production, and strive for the early arrival of a bright future. Worker representatives cited typical examples of workers in private enterprises voluntarily reducing wages and improving labor efficiency, and guaranteed that they would continue to promote a spirit of hard work and voluntarily unite with capitalists to overcome difficulties together in the future. After repeated discussions, representatives from all sectors unanimously recognized that as long as industrial and commercial and public-private relations are reasonably adjusted, and capitalists and workers do their best and work together, the temporary difficulties of industry and commerce can be overcome. Mayor Wu Defeng finally summarized everyone's opinions and decided that the government should strengthen the management of the market and the leadership of private enterprises, and expand the number of loans and processing according to specific circumstances, and adopt the method of regional, categorized, and joint purchase and sales to enable public and private enterprises to reasonably divide their work, achieve public-private cooperation and mutual benefit.

In addition, the conference also approved the Wuhan Municipal 1950 fiscal budget, as well as resolutions and implementation plans such as the establishment of labor-capital consultation meetings in private enterprises, temporary emergency relief for unemployed workers, the establishment of a labor model movement promotion committee, the abolition of the feudal monopoly system in the transportation industry, and the establishment of transportation companies, and suggested that the Municipal People's Government adopt and implement them.

Before the closing of the conference, Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, came to the meeting and gave a report on the current situation and the bright future of building a new Wuhan. Vice Chairman Deng first explained that the subjective and objective favorable conditions for building a new Wuhan have begun to be available, but there are still temporary and great difficulties. Vice Chairman Deng then deeply analyzed the basic roots of the difficulties, and pointed out that the current way to overcome the difficulties should start with stabilizing prices, adjusting public-private relations, and further improving labor-capital relations.

　　武汉召开三届人民代表会议
　  讨论调整公私企业关系克服暂时困难
    【新华社汉口十五日电】武汉市第三次各界人民代表大会历时六天，已于本月七日闭幕。会议着重讨论了调整公私企业关系的办法，以克服目前工商业的暂时困难。中南军政委员会邓子恢副主席曾出席讲话。
    会议在听取并通过了吴德峰市长关于武汉市人民政府十个月的工作总结及一九五○年工作方针任务的报告后，即集中检讨和讨论了改善武汉市现存的公私企业的关系。各界代表们一致认为：中南军政委员会和市人民政府，由于正确执行了中央人民政府统一财经工作的决定，平稳了物价，使人民生活得到了保障，同时，也替正当的工商业的发展开辟了道路。但是，公私营企业还存在着严重的不协调现象，未能很好地使那些因各种客观的和主观的原因而陷于困难的私营工商业走上好转的道路。部分工商界人士由于对人民政府统一财经工作的政策认识不清，抱着“看看再说”的消极等待态度，也是造成目前的暂时困难的原因之一。会议又针对这一问题进行了讨论。各界代表均表示应团结一致，协力克服公私关系和劳资关系上的不正常的现象，以渡过暂时困难。吴德峰市长和公营企业代表首先诚恳地指出：过去人民银行汉口分行及公营企业对私营企业如纺织、面粉等业曾有重点地进行了贷款和加工定货，协助了私业企业的恢复和发展，但公营企业过去和私营企业联系不够，在执行“公私兼顾”的政策上产生了若干偏向。今后一定要团结广大工商业家克服困难，发展生产。工商界代表也批判了某些工商业家的“看看再说”的消极思想，并表示决定改变旧一套的经营方法，尽力维持和恢复生产，争取光明前途的早日到来。工人代表则列举私营企业工人主动减薪、提高劳动效率的典型事例，并保证今后将继续发扬艰苦作风，主动团结资方共同渡过困难。经过反复讨论后，各界代表一致认识到：只要合理调整工商业和公私关系，资方与工人各尽所能，共同协力，工商业的暂时困难，是可以克服的。吴德峰市长最后综合大家意见，决定政府要加强对市场的管理和对私营企业的领导，并根据具体情况，扩大贷款和加工数量，采取分区、分类、联购联销的办法，使公私营企业合理分工，达到公私合作和两利的目的。
    此外，会议还通过了武汉市一九五○年度的财政概算，以及在私营企业中成立劳资协商会议、临时紧急救济失业工人、成立劳动模范运动推进委员会、废除搬运事业中封建把持制度和设立搬运公司的实施计划等决议案，建议市人民政府采纳执行。
    会议闭幕前，中南军政委员会邓子恢副主席莅会作了关于目前形势与建设新武汉的光明前途的报告。邓副主席首先说明建设新武汉的主观、客观各项有利条件已开始具备，但目前还存在着暂时的和很大的困难。邓副主席继而深刻地分析了困难的基本根源，并指出目前克服困难的办法应从稳定物价、调整公私关系和进一步改善劳资关系着手。
