　　Hope Beijing Establishes Blackboards
    Many cultural and educational centers in the Northeast have set up blackboards in major transportation hubs, which are viewed by many people. It is hoped that cultural and educational centers and libraries in Beijing will also set up blackboards at Qianmen or major transportation hubs, publishing news from various newspapers and news agencies, as well as cartoons, which will certainly have a great propaganda effect.

　　希望北京市建立黑板报
    东北各文化教育馆多在交通要道设立黑板报，看的人很多。希望京市各文化教育馆和图书馆也在前门或交通要道设立黑板报，刊载各报纸、通讯社要闻及漫画等，宣传效力一定很大。
