　　The Youth League Has Developed Rapidly in the Past Year
　　Membership Reaches 1.7 Million
　　Plays a Significant Role in Various Tasks
　　[Report from this newspaper] Under the leadership and with the help of the Chinese Communist Party, the China New Democratic Youth League has achieved brilliant successes in the past year. The organization of the Youth League has greatly developed. According to statistics from February of this year, the number of members has reached 1,708,129. With the development of the League's organization, the League's significant role in the various practical tasks called for by the Party and the People's Government is becoming increasingly prominent.
　　
　　Thousands of New Record Creators Emerge Among League Members in Factories, Mines, and Enterprises
　　All the work of the Youth League in factories, mines, and enterprises revolves around the general task of restoring and developing industrial production. For example, Youth League members in railway factories or locomotive depots in Mudanjiang, Shenyang, Jinzhou, Xuzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Kaifeng, and other places have united the broad masses of young workers and adult workers, using their spare time to repair locomotives, and have been repeatedly commended. On the one hand, Youth League members have demonstrated a high degree of conscious labor attitude, actively producing, saving raw materials, taking care of machines, or voluntarily increasing working hours to carry out voluntary labor; on the other hand, they have actively studied technology, improved tools and production methods, and emerged as thousands of new record creators, playing a pioneering role in the new record creation movement. The deeds of Zhao Guoyou, a Youth League member of the Shenyang Machine Tool Factory No. 3, are a typical example. In July last year, the factory called for the creation of new records, and the Youth League branch took the lead in responding, proposing inventions, creations, tool improvements, and improvements in working methods. Under this call, League member Zhao Guoyou successfully transformed tools, creating a record of machining a pulley in two minutes and twenty seconds (the original estimated time was sixteen hours). Subsequently, he invented the "turning and milling combination" operation method, creating a record of one minute and sixteen and a half seconds, and finally shortening it to only fifty minutes. Due to Zhao Guoyou's leading action, all the workers in the factory were involved in the new record creation movement. Following this, Tong Junshan, a Youth League member of the Machine Tool Factory No. 5, created a record of machining a pulley in thirty-seven minutes. Zhao Guoyou's Stakhanovite heroic deeds spread throughout Northeast China. Under the call of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, a mass movement to create new records in the industrial construction of New China was launched in various factories and mines. Youth League members in various places have become a leading force in this movement. According to extremely incomplete statistics: In Shenyang City, in the two months of November and December last year, more than 1,100 of the more than 6,000 young workers who were League members created new records. In Jilin City, 225 League members created 230 new records in one and a half months. In Andong City, by the end of November last year, 208 League members in 14 factories and enterprises had created new records. Up to now, League members in some cities in North China and East China have also created new records. This demonstrates the noble qualities of Youth League members in daring to respond to the call of the People's Government and the Party and being good at accepting new things. However, young people generally have relatively low technical levels, so the Youth League has paid attention to conducting extensive cultural and technical education among League members and young workers, mobilizing League members to actively participate in various cultural and technical training classes run by the administration and trade unions, and playing a backbone role in various training classes. Under the leadership of the Party, administrative support, and trade union assistance, the Youth League in many areas has launched a movement to respect teachers and love apprentices, uniting veteran workers and widely promoting the method of signing master-apprentice contracts to quickly and effectively improve the technical level of young workers. In addition, some female Youth League members, with the help of various parties, have participated in heavy industrial construction. Liang Jun, China's first female tractor driver, Tian Guiying, Bi Guiying, Wang Baohong, the first female train drivers, and Qi Guizhi, an 18-year-old female lathe worker, are all outstanding Youth League members.

　　Rural League Members Respond to Government Calls, Lead Production, and Actively Assist in Disaster Relief
　　In rural areas, many Youth League members actively respond to the calls of the People's Government and the Party, playing a leading role in planting more grain, cotton, peanuts, and other crops, organizing mutual aid labor teams, planting trees and forests, and improving and advancing farming methods. On the one hand, they conduct in-depth propaganda work; on the other hand, they use their exemplary actions to eliminate the conservative ideas of some farmers that "generations have never done this before." Youth League members in rural areas in Hebei and other places guarantee to complete their cotton planting tasks and persuade their parents and neighbors, leading some of the masses to plant cotton, playing a significant role in completing the government's cotton planting task. Thirty-nine League members in Zhuolu County, Chahar Province, led 760 people to plant 98,230 trees last autumn. Zhang Wencai and three other League members from Zhang Fagu Village, Lin County, Shandong, personally experimented with seed soaking and promoted it at the village meeting, promoting the implementation of seed soaking by more than 400 households in the village. In the past year, rural Youth League members have demonstrated heroic and unyielding spirit in the struggle against disasters such as water, drought, and insects. In areas where disasters have already occurred, Youth League members have responded to the People's Government's call for production and disaster relief, leading the masses to engage in sideline production such as boiling nitrate, carrying coal, transportation and sales, cotton spinning, and fish farming, successfully overcoming the famine. According to incomplete statistics from Cang County and Tianjin two special districts in Hebei, 2,784 people in 347 villages in the two counties organized to participate in nitrate boiling under the leadership of 1,851 League members, producing more than 410,000 jin of nitrate in one month, solving the livelihood difficulties of some of the masses. Female Youth League members in rural areas also take the lead in participating in production. For example, Guo Yulan, a female labor model from Heilongjiang Province, and Wang Qingmei, a labor model and member of the People's Government of Mancheng County, Hebei, are both Youth League members. Because they themselves work and lead other women to the fields, they broke the old view that women should not work in the fields. In addition, most of the backbones in rural winter schools and people's schools are Youth League members; in the rural areas of the new districts, the establishment of League organizations has now begun, becoming an important support force for the People's Government and the Party's work in mass movements such as suppressing bandits, opposing local tyrants, reducing rent, and collecting public grain.
　　
　　League Members in Schools in Various Places Take the Lead in Learning Core Subjects Well
　　The main task of the Youth League in schools is to unite young students, learn core subjects well, and cultivate themselves into useful talents for the New China with a revolutionary outlook on life and world view, rich knowledge and skills. In the early days of liberation in various cities, Youth League members in schools cooperated with administrative leaders and united students, playing a model role in establishing a conscious learning order. Last summer and winter vacations, about 250,000 people participated in learning activities organized in 50 large and medium-sized cities across the country. The Youth League helps transform and improve the thinking of classmates and establish a revolutionary outlook on life through various forms such as youth lectures, youth academies, natural science research associations, and clubs. Many Youth League members first learn their core subjects well in school and enthusiastically help others. For example, all eleven model students elected by the entire school of Harbin No. 4 Middle School are League members. The total score of League members in the school's coursework and conduct is mostly above 80 points. Under the guidance of teachers, League members in many schools in Northeast China make their own teaching aids, organize various research groups and a variety of extracurricular activities to assist in classroom learning.
　　
　　The work of building the League in the army has not been long, and there are currently nearly 100,000 League members. It has shown achievements in learning culture, military technology and enlivening army life.
　　
　　Supplying Cadres to All Parties; Many League Members Gloriously Join the Party
　　In the past year, the Youth League has supplied a considerable number of cadres to all parties. Many Youth League members have gloriously joined the Party under the leadership of the Party and the education of the League. Most of the Party members absorbed by Shanghai in industrial workers are League members. In northern Shaanxi alone, according to statistics in the second half of last year, there were 1,215 League members who joined the Party.
　　
　　In 1950, the China New Democratic Youth League will have greater development. The League organization will be universally established in the People's Liberation Army; in the new districts where land reform is about to be carried out, the focus will be on developing the League organization in coordination with the struggle to eliminate the feudal land system, and this will be used as one of the preparatory steps for building the Party. The important tasks of the Youth League in the future are to improve the work of the branch, strengthen the regular education of League members, so as to give greater play to the role of the League.

　　青年团一年来迅速发展
    团员达一百七十万人
    在各项工作中发挥了重大作用
    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团在中国共产党的领导与帮助下，一年来获得了光辉的成就。青年团的组织有很大的发展。据今年二月的统计，团员人数已有一百七十万八千一百二十九人。随着团的组织的发展，团在党和人民政府号召的各项实际工作中的重大作用日益显著。
    工厂矿山和企业中在团员涌现成千新纪录创造者
    青年团在工厂、矿山和企业中的一切工作都是围绕着恢复与发展工业生产的总任务进行的。如牡丹江、沈阳、锦州、徐州、济南、青岛、开封等地铁路工厂或机务段的青年团员，团结了广大青年工人和成年工人，利用工余时间，修复机车，屡次受到表扬。青年团员一方面表现了高度的自觉的劳动态度，积极生产，节约原料，爱护机器，或自动增加工作时间，进行义务劳动；另方面又积极钻研技术，改进工具和生产方法，涌现了数以千计的新纪录创造者，在创新纪录运动中发挥了先锋作用。沈阳机器三厂青年团员赵国有的事迹便是其中的典型范例。去年七月，该厂号召创造新纪录，青年团支部首先响应，并提出发明、创造、改进工具和改进工作方法。在此一号召下，团员赵国有改造工具成功，首创二点二十分车一个塔轮的纪录（原估工为十六小时），接着，他发明了“车铣结合”的操作方法，又创造一点十六分半的纪录，最后又缩短到只用五十分钟。由于赵国有的带头行动，全厂的工人都卷入了创造新纪录运动。接着机器五厂青年团员佟俊山创造了三十七分车一个塔轮的纪录。赵国有的斯塔哈诺夫式的英雄事迹传遍了全东北。在中国共产党中央东北局和东北人民政府工业部的号召下，各个工厂、矿山展开了一个在新中国工业建设中的群众性的创造新纪录运动。各地的青年团员在这个运动中都成为一支带头的力量。据极不完全的统计：沈阳市在去年十一月和十二月两个月内，六千多名青工团员中有一千一百余人创造了新纪录。吉林市一个半月内有二百二十五名团员创造了二百三十件新纪录。安东市到去年十一月底，在十四个工厂企业中有团员二百零八人创造了新纪录。到现在，华北、华东的部分城市中，也有团员创造了新纪录。表现了青年团员勇于响应人民政府和党的号召，善于接受新鲜事物的高贵品质。但青年们一般地技术水平比较低，所以青年团注意了在团员和青年工人中广泛地进行文化、技术教育，发动团员积极地参加行政和工会办的各种文化、技术学习班，并在各种学习班中起着骨干作用。许多地区的青年团，在党的领导、行政支持、工会协助下，开展了尊师爱徒运动，团结老年工人，广泛地推行订立师徒合同的方法，迅速有效地提高青年工人的技术水平。此外，一部分女青年团员在各方面的帮助下，参加了重工业建设，中国的第一位女拖拉机手梁军、第一批火车女司机田桂英、毕桂英、王宝鸿及十八岁青年女镟盘工戚桂芝，都是优秀的青年团员。
    农村团员响应政府号召  带动生产积极协助救灾
    在农村中，许多青年团员积极响应人民政府和党的号召，在多种粮、棉、花生等作物、组织变工互助、植树造林、提高并改进农作法等方面都起了带头作用。他们一面深入进行宣传工作，一面以自己的模范行动消除了部分农民的“几辈老人都没干过”的保守观念。河北等地农村中的青年团员，保证自己完成种棉任务，并说服家长和邻居，带动了一部分群众种植棉花，在完成政府布置的种植棉花的任务上起了很大作用。察哈尔省卓鲁县三十九名团员带动群众七百六十人，去年秋天植树九八、二三○棵。山东临邑八区张法古村团员张文才等四人亲自试验浸种，并在村民大会上介绍推广，推动全村四百多户实行了浸种。在去年一年中，农村青年团员在与水、旱、虫等灾害进行斗争中、表现了英勇不屈的气概。在灾害已形成的地区，青年团员响应了人民政府生产救灾的号召，带动群众进行熬硝、背煤、运销、纺棉、治鱼等副业生产，胜利渡过灾荒。据河北沧县、天津两个专区的不完全统计，两个县三四七个村在一、八五一个团员的带动下，有二、七八四名群众组织起来参加了熬硝，一个月出硝四十一万多斤，解决了部分群众的生活困难。农村中的女青年团员也带头参加生产，如黑龙江省女劳动模范郭玉兰，河北满城县县人民政府委员、劳动模范王青梅都是青年团员。由于她们自己劳动，并带动其他妇女下地，打破了妇女不下地的旧观点。此外，在农村冬学与民校的学习中，大部骨干都是青年团员；在新区农村中，现在也已经开始建立团的组织，在剿匪、反霸、减租以及缴收公粮等群众运动中，成为人民政府和党的工作中的重要支持力量。
    各地学校团员  带头学好正课
    青年团在学校中的主要工作是团结青年学生，学好正课，培养自己成为具有革命的人生观与世界观，具有丰富知识和技能的新中国的有用人材。在各城市的解放初期，学校中的青年团员配合行政领导，团结同学，在建立自觉的学习秩序上起了模范作用。去年暑假和寒假，全国五十个大、中城市组织了约有二十五万人参加的学习活动。青年团通过青年讲座、青年学园、自然科学研究会、俱乐部等各种形式，帮助改造与提高同学思想，建立革命人生观。许多青年团员在学校中首先自己学好正课，并热心帮助别人。如哈尔滨第四中学全校选举出来的十一名模范学生都是团员，该校团员的课业与操行的总分数绝大多数在八十分以上。东北许多学校的团员，在教员指导下，自己制作教学用具，组织各种钻研小组以及多种多样的课外活动，以辅助课内学习。
    部队中建团工作开始不久，目前已有团员将近十万人。在学习文化、军事技术和活跃部队生活上已显示了成绩。
    为各方面输送干部  很多团员光荣入党
    一年来，青年团为各方面输送了相当数量的干部。有很多青年团员在党的领导和团的教育下已光荣入党。上海在产业工人中吸收的党员大部为团员。仅陕北一地，据去年下半年统计，入党的团员有一、二一五人。
    一九五○年，中国新民主主义青年团将要有更大的发展，在人民解放军中将要普遍建立团的组织；在将要进行土地改革的新区则将配合消灭封建土地制度的斗争，着重发展团的组织，并以此作为建党的准备步骤之一。今后青年团的重要任务为健全支部工作，加强对于团员的经常教育，以更大的发挥团的作用。
