　　Preparing for Land Reform This Winter and Next Spring
　  Hubei Decides to Train 25,000 Cadres
    [Hankou News] According to the Changjiang Daily: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in preparation for carrying out land reform throughout the province this winter and next spring, has decided to train 25,000 land reform cadres. The training work will be the responsibility of Hubei People's Revolutionary University, as well as the local prefectural and county committees of the CCP in the province. The local prefectural committees will select and train 3,000 on-the-job personnel; after training, they can serve as grassroots backbones and as targets for cultivating district cadres. The county committees are mainly responsible for selecting and training farmer activists who emerged from the spring rent reduction movement, with 15,000 people to be trained before land reform; after training, they can be promoted to township-level cadres or organize work teams according to their respective conditions. The Provincial Committee also instructed various localities that this training work should be carried out during the slack season of rural production, so as not to hinder production. The content of the training should focus on learning land reform policies, the mass line, and class division in the prefectural committee training classes; the county training classes should focus on discussing whether the spring rent reduction was thorough, and whether there were problems such as corruption, waste, and sheltering landlords, in order to correct the cadres' positions and work styles. Education on Party building and League building will also be carried out during the training. The Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee also instructed the propaganda departments of local prefectural and county committees to coordinate with the Organization Department in training land reform cadres as the important central work for the next few months. The heads of the propaganda departments of local prefectural and county committees must personally preside over the training work, and constantly study and improve the education plans, curriculum content, and learning methods. In the training, enlightening reports must be given based on the actual situation, and then combined with the cadres' thoughts and work to conduct inspections and discussions. Planned typical speeches should be organized to inspire and guide everyone to give full play to free thinking; comparative teaching methods should be adopted to open up the cadres' thinking; at the same time, it is necessary to overcome empiricism and rigid teaching methods that simply explain regulations. After the completion of the study, a summary should be carried out to further improve everyone's policy thinking.
