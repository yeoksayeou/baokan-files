　　East China District Songjiang Telecommunications Bureau
    Repeated Electrocution Accidents
    Relevant Personnel Punished
    [Report from our East China Bureau] The Songjiang Telecommunications Bureau in East China District, due to failure to follow regulations during construction, leading to telephone line breakage and contact with power lines, resulted in the electrocution deaths of citizens in November of last year and February of this year. These incidents fully demonstrate the negligence, carelessness, and irresponsibility of the Wuxi Command Bureau and the Songjiang Telecommunications Bureau in their work. Based on investigation results and the reports from the Wuxi Command Bureau and the Songjiang Bureau, the East China Telecommunications Administration has meted out punishments of varying degrees to the relevant personnel. To prevent similar incidents from occurring, the East China Telecommunications Administration has issued a circular to all telecommunications departments in the region, urging them to learn a serious lesson from this, strictly establish various systems, especially a strict inspection system. It also calls on all bureaus and stations to conduct reviews in connection with their work, and to put forward suggestions for improvement and accident prevention. At the same time, the East China Telecommunications Administration reviewed its own bureaucratic work style of not going deep enough into the field and not understanding the situation at the lower levels, and its responsibility for failing to promptly discover and correct the errors of the Songjiang Bureau, which resulted in the unfortunate accidents. It has requested the East China Military and Political Committee and the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to impose penalties.
