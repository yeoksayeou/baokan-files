Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th: The Rehe Provincial People's Government, following the policy decision of the State Council on unifying national financial and economic work, meticulously re-examined the province's 1950 fiscal revenue and expenditure budget. It completely eliminated the original budget's 20% fiscal deficit, squeezed out 10,000 tons of grain for production and disaster relief, and still had a surplus of 806 tons of grain. The Northeast People's Government Ministry of Finance has issued a commendation for this.

Rehe Province has always been impoverished. Coupled with years of natural disasters, limited income from state-owned enterprises, and underdeveloped private industry and commerce, the financial difficulties were quite severe. Over the past year, the province's financial work had achieved certain results in overcoming difficulties, supporting the front lines, restoring war damage, and carrying out disaster relief, and it completed the tasks of collecting public grain and taxes. However, on the other hand, many shortcomings also existed in the province's financial work: First, there was no plan for fiscal revenue and expenditure. Some cadres had departmentalism, did not cherish state resources, and even committed dereliction of duty and corruption. Over the past year, counties had privately used 1.02 million jin of public grain; over 2 million jin of public grain had become moldy, stolen, or embezzled due to poor storage; over 6.8 million jin of millet had been lost due to improper allocation; and construction costs exceeded the original budget by more than seven and a half times due to indiscriminate spending. Second, many cadres neglected tax collection work, resulting in tax evasion, smuggling, and tax avoidance accounting for two-thirds of the total amount due; coupled with the underdeveloped private industry and commerce, industrial and commercial taxes accounted for only one-tenth of agricultural taxes. Third, state-owned enterprises lacked economic accounting systems in their operations and management. For example, the province planned to invest 4 million jin of millet last year to establish twelve factories and mines. As a result, among the factories and mines that had started operations, some were losing money and could not be self-sufficient, while others were barely maintaining themselves; those that had not yet started operations still needed additional investment, becoming a major burden. In addition, materials scattered throughout the region were ignored by general cadres, who believed that "nothing could be cleared up"; warehouses left by the Fourth Field Army when it went south and equipment from factories and mines left by the Japanese invaders were unattended, resulting in significant mold and losses; steel rails along the railway were scattered, and several incidents of theft and sale were discovered. All of these affected the province's finances to the extent that it could not only not be self-sufficient, but its income relied on subsidies from higher authorities for more than 75% of its income.

The Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Party Committee made separate self-criticisms based on the above serious situation, believing that in addition to various objective factors, the main reason was that the leadership lacked understanding and experience in economic construction, did not delve into specific situations, and did not work hard to study economic construction; there was a guerrilla style of work, resulting in passive work and failure to make correct work plans, and many systems were not implemented. In order to improve the financial situation, the province re-examined this year's financial budget. In terms of increasing revenue, the first step was to strengthen tax collection work, improve the quality of cadres, strengthen anti-smuggling efforts, and strive to exceed tax revenue targets. The second step was to appropriately concentrate resources, run enterprises well, recover production funds borrowed by various units, and increase the agricultural production tasks of various units. This could increase fiscal revenue by 9.63% compared to the original budget. The third step was to vigorously clean up materials, oppose corruption and waste, and clean up the internal affairs of various agencies. In terms of reducing expenditures, all secondary or unreasonable expenditures were stopped, resulting in a 10.66% reduction in fiscal expenditures compared to the original budget. After review, the balance of revenue and expenditure not only completely eliminated the 20% fiscal deficit, squeezed out 10,000 tons of production and disaster relief grain, but also had a surplus of 806 tons of grain.

The Northeast People's Government Ministry of Finance issued a special commendation for this, and called on all regions to learn from the province. The province is now beginning to focus on cleaning up materials, uniformly managing real estate and transportation, and will focus on strengthening the ideological education of all cadres, establishing an overall concept, and mobilizing affiliated units to re-examine the annual budget and tighten expenditures in order to save more funds for investment in production.

　　热河重审财政概算
　　消灭全部赤字尚有盈余         
　　东北人民政府财政部通报表扬
    【新华社十二日讯】沈阳讯：热河省人民政府根据政务院统一国家财经工作决定的方针，精打细算地重新审核了该省一九五○年的财政收支概算，完全消灭了原概算的百分之二十的财政赤字，并挤出生产救灾贷粮一万吨，此外尚盈余八百零六吨粮食。对此，东北人民政府财政部已加以通报表扬。
    热河省一向贫瘠，加以连年灾荒、公营企业收入无多、私营工商业不发达等各种原因，财政困难相当严重。一年来，该省财政工作在克服困难、支援前线、恢复战争创伤以及救灾工作上曾有一定成绩，并完成了公粮和税收任务。但另一方面，该省财政工作中却同时存在着很多缺点：首先是在财政收支上没有计划，某些干部存在着本位主义的思想，不爱护国家资材，甚至渎职乱纪。一年来各县私自动用公粮达一百零二万斤；因保管不良致霉烂、被盗或被贪污公粮达二百多万斤；因调拨不当赔累达六百八十余万斤小米；因不分轻重缓急而开支的修建费超过原预算的七倍半。其次是很多干部轻视税收工作，因而漏税、走私、逃税者占了应征总额的三分之二；加以私营工商业不发达，因此工商业税收仅占农业税的十分之一。再其次是公营企业在经营管理上没有经济核算制度。如该省去年计划投资四百万斤小米创办十二个厂、矿，结果已开工的厂矿中，有的赔累而不能自给，有的勉强维持；未开工的则仍须追加投资，成为一大负担。此外，散存各地的物资，更为一般干部所漠视，被认为“清理不出什么东西”；第四野战军南下时所留下的仓库以及日寇残留的厂矿设备均无人看管，霉烂损失甚多；铁路沿线钢轨纵横，几经发现盗卖事件。这些都影响了该省财政上不但不能自给，以致其一年来收入依赖上级补拨的部分竟占百分之七十五以上。
    该省人民政府及中共省委根据上述严重情况，分别作了检讨，认为除去各种客观因素以外，主要是因为领导方面对经济建设缺乏认识和经验，没有钻研具体情况和努力学习经济建设；存在着游击作风，致使工作被动，未能作出正确的工作计划，许多制度亦未能贯彻执行。为了改进财经状况，该省重新审核了本年度财经概算。在增加收入方面，首先提出加强税收工作，提高干部质量，加强缉私，以争取超过税收任务。其次是适当地集中力量，办好企业，收回借予各单位的生产基金，增加各单位的农业生产任务。这样可使财政收入较原预算增加百分之九点六三。再次是大力清理物资，反对贪污浪费，清理各机关家务。在减缩开支方面，停止一切次要的或不合理的开支，结果可使财政支出较原预算减少百分之十点六六。经审核后，收支相较，不但完全消灭了百分之二十的财政赤字，挤出了一万吨生产救灾粮，另外且还盈余粮食八百零六吨。
    东北人民政府财政部对此特予通报表扬，并号召各地向该省学习。现该省正开始有重点地进行物资清理、统一管理房产和运输等工作，并将着重加强全体干部的思想教育，树立整体观念，动员所属单位重新审核全年预算，紧缩开支，以节省更多的资金投入生产。
