Northeast State-Owned and Public Enterprises Improve Democratic Management

[Shenyang News] According to the Northeast Daily, Party committees, administrations, and trade unions in state-owned and public enterprises in Northeast China are gradually paying attention to the democratic management of factories and are working to improve the current state of factory management committees. According to incomplete statistics from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, factory management committees have been established in 683 units out of more than 1,000 factories and mines. Enterprises that can truly rely on the working class and implement democratic management have strengthened the workers' sense of ownership and unleashed greater enthusiasm. The Mudanjiang Railway Station has not had a single accident since the establishment of the management committee and workers' representative assembly in June of last year, and has guaranteed the completion of production tasks and overcome production difficulties. The Changchun Tram Factory, through the management committee, was able to accurately set production plans and ensure their completion. One month, the original plan was to overhaul two trams, but three were completed, six days ahead of schedule. The Fushun Rolling Stock Factory, due to material difficulties, had five of the most damaged electric locomotives that could not be repaired. After discussion by the management committee, it was believed that the difficulties could be overcome, and the task was finally completed ahead of schedule. Secondly, democratic management has also strengthened labor discipline. In the past, violations of labor discipline often occurred at the Changchun Xinfa Dong Rice Mill. After the management committee led the masses to formulate labor discipline, the masses felt that they had participated in the formulation, and everyone mutually supervised and consciously complied. Thirdly, the relationship between the Party committee, the administration, and the trade union has also become more consistent due to the establishment of the management committee. The Fushun Steel Plant's unified deployment and leadership of the New Record Movement by the management committee changed the past phenomenon of each doing its own thing and contradicting each other, and achieved close cooperation between them. Fourthly, in places where work is better, it is also possible to learn how to manage enterprises and train cadres through the management committee. Fifthly, workers can actively suggest improvements in production management, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and strengthen the relationship between leaders and the masses. At the Anshan Iron and Steel Heavy Machinery Plant, the factory director reviewed his work style at the workers' representative meeting, and the workers immediately made more than 80 valuable suggestions. The Harbin Railway Bureau Machinery Section's workers' representative meeting put forward 980 suggestions, 78 percent of which were related to production and improving production management and cadre work style. The Jilin Inspection Section launched criticism and self-criticism at the workers' representative meeting. On the one hand, the workers criticized: "Cadres only know how to work, but do not check the work. Twenty wrenches are not easy to use, and only four or five hundred of the 1,500 screws can be used"; "The people in the warehouse are irresponsible"; "The section chief has never come to the train inspection to check the work." At the same time, they also conducted self-criticism. Such use of workers' representative meetings can effectively overcome the bad style of bureaucracy and strengthen the relationship between leaders and the masses.

However, the factories and mines that have achieved such significant results in democratic management are still in the minority, and even in these few factories and mines, the achievements are relatively scattered and not consolidated. So far, a relatively complete good example cannot be presented. The vast majority of management committees are reduced to formalities and do not play a role. In the four salt industry sub-bureaus with thirty-one management committees, less than 20 percent are effective. Even this 20 percent is wave-like, sometimes effective and sometimes not. The railway system has established management committees and workers' representative meetings in 262 larger units, but very few have done a good job. In Harbin, where the management committee was established earlier, 43 of the 52 larger factories have management committees, but all have more or less formalism.

		Relying on Workers to Manage Factories Well: Leaders' Thinking Is Not Yet Strong

The fundamental reason for these situations is that leaders have not yet truly established a firm belief in relying on the entire working masses to manage factories and enterprises well and that "the central task of implementing democratic management at present is to truly do a good job of the factory management committee." The following phenomena are still relatively common: First, insufficient attention to the organization of the management committee and a lack of a democratic style: One is that the management committee is established at the call of the administration, and the impression among the masses is not deep. More than 80 percent of the management committees established in Songjiang Province were established in this way. Even more, the factory affairs meeting was changed to the management committee. Another is a misunderstanding of the factory director's final decision-making power. They say, "I have the final decision-making power. If my roots don't move, your branches will shake in vain." Another is that workers' opinions are not valued, and it is believed that the opinions put forward by worker representatives in the management committee are "trivial matters" and "not complete at all." Another is that the management committee does not solve practical problems. Some factory management committee meetings are not held regularly, stipulating that they are only open for three hours, the factory director speaks for a long time, and before the worker representatives can make suggestions, it is time to end the meeting; in some factories, administrative leaders are afraid that the committee members will not be able to study matters, so they only put forward their own opinions, and everyone is responsible for passing it. Some factories' administrations drafted factory rules and submitted them to the management committee for approval. If the workers have opinions, they are neither explained nor corrected. After the announcement, if someone does not comply, it is the same.

Second, there is still skepticism about the role of the management committee: Some people think that in the Northeast, the old management institutions and systems have been reformed, and the organization of the management committee is not necessarily essential. Another person believes that the administrative leadership can complete the production plan as it is now, so why organize a management committee? Another saying: It is difficult for workers to put forward comprehensive opinions at the management committee at one time, which requires administrative leaders to do sufficient preparation work and patient enlightenment education, and the administration is already too busy to complete the production plan, so where is the time to do these things? Regarding the completion of the production plan and democratic management as two different things. Still another person doubts whether the factory director responsibility system will conflict with the management committee, and does not see that the two are mutually combined rather than mutually conflicting.

Third, there is a lack of summary and firm implementation of the work of the management committee. Many specific problems encountered in various places, such as how the management committee organization should play a role, what responsibilities the trade union should bear, whether the management committee should be divided into groups, how to hold meetings, prepare, convey, what issues to discuss, who is suitable to participate, etc., have not been seriously studied and left to their own devices.

		Actively Care About the Work of the Management Committee: Some Trade Unions Are Still Not Doing Enough

Fourth, the trade union has not actively paid attention to the work of the management committee. Some trade union cadres believe that this is the responsibility of the administration. The trade union director of the Jinzhou Textile Factory in Dalian is not actively urging improvement in the work of the management committee. He comes to the meeting when he is notified, and does not ask if the meeting is not held. He rarely educates the workers on democratic management. The workers do not know whether there is a management committee in their factory. This phenomenon is almost universal in other places.

Recently, some factories and mines have begun to pay attention to the work of the management committee, and have begun to study Chairman Gao Gang's report "On the Restoration and Reconstruction of the Northeast Economy" and the People's Daily's editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises." Generally, they have initially realized that if the management committee is reduced to formalities, it will be extremely detrimental to the operation and management of the enterprise. At the same time, they have also realized that it is necessary to establish a clear understanding among the cadres of the Party committee, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League that the implementation of democratic management is a fundamental key to managing enterprises well at present. It is necessary to further change the work style, summarize experience, and transform this policy into practical action.

### 东北国营公营企业改进民主管理工作

　　东北国营公营企业改进民主管理工作
    【沈阳讯】据东北日报消息：东北各国公营企业的党委、行政、工会逐渐注意工厂管理民主化的工作，并着手改进厂矿管理委员会的目前状况。根据东北总工会最近不完全的统计，在一千多个厂矿中，有六百八十三个单位成立了工厂管理委员会。凡是真正能够依靠工人阶级，实行管理民主化的企业，都加强了工人的主人翁感，发挥更大的积极性。牡丹江车站从去年六月成立管委会和工人代表会议后，就空前地没有发生过事故，而且保证完成了生产任务和克服了生产中的困难。长春电车厂就是通过了管委会，使生产计划订得准确且保证完成。有一个月原计划大修二台电车，结果完成三台，还提前了六天。抚顺车辆厂，由于材料困难，有五台破损最大的电动机车不能完成修理任务，经过管委会讨论后，认为可以克服困难，终于提前完成任务。其次、管理民主化也加强了劳动纪律。长春新发东制米厂，以前经常发生违犯劳动纪律的现象，在管委会领导群众订出劳动纪律以后，群众都觉得这是自己参加订立的，大家就互相督促自觉遵守。第三、党委、行政、工会的关系，也因有了管委会而取得步调一致。抚顺制钢厂由管委会统一布置与领导新纪录运动，就改变了过去各搞一套，互相抵触的现象，而达到了互相间的密切配合。第四、工作较好的地方，还能通过管委会学习管理企业、培养干部。第五、工人能积极建议提出改进生产管理的意见，进行批评与自我批评，密切领导与群众关系。鞍钢重机厂厂长在工代会上检讨了自己的作风，工人当场就提了八十余条宝贵意见。哈铁机务段工代会上提出九百八十条建议，百分之七十八是有关生产及改进生产管理与干部作风的。吉林检车段工代会上展开了批评与自我批评。工人一方面批评：“干部只知道干活，不检查工作。二十把扳子都不好使，一千五百个螺丝只有四五百个能用”；“仓库的人不负责任”；“段长从来没有到列检检查工作”。同时也进行了自我检讨。这样的运用工人代表会议，可以有效地克服官僚主义的不良作风，密切领导与群众的关系。
    但是，管理民主化，取得如上显著作用的厂矿仍是少数，而且在这些少数厂矿中，成绩都是比较零散也不巩固，到现在还不能拿出一个比较完整的好样子，绝大多数管委会都流于形式，不起作用。盐业四个分局三十一个管委会，起作用的还不到百分之二十，即便这百分之二十，也是波浪式的，有时起作用，有时就不起作用。铁路二百六十二个较大单位成立了管委会、工代会，但搞好的很少。管委会建立较早的哈尔滨，较大的五十二个工厂中，四十三个有了管委会，也都是或多或少的存在着形式主义。
            依靠工人管好工厂  领导思想尚不坚强
    造成这些情况的基本原因，是由于领导干部思想上还没有真正建立起依靠全体工人群众管好工厂企业和“目前实行管理民主化的中心工作是真正搞好工厂管理委员会”的坚强信念。仍较普遍地存在着下面这些现象：第一、对管委会组织不够重视和缺乏民主作风：一种是管委会由行政号召而成立的，群众中印象不深，松江省这样成立的管委会就有百分之八十以上。更有将厂务会议改为管委会的。一种是误解厂长最后决定权，他们说：“我有最后决定权，我树根不动，你们树梢白晃荡。”一种是不重视工人意见，认为在管委会上工人代表所提的意见“都是鸡毛蒜皮的事”，“一点完整的也没有”。一种是管委会不解决实际问题，有的工厂管委会会议不定期举行，规定只开三个钟点，厂长讲话很长，不等工人代表提意见，就该散会了；有的工厂行政领导干部有事怕委员研究不了，只把自己意见提出来，通过一下大家负责就算了。有的工厂行政草拟了厂规拿到管委会通过，工人有意见，既未解释，也没更正，宣布以后，有人不遵守，也就那样。
    第二、对管委会作用还抱怀疑态度：一种人以为，在东北，旧的管理机构和制度，已经过改造，管委会组织不一定非要不可。又一种人认为，像现在这样行政领导也能完成生产计划，又何必再组织管委会呢？另一说法：工人一时很难在管委会上提出全面意见，这需要行政领导干部作充分准备工作与耐心启发教育，而行政为完成生产计划已经忙不开交，那有时间做这些事情？把完成生产计划与管理民主化看做两回事。再还有一种人怀疑厂长负责制会不会和管委会矛盾，没有看到两者是互相结合而非互相冲突的。
    第三、对管委会工作缺乏总结与坚决贯彻的精神，各地碰到的很多具体问题，如管委会组织如何发挥作用，工会应负什么责任，管委会应不应分组，怎样开会、准备、传达，讨论什么问题，什么人参加合适等等，均未认真研究，任其自流。
            主动关心管委会工作  有些工会还做得不够
    第四、工会未积极主动注意管委会的工作。有些工会干部认为这是行政上的责任。旅大金州纺织厂的工会主任对管委会工作就不积极督促改进，通知他开会就来，不开会就不问，很少向工人进行管理民主化的教育，工人不知道本厂有没有管委会。这种现象，其他各地也几乎普遍存在。
    最近，有些厂矿已开始注意管委会的工作，开始研究高岗主席“关于恢复与重建东北经济”的报告和人民日报“学会管理企业”的社论，一般均初步认识到如管委会流于形式，对企业的经营与管理是极不利的。同时也认识了：必须在党委、行政、工会、青年团干部中树立明确的认识，实行管理民主化是目前管好企业的一个根本关键，必须进一步转变作风，总结经验，把这一方针变为实际行动。
