Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th: With the improvement of the national financial situation and the stabilization of prices, the lives of the 1.2 million people in Guangzhou are becoming more stable. The food in the canteens of factories, government offices, schools, and organizations is better than before. The catering group of the Military Control Region 6 Telecommunications Bureau, which handles the meals for more than 90 people, charged 80 jin of high-quality rice per person per month in March. In mid-April, this was changed to 80 jin of medium-quality rice. This month, due to further price stabilization, it has been changed to 64 jin of medium-quality rice. The more than 900 workers of the Second Textile Factory have maintained the original standard of food expenses after the price stabilization, but the daily vegetable expenses are more than one million yuan less than before. Workers no longer need to purchase and hoard goods as they did in the past after receiving their wages. Shi Liangdong, a worker at the repair shop of Guangdong Automobile Transportation Company, used to buy physical goods immediately after receiving his salary, but now he saves the extra money. Zhang Desheng, a worker at the Guangjiu Locomotive Section of the Guangzhou Railway Sub-bureau, did not have money to send home when prices fluctuated, but after prices stabilized, he sent 200,000 yuan home. The stable prices have also brought smiles to the faces of ordinary citizens' housewives. In the past, 1,000 yuan could only buy one egg at the market, but now the same amount of money can buy three. The money that used to buy one jin of pork can now buy more than two and a half jin of pork. Housewives like to talk about prices when they meet. Zhu Zhangqiu, a housewife in the Shamian District, said: "Now that I have the household expenses, I can have an accurate budget!" Zheng Mumei, a housewife from an overseas Chinese family living in Dongshan, said: "During the Kuomintang period, money remitted from abroad would depreciate the day after it was received, so we didn't dare to send the money back even if we earned it. Now that prices are stable and the government takes special care of the families of overseas Chinese, life is much better than in the past!"

　　财经情况好转物价平稳
    广州人民生活日趋安定
    工人学生家庭主妇莫不笑逐颜开
    【新华社广州十七日电】全国财经情况好转和物价平稳以后，广州市一百二十万人民的生活已日趋安定。各工厂、机关、学校团体的伙食已比以前为好。军管六区电信管理局的伙食团，办理九十多个人的伙食，在三月间每人每月的伙食要收八十斤上等大米，到了四月中旬即改收八十斤中等米，到了本月，因为物价进一步平稳，已改收六十四斤中等米。纺织二厂九百多个工友，在物价稳定后，仍维持原来的伙食费用的标准，但每天菜金开支则比以前节省一百多万元。工人们领到工资后，不必再像从前那样购藏物资了。广东汽车运输公司修理厂工人史良栋，从前领到了薪金后，马上买实物，而现在有了余钱便存下来了。广州铁路分局广九机务段工人张德胜在物价波动时没有钱寄回家里，物价安定后，已寄了二十万元回家。物价平稳，也使一般小市民的家庭主妇们笑逐颜开。从前拿一千元到小菜场，只能买到一个鸡蛋，现在以同样的钱可以买到三个。从前买一斤猪肉的钱现在可以拿来买二斤半以上的猪肉。主妇们碰在一起，便喜欢把物价当作话题来谈论。沙面区家庭妇女朱章球说：“现在拿到家用，可以有一个精确预算了！”住在东山的华侨家庭妇女郑慕美说：“国民党时期，从外洋汇钱返家，今天收到汇款，明天就跌价，赚到钱也不敢寄回来；现在物价平稳，政府又特别照顾侨眷，日子比过去好过得多了！”
