　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 12th: Fujian's new wheat harvest is the most abundant in twenty years. Western Fujian averages 130 to 150 catties of wheat per mu, while Southern and Eastern Fujian average 200 to 250 catties per mu. All areas have exceeded the yields of previous years by 20% to 30%, with some individual areas exceeding them by about 60%. Farmers are celebrating the bumper harvest, saying, "This is the blessing brought by Chairman Mao."
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th: Spring wheat planting in the Northeast has been completed on time, and wheat seedlings have generally emerged to a height of two inches. According to incomplete statistics from the five provinces of Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Liaoxi, Liaodong, Jilin, and the suburbs of Shenyang, the total wheat planting area in the Northeast region this year has reached more than 6.6 million mu, an increase of more than 300,000 mu compared to last year. The main wheat-producing provinces, Heilongjiang and Songjiang, account for more than one-half of the region's cultivated land. Heilongjiang Province (excluding four counties in the Heihe region) has planted a total of 2.93 million mu of wheat this year, an increase of 36,000 mu over last year; Songjiang Province's actual planting area exceeded the plan by nearly 80,000 mu. Due to the timely and harmonious rainfall before and after wheat planting in various places, the growth of wheat seedlings is extremely vigorous.
    The widespread and timely wheat planting in various places this year is mainly due to the fact that most areas have adopted the experience of early planting and increased yields from last year, and began planting before the Qingming Festival. Farmers in the coastal provinces of Liaoxi and Liaodong and parts of Songjiang and Jilin began plowing when the ground had thawed two or three inches. The planting work in Heilongjiang Province, where the thaw was the latest, was also generally advanced by five or six days compared to previous years.

　　福建新麦丰收
　  东北种麦全部完成
　  播种面积较去年增卅万亩
    【新华社福州十二日电】福建各地新麦丰收为二十年来未有。闽西平均每亩产麦一百三十斤至一百五十斤，闽南、闽东每亩产二百斤至二百五十斤。各地都超过往年二成至三成，个别地区超过六成左右。农民欢庆丰收，都说：“这是毛主席带来的福气。”
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】东北今春小麦播种已全部适时完成，麦苗现已普遍出土二寸。据黑龙江、松江、辽西、辽东、吉林五省及沈阳市郊区不完全统计，今年东北全区小麦播种面积共达六百六十余万亩以上，较去年全区小麦播种面积增加三十余万亩。主要产麦区黑龙江、松江两省播种面积占全区耕地二分之一以上。黑龙江省（黑河地区四县除外）今年共种麦二百九十三万亩，比去年增加三万六千亩；松江省实际播种面积超过计划近八万亩。由于各地播种小麦前后雨水调和，麦苗成长均极壮旺。
    今年各地小麦播种普遍而及时，主要原因是大部地区均接受了去年早种多收的经验，在清明前即开始进行播种。沿海辽西、辽东两省及松江、吉林部分地区农民于化冻二三寸时，即纷纷开犁。解冻最晚的黑龙江省的播种工作亦普遍较往年提早五、六天。
