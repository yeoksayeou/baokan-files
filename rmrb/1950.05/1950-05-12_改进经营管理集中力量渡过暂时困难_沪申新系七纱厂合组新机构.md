　　Improving Business Management to Concentrate Efforts to Overcome Temporary Difficulties
　　Shanghai Shenxin Group's Seven Cotton Mills Combine to Form New Organization
    [Report from Our Newspaper] According to the Shanghai Xinwen Ribao on the 8th, Shanghai Shenxin Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 and Hefeng cotton mills, in order to achieve democratic management and business enterprise, decided to jointly organize a new company. Starting from the 8th, these seven Shenxin-affiliated cotton mills began operating under the name of "Shanghai Shenxin Textile Mills General Management Office."

    The Shenxin textile business has been operating for more than thirty years. The seven existing cotton mills in Shanghai have a total of 398,396 spindles and 2,931 looms. In the past, the large organization, complex personnel, and disorganized structure have all become burdens in today's difficulties. After the "February 6th" bombing, the factories became even more difficult. Reforms were brewing at that time. The fundamental solution is to closely unite the Shenxin cotton mills in Shanghai, concentrate efforts to overcome difficulties, and improve production.

    On April 1st this year, the head office and the seven cotton mills signed a contract for the new organization. The company was named Shanghai Shenxin Textile Company. However, because the equity of each factory has not yet been unified (the original founders were Rong Zongjing and Rong Desheng, whose equity accounted for 80 percent. The major shareholders of the Rong Zongjing system, Rong Hongyuan, Rong Hongsan, and Rong Hongqing, are all residing in Hong Kong), each factory can only sign contracts with the head office within its authority. For external purposes, it is temporarily called "Shanghai Shenxin Textile Mills General Management Office." When conditions are ripe, it can be renamed Shanghai Shenxin Textile Company.

    Currently, each factory has nominated representatives to form an eleven-member Management Committee as the company's highest decision-making body. Rong Desheng is the chairman of the committee. Rong Yiren is the general manager of the new company. There are six departments under the committee: Secretariat, Engineering, Business, Finance, Purchasing, and Auditing. The main responsibilities are: ① All businesses of each factory, such as purchasing cotton and selling yarn, will first be handled uniformly by the General Management Office, and then uniformly by the head office; ② The financial revenue and expenditure of each factory will be centrally scheduled by the company, but the accounting will initially be independent for each factory, each bearing its own profits and losses. In the second step, it will be handled uniformly by the head office; ③ The production of each factory will be planned and uniformly dispatched by the company; ④ The employees of each factory will be appointed, dismissed, promoted, transferred, rewarded, and punished by the company.

    From the General Management Office to the new company organization, the contract clearly stipulates that each factory should work together to complete the unified organization and not withdraw halfway. The key to the establishment of the new company lies in the unification of the equity of each factory. Therefore, the debts of each factory have been temporarily frozen, and a materials clearing committee has been formed to clear all materials of each factory and then repay the debts separately.

    After the establishment of the General Management Office, all establishments and organizations are prepared to refer to the methods of the China Textile Construction Company. Currently, the office has a staffing of eighty people, which is in line with the principles of streamlining and economy. Among the seven cotton mills participating in the new organization, Shenxin No. 7 Mill, due to excessive debts and particularly heavy difficulties, was temporarily unable to break even. On the 30th of last month, labor and management signed an agreement to temporarily suspend work for six months. The remaining factories are prepared to unite closely under the General Management Office with unparalleled confidence, overcome difficulties, and improve production to welcome the "new life" of Shenxin. At the same time, in order to improve labor-management relations, the Shenxin Group's seven cotton mills labor-management consultation general meeting will be officially established on the 12th at the General Management Office.

### 改进经营管理集中力量渡过暂时困难　沪申新系七纱厂合组新机构

　　改进经营管理集中力量渡过暂时困难
　　沪申新系七纱厂合组新机构
    【本报讯】据上海新闻日报八日消息：上海申新第一、二、五、六、七、九及合丰等七个纱厂，为了达到管理民主化和经营企业化，决联合组织新公司。自八日起，这七个申新系的纱厂，开始以“上海申新纺织厂总管理处”的名义，对外经营业务。
    申新纺织事业经营三十多年。上海现存的七个纱厂共有纱锭三九八三九六枚，纺机二九三一台。由于过去机构庞大，人事复杂，组织散漫，都成为今天困难的包袱。“二六”轰炸后，各厂益趋艰难。当时即酝酿改革。根本办法是把申新在沪的纱厂紧密团结起来，集中力量克服困难，搞好生产。
    本年四月一日，总公司和七个纱厂订立了新组织的合同，公司定名为上海申新纺织公司。但因目前各厂股权尚未统一（原创办人有荣宗敬，荣德生两大系统，其股权占百分之八十。现荣宗敬系统的大股东荣鸿元、荣鸿三、荣鸿庆等均留居香港），故各厂仅能在职权范围以内与总公司签订合同，对外暂称“上海申新纺织厂总管理处”，俟条件成熟，即可改称上海申新纺织公司。
    现各厂已推派代表，组织了十一人的管理委员会，作为公司的最高决策机关。委员会以荣德生为主席。新公司由荣毅仁任总经理。下设秘书、工务、业务、财务、购料、稽核等六处。主要职责为：①各厂一切业务如购花销纱等，先由总管理处代为统一办理，继由总公司统一办理；②各厂的财务收支由公司集中调度，但其会计第一步为各厂各自独立，各自负担盈亏，到第二步即由总公司统一办理；③各厂的生产由公司制订生产计划，统一指挥调度；④各厂所属员工，统由公司任免、升调、奖惩。
    从总管理处走向新的公司组织，合同上明确订定各厂应一致努力，完成统一的组织，不得中途退出。新公司的成立，主要关键在各厂股权的统一，故各厂债务现已暂行冻结，另组物资清理委员会，清理各厂所有物资，再分别清偿债务。
    总管理处成立后，一切编制组织，准备参照中国纺建公司的办法。现该处定员为八十人，符合精简节约的原则。参加新组织的七家纱厂中，申新七厂以负债过多，困难特重，一时无法做到保本，已于上月三十日由劳资双方签订协议，暂行停工六个月。其余各厂已准备紧密的团结在总管理处之下，以无比的信心，克服困难，搞好生产，来迎接申新的“新生”。同时为了搞好劳资关系，申新系七个纱厂的劳资协商总会，定十二日在总管理处正式成立。
