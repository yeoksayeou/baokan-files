　　Philippine Government, Under US Imperialist Instructions, Attempts to Invade My Tuansha Islands
　　Beijing Qualified Person States: If the US-Philippines Do Not Abandon Their Adventurous Plan, It Will Inevitably Cause Serious Consequences.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] Certain figures in the Philippine puppet government, controlled by the United States, have recently been instructed to release information about their intention to invade China's Tuansha Islands. According to Manila news: Philippine President Quirino, at a press conference on May 17th, declared in a provocative tone: "If the Kuomintang troops are indeed occupying the Tuansha Islands, then the Philippines will not need to request to occupy the area. If it is in the hands of the enemy, it threatens the security of our country." Quirino fabricated an absurd theory for his aggressive attempt, saying, "According to international law, the islands should be under the jurisdiction of the nearest country, and the country closest to the Tuansha Islands is the Philippines."
    A qualified person in Beijing pointed out: The Philippine government's absurd propaganda regarding Chinese territory is clearly based on instructions from the US government. Philippine provocateurs and their American supporters must abandon their adventurous plan, otherwise it will inevitably cause serious consequences. The People's Republic of China will absolutely not allow the Tuansha Islands and any other islands in the South China Sea belonging to China to be invaded by any foreign country. (Attached image)

　　菲政府听从美帝指示妄图侵占我团沙群岛
　　北京有资格人士指出：美菲如不放弃冒险计划，必引起严重后果。
    【新华社十九日讯】美国掌握中的菲律宾傀儡政府中的某些人物，近日被授意放出企图侵犯我国领土团沙群岛的空气。据马尼拉消息：菲总统季里诺五月十七日在记者招待会上以挑衅式的口吻宣称：“如果国民党军队真的占领着团沙群岛，则菲律宾就无须要求占领该地。如果在敌人手里，即威胁我们国家的安全。”季里诺为他的侵略企图制造一种荒谬的理论说：“根据国际公法，该群岛应该辖属于最邻近的国家，而距离团沙群岛最近的国家就是菲律宾。”
    北京有资格人士指出：菲律宾政府对于中国领土的这种荒谬宣传，显然是出于美国政府的指示。菲律宾挑衅者及其美国支持者必须放弃他们的这种冒险计划，否则必然引起严重的后果。中华人民共和国绝对不容许团沙群岛及南海中其他任何属于中国的岛屿被任何外国所侵犯。（附图片）
