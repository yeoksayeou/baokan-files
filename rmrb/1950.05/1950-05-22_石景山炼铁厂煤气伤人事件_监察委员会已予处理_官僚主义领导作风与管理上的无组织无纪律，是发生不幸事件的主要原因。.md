　　Stone Jing Shan Iron and Steel Plant Gas Poisoning Incident
    Supervisory Committee Has Handled It
    Bureaucratic Leadership Style and Lack of Organization and Discipline in Management Are the Main Reasons for the Unfortunate Incident.
    [Our Newspaper] The gas poisoning incident at the Iron Smelting Plant of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Factory on March 16th resulted in the death of three people. The People's Supervisory Committee of the Government Administration Council sent personnel to conduct an in-depth on-site inspection, discovered the root cause of the accident, and formulated handling measures. These measures were approved by the Government Administration Council on the 10th of this month. The incident occurred at 9:00 AM on March 16th, when Wang Rongshou, the substitute worker in the gas washing room of the factory, discovered gas in the small house in the entrance tunnel of the gas reservoir. He immediately entered to repair it and fainted from poisoning. Upon hearing the news, factory workers bravely entered the tunnel to rescue him, and nine people fainted one after another. Among them, Youth League member Wang Rongshou, Wu Guozhang, the Chinese Communist Party Branch Secretary of the Iron Smelting Plant, and Li Zengke, the Youth League Branch Secretary of the Iron Smelting Plant, died due to ineffective treatment, while the other six recovered. After the incident, the People's Supervisory Committee, under the instruction of the Government Administration Council, sent personnel to the factory on March 27th for inspection. It was discovered that serious disorganization and lack of discipline still existed in the factory's engineering equipment and plant management, which was the main cause of the incident. For example, the factory负责人 (fù zé rén) in charge had not made comprehensive arrangements for the use of the gas washer and water separator. The machinery had not been used for a long time. In mid-January, the Mechanical and Electrical Department transferred the machine to the Iron Smelting Department for management. Shi Chongzhen, the director of the Mechanical and Electrical Department, did not solemnly hand over the precautions regarding the mechanical performance, inertial faults, and damage. Zhen Yulin and others, the acting factory director and department director of the Iron Smelting Department who took over the equipment, did not inquire. When using the water separator, only Song Ensheng, the foreman of the gas washing room, asked Liu Zhengwu, the civil engineer of the Iron Smelting Department, and Liu casually replied that it could be used without asking his superiors. After using the water separator, a gas leak was discovered. Song Ensheng reported this situation to Shi Chongzhen, and civil engineer Wang Ping was ordered to send bricklayers to repair the blocking wall inside the gas pipe. The repair work was very rough. Despite two repairs, it was still ineffective. The gas actually entered the small house on the side tunnel of the coal storage. Afterwards, Song Ensheng did not report to his superiors, nor did his superiors inquire and inspect. As a result, this unfortunate incident occurred.

    The factory officials in charge have a bureaucratic and business-like style, are ideologically paralyzed, lack foresight, and do not pay enough attention to security work. The factory is very large and the production process is very complex, but a set of necessary work procedures and safety regulations has not been established. Gas is one of the factory's important properties, and improper management can easily injure people. Previously, four workers had been injured by gas poisoning, but this did not attract attention. It was not until this incident occurred that safety measures regarding gas were formulated. The deceased and injured workers showed a high degree of class love in this incident, but because the administration and the trade union usually lacked safety education for workers, this major casualty accident occurred. This should serve as a profound warning for the future.

    According to the severity of the mistakes made by the parties involved, the Supervisory Committee has given appropriate punishments to Zhen Yulin, Shi Chongzhen, Liu Zhengwu, Song Ensheng, Wang Ping, An Chaojun, Guo Ji and others. The Government Administration Council has approved preferential treatment and compensation for Wu Guozhang, Wang Rongshou, and Li Zengke, who died on duty.

　　石景山炼铁厂煤气伤人事件
    监察委员会已予处理   
    官僚主义领导作风与管理上的无组织无纪律，是发生不幸事件的主要原因。
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂炼铁厂于三月十六日，发生三人中毒牺牲事件。政务院人民监察委员会派员深入现场检查，已发现肇祸根本原因，并拟定了处理办法。此办法已于本月十日由政务院批准。事情发生于三月十六日上午九时，该厂洗气房代班工人王荣寿发觉煤气库入口坑道小屋内有煤气，当即入内修理，中毒晕倒。该厂职工闻讯，奋勇进入坑道抢救，先后晕倒九人。其中青年团员王荣寿、炼铁厂中共党支部书记吴国章、炼铁厂青年团支部书记李增科等三人，因救治无效牺牲，其余六人痊愈。事件发生后，人民监察委员会奉政务院指示，于三月二十七日派员前往该厂检查。发现该厂工程设备及厂务管理上依然存在着的严重的无组织、无纪律现象，是发生这次事件的主要原因。例如，对于洗气机与分水器的使用，该厂负责人并未全盘布置。该项机械已常久没有使用，机动课于一月中旬将该机移交炼铁课管理，机动课石重珍课长并未将机械性能，惯性故障，破损等应注意事项郑重移交，接管该设备的炼铁课代厂长兼课长甄玉林诸人亦未追问。使用分水器时，仅洗气机室领班宋恩生问过炼铁课工务员刘正武，刘随意答复可用。并未请示上级。分水器使用后，即发现漏气现象。宋恩生向石重珍报告了这种情况，工务员王萍即奉命再派瓦工修理煤气管内的堵墙。修理工程十分粗疏。虽经两次堵修，仍无效果。煤气竟通至煤库侧坑道小屋内。事后宋恩生既未向上级报告，上级也未询问检查。结果便发生了这次不幸事件。
    该厂负责人存在着官僚主义与事务主义的作风，思想麻痹，缺乏预见，对保安工作很不重视。该厂规模很大，生产过程很复杂，但未建立一套必要的工作规程及保安制度。煤气为该厂重要财产之一，管理不当极易伤人。以前曾有工友四人中毒受伤，并未引起重视。直至此次事件发生后，才制订了关于煤气的安全措施。罹难及受伤诸工友，在此次事件中表现了高度的阶级友爱，但因该厂行政与工会平日对工人缺乏保安教育，致发生此种重大牺牲事故。深值今后的警惕。
    根据当事诸人所犯错误的轻重，监委会已分别予甄玉林、石重珍、刘正武、宋恩生、王萍、安朝俊、郭际等人以应得处分。对因公牺牲的吴国章、王荣寿、李增科三人，已呈准政务院优予抚恤。
