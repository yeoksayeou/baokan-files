Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 21st – The Southwest region's warehouse material cleanup work, up to early May, has cleared out a large batch of materials that can be allocated.

　　In Chongqing, in addition to the 20,000 tons of hardware materials worth over 70 billion yuan previously cleared out, and the 21,000 tons of steel and other materials cleared out by the 10th, 11th, and 29th Ordnance Factories, the former Fourth District Telecommunications Administration and the Radio Equipment Factory, both affiliated with the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, have cleared out several thousand tons of equipment scattered by the former Kuomintang reactionary government. This equipment is sufficient to supply the existing telecommunications equipment in the Southwest for more than five years. Among them are 818 radio transceivers, 70 long-distance carrier machines and auxiliary motors, 270 various AC and DC generators, 4,448 various telegraph and telephone sets and switchboards, 57,327 various vacuum tubes, 707,415 various radio parts, and 308 tons of steel wire, providing ample material conditions for the construction of the people's telecommunications industry in the Southwest.

　　In the Chuan South region, after a month of typical experimentation in Luxian County, the cleanup work was fully launched in all special districts, cities, and counties in early April. During the experimental cleanup period in Luxian County, weapons and ammunition sufficient to equip a regiment and unrecorded materials such as cotton yarn, Western medicine, and gold worth over 9.44 million jin of rice were cleared out, correcting the erroneous view of some cadres that there was nothing to clean up in small cities. The 23rd Ordnance Factory in Luxian County cleared out 50 units of planing machines, centrifuges, etc. The Lantianba Aviation Equipment Storage Group cleared out more than 1,000 kinds of aircraft parts, including two disassembled aircraft and important aviation equipment such as direction finders and asbestos paper. In Zigong City, the banking industry cleared out 30,000 dan of salt stored in Zigong by the Zhongnan, Qiannan, and other salt companies of bureaucratic capital, as well as approximately 80,000 silver dollars of debts released by the pseudo-Central Bank and others before liberation.

　　In Chengdu alone, more than 590 boxes of medicines, totaling over 51,000 pieces, were cleared out.

　　Kunming cleared out more than 3,000 tons of aviation equipment, with aircraft generators alone reaching over 300 units. The Yunnan Mint currently has over 280,000 yuan of half-opened silver coins (four coins equaling one silver dollar), over 23,000 silver dollars, and 5,425 taels of gold.
