【Benbao Shanhaiguan Xun】Correspondent Liu Zhinong reported: Shanhaiguan United Middle School of Liaoxi Province has improved its teaching work this semester. First, the teaching of each subject has been strengthened with planning. At the beginning of the semester, the teaching teams of each subject summarized the teaching experience of last year, and after several discussions and revisions, they made written teaching improvement plans, determined and unified the purpose, progress, viewpoints, methods, and goals of each subject's teaching. For example, the teaching plan of the Chinese language department includes specific plans for pre-class preparation, classroom teaching, extracurricular guidance, composition problems, observation teaching, and learning problems. The teaching improvement plan of the mathematics department, in addition to summarizing the shortcomings of past teaching, such as unclear teaching objectives, insufficient focus on reality, little connection with reality, no use of teaching aids, and not enough universal grading of homework, specifically proposed clarifying teaching viewpoints and objectives in the improvement plan, paying attention to the connection of teaching in each grade; in terms of teaching methods, it proposed strengthening the study of application problems, making teaching aids as much as possible, and using teaching aids for physical teaching. The political study and teaching research activities of the teachers have also been stepped up. Teachers who were more complacent in the past have also realized: "If we don't work hard to improve ourselves, there is a real danger of falling behind the students." In actual work, each subject seems to have launched a competition.

Second, according to actual needs, each subject, under the leadership of teachers, used daily extracurricular activity time to make a batch of practical teaching tools. The mathematics group has made 30 kinds of wooden teaching aids such as square root extraction and square array problem explainers; the physics and chemistry group sorted out and installed 20 boxes of newly arrived instruments, and repaired old instruments such as distillers, hydraulic presses, vacuum pumps, Wimshurst machines, electric bells, and vacuum electric bells. They are now planning to install weather stations and models of submarines, trams, and water towers; the history group has drawn 28 kinds of historical application charts; the geography group has made models of the terrain of Northeast China and the Yellow River Basin, and drawn seven maps of China's mountain system, water system, and rainfall distribution. It plans to make 20 maps by the end of May, and add a national map model. In addition to guiding students to cultivate two small botanical gardens and plant 51 kinds of plants in 17 families, the biology group also led students to collect 79 kinds of plant specimens and 20 kinds of animal specimens during a trip. In addition, it also sorted out and mounted 70 biological and hygiene wall charts, and the real object slide projector has also been initially tested successfully. These teaching aids have been gradually used in classroom teaching, which has greatly helped students understand their lessons.

Third, each subject has conducted special research on grading homework. For example, the Chinese language group specifically studied the homework grading of two teachers. After everyone's discussion and criticism, there has been obvious progress. Irresponsible comments such as "clear and smooth wording, substantial meaning" and "disordered wording, not an article" and careless grading have gradually disappeared. Music, physical education, and other courses that had never had their notes graded in the past have also been universally graded this semester. The content of the notes in each course is also richer than in the past.

In addition, planned extracurricular activities have also been launched this semester. Under the leadership of the Extracurricular Activities Steering Committee, all 1,050 students in the school. About 700 people participate in entertainment and sports activities every day after school, and more than 300 people participate in labor to build the school (on a rotating basis). The students enthusiastically built courtyard walls, repaired ditches, planted 7,700 trees, and cultivated 26.5 mu of vegetable land. The teachers and staff living in the school also cultivated more than 10 mu of vegetable land, and have begun to eat the bok choy they planted themselves.

There are also some shortcomings in improving teaching work. For example, in emphasizing "improving teaching quality," some teachers regard improving teaching quality as contradictory to doing class teacher guidance work, so they ideologically despise and relax the class teacher work, so that the order of some classes failed to quickly enter the normal track at the beginning of the semester.

### 总结过去经验加强计划性  山海关联中改进教学工作　全体师生发挥竞赛精神

　　总结过去经验加强计划性
　  山海关联中改进教学工作           
　　全体师生发挥竞赛精神
    【本报山海关讯】通讯员刘稚农报道：辽西省立山海关联合中学，本期改进了教学工作。首先，各科的教学加强了计划性。各科教学小组在开学之初总结了去年的教学经验，并都经过数次讨论与修改作出了书面的教学改进方案和计划，确定并统一了各科教学的目的、进度、观点、方法和努力的目标。如国文科的教学计划中包括了课前准备、堂上教学、课外指导、作文问题、观摩教学、学习问题等方面的具体计划。数学科教学改进方案中，除总结了过去教学中存在的教学目的不明确、从实际出发不够、联系实际少、没有利用教具、批改作业不够普遍等缺点外，在改进计划中，具体地提出了明确教学观点及目的，注意各年级教学的联系；在教法上提出加强应用问题的学习，尽可能制作教具，利用教具作实物教学等。教员的政治学习和教学研究活动也加紧了，过去比较自满的教师，也已觉悟到：“如不努力提高自己，真有掉在同学后面的危险。”在实际工作中，各科好像展开了竞赛。
    第二，各科根据实际需要，在教师领导下，利用每日课外活动时间，作出了一批实用的教学工具。数学组已作出开平方、方阵问题说明器等三十种木制教具；理化组整理安装了新到仪器二十箱，并修理了蒸馏器、水压机、抽气机、韦氏起电机、电铃、真空电铃等旧仪器，现正计划安装气象台及潜水艇、电车、水塔等模型；历史组已绘制历史应用图表二十八种；地理组已制出了东北和黄河流域两处地形的模型，绘制了中国山脉系统、水系、雨量分布等地图七幅，计划在五月底作出二十幅，并增作一个全国地图模型。博物组除指导同学开垦两个小植物园，种植十七科五十一种植物外，并在一次旅行中领导同学采集植物标本七十九种，动物二十种，此外还整理裱糊了生物、卫生挂图七十幅，实物幻灯也已初步试验成功。这些教具，已逐渐运用在课堂教学上，对帮助同学理解功课起了很大作用。
    第三，在批改作业上，各科都作过专题研究。如国文组具体研究过两位教师的作业批改，经过大家讨论批判后，现已有了明显的进步。如“词句明顺，文意充实。”“词句杂乱，不成文章。”之类不负责任的批语和粗枝大叶的批改，已渐渐绝迹。音乐、体育等课程过去从未批改过笔记的，本期也都普遍批改了。各门课程的笔记，也比过去充实了内容。
    此外，本期来还展开了有计划的课外活动。在课外活动指导委员会的领导下，全校一千零五十人。每日课余约有七百人参加娱乐、体育等活动，三百余人参加劳动建校工作（各班轮流）。同学们热烈地垒院墙、修水沟，并植树七千七百棵，开垦菜地二十六亩五分。住校教职员也开垦了菜地十亩多，并已开始吃上自己种植的小白菜。
    在改进教学工作中，也存在若干缺点。如强调“提高教学质量”中，部分教师把提高教学质量与做级任辅导工作看成是矛盾的，因而在思想上轻视、放松了级任工作，以致有的班的秩序在开学之初未能很快进入正规。
