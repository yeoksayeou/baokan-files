Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th—Over 160 million mu of spring fields in East China have been largely cultivated. In the dryland areas north of the Yangtze River, including Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui, sowing was generally completed by early May, except for some flooded areas, and they are now shifting to summer weeding. In various parts of southern China, over 90 percent of the paddy fields have been sown two to three times, and cotton has also been sown in a timely manner. Zhejiang and southern Anhui have also reclaimed 400,000 mu of new wasteland. Most areas have now begun a concentrated effort for summer cultivation and rice transplanting. Fujian Province and Ningbo, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, and other areas in Zhejiang Province have successively completed early rice transplanting. This spring, sowing generally coincided with timely and thorough rains in most areas. Furthermore, various regions paid widespread attention to deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, processing and fertilization, and seed selection and soaking during spring plowing and sowing. As a result, the seedlings emerged uniformly and vigorously.

To help farmers smoothly carry out rice transplanting, the people's governments in various parts of southern China promptly provided a large amount of bean cake, fertilizer powder, gypsum, alum, and other fertilizers as loans. The Sunan Administrative Office has loaned 24 million jin of bean cake and 1 million jin of fertilizer powder. Before rice transplanting, the Ningbo Special Administrative Office in Zhejiang loaned 70,000 jin of alum and manure and bean cake worth 100,000 jin of rice to Yin County, which plants the most double-cropping rice. The southern Anhui Administrative Office also focused on distributing the 7 million jin of production loan grain approved by the East China Military and Political Committee to severely affected areas such as Wu(hu)-Dang(tu), Guichi, and Xuancheng to help disaster-stricken people transplant rice. With the fertilizer and grain loans, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. Farmers in various parts of Zhejiang Province generally applied fertilizer one more time to the seedling fields this year, and the planting of double-cropping rice has also increased more widely than in previous years. According to incomplete statistics from the four special districts of Shaoxing, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou alone, a total of over 3.38 million mu of double-cropping rice were planted this year. Among them, the double-cropping rice planting area in Shaoxing Special District increased by 26 percent compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th—Spring plowing and sowing work in the three provinces of Pingyuan, Hebei, and Shanxi is nearing completion. Due to the cold climate, cultivation in the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan is later, and sowing is currently being carried out intensely, and is expected to be completed by early June.

The entire Pingyuan Province had sown over 13 million mu of spring land by the end of April (including over 3.5 million mu of cotton). Before sowing, the four special districts of Anyang, Xinxiang, Puyang, and Liaocheng generally plowed once and harrowed twice.

Except for some flooded areas in disaster-stricken areas that have not yet been cultivated, spring land in Hebei Province has generally been plowed once to three times. It has now completed sowing over 70 million mu of spring land (including over 14 million mu of cotton). The sowing work in Shanxi Province can be completed before Mangzhong (June 6th). At present, 2 million mu of cotton have been sown. This province has reclaimed about 300,000 mu of wasteland this spring.

Most of the spring land in Chahar Province has been plowed once. In the Chanan Special District, 10 to 20 percent of the original bare land was largely cultivated by the end of April. In the Yanbei District, most of the spring land has been replowed. Due to timely spring rains in the province, farmers are now intensely carrying out sowing of field crops. Yanqing County had sown over 70 percent of the fields by the end of April. Wheat, oats, peas, and other crops in Chabei and Yanbei counties have been sown, and autumn crops such as millet and sorghum are also being sown, and are estimated to be completed by late May.

Suiyuan Province has now sown over 16.6 million mu, accounting for 65 percent of the province's spring cultivated land. This spring, the province has reclaimed a total of over 50,000 mu of wasteland.

　　华东春田播种完毕
　　出土禾苗均极齐壮
　　华北春播工作即将结束
    【新华社上海十八日电】华东区一亿六千余万亩春田已大致耕种完毕。长江以北地区的山东、苏北、皖北等旱田地区，除部分水淹地外，已于五月上旬普遍完成播种，现正转入夏锄。江南各地，百分之九十以上的稻田已播耕两遍至三遍，棉花亦已适时播种完毕。浙江、皖南并开新荒四十万亩。现大部地区已开始突击夏耕插秧。福建省及浙江省的宁波、绍兴、温州、嘉兴等地已先后完成早稻插秧。今年春季播种，大部地区均逢适时透雨，加之春耕播种中各地普遍注意了深耕细作、加工施肥及选种浸种等工作，禾苗出土后都极齐壮。
    江南各地人民政府为帮助农民顺利进行插秧，及时贷放了大批豆饼、肥田粉、石膏、明矾等肥料。苏南行署已贷放豆饼二千四百万斤，肥田粉一百万斤。浙江宁波专署于插秧前，以七万斤明矾及价值十万斤稻谷的人粪及豆饼贷给播种双季稻最多的鄞县。皖南行署并将华东军政委员会批拨的七百万斤生产贷粮，有重点地分配给芜（湖）当（涂）、贵池、宣城等重灾区，帮助灾民插秧。各地农民得到贷肥和贷粮后，生产积极性大增。浙江省各地农民今年的秧田普遍多施一次肥，种植双季稻亦较往年普遍增加。仅据绍兴，宁波、温州、台州四个专区不完全的统计，今年种植双季稻共三百三十八万余亩。其中绍兴专区今年双季稻种植面积较去年增加百分之二十六。
    【新华社十八日讯】平原、河北、山西三省春耕播种工作已接近完成，察哈尔、绥远两省因气候寒冷，耕种较晚，现正紧张进行播种，预计六月初亦可结束。
    平原全省于四月底已播种春地一千三百余万亩（内有棉花三百五十余万亩）。播种前，安阳、新乡、濮阳、聊城等四个专区一般都普犁了一遍，耙了两遍。
    河北省除灾区尚有一些水淹地未耕外，春地一般均普耕了一遍至三遍，现已完成播种春地七千余万亩（内有棉花一千四百余万亩），山西全省播种工作可在芒种（六月六日）前结束，现棉花已完成二百万亩的播种任务。该省今春共开荒地约三十万亩。
    察哈尔省大部春地已耕过一遍。察南专区原有白茬地百分之十至二十，四月底即已大部耕完。雁北区春地已大部进行复耕。该省由于春雨适时，现各地农民正紧张进行大田作物播种。延庆县在四月底已播种大田百分之七十以上。察北、雁北各县的小麦、燕麦、豌豆等已播种完毕，谷物、高粱等大秋作物亦正在播种，估计五月下旬也可播种完毕。
    绥远省现已播种一千六百余万亩，占该省春耕地百分之六十五。全省今春共开荒五万余亩。
