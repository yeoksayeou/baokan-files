　　Five Model Workers of Xinxiang Telecommunications Bureau

　　I. Not a Single Error
　　Comrade Liu Chuanxin, a telegraph reviewer at the Xinxiang Telecommunications Bureau, reviewed a total of 4,048 telegrams, processed 4,456 numbers, handled 654 official telegrams and return receipts, and bound 85 newspapers in forty days from March 11 to April 20 without a single error. Telegraph operator Shan Yongli said, "As long as Comrade Liu Chuanxin reviews our telegrams, there will be no more errors." At the "Celebrate Model Workers" conference, Comrade Liu Chuanxin himself said, "My work attitude is: first, meticulousness; second, humility; third, confidence."

　　II. Only One Character Wrong
　　Telegraph operator Zhu Changling, in forty days, sent and received a total of 27,322 characters in telegrams, with only one character wrong. All comrades in the telegraph room unanimously said, "We must respond to the call of the China Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union to 'eliminate errors.' Comrade Zhu Changling is our model, and we should all learn from him."

　　III. Saving 800 Jin of Gasoline Annually
　　Old worker Jia Shouting of the power room has been working for twenty years. In forty days, he repaired the power engine independently thirteen times, working a total of 523 hours. In the past, it took two and a half jin of gasoline per hour. He carefully studied and adjusted the air door and throttle to be well-coordinated. Now, he can save half a jin of gasoline per hour, saving 800 jin of gasoline annually. He also used waste materials to make two sets of screw plates and a switch, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient tools. At the "Celebrate Model Workers" conference, Comrade Jia Shouting himself said, "Now that we workers are in charge, we must work this way to build the country well."

　　IV. Stringing 4,800 Meters of Wire
　　Telephone worker Zhang Furun strung a total of 4,800 meters of wire and installed 19 telephones in forty days. In April, one day it rained heavily. Because a 100-pair cable on Xinhua Street in Xinxiang city was not sealed, if water leaked in, the entire cable section would be damaged. He automatically went out in the rain to seal the opening, protecting this section of the cable.

　　V. Astonishing Figures
　　Clerk Wei Zonghan, in forty days, wrote a total of 60,440 regular script and stencil characters and mimeographed 4,278 copies of reports. These astonishing figures are the result of his consistent active work. Talking less and doing more, being meticulous and hard-working, are his excellent work attitude and style. It has become his habit to often not go home for meals and to come early and leave late.

　　新乡电信局的五个工作模范
    一、没有发生一次错误
    新乡电信局电报复核员刘传新同志，自三月十一日至四月二十日四十天内，共复核电报四○四八封，理号四四五六张，处理公电和贴回单六五四封，装订报的八十五本，没有发生一次错误。报务员单永礼说：“我们的电报，只要有刘传新同志复核，就不会再有错误。”在“庆模”大会上，刘传新同志自己说：“我的工作态度是：第一是细心，第二是虚心，第三是信心。”
    二、仅错一个字
    报务员朱长龄同志，在四十天的时间内，共收发电报二七三二二个字，仅仅错了一个字。报房的全体同志一致说：“我们要响应中国邮电总工会“消灭差错”的号召。朱长龄同志是我们的模范，我们大家应向他学习。”
    三、全年可以节省汽油八百斤
    动力室的老工人贾寿亭同志，工龄已有二十年。他在四十天的时间内，单独修理动力机十三次。总共工作五二三小时。过去每小时用汽油二斤半。他细心研究，把风门和油门调整得很协配，现在，每小时能节省汽油半斤，全年可以节省汽油八百斤。他还利用废料做成了螺丝板二付和开关一只，克服了工具不够的困难。在“庆模”大会上，贾寿亭同志自己说：“现在我们工人当家做主人，大家就得这样干，把国家建设好。”
    四、架线四八○○公尺
    电话工人张福润同志，四十天内共架线四八○○公尺。按装电话一九部。四月间，有一天下大雨，因为新乡市内新华街有一处一○○对电缆没有封口，假如漏水进去，整段电缆就坏了，他自动冒雨去封好口，保护了这一段电缆。
    五、惊人的数字
    缮写员卫宗翰同志，在四十天内，缮写正楷字、钢板字共六○四四○个字。油印报表四二七八份。这惊人的数字，是他一贯积极工作的结果。少说多做，细心耐劳，是他优良的工作态度和作风。经常不回家吃饭，早来晚归，已成了他的习惯。
