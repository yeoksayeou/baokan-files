　　Learning from the Highly Responsible Spirit of the Employees of the Basumu Station on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway
	Between Basumu Station and Shibatai Station on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, there are many earth mountains on both sides of the railway, and the terrain is dangerous. All the employees of Basumu Station pay close attention to this section of the road. At about 7:00 PM on May 7th, Comrade Gao Zhifu, a track inspector at Basumu, was patrolling at 538 kilometers and 48 meters when he suddenly discovered three large stones placed on the right side of the railway track. One of them weighed about 100 kilograms, another about 40 kilograms, and the third about 30 kilograms, all leaning against the track. He immediately moved the stones away and continued to move forward.
	Returning to 538 kilometers and 300 meters, he saw a child coming from a small mountain path. He asked the child where he was coming from and going to, and asked the child if he had seen anyone else. The child said he saw two people go to the mountain over there, and when he passed by, the two people were still standing on the mountain, and later they were sitting in the stone pit. After our worker Comrade Gao Zhifu learned about the situation from the child, he felt very uneasy. He did not know where these three large stones came from; it might be bad people trying to sabotage the trains. He ran back to the station in one breath and reported the situation to the station master, and then reported to the foreman and track inspection team leader at the work area. It was already 8:25 PM. The station master immediately relayed the situation to the Pingdiquan Public Security Sub-bureau and the Datong Dispatching Office, and reported to the neighboring station to inform train No. 152.
	In order to ensure the punctual operation of the train and prevent any accidents, the station also gathered the patrol team to re-inspect the area at 538 kilometers. They set off at 9:30 PM. Trade union director Wang Shigui, patrol team leader Zhang Mingzhi, deputy station master Dong Ganglong, track inspection team leader Jia Li, and Qian Fu and five other people, carrying six rifles, traveled to 537 kilometers and then split into two groups. One person carried a hand signal lamp and proceeded along the railway; Comrade Wang Shigui and five other people went through the mountains to search the hilltop where the stones were originally placed. That day there was a strong yellow wind, and it was night, so people could not see each other. Comrade Wang Shigui only cared about searching forward and accidentally fell into a ditch more than four meters deep and fainted. Comrades Qian Fu and two others helped Wang Shigui back. Dong Ganglong and two others continued to move forward to search, and found nothing at the ditch entrance. It was already 11:30 PM. After passenger train No. 152 passed safely, the comrades returned to the station. It was already 1:30 AM. After Wang Shigui was injured, the doctor at the Pingdiquan clinic examined and applied medicine, and the wound has gradually healed. Comrade Wang has always been active in his work, especially in the work of the patrol team and the trade union, and is very responsible. After falling into the deep ditch, as soon as he woke up, he asked: Is there a problem on the track? Has the train passed? This fully demonstrated his serious and responsible spirit towards his work. The other five comrades also showed a high degree of responsibility to the people's railway.

　　学习京绥路八苏木站员工对工作的高度负责精神
    京绥路八苏木至十八台两车站之间，铁路两侧有很多土山，地势险恶。八苏木站全体员工对这段路是非常注意的。五月七日下午七点钟左右，八苏木查道工友高治富同志巡查至五三八公里四十八公尺处，突发现铁路钢轨右侧上放有大石头三块。其中一块约有一百公斤，另一块约有四十公斤，还有一块约三十公斤，都靠在钢轨上。他立即将石头搬去，继续前进。
    返回至五三八公里三百公尺处，他看见一个小孩由山上小道走来。他就问小孩由那儿来到那儿去，并向小孩询问看见别的人没有。小孩说看见两个人到那边山上去了，他过来的时候那两人还在山上站着，后来就坐在石头坑里边了。我们的工友高治富同志从小孩口中了解情况后，心里非常不安。他不知道这三块大石头是从什么地方来的；也可能是坏人捣鬼，企图破坏往来的列车。他一口气跑回站上将情况报告站长，又回工区报告工长与查道组长。这时已是下午八点二十五分了。站长当将情况转报平地泉公安分所、大同调度所，并报告邻站转告一五二次列车。
    为了保证列车正点运行，不出任何事故，站上又召集了纠查队前往五三八公里处复查。于九时三十分出发。工会主任王世贵、纠查队长张明志、副站长董刚龙、查道组长贾理及钱福等六个人，携步枪六枝，行至五三七公里处即分为两路前进。一人携手信号灯顺铁路前进；王世贵同志等五个人穿山奔向原放石头处的山顶搜索。这天正刮大黄风，又是黑夜，对面看不见人。王世贵同志只顾向前搜查，不慎失足，跌到四丈余深的沟内，昏了过去。钱福等二同志将王世贵同志扶着回来。董刚龙等二人继续前进搜索，行至沟口未发现情况。这时已是夜里十一点三十分了。一五二次旅客列车安全的通过以后，几个同志即返回本站。这时已是深夜一点三十分了。王世贵同志受伤后，经平地泉分诊所医生检查上药，伤口已渐痊愈。王同志的工作一贯积极，尤其是对纠查队与工会工作更是热心负责。在跌入深沟以后，他一醒过来就问：道上有问题没有？车过去了没有？充分表现了他对工作的认真负责精神。其他五个同志也都表现了对人民铁道的高度负责的精神。
