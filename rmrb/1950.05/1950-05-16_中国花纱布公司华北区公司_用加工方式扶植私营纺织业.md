　　China National Cotton Yarn Cloth Company North China District Company
　　Supports Private Textile Industry Through Processing Methods

    [Reported by our newspaper] Reporter Kang Weizhong reports: Since March of this year, the North China District Company of the China National Cotton Yarn Cloth Company has been supporting the private textile industry in various parts of North China through processing methods. In the current situation where many factories are facing difficulties in sales, this has ensured the normal production of the private textile industry.

    According to statistics: From early March, private spinning mills in Tianjin such as Hengyuan, Beiyang, Dasheng, and the public-private joint venture Huaxin in Tangshan, as well as the private Daxing Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang (which continued processing after being returned to private ownership last year), have all successively implemented processing, solving the problem of production and sales. As a result, all 100,400 spindles in private spinning mills in North China have been running without interruption. According to statistics for the entire month of April, the North China Cotton Yarn Cloth Company supplied various factories with 2.1 million jin of raw cotton, and recovered more than 4,000 bales of yarn and more than 75,000 bolts of cloth through processing. A large quantity of cotton yarn also serves as an abundant raw material for processing weaving. At the same time, a certain profit margin is appropriately guaranteed for each factory in production (a payment of 215 jin of cotton is paid for each bale of yarn processed, with 410 jin of raw cotton supplied, totaling an exchange ratio of 625 jin for each bale of yarn), which has given play to the production enthusiasm of both labor and management. Some factories with better production can obtain a net profit equivalent to about 30 jin of cotton for each bale of yarn processed. Yarn factories can obtain a profit of about 5% for each bale of yarn produced. Since raw material supply and product sales have been resolved, and there are no difficulties in capital turnover, wages can also be paid on time in various factories. The production enthusiasm of workers has also been unprecedentedly improved. In April, the unit output of Hengyuan Yarn Factory was 2% higher than in March. The yarn output of Beiyang Yarn Factory in April increased by 10.6% compared to March. More importantly, with the joint efforts of labor and management and the timely guidance of the Cotton Yarn Cloth Company, product quality has also improved compared to the past. For example, Tianjin Dasheng Yarn Factory used to produce mostly 20-count doubled yarn with poor quality and slow sales, but after processing, the Cotton Yarn Cloth Company requested improvements in quality, and the factory also began to engage in improvements.

    The Cotton Yarn Cloth Company not only supports large-scale private textile industries through processing methods, but also supports small-scale textile industries in urban and rural areas of North China. Especially in disaster areas, it has extensively combined with local cooperatives to organize textile handicraft production, which has played a certain role in helping the masses in disaster areas to produce and save themselves (supplying cooperatives with more than 1,000 bales of cotton yarn per month, not including the organization of textile production in disaster areas). According to statistics for April alone, the company directly exchanged yarn for cloth to support 1,555 electric looms (most of which are in Tianjin) and 6,195 manual looms (3,800 of which are in disaster areas) in cities such as Tianjin, Beijing, and Taiyuan, as well as vast rural areas. It delivered 3,379 bales of various yarns each month, producing 124,000 bolts of cloth. The processing fee for each 12-pound bolt of cloth is 40 jin of millet or corn flour. Based on this calculation, the company allocates the equivalent of 4.2 million jin of millet to producers (and more importantly, disaster victims) each month. With 40 jin per person per month, it guarantees the lives of 120,000 people each month.

    Recently, the North China Cotton Yarn Cloth Company pointed out in its review work that there are still many shortcomings in supporting the private textile industry through processing. First of all, there is a lack of planning and accurate economic accounting, which has led to the blind initiation and support of some backward manual textile industries in non-disaster areas that themselves lack the conditions for existence, resulting in the company's unsalable finished products; and each bolt needs to lose more than 30,000 yuan based on current market prices. At the same time, in the organization of processing work, some staff members still have bureaucratic work styles, lack research on procedures such as receiving cloth and paying yarn, and sometimes the lack of flexible capital operation prevents the timely allocation of processing fees, which has caused some difficulties for the private textile industry. Especially in supporting the dyeing and weaving industry, the repeated changes in plans have increased many difficulties for the private dyeing and weaving industry. The company decided to adopt a policy of continuing to support electric looms, while gradually converting some manual looms in non-disaster areas to other industries, in order to restore and develop the mechanical textile industry with emphasis. It will also continue to support the Tianjin and Beijing dyeing and finishing industries that are facing the off-season (more than 20,000 bolts of cloth were processed and dyed in April, allowing some factories to continue operating).

### 中国花纱布公司华北区公司　用加工方式扶植私营纺织业

　　用加工方式扶植私营纺织业
    【本报讯】记者康伟中报道：中国花纱布公司华北区公司自今年三月起，以加工方式扶植华北各地私营纺织工业，在目前不少工厂面临销路困难情况下，使私营纺织业得到了正常生产的保障。
    据统计：三月上旬天津的恒源、北洋、大生，唐山公私合营的华新等私营纺纱厂，和石家庄私营大兴纱厂（该厂去年发还后仍继续进行加工），都先后实行加工，解决了产销问题。因而整个华北私营纺纱厂十万零四千余锭子，并未间断地转动起来。据四月份全月统计，华北花纱布公司供给各厂原料棉达二百一十万斤，加工收回纱四千余件、布七万五千余匹。且有大批棉纱作为加工织布的充裕原料。同时在加工中也适当保证了各厂生产上的一定利润（每件纱付工缴折棉二百一十五斤，原料棉四百一十斤，共折合每件纱六百二十五斤的交换比率），发挥了劳资双方生产积极性。有些生产较好的厂子，每件纱加工可得纯益约折合三十斤棉花。纱厂生产每件纱可得百分之五左右利润。由于原料供应、产品销售均已解决，资金周转也无困难，因此各厂对工薪亦都能按时发放。职工生产积极性也空前提高。四月份恒源纱厂单位产量较三月份高出百分之二。北洋纱厂四月份纱产量较三月份提高百分之十点六。更重要的，是在劳资双方协力和花纱布公司及时的指导下，产品质量也较前提高。如天津大生纱厂，过在多生产二十支合股线，质量差，销路迟滞，但经加工后，花纱布公司要求改进质量，厂方也开始从事改进。
    花纱布公司不仅以加工方式扶植规模较大的私营纺织工业，且对华北区城乡小型的纺织业亦加以扶植，特别在灾区曾广泛地结合各地合作社组织纺织手工业生产，对灾区群众生产自救，曾起到一定作用（供给合作社每月棉纱一千余件，组织灾区纺织尚不在内）。仅据四月份统计，公司直接以纱换布扶植天津、北京、太原等城市及广大农村的电力机一千五百五十五台（电力机多在天津），人力机六千一百九十五台（其中三千八百台是在灾区），每月交付各种纱三千三百七十九件，生产布达十二万四千匹。每匹十二磅布加工费小米或玉米面四十斤。以此计算，每月就拨给生产者（更重要的是灾民）相当四百二十万斤小米，每人每月所需以四十斤计，每月就保证了十二万人的生活。
    最近华北花纱布公司在检讨工作中曾提出：加工扶植私营纺织工业上尚存在不少缺点。首先是缺乏计划性，缺乏精确经济核算，以致对某些非灾区的、本身早已缺乏存在条件的落后手工纺织，亦曾加以盲目发动和扶植，造成了公司方面成品滞销的毛病；且每匹按目前市价计算须赔钱三万元以上。同时在组织加工工作中，某些工作人员还存在着官僚主义作风，对收布付纱等手续缺乏研究，且有时因资金运转不够灵活，不能及时拨付加工费用等均曾给私营纺织工业一些困难。特别是在扶植染织业方面，因计划几经改变，给私营染织业增加不少困难。该公司决定采取继续扶植电力机，而对部分非灾区人力机则采取逐步使其转业的方针，以便有重点地恢复与发展机械纺织工业。并对面临淡月的天津、北京染整业继续扶植（四月份曾加工染布两万余匹，部分工厂得以继续开工）。
