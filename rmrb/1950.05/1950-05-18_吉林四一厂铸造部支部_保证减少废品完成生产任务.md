　　Jilin No. 41 Factory Foundry Branch
　  Guarantee Reduction of Defective Products and Completion of Production Tasks
　　Jilin Municipal Party Committee Organization Department
    The foundry department of Jilin No. 41 Factory is one of the most important departments in the factory's production process. After accepting the task of manufacturing liberation-style waterwheels for the Central Ministry of Agriculture in late March, the department's position in production became even more important, as the main parts of the waterwheels were cast by this department. However, this department used to be the weakest link in the entire factory. In March, not only was the quantity of products small (only about 40 units per day), failing to meet demand, but the quality was also too poor, with defective products reaching 43.6%. In individual groups, defective products even reached over 85%. Even in the Liu Zhengde group, which had better quality, defective products accounted for 33.1%. This situation was reversed in April. At the beginning of April, the daily output of waterwheels was 54 units, and after the 20th, it increased to 120 units, more than doubling. The quality was also greatly improved. From April to the 26th, defective products accounted for only 12.8%. The task of 1,600 waterwheels was basically completed on the 24th.
    In the process of rapid production increase and rapid quality improvement in the foundry department, the branch's guarantee and supervision of production played an important role.
    After the production task for April was issued, the branch, based on the general branch's April plan and instructions on cultivating model examples, first discussed within the branch committee what slogans should be put forward and what work should be done. It was decided that in order to complete the task and create a new record of improving quality, each party member should unite two members of the masses, the trade union should be arranged to do a good job in publicity, and a contact contract should be signed. The Youth League should sign a master-apprentice contract. After the branch committee discussed the preliminary plan, it convened a branch general meeting to discuss the production plan. With the party members feeling confident, a workshop staff meeting and trade union group meetings were held repeatedly to discuss the plan, so that the workers also had a clear understanding. During the discussion of the plan, the workers were confident of completing the plan. However, the workers suggested that the large and small helical gear models were not enough, the machine frame core head was biased, the iron water force was large, making it easy to produce defective products, the water turbine model was thick on one side and thin on the other and also heavy, and the machine frame sand box used a cross belt, wasting four or five minutes each time, which would be better with a horizontal belt. At the same time, suggestions were made that there were too few sieves and the lead powder was not good. The branch, together with the trade union, raised these reasonable opinions to the administration, and most of them were resolved, preparing conditions for the successful completion of the April plan.
    When starting to make waterwheels, defective products accounted for almost half. The workers were unhappy, some lost confidence and feared that they could not complete the task, some complained that the inspection department's inspection was too strict, and even individual workers wanted to hit the comrades in the inspection department. After the branch understood the situation, it found that the poor quality was not due to overly strict inspection, but because the workers generally had a complacent attitude in their thinking (of course, there were other reasons, such as only pursuing quantity, etc.), thinking that "this thing is very simple, you can do it with your eyes closed! I've done lathes, what's a waterwheel," resulting in carelessness in their work. Fang Shuchun even forgot to put the core in the two large gears he made. After studying these situations, the branch decided that on the one hand, it was necessary to cultivate a model group that improves quality to set an example, and on the other hand, to first conduct education within the party among the workers, opposing negligence. Based on the general branch's opinion, the slogan "increase quantity on the basis of quality first" was put forward. At the same time, it was widely publicized that making waterwheels was a political task, to support the farmers in Guanli in their struggle against drought, so that the workers knew the importance of making waterwheels. Propaganda was also carried out on the blackboard newspaper, thus changing the workers' bad tendency of complacency and carelessness. In early April, the task of 72 units per day was achieved, but it still could not meet the needs of the Machinery Department and the Special Machinery Department. On the 12th, a branch general meeting was convened, putting forward the slogan "Strive to complete the task of 85 waterwheels," and "Guarantee supply to the Machinery Department and the Assembly Department," and a contact contract was signed with the Machinery and Special Machinery Departments together with the trade union. After the quality was improved, the defective products were also significantly reduced, and the branch called out: "Guarantee the completion of 100 units, reducing defective products to 10%." These slogans were based on the specific and key problems existing at the time, and were able to mobilize the broad masses to strive for the thorough realization of the slogans.
    Based on the instructions of the general branch, the branch committee decided to cultivate the three groups of Mi Wenshan, Liu Zhengde, and Xiao Fengge as models separately. Among them, the Mi Wenshan group had the most party members (party and league members accounted for seven out of fourteen people), so the branch focused on this group. The leader of the group, Mi Wenshan, was a party member, willing to work hard, and sometimes secretly worked overtime until very late before going home, his eyes were exhausted. However, he had few leadership methods and a bad temper. As soon as he heard that he was going to cultivate their group as a "model," he became anxious. As soon as he became anxious, he got angry, and as soon as he got angry, he wanted to lose his temper. The deputy leader, Li Linbin (non-party member), did not do much work, and there was disunity with Mi Wenshan, and the workers also had opinions, so this group was not successfully cultivated. The branch then shifted its focus to the Liu Zhengde group. This time, accepting the lessons of the failure to cultivate the Mi Wenshan group, the branch first carefully understood the situation of the group. When it was understood that Liu Zhengde understood the problem quickly and had prestige, although the technical conditions of the group were not very high and there were few party members (only two), the group was united, so it was decided to concentrate efforts to cultivate it. Branch Secretary Rong Jing often went to the Liu group to understand the situation and solve problems. If a small achievement was found, it was immediately praised. There was news about them on the blackboard newspaper every time. They worked very hard, and as a result, from April 1st to 6th, they created a new record of reducing defective products to 7%, and the quantity exceeded the quota of nine units, reaching twelve units. On the 5th, the factory issued a notice praising them. On the 10th, the factory held a general meeting and awarded the Liu Zhengde group 5 million yuan in bonuses. All departments and sections wrote congratulatory letters and took pictures of the Liu Zhengde group. On the 11th, a branch general meeting was held, praising Liu Zhengde, putting forward the slogan "Learn from the Liu Zhengde group," and writing this slogan on a banner and posting it in the Liu group's work area. Because a model group that improved quality was cultivated and appropriate rewards were given, other groups were deeply stimulated and promoted, so that the defective products were reduced from about 50% in March to 15.34% on April 7th.
    The branch has made many achievements in the work of cultivating model examples. However, it has done a poor job in adopting various methods to promote the experience of the model group in a timely manner. As a result, some groups were not convinced by the Liu Zhengde group, thinking that it was "a lucky coincidence" and "good luck," and some even held an attitude of attacking and satirizing. Therefore, the branch must also learn to be good at using model examples to guide the overall situation, so as to improve the production of the entire workshop a step further.
    (Editor's note: When cultivating the Mi Wenshan group, the focus should not be shifted immediately because of Mi Wenshan's temper and disunity within the group. The focus should be on patiently helping Mi Wenshan overcome his shortcomings and solve the unity problem within the group, so that the role of improving production can be truly brought into play, and the purpose of cultivating model examples can be achieved, so as not to form the shortcoming of being a model for the sake of being a model.)

### 吉林四一厂铸造部支部  保证减少废品完成生产任务

　　吉林四一厂铸造部支部
　  保证减少废品完成生产任务
　　吉林市委组织部
    吉林市四一厂铸造部是该厂生产过程中最重要的部门之一。三月下旬开始接受为中央农业部制造解放式水车任务后，该部在生产中的地位就更加重要，因为水车的主要机件都由该部铸造。但该部过去是全厂最薄弱的一环，三月份产品不但数量少（日产仅四十台左右）供不上，而且质量太差，废品竟达百分之四三·六，个别组废品曾达到百分之八五以上。质量较好的刘正德小组，废品亦占百分之三三·一。四月份扭转了这个局面。四月初日产水车五十四台，二十日以后增加到一二○台，提高一倍以上。质量亦大大的提高。四月份到二十六日止废品仅占百分之一二·八。一、六○○台水车任务在二十四日即基本完成。
    铸造部在生产飞快提高，质量迅速好转的过程中，支部对生产的保证与监督曾起了重要的作用。
    四月份的生产任务下来后，支部根据总支四月计划及培养典型的指示，首先在支委内讨论应该提出什么口号？作那些工作？决定为了完成任务创造提高质量的新纪录，一个党员要团结二个群众，布置工会作好宣传工作，订立联系合同，青年团要订立师徒合同。支委讨论初步方案后，召开支部大会，讨论生产计划。党员心里有底了，又召开车间职工大会及工会小组会反复讨论，使得工友心里也有了数。在讨论计划中，工友都有信心完成计划。但工友提出大小斜齿轮的样子不够用，机架样子芯子头偏，铁水力量大，就容易产生废品，水簸箕样子一面厚一面薄而且还重，机架砂箱用十字带，每个会浪费四、五分钟，不如用横带，同时又提出筛子少，铅粉不好等建议，支部把这些合理的意见，协同工会提到行政，大部取得解决。给顺利完成四月份的计划准备了条件。
    开始做水车时，废品差不多占一半。工人不高兴，有的失掉信心怕完不成任务，有的瞒怨检验科检查太严，甚至个别工友要打检验科的同志。经过支部了解后，发现质量不好，不是由于检查过严，而是因为工人在思想上普遍存在自满情绪（当然也有其他原因，如只追求数量等），以为“这个玩艺很简单，闭着眼也能做！车床子都做过，水车算啥”，结果干活大意。房树春作的二个大齿轮竟忘了下芯子。支部研究了这些情况后，决定一方面要培养提高质量的典型小组作出样子，另方面在工人中首先在党内进行教育，反对疏忽大意。并根据总支的意见提出：在质量第一的基础上提高数量的口号。同时广泛的宣传作水车是政治任务，是为了支援关里农民与旱灾作斗争，使工友知道作水车的重要意义。黑板报上也进行宣传。因而转变了工友们自满粗心的不好倾向。四月上旬每天七二台的任务是达到了，但仍供不上机械部和特机部用。十二日召集支部大会，提出“为完成八十五台水车任务努力”、“保证供上机械部和装配部用”的口号，并协同工会与机械、特机二部订了联系合同。质量提高以后，废品也相当减少，支部又号召：“保证完成一○○台，废品降低到百分之一○”。这些口号是根据当前存在的具体而又是关键的问题，是能够动员广大群众为口号的彻底实现而努力的。
    支委根据总支指示，决定分头培养米文山、刘正德、萧凤阁三个小组作为典型。其中米文山组党员最多（十四人中党团员即占七人），支部就以这个组作为重点。正组长米文山是党员，工作肯干，自己有时偷偷的加班很晚才回家，眼都熬烂了。但领导办法少，脾气又暴，一听说要培养他们这组作“样子”就着急，一着急就上火，一上火就要发脾气。副组长李林斌（非党员）作活不多，与米文山又闹不团结，工友也闹意见，结果这个组没有培养成功。支部又把重点转到刘正德小组。这次接受培养米文山组的失败教训，首先仔细了解该组情况，当了解到刘正德体会问题快，有威信，该组技术条件虽不太高，党员也很少（只有二人），但组内团结，就决定集中力量予以培养。支书荣静同志经常到刘组了解情况解决问题，发现有一点小成绩马上表扬。黑板报上每次都有他们的消息。他们干的挺起劲，结果四月一日到六日创造了废品减少至百分之七的新纪录，数量超过了九台的定额达到十二台。五日工厂通令表扬。十日工厂开大会发给刘正德小组五○○万元的奖金。各科、部都写贺信，给刘正德小组照像。十一日开支部大会，表扬了刘正德，提出“向刘正德小组看齐”的口号，并把这个口号写成标语贴在刘组工作的地方。由于培养出提高质量的典型小组并进行了适当的奖励，深深地刺激与推动了其他小组，使废品由三月的百分之五○左右降低到四月七日的百分之一五·三四。
    支部在培养典型的工作上是作出了不少成绩的。但采用各种办法及时推广典型组的经验方面则作的较差。结果有些组对刘正德小组不服气，认为是“碰上点了”是“走时气”，有的甚至抱着打击讽刺的态度。因而支部还必须学会善于运用典型指导全面，才能将整个车间的生产提高一步。
    （编者按：在培养米文山小组时，不应因米文山的发脾气，组内的不团结而即转移重点，应耐心地帮助米文山克服缺点，解决组内的团结问题，才真正能够发扬提高生产的作用，而达到培养典型的目的，才不会形成“碰上点了”的为典型而典型的缺点。）
