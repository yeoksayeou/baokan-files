　　UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie Visits Europe
    To Resolve Paralysis Caused by US-UK Bloc's Refusal to Allow China to Attend
    [Xinhua News Agency, 8th] UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, accompanied by UN Assistant Secretary-General G.P. Saksin, left UN Headquarters in New York on April 22 for Europe. He arrived in London on April 28, meeting with Minister of State Younger, who is acting as Foreign Secretary in place of the sick Bevin. He arrived in Paris on April 29, meeting with French President Vincent Auriol and Prime Minister Georges Bidault. He arrived in The Hague on May 5, meeting with Dutch Foreign Minister Dirk Stikker. According to Trygve Lie's announcement in Paris on May 3, he will continue his visit to Geneva on the 6th and is scheduled to go to Moscow on May 10 to meet with Soviet government leaders. Before going to Europe, Trygve Lie visited Washington on April 20 and met with US President Harry Truman.
    According to reports from the US, British, and French bourgeois news agencies and Trygve Lie's own explanations, the main purpose of Trygve Lie's series of activities is to consult with the governments of the US, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, attempting to resolve the current paralysis of the United Nations. This state is caused by the unreasonable refusal of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States to allow the delegation of the People's Republic of China to attend the United Nations.
    Since our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai telegraphed the United Nations on November 15 last year, requesting the expulsion of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique and immediately appointed our representative to the United Nations, the delegations of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries have firmly supported this in the meetings of various UN agencies, demanding the expulsion of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique representatives. However, US imperialism, with the endorsement of the British representative, manipulated the majority to continue to retain the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique representatives, arbitrarily refusing our representative to attend. In order to express their solemn protest, the delegations of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries have successively withdrawn from twenty-five UN agencies. As a result, the UN agencies are in a state of paralysis because of this illegal action by the US-UK bloc.
    During this period, UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie attempted to remedy this abnormal state and issued a memorandum to the members of the Security Council on March 7. Although Trygve Lie did not criticize the US-UK bloc's actions that violated the Charter in this memorandum, he also believed that the issue of a government's right to representation in the United Nations should be separated from the issue of whether the government has established diplomatic relations with member governments. A government's right to representation in the United Nations should be determined in accordance with Article 4 of Chapter II of the United Nations Charter, based on whether it actually possesses the status of using national resources and guiding the people to fulfill the obligations of member states. Trygve Lie proposed that UN member states should take collective action to determine the issue of China's right to representation in the United Nations based on the above principles. However, these intentions of Trygve Lie failed to produce any positive results due to the US-UK bloc's stubborn adherence to its illegal actions. Therefore, Trygve Lie decided to personally visit the heads of major governments, attempting to seek a solution again.

　　联合国秘书长赖伊访欧
    图解决美英集团因拒绝我国出席而造成的瘫痪状态
    【新华社八日讯】联合国秘书长赖伊于四月二十二日偕同联合国助理秘书长辛琴科离纽约联合国总部赴欧，于四月二十八日抵伦敦，与在贝文病假中代理外交大臣职务的国务大臣杨格会晤，于四月二十九日抵巴黎，与法国总统阿里奥尔、总理皮杜尔会晤，于五月五日抵海牙，与荷兰外长斯蒂克会晤。据赖伊五月三日在巴黎宣布，他将继续于六日访问日内瓦，并定于五月十日赴莫斯科，与苏联政府首长会晤。赖伊在赴欧以前曾于四月二十日赴华盛顿与美国总统杜鲁门会晤。
    据美、英、法三国资产阶级通讯社的报道与赖伊本人的解释，赖伊这一连串活动的主要目的，在与美、英、法、苏四国政府会商，企图解决联合国目前的瘫痪状态，这种状态是由于以美国为首的帝国主义集团无理拒绝中华人民共和国代表团出席联合国而造成的。
    自从去年十一月十五日我外交部周恩来部长致电联合国要求开除国民党反动残余集团，并随即派定我驻联合国代表以后，苏联及波、捷等国代表团即在联合国各项机构会议中，坚决予以支持，要求开除国民党反动残余集团代表。但是美帝国主义在英国代表的附和下，操纵多数，继续保留国民党反动残余集团代表，蛮横地拒绝我代表出席。苏联及波、捷等国代表团为了表示严正的抗议起见，先后从二十五个联合国机构中退出。这样，联合国机构就因为美英集团这种非法行动而处于瘫痪状态中。
    在此期间，联合国秘书长赖伊曾企图挽回此种不正常状态，并于三月七日向安理会各会员国发出备忘录一件。赖伊在该备忘录中对美英集团违反宪章的行动虽未予以任何批驳，但他同时认为一国政府在联合国的代表权问题应与该国政府与会员国政府有无建立外交关系问题分开，一国政府在联合国的代表权应根据联合国宪章第二章第四条之规定，视其是否事实上据有使用国家资源及指导人民以履行会员国义务的地位而定。赖伊提出：联合国会员国应该采取集体行动，根据上述原则，决定中国出席联合国代表权的问题。但赖伊这些意图由于美英集团蛮横坚持其非法行动而未能产生任何积极结果，因此赖伊决定亲自访问各大国政府首脑，企图再次寻求解决的途径。
