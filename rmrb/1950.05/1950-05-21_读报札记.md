Reading Newspaper Notes

    The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions wrote a letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to appeal for relief for unemployed workers in Shanghai, which was published in the People's Daily on April 17 (hereinafter referred to as a). On the same day, the People's Daily published a short commentary entitled "Relief for Unemployed Workers in Shanghai" (hereinafter referred to as b). Later, on April 22, the People's Daily published a circular from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions calling on workers across the country to provide relief to unemployed workers in Shanghai (hereinafter referred to as c), which was largely rewritten based on the first two documents. Subsequently, on April 24, the People's Daily published a notice from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on commemorating "May Day" (hereinafter referred to as d), which also contained a passage with wording roughly similar to the relevant passages in the previous documents, regarding the current economic difficulties. Comparing these four documents can provide some insight into grammar and rhetoric. Now, I can only take two paragraphs as examples.

    The following paragraph is shared only by (a) and (c):

    (a) Since the Kuomintang bandit planes indiscriminately bombed Shanghai on February 6, destroying the electricity supply, the unemployment situation in Shanghai has become even more serious. Up to now, according to preliminary statistics, the number of unemployed workers has exceeded 150,000, and including their families, it is no less than 500,000. The lives of unemployed workers are already very difficult. It is a very common phenomenon to live on thin porridge, and the number of those who fill their stomachs with bean dregs, bean cakes, chaff, and wild vegetables is increasing daily. Cases of being evicted by landlords for being unable to afford rent are heard everywhere.

    (c) Recently, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions issued an urgent appeal for relief for unemployed workers in Shanghai, telling us how difficult a critical juncture the worker brothers and sisters in Shanghai are facing. 150,000 of them have fallen into unemployment, and counting their families, nearly 500,000, their lives are very difficult, some living on thin soup and porridge, and some filling their stomachs with bean dregs, bean cakes, chaff, and wild vegetables.

    First of all, we find that the length of the sentences is very different. (a) has five sentences, and (c), in addition to omitting the fifth sentence, combines the remaining four sentences into one. The first sentence has different wording because the starting point is different, but the "initiation" function is the same. Each of the five sentences in (a) has a single meaning, which is very clear. The long sentence in (c) inevitably contains too much, which is a common problem in writing today. A period can be placed after "critical juncture", a period can be placed after "unemployment", and ":" can be used after "difficult". (a) breaks the sentence here because the following two sentences describe the hardships of food and housing separately.)

    Secondly, (c) uses two parallel "some" to describe, which cannot show the difference in the degree of hardship between "bean dregs..." and "porridge". Changing "porridge" to "thin soup and porridge" also makes a slight difference. Writing "度日(dù rì, passing the day)" as "渡日(dù rì, crossing the day)" is a typo. The "陷于(xiàn yú, fall into)" in "陷于失业(xiàn yú shīyè, fallen into unemployment)" can be omitted. Using "困难的(kùnnán de, difficult)" to describe "严重关头(yánzhòng guāntóu, critical juncture)" is a bit puzzling, and seems not as good as "处在如何严重的困难之中(chǔ zài rúhé yánzhòng de kùnnán zhī zhōng, be in such serious difficulties)". These are all shortcomings of (c) compared to (a). The "以(yǐ, with)" and "喝(hē, drink)" in "(a) 以喝粥汤度日(yǐ hē zhōu tāng dù rì, living on thin porridge)" can be omitted; compared with the second half of the sentence, it is better to omit "喝(hē)" and keep "以(yǐ)".

    Another passage is common to all four documents:

    (a) Nevertheless, unemployed workers deeply understand the current difficulties of the country and the reasons for their occurrence, and know that the severity of the unemployment situation is mainly due to the long-term blockade and continuous bombing by the US imperialists and Chiang bandits.

    (b) Today, due to the blockade and bombing of Shanghai by the remnants of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries and bandits, due to the reduced purchasing power of farmers due to disasters in some rural areas and seasonal restrictions, and due to the reorganization and changes in the national economy caused by price stability, some industrial and commercial enterprises that have been speculating through inflation for twelve years and are not beneficial to the national livelihood have declared bankruptcy, resulting in a portion of workers temporarily falling into unemployment and underemployment.

    (c) We know that the main reasons for this difficult situation are: the long-term blockade and continuous bombing by US imperialism and the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits; the great reduction in farmers' purchasing power due to the destruction of the vast rural areas by long-term war and the impact of disasters in some rural areas last year; the inevitable decline of those industrial and commercial sectors that used to cater exclusively to the enjoyment of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie; and especially the fact that prices, which have been rising and fluctuating continuously for twelve years, have become stable today, making it impossible for some industrial and commercial enterprises that rely on speculation to maintain themselves and declare bankruptcy, etc.

    (d) However, due to the extreme hatred of the Chiang bandit remnants, desperately supported by US imperialism, for the victory of the Chinese people, they attempt to destroy the fruits of our victory by crazy means such as blockade and bombing, in order to achieve their dying struggle and prolong their lives; due to the destruction of the vast rural areas by long-term war, coupled with the severe floods suffered in many areas last year, and the fact that land reform has not yet been carried out, the purchasing power of the vast number of farmers is very low; due to the inevitable decline of some industrial and commercial sectors that originally catered to the corrupt enjoyment of imperialism, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and feudal landlords, coupled with the recent price stability, which has created unfavorable conditions for some speculative industrial and commercial operators who have always relied on inflation for profit, the phenomenon of some factories and shops stopping work and business has occurred. All of this has created economic difficulties for our country and increased the suffering of unemployment for some of our workers and staff.

    This passage explains the reasons for the current difficult situation. Here, (a) is the original document, which is particularly simple, only pointing out that this situation is mainly due to blockade and bombing. (b) seems to think that the statement in (a) is too simple, so it lists three reasons with three "due to": blockade and bombing, low rural purchasing power, and the bankruptcy of speculative industrial and commercial enterprises due to price stability. (c) and (b) were written after (d), and both added an item: the inevitable decline of a certain type of consumer industrial and commercial enterprises. However, (c) lists this as a separate item, so it uses four "due to" in total; (d) merges this newly added item into the third item, using "coupled with" instead of another "due to". This is a rough comparison of the content. Now we want to compare their presentation.

    All four paragraphs of text use the structure of "due to...", so we might as well first study the general situation of this structure. The first question is whether or not any words need to be used after "due to..." to echo it. If so, what words should be used? In principle, "due to..." is just an adverbial phrase or subordinate clause, and no conjunction is needed at the beginning of the main clause. For example:

    Due to the implementation of the principle of prioritizing recovery and fully utilizing existing transportation conditions, the new budget is less than 3% of the original budget (People's Daily, 1950.4.20). Due to the position of the leaders of the regime, the increase in the prestige of the leaders easily leads to arrogance, refusing criticism and suppressing criticism within and outside the party (People's Daily, 1950.4.22). However, sometimes in order to clearly distinguish the subordinate clause from the main clause, conjunctions such as "so" or "therefore" are added. For example:

    Due to the lack of modernized mechanical industry (should be: insufficient production of machine-made industries) and inconvenient transportation in modern China, it is still unable to meet the needs of the daily necessities of the vast number of workers and peasants, so a large part of them still have to rely on handicrafts to supply them (People's Daily, 1950.4.22; in terms of this sentence, "due to" can be omitted, and "and" can be changed to ","). Sometimes the subjectless "使(shǐ, make)" is used to introduce the main clause, such as:

    Because the Western European imperialists had no time to look eastward, they enabled Chinese national capitalism to have some new development (Hu Hua: History of the New Democratic Revolution; "因(yīn, because)" and "由于(yóuyú, due to)" are synonymous).

    Some people may feel that "因(yīn)" and "使(shǐ)" cannot coexist, or that "就使(jiù shǐ, then make)" is unnecessary, or that the word "因(yīn)" should be removed. We don't think it is necessary to be so rigid. It is permissible to use a subjectless "使(shǐ)" in a situation where there is no possibility of misunderstanding. The important points are: first, "due to..." cannot be regarded as a complete and self-sufficient sentence; second, "due to..." cannot be regarded as a nominal subordinate clause; third, if the word "使(shǐ)" is used, it is necessary to avoid ambiguous situations where it can be used as a subject and as a subjectless verb.

    Now let's look at the "due to..." in the four paragraphs of text quoted above. (c) uses "...的主要原因是由于...长期封锁与不断轰炸(...de zhǔyào yuányīn shì yóuyú...chángqí fēngsuǒ yǔ bùduàn hōngzhà, ...the main reason is due to...long-term blockade and continuous bombing)", which is to treat "due to..." as a nominal sentence equal to "reason". According to the structure of the original sentence, all those "due to" can be omitted: "...的主要原因是...长期封锁与不断轰炸(...de zhǔyào yuányīn shì...chángqí fēngsuǒ yǔ bùduàn hōngzhà, ...the main reason is...long-term blockade and continuous bombing)", which is not only smooth, but also more concise.

    The situation of the three "due to..." in (d) is different. The first "due to..." is obviously regarded as a self-sufficient sentence. In the second "due to...", it is not known whether the power of "due to" extends to "进行(jìnxíng, carry out)" or continues to "很低(hěn dī, very low)". If it is the former, then "因之...(yīn zhī, therefore...)" is regarded as the main clause; if it is the latter, then this "due to..." is again regarded as a self-sufficient sentence. The word "而(ér, and)" in the third "due to..." is used very vaguely (maybe a mistake for "因而(yīn'ér, therefore)"), and there may also be these two explanations. Regarding "due to..." as a self-sufficient sentence is inconsistent with the speaking habits of most people. If I say "Due to bad weather", people will only admit that this is only half a sentence, and still expect me to continue, for example, "Not many people attended the meeting." A first half of a sentence cannot become a complete sentence, and three first halves of sentences still cannot become a complete sentence. Although this paragraph in (d) is long, it is basically an incomplete sentence, just because it is too long (more than 200 words), we can easily overlook this point.

    If this paragraph is to be transformed, there are two ways. Either make the three parts (separated by two ";") complete and independent, then the first part must be changed to have both a subordinate clause and a main clause, and the remaining two parts can remain unchanged. Or treat all three parts as subordinate clauses, then the following sentence must be rewritten and incorporated as the main clause: After "现象(xiànxiàng, phenomenon)", do not use a period, and connect "——由于这一切，目前我们国家在经济方面就有点困难，我们一部分工人职员就有了失业的痛苦。(——yóuyú zhè yīqiè, mùqián wǒmen guójiā zài jīngjì fāngmiàn jiù yǒudiǎn kùnnán, wǒmen yībùfen gōngrén zhíyuán jiù yǒule shīyè de tòngkǔ. -- Due to all this, our country is currently experiencing some economic difficulties, and some of our workers and staff have the pain of unemployment.)"

    The sentence structure of (b) is unclear, the key lies in that "使(shǐ)" character. If we regard this "使(shǐ)" character as a subjectless verb, introducing a main clause that is relative to the above three subordinate clauses (that is, the third "due to" only extends to "变化(biànhuà, change)"), then the entire sentence is complete. However, this is difficult to pass in meaning, because the industrial and commercial enterprises affected by the blockade, bombing, and reduced purchasing power of farmers are not limited to speculative industrial and commercial enterprises. From the perspective of meaning, this "使(shǐ)" character seems to take "国民经济的改组与变化(guómín jīngjì de gǎizǔ yǔ biànhuà, the reorganization and changes of the national economy)" as its subject. With this analysis, the entire paragraph is again "due to...due to...; due to...", only three first halves of sentences and no second half sentence, an incomplete sentence.

    (a) has only one "due to", but it is also not used correctly. The "due to" here is conceptually repeated with the "所造成(suǒ zàochéng, caused by)" below. One of the two must be removed: either "失业情况的严重性主要地是由于美帝蒋匪的长期封锁和不断轰炸(shīyè qíngkuàng de yánzhòngxìng zhǔyào de shì yóuyú měidì jiǎngfěi de chángqí fēngsuǒ hé bùduàn hōngzhà, the severity of the unemployment situation is mainly due to the long-term blockade and continuous bombing by the US imperialists and Chiang bandits)", or "...是美帝蒋匪的长期封锁和不断轰炸造成的(...shì měidì jiǎngfěi de chángqí fēngsuǒ hé bùduàn hōngzhà zàochéng de, ...is caused by the long-term blockade and continuous bombing by the US imperialists and Chiang bandits)". (Note: a few "的(de)" characters are added incidentally, and a "所(suǒ)" character is removed.) The original text adds a "due to" here, perhaps treating it as the word "由(yóu, by)" -- "由你全权办理(yóu nǐ quánquán bànlǐ, handled entirely by you)" "完全由他支配(wánquán yóu tā zhīpèi, completely controlled by him)" the "由(yóu)" character. This "由(yóu)" character means "let" or "be", while "由于(yóuyú)" means "because", these two cannot be confused.

    Secondly, when using the structure of "due to...", "due to" can be followed by a word (together with its modifiers), or it can be followed by a sentence. In situations where several "due to" are used consecutively, it is best to use all words or all sentences, mixing them is not very good. The difference here often lies only in using more or less one "的(de)" character. (c)'s first "due to" is followed by a word, and the rest of the "due to" are followed by sentences. (b)'s first "due to" is followed by a word, the second "due to" is followed by a sentence, and the third "due to" is somewhat ambiguous, depending on whether "改组与变化(gǎizǔ yǔ biànhuà, reorganization and change)" is regarded as the subject of "使(shǐ)". If it is not regarded as the subject of "使(shǐ)", then "due to" is followed by a word again. Apart from the first "due to", the rest in (d) are followed by sentences. After the first "due to", up to "仇视(chóushì, hostility)" is a word, but then a verb "企图(qǐtú, attempt)" is connected, and the subject of "企图(qǐtú)" cannot be "仇视(chóushì)", it can only be "蒋匪残余(Jiǎngfěi cán yú, Chiang bandit remnants)", so the structure of this sentence is fundamentally problematic.

    It can be seen from this that the internal structure of several consecutive "due to..." in these three paragraphs of text is not consistent. If consistency is to be sought, the first clause in (b) and (c) should change the "的(de)" character in "...的封锁与轰炸(...de fēngsuǒ yǔ hōngzhà, ...blockade and bombing)" to a verb, such as "实施(shíshī, implement)" or "施行(shīxíng, carry out)" and so on. If the first clause in (d), if using native Chinese grammar, should naturally be "由于蒋匪残余极端仇视中国人民的胜利，企图...(yóuyú jiǎngfěi cán yú jíduān chóushì zhōngguó rénmín de shènglì, qǐtú..., Due to the extreme hatred of the Chiang bandit remnants for the victory of the Chinese people, attempting...)" ; If you want to dress it up a bit, you can only say "由于……蒋匪残余对于中国人民的胜利怀有极端的仇视，企图……(yóuyú…… jiǎngfěi cán yú duìyú zhōngguó rénmín de shènglì huái yǒu jíduān de chóushì, qǐtú……, Due to...the Chiang bandit remnants harbor extreme hostility towards the victory of the Chinese people, attempting...)". In short, you can't not use a verb, and just plug in a "的(de)" character.

    The narratives regarding the purchasing power of farmers in these three paragraphs are also worth comparing. (c) was written the earliest, contains the least meaning, and the sentence structure is also the most problematic. "部分农村遭受灾荒(bùfen nóngcūn zāoshòu zāihuāng, Some rural areas suffered disasters)", up to this point, the meaning is very clear, and the sentence pattern is also simple. "季节的限制(jìjié de xiànzhì, Seasonal restrictions)" probably refers to the time when spring is often a time of scarcity of food, the wording is inevitably not clear enough, and a bigger problem is to connect it with "灾荒(zāihuāng, disaster)" with an "和(hé, and)" character - does seasonal restriction only encounter partial rural areas? Then, using an "而(ér, and)" character to connect to a verb "降低(jiàngdī, reduce)", this verb is clearly parallel to "遭受(zāoshòu, suffer)", then it is "农村(nóngcūn, rural area)" reducing the purchasing power of farmers, which is also a bit unreasonable. The problem here lies in the "而(ér)" character, but also because "降低(jiàngdī)" is a common verb, not used to being used as a subjectless verb. The "使(shǐ)" character can be used as a subjectless verb, so the sentence pattern in (a) is better. However, not using any punctuation marks before the "使(shǐ)" character to separate it from the previous text will still cause readers to misunderstand that the "使(shǐ)" character only accepts "部分农村...(bùfen nóngcūn..., some rural areas...)" and discards "广大农村...(guǎngdà nóngcūn..., the vast rural areas...)", which is certainly not the author's intention. And the three characters "的影响(de yǐngxiǎng, the impact)" are also unnecessary. So this clause can be transformed into "...遭受灾荒，使……(...zāoshòu zāihuāng, shǐ..., ...suffered disasters, making...)". (d) This document was released last, the meaning contained under this item is also the most, adding the unimplemented land reform in addition to war and disaster, divided into three clauses, and then summed up as "因之广大农民的购买力很低(yīn zhī guǎngdà nóngmín de gòumǎilì hěn dī, therefore the purchasing power of the vast number of farmers is very low)", the sentence structure is relatively clear, and the meaning is also clearer.

    The examples cited in this article can represent commonly seen texts, neither too attentive nor too hasty. It is these kinds of examples that tell us that general writers, especially argumentative essay writers, have not yet fully grasped the use of long sentences, and cannot command them as desired, with clear veins, and achieve precision and fluency.

 　 读报札记
    吕叔湘
    上海总工会为了呼吁救济上海失业工人，有一封信写给全国总工会，刊载在四月十七日的人民日报上（以下用ａ代表）。同天的人民日报就以“救济上海失业工人”为题发表了一篇短评（以下用ｂ代表）。其后四月二十二日的人民日报上发表了全国总工会号召全国工人救济上海失业工人的一个通告（以下用ｃ代表），大体上是根据前两个文件改写的。这以后，四月二十四日的人民日报上又发表了一篇全国总工会关于纪念“五一”的通知（以下用ｄ代表），其中说到目前经济方面的困难，也有一段跟前几个文件的有关段落的措词大致相似。把这四个文件比较一下，在语法和修辞的研究上也可以稍有领会。现在只能拿两段来做例。
    底下这一段只是（ａ）和（ｃ）所共有：
     （ａ）自从二月六日匪机滥炸上海破坏电力以后，上海失业情况更见严重。迄目前为止，根据初步统计，失业工人人数已逾十五万人，连其家属在内不下五十万人。失业工人的生活已是十分困苦。以喝粥汤度日者已是极普遍的现象，而以豆渣、豆饼、糠秕、野菜充饥者已日有增加。因无力负担房租而遭房东驱逐退租者到处可闻。
    （ｃ）最近上海总工会为救济上海失业工人发出了迫切的呼吁，告诉我们，上海的工人兄弟姊妹处在如何困难的严重关头，他们已有十五万人陷于失业，连他们的家属计算，将近五十万人，生活十分困苦，有的喝汤粥渡日，有的以豆渣、豆饼、糠秕、野菜充饥。
    首先，我们发现，句子的长短大不相同。（ａ）有五句，（ｃ）除了把第五句省略外，把其余四句连成一句。第一句因出发点不同，措词自然也不相同，但“发端”的作用是相同的。（ａ）的五句，每一句一个单一的意思，非常清楚。（ｃ）的长句就未免包含的太多，这是现在一般人写文章的通病。“严重关头”底下可以断句，“失业”底下也可以断句，“困苦”底下可以改用“：”号。（ａ）在这里断句，是因为下面用两个句子分述食和住的困苦。）
    其次，（ｃ）用两个“有的”平列叙述，不能显出“豆渣……”和“粥汤”的困苦程度不同。把“粥汤”改做“汤粥”，也略有区别。把“度日”写成“渡日”是笔误。“陷于失业”的“陷于”可省。用“困难的”形容“严重关头”，有点费解，似不如“处在如何严重的困难之中”。这些都是（ｃ）不及（ａ）的地方。（ａ）“以喝粥汤度日”的“以”和“喝”可省去一个；跟下半句比较，省“喝”留“以”较好。
    另一段是四个文件都有的：
    （ａ）虽然如此，失业工人对于目前国家的困难及其所以造成的原因深有体会，知道失业情况的严重性主要是由于美帝蒋匪长期封锁和不断轰炸所造成。
    （ｂ）今天，由于帝国主义和国民党反动派残余匪帮对上海的封锁与轰炸，由于部分农村遭遇灾荒和季节的限制而降低了农民的购买力，以及由于物价稳定而引起的国民经济的改组与变化，使十二年来借通货膨胀而进行投机的一部分无益于国民生计的工商业宣告歇业，以致一部分工人暂时陷于失业与半失业状态。
    （ｃ）我们知道，造成这种困难情况的主要原因：是由于美帝国主义与国民党残余匪帮的长期封锁与不断轰炸；由于广大农村因受长期战争的破坏以及部分农村去年遭受灾荒的影响使农民购买力大为降低；由于过去那些专供官僚资产阶级享受的工商行业趋于必然的没落；特别是由于十二年来一直不断上涨波动的物价，今天转为稳定，使一部分靠做投机买卖的工商业不能维持而宣告歇业倒闭等等。
    （ｄ）但是，由于美帝国主义所拚命支持的蒋匪残余，对于中国人民胜利的极端仇视，企图用封锁、轰炸等疯狂手段破坏我们的胜利果实，来达到他们临死挣扎，苟延残喘的目的；由于广大农村遭受长期战争破坏，加上去年有不少地区遭受着重大的水灾，土地改革又还没有进行，因之广大农民的购买力很低；由于原来专供帝国主义、官僚资产阶级和封建地主腐化享乐的一部分工商业趋于必不可免的衰落，加上最近物价稳定，对于向来依靠通货膨胀营利的一部分投机工商业者造成不利的情况，而发生一些工厂商店停工停业的现象。所有这一切就造成了目前我们国家在经济方面的困难，增加了我们一部分工人职员失业的痛苦。这一段说明目前这个困难情况的原因。这里面（ａ）是原始的文件，特别简单，只指出这个情况主要地是由于封锁和轰炸。（ｂ）似乎嫌（ａ）的说法太简单，所以用三个“由于”列举三种原因：封锁和轰炸，农村购买力低落，物价稳定因而投机性工商业倒闭。（ｃ）和（ｂ）的写成又在（ｄ）之后，又都增加了一个项目：某一类消费工商业的趋于必然的没落。但（ｃ）是另列一项，因此一共用了四个“由于”；（ｄ）则把这新添的一项合并在第三项之内，用“加上”，不用另一个“由于”。这是内容的大概比较。现在我们要来比较他们的表现法。
    这四段文字都应用“由于……”的构造，所以我们不妨先研究一下这种构造的一般情形。首先是“由于”之后需要不需要用什么词语来跟它呼应的问题，如果需要，又应该用什么词语？按说，“由于……”只是一个副词语或附属句，主要句的前头是可以不用什么连接词的。如：
    由于贯彻了重点恢复及充分利用现有交通条件的精神，新概算尚不及原概算的百分之三（人民日报，五○·四·二○），由于政权领导者的地位，领导者威信的提高就容易产生骄傲情绪，在党内党外拒绝批评，压制批评（人民日报，五○·四·二二）。可是有时候为了划清附属句和主要句的界限，也有加用“所以”“因此”之类的连接词的。如：
    由于中国近代化机械工业不足（应该是：机制工业生产不足）和交通不便，还不能适应广大工人农民的日常生活用品的需要，因此其中很大部分仍要依靠手工业来供应（人民日报，五○·四·二二；以这句而论，“由于”可省，“和”改“，”号）。有时候又用无主语的“使”字来引进主要句，如：
    因西欧各帝国主义无暇东顾，就使中国民族资本主义有了若干新的发展（胡华：新民主主义革命史；“因”和“由于”同义）。
    也许有人觉得“因”和“使”不能并存，或是不要“就使”，或是去掉“因”字。我们倒觉得不必如此拘泥，在没有误会可能的场合用个无主语的“使”字也未尝不可。重要之点是：一，不能把“由于……”当作一个完全的、自足自给的句子；二，不能把“由于……”当作一个名词性的附属句；三，如果用“使”字，务必要避免可作有主语又可作无主语的两可情形。
    现在让我们来看看前引四段文字里面的“由于……”。（ｃ）用“……的主要原因是由于……长期封锁与不断轰炸”，那就是把“由于……”当作名词性的句子来和“原因”相等了。照原句的结构，那些“由于”全部可以省去：“……的主要原因是……长期封锁与不断轰炸”，不但通顺，也更简洁。
    （ｄ）的三个“由于……”的情况不一样。第一个“由于……”很明显地是当作一个自足自给的句子的。第二个“由于……”里面，不知道“由于”的力量是管到“进行”为止呢，还是一直贯注到“很低”？如果是前者，那是把“因之……”当作主要句；如果是后者，那末这个“由于……”又是当作一个自足自给的句子的。第三个“由于……”里面的“而”字用的很含混（也许是“因而”之误），也可能有这两种解释。把“由于……”当作一个自足自给的句子是不合于一般人的说话习惯的。假如我说“由于天气恶劣”，人家一定只承认这只是半句话，还期待我说下去，比如说，“到会的人不多。”一个上半句不能成为全句，三个上半句还是不能成为全句。（ｄ）这一段虽长，基本上是一个残缺的句子，只是因为它太长（二百多字），我们很容易把这一点忽略过去罢了。
    这一段若是要改造，有两个办法。或是使三个部分（两个“；”隔开的）都能完整独立，那就要把第一个部分改成有附属句也有主要句，其余两个部分可以不动。或是把这三个部分都当作附属句，那就得把底下一句改写后并进来作主要句：“现象”之后不用句号，接上“——由于这一切，目前我们国家在经济方面就有点困难，我们一部分工人职员就有了失业的痛苦。”
    （ｂ）的句子构造欠明确，关键在于那个“使”字。若是把这个“使”字当作一个无主动词，引进一个跟上面三个附属句相对的主要句（就是说，第三个“由于”只管到“变化”为止），那末整个的句子是完整的。可是这在意义上难于通过，因为封锁、轰炸、农民购买力降低这些因素所影响到的工商业不限于投机性的工商业。从意义上看，这个“使”字似乎是拿“国民经济的改组与变化”做它的主语的。这么一分析，整个这一段又是“由于……由于……；由于……”，只有三个上半句而没有一个下半句的残缺句子。
    （ａ）只有一个“由于”，可是也没用对。这里的“由于”跟下面的“所造成”在意念上是重复的，二者必去其一：或是“失业情况的严重性主要地是由于美帝蒋匪的长期封锁和不断轰炸”，或是“……是美帝蒋匪的长期封锁和不断轰炸造成的。”（注意：附带加了几个“的”字，去掉一个“所”字。）原文在这里加上一个“由于”，也许是把它当“由”字用了——“由你全权办理”“完全由他支配”的“由”。这个“由”字是“让”或“被”的意思，而“由于”是“因为”的意思，这是不能混为一谈的。
    其次，用“由于……”的构造的时候，“由于”之后可以是一个词（连同它的附加语），也可以是一个句。在连用几个“由于”的场合，最好是全用词，或是全用句，夹杂起来用是不大好的。这里面的出入往往只在于多用或少用一个“的”字。（ｃ）的第一个“由于”之后是一个词，其余的“由于”之后都是句。（ｂ）的第一个“由于”之后是一个词，第二个“由于”之后是一个句，第三个“由于”之后有些两可，要看“改组与变化”是否作为“使”的主语看待。假如不作为“使”的主语，那末“由于”之后又是一个词。（ｄ）除第一个“由于”外，其后都是句。第一个“由于”之后，到“仇视”为止是一个词，但是底下接一个动词“企图”，而“企图”的主语又不可能是“仇视”，只能是“蒋匪残余”，所以这一句的构造根本有问题。
    由此可见，这三段文字里没有一段的一连几个“由于……”的内部构造是一律的。要是求其一律，（ｂ）和（ｃ）的第一小句都应该把“……的封锁与轰炸”的“的”字改成一个动词，如“实施”或“施行”之类。（ｄ）的第一个小句，如果用中国土生土长的语法，自然该是“由于蒋匪残余极端仇视中国人民的胜利，企图……”；如果要打扮得摩登一点，也只能说“由于……蒋匪残余对于中国人民的胜利怀有极端的仇视，企图……”。总之，不能不用动词，塞上一个“的”字了事。
    这三段里面关于农民购买力这一项的叙说也值得比较一下。（ｃ）的写作最早，包含的意思最少，句子的构造也最有问题。“部分农村遭受灾荒”，到此为止，意思很清楚，句法也单纯。“季节的限制”大概指春天常是青黄不接之时，措词已经不免欠显豁，而更大的毛病是用一个“和”字把它跟“灾荒”连上——难道季节的限制也只有部分的农村遭遇着吗？底下又用“而”字接上一个动词“降低”，这个动词分明是跟“遭受”并行的，那末是“农村”降低了农民的购买力了，这也有点说不过去。这里的毛病固然出在“而”字上，同时也因为“降低”是一个普通动词，不习惯作无主动词用。“使”字可以作无主动词用，所以（ａ）的句法较好。但是“使”字前头不用任何标点符号和上文隔开，仍然会叫读者误会“使”字只承接“部分农村……”这一层，把“广大农村……”这一层丢开，这当然不是作者的意思。而且“的影响”三个字也没有需要。所以这一小句可以改造成“……遭受灾荒，使……”。（ｄ）这个文件最后出，这一项底下所包含的意思也最多，除战争和灾荒外又加上土改的尚未实行，分作三个小句，然后总结为“因之广大农民的购买力很低，”句子的构造比较明确，意思也更清楚。
    本文引的例子可以代表一般常见的文字，不是太经心的，也不是太草率的。就是这类例子告诉我们，一般的写作者，尤其是议论文的写作者，对于长句的运用还没有十分把握，还不能指挥如意，脉胳分明，做到精密而又流畅的地步。（转载自《学习》杂志第二卷第五期）
