　　Reactionary Slogans Should Be Erased Quickly
    A few days ago, we took the train on the Beijing-Ningbo Railway eastward. When passing a village north of the railway between Huangcun and Weishancun, we saw the four characters "Suppress the Rebellion and Build the Nation" on the wall of a villager's house, left over from the enemy-occupied period, which were clearly visible from the train. We hope that local staff in various places will thoroughly wash away these reactionary slogans! Chen Lan

　　反动标语赶快擦去
    前几天我们从北京坐北宁路的火车向东去，经过黄村与魏善村庄之间的铁道北边的一个村子，看见老乡的墙上还有敌占时代遗留的反动标语“戡乱建国”四个大字，坐在火车上，看得非常清楚。希望各地地方工作人员将这些反动的标语洗擦干尽！陈岚
