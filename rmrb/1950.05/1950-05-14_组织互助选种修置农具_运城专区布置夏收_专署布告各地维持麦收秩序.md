　　Yuncheng Prefecture Deploys Summer Harvest
　　Commissioner's Office Issues Proclamation to Maintain Order During Wheat Harvest in Various Areas

[Our newspaper Yuncheng report] Cotton planting in the Yuncheng Prefecture of Shanxi Province is nearing completion, and the wheat harvest season is approaching. The Commissioner's Office issued instructions to all subordinate counties on April 27th, combining the current sowing of autumn miscellaneous crops to begin summer harvest preparations as soon as possible. The instructions pointed out: "To have a good wheat harvest, preparation must be early." Therefore, (1) Purchase and repair farm tools: all localities should combine bank agricultural loans, organize iron, woodworkers, and other handicraft workers to manufacture or repair various farm tools needed for the wheat harvest for the masses; and can organize farm tool fairs to plan the adjustment of supply and demand; if one household cannot purchase them, but they are necessary, the masses should be mobilized to purchase and use them jointly, so that everyone has tools and does not delay the summer harvest. (2) Select wheat seeds: This year's seed selection is the most important thing in agricultural production and must achieve significant results. From now on, we should use various occasions and methods to deeply promote the benefits of field seed selection, select high-quality wheat varieties that are recognized by the masses as cold-resistant, drought-resistant, and high-yielding, determine seed collection areas in advance, conduct regular field inspections, and immediately pull out and burn diseased plants. When selecting seeds, be careful to avoid field edges, water edges, and manure piles, and select ears in the middle of the field where the seedlings are neither sparse nor dense. Selected seeds must be threshed, harvested, dried, and stored separately to maintain the purity of the seeds. (3) Fight against disasters. In addition to continuing to complete weeding, hoeing, irrigation, pest control, and early attention to the occurrence and spread of wheat yellow and black rust, farmers must be educated to identify yellow and black rust seedlings, conduct regular field inspections, and explain the pros and cons to the masses using an accounting method, and immediately pull out diseased plants when found. The experience of old farmers in Ruicheng pressing the wheat into a gentle slope against the wind with sticks five or six days before the wheat harvest to avoid wind damage should be spread throughout the region. In addition, mountainous areas should mobilize the masses to block sparrow nests and kill field rats to prevent damage to crops. (4) Conduct wheat protection education, implement wheat protection covenants, and organize militia to patrol the fields to prevent bad elements from stealing and destroying. (5) "Summer harvest is like snatching food from a tiger's mouth," which requires extensive organization and scientific division of labor under the principles of "voluntary" and "equivalent value" to organize labor mutual assistance. At the same time, we must do a good job in the substitute harvesting for families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, so that they do not suffer any losses. The instructions finally emphasized that leaders at all levels should do a good job in mobilization, and local cadres should strictly adhere to their posts. Local organs and troops should give full play to their fine traditions to help the summer harvest, and the livestock and carts of organs and troops should be uniformly allocated and adjusted by temporary "help-harvesting stations" formed by governments at all levels. After receiving the instructions, various counties are actively deploying.

[Another News] The Yuncheng Prefecture of Shanxi Province is expecting a bumper wheat harvest. In order to protect wheat fields and maintain good order during the wheat harvest period, the Commissioner's Office issued a proclamation on May 4th: It is strictly forbidden to walk in wheat fields, and livestock, pigs, sheep, chickens, etc. are not allowed to enter wheat fields and damage them. Violators shall compensate the wheat owner for the loss; those who intentionally disrupt, spread rumors, incite theft, destroy wheat fields, or disrupt the wheat harvest order shall be immediately arrested and sent to the county or district government for strict investigation and prosecution. Finally, the proclamation called on the people of the entire region to immediately launch a broad and powerful wheat protection movement, organize militias, patrol the fields in shifts, and, when necessary, villages and districts can organize joint wheat protection. For idlers who do not engage in production, they should be educated and organized to participate in production, and refugees from outside the area should be well organized to participate in the wheat harvest and given appropriate wages.
