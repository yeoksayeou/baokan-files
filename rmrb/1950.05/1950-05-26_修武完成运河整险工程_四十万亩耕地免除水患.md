　　Xinxiang News: With the leadership of the Xiuwu County People's Government and the Xiuwu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the civilian laborers of Xiuwu County, Pingyuan Province, have completed the renovation project of the Yunhe Canal, sparing over 400,000 mu of farmland from floods. This canal stretches 60 li, from Xinan Town in the west to Guansi Bridge in the east, traversing the entirety of Xiuwu County. In the past, navigation was very convenient, but since the completion of the Daokou-Qinyang Railway, its function gradually diminished. Coupled with the impact of war, it had been neglected for many years, leading to siltation of the riverbed and recurring floods. During the flood season last year, residents along the river, under the leadership of the local People's Government and the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, worked tirelessly day and night to reinforce the banks, barely preventing a breach. Last winter, under the principle of not hindering land reform, and due to the cold weather, only the river channel was widened. In some places, the ground level was lower than the water level. After widening the river channel, the soil was pushed back, resulting in even lower embankment bodies. Without repairs, there was a risk of over 400,000 mu of land being flooded once the flood season arrived. To address this, the Xinxiang Special Commissioner's Office, after surveying and planning, submitted a request to the Provincial Government for approval to design dikes based on the 1949 flood level, in order to repair dangerous sections that were lower than or slightly higher than the flood level. This project required restoring 27,380 meters of dikes and excavating 271,278 cubic meters of earth. The Xiuwu County People's Government, in accordance with the aforementioned plan, convened a meeting of relevant district and village cadres and river management committee members in late April to arrange the renovation tasks and explain the techniques. Under the principle of not delaying agricultural work, and combining disaster relief with work-for-relief, the districts and villages loaned out 133,120 jin of millet, mobilizing 12,582 men and women (full and half laborers) from 38 administrative villages in the first, second, and third districts to participate in the renovation. The villages began work successively on May 1st and 2nd. Because the masses had suffered from floods for many years, and the government provided large amounts of grain for assistance, most people worked diligently and initiated competitions, which increased work efficiency. The entire renovation project was successfully completed on the 9th of this month, saving over 400,000 mu of farmland from floods.

　　修武完成运河整险工程  四十万亩耕地免除水患
    【本报新乡讯】平原省修武县民工，在县人民政府、中共县委领导下，完成运河整险工程；四十余万亩耕地，免除水患。该河西起新安镇，东迄官司桥，长达六十华里，横贯修武全境。往年航运甚便，自道清铁路通车后，作用渐失，加以战争影响，多年失修，以致河床淤塞，历年泛滥成灾。去年汛期，沿河居民，在当地人民政府和中共县委的领导下，不分昼夜大力抢险，始免溃决。去冬在不妨碍土地改革的原则下，因天寒地冻，只将河身开宽。有些地方，地平面低于水平面，将河身开宽后，土往后倒，以致堤身更低。如不修复，汛期一到，便有四十余万亩土地被淹的危险。为此，新乡专署于测量计划后，呈请省府批准，依据一九四九年洪水位，设计堤防，以修整低于洪水位或稍高于洪水位的险工。此项工程共需复堤长二万七千三百八十公尺，起土二十七万一千二百七十八公方。修武县人民政府依照上述计划，于四月下旬，召开了有关各区村干部及治河委员会议，布置了整险任务，并讲解了技术。各区、村在不误农时原则下，结合救灾，以工代赈，贷出小米十三万三千一百二十斤，发动一、二、三区三十八个行政村男女全半劳力一万二千五百八十二人，参加整险。各村先后在五月一、二日开始动工。由于群众历年饱受水灾痛苦，政府又贷给大批粮食扶助，所以大部都能认真作工，并掀起竞赛，提高了工作效率。全部整险工程在本月九日即顺利完成，使四十余万亩耕地免除水患。
