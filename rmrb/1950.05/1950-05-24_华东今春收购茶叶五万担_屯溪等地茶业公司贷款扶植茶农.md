Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 22nd: Since the spring tea season began this year, the China Tea Company's East China District Company has been making purchases in various tea-producing regions. As of mid-May, according to incomplete statistics, it has purchased 38,420 dan of crude red tea, 6,790 dan of crude green tea, 5,000 dan of flat tea, and 168 dan of oolong tea.

The purchase of Keemun black tea is nearing completion, and various localities are continuing to purchase red and green tea.

To support tea farmers' production, the Tunxi, Hangzhou, and Fuzhou branch companies of the China Tea Company's East China District Company provided loans of over 9,238,000 jin of rice (6 dou of rice per dan of crude tea, 8 dou for trial-produced black tea, converted into RMB for lending, along with a portion of rice) directly to impoverished tea farmers in January and February of this year. The Anhui South and Zhejiang branch companies also focused on guiding tea farmers in some green tea areas to trial-produce black tea. After obtaining loans, tea farmers generally took better care of their tea plants, and the picked leaves were fresher and more tender than in previous years. During the purchasing process, state-owned trading companies in various localities established many purchasing stations in tea-producing areas to directly purchase tea from tea farmers at reasonable prices and transported large quantities of grain, oil, salt, cloth, and other necessities to supply tea farmers at low prices, reducing intermediate exploitation.

At the same time, East China is also paying attention to establishing a tea processing industry. In addition to the two existing mechanized tea factories in Hangzhou, plans are underway to establish one factory each in Qimen, Tunxi, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Fu'an, and six other towns. The Fuzhou factory has already started production, and machinery has been transported to other locations, with factory buildings still under construction.

The East China tea-producing region is distributed in Qimen and Tunxi in southern Anhui, Lu'an in northern Anhui, Ping Shui, Sui'an, Chun'an, Wenzhou, Hangzhou, and Huzhou in Zhejiang, and Fuding, Jian'ou, and Anxi counties in Fujian. Including Taiwan, which is yet to be liberated, the total tea production in East China accounts for more than 60 percent of the country's total tea production, of which export tea accounts for about 80 percent of the country's total exports. In terms of export tea, Keemun and Minhong black teas are the most famous, mostly sold to the United Kingdom in the past, but mainly sold to the Soviet Union in recent years; Ping Shui pearl tea and Tunlv green tea are the most famous, mostly sold to the United States and the Soviet Union in the past, but mainly sold to the Soviet Union and Africa in recent years; other teas, such as Fujian oolong tea, are sold to Southeast Asia.

Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the annual output of export red and green tea in southern Anhui, Fujian, and Zhejiang reached 700,000 to 800,000 dan. During the war, production decreased due to blocked sales channels, but it remained between 400,000 and 500,000 dan. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, under the exploitation and control of the Kuomintang reactionary bandit gangs, bureaucratic capitalists, local tyrants, and tea merchants colluding with them, tea farmers found it unprofitable and cut down tea trees one after another to plant other crops; the annual export of red and green tea sharply decreased to about 150,000 to 200,000 dan.

### 华东今春收购茶叶五万担  屯溪等地茶业公司贷款扶植茶农

　　华东今春收购茶叶五万担
    屯溪等地茶业公司贷款扶植茶农
    【新华社上海二十二日电】今年春茶上市以来，中国茶业公司华东区公司即在各产区进行收购。至五月中旬为止，据不完全统计，已收进毛红三万八千四百二十担，毛绿六千七百九十担，片茶五千担，青茶一百六十八担。
    现祁红春茶的收购已近尾声，各地正在继续收购红绿茶。
    中国茶业公司华东区公司所属屯溪、杭州、福州三个分公司为扶助茶农生产，于今年一、二月间贷放了九百二十三万八千余斤大米的贷款（每担毛茶贷米六斗，试制红茶八斗，折成人民币贷放，并配合一部分大米），直接贷给贫苦茶农。皖南、浙江两分公司并有重点地在部分绿茶区指导茶农试制红茶。茶棵获得贷款后，一般都对茶棵加意培植，采摘亦较往年鲜嫩。在收购过程中，各地国营贸易公司在各产区设立很多收购站，以合理价格向茶农直接收购，并运来大量粮食、油、盐、布匹等生活必需品，低价供给茶农，减少了中间剥削。
    与此同时，华东区并注意建立茶叶加工业。除杭州原有机器造茶厂二所以外，计划再在祁门、屯溪、杭州、温州、福州、福安等十二个城镇各设一厂，其中福州厂业已开工生产，其余各地机器均已运到，厂房尚在建造中。
    华东茶产区分布于皖南的祁门、屯溪、皖北的六安，浙江的平水、遂安、淳安、温州、杭州、湖州，福建的福鼎、建瓯、安溪等县境内。若包括待解放区台湾在内，全华东产茶量约占全国产茶总额的百分之六十以上，其中外销茶约占全国外销总额的百分之八十左右。外销茶方面，红茶以祁门、闽红最著名，过去多销英国，近年主要销往苏联；绿茶以平水珠茶、屯绿最著名，过去多销美国、苏联，近年主要销往苏联、非洲；其他如福建青茶则行销于南洋一带。
    抗日战争以前，皖南、福建、浙江每年所产外销红绿花达七十至八十万担。抗战期间，因销路阻滞减产，但尚在四十至五十万担之间。日寇投降后，在国民党反动匪帮官僚资本、地主豪劣及与他们勾结的茶商等的剥削控制下，茶农无利可图，纷纷砍倒茶树，改种其他作物；每年外销红绿茶遂锐减至十五万到二十万担左右。
