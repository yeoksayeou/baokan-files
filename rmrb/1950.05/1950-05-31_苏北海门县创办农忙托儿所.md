Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 30th: The People's Government of Haimen County, Northern Jiangsu, and the County Democratic Women's Federation, in order to enable women with children to devote themselves wholeheartedly to production, have established nurseries with a focus on key areas before the wheat harvest. Currently, sixteen nurseries have been established in the county's eight districts. After women's work cadres repeatedly explained the role of the nurseries, many rural women in the county sent their children to the nurseries. In the eight nurseries in Hainan, Xinnan, Jiezhi, and Huitong districts alone, 111 children have been admitted. The working staff of each nursery is composed of women's federation cadres from various districts or townships, female teachers from primary schools, and some women from the masses. The children admitted to the nurseries are temporarily limited to the children of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, working cadres, and ordinary farming families who lack manpower to take care of them, aged between eight months and six years. They are sent to the nurseries for care during the day and taken home at night. The scheduled time for care is half a month to a month. Most of the children bring their own food, and the county People's Government allocates a portion of social education funds to help the children of some households with difficulties.

Due to the conscientious responsibility of the working cadres, the nurseries in various districts and townships of the county are generally well-run. The Huitong District Nursery admitted a three-year-old child of a farmer named Lu Cheng. When he first arrived, the child cried and made a fuss, and was very difficult to manage. But after staying in the nursery for a few days, he was reluctant to go home even at night. Parents said: "The People's Government takes care of the people even more attentively than parents take care of their children, and came up with such a good idea, enabling us to do a lot more work!"

　　苏北海门县创办农忙托儿所
    【新华社上海三十日电】苏北海门县人民政府、县民主妇联为使有孩子的妇女能够全心全意投入生产，特在麦收前有重点地创办农忙托儿所。现该县八个区已办了十六所。经过妇女工作干部反复说明托儿所的作用以后，该县许多农妇纷纷把自己的孩子送进托儿所。仅海南、新南、节之、汇通等四个区八个托儿所即已收容小孩一百十一名。各托儿所工作干部由各区或乡的妇联干部、小学校女教师及一部分妇女群众担任。托儿所受托儿童现暂限于革命烈士、军人、工作干部子弟及一般缺少人手照管的农家小孩，年龄在八个月至六岁，白天送托儿所照料，晚上抱回家去。受托时间预定为半个月至一个月。小孩伙食大部自带，有些困难户的小孩则由县人民政府拨出一部分社会教育经费予以帮助。
    由于工作干部的切实负责，该县各区乡托儿所一般都办得很好。汇通区托儿所收留了农民陆成的一个三岁小孩子，刚来时小孩哭哭嚷嚷，很不好带。但在托儿所住上几天，连晚上也不肯回家了。家长们说：“人民政府照顾人民比父母照顾孩子还周到，想出这样好的主意，使我们多做许多活计！”
