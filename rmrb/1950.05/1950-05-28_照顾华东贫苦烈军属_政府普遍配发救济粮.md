　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 25th. To care for the living difficulties of poor revolutionary martyrs' families, the Central People's Government has allocated 21.84 million jin of relief grain for the families of armed forces in the East China region for the first half of the year. This has been distributed to subordinate units by the East China Military Region and the Political Department of the Third Field Army.

　　After receiving the relief grain, the political organs of each unit generally carried out mobilization and education within the troops. They also carefully studied the experience of previous relief work for military families, paid attention to investigating and researching the situation of production and self-help in various regions and the urgency of the military families being aided. They adopted the method of self-reporting, mutual reporting, public discussion, and leadership review and approval to carry out fair and reasonable distribution. The distribution of relief grain has now generally begun. According to preliminary estimates, 15% to 25% of the commanders and fighters in each unit have received relief grain for their families. In the process of distribution, each unit has generally established remittance groups under the leadership of the political organs, or designated special personnel to be responsible. In areas where grain coupons are not easy to use, the equivalent amount is converted into cash and remitted.

　　All commanders and fighters expressed their infinite gratitude to the Central People's Government for allocating huge amounts of grain to relieve military families at a time when the national financial economy is extremely difficult. They wrote letters to their superiors, determined to answer the love of the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country by completing the glorious task of liberating Taiwan and wiping out the remaining enemies along the coast. Many of the commanders and fighters who have been aided have also written letters home, encouraging their families to work hard in production and self-help, reduce the burden on the people, actively respond to the call of the People's Government, and strive to build a new China.

　　照顾华东贫苦烈军属  政府普遍配发救济粮
    【新华社南京二十五日电】中央人民政府为照顾贫苦烈军属的生活困难而发给华东区武装部队上半年家属救济粮二千一百八十四万斤，已由华东军区和第三野战军政治部分配所属各部。
    各部政治机关接到救济粮后，普遍在部队中进行了动员和教育，并认真研究了过去几次救济军属工作的经验，注意调查研究了各个地区的生产自救情况与被救济军属的急迫程度，采取自报互报公议与领导审核批准的办法，进行了公平合理的分配。现救济粮已普遍开始发放，据初步估计，各部队指战员中，有百分之十五至百分之二十五获得家属救济粮。各部在发放中普遍建立了在政治机关领导下的汇寄小组，或确定专人负责。凡粮票不易使用的地区均折款汇出。
    全体指战员对中央人民政府在国家财政经济极为困难之际拨出巨额粮食救济军属一举，一致表示无限感激，纷纷写信给上级首长，决心以完成解放台湾，肃清沿海残敌的光荣任务，来回答中央人民政府与全国人民的热爱。很多被救济的指战员也都写信回家，勉励家属努力生产自救，减轻人民负担，积极响应人民政府的号召，为建设新中国而奋斗。
