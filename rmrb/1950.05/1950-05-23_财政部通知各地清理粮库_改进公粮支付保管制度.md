　　Ministry of Finance Issues Notice to Clear Grain Depots
　　Improve Public Grain Payment and Storage Systems
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 22nd] The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, considering that the autumn grain collection and grain transfer work of last year have been largely completed in various regions, and the summer grain collection this year is about to begin, has issued a notice to the major administrative regions and centrally-administered provinces (cities) on clearing grain depots and improving public grain payment and storage systems in order to prepare the necessary good conditions for summer grain storage. The notice requires all regions to seize the time and immediately conduct a general and in-depth inspection of grain revenue and expenditure and grain storage work, combine it with the repair of grain depots, clear old grain, and improve various work systems. The notice emphasizes that in order to complete the above work, all regions must pay attention to the following two points:
　　1. All regions should immediately separate the storage of national public grain and local grain in accordance with the "Decision on Unifying the Revenue, Expenditure, Storage, and Dispatch of National Public Grain" promulgated by the Government Administration Council. Therefore, the grain departments of all regions should immediately take the initiative to contact the local people's governments to solve the housing problem for separate storage of grain, and should strictly implement the decision of the Government Administration Council, giving priority to the needs of the central grain depots. In areas where separate storage is temporarily difficult, efforts should also be made to prepare conditions and strive to separate storage by the autumn grain collection this year at the latest. Those who temporarily store national public grain and local grain together should strictly separate the revenue and expenditure and grain affairs expenses of the two in separate accounts and should not confuse them. The county grain depots can set up special personnel to be responsible and should establish a certain work system. All expenses shall be paid from the local public grain.
　　2. Strive to accurately grasp the figures of grain in storage. This requires strict implementation of the public grain payment system. National public grain must be handled in accordance with the prescribed procedures for payment and allocation, and it is strictly forbidden to misappropriate or arbitrarily use it. The grain depots in all regions should also earnestly implement periodic reporting and reporting of revenue and expenditure, so that the central government can accurately grasp the national public grain figures and revenue and expenditure.

　　财政部通知各地清理粮库
    改进公粮支付保管制度
    【新华社二十二日讯】中央人民政府财政部以各地去年秋征及粮食调运工作皆已大体完成，今年夏征即将开始，为给夏征粮食入库准备必要的良好条件，特向各大行政区及中央直辖省（市）财政、粮食部门发出关于清理粮仓、健全公粮支付、保管制度的通知。通知要求各地应抓紧时间，立即进行普遍深入的粮食收支和粮食保管工作的检查，结合修整粮库，清理旧粮及健全各种工作制度。通知着重指出，为了完成上述工作，各地必须注意下列两点：
    一、各地应即根据政务院前所颁布的“关于统一国家公粮收支、保管、调度的决定”，将国家公粮与地方粮分开保管。因此各地粮食部门，应即主动与地方人民政府联系，解决粮食分开保管的房屋问题，并应严格执行政务院的决定，尽先照顾中央粮库的需要。在执行分开保管暂时有困难的地区，亦应努力准备条件，争取至迟于今年秋征前分开保管。其将国家公粮与地方粮暂时合并存放者，应将两者收支及粮务费用严格分开立账，不可混乱。县粮库可设专人负责，应建立一定的工作制度，一切费用，则由地方公粮内开支。
    二、争取确实掌握存粮数字。这就必须严格贯彻公粮支付制度。国家公粮一定要按照规定手续办理支拨，严禁挪用及随便动支等情事。各地粮库并应认真执行按期解报及收支情况报告，以便中央能够确实掌握全国公粮数字及收支情况。
