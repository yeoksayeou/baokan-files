Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th. Shandong Province has sown over 5.3 million mu of cotton fields this spring, exceeding last year's sown area by 1.3 million mu. Before planting cotton this spring, the Provincial Department of Industry and Commerce dispatched 70 cotton work team members to cotton-producing areas to assist in the purchase and inspection of cotton seeds. They purchased over 3.64 million jin of high-quality Si Zi cotton and purchased another 2 million jin from other regions, which were loaned to farmers for promotion. At the same time, provincial and administrative office-level cotton improvement organizations were established. High-quality cotton seed breeding and management areas were established in cotton-producing counties such as Ju County, Gaomi, Pingnan, Qidong, and Linyi, and a plan to promote the breeding of 400,000 mu of high-quality cotton seeds has been completed. In mid-April, there was widespread rain in the province, and local governments seized the opportunity to lead farmers to plant cotton. The Department of Industry and Commerce dispatched 56 cotton technicians to guide farmers in planting cotton fields. Now, some cotton seedlings have emerged. Agricultural farms in various counties are leading farmers in preventing and controlling cotton aphid in the cotton fields and preparing for weeding and pruning cotton.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 19th. Shaanxi Province has sown nearly 3.2 million mu of cotton fields this spring, accounting for 15.6% of the national cotton planting plan this year, an increase of one-tenth compared to the province's cotton planting area last year. Cotton seedlings have emerged in some areas. According to estimates based on average harvests and improved technical conditions, the province can produce more than 1.05 million dan of raw cotton this year.

In order to complete this year's cotton production task, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, in addition to systematically mobilizing farmers to collect manure and produce fertilizer to overcome the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer in cotton fields, the Provincial Department of Agriculture also loaned 2,000 tons of chemical fertilizer to cotton farmers, which can fertilize more than 270,000 mu of land. The Northwest Branch of the People's Bank of China also issued 150,000 jin of millet in agricultural tool and pesticide loans in mid-April and expanded cotton field loans by 9 million jin, planning to restore 220,000 mu of cotton fields in flooded areas.

However, in some cotton-growing areas, due to the failure to carefully inspect cotton seeds in advance, there is a lack of seedlings in the planted cotton fields. At present, governments at all levels are vigorously leading cotton farmers to replant. Banks in various regions have issued large amounts of loans to solve the difficulty of cotton farmers lacking seeds for replanting. Replanting has now been completed in the Guanzhong area. Chang'an County has replanted more than 2,000 mu of cotton fields with missing seedlings.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th. According to a report from the Spring Plowing Inspection Team of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government: Cotton aphids have been found to be harming cotton seedlings that have emerged in Hebei, Pingyuan, and Henan. Each true leaf of the cotton seedlings has three or four aphids, and the affected cotton leaves have begun to curl. The situation is continuing to develop. In order to quickly eliminate cotton aphid damage, the Ministry of Agriculture issued instructions on the 17th, ordering major administrative regions and provincial people's governments to organize farmers and advocate the use of simple methods such as spraying tobacco water to eliminate aphids, and to carry out prevention and control as soon as possible to curb its development. The instructions call on cadres who lead agricultural production in various regions to learn cotton aphid prevention and control techniques and lead farmers to launch a campaign to prevent and control aphids. The Ministry of Agriculture has also distributed 19,000 sprayers to various provinces in North China. Cotton aphid damage has always been extremely common in our country. Affected cotton often experiences a reduction in production of 10% to 20%. Cotton aphids can reproduce a generation in five days, and it is necessary to eliminate and control them as soon as they are discovered. In recent years, the liberated areas have advocated the use of tobacco water (one jin of tobacco soaked in 50 to 80 jin of water), tobacco lime water (one jin each of tobacco and quicklime soaked in 60 jin of water), or cotton oil soap (the oil residue left over from bleaching cottonseed oil, adding 100 times water to form, which farmers call black pancreas) to spray and kill aphids. The methods are simple and effective. When there are not enough sprayers, farmers can also be organized to use the dip-and-drench method for drug killing.

　　鲁陕种棉八百五十万亩
    农业部指示组织农民防治棉蚜
    【新华社济南十九日电】山东全省今春共播种棉田五百三十余万亩，超过去年播种面积一百三十万亩。在今春植棉前，省实业厅即派出棉业工作队七十人，分赴产棉区协助收购和检验棉籽等工作，共收购优良品种斯字棉三百六十四万余斤，并自外地购来二百万斤，贷放给农民推广。同时又先后成立省、行署两级棉业改进机构，并在莒县、高密、平南、齐东、临邑等产棉县设立优良棉种繁殖管理区，现已完成推广繁殖优良棉种四十万亩的计划。四月中旬，全省普雨，各地人民政府即抓紧时机领导农民植棉，实业厅并派出五十六名棉业技术人员，到各地指导农民播种棉田。现部分棉苗业已出土。各县农场正领导农民进行防除棉田蚜虫和准备锄棉、修棉等工作。
    【新华社西安十九日电】陕西省今春播种棉田近三百二十万亩，占全国今年植棉计划的百分之十五点六，较去年该省植棉面积增加十分之一。现有些地区棉苗业已出土。按照平年收成和技术情况改进估计，今年全省可产原棉一百零五万余担。
    陕西省人民政府为完成今年产棉任务，除有计划地发动农民拾粪造肥，克服历来棉田缺乏肥料的困难外，省府农业厅并贷给棉农化学肥料二千吨，可肥地二十七万余亩。中国人民银行西北区行又于四月中旬发放农具药械贷款小米十五万斤，扩大棉田贷款九百万斤，拟恢复水淹地棉田二十二万亩。
    但在部分种棉地区，由于事先未仔细检验棉籽，所种棉田发生缺苗现象。现各级人民政府正大力领导棉农补种。各地银行发放大批贷款，解决棉农补种时缺乏种籽的困难。关中地区现已补种完毕。长安县已补种两千余亩缺苗棉田。
    【新华社十九日讯】据中央人民政府农业部春耕检查组报告：河北、平原、河南出土棉苗已发现棉蚜为害，棉苗的每一片真叶已有三、四个蚜虫，被害棉叶开始卷缩。为害情形并在继续发展中。农业部为迅速扑灭棉花蚜害，已于十七日发布指示，责成各大行政区、各省人民政府组织农民，倡用烟草水喷洒除蚜的简易办法，及早防治，以遏止其发展。该指示号召各地领导农业生产的干部学会防治棉蚜技术，领导农民展开防治蚜虫的运动。农业部并已将喷雾器一万九千具分发华北各省。按棉花蚜害向来在我国极为普遍。被害棉花常减产百分之十到百分之二十。棉蚜五天即可繁殖一代，必须于发现时即早除治。解放区近年倡用烟草水（烟草一斤浸水五十到八十斤）、烟草石灰水（烟草生石灰各一斤浸水六十斤）或棉油皂（漂棉子油剩下的油渣子，加水一百倍即成，农民称之为黑胰子）喷洒杀蚜的办法，简易而有效。喷雾器不足时，尚可组织农民采用浸沾法予以药杀。
