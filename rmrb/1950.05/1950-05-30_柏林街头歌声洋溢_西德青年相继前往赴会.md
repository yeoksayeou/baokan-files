Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th, dispatch from TASS: The "Pravda" correspondent in Berlin, Korolkov, reports on the All-German Youth Peace Conference: From morning till night, the streets of Berlin are filled with songs and music. Tens of thousands of young German men and women have already arrived to attend the conference. Representatives from Saxony, Thuringia, and some cities in West Germany are also arriving successively. This conference is transforming into a moving demonstration for peace, national unity, and against the imperialist policies of the Western occupying powers.

German youth express their desire to be friends with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and to oppose war and endless provocations. This is precisely what international warmongers fear. Therefore, in West Germany, all reactionary forces, from constables to mercenary journalists, have been mobilized. The American authorities in West Berlin have increased the police force by several thousand. The police force is reinforced by American tanks and military police. The American headquarters, headed by Commander Taylor, has assumed leadership of the "defense." It is revealed that criminals and police have been prepared to wear the uniforms of the Free German Youth League to create incidents in the streets. All of this is used to intimidate German youth, forcing them to abandon their intention to participate in mass peace demonstrations. But they have not intimidated those attending the conference. During the preparation of the conference, the prestige of the Free German Youth League has become particularly high. In recent months, 300,000 young people have joined the League. Fifty-five percent of the youth in the German Democratic Republic are already members of the League. German youth have also obtained eight million signatures for the Great Committee's declaration banning atomic weapons.

　　柏林街头歌声洋溢
    西德青年相继前往赴会
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：真理报驻柏林记者科罗尔科夫报道全德青年和平大会称：自早到晚，柏林街头都充满歌声和乐声。成万德国青年男女已前来出席大会。萨克森、绍林吉亚以及西德一些城市中的代表，也正陆续前来。这大会正转变成为争取和平、国家统一和反对西方占领国家的帝国主义政策的动人示威。
    德国的青年们表示要和苏联及人民民主国家好友，反对战争与无休止的挑拨。这正是国际战争贩子所害怕的。因此，在西德境内，一切反动力量，从宪兵到唯利是图的记者，都动员起来。柏林西区美当局已将警察扩大了好几千人。警察部队得到美国坦克及宪兵的增援。以司令官泰勒为首的美国总部已承担“防御”的领导责任。据透露，罪犯和警察已准备穿上自由德国青年联盟的制服，在街头制造事件。所有这一切，都是用来恫吓德国青年，迫使他们放弃参加群众和平示威的本意。但是他们并没有吓倒参加大会的人。在大会筹备期间，自由德国青年联盟的威望变得特别高了。最近几个月，有三十万青年参加了联盟。德意志民主共和国境内的青年，已有百分之五十五是联盟的盟员。德国青年并已为和大常委会禁止原子武器的宣言征得了八百万人的签名。
