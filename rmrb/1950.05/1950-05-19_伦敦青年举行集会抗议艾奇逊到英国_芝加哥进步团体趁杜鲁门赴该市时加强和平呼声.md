　　Xinhua News Agency, May 17th: TASS, London: On the evening of May 15th, a youth rally was held in the Holborn district of London to protest the arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Acheson in London to attend the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting. Ivor Cooper, Executive Committee member of the British Communist Youth League, gave a speech at the rally, emphasizing that Acheson came to London to accelerate the implementation of the plan of U.S. Senator Kennan, who shamelessly said last year that European youth must be cannon fodder for American imperialists in a new war. Ivor Cooper said: British youth once again declare: British youth do not want to be cannon fodder, do not want to fight against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Many of the people who participated in the rally signed the Stockholm Appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace.
　　Xinhua News Agency, May 17th: TASS, New York, May 16th: The Daily Worker reported: As Truman arrived in Chicago, various progressive groups distributed many pamphlets and slogans calling for peace and urging the prohibition of atomic weapons in various districts of the city. Peace advocates posted thousands of large slogans on the walls of large factory areas. They wrote: "Chicago needs peace, end the Cold War! Fight for peace, ban the atomic bomb! The Hiroshima incident must not be repeated, ban the atomic bomb!". The Chicago branch of the Progressive Party distributed 100,000 pamphlets calling for peace.
　　Five hundred representatives from seventeen major Christian organizations gathered in Detroit. The meeting suggested that religious groups from all over the world work together to demand that their respective governments strive for peace and the prohibition of atomic weapons.
　　Students at the University of Wisconsin held a demonstration march calling for peace. The marchers carried signs with slogans such as "Ban the atomic bomb" and other anti-war slogans.
