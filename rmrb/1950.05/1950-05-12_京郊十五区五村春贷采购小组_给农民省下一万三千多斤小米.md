　　Spring Loan Procurement Team of Five Villages in Fifteen Districts of Beijing Suburbs
　　Saves Farmers Over 13,000 Catties of Millet
    After receiving loans for early-maturing crops (potatoes) from the supply and marketing cooperative, five villages in the fifteenth district of Beijing suburbs, under the leadership of the Fengtai Supply and Marketing Branch, organized a spring loan procurement team responsible for purchasing seeds. This team consisted of Han Wenlian, director of the Machang Village Cooperative, Zhou Yuqing, production committee member of Wuquan Village, Zhao Wanchun, production committee member of Liuquan Village, Chang Wanchun, production committee member of Baipenyao Village, and Liang Youqing from Guogongzhuang Village. Han Wenlian and Zhou Yuqing served as team leaders.
    On the afternoon of March 7th, the procurement team, carrying over 57 million yuan in cash, traveled by train from Fengtai Station to Teng County, Shandong, to purchase potato seeds. On March 19th, the procurement team returned victoriously, having purchased over 45,000 catties of potato seeds. Including transportation costs, the price per catty averaged 1,258 yuan. Compared to the local market price in Fengtai of 1,800 yuan to 2,300 yuan per catty, this was an average saving of two-fifths per catty, totaling over 13,000 catties of millet saved for the farmers. They also purchased over 18,000 catties more of potato seeds, enabling the planting of an additional 180 mu of land. With an average yield of 2,000 catties of potatoes per mu, this would result in an additional yield of 360,000 catties of potatoes. This not only responded to the government's call to increase production by 10%, but also ensured the dedicated use of agricultural loans.
    The five members of the procurement team worked very hard during those twelve days, busily buying goods, packing, and accounting, with very little rest time. Team leader Han Wenlian, despite suffering from hemorrhoids which made walking difficult, persisted in his work and overcame various difficulties. Their spirit of responsibility towards the farmers was supported by the farmers of the five villages.

　　京郊十五区五村春贷采购小组
　　给农民省下一万三千多斤小米
    京郊十五区五个村，在领到了供销社的早熟作物土豆贷款后，在丰台供销分社的领导之下，组织了一个春贷采购小组，负责采购种子。这个小组由马厂村合作社理事韩文连，五圈村生产委员周玉庆，六圈村生产委员赵万春，白盆窑村生产委员常万春，郭公庄村梁有庆五人组成。其中韩文连、周玉庆为组长。
    三月七日下午，采购组带着五千七百余万元现款，由丰台站乘火车到山东滕县，采买土豆种子。三月十九日采购组胜利回来，买回土豆种子四万五千多斤，连运费计算在内，每斤合价一千二百五十八元，与丰台当地市价每斤一千八百元至二千三百元相比，平均每斤便宜五分之二，共计给农民省下了一万三千多斤小米，多买了一万八千多斤土豆种子，能多种一八○亩地，平均每亩产土豆二、○○○斤，共可多产土豆三六○、○○○斤。这样，不仅响应了政府增产一成的号召，并保证了农贷的专款专用。
    十二天之内，采购组五个人是很辛苦的，他们每天忙着买货、打包、算帐，休息时间很少。组长韩文连虽有痔疮病，走路都不方便，但是仍然坚持工作，克服了各种困难。他们对农民负责的精神，得到了五个村农民的拥护。
