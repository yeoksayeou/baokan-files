Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 13th: A unit of the Northwest Military Region, comprising 25,000 personnel, after three months of active preparation, began construction on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway between April 20th and May 1st. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang government, civilian laborers were forcibly employed to build a rudimentary roadbed for this line. However, due to years of neglect, much of the roadbed was washed away by rain. This unit signed a road construction contract with the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government this year, resolutely undertaking the task of constructing this massive project. Before the commencement of construction, the unit organized three technical training classes, enabling approximately 500 people to learn basic techniques. The unit also conducted widespread road construction education. Most of the iron and wood tools, and dump trucks needed by each unit were manufactured by the soldiers themselves, with a small portion purchased. For example, one division wove approximately 12,000 bamboo baskets and made approximately 22,000 carrying poles and pickaxe handles. After the start of construction, the soldiers were very enthusiastic. One group of six people dug five cubic meters of earth in three hours. The trees along the line are covered with motivational slogans, and the soldiers cheerfully sing self-composed road-building songs. They sing: "Labor is glorious, everyone praises, strive to wear a big red flower."

　　西北军区某部开工修建天兰铁路
    【新华社兰州十三日电】西北军区某部二万五千人，经过三个月的积极准备，已于四月二十日至五月一日先后开工修建天（水）兰（州）铁路。国民党反动政府统治时期，曾强迫民工筑成该线路基雏形。但因年久失修，路基多为雨水冲毁。某部于今年与中央人民政府铁道部订立修路合同，毅然担负起建设此项巨大工程的任务。该部于开工前，曾举办三个技术训练班，使约五百人学会初级技术。该部曾普遍进行修路教育。各部所需之铁木工具、土车等，除购买一部外，大部由战士铸造完成。某师即编簸箕、筐子约一万二千个，制扁担、镐柄约两万二千个。开工后，战士们热情甚高。某组六个人，在三小时内就挖了五方土。沿线树木上都满贴鼓动标语，战士们愉快地唱着自编的修路歌。他们唱着：“劳动光荣人人夸，争取戴朵大红花。”
