Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, 13th. A frontline reporter's account of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Hainan Island states: In December of last year, after the Fourth Field Army and a unit of the Second Field Army cooperated to victoriously conclude the great encirclement and annihilation battle on the border of Guangdong and Guangxi, a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army accepted the glorious task of crossing the sea to liberate Hainan Island and immediately launched a large-scale maritime training movement. In the three months of maritime training, disregarding all difficulties and overcoming all difficulties, the warriors who had fought from the Songhua River to the Pearl River maintained high morale, holding the determination to conquer the ocean, annihilate the remaining enemies, and liberate Hainan Island, actively, enthusiastically, and humbly learning from the boatmen. In a very short period, commanders and fighters overcame the difficulties of insufficient vessels and unfamiliarity with water, learned nautical skills such as identifying wind direction, rowing, and steering, and also invented horizontal angle instruments and techniques for shooting on the water, mastering the tactics of maritime combat. Units and all commanders and fighters universally launched a wave of meritorious service in crossing the sea, vying to take on assault tasks and striving to become heroic units in amphibious operations.

When various preparations were completed, the People's Liberation Army amphibious force, with the active assistance of the boatmen, secretly crossed the Qiongzhou Strait in four batches in March, eliminating enemy warships and aircraft along the way, and successfully landing in Qiongdong, Qiongxi, and Qiongbei, quickly defeating the resistance of bandit troops on land and joining forces with the Qiongya Column, which had persisted in fighting behind enemy lines for a long time, creating extremely favorable conditions for subsequent large-scale amphibious operations.

On the evening of April 16, our powerful main force set sail southward from the southern end of the Leizhou Peninsula. For a time, sails covered the sea like a forest, and thousands of boats rode the wind and waves, crossing the 180-odd li of the Qiongzhou Strait, heading straight for Hainan Island.

During the journey, our fleet engaged in a naval gun battle with enemy ships all night. Commanders, fighters, and boatmen calmly steered their boats, braving the waves, and advancing bravely, breaking through the greatly touted so-called "Bo Ling Defense Line" of the remaining bandits in one fell swoop on the 17th, destroying the layers of fire nets of the enemy's sea, land, and air three-dimensional defense, successfully completing the landing north of Qiong Island ahead of the enemy, and immediately launching a large-scale advance, heading straight for the depths.

The Western Route Army, which landed around Bopu Port and Lingaojiao, defeated two regiments of the 131st Division of the enemy's 64th Army’s coastal defense forces and annihilated part of them, then headed straight for Chengmai City on the 19th.

The Eastern Route Army, which landed around Linshi Port and Shengyan Mountain, first surrounded Huachang and Maniao towns north of Chengmai to annihilate bandits. On the 18th, they occupied Fushan City, and then annihilated the headquarters of the 252nd Division of the bandits and parts of the 755th and 754th Regiments in the Meiting and Huangzhu areas, completing the encirclement of the enemy defending Chengmai.

The Kuomintang bandit army at this time felt that the situation was serious, and urgently mobilized six main regiments from Haikou to reinforce. A company of our army that held the 105 high ground of Fengmeiling repelled 13 joint infantry, artillery, and air assaults by the bandit army from morning to night, defeating three infantry regiments, one infantry artillery company, one mountain artillery company, and three mortar companies of the bandits. Our main force, enduring extreme fatigue, in direct coordination with the Qiongya Column, crossed and swept through enemy positions day and night, thoroughly smashing the enemy's point-line-depth defense. The bandit army in northern Qiong collapsed completely.

After the successive liberation of Lingao and Chengmai, our Eastern and Western Route Armies joined forces and headed straight for the bandit nest of Haikou City. On the 23rd, they occupied Haikou and Qiongshan, and on the 24th, they liberated Wenchang. By this time, our army had controlled the 400-li-long coastline in the east and west of northern Hainan Island, and quickly moved into the second stage of pursuit operations.

During our army's advance, the Han and Li peoples of northern Qiong, who had suffered long-term devastation by the bandit gangs, warmly welcomed the People's Liberation Army as if they were welcoming their own relatives. Wherever the army went, people of all ethnic groups set up tea stations and labor teams to welcome and see them off, and quickly raised grain and grass to support the advance of the army. Many Li compatriots even led cattle and sheep, carried pigs, and brought large quantities of fruits to the battlefield to comfort the troops. With the enthusiastic support of the people, the People's Liberation Army, pursuing the fleeing bandits in separate routes, was even more courageous, and everyone shouted, "Don't let the enemy escape by boat!"

Commanders and fighters braved the scorching heat and overcame the difficulty of the enemy bandits having robbed the grain along the way, pursuing day and night without stopping.

A part of the Eastern Route Army formed a rapid force with captured enemy vehicles and rushed to Yulin Port along the ring road. Another part, with a rapid march of more than 900 li in seven days and nights, crossed Qiongzhong and went straight to Wanning. On the 28th, our army even advanced at a speed of 150 li in one day and night, and liberated Lingshui on the morning of the 29th. Along the way, prisoners were everywhere, guns and weapons were scattered, and most of the remaining bandits surrendered. People everywhere assisted our army in capturing prisoners.

On April 30, our army reached the ports of Sanya and Yulin, and more than 2,000 remnants of the enemy's 62nd and 63rd Armies who had not had time to escape by boat were captured.

Our Western Route Army, starting from Chengmai in northern Qiong, advanced 600-odd li southward in six days and nights, and cooperated with the maritime pursuit force composed of amphibious gunboats, completely annihilating an entire division, the 286th Division, of the enemy's Fourth Army, and liberating the key port of Beili in western Qiong on April 30, capturing an enemy warship that had not had time to escape.

From April 17, when the People's Liberation Army successfully landed north of Qiong Island ahead of the enemy, to April 30, when Sanya, Yulin, and Beili were liberated, it took less than half a month to completely smash the enemy's three-dimensional sea, land, and air defenses and the point-line-depth defense, liberate the entire Qiongya Island, victoriously conclude the Hainan Campaign, and complete the glorious task of liberating all of Central and Southern China.

　　解放海南岛经过
　  我军渡海三路作战
　　半月解放海南全岛
　  完成解放中南全境任务
    【新华社海口十三日电】前线记者报道人民解放军第四野战军解放海南岛的经过称：去年十二月人民解放军第四野战军和第二野战军一部配合作战，胜利结束粤桂边大围歼战后，第四野战军某部即接受了渡海解放海南岛的光荣任务，并随即展开了海上大练兵运动。在不顾一切困难并克服一切困难的三个月海上大练兵中，从松花江打到珠江的勇士们，战志一直高涨、抱着征服海洋、歼灭残敌、解放海南岛的决心，积极、热情、虚心地向船工们学习。在很短的期间内，指战员们克服了船只不足、不懂水性的困难，学会了识别风向、划浆、掌舵等航海技术，还发明了水平角度器和水上射击要领，掌握了海上作战的战术。各单位和全体指战员们普遍掀起了跨海立功的热潮，纷纷要求担任突击任务，争取成为渡海作战的英雄部队。
    当各项准备工作相继完成时，人民解放军渡海部队即于三月间在船工们的积极协助下，分四批潜渡琼州海峡，沿途排除敌人军舰、飞机的阻挡，于琼东、琼西、琼北胜利登陆，迅速击溃陆上匪军抵抗，与长期坚持敌后斗争的琼崖纵队会师，给以后大规模的渡海作战创造了极为有利的条件。
    四月十六日晚，我强大主力部队从雷州半岛南端启航南渡，一时海上帆樯如林，千百只船乘风破浪，横渡一百八十余里的琼州海峡，直指海南岛。
    途中我船队与敌舰炮战通宵。指战员和船工们始终沉着驾船，冲涛踏浪，奋勇前进，于十七日一举突破残匪大吹大擂的所谓“伯陵防线”，摧毁匪军海陆空立体防御的层层火网，胜利完成琼岛北部的敌前登陆，并随即大举进军，直向纵深发展。
    由博铺港、临高角一带登陆的西路大军，击溃敌海防部队六十四军一三一师两个团并歼其一部后，十九日直指澄迈城。
    由林诗港、圣眼山一带登陆的东路大军，首先包围澄迈以北花场、马袅两市歼匪，十八日进占福山市，又于美亭、黄竹地区歼匪二五二师师部及七五五团、七五四团一部，完成对澄迈守敌的包围形势。
    国民党匪军此时顿感形势严重，急由海口调集六个主力团增援。坚守凤美岭一零五高地的我军一个连自早至晚打退匪军十三次步炮空联合冲锋，击溃匪三个步兵团、一个步兵炮连、一个山炮连、三个迫击炮连。而我主力部队则忍受极度的疲劳，在琼崖纵队的直接配合下，昼夜纵横穿插，扫荡敌阵，彻底粉碎了敌军的点线纵深防御。琼北匪军至此乃告全线崩溃。
    临高、澄迈两城相继解放后，我东西两路大军乃会师直取匪巢海口市，二十三日进占海口、琼山，二十四日解放文昌。至此，我军已控制海南岛北部东西长达四百里的海岸线，并迅即转入第二阶段的追击作战。
    在我军进军途中，遭受匪帮长期蹂躏的琼北汉族和黎族人民，像接待自己的亲人一样，热烈欢迎人民解放军。军行所至，各族人民到处设有茶水站、民工队欢迎接送，并迅速筹粮送草，支援大军前进。许多黎族同胞更牵着牛羊，抬着猪，携带大批水果，赶到战地劳军。在人民的热情支援下，分路追击逃匪的人民解放军更加勇气百倍，大家奋臂高呼：“不让敌人上船逃跑！”
    指战员们冒着酷热，克服沿途粮食被匪军抢光的困难，日夜不停地兼程追击。
    东路大军一部以缴自敌人的汽车组成快速部队，沿环岛公路向榆林港急进，另部则以七昼夜九百余里的急行军，越过琼中直趋万宁。二十八日，我军更以一昼夜急进一百五十里的速度，于二十九日晨解放陵水。沿途满山遍野俘虏成群，枪械狼籍，残匪大部束手就擒。各地人民均纷纷协助我军捕捉俘虏。
    四月三十日，我军进抵三亚、榆林两港，未及上船逃跑之敌六十二军、六十三军残部二千余人悉数被俘。
    我西路大军由琼北澄迈出发，六昼夜南进六百余里，并与渡海炮艇组成的海上追击部队配合作战，全歼匪第四军二八六师一个整师，于四月三十日解放琼西要港北黎，俘获未及逃跑的敌舰一艘。
    人民解放军自四月十七日在琼北敌前胜利登陆至四月三十日解放三亚、榆林、北黎为止，历时不足半月，即彻底粉碎匪海陆空军的立体防御与点线纵深防御，解放琼崖全岛，胜利地结束了海南战役，完成了解放中南全境的光荣任务。
