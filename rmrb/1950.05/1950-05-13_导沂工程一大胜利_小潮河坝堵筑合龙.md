　　A Great Victory for the Yi River Diversion Project
　　Closure of the Xiaochao River Dam

    [Shanghai News] According to the Xinwen Ribao (News Daily): The Xiaochao River Dam in the estuary section of the New Yi River in Guanyun County has been closed after several tenacious attempts. This project started at 6:00 AM on April 29th. Work began at 7:30 AM, and the "dragon gate" (a layered structure of firewood and soil bundles) settled at the bottom at 10:30 AM. However, the water seepage was significant, so rubble was quickly poured to reinforce both the north and south flanks (pouring: adding stone and earth to both sides of the dam body to increase its resistance). The dragon gate was weighted with additional soil. By 12:30 PM, the stone flanks were completed, using approximately 900 cubic meters of stone to stop the leakage. At this time, the water level above the dam was 1.61 meters above the datum, while the tide below the dam had dropped to 0.62 meters below the datum, a difference of 2.23 meters between the upstream and downstream water levels. Stone flank reinforcement continued at that time and at 2:00 PM, the tide below the dam turned, reaching its lowest point at 0.98 meters below the datum. The water above the dam continued to rise by five centimeters, resulting in a difference of 2.64 meters, fortunately remaining safe. Another 4,000 workers were mobilized in the afternoon to rush the construction of earth flanks. By 6:00 PM, the tide below the dam had risen to 2.429 meters above the datum, while the water level above the dam was 1.77 meters above the datum, a difference of 0.72 meters. The dam body showed no signs of danger, but the water above the dam continued to rise at an average rate of two to three centimeters per hour. In addition to raising the Xiaochao River dam body, it is planned to send personnel to urgently block the Wan Gong River to cut off its source. Thus, the initial closure of the Xiaochao River Dam has been successfully completed.

    Note: The success or failure of this dam is a crucial key to whether the New Yi River can be drained this year. The successful completion of the closure project represents a glorious victory in the entire Yi River Diversion Project. The dam construction site is located at the Toudukou, between the Cenchi and Mangniu districts of Guanyun County. It officially commenced in late November of last winter. During the construction process, the dam head was washed away three times due to tidal fluctuations, but the strong confidence of the Party and government cadres in the construction remained unshaken. In addition to Director Tang of the Subei Yi River Diversion Project Office and engineers Jiang Xingxiao and Wu Ketang going deep into the work sections to provide personal guidance, Vice Secretary Wan of the CCP Subei District Committee, Deputy Minister Qian of the Water Conservancy Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, and Commander and Political Commissar Li Guangren of the Subei Yi River Diversion Headquarters all personally supervised the dam construction site. The East China Military and Political Committee also mobilized technicians from the Shandong River Affairs Bureau to participate in this dam construction project.

    The Huaihai Bao (Huaihai Newspaper) has specially written an article to celebrate this achievement and to pay tribute to the participating workers and engineering personnel.

　　导沂工程一大胜利
　　小潮河坝堵筑合龙
    【上海讯】据新闻日报消息：灌云县新沂河入海段小潮河坝，经过顽强不屈的数次堵筑后，已堵筑合龙。这次工程系于四月二十九日早六时开始，工作七时半开厢，十时半龙门占（占：是层柴层土捆起来的工程）着底；惟窜水甚涌，赶用块石浇筑南北两戗（浇：是在坝身两面加石加土，增加坝身抵抗力），龙门占加压大土，十二时半石戗完成，用石块约九百公方漏水方止。这时坝上存水水位真高一点六一公尺，坝下潮水跌至真高零下零点六二公尺，上下游水位相差二点二三公尺。当时继续加强石戗，至午后二时，坝下潮水回潮，最枯为零下零点九八公尺，坝上续涨五公分，上下相差二点六四公尺，幸能安全。下午另调民工四千人赶浇土戗，至下午六时坝下潮水涨至真高二点四二九公尺，坝内存水真高为一点七七公尺，相差为零点七二公尺，坝身未有险象，惟坝上水每小时平均续涨二、三公分不等。现除加高小潮河坝身外，拟派员前往抢堵万公河，以绝来源。至此小潮河坝堵筑合龙初步告成。
    按：该坝成败是本年新沂河能否放水的重要关键，此次得能完成合龙工程，实为整个导沂工程中，一个辉煌的胜利。该段坝工堵筑在灌云县岑池区与莽牛区之间的头渡口上。从去冬十一月下旬正式开工。在筑堵中由于潮水涨落冲击，坝头曾连被冲塌三次，但党、政干部对筑堵的坚强信心，毫未动摇。除苏北导沂工程处汤处长与蒋兴孝、武可棠等工程师均深入工段，亲自指导外，中共苏北区党委万副书记和华东军政委员会水利部钱副部长、苏北导沂司令部司令兼政委李广仁同志，全亲临该段坝工实地督导；华东军政委员会并曾调集山东河务局技工参加此次筑坝工程。
    淮海报为此特撰专文庆祝，并向参加的民工与工程人员致敬。
