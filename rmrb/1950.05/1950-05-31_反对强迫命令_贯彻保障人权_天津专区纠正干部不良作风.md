　　Oppose Coercive Orders, Implement and Guarantee Human Rights
    Tianjin Special District Corrects Cadres' Unwholesome Work Styles
    [Our Newspaper Tianjin News] Since November of last year, Tianjin Special District has vigorously corrected cadres' coercive work styles and the errors of infringing upon human rights. In the year and more since liberation, cadres at all levels in the district have strived to implement the policies and decrees of the People's Government and the Communist Party, and have carried out arduous and complex tasks during various periods. In tasks such as grain requisition, flood prevention, and production and disaster relief last year, many cadres were able to correctly grasp policy principles, maintain a hard-working and simple work style, and mobilize the masses in a democratic way to complete their tasks. However, some cadres still have remnants of "privilege" thinking and treat the masses in an erroneous and undemocratic manner. Among the new district- and village-level cadres in the district, most have a low level of policy understanding and a simple work style. Coupled with insufficient education and assistance from superiors, the phenomena of coercive orders and infringement of human rights have become quite widespread. In addition, some cadres, especially district and village cadres, still exhibit a state of anarchy and lack of discipline, handling cases without following legal procedures, failing to seek instructions beforehand, and failing to report afterward, even abusing their power and handling matters arbitrarily. There are also individual cadres who are impure in character and violate policies and decrees for personal gain, infringing upon the interests of the masses. According to statistics from Ninghe County, a total of 111 incidents of cadres arbitrarily beating, detaining, and fining people, infringing upon human rights, occurred last year. The vast majority of these cadres who violated policies belonged to the public security and armed cadres at the district and village levels (accounting for more than 60 percent). The reason for these incidents was, in 60 percent of the cases, simply the result of adopting coercive measures to complete tasks. Whenever a superior assigned an urgent task, incidents of infringement of human rights occurred, especially during the flood prevention period last year. He Chunze, the district head of the Seventh District of Tianjin County, detained 49 people in more than 40 days.
    At the beginning of November last year, the people's representative conferences and the Communist Party representative conferences were successively held in various counties and towns of Tianjin Special District. The conferences proposed to implement the democratic spirit and oppose the work style of coercive orders; some counties also accepted the recommendations of the conferences and punished cadres who had seriously infringed upon human rights. In December, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party issued instructions on guaranteeing human rights. The Tianjin District Committee successively delivered reports at cadre meetings, which aroused the attention of various counties and towns. Wen'an and Jinghai conducted in-depth education in party member training classes, and listed the protection of human rights as one of the important contents for cadres' evaluation, merit recording and demerit recording in the work of production and disaster relief. In March of this year, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party issued supplementary instructions on guaranteeing human rights. The Tianjin District Committee once again conveyed the instructions at a joint meeting of county party secretaries and county heads, and issued instructions that the directives on correcting coercive orders and guaranteeing human rights have begun to be widely and deeply implemented.
    First, the counties and districts examined the ideology of the cadres, generally from top to bottom, with the county taking departments as units and the district taking work teams as units. During the examination, they corrected the erroneous idea of some cadres who believed that "work cannot be promoted without beating and detaining," educated the cadres to understand the spirit of the policy, and mobilized everyone to conduct self-criticism and discussion. Second, they stipulated the legal procedures for handling cases, delineated the scope of authority, and carried out education in conjunction with ideological examination, instructing every party member cadre to set an example and ensure implementation. They also educated all cadres that everyone has the responsibility to supervise and stop acts of infringing upon human rights and to educate lower-level cadres on guaranteeing human rights. Third, while clearing up the backlog of cases in the public security and judicial departments, the counties also seized the opportunity to appropriately handle incidents of infringement of human rights. For example, Jinghai and Dacheng counties, based on the principle of convicting the guilty and releasing the innocent, handled 383 backlog cases and newly received cases in April and May, accounting for 92 percent of the total number of old detainees and new cases received this year. At present, it has generally been achieved that cases are not backlogged, and the arrest procedures are more cautious and strict than before. On the other hand, the counties combined policy education to appropriately handle cadres who infringed upon human rights. Those with serious circumstances were given disciplinary action by the Party Committee and the government respectively, while those who committed general coercive order errors and whose circumstances were not serious were given criticism and education. Appropriate compensation was made for the losses suffered by the masses due to the infringement by the cadres. And the cadres who made mistakes were made to publicly examine their mistakes at cadre meetings, representative meetings or mass meetings in their local villages.
    Now, the work style of cadres in the special district has undergone great changes, and the phenomenon of infringement of human rights has basically stopped. The masses are all satisfied. It has also educated the masses, and everyone knows that "it is illegal to beat people." Some people dare not even raise a hand in serious quarrels.
    The current problems are that the work style of individual cadres has not been completely changed, and the phenomenon of disguised detention has occurred in some districts and villages, calling on lower-level cadres or the masses to "reflect"; some cadres have a low level of policy understanding and lack working methods, and after correcting coercive orders, they still lack correct working methods and experience, and therefore feel depressed and unable to promote work. In addition, individual cadres cannot clearly distinguish between guaranteeing human rights and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and therefore dare not boldly carry out their work, and even dare not deal with destructive and disruptive acts by reactionary elements. These still need long-term and in-depth education. (Based on the report of the Tianjin District Committee on May 22)

　　反对强迫命令·贯彻保障人权
    天津专区纠正干部不良作风
    【本报天津讯】天津专区自去年十一月以来，大力纠正干部强迫命令的作风与侵犯人权的错误。该区在解放后的一年多的时期中，各级干部努力推行了人民政府与共产党的政策法令，进行了各个时期繁重复杂的工作。如去年的征粮、防汛、生产救灾等工作中，许多干部都能正确掌握政策原则，保持艰苦朴素的作风，以民主方式深入发动群众来完成任务。但一部分干部仍有“特权”思想的残余，以错误的不民主方式对待群众。该区区、村级新干部中，多数政策水平低，工作方式单简，加之上级对他们的教育帮助不够，因此相当普遍地产生了强迫命令与侵犯人权现象。此外，在某些干部，特别是区、村干部中，还存在着无政府无纪律状态，处理案件不按法令手续，事先不请示，事后不报告，甚至滥用职权，擅自处理。也有个别干部品质不纯，为个人利益而违犯政策法令，侵犯群众利益的。据宁河县统计，去年共发生干部乱打、乱扣、乱罚等侵犯人权事件一百一十一次。这些违犯政策的干部，绝大部分属于区、村级的公安、武装干部（占百分之六十以上）。发生这些事件的原因，百分之六十是单纯地为了完成任务而采取强迫命令方式的结果。每当上级交下一个紧急任务时，侵犯人权事件就发生了，尤以去年防汛期间为甚，天津县七区区长何春泽，在四十多天内扣押群众达四十九人。
    去年十一月初，天津专区各县、镇先后召开了各界人民代表会和中共党代表会，会上提出要贯彻民主精神，反对强迫命令的作风；有的县并接受会议建议，处分了严重侵犯人权的干部。十二月，中共河北省委发布了保障人权的指示，天津地委先后在干部会议上作了传达报告，引起了各县、镇的重视，文安、静海并在党员训练班中进行了深入教育，且将保障人权列为生产救灾工作中干部评功记过的重要内容之一。今年三月，中共河北省委发出了关于保障人权的补充指示，天津地委再一次在各县县委书记与县长联席会议上进行了传达，并发出指示，各地对纠正强迫命令，保障人权的指示，已开始普遍深入地贯彻执行。
    首先，各县、区检查了干部的思想，一般是由上而下，县以部门为单位，区以工作组为单位进行。检查中，纠正了一部分干部认为“不打不扣，不能推动工作”的错误思想，教育干部领会政策精神，并发动大家进行了检讨和讨论。其次，规定了处理案件的法令手续，划分了权限范围，并结合思想检查进行了教育，责成每个党员干部以身作则，保证执行。并教育各干部：人人有监督与制止侵犯人权行为和向下级干部进行保障人权教育的责任。第三，各县一面清理公安、司法部门的积案，一面对侵犯人权事件抓紧进行适当的处理。如静海、大城两县根据有罪者判罪，无罪者释放的原则，在四、五两月处理了积案与新收案件三百八十三件，占去年旧押与今年新收案件总数的百分之九十二。目前一般已做到不积压案件，逮捕手续也较前慎重严格了。另一方面，各县结合进行政策教育，对侵犯人权干部进行了适当的处理。情节严重的由党委和政府分别给以处分，对一般犯强迫命令错误，情节不严重的干部则进行了批评教育。对群众因干部侵犯所损失的利益的则作了适当的补偿。并使犯错误的干部在各级干部会，代表会或当地村庄的群众大会上公开检讨错误。
    现在，该专区干部作风已大有转变，基本上停止了侵犯人权的现象。群众都感到满意。而且也教育了群众，大家知道了“打人犯法”，有的人在严重口角中也不敢动手打人了。
    目前存在的问题，是个别干部的作风还未彻底改变，有的区、村发生了变相扣押的现象，叫下级干部或群众去“反省”；有的干部政策水平低，工作方法少，纠正了强迫命令之后，正确的工作方法经验还很缺乏，因而感到苦闷，推不动工作。另有个别干部对保障人权与镇压反革命分辨不清，因而不敢大胆进行工作，甚至对反动分子破坏捣乱的行为也不敢处理。这些，仍待长期地深入地进行教育。（根据天津地委五月二十二日报告）
