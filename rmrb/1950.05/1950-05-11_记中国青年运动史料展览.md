　　A Record of the Exhibition of Historical Materials on the Chinese Youth Movement
　　By our reporter Bai Sheng

　　"A single spark can start a prairie fire," this is Chairman Mao's glorious evaluation of the great "May Fourth" Movement, and it also serves as the title of the first exhibit in this historical exhibition.

　　From one thousand and fifty photographs and two thousand and fifty-three artifacts, one can clearly see how Chinese youth were persecuted and ravaged by imperialism, the Northern Warlords, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. One can also see how Chinese youth, under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, advanced on the path of struggle.

　　From these exhibits, we first see the outbreak of the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919. At that time, the Jiuguo Daily (Save the Nation Daily) published the Shandong issue in a prominent place, and revolutionary youth put forward the slogan of overthrowing the traitors Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang, and Lu Zongyu. Progressive youth organizations, led by the martyr Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, such as the Peking University Marxist Theory Research Society, were established. Progressive magazines such as New Youth, New Tide, and Yu Si appeared one after another. Representatives of the New Culture, such as Qu Qiubai and Lu Xun, all took up the battle.

　　Then came the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party and the vigorous development of the revolutionary labor movement. From the photos, we can see that in 1922, the Chinese working class demonstrated to the imperialists for the first time with heroic posture - that was the first great Hong Kong Seamen's Strike. On February 7, 1923, the warlord Wu Peifu massacred the representatives of the founding meeting of the Beijing-Hankou Railway General Labor Union, with thirty-nine workers brutally killed and more than three hundred workers injured. And the fighting "Chinese Youth" was also founded in the same year. The tide of the Chinese revolution finally surged. The great May Thirtieth Movement broke out in 1925. On March 18, 1926, the reactionary warlord Duan Qirui's massacre of students aroused strong protests. All these grand scenes are vividly expressed here.

　　Since the May Thirtieth Movement, the reactionary forces of imperialism have launched even more frenzied attacks on the Chinese people, but the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people have also been growing stronger day by day. From the photos, we can see the historical traces of the Wuhan workers, under the leadership of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, heroically expelling the British imperialist patrolmen in the concession and occupying the British concession in 1927. The Shanghai workers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, launched three armed uprisings to occupy Shanghai in coordination with the Northern Expeditionary Army, as well as the bloody facts of Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution and the "April 12th" massacre.

　　But the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people would never yield. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, they raised the banner of revolution, launched armed resistance, established revolutionary base areas, created the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and preserved and developed the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people. In the photos, we see the scene of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army during the Nanchang Uprising led by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De on August 1, 1927. We also see the group photo of Chairman Mao and his comrades when the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army was established during the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. We saw the road that the great Chinese Red Army had struggled through, and various documents from the land revolution—the Soviet period, including the 1933 Red Army member registration form, as well as pictures of leaflets printed by the Communist Youth League in Beijing at that time. Then came the great 25,000-li Long March, and photos of the December 9th Student Movement in 1935. Then we saw that during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang was busy compromising and surrendering to the Japanese invaders, undermining the national united front, and we also saw the great achievements of the people in the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines in heroically persisting in the war under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Look! Here are the guerrillas fighting hard behind enemy lines, the close cooperation between the army and the people, and the brilliant victories they have achieved. Here are the heroic figures who created war miracles: the five warriors on Langya Mountain, the young explosives hero Li Yong, and the Wild Goose Team on Baiyangdian Lake. What makes people even more excited is the bayonet inserted into the enemy's heart - the militia, all organized everywhere.

　　We also saw many progressive young people who went to the revolutionary holy land - Yan'an. In the mountain valleys, they grew up strong, were nurtured by the revolution, recognized the direction of serving the workers, peasants and soldiers, and lived in a fighting environment. In a vivid photo of young people enthusiastically studying, I saw Chairman Mao standing there kindly, tirelessly explaining revolutionary theory to the young people.

　　We saw the heroic struggles of the broad masses of youth in the Kuomintang-controlled areas during the Liberation War. Here are photos of the Kunming "December 1st" student movement, photos of the "June 23rd" anti-civil war and peace demonstration of 100,000 people in Shanghai, anti-violence (anti-American imperialism) movements of students in various places, and the "May 20th" anti-hunger and anti-civil war parade. This bloody hatred will forever be deeply remembered in the hearts of young people.

　　And in the liberated areas, under the banner of Chairman Mao, we saw young workers, peasants, and students joining the army in large numbers. They gloriously and bravely went to the battlefield. At the same time, the broad masses of people in the liberated areas enthusiastically launched support-the-front work. They braved the rain of bullets, regardless of hunger, cold, wind and snow, and transported grain to the front lines. This made a series of victorious advance reports come one after another. Photos of the liberation of Northeast China, the liberation of Pingjin, the liberation of Ninghu, the liberation of Northwest China, and the liberation of Southwest China are all displayed there. What is even more exciting are the large numbers of weapons and other spoils of war seized by the People's Liberation Army from the enemy, which are placed in the exhibition room.

　　Other scenes, such as the joyous farming of the emancipated peasants on their own allocated land, the victory meeting of Chinese youth in Beijing after liberation and the birth of the New Democratic Youth League, and the close embrace of the democratic youth of various countries in the world, headed by the Soviet Union, with the Chinese youth... are all vividly expressed in this exhibition room.

　　In the cities and countryside after liberation, we saw Chinese young men and women, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Youth League, actively producing and studying in various posts, promoting the construction of the new China. Especially the young workers, who showed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and outstanding wisdom. From the exhibition, we can see many new tools created by Chinese young workers.

　　记中国青年运动史料展览
    本报记者　柏生
    “星星之火可以燎原”，这是毛主席给伟大的“五四”运动的光荣评价，同时，成为这次史展的首幅标题。
    从一千零五十张照片和两千零五十三件实物中，可以清楚看出，三十年来中国青年怎样受帝国主义、北洋军阀以及国民党反动派的迫害摧残，也可以看到中国青年在中国共产党的坚强领导下，怎样在战斗的道路上前进。
    从这些展览品中，首先我们看到了一九一九年“五四”运动的爆发，当时救国日报以首要篇幅刊载山东问题，革命青年提出了打倒卖国贼曹汝霖、章宗祥、陆宗舆的口号。以中国共产党创始人之一的李大钊先烈为首的北大马克思学说研究会等进步青年组织成立了。新青年、新潮、语丝等进步杂志相继出现。新文化的代表人物瞿秋白、鲁迅等一一出师战斗。
    接着是中国共产党的成立，革命职工运动的蓬勃展开。从照片中，我们可以看到一九二二年，中国工人阶级第一次以英勇的姿态向帝国主义者示威，——那是香港海员第一次大罢工。一九二三年二月七日，军阀吴佩孚屠杀京汉铁路总工会成立大会的代表，有三十九名工人惨遭杀害，三百余工人受伤。而战斗的《中国青年》也在同年创刊了。中国革命的热潮终于澎湃起来。一九二五年爆发了伟大的五卅运动。一九二六年三月十八日，反动军阀段祺瑞屠杀学生激起了强烈的抗议运动。这一切轰轰烈烈的场面都在这里获得鲜明的表现。
    自五卅以来，帝国主义反动势力更疯狂的向中国人民进攻，但中国人民革命的力量也日益增强。从照片上我们可以看到，一九二七年武汉工人在刘少奇同志领导下，英勇驱逐英帝国主义在租界的巡捕，并占领英租界的战斗史迹，上海工人在中国共产党的领导下为配合北伐军北上，举行三次武装起义占领上海的情形，以及蒋介石叛变革命，进行“四、一二”大屠杀的血腥事实。
    但中国共产党与中国人民是决不会屈服的，在毛泽东同志的领导下，高举起了革命的大旗，举行了武装反抗，建立了革命根据地，创造了中国工农红军，保存并发展了中国人民的革命力量。在照片中，我们看到了一九二七年八月一日朱德总司令领导下的南昌暴动时的工农红军的情景。我们也看到了一九二七年秋收暴动成立工农革命军时，毛主席和他的战友们的合影。我们看到了中国伟大红军艰苦战斗过来的道路，看到土地革命——苏维埃时期的各种文件，其中有一九三三年红军中团员登记表，以及当时共产主义青年团在北京印发的传单图片。接着是伟大的二万五千里长征，以及一九三五年一二九学生运动的照片。于是我们又看到在八年的抗日战争中，国民党忙于对日寇妥协、投降，破坏民族统一战线的丑态，也看到敌后抗日根据地的人民在中国共产党和毛主席、朱总司令的领导下，英勇地坚持抗战的伟绩。看罢！这里是游击队在敌后艰苦斗争，军民密切合作，获得了辉煌的胜利。这里是创造战争奇迹的英雄雄姿：狼牙山上的五战士，年青的爆炸英雄李勇，还有那白洋淀上的雁翎队，更使人看得兴奋的是那插在敌人心脏里的刺刀——民兵队，一处处的都组织起来了。
    我们也看到了许多进步的青年，纷纷去到革命的圣地——延安。在山沟里，他们结实的成长起来，受着革命的熏陶，认识了为工农兵服务的方向，生活在战斗的环境中。在一张生动的青年群众热烈学习的照片中，我更看到了毛主席亲切地站在那里，毫不疲倦地向青年们讲解革命的理论。
    我们看到在解放战争中，国民党统治区广大青年英勇斗争的场面。这里有昆明“一二、一”学生运动的照片，有上海“六、二三”的十万群众反内战要和平大示威的照片，各地学生的抗暴（反美帝）运动以及“五、二○”反饥饿、反内战大游行等等的照片。这血的仇恨将永远深深地记在青年人的心里。
    而在解放区，在毛主席的旗帜下，我们看到青年工人、农民、学生大批参军的情形。他们是这样光荣勇敢的走上了战场。而同时广大的解放区人民，更热烈地展开了支前工作。他们冒着枪林弹雨，不顾饥寒风雪，把粮食运到火线。这使一连串的胜利进军的捷报纷纷袭来。解放东北、解放平津、解放宁沪、解放西北、解放西南……的照片一一陈列在那里。更令人觉得兴奋的，是那些摆在展览室中的人民解放军从敌人手中夺取过来的大批武器和其他战利品。
    其他如翻身农民愉快地在自己分得的土地上耕种的情景，北京解放后，中国青年胜利大会师和新民主主义青年团诞生的情景，以苏联为首的世界各国民主青年与中国青年紧抱在一起的情景……都在这展览室里获得生动的表现。
    在解放后的城市和农村中，我们看到了中国的男女青年，在共产党与青年团的领导下，在各种岗位上积极的生产和学习，推进着新中国的建设。尤其是青年工人，更表现了高度的劳动热情，和卓越的智慧。从展览中，我们可以看到许多中国青年工人创制的新工具。
