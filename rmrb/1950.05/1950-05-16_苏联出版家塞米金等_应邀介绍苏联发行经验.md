　　Soviet Publishers Semykin and Others
　  Invited to Introduce Soviet Distribution Experience
    [This newspaper reported] The head office of Xinhua Bookstore recently held a tea party, inviting Mr. Semykin, Deputy General Manager of the Soviet International Bookstore, Mr. Golyev, representative of the Soviet International Book Company in China, and others to introduce the experience of the Soviet book and periodical distribution work. Mr. Semykin said: The characteristics of Soviet distribution work are the high degree of unified management and the universal and in-depth distribution network. The Soviet government has a Ministry of Publishing, Printing, and Distribution, under which a Distribution Administration is set up, with branches and offices in various provinces and states, which are responsible for the national distribution work. There are about 2,000 bookstores directly under the Distribution Administration, as well as cooperatives and newsstands all over the country. The main task of the Soviet distribution work is to find ways to actively deliver books and periodicals to locations close to the working masses. Therefore, in addition to setting up a large number of newsstands, a large number of mobile supply teams are also organized. According to the statistics in 1949, there were about 10,000 staff members in this mobile supply team. After introducing the Soviet distribution work, Mr. Semykin also put forward many suggestions for improving the work of the China International Bookstore in distributing Soviet books and periodicals.

　　苏联出版家塞米金等
　  应邀介绍苏联发行经验
    【本报讯】新华书店总管理处于日前举行茶话会，邀请苏联国际书店副总经理塞米金先生，苏联国际图书公司驻华代表郭尔结耶夫先生等介绍苏联书刊发行工作的经验。塞米金先生谈：苏联发行工作的特点是管理上的高度统一集中和发行网的普遍深入。苏联政府中设有出版、印刷、发行部，下面设立一个发行管理局，在各省各州设有分局和处，主管全国的发行工作。直属于发行管理局的书店有二千个左右，还有合作社和书亭遍布全国各地。苏联发行工作的主要任务，是设法主动输送书刊至接近劳动群众的地点，因而除设立大量的书亭外，还组织有大量的流动供应队。据一九四九年的统计，这种流动供应队的工作人员就有一万人左右。塞米金先生介绍苏联的发行工作后，又对目前中国国际书店发行苏联书刊的工作提出了许多改进的意见。
