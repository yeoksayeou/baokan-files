　　Zhang Mo
　　On November 21st of last year, the Second People's Representative Conference of Beijing passed the important resolution to "Close Down Brothels." The Beijing municipal authorities, the Municipal Women's Federation, and other relevant units then began to implement the work of resettling and reforming prostitutes in a step-by-step and planned manner. Since then, Beijing's "daughters of pleasure" have been emancipated, and women who were humiliated and trampled upon in the old society have stood up. This is an important measure in New Beijing. This time, the film "The Story of a Prostitute's Emancipation," jointly produced by comrades and students from the Beijing Film Studio and the Beijing Production and Education Center, chronicles this event.
　　"The Story of a Prostitute's Emancipation" not only exposes the cannibalistic crimes of the old society and old system but also focuses on portraying every specific link in the learning and transformation process of prostitutes turning into new laboring women, writing about how they move from unawareness to awareness after jumping out of the fire pit, recognizing their own path, and walking towards glorious production posts.
　　This is an artistic documentary. During filming, real people participated in the performance, so the actors were able to sincerely express the characters' emotions and handle the life themes in a simple way. This film is a new attempt in terms of form and creative methods, and it has a certain significance in the creation of news films. (Attached image)

　　《烟花女儿翻身记》
    张默
    去年十一月二十一日，在北京市第二届各界代表会议上，通过了“封闭妓院”的重要决议，北京市政机关与市妇联等有关单位，即有步骤有计划地展开了安置与改造妓女的工作。从此，北京的“烟花女儿”翻了身，旧社会被凌辱被践踏的妇女站立起来。这是新北京的一件重要措施。这一次，北影及北京生产教养院的工作同志及学员们共同摄制的影片《烟花女儿翻身记》，就是记述这件事的。
    《烟花女儿翻身记》，不但揭露了旧社会旧制度的吃人的罪恶，并着重地表现了由妓女转变为新生劳动妇女这一个学习改造过程中的每一个具体环节，写出她们跳出火坑后，怎样由不觉悟到觉悟，认清了自己的道路，而走到光荣的生产岗位上。
    这是一部艺术性记录片，摄制时，由真人参加表演，因而演员都能真挚地表现了角色情感，朴素地处理了生活题材。这部影片，在形式上，在创作方法上都是一个新的尝试，在新闻电影的创作上有其一定的意义。（附图片）
