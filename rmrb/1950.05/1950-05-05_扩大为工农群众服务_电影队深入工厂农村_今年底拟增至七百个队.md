　　Expanding Service to Workers and Peasants
    Film Projection Teams Penetrate Factories and Rural Areas
    Number Planned to Increase to 700 by End of Year
    [Our Dispatch] In order to establish and expand film projection work among workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government will greatly increase the number of projection teams this year. Currently, there are already more than 70 projection teams showing films in various units of the People's Liberation Army. The six film management companies under the bureau in North China, East China, Northeast China, Northwest China, Central South China, and Southwest China also have more than 20 projection teams. North China, East China, Northeast China and other places have successively dispatched projection teams to factories and rural areas for experimental screenings to gain work experience. The bureau will soon open projection training classes to prepare personnel to complete the plan to increase the number of projection teams to 700 by the end of this year.
    Showing Films in Factories and Countryside, Workers and Peasants Enthusiastically Welcome
    According to the experimental screenings in factories and rural areas by the projection teams directly dispatched by the bureau, the broad masses of workers and peasants are extremely welcoming of films, and the educational effect is great. The projection team successively screened "Boundless Radiance" 13 times in factories in Tianjin, Shijingshan, Changxindian, Fengtai, etc., with an audience of more than 15,000 people; and in 33 film screenings in ten counties of Hebei Province such as Xushui, Dingxing, and Baoding City (including eight screenings in rural areas, 22 in small towns, and three in small cities. The films included "The Birth of New China", "Democratic Northeast, Compilation No. 10", "Boundless Radiance", Beijing Film Documentary No. 4, etc.), the audience reached more than 140,000 people. Whenever the projection team arrived in a village, residents from nearby villages and towns came to see the film. They crowded the projection site, even climbing on nearby highlands, walls, roofs, and trees to watch. In Yi County, three farmers spontaneously brought white flour and pork to慰劳(wèi láo - express sympathy and solicitude for) the projection team. The film had a profound impact on the farmers: after watching "The Birth of New China", everyone excitedly ran around telling each other: "We finally saw Chairman Mao!" revealing their boundless love for the people's leader. When they saw the scene of electing village power in the tenth compilation of "Democratic Northeast," the whole audience erupted in thunderous cheers. After seeing the spinning mill, they said, "We used to be afraid of not being able to sell cotton. Now we know that no matter how much we grow, it is not enough." What particularly interested the farmers was the tractor in Beijing Film No. 4, and everyone talked about hoping to use it one day.
    Workers and Peasants Offer Opinions, Hoping for Improvement in Film Work
    After the screenings in various places, the projection team held several symposiums with workers and peasants to solicit their opinions. Workers and peasants almost unanimously hoped that they would go to them more often for screenings. Many workers felt that the film "Boundless Radiance" had great enlightenment and educational effect, but also raised many opinions. Farmers and rural cadres expressed that they liked to watch newsreels; they hoped that the film content would include rural activities: such as reflecting the rural production situation, the deeds of rural labor heroes, as well as films with content on improving agricultural technology and organizing mutual aid, breaking superstitions and the remnants of feudal ideas. Farmers requested that the camera transitions in the films be slower; the story should have continuity, the plot should be simple, and it is best to narrate from beginning to end in its entirety. Moreover, they hoped that the screening time would be longer, because it was not easy for them to watch a film once. "Boundless Radiance" was also extremely welcomed by farmers when it was screened in rural areas. Cadres reflected: "This film is very helpful in helping farmers understand the working class."
    In the experimental screenings, the projection team gained preliminary work experience. For example, before going to factories and rural areas, they should establish close contact with the factory's trade union, administration, and rural local governments to help solve problems in the screenings, especially in rural screenings, because there are so many audiences, so it is necessary to choose appropriate screening locations and pay attention to maintaining order. Before the screening, publicity should be done through newspapers, wall newspapers, rooftop broadcasts, etc., and popular leaflets should be printed and distributed to help workers and peasants understand the plot. After the screening, opinions should be widely solicited, and timely inspections should be carried out to improve the work.
    Currently, the most difficult problem in going to rural areas for screenings is transportation. The projection team must carry projectors, generators, and repair and inspection personnel to the countryside. Transporting to and from rural areas with large trucks not only delays time but also easily damages the parts.

### 扩大为工农群众服务  电影队深入工厂农村  今年底拟增至七百个队

　　扩大为工农群众服务
    电影队深入工厂农村
    今年底拟增至七百个队
    【本报讯】中央人民政府文化部电影局为建立与扩大工、农、兵中间的电影放映工作，本年内将大量增加放映队。目前，全国已有七十余个放映队在人民解放军各部队中放映。该局所属华北、华东、东北、西北、中南、西南六个影片经理公司，亦有放映队二十余个。华北、华东、东北等地并已先后派遣放映队赴工厂、农村实验放映，以取得工作经验。该局不久将开办放映训练班，准备人材，以完成今年年底将放映队增加到七百个队的计划。
    进厂下乡放映电影  工人农民热烈欢迎
    根据该局直接派遣的放映队在工厂、农村实验放映的情形，广大工人、农民对电影极为欢迎，所收教育效果很大。放映队先后在天津、石景山、长辛店、丰台等地工厂中放映《光芒万丈》十三场，观众达一万五千余人；而在河北省的徐水、定兴等十县与保定市区放映的三十三场电影（其中八场在农村放映，二十二场在小市镇，三场在小城市。影片有《新中国诞生》、《民主东北第十辑》、《光芒万丈》、北影纪录片第四号等），观众竟达十四万余人。放映队每到一村，附近几里地的住民，倾庄倾镇来看电影。他们挤满了放映场所，甚至爬在附近的高地上、墙上、屋顶上和树上观看。在易县时，有三个农民自发地拿着白面、猪肉来慰劳放映队。电影对农民产生了深刻的影响：他们看过《新中国诞生》之后，大家兴奋地奔走相告：“咱这回可看见毛主席啦！”流露出对人民领袖无限的热爱。看到《民主东北》第十辑选举村政权的镜头时，全场爆发雷鸣似的欢呼。看到了纺纱厂，他们说：“咱们从前怕种棉花卖不出去。这回知道再多种也不够用”。特别使农民感兴趣的是在北影第四号片中的拖拉机，大家谈论着期望着有一天能用上它。
    工人农民提出意见  希望电影工作改进
    放映队在各处放映之后，曾数次召集工人、农民举行座谈会，征询他们的意见。工人、农民几乎一致希望能多多到他们中间去放映。很多工人对《光芒万丈》一片，认为有很大的启示、教育作用，但也提出了不少意见。农民和农村干部则表示喜欢看新闻简报；希望影片内容包括农村活动：如反映农村生产情况，农村的劳动英雄事迹，以及改良农业技术与组织互助、破除迷信与封建思想的残余等内容的片子。农民们要求电影的镜头转换慢一些；故事要有连续性，情节要单纯，最好能原原本本，有始有终地叙述下去。而且他们希望放映时间要加长，因为他们看一次电影很不容易。《光芒万丈》在农村放映时，也极为农民所欢迎。干部们反映：“这部片子帮助农民认识工人阶级有很大作用。”
    在实验放映中，放映队获得了初步的工作经验。如赴工厂、农村之先，应与工厂的工会、行政和农村地方政府等取得密切联系，帮助解决放映中的问题，特别是在农村放映，因观众特别多，因此必须择适当的放映地点与注意维持秩序。放映前，应通过报纸、墙报、屋顶广播等作好宣传工作，并印发通俗说明书，以帮助工人、农民了解剧情。放映之后，要广泛征求意见，及时检查，以改进工作。
    目前，赴农村放映中最困难的是交通问题。放映队下乡必须携带放映机、发电机与修理检查的人员。农村间以大车载运来往，不独延误时间，而且容易损坏机件。
