　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th: Over the past two months, the People's Liberation Army East China Military Region and the Third Field Army have actively cleaned up warehouses and work accounts, and implemented a unified financial management system, basically ending the past phenomena of decentralization, chaos, and waste in financial work.
　　In implementing the unified financial management of the entire army, the Logistics and Finance Department of the Military Region and the Third Field Army first unified the funding and food supply of the entire army, specifically implementing the national unified system stipulated by the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission. In terms of financial expenditures, the budget and final account system was strictly controlled, audit work was strengthened, the number of personnel, horses, and firearms was verified, and funds were allocated according to the actual local prices at the time. The second was to implement a unified system for food supply. Except for troops still performing combat missions, which are still using on-the-spot grain allocation methods due to frequent movements, the general organs and troops stationed have gradually gone to designated grain storage areas to collect grain, in order to achieve planned and rational supply, correcting the previous phenomenon of incompatibility between garrison troops and grain storage areas. The third is to strengthen unified cash management. Since October of last year, the entire army's funds have been uniformly received from the national treasury by the Finance Department, all deposited in the People's Bank, and a payment method of issuing checks for use has been implemented, with checks being issued in installments according to actual needs. In order to further strengthen cash management, the Logistics and Finance Department is discussing with the People's Bank on the method of depositing troops' funds, which will be piloted by units above the regimental level in the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area, and then promoted throughout the army after experience is gained.
　　In the process of clearing accounts, the Logistics and Finance Department further discovered serious chaos and waste in past financial work, as well as phenomena such as "substituting approval for audit" and "reporting after sales" that did not comply with the system. For example, a certain unit spent 240 million yuan without going through budget procedures to repair houses and furniture. When a certain corps repaired an auto repair factory, half of the budgeted funds were spent on repairing the dining hall, floors, and glass, while the main machine room was not repaired. In addition, some units reported less than they received, and some budgeted numbers of people often exceeded the statistical number of actual strength, with the budgeted number of people in the entire army sometimes exceeding the final account number by as many as 120,000. At the same time, many units did not hand over the surplus of grain and funds and some combat seized materials, but kept them as "flexible expenses", forming a situation of independent "small treasuries".
　　After rectification, the above phenomena have begun to be gradually corrected. In April, the budgeted number of people in the entire army only exceeded the statistical number of actual strength by 500, which is an achievement that has never been achieved in the past. The "small treasuries" of various units have been successively cleared and handed over. According to preliminary statistics, a total of more than 33,490,000 catties of grain and more than 555,387,000 yuan in funds remaining from 1949 and three months of 1950 have been submitted.

　　华东军区暨三野部队清理仓库统一财务
    财经工作分散混乱现象基本克服
    【新华社南京二十六日电】人民解放军华东军区暨第三野战军全军两个月来积极清理仓库和工作账目，贯彻实施财务统一管理制度基本上结束了过去财经工作中的分散、混乱和浪费的现象。
    军区暨三野后勤财务部在实施全军财务统一管理中，首先是统一了全军的经费和粮食供给，具体执行了中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会规定的全国统一的制度。在财务开支上严格掌握预决算制度，加强审核工作，核实人员、马匹、枪支的数额，按当时当地实际物价批拨经费。其次为实施粮食供应统筹统支办法。全军除尚在执行作战任务的部队因调动频繁，目前仍采用就地拨粮办法外，一般已驻定的机关部队已逐步做到赴指定存粮地区支粮，以实现有计划的合理的供应，纠正了以往驻军与储粮地区不适应的现象。第三是加强现金统一管理。从去年十月开始，全军经费已由财务部统一向国库领取，全部存入人民银行，实行支拨付款办法，分期按照实际需要开发支票支用。现为进一步加强现金管理，后勤财务部正在与人民银行商讨部队存款办法，先由宁沪杭地区团以上单位试行，取得经验，然后推广全军执行。
    后勤财务部在清理账目中，进一步发现了过去财务工作中的严重的混乱、浪费，以及不守制度的“以批代审”、“先销后报”等现象。如某部不经预算手续擅自开支二亿四千余万元修理房屋家俱。某兵团修理一个汽车修理厂时把预算经费的一半花在修饭堂、地板、玻璃，而主要的机器间却未修好。此外，有的单位多领少报，有的预算人数常超过规定的实力统计人数，全军预算人数最多时曾超过决算人数达十二万人。同时还有不少单位的粮款存余及部分战斗缴获物资不向上缴送，擅自保管作为“机动费用”，形成各自为政的“小金库”现象。
    经过整理以后，以上现象已开始逐步被纠正。四月份全军预算人数仅超过实力统计人数五百人，这是过去从未做到的成绩。各单位的“小金库”已陆续清理上缴。初步统计已呈缴一九四九年和一九五○年三个月结存的粮食共三千三百四十九万余斤，结存经费共人民币五亿五千三百八十七万余元。
