The rapid troops of the East Route People's Liberation Army, who landed on Hainan Island on the night of April 24th at 11 p.m., took advantage of the captured vehicles and, starting from Haikou, sped along the eastern ring road of Qiongya in a swift long-distance pursuit of the fleeing bandits, heading straight for Yulin Port, the last port of the bandit army.

Having advanced more than two hundred *li* to the territory of Lehui County, the rapid troops captured the rearguard of the fleeing bandits. The bandits, who were in the habit of looting, were still catching chickens and hitting dogs in the villages along both sides of the road. When they saw the long line of vehicles arriving, they mistakenly thought it was their last retreat trucks and waved their hands in a daze, shouting, "Officer! Take me with you!" But in the blink of an eye, they were stunned. At the command of the People's Liberation Army, entire squads and platoons of bandits held up surrender flags, took off their hats, stood on the side of the road, and became prisoners.

As the rapid troops advanced to the area north of Longgun City, which belongs to Wan'ning County, they suddenly cut into the middle of the Second Column of the fleeing bandits' main force. Under the fierce attack of the People's Liberation Army, the bandits, terrified, abandoned their weapons and fled in disorder to the mountain roads on both sides of the highway. Backpacks and weapons abandoned by the fleeing bandits were scattered all over the mountains and fields. The pursuing troops did not waste time cleaning up the battlefield and chased all the way to Hele City in the northeast of Wan'ning County. The enemy was fleeing to the coast. The People's Liberation Army immediately got out of the vehicles and gave chase. Groups of remnants of the 32nd and 62nd Armies of the bandit army, which had been defeated, were escorted by local people. Those scattered bandits who were at the end of their rope and starving surrendered to our army one after another.

In the Houtang area north of Wan'ning, two battalions of remnant bandits attempted to hinder our army's advance in order to cover the escape of their main force by boat. The two-way pursuit troops of the People's Liberation Army arrived at the same time and quickly annihilated the enemy. When the two-way pursuit troops of the People's Liberation Army arrived at the Baisha and Wuchang Port coasts in Wan'ning County, the enemy was scrambling to board four enemy ships, preparing to escape. The decks of the ships were packed with people. Five platoons of our army, who arrived at the seaside, organized light and heavy firepower at a distance of two to three hundred meters and fired fiercely at the enemy ships. The bandits on the ships were immediately thrown into chaos, trampled on each other, and fell into the sea one after another. The damaged enemy ships took advantage of the twilight and fled in a panic.

After a week of non-stop pursuit, the rapid troops liberated Sanya Port and Yulin Port, the final targets, on April 30th, successfully ending the Hainan Island Campaign. During the week-long pursuit, residents along the way automatically boiled tea and delivered water to our army, reported enemy situations, and captured defeated scattered bandits, and cleaned up the battlefield. Therefore, the troops were able to drive straight in without any worries. Even when the rapid troops returned victoriously, they still encountered many residents carrying ammunition collected from the battlefield to the local people's government.

　　快速部队急取榆林港
    史耶
    四月二十四日夜十一时登陆海南岛的东路人民解放军的快速部队，乘着缴获的汽车，从海口出发，沿着琼崖东部环岛公路飞速地向逃匪展开长距离追击，直取匪军的最后港口榆林港。
    快速部队前进二百余里到了乐会县境，抓住了南逃溃匪的殿后部队。抢劫成性的匪徒们，还在公路两旁的村子里捕鸡打狗。他们一见长列的汽车到来，还以为是自己的最后撤退的卡车，便昏头昏脑地纷纷摇手招呼：“官长呀！带上我吧！”但一转眼间他们就吓得目瞪口呆。在解放军的喝令下，整班整排的匪军都手持降旗，脱了帽子，站立道旁，作了俘虏。
    快速部队前进到万宁县属龙滚市以北地区，一下子就插进了溃匪主力的二路纵队中间。在解放军的猛烈攻击下，匪徒们落魂丧胆地丢下武器，向公路两侧山道乱窜。满山遍野都是逃匪遗弃的背包和武器。追击部队没有耗费时间去打扫战场，就一口气地追到了万宁县东北的和乐市。敌人正纷纷向海岸逃跑。解放军立即下车跟踪猛追。被追垮的匪军三十二军和六十二军残部，一群群地被当地民众押解前来。那些走头无路饥饿不堪的散匪，纷纷向我军投降。
    在万宁以北的后塘地区，残匪两个营还企图阻滞我军前进，借以掩护其主力部队乘船脱逃。解放军的两路追击部队同时赶到，迅速将敌人歼灭。当两路解放军追击部队赶到万宁县境的百沙和乌场港海岸时，敌人正在抢登四艘敌舰，准备逃跑。舰上黑压压的一片人头。赶到海边的我军五个排，在相距二三百米达处组织轻重火力，向敌舰猛烈射击。舰上匪军顿时混乱一团，互相践踏，纷纷落海。被击伤的敌舰，趁着暮色，仓皇地狼狈逃去。
    快速部队经过一星期的不停追击，就在四月三十日解放了最后的目标三亚港和榆林港，胜利地结束了海南岛战役。在一星期的追击中，沿途各地居民自动给我军烧茶送水，报告敌情，并捕捉被击溃的散匪，打扫战场。因而使部队得以无顾虑地长驱直入。直到快速部队胜利返回时，沿途还遇到许多居民挑着在战地收集起来的弹药，向当地的人民政府送去。
