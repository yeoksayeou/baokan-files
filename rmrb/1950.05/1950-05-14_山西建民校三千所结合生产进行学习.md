　　Shanxi Establishes 3,000 People's Schools, Integrating Learning with Production
    [This newspaper Taiyuan News] According to statistics from 25 counties and one industrial and mining area in Shanxi Province, where winter literacy work has been relatively successful, 3,273 winter schools have been transformed into permanent people's schools, accounting for approximately 32% of the original winter schools in these areas. The transformation of winter schools into people's schools in this province is being carried out based on the demands of the masses. At the end of the winter literacy programs, many people reflected: "If we don't transition to people's schools, we will have to attend winter literacy programs every year, and we will remain illiterate every year." Therefore, the Department of Culture and Education requested that areas with a good foundation in winter literacy work convert at least one-quarter of their winter schools into people's schools; areas with a poorer foundation should convert one-sixth or one-eighth, and the remaining areas could establish youth literacy groups, newspaper reading groups, and correspondence groups to lay the foundation for opening winter literacy programs this year. At the same time, each county is required to carry out the work of three to five experimental people's school villages this year and complete a survey of illiteracy throughout the province as preparation for gradually carrying out the literacy movement in the future. All local people's schools or other learning organizations must closely integrate learning with central tasks, paying particular attention to serving production in order to inspire the masses' enthusiasm for production and improve production technology and scientific health knowledge. In terms of leadership in people's schools, a laissez-faire or coercive style of work is opposed.

　　山西建民校三千所结合生产进行学习
    【本报太原讯】山西省各冬学工作较好的地区，据二十五县、一个工矿区统计，已有三千二百七十三所冬学转为常年民校，约占各该地区原有冬学数的百分之三十二。该省冬学转民校工作是根据群众要求进行的，在冬学结束时，许多群众反映：“不转民校就要年年上冬学，年年不识字”，因此，文教厅要求冬学工作基础较好的地区，至少将四分之一冬学转入民校；较差的地区转六分之一或八分之一，其余地区则可建立青年识字组、读报组、通讯组等学习组织，为今年开办冬学打下基础。同时，要求每县在今年作好三个至五个民校实验村工作，并完成全省文盲调查，作为今后逐步开展识字运动的准备。各地民校或其他学习组织，均必须密切结合中心工作进行学习，特别注意服务于生产，以启发群众的生产积极性，提高生产技术与科学卫生常识。在民校的领导方面，则反对放任自流或强迫命令的工作作风。
