To the Editor:

    Some time ago, we reported to your newspaper that a few comrades from the troops stationed in the Temple of Heaven had caused some damage and borrowed items. Your newspaper sent comrades to our village to investigate and discuss solutions with the unit. After the responsible comrades of the stationed troops learned of this situation, they immediately came to our village to apologize and decided on a method of compensating for damaged farm tools: 15,000 yuan was paid for the damaged hoe of Dong Deshun, 30,000 yuan was paid for the damaged parts of Yu Zhonghai's handcart, 5,000 yuan was paid for the damaged shovel of Li Delin, 3,000 yuan was paid for the damaged axe of Zhao Fengxiang, and more than 70,000 yuan was paid to compensate each household for borrowed items. They also bowed and apologized to everyone. This moved us all to tears! We sincerely thank Chairman Mao. Indeed, who has ever seen such an army in all their lives in Beijing? Let's unite our army and people more closely!

    西四块玉村农民来信对解放军赔偿损失表示满意编辑同志：
    我们不久以前曾将天坛驻军中少数同志有损坏借物等情事报告贵报，承报社同志亲来本村调查，并与该部队商讨解决办法。该地驻军负责同志知道这种情况后，立即前来本村致歉并决定赔偿损坏农具的办法：损坏董德顺镐头一把赔偿一万五千元，损坏玉忠海之手车零件赔偿三万元，损坏李德林铁锹一把赔偿五千，损坏赵凤祥斧头赔偿三千元，赔偿各借物户损失共计七万余元。并向大家鞠躬道歉。这感动得我们大家要流眼泪！我们真心诚意地要感谢毛主席。确实如此，在北京住了一辈的人，谁见过这种军队？让我们军民团结得更紧一些吧！
