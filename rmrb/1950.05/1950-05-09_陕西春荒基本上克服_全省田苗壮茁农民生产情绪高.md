　　[Xian News] According to the Xian Masses Daily, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government held its eleventh administrative meeting on the 22nd of last month, during which they listened to the report by Xie Huaide, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, on the inspection of spring production work throughout the province. Director Xie Huaide said in his report: "This year, the farmers in both the old and new areas have very high enthusiasm for production. Weeding wheat, sowing seeds, providing disaster relief, building water conservancy projects, reclaiming wasteland, plowing land, planting trees, preparing for cotton planting, and women participating in production have all achieved great results. For example, in some parts of the Guanzhong area, wheat was not weeded in previous years, but this year it has been weeded once in most areas, and women have also gone to the fields, which is rare in the past. The Luo Hui Canal has been tested for water release, and the Han Hui and Bao Hui canals will be fully repaired by the end of May and begin to release water. The Shaanxi trade organs have issued loans to enable farmers to buy more than 4,600 head of cattle. According to preliminary statistics, the army and the masses have reclaimed 536,017 mu of wasteland. According to incomplete statistics, 1,359,080 trees have been planted throughout the province (excluding 750,000 trees planted by state-owned forest farms). Rural lending has begun to become active. In Baoji, Qishan, and Bin County alone, a total of about 4,315 shi and 4 dou of grain have been loaned out. Some disaster victims have been sent to the Huanglong Mountain area for land reclamation and production, and some have been resettled locally to participate in other production undertakings, and have generally received relief. Now that the spring rain has just passed, the seedlings are growing sturdily, and the farmers are full of confidence and working hard in production. In addition, prices are stable, the spring drought difficulties throughout the province have been basically resolved, and the disaster is clearly turning around and starting to improve. As long as we are always vigilant and continue to work hard to prevent various disasters, we will definitely be able to achieve a bumper harvest." Regarding the shortcomings in spring production, he pointed out: Some places only pursue numbers without doing practical work, or put production work on an equal footing with other work, some areas only do "pilot projects," which delays the overall situation, and some mutual aid teams are not practical, which makes the masses dissatisfied. Finally, he analyzed: "These are all manifestations of bureaucracy that have not been well integrated with the actual needs of the masses. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry has given many instructions in its leadership, but has not done enough in-depth inspections, which is worth paying attention to in the future."

　　陕西春荒基本上克服
    全省田苗壮茁农民生产情绪高
    【西安讯】据西安群众日报消息：陕西省人民政府上月二十二日举行第十一次行政会议时，听取了农林厅谢怀德厅长关于全省春季生产工作的检查报告。谢怀德厅长在报告中说：“今年不管老区或新区农民的生产情绪均很高。使锄麦、播种、救灾、兴修水利、开荒翻地、植树、准备植棉、妇女参加生产等工作均收到了很多的成效，如关中地区有些地方往年不锄麦，今年绝大部分锄了一遍，妇女也下了地，这是过去历史上少有过的事。洛惠渠已试行放水，汉惠、褒惠等渠五月底即可完全修复，开始放水。陕北贸易机关发放贷款使农民买到耕牛四千六百余头，军队和群众开垦荒地，据初步统计有五十三万六千零一十七亩。全省植树据不完全统计，有一百三十五万九千零八十株（国营林场植树七十五万株在外）。农村借贷开始活跃起来，仅宝鸡、岐山、邠县三地，即共约借贷出粮食四千三百一十五石四斗。灾难民一部送黄龙山区进行垦荒生产，一部就地安置参加其他生产事业，并普遍得到救济。现在春雨刚过，田苗壮茁，农民均在满怀信心，努力生产。加之物价平稳，全省春荒困难已基本解决，灾荒亦已显见回头并开始好转，只要我们时刻警惕，继续努力严防各种灾害，一定可以使农产丰收。”关于春季生产中的缺点，他指出：有些地方只追求数目字，而未做实际工作，或把生产工作与其他工作平列，一些地区只做“试办”，耽误了全局，有些变工队不切实际，反使群众不满。最后他分析说：“这都是没有和群众的实际需要很好地结合起来的官僚主义表现。农林厅在领导上指示固不少，但深入的检查做得还不多，这是值得今后注意的。”
