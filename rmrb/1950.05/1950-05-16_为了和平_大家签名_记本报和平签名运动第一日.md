　　For Peace, Everyone Signs
　　A Record of the People's Daily Peace Signature Campaign's First Day
　　Yesterday morning at seven o'clock, as the sunlight shone upon our newly awakened city, the "Peace Signature Station" of this newspaper on Wangfujing Street was already crowded with people. After seeing the red banner that read, "Comrades who love peace, please come here to sign!" even before they had seen the full text of the long red cloth peace appeal, and even before our tables and pens had been properly arranged, many people were vying to participate in the signing. Our staff had just put down the fresh flowers and the signature book when Wu Changsheng, a worker from the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, was the first to sign his name in the signature book. Then, more than twenty construction workers also signed their names one by one.

　　The number of people on the street gradually increased.

　　Our specially set up peace signature broadcast and the large red cloth peace appeal attracted the attention of many people.

　　Worker Cao Xiushan wrote in the opinion book the working class's will to defend peace: "For the sake of the survival of the people of the world, we workers must use all our strength to defend world peace!"

　　An old man from the countryside, after understanding the meaning of the peace signature campaign, repeatedly said, "Peace is a good thing, of course I have to sign my name."

　　Many People's Liberation Army soldiers signed. In the afternoon, when it was raining, several soldiers even braved the rain to sign. Comrade Guo Yong of the Guard First Company of the Railway Ministry's Public Security Bureau also wrote: "We, the People's Liberation Army, have a firm will and a glorious tradition. We must oppose imperialist aggressive wars and defend our motherland. It is our glorious task to stand with the Soviet people to jointly defend world peace."

　　Young people are very enthusiastic about supporting the world peace movement. Many young people said while signing, "We came specifically to sign." Young woman Liang Lijuan wrote: "Young people should stand at the forefront of defending peace."

　　The elderly, thinking of the happiness of their children and grandchildren, understand the preciousness of peace the most. Many old gentlemen and old ladies used their trembling hands to pick up pens and sign their names in the signature book. An old gentleman named Qiao Zhongwei, sixty-three years old, sent his signed statement, which read: "Strongly condemn the U.S. imperialism for disrupting world peace! Resolutely prohibit the use of atomic weapons!" He also added: "The U.S. plane's bombing of Fuzhou citizens on April 9, which resulted in more than 170 casualties, was particularly inhumane."

　　Many mothers holding or leading their children came to sign. For the sake of their children, they want to oppose wars of aggression!

　　Many people got off their bicycles to sign, and pedicab drivers stopped their vehicles to sign. Vendors put down their burdens to sign. Railway worker representatives from the Northeast and Taiyuan who came to Beijing for meetings, and comrades from the Yumen Oil Mine in Gansu, all enthusiastically participated in the signing.

　　One of the most moving scenes in today's signature campaign was the enthusiastic participation of foreigners of different nationalities. Several Soviet comrades, after passing the signature station and seeing the clear Russian slogans, enthusiastically and automatically signed their names. Four Czech expatriates and three Romanian expatriates signed the signature book in their native languages to support lasting peace. An American woman wrote in English after her signature: "Peace is what the whole world needs most." A Japanese expatriate living in Dongjiaominxiang, although he did not pass by the signature station, enthusiastically signed his own name on the appeal and sent it in an envelope.

　　Today, among the fifty foreigners who participated in the signing were Soviet friends, Ukrainian engineers, Romanian shoemakers, an American nurse, and a Greek stenographer. This shows that under the banner of peace, in the ranks of striving for peace, there is no distinction of nationality, ethnicity, religious belief, or political opinion.

　　Until 7:30 in the afternoon, when it was getting dark, there were still many people coming to sign.

　　为了和平  大家签名
　　记本报和平签名运动第一日   
    昨天早晨七点钟，当阳光照上了我们初醒的城市的时候，王府井大街本报“和平签名处”前就拥满了人，他们在看到“爱好和平的同志们，请到这里来签名！”的红色标语以后，虽然还没有看到长条红布的和平呼吁书的全文，虽然我们的桌子、笔，还没有摆整齐，便有许多人争先要参加签名。我们的工作同志刚刚放好了鲜花和签名簿，北京电信局工人吴长盛，在签名簿上第一个签了名。接着二十几个建筑工人也一一地签上了自己的名字。
    街道上的人们，逐渐增多了。
    我们特设的和平签名广播、大幅的红布的和平呼吁书引起了许多人的注意。
    工人曹秀山在意见簿上写出工人阶级保卫和平的意志：“为了全世界人民的生存，我们工人要拿出全部力量保卫世界和平！”
    一位从乡下来的老乡，当他明白和平签名运动的意义后，连说：“和平是好事，当然要签个名。”
    人民解放军战士签名的很多。在下午下雨的时候，有几位战士还冒着雨来签名。铁道部公安局警卫一连的郭永同志并写下：“我们人民解放军，有坚决的意志，光荣的传统，我们要反对帝国主义侵略战争，保卫我们的祖国。我们和苏联人民站在一道共同保卫世界和平，是我们光荣的任务。”
    青年人对拥护世界和平运动是很热心的，许多青年一边签名一边说：“我们是特地来签名的。”女青年梁丽娟写道：“青年人应该站在保卫和平的前列。”
    老年人想到他们的儿孙的幸福，最懂得和平的可贵，许多老先生、老太太们用他们颤抖的手，拿起笔在签名簿上签上名。一位六十三岁的乔众维老先生寄来他的签名书，上面写着：“痛斥美帝扰乱世界和平！坚决禁止使用原子武器！”，还附言：“四月九日美机轰炸福州市民，死伤一百七十余人尤属不人道行为。”
    不少手里抱着或者牵着孩子的母亲们来签名，为了孩子，她们要反对侵略战争！
    许多人从自行车上下来签了名，三轮车夫们停下车子来签名。小贩们放下挑子签了名。来北京开会的东北和太原的铁路工人代表，来自甘肃玉门油矿的同志，都热烈地参加了签名。
    今天签名运动中最动人的情景之一，是不同国籍的外侨的踊跃参加签名。好几位苏联同志在经过签名处的时候，看到了鲜明的俄文标语后，就热烈地自动地签上了他们的姓名。四位捷克侨民与三位罗马尼亚侨民为了拥护持久和平，在签名簿上用本国文字签名。有一位美国籍妇女，用英文在她的签名后面写上了：“和平是全世界所最需要的”一句话。一位住在东交民巷的日侨，他虽然没有经过签名处，可是他却热心地在呼吁书后签上了他自己的名字装在信封里寄了来。
    今天参加签名的五十位外侨中有苏联朋友，有乌克兰的工程师，有罗马尼亚籍的制鞋匠，有美国籍的女护士，也有希腊籍的速记员，这说明了在和平的旗帜下，在争取和平的队伍中，是没有国籍、民族、宗教信仰和政治见解的分别的。
    直到下午七点半钟，天色将黑的时候，还有不少人陆续来签名。
