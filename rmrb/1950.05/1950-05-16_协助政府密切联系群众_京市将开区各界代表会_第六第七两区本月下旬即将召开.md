[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal District People's Representatives Conferences, decided upon by the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference of All Circles, will be piloted in several districts first. The Municipal Consultative Committee and the Municipal People's Government Committee were authorized to formulate organizational rules for the District People's Representatives Conferences. These rules have been formulated, submitted, and approved by the Government Administration Council. Now, the Municipal People's Government has decided that the Sixth District (formerly the Eighth and Ninth Districts) and the Seventh District (formerly the Tenth District) will convene their respective District People's Representatives Conferences in late May to gather experience and extend the practice to the entire city. The two districts are currently establishing preparatory committees to be responsible for preparations such as electing representatives.

	In cities like Beijing, convening District People's Representatives Conferences is very necessary. It can help the People's Government to connect with the masses more broadly and closely, gather mass opinions, and realize the People's Government's various work plans. It facilitates the people's management of political power and further promotes criticism and self-criticism. It can also discuss and resolve issues related to public welfare, public health, municipal construction, and consolidating public security within the district.

	The upcoming Sixth and Seventh District People's Representatives Conferences will accept the opinions of the people of the districts and prepare to resolve three issues: First, discuss and decide on some necessary public welfare and public health construction projects, with the government and citizens working together to repair streets with concentrated businesses or frequent pedestrian traffic; consult on how to systematically repair houses in need of repair within the districts; the People's Government, under necessary and possible conditions, will add some public toilets, sewage pools, water stations, and garbage stations beyond the original municipal plan; and mobilize the masses to establish sanitary regulations to protect public health facilities and prevent damage. Second, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and examine the behavior of cadres who violate policies and their work styles that are detached from the masses. Third, mobilize the masses to assist the Public Security Bureau in further consolidating revolutionary order.

　　协助政府密切联系群众
　　京市将开区各界代表会     
    第六第七两区本月下旬即将召开
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市区各界人民代表会议，已经北京市第二届第二次各界人民代表会议决定召开，先在几个市区进行试办，并授权市协商委员会和市人民政府委员会负责制定区各界人民代表会议组织通则，现已制定并呈报政务院批准，现经市人民政府决定第六（原第八、第九两区）、第七（原第十区）两区于本月下旬即召开各该区的各界人民代表会议，以便吸取经验，推广到全市。现该两区正在建立筹备委员会，负责进行推选代表等准备工作。
    像北京市这样的城市里，召开区各界人民代表会议是十分必要的。它可以帮助人民政府更广泛、更密切地联系群众，集中群众意见，实现人民政府各项工作计划；它便于人民管理政权，并进一步开展批评与自我批评，它又可以讨论与解决有关本区的公共福利、公共卫生、市政建设及巩固治安等问题。
    最近即将召开的第六、第七两个区的各界人民代表会议，接受区人民意见，准备解决三个问题：第一，讨论与决定一些必要进行的公共福利、公共卫生的建设工作，并由政府和市民协力整修商业集中或行人频繁的街道；协商如何有计划地修缮各该区内待修的房屋，由人民政府在必要与可能的条件下，在原定市政计划之外再增建一些公共厕所、秽水池、自来水站及垃圾站等等，并发动群众订立卫生公约，保护公共卫生设备，防止破坏。第二，开展批评与自我批评，检查干部违犯政策的行为和脱离群众的作风。第三，发动群众协助公安局进一步巩固革命秩序。
