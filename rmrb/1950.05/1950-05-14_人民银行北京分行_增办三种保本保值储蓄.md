　　People's Bank of China Beijing Branch
　　Adds Three Types of Principal-Protected and Value-Preserving Savings Accounts
    [Kyoto City News Agency] Since the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China launched principal-protected and value-preserving fixed-term savings last month, depositors have been extremely enthusiastic. However, the original method was limited to "lump-sum deposit and lump-sum withdrawal." To meet the needs of all sectors, three types of accounts, namely "zero deposit and lump-sum withdrawal," "lump-sum deposit and installment withdrawal," and "deposit principal and pay interest," will be added starting from the 10th of this month. In addition, a seven-day deposit will be added to "lump-sum deposit and lump-sum withdrawal," but it is limited to organized employees of public and private enterprises, staff of government agencies, teachers, students of schools, and mass organizations. There have also been changes in the method of withdrawal upon maturity: regardless of price increases or decreases upon maturity of various deposits, they will not be affected. They can be withdrawn by calculating either in real terms or in currency. However, the principal or interest payable for each payment of "lump-sum deposit and installment withdrawal" and "deposit principal and pay interest" will be temporarily paid in real terms, and any actual principal and interest payable will be compensated for upon the final payment at maturity. For early withdrawals, those who have deposited for half a month can have their principal and value preserved. For "lump-sum deposit and lump-sum withdrawal," interest is calculated at 60% of the actual monthly interest rate for those who have deposited for half a month; for the three types of accounts, "zero deposit and lump-sum withdrawal," "lump-sum deposit and installment withdrawal," and "deposit principal and pay interest," interest is calculated at the half-month interest rate of "lump-sum deposit and lump-sum withdrawal" for those who have deposited for half a month but less than three months, and at 60% of the actual monthly interest rate for those who have deposited for more than three months.

　　人民银行北京分行
　　增办三种保本保值储蓄
    【京市新闻处讯】中国人民银行北京分行自上月举办保本保值定期储蓄后，存款者极为踊跃。惟原办法仅限于“整存整付”一种，兹为适应各界需要，自本月十日起增办“零存整付”、“整存零付”、“存本付息”三种；并在“整存整付”内，增办七天期存款，但对象以有组织之公私营企业职工、机关公务员、学校教职员学生及群众团体为限，关于到期支取办法亦有改变：各种存款到期，无论牌价涨落，不受影响，提取时按折实或货币计算均可，但“整存零付”及“存本付息”每次应付之本金或利息，均暂按折实付给，俟到期最后一次付款时，再根据实际应付本息找补之。提前支取，存满半个月者，即可保本保值。“整存整付”存满半个月者，利息按实存月数利率六折计算；“零存整付”、“整存零付”、“存本付息”三种，存满半月，但不足三个月者，利息按“整存整付”半月利率计算，满三个月以上者，亦按实存月数利率六折计算。
