　　Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: Since the Central People's Broadcasting Station added social science lectures on "Social Development History" and "Political Economics" on April 10th, incomplete statistics show that 206 units and some individual listeners in various regions have established initial contact with the Central People's Broadcasting Station. The distribution of these units is as follows: 154 in North China (including 73 in Beijing), 22 in East China, 15 in Northeast China, 7 in Central and Southern China, 6 in Northwest China, and 2 in Southwest China. They are distributed in 23 provinces in North China, Northeast China, and Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, Fujian, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and six cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Shenyang. Most of the listeners are cadres from government agencies, CCP Party committees, and PLA troops, and some are students, workers, and citizens. The number has not yet been counted. It is known that there are 893 people in Zhangjiakou, more than 2,000 people in Tonghua, and more than 1,000 people in Yingkou. These are all units that have contacted the Central People's Broadcasting Station. Many listening units study very seriously. Everyone believes that social science lectures on the radio not only solve the difficulties of finding teachers and lacking teaching materials in many places, but also play a role in promoting and organizing learning, and greatly help cadres in various places to study.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, May 26th: According to the requirements of most regional social science lecture listening groups, the Central People's Broadcasting Station has decided to delay the broadcasting progress of the two lectures on Social Development History and Political Economics starting next week. Starting next week, both lectures will be changed to one topic per week, so that listeners can preview before listening and review or discuss after listening. At the same time, in order to facilitate listeners in various regions with different work and rest times, the station has decided to increase the number of rebroadcasts starting next week. The same topic will be rebroadcast six times a week; three times by the lecturer, and three times by the announcer rebroadcasting the original manuscript. The broadcasting time of the social science lectures has also been slightly changed. Except for the first time from 6:00 to 7:00 in the morning and the third time from 19:00 to 20:00 in the evening, which remain unchanged, the second time has been changed from 8:00 to 9:00 in the morning to 7:30 to 8:30.

　　中央人民广播电台社会科学讲座
    与二百余收听单位建立联系
    下周起决延缓播讲进度增加重播次数
    【新华社二十五日讯】中央人民广播电台从四月十日增设社会科学讲座播讲“社会发展史”与“政治经济学”以来，到今天为止，据不完全统计，各地听众和中央人民广播电台建立初步联系的已有二百零六单位及一部分个别收听者。这些单位分布的地区：华北一百五十四（内北京市七十三），华东二十二，东北十五，中南七，西北六，西南二。分布在华北、东北各省及苏、鲁、皖、闽、浙、豫、湘、鄂、赣、桂陕、甘等共二十三省及京、津、沪、宁、汉、沈六市。收听者大部分是政府机关、中共党委机关及解放军部队干部，也有一部分是学生、职工和市民。人数尚未统计，已知者如张家口市有八百九十三人，通化市有二千多人，营口市有一千多人，这些都是作为一个单位和中央人民广播电台联系的。有不少收听单位学习很认真。大家都认为社会科学讲座广播，不仅解决了许多地方找不到教员和缺少教材的困难，而且对于学习起了推动和组织的作用，对各地干部学习帮助很大。
    【新华社二十六日讯】中央人民广播电台根据多数地区社会科学讲座收听小组的要求，决定从下星期起，延缓社会发展史与政治经济学两讲座的播讲进度。该两讲座从下星期起均改为每星期各讲一个题目，以便听众能在听讲前预习，在听讲后复习或讨论。同时，为了便利各地作息时间不同的听众收听，该台并决定从下星期起，增加重播次数。同一题目在一星期内重复播讲六次；三次由主讲人播讲，三次由播音员按原稿重播。社会科学讲座广播时间也略有变动，除第一次在早晨六点到七点，第三次在晚间十九点到二十点不变外，第二次由早晨八点到九点改为七点半到八点半。
