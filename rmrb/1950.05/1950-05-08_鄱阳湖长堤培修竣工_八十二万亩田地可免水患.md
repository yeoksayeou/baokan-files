　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 29th. The Poyang Lake embankment in Poyang, Yugan, and Wannian counties has been completely reinforced before spring plowing and sowing, protecting 820,000 mu of farmland, which was flooded last summer, from flooding this year, and safeguarding the livelihoods of 360,000 farmers.
    In order to restore agricultural production in the disaster area and organize disaster victims to help themselves through production, the local people's government allocated 5 million catties of rice last December and implemented a work-for-relief program, mobilizing the masses to repair the dikes. An average of over 125,000 laborers worked on the dikes daily. Through three months of effort, the entire workforce not only completed the massive project but also provided living resources for over 300,000 disaster victims.
    During the dike repair, the people's governments of various counties, based on the principle of "dividing dikes by person and calculating accounts by field," adjusted the past unreasonable burden-sharing for dike repair. At the same time, they used methods such as recording work points, competing for red flags, and organizing dike repair shock brigades to launch labor competitions, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of the laborers for dike repair. In addition, the planned organization and use of labor power enabled the rapid completion of the dike repair project.
    After the dikes were repaired, the local farmers have been fully engaged in spring plowing, and early rice has been completely sown. The entire special district has also reclaimed 50,000 mu of wasteland.

　　鄱阳湖长堤培修竣工
    八十二万亩田地可免水患
    【新华社南昌二十九日电】鄱阳湖沿岸鄱阳、余干、万年三县已将一千八百里的长堤于春耕播种前全部培修竣工，使去年夏季被淹的八十二万亩田地免除了今年的水患，三十六万农民的生活也得到了保障。
    当地人民政府为恢复受灾区的农业生产和组织灾民生产自救，于去年十二月拨发大米五百万斤，实行以工代赈，发动群众修堤。上堤民工每日平均十二万五千余人。全体民工经过三个月的努力，不仅完成巨大工程，且使三十多万灾民获得生活资料。
    在修堤中，各县人民政府根据“按人分圩、照田算账”的原则，调整过去修堤负担不合理的现象；同时，并用记工、抢红旗、组织修堤突击队等方法，展开劳动竞赛，民工修堤情绪大大提高；此外，有计划地组织和使用劳动力，因此使修堤工程迅速完成。
    圩堤修好后，该地农民已全力投入春耕，早稻已全部下种，全专区并垦荒五万亩。
