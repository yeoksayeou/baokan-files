During the meeting, proposals and opinions will continue to be collected. According to the opinions already put forward by people from all walks of life in the district, this conference will focus on solving residents' welfare problems. Secondly, it will inspect the work style and discipline of cadres. After all proposals are discussed by the conference, they will be submitted to the District People's Government (District Office) for implementation or reference according to their importance, urgency, and feasibility.
