　　(Shenyang News) The Northeast Industrial Department issued a "Notice on Three Issues to be Noted in Implementing the Production Responsibility System Decision" on the 5th of this month. The notice pointed out: In the past two months, there are still three issues in the implementation of the production responsibility system decision in various factories and mines in Northeast China that deserve the attention of leaders at all levels. First, many factories and mines have not sufficiently mobilized the masses. Some leading cadres in factories and mines still have the idea of being afraid of mobilizing workers and technicians. They are afraid that the workers will raise many difficulties that they cannot solve. Some leading cadres in factories and mines mistakenly believe that implementing the responsibility system is a matter for the leadership and there is no need to mobilize the masses. The publicity and education work for the responsibility system is also not in-depth. Therefore, some technicians in factories and mines do not know what their responsibilities are, and many squad leaders, team leaders, and workers are not clear about what they are responsible for when something happens. Second, in order to implement the production responsibility system, factories and mines should establish the following four types of systems in a step-by-step manner based on specific circumstances:

　　1. Responsibility system for guaranteeing the completion and exceeding of production and construction plans. The tasks of each person, each day, and each ten-day period should be stipulated according to production and work quotas. The production and work tasks should be handed over to everyone (all employees and technicians) for democratic discussion. Therefore, there must be regulations on the meeting system. In order to check the implementation of tasks, it is necessary to establish a level-by-level reporting and correct statistical system. Exceeding the state plan is the responsibility of all technicians, workers, and cadres.

　　2. Safety responsibility system to ensure safe production and eliminate responsibility accidents. Any factory or mine should clearly study: where and when accidents may occur; and then stipulate how to prevent them, who is responsible, what responsibilities are, explain it clearly, and regularly check and educate. Some systems should be established, such as a regular inspection and maintenance system for mechanical equipment, a strict shift handover system, an examination system for various operating procedures, and a reporting system for safety conditions.

　　3. Responsibility system for guaranteeing product quality. Specifically stipulate the quality specifications of the products, and designate special organizations and personnel responsible for inspecting the quality. Where the quality is unqualified, under normal circumstances, it should be immediately reported to the Ministry of Industry for approval to stop or reduce production. After testing and solving the quality problem, mass production can begin.

　　4. Responsibility system for raw material supply. In order to change the phenomenon of waiting for materials to start work that still exists in some places, leaders should go deep into the front line to understand the situation and supply raw materials in a planned and far-sighted manner.

　　Third, various systems and procedures should be gradually unified. Various factories and mines have put forward some systems and procedures in establishing the responsibility system. However, the operating procedures for the same machine vary greatly between Factory A and Factory B, and the systems are also inconsistent. It is required that the bureau (company) level take the lead in carrying out this work, so that it can be gradually unified and improved, so that personnel and organizations with the same positions have the same task regulations, and the same equipment has the same operating technical procedures. In particular, it is very necessary for factories and mines that have not yet established various procedures and systems to first establish various systems from the bottom up.

### 东北工业部通报各厂矿  发动广大职工贯彻责任制度

　　东北工业部通报各厂矿
    发动广大职工  贯彻责任制度
    【沈阳讯】东北工业部于本月五日发出“贯彻生产责任制决定中应注意的三个问题”的通报。该通报指出：两个月来，东北各厂矿在贯彻生产责任制决定中，还有三个值得各级领导干部重视的问题。第一、许多厂矿发动群众不够。有些厂矿的领导干部还存在着怕发动职工及技术人员的思想。他们怕职工提出很多困难，自己无法解决。有些厂矿的领导干部则错误的认为：贯彻责任制是领导上的事，不必发动群众。对于责任制的宣传教育工作，又是不深入的。因此，有些厂矿的技术人员不知道自己的责任是什么，许多班长、组长、工人还不清楚发生了什么事情要自己负责任。第二、为贯彻生产责任制，各厂矿应结合具体情况，有步骤地建立下面四种制度：
    一、保证生产建设计划完成和超过的责任制。要根据生产、工作定额，规定每人、每日、每旬的任务。并把生产和工作的任务，交给每个人（全体职工和技术人员）民主讨论。因此就要有会议制度的规定，为了检查任务执行的情况，又必须建立逐级汇报和正确的统计制度。国家计划只能超过，这是一切技术人员、职工和干部的责任。
    二、保证安全生产，消灭责任事故的安全责任制。任何一个厂、矿都应该清楚的研究：什么地方、什么时候可能发生事故；从而规定如何预防，何人负责，负什么责，交代得清清楚楚，并经常检查，教育。应该建立一些制度，如机械设备的定期检修制度、严格的交接班制度、各种规程的考试制度、安全情况的报告制度等。
    三、保证产品质量的责任制。具体规定产品的质量规格，指定负责检查质量的专门机构和人员。凡质量不合格者，在一般的情况下，应立即报告工业部批准停作、或少作。经过试验，质量问题解决后，再开始大量生产。
    四、原材料供应的责任制。为了改变目前有些地方还存在的等工待料的现象，领导人员应该深入现场，了解情况，有计划、有预见的供应原材料。
    第三、应该逐渐统一各种制度和规程。各厂矿在建立责任制中，都提出了一些制度和规程。但是同样的机器，在甲厂和在乙厂的操作规程差异甚大，制度也不一致。要求局（公司）一级有领导的来进行这一工作，使之逐渐统一和完善，使同样职务的人员和组织有同样任务的规定，同样设备要有同样操作技术规程。特别是还没有建立各种规程和制度的厂、矿，首先初步的从下而上的建立各种制度，是很必要的。
