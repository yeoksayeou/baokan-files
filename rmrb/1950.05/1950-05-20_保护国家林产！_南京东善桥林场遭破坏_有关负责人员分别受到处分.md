Protect National Forest Resources!
　　Nanjing Dongshanqiao Forest Farm Suffers Damage
　　Relevant Responsible Personnel Punished
[Our Newspaper] Reporter Bai Sheng reports: After the Nanjing Dongshanqiao Forest Farm was taken over in May of last year, due to the leadership organs and local governments' disregard for agricultural and forestry work, and failure to protect the forest farm, seven large-scale destructive incidents occurred in succession, resulting in the loss of over 220,000 trees, as well as casualties. After this incident occurred, the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government, together with the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation and the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy of the East China Military and Political Committee, sent personnel to investigate. The State Council of the Central People's Government has now approved the handling measures proposed by the Central People's Supervision Committee, and the responsible personnel for the incident have been punished accordingly.

The damage to the forest farm began on May 26th of last year and was effectively stopped on July 31st. The most serious incident was the large-scale felling by over a thousand people between July 21st and 30th. The puppet Baojia heads Chen Jilin, Gao Jiuhong, and Yang Dexing successively incited and threatened the masses to damage the forest farm, resulting in a conflict with the forest police, in which one person from the masses died, five were injured, and one forest police officer was injured. The cause of the incident was that the Economic Department of the Nanjing Military Control Commission and the Construction Bureau of the Municipal People's Government underestimated agricultural and forestry work in their guiding ideology, were extremely slow in arranging agricultural and forestry takeover, and equipped few and weak cadres. Furthermore, after receiving reports of the forest farm being damaged, they did not pay attention to or handle it in a timely manner. The military representative responsible for agricultural and forestry takeover committed serious bureaucratic errors, turning a blind eye to the serious loss of state property. The forest farm made several requests and reports, but the matter was delayed and unresolved, and they were not responsible for handling the aftermath of the damage. At the same time, the Jiangning County People's Government, where the forest farm was located, adopted an "it's none of our business" attitude towards the forest farm, and the education of the masses was insufficient, which was also one of the reasons for the losses suffered this time.

The State Council of the Central People's Government has now approved the four handling measures proposed by the People's Supervision Committee for this incident as follows:

A. Regarding the punishment of relevant personnel: (1) Wan Li, Director of the Economic Department of the Nanjing Military Control Commission, Liu Yaqing, Deputy Director, and Lin Zheng, Deputy Director of the Construction Bureau of the Nanjing Municipal People's Government, shall each receive a minor demerit. (2) Military Representative Yao Erjue shall be given a major demerit. Pu Jiwu, the succeeding military representative, as the main person responsible for the incident, shall be dismissed from his post and demoted, and ordered to thoroughly reflect. (3) Jiangning County Magistrate Song Bo shall be given a minor demerit. (4) Geng Bojie (currently a teaching assistant in the Department of Botany at Nanjing University), who also served as the forest farm director, shall be given a major demerit.

B. The East China Military and Political Committee shall instruct the Jiangning County People's Government to severely punish Chen Jilin and others, the ringleaders who incited the masses to damage the forest farm; and to comfort the dead and injured masses and their families, and investigate and deal with the perpetrators.

C. The general masses who participated in felling trees should be given thorough explanations and education, forestry protection work should be strengthened, and the felled timber that has been collected should be handed over to the Nanjing Office of the East China Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy for disposal. Collection of uncollected timber should be stopped.

D. Employees of the forest farm who actively reported the situation and contributed to forest protection should be reviewed by the Nanjing Office of the East China Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy and rewarded accordingly.

The Nanjing Dongshanqiao Forest Farm is located in the third and fourth districts of Jiangning County, fifty li from Nanjing. It has been established for more than twenty years, with an area of over 8,000 mu, of which 7,600 mu is suitable for afforestation. There are approximately 1.2 million pine trees of various types, of which approximately 300,000 are over ten years old, in addition to many miscellaneous trees. In early May of last year, the farm was taken over by the Economic Department of the Nanjing Military Control Commission, with Yao Erjue as the military representative in charge; after June, it was transferred to the Nanjing Construction Bureau, with Pu Jiwu responsible for leadership; in late September, it was transferred to the management of the East China Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy.

　　保护国家林产！
　  南京东善桥林场遭破坏
　　有关负责人员分别受到处分
    【本报讯】记者柏生报道：南京东善桥林场，在去年五月接管后，因领导机关与地方政府轻视农林工作，不注意保护林场，连续发生七次大规模的破坏事件，损失树木二十二万余株，并造成伤亡事故。此项事件发生后，经中央人民政府人民监察委员会会同林垦部与华东军政委员会农林水利部派员前往查究。现中央人民政府政务院已同意中央人民监察委员会所提出的处理办法，对该事件的负责人员分别予以处分。
    该林场遭受破坏始于去年五月二十六日至七月三十一日始被有效制止。其中最严重的一次是七月二十一日至三十日间的千余人的大砍伐。伪保甲长陈吉林、高九宏、杨德兴等先后煽动、威胁群众来破坏林场，与该场林警发生冲突，群众死一人，伤五人，林警一人受伤。事件发生的原因，是由于南京军管会经济部及市人民政府建设局在领导思想上轻视农林工作，对农林接管布置极为迟缓，且配备干部少而弱，并于接得该林场被破坏的报告后，亦不注意和及时处理。负责农林接管之军代表，更犯严重的官僚主义错误，对国家财富遭受严重损失，熟视无睹，林场数次请示、报告，仍拖延不决，对破坏后的善后工作，亦不负责处理。同时，林场所在地的江宁县人民政府对林场抱着“事不关己”的态度，对群众教育不够，也是此次遭受损失的原因之一。
    现中央人民政府政务院已同意人民监察委员会对该事件的四项处理办法如下：
    甲、关于有关人员的处分：（一）南京军管会经济部长万里、副部长刘雅清，南京市人民政府建设局副局长林征，各记小过一次。（二）军代表姚尔觉，予以记大过一次处分。继任军代表蒲吉五为事件的主要负责人，予以撤职降级处分，并令其彻底反省。（三）江宁县长宋波予以记小过一次处分。（四）兼场长耿伯介（现任南京大学植物系助教）予以记大过一次处分。
    乙、由华东军政委员会转饬江宁县人民政府，严办鼓动群众破坏林场的首要分子陈吉林等；并抚慰死伤群众及其家属，查办肇事的凶手。
    丙、对参加砍伐树木之一般群众，应予深刻解释教育，加强护林工作，并将被砍林木，已收集者交华东农林水利部驻南京办事处处理，未收集者停止收集。
    丁、对于林场积极反映情况，与护林有功的员工，应由华东农林水利部驻南京办事处审查后，予以奖励。
    按南京东善桥林场在江宁县第三区和第四区境内，距南京五十里，已成立二十余年，有场地八千余亩，宜植林地七千六百亩。各类松树约有一百二十万株，其中十年以上的约三十万株，此外杂树尚多。去年五月初该场由南京军管会经济部派姚尔觉为军代表主持接管；六月以后移交南京建设局，由该局派蒲吉五负责领导；九月下旬已移交华东农林水利部管理。
