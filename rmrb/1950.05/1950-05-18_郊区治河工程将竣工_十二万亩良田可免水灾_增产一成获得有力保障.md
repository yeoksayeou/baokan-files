　　Suburban River Management Project Nears Completion
　  120,000 Mu of Farmland Spared from Flooding, Ensuring a Ten Percent Increase in Production
    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Pei Lan reports: The river management project in the suburbs of Beijing is actively underway. The excavation of drainage ditches has been fully completed, and the dredging of rivers and the opening of canals are also nearing completion. Once this project is completed, it will not only prevent 120,000 mu of farmland from flooding but also transform 19,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. This is a major event for the suburbs this year, providing a strong guarantee for a ten percent increase in production.
    The Beijing suburbs are crisscrossed by rivers. More than ten rivers, large and small, including the Yongding River, Feng River, Ba River, Liangshui River, Qing River, Baiqiao River (Han River), North and South Han Rivers, Jin River, North and South Chang Rivers, Jingou River, and Long River, are distributed in the 13th, 14th, 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th districts of the Beijing suburbs. During the long period of rule by the enemy and puppet reactionaries, these rivers were in disrepair for many years, the river channels were silted up, and the dikes were damaged. In the event of mountain floods or excessive rainfall, severe flooding would inevitably occur. After the liberation of Beijing, the People's Government organized the masses to dredge the North Han River. The North Han River did not experience flooding last year. The remaining rivers had not been repaired, and last year happened to be a year of heavy rainfall, resulting in severe flooding. Thirty percent of the suburban cultivated land area (approximately 320,000 mu) was flooded, and the peasants suffered great losses and hardships.
    After the flooding last autumn, the Suburban Committee immediately called on all districts to formulate plans for dredging rivers and digging ditches. At the beginning of this year, based on the plans of various districts, the Suburban Committee formulated an overall river management plan for the suburbs and started construction in January. Now, the drainage ditch dredging project has been fully completed. A total of 123,250 meters have been dredged, and 374,043 cubic meters of earth have been excavated. The dredging of rivers and the opening of canals are nearing completion. The entire project is being carried out in a way that combines disaster relief with not delaying agricultural work, using work as a form of relief. In the first phase of the project alone, 509,814 jin of relief rice have been distributed, which, based on 60 jin of millet per person per month, can solve the living problems of 2,832 people for three months. With the masses having a base to fall back on, they can focus on spring plowing while also avoiding the threat of flooding.
    Before the start of the project, the Suburban Committee conducted a detailed survey with the guidance and assistance of the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture. Due to a lack of technical personnel, assistant teachers and students from Peking University and Tsinghua University were hired to participate. At the same time, district and village cadres and experienced people were recruited to participate in the surveying. Before the start of construction, each district convened a meeting of cadres from villages along the river, clearly pointing out that digging the river was an important task to ensure production and combine disaster relief. And with the district as the unit, a river digging headquarters was organized to control and lead the entire project, and each village voluntarily formed river digging teams, detachments, and groups.
    The peasants along the river, who have turned over a new leaf, deeply realize that the government's leadership in digging the river is to help them protect the fruits of their labor, and their work enthusiasm is very high. Although the water was cold and the wind was strong when digging the river, and some of the canal soil was still frozen, everyone persisted in their work. Women and old men who participated in digging the river were as active as the strong young men. District and village cadres and party and league members played an active leading role. Peasants from Heita Village and Mentou Village in the 16th district who participated in digging the river said: "Let alone earning millet, even if we don't earn millet, we have to do a good job. This is doing work for ourselves." Xiao Shi'an's old mother from Beigangzi Village in the 13th district automatically delivered water to the river digging workers.
    In the process of digging the river, the masses created many scientific methods. Cadres from Nanxiaojie and Dahongmen villages in the 14th district collectively studied the technology, dug out a sample, and let the masses learn. They put up middle stakes, bottom stakes, and top stakes in the river ditch as standards to avoid the problem of uneven width. The masses in Juzi Fang Village in the 13th district used sorghum stalks to make a model according to the standard cross-section, and dug the river according to the model. Dahuangzhuang and Huangshangmudian villages dug a standard sample section before the start of construction, and everyone learned from it. In this way, work efficiency was greatly improved. Nanxiaojie and Nanyuan Town therefore completed their tasks early and were awarded a "Glory Flag" by the district people's government.
    The work of dredging rivers in the suburbs of Beijing has been warmly supported by the broad masses, who all say that this is a great benevolent policy. Wang Liang, a poor peasant in Yudi Village, said: "My two mu of land that I was allocated will not be flooded in the future." Liu Dequan of Donghuqu Village said: "Only when the Communist Party comes can we dig the river. The Kuomintang didn't care about this!"
    The shortcomings of the river management project are: some district and village cadres lack a mass perspective, lack planning, and spend a lot of time in meetings, organization, grain distribution, and model selection, wasting the peasants' production time; the administrative command style of work also exists seriously.

### 郊区治河工程将竣工  十二万亩良田可免水灾  增产一成获得有力保障

　　郊区治河工程将竣工
　  十二万亩良田可免水灾 　 增产一成获得有力保障
    【本报讯】记者培蓝报道：京郊治河工程，正在积极进行中。挖掘排水沟的工程已全部完工，疏浚河道及开凿水渠的工程也将告结束。此项工程全部完成后，不仅可使十二万亩良田免遭水灾，且可变一万九千亩旱地为水田。这是今年郊区的一件大事，对郊区今年增产一成，是一个有力的保障。
    北京郊区河流纵横。永定河、风河、坝河、凉水河、清河、白桥河（旱河）、南北旱河、金河、南北长河、金沟河、龙河等大小河流十余条，分布于京郊十三、十四、十六、十七、十八、十九等区。在敌伪反动派长期统治期间，这些河流年久失修，河道淤塞，堤坝破坏。如遇山洪或过多雨量，势将造成严重水灾。北京解放后，人民政府曾经组织群众疏浚了北旱河。去年北旱河就没有发生水灾。其余河道未及修理，适逢去年多雨，结果发生了严重的水灾。郊区耕地面积百分之三十（约三十二万亩）被淹，农民遭受很大损失和困难。
    去秋水灾过后，郊委会即号召各区制定疏河挖沟计划。今年年初，郊委会根据各区计划，拟定了整个郊区的治河计划，于一月开始动工。现在疏浚排水沟工程已全部完成。共计疏浚一二三、二五○公尺，挖出土方三七四、○四三立方公尺。疏浚河道及开凿水渠工程已近结束。全部工程是在结合救灾，不误农时的原则下，用以工代赈的方式进行的。仅前段工程已发出代赈米五○九、八一四斤，按每人每月吃六十斤小米计算，可解决二千八百三十二人三个月的生活问题。群众有了垫本，可以安心春耕，一面也免除了水患。
    工程开始之前，郊委会在中央农业部水利局的指导与帮助下，进行了详细的勘察。由于技术人员缺乏，曾聘请北大、清华两校助教与同学参加。同时吸收区村干部及有经验的群众参加测量。开工以前，各区都分别召开了沿河村庄干部会议，明确指出挖河是保证生产、结合救灾的重要工作。并以区为单位，组织了挖河指挥部，掌握与领导全部工程，各村自愿组成挖河大队、分队和小组。
    沿河翻身后的农民，深深认识到政府领导挖河，是为了协助自己保护劳动果实，工作情绪很高。虽然挖河时水凉风大，有些渠土还冻着，但大家始终坚持了工作。参加挖河的妇女、老头也和壮年一样积极。区、村干部和党、团员起了积极的带头作用。十六区黑塔村与门头村的参加挖河的农民说：“别说还赚小米，就是不赚小米，也得好好干，这是给自己干活。”十三区北岗子村萧世安的老母亲，自动地给挖河工人送水。
    群众在挖河过程中，创造了许多科学办法。十四区南小街、大红门村的干部们集体研究技术，挖出样子，让群众学习。他们在河沟中打上中桩、底口桩、上口桩作标准，以避免宽窄不一的毛病。十三区驹子房村群众用秫秸按照标准断面作了模型，挖河时按照模型去作。大黄庄和黄杉木店村在开工前先挖好一段标准样子，大家都学会了。这样，大大提高了工作效率。南小街，南苑镇因而提早完成了任务，获得区人民政府奖给“光荣旗”一面。
    京郊疏浚河流的工作，得到广大群众的热烈拥护，都说这是大善政。鱼地村贫农王亮说：“我分的二亩地今后可涝不着了。”东湖渠村刘德全说：“只有共产党来了才能挖河，国民党在时那管这个！”
    治河工程中的缺点是：某些区、村干部缺乏群众观点，缺乏计划性，开会、编组、领粮、选模范占去时间不少，浪费农民生产时间；行政命令的工作作风也严重存在着。
