How the Dalian Transportation Company Electric Tram Factory Branch Improved Party-Masses Relations

　　The Dalian Transportation Company Electric Tram Factory now has very good Party-masses relations. However, the situation was not good in the past. In the past, some Party members of the Dalian Transportation Company Electric Tram Factory would record in a small notebook any grumbling from the masses and report it to the branch; some Party members were production team leaders who often didn't consult with the master workers on how to do things, but simply dictated how things should be done; some Party members were apprentices who often "glared and peeled skin" and "talked back" to their masters, which damaged Party-masses relations. The branch tried to improve Party-masses relations by having Party members befriend the masses, but this method didn't work because the Party members went about befriending the masses in a mechanical way.

　　Last December, the factory proposed launching a "Safe Kilometers Traveled Movement," and the general branch also proposed creating model branches, model teams, and model Party member movements within this campaign. The Electric Workshop Branch then convened a branch meeting to discuss how to ensure the completion of the task and strive to become a model branch. At the meeting, everyone discussed and said: "The Iron Shop Team is the most important workshop in the entire factory's production. If we do a good job in the Iron Shop Team, we can guarantee half of the work." However, in the past, the Party members in the Iron Shop Team were the most detached from the masses. For example, Party member Yu Jingyue had beaten Master Jin, who then reported him to the General Trade Union. Comrade Chen, a technician, said: "In the past, I thought it was enough to have Party members in production, but I didn't realize that the work isn't done by one person alone, we must rely on the strength of the masses." In the end, the branch proposed: The quality of our Party-masses relations determines the success or failure of the production task. It called on everyone to make plans to overcome this shortcoming. The branch committee should go deep into the Iron Shop Team to understand the situation and help solve difficulties. Since then, Party members have engaged in criticism and self-criticism at Party meetings, mutually examining and urging each other to correct the style of being detached from the masses, and exchanging methods for uniting the masses, gradually improving Party-masses relations. What methods were used to improve Party-masses relations? According to the branch's research, there are four methods: (1) In production, respect the opinions of the masses. Because the work is not done by one person alone, especially the old workers, we must consult with them about everything, and the masses' enthusiasm will be high. Party members must take the lead in working hard and constantly study working methods and improve tools with the masses to continuously improve production. (2) Adopt different methods of uniting different objects. For example, Master Jin is a person who "turns his face and doesn't recognize anyone," so we must be patient with him. Production team leader Sun, a worker, is a "go-alonger," nicknamed "Monkey," so don't lose your temper with him, be patient in persuading him, and provide individual assistance. (3) Promote the strengths of the masses more, and Party members should learn from the strengths of the masses; be more patient in persuading and educating the masses about their shortcomings, criticize less; Party members should be modest in small matters; in big matters, if the masses' thinking is not clear, conduct discussions and persuasion until their opinions are consistent, and then there will be strength in doing the work. (4) Party member apprentices should respect their masters, do more odd jobs for their masters, be diligent in learning and asking questions, and listen to their masters' instructions, and they will learn quickly. The branch used these methods to unite the masses. This year, the task of renovating twenty trams, decorating twenty trams, and overhauling is very heavy. There is a shortage of eleven grade six or above old workers, but the masters are willing to put in the effort and lead the work. By changing the labor organization, as long as three apprentices are added, the completion of this year's task can be guaranteed.

　　大连交通公司电车工厂支部怎样改善党群关系
    大连交通公司电车工厂现在的党群关系是很好的。但是，过去的情形则很不好。过去，大连交通公司电车工厂的某些党员，一听到群众说句牢骚话，就用小本记起来到支部去汇报；有些党员是生产小组长，他们经常什么活也不和老师研究，个人说怎样干就怎样干；有些党员是学徒，他们则常跟老师“瞪眼扒皮”，“顶嘴”，因此党群关系闹的不好。支部为搞好党群关系曾用过党员和群众交朋友的办法，但由于党员机械的去找群众交朋友，这个办法也没行得通。
    去年十二月工厂提出开展“安全行走公里运动”，总支也提出在这运动中创造模范支部、模范小组，模范党员运动。电工支部便召开支部会，研究怎样保证完成任务，争取当个模范支部。会上大家讨论说：“铁场组，在全厂生产上是最重要的车间，把铁场组搞好，就能保证一半。”但是铁场组过去党员脱离群众最厉害。如党员于景岳曾打过金师傅，被金师傅告到总工会。技术员陈同志说：“过去我想生产上有了党员就行，没想到活不是一个人干的，非得依靠群众力量不行。”讨论到最后，支部提出：我们党群关系搞的好坏，就决定生产任务完成的好坏。号召大家都要订出计划，克服这个毛病。支委要深入铁场组了解情况帮助解决困难。此后，党员在党的会议上展开批评与自我批评，互相检查督促改正脱离群众的作风，并交流团结群众的办法，使党群关系逐渐好转。用些什么方法搞好党群关系呢？根据支部的研究，有四个办法：（一）在生产上要尊重群众意见。因为活不是一个人干的，特别是老工友，遇事要跟他们商量，群众干的情绪就高。党员更得带头苦干，和群众经常研究工作办法，改造工具，这样就能不断提高生产。（二）对不同的对象，采取不同的团结方法。如金师傅是个“翻脸不认人”的人，对他要沉住气。生产小组长孙工友是个“顺毛驴”外号叫“马猴子”，对他千万不要动态度发脾气，要多耐心说服，个别帮助才行。（三）要多发扬群众的优点，党员要学习群众的长处；对群众的缺点要多耐心说服教育，少批评；小事情党员要谦让；大事情群众思想不通时展开讨论，说服，意见一致了，干活才有力量。（四）党员学徒要尊重老师，多替老师干零碎活，要勤学好问，听老师吩咐，学的就快。支部用了这些办法，团结了群众。今年改造二十台车，装修二十台，检修任务也很重，缺少十一名六级以上的老工友，但是老师肯出力领着干，改变一下劳动组织，只要上三名徒工，就能保证完成今年的任务。
