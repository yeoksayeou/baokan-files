    In several small and medium-sized cities in North China, the work of widely promoting the signing of labor-management collective contracts is underway. Since Hebei Province started in Baoding City in July last year, it has now been extended to eleven cities, including Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and Qinhuangdao. Shanxi Province started in Taiyuan and has now been extended to Changzhi, Yuci, Pingyao, Xinjiang and other towns. In addition, Zhangjiakou, Zhangbei, Xuanhua, and Yuxian in Chahar Province, Xinxiang and Jiaozuo in Pingyuan Province, and Guisui and Jining in Suiyuan Province are also focusing on the work of establishing collective contracts.
    When signing contracts, the majority of labor and management in various industries are able to consider issues from the perspective of developing production benefits. Therefore, after the contract is signed, the production volume of general industries has gradually increased. For example, in the Xuanhua City hemp paper industry, the labor and management jointly formed a production technology research committee, starting from discussing how to ensure improved paper quality. On the one hand, they researched technology, and on the other hand, they assessed wages based on the workers' technical skills and the quality of the products. After the wages were determined, the standards for increasing wages when workers over-fulfilled the paper copying quantity were specifically stipulated in the contract. Therefore, after the contract was signed, the industry not only eliminated the past phenomenon of workers copying fewer sheets of paper than required but also significantly improved the quantity and quality of the products. In the Tangshan City porcelain kiln industry, due to the stipulation of a "more work, more pay" wage system in the collective contract, the production volume of many workers exceeded the prescribed amount by 20% to 30%. In addition to the porcelain kiln industry, 34 other industries in the city have signed contracts, and the production volume has generally increased by 20%. The manager of Baoding Xinhua Printing Factory once wanted to reduce operations and dismiss workers under the pretext of business losses before the contract was signed. However, after the contract was signed, the business gradually improved, and the factory instead added five more workers. After the contracts were signed in various industries, unreasonable treatment of workers by the capitalists has been completely or partially eliminated. For example, corporal punishment of workers and apprentices has been abolished in several industries; the working hours of general factories have been stipulated to be no more than ten hours; and there are certain procedures and methods for factories to dismiss workers.
    In the small and medium-sized cities of North China, the industries are generally decentralized and of small scale. According to statistics from nine special districts and four cities in Hebei Province, there are only 235 factories with more than fifteen people using machines or semi-machine production. In various industries, the capitalists' exploitation of workers is very serious. For example, in the past, the capitalists in the Baoding printing industry could arbitrarily deduct workers' wages. There are often no regulations on the treatment of apprentices in certain industries; after the apprenticeship period expires, the capitalists do not give them the treatment of formal workers. In many industries, the capitalists even arbitrarily give workers and apprentices corporal punishment.
    Based on the above situation, when carrying out the work of establishing contracts, some regions first concentrate cadres, focus on selecting one or two cities, and start with industries in the city that are doing well; after obtaining certain experience and achievements, they extend it to general industries and other regions. Baoding, Tangshan, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou and other places have adopted this method to carry out the work of establishing contracts, and as a result, they have achieved significant results. At the same time, in the process of establishing contracts in many cities, the leading organizations jointly composed of trade unions, labor bureaus, and industrial and commercial bureaus first explain policies to both labor and management, mobilize both parties to fully deliberate, and lead the formulation of collective contracts. However, some shortcomings have also occurred in the process of establishing contracts in various places. For example, some local cadres only cared about meeting the excessive demands of the workers when signing contracts, resulting in excessively high wages and dismissal conditions. In some places, when promoting the work of establishing contracts, the local government trade unions failed to concentrate their efforts and delve deeply, but only entrusted a few trade union cadres or labor bureau cadres to create "typical" experiences, so that the establishment of contracts was limited to a few industries and did not spread widely.

### 华北若干中小城市行业广泛签订劳资集体合同

　　华北若干中小城市行业广泛签订劳资集体合同
    【新华社六日讯】华北若干中小城市正广泛推行签订劳资集体合同的工作。河北省从去年七月在保定市开始以来，现已推广到唐山、石家庄、秦皇岛等十一个城市。山西省从太原开始，现已推广到长治、榆次、平遥、新绛等市镇。此外，察哈尔省的张家口、张北、宣化、蔚县等地，平原省的新乡、焦作等地，绥远省的归绥、集宁等地，亦正在有重点地展开订立集体合同的工作。
    若干行业的劳资双方在订立合同时，大多数能够从发展生产的利益出发来考虑问题，因此在合同订立后，一般行业的生产量均已逐步提高。如宣化市麻纸业在订立合同中，从讨论保证纸质的提高出发，由劳资双方合组生产技术研究委员会，一方面研究技术，一方面根据职工的技术优劣和产品质量好坏来评定工资。工资确定后，并在合同上具体规定了工人在超额完成抄纸数量时增加工资的标准。因此，该业在订立合同后，不但消除了过去工人抄纸短数的现象，并且显著地提高了产品的数量和质量。唐山市磁窑业由于在集体合同中规定了多劳多得的工资制，很多工人的生产量都超过了规定数额的百分之二十到三十。该市除磁窑业外，尚有三十四个行业订立了合同，生产量一般都提高了百分之二十。保定新华印刷厂经理，在合同订立前，曾经想借口营业亏本，来缩小经营和解雇工人。但在合同订后，营业渐趋好转，厂里反而多添了五名工人。各行业在订立合同后，资方对于工人的不合理的待遇已得到全部或部分取消。如若干行业已废除工人、学徒的体罚处分；一般工厂的工作时间，已规定不超过十小时；工厂解雇工人也有了一定的手续和办法。
    华北各中小城市的行业，一般都是分散的、小规模的生产。就河北一省九个专区、四个市的统计，十五个人以上的机器或半机器生产的工厂，仅有二百三十五个。在各行业中，资方对于工人的剥削很重。如保定印刷业资方过去可以随意折扣工人的工资。若干行业对于学徒的待遇多无规定；学徒期满，资方亦不给予正式工人的待遇。在不少行业中，资方甚至随意给予工人、学徒以体罚处分。
    根据以上情况，若干地区在进行订立合同的工作时，首先是集中干部，有重点地选择一两个城市，并从该城市中营业较好的行业着手做起；等到取得一定的经验和成绩之后，再推广到一般行业和其他的地区。保定、唐山、太原、张家口等地，都采取这种方式进行订立合同的工作，结果获得了显著的成绩。同时，许多城市的行业在订立合同的过程中，工会、劳动局、工商局等联合组成的领导机构，事先向劳资双方进行解释政策并发动双方充分酝酿，并领导制定集体合同。但是，各地在订立合同的过程中，也曾经发生过一些缺点。如有些地方干部在订合同时，只顾满足工人们的过高要求，致把工资和解雇条件等提得过高。有些地方在推行订立合同的工作时，由于当地政府工会方面未能集中力量重点深入，只委托几个工会干部或劳动局干部去创造“典型”经验，致使合同的订立只局限于少数行业，而没有广泛地展开。
