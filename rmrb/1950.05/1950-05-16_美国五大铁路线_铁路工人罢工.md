　　US Five Major Railroads
　　Railway Workers Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th] TASS, New York: 18,000 members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, an independent union in the United States, began a strike on five major US railroads on the 10th. The strike was caused by the company's rejection of the workers' demands for improved working conditions. The strikers' demands are supported by the union's members on other major lines. The strike, initiated on only five railway lines, makes it impossible for Truman to declare a "national emergency" under the anti-labor law and for the US government to "take over" the railways.

　　铁路工人罢工
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社纽约消息：属于美国独立的火夫与司机兄弟会的一万八千名会员，于十日开始在美国五大铁路线举行罢工。罢工是工人要求改善工作条件为路方所拒绝而引起的。罢工者的要求获得该工会在其他大路线上的会员的支持。罢工只在五条铁路线上发动，使杜鲁门不能根据反劳工法宣布“全国紧急状态”，并由美国政府“接管”铁路。
