　　New China's Women on the Yi River
　　By our correspondent Yong Jin
　　From the Maling Mountains in Xin'an County, Huaihai District, to the mouth of the Guan River on the coast of the Yellow Sea, along the four-hundred-li-long Xin Yi River in northern Jiangsu, there are over 20,000 women among the ranks of 300,000 laborers. Among these women are village cadres, old women in their forties and fifties, young wives, and young girls. Some of them have traveled over a hundred li to come to the Xin Yi River.

　　In the most arduous work of cutting the ridge at the Maling Mountains, they brave the continuous spring rain, working barefoot on the hard gravel ground. Zhang Guizhen is a strong female Communist Party member. She leads 240 male and female laborers in the ridge-cutting work at the Maling Mountains, and their work efficiency exceeds that of ordinary laborers by more than one-third. Last year, during the grain transportation work, she organized more than a hundred women to complete the tasks assigned by the higher authorities and was promoted to the head of Xiaohu Township in Xin'an County.

　　In Gaoliu District, there are a total of 150 women who push earth and cook. During their work, they proposed a competition with the men. Sister-in-law Sun, who came to the river construction with her husband, said, "We women can't let others say we are lagging behind. We'll use as much strength as we have." The women not only have no time to rest during the day; even at night when the laborers are resting, you can hear the sound of women grinding grain when you pass by the river construction site. In the Paochē District, I met Wang Lanying, a probationary Party member. She is only nineteen years old this year. I heard that her husband was unwilling to work on the river construction, so she came back from her parents' home and volunteered to participate in the river opening project. She cooks at the river construction site. She makes the meals early in the morning and also goes to collect firewood and push earth during the day. In the first phase of the Shuyang County section, Yu Qinglan, a special-class model worker, emerged. She is one of the four special-class model workers in the Huaihai District. Yu Qinglan is a Party member. After helping the township head bring more than two hundred male and female laborers to the river construction site, she led thirteen women to work, digging more than 1,200 jin of vegetables. In addition to cooking for thirteen people, she also carried an average of seventy baskets of earth every day. Under her leadership and promotion, twelve women actively served the laborers.

　　On the Xin Yi River, the leading role played by the Youth League members is also very significant. Duan Cuilan, a Youth League branch committee member from Huxi Village in Huxi Township, is an eighteen-year-old robust girl. Her family was not affected by the disaster, and she came to the river construction site entirely for the water conservancy construction of New China. She proposed that she would like to make contributions to the Yi River project and strive to join the Communist Party. In her work, she demonstrated superhuman labor. She alone is responsible for cooking for sixteen people; in order to enable the heavily affected laborers to earn grain to solve the livelihood of their families, she picks wild vegetables every day, saving a lot of food for the entire group. In addition, she has to push eighty carts of earth every day. In her challenge letter to Wu Shuping, a female model in the Shizi District, she said: "1. Guarantee that the laborers' shoes will not be broken; 2. Guarantee meals on time; 3. Guarantee pushing three cubic meters of earth every day; 4. Guarantee the development of Youth League members." Because of her selfless labor, the District Committee of the Communist Party of China is preparing to accept her as a Party member. One evening, in the Shizi District, I saw a female worker team led by two female Youth League members, Lu Shulan and Fan Cuihua. The cofferdam they worked on was close to the cofferdam worked on by the male team. Therefore, they often competed with the male laborers. They asked the male laborers not to rest until they carried thirty baskets of earth, excluding the ramming work. The male workers only carried 2.8 cubic meters a day, but they reached three cubic meters. They completed their seventy-five-day task in twenty-six days.

　　Many of the women are family members of soldiers, and they have shown great enthusiasm for labor for the construction of the motherland. He Peilan, from Xinzhuang Village, is the wife of a cadre of the Northern Jiangsu Military Region. She demonstrated amazing labor ability on the river construction site. Before dawn, she grinds more than thirty jin of grain and cooks for more than twenty people by herself. Whenever she has free time, she washes clothes and mends shoes for the male laborers. Sun Ernai from Dexing Village in Guanyun County, the village took care of her as a military family member and did not ask her to provide grass, but she rejected the village cadre's opinion: Now the river needs grass, it doesn't need everyone to take care of me. She and her daughter-in-law braved the strong wind and sent the grass to the river construction site. At the river construction site in the Tanggou District, I met Yang Jinlan, a Communist Party member. She led five female workers. At the river construction site, she used the story of the three attacks on the Chaimi River embankment (Chaimi River is located in Guanyun County. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Chiang bandits demolished the river embankment three times, and we fought back three times, hence the name "Three Attacks on the Chaimi River Embankment") to educate the masses, comparing and explaining the difference between the Kuomintang's opposition to the government in the past and the people's government's attitude towards the interests of the masses today, so that the women in the whole group deeply recognized the significance of digging the river and inspired their enthusiasm for labor. Yang Jinlan's group averaged 3.2 cubic meters of earth dug per person per day, and rested only after pushing thirty-one carts of earth at a stretch. They said: "How much do the men push, we push as much; we can only push more, not less." They have a strong revolutionary heroism and competitive spirit.

　　In the northeast corner of Shuyang City is the project of Suqian County. Every cofferdam that has been dug is full of water. The laborers who dig the river have to stand in the water to work, and the women also work barefoot in the cofferdam. Guo Lanzhen, who works here, is a middle-aged woman. She was a female guerrilla in the self-defense war, and she once killed two enemies. In the first phase of the river management project, she was awarded the second-class merit. Even now, her legs still bear the marks of being pierced by ice when she went into the water in winter to dig mud.

　　The New China women on the Yi River project are working hard, carrying out the great construction tasks given to them by the state. They realize that only through labor can they improve their status, and only by working hard can they change their poor lives.

　　April 6th, in Shuyang City, Northern Jiangsu

　　新中国妇女在沂河上
    本报记者　勇进
    从淮海分区新安县的马陵山到黄海边的灌河口，长四百里的苏北新沂河线上，三十万劳动人民的行列里，有两万多妇女。这些妇女中间，有的是乡村干部，有的是四五十岁的老大娘，还有青年大嫂与年轻的姑娘。她们有的是从百多里外跑到新沂河上来的。
    在最坚苦的马陵山切岭工作中，她们冒着绵绵的春雨，赤着脚在坚硬的砂礓地面紧张地工作着。张贵真是一个坚强的女共产党员，她领导着二百四十个男女民工，在马陵山切岭工作中，工作效率超过了一般民工的三分之一以上。她在去年运粮工作中，组织了一百多妇女完成了上级所给的任务，被提拔为新安县小湖乡的乡长。
    在高留区，推土和做饭的妇女共有一百五十名，在工作中她们提出与男子竞赛。俩口子都来开河的孙大嫂说：“我们妇女不能叫人家说落后，有多大力用多大力。”妇女们不仅白天没有休息的时间；夜里民工们都休息了，当你从河工上通过时，也会听到妇女们推磨的声音。在炮车区我碰见了候补党员王兰英，她今年才十九岁。听说她男人不愿不河工，她就从娘家回来，自动来参加开河工程。她在河工上做饭，一早将饭做好，白天还自己去拾柴推土。在沭阳县工段的第一期，出现了特等功臣尤庆兰，她是淮海分区四个特等功臣里的一个。尤庆兰是个党员，她帮助乡长将二百余男女民工带到河工上以后，领导着十三个妇女工作，挖菜一千二百多斤。她一个人除做十三个人的饭外，还平均每天抬七十筐土。在她的带头与推动下，十二个妇女都积极的为民工服务。
    在新沂河上，青年团员们所起的带头作用也是很大的。在湖西乡湖西村的村青年团支部委员段萃兰，她是一个十八岁身体魁伟的姑娘。她家没有受灾，她来河工上完全是为了新中国的水利建设。她自己提出要在沂河工程上立功，争取参加共产党。在工作中，她表现了超人的劳动，她一个人负责做十六个人的饭；为使灾重的民工赚得粮回家解决全家生活，她每天拔野菜，使全组里节约很多粮食。此外，她每天还要推八十车子土。她在对十字区妇女模范吴树萍的挑战书上说：一、保证不使民工鞋破；二、保证按时吃饭；三、保证每天推三公方土，四、保证发展青年团员。由于她的忘我的劳动，该区中共区委会正准备接受她为党员。一个黄昏，在十字区我看到一个女工班，该班由两个女青年团员卢树兰与范萃华所领导，她们工作的方塘，与男子班工作的方塘紧靠着，因此，她们经常与男民工们进行比赛，她们向男民工提出不抬三十筐土不能休息，硪工还不在内。男工一天只抬二点八公方，她们却达到三公方。他们七十五天的任务，是在二十六天内完成的。
    妇女中有不少是军人家属，她们为了祖国的建设，表现出极大的劳动热情。新庄村的何培兰，她是苏北军区某干部的妻子，她在河工上表现了惊人的劳动能力。天不明她就磨出三十多斤粮，一个人做二十多个人的饭，一有了空就给男民工洗衣补鞋子。灌云县德兴村孙二奶，村上照顾她是军属不叫她出草，她拒绝了村干的意见：现在河上需要草，不需要大家照顾我。她与她儿媳妇冒着大风把草送到河工上。在塘沟区的河工上，我认识了共产党员杨金兰，她领导着五个女工，在河工上她用三打柴米河堤的故事（柴米河在灌云县境，抗日时期蒋匪曾三次扒河堤，我们曾三次予以打击，故称三打柴米河堤）来教育群众，对比的说明过去国民党反对政府与今天人民政府对群众利益态度的不同，使全组的妇女都深刻的认识挖河的意义，启发她们的劳动热忱。杨金兰组平均每人每日挖土三点二公方，一气推三十一车子才休息。她们说：“男子们推多少，我们也推多少；只能多推，不能少推。”他们具有强烈的革命英雄主义的争胜心。
    在沭阳城东北角是宿迁县的工程，每个挖过的方塘都是满满的水，挖河的民工要站在水里工作，妇女们同样赤着脚下塘工作。在这里工作的郭兰真，是个中年妇女，她在自卫战争中是女游击队员，她曾击毙过两个敌人。在第一期治河工程中，她被评为二等功臣。直到现在，她的腿部还留着冬季下水挖泥被冰扎破的痕迹。
    在沂河工程上的新中国妇女们，她们艰苦的劳动着，执行着国家给予她们的伟大建设任务。她们认识，只有从劳动中才能提高自己的地位，只有努力劳动才能改变自己的贫困生活。                    四月六日于苏北沭阳城
