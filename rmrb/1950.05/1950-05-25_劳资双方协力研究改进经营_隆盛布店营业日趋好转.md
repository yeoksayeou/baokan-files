　　Labor-Management Cooperation in Research and Improvement of Operations
    Longsheng Cloth Store's Business Improves Daily
    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Lin Hong reports: The establishment of a labor-management consultation meeting at the private Longsheng Cloth Store has led to a daily improvement in its business. In August and September of last year, business at Longsheng Cloth Store was not good. Daily turnover was only several hundred thousand yuan. By the end of the year, daily revenue was more than one million yuan, but even with a profit margin of 1.5%, it was not enough to cover expenses. At that time, morale was low on both sides. The management lost confidence in the business's future. The workers were worried about unemployment. The union group in the store was determined to change this situation. First, they researched a set of methods at the union group meeting. Then, they brought it up at the store's existing, but irregularly scheduled, labor-management business review meeting. Seeing that the workers were not discussing welfare issues at the meeting, but were concerned about the business in every way, the management's mood improved. In a harmonious atmosphere, after detailed discussion, they finally agreed that only by changing the business strategy, selling cloth needed by the people, and strengthening publicity work, could the business improve. Both sides also decided to hold a business review meeting once a week in the future to jointly review the business situation and resolve relevant labor-management issues.
    Since the first business review meeting, the store immediately sold off silk and other slow-moving goods at low prices, replenished with ordinary cloth, and the business situation gradually improved. Before April 18th, the store's daily turnover averaged more than 1.5 million yuan. After expenses, there was some surplus, which enabled it to pay off debts of about 20 million yuan incurred from paying public bonds and taxes. However, while repaying the debts, a merchant from Qingdao withdrew 150 bolts of cloth previously stored in the store, and the business experienced a crisis. In addition to striving to stabilize the management's mood, the store's employees persuaded private individuals who had goods stored in the store not to withdraw them and suggested that the management reduce prices to sell goods. Therefore, the store safely overcame the crisis. Since late April, the store's business has further improved, with daily turnover at a minimum of more than 2 million yuan and a maximum of more than 5 million yuan.
    The wages of the store's employees were originally lower than those of other stores. Recently, due to improved business, with the consent of both labor and management, appropriate adjustments were made. However, seeing that the store still did not have enough working capital, in order to expand business, the labor side decided to temporarily deposit the increased wages on the counter as working capital.
    The store has now formally established a labor-management consultation meeting on the basis of the labor-management business review meeting. Labor and management each send two representatives to participate, and the meeting is held once a week, with the chairmanship rotated between the two sides.

### 劳资双方协力研究改进经营  隆盛布店营业日趋好转

　　劳资双方协力研究改进经营
    隆盛布店营业日趋好转
    【本报讯】记者林洪报道：私营隆盛布店建立劳资协商会议，营业情况日趋好转。去年八、九月，隆盛布店的生意很不好。每日营业流水只有几十万元。到了年底，每天营业收入一百多万元，以一分五的利润计算，仍然不够开支。当时，劳资双方的情绪都不高。资方对营业前途失去信心。劳方存在着失业的顾虑。该店工会小组决心改变这种情况。先在工会小组会上研究出一套办法，接着，便在该店已经存在但不定期的劳资业务检讨会上提出来。资方见工人在会上不是谈福利问题，而是处处关心营业，情绪便高起来。双方在和谐的气氛下，经详细研讨，最后一致认为只有改变营业方针，售卖为人民大众所需要的布匹，并加强宣传工作，才能使营业好转。双方并决定以后每星期开业务检讨会一次，共同检讨营业情况，解决有关劳资问题。
    该店自第一次业务检讨会后，即将丝、绸等销路不畅的背货低价甩卖，补进了一般布匹，营业情况即逐渐好转。四月十八日以前，该店每日流水平均有一百五十多万元，除开支外，还有若干盈余，得以还清因缴纳公债、税款所借的约两千万元的债务。但在偿还债款的同时，青岛某商家将旧存该店的一百五十匹布提走了，营业曾一度发生危机。该店职工除努力稳定资方的情绪外，并说服在该店有存货的私人不再提货，建议资方减价售货，因此该店安然渡过危机。四月下旬以来，该店营业复进一步好转，每日流水最低有二百多万元，最高达到五百多万元。
    该店职工工资原较其他商店为低，近因营业好转，经劳资双方同意，作了适当调整。但劳方看到店内现在资金仍不够周转，为了扩大营业，复决定将已增加的工资暂存柜上，充当周转资金。
    该店现已在劳资业务检讨会的基础上，正式组成劳资协商会议。劳资双方各推代表二人参加，每周开会一次，由双方轮流担任主席。
