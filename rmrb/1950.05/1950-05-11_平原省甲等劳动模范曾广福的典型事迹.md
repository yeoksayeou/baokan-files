　　Typical Deeds of Zeng Guangfu, Model Laborer of Jia Grade in Pingyuan Province
　　Wang Zezhong
　　Zeng Guangfu is from Dujia Village, Fifth District, Xin County, Pingyuan Province. His family was poor. When he was a child, he begged for food in the village. At the age of sixteen, he became a long-term hired laborer for the landlord, living a life worse than a beast of burden for thirteen years. It was only after the Communist Party came here that he was rescued from the pit of fire. After rent reduction and interest reduction and land reform in the village, the peasants were liberated. Zeng Guangfu profoundly understood who gave him the days of liberation. Therefore, he was determined to work for everyone. Because he was always at the forefront of various tasks in the village, he was elected as a village cadre.

　　South of Dujia Village is a low-lying field, especially an important road leading to Shangnan land which is even lower-lying. In August last year, it rained continuously for several days. A patch of low-lying fields turned muddy, and white rain water accumulated at the intersection, making it difficult for the farmers in the village to do farm work in the fields. If they used carts to transport manure to the South Land, they would have to detour more than three miles to the west. Usually they could deliver five or six trips a day, but this way they could only deliver two or three trips at most, which was a significant delay. This matter weighed on Zeng Guangfu's mind at all times. He thought: If a way to get rid of the water is not quickly devised, how much work will the production of the village's masses be delayed! Especially with the wheat planting season fast approaching, if the water at this intersection is not eliminated, the delivery of manure and plowing of land will definitely be delayed, and the wheat will have to be planted late. Thinking of this, he was determined to scoop the water off the road and let everyone pass with their carts. His strength alone was small, so he mobilized everyone. However, some people said, "This is nonsense, how can it work?" Some said, "It doesn't matter to go around a few steps." Others said, "It doesn't matter if we deliver a few less loads of manure." These people felt that it was not worth it to walk and scoop the water themselves. Later, after Zeng Guangfu continued to mobilize everyone, many people were persuaded. He organized a dozen young and strong men to take water scoops, led by him, to scoop water at the village's south road intersection. It was the middle of August, and the water was very cold, but they kept scooping. By sunset, the water had been scooped away, but there was still mud underneath, making it difficult to drive carts. At this time, Zeng Guangfu suggested that everyone contribute some firewood to pad the intersection. But many people were unwilling. Some people said, "The firewood we burn is not enough for ourselves, and if we pad some more, it will be even less to burn." So he said to everyone, "Don't worry, first move my family's firewood out to pad it." As a result, several families followed suit, carrying bundles of firewood to pad the intersection. They dug out some of the mud, padded it with firewood, and carts could pass. This matter influenced the masses of the entire village and inspired the production enthusiasm of the entire village's masses, who accelerated their efforts to deliver manure to the land, forming a surge.

　　A few days later, the weather suddenly changed, and there was another hailstorm with rain. When the weather cleared, the hail melted into water and flowed together with the rainwater to the village's south road intersection again, blocking vehicle traffic. It was dark, and Zeng Guangfu thought: It will probably be more difficult to ask the masses to go again than last time. After he went to sleep, he woke up again, unable to forget this matter. If the water was not removed, he would not be able to haul carts and deliver manure tomorrow. So he put on his clothes, took his tools, and went to scoop water by himself. In the middle of the night, the cold north wind was whistling, and the water was even colder. At this moment, besides thinking that this was for everyone, he also thought of the soldiers at the front, who were fighting even harder at the front, coming and going in the snow and rain, climbing mountains and ridges, and fighting the enemy under the rain of bullets. As he thought, he fought against the accumulated water at the intersection with the water scoop in the cold night. He scooped until the cock crowed three times, and the water was scooped dry. He turned over the firewood underneath, sorted it out, saw that the carts could pass, and then took his tools home to rest.

　　The next day, this matter quickly spread throughout the village, and the mass production movement became even more enthusiastic.

　　平原省甲等劳动模范曾广福的典型事迹
　　王泽中
    曾广福是平原省莘县五区杜家村人，从前家境贫穷，小时候在村里要饭，到了十六岁那年，就给地主扛活当长工，一直过了整整十三年牛马不如的日子。共产党到了这里后，他才从火坑里被救了出来。村里经过了减租减息，土地改革，农民得到了翻身解放。曾广福深刻地知道自己得到翻身解放的日子是谁给的。因此他就决心要为大家工作。由于他对村中各样工作都干在前头，被大家选为村干部。
    杜家村南是一片低洼田野，特别是上南地去的一个重要路口更比较低洼。去年八月里，阴雨连绵，大雨一直下了好几天，一片洼田变成泥泞，白茫茫的雨水积在路口上，使该村农民到地里作农活很困难。他们用车拉粪到南地去，就得要往西绕三里多地才行。平日每天能送五六趟，这样却最多只能送两三趟，误事真是不小。这个事情使曾广福时刻挂在心上。他想：如不赶快想办法将水去掉，村里群众的生产，得耽误多少工夫啊！特别是种麦季节快到了，如不把这路口的水消灭，送粪、耕地一定会误大事的，麦子也就得要晚种上。他想到这里，下定了决心，要把路口上的水泼干，让大家过车。他一人力量小，于是就动员大家。可是，有些人就说：“这是瞎胡闹哩，那能办事啦？”有的说：“绕几步远也不算啥。”还有的说：“少送几趟粪也不要紧”。这些人都是觉得大家走路，要自己来泼水，不值得。后来经过曾广福继续向大家动员，不少群众才被说服。他便组织了十来个青壮年拿着梢筒，由他带领着到村南路口泼水去了。这正是八月中旬的天气，水凉得很，但他们一直不停的泼着。太阳偏西的时候，把水泼净了，但是底下还有泥，行车仍是很难。这时曾广福提出大家出点柴火把路口垫上。但是许多人都不愿意，有的人说：“自己烧的已不够，再垫些更不够烧了。”于是他就向大家说：“别作难啦，先把我家的柴草搬出来垫上它。”这样一来，随着就有好几家，一捆一捆的把柴草抱出来垫在路口上。他们把泥挖出了一些，垫上了柴草，就能行车了。这样事情影响了全村的群众，把全村群众的生产情绪都鼓动了起来，纷纷加紧送粪上地，形成了热潮。
    隔了几天后，天气突变，连雹子带雨又下了一场。等天晴云散，雹子化成水，同雨水一起又流到了村南路口，阻止了车辆的交通。天黑了，曾广福想道：再叫群众去恐怕要比上次更难。他睡觉以后，一会又醒来，这事情怎么样也忘不掉，要是不把水去掉，明天又不能拉车送粪了。他于是就穿了衣裳拿着用具独自泼水去了。深夜里寒冷的北风呼呼的吹着，水更是凉得很。在这个当儿，他除了想这是为的大家以外，又想起了前方的战士们，他们在前方打仗更是艰苦，雪里来雨里去，爬山越岭，在枪林弹雨之下和敌人拚。他一面想，一面在寒冷的深夜，用梢筒哗啦哗啦和路口的积水搏斗着。一直泼到鸡叫三遍把水泼干了。他又把底下的柴草翻了翻，整理了一下，看看可以过车了，才拿着用具回家休息了。
    到了第二天，这个事情很快传遍了全村，于是群众的生产运动就更热烈的开展起来了。
