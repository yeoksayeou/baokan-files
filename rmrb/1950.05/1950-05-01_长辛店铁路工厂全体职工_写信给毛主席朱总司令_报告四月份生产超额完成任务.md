　　Changxindian Railway Factory All Employees
　　Write Letter to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
　　Reporting Over-fulfillment of April Production Tasks
　　[Our Newspaper News] Before the "May 1st" Labor Day, all the workers of the Changxindian Railway Factory wrote a letter to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, reporting on the production situation in April. The letter said:

Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu,
　　On the occasion of the first "May 1st" Labor Day after the founding of our People's Republic of China, we, all the staff and workers, salute you with excitement. You are busy and concerned about national affairs every day. Even so, Commander-in-Chief Zhu has come to the factory three times to care for us and encourage us. Especially on April 17th, he earnestly instructed us to "unite well, do a good job in production, only by doing a good job in production can we have permanent welfare, improve technology, make handicrafts automated and scientific, and rationalize labor organization..." These instructions moved us very much. We recall the revolutionary martyrs of the "February 7th" strike who won a glorious revolutionary history for our factory. Today, under your wise leadership, the revolution has been successful. We have become masters and should work harder to build and improve our own factory. Thinking of this, we feel the great responsibility. We are marching forward according to the instructions of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Indeed, we have not let you down. On this great "May 1st" Labor Day, we report to you the production situation in April:

　　In April, we overcame various difficulties and repaired 18 locomotives, 15 passenger cars, and 86 freight cars. Calculated in terms of major repairs, we exceeded the tasks given by the Ministry of Railways, namely, locomotives by 48.2 percent, passenger cars by 41.1 percent, and freight cars by 12.3 percent. This month, we saved the country 664,196 catties of millet. The output of each type of vehicle exceeded the output of any month during the enemy-puppet era and after liberation. We made a locomotive, a passenger car, and four freight cars with special care and exquisiteness as our gift to welcome May Day.

　　There is also one more thing to tell you: Since we launched the new record movement here, new records have been appearing every day. In the two months from March to now, 925 people have created 264 new records. For example, Han Run, an old worker of the "February 7th" strike, changed the planer, which could only hold two blades in the past, to hold four blades, which is almost equivalent to having one more machine. Zhu Maoheng and others studied substitute fish oil products, which can save more than 20 million yuan per month. The boiler team saved 170.223 tons of coal in a month by mixing sawdust into the coal, adding water to the coal, and evenly spreading the coal when burning it. There are many things like this.

　　But we will never be arrogant or complacent. Moreover, there are still many shortcomings in our work, such as the heating of the main shaft, some locomotives always have to slip a few times after leaving the factory, the monthly production is always loose first and then tight, the connection between the various workshops is not good enough, and some production systems have not been well established. We must continue to improve our work, please rest assured.

　　We wish you good health.

　　All the staff and workers of Changxindian Railway Factory
　　April 30, 1950

　　[Our Newspaper News] Reporter Yibing reported: The workers of Changxindian Railway Factory overfulfilled the tasks stipulated by the Ministry of Railways in April to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day. And take this as a reply to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's three visits to the factory. By the end of April, the factory had completed 18 locomotives, exceeding the target set by the ministry by 6 units (equivalent to 48.2 percent of major repairs); 15 passenger cars (equivalent to 41.1 percent of major repairs exceeding the target); and 86 freight cars (equivalent to 12.3 percent of major repairs exceeding the target set by the ministry). The staff and workers also refined one locomotive, one passenger car, and four freight cars as a gift for "May 1st". The task accepted by the factory is arduous. Most of the locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars entering the factory are broken and unusable dead cars or reconstructed cars. However, through the efforts of the staff and workers, the dead cars have finally been revived. In the production process, the staff and workers demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and actively cooperated with each other. When the locomotive and freight car work was tight, the repair and reproduction workshops drew manpower to help work without affecting the production of their own workshops; in order to ensure that the locomotives left the factory on schedule, the frame, repair, and furnace workshops guaranteed the supply of ingredients on schedule. When the locomotive was affected by axle heating before leaving the factory, the leading cadres of the factory administration, trade union, the Chinese Communist Party branch and the Communist Youth League, as well as engineers and workers, spent most of their time on the scene and concentrated on solving this problem. Wang Yinchun, an old engineer who is nearly 70 years old, personally worked with the workers to repair the axle tiles. Wang Shoulian, an old worker in the freight car yard who has worked in the factory's car house for 30 years and has rich locomotive experience, automatically asked to help the locomotive yard solve the problem of axle heating. In the last few days of April, none of the workers in the locomotive and mechanical workshops did not use their brains, and even the workers who were not directly responsible for repairing cars were concerned about the locomotives leaving the factory. Doctors and nurses went back and forth to various sites day and night to prevent temporary accidents. The soldiers of the guard team automatically ran to the locomotive, machinery, and other sites to help transport parts after the guard time was over. Under the tense work of all the staff and workers of the factory, they finally overfulfilled the tasks given by the superior.

　　长辛店铁路工厂全体职工
    写信给毛主席朱总司令   
    报告四月份生产超额完成任务
    【本报讯】长辛店铁路工厂全体职工于“五一”劳动节前夕，写信给毛主席朱总司令，报告四月份生产情况。信上说：毛主席朱总司令
    在咱们中华人民共和国成立后，第一个“五一”劳动节的日子，我们全体职工以兴奋的心情，向你们敬礼，你们为着国家大事，每天都在忙，都在操心。就是这样朱总司令还三次来厂，关心我们和勉励我们，特别在四月十七日，又谆谆嘱付我们“要好好的团结，要把生产搞好，搞好生产才能有永久的福利，要提高技术，把手工业方式，使之自动化，科学化，劳动组织要合理化……”这些指示使我们感动得很，我们回想“二七”革命先烈，给我们厂子里争下光荣的革命历史，今天在你们的英明领导下，革命成功了。我们作了主人，更应当努力建设，搞好自己的工厂。想到这里，我们感到责任的重大，我们正在照着毛主席、朱总司令的指示迈进，真的，我们没有辜负了你们的希望。在这伟大的“五一”劳动节日，我们向你们报告四月份的生产情况：
    四月份我们克服了种种困难，修好机车十八台，客车十五辆，货车八十六辆，折合大修计算，超过铁道部给的任务，即机车百分之四十八点二，客车百分之四十一点一，货车百分之十二点三。这一个月我们替国家节省了六十六万四千一百九十六斤小米，每种车辆均超过了敌伪时代及解放后任何一个月的产量，我们特别精致细作的做了一台机车、一辆客车和四辆货车，作为我们迎接五一的礼物。
    另外还有一件事告诉你们，我们这里自从开展新纪录运动以来，天天都有新纪录出现，从三月到现在两个月中已有九百二十五人创造新纪录二百六十四件：如“二七”老工友韩润把过去只能上两把刀的刨床改上四把刀，这就几乎等于多了一台机器。朱茂恒等研究代用鱼油制品，使每月可节省两千多万元。锅炉班把锯末渗在煤内，把煤内又渗上水并在勤烧煤铺的匀等方法上一月节一七○·二二三吨，诸如此类事情是很多的。
    但我们决不骄傲自满，何况我们工作中还存在着很多缺点，像大轴发热，一台机车出场有的总要溜几趟，每月生产总是先松后紧，各场间的连系不够好，有些生产制度还没有很好的建立起来等等。我们一定要继续改进我们的工作，请你们放心。
    祝你们身体健康
    长辛店铁路工厂全体职工上
     一九五○年四月三十日
    【本报讯】记者一兵报道：长辛店铁路工厂职工，四月份超额完成铁道部规定的任务，迎接“五一”劳动节。并以此作为给朱总司令三次巡视该厂的答礼。迄四月底，该厂已完成机车十八台，超过部定任务六台（折合大修百分之四十八点二）；客车十五辆（折合大修超过任务百分之四十一点一）；货车八十六辆（折合大修超过部定任务百分之十二点三）。职工们并精制其中之机车一台，客车一辆，货车四辆，作为“五一”的献礼。该厂所接受的任务是艰巨的，入场的机车、客车、货车，大部是破烂不堪的死车或重造车，但经职工们努力，终于使死车复活。在生产过程中，职工们发挥了高度的劳动热情，积极相互配合，机车、货车工作紧张时，修配、再制品等场在不影响本场生产的条件下，抽出人力帮助工作；为了保证机车如期出场，车架、修配、制炉等场保证如期供给配料。当机车因轮轴发热影响出场时，该厂行政、工会、中共支部和青年团的领导干部以及工程师、工务员等以大部分时间放在现场，集中精力解决这一问题。年近七十的老工程师王荫椿亲自动手和工人一起修理轴瓦，在该厂车房干了三十年、富有机车经验的货车场老工友王守林，自动要求帮助机车场解决轮轴发热现象。四月份最后几天，机车、机械两场的工友没有一个人不动脑筋，连不直接负修车责任的工友都在关心机车出场。医生、护士白天黑夜来往各现场，防备发生临时事故，警卫队的战士们警卫时间完了，自动地跑到机车、机械等场帮助搬运机件，在全厂职工这样紧张的工作下，终于超额完成上级所给予的任务。
