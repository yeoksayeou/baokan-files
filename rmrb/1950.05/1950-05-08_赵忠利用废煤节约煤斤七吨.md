　　Zhao Zhong Saves Seven Tons of Coal by Using Waste Coal

    On Labor Day, people thought of Zhao Zhong. Zhao Zhong is a worker at the China Pottery Company. Last winter, he saved seven tons of coal while firing the boiler. Seven tons of coal may not seem like much, but Zhao's sense of ownership, his work ethic, and the experience he gained in his work are worth learning from.

    The company's total coal consumption in previous winters was 49 tons (November to March). Last winter, the company only bought 30 tons of slack coal, plus 6 tons of lump coal in stock and 9 tons of waste coal left by the enemy, for a total of 45 tons. The quality of the waste coal was outdated, with a high soil content, making it difficult to burn and easily clumping together. Zhao patiently picked out the stones from the waste coal, and planned to mix it evenly with the new coal. Every morning at five o'clock, he got up to tend the fire, first burning the large lump coal to create a good fire base. After the indoor temperature was adjusted, he mixed the slack coal with a small amount of water and layered it onto the fire, maintaining the indoor temperature and saving coal at the same time. Half an hour before leaving work in the afternoon, he started sealing the fire with a mixture of new and old slack coal. Throughout the winter, the indoor temperature remained warm as spring.

    Last winter, Zhao was always seen squatting next to the boiler, a pipe in his mouth, his eyes fixed on the fire. He constantly checked whether the coal in the furnace was burning thoroughly and whether there was coal slag in the ash, and he also constantly ran up to the second and third floors to check the heating pipes. Over the winter, Zhao used eight tons of waste coal, leaving one ton of lump coal and two tons of new and old coal, burning a total of forty-two tons, saving seven tons. As a result, he was praised by the workers' group and the administration.

### 赵忠利用废煤节约煤斤七吨

　　赵忠利用废煤节约煤斤七吨
    劳动节那天，人们都想起赵忠来。赵忠是华窑公司的工友，去年冬天烧锅炉，节省了煤斤七吨。七吨煤说起来不算多，可是老赵的主人翁思想，劳动态度和他在工作中取得的经验，是值得人们学习的。
    公司历年冬季用煤总量是四九吨（十一月至三月），去年冬天公司只买了开末煤三○吨，另外有原存块煤六吨，和敌人残遗下来的废煤九吨，一共四五吨。废煤的品质已过时，含土量很多，烧不起火来，还容易炼成大团。赵忠很耐心的把废煤的石头挑出来，有计划的跟新煤调匀到一起，每天早晨五点钟，他就起来挑火，先烧大块煤，把火底打好等到室内的气温调和以后，他就将末煤拌上少量水，一层层往火上扑上去，一面保持了室内的温度一面也节省了煤。下午下班以前半点钟，他就开始用新旧煤末封上火，一冬天，室内的气温，永远是温暖如春。
    去年一冬天，什么时候都看见老赵蹲在锅炉旁边，嘴里衔着个烟袋，两个眼睛盯着炉火。他经常注意炉中的煤是否烧透，下来的炉灰是否有煤渣，还不断的跑上二三楼去检查暖气管子。这样一冬天下来，老赵利用了废煤八吨，剩下块煤一吨，新旧煤二吨，统共烧了四二吨，节省了七吨。因此受到了工人小组以及行政上的表扬。
