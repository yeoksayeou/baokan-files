　　Normal University Students and Staff Organize Handicraft Production
　　[This Newspaper News] The handicraft production of students and staff at Normal University has begun. It is divided into two parts: sewing and fine arts. The sewing section has three stages: learning, practice, and production, carried out under the principle of not hindering studies and work, with more than 200 participants. They began learning cutting and using sewing machines in late April. After two weeks, they can try to make baby clothes for the kindergarten within the university and some adult clothes. In the future, they plan to undertake sewing work within the university and external work. They also plan to weave straw hats in the summer. The fine arts department is participated in by all fine arts students. Many finished products have been produced, such as car lights, small stools, foreign locks, lighting lamps, and cardboard and wooden toys, wooden furniture, tables, stools, and bookshelves. They are awaiting the production committee to sign off on the sale. At the same time, the fine arts department plans to increase other production, such as: (1) Forging, which can produce flower shovels, flower hoes, sickles, etc.; (2) Dyeing, which can produce handkerchiefs, schoolbags, pillowcases, bed sheets, etc.; (3) Woodworking, which can produce folding stools, etc. (It is planned to first make some samples and send them to various agencies to solicit orders); (4) Trial production of bronze statues of Chairman Mao and slides, etc.
