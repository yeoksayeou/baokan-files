Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 19th: The Red May production competition launched in some factories in Shanghai has significantly improved various production efficiencies. The steel output of the No. 1 Steel Plant of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company has completed 42% of the monthly target in the first eight days of the month. During the same period, the rolling output of the No. 2 Plant also completed 40% of the monthly target. The No. 3 Plant completed 43% of the monthly steelmaking and steel casting tasks in the first nine days of the month. Since the No. 1 Plant of the China Textile Construction Company started the competition to eliminate substandard cloth on May 1st, the substandard cloth rate in the first week of this month has dropped from 6.14% in April to 2.98%, and defective cloth has also decreased by one-third.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 15th: The Tianjin mass production competition movement, which started this month, has been launched in more than 40 factories in 12 state-owned enterprises, including China Textile Company, Public Utilities Bureau, and Electricity Bureau. Some factories have achieved preliminary results. For example, in the yarn workshop of China Textile No. 1 Plant, the rate of returned cotton waste has decreased sharply since the competition began. In the second workshop, the returned cotton waste from the combing and spinning frames of Class A has dropped from an average of 2.5 pounds per machine per day before the competition to 0.95 pounds. The returned cotton waste from the opening and cleaning machines and carding machines has dropped from 1,400 pounds per day to 180 pounds. The waste of wire rods in the rolling mill of the steel plant has dropped from 4% before the competition to 1.5%, and the daily output of the lead plating section of the wire factory has increased from 3 tons to 4 tons. The daily output of the tannery has increased by 10% compared to the planned output. This movement is now expanding from direct producers to indirect producers, and from workers to staff. For example, the field personnel of the Electricity Bureau who inspect electricity users used to inspect a maximum of 210 households per person per day, but now many people inspect 240 households per day. Non-direct production cadres and staff in various offices of China Textile No. 1 Plant have also begun to discuss and formulate their own work competition plans.

　　沪津展开红五月生产竞赛
    若干工厂生产效率已显著提高
    【新华社上海十九日电】上海部分工厂中开展的红五月生产竞赛，已显著地提高了各种生产效率。上海钢铁公司第一厂的炼钢产量，在月初八天中已完成本月规定任务的百分之四十二；同一时期，第二厂轧钢产量，亦完成了本月任务的百分之四十；第三厂则在月初九天中完成了本月炼钢及铸钢任务的百分之四十三；中国纺织建设公司第一厂从“五一”开始消灭次布的竞赛后，本月第一周的次布率已由四月份的百分之六点一四降到百分之二点九八，坏布亦减少了三分之一。
    【新华社天津十五日电】从本月开始的天津市大生产竞赛运动，已在中纺公司、公用局、电业局等十二个公营企业单位四十余厂中展开，其中部分工厂已获初步成绩。如中纺一厂纱场，自展开竞赛后，回花率急剧减少；二场甲班并条、细纱的回花由竞赛前每日每台车平均出二·五磅降至○·九五磅，清花、钢丝的回花由每天一千四百磅降至一百八十磅。制钢厂轧钢场的盘条废品由竞赛前百分之四降低到百分之一·五，铁丝厂铅镀部的日产量由三吨增至四吨。制革厂日产量已较计划产量提高了百分之十等。现这一运动正从直接生产者扩大到间接生产者，从工人扩大到职员。如电业局检查用电户的外勤人员，过去每人一天最多检查二百一十户，现许多人已日查二百四十户；中纺一厂中的非直接生产干部及各室职员，也开始讨论与制定自己的工作竞赛计划。
