Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th. The people along the Dongjiang, Xijiang, Beijiang, and Hanjiang rivers in Guangdong Province, under the leadership of the People's Government, have achieved significant success in their struggle against the spring floods and are currently stepping up their efforts to prepare for the summer flood season.

During the Kuomintang's rule, the dikes and embankments of the province's rivers were in disrepair for many years, and severe floods occurred every year from 1947 to 1949. After the liberation of the entire province, in January of this year, the Provincial People's Government led the people along the rivers to carry out flood prevention and dike restoration work. By mid-April, more than 80% of the main dike restoration and breach sealing projects on the rivers had been completed.

However, the flood season for each river came earlier than in previous years this year. From late April to mid-May, due to continuous heavy rains, the rivers swelled, and in some places even exceeded the highest water levels of last year, placing many dikes and embankments in danger. The people along the rivers immediately and urgently engaged in flood prevention and rescue, fighting against the spring floods. For example, the breach sealing project at Fengle Embankment in Xijiang was still short of over 40,000 cubic meters of earthwork when the flood arrived. At that time, the water level was only 45 centimeters away from the lowest dike surface, a very dangerous situation. The Xijiang Special Administrative Office immediately mobilized more than 10,000 laborers and over 20 engineering personnel to work hard to repair the embankment, and finally overcame the danger, saving 150,000 mu of paddy fields from flooding. During the spring floods, more than 20 larger dangerous dikes such as the Dongxi Embankment in Shunde, the Yongfeng Embankment in Sanshui, and the Lingxiao Embankment in Gaoming were all successfully rescued through the joint efforts of the government and the people. During last year's flood season in Sanshui County, more than 40 of the county's 62 dikes and embankments collapsed; this year, thanks to the strong leadership of the responsible cadres of the county, who personally led more than 40,000 laborers to repair the dikes and complete the restoration and breach sealing projects early, the county has safely passed the spring flood season, thus saving more than 300,000 mu of paddy fields from flooding.

In the struggle against the spring floods, there were also individual county leaders who did not pay enough attention to the flood prevention and spring repair work, and even handed over this work to the old embankment party associations still controlled by landlords and local bullies, which delayed the projects, resulting in dike collapses, seepage, and flood overflows when the spring floods arrived. Xin Hui County flooded more than 83,000 mu of land, and some sub-dikes collapsed in Sihui, Gaoming, Huiyang, Dongguan, and Heshan counties.

In order to correct the shortcomings of the above-mentioned local leading organs and prevent the upcoming summer floods, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government has recently announced emergency instructions and measures regarding flood prevention and rescue. According to this instruction, the special districts and county people's governments along the rivers have successively established flood prevention headquarters, and are now organizing rescue teams and stepping up the deployment of various flood prevention tasks.

### 广东人民战胜春汛  现正紧急布置夏防

　　广东人民战胜春汛
    现正紧急布置夏防
    【新华社广州二十七日电】广东省东江、西江、北江及韩江等河流沿岸人民，在人民政府领导下，在与春汛进行斗争中已获得显著成绩，目前正加紧布置预防夏汛的工作。
    国民党统治时期，全省各江堤围年久失修，自一九四七年至一九四九年每年都发生了严重的水灾。全省解放后，今年一月间，省人民政府即领导沿江人民进行防洪复堤工作。至四月中旬，各江主要干堤的修复堵口等工程，业已完成百分之八十以上。
    但今年各江涨水期均较往年提早，从四月下旬到五月中旬，因连日大雨，各江暴涨，有的地方并超过去年最高水位，多处堤围陷于危急。沿江人民立即紧张地投入了防洪抢险，与春汛搏斗。如西江丰乐围堵口工程，洪汛到来时，工程尚差四万余土方。当时水位距离最低堤面仅四十五公分，情况非常危险。西江专署立即动员万余民工及工程人员二十余人奋力抢修，终于度过险期，使十五万亩稻田得免水灾。春汛中，顺德之东西围、三水之永丰围，高明之凌霄围等较大险堤二十余处，都在政府与人民共同努力下相继脱险。三水县在去年汛期中，全县六十二处堤围崩决了四十多处；今年则由于该县负责干部的大力领导，亲自带领四万余民工抢修，及早完成了修复堵口等工程，已平安度过春汛，三十余万亩稻田因此免遭水灾。
    在春汛斗争中也有个别县份的领导人员对防洪春修工作重视不够，竟将这一工作交给仍由地主恶霸把持的旧围党会负责，以致延误工程，在春汛到时发生堤围崩塌、渗漏和洪水溢堤等情形。新会县即淹田八万三千余亩，四会、高明、惠阳、东莞、鹤山数县亦有个别子堤崩塌。
    为着纠正上述地方领导机关的工作缺点和预防即将到来的夏汛，广东省人民政府近已公布关于防汛抢险的紧急指示与办法。根据这个指示，沿江各专区及县人民政府都先后成立了防汛指挥部，现正组织抢险队，加紧部署各项防汛工作。
