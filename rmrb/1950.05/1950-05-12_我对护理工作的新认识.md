　　My New Understanding of Nursing Work
　　Peking University Hospital, Liu Yu-fu
　　Today is Nurse's Day, the most pleasant and exciting day for us nurses. In the past, due to the influence of the old social system, we only celebrated our own festival and had fun, and never thought about the shortcomings existing in our work from practical actions. It was even more impossible to establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly.

　　In the past, there were many mistakes in our work, especially the strong idea of benevolence and the concept of employment, which were completely based on personal interests. We never did more than our responsibilities, but stood by and watched, feeling very sacred and aloof. We treated patients solemnly and fearfully, not knowing how to sympathize with patients and solve their pain. Moreover, among colleagues, there was intrigue, mutual suppression, jealousy, and lack of unity, which led to a lack of enthusiasm and responsibility for work. Ideologically, we didn't think about doing a good job (even if we wanted to, it was for our own benefit). Therefore, we always adopted the attitude of seeking no fault but not seeking merit, and perfunctorily dealt with things. After liberation, due to political study and the leadership of the Party, and after consciously launching criticism and self-criticism, I realized that I must transform my ideological errors, eliminate the past shortcomings, strengthen my care for patients in nursing work, strive to improve my skills, not be afraid of hardship or dirt, be more patient and careful, so that patients can recover as soon as possible and participate in production. This is the role that nurses should play in revolutionary work, because only serving the working people is the most glorious.

　　我对护理工作的新认识
    北大医院　刘玉馥
    今天是护士节，是我们护士工作者最愉快最兴奋的日子。在过去由于旧社会制度的影响，我们只不过是为了庆祝自己的节日欢乐一场，而从不曾从实际行动中，想到工作上存在着的一些缺点。更谈不到怎样建立起全心全意为人民服务的思想了。
    以前工作上是存在着很多的错误的，尤其是浓厚的恩慈思想以及雇佣观点，完全是从个人的利害出发的，对于责任以外的事，从来不肯多做，反而袖手旁观，觉得自己非常神圣，高高在上。对待病人庄严可畏，不知道怎样的同情病人，解决病人的痛苦，而且在同事之间，更是勾心斗角，互相倾轧，嫉妒，不团结，以致产生了对于工作的不积极，不负责任的现象。思想上也没有想把工作搞好（即使想好的话也是为了自己）。因此总是抱着只求无过不求有功的态度，敷衍了事。这些缺点在解放后由于政治的学习，党的领导，自觉的展开了批评与自我批评以后，我认识到必须改造自己思想上的错误，消除过去的缺点，在护理工作上加强对病人的关心，努力提高技术，不怕苦，不怕脏，多忍耐，多细心，使病人早日痊愈，参加生产，这才是护士在革命工作中应起的作用，因为只有为劳动人民服务才是最光荣的。
