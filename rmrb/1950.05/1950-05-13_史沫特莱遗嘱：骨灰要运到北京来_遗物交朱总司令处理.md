Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 12th—The remains of the famous American writer and journalist Agnes Smedley, who passed away in Oxford, England, were cremated in Oxford on the 10th. In her will, Smedley stated that all her belongings should be sent to Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, for disposal, and her ashes should be transported to Beijing.

Craig, representing the Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association, said in his speech at the funeral that Smedley died after undergoing surgery for stomach cancer. Her death was hastened by the persecution she and her friends had suffered and were suffering from American fascism.

It is also learned that the American Democratic Far East Policy Committee issued an obituary for Smedley's death, saying: Smedley taught an entire generation of Americans to support China's struggle for freedom, and they are deeply saddened to hear of her death. We will continue to fight for peace and freedom for all peoples.
