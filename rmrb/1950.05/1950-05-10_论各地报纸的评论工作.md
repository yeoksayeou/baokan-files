After a comprehensive survey and study of twenty-seven local newspapers across the country from February, March up to April 10th, we believe that the current commentary work of newspapers is weak. Except for a few newspapers that attach importance to commentary, the commentary of most newspapers is not regular. Among the twenty-seven newspapers we read, eighteen published fewer commentaries than half the number of issues from March 1st to April 10th. Therefore, strengthening commentary work is an important task for newspapers nationwide.

The weakness of newspaper commentary work has led to many local events being lightly passed over. For example, among the fifteen commentaries published by Dazhong Daily of Shandong from March 1st to April 10th, only one was a short commentary on industrial production. During the same period, the masses Daily of Xi'an did not comment on the extremely important ethnic issues in Northwest China. Zhejiang Daily had only two editorials in March, one commemorating the March 8th Women's Day and one celebrating the closing of the Farmers' Representative Conference, while there was no commentary on other important events that occurred in Zhejiang in March. Among the commentaries published in the twenty-seven newspapers, there was a general emphasis on commentaries on farmer issues, and even city newspapers rarely commented on urban issues.

The general explanation for the weakness of commentary work is the lack of cultivated writing cadres. In fact, even with sufficient writing cadres, if these cadres are not combined with local practical work departments and are not familiar with the actual work situation, it is impossible to have commentaries that solve problems and guide practical work. Therefore, important commentaries must rely on the participation of responsible persons from the People's Government and the Communist Party to write. In this regard, the work of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee is worth introducing. Since January of this year, the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau has convened a Party Newspaper Committee every month. The attendees of this meeting include: the Minister of Industry, the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Commerce, the Minister of Finance, the President of the Bank, the Director of the Railway Bureau, responsible personnel from cultural and educational institutions, the Minister of Organization and the Secretary-General of the Northeast Bureau, as well as responsible comrades from various people's organizations. Before the meeting, the newspaper first understands the work plans and work situation of each department, and formulates a monthly reporting plan and commentary plan based on this. The plan is then submitted for discussion at the meeting, and the responsible persons of each department present are jointly responsible for completing it. As a result of the decisions of this meeting, the heads of many important work departments in the Northeast wrote editorials for the Northeast Daily.

Generally speaking, the commentary work of the Northeast Daily is relatively successful in terms of both quantity and quality. Taking the editorials and short commentaries published by the newspaper from April 1st to 10th as an example, they included the following topics: "Fight Against All Acts of Destroying Public Property" (April 2nd short commentary), "Oppose Undemocratic and Bureaucratic Work Style in Enterprise Management" (April 3rd short commentary), "Continue the Efforts and Advance Victoriously" (April 4th editorial, commenting on the achievements of Northeast economic construction last year and this year's plan), "Rather Less, But Better" (April 4th short commentary, commenting on the exchange of labor and mutual assistance in rural areas), "Overcome Formalism in Security Inspection" (April 6th short commentary), "How to Implement Economic Accounting System" (April 7th editorial), "The Lessons of the Demolition of Houses in the 24th Factory" (April 8th editorial), "Indiscriminate Issuance of Investigation Forms is also a Kind of Bureaucracy" (April 9th short commentary), "Protecting Draft Animals and Breeding Draft Animals" (April 10th editorial). These commentaries played a specific guiding role in practical work.

Newspapers in other places have also adopted the same methods as the Northeast Daily to organize commentary work. The "Instructions on Strengthening the Editorial and Communication Work of Henan Daily" issued by the Propaganda Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC on February 3rd, after reviewing that Henan Daily "is not regular and systematic in the writing of editorials," made the following decisions: "A. Establish an editorial committee of Henan Daily... and continue to hire special editorial writers as needed for work. B. Propaganda departments of various district and municipal committees organize editorial research groups to write special articles and contributions according to the needs of guiding the work and struggle in their respective regions." These decisions are very good. However, the Propaganda Department of the Henan Provincial Committee and Henan Daily did not implement these decisions as effectively as the Northeast Daily, so the commentary work of Henan Daily is still "irregular."

Here, on the one hand, the important key lies in the leadership of the local Party committee and the People's Government. Of course, the leading comrades of the Party committees or administrative departments in every place should always remember the instructions of Lenin, Stalin, and the CPC Central Committee on Party newspapers, and understand how to use newspapers to guide practical work. However, this does not mean that the newspaper can therefore adopt a passive waiting attitude and not make all the necessary efforts on its own. Therefore, on the other hand, the important key also lies in the newspaper workers themselves. Newspaper workers must use their effective work to win the help of the leading comrades of the Party committee and the People's Government for the newspaper.

In addition, the newspaper editorial department must still use its own strength to write daily commentaries. Newspapers should regularly express their opinions to readers on the most meaningful news published in the newspaper that day. If you cannot write a long editorial, you should write it as a short commentary, which can and should be present on every page. Replies in the newspaper mailbox are also a powerful form of commentary. Adding editorial notes before and after news and other manuscripts is also a kind of commentary in practice. Hebei Daily often adds editor's notes to news, and Heilongjiang Daily often has "Editor's Words" after news. These notes are of course easier to write than formal commentaries, and are often more flexible and lively than formal commentaries. With enough editorials, short commentaries, replies to readers' letters, and editorial notes in the newspaper, the newspaper becomes vocal and lively, and readers feel intimate and guided when reading the newspaper.

Commentary is the banner of the newspaper. Without commentary, the newspaper will lose or reduce its leadership significance to the masses. However, this does not mean that we can allow empty and forced commentaries. Our commentaries should be realistic, politically meaningful, and indispensable for practical work. Nonsense is our enemy, and we must oppose nonsense appearing in our newspapers.

### 论各地报纸的评论工作

专栏：报纸述评

　　论各地报纸的评论工作
    把二月份、三月份直至四月十日以前的全国各地二十七种报纸作了一次概括的调查研究以后，我们认为目前报纸的评论工作是贫弱的。除了少数几种重视评论的报纸以外，多数报纸的评论是不经常的。在我们所读过的二十七种报纸中，从三月一日到四月十日发表评论篇数不及刊期之半的有十八种。因此加强评论工作是全国报纸的一项重要的任务。
    报纸评论工作的贫弱，曾经使得许多关系到本地的事件被轻轻放过了。例如山东大众日报在三月一日至四月十日的十五篇评论中，有关工业生产的只有一篇短评。西安群众日报在同一时期中对西北当地极为重要的民族问题没有评论。浙江日报在三月份只有两篇社论，一篇是纪念三八节的，一篇是庆祝农民代表大会闭幕的，而对三月份发生在浙江的其他重要事件没有评论。在二十七种报纸所发表的评论中，普遍地侧重了农民问题的评论，对于城市问题，城市报纸也很少评论。
    评论工作的贫弱，一般的解释是缺乏有修养的写作干部。实际上，即使有了足够的写作干部，如果这些干部不与当地实际工作部门相结合，不熟悉实际工作情况，也不可能有解决问题和指导实际工作的评论。因此，重要的评论不能不依靠人民政府和共产党的负责人来参加写作。在这一方面，中共中央东北局的工作是值得介绍的。东北局宣传部从今年一月起每月召集一次党报委员会，出席这个会议的有：工业部部长、农业部部长、商业部部长、财政部部长、银行行长、铁路局局长、文教机关负责人员、东北局的组织部长和秘书长以及各人民团体负责同志等。在举行会议以前，报社先后各部门了解他们的工作计划和工作情况，据以制定一个月的报道计划和评论计划，在会议中提出讨论，并由到会各部门负责人共同担任完成的责任。由于这个会议的决定，东北许多重要工作部门的负责人都为东北日报写了社论。
    一般地说，东北日报的评论工作在量上和质上都是比较成功的。试举四月一日至十日该报所发表的社论短评为例，其中包括了这样的题目：《向一切破坏公共房产行为作斗争》（二日短评），《反对企业管理中的不民主与官僚主义作风》（三日短评），《再接再厉胜利前进》（四日社论，评东北经济建设去年的成绩和今年的计划），《宁肯少些，但要好些》（四日短评，评农村中的换工互助），《克服保安检查中的形式主义（六日短评），《如何贯彻经济核算制》（七日社论），《廿四厂拆毁房屋事件的教训》（八日社论），《滥发调查表格也是一种官僚主义》（九日短评），《保护耕畜，繁殖耕畜》（十日社论）。这些评论在实际工作中起了具体的指导作用。
    旁的地方的报纸也有采用与东北日报相同的办法来组织评论工作的。河南日报在二月三日发表的中共河南省委宣传部“关于加强河南日报言论通讯工作的指示”，在检讨河南日报“在言论的撰述上，表现为不经常、不系统”以后，作出了如次的决定：“甲、组设河南日报社论委员会……并得因工作需要，继续聘请特约言论撰述人。乙、各地委、市委宣传部组织言论研究小组，各就本区工作斗争的指导需要，撰述专论、来论”。这些决定是很好的。但是，河南省委宣传部和河南日报对于贯彻这些决定，就没有像东北日报有效，因而河南日报的评论工作仍旧是“不经常”的。
    在这里，从一方面说，重要的关键是在当地党委和人民政府的领导。当然，每一个地方的党委或行政部门领导同志应当时时刻刻记得列宁、斯大林和中共中央对于党报的指示，懂得运用报纸来指导实际工作。但是，这决不是说报纸因此就可以采取消极等待的态度，自己不作一切应有的努力。所以，从另一方面说，重要的关键同样也在报纸工作者身上。报纸工作者必须用自己的有效的工作，来争取党委和人民政府领导同志对于报纸的帮助。
    此外，报纸编辑部仍然必须用自己的力量写作日常的评论。报纸应当经常针对当天报纸上所发表的对当地最有意义的新闻，向读者表示自己的意见。不能写长篇社论的题目，应当写成短评，这是各个版面都可以有，都应当有的。报纸信箱中的答复，同样是评论的一种有力的形式。在新闻和其他稿件的前后加上编辑部的按语，实际上也是一种评论。河北日报经常在新闻中加上编者按语，黑龙江日报也经常在新闻后面有“编报人的话”。这种按语当然比正式的评论容易写作，而且常常比正式的评论更为灵活生动。报纸上有了足够的社论、短评、读者来信的答复和编辑部的按语，就使报纸变成有声音和有生气了，就使读者在读报时感觉亲切和有指导了。
    评论是报纸的旗帜。没有评论，就会失去或减少报纸对群众的领导意义。但是，这决不是说我们可以容许空洞的硬凑的评论。我们的评论应当是实事求是的，有政治内容的，为实际工作所不可少的。废话是我们的敌人，我们必须反对废话出现在我们的报纸上。
