　　[Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, May 13th] The Fourth Field Army Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army has recently released a communiqué on the victory of the Hainan Island campaign, stating:

　　A portion of our army, under the direct coordination of the Qiongya Column and with the strong support of the people in the Central South region, especially the people of Guangdong, launched an operation to eliminate the remnant bandits in Qiongya through a combination of covert crossings and large-scale amphibious landings. Within half a month (from April 17th, when our army launched a large-scale landing in northern Qiong, to April 30th, when Beili Port was liberated), we rapidly crushed all enemy resistance and completely liberated Hainan Island. The myth of the Kuomintang remnant bandits, relying on US aid and attempting to occupy the islands for stubborn resistance, boasting about their so-called "three-dimensional sea, land, and air defense" and "Hainan defense line as solid as a rock," quickly vanished. In this operation, aside from a portion of the remnant bandits who escaped by sea, over 30,000 were annihilated on the island. This significant blow shattered the strategic deployment of the remnant bandits attempting to use Taiwan, Zhoushan, Kinmen, and Hainan as mutually supporting strongholds to resist from the islands. This has also prepared favorable conditions for our army's future operations to liberate Taiwan, Zhoushan, and Kinmen.

　　The statistics of the battle results are as follows: (1) Annihilated 31,985 enemy personnel. Among them, 5,416 officers and soldiers, including the wounded Commander of the Second Fleet Wang Enhua (wounded), Chief of Staff of the 62nd Army Wen Hong (killed), and regimental adjunct of the 852nd Regiment Qu Zhongliu and below, were killed or wounded; 23,885 officers and soldiers, including the captured Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander of the 62nd Army Luo Maoxun, Deputy Division Commander of the 286th Division of the Fourth Army Qiu Guoliang, Major General and Deputy Division Commander of the 153rd Division of the 62nd Army Zhang Dijiang, Major General and Deputy Division Commander of the 163rd Division of the 62nd Army Xing Zhuoru, and Major General and Deputy Commander of the 3rd Hainan Police Security Division Han Peng and below, were captured; 1,684 officers and soldiers, including the commander of the 489th Regiment of the 163rd Division of the 62nd Army Li Yirong and Deputy Regiment Commander Luo Rongbin and below, surrendered. In addition, over a thousand enemies were drowned.

　　(2) Seized: 12,335 rifles, 372 pistols, 424 submachine guns, 397 automatic rifles, 1,256 carbines, 969 light machine guns, 228 heavy machine guns, 11 anti-aircraft machine guns; 168 60mm mortars, 52 grenade launchers, 56 rifle grenade launchers, 90 mortars, 17 infantry guns, 6 mountain guns, 7 field guns, 1 rapid-fire gun, 10 anti-tank guns, 4 fortress guns, 7 anti-aircraft guns, 23 rocket launchers, 5 anti-aircraft machine cannons, 1 heavy cannon; 27 radio stations, 4 telephone switchboards, 114 single telephones; 92 war horses; 138 vehicles, 3 armored vehicles, 4 tanks; 1 small steamer; 1,166,098 rounds of various bullets, 3,413 rounds of various shells, 7,170 hand grenades.
