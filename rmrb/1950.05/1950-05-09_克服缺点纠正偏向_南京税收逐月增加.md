　　Overcoming Shortcomings and Correcting Deviations
　　Nanjing's Tax Revenue Increases Month by Month
　　[Nanjing News] Since the Nanjing Municipal Taxation Bureau strengthened the rectification of tax collection work and improved work efficiency after conducting inspections of various sub-bureaus and tax offices in late March, tax revenue has been increasing daily.

　　After conducting business inspections of the sub-bureaus, the bureau discovered the following problems: (1) Too few field staff and too many office staff, and improper allocation of field personnel; (2) Staff members have serious paralysis and complacency, and are content with the status quo; (3) Field personnel are afraid of trouble, their work is not thorough, so that no problems have been found in the three months from January of this year, and they believe that merchants have no tax evasion; the decline in tax revenue figures is regarded as an inevitable phenomenon of the off-season; (4) There are "benevolent governance" views and ideas that belittle tax work; (5) The sub-bureau leaders do not arrange, study, or inspect the work, and let things go, committing serious bureaucratic style. After criticism and inspection, it was decided that each office staff member must have a quantitative work quota, and the field staff must find problems, laying the foundation for the fixed-personnel fixed-quota system. In April, each sub-bureau held a general meeting of all cadres to carry out criticism and self-criticism to improve the work. After reviewing its work, the Zhongshan East Road Sub-bureau began to improve the relationship between leaders and cadres, and did a good job in party-mass unity. Everyone further developed their enthusiasm, and the work situation greatly improved, and tax revenue increased daily. Since the joint general survey of business tax and stamp tax began on March 27, a large number of tax evasion cases have been discovered, with 281 cases in stamp tax and 52 cases in business tax; the highest amount of tax evasion reached 5,781,786 yuan, and the lowest was 1,963,300 yuan. In terms of goods tax: 17 cases of untaxed goods were discovered. The leaders and cadres of the sub-bureau realized the seriousness of merchants' tax evasion, thereby breaking the paralysis of the off-season in spring and the idea that merchants had no tax evasion, and establishing the confidence that they could complete and definitely exceed the task. The daily income of the sub-bureau's business tax used to be between 1 million and 2 million yuan, and now it has reached between 3 million and 4 million yuan per day, exceeding the highest record since the establishment of the sub-bureau. The total income of the sub-bureau was over 400 million yuan in January, 680 million yuan in February, and 1.029 billion yuan in March. From the 1st to the 19th of April, it reached 1.697 billion yuan. The Sanpailou Tax Office under the sub-bureau was also able to collect more taxes in March, which is generally considered the off-season, than the highest actual number since its establishment in November, completing 171,787 catties of rice, an increase of more than 85% over February and more than 126% over January. From April 1st to 19th, it has collected more than 310 million yuan (equivalent to about 229,000 catties of rice), exceeding the total monthly tax revenue in March. (Gao Qinghua)

　　克服缺点纠正偏向
    南京税收逐月增加
    【南京讯】南京市税务局为加强整顿税收工作，提高工作效率，自三月下旬经分别对各分局及税所进行检查后，税收即日有增加。
    该局经对分局进行业务检查结果，发现以下一些问题：（一）外勤少、内勤多，且外勤人员分配不当；（二）工作人员存在着严重的麻痹思想，放任松懈满足于现状；（三）外勤人员怕麻烦，工作不深入，以致从今年一月起三个月内都未发现问题，认为商人已无漏税行为；税收数字下降以为是淡季的必然现象；（四）有“仁政”观点与轻视税收工作的思想；（五）分局领导上对工作无布置、不研究、不检查、放任自流，犯了严重的官僚主义作风。经过批判和检查，即确定内勤每人必须有定量的工作，外勤必须发现问题，为定员定额制打下基础。并在四月间各分局分别召集的全体干部会上展开批评与自我批评，改进工作。中山东路分局经检讨后，开始改善了领导与干部的关系，搞好了党群团结，大家进一步发挥了积极性，工作情形于是大有改观，税收日有起色。自三月廿七日开始行商、印花两税联合普查以来，查获漏税案件极多，印花方面达二百八十一件，行商税方面查获五十二件；最高漏税额达五、七八一、七八六元之多，最低亦有一、九六三、三○○元。货物税方面：查获未税案件十七起，该分局的领导和干部由此才认识了商人逃税的严重性，从而打破了春季是淡月及商人已无逃税的麻痹思想，确立了能够完成并且一定超过任务的信心。该分局行商税过去每日收入在一百万至二百万之间，现在每日已达三百万至四百万元，超过该分局成立以来最高纪录。该分局总的收入一月份为四亿余元，二月份为六亿八千万元，三月份为十亿另二千九百万元，四月份自一日至十九日止即达十六亿九千七百万元。该分局所属三牌楼税务所亦能在一般认为是淡季的三月份收税超过自十一月成立以来的最高折实数，完成了一七一、七八七斤大米，比二月份增加百分之八十五强，比一月份增加百分之一百二十六强。四月一日至十九日则已收起了三亿一千余万元（折米约二十二万九千余斤），超过了三月份的全月税收数。（高庆华）
