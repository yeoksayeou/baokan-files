　　Strengthen Learning to Celebrate May Day and May Fourth
　　North China Middle School Conducts Learning Inspection
　　[本报讯] The students of North China Middle School are commemorating the great festivals of "May Day" and "May Fourth" with a general learning inspection. This general learning inspection first examines the purpose of learning. Each class group has already started discussions on: What is the purpose of learning each subject? Why should we study those subjects? What are they useful for to us? This is because many students are not clear enough about the purpose of learning each subject, forming blind learning and feeling no interest. For example, some students say: "My family told me to come to school, so I came to school," or "The Academic Affairs Office scheduled this course, so I have to study it." Now, it is stipulated that each group should discuss the purpose of learning and submit the results to the subject representative, who will forward them to the subject teacher for correction. The second is to check the learning attitude. This includes homework, listening to lectures, self-study, and attitude towards teachers and students, such as whether homework is submitted on time? Is it neat and clean? Is there any plagiarism? Are the assigned homework reviewed and saved? Can you concentrate and listen attentively in class? If you don't understand, do you ask immediately? Is the self-study time observed? Are teachers respected? If you are dissatisfied with the teaching method, can you make specific suggestions? Can you develop the spirit of "unity, mutual assistance, and friendship" towards your classmates, etc.? This inspection also stipulates that opinions should be offered on the teaching methods and grading of each subject teacher.

　　加强学习庆祝五一、五四
    华北中学进行学习检查
    【本报讯】华北中学同学正以学习总检查来纪念“五一”、“五四”这两个伟大的节日。这次学习总检查首先是检查学习目的。已由班上各小组展开讨论：学习各科的目的是什么？为什么要学习那些科目？对我们有什么用处？这是因为很多同学对各科的学习目的还不十分明确，形成盲目学习和感到毫无兴趣。例如有的同学说：“家里叫我来读书我就来读书”，或者是“教导处排了这门功课我不得不学”。现在规定各小组就学习目的进行讨论后将结果汇交科代表，转交该科老师修正。其次是检查学习态度。包括作业、听课、自习以及对老师对同学的态度，比方作业是否按时交卷？是否整齐清洁？有无抄别人的现象？发下的作业是否复习、保存？在上课时能否集中精力静心听讲？如果不懂是否立刻询问？自习时间遵守没有？对老师是否尊敬？如果对教学法感到不满意时是否能具体提出意见？对同学是否能发挥“团结互助友爱”的精神等。此次检查中并规定对各科老师教学法及批卷提出意见。
