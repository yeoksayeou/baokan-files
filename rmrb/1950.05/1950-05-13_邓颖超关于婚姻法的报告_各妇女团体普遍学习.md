　　Deng Yingchao's Report on the Marriage Law
　  Widely Studied by Women's Organizations
    [Our Newspaper] Beijing Municipal Women's organizations have universally launched study and discussion on the report on the Marriage Law given by Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation on April 17th. Members of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese Women's Friendship Association held 20 group discussions. Everyone unanimously supported the new Marriage Law, feeling that the interests of women who have been discriminated against and oppressed for decades have been strongly protected in New China. They are all housewives. In the discussions, they shared their own experiences and recounted the persecution and suffering of feudal marriages they had suffered for the past twenty or thirty years, thereby further recognizing that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can women achieve true liberation. The Peking University Housewives Association also held group discussions, deeply feeling that mutual love and mutual assistance between husband and wife can only be achieved when women eliminate their dependence, participate in labor, gain economic status, and are based on a common political direction and career. The Tsinghua Housewives Association conducted communication and study in eleven groups. They celebrated that the interests of women and children have been legally protected. In order to better carry out propaganda and education work among the masses, the women's work groups in various districts also conducted in-depth study and discussion on Deng Yingchao's report. Some districts have also carried out publicity and explanations in adult night schools and among women.
    [Another Dispatch] Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation has actively launched publicity work. In addition to inviting Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, to give a report last month, it has also listed the publicity work of the Marriage Law as one of the central tasks in May. It is now actively collecting opinions from the masses and preparing to continue organizing lectures in the near future, inviting relevant department heads to give reports.

　　邓颖超关于婚姻法的报告
　  各妇女团体普遍学习
    【本报讯】京市各妇女团体对四月十七日全国民主妇联副主席邓颖超关于婚姻法的报告，普遍展开了学习和讨论。中国妇女联谊会北京分会的会员分组讨论了二十次，大家一致拥护新婚姻法，觉得数十年来受歧视，受压迫的妇女的利益，在新中国得到了有力的保障。她们都是家庭妇女，在讨论中结合了自己的遭遇，诉出了二、三十年来所受封建婚姻的迫害和痛苦，从而进一步认识了只有在共产党的领导下，妇女才能获得真正的解放。北大家庭妇女会也开了小组讨论会，深深感到夫妻间的互爱互助，只有妇女铲除了依赖思想，参加劳动，有了经济地位，在共同的政治方向和事业的基础上才能谈到真正的平等。清华家庭妇女会在十一个小组里进行了传达和学习，她们为妇女和子女的利益得到合法的保障而庆贺。各区妇女工作组为了更好的向群众展开宣传教育工作，对邓颖超的报告也作了深入的学习和讨论。有的区并已在成人夜校和妇女群众当中进行了宣传和解释。
    【又讯】北京市民主妇女联合会自中华人民共和国婚姻法公布后，即积极展开宣传工作，除上月请全国民主妇联副主席邓颖超作了报告外，并把婚姻法的宣传工作列为五月份中心工作之一。现正积极搜集群众的意见准备在最近继续组织讲演会，邀请有关部门负责人作报告。
