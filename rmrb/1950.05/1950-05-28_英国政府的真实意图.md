　　The British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Bevin, made an extremely unfriendly speech towards China during the debate in the British House of Commons on the 24th regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Britain, even saying that establishing diplomatic relations with our country was an "unpleasant decision." This fully exposed the British government's real intentions regarding the establishment of Sino-British diplomatic relations, and it was another unfriendly gesture towards China. This is completely inconsistent with the spirit expressed by the British government on January 6, which stated its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with us on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty.
　　For the past five months, during the negotiations between the British government and our Central People's Government on the establishment of diplomatic relations, on the one hand, it expressed its desire to establish diplomatic relations between China and Britain, and on the other hand, after expressing this desire, it repeatedly demonstrated an unfriendly attitude towards our country in practice. For example, for five months it consistently abstained from voting on the issue of Chinese representation in all United Nations agencies; and with regard to the aircraft in Hong Kong, directly held by the China and Central Aviation Companies under the Civil Aviation Administration of our Central People's Government, the British authorities in Hong Kong have not only obstructed their takeoff and return to the country in various ways, but also have not genuinely taken responsibility for their protection, causing seven of them to be damaged. Regarding the above two issues, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government issued a statement on May 22, believing that the British government should further clarify this inconsistent behavior, that is, it must break off relations with the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits. However, in his speech in the House of Commons, Bevin not only did not take clarifying steps, but also took the opportunity to slander our great ally, the Soviet Union, attempting to provoke and undermine the solid friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. We can solemnly tell Mr. Bevin: The independent status of the People's Republic of China and the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union are unshakable. If the British government does not quickly clarify its inconsistent attitude, no matter how it "discusses" with US imperialism, no matter how "annoyed and agitated" it is, it will be in vain!

### 英国政府的真实意图

　　英国政府的真实意图
    英国下院于二十四日举行关于中英建立外交问题的辩论时，外相贝文发表了一篇对中国极不友好的谈话，竟至说，与我国建立外交关系，是一件“不惬意的决定”。这一方面充分暴露了英国政府在建立中英邦交问题上的真实意图，另一方面也是对中国又一次不友好的表示。这是与英国政府在一月六日所表示的，愿在平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权的基础上，与我进行建立外交关系的精神完全不符的。
    五个月来，英国政府在与我中央人民政府进行建立外交关系的谈判期中，一方面表示与我建立中英间外交关系的愿望，另一方面在表示此种愿望之后，又在事实上一再表现对我国的不友好态度。如五个月来在联合国一切机构中对中国代表权问题一贯投弃权票；而对现在香港为我中央人民政府民航局所属中国、中央两航空公司所直接保有的飞机，香港英国当局既多方阻难其起飞返国，又不真正负责保护，使其中七架遭受破坏。关于上述两个问题，我中央人民政府外交部发言人，于五月二十二日发表谈话，认为英国政府对这种言行不符的行为，应当进一步予以澄清，即必须与国民党残余匪帮断绝关系。而贝文在下院的发言中，不仅没有采取澄清的步骤，竟乘此诬蔑我伟大的友邦苏联，妄图挑拨与破坏我中苏两国人民的巩固友谊。我们可以正告贝文先生：中华人民共和国的独立地位、中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，都是不能动摇的。英国政府如果不迅速澄清其言行不符的态度，无论和美帝国主义如何“讨论”，无论如何“烦恼与激动”都是徒然的！
