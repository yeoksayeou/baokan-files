[From Our Correspondent in Tong County] To protect millions of mu of farmland in eastern Hebei from flooding and to prevent over a million people from being threatened by floods, the North China Water Conservancy Bureau under the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, after surveying, measuring, and designing in 1949, and with the approval of the Government Administration Council, decided to dredge the lower reaches of the Chaobai River. The first phase of seven projects commenced successively in early April; over 93,800 soldiers and civilian laborers in eastern Hebei are working intensely on flood control. It is estimated that these seven projects will be fully completed before the flood season.

The Chaobai River originates in the southern part of Rehe Province; its old course enters the North Canal through Tong County, Hebei. In 1912, the left bank breached near Lisui Town, diverting the Jian’gan River at Bamiancheng into the Jiyun River. From 1924 to 1925, a sluice gate was built and a new diversion channel was opened in Suzhuang, Shunyi, so that part of the Chaobai River water still flowed into the North Canal. In the great flood of 1939 in North China, the sluice gate was destroyed, and the diversion channel was also silted up. The Chaobai River changed its course downstream at Daguantun, Sanhe County, and entered the Jiyun River through Laogaozhai in Baodi. However, the flow of the Chaobai River is very large. Last year, the maximum flood flow was 5,810 cubic meters per second, while the maximum discharge of the Jiyun River was only 200 cubic meters per second, resulting in the annual overflow and breaching of the Jiyun River. In addition, the terrain around eastern Hebei is low-lying, causing eight counties, including Sanhe, Xianghe, Baodi, Ji County, and Yutian, to suffer from floods year after year. In 1949, due to the overflow and breaching of the Jiyun River, 2,925 villages in the eight counties were affected, with a disaster-stricken population of over 1.3 million, and a flooded area of over 6 million mu, resulting in a total loss of 50,000 jin of corn. Losses due to deaths and injuries of people and animals, collapse of houses, and failure to plant spring wheat due to un-drained water are not included. Among them, Baodi County was the most severely affected, with only one and a half villages not submerged.

To fundamentally eliminate the flood threat of the Chaobai River, it is necessary to build reservoirs upstream to regulate flood flow and to divert and smooth the flow downstream. This is a long-term and arduous project. Currently, only downstream diversion projects can be carried out. The entire project aims to handle a flow of 3,000 cubic meters per second from the Chaobai River, including a total of 28 projects, requiring 135 million jin of grain. Such a large project cannot be completed within one year. This year, to partially solve the flood problem in eastern Hebei, only the first phase of seven projects has been decided.

According to this plan, the flow of the Chaobai River above Suzhuang will be diverted through two flood discharge routes: one is to divert 12% (i.e., 300 cubic meters per second) from the Suzhuang Sluice Gate into the North Canal, and then divert another 27% (i.e., 700 cubic meters per second) from Niumutun into the North Canal. Thus, the flow of the North Canal, together with the 500 cubic meters per second flowing in from the Wenyu River, totals 1,500 cubic meters per second. When it reaches below Tong County, 1,200 cubic meters per second of the North Canal water will be diverted from Tumenlou into the Qinglongwan River and then into the Dongdian and Ditou Qilihai, and then discharged into the sea through the Dongyin River via the Jiyun River; the second flood discharge route is to open a new river channel from Jiaokangzhuang in Xianghe to divert 61% (i.e., 1,600 cubic meters per second), southeast to the east of Heilangkou Village in Baodi into Huangzhuangwa, passing through the Xiaowugong River into Qilihai, and still discharged into the sea slowly through the Dongyin River.

The seven projects this year include: 1. Protection project in the Suzhuang area, with the aim of restricting and protecting the river channel at this location, preventing changes in the course and collapse of the riverbank (next year, the intake and discharge gates will be repaired, and the diversion channel will be dredged, starting flood diversion); 2. Repairing the Jian’gan River dike, enabling it to divert a flow of 3,000 cubic meters per second; 3. Building the Niumutun diversion river mouth, fixing the diverted flow at 700 cubic meters per second; 4. Repairing the Tumenlou discharge sluice gate, so that North Canal water can be diverted into the Qinglongwan River; 5. Excavating the new Chaobai River channel; 6. Excavating the Xiaowugong River; 7. Excavating the Dongyin River.

This year's project is only a part of the entire dredging project of the lower reaches of the Chaobai River. After the completion of the project, although it cannot completely solve the flow of 3,000 cubic meters per second from the Chaobai River, it can alleviate the floods in several counties in eastern Hebei. After the completion of all the projects next year, if the flood flow of the Chaobai River does not exceed 3,000 cubic meters per second, the lives and property of over one million people and six million mu of farmland in eastern Hebei, who have been threatened by the Jiyun River floods for years, can be protected. As for the upstream reservoir project, it is also being further surveyed and measured, striving for early completion.

　　保障京东六百万亩农田免于水患
    冀东九万军民整理潮白河
    第一期七项工程大汛前将可完工
    【本报通县讯】为使京东数百万亩农田免于水患，百余万人民免受水灾威胁，中央人民政府水利部所属华北水利工程局，经过一九四九年的查勘、测量和设计，经政务院批准，决定整理潮白河下游工程。第一期七项工程，已于四月初相继开工；冀东九万三千八百余军工、民工正紧张治水。此七项工程预定大汛前可全部完工。
    潮白河发源于热河省南部；故道由河北通县入北运河。一九一二年在李遂镇附近左堤决口，夺箭杆河于八面城而入蓟运河。一九二四到一九二五年，在顺义苏庄修闸并开辟新引河，使部分潮白河水仍归北运河。一九三九年华北大水，闸被冲毁，引河也被淤塞，潮白河于下游三河县的达官屯改道，由宝坻老高寨入蓟运河。但潮白河流量很大，去年最高洪水流量为五千八百一十秒立方公尺，而蓟运河最大泄水量不过二百秒立方公尺，因此造成蓟运河连年的漫溢溃决。再加京东一带地势低洼，致三河、香河、宝坻、蓟县、玉田等八县连年遭受水灾。一九四九年由于蓟运河的漫溢溃决，该八县受灾村庄达二千九百二十五个，受灾人口一百三十多万人，淹地面积六百多万亩，总计损失农产达五万斤玉米，人畜死伤、房屋倒塌及因积水未泄致未能种上春麦的损失尚不计算在内。其中以宝坻县受灾最为严重，全县只有一个半村庄未被淹没。
    要想根本消除潮白河水患，必须在上游修建水库，节蓄洪水流量，并在下游分洪畅流。这是一件较长期的艰苦的工程。目前只能进行下游分洪的工程。全部工程以解决潮白河三千秒立方公尺流量为目标，共包括二十八项工程，需粮一亿三千五百万斤。这样大的工程，不可能在一年之内完成。今年为了部分解决冀东水患问题，仅决定举办第一期的七项工程。
    按照这个计划，潮白河在苏庄以上的流量，将采取两个泄洪路线分泄：一条是从苏庄分水闸分泄百分之十二（即三百秒立方公尺流量）入北运河，再由牛牧屯分泄百分之二十七（即七百秒立方公尺）也入北运河，如此则北运河流量连同自温榆河流入的五百秒立方公尺，共一千五百秒立方公尺，行至通县以下，再由土门楼将北运河水分泄一千二百秒立方公尺，经青龙湾河入东淀及堤头七里海，然后由东引河经蓟运河入海；第二条泄水路线自香河之焦康庄另开新河道分泄百分之六十一（即一千六百秒立方公尺），东南至宝坻黑狼口村东入黄庄洼，下经小蜈蚣河入七里海，仍由东引河徐徐入海。
    今年举办的七项工程中包括：一、苏庄地区防护工程，目的是约束保护该处河道，防止改道及河岸坍塌（明年再修复进水闸、泄水闸，疏浚引河，开始分洪）；二、培修箭杆河堤防，使能分泄三千秒立方公尺流量；三、修筑牛牧屯引河口门，固定分水流量为七百秒立方公尺；四、修复土门楼泄水闸，使北运河水能由此分泄入青龙湾河；五、开挖潮白河新河道；六、开挖小蜈蚣河；七、开挖东引河。
    今年的工程，只是全部整理潮白河下游工程的一部分。工程完成后，虽不能全部解决潮白河三千秒立方公尺流量，但可以减轻京东数县的水灾。明年全部工程完成后，潮白河洪水流量如不超过三千秒立方公尺时，历年遭受蓟运河水灾威胁的冀东百余万人民的生命财产和六百万亩农田，就可得到保障。至于上游蓄水库工程，亦正进一步查勘、测量，争取早日完成。
