    Punish Those Who Disregard Human Life
    To the Editors:
    After seeing the blacklisted Yao Cixiang's negligence of human life incident in the People's Daily on April 24th, I felt extremely sad and indignant. Comrade Stoker Gao Zhentian's death was regrettable, all due to Yao Cixiang, the slow-acting doctor who disregards human life, who single-handedly buried him. He should bear full responsibility.
    Doctor Yao Cixiang has been serving in the Zhaokuang Mine for more than ten years. I'm afraid he has been negligent of human life in treating sick miners many times! Where is his concept of serving the people? Where is his compassionate heart to cure illnesses and save lives? He must transform himself well, get rid of his past bad habit of treating human life as a joke, so that he can better serve the people. Therefore, I advocate that he should make a public and profound self-criticism, and truly recognize his guilt. And he should also express condolences and repentance to the family of the deceased Gao Zhentian. At the same time, I hope that our People's Government will enforce the law strictly, show the determination to learn from the past mistakes to avoid future ones, and reward and punish clearly, giving the doctor Yao Cixiang, who disregarded human life, the punishment he deserves. Finally, I hope that our People's Government will not only strengthen the professional training of old medical personnel, but more importantly, must actively improve and transform their thinking.

    To the Editors:
    The "People's Garden" "Blacklist" published on April 24th reported that Comrade Gao Zhentian, a train stoker from Kailuan Zhaokuang Mine, fell seriously ill and was taken to the hospital responsible for treating illnesses in the mine. However, the doctor of the hospital, after receiving three phone calls from the nurse, not only did not rush to treat him, but also perfunctorily shirked responsibility. This kind of bureaucratic work style caused a worker to die unnecessarily. I suggest that the People's Government deal with the doctor Yao Cixiang's irresponsible and terrible behavior of treating human life as a joke; and hope that the results of the handling will be published in the newspaper.

### 给玩忽人命者以处分

    给玩忽人命者以处分编辑同志：
    当我看到四月二十四日人民日报黑榜刊载姚慈祥玩忽人命事件后，感到十分悲愤。司炉高振田同志死得可惜，这都是紧病慢大夫草菅人命的姚慈祥所一手葬送的。他应该负完全的责任。
    姚慈祥大夫服务于赵矿十余年，恐怕他对有病的矿工，玩忽人命的事儿，还多着吧！他为人民服务的观点在那里？济病活人的心肠又在那里？他必须好好改造自己，把过去那种拿人命当儿戏的恶劣的作风改掉，才能很好的为人民服务。因此，我主张他应该公开的深刻的来检讨一下，好好认识一下自己的罪过。并且他还应该向不治病故的高振田同志的家属慰问忏悔。同时还希望咱的人民政府执法以绳，拿出惩前毖后的决心，赏罚严明，对玩忽人命的大夫姚慈祥给以应得的处分。最后，并希望我人民政府对旧的医务人员除加强其业务学习外，尤其重要的，必须积极的提高和改造他们的思想。
    山西省行政干校  秦达生编辑同志：
    四月二十四日“人民园地”“黑榜”发表开滦赵矿火车司炉高振田同志得严重急病到负责该矿治疗疾病的医院。但该院医生接到护士三次电话，不但不急速赶来治疗，反而马虎推诿。这种官僚主义作风，使一个工人不应死而死去。我建议人民政府对该院大夫姚慈祥这种视人命为儿戏不负责的恶劣行为，加以处理；并希望在报纸上发表处理结果。
