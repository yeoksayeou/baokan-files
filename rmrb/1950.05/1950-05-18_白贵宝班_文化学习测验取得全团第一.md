　　"Bai Guibao Class" Achieves First Place in Cultural Learning Test for the Entire Regiment
　　Political Department of the Chahar Military Region
　　A certain regiment of the Chahar Military Region recently held a cultural learning test, and the third squad of the machine gun company took first place in the entire regiment. In three months, each member of the squad learned more than 300 characters, and the average test score was above 90. Because squad leader Bai Guibao led the whole squad in cultural learning with good methods, the leadership gave this squad the title of "Bai Guibao Class."
　　The Bai Guibao Class has a total of ten people. Except for Bai Guibao, who is slightly literate, all are illiterate, and some comrades can only recognize twenty characters. When cultural learning began last December, the soldiers in the squad were very happy, but felt that they couldn't remember. In the first few days of learning, the results were not good, and everyone became a little discouraged. Bai Guibao then used his own painful experience of being illiterate to persuade everyone, and encouraged them by saying, "As long as you work hard, you will achieve results." At the same time, he buried himself in studying hard and influenced everyone with his actions. As a result, the whole squad's learning enthusiasm rose again. Soldier Shang Tiancai still lacked confidence in learning, so Bai Guibao mobilized all the comrades in the squad to help him. He prepared paper, pens, and ink for him. Shang Tiancai was moved and also began to study hard. Bai Guibao immediately praised him at the squad meeting. After that, Shang Tiancai became an active member in cultural learning.
　　Bai Guibao's method of leading cultural learning is based on the principles of need and voluntarism, promoting democracy. Whether it is the content, method, or progress of learning, he solicits everyone's opinions and discusses them together. After the discussion, a resolution is made and everyone is required to abide by it. Therefore, everyone executes it happily and seriously, and can speak enthusiastically during discussions. They themselves stipulated: "Teach each other, test each other," and "learn anytime, anywhere."
　　After each cultural teacher lectures, Bai Guibao re-lectures to the whole squad to help everyone understand; and often tests and announces the results within the squad. When comrades in the squad did not have enough paper and pens, Bai Guibao used his savings to buy paper and color pencils for everyone, and handed over his two fountain pens for everyone to use in common, and put forward the slogan "People may be idle, but pens must not be." The comrades thanked the squad leader. Bai Guibao said, "These things were bought with the money I saved after quitting smoking. If everyone can quit smoking, our difficulties with pens and paper can be solved." Everyone agreed to quit smoking to buy pens. Two months later, everyone had a fountain pen, and seven people even had two pens and two notebooks.
　　Now, the Bai Guibao Class conducts its own cultural mini-lessons every day outside of the regular classes, reading "Comrade-in-Arms". Whenever there is spare time, everyone studies together in twos and threes. Sometimes they ask each other about new characters, and sometimes they use writing to replace speaking in the squad to practice new characters and sentences. They also pay attention to learning in the midst of work. For example, when chopping grass, they write new characters on the grass chopping knife; when carrying water for the villagers, they write new characters on the hook of the carrying pole; they recite while working. Guo Mingyuan recites slogans on the wall while on guard duty at night. Li Quan draws characters on the ground while defecating. The whole squad is filled with an atmosphere of learning. Their goal is: to strengthen cultural learning in production, and by the end of the year, everyone will have learned 700 characters.

　　“白贵宝班”  文化学习测验取得全团第一
　　察哈尔军区政治部
    察哈尔军区某团最近举行了一次文化学习测验，机炮连第三班取得全团第一。三个月的工夫，全班每人学了三百多个字，测验的平均成绩都在九十分以上。由于班长白贵宝领导全班文化学习的方法好，领导上特给予这个班以“白贵宝班”的称号。
    白贵宝班一共十个人，除白贵宝略通文字外，全是文盲，其中个别同志能识廿个字。去年十二月开始文化学习时，班里战士大都很高兴，但感到记不住。学习的头几天，成绩不好，大家就有点灰心了。白贵宝便用亲身经历过的不识字的痛苦去说服大家，并鼓励大家说：“只要努力，就会有成绩”。同时自己埋头苦学，用行动影响大家。因此，全班学习情绪又高起来了。战士尚天才对学习仍没有信心，白贵宝便动员全班同志帮助他。给他预备纸、笔和墨水，尚天才受到感动，学习也起劲了。白贵宝又立即在班务会上表扬他。以后，尚天才成了文化学习中的积极分子。
    白贵宝领导文化学习的方法，是根据需要和自愿的原则，发扬民主，不论学习内容、方法和进度，都征求大家意见，共同讨论，讨论后作出决议，让大家遵守。因此，大家执行起来很愉快而认真，讨论时都能热烈发言。他们自己规定：要“互相教，互相考试”、“随时随地学习”。
    每次文化教员讲课后，白贵宝再给全班重讲一次，以帮助大家了解；并常常测验，在班内公布成绩。班内同志纸和笔不够用，白贵宝就把自己的积蓄买下纸和颜色分给大家，又把他的两支钢笔交大家公用，并提出“人闲笔不闲”的口号。同志们感谢班长，白贵宝说：“这些东西是我忌烟后省下的钱买的。大家如能忌了烟，咱们笔和纸的困难就可解决。”大家都同意忌烟买笔。两个月后，每人都有钢笔了，还有七人都有两支笔和两个学习本子。
    现在，白贵宝班，每天都在正课外上本班的文化小课，读《战友》。一有空余时间，大家就三三两两地在一块学习。有时互相问生字，有时在本班用写话的方法代替说话，以练习生字和句子。他们还注意在工作中间学习，例如铡草时把生字写到铡草刀上；给老乡担水时把生字写到扁担的挂钩上；一边工作一边念。郭明元晚上放哨，还念墙上的标语。李全解大便时，还在地上画字。全班充满了学习的空气。他们的目标是：在生产中加强文化学习，到年底，每个人学会七百字。
