Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: TASS, 10th dispatch quoting Dentsu News Agency, Hong Kong: Former Japanese army and navy generals and senior officers of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters and the Imperial Headquarters are now working as civil servants in the Japanese government's "Repatriation Bureau" and are working for MacArthur's staff. The "Repatriation Bureau" is a secret center for restoring the Japanese army, and it is affiliated to the "Repatriation and Support Agency for Overseas Compatriots" of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. The 700 "officials" of the Repatriation Bureau are all former senior officers, and under American instructions, they are engaged in plans to prepare for the restoration of the Japanese army and to transform Japanese industry into a war system.

The director of the "Repatriation Bureau" is Lieutenant General Miyazaki Taiichi, the former director of the Operations Department of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters. His close colleagues and "advisers" are former Vice Chief of Staff Torashiro Kawabe, former Vice Admiral Minoru Maeda, and Generals Kamata Ugaki. Ito, the director of the central administrative office of the "Maritime Safety Agency," who is currently preparing to reorganize the Japanese Navy in accordance with American instructions, is the liaison officer between MacArthur's staff and the "Repatriation Bureau." There is a section in the "Repatriation Bureau" led by Colonel Takushiro Hattori, the former director of a certain section of the Imperial Headquarters. The United States entrusted this section to collect materials on the composition of the former Japanese Army and the strength of the officer corps of the Japanese ground forces. For this purpose, the section obtained all records and materials from the archives of the former Japanese Army, including lists of officers, and received the skilled assistance of American "advisers."

Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: TASS, 11th dispatch quoting Dentsu News Agency, Hong Kong: MacArthur's headquarters has begun to accelerate the conversion of Japanese naval ports. The three ports of Maizuru, Tsuruga, and Sasebo are currently being converted into bases for accommodating large warships. All preliminary work in these three ports has been completed, and bridges are currently being raised to allow large warships to enter. Dry docks and floating docks are under construction. The ports of Ominato and Niigata have also been completely rebuilt to accommodate ships with a displacement of more than 10,000 tons.

The Japanese government must pay for the conversion of Japanese ports. This port conversion project is being carried out according to the plans of American military engineers and under the guidance of experts from MacArthur's headquarters. Due to the American demand for high-speed execution of this project, the cost is extremely high.

　　为侵略战争铺设道路
　　美帝竟起用前日军将领
    并加紧改建舞鹤等地为军港
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社十日电引电通社香港讯：前日本军队陆海军将领们与日本参谋本部及帝国大本营的高级军官，现在已在日本政府的“复员局”里充当文官，并且正为麦克阿瑟参谋部工作。“复员局”是恢复日本军队的秘密中心，它附属于日本政府厚生省的“在外同胞撤退援护厅”。复员局的七百名“官员”都是以前的高级军官，并在美国授意下从事准备恢复日本军队与使日本工业变成战争体制的计划。
    “复员局”局长是前日本参谋本部的作战部部长宫崎太一中将，他的亲近的同僚和“顾问”便是前参谋次长河边虎四郎、前海军中将前田稔以及鎌田鹈垣等将领。现正依照美国训令筹备重整日本海军的“海上保安厅”中央行政公署署长、前海军中将伊藤，便是麦克阿瑟的参谋部与“复员局”之间的联络官。“复员局”中有一个处，便是由前帝国大本营某处处长服部卓四郎大佐所领导的。美国委托这个处来收集关于前日本陆军组成与日本地面部队军官干部实力的材料。为了这一目的，该处得到包括军官名单的前日本陆军档案中的一切记录材料，并得到美国“顾问”的熟练协助。
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社十一日电引电通社香港消息：麦克阿瑟总部已开始加速改建日本的军港。舞鹤、敦贺与佐世保三个港口，目前正被改建为容纳大型战舰的基地。这三个港口的一切初步工程已告完成，目前正在把桥梁修高，以便让大型战舰驶入。干船坞和浮动船坞正在修建中。大凑与新泻两港口，亦已全部加以改建，以便容纳排水量一万吨以上的船只。
    日本政府必须支付改建日本港口的费用。这种改建港口的工程，是按照美国军事工程师的计划，在麦克阿瑟总部的专家们指导之下进行的。由于美国要求高速度进行这种工程，所以费用极大。
