　　Mobile Medical Team Goes to Countryside to Treat Illnesses and Receives Warm Welcome from Farmers
    [Reported by this newspaper] Recently, the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau's mobile medical team provided free treatment in the western suburbs for 24 measles patients and over a hundred patients with general illnesses, receiving a warm welcome from the farmers.

    In early April, measles cases were successively discovered in the 16th district of the western suburbs. After the district government reported this to the Municipal Public Health Bureau, the bureau immediately dispatched a mobile medical team to provide treatment. The 24 measles patients discovered in the district were all children aged between five months and fifteen years. With the exception of one who died due to the severity of the illness before treatment could be administered, all of them gradually recovered through the active and responsible efforts of the medical team staff, utilizing penicillin and sulfonamide antibiotics as effective treatments. In addition, they also treated over a hundred farmers for general illnesses. During the diagnosis and treatment period, patients with minor illnesses were gathered at the medical team's location for treatment, while doctors personally visited the homes of farmers with more severe illnesses to provide care. The farmers expressed great gratitude for the government's concern for their health, saying: "The current government truly belongs to us, the people. It saved our children and adults, without asking for a single penny. We truly have to thank our Chairman Mao." When the mobile medical team left the district, farmers near the Second Administrative Village jointly presented the medical team with a silk banner as a souvenir.

　　巡回医疗队下乡治病受到农民们热烈欢迎
    【本报讯】京市公共卫生局的巡回医疗队最近在西郊免费为农民治愈麻疹患者二十四人及一般疾病患者百余人，受到农民热烈欢迎。
    四月初，西郊十六区先后发现麻疹患者，经区政府反映到市公共卫生局后，该局立即派巡回医疗队前往治疗。发现的该区二十四个麻疹患者都是五个月到十五岁的儿童，其中除一人因病势严重不及治疗死亡外，都经医疗队医务人员的积极负责，利用盘尼西林及磺胺剂特效药的治疗，而逐渐痊愈。另外还顺便治好了一百多农民的一般疾病。诊疗期间，一般轻病患者是集中到医疗队就医，对病势较重的农民，都是由大夫亲自跑到他们家里诊治。农民们对政府这样关心他们的健康，表示非常感激，都说：如今的政府可真是我们人民的了，救了我们的孩子、大人，连一个钱也不要，这真得感谢我们的毛主席。巡回医疗队离开该区时，第二行政村附近的农民们联合送给医疗队锦旗一面作为纪念。
