　　Japanese Finance Minister Ikeda's Visit to the US
    Exposes American Imperialist Conspiracy
    To Delay Signing Peace Treaty with Japan Through "De Facto Peace"
    Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The American imperialist scheme to occupy Japan for a long period and grant the Yoshida government a "de facto peace" has been exposed once again in the incident of Japanese Finance Minister Ikeda's visit to the United States. According to a Reuters Tokyo dispatch on the 19th, quoting the Asahi Shimbun correspondent in New York in a summary of Ikeda's visit, "The occupation authorities in Japan will continue to exist for some time... Any form of peace treaty is unlikely to be signed in the near future, especially this year." The reporter believes that under these circumstances, "Japan and the United States should maintain close ties and formulate specific plans to maintain these ties." The "plan for close US-Japan ties" mentioned by the reporter can be seen in an outline from Ikeda's remarks upon his return to Tokyo on the 22nd. Ikeda said, "The time when Japan obtains de facto peace and is allowed to return to the international community is not far off." Prior to this, Draper, former Deputy Undersecretary of State for Occupied Areas and Vice President of Dillon, Read & Co. of Wall Street, openly declared at a banquet he hosted on the 16th to introduce Ikeda to American financial bankers and industrialists: "The time has come for the Japanese government to apply for membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank... In the current situation in Japan, this will bring Japan one step closer to returning to the international community."

    Although American imperialism is clearly not interested in concluding a peace treaty with Japan, the reactionary Japanese leader Shigeru Yoshida is attempting to use the deceptive propaganda of "hope for peace" to win votes for the Liberal Party's House of Councillors election. According to a United Press report, Yoshida told reporters on the 23rd about Ikeda's visit to the United States: Because Ikeda received a "friendly welcome and assistance" from all walks of life in the United States, "I believe Japan will be able to sign a peace treaty sooner than expected." Yoshida also said that after listening to Ikeda's report, he had received "great encouragement" regarding foreign (referring to the United States) investment. A Kuomintang Central News Agency Tokyo dispatch on the 23rd, quoting political figures, also stated that Yoshida is using Finance Minister Ikeda's visit to the United States as capital for the House of Councillors election on June 4th. Yoshida wants to use this to show that Ikeda's trip has made significant achievements in attracting foreign investment to Japan and accelerating the signing of a peace treaty. However, the facts have completely exposed Yoshida's lies about Japan being able to make peace soon. Ikeda admitted in his remarks on the 22nd that "negotiations on a peace treaty are not within his authority." Shiroshi, who visited the United States at the same time as Ikeda, also said on the 22nd that the US attitude towards the extremely important issue of a peace treaty remains a mystery to him.

### 日本藏相池田访美  暴露美帝对日阴谋  图以“事实上和平”拖延签订和约

　　日本藏相池田访美
    暴露美帝对日阴谋
    图以“事实上和平”拖延签订和约
    【新华社二十七日讯】美帝国主义决心长期占领日本并予吉田政府以“事实上和平”的阴谋，已在日本藏相池田访美的事件中，又一次暴露出来。据路透社东京十九日电引朝日新闻驻纽约特派员在总结池田访美的一则电讯中称：“日本的占领当局将继续存在一个时期……。任何形式的和约在最近将来，均难望签订，特别是在今年。”该记者认为，在此种情势下，“日本与美国应保持密切的联系，并应拟订保持这种联系的具体计划。”该记者所称的“美日密切联系计划”，从池田二十二日返抵东京时所发表的谈话中，可以看出一个梗概。池田说：“日本获得事实上的和平及获准重返国际社会之期，已不在远。”在此以前，美前负责占领区事务的副国务卿及华尔街狄龙·瑞德银公司的副经理德莱伯，于十六日在其所主持的介绍池田给美国金融银行家和工业家的宴会上，曾公然宣称：“日本政府应申请为国际货币基金会及世界银行的会员国的时机已至……就日本目前情形而言，这将使日本返回国际社会更近一步。”

    虽然美帝国主义对于缔结对日和约显然不感兴趣，但日本反动派的首脑吉田茂，却企图以“媾和有望”的欺骗宣传，来为自由党的参院竞选，获取选票。据合众社消息，吉田于二十三日招待记者谈及池田访美一事时称：由于池田在美国获得美国各界人士的“友好欢迎和协助”，“相信日本将可较预期为早地签订和约”。吉田并且说：在听取池田报告后，关于外国（按指美国）投资，他已得到“很大的鼓励”。匪中央社东京二十三日电引政界人士的谈话亦称：吉田利用藏相池田的访美，为六月四日的参院竞选作资本。吉田欲借此表明，池田此行在引诱外国投资日本以及加速签订和约方面，有重大成就。但是事实已完全揭穿了吉田所作关于日本可早日媾和的谎言。池田在二十二日的谈话中即承认，“关于和约的商谈，并不在他职权之内”。与池田同时访美的白洲次郎也于二十二日说：美国对极重要的和约问题的态度，对他说来，仍然是一个谜。
