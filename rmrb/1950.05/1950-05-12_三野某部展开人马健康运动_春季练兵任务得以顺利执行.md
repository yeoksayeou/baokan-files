Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 6th -- A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army, implementing the health work policy of "prevention first, medical treatment as a supplement," has presented a new look in the life of the troops since launching a human and animal health campaign in early March; the spring training mission has also been successfully executed.

　　At the beginning of March, the army conducted a comprehensive and in-depth publicity and education campaign on hygiene and human and animal health, and carried out a major inspection of personal, environmental, and nutritional hygiene. Necessary hygiene facilities and systems were established in each unit from the army headquarters to the company level, and each squad formulated a hygiene pact; many units, in order to improve nutrition, specifically opened training classes for purchasing agents and cooks, making the army's human and animal health campaign quickly become a regular activity. After launching the human and animal health campaign and conducting in-depth education, the commanders and fighters have realized that health is an important source of combat effectiveness. They have come up with many methods and created many new tools to improve the environmental hygiene of the troops. Many company dormitories have their own homemade spittoons, and have created simply equipped "running water" and automatically flushing toilets. Soldiers have now developed the habit of not spitting indiscriminately; they pay attention to washing their hands before and after meals, and eating has been changed to a separate serving system or public chopsticks system; they bathe once a week. To facilitate the treatment and care of patients, the army's units have established wards at the battalion or company level and built separate toilets for patients.

　　In the human and animal health campaign, the army's units also combined it with social hygiene work, adopting various forms of publicity to mobilize residents to move manure tanks and chicken coops near their homes to areas farther away from the living quarters, cooperate with residents in the garrison to dredge ditches, fill in sewage pits, and repair roads. This not only improved the environmental hygiene of the garrison, educated the residents, but also strengthened and strengthened the relationship between the army and the people.

　　三野某部展开人马健康运动
　　春季练兵任务得以顺利执行
    【新华社南京六日电】人民解放军第三野战军某军执行“预防为主医疗为辅”的卫生工作方针，从三月初旬开展人马健康运动以来，部队生活呈现一片新气象；春季练兵任务也得以顺利执行。
    三月初，该军普遍深入地进行了卫生和人马健康的宣传教育，并举行了个人、环境、营养的卫生大检查。从军部到连队各单位都先后建立了必要的卫生设备和制度，每个班都制订了卫生公约；许多单位为了改善营养，专门开办了采买和炊事员训练班，使全军人马健康运动迅速成为经常的工作。该军在展开人马健康运动并进行深入的教育后，指战员们已认识到健康是战斗力的重要源泉，他们想出了很多办法，创造了很多的新工具，来改善部队的环境卫生。许多连队的宿舍内都有自己制造的痰盂，创造了简便设备的“自来水”和自动冲泄的厕所。战士们现在已养成不乱吐痰的习惯；饭前饭后都注意洗手，吃饭改行分食制或公筷制；每周洗澡一次。为便利对病员的治疗和照顾，该军各部都以营或连为单位建立病房，并为病员单独修造厕所。
    该军各部在人马健康运动中，还结合开展社会卫生工作，采取各种宣传方式，动员居民把住屋附近的粪缸和鸡窝移到离居室较远的地区，协同驻地居民疏通沟渠，填盖污水坑，修铺道路。这样不但改善了驻地的环境卫生，教育了居民，并加强和密切了军民间的关系。
