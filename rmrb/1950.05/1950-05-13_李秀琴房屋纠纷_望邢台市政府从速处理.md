　　Li Xiuqin's Housing Dispute
　　Hoping Xingtai Municipal Government Will Expedite Handling
　　Comrade Editor:
    I am writing this letter hoping that comrades from the newspaper can help me resolve a problem. Because I have written to the Xingtai Municipal Government, the Xingtai Municipal Party Committee, the Hebei Daily, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, and the Xingtai Municipal People's Representatives Conference to resolve this issue, but the problem remains unresolved.
    I am a woman from Xiaxi Street, District 3, Xingtai City. I participated in street work when Xingtai was liberated. Because my family had no land or houses, the street allocated two rooms and many items of clothing during the land reform. Later, I continued to work on the street. In my work, I felt I tried my best. However, when dealing with my own marriage, I was unwilling to be suppressed by street cadres. I married a cadre from another place, which angered the street director and some street cadres, and I have been subjected to their attacks ever since. Before my marriage, they openly sabotaged me and even led several street cadres to aggressively find the matchmaker and scold them. Later, because my husband knew people in the Municipal Party Committee, comrades from the Municipal Party Committee criticized them, and I was finally able to get married. After getting married, I lived in a senior primary school for half a year and then came out with my husband to participate in work. However, the street director and some street cadres were still unwilling to give up and continued to make things difficult for me.
    I came out just after the Chinese New Year last year. When I left, the street cadres wouldn't let my mother live in my house, nor would they let me rent it out. I immediately sent them a letter, severely criticizing them, saying that what they were doing violated government policy. Perhaps they were somewhat afraid at the time, so they allowed my mother to live there and allowed me to rent it out. However, after a few days, they said that the house had been handed over to the Municipal Government and that no house had ever been allocated to me in the first place. I was very angry when I heard this and wrote a letter to the Xingtai Municipal Government, citing many reasons, requesting that my housing rights be protected. In total, I wrote four or five letters, and the Xingtai Municipal Government only replied to two, saying that they would "no longer handle" it. They said they couldn't handle the issue unless I went back. However, they avoided mentioning the many specific details I raised (such as why they didn't say anything earlier if they hadn't allocated me a house, why they didn't say anything when I came, and why they allowed me to rent it out after I sent the letter). Later, I wrote another letter to appeal, but the Xingtai Municipal Government never replied again. At the time, I also wanted to go back, but I had just started my job and didn't take leave to go back.
    This dragged on for several months. Having no other choice, I wrote to the Xingtai Municipal Party Committee and the Hebei Daily. The Xingtai Municipal Party Committee did not reply. The Hebei Daily replied, saying that the matter happened in Xingtai and should be handled by the Xingtai Municipal Government, and then there was no further news. So I wrote another letter to the Organization Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee. The Organization Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee replied quickly, but they wanted me to write according to the organizational system and have a letter of introduction from the Xingtai Municipal Party Committee. I wrote another letter, stating that I was not a Party member, and that I wrote to the Provincial Party Committee because the street director and street cadres were Party members. However, after the second letter, it also disappeared without a trace. The letter to the Xingtai Municipal People's Representatives Conference was sent last, and I thought that it would be more direct, but it ended up the same way.
    Now this matter has been dragging on for a year and five months. Now my mother is still renting houses here and there. And the house allocated to me is neither issuing a property certificate (I had already left when the property certificates were issued) nor allowing me to live in it. Whenever I think of this, I feel very angry.
    Comrade Editor: Can this matter only be resolved if I go back? Can the truth of the matter never be clarified if I don't go back? I hope the Xingtai Municipal Government can give me a clear answer.
                                          Li Xiuqin, May 4th
    Editor's Note: Regarding Li Xiuqin's housing issue, we hope the Xingtai Municipal Government will handle it promptly and inform this newspaper of the handling result.

### 李秀琴房屋纠纷　望邢台市政府从速处理

　　李秀琴房屋纠纷
　　望邢台市政府从速处理编辑同志：
    我写这封信，是想叫报社同志替我解决一个问题。因为我为了解决这个问题，曾向邢台市政府、邢台市市委会、河北日报、河北省委会、邢台市各界代表会都去过信，但问题始终没有解决。
    我是邢台市三区下西街的一个妇女，邢台解放时，我就参加了街上工作。因为我家地无一垅，房无一间，土地改革时街上分给两间房子，还有许多衣物。后来我就一直在街上工作。工作中自己觉得还算尽力干。可是因为在我处理自己婚姻时，不愿受街干部压制，自己与一位外地干部结了婚，激怒了街长和一些街干部，我便一直受他们打击。在我结婚前，他们公开破坏我，还领导几个街干部气势汹汹的找介绍人，骂介绍人。后来因为我男人在市委会有认识的人，市委会同志批评了他们，我才算结了婚。结婚后，我住了半年高小，就跟我男人出来参加工作。可是街长和一些街干部，还不肯罢休，还一直和我为难。
    我是去年刚过罢年就出来的，出来时，街干部们不让我母亲住我的房子，也不让我出赁。我立即给他们去了一信，严厉批评他们，说他们那样作是违犯政府政策的。大约当时他们觉得有些害怕，便允许我母亲住，也允许我往外赁。可是没过几天，他们又说房子已交市政府了，过去根本就没分给我房子。我听了很生气，便写信给邢台市政府，举出许多理由，请求保障我的房权。共计前后写了四五封信，邢台市政府只回了两封信，便说“不再处理”了。要处理非我回去不可。而对我所提的许多具体情节（如既然没分给我房子，为啥早点不说，我来时为啥也不说，我去信后，为啥又允许我出赁）却避而不谈。后来我又写信申诉，邢台市政府即再没来信。当时我也想回去，因刚到工作岗位不久，所以没请假回去。
    这样一拖延，好几个月就过去了。没办法，我又给邢台市委和河北日报去信。邢台市委没回音。河北日报回信说，事情发生在邢台，还要由邢台市政府处理，也就再无音讯了。于是又给河北省委组织部去了一信。河北省委组织部很快来了信，可是他们要我按组织系统来信，要有邢台市委会介绍信。我又写去一信，声明我不是党员，因为街长和街干部们是党员，所以我才向省委写信。可是第二封信去了后，又石沉大海了。给邢台市各界代表会的信，是最后去的，我想那样会更直接一点，谁知又是一样的没下落。
    现在这事已经拖了一年又五个月了。现在我母亲还是东找西找的赁房子住。而分配给我的房子，既不给发房产证（发房产证时我已出来），也不让住。我一想起这事，就十分气愤。
    编辑同志：这事难道非我回去一趟不能解决么？难道我不回去，事情的真象，就永远弄不清吗？我希望邢台市政府能明确答复我一句话。
                                          李秀琴五月四日
    编者按：关于李秀琴的房产问题，望邢台市政府迅速处理，并将处理结果告诉本报。
