【Beijing News Agency Dispatch】In order to organize traffic order and ensure traffic safety, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau has issued a notice to all its sub-bureaus to strictly enforce traffic rules and punish violators according to law. Beijing's traffic order was very chaotic in the early days of liberation, but it has improved a lot after rectification. In carrying out traffic management tasks, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has mainly focused on persuasion and education for vehicles and pedestrians who generally violate traffic rules. This method is necessary and effective. However, recently, a few vehicles and pedestrians often ignore public safety and disobey traffic management. They believe that being caught for violating traffic rules will only result in persuasion and education. When traffic police are performing their duties and correcting their violations, they do not reflect on their mistakes but instead make all kinds of excuses or even resist, which has caused many unnecessary obstacles to the implementation of traffic rules, increased traffic accidents, and seriously affected traffic order. In response to this situation, the Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a notice on May 10 to all sub-bureaus that, in addition to persuasion and education, the following situations will be punished according to traffic management rules: 1. Incomplete vehicle equipment, 2. Vehicles not having lights on at night, 3. Disobeying orders, 4. Pedestrians and vehicles not walking or driving according to regulations, 5. Incomplete or non-compliant car license plates and driver's licenses, 6. Incomplete or non-compliant license plates for all types of vehicles (all of the above will be implemented starting May 16). The notice also instructed officers on duty to pay attention to and grasp the following points: 1. Correct the erroneous idea of ​​being laissez-faire and afraid to manage, and strictly implement the rules; 2. Punishment is a way to achieve education, and the idea of ​​"power" should not be generated; 3. The attitude must be amiable.
　　【Another dispatch】A total of fourteen traffic accidents occurred in Beijing in April, a significant increase compared to January, February, and March. Most of the accidents occurred on main roads and suburban roads. Animal-drawn vehicles were the most common cause of accidents, followed by trucks, and the time was mostly from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Although the increase in traffic accidents is due to the increase in vehicles transporting sludge from the Three Seas and ditches, the increase in tourists and travel vehicles since the spring, and the impact of air-raid shelters occupying pedestrian pavements and the construction of road sewers, the main reasons are still drivers or cart drivers driving carelessly, violating traffic regulations, and pedestrians (including bicycles and tricycles) ignoring traffic rules, as well as traffic police management and violation inspections not being serious enough. In order to eliminate traffic accidents and ensure traffic safety, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau has decided to strengthen the education of traffic police, correct the erroneous idea of being laissez-faire and afraid to manage, and earnestly implement traffic rules. In addition, it will conduct in-depth publicity and education to citizens to make them consciously abide by traffic rules, punish violators, and at the same time notify all agencies to educate drivers.

　  公安局严格执行交通规则
    【京市新闻处讯】京市公安局为整理交通秩序，确保行车安全，顷通令所属各分局，严格执行交通规则，对违章者依法处罚。京市交通秩序，解放初期非常紊乱，经整顿后，确是好了许多。市公安局在执行交通管理任务的方式上，对于一般违反交通规则的车辆行人，向以说服教育为主。这一方式是必须而且有效的。惟近来仍有少数车辆行人常忽视公共安全，不服从交通管理，认为违反交通规则被查获也不过是说服教育；并在交通警察执行任务纠察其违章行为时，不自检讨错误，反作百般狡辩，甚至对抗，致使交通规则的贯彻执行受到了许多不必要的阻碍，车祸增多，严重地影响了交通秩序。针对此种情形，市公安局于五月十日通令各分局对违章者除说服教育外，对下列情形则依照交通管理规则，分别予以处罚：１、车辆设备不全，２、车辆夜不燃灯，３、不听指挥，４、行人车辆不按规定行走或驾驶，５、汽车牌照、驾驶员执照不齐或不合规定，６，各种车辆牌照不齐或不合规定者，（以上均自五月十六日开始执行）通令中并指示执勤的员警须注意及掌握以下几点：１、纠正放任不敢管的错误观念，严格地贯彻规则；２、处罚系达到教育的一种方式，不应产生“权力”的思想；３、态度一定要和蔼。
    【又讯】京市四月份共发生车祸十四起，较一、二、三月份显著增多。出事地点多在主要干路及郊路，肇事车辆以兽力车最多，卡车次之，时间多在下午三时至六时。车祸增多原因，虽由于拉运三海及沟道污泥车辆增多，入春以来游人旅行车辆增多，防空壕占行人道地面及修筑马路下水道等的影响，但主要原因仍是司机或赶车者驾驶不慎，违章行驶，以及行人（包括自行车及三轮车）忽视交通规则和交通警管理与违章检查认真不够所致。京市公安局为消除车祸发生，确保行车安全，决定除加强交通警的教育，纠正放任不敢管的错误观念，认真的贯彻执行交通规则外，并向市民进行深入的宣传教育，使其自觉的遵守交通规则，违章者处罚，同时通知各机关向司机进行教育。
