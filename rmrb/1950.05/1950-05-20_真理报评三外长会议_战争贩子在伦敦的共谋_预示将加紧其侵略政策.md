　　【Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 17th】 TASS Moscow, May 17th: *Pravda* commentator, Tyulentiev, stated: The main theme of the Acheson, Schuman, and Bevin London meeting was to intensify the "Cold War" and further prepare for military adventures. Following the London Three Foreign Ministers' meeting, the North Atlantic Council meeting opened on May 15th. The main task the war mongers have now assigned themselves is to drag West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive group's system. We should view the so-called joint management plan for the German-French steel and coal industries (the base of the military and industrial potential of the American-controlled North Atlantic aggressive group), formulated by Washington and proposed by Schuman, from this perspective. It is very clear that, for all true French patriots, this plan not only means the strengthening of American shackles, but also directly endangers the security of France. The author emphasized: The "Schuman Plan" has aroused considerable anxiety among the broad masses of democratic people in Germany. They realize that this is the revival of the alliance between American monopoly capitalists and Ruhr magnates on a new basis. The issue of strengthening the arms race has already loomed large at the London meeting. The American representatives want every country participating in the North Atlantic Group to increase their military expenditure, even though such expenditure is already very heavy for the budgets of Western European countries. American imperialists are also demanding that Western European countries rapidly increase their armed forces. In this way, the American ruling clique, in an atmosphere of growing economic crisis, is imposing this new but heavier expenditure for supplying the adventurous actions of American imperialism on the shoulders of the Western European working people.
　　The author pointed out that the war mongers' conspiracy in London is another attempt by them to undermine the United Nations organization. Their conspiracy foreshadows the Anglo-American imperialist bloc's vigorous intensification of its aggressive policies and further intensification of its "Cold War" policies.
　　Peace fighters will respond to the increasingly aggressive imperialist policies by closing their ranks and strengthening their struggle against the instigators of a new war.

　　真理报评三外长会议
　　战争贩子在伦敦的共谋       
    预示将加紧其侵略政策
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：真理报评论家蒂伦第耶夫称：艾奇逊、舒曼与贝文伦敦会议的主旨，乃是加紧“冷战”和进一步准备军事冒险。继伦敦三外长会谈之后，北大西洋集团理事会会议已于五月十五日开幕。战争贩子们现在给自己安排的主要任务，便是将西德拖入北大西洋侵略集团的体系中。我们应该从这里来注视由华盛顿制定而由舒曼提出的所谓联合经营德法钢铁与煤炭工业（由美国操纵的北大西洋侵略集团之军事潜力与工业潜力的基地）的计划。很明显地，对一切真正的法国爱国者说，这一计划不仅意味着美国束缚之加强，而且直接危及了法国的安全。作者强调指出：“舒曼计划”已在德国广大民主人士中引起了相当大的忧虑不安。他们认识到，这是美国垄断资本家与鲁尔大亨的联盟在新基础上的复活。伦敦会议已经庞然隐现了加强军备竞赛的问题。美国代表要每一个参加北大西洋集团的国家增加他们的军事支出，虽然这种支出对西欧各国的预算来说已是非常沉重。美帝国主义者并且要求西欧各国迅速增加其武装部队。这样，美国统治集团在经济危机日益增长的气氛中，将这一笔供应美帝国主义冒险行动的新的但是更沉重的开支，强加在西欧劳动人民的肩上。
    作者指明，战争贩子在伦敦的共谋是他们破坏联合国组织的又一企图。他们这种共谋，预示着英美帝国主义集团将猛力加紧其侵略政策，将进一步加紧其“冷战”政策。
    和平斗士们将以紧密他们的队伍和加强他们反对新战争挑拨者的斗争，来回答侵略性越来越重的帝国主义政策。
