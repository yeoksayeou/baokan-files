　　Strengthening Guidance for Production Work in Various Districts
    Jincheng County Government Improves Working Methods
    [Reported by this newspaper from Jincheng, Shanxi] Since April, the Jincheng County People's Government of Shanxi Province has been working to improve its leadership style and working methods, and work efficiency has begun to improve. On March 21, the county government convened a meeting of district chiefs and section chiefs to review last year's leadership style and formulate a plan to improve work. The following points have been implemented over the past month:
    (1) A joint office system has been established to strengthen guidance and communication with district governments and cadres working in the countryside. After the spring plowing began, the county government first designated two cadres each from the General Office, the Agricultural Section, and the Civil Affairs Section to hold joint office every five days. Their work focuses on studying the monthly and ten-day reports from various districts and cadres working in the countryside, and promptly communicating the problems, achievements and experiences, shortcomings and lessons learned, etc., found in the reports to the lower levels through letters, phone calls, and circulars, and providing guidance or promotion. This overcomes the past shortcomings of "no reports required, reports not read, and problems not solved even after reading reports." In the past month, two letter communications and several telephone communications have been conducted with various districts; some districts were found and corrected for only paying attention to key leadership and neglecting comprehensive care, as well as neglecting "organization" in the spring plowing and sowing work.
    (2) The method of combining general appeals with individual guidance was mastered, and attention was paid to grasping the main links of spring plowing, conducting inspections, and promoting work. At the beginning of spring plowing, the county first established "superior seed promotion areas" in seven villages including Nan Shi Dian in the Fifth District, with farm work cadres as the main force, cooperating with cadres from various districts to concentrate their efforts on leading the masses to carry out seed transfer, seed exchange, seed soaking, and seed mixing work, and achieved very good results: 93% of the sown seeds were soaked, and the promotion of superior seeds accounted for 84% of the sown seeds. The county government immediately seized the experience from this work and promoted it to various districts, expanding the achievements of seed soaking. After sowing began, in order to complete the timely sowing, the county government transferred 22 cadres to form spring plowing and sowing inspection teams to go deep into various villages to promote work.
    (3) Implement the policy of rewarding production, and encourage the masses' production enthusiasm and improve production technology by rewarding labor models. In spring plowing and sowing, the county government mobilized various labor models and representatives from all walks of life to write letters to each other, encouraging each other and exchanging experiences; at the same time, it prepared to convene labor model meetings in units of districts before hoeing seedlings after sowing, to summarize spring plowing, exchange experiences, reward models, and promote summer hoeing work.
    (4) The communication and liaison system was improved. In April, a meeting of correspondents from various districts was convened, and a unified communication system was stipulated. It ensured smooth upward and downward communication, accuracy and speed, and overcame the past phenomenon of neglecting the transmission of official documents, resulting in loss and delay.
    (5) The meeting system was improved, and regular work and rest hours were stipulated. Before the county government's administrative meeting is convened, each section prepares in advance and submits questions in writing, so that the meeting time is short and many problems are solved. The past phenomenon of holding meetings without preparation, chatting randomly, and wasting time has begun to be overcome. At the same time, the study of general fragmented problems uses the daily meeting after dinner to solve them at any time, correcting the past shortcomings of holding meetings for some small problems, which took up normal working hours. At the same time, it is stipulated and strictly implemented to work and rest on time, overcoming the past shortcomings of no fixed system for the work and rest of the organs, dragging everyone into fatigue and illness, while the work efficiency is still not high. This makes everyone's work, study and rest have fixed times, and life is more regular.
    In addition, communication work has been strengthened, and in conjunction with sorting out work summaries and reports, cadres are organized to write articles for the party newspaper to exchange work experience and reflect the situation. In April alone, the Agriculture Section and the General Office wrote eleven articles.
    Due to the above improvements, the work of the county government has improved a step. After conducting discussions with all cadres at the beginning of May, the county government decided to continue to improve its work in May on the basis of April, and pay special attention to further strengthening the connection between the top and bottom, strengthening the planning of daily work, strengthening business learning, and improving the official document receiving and dispatching system.

　　加强指导各区生产工作
    晋城县府改进工作方法
    【本报山西晋城讯】山西省晋城县人民政府，四月份起致力改进领导作风和工作方法，工作效率已开始提高。该县县府在三月二十一日召开了区长、科长会议，检查了去年的领导作风，制订了改进工作的计划。月余来已开始实行的有下列几点：
    （一）建立了联合办公制度，加强了对区政府和下乡干部的指导与联系。春耕工作开始后，县府首先由秘书室、农业科、民政科各指定干部二人，每五天联合办公一次。其工作是着重研究各区和下乡干部的月报、旬报，随时将报告中发现的问题、成绩与经验、缺点与教训等，用写信、打电话、发通报等方式，及时向下面传达并予以指导或推广。这样，克服了过去“无报告要报告，有了报告不看报告，看了报告也不解决问题”的缺点。一月来已与各区进行了两次信件联系和数次电话联系；发现并纠正了某些区在春耕下种工作中只注意重点领导、忽视照顾全面，以及忽视“组织起来”等缺点。
    （二）掌握了一般号召与个别指导相结合的方法，并注意抓紧春耕主要环节，进行检查，推动工作。春耕开始时，该县首先在五区南石店等七村建立了“优种推广区”，以农场工作干部为主，配合各区干部集中力量领导群众进行了调种、换种、浸种、拌种工作，获得了很好的成绩：下种的百分之九十三实行了浸种，推广优良种籽占下种的百分之八十四。县府即抓紧这次工作中的经验向各区推广，扩大了浸种的成绩。下种开始后，县府为完成按时下种，曾抽调干部二十二人，分别组成春耕下种检查小组，深入各村推动工作。
    （三）贯彻奖励生产政策，以奖励劳动模范来鼓励群众的生产情绪，提高生产技术。在春耕下种中，县府发动各种劳动模范与各界代表互相写信联系，彼此鼓励并交流经验；同时筹备在下种后锄苗前以区为单位召开劳模会议，以总结春耕、交流经验、奖励模范，并以此推动夏锄工作。
    （四）健全了通信、联络制度。四月份召开了各区通信员会议，规定了统一的通信来往制度。保证上通下达、准确迅速，克服了以往不重视公文传达，因而发生丢失、延误等现象。
    （五）健全会议制度，规定按时作息。县府的行政会议，召开前先由各科进行准备，以书面提出问题，做到会议时间短、解决问题多。开始克服了过去开会无准备，临时乱扯，浪费时间的现象。同时一般零碎问题的研究，运用了每日吃晚饭后的接头会随时解决，改正过去因一些小问题，就开会占去正常工作时间的缺点。同时规定并严格执行按时作息，克服过去机关干部工作与休息无一定制度，拖得大家疲劳多病，而工作效力仍是不高的缺点。这样使大家的工作、学习和休息各有定时，生活也较有规律了。
    此外，还加强了通讯工作，结合整理工作总结和报告，组织干部为党报写稿，以交流工作经验，反映情况。四月份仅农业科与秘书室两部门，即写了稿件十一篇。
    由于上述的改进，县府工作提高了一步。县府在五月初召集全体干部进行了研讨之后，决定了五月份继续在四月份的基础上改进工作，并特别注意进一步加强上下联系，加强日常工作的计划性，加强业务学习，健全公文收发制度等项。（李志立、马国良、张文升）
