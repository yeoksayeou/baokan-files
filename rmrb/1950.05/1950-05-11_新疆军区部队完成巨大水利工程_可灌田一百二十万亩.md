Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 10th. Since the troops of the Xinjiang Military Region launched a large-scale production movement, they have completed water conservancy construction projects capable of irrigating 1.21 million mu of land.

The troops stationed in southern Xinjiang have completed the Bachu Honghai Reservoir, which can irrigate 300,000 mu of land; the renovation project of 220 li of old canals that can irrigate 100,000 mu of land; and the scattered canal projects that can irrigate 20,000 mu of land. The troops stationed in Hami have also renovated canals that can irrigate 200,000 mu of land. The construction project of the Dihua Heping Canal, which can irrigate 100,000 mu of land, was also completed in mid-April. This project included paving 12 kilometers of stone slabs, renovating 15 kilometers, excavating 55,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and building aqueducts, car bridges, diversion gates, and drop structures.

After a certain unit of the troops stationed in northern Xinjiang entered Shawan, they first started to build the Xinsheng Canal, which had been silted up for five years and was 30 kilometers long, and the Taiping Canal, which was 20 kilometers long, as well as the Longkou Water Gate project of the dam. The entire project required 80,000 man-days and the excavation of 145,000 cubic meters of earth. The projects started in late March and were completed in late April. The two canals can irrigate a total of 120,000 mu of land. The troops stationed in Huiyuan City, west of Yining, repaired 17 canals capable of irrigating 50,000 mu of land. The Huang Canal, south of Yining City, which can irrigate 320,000 mu of land, had been silted up for 70 years. The renovation project of the canal, after a month of vigorous repairs by commanders and fighters of the troops stationed there and various agencies, schools, and nearby residents in Yining City, costing 250,000 man-days, was completed on April 18 with a water release ceremony held on the Kashi River bank at the canal entrance. When the river water surged into the brand-new canal, irrigating the wheat fields sown by the farmers and the troops, the farmers of all ethnic groups in the villages near the canal stood by the canal and applauded and laughed. An old Uyghur farmer, grateful for the great merits of the Mao Zedong fighters, continuously shouted: "Yaxshasun (Long live) Mao Zedong! Yaxshasun Mao Zedong!"

　　新疆军区部队完成巨大水利工程
    可灌田一百二十万亩
    【新华社迪化十日电】新疆军区部队展开大生产运动以来，已完成了可灌田一百二十一万亩的水利建设工程。
    南疆驻军已完成可灌地三十万亩的巴楚洪海水库、可灌田十万亩的旧渠道二百二十里和可灌田二万亩的零星水渠等整修工程，哈密驻军并整修了可灌地二十万亩的渠道。可灌溉十万亩的迪化和平渠修建工程，亦已于四月中旬完工。此一工程包括铺砌石片十二公里，整修十五公里，挖土五万五千土方和建筑渡槽、车桥、分水闸、跌水等工程。
    北疆驻军某部进入沙湾后，首先着手修建已淤塞了五年的长三十公里的新盛渠和长二十公里的太平渠及拦河坝龙口水闸工程。全部工程需要八万个人工，挖土十四万五千公方。三月下旬各工程分别开工，至四月下旬全工告竣。两渠共可灌田十二万亩。伊宁西面惠远城驻军修好可灌田五万亩的十七条水渠。伊宁市南郊可灌田三十二万亩的皇渠，已淤塞七十年。该渠整修工程，经该地驻军指战员和伊宁市各机关、学校及附近居民一个月的大力抢修，花费人工二十五万个，已于四月十八日在渠口喀什河岸举行放水典礼。当河水汹涌流入崭新的渠道中，灌入农民和部队下种的麦田时，沿渠附近村庄的各族农民，齐立渠旁鼓掌欢笑。一个维族老农民感激毛泽东战士的伟大功劳而连续地喊着：“亚夏颂（万岁）毛泽东！亚夏颂毛泽东！”
