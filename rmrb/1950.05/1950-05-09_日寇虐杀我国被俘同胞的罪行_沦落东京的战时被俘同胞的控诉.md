　　The Japanese寇's crimes of虐killing our captured compatriots
    -- accusations from compatriots沦落in Tokyo during the war

Regarding the Japanese reactionaries' atrocities of虐killing our prisoners of war and forcibly conscripted laborers during the war of aggression against China, according to a report in the Tokyo "Overseas Chinese News" published on February 1st: "Tokyo Overseas Chinese Federation" and "Overseas Chinese Democratic Promotion Association" and other overseas Chinese groups in Japan, convened a symposium with six surviving wartime captured compatriots who are still沦落in Tokyo. According to their recollection of the tragic situation at that time (the newspaper clearly took into account their safety under the current surveillance of the US-Japan reactionaries and Chiang Kai-shek bandit "representative团," and did not publish their names):

　　The treatment after arriving in Japan was extremely惨
　　A: "When we came, there were 433 people; the ship was called 'Huining Maru'; the place of embarkation was Tanggu. Before boarding the ship, some people had already been executed. The situation from North China to here was different for each person. The treatment after arriving in Japan was really extremely惨; there was very little food, and infectious diseases occurred, and many people died. There was too little to eat. Everyone had a hunger strike. The Japanese military police and criminal police then came over, pulled out twenty people, said they were the 'masterminds of the hunger strike,' made them kneel down, and then desperately beat them with wooden sticks and hands, and threatened: 'Whoever disobeys will be killed!'"

　　B: "I was captured by the 1420部队 in Tianjin in 1944. I had been a military medical assistant in the guerrillas in North China. After we 53 people were captured at night, we were interrogated by Sergeant Nishimoto of the military police, who used very cruel torture. I passed out three times when water was灌. Later, I was sent to the 'Labor Association' in Tanggu and locked in a cold storage warehouse; I was beaten until I vomited blood. I forgot the name of the ship that装me to Japan, but I remember that the commander was Kiku Izumi (a lieutenant from the Japan Railway Engineering Co., Ltd.). Thirteen people died on the ship."

　　The house was full of corpse臭
　　C: "When I was studying at Yaohua Middle School in Tianjin, the Japanese military police executed some classmates on the charge of 'bad thoughts.' I was also抓by the 1419部队 and sent to Tangshan. Many people were detained there. On the way to Japan, one or two people died on the ship every day. When we arrived at Moji (Note: a port at the northern tip of Kyushu, Japan), seventy people were sick. Another nine died on the train. We were forced to do hard labor in Muroran (Note: in Hokkaido, Japan, the place is very cold); we had to work from 6 am to 6 pm. Two hundred and seventy people got sick. At most, eighteen people died in a day. The corpses of the dead were left in the house. After a while, when there were enough, they were cremated together. Therefore, the room was full of corpse臭, which was really unbearable! Later, I was transferred from Muroran to根别(Note: also a place name in Hokkaido) to build an airport runway. Seven more people died there."

　　D: "I came to Japan on August 14, 1944. This ship carried 600 people, and nine died on the way. I was sent to Yubari (Note: also in Hokkaido)."

　　E: "The terrible虐treatment in the Heiwa Coal Mine and Kakuta Mine in Oyubari should be重新追究责任."

　　F: "I left Tanggu at 7 pm on March 25, 1945. This is a moment I will never forget. The Japanese military police, police, and traitor plainclothes队伍 followed us front, back, left, and right with light machine guns, box guns, and Japanese-made Type 38 rifles.

　　We 433 people were押on the ship like this. The next morning, we left the motherland. The night before—that is, when we boarded the ship, Mishima, the director of the Tanggu 'Prisoner of War Camp,' gathered everyone for a roll call; it was found that one person was missing out of the 433. That person was Comrade Liu Yongdian. He escaped from the ship that night and hid under a pile of wood stacked on the pier. Unexpectedly, at five o'clock in the morning, when it was about to dawn, the tide rose and浸to his body. He crawled out from under the pile of wood because of the danger and the unbearable cold. Just at this time, Mishima discovered him. Everyone was sweating for him. At this time, Mishima pulled out his military刀and砍at Comrade Liu, only to see blood flowing straight. Then he砍several刀s from the left and right. Our intestines felt like they were断. Everyone was crying, and their faces were distorted with pain. No one could bear to look at that kind of scene directly. Comrade Liu fell to the ground on the spot due to bleeding and pain, completely昏. However, Mishima was too cruel; he even said in Chinese: 'You guy, you have to be sent to Japan even if you die! Can you just settle it by倒down?' While叫, he dragged him onto the ship. Comrade Liu groaned on the ship for two days and two nights, and later, when the ship was about to reach the仁川 waters of Korea, he投in the sea at night."

Regarding the collusion between Chiang Kai-shek's gang "representative团" and the US-Japan reactionaries to sell out compatriots, they also have the following揭露:

　　The Kuomintang "representative" saidshamelessly: "You are the Eighth Route Army, it doesn't matter if you die!"

　　D: "After the end of the war, on August 27, some Chinese came to放us. Then, the 'government representative' came. He wanted us to return to the country. Some of us asked: 'What about those who died?' That 'representative' said粗暴: 'Those from North China are all Eighth Route Army, it doesn't matter if they die!' This person was Liu Zuobin of the Prisoner of War Processing团."

　　Looking forward to the liberated motherland伸雪for them
　　F: "After the recovery of the motherland, our bodies were also free. At this time, we heard news that a large official from a 'Prisoner of War Post-War Processing Committee' sent from our country was coming to Japan. So we who stayed in Hokkaido desperately rushed to Tokyo to see him. We originally wanted to投诉to him about the various pains we had suffered in Japan, hoping that he could solve the problem for us. Unexpectedly, the大official's reply was a few cold words; he said to us: 'You are all Eighth Route Army from North China! Why don't you hurry back to the country! What are you planning to do staying in Japan? If you don't listen to orders, you will be shot!' We were all stunned. What is this! Is this the word of the '钦差大臣' sent from our country? Instead of protecting us, he comes to scare us! The first reason we stayed in Japan after the end of the war was originally to expect that the liberated motherland would send someone to investigate the pain and sacrifices we had suffered in the past, and伸雪for us. Here, we would like to express our gratitude to the Overseas Chinese Federation for taking care of us! At the same time, I feel that I have to mention Li Zengbao's matter. He died in the hospital of the Yubari coal mine in Hokkaido on November 13, 1946. The cause of death was: he was beaten to pieces by the Japanese at the Makotani coal mine where he was doing hard labor at the time, resulting in his death."

　　日寇虐杀我国被俘同胞的罪行
    ——沦落东京的战时被俘同胞的控诉
    关于日本反动派在侵华战争期间虐杀我国俘虏和强征去的工人的暴行，据二月一日出版的东京《华侨民报》报道：“东京华侨联合会”和“华侨民主促进会”等旅日华侨团体，曾召集当时幸免死难、现仍沦落东京的战时被俘同胞六人开了一次座谈会。据他们追述当时的惨状如下（该报显为顾虑他们在目前美日反动派和蒋匪“驻日代表团”监视下的安全，没有将他们的姓名发表）：
    到日本以后的待遇惨极了
    甲：“我们来的时候，有四百三十三名；坐的船名叫‘会宁丸’；上船的地点是塘沽。在上船之前，有一部分人已经被处了死刑。从华北到这里的情形，各人不同。到日本以后的待遇真是惨极了；食物很少，并且发生了传染病，死的很多。吃的东西太少了。大家曾经绝食过。日本的宪兵和刑警这时候就走来，把二十个人拉出来，说他们是“绝食的首谋者”，要他们跪下来，然后用木棍和手拚命殴打他们，并且恐吓说：“谁不听话就杀死谁！”
    乙：“我是在一九四四年被天津的一四二○部队所俘，我曾在华北做过游击队的军医助手。我们五十三个人在夜里被俘后，由西本宪兵伍长审问，用很残酷的刑讯。灌水时气绝了三次。后来被送到塘沽的‘劳工协会’，关入冷冻仓库里去；被殴打到呕血。装我来日本的船名忘记了，但是记得指挥官是泉菊之助（日本铁路工程股份有限公司出身的中尉）。在船上就死了十三个人。”
    房子里充满尸臭
    丙：“在天津耀华中学读书时，日本的宪兵以‘思想不良’的罪名把好些同学处刑。我也被一四一九部队抓了去，送到唐山。那里拘押着许多人。在被送来日本的途中，船上每天都死一两个人。到达门司（按：日本九州北端的港口）时，病倒的人就有七十个。在火车上又死了九个。到了室兰（按：在日本北海道，地方很冷）被强迫做苦工；要从早上六点做到晚上六点。病了二百七十人。死的人，最多时一天有十八个。病死的人，尸体就让它留在房子里，要经过一个时候，等齐了几个才一起火葬。因此，房里充满尸臭，实在难受！后来从室兰被转送到根别（按：也是北海道的地名）去筑飞机场的跑道。在那里又死了七个人。”
    丁：“我是一九四四年八月十四日来日本的。这船载了六百人，中途死了九个。我是被送到夕张（按：也是在北海道）的。”
    戊：“对于大夕张的平和煤矿、角田矿场可怕的虐待情形，应该重新去追求责任。”
    己：离开塘沽时是一九四五年三月二十五日晚上七时。这是我终生忘记不了的时刻。日本宪兵队、警察和汉奸便衣队那时拿着轻机关枪、盒子枪、日本造的三八式步枪在前后左右跟着。
    我们四百三十三人就这样被押上船。第二天早上我们便离开了祖国。在前一天晚上——就是当我们上船的时候，塘沽“俘虏收容所”所长三岛，曾集合大家点名；发现在四百三十三名中缺少了一名。那一名就是刘永典同志。他是当晚逃离了船，躲在堆积在码头上的木料堆下面的。想不到到了早上五点天快亮的时候，潮水涨起来浸到他的身上，他因为危险和受不了冷，便从木料堆下爬出来。刚巧就在这时候，被三岛发觉了。大家都替他捏了一把汗。这时候三岛拔出了军刀，朝着刘同志砍去，只见鲜血直淌。接着又从左右连砍了几刀。我们的肠真像要断了那样难受。大家都流着眼泪，脸孔都因痛苦而扭歪了。谁都不忍正面看那种光景。刘同志由于流血和痛楚，当场倒在地上，完全昏过去了。可是，三岛太残酷了；他还用中国话这样说：“你这个家伙，你死了也得送到日本去！倒下来就能了事吗？”一边叫，一边就把他连拉带扯地拖上了船。刘同志在船上呻吟了两天两夜，后来船快到朝鲜的仁川海面时，便在夜里投了海。”
    关于蒋匪帮“代表团”与美日反动派互相勾结出卖同胞的情形，他们也有如下的揭露：
    国民党“代表”无耻地说：“你们是八路军，死了没关系！”
    丁：“战争结束后，八月二十七日，有中国人来放了我们。接着，‘政府代表’来了。他要我们回国。我们有人问：‘死了的怎样处理呢？’那个‘代表’竟然粗暴地说：‘华北来的，都是八路军，死了没关系！’这个人就是战俘处理团的刘作宾。”
    期待着解放了的祖国替他们伸雪
    己：“祖国光复之后，我们的身体也自由了。这时候，我们听到了一个消息说，从本国派了一个‘俘虏善后处理委员会’的某大官员来日本。我们留在北海道的于是都拚命赶到东京去见他。我们原想把我们在日本受到的种种痛苦向他投诉，希望他能够替我们解决问题。想不到这个大官员的答复却是冷冷的几句话；他这样对我们说：‘你们都是华北的八路军！为什么还不赶快回国去！滞在日本打算干什么？你们如果不听命令，就要枪毙！’我们听了都呆住了。这是什么话！这就是本国派来的‘钦差大臣’的话吗？不来保护我们，反而来恐吓我们！我们在战事结束后还滞在日本，第一个原因本来是指望解放了的祖国会有人来调查我们过去所受的痛苦和牺牲情形，替我们伸雪的。我们在这里再表示感谢华侨联合会对我们的关照！同时，我觉得还要提一提李增宝的事情。他是在一九四六年十一月十三日在北海道的夕张煤矿场的医院里死的。致死的原因是：他曾在当时做苦工的真谷地煤矿被日本人打得片体鳞伤，以致身死。（丘成根据日本东京《华侨民报》编译）（转载自四月十六日南方日报）
