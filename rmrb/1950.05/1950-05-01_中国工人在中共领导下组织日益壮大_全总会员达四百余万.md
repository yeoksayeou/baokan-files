Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Under the correct leadership of the Chinese working class's political party – the Chinese Communist Party – the work of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has achieved significant development over the past year.

According to incomplete statistics, the membership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has grown to over 4,100,000. In cities with a relatively concentrated working class, such as Tangshan and Shanghai, over 80% of workers have been organized into trade unions. Currently, formal provincial and municipal federations of trade unions, or preparatory committees for provincial and municipal federations of trade unions, have been established in the majority of provinces and cities across the country. Among national industrial trade union organizations, the national committees of the railway, postal and telecommunications, and transportation industries have been formally established. National representative conferences have been held and preparatory committees for national committees have been established for the seafarers', textile, and coal mining industries. Working committees have been established for the food, electrical, iron and steel, military industry, machinery, and education workers' industries. The task of these working committees is to be responsible for preparing for the convening of national representative conferences of their respective industrial trade unions in order to formally produce national leadership organizations. The large-scale development of trade union organizations over the past year has been achieved after the National Trade Union Work Conference in July last year emphasized the mass character of trade union organizations and resolutely corrected the errors of closed-doorism. Over the past year, the democratic life of trade union organizations has been greatly promoted due to the advocacy of "everyone running trade unions" and the democratic election of leadership organizations for all trade unions. Furthermore, the "China Labor Association," which originally joined the All-China Federation of Trade Unions as a group member, automatically announced the cancellation of its original organization in the spirit of the great unity of the working class, and the Chinese trade union organization reached complete unity.

220,000 Employees in Nine Cities Including Shanghai and Tianjin Participate in Spare-Time Learning
Under the call and leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese working class carried out heroic struggles to protect factories against the sabotage of the Kuomintang bandit troops before the liberation of the cities, and actively participated in acceptance and inventory work after liberation, so that the enterprises of bureaucratic capital could be transferred to the People's Government as completely as possible. They also rapidly restored production and completed the urgent task of supporting the front lines. After liberation, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions conducted class education and current affairs education among workers, using methods such as large classes, short-term training courses, and symposiums, actively improving the political level of the working masses, thereby gradually eliminating the influence of the Kuomintang's reactionary propaganda on the working masses over the past 20 years, and rapidly disintegrating the Kuomintang's so-called "party," "league," and "trade union" special agent organizations among the workers. Subsequently, according to the workers' demands for formal learning of culture, technology, etc., the All-China Federation of Trade Unions vigorously launched employee spare-time schools. According to statistics from only nine cities, including Shanghai and Tianjin, more than 220,000 people have participated in learning in employee spare-time schools. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has planned to basically eliminate illiteracy among workers within three to five years.

Oriented Towards Production, Implementing Democratic Management, Strengthening Workers' Sense of Responsibility as Masters
In the past year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions resolutely advocated that trade union work should be oriented towards production, correcting the bias towards a purely welfare-oriented viewpoint, while also opposing bureaucratism that does not care about workers' lives. Under the guidance of the "oriented towards production" policy, trade unions in various regions have actively participated in promoting mass movements such as the "responsibility system," "creating new records," and "rationalization proposals" to develop production, achieving great results. Numerous labor heroes and model figures have emerged in the movement. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions also resolutely advocated the transformation of old enterprises, organizing workers to participate in production management in state-owned enterprises in the form of factory management committees and factory employee representative conferences, implementing democratic management, thereby strengthening workers' sense of responsibility as masters in production, and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses. Facts have proven that at the beginning of liberation, in order to facilitate acceptance, the policy of "original position, original salary, and original system" without disrupting the original enterprise structure was completely correct, but after the completion of the acceptance work, this policy was no longer applicable during the management period and must be further transformed. Many cadres do not have sufficient understanding of democratic management, which makes this work become a formality and has not achieved significant results. In private enterprises, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions correctly educated workers with the policy of "developing production, benefiting both labor and capital," overcoming the "leftist" bias among the working masses at the beginning of liberation, and then created the experience of labor and capital signing collective contracts, which was promoted, and proposed a method for resolving labor disputes through trade union negotiation and labor bureau mediation and arbitration, actively promoting it. Subsequently, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also advocated the establishment of labor-capital consultation meetings in private enterprises in order to solve problems more timely and reasonably.

China's Working Class's Status Rises in the Broad International Workers' Movement
Over the past year, with the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the status of the Chinese working class in the international workers' movement has rapidly increased. The obligations of the Chinese working class in the international workers' movement, especially in the workers' movement in Southeast Asian countries, are also increasing. In this year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has sent delegations to the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and other countries for activities, and attended the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress and various conferences of international trade union organizations. Leading cadres of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have also been elected by the above-mentioned international trade union organizations to participate in their leadership work. With the entrustment and assistance of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference in China and established the Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is strengthening internationalist education among workers and vigorously cultivating cadres suitable for participating in international workers' movement activities.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is well aware that there are many major problems that need to be urgently resolved in the great development of China's workers' movement, such as the formulation of unified wage standards and unified labor insurance methods. Although it has already begun research, it has not yet been completed due to the complexity of these issues and the lack of sufficient experience and other difficulties. The resolution of these major issues has been included in the work plan for the next six months in order to complete these arduous tasks related to the vital interests of workers in the shortest possible time.

In order to enable trade union organizations to better play their role as production organizers and protectors of workers' interests in the cause of restoring and developing production, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions will strengthen the establishment and improvement of the organizations of various industrial trade unions and grassroots trade union organizations in the coming year; in state-owned enterprises, it will strive to participate in the transformation of old enterprises, learn to manage enterprises, and carry out rationalization proposals and production competitions to ensure the completion of national production plans; in private enterprises, it will universally promote the method of labor-capital collective contracts and labor-capital consultation meetings to normalize labor-capital relations, so that labor and capital can work together to overcome the current temporary difficulties in China's economic transformation process and gradually embark on the road of development and prosperity. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions believes that it is necessary to mobilize workers across the country to vigorously support the People's Liberation Army, completely annihilate the American-Chiang bandit gangs, and liberate Taiwan and Tibet; it is necessary to support the broad masses of peasants in the struggle to suppress bandits, oppose local tyrants, reduce rent, and prepare for land reform; it is necessary to strive to assist the government in implementing unified financial and economic work and reasonably adjusting industry and commerce. The purpose of all these is to work with the people of the whole country to strive for the fundamental improvement of China's financial and economic situation.

　　中国工人在中共领导下组织日益壮大
    全总会员达四百余万
    【新华社二十九日讯】在中国工人阶级的政党——中国共产党的正确领导下，中华全国总工会的工作，一年来获重大发展。
    据不完全统计，中华全国总工会的会员已发展到四百一十余万人。在工人比较集中的城市，如唐山、上海等地，组织到工会中的工人已达百分之八十以上。目前，全国所有的省、市绝大部分均已成立了正式的省、市总工会，或省、市总工会的筹备委员会。全国性的产业工会组织，现已正式成立全国委员会者有铁路、邮电、搬运等三个，已开过全国代表会议并成立了全国委员会的筹备委员会者有海员、纺织、煤矿等三个，已成立工作委员会者有食品、电业、钢铁、军工、机器、教育工作者等六个，此项工作委员会的任务为负责筹备召开各该产业工会的全国代表大会，以便正式产生全国性的领导机构。一年来工会组织的大量发展，是去年七月全国工会工作会议强调工会组织的群众性和坚决纠正关门主义的错误后所达到的。一年来，由于提倡“大家办工会”并民主选举一切工会组织的领导机构，工会组织的民主生活得以大大发扬。又由于原来以团体会员资格加入全国总工会的“中国劳动协会”，本着工人阶级大团结的精神自动宣布取消其原有组织，中国工会组织即达于完全的统一。
    沪津等九个城市的职工廿二万人参加业余学习
    在全国总工会的号召与领导下，中国工人阶级在城市解放前进行了英勇的反对国民党匪军破坏的护厂斗争，解放后积极参加接收清点工作，使官僚资本的企业得以尽可能完整地转为人民政府所有。他们更迅速恢复生产，完成了紧急的支援前线的任务。解放以后，全国总工会在工人中普遍进行了阶级教育与时事教育，用上大课、办短期训练班、开座谈会等方式，积极提高了工人群众的政治水平，从而逐渐扫除国民党二十年来对工人群众的反动宣传的影响，迅速瓦解了国民党在工人中的所谓“党”、“团”、“工会”等特务组织。其后，根据工人群众对文化、技术等正规学习的要求，全国总工会即大力开办职工业余学校，仅据上海、天津等九个城市的统计，已有二十二万余人参加了职工业余学校的学习。全国总工会已拟争取三五年内基本上消灭工人中的文盲。
    面向生产实行民主管理工人主人翁责任感加强
    过去一年，全国总工会坚决主张工会工作要面向生产，纠正单纯福利观点的偏向，同时也反对不关心工人生活的官僚主义。在“面向生产”的方针指导下，各地工会曾积极参加推行“负责制”、“创造新纪录”、“合理化建议”等发展生产的群众运动，取得很大成绩，在运动中曾出现无数的劳动英雄与模范人物。全国总工会并坚决主张改造旧企业，在公营企业中以工厂管理委员会与工厂职工代表会议等形式，组织工人参加生产管理，实行管理民主化，从而加强了工人在生产中的主人翁责任感，发挥了工人群众的积极性与创造性。事实证明：解放之初，为了便于接收，不打乱原来的企业机构，采用“原职原薪原制度”的政策是完全正确的，但接收工作完成后，在管理时期，这一政策即不适用，而须进一步采取改造的政策。不少干部对管理民主化认识不足，使这一工作流于形式，尚无重大成绩。在私营企业中，全国总工会正确地以“发展生产，劳资两利”的政策方针教育工人，克服了解放初期工人群众中“左”的偏激，进而创造了劳资双方签订集体合同的经验，予以推广，提出了由工会交涉谈判及劳动局调解仲裁解决劳资争议的办法，积极推行。其后，全国总工会又倡导在私营企业里建立劳资协商会议，以便更能及时合理解决问题。
    在广大国际工人运动中我国工人阶级地位提高
    一年来，随着中国人民革命的胜利，中国工人阶级在国际工人运动中的地位已迅速提高了。在国际工人运动特别是在东南亚各国的工人运动中中国工人阶级应负的义务也日益加重。全国总工会在这一年内曾选派代表团分赴苏、波、罗、德、捷、匈等国活动，并出席世界工联代表大会及各种工会国际组织的会议。中华全国总工会的领导干部并被上述各国际工会组织推选参加其领导工作。全国总工会在世界工联委托与帮助下，在我国召开了亚澳职工代表会议，并在北京成立了世界工联的亚澳联络局。全国总工会正加强工人中的国际主义教育，大力培养适于参加国际工人运动活动的干部。
    全国总工会深知我国工人运动大发展中有许多主要问题急须解决，如制定统一的工资标准与统一的劳动保险办法等，虽早已着手研究，但由于这些问题非常复杂而又缺乏足够的经验及其他种种困难，迄今尚未完成。这些重大问题的解决，已列在今后半年的工作计划中，以求在尽可能的短期，完成这些关系工人切身利益的艰巨工作。
    为了在恢复与发展生产事业中，工会组织能够更好的发挥其生产组织者与工人利益保护者的作用，全国总工会将在今后一年中加强建立与健全各产业工会的组织和工会基层组织的工作；在公营企业中，努力参加改造旧企业，学会管理企业，开展合理化建议与生产竞赛，以保证国家生产计划的完成；在私营企业中，普遍推行劳资集体合同与劳资协商会议的办法，使劳资关系正常化，以便劳资双方共同努力，克服目前中国经济在改造与转变过程中的暂时困难，逐渐走上发展与繁荣的道路。全国总工会认为：必须动员全国工人，大力支援人民解放军，彻底歼灭美蒋匪帮，解放台湾和西藏；必须支援广大农民群众剿匪、反霸、减租和准备土地改革的斗争；必须努力协助政府贯彻统一财经工作和合理调整工商业。所有这些，其目的是与全国人民一起，争取我国财政经济情况根本好转的到来。
