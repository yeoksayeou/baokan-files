　　Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee Production Maintenance Report
    Shanghai Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee Deputy Director Hu Jue Wen
    [This News Report] According to the Shanghai Liberation Daily news on April 25th: At the Third Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference on April 17th, Hu Jue Wen, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, made the "Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee Production Maintenance Report," the full text of which is as follows:
    Chairman, esteemed representatives:
    On behalf of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, I will report to the conference on the current situation of industry and commerce in Shanghai:
    To sum up the current situation of industry and commerce in Shanghai, it is the inevitable difficult stage in the process of transforming from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal economy to an economy suitable for the New Democracy. After this difficult stage, the beginning of the prosperity of the New Democratic economy will follow. Today, I mainly want to report on how to overcome difficulties and maintain the development foundation of private economy that conforms to the New Democracy. Overcoming difficulties is like prescribing the right medicine for the illness. Therefore, before prescribing the medicine, the symptoms must be analyzed clearly, that is, the reasons for the difficulties must be analyzed clearly, so that a plan to overcome the difficulties can be proposed.
    The current difficulties of industry and commerce in Shanghai have their historical roots. The main root is that Shanghai's industry and commerce grew up in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal environment. Therefore, its existence was all for the convenience of imperialist economic aggression. At the same time, its supply was only for the enjoyment of feudal landlords and bureaucratic compradors. Therefore, Shanghai's commerce mainly served the surplus commodities of imperialism and was comprador in nature. Shanghai's industry was mainly light industry, which was the re-installation industry of imported semi-finished products. The basic industry and raw material industry were very weak. Raw materials and tools mostly relied on foreign imports. Therefore, even industry was comprador in nature and contributed to imperialist economic aggression. Without dependence on the imperialist economy, it would have no room for survival. Over the years, countless Chinese national bourgeoisie have failed and fallen in the struggle against imperialist economic aggression. Especially since the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled, on the one hand, they more shamelessly relied on imperialism, and on the other hand, they used the method of currency inflation to plunder the wealth of the vast number of people. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to suppress the people's liberation movement, this development became more acute, thus making Shanghai's industry and commerce further detached from the needs of the vast number of people and had to serve the needs of imperialism and reactionary rule.
    Before liberation, Shanghai's industry and commerce achieved deformed development, showing false prosperity, because at that time, currency was hyperinflating. In order to protect their lives, the general public, young and old, men and women, no one was willing to keep paper money in their hands overnight. Any remaining purchasing power was invested in materials. No matter what materials, they became the object of people's savings. A large number of speculative capital, led by bureaucratic capitalists, frantically speculated on materials, hoarding them in large quantities to plunder the interests of the people. Therefore, a false purchasing power that was not real consumption was created in the market, making Shanghai's industrial production deformed development. Therefore, some of the accumulated funds were used to expand production equipment to increase production. At the same time, because the depreciation of currency was rapid, the profits of enterprises far exceeded the burden of loan interest. Therefore, most of the working capital of general enterprises relied on loans. In this way, they also obtained the benefits of currency inflation. In addition, the huge profits obtained from the distribution of low-priced foreign exchange made Shanghai's industrial production blindly expand and completely detached from actual consumption. At the same time, some of the products were exported to Nanyang, replacing Japan's market in Nanyang, making Shanghai's industrial and commercial development reach its peak on a false basis. On the other hand, bureaucratic compradors, speculators, and local tyrants and landlords lived an extravagant life because they could easily obtain windfall profits, and some industries and commerce produced and operated high-end consumer goods to meet their needs, and also obtained deformed prosperity. With a thunderbolt, Shanghai was liberated. All the conditions for the false development of industry and commerce before liberation were quickly eliminated. First, the huge bureaucratic speculative capital was eliminated, and the currency value was relatively stabilized. People no longer need to hoard materials to protect their lives. Therefore, the false purchasing power created in the past naturally disappeared completely. Relying on real consumption, the market must be much more萎缩 than in the past. Because the currency is relatively stable, the interest expenditure of industry and commerce that used to rely on loans for turnover immediately became a burden on operation. Those who used to get rich by using currency inflation, this condition disappeared now because the currency is stable. At the same time, bureaucratic tyrants and speculators fled, and people's lives tended to be simple. The market for high-end consumer goods naturally disappeared. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and the US imperialists blockaded the seaports, and industry and commerce that originally relied on foreign raw materials and foreign markets suffered a serious blow. At the same time, because development was easy in the past, management was wasteful, institutions were large, organizations were bloated. After liberation, the entire economic environment underwent fundamental changes, making Shanghai's industry and commerce, which was suitable for the past environment, naturally unsuitable for today's new environment. Therefore, Shanghai's industry and commerce had to transform the past semi-colonial economy into an economy suitable for the New Democracy. In this transformation process, all industries and commerce that prospered for the enjoyment of bureaucratic compradors, local tyrants and landlords had to be eliminated in the current environment. These eliminated objects will naturally feel very painful. Even the industry and commerce related to people's livelihood necessities that can serve the masses and lay the foundation for the development of the New Democratic economy also feel pain and difficulty in this transformation process due to different development directions in the past and unreasonable management.
    Since liberation ten months ago, many of our Shanghai industrialists and businessmen have progressed with the times in their thinking, but there are also some who have always been suspicious and cannot keep up with the changes of the times. Therefore, the operating methods have also retained the past style, which has hindered the transformation of Shanghai's industry and commerce and increased the difficulties in the transformation process. For example, when prices fluctuated slightly at the end of October last year, some industrialists and businessmen used the speculative style of the past to help increase the height and breadth of price fluctuations. As a result, the degree of the current difficulties of industry and commerce has been deepened, making some industry and commerce that could have been maintained now in a precarious situation.
    Since the reasons for the current difficulties of industry and commerce in Shanghai are as mentioned above, then what are the main contents of the difficulties?
    First, the consumer market is萎缩, and the production institutions remain the same, making production and consumption out of sync, forming serious losses; second, it is because of the serious losses that the working capital is exhausted, and the social credit is all lost in it, resulting in inflexible turnover, and forced factory shutdowns and store closures; third, because of the萎缩 closure of industry and commerce, labor-capital disputes have been expanded, making both labor and capital feel very painful, and seriously affecting the economic foundation of legitimate industry and commerce. Therefore, we must overcome the difficulties in time, maintain production, and tide over the current difficult stage.
    Our Shanghai industrialists and businessmen will never and should not be pessimistic and disappointed about the current difficulties. On the contrary, we should have great confidence in the future prosperity.
    Although there are very few industrialists and businessmen who cannot withstand the test; some have gone to Hong Kong, or nearby places to avoid difficulties, but that is not enough to represent all Shanghai industrialists and businessmen. Most of our Shanghai industrialists and businessmen deeply understand that adversity can rejuvenate the country. Similarly, the current difficulties of our industry and commerce are the prelude to future improvement. The foundation for future improvement of industry and commerce is being laid in the current difficult process. Moreover, the conditions for future improvement are gradually maturing. For example, the currency inflation that harms the development of legitimate industry and commerce the most has now basically stopped. Therefore, prices have been relatively stabilized. The government is using great efforts to increase agricultural production. After this year's autumn harvest, the purchasing power of farmers may be improved. The liberation of Taiwan is not far away, and the seaports will be open. Then, some of the foreign raw materials that are currently lacking can be supplied, and some of the industrial finished products and agricultural products for export can regain the market and become active. But it is undeniable that although the conditions for the improvement of industry and commerce are gradually maturing, there is still a process to be gone through before the improvement scene. According to the current development of industry and commerce difficulties, if we do not strengthen confidence, strengthen unity, and engage in necessary efforts, it will not be easy to tide over this stage smoothly.
    Therefore, we suggest to the conference:
    We must overcome the current difficulties, and we have the confidence to overcome the current difficulties, but to overcome the difficulties, we must start from two aspects, targeting the above-mentioned reasons for the difficulties. First, it is streamlining and saving, and second, it is replenishing working capital.
    Let's talk about streamlining and saving first. Because the blind development of production before liberation resulted in large production institutions, bloated organizations, huge expenditures, and high costs. After liberation, the environment was transformed, and the conditions for false prosperity were eliminated. Production and sales naturally 萎缩. Therefore, production institutions are too large, and production personnel are too many. On the one hand, in its market, because supply exceeds demand, price competition is fierce, making the selling price out of sync with the cost. Therefore, the strength is increasingly lost. On the other hand, because maintaining large institutions and supporting many personnel, a dangerous situation of sitting and eating the mountains is formed. This is the main reason for the continuous bankruptcy of industrial and commercial enterprises and the gradual expansion of labor-capital disputes. Naturally, some industrial and commercial enterprises that are not suitable for the New Democratic economy will inevitably be eliminated in the transformation process. We do not need to cherish this elimination. However, we have to pay attention to the same situation in industrial and commercial enterprises related to people's livelihood necessities. Therefore, we must propose the method of streamlining and saving in this most difficult stage to make production match the market and make the cost close to the selling price. However, streamlining and saving must be carried out simultaneously from two aspects. On the one hand, it is necessary to simplify institutions and try to reduce management costs and management personnel to make business enterprise. On the other hand, in order to cooperate with the current market situation, plannedly change the direction of production, adjust the quantity of production, and lay off the surplus labor force in a negotiated manner with the labor side, or dismiss them. Overly high wages should also be reduced appropriately in a negotiated manner with the labor side to make expenditures reasonable and costs reduced. However, leave-without-pay and dismissal must be combined with unemployment relief to be in line with the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital. Therefore, we suggest adopting the principle of unemployment relief in Beijing. The laid-off employees should be given relief, and the funds for unemployment relief should be borne jointly by our industrial and commercial circles. Only in this way can streamlining and saving be carried out smoothly under the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital, so that the laid-off employees will not suffer the pain of unemployment.
    The second is to replenish the source of working capital.
    The exhaustion of working capital of various enterprise institutions is certainly due to the blind expansion of production institutions before liberation, making most of the funds used for production equipment. Therefore, the working capital was originally weak, and the escape of wealthy capital and some speculative capital abroad before liberation reduced the source of working capital; at the same time, it is also undeniable that since liberation ten months ago, production and the market have never been on the right track. Almost most of the industries and commerce are losing money. Especially the originally weak production funds are even more unable to turn around. In addition, because of the current contraction of currency, the credit is also tightened. The result must make the market more 萎缩. The roads to raise working capital in the past are almost all blocked. Now even the mortgage loans for raw materials and finished products are impossible. Therefore, the operation of industry and commerce is stagnant, and the phenomenon of work stoppage and closure occurs. It is very urgent to maintain the current production business and overcome the difficulties of working capital. Therefore, we suggest to the government: First, under the premise of not harming the government's current policy of contracting currency and stabilizing prices, give appropriate loans to production businesses related to people's livelihood necessities, acquire finished products and order goods. Naturally, on the one hand, we ask the government to maintain production, and on the other hand, we must do our own part to ensure self-sufficiency and have the ability to reproduce and have the credit to guarantee repayment. Second, for the capital owner's or shareholder's advance payments and the salaries stored in this institution by the affiliated employees, allow them to give interest not exceeding the market price, and do not treat them as private lending and sales of goods, because the current production is still蚀本. It is impossible for shareholders to increase capital in fact, but those who are in charge of production business must try their best to raise funds in order to maintain production. Now it is troublesome to borrow from the line, the conditions are strict, and the line funds are also very weak, and cannot meet the requirements of the current production business. Therefore, they have to find ways to borrow from shareholders or investors. Many employees are also willing to deposit their wages in this institution for turnover in order to solve the turnover difficulties of this institution, but the relevant parties, in order to eliminate private lending, the capital owner's borrowings and the employee's salary deposits, are treated as private lending and must be punished, otherwise, they are treated as sales of goods and "business tax is levied." We, the industrial and commercial circles, fully agree with eliminating private lending, but in the current situation where it is so difficult to raise funds, is it possible for the relevant parties to temporarily not treat the capital owner's and shareholder's advance payments and the employee's salary deposits as private lending, and allow them to give interest not exceeding the listed price, so that there will be one more way to raise funds? If the result of the trial makes private lending revive again, it can naturally be stopped immediately; Third, it is recommended that the central government promulgate the Company Law as soon as possible to determine the rights and responsibilities of investors, otherwise, promulgate a temporary measure to encourage investment interest. Because the Company Law has not yet been promulgated, people with funds have a suspicious and fearful mentality, fearing that the profits will not be distributed after the investment, and that they will bear unlimited liability if the business fails. Especially recently, when labor-capital disputes occur, some labor parties will besiege the residences of directors, supervisors, or shareholders, demanding that directors and shareholders bear unlimited liability; when enterprise institutions go bankrupt and liquidate, some creditors will also besiege directors and shareholders, forcing the shareholders with limited liability to bear the responsibility of unlimited liability. These phenomena have further increased the fear of investors, making those with funds have no courage to invest funds in production business again. Therefore, we hope that the government will promulgate the Company Law as soon as possible, and clearly determine the rights and responsibilities of investors in order to relieve the fearful mentality of investors. If the official Company Law cannot be promulgated for a while, then promulgating a temporary measure is also good, so that there will be one more way to raise funds.
    Finally, more importantly, naturally, we industrialists and businessmen themselves should make the greatest efforts, take out all the strength that we can take out, and try our best to collect the funds that can be collected from home and abroad, to replenish the current turnover strength, so that we can barely tide over the current difficult stage to prepare for the arrival of improvement. At the same time, we industrialists and businessmen must step up our learning so that we can thoroughly understand the content and laws of the New Democratic economy, so that our management can meet the requirements of the development of the New Democratic economy and reduce the strength that we offset due to the disconnection between management and the times. In this way, maybe we can make one point of strength exert the effect of two points. Especially important, our industry associations must be strengthened and expanded to improve the effect of mutual help and cooperation among industries and lay a good foundation for future planned economy.
    My report is over.

　　上海工商业联合会筹备会维持生产报告
    上海市工商联筹备会副主任委员  胡厥文
    【本报讯】据四月二十五日上海解放日报消息：在四月十七日上海市第三届各界人民代表会议上，上海市工商联筹备会副主任委员胡厥文作了《工商业联合会筹备会维持生产报告》，全文如下：
    主席、各位代表：
    我代表上海工商业联合会筹备会向大会报告一点目前上海工商业的情况：
    目前上海工商业的情况，总说一句，是由半殖民地半封建经济改造成为适合于新民主主义经济的过程中必然会发生的艰苦阶段，经过这一个艰苦阶段之后，接着来的就是新民主主义经济繁荣的开始。我今天主要要报告的是如何来克服困难，使合乎新民主主义的私营经济保持它的发展基础；克服困难，正如对症下药，因此在未下药之前，必须先将病症分析清楚，也就是说，将所以发生困难的原因分析清楚，这样才能提出克服困难的方案。
    现在上海工商业的困难，是有它的历史根源的，主要的根源，是因为上海工商业过去是从半殖民地半封建的环境中生长起来的，因此它的存在，一切都为了适合于帝国主义经济侵略的方便，同时它的供应，也只是为了封建地主与官僚买办们的享受，所以上海的商业主要是替帝国主义的剩余商品服务，是买办性质的，上海的工业，主要的也只是轻工业，是进口半制品的改装工业，基本工业与原料工业是非常薄弱的，原料与工具大都靠外洋输入，因此连工业也是带有买办性的，也有助于帝国主义的经济侵略的，脱离了帝国主义经济的依附，就没有它生存的余地，多少年来，中国的民族资产阶级为了与帝国主义的经济侵略作斗争，失败倒下去的不知有多少；尤其自抗战以来国民党反动派统治，一方面更无耻的依靠帝国主义，一方面用通货膨胀的方法，掠夺广大人民的财富，抗战胜利之后，为了镇压人民解放运动，这个发展，更加尖锐，因此使上海的工商业更进一步的脱离了广大人民的需要，不得不为帝国主义与反动统治的需要而服务。
    解放之前，上海的工商业，得到畸形的发展，表现着虚伪的繁荣，因为当时通货恶性膨胀，一般人民，为了保障自己的生活，老老少少男男女女，没有一个人愿意将纸币放在自己手中过一夜的，任何一点剩余的购买力，都投到物资上去，无论什么物资，都成为人民储蓄的对象，更有以官僚资本家为首的大批投机资本，疯狂的向物资投机，大量的囤积居奇，来掠夺人民的利益，因此在市场上创造了并非真实消费的虚伪购买力，使上海的工业生产得到畸形的发展，于是把部分的积累资金扩大生产设备，来提高生产量，同时因为币值贬落的迅速，企业利润，远超过借款利息的负担，所以一般企业的周转资金多数依靠借贷，这样又获得了通货膨胀的利益，再加上分配低价外汇所得的厚利，使上海的工业生产，盲目的膨胀，与实际消费完全脱了节，同时将一部分的生产品，以代替日本在南洋的市场为号召，又争向南洋输出，使上海工商业的发展，在虚伪的基础上，发展到了最高峰。另一方面官僚买办投机分子以及豪绅大地主因为易于获得暴利，过着穷奢极侈的生活，而一部分工商业，为适应其需要而生产，经营高贵的消费品，也获得了畸形的繁荣。一声霹雳，上海解放了，一切解放前虚伪的发展工商业的条件，很快都全部被消灭，第一、雄厚的官僚投机资本被消灭了，币值也得到了相对的稳定，人民也不须以囤积物资来保障自己的生活，因此，过去被创造出来的虚伪购买力，自然完全没有了，依靠真实的消费，市场就必然的要比过去萎缩得多，因为通货相对的稳定，过去靠借贷来周转的工商业，立刻就发生利息的支出变成了经营上的一笔负担，过去靠利用通货膨胀发财的，现在因通货稳定这种条件也消失了，同时官僚豪绅投机者逃跑了，人民生活趋向朴素，高贵消费品的市场自然消灭了。再加上蒋匪与美帝封锁海口，本来依靠外来原料与国外市场的工商业，更受到了严重的打击，同时因为过去发展容易，形成了管理浪费，机构庞大，组织臃肿，解放以后，整个经济环境，起了本质的变化，使适合于过去环境的上海工商业，自然不适合于今日的新环境，于是上海的工商业，不得不将过去半殖民地经济改造成为适合于新民主主义的经济，在这个改造的过程中，一切过去为官僚买办、豪绅地主的享受而繁荣起来的工商业，不得不在现在的环境中被淘汰，这些被淘汰的对象，自然会感到十分痛苦，就是可以为大众服务，为新民主主义经济发展作基础的那种与民生必需有关的工商业，也因过去发展的方向不同，与经营的不合理，在这个改造过程中，同样也感到痛苦与困难。
    解放十个月以来，我们上海的工商业家，思想跟着时代进步的固然不少，但始终怀着疑惧，跟不上时代转变的也有，因此连带到经营的方法也依旧保留过去的作风，这样，使上海工商业的改造受到阻碍，而增加了改造过程中的困难，譬如去年十月底物价稍一波动，有些工商业家就运用过去那套投机作风，助长了物价波动的高度与阔度，结果，加深了今日工商业困难的程度，使一部分本来可维持的工商业现在也弄得岌岌可危。
    目前上海工商业困难的原因，既如上述，那末困难的主要内容是些什么呢？
    第一消费市场萎缩，而生产机构依旧，使生产与消费脱节，形成严重的亏损；第二是因为严重的亏损而引起的周转资金耗光，社会的信用都赔贴在里面，发生周转不灵，而被迫工厂停工，商店倒闭；第三因为工商业萎缩倒闭，而扩大了劳资纠纷，使劳资双方都感到十分痛苦，而且严重地影响了正当工商业的经济基础，因此我们必须及时的克服困难，维持生产，来渡过目前的艰苦阶段。
    我们上海工商业家决不会也不应该对目前的困难悲观失望，相反的，对将来的繁荣应具极大的信心。
    虽然有极少数的工商业者，受不起考验；有远走香港的，或附近地处躲避困难的，但那不足代表上海全体工商业家，我们上海多数工商业家，深切了解，多难可以兴邦。同样的目前我们工商业的困难，也正是将来好转的先声，将来工商业好转的基础，也正是从现在困难的过程中奠定的，而且将来好转的条件，现在正在逐渐成熟。例如最使正当工商业发展受害的通货膨胀，现在已经基本上停止，因此物价已经得到相对的稳定，政府用大力增加农业生产，今年的秋收以后，农民的购买力，就可能提高。台湾解放，为期已经不远，海口就可畅通，那末现在缺少的部分外来原料，可以得到供应，一部分外销的工业成品和农产品，也可以重得市场而活跃起来。但毋庸讳言的，工商业好转的条件尽管正在逐渐成熟，但离开好转的场面，还须要有一段过程，照目前工商业困难发展的情况来说，我们大家如果不加强信心加强团结从事必要的努力，要想顺利渡过这一个阶段那还是不很容易的。
    因此我们向大会建议：
    我们必须克服目前的困难，而且我们有信心来克服目前的困难，但是要克服困难必须针对着上述困难的原因从两方面入手，第一，就是精简节约，第二，就是充裕周转资金。
    先讲精简节约，因为解放以前，盲目发展生产的结果，使生产机构庞大，组织臃肿，开支浩大，成本高昂，解放以后，环境改造，虚伪繁荣的条件消灭，产销自然萎缩，因此生产机构就嫌过大，生产人员也嫌过多，一方面在其市场上，因为供过于求，于是削价竞争，使售价与成本脱节，因此实力日益亏损，另一方面因为维持庞大的机构，供养众多的人员，形成坐吃山空的险境，这是目前工商事业不断倒闭劳资纠纷逐渐扩大的主要原因，自然，一部分不适宜于新民主主义经济的工商事业，在改造过程中必然会被淘汰，这种淘汰，我们也不必有所顾惜，但与民生必需有关的工商事业，也发生同样情况，这点我们不得不注意的，因此我们必须在此最困难的阶段，提出精简节约的办法，使生产与市场配合，使成本与售价接近，但精简节约，必须从两方面同时并进，一方面是要简化机构，极力减少管理费用与管理人员，使经营企业化，另一方面，为配合目前市场情况，有计划的改变生产方向，调节生产数量，将过剩的劳动力与劳方用协商的方式予以留职停薪或解雇，过高的工资，也与劳方用协商的方式，酌量减低使开支合理，成本减轻，但留职停薪与解雇必须同救济失业结合的进行，才符合劳资两利的原则，所以我们建议采用北京救济失业的原则。被裁员工予以救济，失业救济的经费由我们工商业界共同来负担，这样才能在劳资两利的原则下，使精简节约能够顺利的进行，使被裁员工不致遭受失业的痛苦。
    第二是充裕周转资金的来源。
    目前各企业机构周转资金的枯竭，固然由于解放前盲目扩大生产机构，使资金大部用于生产设备，因此周转资金本来薄弱，又加以豪门资本与一部分投机资本，在解放以前，逃避国外，减少了周转资金的来源；同时也毋庸讳言的，解放十个月以来，生产与市场始终没有走上正规，工商百业，差不多大部分是亏本的，尤其是原来薄弱的生产资金，更陷于无法周转的地步，再加上目前因为收缩通货，连带的信用也紧缩了，这样的结果，必然使市场更加萎缩，过去筹措周转资金的道路，差不多条条都塞住了，现在连原料与成品的抵押借款，也不可能。因此使工商业的运转停滞，发生停工歇业倒闭的现象，为维持目前的生产事业，克服周转资金的困难，是非常急迫的。因此我们建议政府：第一，在不妨害政府目前收缩通货稳定物价的政策下，对于民生必需有关的生产事业，予以适当的贷款，收购成品与定货。自然，我们一面向政府要求维持生产，一面必须自己做到保本自足，有再生产的能力，有保证还款的信用。第二，对资本主或股东的垫款及所属职工存储于本机构的薪资，准予酌给不超过市场牌价的利息，并不作为私营拆放及进销货论，因为目前生产还在蚀本，要股东增加资本，事实上不可能，但主持生产事业的人，为了维持生产，不得不想尽方法去筹措资金，现在向行庄贷款一则手续麻烦，条件严格，而且行庄资金也非常薄弱，无法满足目前生产事业的要求，于是不得不向股东或出资人设法借贷，有的职工为了解除本机构的周转困难，自愿的将薪工存在本机构作周转之用的情况也很多，但有关方面，为消灭私营拆放，资本主的借入款与职工的薪工存款，都作为私营拆放论，要加以处罚，不然，就作进销货论，“课以营业税”消灭私营拆放，我们工商业界完全赞成，但在目前筹措资金如此困难的情形下，是否请有关方面暂时的对资本主与股东的垫款及职工的薪资存款不作为私营拆放，并允许酌给不超过牌价的利息，使筹措资金多一条路，如其试行的结果，使私营拆放又趋复活，自然立刻可以停止；第三，建议中央早日颁布公司法，确定投资人的权利与责任，不然，颁布一个临时办法，以鼓励投资的兴趣。因为目前公司法还没有公布，使有资金的人抱着怀疑与恐惧的心理，生怕投资之后盈利所得不能分红，如其经营失败，却要负无限责任，尤其近来劳资纠纷时，有部分劳方就去包围董监或股东住宅，要董监与股东负无限责任；企业机构发生倒闭清理时，有部分债权人也去包围董监与股东，强使有限责任的股东，要他负无限责任的责任。这些现象，更增加了出资人的恐惧，使有资金者没有勇气再将资金投入生产事业，因此我们希望政府早日颁布公司法，明令确定出资人的权利与责任，以解除投资者的恐惧心理。如果正式的公司法一时不能公布，那末公布一个临时办法也好，这样也可以使筹措资金多一条道路。
    最后，更重要的，自然是我们工商业家自己应该用最大的努力，将我们凡是可以拿出的力量，全部拿出来，凡是可以从国内外搜集的资金，尽量去搜集进来，来充裕目前的周转力量，这样庶几乎可以勉力渡过目前的困难阶段，以准备迎接好转的到来。同时我们工商业家必须加紧学习，使我们能彻底了解新民主主义经济的内容与规律，使我们的经营能符合新民主主义经济发展的要求，减少我们因经营与时代脱节所抵消的力量，这样也许能使一分的力量发挥二分的效果，尤其重要的，我们的同业组织必须加强扩大，使同业相互帮助相互合作的效果提高，打下将来计划经济的良好基础。
    我的报告完了。
