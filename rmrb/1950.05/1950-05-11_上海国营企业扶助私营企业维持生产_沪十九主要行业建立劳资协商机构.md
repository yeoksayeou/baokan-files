Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th. Over the eleven months from June of last year to April of this year, state-owned enterprises in Shanghai have played a significant role in supporting private enterprises to maintain production through methods such as processing and ordering. Two-thirds of private textile and dyeing factories in Shanghai have received various forms of assistance from state-owned yarn and cloth companies. As of April 20th, private factories had spun a total of over 22,700 bales of cotton yarn, woven over 795,800 bolts of various types of cloth, and dyed over 130,000 bolts of various colored cloth. The state-owned yarn and cloth company’s short-term orders to private textile factories included over 4,400 bales of cotton yarn and 4,900 bolts of cotton cloth; purchased finished products included over 31,600 bales of cotton yarn and over 1,052,700 bolts of cotton cloth. Department stores commissioned manufacturers to process and produce various daily necessities totaling over 1.4 billion yuan from June of last year to the end of March, with orders exceeding 8.7 billion yuan and sales exceeding 2.2 billion yuan. The Trade Trust Company's sales and purchases of goods totaled over 360 billion yuan by the end of March. From January to the end of March this year, the Grain Company commissioned twelve private flour mills to produce approximately 470,000 bags of various types of flour. In particular, in the most recent two months, the assistance from state-owned enterprises has become an important force in supporting private manufacturers to overcome temporary difficulties and maintain production. For example, all nineteen private steel rolling mills in Shanghai have resumed production due to the ordering assistance from the East China Industrial Department. The Yarn and Cloth Company's commissioned spinning is currently an important reliance for private cotton textile manufacturers in Shanghai to continue to maintain production. State-owned enterprises are also purchasing products from private manufacturers. For example, the East China Yarn and Cloth Company's purchase of yarn and cloth from dozens of private manufacturers from March 29th to 31st was worth over 10 billion yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th. The efforts made by private industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai in the past two months to overcome production and sales difficulties prove that as long as labor and management cooperate and change old management policies and methods, it is entirely possible for general private industrial and commercial enterprises to overcome the current temporary difficulties and thereby guide the future operation and development of private enterprises onto the right path. According to materials from the end of April, labor-management consultation institutions have been established in 19 major industries in Shanghai, including wool spinning, rubber, medicine, and silk weaving, and seven other industries, such as towel blankets, are in preparation. In addition, more than a dozen factories have established labor-management consultation institutions, and the preparation is even more widespread. Through labor-management consultation, the masses of workers in many factories voluntarily reduced wages and actively produced, while the management also adopted a positive attitude, actively raising funds and improving management policies and methods, thereby gradually resolving difficulties. Taking Shanghai Huacheng Cigarette Factory, which has more than 2,000 workers, as an example, due to difficulties in sales and capital turnover, the management proposed a 50% wage reduction to the trade union at the end of February this year, threatening to "eat everything." Later, at the suggestion of the trade union, labor and management organized a labor-management consultation meeting in early March. At the meeting, the labor representatives expressed their willingness to appropriately reduce wages in order to take care of the current production difficulties, and at the same time suggested that the management improve operations, produce more popular products, and save raw materials and other expenses. As a result, even the wage reduction for workers and staff alone reduced the management's monthly expenses by more than 1,000 dan of rice. Under the influence of the labor's sincere assistance in overcoming difficulties, the management also changed its original passive attitude and transferred 2 billion yuan of funds from Hong Kong to continue to maintain production. The private Nanyang Rubber Factory had experienced serious difficulties twice after liberation due to the management's withdrawal of funds for speculation, which led to a forced shutdown in early December last year. At that time, the situation was reversed because workers suggested continuing to improve operations with existing raw materials to maintain production. Although production suffered from insufficient power supply after February this year, due to the efforts of the workers, many workers gave up their annual leave to work harder during the power-on time, which resulted in a 25% increase in weekly output compared to before; the daily output of rubber shoes in March has increased from 2,000 pairs to 3,000 pairs. At the same time, due to the better quality of the finished products, orders have been increasing daily, and production has become profitable. The unpaid annual bonuses and wages from last year have now been fully paid. In April, the labor and management of Rendesa Textile Factory organized a production improvement committee. In order to overcome the current difficulties, the salaries of employees were reduced by one-third, and a savings group was organized to earnestly implement savings. Therefore, although the machinery and equipment are old, the production efficiency of yarn in April has increased from 0.8 pounds per 20 hours per spindle to 0.86 pounds. The factory is now planning to stop weaving 12-pound fine cloth and switch to weaving coarse cloth to meet the needs of the inland market.

In other industries, many manufacturers have been able to continue production by saving expenses and improving operations in various aspects. In addition, some industries, such as the cigarette industry, have implemented joint sales and purchases, which have played a certain role in overcoming production blindness and overcoming current difficulties. In mid-April, ten companies in the cigarette industry participated in the joint sales and purchase organization.

　　上海国营企业扶助私营企业维持生产
　　沪十九主要行业建立劳资协商机构
    【新华社上海十日电】从去年六月到今年四月十一个月中，上海国营企业在用加工定货等方式扶助私营企业维持生产方面起了巨大的作用。上海全市的私营纺染织厂商有三分之二得到了公营花纱布公司的各种扶助。截至今年四月二十日止，私营工厂代纺的棉纱共二万二千七百余件，代织的各种布共七十九万五千八百余匹，代染各种色布十三万余匹。公营花纱布公司向私营纺织厂的短期定货有棉纱四千四百余件，棉布四千九百匹；收购的成品有棉纱三万一千六百余件，棉布一百零五万二千七百余匹。百货公司委托厂商加工代制的各种日用品自去年六月截止三月底止共有十四亿元以上，定货则在八十七亿元以上，代销货物亦在二十二亿元以上。贸易信托公司代销及收购货物截至三月底止共达三千六百亿元以上。粮食公司从今年一月到三月底止，委托十二家私营面粉厂代制的各种面粉约近四十七万袋。特别是最近两月多来，公营企业的扶助，已成为支持私营厂商克服暂时困难维持生产的重要力量。如上海十九家私营轧钢厂即因得到华东工业部的定货扶助而全部恢复了生产。花纱布公司的委托代纺目前也已成为上海私营棉纺织厂商继续维持生产的重要依靠。公营企业对私营厂商产品的收购亦在进行中。如三月二十九日到三十一日三天中，华东花纱布公司收购的数十家私营厂商的纱布，即值一百亿元以上。
    【新华社上海十日电】最近两个月来上海市私营工商业在克服产销困难方面所作的努力，证明只要劳资双方协力，改变旧的经营方针和方法，一般私营工商业完全可能渡过目前的暂时困难，并从而使私营企业今后的经营和发展走入正当的途径。据四月底的材料，上海已有毛纺、橡胶、医药、丝织等十九种主要行业建立了劳资协商的机构，另有毛巾被毯等七个行业正在筹组中。此外各企业已建立劳资协商机构的有十多个工厂，筹组中的更为普遍。经过劳资协商，许多工厂的工人群众自动地降低工资，积极生产，资方也采取积极态度主动筹调资金改善经营方针和方法，从而逐步地解决了困难。以拥有二千多工人的上海华成烟厂为例，由于销路和资金周转发生困难，资方曾于今年二月底向工会提出减薪二分之一的要求，并以“吃光算数”相威胁。以后经过工会提议，三月初劳资双方组织了劳资协商会议。会中劳方代表表示愿意为照顾目前生产困难适当减低工资，同时建议资方改善经营，多出大众化产品，节省原料及其他开支，结果仅因工人职员减薪一项即使资方每月开支减少一千多担米，在劳方诚挚协助克服困难的影响下，资方也改变原来的消极态度，并且从香港调回资金二十亿元，继续维持了生产。私营南洋橡胶厂于解放后曾因资方抽缩资金从事投机，两次发生严重困难，以致到去年十二月初不得不被迫停工。当时由于工人建议以现有原料继续改进经营维持生产，结果扭转了局面。虽然今年二月以后生产遭受到电力供应不足的困难，但因工人的努力，许多工人为争取在有电时间加紧生产而放弃了年假休息，结果使每周产量反较前提高了百分之二十五；三月份日产胶鞋已由每日二千双增到三千双。同时由于成品质量较好，订货日增，生产已有利可图，去年未发清的年奖和工资现已全部发清。仁德纱厂四月份劳资双方组织了生产改进委员会，为克服当前困难，职工薪金减低了三分之一，同时组织节约小组认真实行节约，因而机器设备虽旧，但纱的生产效率四月份中已由每锭二十小时的○点八磅提高到○点八六磅。该厂现并拟停织十二磅细布，改织粗布以适应内地市场需要。
    其他各业中亦有很多厂商由于从各方面节约开支改善经营而使生产得以继续维持。此外有些行业如卷烟业等，则实行联销联购，在克服生产盲目性渡过目前困难中起了一定效果。四月中卷烟业中即有十一家公司参加了联销联购的组织。
