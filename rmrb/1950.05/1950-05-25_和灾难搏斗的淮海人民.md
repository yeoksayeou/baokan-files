　　The Huaihai People Fight Against Disaster
    By our reporter Chen Yongjin
    (I)
    When you step into the severely afflicted disaster area of Huaihai Sub-district in Northern Jiangsu, you will see that the Huaihai people are conquering the disaster left to them by the Kuomintang bandits with the great spirit of supporting the Huaihai Campaign.
    In Xiwu Village, Xiwu Street, in the Hudong District, the most severely affected disaster area in the Huaihai area, Jiang's bandits looted sixteen times, burning down a total of 856 houses, and looting 133 out of 135 livestock in the entire street. A barber named Gao said, "I bought livestock five times, but they were all looted." Thirty-five farmers were taken away from the entire street, and it cost 3,850 silver dollars to get them back. Many people were shot dead, including Li Yuzhu's wife, who was killed by the bandits with bayonets scraping off her breasts before being shot. The people deeply recognize the source of their disaster and harbor boundless resentment towards the enemy—the pawns of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits.
    (II)
    Under the leadership of the People's Government, in every village of the ten counties of Shuyang, Siyang, Xin'an, Huaiyin, Huaibao, Pi-Sui, Suining, Suqian, Lianshui, and Guanyun in the Huaihai area, a surge of production for self-salvation to overcome the famine has been set off. Every cadre, without exception, saves four taels of grain every day for disaster relief. The instruction to grow vegetables to survive the famine has been widely implemented, and even the courtyard of the Commissioner's Office is full of vegetables. Shuyang County had already planted more than 14,000 mu by mid-March. Calculated at 1,000 jin per mu, each disaster victim can get 100 to 200 jin of vegetables. Suining County has planted more than 30,000 mu of vegetables. Siyang's five districts have planted more than 48,900 mu of vegetables. A surge of digging wild vegetables has been set off among the broad masses, actively responding to the call of "save one out of one" and "prepare sunny day vegetables on cloudy days." The 93 members of the Fanzhuang disaster victim production team in Hudong District have all achieved "save one out of two." Tens of thousands of disaster victims in Sijiadang dig lotus seeds every day, with some digging dozens of jin a day. Wu Tongxi, a disaster victim in Xifang Village, saved 160 jin of dried lotus seeds (white in color and sweet in taste, can be made into flour) and 100 jin of fresh lotus seeds in half a month, which can completely guarantee his life during the famine.
    (III)
    The Huaihai area has widely developed various sideline productions such as milling flour, weaving mats, transportation, and spinning. On every road leading to the market town, men and women carry flour racks or push woven mats and straw sandals to the market to sell. Due to the development of sideline production, 30% of the disaster victims' lives can be guaranteed. Shuyang County has 4,913 flour mills, which can support more than 30,000 people. In March, the county's flour mills exchanged more than 287,000 jin of grain. In early April, the reporter saw the situation of the cotton yarn exchange in the streets of Shucheng. From morning to dusk, the exchange was crowded with people. According to the comrades at the exchange, they can receive more than 130 jin of yarn every day. Many disaster victims said: If it weren't for the People's Government helping disaster victims with production to overcome the famine, we would have starved to death long ago.
    (IV)
    This spring, more than 300,000 male and female migrant workers in the Huaihai area are building dikes on the Xin'yi River. In this way, each person can at least guarantee to get 100 jin of grain, and some can get more than 200 to 300 jin. Under the spirit of work relief, the Huaihai people can complete this year's flood prevention task and solve the lives of more than one million disaster victims. The disaster victims said: "Chairman Mao told us to do this, it's really the best thing, taking care of the family, nourishing the body, and also eliminating the flood."
    (V)
    The people who have turned over in the liberated areas can not only withstand the test of war, but also withstand the test of famine. In Yaowei Village, Siyang County, there is a 54-year-old woman named Zhang Shilan. In February, on a snowy day, she was afraid that the disaster victims would freeze to death, so she went to Dingguanzhuang to investigate the disaster. Seeing that the child born by Ding Guanzhi's wife had no clothes to wear, she quickly took off a piece of clothing to wrap the child and mobilized a dou of sorghum to give to Ding's wife. Another time, in her own village, she mobilized a jar of rice to send to disaster victims in Shijiazhuang. On the way, she slipped into a snow ditch and was discovered and pulled out of the ditch after a long time. She said, "It is glorious for me to die for the masses." Her high level of dedication to serving the masses in disaster relief led to her acceptance into the Communist Party by the village's Communist Party branch at her request. Most of the masses in the Huaihai Sub-district have achieved "social mutual assistance" and mutual concern. Communist Party members and Youth League members, due to their exemplary actions, have gained the love of the broad masses. Eight Communist Party members in Juyuan Village, Shuyang County, dug vegetables in the wild and dug more than 50 jin in one day to help the disaster victims. Youth League members in Xifang Village helped disaster victims dig lotus seeds for two days without compensation. The Communist Party branch of Huaji Township in Huaibao County convened a general meeting of party members to specifically assign tasks to help severely affected households grow vegetables, planting more than 200 mu in three days.
    Through county, district, township, and people's representative conferences, many ways of production for self-salvation have been found. The Machang Township People's Representative Conference donated more than 4,000 jin of coarse grain to relieve disaster victims. Under the slogan of mutual relief, the people of Shuyang County raised a total of 800,000 jin of substitute food and 600,000 jin of grain to relieve severely affected households. In addition, the county also resettled more than 4,000 households of disaster victims from neighboring areas. The disaster situation in the Huaihai area has gradually stopped developing under the joint efforts of the Huaihai people. The disaster situation in Shucheng District has begun to alleviate. At the beginning of March, there were 984 households, 3,247 people, without food; 278 households, 780 people, begging for food. By the beginning of April, the numbers were 302 households, 1,207 people, without food; 29 households, 40 people, begging for food.
    While the male laborers participated in the river management, the women actively shouldered the important task of spring plowing and spring planting. In the fields of the Huaihai area, everywhere there are women or young girls engaged in spring planting and fertilization. All seven mutual aid groups in Shuohuo Township are women pulling plows. Zhong Yulan, a female Communist Party member in Fenggou Village, Shuyang County, organized six women to not only help the male workers managing the river to cultivate the land, but also helped Guyao Village to carry out a shock spring planting. According to the statistics of nine counties in Huaihai, more than 65,000 women participated in field cultivation, plowing more than 106,000 mu of land, of which more than 20,000 women gloriously participated in substitute cultivation.
    (VI)
    The boundless wheat fields in the Huaihai area have already grown lovely ears of wheat. The fields of yellow vegetables have already seeded. In Sijiadang and Qingyi Lake, which are known as the Ukrainian of Northern Jiangsu, the scene is even more exciting. It is said that this year the wheat can grow to the height of a person, and each mu can yield 300 to 400 jin. The disaster victims in the Huaihai area are about to overcome the spring famine. Liu Tongxi, a 50-year-old disaster victim in Sunxing Village, said: "If it weren't for the People's Government and the Communist Party, I would have haidala (local dialect meaning dead) this year." Liu Tongxi had just gotten out of bed not long ago. When he was sick, the government sent him more than one jin of wheat every day, and sometimes it also sent him rice. The reporter saw on the blackboards of many villages that they wrote: "The Central People's Government Chairman Mao has sent people to see us again." Sun Rutian, a disaster victim in Yangwan Village, said: "The Communist Party Chairman Mao really cares about us! We will never forget it." The unanimous reflection of the disaster victims in the Huaihai Sub-district: The People's Government's methods of production for self-salvation and work relief have saved us.

　　和灾难搏斗的淮海人民
    本报记者  陈勇进
    （一）
    当你踏进苏北重灾区淮海分区的时候，会使你看到淮海人民，正以支援淮海战役的伟大气魄来征服国民党匪帮留给他们的灾难。
    在淮海区最严重的灾区湖东区西圩村的西圩街，曾经过十六次蒋匪的抢劫，总共烧毁房子八百五十六间，全街一百三十五头牲口被抢去了一百三十三头。一个姓高的剃头匠说：“我连着买了五次牲口，结果都被抢去了。”全街曾经被抓走三十五个农民，用三千八百五十块银元才把人换出来。有很多人被枪杀了，其中李玉珠的老婆是被匪帮们用刺刀将奶子刮掉然后又枪杀的。人民深刻的认识自己灾难的来源，对敌人——美帝国主义的爪牙蒋介石匪帮怀着无边的愤恨。
    （二）
    在人民政府的领导下，淮海区的沭阳、泗阳、新安、淮阴、淮宝、邳睢、睢宁、宿迁、涟水、灌云等十县的每个村庄，都掀起了生产自救战胜灾荒的热潮。每个干部都无例外的每日节余四两粮食，进行救灾。种菜渡荒的指示已普遍执行，连专员公署的院子里也种满了蔬菜。沭阳县在三月中旬即已种上一万四千余亩。按每亩收一千斤计算，每个灾民可合到一百斤到二百斤的菜。睢宁县已种菜三万亩以上。泗阳五个区即种菜四万八千九百余亩。广大群众中掀起了挖野菜的热潮，积极地响应着“挖一余一”“阴天准备晴天菜”的号召。湖东区范庄灾民生产小组九十三人，都作到“挖一余二”。司家荡每天都有上万的灾民挖芙子，有的人一天可挖几十斤。西坊村灾民吴同喜，在半月中剩下干芙子（色白有甜味可做粉）一百六十斤，鲜芙子一百斤，可以完全保证灾荒中的生活。
    （三）
    淮海区广泛地开展了磨粉、织席、运输、纺织等各种副业生产，在每条通向集镇的道路上，男的女的挑着粉架或推着织成的席子草鞋等到集上出卖。由于副业生产的发展，百分之三十的灾民生活可得到保障。沭阳县有四千九百一十三家粉坊，可以养活三万多人。三月份全县粉坊共换回粮食二十八万七千余斤。四月上旬，记者在沭城的大街上看到花纱交换所的情形。交换所从早晨到黄昏，门市部都挤满着人。据交换所的同志告诉记者，他们每天可收到纱一百三十多斤。不少灾民都说：要不是人民政府帮助灾民生产渡荒，我们早就饿死了。
    （四）
    今春淮海区有三十余万男女民工在新沂河上筑堤。这样每人至少可以保证落得一百斤粮，有的可落到二百多斤到三百斤。在以工代赈的精神下，淮海人民可以完成今年防水的任务，并且可以解决百余万灾民的生活。灾民说：“毛主席叫咱们这样作，真是再好也没有了，顾了家，养了身，还除了水患。”
    （五）
    解放区翻了身的人民，不但经得起战争的考验，同时亦经得起灾荒的考验。泗阳县姚圩村，有一个五十四岁的妇女，名叫张士兰。在二月里一个风雪交加的日子里，她怕灾民冻死，到丁贯庄去查灾，看见丁贯芝的老婆生下的孩子没衣穿，即忙脱下一件衣服把小孩包住，又到别家动员了一斗高粮给了丁大嫂。还有一次，她在自己的村子里，动员了一罐饭送给史家庄灾民，在路上被滑到雪沟里，很久才被人发现，把她从沟里拉出来。她说：“为了群众就是我死了也是光荣的。”她在救灾中高度的表现为群众服务的精神，在她的要求下，村里中共支部接受她为共产党员。淮海分区的群众，大部分都作到了“社会互济”与互相关切。共产党员与青年团员由于他们的模范行动，更获得广大群众的爱戴。沭阳县菊元村八个共产党员到野地里挖菜，一天即挖五十多斤用以救济灾民。西坊村青年团员无代价的帮助灾民挖了两天芙子。淮宝县花集乡的中共支部召开了党员大会，具体分工帮助重灾户种菜，三天内即种了二百多亩。
    各地通过县、区、乡、人民代表会议，找出了很多的生产自救办法。马厂乡人民代表会捐募四千余斤粗粮救济灾民。沭阳县人民在互相救济的口号下，共募得八十万斤代食品、六十万斤粮食救济了重灾户。此外，该县并安置友邻地区的灾民四千余户。淮海地区灾情在淮海人民共同努力下，已逐渐的停止发展。沭城区灾情已开始减轻。三月初该区断炊者九百八十四户，三千二百四十七人；讨饭者二百七十八户，七百八十人。到四月初，断炊者为三百零二户，一千二百零七人；讨饭者二十九户，四十人。
    男劳动力参加了治河，妇女们便积极地负担了春耕春种的重大任务，在淮海区的田野里，到处都是妇女或者年轻的女孩子在进行春种与施肥。硕湖乡的七个互助组全是妇女拉耧。沭阳县凤沟村的女共产党员仲玉兰，组织了六个妇女除帮助治河的男工种地外，还帮助顾窑村进行突击春种。据淮海九个县的统计，即有六万五千余妇女参加田间耕作，刨地十万六千余亩，其中有两万多妇女光荣地参加了代耕。
    （六）
    淮海区一望无际的麦田，已经长出了可爱的麦穗。遍野的黄菜，已经结籽。在被称为苏北乌克兰的司家荡、清衣湖里，景象更是令人兴奋的。据说今年麦子能长到一人高，每亩可收到三百斤到四百多斤。淮海区的灾民，即将渡过春荒。孙行村一个五十多岁的灾民刘同喜说：“要不是人民政府与共产党，我今年就海答啦（当地土话即死了的意思）。”刘同喜是不久前才从床上爬起来的，在他病时，政府每天发给他一斤多麦子，有时还发给他大米。记者在很多村子的黑板报上，看到他们写道：“中央人民政府毛主席又派人来看咱们了。”杨弯村灾民孙如田说：“共产党毛主席真关心咱们！永远也忘不了。”淮海分区灾民一致的反映：人民政府生产自救、以工代赈的办法，救活了咱们。
