　　The Voice of Truth
    Labin, Deputy Chairman of the Radio Broadcasting Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union
    The Soviet people should be proud: our motherland's genius, Popov, brought the world the greatest invention, creating a new era in the development of science, technology, and culture. The Soviet people should also be proud that our Soviet socialist motherland makes radio serve the interests of the people, ensures the rapid development of radio technology, and guarantees its widest application in various fields of national cultural life and the people's economy.
    In our country, radio was initially used as a tool for broadcasting the most important government decrees. On October 6, 1917, the order of the Revolutionary Military Committee was broadcast through the radio station of the cruiser "Aurora." This was the first attempt by the proletariat using radio in an armed uprising. Radio connected the Revolutionary Military Committee with all parties and ensured a united resistance against various attempts by the Provisional Government to transport counter-revolutionary forces to Petrograd. On the morning of November 7, the radio broadcast Lenin's "Appeal to the Citizens of Russia," announcing the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution. This was the world's first radio broadcast to the people.
    In the struggle against imperialist wars and for peaceful construction, the Soviet state widely used radio. Lenin said in October 1917: "We have received news that our radio telegrams have reached Europe... We may establish radio communication with Paris, and when the peace treaty is signed, we will be able to tell the French people: the treaty will be signed, and with the strength of the French people, an armistice can be concluded within two hours. Then we shall see what Clemenceau will say."
    Thus, with the help of radio, the Soviet state bypassed the rulers of the bourgeois countries and called on the people of Europe to defend the cause of peace.
    On January 22, 1918, radio broadcast a statement written by Lenin, refuting rumors spread by foreign newspapers and stating the situation in the Soviet Union and the decrees of the Soviet government. These statements were broadcast by radio more than once. They exposed the slanders of bourgeois newspapers and magazines and conveyed the truth opened up by the state of the worker-peasant alliance. The Soviet state was the first in the world to use radio to consolidate international and cultural relations. On November 22, 1919, Lenin sent congratulations via radio to the government of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and pointed out the necessity of regular radio contact between Moscow and Budapest. In 1920, a test broadcast from Moscow to the residents of Berlin was successful, but it is worth noting that the broadcast from Berlin to Moscow was not successful because German radio technology was not as advanced as that of the Soviet Union.
    The success of Soviet radio technology and radio broadcasting is inseparable from the names of Lenin and Stalin. In a letter from Lenin to Stalin on May 19, 1922 (which was first published on January 21, 1949), he wrote:
    "...The possibility of broadcasting the living language of mankind by radio over long distances can be fully realized under our technical conditions; manufacturing millions of radios to broadcast speeches, reports, and lectures delivered in Moscow to many other places in the republic hundreds or even thousands of versts away from Moscow, is also something that can be achieved under certain conditions."
    Lenin attached great importance to the realization of this plan. He wrote: "...Under no circumstances should money be spared in thoroughly completing the radio telephone communication business and manufacturing truly applicable loudspeakers." In this letter, Lenin specially allocated 100,000 gold rubles outside the budget to install loudspeakers and radios. Lenin called radio a newspaper without paper and without distance. Lenin said: "With radio, all of Russia will hear the newspapers read aloud in Moscow."
    During Lenin's lifetime, radio broadcasting had already achieved great success. As early as the end of 1919, the radio station in Nizhny Novgorod had broadcast vivid speeches and music, which were received by Moscow and other cities. In 1920, a 3.5-kilowatt radio station, the largest at the time, was built on Khodynka Square in Moscow. It should be noted that all foreign radio broadcasts started later than those in the Soviet Union. In 1921, radio test broadcasts were carried out by Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan, and other cities. In the same year, radio loudspeakers appeared on the streets of Moscow, and Muscovites heard the spoken news of "Rosta" (Russian Telegraph Agency), popular lectures, and speeches by celebrities. On the fifth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Moscow broadcast many musical programs to a wide range of residents.
    In our country, regular and extensive radio broadcasting began twenty-five years ago, on a scale previously unknown in any country. The powerful radio station named after Comintern broadcast a wide variety of programs every day, including news, radio speeches, lectures, forums, concerts broadcast from the Bolshoi Theatre and the Hall of Unions, musical programs from the Drama Institute, and literary broadcasts.
    Under Stalin's leadership, Lenin's plan for developing radio was gradually realized. During the first five-year plan in the Soviet Union, a solid foundation was created for the smooth development of the radio industry, and a network of radio stations and radio substations spread throughout the country.
    Currently, radio broadcasting in our country is conducted in eighty national languages. Powerful radio stations broadcast the voice of Moscow to every corner of our motherland. All union republics and most autonomous republics, border regions, and states have radio stations for local broadcasting.
    Radio broadcasting in our country is a powerful tool for educating the broad masses of people politically, ideologically, and culturally. It constantly penetrates into the lives of the Soviet people and becomes an indispensable part of the overall system of people's education, a source of political news, and a tool for cultural entertainment.
    Kalinin said: "In terms of its scope and mass character, radio can be said to be the most powerful tool of propaganda and agitation." Soviet radio, like Soviet newspapers and magazines, is a powerful collective propagandist, mass agitator, and organizer. Millions of people listen to political news on the radio—daily reports on international events and on the new achievements of labor, science, and culture in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    The "Latest News" broadcast by radio, like the daily newspapers, has become an indispensable part of the lives of millions of Soviet people. Soviet radio is truly a forum for the people. Central and local radio stations broadcast hundreds of speeches by ordinary Soviet people every day. In our country, it is a very common practice to listen to the broadcast speeches of workers, collective farm members, teachers, scholars, and writers on the radio. In our opinion, this is very natural: radio time is not bought and sold, and anyone who has something useful and educational to talk about from their experience of labor and life can speak very freely and without restraint in front of the microphone. To compare Soviet radio broadcasting with that of capitalist countries, it is worth noting that in the United States, one speech on any radio station costs an average of fifteen to twenty thousand US dollars. Soviet radio has long been free from any commercial interests and influences. The mission of radio in our country is everything for the benefit of the people.
    Soviet radio broadcasting serves the noble purpose of educating the people. It is already common for our radio to broadcast short lectures, forums, and articles in various fields of knowledge. Famous scholars and scientific workers enthusiastically give radio lectures. Radio broadcasts lectures from the Political and Scientific Knowledge Popularization Association. People of all professions can listen to useful knowledge for themselves on the radio. Radio answers listeners' questions on Marxist-Leninist theory, international life, natural science and technology, literature, art, and specialized knowledge in the field of agricultural technology. The so-called specific radio programs for farmers, forestry workers, rural youth, and others have a high reputation among the residents.
    Our radio conducts great educational work among children. Radio programs for children occupy a very important position in Soviet radio broadcasting. In an engaging and interesting way, radio broadcasts stimulate children's desire for knowledge and help families and schools educate the younger generation.
    Soviet radio extensively popularizes the musical art of all Soviet nationalities. Classical music from Russia and Western Europe, as well as outstanding works by Soviet composers, are broadcast on the radio. Every day, the Soviet people can hear the performances of the country's most outstanding musicians and the best musical groups on the radio. Radio stations have first-class orchestras and excellent choirs. The Soviet state grants the Radio Committee the right to freely broadcast any staged plays and concerts from all theaters and concert halls in the country. No radio in any capitalist country can enjoy such rights.
    Soviet radio introduces to listeners the best dramas staged in Moscow theaters and the creations of other city's theatrical troupes. Literary broadcasts, lectures on literary cultivation, prospects of literary magazines, book reviews, and musical broadcasts are widely welcomed.
    The cultural and political questions raised by Soviet listeners are rapidly increasing. The task facing Soviet radio broadcasting workers is to implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee on improving the content of political, musical, and children's broadcast programs, and to quickly eliminate the shortcomings existing in central and local radio broadcasting.
    Soviet radio is closely connected with its listeners, which is a characteristic of our radio. The All-Union Radio Committee receives hundreds of letters from radio listeners every day, and local radio committees also conduct large-scale correspondence with listeners. The vast majority of letters are used in radio broadcasts (music commentary, question-and-answer, letter summaries, etc.). Listeners' letters contain valuable instructions, suggestions, and criticisms for improving radio broadcasting. These letters reflect the Soviet listeners' keen concern for the quality of radio broadcasting. Therefore, radio broadcasting workers are required to take a cautious attitude towards listeners' criticisms and more fully answer the increasing number of questions raised by the people.
    This progressive significance and noble goal that radio has in the Soviet socialist country is not available and impossible in any capitalist country.
    In all capitalist countries, radio broadcasting serves the interests of the greedy bourgeoisie. Its mission is to deceive the people, embellish the bourgeois way of life, conceal extremely sharp social contradictions, and spread the social fallacy of the "unity of interests" between capitalists and workers. The reactionary bourgeois radio advocates war mania and spreads rumors and slanders about countries where the people have seized power.
    Soviet radio broadcasting promotes the most advanced ideas of mankind. It cultivates the sentiment of Soviet patriotism, the sentiment of love and loyalty to its motherland, to the great Lenin-Stalin Party that ensured the victory of socialism in our country. Soviet radio broadcasting reflects the unbreakable friendship between all nationalities in our country and the deep and sincere respect for the national cultures of all Soviet nationalities. Soviet radio broadcasting serves the noble internationalist goals and the cause of consolidating friendship among the people of all countries. Soviet radio broadcasts the voice of Moscow to the world, which is the voice of the pioneers striving for lasting peace and friendship among all nations.
    Moscow's external radio broadcasts are currently conducted in thirty languages. The people of all countries listen to the voice of Moscow as a source of infinitely believed truth. Through the barbaric howls of rumors and slanders, through the hysterical cries of war instigators, the calm and true voice of Moscow spreads to the people on all continents, inspiring the people's front with the power and invincible courage and confidence to fight for peace.
    Every day, hundreds of letters are sent to Moscow from every corner of the earth, which proves that the voice of Moscow penetrates the hearts of millions of ordinary people.
    Radio listener José Ramón Hagem from Venezuela in South America wrote: "...We pay very close attention to the international commentary programs. We truly realize how different the radio broadcasts of imperialism and the radio broadcasts of Moscow are: the former emits cries of 'destruction and barbarism,' while the latter spreads the authoritative language of peace and happiness for mankind. The radio broadcasts of Moscow fill us with pride and joy. Therefore, we believe that fighting in the ranks of the international front is a glorious cause for all peace-loving people. We live in a semi-colony of American and British imperialism and fight for peace. No matter what the war mongers who sell human disasters and poverty demand, we are convinced that the correct peace policy of the world's progressive forces will definitely win. Here in Venezuela, we listen to the broadcasts of the Moscow Central Broadcasting Station with reverence and longing."
    Radio listener Ms. Inka Ivkovich from Gera, Germany, started her letter with two lines from the Soviet "March of the Motherland": "I have never seen another country that can breathe so freely!" She continued: "I hope that your truth will grab the hearts of all people, and for all of us, life is meaningless without this truth... Lenin was the first to open up this remarkable success of thought. He called on people to follow him! Under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet people have achieved new successes. Stalin is full of joy because he knows that he is making happiness concrete, and this happiness will surely win throughout the world."
    Sved Edwin, Ludkevis, from Vesterås wrote: "Here you have many listeners, and in the face of capitalist dictatorship, your broadcast clearly shows the superiority of great socialism. I am excited to await the day when capitalism becomes a past phenomenon."
    An Englishman, De Geem, wrote about Soviet radio broadcasting: "You are engaged in an excellent work, spreading the truth of your great struggle for peace and liberation of the people oppressed by dying capitalism."
    Another British listener said: "I think your broadcast has important significance and is an effective tool. Thank you for making the most beautiful and progressive ideas of mankind known to the majority of the world." (Alan Thompson, Lancashire)
    Moscow Radio also has many listeners in the United States. However, the letters of American listeners encounter the iron gate of letter censorship. In the letters of American listeners, they request that their names and addresses not be mentioned in the broadcast. This terror in front of the Un-American Activities Investigation Agency clearly reflects the police system of American imperialism.
    But the truth cannot be banned. In the radio century, it is impossible to hide from the people the truth about the peace-loving foreign policy of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, just as it is impossible to hide from the people the insidious aggressive plans of American monopoly capitalists who are trying to earn tens of billions of dollars in new wars.
    A common worker in Canada wrote in his letter:
    "We love Moscow's radio broadcasts because they correctly explain the international situation in the world, especially in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. We hear real news from your radio broadcasts, and we are very happy."
    In the letter he continued: "When the great Soviet writer Gorky was born, you broadcast Gorky's short story 'The City of the Yellow Devil' after his visit to the United States in 1906. I have never read or heard anyone talk about this story. I heard it for the first time from you (and I am already forty-two years old). When I heard this excellent novel written by the great Gorky describing the great capitalists of the United States from you, you simply cannot imagine how moved I was. What a smart question and what a stupid answer: Gorky asked: 'What do you think of art?' The big capitalist replied: 'I didn't think about it, I bought it.' The big capitalist also had the same idea about Gorky's question about science. And the big capitalist only told one truth: he makes money to make more money with this money. Just keep earning to infinity. This is exactly the way big capitalists in Canada and the United States make money now. They use money to make atomic bombs so that they can use atomic bombs to massacre peace-loving people. Although there are many radio stations in Canada and the United States, almost 95% of them broadcast extremely ugly nonsense. There is not a bit of truth in their broadcasts."
    The bought-off American radio stations fulfill the will of their masters and carry out crazy war propaganda. Some of the largest American radio companies have long been colluded with the yellow newspaper trusts Hearst, McCormick, and Scripps Howard. American radio, like American newspapers and magazines, is completely controlled by American monopoly capital. Every hour and every minute in American radio broadcasting is bought by industrial and commercial trusts. Many advertising companies act as intermediaries between radio stations and industrial and commercial monopolists. Advertising companies control broadcast playwrights, broadcast directors, and actors, sign contracts with movie stars, and buy off broadcast observers and broadcast critics. The direct purpose of American radio broadcasting is to arouse the need for increased production and commodities of the trusts and companies that buy radio station time. Rudolf Arnheim, an editor of Columbia University's radio lectures, wrote: "In American radio broadcasting, all means are permitted to increase commodity needs, and the greatest need is guaranteed by the most barbaric means."
    Standard American broadcast dramas and broadcast scripts are extremely incompetent and low-level. American radio broadcasts are nothing more than stories of sexual desire and crime, vulgar jazz music, and lying rumors.
    In the field of radio technology, the American scientist Lee de Forest, famous for his inventions, wrote in a report to the National Radio Broadcasting Association: "Stories describing murder and crime dominate the sky every night, and children become psychiatric patients because they have listened to your stories before going to bed."
    In the early days of American radio broadcasts, educational broadcast time was allocated, but commercial broadcasts quickly squeezed them out. Frank Hill wrote in a book published in New York in 1942: "Radio broadcasting has become more and more low-level... The radio station restricts freedom of speech and gives educational broadcasts a very small amount of time that is inconvenient for listeners, and this time is completely determined by commercial considerations. Big businessmen quickly squeezed out educational broadcasts."
    Since then, American radio has become the inseparable property of big capitalists. One of the American radio "theorists," a "professor" named Hoffman, confidently said: "Listeners do not want to become educated people, they want to entertain themselves"... But at the same time, Hoffman made his thoughts clearer, saying: "More correctly, it is not 'interest,' but only 'attracting listeners from daily life.'"
    Of course, the purpose of American radio broadcasting is by no means limited to broadcasting advertisements. Radio stations and advertising companies work for the money of American monopoly capitalists, and what American monopoly capitalists are most interested in is fooling the people and diverting them from the sharp problems of American reality. The decadent American radio broadcasting reflects the decline of bourgeois culture. It serves the despicable purposes of war instigators who obediently carry out the will of Wall Street and carry out false propaganda. American radio tries its best to praise the so-called "American way of life," promote fascist ideas about American racial superiority, provoke emotions between "pure" Americans and black people and other nationalities, and slander all advanced causes.
    With the help of the "Marshall Plan," American monopoly capital plundered a dozen radio stations in Europe and made the radio broadcasts in all Marshallized countries subordinate to the sphere of American influence. For example, radio broadcasting in Australia is completely controlled by Americans. The US State Department cheaply bought all the best time on Australian radio stations to carry out the rumor broadcasts of the "Voice of America."
    American planes send prepared broadcast recording tapes from the United States to Italy every day. Americans also control French radio broadcasts. Not long ago, the French magazine "Radio Forum" wrote: "The singing of American jazz music occupies a very large position in French radio programs, and at the same time, the broadcast is carried out under the leadership of American 'experts.' These broadcasts broadcast the so-called 'Mister Chui brushes his teeth with a special thing and is not afraid of the Bolsheviks.'"
    In this way, along with cigarettes and special toothpaste, American monopoly capitalists are trying to force their misanthropic ideas on the people of France and other countries, trying to provoke them to hate everything advanced and progressive. According to the evaluation of the magazine "Radio Forum," American interference in French radio broadcasting has turned French radio into a tool for preparing for war.
    With US dollars, you can buy time on radio stations in European Marshallized countries, and you can also buy radio stations in their entirety. In those countries, traitorous governments sell their country's independence and honor for US dollars. There you can also buy broadcast commentators and broadcast directors, but no amount of money can buy the people. The people of Marshallized countries know how much the radio broadcasts bought by American monopoly capitalists are worth, and they firmly avoid it.
    A radio listener from Vaucluse, France, wrote: "You certainly know that French radio is inciting anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiment. It broadcasts false or distorted news all day long in order to expand the division among the working people. Our radio silences all domestic and foreign news that is beneficial to the French working people. Therefore, we are very happy to listen to Moscow's broadcasts because Moscow's radio broadcasts exactly the news that our radio hides from French listeners."
    Hundreds of such letters can prove the weakness of the Americanized broadcasts that deceive listeners in European countries. The working people of Europe clearly know the source of truth and adjust their radios to the frequency band of Moscow Radio.
    Soviet radio spreads Stalin's ideas of friendly cooperation among all nations to the world and defends the cause of peace. Through all obstacles, through rumors and slanders, Soviet radio deeply imprints the invincible belief of the people's front in the struggle for peace and democracy into the hearts of millions of ordinary people.

　　真理的声音
    苏联部长会议无线电广播委员会代主席  拉宾
    苏联人民应当感到骄傲：我们祖国天才的波波夫给世界带来最伟大的发明，在科学、技术、文化的发展中创造了新的纪元。苏联人民同样应当感到骄傲的是：我们苏维埃社会主义祖国使无线电为人民的利益服务，保证了无线电技术迅速的发展，并保证了它在国家文化生活和人民经济的多种领域中最广泛的应用。
    在我们国内，无线电最初是用来广播最重要政令的工具。一九一七年十月六日，通过巡洋舰“曙光”号的无线电台，广播了革命军事委员会的命令，这是武装起义的无产阶级使用无线电的第一次尝试。无线电使革命军事委员会和各方面联系起来，并且对临时政府向彼得堡输送反革命力量的各种企图，保证了团结一致的抵抗。十一月七日早晨，无线电广播了列宁写的《告俄罗斯公民书》，宣告了伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利。这是世界上第一次向着人民的无线电广播。
    在反对帝国主义战争和争取和平建设的斗争中，苏维埃国家广泛的使用了无线电。列宁在一九一七年十月说：“我们得到这样的消息：我们的无线电报到达欧洲……我们可能与巴黎建立无线电报联络，而当和平条约签订时，我们将有可能告诉法国人民：条约是会签字的，靠着法国人民的力量，两小时内就可以缔结停战协定。到那时我们看一看克列曼索将要说些什么。”
    苏维埃国家就这样靠着无线电的帮助，越过资产阶级国家统治者的头顶，号召欧洲人民保卫和平事业。
    一九一八年一月二十二日，无线电广播了列宁写的文告，文告中驳斥了外国报纸造谣的消息，并申述了苏维埃国内的情况和苏维埃政府的法令。这些文告不只一次地由无线电广播出去，它们揭露了资产阶级报纸刊物的诽谤，传达了工农联盟国家开创的真理。苏维埃国家是世界上第一个用无线电来巩固国际和文化关系的。一九一九年十一月二十二日，列宁通过无线电向匈牙利苏维埃共和国政府致贺，并指出莫斯科与布达佩斯间经常以无线电联络的必要性。在一九二○年，莫斯科对柏林居民的无线电广播试播成功了，但值得注意的是：由柏林向莫斯科的广播没有成功，因为德国的无线电技术没有苏联这样完善。
    苏维埃无线电技术和无线电广播的成功，是与列宁、斯大林的名字分不开的。在一九二二年五月十九日，列宁给斯大林的信里（该信于一九四九年一月二十一日初次发表）写道：
    “……在远距离以内，用无线电广播人类活生生的语言的可能性，在我们的技术条件下完全可以实现；制造千万个收音机，使在莫斯科发表的演说、报告、讲座播送到远离莫斯科数百俄里，在某种条件下，甚至数千俄里的全共和国其他许多地方去，同样也是可以实现的事。”
    列宁异常重视这个计划的实现，他写道：“……无论在任何情况下，在彻底完成无线电话通讯事业，并制造真正适用的扩音器方面，不应该吝惜金钱。”就在这封信中，列宁在预算以外特别拨出十万金卢布，用来装置扩音器和收音机，列宁将无线电叫做不用纸和没有距离的报纸。列宁说：“靠着无线电，全俄罗斯将要听到在莫斯科朗读的报纸。”
    在列宁生前，无线电广播就已经获得巨大的成功。早在一九一九年年底，尼日尼·诺弗哥罗德的无线电台，就已经广播了生动的演讲和音乐，这些广播都被莫斯科和其他城市收听到了。一九二○年在莫斯科霍登斯基广场上，建设了一个在当时是世界上最大的三·五基罗瓦特的无线电台，要知道所有外国的无线电广播都比苏联开办得晚。在一九二一年，由莫斯科、尼日·诺弗哥罗德、喀桑和其他城市实行了无线电试播。同年，在莫斯科各街道上，都出现了无线电扩音器，于是莫斯科人听到了“罗斯达”（俄罗斯通讯社）的口语报、通俗讲座和名人讲演。在伟大的十月社会主义革命五周年纪念日，莫斯科对广大的各阶层居民广播了许多音乐节目。
    在我们的国家里，二十五年以前就开始了正规的广泛的无线电广播，这种规模在那时以前是任何一个国家所不知道的。以郭民捷命名的强有力的无线电台，每天播送着多种多样的节目，这些节目中包括新闻、广播演说、讲座、座谈会、由大戏院和联盟大厦的大厅转播的音乐会、戏剧研究所的音乐节目以及文艺广播等等。
    在斯大林领导下，发展无线电的列宁计划被逐步地实现着。在苏联第一个五年计划期间，为顺利发展无线电工业创造了坚固的基础，全国遍布无线电台和无线电分站网。
    目前在我们国内无线电广播以八十种民族语言进行着。各强大的广播电台将莫斯科的声音传播到我们祖国的各个角落，所有联盟共和国和大多数自治共和国，边区和州都有对当地广播的无线电台。
    我们国内的无线电广播，是在政治思想和文化上教育广大人民的有力工具。它不断地深入到苏联人民的生活中，并且成为人民教育总体系中不可缺少的部分，成为政治新闻的泉源和文化娱乐的工具。
    加里宁说过：“就其范围，就其群众性来说，无线电可以说是宣传和鼓动的最有力的工具”。苏联的无线电，和苏联的报纸杂志一样，是强有力的集体宣传者，群众的鼓动者和组织者。千百万人由无线电收听政治新闻——关于国际事件的每日报道，关于苏联和各人民民主国家的劳动，科学和文化的新成就。
    由无线电广播的《最后消息》，和每天的报纸一样，成为千百万苏联人民生活中不可缺少的部分。苏联的无线电真正是人民的讲坛。中央和地方的广播电台每天播送着数百次的普通苏联人的讲演。在我国的广播中收听工人、集体农庄庄员、教师、学者、作家的广播讲演，乃是十分普遍的习惯现象。在我们看来这是非常自然的事：广播电台的时间没有被买卖，任何一个人，从劳动和生活的经验中有些什么有益的和有教育性的东西要谈一谈，就可以非常自由地毫无拘束地在麦克风前演讲。为了将苏联和资本主义国家的无线电广播加以比较，值得注意的是：在美国任何一个广播电台的一次讲演，平均要出价一万五千到两万美元。苏联的无线电早已摆脱了任何商业的利益和影响。我们国内无线电的使命是一切为了人民的利益。
    苏联的无线电广播为教育人民的高尚目的服务。我们的无线电播送着简短的讲座、座谈会、以及各种知识部门的文章已经是常见的事了。著名的学者和科学工作者热情地举行广播讲演。无线电播送着政治和科学知识普及协会的讲座。各种职业的人们都可以从无线电广播中收听到对自己有用的知识。无线电回答着听众的问题，这些问题涉及到马列主义理论，国际生活，自然科学和技术问题、文学、艺术、农业技术范围内的专门知识等。对农民，对林业工人，对乡村青年和其他的所谓特定广播节目，在居民中有着很高的威信。
    我们的无线电在儿童中间进行伟大的教育工作。对儿童广播节目，在苏联无线电广播中占很重要的位置。无线电广播以引人入胜的有趣味的形式，启发儿童的求知欲，并且帮助家庭和学校教育年青的一代。
    苏维埃无线电，广泛地普及着苏联各民族的音乐艺术。从无线电中播送着俄罗斯和西欧的古典音乐，以及苏联作曲家的优秀作品。苏联人民每天可以从无线电中听到国内最出色的音乐演奏家和最好的音乐团体的演奏。无线电台拥有第一流的管弦乐队和出色的合唱团。苏维埃国家将这样的权利赋予无线电委员会：从国内所有的戏院与音乐厅，可以自由转播任何上演的戏剧和音乐会。无论那一个资本主义国家内的无线电都不可能享有这样的权利。
    苏联无线电，将莫斯科各戏院上演的最好的戏剧和其他城市各剧团的创作，介绍给听众。文学作品广播，文艺修养讲座，文艺杂志展望，图书评介，音乐作品广播等获得普遍欢迎。
    苏联听众在文化和政治上提出的质问迅速地增加着。摆在苏联无线电广播工作者面前的任务，就是执行党中央委员会关于改进政治的、音乐和儿童的广播节目内容的指示，迅速消灭中央和地方无线电广播中存在的缺点。
    苏联无线电与自己的听众密切地联系着，这是我们的无线电所具有的特点。全苏联无线电委员会每天都接到千百封无线电听众的来信，地方无线电委员会也同样与听众进行着大规模的通信联络。绝大多数的信被用于无线电广播中（音乐解说、问题解答、来信摘要及其他）。听众的来信，具有对改进无线电广播的宝贵指示、建议和批评。这些来信反映出苏联听众对无线电广播质量的敏锐的关心。因此要求无线电广播工作者对听众的批评采取慎重的态度，更完满地回答人民提出的日益增多的质问。
    无线电在苏维埃社会主义国家内所具有的这种进步的意义，这种高尚的目标，是任何一个资本主义国家内所没有也不可能有的。
    在所有资本主义国家里，无线电广播是为贪婪的资产阶级的利益服务的。它的使命是欺骗人民，点缀资产阶级的生活方式，掩饰异常尖锐的社会矛盾，散布资本家与工人“利益一致”的社会谬论。反动的资产阶级的无线电鼓吹着战争狂，散播着对于人民掌握了政权的国家的谣言和诽谤。
    苏联的无线电广播宣传着人类最先进的思想。它培养着苏维埃爱国主义的情感，培养着对自己祖国，对保证了社会主义在我国获得胜利的伟大列宁斯大林党的热爱和忠实的情感。苏联无线电广播反映出我国各民族间牢不可破的友谊，反映出对苏联各族的民族文化的深切而真诚的尊重。苏联无线电广播为高尚的国际主义目的，为巩固各国人民间友谊的事业服务。苏联无线电在全世界传播着莫斯科的声音，这是争取各民族间持久和平与友谊的先导者的声音。
    莫斯科的对外无线电广播，在目前以三十种语言进行。世界各国的人民，当做无限信仰的真理的泉源，倾听着莫斯科的声音。穿过谣言和诽谤的野蛮的叫嚣，穿过战争挑拨者的神经质的号泣，莫斯科的稳重而真实的声音传播给所有大陆上的人民，鼓舞起人民阵线对争取和平的威力和不可战胜的勇气和信心。
    每天从地球各个角落有千百封信寄来莫斯科，这证明莫斯科的声音深入到千百万普通人的心里。
    无线电收听者霍捷·拉蒙·哈杰姆，从南美洲委内瑞拉的来信写道：“……我们非常注意地收听国际论评节目。我们真正认识到帝国主义的无线电广播和莫斯科的无线电广播是如何的不同：前者发出“毁灭和野蛮”的叫嚣，后者传播着人类和平和幸福的权威的语言。莫斯科的无线电广播使我们充满骄傲和喜悦，因此，我们认为在国际阵线的行列中斗争，是对于一切爱好和平人民的光荣事业。我们在美英帝国主义的半殖民地里生活着并为和平斗争着。不管那些贩卖人类的灾难和贫穷的战争贩子们是怎样的要求，但我们确信世界进步力量正确的和平政策一定胜利。在这里，在委内瑞拉，我们怀抱着奠敬和热望倾听莫斯科中央广播电台的播音”。
    无线电收听者尹卡·依夫科维奇女士，从德国格拉城的来信是用苏联《祖国进行曲》中的两句歌词开始的：“我没有见过别的国家，可以这样自由呼吸！”她继续写道：“我希望你们的真理抓住了一切人的心，而对于我们大家，如果没有这种真理生活就没有意义……列宁首先开创了这种思想的显著成功，他号召人们跟着他走！在斯大林领导下，苏联人民获得了新的成功。斯大林满怀愉快，因为他知道，他在把幸福具体化起来，而这幸福一定在全世界上获得胜利。”
    史维德·艾德文、刘德克维斯，从威斯得来斯的来信说：“在这里你们有许多听众，而在资本主义专政的面前，你们的广播十分清楚地显示出伟大的社会主义的优越性。我激动地等待着资本主义成为过去现象的那一天。”
    英国人德热姆关于苏联的无线电广播写道：“你们在从事一种卓越的工作，散布着你们争取和平与解放被垂死的资本主义压迫下的人们的伟大斗争的真理。”
    另外一位英国听者说：“我认为你们的广播有重要的意义，并且是有效的工具，感谢它将人类最美好最进步的思想为全世界的大多数人所周知。”（阿兰·汤姆逊·兰开夏）
    莫斯科的无线电在美国也有许多听众。但是美国听众的信碰到书信检查的铁门。在美国听众的信里，他们请求不要在广播中提到他们的姓名，不要引用他们的住址。在非美活动调查机关面前的这种恐怖，明显地反映出美帝国主义的警察制度。
    但真理是不能被禁止的，在无线电世纪中，将苏联和人民民主国家爱好和平外交政策的真理，对人民隐藏起来是不可能的。正如企图在新战争中获得数十亿美元的美国独占资本家的阴险的侵略计划，不可能对人民隐藏起来一样。
    加拿大的一个普通工人在自己的信里写道：
    “我们喜爱莫斯科的无线电广播，因为它们正确地阐明了全世界、尤其是苏联和人民民主国家中的国际情况。从你们的无线电广播中，我们听到真实的消息，我们是非常高兴的。”
    在信中他继续说：“当伟大的苏维埃作家高尔基诞辰的时候，你们广播了高尔基在一九○六年访问美国之后写的短篇小说《黄色魔鬼的城市》。我从来没有读过也没有听任何人说起过这篇小说。我第一次从你们那儿听到了它（而我已经四十二岁了）。当我从你们那儿听到了伟大的高尔基写的这篇描写美国大资本家的出色的小说时，你们简直想像不到我何等被感动。多么聪明的问题和多么愚蠢的回答：高尔基问：‘您对于艺术怎样想呢？’大资本家回答：‘我没有想到它，我买到了它。’对于高尔基所问的关于科学的看法，大资本家也有和这同样的观念。而大资本家仅仅说出了一个真理：他赚钱是为了用这些钱再赚钱。就这样一直赚到无限多。这正就是现在我们加拿大和美国大资本家的生财之道。他们用钱制造原子弹，以便用原子弹屠杀爱好和平的人们。在我们加拿大和美国虽然有很多无线电台，但是其中几乎百分之九十五都是广播一些极难听的胡言乱语。在他们的广播中，是没有一点真理的。”
    被收买的美国无线电台履行着它的主子的意志，进行着疯狂的战争宣传。一些最大的美国无线电公司，很久以前就已经和黄色报纸托拉斯赫斯特、麦克米克、克利普斯·霍华德勾结在一起。美国的无线电，也像美国的报纸杂志一样，完全被美国垄断资本所操纵。美国无线电广播中的每一小时，每一分钟，都被工商业托拉斯所收买。许多广告公司，在无线电台和工商业垄断资本家中间起着媒介作用。广告公司掌握着广播剧作家、广播剧导演和演员，与电影明星订立合同，收买广播观察家和广播评论家。美国无线电广播的直接目的，就是为了唤起那些买下广播电台时间的托拉斯和公司的生产品及商品需要的增加。哥伦比亚大学广播讲座的一位编者鲁道尔夫·阿伦格姆写道：“在美国的无线电广播中，为了商品需要的增加，一切手段都是被许可的，而最大的需要是用最野蛮的手段保证着的。”
    标准的美国广播剧和广播脚本等都是极度地无能和低级的。美国的无线电广播不外是一些性欲的和犯罪的故事，庸俗的爵士音乐和扯谎造谣的言论。
    在无线电技术领域中，以发明闻名的美国科学家里·德·弗列斯特，在给国家无线电广播协会的报告中写道：“描述凶杀犯罪的故事每天晚间统治着天空，而孩子们在睡觉以前，由于听了你们的故事而变成了精神病患者。”
    在美国无线电台广播的初期，曾经划分了教育性的广播时间，但是商业性广播很快地就把它们排挤了。弗兰克·希尔一九四二年在纽约出版的一本书中写道：“无线电广播变得越来越低级了……电台限制了言论的自由，把对听众不方便的极少的时间给予教育性的广播，而这个时间完全是由商业方面考虑规定下来的。大商人迅速地排挤了教育性的广播。”
    从那时起，美国的无线电变成了大资本家的不可分的财产。美国无线电“理论家”之一，一个名叫霍夫曼的“教授”确信地说：“听众不希望成为有教养的人，他们希望使他们消遣”……但同时霍夫曼使自己的思想更加明确地说：“更正确点说，并不是什么‘兴趣’，而只是‘由日常生活中吸引听众’。”
    当然，美国无线电广播的目的，决不只限于播送广告。广播电台和广告公司都是为美国垄断资本家的金钱工作的，而美国垄断资本家首先感兴趣的就是愚弄人民，使他们离开美国现实的尖锐问题。颓废的美国无线电广播反映出资产阶级文化的没落。它服务于战争挑拨者的卑鄙目的，这些战争挑拨者顺从的执行着华尔街的意志进行虚伪的宣传。美国无线电千方百计地颂扬着所谓“美国的生活方式”，宣传着关于美国种族优越论的法西斯思想，挑唆着“纯粹的”美国人与黑人以及其他各国民族间的情感，诽谤着一切先进的事业。
    以“马歇尔计划”的帮助，美国垄断资本在欧洲掠取了十几个无线电台，并且使所有马歇尔化国家内的无线电广播隶属于美国的势力范围。例如：澳大利亚的无线电广播就完全被美国人所控制。美国国务院廉价收买了澳大利亚广播电台所有最好的时间，用来进行“美国之声”的谣言广播。
    美国飞机每天将准备好的广播录音胶片从美国送到意大利。美国人将法国的无线电广播也控制在自己的手里。不久以前，法国杂志《无线电论坛》写道：“美国爵士音乐的演唱，在法国无线电广播节目中占据极大的地位，而同时，广播是在美国的‘专家’领导之下进行的。这些广播，播送着所谓‘米斯捷尔·秋伊用一种特制的东西刷牙，就不怕布尔什维克’。
    这样，与纸烟和特制牙膏同时，美国垄断资本家企图以其厌世思想强迫法国和其他各国人民接受，企图挑起他们仇恨一切先进的和进步的事物。按照《无线电论坛》杂志的评断，美国人对法国无线电广播的干涉，已经使法国的无线电变成了为准备战争的工具。
    用美元可以买到欧洲马歇尔化国家内广播电台的时间，也可以全部买到广播电台。在那些国家里，卖国政府为了美元出卖着自己国家的独立和荣誉。那里也可以买到广播评论家和广播剧导演，但是无论任何金钱也不能买到人民。马歇尔化国家的人民知道被美国垄断资本家收买的无线电广播值多少钱，他们坚决地避开了它。
    法国窝克留兹州的一个无线电收听者写道：“您们当然知道法国的无线电在煽动反苏和反共。它为了扩大劳动人民间的分裂，整天广播着虚伪或歪曲的消息。我们的无线电缄默住一切对法国劳动人民有利的国内外消息。因此我们收听莫斯科的广播感到非常高兴，因为莫斯科的无线电，正好广播了那些我们无线电对法国听众隐藏起来的消息。”
    千百封这样的来信，就可以证明欧洲各国欺骗听众的美国化广播的软弱无力。欧洲的劳动人民清楚地知道真理的泉源，并且调整自己的收音机对准莫斯科无线电的波段。
    苏联无线电将各民族友好合作的斯大林思想传播给全世界，并保卫着和平事业。穿过一切障碍，穿过谣言和诽谤，苏联无线电将人民阵线争取和平与民主的必胜信念，深入到千百万普通人的心中。
