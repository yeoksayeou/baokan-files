Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: The Central People's Government Ministry of Health and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission Health Department recently jointly issued instructions on the prevention of cholera. The full text is as follows:

According to past statistics, cholera epidemics have plagued the country, with major outbreaks occurring every three to five years. The Jiangnan area and cities have experienced consecutive epidemics for two to three years. The sources of infection are mostly in major cities and towns in the Yangtze and Pearl River basins. In the past, the reactionary government never carried out effective prevention. Every year, preventive injections, drinking water disinfection, and management of cold drinks were routinely implemented, but these mostly remained formalities or coercive orders, failing to gain the support of the broad masses. Moreover, these epidemic prevention measures often came after the epidemic had already broken out, wasting manpower and resources without any effect. As a result, a small number of patients quickly spread into a disaster. As summer approaches, governments at all levels and health agencies at all levels should immediately prepare for cholera prevention work. In the hotter regions of South China, action should be taken immediately. To this end, it is necessary to:

1.  Pay attention to the early detection of patients and mild cases, as well as carriers: Cholera epidemics often occur because of atypical diarrhea patients (mild cases) or patients not being discovered and isolated, and their feces not being disinfected, contaminating water sources or being spread by flies, leading to widespread disasters. Cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Anqing, Jiujiang, Nanchang, Yichang, Changsha, Yuanling, Changde, Kunming, Guiyang, and Guilin are frequent sites of cholera outbreaks. Before mid-April to May, the existing health laboratories in these areas should be reinforced with manpower and resources, or the testing laboratories of regular hospitals should be strengthened to enable them to conduct large-scale stool examinations, cultures, and isolation and identification of cholera vibrio. Local health authorities should work with local social education organizations, cultural groups, and schools to conduct publicity and mobilize and guide traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to participate in prevention work, so that cholera prevention work becomes a mass movement, raising people's awareness of the harm of cholera and understanding the main methods of prevention. Health teams should be organized in the communities. Any diarrhea patients should be reported immediately. Feces should be sent for examination immediately and disinfected with carbolic acid or bleaching powder, and patients should be isolated to prevent transmission. At the same time, it should be avoided that all patients with vomiting and diarrhea are determined and announced as cholera without scientific examination and diagnosis, causing social unrest.

2.  All health agencies, especially those in large cities, should investigate the people's drinking water situation (tap water, wells, rivers, lakes, Yangtze River, ponds, springs, etc.) before the end of May, and conduct testing. Any water sources contaminated by feces should be disinfected from June to September, and a "drink boiled water, do not drink raw water" campaign should be carried out.

3.  Restrict and manage cold drinks work early. Before the end of May, small vendors selling cold drinks should be thoroughly educated and persuaded to change careers. Cold drink shops that meet sanitary conditions should also be continuously inspected, tested, and supervised.

4.  Launch a cleaning campaign and a fly eradication campaign early. Eliminate fly breeding grounds. In conjunction with cultural and educational institutions, the principle that "killing one fly in the spring is equivalent to killing tens of millions of flies in the summer" should be widely publicized to the masses. Past experience has shown that primary school students and women can be the main force in this movement.

5.  In cities and villages where there is a constant possibility of outbreaks, a preventive injection campaign should be launched by organizing public and private medical personnel before the end of May. Before mid-June, about 50% of the population should be vaccinated, and troops should be vaccinated to 100%. Correct the erroneous method of starting preventive injections only in July and August. We suggest that preventive injections should preferably be a mixed vaccine against cholera, typhoid, and paratyphoid, in order to achieve the purpose of preventing four diseases (namely cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid A, and paratyphoid B) after injection.

As long as the above five tasks are effectively implemented, the spread of cholera can be prevented, and the incidence of typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery can be reduced.

6.  Cholera is an epidemic that is often spread along transportation lines. Therefore, once local health authorities discover and confirm cases of cholera patients or carriers, they should report it to the central government by telegram, telephone, or other fastest means, in order to implement effective quarantine and arrange epidemic prevention work as soon as possible. During this period, local transportation quarantine stations should cooperate with local health authorities to effectively implement quarantine work to prevent the spread of the epidemic through sea, land, and air transportation lines.

7.  Cholera often prevails among people with poor sanitary conditions. Therefore, prevention work must be carried out in the poor urban masses and in the areas with the worst environmental hygiene, such as boat dwellers on the water and the slum areas of large cities in the past, which should be the focus of the work.

8.  The health departments of the three major administrative regions of East China, Central South, and Southwest should list cholera prevention work as one of the most important tasks in the first half of this year. They should organize inspections, summarize the experience of this work at any time, and submit a brief report to us every half month. Military health agencies at all levels stationed in the above areas should not only do a good job in their own military affairs, but also assist local areas in carrying out cholera prevention work.

### 中央卫生部和军委卫生部指示  从速准备预防霍乱

　　中央卫生部和军委卫生部指示
　  从速准备预防霍乱
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府卫生部、人民革命军事委员会卫生部最近联合发出关于预防霍乱的指示。全文如下：
    根据以往统计，霍乱流行为害，几遍全国，每隔三——五年，必大流行一次，江南地区及城市，有二——三年接连流行的，其传染来源，多在长江及珠江流域各大城市及村镇。过去反动政府，从来没有作过有效的预防，每年照例推行预防注射，饮水消毒，及冷饮料的管理，大多流于形式，或强迫命令，不能得到广大群众的拥护，而且这些防疫措施，常落在疫病流行之后，徒然劳民伤财，没有效果。以致少数病患，竟迅速蔓延成灾。兹值夏季将临，各级政府及各级卫生机关应即从速准备霍乱的预防工作。在气候较热的华南各地，并应即时行动起来。为此必须：
    一、注意及早发现病人及轻微患者与带菌人：霍乱流行，常因先有非典型的泻肚病人（轻微患者）或患者未经发觉、隔离，其粪便未经消毒，污染了水源，或由苍蝇传播，以致蔓延成灾。上海、南京、杭州、福州、武汉、广州、重庆、安庆、九江、南昌、宜昌、长沙、沅凌、常德、昆明、贵阳、桂林等城市，是霍乱的常发地，应在四月至五月中旬以前，早日充实各原有的卫生试验所的人力物力，或加强正规医院检验室，使之能大量作粪便检查培养，及霍乱弧菌的分离鉴定工作。各地卫生机关，应结合当地社会教育机关、文化团体及学校等，进行宣传，并动员及指导中医参加预防工作，使预防霍乱的工作，成为一个群众性的运动，提高人民对霍乱危害的认识，并了解预防的主要方法。在居民中组织卫生小组，凡遇泻肚病人，均应即时报告，即时将粪便送检，并最好以石炭酸或漂白粉消毒，并隔离病人，以杜绝传播，但同时亦应避免凡遇上吐下泻病人，不加以科学的检验和诊断，即确定并宣布为霍乱而引起社会不安。
    二、各卫生机关，特别是大城市的卫生机关，应在五月底以前，调查人民饮水的情况（自来水、井、河、湖、江、塘、泉等）加以检验，凡有粪便污染的水源，在六——九月间，应行饮水消毒，并进行“喝开水、不喝生水”的运动。
    三、早日进行限制并管理冷饮料的工作，并在五月底前对出卖冷饮料的小摊贩加以切实教育，劝他们转业，对合乎卫生条件的冷饮料商店，亦应不断加以检查，检验，并监督管理。
    四、早日发动清洁扫除运动及灭蝇运动。铲除苍蝇的孳生地。应结合文化教育机关，把春季灭一个苍蝇等于夏季灭千千万万个苍蝇的道理，向群众广泛宣传。过去经验证明：小学生及妇女可作这个运动的主要力量。
    五、在经常有发病可能的城市及乡村，应在五月底前，组织公私医药人员，发动预防注射的运动，应在六月中旬前，注射人口百分之五十左右，部队要求注射到百分之百。纠正直到七、八月才开始预防注射的错误方法。我们建议预防注射最好注射霍乱、伤寒、副伤寒混合菌苗，以期注射后达到预防四种疾病（即霍乱、伤寒、副伤寒Ａ、副伤寒Ｂ）的目的。
    只要切实的执行了以上五项工作，即可预防霍乱的流行，并可减少伤寒、副伤寒及痢疾的发病。
    六、霍乱是一种常沿交通线传播蔓延的疫病，因此各地卫生机关一旦发现并确证是霍乱患者或带菌人时，均应以电报、电话等最快办法上报直到中央，以期早日执行有效的检疫并布置防疫工作。各地交通检疫所，在此时期，均应配合当地卫生机关，切实执行检疫工作，以免疫病借海、陆、空交通线传播蔓延。
    七、霍乱常在卫生条件较差的群众中流行，所以预防工作，必需深入城市贫苦群众中及环境卫生最差的地方去进行，如水上的船户，过去大都市的贫民区，应为工作的重点。
    八、华东、中南、西南等三大行政区的卫生部，应将预防霍乱的工作，列为本年上半年的最重要的任务之一，应组织检查，随时总结这一工作的经验，向我们每半月作一简报。军队各级卫生机关，凡驻于以上地区的，除作好本军的工作外，并应协助地方进行预防霍乱的工作。
