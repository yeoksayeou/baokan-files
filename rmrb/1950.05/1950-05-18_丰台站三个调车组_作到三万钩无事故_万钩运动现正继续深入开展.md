　　Fengtai Station, May 17th, This Journal -- After Ma Qing, a shunting worker at Fengtai Station of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, created the brilliant achievement of 10,000 accident-free couplings, he motivated all shunting comrades in the station to launch the "10,000 Accident-Free Coupling Movement." From December 20th of last year to the end of April this year, shunting workers, regardless of fatigue, worked day and night following the locomotives, doing their best to prevent accidents. Switchmen gave their full support and cooperated in the work. Workers in the signal towers, car distribution offices, and traffic control offices also participated in this movement, ensuring smooth shunting operations.

　　On March 31st, the Gao Shangquan team, due to carelessness and complacency, lost their achievement of 9,436 couplings, which made other teams become even more vigilant. Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League leaders also went to the front lines to provide specific guidance for this movement. On April 26th, the Wang Hui shunting team was the first to complete the shunting task of 10,000 safe, accident-free couplings. At 4:00 AM and 3:25 PM on April 30th, the Ren Changrui and Guo Zixiang teams also successively completed the task of 10,000 accident-free couplings. When the Guo Zixiang team celebrated the Wang Hui team's success, they were still more than 600 couplings short of their goal. They resolutely guaranteed to complete the task and welcome the "May Day" holiday. With the dedicated cooperation of the car distribution, switching, and signaling departments, the shunting capacity, which had previously been a maximum of only 150-160 couplings, was increased to 225 couplings, creating a new shunting record. On April 30th, it was further increased to a higher achievement of 227 couplings, completing the 10,000 coupling task ahead of schedule. The 10,000 coupling hero Ma Qing guaranteed that there would be no accidents in May, June, and July, and that he would cultivate ten 10,000 coupling heroes.
