Starting Anew, Remaking Oneself
    Remembering the Photo Exhibition of Labor Reform of Special Agents by the Public Security Bureau
    By our reporter Pei Lan
    The photo exhibition on the labor reform of special agents held by the Beijing Public Security Bureau at Zhongshan Park on the 12th of this month has now concluded. The materials in the exhibition fully demonstrate that it is entirely correct to compel special agents to reform themselves through labor, to thoroughly eliminate their opposition thoughts, to bow their heads to the people, and to find a way to start anew.
    The exhibition showcased more than 110 photographs, 17 drawings, and a series of paintings created by the special agents themselves, entitled "Progress Chart of Rice Production in Qinghe Farm, 1950." Under the leadership of farm officials, more than a thousand special agents are engaged in production labor such as digging canals, farming, brick-making, transportation, and machine management in the vast wilderness of 78,000 mu. One photograph shows an endless prairie, which is the site of the Qinghe Farm. In February of this year, the special agents of the Qinghe Brigade came here and began by building shacks. Under the leadership of farm cadres who personally took part in the work, rows of shacks were built in a short time, including dormitories for farm members, dormitories for cadres, offices, kitchens, clinics... After arranging accommodation, they immediately began intense labor.
    The first project was digging canals. This was the primary task in the annual production plan of Qinghe Farm. The farm负责人(fù zé rén - person in charge/principal) considered a basic situation: all special agents used to live by sucking the blood and sweat of the masses, never engaging in labor themselves and despising labor; they had no production skills, and even now, they still had many ideological problems, so there would be many difficulties in their work. Therefore, long-term mobilization and education work was carried out in advance, repeatedly emphasizing that the only way to thoroughly eliminate reactionary thoughts was to participate in labor. Before the start of work, they were called together for meetings to discuss and study the formulation of plans. From the seventeen photographs, it can be seen that they were engaged in labor such as surveying, digging, carrying soil, blocking water, pumping water, and clearing ditches under the leadership of farm cadres. In nearly fifty days, they completed two ten-li long canals, three meters and three deep, three meters wide at the bottom, and twelve meters wide at the top. Teams launched challenge competitions in digging the canals. After the canal was revitalized, forty pumping stations were quickly established, and preparations began for harrowing fields, crushing bean cakes, fertilizing, and sowing. Qinghe Farm does not yet have electrical equipment, but it has fifty diesel engines. Letting them learn to manage and use these machines is an important task at present. Several photographs show them testing machines, learning technology, and studying machine parts. They have already begun to master the diesel engine, using it to drive a bean cake crushing machine that can crush three thousand catties of bean cakes per hour.
    This year, Qinghe Farm plans to cultivate more than 7,000 mu of paddy fields. The farm 负责人(fù zé rén - person in charge/principal) led them in formulating a detailed rice planting plan. Each class held discussions to study specific tasks and methods. The "Progress Chart of Rice Production in Qinghe Farm, 1950" on display at the exhibition, uses vivid pictures to mark the specific labor time required in each season from cultivating, washing alkali, and harrowing the land to threshing and storing in granaries, and the deployment of labor at the farm.
    During the reform process, the lives of the special agents are tense and regular. They publish their own production bulletins in units of squads, encouraging production enthusiasm, criticizing backward ideas, and exchanging labor experiences. After each task is completed, each team selects labor models for the class, team, and the entire farm. The farm 负责人(fù zé rén - person in charge/principal) summarizes in a timely manner, criticizing those who are lazy and encouraging activists. Every day after dinner, there is time for studying and reading the newspaper, and meetings are held in the evening to review the work. In order to combine labor with ideological education, the farm leadership publishes a regular publication called "The Garden of Reform." The farm has established a clinic composed of fourteen people, and has organized two mobile treatment teams to conduct inspections and treatments at the dormitories and workplaces of each team. The sick are taken care of by special personnel. The farm also grows vegetables, raises pigs, and prepares to catch fish to improve everyone's lives.
    Two colorful "Bird's-eye View of Section One of the State-Run Qinghe Farm" present the future prospects of Qinghe Farm. A magnificent office building stands in the center of the farm, with a row of Western-style houses in front, which are the dormitories for farm cadres. Surrounding it are a library, recreation room, clinic, dining hall, guesthouse, swimming pool, and lotus pond. In addition, there are plans to build five new villages, a hospital, a primary school, and a nursery. These buildings have been contracted to a construction factory and construction has begun. The special agents also participated in labor such as measuring land, demarcating foundations, transporting wood, building walls, and digging wells. In order to complete this large-scale building, the farm has built a brick factory. Except for making blanks, the brick burning is done by the special agents themselves. There are currently six brick kilns and eighteen kiln openings, producing one million red bricks per month.
    Seeing the prospects of the farm, the labor enthusiasm of the special agents has gradually improved compared to before. They have discovered their true path from this. Of course, it is not easy to make these people, who were once enemies of the people, understand this principle. In the early days of the liberation of Beijing, the Public Security Bureau of the People's Government concentrated and trained a considerable number of special agents. At that time, many of them still refused to bow their heads to the people, and even continued to cunningly play tricks on the public security personnel of the People's Government, such as feigning confession, procrastinating, and "stalling." Based on the correct policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding meritorious service," the Beijing Public Security Bureau established the Qinghe Brigade in late February of last year, concentrating and training special agents. Over the past year, continuous review and education, propaganda of the Party's lenient policy, exposure of the enemy's crimes, and pointing out the correct path for special agents; welcoming progressive elements, winning over intermediate elements, and isolating and striking backward and stubborn elements, launched a confession movement. During the intensive training, combined with the development of the national victory situation, ideological education was carried out on the special agents, which achieved great results. For example, the great events of millions of troops crossing the Yangtze River and the founding of the People's Republic of China greatly shook the minds of the special agents. They saw the power of the people and had to consider their own way out. But at this time, many of them were still skeptical about labor reform. It was not until they participated in two months of labor that some special agents realized that eating was not easy and that labor was hard work. Their idea of despising the working people began to change, and they felt that they really had no other ability than to oppress the people. At this time, they were relatively honest and willing to reform themselves through labor and atone for their crimes to the people. This is the basic experience in the work of Qinghe Farm, and it is also the only way for special agents to start anew.

　　从头学起，从新作人
    记公安局劳动改造特务图片展览
    本报记者  培蓝
    京市公安局，于本月十二日在中山公园举办的劳动改造特务的图片展览，现已结束。展览会中的材料充分说明：强迫特务在劳动中改造自己，彻底肃清其反对思想，向人民低头，找到重新作人的道路，这是完全正确的。
    展览会中陈列着一百一十多张照片，十七幅绘图，还有特务们自己画的题名为“清河农场五○年水稻生产进度图”的连环画。农场领导一千多名特务分子，在七万八千亩的广阔荒原中，从事挖渠、耕作、烧砖、运输、管理机器等生产劳动。一张照片显现了一片无边的草原，这就是清河农场的场址。今年二月，清河大队的特务们，来到这里之后，首先动手修建窝棚。在农场干部亲自动手领导之下，没有多久，一排排的窝棚修好了，包括场员宿舍、干部宿舍、办公室、厨房、医务所……。安排好住处，紧接着开始了紧张的劳动。
    第一项工程是挖渠。这是清河农场全年生产计划中的首要任务。农场负责人考虑到这样一个基本情况，即：所有特务分子过去都是依靠吸吮群众的血汗为生，自己从不劳动，而且卑视劳动；没有任何生产技能，而且，直到现在，他们思想上还有许多问题，因此在工作中会有很多困难的。所以，事先做了长时期的动员教育工作，一再明确指出：要想彻底肃清反动思想，只有参加劳动，才是出路。动工之前，召集他们开会讨论，研究制订计划。从十七张照片里，可以看到他们在农场干部领导下，从事测量、挖土、抬土、堵水、车水、清理沟渠等劳动。将近五十天工夫，完成了深三米三，底宽三米，顶宽十二米的两道十里长渠。各队在挖渠中，展开了挑战竞赛。大渠复活后，很快建立了四十个扬水站，并开始准备耙田、碎豆饼、施肥、播种等工作。清河农场还没有电力设备，但有五十部柴油机。让他们学会管理、使用这些机器，是目前工作的一个重要课题。几张照片显示了他们试验机器，学习技术，研究机件的情景。他们已经开始掌握了柴油机，用柴油机带动碎饼机，每小时能碎三千斤豆饼。
    今年，清河农场计划垦殖七千多亩稻田。农场负责人领导他们拟订了详细的种稻计划。每班都开了讨论会，研究具体任务和作法。展览会上“清河农场五○年水稻生产进度图”，用生动的画面，标帜着耕地、洗碱、耙地到脱粒、入仓等各个季节中，需要的具体劳动时间，和该场劳力的部署。
    在改造过程中，特务们的生活是紧张而有规律的。他们以中队为单位，出版自己的生产快报，鼓励生产情绪，批评落后思想，交流劳动经验。每一任务完成后，各队都要评选出班、队及全场的劳动模范。农场负责人则及时总结，批评消极怠工分子，鼓励积极分子。每天饭后都有一段学习读报的时间，晚上开会检讨工作。为了结合劳动进行思想教育，场方领导他们出版了《改造园地》的定期刊物。农场设立了一个由十四个人组成的医务所，并组织了两个巡回治疗小组，随时到各队宿舍及工作地点进行检查治疗。病号有专人照顾。农场还种菜，养猪，准备捕鱼，以改善大家的生活。
    两幅彩色的“国营清河农场一部鸟瞰图”，展现出清河农场的远景。一座巍峨壮丽的办公大楼屹立在农场中央，前边是一排洋房，这是农场干部的宿舍。周围是图书馆、游艺室、医务所、饭厅、招待所、游泳池和莲花池。此外，还计划建筑五个新村，一座医院，一所小学校和一个托儿所。这些建筑已由营造厂承包，开始动工了。特务们也参加了量地、划地基、运木料、砌墙、打井等劳动。为了完成这个规模宏大的建筑，农场已修成一座烧砖厂。烧砖除打坯外，都是特务们自己劳动。现有六座砖窑，十八个窑孔，每月出产红砖一百万块。
    特务们看到农场的远景，劳动情绪较前逐步提高了。他们从中发现自己的真正出路。当然，让这些曾经是人民的敌人的人懂得这个道理，是很不容易的。在北京解放初期，人民政府公安局集中管训了相当数目的特务分子。那时，他们当中许多人还拒绝向人民低头，甚至继续狡猾地和人民政府的公安人员玩弄花样，如假坦白，拖延，“泡蘑菇”等。京市公安局依据“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的正确政策，于去年二月下旬，成立了清河大队，集中管训特务分子。一年来，不断进行审查教育，宣传党的宽大政策，暴露敌人的罪恶，指出特务的正确出路；欢迎有进步的分子，争取中间分子，孤立与打击落后的顽固分子，展开坦白运动。集训中，结合全国胜利形势的发展，对特务进行思想教育，收到很大效果。如百万大军下江南，中华人民共和国成立的伟大事件，对特务们的思想震动极大，他们看见了人民的力量，不得不考虑自己的出路。但这时他们中间许多人对于劳动改造还是怀疑的。直到他们参加了两个月的劳动，部分特务才认识了吃饭不容易，劳动是艰苦的事。他们那种卑视劳动人民的思想才开始改变，感到自己除了压迫人民之外，实在没有别的本事。这时候，他们比较老实了，愿意在劳动中改造自己，向人民赎罪了。这是清河农场工作中的基本经验，也是特务们重新做人的唯一途径。
