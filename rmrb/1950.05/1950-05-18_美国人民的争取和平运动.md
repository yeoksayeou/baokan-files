　　The American People's Movement for Peace
　　Chen Youwei
    Today, the movement to defend world peace has entered a new stage: not only has more than half of the world's population organized and joined the ranks of those striving for peace, but the broad masses of working people have taken heroic, resolute, and practical actions in the struggle for peace; not only are the forces of peace being developed and consolidated in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, but a surge of enthusiasm for peace is also being unleashed like wildfire in the capitalist imperialist countries. The broad masses of the American people are also shouting the slogan "We want peace! We oppose war!"

    The New York Peace Conference, convened by the National Council of American Scientists, Artists, and Professionals on March 25-27 last year, was an organized expression of the American people's movement for peace. Despite the reactionary American government's various obstructions and the dispatch of secret agents to disrupt the conference in advance, the meeting was nevertheless carried out for three consecutive days in a warm atmosphere. It passed a resolution calling for a struggle against fascism and to stop new wars, established the "Cultural and Scientific Community for Peace Committee," and launched a petition for peace signature campaign. Even more indicative of the American people's desire and strength for peace was the mass rally of 20,000 people held in Madison Square on the closing day of the Peace Conference. Representatives from Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Britain, and the Soviet Union spoke at the meeting. When the speakers denounced the US imperialist reactionaries' conspiracy to divide and weaken the forces of peace, the attendees repeatedly responded with thunderous applause and cheers.

    The convening of the "All-American Trade Union Peace Conference" representing American workers is of particular importance. As Will Grant, chairman of the Greater Detroit Automobile Workers Union, pointed out in his speech: "The All-American Trade Union Peace Conference is of great historical importance to the American people. It will produce a strong, organized workers' peace movement, whose scale and strength will continue to increase..." The conference was held in Chicago in early October last year, with 1,200 participants representing the Steelworkers Union, the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, and other industrial unions. Many representatives of independent trade union local organizations strongly criticized the American government's reactionary policies and war conspiracies during their speeches at the meeting, calling for the abolition of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, and demanding peaceful cooperation with the Soviet Union. The conference decided to establish a "Standing Committee of American Trade Unions to Defend Peace" and adopted a program including six demands. The main content of this program was to demand negotiations with the Soviet Union; to ban atomic weapons; and to reduce armaments to relieve the American people of the burden of military spending.

    The development of the American people's movement for peace is not limited to progressive figures in the workers, cultural, and artistic circles. In December last year, more than 1,000 leaders from the American religious and scientific communities, as well as social celebrities, also held a gathering in New York and issued a statement demanding a ban on atomic weapons. Prior to this, a mass rally was held in Madison Square, New York, initiated by the National Committee of the American-Soviet Friendship Association. 12,000 people attended the meeting, advocating that the atomic bomb be declared illegal and promising to intensify and expand the struggle against war-mongers in the United States. In March of this year, a mass rally in support of peace was held in New York under the auspices of the American Women's Committee. The attendees unanimously demanded that Truman stop manufacturing atomic weapons and hold negotiations with the Soviet Union. The famous American writer Howard Fast also gave a speech at the meeting, emphasizing: "The main task of the American people is to stop Truman, Acheson, and the monopoly capitalists behind them from realizing their aggressive goals."

    The US imperialists' measures of frantically expanding armaments and arming Western Europe to implement their expansionist and aggressive policies have aroused the indignation of the broad masses of the American people. The Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of the US Congress had received more than 6,500 letters from all over the United States by the end of March this year, and has continued to receive nearly 200 such letters every day since. The American people who wrote these letters demanded that the American government stop the disastrous arms race and demanded peace. This shows that the American people are eagerly hoping for peace and demanding peace. At the same time, American black and white veterans who contributed to the anti-fascist war established the "New York Veterans Federation." They decided to organize picket lines and hold demonstrations to oppose the US government's shipment of arms to Western Europe in preparation for aggressive war against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. After Truman announced that the United States would begin manufacturing hydrogen bombs, the broad masses of the American people protested and opposed it. First, eleven national organizations issued an open letter to Truman demanding a correct solution to the problems caused by the manufacture of hydrogen bombs. These eleven organizations included: the League of Women Voters, the Textile Workers Union of America, the National Farmers Union, the National Women's Trade Union League, the Cooperative League of the USA, the International Association of Machinists, the Federation of American Scientists, etc. Similarly, opposition was also aroused in religious circles. The American progressive newspaper "People's World" conducted a poll among church leaders in Seattle, the industrial center of the American West Coast. The results of the poll showed that almost everyone demanded a ban on this weapon of mass destruction. The opinion of Reverend Shortle of the "People's Church" can be regarded as a typical comment, as he denounced the US government's policy towards the Soviet Union as a "devil's policy."

    The Communist Party of the United States—the only party in the United States that conforms to the interests of the American people—is the pioneer and leading force of the American people's movement for peace. At the enlarged meeting of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States in January this year, an action program on the steps for the American people to fight for peace was adopted. At the meeting of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States in March, in the report by CPUSA Chairman Foster, it was also pointed out that the most important task of the CPUSA at present is the struggle for peace and the shattering of the plans of the Wall Street monopoly capitalist warmongers.

    The Progressive Party of the United States has also made great efforts in the movement for peace. On February 25th this year, the Progressive Party held its Second National Convention in Chicago and passed a peace program including six proposals. The first of these proposals was to demand that atomic weapons be declared illegal and to condemn the country that uses atomic weapons as an international criminal.

    The American people's movement for peace is a link in the world peace movement, and it is being carried out and developed in various forms. Of course, we cannot deny that the American people's peace movement faces many difficulties today, but its ranks have gradually expanded to include workers, peasants, women, youth, and even all strata of society. United with the vast number of peace-loving people in the world, the American people are not isolated. Their movement and strength for peace will continue to develop and grow stronger along with the continued development and strengthening of the world peace movement, until the power of all mankind forces the warmongers to accept peace.

　　美国人民的争取和平运动
　　陈有为
    今天，保卫世界和平的运动已进入了新的阶段：不但全世界一半以上的人口已经组织起来参加了争取和平的行列，而且广大的劳动人民已经在争取和平的斗争中，作了英勇的坚决的实际行动；不但在苏联与人民民主国家内发展着并巩固着保卫和平的力量，而且在资本帝义主义各国内也如火如荼地掀起了争取和平的热潮。广大的美国人民，也正在喊出了“要求和平！反对战争！”的呼声。
    去年三月二十五——二十七日由美国科学家、艺术家与自由职业全国委员会所召开的纽约和平大会，是美国人民争取和平运动有组织的表现。尽管美国反动政府在事先多方阻挠并驱使特务企图扰乱大会，但结果这次会议还是在热烈的气氛中连续进行了三天。通过了号召进行反对法西斯主义与阻止新战争的斗争的决议，成立了“文化与科学界拥护和平委员会”，并且发起了和平请愿书签名运动。更足以显示出美国人民要求和平的愿望与力量的，是和平大会于闭幕的那一天在麦迪逊广场召开了有二万人参加的群众大会。在会上发言的有古巴、捷克、英国与苏联的代表。当演讲者痛斥美帝国主义反动派分化和削弱和平力量的阴谋时，与会群众一再地报以雷动般的掌声与欢呼声。
    代表美国工人的“全美职工会和平大会”的召开，更有着特别重要的意义，正如大底特律汽车业工人工会主席威尔·格兰特在他的演说中所指出一样：“全美职工会和平大会，对于美国人民，具有巨大的历史重要性。它将产生强大的、有组织的工人和平运动，这个运动的规模和实力将不断增加……。”这次大会于去年十月初在芝加哥举行，参加者有一千二百人，代表着钢铁工人工会、开矿和冶金工人工会、无线电电气和机器工人联合工会，和其他各种工业的工会。许多独立工会地方组织的代表在会上演讲时，都强烈地抨击了美国政府的反动政策与战争阴谋，号召废止侵略性的北大西洋公约，并要求与苏联和平地合作。大会决定设立“美国职工会保卫和平常设委员会”，并通过了一个包括六项要求的纲领，这个纲领的主要内容就是要求与苏联谈判；禁用原子武器；裁减军备以解除美国人民的军费负担。
    美国人民拥护和平运动的开展，还不仅仅限于工人与文化、艺术界的进步人士。去年十二月间，美国宗教界、科学界的领袖与社会名流一千余人，也在纽约举行集会，发表了要求禁用原子武器的声明。在此以前，由美苏友好协会全国委员会发起，在纽约麦迪逊广场举行了一次群众大会。与会者达一万二千人，会上主张宣布原子弹为非法，并保证加紧和扩大反对美国国内战争贩子的斗争。今年三月间，在美国妇女委员会主持之下，纽约举行了一次拥护和平的群众大会，与会群众一致要求杜鲁门停止制造原子武器，并与苏联举行谈判。会上美国的著名作家法斯特也发表了演说，他着重地指出：“美国人民的主要任务，是在于阻止杜鲁门、艾奇逊和他们背后的垄断资本家们实现他们的侵略目的。”
    美帝国主义为了要实现其扩张主义的侵略政策而进行的疯狂扩充军备的措施，与武装西欧的行动，引起了广大美国民众的愤慨。美国国会原子能联合委员会在今年三月下旬已收到了六千五百多封来自美国各地的信件，并且以后每天还继续收到近二百封这样的信件。写这些信件的美国人民，要求美国政府停止灾难性的军备竞赛，要求和平。这说明了美国人民是热望着和平并要求和平的。与此同时，在反法西斯战争中曾出过力的美国黑人与白人退伍军人，成立了“纽约退伍军人联合会”。决定组织纠察线并举行示威，反对美国政府把军火输送到西欧去准备反对苏联与人民民主国家的侵略性战争。在杜鲁门宣布美国开始制造氢弹之后，广大的美国人民纷纷抗议与反对。首先有十一个全国性的团体发表致杜鲁门的公开信，要求正确地解决由于制造氢弹而引起的问题。这十一个团体中包括：妇女选民同盟，产联纺织工人工会、全国农民同盟、全国妇女工会同盟、美国合作社同盟、劳联机械师国际协会、美国科学家联合会等。同样，在宗教界中也引起了反对，美国的进步报纸《人民世界》报在美国西岸的工业中心西雅图的教会领袖间，举行了一次民意测验，测验的结果，显示出几乎每一个人都要求禁止这种大规模毁灭性的武器。“人民教会”牧师萧特尔的意见可算为典型的评论，他把美国政府的对苏政策斥为“魔鬼的政策”。
    美国共产党——美国的唯一符合美国人民利益的政党——是美国人民争取和平运动的先驱与领导力量。今年一月间，美共全国委员会的扩大会议上，曾通过了关于美国人民为保卫和平而奋斗的步骤的行动纲领。三月间美共全国委员会的会议上，美共主席福斯特的报告中也指出：美共目前最重要的任务，就是争取和平的斗争，与粉碎华尔街垄断资本家战贩的计划。
    美国进步党在争取和平的运动中，也尽了很大的努力，今年二月二十五日，进步党在芝加哥举行了第二届全国代表大会，通过了包括六项建议的和平纲领，建议的第一项就是要求宣布原子武器为非法，并斥责使用原子武器的国家为国际罪犯。
    美国人民争取和平的运动是世界和平运动的一环，它正以各种不同的形式进行着，开展着。当然我们不可否认，美国人民的和平运动今天所面临着的困难是不少的，但是，它的队伍已逐渐地扩展到工人、农民、妇女、青年以至于社会的各阶层里去，与广大的世界爱好和平的人民团结在一起，美国人民是并不孤立的，他们争取和平的运动与力量，将会随着世界和平运动的继续发展壮大而发展壮大，直到用全人类的力量逼使战争贩子接受和平为止。
