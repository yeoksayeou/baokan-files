　　Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi's Opening Speech at the National Flood Prevention Conference (Abstract)
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi's opening speech at the National Flood Prevention Conference is excerpted as follows:

    Today, we are convening this National Flood Prevention Conference with representatives from major administrative regions, centrally-administered provinces, and water conservancy organs of various river basins. This is a very important conference. Last year's floods caused varying degrees of water damage in vast areas across the country, resulting in significant losses to people's lives and agricultural production. Therefore, overcoming floods and water disasters this year is a necessary guarantee for the restoration and development of agricultural production. To achieve this guarantee, flood control and drainage are regarded as prominent priorities in the allocation of national water conservancy funds, accounting for 73 percent of the total water conservancy expenditure, and also constituting a significant portion of the total national economic construction costs. The earthwork volume amounts to over 300 million cubic meters. To achieve this guarantee, not only is the Ministry of Water Resources making every effort, but Party and government leading organs across the country have also universally emphasized and vigorously supported this work, viewing it as a political task that must be completed. To achieve this guarantee, since last winter, millions of people, including administrative cadres and water conservancy cadres from across the country, from both disaster-stricken and non-disaster-stricken areas, have been working diligently and arduously for several months, braving ice, snow, wind, and rain. Local People's Liberation Army units have also participated in this work. Up to now, except for some inland river embankments, the main dikes have been basically completed. We have obtained a considerable and powerful material foundation in the fight against floods. However, to utilize this weapon, human power needs to be appropriately organized to maximize its effectiveness. Sometimes, a well-organized workforce can even compensate for the original shortcomings of the dike projects. In terms of timing, the period before the major flood season is rapidly approaching. We are on the eve of battle. Therefore, this flood prevention conference is also a preparatory meeting for the Chinese people to fight and overcome floods this year. Today, I will only offer some preliminary suggestions for your reference.

            Flood Control and Drainage Projects: Unprecedentedly Great Achievements

    First of all, regarding this year's flood control and drainage projects, we believe that the achievements are extremely significant. According to reports prior to the conference, the East China region has completed over 100 million cubic meters out of a total of over 180 million cubic meters by the end of April. The Central South region has completed over 50 million cubic meters out of a total of over 71 million cubic meters by the end of April. The Yellow River has completed over 7.6 million cubic meters out of a total of over 13 million cubic meters by the end of April. The North China region has completed over 10 million cubic meters out of a total of over 27 million cubic meters by the end of April. Other regions, such as Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, have also completed significant amounts. According to reports from various regions, all projects can be completed before the flood season. The scale of this project is unprecedented in Chinese history. At a time when the national financial and economic situation still faces considerable difficulties, the government has allocated such significant funds for dike construction and water management, fully demonstrating how much the people's own government cares about the needs of the people. At the same time, such a large project needs to be completed within a short period of several months, and the mobilization of civilian workers must take into account spring plowing and sideline production, coupled with continuous spring rains, which add many difficulties to the workers' work, food, and accommodation. However, through the efforts of cadres and the masses in various regions, the main dikes have been basically completed. Most areas have indeed mastered the engineering standards, and some areas have even achieved the requirements of layered soil compaction and solid construction. Although there were rough or wasteful phenomena in the dike construction process, these are shortcomings that come along with success. Because the demands of the people are urgent, the project is large, and the time is short, we can only overcome difficulties and correct shortcomings in our work. As for the heroic and exemplary deeds of many cadres and civilian workers who fought arduously, and the spirit of initiative, positivity, mutual assistance, and friendship shown by the troops participating in the construction, they should be highly commended. Due to these efforts, we have a relatively solid dike line across the country for defense. Based on this foundation, we should have full confidence in overcoming this year's floods.

    However, there are still some problems that require our serious attention. First, because the country has not been liberated for long and the past foundation was too poor, although we have undertaken such a large project this year, it is still focused and selective, and it is not possible to solve the problems that have never been solved in history all at once. The second is the issue of project quality. According to inspection reports, although all dike construction projects this year have made great progress compared to the past, there are also some areas or individual dike sections that are still far from the prescribed engineering standards. It is hoped that in this conference, water conservancy organs in various regions will provide a relatively detailed report on the situation they have learned, with particular emphasis on the degree of dike consolidation, flood resistance capacity, and current shortcomings and remedial measures. (14)

            Assume Higher Responsibilities, Achieve Maximum Guarantees

    Secondly, this conference will determine the guiding principles and tasks for this year's flood prevention work. This year, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, in its summary of the Yellow River management work conference, raised the issue of "unlimited responsibility," believing that in engineering design, we must, based on the historical situation of each river and the possibility of manpower and material resources, propose appropriate engineering standards for a reasonable water situation. However, our responsibility for river defense should be unlimited. Within the safe standard of floods, breaches are absolutely not allowed. Even if the flood exceeds the safe standard, or even the height of the dike, we must still try every possible means to exert organizational strength to compensate for the deficiencies of the project. Therefore, on the one hand, we must oppose certain unscientific attitudes in the construction of prevention projects, that is, failing to make accurate estimates of water conditions and flow rates, and blindly demanding universal repairs and enlargement of dike projects, so that national funds cannot be used economically, distinguishing between priorities and urgencies. On the other hand, we must also oppose the bureaucratic attitude of old-style water conservancy organs towards flood prevention work, which is to be responsible for breaches within a certain limit and not responsible for breaches beyond that limit. We believe that this view put forward by the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission is very good in principle and spirit. For this year's flood prevention, the safety standards of each river must be further studied in the conference to clarify the minimum responsibility of the competent authorities. The experiences and lessons of major breaches of major rivers last year should also be put forward here as a warning for this year's flood prevention. According to reports and inspection results, the exceptionally large floods were a general reason for the major breaches of each river last year, but from the perspective of certain sections, the causes of the breaches were also due to insufficient inspections, insufficient vigilance, negligent defense, and untimely preparation of materials and mobilization of manpower. These lessons are well-known truths, but often, due to the failure to implement extremely ordinary truths, serious losses are caused to the people. We must deeply remember these painful experiences.

    In short, our flood prevention conditions this year are different from previous years. Therefore, we must assume higher responsibilities and achieve the maximum guarantee in order to fully demonstrate our spirit of serving the people. But on the other hand, we must be realistic and determine the safety standards of each river separately as the basis for reviewing this year's flood prevention work.

            Organize a Flood Prevention Headquarters, Closely Link Upstream and Downstream

    Third, is the issue of the organization and leadership of flood prevention work. This includes several issues. The first is the issue of the flood prevention leadership agency. Because flood prevention work is very important to the lives and agricultural production of people along the river, and this work, whether it is patrolling dikes, reporting floods, or emergency rescue, must rely on the active support of the broad masses, we believe that flood prevention work must be led by the heads of local administrations in order to be mobile and powerful, and to organize the masses. Past experience has shown that local garrisons of the People's Liberation Army have also automatically participated in this work and have made great achievements. Therefore, for the organization and leadership of flood prevention work this year, we propose that a national flood prevention headquarters be organized at the central level, led by responsible comrades designated by the State Council, with representatives from the Military Commission also participating in the leadership, and the Ministry of Water Resources handling daily affairs. The State Council has agreed to this approach. We hope that all regions will also follow this spirit and establish strong joint leadership institutions. The second issue is the relationship between river basin water conservancy agencies and local water conservancy agencies. On the one hand, there must be close contact in terms of mastering water conditions and the relationship between upstream and downstream, and between main and tributary streams. On the other hand, the leadership of flood prevention work must also cooperate with the system of administrative leadership in order to be mobile and flexible. The third issue is the conflicts of interest between upstream and downstream, main and tributary streams, left and right banks, which have historically existed or may occur, as well as some individual issues of interlaced defense and benefit relations between provinces and regions. We must clearly put forward and implement the principle of small interests serving large interests, and large interests appropriately taking care of small interests.

    Fourth, is the issue of flood reporting methods and the budget for flood prevention materials and expenses. It is hoped that the actual experience of various regions will be consulted and discussed, and attention should be paid to gradually reducing unexpected and large expenditures.

        Move from Passive Defense to Active Benefit

    Finally, I would like to talk about the future and vision of our water conservancy work. Because our river defense projects are built every year to repair dikes and prevent floods, some may inevitably doubt whether our water conservancy work will always be this kind of defensive and passive work? We believe that the actual situation is not like this. The reason why our water management work this year is still stuck in the defensive and passive stage is because our past foundation was too poor. Just like the national economic situation, the dilapidated situation left by the reactionary rulers for decades needs us to clean up and reorganize. At the same time, our own scientific investigation and research on the national river channel topography and hydrological data are not yet sufficient, so we have to do passive defense work for the time being. However, with the improvement of the national economic situation, in line with the needs of large-scale development of agricultural production in the next three or four years, in line with the future development of industry and transportation and the electrification of the country, and with the progress of our department's work, our water management work will gradually shift to an active, scientific, fundamental, and beneficial direction. Our current work is precisely to create conditions for promoting and accelerating this transition. We are now afraid of water, and in the future we will love water. Now we are repairing river dikes, and in the future we will build dams. Now we are sending water to the sea as much as possible, and in the future we will treat water as a valuable resource, storing it up, controlling it, and not wasting a single drop. This bright and splendid vision of ours is not too far away, and may be partially realized in the near future. Although we are still in the stage of passive defense, our current large-scale, intensive, and combat work is precisely to urge the early realization of this bright future.

　　水利部傅作义部长在全国防汛会议上的开幕词（摘要）
    【新华社讯】水利部傅作义部长在全国防汛会议上的开幕词摘要如下：
    今天我们召集各大行政区，中央直属各省和各流域水利机关，举行全国防汛会议，这是一个很重要的会议。由于去年的洪水在全国广大地区造成或轻或重的水灾，使人民生活与农业生产受到很大的损失，所以今年战胜洪水、克服水患，是恢复与发展农业生产当中的一个必要的保证。为了求得这一保证，全国水利事业费的分配，防洪排水被视为一个突出的重点，其经费比例，占全部水利事业费百分之七十三，在全部国家经济建设费用中也占很大的数字。土方工程数达三亿公方以上。为了求得这一保证，不仅水利部门全力以赴，全国各地党政领导机关，都已普遍重视，大力支持，视为必需完成的政治任务。为了求得这一保证，从去年冬季开始，全国各地行政干部与水利干部，灾区与非灾区的数百万群众，冒冰雪，沐风雨，胼手胝足，已经做了几个月紧张艰苦的努力，各地人民解放军也参加了这一工作。到现在，除一部分内河圩堤以外，主要堤防已经基本完成，我们在对洪水的斗争上，已经获得相当强大的物质基础。不过运用这一个武器，还需要人的力量有适当的组织，才能发挥它应有的效能，有时人的力量若组织得好，还可以补救堤防工程原有的缺点。就时间计算，现在距大汛到来的期限，已经十分迫近，我们正处于战斗的前夜。所以这一次防汛会议，也就是今年中国人民与洪水斗争，要战胜洪水的准备会议。今天我只提出一些初步意见，供各位同志参考。
            防洪排水工程  成绩空前巨大
    首先，就今年防洪排水的工程来说，我们认为成绩是非常巨大的。根据会议以前的报告，华东区一亿八千余万公方，截至四月底，已经完成一亿公方有余。中南区七千一百余万公方，四月底已完成五千余万公方，黄河一千三百余万公方，四月底已完成七百六十余万公方。华北区二千七百余万公方，四月底已完成一千余万公方。其他如东北区和内蒙也已完成很大的数字，根据各地报告，汛期以前都可完成。这个工程规模的宏大，在中国历史上是空前的，在国家财政经济还存在相当困难的时候，政府拿出这样大的经费用于修堤治水，充分说明人民自己的政府如何关切人民的需要。同时，这样大的工程，需要在几个月短促的时间内完成，民工动员又须照顾到春耕与副业生产，再加上春雨连绵，给民工的做工食宿增加很多困难。可是，经过各地干部与群众的努力，主要堤防已经基本完成，多数地区确实掌握了工程标准，部分地区并且做到了层土层硪、修筑坚实的要求。虽然在修堤过程中间有粗糙或浪费的现象，也都是成功当中随带而来的缺点。因为人民的要求迫切、工程大、时间短，我们只能在工作中克服困难，改正缺点。至于许多干部民工艰苦奋斗的英雄模范事迹，部队参加修工，指战人员所表现自动积极与友爱互助的精神，则应该受到高度的表扬。由于这种努力，我们对全国河防，已经具备了相当坚固的堤线可资防守。在这一基础上，我们对于战胜今年的洪水，应该具有充分的信心。
    可是另一方面，也还存在着一些问题，需要我们切实注意。第一是因为全国解放未久，过去的基础过差，我们今年虽然举办了这样大的工程，却还是有重点有选择的，还不可能一下解决历史上从来没有解决的问题。第二是工程质量问题，根据检查报告，今年全部修堤工程虽然都比过去有很大的进步，可是也有部分地区或个别堤段，仍然和规定的工程标准相距甚远。希望在这一次会议中，由各地水利机关，就已经了解的情况，做一次比较详细的报告，特别着重于堤防巩固的程度，抵御洪水的能力，以及目前存在的缺点和补救方法。（⑴⑷）
            负起更高责任  实现最大保证
    其次，这次会议我们要决定今年防汛工作的方针任务。今年黄河水利委员会在治黄工作会议的总结里，曾经提出“无限责任”的问题，认为我们在工程设计上，必须根据各河流的历史情况和人力物力的可能，针对一个合理水情，提出适当的工程标准，可是我们对于河防的责任，则应该是无限的。洪水在安全标准以内，自然绝对不准溃决，即使洪水超过安全标准，甚至超过堤防高度，我们仍要想尽一切方法，发挥组织力量，以补救工程的不足。因此，我们一方面要反对修防工程中某种不科学的态度，就是对于水情流量不去作精确的估计，一味要求普遍补修，加大堤防工程，使国家经费不能分别轻重缓急，做最经济的使用。另一方面，也要反对旧式水利机关对防汛工作的官僚态度，便是在什么界限以内决口负责，在什么界限以外决口不负责的态度。黄委会所提的这一种意见，我们认为在原则与精神上是很好的。对于今年防汛，各河流的安全标准，会议中仍须再加研究，以明确主管机关最低限度的责任。关于去年各大河流重要决口的经验教训，也应该在这里提出，做为今年防汛的警惕。根据报告和检查的结果，去年各河的重大决口，洪水特大自然是一般的原因，但是就一定的地段来看，溃决的原因由于检查不周，警惕不够，防守疏忽，物料准备与人工动员不及时者，亦不在少数。这些教训都是尽人皆知的道理，可是，往往由于极平凡的道理，不能贯彻执行，造成人民的严重损失。这些惨痛经验，我们必须深刻记取。
    总之，我们今年防汛的条件，和历年不同了。因此我们必须要负起更高的责任，实现最大的保证，才能充分发挥我们为人民服务的精神。可是另一面，我们又必须实事求是，分别确定各河流的安全标准，以做为今年防汛工作检讨的根据。
            组织防汛总指挥部  上游下游密切联系
    第三，是关于防汛工作的组织领导问题。其中又包括几个问题。第一个是防汛的领导机构问题。因为防汛工作对于沿河的人民生活和农业生产关系非常重大，同时这一工作无论是巡堤、报汛、抢险，都须依靠广大群众的积极支持，所以我们的意见，认为防汛工作必须由各地行政首长负责领导，才能机动有力，有组织的发挥群众力量。过去的经验，人民解放军各地驻军也都自动的参加了这一工作，有过很大的成绩。所以今年防汛工作的组织领导，我们提议在中央组织全国防汛总指挥部，由政务院指定负责同志领导，军委也派代表参加领导，由水利部办理日常业务。政务院对这一办法已经同意。我们希望各地也都依照这一精神，建立有力的共同领导的机构。第二个问题是流域水利机关与地方水利机关的关系问题，一方面在水情的掌握上，在上下游、本支流的关系上，必须有密切的联系，另一方面在防汛工作的领导上，又须配合行政领导的系统，以求机动灵活。第三个问题是上下游，本支流，左右岸，利害冲突，历来存在着纠纷，或者可能发生纠纷的问题，以及省际区际防守受益关系交错的一些个别问题。我们必须明确提出贯彻执行小利服从大利、大利适当照顾小利的原则。
    第四、是关于报汛的办法和防汛物料与经费预算问题。希望参酌各地的实际经验，加以讨论，要注意逐渐减少意外的庞大开支。
        要从被动防御  走向主动兴利
    最后，我愿意谈谈我们水利工作的前途和远景的问题。因为我们的河防工程，每年都是修堤防汛，有的也许不免怀疑我们的水利工作是不是永远做这种防御的被动的工作？我们认为实际情形不是这样的。我们今年的治水工作，所以仍然停留在防御被动的阶段，是因为我们过去的基础太差了。正如全国的经济情形一样，反动统治者几十年所留下的残破不堪的局面，需要我们收拾整理。同时，我们自己对于全国河道地形与水文资料，科学的调查研究工作也还做得不够，所以暂时不得不作被动防御的工作。可是随着全国经济情况的好转，配合今后三四年内大规模发展农业生产的需要，配合将来工业与交通的发展和全国电气化的需要，随着我们本部门工作的进步，我们治水的工作，一定会逐渐转变到主动的、科学的、治本的、兴利的方向。我们目前的工作，也正是为推动加速这一个转变而创设条件。我们现在害怕水，将来我们会喜爱水，现在我们是修顺河堤，将来我们会修拦河坝，现在我们是把水尽量的送到海里去，将来我们会把水当作宝贵的资源，贮蓄起来，控制起来，一点一滴都不肯浪费。我们这一个光明灿烂的远景并不太远，最近期内就可能部分实现，我们现在虽仍停留在被动防御的阶段，可是我们现在大规模的突击的战斗的工作，正是催促这个光明前途的早日实现。
