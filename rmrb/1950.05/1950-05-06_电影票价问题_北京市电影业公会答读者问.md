　　Movie Ticket Price Issues
    Beijing Film Industry Association Answers Readers' Questions

To the Editor:

    After you forwarded the opinions from various parties requesting a reduction in movie ticket prices in line with the decline in commodity prices, we held a meeting to discuss this matter. We believe that maintaining the original price is still necessary at this time. The reasons are as follows:

    1. Although millet prices have fallen, the major recurring expenses of theaters, such as water, electricity, telephone, newspaper advertising, film equipment, and carbon rods, have not decreased.

    2. For domestically produced, Soviet, and progressive films produced by private studios, there are specific regulations for preferential treatment of groups, namely, purchasing tickets at a 40% or 30% discount. Currently, tens of thousands of 40% discount coupons for the aforementioned films have been printed and distributed to various units, thus reducing the price burden on the basic audience.

    3. Movie ticket prices in our city are already lower than those in Tianjin and Shanghai. In the future, if costs are reduced and business conditions improve, ticket prices will be reduced according to the actual situation.

### 电影票价问题  北京市电影业公会答读者问

　　电影票价问题
    北京市电影业公会答读者问编辑同志：
    你们转来各方要求电影票价随物价下跌而减低的意见后，我们曾开会加以讨论，认为现在还是需要维持原价。原因如下：
    一、小米价虽落，而院方经常之大项开支如水、电、电话、报纸广告、影机器材及炭精等皆未落价。
    二、国营片、苏联片及私营厂出产的进步影片，原有优待团体的具体规定，即按六折或七折购票；目前上述各片已印制数万张六折优待券发送各单位，这样已减低了基本观众的票价负担。
    三、本市电影票价比天津上海两市尚较低，今后如成本减低营业情况转好，当依照实际情况减低票价。
