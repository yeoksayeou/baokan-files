The State Council of the Central People's Government's approval of the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation's instructions regarding national forestry work is a matter worthy of attention. Treating forests as a nationwide construction undertaking is not only something the Kuomintang reactionary government never did, but also an unprecedented move in China's history of thousands of years. Throughout history, the ruling class has only destroyed forests, not built them. Up to now, only 750 million mu of relatively reliable forests remain in China's more than 14 billion mu of territory, which means that forest land accounts for only 5.18 percent of the land. According to Soviet research, forest area must account for 30 percent of the total land area and be appropriately distributed to regulate the climate, conserve water and soil, and prevent disasters. This can be proven by reports of wind, sand, water, and drought disasters in China over the years.

Water is inherently beneficial to farmland, hence the term "water conservancy." However, China's rivers frequently become water disasters. Why? Because the land is full of barren mountains with no grass or trees. As a result, the soil on the mountains has no shelter or protection, and the mountains are full of sand and soil, allowing rainwater to erode them at will. The sand content of the Yellow River and the Liao River sometimes reaches as high as 5 percent. As a result, river channels are constantly silting up, and dikes frequently breach. Last year's floods inundated 120 million mu of farmland across the country, killed more than 6,000 people, and created disaster areas for 40 million people, with Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu being the most severely affected. The disasters in Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shandong came from the Yellow River, the disasters in central and southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu came from the Yi River, and the disasters in eastern Hebei came from the Luan River. This illustrates the close relationship between water disasters and barren mountains.

The harm of sand is even greater than that of water. Water retreats and advances, but sand only advances and does not retreat. In Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Chahar, Inner Mongolia, and northern Shaanxi, there are sandy deserts stretching for thousands of miles. Wind and sand are encroaching southeastward, covering the Great Temple (Xinmin County), burying the power poles in Dengkou, Ningxia, and swallowing countless houses. This dreadful torrent of sand, winding for thousands of miles, ravages the land every year. In the Jingbian to Fugux area of northern Shaanxi alone, an average of 20,000 mu of good farmland is buried by sand every year, and the situation elsewhere can be imagined. Only by cultivating forests can the disaster of sand be resolved.

Only the people's own government has the sincerity to seek happiness for the people, the courage to fight against nature, and the strength to overcome various disasters. Only the people's own government has the foresight to allocate funds from difficult finances to carry out forestry construction for the people's future happy life.

The instructions point out that protecting forests is the primary task at present. China has only 5.18 percent of forest land, and these weak resources are currently suffering from theft, indiscriminate felling, grazing, firewood gathering, and forest fires in many areas. The causes of this disaster are roughly as follows: 1. Some people living near the mountains rely on the mountains for their livelihood, using logging as a sideline; 2. Some farmers, in order to reclaim land, easily cut down trees or even burn mountains; 3. Some local governments sometimes rely on forests to solve some financial problems; 4. Some merchants specialize in logging and selling timber; 5. Some enterprises (such as some coal mining companies) compete to purchase timber from timber-producing areas, causing indiscriminate felling, as has happened in eastern Hebei; 6. Individual military units have used forests as production targets, and the indiscriminate felling incident at Ci'er Mountain in Zhangjiakou is an example; 7. Before the land reform, landlords destroyed forests; 8. Special agents or local bullies intentionally destroy forests; 9. Some residents arbitrarily and indiscriminately cut down trees, such as the East Shanqiao Forest Farm incident in Nanjing last July, where thousands of residents openly cut down more than 200,000 trees, destroying more than 1,400 mu of forest land; the Qinling forest area in Shaanxi also suffered serious damage before April of this year; 10. Other careless causes lead to serious forest fires, such as the fire in Inner Mongolia last year that burned down more than 5 million cubic meters of timber, and another forest fire that started on April 8 this year and burned for fifteen days.

Another fact shows that if the action of destroying forests is strictly prohibited, it will not only protect the existing forests, but also raise the enthusiasm of the masses to plant trees and their love of forests. For example, last year Wanping County punished 36 cases of burning mountains and stealing trees, strictly implemented the policy of forest protection, and the people actively started planting trees, saying: "This time it is guaranteed." Many counties in the Northeast have organized mass forest protection teams, with each team having someone responsible, implementing "rewards for forest protectors and punishments for forest destroyers." For example, Wang Weibo, the county chief of Dongning County, Songjiang Province, was commended by the provincial government for his meritorious service in forest protection; Han Ping, the county chief of Muling County, was punished for his poor performance in forest protection. Clear rewards and punishments, and determined responsibilities, have thus widely aroused the people's love of forests. Therefore, to plant trees, we must first protect forests, and we must fundamentally stop those who destroy forests. This is the most important task at present.

Forest protection is not only about protecting existing forests, but also about protecting even the land that has already been logged, under appropriate conditions, and nurturing them into forests. This is what the instructions say: "Closing hillsides for afforestation." There are many mountains in China where the soil is not completely barren and the trees are not extinct. As long as the mountains are closed in a step-by-step manner and logging is prohibited, good forests can be cultivated. There are many such examples: In the Lvliang Mountains of Jiaocheng County, Shanxi Province, spruce and larch originally grew all over the mountains at an altitude of 2,000 to 2,500 meters. A major fire in 1928 killed more than 95 percent of the trees. Fortunately, the mountains were high and no one went up the mountains to collect firewood or graze. After 20 years, natural seeding from above has resulted in the growth of closed larch and birch forests. Another example is Yicheng in the Zhongtiao Mountains, where the Jin Yu Match Company cut down all the birch, linden, and poplar trees on the mountain before 1936. Fortunately, the mountains were high and the trees have now grown back into forests. As for the areas south of the Yangtze River, where humidity is high, temperature is high, and plants grow rapidly, "closing hillsides for afforestation" is even easier to achieve. "Closing hillsides for afforestation" is a mass creation of cadres and masses in the old liberated areas. Experience has shown that this is the most economical and convenient method. This occupies an important part of the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation's work plan for 1950 and is a matter that deserves special attention.

The instructions point out that afforestation should have key points; what are the key points? The Kuomintang reactionary government left us with 430 million mu of barren mountains. Can we quickly and universally afforest them in the shortest possible time? No. First, forestry is a long-term plan that cannot be achieved overnight. The Soviet Union established national field shelterbelts covering 5,320 kilometers in length and 117,900 hectares in width, and 4 million hectares of field shelterbelts for collective farms and state farms, with a planned period of 15 years; our country has just been liberated, and we cannot seek quick results. Second, the military situation has not ended, Taiwan and Tibet have not been liberated, and the living expenses of millions of military and government personnel are still a major burden on the government. Therefore, the state cannot have more funds for forestry for the time being. Third, there is the problem of forestry cadres. Very few specialized colleges and universities had more than ten forestry graduates in 1950, and all regions feel the lack of technical personnel. These conditions make it necessary for our afforestation work to select key points and make it impossible to implement it universally.

Where are the key points? According to the instructions: Areas where fire, drought, and sand disasters originate are a key point, which is based on need. Second, areas where the masses have a foundation. Everyone knows that it is unimaginable to hire workers to afforest so many barren mountains in China, so it is necessary to mobilize and organize the masses to carry it out. However, it is futile to have people without seedlings and seeds; third, areas where seedling conditions are available. Weighing the importance, distinguishing the urgency, considering the sequence, and using limited funds in the most appropriate and essential places is the task of forestry workers at present.

The instructions point out that reasonable logging should be implemented. For example, in the Northeast, logging standards and production quotas have been set, logging roots have been lowered, tree tops have been utilized, forest farms have been cleared, and afforestation has been carried out rationally.

Finally, it should be emphasized that our love for forests throughout the country should be brought to the attention and importance of the people's thinking and habits. A broad mass forest protection movement should be launched on a conscious basis. We must know that without forests, there will be no good water conservancy; without good water conservancy, there will be no reliable harvest. This means that the entire country loses its reliance on forests, which not only directly affects the development of industry, transportation, and construction, but also directly affects agricultural harvests and is related to the happiness of all the people. Therefore, today's forestry work is a huge and arduous task that is related to the vital interests of everyone. Therefore, under the call of the government, we must make it known to every household and take action, seize the opportunity, and use various methods to carry out publicity. Encourage and educate the masses, combine them with the interests of the masses, organize them, and engage in forest protection, afforestation, and reasonable logging. Otherwise, not only will the work not be done well, but it will not be possible to effectively stop all actions that destroy forests.

Forestry is a new undertaking of the new China. Today, it only represents the beginning of the new China's forestry. We have the confidence to fulfill the tasks entrusted to us in the instructions, and we call on all the people to work hard to fully realize this task!

### 重视森林、保护森林

　　重视森林、保护森林
    中央人民政府政务院批准了林垦部提出的关于全国林业工作的指示，是一件值得重视的事。把森林当作全国范围内的建设事业，这不仅是国民党反动政府所没有做过的，即在中国几千年来的历史上，也是空前的举动。从来统治阶级，对森林只有毁坏，没有建设。到现在，中国一百四十多亿市亩领土中，只留存着比较确实可靠的森林七亿五千多万市亩，就是说，林地仅占领土百分之五·一八。据苏联研究，森林面积须占土地总面积百分之三十，而且要适当地分布，才能够调节气候，保持水土，免除灾害。这从中国历年来的风、砂、水、旱灾情的报道中，可以得到证明。
    水本来是有利于农田的，所以称为水利。然而中国的河流，却经常成为水灾。为什么？因为遍地是荒山没有青草，没有树林。以致山上的土壤，毫无掩蔽，毫无保障，满山砂土任凭雨水冲刷。黄河和辽河的含砂量，有时高达百分之五。因此，河道不断淤阻，堤防经常溃决。去年的洪水，淹没了全国农地一亿二千万亩，淹死了六千多人，造成了四千万人口的灾区，而以河北、平原、山东、皖北和苏北为最重。河北、平原及山东之灾，来自黄河，鲁中南和苏北之灾，来自沂河，冀东之灾来自滦河。这就说明了水灾和荒山的密切关系。
    砂之为害，更甚于水。水有退有进，砂则只进不退。新疆、甘肃、宁夏、绥远、察哈尔、内蒙及陕北一带，绵亘数千里都有砂碛。风砂向东南侵袭，掩盖了大庙（新民县），埋没了宁夏磴口的电杆，吞没了无数民房。这一条蜿蜒数千里的可恶的砂的洪流，年年乘风肆虐，单是在陕北靖边到府谷一带，平均每年被砂埋没的良田以二万亩计，其他更可想见。砂的灾害，只有培植森林才能解除。
    只有人民自己的政府，才有诚意为人民谋幸福，才有勇气和大自然作斗争，才有力量克服各种灾难；也只有人民自己的政府，才有远见在困难的财政中还拨出款项来为人民将来的美满生活而进行林业的建设。
    指示中指出：护林是当前主要的任务。中国只有百分之五·一八的林地，这些薄弱的资源，在许多地区，目前正受着盗伐、滥砍、放牧、采樵、山火种种的损害。造成这种灾害的原因，大致有以下几种：一、有些群众靠山吃山，以砍伐森林为副产；二、有些农民为了开垦，轻于采伐，甚至烧山；三、有些地方政府有时靠森林解决部分财政问题；四、有些商人专以砍伐与贩卖木材为生；五、有些企业机构（例如某些煤矿公司）向木材产地争购，引起滥伐，冀东就有过这种例子；六、个别部队曾以森林为生产对象，张家口赐儿山滥伐事件，就是一个实例；七、土地改革前，地主破坏森林；八、特务或土劣有意破坏森林；九、有些居民任意乱伐树木，如去年七月南京东善桥林场事件，成千居民公开伐乱树木二十多万株，破坏了林地面积一千四百余亩；陕西秦岭林区在今年四月以前也曾遭受严重的破坏；十、其他不慎原因引起严重的山火，如内蒙古在去年烧毁了五百多万立方公尺木材，今年四月八日又起林火，一直烧了十五天。
    而另一种事实又说明着：如果对于破坏森林的行动严格地禁止，不但对现存的林木有了保障，更足以提起群众造林的情绪和爱林的思想。如：去年宛平县处罚了三十六件烧山和盗树案件，严格执行了护林政策，老百姓就积极地造起林来，他们说：“这回可有保障了”。东北有许多县，组织群众护林队，每队有人负责，实行“护林者奖，毁林者罚”。例如松江省东宁县长王蔚伯护林有功，被省府明令褒扬；穆陵县长韩屏，护林不力，则受处罚。赏罚分明，确定责任，因而广泛地激起了群众的爱林思想。所以要造林，必先护林，必须把毁坏林木的，在基本上停止下来。这是目前头等重要的任务。
    护林不仅是保护成林的林木，即使是已经砍伐了的林地，在适当条件下也须设法保护，抚养成林。这就是指示中所说：“封山育林”。中国有许多山地，土不全赤，树不绝种，只要有步骤地把山封起来，禁止砍伐，就能养成很好的森林。这种例子甚多：山西交城县吕梁山系，在二千至二千五百公尺高山上，本来满山生长云杉和落叶松，一九二八年大火，烧死了百分之九五以上的树木，幸而山高，没有人上山打柴和放牧，经过二十年，从上方天然下种，现在又成长了落叶松和桦木的郁闭林。又如中条山系翼城地方，一九三六年以前，晋裕火柴公司，把山上所有桦木、椴木、杨木砍光，幸而山高，现在树木又生长成林。至于扬子江以南地区，湿度大，温度高，植物生长迅速，“封山育林”更易奏效。“封山育林”，是老区工作干部群众性的创造。经验证明：这是最经济、最简便的办法。这在林垦部一九五○年的工作计划中，占着重要的一环，是值得特别提出和特别注意的一项。
    指示中指出：造林要有重点；什么是重点？国民党反动政府留给我们的有四十三万万市亩的荒山，我们能不能迅速地普遍地在最短期内造起林来呢？不能。第一，林业是百年大计，不可能一蹴而成。苏联建立面积达五千三百二十公里长十一万七千九百公顷广的国家护田林带，和四百万公顷的集体农场和国营农场的护田森林，其计划期限为十五年；我们国土刚刚解放，更不能求速效。第二，军事尚未结束，台湾和西藏尚未解放，数百万军政人员的生活费，尚成为政府的一个大负担。因此，暂时国家尚不可能有更多的经费用在林业方面。第三，是林业干部问题。专门以上学校一九五○年度林科毕业生超过十人的甚少，各地区都感到技术人员缺乏。这些条件就使我们的造林工作，必须选择重点，而不可能普遍施行。
    那里是重点呢？据指示：火灾、旱灾、砂灾发源的地区是一种重点，这是从需要出发的。其次，是群众有基础的地区。谁都知道，像中国这样多的荒山，统统要雇工造林，是不可想像的，所以必须发动群众组织群众来进行。然而有人而无苗木，无种子，又是徒然；第三，是种苗条件具备的地区。权衡轻重，分别缓急，斟酌先后，把有限的经费，用在最适当最切要的地方，这就是目前林业工作者的任务。
    指示中指出：要贯彻合理的采伐。如在东北就规定了伐采标准和生产定额，降低伐根，利用树梢，清理林场，合理造林。
    最后，应该着重指出的，我们对全国森林的爱护，要在人民的思想上、习惯上引起注意，加以重视。要在自觉的基础上，展开广泛群众性的护林运动。我们要知道，如果没有森林，就没有良好的水利；没有良好的水利，就没有可靠的丰收。这就是说全国失掉了森林的依靠，不仅直接影响工业和交通建筑事业的发展，更直接影响农业的收获，关系着全体人民的幸福。因此今天的林业工作，是一个庞大而繁重的工作，关系着每一个人的切身利益。所以我们必须在政府的号召下，使广大人民家喻户晓，行动起来，抓紧机会，利用各种方式，进行宣传。鼓励与教育群众，给合群众利益，组织他们，从事护林、造林和合理采伐的工作。否则，不仅工作做不好，更不能有效地制止一切破坏森林的行动。
    林业是新中国的新事业，在今天只不过表示了新中国林业的开端，我们有信心实现指示中所赋予的任务，并号召全体人民为完满实现这一任务而努力！
