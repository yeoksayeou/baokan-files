Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Following the exposure of the Hua Gang mine disaster, according to an investigation by the Kiso River branch of the Nagano Prefecture branch of the "Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union," during the war, the Japanese government, military, and other relevant parties forced 1,500 Chinese prisoners of war to participate in labor to construct the Mt. Ontake hydroelectric power plant in Nagano Prefecture, in the central part of Honshu, of whom 1,000 were brutally murdered. According to the Japanese Communist Party's organ, *Red Flag*, which reprinted the union's investigation into the atrocity on April 3rd, the details are as follows:

From 1942 onwards, Japan Electric Generation and Transmission Company commissioned "Hazamagumi," "Tobishimagumi," "Kajimagumi," "Kumagaigumi" and other civil engineering and construction companies to build the Mt. Ontake hydroelectric power plant on the Ohtaki River line of the Kiso River system. According to the files left at the factory construction offices located in Ohtaki Village, Mitake Village, and Kaida Village in Nishichikuma County, Nagano Prefecture, a total of 1,500 Chinese prisoners of war were collectively transferred to the former two villages between April and August 1944. From 1944 to 1945, they were all forced to participate in civil engineering construction. According to nearby villagers, even in severe cold weather of minus ten degrees Celsius, these prisoners of war were only draped in sacks and paper bags used for cement, and their feet were wrapped in straw. Their daily food consisted of inferior bread mixed with 60% wheat flour and 40% bran, and each person received only three small loaves of this bread, each seven centimeters long and three centimeters wide and thick. Because they could not bear the hunger, the prisoners of war often gathered wild grass to satisfy their hunger. This kind of abuse resulted in a large number of deaths. According to the death reports left by the village government, the causes of death included being blown up, hanging, suicide, complex fractures of the back of the head, and general weakness, including gastrointestinal diseases. Even in these official records, it is possible to imagine that many of the dead were murdered. The villagers' conversations more fully illustrate this point. Villagers said that five Chinese were killed in the water tunnel. They personally saw thirty seriously ill people in the prisoner-of-war dormitory in Mitake Village, who had lost their sight due to malnutrition, being driven into the mountains and never seen again. Under constant brutal massacres, by the time the war ended and they were sent back to China, only 500 of the original 1,500 prisoners of war survived, and as many as 1,000 were brutally murdered.

After the war, the Japan Electric Generation and Transmission Company destroyed relevant documents. However, according to the remaining records, it can be clearly seen that the direct person in charge of forcing Chinese prisoners of war to engage in construction projects was Eijiro Ishikawa. This one of the chief culprits of the massacre has not only not received the punishment he deserves, but is now openly serving as the president of the Tokai branch of the Japan Electric Generation and Transmission Company.

Regarding the major atrocity of the Japanese reactionaries massacring Chinese prisoners of war in the Kiso River in Nagano Prefecture, various Japanese democratic groups have called for investigating the war criminals who were responsible at the time. During a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives on April 3, both members Katsumi Totonami (Communist Party) and Yoshio Namiki (Democratic Party) formally demanded that the Yoshida government investigate the responsibility for the atrocity. Totonami also condemned the Yoshida government for covering up the truth about the atrocity and protecting war criminals. This is a complete violation of the Potsdam Declaration. Takashi, the director of the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the Yoshida government, responded to Katsumi Totonami's inquiry by evasively saying, "We are prepared to investigate and deal with it appropriately."

　　赤旗报刊载日电气产业工会调查证明
    日战犯战时虐杀我战俘千人
    日共议员要求吉田政府追究惨案责任
    【新华社六日讯】继花冈矿山大惨案暴露后，近据“日本电气产业工会”长野县支部木曾川分会的调查，战时日本政府、军部及其他有关当事人，为修筑本州中部长野县御岳水力发电厂，曾强迫一千五百名中国战俘参加劳动，其中有一千名惨遭虐杀。据四月三日日本共产党机关报赤旗报转载该工会所调查的惨案经过情形如下：
    自一九四二年起，日本发送电株式会社委托“间组”、“飞岛组”、“鹿岛组”、“熊谷组”等土木建筑公司，建筑木曾川水系王泷川线的御岳水力发电厂。根据分布在长野县西筑摩郡的王泷村、三岳村及开田村的工厂建设事务所遗留的卷宗，自一九四四年四月到八月，前两村先后共集体移入中国战俘一千五百名。在一九四四年到一九四五年，他们都被迫参加土木建筑。这些战俘的情况，据附近村民说，即使在零下十余度的严寒天气，他们仅披着麻袋和装洋灰用的纸袋，脚上裹着稻草。他们日常吃的东西，是掺杂百分之六十小麦粉与百分之四十糠的粗劣的面包，而且每天每人只分到长七公分、宽厚各三公分的这种小面包三个。因为不堪饥饿，战俘们经常采食野草充饥。这样虐待的结果，引起了大批死亡。依据村政府所遗留的死亡报告，死亡的原因有炸死、缢死、自杀、后脑部复杂骨折、以及包括肠胃病在内的全身衰弱症。就在这些官方记录中，也能想像到死者很多是被虐杀的。村民的谈话更充分说明了这点。村民说在水路隧道中有五名中国人被杀。他们曾亲眼看到在三岳村俘虏宿舍中的三十名因营养失调而丧失视力的重病人，被赶到山里，再没有看到他们出来。在不断的残酷虐杀下，到战争结束被送回中国时，原先一千五百名战俘中，只幸存五百名，惨遭虐杀的竟达一千名之多。
    战争结束后，日本发送电株式会社方面曾把有关文书加以烧毁。但根据残留的记录，还可以清楚地看出：强迫中国战俘从事建筑工程的直接负责人，是石川荣次郎。这个虐杀案元凶之一不仅未受应得的惩罚，现在并公然担任日本发送电株式会社东海支社社长。
    对于日本反动派在长野县木曾川虐杀中国战俘大惨案，日本各民主团体纷纷提出追究当时负责诸战犯的要求。四月三日众议院外务委员会举行会议时，听涛克己（共产党）及并木芳雄（民主党）两委员均正式向吉田政府追究该惨案的责任问题。听涛并斥责吉田政府掩盖惨案真相，包庇战犯。这完全是违背波茨坦宣言。吉田政府刑务局长高桥对听涛克己的质询，竟以“准备调查，并适当处理”来搪塞。
