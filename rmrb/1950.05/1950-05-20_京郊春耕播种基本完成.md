[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Spring planting by the emancipated farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, on their own land for the first time, has now been basically completed. In conjunction with the spring planting, under the leadership and assistance of the Municipal People's Government, they have also successfully completed tasks such as river dredging, canal repair, drought prevention, flood control, universal epidemic prevention injections for large livestock, and mass pest control campaigns, providing a strong guarantee for agricultural production in the suburbs and increasing their production enthusiasm and confidence in increasing production by 10% this year.

The suburbs of Beijing have more than 1.04 million mu of cultivated land. In order to shorten the spring famine period, the Beijing Municipal People's Government led and assisted suburban farmers in planting more than 330,000 mu of wheat last winter. In early March this year, it issued early-maturing crop seed loans worth 250,000 jin of millet to assist suburban farmers in planting spring wheat, kidney beans, and lima beans and other early-maturing crops. After the suburban farmers were allocated land, especially after the Suburban Committee of the Municipal Government held an enlarged cadre meeting in late March to deploy this year's agricultural production, they carried out spring plowing preparations such as accumulating fertilizer and harrowing the land. Suburban farmers hauled a total of 61,600 tons of ditch mud from projects such as excavating sewers in the urban area, equivalent to more than 20,500 tons of dry manure. This has made the fertilizer application in the suburban farmland this year generally more than double that of last year. For example, in Bali Zhuang, the 13th district, a total of 5,730 carts of fertilizer were applied, with an average of three carts of fertilizer per mu. In addition to the early-maturing crop loans, the Beijing Municipal People's Government also issued agricultural loans worth 4.5 million jin of millet to assist suburban farmers in solving the difficulties of lacking fertilizer, seeds, farm tools, livestock, wells, and sideline production tools. In this way, the suburban farmers' production enthusiasm became even higher, and they began spring planting in early April. Most of the farmland in the villages has been plowed twice. Now, except for a very few low-lying wetlands, major autumn crops such as corn, sorghum, millet, peanuts, and cotton have been planted; and 10,000 jin of excellent crop seeds such as Huanong No. 1 millet, cultivated by the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, have been sown.

In addition, in order to prevent floods, this spring, the suburbs of Beijing, in combination with disaster relief and without delaying agricultural work, used work-for-relief methods to carry out projects such as dredging river channels and excavating drainage ditches with a total length of 123,250 meters, excavating a total of 374,043 cubic meters of mud. This not only saved 120,000 mu of good farmland from flooding and ensured the agricultural production of more than 40,000 farmers along the river, but also allowed more than 15,000 disaster-stricken farmers who participated in the river excavation to receive more than 500,000 jin of work-relief grain, allowing them to safely survive the spring famine. In terms of water conservancy, six new canals were excavated and old canals were repaired. In addition to ensuring the irrigation of the original paddy fields, and turning more than 8,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields, it is estimated that the production of millet can be increased by 450,000 jin.

The spring epidemic prevention injections for large livestock carried out in March inoculated a total of 24,049 horses, mules, donkeys, cattle, and camels, accounting for 82% of the total number of large livestock in the suburbs, adding another layer of guarantee to agricultural production. In late April, wheat leaf bee larvae were successively discovered in 76 villages in the suburbs, endangering more than 6,200 mu of wheat fields. The Municipal People's Government led suburban farmers to completely eliminate them within half a month, mobilizing a total of more than 13,500 people and killing 3,681 jin of wheat leaf bee larvae, with about 8,000 heads per jin. This prevented the wheat leaf bee larvae from spreading into a disaster, powerfully guaranteeing the fruits of victory of the emancipated farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, and also breaking the fatalistic superstitious ideas of some farmers. A farmer in the 19th district said: "The Communist Party and the People's Government have solutions! We rush to plant in drought, dig ditches in floods, and can kill insects!"

Thanks to the leadership of the government and the efforts of the farmers, the wheat fields in the suburbs of Beijing are now extremely lush. The dry land wheat has already reached full head and is in the stage of grain filling, while the paddy field wheat is in the stage of flowering and heading. According to experienced farmers, this year there is sufficient rain and the weather is cool, so the wheat harvest looks promising.

　　京郊春耕播种基本完成
    【京市新闻处讯】京郊翻身农民第一次在自己的土地上进行的春耕播种工作现已基本完成。结合着春耕播种，他们并在市人民政府的领导与协助下胜利地完成了挖河、修渠、防旱、防涝、大家畜普遍防疫注射和群众性的捕虫运动等工作，为郊区农业生产提供了有力的保证，提高了生产情绪和对今年增产一成的信心。
    京郊共有耕地一百零四万余亩。为了缩短春荒时间，京市人民政府曾于去年冬季领导和协助郊区农民种麦三十三万余亩，今年三月初旬又贷发价值小米二十五万斤的早熟作物种子贷款，协助郊区农民播种春麦、芸豆、扁豆等早熟作物。郊区农民分得土地后，尤其在三月下旬市府郊委会召开郊区扩大干部会议，布置今年农业生产后，即进行积肥、耙地等春耕准备工作。郊区农民从城区掏挖下水道等工程中共拉得沟泥六万一千六百吨，相当于粪干二万零五百余吨。使今年郊区农田施肥普遍超过去年的一倍，如十三区八里庄共施肥五千七百三十车，平均每亩施肥已达三车。除了早熟作物贷款外，京市人民政府又曾贷发价值小米四百五十万斤的农业贷款，协助郊区农民解决了缺乏肥料、种子、农具、牲畜、水井和副业生产工具的困难，这样，郊区农民生产情绪越发高涨，从四月初旬开始春耕播种，各村农田大部都已犁过两遍；现在，除极少数低洼湿地外，都已种上玉米、高粱、谷子、花生、棉花等大秋作物；并曾播种华北农业科学研究所培植的华农一号谷子等优良作物种子一万斤。
    此外，为了防治水患，今年春季京市郊区在结合救灾，不误农时的原则下，用以工代赈的方式进行了长达十二万三千二百五十公尺的疏浚河道开挖排水沟等工程，共挖出泥土三十七万四千零四十三立方公尺。不仅使十二万亩良田免于涝灾，沿河一带四万余农民的农业生产获得保障，同时，参加挖河的一万五千余灾区农民共获工赈米五十万余斤，得以安然渡过春荒。在兴修水利方面曾开挖新渠、修整旧渠六条，除了保证原有水田的灌溉，并使旱田八千余亩变为水田外，约可增产小米四十五万斤。
    三月间进行的大家畜春季防疫注射，共注射了马、骡、驴、牛、骆驼等二万四千零四十九头，占全郊区大家畜的百分之八十二，对农业生产又增加一层保证。四月下旬，郊区七十六个村相继发现麦叶蜂幼虫，为害麦田六千二百余亩，市人民政府领导郊区农民于半个月内全部予以捕灭，总计共动员一万三千五百余人，捕杀麦叶蜂幼虫三千六百八十一斤，每斤约有八千头，使麦叶蜂幼虫未能蔓延成灾，有力地保障了京郊翻身农民的胜利果实，并且，破除了部分农民的听天由命的迷信思想。十九区的一个农民说：“共产党、人民政府就是有办法，旱了抢种，涝了挖沟，有虫子还能打！”
    由于政府的领导及农民的努力，现在，京郊麦田已极茂盛，旱地麦子已经绣齐了穗，正在灌浆，水地麦子正在扬花吐穗。据有经验的农民说：今年雨水足，天气又凉爽，麦子收成看好。
