Workers Love Chairman Mao
    A Glimpse of Worker Education at the Training Class of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    By Our Reporter Pei Lan

    The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has adopted the form of "training classes" to train on a large scale Party members and activists among the employees of public factories and mines. This is one of the good methods to improve the trainees' class consciousness and establish a communist world outlook. The training class began in March last year and has held five sessions, training a total of 4,133 students, including 3,321 workers, accounting for 80 percent of the total number of students. In the first four sessions, a total of 1,041 outstanding students were admitted to the Chinese Communist Party, cultivating a number of backbones for major public factories. The trainees who returned to the factory generally performed well. Many of them are now working in trade unions or the Communist Youth League. More trainees have played a backbone and leading role in production after returning to the factory. For example, Xi Dasheng, a trainee of the training class and a Party group leader, led other workers to become the backbone of the rush repair of No. 6 generator of Shijingshan Power Plant. Qi Shuangrong, a foundry worker at the Liulihe Cement Factory, learned the mass line during the training class. After returning to the factory after training, he was elected as a foreman. Whenever he received a task assigned by the superior, he discussed it with everyone, concentrating everyone's wisdom and giving play to everyone's enthusiasm. In the past, it took a week to start a smelting furnace, but now it only takes four and a half days. Workers at the 70th Arsenal used to produce a maximum of four copper sleeves for water pumps a day. After Wang Changchun studied and returned to the factory, he made nine a day. He also motivated worker Wang Bingzhang to make nine a day as well. Li Maotang, a worker at the Machine Branch Factory No. 3, returned to the factory after completing his studies. On his first night shift, he increased the record of producing 50 to 60 screws per night to more than 100, and after improving the tools, he further increased it to 315.

    Why did things that were impossible in the past happen today? This can be seen from what the trainees of the training class talked about their completely different political status and living conditions before and after liberation. Among the trainees in the fifth training class, there was a 19-year-old female worker named Wang Shuzhen. Before liberation, her family was poor and unable to make a living. Her parents had sold her to landlords as a maid twice. At the age of twelve, she went to work in a clothing factory, suffering all kinds of bullying and oppression. However, after the liberation of Beijing, due to her active work, she was hired as a specially invited representative to the first Workers' Congress of Beijing and was elected as an executive member of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. Such a glorious political status was unimaginable in the past. The trainee Guo Yu is a worker at the Mentougou Coal Mine. He now has a small family of three and can earn a salary of 330 catties of rice per month, living a life of eating two-thirds of refined grains and one-third of coarse grains. Before liberation, he also worked in the mine. His monthly salary was two bags of flour. However, after deduction and exploitation by the contractor and grain and coal deductions, he only received 1.16 bags of flour per month. In this way, his family of four could not maintain their lives no matter what, so he worked continuous shifts regardless of his life, working 16 hours a day. His mother and sister also had to wash clothes for others. But in less than two months, Guo Yu became ill from exhaustion, his father starved to death, and his mother and sister also fled back to their old home where they had no house or land. The family was thus broken up.

    Every trainee in the training class has a history similar to that of Wang Shuzhen and Guo Yu. However, how poor were they in the past? How much of their hard-earned money was sucked away by others? Many people were not very clear about this until today. The training class explained to the students that labor creates society, historical materialism, and the state and revolution, thereby improving the students' class consciousness. In the study of class struggle, the theory of surplus value was emphasized, and the workers were allowed to calculate accounts, so that they could understand how much of the fruits of their labor they had obtained and how much they had been exploited by others. In addition, in order to avoid misunderstandings among workers about the New Democratic economy, the socialist nature of state-owned enterprises and the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit were also explained.

    According to the accounts of the Mentougou Coal Mine, from January to July 1948, each worker was exploited nine bags of flour per month. The old worker Yan Jidong worked for 28 years and was exploited more than 3,000 bags of flour, enough for his family of six to live for 29 years. The old worker Lu Mao of the 70th Arsenal worked for 31 years, and only four and a half years of labor was for himself. This figure shocked all the trainees and they began to clearly understand the secrets of exploitation in capitalist society.

    The experience of the training class over the past year has proven that the speaking bitterness movement is a major link in further enhancing the class consciousness of the working class. The fifth training class of the training class began the speaking bitterness movement throughout the school on April 27. With infinite grief and anger, Wang Deyou poured out the bitterness that had accumulated in his heart for more than 20 years. He said: "I am from Shunyi County. My family was poor since I was a child. My father worked as a porter for others, eating and drinking little. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I was forced by life to run to Beijing and worked for others in Tianqiao to make a living. Once, a policeman saw me wearing a worn military uniform and insisted that I was a Eighth Route Army soldier. He arrested me and nailed four nails to a stool and asked me to lie on it with the nails facing my heart. My head and legs were tied with ropes, and the middle was pressed with a pressing plate. I fainted several times, and the devils poured cold water on me. Brothers! Even so, I didn't say a word!" He then said: "Once, I was captured to work in Xizhimen. One night, a warehouse next to Xizhimen caught fire. I went to help put out the fire and met Japanese soldiers when I came back. They said that I set the fire. They grabbed me and let foreign dogs bite the meat off my legs. Brothers, I have died several deaths. I really didn't expect to meet you today, and I didn't expect to find my own mother. Chairman Mao saved me, we must not forget it!" He opened his clothes and rolled up his trouser legs. Everyone in the audience stared at his scars with tear-red eyes. There were still four nail marks on his heart, and there were many blue and red blood scars on his legs where the foreign dogs had bitten off the meat. Wang Deyou looked at the extremely grief-stricken classmates and said: "Brothers! There is no need to cry. With the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our working class has become the masters of the country. Now, I have gloriously joined the Communist Party and truly found my relatives! We must thoroughly transform the old society!"

    The bloody facts of the past clearly surfaced in the minds of every worker. Tracing back to the source, people increased their love for today's revolutionary achievements even more. The workers said: "If Chairman Mao had not planted the red flag on Jinggang Mountain and led us to make revolution, how could we workers have today?" After speaking bitterness, the workers' eyes became brighter and they loved the Communist Party and Chairman Mao even more. Many workers asked to join the Party. At the speaking bitterness meeting, some workers wrote a note to the responsible comrades of the training class in a cordial tone, requesting to see Chairman Mao. The note read: "Communist Party Chairman Mao, he led us through bloody struggles on the snowy mountains and grasslands. He knew that his children had suffered, so today he asked us to tell these sufferings, so that he can listen and pull us to demand blood debts. We have lived in his arms to this day, we want to see our dear mother, we want our mother to see her children, even if it's just for a minute, it will be happy and glorious, we can finally say we haven't lived in vain, and we will be satisfied to see our mother with our own eyes!"

　　工人热爱毛主席
    记中共北京市委干训班工人教育的一斑
    本报记者  培蓝
    中共北京市委采取“干训班”的形式，大规模训练公营工厂、矿山职工中的党员和积极分子。这是提高受训学员的阶级觉悟，确立共产主义人生观的良好方法之一。干训班从去年三月开始，已经办了五期，共训练了学员四千一百三十三名，其中有工人三千三百二十一名，占全体学员的百分之八十。在前四期中，共吸收了一千零四十一名优秀学员参加了中国共产党，给各主要公营工厂培养了一部分骨干。受训回厂的学员，一般都表现的很好。现在有很多人已担任了工会或青年团的工作。更多的学员回厂以后，在生产上起了骨干带头作用。例如：训练班的学员、党的小组长席达盛，带领其他工人，成为抢修石景山发电厂六号机的骨干。琉璃河水泥厂翻砂工齐双荣，在训练班时学习了走群众路线。受训回厂，被选为工长。每当他接受了上级分配的任务时，他就和大家一起讨论，集中大家的智慧发挥大家的积极性。过去化铁炉要一个礼拜，现在四天半就可开炉。七十兵工厂工人作水泵铜套，过去的最高纪录是每天四个，王长春学习回厂后，一天作到九个。他并带动工人王秉璋，每天也做到九个。机器三分厂工人李茂堂，学毕回厂，第一天作夜班，就将一夜生产五、六十个螺丝的纪录提高到一百多，改善工具后，更提高到三百十五个。
    为什么这种在过去不可能出现的事情，而在今天发生了呢？这可以看一看训练班学员所谈的他们在解放前后两种绝然不同的政治地位和生活情况。第五期训练班的学员中，有一个十九岁的女工王淑贞，解放前，家贫无生计，父母亲曾两次把她卖给地主家当丫头。十二岁到被服厂当女工，受着各种欺侮与压迫。但是北京解放后，由于她的工作积极，被聘为北京市首届工人代表大会的特邀代表，又当选为市总工会的执行委员。她这种光荣的政治地位，在过去是做梦也想不到的。学员郭玉，是门头沟煤矿的工人。他现在有一个三口人的小家庭，每月可得工资三百三十斤米，过着吃三分之二细粮、三分之一粗粮的生活。解放以前，他也在该矿作工，每月的工资是两袋面粉。但经包工柜压支、扣加粮、扣煤等种种剥削，每月仅实得一点一六袋面粉。这样，他一家四口人，无论如何也是不能维持生活的，他便不顾命地打连班，每天劳动十六小时。母亲、妹妹还得给人家洗衣服。但不到两个月，郭玉累病了，父亲饿死了，母亲与妹妹也逃回房无一间地无一垅的老家。一家人就这样拆散了。
    干训班中每一个学员，都有一段和王淑贞、郭玉相似的历史。但是，究竟大家过去是怎样穷的？自己的血汗到底被人家吸去了多少？许多人在今天以前，都是不十分清楚的。训练班内向学员讲解了劳动创造社会、唯物史观及国家与革命等，提高了学员的阶级觉悟。在学习阶级斗争中，曾着重讲了剩余价值的理论，给工人算了账，让他们明白劳动的成果自己得到了多少？而又让人盘剥了多少？此外，为了避免工人对新民主主义的经济有所误解，又解释了国营企业的社会主义性质及劳资两利的政策。
    根据门头沟煤矿的账目计算，从一九四八年一月至七月，每个工人一月被剥削九袋面粉。老工人阎积栋做了二十八年工，就被剥削了三千多袋面粉，够他全家六口二十九年的生活费用。七十兵工厂老工人路懋作工三十一年，只有四年半的劳动是给他自己干的。这个数字使全班学员大吃一惊，开始清楚地认识了资本主义社会剥削的秘密。
    干训班一年来的经验证明，诉苦运动是进一步提高工人阶级觉悟的主要环节。干训班第五期，于四月二十七日开始了全校诉苦运动。王德有以无限悲愤的心情，倾吐了二十多年来积压在心底的苦水，他说：“我是顺义县人，从小家穷，父亲给人家扛活，少吃没喝。抗日战争爆发后，我为生活所逼，跑到北京，在天桥给人家做工渡日。有一次，警察看见我穿着一身破军装，硬说我是八路军，把我抓了去，他们在板凳上钉了四个钉子，叫我躺上去，钉子对着心口。脑袋、两条腿用绳子勒着，中间用压板压。我死过去几次，鬼子用凉水灌过来。弟兄们！就这样我也没有说出一句话呀！”他接着又说：“还有一次，我被捉到西直门做工，一天晚上，西直门旁边的一个仓库失了火，我去帮忙救火，回来遇上日本宪兵，说是我放了火，他们就抓住我，让洋狗把我腿上的肉都咬掉了。弟兄们，我是死过几死的人了，我真想不到今天能和大家见面，想不到还能找到亲娘，毛主席救了我，我们不要忘掉啊！”他把衣服解开，把裤口挽起，全场的人们瞪着两只哭红了的眼睛，注视着他的伤痕。他心口上还有四个钉印，被洋狗咬掉肉的腿上，有许多青红色的血疤。王德有看着极端悲愤的同学们说：“弟兄们！用不着哭，有了共产党和毛主席的领导，我们工人阶级已作了国家的主人。现在，我已经光荣的参加共产党了，真正找到了自己的亲人！我们要彻底改造旧社会！”
    过去的血迹斑斑的事实，清晰地浮现在每个工人的脑海里。溯本求源，人们更增加了对于今天的革命成果的热爱，工人们说：“要不是毛主席井岗山上插红旗，领导我们闹革命，我们工人那能有今天呢？”经过诉苦后，工人们的眼睛更亮了，更加热爱共产党和毛主席了，好多工人要求入党。在诉苦会上，有的工人用亲切的口吻，向干训班负责同志写了一个条子，要求见见毛主席。条子是这样写的：“共产党毛主席，他在雪山草地，领着作流血斗争，他知道他的儿女们受了苦，所以他今天叫把这些苦说出来，他听听，好拉着我们去要血债，我们在他的怀抱里活到今天，我们想看看亲爱的母亲，我们想母亲也想看看儿女，那怕一分钟也痛快，也光荣，我们总算没有白活，亲眼看见了妈妈也就甘心了！”
