　　Expand and Consolidate Ties with Youth
　　Editorial from "Youth Bolshevik" Magazine, No. 12, 1949
　　The Communist Youth League is now living in those unforgettable, jubilant days. The Bolshevik Party's instructions in the historic congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to the 11th Congress of the Komsomol have encouraged the Komsomol, and it is now stirring up the strength of young patriots to strive for new achievements and to engage in labor wholeheartedly and selflessly for the glory of the socialist motherland. In the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and in the resolutions passed by the 11th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League, the Komsomol organizations have perceived a new expression of the Bolshevik Party's, Comrade Stalin's, care for Soviet youth, a new call from the Party to the youth: to live, work, study, and overcome all difficulties like Lenin and Stalin.
　　What arduous and great tasks are currently placed before the Komsomol, before every Komsomol organization, and before every Komsomol member, male and female!
　　The congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) stated: "Now, when the Soviet people are solving the great tasks of communist construction, the role of the Komsomol in the communist education of the younger generation is becoming increasingly important. The Komsomol should cultivate among the youth fearless, strong, cheerful warriors who believe in their own strength, are prepared to overcome any difficulties, and fight for the freedom and glory of the motherland, for the cause of Lenin and Stalin, and for the victory of communism."
　　The 11th Congress of the Komsomol, in the name of male and female members and of all Soviet youth, assured the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the great leader of the people, the wise teacher, and friend of the youth, Comrade Stalin: the Komsomol and all Soviet youth will dedicate their strength, energy, and intelligence to the interests of the socialist motherland.
　　The Komsomol can only successfully realize Stalin's brilliant plan and fulfill its responsibilities as the Communist Party's fighting assistant under new conditions by tirelessly and constantly strengthening its ties with youth, attracting them to participate in active work, and participating in the nationwide struggle for the victory of communism.
　　Comrade Stalin taught that the entire history of Bolshevism proves that without broad contact with the masses, without constantly consolidating this contact, without being good at listening to the voices of the masses and understanding their pressing needs, and without the awareness of not only teaching the masses but also learning from them, the Bolshevik Party could not become a truly mass party leading millions of Soviet people.
　　In 1937, at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in February and March, when Comrade Stalin spoke about the principle of Bolsheviks maintaining close ties with the masses, he quoted a Greek myth about the hero Antaeus. Antaeus was invincible in his struggle with enemies as long as he touched the earth, touched his mother who bore him. Comrade Stalin said: "I think the Bolsheviks remind us of the hero Antaeus in Greek mythology. They are powerful like Antaeus because they maintain contact with the masses who bore and nurtured them. As long as they maintain contact with their mother, with the people, they will never fail.
　　The key to the invincibility of Bolshevik leadership lies in this."
　　The Komsomol is steadfastly following this most important principle of Bolshevism. Its entire path shows that the Komsomol organizations have been able to successfully complete the tasks set before them by the Party precisely because they have not separated themselves from the broad masses of youth, and on the contrary, have been tirelessly concerned with expanding and consolidating ties with youth.
　　At its 11th Congress, the Komsomol was already a powerful organization, tightly united around the Bolshevik Party, with millions of members. Comrade Mikhailov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Komsomol, listed a series of amazing figures in his report at the 11th Congress. At the 10th Congress of the Komsomol in 1936, there were a total of 201,704 grassroots organizations, uniting nearly four million people. At the 11th Congress of the Komsomol, the number of grassroots organizations had more than doubled, reaching 447,310, and the number of Komsomol members had also increased to 9,283,289. In the last three years alone, 147,000 new Komsomol grassroots organizations have been established, more than 56,000 of which are in the countryside. And how many tens of thousands of people are working in all sectors of the great communist construction today after being educated by the Komsomol!
　　Think carefully about these numbers! The great achievements of the Komsomol's work lie within them. The million-strong army of Soviet patriots, active, conscious, and selfless builders of communism, is cultivated by the Bolshevik Party in the ranks of the Komsomol. Throughout our boundless Soviet land, there is now not a single corner where Komsomol members are not working. Everywhere there are the tireless hands of Komsomol members laboring. Everywhere the never-extinguished torch of the Komsomol is burning.
　　Do these amazing numbers not prove that the Komsomol's influence and prestige among Soviet youth are growing year by year, and that the ties established between the Komsomol organizations and the youth masses are becoming more extensive and lasting? The young men and women of our country recognize that the Komsomol is their long-tested leader, guide, the initiator of great and good causes, of causes needed by the people, and the faithful assistant of the great Lenin-Stalin Party.
　　Consolidating ties with youth – this is the guarantee of future success for the Communist Youth League. The 11th Congress of the All-Union Komsomol emphasized that in order to successfully realize the tasks set before the Komsomol by the Party, strong, combat-capable Komsomol organizations are needed, organizations that are connected to the broad masses of youth by millions of veins. Any Komsomol organization that departs from the interests and needs of youth, that becomes detached from youth, will weaken and perish.
　　Consolidating ties with youth – this means caring for the cultivation of youth at all times, caring for their political and cultural education; it means practically helping them in their work and study, in organizing their leisure time and daily lives; it means understanding well how young people live, what their interests and needs are, and what difficulties they are encountering. A Komsomol leader who loves and respects youth is a true leader. A Komsomol committee that has dozens and hundreds of assistants among the youth, as a true Bolshevik youth organizer, can work successfully.
　　The main task of the Komsomol – is to assist the Party in the cause of communist education of youth. At the current stage, when the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, are realizing the transition from socialism to communism, the Komsomol must make every effort to strengthen the work of communist education of the younger generation. The Komsomol should educate youth in the spirit of the Soviet ideological system, raise their communist consciousness, and resolutely attack the remnants of capitalism in the youth consciousness. The responsibility of the Komsomol – is to develop the youth's boundless love for the Soviet motherland, to cultivate young patriots who can wholeheartedly serve the interests of the motherland, the cause of the great Lenin and Stalin Party in any undertaking.
　　The Bolshevik Party – is the wise mentor, caring teacher, and leader of the Komsomol. The Leninist-Stalinist Komsomol, which has grown into an army of communist builders, owes all its successes and achievements to the Bolshevik Party. All the work of the Komsomol in the communist education of the younger generation should be carried out under the banner of further uniting youth around the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin.
　　The communist education of youth is being realized in the nationwide struggle for the victory of communism. Komsomol members and youth can only receive Bolshevik training through communist education in joint work with all laborers. The Komsomol has strengthened its role in national construction and economic construction, based on the historic resolutions of the 18th Party Congress. The initiative and enthusiasm of the All-Union Komsomol in realizing the tasks of domestic economic and cultural development have grown.
　　The 15th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Komsomol, held in April 1946, instructed that one of the most important tasks of the Komsomol in the post-war years is to absorb all youth into the active work of realizing the new Stalin plan. The plenary session also called on all youth to be filled with the passion for planning and struggle, the passion for construction, and the passion for mastering science and technology.
　　The Komsomol organizations have completed a major political and organizational work, mobilizing youth to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The slogan "Five-Year Plan – Completed in Four Years!" has been enthusiastically embraced by all Soviet youth. Every Komsomol organization is making its contribution to the national work of restoring and further developing the national economy.
　　Socialist competition, as a truly nationwide, the most powerful and invincible movement of modern times, itself contains truly endless possibilities for the communist education of the broad masses of Soviet youth.
　　Kalinov once said to the activists of the Komsomol: "Whoever wants to live for the cause of socialism must create and change life, engage in combat, destroy the old, and create the new. And our Soviet reality provides every worker, every young worker and collective farmer with the possibility to exert the greatest effectiveness, to express and develop their abilities and talents."
　　The task of the Komsomol – is to unfold socialist competition more widely, to pay timely attention to and enthusiastically support all kinds of manifestations of the youth's creative initiative. Comrade Stalin taught that competition is the communist method of socialist construction based on the greatest activism of millions of working masses. The backward receive comrades' assistance from the advanced, so as to achieve universal upsurge, which is a principle of socialist competition. Therefore, some Komsomol organizations mainly do the work of advanced elements in youth workers' teams and high-yield harvest squads, while forgetting all the backward youth, which is a serious mistake. A young worker, who is somewhat backward today, has not yet mastered his profession, and does not understand technology sufficiently, but if the Komsomol organization helps, pays attention to, and supports him in a timely manner, he may and should enter the ranks of the advanced tomorrow.
　　While organizing the socialist competition of youth and attracting a wider stratum of young workers, engineering-technical workers, and staff into this competition movement, the Komsomol organizations should pay special attention to the issues of political work and educational work. It is necessary to ensure the broad openness of the competition. The experience of outstanding workers must be summarized and widely publicized, thereby arming all producers with new working methods. In such a matter, meetings for exchanging work experience, wall newspapers, local radio, and various forms of figurative propaganda should play a role.
　　In the post-war years, the Komsomol has achieved many new achievements in the production technology training of youth. In the last three years alone, six million new workers of various professions have been trained. Twelve million workers have improved their skills, of which 60 percent are young people. Ensuring further improvement of the production technology training of young producers – this is an important national task of the Komsomol. The Komsomol organizations should use all methods to strive to take into account the new technical achievements, the experience of advanced enterprises, and the methods of production innovators in the prescribed courses of production training classes and schools; to strive to make production technology training adapt to the high demands currently placed on it. Let every Komsomol member, every young worker improve their production knowledge and study diligently and systematically to master their profession.
　　The tasks of the Komsomol members in the countryside are also very great and important. The Komsomol in the countryside – is a huge force. It now has more than 200,000 Komsomol organizations, uniting 2.2 million young members. Komsomol organizations have been established in all collective farms, state farms, and tractor stations in 54 provinces, border regions, and republics. It is necessary to strengthen the Komsomol's ties with rural youth day by day, and it is necessary to establish Komsomol organizations in all collective farms in the near future. The task of the Komsomol – is to attract all rural youth to participate in the socialist competition movement to strive for high Stalinist harvests, strive for increased production and increased numbers of public livestock, and participate in the further socialist transformation of the countryside. The Komsomol must help the Party mobilize all rural youth to fight for agricultural abundance and to improve agricultural culture on the basis of the widespread implementation of Michurin agricultural science.
　　Rural Komsomol, how many real national affairs are waiting for you! Consolidate your friendship with all rural youth! Stir up the strength of young patriots to work self-sacrificingly for the glory of the motherland! Let our Soviet motherland be richer, happier, stronger, and more abundant!
　　Political education is the most important condition for the communist education of youth, the means of consolidating the Komsomol's ties with all youth, and the means of attracting youth to actively participate in social and national life. In the post-war period, the Komsomol, following the historically significant decisions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on ideology, significantly improved the work of Marxist-Leninist propaganda among youth. In this regard, the 17th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Komsomol, held in September 1948, played a great role, at which the issue of the political education of Komsomol members and youth was discussed. Political study in the Komsomol has gained tremendous scale. About 240,000 political study groups and political schools are working in the Komsomol organizations. In 1949, more than four million Komsomol members and youth studied in them.
　　Political education helps the Komsomol strengthen the spiritual strength of youth, cultivate the communist outlook on life of young men and women, and combine them with the great knowledge treasury of Marxism-Leninism. The reality of life irrefutably proves that only those Komsomol organizations that engage in the political education of all youth at all times, unswervingly, and systematically can successfully solve the task of communist education of the younger generation.
　　The current task lies in the fact that the Komsomol committees must deeply analyze the summary of the academic year that is about to end for the Komsomol political education network, and without putting things on the shelf, start preparing for the new academic year immediately. Our youth's interest in political knowledge and in studying the foundations of Marxism-Leninism is enormous and constantly increasing. It is necessary to help young workers, young collective farmers, and young staff master the science of Marxism-Leninism; it is necessary to open the doors of political study groups and political schools to youth; it is necessary to achieve: the quality of Komsomol political study is constantly improved, lectures and seminars are rich in content and interesting, inspire listeners with lively creative thoughts, and cultivate their interest in theory.
　　In order to train comprehensively developed, conscious, and active builders of communism, it is necessary to combine all youth with knowledge, culture, and science. The primary task of the Komsomol is to help the Bolshevik Party consolidate and develop schools, improve teaching and training work among students, and implement the law on universal education for children.
　　The 11th Congress of the All-Union Komsomol specially pointed out the importance of night schools for working youth and rural youth; in the years these night schools have been working, 300,000 young people have completed seven-year schools and secondary schools education in them. Night schools need great assistance from the Komsomol. But there are still such situations: that is, in violation of the instructions of the Soviet Council of Ministers, students are still required to engage in overtime work and are not given holidays for exams. In a series of schools, especially in the Altai Territory, Vladimir and Kemerovo Oblast, there are still a large number of students being eliminated. The Komsomol organizations cannot ignore these facts. The Komsomol committees must more boldly raise all issues related to the work of night schools to the Party organs and Soviet organs, and solve them more effectively. Caring for the education of working youth and rural youth – is the Komsomol's own business.
　　Mass cultural and educational work is an important means of communist education for youth. In raising the people's culture and meeting the people's spiritual needs, which country has achieved such grand achievements as ours? Our country has established tens of thousands of libraries, more than 100,000 cultural palaces and cultural houses, clubs, and rural reading rooms to serve the Soviet people. The amateur artistic activities of the working people and mass creativity have reached a truly all-people scale in our country. But some Komsomol organizations still do not make good use of these richest possibilities. But there are still some organizations in which amateur artistic activity groups do not work, and rarely hold youth rest evenings and reading discussion meetings. Here, dryness and boredom dominate. Youth cannot spend their leisure time interestingly and meaningfully. The responsibility of the Komsomol is to fully improve and develop mass cultural work for youth, to ensure the broad scale and high ideological level of this work.
　　A good Komsomol leader should take into account the interests and needs of youth in his work, and constantly study the demands of youth. The Komsomol leader – is a caring friend, a compatible comrade, and an organizer of youth.
　　The Komsomol works among youth of different ages and various professions. The interests and needs of youth are also various and broad. There is no other country with such active, inquisitive, and cheerful youth as ours. Therefore, nothing is more harmful to the education of young men and women than the obsolete methods in work and the use of a common yardstick to deal with everything. The Komsomol organizations must not lead youth in general, but specifically and differentially, taking into account the needs and characteristics of each type of youth.
　　The expansion of the All-Union Komsomol ranks is first of all a manifestation of the consolidation of the Komsomol organizations' ties with youth. The aspiration of the advancing Soviet youth for the Komsomol is enormous. Only in the months before the 11th Congress, hundreds of thousands of new members joined the Komsomol, which is the most obvious example of this.
　　However, the Komsomol grassroots are still insufficient in certain types of youth groups. In many collective farms, Komsomol grassroots organizations have not yet been established. All of this shows that there are still many major shortcomings in our work, and some Komsomol organizations have weak ties with youth.
　　The issues of Komsomol growth are closely related to the level and content of all work of the Komsomol grassroots organizations. The entire surrounding actual life attracts young men and women to the Komsomol. But youth also judges the Komsomol by the work of the Komsomol grassroots organization where he or she works or studies. Therefore, where the grassroots organizations can meet the interests and needs of youth, there are often people requesting to join the Komsomol. To make every Komsomol grassroots organization grow systematically, this means first of all to make every organization a combat organization, an automatic organization, an organization that can take care of the interests of youth, and can build its work vigorously and attractively.
　　Not long ago, the Central Committee of the All-Union Komsomol listened to the work report of the Komsomol Smolensk Provincial Committee. In the past, the Central Committee had instructed the Smolensk Provincial Committee that it must consolidate the grassroots organizations, pointing out that this is a decisive condition for improving all the work of the provincial Komsomol organization. The provincial committee did not implement these instructions, and the entire work of consolidating and establishing Komsomol organizations was carried out by them in a lukewarm manner.
　　As a result, in many collective farms in the province, there are no Komsomol organizations, and a series of grassroots organizations are composed of only three to five members.
　　The 11th Congress, as an important event in the life of the Komsomol and all youth, has aroused a great increase in the labor activism and political activism of young men and women in our country. Now, the task of the Komsomol organizations is to consolidate this increase in an organized manner, and attract new tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of youth to the ranks of the Komsomol. The amendments added to the Komsomol Charter make the Komsomol organization even more able to strengthen its influence on the broad youth strata. For this, it is first necessary to take the task of consolidating ties with youth and the task of constantly expanding the ranks of the Komsomol as the focus of attention of every Komsomol organization. Obviously, only those district committees and municipal committees are good at handling this task smoothly, whose leaders do not study the needs and interests of youth by working in the office, but work daily in the places where youth gather, that is, in any place where youth work, study, and rest. Whether the dormitories of young workers are well-equipped, whether the enterprise administration sponsors this or that valuable initiative of young producers, where and how young people spend their leisure time, and whether the necessary conditions for their study have been created – all these and many other issues should constantly attract the attention of the Komsomol leaders and receive timely responses from them.
　　The district committees and municipal committees of the Komsomol should raise the responsibility of every Komsomol organization for the growth of the Komsomol. Every Komsomol member must be made aware of his responsibility for expanding his own Komsomol organization and his responsibility for the growth of the Komsomol ranks. Next to every Komsomol member – in the same work team and work shift, in the same group – there are young men and women who have not joined the Komsomol working. The responsibility of the Komsomol member is to show them the greatest concern, to care for them in a comradely manner, to cultivate them to participate in the Komsomol, and to introduce them. The Komsomol organizations cannot limit their activities to a small circle of activists, but must work among all youth, and work for every young worker, young collective farmer, university student, or middle school student.
　　In order to be able to cope with the needs in the future, and in order to be able to gloriously fulfill the great and responsible tasks put forward by the Party, the Komsomol must fully consolidate and expand its ties with youth. This is the decisive condition for success in our work.

　　扩大和巩固与青年的联系
　　青年布尔什维克杂志一九四九年第十二期社论
    现在共产主义青年团正生活在那永志不忘的、欢欣鼓舞的日子里。联共（布）中央给予团第十一次代表大会的历史性祝词中的布尔什维克党的指示，鼓励了共青团，现在它正掀起青年爱国者的力量，争取新的功绩，为社会主义祖国的光荣而热诚地忘我地从事劳动。在联共（布）中央的祝词中，在全苏列宁共产主义青年团第十一次代表大会所通过的议决案中，共青团的组织体察到布尔什维克党，斯大林同志对于苏维埃青年的关怀之新的表示，党对于青年的新的号召，这就是：要像列宁、斯大林那样地生活、工作、学习和战胜一切困难。
    当前摆在共青团面前，摆在每一个共青团组织的前面，摆在每一个共青团男女团员面前的任务是怎样繁巨而伟大啊！
    在联共（布）中央委员会的祝词中说：“现在，当苏维埃人民正在解决共产主义建设的伟大任务的时候，共青团在青年一代的共产主义教育事业中的作用就日益增大。共青团应当在青年中培养出大无畏的、坚强的、生活愉快的、相信自己力量、准备克服任何困难、为争取祖国的自由和光荣、为列宁和斯大林党的事业、争取共产主义的胜利而斗争的战士”。
    共青团第十一次代表大会曾以男女团员的名义，以全体苏维埃青年的名义，向联共（布）中央委员会，伟大的人民领袖、英明的导师和青年的朋友斯大林同志保证：共青团以及全体苏维埃青年，定将为社会主义祖国的利益，献出自己的力量、精力和智识。
    而共青团只有在始终不倦地、天天加强自己与青年的联系，吸引他们参加积极的工作，参加为争取共产主义的胜利的全民斗争的情形下，才能顺利地实现斯大林的天才计划，才能在新的条件上完成共产党的战斗助手的职责。
    斯大林同志教导说，布尔什维主义的全部历史证明：不与群众发生广泛的联系，不经常巩固这种联系，不善于倾听群众的呼声和了解他们的迫切需要，没有不仅教导群众而且向群众学习的觉悟，那么，布尔什维克党就不可能成为领导千百万苏维埃人们的真正群众的党。
    一九三七年在联共（布）中央委员会二三月的全体会议上，斯大林同志讲到密切联系群众的布尔什维克的原则的时候，曾引用了关于英雄安泰的一段希腊神话。安泰在与敌人斗争中，只要他，触及到土地，触及到生养他的母亲，他都是不可战胜的。斯大林同志说：“我想，布尔什维克们使我们想起希腊神话的英雄安泰。他们，如像安泰一样之所以有力，乃是因为与生养和培育他们的群众保持着联系。只要他们与自己的母亲，与人民保持着联系，他们就永远不会失败。
    布尔什维主义领导之不可战胜性的关键就在于此。”
    共青团正在坚定不移地遵循着布尔什维主义这一条最重要的原则。它的全部道路表明，共青团的组织之所以曾能够顺利地完成党在他们面前所提出的任务，正是因为他们没有脱离广大的青年群众，而且恰恰相反，一直不倦地关怀着扩大和巩固与青年的联系。
    共青团在其第十一次代表大会时，已是紧紧团结在布尔什维克党周围、人数达数百万的、强大的组织了。全苏共青团中央委员会书记米哈依洛夫同志在第十一次代表大会的报告中，列举了一系列的惊人的数字。一九三六年共青团第十次代表大会时，共计有二十万一千七百零四个基层组织，团结了将近四百万人。而共青团第十一次代表大会时，基层组织的数目已超过一倍以上，计达四十四万七千三百一十个，而其中共青团团员的人数也增加到九百二十八万三千二百八十九人。仅仅最近三年来，就建立了十四万七千个新的共青团基层组织，其中有五万六千个以上在乡村。而经过共青团教育，今天在伟大的共产主义建设的所有部门工作着的人们，又有多少万啊！
    请仔细思考这些数字吧！共青团工作的伟大成果就在其中。苏维埃的爱国者，共产主义的积极的、自觉的、忘我的建设者之百万大军，是布尔什维克党在共青团的行列中培养出来的。在整个我们苏维埃的无边无际的土地上，现在找不到一个没有共青团员在那儿工作的角落。到处都有共青团团员们的永不倦怠的双手在劳动着。到处燃烧着共青团的永不熄灭的火炬。
    难道这些惊人的数字不正是说明共青团在苏维埃青年中的影响和威信在逐年增长，共青团的组织与青年群众所建立的联系在越发广泛而持久吗？我们国家的男女青年们认定共青团乃是自己的久经考验的领导者，指导者，伟大而良好的事业、人民所需要的事业的首创者，伟大的列宁——斯大林党的忠实助手。
    巩固与青年的联系——这即是共产主义青年团未来成功的保证。全苏共青团第十一次代表大会曾经强调指出，为了顺利实现党在共青团面前所提出的任务，就需要坚强的、有战斗能力的共青团的组织，这些组织是以千万条脉络与广大的青年群众联系着的。任何一个共青团组织，假使它离开了青年的利益和需要，脱离了青年，那它便要衰弱、便要灭亡。
    巩固与青年的联系——这就是说要时时刻刻关心培养青年，关心他们的政治和文化教育，就是说要在青年们的工作和学习中，在组织他们的空暇和日常生活中，实际地帮助他们；这就是说，要很好地了解青年怎样生活，他们的兴趣和需要是怎样的，他们正遭遇着什么样的困难。一个爱护和尊重青年的共青团领导者，方才是一个真正的领袖。一个作为真正布尔什维克的青年组织者，在青年中拥有数十和数百助手的共青团委员会，方能顺利地工作。
    共青团的主要任务——乃是在青年的共产主义教育的事业中去协助党。在现阶段，即当苏维埃人民正在布尔什维克党的领导下实现从社会主义过渡到共产主义的时期，共青团须要全力加强年青一代的共产主义教育的工作。共青团应当以苏维埃思想体系的精神教育青年，提高他们的共产主义的自觉性，坚决地进攻青年意识中的资本主义残余。共青团的责任——就是发展青年对于苏维埃祖国无限热爱的情感，培养能在任何种事业上无限热诚为祖国的利益，为伟大的列宁和斯大林的党的事业服务的青年爱国者。
    布尔什维克党——是共青团的英明导师，关心的教师和领导者。已壮大为共产主义建设者的大军的列斯共青团，其所有自己的成功和成就都应归功于布尔什维克党。共青团在青年一代共产主义教育方面的全部工作，应当进一步把青年团结在布尔什维克党、苏维埃政府周围，团结在斯大林同志周围的标志下来进行。
    青年的共产主义教育正在为争取共产主义的胜利的全民的斗争中实现着。共青团的团员们和青年们只有在与所有的劳动者共同的工作中，才能通过共产主义教育的训练，得到布尔什维克的锻炼。共青团以第十八次党代表大会的历史性的决议为基础，在国家建设和经济建设中，加强了自己的作用。全苏共青团在实现国内经济和文化发展的任务中的首创精神和积极性，已经增长起来了。
    一九四六年四月召开的共青团中央第十五次全体会议曾经指示，战后几年共青团的一个最重要的任务，就是把所有的青年都吸收到实现新的斯大林计划的积极工作中来。全体会议并曾号召全体青年要充满着计划而斗争的热情，建设的热情，掌握科学与技术的热情。
    共青团组织已经完成了一件重大的政治工作和组织的工作，动员了青年提前完成战后五年计划。“五年计划——四年完成！”的口号，已被全体苏维埃青年热烈地掌握住了。每一个共青团组织都在恢复和进一步发展国家国民经济的全民工作上，拿出自己的贡献。
    作为真正全民性的、现代最强大而无敌的运动的社会主义竞赛，本身就包藏着广大苏维埃青年群众的共产主义教育之真正无穷无尽的可能性。
    加里宁曾经对共青团的积极分子说：“谁愿意为社会主义的工作而生活，他就要创造和改变生活，从事战斗，破坏旧的，创设新的。而我们的苏维埃的现实，向每一劳动者，每一个青年工人和集体农民提供着发挥最大的效力，表现和发展自己的能力和天才的可能。”
    共青团的任务——乃是更广泛地展开社会主义竞赛，及时注意和热心支持青年的创造性的首创精神之各种各样表现。斯大林同志教导说，竞赛是以千百万劳动群众的最大的积极性为基础的社会主义建设之共产主义的方法。落后的从先进的方面得到同志的帮助，借以达到普遍的高涨，这就是社会主义竞赛的一个原则。因此，有些共青团组织主要是作青年工人工作班、高额收获小队中的先进分子的工作，而忘却了所有落后的青年，这便犯了严重的错误。一个青年工人，今天多少有些落后，还没有精通自己的职业，没有足够地了解技术，但假使共青团的组织及时帮助、注意和支持他，明天他就可能而且应当走进先进的队伍。
    共青团组织一面组织青年的社会主义竞赛，把青年工人，工程——技术工作者，职员中的更广泛的阶层，吸引到这一竞赛运动中，同时应当特别注意政治工作和教育工作的问题。须要保证竞赛的广泛的公开性。必须概括和广泛地宣传优秀工人的经验，借此以新的工作方法来武装所有生产者。在这样一件事情中，交换工作经验的会议，墙报，本地方的无线电和各种不同的具象的鼓动的手段，都应发挥作用。
    战后数年内，共青团在青年的生产技术训练中，已经达到了许多新的成就。仅只在最近三年来，就训练了六百万各种职业的新工人。有一千二百万工人提高了自己的熟练程度。其中百分之六十是青年。保证进一步改善青年生产者的生产技术的训练——这就是共青团的一项重要的国家任务。共青团的组织应当用一切方法力求在生产训练班和学校的规定课程中，照顾到新的技术成就、先进企业的经验，生产革新者的方法；力求使生产技术的训练能适应于目前向它提出的高度要求。让每一个共青团员、每一个青年工人提高自己的生产知识、坚韧而有系统地学习精通自己的职业吧。
    农村的共青团团员们的任务也同样是非常伟大而重要的。农村中的共青团——是一支巨大的力量。它现在共计有二十万以上的共青团组织，团结了二百二十万青年团员。在五十四个省、边区和共和国的所有集体农场、国营农场、拖拉机站中都已建立起共青团组织。须要使共青团与农村青年的联系日益加强，须要能在最近期内在所有的集体农场中建立起共青团组织。共青团的任务——就是吸引所有的农村青年参加为争取高度的斯大林式的收获，争取公共牧畜业的产量提高、头数增加之社会主义竞赛运动，参加乡村的更进一步的社会主义改造的工作。共青团必须帮助党动员所有乡村青年为争取农产丰裕，争取在广泛实施米邱林农业科学的基础上提高农业文化而斗争。
    乡村的共青团，多么多的、真正的国家事务在等待着你啊！巩固自己对所有乡村青年的友谊吧！掀动青年爱国者们的力量去为祖国的荣誉而自我牺牲地工作吧！让我们苏维埃祖国更富有更幸福，更强大更丰裕吧！
    政治教育乃是青年共产主义教育的最重要的条件，乃是巩固共青团与一切青年联系的手段、吸引青年积极参加社会生活和国家生活的手段。在战后时期，共青团遵循联共（布）中央关于思想体系的具有历史意义的决定，显著地改善了在青年中的马列主义宣传工作。在这方面，一九四八年九月举行的共青团中央第十七次全体会议起了很大的作用，在该大会上，曾讨论了关于共青团员与青年的政治教育问题。共青团里的政治学习获得了极大的规模。在共青团组织中约有二十四万个政治学习小组和政治学校在工作。在一九四九年曾有四百多万的共青团员和青年在其中学习。
    政治教育帮助着共青团加强青年们的精神力量，培养青年男女的共产主义人生观，使他们与马列主义的伟大的知识宝库相结合。生活的实际无可辩驳地证明，只有那些时时刻刻、不屈不挠、有系统地从事全体青年政治教育的共青团组织，方才顺利地解决青年一代共产主义教育的任务。
    现在的任务是在于，共青团委员会要深刻地分析共青团政治教育网即将结束的学年的总结，并且别把事情置诸高阁，要立刻开始准备新的学年。我们的青年对于政治知识，对于学习马列主义基础的兴趣，是巨大的并且是不断增加着的。必须帮助青年工人，青年集体农民，青年职员掌握马列主义的科学；必须对青年敞开政治学习小组和政治学校之门；必须达到：共青团政治学习的品质不断提高，讲演会和座谈会富有内容和富有兴趣，鼓舞听讲者生动的创造性的思想，培养他们对理论的兴趣。
    为了要训练全面发展的、自觉的而积极的共产主义建设者，必须使一切青年与知识、文化、科学相结合。共青团的首要任务，就是帮助布尔什维克党巩固和发展学校，改善在学生中的教学培养工作，实施关于儿童普遍教育的法律。
    全苏共青团第十一次代表大会曾特别指出工人青年和乡村青年夜校工作的重要性；在这些夜校工作的诸年来，已有三十万青年在其中完成了七年制学校的和中等学校的教育。夜校需要共青团方面大大的协助。但还有这样一些情形存在：这就是违背苏联部长会议的指示，仍然要学生从事加班工作，并且不给他们考试的假期。在一系列的学校中，尤其是在阿尔泰边区，弗拉几米尔和克墨罗夫州，仍旧有大批淘汰学生的事情发生。共青团组织不可忽视这些事实。共青团委员会必须更大胆地将与夜校工作相关的一切问题提给党的机关和苏维埃的机关，并更有效地解决它们。关怀工人青年和乡村青年的教育，——是共青团的切身事情。
    群众性的文教工作是青年共产主义教育的重要手段。在提高人民文化、满足人民的精神需要一事中，还有那一个国家达到了如像我国这样宏大的成就呢？我们国家成立了几万所图书馆、十万所以上的文化宫和文化之家、俱乐部、乡村阅览室为苏维埃人民服务。劳动人民的业余艺术活动、群众性的创造在我国达到了真正全体人民的规模。但是某些共青团组织，仍旧不好好地利用这些最丰富的可能性。但还有这样些组织，在它们中间没有业余艺术活动小组工作，很少举办青年休息晚会和读书讨论会。这里是枯燥无聊支配着。青年不能够有趣味地和有内容地渡过自己的闲暇。共青团的责任是全力改善和发展对青年的群众文化工作，保证这项工作的广大规模、高度的思想水平。
    一个好的共青团领导者，应在工作中顾到青年的兴趣和需要，经常研究青年的要求。共青团的领导者——就是青年的关心的朋友、投合的同志和组织者。
    共青团在不同年龄的和各种各样职业的青年中工作。青年的兴趣和需要也是各种各样的和广泛的。没有任何一个其他的国家有像我国这样活动的、喜好钻研的、生活愉快的青年。所以，没有什么东西比较工作中的陈腐方式以及用一个共同的尺度来处理一切更为有害于青年男女的教育事业了。共青团组织，必须不是一般的，而是具体地、有差别地领导青年，要顾到每一类青年的需要和特点。
    全苏共青团队伍的扩大首先是共青团组织与青年联系巩固的表现。前进的苏维埃青年对于共青团之渴慕是巨大的。只是在十一次代表大会以前的数月内，就有数十万新团员参加了共青团，这就是这一点的最显明的实例。
    然而，共青团基层在某些种青年群中仍然是不够的。在许多集体农庄中，迄今还没有建立起共青团基层组织。这一切都说明，在我们的工作中还有许多重大的缺点，有些个共青团组织同青年的联系还很弱。
    共青团成长的诸问题，是与共青团基层组织的一切工作之水平与内容紧密地联系着的。整个周围的实际生活吸引着青年男女到共青团中去。但是青年也是以他所工作或学习的那个地方的团基层组织的工作，来判断共青团的。所以，那里的基层组织能满足青年的兴趣和需要，那里就时常有请求入团的人。要作到每一个共青团基层组织有系统地成长，这就是说首先要使每一个组织成为战斗的组织、自动的组织、能够顾到青年的兴趣，并能生气勃勃地、惹人心动地建树自己工作的组织。
    不久以前，全苏共青团中央听取了共青团斯摩棱斯克省委的工作报告。过去，中央委员会曾指示斯摩棱斯克省委员会必须巩固基层组织，指出这乃是提高省共青团组织的全部工作的决定性条件。省委没有执行这些指示，巩固和建立共青团组织的全部工作，被他们忽冷忽热地进行。
    结果，该省许多集体农场中，都没有共青团组织，一系列基层组织仅由三至五个团员组成。
    作为共青团和全体青年的生活中一个重要事件的第十一次代表大会，引起了我国男女青年在劳动积极性和政治积极性上的巨大提高。现在，共青团组织的任务是在于，有组织地巩固这个提高，吸引新的几万、几十万青年到共青团的行列中来。团章内所加的修改，使得团组织更能加强其对广大青年阶层的影响。为了这，首先必须把巩固与青年联系的任务，把经常扩充共青团行列的任务，作为每一个共青团组织注意的中心点。显然，只要那样的区委和市委才善于顺利处理这一任务，这一区委或市委的领导者不是以坐办公室的方法来研究青年的需要和兴趣，而是日常地在青年丛集的地方工作，即在任何青年们所劳作、学习和休息的地方工作。青年工人们的宿舍是不是设备良好，企业行政上是不是赞助青年生产者的这种或那种有价值的创举，青年在那儿并怎样渡过自己的闲暇时间，是不是已经创设了他们学习的必要条件——这一切以及许多其他问题，都应当经常引起共青团领导者的注意，并从他们方面得到适时的反应。
    共青团的区委、市委应提高每一个共青团组织对于共青团成长的责任。必须使每一个共青团员意识到为自己在扩充自己共青团组织方面的责任，和自己对共青团行列之成长的责任。与每一个共青团员并列——在同一个工作队和工作班里，在同一个小组里——都有未参加团的青年男女们在工作。共青团员的责任，是对他们表现最大地关心，同志般地关怀着他们，培养他们参加共青团，给他们作介绍。共青团组织不能把自己的活动局限在积极分子的小圈子里，必须要在一切青年中工作，要对每一个青年工人、青年集体农民、大学生或中学生工作。
    为了今后亦能应付需要，为了今后亦能光荣地执行党所提出的伟大的和负责任的任务，共青团必须全力巩固和扩大与青年的联系。这就是我们工作中成功的决定条件。
