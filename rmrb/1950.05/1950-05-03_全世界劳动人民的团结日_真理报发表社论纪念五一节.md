Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st - TASS reports: On April 30th, the Truth Daily published an editorial entitled "International Labor Day", commemorating May Day.

Truth Daily first pointed out the unprecedented strength of international democratic forces demonstrated in this year's May Day, stating: The strength of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp has never been as great as it is today.

The Soviet people are commemorating May Day with new and great victories in all aspects of communist construction. The development of the Soviet national economy has become increasingly rapid. It has not only reached but also greatly exceeded the pre-war level of the national economy. Under the glorious leadership of the party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people are confidently marching towards the victory of communism, pointing out to the working people of the world the road to freedom and happiness. Following the road of building socialism and relying on the fraternal assistance and experience of the world's first socialist country, the people's democratic countries have made significant achievements in building a new and free life.

The great Chinese people, who have broken the shackles of enslavement and oppression, are freely celebrating May Day for the first time in their history this year.

The Chinese Communist Party's liberation struggle, leading the Chinese people, has lasted for almost thirty years. During this period, it led hundreds of millions of Chinese working masses through hardships in their struggle against imperialism and its Kuomintang servants. This heroic struggle has won a historically significant victory, bringing about the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The Communist Party has opened the road to socialism for the Chinese people. There is no doubt that, relying on the unbreakable, fraternal alliance with the Soviet Union, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will also succeed in building a new life.

The working people of the German Democratic Republic are celebrating May Day in a new environment. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic has created the necessary conditions for unifying Germany into a single democratic state. The working people of the German Democratic Republic and millions of German patriots in West Germany, under the banner of the National Front, will demonstrate on May Day their determination to fight for a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and for peace against war instigators.

The flames of the struggle against imperialist enslavement and for the people's peace and freedom are burning ever more brightly in every capitalist country.

Countries around the world are commemorating this year's May Day under the slogan of "Mobilizing the forces of all peace-loving people to fight for peace." The forces of freedom-loving people are closely uniting their ranks under the banner of fighting for peace. All those who truly fight for peace participate in the powerful and ever-expanding movement to defend peace. At present, the struggle for peace revolves around the demand to ban atomic weapons. The mass movement of signing the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress is also a central link in the overall activities of the people's masses to defend peace.

Truth Daily further pointed out: The struggle for peace and against the instigators of new wars is inextricably linked to the people's struggle for democracy and socialism. People all over the world are increasingly convinced that the struggle for peace is also a struggle for the vital interests of the working class and all working people. Under the leadership of the Communist Parties of various countries, more and more working people are rising up to actively fight against imperialism and stand under the red flag that will bring freedom and happiness to all mankind.

　　全世界劳动人民的团结日
    真理报发表社论纪念五一节
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于四月三十日以“全世界劳动人民的团结日”，发表社论，纪念五一劳动节。
    真理报首先指出国际民主力量在今年“五一”表现的空前强大力量称：民主反帝阵营的力量从来没有像今天这样强大。
    苏联人民以共产主义建设各方面新的、巨大的胜利，来纪念五一节。苏联国民经济的发展已越来越迅速了。现在已不仅达到了而且还大大超过了国民经济的战前水平。在光荣的列宁与斯大林党的领导下，苏联人民正充满信心地迈向共产主义的胜利，给全世界的劳动人民指出通往自由与幸福的大道。遵循着建设社会主义的大道而倚靠着世界上第一个社会主义国家的兄弟般帮助和经验，人民民主国家在建设新的、自由的生活方面已经获得了重大成就。
    打破了奴役与压迫之枷锁的伟大中国人民，今年在他们有史以来第一次，自由地庆祝五一节。
    中国共产党领导中国人民进行的解放斗争，差不多已经有三十年了。在这期间，它领导着亿万中国劳动群众历经千辛万苦向帝国主义及其国民党从仆进行斗争。这一英勇的斗争已赢得了有历史意义的胜利，带来了中华人民共和国的成立。共产党已经为中国人民打开了通往社会主义的大道。毫无疑问，倚靠和苏联牢不可破的、兄弟般联盟，中国人民在共产党领导之下，也将在建设新生活方面获得成功。
    德意志民主共和国的劳动人民在新的环境中庆祝五一节。德意志民主共和国的成立，为使德国统一为单一的民主的国家创造了必要条件。德意志民主共和国的劳动人民和西德数以百万计的德国爱国者，在全国阵线的旗帜下，在五一节那天将表现他们为争取一个统一、独立、民主、爱好和平的德意志，为争取和平反对战争挑拨者而斗争的决心。
    反对帝国主义的奴役、争取人民的和平和自由的斗争火焰，越来越更燃遍了各个资本主义国家。
    全世界各国是在“动员一切爱好和平人民的力量来为和平而斗争”的口号下纪念今年的五一节。爱好自由的人民的力量正在为和平而斗争的旗帜下紧密他们的队伍。凡是真正为和平而斗争的人，都参加强大的、不断扩大着的拥护和平运动。目前争取和平的斗争正围绕着禁止原子武器的要求。在世界拥护和平大会常委会呼吁书上签名的群众运动，同时也是人民群众保卫和平的总的活动的中心环节。
    真理报继指出：争取和平、反对新战争挑拨者的斗争，是和人民争取民主与社会主义的斗争不可分地联系着的。全世界人民正日益相信，争取和平的斗争同时也是工人阶级和一切劳动人民切身利益的斗争。在各国共产党的领导下，愈来愈多的劳动人民正在起来为反对帝国主义而积极斗争，站到将给全人类带来自由与幸福的红旗之下。
