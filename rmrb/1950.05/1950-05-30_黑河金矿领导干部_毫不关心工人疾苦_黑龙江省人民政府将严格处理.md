【Heilongjiang News】 Heilongjiang Daily News: The leaders of the Heihe Gold Mine are not concerned about the suffering and safety of the workers. Around the Lunar New Year, there were a series of serious incidents in which six workers died. This incident was raised at the Provincial People's Representative Conference, and the Provincial Administrative Committee has resolved to deal with it strictly. The Provincial Federation of Trade Unions has now instructed the Heihe Federation of Trade Unions to send someone to investigate. The mine has no safety equipment and workers are often crushed to death. The medical equipment in the mine is extremely poor. There are only six or seven clinics for twenty mines, and the mines are two or three hundred miles apart. Workers cannot get timely treatment when they are sick. Workers work as long as thirteen or fourteen hours, and their physical strength cannot be restored. The supply of grain and other necessities to the mine is not timely. Cotton clothes are issued in the summer and single clothes in the winter, and many workers get sick. The leading cadres of the mine actually believe that this serious situation has nothing to do with them. Three workers in the Second Branch Mine of the First Branch Bureau have died of Keshan disease. When the trade union asked the mine director to find a way to treat them, the mine director Li Duo said: "The workers' illness has nothing to do with me, I don't care!" Workers cannot get treatment when they are sick, and minor illnesses often become major illnesses. Two patients couldn't bear the pain and committed suicide. During the Spring Festival, old worker Zhao Yunjiu wanted to borrow some money to buy things, and the administrative负责人 [responsible person] said: "Who told you to have no money?" The trade union helped Zhao to request it, but it was ineffective, and Zhao Yunjiu went home and hanged himself in anger. After Zhao Yunjiu's death, the trade union asked the administrative side to provide a coffin for burial, but the mine director Li Duo said: "I don't care! I won't give it! What contribution have the workers made to us?" The workers all said sadly: "What time is this? Are we still suffering such oppression?!"

(Editor's note: The bureaucratic mistakes of the leaders of the Heihe Gold Mine, who disregard the lives and deaths of workers, are intolerable. They have completely lost the position of leaders of state-owned enterprises. This serious situation should be changed quickly. The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government's decision to strictly deal with this incident is very correct. We hope that the results of the handling will be announced in the newspaper as soon as possible.)

　　黑河金矿领导干部
    毫不关心工人疾苦
    黑龙江省人民政府将严格处理
    【黑龙江讯】黑龙江日报消息：黑河金矿领导人，不关心工人疾苦和生命安全，旧历年前后，该矿连续发生死亡六名工人的严重事件。此事件经省人民代表会议提出，省行政委员会已决议严格处理。该省总工会现已责成黑河总工会，派专人前往调查。该矿毫无安全设备，经常砸死工人。矿内医疗设备极坏，二十个矿只有六、七个医疗所，而矿与矿相隔有二、三百里者。工人有病，得不到及时的治疗。工人工作时间长达十三、四小时，体力得不到恢复。该矿粮食等供应不及时，夏发棉衣冬发单衣，工人患病者甚多。该矿领导干部竟认为这种严重情况和他没有关系。一分局二分矿工人得克山病，已死三人。工会向矿长要求想法治疗，矿长李铎说：“工人有病与我无关，不管！”工人患病得不到治疗，小病常拖成大病。有两个病号受不了疼苦，竟自杀了。过春节时，老工人赵云九想借点钱买东西，行政负责人说：“谁叫你没钱的？”工会帮助赵去请求，也无效果，气的赵云九回家就吊死了。赵云九死后，工会要求行政方面给棺成殓，矿长李铎说：“不管！不给！工人对咱有啥贡献？”工人们都沉痛地说：“这是什么时候呀，我们还受这样的压迫？！”
    （编者按：黑河金矿领导人这种不顾工人死活的官僚主义错误，是不能令人容忍的。他们完全丧失了国家企业领导人的立场。应该迅速改变这种严重情况。黑龙江省人民政府决定严格处理这一事件，是很对的。希望迅速将处理结果，在报纸上公布。）
