　　On the Road to Production Advance
　　He Keran Ke Er
　　A certain unit of the North China People's Liberation Army decided to go to Shanyin County to dig canals and participate in national water conservancy construction. Before departing, the comrades were thinking: "Take the train? Or march?"
　　After careful consideration, they made a decision: "Don't take the train."
　　The 600-li journey would take ten days to walk. If they first took the train to Datong, they could walk seven or eight days less. However, the comrades thought: the entire unit taking the train would cost more than 500,000 jin of millet in train fare, and it would also affect the country's transportation work. We are going to participate in production to increase the country's wealth and reduce the burden on the people, so let's save this train fare for the people first. Comrade Xie Genhai said it well: "We are the people's soldiers and should think of the people in everything. Instead of taking the train, we should carry forward our glorious tradition and walk, and use this money to help the disaster victims."
　　We had passed through many of the places along the ten-day march several times. The masses in the villages and towns welcomed us as enthusiastically as they had sent us off to fight before. Gongs and drums filled the air, and they shouted: "Welcome the People's Liberation Army to Shanyin to build water conservancy," "Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's production instructions," "Complete the production tasks for 1950." The streets were filled with boiled water, and some even had eggs, cigarettes, and dried apricots. The villagers stopped the ambulance, and would not let it pass unless they ate something. Students, staff, and government workers at the Xiahuayuan Station also welcomed us by dancing the production dance and twisting the Yangko.
　　Along the way, the unit's recreational activities were particularly active. From cadres to soldiers, from leading organs to companies, from the place of departure to the campsite, there were always songs. Everyone also sang the fast clappers, ditties, and big pieces they had composed themselves... The comrades forgot their fatigue and were all so excited and happy.
　　The comrades' eagerness to participate in production was so great: when camping in Zhuolu, it was only eight li from the home of soldier Meng Chunhui. The instructor had repeatedly suggested that he go back to see his family. But his answer was always: "Seeing my family is a small matter, production is a big matter. It won't be too late to see them when we come back after completing the canal digging task."
　　The unit's mass discipline was better than before. The comrades' slogans and actions were: "Three No Gos" – no leaving without cleaning up; no leaving without returning borrowed items or compensating for damaged items; no leaving without propaganda and apology. When camping in Zhuolu, the comrades stopped to carry water and sprinkle the streets, and clean the courtyards, doing propaganda work. Some of the masses came out to dissuade them: "Aren't you tired after a day's work?" Many comrades were sick, some had blisters on their feet, but they still insisted on marching. Along the way, the entire division did not mobilize a single civilian worker or animal. When the masses learned of the unit's production news, everyone was very moved. An old man said: "Our People's Liberation Army is so good, they conquered the world and now they are building the world."
　　In order to consolidate the learning achievements of the past six months, the comrades insisted on military, political, and cultural studies along the way, regardless of fatigue. A certain regiment's Second Battalion practiced measuring distances (estimating and pace counting) while marching on the Pingchuan land; they practiced identifying terrain features when walking in the mountains. All units discussed issues such as "Why are we participating in production" while walking. Cultural studies were never interrupted. The A class of the literacy class learned two characters per person per day; the B class learned one character. The cultural classes were able to keep writing diaries and wall newspaper articles. The Seventh Company of a certain regiment prepared forty literacy cards in advance, wrote new characters on them, and hung them on the carrying poles during the march. The comrades recited them while walking.
　　On April 8th, we successfully reached our destination. Now, we are busy tidying up the houses, washing clothes, inspecting and repairing tools, adjusting mutual aid groups, signing mutual aid contracts and production plans, and organizing canal digging demonstrations, etc.
　　On the 13th, we will begin the canal digging work in a vigorous manner.

　　生产进军路上
　　何可人　柯尔
    华北解放军某部决定到山阴县挖渠，参加国家水利建设。出发之前，同志们脑子里盘旋着：“坐火车呢？还是行军？”
    仔细盘算之后，作出了决定：“不坐火车”。
    六百里长途，步行需要十天。如果首先坐火车到大同，可以少走七、八天路。可是同志们想到：整个部队坐火车，要用五十多万斤小米的车费，而且对国家的运输工作也有影响。我们去参加生产，原是增加国家财富，减轻人民负担，首先就为人民省下这笔车费罢。战士谢根海说得好：“我们是人民的子弟兵，应处处为人民着想。要坐火车，就不如发扬我们的光荣传统，走着去，将这一笔款拿去救济灾民。”
    十天行军路过的地方，有好多是我们走过几次的。各个村镇欢迎我们的群众，还是像以前欢送我们去打仗一样热情。锣鼓喧天，高喊着：“欢迎解放军到山阴兴修水利”，“坚决执行毛主席的生产指示”，“完成一九五○年的生产任务”。街头上摆满了开水，有的还摆着鸡蛋、纸烟和杏干。老乡们拦住病号车，不吃就不让过去。下花园车站的学生、职工和政府工作人员，还跳着生产舞，扭着秧歌欢迎我们。
    一路上，部队的文娱工作特别活跃。从干部到战士，从领导机关到连队，从出发地到宿营地，总是歌声不断。大家还歌唱着自己编的快板、顺口流、大洋片……同志们忘记了疲劳，都是那样地兴奋、愉快。
    同志们参加生产的心情是那样迫切：在涿鹿宿营时，离战士孟春惠的家只有八里地。指导员曾数次提出让他回去看看。但他的回答始终是：“看家是小事，生产是大事，等完成挖渠任务回来时再看也不晚”。
    部队的群众纪律，比以前更好了。同志们的口号和事实就是这样：“三不走”——不打扫清洁不走；借物不送还、损物不赔不走；不宣传、不道歉不走。在涿鹿宿营时，同志们停下来就担水泼街，打扫院子，作宣传工作。有的群众出来阻劝：“你们辛苦了一天还不休息？”许多同志生了病，有的脚上打起了泡，还坚持行军。一路上，全师没有动员一个民工或一头牲口。当群众知道部队去生产的消息后，大家都很感动，一位老汉说：“咱们解放军真好，打了天下又建设天下。”
    为了巩固半年来的学习成绩。同志们不顾劳累，一路上坚持军事、政治、文化的学习。某团二营在平川地行军就练习测量距离（目测和步测）；走到山地就练习识别地形地物。部队各单位都一边走，一边讨论着“我们为什么参加生产”等问题。文化学习更一直没间断，识字班的甲班每人每天学两个字；乙班学一个字。文化班都能坚持写日记和墙报稿子。某团七连事先作好了四十块识字牌，写上生字，行军中挂在担子上。同志们一边走，一边念。
    四月八日，我们胜利地达到了目的地。现在，正忙着整理房屋，洗衣服，检查和修理工具，调剂互助组，订互助合同和生产计划，组织挖渠示范等等。
    十三日，我们即将轰轰烈烈地开始挖渠工作。
