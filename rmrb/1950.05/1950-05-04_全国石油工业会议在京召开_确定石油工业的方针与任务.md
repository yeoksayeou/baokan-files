Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The guidelines and tasks of China's petroleum industry have been decided by the National Petroleum Industry Conference convened by the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government in Beijing from April 13th to 24th. The conference decided that the main guideline for China's petroleum industry is to restore the existing foundation within three years, utilize the effectiveness of existing equipment, increase production, and carry out exploration and construction work in a planned and focused manner to meet the needs of national defense, transportation, and industry. According to this guideline, the conference believes that it is necessary to strengthen unified leadership and use existing engineering cadres and equipment and materials in a planned manner, implement democratic reform, learn advanced technology, and implement an enterprise-based quota management system in order to achieve the goals of good quality, large quantity, low cost, and high efficiency.

The conference decided to focus on vigorously developing petroleum resources in the Northwest and quickly restoring the artificial petroleum industry in the Northeast. The restoration work in the Northeast will focus on Fushun, followed by Jinzhou, and then Jinxi and Siping plants, while strengthening technical conditions and cultivating and allocating technical cadres. The conference believes that in order to strengthen exploration in the Northwest and quickly restore the artificial petroleum industry in the Northeast, a large number of outstanding cadres should be transferred to these two regions in a planned manner to meet the requirements of the overall task of the national petroleum industry. The conference also decided to massively cultivate and train petroleum industry cadres.

In his summary of the National Petroleum Industry Conference, Minister Chen Yu of the Ministry of Fuel Industry particularly pointed out that China's natural and artificial petroleum resources are abundant and widely distributed, but under the current conditions of national financial difficulties, we can only do our best to restore the original foundation and carry out exploration and construction in a focused and step-by-step manner. Such a guideline is realistic and extremely prudent, otherwise it will be in vain and difficult to properly coordinate with the restoration and development of the entire industry. Minister Chen called on everyone to learn from the Soviet Union to expand operations with economical methods and gradually develop China's petroleum industry.

　　全国石油工业会议在京召开
    确定石油工业的方针与任务
    【新华社三日讯】新中国石油工业的方针与任务，已由中央人民政府燃料工业部于四月十三日至二十四日在京召开的全国石油工业会议作出决定。会议决定：中国石油工业的方针主要是在三年内恢复已有基础，发挥现有设备效能，提高产量，有步骤有重点地进行探勘与建设工作，以适应国防、交通与工业的需要。根据这一方针，会议认为必须加强统一领导和有计划地使用现有工程干部与各项设备器材，贯彻民主改革，学习先进技术，实施企业化的定额管理制度，以达到质好、量多、成本低与效率高的目标。
    会议决定以大力开发西北石油资源、尽速恢复东北人造石油工业为重点。东北的恢复工作则着重抚顺，其次锦州，再次锦西、四平等厂，并加强技术条件，培养与配备技术干部。会议认为，为了加强西北探勘和尽速恢复东北人造石油工业，应有计划地向该两地调送大批优秀干部，以适应全国石油工业总任务的要求。会议还决定大量培养和训练石油工业干部。
    燃料工业部陈郁部长在全国石油工业会议的总结中特别指出：中国的天然石油与人造石油的资源是丰富而且分散很广的，但在目前国家财政困难条件下，只能尽力恢复原有基础，有重点有步骤的进行探勘与建设。这样的方针是实事求是的，也是极为稳重的，否则就会落空，就难以适当配合整个工业的恢复与发展。陈部长号召大家学习苏联以节约的方法扩大经营，逐步发展我国的石油工业。
