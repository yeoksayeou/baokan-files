Xinhua News Agency, 24th: Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government and Chairman of the Chinese People's Relief Association, Soong Ching-ling, issued a statement today as follows:

　　I have noticed that in recent broadcasts, "Voice of America" has fabricated slanderous remarks attacking the relief policies of the People's Republic of China. The slander stated: I had sent a telegram to a group friendly to the Chinese people, namely the China Welfare Appeal, requesting the transportation of grain and supplies to China. I dare say this is a shameful lie used to distort the meaning of a certain paragraph in Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's May Day report. First, I have never sent a telegram to the China Welfare Appeal asking for grain. Second, Vice Chairman Liu has made it very clear in his May Day report that the People's Republic of China is always prepared to accept well-intentioned foreign aid, but we do not need to accept anything harboring imperialist intentions.

　　It is well known that I, Vice Chairman Liu, and the Chinese People's Relief Association are wholeheartedly united, and we resolutely and unswervingly reject any so-called "help" used to undermine or indirectly attack the People's Government. As has been stated in other documents published to the world, I would also like to state here that the Central People's Government is fully capable of overcoming any natural disasters, and this is in fact the current situation in our country.

　　Those American imperialist elements who waste their time worrying about the welfare of the Chinese people would be better off spending more time on the welfare issues of their own country. These welfare issues include the living problems of more than sixteen million people in their country today, who are either partially unemployed or completely unemployed. The Chinese people would also like to suggest that these hypocritical philanthropists spend less time shouting about war at the London Conference, and instead use all this wasted energy to save the phenomenon that their industrial index has dropped by more than 20 percent. This decline in the industrial index will seriously affect the welfare of the American people.

　　宋副主席发表谈话
    痛斥“美国之音”谎言
    我政府完全能够克服任何灾荒  决不接受蓄有侵略意图的东西
    【新华社二十四日讯】中央人民政府副主席及中国人民救济总会主席宋庆龄本日发表谈话如次：
    我注意到“美国之音”在最近的广播中，曾制造谰言攻击中华人民共和国的救济政策。谰言说：我曾给一个对中国人民友好的团体即中国福利呼吁会打电报要求运送粮食物资来华。我敢断言这乃是用以歪曲刘少奇副主席五一报告中某一段落的意义的可耻的谎言。第一、我从来就没有打电报给中国福利呼吁会要粮食。第二、刘副主席已在五一报告中说得十分明白，中华人民共和国常是准备接受善意的国外援助的，但我们却不需要接受任何畜有帝国主义意图的东西。
    人所共知，我和刘副主席以及中国人民救济总会是衷心一致的，我们对于任何用以破坏或间接地打击人民政府的所谓“帮助”坚决地毫不动摇地予以拒绝。恰如曾在向全世界发表的其他文件中所说明的一样，在此我还想声明：中央人民政府是完全能够克服任何灾荒的，并且这就是目前我们国内的实际的情况。
    那些把时间浪费在忧虑中国人民的福利的美国帝国主义分子们，最好还是在他们本国的福利问题上多花费些时间吧。这些福利问题，包括今天他们国内一千六百万以上人民的生活问题，他们或是部分失业，或是完全失业。中国人民还愿意建议这些虚伪的慈善家们少在伦敦会议上花费时间叫嚣战争，而把这所有浪费的精力转用来挽救他们的工业指数已降低百分之二十以上的现象。这一工业指数之降低将极严重地影响美国人民的福利。
