　　Wu Zhengxiang, Party Branch Secretary of Kangzhuang Village, Huolu
　　Investigated by the Court for Embezzling Public Funds

　　Wu Zhengxiang, Party Branch Secretary (and also Squad Leader) of Kangzhuang Village, Second District, Huolu, has been expelled from the Party for embezzlement and has been handed over to the People's Court for legal action. Wu Zhengxiang joined the Party in 1949. Last year, he and five households including Cheng Daming and Cheng Decai farmed land on behalf of military dependent Wu Yufang (contract farming). Nominally, they farmed eight mu on her behalf, but in reality, they only farmed 1.8 mu, calculating 40 work points per mu, embezzling the labor for 6.2 mu of land (228.5 work points), equivalent to 920 jin of rice. He used this rice to buy more than one mu of land. The military dependent's 6.2 mu of land was either half cultivated by others because no one farmed it (his own land was farmed by others, with the harvest split in half). Later, under pressure from the masses, he compensated the military dependent with 6 dou of corn. At the same time, to reduce his own responsibility, he fabricated false accounts, claiming that the work points and rice were divided among the five households, and a false account of giving the military dependent 300 jin of wheat. He also used the name of the squad to withdraw 825 jin of victory harvest wheat from the finance and grain committee. Apart from buying four quilts for the squad and using 5 dou for heating, the rest was all used by the militia squad and some cadres for eating and drinking. He bought each quilt for the discounted price of 2.5 dou of wheat, but the actual price was not that high, indicating embezzlement. In addition, during the autumn harvest last autumn, the militia squad caught several thieves and fined them over 300 jin of rice. Under his leadership, 16 members of the village squad, the branch propaganda officer Wu Dacheng, the Youth League branch secretary Wu Luanjin, and 18 others each bought a pair of shoes and a towel, and the rest was all used for eating and drinking. Furthermore, he was involved in arresting and releasing gamblers. According to the masses, he gambled many times, losing 100,000 yuan in one instance (he only admitted to one time). He also bullied people based on his power, pledging empty codes, and entrusted the war service committee member to sell the captured mahjong tiles, obtaining 30,000 yuan. When selling, others dared not buy, and he said, "I guarantee you won't be arrested for gambling within a month."

　　Due to his various mistakes, the people were very dissatisfied with him, and the reflections were very bad. District Secretary Li Taosuo, Organization Officer Kang Sibang, Youth Committee Secretary Guo Qiufu, and others did not seriously resolve this matter, which further fueled his bad work style. In April, the county committee sent Comrade Feng Zhengmin, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department, to conduct a detailed investigation and clarify the facts. To uphold Party discipline, it was decided to expel Wu Zhengxiang from the Party. The government also ordered him to return the embezzled grain and funds and hand him over to the People's Court for investigation. The others were to apologize publicly and admit their mistakes.

　　获鹿康庄村支部书记仵正祥
　　贪污公款被法院查办
    获鹿二区康庄村支部书记（兼中队长）仵正祥因贪污已被开除党籍，并已送人民法院法办。仵正祥系一九四九年入党，去年他与程大名、程德才等五户给军属仵玉芳代耕（包耕），名义上代耕八亩，实际上只代耕一亩八分，每亩以四十个工计算，贪污六亩二分地的工（二百二十八个半工），计折米九百二十斤。他用此米买了一亩多地。该军属的六亩二分地因无人耕种而半种给别人（自己的地让别人耕种收获对半分）。后来他在群众的逼迫下给军属补了六斗玉茭。同时他为减轻自己的责任，捏造假账说是五户伙分了工米，及给过军属三百斤麦子的假账。他还用中队部的名义从财粮委员手中支出胜利果实麦子八百二十五斤，除中队部买被子四张，及生火用去五斗之外，其余全由民兵小队及一部干部吃酒吃肉用了。他买被子每张折价麦二斗半，实际价格并没有这样高，其中也有贪污。另外在去秋秋收时民兵小队捉到小偷数人，罚米三百余斤。在他的领导下村小队十六人及支部宣传干事仵大成，青年团支书仵乱金等十八人每人买鞋一双，毛巾一条，其余也全是吃酒吃肉用光了。此外他还抓赌放赌。据群众反映，他赌过许多次，有一次即输了十万元（他只承认一次）。他并仗势欺人，押空码；并且将抓来的麻将牌托战勤委员给他出卖，得洋三万元。卖时别人不敢要，他说：“保证一个月内不抓你的赌。”
    由于他的种种错误，使老百姓对他很不满，反映很坏。区书李套锁，组织干事康四棒，青委书记郭秋福等，对这事都未认真的加以解决，因此更助长了他的坏作风。县委会于四月间派宣传部副部长封正民同志，前往详细调查，弄清了事实。为维护党纪，决定开除仵正祥党籍。政府并令其退出贪污粮款，并送人民法庭查办。其余则当众道歉，承认错误。
