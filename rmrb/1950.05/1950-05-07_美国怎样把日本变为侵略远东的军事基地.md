The Japan under the occupation of US imperialism is being transformed into a major military base in the US's Pacific aggression line, stretching from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the Philippines in the south.

The US occupation authorities in Japan, headed by MacArthur, have been deliberately undermining the solemn provisions of the Potsdam Declaration on the demilitarization of Japan from the outset, preserving Japan's wartime military bases and military potential, and making Japan a major base and assistant for US imperialism's aggressive adventures in the Far East. For several years, the US occupation authorities have been continuously carrying out projects to repair and expand existing bases and build new ones. Since early February this year, after the US Chiefs of Staff "inspected" Japan and conferred with MacArthur, the US's actions to turn Japan into a permanent military base have become even more blatant.

Taking naval bases as an example, the United States has not only completely preserved Japan's original important naval bases such as Yokosuka, Sasebo, and Kure, but also continuously expanded these naval bases and added new US technical equipment. According to a report in the American magazine *Newsweek* at the end of 1948: "The former Japanese naval base in Yokosuka is now the best-equipped headquarters of the US Navy in the Orient. It has three large floating docks, six smaller floating docks, and twenty cranes. Under this restoration, Yokosuka can amply accommodate two aircraft carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, and sixteen destroyers. In an emergency, the size of this naval base can be quickly expanded several times." The US Navy has also opened a naval air base for naval aircraft in Oppama, within the Yokosuka naval base area, which began operations on March 10 this year. The Oppama base has two aircraft hangars, several factories, and several barracks. According to an Associated Press report on March 11 this year, it is "one of the few similar bases in the Western Pacific." In addition, the Karita port (in northern Kyushu), a base newly opened during the war, is now being constructed by the United States with a large-scale water system, ready to be used as a US naval base.

As for air force bases, American journalist David Conde reported as early as 1947: "Throughout Japan, there are still airfields and military buildings everywhere... From Kyushu to Hokkaido, air-raid shelters, underground factories, and command posts left over from the war can be seen everywhere." A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on June 2, 1948, stated: "The original Japanese airfields on the islands of Kyushu, Honshu, and Hokkaido have now been greatly expanded. An airfield capable of accommodating the largest bombers still under design by the United States is also being built at the northern end of Honshu." According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on June 18, 1948, citing the French Communist Party's weekly *Action*: "Representatives of MacArthur's headquarters have signed contracts with two Japanese construction companies to build US air force bases in Miyagi Prefecture in northeastern Honshu, the Izumi area of Kagoshima in southern Kyushu, the Akita Prefecture in northern Honshu, and the Sapporo area of Hokkaido. In addition to building new air force bases, other US airfields in Japan are also being expanded and rebuilt."

One of the largest new air force bases built by the United States in Japan is the Misawa Airfield at the northern end of Honshu mentioned in the Reuters dispatch, with a runway of 9,500 feet, of which 8,500 feet are paved with reinforced concrete. According to the March issue of *U.S. News & World Report* this year: "Misawa Air Force Base has been completely rebuilt. The main US air force base in southern Japan is Itazuke in Kyushu. All of these bases have runways for the largest bombers." The United States is still continuing to build new air force bases in Japan. The US Eighth Army in Japan publicly announced in early April this year that the US military had recently built a new airfield in the Negishi seaside area of Isogo Ward, Yokohama City, and had begun using it on April 3.

At the same time, in the periphery of Japan, the United States has occupied a large amount of arable land in the Ryukyu Islands under its occupation and is actively carrying out the construction of permanent military bases. US Undersecretary of the Army Voorhees bluntly declared in early March this year that the US military had decided to "station troops in the Ryukyu Islands indefinitely and begin a large-scale military construction plan." The US Congress had already allocated 70 million US dollars last year for the construction of permanent military bases in Okinawa Island, the main island of the Ryukyu Islands, which are resistant to typhoons. According to the *Millard's Review* in January this year: "The United States has nine airfields on Okinawa Island," and a Reuters dispatch on January 14 stated: "The main air force base on Okinawa Island has built runways for B-36 bombers."

Japan is also being turned into an arsenal for the United States to slaughter the people of the Far East. Military factories originally included in the reparations list have been repeatedly removed by the United States, retained, and expanded to become part of the US "Far East arsenal." Brigadier General Nieburg, Chief of Ordnance of the US Far East Command, publicly broadcast on July 18 last year that the US "occupation forces are using Japanese factories and manpower to store war materials." "Thousands of reconditioned vehicles have been produced under our production policy, including jeeps, armored vehicles, and tanks." The US government is now ordering a large amount of military equipment to support Japan's war industry. Mitsubishi will manufacture the largest caliber long-range artillery, anti-tank guns, and various types of light weapons for the United States; the company's shipyards have begun repairing 86 warships belonging to the former Japanese Navy, which will be handed over to the "Maritime Safety Agency," a disguised Japanese naval ministry, in the short term. Japan Explosives Company has received orders to manufacture gunpowder, explosives, mines, and chemicals. Ishikawajima Company has received large orders for the manufacture of light and heavy tanks and armored vehicles. In northern Kyushu, the Yawata Works of Japan Steel Corporation (Japan's largest steel plant) has received an order for 100,000 tons of steel to be shipped to Okinawa Island.

These new weapons, designed by the US government and manufactured under the supervision of US officers, will arm the new Japanese army organized around the so-called "police force" and supply the armies of US vassal states in Southeast Asia.

The US imperialists' aggressive actions of turning Japan into a military base have been opposed by the people of various countries in the Far East, especially the Japanese people who bear the brunt. Under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, various Japanese democratic organizations are launching a broad peace movement, demanding the early conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty and opposing turning Japan into a US military base.

### 美国怎样把日本变为侵略远东的军事基地

　　美国怎样把日本变为侵略远东的军事基地
    美国帝国主义者占领下的日本，正在被变作美国的北起阿留申群岛南迄菲律宾的太平洋侵略线中的主要军事基地。
    以麦克阿瑟为首的美国驻日占领军当局，自始就蓄意破坏波茨坦宣言中关于日本非军事化的庄严规定，保留日本战时的军事基地和军事潜力，使日本成为美帝国主义在远东进行侵略冒险的主要根据地和助手。几年以来，美国占领军当局不断进行修建扩大原基地，和建筑新基地的工程。自今年二月初，美国四参谋长“巡视”日本，与麦克阿瑟会商后，美国把日本变为永久性军事基地的行动，是更加明目张胆了。
    以海军基地来说，美国不仅完整地保留了日本原有的重要海军基地横须贺、佐世保和吴港等，并且对这些海军基地不断加以扩充，增添了美国的新式技术装备。据一九四八年底美国《新闻周刊》报道：“前日本在横须贺的海军基地，现在是美国海军在东方装备最好的总司令部。该地现有大活动船坞三个，较小活动船坞六个，起重机二十架。在这种恢复情况下，横须贺已能充裕地容纳航空母舰二艘，战舰二艘，巡洋舰四艘及驱逐舰十六艘。在紧急情况下，这一海军基地的规模，能迅速扩大数倍。”美国海军并在横须贺海军基地区内的追滨，开辟了一个海军飞机用的空军基地，于今年三月十日开始使用。追滨基地设有二个飞行机仓、若干工场和几个兵营。据美联社今年三月十一日电称：它是美国在“西太平洋少有的几个相同的基地中的一个”。此外，在战时新辟的基地刈田港（在九州北部），现在正由美国进行建设大规模的水道系统，准备作为美国的海军基地。
    再就空军基地来说，美国记者大卫·康德早在一九四七年就已报道：“在日本境内，现在到处还有飞机场和军事建筑存在……从九州到北海道，随处可见战时留下的防空洞、地下工厂和司令部。”一九四八年六月二日路透社东京电称：“现在九州、本州及北海道诸岛，日本原有的飞机场均已大事扩充。本州北端还正在建筑可以容纳美国尚在设计中的最巨型轰炸机的机场。”据塔斯社巴黎一九四八年六月十八日电引法国共产党出版的《行动》周刊消息称：“麦克阿瑟总部的代表已与两家日本建筑公司签订合同，兴建在本州东北部宫城县、九州南部鹿儿岛的出水地方、本州北部秋田县诸地区及北海道的札幌地区的美国空军基地。除建筑新空军基地之外，其他美国在日本的飞机场也正在扩大与重建中。”
    美国在日本新建的最大的空军基地之一，就是路透社电所述本州北端的三泽飞机场，跑道全长达九千五百英尺，其中有八千五百英尺系用钢骨水泥铺成。据今年三月《美国新闻与世界报道》周刊称：“三泽空军基地已全部改造完毕。美国在日本南部的主要空军基地是九州的板付。所有这些基地都有供最大轰炸机使用的跑道。”美国现在还在日本继续建筑新空军基地。美国驻日占领军第八军在今年四月初公开宣布：美军最近在横滨市矶子区根岸海滨地方建筑了一个新飞机场，并已自四月三日起开始使用。
    同时，在日本外围，美国在其占领下的琉球群岛，霸占了大量的耕地，积极进行永久性的军事基地建设。美国陆军部副部长伍里斯今年三月初直言不讳地宣称：美军已决定“无限期在琉球群岛驻扎，并开始实行大规模军事建设计划”。美国国会去年即已拨款七千万美元，以供在琉球群岛的主岛——冲绳岛建设不怕台风的永久性军事基地。据今年一月的《密勒氏评论报》载称：“美国在冲绳岛设有九个飞机场”，路透社一月十四日电称：“冲绳岛的主要空军基地，建筑了可供Ｂ——３６型轰炸机的跑道”。
    日本也正在被变作美国屠杀远东人民的兵工厂。原被列入赔偿清单的军需工厂，一再被美国剔除，加以保留，并且扩大，成为美国“远东兵工厂”的构成部分。美国远东司令部军械处处长尼布格准将在去年七月十八日公开广播称：美国“占领军正利用日本的工厂与人力，储存战争物资。”“数以千计的重修后的车辆已在我们的生产方针下生产出来，其中包括吉普车、铁甲车和坦克等。”美国政府现在正为扶植日本战争工业而定购大量军事装备。三菱公司将为美国制造最大口径的长射程大炮、反坦克炮及各种类型的轻武器；该公司的船坞且已开始修理属于前日本海军的八十六艘军舰，以便在短期内交给变相的日本海军省的“海上保安厅”使用。日本火药公司已收到制造火药、炸药、地雷及化学品的定单。石川岛公司收到了制造轻重坦克及装甲车的大批定单。在九州北部，日本钢铁公司八幡工厂（日本最大的钢铁厂）已收到运往冲绳岛的十万吨钢料的定单。
    这些由美国政府设计，并在美国军官监督之下制造的新武器，将武装以所谓“警察队”为核心而组织的新日本陆军，并供应东南亚美附庸国的军队。
    美国帝国主义者变日本为军事基地的侵略行动，遭到远东各国人民的反对，特别是首当其冲的日本人民的反对。在日本共产党的领导下，日本各民主组织，正在发动广泛的和平运动，要求早日缔结全面和约，反对变日本为美国的军事基地。
