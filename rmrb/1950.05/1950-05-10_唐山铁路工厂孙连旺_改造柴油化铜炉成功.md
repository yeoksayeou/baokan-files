Tangshan Railway Factory's Sun Lianwang
Successfully Modified Diesel Copper Furnace

[This dispatch] Tangshan Railway Factory foundry worker Sun Lianwang successfully modified a diesel copper furnace and was awarded the factory's first-class prize. Before the modification, the furnace could melt three furnaces of copper per day, totaling 1,400 kilograms. After the modification, it can melt six furnaces of copper per day, totaling 1,800 kilograms. Before the modification, each jin (approximately 0.5 kg) of oil could melt 7 kilograms of copper; now it can melt 12 kilograms of copper. This saves 48,700 yuan in diesel fuel per day. Based on 312 working days per year, it can save over 136.6 million yuan annually. After the modification, the number of pinholes in the castings from the furnace is reduced, and the quality is improved. The railway factory has awarded Sun Lianwang a special prize of 100 work points (equivalent to 276,800 yuan in People's Currency), recorded a major merit, and awarded a banner of glory.

The diesel copper furnace is a horizontal gourd-shaped type, with two oval furnace chambers at both ends, and a flue eye at the pointed center. Both furnaces load materials simultaneously and melt them in turn. However, due to the large furnace chambers, deep furnace bottom, and small flue eye, the firepower was insufficient, the melting temperature was inconsistent, and the copper water was not clean. Sun Lianwang suggested raising the furnace bottom by 3.5 inches to reduce the capacity (formerly 500 kilograms per furnace, now 300 kilograms per furnace), and enlarging the flue eye from 2 inches to 4 inches, and making it eccentric, which is more convenient for pouring copper water. His suggestion was approved for trial, and the results were good. (Yao Fu)

　　唐山铁路工厂孙连旺
    改造柴油化铜炉成功
    【本报讯】唐山铁路工厂铸工孙连旺，改造柴油化铜炉成功，荣获该厂一等奖励。该炉改造前，每天可化铜三炉，计一千四百公斤。改造后每天化铜六炉，计一千八百公斤，改造前每斤油化铜七公斤，现可化铜十二公斤，每天可节省柴油合四万八千七百元，每年以三一二天计算，可节省一亿三千六百余万元；改造后出炉铸件砂眼减少，质量提高。铁路工厂已发给孙连旺特等奖一百工分（折人民券二十七万六千八百元），记大功一次，并奖光荣旗一面。
    柴油化铜炉是卧式亚葫芦型，两端为两个椭圆形炉囊，当中尖端处为过火眼，两炉同时装料，轮流熔化。但因炉囊大，炉底深，过火眼小，致火力不足，熔化温度不一，铜水不清。孙连旺建议将炉底垫高三寸半，使容量减少（过去每炉五○○公斤，现在每炉三○○公斤），过火眼由二英寸加大到四英寸，并改为偏心，倒铜水时更加便利。他的建议经批准试行，效果良好。（药夫）
