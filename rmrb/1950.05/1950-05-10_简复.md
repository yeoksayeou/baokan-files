　　To Comrades Yu Min, Zhang Yun, Zhang Yaozong, and others:
　　The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has provided a comprehensive reply to your questions regarding the Beijing Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School, as follows:
　　(1) Students of the Beijing Experimental Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School are recommended for entrance examination by central and Beijing municipal level organizations. Cadres from other regions who meet the requirements may request their respective departments to recommend them for entrance examination to the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary Schools in those regions.
　　(2) All students in the current term of the Beijing Experimental Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School were recommended for entrance examination; there were no self-applicants.
　　(3) In addition to Beijing, Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary Schools have been established in North China (Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan) and the major administrative regions of Northeast, East China, Central South, and Northwest China. A large number are also planned to be established within the armed forces.
　　(4) Admission requirements for Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary Schools: Any government, Party committee, and people's organization staff members (or industrial workers with three or more years of work experience) on the supply system who have participated in the revolutionary struggle for three or more years, are between the ages of sixteen and thirty, have a cultural level equivalent to that of a senior primary school graduate, are ideologically progressive, work actively, and are in good health, may be recommended by the personnel department of their organization and admitted after passing the school's entrance examination.
