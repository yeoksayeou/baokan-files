　　Dear friends!
    The Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace fully agrees with the work report of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Advocates for Peace, approves of the activities of the Standing Committee since the World Congress of Advocates for Peace, and deeply appreciates the diligent and selfless work of the Standing Committee and its Chairman, Professor Joliot-Curie.
    Since the adjournment of the World Congress of Advocates for Peace in April 1949, the movement of people of all nationalities around the world to strive for peace has achieved great success. The number of peace fighters all over the globe is constantly increasing. National peace movements are being carried out in various countries.
    On October 2nd, International Peace Day, the day after the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was proclaimed, the Chinese Conference for the Defense of World Peace was held. The conference lasted for two days, and was attended by 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in China, who truly represented the broad masses of the Chinese people. Also participating in the conference were a delegation of Soviet cultural workers headed by Fadeyev, a delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and representatives of the Italian people. The entire 475 million people of China unanimously and strongly wish to peacefully build their own independent, democratic new country and their own culture. The Chinese people need to build and restore production destroyed by the war, so the need for peace is very urgent. The Chinese people wish to live in peace and friendship with the people of all countries in the world. The Chinese people are willing to defend their country and nation to avoid being subjected to imperialist aggression again. (This aggression has caused the Chinese people great suffering in the past 100 years, and the Chinese people have continuously fought against foreign aggression for more than 100 years.) At the same time, the Chinese people are willing to work together with all the people on earth to defend world peace. The Chinese people firmly support all the programs of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Advocates for Peace.
    The Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference states: "The People's Republic of China unites with all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and people in the world, especially with the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries and all oppressed nations, stands on the side of the international peace and democracy camp, and jointly opposes imperialist aggression to ensure lasting world peace." Article 54 of the Common Program also stipulates: "The principle of the People's Republic of China's foreign policy is to safeguard the independence, freedom, and territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country, to uphold lasting international peace and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, and to oppose the imperialist policy of aggression and war."
    Mass rallies and demonstrations were held throughout China on International Peace Day. (300,000 people in Beijing, 500,000 people in Tianjin, and 1 million people in Shanghai) Oppose aggressive war and support world peace; at the same time, celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government with Mao Zedong as its chairman—this is the greatest event in human history since the Russian October Revolution, and it is of great significance for defending lasting peace and universal security in the Far East and the world.
    The Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionary group in China colludes with American imperialism, hoping to launch a third world war in order to preserve itself and avoid destruction.
    American imperialism uses Chiang Kai-shek as its running dog in an attempt to turn China into a strategic base for its enslavement of the Far East and the world.
    The Chinese people's annihilation of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime is a heavy blow to American imperialism and other warmongers, and it is a guarantee of peace in the Far East and the world.
    A series of international conferences were held in China—after the National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in October, the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference was held in November, and the Asian Women's Conference was held in December. These conferences fully demonstrated the determination of the working people and women of Asia and Australia to fight for peace.
    Today, it is particularly worthy to report to the meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Advocates for Peace and peace-loving people all over the world that we have achieved a great achievement in the struggle for world peace—that is, the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance Between China and the Soviet Union was signed a month ago!
    This is a fraternal alliance treaty of friendship and mutual assistance, a treaty that can only be signed between socialist countries and new democratic countries.
    This is the only truly equal and mutually beneficial treaty that China has signed with foreign countries in a century (except for the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance in 1945).
    This is a treaty to guarantee peace in the Far East and even the world.
    The great Soviet Union has long been the leader of the world peace camp. The Soviet Union has always been the fortress and pillar of world peace.
    Now, as everyone knows, "The Chinese, who account for a quarter of all mankind, have stood up!" (Mao Zedong). The Chinese people have also made China a fortress in the Far East to resist aggression, oppose war threats and guarantee peace.
    The close unity of the nearly 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union against aggression is undoubtedly a great strengthening of the world peace camp and a great strengthening of the fighting force of the world peace movement.
    This unity, this power, makes peace-loving people rejoice and makes war instigators tremble!
    Here we would like to further explain that the movement to support world peace cannot be separated from the people's movement to fight for democracy and the movement to fight for national independence in various countries.
    China is a clear example. If the Chinese people do not overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary autocratic regime that launched a large-scale war in China and tried to incite a third world war, and do not expel the American imperialists who supported Chiang Kai-shek's attack on the Chinese people with force, how can there be peace? How can we guarantee peace in China and the Far East?
    The Chinese people believe that they should morally support the national independence movements of the people of Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaya, and South Korea. The attacks by imperialist aggressor troops in these places are the seeds that may lead to a large-scale war. Imperialist countries should be required to stop their attacks and withdraw their aggressive troops.
    If imperialism does not have the support of colonial manpower and material resources, it cannot launch and support a major war. Therefore, in order to consolidate world peace, we must oppose colonial policies.
    We demand that French troops withdraw from Vietnam. The political system of Vietnam should be chosen by the Vietnamese people themselves.
    We demand that Dutch troops withdraw from Indonesia. The fate of Indonesia should be decided by the Indonesian people.
    Let the people of South Korea decide their own destiny! We oppose the attempt by American imperialists and their running dog Syngman Rhee to turn South Korea into a strategic base for American imperialism.
    Let the Japanese people decide their own fate! We demand that a peace treaty with Japan be concluded as soon as possible. American troops get out of Japan!
    We resolutely oppose the American imperialists' rearming of the Japanese warlords and using them as tools for the US imperialist policy of aggression and expansion and using Japan as a strategic base for war in the Far East.
    We oppose the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Line" advocated by the American imperialists, and oppose the Pacific Group that the American imperialists are planning to organize to provoke new wars.
    Severely protest to the American imperialists who bombed major cities in China with American planes! American planes, American shells, and American and Japanese pilots cruelly and brutally killed Chinese women, children, and old people! This last-ditch struggle by the American imperialists and their running dogs has no effect on themselves.
    Oppose germ warfare! We resolutely demand the trial of germ warfare criminals!
    We sympathize with the Greek people's movement for liberation. The fate of all nations should be decided by the nations themselves. We firmly support the struggle of all nations for independence.
    Dear friends, peace fighters!
    The strength of the struggle for lasting world peace has increased and become stronger. The founding of the People's Republic of China and the founding of the German Democratic Republic... are all powerful factors in strengthening the fortress of peace. The ranks of those who support peace all over the world already include half of all mankind.
    However, the danger of war still exists.
    The instigators of aggressive war, headed by American imperialism, are doing their best to prepare for a new massacre all over the world. In addition to what has been said above, let's take China as an example.
    Regardless of their complete political and military bankruptcy, the Kuomintang reactionary group is still doing its best to delay the criminal war to oppose the People's Republic of China.
    Everyone knows that American imperialists are playing a huge role in organizing this meaningless resistance of the Kuomintang. American imperialism shamelessly continues to interfere in China.
    After the Kuomintang remnants were driven out of mainland China, they retreated to a few small islands and continued to obtain various war materials from the American imperialists. Truman and Acheson made many false statements. But the Kuomintang bandits continued to obtain tanks, planes, gasoline, bombs, weapons and other war materials from the United States. Kuomintang warships obtained American coal, shells, and parts.
    The Americans built many airports in Taiwan and other places. Hundreds of American advisors continue to direct the military operations of the Kuomintang army, helping the Kuomintang army to reorganize and replenish. In order to strengthen the Kuomintang army, MacArthur sent thousands of Japanese military experts from Japan to Taiwan, and they should be tried as war criminals.
    If the Kuomintang military forces could not hold the small islands such as Taiwan, the American imperialists planned to occupy these islands with American troops.
    We must take action to oppose aggressive war, oppose warmongers, and support world peace. We admire and praise the heroic actions of workers in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium... who refused to transport war materials. Salute to the working class!
    Strengthen our peace movement. Strengthen the power of the World Congress of Advocates for Peace. Strengthen the ties between the Standing Committee and the National Committees for the Defense of Peace. Strengthen the organization and propaganda of the National Congresses for the Defense of Peace. Expose the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers. Sincerely tell the people of America and Europe: as long as you become aware, organize, strive for democracy and freedom, and resist war threats, the big bellies on Wall Street will not be able to fight a major war. We are not begging the warmongers for peace, but we must have the power to stop their war provocations!
    Unite in the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, unite under the banner of the great teacher of mankind and the great peace fighter Stalin, and fight to eliminate the war crisis and strive for lasting peace!

### 在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议上的发言

　　在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议上的发言
　　萧三亲爱的朋友们！
    中国保卫世界和平大会委员会完全同意世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的工作报告，赞同从世界拥护和平大会以来常委会的活动，并且深深地感激常设委员会及其主席约里奥——居里教授的辛勤忘我的工作。
    从一九四九年四月世界拥护和平大会闭会以来，世界各族人民争取和平的运动，已获得了很大的成就。全地球各地和平斗士的数目正在不断地增加。全国性的和平运动正在各国开展。
    在中华人民共和国中央人民政府宣告成立的第二天，十月二日——国际和平日，中国保卫世界和平大会开了会。大会开了两天，参加大会的有一千名中国各阶层的代表，他们真正代表广大的中国人民群众。参加大会工作的还有以法捷耶夫为首的苏联文化工作者代表团、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团、和意大利人民的代表。中国四万万七千五百万人民全体一致强烈地愿望和平地建立自己独立的民主的新国家和自己的文化。中国人民要建设，要恢复被战争破坏的生产，因此需要和平是很迫切的。中国人民愿望和世界各族人民和平地、友好地相处。中国人民愿意保卫自己的国家和民族，使之避免再度遭受帝国主义的侵略。（这种侵略在最近一百余年以来曾经使得中国人民备受痛苦，这百余年来中国人民曾不断地进行了反对外来侵略的斗争。）中国人民同时愿意和地球上一切人民在一道，来保卫世界和平。中国人民坚决拥护世界拥护和平大会常委会的一切纲领。
    中国人民政治协商会议所通过的共同纲领说：“中华人民共和国联合世界上一切爱好和平、自由的国家和人民，首先是联合苏联、各人民民主国家和各被压迫民族，站在国际和平民主阵营方面，共同反对帝国主义侵略，以保障世界的持久和平”。共同纲领第五十四条又规定：“中华人民共和国外交政策的原则，为保障本国独立、自由和领土主权的完整，拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策”。
    中国全国各地在国际和平日都举行了群众的大会和示威游行。（北京三十万人，天津五十万人，上海一百万人）反对侵略战争，拥护世界和平；同时庆祝中华人民共和国及以毛泽东为主席的中央人民政府的成立——这一个自从俄国十月革命以来人类历史上最伟大的事件，对于保卫远东乃至世界的持久和平与普遍安全，是有绝大的意义的。
    中国的蒋介石国民党反动集团和美国帝国主义勾结，指望掀起第三次世界大战，以求保存自己，免于灭亡。
    美帝国主义利用蒋介石作他的走狗，企图变中国为战略基地，作为他奴役远东以及全世界的张本。
    中国人民消灭蒋介石反动政权，就是给美帝国主义及其他战争贩子以沉重的打击，就是使远东乃至世界和平得到保障。
    在中国举行了的一连串的国际会议——十月中苏友好协会全国代表大会之后，十一月开了亚澳工会代表会议，十二月开了亚洲妇女代表会议。这些会议都充分地表示了亚澳劳动人民和妇女为争取和平而斗争的决心。
    今天特别值得向世界拥护和平大会常委会会议及全世界爱好和平的人士报告的，是我们在争取世界和平斗争中获得了一项伟大的成就，——那就是一个月以前签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约！
    这是一个兄弟同盟友好互助的条约，只有社会主义的国家和新民主主义的国家才能够签订的条约。
    这是中国百年以来和外国（除一九四五年中苏友好同盟条约外）订立条约中真正平等互助的条约。
    这是一个保障远东乃至世界和平的条约。
    伟大的苏联很久以来就是世界和平阵营的领袖。苏联一贯是世界和平的堡垒和支柱。
    现在，如众所周知，“占全人类四分之一的中国人站立起来了！”（毛泽东）。中国人民也已经使中国变为在远东抵抗侵略、反对战争威吓与保障和平的堡垒了。
    中苏两个大国将近七万万的人民亲密地团结起来，反对侵略，这无疑地是世界和平阵营大大的加强，是世界和平运动斗争力量的大大加强。
    这一团结，这一力量，使得爱好和平的人们欢欣鼓舞，使得战争挑拨者发抖！
    在这里我们愿意再加以说明的是：拥护世界和平运动，是不能与各国人民争取民主运动及争取民族独立运动分割的。
    中国就是一个显明的例子。假如中国人民不打倒在中国发动大规模战争并力图煽起第三次世界大战的蒋介石反动专制政权，不驱逐以武力支持蒋介石进攻中国人民的美帝国主义，怎能有和平呢？怎能保障中国以及远东的和平呢？
    中国人民认为应当在道义上支持越南、印尼、马来亚、南朝鲜等人民的民族独立运动。帝国主义侵略军队在这些地方的进攻，是可能酿成大规模战争的火种。应当要求帝国主义国家停止进攻，并撤退他们的侵略军队。
    帝国主义假如没有殖民地人力物力的支持，是不能掀起和支持大战的。因此为了巩固世界和平，应当反对殖民地政策。
    我们要求法军退出越南。越南的政治制度由越南人民自己选择。
    我们要求荷军退出印尼。印尼的命运由印尼人民自己决定。
    让南朝鲜人民决定自己的命运吧！我们反对美帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚变南朝鲜为美帝国主义战略基地的企图。
    让日本人民自己决定日本的命运吧！我们要求赶快订立对日和约。美军从日本滚出去！
    我们坚决反对美帝国主义者重新武装日本军阀，利用他们作为美帝侵略扩张政策的工具和利用日本作为远东战争的战略基地。
    我们反对美帝国主义所倡导的什么“东南亚防线”，反对美帝国主义正在计划要组织的挑拨新战争的太平洋集团。
    向用美机轰炸中国各大城市的美帝国主义者严厉地抗议！美国飞机，美国炮弹，美国和日本飞行员残忍地惨杀中国的妇女、儿童、和老人！美帝国主义者及其走狗这种最后的拼命挣扎，对于他们自己是没有任何效果的。
    反对细菌战！我们坚决要求审判细菌战犯！
    我们同情希腊人民争取解放的运动。各族人民的命运由各族人民自己来决定。我们坚决支持各族人民争取独立的斗争。
    亲爱的朋友们，和平斗士们！
    争取世界持久和平的力量是增加了，强大起来了。中华人民共和国的成立，德意志民主共和国的成立，……都是增强和平堡垒有力的因素。全世界拥护和平的队伍已经有全人类的一半了。
    但是，战争的危险仍然存在。
    以美帝国主义为首的侵略战争挑拨者在全世界各地极力准备新的大屠杀。除上面所说的而外，举中国为例吧。
    不管政治上和军事上完全破产，但国民党反动集团仍极力拖延罪恶的战争以反对中华人民共和国。
    谁都知道，组织国民党这种无意义的抵抗，美帝国主义者起着绝大的作用。美帝国主义无耻地继续干涉中国。
    国民党残余被驱逐出中国大陆后，退到几个小岛上，继续从美帝国主义者那里取得各种战争物资。杜鲁门和艾奇逊作了许多虚伪的声明。但国民党匪帮继续从美国取得坦克、飞机、汽油、炸弹、武器和其他战争物资。国民党的兵船取得美国的煤、炮弹、零件。
    美国人在台湾等地修了许多飞机场。几百个美国顾问继续指挥国民党军队的军事行动，帮助国民党军队改组，补充。为了加强国民党军队，麦克阿瑟从日本派了几千个日本军事专家到台湾去，而他们是应该作为战犯来审判的。
    假如国民党军事力量不能保住台湾等小岛，美帝国主义者曾打算用美国的军队占领这些岛屿。
    我们要以行动来反对侵略战争，反对战争贩子，拥护世界和平。我们钦佩、赞美法、意、荷、比……工人拒运战争物资的英勇行为。向工人阶级致敬！
    加强我们的和平运动。加强世界拥护和平大会的力量。加强常设委员会与各国保卫和平委员会的联系。加强各国保卫和平大会的组织与宣传。揭露帝国主义战争贩子的阴谋。诚恳地告诉美国和欧洲的人民：只要你们自己觉悟、组织起来，争取民主自由，反抗战争威吓，华尔街的大腹贾们就打不起大战来。我们不是向战争贩子哀求和平，而是要有力量制止他们的战争挑拨！
    团结在以苏联为首的世界和平阵营里，团结在伟大的人类导师与伟大和平战士斯大林的旗帜之下，为消灭战争危机与争取持久和平而战斗吧！
