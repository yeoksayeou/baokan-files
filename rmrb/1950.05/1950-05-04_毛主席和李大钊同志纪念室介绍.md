Introduction to the Commemorative Room of Chairman Mao and Comrade Li Dazhao
    Beijing University Correspondence Group
    The commemorative room for Chairman Mao and revolutionary martyr Comrade Li Dazhao was commissioned by the Beijing "May Fourth" Commemoration Preparatory Committee to be arranged by Peking University. The commemorative room is located on the first floor of the Red Building of Peking University in Sand Beach. The interior furnishings are arranged as much as possible to resemble the original state when Chairman Mao and Comrade Li Dazhao worked at the school. Wang Xiying and Li Xuzu, two old staff members from the "May Fourth" era, drew the plans and helped with the arrangement. It has now been completed and is scheduled to open at 9:00 AM on "May Fourth."
    The commemorative room is divided into inner and outer rooms. The outer room is a reception room, and the inner room is a studio. Guo Moruo's inscription hangs at the entrance. To the right is "Chairman Mao's Workplace at the School," and to the left is the Li Dazhao Memorial Hall. Comrade Li Dazhao's desk is placed by the window in the office; his books are displayed in the glass cabinet on the left. On the right table are Comrade Li Dazhao's articles published in magazines such as New Youth. Hanging on the wall are various sized photographs of Comrade Li Dazhao, as well as his archives and calligraphy from his time at Peking University. Some of these precious historical materials were found in the Peking University Library, while others were privately collected. From these simple displays, we can imagine Comrade Li Dazhao's work in this room in those years. In the center of the reception room is a long table, inlaid with Chairman Mao's inscription: "Congratulations on the 31st anniversary of the 'May Fourth' Movement, unite and strive for the construction of a New China." Many young students and professors once sat at this table. Comrade Li Dazhao united revolutionary youth in this room and established a Marxist research group, which often held meetings here. According to Mr. Wang Xiying, Chairman Mao often came here and sat at the long table by the window. There is also a glass cabinet on the left side against the wall, containing magazines from the "May Fourth" era—New Youth, New Tide, etc. Chairman Mao's works are placed on the two glass-paneled tables. The most striking object in the room is Chairman Mao's spirited half-length plaster statue, which was made and donated by Professor Sun Bo of the Peking University School of Engineering.
    Except for the two glass cabinets, the furniture in these two rooms is no longer the old items, but rather reproductions sought out according to the original appearance. Mr. Wang Xiying still remembers the scene of more than 30 years ago very vividly. Recalling Comrade Li Dazhao's work here at the time, he said: "Mr. Li was really good, responsible, and diligent. He sat here all day long, eating only two steamed buns and pickled tofu he brought himself for lunch; he was very kind to us staff." His words portray the arduous and simple style of a great communist, further increasing our respect for this leading figure of the "May Fourth" Movement.

　　毛主席和李大钊同志纪念室介绍
    北京大学通讯组
    毛主席和革命先烈李大钊同志的纪念室，是由北京纪念“五四”筹委会委托北京大学布置的。纪念室在沙滩北京大学红楼一楼，室内一切陈设尽量按照毛主席和李大钊同志在该校工作时的原样陈设。由“五四”时代的老职员王锡英和李续祖两人绘图和帮助布置。现在已布置完竣，定“五四”上午九时揭幕。
    纪念室共分内外两间，外屋是会客室，里屋是工作室。门口挂着郭沫若的题字。右边是“毛主席在校工作处”，左边是李大钊纪念堂。办公室靠窗放着李大钊同志的办公桌；左边玻璃柜里陈列着他的书籍。右边桌上是李大钊同志在新青年等刊物上发表的文章。墙口挂着李大钊同志的大小像片和他在北大时的档案、墨迹等。这些珍贵的纪念史料，有的是从北大图书馆找来的，有的是私人收存的。由这一些简单的陈列里，我们可以想见李大钊同志当年在这间屋子工作的情形。会客室正中是一条长方台子，上面镶着毛主席的题字：“祝贺‘五四’三十一周年，团结起来为建设新中国而奋斗。”当年在这张桌前曾经坐过不少青年学生及教授，李大钊同志就是在这间屋子里团结着革命青年，成立了马克思主义研究小组，经常在这里开会。靠窗是一个长桌，据王锡英先生说：毛主席常来这里，就是坐在这张桌旁的。左边靠墙也有一个玻璃柜，里面是“五四”时代的杂志——新青年、新潮等。两个玻璃格的桌子上放着毛主席的著作。室内最惹人注目的是毛主席的神采奕奕的半身石膏像，这是北大工学院教授孙伯先生制赠的。
    这两间房子里面的家具，除了两个玻璃柜之外，其他都已不是旧物，只是仿照原样搜求来的。王锡英先生对这三十多年前的情景还记得很鲜明。他回忆着李大钊同志当时在这里工作的情形说：“李先生可真好，工作负责，勤劳，一天到晚坐在这里，中午就吃两个馒头和自己带来的酱豆腐；他对我们职员非常和蔼。”他的话刻划出一个伟大的共产主义者艰苦、朴实的作风，更增加了我们对这位“五四”领导人物的崇敬。
