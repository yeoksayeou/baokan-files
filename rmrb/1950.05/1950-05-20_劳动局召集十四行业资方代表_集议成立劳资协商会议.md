　　Labor Bureau Convenes Representatives of Fourteen Industries
　　Discussing and Establishing Labor-Management Consultation Meetings
　　[Beijing Municipal News Agency] The Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau continues to call on labor and management in private enterprises to establish consultation meetings and work together to overcome the temporary difficulties in the improving economy. After convening representative meetings of labor representatives from twelve industries, it convened a meeting on the 18th at the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, attended by more than two hundred and forty representatives of capital from fourteen industries in Beijing, including hardware, electrical materials, copper, iron, and tin, automotive materials, textiles, silk, department stores, money shops, new medicines, tea, vegetable markets, restaurants, hotels, and bathhouses. At the meeting, Ma Guangdou, Deputy Director of the Labor Bureau, gave a speech entitled "How Labor and Management in Private Enterprises Can Work Together to Overcome Temporary Difficulties and How to Establish Consultation Meetings." He first analyzed the reasons for the temporary difficulties in industry and commerce and the role of labor-management consultation in overcoming the current difficulties. He pointed out that some capitalists, in order to reduce costs, simply propose to reduce wages or dismiss workers. This view is incorrect, because the main way to solve the current production and business difficulties is for capitalists to adopt a truly democratic style, rely on and give full play to the production enthusiasm of workers through labor-management consultation, and jointly find ways to improve business methods and rectify operations, in order to reduce costs and improve quality and credit. For some industries that are not needed by the people and that have long relied on rising prices for speculation, the current problem is how to plan to change industries and invest funds and personnel in legitimate operations. Then, Deputy Director Ma gave practical examples of labor and management in many factories and shops in Beijing working together to overcome temporary difficulties, such as the private Housheng Match Factory, Jingwei Weaving Factory, and Xinhua Rubber Factory. Because workers practiced thrift, increased production, and capitalists adopted workers' suggestions for "small profits but quick turnover," business and production have improved. He said: This proves that the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings has become the main key for labor and management in private enterprises to work together to overcome temporary difficulties, because today labor and management are in the position of friends, and the contradictions between labor and management are mainly resolved through consultation. Both sides must conduct reasoned struggle based on policies and laws under the principle of equality and mutual benefit. This struggle is for unity and for the development of production. The labor-management consultation meeting is an institution for equal consultation between labor and management, and is not responsible for enterprise operation and administrative management. It helps capitalists to better operate and manage on the basis of the new labor-management relationship, rather than interfering with or restricting the operation and management of capitalists. Therefore, it is different in nature from the management committees of public factories.
    Finally, Deputy Director Ma pointed out how labor and management should hold good consultation meetings: Preparations must be made before the meeting. Both parties should first put forward the proposals and exchange them with each other's representatives so that they can fully study them before the meeting.

　　劳动局召集十四行业资方代表
　  集议成立劳资协商会议
    【京市新闻处讯】京市劳动局继续号召私营企业劳资双方成立协商会议，并协力克服经济好转中的暂时困难。在召开了十二个行业的劳方代表大会后，又于十八日召集京市五金、电料、铜铁锡、汽车材料、布业、绸缎、百货、钱庄、新药、茶叶、菜行、饭食、旅店、浴堂等十四个行业的资方代表二百四十余人在市工商联合会举行大会。会中，劳动局马光斗副局长以“私营企业劳资双方如何协力克服暂时困难以及如何成立协商会议”为题讲话，他首先分析了工商业暂时困难的原因及通过劳资协商对克服目前困难所起的作用。他指出：有些资方为了要降低成本，只是单纯地提出减低工资或解雇工人，这种看法是不正确的，因为解决目前生产和业务上的困难，主要的还要靠资方采取真正的民主作风，通过劳资协商来依靠并发挥工人的生产积极性，共同设法改善经营方法，整顿业务，以降低成本，提高质量和信用。对于有些不为人民所需要的以及过去长期依靠物价上涨投机倒把的行业，目前的问题则是怎样有计划的去转业，将资金和人员投向正当经营。接着，马副局长并举出京市许多厂号劳资协力克服暂时困难的实际例子，如私营厚生火柴厂，经纬织布厂，及新华橡胶厂等，由于工人厉行节约，提高产量及资方采纳工人“薄利多销”的建议等，结果营业、生产都趋向好转。他说：由此证明：劳资协商会议的设立，就成为目前私营企业中劳资协力共同渡过暂时困难的主要关键，因为今天劳资双方是处在朋友的地位，劳资之间的矛盾主要用协商的方式来解决，双方都要根据政策法令在平等两利的原则下，进行说理斗争，这种斗争是为团结，为了发展生产。劳资协商会议是劳资双方平等协商的机构，不负企业经营与行政管理的责任，它是帮助资方在新的劳资关系的基础上更好的经营管理，而不是干涉限制资方的经营管理，因此，它与公营工厂管理委员会的性质是不同的。
    最后，马副局长对劳资双方怎样开好协商会议，指出：会前必须作好准备工作，双方先把议案提出，交由自己的代表与对方互相交换，以便彼此在会前充分研究。
