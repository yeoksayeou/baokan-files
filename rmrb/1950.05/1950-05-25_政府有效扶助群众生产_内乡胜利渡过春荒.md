　　Government Effectively Helps the Masses in Production
    Neixiang Successfully Overcomes the Spring Famine
    [Report from this newspaper, Neixiang] Neixiang County, Henan Province, has successfully overcome the spring famine and completed spring plowing and planting. The county has suffered from spring famines for years, and last year it suffered from disasters such as bandits, insects, floods, and droughts, resulting in widespread crop failures. The transition from spring to summer was difficult, and the disaster situation became even more serious. According to surveys in February and March, approximately 10,000 households and 50,000 people throughout the county were short of food for one to two months.

    In order to help farmers produce and overcome the famine, the government focused on distributing loans in kind, such as oil and salt, equivalent to 486,284 jin of miscellaneous grains, solving the production funding difficulties of 352 handicraft households and 62 transportation groups. The county's public-private cooperative used 628,462 jin of miscellaneous grains to purchase 7,500 bolts of native cloth, 6,824 jin of tung oil, and 4,742 jin of medicinal materials. This promoted the exchange of goods, opened up sales channels for local products, and solved most of the difficulties faced by farmers in overcoming the famine. In order to ensure that "no one starves to death," the People's Government issued 184,291 jin of emergency relief grain three times, providing relief to 28,482 people. In addition, 33,000 jin of grain were distributed for work relief and transportation costs, which could solve the livelihood of 1,000 people for 33 days.

    In addition to effective relief and assistance, the government actively publicized and led the masses to engage in self-salvation through production, overcoming the mentality of waiting for relief among the masses, and proposed slogans such as "Run around a bit, and you'll be full" and "As long as people are diligent, they don't have to worry about starving." First, a large number of early-maturing vegetables were planted and substitutes for food were collected. According to incomplete statistics, the county planted more than 10,000 mu of vegetables, overcoming the difficulties of the spring famine. In terms of collecting food substitutes, the statistics for Chimei District in March alone reached 410,000 jin, equivalent to more than 200 shi of grain. The masses reflected, "We can get through this spring just by eating vegetables." At the same time, various districts adopted different production methods. For example, Xia Guan, Chimei, and Mashan districts, which are close to mountainous areas, organized production activities such as digging for vegetables, collecting firewood, panning for iron ore, and transportation. According to statistics from five townships, including Xiezhai in Chimei District, 147 groups collected firewood, totaling more than 490,000 jin. At 50 yuan per jin, this could be sold for more than 20 million yuan, equivalent to more than 60,000 jin of grain. At one jin per person per day, this could solve the livelihood of more than 1,000 people for two months. In terms of handicrafts, workshops, oil mills, flour mills, and other side businesses such as bamboo weaving and straw sandal making have also developed greatly. For example, in Yangji and Yanwan townships in Yangji District, there are 320 flour mills, which can not only maintain the livelihood of the whole family, but also raise livestock. In addition, the masses also demonstrated the spirit of "farmers all over the world are one family" by practicing mutual aid, mutual lending, and mutual relief. In the three districts of Shigang, Chimei, and Xia Guan alone, 18,342 jin of grain were lent to each other, solving the production difficulties of 336 households and 1,367 people.

    Because the difficulties in the production and life of the masses were solved, and the government's production policy was vigorously publicized, the farmers' production enthusiasm was stabilized and stimulated. At the same time, attention was paid to not missing the farming season during the land reform, and the masses generally actively carried out spring plowing and planting, and weeded the wheat fields two to three times. In addition to spring plowing, farmers also reclaimed wasteland on the edges of villages. According to incomplete statistics from the three districts of Chimei, Zuo'an, and Yangji, more than 1,480 mu of wasteland were reclaimed. Three townships in Xia Guan District reclaimed more than 9,870 workdays of land, which is estimated to increase grain production by 236 shi (500 jin per shi). In order to solve the farmers' difficulties in agricultural tools during the spring plowing season, the government focused on distributing agricultural loans of 129,389 jin of grain. Farmers bought a total of 306 cattle, purchased 585 pieces of agricultural tools, and more than 4,400 jin of fertilizer and oil cakes, solving some of the farmers' financial difficulties in spring plowing. At present, the county's early-maturing crops are gradually being harvested, and the difficulties of the spring famine have been basically overcome.

　　政府有效扶助群众生产
    内乡胜利渡过春荒
    【本报内乡讯】河南内乡县已胜利渡过春荒，并已完成春耕春种。该县连年闹春荒，去年又遭受匪、虫、水、旱等灾害，以致普遍歉收，春季青黄不接，灾情更形严重。据二、三月份的调查，全县约有一万户、五万人缺一至二个月的食粮。
    政府为了扶助农民生产渡荒，前后有重点的发放了油、盐等实物贷款，折合杂粮四十八万六千二百八十四斤，解决了三百五十二户手工业者和六十二个运输组的生产资金困难。县公营供销合作社以六十二万八千四百六十二斤杂粮收买土布七千五百匹，桐油六千八百二十四斤，药材四千七百四十二斤。促进了物资交流，打开了土产品的销路，解决了农民渡荒的大部困难。为了保证作到“不饿死一个人”，人民政府曾三次发下急赈救济粮十八万四千二百九十一斤，救济了二万八千四百八十二人。另外，发放以工代赈及运费粮等三万三千斤，可解决一千人三十三天的生活。
    除了有效的救济与扶助外，主动的宣传与领导群众生产自救，克服群众中存在的等待救济的思想，提出“跑一跑、饱一饱”，“只要人手勤，不怕饿着人”的口号。首先大量种植早熟菜蔬及收集代食品。据不完全统计，全县种菜即达万亩以上，渡过春荒，已无困难。在收集代食品方面，仅以赤眉区三月份的统计，即达四十一万斤，可抵粮二百余石。群众反映说：“今春光吃菜，也能渡过。”同时，各区采取了不同的生产方式。如夏馆、赤眉、马山等区靠近山地，组织挖菜、打柴、淘铁沙、运输等生产。仅以赤眉区谢砦等五个乡的统计：打柴的一百四十七个组，共打柴四十九万多斤，每斤以五十元计算，可卖两千多万元，折合粮食六万多斤，每人每日以一斤计，可解决一千多人两个月的生活。在手工业方面，作坊、油坊、粉房等及其他编竹器、打草鞋等副业，也大有发展。如杨集区的杨集、阎湾两个乡，共有粉坊三百二十家，除能维持全家生活外，还可养家畜。另外群众又发挥了“天下农民是一家”的精神，实行互助、互借、互济，仅以师岗、赤眉、夏馆等三个区，互借粮一万八千三百四十二斤，解决了三百三十六户、一千三百六十七人的生产困难。
    由于解决了群众生产、生活中的困难，并大力宜传了政府生产方针，安定与激发了农民的生产情绪。同时在土地改革中注意了不误农时，群众普遍积极进行春耕下种、把麦田锄了二至三遍。除春耕外，农民在村边荒地上实行开垦，据赤眉、岞?、杨集三个区不完全的统计，开荒一千四百八十多亩。夏馆区三个乡开荒九千八百七十多个工，估计能增产粮食二百三十六石（每石五百斤）。为了在春耕时期解决农民的农具困难，政府曾有重点发放农贷粮十二万九千三百八十九斤，农民共买牛三百零六头，置农具五百八十五件，肥料、油饼四千四百多斤，解决了农民春耕中部分资金困难。目前该县早熟作物渐可收获，基本上克服了春荒困难。
