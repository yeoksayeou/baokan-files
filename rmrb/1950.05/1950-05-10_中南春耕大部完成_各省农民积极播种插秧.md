Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 8th: The spring plowing work in various provinces of Central and South China has been largely completed, and farmers are now engaged in sowing and transplanting rice. The spring plowing work in various parts of Central and South China began extensively around the Qingming Festival. In Henan Province, in the northern part of the region, most of the spring land has been plowed, and the wheat fields have also been hoed. Farmers in various counties are now applying fertilizer and sowing cotton, sorghum, millet and other crops. In the seven counties of Jiaxian, Baofeng, and others where land reform has been completed, most of the early autumn land has also been cultivated. In Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces, most of the paddy fields have been plowed for the first time and early rice seedlings are being transplanted. Among them, the transplanting of rice seedlings is nearing completion in various counties in southwestern Jiangxi and central Guangdong.

This year's spring plowing production in the provinces of Central and South China is being carried out under the active leadership and assistance of the People's Government. The Central and South China Military and Political Committee issued instructions calling on government agencies and people's organizations at all levels to take the leadership of spring plowing as the overriding central task in rural work. The People's Governments of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces also issued spring plowing mobilization orders and strengthened specific leadership over spring plowing production. Local People's Governments have universally convened people's representative conferences and farmer representative conferences to publicize the People's Government's policies of rewarding increased agricultural production, dispel farmers' concerns, and stabilize the existing rural production relations. At the same time, local People's Governments actively assisted farmers in solving various difficulties in spring plowing production. According to statistics from the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, under the leadership of the People's Government, farmers reduced rent and recovered a total of 600 million catties of grain from landlords, enabling farmers who lacked grain and seeds to carry out spring plowing production smoothly. The People's Governments of various provinces also issued more than 50 million catties of agricultural loans and a large amount of relief grain, helping farmers solve the difficulties of lacking cattle and seeds. In addition, the People's Government organized farmers to help each other, which also solved many difficulties for farmers in spring plowing production. All organs, troops, and schools in Central and South China helped local farmers and families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and working cadres with spring plowing, with an average of at least one day of voluntary work per person. The People's Government also organized farmers to exchange labor and help each other according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and promoted women to go to the fields for production. These measures have considerably solved the difficulty of insufficient labor for farmers in spring plowing production.

　　中南春耕大部完成
    各省农民积极播种插秧
    【新华社汉口八日电】中南区各省春耕工作已大部完成，农民们正在进行播种、插秧。中南区各地的春耕工作自清明前后即普遍展开，该区北部的河南省，春地已大部耕完，麦地亦已锄完，各县农民正在进行施肥和播种棉花、高粱、谷子等作物。郏县、宝丰等土地改革已经完成的七个县，早秋地亦已大部耕种完毕。湖北、湖南、江西、广东、广西五个省大部稻田都已经耕完头遍，开始插早稻秧。其中赣西南和粤中各县，插秧并已接近完成。
    中南各省今年的春耕生产，是在人民政府的积极领导和帮助之下进行的。中南军政委员会曾发出指示，号召各级政府机关和人民团体，将领导春耕作为农村工作中压倒一切的中心任务，湘鄂赣三省人民政府也发布了春耕动员令，并加强对春耕生产的具体领导。各地人民政府曾普遍召开了各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议，宣传人民政府奖励农业增产的政策，解除农民顾虑，稳定现存的农村生产关系。同时，各地人民政府并积极协助农民解决春耕生产中的各项困难。据豫鄂湘赣四省统计，在人民政府领导下，农民向地主减租收回租粮共达六亿斤，使缺粮缺种的农民得以顺利进行春耕生产。各省人民政府并发放了五千余万斤农业贷粮和大批救济粮，帮助农民解决了缺牛、缺种的困难。此外，人民政府还组织农民互助互济，也解决了农民进行春耕生产中的不少困难。中南区所有的机关部队学校，都就近帮助当地农民和革命烈士、军人、工作干部家属春耕，平均每人最少帮助了义务工作一天。人民政府又根据自愿两利的原则，按照原有习惯组织农民变工互助；并提倡妇女下地生产。这些办法相当地解决了农民在春耕生产中劳动力不足的困难。
