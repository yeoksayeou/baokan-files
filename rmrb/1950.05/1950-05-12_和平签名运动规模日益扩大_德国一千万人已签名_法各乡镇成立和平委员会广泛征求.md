Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 10th: The German Peace Committee recently issued a communique reporting on the progress of the signature campaign in the German Democratic Republic for the Stockholm Appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. The communique stated that approximately ten million people in the German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Mecklenburg have already signed the appeal.

Furthermore, in West Germany, despite the unbridled propaganda against the signature campaign by reactionary elements, the peace signature campaign is successfully progressing among people of all strata. In Nuremberg alone, more than 45,000 people had signed by May Day. Not only young people participated in the signature campaign, but also the elderly actively participated. For example, Mrs. Menges, a 70-year-old woman from Neckarstadt, collected 300 signatures. Intellectuals also enthusiastically support the signature campaign. Dr. Hübner, a renowned physicist and expert in atomic energy, stated when signing that every German scientist must unconditionally support the banning of atomic weapons and sign the appeal.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 11th: The campaign in France to collect signatures for the World Peace Congress Standing Committee's appeal to ban atomic weapons is expanding daily.

As of the 4th, over 100,000 people in Marseille alone had signed the appeal.

Workers and staff at the Renault automobile factory have already signed 23,100 copies of the bulletin containing the full text of the Stockholm Conference appeal.

The National Committee of the United Progressive Christians has decided to urge all Catholics and Protestants in France to sign the appeal and participate in the signature collection campaign.

The Standing Committee of the French Women's Union has recommended that its affiliated committees collect 500,000 signatures for the appeal before May 30th, which will be the first stage of the French Women's Union's guaranteed campaign to collect five million signatures.

To promote the signature collection campaign, many township committees and peace committees of the "Association of Fighters for Freedom and Peace" have been established throughout France. For example, the twenty new township committees established in the departments of Creuse and Landes have decided to regard active participation in the signature collection campaign for the Stockholm Conference appeal as their supreme task. Six new township committees have been established in the Hérault department.

On May 4th, the General Confederation of Labor called on all trade union organizations in France to redouble their efforts to collect millions of signatures for the appeal in enterprises across the country.
