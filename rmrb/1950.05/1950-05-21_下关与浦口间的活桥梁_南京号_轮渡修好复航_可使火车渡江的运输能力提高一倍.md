　　The Living Bridge Between Xiaguan and Pukou
    "Nanjing" Ferry Repaired and Returned to Service
    Can Increase Train Ferrying Capacity by One Fold
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] The "Nanjing" ferry, which carries trains across the Yangtze River between Xiaguan and Pukou in Nanjing, has been repaired and returned to service on the Xiaguan section of the river on the 11th. The return of the "Nanjing" will increase the train ferry capacity between Xiaguan and Pukou in Nanjing by more than one fold. Last year, when our army crossed the river, the bandits frantically seized the "Nanjing," attempting to send it to Taiwan. Near Shanghai, our army intercepted them, and the bandits set the vessel on fire with gasoline, sinking it to the bottom of the Huangpu River. After the liberation of Shanghai, the Shanghai Railway Bureau, in coordination with the Navigation Bureau, salvaged the vessel. On December 16th of last year, it surfaced, and workers from the Shanghai Metalworkers' Trade Union Production Cooperative Factory undertook the repairs. Disregarding enemy aircraft bombings and overcoming material shortages, the workers of the factory heroically raced against the clock for 73 days to repair the "Nanjing," the living bridge that had been riddled with holes by the bandits, presenting it in a brand-new form on the Xiaguan section of the river.

　　下关与浦口间的活桥梁
    “南京号”轮渡修好复航   
    可使火车渡江的运输能力提高一倍
    【新华社十九日讯】南京下关与浦口间载运火车渡江的“南京号”轮渡，已经修复于十一日在下关江面复航。“南京号”复航后可使南京下关与浦口间火车渡江的运输能力提高一倍以上。去年我军渡江作战时，匪帮仓皇把“南京号”掳走，企图送往台湾，至上海附近为我军截住去路，匪帮竟将该轮用汽油纵火焚烧，沉于黄浦江底。上海解放后，经上海铁路局协同航务局进行打捞。去年十二月十六日浮出江面后，由上海五金工会生产合作工厂工人包修。该厂工人们不顾匪机轰炸并克服了材料的困难，经过七十三天的英勇抢修，终于使被匪帮破坏得千疮百孔的活桥梁——“南京号”以崭新的姿态出现在下关江面。
