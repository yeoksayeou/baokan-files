　　It is Wrong to Equally Distribute Houses in the City
　　To the Editor:
　　On January 22nd, the People's Daily published a reply to the Pingyuan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs regarding questions about urban real estate and housing on September 9, 1949, stating: "The situation of landlords' houses in cities is very complicated, and generally they cannot be considered feudal property. Therefore, houses in cities, whether owned by urban landlords or rural landlords, should not be confiscated at present."
　　However, in Qinyang County, Pingyuan Province, during the land reform, several houses belonging to a widowed old woman, Tian Ma, who lived in Tao Hutong in the city were also distributed. I think this is unreasonable. Do the comrades in charge of land reform work in Qinyang County also know this? I request that you inquire with relevant authorities on how to correct this and publish the response.

　　Editor's Note: Comrade Ding Hongci's opinion is correct. We hope that the county government will quickly handle this matter and inform us of the results.

### 平分城市中的房子是错误的

　　平分城市中的房子是错误的编辑同志：
    一月二十二日，人民日报上曾登有答复平原省民政厅在一九四九年九月九日，所问关于城市地产房屋的问答，说：“地主在城市中的房屋，情形十分复杂，一般地不能认为是封建财产。因此，城市中的房屋，无论是属于城市地主，或乡村地主所有，现在都不得没收。”
    可是，平原省沁阳县在土改中却把住在城里陶胡同一位孤寡老太太田马氏敷余的几间房子也分配出去了。我觉得这是不合理的事情。负责沁阳县土改工作的同志们是不是也知道这一点。祈代为询问有关机关如何纠正请予刊示。
