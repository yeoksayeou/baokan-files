Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 14th: The secretary of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, Hall, and the national organization secretary, Winston, issued a statement denouncing the American reactionary government's imprisonment of Dennis as an act of preparing for war. The statement said: "The imprisonment of Communist General Secretary Dennis should deeply concern, hope, and frighten every American... Dennis was singled out for persecution and imprisonment because, as the leader of the Communist Party, he dared to resist the Cold War conspiracy that would plunge our country into atomic slaughter. He refused to hand over the legacy of the American people's political freedom to a group of self-appointed Congressional stormtroopers. Dennis refused the unreasonable interrogation of Congressman Thomas (currently in prison for embezzling government funds). People will understand that the conspiracy to frame Dennis in 1950 has a longer-term and more sinister purpose. The world knows painfully that the arrest of a Communist leader signifies the progress of fascist reaction and atomic war. Dennis is the first victim of a Hitler-like threat. This threat endangers our country. If the entire working class and all Black people who are similarly attacked do not resist the forces that drove Dennis into prison, then Dennis will not be the last victim. Therefore, we call on all American compatriots to take joint action to defend their rapidly disappearing legacy of political freedom. We ask them to join an irresistible people's march to rescue Dennis from the hands of war-makers and labor-haters."

Note: Dennis was sentenced by the New York Federal Court on March 19, 1947, to one year in prison and a fine of one thousand dollars for the so-called crime of "contempt of Congress." Subsequently, Dennis appealed against this unreasonable verdict, but the US Supreme Court surprisingly voted to uphold the original verdict of the Federal Court on March 27 this year. According to an Associated Press report on the 12th, the US authorities have ordered the immediate imprisonment of Dennis to execute the original sentence.

　　反对美帝希特勒式的威胁
　　温斯顿呼吁援救但尼斯
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社纽约十四日讯：美国共产党全国委员会书记霍尔与全国组织书记温斯顿发表声明，痛斥美国反动政府监禁但尼斯是准备战争的行动。声明说：“共产党总书记但尼斯被监禁，每个美国人都该觉得这件事深深地引起他内心的关怀、希望和恐惧………但尼斯被选出来加以迫害和监禁，是因为作为共产党的领袖，他敢于反抗势将把我们国家推进原子屠杀中的冷战阴谋。他拒绝把美国人民政治自由的遗产交给一群自命自封的国会突击队。但尼斯拒绝了议员汤麦斯（因盗用政府公款现正在狱中）的无理询问。人们会了解，在一九五○年诬陷但尼斯的阴谋，有更长远的罪恶目的。全世界痛苦地知道了共产党领袖的被捕，是意味着法西斯反动势力和原子战争的进展。但尼斯是第一个希特勒式威胁的受难者。这种威胁使我们国家陷于危境。如果同样遭受攻击的全体工人阶级、全体黑人不去反抗那些把但尼斯逼到狱中的势力，那么但尼斯将不会是最后一个受难者。因此，我们号召一切美国同胞共同行动，保卫他们的正在迅速消失的政治自由遗产。我们要求他们加入不可抗拒的人民进军，把但尼斯由战争制造者和憎恨劳工的人的手掌中营救出来。
    按：但尼斯于一九四七年三月十九日被纽约联邦法院以所谓“蔑视国会”罪，判处一年徒刑与一千美元罚金。其后但尼斯对这无理判决提起上诉，但美国最高法院竟于今年三月二十七日票决维持联邦法院的原判。据美联社十二日讯：美国当局已下令立即监禁但尼斯，以执行原判。
