On the Situation of the Norwegian Communist Party
Originally published in "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy" Chinese Edition No. 26
Lafflein, Chairman of the Norwegian Communist Party

	By the end of World War II, the influence of the Norwegian Communist Party among the masses had greatly increased as a result of the heroic struggle of the Communists against the fascist aggressors. However, in the post-war period, errors and shortcomings in the Party's policies greatly weakened this influence and brought the Party face to face with many great difficulties. The policy of the Party Central Committee on several principled issues meant a rejection of the class struggle and a turn to a bourgeois nationalist policy. These errors and shortcomings could not but have an impact on the results of the recent parliamentary elections.

	The Party has not been sufficiently active in countering the reactionary propaganda of the bourgeoisie and its running dogs—the right-wing social democrats, has not paid enough attention to the struggle for the urgent demands of the workers, and has not simply, definitely, and clearly pointed out the connection between this struggle and the defense of peace, democratic rights, and the national independence of Norway.

	The reason why the Norwegian Communist Party has not been able to vigorously wage the struggle against the enemies of the working class and democracy is because of the existence of an anti-Party sectarian group headed by the Party's former General Secretary, Floruboton, which has split the Party's forces.

	In December 1941, when the Party's leading cadres were either in fascist prisons or residing abroad, Floruboton became a co-opted member of the Central Committee, and later was elected as the political leader of the Norwegian Communist Party. At that time, most of the members of the Central Committee were also co-opted members.

	Floruboton quickly established himself as a dictator within the Party. The Party's policy, from 1942 until the end of the war, was actually Floruboton's personal policy. This policy was characterized by a shift from a class standpoint to a nationalist standpoint. The Party's established combat organizations were either disbanded or subordinated to the Norwegian government-in-exile in London and its representatives in the Norwegian bourgeoisie.

	Floruboton established the "Unified Resistance Center Against the Germans"; not by relying on the working class and advanced democrats to fight against the reactionary leadership of the so-called "Fatherland Front," but by negotiating with the London government. Because Floruboton failed to link the task of social liberation of the laborers with the national liberation struggle, the Party failed to make the working class the leader of the national liberation movement. In this way, Floruboton's purpose was completely consistent with the military goals of the Norwegian bourgeoisie.

	Everyone knows that Norway was occupied by Anglo-American forces during the process of liberation; the Anglo-American forces handed over the power in Norway to the imperialists and the Norwegian government headed by right-wing social democrats. After the war, Floruboton put forward a slogan: "No strikes, only production!" When the workers made demands to the government, asking the government to return the wages that Norwegian capitalists had deducted with the help of the fascist occupation forces, Floruboton contemptuously rejected this demand, calling the workers' struggle "petty haggling." When dockworkers refused to unload ships from Franco's Spain, Floruboton proposed a return to work. The capitalists could not but take advantage of this policy pursued by the Party Central Committee under Floruboton's leadership, and as a result, the exploitation of the Norwegian working class and other laborers was intensified "for the sake of national interests."

	On the question of Norwegian sovereignty, Floruboton also pursued an incorrect policy. In his "thesis," Floruboton declared, "The question of Norwegian sovereignty occupies a special place in our country's history—which is different from the history of many other countries. Therefore, this characteristic of national life imposes special obligations on us Norwegians, and forces us to link all policy issues with the foundations of national and people's life, that is, Norwegian sovereignty. Therefore, the Norwegian people should practically make the issue of sovereignty the starting point of Norway's entire policy."

	This way of framing the question has nothing in common with Marxism. Norwegian sovereignty is not the foundation of the nation and people's life. The foundation of the people's life is the existing mode of production in Norway. The foundation of a nation and its life is the stable commonality that people have formed in the past, which is based on the commonality of four basic characteristics: the same language, the same territory, the same economic life, and the same mental qualities manifested in the same characteristics of national culture—this is what Comrade Stalin teaches us. As long as one of these characteristics is absent, it is enough to make a nation no longer a nation.

	Starting from the non-Marxist way of framing the question, Floruboton made non-Marxist conclusions. He "forgot" that in a capitalist country, taking the issue of sovereignty as a starting point cannot "make all interests consistent"—it is impossible to make the interests of the exploiters consistent with the interests of the exploited. This will inevitably lead to "class cooperation," and thus to a greater degree of enslavement of laborers by capitalists.

	However, this does not mean that the struggle for Norway's national sovereignty is of no great significance to the Communist Party. In the current international situation, American imperialists are attempting to enslave the people and turn Norway into their own colony; defending our country's sovereignty from the encroachment of American imperialists is one of the most important tasks of the working class and its Communist Party. The victory of this struggle is only possible under one condition, that is, carrying out a ruthless class struggle against the sellers of sovereignty, against the Marshallized bourgeoisie and its running dogs—the right-wing social democrats.

	In every capitalist country, including Norway, there are warmongers, although each has different "characteristics." The warmongers are an alliance of nationalist militarists, the bourgeoisie, right-wing social democrats, and fascist conspirators and bandits. They are the enemies of national sovereignty. They are pro-American, and are linked to aggressive American imperialism. The ideology of this faction is various forms of nationalism. The pro-American faction also attempts to infiltrate its running dogs and saboteurs into the Communist Party, attempting to undermine the international solidarity of the working class and all laborers. It is impossible to combine the interests of these warmongers with the interests of the people, and therefore, it is impossible to combine all major policy issues with the issue of defending Norway's sovereignty today, as Floruboton wanted to do.

	This policy of Floruboton's is not helping the Norwegian Communist Party to fight for peace, democracy, and national independence, but is helping the enemies of the Party, the working class, and peace-loving people. His way of framing the question hindered the Party from launching a struggle against the Norwegian warmongers, neglected class contradictions, and subordinated the interests of the Communist Party to the "national interests," that is, to the interests of the part of the nation represented by the ruling class of Norway today. Lenin wrote that in every capitalist country, there are two nations. This cannot be forgotten as long as Norway is still ruled by the capitalist mode of production.

	Floruboton's views on the peasant question are also anti-Marxist. In October 1946, he publicly opposed the Party Central Committee and promoted slogans that only conformed to the interests of the rural bourgeoisie, talking about the so-called "equality" between agriculture and industry. Ignoring the decision of the Central Committee, and behind the Party's leadership, Floruboton put forward the following proposal: "The government and the parliament have put forward a task before the Norwegian people—to allocate 1 billion Norwegian kroner for the modernization of agriculture." He also declared that the parliament could not allocate this amount from the state budget, so the task of raising funds had to be placed before local government organs and democratic mass organizations, including trade unions, which should also use their strike funds for this purpose! Floruboton wanted to use this "ingenious" method to unite the workers and peasants of the whole country to fight for Norway's national sovereignty. He forgot about the struggle of the working class, poor peasants, and middle peasants against the urban and rural bourgeoisie who oppressed them. Of course, this policy did not receive sympathy among the working class.

	Moreover, in January 1948, Floruboton wrote in the Party magazine: "The working class must get rid of the tradition of hostility towards the peasants that has been passed down from generation to generation. The working class should completely integrate with the entire nation, and look at this issue in such a way that the vital needs of the peasants are an integral part of the class policy of the working class, because the peasants are a decisive factor in the struggle for Norway's sovereignty and independence."

	Every Communist knows clearly that this "view" has nothing in common with Marxism. Only the mortal enemies of the working class—the Trotskyites—would insist that the working class has a hostile attitude towards the peasants. This insistence of the enemies of the working class and the peasants has long been theoretically crushed by Marxists, and overturned in practice by the course of the class struggle itself.

	Floruboton's position on the issue of striving for peace can be explained by his declaration that war is inevitably inevitable. This line of Floruboton caused a situation in which the Party's leading cadres began to believe that the struggle for peace was useless and illusory. It is obvious that if such a view prevails within the Party, this Party cannot become the organizer of the struggle for peace. This view of Floruboton also affected the Party's representatives attending the Norwegian Peace Council, and doomed this committee to take a passive attitude towards the issue of organizing active struggles for peace in Norway. It was only due to the active participation of the members of the Central Committee of the Norwegian Communist Party that the Norwegian Peace Council was saved from complete collapse.

	Floruboton had attempted to use the sacred cause of striving for peace to pursue his own sectarian goals. This attempt has been resolutely countered. The honest fighters for peace in Norway have taken measures to eliminate Floruboton's running dogs from the Peace Council. This committee has been consolidated and has become a capable fighting organ.

	At the end of September 1947, the Information Conference of the Nine Communist Parties was held in Poland. The analysis of the post-war international situation in Comrade Zhdanov's report and in the decision adopted by the conference made the political errors made by the Norwegian Communist Party clear. The Party's General Secretary, Floruboton, should have mobilized all the Party's forces to make a self-critical analysis of his own activities and correct his mistakes in order to fundamentally transform the Party's policies. However, Floruboton took a different path. In October 1947, he resigned from the post of General Secretary and voluntarily stopped working in the leadership of the Party, that is, ran away from the Party. He also openly organized his own sectarian anti-Party group. He secured several "leading positions" for himself in the Party's central organs, in the Party's publishing bureau, and in the leadership of the Youth League, in order to use these organs to engage in sectarian activities.

	Thus, it is clear that Floruboton's sectarian group should be held responsible for the critical situation within the Party, and an open and resolute struggle against this sectarian group is the basic condition for the Party's continued existence.

	On October 20, 1949, activists of the Oslo City Party held a meeting. At the meeting, Comrade Strand Johannsen, member of the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee and Oslo City Councilor, made a report on "The Lessons of the Election and the Tasks of Communists," in which he sharply criticized the sectarian anti-Party group. Completely eliminating this group was declared the basic task of the Party. After this, the sectarian elements attempted to inflict another blow on the Party. The members of the Party Central Committee, who had mostly been under Floruboton's influence and were led by him in organizational terms, withdrew from the Party's leadership organs and abandoned their responsibilities. In this situation, Communists should have declared to the opportunists: Get out of here, hand over the positions entrusted to you by the Party that you have used to harm the Party. We will ensure that the leadership of the Norwegian Communist Party can lead the Party out of its current difficult situation.

	At present, the Norwegian Communist Party is working politically and organizationally to completely eliminate the sectarian anti-Party group. The leader of the enemies of the Party, former General Secretary of the Norwegian Communist Party, Floruboton, was expelled from the Party on October 25, 1949. Subsequently, several "oppositionists" developed open sectarian activities despite warnings from the Central Committee, and the Central Committee also expelled them from the Party, namely: Halsenfo, Vitlisen, and Eger Berger.

	The vast majority of Party members are unanimously opposed to Floruboton and firmly support the Central Committee. All honest Communists realize that raising revolutionary vigilance is one of the most important tasks of the Party.

	Ideologically and politically, Floruboton's anti-Party group is linked to the anti-proletarian Tito group. The activities of the Tito bandits—running dogs and spies of American imperialism—can also be felt in the Norwegian Communist Party. For example, Tito's running dogs in Norway sent so-called "reference messages" to the local organizations of the Norwegian Communist Party, which contained information about Tito's struggle against the Communist Information Bureau. All those who once believed that Floruboton's political views were accidental are now increasingly convinced that they are consciously formulated and cleverly disguised anti-communist nationalist views, views taken from the ideological arsenal used by the imperialist camp to fight against the working class, and to fight against the democrats and patriots who are engaged in the struggle for peace under the leadership of the Soviet Union and against the instigators of war.

	An urgent task facing the Norwegian Communist Party is to cleanse the anti-Party elements and consolidate its ranks ideologically and organizationally. Only a united Communist Party, guided by the invincible doctrine of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin, is capable of organizing an effective struggle against the right-wing social democrats—splitters and wreckers of the workers' movement, thereby achieving the unity of the working class forces. Only a Communist Party that understands the inseparable link between defending peace and defending the vital interests of the working class and the working masses can lead the broadest masses of the people to fight for peace and Norway's national independence.

	Such a Marxist-Leninist party, with a spirit of proletarian internationalism to fight against the enemies of the communist movement inside and outside the Party, is able to become the victor in this struggle.

　　论挪威共产党的情况
　　原载《争取持久和平争取人民民主》中文版廿六期
    挪威共产党主席　莱甫连
    到第二次世界大战快结束时，挪威共产党在群众中的影响，由于共产党员对法西斯侵略者进行了英勇斗争的结果，大大地加强了。然而，战后时期，党的政策有错误和缺点，使这一影响又大大地减弱了，并且使党面临了许多大困难。党中央对于若干原则问题的政策，意味着拒斥阶级斗争和转变为资产阶级民族主义政策。这些错误和缺点，对于最近一次议会选举的结果，是不可能没有影响的。
    党对于资产阶级及其走狗——右翼社会民主党人的反动宣传，未曾足够积极地给予还击，对于为劳动者的迫切要求而进行的斗争，未曾足够地加以重视，未曾简单地、确凿地、明白地指出这一斗争和保卫和平、民主权利与挪威民族独立的联系关系。
    挪威共产党之所以未曾强有力地进行反对工人阶级与民主之敌人的斗争，是因为有以党的前总书记佛鲁波顿为首的反党的宗派主义集团存在，使党的力量分裂了。
    一九四一年十二月，当党的领导干部或是在法西斯的监狱中坐牢，或是侨居外国的时候，佛鲁波顿成了中央委员会的合作委员，后来，就被选为挪威共产党的政治领导者了。当时，中央委员会的委员，大多数也都是合作委员。
    佛鲁波顿很快地就在党内，俨然做起独裁者来了。党的政策，从一九四二年起直到战争结束，实际上是佛鲁波顿的个人政策。这一政策的特点，就是从阶级立场转变为民族主义立场。党的利益，服从于“民族利益”。党所建立的战斗组织，或是被解散了，或是服从于伦敦的挪威流亡政府及其在挪威资产阶级中的代表。
    佛鲁波顿曾经建立“反德国人统一抵抗中心”；建立的方法，不是借助于工人阶级与先进民主分子对所谓“祖国阵线”的反动领导进行斗争，而是借助于与伦敦政府进行谈判。由于佛鲁波顿没有将劳动者的社会解放任务与民族解放斗争相联结起来，以致党未能使工人阶级成为民族解放运动的领导者。这样，佛鲁波顿的目的，便完完全全与挪威资产阶级的军事目的相一致了。
    大家都知道，挪威在获得解放的过程中，曾经被英美军队占领过；英美军队，曾经将挪威的政权，交给帝国主义者以及以右翼社会民主党人为首的挪威政府。战后，佛鲁波顿提出了一项口号：“不罢工，只生产！”当工人向政府提出要求，叫政府归还挪威资本家在法西斯占领军帮助下所减扣的工资时，佛鲁波顿轻蔑地拒斥了这一要求，将工人的斗争称为“斤斤计较”。当码头工人拒绝为来自佛朗哥西班牙的船只卸货时，复工是佛鲁波顿所提议的。资本家不可能不利用党中央在佛鲁波顿的领导下所奉行的这种政策，其结果就是“为了民族利益”，挪威工人阶级及其他劳动者所受到的剥削，便加强化起来了。
    在挪威主权的问题上，佛鲁波顿也奉行了不正确的政策。佛鲁波顿在其“论文”中宣称，“挪威主权问题，在我国历史上——它不同于许多其他国家的历史——占有特殊的地位。因此之故，民族生活的这一特色，就对我们挪威人加予了特殊的义务，并且迫使我们将一切政策问题，与民族和人民的生活基础即挪威主权相联系起来。因此，挪威人民应该实际上使主权问题，成为挪威整个政策的出发点”。
    问题的这种提法，与马克思主义是毫无共同之处的。挪威的主权，并不是民族和人民的生活基础。人民的生活基础，是挪威目前所存在的生产方式。民族及其生活的基础，是人们过去所形成之稳定的共同性，这种共同性产生的基础，是四种基本特征的共同性，即：语文相同，地域相同，经济生活相同，以及表现在民族文化特质相同方面的心气理质相同——斯大林同志是这样教导我们的。只要这些特征有一个不存在，就足以使民族不再是民族了。
    佛鲁波顿从问题的非马克思主义提法出发，就作出了非马克思主义的结论。他“忘记了”：在资本主义国家中，以主权问题为出发点，不可能“使一切利益相一致”——不可能使剥削者的利益与被剥削者的利益相一致。这必然会造成“阶级合作”，因而也是造成资本家对劳动者更大程度的奴役。
    然而，这并不是说，为挪威的民族主权而斗争，对于共产党是没有重大意义的。在当前国际形势条件下，美国帝国主义者们企图奴役人民，并且使挪威变成自己的殖民地；保卫我国主权不受美国帝国主义者们的侵犯，乃是工人阶级及其共产党之最重要的任务之一。这一斗争的胜利，只有在一种条件下才有可能，即进行无情的阶级斗争，反对主权的出卖者，反对马歇尔化的资产阶级及其走狗——右翼社会党人。
    在每一个资本主义国家中，包括挪威，都有主战派存在，虽然各有“特性”不同。主战派，即民族主义军人派、资产阶级、右翼社会民主党人、法西斯阴谋家与匪徒的联盟。它是民族主权的敌人。它是亲美派，是与侵略性的美国帝国主义有联系的。这一派的思想意识，即各种形式的民族主义。亲美派并且企图使自己的走狗及破坏者潜入共产党，企图破坏工人阶级与一切劳动者的国际团结。使这一主战派的利益与人民的利益相结合，是不可能的，因此，如象佛鲁波顿所想要做到的，使一切重大的政策问题与保卫今日挪威主权问题相结合，也是不可能的。
    佛鲁波顿的这一政策，不是在帮助挪威共产党为和平，民主与民族独立而斗争，而是在帮助党、工人阶级与爱好和平人民的敌人。他那种对问题的提法，妨碍了党展开反对挪威主战派的斗争，忽略了阶级矛盾，使共产党的利益服从于“民族利益”，也就是说，服从于今日挪威的统治阶级所代表之民族的一部分之利益。列宁写道，在每一个资本主义国家中，有两个民族存在。在挪威还是由资本主义生产方式所统治的时候，这一点是不可以忘记的。
    佛鲁波顿关于农民问题的见解，也是反马克思主义的。一九四六年十月，他公开反对党中央委员会，宣传仅仅符合农村资产阶级利益的口号，讲所谓农业与工业的“均等”。佛鲁波顿不顾中央委员会的决定，背着党的领导，提出了下列的建议：“政府与议会，在挪威人民面前摆下了一项任务——拨出十亿挪币来进行农业近代化”。他并且宣称，议会不可能从国家预算中拨出这笔款项，因此，征集款项的任务，就不得不摆在地方政府机关与民主群众团体面前，包括工会在内，为了这一目的，它们也应该利用自己的罢工基金！佛鲁波顿想以这种“天才的”方法，来使全国工农团结一致，为挪威的民族主权而斗争。他心目中忘记了工人阶级、贫农与中农反对压迫他们的城乡资产阶级的斗争。当然，这一政策在工人阶级中，没有得到同情。
    不仅如此，一九四八年一月，佛鲁波顿在党的杂志中写道：“工人阶级必须摆脱一代一代相传下来的敌视农民传统。工人阶级应该与全民族完全融合起来，并且这样来看这一问题，即：农民的切身需要，是工人阶级的阶级政策之组成部分，因为农民在为挪威的主权与独立的斗争中，是决定性的因素”。
    每一个共产党员都清楚：这种“观点”，与马克思主义是毫无共同之处的。只有工人阶级的死敌——托洛茨基分子，才会坚称工人阶级对农民有敌视态度。工人阶级与农民之敌人的这种坚称，早已被马克思主义者从理论上予以粉碎了，被阶级斗争的进程本身在实践中予以推翻了。
    佛鲁波顿在争取和平问题上的立场，可以用他宣称战争必然不可避免来加以说明。佛鲁波顿的这一路线，造成了一种情况，即党的领导干部，开始认为为和平而斗争是无用的和空幻的。很显然的，党内如果有这种观点流行，这个党是不能成为为和平而斗争的组织者的。佛鲁波顿的这一观点，也影响了党出席挪威拥护和平委员会的代表，并且使这一委员会对于在挪威组织为和平而积极斗争的问题，注定要抱消极态度。只是由于挪威共产党中央委员们的积极参预，才使挪威拥护和平委员会避免了彻底垮台。
    佛鲁波顿曾经企图利用争取和平的神圣事业，以遂行自己的宗派目的。这种企图，已经受到了坚决的还击。挪威的争取和平的正直战士，已经采取了办法来清除拥护和平委员会中佛鲁波顿的走狗。这一委员会已经巩固起来了，变成了有工作能力的战斗的机关。
    一九四七年九月底，在波兰举行了九国共产党情报会议。日丹诺夫同志的报告中以及该会议所通过的决定中关于战后国际形势的分析，使挪威共产党所作出的政治错误显明起来了。党的总书记佛鲁波顿，原应该动员党的一切力量，来对自己的活动作自我批评的分析和改正错误，以求根本转变党的政策。但是，佛鲁波顿走上了另外的道路。一九四七年十月，他辞去了总书记职位，自行停止了在党领导方面的工作，这就是说，从党中逃跑了。他并且公开地组织了自己的宗派的反党集团。他在党的中央机构中，在党的出版局中，在青年团的领导方面，都为自己保证了若干“领导地位”，以图利用这些机关，从事宗派活动。
    这样，显然可见：佛鲁波顿的宗派集团，应该对党内危急情况负责，与这一宗派集团作公开而坚决的斗争，乃是党继续存在下去的基本条件。
    一九四九年十月二十日，奥斯陆市党的积极分子，曾经举行会议。会上，党中央书记处委员、奥斯陆市工人议员斯特朗德·约翰森同志，曾经作了“选举的教训与共产党员的任务”之报告，在报告中，尖锐地斥责了宗派的反党集团。完全消灭这种集团，被宣布为党的基本任务。此后，宗派分子还曾经企图使党再蒙受一个打击。党的中央委员，曾经大都处于佛鲁波顿的影响下，并且在组织关系上是由他领导的；他们就退出了党的领导机关，放弃了自己的职责。在这种情况下，共产党员曾经应该向机会主义者们宣称：滚开，交出党所委托给你们而你们却利用来危害党的那些职位。我们将要保证挪威共产党的领导能够使党摆脱目前的困难情况。
    目前，挪威共产党正在从政治方面和组织方面，努力完全消灭宗派的反党集团。党的敌人的首领，挪威共产党前总书记佛鲁波顿，一九四九年十月二十五日被开除党籍了，其后，若干“反对分子”曾经不顾中央委员会的警告，发展公开的宗派活动，中央委员会也予以开除党籍了，他们即：哈尔森佛，维特利森和埃格尔·柏尔格。
    绝大多数党员，都一致反对佛鲁波顿，坚决支持中央委员会。一切正直的共产党员都认识到：提高革命警惕性，乃是党的最重要任务之一。
    在思想意识上和政治上，佛鲁波顿的反党集团，与反无产阶级的铁托集团是有联系的。铁托匪徒——美国帝国主义的走狗及间谍——的活动，在挪威共产党中，也是可以感觉得到的。例如铁托在挪威的走狗，对挪威共产党的地方组织发送所谓“参考消息”，其中是关于铁托反对共产党情报局的斗争的资料。凡是曾经认为佛鲁波顿的政治观点乃是偶然现象的人们，现在都日益深信，那是有意识地制定的和掩饰得很不坏的、反共产主义的民族主义见解，那是从帝国主义阵营所利用的思想意识武库中取出的见解；帝国主义阵营利用那种思想意识武库，与工人阶级作斗争，与在苏联领导下从事争取和平、反对战争挑拨者的斗争的民主分子与爱国分子作斗争。
    挪威共产党所面临的一项紧迫任务，即清除反党分子，从思想上和组织上巩固自己的队伍。只有全党团结一致的共产党，以马克思——恩格斯——列宁——斯大林的无往不胜学说为指南，才有能力组织有效的斗争，来反对右翼社会民主党人——工人运动的分裂者与破坏者，从而取得工人阶级力量的团结。只有了解保卫和平与保卫工人阶级和劳动群众切身利益的斗争两者有不可分的联系的共产党，才能领导最广大的人民群众，为和平与挪威的民族独立而斗争。
    这种以无产阶级国际主义精神为反对党内外共产主义运动敌人而斗争的马克思——列宁主义党，是能够成为这一斗争的胜利者的。
