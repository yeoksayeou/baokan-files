Xinhua News Agency, Zhoushan Front, 19th: A frontline reporter describes the scene of the People's Liberation Army landing on Zhoushan Island: On the afternoon of the 16th, the entire East Zhejiang sea was filled with thousands of sails. People's Liberation Army troops surged like a tide towards various crossing points, preparing to advance on Zhoushan. Heroic songs and bugle calls echoed everywhere on the coast. Soldiers used countless megaphones to proclaim their "letters of determination" and "pledges" to advance on Zhoushan, expressing their resolve to resolutely implement policies and discipline. At the order, thousands of warships sailed swiftly towards Zhoushan, riding the wind and waves. The boatmen and fishermen of Zhoushan, who were piloting the ships for the Liberation Army, excitedly raised their sails, weighed anchor, rowed their oars, steered steadily, and strove to be the first. They congratulated each other on the imminent liberation of their hometown. When the signal flares for landing on Zhoushan rose into the misty night sky, the people on the mainland coast cheered, "Our Liberation Army has arrived in Dinghai!" At that moment, on the ocean, from Zhenhai Port to Xiangshan Port, thousands of white sails, guided by countless navigation lights, pointed directly at Zhoushan, breaking through the waves. The Liberation Army soldiers on board sang heartily, "Talking about Zhoushan, mentioning Zhoushan, taking Zhoushan to liberate Taiwan." The heroic songs and loud bugle calls drowned out the roar of the sea. On the beaches of many islands, stood people yearning for liberation, excitedly waving and cheering to the Liberation Army, some even rowing boats to welcome them. The powerful People's Liberation Army troops landed continuously amid the warm welcome of the people.

　　前线记者报道千帆渡海解放舟山
    【新华社舟山前线十九日电】前线记者报道人民解放军登陆舟山本岛的情形说：十六日下午，整个浙东海面上千帆林立。人民解放军部队潮水般地涌向各个起渡点，准备向舟山进军。海岸上到处响起雄壮的歌声和军号声。战士们用无数只喇叭筒宣读着自己进军舟山的“决心书”和“保证书”，表示坚决执行政策、纪律，进军舟山的决心，号令一下，千百只战船，乘风破浪，疾驶舟山。替解放军驾船的舟山的船工、渔民们，兴奋地拉开篷、拔起锚、摇着橹、掌稳舵、奋勇争先。他们相互庆幸着自己家乡的即将解放。当登陆舟山的信号弹在夜雾茫茫的海上腾空而起时，大陆海岸边的人民都欢呼着：“阿拉（意即我们的）解放军到了定海啦！”这时，在海洋上，从镇海口直到象山港，几千张白帆在无数领航灯的导引下破浪直指舟山。船上解放军的战士们尽情地欢唱着：“说舟山，道舟山，打下舟山打台湾。”雄壮的歌声和嘹亮的号声掩盖了海涛的怒吼。在许多岛屿的海滩上，站满着渴望解放的人民，他们兴奋地向解放军们招手欢呼，有的还摇了船来迎接。强大的人民解放军部队，就在人民的热烈欢迎下源源登陆。
