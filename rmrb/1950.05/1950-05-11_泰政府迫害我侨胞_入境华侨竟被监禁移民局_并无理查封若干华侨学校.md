Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: The Thai Luang Phibunsongkhram government has recently arbitrarily imprisoned and persecuted our overseas Chinese compatriots. According to a Bangkok dispatch carried by the Singapore Nanyang Siang Pau on April 15th, the Thai Police Chief, Luang Chart Trakarnkosol, admitted to reporters on April 10th that the so-called "excess" overseas Chinese who have arrived in Thailand have been imprisoned in the Immigration Bureau. Those who want to be released on bail are required to pay a deposit of 5,000 baht (Thai currency, equivalent to approximately 8 million RMB) per person. Luang Chart Trakarnkosol also openly claimed that overseas Chinese who are sentenced to "deportation" do not need a fixed charge; anyone deemed "unnecessary" by the authorities can be sentenced to "deportation" at any time.

At the same time, the Thai Luang Phibunsongkhram government, under the pretext that some Chinese schools do not comply with the "Private School Regulations" and "promote politics," is conducting strict inspections. The Nantiao School in Wengdong County and the Xianglin School have been ordered to be closed down by the Thai Ministry of Education, leaving many overseas Chinese children out of school.

　　泰政府迫害我侨胞
　　入境华侨竟被监禁移民局       
　　并无理查封若干华侨学校
    【新华社十日讯】泰国銮披汶政府最近任意监禁和迫害我侨胞。据新加坡南侨日报四月十五日载曼谷通讯称：泰警厅总监銮察警于四月十日向记者发表谈话时承认：目前已至泰国的所谓“超额”华侨，都被监禁在移民局中。要具保外出者，规定每名要付担保金五千铢（泰币，共约合我人民币八百万元）。銮察警又公然声称：华侨被判“驱逐出境”，并不需要固定的罪名，凡当局认为“不需要”者，随时都有被判“驱逐出境”的可能。
    泰国銮披汶政府同时又以某些华校不合“民校条例”、“宣传政治”等为借口，进行严格检查。吻洞县南侨学校和象林学校已被泰国政府教育部下令查封，许多华侨儿童因此失学。
