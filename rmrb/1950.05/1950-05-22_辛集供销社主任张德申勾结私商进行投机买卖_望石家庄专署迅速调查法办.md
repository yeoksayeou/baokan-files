Xinji Supply and Marketing Cooperative Director Zhang Deshen Colludes with Private Merchants in Speculative Trading
Hope Shijiazhuang Prefecture Quickly Investigates and Prosecutes

Zhang Deshen, director of the Xinji Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative, colluded with private merchants to use public funds for speculative trading on numerous occasions. He also privately appointed relatives and friends, and suppressed veteran cadres within the cooperative. On December 23rd of last year, after receiving a telegram from the prefectural general cooperative stating "salt prices are soaring," he leaked the information to private merchants Liu Chengzhi (his old friend) and Bao Laoniu (his wife's nephew). The two engaged in large-scale speculation, purchasing 6,300 jin of edible salt from the state-owned company's consignment shop, "Rongxinghe," at 365 yuan per jin. Because of insufficient funds, Zhang Deshen privately lent them 1.2 million yuan of public funds, and helped them sell it to the supply and marketing branch at 615 yuan per jin. After deducting the weight loss, the two profited a total of 15.75 million yuan, equivalent to over 2,000 jin of rice at the time. Zhang Deshen, as a revolutionary cadre, acted as an economic intelligence officer for speculative merchants, tantamount to stealing state assets for his friends and relatives. Zhang Deshen believed that as a responsible cadre in an economic department, he held great power and could show off his abilities and prestige in front of relatives and friends, often fulfilling their requests. For example, an old friend of his, Di Xun, planned to sell iron rods, but lacked capital due to family difficulties, so he approached Zhang Deshen for a loan. Zhang immediately wrote a letter to the cadre stationed in Taiyuan who was promoting towels, instructing them to allocate a sum of money to him. The cadre stationed in Taiyuan was not satisfied with this arrangement, but felt that they could not disobey Director Zhang's personal instructions, and as a result, lent Di Xun a total of 37.876 million yuan. Later, prices rose and the currency depreciated, and Di Xun could not repay the loan. Other cadres in the cooperative became anxious and seized 2,401 jin of iron rods from Di Xun, but the remainder has not yet been repaid. Zhang Deshen's cousin, Wang Yongtang, and friend, Di Zhongzhen, etc., did not need much capital to do business, relying on him to find ways to circulate and borrow money. These people frequently stayed and ate in the cooperative, turning the supply and marketing cooperative into a guest house, which caused much dissatisfaction among the cadres in the cooperative.

In terms of appointing cadres, it was entirely based on personal connections. He privately appointed a total of six cadres in the cooperative. Among them, one was his younger brother, one was his younger sister, one was a degenerate element, one was a counter-revolutionary element, and one was an unreformed landlord element. His younger brother, Zhang Limin, has been concealing his brotherly relationship with Zhang Deshen since he started working in the cooperative, falsely claiming to be his former correspondent. In order to enhance his younger brother's prestige within the cooperative and create conditions for his promotion, he sent him to Zhangjiakou and Suiyuan to promote and sell 500 dozen towels (worth 11.795 million yuan, equivalent to 20,554 jin of rice at the time) and buy and sell livestock. Zhang Limin was young and inexperienced, and Zhang Deshen was worried, so he secretly found an old friend, Di Zhongzhen, to assist him, and then sent Wang Fengshan (his uncle) and Di Maishou (friend) to help. His purpose was to attribute all the credit to Zhang Limin when they returned victoriously, and also to secretly reward his relatives and friends to solve their family difficulties. Soon after Zhang Limin and others left, the cooperative's deputy director, Li Xin, returned from Taiyuan, saying that towels were difficult to sell there. Director Zhang scolded Li Xin to his face for being incompetent in business. Behind his back, he bragged to other cadres in the cooperative, saying: Limin's trip to Zhangjiakou to sell towels will definitely be quick and will earn 3 million yuan. This was to show that Li Xin was not as good as Zhang Limin, in order to suppress Deputy Director Li and elevate Zhang Limin. However, as a result, Zhang Limin and others were gone for three months, not only did they not make money, but they also lost 9,150 jin of millet, and there were missing receipts and expenditure documents, with the accounts estimated by Zhang Limin and Zhang Deshen. In addition, when selling livestock, Zhang Deshen gave the cooperative's tax invoice to his younger brother to help evade taxes (he admitted that five horses were not taxed), violating the state's tax policy. On another occasion, when the accountant, Wang Yi, went out on business and asked Zhang Deshen to take care of the office, 500,000 yuan was lost as a result, which has not yet been investigated and has not been reported. In short, Zhang Deshen's illegal behavior is extremely serious. The prefectural supply and marketing general cooperative and local party and government leaders are strictly investigating, and once all the cases are clarified, they will be given due punishment.

Editor's Note: According to what Liu Yongbin said in his letter, regarding Zhang Deshen's illegal behavior, if it is true, the Shijiazhuang Prefecture should immediately send Zhang Deshen to the court for punishment according to law. Please Shijiazhuang Prefecture investigate and deal with it quickly, and inform this newspaper of the results.

　　辛集供销社主任张德申勾结私商进行投机买卖     
    望石家庄专署迅速调查法办
    辛集镇供销社主任张德申勾结私商动用公款，屡次进行投机买卖，并私自任用亲戚朋友，打击社内老干部。去年十二月二十三日，他接到专区总社电告“盐价猛涨”的消息后，就把它泄漏给私商刘成之（他的老朋友）与鲍老牛（妻侄）。二人大肆投机，从国营公司代销店“荣兴和”以每斤三百六十五元购得食盐六千三百斤。因为资金不足，张德申又私将公款借给了他们一百二十万元，并帮助他们以每斤六百一十五元卖给供销分社。除了脱秤损耗外，二人共得利一千五百七十五万元，当时折米二千余斤。张德申身为革命干部，竟做了投机商人的经济情报员，无异于将国家资财窃盗给了自己的朋友和亲戚。张德申认为自己是一个经济部门的负责干部，大权在手，可以在亲朋面前显神通，耍体面，常常有求必应。如他的一个老朋友邸勋，打算贩卖铁棍，但因家中较困难，缺乏本钱，便找到张德申借款。张立刻写信给该社住太原推销毛巾的干部，让拨借一部款子给他。住太原的干部虽然不满意这样做，但又感觉张主任亲笔来信指示不敢违抗，结果借给邸勋款子共三万七千八百七十六万元。后物价上涨，货币下跌，邸勋还不了款，社内其他干部很着急，才找到邸勋扣回铁棍二千四百零一斤，其余至今尚未还清。张德申的表弟王永堂、朋友邸忠珍等做买卖都不用什么本钱，都是依仗他给设法周转挪借而干的。这些人常来常往的在社内住宿吃饭，把供销社变成了待客店，引起社内干部许多不满。
    在任用干部方面，完全是私人拉拢。该社经他私自任用的共六个干部。其中一个是他的弟弟，一个是他的妹妹，一个蜕化分子，一个反革命分子，一个未改造的地主分子。他的弟弟张力民到社工作至今，始终隐蔽他和张德申的兄弟关系，诡说是他过去的一个通讯员。在社内为了抬高自己弟弟的威信，制造提拔条件，打发他带毛巾五百打（值一千一百七十九万五千元，当时折米二万零五百五十四斤）到张家口、绥远推销与贩买牲口。张力民本来年青，没有经验，张德申不放心，便瞒着社内其它干部，找了过去的一个朋友邸忠珍做助手；二次又派去王凤山（他舅父）、邸麦收（朋友）去帮助。他的目的是将来胜利归来时，一方面都归功于张力民；一方面自己这些亲戚朋友也可以暗中得些报酬，解决家中困难。在张力民等刚走了之后，适遇该社副主任李炘由太原回来，说那里毛巾不好推销。张主任当面斥责李炘对业务无能。并在背后对社内其他干部吹大话说：力民这次到张家口推销毛巾一定很快，能赚三百万元。借此说明李炘不如张力民，以达到打击李副主任，抬高张力民的企图。但结果张力民等走了三个月之久，不仅没赚钱，还赔损小米九千一百五十斤，而且缺少收支单据，由张力民嘴说和张德申给估计着下的账。另外在出卖牲口时张德申把合作社的税票送给自己弟弟，帮助偷税（据他自己承认有五个马未上税），违犯国家税收政策。还有一次，会计王毅因事外出，请张德申照顾门户，结果遗失款五十万元，至今尚未查清，也没有向上报告。总之，张德申的犯法行为是极其严重的。专区供销总社以及当地党政领导上正在严格追查，一俟全部案件查清，即给予应得处分。
                                 （刘永彬）
    编者按：根据刘永彬来信所说，关于张德申的犯法行为，如果确实，石家庄专署应立即将张德申送交法院依法惩办。请石家庄专署迅速调查处理，并将结果告诉本报。
