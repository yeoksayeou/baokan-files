Yanggao Nanguan Branch Becomes Active
		Liu Zhengguo, Secretary of the Yanggao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

The Nanguan Chinese Communist Party Branch in Yanggao City, Chahar Province, was able to closely unite the masses, and was rated as a model branch in the county-wide award evaluation last July. In September, it also held a village people's representative meeting, which resolved the issue of poor peasants not being paid for using middle peasants' oxen to plow the land in the past, and smoothly completed the autumn plowing. During the autumn grain requisition, they challenged Dongyuan Village. Due to a lack of planning, they lost. Branch Secretary Li Sheng was afraid of "losing face" and was unwilling to deliver the red flag, feigning illness and staying in bed. The squadron leader braced himself and sent the red flag to Dongyuan Village. Afterwards, party members blamed each other, and the branch secretary did not provide leadership, resulting in disunity within the party. During the winter work, the branch also did not lead, and various tasks almost collapsed. It was not until February of this year that the branch committee members and party members listened to reports in the training class and understood the future of the revolution. At the same time, combined with ideological examination, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and the situation of the branch began to change. Branch Secretary Li Sheng first made a self-criticism, recognizing that his thoughts of "being afraid of trouble," "being afraid of being scolded," and "being afraid of losing face" were wrong. Under his influence, the eight party members who were trained at that time all made self-criticisms and criticized each other, and their thinking was straightened out. After returning to the village, they immediately convened a branch meeting, conveyed the spirit of the courses taught in the county training class, and reviewed the reasons why the autumn grain requisition challenge was lost to Dongyuan Village last year. Village cadres and party members all made self-criticisms, and everyone resolved to do a good job in spring plowing. On the evening of April 2nd, the branch committee held another meeting and criticized Branch Secretary Li Sheng's practice of taking over everything himself. The next evening, Comrade Li Sheng made a self-criticism at the branch meeting, and party members also offered him many suggestions. Lü Shengrui said: "Why wasn't I active in the past? Because if I did something wrong, Li Sheng would give me a hard time!" Village Chief Zhang Youhua said: "In the past, no matter what happened, as soon as I presided over a meeting, Li Sheng would say: 'You can't speak, let me preside!' That made me useless. In the future, as long as everyone discusses the work of the village government, see if I can do it or not!" Party member Du Yue said: "I didn't do work in the past because I wasn't needed, Li Sheng did everything!" Finally, everyone also sincerely made self-criticisms and expressed their willingness to lead the work in the village and play a leading role.

Since the Nanguan Village Branch carried out criticism and self-criticism, there have been great changes in ideological style, party members have become more active in their work, and their morale has also been high. Since the rain on May 1st, the whole village has been harrowing and sowing. As of the 7th, out of 2,051 mu of dry land in the village, 1,288 mu have been sown, and all 327 mu of gardens have been planted. In order to seize the time to rush the planting, party members led in sections and divisions of labor, mobilizing all 88 people in the 17 work teams, organizing manpower and animal power, and people pulling plows and seeders, overcoming the difficulties of labor and animal power, and completing the sowing task. Branch party members also actively promoted seed soaking. Lü Ruisheng, a member of the industrial committee, often took the seed mixing device and thermometer to teach seed soaking and mixing techniques to households. In the field sowing, 163 households (out of 227 households in the village) soaked and mixed seeds. They also helped solve the difficulties of spring sowing for the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, workers, and poor households. They also motivated the lazy man Yuan Runyue to participate in production. All 31 party members in the village are working hard to lead production. The masses reflected: "If the party members had led us to do this earlier, we wouldn't have lost the autumn grain requisition last year?" Now everyone is working hard, preparing to be a model again in the next award evaluation.

　　阳高南关支部活跃起来了
    中共阳高县委书记  刘正国
    察哈尔省阳高城南关中共支部，能够密切团结群众，去年七月全县评奖评为模范支部。九月间，又开了村人民代表会，解决了过去贫农用中农牛犋耕地不给工资的问题，顺利完成了秋耕。秋征时他们与东园村挑了战。由于工作缺乏计划性，输了。支部书记李生怕“丢脸”，不愿去送红旗，装病不起。中队长硬着头皮把红旗给东园村送去。往后，党员互相埋怨，支书也不加领导，结果党内闹得不团结了。冬季工作中，支部也不领导，各种工作几乎垮了台。一直到今年二月，支委、党员在训练班上听了报告，明白了革命前途。同时结合思想检查，进行了批评与自我批评，支部情况才开始转变。支书李生首先作了检讨，认识到自己“怕麻烦”、“怕挨骂”、“怕丢脸”的思想是不对的。在他的影响下，当时受训的八个党员都进行了检讨和互相批评，搞通了思想。他们回村后，马上召集了支部大会，传达县训练班所讲课程的精神，并检讨了去年秋征挑战输给东园村的原因。村干部、党员都进行了检讨，大家决心努力搞好春耕。四月二日晚上，又召开了支委会，对支书李生的包办代替作风进行了批评。第二天晚上，李生同志在支部大会上作了检讨，党员们也给他提了很多意见。吕生瑞说：“过去我为啥不积极？因为我一点小事作得不对，就叫李生碰个灰！”村长张有华说：“过去不管啥事，我一主持会，李生就说：‘你不会说，我主持吧！’这么一来我就没用了。今后村政权的工作，只要大伙讨论了，看我说得来说不来？”党员杜悦说：“过去我不作工作，是属不着咱，什么事也有李生！”最后，大家也都诚恳的作了检讨，都表示要把村里的工作领导好，起带头作用。
    南关村支部，自开展了批评与自我批评以来，在思想作风上有了大的转变，党员们工作积极了，情绪也高涨了。自五月一日下雨后，全村普遍耙地、播种。到七日止，全村二千零五十一亩旱地，已播种一千二百八十八亩、园地三百二十七亩全部种完。为了抓紧时间抢种，党员们分片、分工领导，把十七个拨工组八十八个人都推动起来，组织人畜拨工、人拉犁、人拉耧，克服劳畜力困难，完成了播种任务。支部党员并积极推广浸种。实业委员吕瑞生经常拿着拌种器、温度计，到各户传授浸种、拌种技术。在大田播种中，一百六十三户（全村二百二十七户）浸、拌了种。他们还帮助解决了烈、军、工属和贫苦户春播困难。并带动了懒汉袁润月参加生产。全村三十一个党员，都在鼓着劲领导生产。群众们反映：“党员要早领着这么干，去年秋征还能输？”现在大家都鼓着劲，准备在再评奖时仍旧是模范。
