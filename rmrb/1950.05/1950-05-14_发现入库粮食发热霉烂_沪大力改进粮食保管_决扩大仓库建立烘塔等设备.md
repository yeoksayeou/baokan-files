　　Discovery of Heating and Mold in Stored Grain
　　Shanghai Vigorously Improves Grain Storage
　　Decides to Expand Warehouses and Establish Drying Towers and Other Equipment

　　[This newspaper Shanghai News] Special correspondent Zhou Ziqin reports: In the East China grain transfer and storage, a small portion of grain has experienced mold and spoilage. Vigorous improvements are now underway, and initial results have been achieved. In this year's grain transfer, East China completed 80% of its entire grain transfer plan in a very short time, and vigorously prepared warehouses, enabling huge amounts of grain to be stored in a timely manner, ensuring a steady supply of food for the East China region and Shanghai. It has made great achievements in stabilizing prices and regulating supply and demand. However, due to certain shortcomings in the transfer and storage work, some grain has experienced mold or insect infestation. According to incomplete statistics, 7.5 per ten thousand of the stored grain was found to be heating, more than 180,000 jin were infested with insects, and about 90,000 jin were moldy. The causes of the heating and mold are: First, there were many specific objective difficulties. Such as: The amount of grain transported was huge, the time was tight, the task was urgent, there were insufficient cadres and lack of experience, and many warehouses were not originally grain depots, so the equipment was very poor. Second, the grain transferred this time had a high moisture content, and there were also some oversights in the grain transfer work in various places, resulting in the grain getting damp and easily moldy during transportation due to lack of rain protection equipment or leaky ship bottoms. Among the grains transported to East China, except for the Northeast, the moisture content in general areas reached 15% to 18%, with Southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi being the most prominent. Grain that was rained on and became moldy during transportation, such as in early March this year, more than 8 million jin of rice transported from Shanhaiguan to East China had more than 300,000 jin damaged by rain and mold (of which more than 100,000 jin had relatively light mold and was still edible). Grain that was moldy due to leaky ship bottoms, such as the rice recently transported from Jiangxi to Shanghai, reached 297 bags. Many other warehouses have also received similar reports constantly. Third, in terms of thinking on storage work, there was paralysis at the beginning, and some old personnel in the storage personnel lacked the spirit of being responsible to the people, so even though they discovered heating and mold, they failed to deal with it quickly. When heating and mold were found after the grain was stored, the warehouse's reports to the grain company were often delayed for a long time and could not be resolved in time. Some responsible comrades did not admit that such a situation existed when someone suggested to him that the grain was moldy and that the moisture content of the existing grain was too high, and that the storage problem was worthy of attention, and said that he had not received a report and that this opinion was unreliable. When the higher authorities emphasized storage work and the grain mold was indeed a fact, they were busy from morning till night, unable to sleep until 12 o'clock, but could not think of a good solution. Most of the old grain storage personnel were "just following orders" and did not dare to actively deal with insect-infested or moldy grain. For example, in the fourth warehouse, hundreds of bags of grain were infested with insects, and they only sprayed some insecticide powder on the outside of the grain bags, and wrote on the report form to the company: "Insecticide powder has been used for spraying." But the actual inspection results showed that the rice worms were still alive and the insect damage had not stopped. Many warehouses also showed a phenomenon of relying on higher authorities to deal with the problem without actively trying to find solutions when grain was found to be heating, which also aggravated the damage to the grain. In order to improve storage work, the Shanghai Grain Company has extracted 50 capable cadres to form a working group to go to various warehouses to conduct specific inspections and help various warehouses solve their difficulties. At the same time, it will increase warehouses to expand capacity, reducing the capacity of each existing warehouse by 40%. Leaving at least enough space to spread out 30 million jin of grain to dry. It also plans to add warehouse ventilation, dunnage and other equipment. In order to ensure that grain with excessive moisture and heat can be dealt with in a timely manner, it has been decided to build three drying towers (one has been completed), four blowers, and establish reward and punishment, reporting and on-site inspection systems. The East China Financial and Economic Committee and the East China Military and Political Committee Trade Department also convened grain storage meetings successively, calling on all grain workers to do their best to store this batch of grain and prevent further mold. And instructed the grain company to formulate a unified plan and specific measures for grain storage from the perspective of overall planning and deployment, according to the grain situation, and in order of priority and urgency. In recent days, the staff of each warehouse has been universally mobilized to carry out inspection, drying, spreading, turning over, day and night work, and has achieved initial results. For example, among the heating grain, after treatment such as drying and spreading, 60% has no problem. The remaining heating portion is also being vigorously rescued.

### 发现入库粮食发热霉烂　沪大力改进粮食保管　决扩大仓库建立烘塔等设备

　　发现入库粮食发热霉烂
　　沪大力改进粮食保管
　　决扩大仓库建立烘塔等设备
    【本报上海讯】特派记者周子芹报道：华东粮食调运与保管中，小部分粮食曾发生霉烂损坏现象，现正大力改进，并获有初步成绩。华东在今年粮食调运中，在很短时间内，完成了今年全部粮食调运计划的百分之八十，并大力准备仓库，使巨额粮食得以及时入库，保证了华东区及上海民食的源源供应，在稳定物价，调剂供求上，作出了很大成绩。但由于调运及保管工作中尚存在若干缺点，以致发生了部分粮食霉烂或生虫的现象。据不完全统计，入库粮食发热者达运到粮食的万分之七·五，生虫者十八万余斤，霉烂者亦在九万斤左右。造成发热霉烂的原因是：第一、客观条件有许多具体困难。如：运粮数量巨大，时间紧，任务急，干部人员不足而又缺乏经验，以及许多仓库原来并非粮库，因而设备很差。第二、此次调运的粮食，含水量较重，且各地运粮工作亦有某些疏忽，致在途中因缺乏防雨设备或船底漏水使粮食着潮而易于发霉。运华东粮食中，除东北外，一般地区的含水量，竟有达到百分之十五到百分之十八者，其中以苏南、浙江、江西等地为甚。在运输途中遭受雨淋潮湿而发霉的，如今年三月初，由山海关运华东大米八百多万斤中，即有淋湿而霉烂损坏者达三十多万斤（其中十余万斤霉烂较轻尚可食用）。因船底漏水而使粮食霉烂的，如最近由江西运沪的大米中即达二百九十七包。其他许多仓库亦曾不断收到。第三，在保管工作的思想上，开始时是麻痹的，并在保管人员中有部分旧人员，缺乏为人民负责的精神，致虽发现发热霉烂，亦未能迅速处理。粮食入库后发现发热霉烂时，仓库方面向粮食公司的汇报常常拖延很久，不能及时得到解决。有的负责同志当有人向他提出粮食霉烂情况以及现有粮食中含水量太重，保管问题很值得注意时，不承认有这种情况，并说并未接到报告，这种意见不可靠。及至上级着重保管工作，粮食霉烂确是事实时，即又一天忙到晚，十二点钟还不能睡觉，但又想不出好办法。部分旧的粮食保管人员又大都是“奉命办事”，对生虫或霉烂的粮食，不敢主动处理。如第四仓库有数百袋粮食生虫，他们只在粮食布袋外边喷射些杀虫粉，向公司的呈报表上即写着：“已用杀虫粉喷杀”。但实际检查结果，米虫仍然活着，虫害并未停止。还有许多仓库在发现粮食发热时，也有依赖上级处理而不主动积极想办法的现象，也加重了粮食的损坏。上海粮食公司为改进保管工作，已抽出得力干部五十人，组成工作组分赴各仓库具体检查，帮助各仓库具体解决困难。同时并增设仓库扩大容量，将现有每个仓库容量减少百分之四十。留出至少可容三千万斤粮食摊晾的地方。并拟增加仓库通风、垫仓板等设备。为了使水分过大及发热的粮食能得到及时处理，决定建立烘塔三座（已完成一座），吹风机四个并建立奖惩、汇报及巡回检查等制度。华东区财经委员会及华东军政委员会贸易部亦先后召开粮食保管会议，号召全体粮食工作人员，以全力保管此批粮食，不使再有霉烂。并指示粮食公司从全面计划与布置上，根据粮食情况，分别先后缓急，订出粮食保管的统一计划和具体办法。连日以来，各仓库人员均已普遍动员起来，进行检查、烘干、摊晾、翻桩、日夜工作，已获初步成绩。如在发热的粮食中，经过烘干、摊晾等办法处理后，有百分之六十已无问题。其余发热部分亦正大力急救中。
