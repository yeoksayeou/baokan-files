　　War Mongers' Sinister Faces Fully Exposed
    MacArthur Responds to Soviet Inquiry, Publicly Admits to Establishing Bases in Japan
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to a Hong Kong dispatch from Diantong Agency on the 4th: MacArthur, the commander of the U.S. occupation forces in Japan, in response to a letter of protest from Soviet representative Derevyanko of the Allied Council for Japan regarding the rearmament of Japan, admitted on the 4th that the United States is building a network of military bases in Japan. In his reply, MacArthur provocatively declared: "The bases and facilities of Britain and the United States in Japan are maintained in a state of constant readiness to cope with any eventuality." Regarding Derevyanko's inquiry about the U.S. construction of military bases in the Ryukyu Islands, MacArthur did not refute the Soviet accusation, but said: "The Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan have nothing to do with the administration of these islands." He also claimed: "Only the U.S. government has the right to decide on military activities in this area when it deems appropriate."
    A spokesman for the U.S. Far East Command announced in Tokyo on the 4th that the U.S. Air Force in the Far East will receive reinforcements of a large number of new jet fighters. The United States is currently building new airfields for jet aircraft throughout Japan. The U.S. rearmament of Japan plan, protested by Derevyanko, is part of the U.S. government's aggressive plan to establish a series of powerful war bases in the Pacific. This series of bases starts from the U.S. military base in Alaska, extending through the Aleutian Islands, Japan, Ryukyu, the Philippines, Borneo, Sumatra, and Indochina, all the way to Thailand, Burma, and even India. Because the United States anticipates the imminent fall of Taiwan, it is now emphasizing the importance of building Japan and the Philippines into fortresses. The United States is strengthening its bases in Misawa and Yokosuka on Japanese territory, as well as the U.S. bases in Busan and Jinhae in South Korea. It will also build more bases in Sasebo, Kure, Niigata, and Akita in Japan.

　　战争贩子阴险面目毕露
    麦克阿瑟答复苏联质询  公然承认在日建立基地
    【新华社六日讯】据电通社香港四日讯：驻日美国占领军司令麦克阿瑟，四日在答复盟国对日管制委员会苏联代表德勒维扬哥抗议重新武装日本的信中，承认美国正在日本建筑军事基地网。麦克阿瑟在复信中挑拨性地宣称：“英国与美国在日本的基地与设备，是维持在经常准备应付任何事故的状态下。”对于德勒维扬哥关于美国在琉球群岛建设军事基地的质询，麦克阿瑟并不反驳苏联的指责，但却说：“远东委员会与盟国对日管制委员会均与这些岛屿的行政无涉。”并称：“只有美国政府在它认为适当的场合下有权决定这个地区的军事活动。”
    美国远东参谋部发言人四日在东京宣称：美国在远东的空军将获得大批新的喷气式战斗机的增援。美国现正在日本各地为喷气式飞机建筑新的飞机场。德勒维扬哥所抗议的美国重新武装日本计划，是美国政府在太平洋设立一连串强大的战争基地的侵略计划的一环。这一连串基地是自阿拉斯加的美军基地开始，自阿留申群岛、日本、琉球、菲律宾、婆罗洲、苏门答腊及印度支那，直伸到泰国、缅甸以至印度。由于美国预料到台湾即将陷落，故现在正强调将日本与菲律宾建筑成堡垒的重要性。美国正加强在日本领土上的三泽与横须贺，以及在南朝鲜的釜山与镇海的美国基地。并将在日本的佐世保、吴港、新潟及秋田等地建筑更多的基地。
