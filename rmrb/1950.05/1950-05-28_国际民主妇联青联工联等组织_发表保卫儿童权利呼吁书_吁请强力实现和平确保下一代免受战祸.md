Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The International Democratic Women's Federation, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Federation of Teachers' Associations, and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers issued an appeal on April 10 regarding the protection of children's rights. The full text is as follows:

We, representing hundreds of millions of men and women, representing mothers, workers, and young people with children, appeal to all who care about the situation of children and their future to join us in defending them and saving them.

Millions of innocent young lives are threatened by the terror of the atomic bomb. Millions of children have already been orphaned by war. However, those who wield atomic bombs are not satisfied; they are intensifying preparations for another world catastrophe. Moreover, as a prelude to the massacre, they are already waging colonial wars in some Asian countries to spread terror. Wherever military spending is prioritized over spending on the next generation, children are deprived of the assistance they deserve from society. The poverty and unemployment of their families are growing. Children are suffering from the evil consequences of poverty and insecurity, which will seriously affect their future lives. On the one hand, there is a lack of schools; on the other hand, militaristic propaganda is spreading everywhere, promoting gangsterism and racial hatred.

In the colonies and dependent countries of Asia and Africa, tens of thousands of children are devastated, victims of hunger, disease, and appalling disasters. Millions of child laborers, from the age of six, are trapped in the most shameful exploitation of labor.

Our children have the sacred right to make demands on society, because they are the world of tomorrow, a world that will be determined by the extent to which these demands are met.

According to the United Nations Charter, fifty signatory states have undertaken the obligation to protect children, guarantee their right to education, ensure the possibility of their full development, and ensure that future generations are spared from war.

It is now up to the people of all countries and all men and women of goodwill to insist on these great principles that have not yet been respected. Children cannot defend themselves.

It is now up to mothers, fathers, and young people, up to all groups and organizations around the world—international, national, and cooperative—to unite, vigorously achieve peace, and enable children to enjoy the joy of life.

Women, young people, and working people, join us in celebrating International Children's Day—June 1st—participate in the preparations for the International Children's Defense Conference, and rise up everywhere to defend the rights to life, the rights to health, and the rights to democratic education of all children around the world!

　　国际民主妇联青联工联等组织
    发表保卫儿童权利呼吁书
    吁请强力实现和平确保下一代免受战祸
    【新华社二十七日讯】国际民主妇女联合会、世界民主青年联合会、世界工会联合会、国际教育工作者协会、国际民主律师协会曾于四月十日发表关于保卫儿童权利的呼吁书。全文如下：
    我们代表亿万男女，代表有孩子的母亲工人和青年，吁请一切关心儿童情况及其将来的人们，和我们一道，保卫他们，拯救他们。
    数以百万计的无辜的年青的生命受到原子弹恐怖的威胁。已经有了几百万的儿童由于战争而成为孤儿，但是，那些舞弄原子弹的人们还不心满意足，他们正在加紧准备另一次的世界大灾难；而且作为大屠杀的序幕，他们已经在亚洲若干国家进行殖民战争来散播恐怖。凡是视军事费用比较花在下一代身上的费用为优先的地方，那里的儿童就被剥夺了他们所应得自社会的帮助。他们家庭的贫困与失业正在增长。儿童们正在苦于贫乏与不安全的恶果，这种恶果将严重的影响他们将来的生活，一方面缺少学校，另一方面，军国主义的宣传正在到处传播，宣扬着匪徒精神与种族仇恨。
    在亚洲与非洲的殖民地与附属国家中，数万的儿童受到摧残，他们是饥饿、疾病与惊人灾祸的牺牲者。数百万的童工从六岁起，就陷于最可耻的劳力剥削之中。
    我们的儿童有向社会提出要求的神圣权利，因为他们是明天的世界，这个世界将以这些要求满足的程度而定。
    按照联合国宪章，五十个签字国已经承担了保护儿童，保障他们受教育的权利，保证他们充分发展的可能性和确保未来一代免于战祸的义务。
    现在有待于各国人民和一切善意的男女来坚持这些尚未受到尊重的伟大原则。儿童是保卫不了他们自己的。
    现在有待于母亲们、父亲们和青年们，有待于全世界一切团体和组织——国际性的、全国性的、合作社性质的——团结起来，强力实现和平，并使儿童获得生活的快乐。
    妇女们、青年们、劳动人民们，和我们一道参加国际儿童节——六月一日——的庆祝，参加国际儿童保卫大会的筹备，到处起来保卫全世界一切儿童的生活权利、健康权利和受民主教育的权利！
