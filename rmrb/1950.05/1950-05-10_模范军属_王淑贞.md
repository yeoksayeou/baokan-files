　　Model Military Family Member – Wang Shuzhen

　　Wang Shuzhen is twenty-eight years old and comes from Erdaohexun Village, Eighth District, Miyun County, Hebei Province. Her husband, Feng Defeng, joined the People's Liberation Army in 1944. The family has eight members. In 1948, the family farmed thirteen mu of land. At that time, during the large-scale Liberation War, all the labor force in the village was busy supporting the war. She thought, "There are many military families in the village. If we all wait for substitute cultivation, each male laborer in the village will have to bear three mu of land. I can cultivate these thirteen mu myself with some effort!" So she cultivated it herself, without needing the village to provide substitute cultivation, and tilled the land three times (only for tasks that one person cannot do alone, the village would help with some manpower and livestock). The crops were well managed. In the spring of 1949, she led Feng Yongda's wife and Feng Ruixian's wife to form a work team to work in the fields. In winter, she discussed starting a side business with her mother-in-law. Her mother-in-law agreed, only worried about the lack of manpower. Shuzhen said, "If we take out capital to make and sell tofu, we won't be able to sell it in our village, so I will carry it to other villages to sell." So, with five dou of soybeans as capital, she opened a tofu workshop. From October 15th to December 15th, in two months, she earned a total of two shi and five dou of white sorghum (twenty-six jin per dou), and also raised two fat pigs and sold one shi and two dou of millet.

　　In March of this year, she participated in the county's labor model conference and the county's second session of representatives from all walks of life as a model military family member, and won the flag for model military family member. On "March 8th" Women's Day, she attended the Hebei Provincial Women's Congress. She was very excited and often said to people, "Women must liberate themselves through labor and improve themselves. If I hadn't participated in labor, how could I have gone to the county and province to attend meetings and listen to the reports of the leaders?"

　　On March 20th, Shuzhen returned to the village from the provincial meeting. Two days before she returned to the village, she was elected as the director of the village women's federation at a village meeting. When she returned, many people came to see her, and she took this opportunity to publicize production policies to the masses. She called on all the women in the village to actively participate in labor, liberate themselves from labor, and improve themselves. Now, under the organization and leadership of Shuzhen, twenty-four women in the village have participated in production, and she also leads all the women and children in the village to gather wild vegetables to overcome famine.

　　Wang Shuzhen's name has spread throughout the county. Some village women's federations have written letters inviting Shuzhen to go to the villages to hold meetings for women and help organize production. Shuzhen also regularly reports her work to the county government, the county women's federation, the district government, and the district women's federation.

　　模范军属——王淑贞
    王淑贞今年二十八岁，是河北省密云县八区二道河村人，丈夫冯德峰在一九四四年参加了解放军，全家八口人。一九四八年，家里种着十三亩地，这时正在大规模的解放战争中，村中所有劳力忙于支援战争，她想：“村中军属很多，如果都等代耕，村中每一男劳力要负担三亩地，这十三亩地自己下点力气也能耕种！”于是她便自己耕作，不用村中代耕，将地作到三遍二坌子，（只在一人不能耕作的活计，由村中帮助一部分人力和畜力。）庄稼经营得很好。一九四九年开春，她带动了冯永达妻和冯瑞先妻，三个人组织了一个拨工组，到庄稼地里去作活计。到了冬天她便与婆婆商量搞副业，婆婆很同意，只愁没人手。淑贞说：“如果拿出本来作豆腐卖，本村卖不了，我担到外村去卖。”于是五斗豆子作本开了一个豆腐房，从十月十五日开张到十二月十五为止，二个月的时间，共挣了二石五斗白高粮（二十六斤一斗），还喂了二口肥猪，卖了一石二斗小米。
    今年三月，她以模范军属的资格参加县的劳模会议，和县的二届各界代表会议，荣获了模范军属的奖旗。“三八”节她出席了河北省妇代大会。她非常兴奋，常对人说：“妇女一定要由劳动中解放自己，提高自己。我要不是参加劳动，那里能到县、省去开会，亲听各首长的报告呢？”
    三月二十日淑贞由省开会回到村里。在她还没回到村的前二天，村里开会时即被选为村妇联会主任了。她回来的时候，许多人来看她，她即趁此机会向群众宣传生产政策。她号召全村妇女积极参加劳动，从劳动中解放自己，提高自己。现在全村妇女在淑贞的组织带动下，已有二十四名妇女参加了生产，并领导全村妇女儿童打野菜渡灾荒。
    王淑贞的名字已传遍了全县，有的村妇联会写信请淑贞到村去给妇女开会，帮助组织生产。淑贞并经常将她的工作向县政府、县妇联、区政府、区妇联作报告。
