Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The movement against the anti-communist speech by Isles, the education advisor of MacArthur, initiated by students of Tohoku University in Japan, has begun to develop into a movement by Japanese students against American imperialism. According to a Tokyo dispatch from foreign bourgeois news agencies, Japanese students held a demonstration rally in Hibiya Park, Tokyo, on the 16th to support Tohoku University's opposition to Isles' anti-communist activities and to oppose imperialist war and aggression policies. The rally was hosted by student organizations such as the Tokyo Student Autonomy Association Federation and the Japan Youth Fatherland Front. A total of 5,000 students from ten universities in Tokyo participated, and the General Association of Chinese Students Studying in Japan and the Korean Student League also participated in the rally. The participants held high red flags and placards with what Reuters called "the most intense" anti-American occupation authorities slogans "seen in Japan to date". In addition to denouncing Isles as an imperialist warmonger, the slogans also included: "Smash Isles' Statement," "Learn from Tohoku University," "Drive Out the Imperialists," "Any government that uses atomic weapons first is a war criminal," "No Second Hiroshima," "Freedom, Peace, and Independence," and "Conclude a Comprehensive Peace Treaty as Soon as Possible."

The presidium, as well as Japanese Communist Party Senator Kakuro Hosokawa, Kentaro Kaneko of the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee, and Zishiro Yoshida, chairman of the Japan Federation of Industrial Unions, addressed the conference. Chinese and Korean students also delivered speeches at the conference. A representative of the Japan Youth Fatherland Front told the masses at the meeting: "Due to the victory of the Chinese people, the imperialist war base has retreated from the Asian continent to Japan." He pointed out that Hirohito was a war criminal and criticized MacArthur's crime of arbitrarily releasing Japanese war criminals. He called on the Japanese people to drive the imperialists to the other side of the Pacific Ocean. The conference read out letters from the Japanese Communist Party and the two major progressive trade unions, the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee and the Industry Federation, supporting the student anti-imperialist movement.

Finally, the conference passed a petition requesting the Far Eastern Commission to stop Isles' anti-communist activities in Japan. The conference issued a declaration stating: "We vow to learn from the students of Tohoku University and respond to the call to oppose war and defend peace"; the conference also issued fifteen slogans such as "Withdraw Isles' Statement," "Oppose Turning Japan into an Imperialist Powder Keg," "Expedite the Conclusion of a Permanent Peace Treaty Based on the Potsdam Declaration," "Prohibit All Atomic Weapons," and "Strive for National Liberation in the Struggle Against International Imperialism." After the meeting, the students held a demonstration parade throughout the city.

The American and Japanese reactionaries dispatched hundreds of police to "maintain order." Officials of the American occupation authorities arrogantly forced students to remove some placards. American intelligence officers unreasonably interrogated some students and took pictures of them. Plainclothes agents also mixed into the ranks of the demonstrating students in an attempt to create incidents, but were exposed by the students and failed.

　　驱逐帝国主义者！
　　日本学生举行反帝示威         
　　要求根据波茨坦宣言缔结永久和约
    【新华社十九日讯】日本东北大学学生所发动的反对麦克阿瑟教育顾问意尔斯反共演说的运动，已开始发展为日本学生反对美帝国主义的运动。据外国资产阶级通讯社东京消息：日本学生于十六日在东京日比谷公园举行支援东北大学反对意尔斯反共活动及反对帝国主义战争与侵略政策的示威大会。大会是东京学生自治会联合会及日本青年祖国阵线等学生团体主持的，参加者共有东京的十个大学的学生五千人，留日中国学生同学总会及朝鲜学生同盟也参加了大会。与会者高举着红旗和迄今“出现在日本的最猛烈的”（路透社）反对美国占领当局的标语牌。标语除斥责意尔斯是帝国主义战争贩子外，尚有：“粉碎意尔斯声明”、“向东北大学看齐”、“驱逐帝国主义者”、“任何第一个使用原子武器的政府就是战犯”、“不要第二个广岛事件”、“自由和平独立”及“早日缔结全面和约”等。
    主席团以及日本共产党参议员细川嘉六、全日工会联络委员会的金子健太、日本产业别工会联合会主席吉田资治先后向大会致词。中国和朝鲜学生也在大会上发表了演说。日本青年祖国阵线的代表告大会群众称：“由于中国人民的胜利，帝国主义的战争基地从亚洲大陆退到了日本”。他指出裕仁是个战犯，并抨击麦克阿瑟擅自释放日本战犯的罪行。他号召日本人民把帝国主义者赶到太平洋对岸去。大会宣读了来自日本共产党以及全日工会联络委员会与产联两大进步工会支持学生反帝运动的信件。
    最后，大会通过一项请愿书，要求远东委员会停止意尔斯在日本的反共活动。大会发表宣言称：“我们宣誓要向东北大学同学看齐。响应反对战争拥护和平的号召”；大会并发表“撤回意尔斯声明”、“反对把日本变为帝国主义者的火药库”、“根据波茨坦宣言速即缔结永久和约”、“禁止一切原子武器”及“对国际帝国主义斗争争取民族解放”等十五项口号。会后，学生在全市举行了示威游行。
    美日反动派曾出动了上百的警察“维持秩序”。美国占领当局的官员横蛮地强迫学生取消一些标语牌。美国的特务官员向一些学生作无理的盘诘，并把他们的像照下来。便衣特务亦曾混入示威的学生队伍中，企图制造事件，但因被学生识破而未得逞。
