Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: The Northeast Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company is actively opening up cloth sources to supply the people of Northeast China. To adapt to the new situation of increased purchasing power among the broad masses of workers and peasants, the company has allocated a total of more than 1.3 million bolts of cotton yarn and cloth since April, which are sold through local department stores (more than double the 630,000 bolts sold in the first quarter of last year). Many of these are transported by the company from Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Jinan, and other places within the customs, and their quality and color are welcomed by workers and peasants. At the same time, the company has also organized private weaving industries in various places to produce in order to supplement the insufficient supply of cloth. In April alone, the entire Northeast processed and produced more than 117,000 bolts of cloth. As a result, the private weaving industry has developed greatly. For example, the private weaving industry organized by the Liaodong Provincial Department Store had only 79 machines and 150 workers processing and weaving cloth for the state in March. Currently, it has increased to 400 looms and more than 800 workers. At present, 90 percent of the entire private weaving industry in the province has been restored.

    积极开辟布匹来源  供应工农群众需要
    私营织布业因之大有发展
    【本报讯】据新华社沈阳电：中国花纱布公司东北区公司积极开辟布匹来源，以供应东北人民。该公司为适应广大工农群众购买力提高的新情况，自四月份以来，先后拨出纱布共达一百三十余万匹，通过各地百货公司销售（比去年第一季度销售量六十三万匹增加一倍以上）；其中有不少是该公司从关内天津、青岛、上海、济南等地运来的，质量、色泽均受工农群众欢迎。同时，该公司又组织了各地私营织布业生产，以补布匹供应之不足。仅四月份全东北加工生产的布匹即达十一万七千余匹。私营织布业因之有了很大发展。如辽东省百货公司所组织的私营织布业，三月份为国家加工织布的机器仅七十九台，工人一百五十人；目前已增至织布机四百台，工人八百余。现该省全部私营织布业已恢复百分之九十。
