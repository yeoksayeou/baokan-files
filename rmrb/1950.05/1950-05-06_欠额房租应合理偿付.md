　　Owed Rent Should Be Reasonably Compensated
　　To the Editor:
　　Are there any laws stipulating how to compensate for owed rent? Is there a specific amount? Should the compensation be determined based on the tenant's current living situation?
　　Li Fuqun

　　Mr. Li Fuqun:
　　Regarding your inquiry, the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau has responded as follows:
　　How to determine the owed rent, and whether rent is owed at all, should generally be based on the rent book or rent receipts. In specific circumstances, it is quite complex. Sometimes the tenant doesn't pay; sometimes the landlord temporarily abandons their rights after repeated demands for payment; sometimes the landlord simply doesn't ask for it, etc. There are no explicit legal provisions on how to compensate. However, in essence, the tenant is living in the house without paying a price, causing losses to the landlord. Therefore, when the landlord demands compensation for this loss, it should be reasonably compensated through negotiations between the landlord and the tenant based on the specific circumstances. The amount of compensation should not solely depend on the tenant's living situation. If the tenant is truly impoverished, the landlord should allow the tenant to compensate in installments. If the two parties cannot reach an agreement on their own, they can apply to the district office for resolution.

　　欠额房租应合理偿付编辑同志：
    在法律上有无规定欠租如何偿付的办法？有没有一定金额？偿付是否应根据欠租人生活现状而决定？
    李抚群李抚群君：
    所询问题，已经由北京市民政局答复如下：
    欠租问题如何确定，是否欠租，一般应以租折或租金收据为凭。在具体情形上，则是相当复杂的。有的是房客不给；有的是在屡催不付之后，房东暂时弃置权利的；有的是房东根本没要等。如何偿付在法律上，尚无明文规定。但实质上是房客没有付出代价而住着房屋，使房东受到损失，因此房东要求补还这种损失时，应由房主及房客根据具体情况协商合理偿付。补偿多少，不应单纯取决欠租人的生活状况，如房客确实贫困，房主应允许房客分期补偿的。如双方自行协议不成，可到区公所申请解决。
