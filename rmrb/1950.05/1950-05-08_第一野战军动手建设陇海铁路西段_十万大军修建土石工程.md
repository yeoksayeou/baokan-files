　　The First Field Army Starts Construction on the Western Section of the Longhai Railway
    100,000 Troops Build Earth and Stone Works
    [Our Correspondent in Tianshui] (Reporter Chen Ji reports): The People's Liberation Army's First Field Army has dispatched 100,000 troops to engage in the earth and stone construction projects on the Tianshui-Baoji and Tianshui-Lanzhou sections of the Longhai Railway. This large-scale project has already vigorously commenced on the Tianshui-Baoji section. The Tianshui-Baoji section is 153 kilometers long and, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, was long neglected, resulting in frequent collapses of earthworks along the line, blocking the roadbed and affecting traffic. After the Northwest Military and Political Committee decided to repair this line, units such as the PLA First Field Army volunteered to undertake the earth and stone works. All units made thorough preparations for two months before starting work. A certain corps stationed in Shaanxi organized a vanguard unit in early March to go to the treacherous Qinling Mountains to fell trees, cut bamboo, cut grass, and gather firewood, weave baskets, and make their own tools; and built countless houses in the deep mountains and valleys to prepare for the road construction troops. Some units in some areas contacted engineering personnel in advance to check the foundations and measure the earthworks; and conducted technical education for the soldiers. Some units went to the site for internships to learn how to use tools and study labor organization in order to be prepared to launch a production battle.
    In early April, the units set off for the construction sites one after another, and the people along the line warmly welcomed them. People's representatives from all walks of life in Chang'an, Xianyang, E County, Xingping, and Wugong counties competed to present brocade banners. The soldiers were overjoyed and said, "We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions and launch a large-scale production movement." In the early stages of construction, work efficiency was quite low, with each person completing only one cubic meter of earthwork on average in five hours. The soldiers were not discouraged at all, and they all had this confidence: "As long as we learn technology with our hearts, we will definitely be able to improve work efficiency." For example, they found that it was inconvenient to transport soil with baskets and that it was too slow to dump the soil, so they changed to using winnowing fans, which made it possible to dump all the soil without putting down the carrying pole. In the construction area, slogans such as "Learn technology from engineers" were posted everywhere, and they repeatedly studied the method of digging soil in the spirit of "learning while doing"; after work every day, they held "Zhuge Liang meetings" to review the daily work and introduce everyone's experience in digging and carrying soil. Because of their active study, work efficiency has improved, and now each person can complete an average of three cubic meters of earthwork in five hours. The soldiers' enthusiasm for production is high. No matter how narrow the mountain roads or how high and dangerous the mountains, they never tire of active labor. Some people learned to use slope rulers, slope lines, and horizontal lines in three or four days. Now, the soldiers are formulating production plans, preparing to launch production competitions, complete the most arduous production tasks, and strive to make contributions in the struggle for production.

　　第一野战军动手建设陇海铁路西段
    十万大军修建土石工程
    【本报天水讯】记者陈迹报道：人民解放军第一野战军抽调十万大军，从事陇海铁路天（水）宝（鸡）、天（水）兰（州）段土石方建设工程。这一大规模的工程，已在天（水）宝（鸡）段热烈展开。天宝段长一百五十三公里，在国民党反动统治时期，长期未得整修，沿线土方经常崩坍，堵塞路基，影响交通。西北军政委员会决定整修这条线路后，第一野战军某某等部自愿担任土石方工程。各部队在动工前两月，都作了充分的准备工作。驻陕西某兵团于三月初即组织先遣部队，到险峻的秦岭山巅，伐木，砍竹，割草，打柴，编织箩筐，自造工具；并在深山峡谷中，搭成无数房屋，替修路部队做好准备工作。有些地区的部队事先与工程人员联系，检查地基，测量土方；并对战士进行技术教育。有些部队先赴现场实习，学习使用工具的方法，研究劳动组织，以便有准备地展开生产战斗。
    四月初旬，各部队纷纷开往施工地点，沿线人民热烈欢迎。长安、咸阳、鄂县、兴平、武功等县各界人民代表争献锦旗。战士们欢欣鼓舞，他们说：“我们要坚决执行毛主席的指示，展开大生产运动。”在动工的初期，工作效率颇低，每人平均五小时仅完成一立方公尺的土方。战士们毫不气馁，他们都有着这样的信心：“只要我们用心学技术，一定能提高工作效率。”例如：他们发现了用筐子运土不方便，倒土太慢，就改成簸箕，倒土时不必放下担子，就可使土全部倾下。在施工地区，贴满了“向工程师学习技术”的标语，他们以“边做边学”的精神，反复研究挖土的方法；每天收工以后，召开“诸葛亮会”，检讨每天工作的情形，介绍各人挖土、担土的经验。由于他们积极钻研，工作效率已见提高，现在每人平均五小时已能做完三立方公尺的土方。战士们生产情绪高涨，不管山路如何狭窄，山岭如何高险，他们从不疲乏的积极劳动。有些人在三四天内，就学会了坡度尺、坡度线和水平线的使用。现在，战士们正在订立生产计划，准备展开生产竞赛，完成最艰巨的生产任务，争取在生产斗争中立功。
