　　Changzhi Special District Holds Meeting
    Strengthen Grain Storage Work
    [This Dispatch] In order to inspect the grain clearance work in April and study methods to improve future grain storage and prepare for the summer storage, the Changzhi Special District Grain Depot of Shanxi Province convened a meeting of directors of branch grain depots in various counties from May 1st to 7th. According to the meeting's inspection, many model cadres in grain storage were discovered in the process of clearing warehouses in the fifteen counties. Under difficult conditions such as poor warehouse foundations, low grain quality, and extremely poor storage equipment, they actively and proactively made considerable achievements. For example, Wang Jinshan and two other cadres from the Jincheng Branch Grain Depot conducted inspections even at night. Long Fushun, the acting director of Shenjiaping Village Grain Depot in Ping Shun County, has been in charge of warehouse work for five or six years, and there has never been any spoilage or damage to the grain. Wang Youcai, the acting director of Wangduzhuang Grain Depot in Lucheng County, has been storing grain since 1946 without any damage. During the warehouse clearance, acting depots such as Dongqingbei in Ping Shun County also formulated plans to ensure that the grain will not rot or be damaged in the future. However, under the same conditions, due to the neglect of storage work by responsible leaders and the lack of a sense of responsibility among cadres, 0.56% of the stored rice and 0.47% of the stored wheat suffered from mold and rot. In addition, there were 1,577 catties of millet that were 80% spoiled, more than 100 catties that were 60% spoiled, more than 8,800 catties that were 40% to 50% spoiled, and 25,000 catties of wheat that were 30% to 80% spoiled.
    In order to complete the warehouse clearance work by the end of June and improve future work, the special district focused on discussing the problems existing in grain depot storage, analyzed and reviewed the causes of grain spoilage, and criticized the wasteful phenomena and superficial work style in the warehouse clearance work. This has promoted the warehouse clearance work a step further.

　　长治专区召开会议
    加强粮食保管工作
    【本报讯】山西省长治专区粮库为检查四月份清仓工作，并研究改进今后粮食保管办法，作好夏屯准备，于五月一日至七日召开各县分粮库主任会议。据会议检查了解，十五个县中，在清仓过程中，发现了不少保管粮食的模范干部。他们在库基不好、粮质又低、保管设备极差的困难条件下，积极、主动地做出不少成绩。如晋城分粮库干部王金山等三人，黑夜也进行巡查。平顺县申家坪村代库主任龙富顺担任仓库工作五、六年，从未发生粮食腐烂、脱损现象。潞城县王都庄代库主任王有才，保管粮食从一九四六年到现在，也没有损坏过粮食。平顺县东青北等代库，在清仓当中，并订出计划，保证今后粮食不腐烂、不脱损。但在同样条件下，也有因负责领导者忽视保管工作，以及干部责任心差，致使存米的百分之○·五六和存麦的百分之○·四七遭受了霉烂。此外，尚有小米坏到八成的一、五七七斤，坏到六成的百余斤，四、五成的八、八○○余斤，坏了小麦三成到八成的二五、○○○余斤。
    该专区为使清仓工作能在六月底前完成，并改进今后工作，曾着重讨论了关于粮库保管中存在的问题，对坏粮原因作了分析和检讨，并批判了清仓工作中的浪费现象和不深入的作风。这对今后清仓工作推进了一步。
