　　Regarding the Fabrication of the Matter of Tokuda Requesting the Soviet Union to Delay the Removal of Reactionaries
　　The Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Issues a Letter to the People
　　Exposing the Slanderous Conspiracy of the American and Japanese Reactionaries
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 5th] The American and Japanese reactionaries, in order to realize their conspiratorial attempt to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal, recently fabricated the so-called "crime" of "Tokuda requesting the Soviet Union to delay the repatriation of reactionaries" and summoned Japanese Communist leader Tokuda Kyuichi for questioning. As early as March 16th, the Special Committee for Repatriation of Prisoners of the Japanese Senate summoned Tokuda. On April 27th, the House of Representatives Examination Committee, established in imitation of the American "Un-American Activities Investigation Committee," also summoned Tokuda on the same pretext. However, this fabrication by the reactionaries was powerfully refuted by Tokuda, so the reactionaries fabricated a "perjury charge" against Tokuda, falsely claiming that his testimony in both the Senate and House of Representatives was "inconsistent," and the chairman of the Examination Committee declared that he would prosecute Tokuda for "perjury." However, under the exposure and condemnation of ironclad facts and progressive public opinion, the reactionaries' fabricated "perjury charge" against Tokuda Kyuichi has been exposed. According to a dispatch from the Kuomintang remnant bandit Central News Agency in Tokyo on the 1st, the Examination Committee's matter of prosecuting Tokuda for "perjury" has been decided to be "temporarily shelved" because those fabricated "charges" are "insufficient to file a public prosecution." However, the reactionaries' slanderous conspiracy has not been dismissed. According to a dispatch from the same day by the Kuomintang remnant bandit Central News Agency, the House of Representatives Examination Committee will "collect more evidence" and "conduct further research" and "consult" with the Allied Control Council for Japan, manipulated by American representative Sebald.
    According to a dispatch from Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo, April 30th, the 19th Central Committee Plenary Session of the Japanese Communist Party unanimously passed the "Letter to All the People Regarding the Fabrication of the Matter of Tokuda Requesting the Soviet Union to Delay the Removal of Reactionaries" on April 29th. The letter declares that the Examination Committee, on the one hand, refuses to deal with some corruption cases related to the Liberal Party, and on the other hand, deliberately raises the so-called "Tokuda case" issue. However, none of the reasons listed are related to General Secretary Tokuda or the Japanese Communist Party. As for the "perjury charge," it is a conspiracy by the reactionaries using a forged JCP directive as "evidence."

　　关于捏造德田要求苏联缓撤反动分子事
    日共中央发表告人民书
    揭穿美日反动派的诬陷阴谋
    【新华社五日讯】美、日反动派为了实现其宣布日本共产党为非法的阴谋企图，最近曾以捏造所谓“德田要求苏联从缓遣回反动分子”的“罪状”，传讯日共领袖德田球一。早在三月十六日，日本参院遣俘特别委员会即曾传讯德田。四月二十七日，仿照美国“非美活动调查委员会”而成立的众院考查委员会，也以同一借口传讯了德田。但反动派的这种捏造受到德田的有力驳斥，于是反动派又对德田捏造了一个“伪证罪”，诬称他在参众两院所作的证言，“前后不符”，考查委员会的主席并宣称要对德田按“伪证罪”起诉。但是，在铁的事实与进步舆论的揭露和斥责下，反动派捏造的所谓德田球一的“伪证罪”已被揭穿。据国民党残匪中央社东京一日电透露：考查委员会对德田“伪证罪”起诉事宜，已决定“暂予搁置”，因为那些捏造的“罪状”，“不足以提起公诉”。但反动派的诬陷阴谋并非就此打销。据国民党残匪中央社同日电透露：众院考查委员会将“搜集更多的证据”，“作进一步研究”，并与美国代表赛鲍尔操纵下的对日管制委员会“商量”。
    另据共同社东京四月三十日讯：日共第十九次中央委员会全体大会，于四月二十九日一致通过“关于捏造德田要求苏联缓撤反动分子事告全体人民书”。该书宣称：考查委员会一方面拒绝处理一些有关自由党的腐败案件，另一方面却故意提出所谓“德田案”问题。但其所列举的理由却没有一条是和德田总书记及日共有关系的。至于“伪证罪”，乃是反动派以伪造的日共指令为“证据”的阴谋。
