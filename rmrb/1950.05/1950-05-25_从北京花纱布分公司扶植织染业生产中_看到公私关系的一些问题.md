　　Some Problems Seen in the Relationship Between Public and Private Sectors in Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Support for Weaving and Dyeing Industry Production
　　Wang Jing
　　After March this year, prices stabilized and speculative trading greatly decreased. Cloth, which had been hoarded for speculative purposes, was released in large quantities, causing the market price of cotton cloth to fall below the cost of production, which increased the temporary difficulties of the weaving and dyeing industry in production. This situation is basically the same in Beijing as in other large cities.
　　Over the past year, the weaving and dyeing industry in Beijing has generally not actively and voluntarily made efforts to improve its operations, resulting in low product quality and high costs. In the past, the Beijing branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company lacked planning in supporting the production of the weaving and dyeing industry, and individual cadres did not have a clear enough view of "serving production." The failure to properly handle the relationship between the public and private sectors also affected the production of the weaving and dyeing industry. To overcome the current difficulties of the weaving and dyeing industry, the main thing should be for the weaving and dyeing industry to find ways to improve its management methods as soon as possible, reduce redundant personnel (or have redundant personnel participate in production), improve labor-management relations, eliminate concerns, increase production funds, and actively open up the market. Recently, individual factories, such as Jingwei and Hengdecheng, have overcome some difficulties by improving their management methods through labor-management consultation. Although this is only the beginning, it is very clear that this is the road that the entire weaving and dyeing industry should take in order to overcome difficulties and tide over the difficulties. Regarding the problems of the weaving and dyeing industry itself, some have been published in newspapers recently, so we will not talk much about them here, but only talk about several problems that have occurred in the Flower Yarn and Cloth Company in supporting the production of the weaving and dyeing industry and in the relationship between the public and private sectors.
　　The China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the North China Regional Company, and the Beijing Municipal Branch have all worked hard to support the production of the weaving and dyeing industry and have made certain achievements, which has largely solved the production and sales problems of the weaving and dyeing industry. From April to December 1949, the Beijing branch alone supported 1,939 looms, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total number of looms in the Beijing weaving and dyeing industry, and supplied more than 161,500 bundles of cotton yarn, recovering 321,000 pieces of various cotton cloths. Due to the high cost and low quality of processed cloth, the company encountered some difficulties in promoting these cloths. In 1949, the branch company lost a total of 440,000 catties of millet in order to maintain processing. This was a great help to the weaving and dyeing industry in Beijing. However, the company's understanding of the policy of supporting production was insufficient, and individual cadres still had a purely profit-making view, so they lacked active measures to support production. Although the Beijing branch conducted a review of these issues at the managers' and section chiefs' joint meeting in March, these shortcomings have not been completely overcome. Therefore, many difficulties still arise in the work. The first is the lack of thorough and systematic consideration of the processing production plan. Therefore, some of the decisions made are completely unworkable, and the plan fails to adapt to the objective situation at that time and place. Therefore, the phenomenon of the company's orders changing frequently is very serious. For example, the North China Regional Company's instructions on the Beijing branch's processing and production plan for 1950 have been changed repeatedly. In January, it stipulated that the Beijing branch should receive 357,000 pieces of various processed cloths (converted into "August 1st" plain cloth) throughout the year; in February, it was changed to 288,000 pieces throughout the year; in February, it was decided that 355,872 pieces should be received in ten months (March to December); in April, it was changed to 24,000 pieces per month; in May, it was changed to 17,000 pieces per month. Such repeated changes are certainly due to changes in the national economic situation and the total amount of yarn and cloth production and sales, but the policy and methods of supporting production have to be changed again and again. For example, the company's initial policy was: "Develop electric looms and maintain manual looms." Then it was: "Universally mobilize all electric and manual looms in the city." (However, according to Zhao Mulin, the head of the finished product sales section of the branch company, "It is impossible to complete the task assigned by the superiors even if all the machines in the city are mobilized.") Now it has been changed to "Maintain electric looms and stop manual looms." This affects the specific policy of supporting production, and it cannot but be a vigorous mobilization for a while and a reduction in operations for a while, making many private factories that accept processing confused and generally expressing dissatisfaction.
　　The biggest impact on production sentiment is that the company cannot strictly implement the contract. For example, the supply of yarn is not timely, and the receipt of goods is not fixed, which causes factories to suffer losses due to waiting for shafts (i.e., suspension of work waiting for materials). Although the North China Regional Company should be directly responsible for these phenomena, it also shows that the branch company lacks planning, initiative, and enthusiasm. For example, after the establishment of the Trade Treasury, the processing fees issued by the branch company to the processing factories were changed to yarn instead of money. However, the list price of the branch company's cotton yarn was higher than the market price. When processing fees are issued, they are converted according to the company's higher list price, but the factory's expenses need to be paid in cash. This forces the processing factories to take the received yarn to the market and sell it at a lower market price. This makes these factories suffer a loss first. In addition, they have to pay a business tax when selling goods, and the processing factories have to suffer another loss. As a result, each bundle of yarn sometimes loses about 30,000 yuan. Although using yarn instead of money is a necessary method in implementing unified financial and economic measures, it is unreasonable to cause such losses to processing factories in the process of implementation. This problem dragged on for a long time. Although this method was changed later, the processing households have already suffered a lot. The existence of phenomena such as non-compliance with contracts and mechanical execution of orders has increased the difficulties of processing households, and thus seriously hinders the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests.
　　There are also some shortcomings in the branch company's inspection of the quality of finished products and calculation of processing profits. For example, there is no fixed standard for the quality inspection when receiving goods. It is sometimes wide and sometimes strict, depending on the sales situation. Many workers reflected: "We can't figure out what kind of 'temper' the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has, what kind of weaving is considered合格呢?" This shortcoming is mainly because the processing contract is not specific and detailed enough. These contracts only stipulate the length, width, and number of warp and weft threads of the cloth, but the quality standards of the cloth are actually more than these. For example, uneven cloth surface, frayed cloth edges, and snagging should all be substandard. However, these standards are not clearly stated in the contract, but they are proposed in the implementation. Therefore, disputes often arise between the two parties, and the relationship between the public and private sectors is not good. In terms of cost calculation, the company has not yet stipulated a reasonable processing profit standard. The calculation of processing profits is sometimes high and sometimes low, showing a chaotic phenomenon. For example, in June 1949, each manual loom could get a net profit of 416 catties of millet for weaving eight-zhang striped cloth; by September, each manual loom's net profit for weaving 41-pound military cloth was reduced to 35 catties of millet. (Note: The company gives a processing fee of 36 catties of millet per piece of eight-zhang striped cloth; the processing fee for 41-pound military cloth is 37 catties of millet per piece. Each machine can produce 26 pieces of eight-zhang striped cloth per month, while only 15 pieces of military cloth can be produced.) The former profit is too high, and the latter profit is relatively low. In February 1950, when changing to weaving "23" plain cloth, the processing fee was 44 catties of millet per piece. According to the Beijing branch's cost calculation: each manual loom can get a net profit of 4 catties of millet per piece, and each electric loom can get a net profit of 15.67 catties of millet per piece. However, according to the actual consumption of factories investigated by the Tenth District Trade Union, each manual loom loses 8.4 catties of millet per piece, and each electric loom loses 2.6 catties of millet per piece. Although this calculation cannot be said to be completely accurate, the large difference between the two shows that the branch company's cost calculation is worth re-studying.
　　In addition, some receiving personnel do not have enough spirit of serving the masses when accepting finished products. For example, when inspecting a factory's cloth, they did not finish the inspection, and the bell rang for the end of work, so they stopped inspecting. The remaining pieces of cloth would not take much time to finish the inspection, so as to avoid the factory sending people again the next day, wasting manpower and material resources. However, some inspectors ignored the requests of the senders and went to play table tennis. Therefore, the processing households reflected that the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company is a "government-run commercial organization." This is a manifestation of the company's leading cadres' insufficient education of cadres.
　　Of course, there are many cases of private factories that undertake processing cutting corners and deceiving the company. For example, when weaving "August 1st" plain cloth, the original stipulation was 38 shuttles, but factories such as Buxin and Sanyi only used 37 shuttles. The products of factories such as Zhao Futang and Zhou Qingshan are not long enough. Some even use inferior Shanghai yarn to replace good Tianjin yarn. Such behaviors of seeking illegal profits and deceiving the company have also caused the company to distrust the processing households. Therefore, to improve the relationship between the public and private sectors, both parties must work hard to improve.
　　In the future, in supporting the production of the weaving and dyeing industry, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company should first pay attention to the relationship between the public and private sectors; at the same time, it must combine the work of supporting production with the work of guiding production. We should strive to reduce costs and improve quality according to production conditions, and make each factory appropriately divide the work. Small factories that voluntarily implement joint operations can do so to facilitate guidance. Both parties should earnestly fulfill the contracts that have been signed. The specifications and quality of finished products should also be specifically stipulated according to the needs of the market. If the regulations are not appropriate, they can be modified next time, but the goods must be received in accordance with the regulations at the time. Production plans must be based on the whole year, and the processing and production plan for the whole year should not be changed repeatedly due to temporary sales or slow sales. If these principles can be realized, it will not only be conducive to the weaving and dyeing industry to overcome difficulties and develop production, but also conducive to the recovery and development of the entire national economy.

　　从北京花纱布分公司扶植织染业生产中
    看到公私关系的一些问题
    王敬
    今年三月以后，物价稳定，投机买卖大大减少。以投机为目的而囤积的布匹、大量上市，以致棉布市价低于生产成本，增加了织染业在生产中的暂时困难。这个情况，在北京和在其他大城市基本相同。
    一年来，北京的织染业，一般的并没有积极地、主动地尽力改善经营，因此成品的质量低而成本高。中国花纱布公司北京分公司过去在扶植织染业的生产上，缺乏计划性，个别的干部“为生产服务”的观点不够明确，公私关系未处理好，也影响了织染业的生产。要克服织染业目前的困难，主要的，应该是织染业自己想办法，尽快地改善经营方法，裁减冗员（或使冗员参加生产），搞好劳资关系，去掉顾虑，增加生产资金，并主动地打开市场。最近已有个别工厂，如经纬、恒德成等，经过劳资协商，改善了经营方法，克服了一些困难。虽然这还只是开始，但这是整个织染业为了克服困难、渡过难关所应走的道路，则十分明显。关于织染业本身的问题，最近报纸上曾陆续刊载过一些，我们在这里不多谈，只谈花纱布公司在扶植织染业的生产和在公私关系上所发生的几个问题。
    中国花纱布公司、华北区公司和北京市分公司都曾努力扶植了织染业的生产，做出了一定成绩，使织染业的产销问题大部分得到了解决。从一九四九年四月到十二月，仅就北京分公司来说，前后共扶植了织机一千九百三十九台，占北京织染业总机数的百分之七十强，共供给棉纱十六万一千五百余捆，收回各种棉布三十二万一千匹。由于加工布的成本高、质量低，在推销这些布匹的时候，公司遇到了一些困难。该分公司在一九四九年中，为了维持加工，共赔损了四十四万斤小米。这对于北京织染业是一个不小的帮助。但该公司对于扶植生产的方针还认识不足，个别干部还有单纯营利观点，因此在扶植生产上还缺乏积极的办法。虽然北京分公司在三月份经理股长联席会上，对于这些问题曾有检讨，但是这种缺点仍未彻底克服。因此，在工作上仍然发生了许多困难。首先是对于加工生产计划缺乏周详的系统的考虑。因此所作决定中，有些完全行不通，计划未能适应当时当地的客观情况。所以该公司计划朝令夕改的现象很严重。例如华北区公司指示北京分公司一九五○年的加工生产计划就曾屡次变更。一月份规定北京分公司全年应收各种加工布匹（折成“八一”白布）三十五万七千匹；二月份改为全年二十八万八千匹；二月份又决定十个月（三月至十二月）共应收三十五万五千八百七十二匹；四月份又改为每月收二万四千匹；五月份又改为每月收一万七千匹。这样屡次的改变，固然是由于全国经济形势和纱布产销总量的情况改变了，但是，生产计划一再变更，扶植生产的方针和办法，也就不能不一改再改，例如该公司最初的方针是：“发展电力机、维持人力机”。继而是：“普遍发动全市所有电力、人力机”。（但据分公司成品推销科长赵木林说：“把全市机器都发动起来，也完成不了上级所提出的任务。”）现在又改为“维持电力机，停止人力机”。这就影响到扶植生产的具体方针，不能不是一会儿大力发动，一会儿缩小经营，使许多接受加工的私营工厂，摸不着头脑，普遍地表示不满。
    影响生产情绪最大的是公司不能严格地执行合同。如供纱不及时，收货不固定，使工厂为了等轴（即停工待料）而遭受损失。造成这些现象的直接负责者，虽应当是华北区公司，但是也说明分公司的计划性、主动性和积极性不够。又如贸易金库建立之后，分公司发给加工工厂的加工费，改为以纱代款。而分公司棉纱的牌价却高于市价。发给加工费时，按公司较高的牌价折合，工厂的开支却需要现款支付。这就使加工工厂不能不把领来的纱拿到市场上按较低的市价出售。这样就使这些工厂先吃了一次亏。再加上售货时还须缴纳一次行商税，加工工厂又要吃一次亏。结果，每捆纱有时要亏三万元左右。虽然以纱代款，是实行财经统一措施中应有办法，但是在执行过程中，使加工工厂遭受这样的损失，是不合理的。这个问题拖延了很久。到后来这个办法虽然改变了，但加工户已经吃亏不小了。像这一类不遵守合同和机械地执行命令等现象的存在，都增加了加工户的困难，因而也就严重地妨害了公私兼顾的原则。
    分公司检查成品质量和计算加工利润时也存在着一些缺点。例如收货时对质量的检查，就没有一定的标准。随着销路情况的变化，时而宽、时而严。许多工人反映：“我们摸不清花纱布公司的‘脾气’究竟织得啥样才算合格呢？”这个缺点，主要是因为加工合同订得不具体、不详细。这些合同上只规定了布的长度、宽度和经纬线数，但布匹的质量标准，实际上并不止这些。比如，布面不平、布边发毛、挑丝等等，都应该是不合标准的。可是，合同上并没有明白定出这些标准，而在执行中却提出这些标准来。因此常引起双方的争执，公私关系也就弄得不好了。在成本计算方面，公司方面至今还没有规定出一个合理的加工利润标准。计算加工利润时，有的多，有的少，表现了一种混乱现象。比如，一九四九年六月份，每台人力机，织八丈条布，可得纯利四百十六斤小米；到九月份每台人力机，织四十一磅军布，纯利却降到三十五斤小米。（按：公司给予八丈条布的加工费是每匹三十六斤小米；给予四十一磅军布的加工费是每匹三十七斤小米。每台机子每月可产八丈条布二十六匹，军布则仅十五匹。）前者利润太高，后者利润又较低。到一九五○年二月份改织“二三”白布，每匹给加工费四十四斤小米。按北京分公司的成本计算：人力机每匹可得纯利四斤小米，电力机每匹可得纯利一五·六七斤小米。但据十区工会调查工厂实际消耗，则人力机每匹亏八·四斤小米，电力机每匹亏二·六斤小米。这个计算，虽不能肯定完全精确，但从两者相差之远，可以看出分公司的成本计算，是值得重新研究的。
    此外，有些收货人员在验收成品时，为群众服务的精神也有不够的地方。例如，检验某厂的布匹，没有验完，下班铃响了，他们就不验了。剩下的几匹布，本来用不了很多时间，就可全部验完，免得这家工厂第二天又派人来一次，耗费人力物力。但是有些验货人员毫不理睬送货人的央求，迳去打乒乓球了。因此，加工户反映：花纱布公司是“官办的商业机关”。这是公司的领导干部对干部教育不够的表现。
    当然，在承受加工的私营工厂方面，偷工减料、欺骗公司的情形也很多。例如，织“八一”白布，原规定三十八杼，而补新、三义等工厂却只用了三十七杼。赵福堂、周庆善等工厂的产品，长度不够。还有的竟用上海的劣等纱顶替天津的好纱。这样一类贪图非法利润，欺骗公司的行为，也造成了公司对加工户的不信任。因此，要搞好公私关系，必须公私双方努力改进。
    今后花纱布公司在扶植织染业生产中，首先应注意公私关系；同时，必须把扶植生产的工作和指导生产的工作结合起来。应该根据生产条件，努力减低成本，提高质量，并使各工厂适当分工。小工厂自愿实行联营者可以联营，以便于指导。对已订立的合同，双方都应切实履行。对于成品的规格、质量也应当根据市场的需要作具体的规定。规定不合适，下次再加修改，却不可不依照当时的规定收货。生产计划须从全年着眼，不应因一时畅销与滞销而一再变更全年加工生产的计划。这些原则如能实现，就不但有利于织染业克服困难，发展生产；而且对于整个国民经济的恢复与发展也是有利的。
