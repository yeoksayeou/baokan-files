Troops stationed in Wuhan enthusiastically study culture
　A certain division's 3,000 illiterate soldiers now recognize more than 300 characters
　Learning is linked to practical life, and soldiers' confidence in progress is enhanced
　[Our Wuhan dispatch] The People's Liberation Army units stationed in Wuhan have launched a wave of cultural learning, achieving great results in recent months. For example, in the Guards Regiment directly under the Fourth Field Army, the number of people who originally knew less than 200 characters was 598, but now there are only 44. In a certain division, the original number of illiterate people was 3,899, but now only over 300 know less than 300 characters. The number of people in that division who could read the "Changjiang Daily" has increased from 1,267 to 1,851, and the number who can read "Soldier's Life" has increased from 1,676 to 2,496.
　The improvement of soldiers' cultural level has directly enhanced work efficiency. For example, it is generally no longer difficult to look at badges and symbols, and read documents and official letters while on guard duty. After the upsurge of learning was launched, the life of the troops became more active, and the phenomenon of "attrition" was thus eliminated or reduced. Some soldiers who previously thought they were "roughnecks with no future" have established confidence in their progress through learning. Some backward ideas such as homesickness, wife-sickness, and the desire for enjoyment have also been clarified. Everyone feels that with the victory of the revolution, they also have a future. Many people reflected: "Cultural learning is like a key that opens our minds!"
　When carrying out the cultural learning movement, all units generally first conducted ideological mobilization, explaining that to build a national defense army and master modern science and technology, it is first necessary to improve culture; and patiently persuading some soldiers who are unwilling to learn or have no confidence in learning, in order to eliminate dead corners in learning. Some also seized on actual examples to carry out education. For example, when it was discovered that a soldier could not read his own family letter, he was used as an example to inspire everyone to pay attention to learning. In teaching, attention was paid to the principle of long-term planning, from the shallow to the deep. The content of learning focuses first on Chinese; those with a relatively basic level of culture are then introduced to natural science, geography, and history. In Chinese teaching, the method of "learning and application in unison" is mainly adopted. For example, in the Guards Regiment of the Fourth Field Army, the literacy class first learns words and sentences related to daily life and work, such as "hand," "foot," "gun," "borrowing slip," and "leave slip." Those with a higher level of culture learn applied writing, such as notes, diaries, passes, reports, and summaries. Some troops also adopted many effective teaching methods, such as paying attention to linking single characters into words and sentences; breaking down complex characters into several characters to teach; and the Guards Regiment also created a "practice method," such as when Class A learns to write a borrowing certificate, they write a borrowing certificate to borrow something from another class, and everyone is very happy after borrowing it. A certain division also selected and taught some popular and interesting news and literary works from newspapers and periodicals in order to improve the reading ability of soldiers who already have a considerable cultural foundation; for soldiers with a poor cultural level, comrades in the Party organization with a high cultural level were specifically assigned to be responsible for helping them learn. A certain regiment also put forward the slogan "Everyone is a teacher, everywhere is a classroom," and launched a mutual teaching and learning movement. In addition, all units have also established systems such as testing, roll call, make-up classes, reports, and publishing of results, which have played a role in promoting and guaranteeing learning.
　At present, a wave of learning has formed in all units. During rest time, soldiers can be seen everywhere burying their heads in hard work, and there are no idlers in the barracks. Some soldiers use wooden sticks and fingers to draw characters on the ground when they don't have paper and pens. Cooks and communicators also seize the time to study. Soldiers also save their pocket money to buy stationery. For example, the Guards Regiment of the Fourth Field Army has successively bought 1,956 fountain pens, 700 pencils, and a large number of paper and ink; before November last year, soldiers in a certain division only had 4,312 fountain pens, but by January this year, the number had increased to 8,754.

　　驻武汉部队热烈学文化
　  某师三千文盲现在都识三百多字       
    学习联系实际生活战士前进信心增强
    【本报武汉讯】驻武汉的人民解放军各部队，展开了文化学习的热潮，数月来获得很大的成绩。如第四野战军直属警卫团原来识字二百以下的有五百九十八人，现在只有四十四人了。某师不识字的原有三千八百九十九人，现在识字三百以下的仅有三百余人了。该师原来只有一千二百六十七人能读《长江日报》，现已增至一千八百五十一人，能读《战士生活》的则已由一千六百七十六人增至二千四百九十六人。
    战士文化程度的提高，直接增强了工作效能，如站岗时看证章、符号，读文件、公函等，一般均已不感困难。学习热潮开展之后，部队生活也活跃起来，“减员”现象从而消灭或减少了。一部分过去认为“大老粗没前途”的战士，在学习中树立了前进的信心。一些想家、想老婆、贪图享受等落后意识也澄清了。大家感到革命胜利，自己也有前途了。许多人反映：“文化学习好像一把钥匙，这一下可把咱们的脑门开开啦！”
    各部在开展文化学习运动时，一般首先进行了思想动员，说明建立国防军，掌握现代科学技术，首先必须提高文化；并耐心地说服某些不愿学习或对学习没有信心的战士，以消灭学习的死角。有的并抓住实际事例来进行教育，如发现战士接了家信不能自己看时，就以他为例子来启发大家重视学习。在教学中，注意了长期打算的方针，由浅入深。学习内容首先是着重国文；文化程度较有基础的则加入自然科学和地理、历史等。国文教学中主要采取“学用一致”的方法。如四野警卫团在识字课上，首先学习与日常生活与工作有关的字句：如“手”、“足”、“枪”、“借物条”、“请假条”等。文化程度高一点的则学习应用文，如便条、日记、通行证、报告、总结等。有的部队还采用了许多有效的教学方法，如注意把单字联成词句；把复杂的字分解为几个字教；警卫团并创造“演习法”，如甲班学会了写借物证，就写借物证向别班借东西，借来后大家都很高兴。某师并选授一部分报纸、刊物上的通俗的、有趣的消息和文艺作品，以提高已有相当文化基础的战士的阅读能力；对文化程度较差的战士，则从党内组织文化程度高的同志，具体分工，负责帮助他们学习。某团并提出了“人人是先生，处处是学堂”的口号，展开了互教互学运动。此外，各部还建立了测验、点名、补课、汇报、公布成绩等制度，在学习中起了推动和保证的作用。
    目前，各部学习已形成热潮。在休息时间，到处可以见到战士们在埋头用功，营房里没有闲人。有的战士在没有纸笔时，就用木棒、手指在地上画字。炊事员、通讯员们也抓紧时间学习。战士们并省下零用钱添购文具，如四野警卫团先后买了一千九百五十六支钢笔，七百支铅笔和大批纸张墨水等；某师去年十一月以前，战士们只有钢笔四千三百一十二支，今年一月已增加到八千七百五十四支。
