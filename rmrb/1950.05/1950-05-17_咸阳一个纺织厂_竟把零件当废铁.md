　　A Textile Factory in Xianyang

　　Actually Treated Parts as Scrap Metal
    In March, the foundry department of the repair shop of the Northwest People's Textile Construction Company's First Textile Factory in Xianyang, a public enterprise in Shaanxi, requested the materials department to purchase 4,000 catties of scrap iron for casting machine parts. Zhang Yimin, the head of the materials department, asked the deputy factory director Zhang Zhongshu for instructions. The deputy factory director told him to discuss it with Wang Feibiao, the director of the security department. However, Zhang Yimin did not consult with Wang Feibiao at all and ordered clerk Wang Wenying to send 1,174 finished parts from the warehouse to the foundry as scrap iron. At that time, Zheng Guoquan and other engineers in the repair shop clearly knew that these were all good parts, but they thought, "The head of the materials department is the commander, and we are the gunners. As long as the commander gives an order, what do we care!" (This is what Zheng said during his subsequent ideological self-criticism.) So they threw them into the furnace to melt. It is estimated that the loss amounted to more than RMB 8.7 million.

    This is a waste incident that cannot be ignored, indicating that the leadership of the factory has a serious bureaucratic attitude of irresponsibility towards the people's property. It is hoped that the relevant departments will pay serious attention to it.

　　咸阳一个纺织厂
　　竟把零件当废铁编辑同志：
    陕西咸阳公营的西北人民纺织建设公司第一纺织厂修械间翻砂部，在三月间，为了配铸机器零件，要求料品科购买废铁四千斤。料品科长张逸民请示副厂长张仲书，副厂长叫他与保全部主任王飞彪商量。但张逸民根本未与王飞彪谈，即叫办事员王文英将库房一千一百七十四件成品当作废铁，送给修械间翻砂。当时修械间工务员郑国权等明知这些都是好好的零件，但认为“料品科长是司令官，咱们是炮手，只要司令官有命令，管他干吗！”（这是郑以后进行思想检讨时说出来的）即把它们投到化铁炉里熔化。据估计，这次损失约达人民币八百七十余万元。
    这是一件不容忽视的浪费事件，说明了该厂的领导严重存在着对人民财产不负责任的官僚主义。希望有关部门严重注意。
