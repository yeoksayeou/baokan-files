Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 30th. Before the opening of the All-German Democratic Youth Congress, the Western occupation authorities and the Bonn puppet government did their best to hinder this grand demonstration. Within the Saar region and the various states of Germany, they refused to issue inter-zonal passes necessary for West German young peace fighters to legally cross zonal boundaries under various pretexts. When the youth therefore crossed the border on their own on a large scale, many were arrested. In areas such as Hamburg and Braunschweig, the authorities even offered rewards for the capture of members of the Free German Youth League. The West Berlin occupation authorities and their German lackeys not only set up concentration camps for "disruptors of order," but also dispatched more police to the zonal borders to arrest young people wearing blue shirts who crossed the zonal boundaries.

However, all the efforts of the Western occupation authorities and their German followers have proven ineffective. Democratic youth from all over Germany, with the support of the broad masses of the people, have come to Berlin.

　　西德占领当局拒发通行证
    阻止青年参加大会       
    许多青年被迫越界遭逮捕
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社柏林消息：在全德民主青年大会开幕之前，西方占领当局及波恩傀儡政府曾尽力阻碍这一盛大的示威。在萨尔及德国各州境内，他们在各种借口下拒绝发给西德青年和平战士以合法通过区界所必需的区际通行证。当青年们因此大规模自行越界时，有许多人被捕。在汉堡及不伦瑞克市等地区，当局甚至悬赏捉拿自由德国青年联盟的盟员。西柏林占领当局及其德国走狗不仅设立了“破坏秩序者”的集中营，而且更在区界加派警察，捉拿穿着蓝衫越过区界的青年。
    但是，西方占领当局及其德国扈从的一切努力，都已证明无效。全德国的民主青年在广大人民的支持下，都来到了柏林。
