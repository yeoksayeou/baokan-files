Tianjin Railway Bureau's Botouzhen Work Zone Foreman
Jiang Zhenyuan Creates "Crawling Corrector"

　　Jiang Zhenyuan, foreman of Botouzhen Work Zone, Dexian Engineering Section, Tianjin Railway Bureau, created a "rail crawling corrector," which increased the work efficiency of correcting crawling in railway engineering by more than four times. The crawler corrector has a simple structure and is easy to manufacture. The test results show that only three people are needed to do the work of fifteen people in the past when correcting crawling, and it does not damage the rail fittings or hinder the train operation. In addition to paying all the experimental expenses, the Tianjin Railway Bureau awarded Jiang Zhenyuan a major merit, a two-level salary increase, and a bonus of 1,000 work-wage points (approximately 2 million RMB).

　　Crawling is a phenomenon in which the steel rail often moves back and forth, changing its normal position due to the vibration of train wheels and the increase or decrease of train speed. Rail crawling sometimes causes the expansion joints between two rails to tighten, and in severe cases, even makes the rails bow-shaped, which can cause accidents. Therefore, in the past, railway engineering departments often spent a lot of effort to correct crawling.

### 天津铁路局泊头镇工区领工员  姜振元创造“爬行矫正器”

    姜振元创造“爬行矫正器”
    天津铁路局德县工务段泊头镇工区领工员姜振元创造了“钢轨爬行矫正器”，使铁路工务上矫正爬行的工作效率提高了四倍多。该项爬行矫正器构造较简单，制造也很容易。试验结果：矫正爬行时只需要三个人就能做过去十五个人的工作，而且不损钢轨配件，也不妨碍行车。天津铁路局对该项创造除支付了全部试验费用外，并给姜振元记大功一次，晋薪二级，奖金一千工薪分（约合人民币二百余万元）。
    爬行是钢轨由于火车车轮震动及火车增减速度等原因而时常发生的一种前后移动改变正常位置的现象。钢轨爬行，有时使两根钢轨间预备膨胀的接头缝顶紧，严重时甚至使钢轨成为弓形，以致造成事故。因此过去铁路工务部门经常花费很大力量来矫正爬行。
