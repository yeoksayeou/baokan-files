　　苏联欧洲部分完成植林计划
    植林总面积为去年同期的三倍半
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：今年春季，苏联欧洲部分草原区和森林草原区的集体农场，都完成了种植森林防护带的全年计划。植林总面积为去年春季的三倍半。乌克兰集体农场的植林工作已超过计划百分之二十三。
    有二十万零八千公顷的森林，是根据李森科的簇种法种植的。在其余土地上种植了约十五亿株树与灌木。在乌克兰、北高加索、伏尔加河沿岸各州及克里米亚等地，新种植的防护林带中，有几百万株苹果、梨、杏、樱桃等类果树。在契卡洛夫州的许多集体农场，已经用红醋栗灌木将防护林带连接起来。
    建立集体农场的森林苗圃的全年计划，已被超过了三分之一。
