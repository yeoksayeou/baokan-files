Lingshou County Guanzhuang Village "Correction of Deviations" is Biased
Hope the Hebei Provincial Government Will Thoroughly Investigate

Editor Comrade:
	I am from Guanzhuang Village, Third District, Lingshou County, Hebei Province. Before the land reform, I had no house to live in and borrowed a vacant courtyard from Hao Wubao (landlord). After the land reform, I still borrowed his, and I was very angry with him. To explain this problem, I have to lengthen the story a bit. Before the "July 7th" Incident, my family was a middle peasant. In the year of the incident, my father and his brother separated. My father's side had a large population (thirteen people at that time), so we became poor peasants, renting a lot of land from others. After the separation, my father's family did not get a house, only some trees, to prepare for building a house later. But after the incident, the trees were gone, and the house was not built. Therefore, the family life became worse day by day. In 1940, I separated from my brother. I had eight people on my side, and my brother had two. So I became even poorer, and it was difficult to maintain life even with bran and wild vegetables every year. By 1943, I finally found a house, which was a vacant courtyard borrowed from Hao Wubao (landlord). It happened that in this year, my family suffered from the germs spread by the enemy in the local area, and five members of my family died of illness, including my eldest son, two daughters-in-law, and my parents. The following year, my second son also sacrificed while carrying out anti-Japanese work in the enemy area. Now I have three young sons left, who have long joined the People's Liberation Army. His wife works locally. There are only me and my old partner at home. During the land reform in the winter of 1947, all of Hao Wubao's property was confiscated. When the houses were distributed in the spring of the following year, Wang Jide (now the district chief of the First District of Lingshou), from the work team, was in charge of the village. He decided to give me half of Hao Wubao's vacant courtyard, and this was also filled in when filling out the land certificate. In April, after the work team left, the district came again for a "correction of deviations," and returned all the houses I had been allocated to Hao Wubao. For this matter, I ran to the district, and the district pushed it back to the village. Since the work team left, the power in the village has been controlled by the cadre Hao Zhengye alone. Hao Zhengye and Hao Wubao are close relatives. This year, during the New Year, Hao Zhengye, the village farmers' association director, and Hao Wubao, like debt collectors on the thirtieth night of the lunar year, forced me to write an IOU to Hao Wubao. At that time, I felt really uncomfortable, and tears kept streaming down my face. I didn't write them an IOU. After they left, I lay on the bed and cried for a long time. Now Hao Wubao has moved into this courtyard, and his son Hao Nan constantly says: "The soldiers (referring to the People's Liberation Army) have lost their conscience and will not die well." Hao Wubao's wife scolds people all day long. This kind of humiliation is really unbearable, and it really makes people feel desperate. The villagers are talking about this matter and are indignant on my behalf. Some people say: "People have lived there for several years, how can they be driven away..." Others say: "People are family members of anti-Japanese soldiers, people died on the front line, and the third son is still in the army. What is his family (referring to Hao Wubao)? When recruiting soldiers, two and a half of his three sons ran away, and he was considered a person then!" Comrades! I won't write any more, the more I write, the longer it gets, and the more uncomfortable I feel. This matter is even more uncomfortable than when my second son sacrificed! At that time, I was not overly sad, I just knew that he died with value, died for the people, died for the poor to turn over! Died gloriously. Comrades! Let everyone judge whether I should be allocated a house to live in? The Land Law Outline stipulates that landlords and rich peasants still have a share, don't I have a share? Can't I be allocated a house to live in? Everything said above is not a lie, but the truth has not been clearly stated. I hope the higher authorities will send someone to investigate. With revolutionary greetings.

### 灵寿县官庄村“纠偏”有偏向　望河北省府彻查

　　灵寿县官庄村“纠偏”有偏向
　　望河北省府彻查编辑同志：
    我是河北省灵寿县三区官庄村人，在土地改革前没有房子住，借住本村郝五保（地主成份）闲院一所。土地改革后，我仍是借住他的，很受他的气。为了说明这个问题，我要把话拉长一些。在“七七”事变前，我家是个中农。到事变那年，我父亲弟兄俩个分了家。我父亲这里人口多（当时有十三口人），便变成了贫农，租种着人家不少的地。这次分家，我父亲一家没有分下房子，只分了一部分树，准备以后盖房子。但事变后，树也光了，房子也没盖成。因此家庭生活一天不如一天。到一九四○年我又与我兄弟分了家。我这边有八口人，我兄弟有两口人。这样我就更穷了，每年吃糠咽菜还难维持生活。到一九四三年时，我算是找到了一所房子，就是借郝五保（地主成份）一所闲院住。恰在这年，我家因敌人在当地散布病菌，一家光害病死的有大小子、两个儿媳妇以及父母亲共五口。到第二年时我二小子因在敌区进行抗日工作也牺牲了。现在丢下的三小子，他早就参加了解放军。他媳妇在地方上工作。家中只有我和老伴。在一九四七年冬天土地改革时，郝五保全部家产曾被没收。到第二年春天分房时，由工作组王积德（现在灵寿一区当区长）在该村负责。确定把郝五保的这所闲院分给我一半，并且在填土地证时也是这样填的。到四月间，工作组走后，区里又来了一次“纠偏”，把我已分得的房子又全部退给郝五保了。为这事我曾跑到区里，区里又推到村里。自工作组走后，村里的权力又都掌握在干部郝正业一人手里。郝正业与郝五保他们是近家子。到今年过年的时候，郝正业和村农会主任，还有郝五保，象三十晚上逼账一样，硬要我给郝五保写借据。当时我的心里实在有些难受，眼泪不住的往外流，没有给他们写借据。他们走后，我躺在炕上哭了半天。现在郝五保已搬到这个院里住，他小子郝南看成天说：“当兵的（指解放军）都丧了良心，都得不到好死。”郝五保他媳妇整天指猪骂狗。这种窝囊气，实在难以忍受，真叫人走头无路。村里人们对这事情都纷纷议论，代抱不平。有人说：“人家住了好几年了，那还能撵走人家……。”又有的说：“人家是抗日家属，人都死在前线上，三小子现在还在军队上。他家（指郝五保）是什么？扩兵的时候，三个小子跑了两个半，那时他倒算人啦！”同志们！我不往下写了，越写越长，越难受。这事真比我二小子牺牲那时还难受呢！那时我并没有过分悲伤过，就知道他是死的有价值，是为人民死，为咱穷人翻身死！死得光荣。同志们！让大家评一评我是不是应该分到房子住？土地法大纲规定，地主富农还有一份，难道就没有我的份吗？就不能分给我一间房子住吗？以上所说，没有一字瞎话，只是实话还没说清，望上级派人调查。致以革命敬礼
