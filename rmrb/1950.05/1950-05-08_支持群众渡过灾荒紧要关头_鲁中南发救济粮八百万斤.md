　　Supporting the Masses Through the Critical Period of Famine
    Central and Southern Shandong Distributes Eight Million Jin of Relief Grain
    [News from Central and Southern Shandong] To support the masses through the famine, the Central and Southern Shandong Administrative Office distributed 8,620,000 jin of relief grain on April 17th. This will play a decisive role in ensuring that "not an acre of land is left uncultivated and not a single person starves to death" during the upcoming forty-day period between harvests.

    While distributing the relief grain, the Administrative Office issued instructions requiring leaders at all levels to carry out this work conscientiously and earnestly, and to combine the distribution of relief grain with the organization of mass production. The Administrative Office also closely monitored the principle of prioritized use and one-time distribution based on the severity of the disaster in various regions. The Nishan Special District, which was severely affected, was allocated 2.2 million jin, and the Taixi Special District also received 2.2 million jin. Jibei County (newly established, north of Jining) in the Nishan Special District alone received 410,000 jin, and Mengshan County (newly established) in the Yimeng Special District received 650,000 jin. Areas with lighter disaster conditions, such as the Taishan Special District, received 400,000 jin. In terms of timing, it was required that the grain be distributed to the masses by the end of April, with no retention or misappropriation by governments at any level, so as to truly support the lives and production of disaster victims. Pingyi County (newly established) distributed 320,000 jin of grain this time, and the masses were very grateful. Some people said, "When we handed in public grain, we carried it with a cloth bundle, but the government gave it to us, and we carried it with a shoulder pole." The masses knew from their own calculations that the grain the government gave them (including relief, preferential treatment for military families, and work-for-relief) was more than the public grain they had paid. Cadres in Mengshan County and Jibei County also believed that this time it could truly solve the problem. To help solve the difficulties in grain transportation, the Shandong Provincial Government specially allowed the use of wheat grain to replace coarse grain on a one-to-one basis in areas without coarse grain, to ensure that it was distributed to disaster victims in a timely and rapid manner. At the same time, the bank provided 700,000 jin of seed grain loans to solve the seed difficulties of the masses in spring planting.

　　支持群众渡过灾荒紧要关头
    鲁中南发救济粮八百万斤
    【鲁中南讯】山东鲁中南行署为了支持群众渡过灾荒，于四月十七日发下救济粮八百六十二万斤。对今后四十天青黄不接时期“不荒一亩地，不饿死一口人”将起决定的作用。
    该行署在发放救济粮同时，发出指示，要求各级领导切实认真作这工作，并把发放救济粮与组织群众生产结合起来。行署并根据各地灾情紧紧掌握了重点使用、一次发放的原则，灾情严重之尼山专区分配了二百二十万斤；泰西专区二百二十万斤。尼山专区之济北（新设县，在济宁北）一县即发放四十一万斤；沂蒙专区之蒙山县（新设县）即发放六十五万斤。而灾情轻的地区如泰山专区发放了四十万斤。在时间上要求四月底发到群众手里，不准各级政府留用、挪用，真正起到支持灾民生活生产的效果。平邑县（新设县）这次发放粮三十二万斤，群众非常感激，有的群众说：“我们交公粮时是用一个包袱包着，政府给我们的，用挑子挑着”。群众在自己算账中知道政府给他的粮食（包括救济、优待军属、以工代赈等）比缴的公粮还多。蒙山县和济北县干部也都认为这次是真能解决问题的。山东省政府为了帮助解决粮食调运的困难，特允许在没有粗粮的地区，可用麦粮一斤顶一斤发放，以保证及时迅速的发到灾民手中。银行同时贷放种子粮七十万斤，以解决群众春种中的种子困难。
