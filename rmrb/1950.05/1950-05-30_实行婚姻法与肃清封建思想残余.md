　　Implementing the Marriage Law and Eradicating the Remnants of Feudal Ideology
    An Ziwen, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee
    China's feudal forces have been overthrown politically; economically, land reform has been thoroughly completed in some areas, and will soon be carried out in others. However, the remnants of feudal ideology still exist among the broad masses of the people, and even among some of our Party members. This feudal ideology is, of course, lingering in many aspects. But in the matter of marriage, it is most obvious and prominent, and its pernicious influence is the widest. The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China is a powerful weapon against the feudal marriage system. It negates all unreasonable and barbaric marriage systems, and replaces them with a new, free and equal marriage system.
    However, the promulgation of the Marriage Law does not mean that the old marriage system will be immediately and completely overthrown, and the new marriage system will be established smoothly without hindrance. What is now before us is how to ensure the implementation of the Marriage Law. The Communist Party of China has always fought for women's liberation and a free and equal marriage system; after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, our Party Central Committee instructed that Party committees at all levels and all Party members should regard the publicity and organizational work to ensure the correct implementation of the Marriage Law as one of the current and regular important tasks. But to achieve this goal, we must first eliminate the feudal remnants in the minds of some of our Party members; otherwise, they will not be able to deeply understand the spirit and essence of the Marriage Law, and thus will not be able to resolutely and bravely put the Marriage Law into practice.
    The feudal ideas of some of our Party members and cadres are most prominently manifested in the following aspects:
    First, some male comrades despise women, believing that female comrades are generally less capable than male comrades, and are burdened with children and illnesses. They do not understand that some of the weaknesses of women are caused by physiological conditions and left over from the old society. They do not make efforts to take care of the difficulties of female comrades in many ways, nor do they patiently and systematically cultivate and promote female cadres. They even transfer some female comrades from one organ to another, pushing them back and forth, without giving them appropriate work, or even if they are given work, they rarely give them the guidance and help they deserve. Therefore, in the past twenty years of vigorous revolutionary struggle, the number of female cadres has been less than that of male cadres, and their progress has not been as fast as that of male cadres. One of the main reasons is that the Party's leading organs have not sufficiently criticized this kind of thinking, and have not provided sufficient education and assistance to female Party members.
    The idea of ​​despising women not only exists in the minds of some male comrades, but also in the minds of some female comrades. For example: why are some female cadres unwilling to do women's work at all? One reason is that their thinking despises women's work, and the other is that they feel that women's work is very difficult, and they lack the courage to fight, so they adopt a passive attitude and avoid it.
    Secondly, some comrades have incorrect marital relationships. They do not understand that the love between Communist Party members and their spouses should first be based on mutual help, mutual encouragement, and common progress in the revolutionary cause. Some male cadres are unprincipled towards their wives, treating their wives as their appendages. They forget that they and their wives have not only the relationship of husband and wife, but also the relationship of Party comrades. On the other hand, some female comrades do not pay attention to studying hard in their work and striving for progress, so that they can become good cadres of the Party who can work independently. What they pay attention to is being able to have a suitable husband so that they can rely on him. Many female comrades have gradually lost their independent working ability due to this dependence, becoming Communist Party members who do not use their minds, do not seek progress, and do not contribute to the revolution. They have also developed the narrow and backward weaknesses left over from the old society, are indifferent to the cause of the Party and the people, but pay great attention to their own trivial matters, like to gossip, are "little broadcasters," spread rumors, create unprincipled disputes, and often hinder the unity within the Party.
    Feudal ideas are also manifested in the fact that some cadres illegally and wrongly use the organizational power of the Party or the power of the People's Government organs to force Party members to divorce and marry, or interfere with the freedom of marriage of men and women; on the other hand, they also adopt an unserious and irresponsible attitude towards their own marriage problems, marrying and divorcing rashly. These errors must be eliminated before the new marriage system can be successfully established.
    The above are just some of the more prominent examples, but they are sufficient to illustrate the seriousness of the remnants of feudal ideology within our Party. The success of the construction of the new China today would be impossible without a large number of outstanding female cadres, and without the liberation of the broad masses of women who make up half of the population. Therefore, our Party members and cadres must first liquidate and overcome the feudal ideas that remain in ourselves before we can lead the people to implement the Marriage Law.

### 实行婚姻法与肃清封建思想残余

　　实行婚姻法与肃清封建思想残余
    中共中央组织部副部长  安子文
    中国的封建势力，在政治上已被打倒；在经济上，一部分地区已彻底完成土地改革，另一部分地区也将要进行土地改革。但封建思想的残余，在广大人民群众中，甚至在我们党内一部分党员中，却仍然存在着。这种封建思想，当然是残存于多方面的。但在婚姻问题上，却表现得最为明显与突出，流毒也最广。中华人民共和国婚姻法，正是反对封建婚姻制度的一个有力武器。它否定了一切不合理的、野蛮的婚姻制度，而代之以新的自由平等的婚姻制度。
    但婚姻法的颁布，不等于旧的婚姻制度就立即完全地被打垮，新的婚姻制度就顺利无阻地建立起来。现在摆在我们面前的，是如何保证婚姻法的贯彻与实行。中国共产党从来是为妇女解放和自由平等的婚姻制度而奋斗的；在婚姻法颁布以后，我党中央又指示：各级党委和全体党员，把保证婚姻法正确执行的宣传工作和组织工作，当作目前的和经常的重要工作任务之一。但是要达到这个目的，就必须首先肃清我们的一部分党员思想中的封建残余，否则，他们就不可能深刻地体会婚姻法的精神与实质，从而也不可能坚决勇敢地把婚姻法付诸实施。
    我们的一部分党员和干部中的封建思想，最突出地表现在下列几方面：
    首先表现在一部分男同志轻视妇女，认为一般女同志能力不如男同志强，又有孩子、疾病等累赘。他们不懂得妇女的某些弱点，是生理条件所造成的与旧社会所留下的。他们不去多方面照顾女同志的困难，不去耐心地、有计划地培养提拔女干部，甚至把一些女同志由这一机关送到那一机关，推来推去，不给以适当的工作，或虽然给了工作，也很少给她们应有的指导和帮助。因此，在二十几年来轰轰烈烈的革命斗争中，女干部在数量上不及男干部多，进步也不及男干部快，其主要原因之一就是党的领导机关对于这种思想的批判不够，对于女党员的教育与帮助不够。
    轻视妇女的思想，不仅在一部分男同志思想上存在着，而且在一部分女同志的思想上也是存在着的。举例说：一些女干部根本不愿作妇女工作，这是什么原因呢？一种是由于她们的思想就轻视妇女工作，另一种是感到妇女工作困难很多，而自己又缺乏斗争勇气，于是就采取消极态度和逃避的办法。
    其次，有的同志在夫妻关系上是不正确的。他们不懂得共产党员的夫妻之间的爱情应该首先建筑在革命事业中的互相帮助、互相砥砺、共同进步的基础之上。有些男干部对自己的妻子是无原则的，把妻子当作自己的附属品。他们忘记了他们和他们的妻子除去夫妻关系之外，同时还有党员同志的关系。另外一方面，也有些女同志不注意在工作中好好学习，力求进步，使自己成为党的一个能独立工作的好干部。她们所注意的是能够有一位适当的丈夫，以便有所依靠。不少女同志由于这种依赖思想而逐渐丧失了她们独立的工作能力，变成不用思想，不求进步，对革命无所贡献的共产党员，从而也发展了旧社会所留给她们的狭隘、落后的弱点，对党和人民的事业漠不关心，而对自己的生活琐事却十分重视，喜欢说闲话，“小广播”，搬弄是非，闹无原则纠纷，并因而往往妨碍党内的团结。
    封建思想还表现在某些干部非法地错误地利用党的组织力量，或人民政府机关的权力，强迫党员离婚与结婚，或干涉男女群众的婚姻自由；另一方面又表现在对自己的婚姻问题采取不严肃不负责任的态度，轻率地结婚和离婚。必须肃清这些错误，新婚姻制度才能顺利地建立起来。
    上述仅仅是一些比较显著的实例，但已足说明我们党内这种封建思想残余的严重性。今天新中国建设事业的成功，如果没有大批优秀的女干部，如果没有占人口一半的广大妇女的解放，是不可能的。因此我们的党员和干部必须首先清算与克服我们本身所残存的封建思想，然后才能领导人民贯彻婚姻法。
