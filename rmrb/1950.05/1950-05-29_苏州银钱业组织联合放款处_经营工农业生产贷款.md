　　Suzhou Banking and Financial Industry Organizations Establish Joint Lending Office to Operate Industrial and Agricultural Production Loans

　　[This Dispatch from Suzhou] Since the stabilization of prices in Suzhou City in March, more than ten banking and financial firms have closed down or suspended operations. Currently, in order to seek new outlets, the banking and financial industry in the city has organized the Suzhou Banking and Financial Industry Joint Lending Office to begin systematically concentrating funds and investing them in production. On the 18th of this month, the office signed a loan agreement with the Sulun Cotton Mill, the largest cotton mill in Suzhou, providing an initial loan of 350 million yuan for the purchase of raw cotton. The person in charge of the Joint Lending Office is very confident about the future and is now preparing to organize investigation teams to go to factories and rural areas to understand the situation in order to better serve industrial and agricultural production.
