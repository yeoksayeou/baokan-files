Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: Most of the publicly owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province have now returned to their original scale; production has exceeded or approached pre-war levels. More than half of the province's publicly owned factories and mines are concentrated near Taiyuan City; others are distributed in the Yangquan and Changzhi areas. In the year since the liberation of Taiyuan, many important products such as steel, iron, coke, machinery manufacturing and repair, coal, industrial chemical manufacturing, cement, cloth, paper making, and tobacco have exceeded the levels before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Electricity, spinning, matches, and daily-use chemical manufactures have exceeded the levels before liberation or are close to pre-war levels. Only the weaving factory has lower production than before liberation because it has not fully started operations. Many departments originally engaged in military production have gradually shifted to peaceful production and are vigorously supplying rural needs. The newly established agricultural chemical plant has produced insecticides such as raw copper, copper sulfate, calcium arsenate, and lead arsenate. Five thousand waterwheels, four hundred cotton gins, and twelve oil presses are currently being manufactured. In addition to a few state-owned factories and mines, factory management committees and employee representative meetings have been widely established; nearly 70 percent of workers have been organized. Due to the increased awareness of the working class, workers in publicly owned factories and mines throughout the province have created and improved more than 150 items in the past year.

Shanxi Province, known as the "Home of Coal and Iron," occupies a considerable position in the national industry due to its rich mineral deposits and industrial facilities of a certain scale. The province's refractory materials are rare products nationwide. The scale of the Northwest Iron and Steel Company is second only to Anshan in the Northeast. The province's ninety-two counties (except for a small part of southern Shanxi) have 3,248,000 hectares of coalfields, with reserves of over 1,740 billion tons. The province's iron reserves also amount to 118.77 million tons. The reserves of sulfur, iron sulfide, and gypsum are also extremely rich. Other non-ferrous metals such as manganese ore and non-metallic minerals such as silica and dolomite are abundant, with as many as 47 kinds.

　　Extremely Corrupt Management Before Liberation  High Costs, Low Quality, Workers Extremely Miserable

Before liberation, the larger industrial units in Shanxi Province were almost entirely bureaucratic enterprises of the Yan Xishan Group, with extremely poor technical equipment, old machines and inconsistent specifications. All generators had different voltages and frequencies, and the use of general machinery exceeded the insurance period by five to sixteen years. At the same time, production was strongly military-oriented, with little support for agriculture. Eighty percent of light and heavy industrial organizations were adapted to the production of munitions, ammunition and various military supplies. Moreover, management was extremely corrupt, and a system of coercion and suppression was adopted. As a result, the cost of these industrial products before liberation was high and the quality was low; workers' lives were extremely miserable.

Based on the above situation, the People's Government adopted the policy of transforming military industry into peaceful industry in the early days of the liberation of Taiyuan, and assisted the factories and mines in resuming production. A total of more than 800,000 catties of relief grain were issued to relieve unemployed workers, and workers' wages were appropriately adjusted during wage evaluation. The body search system and other practices that oppressed workers were abolished. At the same time, sales contracts were signed with trading companies, and sales offices were established in major cities to solve supply and sales problems. As a result, Taiyuan's industry, which had suffered from the devastation of Japanese invaders and Yan bandits, fully resumed work within more than 20 days after liberation, and gradually changed military production to peaceful production. The steel plant also successfully trial-produced steel rails during this period.

　　Bureaucratic Enterprises Transformed into People's Enterprises Military Production Changed to Peaceful Production

Immediately after the end of military control, the industrial leadership began the preliminary work of transforming bureaucratic enterprises into people's enterprises. On the one hand, in September of last year, nine specialized companies were formed according to the industrial nature of each factory and mine. In November, according to the instructions of the Central People's Government, except for state-owned ones, the remaining factories and mines were assigned to provincial management or trusteeship, simplifying the original huge bureaucratic organization and formulating production policies, strengthening leadership. On the other hand, the city worker representative meeting was convened, the city federation of trade unions was formed, democratic management was trialled, and mass emergency inspections and production plans were initiated. Because the inspection revealed shortcomings such as extremely poor safety equipment, serious waste, and lax labor discipline, and because of the help of Soviet experts, the complacency of some cadres in various factories and mines due to the rapid resumption of work began to be corrected, and workers were mobilized to discuss methods of improving production, or to formulate new labor discipline and reward and punishment, shift handover and other systems. As a result, the output of some units has increased significantly. The daily pig iron production of the No. 1 furnace of the Iron and Steel Company has increased by 33 percent compared with the previous record. The invention of iron mold casting improved the quality of steel. The workers in the coal mine No. 1 plant created a new record of producing 1.2 tons of coal per day, breaking the current national level. The oxygen production of the Industrial Chemical Company has exceeded 47.7 percent of the highest record during the Japanese puppet period. The number of employees in the tobacco company has only increased four times compared with the Yan bandit period, but the output has increased thirteen times. The cost of paper making has been reduced by about 50 percent compared to the past. The output of textiles, flour, and matches has also increased, and costs have also been reduced.

　　Implement Democratic Management and Enterprise Management Carry Out Quota Work to Improve Production

However, because the administrative staff of various factories and mines lacked a strong idea of relying on the working class to manage industry and operate enterprises, many factories did not seriously establish the organization of factory management committees and employee representative meetings, and most of those established were merely formalities. Production plans and product costs also varied. In order to further rectify, restore and thoroughly transform public enterprises, the Provincial Department of Industry held a meeting of cadres of provincial factories and mines in mid-March based on the spirit of the People's Daily editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises," inspecting and criticizing the wrong ideas and shortcomings of not resolutely relying on workers, not calculating costs and profits and losses, accumulating funds and finished products, chaotic systems, and inaccurate production plans and cost calculations. The meeting determined that the central task of provincial factories and mines in March and April was to accurately calculate costs, initially implement a quota system, adjust labor organization, and establish and improve new production systems. This was used as a basis for carrying out new record campaigns and achieving more reasonable quota management. After this meeting, units that had not established management committees and employee representative meetings have begun to establish them. The factories and mines that had already established these organizations have undergone re-election through democratic deliberation, and under the promotion of many emerging production activists, quota work has been carried out in an all-round way, which has made some improvements in production. The tobacco company combined quota work to improve operating methods and find new standards. In the past, it took ten hours to repair a wooden screw shaft. After testing, it only took three hours and thirty minutes. The state-owned Northwest Iron and Steel Company continuously created new records in steel rolling and coking during the establishment of the factory management committee. At the same time, the investigation and warehouse inventory work of various factories and mines is also actively underway.

　　山西省公营厂矿大部恢复
　　产量已超过或接近了战前水平
　　许多军事生产转变为和平生产大量供应农村
    【新华社讯】太原消息：山西省大部公营厂矿现已恢复原有规模；产量已超过或接近了战前的水平。该省的公营厂矿有半数以上集中于太原市附近；其他则分布于阳泉、长治地区。太原解放后一年以来，许多重要产品如钢、铁、焦煤、机械制造和修造、煤、工业化学制造、洋灰、布匹、制纸、皮革、烟草等均已超过抗日战争前的水平；超过解放前的水平或接近战前水平的有电力、纺纱、火柴、日用化学制造品；仅织造厂一家因未全部开工，产量低于解放前的水平。许多原为军事生产的部门已陆续转变为和平生产，并大力供应农村需要。新成立的农业化学厂已制出生铜、硫酸铜、砒酸钙、砒酸铅等杀虫剂，五千辆水车、四百部榨花机及十二部榨油机正在制造中。除少数国营厂矿外，已普遍建立了工厂管理委员会和职工代表会；近百分之七十的工人已组织起来。由于工人阶级觉悟的提高，一年中全省公营厂矿工人的创造与改进达一百五十余件。
    被誉为“煤铁之乡”的山西省，由于有着丰富的矿藏和一定规模的工业设备，在全国工业上占有相当的地位。该省耐火器材为全国稀有的产品。西北钢铁公司的规模，则仅次于东北的鞍山。全省九十二县（除晋南小部地区外）有三百二十四万八千公亩的煤田，蕴藏量达一千七百四十余亿吨。全省铁的蕴藏量亦有一亿又一千八百七十七万吨。硫磺、硫化铁、石膏的储藏量也极丰富。其他有色金属如锰矿及非金属硅石、白云石等矿产蕴藏，有四十七种之多。
            解放以前经营极为腐败  成本高质量低工人极苦
    山西省较大规模的工业单位，在解放前几乎全是阎锡山集团的官僚企业，技术装备极差，机器老旧而规格不一致，所有的发电机即各有不同的电压和周波，一般机器的使用均超过了保险期五年至十六年。同时，生产带有强烈的军事性，对农业的支援作用极小，百分之八十的轻重工业机构都是适应于生产军火、弹药及各种军需品的；而且在经营上极为腐败，在管理上则采取强迫、镇压制度。因此，在解放前这些工业的产品成本高而质量低；工人生活极苦。
    根据上述情况，人民政府在太原市解放初期即采取转变军事工业为和平工业的方针，协助各厂矿进行复工生产；先后共发出八十余万斤救济粮救济失业工人，在评定工资中适当地调整了工人工资，废除了压迫工人的抄身制等。同时，并与贸易公司订立供销合同，在各大城市设立购销处，解决供销问题。因而饱经日寇、阎匪摧残的太原工业，在解放后的二十多天内即告全部复工，并逐渐将军事生产改为和平生产。炼钢厂并在此时期中试制钢轨成功。
            官僚企业变为人民企业军事生产改成和平生产
    紧接着军管结束，工业领导机构乃开始进行改造官僚企业为人民企业的初步工作。一方面在去年九月按各厂矿工业性质组成九个专业公司，在十一月又按照中央人民政府指示，除国营外把其余厂矿划归省营或代管，简化了原来庞大的官僚机构，并制订了生产方针，加强了领导；另一方面召开市工人代表会，组成市总工会，开始试行民主管理，发动群众性的紧急大检查和订生产计划。由于检查中暴露了安全设备极差、浪费现象严重及劳动纪律松弛等缺点，以及由于苏联专家的帮助，各厂矿某些干部中因复工迅速而产生的自满情绪开始得到纠正，进而发动工人，讨论改进生产的方法，或着手制订新的劳动纪律和奖惩、交接班等制度。若干单位的产量因此有显著提高。钢铁公司一号炉日产生铁量，已比过去的最高纪录提高了百分之三十三；铁模铸造的发明，提高了钢的质量。煤矿一厂坑内工人创造了日产煤一点二吨的突破全国目前水平的新纪录。工业化学公司养气的产量，已超过日伪时期最高纪录的百分之四十七点七。烟草公司职工人数较阎匪时期仅增加四倍，但产量增加了十三倍。造纸的成本比过去降低约百分之五十。他如纺织、面粉、火柴的产量亦有提高，成本也已减低。
            实行民主管理和企业化  开展定额工作改进生产
    但是，由于各厂矿的行政人员缺乏强固的依靠工人阶级管理工业和经营企业化的思想，许多工厂未认真建立工厂管理委员会和职工代表会的组织，建立起来的也大多流于形式；生产计划与产品成本亦高低不定。为进一步整顿恢复和彻底改造公营企业，省工业厅乃于三月中旬根据北京人民日报社论“学会管理企业”的精神，召开了省营厂矿干部会议，检查和批判了不坚决依靠工人、不计算成本和盈亏、积压资金和成品、制度混乱、生产计划及成本计算不精确等错误思想和缺点。会议确定省营厂矿三、四月份的中心工作是精确计算成本，初步实行定额制度，调整劳动组织，建立与健全新的生产制度；并以此为开展新纪录运动，达到更合理的定额管理打下基础。经过这次会议以后，未成立管理委员会和职工代表会的单位，已在开始建立；已成立这些组织的厂矿经过民主酝酿，进行了改选，并在涌现出的许多生产积极分子的推动下，全面地开展了定额工作，使生产已有若干改进。烟草公司结合定额工作改进了操作方法，找出了新标准，过去修理一根木螺轴需十小时，试验后，仅需三时三十分钟，国营西北钢铁公司在建立工厂管理委员会期中，轧钢、炼焦均连续创造了新纪录。与此同时，各厂矿的调查和仓库清理工作，也在积极进行中。
