　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 20th: The East China Branch of the China Silk Company has improved its entrusted weaving business, adopting a "silk for silk" method to support private silk weaving factories in Zhejiang, Southern Jiangsu, and Shanghai to maintain production. From the time of liberation to May 12th of this year, the company has contracted with a total of 158 weaving factories, of which 117 are in Shanghai, Wuxi, and Suzhou, and 41 are in Hangzhou and Huzhou. These factories have collectively woven 15,655.5 bolts of silk for export, driving the operation of 1,095 looms. However, due to the company's insufficient grasp of policies, imprudent selection of partners, and inadequate guidance to manufacturers, the entrusted weaving business was reduced to a temporary relief measure. Some manufacturers even violated contracts and failed to deliver goods on time. To date, 24 factories, including Xinchang and Meifeng Chi Ji, are in arrears for a total of 665.5 bolts of various silks, accounting for 7.6% of the total entrusted weaving volume. Now, having learned from this lesson, the company has adopted a "silk for silk" method to improve the entrusted weaving business. Any joint venture companies or weaving groups that have broad-loom weaving machines suitable for export silk can, after signing a contract, first weave silk from their own raw materials and exchange it for raw materials from the company every three months. Those who cannot provide their own raw materials can apply to mortgage raw materials, woven materials, and both domestic and export silk goods to obtain raw materials for entrusted weaving. Currently, many manufacturers from various regions are applying to the company for entrusted weaving, and the company is gradually reviewing these applications. The first to be approved is the Shanghai First Joint Venture Company, composed of 23 silk weaving factories including Meixin and Meifu, which will weave 3,600 bolts of silk for export, with a term of three months.

　　华东蚕丝公司改进委托业务
    扶植私营丝织厂生产
    【新华社上海二十日电】中国蚕丝公司华东区公司改进委托代织业务，采取以绸易丝办法，扶助浙江、苏南和上海的私营丝绸织厂维持生产。该公司自解放后到今年五月十二日，共约定代织厂商一百五十八家，其中上海、无锡、苏州三地即占一百十七家，杭州、湖州共四十一家，总计代织外销绸一万五千六百五十五匹半，推动了一千零九十五台织机运转。但该公司由于掌握政策不够，选择对象不慎重，对厂商也指导不够，致使代织业务流于临时救济性质，甚至有的厂商破坏合同，逾期不交贷。至今尚有新昌、美丰炽记等二十四厂家拖欠各种绸匹达六百六十五匹半，占整个代织数额百分之七点六。现在该公司接受这一教训，为改进代织业务，遂采取以绸易丝办法，凡联营公司和代织小组，具有适合于外销绸的阔幅织机，经订约后，先以自备原料织成绸匹，以三个月为一期，向该公司换取原料，不能自备原料者，可申请以织物原料及内外销绸货等物资抵押原料代织。现各地向该公司申请代织的厂商很多，正由该公司逐步审查中，首获批准的已有美新、美孚等二十三家丝织厂组成的上海第一联营公司，代织外销绸三千六百匹，期限三个月。
