Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: A major reform in China's coal mine production—the implementation of new coal mining methods—will be resolutely implemented nationwide.

China's coal mines, long under the exploitative management of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, had extremely scattered and backward production methods. The utilization rate of machinery was less than 30% of its equipment. Production efficiency was extremely low, averaging only 0.3 tons, and the recovery rate of thick coal seams was only about 30%. Although some areas had begun to improve after liberation, changing coal mining methods from residual pillar to longwall, a comprehensive reform had not been carried out. The National Coal Mine Conference in November of last year clearly decided that the old and backward production technologies must be thoroughly reformed, and specifically proposed ambitious goals such as boldly promoting the longwall method and rationally using machinery. However, in the half-year since then, apart from a few mines in the Northeast that have implemented this more conscientiously and achieved considerable success and experience, other regions have not implemented it or have implemented it very late, with the result that the production methods in the coal mining industry have not been fundamentally improved. The main reason for this is that some leading cadres harbor serious conservative ideas about the old production methods in their minds and have failed to fully understand that promoting new coal mining methods is a fundamental link in improving coal mine work. For example, as the Deputy Manager of the Huainan Coal Mine Company said in his self-criticism, he used to think that coal mine work only needed to handle three things well: "mass work," "management work," and "wage work." He could not listen to new things, and as a result, he did not understand the spirit of reforming coal mining methods as a fundamental link, which made the mine's production work very backward until March of this year, when the Ministry of Fuel Industry repeatedly inspected and urged them to begin to improve.

The National Joint Conference of Leading Cadres of Major State-Owned Coal Mines, held from the 7th to the 15th of this month, focused on introducing and discussing new coal mining methods. The Northeast has achieved great success in implementing reforms in coal mining methods. The Xi'an Coal Mine adopted the new coal mining method of "five-section longwall retreating strip filling," which has increased the recovery rate of thick coal seams to over 75%.

Several mines in Hegang, Jixi, and other mines have also adopted similar new coal mining methods. The implementation of new coal mining methods has lengthened the working face and concentrated the work areas, thereby increasing the efficiency of machinery from 20-30% to 40-67%. This not only overcame the difficulty of insufficient machinery under the past dispersed conditions, but also resulted in a surplus of some machinery. As a result of the concentrated use of machinery, some pits have achieved a mechanization rate of over 50% in terms of China's existing mechanical conditions. Due to the adoption of new coal mining methods and the resulting concentration of machinery and work areas, production efficiency has increased from around 0.6 tons to 0.7 or even 0.82 tons, and costs have been reduced by more than 15%. Under the conditions of new coal mining methods, coupled with leadership's emphasis on safety improvement work, casualties have been significantly reduced. In the first quarter of this year, there were no deaths in the fields where coal mining methods were changed in Hegang Mine.

Even in Shandong and Huainan, where the implementation of reforms was relatively late, the effectiveness of the new coal mining methods is also very significant. The trial implementation of the longwall method in the seventh row of the sixth well of the Hongshan Mine in Shandong for 20 days has increased the recovery rate from 75% to 85% and production efficiency from 0.4 to 0.45 tons; while the production efficiency of the first well of the Xinbo Mine has increased from 0.4 to 0.7 tons. In April, the trial implementation of the longwall method in the North Second Groove and Fourth Groove of the Jiulonggang Mine in Huainan increased the recovery rate from 80% to 90%, doubled production efficiency, and resulted in no casualties throughout the month.

These facts have led all participants in the National Joint Conference of Leading Cadres of Major State-Owned Coal Mines to unanimously recognize that the improvement of coal mining methods is the central link in doing a good job in coal mine work and is a major reform in China's coal mine production. As a result of the reform of coal mining methods, a series of problems in coal mine production can be solved. The National Joint Conference of Leading Cadres of Major State-Owned Coal Mines has formulated a draft decision on "Comprehensively Promoting Production Method Reform in State-Owned Coal Mines." The participants expressed their determination to adopt various new coal mining methods according to the geological conditions and pit conditions of each mine, and to resolutely implement them.

　　中国煤矿生产上的一大改革
    鹤岗等矿应用新采煤法  生产效率提高事故减少
    全国国营煤矿将坚决采用各种新法采煤
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国煤矿生产上的大改革——实行新采煤方法，将在全国范围坚决贯彻执行。
    中国煤矿过去长期在帝国主义和官僚资本主义的掠夺性经营下，生产方法极其分散落后，机械利用率尚不足其设备的百分之三十，生产效率极低，平均仅○·三吨，其厚煤层回采率仅及百分之三十；解放后虽有些地区已着手改进，采煤方法由残柱式改为长壁式，但未全面进行改革。去年十一月全国煤矿会议曾明确决定必须彻底改革旧的和落后的生产技术，并具体地提出大胆推行长壁法、合理使用机械等努力目标。但迄今半年，除东北若干矿比较认真地执行并取得不少成绩与经验外，其他地区尚未执行或执行甚晚，以致在煤矿工业中生产方法没有根本改进。其原因，主要是一部分领导干部在思想上对旧的生产方法存有严重的保守观念，未能很好领会推行新采煤方法是改进煤矿工作的基本环节。即如淮南煤矿公司副经理在检讨时所说，他过去以为煤矿工作只要办好“群众工作”、“管理工作”、“工资工作”三件事就行，对新的东西听不进去，以致不了解改革采煤方法这一基本环节的精神，使该矿生产工作迄甚落后，直到今年三月，由于中央燃料工业部的再三检查督促，才着手改进。
    在本月七日至十五日召开的全国各大国营煤矿领导干部联席会议，对新采煤方法曾着重予以介绍和讨论。东北在执行改革采煤方法上获得了很大成绩。西安煤矿采用了“五段长壁后退带状充填”的新采煤方法，已使厚煤层回采率提高到百分之七十五以上。
    鹤岗、鸡西等矿若干矿井亦采用了与此相仿的新采煤方法。新采煤法的实行，延长了工作面、集中了工作场子，因而使机械效率得以由百分之二三十提高到百分之四十至六十七，不仅克服了过去分散情况下机械不足的困难，而且某些机械尚且因之有余。机械集中使用之结果，已使若干坑井按中国现有机械条件而言的机械化达到了百分之五十以上。由于新采煤方法的采用及其随之而来的机械集中与场子集中，其生产效率即由○·六吨左右增至○·七甚至○·八二吨，因而成本也降低了百分之十五以上。在新采煤方法的条件下，加以领导上重视了安全改善工作，已使死伤事故显著减少，鹤岗矿今年第一季在改变采煤方法的场子中已无一死亡。
    即以执行改革较迟之山东与淮南来说，新采煤方法的成效也很显著。山东洪山矿洪六井七行试行长壁法二十天的结果，已使回采率由百分之七十五提高到百分之八十五，生产效率由○·四提高到○·四五吨；而新博矿一所一井的生产效率更由○·四提高到○·七吨。淮南九龙岗矿场北二槽四槽四月份试行长壁法，回采率由百分之八十增至九十，生产效率提高一倍，且全月无一伤亡。
    这些事实，使此次全国各大国营煤矿领导干部会议全体与会人员一致认识到采煤方法的改进是作好煤矿工作的中心环节，是中国煤矿生产上的一大改革。由于采煤方法的改革，煤矿生产方面的一系列问题均能获得解决。此次全国各大国营煤矿领导干部联席会议已制定了关于《国营煤矿全面推行生产方法改革的决定》草案。与会者纷纷表示决心，将根据各矿地质条件及坑口条件，分别采用各种新采煤方法，并坚决予以贯彻执行。
