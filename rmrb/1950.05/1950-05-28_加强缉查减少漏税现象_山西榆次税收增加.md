Strengthening Inspection and Reducing Tax Evasion
	Increased Tax Revenue in Yuci, Shanxi
[Report from this newspaper] Tax revenue work in various counties of the Yuci Special District in Shanxi Province has achieved considerable success due to the attention of Party and government leaders, in-depth publicity work, and the strengthening of extensive inspection work. Tax revenue for the first quarter has exceeded the average target.

Since the February meeting of the Commissioner and County Heads, the counties in the district have attached importance to tax collection. The counties have also successively held bureau chief meetings and other special meetings to discuss the cleaning up of markets, the supplementary collection of goods tax, and the commencement of the 1950 first-quarter industrial and commercial tax. The Deputy Director of the Yangquan Industrial and Mining District Committee personally participated in and took charge of the leadership in the work of cleaning up the market and assessing and collecting industrial and commercial taxes. Shouyang and other counties have listed tax revenue work as one of the central tasks. This has reversed the long-standing erroneous idea of tax personnel underestimating tax work, and they have taken active action. For example, Shouyang Mountainous Area conducted a planned clean-up of the market and strengthened the inspection of stamp duty and transaction tax, which doubled the tax revenue in March. In addition to making up for the shortfall in February, it also exceeded the target by 174.1 shi of rice. The three county towns of Yangquan, Pingyao, and Yuci are three to four times larger than Shouyang, but the transaction tax is far less than that of Shouyang. This illustrates the seriousness of tax evasion, which immediately attracted the attention of the leaders of the respective counties. The Yuci tax authorities also immediately launched inspection work, so that the tax revenue in March exceeded the target by 109 percent, more than three times higher than in February.

In addition, Zuoquan (Liaoxian) and Xiyang counties used publicity and mobilization methods such as forums, explanations, and blackboards to commend the good, criticize the bad, and focus on clearing up merchants' thoughts and stabilizing emotions, so that tax evasion was reduced, and all kinds of tax revenue exceeded the target. Zuoquan exceeded by 67 percent, and Xiyang exceeded by 55 percent; the stamp tax branch, in addition to making up for the shortfall in February, also exceeded by 30 percent. Only Jiexiu County's stamp tax was the worst in completing the task due to the lack of tight inspection work, with monthly revenue of only 12 shi, only one-fifth of Shouyang's.

In total, the entire district completed 29,267.9 shi, exceeding the average target by 2,592.9 shi, accounting for 9.72 percent of the first quarter's average target. (Liu Genglong, Liu Buheng, Zhu Guosheng)

　　加强缉查减少漏税现象
    山西榆次税收增加
    【本报讯】山西榆次专区各县税收工作，由于党政领导干部的重视，宣传工作的深入，广泛与缉查工作的加强，已作出相当成绩，首季税款收入已超过平均任务。
    该专区各县自二月份专员、县长会议后，重视了税收工作，各县并先后开过县局长会议及其他专门会议，研讨清理市场、补征货物税和一九五○年第一季度工商业税的开征问题。阳泉工矿区委副主任在清理市场及工商税评议征收工作中，均实际参加掌握领导。寿阳等县则把税收工作列为中心任务之一，这样就扭转了税收人员长期存在的轻视税务工作的错误思想，并积极行动起来。如寿阳山地经有计划地进行清理市场和加强印花、交易税的缉查，使三月份税款收入增加一倍，除将二月份补足外，还超过任务合米一七四·一石。阳泉、平遥、榆次三个县城，均比寿阳大三、四倍，而交易税却远不如寿阳。这说明了漏税现象的严重性，当即引起各该县领导上的注意。榆次税务机关亦随即展开缉查工作，使三月份入库税款超过任务百分之一○九，比二月份增加三倍多。
    此外，左权（辽县）、昔阳等县，利用座谈、讲解、黑板报等宣传动员，表扬好的，批评坏的，并着重打通商户思想，稳定情绪，使漏税减少，各种税收均超过任务。计左权超过百分之六十七，昔阳超过百分之五十五；印花税全分局除补足二月份短数外，还超过百分之三。只有介休县印花税，由于缉查工作抓得不紧，故完成任务最差，每月收入仅十二石，仅及寿阳的五分之一。
    总计全专区共完成二九、二六七·九石，超过平均任务二、五九二·九石；占首季平均任务的百分之九·七二。      （刘庚龙、刘步衡、朱国生）
