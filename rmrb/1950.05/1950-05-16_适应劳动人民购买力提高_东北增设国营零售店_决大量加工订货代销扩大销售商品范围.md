　　To Adapt to the Increased Purchasing Power of the Working People
　　Northeast China Increases the Number of State-Owned Retail Stores
    Decides to Greatly Increase Processing, Ordering, Consignment Sales, and Expand the Scope of Sales Commodities
    [Our Newspaper, Shenyang] With the increase in the purchasing power and living standards of the people brought about by the active production and wealth creation of the working people in Northeast China, state-owned stores must supply a wide variety of qualified and inexpensive commodities in a timely manner in order to meet the four major requirements of the masses for means of livelihood and means of production: "Availability, Quality, Affordability, and Convenience." Therefore, in addition to helping factories, mines, institutions, and schools develop employee cooperatives, the rapid and planned construction of a sufficient number of state-owned retail stores in cities and industrial and mining areas, according to the convenience of residents, has become one of the central tasks of state-owned commerce in Northeast China. Past experience has proven that retail stores not only deliver commodities directly to consumers, reduce intermediate exploitation, promote normal financial circulation, and ensure relatively stable prices, but also play a very important role in expanding the sales volume of state-owned commerce, completing cash withdrawal tasks, ensuring national fiscal revenue and expenditure, and coordinating the smooth completion of industrial and agricultural production plans. However, the current number of state-owned retail stores in Northeast China is far from meeting the convenience and needs of the people. For example, in the second quarter of last year, state-owned stores retailed only half of the cloth in social circulation. And in the first quarter of this year, the total retail sales of state-owned commerce accounted for only 21.8 percent of the total social retail circulation (cooperatives accounted for 17.7 percent), and only 10 percent in some places. In light of this situation, the Northeast People's Government Committee stipulated in this year's economic construction that state-owned stores should increase from 392 at the end of 1949 to 1,500 in 1950. It is required that the retail sales of state-owned stores and cooperatives reach 50 percent of the total social retail sales. Also, according to the experience of operating retail stores in Northeast China: the organizational form of state-owned retail stores should be based on the distribution of the masses and focus on facilitating the supply to the people. In cities, stores of different sizes should be established in different blocks to form a retail network. At the same time, a large amount of processing, ordering, and consignment sales must be carried out to expand commodities that meet the needs of the masses and solve production and sales problems for private industrial and commercial enterprises.

　　适应劳动人民购买力提高
　　东北增设国营零售店     
    决大量加工订货代销扩大销售商品范围
    【本报沈阳讯】随着东北劳动人民积极生产，创造财富所带来的人民购买力与生活水平的提高，国营商店必须及时供应多种多样合格便宜的商品，才能适应群众在生活资料和生产资料上的四大要求：“有没有，好不好，贱不贱，方便不方便”。因此国营商业除了帮助工厂、矿山、机关、学校发展职工合作社外，在城市及工矿区迅速有计划地按居民便利条件建设足够数量的国营零售店，已成为目前东北国营商业的中心任务之一。根据已往的经验，证明零售店不仅使商品直达消费者，减少中间剥削，促使金融正常流通，保证物价相对稳定；而且对于扩大国营商业卖钱额，完成现金回笼任务，保证国家财政收支，配合工农业生产计划顺利完成有着十分重要意义。但目前东北国营零售店的数量，还远不能满足人民的方便与需要。如去年第二季度国营商店零售布匹仅达社会流通量的半数。而今年第一季度国营商业零售总额仅占社会零售流通总量的百分之二十一点八（合作社占百分之十七点七），个别地方仅占百分之十。根据此种情况，东北人民政府委员会通过今年的经济建设中，规定一九五○年国营商店应在一九四九年末三九二处的基础上，增加到一五○○处。要求国营商店与合作社零售额达到社会零售总额的百分之五十。又根据东北经营零售店的经验：国营零售店的组织形式，应按群众的分布状况以便利对人民供应为主。城市中，应在不同的街区建立门面大小不一的商店，组成零售网。同时，必须大量的加工、订货、代销，以扩大适合群众需要的商品，并为私营工商业解决产销问题。
