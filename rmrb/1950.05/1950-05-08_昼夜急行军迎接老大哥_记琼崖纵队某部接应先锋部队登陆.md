　　Day and Night March to Greet the Old Elder Brother
    ——A Record of a Unit of the Qiongya Column Receiving the Landing of the Vanguard Troops
    Chen Huan
    After a day and night of rapid marching, a unit of the People's Liberation Army Qiongya Column camped and rested under the shade of trees in a small village. According to their usual habits, the soldiers would have been snoring the moment they fell down, but this time everyone felt a bit strange. What were they rushing for? Some guessed it was to attack the enemy, others lowered their voices and said, "I'm afraid it's to receive the main force!" No one could be sure, but everyone was too excited to sleep. The next day they continued marching, and the messenger said it was to carry out "a new important mission." Although it wasn't specified what the mission was, everyone knew what it meant when they heard "new mission," and they became even more excited, walking faster and faster. Although the commanders and fighters were quite tired after the long march, no one wanted to fall behind. The two companies that were left behind also insisted on going to the front.

    Night fell. It was the fourteenth or fifteenth day of the lunar month, and the bright moonlight shone on the magnificent ranks advancing towards the coast. A part of the troops separated from the main body along the way to take on the task of guarding the area.

    As the guard troops advanced, the northeast wind kept blowing from the sea, and the commanders were particularly happy: "If the main force is crossing the sea, it's really a good opportunity!" Everyone quickened their pace even more. Before dawn, they reached their destination. The vast ocean stretched as far as the eye could see, and only three enemies were seen wandering around on the coast. The commander stood anxiously at the highest point, looking out at the sea again and again. At this time, the soldiers were both nervous and happy.

    All the commanders and fighters waited anxiously, measuring time by minutes and seconds. It dawned, and there was still no movement in the ocean. "Probably because the wind stopped in the middle of the night, otherwise they should have arrived!" "Could it be that they're not coming?" the soldiers guessed anxiously. "No! They will definitely come!" These were the commander's words.

    The sun showed its face, and we by the sea were spotted by the enemy. Machine guns and rifles began to fire at us. In order to welcome our brother troops and quickly liberate the people of Hainan Island, we engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy. Around ten o'clock, two enemy planes flew over the sky, circling back and forth above our heads, then suddenly flew over the sea, circling in the air, and soon dropped bombs and strafed machine guns into the sea. "Boats! Boats! So many sailboats!" "Our troops are here!" the commanders and fighters shouted happily. Braving the enemy's artillery fire, everyone bravely attacked the enemy who was firing into the sea. "Charge! Welcome our brother troops from the battle!" The soldiers charged forward regardless of everything, and the brother troops on the boats also fired cannons to bombard the enemy on the shore. Under the double attack, the enemy finally collapsed and fled, and the guard troops captured a platoon of enemies.

    When the troops and other personnel who were left behind heard that the main force had arrived and the frontline troops had defeated the stubborn enemy, everyone was overjoyed and immediately prepared to boil water and cook rice to welcome the Old Elder Brother. The masses in the village also cheered as enthusiastically as the PLA commanders and fighters.

    By nightfall, everything was ready. Everyone had no appetite to eat, and only waited excitedly for the arrival of the brother troops. The masses in other villages, after hearing the news of the landing of the large army, also brought pots and carried rice to welcome them.

    Close to dawn, the sound of "They're here! They're here!" mixed with cheers resounded throughout the village. The people in the village swarmed out, many busy carrying water and rice, turning the whole village upside down.

    The magnificent ranks arrived in the village, and the brother troops received a warm welcome and greetings from the People's Liberation Army of Qiongya and the people, with everyone saying, "Comrades, you've worked hard!" The northern soldiers, holding tightly the hands of the southern masses and comrades-in-arms, although they did not speak the same language, all expressed the same joy: "We have joined forces!"

　　昼夜急行军迎接老大哥
    ——记琼崖纵队某部接应先锋部队登陆
    陈焕
    人民解放军琼崖纵队某部，经过了一昼夜的急行军后，在一个小村中的树荫下露营休息。根据平时的习惯，战士们是一倒下便鼾声四起，可是这一次大家有点奇怪，这样急急忙忙地赶路为了什怎呢？有的人猜着说是突击敌人，有的人放低了嗓子说：“恐怕是接应大军吧！”谁都不能肯定，但大家都兴奋得睡不着。第二天继续赶路，传达员说是为了执行“新的重大任务。”虽然没有说明是什么任务，可是一说是“新任务”，大家心中有数，更感到兴奋，步伐越走越快。经过长途行军的指战员们虽然相当疲累，可是谁也不愿掉在后面。留在后面的两个连也坚决要求到前头去。
    夜来了，正当旧历十四、五，明亮的月光照射着向海边挺进的雄伟的行列。一部分队伍在途中与大家分了手，去负责担任警戒任务。
    警戒部队在挺进中，海边不断地送来东北风，指挥员们感到格外高兴：“如果是大军渡海，可真是好机会！”大家更加速步伐前进。天还没有亮，就到达目的地。辽阔的海洋，一望无际，只见三个敌人在海岸上幌来幌去。指挥员焦急地站在最高处，向大海里望了又望，战士们这时是又紧张、又高兴。
    全体指战员紧张地等待着，以一分、一秒来计算时间。天亮了，海洋里仍然没有什么动静。“大概是因为半夜风停了吧，不然就该到了！”“该不会不来吧！”战士们焦急的猜测着。“不！他们一定会来的！”这是指挥员的话。
    太阳露了脸，在海边的我们被敌人发现了。机枪、步枪开始向我们射来。为了迎接兄弟部队，迅速解放海南岛人民，我们和敌人展开了恶斗，大约是十时光景，天空上飞来了两架敌机，在我们头上来回盘旋，突然又飞到大海的上空盘旋，一会儿，在海上投下了炸弹并扫射机枪。“船！船！好多的帆船啊！”“我们的队伍来了！”指战员高兴的叫起来。大家冒着敌人的炮火，奋勇地朝着正向海中射击的敌人猛攻。“冲呀！从战斗中迎接我们的兄弟队伍。”战士们不顾一切地向前冲去，船上的兄弟部队也开大炮向岸上的敌人轰击。在两面夹击下，敌人终于溃逃了，警戒部队俘虏了一排敌人。
    留在后面的部队和其他人员，当他们听到主力部队来了，前线部队打垮了顽抗的敌人时，大家都兴奋万分，马上准备烧水、煮饭，迎接老大哥。村中的群众也和解放军指战员同样地热烈欢呼。
    天黑时，一切都已准备好了。大家无心吃饭，只兴奋地等待兄弟部队的到来。其他村子的群众听到大军登陆的消息后，也都纷纷抬锅、担米来欢迎。
    等到快天亮的时候，村子里到处响起了“来了！来了！”的声音，夹杂着一片欢呼声。村中的人们一窝蜂拥出去，很多人忙着抬水、扛饭，把整个村子都闹翻了。
    雄伟的行列来到了村内，兄弟部队受到了琼崖人民解放军和人民群众的热烈欢迎和慰问，到处都在说：“同志们，幸苦了！”北方的战士们，紧握着南方群众、战友们的手，虽然言语不通，但是大家都表达了同样的喜悦：“我们会师了！”
