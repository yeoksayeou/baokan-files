Hengshui Military Sub-district Company Commander Gao Yuwu Disciplined for Leading Soldiers in Detaining and Beating People

    The following is an account of the incident in which the company commander and certain soldiers of the Hengshui Military Sub-district Special Service Company were disciplined for illegally beating and detaining people: The company rented two mu of garden land outside the North Street of Hengshui Chengguan. To facilitate gardening, they asked the street cadres to find them housing. Because they were unable to find it, the company was dissatisfied and harbored prejudice against the street cadres. On April 10th, when 13 ridges of leeks planted by the company were stolen, Company Commander Gao Yuwu gave the Chinese Communist Party Branch Secretary of the street, Jiao Guochen, an ultimatum to find the leeks and arrange housing for them by that evening, or else he would detain Jiao. After returning, Jiao, having drunk some wine, said to others, "Let him detain me. I still have grenades. If he detains me, I'll fight them." In the afternoon, two soldiers went to look for him, but they couldn't find Jiao because he was out. After Jiao returned, still tipsy, he ran to the garden and said to the soldiers, "Your company commander is capable. Let him come. I won't go." He then argued with the soldiers. The soldiers tried to drag Jiao away, but he refused, so the soldiers slapped Jiao twice in the face. As they walked to the edge of the village, militiamen stopped them and said, "You can't arbitrarily infringe upon human rights. There's a public security station here. Go and reason with them." At the police station, the responsible cadre refused to let the soldiers take Jiao away. The two soldiers then returned to the company and told the company commander, "Director (Jiao Guochen also serves as the North Street Farmers' Association Director) cursed you and also hit our soldiers. You should go and take a look." The company commander then called Zhang Suxi, director of the military sub-district's political department, asking for instructions to take a few soldiers to check it out. The political department did not conduct an investigation or study but approved it. Gao, leading seven soldiers and carrying weapons, surrounded the police station, preventing anyone from entering or leaving. The police station chief called the company commander into the room to negotiate. Deputy Platoon Leader Liu Zhenhua and Communication Officer Han Guokui tied up Jiao and took him to the company headquarters, locking him up. Then, they detained the manager of Tianxing Store (because the manager happened to be at the police station discussing matters when the company soldiers surrounded it) and two militiamen (because the militiamen had stopped the soldiers at the edge of the village, preventing them from taking Jiao away). After Gao returned, he immediately dragged Jiao out for a "trial," and Gao immediately said to Jiao, "We fought for you to build the foundation (of the country), and now you've forgotten us..." The company bugler ordered Jiao to stand at attention, but Jiao didn't know how, so the bugler kicked Jiao. Only after the political department discovered the company's detention did they instruct the company commander, pointing out that this practice was wrong. The company commander then released Jiao and the militiamen.

    In addition, in mid-April, when soldiers from the company went to Xiezhang Village in the sixth district of Hengshui to transport grain, they asked a farmer to boil water. Because there were a few ants in the water, the soldiers said it was poison and immediately tied up the farmer and tried to take him away. Only after the village cadres requested it was he released.

    The company's repeated detention and beating of people aroused great dissatisfaction among the local masses. The people of North Street said, "In the past, when the enemy was here, the Eighth Route Army would call the people 'Auntie' and 'Granny' and had a very good attitude. This group of soldiers isn't like that. They don't say anything when they see the people, and they even get beaten!"

    To strictly enforce military and party discipline, the political department of the military sub-district ordered the company to apologize to the people of North Street and decided to record two major demerits for Gao Yuwu and one major demerit for Liu Zhenhua. The military sub-district Party Committee decided to give Gao Yuwu a public warning within the Party and use this incident as teaching material for education in the army. The Hengshui First District Party Committee also criticized Jiao Guochen for his drinking and cursing.

　　衡水军分区连长杲玉武带领战士扣人打人受处分
    衡水军分区特务连长及某些战士因违法打人、扣人而受处分的事件，经过情形如下：该连在衡水城关北街外租有二亩园田，为便于种园，要该街街干部给找房子住，因未找到，该连不满，对街干部怀有成见。四月十日又值该连所种韭菜被人偷了十三畦，连长杲玉武限该街中共支书焦国臣在当天晚上将韭菜找回来，并替他们把房子找好，否则就要把焦扣起来。焦回去后，因为喝了一回酒，就对别人说：“扣就扣吧，我还有手榴弹哩，要扣就和他们拼了。”下午又有两个战士去找他，因焦出门未找到。焦回来后，酒气未消，即跑到园子里对战士说：“你们连长有种，让他来吧，我不去。”当时即和战士争吵起来。战士要把焦架走，焦不走，战士即打了焦两个大嘴巴。他们走到村边被民兵截住说：“你们不能随便侵犯人权，这里有公安派出所，去说说理吧。”到了派出所，该所负责干部不让战士将焦带走。两个战士随即回到连部对连长说：“主任（焦国臣兼北街农会主任）骂你了，也打咱们战士了，你去看看吧。”连长即给军分区政治部主任张素西打电话，请示带几个战士去看看，政治部也未进行调查研究，即批准了。杲带七个战士，携带武器将派出所包围，不让出入。派出所负责人将连长叫到屋里交涉。副排长刘振华与通信员韩果魁二人将焦捆起带到连部，锁在连部里。随即又将天兴栈经理（因该连战士包围派出所时该经理刚好在派出所谈问题）及两个民兵（因民兵曾在村边截住不让战士将焦带走）扣在连部。杲回去后即将焦拉出“过堂”，一开口杲即向焦说：“我们给你们打下基础（天下）了，你们这时就忘了这些人了……”该连司号员要焦立正，焦不会立正，司号员即踢了焦一脚。待政治部发觉该连扣人的事情后，即指示连长，指出这种作法是错误的，于是连长才将焦及民兵等释放。
    此外四月中旬该连战士去衡水六区谢漳村运粮，让一家农民给烧开水，因水里边有几个蚂蚁，该连战士说是下的毒药，马上将该农民捆起来要带走，后经村干部要求才放了。
    该连累次扣人、打人的事情，引起当地群众极大的不满，如北街群众说：“过去敌人在的时候，八路军见了老百姓喊婶子大娘，态度很好，这一部分军队可不像那时候了，见了老百姓啥也不喊，还挨打哩！”
    为了严整军纪和党纪，军分区政治部除令该连在北街向老百姓道歉外，并决定给杲玉武记两大过，刘振华记一大过。军分区党委会决定给杲玉武以党内当众警告处分，并把此一事件作为教材，在部队中进行教育。中共衡水一区区委对焦国臣的喝酒骂人等行为，也给予批评。
