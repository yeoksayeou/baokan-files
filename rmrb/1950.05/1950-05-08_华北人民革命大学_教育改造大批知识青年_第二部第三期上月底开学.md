　　North China People's Revolutionary University
    Educates and Transforms Large Numbers of Intellectual Youths
    Second Department, Third Term Begins at the End of Last Month
    [Xinhua News Agency] Since its establishment, the North China People's Revolutionary University has educated and transformed a large number of young intellectuals, assigning them to various regions to participate in various revolutionary works. From March 1949 to the end of March this year, the university has had two terms of students, totaling more than 17,000 people, graduate. The third term of the university's Second Department also began at the end of April, with 1,163 new students enrolled.

    The majority of the first and second term students were young students from major universities and middle schools in Beijing and Tianjin (accounting for 43 percent of all students) and former public education personnel, as well as a small number of industrial and commercial intellectual youths. Due to the long-term reactionary rule of the Kuomintang's propaganda and education and the influence of family (most students come from landlord and small- and medium-sized bourgeois families) and social environment, most students had a strong sense of individualism, arrogance, and contempt for labor and the working class, as well as idealistic viewpoints; a small number of students were deeply poisoned by the Kuomintang's reactionary ideology. However, the victorious development of the national revolutionary situation has caused great changes in their thinking. The vast majority of them demanded to learn and transform themselves. Some of the purer young intellectuals actively demanded to establish a correct outlook on life and the world, and to dedicate themselves to the people's revolutionary cause. This provided favorable conditions for education and transformation.

    The teaching policy of the North China Revolutionary University is to systematically conduct education in the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, with historical materialism as the center, in order to transform the old and erroneous thoughts of intellectuals, establish the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism, and lay the ideological foundation of loyalty and honesty in serving the people. At the same time, the university also teaches the basic issues of the Chinese revolution and the various basic policies of New Democratic construction, so that students have a clearer understanding of the direction of the current Chinese people's revolution and construction. The university's teaching methods focus on combining theory with practice, and combining self-study with collective learning; it advocates freedom of thought, carries out criticism and self-criticism, and conducts regular ideological summaries, using typical demonstrations to promote students to consciously carry out self-transformation.

    In addition to theoretical and policy studies, the university's students also participate in practical labor such as planting vegetables, digging wells, digging ditches, and cleaning, thereby beginning to change their erroneous understanding of contempt for labor and the workers and peasants ideologically. In addition, the students organized visits to factories, rural areas, and military units, experiencing the necessity of ideological transformation from the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. These methods have a great enlightening effect on guiding teaching within the school.

    After studying, most students have improved in ideology and politics. According to statistics from the first term of graduates, among the 12,136 people, with the exception of about 5 percent whose ideological awareness was relatively poor, the rest were able to unconditionally obey the organization's allocation of work. With the gradual improvement of political awareness, most students can further approach the revolution ideologically, politically, and organizationally. Among the first term students, more than 4,000 have joined the New Democratic Youth League, and 200 have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Students who had previously participated in reactionary party organizations also expressed their determination to transform, automatically confessing their past erroneous thoughts and sinful behaviors, and some even handed over reactionary organization documents, guns, etc., determined to turn over a new leaf. After the university's graduates arrive at their respective work posts, the vast majority can go deep into the masses, work conscientiously, continue to study and transform; some of them have gradually become outstanding cadres of the people.

　　华北人民革命大学
    教育改造大批知识青年
    第二部第三期上月底开学
    【新华社讯】华北人民革命大学成立以来，教育改造了大批青年知识分子，分配至各地参加各种革命工作。该校自一九四九年三月至今年三月底，已有两期学员共一万七千余人毕业。该校第二部第三期亦于四月底开学，新入学的学员共有一千一百六十三人。
    该校第一、二期学员，大部系京、津各大中学校的青年学生（占全体学员百分之四十三）和旧的公教人员，以及少数工、商知识青年。由于过去国民党长期反动统治的宣传教育和家庭（学员多出身于地主、中小资产阶级）、社会环境的影响，多数学员思想上存在着浓厚的个人主义、自高自大和轻视劳动、轻视工农等剥削阶级的意识和唯心观点；少数学员受国民党的反动思想毒害甚深。但全国革命形势的胜利发展，已引起他们思想上的极大变化。他们之中绝大多数要求学习改造自己。有些较为纯洁的青年知识分子，则积极要求树立正确的人生观和世界观，献身人民革命事业。这就提供了教育改造的有利条件。
    华北革命大学的教学方针是以历史唯物主义为中心，系统地进行马列主义基本理论和毛泽东思想的教育，以便改造知识分子各种旧的错误思想，树立马列主义的基本观点，打下忠诚老实为人民服务的思想基础。同时，该校还讲授中国革命的基本问题与新民主主义建设的各项基本政策，使学员对当前中国人民革命与建设的方向，有较明确的认识。该校教学方法则注重理论与实际相结合，自学与集体学习相结合；提倡自由思想，开展批评与自我批评，并定期作思想总结，运用典型示范，以促使学员们自觉地进行自我改造。
    该校学员除进行理论和政策学习外，并在课余参加种菜、掏井、挖水沟、清洁卫生等实际劳动，从而开始从思想上改变了轻视劳动及工农群众的错误认识。此外学员们并有组织地参观工厂、访问农村、部队，从工农兵的生活中体验到思想改造的必要。这些办法对辅导校内的教学，有很大的启发作用。
    经过学习，大多数学员在思想上政治上均提高了一步。据第一期毕业学员统计，在一万二千一百三十六人中，除有百分之五左右思想觉悟程度较差以外，其余均能无条件地服从组织分配工作。随着政治觉悟的逐步提高，多数学员并能从思想上、政治上、组织上进一步靠近革命。第一期学员中，已有四千余人参加了新民主主义青年团，二百人光荣地参加了中国共产党。过去曾参加过反动党团组织的学员，也表示转变的决心，自动坦白过去的错误思想和罪恶行为，有些并交出反动组织证件、枪支等，决心痛改前非。该校毕业学生到达各个工作岗位后，绝大多数都能深入群众，切实工作，继续学习进行改造；其中一部已逐渐成为人民的优秀干部。
