　　Several National Newspapers Transferred to Post Office for Distribution
    People from All Walks of Life Can Subscribe at Any Time
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] To facilitate the subscription of newspapers by the broad masses of people, the First National Postal Conference and the National Newspaper Managers Conference resolved: "The newspaper distribution work will be transferred to the post office in a planned manner." After more than a month of effort and preparation, the Beijing People's Daily, Hangzhou Zhejiang Daily, Changsha New Hunan Daily, Xi'an Masses Daily, Chongqing Xinhua Daily, Shanghai Liberation Daily, Guangzhou Southern Daily, Anhui Northern Anhui Daily and other state-owned newspapers have been successively transferred to the post office for distribution. The Northeast Daily and Shandong Dazhong Daily have been distributed by the post office for several years. For the above-mentioned major newspapers, not only can people from all walks of life in cities subscribe to them at any time at the post office, but also farmers in the vast rural areas can subscribe to them at local town and township postal agencies at any time.
