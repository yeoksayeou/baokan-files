　　Upton Sinclair - Warmonger
　　By L. Kislova, translated by He Jin
　　Recently, the final volume of Upton Sinclair's multi-volume "work" depicting the adventures of a scheming American, Lanny Budd, has been published. This novel involves many European courts, especially the court of His Dollar Majesty.

　　For this adventure story, Sinclair dedicated a magnificent ten-volume work, covering a very long historical period, starting with the First World War and ending today. Sinclair describes his protagonist as having "close relationships" with almost all famous politicians through simple methods, making his protagonist a witness to the historical events experienced throughout this period, not only a witness, but almost a participant.

　　Obviously, the history that Budd participates in, the history he "creates" on many occasions, and the "history" he shows to readers on all occasions, has very little to do with real history. This is history in a funhouse mirror, history in the eyes of stockbrokers, big businessmen, political speculators, and ungrateful cosmopolitans. Moreover, it is a thorough and undisguised fabrication that is needed and useful for Budd and Sinclair's masters.

　　The final volume of Sinclair's "epic" summarizes the life experience of Lanny Budd - a "global American citizen," one of the ardent advocates of the idea of American lifestyle dominating the world. At the same time, it inevitably summarizes Sinclair's own infamous path - the running dog of American imperialism, the slanderer, and the old politician. And, it should be known, the infamous path of Sinclair, who wore the mask of an exposer of the evils of American capitalism and had a certain deceptive effect.

　　This book, with an affected title "Speak up, O, Pastor!" depicts Budd's experiences from November 1944 onwards, that is, from the time when the Soviet army's victorious offensive had essentially determined the outcome of the war. However, in the more than five hundred pages of the book, the reader can hardly see the actions of the Soviet army. The offensives of the British and American armies on the Western Front are described as being successful from beginning to end, but they stop writing about the Battle of the Ardennes. Not a word is mentioned about the disastrous defeat of this battle. Sinclair used silence to avoid Churchill's forced confession at the time - that it was only because of the Soviet army's winter offensive, only because of the heroic struggle of the Soviet soldiers, that the Western Front was saved.

　　Sinclair only glosses over the Soviet army and its role in defeating Hitler's Germany, summarized in the following few words: "The British and American troops arrived in Czechoslovakia, but, obviously, because they received orders to abandon Russian Czechoslovakia, they retreated south to the Danube." "Somewhere, Russian soldiers entered Berlin." - Sinclair had to mention it in passing, but immediately followed it with a description of the actions of the British and American air forces in bombing Berlin.

　　After Hitler's Germany surrendered, Sinclair forced Göring to state to Budd: "It is the industrial production power of your country that defeated us." It is obvious who needs this fabrication!

　　Also in this conversation, Budd replied to Göring's question "How is the atomic bomb being prepared in the United States?" by saying, "Even if there is such a bomb, we should be glad, because it will not be dropped on Germany." At this point, the main intention of Sinclair's work becomes clear.

　　Even before the war ended, Sinclair and his protagonist were already thinking about new wars. He was only interested in one question: "Who will lead this war (referring to the Third World War) - which politician, Churchill, De Gaulle, or Truman?" Sinclair's answer is very clear - of course, it's Truman. Who is the war against? It's also clear - of course, it's against the Soviet Union.

　　In the final volume of his "epic," Sinclair can no longer hide his bestial hatred for the Soviet state.

　　From the mouths of Budd and other characters, a torrent of the old anti-Soviet propaganda of the warmongers spews out. Here is the "Iron Curtain" and "Russia's aggressive intentions," and there is shameless slander against our country, and stupid lies such as Soviet aircraft being equipped with wooden shutters "to prevent foreigners from seeing where they are flying," and so on, and so on.

　　Here are also blatant sighs for the "failed Munich" and for Hitler's failure to abide by the oath to "prevent Russia from invading Europe," and hysterical barking: "Russia must not seize Europe by force!" "Don't let Russia enter the East!" and so on.

　　In his effort to please his imperialist masters and slander the Soviet Union, Sinclair even played such a trick: he forced the late Roosevelt to appear from the "underworld" to explain to Budd his "suspicions" about the Soviet Union.

　　With disgusting hypocrisy, Sinclair insists that the American lifestyle is superior, calling the United States of America a "free and happy country," a "paradise" for honest people.

　　The purpose of all these fabrications, lies, and encouragements is only one - to defend the delirious idea of ​​American imperialism dominating the world. Sinclair appealed to this idea, placing all his hopes on a new war. "Expansion, expansion - this is the voice of America." - Sinclair announced. Borrowing the mouth of Budd's friend, a British baron Pommeroy Nelson, Sinclair said: in the future, the whole world will fall into the hands of the United States, and Britain will play the small role of an "unsinkable aircraft carrier of the United States" in it.

　　It is entirely logical that Sinclair pays close attention to the atomic bomb in his book.

　　Even in previous books, Sinclair had talked about how Budd tried his best to obtain the secret of atomic weapons in Germany. This "mission" of his is also listed as a top priority in his most recent book, although he did not forget other tasks: to take as many museum treasures as possible from Europe and transport them to the United States. Budd participated in the initial testing of the atomic bomb and cheered the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, which, in Sinclair's view, determined and ensured the victory over Japan.

　　The whole book ends with a hymn to that "pastor" Truman who holds the modern gospel of American imperialism - the atomic bomb - in his hand.

　　In some places in the book, he had to take a satirical attitude towards his own lies - we believe that this was not the author's intention.

　　Lanny Budd received a million-dollar inheritance from an American old lady, who bequeathed it to him to engage in the movement to prevent war.

　　After much and long consideration, Budd and his baron friend decided to start the business that calls itself the "Peace Group" - a radio broadcasting trust - and to promote the prevention of war. At first, this "Peace Group" went on the radio to discuss the causes of war, mainly attributing them to overpopulation, and recommending birth control as the only panacea.

　　But soon, this "Peace Group" turned to discussing "whether Russia wants war," discussing what measures should be taken to "avoid defeat in the Third World War"; thus its movement to prevent war became a movement to provoke war. However, the honest people of America do not want war - this is something that even the notorious "Peace Group" mentioned above has to admit in its discussions, and the thousands upon thousands of honest people all over the earth do not need war. The ranks of peace advocates are growing, the powerful movement of people of all countries striving for peace is expanding, and the resistance of the masses of the people to the warmongers is also strengthening. The struggle for peace has become the cause of progressive people all over the world.

　　And what is prepared for Sinclair, who has been a faithful lackey to his masters, is a small place on the rubbish heap of history; waiting for his masters - the American imperialists, the warmongers, is also such an infamous fate.

　　厄普顿·辛克莱——战争煽动者
    Л·基斯洛娃作　禾金译
    新近，厄普顿·辛克莱（Upton Siuclair）的那部用来描写一个野心勃勃的美国人蓝尼·勃特冒险故事的多卷“著作”的最后一卷问世了。这部小说涉及了许多欧洲的宫廷内部，尤其涉及了他的美元陛下的宫廷。
    对于这个冒险故事，辛克莱献出了洋洋大观的十卷巨著，包括了一个很长的历史时期，开始于第一次世界大战，结束于今天。辛克莱描写他的主角凭借简单的方法“深交”了几乎所有有名的政客，叫他的主角做了整个这一时期经历中的历史事件的见证人，不仅是见证人，更简直是它们的参与人。
    显然的，勃特所参加的历史，他在好些场合所“制造”的历史，以及他在一切场合对读者们所显示的“历史”，是和真实的历史极少有关系的。这是哈哈镜中的历史，是股票掮客和大商人们、政治投机家们、忘本的世界主义者们眼中的历史。不仅如此，这是对于勃特和辛克莱的主子们是需要的和有用的、道道地地的毫无掩饰的伪造。
    这部辛克莱“史诗”的末卷，总结了美国生活方式统治天下的思想的热烈拥护者之一——一个“世界的美国公民”、蓝尼·勃特——的生活经历，同时也就无可避免地总结了辛克莱本人的不名誉的道路——这个美国帝国主义者的走狗，这个诽谤者和老政客，并且，应该知道，这个戴过美国资本主义罪恶渊薮的暴露者的假面具而发生了某些欺骗作用的辛克莱的不名誉的道路。
    这本书，带着一个矫揉造作的名称《啊，牧师，说话吧！》（《Speak up,O,Pastor！》），描写了从一九四四年十一月以后，就是说，从苏联军队的胜利进攻在本质上已经决定了战争结果的那个时候以后勃特的一段经历。可是全书五百余页中间，读者简直无法看到苏联军队的行动。对于英美军队在西线的进攻，描写得好像从头到尾都如何如何成功，特别是到了阿尔丹（Ardennes）战役的时候，就不往下写了。关于这个战役的惨败只字未提。辛克莱用缄默来避开了当时邱吉尔所作的不得已的供状——只是因为有苏联军队的冬季攻势，只是因为有苏联战士们英勇的奋战，才拯救了西线。
    辛克莱对于苏联军队，和对于它在打垮希特勒德国的胜利中所担任的角色只是轻描淡写，总括在如下的寥寥数语中：“英美军队到了捷克，可是，显然的，因为接到了命令叫放弃俄国的捷克，便往南退到多瑙河去了。”“在不知什么地方，俄国兵进入了柏林。”——辛克莱不得不顺便提了一下，可是马上接着又对轰炸柏林的英美空军的行动给了一番描写。
    希特勒德国投降之后，辛克莱硬叫戈林对勃特表明道：“是你们国家的工业生产力量战胜了我们。”这种伪造对什么人需要，是显然的！
    也就在这一番谈话中间，勃特对于戈林的“在美国准备着的原子炸弹的事进行如何”这个问题答复说：“即使有这种炸弹，我们也该高兴，因为它是不会扔在德国的。”在这一点上，辛克莱的作品的主要的真意也就清清楚楚了。
    在战事还未结束之前，辛克莱同他的主角已经在想着新的战争了。使他发生兴趣的只有一个问题：“领导这场战争（指第三世界大战）的，将是那次一位政治家——邱吉尔呢，戴高乐呢，还是杜鲁门呢？”辛克莱所作的回答是很明白的——当然是杜鲁门罗。战争是对什么人的呢？也很清楚。——当然是对苏联罗。
    在他的“史诗”的结尾这一卷中，辛克莱已经无法掩饰他对于苏维埃国家的兽性的憎恨了。
    从勃特和其他人物的嘴里，喷出战争煽动者们的老一套的反苏宣传的急流。这儿是“铁幕”和“俄国的侵略动向”，那儿是对于我们国家的无耻的诽谤，和诸如苏联飞机里设有木制的百叶窗“使外国人看不出他们所飞临的地点”之类的愚蠢的谎话，等等，等等。
    这儿还有对于“失败了的慕尼黑”和对于不遵守“防止俄国侵入欧洲”的誓约的希特勒的公然的慨叹，还有歇斯蒂里的狂吠：“不许俄国以武力攫取欧洲！”“不让俄国进入东方！”等等。
    在讨好他的帝国主义主子和中伤苏联的努力中，辛克莱甚至于玩了这样的一手：他硬使已故的罗斯福从“阴间”出现，来向勃特说明他对苏联的“怀疑”。
    辛克莱带着令人作呕的伪善，一口咬定美国生活方式是优越的，叫做美利坚合众国的是“自由的愉快的国家”，是老实人的“乐土”。
    这全部的伪造、谎言和鼓励的目的只是一个——辩护美帝国主义统治世界这个梦呓的思想。辛克莱向着这个思想呼吁，把他的全部希望寄托在新的战争上。“扩张、扩张，——这是美国的声音。”——辛克莱宣布了。借了勃特的朋友，一个英国男爵包末洛衣·奈尔逊（Pommeroy Nelson）的嘴，辛克莱说道：到将来，全世界是都要落在美国手里的，英国在这里面担任的是一个“美国的不沉航空母舰”的渺小角色。
    辛克莱在自己的书中很注意原子炸弹，这是完全合乎逻辑的。
    便在以前的几本书中，辛克莱已经讲到了勃特在德国怎样竭力想获得原子武器的秘密。他的这个“使命”在他这最近的一本书里，也是列于首要地位的，虽然他并未忘掉其他的任务：尽可能的把更多的博物馆里的珍品从欧洲取出来运到美国去。勃特参与了原子炸弹的最初的试验并欢呼了原子炸弹在广岛的爆炸，这爆炸，照辛克莱的看法，就是决定并确保了对日本的胜利的。
    全书是在对那位手里握着美国帝国主义者的现代福音书——原子炸弹——的“牧师”杜鲁门的赞诗中结束的。
    在全书中也有若干地方，对他自己的谎话不得不采取讽刺的态度，——我们相信，这不是出于作者的本意。
    蓝尼·勃特从一个美国老太婆得到了一笔百万元的遗产，这个老太婆给他遗嘱叫他从事防止战争的运动。
    经过了许多的和长时间的考虑之后，勃特同他那位男爵朋友一道决定创办那自称“和平集团”的事业——无线电广播托辣斯，并且作防止战争的宣传。起初的时候，这个“和平集团”上了电台，讨论战争的起因，就中，主要的是归之于人口过多，把节制生育推荐为唯一的灵丹妙药。
    可是不久，这个“和平集团”又转而讨论“俄国要不要战争”了，讨论应该采取什么措置以便“在第三次世界大战中不致失败”了；于是它的防止战争的运动便变成挑拨战争的运动了。  然而，美国的正直的人们是不要战争的——这一点是甚至前面说过的那个臭名洋溢的“和平集团”也不得不在自己的讨论中承认的，全地球的千千万万的正直的人们并不需要战争。和平拥护者的阵线长成了，各国人民争取和平的强有力的运动在扩展着，人民群众对于战争煽动者们的反抗也坚强起来了。争取和平的斗争，成了全世界进步的人们的事业。
    而为这个当了他主子的一条忠实走狗的辛克莱所准备着的，是历史的垃圾堆上的小小的一席地；等待着他的主子们——美国帝国主义者，战争煽动者们的，也是一个那么不名誉的命运。（译自一九五○年三月二十五日苏联《文学报》）
