Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: Disaster-stricken areas in Hebei, Shandong, the Pingyuan region, and northern Jiangsu and Anhui provinces have seen the disaster situation stabilized thanks to the combination of disaster victims' active production for self-relief, social mutual assistance, and strong government support. Before the summer harvest, the food supply for disaster victims is guaranteed. Provided there are no new disasters, it is hoped that they will successfully overcome the spring famine.

Hebei and northern Jiangsu have seen greater success in disaster relief due to earlier attention to the issue. Shandong, the Pingyuan region, and northern Anhui provinces started their work slightly later, but the disaster situation was also stabilized after they quickly caught up. Currently, the people in the disaster areas are continuing to fight with confidence to completely overcome the disaster, and the households that had fled are gradually returning home to resume production. In addition to the 1,532.2 million catties of grain that the Central People's Government had already allocated to various regions for production and disaster relief, and the additional 100 million catties of disaster relief grain allocated to the Central South region at the end of April, the Central People's Government is also preparing a portion of grain for necessary supplementary relief to help individual regions with particularly severe disaster situations to overcome the spring famine.

Hebei: In the past year, various regions have achieved considerable success in production and disaster relief work. Hebei Province is one of the provinces with more remarkable achievements in disaster relief. The Hebei Provincial Government implemented the principle of self-reliance in production for disaster victims, mobilized and organized disaster victims to engage in sideline production, carried out the supply and marketing cooperative movement in disaster areas, systematically organized material exchanges between disaster areas and non-disaster areas, and implemented the method of responsible cadres going deep into disaster areas to inspect disaster relief work. These are the reasons for the success of disaster relief work in the province. Under the organization of the Hebei Provincial Government, a total of approximately 1.34 million disaster victims participated in major sideline productions such as weaving, weaving mats, boiling hide glue, fishing, transportation and marketing, cotton ginning, flour mills, and willow weaving. A large number of disaster victims also participated in more than 40 other types of sporadic sideline production. The Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative played a significant role in organizing disaster victims to engage in sideline production and purchasing their products. According to statistics from the end of last year, disaster victims, with the help of supply and marketing cooperatives, earned profits equivalent to 15,441,700 catties of grain from the production of coarse cloth, native cloth, mats, hide glue, straw braid, and pockets. After the province's cooperative signed four contracts with the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, the Cooperative Bureau, and economic organs in the Northeast, to exchange 120 million catties of coarse grain for refined grain, 50 million square feet of native cloth, 30 million catties of hide glue, and 500,000 catties of fire saltpeter, it greatly reduced the blindness of disaster victims' sideline production and increased its planning. Relying on this foundation of self-reliance in production, Hebei Province has been able to successfully overcome the disaster.

Northern Jiangsu: Northern Jiangsu has also achieved great success in disaster relief. The leading organs at all levels in the region discovered the disaster situation relatively early and grasped the disaster relief work tightly. After the disaster occurred, they immediately led the disaster victims to carry out rescue drainage and replanting. Of the more than 17 million mu of flooded fields in the entire region, more than 10 million mu were rescued in time, and more than 3.19 million mu of late autumn crops were replanted. Therefore, although the disaster situation in the region was serious last year, the total area planted with wheat exceeded that of 1948. After the autumn floods last year, the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office universally mobilized disaster victims to grow more vegetables and early-maturing crops as substitute foods, with a harvest volume of more than 5 billion catties. In addition, the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office mobilized 700,000 laborers to complete the massive water conservancy projects of straightening the Shu (River) and diverting the Yi (River), building river embankments and sea dikes on the Grand Canal, and dredging the inland rivers, totaling more than 49 million cubic meters of earthwork. It is expected that the first phase of the rectification project of the Shu and Yi Rivers can be completed according to plan before the summer flood season. All of these have played a significant role in alleviating the disaster situation and solving the livelihood problems of disaster victims. The move of the Party, government, and military organs at the level of the Huaiyin Special District to the severely affected areas before the Lunar New Year was particularly effective in promoting production and disaster relief work. However, northern Jiangsu was originally a water network area, and since the Chiang Kai-shek bandits breached the Yellow River, the river channels in northern Jiangsu have been silted up and suffer from disasters every year. In particular, the Huaiyin Special District, which is located in a low-lying area, is prone to flooding in the event of heavy rain. The two heavy rains in March and April this year affected spring planting and caused the loss of 1.4 million mu of wheat fields. Therefore, although northern Jiangsu can now overcome the spring famine, it is still necessary to make every effort to prevent new disasters on top of the old ones before and after the wheat harvest, and to continue to strengthen the organization and leadership of disaster victims' sideline production.

Shandong: Shandong Province has reaped great harvests in organizing the people to carry out rescue and drainage, and replanting work, rescuing 90% of the 12.48 million mu of flooded land, of which 80% of the land has been planted with wheat. Considerable achievements have also been made in mobilizing disaster victims to plant early-maturing crops, dig wild vegetables, and accumulate dried vegetables. Disaster victims in the Jiaodong region can obtain a harvest worth more than 150 million catties of grain from this. The cooperative societies at all levels in Shandong, which originally had a relatively good foundation, also played a significant role during the disaster period. The grain exchanged for mountain products alone amounted to more than 50 million catties. In addition, the province has completed 3.9 million cubic meters of earthwork and 1.1 million cubic meters of stonework in the three phases of the project to divert the Shu (River) into the sea, and more than 20 million cubic meters of earthwork in water conservancy projects such as river straightening, channel dredging, and flood discharge, as well as digging 120,000 new wells and repairing 100,000 old wells. It is particularly worth pointing out that, due to the completion of the Yellow River water repair and flood season emergency rescue projects, although the flood level last autumn exceeded the highest record in previous years, there were no breaches in the entire province's river defenses. Therefore, Shandong Province has favorable conditions for overcoming the spring famine after stabilizing the disaster situation.

Pingyuan: Pingyuan Province has fully launched production and disaster relief work since February this year. The project of repairing the Yellow River dikes with work-for-relief has absorbed more than 140,000 people, allowing disaster victims to obtain more than 20 million catties of food. The methods of cooperative societies signing contracts with disaster victims, organizing disaster victims to weave, purchasing native cloth from disaster victims, and lending coarse grain to disaster victims have also played a significant role in production and disaster relief work. After the province vigorously organized the labor force to invest in production, it not only stabilized the disaster situation but also enabled one-third of the people in the disaster areas to begin accumulating savings, and enabled another one-third of the people in the disaster areas to maintain their lives by producing one day at a time. At present, except for a small number of disaster areas where the labor force has not been fully organized and the work of cooperative societies has not been done well, and 270,000 people living in the Yellow River bed who still need to be subsidized or relieved, the spring famine in the province can basically be overcome.

Northern Anhui: The northern Anhui region has long suffered from the devastation of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and has been harmed by floods and wars for many years. In addition, there is no foundation for work in the new area, there is a lack of cadres, and there is no experience in production and disaster relief work, so the situation is the most serious. However, since the launch of production and disaster relief work in February this year, the disaster situation has basically been alleviated. The local government has invested a large amount of emergency relief funds and materials to disaster areas to support disaster victims in organizing dike repair, carrying out various sideline productions, and lending seeds for spring plowing. During the winter and spring, the region organized 410,000 disaster victims to repair the Jianghuai dikes, thereby solving the lives of more than 1.2 million people for two months. The Suxian Special District, a severely affected area, has organized 190 rural cooperative societies and more than 4,100 production teams with more than 49,000 members. Cooperative societies have profited more than 3.37 million catties of miscellaneous grains from operating businesses such as making konjac powder, weaving mats, boiling saltpeter, weaving, and fishing, which can support the lives of 86,000 people for two months. In addition, the region has mobilized disaster victims to carry out more than 40 kinds of sideline production such as oil pressing and find more than 30 kinds of substitute foods such as wild vegetables, grass roots, and aquatic products. Therefore, the emotions of disaster victims have stabilized as the disaster situation has eased. Since March, more than 80% of the households who had fled have returned home to resume production. However, since the Yellow River changed its course, the lakes have been silted up, the Yangtze River embankments have been in disrepair for many years, and they have been excavated by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, so new disasters continue to occur. The recent new floods in Suxian and Fuyang have submerged 2.72 million mu of wheat fields. Therefore, although northern Anhui can overcome the spring famine before the summer harvest, it must seriously fight against the new disasters that have occurred and may occur.

　　河北山东平原苏北皖北救灾有成绩
    夏收前灾民口粮有保证
    各地人民正为完全战胜灾荒继续奋斗
    【新华社二十八日讯】河北、山东、平原、苏北、皖北等地的重灾区，在灾民积极生产自救、社会互助和政府大力协助三者结合的方针下，灾情已停止发展。在夏收之前，灾民口粮已有保证，只要不再发生新灾，可望胜利度过春荒。
    在与灾荒斗争中，河北、苏北因注意较早，成绩较大。山东、平原、皖北等地的工作稍晚一步，但在后来急起直追以后，灾情亦先后稳定。目前，各灾区人民正在有信心地为完全度过灾荒而继续奋斗，原有的外逃户亦正陆续回家生产。中央人民政府除早已拨付各地用于生产救灾的十五亿三千二百余万斤粮食及四月底增拨中南区救灾粮一亿斤外，为了帮助个别灾情特重地区度过春荒，还准备一部分粮食作必要的补充救济。
    河北  一年来，各地在生产救灾工作中，都获得了不少成绩。河北省是救灾成绩较为显著的省区之一。河北省政府贯彻了灾民生产自救方针，发动与组织了灾民进行副业生产，开展了灾区供销合作运动，有计划地组织了灾区与非灾区的物资交流，以及实行了负责干部深入灾区检查救灾工作的方法，是该省救灾工作成功的原因。在河北省政府的组织之下，共约一百三十四万灾民参加了纺织、织席、熬皮硝、打鱼、运输运销、轧花、粉房、编柳等主要副业生产，另有大批灾民参加了其他四十余种零星副业生产。河北省供销合作社在组织灾民从事副业生产与收购其产品方面，起了很大作用。据去年年底统计，灾民在供销社扶助下，因生产大布、土布、席、皮硝、草帽辫、口袋等项，即得利一千五百四十四万一千七百斤粮食。该省合作社与中央人民政府贸易部、合作局及东北的经济机关订立了一亿二千万斤粗粮换细粮，五千万方尺土布、三千万斤皮硝和五十万斤火硝等四个合同后，大大减少了灾民副业生产的盲目性，增加了它的计划性。依靠这一生产自救的基础，河北省已能胜利度过灾荒。
    苏北  苏北的救灾成绩亦很大。该区各级领导机关发现灾情较为及时，救灾工作抓得较紧，在灾害发生后，曾立即领导灾民进行了抢救排水，抢种补种等工作。全区被淹田一千七百多万亩中，及时救出的有一千余万亩，前后补种晚秋作物的三百十九余万亩，因此，该区去年灾情虽然严重，但总的种麦面积反超过了一九四八年。去秋水灾发生后，苏北行署曾普遍发动灾民多种菜类及早熟作物等代食品，其收获量达五十亿斤以上。此外，苏北行署还动员了七十万民工完成整沭（河）导沂（河），修筑江堤海堤运河堤及修浚内河等四千九百余万土方的巨大水利工程。预计夏汛以前，沭沂两河的第一期整修工程可以按照计划全部完成。所有这些，在减轻灾情和解决灾民的生活问题上，都起了很大作用。淮阴专区一级的党、政、军机关，在年前移入重灾区办公一举，对于生产救灾工作的推进，尤其有效。但苏北原是水网地带，自蒋匪在黄河决堤开口之后，苏北河道淤塞，年年遭灾。特别是地处低洼的淮阴专区，一遇大雨即积水成灾，今年三、四月间的两次大雨，即影响了春种工作，并使一百四十万亩麦田失收。因此，苏北现在虽可度过春荒，但在麦收前后，还需要全力防止旧灾之上再发生新灾，并继续加强对灾民副业生产的组织与领导。
    山东  山东省在组织人民进行抢险排水，抢种补种的工作上收获很大，曾救出了被淹地一千二百四十八万亩的百分之九十，其中百分之八十的土地已种上了麦子。在发动灾民种早熟庄稼、挖野菜、积干菜等工作上，也取得了不少成绩。胶东区灾民由此可得到值一亿五千万斤以上粮食的收获。原来比较有基础的山东各级合作社，在灾荒期间也起了很大作用，仅运出山货所换回的粮食，即达五千多万斤。此外，该省已完成导沭（河）入海的三期工程三百九十万土方、一百一十万石方，整河、通渠、排洪等水利工程二千多万土方，打新井十二万眼，修旧井十万眼。特别值得指出的是，由于完成了黄河水修及汛期抢险工程，去年秋汛水位虽超过了历年的最高纪录，但全省河防无一决口。因此，山东省在稳定灾情之后，是具有度过春荒的有利条件的。
    平原  平原省自今年二月以后，生产救灾工作已全力展开。以工代赈进行修筑黄河堤坝工程，吸收了十四万余人参加，使灾民得到了二千余万斤口粮。合作社与灾民签订合同，组织灾民纺织，收购灾民土布以及借给灾民粗粮等方法，也对生产救灾工作起了很大作用。该省在大力组织劳动力投入生产之后，不仅稳定了灾荒，且已使三分之一的灾区人民开始有所积蓄，使另外三分之一的灾区人民能以生产一天维持一天的生活。目前，除劳动力未全部组织起来、合作社工作没有搞好的少数灾区及居于黄河河床的二十七万人尚需给予补助或救济外，该省的春荒基本上可以度过。
    皖北  皖北地区久遭蒋匪摧残，连年受水灾和战争的损害，加以新区工作没有基础，干部缺乏，又无生产救灾工作经验，所以情况最为严重。但自今年二月份生产救灾工作展开之后，灾情已基本上缓和。当地政府曾投下大批急赈粮款到灾区去发放，支持灾民组织修堤，开展各种副业生产及贷种春耕等工作。在冬春间，该区曾组织四十一万灾民修江淮堤，因此解决了一百二十余万人两个月的生活。重灾区的宿县专区，已组织了一百九十个乡合作社和四千一百余个生产小组，四万九千余组员。合作社由于经营拐粉、编席、熬硝、纺织、打鱼等项业务，获利三百三十七万余斤杂粮，可供八万六千人生活两个月。此外，该区发动了灾民进行榨油等四十多种副业生产和找野菜、草根、水产等三十余种代食品。因此，灾民随着灾情的缓和，情绪已趋安定。三月份起，已有百分之八十以上的外逃户陆续回家生产。但该区自黄河改道后，湖泊淤塞，长江堤岸多年失修，且曾受蒋匪挖掘，所以不断发生新灾。最近在宿县、阜阳发生的新水灾，即淹没麦田二百七十二万亩。因此，皖北在夏收之前，虽可以度过春荒，但必须与已经发生的和可能发生的新灾作严重的斗争。
