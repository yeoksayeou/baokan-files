　　Belgian and Dutch Dockworkers Continue to Refuse to Unload War Materials
    Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, May 5th: TASS reported that the strike by dockworkers in Antwerp, Belgium, refusing to unload American arms, continues despite strong oppression, and is gaining support from working people across the country. Resolutions have been passed in various places protesting the detention of members of the Antwerp dockworkers' action committee. Workers at the "Cockerill" steel plant in Ashs, miners in Le Boufre, Saint-Henri-修 and 波列哈佛尔, public utility workers, railway workers in Brabant, and female members of the Belgian People's Youth Organization have all put forward the same protests. The resolutions emphasize that the dockworkers' struggle is linked to the struggle of all working people to improve their living standards and defend peace. The workers pledge that they will prevent American arms from being unloaded in Antwerp.
    Under pressure from the people, the authorities have released the members of the Antwerp dockworkers' action committee who were imprisoned. The chairman of the committee, Van Ton Brandon, told a reporter from the "Red Flag" newspaper that persecution and threats cannot weaken the struggle against unloading American arms. The action committee called on dockworkers to refuse to do this despicable work.
    Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, May 9th: TASS reported that the first cargo ship loaded with American war materials arrived in Rotterdam on May 4th. A large number of police officers surrounded the place where the transport ship was going to dock in advance, and attempted to prevent people from demonstrating. However, hundreds of port workers and their wives broke through the police line, expressed their firm protest against the war preparations carried out by war instigators, and prevented the unloading of arms. Newspapers reported that conflicts occurred between the police and workers. The porters who were mobilized to unload the ship refused to work and left the port, declaring a strike.
    The "Truth" newspaper pointed out that the situation in the port of Rotterdam on May 4th was like that under German occupation. The number of police officers outnumbered the workers. A total of fifteen people were arrested. However, men and women workers were active in the port area of Rotterdam all day, regardless of police batons. They organized demonstrations under slogans such as "We need peace and bread!" "No arms!" "No one should unload war materials!"

　　比荷港口码头工人继续拒卸战争物资
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社布鲁塞尔五日讯：比利时安特卫普码头工人拒卸美国军火的罢工，尽管遭受强横的压迫，仍在继续斗争着，并获得全国劳动人民的支持。各地纷纷通过决议，抗议拘禁安特卫普码头工人行动委员会的委员。阿什斯“柯克里尔”钢铁厂的工人们，勒布佛里、圣亨利修和波列哈佛尔的矿工们，公用事业的工人们，布拉班特铁的路工人们，比利时人民青年组织的女团员们，都提出了同样的抗议。决议中强调指出，码头工人的斗争，是和一切劳动人民为提高生活标准和保卫和平而作的斗争联系着的。工人们保证，他们将阻止美国军火在安特卫普起卸。
    在人民的压力之下，当局已将禁于狱中的安特卫普码头工人行动委员会的委员释放。该委员会主席范·顿·布兰敦告《红旗报》记者称：迫害与威胁决不能削弱反对起卸美国军火的斗争。行动委员会号召码头工人拒绝干这卑劣的工作。
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社海牙讯：装载美国战争物资的第一艘货船，已于五月四日抵达鹿特丹。大批警察事先包围了运输船将要停靠的地方，并企图阻止人民的示威。但是，数百名海港工人和他们的妻子突破了警察的防线，对于战争挑拨者所进行的战争准备表示坚决的抗议，并且阻止起卸军火。各报均报道警察与工人发生冲突。动员来为该船卸货的脚夫们均拒绝工作，并且离开那宣布罢工的海港。
    《真理报》指出：鹿特丹港在五月四日那一天的情形，犹如在德国占领之下的情形一样。警察的人数超过了工人。被捕者共有十五人。但是，男女工人们不顾警察的棒喝，全天在鹿特丹海港区活跃着。他们在“我们需要和平与面包！”“不要军火！”“谁也不应起卸战争物资！”等口号下组织了示威游行。
