This special district is raising a total of 99,400 silkworm cards this year, with an average of 30 catties of fresh cocoons produced per silkworm card, for a total of 30,000 dan of fresh cocoons. If calculated at three and a half shi of rice per dan of cocoons, the total value will be 100,500 shi of rice.
