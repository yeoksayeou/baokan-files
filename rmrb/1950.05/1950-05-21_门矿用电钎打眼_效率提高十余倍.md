Mentougou Mine Uses Electric Drills to Bore Holes, Efficiency Increased More Than Tenfold

[Our Newspaper] According to the "Mentougou Miner" tabloid on May 13th: Starting from the 7th of this month, the coal mining team and the electromechanical team of the Mentougou Coal Mine jointly allocated manpower to test the use of electric drills to bore holes in the 750-foot broom mane production team's working face. Preliminary test results show that an electric drill can bore one meter of hole in two minutes, while in the past, manual labor could only bore eight centimeters of hole in twenty-five minutes. The efficiency has increased more than tenfold compared to before. Now they are in the process of testing and setting "quotas" - standard drilling speeds, and will promote it throughout the mine after the quotas are determined.

　　门矿用电钎打眼  效率提高十余倍
    【本报讯】据五月十三日“门头矿工”小报消息：门头沟煤矿采煤组、机电组从本月七日起，共同配备人力，在七百五十英尺扫帚?生产一组活地，试用电钎子打眼。初步试用结果，用电钎子每二分钟可打眼一公尺，而过去用人工，二十五分钟才打八公寸的眼。效率较前提高十倍以上。现在正试定“定额”——标准打眼速度，待定额确定后即推广全矿。
