Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, in order to protect the people's railway property, prevent sabotage accidents, and smoothly complete railway transportation tasks, has promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Implementation of the Safety Responsibility System on National Railways." The order emphatically pointed out that administrative cadres at all levels should clearly recognize that the realization of production and transportation plans is only possible on the basis of ensuring safety. Paying attention to production without paying attention to safety is an extremely harmful and erroneous idea. The order requires administrative cadres at all levels of the railway to be fully responsible for the safety of factory production, line equipment, train operation, warehouse materials, etc., within their management scope. The order stated that in the future, anyone who neglects their duties, is negligent, or is careless, resulting in accidents and causing losses to the people's and state's property, should be thoroughly investigated level by level, held accountable, and punished according to the severity of the case. In order to ensure the universal implementation of the safety responsibility system, the order pointed out that administrative leaders at all levels should regularly educate all employees with the conscious spirit of being masters of the country, and regard protecting the people's railway property as their sacred duty. The order stipulates that in order to implement the safety responsibility system, on-site personnel shall be assigned to be responsible during working hours, and special personnel shall be assigned to be responsible after work and during holidays, so that every space and every time period has special personnel responsible. At the same time, a strict level-by-level safety inspection system should be established. In the future, safety work will be used as one of the criteria for assessing the work performance of employees. The order also requires railway bureaus to formulate various safety systems, safety rules, and safety covenants based on their specific circumstances, and organize employees to abide by and implement them.
Xinhua News Agency, 30th. In order to ensure the safety of train operations on national railways, the Ministry of Railways of the Central Government has specially submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government for approval the establishment of a train operation safety supervision office for the national railway system. The General Supervision Office officially started work in mid-May. Railway Administration Bureaus and sub-bureaus will also establish supervision offices and supervision sub-offices. The task of the Supervision Office is to be solely responsible for handling and preventing railway traffic accidents. In order to achieve this goal, the Ministry of Railways has decided that the scope of work of the Supervision Office is: 1. Regularly check the implementation status of railway technical management regulations and relevant train operation regulations and orders in all aspects of stations, trains, etc.; regularly check whether locomotives, vehicles, lines, switches, signals, communications, and boiler equipment can ensure train operation safety. 2. When a major accident occurs, go to the scene as quickly as possible to conduct a detailed investigation of the cause, responsibility, and losses of the accident, and formulate measures to prevent recurrence. 3. Organize an examination committee from May 1st to August 31st every year to conduct examinations on train operation regulations for train operation personnel at all levels. 4. Study and summarize the experience of train operation accidents, put forward effective suggestions for eliminating accidents, formulate specific improvement measures related to train operation safety, and, together with relevant units, supervise train operation work to ensure the safety of train operation.

    【新华社三十日讯】为保证全国铁路行车安全，中央铁道部特呈准中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会，设立全国铁路系统的行车安全监察室。总监察室已于五月中旬正式开始工作。各铁路管理局及分局亦将设立监察室及监察分室。监察室之任务为专责处理和防止铁路行车事故。为了达到这一目的，铁道部决定监察室的工作范围为：一、经常检查车站、列车等各方面对铁路技术管理规程及有关行车规章命令的执行状况；经常检查机车、车辆、线路、道岔、号志、通信及锅炉设备等是否能保证行车安全。二、发生重大事故时，以最快速度前往现场详细调查事故原因、责任及损失，制定办法防止再度发生。三、每年五月一日至八月三十一日组织考试委员会，对各级行车人员进行有关行车规章之考试。四、研究并总结行车事故的经验，提出有效消灭事故的意见，制定有关行车安全具体改善办法，会同有关单位督导行车工作，以确实保证行车之安全。
