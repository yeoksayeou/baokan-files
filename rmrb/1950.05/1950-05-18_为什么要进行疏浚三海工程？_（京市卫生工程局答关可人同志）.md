　　Why Undertake the Dredging of the Three Seas Project?
　　(Reply from the Beijing Municipal Health and Engineering Bureau to Comrade Guan Keren)
To the Editor:
    Considering the current national financial and economic difficulties, the government's current construction policy is: to focus on restoring production and to postpone what can be postponed. Therefore, I do not understand what it means to mobilize such a vast amount of manpower and resources (even mobilizing military gasoline vehicles) to dredge Beihai and Zhongnanhai. Can dredging Zhongnanhai or Beihai be delayed for a year or two? Guan Keren

    Comrade Guan Keren's question has been forwarded to the Beijing Municipal People's Government Health and Engineering Bureau for a reply as follows:
Comrade Guan Keren:
    Your question is very good. There may be more people who have doubts about dredging the Three Seas. We are now providing a brief reply as follows:
    (1) The construction of Beijing's river and lake system has a history of hundreds of years and is quite complete. It is not only a beautiful place for residents to relax, but it can also regulate air humidity to benefit the health of citizens. However, due to the result of decades of reactionary rule, it has played exactly the opposite role; waterways are blocked with silt, mosquitoes breed, and the stench is overwhelming, becoming a source of infectious diseases, seriously affecting the health of citizens. In order to eliminate the source of infectious diseases and protect the health of citizens, the People's Government exerted great efforts last year to remove garbage. This year, in order to fundamentally solve the problem, it has been decided to dredge the moats, the Forbidden City moat, the North, Central and South Seas, Shichahai, Jishuitan, and the lotus pond in Zhongshan Park to remove silt and weeds and prevent mosquito breeding. At the same time, the Municipal Government has also decided to dredge the Yuquanshan spring pool, Jin River, and Chang River, and to build machine wells to ensure sufficient water sources; to excavate and repair 100 kilometers of sewers to discharge sewage and rainwater; and to convert the Longxugou, which is located in a densely populated area of the working people and has always been a source of stench and disease, into a culvert. For the health of the city's two million people, we should and must do these things.
    If this project is delayed for a year or two, and unfortunately an infectious disease occurs during this period, the cost of prevention and control will be greater than the cost of this year's dredging project (last year's experience in preventing plague can serve as proof). Dredging the North, Central and South Seas is only one of many sanitary engineering projects and is a part of the overall river and lake system management project. If the significance of dredging the river and lake project is understood, it will be recognized that dredging the Three Seas is not a waste but a construction work related to the interests of two million people in Beijing, and it is a work that should be done sooner rather than later.
    (2) Due to the high efficiency of the troops and workers, an average of 10,000 cubic meters of sea mud is excavated daily from the Three Seas. However, the originally prepared 300 trucks and 900 carts can only transport more than 7,000 cubic meters per day. This results in a lot of sea mud accumulating on the coast and on the streets, which not only hinders the progress of the project and obstructs traffic, but also hinders hygiene. Therefore, it is necessary to add 100 military trucks in order to transport this sea mud as quickly as possible. Incidentally, the sea mud transported to the outside of the city can also be used as fertilizer for farmers in the suburbs.

### 为什么要进行疏浚三海工程？　（京市卫生工程局答关可人同志）

　　为什么要进行疏浚三海工程？
　　（京市卫生工程局答关可人同志）编辑同志：
    根据目前国家财政经济困难的情况，政府目前的建设方针是：有重点地恢复生产，能缓办的尽量缓办。因此我不明白，动员浩大的人力、物力，（甚而动员军用之汽油车）去挖北海及中南海是什么意思。中南海或北海迟一二年再挖不可以吗？ 关可人
    关可人同志的问题，经转请北京市人民政府卫生工程局答复如下：关可人同志：
    你提的问题很好，可能有更多的人，对于疏浚三海有疑问，今特简复如次：
    （一）北京河湖系统的修建具有数百年的历史，并相当完善。它不但是居民游憩的优美境地，而且还可以调剂空气湿度以利市民健康。然而由于数十年来反动统治的结果，使之恰恰起了相反的作用；水道淤塞，蚊虫丛生，臭气逼人，成为传染病的泉源，严重地影响着市民的健康。人民政府为杜绝传染病根源，保障市民健康，去年曾用大力运除垃圾。今年为根本解决计，决定疏浚各个护城河，筒子河，中南北三海，什刹海，积水潭，中山公园荷塘，以清除淤泥水草，防止蚊虫生殖。同时，市政府还决定疏浚玉泉山泉池，金河，长河，和凿建机井，以保证水源充足，掏挖与整修下水道一百公里，以宣泄污水雨水；并将位于劳动人民聚居，历来臭气冲天，疾病产生最大源泉的龙须沟改建为暗沟。为了全市二百万人民的健康，我们应该而且必须作这些工作。
    如果缓一、二年再进行这一工程，而不幸在此期间发生一次传染病，其防治的费用必将大于今年疏浚工程的费用（去年防止鼠疫的经验可以作证）。疏浚中南北三海只是许多卫生工程项目中的一项，是整理整个河湖系统工程的一环。如果了解了疏浚河湖工程的意义，就会认识到：疏浚三海不是浪费而是一桩有关北京二百万人民利益的建设工作，是应该早办而不可缓办的工作。
    （二）疏浚三海，因部队及工人工作效率高，每日平均有一万公方的海泥挖出。但原准备的运输工具三百部卡车和九百辆大车，每日只能运除七千多公方。这样就有很多海泥堆积在海岸上和大街上，不但妨碍工程进行，妨碍交通，而且还妨碍卫生。所以不能不加调一百辆军用卡车，以便把这些海泥尽速运除。附带地说，运往城外的海泥，还可废物利用，供给郊区农民肥田。
