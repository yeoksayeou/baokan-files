　　Peking University and Beijing Normal University Evaluate Student Aid
    Carrying out Criticism and Self-Criticism
    Examining Learning Attitudes and Methods
    [Our Newspaper] Beijing National Normal University has completed the evaluation of People's Student Aid for this term on the 11th. At the beginning of the evaluation, Professor Ding Haochuan, Deputy Director of Academic Affairs of the university, made a ideological mobilization report. Then, the students discussed the significance of the People's Government establishing student aid in groups, and examined their own learning attitudes and methods, unfolded criticism and self-criticism, and finally conducted the evaluation in a self-reporting and public discussion manner. During the evaluation process, some students had financial difficulties at home and received student aid, but their learning attitude was not active. The students in the group raised their opinions to them, explaining that not studying diligently was letting the people down, and helped them formulate methods for improvement in the future. Some students who had wasteful habits in their daily lives also conducted criticism and self-criticism within the group. Some students also had poor learning methods and low learning efficiency; after examining their learning methods, the group students jointly formulated a group study plan to help them improve. Some groups also established an inspection system to ensure the completion of the study plan.
    Because the students' political consciousness has improved compared to before, and the criticism and self-criticism in the evaluation were carried out correctly, some students who should not have received student aid gave up their applications; in addition, with the liberation of the entire mainland and the restoration of transportation, some students received remittances from their families, and the need for student aid decreased. Therefore, the total amount of student aid for this term in the school has been reduced to 56,540 catties of millet, 9,830 catties less than the previous semester, and 5,160 catties less than the highest standard stipulated by the Ministry of Education.

    [Our Newspaper] Peking University students recently conducted a "re-examination" of the People's Student Aid. The students first transmitted and discussed the newly promulgated regulations of the Ministry of Education on the People's Student Aid for National Higher Education Institutions in North China in political class study groups, and then re-evaluated their own student aid. After the group "re-examination," a department-level "re-examination" was conducted to correct the deviations in the group evaluation. Then, each department announced the list of students applying for student aid and the application level for everyone to check. The evaluation result was that the total amount of student aid applied for by the entire school was more than 89,000 catties of millet, 7,000 catties less than the highest standard stipulated by the Ministry of Education. During the evaluation, students from the Shatan Medical College and the Physics Department created a method of "economic mutual assistance," where self-funded students in the group with better financial conditions automatically provided for poorer students, allowing them to lower their application level. This method not only saved the country's expenditure but also enhanced the close unity between students. Many groups also criticized students with poor learning attitudes, and after careful investigation, persuaded students who reported inaccurate financial situations. Therefore, the "re-examination" of student aid further improved the students' political thinking and learning efficiency.

　　北大师大评议助学金
    展开批评与自我批评
    检查学习态度和方法
    【本报讯】北京国立师范大学本期人民助学金已于十一日评议完毕。评议开始时，该校副教务长丁浩川教授曾作思想动员报告，然后同学们以小组为单位讨论了人民政府设立助学金的意义，并检查了各人的学习态度和学习方法，展开了批评与自我批评，最后以自报公议方式进行评议。在评议过程中，有的同学家庭经济困难，取得了助学金，但学习态度不积极，小组同学就向他提意见，说明不认真学习就是对不起人民，并帮助其拟订今后改进方法。有的同学在日常生活中有浪费现象的，也在小组内进行了批评与自我批评。还有一些同学学习方法不好、学习效率低；在检查学习方法之后，小组同学为帮助他们进步，共同拟订了小组学习计划，有的小组并订了检查制度，以保证学习计划的完成。
    由于同学们的政治觉悟已较前提高，评议中批评与自我批评的正确进行，一些不应当领取助学金的同学放弃了申请；加上全国大陆已解放，交通恢复，一部分同学取得了家庭汇款，助学金需要减少，因此，该校本期助学金总额评议后已减至小米五六、五四○斤，较上学期少九、八三○斤；较教育部规定的最高标准少五、一六○斤。

    【本报讯】北京大学同学最近进行了人民助学金的“复查”工作。同学们首先以政治课学习小组为单位，传达并讨论了教育部新颁布的华北区国立高等学校学生人民助学金条例等，再评议各人的助学金。小组“复查”后再进行系级“复查”，以纠正小组评议中的偏向。然后由各系公布申请助学金同学名单及申请等级，由大家检查。评议结果全校申请助学金总额为小米八万九千多斤，较教育部规定最高标准少七千斤。评议中沙滩医学院和物理系同学创造了“经济互助”方法，小组内经济较宽裕的自费同学自动供给较为清寒的同学，使他们可以降低申请等级。这一方法不但节省了国家的开支，也增进了同学之间的亲密团结。许多小组并对学习态度不好的同学进行了批评，对经济情况报告不实的同学在仔细调查后进行了说服。因此，通过助学金“复查”工作更提高了同学们的政治思想和学习效率。
