　　From Today, Thinking Back to the Past
　　Wang Zongying, Nursing School of Peking University
　　Because I was born into a petty-bourgeois family, I was tainted with many petty-bourgeois ideas. My original choice of profession was entirely based on the idea of "having a skill to ensure a future livelihood." This led to my current erroneous concept of purely technical views and indifference to politics. Therefore, last year's "May 12th" was spent with a bystander attitude, as if I were not celebrating my own holiday.

　　In the past, I had a significant misconception in my thinking. This misconception made me gloomy and restless all day long, and that was the occupational problem of nursing itself. I felt that the nursing profession was very arduous, yet the credit always went to the doctors. When a patient recovered, they always thanked the doctors, often neglecting the nurses' contributions. Some even said that a good nurse could only prevent bedsores. Because of these things, I thought several times about leaving my job to engage in other work with significant effectiveness. Now, analyzing it, I was too concerned about personal fame and status in the past.

　　On today's "May 12th," I carefully analyzed the surrounding environment and realized that it is different from before liberation, and significantly different compared to last year's "May 12th." Before liberation, many nurses treated their work with the attitude of doing things to earn money. Of course, their work achievements at that time cannot be denied. I believe that no one at that time realized that we should serve the people. In the past, nurses thought they were above politics and classes, and carried out their work with a philanthropic viewpoint. Now, thinking carefully, scientific workers cannot transcend politics in the same way. What was called being above politics in the past was actually serving the bourgeoisie.

　　After liberation, the surrounding environment has changed, and many people have become active and serious about their work. They realize that today's work is to serve the people, and that this work is a specific division of labor in the entire revolutionary work. Nursing work will no longer be mocked as "only being able to prevent bedsores." Especially in the future, health care work will be widely carried out in rural and urban areas, so nursing work is not only limited to treatment, but prevention work is also urgently needed.

　　On today's "May 12th," I deeply realized the incorrectness of my purely technical viewpoint in the past and the error of only focusing on fame and fortune. I think that I would never have automatically written this article last year to expose my thoughts, which may be a small progress of mine!

　　由今天回想到过去
    北大护士学校　王宗莹
    我因为出身于小资产阶级，所以染了许多小资产阶级的意识。我原来对于职业的选择，完全是由于“有技术将来生活有保障”这种思想出发的，因此也就形成了我现在纯技术观点的错误观念，对政治很冷淡；因而去年的“五一二”我就以旁观的态度，好像不是度自己的节日那样的度过去了。
    在过去，我思想上存在一个很大的错误观点，因为这个错误观点搞得我整天愁眉苦脸，情绪不宁，这即是护士本身的职业问题。我觉得护士职业是很劳苦的，然而功效总归于大夫们。一个病人痊愈了，总是对大夫们感谢，对护士们的功劳往往是抹杀了的。还有人说：一个好的护士不过仅仅能预防褥疮而已。我因为这些事情，几次想离开自己的工作岗位，去搞别的功效显著的工作。我现在来分析一下，我过去太为个人名誉地位计较了。
    在今天的“五一二”，我仔细分析周围的环境是与解放前不同了，与去年的“五一二”来比较，也有了显著的不同。在解放以前，许多护士都以做事赚钱这种态度来对待工作，当然不能否认那时她们的工作也有成绩，我相信那时没有一个人会认识到我们应该为人民服务。过去的护士自以为是超政治的，超阶级的，是以博爱观点进行工作。现在仔细想起来，科学服务者同样地不会超出政治的。过去所谓超政治，其实都是为资产阶级服务的。
    解放后周围环境是改变了，许多人都活跃起来，对于自己的工作也认真起来了。她们意识到今天的工作是为人民服务的，而且这个工作是整个革命工作的一个具体分工。护士工作再不会被人嘲笑“只能预防褥疮”了。特别是今后在乡村城市中将广泛地展开卫生保健工作，因此护士工作也不仅只限于治疗方面，而且预防工作也正迫切地需要着她们。
    今天的“五一二”，我深深地觉到我过去纯技术观点的不正确，与只在名利上计较的错误。我想我在去年的“五一二”绝不会自动地来写这篇文章，暴露自己的思想，这也许是我的一点进步吧！
