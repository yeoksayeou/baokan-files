　　Introducing "Gleanings from People's Judicial Work"
    Li Wu
    Compiled by the Secretariat of the Beijing People's Court, published by Xinhua Bookstore

    This is a booklet of less than 50,000 words, but its content is quite rich, and the materials are very novel. After reading it, one can not only understand the nature of people's justice but also gain some insights into the essence of the entire people's regime.

    This is a brief report on the work of the Beijing People's Court from its establishment on March 18, 1949, to October 31 of the same year. It includes "Overview of the Work of the Beijing People's Court," "Summary of Trial Work," "Education and Management Work of the Detention Center," "Overview of Court Organization," "Organizational Regulations of the Detention Center," "Overview of Mediation Work in Various Districts," "Introduction to Several Working Methods," and other articles, with various statistical charts attached. The final part, "Appendix," contains several requests from the court to the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the instructions of the Beijing Municipal People's Government.

    In the first section of "Work Overview," it states: "The People's Court is an important part of the power apparatus of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. It is a tool used by the ruling class to protect its own interests and rule over hostile classes. It is a brand-new people's democratic dictatorship and a power apparatus closely connected with the masses, established on the basis of crushing the Kuomintang reactionaries' pseudo-judicial institutions." In the "Detention Center Work" section of the same article, it states: "The detention center implements a progressive and rational management system, which is not simply about custody, but achieves the purpose of understanding and education through study and labor. For detainees, production labor is combined with education, and detention center work is combined with interrogation work. The detention center's attitude towards prisoners is serious and kind, promptly understanding the prisoners' ideological situation, persuading and educating them, and striving to break the antagonistic phenomenon between guards and prisoners." In the "Summary of Trial Work" section, it first describes the four characteristics of trial work: (1) protecting the sovereignty and independence of the country, denying the past privileges of imperialism; (2) serving politics; (3) serving the people; (4) being active and proactive. Below, it discusses the two basic understandings needed in trial work—what exactly is the court and how to grasp policies in trials; how to rectify work style, writing style, and strengthen learning; how to improve work. The book provides correct and clear explanations for these issues. In the "Introduction to Several Working Methods" section, it introduces methods such as collective trials, circuit trials, resident district trials, on-site trials, criminal court duty system, summary of publicity and reporting work, and so on.

    The people's regime is brand new, the legal stance and viewpoints of the New Democracy and the methods of people's judicial work are brand new, and all of this is essentially different from the era of the old regime. This booklet uses practical examples to explain this one by one. As a booklet that introduces the New Democratic judicial work with Beijing as a typical example, I believe that not only should judicial workers across the country read it, but also administrative cadres at all levels, political and legal scholars, educators, and even everyone who cares about the construction of the New Democratic regime is worth reading.

　　介绍《人民司法工作举隅》
    李芜
    北京人民法院秘书处编  新华书店印行
    这是一本不到五万字的小册子，可是内容相当丰富，材料也很新颖，读了之后，不但可以了解人民司法的性质，而且对整个人民政权本质的认识，也可以获得若干启示。
    这是北京市人民法院从一九四九年三月十八日成立的时候起到同年十月三十一日这一期间的工作简报。包括《北京市人民法院工作概况》、《审判工作总结》、《看守所的管教工作》、《法院组织概况》、《看守所组织规程》、《各区调解工作概况》、《几个工作方法的介绍》等篇，并附有统计图表多种，最后一部分《附录》，是该院向北京市人民政府的几项请示和北京市人民政府的指示。
    在《工作概况》的第一节里说：“人民法院是北京市人民政府政权机构中重要的一部分，是当权阶级用以保护本阶级利益并统治敌对阶级的工具，它是在粉碎了国民党反动派的伪司法机构的基础上建立起来的崭新的人民民主专政的与群众密切联系的政权机构。”在同篇《看守所工作》节里说：“看守所实行进步的合理管理制度，不是单纯的看管，而是通过学习劳动达到了解、教育的目的。对在押犯人，使生产劳动与教育工作相结合，看守所工作与审讯工作相结合。看守所对犯人的态度是严肃而和蔼，及时了解犯人思想情况，说服教育，力求打破看守员与犯人对立的现象。”又如在《审判工作总结》篇里，首先述说了审判工作的四个特点：（１）保护国家的主权独立，否认了帝国主义过去的特权；（２）为政治服务；（３）为人民服务；（４）积极主动。下面讲到：审判工作上需要的两个基本认识——法庭究竟是什么和在审判中如何掌握政策；如何端正作风、文风与加强学习；如何改进工作。对这些问题，书里都有正确而清楚的说明。在《几个工作方法的介绍》篇里，介绍了集体审讯，巡回审判、驻区审判、就地审判，刑事庭值日制、宣传报导工作小结等等方法。
    人民政权是全新的、新民主主义的法律立场、观点和人民司法工作的方法是全新的，这一切，与旧政权时代都有本质上的区别，这本小册子，用实际的事例给一一说明了。这样一本以北京市作典型介绍新民主主义司法工作的小册子，我认为不但全国司法工作者应该读，就是各级行政干部、政法学者、教育工作者，以至每一个关心新民主主义政权建设的人也值得读。
