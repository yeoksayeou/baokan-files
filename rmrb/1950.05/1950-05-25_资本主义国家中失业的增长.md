　　The Growth of Unemployment in Capitalist Countries
    Varga
    I
    Since the decline in U.S. industrial production in the autumn of 1948, the number of unemployed workers in capitalist countries has increased rapidly. According to official, far from complete, figures, the number of fully unemployed people in the United States increased from 2.7 million in January 1949 to 4.5 million in January 1950. In January 1950 alone, the number of unemployed in the United States increased by almost one million. In other capitalist countries, due to the gradually growing economic crisis, unemployment has also increased significantly compared to the end of 1948. The number of unemployed has doubled in Belgium, West Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and tripled in France.

    However, it would be completely incorrect to think that unemployment in capitalist countries is merely the result of a gradually growing crisis, a phenomenon of times of crisis. Capitalism and unemployment are inseparable. Capitalist society, from its inception, has always had unemployment and always had an industrial reserve army.

    The existence of an industrial reserve army in the capitalist era has many causes:

    First, capitalist reproduction does not move evenly but cyclically—through stages of crisis, depression, recovery, and boom. If an industrial reserve army did not exist, capital could not expand production during the phases of cyclical upswing, i.e., recovery and boom.

    Second, the industrial reserve army of the unemployed is necessary for capital to keep the wages of employed workers at a low level.

    "The industrial reserve army, or relative surplus population," Marx wrote, "exerts pressure on the active labor army during periods of stagnation and moderate prosperity; it restrains their demands during periods of overproduction and upswing. Relative surplus population is therefore the backdrop against which the law of supply and demand for labor operates. It confines the scope of this law to limits absolutely suitable for capital's exploitation mania and lust for domination." (《Capital》, Vol. 1, p. 645, Russian edition)

    Marx revealed the internal laws of motion of the capitalist mode of production and pointed out that these laws naturally promote the reproduction and expansion of the reserve army.

    Capital increases the labor intensity of a portion of the working proletariat and thereby creates unemployment for a portion of the proletariat.

    "Overwork by the employed part of the working class tends to swell the ranks of the industrial reserve army; and conversely, the increasing pressure exerted on the employed part by the competition of the reserve army forces them to overwork and to subject themselves to the dictates of capital. The overwork of one part of the working class enlists the other part into its service for compulsory idleness, and conversely, the compulsory idleness of one part of it enlists the other part into its service for compulsory overwork. This becomes a means of enrichment for the individual capitalist and, at the same time, accelerates the production of the industrial reserve army on a scale that corresponds with the advance of social accumulation." (《Capital》, Vol. 1, pp. 641-642, Russian edition)

    The formation and growth of the reserve army are directly limited by conditions: as Marx brilliantly pointed out, by the increasing organic composition of capital, that is, the expansion of the portion of capital used to purchase the means of production (fixed capital), while relatively reducing the portion of capital used to pay wages (variable capital). Competition drives capitalists to use every means to reduce the cost of production of commodities.

    Therefore, capitalists use a portion of their profits for private consumption, while another portion is used to expand production, especially to expand or renew fixed capital. The renewal and growth of fixed capital are linked to an increase in the organic composition of capital, that is, to the adoption of new machines that are more expensive than the old ones, and that can produce the same quantity of commodities while requiring less working time than in the past. If the same quantity of commodities is produced, fewer workers are needed than in the past. Thus, workers are displaced, and the labor force is relatively reduced. A portion of the workers are cruelly thrown into the streets, suffering from hunger and poverty. This is an unchanging law of capitalism.

    Between the First and Second World Wars, the number of industrial workers employed in the United States decreased by 500,000 (7% of the total), while the scale of industrial production expanded by 31% during the same period. The population of the United States increased by 26 million during this period, which clearly shows that the number of unemployed must have been enormous.

    Therefore, the essence of capitalist accumulation necessarily forms an industrial reserve army of gradually increasing size.

    During the period of capitalist upswing, the expansion of the industrial reserve army is relatively slow. The capitalist market is still expanding by transforming peasants into commodity producers. This process was brilliantly pointed out by Lenin in his book "The Development of Capitalism in Russia." But it is precisely the process of capital formation in the agricultural economy that differentiates the peasantry into agricultural capitalists and rich peasants on the one hand, and landless or land-poor peasants on the other; creating a large surplus agricultural population, potential unemployment in agriculture. Millions of poor peasants seek work in cities and factories, as laborers. Thousands of bankrupt, displaced peasants wander the streets alone, looking for any kind of work.

    The majority of the peasants in our collective farms, who have grown up under the Soviet system, are completely unaware of this situation. But the older generations can still recount the poverty experienced by the Russian peasants before the revolution, and which still exists in capitalist countries today.

    II

    In the period of the general crisis of capitalism, unemployment is larger and more frequent. Previously, if the reserve army of the unemployed could temporarily dissipate during industrial booms, then during the period of the general crisis of capitalism, the industrial reserve army turns into a permanent one.

    Comrade Stalin, in his report to the Sixteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), pointed out the characteristics of the world economic crisis that began in the second half of 1929:

    "...The war bequeathed to most capitalist countries a difficult legacy: permanently underutilized enterprises and millions of unemployed, who have already changed from a reserve army to a permanent army of unemployed. This situation created many difficulties for capitalism even before the economic panic, and it will make the problem even more complicated during the panic." (Stalin's Collected Works, Vol. 12, p. 247, Russian edition)

    Before the world economic panic began in 1929, according to official statistics, the percentage of unemployment in various countries was as follows: Germany 13.2%, Austria 12.8%, the United States 12%, the United Kingdom 11.8%, etc.

    All the decadence and parasitism of the general crisis of capitalism are particularly sharply manifested in the change in the nature of unemployment. Mass unemployment has permanent and violent characteristics. Capital cannot guarantee its wage slaves even the possibility of survival in slave conditions. This is the best evidence of the inevitable death of the capitalist mode of production. The numbers of unemployed workers officially counted by the bourgeoisie greatly reduce the actual number of unemployed workers. These materials mainly count industrial technical workers in capitalist countries. Agricultural workers, laborers, and domestic servants are not included.

    But even based on this obviously reduced material, the number of unemployed workers is still enormous. From 1921 to 1936, the number of officially registered fully unemployed workers in the United Kingdom averaged 1.7 million, or 14.6% of the total number of employed workers. This indicates that in the United Kingdom, in the sixteen years before the war, one out of every seven workers was fully unemployed. In Germany, the percentage of unemployed workers among those who joined trade unions was 11.3% from 1924 to 1928, and 28.2% from 1929 to 1932.

    According to a survey by the American "Congress of Industrial Organizations National Affairs Bureau," the number of unemployed in the United States in 1936 was 9 million. According to other surveys, the number of unemployed reached 15 million.

    The living conditions of unemployed workers are terrible. In the United States—the richest country in the capitalist world, where military expenditures this year account for more than two-thirds of the national budget—there is no assistance for unemployed workers. There is no national unemployment insurance in the United States.

    Long-term unemployment causes millions to suffer from hunger and poverty, turns former skilled workers into paupers, and leads to a large number of diseases and high mortality rates among the working people. Unemployment—a terrible disaster for workers—destroys on a large scale, at the same time as imperialist wars, the main productive force of society—the working class. In the book "America Dies of Plenty" by the bourgeois writer Aogan, there are many letters from unemployed workers—these are shocking documents about human suffering.

    For example, unemployed worker Charles Dolley (Phoenix, Arizona) wrote: "I am a steelworker. I have worked in steel foundries for thirty years. Three years ago, they threw me out on the street, and since then I have not found a job. The little money I saved has long been eaten up. Yesterday I slept under a shed by the canal. I am no longer looking for work. I have come to the conclusion that the world is over, and work is over—that is all I want to say. My wife and two sons—also unemployed workers—are dead, which is good. Now I am alone."

    Unemployed worker Mark Kermiko (San Francisco, California) wrote:

    "I am old and have long lost hope of finding a job. I will never have a job again because I am older than the average person who might have a job. In fact, I cannot say exactly how many years I have been pursuing a job."

    The tragic fate of unemployed workers is also powerfully reflected in employed workers, making them constantly worry about tomorrow. Before the workers working today, there is a stubborn threat of becoming unemployed workers tomorrow.

    It is even difficult for Soviet people to imagine all the unemployment fears experienced by millions of workers in capitalist countries.

    The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union has eradicated unemployment in our country. Every worker in our country is guaranteed the right to work, the right to get a job and to receive remuneration according to quality and quantity. The Soviet people are full of confidence in the future, and their material life is steadily improving.

    This fatal fact—that in the bourgeois countries, the time when looking for a job is really found is the period of world war—is the most prominent feature of the decay of modern capitalism. Only when hundreds of millions of people are killing each other and hundreds of millions of others are preparing weapons for killing can capitalist society give workers jobs!

    Even then, not all workers had jobs. For example, in the United States, according to official reports, there were more than one million unemployed workers in 1943, and 700,000 fully unemployed in 1944. The actual number is much larger.

    The existence of millions of permanently unemployed armies has caused unease even among the giants of monopoly capital.

    The famous American industrialist Kasell declared:

    "I am worried about the post-war funding preparation issue, because if we do not have full employment, then we will not only face national bankruptcy, but also face a social revolution—it can eradicate American democracy."

    During the war and after the war, hundreds of books were published in the United States and the United Kingdom discussing the necessity of "full employment" after the war. But, of course, there will be no full employment. Those capitalist laws that created a permanent army of unemployed before the Second World War are also creating a gradually increasing number of unemployed workers after the war.

    The characteristic of the modern post-war period is that their figures on unemployment are even more falsified than before. We can confirm this by using the statistics on unemployment in the United States as an example.

    Before January 1950, according to official materials, there were 4.5 million unemployed workers in the United States. But this statistic in the United States does not include these unemployed people, such as: people who work only one hour a week; people who have job positions but do not work; people who do not have a job now, but can have a job within the last thirty days. It is very clear that a person who works only one hour or even ten hours a week is also an unemployed worker.

    The second category, that is, people who have positions but do not work, are the objects of the most intense capitalist exploitation, for example: in the metallurgical industry in the United States, enterprises often work continuously, but workers only work every other day. Of course, they can be exploited more in this way. American coal miners can only have work for two hundred days a year under the best conditions. In the automotive industry, during the months when new models are produced, the actual number of workers in factories exceeds two to three times. After the new models are made, half of the workers can only work one or two days a week.

    Now, we can find detailed materials on unemployed workers in the United States in October 1949 ("Monthly Labor Review," December issue). These materials are as follows:

    Number of unemployed in industry—3,576,000 people.

    People who have positions in industry but do not work—1,855,000 people.

    These types of workers in agriculture—279,000 people.

    In addition, there are 2,027,000 people in the industrial sector who work one to fourteen hours per week, and 365,000 people in the agricultural sector. These categories of workers should be counted as fully unemployed workers, because they work on average only seven hours per week in total.

    From this, it seems that the number of unemployed workers has increased to 8 million.

    But in addition to this, there are 6,056,000 workers in the industrial sector and 1,604,000 workers in the agricultural sector who work fifteen to thirty-four hours per week. Therefore, a total of 7.5 million workers can only work half of the normal time.

    Now, the number of fully unemployed and partially unemployed workers in the United States has reached 18 million.

    III

    Although the existence of millions of unemployed armies poses a threat to capitalism, capitalism cannot survive without a large reserve army of unemployed.

    "...No capitalist," Comrade Stalin instructed, "will ever agree, under any circumstances, to completely eliminate unemployment, to eliminate the reserve army of unemployment. Because the mission of the army of unemployed is to suppress in the labor market and ensure cheaper payment for workers' labor." (《Leninism Problems》p. 600, Tenth Russian Edition)

    The truth of this statement can be confirmed by the example of any capitalist country. For example, the publications of large capital institutions in the United Kingdom openly expressed dissatisfaction that the number of unemployed in the country was not as large as they hoped. The bourgeois magazine "The Economist" recently criticized Sir Beveridge because in his book "Full Employment in a Free Society" he had determined that the average number of unemployed should normally account for 3% of the employed population. The magazine believes that the normal and beneficial ratio should always be 5% to 7% of unemployed workers, which is more than one million people for the United Kingdom.

    "Politicians who hope to be re-elected (as members of parliament)," "The Economist" wrote, "think this number is terrible, heretical, immoral, and unprecedented. Fortunately, our magazine is not related to the election campaign. Therefore, it does not take much courage to express this belief: that moderate unemployment will be completely beneficial."

    Due to this statement, the magazine received sharp criticism from some readers. In answering the criticism, it wrote so brazenly and publicly:

    "Talking about one million unemployed workers may seem huge and strange. But at the same time, any pre-war government—whether Labour or Conservative—if it had this number of unemployed workers, would have sincerely congratulated itself..."

    As for the current Labour government, it has done everything to make its masters in the City of London admire it. The entire policy of the Attlee-Bevin government, especially the "wage freeze" policy, inevitably leads to a decrease in the living standards of British workers, and the result is naturally an increase in unemployment.

    The rapid increase in unemployed workers in various capitalist countries last year will continue this year. In capitalist countries, the economic crisis is growing more and more, which is especially evident in the example of the United States.

    The United States, which accounts for a huge proportion of the economy of the capitalist world (its industrial production accounts for about 50% to 60% of the capitalist countries), the development of its economic crisis will inevitably lead to the development of the economic crisis in other capitalist countries. Many of these countries have not yet finished the post-war economic recovery.

    It is clear that the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed workers in the capitalist world is now close to 45 million, and it is still growing. This huge army of unemployed workers significantly proves that capitalism has completely reached the end, and proves that the capitalist system is the biggest obstacle to all progress. Only by eradicating this system and replacing it with a new socialist system can the incurable scourge of capitalism be eradicated forever: anarchy of production, crisis and unemployment.

    Only socialism, as the great experience of the Soviet Union has proved, can guarantee every worker the conditions to work for the happiness of society, and to work for an affluent and cultural life. (Translated by Junqiang from the Soviet newspaper "Pravda" on March 19, 1950)

　　资本主义国家中失业的增长
    瓦尔加
    一
    自一九四八年秋美国工业生产降低开始，资本主义国家中的失业工人数目即迅速增加。据官方的远非完全的材料，美国完全失业的人数自一九四九年一月到一九五○年一月期间即从二百七十万增加到四百五十万人。仅在一九五○年一月期间，美国的失业人数就几乎增加了一百万人。在其他资本主义国家中，由于逐渐增长的经济危机，失业现象与一九四八年末比较起来，也大大增多。比利时、西德、日本、荷兰、瑞士失业人数增加了一倍，法国增加了二倍。
    但是，如果认为资本主义国家中的失业只是逐渐增长着的危机的结果，是危急时期的现象，则是全然不正确的。资本主义和失业是分不开的。资本主义社会，从其产生时起就永远存在着失业，永远存在着产业预备军。
    资本主义时代产业预备军的存在，具有许多原因：
    第一、资本主义的再生产，不是均等地而是周期地移动——经过危机、萧条、复兴、高涨诸阶段。如果产业预备军不存在，资本即不能在周期升起的阶段，即复兴和高涨期扩大生产。
    第二、产业的失业预备军，是资本所必需的，以使雇佣工人的工资停留在低的水平。
    “产业预备军，或相对的人口过剩，”马克斯写道：“在营业沉滞与相当繁荣的时期，对现役劳动军施以压力；当生产过剩与亢进的时期，产业预备军阻制现役劳动军的要求。所以，相对的人口过剩，是劳动供求律发生作用的背景。它把这法则作用的范围，限制在绝对适合资本的榨取热与支配欲的限界之内。”（《资本论》第一卷第六四五页，俄文版）
    马克斯揭露了资本主义生产方法的内部运动法则，同时指出这些法则自然而然地促进再生产和预备军的扩大。
    资本扩大了一部分劳动着的无产阶级的劳动强度，因此，也造成了一部分无产者的失业。
    “劳动者阶级中，就业者部分的过度劳动，势将促使产业预备军队伍增大；而在反对方面，产业预备军由竞争所加于就业者部分的加大的压力，又强制后者不得不过度劳动，不得不服从资本的支配。由劳动者阶级中一部分人的过度劳动，强使其他劳动者陷于游惰，又由其中一部人的游惰，强使其他劳动者陷于过度劳动，那已成为个别资本家的致富手段。同时且会适应社会蓄积的进展，而以一定规模，加速产业预备军的生产。”（《资本论》第一卷六四一—六四二页俄文版）
    预备军的形成与增长，是直接被条件所限制的：如马克斯天才地指出的，由资本的有机构成增高，即扩大用以购买生产所需物资的那部分资本（固定资本），同时相对地减少用以支付工资的那部分资本（可变资本）。竞争使得资本家们利用一切方法减低商品的生产费用。
    因此，资本家们将一部分利润作为私人消费之用，而另外一部分则用作扩充生产之用，尤其是扩大或更新固定资本。固定资本的更新与增长，是与资本的有机构成的增高联系着的，即是与采用比旧机器更贵的新机器，与借此可以生产同等质量的商品，而工作时间却较过去为少相联系着的。如果生产同等数量的商品，需要的工人较过去也少了。于是发生了工人被排挤和劳动力相对的缩减。一部分工人惨酷地被掷向街头，遭受到饥饿与贫穷。这是资本主义的不变法则。
    在第一次与第二次世界大战之间，美国工业就业工人的数量减少了五十万（占全体百分之七），而工业生产的范围在同一时期却扩大了百分之三十一。在这个期间美国居民的数量增加了二千六百万，由此很清楚地可看出，失业数目必然是很庞大的。
    因此，资本主义的积累的本质，必然形成了规模逐渐加大着的产业预备军。
    在资本主义上升期间，产业预备军的扩大是比较慢的。资本主义市场即时还由于将农民变为商品生产者而扩张着。这个过程，列宁在其所著《俄国资本主义的发展》一书中曾天才地指出过。但正是农业经济中资本发生的过程，分化农民一方面为农业资本家、富农，另方面则为无土地或很少土地的贫农；造成了大量的农业过剩人口，农业上的潜在失业。数百万贫农即在城市中，在工厂里寻找工作，作杂役。数以千计的破产的离乡背井的整群农民们孤独地踟蹰在街头，寻找着任何工作。
    在苏维埃制度的条件下生长起来的我们集体农场中的农民大部分已经完全不知道这种情形了。但是老年人们还可以叙述革命前俄国农民所经历的，而且到现在资本主义国家中仍然存在着的贫困情况。
    二
    在资本主义总危机时期，失业是更大量、更经常的了。以前，如果在工业高涨时，失业预备军还可以暂时地消散，那末在资本主义总危机时期，产业预备军就转变为经常的了。
    斯大林同志在联共（布）第十六次大会的报告中，曾指出从一九二九年后半年开始的世界经济危机的特性：
    “……战争给了多数资本主义国家一件困难的遗产。就是企业经常地不能开满工和千百万的失业军，这些失业者，已经由后备军变而为经常的失业军。这种情形，还是在经济恐慌以前就给资本主义造成了很多的困难，而在恐慌的时候，当使问题更复杂起来。”（斯大林全集第十二卷二四七页，俄文版）
    一九二九年，世界经济恐慌开始以前，据官方统计各国失业所占百分数如下：德国为十三点二，奥地利为十二点八，美国是十二，英国是十一点八等。
    资本主义总危机时的一切腐朽和寄生性，都特殊尖锐地表现在失业的性质的变化上。大量的失业具有经常的猛烈的特性。资本不能保证其雇佣奴隶的甚至奴隶状况内的生存可能。这是资本主义生产方法的必然死亡的最好证据。资产阶级官方所统计的失业工人的数字，大量缩小了失业工人的实际数目。这些材料主要是统计资本主义国家中产业技术工人的。未曾把农业工人、杂役和家庭雇工等计算在内。
    但就使依据这一显然缩小了的材料，失业工人的数目仍是庞大的。从一九二一至一九三六年间，官方登记的完全失业的工人数目，英国平均为一百七十万即占全体有工作的工人百分之十四点六。这即指出在英国，战前的十六年间每七个工人之间即有一个完全失业的。在德国，加入职工会的工人中间失业工人所占的百分数从一九二四至一九二八是百分之十一点三，在一九二九至一九三二年则是百分之二十八点二。
    依据美国“产联全国事务局”的调查，美国失业人数于一九三六年为九百万。据另外的调查失业人数达一千五百万。
    失业工人的生活状况是可怕的。在美国——资本主义国家中最富有的国家内，今年军费的支出占国家预算支出的三分之二以上，对失业工人却没有任何帮助。在美国，没有任何的国家失业保险。
    长期的失业使数百万人遭受饥饿和贫穷，使以前的熟练工人成为贫困者，致使劳动人民间发生大量疾病和高度死亡率。失业——是劳动者可怕的灾难，它与帝国主义战争同时大规模地毁坏着社会的主要生产力量——工人阶级。在资产阶级作家伊奥干的《美国由富足而死亡》一书中，载有许多封失业工人的信——这些都是关于人类痛苦的使人震惊的文件。
    例如，失业工人查理士·多里（菲尼克斯，亚利桑那州）写道：“我是一个炼钢工人。三十年来我都在铸钢工厂工作。三年以前他们把我赶到街上来，从那时起我就没有找到工作，我储蓄的一点钱早已吃光。昨天我睡在船渠的棚子下面。我已经不再寻找工作了。我得到的结论是世界完了，工作也完结了——这即是我想说的一切。我的妻子和两个儿子——也是失业工人——死去了，这是好的。现在我只一个人。”
    失业工人玛克·克尔米科（旧金山，加利福尼亚州）写道：
    “我老了，早已就丧失了找到工作的希望了。我不会再有工作，因为我已经较一般可能有工作的人年龄大些，实在的，我已经不能确切地说出我追求工作已有多少年了。”
    失业工人的悲惨命运，也强有力地反映在就业工人身上，使他们经常担心明日，在今日工作着的工人面前，有明天即变成失业工人的顽强的威胁。
    苏维埃人们甚至难以想像资本主义国家中数百万劳动者所经历的一切失业恐惧。
    苏联社会主义的胜利，使我国根绝了失业，我国每个劳动者都保证有劳动的权利，有得到工作并依质与量获得报酬之权利。苏维埃人民对未来充满着信心，他们的物质生活稳步地提高着。
    这一致命的事实——近二十五年以来，在资产阶级国家中寻找工作真正找到的时候，即是世界战争的时期——是现代资本主义腐朽的最显著特点。只有当数百万人互相残杀而另外数百万人准备着杀戮的武器时，资本主义社会才能给工人们以工作！
    甚至在那时，也不是全体工人都有了工作。例如，在美国，据官方报告于一九四三年有一百余万失业工人，一九四四年有七十万完全失业的。实际上的数目是大得多。
    数百万经常失业军的存在，甚至在独占资本的巨头之间也引起了不安。
    著名的美国大工业家卡泽尔声言说：
    “我忧虑的是战后资金准备问题，因为如果我们没有完全的就业，那么我们就不只一定面临国家破产，而且还要面临社会革命——它可以铲除美国的民主政体。”
    战争期间和战后，在美国及英国曾出版了数百本书谈论战后“完全就业”的必需性。但是，当然不会有什么完全就业发生。二次世界大战前早已制造了经常失业军的那些资本主义法则，在战后也制造着逐渐增加的失业工人数目。
    现代，战后时期的特点，即他们关于失业的数字较以前更加伪造了。我们举美国失业的统计数字做例，即可证实这一点。
    一九五○年一月以前，据官方材料，美国失业工人为四百五十万。但美国的这个统计将这些失业人都不计算在内，如：一周有不少只工作一小时的人；有工作位置但不工作的人；虽然现在没有工作，但是在最近三十天之内可以有工作的人。很清楚的，一个人在一周内只工作一小时或者甚至工作十小时，也是失业工人。
    第二类，即有职位而不工作的人，这是最剧烈的资本主义剥削的对象，例如：在美国的冶金业，时常是企业不断地工作着，而工人却隔一天工作一次，当然，以这种方法可以剥削得他们更多些。美国的掘煤工人在最好的情况之下，每年只能有二百天有工作。在汽车业，当出产新型汽车的那几个月，工厂中实际工作人数超出二倍至三倍。在新型车制好后，有一半工人一周只能工作一两天。
    现在，我们自己可以找到关于一九四九年十月美国失业工人的详细材料（《劳工评论月刊》十二月号）。这些材料如下：
    工业失业人数——三百五十七万六千人。
    工业中有工作位置但不工作的人——一百八十五万五千人。
    农业中的这类工人——二十七万九千人。
    此外，工业部门中还有二百零二万七千人每周工作一小时至十四小时，农业中这类工人有三十六万五千人。这几类工人按理应该算做完全失业的工人，因为他们平均每周总共只工作七小时。
    由此看来，失业工人的数目增长到八百万了。
    但除此以外，每周工作十五小时至三十四小时的工人，在工业方面尚有六百零五万六千人，农业方面有一百六十万四千人。因此，合计有七百五十万工人，只能工作正常时间的一半。
    现在，美国完全失业及部分失业的工人已达到一千八百万人了。
    三
    虽然数百万失业军的存在给资本主义造成了威胁，但是，资本主义如无庞大失业预备军则不能生存。
    “……无论任何一个资本家，”斯大林同志指示说：“他从来不会同意，无论如何也不会同意完全除掉失业，消灭失业预备军。因为失业军的使命是在劳动市场上压制和保证更便宜地支付工人的劳动。”（《列宁主义问题》第六○○页、俄文第十版）
    这一论述的真实性，可以任何一个资本主义国家实例来证实。例如，英国的大资本机关刊物公开地表示不满意国内失业数量不如他们所企望的那样大。资产阶级的杂志《经济学者》全书在不久以前曾责备贝维瑞奇爵士，因为他在其所著的《自由社会中的完全就业》一书中，曾确定失业的平均数量正常的应占就业人数百分之三。该杂志却认为正常的和有益的比例数应该永远有百分之五到百分之七失业工人，对英国来说即是一百多万人。
    “希望再度被选（为议员）的政治家们，”“经济学者”写道：“认为这种数字是可怕的、异端的、无道德的而且是空前的。我们的杂志，幸而，与选举运动没有联系。因此不需要很大的勇气来表示这一信念：即适度的失业将是完全有益的。”
    由于这种声言，杂志受到某些读者的尖锐批评，在回答批评时，它这样大言不惭地公开写道：
    “谈到一百万失业工人，可能显得庞大奇怪。但同时战前任何一个政府——工党的也好，保守党的也好，如具有此数目的失业工人，是衷心地为自己庆幸的……”
    至于现在的工党政府，它却做了一切使其伦敦城区主人们赞美的事。艾德礼，贝文政府的全部政策，尤其是“冻结工资”政策，不可避免地引使英国工人生活水平的降低，其结果自然是失业增加。
    去年各资本主义国家失业工人的迅速增大，在今年将继续着。在资本主义国家中，经济危机愈来愈增长着，这在美国的例子上看得特别明显。
    在资本主义世界的经济上占巨大比重的美国（其工业生产约占资本主义国家百分之五十至六十），其经济危机的发展必然也导致其他各资本主义国家的经济危机的发展。其中许多国家还远未结束了战后经济的复兴。
    很明显的，现在资本主义世界失业工人与半失业工人的数目已近四千五百万，同时还在继续增长。这庞大的失业队伍显著地证明了，资本主义已完全临到末日，证明了资本主义制度是一切进步的最大阻碍。只有铲除这一制度，以新的社会主义制度来代替，可能永远根绝了资本主义这种不可医治的疮痍：生产无政府状态，危机与失业。
    只有社会主义，如苏联的伟大经验所证明的，才能保证每个劳动者为社会幸福而工作的条件，为富裕的及文化生活而工作的条件。（君强译自一九五○年三月十九日苏联真理报）
