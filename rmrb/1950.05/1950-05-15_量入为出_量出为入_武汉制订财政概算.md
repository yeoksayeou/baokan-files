Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 14th -- The Wuhan Municipal People's Government, based on the principles of living within our means and making expenditures according to income, has formulated the fiscal revenue and expenditure budget for 1950.

On the revenue side, allocations from the central government account for 59.94%, while local revenue accounts for 40.06%. On the expenditure side: operational expenses account for 48.29% of the total budget, with the largest expenditure being enterprise investment, accounting for 14.64%; education expenses account for 8.54%; and construction expenses account for 7.86% of the total. The remainder includes administrative expenses, housing repair expenses, water conservancy expenses, health expenses, agricultural expenses, and other expenditures. All operational expenses have been repeatedly and thoroughly planned and verified according to their importance and urgency. For example, the civil affairs expenses, education expenses, and health expenses have been reduced by more than 57% compared to the original budgets proposed by various departments. However, essential items such as social relief funds and municipal epidemic prevention expenses, which cannot be reduced, are paid according to the original budget.

The budget was unanimously approved by the Wuhan City Third People's Representative Conference held from the 2nd to the 7th of this month, and representatives from all sectors expressed their deep support. Workers, youth, and women representatives expressed great satisfaction with the government's decision to allocate 8.54% of the budget to education, even under difficult financial circumstances. Worker representatives proposed to ensure the thorough implementation of the government's budget by increasing labor enthusiasm, developing production, and practicing strict economy. Financial representatives believe that this budget has indeed taken into account the burden on the people, with additional taxes actually borne by the people accounting for only about 18% of the expenditure. In terms of expenditure, administrative expenses account for only 39.57%, which is incomparable to the Kuomintang reactionary rule era when administrative expenses often accounted for 70% to 80% of all expenditures. According to this budget, the monthly income of each government worker, based on a salary system, is only slightly more than two dan of rice, and for those on a supply system, it is less than one dan of rice, demonstrating their spirit of self-denial and dedication. Other operational expenses are also spent for the benefit of the people. Industrial and commercial representatives expressed their willingness to fully support the implementation of this budget and fulfill the various tax payment tasks listed in the budget.

　　量入为出·量出为入
　　武汉制订财政概算
    【新华社汉口十四日电】武汉市人民政府以量入为出与量出为入的原则，制订一九五零年度财政收支概算。
    在收入方面，由中央供给的占百分之五十九点九四，地方收入占百分之四十点零六。支出方面：事业费占总概算额百分之四十八点二九，其中最大支出是企业投资，占百分之十四点六四；教育事业费，占百分之八点五四；工程建设费占总额百分之七点八六。其余是行政事业费、房屋修建费、水利事业费、卫生事业费、农业事业费等各项支出。各种事业费均经反复周密计划，根据轻重缓急而后核定；如民政事业费、教育事业费、卫生事业费三项，就比各部门原来提的预算要紧缩百分之五十七以上；而其中必需要用的如社会救济费、市民防疫费等不可省的则均按原预算支付。
    该项概算已经由于本月二日至七日举行的武汉市第三次各界人民代表会议一致通过，各界代表一致表示深切拥护。工人、青年和妇女代表对于政府在财政困难情况下仍决定支拨百分之八点五四的教育事业费，表示十分满意。工人代表提出愿以提高劳动热忱、发展生产、厉行节约，保证政府概算的彻底执行。金融界代表认为这个概算确已照顾了人民的负担，在支出方面实际上由人民负担的附加税收只占百分之十八左右；在支出方面，行政费只占百分之三十九点五七，这与国民党反动统治时代行政费常占全部开支的百分之七、八十不可同日而语。按这个概算，每个政府工作人员，薪给制的每月收入不过两担多米，供给制的还不到一担米，其克己奉公精神可见。其他各项事业费也都是为了人民的利益而支出。工商界人士表示愿以全力支持这个概算的执行，完成概算所列的各项纳税任务。
