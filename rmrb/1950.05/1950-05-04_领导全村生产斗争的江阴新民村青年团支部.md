The Communist Youth League Branch of Xinmin Village, Jiangyin, Leads the Whole Village in Production Struggle
    China Youth Society

    Xinmin Village in Changjing District, Jiangyin County, Southern Jiangsu Province, has more than 230 households, with a population of 1,134, including 274 young men and women.

    Since liberation, through movements like the summer grain requisition, flood prevention and disaster relief, and suppression of bandits and special agents last year, the masses' awareness has gradually increased. Youth activists Wang Longbao, Su Zhongliang, and others initiated the organization of the farmers' association. Last September, during the struggle against Zou Naixiang, the pseudo-chief of the bao, who was hated by the masses in the village, a large number of young activists emerged, nine of whom were approved to join the Communist Youth League. Subsequently, another twenty members were recruited during the victorious anti-despot struggle, establishing the League branch.

    After the establishment of the League branch, it mobilized League members and youth, leading the peasants to smoothly launch the rent reduction movement. When the rent reduction movement in the neighboring village stalled, the League branch of Xinmin Village assisted them in achieving victory. From then on, the League began to establish prestige among the masses.

    During the autumn grain requisition, under the slogan of "paying the liberation grain," the League members took the lead in promoting the task. More than 130,000 jin of public grain were completed in half a day. At the beginning of the grain delivery, League members and the majority of the masses had cleaned the public grain, but some middle peasants were unwilling to deliver good grain. The League members held a meeting to discuss how to unite the middle peasants to deliver good grain together. Finally, everyone agreed to take out the public grain they had prepared to winnow it again. The middle peasants saw it and were very surprised, saying, "You are already very clean, why do you still winnow?" The League members told him, "Now we are handing over public grain to our own government, the cleaner the better." Then, the League members went to help the middle peasants clean up the grain. The middle peasants were very moved and also cleaned the public grain.

    The landlords and rich peasants in the village were not enthusiastic about handing over public grain. The League branch mobilized League members and the masses to help them carry and deliver the grain. At first, the League members and the masses were unwilling. The cadres of the League branch persuaded everyone: "If we put in some effort to help them carry grain, it is actually assisting the government to complete the grain requisition task as soon as possible, which is good for all of us. Don't let the landlords and rich peasants use this as an excuse to delay the public grain."

    After the public grain was stored in the warehouse, the League members actively responded to the government's call and took the lead in guarding the public grain.

    Through everyone's efforts, Xinmin Village was selected as the top model village for grain delivery in the whole area. The League's prestige has also been improved. The masses said: "The Communist Youth League are the most enthusiastic in doing things." Everyone takes striving to join the League as an honor. The number of League members has increased from 29 to 47, and 15 League friends have been recruited. More than half of them are from poor peasant backgrounds, some are middle peasants, and one is an intellectual from a rich peasant background.

    In early winter last year, a winter school was established in the village. At this time, the League members who had been trained in the county returned, bringing back the government's call for production and conservation. The League members discussed production and conservation issues with the masses in the winter school. At first, some of the masses thought that they had food to eat and did not care much about production and conservation; some thought, "Our lives are already very hard, and we haven't added new clothes for several years. How else can we save?" Therefore, the League members carefully studied the instructions of the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office on production and conservation, and while publicizing the disaster situation in Southern Jiangsu to the masses, they also led everyone to calculate carefully, and found that the village's grain was not enough. At the same time, they pointed out some wasteful things in the village, such as always hiring monks and Taoists to play and sing at funerals, and having a big meal; during the Lunar New Year, burning paper and lighting candles, which cost a lot. After the League members' publicity and persuasion, it has gradually had an impact on the masses. Two people died in the village. According to the old custom, each person would cost more than ten dan of rice, but this time it only cost more than two dan of rice.

    At the same time as conservation, the League members also discussed wasteland reclamation with the masses. Bao Gencai, a loafer in the village, said, "The land reform is coming soon, why ruin the land and not divide the good fields? Let's wait!" The League members patiently publicized the production policy and took the lead in reclaiming wasteland, opening up 32 mu of wasteland, which was distributed to the poor families who had worked hard.

    The League members also initiated the organization of the village's cooperative, which earned more than 40 dan of rice by the end of the year; they added shares and bought a water pumping machine, contracting the water pumping work for 800 mu of paddy fields. Before the spring plowing, the machine was also used to grind flour.

    In previous years, the farmers in the village always played for a long time after the Lunar New Year before going to the fields to work. Everyone did not pay much attention to the wheat harvest, only hoping for the autumn harvest. This year, the situation is different. Under the call of the farmers' association and the leadership of the League members, everyone went to the fields after the festival and had already loosened the wheat once and thinned it once. The children also organized a grass cutting team to cut grass in the fields and compost it as fertilizer; the adults dredged river mud. League members went out early and returned late, increasing from dredging 20 boats per day to 25 boats. The League members also discussed with the farmers' association and the masses to increase sideline income, mobilizing everyone to raise 18,000 fish and plant 400 mulberry trees; in addition, they also planted several hundred "tangzi" pumpkins, which are estimated to yield 700 or 800 dan, which can replace part of the grain. The cooperative also lent some capital to the poor households in the village to engage in small businesses such as selling salt, grinding tofu, and selling soy sauce, which solved the living difficulties of some people.

    In the past, the rich and middle peasants who hired farm workers to cultivate land were not very motivated to produce this year and did not hire workers. After the League branch and the farmers' association asked the higher authorities for instructions, they explained the land reform policy to the rich and middle peasants respectively, dispelling their worries, and continued to hire workers to cultivate land, so that the sixteen farm workers in the village also solved their living difficulties.

    During the spring famine, there were still some households in the village who were relatively poor, and the League branch introduced them to work as temporary workers in the town. Now, the lives of all the farmers in the village are properly guaranteed.

    In terms of learning, the League members are also not lagging behind. They study together with the masses in the winter school. From the beginning to the end of the winter school, more than 80 people regularly attend school. An old man in the village in his fifties also studied with the young people for more than four months without interruption for a single day.

    In addition, in production, the League branch also reformed more than a dozen loafers in the village. The masses reported: In the past, we managed them very strictly, but they still gambled and ate as usual; after the education of the Communist Youth League, those who gambled stopped gambling, those who ate stopped eating, and they were also enthusiastic about farming. The Communist Youth League is really capable.

    Because the League members consult with the masses everywhere, the relationship between the League and the masses is very close. Many League members have been supported by the masses and elected as cadres: Wang Longbao became the mayor of the town, Su Zhongliang and Gong Rongsheng became the chairman and vice-chairman of the farmers' association, Wu Yulin and Wang Yonglin became the village chief, and Yan Zhenqing and Mao Jianqing became the captain and squad leader of the militia. They are uniting and leading the vast number of young people and the masses in the whole village to carry forward the previous advantages, overcome the shortcomings in their work, and move forward under the leadership of the Party and the government.

　　领导全村生产斗争的江阴新民村青年团支部
    中国青年社
    苏南区江阴县长泾区新民村，全村有二百三十多户，一千一百三十四口人，男女青年共二百七十四名。
    解放以后，经过去年的夏季征粮、防水救灾、剿匪肃特等运动，群众的觉悟逐渐提高。青年积极分子王龙宝、苏中亮等发起组织了农会。去年九月，在斗争村里群众所一致痛恨的伪保长邹乃相时，涌现了大批青年积极分子，其中有九个被批准加入了青年团。此后，又在胜利的反恶霸斗争中吸收了二十个团员。建立了团支部。
    团支部成立之后，它发动团员和青年，带领农民，顺利地展开了减租运动。邻村的减租运动搞不开，新民村的团支部便协助他们取得了胜利。从此，团在群众中开始建立了威信。
    秋季征粮时，全村在“缴纳翻身粮”的口号下，由团员带头推动，十三万多斤公粮，半天内就完成了任务。交粮开始时，团员和大多数群众都把公粮晒扬干净了，只有个别中农不愿交好粮食。团员们便开会研究，如何团结中农一道交好公粮。最后大家同意把自己预备交的公粮拿出来再扬一次。中农看见很奇怪，说：“你们已经很干净，为什么还要扬？”团员们就告诉他：“现在交公粮是交给自己政府，越干净越好。”接着，团员们又去帮助中农收拾粮食。中农很感动，也把公粮晒扬干净了。
    村里地主、富农交公粮不起劲，团支部就发动团员和群众帮助他们挑送。起初团员和群众不愿意，团支部的干部就说服大家：“我们出点力，帮助他们挑粮实际上是协助政府早些完成征粮任务，对我们都有好处。不要让地主富农借口拖欠下公粮。”
    公粮入仓以后，团员们又积极响应政府的号召，带头去看管公粮。
    经过大家的努力，新民村被选为全区的头等交粮模范村。团的威信也提高了，群众说：“青年团都是最热心做事的。”人人以争取入团为光荣。团员由二十九人发展到了四十七人，又吸收了十五名团友。他们半数以上是贫农成份，一部分是中农，有一个是富农出身的知识分子。
    去年初冬，村里成立了冬学。这时，村里赴县受训的团员回来了，带回了政府生产节约的号召。团员们便在冬学里和群众讨论生产节约问题。起初，有的群众以为自己有饭吃，对生产节约不很关心；有的以为“我们生活已经很苦了，几年都没有添新衣服，还要怎样节约呢？”于是团员们仔细研究了苏南行署关于生产节约的指示，一面向群众宣传苏南地区的灾荒情况，一面又领导大家算细账，结果发现全村粮食还不够。同时，又指出村里一些浪费的事情，例如办丧事总要请和尚道士吹吹打打，大吃大喝一场；过旧历年时，烧纸点烛，花费很大等。经过团员的宣传说服，在群众中已逐渐发生影响。村上死了两个人，照旧风俗每人要花十多石米的，这次只花了两石多米。
    与节约同时，团员又和群众商议开荒。村里的二流子包根才说：“就要土地改革了，何必弄坏地不分好田。等着吧！”团员们又耐心宣传生产政策，并带头开荒。开出了三十二亩荒地，分给了出了力而又贫苦的人家种。
    团员们又发起组织了村里的合作社，到年底赚了四十多石稻子；他们又添股买了一架打水机，包了八百亩水田的打水工作。在春耕前，并利用这部机器磨面。
    往年，村里农民过了旧历年总要玩一个很长的时期才下田做活。大家对麦收不很重视，只指望着大秋。今年情形不同了，在农会号召和团员带头之下，过了节大家就下田，已经把麦子撩了一次，削了一次。孩子们也组织了割草队，到野外割草沤肥；大人们则捞河泥，团员们早出晚归，由每天捞二十船增加到廿五船。团员们又和农会与群众商议增加副业收入，发动大家养了一万八千条鱼、种了四百棵桑树；此外，还种了几百“堂子”南瓜，估计可收七、八百石，能代替一部分粮食。合作社又借给村里贫苦户一部分本钱，从事贩盐、磨豆腐、卖酱油等小生意，解决了一些人的生活困难。
    往年雇工种田的富农和中农，今年生产情绪不高，都不雇工了。团支部和农会向上级请示之后，就对富农和中农分别解释土地改革政策，打消了他们的顾虑，继续雇工种地。使村里十六个雇工也解决了生活困难。
    春荒中，村里还有若干户比较困难，团支部又介绍他们到镇上去作临时工。现在，全村农民的生活都有了适当保障。
    在学习上，团员们也不落后。他们和群众一块在冬学里学习。从冬学开办到结束，经常上学的有八十多个人。村里一位五十多岁的老头，也和青年们一块学习了四个多月，一天也没有间断。
    此外，在生产中，团支部还改造了村里十几个二流子。群众反映：过去我们管得很严，他们还是照常赌、照常吃；经过青年团一教育，赌的不赌了，吃的不吃了，种田也起劲了。青年团真有办法。
    由于团员处处和群众商量，团和群众的关系非常密切，许多团员受群众拥戴被选为干部：王龙宝当了镇长，苏中亮、贡荣生当了农会正副会长，吴预林、王永林当了村长，严镇庆、茅鉴清当了民兵中队长和分队长。他们正团结、领导着全村广大青年与群众，在党与政府的领导下发扬以前的优点，克服工作中的缺点，迈步前进。
