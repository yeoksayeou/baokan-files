Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th. In order to strengthen business ties between public and private financial institutions, encourage private banks to absorb large amounts of idle social capital to support productive enterprises beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and to help private banks and businesses in Tianjin solve the difficulties of loans becoming stagnant due to the slow sales of private industrial and commercial products, the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China signed a business contact contract with the Tianjin Banking Consortium on the 4th of this month. The contract stipulates that the Banking Consortium should deposit 10% of the total amount of deposits of all its members in the previous month (increasing by 5% each month thereafter) with the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China as the minimum amount for joint lending, which will be lent out successively. This deposit will enjoy a preferential rate of interest, being the one-month fixed deposit rate of the bank plus 20%. The contract is valid for three months, starting from this month. The 6.56 billion yuan that the consortium should jointly lend this month was fully deposited into the Tianjin Branch on the 5th and the first batch of 3 billion yuan was lent to Yongli Company the next day to help the company purchase raw materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 10th. The Wuhan Joint Lending Office, led by the Hankou Branch of the People's Bank of China and composed of private banks and money shops in the city, has gradually developed its business, playing a role in guiding idle capital into production and supporting private industry.

From its establishment on March 20th to May 8th, the total amount of loans approved by the Joint Lending Office increased from 3 billion yuan to 16 billion yuan. Of this, one-eighth was the capital of the People's Bank of China, and the remainder was capital invested by private banks and money shops in the city, accounting for 20% to 30% of their deposit balances. To date, there have been 16 large loans, with a cumulative loan amount of 9.382225 billion yuan. Excluding those that have been repaid on schedule, the funds currently circulating in production amount to 5.1735 billion yuan. The loan recipients are private textile, chemical, and flour industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The units that have received loans include the four major private yarn factories, Yuhua, Shenxin, Zhenhuan, and No. 1, as well as Kaiming Enterprise Company, Hanchang Chemical Industry Company, and Shengxin Flour Company. This loan has played a significant role in helping private industry overcome the difficulty of insufficient working capital in production.

The loan provided by the office is a one-month fixed-term collateral loan with guaranteed credit, so private banks and money shops are very willing to invest funds in production through the Joint Lending Office. At the same time, because the lending period of the office is relatively long, the number of factories applying for loans is increasing day by day.

    【新华社天津十日电】中国人民银行天津分行为了加强公私营金融企业的业务联系，鼓励私营银行大量吸收社会游资用以扶持有益于国计民生之生产事业，帮助津市私营行庄解决因私营工商业产品滞销致贷款陷于呆滞的困难，特于本月四日与天津市银行业联合银团签订业务联系合同。合同规定银行业联合银团每月应以其全体会员上月存款总额的百分之十（以后逐月增加百分之五）存于人民银行天津分行，作为联合贷放最低金额，陆续贷放。该项存款得享受该行一月期定期存款利率加二成之优待。合同有效期间定为三个月，自本月起开始执行。本月份银团应联合贷放的六十五亿六千万元，已于五日全部存入天津分行，并已于次日首批贷给永利公司三十亿元，扶助该公司购买原料。
    【新华社汉口十日电】中国人民银行汉口分行领导全市私营银钱业所组成的武汉市联合放款处，业务渐获开展，对引导游资投入生产，扶助私营工业起了作用。
    联合放款处从三月二十日成立到五月八日止，核定放款总额由三十亿元增加到一百六十亿元。其中除八分之一是人民银行的资金外，余均为全市私营银钱业以其存款余额百分之二十到三十所投放的资金。至目前止，大宗放款已有十六笔，放款累计数已达九十三亿八千二百二十二万五千元。除已如期收回的以外，正在生产中周转的资金达五十一亿七千三百五十万元。贷款对象均为有利于国计民生的私营纺织、化学、面粉等工业。获得贷款的单位计有私营裕华、申新、震寰、第一等四大纱厂，及开明企业公司、汉昌化学工业公司、胜新面粉公司。该项贷款对帮助私营工业克服生产中流动资金不足的困难，起了很大作用。
    该处贷款是一个月的定期质押放款，信用有保障，因此私营银钱业均十分愿意通过联合放款处将资金投入生产。同时因该处的放款期限较长，所以申请贷款的工厂日益增多。
