    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd] The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission sent a telegram on the 21st to Generals Chen Yi, Su Yu, Rao Shushi, and Tan Zhenlin of the East China Military Region and all the officers and soldiers on the front lines, congratulating them on the liberation of the Zhoushan Islands. The full text of the telegram is as follows: Comrades Chen Yi, Su Yu, Rao Shushi, and Tan Zhenlin of the East China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all the officers and soldiers on the front lines in Zhejiang:
    Our People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang front, with the vigorous support of the people, landed on Zhoushan Island on the 17th of this month and completed the liberation of the Zhoushan Islands on the 18th. This victory shattered the plan of the remnant bandits in Taiwan to use the Zhoushan Islands as a base to blockade, bomb, and harass East China, and further created conditions for the liberation of Taiwan. We extend our warm congratulations to you and hope that all the officers and soldiers in East China and the people of the whole country will continue to work actively and strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the complete elimination of all remnant bandits.
