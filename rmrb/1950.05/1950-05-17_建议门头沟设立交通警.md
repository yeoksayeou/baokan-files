　　Suggestion to Establish Traffic Police in Mentougou
    Mentougou is an industrial and mining area with a lot of vehicles and pedestrians. It is hoped that the Beijing Public Security Bureau will establish traffic police officers there to direct vehicles and pedestrians and protect traffic safety.

　　建议门头沟设立交通警
    门头沟是工矿区，往来的车辆、行人很多。希望北京市公安局在那儿设立交通警士来指挥车辆及行人，保护交通安全。
