Qinling Forest Area Seriously Damaged
Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Department Actively Planning Forest Protection

[By Our Correspondent Lin Wei] This newspaper’s special correspondent Lin Wei reports: The Qinling forest area, renowned in the Northwest, has suffered significant damage due to the local government's inadequate management and protection. The Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Department is actively seeking ways to stop this and investigate responsibility. The Qinling Mountains stretch from western Henan in the east to eastern Gansu in the west, from the Han River in the south to the Wei River in the north. They are approximately 900 li long from east to west and 500 li wide from north to south. The mountains span 28 counties, including Longxian, Baoji, and Chang'an, and are a well-known forest area in the Northwest. According to an August 1946 report from the Qinling State-owned Forest Area Management Office under the puppet Agricultural and Forestry Department, the forest area covers nearly 40,000 square li in just six forest areas in western Qinling: Xiaolongshan, Qingfengshan, West Taibai Mountain, South Wutai, Xinjiashan, and central Fo(ping)-Ning(shan). This accounts for one-third of the total area of the six forest areas, which is 120,000 square li. The timber reserves are over 1.7 billion cubic feet. The tree species include dozens of varieties of pine, fir, oak, birch, beech, lacquer, aspen, and willow. For many years, the forests in this area have suffered from indiscriminate logging and burning by the Kuomintang bandit troops and local people. By the time of liberation last year, some forests were nearly destroyed. After liberation, the People's Government established the Qinling Forest Farm, specializing in protection and planned logging. However, due to the small number of personnel, the management scope was limited to the Xiaolongshan forest area where the forest farm was located. Other forest areas were managed by nearby county, district, and township governments. These local governments generally lacked a sense of responsibility for this enormous national wealth. Furthermore, they were busy with other work and had not seriously managed the area, simply dispatching some former forest police who followed past practices and acted carelessly, with very little oversight from Party and government cadres. Taking the South Wutai scenic forest area under the jurisdiction of Chang'an County as an example, the destructive behavior of the masses has continued since liberation. In September and December of last year, the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Department twice notified the Chang'an County Government to instruct the farmers' associations in the vicinity of Wangqu to assist in forest protection. In November, the Northwest Military Region and the former Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government also issued a proclamation strictly prohibiting indiscriminate logging. However, destructive behavior continued to occur.
	
	Only in Chang'an County, 50,000 Trees Were Destroyed
On February 13th and March 18th of this year, the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Department again notified the Chang'an County Government twice to promptly dispatch cadres to the scene to stop the destruction and hold the perpetrators accountable according to the law. However, the county still did not pay attention and did not report even once. After March 21st, the surrounding masses even more organizedly entered the mountains for large-scale logging, first "pulling out the big hairs" and then "shaving the head bald," day and night without stopping. It was not until two cadres specially dispatched by the Agricultural and Forestry Department arrived at the scene on April 7th that the large-scale destruction was temporarily stopped. According to reports from local farmers' associations and monks, at least 200 people were entering the mountains to cut down trees every day at that time. Since the New Year's Day, at least 50,000 trees had been destroyed, resulting in a loss of 1.5 billion yuan at 30,000 yuan per tree. The local county and district governments have an extremely vague understanding of this enormous loss to the country. They emphasized that felling trees for firewood was a way to provide production and disaster relief (quite a few county governments had suggested to the commissioner's office and the Agricultural and Forestry Department that this be used as a way to provide production and disaster relief). However, they did not consider that the loss caused by this unplanned and unled indiscriminate logging was much greater than the cost of providing disaster relief with money, and the effect was much smaller. Moreover, a considerable portion of the profits fell into the hands of timber merchants, which in turn hurt the sales of public timber (the Qinling Forest Farm currently has a large number of paving stones that cannot be sold). This erroneous thinking has caused them to relax their forest protection efforts. When cadres from the Agricultural and Forestry Department inspected the Chang'an County Government's implementation of the forest protection notices, they could not even find the notices. It was clear that they did not take forest protection seriously. This situation exists in the other 20-plus counties around the Qinling Mountains.
	
	Continuous Destruction in the Xiaolongshan Forest Area
The Xiaolongshan forest area, where the Qinling Forest Farm is located, has also been suffering from continuous destruction. Since January, in addition to the general public, troops building the Baoji-Tianshui Road and the Baoji Military Sub-district armed forces engaged in organ production have entered the mountains to fell trees. The troops needed a large amount of firewood, and the road construction required a large number of buildings and equipment. The required timber should have been taken from this mountain, but many troops did not selectively thin out the trees in a planned and guided manner, but instead indiscriminately felled trees near the mountains where the trees were sparse. They cut down many small trees that were still growing, inevitably causing the forest to diminish in size and head towards destruction. According to a review by comrades from the Forestry Bureau of the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Department and the director of the Qinling Forest Farm, they themselves had not paid attention to these phenomena in the past. Their thinking was: "A forest that grows naturally is not bought with money. What's the big deal if everyone cuts down a few trees! Besides, the troops are building roads and stationed here, which are legitimate uses. Why interfere or ask questions?" It was not until the Central Forest and Land Reclamation Department inquired about the destruction situation in mid-April that they felt the problem was serious and began to actively conduct on-site inspections, stop the destruction, investigate, and review.

The Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Department's Forestry Bureau is now actively planning to establish management offices in the Qilian Mountains in Qinghai, the Diemang Mountains in Gansu, and the major forest areas in the Qinling Mountains. It will also first build twelve stations and sixteen sentry posts on the northern slope of the Qinling Mountains. Forest protection committees will be established in county and district governments, mass forest protection groups will be established in villages and towns, and special forest police will be hired. A circular will be issued to all localities, strictly prohibiting any government agencies or units from engaging in indiscriminate logging under any pretext. If it is necessary, it must be approved by the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and even the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Department, and personnel will be dispatched to supervise and guide. Recently, many units have requested to use logging as a means of organ production, but these requests have been rejected. However, they are allowed to participate in the forest farm's planned logging labor and receive a certain remuneration.

　　秦岭林区遭严重破坏
　　西北农林部正积极筹划护林
    【本报讯】本报特派记者林韦报导：驰名西北的秦岭林区，因当地政府管理保护不力，遭受了重大的破坏。西北农林部正积极设法制止，并追查责任。秦岭东起豫西，西至陇东，南至汉江，北至渭水。东西长约九百里，南北宽约五百里。山峦横亘陇县、宝鸡、长安等二十八县。为西北著名森林区。据伪农林部所属秦岭国有林区管理处一九四六年八月报告，仅秦岭西部小陇山、青峰山、西太白山、南五台、辛家山及中部佛（坪）宁（陕）等六个林区统计，森林面积即近四万方里，占六个林区总面积十二万方里的三分之一；木材蓄积量在十七亿立方市尺以上。树种有各类松、杉、橡、桦、榉、漆、山杨、山柳等数十种。多年以来，该区森林遭受国民党匪军及当地群众滥伐、烧垦，至去年解放时，若干森林已近毁灭。解放后，人民政府设立了秦岭林场，专事保护与计划采伐；但因人员太少，管理范围仅限于林场所在地之小陇山林区。其他林区均交由附近县区乡政府管理。上述地方政府对此巨大的国家财富，一般缺乏责任感，加以其他工作较忙，一直没有认真看管，只是派遣了一些旧林警，按照过去习惯，马虎从事，党政干部极少过问。拿长安县属南五台风景林说，解放以来，群众破坏森林的行为就一直继续着。去年九月与十二月，西北农林部曾先后两次通知长安县府转令该县王曲附近各乡农会协助护林。十一月，西北军区与前陕甘宁边区政府也颁发布告，严禁滥伐。但破坏行为仍继续发生。
            仅长安县境内即破坏五万株
    今年二月十三、三月十八两日，西北农林部又两次通知长安县府迅派干员赴现场制止，对破坏分子追究法办。但该县仍不注意，也没报告过一次。三月二十一日以后，附近群众更有组织地入山大伐，先“拔大毛”，再“剃光头”，日夜不息。直至农林部专派干部二人于四月七日赶赴现场，才暂时制止了大规模的破坏。据当地农会与和尚反映，当时每天入山砍伐的至少有二百人；元旦以来，被毁树木至少在五万株以上。每株以三万元计，损失十五亿元。对于国家此种巨大的损失，当地县区政府认识极为模糊。他们强调伐树采薪是生产救灾（好些县府都曾经过专署向农林部建议以此做为生产救灾之道），但不考虑这种无计划、无领导的滥伐滥砍所造成的损失，要比我们拿出钱来救灾的费用大得多，效果小得多。而且其中有相当部分落入了木商之手，结果就打击了公家木材的销路（秦岭林场现有大批道板卖不出去）。这种错误想法，使他们放松了森林保护工作。农林部干部检查长安县府对历次护林通知的执行情形时，他们连通知都找不到。显然是根本没把护林当成一件事。这种情形在秦岭周围的其他二十多县同样存在着。
            小陇山林区内也遭不断破坏
    秦岭林场所在的小陇山林区，也一直遭受着不断的破坏。一月份以来，除了一般群众以外，还有修建宝（鸡）天（水）路的军队、和进行机关生产的宝鸡军分区武装，入山伐木。部队需要大量烧薪，修路需要建制大量房屋器具，所需木材，应该取给于该山；但好些部队不是有计划、有领导的选择地区、树种，进行修枝间伐，而是在山边树木稀疏之处，就近滥伐。把许多正在生长的小树砍了。这就使森林不可免的由大而小，走向毁灭。据西北农林部林业局同志及秦岭林场场长自己检讨，他们本身过去对这些现象也是不注意的。他们的想法是：“天然长起来的一片树林，又不是花钱买的，大家砍伐一些，有什么了不起！况且部队在这里修路、驻防，都是正用，何必干涉过问？”直至中央林垦部四月中旬来电查询破坏情况，才感到问题严重，开始积极实地视察，制止，追查，检讨。
    现在西北农林部林业局正积极筹划在青海祁连山、甘肃叠岷山及秦岭各大林区建立管理处。并在秦岭北坡先建十二个站，十六个哨。在县区政府建立护林委员会，乡村建立群众性的护林小组，聘特约林警。并将通令各地，严禁任何机关单位以任何借口进行滥伐。如有必需，须经省农林厅以至西北农林部批准，并派人监督指导。最近有不少单位请求以伐木做机关生产，都已驳回。但允许参加林场有计划的伐木劳动，取得一定报酬。
