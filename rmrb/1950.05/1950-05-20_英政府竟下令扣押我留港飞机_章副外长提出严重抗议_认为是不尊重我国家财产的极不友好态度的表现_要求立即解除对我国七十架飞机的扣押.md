Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The British government, on May 10th, ordered the Hong Kong authorities to seize seventy aircraft belonging to the China and Central Aviation Companies under the Civil Aviation Administration of China, which were parked at Kai Tak Airport. The British government has previously stated its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, but it shows no respect for our national property in Hong Kong. Seventy of our aircraft remained in Hong Kong, and several of them suffered damage from bandits due to the Hong Kong British authorities' failure to provide protection. Now, the British government has ordered their seizure. Regarding this extremely unfriendly act by the British government, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a strong protest. The full text of the protest is as follows:

Mr. Hu Jiechen, Representative:

I received your letter No. 28 on May 11th, along with the full text of the "1950 Privy Council Order on the Jurisdiction of the Hong Kong Supreme Court" issued by the British government on May 10th and the official statement regarding the Privy Council Order. On the same day, according to Hong Kong reports, the Hong Kong Supreme Court has ordered the seizure of seventy aircraft belonging to the China and Central Aviation Companies under the Civil Aviation Administration of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which are parked at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport.

These aircraft are the state property of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China will not allow anyone to interfere with, damage, destroy, or transfer them under any pretext. The British government has been repeatedly notified of this. Since the British government has declared its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, it should fully respect the state property of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The current act of the British government in seizing the state property of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China not only shows the British government's lack of respect for the state property of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, but also represents an extremely unfriendly attitude towards the People's Republic of China.

Therefore, I hereby lodge a strong protest with the British government and request that you convey to the British government the demand to immediately lift the seizure of the seventy aircraft of the China and Central Aviation Companies.

Respectfully,

Zhang Hanfu
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
May 17, 1950, in Beijing.

　　英政府竟下令扣押我留港飞机
　　章副外长提出严重抗议
    认为是不尊重我国家财产的极不友好态度的表现       
    要求立即解除对我国七十架飞机的扣押
    【新华社十九日讯】英国政府于五月十日命令香港当局扣押我民航局所属中国、中央两航空公司停放在启德机场的七十架飞机。查英国政府曾宣称愿与我中华人民共和国建立外交关系，但对我国在港国家财产毫不尊重。我留港飞机七十架，前曾因香港英国当局未负责保护，致多架遭受匪徒破坏。现在英政府竟又下令扣押。对英政府此种极不友好的行为，我外交部章汉夫副部长特提出严重抗议。抗议全文如下：胡阶森代表先生：
    五月十一日接先生第二十八号来函，并附来英国政府五月十日发出的“一九五零年枢密院对香港最高法院（司法权限）法令”及有关该枢密院法令的官方声明的全文。同日据香港确报，香港最高法院已下令将中华人民共和国中央人民政府民航局所属中国、中央两航空公司停放在香港启德机场的七十架飞机，加以扣押。
    查此项飞机为中华人民共和国中央人民政府的国家财产，中华人民共和国中央人民政府决不容许任何人以任何借口加以干涉、损毁、破坏、转移，前经一再通知英国政府在案。英国政府既然宣称愿与中华人民共和国中央人民政府建立外交关系，则对于中华人民共和国中央人民政府的国家财产，便应当充分予以尊重。现在英国政府这种扣押中华人民共和国中央人民政府国家财产的行为，不仅表示英国政府对于中华人民共和国中央人民政府的国家财产毫不尊重，而且更是对中华人民共和国极不友好的态度的表现。
    为此，我特向英国政府提出严重抗议，请先生转达英国政府立即解除对中国、中央两航空公司的七十架飞机的扣押。
    专此布达，顺致敬意。
            中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部副部长  章汉夫
                      一九五○年五月十七日于北京。
