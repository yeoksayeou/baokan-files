Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The peace signature movement is vigorously unfolding in countries such as France, Finland, Lebanon, Austria, and Switzerland. Compiled from TASS dispatches: The campaign to collect signatures for the declaration (previously translated as appeal) of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace is underway among the broad strata of the French people. Ninety-eight percent of the residents of eighteen cities in the Gard province and seventy percent of the residents of the city of "Ivry-sur-Seine," with a population of 42,000, have signed the declaration. Women are riding bicycles to visit villages without women's federation branches to collect signatures. In Chabanais-Canton in the Charente province, almost all the residents of almost all villages have signed. Ninety-eight percent of the railway workers in Chateauroux in the Indre province and ninety-five percent of the postal and telecommunications staff, and all the workers in the clothing factory in Gaillard, Corrèze province, have signed the declaration.

Many social leaders in France have already participated in the signing, such as Benoît, chairman of the National Federation of Food Cooperatives, Canonici, Director-General of the General Agricultural Association, Abati, Secretary-General of the National Federation of Farmers and Tenant Farmers, members of the National Assembly, professors at the University of Paris, and many mayors and deputy mayors of the Somme province. In addition, pastors, Catholics, lawyers, judges, doctors, engineers, and famous athletes have signed. The provincial councils of Isère, Loire, and Alpes provinces and the municipal councils of six cities in Corrèze province have unanimously expressed their support for the declaration of the World Peace Council.

In Finland, after the joint delegation of the "Finnish Peace Supporters" organization and the Standing Committee of the Finnish Congress of Peace Supporters submitted a peace declaration signed by 270,000 people to the Finnish National Assembly, it continued to expand this mass peace signature movement. The Finnish People's Democratic League faction, led by Herta Kuusinen, Executive Committee member of the Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party, has called for securing at least one million signatures out of the country's four million population.

The peace signature movement in Lebanon, with the active support of the Lebanese Democratic Lawyers League, the Association for the Protection of Women's Rights, and the Federation of Democratic Trade Unions, has been enthusiastically responded to by the broad masses of working people. By the 16th, 14,000 signatures had been collected. Students at Beirut University in the capital have issued a statement denouncing the imperialists' conspiracy to prepare for a new war, expressing their support for the declaration of the World Peace Council. Prior to this, a joint delegation of the Lebanese Federation of Democratic Trade Unions, the Association for the Protection of Women's Rights, and other democratic groups submitted a letter signed by 6,000 people to the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament on April 21, demanding peace and opposing the transformation of Lebanon into a strategic base for imperialists.

In Austria, since the launch of the peace signature movement, within five days, more than 50,000 residents of Vienna and tens of thousands of peace supporters in other regions have participated in the signing.

The peace signature movement in Switzerland has also been launched nationwide. In Zurich alone, under the initiative of the Swiss Free Youth Organization, more than 3,000 signatures have been quickly collected.
