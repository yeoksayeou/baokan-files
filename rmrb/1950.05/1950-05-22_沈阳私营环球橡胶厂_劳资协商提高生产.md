Shenyang Private Huanqiu Rubber Factory
    Labor-Management Consultation Increases Production
    [Shenyang News] According to the Shenyang Daily, since the Shenyang private Huanqiu Rubber Factory began operations last "May Day," there has not been a single labor-management dispute. Even when difficulties arise, labor and management can jointly find ways to overcome them. The factory's business is progressing. The number of workers has increased from 18 in May of last year to 86 now. The daily output of the main product, rubber shoes, has increased from four or five dozen in May of last year to 40 dozen now. The quality of the rubber shoes is such that they "do not come unglued and the soles do not break," and 99% are first-class products. This is the result of labor and management "equal consultation" to improve production.
    Initially, the factory did not have a labor-management consultation organization. When problems arose, both sides discussed them at any time. Last November, due to the off-season and poor sales, coupled with a cracked steam pot, the factory faced many difficulties. At this time, labor and management agreed to establish a "Production Discussion Conference" with representatives from both sides to jointly study ways to overcome the difficulties. This meeting solved two major problems: One was that the labor side took the initiative to propose that during the continued existence of difficulties, workers would uniformly receive half pay and eat coarse grains (rice changed to sorghum), and three meals a day would be reduced to two. The management was greatly moved by this and became more active in management, raising funds from all sides. Three months later, the factory overcame the difficulties. The other was that both sides discussed and found a way out, adapting to seasonal needs, changing from basketball shoes to cotton-padded shoes, which resulted in a large increase in sales and played a significant role in overcoming difficulties.
    Since the establishment of the labor-management consultation meeting at the Huanqiu Rubber Factory, in just one and a half months, the output of rubber shoes has increased from 20 dozen per day in March to 40 dozen per day now (with the same number of people). The quality of rubber shoes has increased from 90% first-class products in March to 99% first-class products now. Problems of uneven packaging and incorrect numbers of shoes have also been basically eliminated.
    The factory manager, Xue Peiyan, said when talking about the benefits of the labor-management consultation meeting that he had personally experienced: "Since the establishment of the consultation meeting, my spirit has been particularly happy! Because with the consultation meeting, everyone can think of ways to improve production. For example, the responsibility system, if it weren't for the workers to propose it, how could we have thought of it!"
    In March of this year, the rubber industry negotiated and concluded a labor-management collective contract, which gave the representatives of both labor and management attending the consultation meeting a lesson. They deeply realized that the consultation meeting format is the best way to solve labor-management problems. They also accepted the suggestion of worker Wang Qin Fang (who returned from studying at the Workers' Political School), and both sides voted to elect their own representatives (three official representatives and one alternate representative from each side). The labor-management consultation meeting was officially announced on April 4. From April 5 to now, three labor-management consultation meetings have been held, with both sides taking turns as chairman. Issues such as temporary workers, the adoption of production incentive methods, strengthening the inspection system, and establishing a handover responsibility system have been resolved.

### 沈阳私营环球橡胶厂  劳资协商提高生产

　　沈阳私营环球橡胶厂
    劳资协商提高生产
    【沈阳讯】据沈阳日报消息：沈阳私营环球橡胶厂从去年“五一”开工迄今，从没有发生过一次劳资纠纷，即使有了困难，也能由劳资双方共同设法克服。该厂营业日有进展。工人由去年五月的十八人增加到现在的八十六人；主要产品的胶鞋由去年五月的日产四、五打，提高到现在的日产四十打；胶鞋质量作到“不开胶不断底”，百分之九十九是一级品。这是劳资双方“平等协商”改进生产的结果。
    该厂起初并没有劳资协商的组织机构。有了问题，双方随时讨论。去年十一月，因淡月到来，销路不好，又遇上蒸锅鼓裂，工厂面临重重困难。这时劳资双方便同意成立一个由双方各选代表参加的“生产讨论会”，共同研究克服困难。这个会议先后解决了两大问题：一个是劳方主动提议：在困难继续存在期间，工人一律拿半薪，吃粗粮（大米改高粱米），由每日三顿饭改为两顿。资方因此大为感动，在经营上更加起劲，四出筹款。三个月后，工厂渡过了难关。再一个是双方互相讨论找出路，适应季节需要，由夹球鞋改作棉球鞋，结果销路大畅，对克服困难起了很大作用。
    环球橡胶工厂自从成立劳资协商会议后，仅一个半月时间，胶鞋产量由三月间日产二十打提高到现在日产四十打（人数相同），胶鞋质量由三月间百分之九十的一级品提高到现在百分之九十九的一级品；包装不均匀的毛病，鞋数差的毛病也都基本消灭了。
    该厂经理薛佩言，谈到他亲身体验到的劳资协商会议的好处时说：“从协商会议成立后，我的精神特别愉快！因为有了协商会，可以由大家想办法搞好生产。比方责任制吧，若不是工人来提议，咱哪想得到！
    今年三月间，橡胶业协商订立劳资集体合同，给该厂劳资双方出席协商会议的代表上了一课。他们深深认识到：协商会议形式是解决劳资问题的最好办法。又接受了工人王琴舫（从工人政治学校学习回来）的建议，双方便投票选出自己的代表（每方正式代表三人，候补代表一人），劳资协商会议遂于四月四日正式宣告成立。从四月五日到现在，先后召开劳资协商会议三次，双方轮流任主席。先后解决了临时工人，通过生产奖励法，加强检查制度，建立交接责任制等问题。
