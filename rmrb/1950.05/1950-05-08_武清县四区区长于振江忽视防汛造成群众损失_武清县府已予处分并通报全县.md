    Yu Zhenjiang, District Chief of the Fourth District of Wuqing County, Neglected Flood Control, Causing Losses to the People; Wuqing County Government Has Disciplined Him and Issued a Notice Throughout the County
    Comrade Editor:
    I am a villager from Wuqing County. I have a question and would like to ask you to answer it during your busy schedule:
    There is a Fengh River between Niuzhen Village and Tonglin Village in the Fourth District (formerly the Sixth District) of Wuqing County. Last August, the local area suffered severe rain damage. At that time, because the water outside the river was higher than the water inside the river, Niuzhen Village dug a dike to release water into the river. The breach was not blocked after the water was released. Later, because the water inside the river rose sharply, water flowed out from the original breach again, causing even more severe flooding, and it has not been blocked since. After last autumn's harvest, the wheat seeds lent by the government have been sown and the wheat seedlings are already tall. It looks like they will be harvested in just over a month. In this month's heavy rain, the water inside the river rose sharply again, and the wheat fields, covering more than 20 hectares, were flooded again by river water and rainwater. The lives of the affected villagers are now in a critical situation. Who should be held responsible for the failure to block the breach and the continuous suffering of such severe floods?
     Wuqing County Villager Liu Zhan'ao
    (Editor's Note: After receiving this letter, we immediately sent a letter to the Wuqing County People's Government to inquire. The following is the county government's reply.)
    Comrade Editor:
    Niuzhen Village, Fourth District (formerly Sixth District) of our county, suffered from rain damage in August 1949. The masses requested to dig a dike to discharge water into the Fengh River. At that time, Comrade Liu Shanqiao, the District Party Secretary, dug the dike to release water without the approval of higher authorities; the breach was not immediately blocked after the water was released. Later, the river water rose sharply and overflowed from the original breach, resulting in a disaster. At that time, the government immediately carried out emergency blocking and used 200 sacks and a number of wooden stakes of flood control materials stored by the county government. The county government made a serious criticism to the district government about this incident.
    At the end of the flood season in 1949, the county government telegraphed the district to raise and thicken the dike, but the district government dragged its feet and did not do so. This spring, the masses were afraid of spring floods and asked the district government to raise and thicken the dike, but the district chief said, "We will repair it after the spring plowing is over." In recent days, there has been continuous spring rain. The district government still did not pay enough attention to this problem, nor did it conduct timely inspections, which resulted in the river water overflowing again, flooding about 13 hectares of wheat fields. After the county government sent people to lead the blocking of the breach and drainage, 825 mu have been drained. The reasons for this incident, in addition to the county government's bureaucracy in leadership and insufficient in-depth inspection, are mainly due to the serious paralysis and carelessness of the district government, the irresponsibility to the masses, and the disregard for the instructions of the higher authorities. The county People's Government, in addition to giving the district chief Yu Zhenjiang a disciplinary warning, also issued a notice throughout the county to serve as a lesson.

　　武清县四区区长于振江忽视防汛造成群众损失
    武清县府已予处分并通报全县编辑同志：
    我是武清县一个乡民，有一个问题，请在百忙中答复一下：
    武清县北四区（原六区）牛镇村和桐林村中间有道凤河。去年八月间，当地受雨水灾害甚重，当时因河外水比河内水高，由牛镇村掘堤往河内放水，放水后缺口未堵；后因河内水猛涨，又由原缺口出水，重淹更重，以后还未堵塞。在去年秋收后，由政府贷给的麦种已经种好，麦苗也很高，眼看再有一个多月就能收了。在本月这次大雨中，河内的水又猛涨，又被河水及雨水淹没了小麦田二十余顷。现该地受灾的乡民生活，实在危急。缺口未堵，连续遭受这样大的水灾事件，应由谁负此责任！

    （编者按：我们接到此信后，即致函武清县人民政府查询，下面是县政府的复信。）
    编辑同志：
    我县四区（原六区）牛镇村于一九四九年八月间因雨水成灾，群众要求挖堤向凤河泄水。当时区委书记刘善桥同志，未经上级批准，即掘堤放水；放水后又未立刻将缺口堵好。后来，河水猛涨，由原口外溢，以致成灾。当时政府即进行抢堵，并用去县政府所存防汛材料麻袋二百条，木桩若干根。县政府对这一事件，曾对该区政府提出严重批评。
    一九四九年汛末，县政府曾电示该区加高培厚，但该区政府始终拖拉未作。今春，群众怕春水泛滥，又曾向区政府要求加高培厚，但区长却说：“到春耕过后再行修补。”日前春雨连绵，区政府对此一问题，仍未引起高度注意，亦未及时检查，以致河水再度外溢成灾，淹没麦田约十三顷左右。经县政府去人领导堵口排水，已排出八百二十五亩。造成这一事件的原因，除县政府在领导上存有官僚主义，深入检查不够以外，主要是因为该区区政府存在着严重的麻痹大意，对群众不负责，对上级指示不重视的恶劣作风。县人民政府对这一问题除给予该区区长于振江以批评处分外，并通报全县，以资教戒。
