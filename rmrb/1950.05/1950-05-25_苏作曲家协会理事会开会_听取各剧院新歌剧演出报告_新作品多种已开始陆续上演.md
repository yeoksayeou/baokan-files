Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st (TASS): The fourth plenary meeting of the Council of the Soviet Composers Association is currently being held here. Attendees heard reports on the work of various theaters in performing new Soviet operas.

Golyainov, Director of the Opera House Administration, said that more than two years have passed since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued its decision on Muradeli's opera "The Great Friendship." During this period, Soviet composers have written eighteen operas and ten ballets. These works have all been included in the repertoire, and some have already been staged. Recently, the Leningrad Opera House premiered the opera "The Young Guard" by Ukrainian composer Meitus. This performance received high praise in theatrical circles and in newspapers. Not long ago, the Stalino Opera House in Donbas also staged this opera. The Tbilisi Opera House has made three productions—two operas and one ballet. Tashkent has staged Gliere and Sadykov's opera "Gyulsara," which tells the story of the Uzbek women's struggle against ancient superstitions and prejudices. Music critics pointed out that the rich Uzbek folk melodies are vividly reflected in this work.

Several new operas are now being prepared for performance in Soviet opera houses. In November, the Bolshoi Theater will premiere Zhukovsky's opera "From the Bottom of My Heart," with a script based on the novel of the same name by Maltsev, which has already gained wide acclaim among Soviet readers. This opera, which tells the story of the happy life of collective farm peasants, will also be staged by ten other opera houses, such as those in Leningrad, Novosibirsk, and Saratov.

The Bolshoi Theater company is rehearsing Shaporin's opera "The Decembrists" and will perform Krashev's opera "Morozko," which won the Stalin Prize, for young audiences.

The new Soviet operas: Kabalevsky's "The Taras Family," Troshin and Enke's "The Bride from Pskov," Kapp's "The Free Poet," Stepanov's "Ivan Bolotnikov," and Dankevich's "Bogdan Khmelnitsky," etc., have all been included in the repertoire of opera houses in Leningrad, Kiev, Lviv, Tallinn, and Molotov, among others.

　　苏作曲家协会理事会开会
    听取各剧院新歌剧演出报告
    新作品多种已开始陆续上演
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日电：苏联作曲家协会理事会第四次全体会议现正在此间举行，与会者听取了关于演出苏联新歌剧的各剧院的工作报告。
    歌剧院管理处处长高尔雅伊诺夫说，自从苏联共产党中央委员会发表关于穆拉德里斯的歌剧《伟大的友谊》的决定以来，已经过去了两年有余，苏联作曲家们在这一期间写了十八只歌剧和十只巴莱舞剧。这些作品都已列入剧目而且有些已经上演了。最近，列宁格勒歌剧院首次演出乌克兰作曲家梅伊图斯的歌剧《青年近卫军》。这次演出在戏剧界和报纸上获得了很高的评价。不久以前，顿巴斯的斯大林诺歌剧院也上演了这个歌剧。第比利斯歌剧院作了三次演出——两只歌剧和一只巴莱舞剧。塔什干曾上演格利埃雷和萨迪柯夫的歌剧《久尔萨拉》，这个歌剧系叙述乌兹贝克妇女对古老的迷信和偏见的斗争。音乐批评家们指出，乌兹贝克丰富的民间旋律在这个作品中得到了生动的反映。
    苏联各歌剧院现在准备上演若干新歌剧。十一月间，大剧院将首次上演儒科夫斯基的歌剧《全心全意》，脚本系根据在苏联读者中已经获得广大声誉的马尔节夫的一本同名的小说。这个叙述集体农场农民幸福生活的歌剧，同时将由另外十个歌剧院上演，如列宁格勒、新西伯利亚、萨拉托夫等处。
    大剧院的班底正在排演夏波林的歌剧《十二月党人》，并将为青年观众演出克拉舍夫获得斯大林奖金的歌剧《莫罗兹科》。
    苏联的新歌剧：卡布雷夫斯基的《塔拉斯家族》，特罗辛与恩凯的《阔新娘》，卡普的《自由诗人》，斯节潘诺夫的《伊凡·波洛特尼柯夫》，丹凯维奇的《鲍干·赫梅尔尼茨基》等，均已列入列宁格勒、基辅、罗夫、塔林和莫洛托夫等歌剧院的剧目之中。
