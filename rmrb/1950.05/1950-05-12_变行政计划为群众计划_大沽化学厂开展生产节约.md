　　Transforming Administrative Plans into Mass Plans
　　Dagu Chemical Plant Launches Production Savings Campaign
    [Our Newspaper] The Dagu Chemical Plant launched a production savings and cost reduction campaign in April. Based on the needs of the masses, workshop covenants, liaison contracts, workshop plans, and individual plans were universally established. This method transformed administratively formulated production plans into mass production plans, powerfully guaranteeing the completion of the plans. The evaporation room of the factory is the key workshop in the production movement. Before the movement began, the unity of the unit was first resolved, followed by research into the production plan. Each group put forward many guarantees, which were finally summarized into a mass workshop covenant. During the research on how to ensure the completion of the production tasks, the workers unanimously recognized the importance of close contact and cooperation between the relevant workshops. Therefore, a joint meeting of workshops was held to discuss and formulate a liaison contract including contact methods, raw material quality, and other content. Savings plans were also formulated for each group and individual, giving everyone a clear direction and specific goals. In the production movement, the evaporation room first created the brilliant achievement of completing the 277-day production task eight days ahead of schedule, saving 123 man-hours and 4,680 kilowatt-hours of electricity. Under the promotion and leadership of the evaporation room, the quality of products in other units (such as the electrolysis room, bleaching room, etc.) has improved compared to before, and accidents have also been relatively reduced. The factory will further strictly enforce standard operations, improve technical levels, improve various systems, implement material rewards, and launch rationalization proposals. The production savings movement will surely usher in a vigorous new situation.

　　变行政计划为群众计划
　　大沽化学厂开展生产节约
    【本报讯】大沽化学工厂于四月份开展生产节约降低成本运动。在群众需要的基础上，普遍订立了车间公约，联系合同，车间计划及个人计划。用这种方法，把行政上制订的生产计划变为群众的生产计划，有力地保证了计划的完成。该厂蒸发室为生产运动中的重点车间。在运动开始之前，首先解决了本单位的团结问题，接着研究生产计划。各组分别提出许多保证条件，最后归纳为群众性的车间公约。在研究如何保证完成生产任务时，工友们一致认识到各有关车间密切联系配合的重要。于是召开了车间联席会议，讨论订出包括联系方法，原料质量等内容的联系合同。并制订了各组及个人的节约计划，使大家有了明确的努力方向和具体目标。在生产运动中，蒸发室首先创造了提前八天完成二七十七天生产任务的光辉成绩，并节省人工一二三个，电力四六八○度。在蒸发室推动带领下，其他各单位（如电解室、漂白室等）制品质量均较前提高，事故亦相对减少。该厂将进一步严格标准操作，提高技术水平，健全各种制度，实行物质奖励，开展合理化建议，生产节约运动当会出现轰轰烈烈的新局面。
