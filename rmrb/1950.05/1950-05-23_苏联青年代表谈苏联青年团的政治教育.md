　　Soviet Youth Representative on Political Education in the Soviet Komsomol
    By our reporter Jin Feng
    This article is based on the speeches of Soviet youth representatives—Alexei Laposhin, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, and Sergei Dmitriev, Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee of the Komsomol, at symposiums and lectures.

    As the Soviet people are striving for the victory of communism, the most important task of the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League, fostered and cultivated by Lenin and Stalin, is to help the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to carry out communist education among the younger generation.

    The methods, content, and tools of education are diverse, including the study of Marxism-Leninism, amateur artistic activities, literature, film and sports, libraries, cultural palaces, clubs, rural reading rooms, sports fields, and so on. The Soviet government, the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and the Komsomol have created sufficient conditions for the communist education of Soviet youth, the most important of which is the large-scale youth political education directly controlled by the Soviet Komsomol, including self-study, political study groups, political schools, lectures, reports, and a series of strict educational networks.

    Planned and systematic self-study of Marxism-Leninism under the leadership and assistance of the Party is the most important method of study for Komsomol cadres and activists. Each Komsomol cadre has a one-year plan for self-study of Marxism-Leninism, which is discussed and approved by the Komsomol committee. The Party provides some consultants to supervise, inspect, and provide specific assistance. In addition, general cadres can also participate in correspondence universities or Party schools to study Marxism-Leninism.

    The vast number of Komsomol members and youth are organized in a led and planned way within the primary organizations of the Komsomol—these are political study groups and political schools. According to statistics in 1949, there were a total of 237,125 political study groups and political schools within the Komsomol organization, with more than 4 million Komsomol members and general youth participating in the study, and more than 1 million participating in the Party's study system. Political study groups and political schools are composed of 15 to 20 people, and study under the leadership of the propagandists assigned by the Komsomol. The content of the political study group is the Komsomol Charter and the structure of Soviet society and the state, and the study time is a total of 60 hours. The content of political school study is revolutionary history, socialist construction, the structure of the Soviet state and society, Party issues, and communist construction issues, and the study time is two years. There is a higher-level study group that studies the history of the All-Union Communist Party, which is often led by experienced Party propaganda cadres, is attached to the Party organization, and cooperates with the study of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. In addition, more than one million young people are organized, and 250,000 young people study the biographies of Lenin and Stalin by self-study methods.

    Organizing and leading such a large army of learners is the responsibility of the Komsomol at all levels. Several months before the start of each academic year (the academic year starts in November), the Komsomol committees at all levels must formulate, discuss, and publish teaching outlines and teaching plans for various political study organizations, convene study meetings and training courses for propagandists, prepare sufficient teaching materials, reference books, wall charts, and places for study. Finally, they must understand the study objects and classify them into political study organizations of various degrees according to the different political levels, cultural levels, and ages of the youth. After the start of the academic year, one of the regular key tasks of the Komsomol is to inspect and supervise various political study organizations and continuously select, train, and educate propagandists. This large army of propagandists, who actually lead political study organizations at all levels, is composed of Party, Soviet, and Komsomol workers who do not leave production, as well as various experts, scholars, and other intellectuals. They must be good at enriching the teaching syllabus with various lively and practical content, and be good at using reference materials, wall charts, maps, literary works, and organizing visits and tours to enable students to grasp the essence of the study materials.

    Another important way to carry out communist education among young people is to hold regular systematic lectures and reports on various topics, such as the life and career of Lenin and Stalin, Party building, Komsomol issues, the Soviet state system, the communist education of youth, the Soviet Union's foreign policy, the international situation, the world democratic youth movement, and various issues in literature, science, and art. These lectures and reports are led by the Komsomol organizations at all levels. The Komsomol Central Committee has a lecture section, the propaganda department of the Komsomol provincial committee has a lecture group, and the propaganda department of the municipal committee and district committee has a reporter group. Each group has about ten to twelve people, and is also composed of some local experts, scholars, and Party, Komsomol, and Soviet workers. After preparing the report according to the report outline, they will discuss and revise it at the group meeting to ensure that the report has rich and correct political content and beautiful language structure. Such reports are held about three to four times a month. In addition, there are small-scale discussion meetings held in workshops, schools, clubs, and dormitories, which are responsible for by Komsomol members.

    Due to the continuous concern of the All-Union Communist Party and Comrade Stalin for the communist education of youth, the Komsomol has put the communist education of youth in the first place in the work of the Komsomol. All activities of the Komsomol revolve around the communist education of youth. The ideological education of youth is no longer just the work of the propaganda and agitation department of the Komsomol, but is often the first issue to be considered and discussed on the agenda of the first secretary of the Komsomol at all levels and the entire Komsomol committee. This has made the scale of the political study of the Soviet Komsomol and youth expand day by day, and the quality improve day by day. Millions of Soviet youth are being educated and trained to be energetic, unafraid of difficulties, and striving to participate in the construction of communism.

### 苏联青年代表谈苏联青年团的政治教育

　　苏联青年代表谈苏联青年团的政治教育
    本报记者  金凤
    本文是根据苏联青年代表——苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会宣传部长阿力克赛·拉波兴及列宁格勒市团委会书记谢尔吉·德米特利也夫在座谈会及讲演会上的发言写成的。
    当苏联人民正在为共产主义的胜利而奋斗的时候，为列宁、斯大林所扶植、所培养着的苏联列宁共产主义青年团的最主要的任务就是帮助联共（布）在青年一代中间进行共产主义的教育。
    教育的方式、内容和工具是多种多样的，包括马列主义的研究和学习，业余艺术活动、文学电影和体育、图书馆、文化宫、俱乐部、农村阅览室、运动场等等。苏维埃政府、联共（布）和青年团为苏联青年的共产主义教育创设了足够的条件，其中最主要的是苏联青年团所直接掌握的规模巨大的青年政治教育，包括自学、政治学习小组、政治学校、讲演、报告等一系列严密的教育网。
    在党的领导和帮助下进行有计划、有系统的马列主义的自学，是青年团干部及活动分子最主要的学习方式。每个团干部有一年的自学马列主义的计划，在团委会上讨论批准。党配备了一部分的顾问，负责督促、检查和具体帮助。此外，一般干部还可以参加马列主义函授大学或党校学习。
    广大的青年团员及青年是在团的基层组织内有领导有计划地组织起来学习的——这就是政治学习小组和政治学校。一九四九年的统计，青年团的组织内共有二十三万七千一百二十五个政治学习小组和政治学校，参加学习的团员和一般青年有四百多万，另有一百多万参加党的学习系统。政治学习小组和政治学校都是由十五人到二十人组成，在团所委派的宣传员领导下进行学习，每星期集会一次。政治学习小组的学习内容是团章和苏联社会和国家的机构，学习时间一共是六十小时。政治学校的学习内容是革命史、社会主义建设、苏联国家和社会的结构、党的问题、共产主义建设问题等，学习的时间是两年。有一种更高的学习小组，是学习联共党史的，往往由党的有经验的宣传干部来领导，附设在党的组织内，并配合着学习马恩列斯的著作。此外，还有一百多万青年组织起来，二十五万青年用自修的方法，学习列宁、斯大林的传略。
    组织和领导这样的学习大军，是各级青年团的责任。在每个学年（学年是从十一月开始）开始之前几个月，青年团各级团委会要拟订、讨论和出版各个不同的政治学习组织的教学纲要和教学计划，召开宣传员的学习会和训练班，准备足够的教材、参考书、挂图和学习的地方，最后，了解学习的对象，根据青年们不同的政治水平、文化水平和年龄，将他们分别编入各种程度不同的政治学习组织。学年开始以后，团的经常的重心工作之一是检查和督促各种政治学习组织并不断的选拔培养和教育宣传员。这些实际领导各级政治学习组织的宣传员大军，是由不脱离生产的党的、苏维埃的和团的工作人员以及各种专家、学者及其他知识分子组成的。他们要善于用各种生动活泼的，切合实际的内容去丰富教学提纲，善于使用参考资料、挂图、地图、文学作品以及举办参观、游览等来使学员掌握学习材料的实质。
    在青年中进行共产主义教育的另一重要方式是举办定期的有系统的各种专题讲演和报告，如列宁、斯大林的生平事业、党的建设、团的问题、苏联国家制度、青年的共产主义教育、苏联的对外政策、国际形势、世界民主青年运动以及文学、科学、艺术上的种种问题。这些讲演和报告都是由青年团各级组织领导进行的。团中央有讲演科，团的州委会的宣传部设有讲演员小组，市委会、区委会的宣传部设有报告员小组。每一组大约有十人到十二人，也是由当地一部分专家，学者及党、团、苏维埃的工作人员组成。他们根据了报告提纲准备了报告以后，要在小组会上讨论和修正，使报告都有丰富正确的政治内容和优美的语文结构。这样的报告一个月大约举行三回到四回。除此而外，还有车间、学校、俱乐部和宿舍中举行的小型谈话会，由青年团员们负责主持。
    由于联共党和斯大林同志对于青年的共产主义教育的不断关怀，青年团已把青年的共产主义教育工作提到了团的工作的第一位。团的一切活动，都围绕着青年的共产主义教育进行。青年的思想教育工作，已不仅仅是团的宣传鼓动部的工作，而常常是各级团组织的第一书记以及全部团委会的议事日程上首先要考虑和讨论的问题，这就使得苏联青年团和青年的政治学习的规模一天天的扩大，质量一天天的提高。千百万的苏联青年正被教育锻炼为生气蓬勃、不怕困难、奋力参加共产主义的建设战士。
