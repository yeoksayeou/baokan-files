　　Jilin No. 41 Factory Reverses Production Chaos
    Liu Zhengde Group Takes the Lead in Improving Quality
    Jilin Municipal Party Committee Instructs Universal Promotion of the Group's Experience
    [This newspaper, Jilin News] The Liu Zhengde Advanced Production Group in the Casting Department of Jilin No. 41 Factory took the lead in improving quality and reversing the chaotic situation in the department's production, and was commended and materially rewarded by the factory's management committee. The Jilin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the group's experience in leading production and promoted it universally to various factories. On March 22, the casting department began manufacturing waterwheels. Administratively, quotas were set, and an excess piece-rate bonus system was implemented. At that time, due to insufficient education of workers by the administration and the trade union, a serious waste phenomenon of workers universally pursuing quantity but not paying attention to quality arose, resulting in increased defective products. The defective rate of individual groups reached as high as 85%. Some workers also complained that the administration's "inspection was too strict" and that "the administration was unwilling to give excess bonuses," and their thinking was extremely chaotic. At that time, the defective rate of the Liu Zhengde group was also very high, averaging 33.1%, and reaching as high as 60% on the worst day.

    In order to change this situation, Party and government leading cadres put forward the call to "increase production on the basis of quality first and reducing defective products." Liu Zhengde then united the entire group and worked hard to research and quickly improve quality. Before April 5, the defective rate had been reduced to an average of 7.1%, and the quantity also exceeded the quota by one-third. This advanced example improved the confidence of all the workers. Driven by the Liu Zhengde group, other groups also quickly solved the quality problem. In April, the Liu Zhengde group completed the task of producing 300 waterwheels for the entire month five days ahead of schedule, and the defective rate was reduced by 2% compared to the administrative regulations.

    How did the Liu Zhengde group achieve these results?

    The main reasons why the Liu Zhengde group was able to achieve the above results are:

    First, on April 1, the casting department branch held a meeting to discuss how to improve quality. After the meeting, Liu Zhengde immediately convened the entire group for discussion. He first reviewed the reasons for the high number of defective products in the past, mainly his own neglect of quality. Subsequently, he tried his best to encourage everyone to express their opinions. During the discussion, it was discovered that the technical allocation in the past was inappropriate, the division of labor was unclear, and there was no one responsible for bad work. Under the principle of taking into account technical conditions and considering physical conditions (some work was indeed more strenuous), it was decided to adopt a voluntary joint allocation method and implement a reasonable division of labor. On this basis, a responsibility system was established, so that someone was responsible for each product.

    Second, the Liu Zhengde group often used after-work or spare time to hold meetings to discuss production and mobilize everyone to use their brains and think of more ways. Therefore, when defective products appeared, it was easy to find the cause and solve it. At the same time, before starting work, the group prepared and distributed tools and materials such as sandboxes and sand, and immediately started work when the time came, without delaying any time; after work, they cleaned up all the tools and things used by the group and locked them in the toolbox by a dedicated person, so that the production process was more orderly.

    Third, the group leader set an example, united the entire group, patiently educated, and transformed backward workers. In this group, the party member Zheng Caiheng was relatively backward, liked to say strange things, and did not like to work. No group wanted him. The branch was preparing to expel him from the party. Group members Hao Yujian, Zuo Yufu, Liu Qingtang, etc. were also not very active. When these people were in other groups, they were well-known "sick leave squads" (meaning they did not like to work and liked to take breaks), so everyone had opinions about them and thought it was no good for the group to have them. However, Liu Zhengde patiently approached them, understood their feelings, and conducted individual education to win them over. In March, the group received an excess bonus of 630,000 yuan. In order to encourage backward workers and apprentices, Liu Zhengde proposed, and everyone agreed, to distribute the money to them, which moved them even more. In work, Liu Zhengde was able to endure hardship first. Pouring molten iron was the most tiring, so he poured molten iron. This exemplary role further stimulated the active transformation of backward workers, strengthened the unity of the whole group, and as a result, they all automatically helped each other, and the atmosphere was completely new.

    Fourth, Liu Zhengde often paid attention to grasping and encouraging the mood of the workers, and was able to put forward timely demands based on specific circumstances. When there were many defective products in the casting department and the workers' confidence was not high, he immediately encouraged the whole group not to be discouraged, implemented a reasonable division of labor, and established a responsibility system, which improved the workers' morale. He immediately seized this opportunity, put forward the slogan of reducing defective products and increasing quantity, and demanded that 12 units be produced every day (originally set at nine). Everyone said, "Okay! There's a way!" After being commended by the factory management committee for the first time, he immediately convened a meeting and called on everyone to make another effort. Based on everyone's mood and the Party's instructions to ensure quality, he put forward the requirement of improving quantity on the basis of ensuring quality, so that the group's production continued to improve.

    How should it be consolidated and improved in the future?

    The above advantages of the Liu Zhengde group are only a beginning, and many aspects are still spontaneous. The first issue in the future is to turn the existing good things into regularly implemented systems and insist on implementation. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen technical learning and learn from the experience of the Ma Hengchang model group, organize technical research groups, and hold regular technical research meetings to continue to improve production efficiency. At the same time, advanced elements in production should be absorbed into the Party and the League to strengthen the core and backbone of leadership production. The factory's Party organization should strengthen their training and assistance, conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and education inside and outside the Party, protect the Liu Zhengde group's labor enthusiasm from being dampened, so that both inside and outside the Party truly recognize the advantages of the advanced group, and make it continue to improve in all aspects and become a banner for the entire factory, learning from the Ma Hengchang group.

　　吉林四一工厂扭转生产混乱现象
    刘正德组带头提高质量
    吉林市委指示普遍推广该组经验
    【本报吉林讯】吉林市四一工厂铸造部刘正德先进生产小组，带头提高质量，扭转了该部生产中的混乱局面，受到该厂管委会的表扬和物质奖励。吉林市中共市委总结了该组领导生产的经验，普遍向各厂推广。三月二十二日，铸造部开始制造水车。行政上规定了定额，实行超额计件奖励办法。当时，由于行政、工会对工人教育的不够，工人中曾经产生了普遍追逐数量，但不注意质量，因而废品增多的严重浪费现象。个别组的废品率竟达百分之八十五。部分工人还埋怨行政上“检查太严”，“行政不愿给超额奖”等，思想极为混乱。当时，刘正德组的废品率亦很高，平均为百分之三三点一，最坏的一天竟达百分之六十。
    为了改变这种情况，党、政领导干部提出“在质量第一，减少废品的基础上提高生产”的号召。刘正德便团结全组，努力研究，很快提高了质量。在四月五日前，废品率已降低到平均百分之七点一，数量上也超过定额三分之一。这一先进范例，提高了全部工友的信心。在刘正德小组推动下，其他各组也很快地解决了质量问题。四月份，刘正德组提前五天完成全月生产三百台水车的任务，废品率较行政上的规定降低百分之二。
    刘正德小组的成绩是怎样做出来的呢？
    刘正德小组所以能做出上述成绩，主要是由于：
    第一、四月一日，铸造部支部开会，讨论了如何提高质量的问题。会后，刘正德立即召集全组进行讨论。他先检讨了过去废品多的原因，主要是自己忽视质量。随后，就尽力启发大家发表意见。在讨论当中，发现过去技术配备不合适，分工不明确，活作坏了无人负责的缺点。大家在照顾技术条件，兼顾身体条件（有些活确较吃力）的原则下，决定采取自愿联合的配备办法，实行了合理的分工。在这个基础上，建立了专责制度，使每件产品都有人负责。
    第二、刘正德小组经常利用下班或空余时间，开会讨论生产，发动大家多用脑筋，多想办法。因此，出现了废品，也容易找出原因、加以解决。同时该组在上班前，就把沙箱、沙子等工具材料准备好、分配好，到了时间，马上动手工作，一点也不耽误时间；下班后又都把工具及小组所用的东西收拾好，由专人保管，锁在工具箱里，使生产的进行较有秩序。
    第三、组长以身示范，团结全组，耐心教育，改造了落后的工友。在这一小组内，党员郑才恒较落后，好讲怪话，不爱干活。那个组都不爱要他。支部曾准备开除他的党籍。组员郝玉俭、左玉富、刘庆堂等也不大积极。这些人在别的组时，都是有名的病号班（意即不爱干活，好歇工）故大家对他们都有意见，认为组里有他们没好处。但刘正德耐心地接近他们，了解他们的心情，进行个别教育争取。三月份，该组得到了六十三万元的超额奖。为了鼓励落后的工友及学习工，刘正德提出，并经大家同意，把钱分给他们，更使他们受了感动。在工作上，刘正德能吃苦在前。倒铁水最累，他就倒铁水。这种模范作用更刺激落后的工友积极转变，全组的团结加强了，结果都自动互相帮助，气象焕然一新。
    第四、刘正德经常注意掌握与鼓舞工人情绪，并能根据具体情况提出适时的要求。当铸造部废品多，工人信心不高时，他即鼓动全组不要灰心，实行合理分工，建立专责制，提高了工人情绪。他立即抓住这个时机，提出减少废品提高数量的口号，要求每天作到十二台（原定九台）。大家都说：“行！有门！”第一次受到工厂管委会表扬后，他就马上召集会议，号召大家再用一把劲。根据大家的情绪，并根据党的保证质量的指示，他又提出在保证质量的基础上，提高数量的要求，使该组生产不断提高。
    今后应如何巩固与提高？
    刘正德小组的上述优点，只是一个开端，有许多地方还带有自发性。今后第一个问题，就是把已有的好的东西变为经常执行的制度，坚持贯彻。其次必须加强技术学习，并学习马恒昌模范小组的经验，组织技术研究小组，召开定期研究技术的会议，以继续提高生产效率。同时应吸收生产中的先进分子入党、入团，加强领导生产的核心与骨干力量。该厂党组织应加强对他们的培养与帮助，在党内外广泛深入地进行宣传教育，保护刘正德小组的劳动热情不受打击，使党内外真正认识到先进小组的优点，并从各方面使之继续提高，成为全厂的一面旗帜，向马恒昌小组看齐。
