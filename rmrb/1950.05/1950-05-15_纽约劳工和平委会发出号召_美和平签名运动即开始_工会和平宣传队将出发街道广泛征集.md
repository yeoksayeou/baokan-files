Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch from New York: TASS, New York: According to an announcement by the New York Labor Peace Conference: An enthusiastic campaign to solicit signatures on peace petitions will be held during the week beginning May 22nd. Representatives of the conference said: In order to solicit signatures, the various peace committees established by the New York garment workers have organized visits to various garment factories and have also held several peace gatherings. The Fur Workers Union of the CIO has also set up special counters on the streets near major garment stores in New York to solicit signatures on peace petitions. The New York Labor Peace Conference also called for the organization of "Peace Propaganda Teams" during Peace Week to urge citizens to sign peace petitions.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch from Helsinki: TASS, Helsinki, 13th: A joint delegation from the "Finnish Peace Supporters" organization and the "Finnish Standing Committee for the Defense of Peace" has submitted a peace petition with the signatures of 270,000 Finnish residents to the Speaker of the Finnish National Assembly. The list of signatures is bound into eleven thick volumes.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch from New York: TASS, New York: A thousand teachers and parents demonstrated in front of the New York City Board of Education on the 9th, demanding the reinstatement of eight high school teachers, all of whom are employees and activists of the Teachers Union, who were recently dismissed for refusing to answer inquiries about their views and party affiliations. The Teachers Union issued a statement to the press saying that the Board of Education is trying to undermine the Teachers Union, partly to prevent teachers from fighting for increased salaries, and partly because the Teachers Union exposed the undemocratic views and actions of the New York school superintendent, Jansen. The Arts, Sciences and Professions Council also issued a statement to the press saying that the dismissal of the eight teachers has "greatly shocked all Americans who cherish freedom of thought and association."

    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：一千名教师与家长于九日在纽约的教育局门前示威，要求恢复八名中学教员的职位，这些教员全是教师联合会的职员和活动家，最近因为拒绝答复有关他们的见解与党派关系的询问而被解聘。教师联合会向报界散发声明宣说：教育局力图破坏教师联合会，其原因部分是为了阻止教师们要求增加薪金的斗争，部分是因为教师联合会揭露了纽约学校的学监詹生的不民主的见解与行动。艺术科学与自由职业委员会也向报界发表声明说：解聘八位教师之举，使“一切珍视思想与结社自由的美国人大为震惊”。
