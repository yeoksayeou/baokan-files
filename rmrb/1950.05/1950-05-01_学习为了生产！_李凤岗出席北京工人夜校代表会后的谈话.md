　　Learning for Production!
　　Li Fenggang's Talk After Attending the Beijing Workers' Night School Representatives Meeting
　　Li Fenggang is a worker in the supply section of Harbin Cement Plant. Last July, the factory established a workers' night school. With the help of the night school teachers, he has a high enthusiasm for learning and has made great progress, and can motivate everyone to learn. At the end of the semester, their class was selected as a model class, and he was selected as an outstanding model student. Because of his progress in learning and improved awareness, he also did a good job. At the end of last year, he was selected as a model worker and gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. This time, he was selected to attend the Workers' Night School Representatives Meeting. The following is his talk after returning from the meeting.
　　The meeting was held in Beijing on April 1st. Representatives from nine cities attended. The Northeast was represented by the two cities of Harbin and Dalian. At the meeting, the responsible comrades of the cultural and educational departments of the local trade unions gave reports. The meeting emphasized that the study of workers' night schools should be combined with production to encourage the production enthusiasm of employees. Learning is also for production.
　　On the second day, Xie Shishan, a model student from Dalian, gave a report introducing his learning situation. He is a worker at the Dalian Fisheries Company and initially did not recognize a single character. After liberation, the Soviet Red Army came to Dalian and organized worker literacy classes. At first, he was also unwilling to study. Later, he got the hang of it and learned more than 1,000 characters in one year and more than 2,000 characters in less than two years. Because his cultural knowledge has improved, he has also learned a bit about studying technology. Soon, he created a new record for the transformation of ice machines, and was later promoted to branch factory director.
　　On the third day, Sun Baotian, a student representative from Jinan, reported on his learning experience, which he described as very interesting. He used to be an electrical worker and also did not recognize a single character. When he first went to school, he bought a fountain pen, but he could not write well. Even with a fountain pen, he did not know how to use it. Plus, he had a heavy hand, and when he wrote with a fountain pen, he would press two crosses. Some workers laughed at him and said, "Ha, others use fountain pens to write, you use crosses to write..." But Sun Baotian was not discouraged and worked even harder, practicing day and night. As a result, he wrote very well in more than a year. He himself said, "As long as you are willing to work hard, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome." Because his cultural level has improved and he knows more principles, he has now been elected as the chairman of the trade union.
　　On the fourth day, Qian, the Deputy Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, gave a report, and Soviet experts reported on the life and study of workers in the Soviet Union. He said: The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics organized a "Down with Illiteracy Committee" in order to eliminate illiteracy. There is almost no illiteracy in socialist countries.
　　The example of the Soviet elder brother makes us more determined to eliminate illiteracy. If every worker comrade becomes a worker-peasant intellectual, how great a contribution would that be to our economic construction!
　　This meeting has made me realize that if we want to do a good job in our new democratic economic construction, our working class must improve our cultural knowledge. We study culture not simply to improve ourselves, but for our production and construction. Therefore, I hope that every worker comrade will work hard to improve their cultural knowledge.

### 学习为了生产！  李凤岗出席北京工人夜校代表会后的谈话

　　学习为了生产！
    李凤岗出席北京工人夜校代表会后的谈话
    李凤岗是哈尔滨水泥厂供应科工友。去年七月，厂里成立了工人夜校，他在夜校教员帮助下，学习情绪很高，进步很大，并能带动大家学习。学期末，他们那班被选为模范班，他被选为特等模范学员。由于他学习进步，觉悟提高，工作也做得好了。去年年末，他被选为模范工作者，并且光荣地参加了中国共产党。这次又被选出席工人夜校代表会。下面是他开完会回去后的谈话。
    四月一日在北京开会，到会的有九个城市的代表，东北有哈尔滨和大连两个都市参加，在会上由各地工会文教部负责同志作报告，在会上强调了工人夜校的学习应该结合生产，鼓舞职工的生产情绪。学习也是为了生产。
    第二天，由大连的模范学员——谢世山同志作报告，介绍他的学习情况。他是大连渔业公司的工人，起初一个字也不识。解放以后，苏联红军来到了大连，组织了工人识字班，他起初也是不愿学习，以后入了门，一年就认识了一千多字，不到二年就认识了两千多字。由于他的文化知识提高了，对钻研技术上也摸点门了，不久他就创造了改造冰机的新纪录，以后被提拔为支厂长了。
    第三天，济南学员代表孙宝田同志报告他的学习经过，他说的非常有趣。他从前是电气工人，也是一个字不识，在乍一上学的时候，买了一支钢笔，但字写不好，有钢笔也不会使，又加上手重，用钢笔一写字，就按成了两个叉字，有的工友笑他说：“哈，别人用钢笔写字，你用叉子写字……。”但孙宝田并不泄气，更加劲了，黑天白日的练，结果一年多的工夫写的非常好了，他自己说：“只要肯努力，没有克服不了的困难。”由于他的文化程度提高了，道理知道的也多了，现在被选上了工会主任。
    第四天，中央人民政府教育部钱副部长作报告，并由苏联专家报告苏联的工人生活及学习，他说：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟为了消灭文盲，组织了一个“打倒文盲委员会”。在社会主义国家里差不多没有文盲了。
    苏联老大哥这个例子使我们更有决心消灭文盲。如果我们每个工友同志都变成了工农知识分子，那对我们的经济建设的贡献该多大呀！
    这次的开会，使我知道了，要想把我们新民主主义的经济建设搞好，我们工人阶级就得提高我们的文化知识。我们学习文化不单纯是为了提高自己，而是为了我们的生产建设，所以我希望每个工友同志都要努力提高自己的文化知识。
