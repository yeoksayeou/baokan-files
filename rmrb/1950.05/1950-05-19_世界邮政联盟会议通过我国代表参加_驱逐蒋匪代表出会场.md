Xinhua News Agency, Bern, May 18th: TASS, Bern, May 18th—The Executive and Liaison Committee meeting of the Universal Postal Union opened on the 15th. At the meeting of the committee, the Soviet representative made a statement proposing that the Kuomintang representative be expelled from the committee because he does not represent China. The Soviet representative also suggested recognizing the representative of the People's Republic of China as the legitimate representative of China. The Czech representative supported the Soviet representative's motion.
However, the Soviet and Czech representatives' proposal was rejected by the committee. The Swiss representative then proposed that the representative of the People's Republic of China should be allowed to attend this meeting of the committee as the only recognized representative of China.
As a result of the above proposal, the committee passed a resolution by secret ballot that "the representative of the People's Republic of China should be allowed to attend this meeting of the Executive Committee as the only recognized representative of China."
The Kuomintang representative had to comply with the chairman's proposal and leave the meeting.

　　世界邮政联盟会议通过我国代表参加
　　驱逐蒋匪代表出会场
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社伯尔尼十八日讯：世界邮政联盟执行与联络委员会会议于十五日开幕。在委员会的会议上，苏联代表发表声明，建议将国民党代表逐出委员会，因为他不代表中国。苏联代表并建议承认中华人民共和国的代表为合法的中国代表。捷克代表支持苏联代表的动议。
    可是，苏联及捷克代表的建议被委员会加以拒绝。瑞士代表于是提议应允许中华人民共和国的代表以唯一被认可的中国代表的资格出席委员会的这次会议。
    由于上述提议的结果，委员会以秘密投票通过决议“应允许中华人民共和国的代表作为唯一被认可的中国代表出席执行委员会的这次会议。”
    国民党代表乃不得不遵从主席的提议，离开会场。
