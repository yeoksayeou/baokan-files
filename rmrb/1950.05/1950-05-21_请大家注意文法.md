Short Commentary

　　Mr. Lü Shuxiang published "Reading Notes" in the fifth issue of "Study" (reprinted in today's newspaper), offering positive criticisms from the aspects of grammar and rhetoric regarding certain documents and commentaries published in this newspaper. This is very beneficial work. We express our welcome and gratitude to Mr. Lü's work.

　　We should strive to establish a correct writing style. One element of this correct writing style is correct grammar. The words published in newspapers affect the general public at all times and in all places, not only in content but also in the methods of using language. Therefore, those who do editing and interviewing work, and those who write for newspapers, should take responsibility for ensuring that what they write has correct grammar.

　　Paying attention to grammar is by no means so-called "pedantry." To help draw everyone's attention, we would like to introduce Stalin's views on grammar, as described by Yakovlev, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Aviation Industry:

　　"Stalin could not tolerate illogical writing. When he received documents with incoherent sentences, he would get angry.

　　—Truly illiterate people! But if you criticize him, he will immediately say that he is from a worker-peasant background, using this as an excuse for his illiteracy. This explanation is incorrect. It is due to a lack of love for culture and carelessness. Especially in national defense, it is even more unacceptable to use a worker-peasant background to explain one's lack of education, technical preparation, rudeness, or lack of understanding. Because the enemy will never yield to us because of our social origin. Precisely because we are workers and peasants, we should be fully prepared on all issues, no less than the enemy. "

　　Yakovlev then described the situation when he was ordered by Stalin to record dictated documents:

　　"I knew he paid close attention to this matter, so I strained all my mental faculties, striving to ensure that there were no grammatical errors. As he dictated, he would occasionally come to me and look over my shoulder to see how I was writing. He suddenly stopped, looked at what I had written, then grabbed my hand holding the pencil and pointed out a comma.

　　On another occasion, there was a sentence that I had not constructed perfectly. Stalin said:

　　—Why did you put the subject after the object? You've placed the subject a bit awkwardly! It should be like this!—and immediately corrected it.

　　After this incident, I very carefully reviewed Russian grammar once more.

　　Comrade Stalin believed that expressing one's thoughts correctly and fluently is of great significance.

　　If a person cannot express his meaning fluently and correctly, then his thinking is equally chaotic. How can he do the things he is entrusted with well?"

　　If our language has incorrect or awkward places, then it shows that our thoughts are unclear and confused in those places. Isn't it a mistake to convey unclear and confused thoughts to the general public using unclear and confused language?

　　Therefore, we not only require our own editors and reporters, but also all contributors and readers of the newspaper, and responsible comrades of all organizations and groups, to pay attention to grammar. We should strive to express correct and accurate thoughts with correct and accurate language; we should gradually, and finally completely, eliminate all grammatical errors from all the texts we publish.

### 请大家注意文法

　　请大家注意文法
    吕叔湘先生在《学习》第二卷第五期上发表了《读报札记》（今日本报转载），对本报所刊登的某些文件和评论文字，从文法和修辞方面，提出了积极的批评。这是很有益的工作。我们对于吕先生的工作表示欢迎和感谢。
    我们应该努力树立正确的文风。这种正确的文风的一个要素就是正确的文法。在报纸上刊登的文字，不但在内容上，而且在使用语言文字的方法上，随时随地都会使人民大众受到影响。因此，做编辑采访工作的人，给报纸写稿的人，就都要负起一个责任，使自己写出来的东西具有正确的文法。
    讲究文法决不是所谓“咬文嚼字”。为了帮助引起大家的注意，我们愿将苏联航空工业部副部长雅可夫列夫所叙述的斯大林对于文法的见解介绍一下：
    “斯大林不能容忍文理不通的现象。当他接到字句不通的文件时，他就气愤起来。
    ——真是文理不通的人！但是要责备他一下，他马上就会说他是工农出身，借以解释自己文盲的原因。这种解释是不正确的。这是不爱文化和粗心大意的原故。特别在国防事业中，更不允许拿工农出身来解释自己教育程度的不足，来解释自己没有技术准备，粗鲁或不通事理。因为敌人绝不会因为我们的社会出身而向我们让步。正因为我们是工农，我们更应当在一切问题上都有周详充分的准备，毫不亚于敌人才对。”
    雅可夫列夫接着描写他受斯大林的命令记录口授文件时的情形说：
    “我知道他很注意这件事情，所以我紧张起全部脑力，竭力使文法没有丝毫错误。他一面口授，一面不时地来到我跟前，从我肩上看看写得怎样。他忽然站住，看看我写的以后，就握住我执铅笔的手，点了一个逗点。
    还有一次，有一句我没有完全造好。斯大林说道：
    ——为什么您把这主词写在宾词后面呢？您把主词安置得有点不顺当吧！应当这样才对！——就马上给改正了。
    过了这回事情以后，我又极用心地温习了一次俄文文法。
    斯大林同志认为正确地、通顺地表达出自己的思想是有很大意义的。
    如果一个人不能把自己的意思通顺地、正确地表达出来，那他的思索也就同样是杂乱无章的。那他怎能办好被委托的事情呢？”
    我们的语言文字，如果有不正确、不通顺的地方，那就表示了我们的思想在那些地方是不清楚的，是有混乱的。我们把不清楚的、混乱的思想，用不清楚的、混乱的语言文字，传达到人民大众中去，岂不是一种过失吗？
    因此，我们不但要求报社自己的编辑、记者同志们，而且也要求报纸的一切投稿者和读者同志们，要求一切机关、团体的负责同志们，都来注意文法。应当努力用正确无误的语言文字来表达正确无误的思想；应当把文法上的一切错误，从我们所有发表的文字中逐步地，最后是彻底地，消灭掉。
