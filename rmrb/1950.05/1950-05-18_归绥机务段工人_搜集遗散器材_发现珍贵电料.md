　　GuiSui Locomotive Depot Workers
　　Collect Scattered Equipment
　　Discover Valuable Electrical Materials
    [Our Newspaper GuiSui News] The Electrical Section of the GuiSui Locomotive Depot of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway has discovered dozens of types of valuable electrical materials hidden by the Japanese invaders, worth over 20,000 catties of millet. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, workers had heard rumors that "in the ceiling of the electrical work area and other rooms, there were electrical equipment hidden by the Japanese invaders when they collapsed." On April 18th, after Director Li Jun of the GuiSui Office made an appeal at the mobilization meeting for inventorying materials, all the workers in the Electrical Section carefully searched everywhere. In the very thick dust on the roof of the electrical work area, they found many valuable electrical materials, such as various electricity meters and other materials not easily available in the country, totaling 27 types. They also found a large amount of equipment from the roof of the signal work area of the Telecommunications Section. Calculated according to the basic material unit price of the railway, the total value is 13,691,060 yuan, equivalent to 22,818 catties of millet, calculated at 600 yuan per catty of millet.
