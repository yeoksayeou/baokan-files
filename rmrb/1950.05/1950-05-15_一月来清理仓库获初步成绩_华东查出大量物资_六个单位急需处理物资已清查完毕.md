Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 13th: The warehouse material cleanup in East China has achieved preliminary results in the past month. To date, 125 warehouses have been cleaned up, accounting for 29.1% of the 429 warehouses registered by various departments with the East China Warehouse Material Cleanup Branch. Among them, the Finance Department, Industry Department, Navigation Administration Bureau of the Transportation Department, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Shanghai Railway Bureau, and Health Bureau of the East China Military and Political Committee had completed the inventory of urgently needed materials by May 5th. Of the materials that have been cleaned up and allocated, in addition to military equipment, materials allocated to the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Fuel, and the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government of the Central People's Government, and the Transportation Department and Industry Department of the Central and South China Military and Political Committee, according to the instructions of the Central People's Government, are valued at over 140 billion RMB. Other daily necessities and consumer goods available for sale by the East China Trade Department, Industry Department, and Finance Department are estimated to be worth 400 billion RMB.

The East China Branch of the National Warehouse Material Cleanup and Allocation Committee was established on April 5th. With the assistance of the East China Working Group of the General Committee, it organized a general office, focusing on Shanghai, to carry out the work. It stipulated that in April, the focus would be on cleaning up and reporting urgently needed materials. Two working groups were first dispatched to specifically assist the Industry Department and Finance Department of the East China Military and Political Committee in cleaning up their subordinate warehouses.

In the past, when receiving enemy and puppet materials in East China and Shanghai, most of them were only counted according to the original documents without opening the boxes for inspection. Later, it was discovered that the materials listed in the documents often did not match the actual situation; some documents only had the names of the materials without specifications. Therefore, this time the method of opening the boxes for inspection was adopted, revealing a huge quantity of materials. One warehouse opened all the boxes and found that they were all new machines lacking domestically, as well as various machine tools, including extremely valuable automatic control lathes. Another box contained dozens of diamond drill bits for drilling machines, as well as hundreds of diamond grinding wheels and various grinding wheels. In the vehicle equipment warehouse and the industrial and mining equipment warehouse, thousands of tons of pipe joints were found, which is estimated to be several times more than the number ordered by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government from the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government this year.

The enthusiastic and conscientious spirit of the workers in cherishing national assets has played a huge role in the progress of the cleanup work. The four thousand tons of materials in the industrial and mining equipment warehouse, totaling more than 20,000 kinds, were all counted and recorded one by one during the cleanup. Even screws as small as one or two fen in length were counted and weighed. More than 10,000 light bulbs stored were all taken out for inspection. The workers also found many unrecorded materials, such as the No. 10 factory of the China Textile Construction Company discovering white cotton flannel used for leather rollers that had been accumulated for twenty years, enough for 20,000 spindles, which is currently difficult to buy on the market. The efforts of the workers have turned a large number of waste materials in many departments into useful assets. For example, the Shanghai Postal Administration cleared out 150 bags of cloth tags from the basement that had been treated as waste materials during the Kuomintang period, with a value of over 100 million RMB. A warehouse cleared out a complete generator from waste materials. The open-air warehouse of the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory was piled with five tons of pig iron, which the workers believe can be cast into four 200-horsepower motor housings after research.

During the cleanup, it was also discovered that some units did not cherish national property, resulting in serious losses. For example, the People's Pharmaceutical Company had 14,000 bottles of penicillin, each containing 3 million units, which were found to be three months past their expiration date. Individual units even showed a tendency towards departmentalism. For example, the Pesticide Factory had mosquito nets and gasoline drums that were not needed by the enterprise, but the person in charge of the factory refused to report them according to the regulations for urgently needed materials.

The cleanup work has encountered some difficulties, such as opening boxes for inspection, which requires a lot of manpower, materials, and time, and if protection is not provided after opening the original packaging, losses will be incurred. Now, workers and technical staff are studying ways to solve various difficulties.

In order to further improve the cleanup work, the General Office of the East China Branch of the National Warehouse Material Cleanup and Allocation Committee has formed six groups of experts in industrial and mining equipment, transportation, telecommunications equipment, medical and health, military industrial equipment, and general materials. Since the 29th of last month, they have been dispatched to various warehouses to assist the warehouses in continuing the cleanup work according to the five cleanup requirements of material type, specifications, status, quantity, and valuation. It is expected that the entire cleanup work will be completed by the end of May, and the work of sorting and summarizing can be completed before the end of June.

### 一月来清理仓库获初步成绩　华东查出大量物资　六个单位急需处理物资已清查完毕

　　一月来清理仓库获初步成绩
　　华东查出大量物资     
    六个单位急需处理物资已清查完毕
    【新华社上海十三日电】华东区仓库物资清理工作一个月来已获初步成绩。迄今已经清理完毕的仓库计有一百二十五个，占各部门向华东仓库物资清理分会登记待清理的四百二十九个仓库的百分之二十九点一。其中华东军政委员会财政部、工业部、交通部航务管理局、招商局、上海铁路局、卫生局等六个单位，截至五月五日为止，已将急需处理的物资清查完毕。在已经清理调配的物资中，除军用器材外，已按中央人民政府指示调拨给中央人民政府铁道部、燃料部、东北人民政府工业部、中南军政委员会交通部、工业部的物资，折价达人民币一千四百余亿元。其他如华东贸易部、工业部、财政部可供出售的生活日用、消费品等，估计值人民币四千亿元。
    全国仓库物资清理调配委员会华东分会系于四月五日成立，在总会华东工作团的协助下，组织了办公厅，以上海为重点，开展工作，并规定四月份以清理造报急需处理的物资为中心，首先派出两个工作组具体帮助华东军政委员会工业部和财政部对所属仓库进行清理工作。
    华东地区及上海，在过去接收敌伪物资时，大都只根据原单据进行清点，没有开箱检查。后来发现单据所列物资往往与实际情形不符；有的单据上又只有物资名称，没有规格。因此这次采取了开箱检查的办法，查出了数量庞大的物资。某仓库打开全部装箱，发现其中全部是国内所缺少的新机器以及包括极为贵重的自动控制车床在内的各种工作母机。另一箱内有钻机用的金刚钻钻头十数只、金刚砂轮及各式砂轮数百只。在车辆器材库和工矿器材库中，查出管子接头千数吨，据估价较中央人民政府铁道部本年度向中央人民政府重工业部订购的数目多出数倍。
    职工们爱护国家资财的积极认真的精神，对于清查工作的进行发生了巨大作用。工矿器材库存四千吨物资计两万余种，在清理时都逐一经过清点和记账，连一、二分长的螺丝钉也均点数过磅。存贮的一万多只电灯泡，每只都取出检验。职工们并查出不少漏账的物资，如中国纺织建设公司第十厂查出积存了二十年的皮棍上所用的白棉呢布，足供两万纱锭之用，是目前市场上所难以买到的。职工们的努力使得许多部门的大批废料翻身，变成有用的资财。如上海邮政管理局从地下室里清出国民党时期已作为废料的一百五十多袋布牌，价值在一亿元以上。某仓库从废料中清出完整的发电机一部。上海电机厂露天仓库上堆着五吨生铁，经职工们研究，认为可以翻砂制成二百匹马力的马达壳子四个。
    在清查中，也发现某些单位不爱惜国家财产而酿成严重损失的情形。如人民制药公司存有一万四千瓶盘尼西林，每瓶含量三百万单位，查出时已逾有效期限三个月。个别单位更有本位主义倾向。如病虫药剂厂存有蚊帐布及汔油筒等并非该企业所需要的物资，但该厂负责人竟拒绝按急需处理物资的规定向上呈报。
    清理工作曾遇到过一些困难，例如开箱检查，需要很多的人力、物力和时间，且在打开原来包装以后如果不加保护，便要受到损失。现在职工和技术工作人员们正在研究解决各种困难的办法。
    全国仓库物资清理调配委员会华东分会办公厅为了进一步做好清查工作，特由专家组成工矿器材、交通运输、电讯器材、医药卫生、军工器材、一般物资等六个小组，自上月二十九日起，分赴各个仓库，按照物资的种类、规格、现状、数量与估价等五项清理要求，帮助各仓库继续进行清查工作。预计全部清理工作至五月底可告一段落，六月底以前可完成整理归总的工作。
