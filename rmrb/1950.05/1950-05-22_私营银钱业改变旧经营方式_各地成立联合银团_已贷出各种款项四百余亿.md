　　Private Money Shops Change Old Business Practices
　　United Syndicates Established in Various Places
　　Over 40 Billion in Various Loans Already Issued
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Currently, private money shops in various places are gradually changing their old business practices to adapt to the capital needs of industry, commerce, and agriculture. They are universally establishing joint deposit syndicates and joint lending offices. Under the guidance and assistance of the People's Bank of China, they are guiding financial businesses to operate legitimate businesses and diverting floating capital into legitimate production. Major cities across the country, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Hankou, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Hangzhou, as well as Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Suzhou in Southern Jiangsu, have successively established joint deposit and loan institutions for private money shops under the initiative and leadership of local People's Banks. Private banks and shops in Shanghai account for a large proportion of the national financial industry. Based on needs, in September of last year, they jointly organized a syndicate of private money shops, with 172 participating banks and shops, contributing 4 billion yuan (the lending target being the Shanghai Private Yarn Factory Joint Cotton Procurement Supply Office). However, due to the initial establishment of this organization, the capital was not abundant, the direction was not clear, and the creditworthiness of the participating factories in the cotton procurement office varied, the results were not entirely satisfactory. After the expiration of the cotton loan period, at the end of last year, the city's joint public-private lending office was reorganized, raising a total of 12 billion yuan (including 2.6 billion yuan from the People's Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications). Later, it was further increased to 18 billion yuan. As of the end of April this year, a total of 24.5 billion yuan (including principal and interest) had been loaned to the city's yarn and cloth, dyeing and weaving, cotton weaving, and tobacco industries, partially solving the difficulty of capital for legitimate private industrial production. At the same time, in March, 18 private banking firms in the city organized an agricultural loan syndicate to implement currency distribution in rural areas. In April, the "Shanghai Financial Industry Agricultural Loan Group" was established, with 32 banks already participating, with a total loan amount of 2.07 billion yuan. The loan plan has been drafted, and it is expected to play a certain role in agricultural production.
　　Following the example of private money shops in Shanghai changing their business practices, public and private financial institutions in Hangzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou and other cities also successively established joint lending offices and began issuing loans. Hangzhou organized 45 banks and money shops, with a total loan amount of 1.2 billion yuan. After 17 banks and shops and 11 banks in Wuxi were organized, they successively signed 1.4 billion yuan in fixed-term and current loan contracts with 14 textile factories in Southern Jiangsu as a unified purchase of raw cotton. The Suzhou Private Money Shop Joint Lending Office also began lending business activities to support legitimate private enterprises.
　　The Tianjin Private Banking Joint Syndicate was established in late April. In order to encourage its collective management policy, the National Bank signed a business contact contract with the Joint Syndicate (the contract is valid for three months, starting in May) and determined that the minimum amount of joint loans in May would be 6.56 billion yuan. The amount was deposited in a special account opened by the Tianjin People's Bank and has begun to be loaned out. The first batch of 3 billion yuan has been loaned to Yongli Company. In order to cooperate with the development of the new economic situation, the banks and shops in the city have organized five joint credit reserve associations in units of ten. The total deposit amount of the second reserve association in April was 10 billion yuan, and the loan amount was 7 billion yuan. In late April, the Tianjin People's Bank also established business contact contracts with Xinhua and other five private banks. Private banks and shops in Beijing were also established in late April, and the total loan amount was set at 3 billion yuan (including 600 million yuan from the Beijing People's Bank, 1.8 billion yuan from private banks, and 600 million yuan from private money shops).
　　In addition, Wuchang, Hankou, Jinan, Nanjing, and Qingdao have all organized joint lending offices and have successively begun issuing loans. In the two cities of Wuhan, as of April 12, 4.8 billion yuan in collateral loans had been issued. Later, after the lending office merged with the city's Textile Loan Committee, another 7.4 billion yuan was loaned. Within a month, the Nanjing Joint Lending Office loaned 1.5 billion yuan to Yongli Ya Factory, 150 million yuan to Xin Yi Dyeing and Weaving Factory, 300 million yuan to Pufeng Flour Factory, and 80 million yuan to Chu Da Company, solving their financial turnover difficulties.

　　私营银钱业改变旧经营方式
    各地成立联合银团     
    已贷出各种款项四百余亿
    【本报讯】目前各地私营银钱业已在逐渐改变旧的经营方式，适应工商业和农业的资金需要，普遍成立联合存放银团和联合放款处，在国家银行的指导与协助下，引导金融事业经营正当业务和疏导游资投向正当的生产。全国各大城市如上海、天津、北京、汉口、南京、济南、青岛、杭州，以及苏南之无锡、镇江和苏州等地，都先后在各地人民银行的发动与领导下，成立了私营银钱业联合存放款的机构。上海私营行庄在全国金融业中所占比重甚大，根据需要于去年九月即联合私营银钱业组织银团，参加行庄有一百七十二家，认放四十亿元（其放款对象为上海市私营纱厂联合购棉供款处）。但由于这个组织初步建立，资金不雄厚，方向不明确，和参加棉购处各厂商信用优劣不一，结果未尽美满。棉贷期满后，又于去年年底重新组织该市公私联合放款处，筹集资金总额一百二十亿元（内有人民银行、中国银行和交通银行参加二十六亿）。后又继续增为一百八十亿元。截至今年四月底止，先后贷放该市纱布业、染织、棉织、烟草等行业计二百四十五亿元（包括本息一并贷出），部分地解决了私营正当工业生产资金的困难。同时该市三月份十八家私营银行业组织了农贷银团，实行货币下乡；四月又成立了“上海金融业农业贷款团”，已有三十二家银行加入，贷款总额二十亿七千万元，贷款计划已拟就，预计对农业生产将起一定的作用。
    上海私营银钱业改变经营范例出现后，杭州、无锡、苏州等市公私营金融业也相继成立联合放款处，开始放款。杭州市组织了四十五家银行和钱庄，贷款总额为十二亿元。无锡十七家行庄和十一家银行组织起来后，先后与苏南区十四家纺织厂订立了十四亿元定期和活期放款合同，作为统购原棉之用途。苏州私营银钱业联合放款处亦开始放款业务活动，扶植正当私营企业。
    天津私营银行业联合银团于四月下旬成立，国家银行为鼓励其集体经营方针，与联合银团签订了业务联系合同（合同有效期为三个月，五月开始实行），并确定五月份联合贷款最低金额为六十五亿六千万元。该项款额交天津人民银行开立专户存款，已开始贷放，首批已贷与永利公司三十亿元。该市行庄为了配合新经济形势之发展，以十家为一单位已组织五个联合信用准备会。第二准备会四月份存款总额百亿元，放款额七十亿元。四月下旬，天津人民银行又与新华等五家私营银行建立了业务联系合同。北京市私营行庄亦已于四月下旬成立，放款总额订为三十亿元（内北京人民银行六亿元，私营银行十八亿元，私营钱庄六亿元）。
    此外，武昌、汉口、济南、南京和青岛都组织了联合放款处，已先后开始放款。武汉两市，截至四月十二日，已放出质押放款四十八亿元。后该放款处与该市纺织贷款委员会合并后，又贷出七十四亿元。南京联放处一月之中，贷给永利亚厂十五亿元，新毅染织厂一亿五千万元，普丰面粉厂三亿元，楚大公司八千万元，解决其资金周转困难。（康维中）
