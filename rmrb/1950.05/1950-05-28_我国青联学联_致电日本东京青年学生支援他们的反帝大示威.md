Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth and the All-China Students' Federation recently sent a telegram to Japanese youth and students in Tokyo, supporting their "May 16th" anti-imperialist demonstration. The telegram reads as follows:

To the Japan Youth Fatherland Front, the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation, and to the youth and students of Tokyo:

The "May 16th" anti-imperialist demonstration by the youth and students of Tokyo has once again exposed the sinister faces of foreign imperialists before the people of the world, and has powerfully struck at the imperialist plot to enslave the Japanese people and prepare to launch a new war. We, on behalf of the Chinese youth and students, extend our brotherly greetings to the youth and students of Tokyo! We believe that you will continue to stand together with the Japanese people and resolutely struggle against the colonization and militarization of Japan, for the early conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty, for national independence, and for the establishment of a people's democratic government. We will enthusiastically support you!
