　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st – After a continuous decline for more than two months, prices in Tianjin have now gradually stabilized. Several abnormal phenomena in the market caused by the price decline have also begun to normalize.

　　Prices in Tianjin began to fall in early March. According to the wholesale price index of 26 important commodities compiled by the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, compared with prices in early March, prices in early May fell by an average of slightly less than 27 percent, and began to stabilize in early May. The wholesale price index in early May only fell by slightly more than 2.8 percent compared with late April. The prices of some commodities have stabilized when comparing late April with early May.

　　The abnormal phenomena in the market, formed by continuous price increases over the past ten years or more, have begun to be reversed in the past two months. First of all, the supply of goods in the commodity market is becoming increasingly abundant. For example, the amount of grain on the market in March averaged more than 3 million catties per day, about one and a half times the volume of transactions. Speculative capital, which took advantage of rising prices in the past to profit, has basically withdrawn from the commodity market. Market transactions are generally based on actual sales. For example, the daily turnover of cotton cloth is 100 to 200 pieces, and the purchasers are mostly factories, out-of-town merchants, and merchants with actual sales. Secondly, the gap between retail prices and wholesale prices has narrowed. The retail prices of six commodities, including vermicelli, corn flour, Beihe millet, Erchang Wufu cloth, matches, and coal balls, fell by an average of slightly more than 36 percent from March 1 to May 10, about 1.35 times the percentage drop in wholesale prices. Thirdly, deposit and loan interest rates in the financial market have fallen with the stabilization of prices. From the end of February to the present, the daily interest rate on private banks' current loans has fallen from 21-23 yuan (February 28) to 1.56-1.6 yuan (May 17), a ratio of about 13 to 1. However, at the same time, bank deposits continue to increase: compared with the deposit balance at the end of February, the deposits of state-owned banks have increased by more than 1.7 times; the deposits of private banks have also increased by more than 48 percent. This shows that the credit of the Renminbi has been enhanced as never before.

　　In the process of price stabilization, some abnormal phenomena have also appeared in the market, such as unreasonable regional differences and exchange ratios between some commodities, as well as finished product prices being lower than costs, and state-owned companies' listed prices being higher than market prices. This is unavoidable when prices, which have been rising for a long time, are reversed.

　　In order to prevent the adverse impact of continued price declines on industrial and agricultural production, the state-owned trading companies and the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce in Tianjin have begun to take various effective measures, such as mastering stable price policies, appropriately purchasing some industrial products, and strengthening the management of certain public-owned purchasing and marketing units.

　　Thanks to these measures taken by the People's Government, prices have shifted to stability, and therefore some of the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena caused by the price decline are now gradually being eliminated. For example, the situation where the prices of red sorghum and corn from Chahar-Suiyuan and Shanhaiguan were higher than Tianjin prices has been eliminated, and private merchants have begun to find transportation and sales profitable. For another example, during the period of price declines, a large price difference once occurred between cotton cloth prices in Tianjin and Shanghai, which affected the sales of cotton cloth in Tianjin. Recently, under the correct control of state-owned trading companies, this difference has gradually narrowed, so that Tianjin-made cotton yarn can also be sold in the Tianjin market. Furthermore, the phenomenon of industrial finished product prices being lower than costs, which occurred in the past two months due to price declines, has also been alleviated and partially improved due to the opening of some sales channels and the purchases by state-owned trading companies (the North China Department Store alone invested more than 23 billion yuan in purchasing industrial products in April and early May).

　　The gap between listed prices and market prices has also gradually narrowed, and the market prices of some commodities are now higher than the listed prices. The stability of prices not only guarantees the stability of the lives of the broad masses of the working people, but also provides favorable prerequisites for the normal development of industry and commerce.

### 天津物价由落趋稳  市场情况逐渐正常

　　天津物价由落趋稳  市场情况逐渐正常
    【新华社天津二十一日电】天津市物价经两个多月来持续降落之后，现已渐趋稳定。市场上因物价下落而形成的若干不正常现象亦已趋向正常。
    津市物价三月初即开始下跌。根据津市工商局编制的二十六种重要商品的批发价格指数所示：以五月上旬与三月上旬物价相比，平均下降了百分之二十七弱，五月初起即日趋平稳。五月上旬的批发物价指数只较四月下旬下落了百分之二点八强。部分商品价格四月下旬与五月初旬比较，已呈稳定。
    过去十多年来由于物价不断上涨而形成的市场上的畸形现象，两个月来已被开始扭转。首先是商品市场上物资供应日益充裕。如三月份粮食市场上市量，平均每天达三百多万斤，约为成交量的一倍半。过去趁物价上涨而混水摸鱼的投机资本，基本上已退出商品市场。市场成交一般都是实销。如纱布交易每天成交一、二百件，购者多为工厂、外地客帮及实销的商户。其次是零售价格与批发价格的距离已经缩小。如通粉、玉米面、北河小米、二厂五福布、火柴、煤球六种商品的零售价，从三月一日到五月十日平均下降了百分之三十六强，约为批发物价下降百分比的一点三五倍。第三是金融市场的存放利率随着物价的平稳而下降。从二月底至今，私营行庄活期放款日息已从二一——二三元（二月二十八日）落到一点五六——一点六元（五月十七日），前后约为十三与一之比。但与此同时，银行存款却继续增加：以四月底与二月底的存款余额相比，国家银行的存款增加了一点七倍强；私营行庄的存款也增加了百分之四十八以上。这说明人民币的信用已空前提高。
    在物价稳定的过程中，市场上同时出现了一些不正常的现象，如地区差额和部分商品间的交换比率的不合理，以及成品价格低于成本，国营公司牌价高于市价等。这是十多年来物价长期上涨后一旦扭转过来时所难免的。
    为着防止物价的继续下跌对工农业生产的不利影响，津市各国营贸易公司和市工商局等有关部门，开始采取了各种有效措施，如掌握稳定的价格政策，适量地收购一部工业产品，以及加强对某些公营购销单位的管理等。
    由于人民政府的这些措施，物价已转趋稳定因而由于物价下跌所造成的上述某些不正常现象，目前已在逐渐消除。如察绥、山海关红粮、玉米价格高于津价的情形已经消除，私商运销已开始有利。又如津、沪间纱布价格在物价下跌期中曾经发生很大差额，以致影响津市纱布销路。最近在国营贸易公司的正确掌握下，这个差额已逐渐缩小，因而津货棉纱也能在天津市场内销售了。又如过去两个月以来由于物价下跌而发生的工业成品价格低于成本的现象，由于部分销路的打开以及国营贸易公司的收购（仅华北百货公司四月份和五月上旬投放于收购工业品的资金即达二百三十余亿元），亦已趋于缓和和部分好转。
    牌价与市价间的距离也已渐渐接近，有些商品市价已高于牌价。物价的平稳，不仅保证了广大劳动人民生活的安定，也使工商业的正常发展获得了有利前提。
