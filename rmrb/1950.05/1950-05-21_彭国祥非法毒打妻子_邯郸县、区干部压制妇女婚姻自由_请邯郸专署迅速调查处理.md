　　Peng Guoxiang Illegally Beat His Wife
    Handan County and District Cadres Suppressed Women's Freedom of Marriage
    Please Promptly Investigate and Handle by Handan Prefecture

Comrade Editor:

　　Guo Xiuqin is from Beiniu Zhao Village in Handan, Hebei. Due to poverty at a young age, her father sold her to Peng Guoxiang of Xida Tun, District Three, Handan County (who was 43 years old at the time) for 200 yuan in counterfeit money when she was sixteen. After the marriage, because the woman was too young to share the bed, Peng Guoxiang constantly beat her. After liberation, because Guo Xiuqin was elected as the chairman of the village women's association, Peng Guoxiang felt even more displeased. He was also provoked by his brother, Peng Fuxiang, and often scolded her: "You attend meetings all the time, how many times have you slept with others?" And he constantly beat her. Xiuqin's awareness grew day by day, and she felt that she could not endure such insults and beatings. Therefore, on the fifth day of the second lunar month this year, she went to the District Three office to file for divorce from the man. She arrived at the district office after breakfast and waited until late afternoon before they issued a subpoena, asking the woman to return to the village to summon the man. Xiuqin gave the subpoena to the village chief, Wang Zhengzhen, who privately suppressed the subpoena without informing the man. On the sixth day of the second lunar month, Xiuqin went to the district office to complain again, but the district office did not inquire and gave the woman another subpoena, asking her to summon the man again. Xiuqin gave the subpoena to the village chief again, but the village chief still did not summon the man according to the subpoena. Instead, he told Peng Guoxiang privately that Xiuqin had gone to the district office to sue him. On the morning of the seventh day of the second lunar month, Xiuqin went to the district office again. Before she had gone halfway, Peng Guoxiang caught up with her and dragged her back. Fortunately, neighbors intervened, and she was not beaten. She wanted to find the village chief to ask what was going on. But as soon as she went out, she was pulled back by Peng Guoxiang, who bolted the door, tore off Xiuqin's clothes, hung her on the paulownia tree in the courtyard, and whipped her with a rope. When someone came to knock on the door to stop the fight, Peng Fuxiang cursed loudly. Later, when more people came to visit, he released Xiuqin and carried her into the house. But after everyone left, he stuffed Xiuqin's mouth with cloth, tied her arms and legs, and beat her with hemp ropes until she fainted, then woke her up with cold water.

　　Later, Guo Xiuqin was taken back to her parents' home in Beiniu Zhao by her father. Fearing that her husband would call her back to her in-laws' house, she secretly went to the home of her godmother, Liu Xiurong (a female village chief), in Xixie Zhuang, Handan Town. On the 24th day of the third lunar month, she went to the Handan County government with her godmother to complain. The Judicial Section of the Handan County government not only did not patiently understand the situation and quickly investigate and handle it, but instead said: "Why didn't you wait for the district to handle it before coming to the county? Go back to the district, we don't care." Guo Xiuqin repeatedly said that she was afraid of being beaten to death by Peng Guoxiang if she went back. The comrades of the county government said: "You are quite bold, daring to come to the county government casually! If it doesn't work, I think you would even dare to go to the prefectural court." Xiuqin and her godmother waited at the county government for a long time, saying many good words, before the county government made a phone call to the district. But the district said: "We can't handle it, you handle it." The Judicial Section of the county government then issued a subpoena to Xiuqin, asking her to summon the man. Xiuqin was afraid of being beaten to death if she went back, and asked the government to send a messenger to go with her. But the people in the county told Guo Xiuqin: "We don't have a messenger. If you don't summon him, then don't file a lawsuit."

　　Our government's laws guaranteeing human rights have already been promulgated, and the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China has also been promulgated. An event like Peng Guoxiang beating his wife to the point of near death not only violates the laws guaranteeing human rights but also violates the laws on freedom of marriage. The District Three office of Handan County and the Handan County government not only adopted an irresponsible attitude towards this matter but also used various methods to suppress Guo Xiuqin's legitimate request for divorce. This is a completely bureaucratic attitude. We hope that the county will quickly investigate and handle it.

    Editor's Note: Judging from the letter written by Comrade Shi Chengzhang, the phenomenon of women's lack of freedom of marriage and lack of guaranteed rights is extremely serious. The facts in the letter show that the Marriage Law will definitely not be implemented smoothly; in order to implement the Marriage Law, the high-ranking cadres of the People's Government, the Communist Party, and people's organizations must conduct in-depth propaganda to their subordinate organizations and the masses of the people, conduct serious struggles against those who violate laws, oppress women, and despise human rights, and earnestly protect women's rights so that women will not suffer various unexpected dangers in the struggle. We hope that the Handan Prefecture will promptly investigate and handle the issues raised by Comrade Shi Chengzhang and inform this newspaper of the results.

　　彭国祥非法毒打妻子
    邯郸县、区干部压制妇女婚姻自由
    请邯郸专署迅速调查处理编辑同志：
    郭秀琴，河北邯郸北牛召村人，幼时家贫，十六岁上被父亲以二百元伪钞卖给邯郸县三区西大屯彭国祥（当时他已四十三岁）为妻。结婚后因女方年岁太小，不能同床，彭国祥就不断打她。解放以后，彭国祥因郭秀琴当选了村妇女会主席，更觉看不惯，又受其兄彭福祥的挑拨，就常常骂她：“你常常开会，给人家睡了几回？”并且不断的打她。秀琴的觉悟程度一天天提高，感到不能忍受这样的污辱和打骂，便于今年旧历二月初五日到三区区公所提出和男方离婚。她早饭后到区上，一直等到半下午才给开了一个传票，叫女方回村传唤男方。秀琴把传票给了村长，村长王正真私自将传票压下，没有告诉男方。旧历二月初六日秀琴又到区上控诉，区上也不加询问，又给女方一张传票，要她再去传唤。秀琴又把传票给了村长，村长还是不按传票去传男方，却用私人名义告诉彭国祥，说秀琴已到区上去告他。旧历二月初七早上秀琴又到区上去，还没走到半路，就被彭国祥追上，把她拖了回来；幸有邻居相劝，没有挨打。她想找村长，问他到底是怎么一回事。但刚一出门，就被彭国祥拉了回来，把门闩上，将秀琴的衣服拉下，吊在院里的梧桐树上用绳子抽打。有人来喊门劝架，彭福祥却破口大骂。后来探望的人多了，他才把秀琴放下来，抬到屋里。可是等人们都走了以后，他又用布将秀琴的嘴堵住，并拴住她的胳膊、腿，用麻绳子打她，直把她打得昏过去，又用凉水喷醒。
    郭秀琴后来被父亲接到北牛召娘家。她怕丈夫再把她叫回婆家，就偷偷的到了邯郸镇西谢庄她干娘刘秀荣（是个女村长）家。旧历三月廿四日她跟她干娘一起到邯郸县政府去控诉。邯郸县政府司法科不但不耐心的了解情况，迅速调查处理，反而说：“你为啥不等区上处理就来县上？回区上去吧，我们不管。”郭秀琴一再说回去怕被彭国祥打死。县政府的同志却说：“你这胆子可不小，竟随便就到县政府来！再不行，我看你还敢到专署法院去哩。”秀琴和她干娘一直在县政府等了好久，不知说了多少好话，县府才给区上打了个电话。可是区上说：“我们处理不了，你们处理吧。”县政府司法科随即又给秀琴开了个传票，叫秀琴去传唤男方。秀琴怕回去被打死，请政府派通信员同去。而县里的人却对郭秀琴说：“我们没有通信员，你不去传他就别打官司。”
    我们政府保障人权的法令早已公布，中华人民共和国婚姻法也已公布了。像彭国祥这样将老婆打得死去活来的事件，不但违犯了保障人权的法令，也违犯了婚姻自由的法令。邯郸县三区区公所和邯郸县政府却对此事不但采取不负责任的态度，反而用各种方法压制郭秀琴的正当的离婚要求。这是一种十足官僚主义的态度。希望县里迅速检查处理。
                           邯郸镇委宣传部  史成章
    编者按：从史成章同志所写的信来看，妇女婚姻不自由和权利无保障的现象极为严重。信里的事实表明：婚姻法决不是可以风平浪静地实行的；为了实行婚姻法，人民政府共产党和人民团体的高级干部，必须向所属各级组织和人民群众进行深入的宣传，向违反法令、压迫妇女、轻视人权的分子进行严肃的斗争，并认真保护妇女权利，使妇女在斗争中不致遭受各种意外的危险。史成章同志所说的问题，望邯郸专署迅速调查处理，并将结果告诉本报。
