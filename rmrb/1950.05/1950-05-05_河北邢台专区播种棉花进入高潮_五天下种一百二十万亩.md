Hebei Xingtai Prefecture's cotton planting campaign has reached its climax. The entire prefecture's cotton planting task this year is over 2.04 million mu. Sowing began on April 17th, and by April 21st, in just five days, 1.2 million mu had been sown, completing over 60% of the prefecture's task. By April 25th, various counties were nearing completion of their tasks.

On April 10th, the Prefectural Party Committee and Administrative Office dispatched 300 cadres to the countryside. After rains on the 15th and 16th, nine counties, including Wei County, Shahe, Pingxiang, and Ningjin, seized the opportunity to plant after the rain, dispatching over 370 additional cadres to villages and households to specifically inspect cotton planting plans. During the inspection, it was first discovered that the majority of the masses harbored the mistaken idea of not daring to get rich in a big way. Targeting these ideological issues, work teams used various forms, such as blackboards, street poetry, broadcasting, large meetings, and small meetings, to carry out propaganda and education on production policies, burden policies, and the protection of labor income and guarantee of land and property rights. By using concrete accounting methods, they broke the farmers' conservative ideas of self-sufficiency. A "four comparisons" movement (comparing seed soaking, comparing early planting, comparing more planting, comparing technology) quickly unfolded in various places. In counties such as Longyao and Julu, cotton planting committees were established in each village, divided into inspection, propaganda, and technical guidance sections, and labor heroes, models, and technical experts were absorbed to participate, directly promoting intensive farming, increased fertilization, seed selection, and seed sorting. At the same time, various counties also loaned out large quantities of cotton seeds.

Ningjin loaned out over 100,000 jin of cotton seeds the day after the rain. Longyao loaned out 400,000 jin, and Baixiang 300,000 jin, delivering the cotton seeds to the masses in the rain. According to statistics from nine counties, over 2 million jin of cotton seeds have been loaned, sold, and exchanged. In order to dispel the masses' ideological concerns after borrowing seeds, germination tests were carried out in various places. The results of the germination rate test in Shilipu Village, Nangong, were over 70%. The masses said one after another: "With such a test, we will have a clearer idea in our minds when sowing."

In mobilizing cotton planting, cadres in various places, due to their firm confidence in leading cotton planting, adopted effective measures. Wei County convened meetings at all levels from the county to the district and village, first affirming the favorable conditions for cotton planting this year, launching a campaign to evaluate merits and elect models, and proposing that leading cadres establish the slogan of new heroism. This year, the cotton planting task in the county is over 430,000 mu, accounting for over 34% of the cultivated land, and now cotton planting is to reach 36%. Wei County, Nangong, and Julu counties account for over 50% of the entire prefecture's cotton planting task. In the five days up to April 21st, these three counties had sown over 50%, and are expected to complete all tasks by the end of April. In Ren County, the masses did not have the habit of planting cotton in previous years, but this year it may exceed the prescribed task by more than 8,000 mu. The cotton planting task of 15,000 mu in 45 villages in the Fourth District was sown to 17,829 mu in five days. The cotton planting task of 46,000 mu in six districts of Xingtai County has been sown to 42,576 mu, accounting for 93% of the task. The First District may exceed the task by more than 2,000 mu. Shahe is striving to exceed the task by 7,000 mu of cotton.

　　河北邢台专区播种棉花进入高潮
    五天下种一百二十万亩
    【邢台讯】河北省邢台专区植棉运动进入高潮。全专区今年种棉任务为二百零四万余亩，从四月十七日开始播种，截至二十一日止，仅五天时间，已下种一百二十万亩，完成专区任务的百分之六十以上，到二十五日各县已接近完成任务。
    四月十日地委专署抽出三百名干部下乡。十五、六两日下雨后，威县、沙河、平乡、宁晋等九个县为趁雨抢种，即抽出了三百七十余名干部深入到村、户，具体检查种棉计划。检查中，首先发现了有大部群众思想上存在着不敢大发家的错误思想，工作团针对着这些思想情况，采用黑板报、街头诗、广播筒、大会、小会等不同形式，进行了生产政策、负担政策、保护劳动所得与保障地权财权的宣传教育。用具体算账的方法，打破了农民自给自足的保守思想。各地迅速的开展起四比运动（比浸种、比早种、比多种、比技术）。隆尧、巨鹿等县各村成立了植棉委员会，内分检查、宣传、技术指导，并吸收了劳动英雄模范、技术能手参加，直接推动了细作多施肥、拣种、选种等工作。同时各县又大量贷出棉种。
    宁晋雨后一天就贷出花种十万余斤。隆尧四十万斤、柏乡三十万斤，冒雨就把花种贷到群众手里。据九个县的统计已贷、售、换出花种二百余万斤。为了解除群众贷种后的思想顾虑，各地发动作了发芽的试验。南宫十里铺村试验发芽率的结果在百分之七十以上。群众纷纷说：这样一试验，在下种时心里就有底了。
    发动进行播种棉花中，由于各地干部对领导种棉树立了坚强的信心，采取了有效措施。威县从县到区、村逐级召开了会议，首先肯定了今年的种棉有利条件，开展了评功选举模范运动，提出领导干部要树立新英雄主义的口号。该县今年种棉任务四十三万余亩，占耕地的百分之三十四强，现在种棉要达到百分之三十六。威县、南宫、巨鹿三县种棉任务占全专区种棉任务的百分之五十以上，至四月二十一日五天的时间该三县就下种百分之五十以上，四月底即可全部完成。任县往年群众没有植棉习惯，今年可超过规定任务八千多亩，四区四十五个村的种花任务一万五千亩，五天中播种到一万七千八百二十九亩。邢台县六个区植棉任务四万六千亩，已下种四万二千五百七十六亩，占任务的百分之九十三。一区可超过任务的二千多亩。沙河正为超过任务七千亩棉而努力。
