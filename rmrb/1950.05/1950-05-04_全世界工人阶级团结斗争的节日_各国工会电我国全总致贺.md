The General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea stated in its telegram: "On the occasion of celebrating the May Day Labor Day when the working people of the world review their fighting forces, we, the Korean working class, wish you - the heroic Chinese working class under the leadership of the Communist Party of China - even greater development of the great revolutionary victory won, and new victories and successes; we wish you new victories and successes in your work to improve the material and cultural life of the people for the future prosperity of the People's Republic of China."

　　[Reported by this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: Moraru, Secretary-General of the International Transport Workers' Trade Union affiliated to the World Federation of Trade Unions, Aubert, Secretary-General of the French Textile Workers' Trade Union, and Apostol, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Romanian Trade Union Federation, all sent telegrams to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, congratulating International Labor Day and wishing the great Chinese working class success in building a new China and defending world peace.
　　[Reported by this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The delegation of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Workers in Beijing sent a letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to be forwarded to our country's workers in celebration of the May 1st International Labor Day. The letter generally stated as follows:
　　On the occasion of the May 1st International Labor Day, we, on behalf of the Indonesian General Federation of Trade Unions, extend our fraternal greetings to our comrades. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, this is the first time that comrades, together with the people of the whole country, have been able to freely celebrate the day of victory for workers around the world.
　　The Chinese people, under the leadership of the working class, have been victorious in the revolution that crushed imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism. The consolidation of the People's Republic of China is strengthened by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, and the consolidation of the People's Republic of China also strengthens the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. These are the things we have seen during our stay in China; we have learned a lot.
　　Your struggle has pointed out the victorious path for Indonesia's revolutionary struggle against imperialism and its henchmen. Your efforts to build a new democratic society under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Chairman Mao Zedong have strengthened the unity and friendship of workers all over the world under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions; this will make the working class of imperialist countries and the working class of colonial and semi-colonial countries unite more closely, and become the guarantee for the victory of the independent struggle of the Indonesian people and other colonial and semi-colonial countries.

　　全世界工人阶级团结斗争的节日
    各国工会电我国全总致贺
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：自由德国工会联合会中央委员会、匈牙利工会中央委员会、阿尔巴尼亚工会中央委员会、北朝鲜职业总同盟、全缅工会大会等致电中华全国总工会祝贺“五一”劳动节。自由德国工会联合会中央委员会来电称：“欣逢国际五一劳动节——全世界工人阶级的战斗日——之际，自由德国工会联合会中央委员会谨向你们致团结的兄弟般的敬礼！
    在世界工联领导之下，一切国家工人行动的团结一致是劳动人民的和平、安全、社会进步，以及一切权利和自由的保证。”匈牙利工会中央委员会来电称：“欣逢五一劳动节——全世界工人阶级的劳动与和平节日——我们代表有组织的全体匈牙利工人，谨向你们致兄弟的敬礼。祝你们更进一步的胜利，并为加强以苏联为领导的和平阵营而共同奋斗。”阿尔巴尼亚工会中央委员会来电称：“欣逢五月一日，全世界工人为团结而斗争的节日，谨以阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级名义向你们致意，请将我们热诚的敬礼转致所有的中国工人，在增强以伟大的苏联为首的和平阵营的斗争中，祝你们获得新的胜利！”北朝鲜职业总同盟来电称：“在庆祝全世界劳动人民检阅战斗力量的五一劳动节日的时候，我们朝鲜工人阶级祝你们——在中国共产党领导下的英雄的中国工人阶级赢得的伟大革命胜利的更加发展，并获得新的胜利与成功；祝你们为中华人民共和国的未来繁荣而进行的改进人民物质与文化生活的工作，获得新的胜利与成功。”全缅工会大会来电称：“欣逢五一劳动节之际，全缅工会大会代表缅甸工人阶级，谨向中国劳动人民致兄弟的敬礼！并坚决表示为争取人类和平、民主及自由而斗争的决心。”
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：世界工联所属的运输工人工会国际总书记莫拉鲁、法国纺织工会总书记奥贝特及罗马尼亚职工总会中央委员会主席阿波斯托尔，均致电中华全国总工会，庆贺国际劳动节，并祝伟大的中国工人阶级在建设新中国及保卫世界和平中的成功。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：在北京之全印尼工人中央组织代表团为迎接五一国际劳动节曾致函中华全国总工会转我国工人，该函大意如下：
    欣逢五一国际劳动节，我们代表印尼总工会向同志们致兄弟的敬礼，自从中华人民共和国成立以来，同志们第一次和全国人民一起能够自由地来庆祝全世界工人胜利日。
    中国人民在工人阶级领导下已经在粉碎帝国主义、官僚资本主义和封建主义统治的革命中得到胜利。中华人民共和国的巩固为中苏友好条约所加强，中华人民共和国的巩固，同时也加强了以苏联为首的和平民主阵营。这些东西都是我们在居留中国期间所看到的；我们学习了很多东西。
    同志们的斗争，给印尼的反抗帝国主义及其爪牙的革命斗争指引了胜利的道路。同志们在中国共产党和毛泽东主席同志领导下努力地建设新民主主义社会，这加强了由世界工联领导的全世界工人的团结和友好；这将使得帝国主义国家之工人阶级和殖民地、半殖民地国家的工人阶级更紧密地团结起来，而成为印度尼西亚人民和其他殖民地国家半殖民地国家独立斗争胜利的保障。
