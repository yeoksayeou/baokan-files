　　Rapidly Resolve Civil Disputes
    Shouyang Judicial Cadres Go to the Countryside for Trials
    [This Dispatch from Shouyang] In order to improve the efficiency of judicial work and reduce the losses of the masses caused by litigation, such as lost work, expenses, and delays in production, the Shouyang County People's Government of Shanxi Province has organized judicial cadres to implement rotational trials in the countryside since late April. Before going to the countryside, the county's Judicial Section first made preparations, drafted a plan, and submitted it to the county government's political affairs meeting for approval. It was decided to first conduct rotational trials in the fifth district, using Qinquan Town as the base village. The Judicial Section also held a taxation meeting to study the specific methods of carrying out the work. The local district government and the base village were notified three days in advance, so that the district government could notify the people in nearby villages in advance. After the judicial cadres arrived in the village, they used the local village people's congress and cadre meetings that were being held to convey various policies, especially the Marriage Law and the strict prohibition of gambling and drugs, and explained the purpose of the judicial cadres going to the countryside, requesting representatives and cadres to go back and publicize it to the masses.

    In the first rotational trial, due to prior preparation and publicity, many villagers came to apply for resolving disputes. A total of thirty-two cases were received and concluded in five days. Among them, marriage disputes and debt cases were the most numerous, each accounting for ten cases. A total of one hundred and forty people were involved in the cases. If these cases were sent to the county for resolution, it is estimated that each party would have to spend at least two hundred and eighty more days of work. At the same time, the judicial cadres' in-depth involvement in the countryside enabled long-standing civil disputes to be resolved quickly, and on-the-spot investigations were more detailed. For example, Li Fengni and Zhao Quanfu were not on good terms, and the woman was often abused and beaten by the man. In the autumn of the year before last, the woman had five teeth knocked out and had attempted suicide several times. Last year, the woman filed for divorce, but it has not been resolved. In this circuit trial, after the judicial cadres had a thorough understanding of the situation, they correctly handled the property and child custody issues after the divorce in accordance with the Marriage Law, and persuaded the man to agree to the divorce. Another example is the divorce case between Su Jinzhong and Fan Fenglian (which had been mediated by the village government but not resolved). After investigation, it was found that the two parties had a good relationship on weekdays, but they quarreled and fought because of an accidental incident, and both parties angrily demanded a divorce. The judicial cadres patiently conducted education, and the man made a self-criticism of his mistake of hitting someone. Both parties changed their attitudes and returned to live together, as harmonious as before. The circuit trial is also of great educational significance to the masses. On the one hand, it enables the listening masses to understand the government's policies; on the other hand, it makes the masses' understanding of the People's Government a step higher. Many people reflected: "It is really a good thing for the judicial section to go to the countryside to solve problems for the people." (Shouyang County People's Government)

　　迅速解决民间纠纷
    寿阳司法干部下乡审讯
    【本报寿阳讯】山西省寿阳县人民政府为提高司法工作效率，减少群众因诉讼而引起的误工、费钱、耽误生产等损失，于四月下旬起组织司法工作干部，实行下乡轮回审讯。下乡前，县司法科首先作了准备，拟具计划，提交县府政务会议通过，决定首先到第五区以芹泉镇为基点村进行轮回审讯。司法科又召开税务会议，研究了进行工作的具体办法。在三天前通知了当地区政府和基点村，让区政府预先通知附近村庄的人民。司法干部到村后，又利用当地正在举行的村人代会和干部会议，传达了各种政策，特别提出了婚姻法以及严禁赌博、严禁毒品等项，并说明司法干部下乡的目的，要求各代表、干部回去向群众进行宣传。
    在首次轮回审讯中，因预先作了准备、宣传，村民前来申请解决纠纷的很多。五天共收结案件三十二起。其中以婚姻纠纷和债务案最多，各占十件。与各案有关当事人共达一百四十名。这些案件若送县解决，估计各当事人最少要多花工夫共二百八十余日。同时，由于司法干部深入农村，使民间存在多年的纠纷能迅速解决，而且就地调查，更为翔实。如李凤妮与赵全福夫妇不和，女方常受男方虐待殴打。前年秋天，女方被打掉五个牙齿，曾数度企图自杀。去年该女提出离婚，迄未解决。在这次巡回审讯中，经司法干部深入了解情况，依照婚姻法正确处理了离婚后的财产与子女抚养问题，说服了男方同意离婚。又如苏金中与范凤莲离婚案（曾经村政府调解，未解决的），经查悉双方平素感情很好，不过因偶然事故吵打了一场，双方气忿要求离婚。司法干部耐心进行了教育，男方检讨了打人的错误。双方转变了态度，回去同居，和好如初。下乡审讯对群众教育意义也很大。一方面使旁听群众了解政府的政策；另方面使群众对人民政府的认识更提高一步。许多人反映：“司法科下乡给老百姓解决问题，真是件好事。”（寿阳县人民政府）
