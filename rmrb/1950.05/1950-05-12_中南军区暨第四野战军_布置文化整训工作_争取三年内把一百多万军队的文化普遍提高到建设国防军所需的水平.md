At the beginning of the conference, Tao Zhu, Director of the Political Department of the Central South Military Region and Fourth Field Army, delivered a report entitled "On the Political and Cultural Rectification of the Troops." In his report, Director Tao called on the attendees to study diligently so that within three years, the cultural and scientific knowledge of over one million troops could be universally raised to the level required for building a national defense force. During the conference, Tan Zheng, Third Political Commissar of the Central South Military Region and Fourth Field Army, addressed the meeting. He gave specific explanations on the general policy and requirements for the rectification of the entire army and emphasized that cultural education is the key to building our national defense force and the means to master modern military technology. All departments must earnestly strive to complete it. Zhao Yimin, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Pan Zinian, Minister of Education of the Central South Military and Political Committee, both attended the meeting and spoke, unanimously expressing that they would mobilize the entire Party in Central South and governments at all levels to do everything possible to assist the troops in overcoming the difficulties in cultural rectification, just as they supported the front lines in the past. During the conference, relevant departments also gave reports on "Report on Strengthening the Literary and Art Work of the Troops" and "Report on the Work of Building Regiments in the Troops." Finally, Wang Lanxi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central South Military Region and Fourth Field Army Political Department, gave a summary report. He pointed out that the central task of the troops' political work in the future should be to strengthen ideological education and cultural education. The conference unanimously endorsed the resolution of the Central South Military Region and Fourth Field Army senior cadre meeting on the tasks for 1950 and immediately mobilized all army propaganda workers to actively prepare to transfer more than one million people in the entire army to cultural rectification in the second half of the year. The attendees unanimously agreed that the general policy and requirements for cultural rectification for the entire army should be to universally raise the cultural level of soldiers to the level of higher primary school and cadres to the level of junior high school within three years, and clearly recognized that after the troops officially enter cultural rectification, the entire army should focus on cultural education, with cadre study as the focus of cultural education, so that each of the 80,000 cadres of worker and peasant origin in the entire army has the opportunity to study off-the-job for one year and make up for their studies for two years while taking into account their work. To this end, the entire army should rapidly open various schools, especially accelerated schools at the corps, military region, army, and division levels, and quickly regularize them, establishing a certain education system and learning progress.
