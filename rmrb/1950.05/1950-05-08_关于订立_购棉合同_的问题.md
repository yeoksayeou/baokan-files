　　On the Question of Concluding "Cotton Purchase Contracts"

　　Editor:
　　This year, some cotton-producing areas are piloting the practice of signing "cotton purchase contracts" with cotton farmers. What is the purpose of signing such contracts? What are the benefits?

　　Reader Lufang

　　Comrade Lufang:

　　Answer: This year, Hebei Province and Pingyuan Province, in guiding cotton planting, have proposed a method of having supply and marketing cooperatives sign "cotton purchase contracts" with cotton farmers. In the autumn, cotton farmers deliver cotton according to the specifications in the contract, and the supply and marketing cooperatives supply the people with necessities according to the contract. The purpose of promoting this method is to eliminate the concerns of cotton farmers in some areas, implement the cotton price policy, and encourage cotton farmers to plant cotton without reservation. However, the significance of this contract system is not limited to this. First, signing cotton purchase contracts in conjunction with agricultural loan work can improve the organization of village cooperatives, gradually lay the foundation for joint transportation and marketing work, reduce the procedures of market transactions, eliminate intermediate exploitation, save manpower and materials in the acquisition process, and increase the people's interest in cooperation by actually increasing farmers' income. Second, the cotton purchase contract is carried out in a way that is led by establishing layers from the bottom up. Cotton farmers and village cooperatives sign contracts, village cooperatives then sign contracts with county supply and marketing cooperatives, and county supply and marketing cooperatives or special district supply and marketing cooperatives then sign contracts with cotton yarn and cloth companies. In this way, from farmers to villages, counties, and special districts, cotton production plans can be determined according to the contract; cotton yarn and cloth companies can determine cotton purchase plans according to the actual situation of cotton purchase contracts at all levels, and then sign supply and marketing contracts with various public and private cotton mills to ensure the supply of cotton raw materials, and then, from top to bottom, adjust and supply grain and fuel in a timely manner to solve the people's needs for grain, coal, agricultural tools, fertilizers, and other necessities. This will be able to strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in a planned way. Third, the masses sell cotton according to the specifications of the contract, which makes it easy to carry out cotton grading and inspection work in the producing area, prevents middlemen from adding water and adulterating, gradually improves the quality of cotton, and makes cotton commodities meet the specifications, which not only improves the textile value in China, but also guarantees trade credibility when exported in the future.

　　Currently, Pingyuan and Hebei are focusing on piloting the method of signing cotton purchase contracts, which cotton farmers think is very good. The Wu'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed cotton purchase contracts with farmers in the county's eighth district, which not only quickly completed the cotton planting task, but also is confident of exceeding the task.

　　关于订立“购棉合同”的问题编辑同志：
    今年有些产棉地区，在试行与棉农订立“购棉合同”，订立这种合同的目的是什么？有些什么好处？    
    读者  陆方陆方同志：
    答：今年河北省、平原省在领导种棉工作中，提出了由供销社和棉农订立“购棉合同”的办法，秋后棉农按合同的规格交棉花，供销社按合同供给群众的生活必需品。推行这个办法的目的，是消除某些地区棉农的思想顾虑，贯彻棉价政策，鼓励棉农放手种棉。但是，这种合同制的意义还不仅此。首先，订立购棉合同结合农贷工作，可以健全村合作社的组织，逐步打好共同运销工作的基础；缩减集市的买卖手续，免除中间剥削；在收购过程中节省了人力物力；在实际增加农民收益中能提高群众的合作兴趣。第二、订购棉合同是有领导的通过由下而上层层建立的方式进行，棉农和村合作社签订合同，村社再和县供销社签订合同，县供销社或专区供销社再和花纱布公司签订合同，这样由农民以至村、县、专区便可根据合同来确定棉花生产计划；花纱布公司可根据各层购棉合同的实际情况确定棉花的收购计划，更与各公私营纱厂签订供销合同，保障棉花原料的供应，然后再由上而下的做到粮食、燃料的调剂供应，及时的解决群众对粮、煤、农具、肥料以及其他必需品的需要。这样就能够有计划的加强城乡物资交流。第三、群众按合同的规格交售棉花，使在产地的棉花分级检验工作容易进行，防止了中间商人的掺水掺杂，逐渐提高棉花品质，使棉花商品合于规格，不但在国内提高纺织价值，将来出口时也可以保证贸易上的信誉。
    现在，平原、河北正有重点地试行订立购棉合同办法，棉农认为很好。武安县供销社到该县八区和农民签订了购棉合同，不但很快的完成了种棉任务，还有把握争取超过任务。                        编者
