    China Textile Construction Company Exceeds Production Plan for Yarn and Cloth Last Month
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th] The total production value of factories and mines under the Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee exceeded the original plan by 1.9% in April. Among them, major products such as bituminous coal, pyrite, steel ingots and cast steel, steel, cold-rolled vehicles, motors, transformers, bare copper wire, light bulbs, sulfuric acid, electrical porcelain, refractory bricks, and egg products have all exceeded the plan. Among the units that did not complete the plan, some mechanical, chemical, and light industrial units had difficulties in business, while Wusong and Qiujiang Machine Factories suffered from poor management.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th] Shanghai China Textile Construction Company's yarn and cloth production in April has exceeded the planned target. The output of cotton yarn exceeded the plan by nearly 5%, approaching the company's highest monthly cotton yarn production record; the output of cotton cloth exceeded the plan by 1.2%, reaching the company's highest monthly cotton cloth production level before and after liberation. The company's production policy after liberation has gradually shifted to the production of coarse yarn and 12-pound sheeting to meet the needs of the vast domestic market. In April, 20-count yarn accounted for 55% of the total yarn production; 75.3% of the cotton cloth produced was 12-pound military cloth and sheeting.
