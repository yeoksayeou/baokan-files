　　Closely Integrating Creation with Production and Construction
　　New Development in Northeast China's New Literature and Art
　　Performing Arts Troupes and Literary and Art Workers Go Deep into Factories and Rural Areas
    【Xinhua News Agency News】 Shenyang News: In the past year, literary and artistic work in the Northeast region has seen new development. Since the Northeast Literary and Art Workers Representative Conference was held last winter, most provinces have successively convened provincial, municipal, and county literary and art workers representative conferences, and established preparatory organizations for local federations of literary and art circles. Although some provinces and cities have not formally convened, they have also convened representative meetings. At the meetings, in addition to conveying the spirit of the Northeast Literary and Art Congress, they also discussed and arranged future work based on the specific conditions of the local area. During this year's Spring Festival activities, it can be seen that literary and artistic work in the Northeast has been greatly strengthened compared to the past. According to incomplete statistics from three cities and ninety-two counties: a total of 4,316 amateur drama troupes participated in the Spring Festival activities (approximately twice as many as last year), 1,367 Yangge teams, and 2,367 types of original dramas, Yangge, etc.
    The main achievement of literary and artistic work in Northeast China is that the content of creation is more closely integrated with the current tasks of production and construction. For example, in the second Workers' Literary and Art Activity Week held in the Lushun-Dalian area at the end of February, the programs performed all incorporated new themes of production and construction, reflecting the production enthusiasm of workers and peasants. Among them, the "Loading and Unloading" performed by the workers of the Heizuizi Wharf was particularly popular with the audience. Jilin, Rehe, Liaodong and other provinces have also launched literary and artistic activities in coordination with production and construction. Many literary and artistic workers have written many excellent works in factories and rural areas, which have greatly promoted practical work. In the past, some leading cadres in certain areas did not pay attention to literary and artistic work. Through the cooperation of literary and artistic workers and administrative work, literary and artistic work has increased the production enthusiasm of the masses and increased production efficiency. Administrative personnel and the masses have a new understanding of literary and artistic work. Therefore, amateur literary and artistic activities have developed rapidly. For example, the number of amateur drama troupes in Shenyang City has increased from 193 at the end of last year to 350, with more than 12,700 participants; an average of more than 520 performances per month, with an audience of approximately 500,000. According to statistics from only fifteen counties in Songjiang Province, more than 500 drama troupes have been developed in the past three months. The number of drama troupes in Liaoxi Province has increased from 828 last year to more than 2,300. The combination of local federations of literary and art circles, professional performing arts troupes, and amateur drama troupes has also achieved great results. For example, the above-mentioned drama "Loading and Unloading," which has been unanimously praised by the audience, was created and performed with the workers as the main body, with the help of professional literary and artistic workers. Local federations of literary and art circles and professional performing arts troupes have also formed literary and artistic work groups to go deep into the countryside to help farmers carry out amateur literary and artistic activities. Some provincial and county federations of literary and art circles have also held training courses to transfer mass literary and artistic workers for study, which has played a great role in carrying out amateur literary and artistic activities. Some districts and villages in Songjiang Province have established drama troupes through people's congresses and actively carried out literary and artistic movements; Liaoxi Province has organized publicity through representatives of labor model conferences and has people with prestige among the masses responsible for leadership, which are all good working methods. Various places have widely carried out the work of uniting old artists and reforming old operas. There are a total of 3,864 old artists in the entire Northeast. Now most cities and counties have established opera improvement associations, Quyi research associations, and shadow play artist training classes to further transform their thinking. In the writing and revision of scripts, various places have mostly adopted the method of cooperating with old artists.
　　　　There are still shortcomings and biases that need to be corrected
    There are still many shortcomings and biases in literary and artistic work in Northeast China, such as naturalism and formalism in creation. This is because some writers still use old viewpoints to observe new problems and new characters. There are also some incorrect views on raising standards, and they do not start from the requirements and levels of the masses. The diversity of creative themes and forms is also insufficient, especially the lack of full use of folk literary and artistic forms. Regarding the issue of transforming old artists, some places have experienced the bias of acute diseases, and have not realized the arduous process of transformation work. In the future, literary and artistic work in Northeast China will be carried out in a more planned and organized manner. At present, in addition to continuing to establish and improve the literary federations of various provinces, cities, and counties, the Literary Writers Association has more than 60 professional writers and amateur writers who have put forward creative plans. The plan is to create more than 80 types of dramas, operas, novels, poems, scripts, etc., and to organize writing groups with experienced writers as the core. In order to widely carry out mass literary and artistic activities, the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles decided to hold a literary and artistic competition conference on "August 15" to learn from each other and better serve production and construction with literary and artistic work.

### 创作内容密切结合生产建设　东北新文艺有新开展　文工团与文艺工作者深入工厂农村

　　创作内容密切结合生产建设
　　东北新文艺有新开展   
    文工团与文艺工作者深入工厂农村
    【新华社讯】沈阳消息：一年来东北地区的文艺工作已有新的开展。自去冬东北文学艺术工作者代表大会召开以后，大部省份都先后召开了省、市、县的文学艺术工作者代表大会，成立了地方性的文学艺术界联合会的筹备机构。若干省市虽未正式召开，但亦召集了有代表性的会议。在会上，除传达了东北文代大会的精神外，并根据当地具体情况，讨论与布置了今后的工作。在今年的春节活动中，已可看出东北文艺工作比以前大为加强。根据三个市和九十二个县的不完全的统计：参加春节活动的业余剧团共有四千三百十六个（约比去年多一倍），秧歌队有一千三百六十七个，创作戏剧、秧歌等二千三百六十七种。
    东北文艺工作的主要收获是创作内容与当前生产建设任务更密切结合。如旅大区在二月底举行的第二届工人文艺活动周中，所演出的节目都贯串了生产建设的新题材，反映了工人和农民的生产热情。其中尤以黑嘴子码头工人演出的《装卸》，最受观众欢迎。吉林、热河、辽东等省亦均配合生产建设展开文艺活动。许多文艺工作者曾在工厂和农村中，写出不少优秀的作品，对实际工作起了很大推动作用。过去某些地区领导干部存在不重视文艺工作的现象，经过文艺工作者与行政工作的配合，使文艺工作提高了群众的生产热情，增加了生产效率。行政人员与群众对文艺工作都有了新的认识。因此，业余文艺活动迅速展开。如沈阳全市的业余剧团已由去年底的一百九十三个增加到三百五十个，参加人员达一万二千七百余人；平均每月演出五百二十余次，观众约五十余万。松江省仅十五个县的统计，三个多月来即发展了五百多个剧团。辽西省全省已从去年的八百二十八个剧团增至二千三百余个。各地文联、职业文工团和业余剧团的互相结合也获有很大成绩。如上述获得观众一致好评的《装卸》一剧，即是以工人为主，经过职业文艺工作者的帮助创造而演出的。各地文联与职业文工团并组成文艺工作小组深入农村，帮助农民开展业余文艺活动。有些省、县的文联并举办训练班抽调群众文艺工作者进行学习，对开展业余文艺活动起了很大作用。松江省某些区村通过人民代表大会建立了剧团，并积极开展文艺运动；辽西省通过劳模大会的代表组织宣传，并由在群众中有威信的人负责领导，这都是很好的工作方法。各地广泛地开展了团结旧艺人与改革旧戏曲的工作。全东北共有旧艺人三千八百六十四人，现在大部分市县都成立了戏曲改进协会、曲艺研究会及影戏艺人训练班等组织，以便进一步改造他们的思想。在编写与修改剧本上，各地多已采取与旧艺人合作的方法。
            还有缺点偏向尚须努力纠正
    东北文艺工作也还存在着不少缺点与偏向，如在创作上还存在自然主义与公式主义。这是由于有些作家还用旧的观点去观察新的问题、新的人物的缘故。在提高问题上也存在不很正确的看法，不是从群众的要求和水平出发。创作题材及形式上的多样性也还不够，尤其是没有充分利用民间的文艺形式。关于改造旧艺人问题，有些地方发生了急性病的偏向，没有认识到改造工作艰巨的过程。今后东北的文艺工作将更求有计划有组织地进行。目前除继续建立和健全各省、市、县的文联组织外，文艺作家协会已有六十余个职业作家和业余作家，提出了创作计划。计划创作话剧、歌剧、小说、诗歌、脚本等八十余种。并以有经验的作家为核心，组织写作小组。东北文学艺术界联合会为广泛开展群众性的文艺活动，决定于“八·一五”举行文艺竞赛大会，以便互相观摩学习，使文艺工作更好地为生产建设服务。
