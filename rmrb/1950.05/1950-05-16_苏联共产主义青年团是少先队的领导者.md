　　The Communist Youth League of the Soviet Union is the Leader of the Young Pioneers
　　By Shapovalova

　　In the Soviet Union, a mass organization of Young Pioneers named after Lenin has been established for children. The basic task of this organization is to educate children in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and in the spirit of infinite loyalty to the socialist motherland and the Communist Party. The Young Pioneers organization helps families and schools to cultivate Soviet children into knowledgeable, hard-working, brave, and resolute citizens. From childhood, this organization teaches children a conscious attitude toward labor, a strong will to overcome difficulties, and habits of social activity.

　　The Communist Party entrusted the glorious task of educating Young Pioneers to the Lenin-Stalin Communist Youth League. The entire history of the Young Pioneer movement in the Soviet state clearly proves that the Young Pioneers maintain a very close relationship with the Communist Youth League, and that the Communist Youth League pays great attention and care to the Young Pioneers.

　　The birth date of the Young Pioneers organization is February 13, 1922. On this day, the Communist Youth League members of the 16th Printing Factory in the Red Presnya District of Moscow held the first gathering of the first Young Pioneers team in Soviet Russia. The idea of establishing an organization for children was instructed to the Communist Youth League members by Lenin as early as 1919.

　　On May 25, 1919, Lenin participated in the Youth Day held on Red Square in the capital. The young men and women gathered there reviewed their preparations to defend the young Soviet Republic from being strangled by the White Army and foreign intervention troops. Also participating in the review were a group of Moscow children who called themselves the "Young Communists Team." At that time, Lenin pointed out in his speech to the youth: "Organizing children is the best way to educate people for a communist society."

　　On January 21, 1924, a terrible sorrow spread throughout the Soviet Union—Lenin passed away. During those sorrowful days, a plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League was convened. At this session, the responsibility undertaken before the entire Party and Stalin was to cultivate outstanding successors to Lenin's cause in the Young Pioneers organization. At the same time, the Central Committee decided to name the Young Pioneers organization after Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League wrote in its message to the Young Pioneers and all children of working families: "When Lenin was alive, under his guidance and influence, the communist children's organization of Soviet Russia was born and consolidated, and will realize all his great ideas in life... You should be worthy of the great name written on your banner."

　　The great proletarian writer Gorky wrote: "The future belongs to children, this is the law of nature. The Young Pioneers are the next shift, the reserve force, the most legitimate inheritors of all that has been done and is being done. If children do not become socialists, then a socialist country cannot be built successfully."

　　Since the establishment of the Young Pioneers organization, the Communist Youth League members have always educated the Young Pioneers with the excellent qualities that characterize the Soviet people: infinite loyalty to the people, determination to overcome all difficulties, a sense of joy in life, and an unremitting desire for knowledge to better serve the people.

　　Communist Youth League members assist in organizing exemplary learning for Young Pioneers and students in general. Studying hard and abiding by discipline—this is the primary task of every Young Pioneer. The work of the Communist Youth League members among the Young Pioneers is such that children understand and recognize the great goals of the struggle for communism, encourage their ambition to occupy their due position in this struggle, and educate the Young Pioneers with the habit of collectivism.

　　The Communist Youth League's leadership of the Young Pioneers organization is actually carried out through instructors. Each instructor is responsible to the Communist Youth League, to the Communist Party, and to the people in their work. In every school, kindergarten, or Young Pioneer camp, a Young Pioneers team is established. The leader of the Young Pioneers team is the instructor. The Young Pioneers team is divided into Young Pioneers detachments, each including twenty-five to thirty Young Pioneers. In the detachment, Communist Youth League members also serve as instructors. Every Communist Youth League organization, whether in the city or in the countryside, assigns the best, most active, and politically conscious Communist Youth League members to work with children.

　　To regularly guide the activities of the Young Pioneers, a Young Pioneers headquarters is established under the District Committee, Municipal Committee, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of the affiliated republics. The Young Pioneers headquarters at all levels guides the work of all Young Pioneers organizations under its jurisdiction. They lead the work of the Young Pioneer instructors, summarize and promote their work experience.

　　The Bolshevik Party constantly reminds the Communist Youth League members that when working among the Young Pioneers, they must always remember the characteristics of children's ages, explore and find forms and methods of work that can attract and interest elementary school students, and make the work of the Young Pioneers organization a rich and interesting work.

　　Communist Youth League members are implementing this instruction and actively participating in the establishment of Young Pioneers Palaces, Children's Technology Stations, Young Natural Scientist Stations, Young Agricultural Experimenter Stations, and Travel Stations. Millions of children go there in their spare time. They learn to sing, dance, and do handicrafts there, and they develop their talents there. In these unique children's clubs, the talents of young people bloom like flowers.

　　Under the leadership of the Communist Youth League members, the Young Pioneers organize extensive mass movements, such as "studying the local area," protecting crops, planting orchards, and so on. Traveling around the local area has become particularly popular among the Young Pioneers in recent years. This kind of travel has become an excellent tradition of many Young Pioneers teams. In the past year alone, more than five million elementary school students participated in the trip. Under the leadership of older comrades—Communist Youth League members—many Young Pioneers visited the places where Lenin and Stalin lived and worked, they visited the battle areas during the Great Patriotic War, visited countless magnificent buildings in the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan, and learned about countless achievements in industry and agriculture.

　　Young Pioneers extracurricular art performances are held regularly, and these performances often turn into brilliant and happy festivals for happy Soviet children. Sports competitions and technical competitions for young physicists, chemists, and mathematicians help satisfy the diverse interests and demands of elementary school students.

　　Young Pioneers summer camps, an excellent form of children's work, have also been greatly promoted in the Soviet Union. In the past year alone, more than four million elementary school students have rested and recuperated in Young Pioneers summer camps, field study camps, and field summer health resorts.

　　The Communist Youth League and trade union organizations work together to further expand the Young Pioneers summer camp network and improve the content of its work.

　　At the same time, the Communist Youth League members also realize their leadership and influence on the Young Pioneers through children's newspapers and periodicals. Communist Youth League members in various places publish dozens of newspapers and magazines for the Young Pioneers in the languages of various nationalities of the Soviet Union. The central Young Pioneers newspaper "Young Pioneer Truth," published in Moscow alone, is published one million copies per issue. The role of the newspaper in educating Soviet children has been highly praised by Comrade Stalin. Comrade Stalin, the best teacher and friend of Soviet children, wrote in his congratulatory letter to the newspaper on the 20th anniversary of the newspaper on June 10, 1945: "'Young Pioneer Truth' helps Soviet children acquire knowledge and educates Young Pioneers and elementary school students in the spirit of the teachings of our great teacher Lenin."

　　The work of the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers in schools is closely linked. High-grade students, namely Communist Youth League members, are often models for their younger students. They hold symposiums with the Young Pioneers to discuss the Communist Youth League, the Constitution of the All-Union Lenin Communist Youth League, and the living conditions of foreign youth; they assist in holding interesting Young Pioneers gatherings, organize Young Pioneers to watch dramas and movies collectively, and so on. The Young Pioneers organization in each school has Communist Youth League members from a certain enterprise or institution to assist. The Communist Youth League members who are sent to assist lead the work of the Young Pioneers organization and give it the necessary help. They lead Young Pioneers on visits to factories and manufacturing plants, and take them to meet outstanding Stakhanov workers, Soviet heroes, and famous figures in the country. All these meetings and visits expand their horizons and help cultivate the character and morals of the Young Pioneers with the specific experiences of outstanding figures in Soviet society.

　　The Young Pioneers are the reserve force of the Communist Youth League. The Constitution of the All-Union Lenin Communist Youth League endows the Young Pioneers with the right to introduce their outstanding members to join the ranks of the Lenin-Stalin Communist Youth League. Every Young Pioneer regards joining the Communist Youth League as their highest glory.

　　The excellent qualities shown by Soviet youth in the Patriotic War: bravery, infinite and selfless love for the motherland, strong spirit, and strong character; and the characteristics shown by Soviet youth in the years of peaceful construction: love of labor, high degree of consciousness, and the spirit of never stopping until the goal is achieved—all of these, Soviet youth have developed in the years of the Young Pioneers.

　　The outstanding figures of the Soviet Union—such as Bagryashkin, who has been awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union three times, and the outstanding tractor female driver, Basha Angelina, the hero of socialist labor, were all Young Pioneers in the past. Soviet hero Danny, Smirnov, and all the participants of the "Young Guards" secret organization were all Young Pioneers before. Like millions of other Soviet citizens, they received their first social and political education in the ranks of the Young Pioneers.

　　At present, there are 13.5 million members in the Young Pioneers, aged from nine to fourteen. The Communist Youth League does not stagnate in the achievements it has already made in educating the young generation of builders of communist society. It is trying its best to expand its political and organizational influence on the Young Pioneers so that every Young Pioneer can sacredly and thoroughly realize the oath they made when they first tied the red scarf: to be always ready to fight for the cause of Lenin and Stalin.

　　苏联共产主义青年团是少先队的领导者
    莎波瓦罗娃作
    在苏联，为儿童们建立了以列宁为名的少年先锋队的群众组织。这一组织的基本任务，就是以苏维埃爱国主义的精神、对社会主义祖国及共产党的无限忠诚的精神来教育儿童。少先队组织帮助家庭及学校，来把苏联儿童培养成为有知识、爱劳动及勇敢刚毅的公民。这种组织从幼年起就教给儿童们以对于劳动的自觉态度，克服困难的坚强意志，社会活动的习惯。
    共产党把教育少先队员的光荣工作托付给了列宁——斯大林共产主义青年团。在苏维埃国家里面少先队运动的全部历史，显明地证明少先队与共青团保持着非常密切的联系，证明共青团员对于少先队员的巨大注意和关怀。
    少先队组织的诞生日，是一九二二年二月十三日。在这一天，莫斯科市红色普列斯尼区第十六号印刷所的共青团员举行了在苏俄境内第一个少先队的第一次集会。为儿童们建立组织的思想，是列宁早在一九一九年就向共青团员们指示过的。
    一九一九年五月二十五日，列宁参加了在首都红场上举行的青年节。集合到那里的男女青年们检阅了自己挺胸保卫青年苏维埃共和国免遭白党及外国干涉军队窒息的准备。参加检阅的还有一批自称为“少年共产主义者队”的莫斯科儿童。当时列宁在对青年所发表的演说中指示道：“组织儿童，这是教育共产主义社会的人的最好道路”。
    一九二四年正月二十一日那天，可怖的悲哀传遍了苏联全国——列宁与世长辞了。在当时的悲哀时日，召集了一次共青团中央全会。这次全会在全党及斯大林面前承担起的责任，是要在少先队的组织中培养起来列宁事业的优秀的继承者，同时这次中央全会，又决定少先组织以乌拉地米尔·依里奇·列宁为名。共青团中央全会在其告少先队员及劳动者家庭的全体儿童的文告上写道：“当列宁在生时，在他的指导影响下苏维埃俄国的共产主义儿童团体诞生了并巩固了，并将他所有的伟大思想实现到生活中去……你们应当成为对得起你们旗帜上所写的那个伟大的名字。”
    伟大的无产阶级作家高尔基曾写道：“未来是属于儿童的，这是自然的法则。少先队员，这是下一个工作班，这是后备队，这是已经作成的一切和正在作着的一切之最合法的继承者。若是儿童不成为社会主义者，那社会主义国家就建设不成功”。
    在有了少先队组织以来，共青团员始终是以表征苏维埃人面貌的优良品质来教育少先队员：即对于人民的无限忠诚、克服一切困难的决心、生活的愉快感、为使更好的替人民服务而生的不懈的求知欲。
    共青团员协助举办少先队员及一般学生的模范学习。用功学习和遵守纪律——这就是每个少先队员的首要任务，共青团员在少先队员中间的工作是这样的：要使儿童了解及认识为共产主义斗争的伟大目的，鼓励他们也想在这个斗争中占有自己应占的位置的宏愿，教育少先队员以集体主义的习惯。
    共青团对少先队组织的领导，实际上是通过指导员来进行的。每一指导员，在自己的工作方面，对共青团、对共产党、对人民负责。在每个学校、幼稚园或少先营内，成立少先队。在少先队内为首的是少先队长即指导员。少先队分成为包括二十五至三十名少先队员的少先分队。在分队内也是由共青团员充当指导员。无论城市或乡村的每一个共青团组织，都是分配最好的、最积极的、政治上有认识的共青团员去作儿童工作。
    为经常领导少先队的活动起见，在共青团区委、市委及加盟共和国共青团中央附属之下，设有少先队指挥部。各级少先队指挥部指导在其所属下一切少先队组织的工作。它们领导少先队指导员的工作，总结并推广他们的工作经验。
    布尔什维克党经常提起共青团员们的注意，要他们在少先队员中间进行工作时，始终不要忘记儿童年龄的特点，要他们探求并找出能吸引小学生们发生兴趣的工作形式和方法，要他们把少先队组织的工作做成内容丰富而有趣味的工作。
    共青团员们执行着这一指示，积极地参加了建立少先宫、儿童技术站、少年自然科学者站、少年农业实验者站、旅行站等工作。在闲暇的时候，有千百万儿童到那里去。他们在那里学习唱歌、跳舞、手艺，他们在那里发展自己的才能。在这些各具特色的儿童俱乐部内，少年们的才能如同鲜花一样盛开。
    少先队员们在共青团员们领导之下组织广大的群众性运动，如“研究本乡地区”、保护庄稼、种植果园及其他等等。环游本乡的旅行，近几年来在少先队员中间特别普遍。这种旅行成了许多少先队的优良传统。在去年一年里参加旅行的小学生达五百万人以上。许多少先队员在年长的同志——共青团员领导之下，到列宁和斯大林住过和工作过的各地去参观，他们到过伟大卫国战争时的战斗地区，参观了战后斯大林五年计划中无数的宏伟建筑，认识了工业和农业方面的无数成就等。
    少先队课余艺术表演会定期举行，这种表演会常变成幸福的苏维埃儿童的灿烂快乐的节日。运动比赛会及少年物理学者、化学者、数学者的技术比赛会，协助满足小学生们多方面的兴趣及要求。
    少先队夏令营，这一儿童工作的优良形式，在苏联国内也大大地推广了。只在去年一年间，到少先夏令营、野外学营及野外夏季健康所休养的，就有四百多万小学生。
    共青团与工会组织一起共同设法更进一步扩大少先队夏令营网，并改善基工作内容。
    同时共青团员，也通过儿童报刊来实现他们对于少先队员的领导和影响。各地的共青团员们用苏联各民族的语文给少先队员们出版好几十种报纸和杂志。仅仅莫斯科出版的少先队中央报纸《少先队真理报》，每期便发行一百万份。该报在教育苏联儿童方面所起的作用，得到了斯大林同志的甚高的评价。苏联儿童的最好导师及朋友斯大林同志，在一九四五年六月十日该报二十周年纪念日致该报的贺信上写道：“《少先队真理报》帮助苏联儿童们摄取知识，并以我们伟大导师列宁的教训之精神来教育少先队员和一般小学生。”
    在学校里共青团和少先队的工作是彼此密切联系进行的。高年级的同学即共青团员们，每常是他们的小同学们效法的模范。他们与少先队员举行座谈会，讨论共青团、全苏列宁共产主义青年团团章、以及外国青年的生活情况；他们协助举办有兴趣的少先队员集会，组织少先队员集体观剧、集体看电影等等。每个学校内的少先队组织，有某一企业或机关的共青团员们来协助。被派作协助者的共青团员，领导少先队组织的工作并给它以必要的帮助。他们带领少先队员参观团到工厂及制造场去参观，带他们去与优秀的斯达哈诺夫工作者、苏联英雄、国内著名人物会面。所有这一切会见及参观等，都使他们的眼界扩大，并以苏维埃社会的优秀人物的具体经历，来帮助教养少先队员的性格及道德。
    少先队员是共青团的后备队。全苏列宁共产主义青年团团章，赋与少先队以介绍自己优秀团员加入列宁——斯大林共青团队伍的权利。每一个少先队员都以加入共青团为自己最高的光荣。
    苏联青年在卫国战争中所表现的那些优良品质：勇敢、对祖国的无限与忘我的热爱、坚强的精神及坚强的性格；以及苏联青年在和平建设岁月里所表现的那些特征：爱好劳动、高度的自觉性及不达目的不止的精神——所有这一切，苏联青年在少先队的年岁中就已养成了。
    苏联的优秀人物——如三次荣获苏联英雄称号的包格雷什金和杰出的拖拉机女驾驶员社会主义劳动英雄芭莎、安格林娜，过去都是少先队员。苏联英雄丹娘、斯米尔诺夫、“青年近卫军”秘密组织的全体参加者，从前都曾是少先队员。他们大家也如千百万其他苏联公民一样，是在少先队的队伍里受到初次社会教育和政治教育的。
    现时少先队内从九岁至十四岁的队员，计达一千三百五十万人。共青团并不停滞在教育共产主义社会建设者青年一代所已达到的成绩。它正尽量扩大自己对少先队员的政治影响和组织影响，以便使每个少先队员在初次系上红领带时所作的宣誓：时常准备着为列宁——斯大林事业而斗争，能够神圣而彻底地实现。
