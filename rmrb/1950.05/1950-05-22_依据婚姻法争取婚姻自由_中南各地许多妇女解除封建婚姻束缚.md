Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 17th: Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, the people in various parts of the Central and Southern region, especially women, are actively applying to the People's Government for free marriage and the lifting of unreasonable feudal marriage shackles, based on the principles of freedom of marriage for men and women, monogamy, and equal rights for men and women in the new Marriage Law. The Wuhan Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau has also begun to handle the registration of marriage, divorce, and voluntary resumption of marriage between men and women after divorce, in accordance with the Marriage Law. At the same time, since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, there has been a significant increase in the number of marriage dispute cases accepted by the people's courts. The Wuhan Municipal People's Court accepted a total of 110 marriage cases in nearly 22 days, which is double the number in November last year; the Changsha Municipal People's Court accepted 15 marriage cases in March, which increased to 37 after the promulgation of the Marriage Law in April. About half of these cases involve requests for divorce, most of which are due to the woman's opposition to domestic abuse, the man's bigamy, or the incompatibility of feelings between the two parties.

According to statistics from the people's courts of various provinces and cities in the Central and Southern region, marriage cases accepted since liberation account for more than 26 percent of all civil cases, and the vast majority are filed by women oppressed by feudal marriages. However, since many places have been liberated not long ago, many people are deeply influenced by the remnants of feudal society, and even some cadres have feudal ideas of "valuing men over women" and suppressing freedom of marriage. As a result, the phenomenon of women being forced to commit suicide due to lack of freedom of marriage and abuse of women is still very serious in the vast rural and urban areas. According to incomplete statistics from 16 counties in Henan and the two cities of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, from August last year to March this year, 77 women were struggled against, detained, and beaten for demanding divorce, resulting in forced suicide. Another 45 women were killed by their husbands or mothers-in-law for being dissatisfied with old-fashioned marriages. Since the promulgation and implementation of the Marriage Law, these phenomena have begun to be corrected. Many husbands or mothers-in-law who oppressed their daughters-in-law have been sentenced to deserved punishment after being reported to the government by the local people. For example, in April, an incident of strangling a wife occurred in Lingbao County, Henan, which immediately aroused the public outrage of all women in the county. The county women's federation filed a public prosecution with the people's court, and the murderer Zhao Suozhi was sentenced to death.

At present, the people's governments and people's organizations of various provinces and cities in the Central and Southern region are actively organizing cadres to study the new Marriage Law and widely publicizing it to the masses to ensure the implementation of the Marriage Law.

### 依据婚姻法争取婚姻自由  中南各地许多妇女解除封建婚姻束缚

　　依据婚姻法争取婚姻自由
    中南各地许多妇女解除封建婚姻束缚
    【新华社汉口十七日电】中华人民共和国婚姻法公布后，中南区各地人民群众特别是妇女群众正纷纷依据新婚姻法中男女婚姻自由、一夫一妻、男女权利平等等原则，向人民政府申请自由结婚和解除不合理的封建婚姻的束缚。武汉市人民政府民政局亦已根据婚姻法，开始办理结婚、离婚及离婚后男女双方自愿恢复结婚的登记工作。同时，自婚姻法公布后，人民法院方面受理的婚姻纠纷案件已有显著的增加。武汉市人民法院近二十二天内共受理婚姻案一百一十件，较去年十一月份增加一倍；长沙市人民法院三月份受理婚姻案十五件，四月份婚姻法公布后增至三十七件。这些案件中要求离婚的约占半数，其中大多为女方反对家庭虐待、男方重婚或双方感情不合等。
    据中南区各省、市人民法院统计：解放以来所受理的婚姻案件占全部民事案的百分之二十六强，而且绝大多数是受封建婚姻压迫的女方提出来的。但由于各地解放不久，很多群众受封建社会的遗毒很深，甚至在部分干部中也有着“重男轻女”、压抑婚姻自由的封建思想，因而在广大农村和城镇中由于婚姻不自由和虐待妇女，以致酿成妇女被迫自杀的现象仍很严重。据河南十六个县和郑州、开封两市的不完全统计，从去年八月到今年三月，有七十七个妇女因要求离婚反而遭受开会斗争、扣押、吊打，结果被迫自杀。还有四十五个妇女因不满旧式婚姻而被丈夫或婆母杀害。自婚姻法颁布实施后，这些现象已经开始得到纠正。不少压迫媳妇的丈夫或婆母，经当地人民向政府控告后被判处应得之罪。如河南灵宝县在四月曾发生一件勒杀妻子的事件，立即引起该县全体妇女的公愤，由县妇联会向人民法庭提起公诉，结果凶犯赵锁治被判处死刑。
    目前，中南区各省、市人民政府和人民团体正积极组织干部学习新婚姻法，并向群众广泛宣传，以保证婚姻法的贯彻执行。
