Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 27th: TASS reports from New York: The Worker's Daily reports that the Communist Party National Committee meeting from the 22nd to the 23rd placed its main emphasis on the need to strengthen the struggle for peace. Communist Party Secretary Hall gave a report emphasizing the urgency of accelerating and expanding the peace struggle in the United States.

Hall declared: Currently, within the United States, the people's sentiment demanding peace is strong, but it has not been fully organized to prevent the movement towards war. He pointed out that peace movements must be organized among all strata of the American people, especially among workers.

Hall continued: Workers in other countries are worried because of the lack of large-scale and effective peace actions in the United States, and because the shipment of weapons to Western Europe has not aroused protest. Therefore, it is necessary to organize workshop and neighborhood peace committees nationwide to carry out the struggle for peace.

Hall emphasized that the peace movement would lack solidity and stability without the working class as a solid foundation. An effective peace movement must include workers, blacks, women, youth, farmers, intellectuals, and other masses. In the battle for peace, Communists must emphasize the development of mass movements among the working masses, and must assist all other efforts made for the purpose of peace. Hall emphasized the special responsibility of the American Communist Party as the vanguard representing the American working class, and that the United States is the largest imperialist country, the source of war danger threatening all peoples.

After Hall's report, the National Committee unanimously adopted his proposal to intensify the struggle for peace. The National Committee meeting also discussed the need to intensify the opposition to fascist tendencies in the United States, defend Communist leaders and release party General Secretary Dennis, abolish the infamous House Un-American Activities Committee, and fight for black rights.

　　美共全国委员会开会
    通过加紧和平斗争议案
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：工人日报报道：二十二日至二十三日的共产党全国委员会会议，把主要的着重点放在加强和平斗争的需要上。共产党书记霍尔曾作报告，强调指出在美国加速和扩大和平斗争的迫切性。
    霍尔宣称：目前，在美国国内，人民要求和平的情绪是强烈的，但是，还没有充分地组织起来，以阻止走向战争的运动。他指出：必须在美国人民的一切阶层中，尤其是在工人中间，组织和平运动。
    霍尔继称：其他国家的工人们是有忧虑的，因为在美国缺乏大规模的有效的和平行动，并且因为武器运往西欧时也没有引起抗议。因此，必须在全国组织车间与街邻和平委员会，以便开展和平斗争。
    霍尔着重指出：和平运动如果没有工人阶级做稳固的基础，就会缺乏坚实性与稳固性。有效的和平运动必须包括工人、黑人、妇女、青年、农民、知识分子及其他群众。共产党人在为和平的战斗中，必须强调发展劳动群众中间的群众运动，同时必须协助其他以和平为目的而作的一切努力。霍尔强调美国共产党作为代表美国工人阶级的先锋队的特殊责任，而美国乃是威胁所有各国人民的战争危险出发地的最大帝国主义国家。
    在霍尔报告之后，全国委员会一致通过了他的加紧和平斗争的建议。全国委员会会议也讨论了必须加紧反对美国国内法西斯的倾向，保卫共产党领袖和释放党的总书记但尼斯，撤销恶名昭彰的众院非美活动委员会，以及争取黑人权利的斗争。
