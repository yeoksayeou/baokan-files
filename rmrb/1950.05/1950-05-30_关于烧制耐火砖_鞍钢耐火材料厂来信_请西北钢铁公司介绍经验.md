About Firing Refractory Bricks
    Letter from Anshan Iron and Steel Refractory Materials Plant
    Requesting Northwest Steel Company to Introduce Experience

To the responsible comrades of Northwest Steel Company,

We have seen the report on the second page of the May 20th People's Daily that your factory has created a new record of a breakage rate of only 0.3% in the process of firing sand bricks. Based on our factory's actual operating experience, a breakage rate of 0.3% is very difficult to achieve in the sand brick firing process. Your factory's brilliant achievement is worthy of our congratulations and worthy of our learning. To this end, we would like to raise the following questions, and we ask the responsible comrades of your factory to provide specific answers in order to help us improve our work:

    I. What are the raw materials, finished products, physical inspection, chemical analysis, and qualified finished product specifications for your factory's sand brick firing?

    II. What is the kiln capacity, loading method, number of firing days, and number of cooling days for your factory's kilns?

    III. What are the kiln control equipment, the kiln temperature rise and fall curve, and the method for measuring this curve?

    IV. What are the specifications of all the bricks in the firing process that achieves a 0.3% breakage rate?

    V. Is the 0.3% scrap rate for kiln firing a record for one kiln, or is it an average over several months?

    VI. What is your factory's detailed batching method (including sieve analysis, moisture content, and the name and dosage of binders and fluxes)?

　　关于烧制耐火砖
    鞍钢耐火材料厂来信
    请西北钢铁公司介绍经验编辑同志请转西北钢铁公司负责同志：
    我们已看到五月二十日人民日报第二版登载的你厂创造了砂砖烧制过程中破损率仅达千分之三的新纪录。根据我厂实际作业的经验，千分之三损坏率的纪录是砂砖烧制过程中很难达到的。你厂这样光辉的成就，是值得我们祝贺、值得我们学习的。为此，我们提出下列问题，请你厂负责同志作具体解答，以便帮助我们把工作提高一步：
    一、你厂烧制砂砖的原料、成品、物理检验、化学分析及合格成品规格等如何？
    二、你厂的窑容量、装窑方法、烧窑日数及冷窑日数如何？
    三、烧窑控制设备，窑温上升下降曲线及此种曲线之测定法如何？
    四、千分之三损坏率的烧成过程中所有砖之规格如何？
    五、烧窑废品达到千分之三，是否系一窑的纪录？抑系数月之平均数？
    六、你厂详细配料方法（包括筛分析水分、粘合剂助熔剂之名称及用量）如何？
