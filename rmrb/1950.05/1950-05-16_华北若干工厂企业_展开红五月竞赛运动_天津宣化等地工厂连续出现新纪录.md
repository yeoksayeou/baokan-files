　　Several Factories and Enterprises in North China
　　Launch "Red May" Competition Movement
　　New Records Continuously Appear in Factories in Tianjin, Xuanhua, and Other Places
　　[Report from Our Newspaper] Factories and enterprises in several regions of North China are currently engaged in a heated "Red May" production competition. This movement fully demonstrates the high political consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the working class.
　　The Tianjin Steel Plant, Automobile Assembly Plant, Machine Factory, Bicycle Factory, Rubber Factory, and the Industrial Division of the Telecommunications Bureau, including the First and Second Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Factories, successively launched production competitions starting on May 2nd. The majority of employees are involved in the competition fervor and have already begun to create new records for increased production. On May 2nd, workers in the steelmaking department of the steel plant immediately began dismantling and repairing the Martin furnace as soon as the furnace fire went out. They are striving to complete the month's production competition plan within the twelve days of actual steelmaking. The quality of rebar produced by the plant's rolling mill has improved compared to the past, with first-class products reaching 90 percent, and rejects decreasing from about 4 percent before the competition to about 1.5 percent. During the competition, employees of the First Electrical Equipment Factory formulated production competition plans for groups and individuals. Motor mechanic Han Zhiliang and others improved the method of winding high-voltage coils, increasing production efficiency by one and a half times. Employees of the Bicycle Factory and the Automobile Assembly Plant are also concentrating their efforts on improving product quality.
　　Workers at the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau Power Plant launched a 100-day safety operation competition. The boiler section took the lead in challenging other groups, followed by the turbine section and the electrical section. Units such as the civil engineering section, coal hauling section, power supply section, and business section all responded enthusiastically. To ensure the completion of the competition plan, various sections and groups are brewing the establishment of linkage contracts and are preparing to sign collective contracts with the administration. The plant's competition officially began on the 15th of this month.
　　Since the launch of the "May Day" production competition, state-owned mines and factories in Xuanhua City have continuously set new production records. Wang Lizhong, a machinist at the Longyan Machine Factory, used to turn out sixty-five mine car rolling keys per day. Since the start of the competition, he increased this to eighty-five on April 16th, and soon further increased it to ninety-one. Zhang Bingxin, a fitter, used to thread two hundred and fifty fishplate bolts per day, but has now increased this to nine hundred and forty. The daily paper production volume of the paper mill has increased from 170 reams to 255 reams, with improved quality and a decrease of approximately 10 percent in rejects compared to March. The Xiahuayuan Power Plant completed the overhaul of boiler number four ahead of schedule, saving 146 workdays. In the past, the state-owned distillery needed two catties and fourteen taels of sorghum to distill one catty of liquor, but this has now been reduced to two catties and seven taels, and the amount of yeast used has also decreased from nine taels per catty to seven taels and three taels, significantly reducing costs.
　　With the goal of achieving safety, accuracy, speed, and economy in transportation, the Tianjin Railway Bureau launched a railway-wide record-breaking movement on "May Day". To welcome "Red May," employees of various locomotive depots within the jurisdiction of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau have successively launched production competitions. The Yuncheng Locomotive Depot launched the "Four-Three-Three-Four" movement (namely, four no's, three savings, three cleans, and four thoroughness). Taking the contracted crew group as an example, the goal is to eliminate major accidents, reduce minor accidents, and strive for a safe run of 37,000 kilometers. The guarantee conditions are: "Four No's" - no missed rides, no rushing, no recklessness, no delays; "Three Savings" - saving oil, saving fuel, saving energy; "Three Cleans" - clean hands, clean locomotives, clean elimination of accidents; "Four Thoroughness" - thorough calling and responding, thorough fueling, thorough signal confirmation, thorough compliance with rules and regulations.

　　华北若干工厂企业
　　展开红五月竞赛运动           
　　天津宣化等地工厂连续出现新纪录
    【本报讯】华北若干地区的工厂企业，正开展热烈的红五月生产竞赛运动。在这一运动中，充分地显示了工人阶级的高度政治觉悟和劳动热情。
    天津市制钢厂，汽车制配厂，机器厂，自行车厂，橡胶厂及电讯总局工业处所属电工器材第一、第二制造厂，从五月二日起，先后展开生产竞赛运动。大多数职工均卷入竞赛热潮，并已开始创造出提高生产的新纪录。五月二日，制钢厂炼钢部职工在炉火刚熄时，立即动手拆修马丁炉。争取在实际炼钢的十二天中，完成本月份的生产竞赛计划。该厂轧钢厂所产盘条的质量已较前提高，一级产品达到百分之九十，废品则由竞赛前的百分之四降到百分之一点五左右。电工一厂职工在竞赛过程中，订出小组和个人的生产竞赛计划。电机工韩志良等改进绕高压线圈的方法，生产效率提高一倍半。自行车厂和汽车配制厂职工，也以最大的力量，集中改进产品质量。
    唐山电业局发电厂职工发动了百日安全运行大竞赛。锅炉股首先向各组挑战，汽机股、电气股相继应战。土木股、抬煤股、供电科、营业科等单位均纷纷响应。为保证竞赛计划的完成，各科股间，正在酝酿订立联系合同，并准备与行政上订立集体合同。该厂竞赛运动已于本月十五日正式开始。
    宣化市各国营矿厂自开展“五一”生产竞赛运动以来，连续创出生产新纪录。龙烟机器厂机工王立中，过去每天旋矿车滚键六五个，自开展竞赛后，四月十六号增到八五个，很快又增到九十一个。钳工张秉信套鱼尾螺丝，过去每天作二百五十个，现已增至九百四十个。造纸厂每日产纸量已由一七○令增至二五五令，质量较前提高，废品则较三月份减少百分之十左右。下花园发电厂，提前完成了检修四号锅炉的任务，省工一四六个。国营酒厂过去烧一斤酒，须用二斤十四两红粮，现已减到二斤七两，曲子也由每斤九两减到七两三，成本大为降低。
    天津铁路局以达到运输上的安全、正确、迅速、经济为目标，于“五一”开展全路创新纪录运动。太原铁路局管内各机务段职工，为迎接红五月，相继开展生产竞赛。运城机务段展开“四三三四”运动，（即四不、三省、三干净、四彻底）。以包乘组为例，奋斗目标是消灭大事故、减少小事故、争取安全走行三七、○○○公里。保证条件是：“四不”不漏乘，不抢点，不冒进，不晚点；“三省”省油脂，省燃料，省精力；“三干净”干活手底下干净，机车清扫的干净，事故消灭的干净；“四彻底”呼唤应答彻底，给油工作彻底，信号确认彻底，遵守规章纪律彻底。
