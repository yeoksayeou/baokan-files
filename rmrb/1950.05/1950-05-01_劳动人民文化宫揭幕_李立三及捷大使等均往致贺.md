　　Labor People's Cultural Palace Opens; Li Lisan and Czech Ambassador Attend to Congratulate
    [Our Newspaper] The "Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace," which the capital's working people have long yearned for, officially opened yesterday (April 30th). At 8:00 AM, the Cultural Palace opened, and Beijing's working people, with the joy of being masters of their own house, victoriously stepped into their own cultural palace. Above the palace gate hung the plaque inscribed by Chairman Mao himself: "Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace." Inside the palace, ancient cypresses were verdant, and peonies were in bloom. On both sides of the main hall, gigantic portraits of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin were hung on the palace walls. The palace was adorned with red slogans, and the halls displayed valuable gifts from various agencies, organizations, and trade unions, as well as inscriptions and brocade banners from responsible comrades. The opening ceremony was held at 11:00 AM under the ancient pines on the right side of the palace. Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and other responsible persons, as well as foreign guests such as Czech Ambassador Dr. Weiskopf, attended the meeting. At the meeting, Xiao Ming, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, first reported on the preparation process. He said: The preparation for the Cultural Palace took less than two months, a short period, and the facilities are insufficient. The current achievements are entirely due to the instructions and assistance from various leading bodies, as well as the active participation of the city's workers in construction. However, it can also be said that the preparation time for the Cultural Palace has been very long and the achievements are very good, because the Temple of Emperors has been created by the blood and sweat of our workers themselves, and it has a history of hundreds of years. However, it has always been occupied by reactionary rulers. It was not until the liberation of Beijing and the victory of the revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao that it returned to the embrace of the working people. We should cherish and utilize it well, so that it truly becomes a cultural paradise for the working people. Then, Comrade Li Lisan delivered a speech. He first congratulated the working people of Beijing for having their own cultural palace. He pointed out that this is the great fruit of the people's revolution. This shows that our working class has truly turned over. In the past, labor was despised, the working people were exploited and oppressed, and the culture created by the working people was plundered by the reactionary ruling class and exclusively enjoyed and occupied by them. Just as the Temple of Emperors was originally built by the working people, and once it was built, the working people could not enter it at all. Today, the people's revolution has been victorious, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the working people have reversed thousands of years of history. Now we can transform the culture that originally served the exploiting class into a culture for the working people to enjoy, and we must also develop and improve the culture of the working people. We must create the most outstanding and highest level of culture of mankind in the era of our working people. Beijing used to be called a cultural city, but in the past it was a feudal cultural city. Now, with the joint efforts of the working people of the whole city, we must build our workers' cultural city, our working people's cultural city, a new democratic cultural city, and a socialist cultural city. The workers and all the working people of Beijing must build labor well and make it a model that can truly represent the culture of the working people and become the culture of the capital. At that time, our working people's cultural and happy life will be greatly improved. Long live the Labor Cultural Palace! Subsequently, Liao Mosha, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Weng Dujian, Director of the Municipal Government's Bureau of Culture and Education, Li Bozhao, Deputy Director, and Guo Renzhi, Zhou Weizhi, and others spoke in succession. Czech Ambassador Dr. Weiskopf was also invited to deliver a speech. Labor Zhi Shen from the Telecommunications Bureau and Wang Jiaxi from the Trolleybus Company also spoke excitedly. After the meeting, entertainment began, with the Central Academy of Drama performing war drums, waist drums, children's plays, and the "Building the Motherland" Yangko dance to add to the fun. Basketball and table tennis matches were also held. The mass hall, cultural hall, dance room, drama room, art room, and exhibitions of workers' movement, women's movement, the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, Soviet introduction photos, and workers' art works were displayed. It is estimated that today about 10,000 workers, students, cadres, women, and citizens visited and toured the palace.

　　劳动人民文化宫揭幕  李立三及捷大使等均往致贺
    【本报讯】为首都劳动人民一致渴望的“北京市劳动人民文化宫”昨（四月三十日）天正式开幕了。晨八时，文化宫开放，北京市的劳动人民怀着主人翁的欢欣心情，胜利迈进自己的文化宫。宫门高悬毛主席亲笔题写的“北京市劳动人民文化宫”的匾额。宫内古柏苍翠，牡丹开放，正殿外两侧宫墙悬挂毛主席、斯大林大元帅巨幅画像。宫殿环饰红色的标语，殿内陈设各机关团体工会的珍贵赠品及各负责同志题字和锦幛。揭幕式于十一时在宫内右侧古松下举行。全总李立三副主席等负责人，及外宾捷克大使魏斯柯普夫博士等均莅会参加。会上首由市总工会副主席萧明报告筹备经过。他说：文化宫筹备不到二月，时间短促，设备不足。现有的成绩全赖各领导方面的指示帮助，以及全市职工的积极参加建设。但也可以说，文化宫的筹建时间很长，成绩很好，因太庙本是我们工人自己血汗创建起来的，而且已有几百年的历史了。但它一直为反动统治者所霸占，直到北京解放，在中国共产党及毛主席领导下，革命胜利了，才重归劳动人民的怀抱。我们应很好的爱护与利用它，使它真正成为劳动人民的文化乐园。继由李立三同志演讲：他首先庆贺北京市劳动人民有了自己的文化宫，他指出这是人民革命胜利的伟大果实，这说明我们工人阶级是真正的翻身了，过去劳动是被轻视的，劳动人民是被剥削被压迫的，劳动人民创造起来的文化却被反动统治阶级剥夺了，专为他们所享受所霸占，正如太庙原为劳动人民修建起来的，一修好后劳动人民根本就不能进来了。今天人民革命胜利了，在毛主席的领导下劳动人民就将几千年的历史扭转了过来。现在我们已能把原来专为剥削阶级服务的文化变为劳动人民自己享受的文化，而且还要把劳动人民的文化发展起来，提高起来，要在我们劳动人民的时代创造出人类最优秀最高度的文化来。北京以前就叫做文化城，但过去是封建的文化城，现在要在我们全市劳动人民脑手并用共同努力之下建造起我们工人的文化城，我们劳动人民的文化城，新民主主义的文化城，社会主义的文化城，北京市的工人和全体劳动人民要把劳动好好的建设起来使它成为能真正代表劳动人民文化，而成为首都文化的模范，那时，我们劳动人民的文化幸福生活就会大大提高了，劳动文化宫万岁！接着由中共北京市委宣传部副部长廖沫沙、政府文教局局长翁独健、副局长李伯钊及郭任之，周魏峙等相继讲话，捷克大使魏斯柯普夫博士，亦被邀发表演说，电信局工友劳志慎、电车公司工友王家玺也兴奋发言。大会结束，游艺开始，由中央戏剧学院演出战鼓，腰鼓、童戏及建设祖国大秧歌助兴，并展开篮球及乒乓球赛、群众厅、文化厅、舞蹈室、戏剧室、美术室、陈列工人运动、妇女运动、抗日战争，解放战争，苏联介绍照片及工人美术作品展览。总计今日工人、学生、机关干部、妇女、市民等游览参观者约一万余人。
