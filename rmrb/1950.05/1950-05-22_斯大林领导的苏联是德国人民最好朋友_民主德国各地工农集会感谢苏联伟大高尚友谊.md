　　Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: The Soviet government's decision to reduce Germany's remaining reparations obligations by 50% has aroused universal joy and deep gratitude among people from all walks of life in the German Democratic Republic. According to a TASS dispatch: After learning of the above decision, enterprises in various parts of the Republic and Berlin spontaneously held meetings. At the meetings, workers, staff, and intellectuals solemnly pledged to fight for the establishment of a unified, peace-loving Germany and to complete the national economic plan ahead of schedule, so as to further strengthen friendship with the great Soviet Union.

　　The Political Bureau of the German Socialist Unity Party sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), expressing gratitude. The telegram pointed out that this decision is new evidence of the Soviet people's selfless and noble friendship towards the German people, and it is of great help to the struggle for the restoration of Germany's unity on a democratic basis and the establishment of Germany's peaceful economy. The telegram pointed out: Widows and orphans left behind by the Great Patriotic War still remind the Soviet people of the terrible atrocities of Hitlerite fascism.

　　Special resolutions of the Federation of Free German Trade Unions Council and resolutions passed by the General Secretariat of the German-Soviet Friendship Association pointed out that today, except for the liars and agents of the warmongers, no honest German would doubt that the Stalin-led Soviet Union is the best friend of the German people.

Employees of the Berlin gas plant, personnel of the Berlin "Kali-Chemie" People's Enterprise, and 60,000 workers of the Rostock Neptune Shipyard expressed warm welcome to the Soviet government's decision and pledged to strive to restore a peaceful economy and consolidate the world peace front.
