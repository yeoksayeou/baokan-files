The Irresistible Power of Peace
A Record of the People's Daily Peace Signature Drive, Day Three

All those who signed the appeal expressed their enthusiasm for peace and their determination to defend it. The soldiers of the Third Bureau of the Military Commission said, "If these demons dare to launch a criminal war of aggression, we will fight resolutely until these war instigators are completely eliminated!"

Three People's Liberation Army soldiers, after happily signing their names, said: "The People's Liberation Army should take the lead in signing in support of world peace."

Peace is even more precious to those who have been wounded in war, but this does not mean that we should oppose all wars. Du Jinsheng, a revolutionary soldier who was honorably wounded, wrote in the comments book: I am willing to dedicate my incomplete body, left over from the war, to the war against aggression and for peace.

The power of peace-loving people expressed in the peace appeal is irresistible! Employees of the Tianjin Daming Company said, "For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we cannot let them be cannon fodder..." Employees of the China Department Store Sale Department expressed the hope of mankind: "We want atomic energy to be used for peaceful construction..." Citizens Wang Shaoqiao and his wife said, "For the happiness and peace of mankind, we are willing to contribute our humble efforts..." Give one point of heat, emit one point of light!

An old乡(xiang1 - fellow villager) who had just signed his name said to another old乡(xiang1 - fellow villager) who was walking towards the signing place: "Sign quickly! One name is one gun against U.S. imperialism!" The simple people have already realized that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of peace.

More than 20 fifth-grade children from the Central Primary School in District One automatically lined up to sign their names at our newspaper's signing location after class, and each of them also asked us for a copy of the peace appeal to mobilize their relatives and friends to sign it. The children not only know why to defend world peace, but also know how to work to defend world peace.

Chen Zhongnian's family of eleven, from No. 8 Zhongqian Zhang Hutong, Xicheng, all participated in the signing. His child, Chen Zhangbi, wrote on the signature form: I want my father, mother, older brother, older sister, younger brother, but I don't want war! I hope for permanent peace!

The Beijing Struggle Primary School wrote in a letter to our newspaper: "The imperialists want to use atomic weapons to destroy the world. All 200 of our students were very angry when they heard this. We want to use our signatures to tell the imperialists: we want peace. Whoever uses atomic weapons to harm people is a war criminal!"

Comrade Li Zhong, a cadre of the Civil Aviation Administration, and his wife signed their names, and also signed the name of their three-month-old baby, Li Duoduo, and wrote: "A three-month-old baby doesn't understand anything yet, but if he did, he would definitely agree with peace, so we, as parents, signed his name for him."

Yesterday, all four reading groups of our newspaper participated in the peace signature campaign. Wang Yuanhua, a reader of our newspaper, mobilized 32 people to sign.

　　记本报和平签名第三日
    一切在呼吁书上签名的人，都表示出他们拥护和平的热诚与保卫和平的决心。军委三局的战士们说：“如果这批恶魔敢于发动罪恶的侵略战争，我们将作坚决的战斗，直到这批战争挑拨者被彻底消灭为止！”

    和平，对于曾经在战争中受过伤的人，是更为珍贵的，但这并不是说我们应该反对一切战争。一位曾经光荣挂彩的革命军人杜金生，在意见簿上写道：我愿把在战争中遗留下来的残缺不全的身体，贡献给反对侵略、争取和平的战争。

    一位刚签完名的老乡，对另一位正走向签名处的老乡说：“快签吧！一个名字就是对美帝国主义的一枝枪！”朴质的人民，已经认识到美帝国主义是和平的死敌了。

    一区中心小学五年级的廿多位小朋友们，下课后自动地排着队来本报签名处签名，并且每人还向我们要一张和平呼吁书去发动他们的亲友在上面签名。孩子们不但知道为什么保卫世界和平，而且也知道怎样为保卫世界和平而工作。

    民航局干部李忠同志和他的爱人签了名后，还为他们的三个月的婴儿李多多签上了名，而且写道：“三个月的婴儿，还不懂事，假如他懂事，他一定赞成和平，所以我们做父母的就替他签了名。”
