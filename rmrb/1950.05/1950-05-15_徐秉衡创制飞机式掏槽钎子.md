Xu Bingheng Creates Airplane-Style Slotting Drill Bit
Wang Daoyi　Sun Keqin
There is no one in the Hegang Coal Mine who doesn’t know Xu Bingheng, especially the young workers, who all say with admiration when they mention him, “He’s great! Worthy of our study.”

He started as an apprentice in a factory at the age of fourteen and has been there for ten years now. He is now a lathe operator in the Mechanical and Electrical Factory of the Hegang Nanshan Coal Mine. He was awarded two major merits in the Red May production competition in 1949, and in the October production merit campaign, he was awarded two major merits and two minor merits. He joined the Communist Youth League last September, and in January of this year, at the first Communist Youth League Congress in the mining area, he was elected as a model League member and became the secretary of the Mechanical and Electrical Factory branch of the Communist Youth League Committee. He is extremely active in production!

After Li Qingxuan created the medicine pot-style slotting drill bit, workers throughout the mine proposed to learn from Li Qingxuan. Worker Li Jingrong said to Xu Bingheng, "Old Xu, did you see that? Li Qingxuan was reported in the newspaper, what an honor! We have to use our brains too." Old Xu was anxious. He thought, "Li Qingxuan's brain works well. I've also been in the factory for more than ten years, and I'm a member of the Communist Youth League, so how can I fall behind others!"

When testing the medicine pot-style drill bit created by Li Qingxuan, the workers felt that "This drill bit is sometimes not easy to use when drilling holes, and it is prone to 'blast through,' only collapsing one blast hole and not blasting out coal." This shortcoming has become an obstacle in the promotion. The higher-ups called on everyone to find ways to research and improve it. Xu Bingheng responded to the call, and according to the structure of the medicine pot-style drill bit, he drew a blueprint and studied it at home every day after work, sometimes even forgetting to eat. For more than ten days in a row, he couldn't find a solution, but his confidence was still great, believing that "Nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it." As long as you study hard, you will definitely find a way. One day, he was looking for materials in the scrap iron pile and found a broken iron drill. This gave him an inspiration: "To make a drill bit with two-sided blades like an iron drill, drilling holes will definitely maintain the center, and drilling holes will be precise, and there will be no 'blast through' when blasting." Thinking like this, he repeatedly researched and experimented, and finally succeeded in creating it. The workers all liked this new drill bit very much. It is easy to use, drills holes quickly, the spun medicine pot is precise, the resistance is balanced, there is no "blast through", and the explosive force is also great, advancing 2.5 meters (the highest record in the mine), and one blast can blast seventeen or eight carts of coal (the highest record). The workers saw that this drill bit looked very much like an airplane wing, so they gave it a very beautiful name, called the "Airplane-Style Slotting Drill Bit."

Soon after the airplane-style drill bit was created, the Provincial Working Committee of the Communist Youth League wrote a congratulatory letter to Xu Bingheng, encouraging him to say: "...This is the glory of the Chinese working class, the glory of the League. I hope you maintain this glory, exert greater strength, and continue to create more new records...." Old Xu was overjoyed when he received this letter! He especially kept the words "maintain glory, continue to create" firmly in his mind. The factory administration awarded a banner and called on everyone to learn from Xu Bingheng's creative spirit.

The idea of winning the red flag was hanging in Old Xu's mind again. This time, he didn't just work on his own with his head buried in the sand. Instead, he often studied with everyone in the technical study class. After hard work, he created the "Coal Powder Scooper" for the use of the airplane-style drill bit; improved the wrench frame used for spinning screws, and jointly researched and created the "Powder Delivery Device" with staff member Tian Xiangrong. Due to his influence and help, League member Li Jingrong also created the "Drill Bit for Drilling Rocks"; League member Wang Zhongying improved the "Transformer"; League member Zhang Renjin improved the "Spearhead Tooth Wheel."

A "Creativity" banner was finally inserted on Xu Bingheng's lathe. The model group banner was also won by their group. When people praised Xu Bingheng, he always said modestly, "It's nothing. Without Comrade Li Qingxuan's creation of the 'Medicine Pot-Style Drill Bit,' how could I have created the 'Airplane-Style Drill Bit'? Without the cultivation of the Party and the League, and without everyone's help, I wouldn't be able to create anything."

　　徐秉衡创制飞机式掏槽钎子
　　王道义　孙克勤
    徐秉衡在鹤岗煤矿是没有一个不知的，特别是青年工友们一提起他来，都羡慕的说：“好样的！值得咱们学习。”
    他从十四岁就到工厂当学徒，到现在已十年了。现在是鹤岗南山煤矿机电工厂的旋盘工，他在一九四九年红五月生产竞赛中曾立过两次大功，十月生产立功运动中又立了两次大功两次小功。去年九月入团，今年一月矿区开第一次团代大会，被选为模范团员，又当上了团矿区执行委员、机电厂支部书记。生产可积极啦！
    李庆萱创造药壶式掏槽钎子后，全矿工友纷纷提出要向李庆萱看齐。工友李景荣对徐秉衡说：“老徐看见了吗？李庆萱上报啦，多么光荣呵！咱们脑瓜也得好好动一动。”老徐心里着了急。他想：“李庆萱脑瓜好使，我也住了十多年工厂，又是青年团员，那能落在别人后边呢！”
    在试验李庆萱创造的药壶业式钎子时，工友们觉得：“这钎子打眼有时不好使，放炮爱打筒，只崩一个炮窝，崩不出煤来。”这缺点已成为推广中的障碍。上级号召大家设法研究改进。徐秉衡响应了号召，按着药壶式钎子的结构，划了一张图样，每天下班后回家就研究，有时连饭都顾不上吃。一连十多天，也没找出个门道来，可是他的信心仍然很大，认为：“天下无难事，就怕心不钻”只要尽心研究，一定会想出办法来。有一天他到碎铁堆里找材料，发现了一把破铁钻，这就给了他一个启示：“要做一个象铁钻这样两面有刀刃的钎子，打眼一定能保住中心、打眼也会周正，放炮就不会打筒。”他这样想着，后来又反复的研究试验，到底创造成功了。工友们都很喜欢这个新钎子。使用方便，打眼速度快、旋出的药壶周正，抵抗力平衡，不打筒，爆炸力也大，前进二米五（矿山最高纪录），放一炮能崩十七、八车煤（最高纪录）。工友们看见这个钎子，形状很象飞机的翅膀，便给他起了一个很漂亮的名字，叫“飞机式掏槽钎子”。
    飞机式钎子创出不久，青年团省工委给徐秉衡写去了一封贺信，鼓励他说：“……这是中国工人阶级的光荣，团的光荣，希望你保持这一光荣，更大的发挥力量、继续创造更多的新纪录……。”老徐接到这封信，乐的心花都开了！他特别把“保持光荣，继续创造”这两句话牢牢的记在心里。工厂行政方面则奖给了奖旗，并号召大家学习徐秉衡的创造精神。
    夺取红旗的念头，又挂在老徐的心上了。他这回不是闷着脑瓜自己干了，而是在技术学习班上经常和大家研究，经过努力，又创造了飞机式钎子使用的“掏煤粉器”；改进旋螺丝使用的扳牙架，和职员田向荣共同研究创造了“送药器”。由于他的影响和帮助，团员李景荣也创造了“打岩石的钎子”；团员王忠英改进了“变压器”；团员章仁金改进了“矛头牙轮”。
    徐秉衡的车床上终于插上了一面“创造”奖旗。模范组奖旗，也被他们小组得去了。当人们夸奖徐秉衡的时候，他总是谦虚的说：“不算什么，没有李庆萱同志创造的“药壶式钎子”，我那能创造出“飞机式钎子”？没有党和团的培养，没有大家的帮助，我更谈不到创造了。”
