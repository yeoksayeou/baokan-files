　　Through People's Representatives Conferences at the County Level,
　　Chahar Vigorously Mobilizes Production
　　Promotes Agricultural Science and Technology, and Commends Heroes and Model Workers
    [Report from our newspaper in Zhangjiakou] The second session of the People's Representatives Conference at all levels has been convened successively in all counties of Chahar Province. Except for Chabei, all counties have also convened People's Representatives Conferences at the district level and People's Congresses at the village level. The People's Representatives Conferences at all levels in Zhangjiakou and Datong cities and Zhangbei County have been approved by the provincial government to exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress and have elected mayors, county heads, and government committee members. The Provincial People's Representatives Conference at all levels is also scheduled to be held at the end of May, and a preparatory committee has been established to carry out preparatory work.
    The main content of this People's Representatives Conference at all levels in various counties is to review the implementation of the decisions of the previous conference on winter work, formulate annual production plans, and arrange spring plowing work as the focus. At the meeting, each county formulated this year's production plan based on its specific circumstances, and the representatives guaranteed to complete the resolution. At the same time, the counties also used the meeting to promote agricultural scientific knowledge, adopting methods such as on-site experiments to enable representatives to understand the effectiveness of seed soaking, pest control, and other scientific technologies, and to break the conservative thinking of adhering to old experiences. For example, the representatives of the People's Representatives Conference at all levels in Xuanhua County conducted experiments at the Shalingzi Farm, visited agricultural science exhibitions, and watched the opera "Model Farmer" and Soviet agricultural construction films, which promoted agricultural science and technology. The representatives personally saw the insect eggs in the grain under the microscope and suddenly realized, saying, "The mold of corn is actually caused by poisonous bacteria!" "How can there be a natural disaster for locusts! It's better to use new methods to treat them." In this way, the representatives' confidence in new technologies was improved, and they assured the conference that they would lead the masses to implement them by setting an example.
    At the same time, all counties generally carried out the work of evaluating production models at the meeting and gave spiritual or material rewards. Through the evaluation of models, experiences in production were exchanged, scientific and technological knowledge was promoted, and a public opinion of "labor is glorious" was universally created. Yanggao County did a better job in this movement, turning the meeting into a year-round production mobilization meeting. Both in the general meeting and in the group meetings, speeches were organized on how heroes and model workers took the lead in organizing production and exchanging agricultural technical experience (for example, among the 47 people who spoke at the general meeting of the representatives of all circles in the county, 40 talked about agricultural production), which increased the representatives' confidence in completing this year's production tasks and recognized the benefits of improving agricultural technology. Therefore, the representatives were in high spirits, and after the awards, a challenge competition to ensure the completion of the year's production tasks was launched on the spot. The awarding of heroes and model workers not only stimulated the representatives' enthusiasm for production but also increased their sense of responsibility for organizing the masses to do a good job in production. Some counties and districts and villages also signed "production competition agreements."
    The current meeting of each county generally paid more attention to the breadth of representation than the previous one, and the representatives of all strata accounted for the proportion they should have. Among the farmer representatives, the proportion of middle peasant representatives increased, the number of women representatives also increased, and there were also immigrant representatives, reformed smokers, and loafers, as well as former landlords and rich peasants who had changed their composition and worked well. After the meeting, representatives from all walks of life went back and combined with Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities to widely publicize and convey the achievements and resolutions of the meeting, dispelling the masses' concerns and improving the government's prestige. When summarizing the implementation of last winter's work, the counties reported on their achievements and made profound self-criticisms of the shortcomings in their work. The representatives felt that the People's Government was really "doing its best to seek benefits for the people." Representatives from Zuoyun reflected: "When they come, the people want to ask the government what crops are good to grow? They will grow whatever the government tells them to grow, and they are guaranteed to be right." Some landlords and rich peasants no longer had doubts, and those who worked well and had changed their composition were elected as representatives. Yanggao County accepted the suggestions of the representatives of all circles and punished the derelict district chiefs. The representatives reflected: "This is the people being the masters, and the district chiefs are also under the control of the people!"

　　通过各县各界人民代表会议
　  察哈尔大力动员生产
　　推广农业科学技术评奖英雄模范
    【本报张家口讯】察哈尔全省各县已先后召开了第二次各界人民代表会议；除察北外，各县并召开了区各界人民代表会议和村人民代表大会。张家口、大同两市和张北县的各界人民代表会议并经省府批准代行了人民代表大会的职权，选出了市长、县长和政府委员。省各界人民代表会议亦定于五月底召开，现已成立筹备委员会进行筹备工作。
    各县此次各界人民代表会议的主要内容，均以检查上次会议关于冬季工作的决议的执行情形及制定全年生产计划、布置春耕工作为中心。会上，各县分别根据具体情况，制定了今年生产计划，代表们保证完成决议。同时，各县并利用会议推广了农业科学知识，采用实地试验等方式，使代表们了解浸种、防除虫害等科学技术的效用，打破固执旧经验的保守思想。如宣化县各界人民代表会议的代表，曾在沙岭子农场进行实验，并参观了农业科学展览，又看了推广农业科学技术的歌剧“示范农家”和苏联农业建设影片等。代表们亲自在显微镜下面看到了谷槎中的虫卵，都恍然大悟，说：“玉米的霉，原来都是毒菌闹的！”“闹蝗虫那来的天年呀！还是用新法子治它好。”这样，提高了代表们对新技术的信心，纷纷向大会保证，回去以后要以身作则，带领群众推行。
    同时，各县普遍在会议中进行了评选生产模范工作，并给以精神上或物质上的奖励。通过评奖模范，交流了生产中的经验，推广了科学技术，普遍地造成了“劳动光荣”的舆论。这一运动阳高县作得较好，将会议变成了全年生产动员大会。不论在大会及小组会上，均组织了关于英雄、模范带头组织生产及交流农业技术经验的发言（如该县各界代表会议大会发言的四十七人中，有四十人谈到了农业生产问题），增加了代表们对于完成今年生产任务的信心，并认识了改良农业技术的好处。因此代表们情绪高涨，评奖之后当场就掀起了保证完成全年生产任务的挑战竞赛。评奖英雄模范不仅激励了代表们的生产积极性，更增加了他们组织群众搞好生产的责任心。有的县区与区、村与村之间，还订立了“生产竞赛条约”。
    各县此次会议，较前次一般地注意了代表的广泛性，各阶层代表均占到应有的比例。农民代表中，中农代表比例提高，妇女代表也增多了，并有移民代表以及改造好了的烟民、二流子，改变了成份并且劳动好的旧日地主、富农参加。会后各界代表回去结合春节文娱活动等，将会议成就和决议进行了广泛的宣传、传达，解除了群众顾虑，提高了政府威信。各县在总结去冬工作执行情形时，一方面报告了成绩，同时对工作中的缺点作了深刻检讨，代表们感到人民政府真是“尽为老百姓谋福利”。左云的代表反映：“来时老百姓要问一下政府种什么庄稼好？政府叫种啥，就种啥，保险没错。”一些地主、富农也不再疑虑了，劳动好的、并已改变了成份的，有的已当选为代表。阳高县接受各界代表会建议处分了失职区长，代表反映：“这才是人民作主了，区长也交人民管着啦！”
