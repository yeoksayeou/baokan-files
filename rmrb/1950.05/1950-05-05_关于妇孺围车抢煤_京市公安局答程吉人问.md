　　Regarding Women and Children Surrounding and抢 Coal:
    The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Responds to Cheng Jiren's Inquiry

Editor:

　　Last month, I bought two tons of coal outside Chaoyangmen and hired two donkey carts to haul it back. As soon as I left the station, I saw four or five children in their teens picking up coal outside the coal yard. I thought they were picking up small pieces of coal that had fallen from the coal carts. Unexpectedly, as our coal carts had only traveled a dozen steps, twenty or so children and women ran over from the south side and swarmed around the carts, desperately grabbing coal. I tried to push them away, but they wouldn't leave, and kept following the carts. I really didn't know what to do. One woman in her thirties took a piece of coal weighing more than ten catties from the cart, and I chased after her. She threw the coal into the river. I wonder if this situation happens often? How does the municipal public security organ handle this?

Comrade Cheng Jiren:

    Regarding the matter reported in your letter, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau replies as follows:

    Before the liberation of this city, due to the long-term rule and oppression of reactionary forces, the common people were extremely impoverished, so incidents of surrounding and grabbing coal often occurred. At that time, in the Chaoyangmen area, there were two to three hundred women and children, divided into three gangs: Chaowai Avenue, the south side of the entrance, and the north side, who were organized to steal coal from coal yards and passing coal carts. Each gang had a leader, and they were not allowed to cross boundaries. If they did, they would be beaten, so there was deep animosity between the gangs. After the liberation of Beijing, through investigations by the local public security sub-bureau and the step-by-step implementation of education and mobilization, first of all, the leaders of the gangs, such as Tong (nicknamed Commander Tong), Xie Guo's wife, and Pu Shuzhen, had already gone to the Northwest to participate in production or changed their professions. The majority of the rest have also changed professions. Now there are only twenty or thirty people left, who sometimes still take the opportunity to steal coal. Because we basically treat it as a social problem to be solved, we mainly adopted the methods of transformation through education and helping them change professions. However, because their actions are illegal acts that disrupt social order, in the future, in addition to continuing to strengthen education, assistance, and attention, necessary legal sanctions will be imposed on the main elements who repeatedly fail to reform despite education.

### 关于妇孺围车抢煤  京市公安局答程吉人问

　　关于妇孺围车抢煤
    京市公安局答程吉人问编辑同志：
    上个月我到朝阳门外买了二吨煤，雇了两辆驴车往回拉。一出车站，看见有四五个十几岁的小孩在煤厂的门口外拾煤，我以为他们是拾煤车掉下的小煤块。不料，我们煤车刚走了十几步，从河南面跑来廿几个小孩和妇女，一下拥在车的周围拚命拿煤。我想把他们推开，可是他们都不走开，一直跟着车走，我真没有办法。有一个三十多岁的妇女从车上拿走了一块十几斤重的煤，我就去追她，她把煤投到河里去了。这种情况，不知是否经常有的？本市公安机关对此如何处理？
     华大印厂程吉人程吉人同志：
    来信所报告的事情，北京市人民政府公安局答复如下：
    在本市解放之前，由于反动势力长期统治压榨，老百姓极端贫困，所以围车拿煤的事件，也就经常发生。当时朝阳门一带，即有妇孺二百余人，分成朝外大街、门脸迤南及迤北三帮，有组织的专事偷取煤栈及过往煤车的煤炭。每帮均有领头，互相不许过界，如越界即行围殴，故帮与帮中间仇嫉甚深。北京解放后，经过当地公安分局的调查及有步骤的进行教育动员，首先，各帮的领头如佟氏（外号佟司令）、谢郭氏、普淑贞等，早已去西北参加生产或转业，其余大部分亦分别转业，现在已经只剩二三十人，有时仍然乘隙偷煤。因为我们基本上把它当成一个社会问题来解决，所以主要是采取了改造教育和帮助转业的办法。不过因为他们的行为是破坏社会秩序的违法行动，今后除继续加强教育、帮助和注意外，对于屡加教育不改的主要分子，必要时将予依法制裁。
