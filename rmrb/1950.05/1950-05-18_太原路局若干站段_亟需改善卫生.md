　　Several Stations and Sections of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau
　　Urgently Need Sanitary Improvement
    [Our newspaper Taiyuan dispatch] In order to improve environmental sanitation, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau conducted a general sanitation inspection starting from March 28th, and found that the sanitary work of most stations and sections urgently needs to be improved. According to the investigation: Very few of the 113 stations have spittoons in their offices, and most people vomit on the ground. None of the 31 stations from Lingshi to Fenglingdu has a proper toilet. On the Nantongpu narrow-gauge line, "sealed cars" are used instead of passenger cars, the ventilation equipment is extremely poor, and the light is insufficient, and most vehicles do not have toilets. As soon as the train enters the station, passengers jump off the train and defecate everywhere. The Xinxian station is piled with "historical" garbage piles and ash dregs, and rotten things accumulate in every small alley, and the courtyard is very dirty. These situations seriously threaten the health of workers and passengers. According to this inspection, the railway bureau has separately commended and criticized. At the same time, the railway hospital has organized a sanitation inspection team, which will cooperate with the rectification of passenger transport work and regularly conduct inspections in various units to strengthen publicity and guidance.

　　太原路局若干站段
　　亟需改善卫生
    【本报太原讯】太原铁路局为改善环境卫生，于三月二十八日起普遍进行卫生检查，发现绝大部分站、段卫生工作亟待改进。据调查：一百一十三个站的办公室内设有痰盂者寥寥无几，大都随地呕吐。灵石到风陵渡三十一个站没有一个正规厕所。南同蒲窄轨线路上用“闷子车”代替客车，通风设备极差，光线不足，且大部车辆没有厕所。列车一进站，旅客纷纷跳车随地便溺。忻县站内堆着有“历史性”的垃圾堆和灰碴，每个小夹道内都积有腐烂东西，屋院非常肮脏，这些情况严重地威胁着工友和旅客的健康。根据这次检查，路局已分别进行了表扬与批评。同时，由铁路医院组织了卫生稽查，将配合整顿客运工作，经常到各单位进行检查，加强宣传指导。（张敬光）
