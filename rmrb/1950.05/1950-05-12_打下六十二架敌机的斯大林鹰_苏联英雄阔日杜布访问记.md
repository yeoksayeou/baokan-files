　　The Stalin Eagle Who Shot Down Sixty-Two Enemy Planes
　　A Visit with Soviet Hero Kozhedub
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng

    Twenty-nine-year-old Kozhedub has become an extremely famous figure in the Soviet Union. Children recite his heroic stories, young people take him as a model for learning, and the Soviet people have continuously elected him as a representative to the Supreme Soviet in the general elections of 1946 and 1950.

    The son of a Ukrainian poor peasant, a student at a village primary school, a Young Pioneer with a red scarf, an outstanding student at a youth worker night school and a technical school, a glorious member of the Communist Youth League - this is the path of the young Kozhedub, and also the path taken by millions of Soviet teenagers.

    The young Kozhedub was inspired by the news that two famous Soviet aviators had triumphantly flown over the North Pole to America and resolved to attend technical school during the day and junior aviation school in the evenings. At that time, studying became a heavy burden for him, and the difficulties were great! But Kozhedub, who had been educated from childhood to overcome all difficulties, remembered a saying often told by young people: "If you promise, you must do it; if you do it, you must complete it"! He finally victoriously completed his studies at both the technical school and the junior aviation school. He then completed the courses at the military aviation school with excellent grades, mastering complex technology.

    In 1941, Fascist Germany treacherously invaded socialist Soviet Union. At that time, the German air force outnumbered the Soviet air force and wantonly bombed peaceful Soviet cities and residents. The young Kozhedub, with a high degree of hatred for the enemy and a determination to take revenge, participated in his first aerial combat. This time, eight Soviet planes fought against twenty enemy planes, and the battle took place in enemy-occupied territory. A Junkers (German aircraft) was shot down by Kozhedub - he felt the joy of his first victory. Then, two more enemy planes were shot down, and the remaining enemies fled in panic. They fled so embarrassingly that they even dropped their bombs on their own positions.

    This first battle made Kozhedub realize that although the enemy was ferocious, they were not terrible. As long as he went forward bravely, united and helped each other, and resolutely combined courage with high skill, he could completely defeat the enemy who temporarily had a numerical advantage.

    Another fierce air battle unfolded over the Dnieper River. In ten days of fierce fighting, Kozhedub single-handedly shot down ten enemy planes, for which the Soviet government awarded him the title of Soviet Hero.

    A collective farm member, Gorneyev, used his life savings to buy an airplane and dedicate it to the Stalin Eagles defending the motherland. Kozhedub flew this donated plane to continue fighting and made even more amazing achievements in the Romanian campaign. In the skies above Iasi (Romanian capital), their team of ten planes encountered one hundred enemy planes. In such a precarious situation where the enemy's strength far outnumbered their own, Kozhedub calmly and fearlessly assessed the surrounding situation, first skillfully shooting down the command plane of the enemy formation, causing the enemy's ranks to be thrown into chaos and scattered in flight. By this time, Kozhedub had shot down a total of forty-five enemy planes, and the Soviet government awarded him the title of "Soviet Hero" twice.

    The Soviet army advanced victoriously westward. The Stalin Eagles, in coordination with the army, continued to fight in Latvia, Poland, and finally in the skies above Berlin. In Berlin, the German planes generally did not dare to show their faces. Once, Kozhedub and another plane went out for reconnaissance and suddenly ran into forty enemy planes. For the sake of the motherland, for the sake of Stalin, these two invincible Soviet planes attacked these forty enemy planes. Under the ratio of "one against twenty," they took the initiative to attack. The enemy was stunned by this bold attack. At that moment, Kozhedub achieved victory - two enemy planes were shot down. The Soviet plane flying alongside also shot down an enemy plane. The victorious Kozhedub landed safely.

    Throughout the Great Patriotic War, this brave and fearless Stalin Eagle, Communist Youth League member Kozhedub participated in aerial combat one hundred and twenty times, carried out mission flights three hundred and thirty times, and shot down a total of sixty-two enemy planes. The highest record was six planes shooting down thirty enemy planes. For this, the Soviet government awarded him the title of "Soviet Hero" for the third time. (Attached picture)

　　打下六十二架敌机的斯大林鹰
　　苏联英雄阔日杜布访问记
    本报记者　金凤
    二十九岁的阔日杜布，在苏联已成为极其有名的人物。孩子们念着他的英雄故事，青年们把他作为学习的榜样，苏联人民在一九四六、一九五○年两次大选中，连续把他选为最高苏维埃代表。
    乌克兰贫农的儿子，乡村初级学校的学生，红领巾的少先队员，青年工人夜校和技术学校的优秀学生，光荣的青年团员——这就是少年阔日杜布的道路，也是千百万苏联青少年所走过的道路。
    年轻的阔日杜布，被两位苏联有名的航空家胜利航过北极到达美洲的消息所激动，决心在白天上技术学校，晚上又去初级航校学习。那时学习成为他的沉重的负担，困难是很大的！但从小就被教育着要克服一切困难的阔日杜布记起了青年们常讲的一句话：“你若答应了，就要做到；你做了，就要完成”！他终于胜利地同时完成了技术学校和初级航校的学习。接着以十分优秀的成绩修完了军事航校的课程，掌握了复杂的技术。
    一九四一年，法西斯德国背信进袭社会主义的苏联。当时德寇的空军在数量上超过了苏联，恣意轰炸苏联和平的城市和居民。青年阔日杜布怀着对敌人的高度的憎恨和复仇的决心，参加了第一次空中战斗。这一次是八架苏联飞机对二十架敌机作战，战斗是在敌占区内进行的。一架容克（德机名）被阔日杜布打下去了——他感受到第一次胜利的欢忻。接着，两架敌机又被打下了，余敌仓皇逃遁。他们逃得这样狼狈，甚至把炸弹扔到自己的阵地上。
    这第一次战斗，使阔日杜布认识了敌人虽然凶恶，但是并不可怕，只要勇往直前，团结互助，坚决勇猛结合高度的技巧，完全可以战胜在数量上暂占优势的敌人。
    另一次激烈的空战在德聂泊河上展开。在十天激战中，阔日杜布一人打下了十架敌机，苏联政府为此授予他苏联英雄的称号。
    一个集体农庄的庄员哥聂夫将他一生的积蓄买了一架飞机，献给保卫祖国的斯大林鹰们。阔日杜夫驾驶了这架献机继续作战，在罗马尼亚会战中作出了更惊人的成绩。在雅西（罗京）的上空，他们一队十架飞机遇上了一百架敌机。在这样敌我力量悬隅，十分危急的情势下，阔日杜布冷静无畏地考察了一下周围的情况，首先巧妙地打落了敌机队伍的指挥机，使敌机的阵营大乱，四散逃走。到这时候，阔日杜布一共打下了四十五架敌机，苏联政府两次授予他“苏联英雄”的称号。
    苏军向西胜利前进。斯大林鹰们配合着陆军，继续战斗在拉脱维亚、波兰、最后在柏林的上空。柏林德寇的飞机一般都不大敢抛头露面了。有一次，阔日杜布和其他一架飞机出来侦察，突然撞上了四十架敌机。为了祖国，为了斯大林，这两架无敌的苏机就来攻击这四十架敌机。在“一对二十”的比例下主动进攻。敌人被这大胆的攻击吓呆了。就在这一瞬间，阔日杜布获得了胜利——两架敌机被击落了。同行的一架苏机也打下了一架敌机。胜利的阔日杜布安然着陆。
    在整个卫国战争中，这英勇无畏的斯大林鹰、青年团员阔日杜布参加空中战斗一百二十次，担任了任务飞行三百三十次，共打落敌机六十二架，最高的一次纪录是以六架飞机打落了三十架敌机。为此，苏联政府第三次赠予他“苏联英雄”的称号。（附图片）
