　　May First – Day of Struggle to Defend World Peace
　　Xiao San
    All kind-hearted and righteous people around the world oppose the heinous wars of aggression and the warmongers' conspiracy to conduct another human massacre. This demand, this wish, is now growing stronger day by day and has become an action. All peace-loving people have formed an unprecedentedly broad international front to fight against war instigators and all imperialist conspiracies.

    This is a force that cannot be underestimated, a force sufficient to shake the imperialist aggressive bloc and shatter the evil attempts of the war vendors. It is a force that can truly stop evil wars and maintain world peace.

    Never in human history has there been such a strong movement against war and in favor of peace. It is true that there have always been more people in favor of peaceful coexistence among all peoples of the world than there have been warmongers. But before the Second World War, they had not been able to unite and organize properly. As everyone will remember, in 1932, the World Anti-War Anti-Fascist Congress was held in Amsterdam, Holland. The late famous French writer Henri Barbusse was a powerful organizer and propagandist of this movement (such a meeting was also secretly held in Shanghai, China, which was attended by several international peace representatives). But the Amsterdam Congress was attended by representatives from only twenty-six countries, representing thirty million people. Now things are different. Last year's World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Paris and Prague was attended by representatives from seventy-two countries, representing six hundred million people. After the congress, the Standing Committee and the national peace committees launched a worldwide movement to support peace. One year after the congress, by the time the Third Plenary Session of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace was held in Stockholm in mid-March of this year, one billion people from eighty-one countries around the world had participated in this massive movement to support peace.

    The movement to defend peace has now entered a new, important stage of action and struggle. Tens of thousands of peace committees have been established in countries around the world. All peace-loving people, regardless of political affiliation, religious belief, occupation, or race... have a common goal: to oppose the warmongers' massacre of mankind, to safeguard the peaceful coexistence of peoples and their own peaceful labor, to save their own lives and the lives of their descendants.

    War instigators are frantically expanding their armaments, organizing various aggressive blocs, and attempting to launch a third world war.

    In forty countries, people have launched a movement to reduce armaments.

    The leader of the war instigators – the American imperialists – is desperately promoting the power of the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb, attempting to intimidate innocent people.

    The Third Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace issued a declaration advocating the absolute and unconditional prohibition of such atomic weapons of mass destruction, and the establishment of strict international control to supervise the implementation of this resolution.

    The war instigators, led by U.S. imperialism, are unscrupulously manufacturing atomic weapons in an attempt to kill tens of thousands of people.

    Peace-loving people around the world solemnly declare: any government that dares to use atomic weapons first against any other country shall be treated as a war criminal!

    That is to say, if any government dares to take such a great risk, the entire government and the main responsible persons of the government cannot escape responsibility, cannot escape the severe punishment of the people, even if they flee to the ends of the earth, they must be arrested for trial and punishment.

    This is a declaration formulated by synthesizing the opinions of hundreds of millions of people around the world. This is a stern warning to that barbaric and mad group of war instigators!

    Behind this declaration stand hundreds of millions of people around the world, all well-meaning, upright, conscientious, and determined people. When these people unite, organize, and act, they can break the spine of the imperialist aggressors and war vendors, truly suppress all aggressors, stop war, and maintain peace. Believe in the great power of the people! The warmongers have many tricks. They often use some naive people to spread some vicious "theories" to hinder the struggle to defend peace. For example, in the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries, some people, in order to defend their passive peace propaganda and refuse to take further active struggles, say that they do not believe there is a danger of a new major war.

    Another "theory," which is most widely spread and most dangerous in the United States, is that war is inevitable no matter what. This "theory" was vigorously used by Hitler and Mussolini in the past. It is an attempt to suggest to some mediocre people that your resistance to wars of aggression is useless. This is another provocative statement that hinders the movement to defend peace.

    In addition, there is also a most vicious "theory" spreading in various colonial and dependent countries, which says: "Good, you see, the result of the First World War was the emergence of a socialist Soviet Union. The Second World War produced many new democratic countries. Then, the result of the third world war in the future must be that all colonial and dependent countries will be liberated (!?). People of colonies and dependent countries, welcome the new third world war!" This is another provocative tactic to hinder the movement for peace. It is particularly vicious because imperialist aggressors cannot wage large-scale wars without the support of the material and human resources of colonies and dependent countries. These "theories" were exposed at the Stockholm Conference. The fighters for world peace are more confidently carrying out a very extensive movement to strive for peace and oppose wars of aggression.

    Now, people who used to not care about "meddling in other people's affairs" have joined the movement to strive for peace. Dr. Jones, a professor at Oxford University in the United Kingdom, said: "If someone asks me to participate in the manufacture of atomic bombs and superbombs, I will answer: no, it is too ugly!"

    Fifteen hundred physicists in the United States wrote to Truman asking him to change his policy direction.

    Holding mass rallies; collecting signatures on the declaration of the Standing Committee; petitioning the government; peace relay races... lead to new and broad masses participating in the struggle for peace. Workers in Western Europe, Africa, and Australia refuse to load and unload American weapons, often forcing the American imperialists to change the ports where their ships dock, but every port strikes and protests. Peace-loving people around the world use various methods and various forms of work to resist war instigators.

    Especially since the Stockholm Conference, the movement to support peace in various countries around the world has surged more vigorously. In the past, the peace movement did not penetrate deeply in some places, but now it is developing day by day.

    May First! This day when the working masses of the world review their strength and express their unity has become a day of struggle to defend peace.

    "Workers of all countries, unite and fight for lasting peace and people's democracy! Oppose the instigators of a new war!" "Support the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!"—these are the slogans issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to celebrate this year's May Day Labor Day.

    "Working people of all countries! Expose the evil plans of the warmongers! Expand and consolidate the powerful front of supporters of peace! Defending peace is the cause of all people in the world!"—these are the slogans of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in commemoration of May Day.

    In addition to issuing declarations jointly with the National Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, and the All-China Student Federation to support the call of the Standing Committee, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a notice on commemorating the "May 1st" International Labor Day, which stated: "Consolidating the closer unity between the Chinese working class and the working class of the world... can defend peace in the Far East and the world."

    The World Federation of Trade Unions issued a May Day declaration calling on workers to "turn May Day of 1950 into a worldwide festival in which the working people of all countries actively express their determination to establish a solid and lasting peace in the world."

    The working class and the working people of all countries have always been the most active and heroic vanguards in opposing wars of aggression and protecting peace. On May Day, "working men and women all over the world will enthusiastically sign the solemn declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace,"—the May Day declaration of the World Federation of Trade Unions said.

    On the eve of May Day, the people of France, Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Austria, the German Democratic Republic, West Germany, the United States, Canada, Brazil, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, India, Pakistan, Korea, Japan... either held peace conferences or launched a campaign to sign the declaration of the Standing Committee. The Soviet Union—the great bastion of world peace—is marching forward with big strides, actively building its own economy and culture, and helping the people of the People's Republic of China and various democratic countries build their happy lives through peaceful labor, which provides a particularly powerful guarantee for world peace; at the same time, it is also actively participating in the world movement to support peace, believing that "defending peace is the cause of all people in the world." And the peace representatives and all the people of the Soviet Union, a country that also possesses atomic energy, support the declaration of the World Congress Standing Committee and sign the declaration—this once again proves that the Soviet Union is a truly peace-loving country and the pillar of world peace!

    The victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle has guaranteed peace in the Far East, and at the same time, it has actively participated in the movement to defend world peace, becoming a powerful member of this struggle for the cause of all mankind. The Chinese Committee for Defending World Peace issued a notice to peace-loving compatriots across the country, calling on the people of the whole country to warmly respond to the declaration of the World Congress Standing Committee, "When commemorating this year's May Day Labor Day, launch the most extensive signature campaign demanding the prohibition of atomic warfare, and establish branches of the committee in various central cities to lead various activities to defend world peace." We believe that the peace-loving people of our country will regard May Day as a day of struggle to defend world peace. The scientific community, workers', women's, youth, and student organizations, and religious circles in our country have successively issued declarations supporting the call for peace. At the conference in Beijing commemorating the first anniversary of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, many prominent leaders from our country's cultural, artistic, scientific, educational, news, and religious circles signed their names on the declaration of the Standing Committee on the spot. There is no doubt that there are many more to follow.

    Down with the imperialist instigators of wars of aggression and the conspiracy for a new massacre!
    Take the atomic weapons out of the hands of the bandits!
    Long live the peaceful coexistence and peaceful labor of the people of the world!

　　五一——保卫世界和平的斗争日
    萧三
    全世界一切善心的、有正义感的人们反对罪恶的侵略战争，反对战争挑拨者再一次进行人类大屠杀的阴谋。这个要求，这个愿望，现在已经一天天强烈起来，并且成为行动了。一切爱好和平的人们已经组成了一个空前广泛的国际的战线。以和战争挑拨者，和帝国主义的一切阴谋抗争。
    这是一个不可等闲视之的力量，一种足以动摇帝国主义侵略集团，足以粉碎战争贩子罪恶企图的力量。是一种真正能够制止罪恶战争、保住世界和平的力量。
    人类历史上从来没有过这样强大的反对战争、拥护和平的运动。不错，从来赞成世界各族人民和平共居的人，总是比好战的人要多的多。但是在第二次世界大战发生之前，他们还没有能够好好团结起来和组织起来。大家当还记得，一九三二年在荷兰的阿姆斯特丹姆，举行过世界反战争反法西斯的大会。已经死去的法国著名的作家巴比塞就是这个运动的有力的组织者与宣传者（在中国上海也曾经秘密地开过这样的会，到了几位国际的和平代表）。但是参加阿姆斯特丹姆大会的，只有代表着三千万人的二十六个国家的代表。现在可不同了。去年在巴黎和布拉格开的世界拥护和平大会，到了七十二个国家的代表，代表着六万万人。大会之后，常设委员会和各国的和平委员会，展开了全世界拥护和平的运动。大会后一年，到今年三月中在斯德哥尔摩开世界拥护和平大会常设委员会第三次全会的时候，全世界就有了八十一个国家的十万万人参加这个声势浩大的拥护和平运动。
    保卫和平的运动现在进入了新的重要的、行动和斗争的阶段。成千成万的保卫和平委员会在世界各个国家里建立了起来。一切爱好和平的人们，不分政治派别、宗教信仰，不分职业、种族……他们具有一个共同的目标：反对战争挑拨者对人类的大屠杀，维护人民之间的和平共居，和人民自己的和平劳动，挽救自己一辈的生命，挽救自己的后代。
    战争挑拨者疯狂地扩张军备，组织各种侵略集团，企图掀起第三次世界大战。
    在四十个国家里，人民掀起了裁减军备的运动。
    战争挑拨者的头子——美国帝国主义者拼命宣传原子弹、氢气弹的威力，企图恐吓天真的人们。
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会第三次会议发出宣言，主张绝对无条件地禁止这种大规模毁灭人类的原子武器，并设立严格的国际管制，以监督这个决议的执行。
    以美帝国主义为首的战争挑拨者肆无忌惮地制造原子武器，企图杀死成千成万的人。
    世界爱好和平的人们严厉地宣布：那一个政府胆敢首先使用原子武器来反对任何其他国家的，就要当作战争罪犯来办！
    这就是说，如果有那个政府胆敢冒这个天下之大不韪，这样的整个政府和政府的主要负责人都不能逃避责任，都不能逃避人民严厉的惩罚，那怕他逃到天涯海角，也要抓来审判、办罪。
    这是综合世界成千百万人民的意见而制定出来的宣言。这是对那股野蛮疯狂的战争挑拨者一个严厉的警告！
    在这个宣言的后面，站着世界成千百万的人，一切善意的、正直的、有良心和有决心的人。这些人一团结起来，组织起来，并且行动起来，就能打断帝国主义侵略战争贩子的脊骨，就能真正镇压一切侵略者，阻止战争，保住和平。相信人民的伟大力量吧！战争贩子的挑拨手段是很多的。他们常常利用某些天真的人，散播一些恶毒的“理论”，来妨碍保卫和平的斗争。例如，在英国和斯堪的那维亚各国，有些人们为了辩护自己消极的和平宣传而不肯再进一步作积极斗争时，就说，他们不相信有新的大战发生的危险。
    另一种“理论”，在美国散布得最广，也最危险，那就是说，战争无论如何不能避免。这个“理论”，过去希特勒和莫索里尼就极力利用过的。它是企图给某些庸人暗示说，你们对侵略战争的反抗是没有用的。这是妨碍保卫和平运动的又一个挑拨性的说法。
    此外，还有一种最恶毒的“理论”在各殖民地附属国里传播着，那就是说：“好呀，你看，第一次世界大战的结果，出了一个社会主义的苏联。第二次世界大战产生了许多新民主主义国家。那么，将来第三次世界大战的结果，一定是一切殖民地附属国都获得解放（！？）。殖民地和附属国的人民，你们欢迎新的第三次的世界大战吧！”这又是一种妨碍争取和平运动的挑拨手段。它之所以特别恶毒，是因为帝国主义侵略者假如没有殖民地和附属国的物力人力的支持，是打不起大战来的。在斯德哥尔摩的会议上揭穿了这些“理论”。世界和平的斗士更加有信心地进行争取和平、反对侵略战争的非常广泛的运动。
    现在，一向不管“闲事”的人都加入到争取和平的运动里来了。英国牛津大学的一位教授琼思博士说：“假如有人叫我参加原子弹、超级弹的制造工作，我就回答说：不，这太丑恶了！”
    美国的一千五百个物理学家上书杜鲁门，要求他改变他的政策方向。
    开群众大会；收集在和大常委的宣言上签名；向政府上书；和平通信赛跑……引致新的广大群众参加为和平的斗争。西欧、非洲、澳洲的工人拒绝装卸美国武器，常常使得美帝国主义者改变船只的停舶港口，但每个港口都罢工、抗议。世界爱好和平的人们，用各种方法，各种工作形式来反抗战争挑拨者。
    特别是自从斯德哥尔摩会议以来，世界各国拥护和平的运动，更加蓬勃地高涨了。过去某些地方和平运动没有深入，现在都一天天发展起来了。
    五一！这个全世界劳动群众检阅自己力量和表示团结的日子，成为了保卫和平斗争的日子。
    “全世界工人阶级联合起来，为持久和平与人民民主而斗争！反对新战争的挑拨者！”“拥护以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营！”——这是中国共产党中央委员会所发布的庆祝今年五一劳动节的口号。
    “一切国家的劳动人民！揭露战争贩子的罪恶计划！扩大与巩固强大的拥护和平阵线！保卫和平是全世界一切人民的事业！”——这是苏联共产党中央纪念五一节的口号。
    中华全国总工会除会同全国民主妇女联合会、全国民主青年联合总会，全国学生联合会发表宣言，拥护和大常委的号召外，发出了关于纪念“五一”国际劳动节的通知，里面说：“巩固中国工人阶级与全世界工人阶级更紧密的团结……就能保卫远东和世界和平”。
    世界工会联合会发表五一节宣言，号召工人们“把一九五○年的五一节变成各国劳动人民积极表示要在全世界建立巩固而持久的和平的世界性节日”。
    工人阶级和各国的劳动人民素来是反对侵略战争，保护和平最积极英勇的先锋队。在五一这天“全世界的劳动男女都将在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的庄严的宣言上踊跃签名”，——世界工联五一宣言里这样说。
    在五一前夕，法国、意大利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、波兰、捷克、英国、荷兰、奥国、德意志民主共和国、西德、美国、坎拿大、巴西、荷兰、瑞典、挪威、丹麦、印度、巴基斯坦、朝鲜、日本……的人民或则纷纷举行和平会议，或则发起在和大常委宣言上签名的运动。苏联——这个世界和平的伟大堡垒，更是大踏步地前进，一面积极建设自己的经济文化，一面帮助中华人民共和国和各民主国家人民用和平的劳动建设他们的幸福生活，即此对世界和平作特别有力的保障；同时也积极努力参加世界拥护和平的运动，认为“保卫和平是全世界一切人民的事业”。而苏联这个也拥有原子能的国家的和平代表与全体人民都拥护世界和大常委的宣言，都在宣言上面签名——这就再一次证明苏联是真正爱好和平的国家，是世界和平的砥柱！
    中国人民解放斗争的胜利，使得远东和平有了保障，同时也积极参加保卫世界和平的运动，成为这个为全人类事业而斗争的有力的一员。中国保卫世界和平大会委员会向全国爱好和平的同胞们发出通告，号召全国人民热烈地响应世界和大常委的宣言，“在纪念今年五一劳动节的时候，展开最广泛的要求禁止原子战争的签名运动，并在各中心城市成立本会分会，来领导各项保卫世界和平的活动”。我们相信，我全国爱好和平的人民，都将把五一这个节日作为保卫世界和平的斗争日的。我国的科学界，我国的工人、妇女、青年、学生组织，我国的宗教界……已经先后发表了宣言，拥护和大的号召。在北京纪念世界拥护和平大会一周年的大会上已有不少我国著名的文化艺术科学教育新闻宗教界的领袖们当场就在和大常委的宣言上签了自己的名。继起者还大有人，这是毫无疑问的。
    打倒帝国主义侵略战争挑拨者新的大屠杀的阴谋！
    把原子武器从匪徒手中夺下来！
    世界人民和平共居、和平劳动万岁！
