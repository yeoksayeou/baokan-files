　　Clarifying Property Rights to Overcome Uneven Tax Burdens
　　Land Administration Bureau Pilots On-Site Property Measurement and Registration

　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to ascertain the actual land use situation in the city, clarify property boundary lines, and overcome the phenomenon of uneven real estate tax burdens, the Beijing Land Administration Bureau has decided to conduct on-site measurements of the city's house floor plans and register building conditions. The pilot program for on-site measurement will begin tomorrow (the 15th) in the Inner Second District. The specific on-site measurement will require understanding the four boundaries of the foundation, the building area, whether the owner has changed, and the degree of newness or oldness of the house. The registration will be conducted separately according to the different building materials of each specific house, using scientific methods to determine a score. Due to the large changes in housing over the years, such as additions and demolitions, there is no fixed standard for the degree of newness or oldness in this city, which has led to uneven real estate tax burdens for citizens. After this on-site measurement, the property boundary lines, house categories, and the degree of good or bad condition will be clearly understood. There will be a basis for estimating house prices, and the evaluation of real estate taxes can avoid unevenness.

　　明确产权克服纳税不均现象
　　地政局试办房产实测登记
    【京市新闻处讯】京市地政局为掌握本市土地使用真实情况，明确产权界址，以及克服房地产税负担不均的现象，决定实测全城房屋平面图和登记建筑情况。自明（十五）日开始试办实测内二区。在具体实测时，需要了解地基四界建筑面积，房子种类，业主是否变更，和房屋新旧程度等，按各具体房屋建筑材料之不同，分别登记，以科学方法定出分数。本市由于历年房屋增建、拆除等变化很大，新旧程度没有一定标准，使市民对房产税负担发生不均现象；经过此次实测后，产权界址和房屋类别、好坏程度，有了清楚了解，对房价的估算有了根据，房地产税的评议自可避免不均现象。
