Where Do Disasters Come From?
    Zhou Fang
    In his speech titled "United States Policy Toward Asia" delivered at the California Club in San Francisco on March 15th, US Secretary of State Acheson gloated over China's disasters, saying, "Today, China faces the prospect of 40 million people starving between now and the next harvest. Millions will die." This is a completely shameless fabrication. The population of disaster-stricken areas in China last year was about 40 million, but this was not, as Acheson said, a population all of whom were "starving." This is only a statistic of the entire population of the disaster areas, of which 20 percent can support themselves due to savings or other income, and 60 to 70 percent can overcome the disaster through organized production; the remaining 10 to 20 percent must be given relief to overcome the disaster. Our People's Government has been and is carrying out this relief. To date, thanks to the concerted efforts of governments at all levels and the people, I can guarantee that disaster victims will be able to save themselves through production and will not starve to death. Acheson's assertion that "millions will die" merely reflects the subjective and malicious wishes of American imperialists.
    Acheson's "concern" for China's disasters inevitably leads people to ask, what is the relationship between China's current disasters and American imperialism? How did China's disasters come about?
    China's current disasters are mainly caused by last year's floods. After the summer of last year, there was excessive rainfall, which caused floods in various places. The most serious were in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the middle reaches of the Yellow River, specifically in the Subei and Wanbei regions, and the Pingyuan and Henan provinces. The affected area reached more than 52.6 million mu, with a population of more than 17 million. The occurrence of floods in the above-mentioned areas, in addition to the direct natural factor of excessive rainfall last summer, is fundamentally due to the evil consequences of the long-term criminal rule and crazy destruction of the Kuomintang bandit gang in the past. Most of these areas are newly liberated areas. In the past, under the long-term reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, dikes and embankments were in disrepair for many years, and flood prevention organizations and equipment were completely abandoned. In addition, the Kuomintang bandit army arbitrarily destroyed dikes and dug trenches, making the already dilapidated embankments even more dilapidated. Therefore, when floods broke out last summer and autumn, it was difficult to control them. Not only that, when dangerous situations occurred in various places last year, the Kuomintang bandit gang also sent US-made aircraft to bomb and strafe along the rivers, and instigated secret agents and bandits to step up sabotage activities, harming the people who were trying to rescue and obstructing emergency rescue projects. The following facts clearly show that the floods that occurred in various places last year were the direct and indirect result of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang inflicting disasters on the Chinese people.
    The continuous floods in the Huai River basin originated from Chiang's bandits breaching the dike at Huayuankou.
    In 1938, when the Japanese invaders attacked the Central Plains, the incompetent Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to block the enemy with the natural barrier of the Yellow River, and then opened the Yellow River dike at Huayuankou in eastern Henan. As a result, the rolling Yellow River water rushed into the Huai River, passing through 13 counties in eastern Henan and northern Anhui, drowning hundreds of thousands of people and displacing millions of people, creating the Yellow River flooded area, which is still a wasteland today. In addition, the Yellow River water contained a large amount of sediment, which caused the inner riverbed to silt up, the culverts to be submerged, and the river mouth to become shallow. The water of the inner river had nowhere to discharge, and it flooded every rainy season. Since then, not only has the Yellow River frequently flooded, but the Huai River has also been plagued by disasters year after year. For example, in the Wanbei area, due to the silting up of the Huai River channel, the Huai River flooded in the autumn of 1949, flooding more than 10 million mu of land and affecting a population of more than 3 million.
    During the rule of Chiang's bandits in southern and northern Anhui, river embankments were in disrepair for many years, resulting in serious floods last year.
    In the southern and northern Anhui areas along the Yangtze River, the floods last year and this year were serious. Before liberation, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in these areas, most of the dikes and weirs were in disrepair for many years. Some weirs and dikes were not built according to the water volume standards, and the height and width of the weirs and dikes were not up to standard. For example, the Baoda Weir Jiangdi dike from Fanchang to Dangtu in southern Anhui needs a top width of 6 to 8 meters and a height of 11.8 to 13.6 meters according to the 1931 water level standard, but the construction of the Jiangdi dike not only differed by several meters in height, but the top width was only 3.2 meters, less than half of the standard. Therefore, whenever summer and autumn floods occurred, they would collapse and cause disasters. After the liberation of this area, the People's Government led the local masses to the dikes to fight for rescue in May 1949, and fought hard for three consecutive months, protecting nearly a hundred weirs and dikes; however, 309 weirs and dikes were still in disrepair due to the Kuomintang rule for many years, and were severely damaged, resulting in the collapse and disaster. For example, at the breach of the Mogou Bay of the Dagong Weir in Dangtu, the standard width of the top of the weir was 3.5 meters, but it was actually built at 1.9 meters, which made the dike thin and weak, and it collapsed during the flood last year. Under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Wangjiang, Susong, Huaining and other counties in northern Anhui, the Jiangdi dike along the river and the inner lake weirs and dikes collapsed year after year, but the Kuomintang bandit gang ignored them. In the great flood of the Yangtze River in 1948, more than 90 places on the Jiangdi dike in various counties along the river were destroyed. The people of Wangjiang prepared to build the Wangjiang water dike and concentrated 200,000 kilograms of rice, but it was embezzled by Huang Weidong, the fake Wangjiang County Water Conservancy Engineering Committee, so they were unable to build it. In January 1949, in order to save themselves, the people of Wangjiang spontaneously organized to repair the Jiangdi dike and the inner lake weirs and dikes, but the Kuomintang bandit army arrested the dike repair workers as draftees, forcing the common people to flee east and west, and no one dared to repair the Jiangdi dike and the weirs and dikes.
    In the spring of 1949, Chiang thief attempted to prevent our army from crossing the river to the south, so he arbitrarily dug fortifications and wantonly destroyed the Jiangdi dike along the Yangtze River. Only around the Shuangchen Weir in Pucheng District, Jiangpu County, northern Anhui, more than 4 li, the Chiang bandit dug 10 fortresses and 3 gaps in the weir dike, the largest gap being 140 steps wide, and traffic trenches were dug everywhere on the weir. For example, near Huayang in Wangjiang East, 10 large bunkers were dug, hollowing out many places on the Jiangdi dike, making the already dilapidated embankment even more dilapidated. When the river flooded last autumn, more than 30 places on the Jiangdi dike breached, causing a serious flood in the area along the river last year.
    During the Huaihai Campaign, Chiang's thieves struggled to the death and carried out large-scale destruction, resulting in the disaster area of ​​the Su County area in northern Anhui today.
    The Su County area in northern Anhui is currently the most serious disaster area in the country. During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, it suffered from natural disasters such as floods, droughts, insects, and hail. Millions of people struggled and lingered under the threat of hunger and disease. The disasters created by Chiang's bandit army: burning, killing, looting, and robbery, brought the people of the area to the brink of extinction. In December 1948, when Chiang's bandits Du Yuming and his troops were besieged in Nianzhuang and Shuangduiji in northern Huai, and in the border areas of Xiao County, Su County, and Yongcheng, they carried out large-scale destruction. All the property of the local people was robbed, firewood, furniture, wooden pillars, door frames, and roofs were burned for cooking, and food was robbed and eaten. For example, more than 100 villages in Yongcheng have been burned into scorched earth by the bandit army. In more than 30 villages including Huzhuang, Jiazhuang, Lizhuang, Zhaoyuan, and Lucaiyuan on both sides of the Lu River south of Lishilin and north of the Hai (zhou) Zheng (zhou) highway, houses, furniture, and coffins in the graves were dug up and burned by the bandit army. In total, 1,036 villages were destroyed by the bandit army, totaling 33,656 households, with more than 193,000 disaster victims, more than 70,000 houses destroyed, and more than 10,000 heads of livestock slaughtered. The trees in the area were all cut down by the bandit army, which is also one of the reasons for the serious disaster situation in Su County today.
    The United States designed the Yellow River strategy for Chiang's bandits, wanting to flood the liberated areas.
    The severe disaster situation in the Yellow River basin in our country today most prominently illustrates the crimes of the American and Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries who brought water disasters to the people of our country. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, when Chiang Kai-shek was actively preparing to launch an anti-people civil war, American imperialism designed the Yellow River strategy for him, attempting to force the Yellow River to return to its old course and flood the liberated areas, in order to create military and economic difficulties for the liberated areas. The Chiang bandit gang dreamed of using this to encircle and annihilate the People's Liberation Army. Chiang Kai-shek once boasted: "One Yellow River is worth 400,000 troops." In January 1946, the Chiang Kai-shek government and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) China Office under American control proposed this plan for the Yellow River to return to its old course. In order to take the overall situation into consideration and avoid destroying other river systems, the People's Government of the liberated areas did not hesitate to sacrifice local interests, persuaded 400,000 residents in the old riverbed to relocate, and held talks with the Kuomintang authorities. From April 1946, the Kaifeng Agreement, Heze Agreement, Nanjing Agreement, Shanghai Agreement, etc. were signed successively. These agreements stipulated that the dikes should be restored first, the residents of the riverbed should be relocated, and then the gap should be closed to return the Yellow River to its old course.
    However, the perfidious Chiang Kai-shek government tore up the agreement, ignoring the life and death of the people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, and went all out to carry out the Huayuankou closure project. With the determination of "stopping military transportation, not stopping river transportation," it issued a strict order to its closure bureau: "Complete within the time limit, or be killed." At that time, Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi and his Minister of Water Conservancy Xue Dubi personally supervised the closure at Huayuankou. On March 15, 1947, when the dike restoration project in the Yellow River's old course in the liberated areas of Pingyuan and Shandong had not yet been completed, the Kuomintang reactionaries, at the instigation of American imperialism, closed the gap at Huayuankou. From then on, the people of Pingyuan Province and Shandong Province had to fight hard against the Yellow River water every year.
    Chiang's thieves used American-aided airplanes and artillery to bomb and shell the river repair workers.
    After the closure of Huayuankou, the people of the liberated areas on both sides of the Yellow River fought against the Yellow River water for their survival, and went all out to repair the river embankments and dangerous works on the 1,000-li dike line from northern Henan in the west to Shandong in the east. At this time, the Kuomintang bandit army bombarded day and night with artillery and bombed with airplanes the river repair workers along the river. The People's Liberation Army captured the order issued by Liu Ruming, commander of the Zhengzhou West District, in Hejin on April 17 (this is just one of the many orders issued by the Chiang bandit army along the Yellow River), which stated: "If enemies are found on the other side, they should be bombarded with artillery and destroyed." At that time, Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Yongjin walked 500 li along the Yellow River and reported that the Chiang bandit army shelled our dike repair workers, saying: "When I arrived in Hexi (Hexi is a newly established county in the Jiluyu Liberated Area), more than 15,000 farmers in the county were repairing the Yellow River dike day and night; vehicles transporting stone materials were endless along the way. The reporter accompanied Director Li of the repair section to inspect the river embankment. The 73rd Army and the 13th Army of the Chiang army on the east bank frequently bombarded with artillery fire, and they had to lie down and hide every few steps. When they arrived at the embankment, they saw two farmers, Zhuang Qingjin and Zhuang Hezu, who were carrying soil, seriously injured by the bombing and unconscious. Director Li told the reporter: Since the dike repair, Hexi County alone has suffered 175 casualties of workers and more than 40 cattle."
    When the autumn flood came in August 1947 and the Yellow River water rose, the Chiang bandit gang wantonly bombed the river dikes, causing floods to wreak havoc. More than 100 villages in Juancheng and Yuncheng counties were flooded, and the disaster victims struggled for survival in the flood, and were shot by Chiang's aircraft, which was extremely tragic. A Xinhua News Agency reporter went to the disaster area on August 3 to investigate. Qu Jifu, a boatman from Liuzhuang Village in Yunbei County, told the reporter: "More than 40 families in the village were flooded. I rowed a boat to save people. Just after rescuing six people, two of them were injured by Chiang's aircraft." The reporter went along the dike to Yunbei. The dike was full of homeless disaster victims. Before walking six li, I encountered Chiang's aircraft strafing three times, and witnessed the disaster victim Qian Jiuhe and his daughter being shot and killed by Chiang's aircraft in Wuxi Village. Under the crazy harassment of Chiang's aircraft, the river workers along the river could only change to repairing the dike at night. The heinous Kuomintang bandit gang did not relax its destruction, and used the American-supplied aircraft bombs to bombard the hundreds of li of river dikes in the Juancheng and Yuncheng line at night, causing great obstacles to our night repair. According to the statistics of the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau, in July alone, there were 97 American-made Chiang's aircraft bombing and strafing 29 times along the river, killing and injuring 13 river management workers, killing and injuring 126 livestock, and destroying 45 material transport vehicles and 30 boats.
    Chiang's thieves sent troops to dig up the river dike, the sound of the water was deafening, and it could be heard for dozens of miles.
    On August 17, 1947, the Chiang army dug up two breaches at Qian'ewan and Xinzhuang (located northeast of Guantai) on the Linhuang dike in Guantai, Lanfeng, with a width of more than 100 zhang. The滔天 Yellow River water rushed northward from the breaches and poured down. The sound of the water was deafening and could be heard for dozens of miles. The huge project completed by hundreds of thousands of migrant workers in the liberated area day and night was on the verge of destruction. When the bad news came, the vast number of people in the counties along the river went all out to rush to block and rescue with extremely angry feelings, regardless of everything. However, the Chiang bandits who dug up the dike blocked the breach and did not allow the local people to rush to block the breach. For example, the masses in Quhe County rushed to block the breach several times, but were dispersed by the Chiang bandit army. On the 18th, the water level rose sharply, and the villages south of Huanglingji became a泽国. Chiang bandit's behavior of destroying the Yellow River dike again drove thousands and tens of thousands of hard-working and peaceful people into disaster.
    The evil consequences planted by the Chiang bandit army's years of harassment and destruction, when the autumn flood came last year, the Songjiaquanzi in Kenli, Shandong and the Zhangzhuang section in Shouzhang County, Pingyuan Province, breached and caused disasters, flooding more than 1.6 million mu of land and affecting more than 600,000 disaster victims.
    Who is the creator of the disaster?
    The above is a record of some of the many facts of the Chiang Kai-shek government's destruction of China's water conservancy projects with the assistance of the US government. People can judge who is the creator of today's disasters in China based on the records of these facts.
    These facts prove that although the Chinese people have suffered from more than 100 years of aggression by imperialism and thousands of years of rule by feudal forces, there has never been an imperialism like American imperialism, and there has never been an autocratic ruler like the Kuomintang reactionaries, the lackeys of American imperialism, who have so seriously damaged China's long-standing water conservancy projects, causing serious floods.
    However, the Chinese people who have stood up, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, have not only overthrown the reactionary rule of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, but also healed the wounds inflicted on China by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, overcome the disaster, and in fact, the disaster has stopped developing. Acheson's gloating statement about the disaster in China will not achieve any other result except to increase the Chinese people's hatred for American imperialists.

　　灾荒从何而来？
    周方
    美国国务卿艾奇逊三月十五日在旧金山加利福尼亚俱乐部发表的题为《美国对亚洲的政策》的演说中，对我国的灾荒，幸灾乐祸地说：“今天中国面对着四千万人民在现在与下一收割之间挨饿的前途。数以百万计的人会死亡。”这完全是无耻的捏造。中国去年受灾区的人口约为四千万，这并不是如同艾奇逊所说的都是“挨饿”的人口。这只是灾区全部人口的统计，其中百分之二十的人口由于有积蓄或有其他收入可以自力更生，百分之六十至七十的人口经过组织生产即可渡过灾荒；其余百分之十至二十，须分别予以救济，才能渡过灾荒。我国人民政府已经及正在进行这种救济。截至今天为止，由于各级人民政府和人民的一致努力，我已可以保证灾胞生产自救，不致饿死。艾奇逊所说的“数以百万计的人将会死亡”的断语，只是反映了美国帝国主义者主观上的恶毒愿望罢了。
    艾奇逊这样“关心”我国的灾荒，使人们不由得要问，中国目前的灾荒与美帝国主义有什么关系呢？中国灾荒是怎样发生的？
    中国目前的灾荒主要是去年的水灾所造成。去年入夏以后雨水过多，造成了各地的水灾，最严重的是长江中下游和黄河中游地区之苏北、皖北两区和平原、河南两省，受灾面积达五千二百六十余万亩，人口一千七百余万。上述地区水灾的发生，除了因为去年入夏雨水过多的直接的自然因素之外，根本上是由于过去国民党匪帮长期罪恶统治和疯狂破坏所种下的恶果。这些地区大部分都是新解放区，过去在国民党长期反动统治下，堤防年久失修，防汛组织和设备完全废弛，加之国民党匪军任意炸毁堤防，挖掘战壕，使原已颓败的堤岸更加残破不堪，因而去年夏秋洪水暴发，即难收拾。不仅如此，当去年各地险象发生后，国民党匪帮又加派美制飞机在沿江沿河炸轰扫射，并策动特务土匪加紧破坏活动，残害抢险人民，阻挠急救工程。下面的许多事实，使人清楚看到：去年各地所发生的水灾，直接和间接都是美国帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮加祸于中国人民的结果。
    淮河流域连年水灾起因于蒋匪花园口掘堤。
    一九三八年日寇进攻中原时，无能的国民党反动派企图以黄河天险阻挡敌人，遂将豫东花园口黄河堤岸掘开，结果滚滚黄水，奔腾入淮河，经过豫东、皖北十三县，淹死几十万老百姓，使几百万老百姓流浪他乡，造成现在仍然是一片荒原的黄泛区。加之黄水含有大量泥沙，致使内河河床淤高，涵闸淹没，河口淤浅，内河之水无处宣泄，每至雨季即泛滥成灾。自此以后，不仅黄河频频泛滥，淮水也连年成灾。如皖北地区，由于淮河河道淤塞，一九四九年秋淮河即泛滥成灾，被淹田地一千余万亩，受灾人口达三百余万。
    皖南、皖北在蒋匪统治时，河堤年久失修，致造成去年严重水灾。
    在长江沿岸的皖南，皖北地区，去年和今年的水灾是严重的。这些地区在解放前，在国民党反动派统治时期，大部堤圩年久失修。有的圩堤也不按水量标准修筑，圩堤的高度宽度均不合格。如皖南繁昌至当涂段的保大圩江堤，按照一九三一年水位的标准，堤顶宽度需六至八公尺，高度需十一点八至十三点六公尺，但该江堤的修筑，不但高度相差数公尺，堤顶宽度只三点二公尺，不及标准的一半。因此，每当夏秋洪水泛滥时，即溃决成灾。该地解放后，人民政府于一九四九年五月即领导当地群众上堤抢险，连续苦斗三个月，保护了近百圩堤；但仍有三百零九个圩堤由于国民党统治时年久失修，残破不堪，致溃决成灾。又如当涂大公圩磨口湾决口处，圩顶标准宽度需三点五公尺，但实修了一点九公尺，致使堤圩单薄，抵抗力弱，而于去年洪水泛滥时决口成灾。皖北望江、宿松、怀宁等县在国民党匪帮长期统治下，沿江将近四百华里的江堤和内湖圩堤年年崩溃，但国民党匪帮均置之不理。一九四八年长江大水，冲毁沿江各县江堤达九十余处。望江人民准备修筑望江水堤，集中大米二十万斤，但被伪望江县水利工程委员会黄维栋侵吞一光，因而无力修筑。一九四九年一月，望江人民为了拯救自己，又自动组织起来修整江堤和内湖圩堤，但国民党匪军竟以修堤民工为对象，大肆抓丁，迫使老百姓东逃西散，江堤、圩堤也就无人敢于修筑了。
    一九四九年春，蒋贼妄图阻止我大军渡江南下，乃在长江沿岸江堤滥挖工事，疯狂破坏，仅皖北江浦县浦城区双陈圩周围约四里余，圩堤被蒋匪挖了十个堡垒，三个缺口，最大缺口达一百四十步宽，圩上并到处挖上交通沟。又如在望江东之华阳附近即挖大型碉堡十座，将江堤很多地方掏空，使原已颓败的堤岸更加破烂不堪。去秋江水泛滥时，有三十余处江堤决口，致造成去年沿江地区的严重水灾。
    淮海战役时，蒋贼临死挣扎，大肆破坏，造成今日皖北宿县专区灾区。
    皖北宿县专区是目前全国最严重的灾区，在国民党匪帮统治时，曾连遭水、旱、虫、雹等天灾的侵袭，千万人民在饥饿、疾病的威胁下挣扎，苟延喘息。蒋匪军所制造的灾祸：烧、杀、抢、劫，使该区人民更濒于绝境。一九四八年十二月蒋匪杜聿明等部被围于淮北之碾庄、双堆集、及萧县、宿县、永城边境地区时，大肆破坏。当地老百姓的财产全被抢光，柴草、家具、木柱、门框、屋顶被做饭烧光，粮食被抢完吃光。如永城百余个村庄，已被匪军烧成一片焦土。在李石林以南之鲁河两岸、海（州）郑（州）公路北侧的胡庄、贾庄、李庄、赵园、陆菜园等三十余村庄，房屋家具以及坟墓内的棺材都被匪军掘烧殆尽。总计当时被匪军破坏的村庄一千零三十六个，共三万三千六百五十六户，灾民达十九万三千余人，被毁房屋七万余间，被屠耕畜一万余头。该地区的树木全被匪军砍尽，也是造成今日宿县专区严重的灾情的原因之一。
    美国为蒋匪设计黄河战略，想要水淹解放区。
    目前我国黄河流域灾情严重，最突出地说明了美蒋反动派加水祸于我国人民的罪行。一九四五年日寇投降以后，蒋介石积极准备发动反人民内战时，美国帝国主义为之设计黄河战略，企图强使黄河归故，水淹解放区，以造成解放区军事上、经济上的困难。蒋匪帮梦想以此来围歼人民解放军。蒋介石曾吹嘘：“一条黄河抵得上四十万大军。”一九四六年一月，蒋介石政府与美国操纵下的联总中国分署提出这一黄河归故的计划。解放区人民政府为了顾全大局，不使破坏其他河流水系，乃不惜牺牲局部利益，说服故道河床四十万居民，进行迁移，并和国民党当局进行会谈。自一九四六年四月起，先后签订开封协议，菏泽协议、南京协议、上海协议等。这些协议规定，要先行复堤，迁移河床居民之后，再堵口合龙，使黄河归故。
    但是，背信弃义的蒋介石政府撕毁协议，不顾黄河下游人民的死活，全力疯狂进行花园口堵口工程。并以“宁停军运，不停河运”的决心给其堵复局下了“限期完成，不成则杀”的严令。当时蒋匪国防部长白崇禧及其水利部长薛笃弼等均亲临花园口监督堵口。一九四七年三月十五日，当平原、山东等地解放区黄河故道复堤工程尚未完成之时，国民党反动派即在美帝国主义唆使下，将花园口堵口合龙。从此，平原省与山东省人民就要年年和黄水进行苦斗。
    蒋贼利用美援飞机大炮，轰炸和炮击修河民工。
    花园口合龙后，黄河两岸解放区人民为着生存与黄水作斗争，乃在西起豫北东至山东的一千余里堤线上，全力抢修沿河堤防险工。这时，国民党匪军却日夜不停地用大炮轰击和用飞机轰炸沿河修堤民工。人民解放军缴获郑州西区司令官刘汝明四月十七日在河津发出的命令（这只是沿黄河蒋匪军许多命令之一），内称：“对岸如发现有敌人时，即用炮轰并破坏之。”当时新华社记者陈勇进沿黄河步行五百里，报道蒋匪军炮轰我修堤员工时说：“到河西时（河西是冀鲁豫解放区的新设县），该县一万五千余农民正在昼夜抢修黄河堤防；沿途运输石料的车辆络绎不绝。记者随该修防段李主任至河堤视察，河东岸蒋军七十三军和十三军各一部频频以炮火轰击，每行数步必须卧下隐藏。至堤上时，还见担土农民庄庆金和庄合壻两人被炸重伤，昏厥不醒。李主任告记者说：修堤以来，仅河西县就伤亡了一百七十五个工人和四十多头牛。”
    一九四七年八月秋汛到来，黄河水涨，蒋匪帮就恣意滥炸河堤，使洪水冲泻成灾。鄄城、郓城两县百余村被淹，灾民在洪水中挣扎求生，复遭蒋机射击，惨绝人寰。新华社记者曾于八月三日至该灾区勘察，有郓北县刘庄村水手屈纪福告记者说：“村中四十多家被淹了，我划上船去救人，刚救起六个，就被蒋机打伤了两个。”该记者沿大堤至郓北，堤上尽是无家可归的灾民。行走不到六里，即遇到蒋机三次扫射，在武西庄目击灾民钱九合及其女被蒋机机枪打死。在蒋机疯狂地袭扰下，沿河民工只能改在黑夜修堤，万恶的国民党匪帮仍不放松破坏，又使用美国供给的飞机炸弹，在夜间轮番滥炸我鄄城、郓城一线数百里河堤，使我夜间抢修也遭受极大阻碍。据山东省河务局的统计，仅七月份即有美制蒋机九十七架沿河轰炸扫射二十九次，死伤治黄员工十三名，死伤牲口一百二十六头，炸毁运料车四十五辆，船三十只。
    蒋贼派兵掘开河堤，水声震天，声闻数十里。
    一九四七年八月十七日，蒋军更在兰封境内贯台临黄堤上挖掘前鹅湾、辛庄两缺口（位于贯台东北），宽达百余丈，滔天黄水，乃自缺口中奔腾北流，倾泻而下，水声震天，声闻数十里。经解放区数十万民工日夜抢修而完成的浩大工程，濒于毁灭。恶讯传来，沿河各县广大人民，乃以极度激愤心情不顾一切进行抢堵抢救。但是掘堤的蒋匪军把住决口，不准当地人民抢堵决口，如曲河县群众几次抢堵，均被蒋匪军击散。十八日，水势猛涨，黄陵集以南村庄均成泽国。蒋匪的这种破坏黄河堤防的行为，又将成千成万的勤劳的和平人民驱入灾难中。
    蒋匪军连年的袭扰和破坏种下的恶果，当去年秋汛时，山东垦利宋家圈子和平原省寿张县张庄段即决口成灾，被淹田地一百六十余万亩，灾民六十余万。
    谁是灾荒的制造者？
    以上就是蒋介石政府在美国政府的协助下破坏中国水利工程的许多事实中的一部分记载。人们可以根据这些事实的记录去判断谁是今日中国灾荒的制造者。
    这些事实证明：中国人民虽然遭受了帝国主义一百余年的侵略和封建势力的几千年的统治，从来还没有过一个帝国主义，如同美帝国主义那样，还没有过一个专制统治者如同美帝国主义者的走狗国民党反动派那样，这样严重地破坏中国的年代久远的水利工程，造成严重的水灾。
    但是，已经站起来的中国人民，在中央人民政府的领导下，不但已经推翻了美国帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的反动统治，而且还要医治好美国帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮所加于中国的创伤，战胜灾荒，而且实际上灾荒已停止发展了。艾奇逊关于中国灾荒的幸灾乐祸的声明，除了增加中国人民对于美国帝国主义者的仇恨而外，再也不会得到任何别的结果。
