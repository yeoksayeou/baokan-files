　　Mudanjiang City's Twenty-Three State-Owned Enterprises
　　Exceed Last Month's Production Targets
    [Our Newspaper Mudanjiang News] Twenty-three state-owned and public enterprises and factories in Mudanjiang City, including the Mudanjiang Thermal Power Plant and the Songjiang Provincial Paper Mill, have successfully completed and exceeded their production targets for April. The state-owned Thermal Power Plant ensured safe power transmission in April and completed the safe combined operation with the Jingbo Lake Hydropower Plant, eliminating the phenomenon of power outages of one or two minutes during the switch between the two plants, which was previously necessary. The technology of combined operation has reached the level of the puppet Manchukuo period. The provincial Songjiang Paper Mill exceeded its monthly target, improved quality compared to the past, and reduced costs. The Mudanjiang City Construction Company and Automobile Company both exceeded their targets by 30 percent. Lecheng Electric Company, Northeast First Textile Factory, and fourteen other factories have all exceeded their production targets. The Forestry Bureau Lumber Mill, Mudanjiang Lumber Mill, and five other factories have also completed their April production targets according to plan.
    The main reasons for these factories' completion and exceeding of production targets are: First, the establishment of a production responsibility system. The majority of workers have universally launched production emulation campaigns, demonstrating high labor enthusiasm to complete the April production tasks ahead of schedule and to greet the first "May Day" Labor Day after the founding of New China. Second, the Party, government, and labor union of each factory closely cooperated, and leading comrades went deep into the front lines to provide concrete leadership. For example, during the power transmission task from April 5th to 11th, the director and deputy director of the power plant personally went to the site for overnight shifts, greatly boosting the workers' production enthusiasm. When brushing and washing the No. 5 boiler, the factory director and the chairman of the labor union personally climbed into the boiler to inspect the brushing and washing conditions to prevent accidents, thus ensuring the safe power transmission task.

　　牡丹江市二十三个公营企业
　　超额完成上月生产任务
    【本报牡丹江讯】牡丹江市火力发电厂、松江省造纸厂等廿三个国营公营企业工厂，已胜利完成并超过四月份的生产任务。国营火力发电厂在四月份保证了安全送电并完成与镜泊湖水力发电厂合车安全送电，消灭了过去水、火两厂换电时须停电一二分钟的现象。在合车的技术上已达到伪满时水平。省营松江造纸厂全月任务超额完成，质量比过去提高，成本则减低了，牡丹江市营土建公司及汽车公司均超过任务百分之三十。乐成电气公司、东北第一纺织厂等十四个厂，都已超过生产任务。林务局制材厂、牡丹江制材厂等五个工厂，也都按计划完成四月份生产任务。
    这些工厂完成与超过生产任务的主要原因是：第一、建立了生产责任制。多数职工普遍开展了生产竞赛运动，发挥了高度劳动热情，以提前完成四月份的生产任务，迎接新中国成立后的第一个“五一”劳动节。第二、各厂党、政、工密切配合，领导同志深入现场，具体领导。如在四月五日至十一日的送电任务中，发电厂正副厂长均亲往现场值宿（夜班），大大鼓舞了工人的生产情绪。在刷洗五号锅炉时，厂长和工会主任亲自爬进锅炉里去检查刷洗情况，防止事故的发生，因此保证了安全送电的任务。（牡丹江市总工会柳克强）
