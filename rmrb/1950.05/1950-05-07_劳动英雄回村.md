Labor Hero Returns to Village
Zhang Mingquan

On January 26th, Mo Baolian, a first-class labor hero from Pingyuan Province, returned to her village, Sangyuan Village in Lin County, after attending a meeting in the province. Mo Baolian lost her mother at the age of seventeen, but under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, she actively participated in agricultural production, overcame family difficulties, and led the entire village in developing a mutual aid movement, achieving many successes. When she returned to the village, the masses spontaneously and enthusiastically welcomed her.

　　The sound of gongs and drums on the street resounded through the sky,
　　Old and young came to the front of the village;
　　To welcome their good daughter,
　　The nineteen-year-old hero, Mo Baolian.

　　A bright pearl held by a thousand hands,
　　Relatives surrounded her in layers;
　　Some carried her, some embraced her,
　　Brothers and sisters came out.

　　The glorious certificate of merit is bright red,
　　The glorious prizes are dazzling;
　　A grand parade with people leading and following,
　　Paraded through the north and south of the village.

　　Glory illuminates the hearts of the people,
　　Glory illuminates Sangyuan Village;
　　The whole village became a scene of laughter,
　　The whole village turned red.

　　“In the old society, the poor were in a fiery pit,
　　The grievances of tears were countless;
　　Living like beasts of burden, sweating blood,
　　Where was there any such glory!

　　“The poor man's daughter was called a 'root of misfortune,'
　　How many people hanged themselves from the rafters;
　　In the new society, women have been liberated,
　　Even top scholars now have sisters!

　　“Born here, grew up here,
　　Lost my mother here;
　　Raised my younger brother here,
　　Completely relied on the Party to overcome difficulties.

　　“Relied on the Party to help overcome difficulties,
　　Relied on the Party to lead the way forward!
　　Dear mother! Dear mother! – The Communist Party,
　　Without you, where would this day have come from!”

　　Green leaves holding up big red flowers,
　　Welcoming the hero to speak;
　　Applause like a thousand flashes of lightning,
　　Slogans shouted like spring thunder.

　　“Glory belongs to our village,
　　Everyone shares in the glory;
　　If we want to maintain this glory,
　　This year's production will increase by two cun!”

　　劳动英雄回村
    张明权
    一月二十六日，平原省一等劳动英雄莫保莲在省里开完会，回到她的村子林县桑园村。莫保莲十七岁上就死了母亲，但她在共产党和人民政府的领导下积极参加农业生产克服了家庭困难，并领导全村开展了互助运动，创造了很多成绩。她回到村上时，群众自动热烈欢迎她。
    街上的锣鼓响连天，
    老老少少到庄前；
    迎接自己的好闺女，
    十九岁英雄莫保莲。
　
    一颗明珠千手捧，
    亲人们围了好几层；
    携的携来抱的抱，
    出来了弟弟妹妹们。
　
    光荣的奖状红艳艳，
    光荣的奖品耀人眼；
    前引后拥大游行，
    游了村北游村南。
　
    光荣照亮了人民的心，
    光荣照亮了桑园村；
    全村成了一片笑，
    全村成了一片红。
　
    “旧社会穷人在火坑，
    窝囊的眼泪量不清；
    牛马血汗为活命呀，
    那里有过这光荣！
　
    “穷人的女儿叫‘祸根’，
    梁头上吊死过多少人；
    新社会妇女翻了身，
    状元里也有了姐妹们！
　
    “在这里生来在这里长，
    在这里失了生身娘；
    在这里扶养了小弟弟，
    过难关完全靠了党。
　
    “靠着党帮助过难关，
    靠着党引路往前干！
    亲娘呀！亲娘！——共产党，
    没有你那来的这一天！”
　
    绿叶叶托起大红花，
    欢迎英雄来讲话；
    巴掌拍得万道闪，
    口号喊得春雷大。
　
    “光荣属于咱们村，
    光荣人人都有份；
    要想保住这光荣，
    今年生产长两寸！”
