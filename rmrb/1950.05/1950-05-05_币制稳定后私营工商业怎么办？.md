　　What Should Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Do After Currency Stabilization?
　　Zhang Naiqi

　　In the New Year, I published "Advising Speculative Merchants to Wash Their Hands Quickly." In that article, I said that military operations have basically passed, and this year's central task will be economic warfare. Now, economic warfare has also achieved a preliminary and great victory! In just over three months, the Chinese people have basically overcome the fiscal deficit, thereby basically overcoming the twelve-year-long inflation.

　　War is cruel, and significant sacrifices are inevitable. The Chinese people suffered countless losses of life and property in the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan and the four-year War of Liberation! So, it's not that we want war. Our warfare is entirely unavoidable. Because the enemy is too ferocious, we cannot live or be human without fighting. This principle needs no explanation. The reason for economic warfare is the same.

　　After the retreat of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, they left us with two economic disasters: inflation and poverty. This is the inevitable result of the enemy's willful plunder and a serious problem that the Chinese people must solve on their own. If we do not further overcome inflation and poverty after militarily defeating the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the victory of the revolution will not be consolidated. Among them, the first step must be to defeat inflation first. Without a stable currency as a foundation, the recovery of production and construction is very difficult, and poverty is also difficult to overcome.

　　The harm of inflation is truly indescribable! Ending inflation and stabilizing prices has been the consistent demand of the Chinese people for more than ten years. This demand could not be resolved in the Kuomintang era because inflation was one of their means of plunder, and they were unwilling to give it up easily. Their political structure, rotten to the core, was also incapable of carrying out this extremely arduous struggle task. Only today's people's own regime can have the determination and strength to carry out this economic warfare and achieve victory. Economic warfare and military warfare are different in their methods, but one thing is the same: they must go through some difficulties. It is impossible to have no difficulties at all.

　　The problem lies here. Economic warfare has achieved a preliminary victory, and prices have been generally stabilized. The people across the country are rejoicing and celebrating this great victory. But, at the same time, difficulties have also emerged. A small number of industrial and commercial enterprises have closed down as a result, and some employees have lost their jobs. Some of the closed industrial and commercial enterprises are speculative, and some, although not speculative, are not what the people need today, and some are even needed by the people. That is to say, difficulties are manifested in all aspects.

　　Many economists have already told us that the pain of currency transitioning from inflation to deflation is even greater than during inflation. However, currency must go through a deflationary process to transition from inflation to stability. Therefore, this kind of pain is unavoidable. Only socialist Soviet Union can substantially increase the value of its currency without feeling any pain.

　　It must be pointed out that government agencies and state-owned enterprises are equally affected by this pain. Managing cash makes it difficult for many state-owned enterprises to circulate funds; downsizing further makes them struggle in carrying out work and handling personnel matters. However, these are all prepared for. The Communist Party never hopes to win by luck—to win a battle without sacrifice. Therefore, the "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work" promulgated on March 3 stated that "We would rather endure some smaller difficulties in order to prevent and avoid greater difficulties." Therefore, the People's Government is leading this economic warfare in the same way as it led military warfare, taking the lead in enduring difficulties, and enduring the current temporary difficulties is for the future happiness of everyone.

　　The above explains that today's difficulties and pain are the residual poison left by the enemy's years of plunder, not created by the People's Government. Once a boil that has grown for more than ten years is cut open and treated, the temporary pain will be greater, but to be a healthy person, it is unavoidable to endure the pain for a while. This is the pain in victory, and everyone can only continue to work hard and move forward to achieve the final and greater victory.

　　Why is the pain greater in Shanghai during this period? That's because Shanghai is the heartland of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and the畸形development of industry has been particularly severe. In addition, the enemy's blockade and bombing are directed at Shanghai, so the pain is naturally greater. This proves that today's pain is given to us by the enemy.

　　Even though the pain is given to us by the enemy, the People's Government is now trying to cure the root cause on the one hand and trying to reduce the pain as much as possible on the other. But reducing pain does not rely on injecting anesthetics, but rather on combining fundamental treatment to make the wound heal sooner. This is what Chairman Mao said at the 7th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on April 14: "In the next few months, the focus of the work of the government's financial and economic leading organs should be on adjusting the relationship between public and private enterprises and various departments of public and private enterprises, and striving to overcome the state of anarchy." At the same meeting, Chen Yun, the person in charge of central finance, also reported: "The Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council is preparing to hold several necessary meetings and formulate several necessary laws in the next few months, and will focus on adjusting industry and commerce. In the six months since the establishment of the Central People's Government, the focus of the work of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council has been on finance, which is entirely necessary, and has therefore achieved the goal of balancing revenue and expenditure and stabilizing prices." It is very clear that stabilizing prices is the foundation for economic recovery; first, use all efforts to balance revenue and expenditure and stabilize prices, and then further adjust industry and commerce to seek economic recovery. The steps are very reasonable and correct.

　　This is a new situation that China has never had before: the country is unified and independent, financial revenue and expenditure are close to balance, prices are stable, and the government is using great efforts to adjust industry and commerce, and is planning to gradually advance the national economy from recovery to development. Under this new situation, what should private industrial and commercial enterprises do?

　　I think, let's examine ourselves! If one's business is speculative, then today, without a plan to change careers, one has to close down sooner rather than later. Speculative business is harmful and useless to the people; it is the pus inside the boil, which must be removed and disinfected before the disease can be cured. Inflation has greatly developed speculative industrial, commercial, and financial businesses. Taking Shanghai as an example, despite the economic decline caused by the war, inflation has greatly increased the number of industrial, commercial, and financial business units. Their existence is completely divorced from the needs of the people. Since they were parasitic on the foundation of inflation in the past, isn't it natural and reasonable for such enterprises to disappear today with the elimination of inflation?

　　Some industrial and commercial businesses are not necessarily speculative, but they have developed from the semi-feudal and semi-colonial social foundation. They do not serve the people, but serve imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Today, these three enemies of the people have fallen, and they have lost their service objects. Unless they can quickly shift their direction and change to businesses that serve the people, elimination is unavoidable.

　　Blindly changing careers is also not feasible. Transferring from speculation to commerce, or from one type of commerce to another, or even from commerce to industries that the people do not need for the time being or do not need so much, will still result in failure. Obviously, commerce is generally excessive. And industrial production cannot be blind. What industries should be transferred to, we cannot have various accurate statistics now—even if the past figures were accurate, they are somewhat inapplicable today, so we cannot have a comprehensive economic plan to specifically stipulate the types and quantities of private industrial and commercial development for the time being. However, the principles have already been pointed out. The direction of development is "facing the people" and "facing the countryside." That is to say, any business that does not manipulate the national economy and the people's livelihood but is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood is the goal and scope of activities for industrial and commercial enterprises to change careers.

　　According to our understanding, the current decline in purchasing power is temporary. In fact, after inflation stops, the people save extremely huge losses from currency depreciation, and these losses should be able to be converted into new purchasing power. However, because in the past, goods were valued more than money, and people desperately rushed to buy goods when they had money; today, money has become more valuable than goods, and those who hoard goods desperately want to exchange them for money, which makes the supply of goods relatively increase greatly. A shop in Beijing posted an advertisement saying "Want money, not goods," which represents the psychology of the general public. This general psychology also makes consumers wait and see, delaying purchases. Some consumers also stored more goods in the past, and now they don't buy them if they have them to use. Some consumers even want to sell excessive consumer goods. As a result, the market has formed a temporary phenomenon of supply exceeding demand. In essence, this is just a delay in purchasing power, not a reduction in purchasing power. After prices have stabilized for a period of time, the delayed purchasing power will be re-launched.

　　Prices can be stabilized by falling. The report of Vice Premier Chen Yun of the State Council has already told us: "Continued price declines are also unfavorable to the national economy. If they continue to decline, the government will take appropriate steps to stabilize them." Everyone can fully believe this revelation, because the government now has the power to control the market, and the Communist Party can do what it says. Once the observation period for consumers has passed, the market can recover. There will be some progress after the summer harvest; as long as the autumn harvest can have a normal year, there can be more progress. However, the basic improvement of the market must be after the complete victory of the war and the land reform fundamentally increases the purchasing power of farmers.

　　If everyone thinks that the above estimate is roughly correct, then the vast majority of industrial and commercial enterprises that are operating properly and are needed by the people should be able to strengthen their confidence. Of course, changes in business policies and improvements in organizational methods and management methods are still necessary. In terms of business policy, in addition to facing the people, facing the countryside, and earnestly paying attention to serving the workers and peasants, it is also necessary to sincerely accept the leadership of the state-owned economy. They should individually and collectively discuss with the leading state-owned economic organs to seek cooperation between the public and private economies to jointly work hard to produce and prosper the economy. The organization must strive for modernization and must not establish feudal relations within the business organization. In management, the old ideas of despising employees must be completely eliminated, and it is necessary to learn to negotiate with the labor side to solve problems. There are already many examples of this kind of positive spirit and progressive work style that have turned danger into safety and reduced difficulties from large to small. Industrialists and businessmen can train themselves in the midst of difficulties and strive for progress, which is not only beneficial to their careers, but also beneficial to their future lives. After the difficulties have passed and the outdated business units have been transformed, there will be no more improper speculation and competition, and the remaining industrial and commercial enterprises will definitely be able to achieve development.

　　Today, no one in the People's Government will regard themselves as omnipotent, like the bureaucrats of the reactionary rule. The style of believing in the people and consulting with the people advocated by the Communist Party is the style of today's government personnel. Therefore, industrialists and businessmen must not blindly rely on the government to point out the way, but should gather together with the same industry to discuss concrete ways to maintain the business. It is only effective to have their own methods and then discuss them with the government and cooperate with the state-owned economy to develop forward. Especially for several important production departments, they must quickly prepare the existing productivity, the productivity that may be improved, and the collectively agreed production plan for the government to hold several necessary meetings in the next few months for reference and discussion. This is one of the democratic rights of industrialists and businessmen. Only with such active efforts can public and private interests be fully realized.

　　Finally, I hope that industrialists and businessmen across the country will not listen to the rumors of the bandits and firmly believe in the government's policies. Politically correct understanding and firm confidence in the new country are of paramount importance for every industrialist and businessman to cope with the current new situation. I believe that industrialists and businessmen in cities that have been liberated for a long time should have already gained such experience in their work.

　　币制稳定后私营工商业怎么办？
    章乃器
    新年，我发表了“劝投机商人赶快洗手”，在那篇文章里，我就说过，军事作战已经基本的过去，今年的中心任务将是经济作战。现在，经济作战又已获得初步伟大的胜利！中国人民在短短的三个多月当中，由基本上战胜了财政赤字，从而基本上战胜了延续十二年的通货膨胀。
    战争是惨酷的，不可避免的要有重大的牺牲。中国人民在八年抗日战争和四年的解放战争中，生命和财产的牺牲几乎难以数计！所以，并不是我们要有战争。我们的作战完全是不得已的。因为敌人太凶暴了，不作战就不得活，就不能做人。这个道理是不必说明的了。经济作战的理由也是如此。
    日寇和蒋介石匪帮败退之后留给我们两个经济上的灾祸：通货膨胀和贫穷。这是敌人恣意掠夺的必然结果，也是中国人民必须自谋解决的严重问题。如果我们在军事上战胜日寇和蒋介石匪帮之后不进一步战胜通货膨胀和贫穷，革命的胜利还是不巩固的。那中间，第一步还必须先战胜通货膨胀。没有稳定的通货为基础，生产建设的恢复是很困难的，贫穷也是很难战胜的。
    通货膨胀的危害真是一言难尽！结束通货膨胀稳定物价是十多年来中国人民一致的要求。这种要求在国民党时代是不可能得到解决的，因为通货膨胀是他们的掠夺手段之一，他们是不肯轻易放弃的。他们那个连根腐烂的政治机构，也是不可能执行这一个极端艰巨的斗争任务的。只有今天人民自己的政权，才可能有决心、有力量进行这一场经济作战，而取得胜利。经济作战和军事作战的方式是不同的，但有一点是相同的，那就是必须经过一些困难。完全没有困难，是不可能的。
    问题就在这里。经济作战已经获得初步胜利了，物价大体上已经稳定了，全国人民正为这一个伟大的胜利而欢欣庆祝。但，同时，困难也表现出来了，少数工商业因此而关门，若干从业员工因此而失业，那些关了门的工商业，有的是投机性的，有的虽然不曾投机，然而不是今天人民所需要的，有的甚至也是为人民所需要的。那就是说，困难表现在各方面。
    许多经济学者都已经告诉我们：通货由膨胀转入紧缩阶段的痛苦，更甚于膨胀时期。但，通货由膨胀到稳定，却必须经过一个紧缩的过程。因此这一种痛苦是不可免的。只有社会主义的苏联，才可能大量提高货币的价值，而不会感觉到丝毫痛苦。
    必须指出：这一种痛苦，政府机构和国营企业是同样受到的。管理现金使得许多国营企业的资金周转感到困难；紧缩编制更使得它们在进行工作和处理人事上大伤脑筋。但，这都是准备着的。共产党从来也不希望侥幸取胜——打没有牺牲的胜仗。因此，在三月三日颁布的《关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定》里面，就指出“宁愿忍受若干较小的困难，以便防止和避免更大的困难”。所以，人民政府这一次领导经济作战正和领导军事作战一样，忍受困难是自己带头的，而忍受目前一时的困难，正是为着大家未来的幸福。
    以上说明了今天的困难和痛苦，是敌人多年掠夺遗留下来的余毒，并不是人民政府制造出来的。长了十多年的脓胞，一旦开刀医治，一时的痛苦是会大一些，但要做一个健康的人，忍痛一时又无可避免。这是胜利中的痛苦，大家只能再接再厉的向前迈进，以取得最后的、更大的胜利。
    为什么在上海，这一个时期的痛苦会更大一些？那是因为上海是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的心脏地带，产业的畸形发展本来特别的厉害。加上敌人的封锁和轰炸，正针对着上海，痛苦自然就多一些。这正证明了，今天的痛苦是敌人给与我们的。
    尽管是敌人给与我们的痛苦，人民政府今天一面要从根救治，另一面还是要尽量设法减少痛苦。但减少痛苦并不靠打麻醉针，而是结合根本治疗，要使创伤早点复元。这就是毛主席在四月十四日的中央人民政府委员会第七次会议所说的：“今后几个月内，政府财经领导机关的工作重点，应当放在调整公营企业与私营企业以及公私企业各个部门的相互关系方面，极力克服无政府状态。”在同一个会议上，中央财经负责人陈云还报告：“政务院财经委员会准备在今后几个月内召开若干必要的会议，拟订若干必要的法令，并将重心放在调整工商业方面。中央人民政府成立以来的六个月中，政务院财经委员会的工作重心是放在财政方面，这是完全必要的，因而达到了平衡收支稳定物价的目的。”事情很明白，稳定物价是恢复经济的基础；先用全力平衡收支，稳定物价，再进一步调整工商业以求经济的恢复，步骤是十分合理而且正确的。
    这是中国从来不曾有过的新形势：国家统一、独立，财政收支接近平衡，物价稳定，政府又用大力来调整工商业，有计划的使国民经济由恢复逐渐进到发展。在这个新形势之下，私营工商业应该怎么办？
    我想，自己检讨一下吧！倘使自己的事业是投机性的，那在今天，没有转业的计划就只好早点关门。投机事业对于人民是有害无益的；它是脓胞里面的脓，是必须清除再加消毒，病才会好的。通货膨胀使得投机性的工商金融事业大大的发展起来。以上海而论，尽管战争使得经济衰落，通货膨胀却使得工商金融事业的单位数大大的增加。它们的存在完全脱离了人民的需要。既然它们过去是寄生在通货膨胀的基础上面，那末，这种企业今天随通货膨胀的消灭而消灭，还不是很自然而合理的吗？
    有些工商事业不一定带投机性，然而是从半封建半殖民地的社会基础上发展起来的。它们不为人民服务，而是为帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义服务的。今天，这三个人民的敌人倒下去了，它们失去了服务的对象。除非能够赶快的转移方向，改变为服务人民的事业，那末，淘汰也是免不了的。
    盲目的转业也是不行的。由投机转移到商业，或者由某种商业转移到另一种商业，甚至由商业转移到那些人民一时还不需要或需要没有那么多的工业，结果依然要失败的。很明显，商业是一般的过剩的。而工业生产是不能盲目的。究竟应该转移到什么行业，我们现在还不可能有各种正确的统计数字——过去的数字即使正确，今天也有些不适用了，因而一时也还不能有一个全盘的经济计划来具体规定私营工商业发展的种类与数量。但是，原则上却早已指出了。发展的方向就是“面对人民”和“面对农村”。也就是说，任何不是操纵国计民生而有益于国计民生的事业，都是工商业转业的目标与活动的范围。
    依我们的了解，目下购买力的低落是一时的。实际上，在通货膨胀停止以后，人民节省了极其巨大的通货贬值的损失，这种损失是应该可以转变为新的购买力的。但，由于过去是重物轻币，有了钱便拚命的抢购商品；今天变成了重币轻物，存商品的拚命要去换钱，这就使得商品的供给大量的相对的增加。北京有一间店铺张贴了“要钱不要货”的广告，正代表了一般人的心理。这种普遍的心理又使得消费人等待着看，延迟了购买。有些消费人过去也多存一点商品，现在有得用就不买。有的消费者甚至要把过多的消费品抛售出来。于是，市面便形成一时的供过于求的现象。实质上，这不过是购买力的延迟，而并不是购买力的减低。物价稳定了一个时期之后，延迟的购买力还是要重新发动起来的。
    物价是可以由下跌而归稳定的。政务院副总理陈云的报告已经告诉我们：“物价继续下降对于全国经济也是不利的，如果继续下降，政府当采适当步骤稳定之。”大家可以完全相信这一个启示，因为政府现在完全有力量控制市场，而共产党说话，是说得出就做得到的。消费人的观望时期一旦过去了，市场便可恢复。夏收以后会有一些进步；秋收只要能有平常的年成，可以有更多一些的进步。但，市场基本的好转还必须在战争完全胜利结束，土地改革使农民购买力基本提高之后。
    倘使大家认为上面的估计大致不差，那末，占绝大多数的正当经营而又为人民所需要的工商业，是应该可以坚定信心的。当然，业务方针的改变和组织方式、管理方法的改善，仍然是必要的。在业务方针上，除了必须面对人民，面对农村，切实的注意为工农阶级服务以外，还要诚心诚意的接受国营经济的领导。应该个别的、集体的去和领导的国营经济机关商谈，以谋公私经济配合起来共同努力生产、繁荣经济。组织上必须力求现代化，不能在事业机构里面建立封建关系。管理上必须完全肃清那种轻视职工的旧思想，要学会和劳方协商解决问题。这种积极精神和进步作风，使得事业转危为安，困难由大化小的例子，已经很多了。工商业家能在困难当中锻炼自己，力求进步，不但对事业有益，对今后自己做人也是有益的。等到困难过去，不合时宜的企业单位改造之后，不会再有不正当的投机和竞争，存留下来的工商业是一定可以得着发展的。
    今天人民政府里的人员，是没有人会像反动统治的官僚那样，以万能自居的。共产党所倡导的相信人民、与人民商量的作风就是今天政府人员的作风。所以，工商业家千万不能一味依靠政府指点出路，而应该是同业集合起来，共同讨论维持事业的具体办法。自己有了办法，再和政府商量，配合国营经济向前发展，那才是有效的。尤其是若干重要生产部门，必须赶快把现有的生产力，可能提高的生产力以及集体商定的生产计划准备好，以供今后几个月内政府召开若干必要会议的参考和讨论，这是工商业家的民主权利之一。只有这样的积极努力，公私兼顾才可能圆满实现。
    最后，我希望全国的工商业家不要听信匪特的谣言，坚决相信政府的政策。政治上正确的认识和对新国家坚决的信心，对于每一个工商业家应付当前的新形势都是有头等重要的作用的。我相信解放日子较长城市里的工商业家，应该已经在工作当中取得了这样的经验。
