　　Private Factory Workers Assist Capitalists in Maintaining Production
　  Labor and Management Sign Temporary Agreements
　　Hou Sheng Match Factory and Others Maintain Operations After Agreements Established
    [Reported by Our Newspaper's Correspondent Lin Hong] To help capitalists overcome current temporary difficulties and maintain production, workers and staff of private factories and shops in Beijing are signing temporary agreements with capitalists, voluntarily reducing wages, practicing strict economy, and improving product quality. They are also assisting capitalists in implementing the business policy of "small profits and quick turnover" and "serving the laboring people" in order to maintain production.

    Due to the current overproduction of matches, and the fact that the cost of matches produced by Hou Sheng Match Factory is higher than those in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, sales are sluggish, resulting in significant losses. To change this situation, the factory's workers are working hard to increase production in order to reduce costs. They also voluntarily signed a temporary agreement with the capitalists to reduce wages and economize. Workers voluntarily agreed to change the method of wage payment from being based on the retail price of Fudi millet to being calculated based on the price of millet for wages. This reduces the capitalist's expenditure by 1,300 catties of millet per month. Items such as firewood and shavings, which were previously allocated to workers by the capitalist without charge, are now purchased by the workers themselves. The clinic reduced one part-time doctor. The company's office in Tianjin was also closed. In return, the capitalist guarantees a sufficient supply of raw materials, adopts reasonable suggestions from the trade union, and ensures that wages are paid during periods of work stoppage due to lack of materials, unless there are special reasons. Since the signing of the temporary agreement, the cost and selling price of the factory's matches have been roughly balanced, allowing operations to be maintained.

    Jingwei Weaving Factory reached a temporary agreement through labor-management consultation meetings. From May, employee salaries will be reduced for two months, with workers' salaries reduced by approximately 19% to 27%, and staff salaries reduced by an average of 35%. Further adjustments will be made based on business conditions. Food and various welfare facilities provided by the factory to employees will be appropriately reduced or temporarily cancelled. Workers are also actively practicing economy and striving to improve product quality. The rate of substandard cloth has now been significantly reduced. For example, in April, the proportion of Grade A cloth in all products increased from 45% to 80%. Due to the concessions and efforts of the employees, the capitalist can reduce expenditure by more than 9,000 catties of millet per month, which not only reversed the loss-making situation but also generated considerable profit.

    The labor-management relations at Ruifuxiang Cloth Store are relatively normal. Last October, when the store's business was poor, employees voluntarily reduced wages and implemented cost-saving measures to help the capitalist overcome difficulties. After the Spring Festival this year, the store's business declined again, with daily sales averaging only 4 to 5 million yuan, which was not enough to cover expenses. Following the workers' suggestion, the capitalist changed the old business view and adopted a policy of small profits and quick turnover. In addition to selling off stocks of silk and wool, which were not needed by the general public, at 20% off, and selling remnants at 30% off, the profit margin on sales was also reduced. As a result, business gradually improved. In April, average daily sales exceeded 20 million yuan. The capitalist has not only paid off public bonds and taxes but also repaid 50 million yuan in bank loans, and the business is now profitable.

    Business at Tong He Ju Restaurant has been poor since liberation, and became even more sluggish in March this year, threatening to close down. The trade union mobilized workers to discuss the situation, and everyone agreed that in order to improve business, it was necessary to change the business policy and shift the focus from serving bureaucrats and compradors to serving the laboring people. The restaurant established a snack section, selling everything that the laboring people needed. Streamlining and saving measures were also implemented, such as setting standards for the amount of oil used for cooking various dishes in the kitchen and regulating the amount of paper used at the counter. The restaurant's business has now improved.

    De Yi Yuan Bathhouse was planning to close down at the end of last year due to poor business. After active consultation between labor and management and mediation by the Labor Bureau, the capitalist dispelled concerns and continued to invest in the business. The labor side voluntarily reduced wages and practiced strict economy. This allowed the bathhouse, which had already closed, to reopen in January of this year. According to the agreement, workers would not receive wages for the first half month after reopening, and wages would be restored after business improved. During periods of poor business, the capitalist would no longer provide food allowances to workers; half of the workers would rotate and return home to engage in production each month; the women's work unit would be temporarily suspended, and the livelihood of workers in that unit would be handled through consultation between both parties. However, after reopening, due to the workers' various cost-saving measures and their proactive efforts to contact various government agencies and organizations to sell collective bath tickets, business was sustainable, and the workers did not have to rotate and return home.

　　私营厂商工人协助资方维持生产
　  劳资签订临时协议           
　　厚生火柴厂等订立协议后均能维持营业
    【本报讯】记者林洪报道：京市私营工厂商店职工，为维持生产帮助资方渡过目前暂时困难，纷纷与资方订立临时协议，主动减低工资，厉行节约，提高产品质量；并协助资方实行“薄利多销”和“面向劳动人民”的营业方针，以维持生产。
    厚生火柴厂因目前火柴生产过剩，该厂所产火柴成本又高于津、沪等地，因此销路不畅，赔累甚巨。该厂工人为了改变这种情况，即努力提高产量，以便减低成本。并主动与资方订立了减资节约的临时协议。工人自愿将按伏地小米零售价格发放的工资，改成按工资米价计算。这样，每月可减少资方一千三百斤小米的开支。资方无价配给工人的劈柴、刨花等物，由工人出钱购买；医务室减少一位兼职医生。并撤消公司驻津办事处。资方则保证充分供给原料，采纳工会合理建议；在停工待料期间，如无特殊原因，工资照发。该厂自订立临时协议后，成本与售价已大体相敷，营业得以维持。
    经纬织布厂通过劳资协商会议订立了临时协议。职工薪资自五月份起降低两个月，工人约降低百分之十九到廿七，职员平均降低百分之三十五；以后视营业情况再行调整。厂方供给职工的伙食及各种福利设施，适当减少或暂时取消。工人并积极厉行节约，努力提高产品质量。该厂次布率现已显著减少。如四月份全部产品中，甲级布已由百分之四十五提高到百分之八十。由于职工此种让步与努力，资方每月可减少开支九千余斤小米，不但扭转了赔钱现象，且能获得相当利润。
    瑞蚨祥布店的劳资关系比较正常，去年十月该店营业不好，职工曾主动减低工资，实行节约，帮助资方渡过了困难。今年春节后，该店营业又趋不振，每天平均只售货四、五百万元，除去本钱不够开支。经工人建议后，资方改变了旧的营业观点，采取薄利多销的方针。除将绸缎呢绒等非广大人民需要的存货，按八折甩卖、零头料子按七折甩卖外，并减低了售货利润。这样营业日渐好转。四月份每日平均售货超过了二千万元。资方不但已交清公债税款，还清银行借款五千万元，且营业已有盈余。
    同和居饭庄的生意解放后就不好，今年三月营业更形清淡，眼看就要关门。工会发动工人讨论，大家认为要把营业搞好，必须改变经营方针，使过去服务于官僚、买办的饭店，转向劳动人民，该店成立了小吃部，凡是劳动人民需要的东西都卖。并实行精简节约，如将厨房炒各种菜需用的油量订出标准，柜上用纸规定数目等。该店营业现已好转。
    德颐园澡堂，去年年底因营业不好，资方打算歇业，后经劳方与资方主动协商并经劳动局调解后，资方解除了顾虑，继续投资经营；劳方则自愿减低工资、厉行节约。这样就使已停业的澡堂又重新于今年一月开张。按照协议，在恢复营业后半月，工人不要工资，等生意好转后再恢复工资。在营业不好的期间，原定由资方供给工人的伙食，不发菜金；工人中的一半每月轮流回家生产；女工部暂停工作，该部工人生活由双方协商处理。但开张后，因工人多方节约，并主动与各机关团体接洽出售集体澡票，因而买卖可以维持，工人也就没有轮流回家。
