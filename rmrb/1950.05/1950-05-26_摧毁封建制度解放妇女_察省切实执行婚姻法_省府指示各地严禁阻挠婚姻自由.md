　　【Zhangjiakou News】According to the Chahar Daily, the judicial organs in various counties and cities of Chahar Province have resolved more than 8,000 marriage cases in a little over a year of incomplete statistics, liberating many women from feudal oppression. The feudal marriage system has begun to be destroyed. However, the marriage policy has not been well implemented in many places. The main reason is that many cadres still have incorrect ideas left over from feudal society, mistakenly believing that "freedom of marriage is only beneficial to women." Some delay dealing with women's requests for divorce; others force women to continue living a life of suffering; some cadres uncritically cater to the backward consciousness of the masses, unreasonably obstructing the correct love affairs of young men and women; and a small number of judicial cadres do not handle marriage cases according to policy principles but listen to the incorrect opinions of district and village cadres. For example, a woman in Yangmenbao Village, Wanquan County, was originally betrothed to a younger brother, but was later forced to marry his older brother. She did not want to and asked for a divorce. The cadres in the village reflected: "If she is allowed to divorce, forty or fifty women in the whole village will also want to divorce." This frightened the county and district leaders, who feared causing a "divorce wave," and they did not approve her divorce. Conversely, some cadres are not cautious in handling marriage issues and approve divorces as soon as they are mentioned. These phenomena have hindered the freedom of marriage for men and women, especially hindering the liberation of women. Because marriage problems are not resolved appropriately or in a timely manner, many women have committed suicide. According to incomplete statistics from last year, out of 219 suicide cases, 51 were due to marriage problems.

　　The Chahar Provincial People's Government recently issued instructions on earnestly implementing the Marriage Law. First, it requires cadres in all regions to clarify their thinking, thoroughly eliminate the remnants of feudal ideology, correctly understand the basic principles of the Marriage Law, and implement genuine freedom of marriage, including freedom to marry and divorce. It also strictly prohibits cadres from obstructing freedom of marriage, and those who violate the Marriage Law will be punished for dereliction of duty. Second, the provincial government instructed that all regions should use people's schools, representative meetings, and various mass gatherings to widely publicize the Marriage Law and the policy of freedom of marriage. It also requires the judicial departments of all counties and cities to go to the countryside in a planned way to resolve marriage disputes.

　　摧毁封建制度解放妇女
    察省切实执行婚姻法       
    省府指示各地严禁阻挠婚姻自由
    【张家口讯】察哈尔日报消息：根据一年多时间的不完全统计，察哈尔省各县、市的司法机关一共解决了婚姻案八千多件，解除了很多妇女所受的封建压迫。封建的婚姻制度已经开始被摧毁。但是，婚姻政策在许多地方还没有很好贯彻下去。主要原因是许多干部还有封建社会里遗留下来的不正确的思想，错误地认为“婚姻自由只对妇女有利”。有的对妇女提出的离婚要求拖延不理；有的还强迫妇女继续过着痛苦生活；有的干部无原则地迁就群众的落后意识，无理地阻挠青年男女的正确恋爱；还有少数司法干部不根据政策原则处理婚姻案件，却听信区村干部不正确的意见。例如万全县扬门堡一位妇女，原是给弟弟说的亲，后来却被迫和他的哥哥结了婚。她不愿意，要求离婚。本村的干部就反映：“准她离婚，全村有四五十个妇女也都要离婚。”这一下把县区领导干部吓唬住了，怕造成“离婚热潮”，便不批准她离婚。相反地，也有一些干部处理婚姻问题不慎重，一提离婚就批准。这些现象，都妨害了男女婚姻自由，特别是阻碍了妇女的解放。因为婚姻问题解决得不适当或不及时，造成了不少的妇女自杀事件。根据去年的不完全统计，在二百一十九件自杀案里面，就有五十一件是因为婚姻问题而自杀的。
    察哈尔省人民政府最近发出关于切实执行婚姻法的指示。首先要求各地干部搞通思想，彻底肃清封建思想的残余，正确地认识婚姻法的基本原则，实行结婚、离婚真正自由的婚姻自由。并且严禁干部阻挠婚姻自由，违犯婚姻法的要以渎职论处。其次，省府指示，要求各地利用民校、代表会和各种群众集会，广泛宣传婚姻法和婚姻自由政策。并要求各县、市司法部门有计划地下乡解决婚姻纠纷。
