　　Northwest Steel Company's Kiln Factory Sets New Record for Reducing Defectives
　　Xishan Mining Area Corrects Mistakes of Blind Exploration
    [Reported by our Taiyuan correspondent] Workers at the Northwest Steel Company's Kiln Factory have created a new record in firing sand bricks, with a damage rate of only 0.3%. Before liberation, the damage rate per kiln in this factory was often 15% to 20%, and the quality was poor. After liberation, the damage rate was reduced to 6% or 7%. In February of this year, the factory burned four kilns of sand bricks, and the average damage rate rose again to 20%. After this happened, the factory leaders and workers all made self-criticisms. Everyone agreed that the main reason for the serious waste was the eagerness to complete tasks and failure to follow operating procedures. After the self-criticism, kiln foreman Shi Lianzu studied with the workers and decided that in the future firing process, they would extend the smoking and cooling time of the kiln, control the temperature, adjust ventilation regularly, adjust fuel and increase the temperature according to the temperature curve chart, and implement a shift responsibility system. After accepting the task of firing Kiln No. 8, Shi Lianzu worked day and night with the workers to study the work, and the workers also operated diligently and carefully, resulting in a new record for reducing the damage rate.
    After the new record appeared, the Northwest Steel Company immediately gave material rewards to those who contributed, and imposed appropriate penalties for the loss of the four kilns of sand bricks burned in the past, to ensure clear rewards and punishments. This encouraged everyone's production enthusiasm.
    [Another dispatch] The leading cadres of the Xishan Mining Area of the Mining Department of the Northwest Steel Company once had a fairly serious bureaucratic style, lacking the idea of relying on the working class and cherishing public property, resulting in blind exploration, foreman embezzlement, and chaotic accounting and warehousing, which led to lax discipline and caused serious losses to state property. For example, the Ximing Work Department under the jurisdiction of the mining area did not establish a scientific exploration system. Some foremen sent workers to mine randomly all over the mountains, neither asking for instructions from superiors nor discussing with technicians or experienced veteran workers. From July to October last year, they opened 60 mine holes in Dayaozui, but only two holes produced ore. The Jinyuan Work Department mined 476.8 tons of ore, but because the ore quality was not good, it wasted more than 99,000 catties of millet. In the process of mining, the work department had requested instructions from the mining area, but the person in charge of the mining area did not pay attention to it until the company refused to accept the ore, and then the mining was stopped. These shortcomings were discovered in the general inspection movement in December last year. The responsible parties who were derelict in their duties were given appropriate punishments. The mine also accepted past experiences and lessons, and formulated and issued exploration systems, strict accounting systems, personnel systems, summary reporting systems, etc. Various tasks have made progress compared to before.

### 西北钢铁公司窑厂创降低废品新纪录　西山采矿所纠正盲目试探错误

　　西北钢铁公司窑厂创降低废品新纪录
　　西山采矿所纠正盲目试探错误
    【本报太原讯】西北钢铁公司窑厂工人，创造了烧制砂砖损坏率仅达千分之三的新纪录。解放前，该厂每窑损坏率经常是百分之二十至十五，且质量粗糙。解放以后，损坏率即减少到百分之六、七。本年二月份，该厂烧坏了四窑砂砖，平均损坏率又升为百分之二十。此事发生后，该厂领导人、工友们都作了检讨，大家一致认为：急于完成任务，不按操作法工作，是发生严重浪费现象的主要原因。经过检讨以后，烧成工长史联族便和工友们一起研究，确定在今后烧成过程中，要延长熏窑和冷却时间，把握温度，定时调节通风，根据温度曲线表调节燃料和增高温度，并实行接班负责制度。他们在接受烧成八号窑的任务后，史联族昼夜不停的和工友在一起研究工作，工友们也紧张细心的操作，结果创造了降低损坏率的新纪录。
    新纪录出现后，西北钢铁公司立即发给有功者以实物奖励，对以往烧坏四窑砂砖的损失，则有适当处罚，作到赏罚严明。鼓励大家的生产情绪。
    【又讯】西北钢铁公司矿业部西山采矿所的领导干部，曾经存在着相当严重的官僚主义作风，缺乏依靠工人阶级的思想和爱护公共财产的观念，造成盲目试探、监工贪污、会计及仓库混乱等纪律松弛现象，使国家财富遭受到严重损失。例如该采矿所所辖西铭工作部，没有建立科学的试探制度，有些监工派工人满山乱采，既不向上级请示报告，又不和技术人员或素有经验的老工友研究，自去年七月至十月，在大窑嘴开了六十个矿洞，结果只有两洞出矿。晋源工作部开采了矿石四七六点八吨，因为矿石品质不好，虚耗小米九万九千余斤。在开采过程中，工作部虽曾请示采矿所，但该所负责人竟未予重视，直至公司拒绝接受矿石时，才停止开采。这些缺点，都在去年十二月大检查运动中发现了。各失职当事人分别受到适当的处分，该矿也接受过去的经验教训，制订颁发了试探制度，严格会计制度，人事制度，总结汇报等制度。各种工作，较以前已有进步。
