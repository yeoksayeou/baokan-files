　　Demonstrate Against the War Mongers!
    Excerpts from Peace Signature Letters Received by This Newspaper
    The comrades from the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Langfang Business Office and Langfang Machine Station wrote in their signature letter sent to this newspaper: "We studied relevant documents and had in-depth discussions before signing. We know that signing is not seeking peace, but demonstrating against the war-mongers!"
    A group of soldiers engaged in production added a note on the signature book: "Although we have laid down our guns and picked up hoes, we have never forgotten that the imperialists are not reconciled to defeat. If any imperialist dares to invade, we will definitely take up arms and break their dog legs."
    Mr. Chen Rangzhi, a military dependent, and his wife, Peng Boying, said: "I am a military dependent, 65 years old this year. Two sons and one daughter have long participated in the revolution. Now that the territory is about to be completely liberated and the foundation for national construction has been laid, the people are about to live a few peaceful years. If anyone dares to launch a war of aggression and destroy the people with atomic weapons, although I am old, I will definitely order my children to take up arms and resolutely defend world peace."
    All 643 faculty, staff, and students of Hebei Provincial Zhengding Middle School signed their names and said, "We will use practical actions to publicize to the people to express our determination to defend peace and oppose wars of aggression."
    Ten comrades from the Northeast Yimianpo Railway Workers' Second Sanatorium wrote in their peace signature letter sent to this newspaper: "We are all patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. We want to recuperate peacefully, strive to recover our health as soon as possible, return to the production front, and use practical actions to support world peace and combat the imperialists' conspiracy of aggressive war."
    When the Jingtai Industrial Cooperative's worker reading group launched the peace signature campaign, an old woman, Jiao, asked: Is there a mobile signature station that goes to homes so that old gentlemen and old ladies who cannot walk or go out have the opportunity to participate in the signing?
    The pupils of Yangshi Street National Elementary School in the Fourth District of Beijing said: "We are the new children of New China. We are now living a free and happy life, but there are still some people in the world who are living a painful life under imperialist oppression, and the war-mongers are shamelessly clamoring for war, trying to eliminate mankind. We hate them, we need world peace. Come on, let us all actively sign and support this great movement to defend world peace!"
    Pang Xiangyu, a farmer from Beixiashu Village, Wanxian County, immediately convened a family meeting after seeing this newspaper's call for peace signature letters. The eight members of his family fully agreed to sign. He made a special trip to Beijing to sign. After arriving in Beijing, he learned that he could also sign by mail, so he sent a letter back home, asking his mother, wife, and two older children (Youth League members), and a seven-year-old daughter to send their signatures.
    All comrades of the Xuzhou People's Broadcasting Station wrote: "For the survival of the people all over the world, we swear: We are willing to donate our lives to fight for the cause of defending world peace."
    All the Young Pioneers of Henfa Town Complete Primary School in the Fourth District of Daxing County, Hebei Province, signed their names, and mobilized all the students in the school to sign and publicize the significance of the peace signature movement to the masses. (May 22)
