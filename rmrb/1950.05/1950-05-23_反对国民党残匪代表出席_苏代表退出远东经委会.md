　　Opposing the Presence of Remnant Kuomintang Bandit Representatives
    Soviet Representative Withdraws from the Far East Economic Commission
    [Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, May 22nd] TASS, Delhi, May 21st: The sixth session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East was held in Bangkok. The Soviet representative proposed to expel the representatives of the remnant Kuomintang government from the committee and to recognize the representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as the legitimate Chinese representatives. The Soviet representative pointed out that as long as the Kuomintang representatives remained on the committee, the Soviet representative would not participate in the work of the committee, and the Soviet government would not recognize the resolutions made without its participation as legitimate decisions. The Soviet representative's proposal was seconded by the representatives of India and Burma. The Siamese representative proposed that the Soviet proposal be submitted to a higher-level United Nations body for a decision. This suggestion by the Siamese representative was passed by a majority vote of the committee due to the insistence of the representatives of the colonial powers—the United States, France, and the Netherlands. The representatives of the Soviet Union, Burma, and India voted against it. The representatives of Britain and Pakistan abstained. Because the Soviet proposal was not adopted, the Soviet representative immediately left the meeting.

　　反对国民党残匪代表出席
    苏代表退出远东经委会
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社德里二十一日讯：联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会第六届会议在曼谷召开。苏联代表提议自委员会中开除国民党残余政府的代表，并承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表为合法的中国代表。苏联代表指出，只要国民党代表还留在委员会中，苏联代表就不参加委员会的工作，而且苏联政府将不承认在没有它参加时所作的决议为合法的决定。苏联代表的提议得到了印度及缅甸代表们的附议。暹罗代表提出将苏联的提案送交较高级的联合国机构去决定。暹罗代表的这个建议，由于殖民国家——美、法、荷——代表们的坚持，获得委员会的多数票通过。苏联、缅甸及印度代表们投票反对。英国及巴基斯坦的代表们弃权。由于苏联的议案未被采纳，苏联代表随即离开该会会场。
