　　MacArthur's Parrot
    New Era Article Exposes Slanders of Japanese Officials
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 2nd] TASS, Moscow, May 2nd: The latest issue of the "New Era" magazine, in its "Exposing Slanders" column, published an article entitled "MacArthur's Parrot," ridiculing the fabrications and slanders made by American and Japanese officials regarding the issue of the Soviet Union repatriating Japanese prisoners of war. The magazine stated: "Playing tricks with a set of numbers plucked from the sky, MacArthur's Japanese running dogs, with a stroke of the pen, 'dispatch' tens or even hundreds of thousands of Japanese officers and soldiers who had long since died in China or other places on the Pacific islands to Siberia, and then demand that they be sent back." MacArthur's headquarters is currently issuing new demands for the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war, using estimates obtained from the Japanese side regarding the number of "those who have not yet been repatriated" as a reference. The Japanese parrots also cite the same fabricated "estimates," but this time they say that MacArthur's headquarters is the source of the information. "New Era" pointed out: "The ulterior motive of this movement is to stir up public opinion in Japan and arouse animosity towards the Soviet Union. These clumsy plots have long been fully exposed. As early as May 20, 1949, the representative of the Soviet Council of Ministers responsible for prisoner repatriation affairs announced that the vast majority of Japanese prisoners of war had been repatriated from the Soviet Union to Japan. The TASS statement published on April 22 this year, 'Completion of the Soviet Union's Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners of War,' is a fatal blow to all slanderous fabrications. But MacArthur's headquarters and Japanese running dogs are unwilling to give up their tricks of incitement. So the official spokesperson of the headquarters stated that, in his view, the Soviet Union 'still holds' 309,070 Japanese people. Anti-Soviet cries are erupting again. The Yomiuri Shimbun published insane nonsense about so-called Japanese prisoner of war 'ghost camps' being organized in the Soviet Union, and the Japanese House of Councillors' Repatriation Committee even launched a new 'investigation.' At the instigation of Sebald, MacArthur's representative on the Allied Council for Japan, a provocative 'case' of persecuting Tokuda Kyuichi, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, was fabricated, falsely accusing him of delaying the repatriation of prisoners of war. The House of Representatives' Examination Committee even began 'investigating' the activities of the Japanese Communist Party on this matter on March 28." "New Era" concluded by saying: "MacArthur is probably very satisfied with his Japanese assistants, because they zealously follow his every anti-Soviet conspiracy. But the enthusiasm they show does not stem from wisdom, but fully reflects the sinister and provocative nature of the machinations carried out by the US occupation headquarters in Japan."

　　麦克阿瑟的鹦鹉
    新时代撰文揭穿日本官员的诽谤
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：最近一期的新时代杂志在《揭穿诽谤》一栏内，以《麦克阿瑟的鹦鹉》为题，撰文嘲笑美国及日本官员关于自苏联遣送日本战俘问题所作的诽谤的捏造。该杂志称：变着一套从天上拿来的数字的戏法，麦克阿瑟将军的日本走狗们，用大笔一挥，把那些早在战争中死于中国或太平洋各岛其他地方的数万甚至数十万的日本官兵“派遣”到西伯利亚去，于是再要求把他们送回来。麦克阿瑟总部目前正以从日本方面所得到的关于“那些还未遣回”的数目估计作为参考，发出遣回日本战俘新要求的叫嚣。日本的鹦鹉们也引证同一伪造的“估计”，但这一次又说麦克阿瑟总部是情报的来源了。新时代指出：这一运动的暗中目的，是要在日本国内剌激舆论，并引起对苏联的反感。这些蠢笨的阴谋早就被充分地暴露了。早在一九四九年五月二十日，负责遣俘事务的苏联部长会议的代表就已经宣布，绝大多数的日本战俘已自苏联遣往日本。今年四月二十二日塔斯社所发表的“关于苏联遣送日本战俘完毕”的声明，对于一切诽谤的捏造是一个致命的打击。但麦克阿瑟总部与日本走狗们不愿意放弃他们挑拨的伎俩。于是总部的正式发言人就表示，在他看来，苏联“仍然扣留”了三十万九千零七十个日本人。反苏的叫喊又在爆发。读卖新闻上出现了所谓在苏联组有某种日本战俘“鬼营”的癫狂的胡说，并且日本参院遣俘委员会还发动了新的“调查”。由于盟国对日管制委员会麦克阿瑟的代表赛鲍尔的怂恿，于是制造了迫害日本共产党总书记德田球一的挑拨性的“案件”，硬说他是犯有使遣俘迟延的罪行，而众院的考查委员会还于三月二十八日开始就这件事情“调查”日本共产党的活动。新时代在结语时说：麦克阿瑟对于他的日本助手们大约很满意，因为他们热心地追随着他的每一个反苏的阴谋。但他们所表现的这种热情并不是出于智慧，而是完全表现了美国驻日占领军总部所进行的勾当的罪恶而挑拨的性质。
