　　Launch Revolutionary New Heroism Movement
　  Southwest Military Region Universally Holds Commendation Meetings
    【Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th】 In order to launch the revolutionary new heroism movement, commend models in various work positions during the campaign to advance into the Southwest, and encourage all commanders and fighters to bravely and happily meet the new situation and new combat tasks, the People's Liberation Army Southwest Military Region held commendation meetings in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Kang areas from the end of last year to March and April of this year. The commendation meetings of various units demonstrated that due to the leadership of the Communist Party and the heroic models leading the broad masses of commanders and fighters to fight bravely and strictly implement policies, discipline, and mass discipline, our army was able to smoothly complete the task of advancing into the Southwest with the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people, and achieved great and brilliant results. During the advance into the Southwest, a certain army captured more than 60,000 enemy soldiers and prompted more than 20,000 Kuomintang troops to revolt. The number of casualties in the entire army was less than two percent. A certain division of this army created model units such as the advanced company for consolidating the troops, the advanced company for combat merits, and the advanced company for policies and discipline.
    The Logistics Department of the Southwest Military Region, despite the difficulty of transportation, successfully completed the rapid advancement over long distances, effectively guaranteeing the enormous needs of the front line. The total number of people who received merits in the department reached 2,068. Sun Peiying, who was invited to participate in the first Chengdu Municipal People's Representative Conference, won the title of People's Hero for his actions from southern Shaanxi to Sichuan. With a force of only one and a half platoons, he penetrated deeply into the flank of the bandit army in Guangyuan over a long distance, wiped out an enemy battalion, and assisted fraternal troops in capturing Guangyuan. Yang Guizhen, single-handedly and with one gun, completed the task of escorting 72 barrels of gasoline from Qiqihar to Zhengzhou over a distance of 7,000 li. During the 13-day escort journey, he wholeheartedly guarded the train carrying gasoline day and night, and finally brought all the gasoline safely to Zhengzhou. Moreover, he was thrifty and public-spirited, spending only 5,000 yuan on food in 13 days. The government gave him 6,000 yuan, and he returned the remaining 1,000 yuan to the food unit.

　　开展革命新英雄主义运动
　  西南军区普遍开会庆功
    【新华社重庆九日电】人民解放军西南军区为着开展革命的新英雄主义运动，表扬进军大西南作战中各个工作岗位上的模范，激励全军指战员勇敢愉快地迎接新的形势和新的战斗任务，曾于去年底至今春三四月间分别在川、滇、黔、康驻地召开贺功大会。各部的贺功大会说明了由于共产党的领导和英雄模范带领广大指战员勇敢战斗，严格执行政策纪律和群众纪律，因此，我军能在广大人民热烈的支援下顺利地完成进军西南的任务，并获得了伟大而辉煌的战绩。某军在西南进军中全军俘敌六万余人，促使国民党军队二万余人起义，全军伤亡减员数字不足百分之二。该军某师曾创造了巩固部队优胜营、战功优胜营、政策纪律优胜营等模范单位。
    西南军区后勤部在交通工具困难的情况下，胜利地完成了长距离的迅速推进，有力地保证了前线的浩繁需要。该部立功总人数达二千零六十八人。应邀参加成都市第一届各界人民代表会议的孙培英，在由陕南入川中荣获人民功臣的称号。他以一个半班的兵力长距离地猛插入广元匪军侧翼阵地，歼敌一个营，协助兄弟部队攻占了广元。杨贵珍单人独枪完成了从齐齐哈尔到郑州七千里押运七十二桶汽油的任务。十三天的押运旅程中，他白天黑夜全心全意地看守着放着汽油的列车，终于把所有的汽油安全带到了郑州。而且他节俭奉公，十三天只化了五千元伙食钱，公家给他六千元还剩下一千元交给了伙食单位。
