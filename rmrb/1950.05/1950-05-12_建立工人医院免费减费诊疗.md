　　Establishing Workers' Hospitals for Free and Reduced-Fee Medical Treatment

　　[Report from this newspaper] The public health work in Beijing has clearly moved towards serving the laboring people, and has already yielded considerable results. In the past, most of Beijing's public and private hospitals were located in the most prosperous areas, exhibiting a deformed and bloated presence in the triangular area of the old Districts 1, 7, and the southern part of District 3. However, in the old Districts 4, 5, 10, and 11, where the laboring people were concentrated, especially in the suburbs, they were as scarce as morning stars. According to the resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference of all circles, the Municipal Public Health Bureau established a workers' hospital in the old District 5 in January, dedicated to treating workers, workers' families, and poor citizens. Workers are exempt from outpatient registration fees, and those who are genuinely poor are given reduced or free medical expenses. In February and March, the Public Health Bureau organized more than 190 obstetricians and midwives citywide to establish a maternal and child healthcare network, providing free or semi-free delivery services to poor pregnant women based on actual circumstances. At the end of April, a maternal and child healthcare center was established in the old District 10 to provide prenatal check-ups, delivery services, and postpartum prevention and treatment for the vast number of working women. In the future, it is planned to establish three workers' clinics in other districts with few hospitals. One health affairs office will be set up in the old District 4 and Fengtai respectively. Furthermore, due to the limited strength of municipal medical institutions, it is also planned to adopt methods such as entrusting, cooperation, or designation to enable other public and private health and medical institutions to provide free or reduced-fee diagnosis and treatment for poor laborers and patients with acute illnesses, with the government providing appropriate subsidies for medical expenses. It is estimated that when these plans are completed, the whole year can accommodate 2,500 poor laborers who are unable to pay medical expenses for free hospitalization, and 392,400 people for reduced or free outpatient fees.

　　建立工人医院免费减费诊疗
    【本报讯】京市公共医疗卫生工作，已明确地迈向为劳动人民服务的方向，并已收到不少成果。过去，京市的公私立医院多半开设在最繁华的地区，在旧一区、七区和三区南部的三角地带，表现了畸形臃肿。而在劳动人民密集的旧四、五、十、十一等区，尤其是郊区，却寥若晨星。根据各界人民代表会议的决议，市公共卫生局已于一月份在旧五区建立了一个工人医院，专为工人、工人家属和贫苦市民治病。工人免收门诊挂号费，对确实贫苦的则减收或免收医药费。在二、三月间，公共卫生局又组织了全市一百九十余产科医生和助产士，建立了妇幼保健工作网，根据实际情况，免费或半免费为贫苦产妇接生；四月底又在旧十区建立了一处妇幼保健所，为广大劳动妇女产前检查，接生和产后防治。今后并准备在其他医院特少的区建立三个工人诊疗所。在旧四区和丰台分别各设一个卫生事务所。又因市立医疗机构力量有限，还拟采取委托、合作或指定的方式，使其他公私立卫生医疗机关，为贫苦劳动人民、急病患者，免费或减费诊治，政府酌予补助医药费。估计在这些计划都完成时，全年可容纳二千五百名贫苦无力缴纳医药费的劳动人民免费住院，和三十九万二千四百人减免门诊费。
