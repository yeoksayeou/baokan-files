　　Guye Locomotive Depot No. 1814 Locomotive
　　Safely Travels 100,000 Kilometers
    Zhangjiakou and Datong Both Set New Records for Safe Travel
    [Our Newspaper, Guye] The MC—1814 locomotive crewed by Fu Ruzhou of the Guye Locomotive Depot of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, after submitting a guarantee for safe driving on May 13th of last year, has safely traveled 100,000 kilometers by April 7th of this year, exceeding two Class A inspection periods, driving 500 kilometers per day, and increasing the traction weight to 2,000 tons.
    The crew members regard this locomotive as their own home, cleaning and repairing it all day long. They established labor discipline and regulations, stipulating that when the locomotive enters the depot, all three shifts must carefully complete handover procedures. The entire team cooperatively inspects the locomotive's condition. When on duty, they ensure signal confirmation, strictly practice call and response, closely monitor steam pressure, water level, and track conditions, and prevent train jolts. The crew members learned repair techniques from renovation workers and took on Class B and C inspections themselves, saving the country 1,200 work hours. In regular review meetings, they frequently studied past cases and determined methods to prevent accidents.
    On October 11th of last year, when the locomotive was pulling the Beijing-Shenyang express train No. 2, between Lutai and Hangu, the right trailing wheel spring was broken due to soft roadbed and locomotive jolting. The assistant driver, Liu Hetang, braved the danger and, in the dark while the train was moving, used wooden blocks to prop up the front of the trailing wheel, allowing the locomotive to continue moving forward. Subsequently, discovering that the trailing axle was continuously overheating, he climbed from the water pump suction pipe to the wheel rim to lubricate it, ensuring the train arrived in Tianjin on time and safely.
    The 100,000 kilometers of safe travel was completed through the arduous study and heroic labor of the workers. The crew members accepted the experience of group unity, humbly learning techniques, and establishing contact contracts with maintenance personnel, and have developed a plan to move towards the 200,000 kilometer goal! (Li Han, Wang Dequan)
    [Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou] Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot locomotive Wen XI 6-1585 has safely traveled 79,009.5 kilometers, exceeding one Class A inspection period. Saving the People's Railway more than 16,000 jin of millet. After the locomotive won an award at the Zhangjiakou "May Day" commemoration meeting, it resolved to exceed another Class A inspection period and complete the task of 130,000 kilometers of safe travel.

    [Our Newspaper, Datong] In order to eliminate accidents and ensure safe driving, the Datong Transportation Section launched a 150,000-kilometer accident-free movement on January 27th. After 72 days of arduous struggle, overcoming difficulties such as insufficient equipment and severe cold weather, they successfully completed the safe operation task on April 8th. Ma Shen, Yao Hanqing, and 26 other transport conductors were awarded the title of collective model at the Datong City "May Day" award meeting and received a banner with the inscription "Safe Operation of 150,000 Kilometers."

　　古冶机务段一八一四号机车
　　安全走行十万公里     
    张家口大同皆创安全行走新纪录
    【本报古冶讯】天津铁路局古冶机务段ㄇㄘ—一八一四号机车傅汝舟包乘组，自去年五月十三日提出安全行车的保证后，至今年四月七日，已安全走行十万公里，超过两个甲检期每日行车五百公里，牵引量增至二千吨。
    该车乘务员把这台机车看成自己的家一样，整天擦车、修理。他们订立了劳动纪律和制度，规定机车入库时，三班必须详细办理交待手续。由全组协同检查机车状态。值乘时保证确认信号，厉行呼唤应答，密切注意汽压水位及线路状态，不使列车冲动。乘务员向装修工人学习了修车技术，自己担任乙、丙检，给国家节省了一千二百工时。在定期检讨会中，经常研究实例，定出防止事故的办法。
    去年十月十一日，该机车拖引京沈二次快车，行至芦台汉沽间，因路基松软，机车起浮受震，将右侧从轮弹簧折损。副司机刘贺堂冒着危险，在黑夜车急行时，用木块将从轮前侧垫起，使机车继续前进。继又发现从轴不断发热，他又由水泵吸水管爬到轮围铁上去给油，使列车正点安全到达天津。
    十万公里安全走行是在工友艰苦学习、英勇劳动中完成的。该车乘务员接受了小组团结、虚心学习技术，与检修人员订立联系合同的经验，又订出计划，向二十万公里目标迈进！        （李汉、王德全）
    【本报张家口讯】张家口机务段攵ㄒ６一五八五号机车安全走行七万九千零九·五公里，超过一个甲检期。给人民铁路节省一万六千多斤小米。该机车在张家口“五一”纪念大会上获奖后，决心再超过一个甲检期，完成十三万公里安全走行的任务。
