　　War-peddler Acheson Reviled Everywhere
　　London Women Shout "Go Home"
　　French People Rally to Protest Acheson's Arrival in Paris
Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Tass, London, 10th: A group of British mothers, some holding infants, visited the American Embassy in London to deliver letters demanding peace to the American Secretary of State Acheson. At the crossroads leading to the embassy, the police attempted to block them. However, the women protested, "This is not Hitler's Germany, no one can stop us from passing through our own streets!" They finally reached the gate of the embassy. Subsequently, the police only allowed one representative to enter the embassy, who handed over letters from mothers in various districts of London—Lewisham, East Ham, Hampstead, and mothers from the Finsbury clothing factory—to the American security official.
　　At this time, the waiting women outside unfurled flags and placards, which read: "We are not raising sons for slaughter," "Americans in Britain equal bombs in Britain," "Atomic weapons mean war, ban the atomic bomb." The police snatched the placards and destroyed them, but the women continued to shout: "We want peace!" "American bombers go home!"
Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Tass, Moscow: Pravda published on the 9th in a prominent position Zhukov's Paris dispatch stating that Acheson's trip to France has stirred up the broadest sections of the French people. Acheson had just arrived in Paris, and he could immediately see for himself what the true sentiments of the French citizens were: on the streets he was to pass through, people wrote on the walls of houses at night such phrases as: "Mr. Acheson, go back! We don't want to see you!" "Down with the American war-mongers!" "Whoever uses the atomic bomb first is a war criminal!" According to the "Zhendan Daily", Acheson took many detours, winding through streets where police were stationed every fifty meters. Hitler's ministers also used roughly the same method when passing through Paris under their occupation.
　　In response to the call of the National Standing Committee of the "Fighters for Peace and Freedom" Association, all members of the local committees for the defense of peace have been working non-stop these days, enabling the vast number of people to continuously sign the appeal for the prohibition of atomic weapons called for by the Stockholm Conference of the Great Standing Committee. According to incomplete estimates, on May 7th and 8th alone, more than 50,000 people in the Paris area signed the appeal. Meetings are being held everywhere to protest Acheson's arrival in Paris. Zhukov wrote about his visit to the National Standing Committee of the "Fighters for Peace and Freedom" Association. This is a center where packages of signature books printed with the Stockholm Appeal for the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons and resolutions protesting Acheson's arrival in Paris are constantly being collected from all parts of Paris, and letters and telegrams from all over the country are also being sent here.

　　战贩艾奇逊到处受唾骂
　　伦敦妇女高呼“滚回去”   
    法国人民集会抗议艾奇逊到巴黎
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社伦敦十日讯：一群英国的母亲们，其中有的还抱着婴孩，趋访伦敦美国大使馆，把要求和平的信件交给美国国务卿艾奇逊。在通往大使馆的十字路口，警察曾企图拦阻她们。但是，妇女们抗议说：“这不是希特勒德国，谁也不能阻止我们通过我们自己的街道！”她们终于到达了大使馆的门口。随后，警察便只准许一名代表进入大使馆，这位代表就把伦敦各区——路易斯哈姆、东哈姆、哈姆普斯特德的母亲们和芬斯伯雷被服工厂的母亲们的信件，交给了美国的保安官员。
    这时，在外边等待的妇女们打开了旗帜和标语牌，上面写的是：“我们不是为屠杀而养儿子的”、“美国佬来英国等于炸弹落在英国”、“原子武器意味着战争，禁止原子弹”。警察夺去标语牌，并把它们毁坏，然而，妇女们仍然大声疾呼：“我们要和平！”，“美国佬的轰炸机滚回去！”
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于九日在显著地位刊登朱可夫的巴黎通讯称：艾奇逊的法国之行，使法国最广大的各界人民都激动起来了。艾奇逊刚刚抵达巴黎，他便马上可以亲眼看到法国公民的真正情绪是怎样的：在那些他要路经的市街上，晚间有人在房屋的墙壁上写着这样的字句：“艾奇逊先生，回去！我们不要看到你！”“打倒美国战争贩子！”“谁首先使用原子弹谁就是战犯！”据震旦报说，艾奇逊拐了许多弯子迂回穿过那些每隔五十公尺就设有警察的街道。而希特勒的部长们走过他们占领下的巴黎时，也是采用过与此大致相同的方法的。
    为了响应“争和平自由战士”协会全国常设委员会的号召，各地方拥护和平委员会的全体委员，这些天来一直不停地工作着，使广大人民源源不断地在和大常委会斯德哥尔摩会议号召禁止原子武器的呼吁书上签名。据不完全的估计，在五月七日和八日内，仅仅巴黎区就有五万人以上在呼吁书上签了名。到处都在举行会议，抗议艾奇逊抵达巴黎。朱可夫写到他访问“争和平自由战士”协会全国常设委员会的情形。这是一个中心，成包印上禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩呼吁书的签名册和抗议艾奇逊抵巴黎的决议书，源源不断地从巴黎各地汇集到这里来，全国各地的信件与电报也纷纷寄到这里来。（附图片）
