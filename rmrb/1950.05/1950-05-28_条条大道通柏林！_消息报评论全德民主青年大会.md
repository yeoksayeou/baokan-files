　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th: TASS reports: The News (Izvestia) published on the 26th a dispatch from its reporter Priyanov from Berlin, discussing the upcoming All-German Democratic Youth Assembly.

　　Priyanov, after quoting a German newspaper saying, "Now all roads in Germany lead to Berlin," wrote: This is really not an exaggeration. Hundreds of thousands of young men and women, wearing the blue shirts of the Free German Youth League, some walking, some riding, are flocking to Berlin to attend the All-German Youth Peace Advocates Conference. New arrivals pour like a stream from the train station into the streets. In East Berlin, these festive processions can be seen everywhere. Young men and women from West Germany are also on their way to Berlin. Regardless of the terror policies, threats, and intimidation of the American and British authorities, regardless of the many hideous and enormous obstacles in their path to East Germany, they still crossed the district boundaries. Many young men and women from West Germany are taking roundabout routes, some having to travel three to four hundred kilometers by bicycle, while others are coming on foot.

　　Priyanov emphasized: The All-German Youth Peace Advocates Conference will become a moving demonstration of the determination of Germany's progressive forces, who are determined never again to allow aggressors to throw the younger generation of Germany into war. This conference will also be a grand review of the achievements of East German youth in peaceful labor over the past five years.

　　“条条大道通柏林！”
    消息报评论全德民主青年大会
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报于二十六日刊载该报记者普利扬诺夫来自柏林的电讯，论及行将到来的全德民主青年大会。
    普利扬诺夫在援引一家德国报纸所说的话：“现在德国条条大路通柏林”之后，写道：这倒真不是夸大的说法。数十万青年男女，身着自由德国青年联盟的蓝衫，有的步行，有的乘车，正络绎不绝地走向柏林，参加全德青年和平拥护者的大会。新到的人从火车站流水似地涌入街道，在柏林东区，处处都可看到这些节日的行列。西德的青年男女，也在前往柏林途中。不顾美英当局的恐怖政策与威胁恫吓，不顾在他们走往东德路上的许多狰狞的巨大障碍，他们还是越过了区界。很多的西德青年男女们走着迂回曲折的道路，有的必须乘自行车行走三四百公里，而另外有些人则徒步而来。
    普利扬诺夫强调指出：全德青年和平拥护者大会，将成为德国进步力量之决心的动人的大示威，他们决心再也不让侵略者把德国的青年一代投入战争中。这个大会将同时是东德青年最近五年来在和平劳动中所获得的成绩的大检阅。
