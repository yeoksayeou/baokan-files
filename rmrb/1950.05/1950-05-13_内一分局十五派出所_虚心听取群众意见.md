　　Fifteenth Police Station of the First Internal Precinct
　  Humbly Listens to Public Opinion
    [Our Newspaper] On the 25th of last month, the Fifteenth Police Station of the First Internal Precinct invited more than 400 residents from the area to a forum. The police station reported on its work over the past three months. After listening to the report, the masses spoke enthusiastically. Everyone used vivid examples to praise the significant achievements made by the police station in public security, winter defense, sanitation, and public welfare since liberation, especially in the past three months. They also praised the arduous working style of the cadres and police officers. Wang Huaxuan, a refinery worker from No. 26 Chouti Hutong, said: "The police station reporting its work to the masses, conducting self-criticism, and asking the masses for their opinions is truly unprecedented; this is indeed the government of the people." Regarding the work, the masses felt that the police station was too lenient in dealing with bad people. The masses also raised many criticisms and opinions about the undesirable behavior of individual cadres and police officers, such as cadre Gong Baotian having beaten someone, police officer Li Songquan often drinking alcohol, and having played cards once in January, police officer Li Huafang having a bad attitude towards the masses; and the duty officer Bai Yugui having a bureaucratic style when solving problems, etc. Lian Yongfu, the head of the security group in Yangmao Hutong, was so moved that he made a self-criticism on the spot, believing that he had not contacted the masses enough in the past, often had a coercive command style, and his work was not thorough enough. After the participants continued to speak, Branch Director Zhao spoke last. In addition to expressing his sincere acceptance of the opinions raised by everyone and his determination to improve, he hoped that everyone would "say everything they know and say it completely" in the future to assist the government in doing its work well.

　　内一分局十五派出所
　  虚心听取群众意见
    【本报讯】上月二十五日，内一分局十五派出所邀集本地区居民四百余人开座谈会。派出所报告了三个月来的工作。群众听完报告，纷纷发言。大家都以生动的例子，赞扬解放以后，尤其是近三个月来，派出所在治安、冬防、清洁卫生、群众福利等工作上，作出显著成绩。并赞扬干部警士们艰苦的工作作风。抽屉胡同二十六号炼油工人王化宣说：“派出所向群众报告工作、自我检讨、还请群众提意见，这种民主作风，的确是旷古未有的事；这实在是人民大众的政府。”在工作上群众认为派出所对坏人处理太宽大了。对个别干部警士的不良作风，群众也提出了许多批评和意见，如干部龚宝田打过人，警士李松泉常喝酒，一月份还打过一次牌，警士李华芳对群众态度不好；值勤警士白玉贵解决问题时，有官僚主义作风等。羊毛胡同治安组长连永福感动得当场自我批评，认为以往联系群众不够，常有强迫命令作风，工作也不深入。参加会的人，继续发言后，赵分局长最后发言，除表示诚恳接受大家提出的意见并坚决改进外，希望大家以后“知无不言，言无不尽”，协助政府作好工作。
