Phrases Similar to "Drinking Rice"
Ye Shengtao

We say "eat rice" and "drink tea," and no one will say it wrong. Some places also say "eat tea," but never "drink rice," because "rice" simply cannot be "drunk." Beijingers say "drink congee." It is "congee," of course, so it can be "drunk."

However, phrases similar to "drinking rice" are very common. Reading newspapers and magazines, you can encounter them anytime. What is printed in newspapers and magazines is writing, so it seems it should be said to be written incorrectly. In reality, writing is based on language, and writing incorrectly means speaking incorrectly. Language is also a tool of thought, and speaking incorrectly also means thinking incorrectly. If someone says "drink rice," they are not only saying the wrong thing, but also thinking the wrong thing, as if they thought "rice" could somehow be "drunk."

The so-called phrases similar to "drinking rice" are where the related verb and noun do not match.

Now, let's give some examples to illustrate this. These examples were collected by my friend Mr. Zhu Wenshu. For convenience, he took notes every day while reading the *People's Daily*, and the notes are not limited to this type of example.

(1) Our state-owned trading company is launching retail stores throughout the city – April 10th, first edition, "Significant Results in Unified Financial and Economic Work, Prices in Beijing and Shanghai Begin to Stabilize"

(2) Receive passenger baggage – April 6th, first edition, "All-China Federation of Trade Unions Standing Committee Approves Resolution of National Congress of Transport Workers' Union"

(3) American diplomats fabricate various schemes – April 6th, first edition, "Truth Daily Reporter Reports on America Burying the United Nations"

(4) And we can hope for a bright future for general economic cooperation between our country and the Soviet Union and other friendly countries – April 5th, first edition, "Editorial"

(5) Our goal can be achieved ahead of schedule – April 4th, first edition, "Joint Sino-Soviet venture is helpful for China's economic construction, Capital People Express Support"

(6) The content of political teaching materials compiled by various places for winter schools is too deep, and cannot be competently handled by general winter school teachers – April 4th, third edition, "How Shandong Solves the Problem of Winter School Teachers"

(7) Transform burden – April 4th, second edition, "Shulu Spring Ploughing Forms Spontaneously"

(8) Guaranteed the needs of China's rapidly growing national economy and national defense – April 12th, first edition, "The Great Significance of Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation"

(9) Significant achievements have been made – April 16th, first edition, "Achievements of Various Places in Conscientiously Implementing Unified Financial and Economic Decisions in the Past Month"

(10) Many achievements have been received – Ibid.

(11) Implement project quality – April 16th, second edition, "The First Phase of Shandong's Yellow River Control Project Largely Completed"

(12) We only realize today the brightness of Northwest construction – April 18th, third edition, "Everywhere are Rich Resources and Brave People"

(13) Rescued a large number of disaster victims – April 19th, second edition, "The First Phase of the Shouzhang Embankment Restoration"

(14) Defeated the patrols of Chiang Kai-shek bandit ships – April 21st, first edition, "Letter to Kuomintang Officers and Soldiers on Hainan Island"

(15) Strictly prohibit disorderly trampling, fighting, etc. within the site – April 21st, fourth edition, "Beijing Municipal School Production Committee Sixth Meeting Decides to Strengthen Production Leadership and Overcome Current Shortcomings in School Production"

(16) Exposed many phenomena such as no one being responsible and the associated lax discipline – May 9th, second edition, "Production Responsibility System Universally Established in Publicly Owned Industrial and Mining Enterprises in Northeast China"

(17) All personnel who are nominally receiving salaries must be terminated – May 9th, first edition, "Tianjin Private Machine Dyeing and Finishing Industry Labor and Management Sign Agreement to Overcome Difficulties"

(18) And hope that all personnel of the factory will prevent any complacency – May 9th, second edition, "Northeast People's Government Chairman Gao Gang Inspects Shenyang Smelter"

(19) Timely resolve various ideological concerns of migrant workers – May 12th, first edition, "East China Carries Out Spring Repair of the Jianghuai Main Embankment and Guides the Yi River"

(20) Migrant workers sending grain home has solved the famine for approximately 80,000 families – May 12th, first edition, "Tangyu River Excavated in Northern Jiangsu Completed"

In example (1), "launching" is usually just "launch," or "establish" as a disyllabic word. The author probably meant to gradually establish retail stores throughout the city, with a sense of development, so they used "launching." However, "launching" can only be paired with a type of business or movement. A retail store is a store, not a business; retail is its business.

In example (2), "passenger baggage" does not need and cannot be "received" in the same way as a guest. This does not need detailed explanation.

Let's talk about example (3). Everything that is "fabricated" is prepared to be made public, such as news prepared to be told to others, documents prepared to be shown to others. A "scheme" is hidden in the heart and never willingly made public. A "scheme" can also be spoken or carried out, but when it is spoken or carried out, no one willingly says "this is a 'scheme.'" Of course, here it is not American diplomats saying it themselves, but us saying it, identifying it as a "scheme." To make it match, saying "devised" would work.

The core of example (4) is "hope" and "future," which is confusing. We can say "have" such and such "future," or we can say "hope" "to have" such and such "future," but there is no way to say "hope" such and such "future."

A "goal" is set in place. According to the "goal," once achieved, it is "reaching" the "goal." But example (5) uses "achieve." What matches with "achieve" are nouns like "plan" and "ideal."

Example (6) says winter school teachers cannot "competently handle" "political teaching materials." Whenever saying "competent" or "incompetent," it refers to work. "Political teaching materials" are not work; teaching "political teaching materials" is work. The author certainly also meant teaching "political teaching materials," but did not say it correctly.

Regarding example (7): whether a mental "burden" or a material "burden," "increasing," "decreasing," or "adjusting" is possible, but not "transforming."

The core of example (8) is "guarantee" and "need." For example, Zhang San has a need to eat, and Li Si "guarantees" his "need." Does this mean Li Si "guarantees" to give Zhang San food? This is confusing enough. Li Si promises to give Zhang San food, which is "guaranteeing" "to supply" Zhang San's "need," or "guaranteeing" "to satisfy" Zhang San's "need."

Examples (9) and (10) both say "achievements." "Achievements" are made, and you can say "make." Once made, you can say "have." "Achievements" are not external things, so they do not match with "obtain" or "receive."

To save space, half of the twenty examples have been discussed. The remaining half are left for the readers to study themselves. There are two more examples that can be discussed.

(21) It will have a huge impact and powerful assistance on the nation's financial construction and economic construction – May 9th, second edition, "Productive Northeast Finance"

(22) To strictly establish and accurately implement the financial budget and final account system – Ibid.

The previous examples were all cases of a verb not matching a noun. Here, in example (21), one verb faces two nouns, one matching and one not matching. In example (22), two verbs face one noun, one matching and one not matching. "Have" "impact" is correct, but how can "assistance" "have" an impact? Saying "establish" "system" is no problem, but saying "implement" "system" is open to discussion. When the superior issues an order, or a meeting makes a resolution, we act according to it, which is "implementing." A "system" is a complete set of regulations. When the regulations are properly established, it is called "establishing," and acting according to the regulations is called "enforcing." For example, institutions and organizations all have a meeting system. We never describe attending a meeting as "implementing the meeting system," which proves that "implement" and "system" do not match. However, in example (22), if "enforce" were moved to "implement," it would become "accurately enforce," which is still inappropriate. The problem lies in "accurately" again.

I am writing this little piece not to nitpick. I sincerely hope that everyone writes correctly, which means speaking correctly, which also means thinking correctly. The impact of newspapers and magazines is too great, and I am only afraid that errors will be passed on. If the editors and readers think this is somewhat meaningful, then other topics can be discussed later.

### 类乎“喝饭”的说法

　　类乎“喝饭”的说法
    叶圣陶
    咱们说“吃饭”“喝茶”，谁都不会说错。有些地方也说“吃茶”，可是决没有说“喝饭”的，因为“饭”根本没法儿“喝”。北京人说“喝稀饭”。是“稀饭”，当然可以“喝”。
    然而类乎“喝饭”的说法非常普遍，看报，看杂志，随时可以碰到。印在报上杂志上的是文字，似乎应该说写错。实际上文字依据语言，写错就是说错。语言又是思想的工具，说错也就是想错。如果谁说了“喝饭”，他不但说错了话，而且想错了心思，仿佛他以为“饭”可以怎么样“喝”似的。
    所谓类乎“喝饭”的说法就是相关的动词跟名词搭不拢来。
    现在举一些例子来说一说。这些例子是我的朋友朱文叔先生搜集的。为了方便，他每天看《人民日报》作摘记，记下的并不限于这一类的例子。
    （一）我国营贸易公司在全市开展零售店——四月十日第一版《统一财经工作发生显著效果京沪物价开始稳定》
    （二）接待旅客行囊——四月六日第一版《中华全国总工会常务委员会批准搬运工会全国代表大会的决议》
    （三）美国外交人员捏造各种诡计——四月六日第一版《真理报记者报道美国在埋葬联合国》
    （四）而且可以希望我国与苏联和其他友好国家的一般经济合作事业的光明前途——四月五日第一版《社论》
    （五）我们的目标是可以提前实现的——四月四日第一版《中苏合股创办公司有助我国经济建设首都人民咸表拥护》
    （六）各地编的冬学政治教材内容较深，为一般冬学教师所不能胜任——四月四日第三版《山东怎样解决冬学师资问题》
    （七）改造负担——四月四日第二版《束鹿春耕形成自流》
    （八）保证了中国迅速增长的国民经济及国防的需要——四月十二日第一版《中苏经济合作的伟大意义》
    （九）已取得显著成绩——四月十六日第一版《一个月来各地认真执行统一财经决定的成绩》
    （十）已收到不少成绩——同上
    （十一）贯彻工程质量——四月十六日第二版《山东第一期治黄工程大部完成》
    （十二）我们今天才体会到西北建设的光明——四月十八日第三版《到处是富源和勇敢的人民》
    （十三）挽救了大批灾民——四月十九日第二版《寿张的第一期复堤》
    （十四）打败了蒋匪舰艇的巡逻——四月二十一日第一版《告海南岛国民党军官兵书》
    （十五）严禁在地内乱踏、打闹……等现象——四月二十一日第四版《京市学校生产委员会第六次会议决定加强生产领导克服目前学校生产缺点》
    （十六）揭发了许多无人负责以及与此相关联的纪律松懈等现象——五月九日第二版《东北公营各工矿企业普遍建立生产责任制》
    （十七）凡挂名领薪之人员一律截止——五月九日第一版《天津私营机器染整业劳资订协定克服困难》
    （十八）并望该厂全体人员防止任何自满情绪——五月九日第二版《东北人民政府主席高岗检查沈阳冶炼厂》
    （十九）及时解决民工各种思想顾虑——五月十二日第一版《华东进行江淮干堤春修及导沂》
    （二十）民工送粮回家约解决了八万家属的灾荒——五月十二日第一版《苏北开凿唐豫河竣工》
    （一）例里的“开展”通常只说“开”，用个双音词就是“开设”。大概作者的意思是在全市逐步的添设零售店，有发展的意味，所以用了“开展”。可是“开展”只能跟一种业务或者运动搭拢，零售店是店，不是业务，零售才是它的业务。
    （二）例的“旅客行囊”不需也不能像客人一样的给它“接待”，是不用细说的。
    再说（三）例。凡是“捏造”的东西都是准备公开的，如准备说给人家听的消息，准备拿给人家看的证件。“诡计”是藏在心里头决不肯公开的。“诡计”也可以说出来干出来，可是在说出来干出来的时候，决不肯说明我这个是“诡计”。这儿当然不是美国外交人员自己说，是咱们说，认定它是“诡计”。要搭得拢，说“想出”就成了。
    （四）例的骨干是“希望”“前途”，这叫人想不明白。咱们可以说“有”怎么样的“前途”，也可以说“希望”“有”怎么样的“前途”，可是没法说“希望”怎么样的“前途”。
    “目标”是摆定在那里的，按照“目标”做到了，就是“达到”“目标”。可是（五）例用了“实现”。跟“实现”搭得拢的是“计划”“理想”一类的名词。
    （六）例说冬学教师不能“胜任”“政治教材”。凡是说“胜任”不“胜任”，都指工作而言。“政治教材”不是工作，教学“政治教材”才是工作。作者的意思当然也是教学“政治教材”，可是没有正确的说出来。
    关于（七）例：无论精神上的“负担”，物质上的“负担”，“加重”“减轻”或者“调整”是可以的，可是不能“改造”。
    （八）例的骨干是“保证”“需要”。比方说，张三有吃饭的需要，李四“保证”他的“需要”，是不是等于说李四“保证”给张三吃饭呢？这是够叫人糊涂的。李四答应给张三吃饭，是“保证”“供应”张三的“需要”，或者说“保证”“满足”张三的“需要”。
    （九）（十）两例都说“成绩”。“成绩”是做出来的，可以说“做出”。已经做出来了，可以说“有了”。“成绩”不是外在的东西，所以跟“取得”“收到”搭不拢。
    为了节省篇幅，二十个例子说了一半儿吧，余下一半儿请读者自己去研究。还有两个例子可以说一说。
    （廿一）它对全国的财政建设和经济建设将发生巨大的影响和有力的援助——五月九日第二版《生产建设性的东北财政》
    （廿二）以严格建立和准确执行财政预决算制度——同上
    前面的那些例子都是一个动词跟一个名词搭不拢。这儿（廿一）例是一个动词对两个名词，一个搭得拢，一个搭不拢，（廿二）例是两个动词对一个名词，一个搭得拢，一个搭不拢。“发生”“影响”是不错的，但是，“援助”怎么“发生”呢？说“建立”“制度”毫无问题，说“执行”“制度”就可以讨论。上级发下来的命令，会议作成的决议案，咱们照着办去，这是“执行”。“制度”是成套的规定，规定妥当了，叫做“建立”，照规定的办了，叫做“施行”。譬如机关社团都有会议制度，咱们从来不把参加会议说成“执行会议制度”，可以证明“执行”跟“制度”是搭不拢的。不过在（廿二）例里，如果把“施行”调去“执行”，就成“准确施行”，还是不妥当，毛病又在“准确”了。
    我写这篇小东西决不是挑人家的眼儿。我诚恳的希望大家写得正确，也就是说得正确，也就是想得正确。报跟杂志的影响太大了，我只怕以误传误。如果编者跟读者认为这还有点儿意思，以后再可以说些旁的。
