Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 7th: Shandong Province successfully completed the first phase of the Yellow River spring repair project in mid-April. The Provincial People's Government recently issued instructions for the commencement of the second phase of spring repair work. The instructions pointed out that the second phase of the spring repair project is a decisive key to improving the strength of river defenses and ensuring victory in this year's flood season. Leading cadres at all levels should take charge and be responsible for mastering the work, organically combining spring repairs with other work, especially production and disaster relief work, and allocating sufficient cadres to participate in the specific work of the second phase of spring repairs, to ensure the complete realization of the engineering requirements. The instructions pointed out that this phase of the project requires the mobilization of approximately 100,000 laborers. At present, it is the period of spring famine when the old crops have been exhausted and the new crops have not yet been harvested. If the spring repair work can be closely combined with production and disaster relief work, it will play a significant role in disaster relief. However, when using work as a form of relief, we should pay close attention to the quality of the project.

　　山东完成首期黄河春修
    省府指示进行下期工程
    【新华社济南七日电】山东省黄河第一期春修工程已于四月中旬胜利完成，省人民政府最近又发出了进行第二期春修工作的指示。该指示指出：第二期春修工程是提高河防强度、确保今年防汛胜利的决定关键。各级领导干部应分工负责掌握，使春修与其他工作特别是生产救灾工作有机地结合起来，并配备足够的干部参加二期春修中的具体工作，以保证工程要求的彻底实现。指示指出：本期工程约需动员民工十万人左右，目前正青黄不接的春荒时期，春修工作如能与生产救灾工作密切结合，则对救灾将起巨大作用，但在以工代赈时应切实注意工程的质量。
