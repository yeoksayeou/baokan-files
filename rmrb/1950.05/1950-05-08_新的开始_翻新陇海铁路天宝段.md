　　New Beginning
    ——Renovating the Tianbao Section of the Longhai Railway
    By our reporter Chen Ji
    From Baoji to Tianshui, following the winding Wei River, through the steep mountains and valleys, the Tian(shui)-Bao(ji) section stretches from east to west. This is currently the only important transportation artery in Northwest China. This line was completed in 1945 and is 153 kilometers long. Along the way, there are 126 tunnels, totaling 21 kilometers in length, which is equal to the total length of tunnels on other lines in Guannei (areas within mountain passes). There are 97 large and small bridges and 576 culverts along the line. On the train in the Tianbao section, people never get tired of seeing the mountain caves, bridges, and towering peaks. Such a difficult and great project fully demonstrates the wisdom and creative power of the Chinese working people.
    Seven or eight years ago, fifty to sixty thousand workers shed blood and sweat here. A group of old workers who once built this road recalled the scene of building the road at that time: Under the heavy exploitation of contractors, they worked day and night without enough to eat. They petitioned several times, but were suppressed by the reactionary government. They suffered cruel exploitation and also had to defend against bandits and Zong Nan's forced conscription. At that time, workers digging earthwork, under the strict supervision of the contractors, dared not leave the site even for a step. Sometimes the high-altitude earthwork would suddenly collapse, and they would be buried alive. It is estimated that no less than several hundred workers died in this way.
    The roadbed along the Tianbao section is soft, and the train shakes constantly when it runs on it. But according to passengers who often travel this road, the situation is very different from the past. There is a ballad circulating on this road: "The Bao-Tian Railway is a mess, it's either a collapse or a derailment." When this road was built, the Kuomintang reactionaries embezzled and enriched themselves, and most of the projects along the line were cut corners. The curves, slopes, culverts, and bridges were mostly substandard, and most of the necessary equipment on the railway was incomplete. Since it was opened to traffic in 1945, an average of 500,000 cubic meters of earthwork collapsed every year, and last year alone, 640,000 cubic meters collapsed. The Tianbao Railway was nominally open to traffic, but it was actually in a state of paralysis. From 1945 to 1949, the actual opening date was only one year, and in 1947 it was only open for more than forty days. After liberation, the People's Government attached great importance to this railway and proposed the slogan of transforming the Tianbao Railway. The Xi'an Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau was responsible for measuring the conditions along the line. In the measurement work, old workers and farmers along the line were specially interviewed, so that technical theory and practical experience were combined to solve many problems. In early March this year, Soviet experts and engineering personnel from the Ministry of Railways went deep into the site for investigation and determined a plan to renovate the Tianbao Railway, and decided that the First Field Army and the Railway Corps Mechanical Road Construction Team would be responsible for the renovation work.
    Now, the north bank of the Wei River and the peaks of the Qinling Mountains are filled with the People's Liberation Army. With the heroic posture of combat, they climbed up the steep mountain peaks, and were active in the gloomy canyons, holding shovels and hoes to dig earthwork; carrying baskets to transport earthwork, the steep earthwork project will be completed in their fiery labor. When a train of road construction machinery moved westward along the Wei River, we saw countless steel, cement, and gunpowder continuously being transported to the construction site. When the loud noise of gunpowder exploding in the mountain caves reached everyone's ears, we thought that on the Tian(shui)-Lan(zhou) line further west, another unit of the First Field Army would also begin construction. In a few years, there will be longer railways in the Great Northwest. At that time, from southeast to northwest, and from northwest to southwest, trains will run back and forth non-stop. The Hami melons of Xinjiang, the petroleum of Yumen, and the old sheepskins of the Northwest will flow continuously across the Chinese mainland.

　　新的开始
    ——翻新陇海铁路天宝段
    本报记者  陈迹
    从宝鸡到天水，沿着曲折的渭河，通过险峻的高山与峡谷，天（水）宝（鸡）段路由东向西蜿蜒伸展着。这是目前我国西北部仅有的一条重要交通干线。此线于一九四五年完工，全长达一百五十三公里。沿路有一百二十六座隧道，共长二十一公里，等于关内其他各线隧道长度的总和。沿线大小桥梁共九十七座，涵洞五百七十六座。在天宝段的火车上，人们看不完山洞、桥梁和高山峻岭。像这样艰险伟大的工程，充分显示了中国劳动人民的智慧与创造力量。
    七八年前，五六万工人曾在这里流血流汗。一群曾经修筑这条路的老工人，回忆当年修路的情景说：他们在包商的重重剥削下，日以继夜地劳作，不得一饱。他们曾经几次请愿，均被反动政权压制了。他们受着残酷的剥削，还要堤防胡匪宗南抓丁。当时，挖土方的工人，在包商的严厉督促下，不敢离开现场一步，高山土方有时骤然崩坍，他们就要被活埋在土里。像这样死去的工人，估计不下几百人。
    天宝段沿线路基松软，火车走在上面，摇摆不停。但据常走这条路的旅客们说，现在的情形，和过去比起来已大不相同了。在这条路上，流传着这样一首歌谣：“宝天铁道瞎胡闹，不是坍方就掉道。”修筑此路时，国民党反动派大肆贪污中饱，沿线工程大多偷工减料，弯道、坡度、涵洞和桥梁多半不合标准，铁路上各种应有设备亦多残缺。一九四五年通车以来，平均每年都要崩坍五十万土方，去年一年竟坍塌土方六十四万方。天宝铁路名为通车，实际处于一种瘫痪状态。从一九四五年到一九四九年，通车日期实际不过一年，一九四七年仅通车四十余天。解放以后，人民政府十分重视这条铁路，提出改造天宝铁路的口号，并由郑州铁路局西安分局负责测量沿线情形。在测量工作中，特别访问了沿线老工人和农民，使技术理论和实际经验结合起来，解决了不少问题。今年三月初，苏联专家和铁道部工程人员又深入现场考察，确定了整修天宝铁路的计划，并决定由第一野战军及铁道兵团机械筑路队担任整修工作。
    现在，渭河北岸，秦岭山巅，布满了人民解放军。他们以作战的英勇姿态，爬上险峻山巅，活跃在阴深峡谷中，拿着铲子、锄头，挖土方；担着菠箕，运土方，峻削的土方工程就要在他们火热的劳动里完成。当一列列筑路机械沿着渭河向西前进的时候，我们看见无数钢铁、洋灰和火药不断地载往施工地点。当火药爆炸山洞的巨响传进每个人耳里时，我们又想到在更西的天（水）兰（州）线上，第一野战军另一部也要动工了。几年之后，大西北会有更长的铁路出现，那时，从东南到西北，从西北到西南，火车将要不停地反复奔驰，新疆的哈密瓜，玉门的石油，和西北的老羊皮，就会源源穿流在中国大陆上。
