Comrade Li Diancheng (a member of the Communist Party), a cadre of the 13th District Farmers' Association in Beijing, is active and responsible in his work in the district farmers' association. Last winter, during the land reform, he served as the deputy leader of the work team in Heiqiao Village. This year, when assigning production tasks, Comrade Li Diancheng was again dispatched to work in Heiqiao Village. Zhang Gui, the vice chairman of the village farmers' association, had always been doing poorly in his work. Since the beginning of the land reform, he has become even more passive and slack. The People's Government accepted the demands of the masses and removed him from his post. After that, Zhang Gui often made sarcastic remarks, hated the cadres elected by the farmers after the land reform, and often went to the village government to make trouble for the cadres. Everyone explained and educated him, but he not only didn't listen but even resorted to violence, and one morning, he beat the village party branch secretary, the village chief, and another person. When Comrade Li Diancheng went to reason with him, he was slapped twice. At this time, all the farmers, cadres, party members, and Youth League members in the village were very angry and wanted to beat Zhang Gui to vent their anger for the beaten village and district cadres. However, Comrade Li Diancheng did not get angry. He patiently explained to everyone, saying, "The Communist Party has never advocated beating people. Zhang Gui's beating is illegal, and we must never break the law." He calmly reported the situation in detail to the government, and only after approval was Zhang Gui sent to the Public Security Bureau for handling.

The 13th District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party praised Comrade Li Diancheng's ability to handle the problem calmly at a production conference attended by more than two hundred cadres and party members and called on everyone to learn from him.

　　李殿成同志作风好
    北京市十三区农会干部李殿成（中共党员），在区农会工作中积极负责。去冬土地改革时，他任黑桥村工作组副组长。今年布置生产任务，李殿成同志又被派到黑桥村工作。该村农会副主任张贵，一向工作不好，土地改革开始，他更消极怠工，人民政府接受群众要求，撤了他的职。此后，张贵经常怪话连篇，对土地改革后农民所选举的干部加以仇视，经常到村政府去作难干部。大家对他解释教育，他不但不听，反而动手打人，一天早晨就打了村支部书记、村长等三人。李殿成同志去和他说理，又被打了两个耳光。这时全村农民、干部、党、团员都非常气愤，顶着火气要打张贵，替被打的村、区干部出气。可是李殿成同志并没有冒火，仍然耐心地给大家解释说：“共产党从来不主张打人。张贵打人是犯法的，咱们可决不能犯法。”他很冷静地将此情况详细报告政府，经批准后才将张贵送公安局处理。
    中共十三区区委会对李殿成同志能冷静处理问题，曾在二百余干部党员参加的生产会议上提出表扬，并号召大家向他学习。
