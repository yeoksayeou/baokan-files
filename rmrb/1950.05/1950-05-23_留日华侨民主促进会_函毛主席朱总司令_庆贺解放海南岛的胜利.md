　　Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: The Central Committee of the Democratic Promotion Association of Overseas Chinese in Japan sent a letter from Japan to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, congratulating them on the liberation of Hainan Island. The full text of the letter is as follows:
    Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters who crossed the sea to liberate Hainan Island:

    The good news of the liberation of Hainan Island has reached us. Overseas Chinese in Japan and all progressive people in Japan are sincerely delighted and express their gratitude and respect to our People's Liberation Army for its arduous struggle across the sea to complete this unprecedented great achievement.

    Frankly speaking, this victory is not only a supreme blow to the comprador reactionary Japanese authorities, but also a bolt from the blue to their bosses—international monopoly capitalists. However, for the progressive people in Japan, it has further increased their belief in building a peaceful, democratic, and independent Japan, and it has further encouraged us overseas Chinese. From now on, we will be more loyal to our motherland, and we also believe that Taiwan will be liberated soon.

    On behalf of the overseas Chinese in Japan and the progressive people in Japan, we would like to extend our congratulations and respect to you.

                       Central Committee of the Democratic Promotion Association of Overseas Chinese in Japan
  Respectfully,

    函毛主席朱总司令           
    庆贺解放海南岛的胜利
    【新华社二十一日讯】留日华侨民主促进会中央委员会从日本写信给毛主席、朱总司令，庆贺解放海南岛。该信全文如下：毛主席、朱总司令、以及渡海作战解放海南岛的全体指战员诸位：
    解放海南岛的捷报传来，在日侨胞以及日本所有的进步人士，对我人民解放军这次不辞艰难渡海苦斗，而卒以完成空前伟业，莫不衷心欣悦，表示感激和敬意。
    率直地说：这次战捷，不但对买办反动的日本当局是个无上的打击，而对他们背后的老板——国际独占资本家们，也不啻一个晴天霹雳。可是这对日本进步人士来说，益发添增了建设和平民主独立的日本的信念，更鼓舞了我们侨胞。此后我们更要誓忠祖国，我们并且相信不久会解放台湾。
    谨将在日侨胞及日本进步人士的诚意，以本会的名义，向诸位致贺并致敬意。
                       留日华侨民主促进会中央委员会 
  鞠躬
