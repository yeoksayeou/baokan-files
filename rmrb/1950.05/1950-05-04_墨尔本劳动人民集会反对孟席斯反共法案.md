　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Menzies government of Australia's proposed fascist bill, which aims to declare the Australian Communist Party illegal, has aroused resolute opposition from the Australian working people. According to Reuters, about two thousand working people held a protest rally in Melbourne on April 30. Speakers at the meeting unanimously denounced the bill as a "hysterical threat to every democratic Australian" and denounced Menzies as an "evil dog" and "traitor" of American imperialism. On the same day, a mass rally was also held in Sydney. The treasurer of the Sydney branch of the Australian Waterside Workers' Federation called on all working people at the meeting to oppose the bill with strikes and joint action "in factories, meeting places and streets," "to fight for the rights and democratic freedoms of the Australian people and the freedom rights of the Communist Party." According to UPI, the Federal Public Service Union and the Sydney Machinists' Union both decided on that day to resolutely oppose the fascist bill. The Public Service Union declared that it would cooperate with other unions and groups to "destroy this encroachment on our established freedom." A resolution passed by the Sydney branch of the Machinists' Union condemned the Menzies bill, stating that "we are determined to do all we can to defend our union from any attack by Menzies."
