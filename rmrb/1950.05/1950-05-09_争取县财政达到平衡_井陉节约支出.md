　　Strive to Balance County Finances
    Jingxing Saves on Expenditures
    [Reported by this newspaper] Jingxing County, Hebei Province, under the principle of living within its means, has, through careful calculation, brought its fiscal revenue and expenditure close to balance this year. It is expected that the county can strive for no deficit in annual expenditure by conscientiously implementing savings and strict reviews in actual expenditures in the future.
    When the departments under the county made this year's budget, some department cadres believed that in today's peaceful environment, everything could be rebuilt, so the budget figures were very large. After the financial and economic authorities ordered the departments to reduce them automatically, it was still necessary to overspend more than 273,200 catties of grain. Later, in order to balance revenue and expenditure, the competent department, based on the principle of living within its means, reviewed the expenditures of each department one by one in detail, and reduced a total of more than 187,100 catties of grain, including items that could be not done or postponed, those that should be covered by provincial grain expenditures, and subsidies for village cadres. Although there is still a deficit of more than 86,000 catties, it is possible to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure if we conscientiously save and review various actual expenditures in the future. There are already several examples to illustrate this possibility. For example, the Public Security Bureau originally budgeted 1,280 catties of rice for moving and repairing houses, but after the Finance Section reviewed the planned expenditure, it only used about 600 catties, saving half; the Seventh District expected to spend 1,300 catties for moving, but actually only spent 500 catties, which was less than half of the original budget. In addition, the Armed Forces Department budgeted more than 3,400 catties of grain last winter for heating expenses for the militiamen guarding roads and lines, but in fact, winter has passed, and all villages have saved on this expense. In addition, a lot of expenses have also been reduced, such as grain transportation, adopting on-site allocation to save manpower, etc. (Wang Jing)

　　争取县财政达到平衡
    井陉节约支出
    【本报讯】河北省井陉县在量入为出的原则下，经过精打细算，使今年财政收支接近平衡；在今后实际支出中认真实行节约和审查，当可争取全年开支没有亏空。
    该县所属各部门在作今年预算时，有些部门干部认为在今天和平环境下，已可百废俱举，故预算数字非常庞大，经财经主管部门令各部门自动缩减后，尚须超支二十七万三千二百余斤。后主管部门为使收支平衡，本量入为出原则，将各部门开支再度逐一详加审核，将可以不办或者缓办的和应由省粮开支的，以及村干部的补助粮等共核减十八万七千一百余斤。虽仍有赤字八万六千余斤，如今后在各项实际支出中，认真节约和审查，当可做到收支相抵。而此种可能性，已有若干事例足以说明。如公安局因搬家修补房子，原预算用米一千二百八十斤，经财政科审查后按计划开支结果，仅用了六百斤左右，节省了一半；七区因搬家预计支出一千三百斤，实际亦只用了五百斤，还不到原预算的一半，又武装部去冬给护路护线民兵预算的烤火费三千四百余斤，但实际上冬天已过去，各村此项开支都节省下来了。另外，如粮食搬运，采取就地调拨方式节省脚力等亦减少了不少开支。（王靖）
