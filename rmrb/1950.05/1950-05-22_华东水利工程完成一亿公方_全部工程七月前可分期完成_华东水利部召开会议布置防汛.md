According to the statistics of the reports presented at the meeting, as of the end of April, the water conservancy projects in various parts of East China had completed a total of 100,070,5829 cubic meters of earthwork, accounting for 55.1% of the original plan. The unfinished projects will be completed in stages before the end of July, and the projects that do not meet the required standards will be repaired at the same time. According to the specific conditions and engineering conditions of various provinces and regions, the meeting decided that the Yangtze River, Huai River, and seawall projects should strive to ensure that the dikes do not break when the flood level is the same as in 1949, and strive to ensure that the dikes do not break even when the flood level reaches that of 1931; the Grand Canal should ensure that the dikes do not break when encountering the flood level of 1931. The meeting also stipulated that from now on, all parts of East China must fully prepare flood prevention materials, and should quickly establish and improve flood prevention organizations, and make thorough arrangements for flood prevention work. The meeting also formulated three draft plans for flood prevention measures, reporting methods, and dike maintenance methods for the Yangtze River, Huai River, Grand Canal, and seawalls in the East China region, which will be submitted to the East China Military and Political Committee for approval and implementation.
