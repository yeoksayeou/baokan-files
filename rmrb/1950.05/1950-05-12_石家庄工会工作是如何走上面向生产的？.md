　　How Did Shijiazhuang Trade Union Work Become Production-Oriented?
　　By Our Correspondent Rong An

　　Shijiazhuang's trade union work has initially implemented the policy of being oriented towards production. In the third production emulation campaign last year, it played a considerable role in ensuring the completion of production tasks.

　　The city has been liberated for more than two years. Although the city's trade union work has achieved considerable success in educating workers and guaranteeing production, some trade union cadres' understanding of the policy of trade union work being oriented towards production is not specific or clear enough. Therefore, promoting production through trade union work is not forceful enough. Some workers doubt: "If the trade union engages in production, what does the administration do?" Some individual workers also say: "We used our membership dues to buy a second mother-in-law." Many trade union cadres believe that "workers must improve their welfare first if they want to engage in production," and some trade union cadres say: "The workers elected us to do good things for them (i.e., welfare work), but the higher-ups want us to lead production. Isn't this putting us in a dilemma!" Most grassroots trade union cadres believe that "running the cooperative well can allow workers to buy cheap things, take more baths, and watch more movies. This is what it means to do a good job in trade union work." They do not understand that only by doing a good job in production is the most fundamental and far-reaching welfare for the working class, and that certain welfare work is to ensure the completion of production. Although each factory trade union has a production committee, its task is limited to organizing family members to engage in production and mobilizing workers to grow vegetables to improve their lives. They do not lead the production work in the entire factory. Many trade union cadres only want to be labor protection committee members, not production committee members, believing that only by being labor protection committee members can they seek welfare for the workers. Some people, because they engage in cultural entertainment, affect production.

　　In order to implement the policy of trade union work being oriented towards production, the city's Federation of Trade Unions clearly stated at the beginning of the third production emulation campaign last November: "The trade union must clarify its thinking on leading production, take the initiative to contact the administration, mobilize employees to actively participate in production, and give play to its organizational role. The work of various departments and cadres of the trade union organization, propaganda and education, and labor protection should all revolve around production." The city's Federation of Trade Unions also organized trade union cadres and workers to study through various forms (running training classes, holding lectures, etc.), so that trade union cadres and workers gradually clarified this thinking. For example, Bai Wengang, a city Federation of Trade Unions cadre who was born as a worker, said in his reflection that when the higher-ups transferred him to work in the production department of the city Federation of Trade Unions last year, he was very uneasy. First, because the production department had no specific work at the time; second, he felt that he could not seek welfare for the workers, which would let down the worker comrades' expectations of him. Later, when he was transferred to the labor protection department, he was very happy, feeling that he had finally done something good for the workers. Later, when inspecting welfare work, he realized that the reason why some factories had not done well in welfare work in the past was mainly because production was not good and the factories had not made money. He said: "Now I fully understand that only by leading workers to actively participate in production and developing production can welfare work be done well." His thinking was clear. This year, the higher-ups transferred him to work in the Production Committee (i.e., the Production Department) again. He works very comfortably and actively, and often goes deep into the factories to discover and solve the specific ideological problems of the workers. Gao Ke, a trade union cadre of the Shijiazhuang Enterprise Company, also realized after studying: "Only engaging in welfare is like sitting idly by and eating up all your resources. Only by doing a good job in production can welfare work have a foundation." Liu Changbin, the director of the trade union of the company, recalled that when he worked in a certain paper mill in the past, the paper mill collapsed due to poor production, causing many workers to lose their jobs. Therefore, he had a very deep understanding of what the long-term interests of the working class are. He said: "If production is not done well, nothing can be talked about."

　　After the ideological problems of trade union cadres and workers were initially resolved, the next step was to improve the grassroots trade union organizations and mobilize all aspects to carry out work around production. In the third production emulation campaign last year, considerable achievements were made. In order to make the trade union organizational work suitable for the needs of production and to give play to the role of grassroots organizations, the trade union groups and production groups in each factory were unified, changing the previous method of dividing production groups according to production units and trade union groups according to workers' residences or according to the administrative system, so as to make it more convenient for the trade union to lead production. In conjunction with the "Everyone Runs the Trade Union" campaign, cadres were added to the trade union groups to divide labor and take responsibility, strengthen leadership, and overcome the previous shortcomings of a few trade union cadres running the trade union and having no time to lead production due to being busy with daily trade union affairs. In addition, in order to give play to the role of grassroots trade union organizations in ensuring production, when the administrations of various factories formulate production plans, the trade unions mobilize trade union groups and trade union members to formulate individual plans and group plans based on the specific conditions of their groups, and mobilize everyone to carry out emulation campaigns to ensure the completion of tasks. For example, the administrative department of the weaving factory of the city's enterprise company originally stipulated that 814 bolts of cloth should be woven per month. After discussion and precise calculation by the trade union group, it was changed to 840 bolts per month. As a result of giving play to everyone's enthusiasm for production, the average daily output of cloth was 34 bolts, greatly exceeding the production task assigned by the administration. The trade union cadres of some factories also took the initiative to check the workers' labor discipline, work attitude, product quality, and the completion of production plans. Some held exhibitions of defective products, and publicized the reasons for the defective products on blackboards. This not only ensured the completion of the quantity, but also ensured the improvement of quality.

　　The propaganda and education, labor protection and other departments of the trade union should all carry out work around production. For example, the trade unions of factories such as glass, soap, machinery, and matches have jointly run spare-time schools; many factories have established technical research committees and technical research groups under the auspices of the trade union. They published wall newspapers and blackboards, commended models, and exchanged experiences. They organized workers to study, improve workers' ideological awareness and production technology, and ensure the completion of production tasks. In terms of labor protection and welfare work, various factories took the initiative to improve the workers' lives, pay attention to the workers' health, and overcome the previous拼命主義 (Pinyin: pīnmìng zhǔyì, "desperate style") in production emulation campaigns, so that the workers' production enthusiasm remained vigorous.

　　石家庄工会工作是如何走上面向生产的？
    本报记者　荣安
    石家庄工会工作初步贯彻了面向生产的方针，在去年第三次生产竞赛运动中，对于保证生产任务的完成，起了相当大的作用。
    该市解放已两年多了。该市的工会工作在教育工人，保证生产方面，虽已获得不少成绩，但由于若干工会干部，对工会工作面向生产的方针认识不具体，不明确，因此，通过工会工作推进生产，表现的还不够有力。有些工人怀疑：“工会搞生产，行政干什么？”也有个别工人说：“我们用会费买来了第二个婆婆。”不少工会干部则认为“工人要搞生产，必须先搞好福利”，还有些工会干部说：“工人选出来叫咱们办好事（即福利工作），上面又叫咱领导生产，这不是两头坐腊！”大部分下层工会干部则认为“办好合作社，能使工人买到便宜东西，多洗几次澡，多看几次电影，这就是搞好了工会工作”。他们不了解只有搞好生产，才是工人阶级最根本最远大的福利，一定的福利工作，是为了保证完成生产的。各厂工会虽然有生产委员，但其任务只限于组织家属生产，动员工人种蔬菜改善生活。对于整个工厂中的生产工作，则未加以领导。许多工会干部只愿当劳保委员，不愿当生产委员，以为只有当劳保委员才能为工人谋福利。有些人则因为搞文化娱乐，影响了生产。
    为贯彻工会工作面向生产的方针，该市总工会在去年十一月第三次生产竞赛开始时，即明确提出：“工会必须明确领导生产思想，主动联系行政，发动职工积极参加生产，发挥组织作用，工会组织、宣教、劳保等各项部门及各个干事的工作，都应围绕着生产来进行。”市总工会并通过各种形式（办训练班，举行讲座等），组织工会干部及工人学习，使工会干部和工人逐渐明确了这个思想。如工人出身的市总工会干部白文纲在反省中说：当去年上级调他到市总工会生产部工作时，他非常不安心。一来因为当时生产部没有具体工作；二来他觉得不能为工人谋福利，有负工人同志们对他的希望。后来调他到劳保部工作，他就非常高兴了，觉得总算给工人办了点好事。后来，在检查福利工作时，他才明白了，过去有些工厂福利工作没有做好，主要是因为生产不好，工厂没赚了钱。他说：“我现在可完全明白了，只有领导工人积极参加生产，生产发展了，才能做好福利工作。”他的思想通了，今年上级又调他到生产委员会（即生产部）中工作，他工作很安心，很积极，经常深入工厂，发现和解决工人具体思想问题。石家庄企业公司工会干部高克经过学习，也认识到：“光搞福利是坐吃山空，只有搞好生产，福利工作才有基础。”该公司工会主任刘昌彬回忆到他过去在某纸厂工作时，因生产不好，纸厂垮了台，使许多工人失了业，因此他对什么是工人阶级的长远利益体会非常深刻，他说：“生产搞不好，什么都谈不到。”
    工会干部和工人的思想问题初步解决之后，接着就是改进工会下层组织，发动各个方面，围绕生产进行工作。在去年第三次生产竞赛中，取得不少成绩。为了工会组织工作适合生产的要求，发挥基层组织的作用，各厂工会小组和生产小组统一起来，改变过去生产小组按生产单位划分，工会小组按工人住地或按行政系统划分的办法，使工会领导生产更加方便。并结合“大家办工会”，在工会小组中增加干事，分工负责，加强领导，克服了以往少数工会干部办工会，因忙于日常工会事务工作，无暇领导生产的缺点。此外，为了发挥工会基层组织保证生产的作用，各厂行政上订出生产计划时，工会就发动工会小组和工会会员，根据本组具体情况，订出个人计划与小组计划，发动大家开展竞赛，保证完成任务。如该市企业公司织布厂，行政上原规定每月织布八百十四匹，后经工会小组讨论，精确计算，改为每月八百四十匹。由于发挥了大家的生产积极性，结果每日平均产布三十四匹，大大超过了行政上布置的生产任务。有些工厂的工会干部并主动检查工人的劳动纪律，工作态度，产品质量及生产计划完成的情况。有的举行反工废活展览台，在黑板报上公布产品做坏的原因。这样不仅保证了数量的完成，也保证了质量的提高。
    工会的宣教、劳保等部门，都应该围绕生产进行工作，如玻璃、肥皂、机器、火柴等工厂的工会，曾经联合开办了工余学校；不少工厂在工会主持下，成立了技术研究委员会和技术研究小组。出版了壁报、黑板报，表扬模范，交流经验。组织工人学习，提高工人思想觉悟和生产技术，保证生产任务的完成。在劳保福利工作方面，各厂主动改善了工人生活，注意工人健康，克服了以往生产竞赛中的拚命主义，使工人生产情绪保持经常旺盛。
