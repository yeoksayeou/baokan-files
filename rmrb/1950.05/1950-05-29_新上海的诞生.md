　　The Birth of New Shanghai
    Song Qingling
    Recalling how Shanghai awoke from the nightmare of reactionary terror and began its new life, it has already been a year filled with events and fleeting time. For this, we hold boundless and heartfelt gratitude for the People's Liberation Army.
    In this year, we have come to understand many things. We have not only understood ourselves and this city, but also understood our future.
    How do we understand ourselves?
    We have discovered that the Chinese people possess unparalleled strength, surging vitality, and extraordinary talent. With these, we can solve all problems and difficulties. These are precisely what we need most, because the current situation is still very difficult. The revolutionary task we are undertaking is to change our economy so that it can serve the broad masses of the people, and at the same time, defeat those reactionaries. After a year, we have proven that both goals are attainable. We have witnessed the stabilization of the prices of daily necessities. We have also seen that there are no enemy planes harassing us in the sky, and that the People's Liberation Army has already landed on Hainan and the Zhoushan Islands. From this, we can imagine that there is no construction problem that cannot be solved, and it can be said that there is absolutely none. Furthermore, it is clear that we are rapidly clearing away all current obstacles. We will soon make our city and country prosperous and happy beyond anything in history. We can definitely accomplish this task, because we have the strength of the people, and even more so because our government was created by the strength of the people and is deeply rooted in the masses.
    How do we understand our city?
    Shanghai is the focus of the nation's attention. We are a symbol of the decisive battle with imperialism and bureaucratic capital. These vermin-like burdens have been weighing on the shoulders of our workers and ordinary people since Shanghai came into being. The whole country knows that the erosion of these pests is not easy to eradicate. Therefore, when we strive to transform Shanghai into a city owned by the people, and to make factories and all enterprises serve our country, they are all encouraging and supporting us.
    The workers in the Northeast are shouting to us: "You will soon be like us, with no one unemployed! Continue to fight!" They donated a large sum of money to support the Shanghai workers who were made unemployed by the enemy's air raids and blockades instigated by the imperialists, and engaged in relief efforts.
    Farmers in the interior also transported large quantities of grain to supply the needs of the city. This is proof of their trust in the people of Shanghai, and it makes our business community understand that after land reform takes effect and the purchasing power of the peasants gradually rises, the future market will continue to expand.
    The above will soon be effective. Six months ago, merchants had misunderstandings and complaints about the People's Government, but now they have understood and are willing to cooperate. They now understand that it is impossible to overcome the difficulties of imperialism, compradorism, and enemy air raids overnight. At first, they hoped that the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese Communist Party would create miracles in the short term. Now it is clear that nothing can be achieved if one sits and waits for hope. Because victory must be cultivated from hardship, sacrifice, and endurance. This is the lesson we have learned.
    After this new understanding expanded, people's faith in the future of New Shanghai grew stronger. They have trusted the plans of the People's Government, because it is clear that we can defeat the imperialists and reactionaries. Shanghai not only belongs to China, but also belongs to the people. This is what we have learned about our city in the year of liberation.
    What do we understand about the future?
    We have experienced that the People's Republic of China is like an extraordinarily strong baby. Although it must go through many illnesses in its infancy, it has the power to resist them. We will undoubtedly grow up strong and serve humanity.
    One of the diseases we inherited is an unsound water conservancy system. This has caused floods and famines in many regions of the country. But the government is rapidly remedying this, with the People's Liberation Army quickly building dikes, opening rivers, and planting trees in large numbers. At the same time, we are also having the victims in the disaster areas participate in this work, and transporting grain using various means of transportation. As a result, we are confident in the relief of disasters. The above can prove that we have the ability to overcome the occurrence of difficulties. Only those pseudo-philanthropists from the palaces of American monopoly capital are tired of hearing these facts. They want to monopolize everything in the name of treating diseases, including life itself. Let them keep this murderous poison! China can solve its own problems from the program of production for self-salvation.
    China's approach to the issue of relief points out the path China will take in the future. At the same time, we have other important symbols to prove it. For example, Vice Premier Chen Yun reported at the seventh meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on the unprecedented financial unification, and he explained the work of unified grain distribution. These two achievements have stabilized our economy. This is a miracle completed in the year after liberation. Previous governments had tried repeatedly for a hundred years, but all failed.
    In addition, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's May Day speech more accurately confirmed our hopes for the future. He announced that the agricultural products in the Northeast this year will increase by 37% compared to last year. In the past year, the number of workers in public enterprises has increased by 240,000; the average actual wage of employees has increased by 27%; and the number of private industrialists in Shenyang alone has increased by 23%.
    The above are all achievements since the establishment of the People's Government, and they also point out the path of development for Shanghai and other parts of the country.
    If we need help in the construction process, we have ways to obtain it. Because what we lack can be obtained from our neighbor—the Soviet Union; for example, the development of resources, trade and transportation, and the development of science and technology. We should be thankful that this kind of help is based on the principles of cooperation, mutual assistance, and mutual respect.
    In summary, China is like a healthy baby, overcoming all diseases, growing up day by day, and having a bright and unlimited future. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, we have entered the era of New Democracy. On the horizon, the dawn of socialism and a brand new and beautiful vision of New China are emerging. This is what we have learned about the future in the year since liberation.
    The people of Shanghai should understand the current task, because we have learned a lot since liberation, and we also understand our future very clearly. We should strive to build a new Shanghai and a new China.

### 新上海的诞生

　　新上海的诞生
    宋庆龄
    回忆上海从反动的恐怖恶梦中惊醒起来，开始了它的新生活，屈指已经过事迹纷呈，流光如驶的一年了。为此，我们对于人民解放军抱着无限的衷心感激。
    在这一年之中，我们了解了许多事情，我们不但了解了自己，了解了这个都市，而且了解到我们的将来。
    我们怎样了解自己呢？
    我们发现了我们中国人民有无比的力量，磅礴的生命力和卓越的天才，有了这些，就可以解决一切问题和困难。这些正是我们最需要的，因为目前所处的境遇还是很艰困。我们进行的革命任务，是在改变我们的经济，使能为广大人民群众服务，同时还要击败那些反动派。我们经过了一年的时间，证明这两个目标都可能达到的。我们目睹日用品的价格稳定了。我们又看到空中已无敌机来骚扰了，并且人民解放军在海南及舟山群岛已经登陆了。我们从此可以想像到没有一个建设的问题是不能解决的，并且可以说是完全没有。此外，很明显地，我们正在迅速扫除目前所有的一切障碍。我们不久将使我们的都市和国家臻于史无前例的富强康乐。我们一定可以完成这个任务。因为有了人民的力量，更因为我们的政府是人民的力量所创建，在人群中是根深蒂固的。
    我们怎样了解自己的都市呢？
    上海是全国视线集中的地方。我们是与帝国主义和官僚资本作决斗的象征。这些害虫似的重荷，自有上海以来，一直就压在我们工人和一般人民的肩背上。全国都知道，这些害虫的侵蚀，是不容易铲除的。所以当我们努力使上海变为人民所有的都市，并使工厂及一切企业都为我们国家服务的时候，他们都在鼓励、支援我们。
    东北的工人们向我们高呼着：“你们不久也可以像我们那样，没有一个失业的人了！继续奋斗吧！”他们为了支援被帝国主义者策动的敌机轰炸与封锁而致失业的上海工人们，捐助大宗款项，从事救济。
    内地的农民也运来了大批粮食，供应都市所需。这是证明他们对于上海人民的信任，并且使我们工商界明白，土地改革收到效果，农民的购买力逐渐上升以后，将来的市场会不断地扩大的。
    以上种种，不久将有成效。在半年以前，商人们对于人民政府曾有误会和埋怨，可是现在已经明了了，而且愿意合作了。他们现在明了要克服帝国主义、买办主义及敌机的骚扰的种种困难，不是一朝一夕所能办到的。最初他们希望人民解放军与中共在短期内会创造奇迹。现在已明了如坐待希望，任何事都不能成功的。因为胜利须从刻苦、牺牲、耐劳之中培养出来的。这是我们所学习到的教训。
    这种新的认识扩大以后，人们对于新上海的将来越来越发生信仰。他们对于人民政府的计划已经信任了。因为很明显地，我们是能够击败帝国主义者和反动派的。上海不但已属于中国的，并且也是人民的了。这就是我们在解放一年内对于自己都市所了解的地方。
    我们了解的将来是怎样的呢？
    我们体验到中华人民共和国好像一个异常壮健的婴儿，在童龄虽然必须经历过好些疾病，但是有抗拒疾病的力量的，我们是毫无问题地会长大强壮起来，顶天立地的为人类服务。
    我们从遗传得来的疾病之一就是不健全的水利制度。这在国内许多地域造成了水灾和饥荒。但政府已在急速补救，由解放军迅速筑堤、开河和大量植树。同时我们也使灾区的灾民参加这项工作，并且用种种运输工具输送粮食。结果，我们对于灾荒的救济已有了把握。以上都可以证明我们对于困难之发生已有克制的能力。唯有那些美国独占资本宫殿出来的伪慈善家，对于这些事实是厌闻的。他们想利用医治疾病的名义，希望包办一切，连生命都包括在内。让他们自己保留这种杀人毒药吧！中国可以从生产自救的纲领中解决自己的问题的。
    中国对于救济问题所采取的方针，指出了中国在将来所走的途径。同时我们还有其他种种重要象征可以证明。例如陈云副总理曾在中央人民政府委员会第七次会议中报告过史无前例的财政统一，他并解释了统一粮食分配的工作，这两项成就使我们的经济臻于稳定。这是在解放后一年之中所完成的奇迹。以前的政府曾经在百年之内屡次试行，但是都告失败的。
    此外，还有刘少奇副主席的五一演说，更正确地证实我们将来的希望。他公布东北在今年一年内农产品将较去年加百分之三十七，在去年一年内，公营企业工人数目增加了二十四万人；职工实际工资平均增加了百分之二十七；单是沈阳的私人工业家数，已增加了百分之二十三。
    以上所举都是人民政府成立以后的成就，也指出了上海与国内各地发展的道路。
    如果我们在建设过程中需要帮助，我们是有办法获得的。因我们所缺乏的，都可以从我们的邻邦——苏联得到帮助；例如对于资源的开发，贸易与交通以及科学技术的发展等。我们应该庆幸的，就是这种帮助都是根据合作、互助与互尊的原则出发的。
    总结以上所说，中国好像一个健康的婴孩，克服了一切疾病，日渐长大，将来欣欣向荣，有无限的前途。在英明的领袖毛主席及中国共产党领导之下，我们已进入新民主主义的时代。在地平线上已呈露出社会主义的曙光和一幅崭新而美丽的新中国的远景。这就是我们在解放一年来所了解到的将来。
    上海人民们对于当前的任务应当了解，因为我们自解放以来已学习了许多，并且对于我们的将来也了解得很清楚。我们应当为建设新上海和新中国而努力奋斗。
