　　Arranging Victory Properly
    Collective creation of Zhoushan Front Reporters

    Prior to this campaign to liberate the Zhoushan Islands, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) undertook arduous and comprehensive preparatory work to ensure this great victory.

    Because this campaign was a sea-crossing operation, the PLA had to overcome the difficulty of lacking modern amphibious assault equipment, using land forces piloting sailboats to fight against enemies entrenched on islands and implementing integrated sea, land, and air defenses. This forced the Zhoushan Front commanders and fighters of the PLA, inspired by the surging combat will to liberate the entire country, to suppress their eagerness to fight and patiently conduct arduous, complex, and comprehensive preparatory work before the battle. This preparation work was carried out day and night, on the front lines and in the rear, in various forms.

    As early as August of last year, unprecedented large-scale pre-battle preparations began. Engineers overcame fatigue, heat, cold, and rain, opening mountains and building roads, constructing bridges, docks, and shipyards, paving the way for the transportation of ammunition and materials and the movement of heavy artillery. Artillerymen transported cannons weighing thousands of pounds by manpower to the islands, dragged them through paddy fields, and pulled them up high mountains, positioning them in suitable locations. They used their long-range artillery fire to control the ocean and the sky, monitoring the actions of enemy planes and warships day and night, ensuring the progress of infantry training in front of the enemy and the safety of maritime transportation. Medical personnel were intensively improving the health of the island-training troops and carefully studying how to conduct maritime rescue. Tens of thousands of logistics personnel produced massive amounts of war materials and transported them from the distant rear to the front lines. Many ships mobilized and transferred from the Bohai Sea, in order to avoid damage and save time, either crossed dams, passed through rivers, and entered the sea, or were transported by train to the front lines. The soldiers called this "land-based flying boats." Accompanying these many ships to the front were thousands of fishermen and boatmen from the coastal areas of East China, who became the best teachers of sailors in the PLA. To complete all this preparatory work, from the front to the rear, from land to sea, from day to night, tens of millions of people were involved in this arduous struggle, contributing their wisdom and strength to eliminate the remaining bandits, liberate the coastal islands, and complete the people's revolutionary cause.

    In all the preparations of the infantry, the most important was how to learn navigation, conquer the ocean; at the same time, targeting the enemy's island defenses, to use the methods allowed by existing material conditions to defeat it. The key here was how to break through the enemy's fortifications and establish our army's new tactical thinking and tactical means. In the early days, this caused great difficulties for the most experienced commanders who had won hundreds of battles on land.

    To become familiar with sea conditions and the characteristics of the ocean, senior commanders personally went to the seaside to observe and to try out sailing, and set up observation posts on deserted islands, sending the best commanders and fighters with chronometers, telescopes, and surveying poles to the observation posts. The observers worked there non-stop. Their lives were extremely hard. The rainy weather of the South and the unpredictable sea storms often forced them to fight against rainstorms, scorching sun, and cold. Everyone's clothes were wet hundreds of times, often eating cold food and cold dishes. Many observers insisted on working while sick, sometimes working tensely under enemy bombing all day long. From the timely and detailed reports of the observation posts, the command organs were able to accurately grasp the enemy's situation and seize the opportunity for victory. Before an enemy's newly built bunker was completed, a mark had already been added to the command organ's 1:50,000 map. Then, the next day, the artillerymen had already made precise calculations, including this bunker in the predetermined destruction targets. And the infantry responsible for the attack had already proposed three or four methods of capturing and destroying fortifications.

    The Zhoushan Islands' sea surface is scattered with islands, and the wind direction is uncertain. The seemingly calm sea surface suddenly surges with滔滔 waves. The surging tide, sweeping through the Shandaohai Strait,衝激 into complex and varied rapids, whirlpools, and backwashes. The water surface is also covered with countless reefs. But the People's Liberation Army from the North were determined to subdue this unyielding current, to shatter the natural barriers in front of the enemy.

    Commanders and fighters, especially Communist Party members, combat heroes, and combat models, all volunteered to join the sailors' team.

    In the eight months, regardless of the hot summer or cold winter, regardless of the scorching sun or cold weather, the sailors worked hard day and night, from inland rivers to near seas, repeatedly testing their sailing skills in flowing water, head tide, rapids, and whirlpools, familiarizing themselves with the rules of the marine climate. Rowing made their short legs swell, poling blistered their hands, wading cut their feet on clam shells and gravel in the mudflats, anchoring sometimes broke their legs and threw them into the sea. Seawater, rainwater, and sweat kept their clothes almost never dry. When their skills became proficient, the sailors sailed far into the deep sea, exploring the main currents in huge winds and waves. To avoid harassment by bandits' planes and warships, this type of transportation was often chosen on days or nights of wind and rain. Sailors sometimes risked climbing to the top of the mast to take down the sails when the tarpaulin was not working in急风急雨; in big storms, when the ship was卷进 by the waves and about to capsize, they still steadily steered the ship, turning danger into safety. Many old boatmen along the coast praised with thumbs up in amazement: "In terms of skills, the comrades have nine points, but adding courage and determination, they have twelve points." The sailors also repelled numerous attacks by bandits in试舵. The ship of Ren Changrong, the captain of a certain unit, once independently repelled the encirclement of four enemy warships. One night, the ship captained by Xu Jinyou, the deputy captain of the sailor team of the Third Battalion of a certain unit, suddenly encountered a storm, and the ship capsized. The sailors crawled on the bottom of the ship and drifted for three days and three nights. The Communist Party group on the ship convened a meeting, calling on all comrades on the ship to fight calmly. They were constantly attacked by enemy planes during the day, and sometimes drifted close to enemy islands. All Communist Party members and non-Party members endured freezing, hunger, and fatigue, encouraging each other to fight tenaciously. Seven sailors were gloriously sacrificed one after another by the wind and waves. The remaining four people still insisted on fighting the ocean winds and waves, and finally returned to the coast and returned to the team.

    The People's Liberation Army, which had been invincible across the mainland from the Yellow River to the Yangtze River to the coast of the East China Sea, thus conquered the ocean. They quickly learned to predict sea storms and the rise and fall of tides, and identified the location of reefs. They often faced the sea breeze, smiling, opened their bronze chests, and freely traveled in the ocean all day long, singing the boat songs they had written themselves: "Comrades, determined and strong, drifting in the ocean in heavy rain, the sound of singing and the sound of waves cannot be separated, the sea water lets us pass on both sides. This spirit is hard to describe, as if it can sing all the sea water away."

    While the sailors heroically conquered the ocean, the infantry units were also diligently practicing the tactics and techniques of breaking through enemy formations day and night.

    Looking across the sea from the PLA's positions, one could see layers of dense water deer fences, gasoline barrel explosives, lighting devices, tall poles, roof-shaped iron wire nets, and plum piles arranged on the enemy's wave-lapped, dark gray mudflats and in the sea. Behind these defensive works were groups of bunkers and fire points. The remnant bandits turned these isolated islands into密密封锁 water cities.

    In response to the enemy's fortification and troop deployment situation, the PLA universally launched a pre-enemy training movement. In paddy fields with several inches of water and mud deeper than the feet, on beaches with疾风怒号 and surging waves, on steep and difficult-to-climb slopes, and in front of the barracks of every platoon and even every squad, all kinds of model fortifications were erected, and countless training grounds were opened up. During the day, one could see teams of commanders and fighters practicing various breaking actions and formations. At night, the shadows of sails掠过 the turbulent sea surface, sending groups of infantry to the landing points for exercises, and the sound of explosions roared across the sea surface and in the valleys all night long. From hot summer to cold winter, the commanders and fighters repeatedly practiced and imagined all kinds of situations. Having learned the actions on the mudflats during low tide, they studied how to break through when the tide rose to chest depth. Having become proficient during the day, they practiced at night. During the exercises, the soldiers sometimes froze their legs until they lost sensation, and sometimes became dizzy with heat. After the exercises, they fell asleep, still shouting slogans of advancing and killing the enemy in their dreams. Many company commanders and instructors had to check the bunks at night to prevent the soldiers from training regardless of their health. The PLA commanders and fighters, not only with traditional heroism, but also with the creation of collective wisdom, grasped victory in their own hands. People who entered the front-line troops were like entering an ocean of wisdom.

    A certain unit on the front lines once held a grand inspection of equipment for crossing the sea for combat. Hundreds of commanders, combatants, artillerymen, medical personnel, and stretcher bearers from various units carried various equipment they had created that was suitable for crossing the sea for combat. The "reviewing stand" was set up on a mountain near the sea. Across the coastline was the enemy-occupied island. From the telescope, one could see the enemy's formation very clearly. And the one hundred and several types of equipment displayed here were precisely the sharp weapons used to destroy and sabotage the enemy's陣 on the opposite shore. The people inspected laid out sand tables exactly like the enemy's陣配属. The creator and inventor of each piece of equipment took turns to come up and test their sharp weapons on the spot. Feng Yunpo, the company commander of a certain company, personally led the soldiers to test a type of blasting equipment created by the company. One could see the ships rushing in amidst continuous explosions and thick smoke, and the enemy's deer fences, wooden stakes, wire nets, and bamboo walls being destroyed and flying up one by one at the bow of the ship. The soldiers who jumped off the ship had already pressed against the bunkers假设 on the shore with bayonets in the blink of an eye.

    The wisdom and courage of countless people were gathered in the creation process of each piece of equipment. Many pieces of equipment had to risk life and death to finally be successfully tested, but the commanders and fighters showed the entrepreneurial spirit of great scientists and inventors, and completed these great inventions. But if anyone wants to record the glorious names of these great inventors and entrepreneurs one by one, it is difficult, because these great creations and inventions are often凝成 by the wisdom and blood of thousands of heroic collectives. During the entire pre-enemy learning movement, senior commanders of various units held several military meetings to collectively study and seek the correctness and consistency of tactical thinking. The PLA thus arduously and intensively created a complete set of tactics and techniques for sea-crossing operations.

    As time passed, the PLA's pre-battle preparations for liberating Zhoushan were approaching completion day by day in an all-round way. However, they kept in mind Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction: "Do not fight unprepared battles," and repeatedly checked, modified, and developed based on new changes in the enemy's situation, requiring them to be very correct and skilled. Therefore, each unit and branch of service universally conducted large-scale joint exercises, from boarding ships, crossing the sea, landing, breaking through, consolidating the beachhead, to deep development. The coordination of infantry, sailors, artillery, and other branches of service, and the maritime and land communications, were all carried out in actual exercises.

    The reporter visited an exercise of a certain unit. It was a moonlit night, and the sea was silent. Suddenly, a green tracer bullet rose into the sea and air, and the big exercise began. Looking up in the distance, under the moonlight, countless warships with white sails疾驶 over the surging sea surface. After a while, from the wooden boats that were跳荡 in the changing波光, tongues of fire from guns and cannons were fired at the shore. At the moment when the boat was about to reach the enemy's defensive works, continuous "隆隆" loud noises, the sea water腾空 and rose, blurring the entire beach with smoke and fog. At this time, nothing could be seen, only the sound of explosions and gunfire echoed greatly on the sea. Just as the reporter was astonished, a signal flare划破 the sky, announcing that the troops in the exercise had occupied the enemy's beachhead in five minutes.

    In this way, the PLA Zhoushan Front troops, in the long-term arduous war preparation process, constantly suppressed their full combat enthusiasm for eagerly殲滅 the enemy, overcame the physical fatigue and diseases that ordinary people could not endure, as well as the difficulties of material conditions, conquered nature, defeated the bandits' plane and warship bombing and harassment, saw through the enemy's fortifications and tactics, and defeated all the enemy's妄想 of困守. In this situation, the enemies, fearing the fate of death that was already inevitably approaching,仓惶 fled. However, the PLA's victory in liberating Zhoushan this time was by no means accidental. The PLA will, in the continued war preparation work, arrange the final victory of liberating Taiwan properly for the people of the whole country.

　　把胜利安排停当
    舟山前线记者集体创作
    人民解放军在此次解放舟山群岛的战役前，曾进行了艰苦的充分的准备工作，安排好这一伟大的胜利。
    因为这次战役是渡海作战，解放军必须克服缺乏现代化两栖作战装备的困难，以驾驶帆船的陆军来与盘踞着海岛并实行海陆空立体防御的敌人作战。这就使得为完成解放全国的澎湃的战斗意志所鼓舞着的人民解放军舟山前线指战员们，不得不抑制着急切求战的心情，耐心地在战前进行艰苦的复杂的充分的准备工作。而这种准备工作，乃是日日夜夜，在前线和后方，以各种各样的形式进行的。
    远从去年八月起，空前规模的战前准备工作就开始了。工兵们克服疲劳、寒热和风雨的侵袭，开山筑路，修建桥梁、码头、船坞，为弹药物资的输送和重炮的运动开辟了道路。炮兵们把重达数千斤的大炮，用人力运上海岛，拖过水田，拉上高山，安排在合适的位置上。他们以自己的远程炮火控制着海洋和天空，日夜监视着敌机和敌舰的行动，保证了步兵敌前练兵的进行和海上交通运输的安全。医务工作人员们，则在紧张地改进着海岛练兵部队的健康，细心地研究着如何进行海上的救护。成千成万的后勤工作人员们，生产着巨量的作战物资，并从遥远的后方源源运达前线。而许多远从渤海动员、征调来的船只，为了避免损坏和争取时间，有的是翻坝过江入海，有的则是用火车载运到前线来的，战士们把这叫做陆地飞舟。随同着这许多船只来到前线的还有华东沿海的千百渔民和船工，他们成为解放军中水手最好的教师。为了完成这一切准备工作，从前线到后方，从陆地到海洋，从白天到黑夜，千千万万的人们都卷入了这一艰苦的斗争，为消灭残匪，解放沿海各岛和完成人民革命大业而贡献出他们的智慧和力量。
    在步兵的一切准备工作中，最重要的是如何学会航海、征服海洋；同时还要针对着敌人岛上设防的特点，用现有的物质条件所可允许的方法来击破它。这里的关键便是在于如何突破敌人的防御工事和确立我军新的战术思想和战术手段。这在最初的时日里，曾使在陆地上百战百胜的最有经验的指挥员们感到了莫大的困难。
    为了熟悉海情和海洋的特性，高级指挥员们亲自到海边去观察，到海里去试航，在渺无人烟的荒岛上设立了观察所，派出最优秀的指战员们带着时计、望远镜和标杆到观察所去。观察员们在那里一刻不停地工作着。他们的生活是极其艰苦的，南方多雨的天气和难测的海上风暴，常使他们要和暴雨、烈日和寒冷作斗争。每个人衣服湿了上百遍，经常吃着冷饭和冷菜。许多观察员们常带病坚持工作，有时整日处在敌机轰炸下紧张地工作。从观察所及时而详细的报告中，指挥机关就得以准确地掌握敌情，把握胜利的时机。敌人一座新筑的碉堡还未完成，指挥机关五万分之一的地图上已经增添了一个标记。接着，到第二天，炮兵们便已经作好了精确的计算，将这一座碉堡列入预定的摧毁目标之内。而负担攻击任务的步兵，也已经提出三种或四种攻取和破坏防御工事的办法来了。
    舟山群岛的海面岛屿参差，风向无定。看来平静的海面，刹那间就奔腾起滔滔的巨浪。汹涌的潮水，卷过山岛海峡，冲激成复杂多端的急流、漩涡和回浪。水面下又满布着无数礁石。但来自北方的人民解放军却都有决心要制服这不肯驯从的海流，以粉碎敌阵前沿的自然屏障。
    指战员们特别是共产党员、战斗英雄、战斗模范们都自告奋勇地参加了水手队。
    在八个月不分炎夏隆冬、不管烈日的曝晒和寒冷的侵袭的岁月中，水手们日夜苦练着，从内河到近海，在顺水、逆水、急流、漩水中，反复考验着行船的技术，熟悉着海洋气候的规律。摇橹时把短腿摇肿，撑篙时把手上磨起血泡，涉水时脚上被泥滩里的蛤蜊壳和碎石割开血口，抛锚有时也划破了腿，连人抛下海去，海水、雨水和汗水，使衣服几乎从未干过。当技术熟练了，水手们就远航深海，到巨风大浪里去探察主流。为了避免匪机和匪舰的骚扰，这种运航常常选择在风雨交加的日子或夜晚进行。水手们有时曾在急风急雨、船篷收放不灵的时候，冒险急攀桅顶，取下篷帆；在大风暴中，当船身卷进浪涛快要颠复之际，仍稳掌船舶，转危为安。沿海许多老船工们都惊讶地翘着大拇指夸赞说：“论技术，同志们有九分，可是加上勇气和决心，就有十二分了。”水手们还在试舵中击退了匪军无数次的袭击。某部船长任长荣的船曾独力击退四只敌舰的包围。一次夜间，某部三营水手队副队长徐金友所驾驶的船突遇风暴，船翻了。水手们爬在船底上飘流了三天三夜，船上的共产党小组召开了会议，号召全船同志沉着斗争。白天不断遭受敌机的袭击，有时又漂近了敌岛，全船共产党员与非党员忍受着冻饿和疲劳，互相鼓励着要顽强斗争。七个水手先后为风浪卷去而光荣地牺牲了。剩下的四个人仍旧坚持与海洋风浪进行斗争，最后终于回到了海岸，回到了队伍中来。
    从黄河而长江而东海之滨，纵横大陆曾无敌手的人民解放军，就这样战胜了海洋。他们很快地学会了预测海上的风暴和潮水的起落，辨别了暗礁的所在。他们常常迎着海风，含着微笑，敞开紫铜色的胸膛，终日在海洋中自由来往，歌唱着自己编写的船头诗：“同志们，决心强，大雨之中漂海洋，歌声浪声分不开，海水看了让两旁。这种气概难形容，好像能把海水都唱光。”
    与水手们英勇战胜海洋的同时，各步兵部队则同样日日夜夜地勤学勤练着攻破敌阵的战术和技术。
    从解放军阵地上隔海遥望，可以看到敌方波涛拍岸的黯灰色的泥滩上和海水中，一层层地排列着丛密的水上鹿柴、汽油筒爆炸物、照明物、高杆、屋脊形、铁丝网、梅花桩，以及夕阳下发着淡黄色的竹签和竹墙，在这些防御工事的后面，掩藏着成群的地堡和火力点，残匪把这些孤零零的岛屿，变成了一座座密密封锁的水城。
    针对着敌阵设防和兵力配备的情形，解放军普遍展开了敌前练兵运动。在积水数寸、泥深过脚的稻田里，在那疾风怒号、海涛澎湃的海滩上，在险陡难爬的山坡上，在每一个排以至每一个班的营房门前，都架设起形形色色的工事模型，开辟了无数的练兵场。白天可以看到一队队的指战员，操演着各种破除动作与队形。晚上，帆影掠过奔涛骇浪的海面，把步兵一群群地送上演习的登陆点，试验爆炸的声音彻夜在海面上和山谷里轰鸣。从炎夏到隆冬，指战员们反复地演习着、设想着各种各样的情况，在退潮时的泥滩上学会了动作，就研究在涨潮水深到胸膛时怎样的破除法，白天熟练了又在夜间练。在演习中，战士们有时把两腿冻得失去了知觉，有时又热得头脑发晕，演习完毕后睡下了，夜梦中还高呼着前进杀敌的口号。许多连长和指导员们，不得不在夜间去检查铺位，禁止战士们不顾健康的操练。解放军的指战员们，不仅是以传统的英勇，而且是以集体智慧的创造，把胜利掌握在自己的手里。人们走进了前线的部队，就像走进了智慧的海洋。
    前线某部曾举行一次盛大的渡海作战器材大检阅。数百个来自各部的指挥员、战斗员、炮兵、医务人员、担架员，携带着他们自己所创造的适于渡海作战的各种器材。“检阅台”是设置在一座临近海面的山头上，隔着一道海岸对岸就是敌人占踞的海岛，从望远镜里，可以极其清楚地看到敌军的阵形。而陈列在这里的一百数十种器材，正是用以摧毁和破坏对岸敌阵的利器。检阅的人们照样铺设了和敌阵配属完全一样的沙盘。每一件器材的创造者和发明家都挨次走上来当场试验他们的利器。某连连长冯云坡亲自率领着战士试验本连所创造的一种爆破器材。只见船只在连续的爆炸浓烟中冲进着，敌人的鹿柴、木桩、铁丝网、竹墙就一道一道地在船头被摧毁而腾飞起来。跃身下船的战士，在转眼间，已经持着刺刀逼进假设在岸头的地堡。
    无数人们的智慧和勇敢汇集在每一件器材的创造过程中。许多器材都要冒着生死的危险才能最后实验成功，但是指战员们表现了伟大科学家、发明家的创业精神，完成了这些伟大的发明。但是如果谁要想一一记下这些伟大的发明家和创业者的光辉的名字则是困难的，因为这些伟大的创造和发明常是上千上万英雄集体的智慧与血汗所凝成的。在整个敌前学习运动过程中，各部高级指挥员们举行了多次的军事会议，以集体研究求得战术思想的正确与一致。人民解放军就是这样艰苦紧张地创造了整套的渡海作战的战术和技术。
    随着时间的推移，人民解放军解放舟山的战前准备工作是一天天全面的接近于完成了。但是，他们牢记着毛主席的英明指示：“不打无准备的仗”，还是反复地不止一次地进行着检查，根据敌情新的变化去修正，去发展，要求作到十分正确和熟练。于是，各部各兵种又普遍地进行了大规模的联合演习，由上船、渡海、登陆、突破、巩固滩头阵地，直到纵深发展，步兵、水手、炮兵等各兵种的协同配合，海上与陆上的通讯联络等，都作了实地演习。
    记者曾参观了某部的一次演习。那是一个月夜，海上寂无声息。突然，一枚绿色曳光弹升到海空，大演习开始了。抬头远望，月光下，在浪涛奔腾的海面上，无数扬着白帆的战船疾驶而过。不一会，从那在变幻中的波光中跳荡的木船上，向岸上发出了枪炮的火舌。当船快到敌军防御工事前的霎那间，连声“隆隆”巨响，海水腾空而起，分不清是烟是雾，遮住了整个海滩。这时什么也看不见了，只有爆炸声、射击声在海上发出巨大的回响。当记者正惊愕时，一枚讯号弹划破天空，宣告演习的部队已在五分钟内占领了敌人的滩头阵地。
    就是这样，人民解放军舟山前线部队在长期的艰苦的战争准备工作过程中，时刻地抑制着自己满腔的迫切歼敌的战斗热情，克服着常人所不能忍受的肉体的疲劳和疾病，以及物质条件的困难，征服了大自然，打败了匪机匪舰轰炸和袭扰，识破了敌人的设防和战术，击败了敌人一切困守的妄想。在这种情况下，惧怕业已注定死亡的命运日益迫近的敌人，仓惶逃窜了。但是，人民解放军这次解放舟山的胜利绝对不是偶然的。人民解放军将在继续进行的战争准备工作中，为全国人民把解放台湾的最后胜利安排停当。
