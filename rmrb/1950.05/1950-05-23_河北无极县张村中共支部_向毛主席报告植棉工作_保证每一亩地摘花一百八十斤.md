　　Hebei Wuji County Zhang Village CCP Branch
　　Reports to Chairman Mao on Cotton Planting Work
　　Guaranteeing 180 Jin of Cotton Per Mu
　　[This newspaper, Wuji Dispatch] The Zhang Village CCP Branch in Wuji County, Hebei Province, reports to Chairman Mao and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP on cotton planting work. The original letter is as follows: To the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP, and forwarded to Chairman Mao:
　　Our village is a small village of 169 households, with 1,803 mu of land and a population of 729. 145 households have been organized into 63 mutual aid teams. The whole village has 39 waterwheels, 25 carts, and 133 head of livestock. Our village has a tradition of growing cotton. Last year, the government called for planting more cotton. The masses originally planned to plant 360 mu of cotton. Under the direct leadership of the CCP county and district committees, the 39 party members and 40+ cadres of our village patiently mobilized people door-to-door, street by street, and area by area, and promoted the planting of 713 mu of cotton throughout the village through the exemplary role of party members and cadres. Last year, the rainfall was heavy, and the Mudao Ditch flooded. Most of the cotton in our village was flooded. Party members and cadres led the masses to dig ditches to drain water and overcome the flood. Each mu of cotton field yielded 140 jin of cotton. The whole village harvested a total of 99,720 jin, which could be exchanged for more than 1,940 shi of millet, ensuring that the people of the whole village had adequate food and clothing. Last winter and this spring, the whole village added three waterwheels, two carts, and seventeen head of livestock. In addition, fourteen small livestock were exchanged for large livestock, fourteen old waterwheels were repaired, and eight old wells were repaired. The facts educated the masses and made them realize that planting cotton is beneficial to the country and to themselves. For example, Gu Luo's state-owned land was 18 mu, of which 8 mu were planted with cotton last year, yielding more than 1,200 jin of cotton. A small donkey was exchanged for a big mule, and a broken cart was exchanged for a good cart. Party member Li Lianfa planted 7 mu of cotton last year, yielding more than 900 jin of cotton, and bought a piece of homestead with 112 dou of millet.
　　Although the benefits of planting cotton last year were not small, the masses in the whole village were still worried about the flooding of the Mudao Ditch. Some people suspected that the price of cotton was unstable, and that planting too much cotton would lead to a shortage of food and fuel, and no grass to feed the livestock. When planting wheat last year, the CCP branch vigorously promoted leaving land for cotton planting. Especially in February this year, the district government assigned our village the task of planting 1,087 mu of cotton. The branch first held a meeting to discuss and dispel the masses' concerns, and guaranteed the completion of the cotton planting task. Afterwards, it held party member meetings, village representative meetings, citizen group meetings, and old peasant forums to conduct in-depth propaganda and mobilization, and conveyed and discussed the cotton planting task. It explained that the government had dredged and built dikes on the Mudao Ditch this year, which could prevent floods, and educated the masses with the experience of overcoming floods last year, dispelling the masses' concerns about flooding. It publicized the government's cotton price policy and advocated burning coal, dispelling the masses' concerns about planting too much cotton and not having enough food and firewood. It advocated intercropping millet in wheat fields and leaving open land for planting cotton. Under the leadership of party members, cadres, and labor model cotton-growing activists, the whole village planted cotton on a total of 217.7 mu of land, including 154.5 mu of land originally planned for sorghum and 117.2 mu of land for millet. Now the whole village has planted 1,107.7 mu of cotton, accounting for more than 61% of the village's land, exceeding the original assigned task by 20.7 mu.
　　During the cotton planting season, it rained thoroughly. The CCP branch immediately tried to solve the problem of cotton seed shortage for the masses and mobilized the masses to borrow and exchange mutually. Branch secretary Li Xinqi lent 135 jin of cotton seed to Zhao Xiaoqing and other seven households, solving the cotton seed problem for 27 mu of land. Finally, the whole village was still short of 355 jin of cotton seed, which was immediately loaned to the masses by the supply and marketing cooperative. In order to successfully complete the cotton planting task, the party member congress of the whole village decided to challenge the branches of all villages in the county. We first planted 9 mu of cotton for three military families lacking labor. The branch put forward the slogan of "three fasts and five not idles." The three fasts are: party members plant fast, guarantee that the masses plant fast, and the whole village completes the sowing work quickly; the five not idles are: people, livestock, hoes, harrows, and seeders are not idle. The 63 mutual aid teams in the whole village completed the cotton sowing work in four days of intensive work.
　　In order to ensure the increase in cotton production, we held a forum for experienced farmers to discuss ways to increase production. The best ways are to apply more fertilizer, hoe five times, repair diligently, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests. When the cotton blooms, if it is dry and does not rain, irrigate it several times to ensure that each mu yields 180 jin of cotton. We wish our dear Chairman Mao and the comrades of the Provincial Committee good health!

　　河北无极县张村中共支部
    向毛主席报告植棉工作   
    保证每一亩地摘花一百八十斤
    【本报无极讯】河北省无极县张村中共支部，向毛主席暨中共河北省委员会报告种棉工作，原函如下：中共河北省委员会并转毛主席：
    俺村是一百六十九户的一个小村，有地一千八百零三亩，人七百二十九口，已有一百四十五户组织起来，共组织了六十三个互助小组。全村有三十九辆水车，二十五辆大车，一百三十三头牲口。俺村过去有种棉习惯，去年政府号召多种棉花，群众原计划种棉三百六十亩，在中共县、区委的直接领导下，俺村三十九个党员和四十多个干部，分街、分片挨门逐户耐心动员，并以党员、干部的模范带头作用，推动全村种棉七百一十三亩。去年雨水很大，木刀沟里又发了水，俺村大部棉花被淹，党员、干部领导群众挖沟泄水，战胜了水灾，每亩棉田摘棉一百四十斤，全村共摘花九万九千七百二十斤，能换小米一千九百四十多石，保证了全村人民丰衣足食。去冬今春全村增添水车三架，大车两辆，牲口十七头，另有用小牲口换成大牲口的十四头，修理旧水车十四辆，修理旧井八眼。事实教育了群众，知道种棉对国家对自己都有利。例如：谷洛国有地十八亩，去年种棉八亩，摘花一千二百多斤，小驴换成了大骡子，破车换成了好车。党员李连发，去年种棉七亩，摘花九百多斤，用一百一十二斗小米买了一块庄基。
    虽去年种棉得利不小，但全村群众对木刀沟发水，尚有顾虑；部分群众怀疑棉价不稳，多种棉怕缺吃少烧，没有喂牲口的草。中共支部在去年种麦时，曾大力宣传留棉田。特别在今年二月间，区政府分配俺村种一千零八十七亩棉花的任务，支部首先开会讨论，解除群众顾虑，保证种棉任务的完成。随后又开了党员大会、村代表会、公民小组会、老农座谈会等，进行了深入的宣传动员，传达讨论了种棉任务。说明今年政府已对木刀沟进行了疏浚筑堤，可以防止水患，并以去年战胜水灾的经验教育群众，解除了群众怕发水的顾虑。宣传政府的棉价政策，并提倡烧煤，解除了群众怕种棉多没粮食没柴烧的想法。提倡麦田兼作谷子，留出白地种棉，在党员、干部、劳动模范种棉积极户的带动下，全村将原计划种高粱的一百五十四亩半地，种谷子的一百一十七亩二分地共二百一十七亩七分地种上了棉花。现在全村种棉一千一百零七亩七分，占全村土地百分之六十一强，超过原分配任务二十亩七分。
    种棉季节中，天落透雨，中共支部曾立即设法解决群众棉籽困难，发动群众互借互换。支部书记李新启借给了赵小轻等七户一百三十五斤棉籽，解决了二十七亩地的棉籽困难。最后全村还缺三百五十五斤棉籽，立即由供销社贷给了群众。为了胜利完成种棉任务，全村党员大会决定向全县各村支部进行挑战。俺们先给缺劳动力的三户军属种上棉花九亩。支部提出三快五不闲的口号，三快是：党员种得快，保证群众种得快，全村播种工作完成得快；五不闲是：人、牲口、耠、耙、耧都不闲。全村六十三个互助组，经四天的突击，完成了棉花播种工作。
    俺们为了保证棉花的增产，曾召开了老农座谈会，讨论增产办法。最好的办法是多使肥、锄五遍、勤修理、防病治虫。在棉开花时，如天旱不雨，就多浇两次，保证每亩摘花一百八十斤。祝亲爱的毛主席和省委会同志们健康！
