　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The China Democratic League has sent a telegram expressing support for Professor Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, and protesting against the French government's dismissal of him from the post of High Commissioner for Atomic Energy. The telegram reads:

　　To Professor Joliot-Curie:

　　Because you are a leader of the world peace movement, because you are the initiator and first signatory of the appeal demanding an unconditional ban on atomic weapons and advocating that governments that use atomic weapons first should be considered war criminals, and because the majority of peace-loving people around the world warmly support your just demands, the warmongers are jealous of you. They instigated the French government to dismiss you from your positions as High Commissioner for Atomic Energy and member of the Atomic Energy Commission. The persecution you have suffered symbolizes the threat to world "peace"! We strongly protest this absurd measure by the reactionary French government. At the same time, we have a clearer understanding of the hideous faces of the Bidaults and their masters. We, the people of all of China, will certainly rise up together to consolidate our ranks, be your strong and vast rear guard, and fight to defend lasting world peace!

　　中国民主同盟声援居里教授
    【新华社九日讯】中国民主同盟顷致电声援世界拥护和平大会常设委员会主席约里奥·居里教授，并抗议法国政府解除他的原子能高级专员的职务。电称：约里奥·居里教授：
    由于你是世界和平运动的领导者，由于你是要求无条件禁止原子武器并主张把首先使用原子武器的政府认为战犯的呼吁书的倡导者和第一个签名者，由于全世界大多数爱好和平的人民都热烈地拥护你的正义主张，于是战争贩子们嫉恨你，他们嗾使法国政府免除了你的原子能高级专员和原子能委员会委员职务。你所受的迫害，象征着世界“和平”所受的威胁！我们对法国反动政府的这一荒谬措施，提出严重抗议。同时我们更认识了皮杜尔辈及其主子们的狰狞面目。我们全中国的人民定将一致奋起整饬阵容，做你的坚强广大的后援军，为保卫世界持久和平而斗争！
