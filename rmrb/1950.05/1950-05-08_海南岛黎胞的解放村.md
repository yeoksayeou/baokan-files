　　The Liberated Village of the Li People on Hainan Island
　　When the vanguard battalion of the People's Liberation Army successfully landed on Hainan Island in March, the bandit troops mobilized a division to attack the liberated areas, engaging in arson, murder, and looting everywhere. When the bandit troops passed through Banana Village in Fulong Township, Baisha County, a village inhabited by only fourteen Li households, they found no grain and no people. Enraged by this, they set fire to all the houses in the village, smashed all the stoves and belongings, and felled all the banana trees surrounding the village.
　　When the vanguard battalion, in coordination with the Qiongya fraternal troops, defeated the bandit troops and arrived in the Fulong Township area, they saw that the Li people of Banana Village were homeless and immediately sent a company to rebuild their homes. The commanders and fighters, carrying shovels and axes, immediately began to rebuild houses on the land ravaged by the bandit troops. The soldiers took off their clothes in the scorching sun to cut bamboo, gather firewood, erect beams, and cut grass. They also launched competitions during their work, mutually guaranteeing to build neat and solid houses for the Li people. Many had their fingers cut by thatch; some had bodies covered in sweat and stained with dust, as if coated with soot; but no one complained, and they all worked tirelessly. When the Li people returned from the deep mountains carrying animal skins, straw mats, iron pots, and bowls and chopsticks, the dilapidated village had been completely renewed, with rows of houses appearing. They were so moved that they didn't know what to do. An elderly Li man said, "The Kuomintang come to burn houses, the People's Liberation Army come to build houses. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can our Li people stand up!" The Li women, while busy boiling water for the soldiers, watched their new homes with smiles. All the villagers unanimously requested the People's Liberation Army to move into their village. Many people stuffed cooked eggs into the soldiers' pockets.
　　A month later, a large-scale landing began. The main force of the People's Liberation Army passed through Banana Village again. The Li people vied to tell the commanders and fighters the story of how the Second Company of the vanguard battalion built houses for them. By this time, the village was no longer called Banana Village; they had given it a new name: Liberated Village.

### 海南岛黎胞的解放村

　　海南岛黎胞的解放村
    当三月间人民解放军某部先锋营登陆海南岛成功后，匪军曾调集一个师的兵力进攻解放区，到处烧杀掳掠。匪军经过白沙县阜龙乡一个只有十四户黎胞的芭蕉村时，找不到一颗粮食和一个人，大发兽性，放火烧毁了全村的房舍，捣碎所有灶锅和什物，村庄周围的芭蕉树全被砍倒。
    当先锋营配合琼崖兄弟部队击退匪军来到阜龙乡一带时，眼看芭蕉村黎胞无家可归，立即派出一个连为黎胞重建该村家园。指战员们带上铁锹、斧头，在被匪军蹂躏的土地上立即动工重建房舍。战士们在烈日下脱光衣服去砍竹、打柴、架梁、割草，工作中还发动竞赛，互相保证要替黎胞盖起整洁而结实的房子来。许多人被茅草割破手指；有的满是汗水的身体粘染了灰尘，好似涂了一层煤烟；但没有一个人叫苦，都在手脚不停地劳动着。当黎胞们从深山里挑着兽皮，草席、铁锅、碗筷回来时，残破的村庄已经焕然一新，出现了一列列的房屋。他们感动得不知怎样是好。一位年老的黎胞说：“国民党来烧房子，解放军来盖房子。只有在共产党的领导下，我们黎人才能翻身！”黎胞妇女们一面忙着烧开水给战士们喝，一面笑嬉嬉地注视着自己的新的家园。全村黎胞们一致要求解放军搬到他们村子来住。很多人把煮好的鸡蛋塞进战士们的衣袋里。
    一个月后，大规模的登陆开始了。解放军的主力部队又经过芭蕉村。黎胞们争着向指战员叙述先锋营第二连替他们盖房子的故事。这时这个村子已经不叫做芭蕉村了，他们已经给它换上了一个新名字：解放村。
