Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th -- The production volume of some factories and mines in Chongqing has significantly increased compared to pre-liberation levels. Following the abolition of the contracting system, the establishment of "brotherhood teams," and wage adjustments, the daily output of the Tianfu Coal Mining Company, the largest in Southwest China, increased by 20% in April compared to pre-liberation levels. The Quanji and Heping coal mines saw increases of 35% to 85% compared to pre-liberation levels, exceeding the historical peak records of both mines. In the city's thirteen private textile factories, due to workers actively consulting with capitalists, abolishing body searches, adjusting wage-in-kind standards, and reasonably resolving bonus and award issues, production has increased across the board. Among them, the Daming and Shashi yarn factories set new records for production and raw material conservation. Compared to the highest pre-liberation output, Daming Yarn Factory's yarn production in March exceeded by 10.8%, and cloth production exceeded by 17.3%. In March, Shashi Yarn Factory not only overfulfilled its production plan but also saved 15% on raw cotton and electricity.

　　重庆市部分厂矿生产
　　超过解放前最高水平
    【新华社重庆十二日电】重庆市部分厂矿的生产量比解放前已有显著提高。由于取消了包工制，建立了兄弟班，调整了工资，西南区最大的天府煤矿公司四月份每天的产量比解放前增加了百分之二十；全济、和平两煤矿比解放前提高百分之三十五到百分之八十五，超过了两矿历年的最高纪录。全市十三家私营纺织厂，由于工人主动地与资方协商，废除了抄身制，调整了工资折实标准，合理解决了花红奖金问题，产量均有增加。其中大明、沙市两纱厂并创造了产量和节省原料的新纪录。和解放前最高产量比，大明纱厂三月份纱的产量超过百分之十点八，布的产量超过百分之十七点三。沙市纱厂三月份不仅超额完成了生产计划，并节省了原棉和百分之十五的电力。
