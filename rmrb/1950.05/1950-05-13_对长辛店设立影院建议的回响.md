　　Response to the Suggestion of Establishing a Cinema in Changxindian
　　Editor:
　　We strongly agree with the suggestion made by four comrades from the Training Corps in the People's Garden on May 8th to establish a theater in Changxindian. Indeed, in this industrial area with a population of over 30,000, a theater should be established according to the needs of the masses. However, the district government and local citizens do not currently have the resources to establish a theater. If anyone is willing to come to Changxindian to open a theater or cinema, we welcome them. We hope that people from all walks of life who are willing to come and establish a theater or cinema will come to negotiate, and we will provide assistance as much as possible.

### 对长辛店设立影院建议的回响

　　对长辛店设立影院建议的回响编辑同志：
    在五月八日人民园地上看到教导团四位同志建议要在长辛店设立戏院，我们对这个建议非常同意。的确，在这个三万多人口的工业区，按群众的要求，是应该设立的。但是现在区政府和当地市民都没有力量来设立戏院。如果有人愿意到长辛店来开戏院或电影院，我们是欢迎的。希望各界人士，愿前来设立戏院或影院者，前来洽商，我们当尽可能加以帮助。
