Southern Anhui Solves Middle School Enrollment Difficulties
    Almost All Students From Last Semester Have Returned to School
    [Our Wuhu News] Correspondent Wang Ying reports: At the beginning of this semester, a large number of students in secondary schools in the Southern Anhui region were slow to enroll. After the schools made great efforts in ideological mobilization and took appropriate measures to solve the economic difficulties of some students, basically all students who were enrolled in the previous semester have been persuaded to return to school.
    The situation of students being late to enroll was very serious at the beginning of this semester. For example, one week after the start of school at Qingyang Normal School, only 47% of the students from the end of the previous semester had arrived; only 30% at Ningguo Middle School; and less than 20% at Jingde Middle School.
    Several Erroneous Ideas Hinder Students' Enrollment
    The reasons for students not attending school, apart from a few who participated in work, were admitted to cadre schools, or had economic difficulties, the vast majority were hindered by several abnormal ideas. For example, some landlords stopped their children from enrolling or delayed their enrollment to pretend to be poor and complain; or they lost interest in sending their children to school, thinking that sending their children to school could no longer be for the family's benefit, but would instead turn against them. Some landlord's children were also infected with the family's decline and lost their ambition. Some rich peasant children also had the above situation because they did not yet understand the land reform policy. Some industrialists and merchants in the city stopped their children from attending school to show that they had "no money," hoping to evade taxes and public bonds. In addition, a very small number of students used not attending school as a "condition" to demand people's scholarships from the school; and there were also individual students who worried about the Kuomintang coming back, fearing that "attending a Communist school would cause trouble in the future."
    In response to the above situation, the Southern Anhui Administrative Office urgently instructed all schools to point out the solutions: to open up the minds of students and parents; to properly evaluate people's scholarships; and to vigorously save and organize spare-time production.
    Teachers and Students Go Deep to Persuade Students to Enroll
    To this end, all schools held special meetings to discuss and study ways to mobilize students to enroll. Teachers and students at school mobilized students who had not enrolled by writing letters and making home visits. For students whose economic situation was indeed more difficult, the slogan of "production to assist education" was put forward. At the same time, all schools took some measures to reduce the burden on students: such as appropriately lowering food standards; stipulating installment payment methods; and lending textbooks or printing lecture notes by the school or old classmates to reduce book costs.
    After this mobilization, according to statistics from 24 schools, the number of students enrolled has reached 94.9% of the number at the end of the previous semester. Basically, all students who stayed at home have been persuaded to return to school.
    Appropriately Increase the Number of Scholarships and Organize Spare-Time Production Such as Planting Vegetables
    After the students entered the school, all schools seriously evaluated the people's scholarships. The number of scholarships in ordinary middle schools was increased from 8% to 12%; and in normal schools and vocational schools, it was increased from 50% to 70%, which solved the difficulties of the truly poor students in each school. Then, all schools started spare-time production, and some have achieved considerable results. Spare-time production is mainly planting vegetables, generally planned to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables, followed by raising pigs and fish. Some schools also used convenient conditions to organize students to chop firewood, pick tea, spin yarn, and sew. Due to these measures, some schools can maintain five months of food with only three and a half months of rice compared to the previous semester. The burden on students has been reduced, and their learning mood has improved accordingly.
    Deviations Occur in Some Schools
    However, some schools had deviations in mobilizing students to enroll, such as lowering the level of students' enrollment, indiscriminately recruiting transfer students, or inappropriately allowing some students who did not meet the requirements to enjoy people's scholarships. In the evaluation of people's scholarships, some individual schools also adopted the wrong method of distributing scholarships equally. In terms of saving, some schools excessively lowered food standards, affecting students' health. In the organization of spare-time production, many schools did not adopt the principle of "distribution according to work" and develop mutual assistance on the basis of students' voluntariness, but used administrative orders to use the production of all students to solve the difficulties of a few students or only to subsidize the food of boarding students, which made some students who worked without gain feel dissatisfied, affecting the production mood. These are being gradually corrected.

### 皖南解决中学生入学困难  上期学生基本上已全部到校

　　皖南解决中学生入学困难
    上期学生基本上已全部到校
    【本报芜湖讯】通讯员王影报道：皖南区各中等学校本期开学之初曾发生大部学生迟迟不入学的现象，经过各校大力进行思想动员和采取适当办法解决一部分学生的经济困难后，基本上已争取到上学期就学的学生全部入校。
    本期开学后学生迟不入学的情况很严重。如青阳师范开学后一星期，到校学生只有上期末人数的百分之四十七；宁国中学仅百分之三十；旌德中学尚不及百分之二十。
    几种错误思想阻碍学生上学
    学生不到校的原因，除一部分是参加了工作、考入干部学校学习或经济困难者外，绝大多数却是受了几种不正常的思想的阻碍。如某些地主，以停止子弟入学或拖延其入学来装穷叫苦；或则丧失了送子弟读书的兴趣，认为送子弟上学已不能再为家庭打算，反会转而反对自己。有的地主子弟也感染了家庭没落情绪，丧失了上进心。某些富农子弟，因尚不明了土地改革政策，也有上述情形。城市中某些工商户，以停止子弟上学来表示其“无钱”，希图逃避税收、公债。此外，还有极少数学生以不入学来作向学校要求人民助学金的“条件”；也有个别的担心国民党再来，怕“上了共产党的学校将来麻烦”的。
    针对上述情况，皖南行署曾紧急指示各校，指出解决的方法：打通学生及家长思想；评好人民助学金；大力节约与组织课余生产。
    教师同学深入劝学
    各校为此都召开了专门会议，讨论研究动员学生入学的办法。由教师与在校学生以写信、作家庭访问等方式，动员未入校学生入学。对经济情况确较困难的学生，则提出了“生产助学”的口号。同时，各校采取了一些减轻学生负担的措施：如适当地降低伙食标准；订分期收费办法；由学校或老同学借给课本或印发讲义，以减少书籍费用等。
    经过此次动员，据二十四个学校统计，入学人数已达上期结束时人数的百分之九十四点九。基本上已争取留家学生全部入校。
    适当增加助学金名额组织种菜等课余生产
    学生入校之后，各校又认真评议了人民助学金。助学金名额，普通中学由百分之八增至百分之十二；师范学校及职业学校由百分之五十增至百分之七十，解决了各校真正贫苦学生的困难。接着，各校又开始了课余生产，有的已获相当成绩。课余生产主要是种蔬菜，一般是计划作到蔬菜自给，其次是养猪、养鱼等。有的学校并利用便利条件，组织学生打柴、采茶、摇纱、缝纫等。由于这些办法，有的学校和上期比较，仅收三个半月的膳米即能维持五个月伙食。减轻了学生负担，学习情绪都随之提高。
    部分学校发生偏向
    但部分学校在动员学生入学中曾产生偏向，例如降低学生入学程度、滥招插班生或不适当地允许一些不够条件的学生享受人民助学金。在评议人民助学金中，也有个别学校采用了平均分配助学金的错误方法。在节约方面，有的学校过度地降低伙食标准，影响了学生健康。在组织课余生产中，许多学校不是采用“按劳分红”的原则并在学生自愿的基础上展开互助，而以行政命令方式将全校学生的生产用来解决少数学生困难或仅用来补助住校学生的伙食，使一部分劳而不获的学生感到不满，影响了生产情绪。这些，已在逐步纠正中。
