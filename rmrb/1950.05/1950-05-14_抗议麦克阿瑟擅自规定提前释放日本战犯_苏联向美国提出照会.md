　　Protest Against MacArthur's Unauthorized Provision for Early Release of Japanese War Criminals
　　Soviet Union Submits Note to United States
    Points out that MacArthur's action is a reckless violation of international law and firmly demands the immediate revocation of his illegal Directive No. 5
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 13th] The Soviet Government, through its embassy in the United States, delivered a note to the United States government on May 11th, protesting against MacArthur's violation of the Far East International Military Tribunal's judgment by unilaterally stipulating that Japanese war criminals could be released before the end of their sentences. A copy of the note has been submitted by the Soviet Embassy in our country to the Central People's Government of China, and has also been submitted to the governments of other member states of the Far Eastern Commission: Australia, Burma, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, India, Canada, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, and France.
    The Soviet Government's note to the United States Government is as follows:
    "The Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, under the instructions of the Soviet Government, hereby informs the United States Department of State of the following:
    On March 7th of this year, General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, issued Directive No. 5, stipulating that all war criminals currently serving sentences in Japan, based on judgments, may be released before the end of their sentences.
    As is well known, among those serving sentences in Japan are sixteen major Japanese war criminals who were sentenced to imprisonment by the Far East International Military Tribunal for committing the most serious crimes against humanity.
    The Supreme Commander's directive is an attempt, through a unilateral order, to exempt the major Japanese criminals from the execution of their sentences as determined by the judgments, which have already come into legal effect in the international court. Representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and the Philippines participated in that international court. The Supreme Commander's action aims to alter or completely abolish the agreement of the international court established under the agreement between the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China. The United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China authorized the aforementioned court to decide the punishment of major Japanese war criminals guilty of committing the most serious crimes against humanity. Therefore, the Supreme Commander's action is a reckless violation of the fundamental norms and principles of international law.
    According to Article 17 of the Statute of the International Military Tribunal and Section 2, Paragraph "B" of the Far Eastern Commission's resolution of April 3, 1946, "Concerning the Arrest, Trial and Punishment of Far Eastern War Criminals," the Supreme Commander is only authorized to mitigate or otherwise alter the judgments submitted by the International Court when considering the issue of recognizing such judgments. Neither the Statute of the International Military Tribunal nor the aforementioned resolution of the Far Eastern Commission contains any provision sufficient to empower the Supreme Commander to mitigate or in any way alter the judgment after it has been recognized and submitted for execution.
    The judgments submitted by the International Military Tribunal against Araki Sadao, Hiranuma Kiichirō, Shigemitsu Mamoru, and the other thirteen defendants were endorsed by the Supreme Commander after consultation with the Allied Council for Japan and with the representatives of other nations serving as members of the Far Eastern Commission. On November 24, 1948, the Supreme Commander announced the endorsement of the International Military Tribunal's judgments against the aforementioned major Japanese war criminals. The Supreme Commander also stated that he had not found any omissions sufficient to justify amending this judgment. By endorsing the judgments of the International Military Tribunal, the Supreme Commander could no longer exercise the authority granted to him by the Statute of the Far East International Military Tribunal and the Far Eastern Commission's political resolution of April 3, 1946, "Concerning the Arrest, Trial and Punishment of Far Eastern War Criminals," to amend the aforementioned judgments submitted by the International Military Tribunal. By issuing the aforementioned directive, he exceeded his privileges as strictly limited by the relevant international laws, such as the Statute of the International Military Tribunal and the articles of the Far Eastern Commission's political resolution of April 3, 1946, "Concerning the Arrest, Trial and Punishment of Far Eastern War Criminals."
    The Soviet Government reminds the United States Government of General MacArthur's aforementioned action, which violates the agreement reached by the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and other participating countries of the International Tribunal regarding the establishment of the Far East International Military Tribunal, and violates the Statute of the Far East International Tribunal and the Far Eastern Commission's resolution of April 3, 1946. The Soviet Government firmly demands that the United States Government take immediate measures without delay to revoke the aforementioned illegal Directive No. 5 of March 7 of this year concerning the major Japanese war criminals who have already been judged by the Far East International Military Tribunal."

### 抗议麦克阿瑟擅自规定提前释放日本战犯　苏联向美国提出照会

　　抗议麦克阿瑟擅自规定提前释放日本战犯
　　苏联向美国提出照会
    指出麦克阿瑟的行动是胡乱违背国际公法坚决要求立即撤销他的非法的第五号指令
    【新华社十三日讯】苏联政府经由其驻美国大使馆，于五月十一日向美国政府致送照会一件，抗议麦克阿瑟违反远东国际军事法庭的判决而擅自规定可在刑期终了前释放日本战犯。该照会副本已由苏联驻我国大使馆递交我国中央人民政府，亦已递交远东委员会其他会员国——澳大利亚、缅甸、英国、荷兰、印度、加拿大、纽西兰、巴基斯坦、菲律宾和法国的政府。
    苏联政府致美国政府的照会如下：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟大使馆，奉苏联政府的训令，谨以下列各节通知美国国务院：
    本年三月七日，驻日盟军最高统帅麦克阿瑟将军，颁发了第五号指令，规定：凡根据判决书，目前在日本执行受刑期的一切战犯们，皆可在刊期终了以前予以释放。
    如所周知，在日本执行受刑期的，有因为对人类犯了最重大的罪行，被远东国际军事法庭判处徒刊的十六名日本主要战犯。
    最高统帅的指令，乃是企图凭借片面的命令，使日本主要罪犯们免受判决书所决定的他们的刑期的执行，那种判决书已发生国际法庭的法律上的效力，苏联、美国、英国、法国、中国、荷兰、加拿大、澳大利亚、纽西兰、印度、菲律宾的代表们，都曾参加那个国际法庭。最高统帅的这种行动，目的在于变更、或者完全取消根据美国、英国、苏联和中国之间的协议而设置的国际法庭的协定，美国、英国、苏联和中国曾授权上述法庭来决定因为对人类犯了最重大的罪行而有罪的，日本主要战犯们的治罪法，所以，最高统帅的这种行动，实属胡乱违背国际公法的基本常规和原则。
    根据国际军事法庭法规第十七条，并根据远东委员会于一九四六年四月三日“关于逮捕、审判和惩处远东战犯”的决议第五节第二条“乙”款，只是在考虑关于认可这种判决书的问题时，最高统帅才有权减轻、或以任何其他方式变更国际法庭所提出的判决书。国际法庭的法规、或上述远东委员会的决议，都不含有任何规定足以使最高统帅在该判决书已被认可并提交执行之后，有权减轻或以任何方式变更该判决书。
    国际军事法庭对荒木贞夫、平沼骐一郎、重光葵以及其他十三名被告所提出的判决书，在最高统帅与盟国对日管制委员会并与担任远东委员会委员的其他国家的代表商讨以后，曾获得最高统帅的认可。一九四八年十一月二十四日，最高统帅宣布认可国际军事法庭对上述日本主要战犯的判决书。最高统帅同时声明，他并未发现有任何疏漏之处，足以成为修改此项判决书的理由。由于认可了国际军事法庭的判决书，最高统帅就不能再行使远东国际军事法庭法规和远东委员会一九四六年四月三日的决议所赋予他的关于修改上述国际军事法庭提出的判决书的职权。最高统帅因为颁发上述的指令，他就超越了相应的国际法令，如国际军事法庭法规以及远东委员会一九四六年四月三日“关于逮捕、审判和惩处远东战犯”的政治决议等条款所严格限制的他的特权。
    苏联政府提醒美国政府注意麦克阿瑟将军上述的行动，此种行动违背了苏联、美国、英国、中国以及国际法庭其他参与国所达成的关于设立远东国际军事法庭的协定，并违反了远东国际法庭法规和远东委员会一九四六年四月三日的决议。苏联政府坚决要求美国政府毫不延迟地立即采取措施，撤销上述本年三月七日关于已由远东国际军事法庭判决的日本主要战犯的非法的第五号指令。”
