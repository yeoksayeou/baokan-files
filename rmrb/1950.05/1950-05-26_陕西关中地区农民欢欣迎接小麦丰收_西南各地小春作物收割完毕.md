Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 25th: The rural areas of Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, are currently filled with joyous harvest sounds. On the Guanzhong Plain, from Tongguan to Baoji, from the foothills of the Zhongnan Mountains to the areas of Hancheng and Heshui in northern Shaanxi, more than 20 million mu of wheat will achieve a harvest unseen in the past twenty years. This year, Guanzhong experienced ample spring rains, and the wheat seedlings grew vigorously. Now, the wheat stalks are as high as four feet, with large ears full of grain. The largest ears have as many as ninety-four grains. Local farmers estimate that the yield per mu could reach seven or eight dou (double market dou, same below), with the highest reaching one shi (double market shi). According to an old farmer, "I've lived for sixty or seventy years and have never seen such complete crops this year." In addition, rapeseed in the Sanyuan and Xianyang areas is estimated to yield an average of five dou per mu. The barley harvest will also greatly exceed previous years.

To welcome this abundant summer harvest, farmers in Guanzhong are actively preparing sickles, brooms, carts, and livestock. "Busy Farming Fairs" (special gatherings for selling agricultural tools) are being held everywhere, and the scale of farmers purchasing agricultural tools and livestock is unprecedented in many years. To this end, local people's governments have also instructed cooperatives to vigorously supply farmers with urgently needed agricultural tools, and loans can be provided to individual farmers who are unable to purchase them. The Northwest Cooperative Bureau Supply and Marketing Station has purchased 15,000 sickles and distributed them to cooperatives in various counties for sale.

In order to ensure the victorious completion of the summer harvest, the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the Shaanxi Provincial Government have issued orders requiring governments at all levels to concentrate their efforts and seize the time to lead farmers in the summer harvest. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has also recently issued instructions calling on Communist Party members to organize and assist farmers in the summer harvest to ensure its smooth completion. The Chang'an County Democratic Women's Federation has also launched a publicity campaign to mobilize and educate rural women to participate in harvesting, threshing, and other labor to supplement the shortage of male labor.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 25th: The harvesting of spring crops (including wheat, peas, broad beans, rapeseed, etc.) in rural areas of various parts of Southwest China has largely ended. Except for some areas in western Sichuan that were disturbed by bandits and individual areas in Yunnan that were affected by frost damage, with only 60% of the harvest, the harvest in most other areas is more than 80%, exceeding the level of 1949. The famine in Wushan, Taikou and other counties in eastern Sichuan has been lifted due to the bumper spring harvest.

　　陕西关中地区农民欢欣迎接小麦丰收
    西南各地小春作物收割完毕
    【新华社西安二十五日电】陕西关中地区农村中正洋溢着一片欢愉的丰收声。从潼关到宝鸡、从终南山麓到陕北韩城、郃阳一带的关中平原上，二千余万亩小麦将获得二十年来未有的丰收。今年关中春雨充足，麦苗生长茂盛，现在麦棵高达四尺，穗大籽满，最大的每穗有麦粒九十四粒。每亩产量据当地农民估计可达七、八斗（双市斗，下同），最高可达一石（双市石）。据一老农说：“我活了六七十岁，都没见过今年这样齐全的庄稼”。此外，三原、咸阳一带的油菜子估计平均每亩可收五斗。大麦收获量亦将大大超过往年。
    为着迎接这一丰满的夏收，关中农民正积极地准备镰刀、扫帚、大车和牲畜。刻各地纷纷举行“忙农会”（专卖农具的集会），会上农民购买农具牲畜的盛况为多年来所未有。各地人民政府为此亦责成合作社大力供应农民迫切需要的农具，如个别农民无力购买并可贷放。西北合作局供销栈已购得镰刀一万五千把，分发各县合作社出售。
    为了保证胜利完成夏收，西北军政委员会、陕西省政府均已发出命令，要求各级政府集中全力抓紧时间领导农民夏收。中共陕西省委亦于最近发出指示，号召共产党员组织和协助农民夏收，以保证夏收的顺利完成。长安县民主妇联，亦已展开宣传，动员和教育农村妇女参加收割、打场等劳动，以补助男劳动力的不足。
    【新华社重庆二十五日电】西南各地农村小春作物（包括小麦、豌豆、蚕豆、油菜子等）的收割，已经大部结束。除川西部分地区因曾遭土匪骚扰，云南个别地区因受冻灾影响，仅收六成外，其他大部地区的收获均在八成以上，超过一九四九年的水平。川东巫山、泰节等县的灾荒，因小春丰收已告解除。
