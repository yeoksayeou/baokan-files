　　The cultural publishing and distribution work of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army and the Central South Military Region has become a powerful weapon for promoting the development of the army's work and conducting ideological and cultural education. At present, more than 100 kinds of newspapers, magazines, picture albums, etc., are published by political organs at the division level and above throughout the army, with a circulation of hundreds of thousands of copies. Some units also publish regimental and company newspapers. The three publications published by the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army alone, "Political Work," "Soldier's Life," and "Frontline Pictorial," have a monthly circulation of more than 100,000 copies. In addition to newspapers and magazines, the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army and various units often publish various series, pamphlets, and special issues in conjunction with each work and combat mission. In the second half of 1949, the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army published more than 20 kinds of literary and political series and propaganda posters, with a total circulation of more than 400,000 copies. These publications played a huge role in inspiring the fighting will of the soldiers and promoting the work of the troops, and became a very important tool in the political work of the troops.
　　In the early stage of the Liberation War in 1946, the cultural and educational work of the troops began with the construction of the troops. At that time, the leading organs pointed out that newspaper work should be completed as an important political work task, and many responsible personnel in the troops personally participated in newspaper work and writing. Many newspaper workers demonstrated a high degree of work enthusiasm in the war environment. During the day, they marched with the troops in the ice and snow, carrying mimeograph machines on their backs. After the troops rested at night, they had to continue working until late at night. They could only rest for three or four hours a day to ensure that the newspapers could be published in a timely and uninterrupted manner. During combat, they moved the "editorial office" and "printing factory" to the shelters on the front lines, and used small newspapers in the form of frontline briefings to quickly spread many victory news and combat examples of their own army and friendly forces to every commander and fighter in the trenches. During training, they worked day and night regardless of fatigue, and newspapers were delivered to the troops almost every day. Many newspaper editors, reporters, and mimeograph operators made meritorious service just like combat personnel.
　　Because of all these efforts, the army's newspapers have a very close relationship with the soldiers and masses. An ordinary division's newspaper can receive hundreds or even nearly a thousand articles written by commanders and fighters every month, including various experience summaries, news reports, communications praising typical models, and poetry creations. With these lively and vivid contents, the newspaper played a role in guiding and promoting the work of the troops in a timely manner. In particular, the company newspaper is the most important part of the army's cultural publishing work. Before crossing the river last year, a certain unit launched a mass movement to run company newspapers, which greatly encouraged the progressive thinking in the troops and greatly helped the soldiers' cultural learning. The leading cadres of the company believe that the company newspaper is a very good tool to help the work of the troops.
　　In terms of magazines, "Political Work" and "Soldier's Life" published by the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army are very popular. Many cadres regard them as powerful assistants in their work and often carry them with them. When "Soldier's Life" was distributed to the company, the soldiers scrambled to read it. Whether marching or fighting, as long as they rested, they would ask the cultural instructors to read it to them. Many articles in "Soldier's Life" have become teaching materials for the company.
　　The distribution of publications in the army is a very important part of cultural publishing work. At present, the distribution work of the Fourth Field Army has developed from a decentralized and guerrilla-like method to a regular military postal service. The Political Department of the Fourth Field Army has a military postal office, the corps has a military postal office, and each army, division, and regiment has a military postal bureau and branch bureau. Each unit dispatches a certain number of personnel and transportation (such as cars and horses) to be specifically responsible for transportation work. Through the military postal work in the army, hundreds of thousands of publications are delivered to the front-line troops every month. Many people and vehicles responsible for transportation work under extremely difficult conditions, completing this arduous task as if they were completing a combat mission. During the war, in addition to completing the task of distributing newspapers to the troops, the military postal service also forwarded a large number of family letters from commanders and fighters from the front to the rear every month, and sent family letters from the rear to the front. According to statistics, from July to November last year, a total of more than 1.4 million pieces of family letters were received and forwarded. Now the military postal office has launched registered mail, and will launch parcel mail and remittance services.

　　四野的文化出版工作
　　推动工作与进行教育的有力武器
    人民解放军第四野战军兼中南军区的部队文化出版与发行工作已成为推动部队工作开展、进行思想与文化教育的有力武器。现全军师以上各级政治机关所出版的报纸、杂志、画刊等共计百余种，刊行数十万份；某些部队还出版有团报和连报。仅四野政治部出版的《政治工作》、《战士生活》、《前线画报》等三种刊物，每月即发行十余万份。除报纸、杂志之外，四野政治部和各部队都经常配合每一工作与战斗任务，出版各种丛书、小册子和专刊等。一九四九年下半年，四野政治部所出版的各种文艺与政治丛书以及宣传画等二十余种，发行总数达四十余万份。这些出版物，对鼓舞战士们的战斗意志和推动部队工作，起了极大的作用，成为部队政治工作中很重要的工具。
    一九四六年解放战争初期，部队的文化教育工作随着部队的建设而开始进行。当时领导机关即指出报纸工作应当作一项重要的政治工作任务来完成，部队里的很多负责人员亲自参加报纸工作和写稿。许多报纸工作人员在战争环境中发挥了高度的工作积极性。他们白天随着部队在冰天雪地里背着油印机行军；晚上当部队休息以后，他们还要继续工作到深夜。每天只能休息三四小时，保证报纸能及时地不间断地出版。战斗时，他们就把“编辑室”和“印刷厂”搬到火线上的掩蔽部里，用火线简讯形式的小报，把本军及友军的许多胜利消息和战斗范例，迅速地传播给战壕中每个指战员。整训时，他们更是不顾疲劳地日夜工作，差不多每天都有报纸发到部队去。有很多报纸的编辑、记者、油印员，都像战斗人员一样地立了功。
    由于这一切努力，部队的报纸便和战士群众有着非常密切的联系。普通一个师的报纸，每月就能收到几百篇甚至近一千篇指战员所写的稿件，其中包含各种经验总结性的文章、报道动态的消息、表扬典型模范的通讯和诗歌创作等。报纸有了这些生动活泼的内容，就发挥了及时地指导与推动部队工作的作用。特别是连队的报纸，更是部队文化出版工作的最重要的一个环节。某部在去年渡江前，部队开展了群众性的办连报运动，大大地鼓舞了部队中的前进思想，且对战士的文化学习帮助很大。连队的领导干部认为连报是一种帮助部队工作的很好的工具。
    在杂志方面，四野政治部出版的《政治工作》和《战士生活》很受欢迎，很多干部都把它们看作自己工作上的有力助手，经常带在身边。当《战士生活》发到连队时，战士们都抢着看，不论行军或作战时，只要休息下来，他们就找文化教员给读着听。《战士生活》上的许多文章，都成了连队的教材。
    部队里出版物的发行工作是文化出版工作的一个极重要的环节。现在第四野战军的部队发行工作已由分散的、游击的方式，发展成为正规的军邮工作。四野政治部设军邮处，兵团设军邮办事处，各军、师、团设军邮局和分局。各部队均派出一定的人员和交通工具（如汽车、马匹），专门负责运送工作。通过部队中的军邮工作，每月都把数十万份的出版物送给前方的部队。许多负责运送的人员和车辆，在极艰苦的情况下工作，他们像完成战斗任务一样地来完成这一艰巨的任务。在战争期间，军邮工作除了完成部队的报纸发行任务外，每月并把大批的指战员的家信，从前方转到后方，又把后方的家信送向前方。据统计，自去年七月到十一月的四个月里，共收转家信一百四十余万件。现在军邮处已举办了挂号邮件，并将举办包裹邮件和汇兑等业务。
