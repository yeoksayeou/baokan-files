　　Northeast People's Government Chairman
    Gao Gang Inspects Shenyang Smelter
    Instructs on Thoroughly Checking Work and Conducting Criticism and Self-Criticism

    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th] Northeast People's Government Chairman Gao Gang recently went to the Shenyang Smelter to inspect work. This is the second factory personally inspected by Chairman Gao Gang, following his inspection of Shenyang Machine Tool Plant No. 1. In three months and ten days this year, the plant completed and exceeded its semi-annual production plan for both blister copper and electrolytic copper. The quality of products improved from 98 percent of the planned grade to 98.2 percent; the actual recovery rate increased from the planned 68 percent to 68.99 percent; and the consumption of heavy oil per ton of blister copper refined decreased from the planned 110 kilograms to 103 kilograms; the labor quota was also reduced by 35 percent compared with the original plan. On this basis, the direct production cost per ton of copper was reduced by 2 percent compared to the planned cost, and by 50 percent compared to December of last year. Chairman Gao Gang encouraged the smelter for creating the above excellent results; and pointed out that the smelter's experience proves that as long as enterprise leaders are combined with all employees, and workers' labor creation is combined with technicians' scientific research, labor productivity can be greatly improved. The smelter's experience also proves that where work is carefully inspected, where criticism and self-criticism are truly carried out, and where this inspection is humbly accepted and implemented in actual work, work will definitely be improved. Finally, in view of the smelter's production nature, Chairman Gao Gang hoped that special attention would be paid to workers' health and hygiene, and that labor protection and welfare work would be improved. He also hoped that all personnel of the plant would prevent any complacency and create new records of greater quantity, better quality, and especially lower cost.

　　东北人民政府主席
    高岗检查沈阳冶炼厂
    指示认真检查工作展开批评自我批评
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北人民政府高岗主席，日前亲赴沈阳冶炼厂检查工作。这是高岗主席继检查沈阳机器第一厂后最近亲自进行检查的第二个工厂。该厂在今年三个月零十天的时间内，完成并超过了今年上半年粗铜及电铜的生产计划。产品质量由计划品位的百分之九十八提高到百分之九十八点二；实收率由计划的百分之六十八提高到六十八点九九；而炼每吨粗铜所用重油的消耗量，则由计划的一百一十公斤降低到一百零三公斤；人工定额亦较原计划减低了百分之三十五。在这样的基础上，每吨铜的直接生产成本比计划成本降低了百分之二，比去年十二月份降低了百分之五十。高岗主席对冶炼厂创造出上述优良成绩予以鼓励；并指出，冶炼厂的经验证明：只要企业领导者与全体职工相结合，工人的劳动创造与技术人员的科学研究相结合，那么劳动生产率就可大大地提高。冶炼厂的经验也同时证明：那个地方认真进行了对工作的检查，那里真正地展开了批评和自我批评，并虚心接受这种检查与在实际工作中加以贯彻，那个地方的工作就一定能够获得改进。最后，高岗主席针对该厂的生产性质，希望特别注意工人健康与卫生，改进劳动保护与福利事业，并望该厂全体人员防止任何自满情绪，创造数量更多、质量更好尤其是成本更低的新纪录。
