　　The Road to Prosperity Through Production
　　——A Visit with Communist Party Member Li Shunda
　　Yu Ming

　　Li Shunda, a Communist Party member and first-class labor hero of the former Taihang District, participated in the first Shanxi Provincial People's Representative Conference as a representative of the peasants.

　　Li Shunda joined the Chinese Communist Party as early as 1938. Under the leadership of the Party, after obtaining land through rent reduction and interest reduction, and land reform, he actively led the peasants in implementing the Party and government's policy of organizing for production to achieve prosperity. Up to now, his agricultural production has exceeded the pre-war level by one time. According to a survey of six peasant households in Xigou Village, Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province, where he is located, the yield per mu has also exceeded the pre-war level. This is inseparable from Li Shunda's leadership and initiative.

　　When the reporter asked him why production could increase so quickly, he summarized the following reasons:

　　First, after the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came, they implemented rent reduction and interest reduction, and land reform, and everyone obtained land. In the past, I didn't have a single mu of land. I rented 12.7 mu of land from the landlord, and I couldn't harvest even ten shi of grain a year, and I had to pay nine shi as rent. Of the twenty households in Xigou Village, seventeen households, like me, had fled famine from Lin County, Henan; twelve of them had no house or land. A dozen households paid more than 120 shi of rent to the landlords. So no one was enthusiastic about production. Now that we have land, everyone is willing to do whatever is asked. This is a major reason for our increased production.

　　Second, is to get organized. In 1943, the Communist Party and the People's Government proposed: "Organize to overcome famine through production." The Party, government, army, and people all launched a large-scale production movement, and land reclamation was taking place everywhere. The district government assigned us in Xigou Village the task of reclaiming twenty mu of wasteland. But some people in the village had no confidence in reclaiming wasteland; I was then the leader of the Party group in Xigou Village, and I first mobilized within the Party. Our six Party members were the first to organize. While mobilizing others to organize, we worked actively to influence them. We delivered manure as soon as the Lunar New Year was over, and it was all delivered by the fifteenth day of the first month. At that time, there was a Ma Haixing, who did not believe that organization was powerful, so our six people delivered manure for him for a day. As a result, each person delivered seventeen loads a day, while he himself delivered at most fourteen loads. This made him believe that mutual aid was powerful, and later he also joined the mutual aid group. After the fifteenth day of the first month, when the ground thawed, we started reclaiming wasteland. In addition to reclaiming wasteland, the six of us could also collect several hundred catties of firewood a day. At that time, some people saw the benefit and started working too. Niu Yongqing mobilized his wife and children to the fields. This spring, wasteland reclamation exceeded the task of twenty mu, with a total of fifty mu of virgin land reclaimed, and another seventy mu reclaimed in the fall. Everyone saw that organization meant faster work, so during weeding, another eighteen people joined the mutual aid group, and six Party members were scattered into four groups. In this way, only two of the twenty households in Xigou Village did not participate in mutual aid groups. By 1944, all the male and female full and half laborers in the village were organized. The method of calculating work points was changed from bookkeeping to fixed work point assessment, and finally the work point ticket system was adopted. At that time, some people were unwilling to join the mutual aid group, such as Lao Zhang in our village. Not only did he not participate himself, but he also opposed his nephew's participation. But during the busy farming season, he couldn't finish the work and had to hire people. At that time, we offered to weed for him. He initially disagreed, but later reluctantly agreed. It would have taken seventeen people a day to finish weeding, but our fourteen people finished it for him in one day, and weeded it very well. Lao Zhang was very satisfied, so Lao Zhang also joined the mutual aid group.

　　Here he paused, and the reporter asked, "What is the situation of your mutual aid groups now?" He replied:

　　"Now our production mutual aid has become a habit. It's like we can't work without mutual aid. As soon as the Lunar New Year is over, everyone quickly organizes into groups based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and starts doing whatever needs to be done."

　　Third, is to improve technology, promote superior varieties, and improve agricultural implements. This work only started after I participated in the first Taihang District Hero Conference in 1944. After returning to the village, I first promoted the Golden Queen corn, One-Six-Nine wheat, and Eight-One-One millet. In the fall, I organized a technical committee to conduct widespread field seed selection. Now, field seed selection is 100% implemented. Warm water seed soaking and seed disinfection have also reached 95%. In terms of improving agricultural implements, the three-legged seed drill used in the past was changed to a two-legged one, making it easier to pull seedlings and saving two workdays per mu. More importantly, is more hoeing, more plowing, and more fertilizer application. Before the War of Resistance, it was rare to hoe twice, now it is generally hoed three times. Before the war, because there were no livestock, the land was at most plowed once a year. Now cornfields can be plowed three times, and millet fields can be plowed twice (which is just right). Before the war, an average of less than 50 loads of manure were applied per mu, now it has reached 100 loads of manure per mu, and this year, including topdressing, it is planned to apply 120 loads.

　　Another very important reason for the rapid development of production is that we believe in the government's policy of developing production, respond to all the calls of the Party and the government, and at the same time receive active help and annual rewards from the Party and the government. In this way, our enthusiasm for production is even higher. In 1947 and 1948, due to some "leftist" deviations in land reform, some people dared not pursue prosperity through production. But I still firmly believed in the Party's policy, and with the greatest effort, mobilized the whole family, and successfully completed the five-year plan for prosperity and construction, which was formulated in 1946, ahead of schedule in 1948. During this period, we built four brick buildings and more than ten tile-roofed houses, dug a well, and installed a millstone.

　　Another reason why my twenty or so mu of land can yield sixty or seventy shi of grain is that we have a plan. I make detailed production plans every year. At the same time, these plans are all democratically discussed by the whole family.

　　Comrade Li Shunda not only manages his own production well, but he also leads the masses in the whole village to prosper. Before the war, there were less than ten livestock in the whole village of Xigou, but now there are truly herds of mules and horses. The total number of cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses in the whole village has reached seventy-five, an average of more than three per household. This year, we plan to breed another nine and purchase two. In just a few years, Xigou Village has transformed from poverty to prosperity. Comrade Li Shunda understood the fundamental reason for this change very correctly: The first thing he said was: rent reduction, interest reduction, and land reform. That is absolutely correct. If there had not been such a fundamental change, organizing, improving technology, and implementing planned production increases could not have been fully implemented. This is the first combat task after the liberation of the peasants, but there is another side to the problem. If there is only rent reduction, interest reduction, and land reform without hard work in production, then the peasants after land reform will still inevitably suffer from poverty. Under the leadership of the People's Government and the Party, Li Shunda and the peasants of Xigou Village have been fighting tirelessly from rent reduction, interest reduction, and land reform to every production movement. Therefore, they have begun to move from poverty to prosperity.

　　生产致富的道路
　　——共产党员李顺达访问记
　　禹明
    前太行区一等劳动英雄共产党员李顺达，这次以农民代表资格参加了山西省首届各界人民代表会议。
    李顺达早在一九三八年就参加了中国共产党。在党的领导之下，经过了减租减息、土地改革得到土地后，便积极地领导农民贯彻了党和政府的组织起来生产致富的政策。直到现在，他的农业生产已超过了战前水平的一倍，他所在的山西平顺县西沟村，根据六户农民的调查，每亩地的产量也已超过了战前的水平。这与李顺达的领导带头是分不开的。
    当记者问他生产为什么能这样提高的快时，他总结了如下几个原因：
    第一是共产党、八路军来后，实行了减租减息和土地改革，大家都得到了土地。我过去一亩地也没有，租着地主十二亩七分地，一年打不下十石粮食，就得出九石租子。西沟村二十户人家就有和我一样从河南林县逃荒来的十七户；这里面十二户就都是房无一间、地无一垅的。十几户人家就给地主出着一百二十多石租子。所以生产情绪谁也不高。现在有了土地，人人都是说干啥就干啥。这是我们提高生产的一个主要原因。
    第二是组织起来。一九四三年共产党和人民政府提出：“组织起来，生产渡荒”。党、政、军、民都开展了大生产运动，到处都在开荒。区政府给我们西沟村分配了二十亩荒地的任务。但村里有些人对开荒没有信心；我那时是西沟村党的小组长，首先在党内动员了一下，我们六个党员就首先组织起来。一面动员其它人也组织起来，一面我们积极干，影响他们。刚过了旧历年便送粪，到正月十五便全部送完了。当时有个马海兴，他不相信组织起来力量大，我们六个便给他送了一天粪，结果一天每人送了十七回，他一个人送的粪顶多送十四回。这样他相信互助起来就是有力量，后来他也参加了互助组。过了正月十五解冻后，我们便开荒。六个人除开荒外，一天还能弄几百斤柴。当时有些人看到有利，便也起来干开了。牛永青把他老婆和孩子都动员到地里了。这年春天开荒超过了二十亩的任务，共开的生荒五十亩，到秋后还又开了七十亩。大家看到组织起来就是做活快，所以在锄苗的时候，又有十八个人参加了互助组，六个党员分散到四个小组里，这样西沟村二十户人家只有二户没有参加互助组。到了一九四四年，全村所有的男女全、半劳力都组织起来了。折工办法由记账到死工活折，最后又采用了工票制。当时也有些人是不愿参加互助组的，比如我们村里老张，不但他自己不参加，他还反对他侄儿参加。可是在农忙时，他活做不过来还得雇人。当时我们便提出给他锄苗，他起先不同意，后来勉强同意了。本来得十七个人一天才能锄完，但我们十四个人一天就给他锄完了，而且锄的很好。老张很满意，这样老张也就参加了互助组。
    他说到这里记者跟着问了一句：“现在你们的互助组的情形如何？”他答道：
    “现在我们的生产互助已成了一个习惯了，不互助起来生产就好像不能干活了，一过了旧历年大家就都根据自愿两利的原则，很快地组织成小组，该干啥就干开了。”
    第三是提高技术，推广优良品种，改良农具。这个工作从我一九四四年参加了太行区首届群英大会后才开始。我回村后，首先推广了金皇后玉茭、一六九小麦和八一一谷。到秋后组织了技术委员会，普遍进行田间选种。到现在，田间选种已百分之百的实行了。温汤浸种、种子消毒现也做到了百分之九十五。在改良农具方面，把过去使用的三条腿的耧改成了两条腿，这样拔苗时既好拔，每亩地又能省二个工。更重要的是多锄多耕多上粪。抗战以前锄二次的很少，现在普遍锄三次。战前因没有牲口，地每年也顶多耕一次。现在玉茭地能耕三次，谷地能耕二次（这样就正适宜）。战前一亩地平均上不到五十担粪，现在已达到每亩地上一百担粪，今年连追肥计划上到一百二十担。
    发展生产快还有一个很重要的原因，那就是我们相信政府发展生产的政策，响应了党和政府的一切号召，同时又得到了党和政府的积极帮助和每年的奖励。这样，我们的生产情绪就更加高涨了。在一九四七和一九四八年，由于土地改革中发生了一些左倾偏向，有些人就不敢生产致富了。但我仍然坚信党的政策，用最大的努力，动员了全家，把一九四六年订出的五年发家建设计划，在一九四八年就胜利地提前完成了，在这期间盖了四间楼房和十余间瓦房，并打了一眼井，安了一盘碾子。
    我二十多亩地能打六七十石粮食，还有一个原因，那就是要有计划。我每年都订出详细的生产计划。同时，这些计划都是经过了全家民主讨论的。
    李顺达同志不但自己的生产搞得好，他还领导全村群众发了家。西沟村全村战前不到十头牲口，现在则真是骡马成群，全村的牛、驴、骡、马合计起来已有七十五头，每户平均三头还多。今年还准备再繁殖九头、购买二头。西沟村在几年之间，已经从贫困走向富裕。这个变化的根本原因在那里，李顺达同志体会得很正确：第一条他说是：减租减息土地改革。一点也不错，假使没有这样一个根本的变革，组织起来，改进技术，有计划的实行增产等都不能充分的实行。这是农民解放后的第一个战斗任务，但问题也还有另一面，假如只有减租减息、土地改革而没有努力生产，则土地改革后的农民也仍然难免于贫困。李顺达和西沟村的农民在人民政府和党的领导下，从减租减息、土地改革到每一个生产运动，一直是毫不懈怠地战斗着，因之他们开始由贫困走向了富裕。
