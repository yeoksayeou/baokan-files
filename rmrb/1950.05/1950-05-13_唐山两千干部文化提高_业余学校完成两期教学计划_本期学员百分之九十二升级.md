　　【Tangshan News from this Newspaper】The second semester of the Tangshan City Cadre Spare-Time School has concluded. Of the more than two thousand students participating in this term's studies, 92 percent have been promoted, completing the planned curriculum. The school was founded in April of last year, with 672 students at the time. After September, a large-scale, standardized, and long-term approach was adopted, and the number of students increased to 2,220. The second semester saw a further increase to 2,239 students. All in-service cadres in the city with a cultural level below junior high school graduation have been enrolled, with few exceptions. The Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has announced an education plan, scheduled to raise the cultural level of cadres with low cultural levels throughout the city to junior high school graduation within five years. Among these, illiterate individuals will study for five years, with a progression of one and a half years for the elementary school stage, one year for upper elementary school, and two and a half years for junior high school. Based on the teaching situation over the past year, this plan has a high probability of being completed on schedule.

　　In terms of teaching leadership, the school has designated personnel responsible for school affairs, employs full-time teachers, and pays special attention to the close connection between the school and the work units. A "teaching and guidance integration" method was implemented, establishing work unit group systems and tutor systems. Students from the same work unit are organized into groups, and active learners are selected as group leaders. In larger units, several groups are formed, and a chief group leader or study committee member is selected to create learning units for mutual assistance, mutual learning, inspection, and supervision. The "little teacher" system is used for mutual assistance during spare time. At the same time, school teachers are also organized into groups and assigned to various work unit groups as tutors to understand the group's learning progress, provide tutoring in the work unit to help students with their homework, guide review, solve difficulties, and collect student feedback to improve teaching methods and determine progress. Experience has proven that this method is successful. It solves the problems of "busy work, no time to review" and make-up lessons for some students after absences due to official duties, improving teaching efficiency. Furthermore, the teachers' regular visits to the work units encourage the leadership of the work units to attach importance to the cultural learning of cadres. On the other hand, the contact between teachers and students is strengthened, and they learn from each other. Not only do the students make rapid progress, but the teachers themselves are also improved. Teachers Zhang Xiuzhi, Yang Zhixi, and others have created excellent teaching experiences. In addition, the school also uses methods such as launching learning competitions, holding learning assessments every semester, and electing learning models, all of which contribute to the promotion of learning.

　　In terms of teaching methods, the school pays attention to grasping the characteristics of the students. Because the levels of the various subjects of the work unit cadres are unbalanced, the school has adopted mixed classes with interlaced classes and allows some students to take elective courses (such as if other courses have reached the junior high school graduation level). In the Chinese language class, because most students have higher reading ability but do not understand grammar and the meaning of words, and often make typos and misuse nouns, the lectures focus on grammar and application. Typos in student assignments and new words in the text are repeatedly pointed out on the blackboard. Because adults have strong comprehension ability but weak memory, the school focuses on teaching a few major subjects and connects them with reality and work to make the lectures practical and improve students' learning motivation.

### 唐山两千干部文化提高  业余学校完成两期教学计划　本期学员百分之九十二升级

　　唐山两千干部文化提高
　  业余学校完成两期教学计划           
　　本期学员百分之九十二升级
    【本报唐山讯】丁力、段星垣报道：唐山市干部业余学校第二学期已结束。本期参加学习的二千余学员，百分之九十二均已升级，完成了预定的学习计划。该校创办于去年四月，当时有学员六七二人；九月以后采取了大规模的、正规化的、长期打算的方针，学员增至二二二○人；第二学期又增至二二三九人。全市文化程度在初中毕业水平以下的在职干部除个别情形外均已入学。中共唐山市委曾宣布教育计划，预定五年内将全市文化程度低的干部均提高到初中毕业水平。其中文盲学习五年，进度是初小阶段一年半，高小一年，初中二年半。根拟一年来的教学情况，此一计划已有充分可能如期完成。
    在教学领导方面，该校设有专人负责校务，聘有专职教员，并特别注意学校与机关的密切联系。实行了“教导合一”办法，建立了机关小组制和导师制。同一机关的学员均编成小组，选出学习中的积极分子作组长，大单位中则分编几个小组，选出总组长或学委，成为互助互学、检查督促的学习单位。利用“小先生”制在课余进行互助学习。同时，学校教员也编成组，分配到各机关小组作导师，一面了解小组学习情况，一面去机关给学员补习功课，指导复习，解决疑难，并收集学员反映以作改进教学方法与确定进度的依据。经验证明，此一办法是成功的，通过它解决了机关干部“工作忙，没时间复习”与一部分学员因公缺课后的补课问题，提高了教学效率；而且由于教员的常去机关，一面促使机关的领导方面重视了干部的文化学习，另一方面教员与学员的联系加强了，他们互相学习，不独学员进步快，也提高了教员自己。教员张秀芝、杨志熙等，并创造了很好的教学经验。此外该校还采用发动学习竞赛，每学期举行学习鉴定和选举学习模范等方法，都有助于学习的推进。
    在教学方法上，该校注意了掌握学员特点。因为机关干部的各科程度不平衡，该校采取了混合班穿插上课，并允许一部分学员选修某一门课程（如其他课程已达初中毕业水平）。在国文课中，因一般学员都是阅读能力较高，而搞不清文法组织与字义，常有写错别字、不分场合乱搬名词等毛病，因此，讲课时注意文法和应用，对学员作业中的错别字和课文中的生字，都再三在黑板上提示。由于成年人理解力较强而记忆力较弱，该校注意了集中教几门主要课，并联系实际，联系工作来讲课，作到学以致用，提高了学员的学习情绪。
