Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 27th: TASS Berlin, May 27th—The streets and public buildings of the capital of the German Democratic Republic are adorned with festive decorations. Berlin is welcoming its guests - the participants of the All-German Youth Congress. Flags of all kinds fly throughout the city. The flags of democratic countries around the world fly above the building of the Central Committee of the Free German Youth League. On many buildings, squares and streets, one can now see flags embroidered with the emblems of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the Free German Youth League, and the Pioneer League. Young men and women in blue shirts fill the city. Young people march in formation in groups.

The youth delegations from various countries around the world who came to participate in the All-German Youth Congress arrived here on May 26th. The Soviet delegation was led by Kozymasov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League. The international guests were given a grand welcome by the young people participating in the congress.

The scene in West Berlin stands in stark contrast to the vibrant festive atmosphere of East Berlin. The streets are lifeless and pedestrians are scarce. The British and American occupation authorities are doing everything possible to sabotage the grand demonstration of youth for the unification of Germany. They announced that in the areas under their rule, young people wearing blue shirts would be treated as bandits.

However, all the attempts of the imperialists to obstruct the congress will fail. Marching in Berlin are the free German youth – the future of the Democratic Germany; on their banners is written the call to fight for lasting and inviolable world peace.

　　全德青年大会前夕
    柏林充满节日气象
    到处旗帜飘扬青年结队前进
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社柏林二十七日讯：德意志民主共和国首都的街道和公共建筑物，都已披上了节日的盛装。柏林正在迎接着它的来宾——全德青年大会的参与者们。各种旗帜飘遍了全城。全世界民主国家的国旗，飘扬在德国青年联盟中委会的大厦上。在许多大厦、广场和街道上，现在都可以看到绣有世界民主青联、自由德国青年联盟、青年先锋队联合会会徽的旗帜。身穿蓝色衬衣的男女青年，充满全市。青年们成群结队，迈步前进。
    来此参加全德青年大会的世界各国青年代表团，于五月二十六日抵此。苏联代表团系由苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记科齐马索夫率领。国际的来宾受到参加大会的青年们的盛大欢迎。
    柏林西区的情景，和东区生气勃勃的节日景象，恰成鲜明的对照。街道死气沉沉，行人稀少。英美占领当局竭尽一切可能破坏青年们为争取德国统一而举行的盛大示威。他们宣布说：在他们统治的地区内，穿蓝衬衫的青年，将被当作盗匪。
    然而，帝国主义者的一切阻挠大会的企图仍将落空。在柏林迈进的，是自由的德国青年——民主德国的未来，在他们的旗帜上，写着为持久而不可侵犯的世界和平而斗争的号召。
