　　Xinhua News Agency, Chicago: The Executive Committee meeting of the National Labor Peace Conference, representing more than one million workers, opened here on May 28. Fifty-four representatives from various US labor unions attended the meeting.
　　The Executive Committee endorsed signing the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace and decided to launch a broad movement within the American labor movement to sign the declaration. Speakers at the meeting urged American workers to intensify the struggle for peace. Delkin, President of the Federation of Clerical and Professional Employees, emphasized that the "Cold War policy" of the major employers and their agents in the US Democratic and Republican parties, as well as the leadership of the reactionary trade unions, are responsible for all attacks against the organized labor movement in the United States. The Executive Committee decided to participate in the World Congress of Supporters of Peace to be held in Italy in October and designated August 1-8 as National Peace Week in the United States. The Executive Committee decided to organize at least two hundred local union and workshop peace committees before August.
