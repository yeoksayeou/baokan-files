Complete Half-Year Production Tasks Ahead of Schedule

[This Dispatch from Tangshan] During the "Red May" production emulation campaign, the Tangshan Railway Factory put forward the slogan of completing half a year's production tasks in five months. Currently, the factory's passenger and freight cars have completed their half-year production tasks ahead of schedule, and locomotives will also complete their half-year tasks by the end of the month. The factory's forging workshop completed its half-year task 55 days ahead of schedule, on May 6th, completing 690,420 kilograms of forged iron, exceeding the ministry-set task by slightly more than one percent. As of May 15th, the underframe group had overhauled 498.26 cars, exceeding the ministry-set half-year task by 47.36 cars. The foundry, machine shop, and air brake group also completed their half-year production tasks successively on May 17th. Other production units are vigorously producing to strive to complete all half-year production tasks by the end of May.

[Jilin Dispatch] Jilin Daily reported: As of May 16th, the Jilin City State-owned Yuhua Paper Mill had completed its first half-year production task of 95,500 kilograms of paper 45 days ahead of schedule, exceeding the original plan by 0.53 percent, and the product quality met specifications. Although the factory had overfulfilled its production task in the first quarter, there were still shortcomings such as untimely supply of raw materials and workers' lack of concern for the production plan. Starting in April, leading cadres handed the second-quarter production plan to workers for discussion, enabling the workers to clarify the production goals, raise many problems that needed to be solved, and propose methods to ensure the completion of tasks. In terms of systems, the shift handover system was strengthened, workshop meetings were improved, and the disunity among workers was overcome. The production enthusiasm of the staff and workers was generally high. The operating methods have also been significantly improved: the efficiency of the knife cutting was doubled; the supply of raw materials to the mixing tank was constantly guaranteed, overcoming the phenomenon of waiting for materials while production was halted. The factory exceeded its April task by 103.4 percent, and completed its half-year task ahead of schedule on May 16th. All staff and workers unanimously proposed to strive to complete the annual production task before October 1st this year to celebrate their National Day.

[Changsha Dispatch] New Hunan Daily reported: Workers of the Hunan Shaoyang Private Guangming Electric Light Company improved technology and increased production, creating remarkable achievements by completing a half-year plan in three months. Although the company is privately owned, due to the factory's implementation of the policy of democratic management and the sincere acceptance of reasonable suggestions from the worker masses, the production plan has been repeatedly discussed by the masses. In a series of democratic management efforts, such as uniting employees, evaluating wages, signing collective labor-capital contracts, and establishing a company management committee, the production enthusiasm and creativity of all workers have gradually been developed. The boiler room repaired three large boilers, shortening the working hours by 47.1 percent compared to the original plan. Old worker Li Chuanshan successfully trial-produced alloy "Ban Gen" to replace imported rubber "Ban Gen", which can save 50 million yuan annually. At the Shaoyang City "May Day" commendation and celebration meeting, many workers from the factory were awarded. Li Chuanshan was elected as a first-class labor model, and the mayor personally put the glorious flower on him.
