　　Eliminating Tax Evasion and Striving for Fair Burden
　  Beijing's Tax Revenue Increases
　　[Our Newspaper] Reporter Lin Hong reports: Since the liberation of Beijing, the amount of various tax revenues has increased. This is one of the basic factors for Beijing's financial revenue and expenditure approaching balance; it is the result of the active efforts of all tax cadres to gradually eliminate tax evasion. Taking the regular tax revenue in March of last year as a base, it increased to 249 percent in June and 410 percent in December. The regular tax revenue in the spring of 1950 exceeded the original plan by 51.2 percent.
　　The Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau was established on March 12th of last year, and soon after, various sub-bureaus were also established one after another. At that time, there were very few tax personnel, they were not familiar with the urban situation, and a complete set of urban tax laws had not yet been established. Therefore, when collecting taxes, they temporarily adopted the old tax system, adhering to the principle of ensuring urban financial supply and abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes. All kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies imposed on the people by the Kuomintang government were abolished, reducing the number of tax items from 37 in the past to 17. When levying the 1949 spring business tax, the 1948 second half-year profit-seeking enterprise income tax, the 1949 first half-year profit-seeking enterprise income tax, and the summer business tax, reductions or exemptions were granted to industries that were beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, in accordance with the new tax law. This approach was very welcomed by the broad masses of the people.
　　In March of last year, Beijing fully launched the collection of various taxes, and the Taxation Bureau encountered many difficulties. The biggest problem among them was that many industrialists and businessmen complained about "poor business conditions and excessive burden." In order to understand the true situation and solve this difficulty, the Taxation Bureau adopted the "self-reporting and public discussion" method of collection from the bottom up when collecting the spring business tax last April. In various industries, typical investigations were also conducted as a reference for public discussion. After the Taxation Bureau grasped the actual materials, those industrialists and businessmen who attempted to pay less tax no longer complained about excessive burden. When re-levying the profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the second half of 1948, the Municipal Taxation Bureau organized a promotion committee with representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, and various industry joint evaluation committees and industry evaluation committees composed of representatives of industrialists and businessmen, and improved the industrial and commercial household groups. With the assistance of organized masses, tax work began to get on the right track. In terms of collection methods, the method of assigning tasks from top to bottom and democratic evaluation from bottom to top was further adopted, and hundreds of people were organized to conduct investigations of typical households. The results of the two levies proved that in newly liberated cities, where the government does not fully understand the situation and cadres are not familiar with the business, adopting democratic evaluation combined with typical investigations is a better way to promote tax revenue. The results of several typical investigations by the Taxation Bureau proved that the industrial and commercial tax actually borne by general industrialists and businessmen was lower than the tax amount they should bear. The Taxation Bureau investigated the tax payment situation of 33 Chinese medicine businesses, and the amount of profit-seeking enterprise income tax and summer business tax they paid in the first half of 1949 accounted for only 72.47 percent of their should-be burden on average. The household with the highest individual burden only accounted for 98 percent of their should-be burden, and the lowest only accounted for 28 percent of their should-be burden. The average burden of 24 Western medicine businesses accounted for 72.41 percent of the should-be burden, with the household with the highest burden accounting for 98.5 percent of its should-be burden, and the lowest accounting for only 38 percent. However, the phenomenon of unbalanced burden exists between industries and within various industries. In order to improve the above shortcomings, when conditions are ripe, the method of "democratic evaluation" should be transitioned to the method of "self-reporting and investigation."
　　Regular tax revenue occupies an important position in the total tax revenue. Beijing's regular tax revenue in 1949 totaled more than 53.78 million catties of millet, accounting for more than 55 percent of the total tax revenue for the year. The scope of regular tax collection is very broad, and the tax source is very scattered. Under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, general industrialists and businessmen have also developed the habit of making false accounts and evading taxes, which has added some difficulties to the collection work. In order to solve this problem, the Taxation Bureau adopted the method of strengthening regular anti-smuggling work and organizing manpower at any time to conduct comprehensive or key surprise inspections, and achieved great results. From June to December of last year, a total of 18,461 cases of violations were investigated. After each surprise inspection, the tax revenue for that month inevitably increased a lot. Although the phenomenon of tax evasion has been reduced compared to the past, it is still very serious now. Especially when the Taxation Bureau concentrates manpower on central tasks such as industrial and commercial tax, regular tax revenue will be significantly reduced. The Municipal Taxation Bureau is preparing to strengthen inspection work and gradually achieve "regularization of central work" to reduce the impact of central work on regular tax revenue.

### 消灭漏税现象力求负担公平  京市税收增加

　　消灭漏税现象力求负担公平
　  京市税收增加
    【本报讯】记者林洪报道：京市解放以来，各种税收数额增加。这是北京市财政收支接近平衡的基本因素之一；是全体税务工作干部积极努力，逐步消灭漏税现象的结果。以去年三月份的经常性税收为基数，六月份增至百分之二百四十九，十二月份增至百分之四百一十。一九五○年春季经常性税收，超过了原计划的百分之五十一点二。
    京市税务局于去年三月十二日成立，不久，各分局也陆续建立起来。当时，税务工作人员很少，对城市情况又不熟习，还没有建立一套完整的城市税法，所以在收税时，曾经掌握保证城市财政供给和废除苛杂的原则，暂时沿用旧税制。国民党政府加在人民头上的各种苛捐杂税都取消了，以税目而论，由过去的三十七种减到十七种。在征收一九四九年春季营业税，一九四八年下半年营利事业所得税，一九四九年上半年营利事业所得税，和夏季营业税时，更按照新的税法，对有利国计民生的行业，分别予以减征或免征。这种作法，甚为广大人民所欢迎。
    去年三月，京市全面开征各种税收，税务局曾碰到许多困难。其中最大的问题是，不少工商业家吵着“营业情况不好，负担过重”。为了了解真实情况，解决这一困难，税务局在去年四月开征春季营业税时，采用了自下而上的“自报公议”的征收方法。在各行业中，又进行典型调查，作为公议中的参考。税务局掌握了实际材料之后，那些企图少纳税的工商业者便不再叫喊过重了。第二次补征一九四八年下半年度的营利事业所得税时，市税务局组织了有工商界代表参加的推进委员会，及由工商业者代表组成的各行业联评委员会，行业评议委员会，并健全了工商业户的小组。在有组织的群众协助下，税收工作开始走上正规的道路。在征收方法上，进一步采用了由上而下分配任务，和由下而上的民主评议的方式，同时又组织了几百人进行典型户的调查。两次征收的结果证明：在新解放的城市，政府对情况不十分了解，干部对业务又不熟习，采用民主评议并结合典型调查，是推动税收的较好办法。税务局几次典型调查的结果证明，一般工商业家实际负担的工商业税，都低于应负担的税额。税务局调查了三十三户国药业的纳税情况，他们缴纳的一九四九年上半年营利事业所得税及夏季营业税的数额，平均只占其应负担额的百分之七十二点四七，个别负担最高的户，也只占其应负担的百分之九十八。最低的只占应负担额的百分之二十八。二十四户西药业，平均负担数占应负担数的百分之七十二点四一，负担最高户占其应负担额的百分之九十八点五，最低者只占百分之三十八。但是，在行业与行业之间，或各行业内部，负担不平衡的现象是存在的。为了改进上述缺点，当条件成熟时，就应由“民主评议”的方法过渡到“自报查征”的方法。
    经常性的税收，在全部的税收中占着重要地位。京市一九四九年度经常性税收共收入五千三百七十八万余斤小米，占全年税收总数的百分之五十五强。经常性税收课征范围甚广，税源又很分散，一般工商业者在国民党反动政府长期统治下，又养成了造假账和漏税的习惯，这就给征收工作增加了若干困难。为了解决这个问题，税务局采取了加强经常性的缉私工作，和随时组织人力，进行全面或重点突击检查的办法，获得很大成绩。从去年六月到十二月，共查获违章案件一万八千四百六十一件。每一次突击检查以后，该月的税收必然增加很多。漏税现象虽已较前减少，现在还是很严重的。特别是在税局集中人力进行工商业税等中心工作时，经常税收就会显著减少。市税局准备加强稽查工作，并逐步作到“中心工作经常化”，以减少中心工作对经常税收的影响。
