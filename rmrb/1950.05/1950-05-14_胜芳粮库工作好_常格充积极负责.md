　　Shengfang Grain Depot Works Well
　　Chang Gechong is Active and Responsible
　　[Baoding News] According to the Hebei Daily news on May 9th: Chang Gechong, a cadre of the Shengfang Town Grain Depot, only left production in April last year. After education and training from higher authorities and his own efforts, he clearly understood the importance of grain work in national construction. He developed a clear mass perspective and an ideological commitment to serving the people wholeheartedly. He often said, "Whether grain is properly stored is a test of the strength of each grain work cadre's mass perspective." He regularly inspects all the grain depots under his responsibility and helps others when he has time. During each inspection, he meticulously uses an iron probe to check all four corners of the depot. If he finds even a slight dampness on the wall, he immediately moves the grain to the other side, preventing good grain from touching the wall. As a result, not a single grain in each depot under his responsibility has become moldy since the autumn grain collection last year. In addition, every time grain is dispensed, he promptly sweeps up any spilled grain on the ground with a broom, sifts out the soil from the grain, picks out the clods, and puts it back into the depot. One rarely sees even a single grain in the yard.
　　Especially recently, during two consecutive days and three nights of heavy rain, he was even more responsible, inspecting two or three times a day in the rain. Although there were no leaks in any of the depots during the inspection on the first day, he did not become complacent because of this. The heavier the rain, the more frequently he inspected. On the evening of April 17th, he was worried and couldn't sleep. At midnight, he got up again and inspected the depots in the rain. There were still no leaks, so he rested. The next morning, before it was light, he hurried to the depots to inspect again. Finally, because the rain was too heavy, he found several leaks. He immediately found furniture to catch the water and took out the wet grain to dry it. He also climbed onto the roof tiles in the heavy rain to check for leaks, his clothes soaked through. When others told him to quickly change, he said, "Clothes can dry when wet, but spoiled grain is beyond cure!" Due to his active and responsible spirit, he finally protected the grain in all the depots, and not a single grain was damaged.

　　胜芳粮库工作好
　　常格充积极负责
    【保定讯】据五月九日河北日报消息：胜芳镇粮库干部常格充，去年四月份才脱离生产，经过上级的教育培养和自己的努力，清楚地认识了粮食工作在国家建设中的重要意义，有了明确的群众观点，和忠心为人民服务的事业思想。他常说：“粮食保管的好坏，就是对每个粮食工作干部的群众观点强弱的考验。”他对他所负责的各个粮库，都能按期的进行检查，有空还帮助别人；在每次检查时，都是细致的用铁探子把库的四角都探遍了，如发现墙皮略潮一点，就马上把粮食倒到另一边去，不叫好粮食再挨着墙。因此他负责的每个粮库，从去年秋征入库到现在，一粒粮食也没有霉坏。另外在每次开支粮食时，都是随时把洒在地上的粮食用扫帚扫起来，把粮食里的土筛出，把坷垃拣出去，再倒在库内，院里很少见到一粒粮食。
    特别是最近，一连两天三夜的大雨，他更负责地每天冒雨检查两三次，虽然在头一天检查时各库一点也没有漏，可是他丝毫不因此就麻痹起来。雨越下越大，他也就检查的越勤。四月十七日晚上，他担心地睡不着觉。到了半夜，他又起来冒雨检查了一遍，各库还没有漏的地方，他才休息了。第二天天还不明，又赶快到各库去检查，终于因为雨下的太大了，发现有几处漏下水来，他马上找家具接上，把湿了的粮食收出来晾干；又在大雨中爬到房檐瓦垅上去查看漏洞，衣服淋的直往下流水，别人叫他赶快换衣服，他说：“衣服湿了还能干，粮食坏了可是没治！”由于他这种积极负责的精神，终于保护了各库的粮食一粒也没有坏损。
