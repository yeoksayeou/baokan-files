    Letter from Farmers of Xisi Kuaiyu Village Reporting Losses Caused by Garrison Troops
    Editor:
    We are residents of Nanquekou, Section 19, Third Outer District of this city. We hope to have our opinions published in the People's Garden. The matter is as follows: Our village is located near the east wall of the Temple of Heaven. The Third Company of the × Regiment of the People's Liberation Army is stationed inside the Temple of Heaven. We very much welcome the glorious People's Liberation Army to be stationed near us, and we are very willing to help them. They have a good attitude when they borrow things from us, and we are happy to lend them anything we have. However, there are also individual PLA comrades who do not have a good attitude when borrowing things. Sometimes, when we need to use something ourselves, they insist on borrowing it. Some of them do not return things on time after borrowing them; others damage things and do not compensate us for the price. For example, they borrowed a pickaxe from Li Guangcheng and bent the head of the pickaxe and broke off a piece of iron. They compensated him one thousand yuan, but Li Guangcheng intends to take it for repair himself, estimating that it will cost 20,000 yuan. They borrowed a pickaxe, a sickle, and an axe from Dong Deshun's house, saying they would borrow them for two or three hours, but it has been ten days and they have not returned them. They borrowed Yu Zhonghai's handcart and broke four cart beams, but they did not compensate him; Yu Zhonghai had to repair it himself. Two shovels borrowed through the security group leader Zhao Guishun were both 80% new, but when they were returned, they were not the original shovels, but two small shovel heads. We are really dissatisfied with these comrades. We once asked the police station to negotiate with them, hoping that they would all go through the district office when borrowing things in the future. Later, some comrades came to the security group leader Zhao Guishun to help borrow a shovel. Zhao asked them to talk to the police station first, and one comrade actually said, "You're still relying on the police station to suppress people!" As a result, they borrowed three more pushcarts.
    We demand that the leaders of the troops educate these comrades who have a bad work style, take care of our difficulties when borrowing things from farmers, and immediately investigate the losses of the masses' utensils and give appropriate compensation!
    Representatives of the people of Xisi Kuaiyu, Nanquekou: Zhao Guishun, Yang Wenying

    西四块玉村农民来信报告驻军造成居民损失编辑同志：
    我们是本市外三分局十九段管界南缺口的民众。我们这个意见希望在人民园地发表出来。事情是这样的：本村靠近天坛东墙外，天坛内住有解放军×团第三连。我们非常欢迎光荣的解放军驻扎我们附近，我们很愿意帮助他们。他们向我们借东西，态度很好，我们只要有，都乐于借给他们。但是也有个别解放军同志，借用东西，态度不大好，有时我们自己要用，他们硬要借。他们借去，有的不按期送还；有的损坏了不照价赔偿。举例子说，他们借李广成镐一把，把镐头弄弯了，又弄碎了一块铁，他们赔了一千元，李广成准备自己拿去修理，估价需两万元。到董德顺家借去一把镐，一张镰，一柄斧头，说借两三个钟头，结果已经借去十天了，还没有还来。借玉中海的手车，弄坏了四根车梁，他们也没赔偿；玉中海还是自己修了。经过治安组长赵桂顺手借去的两把锹，都是八成新，但是归还时，有两把也不是原来的，是两个小锹头。我们对于这些同志实在不满意，曾经请派出所向他们交涉，希望他们以后借东西通通经区公所。后来又有同志来找治安组长赵桂顺帮借一把锹，赵请他们先向派出所谈，有一个同志竟说：“你还仗着派出所来压人！”结果又借去三个排子车。
    我们要求：部队领导上要教育这些作风不好的同志，向农民借东西，要照顾我们的困难，同时立即调查群众用具的损失，给以适当赔偿！
