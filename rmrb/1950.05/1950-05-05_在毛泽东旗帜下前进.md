　　Advancing Under the Banner of Mao Zedong
    *People's Daily* Special Feature

　　Yesterday's grand parade in the capital celebrating Youth Day was a magnificent demonstration by the youth of the capital. Yesterday, the wind and sand were strong, with the west wind fiercely whipping countless red flags. The youth bravely advanced in the ranks of red flags, braving the west wind. The youth of Beijing have always maintained the revolutionary tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement. The older generation of youth once resisted the Northern Warlords. This generation of youth engaged in a long and heroic struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. Whips, clubs, and bloody massacres have never been able to subdue the will of the Beijing youth, and each suppression only aroused the Beijing youth to even more resolute struggle. Now, the Beijing youth, along with all the Chinese people, have achieved a great victory. In this victorious situation, in the great people's capital, in front of Tiananmen Square, which has rich revolutionary historical significance, and on the great May Fourth festival, they held a grand demonstration. This is not only a celebration of their own victory but also a review of their own strength. In the face of such an invincible youth procession, no wind or sand could stop the will of the Beijing youth to advance.

　　When the parade passed through the magnificent Tiananmen Square, 90,000 young people used various forms to express their love for their leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the Chinese Communist Party.

　　Many units formed five-pointed stars with human ranks, some units formed "Chairman Mao" and "Stalin," some formed "May Fourth," this glorious holiday, some used different colors of clothing to form "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Commemorate May Fourth," etc. This not only expressed the revolutionary enthusiasm of the youth but also fully demonstrated the creativity of the young comrades.

　　The youth were reviewed by Comrade Liu Shaoqi. Ninety thousand people cheered wildly in front of Tiananmen Square, the loud voices shaking the heavens and the earth. Some people waved their hands incessantly, applauded continuously, and those beating waist drums and performing Yangko dances used all their strength and the most skilled techniques. Every young person wanted to see the leaders on the Tiananmen gate tower clearly. The binoculars carried by one female comrade were once scrambled for by many people. This was indeed extraordinary! For many years, the youth of Beijing suffered the cruel rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. And today, when Comrade Liu Shaoqi shouted "Long Live" to them, how could they not be excited? Therefore, many young people only cared about shouting "Long Live" to their heart's content! And were reluctant to move forward in front of Tiananmen.

　　The procession of the capital's celebration of Youth Day was a glorious microcosm of the great unity of Chinese youth. The yellow ranks of the People's Liberation Army, the blue ranks of workers, the white or other colored ranks of students, the gray ranks of youth of government cadres, and the ranks of men and women citizens dressed in various clothes… In these ranks, there were also young people of minority nationalities wearing bright clothes. They used their own languages to cheer the name of the great leader Chairman Mao.

　　In the ranks of 90,000 people, there were also the neat and vigorous ranks of the Chinese Young Pioneers.

　　The May Fourth Movement is already thirty-one years old. The young people of "May Fourth" are now old, and the teenagers of that time have now become middle-aged. The current teenagers are happy. Comrade Liu Shaoqi especially wished the young comrades long life when this lovely procession passed through Tiananmen. Because the teenagers have the future of our new China. (Attached picture)

　　在毛泽东旗帜下前进
    本报特写
    昨日首都庆祝青年节的大游行，是首都青年雄壮的大示威。昨天风沙甚大，西风猛卷着无尽的红旗，青年们冒着西风在红旗的行列中勇敢地前进。北京的青年一向保持着“五四”的革命传统、老一代的青年曾经反抗过北洋军阀，这一代的青年和国民党反动派作过长期的英勇的斗争，皮鞭、棍棒和血腥的屠杀从来都没有屈服得了北京青年的意志，而且每一次的镇压，都只有激起北京青年更坚决的斗争。现在北京青年和全中国人民一道取得了伟大的胜利，在胜利的形势下、在伟大的人民首都、在有丰富革命历史意义的天安门前、在伟大的五四节日，来举行大示威，这不仅是庆祝自己的胜利，而且是自己力量的检阅。在这样不可战胜的青年行列面前，什么风沙也阻止不了北京青年前进的意志。
    游行的行列经过壮丽的天安门时，九万青年用各种各样的形式，表示对于自己的领袖毛泽东同志和中国共产党的热爱。
    有许多单位用人的行列组成五角星，有的单位组成“毛主席”和“斯大林”，有的组成“五四”这个光荣的节日，有的用不同颜色的衣服组成“毛主席万岁”、“纪念五四”等；这不仅表示青年们的革命热情，而且充分表现了青年同志们的创造力。
    青年们受着刘少奇同志的检阅。九万人在天安门前狂热地欢呼，洪亮的声音震天动地。有些人不停地挥手，不停地鼓掌，打腰鼓的，扭秧歌的，都使出了他们与她们全身的力量与最熟练的技术。每一个青年都想看清楚天安门城楼上的领袖们，一位女同志所带的望远镜曾经为许多人所争用。这确是不平常的！多少年来，北京的青年受着蒋匪帮残酷的统治；而今天，当刘少奇同志对他们高呼“万岁”时他们怎能不激动呢？所以许多青年只顾尽情的高呼“万岁”！而在天安门前恋恋不肯前进了。
    首都庆祝青年节大游行的行列，是一幅光辉的中国青年大团结的缩影。黄色的人民解放军行列，蓝色的工人行列，白色的或其他各色的学生行列，灰色的机关干部青年的行列，还有穿着各种服装的男女市民的行列……在这些行列中，还有穿戴鲜艳的少数民族的青年。他们用自己的语言，欢呼伟大的领袖毛主席的名字。
    在九万人的行列里，还有整齐矫健的中国少年儿童队的行列。
    五四运动已经三十一周年了，“五四”时年青的人，现在已经老年了，那时候的少年，现在已经变成中年了。现在的少年们是幸福的。刘少奇同志在这个可爱的行列经过天安门的时候，特别祝福少年同志们万岁。因为，少年们有我们新中国的将来。（附图片）
