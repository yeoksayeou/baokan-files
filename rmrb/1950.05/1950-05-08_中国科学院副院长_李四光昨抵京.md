Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and famous geologist, arrived in Beijing on the 6th. Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Vice Presidents Tao Menghe and Zhu Kezhen, heads of various bureaus of the Academy of Sciences, and Professor Qian Duansheng were at the station to welcome him. That evening at 7 o'clock, President Guo Moruo hosted a banquet in his honor. Those invited to accompany him included Li Jishen, Lu Dingyi, Ma Xulun, Hu Qiaomu, Ding Xielin, and many people from the scientific community. Vice President Li Siguang went to the United Kingdom two years ago to attend the 18th International Geological Congress and was nominated last year by the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Conference of Representatives of Natural Sciences to attend the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries threatened him in many ways, vainly attempting to force Mr. Li to deny this, but were sternly rejected. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, Li Siguang was appointed Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. After hearing about the nationwide victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause while abroad, Vice President Li Siguang was infinitely excited and left England last year via Switzerland and Hong Kong to return to the country. After arriving at the motherland's gate, Vice President Li saw all kinds of new atmosphere in the motherland and believed that the future of China's scientific cause was infinitely bright. According to Vice President Li, Chinese students studying science abroad are constantly eager to return to New China and serve the people.

　　中国科学院副院长
    李四光昨抵京
    【新华社七日讯】中国科学院副院长、名地质学家李四光于六日抵京。赴车站欢迎的有中央人民政府李济深副主席、中国科学院郭沫若院长、陶孟和、竺可桢副院长、科学院各局负责人及钱端升教授等。当晚七时，郭沫若院长特设宴欢迎。应邀作陪者有李济深、陆定一、马叙伦、胡乔木、丁燮林及科学界人士多人。李四光副院长前年赴英国出席第十八届国际地质学年会，去年被中华全国自然科学代表大会筹备会推选为出席中国人民政治协商会议代表。当时国民党反动派曾多方威胁，妄图要李氏否认，但均经严词拒绝。中央人民政府成立后，李四光又被任为中国科学院副院长。李副院长在海外听到祖国人民革命事业取得全国胜利后，无限兴奋，即于去年离英经瑞士转香港返国。李副院长抵达国门后，看到祖国种种新生气象，认为中国科学事业前途有无限光明。据李副院长谈，我国在海外研究科学的留学生无时不在热望返回新中国，为人民服务。
