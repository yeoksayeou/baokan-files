　　Disregarding the Opinions of the Masses
　　The Changping Third District Committee Actually Resorts to Violence
    Please Investigate and Handle Immediately by the Changping County Committee

To the Editor:
    Du Shijun (Party member), the village chief of the Sixth Village, Gaoliying Town, Third District, Changping, has engaged in various illegal activities:

    When the People's Liberation Army was besieging Beijing, because the supply of provisions had not arrived, they temporarily borrowed grain from the people. Within a few days, the military grain was delivered, and all the borrowed grain was returned. However, when he collected this food grain from the masses, he used the old scale, but when returning it, he used the new scale, resulting in a shortage of one jin for every ten jin returned, which is clearly a case of embezzlement and self-enrichment by the village chief.

    During the land reform in our village last year, village chief Du actually appropriated fertile land for himself. He originally owned a portion of land and houses in Huairou County (the land in Huairou was cultivated for him by Zhao Lianyu, Zhao Lianzhong, Zhang Shun, and others from our village), and he also received a portion in our village. This behavior is illegal. When adjusting housing this year, it was divided equally according to the number of people, but Du village chief's family only has three people, yet they were allocated four rooms, while a household of six people only received two and a half rooms. Furthermore, his wife's family, surnamed Mou, with three people, received five main rooms; his close relatives, a landlord family surnamed Mou, with six people, were left with ten rooms.

    During the land re-examination and class determination this year, Du Shijun did not convene a mass meeting, but instead decided through discussions with a few people. As a result, many of the determined class statuses do not match the actual situations of the individuals.

    Due to these illegal facts, the villagers felt they could no longer endure it and went to the district government to accuse him. On the third day, the district government convened more than forty co-signatories to discuss the matter, but Li Yongtang, the district committee member of the district, without carefully inquiring about the various allegations, detained military family member Zhang Xushi, Qin Shiling, widow Gao Yangshi, Yang Wenyuan (rich peasant), and Yang Wenqing in a temporary detention center. Later, three people were released, and two were sent to the police station. The next day, ten of the original co-signatories went to the district government to inquire about the situation of the two detained individuals and requested a response to the accusations. When the district committee member Li Yongtang received them, he was rude and violent, raising his hand to beat those who inquired, including Xing Fuhai (middle peasant), Lü Delong (military family), Yang Wenhan (deputy village chief, Party member), Zhang Zhenting (Party member), Zhang Xueren (branch secretary), and others. He also pulled out a gun to intimidate Zhang Shun and Mang Xiangyun, threatening to shoot them. Please, Editor, forward this situation to the relevant authorities for thorough investigation!

Changping Gaoliying Sixth Village Xing Fuhai

Editor's Note: According to the situation described in Xing Fuhai's letter, the work in the Sixth Village of Gaoliying Town has many problems. When the masses of the village went to the district to accuse, the district not only did not conduct a proper investigation and handling but instead detained and beat the masses. Please, the Changping County Government and County Committee, quickly investigate and handle this matter and inform this newspaper of the results.

### 不细心考虑群众意见　昌平三区区委竟动手打人　请昌平县委速调查处理

　　不细心考虑群众意见
　　昌平三区区委竟动手打人     
    请昌平县委速调查处理编辑同志：
    昌平三区高丽营镇第六村村长杜世俊（党员）有种种不法行为：
    解放军围攻北京时，因给养接济未到，暂借民粮，未数日，军粮运到，所借民粮全部归还。但他在向群众收此食粮的时候系用老秤，归还时则用新秤，以致还十斤差一斤，显系该村长贪污自肥。
    去岁本村土地改革时，杜村长竟将肥沃土地归其所有。他在原籍怀柔县境内原有土地房屋一份（怀柔的地曾由本村赵连玉、赵连仲、张顺等帮他耕过），又在本村分一份。此种行为实属违法。本年调整房屋时，按人口多少均分，但杜村长家里只有三口人，竟分房四间，而某户六口却只分得房二间半，又他岳家某姓三口，分到主房五间；其至亲某姓地主六口人，留与房屋十间。
    本年土地复查评成份时，杜世俊没有召集群众开会，竟由几个人开会讨论决定。以致所定的许多成份与本人实际情况不符。
    由于这些不法事实，老乡们觉得忍无可忍，遂到区政府控诉他。第三日由区政府召集四十多个联名具诉人讨论，但该区区委李永堂对我们所诉各条，未经仔细询问，竟羁押军属张徐氏、秦士龄、孀妇高杨氏、杨文元（富农）、杨文清五人于临时拘留所。后将三人释放，二人解往派出所。次日原联名控诉者十人复往区政府探询被押二人情形，并请答复控诉各条。该区委李永堂接见时，态度蛮横，向询问者举手便打，计被打的有邢富海（中农）、吕德隆（军属）、杨文汉（副村长，党员）、张振庭（党员）、张学仁（支书）等数人。并掏枪向张顺、莽祥云威吓，扬言要枪毙他们。请编辑将此情况转有关机关彻查！
                        昌平高丽营第六村  邢富海
    编者按：根据邢富海来信所说的情况，高丽营镇第六村的工作，问题很多，经该村群众到区控诉，区上不但不好好进行调查处理，反而扣押、殴打群众。请昌平县政府及县委迅速调查处理，并将结果告诉本报。
