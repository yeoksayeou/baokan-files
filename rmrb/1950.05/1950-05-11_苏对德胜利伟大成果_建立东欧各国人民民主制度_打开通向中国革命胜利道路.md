Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: The Pravda published an editorial on the 9th entitled "The Great Victory of the Soviet People" to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany. It stated that five years ago, under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people won a landmark victory, which was a victory of the socialist system over the capitalist system. The war strengthened the Soviet people's iron will and unwavering spirit. As Comrade Stalin said, "Our people have won the glory of a heroic people."

The great achievements of our victory are the establishment of people's democratic systems in Central and Southeast European countries, the liberation of Asian countries enslaved by imperialism, and the opening of the road to the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is a turning point in European history.

In the short span of five years, the world has been filled with many events of historical importance. The Soviet Union, advancing victoriously along the road of communism, is now closer to and more loved by the working people of the world. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have united under the banner of fighting for peace.

Aggressive policies can only lead warmongers to a failed ending. The victory of the Soviet people over Hitlerite Germany and Japanese imperialism is a stern warning to instigators of imperialist wars.

　　苏对德胜利伟大成果
    建立东欧各国人民民主制度
　　打开通向中国革命胜利道路
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报九日以《苏联人民的伟大胜利》为题发表社论，纪念战胜法西斯德国五周年称：五年前，苏联人民在列宁与斯大林党的领导下赢得了划时代的胜利，这是社会主义对资本主义制度的胜利。战争加强了苏联人民的钢铁意志与坚毅精神，如斯大林同志所说：我国人民已赢得了英雄人民的光荣。
    我们的胜利之伟大成果，便是中欧与东南欧各国人民民主制度的建立，便是解除了被帝国主义奴役的亚洲各国之解放运动的束缚，并打开了通向中国人民革命胜利的道路。而作为欧洲历史的转折点的，便是德意志民主共和国的成立。
    五年的短促时间内，世界上充满了许多具有历史重要性的大事。沿着共产主义道路胜利迈进的苏联，现在是更加靠近全世界劳动人民，并且更为他们所爱戴了。全世界亿万人民都已团结在为和平而斗争的旗帜之下。
    侵略政策只能使战争贩子赢得失败的结局，苏联人民对希特勒德国和日本帝国主义的胜利，便是对帝国主义战争挑拨者的严厉的警告。
