Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 2nd -- A rent reduction movement has been launched in more than one-half of the rural areas of Jiangxi Province. Since November of last year, under the urgent demands of the broad masses of peasants, the Provincial People's Government has been leading peasants to carry out rent reduction with a focus, combining it with the work of suppressing bandits, collecting grain, and opposing local bullies. Up to now, a movement of reasoning and explaining the law on rent reduction has been widely launched in more than one-half of the province's areas. According to incomplete statistics, the rent grain returned to the peasants from the rent reduction has reached 1.6 million *shi*. The areas where rent reduction has been completed are now fully transitioning to spring plowing and production, while the areas where it has not been completed are continuing to implement rent reduction with spring plowing and sowing as the center.

After the rent reduction in various regions, the class consciousness of the peasant masses has been universally improved, and they have enthusiastically participated in the militia and self-defense forces, and further transformed the rural political power. According to statistics, more than 93,000 peasants in the province have participated in the militia and self-defense forces; more than 4,800 village political powers have been transformed, basically establishing the political advantage of the peasant masses.

After obtaining the fruits of rent reduction, the peasants in various places have greatly increased their production enthusiasm, and the production movement has rapidly unfolded. In Suishi Township, Xinfeng County, the peasants in one *bao* dug 11 new water storage ponds, repaired 34 old ponds, and accumulated more than 30,000 *dan* of fertilizer within half a month after the rent reduction. The peasants in Suichuan County have also reclaimed more than 13,000 *mu* of wasteland.

　　江西广大农村展开减租
    树立了农民群众政治优势  农民生产积极性普遍提高
    【新华社南昌二日电】江西省农村二分之一以上的地区已展开减租运动。该省人民政府自去年十一月以来，即在广大农民的迫切要求之下，结合剿匪、征粮、反恶霸等工作，有重点地领导农民进行减租，到现在为止，全省已有二分之一以上的地区普遍展开了说理说法的减租运动。据不完全统计，农民从减租中退回的租粮已达一百六十万石。目前减租已结束地区正全力转入春耕生产，未结束地区则以春耕春种为中心，继续贯彻减租。
    经过减租的地区，农民群众阶级觉悟普遍提高，踊跃参加民兵和自卫队，并进而改造了乡村政权。据统计，该省参加民兵自卫队的农民已有九万三千余人；已经改造过的村政权亦有四千八百余个，基本上树立了农民群众的政治优势。
    各地农民在得到减租果实后，生产积极性大增，生产运动随即迅速展开。信丰县碎石乡一个保的农民在减租后的半个月内即新挖畜水池塘十一个，修理旧池塘三十四个，积肥三万余担。遂川县农民也已开荒一万三千多亩。
