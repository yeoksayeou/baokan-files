　　Do a Good Job in Grain Storage During the Rainy Season
　　China National Cereals Corporation Issues Instructions for May Work
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to strengthen grain storage work in various regions, the China National Cereals Corporation conducted inspections in conjunction with grain corporations at all levels in April and issued instructions for the central work in May. Currently, all regions are rectifying warehouses, turning, and drying grain. In the North China region, some areas have dried their grain two to three times, reducing the original moisture content of 80% of the stored grain from 18% to 20% to below 14%, reducing the risk of mold during the summer. However, some areas have experienced serious problems due to improper storage. For example, in Xuzhou, as much as 168,200 jin of grain was moldy and inedible; in Shandong, Shidao, Qingdao, Jinan, Zhangdian, and Henan's Luohe and other places have had fever and mold phenomena. With the rainy season approaching and the weather changing unpredictably, the company has issued the following instructions to its subordinates to ensure that the grain is not subject to any losses, and a storage summary must be made before the end of May: 1. Require all regions to ensure that all damp grain is dried to a moisture content of less than 13% before May 15. 2. Subordinates in each region should formulate storage measures based on local conditions and regulations on rewards and punishments for storage cadres. Mobilize cadres to actively protect grain and prevent sabotage by enemy agents. 3. Strengthen safety work during the rainy season: 1. Check whether the roof and surrounding areas of the warehouse have insect nests and rat holes, and whether there are any leaks or collapses. Timely repair and improve them. 2. New mats for stacks and piles must be covered with at least five to six layers, and skirt mats should be hung around them. The bottom should be padded with two layers of sleepers. If bricks are used, they must be built up to more than one foot and padded with firewood. 3. Move the piles and stacks in low-lying areas to higher places and dig drainage ditches in the freight yard. 4. After each rain, all warehouses, piles, and stacks must be thoroughly inspected, and problems should be dealt with in a timely manner.

　　中国粮食公司指示五月份工作
    【本报讯】中国粮食公司为加强各地粮食保管工作，于四月份结合各级粮食公司进行检查，并指示五月份中心工作。现各地都在进行整顿仓库，翻捣晾晒。华北区有的地区已晒过二次至三次，使所有百分之八十的存粮原含水量由百分之十八至二十降至百分之十四以下，减少夏季霉坏的危险。但亦有的因保管不当而发生了严重问题，如徐州霉坏不能吃用的粮食即达一六八、二○○斤之多；山东的石岛、青岛、济南、张店、河南漯河等地均有发热霉坏的现象。目前雨季将临，天气变化无常，该公司为保证粮食不受任何损失，特对所属指示以下几点，并须在五月底前作出保管总结：一、要求各地保证潮粮在五月十五日以前，一律晒到水份含量在百分之三十以下。二、各区所属应根据当地情况，制出保管办法，与保管干部的奖惩条例。发动干部积极护粮，防止奸特破坏。三、加强雨季安全工作：１、检查库房之顶棚周围有无虫穴鼠洞，破漏坍塌之处，应及时进行抹顶修补加以改善。２、垛囤新席至少须盖五至六层，周围并挂好裙席。底垫枕木两层用砖者须砌一尺以上，并铺垫柴草。３、低洼地方之囤垛，改移高处，并在货场掘好泄水沟。４、每次下雨后对所有库方囤垛，必须进行详细检查，发现问题及时处理。（中国粮食公司储运处）
