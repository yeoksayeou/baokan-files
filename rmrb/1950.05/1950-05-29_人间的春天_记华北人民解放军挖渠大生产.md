　　Spring in the Human World
    ——A Record of the North China People's Liberation Army's Ditch-Digging Mass Production
    By Our Correspondent Bai Yuan
    A Desolate Place
    In Shanyin County, Chahar Province, there are mountains to the north and mountains to the south. In the middle of these two mountain ranges lies an endless plain stretching from west to east. In the past, this was a desolate place. Due to the long-term devastation by the Japanese devils and Yan Xishan, and because the soil was full of salt and alkali, crops did not grow well, and the people's lives were extremely difficult. Usually, one mu of land could only yield one or two dou of grain. When drought and water shortage occurred, the crops would be quickly killed by the salt and alkali, creating large areas of wasteland. In many places, the ground was covered with salt and alkali, a vast expanse of white where even grass would not grow. Many farmers scraped piles of mud from this surface to boil salt and alkali, using the income to supplement their insufficient grain.
    "When the Qin-Jin Detachment and the Love-Your-Hometown Corps came, no more beggars were seen – they all disappeared." This short folk song is still circulating among the old folks here. It means that when Yan Xishan's "Qin-Jin Detachment" and "Love-Your-Hometown Corps" came, they all grabbed the starving people of this place to be soldiers and turned them into a gang of marauding rogues. "When Yan Xishan and the Japanese devils' armies came, they wanted everything – clothes, silver dollars, women's shoes, thread spools, everything," Guo Huai-shan, a farmer in Shanyin City, recounted the scene of those days, pointing to the tattered hat on his head, saying, "I bought this broken hat from the bandit army for six silver dollars back then. I don't know where they grabbed such a broken hat, took the people's things and sold them back to the people. You couldn't not buy it."
    The People Welcome the Victorious Army
    Since this place was liberated in 1946, the people have gained political freedom. The people here greeted their new years with bitter memories of the past and boundless excitement. However, the land here was indeed too bad. According to the nature of the land here, without river water irrigation, the lives of the people could not improve in any way. To the west of Shanyin County, the Sanggan River flowed turbulently from its source in Shuoxian through Shanyin, all the way to the east. But because there was no water conservancy construction, the river water could not irrigate the fields, and every year in summer and autumn, floods often occurred, causing great disasters to the people. Therefore, under the water conservancy construction plan of the People's Government, the People's Liberation Army, participating in production construction according to Chairman Mao's instructions, came batch after batch from garrisons hundreds of miles away to this place. According to the People's Government's water conservancy construction plan for this place, a large main canal was to be dug from the west of Shanyin City all the way east to Ying County, together with branch canals, totaling 300 li. In this way, on the one hand, 500,000 mu of land could be irrigated, and on the other hand, the volume of the Sanggan River could be regulated to prevent it from flooding. The ditch-digging project was mainly to be completed by the People's Liberation Army. Besides the bad land, the climate here was also particularly cold. In April, when the People's Liberation Army arrived here, the mountains were still covered with snow, and the ground was still frozen. The People's Liberation Army troops passed through Shanyin City and every village batch after batch every day, heading to various production outposts. The people watched these endless lines of troops with joy, standing in the streets and in the villages, saying they were "watching the victorious army." There were no rallies, no slogans, only an old couplet that a few families in Shanyin City had posted on their doors during the war: "Welcoming the Liberation Army with both hands; Chairman Mao is the great savior." Today, no words of this old couplet and the history of this place itself can better illustrate the feelings of the people here. In many villages, due to the poverty of the people's past lives, it was difficult to find a complete house. After the troops arrived in the villages, there were not enough houses to live in, so many families lived together, vacating their houses for the soldiers to live in. There were no mats on the kangs, so the villagers pulled down the mats used as roofing from the roofs to lay on the kangs for the soldiers.
    Spring in the Human World
    After the troops arrived at the various production outposts, they rested on the one hand and helped the villagers build mud houses on the other. In a few days, they helped the villagers transport all the manure from every village to the fields. After a few days of rest, ditch-digging began. Every day, they departed from Shanyin City and various villages to the canal line in neat formations, carrying baskets, shouldering shovels, and beating gongs and drums. On the endless plain, countless teams were on the move. According to normal years, because of the climate, the people here would not start spring plowing until the end of April. But this year they started half a month earlier. Firstly, because the troops helped them transport all the manure to the fields very early, and secondly, this year, in addition to plowing the existing land, they also had to plow a lot of land that had been deserted in the past, preparing for the troops to open the canal and then irrigate it with water. In this way, the land that had been deserted in the past would no longer be deserted.
    Every day, countless people's soldiers were scattered along the hundreds of li of canal line. In one division of the People's Liberation Army, everyone from the division commander to every commander and fighter participated. Many cooks cooked the meals at home and sent them to the canal, and once they arrived, they refused to return, jumping into the canal to dig with everyone. In the first few days, almost everyone had blisters all over their hands. They pricked them with needles, smeared them with some oil, and the next day they still dug as usual. Every day, each person was required to dig four cubic meters of earth. And in order to prevent the soldiers from being overworked and to avoid mutual challenges, when assigning projects in the troops, the entire company was assigned together, not by squad. But many people still dug five or six cubic meters of earth every day. Because the ground here was full of salt and alkali, the troops lived in the villages, and the water drawn from the wells was also salty and bitter. Many people had diarrhea after drinking the salty and bitter water. But they took medicine and were unwilling to rest for even one day. In many places under the canal, water would gush out less than one meter below the surface. After discovering water, they would keep digging down in that place with water, without resting or eating, until they dug that place into a large water storage pit, allowing the surrounding water to be absorbed into the water pit, and then leaving a levee to separate the water. But in some places, a meter below was water as deep as the lower leg, and there was no time to dig a water storage pit. So they soaked in several feet of salt water and alkaline water all day, shoveling down one shovel after another. In many places, ice was frozen under a layer of topsoil. They dug the soil away and let their feet step on the ice to dig.
    Learning While Working
    In the places where the soldiers worked every day, they pasted up the wall newspapers of each company and various cartoons drawn by the soldiers with cloth and inserted them on both sides of the canal. Next to each wall newspaper hung a literacy board with new characters that needed to be recognized that day. The soldiers brought their cultural textbooks, as well as self-bound literacy notebooks and diaries, to the ditch-digging site. When work started, they took off their coats and neatly placed them on both sides of the canal in the order of each company, with belts on top of the coats, hats on top of the belts, and pens, cultural textbooks, and various self-bound small learning notebooks inside the hats. When it was their turn to rest, they ran up from the canal, without even resting, immediately picked up their pens and notebooks, and quietly lay on the ground writing. Some were writing new characters, some were writing diaries, and some were compiling quick reports. They wrote so attentively that they didn't even pay attention to the wind and sand blowing in the wild. Sometimes a gust of sand fell on them where they were lying, covering their notebooks. They blew it away and continued writing. According to the new characters written on the literacy board, each person only needed to learn two new characters each day. But they often exceeded this number. Every day, after they learned the new characters on the literacy board, they asked the cultural instructor to teach them other characters according to their needs. In addition to literacy, those who could keep a diary had to keep a diary every day. In their diaries, through those simple sentences, one could intimately understand the soldiers' lives, thoughts, and feelings. On the first day of ditch-digging, one soldier's diary read:
    "When I got up, it was my turn to be on duty. After I got off duty, I brushed my teeth, washed my face, and ate. After breakfast, everyone gathered at the construction site to work. When I started digging, I liked it very much. But after digging for a while, my hands hurt a lot, and I didn't want to dig anymore. But when I thought about it, digging the canal was for the construction of the country, it was Chairman Mao's call, and I didn't feel anything anymore.
    "When the meal was delivered at noon, everyone finished eating unknowingly. Some comrades ate four or five bowls. I saw a comrade eating, and he finished a bowl of rice in two bites. I heard the sound of him eating, like the big pig we fed. At that time, I wanted to laugh, but because I had to eat, I just looked at him. When he finished eating, he asked the cultural instructor to teach me the character 'pain'.
    "When I was writing my diary, I heard a sound, and when I looked, a little bird flew in the sky. The sound it made was like the sound of the 'guoguo' in our place. When it flew in the sky, it looked like an airplane flying around, how beautiful! When it landed, it was like a bullet fired from a machine gun by our plane when we attacked Dingxing... ..."
    Joyful Songs Singing About Labor
    In addition to digging ditches and studying, the soldiers entertained themselves every day. During break times, those who could play shadow plays, those who could recite clapper talks, those who could sing drum songs, and those who could perform double acts organized entertainment teams. The sound of gongs and drums constantly resounded throughout the entire canal line. Each entertainment team sang back and forth on the embankments on both sides of the canal. They sang about the construction of the motherland, sang about the scene of this great labor, and sang about the model deeds of each company and each soldier. They transformed the shadow play into a magnificent song of labor. The person in front sang, and at the end of each section, everyone digging the ditch and the person playing the shadow play sang together with the rhythm of labor:
    "Hey! Look here, look here,
    See our Liberation Army engaging in production.
    Shedding blood and sweat for the motherland,
    Serving the people in every year and month, hey——
    Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulty,
    The Liberation Army sets an example in production.
    A happy life depends on our own efforts,
    Let's build the motherland together, hey——"
    When they sang about someone, the people digging the ditch watched his actions and posture while digging, and they improvised and sang. The person being sung about was happy and embarrassed. At this time, if the person being sung about was a more playful soldier, he would deliberately dig up a large shovelful of earth and throw it forcefully upwards, throwing the earth on the person playing the shadow play, mumbling something, and then continue to dig vigorously shovel after shovel; if the person being sung about was a soft-spoken soldier, he would lower his head, clench his lips tightly to hide the joy in his heart, and exert the greatest effort to dig, until the shadow play was finished singing about him and he sang about others, then he would use the energy he had just suppressed to loudly sing along with the end of the shadow play. The soldiers sang, dug, talked, and laughed, enjoying the pleasure of labor. In the first few days, they always called each of the last cubic meters of earth they dug Hainan Island, Taiwan, and Tibet. Every time they were about to finish digging, the soldiers would shout jokingly: "Hey, look! My Hainan Island is finished again!" One soldier shouted, and the second soldier followed suit: "Hey, look! My Taiwan is finished again!" When the news of the Liberation Army landing on Hainan Island reached here that day, the soldiers were even more excited. One soldier, while digging the earth, said, "Hey, look at the soldiers in the south, they dig even faster than us!"
    Thus, they dug day after day, section after section. Now, when you stand on that large main canal that is more than eight zhang wide and more than one zhang deep, and look past the smoothly constructed high embankments on both sides, you can see at a glance the countless teams, like the surging tide of the river, rolling up the tumbling mud on countless undulating waves, flooding towards the endless banks of the canal. From now on, what will flood will no longer be floods, but the happy lives of the people.

　　人间的春天
    ——记华北人民解放军挖渠大生产
    本报记者  白原
    一个荒凉的地方
    在察哈尔省的山阴县，北边一道山、南边一道山，这两道山的中间，从西往东，是一望无际的平原。在过去，这是一片荒凉的地方。由于日本鬼子和阎锡山的长期的摧残，并且土地里净是盐和碱、庄稼种不好，人民的生活困苦不堪。这里一亩地通常只能打一、二斗粮食，遇着天旱缺水，庄稼一下子就被盐和碱腌死，造成一大片一大片的荒地。有许多地方，地面上就铺满了盐和碱，白茫茫的一片，上面连草也不长。许多农民就在这上面刮起一堆堆泥土来熬盐和碱，以它的收入来补充不足的粮食。
    “来了秦晋支队、爱乡团，不见讨吃的——都走完。”这一首简短的民歌，至今还在这里的老百姓中间流传着。意思是说阎锡山的“秦晋支队”和“爱乡团”一来，通通把这个地方没有吃的老百姓都抓去当了兵，并把他们变成了一群烧杀抢掠的流氓。“阎锡山和日本鬼子的军队一来，衣服、白洋、女人的鞋子、线圪塔，什么都要。”山阴城的一位农民郭怀善叙述着当日的情景，并指着他头上载着的一顶破烂的帽子说：“我这顶破帽子还是那时候花了六毛白洋从匪军手里买来的。也不知道他们从那里抓来的这么一顶破帽子，拿了老百姓的东西就来卖给老百姓，不买还不成。”
    人民迎接胜利军
    自从一九四六年这个地方解放以后，人民在政治上获得了自由。这里的老百姓带着对过去的辛酸的回忆和无限的兴奋来迎接他们新的年月。但是，这里的土地也的确太坏。根据这个地方土地的性质，如果没有河水的灌溉，老百姓的生活无论如何也好不起来。在山阴县西面，一条桑乾河从它的发源地朔县滚滚的流过山阴，一直流向东方。但是因为没有水利的建设，河水无法灌到地里去，而且每年夏秋洪水常常泛滥，给老百姓造成极大的灾难。于是，在人民政府的水利建设计划下，依照毛主席的指示参加生产建设的人民解放军就一批一批的从几百里以外的驻地开到这个地方来。按照人民政府在这个地方的水利建设计划，从山阴城的西面挖一道大干渠，一直往东挖到应县，连支渠一起，需要挖三百华里。这样，一方面可以灌溉五十万亩土地，一方面可以调节桑乾河的水量，使它不致泛滥。挖渠工程主要就靠人民解放军来完成。这个地方除了土地不好以外，气候也特别寒冷。四月里，当人民解放军开到这里的时候，山上还披着雪，地底下还冻着冰。人民解放军的部队每天一批批的走过山阴城，走过每一个乡村，开到各个生产驻地去。老百姓带着欢乐的心情，成群结队的站在街头，站在村子里看着这些走不尽的队伍，说是“看胜利军”。没有开大会，也没有贴标语，只有山阴城里几家老百姓在战争时期就贴在门上的一副旧对联：“双手欢迎解放军；毛主席是大救星。”在今天，没有比这一副旧对联的字句和这地方本身的历史更能说明这里老百姓的心情。在许多村子里，由于老百姓过去生活的穷苦，很难找到一家完好的房子。部队来到村子以后，房子不够住，许多老百姓就两家人家并在一起住，把房子腾出来让给战士们住。炕上没有席子，老乡就把房顶上做顶篷的席子拉下来给战士们铺上。
    人间的春天
    部队到达各个生产驻地以后，一面休息，一面就给驻地的老百姓泥房子，并在几天当中，就帮助老百姓把每一个村子的粪都通通送到了地上。休息了几天以后，挖渠就开始了。每天，他们排着整齐的队伍，挑着筐篮，扛着铁锨，打着锣鼓从山阴城和各个村里出发到渠道线上去。在一望无际的平原上，无数的队伍在出动。按照平常的年月，因为气候的关系，这个地方的老百姓要到四月底才下地春耕。但是今年他们却提早了半个月。一来因为部队很早就帮他们把粪都送到了地里，二来他们今年除了把原有的地耕出来以外，还要将许多过去已经荒了的地也把它耕出来，准备部队开成渠以后即可引水灌溉。这样过去荒了的地也就不会再荒了。
    每天，在那几百里的渠道线上，散布着无数的人民的战士。在人民解放军的一个师里面，从师长到每一个指战员都通通参加。许多炊事员同志在家里煮好饭送到渠道上去，一去就不肯回来，也跳到渠里去和大家一起挖。在开始的几天，差不多所有的人两只手上都打满了泡，他们用针一挑，抹上点油，第二天还是照常的挖。每天规定每人挖四方土。并为了防止战士们过份疲劳，避免互相挑战，在部队里分配工程的时候，整个连在一起分，不以班为单位分。但许多人每天还是挖到五、六方土。因为这个地方地里净是盐和碱，部队住在村子里，从井里打出来的水也是咸水和苦水。许多人喝了咸水和苦水就泻肚子。但他们吃着药，也不愿意休息一天。在渠道底下，许多地方挖下不到一公尺就涌出水来。发现水以后，他们就在那个有水的地方一直不停的往下挖，休息也不休息，饭来了也不吃，直到把那地方挖成了一个储水的大坑，让周围的水都吸到水坑里面，然后留一道堤把水隔住。但有些地方，挖下一公尺就是小腿那么深的水，挖储水坑也来不及。于是他们就整天泡在好几尺深的盐水和碱水里面一锨一锨的往下挖。有许多地方，在上面一层土底下就冻着冰。他们把土挖开，就让双脚踩在冰上挖。
    一面劳动一面学习
    在战士们每天劳动的地方，他们把每一个连队的墙报以及战士们所画的各种各样的漫画用布贴上，插在渠道的两旁。在每一个墙报的旁边挂着一块识字牌，上面写着一天当中需要认识的生字。战士们把他们的文化课本，以及自己钉的识字本和日记本带到挖渠的地方。开工的时候，他们就把外衣脱下来，按着每一个连队的次序整整齐齐的摆在渠道的两旁，在外衣的上面放着皮带，皮带上面放着帽子，在帽子里面，就装着钢笔、文化课本和自己钉的各种学习小本子。轮到自己休息的时候，他们从渠道里跑上来，连歇也不歇，立刻就拿起钢笔和小本子，静静的伏在地面上写着。有的在写生字，有的在记日记，有的在编快报。他们写得这样用心，以至野地里刮起了风沙他们也不理会。有时候一阵沙土在他们躺着的地方刮下来，撒满了他们的小本子。他们用嘴一吹，又继续的写起来。按照识字牌上所写的生字，每天每人只需学会两个生字。但他们常常超过了这个数目。每天他们在学会了识字牌上的生字以后，就按照自己的需要再叫文化教员教他认其他的字。每天除了识字以外，能够记日记的还要记日记。在他们的日记本上，通过那些简单的字句，能够使人亲切的了解战士们的生活、思想和感情。在挖渠的第一天，一位战士的日记这样写着：
    “起床的时候正是我在岗的。下了岗我刷牙洗脸就吃饭。早饭吃完，大家集合到了工段上做工。在开始挖的时候，我很喜欢，挖的时间不大，手就很疼，心中不愿挖了，可是心中一想，挖渠是为了国家的建设，是毛主席的号召，心中就没有什么了。
    “中午送饭来的时候，大家不知不觉的就吃完了饭。有的同志吃了四五碗。我看见一位同志吃饭的时候，他吃了有两口就把一碗饭吃完了。我听到他吃的声音，好象咱们喂的大猪一样。当时我就想笑，可是因为要吃饭，我就把他看了一看。吃完的时候就叫文化教员教了我一个“疼”字。
    “当我正在记日记的时候，听到一个声音，看了看，天空中飞来一只小鸟。它叫的声音好象我们那里的“蝈蝈”叫的声音。它在空中飞的时候好象飞机一样飞来飞去，多么好看呵！它落下来的时候，就好象咱们打定兴时给敌人的飞机打机关炮的一颗子弹一样。………”
    欢乐的歌声歌唱着劳动
    战士们每天除了挖渠、学习，就是娱乐。在轮班休息的时候，会拉洋片的，会说快板的，会唱大鼓的以及会说双簧的就组织起娱乐小组来。不住的锣鼓响遍在整个渠道线上。每一个娱乐小组在渠道两旁的堤岸上来回的唱着。他们唱着祖国的建设，唱着这伟大的劳动的场面，唱着每一个连队的及每一个战士的模范事迹。他们把拉洋片改变成了一种雄伟的劳动的歌声，前边一个人唱着，在每一段的尾声，所有挖渠的人和拉洋片的人就一起随着劳动的节奏合唱起来：
    “嘿！往这里瞧来往这里看呀，
    看咱们解放军闹生产。
    为了祖国流血又流汗呵，
    那年那月也是为人民呀，咳——
    不怕苦来不怕难呀，
    解放军生产作模范。
    幸福的生活靠咱们来经营呵，
    建设祖国大家一起来吧，咳——”
    当他们唱到某一个人的时候，挖渠的人在底下一边挖，他们就看着他的动作和姿态，一边编一边唱。被唱的人又欢喜，又不好意思。这时候，如果被唱的是一个较为跳皮的战士，他就故意挖起一大锨土用力向上一扔，把土扔到拉洋片的人的身上，含含糊糊骂上一句什么，又继续用力一锨锨的挖着；如果被唱的是一个面软的战士，他就低着头，把嘴唇紧紧的合着来掩藏心里的喜欢，卖着最大的力气一个劲的挖，一直等到拉洋片的唱完了他再唱别人的时候，他就用他刚才蹩足了的那股劲随着拉洋片的尾声大声的合唱着。战士们一边唱着，一边挖着，一边又说又笑的在享受着劳动的愉快。开始那几天，他们总是把每一次挖到最后的土方叫做海南岛、台湾和西藏。每次挖到快完的时候，战士们就叫着开玩笑：“看嘿！我的海南岛又完了！”一个战士叫开，第二个战士又跟着叫：“看嘿！我的台湾又完了！”等到解放军在海南岛登陆的消息传到这里的那一天，战士们更是高兴的了不得。一个战士一边挖着土，一边就说：“嗨，你们看南方的战士们，比咱们挖的还快！”
    就这样，他们挖了一天又一天，挖了一段又一段。现在，当你站在那一道八丈多宽一丈多深的大干渠上，从那修得光溜溜的两道高大的堤岸中间望过去，你就可以一眼望见那数不尽的队伍，象澎湃的江潮一样，在无数起伏的浪头上卷起那翻滚的泥土，向着无尽止的渠道的两岸泛滥着。从此，泛滥的将不再是洪水，而是人民的幸福的生活。
