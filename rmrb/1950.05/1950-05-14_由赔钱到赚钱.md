　　From Losing Money to Making Money
    By Our Correspondent　Lin Mo
    The tram company has transformed from a loss-making entity to a profitable one. This is a major shift for the company. This transformation is the result of the company's Party, government, and labor union working in close coordination, establishing a strong leadership core, and the leading cadres beginning to recognize the power of the working masses and adopting a mass line in their work.
    When formulating the 1950 production plan, the company manager first reported the draft plan in detail at a meeting of production team leaders and foremen, explaining the company's situation and the goals of each department. Afterwards, the Party, government, and labor union systems separately mobilized employees to conduct in-depth discussions, formulate team or individual plans, and study specific methods for completing the plan. Workers at the power plant, in order to reduce coal consumption, carefully studied the coal feeding speed, sought to adjust wind power, sealed boiler wall seams and ash hopper leaks, and improved the superheater and cleaned the economizer. The company's boiler economizer had not been cleaned for twenty years. This time, 400 pounds of scale were removed, greatly improving the efficiency of coal combustion.
    When the repair and manufacturing plant began discussing the plan, workers expressed that past competitions had often started strong but fizzled out, with no summaries or rewards after the competition, and no one knowing who had done well. The leadership accepted the workers' opinions and publicly conducted self-criticism for past mistakes. While discussing the plan, they jointly formulated an over-quota reward method with the workers, decided to implement production registration, and strengthen the inspection system. In the past, due to a lack of planning, workers' jobs were not fixed, making it difficult to improve skills, and they were unclear about how much work they had done each month or day. This year, based on the plan, the amount of work was calculated in detail, and everyone was assigned tasks according to the work, and teams were reorganized, with each team and individual having specific numbers. Those who exceeded the task were rewarded. During the production process, workers who actively completed and exceeded their tasks were praised at any time, and the workers' production enthusiasm continued to increase. In the first quarter's summary, more than half of the workers exceeded their tasks and received rewards.
    In terms of the trolley routes, the biggest achievement was successfully operating the circular route. In the past, under Kuomintang rule, the circular route was attempted twice but failed both times. This time, based on everyone's opinions, the leadership improved the line equipment and working methods: adding turnouts to the single-track four-way route; installing clocks at important stops to enable drivers to accurately grasp the running time; changing the two-shift system for drivers to a three-shift system, shortening working hours; and equipping trams with kettles to solve the difficulties of drivers and conductors in eating, drinking water, and resting. Initially, many employees, given the previous two failures of the circular route, still lacked confidence in this attempt. After repeated mobilization and explanation by the leadership, and acceptance of everyone's opinions, the masses' confidence increased greatly. Drivers and conductors who operated the circular route volunteered to participate. They made every effort to ensure the smooth operation of the circular route, taking care of the vehicles and reducing breakdowns and accidents. Some drivers and conductors, after returning to the factory at twelve o'clock at night, would automatically inspect and clean the vehicles, saying, "We want to keep them as beautiful as young people forever!"
    Many facts show that workers and staff have a conscious sense of responsibility for protecting state property. For example, when the West Converter Station was repairing the reservoir, it was originally planned to contract it out. When workers in the civil engineering department heard that contracting it out would cost more than 50,000 catties of millet, they were distressed by the expense and asked the leadership to approve them doing it themselves. With the cooperative efforts of all workers and staff, the reservoir was completed according to plan, saving the company a large amount of expense.
    In addition, the tram company also established various specialized meetings, strengthened the planning and unified leadership of work, and overcame various chaotic phenomena. For example, the materials meeting specifically studied the system of material purchasing, storage, and requisition. For the materials to be purchased, a symposium of workers, technicians, and purchasing personnel was first convened to understand market prices and study the styles and quality of the goods to be purchased, and then unified purchases were made. Not long ago, they went to Tianjin to centrally purchase materials worth more than 200 million yuan, which were not only suitable but also 50 to 60 million yuan cheaper than buying them sporadically in Beijing. The storage of materials is currently being further changed from the past phenomenon of each department setting up small warehouses, which easily caused waste and damage. It is necessary to implement unified storage, inventory delivery to the warehouse, and improve the material issuance system. Other meetings, such as technical meetings and financial meetings, are regularly convened by relevant personnel from the company to study and solve various technical difficulties, and to systematically control financial revenue and expenditure and improve the economic accounting system. The joint meetings of vehicle route and factory cadres during this period better solved the coordination problems between the two parties. All of this has gradually put the tram company's work on track.

　　由赔钱到赚钱
    本报记者　林沫
    电车公司已由赔累变成赚钱了。这是该公司的一个大转变。这种转变，是该公司党政工团配合一致，树立了坚强的领导核心；领导干部开始认识了工人群众的力量，在工作中开始走了群众路线的结果。
    电车公司在制订一九五○年生产计划时，该公司经理首先在生产小组长和领班以上干部会议上，详细地报告了计划草案，讲明了公司情况和各部门的奋斗目标。此后，党政工团各系统分别发动职工深入讨论，制订了小组或个人计划，并研究了完成计划的具体办法。发电厂职工为减少燃煤，曾细心研究进煤速度，设法调整风力，泥封锅炉墙缝及灰斗漏风处，同时改进了蒸热器，洗刷了节热器。该公司锅炉节热器已二十年未清洗，此次清出了四百斤水锈，煤的燃烧效用大为提高。
    修造厂开始讨论计划时，工人纷纷反映：过去几次竞赛都是有头无尾，竞赛完了，领导上不总结，无奖励，谁干的好坏也不知道。领导上接受职工意见，对过去错误公开进行了自我检讨。并在讨论计划时，和职工共同制定了超额奖励办法，决定进行生产登记，加强检验制度。过去因工作缺乏计划，工人工作不固定，技术难以提高，又弄不清每月、每天干了多少活。今年则根据计划，详细计算了活计，大家按活分工，重新配备小组，每组每人都有具体数目。超过任务者奖励。在生产进行中，对积极完成和超过任务的工人随时表扬，工人生产情绪不断提高；第一季总结时，有半数以上的工人超额完成任务，得到了奖励。
    在车路方面，最大的收获是走好了环行路。过去在国民党统治时代，曾两次走环行路，都未走通。这次，领导上根据大家的意见，改善了线路设备和工作方法：在四路单轨增设了岔道；为使司机准确掌握行车时间，在重要站口设置了时钟；将行车人员的两班制改为三班制，缩短了工作时间；在电车上设备开水壶，解决了行车人员吃饭、饮水和休息的困难。最初，还有不少职工鉴于过去两次行驶环行均已失败，对这次走环行仍缺乏信心，经领导上多次动员讲解，并接受了大家的意见，群众信心倍增。走环行的司机和售票人员都是自愿报名参加的。他们在工作中尽一切努力保证环行的顺利，爱护车辆，减少坏车和事故。有些行车人员在夜里十二点回厂以后，还自动检查、擦洗车辆，他们说：“我们要永远让它象青年人一样的漂亮！”
    很多事实显示工人、职员对国家财产的爱护，有了自觉的责任心。如西变流场修蓄水池，原准备包给外人作，土木科工人听说包出去要花五万多斤小米，都心痛这笔开支，大伙要求领导上批准他们自己来作。在全体工人、职员合作努力之下，蓄水池按计划完成，为公司节省了大批开支。
    此外，电车公司并建立了各种专门会议，加强了对工作的计划性和统一领导，克服了各种混乱现象。如材料会议专门研究材料的购买、保管和领用制度。对要购买的材料，先召开工人、技术人员和采购人员的座谈会，了解市场价格，研究所购货品的式样、质量，然后统一购置。不久之前，他们到天津集中购买了价值两亿多元的材料，不但物材适用，且较在北京零星乱买便宜五、六千万元。对材料的保管，目前正进一步改变过去各部门设立小库房，容易引起浪费、损坏的现象。要实行统一保管，清点交库，并健全领发材料制度。其他如技术会议、财政会议，则是定期召集公司有关人员，研究解决各种技术上的困难，有计划地掌握财务收支和健全经济核算制。这一时期的车路、工厂干部联席会，更好的解决了双方的配合问题。这些都促使电车公司的工作逐渐走上轨道。
