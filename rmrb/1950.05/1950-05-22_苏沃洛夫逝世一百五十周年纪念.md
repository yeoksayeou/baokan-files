　　Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of Suvorov's Death
    Soviet Army Lieutenant Colonel Wei Nuoguluofu
    (Speech at the commemoration meeting co-organized by the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association of Beijing and the Soviet Foreign Culture Association in Beijing)

    Suvorov was a prominent Russian commander. From the day of his death to May 18th of this year, a full 150 years have passed. The entire Soviet Union is widely commemorating this memorable day. For this purpose, a special committee has been established, led by Soviet Marshal Sokolovsky.

    Suvorov's contribution to the motherland is immeasurable. He dedicated his entire life to consolidating the strength of his motherland.

    Suvorov had a passion for military affairs from a very young age. In 1748, at the age of eighteen, he began his service in the army, holding the rank of corporal. He served in the non-commissioned officer ranks for a total of six and a half years. During these years, he was in close contact with the soldiers.

    Suvorov was accustomed to being with ordinary people from childhood. He was able to get along with the "lower classes." He treated ordinary Russian soldiers as people and as patriotic warriors. He valued the courage, perseverance, and endurance of soldiers. He could explain any problem to soldiers in the most ordinary language, and he could encourage soldiers with jokes.

    He diligently performed his duties in the ranks. At that time, he insisted on continuing his studies.

    In the spring of 1754, Suvorov was promoted to officer and appointed as a lieutenant in an infantry regiment.

    In 1756, the historically famous "Seven Years' War" began. Russia joined the war against Prussia.

    Suvorov was assigned to serve in the actual combat troops. He participated in the march on Berlin, and he performed particularly well in the battle to capture the city of Kolberg.

    Suvorov received his baptism as a commander here. Suvorov always stood at the forefront of the cavalry he commanded. He used his bravery to inspire and encourage the soldiers. With irresistible heroic attacks, he instilled fear and dread in the enemy. He was invincible. Prussian troops did not expect him to appear where he did. He would always appear there. His offensives were rapid and swift, his mobility was agile, and his combat foresight was accurate. This ensured that he could quickly and completely defeat the enemy.

    The Russian army's capture of Kolberg was the final act of the Russian-Prussian War from 1756 to 1762.

    The results of this war were enormous: it influenced the entire political life of Europe in the late 18th century. Russia's power and influence grew dramatically, while the competing and opposing forces were conversely reduced. Prussia was exhausted, weakened, and politically isolated.

    The international situation created by the outcome of this war helped Russia to solve some existing historical tasks.

    In the course of the war, the Russian army accumulated a great deal of experience and produced many talented commanders, the most outstanding of whom was Suvorov. He prepared the Russian army to embark on the road to victory, marking the latter half of the 18th century.

    In 1768, under the instigation of France and Austria, Turkey launched a war against Russia, the Russo-Turkish War. Suvorov played a significant role in this war.

    The army he led defeated the Turkish army in the Turtukai and Hirsov regions.

    On June 21, 1774, the great victory won by Suvorov's army at Kozludzha marked the end of the war, where he defeated 40,000 enemies with 8,000 Russian troops.

    Suvorov was the first organizer to strengthen the fortifications on both sides of the Ahthiar Gulf. In 1773, by order of General Potemkin, preparations were made to establish the city and port of Sevastopol, which later became one of the famous heroic cities in Russian history.

    The second Russo-Turkish War occurred as a result of the Turkish Sultan's attempt to restore his regime on the northern coast of the Black Sea. Suvorov also achieved great victories in this war.

    In the Battle of Kinburn, he defeated 6,000 Turkish landing troops with 3,000 Russian troops, disrupting the Turkish command's attack plan. Later, in the Fokshany region, he defeated 30,000 enemies with 25,000 Russian troops, and in the Rimnik region, he defeated 100,000 enemies.

    On December 22, 1790, Suvorov's army captured the Izmail fortress. The assault on the Izmail fortress demonstrated the commander's talent and the soldiers' unparalleled heroism. Such an achievement could only be accomplished by his army, because every soldier under his leadership valued victory more than his own life.

    The fall of the Izmail fortress crushed the enemy's resistance. Suvorov participated in the peace negotiations held in Jassy, which were completed with the signing of a treaty favorable to Russia.

    In 1794, during the lightning war against Poland, Suvorov had already been promoted to marshal.

    In 1799, Russia joined the alliance of powers and began the war against France. The British and Austrian governments suggested to the Russian Emperor Paul that Suvorov be appointed commander of the Allied forces to attack the French army occupying Italy.

    Between April and August of 1799, the army led by Suvorov achieved victories. The French army, which had always been called invincible, was defeated, and the remnants of the French army were driven out of northern Italy. In September 1799, the Russian army liberated Rome from the invaders and entered the city of Rome.

    The Austrian command attempted to exploit the fruits of the Russian army's victory to benefit Austria, and suggested that Suvorov's army be transferred north to liberate Switzerland, while the Austrian army withdrew from there, leaving only a Russian corps led by Rimsky-Korsakov, which was isolated there.

    In order to rescue the Russian troops remaining in Switzerland, Suvorov had to find a way to get these troops across the Alps in a very short time. The organizational plan of the Swiss campaign, the implementation of the campaign, and the results of the campaign are world-renowned.

    Suvorov's victories in Italy, his high military art, the heroism of his army, and the Swiss campaign were all praised and admired by the world for this great commander.

    The real examples of Suvorov defeating the enemy are not limited to the above. The victories he achieved added to the honor and greatness of Russia.

    The military education foundation laid by Suvorov is still followed in many ways in the Soviet army today. Suvorov trained the army only for what was needed in war, so he often conducted exercises close to actual combat in peacetime. "Soldiers must be in a state of war even in peacetime"—this was Suvorov's rule. His military education views in his time were truly revolutionary in the military field.

    Suvorov trained the army and taught the soldiers to have the idea that the ultimate goal of combat was to annihilate the enemy. He once said, "Whoever resists me must die," "Letting the enemy retreat is a failure, annihilating the enemy is success."

    At this time, Suvorov compiled a manual, which was the beginning of his famous "Science of Victory." From 1794 to 1796, it summarized all of Suvorov's great military experience, and the "Science of Victory" was finally revised and published.

    Suvorov's education system was built on the high evaluation of the soldiers he led. He said more than once, "For me, soldiers are more precious than myself." Suvorov did everything possible to develop the soldiers' initiative, self-esteem, and to coordinate with military discipline, courage, wit, and combat skills. Suvorov once taught soldiers, "Every soldier should understand his own mobility," "Strike the enemy with wit, not with numbers."

    The great commander taught, "Prepare for peace during war, prepare for war during peace."

    He trained soldiers to be steadfast and mobile. Every soldier must be fully proficient in the use of his weapons. Artillery and infantry must be trained to shoot accurately. When the artillery cannot shoot, the infantry and cavalry need special attention, because at that time, when the artillery firepower is not complete, we must inflict greater damage on the enemy with close combat. Our soldiers must accurately eliminate the enemy. The Suvorov army's bayonet charge and attacks on the enemy will certainly completely defeat the enemy. Suvorov had every reason to say, "Due to the bravery of the Russian army, no army can fail to be subdued."

    Suvorov trained the army, preparing everything to meet the needs of war at any time. He trained the army to be able to act in any situation, to act quickly, and to reliably complete the mission given.

    Suvorov's command talent not only depended on the organizational and technical perfection of the army, not only depended on the army's good training and mobility, but its main foundation lay in the combat will and morale of each soldier in the army he led. The hero of the Patriotic War of 1812, Davydov, criticized Suvorov's model, saying that Suvorov put his hand on the heart of the Russian soldier to study his heartbeat. He knew there the soldiers' obedience to their superiors, which had reached perfection in our army. He made the benefits brought by obedience increase tenfold. He melted the soldiers' military pride and the confidence of being superior to any soldier in the world into the soldiers' spirit. This feeling of pride and confidence is endless.

    Engels praised Suvorov as a "commander and soldier," which is very reasonable. This great commander always called himself a soldier. He said more than once, "I am a soldier, I don't care about race or lineage." Every soldier in the Russian army saw a model of a soldier in Suvorov. Everyone knew that Suvorov believed that soldiers were more precious than himself. He cared about the health and life of the soldiers, so the soldiers led by Suvorov were sure to win. Suvorov's closeness to the soldiers and the soldiers' love for Suvorov were most evident in the most difficult stages of the battle. It could increase the strength of the army and the courage of the soldiers. Suvorov was proficient in the general language of the people. Many maxims of this people's hero are permanently preserved in the lives of the vast soldiers of the Russian army.

    Just cite the following maxims: such as "Learning is going to the light, not learning is going to the darkness"

    "Nothing is difficult in the world, only afraid of people with a heart"

    "Learning is difficult, marching is easy, learning is easy, marching is difficult"

    "The more comfortable, the less courage"

    "To attack the enemy with wit, not with quantity"

    "Discipline is the mother of victory"

    "Shoot fewer bullets, but be accurate, bayonets must stab the enemy forcefully"

    "Ears are frozen, wipe them with snow, when people are timid, use danger to cure him"

    "Meet danger, don't wait for danger"

    "Sacrifice yourself to help your friends"

    "Endure the difficulties of war, don't be depressed when unsuccessful."

    "Speed is needed, but haste is harmful"

    "The victor must be generous and merciful"

    The principles of Suvorov's education system were widely adopted in the Russian army. This education system was re-examined in the 1860s based on the experience of the Seven Years' War.

    The hard work of Suvorov, Rumyantsev, Potemkin and their comrades improved the organization and armaments of the Russian army, prescribed lightweight uniforms, simplified manuals, and eliminated some useless and cluttered articles.

    Suvorov far surpassed his era in military art. Although he was constrained by jealous and incompetent officers, and although he was unable to organize the work that should be prepared for war as he wished, he had already demonstrated his brilliant military genius in the so-called military and diplomatic crossfire.

    Suvorov was the reformer of Russian military art and the direct successor of Peter the Great and Rumyantsev.

    At that time, the line tactics were the most popular in foreign countries, especially in Prussia. The line tactics of the 18th century inevitably reduced the flexibility and mobility of the army and reduced the mobility of small units. Prussia insisted on this array because this array could completely supervise the soldiers.

    Peter the Great gave another way of military organization, another strategy. During the Seven Years' War, military commanders such as Rumyantsev and Saltykov adopted Peter's instructions and successfully developed them. They carefully considered the characteristics of the Russian army and made good use of these characteristics.

    Under their leadership, in combat, the Russian army not only used line-style combat deployments, but also used battalion column-style deployments, and sometimes implemented skirmish line operations. Various combat deployments and the high morale of the Russian army enabled them to fight on any terrain, and whether it was day or night, they often adopted close combat, which ultimately created greater convenience for their mobility.

    After carefully studying the military doctrine of line combat deployment, Suvorov resolutely refused to adopt it.

    According to his own strategic system, Suvorov re-evaluated the past tactical skills, military training issues, education issues, etc.

    Suvorov's military art is not a rigid regulation, it always has original characteristics, Suvorov's creative talent is endless.

    Suvorov was able to distinguish the specific circumstances and characteristics of each battle and use them to fit his own tactics.

    He paid attention to the terrain, the national characteristics of the enemy, and the weapons used by the enemy. His way of fighting the Turkish army was different from the way he fought the Polish army, and fighting the French army was different from fighting the Turkish army.

    Suvorov's command skills are the classical way of using military psychology.

    Suvorov resolutely opposed regulations and blindly using rigid regulations. Suvorov required his subordinates to do the same, requiring them to exercise independent judgment according to the situation.

    Suvorov resolutely opposed citing rigid articles for any objective reason.

    According to Suvorov's opinion, only offensive warfare can achieve the purpose of defeating the enemy, but he did not oppose the tactic of defense when the military strength was too disparate, but in this case, active defense must be implemented.

    The greatest characteristic of Suvorov's art of commanding troops is not being afraid of being surrounded by the enemy.

    Suvorov strived to conduct coordinated operations. He required the commanders to have the closest possible coordination with each other, to quickly reinforce each other in difficult situations, and to use all their energy to defend the positions of friendly forces, just like defending their own positions. He always divided out reserves, which could be used successfully in emergencies. Line tactics cannot understand the value of reserves.

    With the help of Suvorov's extraordinary influence on the army, in the army's love and belief in him, he could achieve all the goals he expected. Under Suvorov's inspiration, the soldiers forgot about hardship, hunger, hardship, and cold. The combat will and morale of the army can overcome everything.

    Suvorov and the soldiers of the Russian army were one. He could not only understand the soldiers, but also be the expression of their spirit. Suvorov's military art is deeply national, and for this reason, it can be immortal. The principles of Suvorov's military art are forever in the soldiers of the army.

    Generation after generation of the Russian army has passed on Suvorov's instructions to our days, and his instructions have been developed in the new circumstances of the Red Army's combat achievements in the Great Patriotic War against fascist Germany and Japanese aggressors, raising the honor of our armed forces to an unprecedented height.

    Comrade Bulganin pointed out in his report "Thirty Years of the Soviet Armed Forces": Soviet military science has absorbed the essence of past military art.

    The Suvorov Military Medal is awarded to the famous generals of our army, making them inherit Suvorov's instructions and move towards new goals in a victorious manner. These methods are to fight for the welfare, glory, and dignity of the motherland, to fight for heroism and self-sacrifice, to fight for high combat skills and complete mastery of military technology, and to forever leave behind the guarantee of victory and the immortal honor of people like Suvorov.

    Suvorov believed that the strength of Russia was endless and had a great future. He often said "I am Russian, I am proud". He saw his own honor in the glory of Russia. His soldiers were the same, and he left this to later generations.

    Suvorov taught us to never stop at the achievements we have already achieved. He called for emulating the models of the great figures of the past, not only striving to be like them, but also to surpass them. He praised Peter the Great and Rumyantsev as his teachers, but he wanted to surpass them in military art. Suvorov wanted his descendants to be able to surpass him.

    Under the genius leadership of the great Stalin, the heroic Red Army raised military art and the military honor of our motherland to unprecedented heights. Such a great army is an army unprecedented in human history. It defeated and overthrew fascist Germany, raised the banner of victory over Berlin, and then resolutely defeated Japanese imperialism.

    Even our ancestors shared the glory of this victory with us.

    During the war, Suvorov's model inspired our people to carry out heroic and self-sacrificing struggles to defeat the enemy. In his speech on November 7, 1941, Comrade Stalin spoke about the names of our great predecessors, including Suvorov, saying that this model will always live among us, and will always live in the days of new glory and honor of our motherland.

    The Soviet Union, represented by its government on behalf of all the people, formulated three levels of medals to forever commemorate this great Russian commander.

    The future commanders are educated in the name of Suvorov.

    On August 22, 1943, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) passed a direct resolution on the method of restoring the economy in areas that had been occupied by German troops. This resolution stipulated that:

    In order to establish, train and educate the children of Red Army soldiers, the children of Patriotic War guerrillas, and the children of Soviet party and government workers, workers, and collective farmers who died during the German aggression, nine old-style intermediate Suvorov military schools should be established, each with 500 students, a total of 4,500 students, with a training period of seven years, and strict boarding training should be carried out.

    At present, the number of Suvorov military schools has increased to fifteen. The task of the Suvorov military schools is to provide them with a general secondary education, while preparing them for military service education as officers.

    Using the name of the great Russian commander as the name of the military school has a profound meaning. This means that they must develop the Suvorov spirit, and here, commanders with military skills are prepared, and people with advanced military ideas are trained. Emphasizing that the Red Army worships Suvorov's tradition.

    Poet, writer, diplomat, military leader, invincible commander, this is Suvorov's model. He is one of the most prominent representatives of the Russian people. He has been dead for one hundred and fifty years, and he can still radiate infinite light with his talent.

　　苏沃洛夫逝世一百五十周年纪念
    苏联陆军中校  魏诺古罗夫
    （在北京苏联对外文化协会北京市中苏友好协会合办的纪念会上讲词）
    苏沃洛夫是俄国的杰出的统帅，从他逝世的那天起到今年五月十八日止，整整满了一百五十年。全苏联都广泛地来纪念这个值得纪念的日子，为了这个目的，创立了一个特别委员会，由苏联元帅索阔洛夫斯基来领导主持。
    苏沃洛夫对于祖国的功绩，是难以评价的，他把自己的全部生命，供献出来使自己祖国的力量巩固起来。
    苏沃洛夫在很小的时候，就爱好军事。在一七四八年当他十八岁的时候，开始在军中服务，担任下士的职务，他在军士阶级的阶段里，总共服务了六年半，在这些年里，他和士兵们相处得很亲密。
    苏沃洛夫从童年起，就习惯与普通人民相处，他能够和“下等人们”谈得来，他对待普通俄国士兵，是以对人和对爱国战士的态度来对待，他很重视士兵的勇敢、坚苦和忍耐性，他能以最普通的话语，给士兵们解释任何的问题，他能以玩笑方式来鼓励士兵。
    他勤奋地执行了队列上的职责，在那个时候，他坚持继续进行着学习。
    一七五四年春天的时候，苏沃洛夫升为军官，被委任为步兵团里的中尉。
    一七五六年，在历史上有名的“七年战争”开始了，俄国参加了对普鲁士的战争。
    苏沃洛夫被派到实际作战的部队里服务，他参加了对柏林的进军，他在攻占阔里别尔哥城的战役里，表现得特别优异。
    苏沃洛夫是在这里接受了作统帅的洗礼，苏沃洛夫在自己所指挥的骑兵队里，永远是站在最前列，他以自己的勇敢，来诱导鼓励着士兵。他以不可阻挠的英勇的袭击，使敌人感到惊恐和胆寒。他所向无敌，普鲁士的军队没有预料他能来的地方，他永远会在那里出现的。他的进攻是迅速而急进的，其机动性是敏捷而作战预见是准确的，这使他一定能够迅速而完全地击溃敌人。
    俄军攻占阔里别尔哥是一七五六年到一七六二年俄普战争最后终局的一幕。
    这个战争的结果收获非常大：它影响了十八世纪后期欧洲整个的政治生命，俄国的威力和影响激烈地增长起来，而和俄国相竞争的敌对力量相反地减低了。普鲁士已经疲惫、衰弱了，政治上也孤立了。
    这个战争结果所造成的国际局势，协助了俄国来解决一些存有的历史上的任务。
    在战争的过程中，俄国军队积聚了很大的经验后在战争中产生了不少天才的指挥官，其中最杰出的就是苏沃洛夫。他准备了使俄国军队走上胜利的道路，用以来作十八世纪后五十年代的标志。
    一七六八年，土耳其在法奥的指使下，进行着反对俄国而发生了俄土战争，在这次战争里，苏沃洛夫起了很重大的作用。
    他所领导的军队，在土尔土卡牙和集尔寿夫地区击溃了土耳其军队。
    一七七四年六月二十一日，苏沃洛夫所领的军队，在库兹鲁集所获得的巨大胜利，标志着战争的结局，在那里他以八千俄军击溃了四万敌人。
    苏沃洛夫是第一个加强阿何基福斯克海湾两岸防御工事的组织者。这个海湾在一七七三年，按照波将金将军的命令，准备建立起塞瓦斯托波尔城和海港，这个海港尔后在俄国历史上成了著名英雄城市之一。
    第二次俄土战争的发生，是由于土皇苏丹企图在黑海北岸恢复自己政权统治的结果。苏沃洛夫在这次战争里，也获得了巨大的胜利。
    在金布尔恩斯克战役里，他以三千俄军击溃了六千土耳其的登陆部队，他破坏了土耳其统帅部的攻击计划，尔后又在福克山地区，以两万五千名俄军击溃了三万的敌人，在雷木尼克地区击溃了十万敌人。
    一七九○年十二月二十二日，苏沃洛夫的军队攻占了依兹玛依尔要塞。在进攻依兹玛依尔要塞时，表现出来了统帅的才能和士兵的无比英勇。这种成就只有他的军队才能达成，因为他所领导的每个士兵，对于胜利的评价高过了自己的生命。
    依兹玛依尔要塞的攻陷，摧毁了敌人的抵抗。苏沃洛夫他参加了在牙沙何所举行的和平的谈判，谈判是在有利于俄国的条约上签字下完成的。
    一七九四年对波兰所进行的闪电式战争的时候，苏沃洛夫已经升为元帅了。
    一七九九年俄国加入了列强联盟，开始了对法战争。英奥两国政府向俄皇帕维尔建议委任苏沃洛夫为联军统帅，以进攻占领意大利的法军。
    在一七九九年四月到八月的中间，苏沃洛夫所领导的军队获得了胜利，一向称被为不可战胜的法军被击溃了，法军的残余也在意大利北部被驱逐出去了。一七九九年九月，俄军从侵略者手里解放了罗马，并且进入了罗马城。
    奥军司令部企图利用俄军胜利的果实有利于奥国，建议将苏沃洛夫军队北调去解放瑞士，同时奥军却从那里撤出，在那里仅留有里姆斯基阔尔沙阔夫所领导的一个俄国军团，这部俄军在那里处于孤立的地位。
    苏沃洛夫为了解救在瑞士留存的俄国军队，必须要设法使这军队在非常短的时间里，越过阿尔卑斯山脉。瑞士进军的组织计划，进军的实施和进军的结果是举世闻名的。
    苏沃洛夫在意大利所获得的胜利，他的高度的军事艺术，他的军队的英勇和瑞士的进军等等，使全世界对这位伟大的统帅，都加以称颂和赞扬。
    苏沃洛夫战胜敌人的实在例子，还不只以上所说的，他所获得的胜利，增加了俄国的荣誉和伟大。
    苏沃洛夫所打下的军事教育基础，现在在苏联军队里，在好多方面，还追随着它。苏沃洛夫训练军队，只训练在战争中所需要的，所以平常要常常进行接近实际作战的演习。“士兵在平时也要处于战争状态”——这就是苏沃洛夫的规律。他在他自己时代里所持的军事教育观点，在军事事业方面，是具有真正的革命性的。
    苏沃洛夫训练军队，教给士兵们须有这种思想，就是：战斗最终的目的，要歼灭敌人。他曾经说：“谁反抗我，谁就得死”“让敌人退走了，就是失败，把敌人歼灭了，才是成功”。
    在这个时候，苏沃洛夫编制了操典，这就是他所作的出名的“致胜科学”的初步，一七九四年到一七九六年，总合了苏沃洛夫一切巨大的军事经验，最后校订出版了这部“致胜科学”。
    苏沃洛夫的教育制度，建筑在他所领导的士兵的高度评价上。他不止一次地说：“对于我来说，士兵比我自己还宝贵”。苏沃洛夫尽各种方法来发展士兵的自发性，自尊心，并且要配合着军纪，勇敢，机智和战斗技术。苏沃洛夫曾经这样教导士兵说：“每一个士兵都应该明白自己的机动性”，“应该以机智来打击敌人，不要以数量多来求胜利”。
    伟大的统帅教导着说：“战争时期要准备和平，和平时期要准备战争”。
    他教练着士兵要有坚忍性和机动性。每一个士兵必须完全熟练使用自己的武器。要训练炮兵和步兵准确的射击。当炮兵不能射击的时候，步兵和骑兵需要特别注意，因为在那个时候，在炮兵火力不完全的时候，我们要以肉搏给予敌人更大的损害，我们的士兵要准确地来消灭敌人。苏沃洛夫军队的肉搏冲锋和对敌的袭击，一定能够完全击溃敌人，苏沃洛夫有一切根据地说：“由于俄国军队的英勇，任何军队是不能不被屈服的”。
    苏沃洛夫训练着军队，准备着一切，随时可以达成战争的需要。他训练着军队在任何情况下都有进行动作的能力，训练军队行动迅速，并且要确实完成所给予的使命。
    苏沃洛夫统帅的天才，不只依赖着军队在组织上和技术上的完善，不只依赖着军队良好的训练和机动性，而其主要的基础在于他所领导的军队作战意志和每个士兵的士气。一八一二年卫国战争的英雄达维斗夫批评苏沃洛夫的典型他说苏沃洛夫把手放在俄国士兵的心上，来研究他的心的跳动，他在那里知道了士兵们对长官的服从，这种服从在我们的军队里是达到完善的地步，他使服从所带来的利益，增加了十倍，他把士兵的军事骄傲和比世上任何士兵都优越的自信，融化在士兵的精神里，这种骄傲和自信的感情是无穷尽的。
    恩格斯称道苏沃洛夫是“统帅兼士兵”，这是很有道理的。这个伟大的统帅永远称自己是个兵。他不只一次地说：“我是个兵，我不管什么种族和门第”。俄国军队每个士兵在苏沃洛夫身上看到了兵的模范。所有的人都知道苏沃洛夫是认为士兵比他自己宝贵的，他关怀着士兵的健康和生活，所以苏沃洛夫领导的士兵一定打胜仗。苏沃洛夫对士兵的亲近和士兵对苏沃洛夫的爱戴，在战役中最困难的阶段中表现着最伟大，它能增加了军队的力量和士兵的勇敢。苏沃洛夫精通人民一般的话语，这个人民英雄的很多格言永久留存在俄国军队广大士兵的生活里。
    就举出以下些格言：如“学习是走向光明，不学习是走向黑暗”
    “天下无难事，只怕有心人”
    “学习时艰难，进军时则容易，学习时容易，进军时则艰难”
    “舒适愈多，勇气愈少”
    “要以机智袭敌，不可依数量胜敌”
    “纪律是胜利之母”
    “少发子弹，但求准确，刺刀要有力地刺杀敌人”
    “耳朵冻了，用雪来擦，人胆小时，要用危险治他”
    “要迎接危险，不要等待危险”
    “要牺牲自己，帮助友人”
    “在战争的困难中要忍耐，不成功时不要忧郁。”
    “迅速是需要的，但匆忙是有害的”
    “战胜者，要宽大仁慈”
    苏沃洛夫教育制度的原则，在俄国军队里，被广泛地采用着，这种教育制度是在六十年代里根据七年战争的经验被重新审定的。
    苏沃洛夫、鲁缅泽夫、波将金及和他们战友的勤劳，改善了俄国军队的组织和武装，规定了轻便的军服，简便的操典，取消了一些无用而杂乱的条文。
    苏沃洛夫在军事艺术方面，远远地超越了自己的时代，他虽然受了嫉妒的无能的长官的束缚，虽然他没有能够尽心所欲的把战争所应准备的工作组织起来，但是在所谓军事和外交交义炮火当中，他已经表现出来了他的灿烂的军事天才。
    苏沃洛夫是俄国军事艺术的改造者，是彼得第一和鲁缅泽夫的直系承继人。
    在当时，一线战术在外国，尤其是在普鲁士是最盛行的，十八世纪的一线战术不可避免地减少了军队的灵活性和运动性，减低了小部队的机动性。普鲁士坚持着这种阵列，因为这种阵列可以完全监督着士兵。
    彼得第一给予了另外一种军事上的组织方式另外一种的战略。在七年战争期间，像鲁缅泽夫和沙尔德阔夫等军事统帅们采纳了彼得的遗训，并且把它顺利地发展了。他们很仔细地考虑了俄国军队的特性，并且很好地运用了这种特性。
    在他们的领导下，俄国军队在交战中，不仅使用一线式的战斗部署，并且使用了营纵队式的部署，有时还实行散兵线的作战法。各式的战斗部署和俄军高度的士气，使他们能在任何的地形上，以及无论是在白天或黑夜都能进行战斗，使他们常常采用肉搏战，最后造成了他们机动上的更大的方便。
    苏沃洛夫仔细地研究了一线战斗部署的军事学说以后，断然拒绝采用它。
    苏沃洛夫根据自己的战略系统，对于以往的战术技巧、军事训练问题、教育问题等等的观点，重新地进行了评价。
    苏沃洛夫的军事艺术不是死板的规定，它永远是具有独创特点的，苏沃洛夫的创造才能是无穷尽的。
    苏沃洛夫能够区别出每个战斗的具体情况和所具有的特点，用以来符合使用自己的战术。
    他注意地形，敌军的民族特性和敌人所使用的武器，他和土耳其军队作战的方式和与波兰军队作战方式就不同，而和法军作战又与和土军作战方法不同。
    苏沃洛夫的指挥技巧是利用军事心理学的古典式方式。
    苏沃洛夫坚决反对规条，反对盲从地使用着刻板的规定，苏沃洛夫要求着自己的部属也这样做，要求他们实行着依情况的独断专行。
    苏沃洛夫坚决反对以任何客观理由来引用死板的条文。
    依照苏沃洛夫的意见，只有攻击战才能达到战胜敌人的目的，但他对于军事力量过于悬殊时，而实行防御的战术并不反对，但是在这种情况下，必须行积极性的防御。
    苏沃洛夫的指挥军队的艺术，最大的特性，是不怕敌人的包围。
    苏沃洛夫努力于进行协调合作的战役，他要求各指挥官彼此间要有最紧密的协同动作，在困难的情况下相互间要迅速地予以增援，对于友军阵地的防守，也要使用全部精力，要像和防守自己阵地一样。他永远是划分出预备队，在紧急情况时，可以顺利地使用它。一线战术是不能理解到预备队的价值的。
    苏沃洛夫在自己对军队的非寻常的影响帮助下，在军队对他的爱戴和确信下，可以达成一切自己所期望的目的。士兵们在苏沃洛夫的鼓舞下，忘掉了艰苦、饥饿、辛劳和寒冷。军队的作战意志和士气能克服一切。
    苏沃洛夫和俄国军队的士兵是一体的，他不仅能够理解士兵，并且还是他们精神的表现者。苏沃洛夫的军事艺术是具有深刻的民族性的，正因为这个原故，才能永垂不朽。苏沃洛夫军事艺术的原则，在军队的士兵们里是永存的。
    俄罗斯军队一代又一代地把苏沃洛夫的遗训传到了我们的日子里，而他的遗训在反对法西斯德国和日本侵略者的伟大卫国战争里，在红军战斗功绩的新的情况中发展起来，把我们武装力量的荣誉，提高到前所未有的高度。
    布尔加宁同志，在“苏维埃武装力量三十年”的报告里指出：苏联军事科学吸收了过去军事艺术的精萃。
    苏沃洛夫军事勋章是奖励给我们军队的著名将领的，使他们承继着苏沃洛夫的遗训，以胜利的方式走向新的目标。这些方式就是为了祖国的福利、光荣和威严而斗争，为了英勇和自我牺牲而斗争，为了高度战斗技巧和完全精通军事技术而斗争，永远遗留下胜利的保障和苏沃洛夫一流人物的不朽的荣誉。
    苏沃洛夫相信了俄国力量是无穷尽的，是有伟大前程的，他常说“我是俄国人，我很骄傲”，他在俄国的光荣里，看到了自己的荣誉。他的士兵们也是这样，他把这一点，遗留给后代的人们。
    苏沃洛夫教给我们永远不要停留在已经获得的成就上。他号召了要效法过去的伟大人物的典型，不仅努力要向他们看齐，并且还要超越过他们。他称道彼得大帝和鲁缅泽夫是自己的老师，而在军事艺术上要超越过他们。苏沃洛夫愿意自己的后代人们能够超越过他。
    英勇红军在伟大斯大林的天才领导下，把军事艺术和我们祖国的军事上的荣誉，提高到空前的高峰。这样伟大的军队是人类历史上从所未有的军队，它击溃并且推翻了法西斯德国，在柏林上空升起了胜利的旗帜，尔后又毅然地打垮了日本帝国主义。
    连我们的祖先也和我们共同享有了这次胜利的光荣。
    在战争期间，苏沃洛夫的典型鼓舞了我们人民为了战胜敌人，进行了英勇和自我牺牲的斗争。斯大林同志在一九四一年十一月七日的演说里，对于我们伟大的先烈，谈到了苏沃洛夫的名字，他说这种典型将永远生存在我们之间，将永远生存在我们祖国新的荣耀和光荣的日子里。
    苏联以自己的政府来代表所有的人民，制定了三级勋章来永远地纪念着这位伟大的俄国统帅。
    以苏沃洛夫的名子教育着未来的指挥官们。
    一九四三年八月二十二日，苏联部长会议和联共（布）党中央委员会通过了直接恢复遭受德军占领过的地区经济办法，在这个决议里规定了：
    为了建立、训练和教育红军战士的子女，卫国战争游击队员的子女以及在德国侵略时死难的苏维埃党政工作人员、工人及集体农民的子女，要创立九个旧制中级苏沃洛夫军事学校，每校收五百人，总计四千五百人，训练期限七年，施以住校的严格集训。
    目前苏沃洛夫军事学校已经增加到十五所，苏沃洛夫军事学校的任务，是以一般的中等学业教育他们，同时准备使他们受军官的军事服役教育。
    以伟大俄国统帅的名子作为军事学校的名子，是具有很深刻的意义的，这表示着使他们要养成苏沃洛夫精神，在这里准备着具有军事技巧的指挥官，训练着先进军事思想的人们。强调着红军崇拜苏沃洛夫的传统。
    诗人、作家、外交家、军事领袖，不可战胜的统帅，这就是苏沃洛夫的典型，他是俄国人民最显著的代表之一，已经逝世了一百五十年，他还能以自己的天才放出无限的光芒。
