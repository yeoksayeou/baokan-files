Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The first batch of agricultural construction materials ordered from the Soviet Union by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government arrived in China in late April. After receiving these materials, the Ministry of Agriculture has distributed them to various regions for use according to plan.

This batch of agricultural construction materials includes agricultural machinery, breeding livestock, and pasture seeds. The agricultural machinery that has arrived includes 114 tractors, 74 combine harvesters, 272 twenty-four-row and sixteen-row seeders, 70 precision seeders, 50 seeder cultivators, as well as mowers, hay rakes, manure spreaders, seed selectors, threshers, disc harrows, tine harrows, plowshares, potato planters, potato harvesters, engineering vehicles, oil tankers, and repair tools and parts for these machines. The Ministry of Agriculture has distributed this batch of agricultural machinery to state-owned farms in North China, East China, Northeast China, and other regions for use during the spring plowing season. The Ministry of Agriculture's Mechanized Farming School also advanced the training of a batch of technicians to operate these machines. These trained technicians are currently interning at various wheat farms, preparing to operate the new machinery and participate in the summer harvest.

The high-quality breeding livestock that arrived this time include 250 sheep, 50 pigs, and 1,125 horses. The horse breeds include Ardennes, Vladimir Heavy Draft, Kabardin, Akhal-Teke, Thoroughbred, Guczuł, Karabair, Don, and eight other breeds. Among them, the Ardennes horses have extremely strong draft power, each capable of pulling weights of up to three to four tons. The Ministry of Agriculture has distributed this batch of breeding livestock to livestock farms in Northeast China, Chahar, Shanxi, and Suiyuan for mating and breeding, in order to supplement the shortage of draft animals and improve the quality of draft animals. In addition, 90 sets of artificial insemination equipment have also been distributed by the Ministry of Agriculture to livestock farms in Northeast China for trial use.

130,000 kilograms of pasture seeds have arrived, and the Ministry of Agriculture has also distributed them to Chahar, Suiyuan, and other regions for sowing. This type of pasture is the best green manure crop, and if rotated with crops such as cotton and grains, it can increase the yield of cotton and grains several times.

    向苏联订购农业建设物资
    第一批已运到并分配各地
    【新华社二十九日讯】中央人民政府农业部前向苏联订购的第一批农业建设物资，已在四月底大部运到我国。农业部在收到这批物资后，已按照计划分配给各地应用。
    这批农业建设物资包括农业机械、种畜、牧草种子等类。农业机械已运到的有拖拉机一百一十四部、联合收割机七十四部、二十四行和十六行播种机二百七十二部、点播机七十部、播种结合器五十部，以及割草机、搂草机、撒粪机、选种机、打谷机、圆盘耙、丁齿耙、犁尖、土豆播种机、土豆收割机、工程车、运油车等，另外还有这些机械的修理工具和零件。这批农业机械已由农业部在春耕期间分发给华北、华东、东北等地各国营农场应用。农业部机械耕作学校并提前调训了一批技术人员去驾驶这些机械。这批调训的技术人员现正在各麦作农场实习，准备驾驶新机械参加夏收。
    这次运到的优良种畜，计有羊二百五十只，猪五十头，马一千一百二十五匹。马的种类有阿尔登、弗拉基米尔、卡卡金、阿哈、纯血种、古粗、喀拉巴依、顿河等八种。其中阿尔登种的马、挽力极强，每匹竟能牵引重量达三吨至四吨。这批种畜已由农业部分发给东北、察哈尔、山西、绥远等畜牧场进行交配繁殖，以补充耕畜的不足和提高役畜的质量。此外，另有人工授精器械九十套，也已由农业部分发给东北各畜牧场试用。
    牧草种子运到的有十三万公斤，农业部也已分配给察哈尔、绥远等地播种。此种牧草为最好的绿肥作物，如与棉花、谷类等作物轮种，可使棉花、谷类的产量增加数倍。
