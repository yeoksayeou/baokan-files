Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th: *Pravda* recently published previously unpublished documents by Lenin. The documents are a series of Lenin's answers to questions posed by reporters from the American *New York Evening Journal* and the British *Daily Express*. This was in February 1920, after Kolchak and Denikin were defeated.

Lenin answered questions about the international situation and the foreign policy of the Soviet state. Lenin, starting from the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the Soviet state and capitalist countries, emphasized the Soviet Union's unwavering efforts for peace.

The published documents are of extraordinary significance for exposing the imperialists, especially the American imperialists, as warmongers and enemies of peace. Lenin's answers addressed the tasks of peaceful construction, including a thorough formula for the significance of the electrification of the Soviet Union in establishing communism.
