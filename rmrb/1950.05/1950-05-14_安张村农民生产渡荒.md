　　Anzhang Village Farmers Engage in Production to Overcome Famine

　　Anzhang Village, Sanyizhai Township, Chengguan District, Lanfeng County, Henan Province, has a total of 99 households, 412 people, and 1,120 mu of land. Last year, during the summer and autumn seasons, the village suffered from both floods and droughts, causing significant damage to crops. The average yield was only 35 jin per mu, and each person could only obtain an average of 95 jin of grain. By the beginning of December, most households had run out of food.

　　In order to organize the villagers to engage in production for self-salvation, the Chengguan District People's Government sent cadres to the village to assist the village head, Yang Wenbin, in convening experienced farmers with sideline production expertise for discussions on how to overcome the famine. Initially, most of the disaster-stricken people had the simple idea of relying solely on government relief. Everyone felt helpless and saw escape as the only option. Village head Yang Wenbin patiently cited many facts to illustrate that fleeing was not a solution. After repeated explanations and discussions, everyone began to realize that as long as they organized themselves and started production, the famine could be overcome. One farmer said, "As the saying goes, 'A diligent person will not starve in a year of famine, and a lazy person will starve in a year of plenty.' As long as everyone works together, no one will starve to death." Subsequently, based on the village's situation, they identified methods for self-salvation through salt transportation, oil pressing, salt boiling, weaving, and grass cutting. Farmers and cadres in the village with experience and skills in these various productions were selected as leaders, and all the villagers were organized according to their skills, expertise, and physical conditions to engage in various sideline productions.

　　After the government loaned 1,500 jin of grain to solve the shortage of salt transport carts, 47 people participated in salt transportation. Under the leadership of Sun Huyun, vice chairman of the farmers' association with salt transport experience, and activist Zhang Yucheng, they divided into five groups, traveling back and forth to Taikang, Xinyang, and other places to transport salt, making a round trip about every half month. Each cart could earn about 120 jin of grain.

　　The oil pressing group organized by ten households, led by farmer Zhang Majia, could not start production because they lacked capital. Jia Dianrong, chairman of the farmers' association, went to Lanfeng city and signed a "supply capital and repay with oil" contract with an oil mill, and obtained a loan of 1,700 jin of peanuts from the People's Government. Thus, the oil pressing group began production.

　　More than 20 people participated in transporting stone for river management, pushing a total of 6,000 jin of stone per day, earning 180 jin of grain in wages.

　　Older farmers in the village who could not go out to produce participated in the salt boiling group. Under the leadership of veteran salt worker Wang San, they opened six salt ponds to boil salt, producing 230 jin of salt per day in sunny weather.

　　The village's 54 women, led by the director of the women's association, also participated in spinning and weaving production. Thanks to the government loaning 30 jin of cotton, and farmers borrowing one spinning wheel from each other, each person received one jin of cotton as capital. Each spinning wheel could spin one jin of yarn every four days, which could be exchanged for eight jin of grain.

　　In addition, the village People's Government, in addition to organizing those with some labor ability among the 23 households of widowers, widows, orphans, and the childless to participate in work such as gathering firewood, also provided possible care to those who could not be mobilized at all through mutual assistance and mutual relief methods, so that they could live like other families.

　　After the farmers in the village obtained land in the recent land reform, their enthusiasm for production has been further increased. While continuing to adhere to sideline production, they have also launched mutual assistance in spring plowing. The 46 people who remained in the village to engage in oil pressing, salt boiling, and stone transportation, in addition to taking time to plow their own land and hoe wheat, also plowed and cultivated for salt transport households who went out to transport salt, using a reasonable work calculation method, and will repay the work or provide other remuneration in the future. The village farmers cultivated the land of widowers, widows, orphans, and the childless who had no labor force by means of substitute cultivation. Currently, all the spring land that should be cultivated in the village has been plowed and harrowed, and sowing has begun in some areas.

### 安张村农民生产渡荒

　　安张村农民生产渡荒
    河南省兰封县城关区三义寨乡安张村，共九十九户，四百一十二人，地一千一百二十亩。去年夏秋两季，该村水旱交加，禾苗受了很大损害，平均每亩仅收三十五斤，每人平均只能得到九十五斤粮食。到十二月初，大部家户已经断炊。
    城关区人民政府为着组织该村农民进行生产自救，曾专门派干部到该村协同村长杨文斌召集富有副业生产经验的农民进行座谈，讨论如何渡过灾荒。开头，一般灾民存在着单纯依赖政府救济的思想。大家都认为无法可想，只有逃荒一条路。杨文斌村长耐心地举出很多事实，说明逃荒不是办法；经过反复的解说和讨论后，大家都开始认识到，只要大家组织起来动手生产，灾荒是可以战胜的。一个农民说：“俗话说：荒年饿不死勤劳人，丰年饿死懒大汉；只要大家一齐干，一定不会饿死人。”接着，大家即根据本村情况，找出了运盐、榨油、熬盐、纺织、割草等生产自救的办法，并以村中对上述各种生产有经验有办法的农民和干部作为领导者，把全村所有农民按照技能特长和体力条件分别组织进行各种副业生产。
    在政府贷粮一千五百斤解决了缺少运盐小车的困难之后，参加运盐的人即有四十七人。他们在有运盐经验的农会副主席孙胡运和积极分子张玉成等的领导下，分成五个小组，往来于太康、信阳等处运盐，半月左右往返一次，每辆车能赚粮一百二十斤左右。
    以农民张马家为首的十户农民所组织的榨油组因为没有本钱，不能进行生产。农会主席贾殿荣即跑到兰封城里和一家油坊订立了“供本还油”的合同，并取得人民政府借贷的花生米一千七百斤，这样，榨油组即开始了生产。
    参加运石料治河的有二十多人，每天共可推石六千斤，得工资粮一百八十斤。
    村中年纪较大不能出外生产的农民都参加了熬盐组，在老盐工王三的领导之下，开了六个盐池熬盐，天晴时每天可产盐二百三十斤。
    该村的五十四名妇女，也在妇女会主任带领之下参加了纺纱和织布生产。由于政府贷花三十斤，农民间又互借了一部，每个人得到花本一斤。每辆纺车每四天能纺一斤纱，可换粮八斤。
    此外，该村人民政府对廿三户鳏、寡、孤、独等无劳动力的人家，除组织他们中一部分稍有劳动能力的人参加拾柴等工作外，对根本不能发动的人均以互助互济的办法给以可能的照顾，使他们也和其他人家一样能够生活下去。
    该村农民在最近土地改革中分得土地后，生产情绪更加高涨，一面继续坚持副业生产外，一面展开互助春耕。留在村中进行榨油、熬盐、运石头的四十六人，除抽空给自己犁地锄麦外，并以合理计工，将来还工或还给其他报酬的办法为外出运盐户进行耕种。鳏、寡、孤、独等无劳动力者的土地，该村农民均以代耕办法为之耕种。现全村应耕春地已犁、耙完毕，部分地区已开始播种。
