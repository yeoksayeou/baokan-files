Communist Party Member Shen Xianrong and Her Family
Anyang Prefectural Women's Federation

Communist Party member Shen Xianrong is the chairwoman of the Women's Congress in Huayuanzhuang, Anyang County, Pingyuan Province. She is very active in her work and has participated in the second All-Circles Representative Conference in the county. Her family used to be a large tenant farmer with twenty-two people, including five male laborers and six female laborers. Before the land reform, they only owned eight mu of land and rented fifty-seven mu. During the land reform, they were allocated forty-one mu, and they still rented sixteen mu. The affairs of the family were managed by the eldest brother, He Wenrui. Xianrong, as the second daughter-in-law, did not manage the household. After the land reform, Xianrong realized the glory of labor and that women were indispensable for achieving prosperity through production. At the same time, women could only improve their social and family status by participating in labor. Therefore, she not only actively participated in labor herself but also often persuaded her sisters-in-law to work with her. Before hoeing the wheat this year, the district called for the construction of a highway, and she actively responded by mobilizing women to participate. She first mobilized her sisters-in-law to build the road. This influenced twenty-five women to participate in road construction, which was completed in one morning. This freed up male laborers to engage in sideline occupations, which won the support of the masses and also encouraged women's confidence in participating in labor.

After the third County All-Circles Representative Conference, the branch conveyed the spirit of the conference and discussed how to achieve production and construction in the village. Xianrong understood various production policies and recognized the importance of learning techniques. She returned home and held three family meetings in eight days. The first meeting was to explain the policies. She said, "This time the county held a meeting calling for prosperity through production. Those who can become rich through production will be rewarded. Those with money and grain can lend it out, and if they can't farm all their land, they can hire long-term workers and freely buy and sell land. This time, Niu Qingping, the representative from Beishanzhuang, competed with everyone at the meeting to see who was wealthier. I think our family has plenty of people, and if we work hard, we shouldn't be afraid of not getting rich." The family members said, "We didn't know the situation before, but now we understand. Let's work hard." After the meeting, Xianrong thought, "Everyone says let's work hard, but how can we do it well? We need to have a plan." Two days later, she held the second family meeting. She said, "Our village has never hoed wheat before. This year the government is calling for hoeing wheat, saying it can produce more flour. We can hoe it several times. We'll plow the flower fields again and harrow them twice, and then plant after the rain."

When it was almost time to hoe the wheat for the second time, Huo Feng'e, the chairwoman of the Women's Congress in Xiaozhuang, a neighboring village, sent Xianrong a challenge letter, proposing to finish hoeing the second crop of wheat in three days. Xianrong immediately asked someone to write a reply accepting the challenge, guaranteeing to mobilize the women to finish hoeing in three days.

First, after discussion by the branch and the representative conference, it was decided to mobilize both men and women to go to the fields, with men plowing and women hoeing wheat. Because there was no habit of hoeing wheat in the past, very few women carried large hoes to the fields (small hoes were used for hoeing flowers, and grains were pulled by hand). Therefore, some young women were shy and unwilling to go, saying they didn't know how to hoe. Xianrong explained and mobilized everywhere, explaining the benefits of hoeing more wheat. After the mobilization, she herself first carried a large hoe with four women from her family and walked through the streets to the fields. She also mobilized a woman named Zhang to lead three women to the fields. The women saw that they were all going, and said: Let's go too, and compete with the Xiaozhuang family. In this way, sixty women went. They freely formed fifteen groups and finished hoeing the second crop of wheat in three days.

Then, Xianrong held the third family meeting, where she raised the question of what to do if the grain ran out before May, and guided everyone to calculate the family accounts and how to save through production. After accounting, it was decided that the men would engage in transportation and stone masonry to earn rice in addition to plowing and carrying manure. The women went to the fields, and the housework was also planned and divided: three of the six women went to the fields to work, one had given birth and was not yet a month old, and two stayed at home to cook, do chores, and take care of the children.

In this way, the whole family supported Xianrong's method. Her eldest brother said to Xianrong, "You understand the policies and know how to plan. You should manage our family." Xianrong said, "No matter who manages it, everyone should discuss production and life. You should still manage it." Everyone agreed that Xianrong should manage the family, so they elected Xianrong as the head of the household.

On April 13, the village discussed the issue of planting cotton. Cotton seeds were distributed, and a call was made to soak the seeds in warm water and organize mutual aid to overcome labor and animal power difficulties. On April 14, it rained, and Xianrong held another family meeting to discuss how to plant cotton. Xianrong proposed that everyone should strive to be a model in planting cotton this time. At this time, the third daughter-in-law said that she did not want to stay at home to take care of the children and wanted to go to the fields to work and strive to be a model. Xianrong then said, "As long as you take good care of the children at home, don't let them get smallpox or scabs, and don't have any problems, that's your contribution and you can be a model."

The whole family divided the work. After the cotton seeds were soaked in warm water, they were mixed with wood ash, and thirty mu of cotton fields were planted in two days.

Under the active leadership of five women representatives, especially Shen Xianrong, ninety women in the village participated in cotton planting. All the full and half female laborers went to the fields (one hundred and ten men participated), and five hundred mu of cotton fields were planted in two days.

On April 20, Xianrong's family held the fifth family meeting to summarize the production of this period and evaluate the models. Because Xianrong's family was close to the village government, some people went to listen to her family's meetings every time. This time, hearing that there was to be a summary and evaluation, male and female representatives and people from her village came to visit. In addition to the villagers, the chairwoman of the Women's Congress of Xiaotun Village, a base point, also came to visit. The whole family discussed democratically and selected one male model and two female models (one who went to the fields and one who did chores and took care of the children at home). On the 22nd, straw hats, needles, thread, towels, and hairnets were given as prizes. Then, the next stage of production was discussed, and a plan was drawn up.

The meeting ended, and the people who participated clapped their hands and said, "It's really good." When they went out, they said, "Our village has produced a female champion."

This family has now become a model for unity, production, and prosperity in this village and neighboring villages. The vice-chairwoman of the Women's Congress in this village also discussed and made production plans with her whole family. The family of the chairman of the People's Representative Conference, who used to quarrel frequently, now harmoniously discuss how to produce and prosper. In addition, four households in Xiaozhuang and two households in Xiaotun are now learning from the unity, harmony, and active production of Shen Xianrong's family.

　　共产党员申先荣和她的家庭
    安阳专区妇联
    共产党员申先荣，是平原安阳县花园庄的妇代会主席，工作很积极，曾参加本县第二届各界代表会。她的家庭原是个大佃户，有二十二口人，五个男劳力六个女劳力。土地改革以前自己只有八亩地，租种了五十七亩。土地改革时分回四十一亩，还有租地十六亩。家里事由老大何文瑞掌管，先荣是老二媳妇，不当家。经过了土地改革，先荣认识了劳动光荣，也知道了生产致富离了妇女也不行；同时妇女也只有参加劳动，才能提高自己的社会地位和家庭地位。因此，她不但自己积极地参加劳动，还经常劝说妯娌们和她一道干。今年锄麦前，区上号召修汽车路，她积极响应要动员妇女参加。她首先动员了自己的妯娌们去修路。这样就影响了二十五个妇女都参加了修路，一个早上便修完了。省下男劳力搞副业，得到了群众的拥护，也鼓舞了妇女参加劳动的信心。
    第三次县各界代表会以后，支部传达县代会的精神，并讨论本村如何实现生产建设的办法后，先荣了解了各种生产政策，认识了学习技术的重要，回到家里八天中召开了三次家庭会。第一次会议是解释政策。她说：“这次县里开会，叫生产发家哩，谁能生产致富还受奖励，有钱有粮的可以放账，地种不过来也能觅长工，也能自由买卖地。这回北山庄代表牛庆平在会上和大家比富，我想咱家有的是人，好好劳动不怕发不了家。”家人说：“从前咱不摸底，现在知道啦，好好干吧。”会后先荣就想：“大家说干吧，怎样能干好？总得打个套。”过了两天，她又召开了第二次家庭会。她说：“从前咱村没有锄过麦，今年政府号召锄麦，说能多出面，咱可多锄它几遍。三十亩麦地光俺妯娌们就能锄完，花地再犁一遍耙两遍，下了雨就种。”
    快要锄二遍麦子时，邻村小庄妇代会主席霍凤娥，给先荣来了挑战书，提出二遍麦子三天锄完。先荣马上托人写了个回信应战，保证发动妇女三天锄完。
    首先经过支部和代表会讨论，分片酝酿发动男女下地，男人犁地，妇女锄麦子。因为过去没有锄麦习惯，妇女们扛大锄下地的很少（锄花用小锄、谷是用手拔）。所以有些青年妇女害羞不愿去，说不会锄。先荣到处解释动员，说明多锄麦子的好处。动员后，她自己先和自己家里的四个妇女扛上大锄从街上走过下地去。并又动员一个姓张的带领三个妇女一块下了地。妇女们见她们都去了，就说：咱们也去吧，和小庄家赛一赛。这样一来，就去了六十个妇女。她们又自由碰了十五个组，三天锄完二遍麦。
    接着先荣又召开了第三次家庭会议，她提出粮食吃不到五月怎办，引导大家算家庭账，如何生产节约。经过算账，决定男人除犁地担粪外，赶大车运输，当石匠赚米。妇女下地，把家里活也作了计划分了工，六个妇女三个下地劳动，一个生孩子未满月，两个在家做饭做杂活看孩子。
    这样一来，全家都拥护先荣的办法好。她大哥对先荣说：“你又懂政策又会打算，咱家还是你当家吧。”先荣说：“不管谁当吧，生产过日子都要大家商量，还是你当吧。”大家都同意先荣当，就选先荣当了家。
    四月十三日全村讨论了棉花下种问题，当下发出棉籽，号召温汤浸种，组织互助，克服劳畜力困难。十四日下了雨，先荣又召开了家庭会议，讨论怎样种棉花。先荣提出，这次种棉大家要争取当模范。这时老三媳妇提出，不愿在家看小孩，要去地里劳动争模范。先荣便说：“你只要在家把孩子看好，不要沾上天花糠疮，不出啥毛病，这就是你的功劳，也能当模范。”
    全家进行了分工，棉种温汤浸过后，又用草木灰拌了，三十亩棉田两天种完了。
    在五个妇女代表特别是申先荣的积极带头下，全村有九十个妇女参加了种棉，所有全半女劳力都下了地（男人参加的有一百一十个），五百亩棉田两天种完了。
    四月二十日，先荣家又开第五次家庭会议，总结这一段的生产，评选模范。因为先荣家离村政府近，她家每次开会都有些群众去听。这次听说要总结评选，她村男女代表和群众都去参观，除了本村的还有本基点小屯村的妇代会主席也到来参观。全家民主讨论，选出男模范一个，女模范二个（下地的一个，在家里做杂活领孩子的一个），二十二日发了些草帽、针线、手巾、发网作奖品。接着讨论了下段生产，并订出了计划。
    会议结束了，参加会的群众都拍手说“真好”，出门就说：“咱村可出了女状元了。”
    这个家庭，现在已经成为本村和邻村团结生产发家的榜样。本村妇代会副主席也和全家商量订生产计划。人民代表会议主席家过去经常闹气，现在也和睦地商量如何生产发家了。此外小庄有四户，小屯有二户，现在也学习申先荣家庭的团结和睦积极生产了。
