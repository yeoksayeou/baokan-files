[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Refunds for Mistakenly Paid Taxes on Old Stock of Taxable Goods

　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] According to instructions from the General Taxation Bureau of the People's Government of Beijing Municipality Tax Bureau: Regardless of whether they are publicly or privately owned factory stocks of raw materials and equipment, and privately owned stocks for personal use (which must be strictly distinguished from those hoarding for speculation), all goods that were already stored or purchased before the promulgation of the "Provisional Regulations on New Commodity Tax" on February 1st of this year, and are not sold on the market, should be exempt from supplementary tax. The various tax sub-bureaus have already been instructed to refund all mistakenly collected taxes within the above scope during the previous supplementary tax registration work for old stock taxable goods. The refund methods are as follows: (1) For a small number of private individuals and organizations who have already paid tax on articles for personal use, a refund will be immediately issued in the form of cash equivalent to the original amount paid; (2) For raw materials and equipment stored by factories, if they can be deducted from the newly paid commodity tax or business tax in the short term (one or two months), the refund may be temporarily withheld. If they cannot be deducted from the newly paid commodity tax or business tax in the short term, a cash refund will still be issued; (3) The refund work will be carried out by the original tax sub-bureaus that collected the payments (if the supplementary tax was paid to the Municipal Tax Bureau, it will be handled by the Municipal Tax Bureau). The implementation step is to audit and refund one household at a time, to be completed before the end of May.
