　　Ministry of Heavy Industry Directs Subordinates
    Vigorously Conduct Safety Education
    Establish Safety Organizations and Inspection Reporting Systems
    [Xinhua News Agency, 27th] The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government recently instructed its subordinate units to earnestly launch safety education. Since the Ministry organized an emergency major inspection of industrial and mining enterprises in North China last year, the safety work of its affiliated enterprises and mines has been partially improved; however, according to statistics from January to March of this year, there were still as many as sixty various accidents reported to the Ministry. To this end, the Ministry of Heavy Industry in its instructions first requires leading cadres at all levels to recognize the importance of safety work ideologically, extensively carry out education on safety technical knowledge, so that operators fully understand the performance of machinery and equipment and safety knowledge in operation; and further formulate safety rules and disciplines, and universally strictly implement them.
    In order to ensure the implementation and thorough implementation of safety education work, the instructions require the heads of each unit to personally be responsible for establishing fixed safety organizations at all levels, adding specialized safety engineering personnel, combining with the broad masses of workers and staff, forming a safety net, and systematically carrying out this work; and establishing a level-by-level inspection and reporting system.
    The instructions stipulate that all subordinate units must make summaries by the end of July according to their level, and put forward methods and opinions for continuing to implement safety education in the future.

　　重工业部指示所属
    大力进行安全教育
    建立安全组织及检查汇报制度
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府重工业部最近指示所属各单位认真展开安全教育。该部自去年组织对华北地区工矿企业的紧急大检查后，所属企业单位及厂矿的安全工作已有部分改进；但据今年一月至三月的统计，呈报该部的各种事故仍有六十起之多。为此，重工业部在指示中首先要求各级领导干部应从思想上认识安全工作的重要性，广泛开展安全技术知识的教育，使操作人员充分了解机器设备的性能与操作上的安全知识；并进而制订安全的规则和纪律，普遍严格执行。
    为保证安全教育工作的实施和贯彻，指示要求各单位首长必须亲自负责建立各级固定的安全组织，添设专门安全工程人员，结合广大职工，组成安全网，有系统地进行这一工作；并建立逐级的检查和汇报制度。
    指示规定所属各单位须于七月底前按级做出总结，提出今后继续贯彻安全教育的方法和意见。
