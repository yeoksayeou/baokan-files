Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 15th: The "Pravda" published an article by Varga on the 10th, entitled "The Economies of Capitalist Countries Under Attack by US Monopoly Capital".

Varga wrote: The apologists for US monopoly capital are spreading a ridiculous argument around the world, insisting that the US is saving the economies of other capitalist countries. In fact, however, US monopoly capital is the main factor responsible for the economic bankruptcy of other countries. They are trying to shift the burden of the ever-worsening general crisis of capitalism, and the new, growing economic crisis particularly evident in the US, onto other countries.

Varga pointed out: The excess of all kinds of capital is a characteristic of the American economy.

The closure of thousands of factories and manufacturing plants, and the fact that the enterprises that remain open are not operating at full capacity due to lack of demand, all prove the excess of production capital. At the end of 1949, the total value of goods accumulated by enterprises in wholesale and retail trade reached 60 billion US dollars, which is a manifestation of the excess of American commodity capital.

The new economic crisis is stubbornly growing. One of the ironclad proofs of this is the total of 18 million workers in the United States who are either completely or partially unemployed. Faced with excess capital, US monopoly capital, in its struggle to maintain high monopoly profits, is undermining the economies of all other capitalist countries.

Deliberately raising prices in the domestic market is one of the main sources of obtaining monopoly super-profits. And only by excluding the competition of relatively cheaper foreign goods in the domestic market can prices be maintained at such a high level. High tariffs serve precisely this purpose.

Varga further wrote: In the struggle to seize world hegemony, US monopoly capital desperately wants to ensure its access to the entire world market, ruthlessly suppressing its capitalist rivals. In order to maintain high prices in the domestic market, and to seize the world market, US monopoly capitalists use dumping to flood the world market with surplus American goods. Monopoly capitalists even sell goods to foreign countries at prices lower than their original costs, but directly compensate for this loss from the state budget, relying on taxpayers' money.

After World War II, US monopoly capitalists, on the one hand, resorted to dumping on a large scale to seize the world market, and on the other hand, tried to sell their surplus goods abroad at high prices. This goal was achieved by relying on the transportation of goods under the Marshall Plan and the supply of armaments to the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty, as well as Greece, Turkey, Iran, and other countries.

For US monopoly capitalists, subsidizing export trade with state funds is a win-win situation. On the one hand, it makes it easier for them to maintain monopolistic high prices in the domestic market, and on the other hand, it enables them to earn money abroad for surplus goods. At the same time, this measure inflicts a double loss on American workers. On the one hand, they have to buy consumer goods at high prices, and on the other hand, state subsidies for export trade further increase the tax burden on the working people.

Varga continued: In the first three years after the war (1946-1948), the value of US export trade was 38 billion US dollars, while in 1936-1938, it was 9 billion US dollars. However, in those post-war years, the US only imported goods worth 18 billion US dollars, which means that its export trade to the world market exceeded its import trade by 20 billion US dollars. This cannot but have a destructive impact on the economies of other capitalist countries. Varga pointed out: Because the United States is a major exporting country of both manufactured goods and grain, all other capitalist countries, especially those in Western Europe, have experienced a trade deficit in their economic relations with the United States after the war.

The United States undermines the economies of other capitalist countries not only through one-sided export trade, but also through forcibly prohibiting Western Europe from trading with the People's Democracies. According to statistics from the British weekly "The Economist": In 1938, Western Europe purchased 1.685 billion US dollars worth of grain from these countries, while in 1948, the grain purchased was only worth 307 million US dollars. The policy of splitting Germany implemented by US imperialism has also had an unfortunate impact on the economy of Western Europe.

The bankruptcy of the economies of Marshallized countries, their transformation into appendages of the US economy, and the sharp decline in the living standards of the working people – these are the consequences of the treacherous policies of the bourgeoisie in those countries, who have sold their national interests and national independence to US monopoly capitalists.

Varga wrote: The Americans stubbornly suggest that Western European countries should unite into a single economic zone, insisting that this is to save those countries' situation. However, the real purpose of this suggestion is to make Marshallized countries completely subject to US capital. The plan of US monopoly capitalists is not to help Western European countries, but to open the doors of those countries and their colonies to further flooding by American goods, and to subject those countries to economic and political enslavement. The policy pursued by the United States towards Marshallized countries has not only failed to relieve the economic crisis in the United States, but has deepened the economic crisis in the United States and accelerated the development of the economic crisis in Western Europe. Even some representatives of the bourgeoisie have had to openly admit that American policy is driving Western European countries towards bankruptcy.

While subjecting Marshallized countries to economic enslavement, US imperialism is also turning them into military bridgeheads for the new war that US imperialism is preparing, forcing these countries to use most of their budget funds for war preparations. All of this makes the situation in Marshallized countries worse, increases the tax burden, and further impoverishes the masses of the people.

Varga concluded: The people of all countries are increasingly aware that the so-called "economic assistance" provided by the United States, and its entire policy of trying to hastily put together aggressive blocs, is deliberately intended to plunder and enslave the people of all countries, destroy their national sovereignty, and launch a new war. An increasingly broad mass of working people has joined the ranks of active fighters in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the great Soviet Union – the indestructible fortress of socialism and the fortress of international peace and security.

　　在美国独占资本打击下的资本主义各国的经济
　　真理报发表瓦尔加专文
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：《真理报》十日刊载瓦尔加的专文，题为“在美国独占资本打击下的资本主义各国的经济”。
    瓦尔加写道：美国独占资本的辩护士们，向全世界散布一种荒唐的论调，硬说美国在拯救其他资本主义国家的经济。然而事实上，美国独占资本乃是应对其他国家经济破产负责的主要因素。他们竭力把日益严重的资本主义的总危机，以及在美国表现得特别明显的新的日益成长的经济危机的负担，转嫁到其他各国身上。
    瓦尔加指出：所有各种资本的过剩，乃是美国经济所表现的特征。
    成千的工厂和制造厂关闭了，依然在开工的企业，由于需求的缺乏，也没有全部开工，这都证明了生产资本的过剩。到一九四九年年底，各企业在批发和零售交易方面，堆积的商品总值达六百亿美元，这便是美国商品资本过剩的表现。
    新的经济危机很顽强地日益增长着。美国存在着完全失业和部分失业的工人，共计一千八百万人，便是这一方面的铁证之一。面临资本过剩的美国独占资本，在其为保持高额独占利润而进行的斗争中，破坏着其他一切资本主义国家的经济。
    在国内市场上故意抬高物价，乃是取得独占的超额利润的主要来源之一。而唯有凭借排斥比较低廉的外国货在国内的竞争，才可能使物价保持在这么高的水平上。高额的关税正是为了这个目的而服务的。
    瓦尔加进一步写道：在为夺取世界霸权的斗争中，美国独占资本拚命要确保自己获得整个世界市场，残忍无情地压制它的资本主义的敌手。为了在国内市场上保持住高物价，为了攫夺世界市场，美国独占资本家们就用倾销的手段，使世界市场上泛滥着美国的剩余商品。独占资本家甚至以低于原来成本的价钱，向外国抛售商品，但又直接从国家预算中，靠人民纳税，来弥补这方面的损失。
    第二次世界大战后，美国独占资本家们，一方面大规模地诉诸倾销的手段，以攫取世界市场，另一方面又竭力用高价向国外兜售他们的剩余商品。依靠根据马歇尔计划运销商品并以军备供应北大西洋公约签字国、以及希腊、土耳其、伊朗等国的办法，来达成这种目的。
    由国家出钱贴补出口贸易，对美国独占资本家来说，是一举两得的事情。一方面使他们更容易在国内市场上保持住垄断的高物价，另一方面又使他们能够为剩余商品，在国外赚笔钱。与此同时，这种措施却使美国工人受到两重损失。一方面他们要以高价购买消费品，另一方面因为由国家出钱贴补出口贸易，就更加重了劳动人民的捐税负担。
    瓦尔加继续说：在战后最初三年间（一九四六年——一九四八年），美国出口贸易额是三百八十亿美元，而一九三六年——一九三八年，是九十亿美元。可是，在战后那几年中，美国仅输入了值一百八十亿美元的货物，就是说，它对世界市场的出口贸易，比它的进口贸易超过了二百亿美元。这对于其他资本主义国家的经济，不能不引起破坏性的影响。瓦尔加指出：因为美国既是制造品和粮食的一个最大的输出国家，所有其他一切资本主义国家，尤其是西欧那些国家，战后在对美国的经济关系上，都有了入超的现象。
    美国破坏其他资本主义国家的经济，不仅凭借片面的出口贸易，而且更凭借强行禁止西欧与人民民主国家贸易。据英国《经济学者》周刊的统计资料：一九三八年，西欧曾向这些国家购进价值十六亿八千五百万美元的粮食，而一九四八年购进的粮食仅值三亿七百万美元了。美帝国主义所实行的分裂德国的政策，对西欧的经济也造成了不幸的影响。
    马歇尔化国家经济的破产、沦为美国经济的附庸，劳动人民生活标准的急剧降低——这些便是那些国家的资产阶级进行奸诈叛逆政策所引起的后果，他们已把他们的国家利益和国家独立都出卖给美国独占资本家了。
    瓦尔加写道：美国人顽固地建议，西欧各国应联合起来成为一个单一的经济区域，硬说这是为了解救那些国家的处境。然而，这种建议的实际目的，原来是要使马歇尔化国家完全受美国资本支配。美国独占资本家们的计划，并不是以帮助西欧国家为任务，而是要使那些国家及其殖民地门户洞开，以便更进一步为美国货所充斥，使那些国家受经济的和政治的奴役。美国对马歇尔化国家所推行的政策，不仅未能使美国解除经济危机，反而更加深了美国的经济危机，并且更加速了西欧经济危机的发展。就连某些资产阶级代表人物，也不得不公开承认：美国的政策使西欧各国趋于破产。
    美帝国主义一方面使马歇尔化国家受经济上的奴役，另一方面更把它们变成了美国帝国主义正在准备的新战争的军事桥头堡垒，强迫这些国家使用大部分的预算经费来作战争的准备。所有这一切，使马歇尔化国家处境更加恶劣，增加捐税负担，使人民大众更加贫穷化。
    瓦尔加在结语中称：世界各国人民越来越明白，美国所给予的所谓“经济援助”，以及它企图仓卒凑成侵略集团的整个政策，是蓄意要劫掠、奴役各国人民，摧毁它们的国家主权，而发动新战争。越来越广大的劳动人民群众，加入了以伟大苏联——不可摧毁的社会主义堡垒和国际和平与安全的堡垒——为首的、和平民主与社会主义阵营内积极的战士们的队伍了。
