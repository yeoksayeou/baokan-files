　　Peking University Liberal Arts Research Institute Holds Exhibition of Historical Materials on Li Zicheng's Uprising
    [Our Newspaper] The Liberal Arts Research Institute of Peking University will hold a special exhibition of portraits of the oppressed people of the Han Dynasty and historical materials on peasant uprisings such as that of Li Zicheng from May 4th to May 7th at the institute in Cuihua Hutong, Dongcheng, Beijing.
    Portraits of the oppressed people of the Han Dynasty are displayed in three categories, based on Han stone carvings and pottery figurines. The first category is the laboring people engaged in production. The second category: laboring people who have become detached from production and are used by the ruling class. The third category: revolutionary people who oppose the ruling class.
    There are sixty pieces of historical material on the people's uprising of Li Zicheng and others. One part concerns the peasant troops who were called "bandits." Where did these peasant uprising troops come from? Who forced them to go to Liangshan? There are some descriptions of the dress and flags of their troops, as well as the progress of their military operations. Another part concerns the ruling class. In addition, there is also an attached map of Li Zicheng's military progress and a chronology of major events.
