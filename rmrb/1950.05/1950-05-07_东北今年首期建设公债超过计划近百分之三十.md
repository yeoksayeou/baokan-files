Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 5th: The issuance of the Northeast 1950 first phase production and construction unit-linked bonds has been successfully completed. The actual sales of the bonds reached 21,213,000 units, which, together with the 800,000 units paid by farmers in grain, totals nearly 30 percent more than the original plan of 17,000,000 units. This great achievement has played a considerable role in balancing the income and expenditure of the Northeast's finances in the first quarter of this year and ensuring the payment of funds needed for industrial construction. In previous years, March was a month when market prices were prone to fluctuations. This year, thanks to the issuance of bonds, currency was withdrawn in a timely manner, tightening market capital, and thus stabilizing prices. The allocation of these bonds was very reasonable, with industrialists and businessmen accounting for 65.2 percent, urban residents accounting for 12.6 percent, employees of institutions, enterprises, and schools accounting for 9.1 percent, farmers accounting for 7.1 percent, peddlers accounting for 4.9 percent, and the remainder being other subscribers. Although workers and public employees are not wealthy, they still worked hard to take the lead in subscribing. For example, the subscription amount of employees in the Lushun-Dalian area exceeded the original task by 482 percent, making the total subscription amount in the entire area more than double the task.

　　东北今年首期建设公债超过计划近百分之三十
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北一九五○年第一期生产建设折实公债的发行工作已胜利完成。公债实销额为二千一百廿一万三千分，连同农民以粮谷实缴的八十万分，总计超过原计划一千七百万分的百分之三十弱。这一巨大成绩对于平衡今年首季东北财政的收支和保证工业建设所需资金的支付起了相当大的作用。往年三月份是市场物价容易波动的月份，今年由于公债的发行，及时回笼货币，紧缩市场游资，因而稳定了物价。此次公债分配甚为合理，计工商业者占百分之六十五点二，市民占百分之十二点六，机关、企业、学校的职工占百分之九点一，农民占百分之七点一，行商摊贩占百分之四点九，余为其他认购者。工人及公教人员生产虽并不富裕，但仍努力带头认购，如旅大地区职工认购额超过了原定任务百分之四百八十二，使全区认购额超过任务一倍。
