Suggestions for Carrying Out Cholera and Typhoid Prevention
    Hu An

    "Manufacture 40 million doses of mixed cholera and typhoid vaccine and carry out key preventive inoculations in major cities in the Yangtze River Basin." -- A line from the 1950 work plan of the Central Ministry of Health -- "Cholera" is an acute gastrointestinal infectious disease that spreads rapidly, is difficult to treat, and has a high mortality rate. In the old China of the past, it was a great threat to the lives of the masses, so much so that it was called the "tiger epidemic." "Typhoid fever" occurs frequently throughout China, whether in summer, autumn, or winter, in cities, villages, the south, or the north. Once summer and autumn arrive, with flies swarming, it is most likely to become epidemic. In order to prevent the spread of these two epidemics, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has decided to manufacture 40 million doses of cholera and typhoid vaccines this year, which will be distributed free of charge to governments at all levels in the Yangtze River Basin and major cities for widespread inoculation.

    The efficacy of "cholera" and "typhoid" vaccines in preventing cholera and typhoid has been proven to be very effective through many years of experimental research. If we also pay attention to food hygiene and prevent flies and eliminate maggots, we can prevent the spread of these epidemics.

    However, adding the vaccines manufactured by the health agencies under the Military Commission Health Department, and those manufactured by the public and private health agencies in the major administrative regions of Northeast, Northwest, East China, and Southwest, the estimated total will be more than 60 million doses. How to ensure that these are indeed inoculated into the bodies of 60 million soldiers, civilians, and working people, with each person receiving two or three injections, is not an easy task. In the past, the quantity manufactured was not so large, and even fewer were inoculated into the people. Among the medical supplies obtained by the People's Liberation Army in liberating various cities, large quantities of expired vaccines were often found. This is something that epidemic prevention personnel in health agencies at all levels should be very vigilant about.

    First of all, the heads of health institutions at all levels should urge the military and political leaders at all levels to attach importance to preventive inoculations, mobilize all departments to carry out extensive publicity and mobilization; cultural and educational departments, people's organizations, newspapers, magazines, and radio stations at all levels should also vigorously publicize, in this early summer season, the dangers of cholera and typhoid fever, as well as the routes of transmission, prevention methods, and the benefits of preventive inoculations; and health agencies should produce propaganda charts and leaflets to explain them widely. Secondly, health agencies should prepare to organize sufficient manpower and injection equipment to implement free injections. They should also divide the areas and assign the number of preventive inoculations to each epidemic prevention organization, requiring them to complete their tasks through persuasion—preventing coercive orders. In addition, private medical and health institutions, medical personnel, and teachers and students of medical and nursing schools at all levels should be mobilized to form temporary epidemic prevention organizations, issue them with injection equipment, and assign them areas and tasks to cooperate with relevant departments in carrying out publicity and injections. Certificates must be issued after all injections.

    Thirdly, military and political departments at all levels should organize and inspect from top to bottom whether all their personnel have been inoculated (those who are deemed medically unfit by a doctor may be exempted, and a certificate will also be issued). And the guard troops, customs, and transportation departments should have people at the city gates, checkpoints, stations, ticket offices, and transportation hubs to constantly advise and mobilize everyone to carry out preventive inoculations.

    If we can complete the inoculation of 60 million people, we can greatly reduce the possibility of these two epidemics spreading. This is an important task to protect the safety of the lives of the people throughout the country. I hope everyone will cooperate fully to complete this huge task.

　　开展预防霍乱伤寒的建议
    胡安
    制造霍乱伤寒混合疫苗四千万人份，在长江流域各大城市施行重点预防注射。——中央卫生部一九五○年工作计划的一条——“霍乱”是一种急性胃肠传染病，传播迅速，治疗困难，死亡率高。在过去旧的中国，对人民群众生命的威胁很大，以至于把它称为“虎疫”·“伤寒病”，在中国各地，不论在夏秋冬，城市乡村，南方北方，经常的发生，一旦夏秋来临，苍蝇群集，最有可能流行。中央人民政府卫生部为防止这两种病疫流行，决定本年度制造霍乱、伤寒疫苗四千万人份，免费的发到长江流域及各大城市的各级政府，以便进行广泛注射。
    “霍乱”，“伤寒”预防菌苗，对霍乱伤寒预防的效能，经过许多年来的实验研究，已经证明是很有效的。如果平日再注意饮食卫生，及防蝇灭蛆，就可防止这种疫病流行。
    但是，要把这四千万人份的菌苗，加上军委卫生部所属卫生机关所制造的，及东北、西北、华东、西南各大行政区公私卫生机关所制造的菌苗，估计总数当在六千万人份以上，如何的的确确注射到六千万军民、劳苦群众的身上，每人注射二或三次，这是一件不容易的事。过去的经验，制造的数量就没有这样多，而注射到人民身上的更少。人民解放军解放各城市所获的医药物资中，往往发现大批过期的疫苗，这是值得我们各级卫生机关防疫人员十分警惕的。
    首先，各级卫生机构负责人，应当推动各级军政首长，对防疫注射加以重视，发动所属各部门进行广泛的宣传动员；各级文化教育部门、人民团体、报纸、杂志、广播电台，在此夏初季节，也应大力宣传，使广大群众了解霍乱、伤寒的危险，以及传染的道路、防治的方法和预防注射的好处；而卫生机关更应制造宣传图表传单，广为解释说明。其次卫生机关应准备组织足够的人力和注射器材，实行免费注射。并划分地区，指定各防疫组织的预防注射的人数任务，要使他们通过宣传说服——防止强迫命令方式——来完成其任务。此外，应发动各私立医药卫生机关、医务人员，各级医药护产学校的在校师生，组成临时防疫机构，发给注射用的器械，指定地区、任务，使其配合有关部门，进行宣传注射。注射后必须一律发给证明。
    再次，各军政部门应自上而下的进行组织检查其所属人员是否全体注射（经医生同意认为体格不合者可以免除，亦发给证明）。而警卫部队、海关、交通部门应有人在城门、关卡、车站、票房、交通要道，经常进行劝告，动员大家进行防疫注射。
    如果能完成六千万人的注射，就可大大地减少这两种疫病流行的可能性，这是保障全国人民生命安全的一项重要工作，希望大家通力合作，完成这一巨大任务。
