　　Australia Withdraws Occupation Troops from Japan
    After Prior "Consultation" and Obtaining "Agreement" from US Imperialism
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 29th, dispatch from TASS, Sydney, May 27th]: Australian Prime Minister Menzies announced on the 26th that the Australian government has decided to withdraw its troops from the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. The Commonwealth Occupation Force originally consisted of troops from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and India, and currently has 2,374 Australians. Menzies said: This action was taken after consultation with and agreement from the US government. One reason for the withdrawal is that it will help implement the compulsory military service plan in Australia as soon as possible. It can be seen from Menzies' statement that the reason for withdrawing Australian troops from Japan is to step up war preparations in Australia. Menzies said: "The implementation of national training will severely increase the burden on the Australian army and requires long-term planning and resource reserves. The withdrawal will enable the Australian defense forces to be established." Menzies also said that the current actions of the Australian government will enable Australia to "make a greater contribution to common defense issues." Despite the fact that Menzies' statement contains many deliberately vague platitudes, it is not difficult to see that the United States, in its Pacific plan, is assigning Australian troops an important role.

　　澳撤退驻日占领军
    事先曾与美帝“商谈”并获“同意”
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社悉尼二十七日讯：澳大利亚总理孟席斯二十六日宣布，澳大利亚政府已决定从不列颠联邦驻日占领军中撤回其军队。联邦占领军原先是由英国、澳大利亚、新西兰和印度的部队组成的，现在共有二千三百七十四名澳大利亚人。孟席斯说：这一行动是与美国政府商谈并取得其同意之后才采取的。撤军的一个理由是：撤军将有助于在澳大利亚早日实施强迫兵役计划。从孟席斯的声明中可以看出：所以要从日本撤回澳大利亚的部队，乃是为了在澳大利亚加紧进行战争准备。孟席斯说：“全国性的训练的实行，将严重地加重澳大利亚部队的负担，需要长期的筹划与储备资源。撤军将使澳大利亚防御力量能够建立起来。”孟席斯又说，澳大利亚政府目前的行动，将使澳大利亚“对共同防御问题有更大贡献”。尽管孟席斯的声明包含了许多故意含糊的谰调，人们却不难看出：美国在其太平洋计划中，指派澳大利亚军队扮演重要脚色。
