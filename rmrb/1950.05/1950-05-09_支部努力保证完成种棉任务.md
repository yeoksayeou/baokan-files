Branch Strives to Ensure Completion of Cotton Planting Task
    Zhongsuo Village, Anci, Hebei, Party Members Take the Lead in Setting Plans

    Zhongsuo Village, Anci County, Hebei Province, has a total of 2,278 mu of land. Excluding pits, stubble fields, and autumn wheat fields, there are only 792 mu of open land. However, thanks to the strong leadership of the branch, it has basically completed the task of planting 1,000 mu of cotton assigned by the higher authorities. The village branch has seven Party members, with Branch Secretary Sun Baolin concurrently serving as village chief, and Deputy Branch Secretary Liu Baozhen (female) concurrently serving as deputy director of the Women's Federation. The branch has a very good working foundation, and the farmers have a long-standing habit of growing cotton. This spring, the branch initially decided to plant 600 mu of cotton based on the area of open land. However, at the district representative meeting on April 19th, it was assigned a task of 1,000 mu. Branch Secretary Sun Baolin and Deputy Branch Secretary Liu Baozhen happily accepted this arduous task. After returning to the village, they analyzed and studied the soil quality and the area of various crops in the village, and then convened a meeting of all Party members to convey the information. Comrade Liu Baozhen earnestly mobilized everyone to ensure 100% completion of the task. However, most Party members lacked confidence. At this time, Liu Baozhen reported her plan to everyone: "I have 14 mu of land, 5 mu of which are planted with autumn wheat, and I will plant cotton on all 9 mu of open land, and plant another 4 mu in the wheat ridges." And she mobilized everyone to lead the masses. In this way, all Party members proposed to plant cotton on all the land that could be planted with cotton (including tree rows and wheat fields). After unifying their thinking within the Party, they immediately convened an expanded meeting of various departments in the village. At that time, some cadres said, "Planting 1,000 mu, our village doesn't even have enough open land, we can't complete the task!" Liu Baozhen then said to everyone: "Our village is not behind in any work, and we have won award flags for two dike constructions, and we are all models. This time, we must strive to be a model in planting cotton. As long as our cadres actively work hard and take the lead as models, it will not be a problem to complete the task." Immediately afterwards, Party members and cadres reported their cotton planting plans to everyone. The cadres listened to the plans of the Party members, and their thinking was also straightened out. On the spot, Guo Chengzhao, director of the Farmers' Association (a non-Party member), immediately proposed: "I guarantee to plant cotton on all the land that can be planted with cotton." That evening, a mass meeting was also held, and Chen Yuting, an old farmer with 20 years of cotton planting experience, was invited to report on cotton planting methods. Lou Wancheng, an old farmer who made a fortune by planting cotton, was also invited to report on the facts of his cotton planting fortune. At the meeting, cadres and Party members reported their cotton planting plans to the masses. Subsequently, Sun Baolin and Liu Baozhen reported the policies of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and the price of eight to ten catties of millet per catty of cotton, calling on the masses to report their cotton planting plans. After discussion, households reported plans to plant a total of 896 mu (including Party members and cadres). In order to ensure that the plan was not in vain, cadres and Party members were assigned to check the number of cotton planting land and cotton seeds in each household. The branch convened another meeting of Party members to discuss how to complete the task of 1,000 mu of cotton fields. At the meeting, everyone believed that cotton could be planted on the back of the wheat fields in the east of the village, so it was decided that Party members should take the lead in planting first. After the meeting, it was discovered that activist Lou Wancheng also planned to interplant cotton in the wheat fields, so the branch seized this typical example and convened a mass meeting to introduce it. The branch once again called on the masses to make plans, and Party members once again reported their personal plans. After the meeting, 28 households made new plans, and the village as a whole could plant a total of 1,007 mu of cotton.

    After the plan was set, Liu Baozhen, in her capacity as deputy director of the Women's Federation, convened a village-wide women's congress to mobilize everyone to pick seeds (because the harvest was poor last year, the seeds were mixed). Liu Baozhen originally had a high prestige among women. Under her call, 152 women participated in the seed picking. In three days, 6,843 catties of cotton seeds were picked in the village, and they were fast and pure. The Langfang Cotton Production Guidance Zone and the County People's Government specially presented a model award flag.

    In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor, Liu Baozhen was determined to mobilize women. First of all, a decision was made at the branch meeting to temporarily suspend the women's literacy class. Taking the opportunity of the literacy class, Liu Baozhen mobilized model women to respond to the call of the higher authorities to plant cotton, participate in field labor, and become labor models in cotton planting. And she called on women to voluntarily form mutual aid groups. After the meeting, Liu Baozhen first formed a group (three women and one man), planting seven mu of cotton in half a day. Under her influence, most of the young and middle-aged women participated in the labor. Zhang Wanchun's (female) group planted nine mu of cotton in one day. Ding Changrong, a 17-year-old student in the women's literacy class, and her mother-in-law picked up stones from five mu of land (land on both sides of the railway) in three days. Her family planted a total of 21 mu of cotton. In this way, 89 women in the village formed 16 mutual aid groups with men, solving the difficulty of insufficient manpower. As of April 30, the village had planted 850 mu, and sowing was continuing.

    Guo Jiazhuang Branch Guarantees Full Seedling Emergence

    Guo Jiazhuang, District Six, Shulu County, Hebei Province, has a total of 4,636 mu of land (this year's wheat fields account for more than 800 mu), and most of it is dry land. The district initially assigned the village a cotton planting task of 850 mu, which was increased to 1,200 mu after the rain on April 15. This accounts for more than 25% of the village's total land area.

    In order to ensure the completion of the cotton planting task, the Guo Jiazhuang branch convened all Party members to study preparations before the rain. Party members first made their own cotton planting plans and began to prepare cotton seeds. Each household had 5,000 catties of cotton seeds in stock, and would go to Xinji to buy more if needed. In order to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage in cotton fields, the masses were organized to buy 1,000 catties of soybean cake, and general cotton fields could be fertilized with one or two carts.

    Before the rain stopped on April 15, the branch convened an emergency meeting to accept the task assigned by the higher Party committee to plant 1,200 mu of cotton after the rain. At the meeting, the confused ideas and concerns of some Party members were criticized. Comrade Guo Linzhou (village chief), a member of the branch committee, used the facts that Zhang Pinglu in the village regretted not planting cotton last year and suffered losses, and that he took the lead in planting more cotton and benefited, to encourage everyone's emotions. Everyone made plans at the meeting, and generally guaranteed to plant about 30% of the land with cotton. Each person also guaranteed to lead at least two households to plant more.

    The branch organized separate meetings of various mass organizations, administrative cadres, and militia in the village to help them make plans. All 18 militiamen in the village made guarantees. Yang Yunqi made a plan to mobilize his family and seven neighbors to plant more. The cadres made specific divisions of labor, dividing the village into five major areas for leadership, with four or five people in each group, each leading two or three households, to ensure the completion and exceeding of the task. The cadres were in high spirits and determined to strive for the model flag for cotton planting.

    In order to strengthen the leading role, Party members adopted the method of "three checks and four comparisons" to promote the work. The three checks are: check cotton seeds (how much is missing, soaking seed technology), check cotton fields (how much land is reserved, how is the harrowing), check the mu number (the proportion of cotton planting mu number to the total land mu number). The four comparisons are to compare who plants more cotton, leads more households, organizes more inter-family mutual assistance to solve individual difficulties, and whose working methods are good without forcing orders.

    Due to the door-to-door mobilization by Party members and cadres, it was found that a few people were afraid of requisition in the autumn and did not report the actual planted mu number. For example, Li Zhongsan planted four mu but only reported three mu. Some people hesitated even after making a plan. For example, Li Luolin wanted to plant less because he was short of 15 catties of seeds. After being discovered, explanations were made, and Luolin was lent 15 catties of seeds. Party members and cadres also used the broadcast station blackboard newspaper to promptly commend active people who planted more cotton. The masses all said: "Planting more cotton is really both beneficial and famous." All 21 households of martyrs, soldiers, and workers in the village, including 12 households cultivated on their behalf, completed the plan to plant more cotton under the guarantee of the Party members and cadres in charge. The seven households of elderly, widowed, and weak people also planted cotton using the method of exchanging labor and the help of relatives, neighbors, and cadres.

    During planting, Party members put forward the slogan of "grinding rice and flour to free up livestock to plant the land quickly" according to the village's agricultural implements and livestock situation. All 60 livestock in the village, except for two that were sick and one that was raising young livestock and could not be used, were used for plowing, harrowing, and sowing. Because cotton planting required many people, each family partnered up and worked together. Many women went to the fields to pull stone rollers. As of April 29, Guo Jiazhuang had completed the sowing task of 1,200 mu of cotton fields. The masses are continuing to plant and estimate that they can exceed the task by more than 50 mu.

    After the sowing was completed, the Party members checked the seedling emergence and found that individual households had poor seed soaking and sowing techniques, and the cotton seed germination rate was low. Guo Laolu used boiling water to soak the seeds for too long, and no seedlings emerged from seven mu of cotton fields. The village lent cotton seeds again for replanting. Party members and cadres held a meeting on April 30 and decided to call on the masses to generally check the cotton seed survival rate. If the seedlings do not emerge fully, use transplanting in watery land and replanting in dry land to ensure full seedling emergence. As Guo Linzhou (village chief), a member of the branch committee, said, "Eating a full meal, doing the work, planting cotton and not having full seedling emergence is not complete."

　　支部努力保证完成种棉任务
    河北安次中所村党员带头订计划
    河北省安次县中所村全村共有土地二千二百七十八亩，除坑凹地、树秸地、秋麦地外，只有白地七百九十二亩。但由于支部领导有力，现已基本上完成上级给予的种棉一千亩的任务。这村支部共有党员七名，支书孙宝林兼任村长，副支书刘宝珍（女）兼妇女会副主任。支部工作基础很好，农民也素有种棉习惯。今春支部根据白地亩原决议种棉六百亩。四月十九日区代表会上却分给了一千亩的任务。正副支书孙宝林、刘宝珍愉快地接受了这个艰巨的任务，回村后，根据本村土质及各种农作物面积，作了分析与研究后，即召开全体党员会议，进行传达。刘宝珍同志恳切地动员大家要保证百分之百的完成任务。但一般党员信心不足。这时刘宝珍向大家报告了自己的计划：“我十四亩地，种了五亩秋麦，白地九亩我都种棉花，麦垄里再种四亩。”并动员大家带动群众。这样全体党员都提出要把所有能种棉的土地（包括树行，麦地）都种上棉花。党内思想统一后，紧接着召开村各部门扩干会议。当时有的干部提出说：“种一千亩，咱们村白地都不够数，完不成任务！”刘宝珍便向大家说：“咱们村各种工作都不落后，两次打堤都得了奖旗，都是模范。这次种棉更要争取模范。只要我们干部积极努力，起模范带头作用，完成任务是不成问题的。”紧接着党员干部们都把自己的种棉计划向大家报告。干部们听了党员的计划，思想也打通了。当场农会主任郭成朝（非党员）即提出：“我把能种棉花的地，保证都种上棉花。”当晚又召开了群众大会，聘请了有二十年种棉经经验的老农陈玉亭报告植棉方法。又邀请了种棉发家的老农娄万成报告他植棉发家的事实。会上干部党员向群众报告自己的植棉计划。随后孙宝林、刘宝珍又报告城乡互助及八至十斤小米棉价的政策，号召群众自报植棉计划。经过了讨论，各户自报计划共种八百九十六亩（包括党员干部在内）。为了保证计划不落空，干部党员分工到各户检查种棉地数与棉籽数。支部又召集党员开会，研究如何完成千亩棉田任务。会上大家认为村东大垄麦田可在背上种棉花，便决定党员带头先种。会后又发现积极分子娄万成也计划在麦田内兼种棉花，支部便抓住他这个典型，召开群众大会作介绍。支部再一次号召群众作计划，党员又带头报告个人计划，会后二十八户群众又作出新计划，全村总计可种一千零七亩棉花。
    计划订好后，刘宝珍以妇女会副主任身份召开了全村妇女大会，动员大家拣籽（因去年收成不好，籽杂）。刘宝珍原来在妇女中威信很高，在她的号召下，一百五十二名妇女参加了拣籽。三天工夫，拣完了该村六千八百四十三斤棉籽，并且又快又纯，廊坊棉产指导区与县人民政府特赠给了模范奖旗一面。
    为了解决劳动力不足的困难，刘宝珍决心将妇女发动起来。首先在支部会上研究作出决定，妇女识字班暂时停课。借识字班上课的机会，刘宝珍动员模范妇女要响应上级植棉号召，参加田间劳动，还要在植棉中成为劳动模范。并号召妇女们自愿结成互助组。会后刘宝珍首先组成了一个小组（三个妇女一个男的），半天种棉七亩，在她的影响下，大部青壮妇女都参加劳动，张万春（女）小组一天种棉九亩，十七岁的丁常荣（妇女识字班学员）与他婆母三天拣完了五亩地的石头子（铁路两旁的地），她家共种了二十一亩棉花。就这样，全村八十九个妇女与男子结成了十六个互助组，解决了人力不足的困难。截至四月三十日止，全村已种上八百五十亩，并在继续播种中。

    郭家庄支部保证出全苗
    河北省束鹿县六区郭家庄，全村土地四千六百三十六亩（今年麦田占八百多亩），绝大部分是旱地。区分配这村种棉任务原为八百五十亩，四月十五日雨后，增到一千二百亩。占全村总土地百分之二十五强。
    郭家庄支部为了保证种棉任务的完成，下雨前就召集全体党员研究准备工作。党员首先作出自己的种棉计划，并着手准备棉籽，各户存有棉籽五千斤，不够时再到辛集去买。为了解决棉田缺肥困难，组织群众买豆饼一千斤，一般棉田能施肥一、二车。
    四月十五日雨未停，支部即召开紧急会议，接受了上级党给予的雨后种棉一千二百亩的任务。会上批判了党员中的一些糊涂思想和顾虑，支委郭林舟（村长）同志用去年本村张平路不种棉吃亏后悔，和自己带头多种棉得利的事实，鼓励了大家的情绪。大家都在会上订出了计划，一般全能保证把百分之三十左右的土地种棉花。每人最少还保证带动两户群众多种。
    支部有组织的分别发动村中各群众团体、行政干部、民兵等召开了会议，帮助他们订出计划。全村民兵十八人，都提出了保证。杨运起订计划动员本家和邻居七户多种。干部们具体分工，全村分五大片领导，四、五人一组，每人领导二、三户，一定保证完成和超过任务。干部们情绪很高，决心争取种棉模范旗。
    为了加强领导作用，党员中又采取三查四比的办法，以推动工作。三查是：查棉籽（缺多少、浸种技术）、查棉田（留出多少地、打耙的怎样）、查亩数（种棉亩数占总地亩数比例）。四比是比谁种棉多、带动户多、组织插伙互助解决个别困难多、谁的工作办法好不强迫命令等。
    由于党员干部挨户深入动员，发现少数群众怕秋后起征，不报实种亩数。如李仲三种了四亩只报三亩。有的人则订了计划还犹豫，如李洛林因为差十五斤籽想少种。经发觉后都进行了解释，又贷给洛林十五斤籽。党员干部并利用广播台黑板报及时表扬多种棉的积极群众，群众都说：“多种棉花真是又有利又有名”。全村烈、军、工属共二十一户，其中代耕的十二户，都在党员干部分工保证下，完成了多种棉的计划。孤寡老弱七户也都用换工做活和亲戚邻居干部帮助的办法种上了棉花。
    下种时，党员根据全村农具牲口情况，提出推碾拉磨人作活，留出牲口紧种地的口号。全村大小六十头牲口除了二头有病，一头养小牲口不能使外，其余五十七头牲口都用到了耕耙耩种上。因种棉需人多，各家都搭起犋插着作活，许多妇女下地拉砘子。截至四月二十九日止，郭家庄已全部完成了一千二百亩棉田的播种任务。群众并在继续耩种，估计能超过任务五十亩以上。
    下完种后，党员们又检查了出苗情况，发现有个别户浸种和播种技术不好，棉籽发芽率低。郭老路因为用开水浸种时间过长，七亩棉田都没出芽，村上又贷给棉籽重种。党员干部于四月三十日开会决定，号召群众普遍检查棉籽成活率。如苗出不全的，水地用移苗、旱地用补苗办法补救，以保证全苗。正如支委郭林舟（村长）说的，“吃饭吃饱，作活作了，种棉花不全苗活不算完”。（石家庄地委宣传部方育）
