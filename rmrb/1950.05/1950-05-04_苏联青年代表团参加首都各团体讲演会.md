Following him, the young scientist Mergelyan, the socialist labor hero Bakadzheria, a member of the Georgian collective farm, and the combat hero Kozhedub gave speeches.

Their speeches won warm cheers and applause. In the Youth Palace, 800 children of the new China warmly welcomed Dumanova, editor of the Soviet "Pioneer Truth" newspaper, as well as Jikkina and Shatunov. They introduced the situation of the Soviet Young Pioneers and their role in the Soviet Patriotic War and post-war construction. The children present gave the Soviet Youth Delegation the glorious symbol of the Chinese Young Pioneers—the red scarf—as well as their own calligraphy, handicrafts, toys, etc. In addition, the Soviet youth representatives also attended a lecture meeting at the Russian Language College and a symposium on youth workers' work held by the Youth League Central Committee's youth workers.
