　　Shop Assistants Help Capitalists Overcome Difficulties
    Nanchang Zhonghua Book Company Turns from Loss to Profit
    [This Newspaper Dispatches] In order to help the capitalist overcome difficulties, the shop assistants of the Nanchang Zhonghua Book Company actively put forward suggestions for improving business and voluntarily reduced their wages. Under the promotion of the shop assistants, the capitalist increased their confidence in the operation. The company has turned from loss to profit. In the past, the main business of Zhonghua Book Company was selling textbooks. After liberation, because most of the textbooks in stock were not applicable, business was extremely bleak. The company had 300,000 textbooks in stock, with accumulated funds of over 250 million yuan. The capitalist, due to a lack of understanding of the policies, adopted a passive and pessimistic attitude, ignoring the ups and downs of the business, and attempted to simply close down. In order to assist the capitalist in overcoming difficulties, the shop assistants of the store actively put forward specific measures to improve business and save expenses. In terms of business operations, they proposed the policy of selling stationery and promoting progressive books, adopting a method of small profits and quick turnover. In order to save expenses, the shop assistants voluntarily reduced the standard of meals, changing from four dishes and one soup to two dishes and one soup, and stipulated methods for saving water, electricity, and daily necessities. All employees voluntarily reduced their salaries, reducing a total of eleven dan and five dou of rice per month. In order to improve work efficiency, the shop assistants consciously formulated labor discipline. In terms of management methods, a new regular business meeting was established through consultation with the capitalist, making it easier for shop assistants to put forward suggestions for improving business. Under the influence of the shop assistants, the capitalist changed their attitude towards management, also changed their view of belittling the shop assistants, and actively managed the business, which improved day by day. Previously, the daily business income was at most more than 400,000 yuan and at least more than 100,000 yuan. In the first week after improving business, the average daily income was more than 500,000 yuan, and by December of last year, there was a surplus. Under the influence of Zhonghua Book Company, the city's World Book Company, Hengdeli Watch Shop, and other companies have strengthened the unity between labor and capital in this spirit to overcome difficulties in operation.

　　店员帮助资方克服困难
    南昌中华书局由亏转盈
    【本报讯】南昌市中华书局店员为了帮助资方克服困难，积极提出改进业务意见，并自动降低工资。资方在店员推动下，增加了经营的信心。该局已由亏累转为有了盈余。中华书局过去主要的业务是出售教科书籍，解放后因所存教科书多不适用，营业异常清淡。该局库存教科书达卅万册，积压资金合二亿五千余万元。资方由于不了解政策，抱消极悲观态度，对营业盛衰不问不闻，企图以停业了之。该店店员为协助资方克服困难，积极提出改进业务及节省开支等具体办法。在经营业务方面，提出出售文具和推销进步书籍的方针，采取薄利广销的办法。为节省开支，店员们自动降低伙食标准，由四菜一汤改为二菜一汤，并规定了水电及日常用品的节约办法。全体员工自动减薪，每月共减低薪资米十一石五斗。为提高工作效率，店员们又自觉的订立了劳动纪律。在管理方法上，经与资方协商，建立了新的定期的业务会议，便利店员提出改进业务意见。在店员的影响下，资方改变了经营的态度，也转变了轻视店员的观点，积极经营，营业日有起色。以前每日营业收入最多四十余万，最少十余万元，改进业务后的第一星期，每日平均收入五十余万元，至去年十二月份即有了盈余。在中华书局的影响下，该市世界书局、亨德利钟表店等均按此精神加强劳资团结，克服经营中的困难。
