    Anti-Foreman Struggle Is About to Begin
    Jiaozuo Miners Urgently Demand the Eradication of Remaining Foreman Elements
    [Special dispatch from our newspaper] Reporter Lin Li reports: In the coal mines under the Jingxing Mining Bureau, remnants of the feudal foremen system still exist. They continue to suppress workers, seriously hindering production. The mine has now decided to thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the foremen system as the current focus of work. Among cadres at the group leader level and above in the mine, there are more than 190 foremen of various sizes, accounting for about 54% of the total number of group and section chiefs. They control the hiring and firing of workers, and it is difficult for those who have no relationship with the foremen to be hired. Most of the group leaders, section chiefs, etc., promoted underground are relatives and friends of the foremen. These foremen can dismiss workers at will and carry out disguised economic exploitation of workers, such as imposing black marks, borrowing grain, and accepting gifts. They outwardly comply with but inwardly oppose the administrative leadership. Administrative resolutions and instructions cannot be implemented if they disagree. Naturally, the workers' correct opinions cannot be reflected. These foremen are extremely backward and conservative and refuse to accept new things, becoming a serious obstacle to improving production technology. In particular, they neglect safety work, so underground safety regulations are difficult to implement. Based on the above, the mine affirms that foremen are a stumbling block to production development and lists the thorough elimination of foreman remnants as the current work priority. The Mining Bureau, the Jingxing Mining Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the trade union have jointly formulated specific measures to combat foreman remnants. On April 20, the mine held a workers' representative meeting to specifically deploy the work of eliminating foreman remnants.
    [Report from our newspaper] The workers of Jiaozuo Coal Mine urgently demand the thorough elimination of the remaining forces of the foreman system. At present, the lower-level production organizations of the mine are still controlled by the old contractor foremen, bosses, and supervisors. According to statistics from Wangfeng Mine, there are still 35 old foremen, etc., in the lower-level organizations, continuing to rule over the workers. A popular saying among the workers is: "What people did in the past, they still do today! Those who oppressed us in the past lead us today!" These old foremen, supervisors, etc., can arbitrarily insult workers and even dismiss workers without administrative approval. They deliberately suppress active elements in production. The workers call them "a wall," and the workers say: "The leadership only asks us for coal, but you don't even know when we are injured." This fully demonstrates that the workers not only urgently demand the abolition of the foreman remnants but also demand that the leadership come out of the office, approach the workers, and implement democratic management.

　　井陉矿务局所属各矿
    反把头斗争即将开始         
    焦作矿工迫切要求肃清把头残余
    【本报专讯】记者林里报道：井陉矿务局所属各煤矿，封建把头残余仍然存在。他们继续压制工人，严重地阻碍着生产，该矿现已决定将彻底肃清把头残余，作为当前的工作重点。该矿组长以上干部中，有大小把头一百九十余名，约占组长股长总人数的百分之五十四。他们掌握着工人的雇用与辞退权，和把头没有关系的人很难被雇用，井下被提拔的组长、股长等，多是把头的亲朋。这些把头可以随意开除工人，对工人实行变相的经济剥削，如挂黑牌，借粮，受礼物等。他们对行政领导上阳奉阴违。行政上的决议指示，他们如不同意，就贯彻不下去。工人的正确意见，当然也就反映不上来。这些把头极端落后和保守，拒不接受新事物。成为目前改进生产技术的严重障碍。他们尤其忽视保安工作，因此井下保安规章很难推行。根据上述各节，该矿肯定把头是发展生产的绊脚石，把彻底扫清把头残余列为目前工作重点，矿务局和中共井陉矿党委、工会已共同拟定反把头残余的具体办法。四月二十日该矿已召开职工代表大会，具体布置扫清把头残余的工作。
    【本报讯】焦作煤矿职工迫切要求彻底肃清把头残余势力。目前该矿下层生产组织，依然为过去的包工工头及老板、监工所把持。据王封矿统计：在下层组织中，尚有旧工头等三十五人，继续站在工人之上进行统治。工人中普遍流传着：“过去人家干啥，今天人家还干啥！过去人家压迫咱，今天人家领导咱！”的说法。这些旧工头、监工等，可以随便污骂工人，甚至不经行政批准，即可开除工人。他们对于生产中的积极分子更是有意打击。工人称他们为“一堵墙”，工人说：“领导上光给咱们要煤，我们受了伤，你们也不知道”。这充分表现出工人不仅迫切要求废除把头残余，而且要求领导上能走出办公室，接近工人，实行民主管理。（萧雨）
