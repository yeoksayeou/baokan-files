　　Qiqihar Clothing Factory's Technical Exhibition

    In order to improve quality, reduce rework, and encourage workers to learn technology, the Qiqihar Clothing Factory adopted the method of holding technical exhibitions for publicity and mobilization.

    Technical exhibitions are held in both large and small scales, complementing each other.

    Before a large-scale exhibition is held, quality standards are first determined. After each batch of production tasks is assigned, the best products from all workers are selected and set as one hundred points. For example, this year's soldier uniforms are divided into ten parts: collar, pocket, cuff, sleeve attachment, front placket, topstitching, trouser seam, waistband, front crotch, and bottom crotch, each part accounting for ten points.

    The standard quality for general workers' products is 95 points. Workers who score 95 points or above receive bonus wages; those who score less than 95 points have their wages reduced; those who score less than 93 points have the deficient portions reworked; and those who score 92 points have the entire product reworked.

    The exhibition is divided into four parts: (1) Exhibition of good products: Products from workers such as Li Chunsheng and others, which consistently score no less than 95 points, are displayed for everyone to learn from. (2) Exhibition of bad products: For example, the products of temporary worker Li Huanzhang, which often score below 93 points, are also exhibited. After participating in the exhibition, he said, "I feel embarrassed when people look at me and my work." Later, his work also improved to 94 points. (3) Exhibition of comparable products for everyone to carefully compare and emulate the good ones. (4) Exhibition of improved products: For example, the products of worker Hua Deshan, whose product quality was not good before but has since improved, are also displayed to encourage everyone to learn.

    After the exhibition, group discussions are organized to study ways to improve quality. Such exhibitions should not be held too frequently, depending on the specific circumstances. Exhibitions can be organized appropriately when quality issues are discovered.

    Small-scale exhibitions are temporary and flexible methods for correcting quality declines in some workers' products. For example, the product quality of several workers, such as Hua Deshan and Yang Fushan, declined during a certain period. The factory used the lunch break time to display their work and call everyone to visit. The workers all knew that Hua Deshan's technique was good, and the quality decline was caused by "rushing the job." After everyone pointed out the problems with the products, Hua Deshan corrected the shortcomings. Since then, his work has consistently maintained a quality of 95 points or above.

    Due to the stimulation of the technical exhibitions, the product quality of the clothing factory has generally improved. Previously, among the 43 workers in the clothing factory, only four or five could reach 95 points; most were between 94 and 93 points, and one or two workers often scored below 93 points. Now, products with a quality of 95 points or above account for one-half of the workers, 94 points account for one-half, and only occasionally do 93-point products appear. It has basically eliminated 93-point products.

### 齐市被服厂的技术展览会

　　齐市被服厂的技术展览会
    为了提高质量，减少反工现象，发动工友学习技术，齐齐哈尔市被服厂采取了举行技术展览会的宣传鼓动方法。
    技术展览会分大型、小型两种，互相配合举行。
    大型展览举行之前，首先确定质量标准。在每一批生产任务下来后，即从全体工友的产品中选出最好的，订为一百分。例如今年的战士服，分领子、口袋、袖头、上袖子、前对襟、明线、裤线、裤腰、前裆、下裆等十部分，每部分各占十分。
    一般工友的产品，以九十五分为标准质量，九十五分以上的给奖励工资，少于九十五分的减薪，少于九十三分的部分反工，九十二分的全部反工。
    展览会分四部分：（一）展览好的：如李春生等四名工友的产品，经常不少于九十五分，提出来展览，供大家学习。（二）展览坏的：如临时工李焕章，产品经常在九十三分以下。工厂也把他的产品展览。他参加展览之后说：“人家看看我，看看我的活，真难为情。”以后，他的活也提高到九十四分了。（三）展览同等的活，供大家仔细比较，向好的看齐。（四）展览有进步的：如华德山工友，以前产品质量不够好，后来进步了。也拿来展览，以鼓励大家学习。
    展览会完毕之后，再组织小组讨论，研究改进质量的办法。这种展览会举行次数不要太频繁。看具体情况而定。如发现质量不好时可适当组织展览。
    小型的展览是纠正部分工友质量降低的临时零活办法。例如华德山、杨福山等几名工友的产品在一个时期质量降低了。工厂就利用吃午饭后休息的时间，把他们的活摆出来，召集大家来参观。工友们都知道华德山的技术不错，质量降低是“赶件子”造成的。大家提出产品的毛病后，华德山纠正了缺点。从那回起，他的活一直保持着九十五分以上的质量。
    由于技术展览会的刺激，被服厂的产品质量一般地提高了。如以前在被服厂的四十三名工友中能达到九十五分的只有四、五人；一般都在九十四分和九十三分之间，还有一两名工友常常在九十三分以下。现在，产品质量达九十五分以上的占工友的二分之一，九十四分的占二分之一，只有偶尔出现九十三分的。已做到基本上消灭了九十三分的产品。
