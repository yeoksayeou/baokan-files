　　Special-Class Learning Model Liu Fengxi

　　Liu Fengxi, a special-class learning model from Songjiang Province, is a winter school student from Xiaotangdaogou, Third District, Ning'an County. He is 43 years old this year and comes from a poor peasant family. During the puppet Manchukuo era, he worked as a long-term laborer for landlords for eleven years and was then forced into hard labor for three years. After the arrival of the Communist Party, he was allocated four *qiang* (ten acres) of land, and he also reclaimed two *qiang* of wasteland, which improved his life.

　　He has always been active in his work. During this year's winter school movement, he not only took the lead in participating in learning but also came up with many ways to mobilize the villagers throughout the village. He also found ways to solve various difficulties in the winter school and ensured the smooth progress of the winter school work in his village. As a result, he became a winter school model for the entire county.

　　There are more than 40 military families in Xiaotangtougou (out of a total of 150 households in the village), and they constantly receive letters from the front. However, they are all illiterate, so they cannot read the letters or write back. Everyone feels this is very difficult.

　　Liu Fengxi saw this point and, after the harvest last year, first mobilized the military dependents to organize literacy classes. He also helped them dispel concerns such as "dull minds" and "no time." As a result, 26 women participated in the literacy class.

　　Soon after the literacy class was established, the county came to help run the winter school. He was the first to sign up and thought of various ways to mobilize more than 50 people to attend school.

　　However, at that time, the masses did not have much confidence, their morale was not high, and there were many concerns in their minds.

　　One day, the district sent a notice asking everyone to buy the "Farmers' Cultural Textbook." He took out 200,000 yuan (Northeast currency) and borrowed another 300,000 yuan to buy more than 60 books and distributed them to everyone. When the students saw the books, they said, "Everyone is learning the same thing, why should Liu Fengxi pay for the books?" Everyone immediately pooled money to return it to him. He said, "After the Communist Party came, I was allocated land and property, and I have a good life now. What's it matter to spend a little money for running the winter school?"

　　Once, the winter school ran out of firewood. He braved the snow early in the morning with his son, Liu Wenhai, to hitch up the sled and go up the mountain to chop firewood. When the students found out about this, they felt very sorry and sent more than 50 carts of branches and rough firewood (this firewood has not been used up to this day), one cart or sled at a time.

　　Liu Fengxi is not only responsible for the winter school work in this way, but he is also very enthusiastic about his own studies. He always scores at the top in every test. Initially, he encountered many difficulties in learning: he saw a black mass of strokes in characters with many strokes and didn't know where to start writing; sometimes he would forget two characters the day after he learned them. But he always learned patiently and carefully, stroke by stroke. He said, "People who have been holding hoes all year round are bound to have some difficulties when they first pick up a pen. But as long as you study hard, you will learn it sooner or later."

　　When he went up the mountain to chop firewood, he would turn the "sickle handle" upside down and practice writing in the snow whenever he had time. When the people in the village found out, they also started practicing writing in the same way. From then on, many "snow characters" of different sizes appeared all over the hillside.

　　One day, the number of people attending winter school suddenly decreased by more than half, especially the female students. Seeing this situation, he carefully went to the masses to investigate the reason and learned that something had happened in the village during the day.

　　It turned out that the day before, their winter school teacher, Zhao Laowu, went to Dongtun to help teach winter school and stayed overnight because it was too late. The next day, someone named Sun Shiliang spread a rumor: "Zhao Laowu went to Dongtun yesterday, pretending to teach winter school, to mess around with women..." As soon as this spread, the elders of each family stopped letting women go to school.

　　Liu Fengxi felt that this was a big problem. That night, he discussed it with the winter school committee, convened a meeting of male and female students attending school, and also brought Sun Shiliang. He and the cadres exposed Sun Shiliang's rumor in front of everyone and found the old ladies and women from the military families to testify. In the end, Sun Shiliang admitted his mistake and said, "This is my fault. Because I didn't want to go to winter school, I made up rumors. I will definitely not do such immoral things again in the future."

　　Everyone understood the matter and went to school happily again. Later, with Liu Fengxi's help, Sun Shiliang gradually learned well and also went to winter school. He now recognizes more than 300 characters.

　　There was a "Laowu" in the village who also signed up for winter school, but he never went to school once. One day, he wanted to go to town to inquire about a deal, and he was afraid of forgetting things, so he asked someone to write him a note to take with him. When Liu Fengxi found out, he wrote a note and asked a child to send it to Laowu. Laowu had a hard time finding someone who could read to read it to him. It turned out that it said: "Laowu, Laowu, it's really hard to be illiterate, you still need a guide when you go out." Laowu thought: "Liu Fengxi and I used to be illiterate. Now people can already write. I don't even recognize a single character, and I was lectured by someone." From then on, Laowu went to winter school every day and even challenged Liu Fengxi, saying: "I must catch up with you."

　　Around the Spring Festival this year, he wanted to understand the students' learning achievements, so he mobilized everyone to write letters to the soldiers at the front. In addition to writing general letters of comfort, many women also wrote letters to their husbands. One military dependent even challenged her husband: "Let's see who recognizes more characters." He also mobilized everyone to write letters to each other in the village.

　　He is so enthusiastic about learning, but he has not delayed sideline production. This winter, he hunted two sables and more than 500 *jin* of firewood, selling them for more than two million yuan. He also collected five carts of manure. He said, "If we do a good job in sideline production, spring plowing will not be difficult." He also organized groups to engage in sideline production collectively: men went up the mountain to chop firewood and hunt sables, and women helped each other weed at home. Their group earned more than 80 million yuan in Northeast currency through sideline production this winter.

　　When the county held a meeting to reward learning models, their village received a prize banner.

　　特等学习模范刘凤喜
    松江省特等学习模范刘凤喜，是宁安县三区小唐道沟的冬学学员。今年四十三岁，贫农出身。伪满时代，他给地主扛了十一年大活，又被抓去做了三年苦工。共产党到来以后，他分得了四垧（十亩）地，自己又开了两垧荒，日子才好过了。
    他工作一贯积极。今年冬学运动里，他不仅自己带头参加学习，同时还想了许多办法，把全屯的老乡也发动起来。并且设法解决了冬学中的各种困难，保证了本屯冬学工作的顺利进行。他因此成为全县的冬学模范。
    小唐头沟有四十多户军属（全屯共一百五十来户人家），他们不断从前方接到来信。但是他们都不识字，既不能看信，也不能写回信。大家都觉得很困难。
    刘凤喜看到了这一点，在去年打完场以后，就首先向军属妇女们动员组织识字班。并帮助他们解除了“脑筋笨”、“没时间”等顾虑。这样，便有二十六名妇女参加了识字班。
    识字班成立不久，县里就来帮助办冬学。他第一个报名参加了，并想了各种办法动员五十多人上了学。
    但当时群众的信心不大，情绪也不高，思想上存在着很多顾虑。
    有一天，区上来通知，让大家买“农民文化课本”。他就拿出二十来万块钱（东北币），又借了三十来万块钱，买来六十多本书发给大伙。学员们看到了书，就说：“大家都是一样学习，为啥叫刘凤喜拿钱买书呢？”大家当场就凑钱还他。他说：“共产党来了，我分得了土地、财产，有好日子过了。这回为办冬学，花几个钱算啥？”
    有一次，冬学没有柴火了。他一清早就冒着雪和儿子刘文海套上爬犁，上山去打柴。学员知道了这件事，都很过意不去，便你一车、他一爬犁的送来五十多车条子和毛柴（这些柴火一直到今天还没烧完）。
    刘凤喜不但对冬学工作这样负责，自己的学习也非常热心。每回测验他都考在前头。最初，他在学习上遇到了很多困难：看到笔划多的字黑呼呼一片，也不知从那下笔；有时刚学会两个字第二天就忘了。可是他总是耐心的一笔一划的认真地学着。他说：“年年拿锄杆的人，刚一拿起笔杆，免不了有些困难。可是只要用心学，早晚也能学会的。”
    他在上山打柴火时，一有空便把“镰刀把”倒过来，在雪地上练字。屯子里的人知道了，也都照样的练起字来。从此，整个山坡上就出现了许多大小不一的“雪字”。
    有一天，上冬学的人数忽然减少了一大半，尤其是女学员来的更少。他看到这个情况，就细心地到群众中去调查这件事的原因，知道白天屯子里出了一件事。
    原来头一天他们的冬学老师赵老五到东屯帮助教冬学，因为太晚就住下啦。第二天有个叫孙士良的就造谣：“赵老五昨天上东屯，假装教冬学，去搞女人……。”这样一传扬，各家的老人都不叫妇女上学了。
    刘凤喜觉得这是个大问题。当天晚上就和冬学委员会商量，召集上学的男女学员开会，并把孙士良也找去。他和干部当着大伙揭穿了孙士良的造谣，并找出军属家的老太太和妇女们对证。最后孙士良承认了错误，说：“这是我的错。因为我不愿意上冬学，就瞎造谣。以后我一定不再做这样缺德的事了。”
    大家明白了这件事，就又热热闹闹地上学了。后来，孙士良在刘凤喜的帮助下，慢慢地学好了，也上了冬学。现在已经认得三百多字了。
    屯子里有个“老五”，也在冬学报了名，可是一次也没去上过学。有一天，他要进城打听一宗买卖，怕忘了事，便求人给写了一个条带着。刘凤喜知道了，就写了一个字条子，叫小孩给老五送去。老五好容易找个识字的人给念了一遍。原来上边写着：“老五，老五，不识字真叫苦，出门还得用个领道的。”老五一想：“刘凤喜和我原先都是不识字的。现在人家已经能写字了。我自己连一个字都不识，还叫人家说了一顿。”从那以后，老五就每天上冬学，还和刘凤喜挑战说：“我一定要撵上你。”
    今年春节前后，他想了解一下学员们的学习成绩，就发动大伙给前方战士们写信。除了写一般的慰问信之外，许多妇女还给丈夫写了信。有一个军属还和丈夫挑了战：“看谁认的字多。”另外在本屯子里他又发动大家互相写信。
    他这样热心学习，但并没有耽误副业生产。这一冬他打了两个黄皮子和五百多斤柴火，卖了二百多万元。又捡了五车粪。他说：“搞好了副业，春耕生产就不困难了。”他还组织小组集体搞副业：男人上山打柴、撵皮子，女人在家互助锄草。他们那一小组这一冬天靠副业生产就挣了八千多万元东北币。
    县里召开奖励学习模范大会的时候，他们的屯子得了一面奖旗。
