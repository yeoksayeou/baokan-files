Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to the Northeast Daily, the twelve state-owned mechanical farms in Northeast China mobilized more than 200 tractors in early April to carry out spring plowing and sowing. They have now completed the sowing of more than 11,000 hectares of spring wheat. Most farms are seizing the appropriate planting season from the Beginning of Summer to Grain Full to rush to sow soybeans. This year, the twelve mechanical farms plan to sow more than 11,800 hectares of soybeans, sorghum, and other crops, ensuring that all spring plowing and sowing is completed before Mangzhong (Grain in Ear, June 6th). Recently, there has been pervasive and thorough rainfall in the northern farms. Coupled with mechanized operations, deep plowing and uniform sowing, wheat seedlings are growing very vigorously. In the eastern mechanical farms such as Yong'an, Huannan, and Ning'an, where wheat was sown earlier, the wheat seedlings have already grown to four inches.

This year, all state-owned mechanical farms in Northeast China carried out thorough preparation work before spring plowing and sowing. Since last winter, all farms have prepared a large number of high-quality varieties. Most of the wheat seeds have been disinfected. Farm machinery workers have overcome difficulties in materials and technology to prepare sufficient equipment. The Public Farm Administration Bureau and its affiliated agricultural machinery factories have also provided appropriate cooperation in the production of agricultural implements and the repair of machinery. Before the spring plowing, the bureau also held two training courses, training 222 key members of the farm drivers, taking the cultivation technology a step further.

All farms implemented intensive and meticulous farming in the spring plowing. All farms attached great importance to land preparation. The raw wasteland opened up last year but not harrowed was harrowed three to four times to make it suitable for sowing and crop growth. In terms of plowing and harrowing methods, all farms were able to carry out reasonable tractor operation methods to prevent the work quality from being reduced. The land that was rolled after sowing this year is very flat, eliminating the phenomenon of soil clods and grass roots remaining in the ground and uneven plowing last year.

Due to the combined use of various agricultural implements, the operating efficiency of state-owned mechanical farms has been unprecedentedly improved. Last year, a 52-horsepower Stetetz tractor only towed one seeder, sowing 3.6 meters wide in one pass. This year, due to combined use, three seeders are towed at a time, sowing 10.8 meters wide in one pass. The workload per hour increased from 1.5 hectares to 4 hectares. Last year, each hectare of sowing used more than 4 kilograms of oil, while this year the oil consumption in spring plowing in various places was lower than 4 kilograms, greatly reducing the fuel cost of mechanical farms.

　　东北十二个国营机械农场
　　完成春麦播种现正赶种大豆
    各种机械农具连结使用，效率空前提高。
    【新华社十六日讯】据东北日报消息：东北十二个国营机械农场于四月初出动二百余台拖拉机开始进行春耕播种，现已全部完成一万一千余垧春麦播种任务，大部农场正抓紧立夏至小满的适种时节，赶播大豆。今年十二个机械农场共计划播种大豆、高粱等作物一万一千八百余垧，保证于芒种（六月六日）前全部结束春耕播种。近日北部各农场普落透雨，加以机械作业，耕的深，种的匀，麦苗十分旺盛；东部种麦较早的永安、桦南、宁安等机械农场麦苗已长至四寸。
    今年东北各国营机械农场在春耕播种前均进行了充分的准备工作。各场远自去冬即筹备了大批优良品种，大部小麦种籽均消了毒；农场机械工人克服材料及技术等方面的困难，准备了足够的器材；公营农场管理局及所属农具工厂也在制作农具和检修机械方面给以适当的配合。该局在春耕前并举办了两期训练班，训练了二百二十二名农场驾驶员中的骨干分子，将耕种技术提高了一步。
    各农场在春耕中都贯彻了精耕细作。各场对整地工作极为重视，对于去年开出而未耙的生荒，均耙了三遍至四遍，以便适于播种及作物的生育。在耕耙方法上各农场都能按照合理的拖拉机工作法进行，使工作质量不致降低；今年播种后经过碾压的地，都非常平坦，消除了去年土块草根留在地里、耕地凹凸不平的现象。
    由于各种农具的连结使用，各国营机械农场作业效率空前提高。去年一台五十二马力的斯特兹号拖拉机只牵引一台播种机，一趟播种三·六公尺宽，而今年由于连结使用，一次牵引三台播种机，一趟能播十·八公尺宽，每小时工作量由一·五垧增加到四垧；去年各农场每垧播种用油四公斤以上，而今年春耕时各地用油均低于四公斤，使机械农场燃料成本大大降低。
