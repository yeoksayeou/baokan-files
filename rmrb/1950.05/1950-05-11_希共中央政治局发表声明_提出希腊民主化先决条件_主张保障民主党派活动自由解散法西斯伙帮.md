Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th - According to the Electronegative Communication Agency: The Central Politburo of the Greek Communist Party issued a statement on the 7th, condemning the Athens Plastiras government for betraying its election promises and continuing to pursue a pro-royalist fascist policy. The statement put forward three points as the "minimum prerequisites" for the peaceful resolution of the Greek internal situation and the democratization of Greece:

	I. Unconditionally release all fighters who fought for the people between 1941 and 1950.

	II. Restore complete democratic freedoms, restore freedom of publication, association and assembly; guarantee the safety of all citizens, guarantee the freedom of activity of all democratic organizations and parties; abolish the fascist practice of appointing administrative officials to trade unions, agricultural cooperatives and all other mass organizations, and restore the freedom of trade unions.

	III. Demobilize the army and dissolve fascist gangs, stop the activities of the secret police, and eliminate the war atmosphere artificially created by Commander-in-Chief Begeas and the military royalist clique, who maintain this atmosphere to facilitate their plans for conspiracies against the safety and peace of the people.

    【新华社十日讯】据电通社布拉格讯：希腊共产党中央政治局于七日发表声明，谴责雅典普拉斯蒂拉斯政府背弃了他的选举诺言，继续奉行保皇法西斯的政策。该声明提出三点，作为希腊国内和平解决及希腊民主化的“起码的先决条件”：
    一、无条件地释放一切在一九四一至一九五○年间为人民而斗争的战士。
    二、恢复完全的民主的自由，恢复出版、结社和集会自由；保障一切公民的安全，保障一切民主组织与党派的活动自由；废除指派行政官员到工会、农业合作社及其他一切群众组织去的法西斯作法，恢复工会的自由。
    三、使军队复员并解散法西斯伙帮，制止秘密警察的活动，消除总司令贝贝格斯和军事保皇集团人为地制造的战争气氛，他们保持这种气氛，是便于他们筹划反对人民的安全与和平的阴谋。
