To Respected Chairman Mao,

We are the workers of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau, under the North China Electric Power Administration Bureau. To welcome the first Red May since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are unleashing the power of the working class to ensure safe electricity transmission, further reduce coal consumption and line losses, more diligently manage our assets, and strictly implement budget and final accounts systems, in order to accumulate more wealth for our country.

We not only want to safely deliver electricity to the major factories in Tangshan and Beijing-Tianjin, but also to the state-owned farms in eastern Hebei. Recently, we have completed the installation of power lines to the Lutai State Farm, and have transmitted electricity there, allowing them to use our electricity for pumping water for irrigation.

In the first quarter of this year, our coal consumption was 0.584 kilograms. But since Red May, we have already reached the standard of 0.58 kilograms set for our bureau by the National Electricity Conference, line losses have also been reduced, and costs have been reduced by 13 percent compared to last year.

Respected Chairman Mao, in the future we will unite even better, improve quota management work on the existing basis, fully implement the responsibility system, to ensure safe electricity transmission. Today we are signing the first collective contract for safe power supply, and holding the opening ceremony of the first accelerated technical training class. We will complete 100% of the production tasks stipulated in the collective contract, and continuously improve our skills, to better manage our enterprise, as our gift to you in Red May.

        Respectfully wishing you good health!

                All the workers of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau, North China Electric Power Administration Bureau
                              May 16th

　　写给敬爱的毛主席
    唐山电业局职工报告生产情况敬爱的毛主席：
    我们是华北电业管理总局唐山电业局的职工。为了迎接中华人民共和国成立后第一个红五月，我们发挥着工人阶级的力量来保证安全发送电，更加减低煤耗和线路损失，更认真清理自己的财产和严格执行预决算制度，以替自己的国家积累更多的财富。
    我们不但要把电很安全地送到唐山和京津各大工厂去，并且要把电送到冀东国营农场里去。最近我们已经把通到芦台国营农场的电线架设起来了，把电通过去，让他们用我们的电来打水灌溉。
    我们在今年第一季中，煤耗是○·五八四公斤。但从红五月以来，已达到全国电业会议给我局的标准○·五八公斤，线路损失也已减少，成本则较去年减低了百分之十三。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们今后要更好的团结一致，把定额管理工作在现有基础上提高一步，全面推行负责制，以保证安全发送电。今天我们正在签订第一个安全供电的集体合同，并举行第一个技术训练速成班的开学典礼。我们要百分之百的完成集体合同所规定的生产任务，并不断提高技术，把我们的企业管理得更好，作为我们在红五月给你的献礼。
        敬祝身体健康！
                华北电业管理总局唐山电业局全体职工
                              五月十六日
