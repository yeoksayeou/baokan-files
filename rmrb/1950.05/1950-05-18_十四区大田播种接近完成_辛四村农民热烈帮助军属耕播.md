　　Fourteenth District's Large-Scale Sowing Nears Completion
　　Xin Si Village Peasants Enthusiastically Help Military Dependents with Plowing and Sowing
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Fourteenth District's large-scale field sowing (referring to rice, corn, sorghum, beans, etc.), with the exception of a few low-lying, waterlogged areas and some late-sown seed crops, is nearing completion. In the Laojuntang and Shibalidian areas, more rice has been planted this year. Liberated peasants are saying: Now that we have land, we should plant more rice to harvest more straw, to prepare for feeding livestock. The five villages of Sihaizhuang, Sihezhuang, Xiwuhao, Shitaizhuang, and Ruihezhuang have already sown 9,002 mu. According to village cadres, it is expected that all sowing will be completed before the tenth day of the fourth lunar month (May 26th). Xihongmen has completed over seventy percent of its sowing. During the sowing process, the peasants carried out labor exchange and mutual assistance, resolving the difficulties of labor and animal power shortages. Chen Baosen and five other households in the Erbaozi natural village of Shibalidian formed a labor exchange group and quickly finished plowing and sowing. Peasant Chen Li, seeing the benefits of mutual assistance, also joined. In addition, the area is planting more cotton than usual this year. Yinghaizhuang planted 1,450 mu of cotton last year and plans to plant 2,645 mu this year. In addition to the peasants finding their own solutions to the seed problem, the government has also provided loans of more than 210,000 jin. Some villages have already begun sowing.

    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Sowing is being carried out universally in various villages in the eighteenth district of the Beijing suburbs. Villages such as Zhangguozhuang, Taiziyu, Liuxiayu, Lvcun, and Lijiaoyu are planting sweet potatoes, peanuts, cotton, sorghum, and other crops. Weeding wheat and plowing land are also being carried out actively. In the spring sowing, the liberated peasants are showing even greater enthusiasm. In Liuxiayu Village, poor peasant Fan Wanzhi and his wife, with the wife leading the donkey and the husband holding the plow, plowed ten mu of sweet potato ridges in one day. The village production committee plans to lead the masses to finish planting 406 mu of sweet potato land before the fifteenth day of the fourth lunar month.

    [Another Dispatch] Party members, Youth League members, and the masses of Xin Si Village in the thirteenth district of the eastern suburbs are helping military dependents complete spring sowing. The village originally had eight military dependent households, and five more households were moved in from the city during the land reform. The thirteen military dependent households have a total of 287 mu of land. Of the military dependents, seven households with labor power have finished planting their land, while six households have no labor power or do not know how to plant (having moved from the city). In order to ensure that the military dependents' land is not left uncultivated, the village government convened a mass meeting to discuss the issue of cultivation on their behalf. Party branch secretary Wang Yongren and seven other party members signed up on the spot, willing to cultivate the land on their behalf. Deputy village chief Zhang Chun, followed by Youth League member Dong Qi, peasant Han Yongzhen, and seventeen others, also signed up in succession. The twenty-two mu of uncultivated land belonging to the six military dependent households without labor power were planted in one day thanks to everyone's efforts. During the sowing, Han Yongzhen saw that the military dependents' seeds were not good, so he replaced them with his own good seeds. Many other people were vying to cultivate on behalf of the military dependents, but because there was little land, not much labor was needed, so everyone volunteered to deliver manure to the military dependents' fields.

　　十四区大田播种接近完成
　  辛四村农民热烈帮助军属耕播
    【本报讯】十四区大田（指谷、玉米、高粱、豆类等）除少数河洼地太湿，及部分留种晚作物外，播种已将近完成。老君堂、十八里店一带，今年种谷较多。翻身农民都说：咱们有地了，多种点谷收点草，准备喂牲口。四海庄、四合庄、西五号、石太庄、瑞合庄五村已播种九千零二亩。据各村干部谈：在旧历四月初十（五月二十六日）前，可全部完成。西红门已完成播种百分之七十强。播种中，农民进行了拨工互助，解决了人力畜力缺少的困难。十八里店二堡子自然村陈宝森等六户，组成拨工组，很快地耕种完了。农民陈利看到互助的好处也加入了。另外，该区今年种棉的比常年多。瀛海庄去年种棉一千四百五十亩，今年要种二千六百四十五亩。种子问题除由农民自己想法解决外，政府并贷了二十一万多斤。有的村现在已经开始播种。

    【本报讯】京郊十八区各村普遍进行播种。张郭庄、太子峪、留霞峪、吕村、李家峪等村正种白薯、花生、棉花、高粱等作物。锄麦、耕地也正积极进行中。在春播中，翻身农民表现得更积极。留霞峪村贫农范万枝夫妇，老婆牵驴，男人扶犁，一天就打了十亩地的白薯埂。该村生产委员会计划于旧历四月十五日以前领导群众将四百零六亩白薯地种完。

    【又讯】东郊十三区辛四村党团员群众帮助军属完成春播。该村原有八户军属，土地改革时，又从城里移来五户。十三户军属共有土地二百八十七亩。军属中除七户有劳动力的将地种完外，还有六户无劳动力，或不会种（城里搬来的）。为了保证军属的土地不遭荒废，村政府便召开了群众大会，讨论代耕问题。党支书王永仁等七个党员，当场报名，愿意代耕。副村长张春，随后团员董其，农民韩永珍等十七人，也相继报名。六户无劳动力的军属的二十二亩白地，在大家努力下，一天就种完了。在播种中，韩永珍见到军属的种子不好，他便换上自己的好种子。还有很多群众争着代耕，因地少，用不了很多工，大家便自愿去给军属往地里送粪。
