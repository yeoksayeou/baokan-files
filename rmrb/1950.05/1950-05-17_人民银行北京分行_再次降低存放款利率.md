　　[News from Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China further reduced deposit and loan interest rates on the 15th. This is the fourth reduction since price stabilization, averaging a further reduction of one-half compared to the third interest rate reduction on May 1st, excluding current deposits. Specifically: current deposit monthly interest rates range from 0.3% to 0.9%; fixed deposit monthly interest rates for half a month range from 0.9% to 1.4%, and for one month, from 1% to 1.5%; loan monthly interest rates for a fixed term of one month range from 1.8% to 3%, and for three months, from 2.1% to 3.6%. Interest rates for other currency savings and principal-protected savings are also reduced accordingly.

　　Additionally: In view of the frequent material exchange between Beijing and Tianjin, to facilitate the transfer of public and private funds, the bank will reduce the original Beijing-Tianjin exchange rate by one-half starting from the 15th, with telegraphic transfers reduced to 0.05%, draft transfers to 0.04%, and mail transfers to 0.025%.

　　Regarding the bank's minimum collection fee, the original regulation was to charge as 1,000 yuan for amounts less than 1,000 yuan. Now, to accommodate small remittances, the regulation has been changed to charge based on the actual remittance amount, rounding to the nearest yuan for amounts under 100 yuan.

　　再次降低存放款利率
    【京市新闻处讯】中国人民银行北京分行十五日再度降低存放款利率。这是物价平稳以来第四次降低，除活期存款外，比五月一日第三次降低利率后又平均降低了二分之一。计：活期存款月息由三厘至九厘；定期存款半月者月息九厘至一分四厘、一月者月息一分至一分五厘；放款定期一月者月息一分八厘至三分、三月者月息二分一厘至三分六厘，其他货币储蓄及保本保值储蓄利率也同时比照降低。
    又：该行鉴于北京、天津间物资交流频繁为便利公私款项调拨，将原定京津汇率自十五日起降低二分之一，电汇改为千分之零点五，票汇千分之零点四，信汇千分之零点二五。
    该行汇费起收办法，原定为不满千元的照千元收费，现为照顾小额汇款，改定照汇款实收，百元以下四舍五入。
