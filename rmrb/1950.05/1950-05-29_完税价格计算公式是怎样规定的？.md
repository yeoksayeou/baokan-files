To the Editor:

The Provisional Regulations on Commodity Tax passed at the 17th Administrative Council meeting of the Government Administration Council stipulate the following formula for calculating the dutiable value in Article 6:

Average market wholesale price ÷ (1 + tax rate) = dutiable value

I feel that calculating according to this formula will narrow the difference between various tax items. However, the Government Administration Council must have sufficient reason for making this provision. I hope you can explain it.

Comrade Ma An:

The following is the answer to your question from the Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government:

The collection of commodity tax is based on ad valorem taxation. However, the production and sales situation of taxable goods is complex, and manufacturers rarely use list prices. Therefore, the actual price is difficult to ascertain. In order to facilitate collection and take both public and private interests into account, the "dutiable value" is calculated according to the average market wholesale price using a formula. However, the market wholesale price already includes taxes, and the principle is "taxing everything but the tax itself". Therefore, the tax portion included must be removed through a calculation formula, and then the "tax payable" is calculated according to the statutory tax rate.

The dutiable value calculation formula passed by the Government Administration Council is derived as follows:

Average market wholesale price = dutiable value + tax payable
Tax payable = dutiable value × tax rate
Average market wholesale price = dutiable value + dutiable value × tax rate
　　　　　　　　　　　　= dutiable value × (1 + tax rate)
Therefore, the formula for calculating dutiable value is:

Average market wholesale price ÷ (1 + tax rate) = dutiable value
Dutiable value × tax rate = tax payable

### 完税价格计算公式是怎样规定的？

　　完税价格计算公式是怎样规定的？编辑同志：
    政务院第十七次政务会议上通过的货物税暂行条例第六条中，关于完税价格的计算公式是：
    市场平均批价÷（１＋税率）＝完税价格
    我觉得若按这个公式计算，会缩小各种不同税目间的差额。但是，政务院这样规定，一定有充分的道理。希望你们给解释一下。
                    石家庄市财委会金贸合组  马安马安同志：
    你的问题，已由中央人民政府财政部税务总局解答如下：
    货物税的征收，系从价核税。但课税货品之制销情形复杂，厂商很少采用牌价。因之实际价格难于查考。为了便利征收及公私兼顾起见，故按市场平均批价依照公式计算“完税价格”。但市场批价中已含有税款，“税不征税”是一个原则。所以要通过计算公式将所含税款部分剔除，然后再按法定税率计算“应纳税额”。
    政务院通过的完税价格计算公式是这样得来的：
    市场平均批价＝完税价格＋应纳税额
    应纳税额＝完税价格×税率
    市场平均批价＝完税价格＋完税价格×税率
                ＝完税价格×（１＋税率）
    故计算完税价格之公式为：
    市场平均批价÷（１＋税率）＝完税价格
    完税价格×税率＝应纳税额
