　　Public Grain Road
    Ding Ye
    The rooster crows,
    It's not early,
    A commotion in Little Nao Gully;
    Impatient young men can't sleep,
    Throw on their old sheepskin coats and run outside,
    Without bothering to button up, they hitch the cart:
    "Going on the mountain road,
    Eighty li is likely to be a hundred;
    The ridge is slippery, the cart is heavy, and there's a blizzard; (Note 1)
    The road is long, the slope is steep, the cart must start early,
    If we fall behind everyone else in delivering public grain,
    People will laugh at us, and we'll be ashamed!"
    The cart is loaded heavier than ever before,
    People get up earlier than ever before,
    The mules are fed more than ever before,
    The harvest is better than any year before!
    They never used to whip the animals,
    Secretly afraid of tiring them out,
    Openly saying they didn't want to waste the whip;
    But this time it's delivering public grain!
    Can't worry about so much:
    The whip snaps constantly on the animals' backs,
    Nobody's a fool,
    Who doesn't want to be in the lead when delivering public grain?
    The uphill road is long,
    The downhill road is short,
    The mountain climbs higher and higher,
    The whip cracks and echoes through the mountains.
    People sweat,
    The horses look like they've been bathed,
    The sticks and poles are tougher than the cart harnesses,
    The animals are pulling until their bellies are almost touching the ground!
    More and more carts join the procession,
    The carts from Da Nao Gully,
    Closely follow the carts from Xiao Nao Gully.
    The carts behind can't see the carts in front,
    The carts in front can't hear the carts behind,
    Blizzards all around,
    A lively scene,
    But visibility is low!
    To cross the ridge,
    First, announce your presence with the whip,
    Drivers on the other side of the ridge, listen up:
    "Whether you're hauling a heavy load,
    Or an empty cart;
    Whether you have many carts,
    Or just a few;
    We are public grain carts from the mountains,
    Quickly clear the public grain road!"
    The carts and horses on the other side also respond with whips:
    Returning public grain carts responding,
    Finished delivering public grain and heading back,
    The carts are loaded with new farm tools;
    All because the public grain was delivered early,
    Hearing the public grain carts coming down from the mountains,
    They rein in their horses and stop to make way.
    The Nao Gully carts and horses don't delay,
    Animals raised in the mountain valleys aren't afraid of heights,
    Crossing ridges and slopes is commonplace,
    A quick whip and they rush to the top of the ridge.
    "Kuangdong Ridge" is hard to cross,
    Carts used to break their harnesses often;
    Overturning and injuring people was common,
    "Devil's Peak" was its nickname.
    Cart drivers (Note 2) would go to the temple before crossing,
    Burning incense, paper, and candles every time,
    But rollovers and injuries were still frequent!
    Since liberation,
    The ridge tunnel has been repaired,
    The mountain god temple was torn down,
    Bricks and tiles leveled the road,
    Now we cross the ridge whenever we need to,
    There are no old superstitions anymore.
    After climbing over the ridge,
    It's all downhill,
    Use the pole horse,
    Not the inside or outside horses,
    The big cart is always running ahead of the animals,
    The north wind and blizzard,
    Are long gone, left behind on the other side of the ridge.
    The plains ahead seem closer and closer,
    The heavy snow has already turned the grain cart track into a smooth road.
    A hundred li is nothing in the sun,
    Twenty li is nothing when the sun sets;
    Whip circles three times in the air,
    The animals prick up their ears,
    The carts behind complain that the carts in front are slow,
    The carts in front laugh that the carts behind are carrying less,
    Talking and laughing, it's just twenty li;
    The tall mountain ridges are left behind!
    The lead cart has already been snatched by another village,
    The Nao Gully carts squeeze in halfway.
    Big carts love traveling in winter,
    Cart drivers love humming hometown tunes:
    "Green in March,
    Red in September,
    I plant sorghum in the high mountains.
    Born of mountain soil,
    Grown with mountain water,
    Mountain grains are fragrant against the wind,
    Mountainsides and watersides are all farmland,
    Mountains and waters deliver public grain..."
    One person hums and another's throat starts to itch:
    Remembering the puppet Manchukuo and the Kuomintang,
    Big and Small Nao Gully suffered famine every year,
    The harvested grain went into the landlords' granaries.
    The Communist Party came to the high mountains,
    Small Nao Gully has a bumper harvest every year,
    One bumper harvest leads to another in Da Nao Gully,
    One autumn's grain is worth three autumns,
    Grain exchanged for warm cloth,
    Eating well, dressing warmly, delivering public grain.
    Ten or twenty li isn't enough time to sing,
    One village is stronger than the last;
    "Sanjiazi" is more than three hundred families,
    "Wujianfang" has long become a big village,
    "Da Pian Ridge" doesn't look like a ridge,
    Cars have long flattened it!
    At noon,
    The village shop signs are hung high,
    The animals run to the shop without being driven, the shop is full of public grain carts,
    People have a quick meal and the horses are well-fed,
    Still early when they leave the shop.
    The weather on the plains is warmer than in the mountains,
    Everyone says the ice on the San Dao River is thin,
    It can't hold up several thousand pounds of grain carts,
    The drivers are all worried;
    Delivering public grain is a major national affair,
    The local government has long been prepared for this,
    Building sorghum bridges to cross the river,
    Protecting their own country.
    The sun sets slowly on the plains!
    Carts race happily on the smooth roads,
    Looking ahead, something is blocking the public grain carts,
    Up close, it turns out to be grain mountains.
    Whose grain mountains are so big?
    Whose grain mountains are so high?
    Who plants these large grain mountains!
    What do these tall grain mountains protect?
    The country's grain mountains are so big;
    The people's grain mountains are so high;
    Farmers plant these large grain mountains;
    These tall grain mountains protect the country.
    Soldiers guard these grain mountains,
    Defending the homeland;
    Workers eat from these grain mountains,
    Improving tools and increasing production;
    These grain mountains grow taller every year,
    Never running out for thousands of years!
    The grain carts enter the public grain depot,
    Inspecting on this side, weighing on the other (Note 3)
    Grabbing a handful to examine closely,
    The beans and sorghum are plump,
    Grain carts from every village arrive early,
    This year's situation is better than last year,
    The best public grain award goes to Big and Small Nao Gully,
    A red flag is planted on the cart,
    The government rewards them with new farm tools,
    Not worrying about next year's prospects.
    Unloading the public grain doesn't lighten the carts,
    The carts are loaded with New Year's goods,
    The years after liberation can't compare!
    The Nao Gully people never return from the city with empty carts.

                                   Winter, 1949, in Northeast China.
    Note 1: Old blizzard - a metaphor for heavy snow.
    Note 2: Carters - a common name for the people driving the carts.
    Note 3: Weighing - Meaning using the scale to evaluate the weight.

　　公粮道
    丁耶
    鸡一叫，
    天不早，
    小闹沟一阵闹；
    急性小伙子睡不着觉，
    披上老羊皮袄往外跑，
    没顾得上扣扣子就把车套：
    “走山道，
    说八十准有一百冒，
    岭滑，车沉，还刮老烟炮；（注一）
    路远，坡陡，车要早上道，
    送公粮要落在大家屁股后，
    人家不笑咱，咱也怪害臊！”
    车装的比哪回都沉，
    人起的比哪回都早，
    骡子喂的比哪回都饱，
    收成比哪年啊都好！
    牲口哪回也舍不得用鞭子抽，
    暗是怕累着牲口，
    明面说怕费鞭梢；
    这回是送公粮啊！
    可顾不得那么多了：
    鞭子老在牲口背上跳，
    哪个也不是傻小子，
    送公粮谁不想争个头车跑？
    上坡道长，
    下坡道少，
    山越爬越高，
    鞭子抽的满山叫。
    人冒汗，
    马像洗过澡，
    棍子棒子都硬过牲口套，
    牲口拉的肚皮快贴到地皮上了！
    车越赶越多了，
    大闹沟的车，
    紧跟着小闹沟车的屁股后跑。
    后车看不清前车影，
    前车听不清后车叫，
    前前后后都是老烟炮，
    前前后后真热闹，
    就是看不到！
    要过岭，
    先用鞭子叫，
    岭那边的车马你听着：
    “不管你重车跑，
    还是空车跑；
    不管你车多，
    还是车少；
    我们是山里来的公粮车，
    快快闪开公粮道！”
    岭那边的车马也用鞭子往回叫：
    回的也是公粮车公粮号，
    送完公粮往回跑，
    车上拉满新农具；
    都是因为公粮送的早，
    听说山里下来的公粮车，
    勒马停车来让道。
    闹沟车马闻听不待慢，
    山沟里养的牲口不怕山高，
    过岭走坡本是家常道，
    鞭子一绕就往岭顶跑。
    “矿洞岭”不好走，
    从前走车常断套；
    翻车伤人家常事，
    “鬼见愁”是它的老外号。
    车伙（注二）上岭先上庙，
    香纸腊供回回烧，
    翻车伤人并不少！
    从打解放了，
    岭洞就修好，
    拆了山神庙，
    砖头瓦块垫平道，
    如今晚过岭就过岭，
    早就没有旧说道。
    爬过岭，
    一色是下坡道，
    使辕马，
    不使里外套，
    大车老往牲口前头跑，
    北风老烟炮，
    早就扔在岭的后边了。
    前头平原越望越远了，
    大雪瓮早就叫粮车跑成响平道。
    百里不怕太阳出，
    二十里不怕太阳落；
    鞭子半空绕三绕，
    牲口耳朵竖多高，
    后车老说前车跑的慢，
    前车老笑后车装的少，
    说说笑笑就是二十里；
    高山老岭朝后跑！
    头车早就叫别村抢，
    闹沟的车马插在人家半当腰。
    大车爱走冬天道，
    车伙爱哼家乡调：
    “三月里呀青，
    九月里呀红，
    我在高山种高粱。
    山里土生，
    山里水长，
    山里的五谷顶风香，
    山上水边都是庄稼地呀，
    山山水水送公粮……”
    一个哼来别个嗓子也发痒：
    提起伪满国民党，
    大小闹沟年年闹灾荒，
    打下的粮食送进地主仓。
    高山上来了共产党，
    小闹沟年年闹丰收，
    一闹闹到大闹沟，
    一秋粮食顶三秋，
    粮换布啊暖洋洋，
    吃饱穿暖送公粮。
    十里二十里不够唱，
    一庄又比一庄强；
    “三家子”何止三百家，
    “五间房”早成了大村庄，
    “大偏岭”不像个岭，
    早叫汽车给跑平！
    到晌午，
    村里店幌挂的高，
    牲口不用人赶就往店里跑，店里停满公粮车，
    人打好尖马喂好料，
    跟出店门天还早。
    平原天气比山里暖，
    都说三道河子结冰薄，
    几千斤粮车架不住，
    赶车的个个发了毛；
    送公粮本是天下大事，
    当地政府早就防备这一遭，
    秫秸搭桥高粱过河，
    自个家江山自家保。
    平原上日头落的慢呦！
    响道上跑车赶的欢，
    远看前边什么挡住公粮车，
    近看原来是粮山。
    谁家的粮山这么大？
    谁家的粮山这么高？
    这么大的粮山什么人种！
    这么高的粮山把啥保？
    国家的粮山这么大；
    老百姓的粮山这么高；
    这么大的粮山庄稼人种；
    这么高的粮山要把国保。
    战士圪了这一座座粮山，
    捍卫祖国保家园；
    工人吃了这一座座粮山，
    改良工具提高生产；
    这座座粮山年年高，
    千年万年吃不完！
    粮车进了公粮栈，
    这边检查那边上秤约（注三）
    抓了一把仔细瞅，
    豆子高粱粒粒饱，
    村村粮车都到的早，
    今年光景都比去年好，
    上等公粮评上了大小闹沟，
    红旗插在车上头，
    政府奖给新农具，
    明年的光景更不愁。
    卸下公粮车不减轻，
    车上装的是年货，
    翻身的年月不能比呀！
    闹沟人进城从不往回跑空车。
                                   一九四九，冬，于东北。
    注一：老烟炮——喻大风雪。
    注二：车伙——赶车的人的俗称。
    注三：上秤约——用秤评斤两的意思。
