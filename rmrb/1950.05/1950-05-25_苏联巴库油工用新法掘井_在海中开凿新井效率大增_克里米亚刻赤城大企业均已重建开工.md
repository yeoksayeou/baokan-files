　　Xinhua News Agency, Baku, 20th: Metal islands with oil derricks rising from the Caspian Sea are appearing more and more on the sea surface month after month. Whether in calm seas and boundless blue skies, or in raging storms, the oil workers are constantly working, drilling new oil wells in the sea. Recently, Stalin Prize winner and famous Baku oil worker Neimatulla has begun to apply the accelerated drilling method, which has been very effective on land, to the sea. In the first few weeks, his team has been able to increase the standard rate by two times. Neimatulla's team has already completed ten months of its quota and has guaranteed to complete the annual plan ahead of schedule.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd: The working people of Kerch, Crimea, Soviet Union, were deeply inspired in the past by Stalin's call for the people to restore the economy destroyed by the fascist aggressors more quickly. In the past six years, they have completed a great deal of work. Major enterprises have been rebuilt and have all started production. Last year, the city's local industry and cooperative industry's production volume basically exceeded the pre-war level.
　　While developing industry, the construction of apartment buildings, as well as buildings for cultural and educational institutions and public utilities, is being accelerated in the city. Twenty-four schools have been opened, with a total of 11,000 students, as well as 48 medical institutions, 21 libraries, and five clubs and cultural centers. Many apartment buildings have been built, with a total area of 300,000 square meters. Thanks to the active participation of the people, the city has been quickly rebuilt. The main water pipe has been completely repaired, and the water supply has reached the pre-war level.
　　The annual increase in budget funds also proves the development of industry and the entire city. In 1945, the budget was 12.5 million rubles, and this year it has increased to 25 million rubles. Ninety percent of the budget funds are used for public health, education, and public utilities. The working people of Kerch have resolved to accelerate the restoration of their city and to build it even better than before the war.

　　苏联巴库油工用新法掘井在海中开凿新井效率大增 
    克里米亚刻赤城大企业均已重建开工
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴库二十日电：里海上取油起重机耸立的金属小岛，月复一月越来越多地出现在海面上了。不论在风平浪静，蔚蓝色的天空一望无际的时候，或是狂风怒吼的时候，油工们都从不停歇地在劳动，在海中开凿新油井。最近，斯大林奖金获奖者、巴库著名采油工人聂依马杜拉已开始在海中应用在陆地著有成效的加速掘井法。在最初几个星期内，他这一队已能提高标准速率两倍。聂依马杜拉队已经完成了十个月的定额，并且已保证提前完成一年计划。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十二日电：苏联克里米亚刻赤城的劳动人民，过去因为斯大林号召人民更快地恢复被法西斯侵略者破坏了的经济而深受感召，在过去六年间，已完成了许多工作。大企业都已重建起来，并已全部开工生产。去年该城的地方工业和合作社工业的生产量，基本上已经超过了战前水平。
    一方面发展工业，一方面加速进行修建该城公寓房屋，以及文化教育机关和公用事业机关的建筑物。开办了二十四所学校，共有学生一万一千人，以及四十八所医务机关、二十一个图书馆，和五个俱乐部与文化馆。已经修建了许多公寓房屋，面积共有三十万方公尺。由于人民积极参加，已把城市迅速重建起来了。自来水总管已完全修复，给水量已达到战前水平。
    预算经费逐年增加，这一点也证明了工业和整个城市的发展。一九四五年，预算经费是一千二百五十万卢布，今年已增加到二千五百万卢布。预算经费中的百分之九十都是用在公共卫生、教育和公用事业方面。刻赤城的劳动人民已下定决心要加速恢复他们的城市，并且要把它建设得比战前更美好。
