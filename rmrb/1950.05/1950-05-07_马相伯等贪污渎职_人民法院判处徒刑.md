Ma Xiangbo was sentenced to seven years imprisonment, Xia Jingui was sentenced to six years imprisonment, Qi Shouyao was sentenced to six years imprisonment, Wang Chong and Chen Jiahui were each sentenced to three years imprisonment.
    Ma Xiangbo was sent by the Municipal People's Government Health Bureau (now the Public Health Bureau) to the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital in September 1949 as a military control liaison officer and deputy director. After taking office, he lived a corrupt life and often used his power to embezzle public property. As of January 5 this year, he successively obtained 779 injections of morphine and other needles, 20 morphine tablets, 650 opium-containing anti-smoking pills, and various other drugs from the hospital's pharmacy, with a current value equivalent to 5,313 jin of Fudi millet. Ma committed the crime of injecting ten doses of morphine and other drugs daily, and often used his power to order the hospital's clerks to use public funds to purchase furniture, tobacco, alcohol and other daily necessities. By the time of his dismissal, he had used a total of 951,175 yuan in public funds.
    Xia Jingui served as the chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the Eighth District Office after the liberation of Beijing. During his tenure, his life became increasingly corrupt. He became acquainted with opium and drug offenders such as Wang Shou Ting and smoked opium, heroin and other drugs, eventually leading to the use of his power to steal and sell 973 jin of public grain (relief grain) and embezzling 1.4 million yuan in public funds such as military dependents' production funds; He defrauded 1.165 million yuan in RMB from 27 merchants and residents under false pretenses.
    Qi Shouyao served as a probationary judge of the Beijing People's Court since August 1949. During his tenure, he used his power to transfer case files without authorization, leaked secrets, and extorted litigants six times, accepting bribes totaling more than 640,000 yuan in RMB, 15 silver dollars, and a box of food. In addition, he had repeatedly violated laws and neglected his duties, intending to take bribes but failing.
    Wang Chong served as the deputy chief of the Administrative Section of the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau after the liberation of Beijing. During his tenure, he was lazy in his work and lived a decadent and corrupt life. He used various methods to embezzle a total of 461,310 yuan in RMB; and since April 1949, he has frequently patronized prostitutes, and has not repented despite repeated criticism and education.
    Chen Jiahui had long been infected with the evils of the old society during the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang. Since April 1949, he has served as a clerk in the Inspection Section of the Beijing Taxation Bureau. In March of this year, he extorted 100,000 yuan in RMB from the Beijing Brothers Dairy Factory in the name of investigating tax evasion.
    After the five criminals, including Ma, were sent to the Beijing People's Court for trial, the court imposed severe sentences of imprisonment on them separately for their serious violations of laws and disciplines. Among them, Qi Shouyao, as a judicial worker, should have been severely punished for knowingly violating the law, but the offender had a preliminary understanding during the trial and confessed his crimes, so he was leniently sentenced to six years in prison.
