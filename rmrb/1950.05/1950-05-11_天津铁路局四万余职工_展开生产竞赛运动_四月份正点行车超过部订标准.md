　　Over 40,000 Employees of Tianjin Railway Bureau
	Launch Production Emulation Drive
		April On-Time Train Operation Exceeds Ministry Standards
    [Our Dispatch] The Tianjin Railway Bureau launched a production emulation drive on "May Day." According to the Bureau's instructions, all units across the railway began preparations for the "May Day" grand competition in early April. From April 27th to 29th, a conference of employee representatives from across the railway was held to repeatedly discuss the creation of new record standards, bonus payments for exceeding quotas, and leadership issues. All units formulated draft production standards and bonus methods, mobilizing 45,000 employees across the railway to participate in the movement to create new records. Prior to this movement, due to improvements in working methods and labor organization, and the utilization of existing technical equipment, several units had achieved great success in improving work efficiency. For example, in the 500-kilometer locomotive movement, as of May 1st, seven locomotives had consecutively achieved this across the railway. In addition to Locomotive No. 1952 in Dezhou, the originator of the 500-kilometer run, Locomotives No. 1612 in Guye, No. 1928 in Zhangjiakou, No. 1781 in Fengtai, No. 1804 in Qinhuangdao, No. 1819 in Tianjin, and No. 1723 in Cangxian have all succeeded. This is the result of mutual assurance and meticulous work by locomotive dispatchers and locomotive crew teams. The on-time train operation movement, which began on April 1st, has achieved great success. As of the 20th, the average on-time departure of passenger trains was 99.8 percent, and arrival was 95 percent. From the 21st onwards, only two days saw 98 percent on-time departures, with all other days at 100 percent, and arrivals were also above 90 percent. The on-time departure of freight trains also reached 100 percent in some cases, and arrivals were all above 85 percent. All of these exceeded the ministry-set standards and the bureau's determined goals. In terms of safe locomotive operation, Locomotives No. 602 and No. 1519 in the Tianjin Section, and No. 1814 in Guye, have all completed 100,000 kilometers. The Tianjin Train Depot's 500,000-kilometer accident-free movement was also successfully completed the day before "May Day."
    All districts and units across the railway have formulated new operating standards based on their existing work, and have comprehensively launched friendly challenge competitions.

    全路各地区各单位，已在现有工作基础上，制订了新的作业标准，全面展开了友谊挑战竞赛。
