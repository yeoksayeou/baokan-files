　　Tenth Reading Room Opens
    [Our Newspaper] To help workers, farmers, and citizens study, the municipal government has established the Tenth Reading Room in Zhengdian Town, the central area of the Sixteenth District. The address is temporarily located at 15 South Street. It officially opened for reading on the 13th. From the 12th to the 14th, a photo exhibition of the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held. Before the opening of the room, a forum was held on the 12th to solicit opinions from all walks of life in order to run the reading room well. The film "White-Clad Soldiers" was shown that evening.
