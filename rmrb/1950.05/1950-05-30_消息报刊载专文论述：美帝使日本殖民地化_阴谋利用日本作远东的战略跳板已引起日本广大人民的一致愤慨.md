    American Imperialism Colonizes Japan
    Conspiracy to Use Japan as a Strategic Springboard in the Far East Arouses Unanimous Indignation Among the Broad Masses of the Japanese People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th] TASS reports from Moscow: *Izvestia* published a special article on the 26th by Professor Konstantin Popov titled "American Colonization of Japan." The author first pointed out that a series of plans unilaterally implemented by the United States in Japan for its own purposes have created many favorable conditions for American monopoly capitalists. The Japanese government has abolished all laws that might hinder the further expansion of American capital. Now, American capital has invaded Japanese enterprises in the electrical industry, petroleum industry, chemical industry, iron and non-ferrous metal production, machinery manufacturing, and railway transportation. American businessmen have successfully bought up all the stocks of many Japanese enterprises and companies. At the beginning of 1950, the total amount of American investment in Japan had reached more than 2.5 billion US dollars.
    The author continued: The United States has turned the issue of reparations into a way to colonize Japan. The United States superficially announced the abolition of reparations, putting on the appearance of a "benefactor," but in reality, it is carrying out so-called "secret reparations," that is, seizing Japan's most valuable patents and technical secrets, especially in the production of strategic materials. After plundering Japan's gold reserves, the United States used them arbitrarily and, in violation of the Far Eastern Commission's decision, even extracted 40 tons of gold from Japan's gold reserves and handed it over to the Thai and Vietnamese Bảo Đại puppet governments.
    The author finally pointed out: The American war instigators are attempting to use Japan as their strategic springboard in the Far East. However, the American policy of abolishing Japanese national independence and the Japanese ruling class's behavior of selling out the motherland have aroused unanimous indignation among the broad masses of the Japanese people. The increasingly strengthened Japanese democratic movement, regardless of the various obstacles of the reactionaries, has gradually become a powerful force blocking American imperialism from realizing its conspiracy.

    美帝使日本殖民地化
    阴谋利用日本作远东的战略跳板已引起日本广大人民的一致愤慨
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报二十六日刊载康斯坦丁·波波夫教授以“美国使日本殖民地化”为题的专文。作者首先指出：美国为了它自己的目的而在日本片面实行的一系列计划，为美国垄断资本家创造了许多有利条件。日本政府已废止一切可能妨碍美国资本进一步扩张的法案。现在，美国资本已侵入日本的电气工业、石油工业、化学工业、铁与非铁金属生产、器械制造业以及铁路运输等企业。美国商人已顺利地把日本许多企业和公司的股票，统统收买过去。一九五○年初，美国在日本各项投资的总额，已达二十五亿美元之多。
    作者继称：美国已将赔偿问题变成使日本殖民地化的一种方式。美国表面上宣布取消赔偿，摆出“恩主”的样子，但实际上却在进行着所谓“暗中赔偿”，即攫取日本最宝贵的专利权和技术秘密，特别是在战略物资的生产方面。美国在攘夺了日本的黄金准备后，就自行任意使用，并且违反了远东委员会的决定，竟从日本黄金准备中提出了四十吨黄金，交给泰国及越南保大傀儡政府。
    作者最后指出：美国的战争挑拨者企图利用日本作为他们在远东的战略跳板。但是，美国意图取消日本民族独立的政策，及日本统治阶级出卖祖国的行为，已引起广大日本人民群众一致的愤慨。日益加强的日本民主运动，不顾反动派的种种阻挠，已经逐渐成为阻挡美帝国主义实现其阴谋的强大力量。
