　　Jinan “New China” Youth Package Crew
　　Creates Daily Mileage Record of 600 Kilometers
　　"Mao Zedong" Locomotive Sets Highest Haulage Record in Zhengzhou Railway Bureau

　　[This Dispatch from Jinan] The Jinan Locomotive Depot’s Door-Kappa (冂ㄎ)—11681 “New China” Youth Package Crew, on April 26th, in the turnaround from Jinan to Yanzhou, from Yanzhou to Dezhou, and from Dezhou back to Jinan, created a new record of 626.1 kilometers of daily mileage, a technical speed of 39.8 kilometers per hour, and a travel speed of 32.2 kilometers per hour. Since the group signed a technical education contract in April, the technical level and work enthusiasm of the train crew members have greatly improved. After the locomotive’s Class C inspection this time, before igniting the engine on the 26th of last month, they held a meeting to discuss and made all preparations for running the mileage, and formulated a work plan and handover methods. Before starting the engine, they first prepared the firebed well. During operation, they took advantage of passing sidings to carry out maintenance work, in order to shorten the stopover time at outer stations. At the same time, they maintained close contact with the dispatching office and made preparations according to the dispatching instructions. Because the station operation time was shortened and the operation time was relatively increased, a new record of daily mileage was created.

    [Dispatch] The national locomotive banner “Mao Zedong” Locomotive has created an unprecedented record for haulage tonnage on the Longhai and Pinghan Railways. On April 24th, at 11:56, the locomotive hauled Train No. 663, weighing 1951 metric tons, departing Zhengzhou Station on time. At 16:36, it arrived safely and quickly at the terminal station, Yancheng, 33 minutes ahead of schedule. The haulage tonnage exceeded the local standard by 315 metric tons, and it ascended a gradient of 6/1000 at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour. This was due to the close cooperation between the driver and the stoker, the skilled application of the three-shovel coaling method, and the saving of 4,573 kilograms of coal. All of these broke the new records in the history of the Longping Railway. The Locomotive Depot Chief Liu Xing and others said in a letter of congratulations to the "Mao Zedong" Package Crew: "Your success in exceeding the haulage tonnage this time has created the highest record for locomotive tractive force in Zhengzhou and has opened up a path for improving locomotive tractive force." He also called on all package crews in the depot to earnestly and actively learn from the "Mao Zedong" Locomotive, strengthen the maintenance of locomotives, improve the quality of locomotives, improve operating technology, implement the responsibility system, and advance on the road of the "Mao Zedong" Package Crew.

　　济南“新中国号”青年包乘组
    创日车六百公里纪录 
    “毛泽东号”创郑州局最高牵引纪录
    【本报济南讯】济南机务段冂ㄎ—一六八一新中国号青年包乘组，于上月二十六日在由济南到兗州，由兗州到德县，由德县返济南的周转中，创日车公里六二六·一公里，技术速度三九·八公里，旅行速度三二·二公里的新纪录。该组自四月份订技术教育合同后，乘务员的技术水平与工作积极性大为提高。这次机车丙检后，于上月二十六号点火前就开会讨论，作了跑公里的一切准备工作，并订出了工作计划与交接班的办法。在开车前先整好火床，运转中就利用错车时，进行整理工作，以缩短外站停留时间；同时并与调度所密切联系，根据调度指示作好准备工作。由于停站作业时间缩短，运转时间相对增加，因此创造了日车公里的新纪录。

    【本报讯】全国机车旗帜“毛泽东号”，牵引吨数创陇（海）、平（汉）铁路空前纪录。该机车于四月二十四日十一时五十六分牵引“六六三”次列车，重一九五一公吨，从郑州站正点开出，于十六时三十六分安全迅速到达终着站郾城，较规定时间提前三十三分，牵引吨数超过局部标准三一五公吨，并以每时十九公里的速度，上千分之六斜度的坡道，由于该车司机和司炉取得密切联系，及三锹制焚火法运用得熟练，并节省煤四千五百七十三公斤，所有这些都打破了陇平铁路有史以来的新纪录。机务段长刘星等给“毛泽东号”包乘组的慰问信说：“你们这次超越牵引吨数的成功，创造了郑州机车牵引力的最高纪录，给提高机车牵引力的工作开辟了道路。”并号召全段所有包乘组认真积极向“毛泽东号”学习，加强对机车的保养，提高机车质量，提高操纵技术贯彻负责制，向“毛泽东号”包乘组的道路前进。
