　　"Magnesia Brick Copper Smelting Furnace"
    --The Birth and Growth of a New Creation
    Hua Shan
    I. Breaking the Japanese Convention of "Fifteen Hundred Years of Accumulated Effort"
    During my two-week visit to the Shenyang Smelting Plant in the Red May, I have been inspired by a series of production success reports: The current efficiency of copper electrolysis increased from 93% to 96% in one week, exceeding the American technical standard (90% to 95%), and the production rate of electrolytic copper thus exceeded one and a half times that of the Puppet Manchukuo period; a technician with only half a year of seniority, just extracted a metal "bismuth" with a small output and great use in the world on "May Day", and then solved the technical difficulties of mass production ten days later; the copper removal agent "zinc powder", which is indispensable for electrolysis operations, has never been able to be manufactured in China, and now the experiment has also been successful. What is particularly exciting is that the magnesia brick copper smelting furnace, which has been born for less than half a year, has also overcome the difficulties that could not be broken through for a month at this time.
    This new furnace, jointly created by veteran workers and new technicians, doubled the copper smelting output as soon as it appeared, overwhelming the "Shin Chu furnace," which has always been known as "the crystallization of fifteen hundred years of hard work in the Japanese copper smelting industry." However, for more than a month, because the copper ore contained too much iron, the furnace bricks were covered with iron, which became thicker and thicker and could not be removed. The capacity of some furnaces has been reduced by four-fifths. This problem is exactly what the "Shin Chu furnace" does not have.
    "Are we going back to the old days of Japanese mud furnaces?" From the factory director to the furnace workers, everyone was anxious. It was this difficulty that tested the life and death of the magnesia brick furnace that was completely solved on the first weekend night of Red May.
    Half a year ago, the smelting plant was still famous for "the highest chimney, the worst production" and could not complete the task: five days of operation, three days of shutdown; one type of accident could occur seventeen times repeatedly. The porters even secretly took off the "Shenye" badges when they went to the railway station, for fear of losing face.
    If you ask the workers casually: "How has your production changed?" They always like to say: "When technicians and workers are combined, the energy comes."
    Since the factory put forward the management policy of "going deep into the site and solving problems" in November last year, more than 50 major technical reforms jointly completed by technicians and workers have appeared in the factory, creating a new record of completing half a year's production plan before "May Day." The creation of the magnesia brick furnace is a vivid example of the combination of technology and labor in the smelting plant.
    II. Small Mud Furnaces Under Big Chimneys
    In April last year, Chen Lian'gao, a middle-aged worker who had been a furnace worker in the "Shin Chu furnace" for seven years, proposed a suggestion to the smelting department: to change the mud furnace for refining crude copper into a magnesia brick furnace. However, the technicians thought that this was impossible.
    "It's really messing around," the engineer said, "Japan is the ancestor of the Shin Chu furnace, and it is still made of mud! This is the crystallization of evolution and development over fifteen hundred years, and I don't know how much effort experts of all dynasties have spent. If magnesia bricks could be used, would you still need to say it!"
    The Shin Chu furnace does have its own advantages: the furnace wall is made of yellow mud and gold and silver ore. The iron in the copper ore melt comes into contact with the gold and silver ore and becomes a kind of slag called iron silicate, which floats on the copper and separates from the copper. This is called "natural slag making," and no additional ingredients are needed to eliminate iron.
    But the problem also lies here: the furnace wall is constantly turning into slag. If it becomes thinner, you have to quickly add mud cakes to the furnace to make up for it, thinning inside and thickening outside. After smelting for a day or two, the furnace belly will be half as big, maybe it has been patched into the shape of a crooked duck egg, and it often collapses as a whole, making the slag in the furnace more than copper. Even if it does not collapse, the furnace belly will be so big that the furnace base cannot hold it. The furnace must be dismantled and rebuilt after smelting one or two furnaces. How troublesome!
    There is also a problem: the copper contains lead, which must be heated and blown to turn the lead into gas (lead oxide) to blow it off. However, the mud furnace is not strong and cannot increase the wind. Lead oxide cannot be blown off completely for a while, so it rolls up and down in the copper solution. Once it touches the coke powder at the bottom of the furnace, the oxygen is taken away by the coke powder and becomes the original lead again. This has to be oxidized again with heat and wind. It changes back and forth like this, and it can't be removed for a long time. The most annoying thing is that lead is heavier than copper, so it often sinks and does not come out, and sometimes it drills through the bottom of the furnace, which is very dangerous.
    Laborious, low output, and unable to smelt "difficult ore" with high lead content. - This is the weakness of the Shin Chu furnace that cannot be overcome. Therefore, Japan began to use the world's common new converter 33 years ago. However, when the Japanese invaders built this smelting plant 13 years ago, they still used mud furnaces. The enemy consumed labor, so they built a prison outside the factory, and drove the Chinese people in to work in the factory every day. The Shin Chu furnace could not smelt "difficult ore," so the enemy only selected good ore to mine, digging holes here and there, destroying the good mine. In Shenyang, where factories stand in great numbers, the highest chimney is the smelting plant. You would never think that under this giant chimney, there is a row of mud furnaces like small graves. From these small mud furnaces under the big chimney, you can see how clumsy the colonial industry that plundered Chinese resources and manpower was. The more furnace worker Chen Lian'gao looked at it, the more unpleasant it became, and he wanted to transform the mud furnace after liberation.
    "After turning over, we must have the energy to turn over." He thought. Once, he suddenly saw that the front bed of the copper blast furnace was made of magnesia bricks, and he wondered if he could use magnesia bricks to build a furnace? Whenever he repaired the mud furnace, he secretly added a few magnesia bricks to the furnace wall and took them down to see after the copper was smelted. After four consecutive tests, the magnesia bricks were still fine. With confidence, he proposed it to his superiors.
    III. What Buried the Creativity of Labor?
    The original technicians of the smelting plant, like other newly liberated factories, had always looked down on the workers. Some technicians said: "If you don't know how to read, you will die of exhaustion. What do you know?" For Chen Lian'gao's suggestion, they said no to ten things: "North Korea has already experimented with it, but copper can't be smelted." "Japanese technology is so high, but it is still mud!" Chen Lian'gao refused to accept it and said: "Japan has not turned over, so how can we turn over? If they can't do it, can we guarantee that we can't do it?" The factory director was an old liberated area cadre, so he asked to report his opinion.
    At that time, the factory's production only completed 77% of the task for four consecutive months. The Northeast Ministry of Industry and the factory director were very anxious, because copper is very important for the military industry and electrical equipment industry. However, there were different opinions on how to improve production. The Ministry of Industry believes that the main key points in the production process, such as the power department's water, electricity, wind, and the heart department's smelting furnace, have long been inefficient. When an accident occurs, the factory director does not know, and if he knows, he does not check; even a very simple accident such as connecting the wrong current positive and negative poles can happen three times repeatedly. However, the factory director believes that "this is not a management problem but a technical problem." He only calls technicians to meetings when something happens, and he shakes his head when the technicians shake their heads. Regardless of the 48 accidents that occurred in 17 days, "it is useless to not understand technology," he would rather lock himself in the office and read technical theory books, and ignore the 200 improvement suggestions put forward by the workers. As a result, more than 300 workers were left idle and no one cared, and copper concentrate was littered everywhere, dyeing the ditch yellow.
    Chen Lian'gao's furnace construction suggestion was rejected by the factory with eight big characters: "The spirit is very good, no experiment for the time being." The reason is "the engineers all said it wouldn't work."
    Chen Lian'gao was so angry that he planned to buy magnesia bricks for experiments with his own salary, but when he inquired about the price, he would have to spend eight years' salary to buy bricks without eating. So he had to put things aside. - Bureaucratism that deviates from the masses and talks about technology in vain is what buries the creative talents of labor.

　　“镁砖炼铜炉”
    ——一个新创造的诞生与成长
    华山
    一、打破了“千五百年心血结晶”的日本陈规
    在红五月访问沈阳冶炼厂，两周来我一直被一连串的生产捷报振奋着：铜电解的电流效率，在一周间从百分之九十三提高到百分之九十六，超过了美国的技术标准（百分之九十到九十五），电解铜的生产率因而超过伪满时期一倍半；一个工龄只有半年的技术人员，刚刚在“五一”提炼出来一种在世界上产量很小、用途很大的金属“铋”，十天后又解决了大量生产的技术困难；电解作业上不可缺少的脱铜剂“锌粉”，在中国从来是无法自造的，现在，也试验成功了。特别令人兴奋的是，诞生不到半年的镁砖炼铜炉，也在这时候度过了一个月来无法突破的难关。
    这个由老工人和新技术人员共同创造的新炉，一出现便把炼铜产量提高一倍，压倒了向来被称为“日本冶铜界一千五百年来心血结晶”的“真吹炉”。可是一个多月以来，由于铜矿里的铁质太多，炉砖便沾满了铁，越沾越厚，无法清除，有的炉子的容量已经缩小了五分之四了。这个毛病恰恰是“真吹炉”所没有的。
    “又要回到日本泥炉的老日子去吗？”从厂长到炉工都着急起来。正是这种考验着镁砖炉生死存废的困难，在红五月的第一个周末晚上一下子全被解决了。
    半年以前，冶炼厂还是以“烟囱最高，生产最糟”，不能完成任务出名的：五天开炉，三天停工；一种事故可以重复发生十七次。弄得搬运工人到火车站去，也要悄悄摘下“沈冶”的证章，怕丢脸。
    随便问问工人：“你们的生产是怎样转变过来的？”他们总喜欢说：“技术人员和工人一结合，劲儿就来了。”
    去年十一月冶炼厂厂方提出“深入现场，解决问题”的管理方针以后，全厂便陆续出现了五十多件由技术人员和工人共同完成的重大技术改革，创造了“五一”以前完成半年生产计划的新纪录。镁砖炉的创造，就是冶炼厂技术与劳动结合的一个生动例子。
    二、大烟囱下的小泥炉
    去年四月，在“真吹炉”做了七年炉工的中年工人陈连高，向熔炼部提出一项建议：把提炼粗铜的泥炉改成镁砖炉。但是技术人员却认为这是不可能的事情。
    “真是胡来”，工程师说，“日本是真吹炉的老祖宗，到现在还是用泥做的！这是一千五百年来演变发展的结晶，不知耗废了历代多少专家的心血。能用镁砖还待你说！”
    真吹炉的确自有妙处：炉壁是用黄泥和金银矿石糊成的。铜矿熔液里含有的铁质和金银矿石碰到一块，就变成一种叫做矽酸铁的渣子，浮在铜上，和铜分开了。这叫做“自然造渣”，不必另加配料，就能消除铁质。
    可是毛病也出在这里：炉壁不断变成渣子。薄了，得赶紧用泥饼子往炉上补，里面减薄，外面加厚。这末炼上一两天，炉肚子就大出一半，说不定已经补成个歪鸭蛋的样子，还常常整块坍下来，弄得炉里的渣子比铜还要多。即使不坍，炉肚子也要大到炉座子无法盛下，炼一两炉铜就得拆炉，重修，好麻烦！
    还有一个毛病：铜里含有铅质，得加热、加风，把铅化成气（氧化铅），才能吹掉。可是泥炉不结实，不能加大风。氧化铅一时吹不干净，便在铜溶液里滚上滚下，一碰到炉底的焦粉，就被焦粉把氧夺跑，又变成原来的铅了。这又得让热和风再氧化一次。这末变来变去，老除不干净。最讨厌的是铅比铜重，常常沉下去就不出来，有时把炉底也钻透了，非常危险。
    耗费人工，产量不大，不能炼铅质多的“难矿”。——这就是真吹炉无法克服的缺点。所以日本国内在三十三年前就开始采用世界上通用的新式转炉了。可是日寇在十三年前修建这冶炼厂时，却照旧用的泥炉子。耗费人工，敌人就在厂外修了一座监狱，把中国人抓进去，每天赶他们进厂做工。真吹炉不能炼“难矿”，敌人就净挑好矿开采，挖的这里一个洞，那里一个洞，把好好的矿山给糟塌了。在工厂林立的沈阳，那里烟囱最高那里就是冶炼厂。你绝想不到蹲在这座巨型烟囱下的，却是小坟包似的一排泥炉。光从这些大烟囱下的小泥炉，就可以看到掠夺中国资源和人力的殖民地工业是怎样蹩脚的。炉工陈连高越看越不顺眼，解放后就想改造泥炉。
    “翻了身，得有个翻身的劲头。”他想。有一次，他猛看见铜鼓风炉的前床是镁砖的，就想能不能用镁砖造炉呢？每逢修造泥炉，他便偷偷地把几块镁砖加到炉壁上，炼完铜后再拆下来看。一连试了四次，镁砖还是好好的。心里有了把握，便向上级提出来。
    三、是什么埋没了劳动创造才能？
    冶炼厂原来的技术人员，起初也和其他新解放的厂子一样，从来是瞧不起工人的。有些技术人员说：“大字不识，累死算到了头。懂啥？”陈连高一个建议，他们便十个不行：“朝鲜早试验过了，就是炼不出铜来。”“日本技术那样高还是泥的哩！”陈连高不服气地说：“日本没翻身，咱怎么就翻身了？他们干不来，就保险咱也干不好？”厂长是老解放区干部，他就要求把意见反映上去。
    当时厂里的生产，一连四个月只完成任务百分之七十七，东北工业部和厂长都很着急，因为铜对军事工业和电气设备工业都非常重要。可是，怎样才能搞好生产，意见就不同了。工业部认为：生产过程中的主要关键如像动力部门的水、电、风和心脏部门熔炼炉等，长期效率不高，出了事故厂长还不知道，知道了也不检查；甚至接错电流阴阳这样极简单的事故，也会重复发生三次。可是厂长却认为“这不是管理问题而是技术问题”。有事情只找技术人员开会，技术人员摇头，他也摇头。管他十七天发生四十八次事故，“不懂技术什么也白搭”，他宁可关在办公室里读技术理论书，对工人提出的二百条改进意见根本不去睬理。弄得三百多工人吃闲饭没人过问，遍地乱丢的铜精矿把水沟也染黄了。
    陈连高的造炉建议到了厂部，就叫八个大字批驳回来：“精神很好，暂不试验。”理由是“工程师都说不行”。
    陈连高气的不行，打算自己掏工资买镁砖来试验，可是，一打听价钱，不吃饭光买砖也得八年工资，于是只好把事情搁下来了。——脱离群众空谈技术的官僚主义，就是这样埋没了劳动创造才能的。
