　　We Can Overcome Natural Disasters
    Report to the China People's Relief Representative Conference on April 25, 1950
    Xie Juezai

Chairman, fellow representatives:

    I.

    Last year, many regions across the country experienced natural disasters, particularly the severe floods in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Shandong in East China, and Hebei and Pingyuan in North China. Although, nationwide, the affected farmland of varying degrees totaled 121.56 million mu, and the affected farmers numbered approximately 40 million, this was less than the devastating flood of 1931, where eight provinces suffered 157.85 million mu of affected farmland and 52.71 million affected farmers. However, due to the eight-year war of aggression by Japanese imperialism and the four-year anti-people war by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits supported by U.S. imperialism, which involved forcibly altering river courses, destroying embankments, burning, killing, and plundering, the people's ability to resist disasters was greatly weakened, thus exacerbating the severity of the disasters.

    As soon as the disasters began last year, governments at all levels led the people to fight against them, successively investing over 153 million jin of grain in disaster relief. Instead of simply distributing relief grain to the disaster victims indiscriminately, they were differentiated: about 20 percent of the 40 million disaster victims did not need relief, 60 percent could overcome the disasters through organized production and slight assistance, and only 20 percent, about 8 million people, were severely affected and lacked labor or sufficient labor and urgently needed relief.

    Currently, the national disaster situation has basically stopped developing, and the disaster situation in severely affected areas is gradually stabilizing. The severe spring famine has passed its worst phase. The situation of disaster relief work has been repeatedly reported in newspapers and by responsible comrades of the central government (all found in the distributed booklets). I do not want to repeat it here. Below, I will only raise a few points based on the experience of disaster relief work for discussion at the conference and request your corrections.

    II.

    The ruling classes of the old era, pressing down on the people, weakened the people's ability to resist disasters. They even directly created disasters, and then took out a tiny bit from their swollen wallets to pretend to be charitable. Although there were some kind-hearted people in the charitable organizations of the old society who wanted to do good, the force of creating disasters was greater, and the force of disaster relief was smaller, like a drop in the bucket, often to no avail. The new era—the era of the people—sees the people use their own strength to fight against natural and man-made disasters—that is, the wounds left by the overthrown ruling classes and certain disasters that are still difficult to eliminate today. The essence of disaster relief has changed, and therefore its meaning, its methods, and its effects are completely different. For example, the old society said that relief work was a "charitable undertaking," and the people being helped had to "rely" on them. However, the practical experience of the liberated areas over the years regarding agricultural loans, epidemic prevention, disaster relief, and other work has put forward that workers should oppose the view of bestowing favors, and those being helped should oppose the view of dependency. The government's money and grain are the people's money and grain, so what is there to bestow? If people help me, I also help people. I accept help temporarily so that I won't need help in the future. What is there to depend on? Facts have proved that those who can overcome the viewpoints of bestowing favors and dependency will face no insurmountable difficulties. Conversely, the work effect will be worse. The People's Government's disaster relief is based on this policy. Therefore, its methods and effects are fundamentally different from the disaster relief of the old society. The major differences are as follows:

    First, the disaster relief policies and methods must be mastered by the people, so that the power will be great. To enable the people to master disaster relief policies, the cadres at all levels must first be able to master the policies, and the senior cadres among the cadres must personally lead in-depth disaster areas. The Central People's Government successively sent five inspection teams led by Liu Jingfan, Deputy Director of the People's Supervisory Committee, and Wu Xinyu and Chen Qiyuan, Deputy Ministers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, respectively to the disaster areas of Pingyuan, Hebei, Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui. Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of Hebei Province, Han Zheyi, Deputy Chairman of Pingyuan Province, Wu Zhipu, Chairman of Henan Province, and senior responsible comrades from various provinces and regions in East China and Central South led cadres to inspect disaster areas and stayed there to guide the work. Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of Hebei Province, personally visited sixteen counties and forty-seven villages, and has now gone to northern Anhui. More than 4,000 cadres from Hebei Province went to the countryside for disaster relief. The experience and ability of cadres should be stronger than that of the general public, and senior cadres are stronger than ordinary cadres. They study problems and solve problems with the people, help production, and live together, which makes our policies of production for self-relief, social mutual assistance, work-for-relief, and necessary relief not only mastered by cadres at all levels but also by the people. Another method is through the representative conferences and people's congresses of all sectors of disaster areas, where the representatives of the disaster victims discuss and organize the people themselves. For example, in Jinxiang County, Pingyuan Province, the original mobilization of 34 percent of the masses for production increased to 71 percent of male laborers and 62 percent of female laborers after the representative conference of all sectors was held. After the representative conference of all sectors was held in Wuqing County, Hebei, it corrected the cadres' unrealistic plans and accepted the spirit of starting from small things. Experience has proved that wherever the People's Congress is held well, the disaster situation will be reversed immediately.

    In order to make disaster relief work under unified leadership, concentrate forces, and coordinate actions, production and disaster relief committees have been organized from the central government to the governments of various provinces and regions.

    Second, we do not regard disaster relief as merely "alms," but as a series of tasks to combat disasters. In the event of a spring drought, water is carried for planting. In the event of an insect plague, the masses catch and beat them. In 1942-1943, tens of millions of people in the enemy-occupied areas of North China fought against locusts, wiping out the locusts that covered the sky in earth pits and under brooms. This was unprecedented in history. Last spring and summer, we resisted minor insect and drought problems. When the flood occurred, party, government, army, and civilians rushed to the embankment to rescue, with cadres taking the lead, and tens of thousands of people went to the scene. The Yellow River embankment was in disrepair, and the flow was the largest in more than a decade, but it did not breach, saving millions of acres of land from being submerged. This must be considered a miracle. After the autumn floods, in order to shorten the disaster period, we vigorously organized the masses to drain water and plant wheat, proposing the principle of "small interests subordinate to large interests, low-lying areas subordinate to high-lying areas, and downstream areas subordinate to upstream areas," so that the area planted with wheat in the disaster area reached more than 80 percent of the affected area. Immediately afterwards, we mobilized disaster victims to develop sideline production, and cadres at all levels went deep into the disaster areas to help them make sideline production plans, using all kinds of local materials. According to preliminary statistics from the Pingyuan disaster area, more than 200 kinds of sideline industries have been mobilized. The development of sideline production must rely on the role of cooperatives. In Hebei, Pingyuan, and other places, through the method of signing contracts with cooperatives, the sideline industries in the disaster area have been kept on track with a plan. The government has taken out grain to purchase native cloth, totaling 126.35 million jin. The second is work-for-relief. Last year, they suffered from water damage, and this year a large amount of grain was allocated for water conservancy projects. Simply repairing the Shuyi Erhe River and the sea embankment in northern Jiangsu reached 230 million jin, and the rest is disaster relief work. If we had not done this series of work, and had not rushed to rescue, the Yellow River would have definitely breached; if we had not drained water and planted wheat, the summer harvest this year would have been less, and the disaster period would have been longer; if we had not developed sideline industries, millions of people would have been sitting and waiting to be fed. Just imagine what the disaster situation would be like today?

    Combining disaster relief with production and with the people's urgent construction is something that the governments of the old era never thought of.

    Third, carry out social mutual assistance and a thrift campaign: "One arm is weak, two arms are strong. Disaster victims should help each other in production. Disaster victims with and without labor should help each other. Disaster victims with labor and with funds should help each other. Disaster victims and non-disaster victims should help each other. Disaster areas and non-disaster areas should help each other," "Mobilize to save, save on food and clothing, and plan for the long term," "Organ cadres should take the lead in saving for disaster relief." This movement has achieved remarkable results. Since last October, the staff of the central organs have donated 1.2 billion yuan in relief funds and 390,000 jin of grain. The North China Military Region saved 3.6 million jin in six months. The industrial and commercial circles of Beijing and Tianjin raised 1.278 billion yuan and 780,000 jin of grain. The rural areas of Hebei Province, which were not affected by the disaster, launched a "handful of rice for disaster relief campaign," raising 12.5 million jin of grain. Other provinces have also achieved great results, which is not only a strong material support, but also a great encouragement to the production and relief of the vast number of disaster victims.

    Regarding the issue of government and people loans, in addition to general agricultural loans, the government allocated 14.5 million jin of coarse grain for fine grain. The issue of free lending and mutual relief among rural areas has also developed. According to reports, such as in Daqing District, Xiping County, Shaanxi Province, 78 households lent 8,150 jin of peanuts, 150 jin of cotton, and 14 shi of grain and beans. Lintong lent 302 shi of wheat, solving the funding difficulties of 119 households. Mutual assistance or loans among farmers in Daming County, Hebei Province, reached more than 2 million jin of millet. In other places, there are also many cases of using loans to solve disasters. However, it should be pointed out that free lending in rural areas, including mutual assistance, has not been widely carried out. One is because the work in some areas is biased, resulting in forced borrowing and hiding by those with surplus grain. On the other hand, although the government and the people and people's organizations are united, people's organizations still lack mass relief organizations established according to the government's relief policies, such as those to be discussed at this representative conference. This is an aspect that should be paid special attention to in the future.

    Fourth, regarding disaster relief: As mentioned above, some disaster victims need a little relief, while others need more relief to overcome the disaster. In addition to other aspects, the government has allocated a total of 34,040,000 jin of emergency relief grain and relief grain. The method of distribution is not just to distribute and be done with it, but to first conduct investigations and hold mass meetings to determine who should receive more and who should receive less. In each village, determine which household should receive more and which should receive less, so that the distribution is appropriate and falls into the hands of disaster victims who deserve it. Second, it is not enough to just distribute correctly. We propose that "the process of distribution is the process of organization": actively organize and invest relief grain into production, turning one dou into two dou or three dou; passively organize and call for "a trickle," eat with other things, and do not eat it all in a few days, but calculate to the time when there is new food to eat. At the same time, the people have many methods, and what we cannot think of, the local people can always think of. The farmers in eastern Hebei said: "Don't look down on our poor place, it is often the wealthy areas that starve people to death, not us."

    I will only say these things about the experience of disaster relief work. The main difference between people's disaster relief work and the disaster relief work of the old society is this.

    III.

    Our correct disaster relief policies and methods have achieved extraordinarily great results, but there are still many shortcomings. This is mainly due to the aggression of imperialism for more than a hundred years, especially the huge war destruction, burning, killing, and plundering by U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang bandit gang. The people have no savings, and the foundation is very weak, and the people are still in the process of the war not being completely over, and they have not had time to breathe. At the same time, although we have experience in fighting against disasters, our experience in such a large-scale nationwide struggle is still very insufficient. The number of cadres is small, the quality is also low, the work is not skilled, and the foresight, instruction, and work inspection of the leadership are not profound and timely. In some areas: attention is paid to severely affected areas, and lightly affected areas are ignored; attention is paid to sideline industries, and spring plowing is ignored; attention is paid to this aspect, and that aspect is ignored. The cooperation of various departments is not enough, grain lending is not thorough, and bureaucratic work styles still seriously exist. Although these serious shortcomings and errors have been repeatedly corrected, some are only beginning to be reversed now. This cannot but be a regrettable thing. Naturally, the highest organs doing civil affairs work should bear the main responsibility and should make the greatest efforts to do this work well. In particular, I hope that the national people's representatives and organizations who are enthusiastic about disaster relief will assist the government in doing this work well. Now, responsible comrades at all levels from the central government to the provinces and regions are working there, and any relaxation, paralysis, or complacency is not allowed.

    We ask this conference to review the disaster relief work, point out errors, propose methods, and give great assistance.

    The Central People's Government has invested 153 million jin of grain in disaster relief, which has never happened in any previous era. The work execution is quite compact. There is only one and a half months left before the summer harvest, and there is sufficient spring rain, and a good wheat harvest is expected. We want to train our staff (including myself) in this disaster relief work and improve all our work. We want to do a good job in agricultural construction (such as this time repairing water conservancy), so that if we encounter drought, floods, insects, etc., they will not be disasters or will be very light disasters. We want to make long-term famine preparedness plans, such as rural grain accumulation and public grain storage. In addition, we want to develop a social mutual assistance and mutual relief movement, to use the power of the people to make up for all the shortcomings in society, and to achieve self-help and mutual help, and self-reliance and mutual assistance.

    Let the creators of China's disasters—imperialism and its running dog bandits—rejoice in our misfortune! They thought that the old rich squeezed the peasants' blood and sweat, and when the peasants could not live, they would have to kowtow to the old rich to beg for the remaining dregs, thus consolidating his rule. Tell them: such an era has gone forever, the Chinese people have broken the shackles on their necks and stood up. The Chinese people have already defeated imperialism and its running dog Kuomintang bandit gang with their own strength, and are defeating the disasters they have created and beginning to build a new prosperous new democratic society!

　　我们能够战胜灾荒
    一九五○年四月二十五日在中国人民救济代表会议上的报告
    谢觉哉主席、各位代表：
    一
    去年全国不少地区有灾，特别是华东的苏北、皖北、山东及华北的河北、平原的水灾甚为严重。虽然就全国范围说，去年全国被灾程度不等的农田一万万二千一百五十六万亩，被灾程度不同的农民约四千万人，比之一九三一年大水灾、八个省受灾农田一万万五千七百八十五万亩、被灾农民五千二百七十一万人要少。但由于日本帝国主义的八年侵略战争及在美帝国主义支援下的蒋匪的四年反人民战争，强改河道，炸毁堤防，焚杀搜括，无所不至，大大减弱了人民抗灾的力量，因而使灾荒更趋严重。
    去年灾情一开始，各级人民政府即率领人民和灾荒作斗争，陆续投入救灾方面的粮食达十五万万三千余万斤。对于灾民不是笼统的放救济粮，而是加以区别：四千万灾民中约有百分之二十不需要救济，百分之六十经过组织生产和略加扶持即可渡过灾荒，受灾重而无劳动力或劳动力不足急须救济的只百分之二十，约八百万人。
    现在全国灾情基本上已停止发展，重灾区灾情亦渐趋稳定，严重的春荒已度过了一大半。救灾工作的情况已迭见于报纸及中央政府负责同志的报告中（均见印发的小册子），我不想在这里重复，下面只就救灾工作的经验提出几点，供大会讨论，并请指正。
    二
    旧时代压在人民头上的统治阶级，削弱了人民的抗灾力量，甚至他们直接造灾，然后在自己涨满了的荷包里，拿出些微，假装慈善。虽然在旧社会的慈善团体中也有些好心肠的人，想做点好事，但造灾的力大，救灾的力小，杯水车薪，常常无济于事。新时代——人民的时代，人民以自己的力量，对抗天然以及人为的灾祸——即已被推翻的统治阶级遗留给的疮伤和某些在今天尚难于消灭的灾祸。救灾的本质已变，因而其意义，其方式，其效果也全然不同。比如旧社会说救济工作是“慈善事业”，要被救的人“依赖”他们。而解放区多年来关于农贷、防疫、救灾等工作的实际经验，则提出了在工作者方面要反对恩赐观点，在被救者方面要反对依赖观点。政府的钱、粮，即是人民的钱、粮，有何恩赐？人帮助我，我也帮助人，一时接受帮助，为的将来不要帮助，有何依赖？事实证明：凡能克服恩赐与依赖两观点的，在他面前就没有不可战胜的困难。反之，工作效果就要差些。人民政府的救灾是本此方针的。因此，其方式与效果，与旧社会的救灾有根本的区别。兹举其大者如后：
    第一、救灾方针和办法，要为人民所掌握，力量才大。要使人民掌握救灾政策，先得各级干部能掌握政策，而干部中的高级干部就必深入灾区亲自领导。中央人民政府前后曾派五个视察组，由人民监察委员会刘景范副主任、内务部武新宇副部长、陈其瑗副部长等领导，分别到达平原、河北、山东、苏北、皖北灾区。河北杨秀峰主席，平原韩哲一副主席，河南吴芝圃主席，华东中南各省区均有高级负责同志率领干部往灾区视察，并长驻指导工作。河北杨秀峰主席亲走了十六个县四十七个村子，现又去了皖北。河北全省干部下乡救灾的达四千多人。干部的经验和能力应比一般人民强，高级干部比一般干部又强。他们和人民一道研究问题，解决问题，帮助生产，共同生活，这就使得我们生产自救、社会互助、以工代赈、辅之必要的救济的方针，不止为各级干部所掌握且能为人民所掌握。另一个方式，则是通过灾区的各界代表会议及人民代表大会，由灾民代表们自己讨论，经过他们去组织人民。如平原省金乡县原发动到百分之三十四的群众生产，在各界代表会召开后，发动男劳动力增至百分之七十一，女劳动力增至百分之六十二。河北武清县开过各界代表会后，纠正了干部好高鹜远的空计划，接受了从小处着手的精神。经验证明：凡人代会开得好的，灾情也就马上被扭转。
    为使救灾工作在统一领导之下，集中力量，配合行动，自中央至各省区政府都组织有生产救灾委员会。
    第二、我们不是把救灾看作只是“赈救”，而是把他看做是一系列的对灾荒斗争的工作。春旱吧，挑水点种。虫灾吧，群众捕打。一九四二——三年华北敌后区成千万的人民和蝗虫作战，把蔽天的蝗虫消灭在土坑里扫帚下，这是史所未有的事。去年春夏稍有虫旱，都抵御住了。及水灾发生，党政军民上堤抢险，干部带头，万人齐赴。黄河堤防失修，流量之大又为十数年来所未有，而没有决堤，使千万亩田地免遭淹没，不能不叹为奇迹。秋汛过后，为缩短灾期，又大力组织群众排水种麦，提出“小利服从大利，洼地服从高地，下游服从上游”的原则，使灾区种麦面积竟达受灾面积的百分之八十以上。随即又发动灾民开展副业生产，各级干部深入灾区，帮助他们做副业生产计划，各种各样就地取材。据平原灾区初步统计，已经动员起来的副业约二百余种。副业生产的发展必须依靠合作社的作用，河北、平原等地通过与合作社订合同的办法，使灾区副业保持了有计划的进行，仅仅政府拿出收购土布的粮食即共达一二六三五万斤。其次是以工代赈，去年受了水的害，今年拨出水利工程粮为数极大，仅仅苏北修整沭沂二河及海堤即达两万万三千万斤，剩下的才是赈救工作。假如我们不是做了这一系列工作，不力抢险，黄河必决；不排水种麦，今年夏收必少，灾期要更延长；不发展副业，千百万人将坐以待食，试想想今天的灾况将是怎样？
    把救灾与生产相结合与人民的迫切建设相结合，这是旧时代政府没想过的。
    第三、开展社会互济和节约运动：“一个膀子力小，两个膀子力大，灾民与灾民搞生产要互助，灾民中有劳力和无劳力的要互助，有劳力与有资金的要互助，灾民与非灾民要互助，灾区与非灾区要互助”，“发动节约，省吃俭用，长期打算”，“机关干部，要带头节约救灾”。这一运动已有显著成绩。中央各机关工作人员自去年十月来已捐出赈款十二亿元，粮食三十九万斤，华北军区六个月即节约了三百六十万斤。京津两市工商业界即劝募款项十二亿七千八百余元，粮食七十八万斤。河北省非灾区的农村进行“一把米救灾运动”，即募得粮食一千二百五十万斤。其他各省均获得巨大成绩，这不仅是物质上的有力支持，且对广大灾民生产渡荒情绪上也是莫大的鼓舞。
    关于政府与人民借贷问题，除一般的农贷外，政府拨出以粗粮换细粮达一四五○○万斤，农村间的自由借贷与相互救济问题也有发展。根据报告：如陕西西平县大庆区七十八户借出花生八千一百五十斤，棉花一百五十斤，谷、豆十四石。临潼借出小麦三百零二石，解决了一百一十九户的资金困难。河北大名县农民中的互助或借贷达二百多万斤小米。其他各地，用借贷方式解决灾荒的情况也多。但应该指出：农村里的自由借贷连互助在内，尚没有普遍开展，一是由于某些地区工作有偏向，致发生有强借及有余粮者藏匿的现象。另一方面，政府与人民及人民团体虽然结合一致，但人民团体中尚缺乏根据政府救济方针成立的群众救济团体如本代表会议所要讨论的。这是今后应特别注意的方面。
    第四、关于赈济：上面说过，一部分灾民需要稍为救济，另一部分需要更多的救济，才能渡过灾荒。救济粮食，除其他方面的外，政府拨出的急赈粮与救济粮共达三四○四○万斤。发放的方法，不是放了了事，而是首先经过调查，群众会议，谁处应多，谁处可少，每个村子里谁家应多，谁家可少，务使发放恰当，落在应得者的灾民手里。其次不是发对了就了事，我们提出“发放的过程即是组织的过程”：积极的组织，把救灾粮投入生产，一斗变成二斗三斗；消极的组织，叫“细水长流”，配合一些东西吃，不要几天吃光了，而要计算吃到有新东西可吃的时候。同时老百姓的办法多着，我们想不出的，当地人民总想得出来。冀东的农民说：“不要看我们的地方穷，饿死人的常是富裕地区而不是我们这里”。
    关于救灾工作经验，我只说这些。人民救灾工作与旧社会救灾工作的主要区别，就是如此。
    三
    我们正确的救灾方针和办法，获得了异常伟大成绩，但仍有不少缺点，这主要是百余年来帝国主义的侵略，尤其美帝国主义及其走狗国民党匪帮的巨大战争破坏烧杀与搜刮，人民没有储蓄，底子很薄，而人民又还在战争没全部结束，没有喘过气来的时候。同时我们虽有和灾荒斗争经验，而对于这样大的带全国性的斗争经验还很不够，干部数量少，质量也低，工作不熟练，领导方面的预见指示及工作检查都不深刻、及时。某些地区：注意重灾区，忽视轻灾区；注意副业，忽视春耕；注意这方面，忽视了那方面，各种部门工作配合不够，粮食贷放欠周密；官僚主义作风还严重存在；这些严重缺点和错误，虽屡给纠正，但仍有直到现在才开始扭转的。这不能不是一件憾事。自然做民政工作的最高机关应负主要责任，应该尽最大努力，做好这工作。尤其希望全国热心救济的人民代表及团体，协助政府来做好这工作。现在中央以至省区各级负责同志都正在那里作，任何松懈、麻痹、自满是不允许的。
    我们要求本大会检讨救灾工作，指正错误，提出办法，并给以极大帮助。
    中央人民政府投入救灾方面的粮食达十五万万三千万斤，这是以前任何时代没有过的，工作执行，做到相当紧凑，现离夏收只一个半月，春雨充分，麦收有望。我们要在这次救灾工作中锻炼工作人员（连我自己在内），改进我们的一切工作。我们要做好农业建设（如这回修水利等），使以后碰到旱、涝、虫等，不为灾或为灾很轻。我们要作长久备荒计划，如农村的积谷社谷，公家储粮等。此外我们要发展社会互助互济运动，以人民的力量弥补社会上一切缺陷，实现自救互救，自助互助。
    让中国灾荒的制造者——帝国主义及其走狗匪帮去幸灾乐祸罢！他们以为老财榨取了农民的血汗，农民到不能活时，又得向老财磕头乞取余沥，因而巩固他的统治的时代还存在。告诉他们：这样的时代已一去不复返了，中国人民打掉了颈上的枷锁，站起来了。中国人民已经以自己的力量战胜了帝国主义及其走狗国民党匪帮，且正在战胜他们所制造出来的灾荒而在开始建设新的繁荣的新民主主义社会！
