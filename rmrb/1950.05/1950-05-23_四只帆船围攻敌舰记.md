　　Record of Four Sailing Boats Besieging the Enemy Ship
    Wang Zhenhe
    During a sea exercise on March 24th, the guard company and the fifth company's four sailing boats lost contact with the main force. They stayed overnight on the sea and sailed north with the current at dawn. While sailing in the middle of the stream, the sentries on each boat simultaneously reported: "Enemy ship is coming!" So the four boats immediately dispersed, while taking care of each other: "Don't rush! Wait until we get close, don't let the 'Old Buffalo' run away."
    In the distant waves, an enemy ship moved up and down towards this side, and the hull gradually changed from small to large. The soldiers on the ship stared at it intently. The gunner moved the sight, the machine gunner gripped the trigger, and the rifles of the rifle squad were also neatly placed on the sandbags, holding their breath and waiting for it to sail over.
    Still three miles away, the stern of the enemy ship suddenly turned to this side, and several puffs of white smoke emerged, and it fired several shots, but they all fell into the sea hundreds of meters away, stirring up several columns of water. These few shots amused everyone, and they said, "What accurate Chiang bandit gunners."
    The sound of the motor became louder and louder, and the surrounding waves became bigger and bigger. The enemy ship fired while heading straight for the guard company's boat. When it was about 100 meters away, the company instructor on the boat shouted, "Fire!" Light and heavy weapons spat out countless tongues of fire, hitting the enemy ship and causing sparks to fly. The enemy ship quickly turned around. Knowing that the three boats of the Fifth Company had also spread out a fire net, the four boats surrounded it in the middle and fired fiercely, not giving it a chance to breathe. The enemy ship spun around in the fire net. Guns and cannons on the sailing boats kept firing. Gunner Zhang Xuewen fired two shells in a row, hitting the enemy ship's turret. Then Luo Huiwen hit the stern of the enemy ship with another shot, and Teng Tian of the guard company also hit a shot. The enemy ship emitted four thick plumes of smoke and fire, and pieces of flying wood fell into the water, and water splashed around the ship. The bandit soldiers panicked and rushed to the hatch. The hull also began to shake violently, and then it tilted to the side and was paralyzed on the water.

　　四只帆船围攻敌舰记
    王振和
    某部警卫连和五连的四只帆船在三月二十四日的漂海演习中，和大队失去联络，便停在大海里过夜，拂晓时才顺流北驶。航行至中流，忽然各船监视哨同时报告：敌舰来了！”于是四只船立刻散开，一面互相关照着：“别忙！等靠近了再打，别让‘老水牛’跑了”
    在远处浪头里，一艘敌舰朝着这边忽上忽下地移动着，舰身渐渐由小而大。船上的战士们紧紧地盯着它。炮手移动着瞄准器，机枪射手紧扣住扳机，排枪组的步枪也一列妥贴地安置在沙包上面，屏息地等着它驶过来。
    还隔着三里路，敌舰的尾部忽然掉向这一边，冒出了几股白烟，就通通地打来几炮，但都落在百米外的海水里，掀起了几股浪柱。这几下，把大家全逗笑了，说：“好准的蒋匪炮手。”
    马达声越来越响，周围的浪也越来越大，敌舰一边放炮一边对着警卫连的船直驶过来。到了百米左右，船上的连指导员喊出一声：“打！”轻重火器吐出无数道火舌，打得敌舰身上直冒火星，敌舰连忙转回头来。那知五连三只船又撒开了火网，四只船把它围在中间一个劲地猛打，不让它有喘息的机会。敌舰在火网中团团乱转。帆船上枪炮不断地轰射着。炮手张学文接连打出两发炮弹落在敌舰炮楼，接着罗会文一炮又击中敌舰尾部，警卫连的滕田世也命中了一炮。敌舰冒起了四股浓烈的烟火，飞起的木头一块一块地落到水里，舰旁水花四溅。匪军仓皇失措地拥向舱口。舰身也开始剧烈地震荡起来，接着便向边旁一歪瘫痪在水上了。
