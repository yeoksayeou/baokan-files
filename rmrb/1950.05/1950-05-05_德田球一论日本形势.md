Editor's Note: According to Xinhua News Agency, the 19th Central Committee Plenary Session of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), held in Tokyo from April 28th to 30th, adopted the strategic and tactical thesis drafted by the JCP General Secretary. Prior to this, Tokuda delivered a report entitled "The New Situation and the Corresponding Policy of Our Party" at the 18th Enlarged Central Committee Meeting of the JCP held in January this year. The Soviet Pravda published the full text of the report on April 15th. This newspaper now introduces the main points of the report from the JCP's organ, Akahata, which we recently received, as follows:

In his report, Tokuda pointed out that the basic characteristic of the current international situation is: "The new upsurge of people's power has destroyed the offensive of international monopoly capital attempting to dominate the world, and forced it to retreat rapidly." Tokuda analyzed that the "main reasons" for this characteristic are: "A. The rapid growth of the socialist and people's democratic systems exposes the corruption and crisis of the capitalist system, plunging it into a state of instability; thus, the people's revolution, led by the working class, is advancing towards socialism and people's democracy.

B. The Soviet Union has secured atomic energy, demonstrating the great progress of the socialist economy; at the same time, it gives the people's power great confidence and smashes the intimidation policy of monopoly capital. Generally, atomic energy can be used as a power source, expanding its application, therefore it has become an inviolable revolutionary fortress and material foundation.

C. The rapid development of the Chinese revolution has enabled the national liberation of Asian countries to develop rapidly. Vietnam has liberated 95 percent of its territory, forming a situation in which France can no longer cope with its own strength. French workers and progressive people are demanding recognition of Vietnam's independence and immediate withdrawal of troops. In Burma, the power of the Thakim Nu regime, based on the traitorous Socialist Party, has been reduced to a range of more than ten miles around the capital, Rangoon, and large liberated areas have been established in various important areas, paralyzing the Thakim Nu regime. In Malaya, the British intervention war, despite deploying 120,000 troops, has failed to overwhelm the guerrillas, and the guerrillas are establishing liberated areas everywhere. In Indonesia, Indonesia's independence shows that the Netherlands cannot control it on its own, and international monopoly capital has begun to invade the area. In the Philippines, the revolutionary forces continue to rise.

India's espousal of neutrality between revolutionary forces and monopoly capital is because it can no longer ignore the people's liberation movements in these Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, the so-called establishment of an anti-communist front headed by India is difficult to achieve. To nurture an anti-communist front can only result in a large amount of waste, and it will definitely not succeed, needless to say. The great Chinese revolution has an impact not only on the above-mentioned areas, but also on the Far East, and even the whole world.

D. Serious conflicts have occurred in capitalist countries. The Western European countries participating in the "Marshall" Plan are deeply panicked, and the conflicts are sharp. Any US aid cannot eliminate this conflict, but instead sharpens it due to the scramble for US aid materials. In this situation of increasingly narrow international markets, the major issue of whether to recognize revolutionary China has arisen. Although the United States has adopted a stubborn attitude of refusal, with Burma and India taking the lead, Britain has also recognized China, and other capitalist countries will have to follow suit. As a result, the United States will soon be forced to recognize it as well. Generally, warmongers want to prevent the CCP from controlling Taiwan, but due to the conflicts between countries, international monopoly capital is being strongly resisted, so military intervention in Taiwan is impossible. This epoch-making upsurge of people's power has greatly shaken the rule of international monopoly capital based in "Wall Street."

Regarding the current situation in Japan, Tokuda's report pointed out: The Liberal Democratic Party's Yoshida Cabinet has become a thorough traitor. Establishing military bases in Japan is nothing more than to involve Japan in the Third World War, taking on an important role. The Yoshida Cabinet willingly acts as a tool of monopoly capital, dreaming of restoring the Emperor's imperial system. Yoshida wants to complete a huge armed police force under the cover of foreign troops, and attempts to further restore a formal army. Now the government ignores economic collapse and educational destruction, but the police expenditure has increased by more than 60 percent compared to last year, and it is strengthening its equipment and giving it military training. The government is working to lift the banishment of war criminals and sympathize with reactionary underground organizations, and turns a blind eye to old soldiers crossing the sea to China (referring to Japanese military personnel going to Taiwan to assist the Chiang bandits in combat). International monopoly capital wants to invest in Japan, making Japan an effective base for exporting trade to Southeast Asian countries. The Yoshida Cabinet is quite active in its policy of absorbing foreign capital, which has already been implemented in the kerosene industry. Under the policies of the Yoshida Cabinet, monopoly capital has gained great benefits, and profits are constantly rising, while national capital and small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises are bankrupt due to financial difficulties. In order to maintain its interests, monopoly capital tries its best to reduce workers' wages and vigorously implements labor intensification. The number of fully unemployed and semi-unemployed workers has actually reached 12 million, and the income of employed workers is also difficult to maintain their livelihoods. The exploitation of peasants has reached an intolerable level, and grain collection has exceeded production. The implementation of the Temporary Measures Law to ensure food supply has subjected rural areas to repression even more severe than the Emperor system.

Tokuda's report then focused on exposing the "separate peace" policy. Tokuda said: "The current separate peace is actually being carried out in stages. But from the perspective of international relations, the hope of a separate peace is gradually weakening, so they attempt to replace the separate peace with a "declaration of the end of the war" at that time. But this means that Japan will degenerate into a de facto colony of a specific country, which, judging from the concrete manifestations so far, is indisputable. So a separate peace is not a peace. It is a confirmation of abandoning national independence for international monopoly capital, and becoming a slave."

In response to the above situation, Tokuda pointed out that the current policy of the Japanese Communist Party is: "In order to break through the national crisis, stabilize people's lives, ensure national independence and world peace, it is necessary to complete a comprehensive peace including the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China." Tokuda said: "In the program put forward by our party at the Sixth Congress three years ago, we first listed (1) strictly implementing the Potsdam Declaration; (2) reviving the economy by the people and Japan's complete independence, which is the basis of the "comprehensive peace based on the Potsdam Declaration" that we are now demanding. … In order to determine the policy of our party, we need to be more explicit and put forward the following slogans:

1. Oppose a separate peace that leads to war, and promote a comprehensive peace based on cooperation among great powers to ensure peace.

2. Oppose a separate peace that strengthens colonization and fascism, and promote a comprehensive peace of freedom, independence, democracy and prosperity. Tokuda said: "These issues must be based on the implementation of the daily requirements of the masses, and raise them to the political demands of the class. Our party will make every effort to complete it. This will be decisive for the completion of the people's revolution. Therefore, it is the primary task to overthrow the Liberal Democratic Party Yoshida Cabinet, which is carrying out a separate peace. For this reason, it is also necessary to organize a democratic national front including people from all walks of life, including national capitalists. As for promoting a comprehensive peace, if the masses do not understand the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it will not become a powerful force. At the same time, it should be emphasized that free trade, transportation, and cultural exchanges between Japan and the above-mentioned countries are indispensable conditions for the revival of Japan. Furthermore, we must emphasize the international solidarity of the proletariat."

In the conclusion of the meeting, Tokuda called for efforts to launch a movement to promote a comprehensive peace: "Regardless of political views, political parties, or beliefs, patriots who agree to a comprehensive peace should combine their forces." "Use mass demonstrations, conferences, rallies, petitions, protests, articles, signature campaigns, opinion polls, joint committees in factories, rural areas, schools, and residences, and other methods to promote a comprehensive peace."

Tokuda said at the end of his conclusion: "Our party must complete the tasks entrusted to it by the Japanese nation and the joint responsibility of the international proletariat. Of course, to complete this task and responsibility, the people's forces, led by workers, all over the world will provide assistance, but we ourselves must stand up and complete this important task."

　　德田球一论日本形势
    编者按：据新华社讯，四月二十八日至三十日在东京举行的日共第十九次中央委员会全体会议已通过日共总书记所起草的战略战术论文。在此以前，德田曾在今年一月间举行的日共第十八次扩大中央委员会会议上作过一个题为《新的形势和与此相适应的我党政策》的报告，苏联真理报曾于四月十五日将该报告全文登载。本报现从最近收到的日共机关报赤旗报将该报告要点介绍如次：
    德田在报告中指出目前国际形势的基本特点是：“人民力量的新高涨，摧毁了国际垄断资本企图统治世界的攻势，而迫其迅速向后退却。”德田分析说：产生这一特点的“主要原因为：Ａ、社会主义与人民民主主义体制的迅速成长暴露着资本主义体制的腐败与崩溃的危机，而使其陷于不安定之状态；于是以工人阶级为首的人民革命正向着社会主义以及人民民主主义迈进。
    Ｂ、苏联已确保原子能，表现了社会主义经济的伟大进展；同时给予人民力量以极大的确信，并击破了垄断资本的恫吓政策。将原子能作为动力的源泉而扩大其应用的范围，一般都已经能够用原子能作为发电源，因此它已成为不可侵犯的革命的堡垒和物质的基础。
    Ｃ、中国革命飞跃的发展，使亚洲各国的民族解放获得迅速的发展。越南解放了领土百分之九十五，形成法国单凭自己力量已无可奈何的状态，法国的工人和进步的人们，正在要求承认越南独立，立即撤回军队。在缅甸，以卖国的社会党为基础的达钦努政权势力，在首都仰光已被缩小至周围十余英里的范围以内，而且在各重要地区已成立了大解放区，使得达钦努政权陷于麻痹。在马来，英国的干涉战争，尽管投入十二万军队，并未能压倒游击队，而游击队却在各处建立着解放区。在印尼，印尼的独立，说明了荷兰单凭自己已不能控制，而国际垄断资本已经开始侵入该地。在菲律宾，革命力量继续在高涨。
    印度之所以标榜在革命力量和垄断资本之间中立，是因为它已不能再漠视这些东南亚各国的人民解放运动。因此，所谓确立以印度为首的防共战线，决难办到。而要育成防共战线，只能赔出大量的浪费，也决难成功，这是不待言的。中国的大革命不仅对于上述各地，即对于远东，甚至全世界都有影响。
    Ｄ、资本主义各国发生了严重的对立，参加“马歇尔”计划的西欧各国，恐慌深刻，对立尖锐，任何美援，不但不能消除这种对立，反而却因抢夺美援物资，更形尖锐化。在这种国际市场日趋狭隘的情况下，就发生了承认革命的中国与否这个重大问题。美国虽采取顽强的拒绝态度，但是以缅甸、印度为领头，英国也承认了中国，其他资本主义国家恐非追随不可。结果不久美国亦将被迫而加以承认。一般战争贩子想阻止中共支配台湾，但因各国间的对立，国际垄断资本正受强烈的反击，所以军事干涉台湾是不可能的。这样人民力量划时代的高涨，已使以“华尔街”为根据地的国际垄断资本的统治，发生极大动摇。”
    关于日本目前的情势，德田的报告指出：民主自由党吉田内阁已成为地道的卖国贼。在日本设立军事基地，不外欲使日本卷入第三次大战，担负重要的角色。吉田内阁甘作垄断资本的爪牙，梦想恢复天皇制的帝国主义。吉田欲借外国军队的掩护，完成庞大的武装警察队，并企图进一步恢复正式军队。现在政府不顾经济崩溃、教育毁灭，惟对警察费则较上年增加百分之六十以上，且加强其装备，施以军事训练。政府正致力于解除战犯之放逐及同情反动的地下组织，对过海到中国的旧军人（指到台湾协助蒋匪作战的日本军事人员），采取熟视无睹的态度。国际垄断资本欲向日本投资，使日本成为对东南亚各国输出贸易的有效的根据地。吉田内阁对于吸收外资政策颇为积极，在煤油产业方面，已经实行。在吉田内阁的政策下，垄断资本获莫大利益，利润正不断上升，而民族资本及中小工商业则都以资金困难而破产。垄断资本为维持其利益起见，尽力减低工人工资，厉行劳动强化。完全失业及半失业工人人数，实际上已达一千二百万，就业工人收入亦难维持生活。对农民的剥削已至不堪忍受的程度，且征粮已超过生产量，因施行确保食粮的临时措置法，使农村受到比天皇制还厉害的弹压。
    德田的报告继而着重揭露“片面讲和”政策。德田说：“现在这种片面讲和，实际上已在分期进行。但从国际关系上说，片面讲和的希望渐趋薄弱，所以又企图届时凭用“战争终了宣言”来代替片面讲和。但这种事情，却意味着使日本堕落为特定国家实际上的殖民地，这一点，由直到现在的具体表现看来，已无可争辩。所以片面讲和并不是讲和。它是确认为国际垄断资本而放弃民族独立，而变成奴隶。”
    针对以上情况，德田指出目前日本共产党的政策是：“为冲破民族危机，安定人民生活，确保民族独立和世界和平计，必须完成包括苏联及中华人民共和国的全面讲和。”德田说：“本党于三年前第六次大会所提纲领中，首先列举（一）严正实施波茨坦宣言；（二）由人民复兴经济与日本完全独立，是即我们现在所要求的“根据波茨坦宣言的全面讲和”的基础。……为确定本党的政策，需要更加明确，提出下列口号：
    一、反对导向战争的单独讲和，促进基于大国间之合作，保障和平的全面讲和。
    二、反对强化殖民地化与法西斯主义的单独讲和，促进自由、独立、民主主义与繁荣的全面讲和。德田说：“这些问题，必须把基点放在贯彻群众日常身边的要求上，并使之提高到阶级的政治的要求。本党将尽一切努力来完成它。这对于完成人民革命将是决定性的东西。所以必须打倒正在进行片面讲和的民自党吉田内阁，是当前的首要工作。为此，也有组织包括民族资本家在内的各阶层人民的民主民族战线的必要。至于促进全面讲和，如群众对于苏联、中华人民共和国及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，没有理解，就不会成为强有力的东西。同时应强调日本与上述各国进行自由贸易，交通及文化交流，这是复兴日本所不可或缺的条件。更进一步，我们必须强调无产阶级国际的连带性。”
    德田在会议的结语中号召努力发起促进全面讲和运动：“不问政治见解、所属政党、信仰如何，凡赞成全面讲和的爱国者把力量结合起来。”“利用群众示威运动、大会、集会、请愿、抗议、文章、签名运动、舆论调查、工厂、农村、学校、住宅的共同委员会等种种方法，促进全面讲和。”
    德田在其结语的末尾说：“我党必须完成日本民族付给的任务和国际无产阶级的联带责任。当然为完成这个任务和责任，全世界以工人为首的人民力量会加以援助，但我们自己必须挺身起来，完成这个重大任务。”
