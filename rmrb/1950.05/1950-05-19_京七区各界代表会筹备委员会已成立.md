【Beijing News Agency Dispatch】The Preparatory Committee for the People's Representatives Conference of the Seventh District (formerly the Tenth District) of Beijing was formally established on the 15th and has begun its work. It has also started to nominate representatives to attend the conference. This is one of the key districts that the Beijing Municipal People's Government is piloting in advance to implement the resolutions of the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference.

　　The Preparatory Committee for the People's Representatives Conference of the Seventh District consists of fifteen representatives invited by the District Office of the district, including representatives from the Seventh District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, workers, youth, women, education, industry and commerce, street residents, and the Public Security Bureau. At the inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee, Song Rufen, Secretary of the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, was elected as the chairman, and Zhang Huamin, a worker from the Jingwei Weaving Factory, and Sui Jingren, manager of the China Science Enterprise Company, were elected as vice-chairmen. The Preparatory Committee listened to a report by Han Linguang, the head of the district, on convening the District People's Representatives Conference. It discussed and approved the method for the election of representatives, and also discussed the allocation of representative quotas. It was decided that the 13th Police Station of the district would be the focus, and district resident representatives would be elected first to gain experience and promote it throughout the district.

　　Assisted by cadres allocated by the district, the 13th Police Station, starting on the 16th, first divided the 1,672 households in its jurisdiction into 30 groups to carry out publicity and solicit opinions through forums and individual interviews. Then, on the 17th, using methods such as raising hands, throwing beans, drawing lines, and drawing circles, it initially selected 30 resident representatives from more than 90 candidates in each group. After another election, three representatives to the District People's Representatives Conference will be produced. Most of the elections were conducted in a solemn and warm atmosphere. After the election, the residents of Shatushan Street happily lifted up the elected representative Chang Xinquan and cheered. Wu, an old lady who participated in the election, said: "The current government is really doing things for us. With the opening of the District Representatives Conference, we are closer to the government!"
