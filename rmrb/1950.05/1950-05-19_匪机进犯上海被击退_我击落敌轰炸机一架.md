Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th: On the evening of May 11th at 9:00 PM, four American-made bandit planes in three waves invaded Shanghai. The first wave was repelled by the People's Liberation Army's air defense forces. A B-24 bomber from the second wave, which sneaked into Shanghai airspace at 9:41 PM, was met with a fierce counterattack, hit, caught fire, and crashed in Pudong. The other bandit planes, under the intense anti-aircraft fire of the People's Liberation Army's air defense forces, failed to enter the city and fled in disarray.
