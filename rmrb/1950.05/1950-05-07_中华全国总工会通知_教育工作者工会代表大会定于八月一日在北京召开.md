　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions Notice
    National Congress of Education Workers' Trade Union to be Convened in Beijing on August 1st
    【Xinhua News Agency, 5th】The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has decided to convene the first National Congress of Education Workers' Trade Union in Beijing on August 1st of this year. The notice regarding the convening of this congress was issued today.
    The notice first pointed out: In order to transform culturally backward China into a culturally advanced China, Chinese education workers shoulder a major historical mission. In order for Chinese education workers to victoriously shoulder and complete their historical mission, they must first organize themselves. According to incomplete statistics, the total number of education workers in China (including faculty and staff of universities, middle schools, primary schools, social education institutions, and education administrators) is approximately 700,000. The vast majority of education workers rely on wage (salary) income as the entirety or primary source of their livelihood as mental wage laborers. Therefore, Chinese education workers should be an integral part of the entire Chinese working class; the education workers' trade union should also be an important trade union organization unit under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. To this end, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has decided to convene the first National Congress of Education Workers' Trade Union on August 1st of this year.
    The notice said: The first National Congress of Education Workers' Trade Union will mainly discuss and resolve the following issues:

　　中华全国总工会通知
    教育工作者工会代表大会定于八月一日在北京召开
    【新华社五日讯】中华全国总工会已决定今年八月一日在北京召开第一次全国教育工作者工会代表大会。关于召开这一大会的通知已于今日发出。
    通知首先指出：为了要把文化落后的中国，变为文化先进的中国，中国的教育工作者是负有重大的历史使命。为了使中国的教育工作者能够胜利的负担起并完成其历史使命，首先就要组织起来。根据不完全的统计，目前中国的教育工作者（包括大、中、小、社的教职工警及教育行政人员在内）的总人数大约有七十万左右。教育工作者绝大多数都是依靠工资（薪水）收入为自己生活资料的全部或主要来源的脑力雇佣劳动者。因此，中国的教育工作者应当是整个中国工人阶级的一个组成部分；教育工作者工会也应当是中华全国总工会领导下的一个重要的工会组织单位。为此，中华全国总工会决定于本年八月一日召开第一次全国教育工作者工会代表大会。
    通知说：第一次全国教育工作者工会代表大会主要讨论并解决以下几个问题：
    １、目前教育工作者工会的方针任务问题。
    ２、制订教育工作者工会的章程。
    ３、教育工作者工会的基层组织问题。
    ４、教育工作者的学习问题。
    ５、教育工作者的福利事业问题。
    通知宣布：全国总工会已成立全国教育工作者工会工作委员会，负责进行召开第一次全国教育工作者工会代表大会的各种筹备工作。这个委员会以吴玉章、钱端升、刘子久、钱俊瑞、薛成业、萧采瑜、葛志成、王仁忱、张澜庆、温寒江、李广錡、叶维民、李扬、盛瑾、张潮、费振东、孙起孟、雷洁琼、刘皑风、杨静仁等二十人组成。以吴玉章为主任，钱端升、刘子久为副主任。
