　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School Concludes First Session; Second Session Enrollment in Preparation
    [This newspaper Tianjin News] The first session of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School, with over 700 students transferred from trade unions at all levels and major factories across the country for training, has successfully completed its educational plan after six months of intensive study. They returned to their original work posts before May 18th to carry out trade union work. In order to continue cultivating senior and intermediate-level trade union cadres, the school is preparing to enroll the second session of students. The enrollment notice has been issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to trade unions at all levels, and it is planned to start school around July 1st.
    The first session of the school started in November last year. The entire curriculum is divided into two parts: theory and practice. The theory course was taught by the famous professor Ai Siqi, who lectured on historical materialism – the history of social development. The practical courses on the world labor movement and the Soviet labor movement were respectively taught by three Soviet experts: Professors Zhemekhov, Markov, and Gorikin. The part on Chinese labor movement work was lectured by responsible comrades from various departments of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Tianjin.
    Through six months of study, the students' theoretical foundation in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought has been enhanced, their class consciousness and internationalist spirit have been raised, and they have understood the current situation and the tasks of trade union work. Everyone has a basic knowledge of various practical aspects of trade union work, a more systematic understanding of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin regarding trade unions, recognizing that doing trade union work is a glorious task, and realizing that the central task of doing trade union work is to focus on production. Before the end of the study, Principal Li Lisan of the school answered some questions that had not been clearly resolved during the learning process and instructed everyone on how to apply the learned theories to practical work after returning to their work posts.
