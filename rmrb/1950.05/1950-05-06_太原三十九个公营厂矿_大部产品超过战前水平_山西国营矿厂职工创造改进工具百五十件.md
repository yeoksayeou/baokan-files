　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th: The thirty-nine public factories and mines in Taiyuan, one of the industrial centers of North China, have restored their original scale in the past year. The vast majority of major products have exceeded pre-war levels. This is the result of the factories and mines actively reforming the original bureaucratic institutions, corrupt management methods, and worker-suppressing management systems, and mobilizing the workers to improve production and create new records. Products exceeding pre-war levels include steel, iron, coking coal, machinery manufacturing and repair, coal, industrial chemical manufacturing, cement, cloth, paper making, leather, and tobacco. Products exceeding pre-liberation levels or approaching pre-war levels include electricity, spinning, matches, and daily-use chemical manufactured goods. Only the weaving factory's output is lower than pre-liberation levels because it has not fully started operation. Many departments originally engaged in military production have gradually shifted to peaceful production and are vigorously supplying rural needs. The newly established agricultural chemical plant has produced four kinds of insecticides, including copper sulfate and calcium arsenate. Five thousand waterwheels, four hundred cotton gins, and twelve oil presses are being manufactured. In addition, the business operations of the Shanxi Egg Company have begun.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th: Workers in state-owned and province-owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province have made great contributions to improving technology and tools in the past year, becoming an important factor in the continuous improvement of production. From the liberation of Taiyuan in April of last year to April of this year, employees of seventy-nine public factories and mines in Shanxi Province created or improved a total of more than 150 production tools. Among them, the most successful examples are: Ma Yiren, a foreman in the spinning department of the Northwest Wool Textile Factory, worked hard for five days and five nights to transform the wool combing machine, enabling the use of existing waste wool, which solved the factory's raw material problem for half a year. Workers at the Ordnance Bureau Repair Factory successfully manufactured a small generator, which the Kuomintang had been trying to produce for more than a year without success, within a month of liberation. The Northwest Iron and Steel Company's work of rolling steel rails, which had failed twice by the Japanese during the enemy and puppet period, was also successfully trial-produced by the company's workers last year. Mao Changgeng, a worker at the Yangquan State-Owned Melting Plant, used his 30 years of production experience and discussed with other workers many times, using his spare time to concentrate on research, and completed a double-swivel pipe machine, converting the swivel knife into an automatic one, thus saving three-quarters of the number of people watching the lathe. In the past, two people were needed to take care of one lathe, but now one person can take care of two lathes. At the same time, the efficiency of producing six-inch pipes has also increased from ten per lathe per day to fifty-two. After workers at the Ordnance Bureau Repair Factory switched to peaceful production, in addition to producing various machines, they collectively created a steam hammer weighing 25 tons and 12 inches high. In addition, the Taiyuan Weaving Factory reduced raw material consumption by half, the Limin Chemical Company improved the efficiency of soap flaking by 20 times, and the output of the Ordnance Bureau's Sixth Factory increased by four times, all of which are the results of workers' creation and improvement of tools.

　　太原三十九个公营厂矿
    大部产品超过战前水平     
    山西国营矿厂职工创造改进工具百五十件
    【新华社太原三十日电】作为华北工业重心之一的太原市的三十九个公营厂矿，一年来已恢复原有规模；绝大部分的主要产品并已超过抗战前的水平。这是各厂矿积极改革原来的官僚主义机构、腐败的经营方法以及镇压工人的管理制度，发动工人群众改进生产和创造新纪录的结果。超过战前水平的产品，计有钢、铁、焦煤、机械制造和修造、煤、工业化学制造、洋灰、布匹、制纸、皮革、烟草等；超过解放前的水平或接近战前水平的有电力、纺纱、火柴、日用化学制造品；仅织造厂一家因未全部开工，产量低于解放前的水平。许多原为军事生产的部门已陆续转变为和平生产，并大力供应农村需要。新成立的农业化学厂已制出王铜、砒酸钙等四种杀虫剂，五千辆水车、四百部榨花机及十二部榨油机正在制造中，此外，山西蛋业公司的业务经营已开始进行。
    【新华社太原三十日电】山西省各国营省营厂矿的工人，一年来在提高技术改进工具方面，有了很大的贡献，成为生产不断改进的重要因素之一。自去年四月太原解放后到今年四月一年之内，山西省七十九个公营厂矿的职工，创造或改进生产工具共达一百五十多件。其中最有成绩的，例如：西北毛纺织厂纺织部工长马依仁经五天五夜的努力，改造了梳毛机，使原存的废毛得被利用，解决了该厂半年的原料问题。兵工局修造厂的工人，在解放后一个月内便制造成功国民党时代试制年余还没有成功的小型发电机。西北钢铁公司的碾制钢轨工作，在敌伪时代日本人经过二次试验都已失败，也已于去年为该公司工人们试制成功。阳泉国营溶化厂工人毛长庚以三十年的生产经验，和其他工人多次商讨，利用工余时间专心研究，完成了双镟管机，将镟刀改装为自动的，因而使看车头的人数节省了四分之三，过去一个车头要有两个人照顾，现在一个人就能照管两个车头了；同时，生产六英寸管的效率也由每部车床每日生产十根提高到五十二根。兵工局修造厂工人自转为和平生产后，除生产各种机器外，曾集体创制重二十五吨、高十二英寸的蒸气锤一部。此外，太原织造厂原料消耗减少一半，利民化学公司肥皂削片效率提高二十倍，兵工局第六厂产量提高四倍等，都是工人创造和改进工具的结果。
