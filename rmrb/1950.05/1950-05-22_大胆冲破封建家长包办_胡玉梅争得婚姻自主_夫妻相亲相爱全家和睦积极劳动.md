　　【Anxin News from this newspaper】Hu Yumei, a young woman from Anxin County, Hebei Province, dared to wage a resolute struggle against her feudal and backward family and won marital freedom and autonomy.
    Hu Yumei (Communist Party member, village branch committee member of the Communist Youth League), a woman from Dawangting Village, Anxin, is nineteen years old this year. In December last year, when the county held a training class for village branch committee members of the Communist Youth League, she began to fall in love with Wang Zhankui, a member of the Communist Youth League from Gushang Village, through the introduction of Li Changchun from her village and Wang Puer from Gushang Village. After getting to know each other, both parties were willing to become husband and wife. However, Yumei's father, Hu Cai, disagreed. He believed that his daughter's marriage should be decided by her parents, and it would be too shameful for his daughter to make her own decisions. The introducer, Li Changchun, personally went to Yumei's house to discuss the matter with Hu Cai, but Hu Cai neither agreed nor disagreed. After Changchun left, Hu Cai constantly quarreled with the whole family over his daughter's marriage and sometimes sulked and refused to eat. Yumei constantly tried to persuade her father, but to no avail. In order to insist on marital autonomy, she took advantage of her father's absence to personally go to Gushang Village to find the introducer, Wang Puer, to discuss the matter of marrying Zhankui. When Yumei's father, Hu Cai, returned home, he went to the home of the introducer, Li Changchun, and started arguing with Changchun, forcibly dragging Changchun to the district government to file a lawsuit. The two of them were pulling and shoving each other when they met Yumei, Wang Puer, and Wang Zhankui happily returning from the district government with their marriage certificates in the north of Gushang Village. When Hu Cai saw this, he became even angrier, grabbed Yumei's hair, beat her, and scolded her, dragging Yumei home. Coincidentally, they met District Cadre Ma Lingyun, who patiently explained to Hu Cai the policy and benefits of marital freedom, but Hu Cai stubbornly refused to listen and still wanted to beat Yumei. At this time, the introducer, Wang Puer, ran to Gushang Village to find Rong Changsheng, a cadre from the county armed forces department, who patiently explained the principles of marital freedom and autonomy to Hu Cai. Hu Cai was speechless, but still angrily scolded Yumei. Yumei said with confidence, "I am not running away with anyone, this is a correct marriage. I want to make my own decisions about my own affairs." Hu Cai had no choice but to leave in anger. Yumei arrived in Gushang Village, and that night, she and Wang Zhankui officially held their wedding ceremony. After the marriage, they worked hard, getting up early and going to bed late, and their relationship was very harmonious. Her relationship with her husband's family was also very harmonious. Later, Hu Cai gradually understood that free marriage was better than arranged marriage. During the Spring Festival, he asked Yumei's younger brother to bring Yumei home to celebrate the Spring Festival happily.

　　大胆冲破封建家长包办
    胡玉梅争得婚姻自主
    夫妻相亲相爱全家和睦积极劳动
    【本报安新讯】河北安新县青年妇女胡玉梅，敢于和封建落后家庭作坚决斗争，赢得了婚姻自由自主。
    安新大望亭村妇女胡玉梅（共产党员，青年团村支部委员），今年十九岁，去年十二月间，县里召开青年团村支委训练班的时候，经过本村李长春和固上村王璞尔介绍，和固上村青年团员王占奎开始恋爱。双方经过了解，愿意结为夫妇。可是，玉梅的父亲胡才不同意，他认为女儿的亲事应当由父母作主，女儿自己作主太丢人。介绍人李长春亲自到玉梅家和胡才商量，胡才不说同意，也不说不同意。等长春走了以后，胡才为女儿的亲事，便不断和全家吵架，有时还闹脾气不吃饭。玉梅不断地劝说她父亲始终无效，为了坚持婚姻自主，便趁父亲不在家的时候，亲自到固上村找介绍人王璞尔，商量和占奎结婚的事。玉梅的父亲胡才回到家来，就找到介绍人李长春家去，和长春吵起架来，硬拉着长春到区政府去打官司。两人拉拉扯扯走到固上村村北，正遇见玉梅和王璞尔、王占奎三人高高兴兴地从区政府领了结婚证书回来。胡才一见，气头更大了，揪住玉梅的头发，又是打，又是骂，扯着玉梅往家走。恰巧遇见区干部马苓云，经他耐心地给胡才讲婚姻自由的政策和好处，胡才仍顽固不听，还是要打玉梅。这时候，介绍人王璞尔又跑到固上村找来县武装部干部戎常胜，又耐心地给胡才讲婚姻自由自主的道理。胡才被说的无言答对了，可是还气愤愤地骂玉梅。玉梅却理直气壮地说：“我并不是跟着谁跑，这是正确的婚姻。我自己的事，我要自己做主。”胡才无可奈何，只好生气走了。玉梅到了固上村，当天晚上和王占奎正式举行了结婚仪式。结婚后每天早起晚睡积极劳动，夫妇感情非常融洽，和婆家人们的关系都很和睦。后来，胡才也逐渐明白了自由结婚比家长包办婚姻要强的道理，过春节的时候，叫玉梅的弟弟把玉梅接回家来，喜喜欢欢地过了春节。
