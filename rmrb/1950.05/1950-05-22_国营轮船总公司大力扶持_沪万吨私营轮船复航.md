Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th: With the strong support of the state-run shipping company, the private shipping companies in Shanghai, whose ships of over 10,000 tons had been suspended, have recently resumed navigation. Before liberation, four-fifths of the ships of Shanghai's private shipping industry were looted and damaged by bandits. After liberation, they were in a temporary serious difficult situation due to Chiang Kai-shek's blockade and bombing. The state-run shipping company implemented a policy of taking into account both public and private interests, and tried its best to support them. In the past year, it has allocated about 34% of the transported materials to private shipping companies, enabling most of the private shipping ships to resume navigation. However, there were still more than 10,000 tons of private ships that were in a state of suspension due to a lack of cargo, fuel, and sailing expenses. To this end, the state-run shipping company, in addition to assigning large quantities of grain and coal transportation to private shipping companies to help them solve the source of cargo, also provided assistance to private shipping companies with special difficulties in the form of chartering, agency, prepayment of freight, and lending of fuel. For example, it first loaned 444.5 million yuan in freight to eleven ships of Dada Datong Joint Office, Tug and Barge Joint Office, and others, and another 33 tons of diesel and more than 1,500 tons of coal.

　　国营轮船总公司大力扶持
    沪万吨私营轮船复航
    【新华社上海二十日电】上海市私营轮船业中陷于停航状态的万余吨轮船在国营轮船总公司的扶持下，已于最近复航。上海市私营轮船业有五分之四的船只，在解放前夕遭匪帮抢劫破坏；解放后，又因蒋匪的封锁、轰炸，以致处于暂时的严重困难的境况中。国营轮船总公司执行了公私兼顾的政策，尽力予以扶持，一年来曾将承运物资的百分之三十四左右分配给私营轮船装运，使大部私营轮船已获得复航。但仍有万余吨私营轮船，因缺乏货源、燃料和开航费用，处于停航状态中。为此，国营轮船总公司除将承包的大批粮运、煤运等分配给私营轮船承运，帮助它们解决下水货源外，并对有特殊困难的私营轮船公司分别以承租、代理、预付运费、贷给燃料等方式，予以帮助，如先贷给大达大通联营处、拖驳联营处等十一艘船只的运费即有四亿四千五百万元，另有柴油三十三吨，燃煤一千五百余吨。
