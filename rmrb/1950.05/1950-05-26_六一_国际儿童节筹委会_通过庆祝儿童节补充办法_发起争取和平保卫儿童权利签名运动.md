　　[Our Newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the All-China "June 1" International Children's Day held its second meeting on the afternoon of May 24th. The meeting was presided over by Kang Keqing, Director of the Children's Welfare Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and passed the following supplementary measures for celebrating "June 1" International Children's Day throughout the country:
    (1) In order to respond to the appeal of the International Preparatory Committee for "June 1" International Children's Day for striving for lasting world peace and defending children's rights, a signature campaign is hereby launched. The text on the signature books can be determined by various regions themselves, in accordance with the spirit of the appeal from the International Preparatory Committee and the reply telegram from the National Preparatory Committee, and based on local conditions. The method is to first urge respected and representative figures in various regions to sign, and then launch a broad signature campaign among organized mothers and in various mass organizations. For the general dispersed residents, if they voluntarily sign, they should also be given the opportunity to sign. Please report the number of signatures to the National "June 1" Preparatory Committee by mid-June.
    (2) The content of the Children's Day commemorative meeting's publicity and the methods and means of holding the meeting should be specifically stipulated according to the intelligence and physical strength of the children in various places, and do not copy the content and methods of adult gatherings. The slogans and catchphrases at the meeting will not be uniformly stipulated, and each region can determine them according to local conditions if they deem it necessary, but they must be suitable for children's spoken language, and be short and easy to use.
    (3) During the celebration of International Children's Day, special attention should be paid to children's health and safety. The celebration meeting, as per the previous notice, should be mainly decentralized, so as to avoid children walking too much, becoming too tired, or spreading diseases. In large cities, if there are city-wide representative celebrations for older children (over nine years old), attention must be paid to the safety and sanitary facilities of the venue, as well as the transportation conditions outside the venue.

　　“六一”国际儿童节筹委会
    通过庆祝儿童节补充办法
    发起争取和平保卫儿童权利签名运动
    【本报讯】中华全国“六一”国际儿童节筹备委员会于五月二十四日下午举行第二次会议，会议由全国民主妇联儿童福利部部长康克清主持，通过全国各地庆祝“六一”国际儿童节的补充办法如下：
    （一）为了响应“六一”国际儿童节国际筹备委员会争取世界持久和平、保卫儿童权利的呼吁书，特发起签名运动。签名册上的文字，各地可依照国际筹委会的呼吁书及全国筹委会的复电上的精神，根据当地情况自定。其办法是首先敦促各地有声望和有代表性的人物签名，其次在有组织的母亲们中间及在各群众团体中，发动广泛的签名。对于一般的分散的居民，如果他们自愿签名，也应给以签名的机会，务请各地将签名人数于六月中旬报告全国“六一”筹备会。
    （二）关于儿童节纪念会的宣传内容，开会的方式方法，应根据各地儿童的智力和体力情况，具体规定，不要抄袭成人集会的内容和办法。集会上的标语口号不做统一规定，各地区如认为需要，可根据当地情况自定，但务须适合儿童口语，简短易行。
    （三）在庆祝国际儿童节的期间要特别注意儿童的健康和安全问题。庆祝会照前次通知，以分散举行为主，以免儿童走路太多，过于疲劳或传染疾病。在大城市中，如有全市代表性的年龄较大儿童（九岁以上）的庆祝会，必须注意会场的安全与卫生设备及会外的交通条件等。
