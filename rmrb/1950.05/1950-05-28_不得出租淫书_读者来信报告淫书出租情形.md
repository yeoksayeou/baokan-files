　　Pornographic Books Must Not Be Rented Out
    Reader's Letter Reports on Rental of Pornographic Books To the Editor:
    I happened to see a female student in my compound reading an extremely obscene novel. She said she rented it from a rental bookstore and that most of her classmates were reading these kinds of novels. So, I spent a month investigating this matter.
    The "Fu Lai Rental Bookstore" in Dongdan is the main base for renting and distributing these books. The authors of these books often change their pen names, but they mostly use "Xiao Sheng," "Mo An," "Yi Si Louzhu," "Leng Ru Yan," and "Bai Yun." This bookstore publishes about a hundred different kinds of these books. And "Fu Lai Rental Bookstore" alone rents out more than three hundred copies of these pornographic books every day. The readers are mostly male and female middle school students aged seventeen or eighteen. In addition, the rental stalls near Xidan Shopping Center and the YMCA in Dongcheng also rent out more than a hundred copies every day. This type of book is very harmful to young people. A few months ago, the No. 1 Branch Bureau inspected the "Fu Lai Rental Bookstore" and found many of these pornographic books. But I don't know why they were not ordered to stop operating. I hope the Public Security Bureau will quickly and thoroughly eliminate the pornographic book dealers and give them appropriate punishment.

　　不得出租淫书
    读者来信报告淫书出租情形编辑同志：
    我偶然看到同院的一个女学生竟在看一种极其淫秽的小说。她说是从租书处租来的，并说大部分同学都在看这种小说。于是我便花了一个月的工夫，对这事做了一个调查。
    东单“福来租书社”是出租和发行这种书籍的大本营。著这种书的人笔名常常变换，大概以用“笑生”、“默庵”、“忆斯楼主”、“冷儒雁”、“白云”为最多。该社所出这种书籍约有百余种。而仅“福来租书社”一家，每日就租出这种淫书三百余册。读者大部分是十七、八岁的男女中学生。此外，西单商场和东城青年会附近的租书摊，每日也都租出百余册。此类书籍对青年的毒害作用很大。前几个月，内一分局曾经到“福来租书社”检查过一次，查出这等淫书不少。但不知道为什么不勒令其停止营业。希望公安局迅速彻底清除淫书贩子，并给他们适当的惩罚。
