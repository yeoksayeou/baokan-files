Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, May 18th: As a result of the active participation of workers in Wuhan in learning, their cultural and political level has been significantly improved. In addition to a portion of worker cadres and activists participating in studies at the Central China Workers' School, according to incomplete statistics, 33,000 workers from major public and private enterprises and industries have participated in workers' night schools, study groups, and literacy classes. Over 11,000 staff members in various public enterprises also regularly participate in organized learning. The workers studying at the Central China Workers' School have greatly improved their class consciousness after their studies. Among the first and second terms of students at the school, 49 workers joined the Chinese Communist Party and 350 workers joined the New Democratic Youth League during their studies. Many other students have been promoted to administrative and trade union cadres. General students are also able to play an active and leading role in production and trade union work. Workers participating in workers' night schools, literacy classes, and study groups have greatly improved culturally and politically. For example, illiterate workers at the Jiji Power Plant, after three to four months of study, the fastest learners have learned more than 400 characters, and the average learners have learned 100 to 300 characters. With the general improvement of workers' cultural and political level, workers' cultural and recreational activities have also greatly developed. Clubs, wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and quick reports are almost universal in factories and enterprises. Workers have created nearly 100 kinds of scripts and quick reports. There are more than 180 worker correspondence groups in larger public and private factories, enterprises, and industries in the city. The Central China Worker's Daily received a total of 1,380 articles from workers in March.

　　武汉三万余职工入夜校  文化政治水平显著提高
    【新华社汉口十八日电】武汉市职工积极参加学习的结果，文化政治水平已有显著提高。全市除一部分职工干部及积极分子参加华中工人学校学习外，据不完全统计，已有主要公私营企业和行业的三万三千工人参加了工人夜校、学习小组和识字班，各公营企业中亦有一万一千余职员经常参加有组织的学习。华中工人学校学习的职工，经学习后，阶级觉悟大大提高。该校第一、二两期学员中，有四十九个职工在学习期间参加了中国共产党，三百五十个职工参加了新民主主义青年团。另有不少学员被提拔为行政和工会干部。一般学员亦都能在生产和工会工作中起积极和带头作用。参加工人夜校、识字班、学习小组学习的职工，在文化、政治上都得到很大提高。如既济水电厂的文盲工人，经过三四个月的学习，进度最快的已学会四百多字，一般的也学会了一百到三百个字。随着职工文化政治水平的普遍提高，职工文化娱乐工作也大有开展。俱乐部、壁报、黑板报、快报几乎普及各个工厂和企业。工人创作的剧本、快报将近一百多种。全市较大的公私营工厂、企业和行业中，有一百八十多个职工通讯组，华中工人报三月份即收到职工来稿共一千三百八十篇。
