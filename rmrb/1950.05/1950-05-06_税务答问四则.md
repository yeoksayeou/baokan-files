　　Four Tax Questions and Answers
　　(1) Question: Should soldiers who use human and animal power to transport coal for coal mines in their spare time pay production income tax? (He Bin)
　　Answer: Those who simply transport coal for mining bureaus with human or animal power without any commercial organization, only collecting porterage fees, are not subject to industrial and commercial tax; if they also engage in buying and selling, they should be taxed according to regulations.
　　(2) Question: What is the minimum distribution volume of kerosene? (Ni Jiefu)
　　Answer: The minimum distribution volume of kerosene is ten small barrels or more (including ten small barrels). A distribution permit should be obtained. For less than ten small barrels, the tax ticket number should be indicated on the shipping invoice for transport.
　　(3) Question: Is homespun cloth taxable? (Shi Qian)
　　Answer: Cloth woven with both warp and weft made of homespun yarn (hand-spun yarn) is exempt from tax. Cloth woven with a mixture of hand-spun yarn and machine-spun yarn is still taxable. However, socks and towels made of homespun yarn are still taxable.
　　(4) Question: What is the difference between the tax payment of a branch sales department and the head office? (Zhang Zhensheng, Shanghai)
　　Answer: Branches established separately in other locations or in the location of the head office should also pay industrial and commercial tax locally according to regulations.
