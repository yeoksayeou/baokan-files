Lack of Vision in Management, Blind Expansion of Production
	Tongchuan Coal Mine in a State of Paralysis
[This newspaper dispatch] The Tongchuan Coal Mine in central Shaanxi has fallen into a state of paralysis. This is the result of the mine's lack of vision and planning in its operations, its blind expansion of production, and its poor management. The state-owned Tongchuan Coal Mine has now shrunk to a very small scale, and the largest private mine, Xinyu Coal Mining Company, has declared bankruptcy. The government, banks, and trade departments are reviewing and summarizing lessons learned because they blindly supported the mine and caused huge losses to the country.
	The Tongchuan Coal Mine was jointly established by the pseudo-Shaanxi Provincial Government and the Longhai Railway Bureau in 1941. The coal contains a lot of sulfur and the ash content accounts for 20%; the coal seam is also thin. At that time, the Longhai Railway was interrupted, and coal from Hebei and Henan could not be transported to the west. The Tongguan-Baoji section of the Longhai Railway needed coal; in addition, the Kuomintang reactionaries laid the Xianyang-Tongchuan branch line of the Longhai Railway to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, taking advantage of the road to transport coal. Therefore, instead of opening good mines in Baishui and Hancheng, they opened this inferior mine. In the next few years, private mines also started operating one after another. At that time, most of the coal used by factories and civilians in Guanzhong was supplied by this mine, so there was no problem with sales. From the liberation of Xi'an in May last year to the opening of the Longhai Railway in November, the Xian-Tong line was intermittently open due to the war, and there was a serious coal shortage in the Xi'an and Xianyang areas. Various organizations, enterprises, and citizens competed to buy and store coal, and private merchants also scrambled to hoard and profit, and coal prices rose sharply for a time. Tongchuan coal was sold at a lower price (because the price of wheat in Tongchuan was particularly low at that time), which made it even more in short supply. Under these circumstances, it was right for the government to give the mine some appropriate and necessary support to enable it to supply the needs of industry and the market. However, the enterprise leadership at that time did not pay attention to analyzing the situation, ignored the temporary nature of this situation, and did not realize that once the Longhai Railway was opened, high-quality and low-priced coal from Hebei and Henan would inevitably be transported westward and occupy the main market. They blindly used too much effort in the mine, and the bank and the government successively lent the state-owned mine grain funds equivalent to more than one million catties of wheat, and lent the private Xinyu Coal Mine grain funds equivalent to more than 1.5 million catties of wheat. The number of workers in the state-owned mine increased from 800 or 900 to 3,515. The number of workers in the private Xinyu increased from more than 600 to 1,384 (excluding employees and odd-job workers). At that time, because the profits were very high, no one paid attention to improving business management, and the phenomenon of extravagance and waste became more and more serious. In the state-owned mine, the loss rate of large pieces of coal from the mine to the station (using manpower) reached 40% (turning into coal powder). The mine did not store grain well, and 320,000 catties of moldy wheat were lost. In addition, more than 130,000 catties could not be recovered after being purchased, and money was wasted. The person in charge simply could not figure out the number of assets and personnel. There were many similar situations in private mines. In this way, production expanded, but costs increased and coal quality decreased (more stones in the coal). However, because there was no competition at that time, no one was vigilant (the state-owned and private mines produced a total of 40,000 tons per month at the peak, and all of them could be sold).
	In November, the Longhai Railway opened, and eastern coal was transported westward in large quantities. The large coal users in the Xi'an area (factories, etc.) had already stored too much coal (the coal stored by each unit plus the coal stored in the mine was enough for the whole year of 1950). The mine still did not pay attention to this new situation. The state-owned mine and Xinyu each opened a new well and a flour mill. Xinyu also spent huge sums of money to buy cars and build bathhouses. By December, sales had plummeted by nine-tenths, and almost nothing could be sold. Before the Longhai Railway opened, the Tongchuan state-owned mine's biggest customer was the railway, which used 80% of the mine's total coal production. At this time, the railway completely switched to using Fengfeng coal (the railway bureau did not notify the mine in advance to prepare, which was also a mistake). More than a dozen small mines closed because most people did not come to buy coal. The state-owned and large mines were hopelessly waiting for the situation to improve. They did not shrink or streamline, and dragged on until March of this year. The state-owned mine paid more than 3,000 people's salaries for three or four months in vain, and got more unsold coal. The grain funds owed to the government, banks, and trade departments could not be repaid. Xinyu owed wages equivalent to more than 2 million catties of wheat. The workers complained. Instigated by saboteurs, they turned their anger on the People's Government and the trade company, causing blind disturbances and affecting the government's prestige. It was not until the president of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Court led a work group of more than 20 people from relevant agencies to explain and persuade for more than 20 days that the situation was calmed down. And a solution was agreed upon: all arrears of wages below 400 catties will be paid in full, and those above 400 catties will be paid 400 catties per person, and the rest will be compensated by discounting the mine's assets and coal in stock. The bankruptcy was formally declared. The grain funds owed to the public will be compensated by discounting part of the mine and some shares in the flour mill. But since the coal mine collapsed, the sales of flour are also limited. It is difficult to calculate the losses suffered by the public due to the backlog of funds. The state-owned mine is now doing its best to streamline and shrink. It plans to reduce the monthly output from 18,000 tons to 5,000 tons (for nearby retail sales), and the number of personnel will be reduced to about 900 (a reduction of about three-quarters). If necessary, it will be transferred to the local government or private management, or completely shut down. The technical personnel will be transferred to other places for use, and the general personnel will be organized to change jobs or return home to produce. (Lin Wei)

### 经营缺乏远见  盲目扩大生产  铜川煤矿陷瘫痪状态

　　经营缺乏远见  盲目扩大生产
    铜川煤矿陷瘫痪状态
    【本报讯】陕西中部的铜川煤矿已陷于瘫痪状态。这是该矿在经营上缺乏远见与计划性，盲目地扩大生产和管理不善的结果。其中公营的铜川煤矿现收缩至极小规模，私营中最大的新裕煤矿公司已宣告破产。政府与银行、贸易部门因盲目扶植该矿，使国家蒙受了巨大损失，正在检讨与总结教训。
    铜川煤矿是伪陕西省府于一九四一年和陇海铁路局合作创建的。煤中含硫磺质很多，灰分占百分之二十；煤层也薄。当时陇海路中断，冀、豫煤不能西运，陇海路潼（关）宝（鸡）段需煤无着；加上国民党反动派为进攻陕甘宁边区而铺了陇海路咸（阳）铜（川）支线，有借路运煤之便，于是不开白水、韩城之好矿而开了这个劣矿。此后数年间，私矿也纷纷开办起来。当时关中的工厂与民用燃煤，绝大部分靠该矿供给，故销路不成问题。去年五月西安解放到十一月陇海通车之前，咸铜线因战争关系时通时断，西安、咸阳一带煤荒严重。各机关、企业与市民争着买煤存储，私商也争相囤积牟利，一时煤价奇涨。铜川煤售价较低（因当时铜川麦价特低），更感供不应求。在此情形下，政府给该矿以某些适当的必要的扶持，使能供应工业与市场需要，是应该的。但当时企业领导机关没有注意分析情况，忽略了这种情况的暂时性，不认识一旦陇海路通，质好价廉之冀豫煤必然西运，占领主要市场。他们盲目地在该矿使用了太大的力量，先后经银行和政府借给公矿粮款折小麦一百万斤以上，借给私营新裕煤矿粮款折小麦一百五十多万斤。公矿工人由八、九百人增到三千五百一十五人。私营新裕工人由六百多人增到一千三百八十四人（职员、杂工在外）。当时因获利很大，谁都不注意改善经营管理，铺张浪费现象日甚一日。公矿中的大炭从矿上运到车站（用人力），损耗率达百分之四十（变成了煤粉）。矿方存粮保管不好，霉麦达三十二万斤。另有十三万多斤是买下收不回来，白花了钱。资产与人员数目，负责人根本摸不清。私矿中也有许多类似情形。这样，生产扩大了，成本反见增高，煤质反见降低（煤中石块增多）。但因当时无人竞争，都不警惕（最盛时期公私矿月产共四万吨，均能售出）。
    十一月份，陇海路通了，东煤源源西运。西安一带的大用煤户（工厂等），又早已存煤太多（各单位存煤加上矿上存煤，已够一九五○年全年所需）。对此新的情况，该矿仍不注意。公矿与新裕并又各开新井一个，面粉厂一座。新裕还花费巨款买汽车、修澡塘。到了十二月份，销路即骤减十分之九，几乎一点卖不动了。陇海路以前是铜川公矿的最大主顾，用该矿全部产煤十分之八，此时全部改用峰峰煤（路局事先未通知该矿早做准备，也有错误）。小矿因大部群众不来购买，十多家关门了。公矿、大矿则在无望地等待情况好转。不收缩也不精简，直拖到今年三月。公矿白付出三千多人，三、四两个月的工资，所得是更多的销不掉的存煤。所欠政府与银行、贸易部门粮款，均已无法偿付。新裕则拖欠工资折小麦二百多万斤。工人怨声载道。又受破坏分子挑拨，转怒于人民政府、贸易公司，引起盲目的骚动，使政府威信受到影响。直至陕西省人民法院院长率领有关机关二十多人的工作团前去进行了二十来天的解释、劝导，才平息下来。并商定解决办法：积欠工资四百斤以下的全发，四百斤以上的每人发四百斤，其余将矿上资产与存煤折价偿还。正式宣告破产。所欠公家粮款，将矿厂一部与面粉厂若干股份折价偿还。但煤矿既垮，面粉亦销路有限。公家因积压资金所受损失，是很难计算的。公矿方面，现正全力实行精简收缩。准备将月产量由一万八千吨减至五千吨（供附近零售），人员减至九百左右（约减四分之三）。必要时转给当地政府或私人经营，或彻底停办。将技术人员移至别处使用，一般人员组织转业或回家生产。（林韦）
