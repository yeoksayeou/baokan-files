Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 18th: TASS reports: On July 17th, the people of Moscow celebrated the annual Soviet holiday – Stalin Aviation Day.

A grand air force review was held at the Tushino Airport of the Soviet Chkalov Central Aviation Club. Buses, trams, and trains carried hundreds of thousands of Muscovites to Tushino, and crowds of people gathered in the vast airport. On this bright morning, the people of Moscow, dressed in various summer clothes, made the airport look very beautiful.

When Marshal Stalin and his comrades – members of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee, Soviet government officials, and Marshals of the Soviet Union – arrived, thunderous cheers resounded throughout the area. The entire development of the Soviet Air Force and all the achievements in creating the best aircraft in the world are inextricably linked with the name of Stalin. That is why the Soviet people call their air force the Stalin Air Force and their pilots the Stalin Eagles.

At noon, loud bugle calls and a twenty-gun salute from one hundred cannons simultaneously announced the start of the review. The sounds of the Soviet national anthem echoed through the airport. At this moment, the sound of approaching aircraft could be heard. Formations of aircraft flew in, passing over the airport. The first aircraft carried a huge portrait of Stalin fluttering in the wind, followed by aircraft carrying the flags of the sixteen Union Republics and the light blue Air Force flag.

Everyone gazed at the sky. A squadron of small planes appeared in the distance, gradually approaching. As they flew over the airport, they formed the words "Glory to Stalin." The skilled techniques and orderly flight of the Moscow Aviation Club pilots earned universal praise. Subsequently, five aircraft piloted by female pilots appeared over the airport, performing various and ever-changing flight maneuvers. This squadron was led by Soviet Hero Marina Chechneva. Following these skilled female pilots was a team of twenty-four "Yak-18" aircraft led by the technically outstanding aviator Yakov Forostenko. These performers were all workers, foremen, and engineers. They performed complex formation flying. After them was a team of gliders piloted by female pilots, led by the oldest female glider pilot in the Soviet Union, Magalia Darachinskaya. In their silent, bird-like gliders, they brilliantly repeated everything the aircraft had just performed minutes before, and the audience rewarded them with stormy applause. At this point, Petrov, a pilot from the Central Aviation Club, flew around the airport in a new tailless glider designed by Cheranovsky, performing somersaults.

The second part of the air force review was the military aircraft performance. Air Force pilots flew jet aircraft created by the famous Soviet designers Yakovlev, Lavochkin, and Mikoyan, performing all the most complex flight techniques.

Hundreds of thousands of eyes watched with utmost attention, amazed at the flawless flight techniques of these performers. Major Yevgeny Piplyayev, flying a Lavochkin-designed jet aircraft, displayed unparalleled personal skill. A squadron of fighter planes commanded by Captain Badayev performed a thrilling dive, earning loud cheers. Behind them were five aircraft, followed by nine fast aircraft, whose skilled pilots performed a brilliant formation flight.

Soviet pilots were the first in the world to master formation flying with jet aircraft, and today, they have completed a miracle, demonstrating a high level of technical skill and mastery of the most complex techniques. Every maneuver was performed with extreme precision, and the audience wholeheartedly applauded these masters of the sky.

The second part of the performance culminated in a mock air battle. Anti-aircraft guns thundered, and "hit" bombers crashed, emitting trails of black smoke. Then, squadrons of bombers, stormoviks, and fast jet fighters filled the sky. The entire audience watched with pride these super-aircraft created by the Soviet people.

The third part of the performance was parachuting. The Soviet Union is the birthplace of parachute sports, which cultivate courage, will, determination, and bravery. Parachutists jumping from aircraft flying upside down aroused enthusiastic cheers. Among the parachutists landing were the famous athletes – the Miznikov father and son. Shiny silver-gray transport aircraft, row after row, swept across the sky, leaving behind a series of open, bright parachutes. They lined up one after another, each row with its own color – red, blue, and green. Hundreds of parachutists filled the sky. Multi-colored dome-like objects covered the airport grounds. The flight of high-speed jet aircraft brought the performance to its climax.

The air force performance on July 17th was proof of the power of the Stalinist Air Force. Moreover, it aroused justifiable pride in the hearts of hundreds of thousands of Soviet patriots and a warm sense of gratitude to Stalin, the creator of the Soviet Union’s powerful air force.

    斯大林主义空军威力的证明
    苏京欢庆空军节
    斯大林亲临检阅
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社报道：七月十七日，莫斯科人民庆祝了苏联人民一年一度的节日——斯大林空军节。
    在苏联契卡洛夫中央航空俱乐部的图希诺机场上，举行了盛大的空军检阅。公共汽车、电车和火车，把数十万莫斯科人民载到图希诺，一簇簇的人群就云集在那里的巨大机场上。当此明媚的清晨，莫斯科人民穿戴着各色各样的夏日的服饰，使得机场显得非常美丽。
    当斯大林大元帅及其战友——联共中央政治局委员、苏联政府官员、苏联元帅们——到场时，春雷般的欢呼声响澈四方。苏联空军的全部发展与在创造世界上最良好的飞机上所取得的一切成就，都是与斯大林的名字不可分地联结在一起，这就是苏联人民何以把他们的空军称为斯大林空军，把他们的飞行员称为斯大林之鹰的原因。
    正午，响亮的喇叭声和一百尊炮所同时发出的二十响礼炮，报告了检阅的开始。苏联国歌的鸣奏声响澈着机场。此时，飞机渐渐迫近，机声可闻。结成队形的机队排空而来，飞临机场上空，头一架飞机上，巨幅的斯大林肖像随风飘动着，那些扬着十六个加盟共和国国旗与浅蓝色空军军旗的飞机则尾随其后。
    人们均凝视天空，一队小飞机在远方出现，渐渐迫近，当它们飞临机场上空时，即组成“光荣归于斯大林”的字样。莫斯科航空俱乐部驾驶员们熟练的技艺与井然有序的飞行，博得人们普遍的赞美。其后，由女飞行员驾驶的五架飞机出现于机场上空，表演各种变化多端的飞行技巧。这一队飞机由苏联英雄马丽娜·切契涅娃率领，在这些技艺娴熟的女飞行员之后的，是由技术卓越的航空员雅科夫·福罗斯庭科所率领的二十四架“雅克——一八”式飞机队。这些表演者都是工人、领班和工程师。他们表演着复杂的编队飞行。其后是苏联最老的女滑翔机驾驶员马嘉丽搭拉清斯卡雅率领的一队由女驾驶员驾驶的滑翔机。她们在那无声的鸟般的滑翔机上，辉煌地反复着飞机在数分钟前所刚刚表演的一切，观客们向她们报之以暴风雨般的鼓掌。至此，中央航空俱乐部驾驶员彼得罗夫驾驶着车兰诺夫斯基所设计的新型无尾滑翔机环绕机场上空飞行，并表演翻筋斗。
    空军检阅的第二部分，是军用飞机的表演。空军飞行员驾驶着闻名的苏联设计家雅科夫列夫、拉伏契金与米高扬所创造的喷气式飞机，表演了一切最复杂的飞行技术。
    数十万只眼睛都以无限的注意观看着，对这些表演的飞行技术之毫无瑕疵，感到惊奇。叶夫杰尼·皮皮利亚耶夫少校驾驶着拉伏契金设计的喷气式飞机，其个人表演技术之高超是无与伦比的。由巴达耶夫上尉统率的战斗机大队，作了惊心动魄的俯冲表演，博得高声的喝采。它们的后面是五架飞机，再后是九架快速飞机，其熟练的驾驶员作了编队飞行的辉煌表演。
    苏联飞行员是世界上最先精通喷气式飞机的编队飞行的，而今天，他们完成了奇迹，表现着高度的技术水平及对最复杂技术的精通。每一种操演都表演得极度精确，观众们由衷地对这些天空的支配者报以应得的鼓掌。
    表演的第二部分以假想空战为顶点。高射炮雷鸣着，“被击中”的轰炸机坠下，冒出一道一道的黑烟。其后，轰炸机、暴风雨式机与快速喷气战斗机等大队满布天空。全场观众皆以得意的眼光观看着苏维埃人民创造的这些超级飞机。
    表演的第三部分是跳伞。苏联是降落伞体育的诞生地，这种体育培养着胆量、意志、决心与勇敢。跳伞者从机底朝天飞行的飞机中跳伞，引起了热烈的喝采。落地的跳伞者当中有闻名的运动家——米兹尼科夫父子。发光的银灰色运输机，一排接着一排地掠过大地的上空，它们的后面留下一列一列的张开着的明亮的降落伞。它们一排接着一排，每一排都有其自己的颜色——红色、蓝色与绿色。天空中有数以百计的跳伞者。五颜六色的圆屋顶似的东西，覆盖着机场场地。高速喷气式机的飞翔，使表演达到了顶点。
    七月十七日的空军表演，是斯大林主义空军威力的证明。而且，这在数以十万计的苏联爱国者的心中激起了合理的自豪，及对苏维埃国度强大空军的缔造者斯大林的热烈的感激之情。
