　　Mr. Guo Moruo's Opening Address

　　Respected leaders, distinguished guests, fellow representatives!

　　The All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers, after three months of preparation, is officially opened today.

　　At this moment of announcing the opening, we must first pay our respects to the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao, pay our respects to the Communist Party of China, which wholeheartedly serves the Chinese people, pay our respects to the heroic People's Liberation Army, which will soon liberate all of China, and pay our respects to the diligent and heroic workers and peasants who are working hard to support the front lines!

　　Today, we are in a radiant and incomparably great new era of our Chinese people. Our entire Chinese people, after more than two thousand years of exploitation under the feudal system, more than one hundred years of imperialist aggression, and more than twenty years of control by the Kuomintang fascist regime, will soon be completely liberated.

　　In such a great era, we literary and art workers are convening this national congress in Beiping, the command center of the people's power. This is a major event of historical significance in the course of building a new democratic China.

　　What is the historical mission that the era has given us? It is to summarize past experiences, plan future strategies, and effectively use the powerful weapon of literature and art to enhance revolutionary combativeness and encourage production enthusiasm, so that the construction of new democracy can quickly achieve a comprehensive victory and steadily transition to a higher historical stage.

　　To fulfill this solemn historical mission is precisely the main task for us to convene this national congress today.

　　We deeply know that today is not a time for us to gloss over the reality. Our military victory is indeed incomparably great, but our enemies have not yet been completely eliminated.

　　We also deeply know that besides the visible enemies, there are more hidden and more stubborn invisible enemies. These invisible enemies not only surround us, but sometimes even lurk in our own hearts. These are the feudal ideas of more than two thousand years, the comprador consciousness of more than one hundred years, and the fascist bacteria of more than twenty years. We must also use all our strength to quickly, thoroughly, comprehensively, and cleanly eliminate these invisible enemies! The combat task of eliminating these invisible enemies falls, without a doubt, on the shoulders of us literary and art workers.

　　We are, in fact, a powerful field army on the cultural front. Since the May Fourth Movement, we have been engaged in arduous battles with all visible and invisible enemies. But in the past, we were divided by the reactionary regime, our strength was not easily concentrated, our command was not easily unified, and sometimes we even fought on our own. Many excellent combatants sacrificed in battle. But today, we are truly worthy of celebration, we are gathered in Beiping under the victorious banner of Chairman Mao. Here, there are the steel troops from the old liberated areas, and the guerrilla troops from the new liberated areas and the areas awaiting liberation. We are, in fact, shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand, closely united. We hope that our unity will be further expanded and consolidated. We must not only unite ourselves, but also unite the people, and unite the new China into the strongest fortress of peace.

　　What is especially worthy of our celebration is that in May 1942, seven years ago, Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art gave us clear instructions. The principled instructions in this speech have always been a universal and appropriate truth. Today, we should clearly express: We must unanimously accept Chairman Mao's instructions and take this universal and appropriate truth as the general indicator of our future literary and artistic movement.

　　The work we should do is complex and extensive. In the future, under the protection of the people's regime, we literary and artistic workers will not worry about "having no place to use our talents," but only worry about "having heroes but no place to use them." The broad masses of the people are eagerly awaiting our spiritual food. The friends in the old liberated areas, under the direct guidance of Chairman Mao, have created many brilliant examples, but compared to the massive needs of the broad masses, it is still very limited. The contributions of the friends in the new liberated areas and the areas awaiting liberation are even less, needless to say, due to the limitations of objective conditions. We must never be satisfied with our existing achievements, nor should we be discouraged by our lack of achievements. As long as we are willing to make up our minds today to be students of Mao Zedong, and under the protection of the people's regime, with full freedom of creation, we will definitely be able to catch up and meet the needs of the broad masses of the people.

　　We must especially learn from the workers and peasants, especially the working class. We must establish close and organic connections with the feelings, reason, and will of the workers and peasants, and then we can understand the workers and peasants, represent the workers and peasants, and further educate the workers and peasants. We must first educate ourselves well, and then we can educate others. We must first shape our own souls well, and then we can shape the souls of others. We must create new forms, new beauty, that are adapted to revolutionary consciousness, morality, and qualities. We must experience and praise the proletariat's patriotism, and we must experience and praise the proletariat's internationalism. We must, under these two profound experiences, critically develop all the progressive and excellent traditions of the past, and absorb the valuable experiences of advanced fraternal nations.

　　The historical mission that the era has given us is indeed very significant and solemn. We must use collective strength to discuss and study together, in order to obtain perfect steps to complete the mission, to jointly abide by, jointly promote, and jointly call for. A new general organization that matches the new era is also necessary. How to organize it must also be discussed by us at length. In addition to this, there are many detailed reports and thorough proposals at the conference. From these reports and proposals, we carefully analyze and synthesize, and we believe that we can definitely draw very valuable conclusions.

　　The conference is expected to continue for twelve full days from today. During this sufficient time, relying on the efforts of all the representatives, we believe that we can definitely make the conference a success, and make all of us literary and art workers not only not disappoint the mission given to us by the era, but also provide a good demonstration for the brotherly troops on the cultural front.

　　Finally, let me make another loud call:

　　All progressive literary and art workers, unite!

　　Accept Chairman Mao's instructions and create literature and art that serve the people!

　　Attack and eliminate all visible and invisible enemies, and make the construction of new democracy achieve a comprehensive victory!

### 郭沫若先生开幕辞

　　郭沫若先生开幕辞
    各位首长，各位来宾，各位代表！
    中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会，经过了三个月的筹备，今天正式开幕了。
    我们在宣告开幕的这一瞬间，首先要向伟大的人民领袖毛主席致敬，向全心全意为中国人民服务的中国共产党致敬，向英勇作战不久便要解放全中国的人民解放军致敬，向努力生产支援前线全体勤劳英勇的工农大众致敬！
    我们今天是处在我们中国人民的一个光芒万丈、伟大无比的新时代。我们全中国的人民，在两千多年来的封建制度的剥削之下，在一百多年来的帝国主义的侵略之下，在二十多年来的国民党法西斯政权的控制之下，不久便要彻底翻身了。
    处在这样一个伟大的时代，我们从事于文学艺术的工作者们，在人民政权的司令台——北平，来召开这次全国性的代表大会，这在建设新民主主义的新中国的历程上，是富有历史意义的一件大事。
    时代所给予我们的历史使命是什么呢？是要我们总结以往的经验，策划未来的方略，把文学艺术这项有力的武器，有效地运用来提高革命的敌忾，鼓励生产的热情，使新民主主义的建设迅速地得到全面胜利，稳步地过渡到更高的历史阶段。
    为了完成这项庄严的历史使命，正是我们今天来召开这次全国代表大会的主要的任务。
    我们深切地知道，在今天并不是让我们来粉饰太平的时候，我们的军事胜利诚然是伟大无比的，但我们的敌人还未彻底消灭。
    我们也深切地知道，在有形的敌人之外，还有更隐蔽更顽强的无形的敌人。这些无形的敌人不仅环绕在我们的周围，有时甚至还潜伏在我们自己的心里。这便是两千多年来的封建思想，一百多年来的买办意识，二十多年来的法西斯细菌。这些无形的敌人我们也须得用全力来迅速、彻底、全面、干净地把它们消灭！消灭这些无形敌人的战斗任务，责无旁贷地，是落在我们文学艺术工作者的肩头上来了。
    我们，事实上是文化战线上的一支有力的野战军。自“五四”以来，我们一直在和一切有形无形的敌人作着艰苦的战斗。但在以前我们被反动政权分割着，力量不容易集中，指挥不容易统一，有时更甚至是人自为战，有不少的优秀的战斗员是在战斗上牺牲了。可是我们今天，实在是很值得庆贺，我们是集中在毛主席的胜利的旗帜之下，会师北平了。在这儿有老解放区的钢铁部队，有新解放区和待解放区的游击部队，我们事实上是肩并肩手挽手地，紧紧团结起来了。我们的团结希望更加扩大，更加巩固，不仅要团结自己，还要团结人民，把新中国团结成一个最坚强的和平堡垒。
    在我们尤其值得庆贺的，是在七年前的一九四二年五月，毛主席在延安文艺座谈会的讲话，已经给予了我们明确的指示。这个讲话里的原则性的指示一直是普遍而妥当的真理。在今天我们应该明朗地表示：我们要一致接受毛主席的指示，把这一普遍而妥当的真理作为我们今后的文艺运动的总指标。
    我们应该做的工作是千头万绪的，在今后人民政权的保护之下，我们文艺工作者不会愁“英雄无用武之地”，只会愁“地无用武之英雄”了。广大的人民大众很迫切地期待着我们的精神食粮。老解放区的朋友们在毛主席的直接指导之下，曾经创造了不少的光辉的范例，但比较起广大群众的大量需要来，实在还是非常有限的。新解放区和待解放区的朋友们的贡献，受着客观条件的限制，不用说更是不多。我们决不要以既有的成就而满足，我们也不要以它无成就而气馁，只要我们今天肯下决心做毛泽东的学生，在人民政权的保护之下，创作有充分的自由，我们一定可以迎头赶上，满足人民大众的需要的。
    我们对于工农大众，尤其工人阶级，是要特别学习的。我们要和工农大众的感情，理智，意志发生密切的有机的联系，然后才能够了解工农，表现工农，更进而教育工农。必须先教育好自己，然后才能教育别人。必须先塑造好自己的灵魂，然后才能塑造别人的灵魂。我们要创造适应于革命意识、道德、品质的新的形式，新的美。我们必须体验并表扬无产阶级的爱国主义，我们必须体验并表扬无产阶级的国际主义。我们必须在这两种深切的体验之下，批判地发展过去的一切进步优秀的传统，而吸收先进的兄弟民族的宝贵经验。
    时代所给予我们的历史使命的确是很重大而庄严的，我们必须用集体的力量来共同讨论，共同研究，以期获得一个完善的完成使命的步骤，来共同遵守，共同推进，共同号召。和新时代相配合的新的总机构也是必要的，怎样来加以组织，也须得我们从长商议。在这之外在大会上还有很多详细的报告，周密的提案，我们从这些报告和提案中，细心地分析和综合，我们相信一定更可以得出很可宝贵的结论的。
    大会从今天起预计要整整继续十二天，在这充分的时间当中，靠着全体代表们的努力，我们相信一定可以使大会顺利地获得成功，并使我们全体文艺工作者不仅不至于辜负时代所给予我们的使命，而且对于文化战线的兄弟部队会提出一个良好的示范。
    最后让我再作一次高呼：
    一切进步的文学艺术工作者团结起来！
    接受毛主席的指示，创造为人民服务的文艺！
    打击并消灭一切有形无形的敌人，使新民主主义的建设获得全面胜利！
