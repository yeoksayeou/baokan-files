　　Formulate Unified Standards and Implement Responsibility System
  　National Machinery Affairs Conference Victoriously Concludes
    Minister Teng Calls for Expanding the Existing Railways Tenfold
    [Report from this newspaper] The National Machinery Affairs Conference held a general summary on July 10th and announced its successful conclusion. In the morning of the 10th, Ma Jun, Director of the Machinery Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, gave a summary of machinery affairs work. In the afternoon, Lu Zhengcao, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Railways, made a concluding speech. Finally, Minister Teng Daiyuan gave work instructions. At 7:00 PM, a grand ceremony was held to award prizes and grant engineer degrees.
    In the morning, Director Ma Jun summarized the machinery affairs work. When discussing the responsibility system, he said: This is precisely two different methods of managing railways under two different social systems. The Communist Party relies on the working class to implement the responsibility system, and its foundation is built on the class consciousness of the working masses. The workers truly realize that they have become the masters of the railways. For example, in Northeast China, the average daily kilometers per locomotive in 1947 was 171.4, while in 1949 the average reached 319.1. Because of the implementation of the responsibility system, workers realized their responsibility as masters, realized that workers manage machines, and machines are tools for the working class to serve the people. Therefore, they will inevitably cherish their tools and try to maintain and increase the effectiveness of the machines. In terms of leadership, it is to expand the technical scope of workers as much as possible, improve their technical level, and rely on the efforts of the masses of workers in all aspects to do their work well, so efficiency can only increase. The Kuomintang's management of railways cannot rely on workers at all. Machines are only tools for exploiting workers. In the production process, workers are only entrusted with very small and local work and can only remain ignorant for a long time, without any prospects for development. Therefore, it is impossible for them to be actively responsible for their work, and efficiency cannot be improved. These two systems are in stark contrast, and the resulting efficiency is also a very clear contrast.
    In addition, he also proposed clear tasks, clear division of responsibilities, and clear work efficiency and other standards as three indispensable conditions for the implementation of the responsibility system. Regarding the issue of planning, he concluded: This conference resolved the problems of inconsistent standards and unclear tasks in the past. This time, preliminary standards and basic tasks were put forward. Minister Teng once instructed that the standards at this stage cannot remain unchanged and be applied for a long time, because the formulation of standards should change along with the progress of work and the achievements created by the efforts of the majority of employees. The conference made specific provisions on the percentage of national locomotive operation standards, the quality standards for locomotive maintenance this year, and the mileage between scheduled locomotive inspections. Regarding the basic tasks of machinery affairs work in the future, he pointed out: "It is to constantly improve the quality of locomotives and rolling stock, ensure transportation needs in a timely manner, avoid failures, never forget to improve the technical level of machinery affairs employees, adopt advanced machinery affairs management methods, increase efficiency, practice strict economy, and strive to gradually reduce transportation costs and prepare for future development."
    In the afternoon, Deputy Minister Lu summarized the speeches of the conference and criticized some old ideas and erroneous viewpoints. He pointed out that the main obstacles to the implementation of the responsibility system are conservatism and bureaucracy. Those who admire American imperialism and have slavish ideas should transform their thinking, develop the role of progressive elements, educate wavering elements, and transform backward elements in order to struggle for the restoration and construction of national railways.
    In his speech, Minister Teng called on the conference representatives to bring the instructions of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and central responsible comrades, as well as the new spirit of the conference, to the front line to take on new tasks and expand the existing 28,000 kilometers of railways tenfold. He also pointed out that Vice Chairman Zhou, on behalf of the Military Commission, pointed out the great achievements of the restoration of the people's railways, which is to encourage everyone to work hard in the future.
　　Six Heroic Models Awarded Medals
    Then, the award ceremony was held. Amidst military music, the two ministers personally presented medals. The recipients included Li Yong, driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive from the Pingjin Railway Bureau; Du Xianyang, driver of the "Iron Ox" locomotive from the Qiqihar Railway Bureau in Northeast China; Zhang Zhongye, driver of the "No. 884" locomotive from the Qiqihar Railway Bureau; Chen Zhijiu, director of the Meihekou Locomotive Depot Factory of the Jilin Railway Administration; and Su Yinsheng, driver of the "May Day Labor" locomotive from the Pingjin Railway Bureau. These five heroes were awarded the Labor Hero Medal. Yang Peilin of the Ningnian Typical Water Supply Station was awarded the Model Worker Medal.
    After the award ceremony, Minister Teng continued his speech amidst warm cheers and applause. He introduced that after the "Mao Zedong" locomotive arrived at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, under its influence and exemplary leadership, a new heroic locomotive, the "May Day Labor" locomotive, was cultivated. Minister Teng also called on all representatives of the railway bureaus to work hard, learn from the new labor models and heroes, and produce thousands upon thousands of more labor models and heroes to jointly build the people's railways better.
　　Li Yong Promoted to Section Chief Level Driver
  　Chen Zhijiu Awarded Engineer Position
    At the same time, Minister Teng announced that he, on behalf of the Ministry of Railways, officially appointed Comrade Li Yong, driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, to be promoted to section chief level driver, and awarded Comrade Chen Zhijiu the position of engineer. He pointed out that Comrade Chen Zhijiu is good at planning and organizing, and his talent is no less than that of an ordinary engineer. His personal rich practical experience even exceeds that of an ordinary engineer. For example, Comrade Chen Zhijiu transformed the non-standard locations of the boiler, chimney, and windbreak of the water supply station in Panshi Station, Northeast China. Even the Japanese engineers of the puppet Manchukuo era had studied this transformation but failed to solve it. Minister Teng said: These workers would not have been noticed under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang, only suffering the pain of being exploited and oppressed. But today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, they have been discovered, and typical heroes have emerged. Take Chen Zhijiu as a typical example to establish the banner of a new type of worker engineer, and call on all representatives to learn from and emulate heroes like Li Yong and Chen Zhijiu. He then announced the promotion of old engineer Chen Daxian (former head of the Inspection and Repair Section of the Pingjin Railway Bureau) to Deputy Director of the Machinery Affairs Department. Minister Teng pointed out that although Chen Daxian is an old engineer, he participated in this conference and accepted new ideas quickly. He also expressed his willingness to overcome those old ideas and old work styles and to learn from workers to seek transformation. This performance is precisely a path and direction for old engineers to transform themselves in the future. The old staff members of each railway bureau should emulate him. The conference declared its successful conclusion amidst warm applause and slogans, and the North China Film Studio filmed the event.

### 制定统一标准实行负责制　全国机务会议胜利闭幕  滕部长号召把现有铁道发展十倍

　　制定统一标准实行负责制
  　全国机务会议胜利闭幕
    滕部长号召把现有铁道发展十倍
    【本报讯】全国机务会议于七月十日进行大会总结并宣告胜利闭幕。十日上午由铁道部机务局局长马钧作机务工作总结，下午由铁道部吕副部长正操作大会总结，最后由滕部长代远作工作指示。晚上七时举行授奖、授工程师学位等隆重仪式。
    上午马钧局长总结机务工作，谈到负责制问题时，他说：这正是两种不同的社会制度的两种不同的管理铁路的办法。共产党依靠工人阶级去实行负责制，它的基础建立在工人群众的阶级觉悟上，工人真正体会到他们已成为铁路的主人。例如在东北一九四七年机车日车公里平均是一七一·四，到一九四九年平均数竟达三一九·一了。因为实行负责制，使工人认识到自己当主人的责任，认识到工人管理机器，机器是工人阶级服务人民的工具，因此他们必然要爱护自己的工具，设法保持增加机器的效用，在领导上是尽可能扩大工人技术范围，提高工人技术水平，靠工人大众一齐在各方面努力将工作作好，所以效率只有增长。国民党管理铁路是根本不能依赖工人的，机器只是剥削工人的工具，工人在生产过程中，只受托了很细小的局部工作，只能保持长期愚昧，无发展前途，所以也就不可能对工作积极负责，效率也就不能提高，这两种制度是鲜明的对比，产生的效率也是很显明的对比。
    此外他还提出任务明确，分工职责明确，工作效率及其他标准等明确，为实行负责制的三个决不可少的条件。关于计划问题，他总结出：这次会议解决了过去各路局标准不够统一、任务不够明确的毛病。这次提出了工作的初步标准和基本任务。滕部长曾指示现阶段的标准，不能一成不变，长期适用。因为标准的制定，应该是跟随工作的进展和广大职工努力创造的成绩而改变。大会将全国机车运用标准的百分率，今年检修机车质量的标准与机车定检间走行公里等都有具体规定。关于今后机务工作的基本任务，他指出：“是经常不断提高机车车辆的质量，及时保证运输需要，避免发生故障，时刻不忘提高机务员工的技术水平，采取先进的机务管理方法，增加效率，厉行节约，为达到逐渐减低运输成本和为今后发展准备力量而奋斗。”
    下午吕副部长总结大会的发言，对这次大会某些旧思想及错误观点进行了批判。他指出实行负责制的障碍主要的是保守主义思想及官僚主义作风。对那些崇拜美国帝国主义有奴才思想的人们，应当改造他们的思想，发展进步分子的作用，教育怀疑分子改造落后分子，以便为恢复与建设全国铁路而奋斗。
    滕部长在讲话中号召大会代表把这次毛主席、朱总司令及中央负责同志的指示及大会的新精神带到现场去担当起新的任务来，把现有的两万八千公里铁道发展到十倍。他又指出周副主席代表军委指出了人民铁路的修复的巨大成绩，这是鼓舞大家今后努力工作的。
　　六位英雄模范荣膺奖章
    接着举行授奖仪式，在军乐声中，二位部长亲自颁发奖章，计有平津局“毛泽东号”司机长李永，东北齐齐哈尔局“铁牛号”司机杜先阳，齐齐哈尔局“八八四号”司机张忠业，吉林铁路管理局梅河口机务段工厂的主任陈志久，平津局“五一劳动号”司机苏寅生等五位英雄荣膺劳动英雄奖章各一枚。宁年典型给水所杨培林荣膺模范工作者奖章一枚。
    授奖仪式毕，滕部长在热烈的欢呼与鼓掌声中，继续讲话，他介绍“毛泽东号”到了丰台机务段后，在他的影响与模范带头下，才培养出新的英雄机车“五一劳动号”。滕部长并号召各路局全体代表努力工作，向新的劳模英雄看齐，产生成千成万的更多的劳模英雄，共同协力把人民铁路办得更好。
　　李永提升段长级司机
  　陈志久授工程师职位
    同时，滕部长宣称：他代表铁道部正式任命“毛泽东号”司机长李永同志提升为段长级司机，并授予陈志久同志以工程师职位。他指出陈志久同志善于计划与组织，他的才能已不下于普通工程师的水平了，他个人丰富的实际经验，甚至还超过普通工程师。例如陈志久同志改造了东北盘石车站给水所的锅炉、烟筒、风挡等不合标准的位置，这种改造就连伪满时代的日本工程师曾经专门研究过也没能解决。滕部长说：这些工人在帝国主义、国民党的统治下是没有人会注意他们的，只有受被剥削被压迫的痛苦，而在今天，在共产党的领导下，他们被发现了，典型英雄也出现了。以陈志久为典型，树立工人新型工程师的旗帜，并号召全体代表要向李永、陈志久等英雄学习看齐。继又宣布提升旧工程师陈达铣（原任平津路局检修股股长）为机务处副处长。滕部长指出陈达铣虽然是个旧工程师，但他参加此次大会是接受新的思想较快，自己还表示愿意克服那些旧思想旧作风，愿意向工人学习以求改造。这种表现正是今后旧工程师改造自己的一条道路和方向，各路局旧有的职员们应向他看齐，大会在热烈的掌声和口号声中宣告胜利闭幕，并有华北电影制片厂拍摄电影。
