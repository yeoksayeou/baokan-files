New Heroes and Heroines
Episode 19: The Great Counteroffensive (Continued—)

   Da Shui was silent for a long time, calculating for a while, and said to Wei Dameng: "Since you have arrived there and are determined to go over, that’s good; if you can’t get through, think of another way." Then he said to Gao Tuncun: "Don't worry, we still have fifteen boats. Divide eight boats to go around, and pick them up when necessary." Gao Tuncun patted his head and laughed, saying, "That's right, we still have a dozen boats!" Wei Dameng's frowning brows relaxed, and he jumped up and said, "Okay, company commander and instructor, I'll lead the boat!" Gao Tuncun said happily, "If you want to go, let's go together."

   Da Shui and Gao Tuncun discussed it and sent Hu Erniu's platoon to the dike slope below the stone bridge to block the stone bridge; if the village started fighting, they would fire a volley at the blockhouse. The two of them and Wei Dameng immediately took eight small boats and went around behind Baima Village.

Five

  As dawn broke, Da Shui and the others sneaked ashore into the village and found the platoon. They were all hiding in the civilian houses, facing the blockhouse, and dug many gun holes in the walls. When the militiamen saw Da Shui and the others coming, they happily said, "Company commander and instructor, you are here! We are all ready, when are we going to fight?"

  Gao Tuncun said: "Don't rush! The instructor and I will shout first to try to get them to surrender." He and Niu Da Shui and Wei Dameng went around to the civilian house right next to the blockhouse. The back wall was right next to the outer ditch of the blockhouse, and there was a small window in the wall. Wei Dameng was very energetic at this time, saying, "I'll fire the first shot!" He jumped onto the cabinet, leaned close to the small window, and shouted at the top of his voice: "Hey—fellow puppet soldiers!..." Who knew that a shot from the blockhouse sent Wei Dameng tumbling down from the cabinet with a thud.

  Da Shui and Gao Tuncun hurriedly shouted: "Da Meng! Da Meng!" The blockhouse fired several more shots at the window. The militiamen in the civilian house cursed and started firing. The militiamen on the stone bridge also opened fire. Wei Dameng climbed up, touched his head and asked, "Did I get hit?"

  It was broad daylight. Da Shui touched him and said, "A flying brick hit you with a bump." Wei Dameng laughed and said, "Damn it, it doesn't matter, I have to shout!" The gunfire stopped. Gao Tuncun rushed to say, "Look at mine." He jumped onto the cabinet, flashed to the side of the small window, and shouted at the top of his voice: "What's the matter? You can shoot! The Eighth Route Army is not afraid of your shooting, you shoot!"

  A voice from the blockhouse answered: "Comrades, I was asleep just now, and the squad leader told the brothers to shoot, I didn't know, please forgive me!" Da Shui felt a warmth in the voice, but couldn't remember who it was for a moment. It turned out that it was Guo San Mazi who was answering. He had recently been transferred to the city's brigade headquarters, and yesterday he personally came here to convey He Shixiong's orders. He was afraid to go back after dark and was surrounded by the militia inside.

  San Mazi had fought with the Eighth Route Army so many times over the years, suffered a lot of losses, and was a little flustered when he was surrounded again; but he was very cunning and asked politely on the surface: "Comrades, which unit are you from?" Gao Tuncun shouted: "We are the First Company of the 24th Regiment."

  The voice from above said: "Comrades, if you have anything to say, please say it!" Gao Tuncun brought out the prepared set of words: "Japan has surrendered, do you know? You were puppet soldiers before, working for the Japanese. It’s not necessarily your intention to be a traitor; some of you were doing it for a living, and some were forced by the environment, and went down the wrong path! Now that Japan has surrendered, who can you rely on? We are all Chinese, surrender quickly!"

  Guo San Mazi shouted behind the battlement: "We already know that Japan has surrendered. We are ready to surrender, but Captain He has an order that the guns are not to be handed over to you, but to Chiang Kai-shek. Soldiers must obey orders first, and we have no choice in this matter!" The militiamen in the flat shouted angrily when they heard this: "Damn it, hand it over to Chiang Kai-shek! Beat his little bastard!"

  Gao Tuncun hurriedly said: "Don't fight, don't fight!" Then he shouted to the blockhouse: "Why are you handing it over to Chiang Kai-shek? Haven't you seen it in the eight years of the War of Resistance? Who is shedding blood and sacrificing here, fighting Japan? 'Chiang Kai-shek' fled to Mount Emei in Sichuan, only knowing how to issue orders; opposing communism, fighting the Eighth Route Army, and secretly colluding with Japan... Can you hand over your guns to such reactionaries?"

  The blockhouse did not answer. Gao Tuncun shouted: "What's going on?" Guo San Mazi said: "Comrades, come out and talk!" Da Shui and the others discussed that if they didn't go out, people would look down on them; but if they went out, they would be right in front of the building, and if they had bad intentions, they would be beaten. They heard the voice from above shouting again: "Come out, I promise not to shoot!" Niu Da Shui said: "What if you shoot?" Guo San Mazi said: "A grandson of a turtle would shoot!" Gao Tuncun shouted: "If you shoot, we will only shoot you in the future!" Saying that, he ran out the door and stood opposite the blockhouse, Da Shui and Wei Dameng also hurried to follow.

  Da Shui and Gao Tuncun looked outside and saw a pockmarked face sticking out from the battlement of the blockhouse, looking down. They recognized it as Guo San Mazi. Eight years ago, when he wanted tide-flavored rice cakes, he had met them. At that time, they were simple-minded peasants, but now they have changed greatly. San Mazi couldn't recognize them at all, and looked at the gray cloth uniforms they were wearing and asked: "Comrades, what positions do you hold?"

  Gao Tuncun said: "This is our instructor, I am the company commander." Guo San Mazi asked: "Company commander, what is your surname?" Gao Tuncun said: "My surname is Gao." Guo San Mazi said: "Company Commander Gao, you have come, I have nothing else to offer, here are some cigarettes for you to smoke." Saying that, he threw down a pack of Hardman cigarettes, throwing it at the foot of the building.

  Da Shui thought that if he went to pick up the cigarettes, a hand grenade would be thrown down, and it would be bad; besides, it would not be good to pick up the cigarettes. Just as he was thinking, who knew that Wei Dameng, with his vigorous strength, darted to the edge of the ditch and picked up the cigarettes. Niu Da Shui hurriedly stopped him and said to Guo San Mazi: "Thank you for your kindness, our Eighth Route Army doesn't smoke your kind of cigarettes!" Wei Dameng immediately threw the cigarettes back to the blockhouse with force.

  Instructor Niu Da Shui then talked to them about the last days of the puppet army and the Communist Party's lenient policy. When he was talking, the puppet soldiers were all lying on the battlement listening. Finally, Gao Tuncun couldn't help but ask: "What's going on? Are you coming down or not?" Guo San Mazi said in an official tone: "Okay, let me think about it, I'll give you an answer tonight." Niu Da Shui said: "If you want to come down, come down happily, don't delay!"

  At this moment, Hei Lao Cai sent the women's association's beautiful daughter Li Xiaozhu, with some family members of the puppet soldiers, to cooperate in shouting, and Hu Erniu sent someone to send them to Da Shui. An old woman surnamed Ma was the mother of the puppet army squad leader on this blockhouse. She saw her son on the top of the building and started crying, pointing and shouting: "Er Heizi! Why don't you come down? What time is it! The Eighth Route Army has surrounded you, and they are earnestly persuading you, but you are still waiting to die up there? Er Heizi, come down and go home with your mother!"

  A daughter-in-law shouted to her husband: "Dad of Xiaoshun, you are really confused! I have worn the hat of a traitor with you for so many years, why don't you take it off for me now? The devils are finished, who are you being a traitor for? Every time the gunfire rings, the family is worried, always afraid that you will lose your life; the Eighth Route Army is lenient with you, why don't you go home? Do you want to be a traitor for the rest of your life? If you don't come down today, I will die in front of you!"

  For a while, the women were calling and shouting, and they were all crying. Many of the puppet soldiers on the building were shedding tears. Xiu Nü'er shouted with her chest puffed out: "Fellow puppet soldiers, we are all Chinese, and our Eighth Route Army doesn't want you to die in vain; now there are two roads: one is the road to survival, put down your weapons immediately and reunite with your parents and wives; or take the road to death, and leave a bad name for your descendants. Think about it carefully!"

  Li Xiaozhu also helped to shout... The puppet soldiers above were all drooping their heads, sighing; some were covering their faces and crying. Squad leader Er Heizi and several puppet soldiers asked San Mazi: "Captain, tell us, what are we going to do?" Although San Mazi was bad, he was a coward. Seeing that the situation was not good, he hurriedly perfunctorily said to them: "Don't worry! I am also a Chinese, isn't it easy to talk about?" Then he shouted to the bottom of the building: "Don't say anything, let us discuss it for a while." Da Shui and the others shouted: "Hurry up! Don't delay!" The puppet soldiers were discussing in groups of three or five, whispering. The bottom was also urging them. Guo San Mazi saw that the people above and below were of one mind, fearing that he would be isolated and suffer a loss; so he said to the bottom of the building: "Comrades, wait a moment! Our people will go to pack things up immediately."

  Suddenly, gunfire rang out from Huangzhuang, and the fighting was fierce. It was the troops from the city coming to pick up Guo San Mazi, and they were fighting with Liu Xier's platoon. Guo San Mazi's face changed, and he hurriedly said to his soldiers: "Don't pack up yet!" Then he climbed on the battlement and shouted: "Comrades, I'm sorry! The brigade from the city is out, we can't leave, you all retreat quickly!"

  The militiamen and women below all roared, shouting: "Why can't we leave?" "Come down immediately!" "What are you waiting for if you don't come down?" Guo San Mazi shrank his head back and shouted: "No, no! I can't bear this responsibility!" Before he finished speaking, squad leader Er Heizi and several puppet soldiers snatched his gun from behind. Many puppet soldiers shouted: "We surrender! We surrender!" They all ran down, holding their guns upside down.

  The enemy on Huangzhuang was ambushed by Liu Xier and was driven back to the city. Here, Guo San Mazi also surrendered obediently.

  On this day, more than a thousand militiamen cleared all the outer strongholds of the county seat. At dusk, the First Company received an order from the county to enter Da Shizhuang, preparing to attack the city at night.

  Niu Da Shui and Gao Tuncun led the militia's First Company to Da Shizhuang. The people of Da Shizhuang rewarded the First Company with generous food and meat.

  After dinner, Instructor Niu and Company Commander Gao studied it and sent someone to call the puppet "liaison officer" of this village to ask about the enemy's situation. The liaison officer was a poor old man. As soon as he came in, he stood against the door. Da Shui asked him to sit down, but he didn't dare to sit and said: "Comrades, if you have anything to tell me, please teach me a lesson! I am a traitor!"

  Gao Tuncun smiled and comforted him: "Don't say that, old man, as long as you don't forget that you are Chinese, we welcome you!" The old man sat on the edge of the chair, smiled comfortably, and said: "Seeing you comrades of the Eighth Route Army, cherishing the old and pitying the poor, talking and laughing with us, it's great; meeting you, my old life has been transferred!"

  Da Shui asked with a smile: "Have you heard of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army before?" The old man said: "Hey, the high mountains can't block the sun! We have such a saying here: 'The water in the Dian is clear, the water in the river is muddy, the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, who is loyal and who is treacherous is most clear!' Who doesn't have a number in their heart!"

  After talking for a while, Da Shui asked him to talk about the situation in the city. The old man said interestingly: "You ask this, I know, I went there yesterday. Speaking of Japan, the 'hero' is also Japan, and the chicken is also Japan." Gao Tuncun asked: "What's going on?" The old man smiled and said: "Now the Japanese are all sweeping the streets, and the traitors have become masters, managing the Japanese. The Japanese team's Type 38 rifles were handed over to the traitor team, and the traitor team's broken guns were handed over to the Japanese, and they are all preparing to run to Baoding every day."

  Da Shui asked: "How did you see that they wanted to run?" He said: "Hey, I know! Outside the North Gate, under the North Guan Tower, four large troughs are prepared in the river, and the people who use the boats are not allowed to leave day and night, isn't this preparing to escape? There is also one thing, the traitor team is selling things in the city, the grain and clothes they robbed... even their quilts, broken jackets, they are selling everything, isn't it the way they want to leave?"

  Da Shui and Gao Tuncun also asked about the situation on the North Guan blockhouse. The old man said that a squad was guarding the building, without machine guns, and one post was stationed at night.

  Finally, Da Shui asked: "A while ago, the plainclothes team arrested a female Eighth Route Army in Dongguan and locked her up in the city. Have you heard any news?" The old man said: "Wasn't she carrying a fat boy?" Da Shui's heart beat faster, and he hurriedly said: "Yes, yes, yes! How is she?" The old man said: "Ah! This... a few days ago, I heard she was being interrogated, but I can't say for sure these days!"

  Da Shui was very disturbed. He tried to restrain himself and not think about this matter. After sending the old man back, he hurriedly went out with Gao Tuncun to gather the team, preparing to carry out the glorious task given to them by the Party, to attack the city. (To be continued)

　　新儿女英雄传
  　第十九回  大反攻（续—）
    大水老半天没言语，盘算了一阵，对魏大猛说：“你既是到了那儿，有决心过去，这就好；过不去，另想办法。”又对高屯儿说：“别着急，咱们还有十五只船呢。分八只船绕过去，必要的时候就把他们接出来。”高屯儿拍着脑袋笑起来说：“可不，咱们还有十几只船哩么！”魏大猛狞着的眉头开了，跳起来说：“好，连长指导员，我领着船去吧！”高屯儿乐呵呵的说：“要去咱们一块儿去。”
    大水高屯儿商量了一下，就派胡二牛这个排运动到石桥这边的堤坡下面，堵住石桥；如果村里打响了，就朝岗楼上打排子枪。他俩和魏大猛几个，马上坐着八只小船，绕到白马村后面去。
    五
    天麻麻亮，大水他们偷偷的上岸进村，找到那一排人。他们都藏在民房里，对着岗楼，在墙上挖了许多枪眼儿。民兵们见大水他们来了，都高兴的说：“连长指导员，你们都来啦！咱们都准备好了，什么时候打？”
    高屯儿说：“别忙！我和指导员先去喊话，争取他们投降。”他和牛大水魏大猛绕到岗楼紧根前的民房里。那后墙就在岗楼的外沟边，墙上有个小窗户。魏大猛这会儿可起劲呢，说：“我打头一炮！”他跳到躺柜上，凑在小窗户根前，拉开大嗓门就喊：“喂——伪军同胞们！……”谁知道岗楼上叭的一枪，魏大猛就从柜上咕咚一声摔下来了。
    大水高屯儿忙喊：“大猛！大猛！”岗楼上又朝窗子打了几枪。民房里的民兵们骂着，都乒乒乓乓的打起来了。石桥那边的民兵们，也打开了排子枪。魏大猛爬起来，摸着脑袋问：“准是打着我了吧？”
    天大亮了。大水给他碰了一下，说：“是打飞的砖块儿碰了你一个青疙瘩。”魏大猛笑着说：“他妈的不碍，我还得喊！”枪声停了。高屯儿抢着说：“瞧我的。”他跳上躺柜，闪在小窗户一边，扯着脖子大声喊：“怎么着？你们打枪吧！八路军不怕你们打，你们打吧！”
    岗楼上答话了：“同志们，刚才我睡着了，班长叫弟兄们打枪我不知道，你们原谅些吧！”大水一听这声音有点儿热，一时又想不起是谁。原来答话的正是郭三麻子。最近他调在城里大队部，昨天他亲自到这儿来传达何世雄的命令，天黑了不敢回去，刚好给民兵包围在里面了。
    三麻子这些年来，跟八路军斗过多少回，吃了不少亏，这回又给包围住了，心里早有些着慌；可是他很狡猾，表面上很客气的问：“同志们，你们是那一部分？”高屯儿喊：“我们是二十四团一连。”
    楼上说：“有什么话，同志们讲吧！”高屯儿就把准备好的一套端出来了：“日本投降了，你们知道吧？早先你们当伪军，给日本人卖命，不准是本心愿意当汉奸，有的是为了生活，有的是给环境逼的，走到岔道儿上啦！现在日本都投降了，你们还有个什么靠头啊？咱们都是中国人，赶快下来缴枪吧！”
    郭三麻子在垛口后面喊：“日本投降，我们已经知道啦。我们就准备缴枪，可是何大队长有命令，枪不交给你们，交给蒋介石去。军人首先得服从，这事儿我们也没有办法！”平房里的民兵们听了，都气愤愤的喊：“他妈的，交给蒋介石！打他兔崽子！”
    高屯儿忙说：“别打别打！”又对岗楼上喊：“你们为什么交给蒋介石？抗战八年，你们还没瞧见呀？谁在这儿流血牺牲，打日本来？‘蒋该杀’逃到四川峨嵋山，光知道发号施令；反共，打八路军，背地里还跟日本拉拉扯扯…这样的反动分子，你们还能把枪交给他？”
    岗楼上不答话。高屯儿喊：“怎么着啊？”郭三麻子说：“同志们出来谈吧！”大水他们商量，不出去怕人瞧不起；要出去吧，出门就在楼跟前，他们要不怀好意，可刚好挨打啦。听见楼上又喊：“你们出来吧，我保证不打枪！”牛大水说：“你打枪怎么着？”郭三麻子说：“孙子王八蛋才打枪！”高屯儿喊：“你要打枪，往后我们专打你！”说着跑出门，站在岗楼对面，大水魏大猛也忙跟着去了。
    六
    大水高屯儿到外面一看，岗楼的垛口上伸出个麻脸儿，在朝下面望呢，认得是郭三麻子。看他手里没拿枪，大水他俩也把提着的盒子枪放进枪套里。那郭三麻子，在八年前要潮脂糕的时候，和他俩对过面。那会儿，他俩个是土头土脑的庄稼人，现在可大大的变了。三麻子哪里认得出，瞅着他俩身上穿的灰布军装问：“同志，你们都担负什么职务？”
    高屯儿说：“这是我们的指导员，我是连长。”郭三麻子问：“连长贵姓？”高屯儿说：“我姓高。”郭三麻子说：“高连长，你们来了，没有别的奉送，送给你们一些烟抽吧。”说着，扔下一条哈德门，扔在楼根底下了。
    大水想，要去拿烟，一颗手溜弹扔下来，就坏了；再说，去拿了烟影响也不好。正想着，谁知道魏大猛一股子猛劲儿，一窜就到了沟沿上，把烟拾起来。牛大水忙喝住他，对郭三麻子说：“谢谢你的好意，我们八路军不抽你们那号烟！”魏大猛听了，马上把纸烟用力一抛，扔回岗楼去了。
    指导员牛大水就跟他们讲伪军的末路，和共产党的宽大政策。讲的时候，伪军们一个个全爬在垛口上听呢。临了，高屯儿耐不住问：“怎么着？你们到底下来不下来？”郭三麻了打着官腔说：“好，让我想想，晚上再给你们答复吧。”牛大水说：“你们要下来就痛痛快快下来，别拖延时间！”
    正在这时候，黑老蔡派妇会的秀女儿李小珠，带了一些伪军家属，来配合喊话，胡二牛打发人把她们送到大水这儿来了。一个马老婆是这岗楼上伪军班长的娘，她一眼望见楼顶上的儿子，就啼哭开了，指着喊：“二黑子啊！你还不下来？这是什么时候啦！八路军把你们围上了，人家苦口婆心的叫你们，你还在上面等死呀？二黑子，快下来跟娘家走吧！”
    一个媳妇喊她丈夫：“小顺她爹，你真糊涂！我跟着你戴了这么些年的汉奸帽子，这会儿还不给我摘？鬼子都完蛋了，你还给谁当汉奸呀？枪声一响，一家人提心吊胆的，老怕你送了这条命；八路军宽大你，你还不回家？你想当一辈子汉奸啊？今天你不下来，我就死在你眼前！”
    一时妇女们叫的叫，喊的喊，全都哭开了。楼上的伪军好些个掉眼泪。秀女儿挺着胸脯喊：“伪军同胞们，都是中国人，咱们八路军也不愿意你们白白送死；眼下就是两条路：一条活路，马上放下武器，跟你们爹娘媳妇儿一家子团圆；要不就走死路，死了还给子子孙孙留个臭名儿。你们好好儿想想吧！”
    李小珠也帮着喊……伪军们在上面一个个搭拉着脑袋，唉声叹气；有的蒙着脸儿哭。班长二黑子和几个伪军问三麻子：“队长，你说吧，咱们怎么着？”三麻子虽然坏，可是个松包，一看这形势不妙，忙敷衍他们说：“你们别着急！我也是个中国人，还不好说？”又对楼下面喊：“你们别说了，一会儿我们商量商量吧。”大水他们喊：“你们快些吧？别耽搁啦！”伪军们三三五五，嘁嘁啐啐的商议。下面又一个劲儿的催。郭三麻子看楼上楼下成了一个心儿，生怕自个儿孤立起来，吃眼前亏；就对楼下说：“同志们，你们等一等！我们的人马上就去拾掇东西。”
    忽然黄庄那边枪声响了，打得很激烈，是城里来接郭三麻子的部队，和柳喜儿一排人打上了。郭三麻子变了脸，忙对他手下的战士说：“你们先别拾掇！”又爬在垛口上喊：“同志们，对不起你们！城里大队出来了，我们走不成，你们快撤吧！”
    下面的民兵和妇女们一齐哄起来了，乱喊着：“怎么走不成？”“马上下来！”“不下来还等什么？”郭三麻子缩进头去，叫着：“不行不行！我可负不起这个责任！”话还没说完了班长二黑子和几个伪军从后面把他的枪夺了。许多伪军喊着：“我们缴枪！我们缴枪！”都倒提着枪，跑下来了。
    黄庄那边的敌人中了柳喜儿的伏击，给打回城里去了。这儿，郭三麻子也乖乖儿的投了降。　
    这一天，一千多民兵把县城的外围据点全扫清了。傍黑，第一连接到县上的命令，进到大石庄，准备夜间去攻城。
    七
    牛大水高屯儿带着民兵第一连，来到大石庄。大石庄的老百姓，用大鱼大肉慰劳第一连。
    吃罢晚饭，牛指导员和高连长研究了一下，就派人把这村的伪“联络员”叫来，问敌人的情况。联络员是个穷老头子，一进来就挨门立着。大水叫他坐下，他想坐不敢坐的说：“同志们有什么事儿，教训教训我吧！我是个汉奸哟！”
    高屯儿笑着安慰他：“别那么说，老人家只要你不忘记是个中国人，我们就欢迎你！”老头儿坐在椅子边上，松心的笑了，说：“看你们八路同志，惜老怜贫的，对咱们有说有笑，嘻嘻啦啦；碰上你们，我可是老命转运啦！”
    大水笑着问！“你以前也听说过共产党八路军吧？”老头儿说：“嗨，山高遮不住太阳啊！我们这儿有这么个话：‘淀水清，河水浑，共产党和国民党，谁忠谁奸最分明！’谁心里还没个数儿呀！”
    说了一阵闲话，大水就叫他说说城里的情况。老头儿怪有意思的说：“你问这个我可知道，昨天我还去过呢。提起日本来，‘英雄’也是日本，草鸡也是日本。”高屯儿问：“那是怎么回事？”老头儿笑着说：“现在日本人全扫街呢，汉奸可成了大老爷啦，管着日本子呢。日本队的三八大枪交给了汉奸队，汉奸队的破枪交给了日本子，天天都在准备往保定跑呢。”
    大水问：“你从哪儿看出来他们想跑呢？”他说：“嗨，我可知道！北门外，北关楼子下面，河里准备了四只大槽子，使船的人黑间白日都不叫走开，这还不是预备逃跑啊？还有一桩，汉奸队在城里紧直卖东西，抢来的粮食、衣裳……连他们的被子，破袄儿，什么都卖，还不是想走的样儿呀？”
    大水高屯儿又问北关岗楼上的情形。老头儿说，守楼的是一个小队，没有机枪，夜间站一个岗。
    末了，大水问：“前一个时候，便衣队在东关抓了个女八路，关在城里，你听说有什么信儿没有？”老头儿说：“不是还带着个胖小子吗？”大水心跳着，忙说：“对对对！她怎么样了？”老头儿说：“啊呀！这……前几天还听说过堂呢，这两天可说不清了！”
    大水心里很乱，他努力克制自己，不去想这个事儿。打发老头儿回去以后，忙跟高屯儿出去集合队伍，准备执行党给他们的光荣任务，去攻成。（未完）
