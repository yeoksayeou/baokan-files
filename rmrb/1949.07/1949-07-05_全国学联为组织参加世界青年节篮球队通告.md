All-China Students' Federation Notice Regarding Organizing a Basketball Team to Participate in the World Youth Festival

    The All-China Students' Federation has decided to organize a men's basketball team to participate in the World Youth Festival to be held in Budapest, Hungary in August. Due to the late notice and extremely tight schedule, it is impossible to select players from across the country. We have decided to select only from students in Beijing and Tianjin. Notice is hereby given that any students from schools in Beijing and Tianjin who wish to participate in the preliminary selection should bring a letter of certification from their school's student union to the All-China Students' Federation (17 East Chang'an Avenue, Beijing) or the Tianjin Student Federation to register on the 5th and 6th (8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM each day). We will invite sports figures from Beijing and Tianjin to form a selection committee to conduct the selection on a regular basis. Student unions of all schools are requested to post this notice within their schools and handle the certification procedures within the specified dates. No further notification will be given.
    All-China Students' Federation, July 4th

　　全国学联为组织参加世界青年节篮球队通告
    全国学联决定组织一个男子篮球队，参加八月间在匈京布达佩斯举行的世界青年节。由于接到通知太晚，时间十分匆迫，不能从全国范围内选派，我们决定只从平津两市同学中选定。兹通告凡北平、天津两市各校同学愿意参加预选的，请持该校学生会证明函件于五、六两日（每日上午八时到十二时，下午二时到六时）到全国学联（北平东长安街十七号）或天津市学联报名，由我们聘请平、津体育界人士组织评选委员会定期评选。各校学生会希即将本通告抄贴校内，并于规定日期内负责办理证明手续，不另通知。
