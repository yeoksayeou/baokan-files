　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: Moscow Dispatch: Labor Daily published an article by Aydes on the 21st entitled "The Reactionaries' Offensive Against the Japanese Working Class." The author emphasized that present-day Japan is a battlefield of intense class struggle. The American occupation authorities, the reactionary Yoshida government, and Japanese monopoly capitalists are jointly launching an offensive against the vital interests of the working people and their trade union rights.

　　Post-war Japanese trade unions have become mass organizations, uniting approximately seven million factory workers and office staff. The majority of trade unions are led by progressive leaders and have joined the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　Under American occupation, the living conditions of the Japanese working people have severely deteriorated. In the struggle to improve their lives, the Japanese working people have put forward political demands, including the realization of worker control over factories and the resignation of the reactionary Yoshida government.

　　The class struggle in Japan is becoming increasingly acute. The police are increasingly and frequently inflicting physical violence on workers. The blood of Japanese workers is often spilled on the streets of Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, and other Japanese cities. This police terror is primarily directed at the Japanese Communist Party, which is fighting for the true democratic revival of Japan and the elimination of militarism. The Yoshida government, supported by MacArthur, is hastily preparing to establish a "Non-Japanese Activities Committee" and drafting plans to outlaw the Japanese Communist Party.

　　The American and Japanese reactionaries, fearing the growing workers' movement, have been forced to take measures to isolate the Japanese workers' movement from the world's democratic people. This is the reason why MacArthur unreasonably prevented Japanese trade union representatives from attending the Tenth Soviet Trade Union Congress, and also why representatives of Japanese democratic masses were prohibited from attending the World Peace Congress and Japanese trade union representatives were prevented from attending the Second World Trade Union Congress.

　　However, the reactionaries' attempt to subordinate the Japanese labor movement to the interests of the monopoly capitalists will not succeed. The strength of the Japanese democratic camp is growing stronger day by day.

    【新华社北平二十五日电】莫斯科讯：劳动报于二十一日刊载艾杜斯论“反动派对日本工人阶级的攻势”一文。作者着重指出：目前的日本是剧烈的阶级斗争的战场。美国占领当局、吉田反动政府及日本独占资本家，正在合力对劳动人民的切身利益及其职工会权利发动攻势。
    战后的日本职工会，已成为群众性的组织。它团结了约七百万工厂工人及机关职工。大多数职工会都是由进步的领袖领导，并且加入了世界工联。
    在美国占领下，日本劳动人民的生活状况已严重地恶化。日本劳动人民在进行争取改善生活的斗争时，已提出了政治要求，其中包括实现工人对工厂的管制以及吉田反动政府的辞职等。
    日本的阶级斗争已愈来愈尖锐。警察愈来愈经常地对工人的肉体施以暴行。日本工人的鲜血时常洒在东京、大坂、神户及其他日本城市的街道上。这种警察恐怖，首先是施于正在为日本真正民主复兴及消灭军国主义而斗争的日本共产党。麦克阿瑟支持下的吉田政府，正在匆匆筹备成立“非日活动委员会”，草拟取缔日本共产党的计划。
    美国与日本的反动派，害怕增涨着的工人运动，不得不采取措施使日本工人运动与世界民主人民隔绝。这就是麦克阿瑟无理地不准日本职工会代表出席第十届苏联职工会大会的原因，这也是禁止日本民主大众的代表出席世界和平大会及不准日本职工会代表出席第二届世界职工会代表大会的原因。
    但是，反动派想使日本职工运动服从于独占资本家利益的企图，是不会成功的。日本民主阵营的力量，正一天比一天地更为强大。
