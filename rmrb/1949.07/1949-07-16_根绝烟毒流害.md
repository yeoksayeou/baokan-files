Eradicating the Scourge of Opium and Drugs

The "Interim Measures for the Prohibition of Opium and Drugs in the North China Region" promulgated by the North China People's Government is an important measure to protect the people's health, conserve the people's wealth, and increase labor production. Eradicating the opium and drug scourge of more than a hundred years will be an arduous task, and a major event worthy of attention from all sectors.

Opium and drugs were used by imperialists and the reactionary ruling class of China to harm the Chinese people. The so-called "policy of poisoning" was one of the most vicious conspiracies of Japanese imperialism to enslave the Chinese people. The scourge of opium and drugs in China has a history as long as imperialist aggression against China. For over a hundred years, the governments of the reactionary ruling class—from the Qing Dynasty government, the Northern Warlord government, to the Kuomintang reactionary government—have carried out several so-called "prohibitions of opium and drugs." However, they were not genuinely prohibiting opium and drugs. Today, the People's Government is prohibiting opium and drugs, and it is fundamentally different from any previous prohibition of opium and drugs by the reactionary ruling class governments. Those governments were all anti-people governments. They colluded with imperialists to extract the people's wealth, damage the people's health, and paralyze the people's will to resist through opium and drugs. Opium and drugs were a component of their reactionary ruling policies. Their supposed prohibition of opium and drugs was merely a deceptive trick with other intentions. Now, we have overthrown the Kuomintang reactionary government, eliminated imperialist rule in China, and the People's Government is leading the people in various construction undertakings. Therefore, it is necessary to eradicate the enemies of construction—opium and drugs that damage the people's health, waste the people's wealth, and depress the consciousness of labor. The promulgation of the "Interim Measures for the Prohibition of Opium and Drugs in the North China Region" precisely demonstrates the determination to eradicate opium and drugs and the positive significance of promoting labor production.

The purpose of the so-called "prohibition of opium and drugs" by past reactionary governments was mainly to monopolize the high profits from opium and drugs. Therefore, they used severe penalties and harsh laws to intimidate the people. The more severe the criminal law, the higher the price of opium and drugs, and the thicker the monopolistic profits for the privileged class to manufacture, traffic, distribute, and force the planting of opium. They sometimes executed a few scapegoats as a smokescreen to protect the biggest opium traffickers: imperialists, warlords, bureaucrats, compradors, landlords, and Kuomintang reactionary agents and henchmen, who made a fortune. This was the essence of their prohibition of opium and drugs. The People's Government's measures to prohibit opium and drugs are realistic and earnestly implemented. For those who in the past smoked or injected; privately planted or stored; and even trafficked or manufactured, as long as they quit within the time limit according to the measures for the prohibition of opium and drugs, hand over opium and drugs and equipment to the public, and cease business, they will be treated with leniency. The People's Government treats them with the spirit of treating illness and saving people, and provides education and transformation. In implementation, special emphasis is placed on publicity and explanation, mobilizing the masses, and cooperating to implement. Making the prohibition of opium and drugs a mass movement, so that the opium and drug scourge has no gap to exploit.

In the past, the reactionary governments' prohibition of opium and drugs was always tight at times and loose at times. Tight at times to raise the price of opium and drugs, loose at times to open up opium and drug sales channels. Tight and loose, both had their "wonderful use" in monopolizing opium and drug profits. The People's Government's measures for the prohibition of opium and drugs may seem very lenient, but in implementation, it will inevitably become more and more in-depth and more and more strict, until the opium and drug scourge is completely eradicated. If anyone misunderstands the leniency of the People's Government's measures to prohibit opium and drugs, and intentionally takes advantage of loopholes, daring to test the law, they will surely be abandoned by the broad masses of the people, and will surely be punished by the People's Government. In short, the People's Government's prohibition of opium and drugs is for the people, and relies on the awareness and reporting of the masses of the people, so it will inevitably be successful.

Finally, it should be noted that we must be vigilant against the lingering influence of the various barbaric and cruel methods of "prohibition of opium and drugs" by the past reactionary governments, as well as the situations of pursuing private gain and engaging in malpractice, among cadres and the masses. When we implement the work of prohibiting opium and drugs, we must explain and educate in advance to prevent the occurrence of deviations.

    根绝烟毒流害
    华北人民政府颁布的“华北区禁烟禁毒暂行办法”，乃是保护人民健康，节约人民财富，提高劳动生产的重要措施，而根除百余年来的烟毒祸害，将是一件艰巨的工作，是值得各界予以重视的一件大事。
    烟毒是帝国主义及中国反动统治阶级拿来祸害中国人民的，所谓“毒化政策”，便是日本帝国主义奴役中国人民最恶毒的阴谋之一。烟毒流害中国，和帝国主义侵略中国有同样长久的历史，百余年来，反动统治阶级的政府——从满清政府、北洋军阀政府，直到国民党反动政府曾经过若干次的所谓“禁烟禁毒”，但是，他们并不是真正在禁烟禁毒。今天人民政府来禁烟禁毒，和过去反动统治阶级政府任何的禁烟禁毒，在本质上是绝不相同的。那些政府都是反人民的政府，它们勾结帝国主义靠烟毒来榨取人民财富，损坏人民健康，麻醉人民反抗意志。烟毒是他们反动统治政策的组成部分。他们从来禁烟禁毒不过是另有企图的骗人把戏而已。现在，我们打倒了国民党反动政府，清除帝国主义在中国的统治，人民的政府正要领导人民进行各种建设事业，因之就必须根除建设的敌人——破坏人民健康、浪费人民财富、消沉劳动意识的鸦片烟和毒品。“华北区禁烟禁毒暂行办法”的颁布，正表示着根除烟毒的决心，和推动劳动生产的积极意义。
    过去反动政府所谓“禁烟禁毒”的目的，主要是为了垄断烟毒的高额利润。因此他们要用严刑峻法，来恐吓人民。刑法愈严，烟毒价格愈高，特权阶级制造、贩卖、派售、派种烟毒的独占利润也就愈厚。他们有时枪毙几个枉死鬼作幌子，好来保护最大的烟毒贩子帝国主义者、军阀、官僚、买办、地主、国民党反动派的特务党棍们发横财。这就是他们禁烟禁毒的实质。人民政府的禁烟禁毒办法，则是实事求是的，认真执行的。对于过去之吸食、注射；私种私存；甚至贩卖、制造者，只要按照禁烟禁毒办法，依限戒除，将烟毒及器械交公，停止营业，概以宽大处理。人民政府对于他们是以治病救人的精神，施以教育改造。在执行上特别着重宣传解释，动员群众，协力贯彻。使禁烟禁毒成为一个群众运动，使烟毒流害，无丝毫空隙可乘。
    过去反动政府禁烟禁毒，总是时紧时松的。时紧是为了提高烟毒价格，时松是为了放开烟毒销路，时紧时松，均有他垄断烟毒利润的“妙用”。人民政府禁烟禁毒办法，看来固属非常宽大，可是在执行上他必然是愈来愈深入，愈来愈严格，必至彻底根除烟毒流害而后已。倘或有人误解人民政府这一禁烟禁毒办法的宽大，而有意钻空子，敢于以身试法，则一定要遭到广大人民的弃绝，一定要受到人民政府的惩办的。总之，人民政府禁烟禁毒是为了人民，而且是依靠人民群众的觉悟与检举的，所以它将必然获得成功。
    最后，提起注意的，要警惕过去反动政府“禁烟禁毒”的种种野蛮残忍办法，以及营私舞弊等情事在干部群众中所残存的影响，我们在执行禁烟禁毒工作时，须预先解释，教育防止发生偏向。
