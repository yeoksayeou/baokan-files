　　平市机器冶金两业
  　登记告一段落
    【本报讯】平市机器铁工业与金属品冶制业登记、审查及统计工作已告一段落。机器业（能生产成品者）共二百零五厂，有职工一千六百九十三名，马达二百九十一台，共九百匹马力，车床八百三十七台，各种压力、拔丝、剪断机器八十五台，月需铁三百八十四吨，焦炭六十八吨，月产水车四百四十三台，车床十五台，织布机、印刷机、缝纫机、织袜机、弹花轧花机等五百十五台。金属品冶制业共五十八家，职工六百五十九名，有熔铁炉一百二十八座（能熔铁五十四吨），沙箱一千一百八十七座，模子一千一百二十个。月需铁三百九十二吨，焦炭一百九十二吨。两业目前已全部恢复生产，但欲求发展，尚需在减低成本，提高质量，节省原料及彻底实行劳资两利政策方面努力。
