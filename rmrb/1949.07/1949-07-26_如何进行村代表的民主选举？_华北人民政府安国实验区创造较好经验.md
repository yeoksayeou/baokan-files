　　How to Conduct Democratic Elections for Village Representatives?
    An'guo Experimental District, North China People's Government, Creates Good Experience
    [This newspaper's dispatch] From the beginning of this month, the democratic political construction work in the first district of An'guo County, Hebei Central, has, after propaganda and deliberation in various villages, successively elected village representatives. Under the leadership and promotion of the village representative meetings, flood prevention and wheat requisition work have been carried out, and preliminary results have been achieved. All twenty-six villages and Wu Renqiao Town in the first district have completed the elections. The number of representatives is determined by the citizens of each village based on the village's specific situation. Generally, one representative is elected for every 30 or so citizens in regular villages. For example, in Shatu Village, with 653 citizens, 453 citizens participated in the election and elected 28 representatives (23 men and 5 women). Among those elected, 21 were Communist Party members and 7 were non-party members. In Nanloudi Village, the entire village had 909 citizens, with 698 voters participating and electing 28 representatives (24 men and 4 women). There were 20 Communist Party members and 8 non-party members. Generally, these elections adopted a secret ballot method, and the masses were in high spirits. Before the election in Nan Zhangling Village, the village was first divided into sections based on size (i.e., smaller constituencies). Village cadres went to each section to mobilize the masses in depth, publicizing the importance and benefits of this election work, and the masses responded quickly. During the election, the criteria for representatives were first discussed at the meeting: some said to elect those who faithfully serve the people, some said to elect those who are not selfish, and women proposed to elect those who can relieve women's suffering. Others proposed to elect those who are enthusiastic and responsible for their work, and so on. At the beginning of the election, special personnel were selected to be responsible for opening, collecting, and counting the ballots. All the voters were in high spirits and insisted on staying until the meeting adjourned. Among the representatives elected in each village, most were activists with prestige in their work and were enthusiastic about serving the masses. Village cadres who had done good work in the past and Communist Party members with prestige in the village were mostly elected as representatives, while village cadres who were irresponsible in their work or had a poor work style were mostly defeated. In this election, a batch of new forces emerged in each village. About one-third of those elected were honest farmers who had never been cadres, had a good style of work, and were enthusiastic and responsible for their work. Because the election implemented the spirit of democracy, allowing the masses to be masters of their own affairs and elect whomever they wished, and the Communist Party's village branches followed the instructions of the county party committee, paying timely attention to preventing various deviations, the most prestigious, upright, and selfless people in the masses were selected for leadership positions in each village, guaranteeing the successful completion of the election work. The masses generally expressed satisfaction. While the elections were in progress in various villages, the Cihe and Shahe rivers suddenly rose. The villages along the rivers conducted election work on the one hand and organized the masses for flood prevention on the other. In the villages where the elections were completed, representative meetings were immediately convened to discuss wheat requisition work. They evaluated and investigated wheat yields and determined wheat requisition methods, which were then handed over to the village governments for implementation, ensuring that this wheat requisition work was completed extremely quickly under the leadership of the village representative meetings. Many villages completed the work successfully in just half a day. Seeing the practical results of the representative meetings, the masses' enthusiasm became even higher. However, due to the short time and insufficient in-depth propaganda and deliberation, some villages did not fully implement the spirit of this democratic political construction, and thus some shortcomings and deviations occurred in the election: for example, a few party members were found to be monopolizing the election in individual villages, and some village branch party members were not concerned about the election, fearing that being elected as a representative would affect their own production, and therefore did not actively participate in meetings. Some of the masses also lacked understanding and confidence in this election and adopted a passive attitude. In addition, there were also cases of wives voting for their husbands, or one person writing five ballots on behalf of the entire family among five voters in a family. These deviations amidst the achievements should be overcome in future work.

　　如何进行村代表的民主选举？
    华北人民政府安国实验区创造较好经验
    【本报讯】冀中安国县一区民主建政工作，从本月初起，经过各村的宣传酝酿，已先后选出村代表，并在村代表会的领导和推动下，进行防汛与麦征工作，已获初步成绩，一区共有二十六村及伍仁桥镇，均已选举完毕。代表名额均由各村公民根据平村情况决定，一般村庄按三十人左右选出一个代表，如沙土村共有公民六五三人，参加选举公民四五三人共选出代表二十八人（其中男二十三人、女五人），这些被选出的代表中，共产党员二十一人，无党派者七人。南搂底村全村公民九○九人，参加选民六九八名，选出代表二十八人（其中男二十四人，女四人）。共产党员二十人，无党派者八人。此次选举，一般都采取无记名投票方式，群众情绪很高。南张令村在选举前，先按村子大小划片（即小的选区），村干部分头到各片中去，深入动员群众，宣传这次选举工作的重要意义和好处，群众去的很快。在选举时，先在大会上讨论代表条件：有说要选忠实为人民服务的，有说要选不自私自利的，妇女则提出要选举能为妇女解除痛苦的，还有提出要选举对工作热心负责的等等。开始选举时先选出专人负责开票、收票、唱票。全体选民情绪很高，一直坚持到散会才走。各村在选出来的代表中，一般都是工作中有威信，热心为群众办事的积极分子。过去工作好的村干部，和村里有威信的共产党员，大部被选为代表，过去对工作不负责任，或工作作风不好的村干部，则纷纷落选。在这次选举中，各村都涌现出了一批新的力量，大约有三分之一的当选者，都是没当过干部、作风好、对工作热心负责的老实农民。由于选举贯彻了民主精神，完全由群众自己当家作主，愿选谁选谁；而共产党的村支部，则遵守着县委的指示，及时注意防止各种偏向，使各村在群众中最有威信、正派无私的人选到了领导地位上来，保证了选举工作的胜利完成，群众普遍表示满意。在各村选举正进行时，忽然磁河及沙河水涨，各临河村庄即一面进行选举工作，一面组织群众防汛。在选举完成的村庄，立即召开代表会，讨论麦征工作。评议与调查麦季产量，确定麦征办法，交由村政府执行，使此次麦征工作在村代表会的领导下，完成极为迅速，很多村庄只用半天时间，即全部胜利完成。群众看到代表会的实际效果，情绪更形高涨。但这次选举中，由于时间短促，未能充分深入宣传酝酿，某些村庄没把这次民主建政的精神充分贯彻下去，因而在选举中也发生了些缺点和偏向：如个别村庄发现少数党员包办选举，还有部分村支部党员对选举不关心，害怕选上自己作代表，影响自己生产，因而开会不积极参加，群众有的还对这次选举的认识与信心不足，态度消极。另外也有妻子代丈夫选举的，或一家人五个选民中，一个人写五张票，代替全家选举的。这些成绩之中的偏向，应在今后工作中注意克服。
