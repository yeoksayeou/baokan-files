　　Taiyuan Region
  　Plants 180,000 Mu of Cotton
  　Ample Rain and Thriving Seedlings
    ▲ The Taiyuan region's plan to plant 200,000 mu of cotton is basically complete. As of mid-May, the entire region had sown over 182,380 mu of cotton. Among these, the Second Administrative Office accounted for over 128,700 mu, exceeding the original plan by over 3,000 mu. Recent months have seen ample rain and thriving cotton seedlings. The Second Administrative Office has proposed that attention should be paid to preventing and eliminating various disasters, timely seed dressing and topdressing fertilizer, implementing seedling protection instructions, and ensuring the victorious completion of the cotton production plan.
    ▲ The cultivated land area in Ningwu Chengguan District has expanded. The district originally had over 35,500 mu of cultivated land, which was continuously destroyed by the enemy during the war. Under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government, this year it has been restored to over 33,500 mu. The average fertilizer application has also increased by one dan per mu, and cultivation is more meticulous than in the past. At the beginning of spring plowing, the government and the county promotion agency distributed 110 dan of agricultural loans and 10,000 jin of relief grain to the district, coupled with in-depth publicity and leadership from district and village cadres, resulting in this achievement. Leadership is now being strengthened for summer hoeing, and labor exchange and mutual assistance are being organized on a large scale according to the principle of voluntarism.
