　　【Jizhong Electric】To solve the funding difficulties of Gaoyang cloth weavers, improve their quality, and help them with sales, the Gaoyang Branch of the People's Bank of China specially organized order-based loans in Nanbei Jiutou, southwest of the county seat, in June. A total of 640,000 yuan in RMB was loaned, purchasing 90 bolts of cloth from 17 households. This enabled 17 looms to start production. At the same time, to improve the quality of the cloth, it was stipulated that raw materials must be 20-count yarn from Shijiazhuang, and the cloth should be 104 feet long and 2.5 feet wide. Furthermore, in mid-July, the bank also piloted a value-linked loan, lending 300,000 yuan worth of yarn (converted to yarn based on the yarn price on the day of the loan) to six weaving households, with an interest rate of one percent. The repayment will be based on the yarn price on the due date. Many weaving households are still requesting loans from the bank, and the bank is continuing to issue them. In addition, the bank also loaned 1 million yuan to the Gaoyang Workers' Cooperative, enabling the cooperative to sell 300 bolts of colored cloth in the past month, which also helped the sales of Gaoyang cloth and drove the production of the cloth industry.
