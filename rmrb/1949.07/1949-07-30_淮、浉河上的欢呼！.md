　　Cheers on the Huai and Shi Rivers!
    Xin Jian
    On July 13th, on the Huai and Shi Rivers along the Pinghan Railway Line, countless workers and peasants, countless People's Liberation Army soldiers, in trains, on the riverbanks, amidst cheers and the sound of firecrackers, accompanied trains adorned with welcoming red flags and portraits of Chairman Mao, advancing on the newly repaired Changtaiguan Huai River Bridge! Advancing on the newly repaired Shi River Bridge!
    Just a month ago, the situation on both banks and the waters of the Huai and Shi Rivers along the Pinghan Railway Line was so calm, so infuriating! The two reinforced concrete bridges spanning the Huai and Shi Rivers had been bombed into a minced-meat-like collapse into the river. The original steel beams lay submerged in the water like broken bones, some helplessly leaning against the collapsed concrete piles like twisted ladders. And within a radius of seventy or eighty meters, scorched iron sheets and reinforcing bars could be found everywhere. Besides these, the retreating bandit gangs had also turned the area near the Huai River Bridge into a terrifying zone, burying thirty or forty landmines with their devilish hands in the sand on both banks of the bridge. Tragic, desolate, and terrifying – this was everything about the broken bridges on the Huai and Shi Rivers a month ago!
    On June 10th, after the 3rd Detachment of the Railway Corps of the People's Liberation Army repaired the section of the Pinghan Railway Line from Yancheng to Daliuzhuang and the Sha River Bridge, they rode five trains amidst the resounding cheers, all the way from Yancheng to Changtaiguan Station on the bank of the Huai River. On the 11th, the soldiers cleared the landmines on the bank of the Huai River and secured three manual pile-driving wooden frames. From the 12th, in the pouring rain, the soldiers, some bare-chested, some in shirts, began the work of manual pile driving in the waist-deep river water. For several days, the rattling of the steam hammer, the calls and responses of manual pile driving, resonated in unison. In the evening, generators sent electricity everywhere, and the light of electric lamps illuminated both banks of the Huai River Bridge. The clanging of the blacksmith's furnace and the sound of machinery on the engineering vehicles echoed all night. Supplying the bridge-repairing troops with large quantities of splints, screws, and saws, repairing all damaged tools.
    In such a tense and busy environment, it was difficult to find idlers. Cadres and support staff from the headquarters and political department, except for those with particularly urgent work, all went to the site to participate in loading and unloading materials. All vehicles and horses were completely concentrated on transportation to the site. Those who had their health damaged by the rain, river water, or exhaustion, after half a day or a day of rest, would automatically request to participate in the work again. The soldiers, in order to complete the task, braved the rain and worked with all their might, bareheaded. The cadres also braved the rain and worked together with the soldiers, some rolling up their trousers and driving piles in the river, some climbing up the wet, slippery, and tall wooden frames to call out the numbers. After fourteen days and nights of effort, the Huai River Bridge was finally repaired on the 26th. After the Huai River Bridge was repaired, except for a small number of troops left to clean up the site, the main force immediately rushed to the Shi River to assist the troops there in emergency repairs. All the cadres and soldiers of the entire unit worked day and night to commemorate "July 1st" with a traffic opening ceremony. By the 27th, all the preparatory work had been completed, waiting only for the steel beams to be transported and installed. If the steel beams arrived in time, the opening to traffic on July 1st was clearly not a problem.
    People should know that the repair of the Huai and Shi River Bridges was achieved through bloodshed and struggle. On June 22nd, on the bank of the Huai River, the soldier Zhao Yumin stepped on a landmine buried in the sand by the Chiang bandits, which had not been detected during the work, and his flesh and blood flew, sacrificing himself for the interests of the people. There were also many people whose health was damaged or who were injured in the work while fighting against wind, rain, river water, and the scorching sun. But they finally continued to persevere in this work and recovered their health and healed their injuries in a short period of time.
    On the 13th, the opening ceremony of the Huai and Shi River Bridges was held, and the martyr Comrade Zhao Yumin was mourned. When the sound of firecrackers, military music, and cheers celebrating the opening of traffic rang out, the two newly repaired Huai and Shi River Bridges, twenty-eight kilometers apart, stood proudly on the two riverbeds with youthful and vigorous姿态.

　　淮、浉河上的欢呼！
    辛坚
    七月十三日，在平汉线的淮、浉两河上，无数的工农，无数的人民解放军战士，在火车里，在河岸上，在欢呼和浉炮声中，伴随挂着欢迎红旗和毛主席像的火车，在新修复了的长台关淮河桥上前进！在新修复了的浉河桥上前进！
    还在一个月以前，平汉线的淮、浉河的两岸和水面上，情况是多么冷静，多么令人愤恨啊！淮河浉河上架着的两座洋灰大桥，被炸成肉泥一样的坍倒在河里。原有的钢梁，象残骨断骸似的陷在水中，有的象扭折了的梯子一样的无力地靠在倒塌了的洋灰桩上。而在七八十米的半径以内，到处可以找到焦头烂额似的铁片铁筋，除了这些以外，溃退的匪帮又把淮河桥附近制造成一个恐怖的地区，在桥两岸的沙滩里，魔鬼们用毒手埋藏了三四十个地雷，悲惨，凄凉，恐怖，这就是一个月以前淮河浉河破桥上的一切！
    六月十日，人民解放军铁道兵团三支队在修复平汉线郾城至大刘庄段的线路和沙河大桥以后，在锣鼓喧天的欢送声中，坐着五列的火车，从郾城一直开到淮河边上的长台关站。十一日，战士们清扫了淮河岸上的地雷，并且绑扎好三个人力打桩的木架。从十二日起，在大雨滂沱中，战士们有的光着膀子，有的穿着衬衣，在半人深的河水里面，便开始了人力打桩的工作。一连几日，汽锤上的机器答答声，人力打桩时的喊号声和接号声，响成一片。一到晚上，发电机又把电力送到各处，电灯的光芒，照耀了淮河桥的两岸。铁匠炉的叮当声，工程车上机器声，响彻整宿。供给修桥的部队大量的夹板螺丝钯锯，修理一切损坏了的工具。
    在这样紧张忙碌的环境里，闲人是难找到的。司令部政治部各机关的干部和勤杂人员，除了有特别要紧的工作以外，都到现场参加装卸材料，一切的车马，完全集中到现场运输，被雨水淋坏了或者被河水泡病了以及累病了的病号，经过了半天或一天的休息后，又自动的要求参加工作。战士们为了完成任务，冒着雨，光着脑袋加油工作。干部们也冒着雨，和战士在一起，有的挽起裤腿在河里打桩，有的爬上又湿又滑又高的木架上去喊号，经过了十四天的昼夜努力，淮河大桥终于在二十六日修复了。淮河大桥修复以后，除了留下少数部队打扫现场外，主力又立即赶到浉河，帮助那里的部队抢修，全部队的干部战士为着用通车典礼纪念“七一”，通宵达旦，不停工作，到了二十七日，一切准备工作都做好了，单等钢梁运来就按上去，如果钢梁及时运到的话，七月一日的通车，显然是不成问题的。
    人们应该知道淮浉河桥的修复，是经过了流血和斗争的。六月二十二日，在淮河的岸上，战士赵玉民在工作中踏响了未被发觉的蒋匪埋藏在沙滩里的地雷，血肉横飞，为人民的利益牺牲了自己。而在工作中和风雨、河水以及炎热的太阳作斗争而损坏了健康，或碰伤了的也有不少人。但他们终于继续地坚持了这一工作，并在短期间内恢复了健康和治好了炸伤。
    十三日举行了淮浉河两大桥通车典礼，追悼了死难的赵玉民同志，当庆祝通车典礼的鞭炮声军乐声欢呼声响起的时候，这相距二十八公里的新修复起的淮河浉河两大桥上，又以年青健壮的姿态，屹立在两条河床上。
