　　Beijing Guozijian to be Renovated
  　North China People's Government Orders a Factory to Move Out
    [This newspaper's report] The Beijing Guozijian is currently occupied by personnel from a certain factory, resulting in pollution and damage to the site. The Higher Education Commission believes that the Guozijian is an important cultural relic and should be preserved to maintain the government's purpose of protecting antiquities. Moreover, it is one of the five important cultural heritage buildings approved by the government for renovation with 3.8 million yuan, and the renovation project is about to begin. Therefore, it is specially requested that the North China People's Government order the factory to move out as soon as possible in order to protect the cultural relics. After receiving the report, the North China People's Government has ordered the Enterprise Department to instruct the factory to move out. (Yan)
