Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 29th: TASS Moscow, July 27th: The Soviet Ministry of Public Health Research Council discussed the use of painless childbirth methods. As is well known, the Soviet Union is the only country in history to explore the issue of painless childbirth on a large scale. As early as 1936 to 1940, painless childbirth methods had been used in nearly 2.5 million births in obstetrical hospitals throughout the Soviet Union. With the help of progressive scientific achievements, the Soviet Union has mastered the successful use of various anesthesia methods in childbirth. In view of this, the Soviet Ministry of Public Health specifically recommends that painless childbirth methods be used for all parturients who request it and whose health conditions permit. Painless delivery, like other medical treatments in the Soviet Union, is completely free. Painless childbirth methods will soon be taught to a large number of midwives. The Scientific Advisory Council of the Soviet Ministry of Public Health and the Soviet Medical Academy have been ordered to conduct a comprehensive study of painless delivery.

　　苏科学造福母亲
  　广泛使用无痛生产
    已使用二百五十万次近将传授大量助产士
    【新华社北平二十九日电】据塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯，苏联公共卫生部研究会讨论无痛生产方法的使用问题。众所周知，苏联是历史上第一次大规模探究无痛生产问题的唯一国家，早在一九三六年至一九四○年，无痛生产方法已在苏联各处产科医院几近二百五十万次生产中使用。苏联借进步科学成就之助，已掌握在接生中顺利使用各种麻醉方法。苏联公共卫生部有鉴于此，特建议凡产妇有要求，而健康情况又许可的话，一概使用无痛生产方法。无痛接生和苏联其他医疗一样，是完全免费的。无痛生产方法将于最近将来传授大量助产士。苏联公共卫生部科学咨议会和苏联医学院，已奉命对无痛接生问题再进行全面研究。
