Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th - Reports from various sources: The Australian national coal mine strike, which began on June 27, has now entered its fourth week. The Australian government continues to carry out frenzied suppression, but it has met with heroic resistance from the miners and all Australian workers. In recent days, several more trade union leaders have been arrested, detained for allegedly refusing to explain the use of funds withdrawn before the government enacted the law freezing union funds. Those arrested include Federal Miners' Union Acting President Parkinson. On July 16, striking miners held a grand demonstration and mass rally in Newcastle to protest the detention of trade union leaders and the government's suppression measures. The Victorian state government announced the existence of a limited state of emergency on the 15th, attempting to conscript strikebreakers to unload 6,700 tons of coal from a Canadian ship boycotted by the Seamen's Union. However, the Victorian Railway Union executive has announced that it will not transport this batch of coal. The Australian government also plans to deploy troops to forcibly transport coal from mines in New South Wales, but the Miners' Union, Railway Union, and other unions have announced they will resist. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, a tool of the Australian government, proposed to the strikers that they resume work before the authorities consider the strikers' demands, but this was resolutely rejected by the Combined Mining Unions Committee and the Miners' Union. The latter proposed convening a meeting with all parties to discuss and resolve the strike issue, replacing the existing government arbitration bodies, and reiterated that miners could only be asked to return to work after the unconditional release of all detained trade union leaders, the withdrawal of court charges against all trade union leaders, and the abolition of anti-strike laws.

　　澳煤矿工人英勇反击疯狂镇压
  　大罢工进入第四周
    【新华社北平二十日电】各方报道：六月二十七日开始的澳大利亚全国煤矿大罢工，现已进入第四周。澳政府继续进行疯狂镇压，但遭到矿工与全澳工人的英勇反击。连日又有工会领袖多名被捕，他们因被控拒绝说明在政府颁布冻结工会基金法以前提取存款的用途而遭拘禁。被捕者中包括联邦矿工工会代理主席巴金逊。七月十六日，罢工的矿工们在纽卡斯尔举行盛大的示威游行与群众大会，抗议拘禁职工会领袖与政府的镇压措施。维多利亚州政府于十五日宣布有限度的紧急状态的存在，企图征用罢工破坏者为海员工会抵制的加拿大船卸下六千七百吨煤斤，但是，该州铁路工会执行人已宣布，决不装运这批煤斤。澳政府又计划出动军队强运新南威尔士矿场上的煤斤，但是，矿工工会、铁路工会与其他工会已宣布予以抵制。澳政府曾经意御用的澳大利亚职工会委员会向罢工者提出在当局考虑罢工者的要求以前先行复工的建议，但遭到混合矿业工会委员会与矿工工会的断然拒绝，后者提出召集有各方面参加的会议，以代替现有的政府仲裁机关，讨论解决罢工问题，并重申只有在无条件释放所有被拘禁的工会领袖、撤回法庭对一切工会领袖的起诉、废除反罢工法以后，才能要求矿工复工。
