　　The Communist Youth League Central Committee and the All-China Students' Federation

　　Invite Tianjin and Beijing Sports Figures to Discuss Youth Sports Movement
    Basketball Team to Be Selected to Participate in World Youth Festival

    [Our Dispatch] The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Students' Federation jointly invited more than 20 sports figures from Tianjin and Beijing, including Ma John and Xu Yingchao, on July 3rd to discuss youth sports movements in Tianjin and Beijing and the selection and organization of a basketball team to participate in the World Youth Festival. Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, personally attended and spoke, explaining that China's sports have always been backward. Under the reactionary and corrupt rule of the Kuomintang, sports activities were subjected to various controls and obstacles, becoming activities and performances for a few people, unable to develop into mass sports movements. In the future, in a New Democratic society, in order to ensure that the younger generation has a healthy physique and to establish a strong and solid national defense, the People's Democratic Government will establish mass sports movements from schools to factories, from cities to villages, from students to workers, peasants, and all social strata. The sports figures present listened and criticized the past Kuomintang reactionary government for regarding sports activities as mere decorations, copying foreign practices. They said that in the future, they should strive to create their own practices based on China's actual conditions.

    Finally, the meeting elected Ma John, Xu Yingchao, Mou Zuoyun, Du Qiwu, Guan Yushan, Li De'an, Li Fenglou, Qi Youyi, Ke Zaishuo and other nine people to form the All-China Students' Federation basketball team selection committee for the World Youth Festival. Registration will be on the 5th and 6th, and selection will be on the 7th and 8th. The team organization work will be completed on the 9th, and a public performance will be held before going abroad.

　　青年团中央与全国学联
  　邀平津体育界人士座谈青年体育运动
    将选篮球队参加世界青年节
    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会与中华全国学生联合会，于七月三日联合邀请平津体育界人士马约翰、徐英超等二十余人，座谈平津青年体育运动和选拔组织参加世界青年节的篮球队事宜。青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬同志亲临讲话，他说明中国的体育一向落后，在国民党反动腐败的统治下，体育运动遭受到种种控制与阻挠，成为少数人的活动和表演，不能开展成为群众性的体育运动。今后在新民主主义社会里，要使青年一代有健全的体格，建立强大巩固的国防，人民民主政府将由学校到工厂，由都市到乡村，由学生到工人、农民和社会各阶层，建立人民大众的体育运动。到会体育界人士听了，纷纷指斥过去国民党反动政府是把体育活动看作点缀品，抄袭外国的一套，今后则要根据中国的实际情况努力自己创造。
    最后会上推举马约翰、徐英超、牟作云、杜启武、管玉珊、李德安、李凤楼、齐有义、柯在铄等九人组成全国学联参加世界青年节篮球队评选委员会，五、六两日报名，七、八两日选拔。九日完成球队组织工作，并将于出国前公开表演。
