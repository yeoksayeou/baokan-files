    Chen Yi Calls for Studying Mao Zedong Thought
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th] The Shanghai Colleges and Universities Faculty and Staff Unions held a celebration of liberation and founding conference on the 5th. Over a thousand professors, lecturers, and guests attended. After Chairman Zhou Gucheng reported on the significance of the meeting, Mayor Chen Yi was invited to speak. Mayor Chen Yi first explained that the People's Government's takeover of higher education in Shanghai was conducted entirely through democratic consultation. It not only listened to the opinions of progressive faculty and staff but also considered the more conservative opinions. As for reactionaries, they are required to repent and reform themselves for the people. If some reactionaries believe that our approach of leniency, democracy, and consultation means we are easy to deceive and continue to lie dormant and engage in illegal activities, they will be cutting themselves off from the Chinese people, and we will give them a resolute and merciless blow. Mayor Chen Yi said that a gradual transformation method would be adopted for higher education, retaining and developing what is in line with the interests of the people, and abolishing what violates the interests of the people. Regarding academic research, as long as it does not violate the interests of the people, we will not interfere. Mayor Chen Yi then called on everyone to study Mao Zedong Thought, work hard for the construction of the new China, and consolidate the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War.

  　教职员团体联合会成立
    陈毅号召学习毛泽东思想
    【新华社上海十二日电】上海大专学校教职员团体联合会，五日举行庆祝解放及成立大会。到会教授、讲师及来宾等共一千多人。主席周谷城报告开会意义后，陈毅市长被请讲话。陈市长首先说明：人民政府对上海高等教育的接管，完全是采取民主协商方式。不仅听取进步的教职员的意见，也考虑比较带保守的意见。对于反动分子，则要求他们向人民改过自新。如果某些反动分子认为我们用宽大、民主、协商的方式是老实可欺，继续潜伏做非法活动，则是自绝于中国人民，我们将给以坚决的无情的打击。陈毅市长说，对高等教育将采取逐步改造的办法，符合人民利益的予以保留和发挥，违反人民利益的则必须废除。对于学术研究，只要它是不违背人民利益的，我们便不去干涉。陈市长接着号召大家学习毛泽东思想，努力新中国的建设，来巩固抗日战争和解放战争的胜利。
