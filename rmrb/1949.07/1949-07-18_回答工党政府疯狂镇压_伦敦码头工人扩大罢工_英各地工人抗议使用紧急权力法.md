Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 16th – Reports from various sources: London dockworkers are answering the British government’s mad suppression by expanding the scale of their strike. The number of dockworkers on strike has continued to increase to 14,204 on the 14th, and the number of ships frozen has risen to 140. The strike has won the support of workers across the country. The London Trades Council, with 650,000 members, passed a resolution on the 14th demanding the repeal of the Emergency Powers Act. The Council reiterated that organized workers should cease labor to refuse to break the strike and to demonstrate the solidarity of international trade unions. Various trade unions in the Ealing district of West London sent letters to Attlee expressing their support for the London dockworkers. The tram workers of the Transport and General Workers' Union in the New Cross district of South London, the Confederation of Trade Unions in the Midlands, and the seventh branch of the United Machine Workers' Union in Paisley, Scotland, have all protested Attlee's use of the Emergency Powers Act against the striking dockworkers.

    【新华社北平十六日电】各方报道：伦敦码头工人，以扩大罢工的规模来回答英国政府疯狂的镇压。码头工人罢工人数于十四日已续增至一万四千二百零四人，冻结船只已增至一百四十个。罢工已赢得各地工人的支持。拥有会员六十五万人的伦敦工会委员会，十四日通过决议，要求撤销紧急权力法。该会重申有组织的工人应停止劳动，以拒绝破坏罢工，并表现国际职工会的团结。伦敦西部艾林区各工会致函艾德礼，表示他们支持伦敦码头工人。伦敦南部新十字区运输及各业工人工会所属电车工人、密德兰的工会委员会联合会苏格兰贝斯莱的机器工会联合会第七分会等纷纷抗议艾德礼对罢工的码头工人使用紧急权力法。
