Beijing Municipal Trading Company:

　　Sells Large Quantities of Flour to Stabilize Grain Prices
　　Proactively Adjusts Listed Prices to Prevent Reverse Flow of Gauze

　　Grain: In late June, except for a slight rise in refined grains at the end of the ten-day period, there were no major changes. The thirteen types of grain fell by 0.35% at the end of the ten-day period compared to the beginning. Among them, refined grains rose, and coarse grains fell. Grain sources from the Northwest and Pinghan railways remained smooth, with the former mainly being coarse grains and the latter mainly wheat. The value of the Northeast currency increased, and transportation was inconvenient, requiring transfers, resulting in higher freight costs and reduced grain imports from the Northeast. A small amount of wheat from Jinan and Xuzhou arrived in Beijing in the middle of the ten-day period, but later, due to rising grain prices in the south, some merchants purchased grain and transported it south to areas around Wuxi. At the end of the ten-day period, affected by Shanghai prices and the payment of salaries by various institutions and factories, the prices of wheat flour rose. The Grain Company strengthened its control over the market, continuously selling large quantities of flour in the market from the 29th to July 1st. On July 1st, it sold 7,488 bags of flour and over 400,000 jin of coarse grains, thus stabilizing grain prices.

　　Gauze: Since the rise in prices in Shanghai on the 28th, floating capital flowed from north to south and concentrated in the Tianjin gauze market, and Northeast merchants also purchased large quantities. The prices of gauze from the Second Factory and Wufu rose by about 1,000 yuan. Beijing was also affected by Tianjin, but purchasing power remained low, and prices were consistently lower than in Tianjin. To prevent the reverse flow of materials, the Gauze Company proactively adjusted prices, aiming to be equal to or higher than those in Tianjin. Gauze prices rose by 4.65% at the end of the ten-day period compared to the beginning, and only rose by 0.285% compared to the average price of the previous ten-day period.

　　General Merchandise and Industrial Products: General merchandise and industrial products rose more significantly. A small amount of Shanghai goods arrived in Beijing in the middle of the ten-day period, such as 42 Peony socks and Jian'erchi toothpaste. At that time, these had a slight depressing effect on prices. By the end of the ten-day period, anything produced in Tianjin that could be sold in the south, or whose raw material costs had increased, and Shanghai goods that could not be transported north due to high prices, all rose significantly. Some gauze merchants invested in the department store market, and cotton cloth prices tended to rise, up 60% at the end of the ten-day period compared to the beginning. 45 White sugar rose 40%, triangular alkali rose 29.87%, only matches remained stable, while gasoline was sluggish.

　　The supply and demand changes in various market materials are very small. The main factor in the price fluctuations of industrial products this ten-day period is not the supply and demand relationship of materials in this port, but rather the direct impact of Shanghai prices on Tianjin and Beijing due to the restoration of north-south transportation.

专栏：一旬市场综述

　　平市贸易公司
  　出售大批面粉平稳粮价
    防止纱布倒流主动调整牌价
    粮食：六月下旬，除旬末细粮稍升外，无大变动。十三种粮食，旬末与旬初比，下落百分之○·三五。其中细粮上升，粗粮下降。西北及平汉粮源仍畅，前者以粗粮为主，后者以小麦为主。东北币值提高，且运输不便，中途又须倒换火车，运费较高，致东北粮输入减少。济南、徐州的小麦，旬中有少数到平，后因江南粮价上升，有些商人购粮南运至无锡一带。旬末因上海物价影响，又逢各机关工厂发薪，遂造成小麦面粉的上升。粮食公司对市场加强掌握，二十九至七月一日连续在市场大量抛售面粉，七月一日出售口粉达七千四百八十八袋，粗粮四十余万斤，遂使粮价趋于平稳。
    纱布：自上海二十八日物价上升，由南北上，集中于天津的游资流向纱布市场，东北商亦大量收购，二厂五福日升千元左右。北平受天津影响亦有上升，但仍以购买力不大，价格恒较津市为低。纱布公司为防止物资倒流，主动调整价格，以平于或较高于津市为原则。纱布类旬末与旬初比，上升百分之四·六五，与上旬平均价比仅升百分之○·二八五。
    杂货及工业品：杂货及工业品上升较多，旬中有少数申货来平，如四二牡丹袜子、坚尔齿牙膏等。当时对价格稍有下抑作用。至旬末，凡天津产品可以南销的，或原料上涨的，及申货因价高不能北来的皆上涨较多，并有纱布商投资于百货市场，棉赤趋上涨，旬末与旬初比，升百分之六十。四五车白糖升百分之四十，三角碱面升百分之二九·八七，独火柴平，汽油则疲滞。
    各市场物资的供需变动很小，本旬工业品价格的波动，其主要因素不在本埠物资的供求关系，而是因南北交通恢复，平津直接受到上海物价的带动。（北平市贸易公司通讯组）
