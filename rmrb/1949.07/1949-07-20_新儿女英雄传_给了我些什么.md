What "New Heroes and Heroines" Gave Me
    Wang Zhongyuan

    Although I only read "New Heroes and Heroines" intermittently, it left an extremely deep impression on me, as if I had personally witnessed such a world-shaking struggle; and as if Niu Dashui, Yang Xiaomei, and others had become very familiar to me. I think this must be attributed to the author's successful writing!

    But I don't intend to criticize this work here. I just want to talk about what I got from reading this work – "New Heroes and Heroines."

    First of all, I want to say that this book made me thoroughly understand the question of "who was resisting Japan." During the War of Resistance, due to my ignorance, I only believed that the Kuomintang and the Chongqing government were leading the resistance against Japan. Although I constantly heard that the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, active in the enemy's rear, were making quite a stir, I mistakenly believed that they were not doing much, thinking that "the Eighth Route Army would not be able to defeat Japan." After the victory, the Kuomintang also repeatedly promoted how the "supreme leader" of the Kuomintang led the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan. At that time, I compared the strength of the two sides and indeed felt that the Kuomintang had more soldiers and better weapons, while the Eighth Route Army's equipment was very poor. I was misled by this superficial phenomenon, so I no longer doubted the claim that "the Kuomintang led the victory of the War of Resistance."

    After participating in revolutionary work, although such extremely erroneous thoughts no longer existed, due to the fact that I had always been isolated from this great struggle throughout the entire War of Resistance against Japan, it caused narrowness in my thinking. Although I clearly understood the Kuomintang bandit gang's "negatively resisting Japan and actively opposing communism," and their constant collusion with the Japanese invaders, I still lacked a correct understanding of the historical facts of how the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army led the people in persisting in eight years of arduous struggle in the enemy's rear.

    But "New Heroes and Heroines" clearly told me these things. From the author's pen, I saw how the Chinese Communist Party, in a difficult and cruel environment, organized and led the broad masses of the Chinese people to fight stubbornly against the Japanese invaders, traitors, and Kuomintang reactionaries, and finally defeated the enemy and achieved the final victory. This ironclad historical fact is placed before me, and before all the Chinese people, and it is no longer allowed to be distorted, falsified, or doubted in the slightest.

    Secondly, this work educated me to re-recognize the greatness of the people. Although before this, I already understood the theories of "combining with workers and peasants" and "humbly learning from the working people," because I still had a deep-seated petty-bourgeois sense of superiority, I was not able to integrate well with the masses, let alone humbly learn from them. However, in "New Heroes and Heroines," many great heroes were introduced to me. These heroes were not heroes or generals, but peasants whom I had always looked down upon. People like Hei Lao Cai, Niu Dashui, Yang Xiaomei, and Shuangxi were all of them. They were not only resolute, brave, and unafraid of sacrifice in their struggle against the enemy, but also constantly showed their intelligence and resourcefulness in the struggle against the enemy, using various skillful tactics and strategies to attack and defeat the enemy. In addition, old platoon leaders, Zhao Wugeng, Ai Heshang, Yin Dabo, Wang Shugen's mother... and the broad masses of peasants were also completing glorious heroic acts. Some of them were killed by the enemy, and some risked their lives to protect and rescue our cadres. It was precisely because of the heroic deeds of these thousands upon thousands of brave people that the Chinese people finally overthrew Japanese imperialism!

    All of this is enough to make me deeply reflect and examine myself. Really, in front of these great heroes, an old intellectual like me, full of illnesses, seems too cowardly and insignificant. What qualifications do I have to despise them?

    I soberly recognize the greatness of the peasants – the masses – and I am determined to go among them in the future and humbly learn from them.

    Another point is that from this work, I deeply experienced the greatness of the Communist Party and the noble qualities of being a Communist Party member. Hei Lao Cai, Niu Dashui, Yang Xiaomei, Shuangxi... they are all Communist Party members. From them, I saw all the virtues of Communist Party members. No matter how difficult or dangerous the environment, Communist Party members never bow their heads to difficulties or to the enemy. Just as Hei Lao Cai often said: "Communist Party members are not afraid of hitting nails. The more they hit, the harder they become. They become iron heads and are not afraid of anything." We see in the book that Hei Lao Cai, Niu Dashui, Yang Xiaomei, Shuangxi... these outstanding Communist Party members, whether in battle, on the execution ground, or even under the enemy's guns, always maintain their heroic spirit of preferring death to submission. They can withstand any arduous test, just as all Communist Party members can withstand any arduous test.

    And only the Communist Party can always stand with the people, organize, lead, unite, and educate the broad masses of the Chinese people, and resolutely fight the enemy to the end. Without the Communist Party, the victory of the War of Resistance would simply be impossible.

    Putting these things together with the great victory of the national revolution today, it further confirms that the Communist Party is great.

    Finally, I would like to talk about the writing aspect. In the past few years, I myself have been doing literary and artistic work, and I have also written some things haphazardly, but in recent years, on the one hand, I often feel that there is no subject matter to write about, and on the other hand, I always fantasize that I will eventually write great works. But now, I realize that this kind of thinking is completely wrong. Facts tell me that in such a great era of people's revolution, there are too many themes that constitute literary works. The main problem with the so-called "nothing to write" is still due to the fact that one's own life content is too poor and the ideological field is too empty! Moreover, closing oneself in a study, far away from the masses and the real struggle life, and relying only on a little "inspiration" and "imagination" will never create better works.

    I deeply admire the author of "New Heroes and Heroines" for his rich experience in struggle. He wrote every character so vividly, and every event so reasonably. Especially in the use of literature and language, he not only used the language of the peasants so skillfully and appropriately, but also wrote the texts of writing about the feelings and scenery extraordinarily flexibly and vividly. Reading it from the newspaper or listening to it from the radio is just as vivid and moving. If one has not lived and studied in the struggle of the masses for a long time, how easy would it be to write such a successful work!

    In the future, I am willing to learn from the author's spirit of going deep into the masses and humbly learning the life, thoughts, language, and emotions of the masses, and strive to improve myself in terms of ideology and literary writing, and use literature and art to serve the people!

### “新儿女英雄传”给了我些什么

    “新儿女英雄传”给了我些什么
    王仲元
    虽然只是在断断续续中把“新儿女英雄传”读过了一遍，然而它留给我的印象是极其深刻的，就仿佛我自己目睹了这么一段惊天动地的斗争；又好象牛大水、杨小梅这些人，对于我已经成为很熟悉了似的。这些，我想不能不归功于作者写作的成功吧！
    但我这里并不打算对这部作品来作甚么批评，我只谈谈当我读了这部作品——“新儿女英雄传”——之后，我从它那里得到了些甚么。
    首先我要说，这部书让我彻底弄清“谁在抗日”这个问题。抗战期间，由于自己的无知，只认为国民党、重庆政府领导抗日，对于活跃在敌后地区的共产党、八路军，虽也不断听说闹得挺厉害，但自己却错误地认为他不顶啥事，认为“凭八路军不会打倒日本”。胜利后，国民党又口口声声宣传国民党“最高领袖”怎样领导抗日战争胜利，那时候，自己把两方面的实力比一比，果然觉得国民党兵又多，武器配备又好，而八路军的装备却是很差。我为这一个表面的现象所迷惑，所以对于“国民党领导抗战胜利”的这种说法，便也丝毫不再加以怀疑了。
    参加革命工作以后，虽然这样极端误谬的思想是不再存在了，然而由于在整个抗日战争中，自己始终和这个伟大的斗争隔绝着，因此造成了思想上的偏狭，对于国民党匪帮“清极抗日积极反共”，并且和日寇不断拉拉扯扯的鬼勾当虽然是认识清楚了；可是对于共产党八路军怎样领导人民在敌后坚持八年艰苦斗争的史实，我依然缺少正确的认识。
    而“新儿女英雄传”里却清楚地告诉了我这些。从作者的笔下，我看到了中国共产党，怎样在艰苦残酷的环境里，组织与领导着广大的中国人民，向日寇、汉奸、国民党反动派顽强斗争，终于打败了敌人，取得了最后的胜利。这一段铁一般的史实，摆在我的面前，也摆在全中国人民面前，是再也不容许对它有丝毫歪曲、假借和怀疑了。
    其次，这部作品教育我从新认识了人民底伟大。虽然在这以前，我已经懂得“要和工农结合”、“虚心向工农大众学习”这些理论了，但由于我还存在着很深的小资产阶级自高自大的思想意识，我毕竟不能很好地去和群众结合，更谈不到去虚心向他们学习。然而在“新儿女英雄传”里，却介绍给我许多伟大的英雄人物，这些英雄不是什么豪侠或将军之类，而是一向被自己瞧不起的农民。象黑老蔡、牛大水、杨小梅、双喜等都是。他们不仅对敌人的斗争坚决、英勇、不怕牺牲，而且还在和敌人的斗争中不断地显露出他们的聪明和机智来，应用种种技巧的战术和策略，打击敌人，战胜敌人。此外，象老排长、赵五更、艾和尚、尹大伯、王树根的老娘……以及广大的农民群众，也都在完成着光荣的英雄行为，他们有的被敌人杀害了，有的冒着杀身的危险掩护与营救我们的干部。正因为有了这千千万万勇敢的人民底英雄行为，中国人民才终于打倒了日本帝国主义！
    所有这些，都足以使我深刻地反省与检查到自己，真的，在这些伟大的英雄们之前，象我这样浑身是病的旧知识分子，未免太显得卑怯与渺小了，我有甚么资格轻视他们呢？
    我清醒地认识到农民——群众的伟大，今后要下决心走到他们中间，去虚心向他们学习。
    再有一点，就是从这部作品里，我深切体验到共产党的伟大，和作为一个共产党员的高贵品质。黑老蔡、牛大水、杨小梅、双喜……他们都是共产党员，从他们身上，我看到共产党员所有的一切美德，勿论在任何艰苦危难的环境中，共产党员从来不肯向困难，向敌人低头。正象黑老蔡常说的：“共产党员不怕碰钉子，越碰越硬梆，碰成铁头什么也不怕了。”我们看书中的黑老蔡、牛大水、杨小梅、双喜……这些优秀的共产党员，他们无论是在战斗中，在刑场上，以至在敌人的枪口之下，始终保持着宁死不屈的英雄气节，他们经得起任何艰苦的考验，正和所有的共产党员都经得起任何艰苦的考验是一样的。
    并且也只有共产党，才能够始终不渝地和人民站在一起，组织、领导、团结和教育广大的中国人民，坚决地和敌人斗争到底，如果没有共产党，抗日战争的胜利简直是不可能的。
    把这些，再和今天全国革命的伟大胜利联系起来看，那就越发证实了共产党是伟大的。
    最后，我还要就写作这方面来谈谈。几年来，我自己也是在做着文艺工作的，也曾胡乱写过些东西，可是到了近年来，一方面时常感到没什么题材可写，一方面又总幻想着自己终久会写出伟大的作品来。而现在，我觉察到这种思想认识是完全错误的。事实告诉我：在这样人民革命的大时代里，构成文艺作品的题材是太多了，所谓“没什么可写”，主要症结还是由于自己的生活内容太贫乏，思想领域太空虚底原故啊！并且，把自己关闭在书室里，远远地和群众，和现实的斗争生活脱节，仅仅靠着一点点“灵感”和“想象”，是永远不会创作出较好的作品来的。
    对于“新儿女英雄传”的作者的丰富的斗争生活经验，我十分敬佩，他把每一个人物都写得那么栩栩如生，每一件事情都写得那么入情入理，特别是在文学和语言的运用上，他不但把农民的言语运用得那么熟练自如，恰合其份，就是写情写景的文字，也都是格外的灵活、生动。从报上读，从收音机旁听，都是一样的有声有色，精彩动人。如果不是长期在群众的斗争里生活、学习的话，要写出这样成功的作品，谈何容易！
    今后，我愿意学习作者那种深入群众，虚心学习群众的生活、思想、言语和感情的精神，努力在思想上和文艺写作上提高自己，用文艺来为人民服务！
