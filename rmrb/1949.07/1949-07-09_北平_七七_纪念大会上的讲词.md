　　Speech at the Beiping "July 7th" Commemoration Meeting
    Dong Biwu
    [Beiping City News] The full text of Dong Biwu's speech at the Beiping City People's Commemoration of the 12th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War:

    Today is the 12th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War. This year's "July 7th" makes people even more jubilant. This is because the various demands that the people of the whole country failed to realize nationwide during the Anti-Japanese War have begun to be realized today, with the great victory of the People's Liberation War.

    Twelve years ago, on July 7th, the sound of cannons at Lugou Bridge rang out, and we waged a great patriotic war against the Japanese aggressors. After more than eight years of arduous struggle, we finally achieved the final victory. Today, as we commemorate this victory, we must focus on understanding the origin of this victory.

    Everyone knows that there were two different guiding lines in the Anti-Japanese War, and these two lines have been engaged in sharp struggles. These two different lines are:

    One is the victorious line that can defeat the Japanese aggressors, which is the people's war line advocated by the Chinese Communist Party and supported by all democratic parties and the Chinese people; the other is the line that not only cannot defeat the Japanese aggressors but actually helps the Japanese aggressors and harms the Anti-Japanese War, which is the line implemented by the Kuomintang government of actively opposing the people and passively resisting Japan.

    The victory of the Anti-Japanese War was based on the victory of the former's struggle against the latter. Before the start of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang government's reactionary policy of "domestic pacification before resisting foreign aggression" was first crushed, and the Xi'an Incident laid the foundation for the Anti-Japanese National United Front. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, pessimistic and compromising sentiments such as the "three-month subjugation theory" and the "weaponry-only theory" were crushed, and the determination to resist Japan was strengthened. During the most difficult period of the Anti-Japanese War, when the Kuomintang government actively opposed the people and passively resisted Japan, preparing for compromise and surrender through friction, we put forward the correct slogan of "persist in resistance, oppose surrender; persist in unity, oppose division; persist in progress, oppose regression," repelled three "anti-communist high tides," and persisted in the Anti-Japanese War until the final victory. This final victory is mainly attributable to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, "the heroic fighting of the military and civilians in the liberated areas, the concerted support of the people of the whole country and all democratic parties, and the help of allies, especially the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's dispatch of troops directly eliminated the Japanese invaders. This is the origin of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War."

    Three years ago, the Japanese aggressors surrendered, and the Anti-Japanese War was victorious, but the various demands of the Chinese people in the Anti-Japanese War were not realized. This is because the American imperialists replaced the Japanese aggressors, and Chiang Kai-shek replaced Wang Jingwei. They resolutely opposed the Chinese people.

    The Chinese people demanded national independence in the Anti-Japanese War, but the American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries insisted on making us slaves of American colonies; the Chinese people demanded democratic reforms in the Anti-Japanese War, but the American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries insisted on making us accept Chiang Kai-shek's fascist terror; the Chinese people demanded the realization of domestic peace and national construction after the war, but the American imperialists supported the Kuomintang reactionaries in launching a large-scale civil war. The American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries believed that their strength far exceeded that of the Chinese people. They wanted to seize the fruits of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War for themselves; they wanted to make the Chinese people their slaves forever, as in the past. However, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, tempered themselves in the Anti-Japanese War. They could defeat the Japanese aggressors, and they were confident that they could drive out American imperialism's rule in China; they could defeat Wang Jingwei, and they were confident that they could defeat Chiang Kai-shek. They held high the banner of the People's Liberation War, continued the glorious tradition of the Anti-Japanese War, and waged the great People's Liberation War. In the three years since then, this great People's Liberation War, thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the unanimous support of the people of the whole country, and the united cooperation of all democratic parties, has achieved a basic victory over the Kuomintang reactionary government and reactionary army, mainly supported by American imperialism, in just three years. The final elimination of the Kuomintang reactionaries' remaining forces is imminent. The various demands of the Chinese people in the Anti-Japanese War can be fully realized today and have already begun to be realized. Therefore, today's "July 7th" commemoration makes us even more jubilant, which is natural.

    The Anti-Japanese War has been won, and the People's Liberation War has also been basically won. The issue of a peace treaty with Japan should be placed on our agenda. China is the country that resisted Japanese aggression earliest, longest, and with the greatest sacrifice. We have the right to express our opinions on handling the Japanese issue. We oppose American imperialism's acting arbitrarily, occupying Japan, opposing American imperialism's indefinite postponement of the peace treaty with Japan, cultivating Japanese militarism, and hindering Japan's true democratization. This violates the Potsdam Agreement on handling the Japanese issue. Our New Political Consultative Conference will be held soon and will produce a democratic coalition government. The new democratic coalition government will send its plenipotentiary representatives to participate in the meeting to handle the Japanese issue as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. That will be China's sole plenipotentiary representative.

    We continue to hold high the banner of New Democracy and move forward. No difficulties can stop the Chinese people from uniting and moving forward.

    Celebrate the great victory of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War!

    Celebrate the great victory of the three-year People's Liberation War!

    Support the speedy convocation of the New Political Consultative Conference and the establishment of a democratic coalition government!

    Conclude a peace treaty with Japan quickly in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement!

    The people of China and Japan unite to oppose the long-term occupation of Japan by the United States!

    Build an independent, free, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China!

    Long live the People's Democratic Republic of China!

    Bo Yibo

    [Beiping City News] The full text of Bo Yibo's speech at the Beiping City People's Commemoration of the 12th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War: Compatriots!

    For twelve years, we have commemorated July 7th every year, but this year we feel particularly happy! Why is this? It is because: First, in the past, the Chinese people commemorated July 7th while still under the oppression of imperialism and its running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and felt particularly heavy-hearted. This year, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people's revolution has achieved basic victory nationwide, and the Chinese people have begun to stand up. So we feel particularly happy to commemorate July 7th this year. Second, this year is on the eve of the establishment of the preparatory committee for the New Political Consultative Conference and the upcoming convening of the New Political Consultative Conference. We have forever escaped the status of a colony and semi-colony, and we will establish the People's Democratic Republic of China and establish a democratic coalition government. Third, precisely because of this, our international status has greatly improved, higher than ever before. The state of being enslaved and oppressed by imperialism for a hundred years will end from now on and will never return. The Chinese people have begun to stand up straight and begin to turn over. That's right, fourth, the Chinese people can start a new construction and move towards an independent, democratic, prosperous, peaceful, and happy New China. Now let us shout:

    Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!

    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

    Long live Chairman Mao!

    Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

    Nie Rongzhen

    [Beiping City News] The full text of Nie Rongzhen's speech at the Beiping City People's Commemoration of the 12th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War: Fellow compatriots, fellow comrades:

    The lions on the Lugou Bridge were awakened by the sound of the cannons at Lugou Bridge, roared in anger, and stood up. Today we dare to declare to all domestic and foreign reactionaries and imperialist robbers that the power of the Chinese people is great and the Chinese nation cannot be humiliated.

    Today we have reason, qualifications, and even a warm heart to commemorate this year's "July 7th" with the greatest joy and pleasure, because the Chinese people have achieved a great victory. Not only have we eliminated the enemy in North China, but all reactionaries will soon be eliminated nationwide, and the victory of the whole country will soon come.

    But the achievement of this victory is not easy. We have fought in North China. Let us make a small recollection in this corner of North China: The people of North China and their sons and daughters armed into the North China People's Liberation Army fought the ferocious, brutal, and barbaric Japanese robbers for eight full years. There is no place in North China that is not a battlefield. From the mountains to the plains, from the ground to the underground, the hot blood of the people of North China has been spilled all over the land of North China. All the enemy's evil deeds and the facts of the people of North China's loyalty, patriotism, and heroic sacrifice cannot be described in a few words. In short, the people of North China are worthy of their ancestors, worthy of their descendants, and worthy of their motherland. Under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's strategic policy of the Anti-Japanese War and under the command of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the people of North China and the people of the whole of China persisted in the guerrilla war behind enemy lines, persisted in the all-out resistance, and persisted in the Anti-Japanese National United Front. We persisted in the eight-year Anti-Japanese War and finally defeated Japan in coordination with the Allies. In particular, the Soviet Union's participation in the war and dispatch of troops to China resulted in the defeat of the powerful Japanese Kwantung Army. Our North China People's Liberation Army had a victorious meeting with the Soviet Red Army in Chahar, Rehe, and Northeast China. In these places, all Japanese enemies were completely eliminated, which is an unforgettable event of great historical significance.

    Japan announced its surrender three years ago, and the Jiang-US-Japan also colluded. American imperialism transported the Kuomintang reactionaries' army from the sea, ship by ship, and from the air, group by group, to the Northeast and to North China, attempting to eliminate the People's Liberation Army and the liberated areas, and wanted to swallow the fruits of the people's blood and sacrifice, forcing the people to continue the war. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, leading our people and the People's Liberation Army, resolutely eliminated the Kuomintang reactionaries, led the peasants to carry out land reform, resolutely eliminated feudal exploitation, and consolidated and expanded the People's Democratic United Front, gaining this great victory in just three years. We have completely eliminated the Kuomintang reactionaries in North China.

    On the basis of the great victory of the People's Liberation War, the new political consultative preparatory meeting has been established, and the new political consultative conference is about to be convened. The coalition government—the People's Democratic Republic of China—is about to be realized. The people of North China, especially our North China troops, should follow Chairman Mao's instructions. We are always a fighting team. We should always stand on the fighting post, build our national defense, and be ready at all times to defend the fruits of the people's victory and defend our motherland.

    Ye Jianying

    [Beiping City News] The full text of Ye Jianying's speech at the Beiping City People's Commemoration of the 12th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War:

    Compatriots: Today we commemorate July 7th. First of all, let us sincerely celebrate the great victory of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War and the three-year People's Liberation War! Pay tribute to the People's Liberation Army and its commander-in-chief, Zhu, who defeated the national enemy and the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek! Pay tribute to the Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader Chairman Mao, who led the people of the whole country to liberation!

    Compatriots! The July 7th Incident twelve years ago was the beginning of our nation's most heroic and resolute involvement in the sacred Anti-Japanese War, and therefore also the most arduous struggle. From that day on, we fought bloody battles for eight years, and finally, with the cooperation of various countries, we defeated Japanese fascism and the traitor Wang Jingwei. However, our national liberation cause has been so difficult and has had such twists and turns! We were just driving away the tiger from the front door, and letting the wolf in through the back door. American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek government, brought new and serious disasters to the Chinese people. Not only was the nation not independent, democracy not realized, and the people had no freedom, but the American imperialists took advantage of our eight years of bloody battles to support Chiang Kai-shek with all their strength in launching an anti-people civil war that was even larger than the Anti-Japanese War. Our nation was once again forced to continue the three-year People's Liberation War. Until now, we have finally achieved a basic victory! Compatriots! These are glorious and great twelve years! The Chinese people have overthrown the Chiang Kai-shek government supported by American imperialism, and a people's democratic coalition government is about to be born. The Chinese people have won! We have turned the suffering July 7th into a joyful July 7th. Compatriots! We can and should celebrate our great July 7th with joy today.

    Compatriots! Although we have achieved a definite basic victory, Chiang Kai-shek's remaining forces are still waiting for us to eliminate them. Although we are carrying out our construction in the vast liberated areas, we still have to carry out national-scale construction. Therefore, our commemoration of July 7th this year should: First, resolutely suppress the sabotage and disturbance of reactionary elements and eliminate hidden secret agents and spies. Because the reactionary party's open armed struggle against the Chinese people has failed, they have turned to covert and illegal struggles. The enemy often takes advantage of the gaps and aims at places and times that we do not pay much attention to, spreading rumors, poison, setting fires, firing guns, and carrying out various sabotages; or printing counterfeit money, disrupting finance, and inciting labor-capital disputes to undermine production and carry out various disturbances. Therefore, only by raising our vigilance and resolutely eliminating the remaining forces of Chiang Kai-shek can we maintain the people's security, protect the people's property, and guarantee the construction of the new China.

    Second, we must call on the male and female workers in Beiping, the farmers in the suburbs, the staff, technical experts, patriotic industrialists, personnel in transportation departments, trade departments, and members of supply and marketing cooperatives to unite highly, organize themselves, and actively participate in the construction of the new China, and strive to develop production and prosper the economy; Similarly, cultural and educational, scientific, and artistic workers in Beiping City must unite highly, organize themselves, and actively participate in the construction of the new China, and strive to restore and develop the people's cultural, educational, scientific, and artistic undertakings. This is the first meaning of our commemoration of July 7th today.

    Compatriots! The victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause is the failure of American imperialism's reactionary policy in China. However, American imperialists, like Chiang Kai-shek, are not willing to fail. Chiang Kai-shek has been driven out of mainland China by the Chinese people, but they can still be accommodated by American imperialism and exiled to islands, and can send planes to indiscriminately bomb the people's cities. This is not enough! American imperialists attempt to occupy Japan for a long time, seize our Taiwan by force, and are rebuilding Japan's war machine, wanting to turn Japan into a reactionary center for the United States in the Far East and a base for the United States to invade Asia. Therefore, the second meaning of our commemoration of July 7th this year is to mobilize national strength and take effective measures to prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism and fascism and re-aggression against China. Therefore, we advocate the rapid conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, eradicating Japanese militarism, promoting the emergence of a democratic Japan, and ensuring that Japan no longer threatens China or disturbs world peace. We support the proposal made by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky at the Sixth Foreign Ministers' Conference to prepare for a peace treaty with Japan. We oppose the erroneous opinion of US Secretary of State Acheson, who advocated that the Far East Commission, rather than the Foreign Ministers' Conference, should prepare for the peace treaty with Japan, and attempted to delay the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan and prolong the occupation of Japan by various excuses. We demand that plenipotentiary representatives of the soon-to-be-born democratic coalition government participate in the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, in order to lift the occupation of American imperialism and establish a democratic Japan. This is consistent with the wishes of the Japanese people and even the wishes of peace-loving and democratic people all over the world. After the defeat of the fascist militarist rule, the people's democratic activities in Japan have developed rapidly. The organization of the Japanese Communist Party, the progressive trade union organization, the democratic organization of farmers, and the unity and organization of progressive intellectuals are all developing. Precisely because of this, MacArthur directed the reactionary government of Yoshida to unscrupulously deprive the Japanese people of their democratic freedoms, implement police terror, and suppress the Japanese people's democratic movement. The people of China and Japan must unite to jointly oppose the long-term occupation of Japan by the United States and oppose the American imperialists from guiding Japan once again on the path of fascist aggression that it has already perished from. Only a democratic Japan can rebuild the true friendship and cooperation between the people of China and Japan and maintain peace in the Far East.

    American imperialism's reactionary cosmopolitan policy shows that it is a threat to world peace, and therefore also a threat to peace in the Far East. In order to jointly defend the Far East from aggressors, we support the Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance. The people of China and the Soviet Union must unite to jointly defend the Far East from aggressors. This is the third meaning of our commemoration of July 7th this year.

    Compatriots! There is a fourth meaning to commemorate July 7th this year. We should commemorate July 7th this year with unprecedented excitement and joy, because today, our people's liberation cause has definitely achieved a basic victory, and more than 280 million of our people are already engaged in the great construction cause in their own liberated homeland. Therefore, we must also use the spirit of battle to mobilize the strength of the whole country to participate in the construction of our great motherland. Our motherland is one of the largest and oldest countries in the world. Our territory exceeds the whole of Europe, our population accounts for a quarter of the world's population, our nation's history has stretched for more than 5,000 years, our ancestors had many great thinkers, scientists, politicians, and military strategists. As early as 3,000 years ago, our ancestors invented the compass, 1,700 years ago they invented papermaking, 1,200 years ago they invented block printing, and 800 years ago, they invented movable type printing. Our ancestors were also the first in the world to invent gunpowder. In our country, there is also the Great Wall that traverses east and west, and the Grand Canal that runs through north and south. There are many buildings, handicrafts, and cultural arts that are still praised by people all over the world.

    Compatriots: Our motherland is great, and our nation is wise, brave, and hardworking! The era we are in is not only the time when we defeated the counter-revolutionaries at home and established a people's democratic dictatorship, and the People's Democratic Republic of China will soon be born, but also the time when the forces of peace and democracy in the international arena have greatly exceeded the forces of imperialism. This guarantees that our country can enter a long-term historical stage of peaceful construction. On the other hand, we also have the Soviet Union, which masters the world's most advanced science and is engaged in socialist construction, as our example, giving us its experience and help. Therefore, we have ample conditions to build our great motherland in new and new ways. Compatriots! This is the new meaning of commemorating "July 7th" in a new environment and under new conditions.

    We shout: Attack Taiwan and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!

    Long live the People's Democratic Republic of China!

    Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

    Li Jishen

    [Beiping City News] The full text of Li Jishen's speech at the Beiping City People's Commemoration of the 12th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War: Fellow compatriots:

    Today marks the twelfth anniversary of the July 7th Anti-Japanese War. We commemorate July 7th every year, but our mood today is very different from the past. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we commemorated July 7th with an inevitable feeling of worry, because the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group wavered from time to time, colluding with Japanese warlords and the puppet government. From time to time, it attacked the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and all the people's guerrilla forces, suppressed all progressive, democratic, and patriotic people, and weakened the strength of the resistance. During the three years of the People's Liberation War, we commemorated July 7th with an inevitable feeling of anger, because the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group plundered the fruits of the Anti-Japanese War, acted perversely, sold out the country and harmed the people, dragged China into the abyss, and made the nation a slave of imperialism again. But from now on, we will only commemorate July 7th with excitement and jubilation! Because after these three years of liberation war, the forces by which the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, supported by American imperialism, committed evil have been defeated, and the fruits of the Anti-Japanese War have returned to the hands of the people.

    Without the eight years of sacrifice and struggle of the entire Chinese people, there would be no victory in the Anti-Japanese War, and without the three years of sacrifice and struggle of the entire Chinese people, it would be impossible to recover the fruits of the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, we must solemnly express our condolences to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country and the people in the past twelve years! We must sincerely pay our respects to the soldiers who have worked hard and struggled in the past twelve years! We want to thank Mr. Mao Zedong, the teacher of the Chinese people's revolution!

    We must not only ensure the fruits of the national revolution and the democratic revolution, but also expand and develop these fruits. Therefore, the entire Chinese people must unite under the united front, unite under the people's democratic government that will soon be established, eradicate the reactionary remnants internally, build an industrialized new China, and externally support the world's anti-imperialist democratic and peaceful front, strive to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism and strive for Japan's democratization, strive against imperialist aggression and strive for the national liberation of all colonies, and strive for the victory of the people of all imperialist countries!

    Finally, we shout: Long live the victory of the Chinese national revolution! Long live the victory of the Chinese people's revolution!

    Shen Junru

    [Beiping City News] The full text of Shen Junru's speech at the Beiping City People's Commemoration of the 12th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War: Fellow compatriots:

    Today, we are holding an expanded commemoration of "July 7th" in front of Tiananmen Square in Beiping, and I think everyone must be very happy.

    Looking back on this day twelve years ago, the future of our country was pitch black. Our compatriots were oppressed by the Chiang Kai-shek government on the one hand and faced the aggression of Japanese fascists on the other. I myself was still in a Suzhou prison at the time.

    But the gunfire at Lugou Bridge finally broke through the depressing atmosphere at the time. The power of the people forced the Nanjing reactionary government to unite with the Chinese Communist Party to launch a full-scale Anti-Japanese War. This Anti-Japanese War was the beginning of the Chinese people's liberation movement. This shot opened the shackles on the Chinese people and also opened the door of our Suzhou prison, so I was temporarily able to regain my freedom.

    Now everyone understands. Without the Chinese Communist Party, there would be no "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, and China would have been given away by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei long ago. The Chinese Communist Party not only first called for unity and resistance to Japan twelve years ago, but also insisted on resisting to the end after the start of the Anti-Japanese War, opposed compromise and surrender, and waged a resolute struggle against the reactionaries and surrenderers in the Kuomintang. This is how we were able to support the Anti-Japanese War for eight years and two months and achieve the final victory.

    Although the Anti-Japanese War was nominally victorious four years ago, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the Chinese people, got rid of Japanese imperialism, and brought in American imperialism. Thanks to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the struggle of the People's Liberation Army for the past three years, the triple shackles of the Chinese people have been completely opened again. Looking at the dozens of red flags flying on the city walls and the cheers of hundreds of thousands of people in front of the square today, it can be proved that the Chinese people have broken free from the triple shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and a brand-new new democratic New China has emerged. In this situation, how can we not be excited and happy. Everything is of course relying on the strength of all our people, but we especially want to thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and thank the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. Salute!

    Today, although we are celebrating victory, the work ahead of us is still arduous and distant. The remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries have not been eliminated, and the construction of all economic, cultural, and educational fields has just begun. We must continue to work hard under the leadership of the CCP to complete the construction of the new China that we expect.

    At the same time, today we should also think that the Japanese invaders once chanted the slogan of the "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere," and they wanted to enslave and exploit the weak nations in the Pacific. Although Japan has surrendered, the weak nations have not been liberated. Imperialism now wants to support the Japanese warlords and make a comeback. There is no peaceful scene in the Pacific at all. Striving for peace in the Pacific to safeguard world peace, this responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the Chinese people. The people in the Pacific are also eagerly hoping for us, hoping that the new China will grow rapidly to ensure peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, we must take on the responsibility of defending peace in the Pacific.

    All parties and groups participating in the preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference issued a declaration to commemorate the 12th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, especially pointing out that we must prepare for a peace treaty with Japan in accordance with the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. The purpose is to rebuild peace in the Pacific and oppose the vicious plan of American imperialism to use Japan as a base for aggression. I believe that this declaration will definitely be supported by the entire Chinese people and by the peace-loving people of all countries in the world.

    In short, eliminating the remaining forces of the domestic reactionaries, starting the peaceful construction of New Democracy, and then establishing peace in the Pacific are the goals that we should all strive for today. In order to achieve these goals, I am willing to shout:

    The entire Chinese people unite!

    Support the "July 7th" declaration of all parties and groups!

    Support the Chinese Communist Party!

    Long live the People's Democratic Republic of China!

    Guo Moruo

    [Beiping City News] The full text of Guo Moruo's speech at the Beiping City People's Commemoration of the 12th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War:

    Today, as we commemorate the 12th anniversary of "July 7th", we must first pay tribute to the great people's leader Chairman Mao! Pay tribute to the Chinese Communist Party! Pay tribute to the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Pay tribute to the working class and peasant masses of the whole country!

    With the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, we had the Anti-Japanese War. With the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, after eight years of work, we defeated Japanese imperialism, and after three years of work, we defeated Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism, so that we can enjoy the fruits of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The martyrs who sacrificed for the motherland in this twelve-year long war will be immortal forever. During this twelve-year long war, the hardworking and brave workers and peasants, who constantly increased production and supported the front line, have become the masters of the new China today!

    Our Chinese people have turned over, and soon we will establish a people's democratic coalition government led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance.

    It is a coincidence! Fellow compatriots, please see, don't the two characters "七七" ("July 7th") represent the dual combination of workers and peasants? Doesn't it represent the dual combination of hammer and sickle, hammer and sickle?

    As we commemorate "July 7th," we should unite even more to eliminate all domestic and foreign enemies! Attack Taiwan and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive! Attack Guangzhou, attack Chongqing, attack Nanzheng, and capture all the chief war criminals alive! Overthrow all imperialist conspiracies of aggression and drive all imperialist forces of aggression out of China!

    As we commemorate "July 7th," we should unite even more to convene the new political consultative conference quickly, establish a democratic coalition government quickly, and conclude a peace treaty with Japan quickly in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement! Realize the non-militarization of Japan, realize the democratization of Japan, oppose the conspiracy of American imperialism to revive Japan's aggressive forces, and oppose all the selfish, arbitrary, and reactionary policies of American imperialism towards Japan!

    As we commemorate "July 7th," we should unite even more to uphold the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. With the close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, we will jointly defend against aggressors in the Far East, participate in the world's peaceful and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and cooperate closely with the forces of the people all over the world to jointly oppose the conspiracy of the imperialist warmongers to provoke a new world war!

    As we commemorate "July 7th," we should unite even more to develop production, prosper the economy, restore transportation, develop education, and engage in active construction in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and national defense, and quickly establish an independent, free, peaceful, and unified new China! Smoothly rising from New Democracy to the higher stage of socialist communism!

    Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!

    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

    Long live Chairman Mao!

    Xu Deheng

    [Beiping City News] The full text of Xu Deheng's speech at the Beiping City People's Commemoration of the 12th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War: Dear compatriots!

    Today marks the twelfth anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War! Today, as we commemorate this great day, especially in liberated Beiping, we should first pay tribute to the Chinese Communist Party and the great and wise leader Chairman Mao, who insisted on the correct proposition of the "Anti-Japanese National United Front" at that time!

    Everyone knows that without the power of people's democracy and unity, China's reactionary rulers at the time would not have resisted Japan. After the "September 18th" Incident, the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek, like the traitor Wang Jingwei, advocated surrendering to Japan. Their policy of non-resistance at the time, the policy of "resistance and negotiation," dear compatriots, you may still remember it. They said that "Japan can destroy China in three days," and that China's weapons are not as good as Japan's and cannot fight Japan. They also said that China would have to wait fifty years before it could talk about resisting Japan! Perhaps the compatriots present today still remember these kinds of nonsense! Just as the Japanese imperialists launched the "September 18th" war of aggression against China, Chiang Kai-shek's guns were firing inward, and as the Japanese invaders' iron hooves penetrated deeper into Chinese territory, Chiang Kai-shek's internal massacre became more frantic and fierce! At that time, being patriotic was a crime, and resisting Japan was illegal. There are many such examples. There is no time to list them today. Just take Tiananmen Square as an example! In the past, it was often a place where armed military police fought with patriotic students and patriotic citizens. Compared with today's warm, harmonious, banner-waving, and song-filled situation, it really makes me cry with joy!

    Due to the correct guidance of the Chinese Communist Party's "Anti-Japanese National United Front," the Chinese people were united. After eight years and two months of the national Anti-Japanese heroic struggle, suffering unprecedented sacrifice and hardship, we finally defeated Japanese imperialism, and the Japanese invaders surrendered to us!

    Due to Chiang Kai-shek's consistent and uninterrupted anti-revolutionary civil war of massacring the Chinese people during the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, after the end of the Anti-Japanese military, he seized the fruits of the people's victory and offered them to the American imperialists with both hands. Trumanism America is already the pre-war Japanese imperialism without discount, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is even more ugly and violent than the wartime traitor Wang Jingwei. Over the past three years, American imperialism has not only helped Chiang Kai-shek massacre the Chinese people with large quantities of munitions, money, weapons, and a large number of military combat personnel, but has also actively supported Japanese warlords and Japanese reactionaries, attempting to use Japan as a military base for invading the world and threatening peace in the Far East. To use the Japanese warlords and reactionaries as their hunting dogs for carrying out aggression, and to use the Japanese people as cannon fodder for military aggression!

    Recently, they have become even more desperate and have not hesitated to unilaterally suspend Japan's reparations to China. Reject the Soviet Union's proposal to invite China to prepare for a peace treaty with Japan. And they vainly attempt to seize our Taiwan and Hainan Island and use them as their permanent naval and air military bases to threaten world peace.

    Today, as we commemorate "July 7th," first, we should know that the Chinese people once defeated Japanese imperialism with the power of unity. For three years, thanks to the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army, the reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing has been destroyed. In order to realize permanent peace, we believe that we will further tighten unity in the future, unite around the Chinese Communist Party, thoroughly eliminate the reactionary remnants, and establish a people's democratic new China!

    Second, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that we should unite with nations in the world that treat us equally and struggle together to consolidate world peace. We must also unite all peace-loving countries and their people, strengthen unity, and unite around the Soviet Union, the fortress of world peace and democracy, and crush the imperialists' and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek's war dreams!

    Third, in order to commemorate "July 7th," we must today resolutely oppose the aggression group headed by US imperialism, monopolize Japan, support the remnants of Japanese fascists, and attempt to launch another war of aggression. We advocate the rapid conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, ending MacArthur's rule over Japan, and the rapid departure of the United States from Japan!

    Compatriots, unity is strength

　　北平“七七”纪念大会上的讲词
    董必武
    【平市讯】董必武在北平市各界人民纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年大会上的讲演词，全文如下：
    今天是“七七”抗日战争十二周年的纪念日。今年的“七七”使人更加欢欣鼓舞。这就是因为全国人民在抗日战争中所没有能够在全国范围内实现的种种要求，在人民解放战争伟大胜利的今天，都已开始实现了。
    在十二年前，七月七日，芦沟桥的炮声响了，我们对日本侵略者进行了伟大的爱国战争。经过了八年多的苦战，终于取得了最后的胜利。今天我们纪念这一个胜利，要着重了解这一胜利的由来。
    谁都知道：抗日战争中有两条不同的指导路线，这两条路线一直进行着尖锐的斗争。这两条不同的路线：
    一条是：能够打败日本侵略者的胜利的路线，这就是中国共产党所倡导的，各民主党派和中国人民所拥护的人民战争的路线；另一条路是：不但不能打败日本侵略者的，而且实际上帮助日本侵略者的，危害抗日战争的路线，这就是国民党政府所实行的积极反人民、消极抗战的路线。
    抗日战争的胜利，就是基于前者对后者斗争的胜利。在抗日战争开始之前，首先粉碎了国民党政府“攘外必先安内”的反动政策，经过西安事变，才奠定了抗日民族统一战线的基础。抗日战争开始，又粉碎了“三月亡国论”“唯武器论”等悲观妥协情绪，坚定了抗战的决心。在抗日战争最困难的时期，在国民党政府，积极反人民，消极抗战，以磨擦准备妥协投降的时期，我们又提出：“坚持抗战，反对投降；坚持团结，反对分裂；坚持进步，反对倒退”的正确口号，打退三次“反共高潮”，将抗日战争坚持到最后胜利。这一个最后胜利，主要是要归功于中国共产党毛主席的英明领导，“解放区军民的英勇善战，全国人民全国各民主党派协力支持的结果，又加上了盟友的帮助，特别是苏联的帮助，苏联的出兵直接消灭日寇。这就是抗日战争胜利之所由来。”
    三年前，日本侵略者投降了，抗日战争胜利了，但是中国人民在抗日战争中的种种要求没有得到实现。这是因为美帝国主义者代替了日本侵略者，蒋介石代替了汪精卫。他们坚决的与中国人民为敌。
    中国人民在抗日战争中要求民族独立，但是美国帝国主义和国民党反动政府，硬要我们做美国殖民地的奴隶；中国人民在抗日战争中要求民主改革，但是美帝国主义和国民党反动政府，硬要我们接受蒋介石的法西斯恐怖；中国人民在抗日战争中要求在战后实现国内和平和国家建设，但是美帝国主义支持国民党反动政府发动了大规模的内战。美帝国主义者和国民党反动政府以为他们的力量远远的超过中国人民的力量，他们想把抗日战争的胜利果实攫为己有；他们想把中国人民象过去一样的永远作他们的奴隶。但是中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，在抗日战争中锻炼了自己，他们能战胜日本侵略者，他们自信就能驱逐美帝国主义在中国的统治；他们能打垮汪精卫，他们自信一定能打垮蒋介石。他们高举着人民解放战争的旗帜，继续抗日战争的光荣传统，进行了伟大的人民解放战争。三年以来，这一个伟大的人民解放战争，由于中国共产党毛主席的英明领导，由于中国人民解放军的英勇善战，由于全国人民的一致拥护，由于各民主党派的团结协力，仅仅在三年的时间，就对主要由美帝国主义支持的国民党反动政府和反动军队，取得了基本的胜利。国民党反动派残余力量的最后肃清，已经为时很近了。中国人民在抗日战争中的种种要求，在今天就完全可能实现，并且已经在开始实现了。因此，今天的“七七”纪念，使得我们更加欢欣鼓舞，这是当然的。
    抗日战争胜利了，人民解放战争也基本胜利了，对日和约问题就应当摆在我们的议事日程上。我们中国是抵抗日本侵略最早最久而又牺牲最大的国家，我们有权提出处理日本问题的意见，我们反对美帝国主义一意孤行，霸占日本，反对美帝国主义无限期拖延对日和约，培植日本军国主义，阻碍日本真正民主化，这是违反波茨坦处理日本问题的协定的。我们的新政治协商会议就要开会，就要产生民主联合政府，新的民主联合政府，就要派出它的全权代表，参与照波茨坦协定所规定处理日本问题的会议，那将是中国的唯一全权代表。
    我们继续高举着新民主主义的旗帜前进，没有任何困难能阻止住中国人民团结起来的前进。
    庆祝八年抗日战争的伟大胜利！
    庆祝三年人民解放战争的伟大胜利！
    拥护迅速召开新政协，成立民主联合政府！
    迅速按照波茨坦协定，缔结对日和约！
    中日两国人民联合起来反对美国长期占领日本！
    建设独立的、自由的、和平的、统一的、富强的新中国！
    中华人民民主共和国万岁！
    薄一波
    【平市讯】薄一波在北平市各界人民纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年大会上的讲演词，全文如下：同胞们！
    十二年来，年年纪念七七，今年感到特别愉快！这为什么？是由于：第一，过去中国人民纪念七七依然是在帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派压迫之下来纪念的，感到特别沉重。今年则是在毛主席、中国共产党领导下，中国人民革命已经在全国范围内取得了基本胜利，中国人民已经开始翻身了。所以我们今年纪念七七感到特别愉快。第二，今年是在新政协筹备会已经成立，新政协行将召开的前夜，我们已永远脱离殖民地半殖民地的地位，我们要成立中华人民民主共和国，要成立民主联合政府。第三，正由于这样，我们在国际上的地位大大提高了，从来没有这样高，一百年来被帝国主义奴役压迫的状态将从此结束，一去不复返，中国人民开始伸起腰来，开始翻身了。正是这样，第四，中国人民可以开始新的建设，走向独立，民主，繁荣，和平，幸福的新中国。现在让我们高呼：
    中华人民解放万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    聂荣臻
    【平市讯】聂荣臻在北平市各界人民纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年大会上的讲演词，全文如下：各界同胞们，各位同志们：
    芦沟桥上的狮子随着芦沟桥的炮声惊醒了，怒嚎了，站起来了，我们今天敢于向中外的一切反动派帝国主义强盗们宣称，中国人民力量是伟大的，中华民族是不可侮的。
    我们今天有理由，有资格，更有一颗热烈的心儿，最高兴，最愉快的来纪念今年的“七七”，因为中国人民取得了伟大的胜利，不仅我们在华北肃清了敌人，而且一切反动派在全国范围内即将被肃清，全国的胜利不久就要到来。
    但是这个胜利的取得是不容易的，我们曾经战斗在华北，让我们在这个华北角落来做一个小小的回忆吧：华北的人民和他们的子弟所武装起来的华北人民解放军，和凶恶的残暴的野蛮的日本强盗整整厮杀了八年，华北没有一个地方不是战场，从山上到平原，从地面到地下，华北人民的热血洒遍在全华北的土地上。所有一切敌人罪恶的行为，和华北人民忠勇爱国英勇牺牲的事实，绝非三言两语所能形容的。总之，华北人民对得起祖先，对得起后代，对得起祖国。华北人民和全中国人民在中国共产党毛主席的抗日战争战略方针的指导之下，在朱总司令的指挥下坚持敌后游击战争，坚持全面抗战，坚持抗日民族统一战线，我们坚持了八年的抗战，最后配合盟国打败了日本，特别是苏联的参战，出兵中国，首先是强大的日本关东军被打败了，我们华北的人民解放军曾在察哈尔、在热河、在东北与苏联红军胜利会师，在这些地方，曾经全部肃清了日本敌人，这是不可忘记的有历史重大意义的。
    日本宣布投降了，蒋美日也合流了，美国帝国主义将国民党反动派的军队从海上一船一船的，从空中一群一群的向东北运来，向华北运来，企图消灭解放军，消灭解放区，想吞并人民流血牺牲所换来的果实，迫使人民不能不继续战争，在中国共产党毛主席的领导之下，领导我们人民和解放军，坚决消灭国民党反动派，领导农民实行土地改革、坚决的消灭封建剥削，巩固与扩大人民民主统一战线，整整三年的时间获得了这种伟大的胜利，我们在华北已把国民党反动派全部肃清了。
    在人民解放战争的伟大胜利基础之上，新的政治协商筹备会议已经成立，新的政治协商会议即将召开。联合政府——中华人民民主共和国即将实现，我们华北的人民，特别是我们华北的部队应遵照毛主席的指示，我们永远是一个战斗队，我们应当永远站在战斗的岗位上，建设我们的国防，时刻准备着保卫人民胜利的果实，保卫我们的祖国。
    叶剑英
    【平市讯】叶剑英在北平市各界人民纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年大会上的讲演词，全文如下：
    同胞们：今天我们纪念七七，首先让我们衷心的庆祝八年抗日战争及三年人民解放战争的伟大胜利！向战胜民族敌人和人民公敌蒋介石的人民解放军及其统帅朱总司令致敬！向领导全国人民获得解放的中国共产党及人民领袖毛主席致敬！
    同胞们！十二年前的七七是我们民族历史上最英勇最坚决投入神圣抗日战争，因而也是最艰苦的斗争的开端。从那一天起，我们血战了八年，终于得到了各国的协力，战胜了日本法西斯和汉奸汪精卫。然而我们民族解放事业竟有这样的艰难，竟有这样的曲折！我们正是前门拒虎，后门进狼，美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石政府给中国人民带来了新的严重的灾难，不仅仅是民族没有独立，民主没有实现，人民没有自由，而美帝国主义者却乘我们八年血战之余，用全力支持蒋介石发动比抗日战争还要大得多的反人民的内战，我们民族再一次被迫的继续进行三年人民解放战争。直到现在，我们终于获得了基本的胜利！同胞们！这是光荣伟大的十二年！中国人民推翻了美帝国主义所支持的蒋介石政府，就要产生人民的民主联合政府，中国人民胜利了！我们把苦难的七七变为欢乐的七七，同胞们！我们今天可以，而且应该用欢乐的心情来庆祝我们伟大的七七。
    同胞们！我们虽然获得确定的基本的胜利，但蒋介石的残余势力，还待我们去肃清，我们虽然在广大的解放区，进行着我们的建设，但还要进行全国规模的建设。因此，我们今年纪念七七就要：第一，坚决镇压反动分子的破坏和捣乱，肃清暗藏的特务和间谍，因为反动派反对中国人民的公开的武装斗争已经失败，他们就转入到隐蔽的非法的斗争，敌人经常乘间抵隙的，针对着我们不十分注意的地方和我们不十分注意的时间，便放谣，放毒，放火，放枪，进行各种破坏；或者印制假钞，扰乱金融，挑拨劳资纠纷破坏生产，进行各种捣乱，因此，我们只有提高警惕，坚决肃清蒋介石的残余势力，才能维持人民的治安，保护人民的财产，保障新中国的建设。
    第二，我们要号召北平的男女工人们，市郊的农民们，职员们，技术专家们，爱国的产业家们，交通部门、贸易部门的工作人员们，供销合作社的社员们，高度的团结起来，组织起来，积极参加新中国的建设，为发展生产，繁荣经济而奋斗；同样，北平市文化教育、科学、艺术工作者们要高度的团结起来，组织起来，积极参加新中国的建设，为恢复和发展人民文化、教育、科学、艺术事业而奋斗，这就是我们今天纪念七七第一个意义。
    同胞们！中国人民解放事业的胜利，就是美帝国主义者在华反动政策的失败，可是美帝国主义者正和蒋介石一样，并不因此失败而甘心的，蒋介石已被中国人民赶出中国大陆，但他们仍然能够得到美帝国主义的收容，流亡海岛，并且能够派遣飞机，滥炸人民的城市。这还不够！美帝国主义者，企图长期占领日本，强占我台湾，正在重建日本战争机构，想把日本变成为美国在远东反动的中心，成为美国侵略亚洲的基地。因此我们今年纪念七七第二个意义就是要动员全国力量，采取有效的措施，来防止日本军国主义法西斯的再起和对华再侵略。因此，我们主张按照波茨坦协定迅速缔结对日和约，根除日本军国主义，促进民主日本的产生，确保日本不再威胁中国，扰乱世界和平，我们拥护第六届外长会议上苏联外长维辛斯基提出准备对日和约的提议，我们反对美国国务卿艾奇逊的错误意见，他主张由远东委员会，而不是由外长会议，来准备对日和约，并且企图用各种借口来拖延对日和约准备，延长对日本的占领。我们要求派遣即将诞生的民主联合政府全权代表参加缔结对日和约，以便解除美帝国主义的占领，建立民主的日本，这是与日本人民的志愿，乃至与全世界和平民主人士的志愿一致的。日本人民，在法西斯军国主义统治失败后，人民民主活动，有迅速的发展，日本共产党的组织，进步的职工会组织，农民的民主组织，和进步的知识分子的团结和组织，都在发展中。正是因为这样，麦克阿瑟乃指导吉田反动政府，肆无忌惮地剥夺日本人民的民主自由，实行警察恐怖、镇压日本人民民主运动。中日两国人民，必须联合起来共同反对美国长期占领日本，反对美帝国主义者，引导日本再一次的踏上曾经由此而覆灭的法西斯的侵略的道路，只有民主的日本，才能重建中日两国人民的真正的友谊和合作，维护远东的和平。
    美帝国主义反动的世界主义的政策，显出是世界和平的威胁，因而也就是远东和平的威胁，为了共同防御远东的侵略者，我们拥护中苏友好同盟，中苏两国人民，必须联合起来，共同防御远东侵略者，这就是我们今年纪念七七的第三个意义。
    同胞们！今年纪念七七，还有第四个意义，我们应该用从来没有的兴奋和喜悦，来纪念今年的七七，这就是因为今天，我们人民解放的事业，已经确定的获得了基本的胜利，我们两万万八千万以上的人民，已经在自己的解放了的国土上，从事于伟大的建设事业。因此，我们同样要用战斗的精神，动员全国的力量，参加我们伟大祖国的建设。我们祖国是世界上一个最大最古的国家。我们的领土，超过整个欧洲，我们的人口，占全世界四分之一，我们民族的历史，已经绵延了五千余年，我们的祖先，有许多伟大的思想家、科学家、政治家与军事家，远在三千年前，我们祖先就发明了指南针，一千七百年以前发明了造纸法，一千二百年以前发明了刻板印刷术，八百年前，更发明了活字印刷，在世界上首先发明火药的，也是我们的祖先。在我们国内，尚有横亘东西的万里长城，尚有贯通南北的运河，有许多至今仍为全世界人士所称赞的建筑物、手工业和文化艺术。
    同胞们：我们祖国是伟大的，我们的民族是智慧的，勇敢的，勤劳的！我们所处的时代，不仅是在国内战胜了反革命，建立了人民民主专政的政权，中华人民民主共和国很快就要诞生，而且在国际上和平民主势力，已经大大的超过帝国主义的势力，这样，就保证了我们国家能够进入和平建设的长远的历史阶段，另一方面，我们又有掌握着世界上最进步的科学，正从事于社会主义建设的苏联，做我们的榜样，给我们的经验和帮助。因此，我们完全有足够的条件，来新而又新的建设我们伟大的祖国，同胞们！这就是我们在新的环境，新的条件之下，来纪念“七七”的新的意义。
    我们高呼：打到台湾去，活捉蒋介石！
    中华人民民主共和国万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    李济深
    【平市讯】李济深在北平市各界人民纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年大会上的讲演词，全文如下：各界同胞们：
    七七抗战到今天，整整十二年了。每一年我们都纪念七七，但今天的纪念，我们的心情和过去是大不相同的。在八年的抗日战争期间，我们纪念七七总不免带着忧虑的心情，因为蒋介石反动集团时时动摇，向日本军阀和汉奸政府勾搭。时时打击八路军、新四军和一切人民的游击队，压迫一切进步的民主的爱国的人士，削弱了抗战的力量。在三年来的人民解放战争期间，我们纪念七七又不免带着愤怒的心情，因为蒋介石反动集团掠夺了抗战的果实，倒行逆施，卖国害民，把中国拖进了深渊，把民族再做帝国主义的奴隶。但从今以后，我们纪念七七只有兴奋，只有狂欢！因为经过这三年的解放战争，在美帝国主义支持之下蒋介石反动集团借以作恶的势力已被打垮了，抗战的果实回到人民手上了。
    没有全中国人民的八年牺牲奋斗，不可能有抗战的胜利，没有全中国人民的三年牺牲奋斗，也不可能收回抗战的果实。因此，我们要严肃地向十二年来为国家人民而牺牲生命的烈士们致其哀思！要亲切地向十二年来努力奋斗的战士们致其敬意！我们要感谢中国人民革命的导师毛泽东先生！
    我们不但要确保民族革命民主革命的果实，还要扩大发展这一果实。因此，全中国人民必须团结在统一战线之下，团结在将来快要成立的人民民主政府之下，对内则根绝反动残余，建设工业化的新中国，对外则支持世界的反帝国主义的民主和平阵线，为制止日本军国主义的复活和争取日本民主化而奋斗，为反对帝国主义的侵略和争取各殖民地的民族解放而奋斗，为争取各帝国主义国家的人民胜利而奋斗！
    最后，我们高呼：中国民族革命胜利万岁！中国人民革命胜利万岁！
    沈钧儒
    【平市讯】沈钧儒在北平市各界人民纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年大会上的讲演词，全文如下：各位同胞：
    今天在北平天安门前，来开扩大纪念“七七”的大会，我想大家一定非常高兴。
    回想十二年前的今天，我们的国家的前途漆黑一片。我们的同胞一方面遭受蒋介石政府的压迫，另一方面又面对着日本法西斯的侵略。本人当时也还在苏州监牢里。
    但是芦沟桥的炮火终于冲破了当时沉闷的空气。人民的力量，使南京反动政府不得不与中国共产党联合，发动全面抗战。这一抗战，是中国人民解放运动的开始。这一炮打开了中国人民身上的枷锁，也打开了我们苏州监牢的大门，我因此才得暂时恢复了自由。
    在现在是谁都明白了。没有中国共产党就没有“七七”抗战，中国早就被蒋介石汪精卫送掉了。中国共产党不但在十二年前，首先号召团结抗日，而且抗战开始以后，始终坚持抵抗到底，反对妥协与投降，并且与国民党中的反动派和投降派，作坚决的斗争。这样才能使抗战支持到八年零两个月，得到最后的胜利。
    虽然到了四年前，在名义上抗战是胜利了，但是蒋介石却出卖中国的人民，去了一个日本帝国主义，引进来一个美帝国主义。亏了三年来中国共产党的领导和人民解放军的奋斗，才又把中国人民的三重枷锁完全打开。看今天，城头上几十面红旗的飘扬翻飞，广场前几十万人的欢欣鼓舞，已可证明，中国人民已挣脱了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的三重枷锁，一个崭新的新民主主义的新中国已经涌现。当此情景，我们如何不兴奋快乐。一切固然是依靠我们全体人民的力量，但我们特别要感谢中国共产党和毛泽东主席，要感谢中国人民解放军和朱德总司令。敬礼！
    今天，我们虽然庆祝胜利，但我们的面前的工作仍是艰巨而遥远的。国民党反动派残余势力尚未肃清，一切经济文化教育的建设工作方才开始，我们一定要在中共领导下再接再厉继续奋斗，来完成我们所期望的新中国的建设工作。
    同时在今天我们还应当想到，日寇曾高唱过“大东亚共荣圈”的口号，他们想奴役榨取太平洋上各弱小民族。日本虽然投降，弱小民族并未获得解放。帝国主义现在还想扶植日本军阀，卷土重来，太平洋上一点也没有太平的景象，争取太平洋上的和平，以保卫世界和平，这责任已落在了我们中国人民的肩头了。太平洋上的人民也都在眼巴巴的希望着我们，希望新中国迅速壮大，以确保远东和世界的和平。因此我们一定要负担起保卫太平洋和平的责任。
    参加新政协筹备会各党派各团体为纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年发表宣言，特别指出，要遵照波茨坦协定的原则，来准备对日和约，目的就是为了要重建太平洋的和平，反对美帝国主义以日本作为侵略基地的狠毒计划。我相信这一宣言一定能得到全中国人民的拥护，能得到全世界爱好和平的各国人民的拥护。
    总而言之，肃清国内反动派的残余势力，开始新民主主义的和平建设，进而建立太平洋的和平，这是今天我们大家所应当努力的目标。为了达到这些目标，我愿意高呼着：
    全中国人民团结起来！
    拥护各党派各团体“七七”宣言！
    拥护中国共产党！
    中华人民民主共和国万岁！
    郭沫若
    【平市讯】郭沫若在北平市各界人民纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年大会上的讲演词，全文如下：
    今天来纪念“七七”十二周年，我们首先要向伟大的人民领袖毛主席致敬！向中国共产党致敬！向中国人民解放军致敬！向全国的工农大众致敬！
    有了毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导我们才有了抗战。有了英勇作战的人民解放军，费了八年功夫打败了日本帝国主义，又费了三年功夫打败了美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石，我们才能享到抗战胜利的成果。在这十二年的长期战争中为祖国牺牲了的烈士们是永远不朽的。在这十二年的长期战争中，勤劳英勇，不断增加生产，支援前线的工农大众，今天做了新中国的主人了！
    我们中国人民翻了身，不久便要成立以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主的联合政府了。
    巧合得很！各位同胞们请看，这“七七”两个字，不正表示着工人和农民的双重结合吗？不正是表示着铁锤镰刀、铁锤镰刀的双重结合吗？
    我们纪念“七七”，我们就应该加倍的团结起来，肃清一切国内国外的敌人！打到台湾去，活捉蒋介石！打到广州去，打到重庆去，打到南郑去，活捉一切首恶的战争罪犯！打倒一切帝国主义的侵略阴谋，把一切帝国主义的侵略势力逐出中国去！
    我们纪念“七七”，我们就应该加倍的团结起来，迅速召开新的政治协商会议，迅速成立民主联合政府，迅速按照波茨坦协定，缔结对日和约！实现日本的非军国主义化，实现日本的民主化，反对美帝国主义复兴日本侵略势力的阴谋，反对美帝国主义的一切自私自利专横独断的反动的对日政策！
    我们纪念“七七”，我们就应该加倍的团结起来，拥护中苏友好同盟条约，以中苏两国的密切合作，共同防卫远东的侵略者，参加以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，与全世界人民力量的密切合作，共同反对帝国主义的战争贩子挑拨新世界战争的阴谋！
    我们纪念“七七”，我们就应该加倍的团结起来，发展生产，繁荣经济，恢复交通，发展教育，从事政治、经济、文化、国防的各方面的积极建设，迅速成立一独立、自由、和平、统一的新中国！由新民主主义稳步地上升到社会主义共产主义的更高阶段！
    中国人民解放万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    许德珩
    【平市讯】许德珩在北平市各界人民纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年大会上的讲演词，全文如下：亲爱的同胞们！
    “七七”对日抗战，到今天整整的十二周年！我们现在来纪念这个伟大的日子，尤其是在解放的北平的今天来纪念这个伟大的日子，首先就应当向当年坚持“抗日的民族统一战线”这一正确主张的中国共产党和伟大英明的领袖毛主席致敬！
    大家都晓得，没有人民民主团结的力量，中国当时的反动统治者是不会抗日的。从“九一八”以后，战犯蒋介石，和卖国贼汪精卫一样，都是主张对日投降的。他们当时的不抵抗“主义”，一面抵抗、一面交涉“主义”，亲爱的同胞们，你们现在想还能记得的。他们说“日本三天可以灭亡中国”，他们说中国的武器不如日本，不能打日本。他们还说中国要五十年后才能谈抗日！他们这类胡言乱语，今天在场的同胞们，或许还能记忆！正当日本帝国主义者发动“九一八”的侵华战争时，蒋介石的枪杆子是朝内打的，日寇的铁蹄深入中国国土一步，蒋介石的对内屠杀更疯狂凶猛一步！当时爱国是有罪的，抗日是犯法的，这些事例很多，今天没有时间列举，只就天安门这块地方来说吧！当年常常是武装军警与爱国学生、爱国市民搏斗的场所，和今天这样热烈的、和谐的、旌旗招展、歌声扬溢的情况比较起来，真是使我欢喜得流泪！
    由于中国共产党之“抗日的民族统一战线”之正确的指导，使中国人民团结起来，八年零两个月的民族抗日英勇斗争，遭受着史无先例的牺牲困苦，终于把日本帝国主义打垮了，日寇向我们投降了！
    由于蒋介石在八年抗日战争中，一贯的、未停息的进行屠杀中国人民之反革命的内战，抗日的军事结束以后，他把人民胜利的果实，攫为己有，更双手奉送给美帝国主义者。杜鲁门主义的美国，已经不折不扣的是战前的日本帝国主义，而蒋介石匪帮，则比战时卖国贼汪精卫一伙，还要来得丑恶凶暴。这三年来，美帝不仅仅以大量的军火、金钱、武器、大批的军事作战人员帮助蒋介石屠杀中国人民，并且还积极的扶植日本军阀，扶植日本反动派，企图把日本当作侵略世界，威胁远东和平的军事基地。把日本军阀反动派当作是他们进行侵略的鹰犬，把日本人民当作是军事侵略的炮灰！
    最近，他们更狗急跳墙，不惜单独的停止日本对华赔款。拒绝苏联的建议，邀请中国准备对日和约。并妄图攫取我们的台湾、海南岛，做他们永久的海空军事基地，来威胁世界和平。
    今天纪念“七七”，第一，我们应当知道中国人民曾经以团结的力量，打垮了日本帝国主义。三年以来，由于人民解放军的英勇奋斗，摧毁了南京蒋介石的反动政权，为着实现永久和平，我们相信，今后当更加紧团结，团结在中国共产党的周围，彻底的肃清反动残余，建立人民民主的新中国！
    第二，孙中山先生说过，联合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奋斗，为巩固世界和平，我们更要联合一切爱好和平的国家及其人民，加紧团结，团结在世界和平民主堡垒苏联的周围，粉碎帝国主义者及其走狗蒋介石的战争恶梦！
    第三，为着纪念“七七”，我们今日更要坚决的反对以美帝为首的侵略集团，独占日本，扶植日本法西斯残余，企图发动再一次的侵略战争，我们主张迅速的缔结对日和约，终止麦克阿瑟的对日统治，美帝迅速离开日本！
    同胞们，团结就是力量，目前正在筹备的没有反动派参加的新政治协商会议之召开，它团结了国内各革命阶级，各民主党派，各人民团体，各职业团体，它代表全中国百分之九十以上的人民的利益，团结在中国共产党的周围，足够有力量来解决中国一切的问题。让我们高呼：
    中国人民民主团结万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民英明领袖毛主席万岁！

    八年抗战，终于把日帝赶出中国去，那是一个神圣的民族解放战争，然而我们今天纪念七七的十二周年，感到它更有意义！为什么？因为人民解放战争的伟大胜利，保障了抗日战争伟大胜利的果实。因此我们以热烈的心情庆祝八年抗日战争的伟大胜利，庆祝三年人民解放战争的伟大胜利！但是胜利是由人民大众牺牲换来的，是由于中国共产党的正确领导，由于人民解放军的英勇牺牲，百战百胜。因此我们向中共致敬！向解放军致敬！向人民领袖毛主席致敬！向广大的人民致敬！
    现在反动派在基本上被打垮了，但它们还企图作最后挣扎，与美帝勾结，出卖台湾。因此，我们拥护坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭反动派的残余力量，打到台湾去，活捉蒋介石，活捉一切首要战犯！
    抗日战争的伟大胜利，已经过三年了！然而日本的法西斯残余力量，在美帝扶持之下，有死灰复燃的危险，而且美帝独占日本，企图作为基地，发动新的侵略战争。这种反动行为，对日本、对中国、对世界和平，都具有威胁的性质，因此，我们要求迅速按照波茨坦协定，缔结对日和约，而这个和约，必须有中国民主联合政府全权代表参加，才能有效！
    我们反对美国长期占领日本，要求日本民主化！但美帝的反动行为，我们也不能忽视。因此，我们高呼：一切帝国势力退出中国去！拥护中苏友好同盟，中苏两国共同防御远东侵略者！
    中国现在已是人民的国家，我们要爱护我们伟大的、人民的祖国！我们要建设独立的、自由的、和平的、统一的、富强的新中国。为了迅速实现这一伟大的目的，我们拥护迅速召开新政治协商会议，迅速成立民主联合政府！
    今天的大会，由于敌人的干扰，更显示它的伟大！数十万人在这里开会，庄严，辉煌，在北平，实在是空前的！这也是人民伟大力量的检阅！这个力量保全了古老的北平，也一定可以建设新的民主的中国，无疑的，它将要以极大的速度，建设新的北平！但这必须要依靠共产党的领导，毛主席的领导，工人阶级的创造！因此，我们高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    人民领袖毛主席万岁！朱总司令万岁！
    中华人民民主共和国万岁！
    人民的北平万岁！
    劳动人民万岁！

    今年“七七”是抗日战争的十二周年，在十二年当中，我们不仅战胜了日本帝国主义，而且战胜了美帝国主义支持的国民党反动派，现在新的政治协商会议筹备会已经成立，新的人民民主共和国就要产生，这是由于我们工人阶级的政党——共产党和全中国人民领袖毛主席的英明领导，解放军的英勇战争，全中国各阶层人民的团结奋斗，苏联以及全世界民主力量的同情和援助的胜利结果。
    今后我们华北武装斗争已经结束，开始转入和平建设，我们的主要任务，是生产建设，目前的主要工作是恢复与发展生产，我们一定依照共产党和毛主席所指示给我们的“公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流”四面八方的政策，来恢复和发展生产。在这个工作上，我们全体职工，在我们共产党和毛主席的领导之下，决心起带头作用。我们职工现在的社会的和政治的地位是提高了，任务也繁重了。我们建设新社会的知识，还很不够，毛主席指示我们老老实实的努力学习，来提高我们的政治水平和生产技术。我们工会的组织，现在还不够强大与巩固，因此毛主席指示我们要深入普遍的把工会组织起来，来完成我们的艰巨任务，我们必须完成这一艰巨任务，现在让我们高呼：
    （一）庆祝八年抗战和三年解放战争的伟大胜利！
    （二）向人民解放军致敬！
    （三）庆祝新政治协商会议筹备会的成立！
    （四）拥护迅速召开新政治协商会议！
    （五）拥护迅速成立人民民主联合政府！
    （六）一切帝国主义势力退出中国！
    （七）坚决镇压反动分子的破坏和捣乱！
    （八）各阶层人民团结起来，为恢复与发展生产，繁荣经济，建设新民主主义的新中国而奋斗！
    （九）毛主席万岁！
