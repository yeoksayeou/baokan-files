Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd. The Jiu San Society, a democratic group organized by some democratic figures in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing and other places, sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the 1st, signed by Xu Deheng, the person in charge of the society, to congratulate the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. The telegram is as follows:
    To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:
    As the Chinese people are engaged in the liberation war approaching the national victory, coinciding with the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the members of our society extend our highest respect with unparalleled joy.
    For the past hundred years, the Chinese people have suffered from the repeated oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have finally been liberated from this oppression and exploitation. Today, in addition to expressing our heartfelt congratulations, we must resolutely fight under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great and wise leader Chairman Mao to eliminate the remaining reactionaries and build a new China.
    Jiu San Society, Xu Deheng, July 1st
