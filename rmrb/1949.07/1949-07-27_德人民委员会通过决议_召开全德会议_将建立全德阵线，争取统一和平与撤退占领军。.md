Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th – TASS, Berlin: The German People's Council held its eighth session on the 22nd. After discussing the results of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, it resolved to authorize the Chairman of the Presidium to take new steps to convene an All-German Conference and establish an All-German Front. The resolution pointed out that the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference resolution has unambiguously approved the efforts of the democratic forces in Germany to strive for German unification and has openly exposed the policies aimed at dividing Germany and preparing for war. The German People's Council, therefore, resolved to propose the following four-point plan to promote the All-German movement for German unification, just peace, and the withdrawal of occupation forces: (1) Demand that all major German institutions, political parties, and other groups in West Germany cease all divisive measures, such as holding elections in West Germany and establishing a West German federal government. (2) Reiterate the recommendation to West German associations to convene an All-German Conference and form an All-German Committee to immediately begin drafting German people's recommendations to the occupying powers, in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Paris Conference communiqué. (3) Welcome the German Economic Commission's recommendation to all German economic institutions to hold discussions on economic relations in the various occupied zones, to restore a unified German currency, expand domestic trade, develop peaceful production, and curb the growth of unemployment in West Germany. (4) All responsible German organs, parties, and groups in the four occupation zones of Berlin should convene as soon as possible to discuss the restoration of a unified administration and currency in Berlin. The resolution further urged the Western occupying authorities to change their negative attitude towards early preparation for a peace treaty. The German People's Council finally called on the German people to abandon partisan differences and seize every opportunity to resolve the German question. The People's Council decided to draft a political program for the All-German Front, because only by uniting within the All-German Front can we successfully carry out the struggle for unification, peace, and the withdrawal of occupation forces.
