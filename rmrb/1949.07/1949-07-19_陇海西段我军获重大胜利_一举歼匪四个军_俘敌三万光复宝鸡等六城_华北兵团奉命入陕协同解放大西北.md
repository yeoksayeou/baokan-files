Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 18th: After crushing the counter-offensive by the Hu-Ma bandit troops attempting to retake Xi'an, the People's Liberation Army's First Field Army and the North China People's Liberation Army, ordered to enter Shaanxi for combat, launched a powerful offensive along the western section of the Longhai Railway on the 12th of this month. On the first day of the offensive, they achieved a major victory by annihilating four enemy armies. Advancing rapidly westward along both banks of the Wei River in the scorching heat, the People's Liberation Army, according to the command's plan, encircled and annihilated the 38th, 65th, and 90th armies of the Hu bandits' 5th Corps, commanded by Pei Changhui, and the 119th Army of the enemy's "Longnan Corps," commanded by Wang Ziqi, in the Fufeng and ＠ counties area. Also, in the Mazhao Town area south of ＠＠, they annihilated parts of the 123rd and 165th divisions of the 36th Army (this unit was reorganized from the 135th Division after being annihilated in Jinqu Town, southeast of ＠ county, on June 15th). According to preliminary investigations, the People's Liberation Army has captured over 30,000 enemy soldiers, killed and wounded over 10,000 bandit troops (with several thousand more escaping and drowning in the Wei River), and seized the opportunity to recover four county towns, including Wugong, Fufeng, Qishan, and ＠ county. The People's Liberation Army is currently pursuing and annihilating the remaining bandits while taking advantage of their victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 18th: After achieving a great victory in the Fufeng and ＠ county area, the People's Liberation Army's First Field Army recovered Baoji City, a strategically important military and industrial city in the Northwest, and Fengxiang, an important city in central Shaanxi, on the morning of the 14th. The defending enemy Hu bandit 214th Division blew up the Wei River bridge and fled south in disarray with two regiments. Our army is pursuing them fiercely to the south. Baoji was first liberated on April 26th last year, at which time four regiments of the Hu bandit Reorganized 76th Division were annihilated, and the bandit division commander Xu Bao was killed. Our army seized countless military supplies and withdrew on April 28th. After this recovery, the city will forever belong to the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 18th: The North China Corps of the People's Liberation Army, in mid-June, was ordered to cross the river and enter Shaanxi for combat, coordinating with the People's Liberation Army's First Field Army to jointly liberate the Northwest. After entering Shaanxi, the corps launched this powerful offensive in the western section of the Longhai Railway in coordination with the First Field Army. The people of the Northwest were extremely excited upon hearing the news of the North China Corps entering Shaanxi for combat, and the people in the cities and villages along the way warmly welcomed them. Because the North China Corps is fighting side by side with the First Field Army in Shaanxi, the complete annihilation of the Hu-Ma bandit troops and the complete liberation of the Northwest will be accelerated.

    陇海西段我军获重大胜利
    一举歼匪四个军
    俘敌三万光复宝鸡等六城
    华北兵团奉命入陕协同解放大西北
    【新华社西北前线十八日电】在粉碎了胡马匪军企图重占西安的反扑之后，人民解放军第一野战军和奉命入陕作战的华北人民解放军，已于本月十二日沿陇海路西段发起强大攻势，攻势的第一天，即已获得歼敌四个军的重大胜利，沿渭河两岸冒酷暑向西疾进的人民解放军，按照指挥部预定计划，在扶风、＠县地区将胡匪第五兵团司令裴昌会及敌第十八兵团司令李振所指挥的三十八军、六十五军、九十军及敌“陇南兵团”的一一九军王治歧部包围歼灭。并在＠＠以南马召镇地区，歼敌三十六军一二三师、一六五师（该部系于六月十五日在＠县东南金渠镇被歼后，由一三五师改编）各一部。据初步清查，解放军已俘敌三万余，毙伤匪军万余（另有逃敌数千在渭河淹毙），并乘胜光复武功、扶风、岐山、＠县等四座县城。人民解放军现正乘胜追歼残匪中。
    【新华社西北前线十八日电】人民解放军第一野战军在取得扶风＠县地区大捷后，复于十四日晨收复西北军事重地和工业城市宝鸡城及陕中重要城市凤翔。宝鸡城守敌胡匪二一四师两个团炸毁渭河桥梁后狼狈南逃。我军正向南猛追中。按宝鸡曾于去年四月二十六日首次解放，那时曾歼灭胡匪整编七十六师四个多团，匪师长徐保被击毙，我军缴获军用物资无数，旋于四月二十八日撤离。此次光复后，该城即永远属于人民所有。
    【新华社西安十八日电】人民解放军华北兵团，于上月中旬奉命渡河入陕作战，配合人民解放军第一野战军，共同解放大西北。该兵团进入陕西后，即协同第一野战军发动此次陇海西段的强大攻势。西北人民听到华北兵团入陕作战的消息后，兴奋异常，沿途城乡人民热烈欢迎。由于华北兵团入陕与第一野战军并肩作战，将使胡马匪军的全部被歼和大西北的全部解放加速地到来。（附图片）
