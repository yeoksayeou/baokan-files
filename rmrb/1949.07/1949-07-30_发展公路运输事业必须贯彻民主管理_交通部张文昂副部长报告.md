　　【Report from this newspaper】The North China Highway Transportation Machinery and Vehicle Affairs Conference continued yesterday (the 29th), with a report by Zhang Wen'ang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications of the North China People's Government. Regarding how to restore and develop highway transportation at the present stage, Vice Minister Zhang put forward the following points that must be paid attention to:

　　First, to eliminate the colonial ideology of relying on imperialism, we must develop highway transportation on the basis of independence, self-reliance, and regeneration. In terms of automobiles, it is neither necessary nor possible to buy automobiles and gasoline from imperialists. We can use the existing automobiles and convert them into charcoal vehicles to break the current difficulty of gasoline shortage. In terms of manufacturing parts, we should try to manufacture them ourselves as much as possible. Even if the cost of self-made parts is higher and the quality is inferior, we should still purchase and use self-made parts. Because only in this way can we get rid of imperialism economically and build an independent New Democratic economy.

　　Second, implement democratic management and overcome bureaucratic work style. Today's automobile companies and factories are state-owned. In the New Democratic state-owned enterprises, all employees are the masters, which is essentially different from capitalist enterprises. We must recognize that realizing democratic management is a powerful weapon for developing production. In order to successfully complete the task of highway transportation, we must rely closely on the masses of workers. Therefore, we must break through the obstacles of the following two thoughts: One is to think that we are serving the people, and the plans and things we do represent the interests of the masses, and there is no need to pay attention to the opinions of the masses. The second is to think that the masses of workers do not understand long-term interests, distrust the masses, and regard themselves as higher than the masses. Both of these ideas are extremely harmful and must not be allowed to continue to develop, and should be thoroughly eliminated.

　　Third, the combination of shock competition and regular work. In order to complete special tasks or create certain experiences, shock competition is necessary. However, when this kind of competition reaches a certain stage and gains certain experiences, we should take it as the basis of regular work, and not continue to compete aimlessly, causing the masses of workers to be overworked and affecting regular work.

　　Fourth, promote planning. Whether in transportation work, parts manufacturing, or material use, we must carry out planning and overcome waste. For example, in transportation, we must actively sign contracts with trading companies, enterprise departments, and private capitalists to carry out business in a planned manner. Similarly, in the manufacturing of parts, automobile factories should have unified plans. What to manufacture and who manufactures what must be uniformly stipulated to avoid blind production.

　　Fifth, establish a unified system. We cannot rely on the leadership to formulate a system. The system is to rely on everyone to create experience, summarize experience, and become a system, and then implement it universally. However, this system is not perfect and cannot be changed, but needs to be constantly tested and improved in practice. In the past, we created a lot of experience, but we did not summarize it well, nor did we exchange it well. This phenomenon must be overcome. (Traces)

　　发展公路运输事业必须贯彻民主管理
  　交通部张文昂副部长报告
    【本报讯】华北公路运输机务车务会议，昨（二十九）日继续举行，由华北人民政府交通部张文昂副部长做报告。关于在现阶段如何恢复与发展公路运输事业，张副部长提出以下几点须要注意的问题：
    第一，肃清依赖帝国主义的殖民地思想，必须在独立自主自力更生的基础上，发展公路运输事业。在汽车方面，不必要也不可能买帝国主义的汽车、汽油，我们可以利用已有的汽车，改成木炭车，打破目前汽油缺乏的困难。在制造配件方面，要尽量自己制造，即使目前自制的零件成本较高，质量较逊，我们也应该购买使用自造的。因为，只有这样，我们才能在经济上摆脱帝国主义，建设独立的新民主主义经济。
    第二，贯彻管理民主化，克服官僚主义作风。今天的汽车公司工厂都是国营的，在新民主主义的国营企业里，全体职工都是主人，这是和资本主义的企业具有本质的不同。我们必须认清实现民主管理是发展生产的有力武器，为要顺利完成公路运输的任务，就得紧紧依靠工人群众，因此，我们要打破过去两种思想的阻碍：其一就是以为自己是为人民服务，自己所订的计划和所做的事，就是代表群众利益的，不必注意群众的意见。其二就是认为工人群众不了解长远利益，不相信群众，把自己看得比群众高。这两种思想都是极端有害的，决不能再让其继续发展下去，应该彻底肃清。
    第三，突击竞赛与经常工作的结合。为要完成特殊任务，或创造某种经验，突击竞赛是必要的。但在这种竞赛进行到一定的时候，获得了一定的经验，我们就应该把它当做经常工作的基础，不能毫无目的的竞赛下去，致使工人群众疲劳过度，影响经常工作。
    第四，发扬计划性。无论在运输工作、零件制造和材料使用上，都要有计划的进行，克服浪费。例如在运输方面，我们要主动的和贸易公司、企业部门和私人资本家订立合同，有计划的进行业务。同样的，在制造零件上，各汽车工厂就要有统一的计划，要制造什么，谁制造什么，都得统一规定，避免盲目生产。
    第五，建立统一制度。我们不能依赖领导上订出制度来，制度是要依靠大家在下面创造经验，总结经验，成为制度，再普遍施行下去，但这个制度亦非十全十美不能更动的，而是需要在实行中不断的考验与改进。过去我们创造了不少的经验，但我们没有很好的总结出来，也没有好好的交流。这种现象，是要克服的。（迹）
