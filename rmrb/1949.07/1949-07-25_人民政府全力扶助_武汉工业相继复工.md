Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 24th—Wuhan's industry, devastated and stifled by the Kuomintang White bandits, is gradually recovering with the full support of the People's Government. According to a survey by the Wuhan Industrial Association in March of this year, nearly half of the more than two thousand one hundred private factories and workshops had ceased operations, and the machinery industry had completely stopped in January. Even among sixteen public industrial units, eleven had suspended operations. After the liberation of Wuhan, the Military Control Commission and the People's Bank successively allocated a total of 834.64 million yuan in production funds and industrial loans to support the resumption of work in both public and private factories. The Trade Corporation also supported the production of public Huaxin Cement Company and private Suihua Match Company, Lihua Coal Mine, and the First Cotton Mill by placing orders, with a total payment of over 546.75 million yuan in orders. The Municipal Government Supply Bureau also purchased some of the accumulated finished products from private factories to help some manufacturers circulate funds. At present, 14 public factories have resumed work, including heavy industries such as electricity, steel, coal mines, cement, and machinery, as well as light industries such as weaving, flour, and tobacco. Private industries, due to receiving loans, have resumed work in sectors such as textiles, flour, and cigarettes. Among them, the First Cotton Mill, Shenxin, Yuhua, and other four textile factories originally had 145,000 spindles, and now 110,000 spindles are in operation, producing 120 dan of yarn per day. More than ten flour mills can now produce about 10,000 bags of flour per day. Of the 33 cigarette factories that had completely stopped work before liberation, more than 20 larger factories have resumed work, with a monthly output of 5,000 cases of cigarettes. Other industries such as soap, bricks, tiles, matches, and printing are also gradually recovering.
    Also: The Wuhan workers' movement has gradually unfolded. Under the leadership of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Central China, the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has been established, and the "Central China Worker" newspaper has been published. Workers' representative meetings and study committees have been established or are being established in various factories. The Municipal Workers' Consumer Cooperative has been established and is now helping various factories establish branches.

　　人民政府全力扶助　武汉工业相继复工
    【新华社汉口二十四日电】被国民党白匪所摧残、窒息的武汉工业，经人民政府全力扶助，已渐次复苏。据武汉工业会今年三月调查材料，二千一百余私营工厂、作坊停工几近半数，机器工业则在一月即全部停顿，甚至达十六个公营工业单位中亦有十一个停工。武汉解放后，军管会、人民银行先后共拨发生产资金及工业贷款八亿三千四百六十四万元，扶助公私营各工厂复工。贸易总公司又以订货方式扶助公营华新水泥公司及私营燧华火柴公司、利华煤矿、第一纱厂等生产，计共付出订货款五亿四千六百七十五万余元。市政府供应局并收购了私营工厂的一部积存成品，帮助部分厂商周转资金。目前公营工厂已复工的有电力、钢铁、煤矿、水泥、机器等重工业及织布、面粉、烟草等轻工业共十四个单位。私营工业因得到贷款而复工的有纺织、面粉、卷烟等业。其中第一纱厂、申新、裕华等四家纺织厂，原有锭子十四万五千枚，现已开动十一万枚，每天可出纱一百二十担。十余家面粉厂现每日可出面粉一万包左右。在解放前全部停了工的三十三家卷烟业，已有二十余家较大工厂复工，月产达卷烟五千箱。其他肥皂、砖瓦、火柴、印刷等业也在逐步恢复中。
    又：武汉职工运动已逐渐展开。在华中职工总会筹委会领导之下，武汉市职工总会筹委会已经成立，并出版了“华中工人”报。各厂已先后建立了或正在建立职工代表会及学习委员会。市职工消费合作总社已成立，现正帮助各工厂建立分社。
