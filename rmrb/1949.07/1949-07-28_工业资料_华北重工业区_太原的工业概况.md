　　North China Heavy Industrial Zone
　　An Overview of Taiyuan's Industry
    Dong Ying
    Taiyuan is a heavy industrial zone in North China, the crystallization of decades of intense exploitation and plunder of the people by the Yan Xishan clique.

    A general introduction to Taiyuan's industry is as follows:

    1.  Electricity: Very decentralized, mainly in five locations: Northwest Steel Plant, Outside City Power Plant, Inside City Power Plant, Locomotive Factory, and Lancun Paper Mill. However, due to boiler repairs being neglected and a shortage of materials, the actual power generation is very low. During Yan Xishan's time, management was not unified: the Electricity Department only managed the Inside City Power Plant, while other plants managed themselves. Therefore, there was a lack of unified coordination in power transmission, distribution, and usage, greatly hindering the rationalization of power supply. During the Taiyuan Campaign, many high-voltage and low-voltage lines in the city were damaged. They are currently being actively repaired, and the electricity supply in Taiyuan City can be basically resolved in the future.

    2.  Coal Industry: (A) Xishan Coal Mine, with extractable reserves of approximately 120 million tons, and a workforce of over 1,800 people. The highest daily output in the past was 1,800 tons. After liberation, efforts were made to actively repair transmission lines and use steam pumps for drainage. Coal production officially began on May 2nd, with a daily output of 600-700 tons. (B) Dongshan Coal Mine, with extractable reserves of over 12.12 million tons, and a workforce of over 760 people. The highest daily output before liberation was around 200 tons. Coal production officially began on May 15th after liberation, with a daily output of about 100 tons. (C) Fujiatan Coal Mine, workers began manual mining in January 1949. The coal from this mine is suitable for coking and is mostly supplied to the Northwest Steel Plant. The current daily output is 50 tons. After the installation of machinery, the daily output will increase to over 500 tons.

    3.  Northwest Steel Plant: Coke production averaged 4,597 tons per month in 1948. Iron production averaged 47 tons per day in 1948. There are two types of products: high-grade cast iron and open-hearth steel. Steel production averaged 815 tons of carbon steel per month in 1948. Steel rolling averaged 1,949 tons per month in 1948 (various square steel, round steel, rails, steel plates, angle iron, etc.). In addition, there are facilities for wire nails, nickel production, and a calcium carbide plant. The total number of employees in the plant is 2,238.

    4.  Mechanical Industry: Taiyuan's industry has been looted twice. When Yan Xishan retreated at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, he moved away some of the good machinery. After the Japanese occupied Taiyuan, they moved away all the German machinery that could be moved (it is said that Yan Xishan only had more than 300 machines when he returned to Taiyuan. Later, Yan Xishan ordered all factories to desperately manufacture machines, and even when our army surrounded Taiyuan, he ordered workers to complete 6,000 machines. Because they were forced to be made by workers, most of the machines are not suitable). The factories include the Northwest Manufacturing Plant, Northwest Locomotive Plant, Northwest Yucai Plant, etc. More than 80% of the machine tools are self-made. The products include locomotives, machines, and munitions. The total number of employees is more than 12,000. A portion has now resumed work.

    5.  Kiln Industry: (A) Northwest Cement Plant, with an average daily output of about 190 tons. The total number of employees is 504. It is now operating. (B) Northwest Kiln Plant, products include refractory materials, porcelain, and glass. The total number of employees is 216.

    6.  Textile Industry: (A) The number of textile workers is 318. Some of the looms are now operating. (B) Northwest Woolen Mill has a total of 155 employees and is now operating. (C) Taiyuan Weaving Factory, with 261 employees.

    7.  Northwest Paper Mill: Officially resumed work on April 30th, with a daily output of 150 reams of wrapping paper.

    8.  Northwest Match Factory: The highest output is 4,000 boxes per month. Before liberation, the daily output was 25 boxes. The number of employees is 178.

    In addition, there are flour mills, cigarette factories, printing plants, oxygen plants, electrochemical plants, tanneries, electrical repair and equipment factories, civil construction companies, vegetable gasoline plants, oil extraction plants, breweries, water plants, and other factories.

  　华北重工业区
  　太原的工业概况
    董英
    太原是华北的重工业区，是阎匪几十年来高度榨娶剥削、掠劫人民的结晶。
    今将太原工业概括的介绍如下：
    一、电力：很不集中，主要有五处，计西北炼钢厂、城外发电厂、城内发电厂、机车厂、兰村纸厂。但由于锅炉失修，器材缺乏，实发电量很低。在阎匪时代管理不统一：电业处仅管城内发电厂，其余各厂自管。因此送电、配电、用电缺乏统一调配，对电力供应合理化牵制很大。太原战役中，全市高压、低压线路破坏很多，现正积极修复，将来太原市电力可基本上得到解决。
    二、煤业：（甲）西由煤矿，采掘量为一亿两千万吨左右，职工人员共一千八百余名。过去最高日产量为一千八百吨。解放后积极修复输电线路，同时用汽泵抽水，于五月二日已正式出煤，日产六、七百吨。（乙）东山煤矿，可采掘量为一千二百余万吨，职工人员共七百六十余名，解放前最高日产二百吨左右，解放后五月十五日正式出煤，日产约百吨左右。（丙）富家滩煤矿，自一九四九年一月开始组织工人手工开采。此矿煤质适合炼焦，大都供给西北炼钢厂。目前日产五十吨，按装机器后日产将提高到五百吨以上。
    三、西北炼钢厂，炼焦一九四八年平均月产量四五九七吨。炼铁一九四八年平均日产四七吨。产品有两种：高级铸铁与平炉炼钢铁。炼钢一九四八年平均月产量炭素钢八一五吨。轧钢一九四八年平均月产量一九四九吨（各种方钢、圆钢、铁轨、钢板、三角铁等）。此外尚有洋钉、制镍、电石厂设备，全厂职工人数二二三八名。
    四、机械工业：太原的工业遭过两次洗劫。阎匪在抗日战争开始撤退时将一部份好的机械搬走，日本人占领太原后又将德国机械能搬走的全部搬走（据说阎匪回太原时仅有三百多台机器，后阎匪下令各厂拼命制造机器，直到我军围太原时还命令工人完成六千台机器。因是强迫工人制造的，故机器多不合用）。工厂计有西北制造厂，西北机车厂，西北育才厂等，工作机有百分之八十以上是自造。生产成品有机车、机器及军火等。职工人数共一万二千余人。现一部分已开工。
    五、窑业：（甲）西北洋灰厂，平均日产一九○吨左右。职工人数共五○四名、现已开工。（乙）西北窑厂、产品有耐火器材、磁器、玻璃等。职工人数共二一六名。
    六、纺织工业：（甲）纺织职工人数三一八名。一部分织布机现已开工。（乙）西北毛织厂职工共一五五名，现已开工。（丙）太原织造厂，职工二六一名。
    七、西北制纸厂：四月三十日已正式复工，日产包装纸一五○令。
    八、西北火柴厂：最高产量每月四千箱。解放前日产二五箱。职工一七八名。
    此外尚有面粉厂、纸烟厂、印刷厂、氧气厂、电化厂、制革厂、电气修理及器材厂、土木建设公司、植物汽油厂、榨油厂、酿造厂、自来水厂等工厂。
