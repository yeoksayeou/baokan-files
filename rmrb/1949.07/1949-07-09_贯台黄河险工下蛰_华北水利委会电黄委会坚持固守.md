Guantai Yellow River Hazard Undergoing Submersion
North China Water Conservancy Commission Cables Yellow River Commission to Insist on Holding Firm

[Reported by this newspaper] The Guantai Yellow River hazard in Quhe County, Yubei District, has experienced the submersion of its works due to changes in the upstream river course, with the main current directly impacting the second and third dams. Consequently, both dams were completely submerged by the morning of June 27th. The angle groins of the two dams suffered extensive soil base collapse due to scouring by the main current, and the revetments below the groins also continued to submerge. At the time of the emergency, with drizzling rain, the Quhe section immediately mobilized over a hundred civilian workers for emergency repairs, and the engineering team from the Caogang hazard section also went to reinforce. After a day and night of arduous struggle by cadres, the masses, and the Caogang engineering team in the rain, the dam base had stopped collapsing by the morning of the 28th. However, because the levee at this location had been damaged by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in July 1947, although it was later repaired by us, the newly repaired dam groins were not solid enough, and the location also has a quicksand bottom. Therefore, with the fierce impact of the main current, the situation suddenly became tense again on July 1st. From the 1st to the 3rd, the second and third dams and the revetments below them were repaired and submerged simultaneously, but have not yet emerged from the water, and back-levee failures have occurred. The Guantai hazard is four li north of the Guanmeng levee, and the Beiyue River has an old river channel, which is 1.5 meters lower than the riverside. Although the Guanmeng levee is currently three meters higher than the water surface, it is a new river levee. If Guantai is lost, the Yellow River will surge towards the Guanmeng levee, which would be extremely dangerous. Upon hearing the news, the Yellow River Commission immediately dispatched Zhang Fang, director of the Engineering Department, with technical personnel to rescue the situation. Zhao Mingfu, deputy director of the Yellow River Commission, also rushed from Kaifeng with engineers to provide guidance. The Jiluyu Administrative Office has also ordered the Fourth District Administrative Office to immediately send cadres to lead the effort. Materials are currently being actively prepared and transported to the site. Upon learning of the situation, the North China Water Conservancy Commission specifically telegraphed the Yellow River Commission, insisting on the policy of firmly defending Guantai while strengthening the Guanmeng levee.

　　贯台黄河险工下蛰
  　华北水利委会电黄委会坚持固守
    【本报讯】豫北分区曲河县贯台黄河险工，因上游河势变化，大溜直冲第二、三坝，因此该两坝均于六月二十七日晨全部下蛰入水。两坝的跨角埽，因被大溜掏刷，土基成批坍塌，同时埽以下的护沿，也不断下蛰。出险时正值阴雨蒙蒙，曲河段当即召集民工百余人进行抢修，曹岗险工段工程队亦往增援。经三区干部群众及曹岗工程队冒雨奋战一昼夜，至二十八日晨坝基已停止坍塌。但由于该处堤坝在一九四七年七月曾被蒋匪破坏，后虽经我修复，但新修的坝埽不够巩固，加以该处又系流沙底，故至七月一日，在大溜猛冲下，形势又突呈紧张，自一日到三日，二、三坝及以下护沿，随修随蛰，尚未出水，并发生后溃现象。贯台险工北距贯孟堤四华里，且北月河有旧河沟，低于临河一公尺半，贯孟堤虽高出现在水面三公尺，但系新河堤，如贯台失守，则黄水即将猛扑贯孟堤，极为危险。黄委会闻讯后，立即由工程处长张芳率技术人员前往抢救；黄委会副主任赵明甫亦偕同工程师由开封赶往指导；冀鲁豫行署也命令四专署立即派干部前往领导。现该处正积极筹运料物中。华北水利委员会闻讯后，特电黄委会坚持固守贯台，同时加修贯孟堤的方针。
