　　Datong Bans Silver Dollar Circulation, Commodity Prices Fall Steadily Last Month
    [Datong News] Since the People's Bank of Datong, the Public Security Bureau, and state-owned trading institutions have worked closely together to strictly prohibit the circulation of silver dollars and crack down on black market transactions, commodity prices have shown a steady decline. On May 3rd, the Datong Military Control Commission issued an order to redeem silver dollars and prohibit their circulation. However, due to the public's insufficient understanding of the Renminbi, some people remained hesitant and took advantage of silver dollars to stir up trouble. In the thirteen days from May 2nd, when Datong was liberated, to the 14th, the black market price of silver dollars rose by 140%, and commodity prices also rose accordingly. The price of millet rose by 83%, and Five Blessings foreign cloth rose by 19%. This greatly harmed citizens and legitimate merchants, who demanded strict prohibition. After May 7th, the Datong Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the People's Bank, and the Public Security Bureau held two meetings and decided to implement strict inspections and mandatory redemption. Inspection stations were set up at the railway station and city gates, and special personnel were assigned to patrol the city. In the past two months, a total of 14,786 silver dollars have been redeemed, and 140 cases have been investigated and dealt with. Silver dollar traders and speculative profiteers have been punished with devaluation redemption, confiscation, or referral to the People's Court, allowing the market to break free from the control of silver dollars, and commodity prices have been able to stabilize rapidly by the end of May. Furthermore, due to the gradual opening of material exchanges between urban and rural areas and the abundant supply of grain and goods, the prices of millet and foreign cloth have been falling daily since the beginning of June. By the 23rd of last month, they had fallen by 20% compared to the beginning of the month.

　　大同取缔银元流通  上月物价平稳下落
    【大同讯】大同市人民银行、公安局、及公营贸易机关紧密配合，严禁银元流通，取缔黑市交易以来，物价即呈平稳下落。五月三日大同军管会下令收兑银元，禁止流通。但由于市民对人民币认识不够，部分人犹存观望，利用银元掀风作浪，自五月二日大同解放至十四日十三天中，银元黑市即上涨了百分之一百四十，物价亦随之上涨，小米上涨百分之八十三；五福洋布上涨百分之十九。市民及正当商人受危害很大，要求严禁。五月七日后，大同工商局、人民银行、公安局经过两次开会，决定实行严密检查，强制收兑。车站城门均设检查处，并调专人在城内流动查禁。两月来共兑银元一万四千七百八十六枚，查获案件一百四十起，对银元贩及投机奸商分别给以贬值收兑、没收、或送人民法院处分，使市场摆脱了银元的控制，物价因而能够迅速在五月底平稳。更由于城乡物资交流逐渐打开，粮货来源盛畅，自六月初小米洋布价格即逐日下落。至上月二十三日均较月初降低百分之二十。
