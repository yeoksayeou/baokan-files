　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 25th: In response to the call from the Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party to go to the countryside, Communist Party and government officials at all levels in Hubei Province are actively organizing work teams to carry out rural work. After the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and its directly affiliated units conveyed Comrade Lin Biao's report at the "July 1st" cadre meeting, all cadres engaged in study and discussion. They generally recognized the importance of rural work in the Central China region at present and actively requested to go to the countryside. The Provincial Committee, the Provincial Government, and their affiliated departments are now specifically arranging current work according to the new policy of focusing on rural work. The Hubei Provincial People's Bank has dispatched five work teams to Xiaogan, Huanggang, Mianyang, Daye, and other places to strengthen the work of county banks and to promote the movement to reject the use of silver dollars in rural areas. The Hubei Provincial Trade Company is also drawing cadres to strengthen the work of branch offices in the aforementioned areas to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The Hubei Provincial Xinhua Bookstore is rushing to print various popular readings for distribution to rural areas and is compiling a handbook on mass work in rural areas (policies, documents, reference materials, etc.) for cadres going to the countryside to read. The bookstore is currently in contact with the propaganda departments of local and county committees throughout the province to prepare for the widespread establishment of branches, sub-branches, and sales agencies in various counties and cities. The Preparatory Committee of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles held its third meeting on July 17th, resolving that the current work policy should focus on rural areas, creating some educational and popular picture books, lantern slides, and short Yangko plays that peasants would enjoy. Most of the cadres of the Preparatory Committee will go to the countryside to work. In order to carry out the rural mass movement in a focused manner, the Wuchang County Committee recently transferred more than 20 cadres from the County Committee and the County Government to form a rural work team, led personally by the head of the County Committee, focusing on one district to mobilize peasants and carry out the struggle against local bullies. Huangpi County has organized a work team to reject the use of silver dollars, including more than 70 people from the County People's Bank, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the Trade Company, and the County Middle School, who are currently going to rural areas to carry out propaganda. Schools are currently on summer vacation, and students in various places are enthusiastically responding to General Lin Biao's call for young intellectuals to go to the countryside, regarding going to the countryside to learn practical knowledge as an honor. More than 100 teachers and students from middle schools in Huangpi, Xiaogan, and other places have joined the work team to reject the use of silver dollars under the leadership of the People's Government and are conducting propaganda in rural areas. Teachers and students from Shangzhi Middle School in Hankou have also organized a work team to go to the countryside to widely publicize the various policies of the People's Government and help promote work through various forms.
