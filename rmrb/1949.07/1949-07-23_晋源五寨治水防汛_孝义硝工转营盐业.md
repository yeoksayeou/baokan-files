　　Jinyuan and Wuzhai Control Floods and Drain Water
    Xiaoyi Niter Workers Switch to Salt Production
    ▲ Jinyuan County in the Taiyuan area began flood prevention work early, saving tens of thousands of mu of good farmland from flooding. The county has been working hard on flood prevention since early May, and the bank has allocated grain to help, so that the project can be carried out smoothly. For example, Gucheng Camp opened two drainage canals, so that even the thousands of mu of land that are often flooded can safely grow crops.
    ▲ Wuzhai County completed the water conservancy construction plan to restore and increase 10,000 mu of cultivated land in this year's spring plowing. The four districts have built 26 canals, which can use mountain floods to irrigate more than 8,000 mu of land, and clear water to irrigate more than 1,000 mu of land. It is estimated that it can increase grain production by 1,200 shi. Among them, the second district has achieved the greatest results. The district has built 18 canals, accounting for one-third of the county's water conservancy construction.
    ▲ Xiaoyi's military-use niter boiling industry has shifted to salt production. There were originally more than 220 households in the local niter boiling industry, with more than 260 workers and 62 pots. Now, due to changes in the situation, the demand for niter has been greatly reduced. Now niter industry workers are planning to switch to the salt industry.
    ▲ The industry and commerce of Yucheng Guancheng District have developed rapidly. Before liberation, there were only two private cotton weaving industries with 19 workers and only 403 commercial firms (of which only 210 were shopkeepers, and the rest were small vendors). After liberation in July last year, our People's Bank provided loans to support them. According to statistics at the end of May this year, in just ten months, private cotton weaving factories have developed to 69, with 698 workers, which is nine times that before the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. Commerce has also developed to 1,157 firms, including 571 shopkeepers.

　　晋源五寨治水防汛
    孝义硝工转营盐业
    ▲太原区晋源县及早进行防汛工作，使万亩良田免受水患。该县自五月上旬即全力进行防汛工作，银行并拨粮扶助，使工程得以顺利进行。如古城营开了两条退水渠，即使经常遭水害的千亩地，亦能安全种植庄稼。
    ▲五寨县今年春耕中完成了恢复与增加一万亩耕地的水利建设计划。四个区修成二十六道水渠，可用山洪漫地八千余亩，清水漫地一千余亩。估计可增产粮一千二百石。其中二区成绩最大，该区共修渠十八道，占全县水利建设的三分之一。
    ▲孝义军用熬硝业转为盐业生产。该地原有熬硝业共二百二十余户，工人二百六十余人，有六十二口锅，现因形势变化，硝的需用量大减，现硝业工人正计划转入盐业。
    ▲榆次城关区工商业飞跃发展。该县解放前私营棉织业仅余两家十九个工人，商业仅余四百零三家（其中座商只二百一十家，余皆小摊贩）。去年七月解放后，我人民银行贷款扶植，今年五月底统计，十个月中，仅私营棉织工厂已发展为六十九家，六百九十八个工人，为抗战前之九倍。商业亦发展到一千一百五十七家，其中座商五百七十一家。
