    I. The health departments of all units, whether in peacetime or wartime, have universally and proactively provided free medical treatment to the masses. According to incomplete statistics, the number of outpatient visits over the past twelve years was 9,878,380, the number of return visits was 49,396,650, and 7,053,127 people were cured. Hospitals admitted 41,898 people, and 32,799 were cured. They conducted health organization and publicity work among the masses. In 1944, the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region called on all units in the region and proposed in the Jin-Cha-Ji Daily to "better organize and develop border area health construction." In 1944-1945, the troops assisted governments at all levels in running training classes for traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, midwives, and district and village health personnel. According to incomplete statistics, approximately 220 people were trained. Xinhua clinics and People's Hospitals were established in Fuping, Taihang, and other places, providing treatment to the masses while developing medical and pharmaceutical cooperative enterprises, and assisting the government in establishing health departments (bureaus) and establishing health organizations in various counties. Currently, approximately 1,000 local health cadres are dispatched from the troops.

    II. Within the Jin-Cha-Ji area, due to the Japanese army's mopping-up operations, malaria, dysentery, typhoid fever, relapsing fever, influenza, and other diseases were prevalent in Fuping, Quyang, and other places in 1941, 1943, and 1945. In individual villages, the number of patients reached 80% of the entire village population. In areas where measles was prevalent, 54% of children contracted the disease, and the death rate accounted for 20% of the sick children. At that time, the military region's health department organized medical teams to carry out emergency treatment in the epidemic areas (personnel were also sent to the guerrilla areas and enemy-occupied areas in disguise for treatment). In the autumn of 1943 alone, before and after the large-scale mopping-up operation, 20 epidemic prevention teams were organized, with more than 104 cadres at the doctor level being sent to various places for treatment. 384 villages were treated, with 13,413 people treated and more than 63,403 treatments administered. The treatment rate was 71.6%, which stopped the spread of the disease, stabilized the people's emotions, and expanded the political influence of our army.

    III. North China has now been completely liberated. In the future, in order to strengthen local health construction, it is planned to transfer four hospitals in stages, with more than 400 medical cadres, which can establish 44 health institutes at the special district level. In addition to carrying out epidemic prevention and health work, it is also planned to have beds for 1,320 convalescents, with 2,200 outpatient visits possible daily. If county-level hospitals are established, 110 can be established, accommodating 1,650 convalescents, with 3,300 outpatient visits daily.

    In short, in recent years, the troops have extracted a considerable number of personnel and medicines to assist in the development of local health work. However, due to the great efforts to rescue the wounded at that time, and the many objective difficulties in carrying out mass health work, the care for local health work is still very insufficient. This requires future efforts.

    华北解放军对地方卫生工作的协助
    钱信忠、叶青山
    一、各部队卫生机关，无论平时或战时，均普遍而主动地给群众免费治病，据不完全统计十二年来门诊出诊数为九，八七八，三八○名，复诊次数为四九，三九六，六五○次，治愈七，○五三，一二七名；医院收容四一，八九八名，治愈三二，七九九名。对群众进行了卫生组织与宣传工作，一九四四年晋察冀军区曾号召全区部队，并在晋察冀日报上提出“更好的组织起来，开展边区卫生建设”。在一九四四——一九四五两年中，部队协助各级政权开办了中医、助产人员、区、村卫生人员等训练班，据不完全统计共训练了约二二○人。在阜平、太行等处设立了新华诊疗所、人民医院，一面给群众治疗，一面开展医药合作事业，并协助政府成立卫生科（局），与建立各县卫生组织，现地方卫生干部中约有千名系由部队中派去的。
    二、晋察冀范围内，由于日寇扫荡，在一九四一、一九四三、一九四五各年中，阜平、曲阳等各地曾有疟疾、痢疾、伤寒、回归热、流感等疾病大流行，个别村庄病人竟达全村人口百分之八十，在麻疹流行地区内有百分之五十四的儿童罹病，死亡占病童百分之二十，当时军区卫生部组织了医疗组至病区突击治疗（游击区，敌占区亦派人化装前往治疗），仅一九四三年秋季大扫荡前后，即组织了二十个防疫组，医生以上干部一○四名分往各处治疗，经治村庄三八四处，经治人数一三、四一三名，治疗次数在六三，四○三次以上，治疗率为百分之七十一点六，制止了疾病蔓延，稳定了人民情绪，扩大了我军政治影响。
    三、华北现已完全解放，今后为加强地方卫生建设，准备分期移交四个医院，医务干部四○○名以上，可成立专署级之卫生院四十四个，除进行防疫卫生工作外，并编制有收容一、三二○名休养员的床位，每日可门诊二，二○○人；如设县立医院，可设一一○个，收容一，六五○名休养员，每日门诊三，三○○人。
    总之，几年来部队抽出相当数量人员与药材，协助开展地方卫生工作，但由于当时大力救治伤员，与客观上存在着开展群众卫生工作的许多困难，所以对地方卫生工作照顾仍然是很不够的。这有待于今后的努力。
