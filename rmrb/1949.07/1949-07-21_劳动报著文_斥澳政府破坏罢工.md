　　Condemns Australian Government for Undermining Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th] Moscow dispatch: The *People's Daily* recently published an article commenting on the heroic struggle of Australian miners, stating: The strike was caused by the miners' extremely difficult situation. The newspaper condemned the Australian Labor government's actions to undermine the strike and starve the strikers, such as emergency legislation, freezing trade union funds, arresting trade union leaders, and imposing legal sanctions on twenty-three Australian Communist Party leaders who allegedly aided the striking miners by not returning one thousand pounds in bank withdrawals. *People's Daily* pointed out: The repressive measures against the miners have aroused a wave of indignation and protest among the working people. The miners' strike has received widespread support from Australian workers. At mass rallies, progressive trade union representatives declared their solidarity with the striking workers. The miners continue to wage a tenacious struggle to protect their rights. Referring to the treacherous role of the Australian Trade Union Committee, *People's Daily* pointed out: Although almost all trade unions across the country expressed their support for the strike, the committee opposed the workers. Committee Chairman Clarey and Secretary Monk demanded that the strikers end the strike and submit to the "mercy of the victors"! Right-wing trade union leaders attempted to disrupt the ranks of the working people, but they were shattered by the miners' unbreakable solidarity.

  　斥澳政府破坏罢工
    【新华社北平二十日电】莫斯科讯：劳动报顷撰文评论澳大利亚矿工的英勇斗争称：罢工是由于矿工的处境异常恶劣所造成的。该报斥责澳大利亚工党政府力图破坏罢工和饿毙罢工者的行动，如紧急立法，冻结职工会基金，逮捕职工会领袖、并对那些所谓不归还一千镑银行提款而援助罢工矿工的二十三名澳大利亚共产党领袖实行法律制裁等。劳动报指出：对矿工的镇压措施，已引起劳动人民的愤慨和抗议的浪潮。矿工罢工受到澳大利亚工人广泛的支持。在群众大会上，进步的职工会代表宣称与罢工工人团结在一起。矿工继续不断地进行保障他们权利的顽强斗争。劳动报在论及澳大利亚职工会委员会的叛卖作用时指出：尽管几乎全国所有的职工会都表示支持罢工，而该委员会却反对工人。委员会主席克拉里和书记蒙克，要求罢工者停止罢工并向“胜利者的慈悲”让步！右翼职工会领袖企图打乱劳动人民的队伍，但是，他们却为矿工们的坚不可破的团结力量所粉碎。
