Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 29th: Helsinki - Seven Finnish trade unions (food, diving, textile, timber, transport, footwear, and rubber) and the Journalists' Association recently sent a letter to the executive committee of the Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions, accusing this leading body of the Finnish trade union movement of adopting a reactionary stance in recent months, excluding leftists from leadership positions, and violating the principles and obligations adopted by the Central Federation of Trade Unions' congress. The letter pointed out the extreme deterioration of the material conditions of the Finnish working people. Recently, the prices of several major commodities have risen, with grain, leather goods, shoes, and textiles rising by 100 percent, the Finnish mark has been devalued, and the tax burden has increased. The letter demanded that the executive committee of the Central Federation revise its trade union policy and support workers' efforts to improve working conditions. The executive committee of the Finnish Democratic Women's League also passed a resolution supporting the demands of these trade unions. On July 24th, the Finnish Transport Workers' Union and the Textile Workers' Union sent a letter to the government's Ministry of Social Insurance, demanding increased wages.
