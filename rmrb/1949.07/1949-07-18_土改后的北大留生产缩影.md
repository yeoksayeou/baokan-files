    A Microcosm of Production After Land Reform: Students Remaining in Beida Village
    Zhang Keren
    This year in Beida Village, Lixian County, not a single piece of land is left barren, and no weeds can be seen in the fields, symbolizing the soaring production enthusiasm of the peasants. In the past, old men who liked to talk about production are now nodding in praise: "This year, people are much more eager to farm." This phenomenon is not accidental, but because land reform has brought them boundless production zeal.

    Now when they talk, they can't help but recall their past suffering, because the unreasonable system of the past left such a deep impression on them. Cui Laochang said with a smile that narrowed his eyes to slits: "Now we are liberated! In the past, we labored our whole lives and never lived such a contented life." Cui Baoseng said: "Jiang Shi from Zheng Village, just because he had been a Taoist priest, could set up gambling and sell flour, and his younger brother could openly rob people because of this influence. That year, Cui Xiaofang from Beida Village had just borrowed an ox to plow the land, and it was snatched away before he even got it to the field. Everyone knew who committed the crime, but there was nothing anyone could do! Back then, it was the landlords' world, and there was no way to appeal!" In their past impoverished lives, there was only hunger to remember. In Beida Village, with over three hundred households, more than twenty households stole crops due to hunger, twelve households begged for food, and more than one hundred households worked odd jobs. More than 50 percent of the households in the village had to mix bran and wild herbs in their food year-round. But after land reform, these phenomena no longer exist. More than two hundred landless households have been allocated land, of which more than seventy households have been allocated houses, and even draught animals have been largely resolved, with private and shared ownership accounting for three hundred and fifty households. Last year, at the end of land reform, the village bought back eleven waterwheels, seven cattle, and eighty-odd pieces of farm equipment to distribute to the peasants, all of which laid the foundation for this year's production.

    The preciousness of time this year proves the increase in the intensity of peasant labor. They say, "In the past, on long, sunny days like these, people under the big trees would have drowned the time with spit!" But now, even holding a meeting during the midday break is not easy. Before the break is over, they are already anxious. Women who used to be ashamed of labor have now joined the torrent of production. Husbands lead their wives to cultivate, and mothers encourage their daughters to produce. It can be seen and heard everywhere. Cui Henian's son joined the army, and because his daughter-in-law, Zhang Caimian, participated in labor, the work in the fields that could not be finished in previous years has already been completed. Organizing labor to participate in production has been valued by the masses. Eighteen women's production teams have been established in the village. Of the three hundred and fifty-six working women in the village, three hundred and twenty-seven are participating in field production this year, increasing the village's labor force by a quarter, demonstrating the mass nature of this year's production.

    From the conversations of many peasants, meticulous farming has become a common feature of this year's production. Especially fertilizer production. From the spring of this year, every family started to make a fuss about it. This year, making fertilizer and raising pigs are more prevalent in Beida Village than in any previous year. Along the streets and in the courtyards of every household, pigsties are piled up. The number of households raising pigs accounts for two-thirds of the total number of households in the village. The production committee member said: "Last year, we raised quite a few pigs, but only one hundred and forty. This year, there are already more than two hundred." Gathering manure is even more important. Some people even forget to carry their manure baskets when they go out a long distance, and turn back to get them. Cui Laohe even picks up chicken manure, and Hu Laohu and his uncle collected five cartloads of manure in May alone. In addition to collecting fertilizer, buying bean cakes is also very common. This year, everyone has some savings, and they are even more generous in buying bean cakes. Cui Wenzhu and four other households bought back three thousand five hundred catties of bean cakes at one market. Yu Jinsheng sold one hundred catties of cotton and exchanged it entirely for bean cakes. Therefore, fertilization has greatly improved compared to previous years. According to a survey of ten households in the village, before the war, each mu (unit of area) was fertilized with one and a half carts of manure. Now, each mu is fertilized with thirty catties of bean cakes and two and a half carts of manure. In cultivation, 40% of the households used to plow the land once, 50% plowed the land twice, and only 10% of the households plowed the land three times. Since the beginning of spring this year, 60% have plowed the land three times, 35% have plowed the land twice, and only 5% of the households have plowed the land once. Due to meticulous farming, although it was dry this spring, there was no significant reduction in wheat harvest. Cui Guoyi fertilized his wheat field with four carts of manure per mu, watered it three times, and hoed it three times, yielding one shi (unit of volume) and two dou (smaller unit of volume) per mu. Liu Xilin fertilized each mu with four carts of manure, fifty catties of bean cakes, and watered it five times, yielding one shi and seven dou of wheat per mu, averaging eight dou per mu.

    Land, in this year of ending land reform, peasants have treasured it like a "gold scraper." Yu Dajin's uncle was preparing to take a piece of land and add ninety catties of cotton to exchange for a piece of Yu Dajin's land south of the village. Dajin, who had not paid much attention to the land in the past, now says, "I wouldn't exchange it even if you gave me more." People in the village often argue with each other to the village office over cultivating one more furrow of land, and the village cadres are tense in mediating land disputes. This year's seriousness about land will be a symbol of every inch of production grown. Cui Baoseng hoed the four mu of land allocated to him four times. Even the accumulated grass roots were turned over. They no longer skim over the land like shaving a head as they did in the past, because the land has returned to their own hands, and they have truly become the masters of the land.

    土改后的北大留生产缩影
    张克仁
    蠡县北大留村，今年没有一块荒地，地里看不见野草，这象征着农民生产情绪的高涨。已往好议论生产的老头子现在也点头称赞着：“今年人们种庄稼的心情大多了。”这种现象不是偶然的，而是土改给他们带来了无限的生产热忱。
    现在他们一谈起来，还断不了回忆起过去痛苦的生活，因为过去不合理的制度给他们印象太深了。崔老昌笑得眼睛成了一条线地说：“现在我们解放了！过去我们劳动了一辈子，也没有过着这样得意生活。”崔保僧说：“郑村的蒋世因为坐过道台，就可拢赌卖料面，他的弟弟因为借着这点势力就可以公开的抢劫。那年北大留村崔小方刚借了一头牛犁地，还没有拉到地里就抢走了，明明知道是谁犯了法也没奈何！那时是地主的天下，上诉无门啊！”过去在他们贫困的生活中是一片饥饿的回忆。三百多户的北大留，因饥饿偷庄稼的就有二十多户，讨吃的十二户，打短工的一百多户，村中百分之五十以上的户长年要掺糠拌菜为食。可是经过土地改革，这些现象已不复有了，二百多缺地户分到了土地，其中七十多户分配了房子，就是耕畜也大体上得到解决，独喂和伙喂的占三百五十户。去年在结束土改中，村中又买回十一辆水车，七只牛和八十多件农具分给农民，这些都给今年生产打下了基础。
    今年时间的可贵，它证明着农民劳动强度的增高，他们说：“要是过去，象这样长天大日头，大树荫下的人们都会用吐沫星子把时间淹完了！”可是现在就是趁歇晌召开一次会也不容易，不到起晌，早已经着了急，已往对劳动害臊的妇女，今年都卷入生产的洪流里，丈夫带领妻子耕作，母亲勉励女儿生产，到处可见可闻。崔鹤年的儿子参了军因为儿媳张彩棉参加了劳动，地里往年作不退的活，今年早已料理完毕。组织劳力参加生产已为群众重视，村中成立的妇女生产组十八个。全村三百五十六个劳动妇女，今年有三百二十七人参加了田间生产，增强了村中四分之一的劳动，他表现了今年生产的群众性。
    从许多农民谈话中，精耕细作已成为今年生产中的共同特点。特别是造肥从今年春天家家就吵起来了：为了造肥、养猪今年在北大留村比以往任何一年都盛行。沿着街道直到每户的院内都堆成猪圈，养猪的户数占全村的户数三分之二，生产委员说：要说去年养猪就不少，才养了一百四十只，今年已有二百多只了。拾粪更为重视。甚至有的人走出门大老远，因忘记了背粪筐，又扭身去取，崔老和连鸡粪也拾起来，胡老虎和他舅在五月一个月中拾粪五车。除了集肥，买豆饼也很普遍，今年大家手里有些积蓄，买豆饼更不吝啬，崔文柱等四户在一个集上就买回豆饼三千五百斤，于进声卖了一百斤棉花完全换回豆饼，因此施肥比往年大大改观。据村中十户调查，战前每亩上粪一车半，现在每亩上豆饼三十斤，上粪两车半。在耕作上，过去耕地一遍的占百分之四十，耕地二遍的占百分之五十，只有百分之十的户数耕地三遍。从今年入春以来耕地三遍的占百分之六十，耕地两遍的占百分之三十五，只有百分之五的户数耕地一遍。由于精耕细作，今春虽天旱麦子收获也没有什么减产，崔过义麦地每亩上粪四车浇水三遍，锄了三遍，每亩产量一石二，刘希林每亩上粪四车，豆饼五十斤浇水五遍每亩产麦达一石七斗，平均每亩仍保持了八斗的产量。
    土地，在结束土改的今年，农民已把它珍贵得象一块“刮金板”，于大进的叔叔准备拿一块地，并贴九十斤棉花去换于大进村南的一块地，已往不太重视土地的大进现在都说：“就是给我再多一点也不换”。村中人们常常为了多耕一垄地，也要吵进村公所来，村干部为着调解土地的争持显得紧张起来。今年人们对土地的认真，将是生产长一寸的象征，崔保僧分配的四亩地，就锄了四遍。连多年积存的草根也翻了上来，他们对土地不再象过去剃头一样浮皮过一下，因为土地已经回到自己的手里，自己真正当了土地的主人。
