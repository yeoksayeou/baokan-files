    Grasping Production Characteristics, Focusing on Establishing Cooperatives, and Using Yarn to Exchange for Cloth to Solve Sales Difficulties: Hebei Central Supply and Marketing Cooperative Achieves Experience
    [This Newspaper News] The Hebei Central Supply and Marketing Cooperative has achieved considerable success in supporting rural handicrafts, connecting urban and rural materials, and opening up material exchanges between distant regions. They grasped the production of Zhuanlu cloth, established key cooperatives, exchanged yarn for cloth, and promoted local cloth to Zhangjiakou. They have already purchased 8,000 bolts of Zhuanlu cloth, solving the difficulties in the production and sales of local cloth, and maintaining the livelihoods of weaving handicraftsmen. In Anxin County, they grasped the characteristics of mat production and the grain requirements of mat weavers, established key cooperatives, and supplied members with reeds and grain. They have already purchased more than 4,000 mats. The Anxin County Cooperative also grasped the special product of crude alkali, developed business, purchased 3.04 million catties of crude alkali, and exchanged it for more than 600,000 catties of grain in Tianjin, solving the problem of crude alkali not being sold and the livelihoods of alkali producers. Shen County, Raoyang, Wuji, Huanghua, and other counties have also grasped the characteristics of local production of pockets and local cloth, established key cooperatives, and developed business. At the same time, the Hebei Central Cooperative, in conjunction with state-owned stores, supplied large quantities of materials such as coal, salt, foreign cloth, and matches to various county cooperatives and key cooperatives, adopting the policy of low-price supply and high-price purchase for members. For example, the Qingyuan County key cooperative supplied members with goods, selling one catty of salt for ten yuan (market price of ten yuan for twelve taels of salt), and a pack of matches for twenty-eight yuan (market price of thirty yuan a pack). The Anxin County Cooperative purchased mats from members at 250 yuan per mat, while the market price was only about 230 yuan per mat. As a result, the masses have gradually gained a understanding of cooperatives.
    As of the end of June, forty key cooperatives have been established in thirty-two counties in Hebei Central, organizing 4,197 members. These facts have shattered the misconception that it is difficult to develop without profit distribution. (Zhong)

    抓住生产特点重点建社以纱换布解决销路困难
    冀中供销合作总社取得经验
    【本报讯】冀中供销合作总社在扶植农村手工业与沟通城乡物资，打开远地区间的物资交换上，获不少成绩。他们曾抓住砖路布的生产，建立重点社，以纱换布，并向张家口推销土布，已收购砖路布八千匹，解决了土布的生产与销路的困难，维持了织布手工业者的生活。在安新县抓住了产席的特点与席民的粮食要求，建立重点社，供给社员苇子和粮食，已收购席子四千多片。安新县社又抓住了皮硝的特产，开展业务，收购皮硝三○四万斤，到天津换回粮食六十多万斤，解决了皮硝卖不出和硝民的生活问题。深县、饶阳、无极、黄骅等县也都抓住了当地出产口袋、土布的特点，建立重点社，开展业务。同时，冀中总社又与国营商店相结合，供给各县社与重点社煤、盐、洋布、火柴等大批物资，对社员采取低价供给，高价收买之方针，如清苑县重点社供给社员物品，一斤盐卖十元（市价十元买十二两盐），火柴一包卖二十八元（市价一包三十元），安新县收购社员席子，以每片二百五十元收购，市价每片只二百三十余元。因之群众对合作社已逐渐有了认识。
    迄六月底止，冀中三十二个县建立了四十个重点社，组织社员四一九七人。这些事实，打破了不分红不好开展的错误认识。  （仲）
