The North China People's Government Ministry of Agriculture Directs All Regions to Launch Rainy Season Afforestation Campaign

[Ping City News] The Ministry of Agriculture of the North China People's Government recently issued instructions regarding afforestation during the rainy season. The instructions began by stating: During the summer and "fu" periods in North China, rainfall is concentrated. The precipitation in July and August accounts for approximately 60% to 70% of the total annual rainfall, and rainy days account for more than 30% of the total annual rainy days. Air humidity reaches above 65%. Therefore, in high, dry sandy areas and mountainous regions, the survival rate of certain tree species planted during the rainy season is even better than in spring and autumn. To develop afforestation work with more time and more methods, all regions must urgently regard the rainy season as one of the important seasons for afforestation.

The instructions continued: This year's rainy season afforestation should be carried out as universally as possible in areas with established habits such as Chahar South, Hebei Central, and Hebei East. It is necessary to formulate rainy season afforestation plans, propose tasks, assign dedicated personnel to be responsible, and seize the gaps in agricultural work to complete the tasks in a concentrated manner. Other regions without established habits must also attach importance to this work, and this year, first focus on key demonstrations to lay the foundation for the development of rainy season afforestation next year.

Regarding the timing of rainy season afforestation, the instructions pointed out that attention should be paid to mastering it. Generally, from the beginning of the first "fu" to the second "fu" period, after a thorough rain, planting or sowing is best done in the first few days of the rainy season. Therefore, preparations must be made in advance for seedlings, seeds, afforestation land, and the organization of labor. If it is collective afforestation, then the land, seedlings, labor shares, and profit distribution methods must be stipulated.

Regarding the technology of rainy season afforestation, the instructions pointed out that it must be well studied and mastered. The types of trees for rainy season afforestation should be willow and reed on river beaches and embankments, mulberry, poplar, and willow in sandy areas, and red Chinese tamarisk, basket willow, amorpha fruticosa, poplar, and willow for layering and cutting in alkaline land. In mountainous areas, small seedlings of pine, cypress, and fir (spruce) and jujube trees should be planted, as well as small seeds of ailanthus altissima, vitex negundo, maple (acer ginnala), and lespedeza bicolor (humzi, hangtiao). Layering should be done with the best one- or two-year-old thin branches, which should be cut and planted without too much delay. Planting cuttings should also use one- or two-year-old small seedlings and smaller branches. Planting large seedlings and inserting thick poplar and willow poles on both sides of the road is extremely difficult to survive and should not be generally promoted to avoid failure.

Finally, the instructions emphasized forest protection work, stating: The results of afforestation this spring were good, with more than 27.75 million trees planted, completing 88% of the annual plan in one season. To consolidate the results, discover problems, and improve work, the survival and growth of spring afforestation and the implementation of forest protection should be inspected at the same time during rainy season afforestation. Regarding forest protection methods, the North China People's Government is currently studying unified forest protection regulations. Before promulgation, the forest protection and tree planting reward methods promulgated by the administrative offices will remain in effect and be strictly implemented.

　　华北人民政府农业部指示各地
  　开展雨季造林运动
    【平市讯】华北人民政府农业部顷发出关于雨季造林的指示。指示首称：华北夏伏期间雨量集中，七、八两月的降水量，约占全年降水量百分之六十至七十，雨日约占全年雨日的百分之三十以上，空气湿度达百分之六十五以上，故在高燥沙地及山地，某些树种，雨季造林成活率较之春季秋季还好。为了以更多时间和更多的方法，发展造林工作，各地亟须把雨季作为造林的重要季节之一。
    指示继称：今年的雨季造林，在察南、冀中、冀东等有习惯地区应尽力普遍进行，要切实拟定雨季造林计划，提出任务，专人负责，抓紧农时空隙，突击完成任务。其他无习惯地区，也须重视这一工作，今年先做好重点示范，以打下明年发展雨季造林的基础。
    关于雨季造林的时机，指示指出应注意掌握。一般自头伏起到二伏期间，在落过一场透雨后，连雨期的前几天，栽植或播种最好。因此事先必须做好树苗、树种、造林地，以及组织劳动力等准备工作，如集体造林，则须规定好土地、苗木、劳力入股以及收益分配办法。
    关于雨季造林的技术，指示指出必须很好的研究掌握。雨季造林的种类，在河滩、堤岸，宜用杨、柳、苇、荻，在沙地宜用桑、杨、柳，在碱地宜用红荆、箥箕柳、紫穗槐、杨、柳等压条插枝造林，在山地宜于栽植松、柏、杆（云杉）、枣等小苗以及播种臭椿、荆条、枫树（色木）、胡枝子（哼子、杭条）等小粒种子。压条造林，以一、二年生的细枝条最好，随砍随栽不要放置时间太久，栽植插枝也须一、二年的小苗和较小枝杆，在公路两侧栽植大苗及插杨柳粗杆，极难成活，不能一般的提倡，以免失败。
    最后，指示强调护林工作称：今春造林成绩较好，植树二千七百七十五万余株，一季即完成全年计划的百分之八十八。为了巩固成绩，发现问题，改进工作，雨季造林中，要同时检查春季造林成活生长情况及护林执行情况。关于护林办法，华北人民政府现正研究统一的护林法规，在颁布之前，各行署所颁布之护林植树奖励办法，仍得生效，并严格贯彻执行。
