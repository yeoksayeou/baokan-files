Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 4th: New York dispatch: Under the auspices of the New York branch of the Human Rights Guarantee Conference, the Human Rights Guarantee Conference opened in New York on June 25th. More than 1,100 representatives participated, and the representatives who spoke at the meeting condemned the rampant U.S. fascist forces and called for unity to resist the attack on the democratic rights of the American people. The meeting passed a resolution to send a letter to Truman, declaring that the American people's inherent freedoms are being violated today by the "trial" of the U.S. Communist leaders. The resolution pointed out: "Guaranteeing the rights of Communists is to protect the Bill of Rights, and therefore to protect the democratic rights of all American people of different races, origins, beliefs, and political affiliations." Former Undersecretary of Justice Rogge, in his speech, protested the anti-democratic measures of "trying" U.S. Communist leaders, and called on progressive people to unite in the struggle against reactionaries. Writer Fast, in his speech, emphasized the damage of the U.S. reactionary persecution movement to American cultural undertakings. He said: "Except for left-wing newspapers, no newspaper publishes accurate news about the economic crisis."

　　美举行保障人权大会
  　反对“审讯”美共领袖
    【新华社北平四日电】纽约讯：在人权保障大会纽约分会主持之下，保障人权大会六月二十五日在纽约开幕。参加的代表有一千一百余人，在会上发表演说的代表，纷纷谴责美国法西斯势力的猖獗，并呼吁团结一致，抵抗对美国人民民主权利的进攻。会议通过致函杜鲁门的决议，宣称：美国人民有生以来的自由权利，今天正因“审讯”美共领袖而受到侵犯。决议指出：“保障共产党人的权利，就是保护人权法案，因而也是保护一切种族不同、血统不同、信仰不同、政治派别不同的美国人民的民主权利。”前司法部次长罗奇在演说中，抗议“审讯”美共领袖的反民主措施，并呼吁进步人士在对反动派的斗争中团结起来。作家法斯特演说时，强调指出美国反动的迫害运动对美国文化事业的损害，他说：“除了左翼报纸以外，没有一份报纸登载经济危机的确实消息。”
