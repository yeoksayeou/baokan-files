New Urban-Rural Relationship
Northeast Daily Editorial, July 5th
(Continued)

We say that the city is extremely important. Where is this importance manifested? Fundamentally, it is manifested in the fact that the city has industry and a working class. Restoring and building industry, and developing the workers' movement, are the basic content of urban work and our top priority. All other work in the city, whether it be political power construction, cultural education, or finance, trade, and cooperative work closely related to industrial construction, must revolve around the central task of developing industry. Rural work must also adapt to the new urban-rural relationship, striving to strengthen itself so that, under the leadership and assistance of the city, it can improve agricultural production, improve the lives of farmers, and in turn help the restoration and construction of industry.

Industry is a modern economy. Only when industry is developed can the national economy be improved, the people's living standards raised, and China move from backwardness to progress, from poverty and weakness to prosperity and strength. Chairman Mao said: "Without industry, there is no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." "Eliminating imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the rule of the Kuomintang (which is the concentrated expression of these three) from Chinese territory has not completely solved the problem of China's independence and autonomy. Only when we achieve extensive economic development and transform from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, becoming economically completely independent of foreign countries, will we finally solve this problem." The restoration and development of industry in the Northeast is of particular significance because the proportion of industry in the Northeast is higher than in other liberated areas in the country. This is an extremely advantageous condition. We must give full play to this advantageous condition and gradually transform the semi-agricultural Northeast into an industrialized Northeast, so that the Northeast can truly become a solid foundation for an industrialized New China.

The working class is the leading force of the Chinese revolution. It has suffered oppression from several enemies and has undergone unparalleled training in the long struggle of the Chinese revolution, showing itself to be particularly resolute and thorough compared to any other class. It is also combined with the most advanced productive forces and is the main force in industrial construction. To carry out arduous economic construction, we must rely closely on the working class and give full play to the power of the working class. The experience of restoration and construction work in various places has fully proven that wherever the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers are promoted, various difficulties can be overcome, and production plans can be completed or exceeded; conversely, they stagnate in the face of difficulties, causing plans to fail or be discounted. The unity of the Chinese working class and its vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party—standing at the forefront of all struggles, fully demonstrates its revolutionary ability and self-sacrificing spirit of struggle. This is to integrate the ideas of Marxism-Leninism with active revolutionary action, and thus it can also unite the other working people, peasants, and other revolutionary classes in the city well, and become their leader, carrying the revolution through to the end to win the final victory of the revolution.

The fundamental change in the nature of cities, especially cities with an industrial base, from being ruled by imperialism and Chinese reactionaries to belonging to the people, has brought about a fundamental change in the urban-rural relationship. In the past, during the period of Japanese occupation, the vast human and material resources in the rural areas of the Northeast were cruelly plundered and used to build colonial industries of Japanese imperialism, causing serious bankruptcy of the rural economy and making the vast number of farmers live an extremely miserable and sorrowful life. This established the urban-rural relationship on a basis of mutual opposition. During the period when the Kuomintang invaded the Northeast, in its occupied areas, the urban-rural relationship was exactly the same as during the period of Japanese occupation, with the city exploiting the countryside, and the urban and rural areas in a state of opposition. Under reactionary political rule, there can be no harmonious and mutually beneficial relationship between urban and rural areas, only a mutually opposing relationship. In a new democratic society, however, with political power in the hands of the revolutionary people led by the proletariat, the political conditions have fundamentally changed, and thus the urban-rural relationship has also fundamentally changed, breaking the past state of opposition and embarking on a path of harmony and mutual assistance, with the city leading and assisting the countryside, using industry to assist agriculture, so that agricultural productivity can continue to develop, and the lives of farmers can continue to improve.

The city leading the countryside means industry leading agriculture, which also means the working class leading the peasant class. The conditions for agricultural production in the Northeast are still quite backward, almost the same as in ancient times. Wooden plows plus cattle and horses, with fertilization of no more than one-third of the cultivated land. The abundance of grain production is mainly due not to high land yields, but to the large amount of land. This backward state of agricultural production must be transformed, and the decisive key to this transformation lies in enabling farmers to obtain new technologies, obtain machinery from the city, and obtain technical guidance. To achieve this requirement, there must be industrial development. With industrial development, a large number of industrial products can meet the needs of farmers for living and production materials, provide farmers with new tools, improve agricultural production technology, transform their production methods, and realize agricultural modernization, and then farmers can be finally liberated from poverty and backwardness. However, on the basis of the individual small-scale peasant economy, there is no possibility of using a large number of new technologies, which also requires agricultural production to gradually embark on the path of collectivization in coordination with industrial development. It must be emphasized that in the rural areas of the Northeast, for a considerable period of time, our task is to continue to organize labor mutual aid under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and not to immediately establish collective farms; if this point is not clarified, serious mistakes will be made. After rural productivity is improved, surplus labor can enter the city, enter factories, and become a vital force in developing industry. When agriculture is developed, the industrial market is also expanded, and industry can be supplied with abundant grain and raw materials, and a large number of industrial products can be absorbed. The countryside turns around to help the city, agriculture helps industry, and farmers help workers. This is the other side of the new urban-rural relationship. Combining these two aspects constitutes a picture of urban-rural mutual assistance. Some comrades do not understand this urban-rural relationship. When they hear that the focus of the Party's work is on the city, they have a wrong idea, thinking that the Party values the city and does not value the countryside, and that the Party wants to concentrate its efforts on industrial production and looks down on agricultural production. As a result, they relax their rural work and the leadership of agricultural production. This erroneous thinking is very dangerous and must be corrected. Chairman Mao clearly told us: "The focus of the Party's work has shifted from the countryside to the city... Urban and rural areas must be taken into consideration, and urban and rural work, workers and peasants, and industry and agriculture must be closely linked together. We must never abandon the countryside and only care about the city. It would be completely wrong to think that way." If the idea in the Party that mistakenly believes that the countryside is no longer important is not corrected and allowed to continue to develop, it will lead us to detach from the countryside and lose the rural position, and thus industrial would not be able to get help from agriculture. We must tell comrades who have this wrong idea that it is precisely in order to implement the transformation of the entire Party from the countryside to the city, and in order to do a good job in urban work and the restoration and construction of industry, that the tasks of rural work and agricultural production are even more important, and that the strength of the countryside and agricultural production must be used to help the faster restoration and development of industry. The large-scale development of agriculture can only be realized on the premise of the large-scale development of industry, and in order to develop industry, agricultural production must also be appropriately improved at the same time. Any one-sided and simplistic view is wrong and harmful.

What is the link between realizing urban leadership of the countryside and developing the mutual assistance relationship between urban and rural areas? This link is the supply and marketing cooperative. The state economy supplies the countryside with industrial products through cooperatives, and the countryside supplies the state economy with agricultural products through cooperatives. With supply and marketing cooperatives, cities and villages, industry and agriculture can be linked together, and scattered individual small producers and farmers can be united around the working class to form a solid alliance. In order to establish this link between urban and rural areas, Party committees, governments, and mass organizations at all levels must put the work of establishing supply and marketing cooperatives on the agenda, and regularly study and discuss this work in order to establish supply and marketing cooperatives conscientiously and systematically in a step-by-step and planned manner.

The new changes in the urban-rural relationship have brought us new tasks. The entire Party must focus on economic construction and do a good job in various tasks. Industry must produce more high-quality and low-priced finished products to supply the countryside, and the countryside must improve agricultural production to ensure food and raw materials for industry. Other various tasks must also mobilize and organize forces to ensure the better realization of the economic construction plan. To this end, we must always maintain a fresh sense, pay attention to and study the changes in various aspects caused by the new urban-rural relationship in a timely manner, so that we can truly implement this historic transformation from the countryside to the city in action.

    新的城乡关系
    东北日报七月五日社论
    （续完）
    我们说城市极为重要，这种重要性表现在哪里？这根本上是表现在城市有工业、有工人阶级上面。恢复与建设工业，开展工人运动，是城市工作的基本内容，是我们的头等重要任务。城市的其他一切工作，无论政权建设、文化教育以及与工业建设密切联系的财政、贸易、合作社工作等等，都要围绕着发展工业这个中心任务来进行。农村工作也必须适应新的城乡关系，力求加强，使农村在城市领导与帮助之下，提高农业生产，改善农民生活，转而帮助工业的恢复和建设。
    工业是现代化的经济，工业得到发展，才能提高国民经济，提高人民生活水平，使中国由落后走向进步，由贫弱走向富强。毛主席说过：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，没有人民的福利，没有国家的富强。”“从中国境内肃清了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义和国民党的统治（这是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三者的集中表现），还没有完全解决中国独立自主的问题，只有待经济上获得了广大的发展，由落后的农业国变成了先进的工业国，经济上完全不依赖外国了，经济上完全独立了，才算最后解决了这个问题。”东北工业的恢复与发展，其意义特别重大，因为东北工业比重高于国内其他各解放区，这是极为有利的条件，我们必须发挥这种有利条件的作用，有步骤地把半农业化的东北逐渐变为工业化的东北，使东北真正能成为工业化新中国的巩固基础。
    工人阶级是中国革命的领导力量，它身受几种敌人的压迫，在中国革命的长期斗争中经过了无比的锻炼，比任何别的阶级表现得特别坚决和特别彻底。它又与最先进的生产力相结合，是工业建设的主力军。我们要进行艰苦的经济建设，必须紧紧地依靠工人阶级，充分发挥工人阶级的力量。各地恢复和建设工作的经验充分证明：凡是发扬了工人的积极性和创造性的地方，就能克服各种困难，完成或超过生产计划；反之，就在困难面前停滞不前，使计划落空或打了折扣。中国工人阶级及其先锋队——中国共产党的团结一致，站在各种斗争的最前列，充分表现出自己革命的能力和自我牺牲的奋斗精神，这就是把马列主义的思想与积极的革命行动结成一体，因而也就能很好地团结城市其他劳动人民、农民及其他革命阶层，并成为他们的领导者，把革命进行到底，以争取革命的最后胜利。
    城市，特别是有工业基础的城市，已经由帝国主义和中国反动派所统治变为属于人民所有这一根本性质的变化，使城乡关系也随之起了根本变化。过去，在日寇占领时期，东北乡村中的广大人力物力，遭到残酷的掠夺，而被用在建设日本帝国主义的殖民地工业上，造成农村经济的严重破产，广大农民过着极其悲惨愁苦的生活。这就使城乡关系建立在互相对立的基础上。国民党侵入东北时期，在其占领区内，城乡关系与日寇占领时期完全一样，也是城市剥削乡村，城乡处于对立状态。在反动的政治统治下，城乡不会有和谐互助的关系，只能有彼此对立的关系。而在新民主主义社会中，政权掌握在无产阶级领导的革命人民手里，政治条件根本改变了，因而城乡关系也根本改变了，打破了过去的对立状态，走上和谐互助的道路，城市领导乡村，扶助乡村，以工业来扶助农业，使农业生产力不断发展，农民生活也就得以不断改善。
    城市领导乡村，就是工业领导农业，也就是工人阶级领导农民阶级。东北农业生产条件仍是颇为落后，和古代差不多，木犁加牛马，耕地施肥面积不超过三分之一，粮产的丰富主要地并不是由于土地产量高，而是由于土地数量大。这种农业生产的落后状况必须改造，改造的决定关键，在于使农民获得新技术，由城市得到机器，得到技术指导。要达到这种要求，必须有工业的发展，工业发展了，才能以大量的工业品，满足农民的生活资料和生产资料的需要，供给农民以新式工具，提高农业的生产技术，改造其生产方式，实现农业近代化，然后农民才能从贫困落后中得到最后解放。但是，在个体的小农经济基础上，没有大量使用新技术的可能，这又要求农业生产配合工业的发展逐步走上集体化的道路。必须着重指出：在东北乡村中，相当长时期以内，我们的任务是继续在自愿两利原则下组织劳动互助，而不是立即建立集体农场；如果不弄清此点，将要犯严重的错误。乡村生产力提高之后，就能有多余的劳动力进入城市，进入工厂，成为发展工业的劳动生力军。农业发展了，也就扩大了工业市场，能以丰富的粮食、原料供给工业，并吸收大量的工业品。乡村转过来帮助城市，农业帮助工业，农民帮助工人，这就是新的城乡关系的另一面。把这两方面综合在一起，就构成了一幅城乡互助的图画。有的同志不了解这种城乡关系，当听到党的工作重心放在城市之后，竟发生了一种错误的想法，以为党看重城市，即是不看重乡村了，党要集中力量进行工业生产，即是看轻农业生产了，于是放松了乡村工作，放松了农业生产的领导。这种错误思想是十分危险的，必须予以切实纠正。毛主席明确地告诉了我们：“党的工作重心由乡村移到了城市。……城乡必须兼顾，必须使城市工作和乡村工作、使工人和农民、使工业和农业紧紧地联系起来，决不可以丢掉乡村，仅顾城市，如果这样想，那是完全错误的。”党内那种误认乡村不再重要了的思想，如不改正，而让其继续发展下去，就会使我们脱离农村，进而失掉乡村的阵地，因而也就会使工业得不到农业的帮助，我们要告诉有这种错误思想的同志：正是为了贯彻全党由乡村到城市的转变，为了要作好城市工作，做好工业恢复与建设，也就更加重了农村工作与农业生产的任务，要用乡村和农业生产的力量，帮助工业的更快恢复和发展。农业大量发展必须在工业大量发展的前提下才能实现，而为了发展工业又必须同时适当地提高农业生产，任何片面的单纯的看法都是错误的和有害的。
    实现城市领导乡村，发展城乡的互助关系，其中间的纽带是什么？这个纽带就是供销合作社。国家经济通过合作社以工业品供给乡村，乡村通过合作社以农产品供给国家经济。有了供销合作社，就可以把城市和乡村、工业和农业联系起来，就可以使散漫的个体的小生产者农民，团结在工人阶级周围，结成一个坚固的联盟。为了建立这种城乡联系的纽带，各级党委、政府、群众团体，必须把建立供销合作社的工作放在议事日程上，经常研究讨论这项工作，以求有步骤有计划地把供销合作社认真地有系统地建立起来。
    城乡关系的新变化，带给了我们新任务，全党要以经济建设为中心把各种工作做好，工业要多生产物美价廉的成品供给乡村，乡村要提高农业生产保证工业的食粮原料，其他各种工作也都要动员组织力量，保证经济建设计划的更好实现。为此，我们必须时刻保持新鲜感觉，对于新的城乡关系所引起各方面情况的变化，及时给以注意，加以研究，使我们真正在行动上贯彻由乡村到城市这一历史性的转变。
