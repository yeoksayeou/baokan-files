　　The willows are sprouting! The sun feels warm on your body. Little Zhong'er ran to the bottom of the tree, and just a few steps made him sweat profusely. He took off his little cotton coat and threw it under the tree. He wiped his face with his hand, and the dirt on his hand stuck to the sweat, instantly drawing black streaks on his face. Seeing his ghostly appearance, Yin Suo, Hei Ni, and Lin Xiao clapped and laughed, which made Little Zhong'er so angry that he picked up a clod of earth and threw it. Unfortunately, the village chief walked by, and it hit him squarely on the foot. The village chief stopped and yelled at him: "Little Zhong'er! Are you being naughty again!" Little Zhong'er was already in a bad mood and wanted to retort fiercely, but suddenly he saw a small female comrade next to the village chief, with a round face and a pair of round, bright, black eyes, smiling at them. Zhong'er was stunned. The village chief continued to walk forward, and turned his head to say to him: "This is your new teacher, go to school tomorrow!"
　　Mentioning school hit Little Zhong'er's sore spot. He is eleven years old this year. His father has been in the People's Liberation Army for more than three years. At home, there is also his mother and an old grandfather. Because his father is not at home, his mother feels especially sorry for him, and his grandfather feels especially sorry for him because he only has this one little grandson. His mother wants to beat Zhong'er because he is always being mischievous and causing trouble outside, but his grandfather protects him; his grandfather wants to beat Zhong'er because he doesn't do his share of the work, but his mother protects him. Little Zhong'er knows this trick, and he is not afraid of anything at home, and he is still not afraid of anything outside. He spends all day leading the children to play, whether it's stealing bird eggs, riding Big Flower Dog to fight battles, or building blockhouses and burying landmines... all kinds of tricks, one new thing every day. The other children are often bullied by him, but they also like to play with him because he has many tricks. As soon as Little Zhong'er arrives, he pats his chest and shouts: "Come on!" Hei Ni, Yin Suo, Lin Xiao, and a large group of children run over from all directions to play with him. The school teachers hate him the most, because he is naughty and always leads the children to make a mess of the classroom. Last year, not long after Little Zhong'er started school, one day, Teacher Wang was writing new words on the blackboard. Little Zhong'er was already tired of learning, so he secretly released the baskets of grasshoppers he had caught these days, and they flew all over the classroom. Yin Suo jumped up to catch them, Hei Ni jumped up to chase them, and the little children were so scared that they yelled for the teacher. Teacher Wang turned around, his eyes wide as copper bells, and without asking anything, he grabbed Little Zhong'er, without any education, just a fierce scolding. From that time on, Little Zhong'er especially hated school and was dissatisfied with the teacher. He was determined not to go to school anymore! Now that a new teacher has come, Little Zhong'er's sore spot has relapsed. But this little teacher is really strange. After school, she helps this family tidy up their spinning wheel, helps that family push the millstone, writes letters, and gets to know a whole bunch of aunts and grannies. Little Zhong'er's heart is even more tightly clenched. He is just afraid that the little teacher will come to his house. That day, after eating lunch, the village chief came. Little Zhong'er bit his lower lip and squatted under the window to eavesdrop. The village chief said: "School starts tomorrow, call Little Zhongzi to get up early and go to school!" Grandpa agreed, and turned to his mother and said: "Zhong'er's mother, call Little Zhong to get up and go to school tomorrow!"
　　When Little Zhong'er heard Grandpa say go to school, he felt a little flustered. But, there was no way, he was woken up by his mother early the next morning and sent to school.
　　For the first two days after Little Zhong'er went to school, he buried his head in learning to write. After two more days, the words "Chinese" in crooked handwriting were written everywhere on the door panels, walls, and water tanks at home. After two more days, the words "Little Zhong'er" in slanting handwriting were written next to each "Chinese." After two more days, a large number of human heads, puppies, and big donkeys were drawn next to the words. Little Zhong'er was bored with school. After eating breakfast, he saw the village chief and others going to dig a large canal in the east of the village. There were so many people! Little Zhong'er ran to watch the bonfire, going back and forth, and soon the sun was right overhead. He was busy walking back home when suddenly he saw a big black cat on the big elm tree, staring at him with round eyes and meowing at him. He hurriedly climbed up the tree to catch it, but the big black cat was even more clever, and jumped down the tree lightly and ran away. Little Zhong'er was also busy climbing down the tree to chase it. Chase! Chase! He chased for a long time but couldn't catch it. The sun was slanting. He walked home dejectedly, and met Hei Ni halfway. When Hei Ni saw him, she shamed him: "Playing truant! Little Zhong'er!"
　　The next day, Grandpa sent him to school. As soon as he entered the classroom door, the morning class had already started. Grandpa instructed the teacher: "Teacher, please discipline him for me, be stricter!" Grandpa left, and Little Zhong'er walked to his seat. Everyone's eyes were fixed on him. Zhong'er's heart was thumping, and he looked hard at the teacher, afraid of being humiliated. But the teacher didn't raise her eyebrows or glare at him, just told Little Zhong'er to sit down and told everyone to continue learning to write slips. Little Zhong'er's heart was even more chaotic. He finally waited for the class to end, but the teacher called him to the front of the blackboard. She smiled and said to everyone: "Let me recite a clapper talk for everyone!" Everyone was happy and shouted "Good!" The teacher recited: "Brothers and grandpas dig big canals, sisters and mothers deliver manure, Zhong'er plays truant to catch black cats, Hei Ni reads and learns to recognize words. Everyone says which of the two is better?" Little Zhong'er blushed for the first time, and took the teacher's hand and said: "Teacher! Don't recite anymore, I won't play truant anymore!"
　　The habit of playing truant was cured, and Little Zhong'er came up with new tricks. He picked up several small pieces of wood from Wang the carpenter, and found a small knife, and whittled the wood back and forth, and whittled it into a small coffin. Whoever fought with him, he would stomp his foot and wave the small coffin: "I'll put you in the coffin and bury you!" He would squat down and twist a clod of earth into the coffin, then dig a small pit with his hand, bury the coffin in it, and chant while burying the soil: "Lin Xiao! Lin Xiao! Buried alive in a coffin." Lin Xiao was so angry that he cried and ran to the teacher to complain. After school, the teacher took Little Zhong'er and sat on the steps, and asked him: "Zhong'er, who does the teacher like?" Zhong'er rolled his eyes, lowered his head and said softly: "She likes Lan Ying, Yin Suo, and Hei Ni!" "Why?" "They study hard and learn to read." "Does the teacher like Zhong'er?" Little Zhong'er said a soft "No." The teacher asked him again: "Why?" "I play truant and I'm naughty." The teacher smiled and touched his head and said: "If Zhong'er learns well, the teacher will like Zhong'er." "But I can't learn anything well!" "Can't you whittle small coffins out of wood? The teacher will teach you to whittle small spoons out of wood! This is useful, this is good." The teacher took Zhong'er into the house, drew a pattern for him, and Zhong'er began to whittle. In just two days, he whittled quite well. The teacher found several elementary school students and formed a small spoon-whittling group. Because Little Zhong'er whittled well, everyone elected him as the group leader. Little Zhong'er was so happy! After finishing his studies, he taught others to whittle wooden spoons, and he wasn't naughty anymore. He also put more effort into learning.
　　One day, Grandpa ran to ask the teacher to write a slip. The teacher talked to Little Zhong'er about it, and he gave Grandpa a slip with one stroke at a time. Grandpa took it and looked at it horizontally and vertically, and his eyes smiled into a slit! He said: "Teacher, you are really good! There is one more thing, you have to bother with, Zhong'er doesn't like to work when he gets home, he has to change that." The teacher sent Grandpa out, and the two talked for a long time, and Little Zhong'er began to mutter in his heart again.
　　In the evening, the teacher came, and his mother wiped the kang table clean, and placed an oil lamp on it. The flame flickered, illuminating the teacher's face with a bright light. Her eyes were brighter, and her dimples were deeper. Little Zhong'er looked at the teacher, looked at his mother, and looked at his grandfather, and he couldn't understand what was going on: "What is this for?" Grandpa pushed and shoved with the teacher for a long time, and then said: "Let's have a family meeting today! Everyone can talk about their own opinions." His mother was the first to speak: "I have been cooking these two days, either making flatbreads or steaming dry food. I don't know how to save money and live frugally. I don't plan ahead, and I'm worried that there won't be anything to eat when it's time to hoe three times." While listening to his mother and grandfather's opinions, Little Zhong'er was calculating in his little heart; he thought for a long time before saying: "Let me give my mother an opinion! My mother doesn't like to go to the people's school, and she can't even write letters to my father." Later, Grandpa also gave Little Zhong'er an opinion: "Little Zhong'er is right, Zhong'er's mother can't read and doesn't like to go to the people's school, that's not good. Zhong'er's mother works hard in the fields, other women can't compare with her, that's better than Little Zhong'er. Little Zhong'er doesn't like to work when he gets home, that's not as good as your mother." His mother also said: "As soon as Zhong'er gets home, he drops his schoolbag and goes out to play. Look at Hei Ni, she helps her mother sweep the floor when she gets home!" Little Zhong'er was watching the teacher while listening. His face turned red again. After the opinions were put forward, the whole family discussed a plan for farming and living. Finally, the teacher helped Little Zhong'er make a plan to go to school, learn to read, and come home to work. Little Zhong'er thought to himself: "Just watch! The next time we have a meeting, I'll make sure Grandpa praises me."
　　A few days later, Little Zhong'er walked down the street and saw many people gathered in front of the blackboard newspaper. Sister Lan Ying was reading to everyone! As soon as Little Zhong'er walked over, Yin Suo and Hei Ni clapped their hands. Little Zhong'er opened his mouth wide and stared. There were many "roadblocks" on it. Sister Lan Ying said: "Let me read it to Little Zhong'er again!" She slowly read again: "Family meetings are really good, Grandpa hoes and weeds the ground, Mother feeds the pigs and picks seedlings, Zhong'er makes a small plan, chopping wood and carrying water are even more diligent!" It's glorious enough to be on the blackboard newspaper! From then on, Little Zhong'er changed day by day. After school, he went home to help his mother feed the pigs and carry water. When the water tank was full, he picked up his small manure basket and went to collect manure. Hei Ni never shamed him again, and called him a little model when she saw him.
　　After the autumn harvest, Little Zhong'er could not only write slips and calculate abacus, but also wrote a letter to his father: "Dear Father, how are you? Mother and Grandpa are well, and I am well too. This year's crops are strong, the corn cobs are growing long, the piglets are round and rolling, Grandpa says this year we will have a good life, we won't have to worry about food and clothing, Mother says Father can rest assured! Kill a few more devils on the front line, everyone is happy. Little Zhong'er."

　　小钟儿
    蔡迪
    柳树发芽了！太阳照在身上暖洋洋的，小钟儿跑到树底下，才那么几步，就出了满头大汗。他把小棉袄一脱，往树底下一摔，用手一抹脸，手上的土沾上汗，立时划了一脸黑道道。银锁、黑妮、林小瞧见他这鬼模样，拍手大笑，气得小钟儿拾起一块土坷垃打过去，偏巧村长走过来，不歪不斜正正打在村长的脚上，村长站住吆喊他：“小钟儿！你又淘气啦！”小钟儿正没好气，要想狠狠回一句，突然看见村长旁边还跟着一个个子不大的女同志，圆圆的脸，圆圆的一对晶亮晶亮的黑眼睛，朝着他们笑。钟儿楞了。村长一边朝前走，一边回头跟他说：“这就是你们的新老师，明天上学去吧！”
    一提上学，可碰上小钟儿的心病了。他今年十一岁，爸爸参加解放军三年多了，家里还有妈妈和一个老爷爷。妈妈因为爸爸不在家，特别心痛他，爷爷因为只有这么一个小孙孙，也特别心痛他。妈妈因为钟儿在外边净挑皮闯祸，要揍他，爷爷护着；爷爷因为钟儿不好生干营生，要揍他，妈妈护着。小钟儿摸着这个门道，在家天不怕地不怕，到了外边还是什么也不怕，成天领着孩子们玩，什么掏鸟蛋啦，骑大花狗打仗啦，打炮楼埋地雷啦……各式各样的办法，一天搞一个样。别的孩子常受他的欺侮，可是又喜欢和他玩，因为他的花招多。小钟儿一来就拍着胸脯吆喝：“来呀！”黑妮、银锁、林小一大群孩子，就从四面八方跑过来，跟他玩去了。学校的教员顶讨厌他，因为他淘气，净领着孩子们把课堂闹得一团糟，去年小钟儿才上学没多久，有一天，那个王老师正往黑板上写生字，小钟儿早学的不耐烦了，偷偷的把这几天捉来的一篓篓蜢蚱，一下子放出来，忽拉拉就飞了一课堂。银锁跳起来就抓，黑妮蹦起来就赶，小娃娃吓得直叫老师。王老师回过身眼睛瞪得铜铃大，什么也不问，一把拉过小钟儿，不加教育，只狠狠地责备一番。从那回起，小钟儿特别恨学校，不满意老师，他是死活不上学了！这回新教员又来了，小钟儿的心病也又患了。可是这个小先生也真怪，放了学，帮助这家收拾纺车，帮助那家推碾子，写信，嫂子大娘的认了一大堆。小钟儿的心也就更揪得紧了。就怕小先生进他家门来。那天吃罢后晌饭，村长来了，小钟儿咬着下嘴唇，蹲在窗根底下偷听，村长说：“明天开学了，早点叫小钟子起来上学呀！”爷爷答应着，回头对妈妈说：“钟儿妈，明早叫小钟起来上学啊！”
    小钟儿一听爷爷说上学，心里可有点慌。可是，没办法，第二天一早就被妈妈叫起来上学去了。
    小钟儿上了学，头两天埋着头学写字，过两天家里门板上、墙上、水缸上到处都写上了歪歪扭扭的“中国人”。又过两天，个个“中国人”旁边，又写上了斜斜倒倒的“小中儿”。又过两天字旁边又画了一大片人头、小狗、大毛驴。小钟儿上学腻烦了。吃罢早起饭，看见村长他们正往村东去挖大渠，人可多啦！小钟儿跑去看烘火，这串串那串串，一会太阳就正了，他忙着往回走，忽然看见大榆树上有个大黑猫，瞪着圆眼睛，朝着他咪呜咪呜的叫，他急急忙忙上树去抓，大黑猫更伶巧，轻轻一跳就下树跑了，小钟儿也忙着翻下树去追，追呀！追呀！追了半天也没追上，太阳可斜了。他垂头丧气的往家走，半路上碰见黑妮，黑妮一见他，就羞他：“逃学啦！小钟儿！”
    第二天爷爷送他来上学，一进课堂门，人家早上课了。爷爷嘱咐小先生：“先生，替我管教管教他，要管的严一点！”爷爷走了，小钟儿走到座位跟前，大伙眼睛都盯住他，钟儿心里卜通卜通跳，使劲看先生，害怕要受羞辱。可是小先生也没立眉毛也没瞪眼睛，光叫小钟儿坐下，叫大伙照旧学开路条。小钟儿心更乱啦，好容易盼到课上完，小先生却把他叫到黑板跟前，她笑着对大伙说：“我给大伙念个快板吧！”大家高兴得喊好，小先生就念了：“哥哥爷爷挖大渠，姐姐妈妈送粪去，钟儿逃学捉黑猫，黑妮念书又识字。大家说说这俩个谁好？”小钟儿头一回脸红了，拉着小先生手说：“先生！别念了，我可不逃学啦！”
    逃学的毛病治好了，小钟儿又出了新花招。他打王木匠那里拾来好几块小木头，又找了一把小刀刀，把木头剜过来剜过去，就剜成了一个小棺材，谁要一跟他打架，他就一跺脚，把小棺材拿出来一幌：“我把你装进棺材里埋了！”他就蹲下捻一块土坷垃装进棺材，又用手刨个小坑坑，把棺材埋进去，一边埋土，一边念叨：“林小！林小！进了棺材活埋了。”气得林小直啼哭跑去找先生告状。放学以后，小先生拉着小钟儿，坐在台阶上，问他：“钟儿，先生喜欢谁呀？”钟儿翻了翻眼睛，低下头小声说：“喜欢兰英、银锁、黑妮！”“为什么呀？”“他们好生念书识字。”“先生喜欢钟儿吗？”小钟儿小声的说个“不”，先生又问他：“为什么呀？”“我又逃学又挑皮。”小先生笑了，用手摸着他的头说：“钟儿学好，先生就喜欢钟儿。”“可是我什么也学不好呀！”“你不是会用木头剜小棺材吗？先生教给你拿木头剜小杓杓吧！这个有用，这个就好。”小先生拉钟儿进屋去，给他画好样子，小钟儿就剜起来了，才两天工夫，他就剜得挺象样了。小先生就找出几个小学生，编成一个剜木杓杓小组，大家因为小钟儿剜得好，就选他当了小组长。小钟儿多高兴呀！念完了书就教别人剜木杓杓，再不淘气了。学习也加劲了。
    有一天，爷爷跑来求小先生开个路条，小先生跟小钟儿说了说，他就一笔一画的给爷爷开了一个路条，爷爷拿过来横着看看竖着看看，欢喜得眼睛笑成一条缝了！他说：“先生，你真行了！还有一桩事，你还得费心，钟儿回了家不爱干活了，还得改改。”小先生送出爷爷去，两个说了半天话，小钟儿心里又嘀咕起来。
    晚上，小先生来了，妈妈把炕桌抹得干干净净的，又摆上一盏油灯，灯焰一闪一跳的，照在小先生脸上一片明，她的眼睛更亮，笑窝更深了，小钟儿看看先生，看看妈妈，看看爷爷，心里又想不通了：“这是干什么呀？”爷爷跟小先生推让半天，就说了：“今天咱们开个家庭会吧！个人说说个人的意见。”妈妈头一炮发言说：“我这两天作饭，不是贴饼子就是蒸干粮，不会省着过日子，没打算，往后锄三遍时候没的吃就糟心了。”小钟儿一边听着妈妈、爷爷提意见，一边在小心眼里打算盘；想了半天才说：“我给妈妈提个意见吧！妈妈不爱上民校，连给爸爸写信都不会。”后来爷爷也给小钟儿提意见了：“小钟儿说得对，钟儿妈不识字又不爱上民校可不好，钟儿妈种地受苦别的妇女比不上这可比小钟儿好，小钟儿回了家不爱干活，可比不上你妈。”妈妈也说：“钟儿一回家撂下书包，就出去玩了，你看人家黑妮，回了家就帮他娘扫地！”小钟儿一边听，一边偷看小先生。他的脸又红了，意见提完，全家人又商量了种地过日子的计划。末后，小先生又帮助小钟儿作了个上学识字回家干活的计划，小钟儿心想：“瞧着吧！下回开会准得叫爷爷夸夸才行。”
    过了几天，小钟儿走过大街上，看见黑板报跟前围了好多人，兰英姐姐正给大伙念哩！小钟儿一走过去，银锁、黑妮都拍起手来。小钟儿张大嘴瞪着眼睛一看，上边好些“拦路虎”。兰英姐姐说：“我再念给小钟儿听听吧！”她慢慢的又念了：“家庭会议真叫好，爷爷耪地锄草，妈妈喂猪捡苗，钟儿作个小计划，打柴抬水更勤劳！”上了黑板报够多光荣呀！从此小钟儿一天比一天变了，放了学，回家就忙着帮妈妈喂猪、抬水，水缸满了，又挎起小粪筐拾粪去了。黑妮再也不羞他，见了他就叫他小模范。
    过了大秋，小钟儿不光会开路条，会打算子，还给爸爸写了一封信：“爸爸，你好吗？妈妈、爷爷都好，我也好，今年庄家（稼）强，马牙棒子一个棒吹（棰）长，小猪棍棍（滚滚）圆，爷爷说今年日子好过了，吃穿不愁了，妈妈说爸爸放心吧！在前方多杀几个鬼子，大家高兴。小钟儿”。
