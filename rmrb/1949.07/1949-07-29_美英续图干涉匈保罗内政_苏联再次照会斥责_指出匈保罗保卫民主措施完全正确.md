　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 27th: TASS reports from Moscow: In April of this year, the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom delivered notes to the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, condemning the three countries for violating the terms of the peace treaty. The governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania rejected these condemnations, considering them baseless and attempts by the US and UK governments to interfere in their internal affairs.

　　On May 31st, the US and UK governments again sent notes to the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, claiming that disputes had arisen between the US and UK governments and the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania regarding the interpretation of the peace treaty. At the same time, the US and UK suggested to the Soviet Union that a meeting be convened of the heads of the diplomatic missions of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom in Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria to consider the disputed issues.

　　On June 11th, the Soviet government sent notes to the US and UK governments, informing them that the Soviet Union saw no reason to convene a meeting of the heads of the three countries' diplomatic missions and that the Soviet Union believed that the US and UK governments' desire to make the interpretation of the peace treaty a dispute was a direct attempt to use the peace treaty to interfere in the internal affairs of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, thereby exerting pressure on the internal affairs of those countries.

　　However, in a note sent to the Soviet government on June 30th, the US and UK governments once again raised the issue of convening a meeting of the heads of the three countries' diplomatic missions.

　　On July 19th, the Soviet Embassy in Washington delivered a written reply to the US government, reiterating that the Soviet government could not accept the reasons given by the United States, and in particular could not agree with the US assertion that the measures taken by the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania in their internal administration to defend democracy from pro-fascist and other similar groups were in violation of the peace treaty.

　　The note stated that, as the Soviet government pointed out in its note of June 11th of this year, such measures by the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania did not constitute a violation of the peace treaty, but were in accordance with the objectives stipulated in the peace treaty, which stipulated that the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania had the obligation to take measures to dissolve fascist-style organizations and prevent the existence and activities of such groups that were hostile to the democratic rights of the people.

　　After rebuking the US for distorting the peace treaty, the Soviet note stated that the Soviet Union's position remained unchanged.

　　The same note was simultaneously delivered to the British government through the Soviet Embassy in London.

　　美英续图干涉匈保罗内政
  　苏联再次照会斥责
    指出匈保罗保卫民主措施完全正确
    【新华社北平二十七日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：美国和英国政府在本年四月，曾以照会递交保加利亚、匈牙利和罗马尼亚三国政府，谴责三国违反和约条款。保、匈、罗三国政府拒斥了这些谴责，认为这是毫无根据的，是美英政府干涉它们内政的企图。
    五月三十一日，美英政府再度以照会致送保、匈、罗政府，声称：美英政府与保、匈、罗政府间已在和约的解释上发生争执。同时美英两国向苏联建议，召集苏联、美国和英国驻匈、罗、保三国的外交使团的首脑举行会议，以考虑争执的问题。
    六月十一日，苏联政府以照会致送美英两国政府，通知它们：苏联认为没有召集三国外交使团首脑举行会议的理由，而且认为美英两国政府要使和约的解释成为争执的愿望，系直接企图利用和约来干涉保、匈、罗三国的内政，从而对各该国的内政施以压力。
    然而，美英两国政府在六月三十日致送苏联政府的照会中，仍再度提出召集三国外交使团首脑会议的问题。
    七月十九日，苏联驻华盛顿大使馆以照会复文送交美国政府，再度声明：苏联政府不能接受美国所持的理由，特别是不能同意美国的断言，说什么保、匈、罗三国政府，为保卫民主免于亲法西斯与其他同类团体的侵害而在内政管理方面所采取的措施，系违反和约。
    照会称：如苏联政府曾在本年六月十一日照会中指出的，保、匈、罗三国政府的此种措施，绝不构成违反和约的行为，而系遵循和约所规定的目的，和约规定保、匈、罗三国政府有义务采取措施，解散法西斯式的团体及防止此种敌视人民民主权利的团体之存在与活动。
    苏联照会在斥责美国曲解和约的行为后，声明苏联所持的立场不变。
    同样的照会同时经由苏联驻伦敦大使馆送交英国政府。
