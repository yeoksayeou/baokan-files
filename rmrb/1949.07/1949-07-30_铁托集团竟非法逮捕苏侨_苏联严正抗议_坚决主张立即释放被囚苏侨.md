　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 29th: TASS Moscow reports: Following its policy of hostility towards the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav authorities have been arresting large numbers of Soviet citizens residing in Yugoslavia, while simultaneously depriving representatives of the Soviet Embassy of the possibility of providing assistance and defense to those arrested. On July 25th, the Soviet Embassy in Belgrade, on the instructions of the Soviet government, sent a note to the Yugoslav government regarding this matter, which stated:
    "The Soviet government, through its embassy in Yugoslavia, makes the following declaration to the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs:
    According to information obtained by the embassy, the Yugoslav authorities continue to subject Soviet citizens residing in Yugoslavia to numerous acts of reprisal. Numerous cases of arrest of Soviet citizens have occurred, with those arrested being held in Yugoslav prisons without indictment. Moreover, generally, they are not brought to trial or investigated for many months without reason. This proves that the actual reason why the Yugoslav authorities subject Soviet citizens to acts of reprisal is not that they have committed any crime, but merely because the Yugoslav authorities know that they are advocates of friendly relations between the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples.
    It must be pointed out that the Yugoslav authorities have established an absolutely intolerable system of tyrannical imprisonment for those arrested, subjecting prisoners to cruel violence, torture, and all forms of abuse, starving and sickening them. The prison administration illegally deprives imprisoned Soviet citizens of food, even the sick are not spared, thereby endangering their health and lives. As a result of the abuse and illegal actions of the Yugoslav authorities, many of those arrested are in a state of exhaustion and deteriorating health. Protests lodged by prisoners with the prison administration against this inhumane system have never had any effect, and the situation of the imprisoned Soviet citizens deteriorates day by day, especially those listed in the attached list (thirty-one people) who are imprisoned in Yugoslav prisons. The embassy reminds the Yugoslav government that such mistreatment of Soviet citizens is inexcusable and firmly demands an immediate end to the brutal treatment of Soviet citizens, and the immediate release of all Soviet citizens illegally imprisoned in Yugoslav prisons."

　　铁托集团竟非法逮捕苏侨
  　苏联严正抗议
    坚决主张立即释放被囚苏侨
    【新华社北平二十九日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：南斯拉夫当局遵循着敌视苏联的政策，大批逮捕常居南斯拉夫的苏联公民，同时并剥夺苏联大使馆代表予被捕者以帮助与辩护的可能性。苏联驻贝尔格莱德大使馆奉苏联政府之命，于七月二十五日就此事致南斯拉夫政府照会一件，内称：
    “苏联政府政权苏联大使馆向南斯拉夫外交部作如下声明：
    据大使馆获得的消息，南斯拉夫当局使常居于南斯拉夫的苏联公民遭受许多报复行为的情事仍在继续中。许多苏联公民被捕案件发生了，被捕者被关在南斯拉夫的监狱里，不加起诉。而且一般地许多月来毫无理由地不予提审，又不调查。这证明，南斯拉夫当局使苏联公民遭受报复行为的实际原因，并非在于他们犯了任何罪过，而仅仅是在于南斯拉夫当局知道他们是南苏两国人民友好关系的倡导者。
    必须指出，南斯拉夫当局已建立起绝对使人难以忍受的横暴监禁被捕者的制度，使被囚者遭受残酷的暴力、拷打及一切虐待，使他们受饿和害病。监狱管理部门非法地剥夺了被监禁的苏联公民的食物，即使是病人也不能幸免，因而危及他们的健康与生命。由于南斯拉夫当局的虐待与非法行动的结果，许多被捕者已处于憔悴不堪和健康败坏的状态中。被囚者向监狱行政当局提出的对此不人道制度的抗议，没有一次获得任何效果，而被囚禁的苏联公民的情况则一天比一天恶化，特别是本照会附有的名单（三十一人）中所列的被囚禁在南斯拉夫监狱的苏联公民。本大使馆特提醒南斯拉夫政府注意，如此虐待苏联公民是不可饶恕的，并坚决要求立即停止对苏联公民的暴虐行为，立即释放非法囚禁在南斯拉夫监狱中的一切苏联公民。”
