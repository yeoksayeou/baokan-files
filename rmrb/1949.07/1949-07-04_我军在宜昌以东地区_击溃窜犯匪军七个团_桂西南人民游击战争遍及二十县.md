Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 2nd: It is late to report that a unit of the People's Liberation Army annihilated the entire 194th Division and the 199th Division, 98th Division, and Jiangling Puppet Security Regiment, totaling seven regiments of the Kuomintang bandit troops fleeing westward, in the Yangjiawan area of Jiangling, east of Yichang, on the 20th of last month. They captured 302 enemy officers and soldiers alive, killed more than 100 enemies, and seized one mortar, two 60mm guns, sixteen light machine guns, 103 long and short guns, and some ammunition.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: A unit of the People's Liberation Army's Guangxi-Dian-Qian Border Column, which has been persisting in the anti-enemy guerrilla war in southwestern Guangxi, has achieved great victories and development in the past six months. The people's guerrilla war has spread to twenty counties, including Longzhou, Wancheng, Wuming, Guode, Jingxi, and Zhenbian in the Zuojiang and Youjiang areas. In mid-May, the PLA unit liberated Funing County, a strategic location on the border of Guangxi and Yunnan, creating favorable conditions for future development on a broader scale. In the aforementioned areas, the people's armed forces launched a propaganda campaign about the victory of the People's Liberation War and mobilized the peasants to carry out struggles against conscription, grain requisition, and taxation in resistance to the Kuomintang's tyranny. Through these struggles, the class consciousness of the peasant masses has been preliminarily raised. They have organized mass organizations such as peasant associations, with tens of thousands of participants. The bandits Li and Bai in Guangxi Province, under the victorious development of the people's armed forces, are actively expanding the reactionary local armed forces in various counties and organizing joint defense teams, attempting to carry out cruel suppression. However, under the victorious situation of the nationwide Liberation War, the reactionary armed forces in various places are very shaken, and entire units have surrendered with their weapons.

　　我军在宜昌以东地区
  　击溃窜犯匪军七个团
    桂西南人民游击战争遍及二十县
    【新华社汉口二日电】迟到：人民解放军一部上月二十日在宜昌以东的江陵杨家湾地区，击溃自西窜犯之国民党匪军一九四师全部及一九九师、九十八师及江陵伪保安团共七个团的兵力，活捉敌官兵三百零二名，打死敌人一百多名，缴获迫击炮一门，六零炮二门，轻机枪十六挺，长短枪一百零三支，及弹药一部。
    【新华社北平三日电】坚持广西西南部敌后游击战争的人民解放军桂滇黔边纵队一部，半年来获得很大胜利与发展。人民游击战争已遍及左江、右江的龙州、万承、武鸣、果德、靖西、镇边等二十个县。五月中旬该部解放军曾解放了桂滇边要地富宁县城，给今后更广大范围的发展造成了有利条件。在上述地区内，人民武装展开了关于人民解放战争胜利的宣传运动，发动了农民实行抗丁、抗粮、抗税的反抗国民党暴政的斗争，经过这些斗争，农民群众的阶级觉悟，有了初步提高。他们组织了农会等群众组织，参加者在数万以上。桂省李、白诸匪，在人民武装胜利发展下，正积极扩编各县的反动地方武装，编组联防队，企图进行残酷的镇压；但在全国解放战争胜利形势下，各地反动武装非常动摇，已有成股缴械投诚的。
