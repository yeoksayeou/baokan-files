　　[Urgent Telegram from Ji-Lu-Yu, 29th] The water level at Shanzhou dropped at 16:00 on the 27th, with the water level at 293.89 meters, a decrease of 3.17 meters compared to yesterday's 297.06 meters, and a flow rate of 4989.95 cubic meters per second. However, the maximum flow rate of over 15,000 cubic meters per second lasted for 24 hours, and the flood peak has not yet reached Gao Cun, so the danger is still acute.
　　On the 27th, a dangerous situation occurred in the Simingtang area at the junction of Dongming and Kaocheng. By 24:00, the flood reached Zhukou and Liuzhuang, and the dangerous works were submerged. By 3:00 AM on the 28th, the 9th and 10th dikes had been rescued from the water surface through all-out repairs, while the 50th dike was still submerged. From 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM on the 28th, the water level at Gao Cun was 61.25 meters, with a flow rate of 10,850 cubic meters per second. This was the highest flood peak, lasting for three hours, and by 5:00 AM, it gradually decreased. Now the flood peak had passed Jiangsu Dike at 8:00 AM on the 28th. The 15th and 18th dikes in that section are rapidly collapsing due to the main current eroding the edges, and repairs are underway. It is estimated that the Juancheng section will enter a stage of intense rescue work on the evening of the 28th. Two engineering teams were transferred from Zhongmu and Kaifeng to reinforce Zhukou.
　　[Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] After receiving the news of the second surge in the Yellow River water level, the Yellow River Commission immediately convened an emergency meeting, notifying all river defense offices, sections, and local party and government responsible cadres by telephone to immediately lead the masses in protection. The second emergency meeting decided: 1. The water situation should be based on the Yellow River Commission's announcements, and all localities should inform the masses of the water situation at any time, and strictly prevent special agents from spreading rumors and inciting people; 2. After temporary flood control personnel go to the dikes, they must earnestly check flood control tools, check ditches and wave depressions on the dike line, and check caves; 3. Consult with the military region and notify the Yellow River Command to prepare boats to rescue residents submerged in the riverbed, and the repair and defense offices and sections should also prepare civilian boats for this work; 4. The Yellow River Commission and the District Party Committee should prepare cadres, vehicles, and equipment for emergency rescue at any time. After receiving this instruction, all localities immediately took action. The Fan District Committee has sent cadres to the dikes, and Ma Guanqun, Commissioner of the 7th Administrative Office, rushed to the dikes on the 27th. Most of the county magistrates of the counties along the river have also gone to the dikes to lead protection. In addition to the original flood control personnel on the river dikes, temporary flood control personnel have also gone to the dikes. Above Liuyuan in the Puyang County section, a flood control house is set up every 1,000 meters, with the number of flood control personnel increased to twelve per house. Cadres from various repair and defense offices and sections have also gone to various sections and stations to provide specific leadership, and rescue and prevention teams along the river are also preparing equipment, ready to be dispatched. In general, the party, government, army, and people along the entire river are in a state of high tension, waiting in full battle array.
　　[Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] The Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office convened more than 70 responsible persons from its subordinate and various administrative offices and county governments' transportation sections on July 12 to hold a flood control meeting. The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to overcome complacency and made specific provisions for engineering issues.

　　黄河陕州水位降落
  　下游险情仍紧干部群众正抢修中
    【冀鲁豫二十九日急电】陕州二十七日十六时水势降落，水位为二九三点八九公尺，较昨日二九七点○六公尺落三点一七公尺，流量为四九八九点九五秒立方公尺。但自昨日最大流量一五○○○秒立方公尺以上共持续二十四小时，洪水峰迄未达到高村，险情仍紧。
    二十七日东明、考城交界处四明堂一带发生险象，至二十四时洪水到朱口、刘庄，险工下蛰入水，二十八日晨三时，第九、第十两坝，经全力抢修已抢出水面，第五十坝仍在下蛰中。高村二十八日二时至四时，水位六一点二五公尺，流量一○八五○秒立方公尺，此为最高洪水峰，持续三小时后，至五时，徐徐下降，现洪水峰已于二十八日八时过江苏坝。该段第十五、十八两坝因大溜绞边，急剧掉蛰，正抢修中，估计二十八日晚鄄城段即进入紧张抢险阶段。并从中牟、开封调两个工程队增援朱口。
    【冀鲁豫电】黄水二次水位暴涨的消息传来后，黄委会立即召开了紧急会议，电话通知沿河各修防处、段和当地党政负责干部，立即领导群众防护。在第二次紧急会议中则决定：一、水情以黄委会通报为标准，各地应将水情随时告诉群众，并应严防特务造谣，煽惑人心；二、临时防汛员上堤后，要切实检查防汛工具，检查堤线上的水沟浪窝，检查洞狐穴；三、商请军区，通知黄河指挥部备好船只，以便抢救河床被淹居民，各修防处、段亦准备民船做这一工作；四、黄委会和区党委准备好干部、汽车和器材，以备随时出发抢险。各地接此一指示后，皆即行动起来。现有范地委已派干部上堤，七专署专员马冠群已于二十七日赶到堤上；沿河各县县长，也绝大多数上了堤，领导防护。沿河堤线除原有之防汛员外，临时防汛员也纷纷上堤。在濮县段柳园以上，每千公尺设一防汛屋，每屋增至十二名防汛员。各修防处段干部，亦分赴各段各站具体领导，沿河各抢险预防队也都在准备器材，听命出动。总观沿河全线党政军民均已进入高度紧张状态，严阵以待。
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫行政公署于七月十二日召集所属及各专署、县府交通科负责人七十余人，开防汛会议。会议指出必须克服麻痹倾向，并对工程问题作了具体规定。
