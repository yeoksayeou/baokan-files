Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th – Just as severe floods are occurring in areas awaiting liberation, with large areas of farmland submerged and peasants displaced, the Guangzhou Kuomintang remnant bandits, in the name of a bogus "Executive Yuan Meeting," passed a "Implementation Measures for the Collection of Grain and Levying of Grain Loans for the 38th Year" on the 22nd, preparing to plunder grain from peasants in areas awaiting liberation on a large scale. The "Measures" stipulate that grain will be collected in kind from grain-producing areas and military grain-needed areas, while silver coins will be collected in areas with inconvenient transportation and no need for supplies. In addition to the grain levied with the tax, provinces, counties, and cities can also levy "public grain" with the tax. It also stipulates that for the grain loans levied by the bandits in previous years that are due for repayment this year, all will be "repaid" with a "public bond," and no more deductions will be made from the field tax or returned in kind. This is, in effect, outrightly depriving the peasants of their right to demand repayment from the bandits for the grain loans already levied.

　　广州残余匪帮拼死压榨人民
  　大肆掠取待解放区农民粮食
    【新华社北平二十六日电】正当待解放区发生严重水灾，大量农田被淹，农民流离失所的时候，广州国民党残余匪帮又于二十二日以伪“行政院会议”的名义通过一项“三十八年度出赋征暨征借粮食实施办法”，准备大肆掠取待解放区农民粮食。该“办法”规定：粮产区及军粮需要地区征收实物，交通不便及不需要补给之地区则折收银币，除随赋征借粮食外，省县市并可随赋带征“公粮”。又规定匪帮历年征借粮食本年到期应偿还者，一律以一纸“公债”“偿还”，不再抵缴田赋或拨还实物，这实际上就是干脆剥夺农民对已征借粮食向匪帮要求偿还的权利。
