　　【Chahar News】The main points of the Chahar Provincial People's Government's instructions on planting trees during the rainy season are as follows:
　　Now that the summer solstice has passed, and it is a time of continuous rainy days, all localities must seize the opportunity to immediately mobilize all possible forces to carry out afforestation during the rainy season. Key areas must be equipped with professional cadres to carry out shock work. Although various localities lack experience in planting trees during the rainy season, planting trees during the rainy season in arid and sandy areas is far easier to survive than planting trees in the spring. According to an inspection in Nanzhang Village, the Second District of Dingxing, the survival rate of afforestation in dry sandy beaches in the spring of last year was less than 30%, while the survival rate of afforestation in the rainy season was over 70%. The survival rate of planting trees in Laiyuan during the rainy season last year was over 80%. As for the relatively humid areas on the sides of dikes, dam soil, and along the banks of rivers, it is even easier to survive. Whether it is dry land or sandy beaches in preventing wind and sand, or along river areas in preventing floods, large-scale planting should be carried out. When leading the masses to plant trees, it is required that administrative leadership, technical guidance, and propaganda and education be closely combined to overcome the conservative ideas of the masses who lack confidence in summer tree planting, and ensure the realization of the rainy season afforestation plan. In addition, in order to strengthen management and ensure the survival rate of trees, in addition to promptly identifying the planted trees as forest areas and thoroughly implementing the forest protection policy, it should be announced that whoever plants the trees owns them, but the land rights of public land with use value can be retained. If trees are planted on private idle land, dividends can be appropriately distributed according to the principle of mutual benefit. The province requires a total of 10,350,000 trees to be planted during the rainy season, 2,465 mu of bank protection and flood prevention forests, 3,905 mu of wind and sand prevention forests, and 26,870 mu of wasteland to be sown.

　　察省人民政府号召雨后植树
    【察哈尔讯】察省人民政府雨季植树的指示要点如下：
    现在夏至已过，且值连日阴雨，各地须抓紧时机立即动员一切可能使用的力量，进行雨季造林。重点地区并须配备专业干部进行突击。各地虽对雨季植树缺少经验，但在干旱及沙性地区，雨季植树却远较春季植树容易成活。据定兴二区南章村检查，去年春季在旱地沙滩造林，成活率不到百分之三十，而雨季造林则成活百分之七十以上。涞源去年雨季植树成活率在百分之八十以上。至于堤侧、坝土、沿河两边土地较潮湿处，则更易成活。不论旱地、沙滩在屏止风沙上，与沿河地区在防止水患上，均应大量栽植。领导群众栽植时，要求行政领导。技术指导与宣传教育密切结合，打通群众对夏季植树缺乏信心的保守思想，保证雨季造林计划的实现。此外，为加强管理，保证提高林木的成活率，除将已栽之树及时确定林区，并深入贯彻护林政策外，应宣布谁栽归谁，但对有使用价值之公地可以保留地权。如在私有的闲地上植树者，可根据两利原则，适当分红，全省要求在雨季共植树一千零三十五万棵，要求植造护岸防洪林二千四百六十五亩，防风防沙林三千九百零五亩，荒山播种两万六千八百七十亩。
