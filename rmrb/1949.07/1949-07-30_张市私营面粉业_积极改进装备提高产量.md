　　Zhangjiakou Private Flour Industry
　　Actively Improves Equipment and Increases Production
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] After Zhangjiakou implemented the policy on industry and commerce, private industrialists and merchants dispelled ideological concerns. Especially after visiting the Beiping Industrial Exhibition, they have been more actively improving technology and equipment to improve product quality. Industries such as cast iron, machinery manufacturing, flour, and leather making have achieved considerable results. Yisheng Cast Iron Pot Factory previously produced a maximum of forty pots per day. On rainy days, the pot molds became damp and could not be cast. Now, the factory is actively building a mold baking building. After completion at the end of July, pot casting can be guaranteed even on cloudy and rainy days, and production will increase by 50%. In order to reduce costs, Tongmao Pot Factory is now planning to add an electric mill to replace manual grinding of materials (coal dust, silver powder, etc.). Several flour manufacturing businesses, with the support of the People's Government, have been transformed into mechanized flour mills. The newly opened Ruifeng Flour Mill received a loan of one million yuan (People's Currency) and purchased a steel roller milling machine from Tianjin. Tongju Grain Depot recently changed to flour manufacturing. The depot had original capital of eight million yuan and borrowed another two million yuan from the government to purchase three steel roller milling machines from Tianjin, which will be put into production in mid-August. Demao Sheng and other three stone mill flour factories are also planning to purchase steel roller machines. Fuli Yong and Fuheng Yong have merged their operations and are also planning to improve their machinery and equipment. There are still many private flour mills in Zhangjiakou, but due to capital constraints, it is not easy to completely switch to new-style machines in the short term. In order to assist these flour mills in improving product quality on their existing basis, Deshun and Jusheng Iron Factories are now rushing to manufacture a more economical mechanized flour mill – a steel plate mill. Deshun Iron Factory has already produced one unit. After trial use by Wanxincheng Flour Mill, the effect is good. It can produce 800 jin of flour per day, doubling the efficiency of the old-style steel plate mill (daily output of 400 jin). In addition, Deshun Iron Factory is now designing and creating new-style chaff cutters and small oil presses for use throughout the region. The leather manufacturing industry in Zhangjiakou is also striving to improve its technology in order to open up sales channels. (Lü Guangming)

　　张市私营面粉业
  　积极改进装备提高产量
    【本报讯】张家口贯彻工商业政策后，私营工商业解除了思想顾虑，特别参观北平工业展览会归来后，更积极改进技术、装备，提高产品质量。铸铁、机器制造、面粉、制革等业，并已获不少成绩。益生铸锅厂，以前日产量最多四十口锅，下雨天锅模返潮，就不能开铸，现该厂正积极修建烤模楼，七月底完工后，则阴天下雨也能保证铸锅，生产将增加百分之五十。同茂锅厂为减低成本，现正要添建电碾一座，代替人力碾材料（炭末、银粉等）。数家面粉制造业，在人民政府扶植下，改为机制面粉厂。新开张之瑞丰面粉厂，得到了一百万元（人民券）贷款，由天津购回一部钢滚磨面机。同聚粮栈最近改为面粉制造业，该栈原有资金八百万元，又从政府贷到二百万元，由天津购到三部钢滚磨面机，八月中旬即可开工生产。德茂升等三家石磨制面厂，亦正计划购买钢滚机。福利永、福恒泳合并经营，也计划改进机器设备。张市尚有不少私营磨面房，因受资本限制，一时不容易完全改用新式机器。该市德顺、聚生两铁工厂，为了协助这些磨面房在现有基础上，提高产品质量，现正赶造比较省钱的机制面粉机——钢板磨。德顺铁工厂已造出一部，万新成面粉厂试用后效果良好，每日可产面粉八百斤，较旧式钢板磨（日产量四百斤）效力提高一倍。此外该德顺铁工厂，现正设计创造新式铡草机与小型榨油机，以便各地采用。张市皮革制造业，也在力求改进技术，以便打开销路。　　　（吕光明）
