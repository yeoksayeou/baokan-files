　　Jizhong State-Owned Dongxing Store
  　Implements Trial Grain and Cloth Rationing to Guarantee Employee Livelihood
    [Jizhong Electric] The No. 1 branch of the state-owned Dongxing Store in Botou City has begun a trial implementation of "unified distribution of daily necessities for employees." All workers and salaried staff of public factories and their families are eligible for rationing. Grain is rationed at a rate of 1.5 jin per person per day, with prices 1% lower than listed prices; the actual selling price is the lower of the prices on the factory's pay day and the grain selling day. Employees can purchase grain at the store by presenting their grain purchase certificates. Other daily necessities are distributed through the workers' consumer cooperatives at prices 4% lower than wholesale prices for cloth and 5% lower for other items (10% lower than market retail prices). The initial supply is set at 1 jin of salt, 4 liang of alkali, 0.5 jin of kerosene, and 2 zhang 6 chi of cloth per person per month. Other daily necessities can be purchased according to need. Since the implementation of this method, the lives of employees have been further guaranteed, and the actual wages will not be affected by fluctuations in grain prices after payday. Currently, Yonghua Match Company and the Electric Light Company are among the five units that purchase grain directly from the store, with a total of 2,265 grain-consuming people (including 1,277 family members), purchasing approximately 100,090 jin of grain per month. On July 12th alone, female workers at Yonghua Match Company saved 23,700 yuan by buying 10,000 jin of grain compared to market prices. However, employees still find the purchasing procedures complicated, and both parties are continuing to negotiate improvements.

　　冀中国营东与商店
  　保障职工生活试办粮布配售
    【冀中电】国营东兴商店第一分店，在泊头市开始试办“职工生活必需品统筹配售”。凡各公营工厂的工人和薪金待遇的职员及其家属均可享受配售待遇。配售粮食时按每人每日一斤半计算，价格低于牌价百分之一；并根据工厂发薪日与卖粮日，两日的低价实售，职工持购粮证即可到商店购买。其他各项日用品，一律通过工人消费合作社配售，价格：布低于批发价格百分之四，其他低于百分之五（比市场零售价则低百分之十）。供给量，初步规定每人每月盐一斤、碱面四两、煤油半斤、布每人半年两丈六尺，其他日用品根据用量自行购买。此办法实行后，职工生活进一步得到保障，并可不致因发薪后引起粮价波动而影响实际工资。现在由商店直接购粮的就有永华火柴公司、电灯公司等五个单位，用粮人数为二千二百六十五人（内有家属一千二百七十七人），每月总购粮约十万零九千斤。仅七月十二日永华火柴公司的女工，买粮一万斤即比市价便宜二万三千七百元。但在购买手续上，职工们还感到复杂，双方正继续协商改进中。
