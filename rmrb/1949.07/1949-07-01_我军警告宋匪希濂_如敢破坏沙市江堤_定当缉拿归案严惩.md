Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 30th. Song Xilian, commander of the Kuomintang bandit army's Hunan-Hubei Pacification Zone, under the instruction of war criminal Bai Chongxi, is preparing to destroy the Yangtze River embankment near Shashi,妄图 attempting to use floods to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing. A spokesman for the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army issued a statement stating: The Shashi embankment is an important coastal defense construction protecting the lives and property of millions of people along the river. If bandit Song stubbornly refuses to repent and executes this order, destroying the embankment and causing a catastrophe for the people along the river, then no matter where this bandit flees to, even to the ends of the earth, our army will arrest him and severely punish him.
