Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd. In the past six months, Northeast China has carried out relatively extensive livestock disease prevention and control work, and has established some key counties for breeding draught animals, achieving considerable results. This is of great significance to the agricultural and economic construction of Northeast China. There are many seasonal livestock diseases in Northeast China every year, which greatly hinder the breeding of draught animals and affect farming. This year, more than 5% to 10% of draught animals in many areas were infected with diseases. Since the beginning of spring plowing, the Agricultural Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has been helping various regions to carry out emergency treatment, and has also widely carried out immunization injections, so that the disease mortality rate of draught animals has been relatively reduced. Up to now, a total of more than 700,000 draught animals have been vaccinated (excluding Inner Mongolia), accounting for more than 19% of the total number of draught animals, and more than 67% of the annual injection plan has been completed. The infection rate of vaccinated draught animals has been greatly reduced, and even if they are infected, they are easy to treat. In some areas on the southern side of the Greater Khingan Mountains, where the disease was severe in the past year, the incidence and mortality rates of livestock have been reduced by 90% compared with the past after the implementation of preventive vaccination this spring. In several logging areas in northern Manchuria, serious livestock diseases occurred in the livestock teams, which were an important transportation force. After vigorous emergency treatment, they have been basically eliminated. Since the beginning of spring plowing, there have also been many livestock diseases in Inner Mongolia and some areas of Heilongjiang and western Liaoning. After several months of emergency treatment, the spread has been largely stopped. Jilin, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang provinces have all established key counties this year to promote artificial insemination work in a relatively scientific manner, gain experience, and promote it to various regions. The key counties in Heilongjiang Province have completed basic work such as establishing livestock registers, quarantine, and issuing livestock licenses, and have adopted artificial insemination methods to carry out breeding work throughout the county. Some key counties in Jilin Province have also organized farmers to carry out scientific breeding of livestock. According to a survey conducted by the Northeast Administrative Committee in one province, the current natural breeding rate of draught animals is only about 10% on average. Among them, the breeding rate of major draught animals such as horses is only 3%, and cattle is 20%, while their average mortality rate reaches 7%. In this way, the actual increase in numbers is very small. In the past, Northeast China suffered years of destruction by the Kuomintang bandit army, and some areas suffered from poor feeding and inadequate protection, and the number of draught animals has decreased compared with before the Japanese surrender. At present, there are more than 4.4 million draught animals in the entire Northeast, of which only more than 3.5 million can actually be used. The cultivated land area in the entire Northeast is more than 170 million mu. If calculated on the basis of 40 to 50 mu of cultivated land per animal, it is extremely insufficient. Therefore, the Northeast Administrative Committee has decided that in the future, on the basis of protecting existing draught animals and strengthening their physical strength, it will carry out large-scale breeding, requiring that in the next two years, horses will increase by 100,000 annually and cattle will increase by 200,000 annually, and strictly prevent theft, slaughter of draught animals and losses due to disease and death. In addition to breeding draught animals, the Northeast Administrative Committee has also decided to greatly develop livestock and poultry, requiring that in the next two years, the number of pigs will be doubled from the existing 3 million, sheep will increase by 30% from the existing 900,000, dairy cows will increase by 30% on the basis of the existing 5,700, and chickens will increase to 60 million. At present, extensive publicity and education have been launched in various places to mobilize farmers to actively respond to the call of the People's Government.

### 东北加强畜产工作　将大量增殖猪鸡牛羊

　　东北加强畜产工作
  　将大量增殖猪鸡牛羊
    【新华社沈阳三日电】东北各地过去半年都比较广泛地进行了防治畜疫工作，并建立了一些繁殖耕畜的重点县，取得不少成绩，这对东北农业经济建设具有重要意义。东北地区每年季节性的畜疫甚多，障碍耕畜繁殖和影响耕作很大。今年不少地区有百分之五至百分之十以上的耕畜染疫。东北行政委员会农业部，自进入春耕以后，即帮助各地进行紧急抢治，同时广泛地进行了防疫注射，使耕畜的疾病死亡率相对减少。迄今为止，受防疫注射的耕畜共有七十余万头（内蒙的未计在内），占耕畜总数百分之十九以上，完成了全年注射计划的百分之六十七以上。被注射后的耕畜，染疫率大为减低，即使染疫，亦易医治。前年染疫严重的大兴安岭南侧若干地带，因今春实行预防注射后，牲畜染疫及死亡率都比过去减少百分之九十。在北满几个林木采伐区内，作为重要运输力量的畜力队，曾发生严重的畜疫，经大力抢治结果，现已基本上扑灭。内蒙及黑龙江、辽西某些地区，春耕以来畜疫亦多，经数月之紧急抢治，已大部停止蔓延。吉林、松江、黑龙江各省今年都设产了比较科学的推广配种工作的重点县，取得经验，向各地推广。黑龙江省的重点县已完成了建立畜籍、检疫、发牲畜执照等基本工作，并采取人工授精法，开展全县的配种工作。吉林省的有些重点县也曾组织农民进行了对牲畜科学配种。据东北行政委员会在一个省的调查证明：目前耕畜的自然繁殖率，平均仅约为百分之十左右。其中主要耕畜如马的繁殖率仅为百分之三，牛为百分之二十，而它们的平均死亡率却达百分之七。这样，生死对消，实际增加数字非常微小。东北过去因连年遭受国民党匪军的摧残，以及一些地区饲养不良保护不周，耕畜数量已比日本投降以前减少。现全东北的耕畜共有四百四十余万头，其中真正可供役使者只三百五十余万头。东北全境的耕地面积为一万七千余万亩，如以每头牲口耕地四十到五十亩计算，则极感不足。因此，东北行政委员会已决定今后要在保护现有耕畜，并加强其体力的基础上，大量进行繁殖，要求今后两年内，马每年增殖十万匹，牛每年增殖二十万头，并严防偷盗宰杀耕畜及疫病死亡等损失。除繁殖耕畜以外，东北行政委员会又决定大量发展家畜和家禽，要求在今后两年内，猪的数量比现有的三百万口增加一倍，羊比现有的九十万头增加百分之三十，奶牛在现有五千七百余头基础上增加百分之三十，鸡则增加到六千万只。目前各地已展开了广泛的宣传与教育，动员农民积极响应人民政府号召。
