The train from Beiping arrived on time and departed on time. The Tianjin-Pukou train departed from Tianjin on time, and the situation was good. The Beiping-Shanghai train only sells tickets south of Xuzhou, and because seats are assigned and not many tickets were sold in Beiping, it was not crowded. The Tianjin-Pukou train only sells tickets south of Jinan, and there were more passengers. In addition to ordinary passenger cars, these two trains also have soft-berth first and second-class cars, and the Beiping-Shanghai train also has sleeper cars.

　　平沪直达特快客车
  　昨由平出发返沪
    【本报讯】十二年来平沪首次直达特快客车于昨（十日）下午五时二十五分由北平东站开出。将于十二日下午三时抵达上海北站。平津路局的员工们，列队在月台上欢送，旅客们也满脸笑容，互庆平沪直达通车。以后每日下午五时二十五分及十一时平沪对开特快一次。首次列车挂有行李车二辆，三等客车五辆，二等、头等客车各一辆，二等、头等卧车各一辆，头等餐车一辆。机车为天津解放号。
    【本报天津专电】昨日为平沪、津浦间正式通车第一日，由平开来列车，准时到达，并准时开出。津浦车由津准时开出，情形良好。平沪通车只售徐州以南客票，因系对号入座，又因北平方面售票不多，故并不拥挤，津浦通车只售济南以南客票，旅客较多。这两次车，除普通客车外，都另加软席头二等车，平沪通车并加挂卧车。
