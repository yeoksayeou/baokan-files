Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 27th: TASS, Washington, July 26th: To urge Congress to quickly pass the military "aid" plan for Western Europe, the U.S. State Department issued and submitted to Congress a pamphlet attempting to justify the plan to build up armaments for Western European countries. Although U.S. officials have repeatedly stated that the North Atlantic Treaty and arms aid plan are not directed against the Soviet Union or any other country, the pamphlet frankly reveals the U.S. government's anti-Soviet and anti-communist policy, while also admitting that this armament plan is a means of helping to support the declining American economy. The pamphlet declares: The military aid plan stipulates integrating all U.S. military aid programs into a single plan, with a total appropriation of $1.45 billion in the first year (up to June 30, 1950), specifically allocated as follows: $940 million for military equipment, technology, and personnel training assistance to Western European signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty; $155 million to assist the military production of these countries; $300 million as military aid to non-signatory countries such as Greece, Turkey, Iran, South Korea, and the Philippines; $45 million as a fund for emergencies; and $10 million for administrative expenses. The pamphlet claims: One of the main purposes of the plan is to more closely coordinate military aid with other actions of U.S. foreign policy. The pamphlet declares: The plan also includes "technical and military training assistance," using American military experts to train military personnel from recipient countries, so that they understand how to use American-style equipment. The pamphlet also states that the political measures resulting from the European military aid plan will be determined by the Joint U.S. Foreign Military Assistance Committee. This committee includes the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the executor of the Marshall Plan.

　　美国务院发行小册子
  　附和杜鲁门滥调
    【新华社北平二十七日电】塔斯社华盛顿二十六日讯：美国国务院为了要求国会迅速通过军事“援助”西欧计划，发行并呈交国会一本小册子，企图为西欧国家建立军备的计划辩护。虽然美国官员再三申述北大西洋公约及军火援助计划并不是反对苏联或其他任何国家的，然而该小册子坦白地表明了美国政府反苏反共产主义的政策，同时承认这一军备计划是帮助支持正在衰落的美国经济的一种手段。小册子宣称：军事援助计划规定了把美国一切的军事援助方案溶合成单一的计划，其拨款总数在第一年度（至一九五零年六月三十日为止）为十四亿五千万美元，具体分配如下：九亿四千万元作为对北大西洋公约西欧签约国的军事设备、技术及人员训练的援助，一亿五千五百万元帮助这些国家的军事生产，三亿元作为对希腊、土耳其、伊朗、南朝鲜、菲律宾的非签约国的军事援助。四千五百万元作为紧急事变的基金，一千万元充作行政费用。该小册子声称：该计划主要目的之一，是把军事援助和美国外交政策的其他行动更密切地配合起来。该小册子宣称：该计划还包括“技术与军事训练的援助”，用美国的军事专家训练接受援助的国家的军事人员，使他们懂得怎样去应用美式配备。小册子又称：由于军事援欧计划而产生的政治措施，将由美国对外军事援助联合委员会来决定。该委员会包括国务卿、国防部长与马歇尔计划执行人。
