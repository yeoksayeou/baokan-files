The Ninth Day of the Literary Congress
    Qian Junrui Reports on the Soviet Literary and Art Circles' Struggle Against "Cosmopolitanism"

    [Our Newspaper] Yesterday (July 11th) was the ninth day of the National Literary Congress. Chaired by Hong Shen, the meeting continued with free speeches, and Comrade Qian Junrui was invited to give a report on "The Soviet Literary and Art Circles' Struggle Against 'Cosmopolitanism'."

    The literary writers Cao Yu, Chen Xue Zhao, Yang Hui, Zhong Jingwen, the musician Ma Sicong, the army literary workers Shi Le, Wang Dizi, and the folk art worker Lian Kuoru, among others, delivered free speeches.

    Before the meeting, General Chairman Guo Moruo reported the news of the death of democratic cultural figure Zhang Ximan, and read Mr. Zhang's last handwritten will and farewell poem. All representatives stood in silence to mourn Mr. Zhang's death.

    Then the representatives made free speeches. The first was the playwright Cao Yu, who hoped that literary workers would pay attention to four points: first, do not have a rigid attitude and be afraid to do anything; second, be wary of empty enthusiasm; third, find a progressive foundation and write step by step; and fourth, develop revolutionary literature and art, not only writing short works that are urgently needed at present, but also paying attention to reflecting the historical and comprehensive revolutionary process.

    The female writer Chen Xue Zhao, who went to the liberated areas in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, spoke, hoping that intellectuals would be determined to work hard to transform themselves and learn to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    After speeches by the literary professor Yang Hui, the writer Zhong Jingwen, who studies folk literature, and the musician Ma Sicong, the army literary workers Shi Lemeng and Wang Dizi spoke, talking about the soldiers' love for literature and art and literary workers, and hoping that after this conference, the representatives could go to the army in an organized manner to engage in literary work. After the folk art worker Lian Kuoru spoke, the conference invited Qian Junrui to report on "The Soviet Literary and Art Circles' Struggle Against 'Cosmopolitanism'."

    Qian Junrui first pointed out: "Cosmopolitanism" is a tool for American imperialism to attempt to implement world domination. Its purpose is to obliterate the independence and characteristics of all nations, and to weaken the self-confidence and self-esteem of all nations.

    Then, he used abundant materials to illustrate that in the Soviet cultural circles, especially in the literary and art circles, there also existed such reactionary "cosmopolitan" writers and their activities. They specifically opposed works reflecting the struggles and construction of the Soviet people with clear political goals and Soviet patriotism, advocated formalism, worshiped the decadent culture and art of the European and American bourgeoisie, and belittled the cultural and artistic traditions of the Russian nation and other Soviet nationalities.

    He continued: Since January of this year, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, the Soviet cultural and artistic circles have launched a struggle against this reactionary "cosmopolitan" thought, and the main figures who promoted this reactionary thought have been criticized and purged.

    Finally, he said: Imperialist cultural and artistic influences also exist in China. We should also be vigilant and oppose this influence, and love the Chinese people, Chinese history, and China's excellent cultural and artistic traditions, and create works of proletarian patriotism and proletarian internationalism.

    During the meeting, Wang Xiang and Li Ang, representatives of the National Railway Workers' Provisional Congress, attended and spoke. They unanimously pointed out that they are willing to guarantee that wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, the railway will be built there, under the leadership of Chairman Mao. At the same time, they hope that literary workers can also combine with them to ensure that wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, they will write and perform there.

　　文代大会第九日
    钱俊瑞报告苏联文艺界
  　反对“世界主义”的斗争
    【本报讯】昨天（十一日）全国文代大会第九日，洪深主席，会议继续自由发言，同时并请钱俊瑞同志作关于“苏联文艺界反对‘世界主义’的斗争”的报告。
    自由发言的有文艺作家曹禺、陈学昭、杨晦、钟敬文，音乐家马思聪，部队文艺工作者时乐、王地子，曲艺工作者连阔如等七人。
    开会前总主席郭沫若报告了民主文化人士张西曼病逝消息，并朗读了张先生临终前的亲笔遗嘱及谢世诗。全场代表起立为张先生的病逝默哀。
    接着代表自由发言，第一个是剧作家曹禺，他希望文艺工作者注意四点：第一是不要死不动的态度，什么也不敢作。第二对空泛的热情要警惕。第三要找到进步基础一步步去写作。第四要发展革命的文艺，不但要写当前迫切需要的短小作品，同时要注意反映有历史性的全面的革命过程。
    抗战初期到解放区的女作家陈学昭发言，希望知识分子下决心下苦功改造自己，学习为工农兵服务。
    在文艺教授杨晦、研究民间文艺的作家钟敬文和音乐家马思聪发言后，部队文艺工作者时乐蒙、王地子的发言中，谈到战士们对文艺与文艺工作者的热爱，希望在此次大会后，代表们能有组织的到部队中搞文艺工作。曲艺工作者连阔如发言以后，大会请钱俊瑞报告“苏联文艺界反对‘世界主义’的斗争”。
    钱俊瑞首先指出：“世界主义”是美帝国主义企图实行世界统治的工具，它的目的是为了抹煞各民族的独立和特点，削弱各民族的自信心和自尊心。
    接着他以丰富的材料说明在苏联文化界，特别是文艺界，也存在着这种反动的“世界主义”的作家及其活动。他们专门反对具有显明政治目标和苏维埃爱国主义的反映苏联人民斗争和建设的作品，鼓吹形式主义，崇拜欧美资产阶级的腐朽的文化和艺术，轻视俄罗斯民族与苏联其他各民族的文化艺术传统。
    他继续说：今年一月起，苏联文化界和文艺界在联共中央领导之下，展开了反对这种反动的“世界主义”思想的斗争，宣传这种反动思想的首要分子受到批评和清算。
    最后，他说：中国也存在着帝国主义的文化艺术的影响，我们也应该警惕，反对这种影响，并热爱中国人民，中国历史和中国优良的文化艺术传统，创造出无产阶级爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的作品来。
    会中并有全国铁路职工临代会代表王祥、李昂出席讲话。他们一致指出愿意在毛主席的领导下，保证人民解放军打到哪里，铁路就修到哪里。同时希望文艺工作者也能和他们结合起来，保证人民解放军打到哪里，就写到哪里，演到哪里。

    【又讯】中共中央西北局于七月七日，特电文代大会致贺。
