　　People's Bank of Xinji Office
　　Loans Support to Oil Mill Industry
    [Xinji News] In order to help the oil industry in Xinji City with its capital turnover, solve its raw material shortage, and ensure its expanded reproduction, the Xinji Office of the People's Bank of China recently loaned 640,000 yuan to ten oil mills. For example, Tianxing Oil Mill, with its small capital and scarce raw materials, could only continue to press oil for three or four more days before having to stop production. The office provided loan assistance to enable it to continue production. Since the beginning of June, the office has lent the mill 50,000 yuan in early June, 30,000 yuan in mid-June, and 70,000 yuan in early July. The manager of the mill, Ma Yutang, said happily, "If it weren't for the People's Bank's care for us, how could we have done this?" (Xinji Bank Office Business Section)
