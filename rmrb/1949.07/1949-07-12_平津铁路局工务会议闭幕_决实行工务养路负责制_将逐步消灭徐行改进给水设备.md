　　[Tianjin Dispatch] The Pingjin Railway Bureau convened an engineering conference in Tianjin on the 4th. More than 130 people participated, including military representatives, section chiefs, supervisors, foremen, and worker representatives from all ten engineering sections of the railway. The conference lasted six days and concluded on the 9th. In addition to responding to the call of Vice Minister of Railways Lü Zhengcao to "oppose laziness and strengthen track maintenance work," the conference decided to implement an engineering and track maintenance responsibility system throughout the railway. It also adopted the engineering work plan for the second half of the year. The plan stated that train speeds must meet the requirements stipulated by the Ministry of Railways, and efforts must be made to gradually eliminate slow speeds (except for "permanent slow speeds"), increase the number of trains, and exceed the needs estimated by the transportation department. The minimum water storage capacity of water supply stations should reach 50 tons, and all water supply facilities should be completed with frost protection. In addition, targets were set for bridge load capacity, roadbed width, and siding length, based on specific conditions. The conference also discussed how to lead track maintenance work areas (track teams) and the conditions for creating model work areas, striving to overcome the current shortcomings in engineering work. During the conference, all representatives visited and studied the Qinhuangdao Station, which has the best track maintenance work, on the 8th. The Railway Bureau presented the station's employees with a banner reading "Track Maintenance Pioneer" and a bonus of 100,000 yuan.

　　Note: According to the results of a thorough inspection conducted by the Engineering Department of the Bureau at the end of May, there are still serious shortcomings in the engineering work of the lines under the Pingjin Railway Bureau. For example, on the Ping-Sui Line, some bridge bolts are loose, the pressure beams are rotten, and many bridge openings are blocked. With the arrival of the rainy season, there is no guarantee for the lines and bridges. The roadbed between Zhousizhuang and Tianzhen is loose and uneven, the sleepers are poor, and there is only one bolt on the fishplate, requiring trains to shake and travel slowly. On the northern section of the Ping-Han Line, north of Zhuozhou, there are many old sleepers and a lack of ballast, and the steel rails are mostly arched, causing severe vibrations when passenger trains travel. Regarding water supply equipment, out of the 46 locations inspected, 16 have not been repaired and are providing temporary water supply. Some places also have water source problems, and there are serious water leaks at Fengtai Station and Tangshan Station. Since Vice Minister Lü of the Ministry of Railways issued the call for track maintenance last month, employees at various stations have generally begun to pay attention and have initially strengthened work such as cleaning ballast and rectifying roadbeds. The conclusion of this engineering conference will further advance track maintenance work.

　　平津铁路局工务会议闭幕
  　决实行工务养路负责制
    将逐步消灭徐行改进给水设备
    【天津电】平津铁路管理局四日在津召开工务会议，参加全路十个工务段的军事代表、段长、监工、工长及职工代表等共一百三十余人，历时六天，已于九日闭幕。会中除响应铁道部吕正操副部长“反对懒汉，加强养路工作”的号召，决定全路实行工务养路负责制外，并通过下半年的工务工作计划。该计划指出：在行车速度上必须达到铁道部规定的要求，同时逐步做到消灭徐行（“永久徐行”除外），增加列车对数，超过运输部门估计的需要。给水站的储水量最低要达到五十吨，并完成所有给水的防寒设备。此外，在桥梁荷量、路基宽度及侧线长度上，亦根据具体情况，分别规定了目标。会议并讨论了如何领导养路工区（道班）和作模范工区的条件，努力克服目前工务工作上存在着的缺点。又会议期间，全体代表曾于八日赴养路工作做得最好的秦皇岛站参观和学习，路局并赠予该站全体职工“养路先锋”锦旗一面，奖金十万元。
    按：据该局工务处五月底派员普遍深入视察结果，平津路局所属各线路在工务工作上还存有严重的缺点。如平绥线有的桥梁螺丝不紧，压梁木腐朽，很多桥洞已堵死，雨季到来，路线、桥梁都没有保障；周士庄、天镇间路基松软不平，枕木不好，鱼尾板上只一个螺丝钉，火车通过时须摇摆徐行；平汉北段涿县以北，旧枕木多，缺少石碴，钢轨多呈弓形，客车行驶时震动很厉害。在给水设备方面，所视察的四十六处中，有十六处还没修复，而是临时供水，有的地方水源也成问题，丰台站、唐山站都有严重的漏水现象。自铁道部吕副部长在上月发出养路号召后，各站段职工一般已开始重视，初步加强了清理道碴、整顿道床等工作。此次工务会议闭幕后，将使养路工作更向前推进一步。
