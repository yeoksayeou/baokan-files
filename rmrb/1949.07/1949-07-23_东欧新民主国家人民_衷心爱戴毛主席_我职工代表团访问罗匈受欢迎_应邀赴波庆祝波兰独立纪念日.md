Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 22nd: The Chinese delegation, which was prevented from attending the Second World Trade Union Congress (formerly translated as the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress) in Milan due to obstruction by the Italian reactionary government, visited the fraternal trade unions of Hungary and Romania from the 1st to the 19th of this month. They observed the vigorous new democratic economic construction of the two countries and departed Romania on the 19th for Poland for a visit.

During the delegation's ten days in Hungary, they visited various industrial sectors. Everywhere the delegation went, from airports and train stations to factories, there were large portraits of Chairman Mao and Chinese slogans such as "Salute the heroic Chinese people." At numerous welcoming rallies and forums, many leaders of the Hungarian Workers' Party and government attended and spoke. On the 5th of this month, the General Secretary of the Hungarian Workers' Party and Prime Minister of Hungary, Rákosi, in spite of his busy schedule, also met with the head of the delegation, Liu Ningyi, and others. He earnestly spoke about the important experiences of the Hungarian people in national construction with the help of the Soviet Union in recent years and expressed hope that China and Hungary would promote cultural and economic exchanges to enhance the friendship between the two peoples in the future.

On the 11th, the delegation traveled from Hungary to Romania by special train. As they entered the territory of the Romanian People's Republic amidst the singing of the Internationale by welcomers, they were greeted by a huge portrait of Chairman Mao and a flag of the Chinese People's Liberation Army flying in the wind. This was made by Romanian workers based on English broadcasts from the New China News Agency. In Romania, the delegation heard special reports from trade union officials on trade union activities and collective contracts, and visited the world-renowned Ploiești oil fields and other enterprises. The chairman of the Constanța City Trade Union on the Black Sea, upon meeting the Chinese delegation visiting the city, said: "I have carefully read Comrade Mao Zedong's essay 'On the People's Democratic Dictatorship,' and I am extremely excited!" On the 13th, Romanian Prime Minister Dr. Groza received the delegation. He said that it was a great pleasure to meet the children of the great Chinese people. At a conference of trade union activists convened by the Central Committee of the Romanian Trade Unions on the 15th, the head of the Chinese delegation, Liu Ningyi, was invited to speak and introduce the situation of the Chinese people's liberation struggle. He emphasized that this was a victory for internationalism and quoted Chairman Mao, stating that without the existence of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and without the help of the working class and progressive people of the world, China's revolution would not have achieved such a victory today. The conference then passed a resolution amidst prolonged cheers, congratulating the victory of the Chinese people. After visiting Hungary and Romania, the delegation continued to Poland at the invitation of the Polish Trade Unions and arrived in Warsaw from Bucharest on the 21st. When interviewed by a reporter from the Polish News Agency, the head of the delegation, Liu Ningyi, said that they were here to participate in the celebration of Polish Independence Day. We represent all Chinese trade unions in extending congratulations to the Polish trade union workers and wishing Poland success in building socialism. The Chinese delegation participated in the National Day celebration in Warsaw. The delegation will stay in Poland for ten days and will visit the worker districts of Łódź, Poznań, Katowice, and Wrocław.

　　东欧新民主国家人民
    衷心爱戴毛主席
    我职工代表团访问罗匈受欢迎
    应邀赴波庆祝波兰独立纪念日
    【新华社布拉格二十二日电】因意大利反动政府阻挠而未能前往米兰参加世界工联第二次世界职工会代表大会（前译世界工联代表大会）的中国代表团，自本月一日到十九日，曾先后访问了匈牙利和罗马尼亚两国的兄弟职工会，参观了两国蓬勃的新民主主义经济建设，并于十九日自罗匈波兰参观。
    代表团在匈牙利的十天中，参观了各种企业部门。代表团所到之处，从飞机场、车站到工厂，都有大幅毛主席画像和“向英勇的中国人民致敬”的中文标语。在多次的欢迎会和座谈会上，匈牙利的工人党和政府的许多的领袖都曾出席讲话。匈工人党总书记、匈总理拉科西本月五日亦在百忙中召见代表团团长刘宁一等，恳切地讲述了近几年来匈牙利人民在苏联帮助之下进行国家建设的重要经验，并希望今后中匈两国促进文化经济交流，以增进两国人民的友谊。
    代表团十一日由匈乘专车赴罗，当他们在欢迎者高唱国际歌声中进入罗马尼亚人民民主共和国的国土时，迎面就见到巨幅的毛主席画像，并有一面中国人民解放军的军旗在迎风飘扬。这是罗马尼亚的工人们依照新华社英文广播设制的。代表团在罗马尼亚听取了职工会负责人关于工会活动和集体合同等的专题报告，并参观了全世界闻名的普洛业什特油田区和其他企业。黑海边上的康斯坦萨城职工会主席和访问该城的中国代表团刚见面时首先就说：“我仔细读了毛泽东同志的‘论人民民主专政’的论文，真是兴奋极了！”十三日，罗马尼亚总理格罗查博士接见代表团。他说能和伟大的中国人民的儿女相见，是十分愉快的事。在罗职工会中央委员会十五日召开的工会活动分子大会上，中国代表团团长刘宁一被邀讲话，介绍中国人民解放斗争的情况。他强调指出，这是国际主义的胜利，并引毛主席的话，说明没有苏联和新民主主义国家的存在，没有全世界工人阶级与进步人民的帮助，中国的革命就不会有今天这样的胜利。大会随即在长久的欢呼声中通过致电祝贺中国人民的胜利。代表团在访问匈罗两国后，续应波兰职工会的邀请，已于二十一日由布加勒斯特抵华沙。代表团团长刘宁一于接见波兰通讯社记者时称，我们是来参加波兰独立纪念日的庆祝的。我们代表中国所有的职工会向波兰的职工会工作者致贺，并祝波兰建设社会主义成功。中国代表团在华沙参加了国庆日纪念会。代表团将在波兰迳留十天，并将访问罗兹、波斯南、卡托维兹与罗克劳的工人区。
