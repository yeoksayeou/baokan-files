　　To Facilitate Urban-Rural Trade
  　Two Bridges Completed on the Wei River
    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] The two steel girder bridges in Linqing and Nanguantao Towns in the Jinnan District, which are crucial for material transportation, were successfully completed ahead of schedule on June 25th. The Ping (Beiping) - Kai (feng) Highway passes through the Wei River in Linqing City and Nanguantao. Linqing City is a material distribution center in the Jinnan District, but due to the absence of a bridge over the river, transportation was inconvenient, causing many difficulties for urban-rural trade. To address this, the North China People's Government specifically decided that the North China Highway Bureau and local governments would construct two steel girder bridges and allocated 1.1 million jin of millet to assist. The project began on May 17th. The bridge construction workers and the 8,000 farmers who participated in the project worked extremely hard and finally managed to complete the task ahead of schedule before "July 1st." The Linqing bridge is 106 meters long and 10 meters high. The Nanguantao bridge is 108 meters long and 7 meters high. Both bridges have a load capacity of 15 metric tons, requiring a total of 18,000 man-days, over 3,000 fir timbers, and seven tons of iron. The warranty period is 15 to 20 years. To celebrate their construction victory, the local government and people named the Linqing steel girder bridge "Victory Bridge" and the Nanguantao steel girder bridge "July 1st" Bridge.

    【本报讯】关系物资运输颇大的冀南区临清、南馆陶镇两钢梁桥，于六月二十五日先后胜利提前落成。平（北平）开（封）公路在临清市、南馆陶穿过卫河。临清市为冀南区物资集散地，但因河上无桥，交通不便，城乡贸易诸多困难。为此，华北人民政府特决定华北公路总局及当地政府修筑两钢梁桥，并拨小米一百一十万斤协助。工程于五月十七日开始，修桥职工及参加这一工程的八千农民均极为努力，终于争取在“七一”前胜利提前完成了任务。临清桥长一○六公尺，高十公尺。南馆陶桥长一○八公尺，高七公尺。两桥载重均为十五公吨，共用人工一万八千个，柏木三千余根，铁七吨，保险期为十五年到二十年。当地政府及人民为了庆祝他们建设上的胜利，把临清钢梁桥命名为“胜利桥”；南馆陶钢梁桥命名为“七一”桥。
