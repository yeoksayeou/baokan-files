　　Introduction to Several Historical Figures
    Peng Ming
    Chairman Mao once mentioned in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Since the defeat in the Opium War in 1840, advanced Chinese people have gone through untold hardships to seek truth from Western countries. Hong Xiuquan, Kang Youwei, Yan Fu, and Sun Yat-sen represented the figures who sought truth from the West before the birth of the Chinese Communist Party."

    Here, based on the reference materials at hand, I will make a simple note on the deeds of Hong, Kang, and Yan as a reference for study.
    I. Hong Xiuquan
    Hong Xiuquan was born in Huaxian County, Guangdong Province, in 1812 (the 17th year of the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty). His parents and brothers made a living by farming, and his family was poor. Xiuquan entered a private school at the age of seven (1819). He was exceptionally intelligent. In five or six years, he became proficient in the Four Books, Five Classics, Classic of Filial Piety, and many ancient essays. His parents, brothers, and relatives all hoped that he would become famous through the imperial examinations. At the age of sixteen, he dropped out of school due to poverty and helped his parents and brothers farm. At the age of eighteen, he was hired as a teacher in the village school.

    Around 1807, the British Missionary Society sent Morrison to Guangzhou to preach and translate the Christian Bible into Chinese. His first disciple, Liang Afa, wrote a kind of preaching book called "Good Words to Admonish the World," which he distributed and preached on the road. In 1837 (the 17th year of the Daoguang reign), Hong Xiuquan, at the age of twenty-five, went to Guangzhou to take the imperial examinations, and unintentionally obtained "Good Words to Admonish the World." Because Xiuquan was frustrated in the examination hall, it aroused his rebellious thoughts. After the examination, he returned home and feigned illness for more than forty days, saying that he had gone to heaven and received God's mandate.

    In 1838 and 1843, Xiuquan failed the examination twice. At that time, the Opium War broke out, and the corruption of the Manchu Qing dynasty's politics and military was fully exposed in the war. Xiuquan decided to abandon the imperial examinations and prepare for the uprising. In 1843, he and his classmate Feng Yunshan studied "Good Words to Admonish the World" and founded the God-Worshipping Society. In 1844, Xiuquan and Yunshan went to Guangxi to preach. In 1845, Xiuquan created "Ode to the Original Way to Save the World," "Treatise on Awakening the World to the Original Way," and "Instructions on Making the World Aware of the Original Way" to promote ideas of political equality, economic equality, and national equality, laying the ideological foundation for the Taiping Revolution.

    The Taiping Revolution began in 1850 and failed in 1864. Xiuquan committed suicide by poisoning himself, lasting a total of fifteen years. The revolutionary area: extending from Guangdong and Guangxi in the south, to Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the east, to Shaanxi and Gansu in the west, and near Tianjin in the north, covering seventeen provinces. The revolutionary forces were peasants, handicraftsmen, poor people, and impoverished intellectuals; a small number of Han landlords also participated. The aim of the revolution was to overthrow Manchu oppression and feudal exploitation. Therefore, it is said that the Taiping Revolution opened the prelude to the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution. Marx and Engels said in 1850 that if the Chinese revolution succeeded, a "Republic of China" with "liberty, equality, and fraternity" would emerge, which would have a very significant result for world civilization and would prevent the reactionary forces in Europe from extending to Asia. However, at that time, China did not yet possess all the conditions for capitalist development and was still in a feudal society, without a bourgeoisie or proletariat. Therefore, the Taiping Revolution was still a peasant war. The peasants suffered from the oppression of the landlord class and had revolutionary enthusiasm; on the other hand, the peasants still had narrow, conservative, scattered, and private negative factors. It has been proven by many historical facts that peasants can heavily strike at feudal forces, but they cannot fundamentally overthrow the feudal system. Peasants can only achieve victory under the leadership of the bourgeoisie (as in the French Revolution of 1789) or the proletariat (as in the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Chinese New Democratic Revolution), and peasants can only achieve complete liberation under the leadership of the proletariat. Due to this historical limitation, although the Taiping Revolution heavily struck the feudal rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, it could not unite other revolutionary forces; internal strife occurred between Yang and Wei, causing division; and some utopian and conservative errors were made in policy and strategy; as a result, the vigorous revolutionary movement was eventually strangled by the Manchu Qing nobles, traitorous landlords, and foreign aggressors.

    II. Kang Youwei
    In 1895 (the 21st year of the Guangxu reign), in the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, the Chinese army and navy suffered a complete and tragic defeat, and Li Hongzhang's "Westernization Movement" completely failed. Foreign aggressors not only openly advocated in their words but also actively carried out the "carving up of the Qing Empire" in their actions. This stimulated a part of the Manchu and Han ruling class and intellectuals contaminated with capitalist ideas, demanding to unite to resist foreign aggression, resulting in a reformist movement to preserve the race in politics.

    The advocates of the reform movement at that time, such as Emperor Guangxu, Weng Tonghe, Zhang Jian, Kang Youwei, Tan Sitong, and Liang Qichao, although different in their thinking, were generally semi-feudal and semi-capitalist figures.

    Kang Youwei was born in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, in 1856 (the sixth year of the Xianfeng reign). His family was a bureaucratic gentry. In his childhood, he received strict Cheng-Zhu school education, and readily used the words “sage, sage.” In his youth, he had a thorough understanding of the modern text of Confucian classics, Chinese history, and Buddhism. In middle age, he went to Beijing to take the examination. On the way passing through Hong Kong and Shanghai, he “saw the integrity of Western colonial politics, and the progress of the mainland could be known from its territories. Because of this, he thought that its basis must be in morality and knowledge" (Liang Qichao: "Biography of Mr. Kang of Nanhai"). In 1891 (the 17th year of the Guangxu reign), he began to gather students and give lectures in Guangzhou's Wanmu Caotang. His purpose of lecturing was "to take Confucianism, Buddhism, and the learning of the Song and Ming dynasties as the core, and to use history and Western learning. When discussing a subject or an event, he would always go through the past and present to study its evolution and gains and losses, and also introduce Europe and the United States to compare and prove it" (ibid.).

    Kang Youwei lectured for four years, cultivating the foundation of the reformist school. Chen Qianqiu and Liang Qichao were his great disciples, and they helped him write "The Book of Great Unity," "A Study of the Forged Classics of the New School," and "Confucius' Reform," completing the theoretical basis of the reform movement. Among them, the most important work is "The Book of Great Unity," which mixed the Three Ages Theory of the Gongyang School, the Xiaokang and Datong theories of the "Li Yun" chapter, the Buddhist theory of compassion and equality, Rousseau's theory of natural human rights, the Christian theory of love, equality, and freedom, and also digested some European socialist theories, fantasizing about a "world of great unity." The whole book is divided into ten parts, totaling hundreds of thousands of words. The general idea is that feudal society is a turbulent world, capitalist society is a peaceful (Xiaokang) world, and communist society is a Taiping (Datong) world. He described a "world of great unity where the world is for all, with no classes and complete equality" as a "paradise," showing rich imagination. But how to achieve this goal, he was helpless, as Chairman Mao said: "He did not and could not find a way to reach Datong." Due to class limitations (Kang Liang at that time represented the demands of enlightened landlords and wealthy merchants to transform into capitalists), he did not dare to face the class struggle squarely. "The Book of Great Unity" falsely constructs a special Chinese theory, affirming that "there are absolutely no classes in China, compared to the suffering of dividing races and levels in India and Europe, its happiness of equality and freedom is like paradise compared to hell." According to him, there are no classes in China, so naturally there will be no class struggle. The "paradise" can be reached through reform. "The Book of Great Unity" was regarded as a classic by the Chinese bourgeoisie, who shouted "the world is for all" in words, but in reality, it erased the existence of classes, fantasizing about the permanent prosperity of the bourgeoisie.

    In 1895 (the 21st year of the Guangxu reign), Kang Youwei called on more than 1,300 candidates in the Beijing examination to jointly petition the emperor, proposing reforms. In April 1898, Kang Youwei established the Society for the Preservation of the Nation in Beijing, with the purpose of preserving the nation, the race, and the teaching. Some enlightened bureaucrats also came to participate. On June 11 (April 23 of the Wuxu year), Emperor Guangxu issued an edict for reform, ordering Kang Youwei and others to participate in the government. As soon as the reform began, the die-hard faction headed by the Empress Dowager Cixi prepared to counterattack. The reformists obtained the power to issue orders, while the die-hard faction seized the real power of the military and government.

    After the reform, the Empress Dowager appointed the die-hard Ronglu as the Governor-General of Zhili, ordering him to command the troops stationed near Beijing, including Dong Fuxiang, Nie Shicheng, and Yuan Shikai. After that, the die-hard faction gathered crowds to disperse societies, destroy schools, beat up newspaper editors, and obstructed the reform in every way, and prepared to launch a coup in late October. Yuan Shikai of the Westernization faction expressed support for the reform at the time, and the reformists believed him. In September, due to the urgency of the situation, the reformists summoned Yuan Shikai to Beijing, promoted him to Vice Minister, and ordered him to kill the partisans and restore imperial power. On the 18th, Yuan Shikai superficially accepted the reformists' plan, and on the 20th, he informed Ronglu. Ronglu immediately reported to the Empress Dowager. That night, the Empress Dowager imprisoned Emperor Guangxu. Immediately afterward, she announced the abolition of all new policies and the restoration of all old systems. After the failure of the reform, Tan Sitong and others were killed, dozens of people were convicted, and Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and others fled to Japan one after another.

    The failure of the Wuxu Coup proved that it was impossible to transform China from top to bottom using reformism. After that, the reformists split: a few people continued to move forward and participated in the revolutionary activities of Sun Yat-sen and others; most people, such as Kang Liang, gradually degenerated into reactionary groups and became royalists. In 1927, Kang Youwei died in Qingdao.

    III. Yan Fu
    Yan Fu was born in Houguan County, Fujian Province, in 1862 (the first year of the Tongzhi reign). He was the first student of the Fujian Shipyard Academy. In 1876 (the second year of the Guangxu reign), he was sent to study naval affairs in Britain. In 1880 (the sixth year of the Guangxu reign), he served as the chief instructor of the Tianjin Naval Academy for twenty years, with many students. In 1897 (the 23rd year of the Guangxu reign), he published "Guowen Bao" (a ten-day publication) in Tianjin, translating and publishing important foreign political events and masterpieces. The translation of Huxley's "Evolution and Ethics," was published in this newspaper on a regular basis. After the Sino-Japanese War, immediately followed by the snatching of seaports by various countries, the stimulus to the Chinese people was too deep. "Evolution and Ethics" expounded the "law of the jungle, survival of the fittest," and "the principle of preserving the race, preserving the group, strengthening oneself, and advancing," pointing out new hopes for pessimistic and disappointed people. "Evolution and Ethics" was popular throughout the country and was called "the best Chinese translation, no book is better than this." It played a great role in the reform movement. At that time, Shanghai's "Shiwu Bao" and Tianjin's "Guowen Bao" took charge of the leadership position in the north and south of the public opinion circle. Yan Fu's influence was no less than Liang Qichao's.

    Yan Fu represented conservative people who did not want to see the country perish but lacked courage. He translated many books, and his writing style was ancient and obscure. He claimed, "My translation is not for schoolchildren, but for those who have read many ancient Chinese books," which is a manifestation of conservative thinking. On the one hand, he hated autocratic politics, and on the other hand, he worshiped autocratic emperors, advocating "the emperor and the people governing together." In the "Ten Thousand Words Letter to the Emperor," he did not dare to propose civil rights, but only asked to "unite the hearts of the people." The reform he spoke of was actually enlightened despotism. After the failure of Kang Liang, Yan Fu was not pursued by the die-hard faction, which was not accidental. In the early years of the Republic of China, Yan Fu served as the president of Peking University, and devoted himself to translation and narration.

    In addition to the aforementioned "Evolution and Ethics," Yan Fu's translations also included the British classical economist Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations," the French bourgeois political thinker Montesquieu's "The Spirit of the Laws," and the Englishman Muller's "Logic," which described formal logic. In addition, several books on sociology were translated. These, plus the natural sciences at the time, were the so-called new learning before the May Fourth Movement. This new learning served the old Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution, and played a progressive role in the struggle with the feudal class's old learning. However, due to the strength of Chinese feudal forces and the development of world capitalism to the era of imperialism, this new learning was quickly defeated by the enslaved ideology of foreign imperialism and the retrogressive thinking of Chinese feudalism.

　　关于几个历史人物的介绍
    彭明
    毛主席在“论人民民主专政”一文中，曾经提到：“自从一八四○年鸦片战争失败那时起，先进的中国人，经过千辛万苦，向西方国家寻找真理。洪秀全、康有为、严复和孙中山，代表了在中国共产党出世以前向西方寻找真理的一派人物。”
    这里谨就手头的几本参考材料，将洪、康、严三人的事迹，作一简单的笔记，以作为学习上的参考。
    一、洪秀全
    洪秀全，广东花县人，一八一二年（清嘉庆十七年）生。父兄耕田谋生，家境穷困。秀全七岁（一八一九年）入塾读书，聪明异常，五六年间，熟读四书、五经、孝经及古文多篇，父兄和亲族都希望他科举成名。十六岁因家贫失学，助父兄耕田，十八岁受聘为本村塾师。
    在一八○七的时候，英国传道会派遣玛礼逊到广州传教，译耶教圣经成华文。他的第一信徒梁亚发著一种传道书叫做“劝世良言”，在路上分发宣讲。一八三七年（道光十七年），洪秀全二十五岁，到广州应秀才考试，无意中得“劝世良言”，秀全因在科场失意，激起反抗思想，试罢归家，装疯病四十余日，说自己上天堂受了上帝的天命。
    一八三八、一八四三年，秀全两次考试，又遭失败。那时正值鸦片战争爆发，满清政治军事的腐败，在战争中完全暴露，秀全决心抛弃科举。实行起义准备。一八四三年他和同窗冯云山等研究“劝世良言”，创立上帝教。一八四四年，秀全、云山等到广西传教，一八四五年，秀全制作“原道救世歌”、“原道醒世论”、“原道觉世训”，宣传政治平等、经济平等、民族平等的思想，奠定了太平革命的思想基础。
    太平革命从一八五○年开始，到一八六四年失败，秀全服毒自杀，前后共十五年。革命区域：南起两广，东至江浙，西达陕甘，北到天津附近，普及十七省。革命的力量是农民、手工业者、贫民、穷苦的知识分子；也有一小部分的汉族地主参加。革命的目的是要推翻满族压迫和封建剥削，所以说太平革命是揭开了中国资产阶级民主革命的序幕，马克思、恩格斯在一八五○年时就说过，如果中国革命成功，就要出现“自由、平等、博爱”的“中华共和国”，这对世界文明定有非常重大的结果，会阻止欧洲反动势力向亚洲伸张。但是当时中国还没有具备资本主义发展的一切条件，还处在封建社会中，还没有形成资产阶级和无产阶级。所以太平革命仍是农民战争，农民身受地主阶级的压迫，有着革命的积极性；另方面农民还存在着狭隘的、保守的、散漫的、私有的消极因素。农民能够沉重的打击封建势力，但却不能从根本上推翻封建制度，这已经为许多历史事实所证明的了。农民要取得胜利，必须在资产阶级（如在一七八九年的法国革命）或无产阶级（如在一九一七年的俄国革命，以及中国的新民主主义革命）领导下才有可能，而农民要取得彻底的解放，则只有在无产阶级领导下才能达到。由于这一历史条件的限制，太平革命虽然沉重的打击了满清的封建统治，但是因为不能团结其他革命力量；内部发生杨韦内讧，彼此分裂；政策上战略上又犯了一些空想和保守的错误；以致轰轰烈烈的革命运动，终被满清贵族、汉奸大地主，联合外国侵略者所绞杀了。
    二、康有为
    一八九五年（光绪二十一年），中日甲午战争，中国海陆军遭受彻底的惨败，李鸿章的“洋务运动”全部破产。外国侵略者不仅在言论上公开主张，而且在行动上积极进行“瓜分大清帝国”，这刺激了一部分满汉统治阶级及染有资本主义思想的知识分子，要求联合起来抵御外侮，在政治上产生改良主义的保种运动。
    当时改良运动倡导者，如光绪帝、翁同和、张謇、康有为、谭嗣同、梁启超等人，虽然思想上各有不同，但一般来说，都是半封建半资本主义的人物。
    康有为，广东南海县人，一八五六年（咸丰六年）生，家庭是个官僚豪绅成份。幼年受严格的程朱学教育，开口便称“圣人，圣人”。青年时期，博通今文经学、中国史学及佛学。中年到北京应考，路过香港上海，“见西人植民政治之完整，属地如此，本国之更进可知，因思其所以致此者，必有道德学问以为之本原”（梁启超：“南海康先生传”）。一八九一年（光绪十七年），在广州万木草堂开始聚徒讲学。他的讲学宗旨是“以孔学、佛学、宋明学为体，以史学、西学为用。论一学、论一事必上下古今，以究其沿革得失，又引欧美以比较证明之”（同上）。
    康有为讲学凡四年，培植维新派的基础，陈千秋、梁启超都是他的大弟子，并且帮助他著“大同书”、“新学伪经考”、“孔子改制考”，完成了维新运动的理论根据。其中最主要的著作是“大同书”，他混合了公羊家三世说、“礼运篇”小康大同说、佛教慈悲平等说、卢骚天赋人权说、耶教博爱平等自由说，还耳食一些欧洲社会主义学说，幻想出一个“大同之世”。全书分十部，共数十万言。大意说封建社会是据乱世，资本主义社会是升平（小康）世，公产主义社会是太平（大同）世。他描述“大同之世，天下为公，无有阶级，一切平等”的“极乐世界”，表现出丰富的想象力。但是如何达到这个目的，他却是毫无办法，正如毛主席所说：“他没有也不可能找到一条到达大同的路”。由于受了阶级的限制（康梁当时代表开明的地主富商转化为资本家的要求），他不敢正视阶级斗争。“大同书”妄构中国特殊说，肯定“全中国绝无阶级，以视印度欧洲辨族分级之苦，其平等自由之乐，有若天堂之视地狱为”。照他的说法，中国并无阶级存在，自然不会有阶级斗争，用改良方法可以达到“极乐世界”。“大同书”被中国资产阶级奉为经典，口头高叫“天下为公”，实际是抹煞阶级存在，幻想资产阶级的永久繁盛。
    一八九五年（光绪二十一年），康有为号召在北京会试的举人一千三百余人，联名给皇帝上书，提出变法主张。一八九八年四月，康有为在北京成立保国会，以保国、保种、保教为宗旨，一些开明的官僚也来参加。六月十一日（戊戌年四月二十三日），光绪帝下诏变法，命康有为等参与政权。变法一开始，以西太后为首的顽固派就准备反攻，改良派取得发布命令权，顽固派则抓取军政实权。
    变法以后，西太后用顽固派的荣禄为直隶总督，命他统率驻扎北京附近的董福祥、聂士成、袁世凯等军。此后，顽固派聚众哄散学会，捣毁学堂，殴打报馆主笔，处处阻碍变法，并准备在十月底举行政变。洋务派的袁世凯，当时表示拥护变法，改良派信以为真。九月，改良派因形势紧急，召袁世凯入京，升他为侍郎，命他诛戮后党，恢复帝权。十八日，袁世凯表面接受改良派的计划，二十日，向荣禄告密。荣禄立刻报告西太后。当日夜间，西太后囚禁光绪帝。随即宣布废止全部新政，恢复全部旧制。变法失败以后，谭嗣同等六人被杀，数十人获罪，康有为、梁启超等先后逃往日本。
    戊戌政变的失败，证明用改良主义的方法，自上而下的改造中国是不可能的。此后改良派发生分化：少数人继续前进，参加孙中山等人的革命活动；康梁等多数人，则逐渐堕落为反动集团，成为保皇党。一九二七年，康有为死于青岛。
    三、严复
    严复，福建候官县人，一八六二年（同治元年）生。是福建船政学堂的第一期学生。一八七六年（光绪二年），被派赴英国学海军。一八八○年（光绪六年），任天津水师学堂总教习，前后二十年，拥有很多学生。一八九七年（光绪二十三年），在天津出版“国闻报”（旬刊）译载外国重要政事及名著，吓胥黎所著“天演论”的译文，就是在这个报上按期发表。甲午战后，紧接着各国强夺海口，对中国人的刺激是太深了，“天演论”阐发“弱肉强食，适者生存”，“保种保群自强进化之公理”，给悲观失望的人士指出新希望。“天演论”风行全国，被称为“中译之善本无有过于此书者”，在维新运动中起了极大的作用。当时上海“时务报”，天津“国闻报”，分掌南北舆论界领导地位，严复思想的影响不下于梁启超。
    严复代表不愿亡国但缺乏勇气的保守派人士。他译书多种，文字古奥，自称“吾译非以饷学童，正以待多读中国古书之人”，这正是保守思想的表现。他一面痛恨专制政治，一面又崇拜专制皇帝，主张“君与民共治”。在“上皇帝万言书”里，不敢提出民权，止请“结百姓之心”。他所说的维新，实际是开明专制。康梁失败后，严复并不被顽固派追究，这不是偶然的。民国初年，严复任京师大学校长，即专门从事译述。
    严复译述，除上述的“天演论”外，尚有英国古典经济学家亚丹斯密斯的“原富”，法国资产阶级政治思想家孟德斯鸠的“法意”，英人穆勒讲述形式逻辑的“名学”。此外，还译有社会学书籍数种。这些，再加上当时的自然科学，就是五四以前的所谓新学。这种新学是为旧时期的中国资产阶级民主革命服务的，在与封建阶级的旧学斗争中，曾起了进步作用。可是由于中国封建势力的强固，与世界资本主义已发展到帝国主义时代，这种新学很快就被外国帝国主义的奴化思想与中国封建主义的复古思想所打败了。
