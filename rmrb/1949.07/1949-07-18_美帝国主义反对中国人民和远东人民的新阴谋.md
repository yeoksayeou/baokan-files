    New Conspiracy of US Imperialism Against the Chinese People and the People of the Far East
    Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek and Philippine President Quirino held a secret meeting, after which they issued a so-called joint statement, claiming that "the two countries should immediately take concrete and practical steps to promote closer economic and cultural cooperation"; and advocated that the so-called Far Eastern countries "should immediately form an alliance to help each other to resist and eliminate the threat of communism." According to various sources, Chiang and Quirino are attempting to form a so-called "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance," gathering the South Korean puppet Syngman Rhee to form the "core" of this "alliance," and to win over the reactionaries of other Far Eastern countries to participate, even wanting to include Japanese reactionaries in this "alliance."
    Chiang Kai-shek, Quirino, and Syngman Rhee are all agents of US imperialism. This meeting between Chiang and Quirino and their ongoing new conspiracy are obviously planned by US imperialism. US State Department spokesman McDermott stated on the 11th that he had "great sympathy" for Chiang and Quirino's actions. US imperialists are plotting to organize the so-called "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance" in order to use this less blatant method, through the hands of puppets such as Quirino, to help the Kuomintang remnants make a desperate struggle. Because US imperialism has seen that the Kuomintang remnants will soon be wiped out from mainland China by the People's Liberation Army, and the tens of billions of US dollars it invested to enslave the Chinese people have almost been completely lost. US imperialism is by no means willing to accept this failure. This meeting between Chiang and Quirino and the so-called "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance" being planned are new tricks of US imperialism to continue to aid the Kuomintang bandits and oppose the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people. At the same time, this sinful act is not only against the Chinese people, but also against the people of the Philippines, Korea, Japan, and other countries in the Far East. US imperialism and its lackeys, in view of its failure in China, in view of the fact that the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has greatly encouraged the liberation struggles of the people of various countries in the Far East, and in view of the fact that the political consciousness of the people of various countries in the Far East is increasing day by day, are conspiring to unite the reactionaries of various countries in the form of an "alliance," in order to suppress the Far Eastern people's liberation movement and make the Far Eastern countries permanently沦为colonies of US imperialism.
    The people of China, the Philippines, Korea, and other countries in the Far East must heighten their vigilance, further unite, and resolutely struggle together against this criminal plan against the people of the Far East. There is no doubt that as long as the people of the Far East unite and fight, any conspiracy of US imperialism and its lackeys will certainly be crushed. In fact, in today's upsurge of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Chinese and Far Eastern peoples, even the reactionary camp cannot but admit its inevitable failure with regard to this so-called "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance." This is the reason why the US government and other colonial governments deliberately pretend not to participate in this farce. The strength of the Chinese people and the people of various countries in the Far East has become unprecedentedly strong. Chiang Kai-shek has been defeated, and the likes of Quirino, Syngman Rhee, and Yoshida are all in unfavorable situations. "Clay Bodhisattvas crossing the river" - no one can help anyone. US imperialism is also outwardly strong but inwardly weak, with many difficulties. Since its internal economic crisis will soon break out, and its foreign aggression policy is being resisted by the people of the world, it is overwhelmed by internal and external attacks. Therefore, even if this stillborn puppet alliance is born with the support of the United States, our entire Chinese people and the people of various countries in the Far East will certainly quickly smash it.

### 美帝国主义反对中国人民和远东人民的新阴谋

    美帝国主义反对中国人民和远东人民的新阴谋
    匪首蒋介石与菲总统季里诺举行秘密会议，会后发表所谓联合声明，扬言“两国应立即采取具体而实际的步骤，以促进更密切的经济文化合作”；并鼓吹所谓远东各国“应立即组成联盟，互相援助，以抵制并消除共产党的威胁”。根据各方消息，蒋、季企图筹组所谓“太平洋反共同盟”，纠合南朝鲜的傀儡李承晚，组成这个“同盟”的“核心”，并拉拢远东其他国家的反动派参加，甚至想把日本反动派也包括在这个“同盟”之内。
    蒋介石、季里诺和李承晚都是美帝国主义的代理人，蒋、季的这次会谈及其进行中的新阴谋，显然是由美帝国主义一手策划的。美国国务院发言人麦克德谟十一日即曾表示对蒋、季此举“十分同情”。美帝国主义者策动组织所谓“太平洋反共同盟”，为的是想利用这种较不露骨的方式，假季里诺等傀儡之手，援助国民党残余匪帮作垂死的挣扎。因为美帝国主义已经看到：国民党残余匪帮很快就要被人民解放军从中国大陆上扫荡净尽，它为要奴役中国人民而投下的几十亿美元赌注，差不多已完全输光了。对于这个失败，美帝国主义是决不甘心的。这次蒋、季会谈及正在策划中的所谓“太平洋反共同盟”，便是美国帝国主义继续援助国民党匪帮，反对中国人民解放事业的新花样。同时，这个罪恶勾当，不仅是为了反对中国人民，而且还为了反对菲律宾、朝鲜、日本以及远东其他国家的人民。美帝国主义和它的走狗们鉴于它在中国的失败，鉴于中国人民解放战争的胜利大大鼓舞了远东各国人民的解放斗争，鉴于远东各国人民的政治觉悟一天比一天地提高，正阴谋以“同盟”的方式把各国反动派纠合起来，借以镇压远东人民解放运动，使远东各国永久沦为美帝国主义的殖民地。
    中、菲、鲜三国人民以及远东其他国家的人民必须提高警惕，必须进一步团结起来，共同与这个反对远东人民的罪恶计划，进行坚决的斗争。毫无疑问，只要远东人民团结斗争，美帝国主义及其走狗的任何阴谋是一定能够粉碎的。事实上，在中国和远东各国人民反帝国主义斗争高涨的今天，对于这个所谓“太平洋反共同盟”，甚至反动阵营也不能不承认它的必然失败。这就是美国政府和其他殖民国家政府故意装作不参与这场丑剧的原因。中国人民和远东各国人民的力量已经变得空前地强大。蒋介石已经被打败，季里诺、李承晚、吉田等辈也都处在并不吉利的情况，“泥菩萨过河”，谁也帮助不了谁。美帝国主义也是外强中干，困难重重，它的内部的经济危机既然很快就要爆发，而它的对外侵略政策又遭到世界各国人民的反抗，内外夹攻，穷于应付。所以，这个难产的傀儡同盟即使因为美国的支持而出世，我们全中国人民和远东各国人民也一定会迅速地将它打碎。
