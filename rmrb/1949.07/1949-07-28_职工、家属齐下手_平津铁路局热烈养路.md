Employees and Families Work Together
	Pingjin Railway Bureau Enthusiastically Maintains Roads
[This Newspaper Reported] Responding to the Ministry of Railways' call for road maintenance, employees of the Pingjin Railway Bureau have launched a wave of enthusiasm for road maintenance. Liu Jianzhang, Deputy Director of the Pingjin Railway Bureau, recently mobilized employees in both Pingjin to do a good job in road maintenance work in their spare time. Deputy Director Liu called for: Breaking the erroneous view of despising labor, developing regular labor habits, and learning the road maintenance spirit of Qinhuangdao. More than 1,800 employees and their families at Tianjin North Station have actively participated in road maintenance work, and Deputy Director Liu and his family have also signed up to participate. All employees of the Pingjin Railway Bureau's Beijing office, as well as various units under Beijing East Station and West Station, have also participated in this work. 1,700 people from East Station participated and began cleaning road ballast in their spare time on the 25th. The originally scheduled working time was one hour, but they worked for two hours and were still unwilling to rest. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members of the Telecommunications Institute demonstrated a positive leading role in sifting ballast. Zhang Weizhong of the East Station Engineering Section and his family challenged each other in a competition. The East Station Locomotive Section cleaned 50 meters of road ballast in one day on the 26th.

[Ping City News] The Beijing East Railway Station has universally launched a road maintenance campaign. Since April, the station's employees have carried out several rounds of cleaning up weeds and dirt. Recently, in order to welcome "August 1st" [Army Day], the station's employees initiated a movement to sift stone ballast. Employees and family members of more than ten railway units, including the Electrification Section, Locomotive Section, and Engineering Section, as well as various station chiefs and section chiefs, have actively participated, not stopping even on their days off, competing everywhere to "sift faster" and "sift finer." Workers in the loading and unloading team challenged each other, led by Ren Wanyou, an old worker in his fifties, to strive to be road maintenance pioneers in cleaning the roadbed.
