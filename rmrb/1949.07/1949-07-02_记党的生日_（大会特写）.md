　　Celebrating the Party's Birthday
    (Special Feature of the Congress)
    Su Di
    "Soon the banner of victory will be planted all over China!" At the 28th anniversary celebration of "July 1st" in Beiping, Commander-in-Chief Zhu issued a glorious call to victory, and the entire venue immediately erupted in thunderous applause. "We have won!" More than 30,000 Communist Party members, Youth League members, and hundreds of democrats, with the same joy and excitement, solemnly celebrated the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. These more than 30,000 people, in the past, in the countryside, in the cities—in different regions, carried out the same struggle, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, and finally defeated the enemy, victoriously gathering in Beiping. Celebrating the birth of the Party is also celebrating the victory of the people.
    The commemorative meeting was held at the Xianongtan Stadium in Beiping. The stands and the track were packed with people, all eyes on the giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on the rostrum. Opposite the rostrum, giant portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin hung high. On the podium to the right of the rostrum, the three portraits were of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Ren Bishi. At night, the strong light of mercury lamps shone on these giant portraits, making them radiant. In the center of the field, a large five-pointed star formed by hundreds of electric lights shone brilliantly. The brilliance of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao illuminated the whole of China, and the Chinese people, who had suffered countless hardships, gradually escaped their tragic fate, and the entire East was illuminated as a result.
    The congress paid tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the revolution. The venue of more than 30,000 people was silent. People deeply thought that the victory was not easy to achieve. How many martyrs shed their blood and gave their lives, conducting arduous and heroic struggles against the enemies of the people. Now, they can rest in peace. The whole Party and the entire Chinese people inherit their legacy, and the lofty ideals have been and will be realized.
    Chairman Mao entered the venue at 10:10. More than 30,000 people applauded and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" at the same time, which lasted for a long time. Chairman Mao repeatedly returned the salute to everyone twice, warmly and with a slight smile. He stood on the stage, leading the audience to shout: "The people of all China unite", "Establish the People's Republic of China." This is a battle cry. Chairman Mao's voice was firm and steady, and the voice of the masses was majestic and loud. We have victoriously followed him through the past 28 years of history, and we will continue to follow him to a new and final victory.
    The people of all China love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao so much. Mr. Shen Junru said at the meeting on behalf of the democratic parties: "Let us use action to celebrate the birthday of the Communist Party of China!" Mr. Guo Moruo recited his poem of praise at the meeting, and he sang loudly: "To commemorate 'July 1st', it is best to dedicate our entire lives. Let us unanimously shout: Long live, the CCP! Long live, Mao Zedong!" Mr. Mao Dun, on behalf of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, presented a flag to Chairman Mao.
    The entertainment evening brought people the same excitement. Fireworks released various colors of the rainbow. After a type of firework, the fiery red characters "Long Live Comrade Mao Zedong" appeared in the sky. The words were jumping and burning. People's hearts, people's enthusiasm were also jumping and burning. The song "The East is Red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong" began to be sung. This was the voice of more than 30,000 people, earth-shattering. The fiery red characters "Long Live the Communist Party of China" appeared in the sky, and the song "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China" began to be sung. The fiery red characters "Long Live the Chinese People's Liberation Army" appeared in the sky, and the "Liberation Army March" began to be sung. Thousands of voices were directed towards China's light, China's hope. At this moment, thousands of rockets pierced the dark night sky, and the audience cheered and applauded.
    In Beiping, the past celebrations of "July 1st" were a different scene. A comrade from the Beiping Municipal Party Committee said that last year, on "July 1st", they were working underground in Beiping and could only commemorate in small groups. A ceremony was impossible, and several comrades got together to study the history of our Party's arduous struggle. Three employees of the North China Electric Power Company told me that the environment there was very bad. Last year, the comrades only had a good meal on "July 1st" and celebrated in their hearts. They said that an old employee who had worked in the company for more than 20 years now expressed his desire to join the Party. He said: "I won't go even if the Kuomintang pulls me, the Communist Party represents the truth." An old worker on the Xizhimen Railway who joined the Party in 1938 spoke with many feelings about this year's "July 1st". "In previous years, the more it got to July 1st, the more vigilant we were, afraid of being caught by special agents. This year is different. We celebrate July 1st with great joy, and Party members and non-Party members perform together." Several Party members from Tsinghua and Normal University talked about the glory the Party gave them. Their branch was made public, and some non-Party students said: "My friend is also a Party member!" Some said: "He is a Party member, go ask him if you don't understand." The light of happiness swept across their faces, and in order to maintain this rare honor, they said: "Let's study hard!"

　　记党的生日
    （大会特写）
    苏棣
    “不久胜利的旗帜就可插遍全中国了!”在北平“七一”二十八周年纪念大会上，朱总司令发出光荣胜利的号召，全场立刻响起海涛一般的掌声。“我们胜利了！”三万多共产党员、青年团员及上百位民主人士怀着同样欢欣、兴奋的心情，隆重庆祝中国共产党诞生二十八周年。这三万多人，过去在乡村，在城市——在不同的地区进行同样的斗争，由毛泽东同志领导着，终于打败了敌人，在北平胜利的会合。庆祝党的诞生，同时是庆祝人民的胜利。
    纪念大会在北平先农坛运动场举行。看台上、跑道上人山人海，这些人的眼光都朝着主席台上毛主席、朱总司令的巨像。主席台对面，高悬马、恩、列、斯巨像，主席台右边的指挥台上，三大画像是刘少奇、周恩来、任弼时三同志。入夜，水银灯的强烈光芒照在这些巨像上，神彩焕发。场中用数百盏电灯联成的大五角星，灿烂辉煌。共产党、毛主席的光辉照耀着全中国，遭受重重苦难的中国人民逐渐脱离了悲惨的命运，整个的东方也因而光明了。
    大会向为革命牺牲的先烈致哀，三万多人的会场，静默得没有一点声息。人们深沉的想着，胜利的取得是不容易的。多少先烈洒热血，抛头颅，向人民的敌人进行了艰苦卓绝的斗争，现在，他们可以安息了。全党和全中国人民继承着他们的遗志，崇高的理想已经和就要实现了。
    毛主席在十时十分进入会场。三万多人同时鼓掌，高呼“毛主席万岁”，历久不息。毛主席接连向大家两次答礼，亲切的、微微笑着。他站在台上，领导全场高呼：“全中国人民团结起来”、“成立中国人民民主共和国”。这是一个战斗的号召。毛主席的声音肯定而沉着，群众的声音雄伟而宏亮。过去二十八年的历史，我们已经跟着他胜利的走过了，我们继续跟着他，会走到新的最后的胜利。
    全中国人民是这样热爱共产党、毛主席。沈钧儒先生代表各民主党派在会上说：“让我们用行动来祝贺中国共产党的生日吧！”郭沫若先生在会上朗诵了自己的颂诗，他高声唱道：“要纪念‘七一’，最好把我们的全生命来献奉。让我们一致地高呼：万岁哟，中共！万岁哟，毛泽东！”茅盾先生则代表全国文学艺术工作者大会，向毛主席献了旗。
    娱乐晚会带给人们同样的兴奋。焰火放出各种颜色的虹彩。一种焰火过后，空中显出“毛泽东同志万岁”的火红大字。字在跳动着，燃烧着。人们的心、人们的热情也跳动着，燃烧着。“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东”的歌声唱起来了。这是三万多人的声音，震天动地。空中出现了“中国共产党万岁”的火红大字，“没有共产党就没有新中国”的歌声唱起来了。空中出现了“中国人民解放军万岁”的火红大字，“解放军进行曲”唱起来了。万千声音，一起朝向中国的光明，中国的希望。这时，万道火箭划破黑暗的夜空，全场欢呼，掌声大作。
    在北平，过去纪念“七一”是另外一种情景，北平市委机关一个同志说，去年“七一”，他们在北平作地下工作，只能分小组纪念。仪式是不可能举行的，几个同志凑在一起，学习我党艰苦奋斗的历史。华北电业公司三个职工对我说，他们那里环境很坏，去年同志们在“七一”只是吃顿好饭，心里庆祝。他们说，有个老职员在公司作了二十多年事，现在表示要求入党，他说：“国民党拉我我也不去，共产党代表着真理。”西直门铁路上有个一九三八年入党的老工人，谈起今年“七一”诸多感慨。“在往年，越到七一越警惕，怕被特务抓了去。今年不同了，我们兴高采烈的庆祝七一，党员和非党员一起演戏。”清华、师大几个党员谈起党给予自己的光荣。他们的支部公开了，有些非党的同学说：“我的朋友还有党员哩！”有的说：“他是党员，有不懂的问题去问他。”幸福的光辉抹过他们的脸，为保持这种难得的荣誉，他们说：“咱们努力学习吧！”
