In accordance with Mr. Zhang's will, his body will be partially dissected at Peking Union Medical College Hospital and then sent to Wan'an Public Cemetery for burial on the 12th. Mr. Zhang's will, posthumous works, and the medical history from Peking Union Medical College Hospital will be published today.
　　Medical History
　　Mr. Zhang Ximan, age 55 (previously mistakenly reported as 52), was admitted to the hospital on July 4, 1949. Prior to admission, he had suffered from a cough for seven months and blood in his sputum for over two months. Since becoming ill he has lost about ten pounds. Upon physical examination after admission, a murmur was found in the middle of the right lung, a systolic murmur in the heart, and a slightly enlarged liver; other conditions were normal. An X-ray of the lungs showed a round, solid image in the right lung, 8 cm in diameter. The heart was not enlarged. Laboratory tests showed normal blood and urine, blood in the sputum, normal kidney and liver function, and a lung capacity of 2200 CC. The clinical diagnosis was lung cancer. Except for the slightly enlarged liver, there was no sign of metastasis.
　　After admission, the patient's temperature rose slightly every afternoon, reaching a maximum of 37.7°C. After five days of general preparation and two days of penicillin treatment, surgery was performed at 9:00 AM on July 9 (Note: presided over by Dr. Wu Yinghua, acting director of the hospital's surgery department). During the operation, it was determined that there was no tumor metastasis in the liver. Subsequently, the right chest cavity was opened, confirming a fist-sized solid tumor in the right lung, attached to the parietal pleura. There were two enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, but they could be removed with the lung. A total pneumonectomy was then performed, and the adherent pleura was also removed. The operation lasted three hours, with a blood transfusion of 1200 CC. The patient was in good condition after the operation. At 7:00 PM that day, the patient's condition deteriorated, with difficulty breathing and a weakening pulse. The left lung was filled with wet rales. Cardiotonics and injections to correct pulmonary congestion or edema were immediately administered, and phlegm was suctioned from the trachea. A hollow needle was inserted into the right chest cavity to release air. After two or three hours, the patient's condition gradually improved, but by the next morning, the condition worsened again. A bronchoscopy revealed no phlegm in the trachea. Cardiotonics were continued, but the condition did not improve, and the patient passed away at 2:30 PM that afternoon. According to clinical signs, the patient's cause of death was clearly right heart failure, pulmonary congestion, and pneumonia.

    张西曼先生，五十五岁（前误为五十二岁），于民国三十八年七月四日入院。入院前患咳嗽七个月，痰中带血两月余，病后体重消失约十磅。入院后体格检查，发现右肺中部有杂音，心脏有收缩期杂音，肝稍大，其他情况正常。Ｘ光肺部照像显出右肺内有一圆形实质影像，直径八公分，心脏无肥大征。检验室检查血尿正常，痰内带血，肾及肝功能正常，肺活量二二○○ＣＣ，临床诊断为肺癌瘤。除肝稍大外，无转移现象。
    入院后体温每日午后稍升，最高三七·七度Ｃ，经五日之一般准备及两日之青霉素治疗，于七月九日上午九时施行手术（附注：由本院外科代理主任吴英华医师主持），手术时查明肝内无瘤转移，其后开右胸腔，证实右肺中有拳头大之实体瘤一个，黏于胸膜壁层，纵隔有涨大淋巴腺两个，但可随肺截除，乃施行全肺截除术，黏连之胸膜亦同时截去。手术经三小时，输血一二○○ＣＣ，手术后病人情形良好，当日下午七时病人情形恶化，呼吸困难，脉搏变弱，左肺充满湿性杂音，当即与以强心剂，及改正肺充血或水肿之注射剂，并自气管内吸除痰液，右胸腔内置空针排气，二三小时后病人情形渐佳，惟至次晨，情形又行转恶，经行枝气管镜检查，见大气管内并无痰液溜。随继续施与强心剂，但病情未见好转，延至当日午后二时半辞世。按临床现象，病人死因，显系右心衰竭，肺充血及肺炎。
