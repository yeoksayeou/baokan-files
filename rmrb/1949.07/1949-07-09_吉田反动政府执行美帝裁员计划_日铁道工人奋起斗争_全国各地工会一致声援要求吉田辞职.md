Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 7th: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese laborers are launching a heroic struggle against the government's large-scale layoff plan. In order to implement the "Nine-Point Economic Stabilization Plan" unilaterally issued by the U.S. government and maintain a huge army of unemployed in Japan, the Japanese government recently decided to lay off 160,000 employees within the month of July, of which 95,000 are state-owned railway workers. After refusing to continue negotiations with the state-owned railway workers' union, which has 600,000 members, the Japanese government issued layoff notices on the 4th to the first batch of 30,000 railway workers to be laid off. The laid-off workers will only receive one month's severance pay.

Railway workers in various parts of Japan are engaged in intense struggles to oppose the government's large-scale layoff plan. Because the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries prohibit civil servants from striking, railway union members in Aichi, Shizuoka, Niigata, and other prefectures are launching vigorous protest collective resignation movements. Eleven local branches of railway unions have decided to take "compliance with regulations" action, that is, to strictly inspect vehicles, and any vehicle with even a minor problem will be sent back to the factory. On the 5th, six hundred railway workers in Fukushima clashed with the police and once occupied the railway bureau. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 5th, signs of unrest are coming from all parts of Japan. The struggle of Japanese railway workers has received support from many large and small unions in Japan. The Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Unions, the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee, the Government and Municipal Workers' Union, and the Tokyo Shibaura Factory Union have all issued statements calling for support for the railway workers' struggle. The All-Japan Postal Workers' Union also issued a statement on the 5th demanding the resignation of the Yoshida Cabinet. It is reported that this struggle of Japanese railway workers is being wantonly suppressed by the U.S. and Japanese reactionary authorities. MacArthur issued a statement on the 4th encouraging the Japanese government to suppress the labor movement. Japanese Labor Minister Masabumi Suzuki publicly issued a provocative statement on the 5th saying that the government will "punish labor leaders." Minister of State Kaizumi also said that the authorities are preparing to declare a "state of emergency" and take severe measures to suppress the riots.

　　吉田反动政府执行美帝裁员计划
  　日铁道工人奋起斗争
    全国各地工会一致声援要求吉田辞职
    【新华社北平七日电】东京讯：日本劳工正在展开反对政府大批裁员计划的英勇斗争。日本政府为了执行美国政府所片面颁发的“九点经济稳定计划”，在日本保持庞大的失业军，最近曾决定在七月一个月之内，裁减职员十六万人，其中国营铁道工人占九万五千人。日本政府在拒绝与拥有六十万会员的国营铁道工人工会继续谈判后，已于四日向首批被裁的三万铁道工人发出裁退通知。被裁的工人只发给一个月遣散费。
    日本各地铁道工人为了反对政府这一大批裁员计划，正在进行紧张的斗争。由于美、日反动派禁止公务员举行罢工，爱知、静冈、新泻等县的铁道工会会员正展开蓬勃的抗议性集体辞职运动。十一个铁道工会地方分会已决定采取“遵守规章”行动了，即严格检查车辆，凡有一点毛病的车辆就把它送回车厂去。福岛铁道工人六百名于五日与警察发生冲突，并曾一度占领铁路局。据路透社五日消息，不安的迹象正自日本各地传来。日本铁道工人的斗争，获得了日本许多大小工会的声援。日本产业劳动组合联合会、全日职工会联络委员会、政府市政工人工会、东京芝浦工厂工会等均发表声明，号召支持铁道工人的斗争。全日递信工人工会并于五日发表声明，要求吉田内阁总辞职。据悉，日本铁道工人这一斗争，正遭到美、日反动当局的放肆镇压。麦克阿瑟已于四日发表了鼓励日本政府镇压劳工运动的声明。日劳工相铃木正文五日公开发表挑衅性的声明说：政府将“惩罚劳工领袖”。不管部大臣贝诠三也说：当局正准备宣布“紧急状态”，采取严厉措施镇压骚乱。
