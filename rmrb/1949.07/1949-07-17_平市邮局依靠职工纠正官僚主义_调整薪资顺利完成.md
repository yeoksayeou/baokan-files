Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: The salary adjustment work of the Beijing Post Office has been successfully completed due to the leadership's timely correction of bureaucratic practices and reliance on the masses of employees. The salaries of employees of the Beijing Post Office basically remained at past standards after the liberation of Beijing. However, the business income of the post office was far from keeping up with expenditures. From February 10th to May 31st, the total income was only 41,583,000+ RMB, while the total expenditure reached 137,681,000+ RMB, with losses exceeding income by more than two times. It relied entirely on government subsidies, which in effect increased the burden on all levels of people, especially farmers. On the other hand, the salaries of employees of the Beijing Post Office were higher than those of other enterprises, even higher than the wages of heavy industrial workers engaged in the most complex and arduous labor. In order to rapidly restore and develop production, support the Liberation War, reduce the burden on the people, and prevent the salaries of post office employees from being too disparate from those of other state-owned enterprises, the Transportation Department of the North China People's Government and the North China Postal Administration decided to make appropriate adjustments to the bureau's salaries. However, the Ministry of Communications and the General Post Office of North China did not consult with the post office trade union and post office employees before implementing the adjustment, so that the masses of employees could understand the necessity and methods of salary reduction. Instead, they simply ordered that the May salary be borrowed at a discount based on the April salary. When the salary was paid, the employees were generally emotionally disturbed and very dissatisfied because they did not know the reason for the salary reduction, and they went to the trade union to ask for an explanation.

    After the incident, Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman of the North China People's Government, immediately summoned the heads of the post office administration and trade union to discuss the matter, pointing out that the adjustment of post office salaries was appropriate under the current circumstances, but the methods of the Ministry of Communications and the North China Postal Administration were wrong, bureaucratic, and violated the line of relying on the working class. If the post office's income and expenditure situation is disclosed to the masses of employees and the employees' class consciousness is enlightened, the problem can be solved smoothly. Then, Zhang Wen'ang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Communications, and Su Younong and Cheng Anyu, Director and Deputy Director of the General Post Office, publicly conducted self-criticism to the post office employees, admitting their mistakes and explaining the reasons and necessity for the salary reduction. The post office administration then went on to absorb employee representatives to jointly form a salary investigation and research committee, which put forward a new salary discount plan based on the specific situation. It was decided to use 160 catties of millet as the base, and any amount exceeding that would be discounted by 65%. After the new plan was made, Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, conveyed the spirit of the Sixth Labor Congress to the employees, mobilizing all employees to fully discuss the new plan and put forward their opinions. The post office administration and trade union then conducted systematic education and explanation work in response to the problems raised by the employees in the discussion, explaining that the basic purpose of the revolution is to improve the living standards of the general people. However, the Liberation War is still ongoing, and the people's burden, especially the farmers' burden, is very heavy. In order to support the front and take care of the people's, especially the farmers', ability to bear the burden, we should save state financial expenditure. At the same time, it was explained that the wages of postal workers should not be higher than those of heavy industrial workers. The current salary reduction is precisely to guarantee the jobs of all employees, and it is also for future salary increases. After the post office administration publicly admitted its mistakes and conducted systematic explanation and persuasion work to the employees, the employees' thinking changed greatly. From June 12th, when the new plan was proposed, to the 18th, the trade union received group opinions in which the vast majority of employees expressed their full support for the salary reduction policy and the new salary plan. Then, the second half of June salary was issued according to the new plan. The employees' emotions were not affected, and many people became more active in their work. After the salary reduction movement, not only can the Beijing Post Office reduce the state's financial expenditure of 300,000 catties of millet per month, but also the class consciousness of the post office employees has been generally improved, and the connection between the post office administration, the trade union, and the employees has become closer.

    The North China Bureau's newspaper, the "Beijing People's Daily", disclosed this news on the 14th of this month, and also published a short commentary that reads: The actions of the employees of the Beijing Post Office in saving money and food, consciously increasing the strength of economic construction, taking care of unity, obeying the overall and long-term interests, and increasing the strength of national economic construction demonstrate the attitude of the masters of the country and demonstrate a high degree of responsibility to the country and the People's Government. This spirit is worth learning. However, the Ministry of Communications of the North China People's Government and the North China Postal Administration lacked a clear idea of relying on the working class at the beginning of the movement, and did not unify the responsibility to the country and the responsibility to the workers. They did not discuss the wage issue, which is closely related to the workers' lives, with the trade union and the workers in advance, committing the errors of commandism and bureaucracy. Its failure was inevitable. However, it later publicly admitted its mistakes to the masses of employees, and then relied on the masses of employees. The result not only did not reduce the prestige of the leadership, but also enabled the matter to be completed smoothly. This shows that only by believing in the masses of workers, earnestly mobilizing the workers' class consciousness, adhering to the mass line, and implementing open self-criticism and correction when there are mistakes can things be done well. The lesson of this bureaucratic failure is also worth learning.

### 平市邮局依靠职工纠正官僚主义  调整薪资顺利完成

    平市邮局依靠职工纠正官僚主义
    调整薪资顺利完成
    【新华社北平十六日电】北平邮政局调整薪资的工作，由于领导方面及时纠正了官僚主义作法，进而依靠职工群众，已顺利完成。北平邮局职工的工薪，在北平解放以后，基本上仍然保持过去的标准。但邮局的业务收入则远赶不上支出，从二月十日到五月三十一日，总收入仅人民币四千一百五十八万三千余元，而总支出却达一亿三千七百六十八万一千余元，亏损超过收入两倍以上，全靠人民政府补贴，这实际上就是增加各阶层人民首先是农民的负担。另一方面北平邮局职工的工薪又比其他企业部门的工薪都高，甚至比从事最复杂、最繁重的劳动的重工业工人的工资还高。华北人民政府交通部、华北邮政总局为了迅速恢复与发展生产，为了支援解放战争及减轻人民负担，并使邮局职工的工薪与其他国家企业部门的工薪不致过于悬殊，遂决定对该局工薪加以适当调整。但是交通部和邮政总局却没有在实行调整之前先和邮局工会及邮局职工商量，使职工群众了解减薪的必要和办法，只是简单地命令五月份工薪照四月份折扣借支。在发薪时，职工因为不知道减薪原因，普遍地发生情绪波动，非常不满，纷纷找到工会要求解释。
    事情发生以后，中华全国总工会李立三副主席和华北人民政府薄一波副主席等当即召集邮局行政和工会方面负责人商讨，指出在目前情况下邮局工薪的调整是应当的，但是交通部和华北邮政总局的办法是错误的，是官僚主义的，违反了依靠工人阶级的路线。如把邮局收支状况向职工群众公开，启发职工群众的阶级自觉，问题即可顺利解决。接着交通部副部长张文昂和邮政总局正副局长苏幼农、成安玉都向邮局职工群众公开进行自我批评，承认错误，并说明减薪的原因和必要。邮局行政方面则进而吸收职工代表，共同组成工薪调查研究委员会，按具体情况，提出薪金折扣新方案。决定以一百六十斤小米为基数，超出之数一律打六五折。新方案作出后，中华全国总工会副主席朱学范向职工传达了第六次劳动大会精神，动员全体职工对新方案进行充分的讨论，并提出意见。邮局行政和工会方面又针对职工在讨论中所提问题，进行了系统的教育和解释工作，说明革命的基本目的就在于提高一般人民的生活水平。但目前解放战争尚在进行，人民负担，尤其是农民负担很重，为了支援前线并照顾人民尤其是农民的负担能力，应该为国家节省财政开支。同时说明邮工工资不应比重工业工人工资更高。现在减薪正是为了保障全体职工的职业，也正是为了将来加薪。经过邮局行政方面公开承认错误，并向职工们进行了系统的解释说服工作以后，职工们的思想起了很大变化。自六月十二日提出新方案起至十八日止，工会收到的小组意见中，绝大多数职工都表示完全拥护减薪方针和工薪新方案。接着就按照新方案发出六月下半月工薪，职工情绪不但未受影响，许多人对工作反而更加积极。经过减薪运动以后，不仅北平邮局每月可减少国家三十万斤小米的财政开支，而且邮局职工的阶级觉悟普遍的提高了一步，邮局行政方面与工会和职工之间的联系也更加密切起来了。
    华北局的报纸北平大众日报在本月十四日披露此项消息，同时发表短评略称：北平邮局职工节衣缩食，自觉地增强经济建设力量，照顾团结，服从整体的、长远的利益，增强国家经济建设力量的行动，表现了国家主人翁的姿态，表现了对国家、对人民政府高度负责的精神。这种精神是值得学习的。而华北人民政府交通部和华北邮政总局在运动一开始时，缺乏明确的依靠工人阶级的思想，没有把对国家负责和对工人群众负责两者统一起来，对于这样一个和工人切身生活有密切关系的工资问题事前没有与工会和工人群众好好商量，犯了命令主义和官僚主义的错误，其碰壁是当然的。但后来公开地向职工群众承认了错误，并进而依靠职工群众，其结果不但没有降低领导方面的威信，反而使事情得以顺利完成。这说明只有相信工人群众，认真发动工人阶级的自觉，坚持走群众路线，有了错误就实行公开的自我批评，加以改正，才能办好事情。这种官僚主义碰壁的教训也是值得学习的。
