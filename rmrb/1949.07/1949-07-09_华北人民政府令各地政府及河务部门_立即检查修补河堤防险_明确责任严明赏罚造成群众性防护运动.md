The North China People's Government Orders Local Governments and River Authorities to Immediately Inspect and Repair Riverbanks to Prevent Risks, Clarify Responsibilities, Enforce Strict Rewards and Punishments, and Create a Mass Prevention Movement

[This newspaper reports] The North China People's Government issued Water Administration Order No. 26 on July 5th, ordering the governments of Chahar Province, Beijing Municipality, Tianjin Municipality, the Jidong Administrative Office, the Jizhong Administrative Office, the Jinan Administrative Office, and the Jiluyu Administrative Office, as well as all river authorities, water conservancy bureaus, and flood control headquarters, to immediately and effectively implement the inspection and repair of riverbanks to facilitate flood control, without any delay. The original text of the order is as follows:

Regarding this year's flood prevention arrangements for the rivers of North China, specific decisions have already been made at the North China Water Conservancy Commission's flood control meeting last month. All regions are paying more attention to river management and flood prevention work than in the past. The quality of spring work has generally improved compared to the past, waste has been reduced, and everyone has been able to overcome difficulties, actively prepare materials, and prepare for vigorous flood prevention, which is very good. However, on the other hand, some areas have not yet properly inspected and repaired shortcomings such as rat holes, badger dens, wave nests, water channels, collapse of old projects, and instability of new projects. There is a very serious sense of complacency. According to the Water Conservancy Commission's inspection of a section of the Yongding River project, there are several cracks in the back of the revetments, leaks in the top of the revetments, some optical cable tripods are ineffective due to cracks in the embankments, the embankments are low and incomplete, the permeable dams are abandoned, and the dangerous works that collapsed during the winter ice flood have not been repaired. These repair projects save labor and materials, are easy to do, and are of great importance to strengthening the embankments and preventing floods. If repairs are not carried out seriously during normal times, it will be difficult to compensate for major mistakes even with minor achievements in temporary rush repairs. Countless lessons have shown that those who value general dangerous works but neglect scattered defects often cause irreparable disasters due to a single hole or crack. Therefore, it is hereby ordered that the relevant provinces, municipalities, administrative offices, and river affairs agencies immediately dispatch dedicated personnel to be responsible for inspection and repair, and in accordance with the decisions of the Water Conservancy Commission's flood control meeting, actively organize and deploy, clarify responsibilities, enforce strict rewards and punishments, and create mass movements for inspection, repair, and protection, without any delay.

　　华北人民政府令各地政府及河务部门
  　立即检查修补河堤防险
    明确责任严明赏罚造成群众性防护运动
    【本报讯】华北人民政府为令各地政府及河务部门派专人检查修补各河堤防险工，以利河防，于七月五日发布水行字第二十六号命令，令察哈尔省政府、北平市政府、天津市政府、冀东行署、冀中行署、冀南行署、冀鲁豫行署、各河务局、各水利局、各防汛总指挥部立即切实执行，勿稍延误，命令原文如下：
    关于华北各河流今年防汛布置，已在上月华北水利委员会防汛会议上作出具体决定，各地区对治河防汛工作都比以往重视，春工质量一般已较以往提高了，浪费现象减少了，并且都能克服困难，积极备料，准备大力防汛，这是很好的。但另一方面，有些地区对鼠穴、獾洞、浪窝、水沟、旧工程脱陷、新工程不固等缺点仍未很好检查，随时修补，存在着极严重的麻痹现象。兹据水委会检查永定河一段工程后，报告：仅芦沟桥到金门闸一段，其间有几处埽背裂缝，埽顶漏孔，部分光缆行橛因堤岸裂缝而失效，堤岸卑矮残缺，透水坝废池未用，以及去冬凌汛时险工陷落均未补修。此种补修工程，省工省料，轻而易举，且对固堤防汛有绝大关系。如平时不认真修补，临时仓卒抢险，则虽有小功亦难补大过。无数次经验教训，凡重视一般险工忽视零星残缺者，往往因一穴一缝而演成不可收拾之灾害。为此特令各该省、市政府、行署、河务机关望立即派出专人负责检查修补，并依照水委会防汛会议决定，积极组织布置，明确责任，严明奖惩，造成群众性检查修补防护等运动，勿稍延误为要。
