    How to Prevent Whooping Cough?
    Liu Xiang
    Whooping cough is a bacterial upper respiratory tract infectious disease. Direct transmission is the most important route, but handkerchiefs, utensils, toys, etc. can also serve as intermediaries. The disease is most infectious in the early stages (catarrhal stage). Failure to isolate patients at this time is extremely dangerous. Atypical cases are also important sources of infection because they are overlooked and not isolated. Children under the age of five are most susceptible to infection. The younger the age at infection, the higher the mortality rate. Infants under one year old have a very small chance of recovery, making it a terrible enemy for children.
    Once infected with whooping cough, it is very difficult to treat. Severe cases can be fatal, while mild cases can still cause illness for several weeks. Although some people use sulfa drugs, convalescent human blood, vaccines, and various symptomatic treatments, they have little effect, at most only reducing symptoms and shortening the course of the disease. Recently, highly potent concentrated immune rabbit serum has been introduced, which is more effective; however, it is not a cure-all, and because it is difficult to manufacture, it is very expensive and not easily available for widespread use. The Beijing Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Center is currently experimenting with its production, but it will not be available soon. Therefore, prevention is still the most important measure for this disease.
    In addition to general improvements in hygiene, nutrition, and general resistance, prevention methods include eliminating sources of infection, isolating patients, and immunization. Eliminating sources of infection is very difficult to achieve. To our knowledge, there is currently no way to do so. Isolating patients requires adequate material conditions, such as sufficient hospital beds. Moreover, isolating patients depends on early diagnosis, because patients are most infectious in the early stages, and isolation loses its effectiveness if delayed. Furthermore, whooping cough is most prevalent in poor families and areas with poor environments and crowded living conditions, and these people often cannot afford medical care or implement isolation. Therefore, immunization is still the most important method at present.
    Immunization is usually done with vaccines. Vaccines are made by creating a suspension of killed whooping cough bacteria. However, not just any strain of *Bordetella pertussis* can be used, because once *Bordetella pertussis* is isolated and grown on artificial culture media, it easily becomes denatured, losing its virulence and antigenicity. Therefore, the strain must be carefully selected and regularly inspected to ensure its suitability for vaccine production. Otherwise, the resulting vaccine will be ineffective. Vaccines should also not be used indiscriminately, but only those produced by reliable and reputable manufacturers should be used. There are two types of vaccines: simple and mixed. Simple vaccines contain only *Bordetella pertussis*, while mixed vaccines contain diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. After injection, they can not only prevent whooping cough but also prevent diphtheria and tetanus. These vaccines can be purchased at the Beijing Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Center.
    Whooping cough vaccines have been proven effective in prevention. Approximately 70% to 90% of children who have been injected (subcutaneously) with the vaccine are completely protected, and the rest, even if they get sick, have mild symptoms and rarely die. However, if the vaccine is unreliable or the dosage is insufficient, the expected results cannot be obtained. The injection volume must be large. Most experts advocate a total injection of 80 to 90 trillion bacteria, i.e., eight cubic centimeters of vaccine containing 10 to 12 trillion bacteria per cubic centimeter, or four cubic centimeters of vaccine containing 20 trillion bacteria per cubic centimeter. The total amount is divided into three or four injections, with intervals of three to six weeks between each two injections, and then another injection every six months. Currently, there is no uniform standard for the dosage, and as much as possible should be injected in order to obtain reliable immunity. Infants under one year old have the highest mortality rate from whooping cough, so special attention must be paid to immunization. It is best to inject them at five months, seven and a half months, and nine months, with the first injection being two cubic centimeters of vaccine containing 10 to 12 trillion bacteria per cubic centimeter, and the second and third injections being three cubic centimeters each (or using a vaccine containing 20 trillion bacteria per cubic centimeter, the first injection being one cubic centimeter, and the second and third injections being 1.5 cubic centimeters each). After that, inject again every six months or during a major epidemic. Recently, some people have advocated that mothers be injected with whooping cough vaccine during pregnancy to provide indirect immunity to the fetus, so that they can avoid infection for a short period of time after birth. This is currently being tested and adopted. In addition, the prevention of whooping cough should not be ignored in nurseries, kindergartens, and elementary schools. In poorer families and areas where people live in crowded conditions, the risk of epidemics is also greater, and special attention must be paid to prevention.

    怎样预防百日咳？
    刘＠湘
    百日咳是细菌性的上呼吸道传染病，直接传染为最主要，但手帕、用具、玩具等亦可作为媒介。疾病初期（加答尔期）传染力最强，如不隔离最为危险，不典型的病例因被忽视而不加隔离，也是重要传染来源之一。五岁以下的小儿最易受传染，传染后年龄愈小死亡率愈高，一岁以内的小儿痊愈希望很小，是小儿的可怕敌人。
    百日咳一经受染便非常难治，重者致死，轻者也要病倒好几个星期。虽然有人用硫＠类药物、恢复期人血、菌苗，以及种种对症疗法，可是都收效很小，最多只能减轻症状，缩短病程。最近有高效价的浓缩免疫兔血清问世，功效较著；但也不能药到病除，而且这种血清因制造很难，非常昂贵，不易普遍应用。现在北平天坛防疫处正在试验制造，马上还没有出品，所以对于百日咳这个病主要还应预防。
    预防方法除了一般的改善卫生环境，改良营养，增加一般抵抗力等不外消灭病源，隔离患者及免疫注射。消灭病源是非常难做到的，据我们所知目前还没有办法。隔离患者须有相当的物质条件，如足够的病院病床等，且隔离患者须赖早期诊断，因为初期患者传染力最大，晚了便失去隔离的作用。并且百日咳在环境不良住得拥挤的贫苦人家及区域传染最烈，而这些人常常无力就医也无法实行隔离，所以预防注射在目前还是顶重要的方法。
    预防注射普通是用菌苗，菌苗是把已杀死的百日咳菌制成悬液，但并非任何一株百日咳杆菌都可用，因为百日咳杆菌一经分离出来在人工培养基上很容易变性，失去毒力和抗原性，故菌种必须慎密选择并时常经过检定合格才可用来制造菌苗，否则制成的菌苗就会没有效验，对于菌苗也不应不加选择的使用，而必须用可靠的有信用的制造厂的出品。菌苗有单纯及混合二种，单纯的只是百日咳菌，混合的则加入白喉破伤风类毒素，注射后不但可以预防百日咳，同时也可以预防白喉和破伤风，这些菌苗在北平天坛防疫处均可购到。
    百日咳菌苗在预防上已证明有效，注射（皮下）过菌苗的小儿约有７０％至９０％得到完全保护，其余的即使生了病也很轻，甚少死亡。但如菌苗不可靠或用量不够，都不能得到预期的效果。注射量须大，多数专家主张要一共注射八十至九十兆细菌，即每公撮含菌十至十二兆的菌苗八公撮，或每公撮含菌廿兆的菌苗四公撮。全量分三四次注射，每两次间隔三至六星期，以后每六个月再注射一次。目前对于用量尚无一致标准，应尽可能多注射，以期获得可靠的免疫。一岁以下的小儿得了百日咳死亡率最高，故须特别注意免疫，最好在五个月、七个半月及九个月时各注射一次，第一次注射每公撮含菌十至十二兆的菌苗二公撮，第二三次各三公撮（或用每公撮含菌二十兆的菌苗第一次一公撮第二三次各一点五公撮）。以后每隔半年或遇大流行时再注射一次。近来有人主张母亲在怀胎期间注射百日咳菌苗，可使胎儿间接免疫，在降生后短期内可免传染，已有人在试验采用。此外在托儿所、保育院、幼稚园、小学校尤其不可忽视百日咳的预防注射，在较贫苦的人家及区域，居住得拥挤，流行的危险也大，也须特别注意预防。
