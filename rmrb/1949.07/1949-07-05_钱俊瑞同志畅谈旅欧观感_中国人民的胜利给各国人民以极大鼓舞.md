Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 4th: Qian Junrui, who participated in the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, the Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and the Second National Congress of Trade Unions of Poland, and recently returned to China, spoke freely to reporters about his impressions of his trip to Europe. Qian Junrui said: "The three conferences we attended fully demonstrated the great unity of the working class of various countries and the world's peace and democratic forces. The degree of awareness of the European people is rapidly increasing. These conferences were all powerful demonstrations against the warmongers. Everyone who participated in the conference deeply believes that as long as we continue to work hard, the world peace and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union will surely be able to crush the new war conspiracy and win lasting peace."

Qian Junrui talked about the impact of the Chinese people's victory on the world, saying: "Famous leaders of revolutionary movements in various countries agree that the victory of the Chinese revolution is the third greatest victory for all mankind after the October Revolution and the victory of the anti-fascist Second World War. It broke through the imperialist front in the East and greatly changed the balance of power between democracy and anti-democracy in the world. Obviously, the victory of the Chinese people has given and will continue to give great encouragement and assistance to the people of all countries. Comrade Marty of France said: "Your victory has given us a weapon. As long as French workers hear the words 'poor Chinese have defeated Marshall, making Marshall lose face all over the world,' they will be a hundred times more courageous." Comrade Toromorovic of Poland said: "You have given new strength to us Polish workers." Black singer Robeson said: "One hundred and fifty million black people are eagerly looking forward to Mao Zedong's China with joy."

Qian Junrui said: "In the international workers' movement, opposing nationalist tendencies and strengthening internationalist education is a very important issue. We learned from the Communist Parties of various countries the experience of carrying out internationalist education, and at the same time introduced to the Communist Parties of various countries the situation of the Chinese Communist Party's internationalist education. The high degree of internationalism and the serious struggle against bourgeois nationalism and the aggressive so-called cosmopolitanism spread by American imperialism, which were demonstrated at the several conferences we attended, left me with a deep impression. I feel that within our party and among the working people of the whole country, it is entirely necessary to continue to strengthen internationalist education and oppose all forms of reactionary bourgeois nationalist ideology, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao."

Qian Junrui talked about the construction of the Soviet Union and various new democratic countries, saying: "The Soviet Union is making every effort to complete the first post-war five-year plan this year, and is rapidly moving from socialism to communism. After completing the two-year plan, Czechoslovakia began implementing its first five-year plan this year; Poland is striving to complete the three-year plan this year, and will begin implementing the six-year plan from next year. These two people's democratic countries are working hard to lay the foundation of socialism. Labor competitions are rising in these countries. Whether in the Soviet Union, Poland, or Czechoslovakia, all the working people are involved in a great patriotic upsurge. They are actively carrying out the construction of socialism and communism with their loyalty and love for their motherland. This revolutionary patriotic movement has proven to be an important and constructive spiritual weapon. After eliminating the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Chinese people will inevitably have a new upsurge of patriotism, which will help us carry out our new democratic construction on a large scale."

　　钱俊瑞同志畅谈旅欧观感
  　中国人民的胜利给各国人民以极大鼓舞
    【新华社北平四日电】参加了世界拥护和平大会，捷克共产党第九次代表大会和波兰第二届全国职工大会，最近才回国的钱俊瑞，对记者畅谈他的欧洲旅行的感想。钱俊瑞说：“我们参加的三个大会，充分表现了各国工人阶级和世界和平民主力量的大团结。欧洲人民的觉悟程度正在迅速提高，这几次大会都是对战争贩子们的有力示威。凡是参加大会的人都深深相信，只要我们继续努力，以苏联为领袖的世界和平民主阵营，一定能够粉碎新的战争阴谋，赢得持久和平。”
    钱俊瑞谈到中国人民的胜利对世界的影响时说：“各国著名的革命运动领袖都同意：中国革命的胜利，是继十月革命和反法西斯的第二次世界大战胜利以后的全人类第三次最伟大的胜利。它冲破了帝国主义在东方的阵线，大大地改变世界民主与反民主的力量的对比。显然，中国人民的胜利已经并将继续给予各国人民以极大的鼓舞和助力。法国的马尔梯同志说：“你们的胜利给了我们一柄武器。法国的工人只要听到‘贫困的中国人已经打败了马歇尔，使马歇尔在全世界丢脸’的话，就勇气百倍。”波兰的托摩洛维区同志说：“你们给了我们波兰工人以新的力量。”黑人歌王罗伯逊说：“一万万五千万黑人，都喜得什么似地眼巴巴望着毛泽东的中国。”
    钱俊瑞说：“在国际工人运动中间，反对民族主义倾向，加强国际主义教育，是一个十分重要的问题。我们向各国共产党学习了进行国际主义教育的经验，同时也向各国共产党介绍了中国共产党进行国际主义教育的情况。我们参加的几次大会上，所表现的那种高度的国际主义精神，那种对资产阶级民族主义与美帝国主义所传播的侵略性的所谓世界主义的严肃斗争，使我获得深刻的印象。我觉得在我们党内和全国劳动人民中，根据党中央和毛主席的指示，继续加强国际主义的教育，反对一切形式的反动的资产阶级民族主义思想是完全必要的。”
    钱俊瑞谈到苏联和各新民主国家的建设时说：“苏联正全力争取今年完成战后第一个五年计划，迅速地从社会主义进到共产主义。捷克在完成两年计划之后，今年开始实行第一个五年计划；波兰争取今年完成三年计划，从明年起开始实行六年计划。这两个人民民主国家都在紧张地从事于奠定社会主义的基础的工作。劳动竞赛在这些国家中风起云涌。无论在苏联，在波兰和捷克，全体劳动人民都卷入伟大的爱国主义的高潮中，他们都在以对自己祖国的忠诚热爱来积极进行社会主义和共产主义的建设。这种革命爱国主义的运动，已经证明是富有建设性的重要精神武器。我们中国人民在消灭国民党反动统治之后，也必然会有一个爱国主义的新高涨，这将帮助我们大规模地进行我们的新民主主义建设。”
