Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 21st: The Shandong Mining Bureau is actively strengthening safety and security work. In addition to establishing a Security Committee responsible for studying methods to prevent fire, explosions, water damage, and other potential dangers, implementing them gradually based on urgency, the bureau has also established a Security Section within the Administrative Department to lead, supervise, and inspect security work. On July 1st, the bureau issued a circular to all its affiliated mines, tasking the heads of each mine with overall responsibility for conducting a thorough and detailed inspection. They are to determine effective measures based on the specific circumstances to eliminate incidents that could damage state assets or endanger the lives of workers.

　　After receiving the circular, the Zichuan Public-Operated Hongshan Coal Mine conducted a comprehensive security inspection by all the mine's key cadres. They discovered that the charcoal, oil, sulfur, and calcium carbide warehouses were located next to the iron-melting furnace of the sand-turning plant. Alcohol, sulfur, gasoline, and nitric acid were also mixed with butter and cylinder oil. The electrical wiring in each warehouse was not installed according to regulations and lacked electrical switches. The guard system was lax, and merchants, workers, and those retrieving goods could enter and exit the warehouses freely. Based on the inspection results, the mine immediately took various necessary improvement measures and formulated regulations for warehouse management, gunpowder storage, and other areas. After an inspection by personnel from the Mining Bureau, the Boshan Xihe Coal Mine was found to have three gunpowder depots located close to employee dormitories, offices, and the mine's fire rack. Different types of explosives were stored together in one depot. The mine immediately decided to move all explosives to a location at least one kilometer away from the mine, railways, highways, and civilian houses. Different types of explosives were to be stored in separate depots.

　　山东矿务局通令各矿厂
  　加强防险保安
    【新华社济南二十一日电】山东省矿务局积极加强防险保安工作。该局除成立保安委员会，专门负责研究防火、防爆炸、防水以及其他应防危险的方法分别缓急逐步实施外，并于矿务局行政科内设立保安股，专门负责领导督促检查保安工作。该局并已于七月一日通令所属各矿厂建立各级保安组织，并责成所属各矿由首长负责，即刻进行一次周密详细的检查，根据具体情况决定有效措施，以根绝损害国家财富职工生命危险的事件。
    淄川公营洪山煤矿，接到上述通令后，即由全矿主要干部，进行了普遍保安工作检查，发现木炭、油类、硫磺、电石仓库紧靠着翻沙厂的化铁炉，酒精、硫磺、汽油、镪水等物亦与黄油、汽缸油等混放一起；各库电线安装不够规矩，且无电把子；看管制度不严，商人、工人及领取物品者随便出入库房。该矿根据以上检查结果，立即采取了各种必要改进措施，并拟定了各种仓库管理、火药保管等制度。博山西河煤矿经矿务局派员检查，发现该矿有三处火药库都靠近员工宿舍、办公室和矿井火架，不同性质的炸药混放一库。该矿当即决定所有炸药均迁移至离矿场、铁路、公路、民房至少一千米突以外，不同性质的炸药则分别库藏。
