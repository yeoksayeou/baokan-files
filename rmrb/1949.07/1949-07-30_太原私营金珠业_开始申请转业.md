　　Taiyuan Private Gold and Jewelry Businesses
  　Begin Applying for Change of Profession
    [Taiyuan Dispatch] Private gold and jewelry businesses in Taiyuan City have begun preparing to change professions. To help them change professions, the Taiyuan Military Control Commission has stipulated preferential measures for banks to redeem their gold and silver reserves. However, due to the industry's lack of understanding of the policy, they hesitated for a long time and were not actively preparing for the change. Some gold shops and silver money businesses superficially stopped operating, but secretly resold gold and silver for speculation. After repeated publicity and mobilization by the Taiyuan Branch of the People's Bank of China, among the original thirteen private silver money businesses, Jin Xing and Yu Shenmao have applied to operate, while Xinghua, Yihe, and Jin Yu are preparing to resume business; among the original nineteen gold and jewelry businesses, eleven, including Chun Rufa and Qing Jixiang, have applied to change professions.

　　太原私营金珠业
  　开始申请转业
    【太原电】太原市私人金珠业开始准备转业。太原市军管会为了帮助其转业，银行特规定优待办法收兑其所存金银，但由于该行业对政策尚不了解，所以曾长时间犹疑徘徊，不积极筹备转业，部分金店银钱业更在表面上不营业，暗地里却倒卖金银进行投机。经过人民银行太原分行再三的宣传动员后，原有之十三家私人银钱业，已有晋兴、豫慎茂申请营业，兴华、益和、晋裕准备复业；金珠业原有十九家，现已有春如发、庆记祥等十一家申请转业。
