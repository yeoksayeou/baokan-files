Travel Impressions of the Soviet Union
    Xiao San
    Invited by the All-Union Pushkin Committee, I had the great honor to go to the Soviet Union to attend the grand celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the great Russian poet Pushkin. I saw how the Soviet people respect their cultural heritage and admire their national genius. I saw how prosperous the Soviet culture and art are. At the same time, I saw the great achievements of the Soviet Union in all aspects of construction, which is truly amazing. The people's lives are truly prosperous, which is enviable. Now I would like to talk to our audience about some of the impressions I gained from what I saw and heard there. Many valuable experiences can be used for our reference and learning.
    I flew to Moscow on June 6, the day of Pushkin's 150th birthday. That night, I attended the celebration meeting held at the Soviet National Opera and Ballet Theatre. This meeting was very grand, with thousands of seats filled. Outstanding representatives of the Soviet people of all nationalities, workers, collective farmers, intellectuals, and many leaders of the Party, government, and army attended the meeting. In addition, there were more than a dozen foreign writers and poets from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Finland, Norway, Denmark (the eighty-year-old proletarian writer Nex√∏), England, Italy, Iceland, Australia, the United States (the black singer Robeson), Chile (the famous poet Neruda), China, Mongolia, and North Korea, who were invited to participate in the commemoration ceremony and sit on the presidium with the representative Soviet writers.
    For months, progressive people from all over the Soviet Union and many countries in the world have been holding gatherings, reports, and studies to commemorate Pushkin's 150th birthday. However, the centralized celebration in Moscow began on June 5. On this day, an open-air meeting was held in front of the original Pushkin statue. Fadeyev, the General Secretary of the Soviet Writers' Association, delivered the opening speech. Soviet and foreign poets and writers spoke, and social figures and various groups presented wreaths. The entire base of the statue was covered with flowers. After the open-air meeting, groups of Moscow people came to the statue to admire and worship until late at night, with a constant stream of visitors. This reminds people of Pushkin's poem "Monument":
    "I have erected a monument to myself, not made by human hands,
    The path to it by the people shall not be overgrown with grass,
    Its head, unbowed, rises higher
    Than the Alexander Column."
    At the commemorative meeting on the evening of the 6th, Fadeyev delivered an opening speech, explaining that only the October Revolution and the thirty-plus years of Soviet power and the Communist education of the Bolshevik Party for the people have made Pushkin's legacy a true wealth of the people, and revealed the true meaning of his genius to the people. Since the establishment of the Soviet regime until now, Pushkin's works have been published in 76 languages in the Soviet Union with 56 million copies. That is to say, on average, every family in the Soviet Union has a copy of Pushkin's works, and all the people of the Soviet Union are holding Pushkin's legacy in their hands. Let those who hate the Soviet Union try to oppose this fact of the Soviet people's cultural development! Finally, Fadeyev said: The Soviet intellectuals have made great contributions to the people. No intellectuals in any country enjoy the love and respect of the people as in the Soviet Union. But on the day of commemorating Pushkin, the people have the right to measure each of us by the standard of the great people's Pushkin. The people have the right to say to us: We are waiting for more and better things! Simonov made a long report, analyzing Pushkin's creative life, historical environment, and his great influence on Russian, Soviet, and world literature and culture, calling Pushkin the sun of poetry, a national and popular poet... Then poets and writers from various Soviet republics and foreign countries spoke, unanimously expressing their love and respect for Pushkin and their admiration for the Soviet people's respect for their historical culture. At this meeting, I was also invited to speak. I said that Pushkin wrote a few prophetic poems in his lifetime, saying:
    "My fame will spread throughout great Russia,
    And every language that exists within it will mention my name."
    Now it should be changed to: His fame has spread all over the world, and all languages in the world mention his name. The Chinese know, read, and love Pushkin. The only foreign writer who has a bronze statue erected on Chinese soil is Pushkin. He once thought of going to China during his lifetime, but this wish was not fulfilled. But now he stands proudly on the Huangpu River, in Shanghai, which will soon be completely liberated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. I also said that Chinese writers learn from Russian classical literature and Soviet literature, and have loved this literature since the great Lu Xun. Commemorating Pushkin in China is taking place on the day when the Chinese people are winning a decisive victory against the running dog of American imperialism, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique. We, the inheritors of thousands of years of Chinese history and culture, under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, and hand in hand with all democratic people, are bravely moving towards new victories. I wish our country's literature and art, science and culture flourish, and wish the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people be consolidated.
    All the speeches at this meeting were broadcast to the world via radio.
    On the evening of June 7, a grand commemorative celebration meeting was held in the Hall of the House of Unions, presided over by the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Academician Vavilov, President of the Academy of Sciences, delivered the opening speech, and Pushkin expert Blagoy made a report on Pushkin. Soviet and foreign writers and poets spoke. Like the night before, a grand recreational evening was held after the meeting, reciting Pushkin's poems and performing operas and ballets written by Pushkin.
    The Soviet people's way of commemorating this great poet is very special. Grand commemorative meetings are held in all places related to Pushkin's life and creation.
    We arrived in Leningrad and visited the place where Pushkin participated in revolutionary literary and artistic groups in his early years and the house where he lived in his later years. Everything inside was in the same state as it was during his lifetime, which made people very moved! At the same time, we visited the Museum of the Defense of Leningrad, which showed how difficult and heroic this heroic city was in the days of fighting against the Hitler fascist bandits. No one can but express admiration for the soldiers and civilians of this city. Leningrad was besieged by the German invaders for 900 days. The city was severely damaged, but now there is no trace of the war at all, and everything has been quickly restored. We arrived in Pushkin City, which was occupied and destroyed by the German invaders, about 50 miles from Leningrad, and saw the school where he studied in middle school, the house where he lived as a student, and the hall where he recited poems at graduation. A Pushkin Museum will be reopened here. We arrived in Pskov, a city that was severely damaged by the German invaders, but is now completely restored. We laid wreaths and spoke at Pushkin's grave. We arrived in Mikhailovskoye, where Pushkin was exiled, and saw the Pushkin Museum. On the desk were the last few lines of poetry he wrote when he left this place. A mass meeting of more than 100,000 people was held in the village in the pouring rain. When I spoke, the people under the stage shouted: "Salute the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" "Salute Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China!" On this road, all we saw were Pushkin's poems, portraits, and illustrations of narrative poems...
    We also arrived in the famous heroic city of Stalingrad, which was the turning point of World War II and determined the fate of mankind. During the war, there was not a single complete house, but now it is recovering very quickly and has been built into a very beautiful serpentine city. The tractor factory is working, and the construction of the Palace of Culture has also been completed. The hosts asked for an inscription, and I wrote these few lines: "Heroic city, celebrating rebirth, the Chinese people's liberation also depends on this heroic city!" I also arrived in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, which is also a beautiful city that has been restored quickly. On the streets and in the parks, I saw several large wooden boards with large maps of "The Victorious Progress of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" drawn on them. Small flags were inserted on the liberated cities, and many people were watching. This also shows the Soviet people's concern for the cause of the Chinese people's liberation.
    Finally, I would also like to talk about Moscow. I left Moscow for a full ten years. This year I had the opportunity to go there twice and saw that all the streets and houses in this ancient capital were more beautiful than before. All the people and all the scenic spots felt familiar to me. On May Day, we watched the review of the Soviet armed forces and the parade of millions of people. I also saw the great Stalin standing on Lenin's Mausoleum. He was still so healthy. He was still so kind. He waved to the people, and the people cheered, applauded, and sang to him. Everyone thought: With him, mankind has hope. With him, peace has hope. With him, democracy has hope!
    I have many impressions and thoughts from my two trips to the Soviet Union this year. I plan to write them down slowly and contribute them to everyone. Today I will only talk about it here. (Broadcast Manuscript)
