Travel Impressions of the Soviet Union
    Xiao San
    Invited by the All-Union Pushkin Committee, I had the great honor to go to the Soviet Union to attend the grand celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the great Russian poet Pushkin. I saw how the Soviet people respect their cultural heritage and admire their national genius. I saw how prosperous the Soviet culture and art are. At the same time, I saw the great achievements of the Soviet Union in all aspects of construction, which is truly amazing. The people's lives are truly prosperous, which is enviable. Now I would like to talk to our audience about some of the impressions I gained from what I saw and heard there. Many valuable experiences can be used for our reference and learning.
    I flew to Moscow on June 6, the day of Pushkin's 150th birthday. That night, I attended the celebration meeting held at the Soviet National Opera and Ballet Theatre. This meeting was very grand, with thousands of seats filled. Outstanding representatives of the Soviet people of all nationalities, workers, collective farmers, intellectuals, and many leaders of the Party, government, and army attended the meeting. In addition, there were more than a dozen foreign writers and poets from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Finland, Norway, Denmark (the eighty-year-old proletarian writer Nexø), England, Italy, Iceland, Australia, the United States (the black singer Robeson), Chile (the famous poet Neruda), China, Mongolia, and North Korea, who were invited to participate in the commemoration ceremony and sit on the presidium with the representative Soviet writers.
    For months, progressive people from all over the Soviet Union and many countries in the world have been holding gatherings, reports, and studies to commemorate Pushkin's 150th birthday. However, the centralized celebration in Moscow began on June 5. On this day, an open-air meeting was held in front of the original Pushkin statue. Fadeyev, the General Secretary of the Soviet Writers' Association, delivered the opening speech. Soviet and foreign poets and writers spoke, and social figures and various groups presented wreaths. The entire base of the statue was covered with flowers. After the open-air meeting, groups of Moscow people came to the statue to admire and worship until late at night, with a constant stream of visitors. This reminds people of Pushkin's poem "Monument":
    "I have erected a monument to myself, not made by human hands,
    The path to it by the people shall not be overgrown with grass,
    Its head, unbowed, rises higher
    Than the Alexander Column."
    At the commemorative meeting on the evening of the 6th, Fadeyev delivered an opening speech, explaining that only the October Revolution and the thirty-plus years of Soviet power and the Communist education of the Bolshevik Party for the people have made Pushkin's legacy a true wealth of the people, and revealed the true meaning of his genius to the people. Since the establishment of the Soviet regime until now, Pushkin's works have been published in 76 languages in the Soviet Union with 56 million copies. That is to say, on average, every family in the Soviet Union has a copy of Pushkin's works, and all the people of the Soviet Union are holding Pushkin's legacy in their hands. Let those who hate the Soviet Union try to oppose this fact of the Soviet people's cultural development! Finally, Fadeyev said: The Soviet intellectuals have made great contributions to the people. No intellectuals in any country enjoy the love and respect of the people as in the Soviet Union. But on the day of commemorating Pushkin, the people have the right to measure each of us by the standard of the great people's Pushkin. The people have the right to say to us: We are waiting for more and better things! Simonov made a long report, analyzing Pushkin's creative life, historical environment, and his great influence on Russian, Soviet, and world literature and culture, calling Pushkin the sun of poetry, a national and popular poet... Then poets and writers from various Soviet republics and foreign countries spoke, unanimously expressing their love and respect for Pushkin and their admiration for the Soviet people's respect for their historical culture. At this meeting, I was also invited to speak. I said that Pushkin wrote a few prophetic poems in his lifetime, saying:
    "My fame will spread throughout great Russia,
    And every language that exists within it will mention my name."
    Now it should be changed to: His fame has spread all over the world, and all languages in the world mention his name. The Chinese know, read, and love Pushkin. The only foreign writer who has a bronze statue erected on Chinese soil is Pushkin. He once thought of going to China during his lifetime, but this wish was not fulfilled. But now he stands proudly on the Huangpu River, in Shanghai, which will soon be completely liberated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. I also said that Chinese writers learn from Russian classical literature and Soviet literature, and have loved this literature since the great Lu Xun. Commemorating Pushkin in China is taking place on the day when the Chinese people are winning a decisive victory against the running dog of American imperialism, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique. We, the inheritors of thousands of years of Chinese history and culture, under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, and hand in hand with all democratic people, are bravely moving towards new victories. I wish our country's literature and art, science and culture flourish, and wish the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people be consolidated.
    All the speeches at this meeting were broadcast to the world via radio.
    On the evening of June 7, a grand commemorative celebration meeting was held in the Hall of the House of Unions, presided over by the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Academician Vavilov, President of the Academy of Sciences, delivered the opening speech, and Pushkin expert Blagoy made a report on Pushkin. Soviet and foreign writers and poets spoke. Like the night before, a grand recreational evening was held after the meeting, reciting Pushkin's poems and performing operas and ballets written by Pushkin.
    The Soviet people's way of commemorating this great poet is very special. Grand commemorative meetings are held in all places related to Pushkin's life and creation.
    We arrived in Leningrad and visited the place where Pushkin participated in revolutionary literary and artistic groups in his early years and the house where he lived in his later years. Everything inside was in the same state as it was during his lifetime, which made people very moved! At the same time, we visited the Museum of the Defense of Leningrad, which showed how difficult and heroic this heroic city was in the days of fighting against the Hitler fascist bandits. No one can but express admiration for the soldiers and civilians of this city. Leningrad was besieged by the German invaders for 900 days. The city was severely damaged, but now there is no trace of the war at all, and everything has been quickly restored. We arrived in Pushkin City, which was occupied and destroyed by the German invaders, about 50 miles from Leningrad, and saw the school where he studied in middle school, the house where he lived as a student, and the hall where he recited poems at graduation. A Pushkin Museum will be reopened here. We arrived in Pskov, a city that was severely damaged by the German invaders, but is now completely restored. We laid wreaths and spoke at Pushkin's grave. We arrived in Mikhailovskoye, where Pushkin was exiled, and saw the Pushkin Museum. On the desk were the last few lines of poetry he wrote when he left this place. A mass meeting of more than 100,000 people was held in the village in the pouring rain. When I spoke, the people under the stage shouted: "Salute the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" "Salute Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China!" On this road, all we saw were Pushkin's poems, portraits, and illustrations of narrative poems...
    We also arrived in the famous heroic city of Stalingrad, which was the turning point of World War II and determined the fate of mankind. During the war, there was not a single complete house, but now it is recovering very quickly and has been built into a very beautiful serpentine city. The tractor factory is working, and the construction of the Palace of Culture has also been completed. The hosts asked for an inscription, and I wrote these few lines: "Heroic city, celebrating rebirth, the Chinese people's liberation also depends on this heroic city!" I also arrived in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, which is also a beautiful city that has been restored quickly. On the streets and in the parks, I saw several large wooden boards with large maps of "The Victorious Progress of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" drawn on them. Small flags were inserted on the liberated cities, and many people were watching. This also shows the Soviet people's concern for the cause of the Chinese people's liberation.
    Finally, I would also like to talk about Moscow. I left Moscow for a full ten years. This year I had the opportunity to go there twice and saw that all the streets and houses in this ancient capital were more beautiful than before. All the people and all the scenic spots felt familiar to me. On May Day, we watched the review of the Soviet armed forces and the parade of millions of people. I also saw the great Stalin standing on Lenin's Mausoleum. He was still so healthy. He was still so kind. He waved to the people, and the people cheered, applauded, and sang to him. Everyone thought: With him, mankind has hope. With him, peace has hope. With him, democracy has hope!
    I have many impressions and thoughts from my two trips to the Soviet Union this year. I plan to write them down slowly and contribute them to everyone. Today I will only talk about it here. (Broadcast Manuscript)

　　游苏见闻
    萧三
    兄弟这一次由全苏联普式金委员会的邀请，去到苏联参加俄罗斯伟大的诗人普式金一百五十岁诞辰的盛大的庆祝典礼，非常荣幸地看到了苏联的人民是怎样尊重自己的文化遗产，爱敬自己民族的天才的，看到了苏联的文化文艺是怎样繁荣的，同时也看到了苏联各方面建设的成绩之大，真叫人惊奇，人民的生活真是丰衣足食，使人羡慕。现在把我在那边所见所闻得来的一些印象向我们的听众谈谈。人家许多宝贵的经验都可以供我们的参考和学习。
    我是六月六日，正是普式金一百五十岁生日的那天，飞到了莫斯科的。当天晚上就参加了在苏联国立歌舞大戏院举行的庆祝大会。这个大会是非常隆重的，几千个座位都满了，苏联各民族人民工人、集体农民、知识界的优秀代表，党、政、军的许多首长都到了会。此外，还有十几个外国的——捷克、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、芬兰、挪威、丹麦（八十岁的无产阶级作家内克修）、英国、意大利、伊斯兰地、澳大利、美国（黑人歌王罗伯逊）、智利（名诗人聂鲁大）、中国、蒙古、北朝鲜的作家诗人，这次都被邀请来参加纪念典礼，和苏联的代表作家们一块坐在主席台上。
    苏联各地各民族和世界上许多国家的进步人士，几个月以来就不断地举行了纪念普式金一百五十岁的集会、报告、研究。但是集中地在莫斯科的庆祝是六月五号开始的。这一天在原来有的普式金铜像跟前举行了露天大会，苏联作家协会总书记法捷耶夫致了开会词，苏联的、外国的诗人、作家讲了话，社会人士，各种团体献了花圈。整个铜像座基都被鲜花盖满了。露天大会之后，成群成堆的莫斯科人民到铜像前面来瞻仰、膜拜，直到夜深，游人不绝。这使人想起普式金自己写的“纪念碑”那首诗：
    “我自己立下神工创造的纪念碑，
    民众到那里去的路径上不会生长青草，
    它那颗不肯屈服的头颅抬得
    比亚力山大的纪念柱子还高”。
    六号晚纪念大会上，法捷耶夫致开会词说明只有十月革命和三十多年苏维埃政权及布尔什维克党对人民的共产主义教育，才使得普式金的遗著成为了真正人民的财富，并表露出他的天才对人民的真正意义。自从有苏维埃政权以来直到现在，普式金的著作在苏联用七十六种文字出版了五千六百万份，这就是说，在苏联平均每一个家庭都有一部普式金的著作，全苏联的人都捧着普式金的遗产在自己的手里。苏联人民文化发展的这件事实，让那些仇视苏联的人们试一试来反对吧！末了法捷耶夫说：苏联知识界对人民有伟大的贡献，没有那一国的知识分子象在苏联一样享受人民的爱敬的。但在纪念普式金的日子，人民有权利拿伟大的人民的普式金的标准来衡量我们每一个人。人民有权利对我们说：我们等待着更多更好的东西呵！西蒙诺夫作了一个很长的报告，分析了普式金的创作生活，历史环境和他对俄国、苏联以及全世界文学文化的伟大影响，称普式金为诗歌的太阳，是民族的，同时也是人民的诗人……接着就是苏联各共和国和外国的诗人作家讲话，都一致表示对普式金的敬爱，对苏联人民尊重自己历史文化的羡慕。在这次大会上我兄弟也被邀请讲了话，我说普式金在生之日写过几句预言式的诗，说道：
    “我的名声将在伟大的俄罗斯到处流传，
    它现有的一切语言都要提及我的名姓。”
    现在应该改为：他的名声在全世界都普遍流传了，世界上所有的语言都提及他的名姓。中国人是知道，诵读并爱好普式金的，在中国的土地上给唯一的一个外国作家建立了铜像，那就是普式金。他生时曾经想到中国去，这愿望没有实现。但现在他骄傲地站在黄浦江上，站在不久被中国人民解放军完全解放了的上海。我又说了，中国作家向俄国古典文学和苏维埃文学学习，从伟大的鲁迅开始就很爱好这个文学。在中国纪念普式金，正当中国人民反对美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石反动派取得决定胜利的日子。我们，中国人民数千年历史文化的继承者，在列宁、斯大林旗帜之下，在毛泽东领导之下，和一切民主的人民手携手地勇敢地走向新的胜利。祝福我们国家文学与艺术、科学与文化繁荣起来，祝福中苏两国人民的友谊巩固起来。
    这个大会上所有的发言都用无线电广播到了全世界。
    六月七号晚上由苏联科学院主席团主持，在职工大厦大厅又举行了盛大的纪念庆祝大会，科学院院长瓦维洛夫致开会词，普式金专家布拉戈伊作关于普式金的报告，苏联的，外国的作家诗人讲了话。和头天晚上一样，大会之后举行了盛大的游艺晚会，朗诵普式金的诗，演出普式金所写的歌剧、舞剧等等节目。
    苏联人民纪念这位伟大诗人的办法是很别致的。凡是和普式金生活创作有关的地方都举行盛大的纪念会。
    我们到了列宁格勒，参观了普式金早年参加革命文艺团体的地方和他晚年住过的房屋，里面一切设备都是照他生前的样子，看了使人非常感动！同时又参观了保卫列宁格勒的博物馆，看出这个英雄城在反对希特勒法西斯匪帮战争的日子里是如何地艰苦和英勇的，任何人都不能不对这个城市的军民表示敬佩。列宁城被德寇包围九百天之久，城里破坏的很厉害，但现在已经完全看不见战争的痕迹了，一切都很快地恢复起来了。我们到了离列宁格勒五十来里的被德寇占领破坏过的普式金城，看了他在中学念书的学校，他作学生时住的房子，毕业时念诗的厅子。在这里重新开一个普式金博物馆。我们到了普斯可夫城，这个被德寇破坏很凶的城市，现在完全恢复了。到了普式金的坟墓上，献了花圈，讲了话。到了普式金被流放的米海洛夫村，看了普式金博物馆，书棹上有他离此间这个地方的最后写的几句诗。在村里冒着大雨，开了一个十万多人参加的群众大会。当我讲话时，台下的人高呼：“向中国人民解放军致敬！”“向中共中央毛泽东主席致人民的敬礼！”在这个路上看见的尽是普式金的诗句、肖像、故事诗的图画……
    我们又到了有名的斯大林格勒这个英雄城，它是第二次世界大战的转折点，它决定了人类的命运的。战争时没有一栋完整的房屋，但现在恢复的非常快，建筑成了一个很美的长蛇形的城市。拖拉机工厂在工作，文化宫建筑也完成了。主人们要求题字，我写了这么几句：“英雄城，庆再生，中国人民得解放，也靠这座英雄城！”我又到了基辅，乌克兰的首都，也是恢复得很快的一座美丽的城市，在马路上，公园里我看见几块很大的木板，上面画着“中国人民解放军胜利进展”的大地图，小旗子插在被解放的城市上，看的人很多，这也可见苏联人民对中国人民解放事业的关心了。
    最后，我还要说说莫斯科。我离开莫斯科整整十年了。今年有机会两次到了那里，看见这个古都的一切街道房屋都比以前更漂亮了。所有的人，所有的名胜地点我都觉得亲切。“五一”节那天我们看了苏联武装部队的检阅，几百万人的游行。我又看到了伟大的斯大林，站在列宁墓上。他还是那样的健康。他还是那样的慈祥。他向人们招手，人们向他欢呼、鼓掌、歌唱。所有的人都这么想：有了他，人类就有希望。有了他，和平就有希望。有了他，民主就有希望！
    兄弟今年连续两次游历苏联的印象和感想还有很多很多，我打算慢慢地写出来贡献给大家，今天呢就只谈到这里为止了。　　　　　（广播稿）
