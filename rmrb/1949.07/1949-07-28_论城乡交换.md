　　On Urban-Rural Exchange
    Di Chaobai

　　(I) Connecting Urban and Rural Commodity Exchange is a Crucial Link in Developing Production

    Urban-rural exchange is a crucial link in our series of efforts to develop production and prosper the economy. War has not only destroyed the original production structures but also disrupted the commodity circulation mechanisms and exchange relationships. The decline of the social economy encompasses both production and circulation. Today, since we cannot yet abolish commodity exchange, the importance attached to urban-rural exchange must be on par with the importance attached to increasing agricultural and industrial production.

    The general view that belittles commerce should be changed. Within the liberated areas, after land reform and the establishment of a national economic system, the new urban-rural relationship is different from the old one. The super-economic exploitation of the countryside by the cities has fundamentally changed, or is in the process of changing. Therefore, connecting urban-rural commodity exchange and restoring and establishing public and private commerce have become important links in our development of the national economy, and are currently urgently important.

    The regional self-sufficiency economy we created during the war was imposed by the war and the enemy's superior military encirclement. Today, the conditions are completely different. The area of ​​liberated areas is almost as large as the entire Europe. We already possess a large industrial base across the country. These industries and cities are inseparable from the vast rural areas. Therefore, we must immediately break the past regional self-sufficiency perspective, establish an overall national economic perspective, unite all regions into one, and organically link cities and rural areas across the country.

    Since the Party Central Committee called for the development of production, our industry and agriculture have gradually recovered on the basis of existing production equipment. In just half a year, the industrial production of many cities has exceeded that of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Newly received industrial cities such as Shanghai, Hankou, and Taiyuan have encountered many difficulties, but the recovery work is still satisfactory. In agriculture, the planting area of ​​special crops has greatly increased, and the area of ​​grain production is no less than last year, and the Northeast has exceeded last year. Although the spring drought and insect pests have given some blows to agricultural production in North China, so far they have not been a major blow. We have offset part of the damage caused by the weather with correct guidance and mass strength.

    The reasoning is very clear: Are these efforts we have made in urban and rural production the entirety of our work to develop production and prosper the economy? No, it's only part of it. If we cannot put the produced commodities into the circulation market and obtain exchange, or obtain exchange through the national economic orbit, then our various productions cannot continue (let alone expand), and we cannot achieve the goal of economic prosperity.

    In the course of the long-term war against foreign aggression and internal warfare, the commercial institutions of urban-rural exchange have been severely damaged. Generally, due to the decline of the rural economy, small and medium-sized cities' commercial capital suffered the first blow, and some capital was transferred and concentrated in large cities. Especially in the areas where the People's Liberation Army fought against the enemy, puppet, and Chiang bandits, we implemented a long-term isolation and encirclement policy on the cities, and most of these cities were located on important transportation routes, bearing important responsibilities for the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

    The destruction of some cities and the decline of old-style commercial capital and its institutions are inevitable and unavoidable. However, once we place these dilapidated cities within the system and scope of our new national economy, when the industrial production of large cities has initially recovered, a large amount of public and private commercial capital must be immediately injected into these weakened or emptied cities and towns, and various public and private commercial institutions must be established or restored. This is the primary condition for rebuilding exchange relations between urban and rural areas and for the mutual circulation of industrial and agricultural products.

　　(II) Two New Types of Commercial Capital and Commercial Institutions

    In the five major liberated areas of North China, Northeast China, Northwest China, East China, and Central Plains, we already have some new commercial institutions and commercial capital that are completely different in nature from the old ones: namely, state-owned commercial institutions and their capital, and the institutions and capital of supply and marketing cooperatives. The former is socialist in nature, and the latter is semi-socialist. Those supply and marketing cooperatives that still retain the system of distributing dividends based on shares are state-capitalist in nature.

    The above three types of institutions and capital are new factors in our national economic circulation process. Compared with the remaining pre-capitalist and capitalist commercial institutions and commercial capital, they are different in nature. Because various trade forms that are state-capitalist, semi-socialist, and socialist belong to the national economic system, and they abandon the nature of private capitalism to varying degrees and at different stages.

    However, today, these commercial institutions and commercial capital in the national economic system cannot play a decisive role in the entire process of social commodity circulation. That is to say, only a small portion of our commodities pass through the national economic orbit, and most of the remaining commodities still have to pass through private capitalist and remaining pre-capitalist circulation orbits.

    In the scope of North China, approximately 50% of the grain passes through the national economic orbit. For several export special products, the national economy only controls half of its circulation process, that is, most of it is purchased from the countryside by private commercial institutions and transported to the cities, and then purchased and sold to foreign countries by state trading institutions. The supply and marketing tasks of industrial consumer goods needed by rural areas largely depend on private capitalist and pre-capitalist commercial institutions.

    In order to overcome the anarchy of the market and to gradually eliminate the intermediate exploitation of the exchange of industrial products and agricultural products, the proportion and role of the state economy in the process of social commodity circulation should be greatly developed. Our state-owned trading institutions must expand their business scope and vigorously develop organizations such as supply and marketing cooperatives and production promotion societies. Even rural cooperatives of a state-capitalist nature should not be immediately opposed to their establishment and development under the principle of farmers' voluntary participation.

  　(III) The Relationship between Public Commerce and Private Commerce

    Although the relationship between the state economy and the private economy in the process of commodity circulation is contradictory in nature, they must coexist today. The state's commercial capital should play its leading role, enabling private capitalist and pre-capitalist commercial capital to operate under the principle of benefiting commodity circulation and market regulation. Although the latter's activities inevitably involve various exploitations and disadvantages, in order to enable the commodities of millions of small producers in rural areas to expand their exchange scope with urban industrial products as much as possible, state trading institutions and cooperatives cannot fully bear this task, so the activities of private commercial capital are also necessary. Today, if we do not actively lead the activities of private commercial capital, but subjectively want to restrict the activities of merchants and commercial capital in a passive way, then we will make a huge mistake. Some local comrades have not changed their hostile attitude towards the old capitalist commercial capital. They would rather have the commodities in the hands of farmers accumulate and not be sold than allow merchants to exploit them. The motive of this action is to protect the interests of farmers, but the result is to give farmers greater losses.

    Of course, we cannot ignore the contradiction between capitalist large-scale commerce and state trading agencies in the market. This contradiction needs to be addressed through vigorous and appropriate struggle, giving unscrupulous blows to merchants who dare to speculate, monopolize, or competitively buy and sell in the market, and requiring them to honestly conduct business under state guidance. We still protect them as long as they do legitimate business. As for small and medium-sized merchants and peddlers, the situation is even more different. They generally rely on the quick buying and selling of small commodities for profit. At the same time, the large-scale activities of state trading institutions cannot directly relate to small commodity producers and consumers, requiring millions of supply and marketing cooperatives as organizational foundations before they can be linked to state trading institutions. However, when the supply and marketing cooperatives cannot fully undertake this task in terms of quality and quantity, we must allow small and medium-sized merchants and even peddlers to have full freedom of activity, making them a supplementary force to state trading institutions. Under the new circumstances where the old bureaucratic monopoly capitalism has been eliminated and the pre-capitalist commercial gangs can no longer monopolize the market, small and medium-sized merchants, with the protection of the state economy, will not be unduly exploited by large merchants, and will not turn around to excessively exploit small producers. In the past, due to the rapid decline of small and medium-sized merchants and small and medium-sized cities, most of the private and bureaucratic commercial capital was concentrated in a few large cities, resulting in a surplus of funds in large cities, while a shortage of funds in the interior. This hyperemia of the brain and hemasthenia of the limbs have not yet been overcome. In terms of the composition of commercial capital in the entire society, international trade capital accounts for the largest percentage, commercial capital active in cities comes second, and commercial capital in small and medium-sized cities is the weakest (we can also see this situation from the comparison of foreign trade amounts, bill exchange amounts, urban remittance amounts, and remittances to the interior, etc.). This is a clear picture of a semi-colonial economy. Today, we have restricted foreign trade in quantity, which is the first step in changing this upside-down situation. The subsequent work is to mobilize the funds congested in the cities to small and medium-sized cities, to rural areas, to increase the prices of agricultural products, and to collect the small commodities of small producers in every corner into the market.

    The development of small and medium-sized commercial capital also develops capitalist factors in urban and rural areas, but this is not terrible at present. The important issue is to enable urban and rural products to complete their exchange tasks, enabling agricultural and industrial sectors to carry out expanded reproduction. The expansion of the state economy and the increase of socialist economic components must be gradually achieved in the restoration and prosperity of the entire national economy. Socialism cannot be built on the basis of millions of small producers. To a considerable extent, we cannot prevent the development of capitalist factors in rural areas, as long as we do not forget to collectivize the individual economy at the same time, and never slacken our efforts in the cooperative movement, competing with the spontaneous capitalist production method with the cooperative production method. We can only effectively curb the development of capitalism by providing farmers with a production method that is more progressive and more beneficial than capitalism. As for the reversal of the entire direction, it depends on the strength of industry and the great expansion of the national economy.

　　 (IV) The Meaning and Effect of Free Trade

    Several regulations on developing domestic free trade promulgated by the North China People's Government on July 5th are effective measures to promote urban-rural exchange and expand the scope of trade. Military victories will soon be completed nationwide. The urgent task in the economic field is how to quickly complete our unified national economy.

    Historically, the transition from a regional economy to a national economy was centered on free trade and a single tax as its central policies. However, today our free trade is somewhat different in meaning from the free trade in the early days of capitalism. In the early days of capitalism, free trade only developed capitalism and was only beneficial to the bourgeoisie. In our era, free trade is not only beneficial to capitalism, but more importantly, it is beneficial to the development of the state economy and to the leading role played by the state economy in the entire national economy. The socialist state economy cannot develop without a broad and complete unified market, through which the various parts of the economy are closely linked.

    Free trade is particularly important in breaking and transforming the regional economy developed in guerrilla warfare. Today, the production and distribution of all means of production and consumer goods must focus on the entire country, not just on local areas. During the unification of the domestic market, the adjustment of certain regions and certain productions is inevitable. For example, the hand-operated textile industry in rural North China is declining due to the impact of the restoration of modern textile factories in Tianjin, which cannot be salvaged. If we want to restrict foreign yarn and protect local yarn locally, then we are hindering social progress, and the role in the national economy is not advancing but regressing. Similar situations in other liberated areas have been numerous. We implement free trade with the aim of removing these flimsy bamboo fences of small worlds, allowing progressive production methods to strike backward production methods, and promoting the automatic transformation of backward production methods, promoting the specialization of production in various regions of the country based on their favorable conditions. If the matches produced in Shanghai are cheaper than those in Shandong, then we will let the match industry in Shanghai develop and the match industry in Shandong change industry. Conversely, in the future, the cigarette industry in Shandong will have more favorable conditions than Shanghai, then we will let the cigarette industry in Shanghai change industry or relocate. This example also applies to agricultural production. Although the reorganization of industrial and agricultural production in various places does not rely solely on free trade in the domestic market as a weapon, it is clear that free trade will be a powerful weapon to promote reorganization. Coupled with government leadership and planning, it can most effectively and quickly adjust the various parts of the national economy.

    The adjustment of agricultural and industrial production caused by the unification of the national economic market will inevitably cause some small losses and pains, which are unavoidable. These small losses will enable us to generate large harvests nationwide, and temporary pain will be exchanged for long-term stability. Without this bit of patience, we cannot quickly establish and develop the national economy.

    Our path is to create a unified market through free trade, adjust the various parts of the national economy through the unified market, and then organize production and organize the market, so as to achieve the gradual negation of free trade.

  　(V) The Issue of the Price Ratio of Urban and Rural Commodity Exchange

    Another important issue in promoting urban-rural exchange is the issue of the exchange price ratio between industrial products and agricultural products. If the price ratio between the two cannot be reasonably resolved, it will also hinder the development of urban-rural exchange relations. If the price of agricultural products is too high, it will promote the rise of urban living expenses and increase the production cost of industrial products; if the price of agricultural products is too low, it will weaken the purchasing power of farmers and limit the development of industrial production. In the old Chinese society, the price of agricultural products was often lower than its due price level.

    Although agricultural products are extremely scarce due to the long-term war, the current exchange price ratio between agricultural products and industrial products has not only not increased, but is also far lower than before the war.

    Now let's take Tianjin as an example to study the price ratio of two agricultural products (cotton and millet) and four industrial products (yarn, coal, kerosene, and matches). Let's look at the following table:

    Agricultural Products　　　　　　　　　Xihe Cotton　Yuan Millet
    Industrial Products　　　　　　　　　(Jin)　(Jin)
    　　　　│1935 Average　　　583　3501
    20-count Yarn　│1949.2 Month　　600　6880
    (Piece)　│1949.6 Month　　696　6940
    　　　　│1935 Average　　　24　　148
    Coal　　│1949.2 Month　　　54　　621
    (Ton)　│1949.6 Month　　　55　　482
    　　　　│1935 Average　　　24　　146
    Kerosene (　│1949.2 Month　　　34　　197
    5 Gallons)│1949.6 Month　　17.9　179
    　　　　│1935 Average　　　156　　935
    Matches　　│1949.2 Month　　210　2389
    (Box)　│1949.6 Month　　219　2181

    In the above table, the exchange price ratio between the four industrial products and the two main agricultural products shows that none of the four industrial products is much higher than before the war. For example, before the war, 3501 jin of millet could be exchanged for one piece of yarn, but in June of this year, 6940 jin of millet were needed to exchange for one piece of yarn, almost twice as high. Coal and matches are more than twice as high. Although the increase in kerosene is not so disparate, farmers still suffer a lot compared to before the war. It is worth noting that the price ratio of coal, kerosene, and matches has gradually fallen since the liberation of Tianjin (February to June), which is a good phenomenon. However, the price ratio of yarn is still continuing to rise.

    To suppress the price ratio of industrial products to agricultural products, the main thing is to rely on increasing the production of industrial products. This is not difficult to gradually achieve for industrial products that can be produced in the country. As for foreign industrial products such as kerosene, etc., they may continue to maintain a high price ratio for a considerable period of time. Among the various industrial products that are generally needed in rural areas, yarn and cloth are the major commodities. The excessive price of yarn will have a great adverse impact on the entire urban-rural exchange relationship. Therefore, the adjustment of yarn prices should be an important task of the state-owned China Textile Corporation. Today, the high price of yarn is partly due to market speculators using yarn as the main speculative object, and the demand in cities exceeds the demand in rural areas. But this cannot be used as a reason for us to keep yarn prices high for a long time. How to prevent important market materials from falling into the hands of speculators basically depends on market organization, not price (this is the law of the free market). Although we cannot negate the free market today, or we still have to rely on the free market to some extent, the state economy cannot abandon the task of leadership and regulation, let alone use the power of the state economy to follow the free market.

    The capital accumulation of the state economy should use different methods depending on the nature of various commodities. For consumables or luxury goods such as tobacco and alcohol, wealth should be accumulated with excess profits, and used to subsidize other unprofitable and low-profit state-owned departments. As for the department of general means of subsistence, it should be satisfied with the average profit rate. The rise in the price of means of subsistence will increase general living expenses, which is unfavorable to both agricultural and industrial production. As far as the state economy itself is concerned, it will also outweigh the gains.

　　论城乡交换
    狄超白 　（一）沟通城乡商品交换是发展生产的重要环节
    城乡交换是我们发展生产繁荣经济系列中的重要环节，战争不单单把原有的生产机构破坏了，同时也把商品的流通机构和交换关系破坏了。社会经济的衰退包括着生产和流通的两面，今天我们既还不能废除商品交换，则对于城乡交换的重视，就得与重视农工业增产一样。
    一般轻视商业的观点，应该有所改变了。在解放区之内，当土地改革和建立了国家经济的体系之后，新的城乡关系已不同于旧的城乡关系，城市对乡村的超经济的剥削关系基本已经改变，或正在改变着。因此，沟通城乡商品交换恢复和建立公私商业，已成为我们发展国民经济的重要环节，而且是当前迫切重要的环节。
    我们在战争期间所创造的地区的自给自足经济，乃是在战争和敌人优势兵力包围下被迫而施的。今天，条件完全不同了，已被解放的地区面积几乎有整个欧洲那末大，我们已拥有全国极大部份的大工业基础，这些工业和城市是与广大农村不可分割的，所以必须立即打破过去地区的自给自足观点，建立整体的国民经济观点，把各个地区打成一片，把全国城市和全国农村有机地联系起来。
    自党中央号召发展生产以来，我们的工业和农业，已逐步的在现有生产设备的基础上恢复起来了，仅仅半年的时间，许多城市的工业生产已经超过了国民党反动派统治的时代，刚接收的工业城市如上海、汉口、太原等地，虽遭遇着许多困难，恢复工作还是令人满意的。在农业方面，特种作物的播种面积大大增加了，粮食生产的面积也不少于去年，东北还超过去年。春旱虫灾虽给华北农产一些打击，但迄目前为止岂不是很重大的打击，我们以正确的指导和群众力量抵消了一部份天时所给予我们的损害。
    道理非常明白：我们在城市和乡村的生产方面作了这些努力，是不是就是我们发展生产繁荣经济的全部工作呢？不是的，仅仅是一部份。假使我们不能把生产出来的商品，投入流通市场并取得交换，或者通过国家经济轨道取得交换，那我们的各种生产就不能继续（枉说扩大），就不能达到繁荣经济的目的。
    在长期的对外战争和对内战争的过程中，城乡交换的商业机构遭到严重的破坏，一般的是由于农村经济的衰落，中小城市的商业资本首遭打击，有一部份资本转移集中到大都市里去。尤其在解放军与敌伪蒋匪交战的区域，我们曾对城市实行长期的孤立和包围政策，而这些城市大部位于交通要道，对城乡物资的交换是负担着重要任务的。
    有的城市的破坏和旧式的商业资本及其机构的没落是必然的，不可避免的，但是一旦我们把这些残破了的城市置于我们新的国民经济的体系和范围之内的时候，当大城市的工业生产已有初步恢复的时候，对于这些衰弱了的或真空了的城市镇集，必须立即输入大量公私商业资本和建立或恢复各种公私商业机构，这是使城乡重建交换关系，使工业品与农业品相互流通的首要条件。
　　（二）二种新型类的商业资本及商业机构
    在华北东北西北华东中原五大解放区里，我们已经具有一些新的，与旧时性质完全不同的商业机构和商业资本：那就是国营商业机构及其资本，和供销合作社的机构及其资本。前者是社会主义性的，后者是半社会主义性的，那些仍保留着按股分红制的供销合作社，是国家资本主义性的。
    上述三种机构和资本，是我们国民经济流通过程中新的因素。他们与残存的前资本主义的和资本主义的商业机构商业资本比较，性质上是不相同的。因为，国家资本主义性的，半社会主义性的，和社会主义性的各种贸易形式，都属于国家经济的体系，他们在不同的程度和不同的阶段上扬弃着私人资本主义的性质。
    但在今天国家经济体系中的这些商业机构和商业资本，在社会全部商品流通过程里面，还不能发生决定的作用。即是说，我们只有一小部份的商品是通过国家经济的轨道，其余大部份的商品，还要通过私人资本主义的和残存的前资本主义的流通轨道。
    就华北范围而言，大约有百分之五十的粮食是通过国家经济的轨道的。几种输出特产品，国家经济仅控制其流通过程的一半，即大部份由私人商业机构从农村里搜购而运销到城市里，再由国家贸易机构统购统销到国外去。至有农村所需要的工业消费资料的供销任务，极大部份是依赖着私人资本主义及前资本主义的商业机构的。
    为了要克服市场的无政府状态，为了要逐步消灭工业品与农产品交换的中间剥削，国家经济在社会商品流通过程中的比重及其作用，应该大大的发展。我们的国营贸易机构要扩大它的经营范围，要大力发展供销合作社及生产推进社等类的组织，即使是国家资本主义性的农村合作社，在农民自动自愿的原则下，也不应立即反对其成立和发展。
  　（三）公营商业与私人商业的关系
    国家经济与私人经济在商品流通过程中的关系，虽然二者性质上是对立的，今天还是要同时并存。国家的商业资本应该发挥其领导的任务，使私人资本主义的和前资本主义的商业资本，在有益于商品流通和市场调剂的原则下活动。后者的活动虽不免随带着种种剥削和不利之处，但为着使农村千百万小生产者的商品能与城市工业品尽量扩展其交换范围，国家贸易机构和合作社还不能完全负担这个任务，则私人商业资本的活动也就是必需的。今天我们要是不在积极方面领导私人商业资本的活动，而主观地要在消极方面限制商人商业资本的活动，那就会犯极大的错误。有些局部地区的工作同志，他们对旧时的资本主义的商业资本的仇视观念还没有改变，他们宁可使农民手中的商品积滞不卖，而不愿给商人剥削，这种行动，其动机是保护农民的利益，结果却给予农民更大的失损。
    我们当然不能无视资本主义的大商业在市场上与国家贸易机关的矛盾。这种矛盾需要用大力来作适度的斗争，给敢于在市场上投机垄断或竞买竞卖的商人以无情的打击，要他老老实实安好本分的在国家指导下进行经营管理。需要他做正当买卖，我们还是保护的。至于中小商人和肩挑负贩，情形更不一样。他们一般的依赖着小商品的快卖快买为有利，同时国家贸易机构的大规模活动还不能直接与小商品生产者和消费者发生关系，需要有千百万的供销合作社作为组织基础，然后才能与国家贸易机构联系起来。但是当供销合作社在质与量都还不能全部担当这一任务的时候，我们就得容许中小商人以至肩挑负贩有充分活动的自由，使它成为国家贸易机构的辅助力量。当旧日的官僚垄断资本主义已被消灭，和前资本主义的商业行帮已不能垄断市场的新情况下，中小商人既有国家经济的保护，不至再受大商人的无理剥削，也就不会转过头去过份的剥削小生产者。过去因中小商人和中小城市迅速没落，私人的和官僚的商业资本极大部份集中于少数大都市。以致大都市资金过剩；而内地则资金不足。这种头脑的充血症和四肢的病血症到现在还没有加以克服。以全社会商业资本的构成来说，国际贸易的资本占有最大的百分比，在都市活动的商业资本居其次，而中小城市的商业资本则最为微弱（这种情形，我们也可以从外面买卖数额，票据交换数额，都市汇划数额，和对内地汇款的数额等等的对比上，可以看得出来）。这是显明的一幅半殖民地经济的图画，今天我们已把对外贸易在数量上限制了，这是改变这种倒立情势的第一步，继接着的工作，是要把涌塞于都市的资金动员到中小市城里去，动员到农村里去，提高农产品的价格，并使每一角落的小生产者的微小商品都能搜罗到市场里面来。
    中小商业资本的发展，也发展了城乡资本主义的因素，但这在目前并不可怕，重要的问题是在使城乡的生产品能完成其交换的任务，使农工业可能进行扩大再生产，国家济经的扩大，社会主义经济成份的提高，必须在整个国民经济的恢复和繁荣中才能逐步求得。在千百万小生产者的基础之上是建立不起社会主义来的，相当程度之内，我们不能阻止农村中资本主义因素的发展，只要我们同时不忘记使个体经济集体化，一刻也不松懈对合作运动的努力，以合作的生产方式来与自发的资本主义生产方式竞赛。我们惟有给农民以比资本主义更进步更有利的生产方式，才能有效阻遏资本主义的发展。至于整个方向的扭转，则有待于工业的强大和国家经济大大的扩展。
　　 （四）自由贸易的意义及其效果
    七月五日华北人民政府所颁发展国内自由贸易的几项规定，是目前促进城乡交换扩大贸易范围的有效措施。军事迅将在全国范围内完成胜利，经济方面的迫切任务，是在如何迅速完成我们统一的国民经济。
    历史上，自区域经济过渡到国民经济，曾是以自由贸易和单一税为其中心政策。但今天我们的自由贸易，在意义上多少不同于资本主义初期的自由贸易。在资本主义初期，自由贸易只发展了资本主义，只对资产阶级有利，在我们这个时代，自由贸易不仅仅是对资本主义有利，尤其重要的是对国家经济的发展有利，对国家经济在整个国民经济中所发挥的领导作用有利。社会主义性的国家经济，如没有一个广阔完整的统一市场，通过这个市场把各部份的经　密切联系起来，它的发展是不可能的。
    自由贸易在打破与改造自游击战争中发展起来的区域经济的作用上，意义特别重要。今天一切生产资料与消费资料的生产与分配，必须从全国着眼，不再从局部的地区打算。国内市场统一过程中，某些地区某些生产的调整是势所必然的。例如华北农村的手摇纺织工业，因受天津现代化纺织工厂恢复的影响而趋没落，这是不能挽救的。假如要在地方上限制洋纱而保护土纱，那我们就阻碍了社会的进步，对国民经济所发生的作用不是前进而是倒退，其他各解放区类似的情形曾经不少，我们实行自由贸易，目的是要撤除这些范围小天地的风吹即倒的竹篱笆，让进步的生产方式去打击落后的生产方式，并促起落后生产方式的自动改造，促成全国各地区的生产根据其有利条件而专业化，假如上海生产的火柴比山东便宜，那我们就让上海的火柴工业发展，山东的火柴工业改业。相反的，将来山东的卷烟工业会比上海更具有利的条件，那时我们就让上海的卷烟工业改业或迁移。这种例子应用到农业生产方面也是一样。各地工农业生产的改组，虽然并不专赖国内市场的自由贸易为武器，但显然的，自由贸易将是一项推动改组的有力武器。他与政府的领导与计划配合起来，就能最有效迅速的调整国民经济的各个部分。
    由于国民经济的市场统一而引起农工业生产的调整，必然会引起一些小的损失和痛苦，这是不可避免的。这些小的损失会使我们在全国范围内产生大的收获，一时的痛苦会换得长期的稳定。没有这一点忍性，我们就不可能迅速地建立和发展国民经济。
    我们的道路是通过自由贸易创造统一市场，由统一市场调整国民经济的各部份，然后组织生产组织市场，达到自由贸易的逐步否定。
  　（五）城乡商品交换的比价问题
    促进城乡交换的另一个重要问题，是工业品与农产品的交换比价问题。二者的比价如不得合理的解决，也足以阻碍城乡交换关系的发展。如农产品价格过高，会促使城市生活费用的高涨，增加工业品的生产成本；如农产品价格过低，又会削弱农民的购买力，限止了工业生产的发展。在旧中国社会里，农产品的价格经常低于他应得的价格水平。
    虽然因长期的战争，农产品感到异常缺乏，但目前农产品与工业品的交换比价，不仅没有提高，而且还远低于战前。
    现在我们拿天津来做例子，以两种农产品（棉花小米）和四种工业品（纱、煤、煤油、火柴）的比价来研究，且看下表：
    农产品　　　　　　　　　西河花　元小米
    工业品　　　　　　　　　（斤）　（斤）
    　　　　│１９３５平均　　　５８３　３５０１
    廿支纱　│１９４９．２月　　６００　６８８０
    （件）　│１９４９．６月　　６９６　６９４０
    　　　　│１９３５平均　　　　２４　　１４８
    　煤　　│１９４９．２月　　　５４　　６２１
    （吨）　│１９４９．６月　　　５５　　４８２
    　　　　│１９３５平均　　　　２４　　１４６
    煤油（　│１９４９．２月　　　３４　　１９７
    五加仑）│１９４９．６月　　１７．９　１７９
    　　　　│１９３５平均　　　１５６　　９３５
    火柴　　│１９４９．２月　　２１０　２３８９
    （箱）　│１９４９．６月　　２１９　２１８１
    在上列表格中，四种工业品与两种主要农产品交换的比价，四种工业品没有一种不较战前高出很多，举例来说：战前三五○一斤小米可以换一件纱，而本年六月则要六九四○斤小米才能换一件纱，几乎高出一倍。煤及火柴则达一倍以上。煤油上涨虽没有这样悬殊，较之战前也有农民吃亏不少。其中值得注意的是：煤、煤油及火柴三样物品，自天津解放以来（二月至六月），其对农产品的比价已逐渐下跌，这是好的现象。惟有纱的比价，却仍然继续上扬。
    要抑抵工业品对农产品的比价，主要的要靠增加工业品的生产。这在本国所能生产的工业品，是不难逐步做到的。至于外来的工业品如煤油等类，在相当长时期内，可能继续保持高额的比价。在农村普遍需要的各种工业品中，纱布是大宗，纱价的过高，对于整个城乡交换关系会发生极大的不利影响。所以纱价的调整，应为国营中纺公司的重要任务。今天纱价高的原因，一部分是由于市场投机家将纱布作为主要的投机对象，城市的需要量超过乡村的需要量。但这并不能作为我们长期使纱价高涨的理由，市场的重要物资如何不流入投机者之手，基本上还得依靠市场组织，而不能依靠价格（这是自由市场的法则），我们今天虽还不能否定自由市场，或者多多少少的还要依靠自由市场，然而国家经济却不能放弃领导和调节的任务，更不能用国家经济的力量去跟从自由市场。
    国家经济的资本积累，应视各种商品的性质而运用不同的方法。象烟酒这类的消耗品或奢侈品，应该以超额利润来积累财富，并以之补贴其他无利小利的国营部门。至于一般生活资料的部门，应该以平均利润率为满足，生活资料价格的高涨，会提高一般生活费用，对农工业生产都形不利，就国家经济的本身来说，也会得不偿失。
