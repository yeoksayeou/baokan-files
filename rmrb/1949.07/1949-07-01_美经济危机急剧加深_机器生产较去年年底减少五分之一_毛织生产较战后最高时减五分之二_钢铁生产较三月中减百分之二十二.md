　　US Economic Crisis Rapidly Deepens
    Machine Production Down One-Fifth From End of Last Year　     
    Wool Production Down Two-Fifths From Post-War Peak 
    Steel Production Down 22% From Mid-March
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 30th dispatch] TASS, New York, 29th dispatch: The American economic crisis is deepening at an increasing rate. The Federal Reserve Board announced on the 27th that the US industrial production index (taking 1935-1939 as 100)—generally considered the most accurate figure reflecting the level of American industry—fell almost 3 percent in May (that is, from 179 in April to 174 in May), and according to current indications, the decline in June will be equally drastic. If the Federal Reserve Board's production forecast for June is correct, June's production will be more than 13 percent lower than last November (which was 195). The Federal Reserve Board pointed out that the sharp drop in the May production index reflects the reduction in the production of heavy industry (including the production of iron, copper, machinery, and non-ferrous metals). The Board also pointed out that machine production has decreased by one-fifth since the end of last year. At the same time, consumer goods industries continue to decline significantly. The US textile industry's cotton consumption in May (580,070 bales, each bale weighing 500 pounds) fell to the lowest point since 1939. Rayon has also decreased. The production of wool fabrics has decreased by almost 40 percent compared to the post-war peak. Figures released by the American Iron and Steel Institute on the 27th indicate that the current decline will become more rapid, rather than slowing down as some optimistic officials have said. The Institute announced that steel production fell sharply again this week, the eleventh consecutive week of decline. The Iron and Steel Institute estimates that the steel industry is currently only operating at 79.9 percent of its production capacity (86.7 percent at the beginning of the third week of June), which means that steel production has decreased by more than 5 percent since it began to rise. Since steel production began to decline in mid-March, it has decreased by 22.1 percent. The Business Daily describes the current situation of the steel industry as "one of the most dramatic declines" in the history of the steel industry. Some other industrial sectors have also suffered severe declines that are even worse.

　　美经济危机急剧加深
    机器生产较去年年底减少五分之一　     
    毛织生产较战后最高时减五分之二 
    钢铁生产较三月中减百分之二十二
    【新华社北平三十日电】塔斯社纽约二十九日电：美国经济危机以日益增加的速度加深着。二十七日联邦准备局公布，美国工业生产指数（按一九三五——一九三九年为一○○）——一般认为是反映美国工业水平最正确的数字——在五月份跌落了差不多百分之三（按即由四月份的一七九降至五月份的一七四），而依照目前的迹象看来，六月份的下跌将同样的剧烈。如果联邦准备局对六月份的生产预测是正确的话，六月份的生产将比去年十一月（按为一九五）降低百分之十三以上。联邦准备局指出：五月份生产指数的剧降，反映出重工业生产（包括铁、铜、机器与非铁金属生产）的减缩。该局又指出，机器生产自去年底以来已减少了五分之一。同时，消费品工业亦继续显著的降落。美国纺织业的棉花消费量，在五月份（按为五十八万零七十包，每包五百磅）降到一九三九年以来的最低点。人造丝亦告减少。毛织物的生产，差不多比战后的最高峰降低了百分之四十。美国钢铁研究所二十七日发表的数字指明：目前的下落将更趋猛烈，而不是象一些乐观的官员所说的那样趋于缓慢。该研究所宣布，钢的生产在本周再度急降，这是连续下降的第十一周。钢铁研究所估计，钢工业目前只发挥了钢业生产力的百分之七九·九（按六月第三周开始时为八十六点七），这表示钢的生产自上升起已降低了百分之五以上。自三月中旬钢生产开始下降以来，已降低了百分之二十二·一。商务日报描写目前钢工业的景况是钢业有史以来“最急剧的下降之一”。其他某些工业部门的工业，亦遭受有过之而无不及的严重下落。
