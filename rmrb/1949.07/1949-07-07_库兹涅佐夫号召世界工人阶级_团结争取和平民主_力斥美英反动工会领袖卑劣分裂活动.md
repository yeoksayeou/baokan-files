Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Milan Dispatch: On July 1st, Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions and head of the Soviet delegation to the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Congress, delivered a report at the WFTU Congress on the struggle of the WFTU for peace, the democratic rights of the people, and trade union unity. In his report, which exceeded ten thousand words, Kuznetsov first pointed out that the purpose of organizing the WFTU was to unite workers of all countries to fight for lasting international peace, to improve the living standards of working people, and for their democratic rights and freedoms. Subsequently, Kuznetsov elaborated in detail the crimes of the US monopoly capitalist groups in undermining sincere international cooperation, using the Marshall Plan, the Western European Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to enslave the European people and as tools for provoking new wars. Next, he discussed the various anti-democratic measures implemented by capitalist countries, especially attacks on the rights of trade unions. However, Kuznetsov emphasized that the strength of the democratic camp exceeded that of the anti-democratic camp, and the plans of the warmongers were inevitably doomed to failure. After detailing the WFTU's struggle for world peace and the unity of the working class, Kuznetsov strongly condemned the despicable activities of reactionary American and British trade union leaders such as Carey, Deakin, and Tewson in splitting the unity of the working class. Kuznetsov then described the facts of union members and progressive leaders in various countries adhering to unity and opposing division. He pointed out that in the United States and Britain, the struggle of progressive forces within the trade unions to rejoin the WFTU was developing. In the United States, such large unions as the Seafarers and Longshoremen's Union, the Leather and Shoe Workers' Union, and the Electrical Workers' Union had openly stated their opposition to withdrawing from the WFTU. In Britain, seventeen large trade union organizations opposed withdrawing from the WFTU. The situation was the same in other countries. At the WFTU Congress, delegations from trade unions in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and other countries participated, which was a manifestation of the sentiments of the broad masses of working people. Finally, Kuznetsov detailed the nine tasks of the WFTU. When Kuznetsov's report ended, a storm of applause rang out at the meeting, and the audience stood up and enthusiastically cheered the Soviet delegation for a long time.

　　库兹涅佐夫号召世界工人阶级
  　团结争取和平民主
    力斥美英反动工会领袖卑劣分裂活动
    【新华社北平六日电】米兰讯：七月一日，全苏职工会中央理事会主席、苏联出席世界工联大会代表团团长库兹涅佐夫，在世界工联代表大会上作了关于世界工联争取和平、人民的民主权利和职工会团结的斗争的报告。库兹涅佐夫在长达万余言的报告中首先指出：组织世界工联的目的，是团结一切国家的工人，为国际的持久和平、为提高劳动人民的生活水平、为他们的民主权利和自由而斗争。其后，库兹涅佐夫详细论述了美国独占资本集团破坏真诚的国际合作，用马歇尔计划、西欧联盟及北大西洋公约奴役欧洲人民，并作为挑拨新战争的工具的罪行；接着，他又论述了各资本主义国家实施种种反民主的措施，特别是进攻职工会的权利等。但是，库兹涅佐夫强调地说，民主阵营的力量超过反民主阵营的力量，战争贩子的计划不可避免地要失败。在详述世界工联争取世界和平与工人阶级团结的斗争之后，库兹涅佐夫力斥加莱、狄金和陶逊等美英反动工会领袖分裂工人阶级团结的种种卑劣活动。库兹涅佐夫继而叙述各国工会会员及进步领袖坚持团结、反对分裂的事实。他指出：在美国与英国，职工会中进步力量所进行的争取重返世界工联的斗争正在发展中。在美国，象海员与码头工人工会、皮革与制鞋工人工会、电气工人工会等这样庞大的工会，曾公开表示他们反对退出世界工联。在英国，有十七个庞大的职工会组织反对退出世界工联。其他国家的情况也一样。在世界工联代表大会上，现有比利时、荷兰与卢森堡及其他国家职工会的代表团参加，这就是广大劳动人民群众情绪的表现。最后，库兹涅佐夫详细论列了世界工联的九点任务。当库兹涅佐夫的报告结束以后，大会上响起了风暴般的掌声，听众纷纷起立向苏联代表团狂热地欢呼，经久不息。
