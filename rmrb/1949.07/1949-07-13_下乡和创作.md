　　Going to the Countryside and Creative Work
    Kong Jue
    My family was urban poor. I dropped out of school at sixteen and became an apprentice at the Commercial Press in Suzhou. Later, I became unemployed and even worked as a vegetable vendor with my younger sister at the vegetable market outside Changmen in Suzhou; I also sold sesame cakes on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway with a companion (who is now in Taihang)... Later, I borrowed a diploma, got into a school to learn some technology, and made a living in the surveying field. Due to the various influences of the old society, my thoughts were very confused; my mind was filled with many non-proletarian consciousnesses.
    Fortunately, I arrived in Yan'an not long after, which was already eleven years ago. Because of my love for literature, I entered the Literature Department of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts. During my studies, we went to the countryside once: to help the people with the autumn harvest. This was my first contact with the life of the peasants in northern Shaanxi. At that time, I didn't know how to integrate with the masses, I just wanted to "experience" life and "observe" the characters during the autumn harvest so that I could write about them when I returned.
    Who knew I would run into snags as soon as I went. It turned out that people from the south of the Yangtze River simply couldn't understand the Shaanxi dialect, it was always "unclear." Helpless, I had to spend every day with an old peasant chairman, secretly recording his important conversations in the original sound, and then trying to figure out his meaning or asking Shaanxi classmates for advice.
    Seven days later, when I returned to the Lu Xun Academy of Arts, everyone had to hand in a practice piece; I also wrote a piece called "Peasant Chairman." Because I used some folk language, Comrade Sha Ting, the teacher, thought it was well written. After it was published in "July," Mr. Li Guangtian also praised the language in an essay. However, I didn't realize at the time that my attitude towards going to the countryside was incorrect. At the same time, I didn't understand the true meaning of learning the language of the masses, so I didn't continue to work hard in this area.
    After studying in the Literature Department for a few months, I was sent to the front line for an internship. In northwestern Shanxi, I followed the Independent Fourth Detachment of the 120th Division to fight guerrilla warfare. We were often attacked by Japanese invaders and Yan bandits, and the fighting was very brutal, but I held the attitude of "collecting materials" and spent a few months in the company as a "guest," without becoming one with the soldiers and cadres, without getting much training and transformation myself, and even less familiar with the life of combat. After returning to the Lu Xun Academy of Arts, it was of course impossible to write works that truly reflected the battle; the short stories I wrote were almost all just observations.
    Later, I joined the Communist Party; I was criticized and educated by the Party whenever I had shortcomings. From then on, I began to consciously overcome incorrect ideological consciousness with the correct help of the organization.
    In 1939 and 1940, 300,000 Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan bandit troops surrounded and blockaded the border area. Life in Yan'an was difficult. All organs, troops, and schools went to the mountains to reclaim wasteland and engage in agricultural production. No one did not participate in labor. I was also similarly trained.
    In the summer of 1940, Comrade Zhou Yang (who was in charge of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts at that time) sent me, Ge Luo, Gu Yuan, and others to work in the countryside; he told us to train ourselves in practical work, and first of all, to do our work well and to establish good relationships with the cadres and the masses. We went and took on the duties of anti-traitor director, deputy township chief, and secretary in a township in the central district of Yan'an.
    Several people lived scattered in small villages in the mountain gullies. The desolate and poor rural environment of northern Shaanxi initially made us so unaccustomed! When we ate, the rice and dishes were covered with flies. When we slept, the kang was hot even in the summer, and there were many "bedbugs." There were no empty cave dwellings, so I lived in the home of the self-defense army company commander, and lived in the same cave dwelling as the livestock.
    The peasants were "suffering" in the mountains from sunrise to sunset. Because we wanted to be close to them, we often worked with them. When the superiors assigned tasks, we held meetings with the peasants in the evenings; often we had to stay up until the roosters crowed before we could rest.
    In the countryside, we all suffered from eye diseases and stomach ailments. We also often had nosebleeds. When the weather was hottest, infectious diseases spread; some villages had deaths. We all got sick too. But we persevered.
    Although we lived with the broad masses, we sometimes felt lonely! In those barren mountains and gullies, we took the time to find "scenic spots" to play in, or to "ponder" creative problems in "Thinking Gully." Sometimes when I was really bored, I would run to the top of the high mountain and vent the boredom in my stomach; looking out at the distant south, I missed the plains of my hometown so much. It can be seen that the spiritual life at that time was so far from the peasants!
    The difficulty of language caused me the most pain. I couldn't understand what others were saying, and others couldn't understand what I was saying even more. This required me not only to be able to hear, but also to be able to speak. But I couldn't even speak Mandarin very well. Moreover, learning the local dialect was not only a matter of accent, vocabulary, and expression, but also a matter of life content. I had no choice but to learn to speak like a baby, starting from scratch. Many villagers imitated my accent and made jokes.
    As time went on, I slowly understood and got used to everything; and it was no longer so awkward. But new problems began to arise: I often wanted to write something. If I had time, writing would be appropriate; if I didn't have time, I still had to write, which created a "contradiction" between practical work and creation, inevitably leading to depression. In short, without establishing the idea of serving the masses, I would not be able to settle down to work.
    When the opportunity came, I hurried back to the Lu Xun Academy of Arts. It seemed that the academy was my old home, and going to the countryside was just a temporary cameo in some role.
    At the Lu Xun Academy of Arts, I wrote a few more short stories; there was still no significant progress. Just coming back from the countryside, I especially felt that the works I had written in the past were too Westernized; but I didn't have the ability to make my works popular with the masses. What I wrote turned out to be a mishmash! Especially the language, it simply became a strange hodgepodge. I wanted to write in the language of the masses, trying to achieve "popularization." But when I wrote, it was "laborious and unrewarding."
    After several failed attempts, I began to waver. I changed to using the tone of intellectuals and wrote "Phoenix Flower" and "Erwazi." Ironically, this way of writing was natural and fluent, and was praised by some comrades. But I knew in my heart: "Popularization" had not been "popularized" successfully!
    But I was not reconciled. At that time, I was ambitious and was brewing a long novel. But I started dozens of times and didn't write it down. Sometimes I wrote in the language of the peasants, feeling that the language of the peasants was simple, crude, and insufficient; sometimes I wrote in the language of the intellectuals, feeling that it was not enough to express the life of the peasants. The few "vocabularies" and "materials" that I brought back from the countryside didn't play much of a role. This was really extremely distressing.
    Later, I bit the bullet and wrote tens of thousands of words; the more I wrote, the more wrong it felt, so I asked Comrade Ge Luo to read what I had written first. The title of the novel was "The Millet is Yellow." After he read it, he said that he liked the last small section of the third chapter of the first part. I respected Comrade Ge Luo's opinion. I took the manuscript back and changed one word in the title, calling it "The Millet is Blind." In the local dialect, "blind" means bad. Since the article was written so badly, I didn't need to continue writing!
    After running into so many snags, I also became a little aware. In fact, this was not just a failure of creation, but mainly a failure of life.
    I went to the fifth township in the central district of Yan'an to be the deputy township chief again. This time I no longer pursued language, pursued materials; I tried my best to pursue life, pursue work! As much as possible, I mixed with the peasants and actively completed the work tasks.
    The fact is that in the process of studying life, I truly learned the language; in the process of working hard, I truly obtained the materials.
    I didn't understand a simple truth until then: it turns out that language is inseparable from life. In life, peasants not only use everyday, living spoken language, and the crystallization of those experiences and wisdom passed down from their ancestors - idioms, "common sayings," but also often have brilliant new language creations. Yes, new life produces new language. People of a certain occasion, a certain class, and a certain character speak certain words.
    And work is struggle. Every completion of work has to go through struggle: the struggle between new and old, progress and backwardness, and even revolution and counter-revolution. Only struggle is the material that is truly needed. At that time, I personally handled several marriage cases and obtained the material of "bitter people"; I personally led a peasant commando team to rescue the disaster and obtained the material of "father and son."
    In order to learn to use the language of the masses to express the life of the masses, I specifically used the peasant first person to write "Bitter People" and "Father and Son." I felt that although the language of the peasants had impure, unrefined, and unscientific parts that needed to be refined, processed, and transformed, it was really more beautiful, vivid, and rich than my original language.
    After these two works were published, they were indeed welcomed by many readers; general county cadres and some district cadres were also able to accept them. Comrade Zhou Yang wrote an article criticizing it, believing that my past attitude of observing life had been overcome and that I had begun to have enthusiasm for the new life; at the same time, I had made greater progress in the use of mass language. But he also pointed out the shortcomings.
    These two things still have not small shortcomings: the ideological feelings, the forms of expression, are still not enough, or far from enough, to be popularized with the masses; therefore, they cannot reach the masses.
    The following year, Chairman Mao's speech at the Forum on Literature and Art was published. This was really a remarkable event for me. I began to clarify the idea of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and strengthened the path of transforming myself.
    In the countryside, I was trained for a long time. "Eating bitterness" was not a problem. For a period of time, I ate sauerkraut every day, and my teeth turned black, but I didn't feel bitter. Slowly, I was able to get along with the peasants better. I also learned some methods in my work. After completing tasks one after another, I gradually gained the trust of the district and county, and they no longer regarded me as a "guest." I was first transferred to Xin'er Township in the central district as the deputy township chief, and a year later I was transferred to the Second Township in the southern district to create a model township. There, I encountered a serious plague again. More than fifty people died in our township. I did not escape, and every day I led the masses with the township chief to fight the plague intensely.
    However, even in the middle of creating a model township, I made many mistakes. For example: in order for foreign journalists to visit, I spent money and resources, and renovated the township government into a beautiful organ; I also had a whimsical idea and built a large and useless public toilet in the village of labor heroes, one for men and one for women; in fact, every household wanted manure, so which man or woman "suffering person" would run far away to use such a public toilet? Alas, how was this serving the masses! Fortunately, such mistakes were constantly criticized and corrected by the Party, so they did not continue to develop.
    In that long period of time, I trained my thoughts; when I had time, I wrote things. At that time, I wrote "The Story of a Woman's Emancipation," and a novella about a labor hero (only one-third of which was published). In addition, I wrote many news reports; and small forms of literary and artistic works. At the same time, I began to pay attention to folk songs and ballads. I collected more than one hundred folk tales. I also wrote Yangko operas. I also wrote "Liu Zhidan Singing Book," "Lyrics of Blood and Tears," "Family Ballad"... Trying to use various forms to learn to serve the masses.
    But ten attempts, still nine failures were waiting for me!
    For a period of time, I simply didn't want to create anymore. In the process of creation, I always felt painfully: there was still something invisible separating me from the masses!
    At that time, Yuan Jing and I began to cooperate. Both of us came to the Literary Association from the countryside. In order to meet the needs, we wrote lyrics, wrote large choruses; in addition, we wrote the novel "Black Tiger Village," and the opera "Blue Flower"... But as we wrote, we often felt that we were being pretentious and dominated by a hypocritical emotion. After all, we still couldn't write about the peasants very naturally, and we often couldn't write about their true feelings.
    I remember when I was in the countryside, Comrade Chen Ling said to me: "The villagers seem to 'respect' you very much; this 'respect' is probably not good!" Yes, maybe I was still a person 'above' the masses, and had not become one of the masses; even though I was with the masses every day, there was still a distance and gap between me and the masses in spirit and emotion!
    Chairman Mao said that the change of emotion is a symbol of class change. If we want to thoroughly transform ourselves, so that our thoughts and feelings undergo a decisive class change, we still have to go through a lot of training.
    Soon, we went to the Yulin-Hengshan New District again and plunged into the vigorous land reform struggle. In the struggle, we made up our minds to become close friends with those villagers who were so poor that they wore a cotton-padded jacket for twenty or thirty years.
    Later, we left northern Shaanxi and went to central Hebei; we went to the countryside in the northern part of Daqing River - the Pingjin-Baoding triangle area. The struggle there had been very brutal for ten years. I formally worked as an assistant in the district, and Yuan Jing worked in the Women's Federation. A fierce war unfolded on the nearby Pinghan Line. I gloriously took on the role of stretcher team company commander, leading the peasant stretcher team to the front line, working for days and nights. The sudden change in the situation also caused us to be surrounded by the enemy, and later we were stranded in the enemy's rear; the instructor Guo Yuzhen and I, and many villagers, stubbornly persisted, and after several dangers, we finally returned victoriously.
    Later, Wang Fenggang's bandit army "swept" our area again, and several literary and artistic workers there (Hu Danfei, Qin Beiyang, Yuan Jing, and I...) all participated in the anti-"sweeping" guerrilla warfare or other work. In the case of sharing life and death and sharing weal and woe, it is easiest to become one with the masses.
    In the winter, we were sent to another place to work on land distribution. That was another intense struggle! Yuan Jing fell ill. I was also so tired that I vomited blood. At the end of spring, we were about to leave; many villagers sent us off, so reluctant, and we couldn't bear to part with each other. After we returned to the organ, those male and female villagers, often in groups, ran far to see us. I still keep many letters they sent me. We also often write to them, sincerely caring about their lives, and in terms of emotions, it seems that we have further connected with the masses. Although there were deviations in that work in grasping the policies, the Party continued to educate us, correct us, and improve us.
    Yes, due to the rectification movement, the Party rectification, and the Party's daily education, even if we are slow - we will inevitably progress.
    I seemed to feel that our creation had also begun to get on the right track. When I saw how the lower-level cadres and the masses treated our "Blood Corpse Case" after it was serialized in the Central Hebei Guide, they rushed to read it every day; many people cut it out and pasted it up; some copied it in notebooks; the folk education center recited it to the masses; village theater troupes, folk artists, schools, and art troupes... actively adapted it into Bangzi operas, Erhuang operas, drumsongs, and dramas... and performed it everywhere. These situations made me feel for the first time that our works had begun to enter the masses.
    Later, we went to Baiyangdian... The "New Sons and Daughters Heroic Epic" that we wrote is still being tested among the masses.
    Just because our Marxist-Leninist cultivation is still poor, our minds have not been well armed, and coupled with the lack of fighting experience, we cannot yet produce works that are more mature in thought and art.
    Moreover, the old things have long become a burden on us, and it is difficult to eliminate them for a while, and we have to continue to fight hard.
    We really feel that to thoroughly transform ourselves, we can only solve the problem by throwing ourselves into the mass struggle for a long time and closely integrating with the masses. As for the ways to participate in the work, there can naturally be many ways, depending on the specific circumstances. Some comrades who are politically and artistically cultivated, and who already have enough fighting experience, even if they adopt another way of working in a certain period - with targeted, precise investigation and research, in-depth visits and experiences, may also be able to produce better works.
    Comrade Zhou Yang once said that literary and artistic workers must "practice, create, re-practice, re-create..." Only by constantly training in this way can they constantly improve. Truly starting from ideological and emotional aspects to carry out arduous training, we can only be considered in the first stage. In the future, we must strengthen this training.
    Comrades asked me to write some "experiences," and I don't know how to write them well. Here, I only tell about the detours I have taken, for the reference of comrades who have not been to the countryside.
    Chairman Mao's direction is so clear, let's move forward bravely and perseveringly!

　　下乡和创作
    孔厥
    我的家庭是城市贫民。我十六岁失学，在苏州商务印书馆当学徒。后来又失业，曾经和大妹妹在苏州阊门外菜市上作过菜贩；又和一个同伴（他现在太行）在京沪铁路上卖过烧饼……以后借了一张文凭，考进一个学校学了点技术，在测量界上混碗饭吃。由于旧社会的种种影响，思想很混乱；脑子里装了许多非无产阶级的意识。
    幸亏不久就到了延安，说起来也已经是十一年以前的事了。因为爱好文学，进了鲁迅艺术学院文学系。学习期间，大家下过一回乡：帮助老百姓秋收。这是我第一次接触陕北农民的生活。当时我还不知道跟群众结合，只是想在秋收中间“体验”一下生活，“观察”一下人物，回来好写作。
    谁知一去就碰了钉子。原来江南人简直听不懂陕北话，老是“缠夹不清”。没奈何，只好天天跟一个年老的农民会长泡在一块，时刻把他重要的谈话照原音偷偷记下来，抽空再捉摸他的意思，或是向陕北同学请教。
    七天以后回到鲁艺，每人都得交一篇习作；我也写了一篇“农民会长”。因为采用了一些民间语言，教员沙汀同志认为还写得不错。寄给“七月”发表后，李广田先生在一篇论文里也把那语言称赞了一番。不过当时自己没有意识到：我那下乡的态度是不正确的。同时也不了解学习群众语言的真实意义，因此在这方面没有继续努力。
    在文学系学习了几个月，就被派到前方去实习。在晋西北，跟着一二○师的独立四支队打游击。常常受到日寇和阎匪的夹攻，战斗是很残酷的，然而自己却抱着“搜集材料”的态度在连队上作了几个月的“客”，并没有跟战士和干部打成一片，本身也没有得到多少锻炼和改造，更谈不到熟悉战斗的生活。以后回到鲁艺，当然不可能写出真正反映战斗的作品；所写的几个短篇小说，几乎都只是旁观的记录。
    后来我加入了共产党；一有缺点就受到党内的批评和教育。从此开始在组织正确的帮助下，有意识地克服不正确的思想意识。
    一九三九、四○年，三十万蒋胡匪军包围和封锁边区。延安的生活是艰苦的。各机关部队学校都上山开荒，从事农业生产。没有一个人不参加劳动。我也同样地受着锻炼。
    四○年夏天，周扬同志（那时候鲁艺的负责人）派我和葛洛、古元等下乡工作；叫我们到实际工作中去锻炼，首先要把工作作好，跟干部和群众的关系搞好。我们去了，在延安中区一乡担负锄奸主任、副乡长、秘书等职务。
    几个人分散住在山沟的小村里。荒凉、贫苦的陕北农村环境，一开始使我们多么地不习惯啊！吃饭吧，饭和菜的上面满是蝇子。睡觉吧，夏天也是热炕，还有许多“墙虱”。没有空窑，我住在自卫军连长家里，就和牲口同居一个窑洞。
    农民从日出到日落，都是在山里“受苦”。我们因为要接近他们，常常跟着他们一块儿劳动。上级把工作任务布置下来，我们就在晚上和农民开会；往往要敖到鸡叫才能休息。
    在乡下，我们都害了眼病、肠胃病。还时常流鼻血。天气最热的时候，传染病蔓延了；有的村子死了人。我们也都病倒过。但我们总算坚持下来了。
    虽然同广大群众在一起生活，有时候竟还感到寂寞！在那荒山野沟里，我们抽空找“风景区”玩，或是到“思索沟”里思索创作问题。有时候实在闷得慌，我就跑到高高的山顶上，出一出蹩在肚子里的闷气；眺望着遥远的南方，心里是怎样地想念着故乡的平原啊。可见那时候的精神生活，离农民是多么远！
    语言的困难最使我痛苦。我听不懂别人的话，别人更听不懂我的话。这需要我不但能听，还要能说。我可是连普通话都不怎么会讲。而且学土话不仅是口音、语汇、说法的问题，同时也是生活内容的问题。我就只好牙牙学语，从头学起了。许多老乡学我的口音成为笑话。
    时间长了，什么都慢慢地理解、习惯起来；也就不再那么蹩扭了。可是新的问题开始发生：心里常想写东西。要有空，写作本来是应当的；没有空也硬要写，这就发生了实际工作和创作的“矛盾”，免不了苦闷。总之为群众服务的思想不确立，工作是不会安心的。
    时机一到，我就忙着回鲁艺去了。仿佛那学院才是我的老家，下乡去不过是临时客串了一个什么角色似的。
    在鲁艺，我又写了几个短篇小说；还是没有显著的进步。刚从乡下来，特别觉得过去写的作品太洋化；但又没有能力使自己的作品群众化。写出来竟是四不象！尤其是语言，简直成了奇怪的大杂拌。心里倒是想用群众的语言写，企图作到“大众化”。写起来可是“吃力不讨好”。
    几次尝试失败后，就开始动摇起来。又改用知识分子的语气，写了“凤仙花”和“二娃子”。偏偏这样地写法倒又自然、流利，得到某些同志的赞赏。但心里明白：“大众化”是没有“化”成功哪！
    我却不甘心。那时候好高鹜远，还酝酿着一个长篇的创作。可是开了几十次头都没有写下去。我一会儿用农民的语言写，觉得农民的语言简单、粗糙、不够用；一会儿用知识分子的语言写，又觉得不足以表现农民的生活。从乡下带回的几本“语汇”和“材料”，竟起不了多少作用。这真是苦恼极了。
    后来硬着头皮，写了几万字；越写越不对劲，就把写出来的先请葛洛同志看。长篇的题目叫做“谷子黄了”。他看后，说是喜欢第一部第三章的末了一小节。葛洛同志的看法我是尊重的。我就把稿子拿回来，把题目改了一个字，叫做“谷子瞎了”。土话“瞎”就是坏。既然文章写得那么坏，我不用再写下去了！
    碰了那么些钉子，心里可也有点儿觉悟。实在，这不只是创造的失败，主要是生活的失败啊。
    我又到延安中区五乡当副乡长。这一回我不再追求语言，追求材料；我勉力追求生活，追求工作！尽可能和农民浆在一起，积极完成工作的任务。
    事实是，在学习生活中间，倒是真正地学习了语言；在努力工作中间，倒是真正地获得了材料。
    一个浅显的道理，到那时候才明白：原来语言是跟生活分不开的。在生活中间，农民不仅用日常的活的口语，和祖辈流传的那些经验和智慧的结晶——成语、“俗语”，而且还常常有着光辉的新的语言的创造。是的，新的生活产生着新的语言。在一定的场合、一定阶级、一定性格的人物说着一定的话。
    而工作呢，就是斗争。哪一次工作的完成，都得经过斗争：新与旧、进步与落后，甚至革命与反革命的斗争。只有斗争才是真正所需要的材料。当时我亲手处理了几个婚姻案子，就得到了“苦人儿”的材料；我亲自率领农民突击队去救灾，就得到了“父子俩”的材料。
    为了学习使用群众的语言表现群众的生活，我特意用农民第一人称来写“苦人儿”和“父子俩”。觉得农民的语言虽然有不精粹、不细致、不科学的部分，还需要提炼、加工、改造，可是比起我自己原有的语言来，实在美丽、生动、丰富得多了。
    这两个作品发表后，果然得到不少读者的欢迎；一般县干部、部分区干部也还能够接受。周扬同志写了一篇文章加以批评，认为我过去那种观照生活的态度是已经克服，而开始对新的生活有了热情；同时在群众语言的运用上，也有了较大的进步。但他也指出了缺点。
    这两篇东西是还有不小的缺点：那思想感情，那表现形式，都还不够、或远不够群众化；因此不能达到群众里面去。
    第二年，毛主席在文艺座谈会上的讲话发表了。这对于我真是一件了不起的大事。我开始明确了为工农兵服务的思想，坚定了改造自己的途径。
    在乡下，我长时期地受着锻炼。“吃苦”是不成问题了。有一个时期天天吃酸菜，牙齿都发了黑，倒也不觉得苦。慢慢地我能够和农民相处得比较好。工作上也学会了一些办法。一次次任务完成后，逐渐得到区、县的信任，完全不把我当作“客人”看待了。我先被调到中区新一乡当副乡长，一年以后又调到南区二乡创造模范乡。在那儿又碰上严重的瘟疫。我们这一乡死了五十多人。我没有逃避，天天和正乡长领导群众，紧张地跟瘟疫作斗争。
    可是，就在创造模范乡中间，我还犯了不少错误。举例说吧：为了外国记者来参观，我竟劳民伤财，把乡政府装修成了一个漂漂亮亮的机关；还异想天开，在劳动英雄的村子里，建设了一个大而无当的公共厕所，一间男用，一间女用；实际上家家都要粪，哪一个男的女的“受苦人”会远远地跑去用这样一个公共厕所呀？唉唉，这是怎样地为群众服务！诸如此类的错误，幸亏时时得到党内的批评和纠正，也就不致继续发展下去。
    在那较长的时间里，我锻炼着自己的思想；有了工夫我就写东西。当时写了“一个女人翻身的故事”，和关于一个劳动英雄的中篇小说（只发表了三分之一）。另外还写了不少新闻通讯；和小形式的文艺作品。同时开始注意民歌民谣。搜集了一百多个民间故事。也写秧歌剧。还写了“刘志丹唱本”、“血泪曲唱词”、“一家人弹词”……尝试用各种形式，学习为群众服务。
    可是十次尝试，仍然有九次失败在等着我！
    有一个时期，我简直不想创作了。在创作中间，总是苦恼地感觉：自己和群众还隔着一层什么看不见的东西！
    那时候我和袁静开始合作了。两个人都是从乡下来到文协。为了适应需要，我们写歌词，写大合唱；另外又写“黑虎寨”长篇小说，写“蓝花花”歌剧……可是写着写着，常常觉得自己是在矫揉造作，给一种虚伪的感情支配着。终究我们还不能够很自然地写农民，也常常写不出他们的真实的感情。
    记得在乡下时，陈凌同志对我说过：“老乡们似乎很‘尊敬’你；这个‘尊敬’恐怕不好啊！”是的，大概我还是群众之“上”的人，没有成为群众中的一个；尽管天天和群众在一起，精神上感情上和群众还是会有距离隔阂的！
    毛主席说过，感情的变化是阶级变化的标帜。我们要彻底改造自己，使自己从思想到感情都起决定性的阶级变化，那还得经过多少锻炼啊。
    不久，我们又下乡到榆横新区，投入了轰轰烈烈的土改斗争。在斗争中，我们下决心，和那些穷得一件棉袄穿二三十年的老乡们，结成知心的朋友。
    后来离开陕北，到冀中；我们又下乡到大清河北——平津保三角地区。那儿十年来斗争都是很残酷的。我在区上正式作助理员，袁静在妇联会。激烈的战争在不远的平汉线上展开。我光荣地担负了担架队连长，带着农民担架队到火线上，几天几夜地进行工作。情况的突然变化又使我们受了敌人的包围，后来流落在敌人的后方；我和指导员郭育珍，和许多老乡亲，倔强地坚持，经过了几次危险，终于胜利地归来。
    以后王凤岗匪军又“扫荡”我们的地区，在那儿的几个文艺工作者（胡丹沸、秦北阳、袁静和我……）都参加了反“扫荡”的游击战或其他工作。在同生死、共患难的情况下，是最容易和群众结成一体的。
    冬天，我们又被派到另一个地方作平分土地工作。那又是多么紧张的斗争啊！袁静病倒了。我也累得吐了血。春末，我们要走了；许多老乡送我们，那么留恋，彼此都舍不得分开。我们回到机关后，那些男男女女老乡亲，经常成群结伙，很远地跑来看我们。现在我还保存着他们寄来的许多信。我们也经常地给他们写信，由衷地关心他们的生活，在感情上，似乎是跟群众进一步地联系了。虽然那次工作在掌握政策上还有偏差，可是党在继续地教育我们，纠正我们，提高我们。
    是的，由于整风、整党、和党的日常教育，我们即使缓慢——也必然是要进步的。
    我仿佛觉得，我们的创作也开始走上正路了。当我看见：我们写的“血尸案”在冀中导报连载后，下层干部和群众是怎样对待它。他们每天抢着读；好些人把它剪下、贴起来；也有的把它抄在本子上；民教馆把它朗诵给群众听；村剧团、民间艺人、学校、文工队……积极地把它改编成梆子、二簧、大鼓、话剧………各处演唱。这些情形使我第一次感觉到：我们的作品是开始走进群众里去了。
    后来我们又到白洋淀……所写的“新儿女英雄传”，现在还在群众中受考验。
    只因为我们马列主义的修养还差，头脑还没有很好地武装起来，再加上斗争经验的不足，我们还不可能产生思想和艺术上比较成熟的作品。
    而且，旧的东西在我们身上久已成为负担，一时很难肃清，我们还不得不继续地苦斗。
    我们的确感觉到，要彻底改造自己，只有长时期地投身到群众斗争里面去，密切和群众结合，才能解决问题。至于参加工作的方式，自然可以多种多样，根据具体情况来决定。某些在政治上艺术上有修养、而且已经有了足够斗争经验的同志，即使在某一个时期，采用另一种工作方式——有目标的，精密地调查研究，深入地访问和体验，也未尝不可以产生较好的作品。
    周扬同志曾经说过，文艺工作者必须“实践、创作、再实践、再创作……”这样不断地锻炼，才能不断地提高。真正从思想感情上来加以刻苦锻炼，我们还只能算是在第一阶段。今后我们必须加强这种锻炼。
    同志们叫我写些“经验”，我不知道怎样写好。这里只把我走过的弯路说出来，给没有下过乡的同志参考。
    毛主席的方向是那么明确，咱们勇敢、坚韧地向前进吧！
