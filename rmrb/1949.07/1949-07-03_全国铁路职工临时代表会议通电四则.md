The National Railway Workers' Provisional Representative Conference
    Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee

Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

    Today is July 1st, the 28th anniversary of the birth of the Communist Party of China. On this great day, our National Railway Workers' Provisional Representative Conference opens in the historical city of Beiping. We extend our highest respects to you and express our warm congratulations to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China! Since the birth of the Communist Party of China, our railway workers, under your leadership and the Party's leadership, held the historically famous "February 7th" strike, thus uniting themselves and establishing the All-China Railway Federation, making a lasting struggle for the Chinese revolution. Now that the revolution is about to win nationwide victory, we must prepare to restore the All-China Railway Federation, which has a glorious fighting tradition, in order to unite the 400,000 railway workers across the country to make a more resolute and arduous struggle for the construction of the people's railway of the new China.

    Presidium and All Representatives of the National Railway Workers' Provisional Representative Conference, respectfully
    July 1st

    Telegram of Respect to Commander-in-Chief Zhu and All Generals and Commanders and Fighters of the People's Liberation Army

To Commander-in-Chief Zhu and All Generals and Commanders and Fighters of the People's Liberation Army Comrades:

    Thanks to the heroic and skillful fighting of the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese revolution is about to achieve nationwide victory, enabling us to convene the National Railway Workers' Provisional Representative Conference in the historical city of Beiping. We express our infinite gratitude and highest respects to you! Our gathering this time is to prepare for the restoration of the All-China Railway Federation, which is the fighting organization established by railway workers after the "February 7th" strike. It ceased its activities in 1936 due to various objective reasons. Now we must restore it to better unite the 400,000 railway workers across the country to fight for the rapid restoration of the original railways across the country, the construction of new railways, to support the People's Liberation War until the final victory, and to realize the new China.

    All Representatives of the National Railway Workers' Provisional Representative Conference, respectfully
    July 1st

The National Railway Workers' Provisional Representative Conference
    Telegram to the Third Detachment of the Railway Corps

To All Commanders, Fighters, Engineers and Workers Comrades of the Third Detachment of the Railway Corps: You broke through the predetermined calculations and completed the Huaihe River Bridge, which connects the four major cities in the north and south, one month ahead of schedule. Traffic between Ping and Hu has been interrupted for twelve years. After the completion of the Huaihe River Bridge, direct trains between Ping and Hu resumed service on July 1st. Completing this massive project is your heroic behavior of overcoming nature with Bolshevik tenacity. This is the result of your promoting the spirit of internationalism and humbly accepting advanced Soviet experience. We wish you great victory and all comrades good health, and pay tribute to the labor heroes who have made outstanding contributions. We express our deep condolences to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the cause of the people!

    今天是七月一日，是中国共产党诞生二十八周年纪念日。在这个伟大的节日，我们全国铁路职工临时代表会议在历史名都北平开幕，谨向你致崇高的敬礼并向中国共产党中央委员会表示热烈的祝贺！自从中国共产党诞生不久以后，我们铁路工人就在你和党的领导下举行了历史上有名的“二七”大罢工，因而团结了自己，建立起中华全国铁路总工会，为中国革命作了持久的奋斗。现在革命快要在全国范围内胜利了，我们要把有光荣斗争传统的中华全国铁路总工会筹备恢复起来，以便团结全国四十万铁路职工为新中国的人民铁路建设事业作更坚决的更艰巨的奋斗。

    由于人民解放军的英勇善战使中国革命即将在全国范围内取得胜利，因而使我们全国铁路职工临时代表会议得以在历史名都北平召集，我们谨向你们表示无限的感谢和崇高的敬礼！我们这次集会是为了筹备恢复中华全国铁路总工会，这是继“二七”大罢工后铁路工人建立起来的自己的战斗组织，一九三六年才因各种客观原因停止活动，现在我们要把他恢复起来，更好的团结全国四十万的铁路职工，为迅速恢复全国原有铁路，建设新的铁路，以支援人民解放战争直到最后胜利，并实现新中国而奋斗。

    致铁道兵团第三支队电
    铁道兵团第三支队全体指战员工程师工人同志们：你们突破预定计算，提前一个月完成联贯南北四大城市的淮河大桥。平沪间已经十二年没有通车，淮河大桥竣工后，平沪直达列车，已于七月一日恢复通车。完成这一巨大工程，是你们以布尔塞维克的顽强性战胜自然的英雄行为，这是你们发扬国际主义精神，虚心接受苏联先进经验的结果。谨祝你们的伟大胜利和全体同志身体健康，并对功绩卓著的劳动英雄致以敬意，对于为人民事业奋不顾身因而牺牲的烈士致以沉痛哀悼！
