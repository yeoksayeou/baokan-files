From Tangshan:
    Railway workers at Qinhuangdao Station on the Beining Line have successfully completed the roadbed repair and subgrade cleaning maintenance work. Starting from February 21st, after three major cleaning and roadbed repair campaigns, all ten units of the station, 639 employees, family members, and elementary school students actively participated, thoroughly rectifying 14,899 meters of the station's roadbed and neatly laying the ballast stones. The dirt and weeds left behind by the Japanese puppets and Kuomintang bandits were completely cleared away by the workers. The effect of this movement has laid the foundation for the maintenance work of the station's internal lines, ensuring the safety of train operations and increasing train speed and transportation volume. More than 22,300 sleepers within the railway area of the station can have their lifespan extended by more than two years. On July 8th, Deputy Director Liu Jianzhang of the Tianjin-Beijing Railway Bureau and all representatives of the Tianjin-Beijing Railway Bureau's engineering meeting, about 100 people, visited and inspected the road maintenance work along the line. On the same day, a grand award ceremony was held at the Railway Club, awarding the station a "Road Maintenance Pioneer" banner and a bonus of 100,000 yuan.
