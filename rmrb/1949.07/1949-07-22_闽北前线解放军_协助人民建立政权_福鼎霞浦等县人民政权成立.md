Xinhua News Agency, Northern Fujian Front, 21st: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, advancing into northern Fujian, is simultaneously suppressing scattered bandits and working with the local people to establish local democratic political power and local armed forces. Before liberating Fuding, this unit sent personnel to the mountainous areas to contact the CCP Fuding County Committee. Three days after the county was liberated, the People's County Government was established and began taking over enemy military, political, financial, and economic organs. After Zherong was liberated, the unit also sent cadres to help the people's local government to take in the scattered soldiers of the bandit army and collect the guns hidden by the bandit army, so that order in the city was quickly restored. After the liberation of Xiapu City and Qinyu Town, a regimental commander of the unit personally assisted the local CCP committee in establishing a county-level and a district-level government, and convened mass meetings to publicize the Eight Articles of the Covenant. The People's Liberation Army also often draws a portion of the captured weapons and ammunition to equip the People's Guerrilla. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the people's armed forces in various counties and districts in northeastern Fujian are rapidly developing and growing stronger.

    【新华社闽北前线二十一日电】进抵福建北部的人民解放军某部，一面清剿散匪，一面与当地人民共同建立地方民主政权和地方武装。该部于解放福鼎前，即派人到山区与中共福鼎县委取得联络，该县解放后三天，人民县政府即告成立，并开始接管敌军、政、财经等机关。柘荣解放后，该部也派出干部帮助人民地方政权收容匪军散兵，收缴匪军隐匿的枪支，使该城秩序迅速恢复。该部某团团长，于霞浦城和秦屿镇解放后，亲自协助该地中共党委建立了一个县和一个区的政权，并召开群众大会，宣传约法八章。解放军并常抽出一部分缴获的武器弹药装备人民游击队。闽东北各县区人民武装在解放军的扶助下，正迅速发展壮大中。
