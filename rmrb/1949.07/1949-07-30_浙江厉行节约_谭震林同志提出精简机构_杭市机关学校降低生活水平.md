Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 29th: Zhejiang Province's various agencies are strictly implementing thrift and savings. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a cadre meeting to discuss how the province's Party, government, and military could strictly implement thrift and savings and oppose waste. Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, in his speech at the meeting, demanded that all levels of agencies in the province strictly examine the enormous waste caused by organizational structures and work styles unsuitable for the urban environment, and immediately and thoroughly change this. He proposed the following principles of thrift and savings: First, streamline institutions. In accordance with the characteristics of the city, abolish all unreasonable and superfluous organizations, and reduce unnecessary personnel. For example, abolish individual bodyguards and establish security forces for each unit; abolish the universal communications teams in each unit and establish internal mail, and abolish private orderlies and replace them with public laundry services. In this way, transfer all personnel who can be transferred to strengthen rural work, as well as to strengthen certain departments that must be strengthened, such as public security work and tax collection work. Each unit should complete this work on time.

Second, implement simplified administration. Abolish all unnecessary and cumbersome procedures. All units must centralize office work, have scientific systems, leadership must be in-depth, and procedures must be simple. Unnecessary meetings should be reduced as much as possible.

Third, adjust housing and adjust transportation. All units should gradually establish public offices and public canteens. Except for personnel with families, no one should live alone in a room. Strengthen public transportation facilities.

Fourth, oppose waste, save expenses, and reduce living standards. Responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee will, starting from today, abolish small and medium-sized canteens and switch to eating in the large canteen.

After the meeting, various agencies, factories, and schools in Hangzhou immediately arranged for implementation. The Municipal Government has begun to adjust its structure. The number of cadres in the General Office and the Civil Affairs Bureau alone has been reduced from 114 to 86, and the number of service personnel has been reduced from 121 to 35. Individual bodyguards, messengers, and porters have all been abolished. The Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government have abolished small and medium-sized canteens and all switched to eating in the large canteen. The Municipal Government, the Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Public Security Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and other units have all formulated savings plans, and methods of saving electricity and water have begun to be implemented and have achieved considerable results. The staff and workers of the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Bureau also launched a campaign to save one day's rice ration to relieve flood victims, and more than 100 staff and workers donated a total of 82,000 yuan and a portion of rice coupons. Students of the Hangzhou Youth Cadre School also changed their dinner to thin porridge to save grain for disaster relief.

　　浙江厉行节约
  　谭震林同志提出精简机构
    杭市机关学校降低生活水平
    【新华社杭州二十九日电】浙江省各机关厉行节约。中共浙江省委曾于日前召开干部会议，讨论全省党、政、军如何厉行节约，反对浪费问题。省委书记谭震林在会上的讲话中要求全省各级机关严格检讨因组织机构、作风等不适合于城市环境而造成的巨大浪费，并立即彻底改变。他提出节约原则如下：第一、精简机构。按照城市特点，取消一切不合理的、多余的组织，减少非必要的人员。例如取消个人警卫员，建立各单位的警卫武装；取消各单位的通用通讯班，设立内邮，取消私人勤务员代之以公共的洗衣局。这样调出所有可以调出的人员去加强农村工作，以及加强某些必须加强的部门，如公安工作、税收工作等。各单位应定时完成这一工作。
    第二、厉行简政。取消一切不必要的繁琐的手续。各单位办公必须集中，制度必须科学，领导必须深入，手续必须简单。不必要的会议要尽量减少。
    第三、调整房屋，调整交通工具。各单位要逐渐建立起公共的办公室和公共食堂。除了有眷属的人员外，任何人不得一个人住一间房子。加强公共交通设备。
    第四、反对浪费，节省开支，降低生活水平。省委负责同志，首先自即日起取消小灶中灶，改吃大灶。
    会后，杭市各机关、工厂、学校都立即布置实施。市政府已开始调整机构，仅秘书处、民政局干部即已由一百一十四人减为八十六人，勤杂人员则由一百二十一人减为三十五人，个人的警卫员、通讯员、挑夫，已全部取消。军管会和市政府已取消小灶、中灶伙食，一律改吃大灶。市政府、中共市委员会、公安局、工务局等单位均已订出节约计划，其中电、水等节约办法已开始实行，并已收到相当效果。两浙盐务局职工并发动节约一日食米救济水灾灾民，百余职工共捐出人民币八万二千元及米票一部。杭市青年干部学校学生亦将晚饭改为稀粥，将节省的粮食救灾。
