    Zhengding Huabei University Students
    Go to Shijiazhuang to Study Urban Policy

    [Zhengding News] Students from the Fourth District Team of Huabei University's Zhengding branch went to Shijiazhuang on the 11th of this month to study urban policy and visited factories, courts, the Military and Political University, and other units in Shijiazhuang. Since studying in the rural areas of Sanqiu, the students of the Fourth District Team have undergone major changes in their thinking. After a major ideological self-examination, the students' political awareness has been further improved, and they have actively applied to join the Party and the League. Among the 1,100 comrades in the entire district team, more than 700 have applied to join the League, and more than 80 have applied to join the Party.
    Recently, the new students from the 12th and 13th District Teams who newly arrived in Zhengding from Peiping and Tianjin have completed their study of the "Introduction to Huabei University," and the new students' lives and actions have gradually become disciplined. Their enthusiasm for learning has gradually stabilized. The new students officially began studying the theoretical course "A Brief History of Social Development" on the 11th.

    正定华大同学
    赴石学城市政策
    【正定讯】华大正定分校新四区队同学，于本月十一日去石家庄学习城市政策，并在石市参观工厂、法院、军大等单位。新四区队同学自在三邱农村学习后，在思想上已起了大的转变，经过思想大检讨后，同学们的政治觉悟已提高了一步，纷纷提出入党入团的要求。全区队一千一百同志中，申请入团者已达七百余人，申请入党者已有八十余人。
    最近新由平津到达正定的十二、十三两区队新同学，学习“华大介绍”已告结束，新同学的生活行动方面已逐渐走上纪律化。学习情绪已渐安定。新同学已于十一日起正式开始学习理论课“社会发展简史”。
