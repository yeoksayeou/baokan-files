　　Consolidate Revolutionary Order and Protect People's Interests
    Beiping Carries Out Household Registration Check
  　Masses Actively Assist in Reporting Bandits and Special Agents
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Since the 20th of last month, Beiping has been conducting a general census and verification of household registrations. This verification is being carried out under the unified leadership of the General Bureau, with police stations as the units. It is expected to be completed by the end of this month. During the census, various sub-bureaus discovered unreported households and households that had not been cancelled, including high-ranking Kuomintang secret agents, scattered soldiers, Japanese spies, and individuals with unknown origins, as well as discrepancies in names and occupations. They also discovered enemy and puppet properties that had not yet been sealed off. The above-mentioned individuals and households are being dealt with according to their different circumstances. This sealing work has won praise from the city's people, who believe that this work directly safeguards the lives and property of citizens. Many citizens actively assisted in this work, reporting information to the census groups organized by the Public Security Bureau. The masses in the third section of the sixth sub-bureau reported Liu Shenjiang, a special agent with a gun. Wen Quan'hui (female), a resident of 13th Street, hid her watch and ring under the kang mat and falsely accused the police of stealing them, attempting to damage the reputation of the Public Security Bureau staff. After the truth came to light, the masses expressed their indignation. During the verification, each bureau explained that the purpose of the census was to protect the people's interests and consolidate the revolutionary order, and also carried out publicity on preventing special agents, fire prevention, theft prevention, and sanitation. The citizens all felt that this household registration check was fundamentally different from the Kuomintang era: there was no phenomenon of ransacking things; the police officers' attitudes were mostly serious and amiable. This was mainly the result of each bureau carrying out mobilization and education in advance, and some even strictly formulated codes of conduct for household registration personnel. However, there were still a very few police officers whose methods were still stiff or not responsible enough during inquiries. The initial experience at this stage is that door-to-door census should be combined with key sampling; attention should be paid to cultivating activists in the work, in order to lay a good mass foundation for future work; contact and collect materials from relevant parties should be taken proactively, and the broad masses of citizens should be organized into the census work.

　　巩固革命秩序保障人民利益
    平市普查户口
  　群众积极协助检举匪特
    【本报讯】平市自上月二十日起普查与对正户口。此次查对是在总局统一领导下，以派出所为单位进行的。预计将于本月底结束。普查中各分局均发现了漏报户及未销户，其中包括有国民党高级特务人员、流散军人、日本特务，及来历不明者、名姓职业不符者；并查出了尚未被封闭的敌伪房产。以上各种人户，正按不同情况处理中。此次查封工作，博得了全市人民的好评，认为这一工作是直接维护了市民的生命财产。不少市民积极地协助这一工作，向公安局组织的普查组反映情况。六分局第三段群众检举了有枪特务刘申江；十三街住户温泉惠（女）把手表、戒指藏在炕席下，反诬赖员警偷了，企图以此损害公安局工作人员的声誉，真相大白后，群众咸表激愤。各局在查对中都曾讲解了普查是为了保障人民利益、巩固革命秩序的意旨，并作了防特、防火、防盗、清洁卫生等宣传。市民都感到这次查户口与国民党时期根本不相同：没有乱翻东西的现象；员警态度多是严肃而又和蔼的。这主要是各局在事先都作过动员与教育，有的并严格制订了户籍人员守则的结果。但也还有极少数员警在探询时，方式还显得生硬或不够负责。这一阶段的初步经验是：挨户普查应与重点抽查结合；工作中注意培养积极分子，以打下今后工作的良好群众基础；应主动地向有关方面取得联系和收集材料，把广大市民组织到普查工作中来。（光）
