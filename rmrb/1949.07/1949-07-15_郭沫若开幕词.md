　　【Ping City News】The full text of Guo Moruo's opening speech at the Initiator Meeting of the Chinese Social Science Workers Representative Conference held in Peiping on the 14th:

　　The Initiator Meeting of the Chinese Social Science Workers Representative Conference is now open.

　　Our purpose is to unite all Chinese social science workers to work together for the construction of a new democratic New China. A preparatory committee should be established at today's Initiator Meeting to prepare for the convening of the National Social Science Workers Representative Conference.

　　Today, the representatives of philosophy, history, economics, political science, and law, with Marxism-Leninism as the core, are present. We believe that the establishment of the preparatory committee will definitely proceed smoothly, and at the same time, we can foresee that the future representative conference will also be successfully concluded.

　　The ability of the study of philosophy, history, economics, politics, law, etc., to become science is due to the fact that after Marx and Engels advocated dialectical materialism, researchers in various fields were able to use this doctrine to engage in research.

　　Before this, it was not that there were no academic studies of philosophy, history, economics, politics, law, etc., but they had never reached a truly scientific stage.

　　The ruling class of feudal society, in order to prove the sacredness of the feudal order and the immortality of feudal society, could not be realistic in their research on society, and there was no possibility of achieving scientific status.

　　The Western bourgeoisie overthrew feudal rule, and in order to prove the rationality of the capitalist ruling order and the immortality of capitalist society, they also lost the spirit of seeking truth from facts in their research on society, and finally went to the dead end of anti-science.

　　Since the feudal class and the bourgeoisie had no possibility of establishing a real social science, the mission of establishing a real social science had to fall on the shoulders of the selfless and true creators of the world—the proletariat. Only by standing on the position of the proletariat is there no need to hide the inevitable demise of class society. After overthrowing feudalism and capitalism, the proletariat does not want to establish a new class-exploitative society, but to eliminate all exploitation systems, eliminate all class differences between people, and make human society move from socialism to communism, in order to achieve universal harmony in the world.

　　郭沫若开幕词
    【平市讯】郭沫若在十四日于北平召开的中国社会科学工作者代表会议发起人会议上的开幕词全文：
    中国社会科学工作者代表会议的发起人会议现在开幕了。
    我们的目的是要团结全中国社会科学工作者来共同努力新民主主义新中国的建设，在今天的发起人会议上应该产生一个筹备会，来筹备全国社会科学工作者代表会议的召开。
    今天到会的是以马列主义为核心的哲学、史学、经济学、政治学、法学各部门的代表性的朋友，我们相信筹备会的产生一定能够进行得很顺利，而同时也可以预见到未来的代表会议也一定能够很顺利地得到成功的。
    哲学、历史、经济、政治、法学等的研究之能成为科学，是在马克思、恩格斯倡导了辩证唯物主义之后，各方面的研究工作者们能运用这一主义以从事研究的成果。
    在这之前并不是没有哲学、史学、经济学、政治学、法学等的学术性的研究，但一直是没有达到真正科学化的阶段的。
    封建社会的统治阶级为了要证明封建秩序的神圣，封建社会的永垂不朽，因而他们对于社会的研究便不能实事求是，没有达到科学化的可能。
    西方的资产阶级推翻了封建统治，也为了要证明资本主义统治秩序的合理，资本主义社会的永垂不朽，因而他们对于社会的研究也失掉了实事求是的精神，终于走到反科学的末路去了。
    封建阶级和资产阶级，既没有可能建立真正的社会科学，于是建立真正社会科学的使命便不能不落到大公无私的世界的真正创造者——无产阶级的身上来了。只有站在无产阶级的立场才没有必要去隐瞒阶级社会的必然灭亡。无产阶级在推翻封建主义和资本主义之后，并不是要从新建立一个阶级剥削的社会，而是要消灭一切剥削制度，消灭人与人之间的一切阶级差别，使人类社会由社会主义而共产主义，以达到世界大同。
