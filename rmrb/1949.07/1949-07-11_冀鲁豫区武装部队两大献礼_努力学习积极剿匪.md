[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] The armed forces of the entire Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, with two concrete actions—a fervent study movement and active suppression of bandits—and by implementing the instructions of the Second Plenary Session of our Party's Seventh Central Committee, are presenting a great gift to commemorate the 28th anniversary of the birth of our Party. In terms of study, after the various units completed their study of the situation, armed tasks, and ideological style as proposed by the Second Plenary Session, most have entered the ideological examination phase, launching irreconcilable struggles against various non-proletarian thoughts and consciousness inconsistent with the spirit of the Second Plenary Session. From June 25th to July 1st, the directly subordinate units of the military generally held branch meetings, with everyone expressing to the Party: resolutely accept the instructions of the Second Plenary Session of the Party, forever be a fighting member, resolutely struggle to the end, do a better job of the troop's work, to consolidate the entire rear, guarantee production and construction, and defend the motherland from any imperialist aggression! Currently, this study movement is developing in-depth and normally forward. In terms of clearing out bandits and special agents, under unified arrangements, 862 bandits were annihilated in February, and considerable experience was gained. The Northern Henan Sub-district and the Independent 2nd Brigade each dispatched 100 cadres to form working groups to directly assist in mobilizing the masses locally. Since June 27th, the military region is holding a bandit suppression conference, commending units with achievements one by one; and giving strict criticism to "leftist" and rightist deviations in bandit suppression ideology, as well as certain violations of policies and disciplines.

　　冀鲁豫区武装部队两大献礼
  　努力学习积极剿匪
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫全区武装部队，以两种具体行动——热烈的学习运动和积极剿匪，并贯彻实现我党二中全会的指示，作为对我党诞生廿八周年纪念的伟大献礼。在学习方面，各部在学完了二中全会所提出的形势、武装任务和思想作风等问题后，大部已进入思想检查阶段，对于各种和二中全会精神不一致的非无产阶级的思想、意识，展开了不调和的斗争。从六月二十五日至“七一”止，军直各单位普遍举行了支部大会，人人向党表示：坚决接受党的二中全会的指示，永远作一个战斗队员，坚决奋斗到底，把部队工作做的更好些，以巩固整个后方，保障生产建设，并捍卫祖国不受任何帝国主义者侵犯！目前，这种学习运动正深入正常的向前发展。清剿匪特方面，在统一布置下，二月份共歼匪八百六十二名，并取得不少经验。豫北分区和独二旅，更各抽调一百个干部分别组成工作组，直接到地方上协助发动群众。六月二十七日以来，军区正举行剿匪会议，对有成绩单位一一表扬；对剿匪思想上“左”的和右的偏向，以及某些违犯政策纪律现象，给予严格批评。
