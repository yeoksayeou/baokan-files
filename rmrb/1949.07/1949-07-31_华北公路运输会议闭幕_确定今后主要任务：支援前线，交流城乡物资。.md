　　North China Highway Transportation Conference Concludes
    Primary Tasks Defined: Supporting the Front Lines, Facilitating Urban-Rural Material Exchange.
    [Report from this newspaper] The Mechanical and Vehicle Affairs Conference convened by the North China Highway Transportation Bureau successfully concluded yesterday (the 30th). Feng Yujiu, Deputy Director of the North China Highway Transportation Bureau, delivered a report. In his presentation on the basic situation and understanding of highway transportation in North China, he stated: As the Liberation War achieves fundamental victory nationwide, the highway transportation undertaking will follow the new victorious situation and accept new tasks. To liberate all of China, our primary task remains to support the front lines. Simultaneously, as North China enters the construction phase, the transportation undertaking will play a significant role in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas to build a new democratic economy. Although there are numerous difficulties and the tasks are arduous and complex, North China's highways have established a preliminary foundation: We have twelve directly affiliated and regional companies, sixty-eight transit stations, thirty-five bus routes, and a road length of five thousand and sixty-one kilometers, connecting the major cities and towns of North China into an incomplete highway network. We have a total of one thousand and sixteen automobiles, six hundred and thirty-four horse-drawn carriages, and two hundred and ninety-seven iron-wheeled carts. The total transportation capacity of the companies has reached two thousand six hundred and one tons. The capacity for major and minor repairs has developed to five hundred and thirty-five vehicles per month. There are sixty-two main machines and a total of one hundred and fifty repair machines and instruments. As a result of our arduous struggle, we have initially established this foundation, but this foundation is still weak and requires continued effort to play a backbone leading role in the people's transportation undertaking.

　　华北公路运输会议闭幕
    确定今后主要任务：支援前线，交流城乡物资。
    【本报讯】华北公路运输总局所召开的机务车务会议，于昨（三十）日胜利闭幕。华北公路运输总局冯于九副局长做作论报告。在他提出华北公路运输的基本情况与认识时称：由于解放战争在全国获得基本胜利，公路运输事业将跟着新的胜利形势，接受新任务。为要解放全中国，我们的主要任务还是支援前线，同时在华北进入建设阶段之际，运输事业在城乡物资交流中将起相当大的作用，来建设新民主主义经济。虽然目前困难多端，任务艰苦复杂，但华北公路已建立初步基础：我们直属与区公司有十二个，运转站六十八个，班车路线三十五条，路长五千零六十一公里，已把华北主要的大中小城市联成一个不完整的公路网。我们共有汽车一千零十六辆，马车六百三十四辆，铁轮车二百九十七辆，各公司的总运输力已达二千六百零一吨，大小修理能力每月已发展到五百三十五部，母机共六十二具，修理机器与仪器共有一百五十具，由于我们艰苦奋斗的结果，我们已初步有了这点基础，但这个基础还是薄弱的，须要继续努力，在人民运输事业里起骨干带头作用。
