    Organizes Unemployed Workers to Produce Carpets for Export
    [Tianjin News] The Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in conjunction with export trade, is organizing unemployed workers to produce carpets. Currently, due to insufficient manpower and lack of leadership experience, the main focus is on planned and step-by-step pilot projects. In June, a total of thirty-one male worker carpet groups were formed, each group with one loom and four workers. In addition, there was one female worker carpet group with eleven workers and five looms. The cooperative borrowed more than 8.7 million yuan from the People's Bank Cooperative Department to buy 20,000 jin of wool yarn to supply as raw materials to each group. The male worker groups are expected to produce sixteen carpets next month, totaling more than 1,700 square feet.
    During the organization, meetings were held to discuss the production system and establish groups. The workers are all cooperative members, each with a share of 30 jin of corn flour, which will be deducted from wages in two installments. Currently, each group is supplied with raw materials by the cooperative, which recovers the finished products according to standards. The wage is 11 jin of corn flour per square foot, plus a factory fee (rent, tools, electricity, etc.) of 1 jin, which is paid in two installments per month according to the amount of work completed.
    After being organized, everyone's morale is very high. The finished products exceeded the acceptance standards, with each square foot having 88 to 90 warps and over 56 wefts per foot. They can weave 8 to 13 inches per day. Many carpet businesses have said that the carpets that have been woven are very good. In the future, quality will be further improved.

　　天津供销总社
    组织失业工人生产地毯出口
    【天津讯】津市供销合作总社，结合出口贸易组织失业工人，进行地毯生产。目前因力量不足和领导经验缺乏，主要是有计划有步骤的重点试办，在六月份里共已组成三十一个男工地毯小组，每组机子一架，工人四人：另外还有一个女工地毯小组，工人十一人，机子五架。总社向人民银行合作部借到八百七十多万元，买了二万斤毛线，供给各小组作原料。男工小组预计下月初可出地毯十六块，计一千七百多方尺。
    在组织时，召开会议讨论生产制度，成立小组。工人都是社员，每人股金玉米面三十斤，该股金由工资内分两期扣除交清。目前各小组均由总社供给原料，按标准收回成品，每方尺工资玉米面十一斤，外加厂费（房租、工具、电灯费等）一斤，每月按活分两期付给。
    组织起来后，大家情绪都很高。成品超过了收件标准，每方尺经线上到八十八至九十个头，纬线每尺织到五十六遭以上，每天可织八寸到十三寸。已织出的地毯，很多地毯行都说很不错。今后当更进一步提高质量。
