    [Tangshan Dispatch] The cotton-producing areas of Fengrun (newly established county), Yutian, and Xianghe counties have planted a total of over 180,000 mu of cotton this year. These three counties all have the custom of topdressing cotton (applying fertilizer).

The regulations for this loan are as follows: 1. All of it should be used for fertilizing cotton, with plans to use this batch of loans to topdress 23,000 mu; 2. Priority should be given to disaster-stricken households in severely affected areas; 3. Loans should be issued in kind as much as possible, but should be combined with trade, preparing soybean cakes, bone meal, etc., according to local needs to prevent waste of loans; 4. Guarantee that the season is not missed, conduct in-depth investigations to understand and issue loans immediately, and complete all loans before July 14th. Currently, the county banks are actively proceeding with the help of the government.
