Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 18th: TASS, New York, 16th: Official and non-official statistics released this week indicate that the economic situation in the United States continues to deteriorate. The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates that steel production in June was 6,500,001 tons, the lowest record in more than a year, a decrease of 1.9 million tons compared to March. In the coal mining industry, the National Coal Mining Union estimates that the total production of bituminous coal in the week ending July 9 was only 4,880,000 tons, while it was 9,841,100 tons in the same week last year. The volume of train freight, which is generally considered to be an accurate "barometer" of the entire economy, also continues to decline. The American Railway Association estimates that the volume of train freight in the week ending July 9 decreased by 21.2% compared to the same week last year. As production decreases, unemployment, especially in the manufacturing industry, continues to increase. The Electrical and Radio Workers' Union issued a statement to the press again accusing the government's Census Bureau of underestimating unemployment figures. The union estimates that total unemployment in June was 5.4 million, an increase of 600,000 compared to May and an increase of 2.1 million compared to the same month last year. The situation of farmers is even worse, because "surplus" agricultural products flood the market, depressing the prices farmers receive from selling agricultural products. On July 9, the Department of Agriculture estimated that farmers' cash income in the first half of this year decreased by 1.3 billion yuan compared to the first half of 1948. The increase in unemployment and the decrease in farmers' income continue to shrink the domestic market. The Federal Reserve Board reported that in the week ending July 9, department store sales decreased by 7% compared to the same week last year. In New York, the decrease was 11%. The decrease in production and sales has increased the number of business failures. According to Dun & Bradstreet, in the week ending July 7, 153 businesses (including 73 retail companies) went bankrupt, almost twice as many as in the same week last year.

    美经济情势继续恶化
    六月产钢较三月份减少四分之一弱
    六月失业人数比五月增加六十万人
    企业倒闭数目较去年同周几增一倍
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：本周发表的官方与非官方的统计数字，表明美国的经济局势继续恶化。美国钢铁研究所估计：六月份的钢产量为六百五十万零一千吨，为一年多以来的最低纪录，比三月份减少了一百九十万吨。在煤矿工业方面，全国煤矿联合会估计：至七月九日为止的一周中，烟煤总生产量只有四百八十八万吨，而去年同周却为九百八十四万一千吨。一般认为是整个经济的准确“气压计”的火车运货量，也继续下降。美国铁路联合会估计：至七月九日为止的一周中，火车货运量比去年同周减少了百分之二十一·二。当生产减少时，失业人数，特别在制造工业部门中，却在继续增加，电气及无线电工人工会向报界发表的声明，再度指责政府的人口普查局过低估计失业数字，该工会估计六月份的失业总数为五百四十万，比五月份增加了六十万，比去年同月增加了二百一十万。农民的情况更加恶化，因为“生产过剩”的农产品充斥市场，压低了农民出售农产品所得的价格。七月九日，农业部估计本年上半年度农民的现款收入比一九四八年上半年度减少了十三亿元。失业的增加和农民收入的减少，继续紧缩着国内市场。联邦准备局报告：在至七月九日为止的一周中，百货公司的销售量比去年同周减少了百分之七。在纽约则减少了百分之十一。生产与销售的减少，增加了企业倒闭的数目。据邓·布列斯特统计所报告：至七月七日为止的一周中，有一百五十三家企业（其中包括七十三家零售公司）破产，较去年同周几乎多了一倍。
