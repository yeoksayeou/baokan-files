Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 22nd: TASS, Washington, July 21st: Senator Taylor, the Progressive Party's vice-presidential candidate in the last U.S. election, spoke in the Senate against the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty, arguing that it violates the United Nations Charter, intensifies the arms race, and constitutes an attack on peace. Taylor urged the Senate not to be influenced by artificially created panic and opposed the government's practice of submitting serious and significant issues to the Senate as faits accomplis. Taylor demanded the replacement of those representatives on the U.S. delegation to the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference who had suggested keeping the American people in a state of artificial terror. He said, "Unless this is done, no American citizen or senator can believe that he is not being blinded by artificially manufactured sinister crises and deceptive propaganda. This propaganda is Goebbels-like in its insidious and despicable nature." After pointing out that the North Atlantic Treaty would create an arms race and increase the danger of war, Taylor ridiculed Vandenberg and Connally for their deceitful actions in the Senate. Taylor pointed out that, contrary to Connally's assurances, ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty would obligate the United States to arm Western European countries and would lead to spending countless sums of money on arms procurement. Taylor further said: the government, in view of the possibility that workers in European countries might refuse to manufacture weapons in their own countries and factories, is undertaking the responsibility of arming Europe. Taylor pointed out that this measure is futile, saying: if the workers in these countries are unwilling to manufacture weapons, can their soldiers—after all, mostly workers in uniform—be relied upon to use the weapons to fight the Soviet Union? Taylor then turned to discuss U.S. economic policy, saying: although our business community is clamoring for the promotion of surplus exports, we are still restricting trade with the only country that can exchange valuable goods for our exports—the Soviet Union. Taylor concluded by saying that he favored building American policy on the foundation of the United Nations, rather than on military alliances that lead to destructive wars.

　　泰勒在美参院发言
  　反对批准侵略公约
  　斥美帝妄想制造战争危机
    【新华社北平二十二日电】塔斯社华盛顿二十一日讯：去年美国大选中的进步党副总统候选人、参议员泰勒在参院发言，反对批准北大西洋公约，认为它违反联合国宪章，加剧军备竞赛，并且是对和平的攻击。泰勒要求参院不要受人工制造的惊慌的影响，并反对政府把严肃而重大的问题当作既成事实提交参院的做法。泰勒要求撤换美国出席巴黎外长会议代表团中那些曾建议将美国人民保持在人为惊恐中的代表们。他说：“除非做到这一点，任何一个美国公民或参议员都不能够相信他自己没有被人工制造的凶恶危机与迷惑宣传所蒙蔽。这种宣传是戈培尔式的阴险卑劣的宣传。”泰勒在指出北大西洋公约将造成军备竞赛并加重战争危险之后，嘲笑范登堡与康纳利在参院中颠倒是非的作为。泰勒指出：与康纳利的保证相反，批准北大西洋公约将使美国承担武装西欧国家的义务，而且将导向花费无数金钱来购置军备。泰勒又说：政府鉴于欧洲国家的工人可能拒绝在他们国内和工厂内制造武器，乃承担武装欧洲的责任。泰勒指出这一举措是徒劳的，他说：如果这些国家的工人不愿制造武器，难道它们的士兵——毕竟大部分是穿起军装的工人，就靠得住会使用武器来打苏联么？泰勒转而论述美国的经济政策说：尽管我国企业界人士喊叫着要求推销过剩的输出品，但是对于唯一的可以用有价值的物品来换取我国输出的国家——苏联，我们却仍然在限制对她的贸易。泰勒结语说：他赞成将美国政策建筑在联合国的基础上，而不是建筑在牵入破坏性战争的军事联盟的基础上。
