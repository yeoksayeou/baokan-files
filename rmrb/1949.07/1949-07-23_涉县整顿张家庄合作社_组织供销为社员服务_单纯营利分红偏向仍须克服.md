[Taihang Electric] The Zhangjiazhuang Cooperative in the Fourth District of She County underwent further rectification in May of this year and is now able to provide supply and marketing services to its members in a more organized and planned manner. After the rectification last autumn, the cooperative clarified the direction of organizing mass production and paid attention to supply and marketing operations. In the past ten months, it has sold more than 8,000 jin of edible salt, more than 10,000 chi of native cloth, 880 jin of cotton, 782 chi of foreign cloth, more than 4,000 boxes of matches, 121 large and small pots, and paper, writing brushes, and iron nails to the masses. It has also sold medicines, *chaihu* (Bupleurum root), peach kernels, etc., on behalf of the masses. However, due to the lack of connection with the state-owned economy, the cooperative did not distinguish between members and non-members in its business operations, and the tendency towards simple profit-seeking and dividend distribution has not been thoroughly corrected, so it has not yet organized small producers. In response to this situation, the She County Party Committee sent personnel to help the cooperative conduct research and transformation. This transformation work has now made preliminary achievements in the following three aspects: 1. Relying on the Party branch to mobilize the masses and transform the cooperative. The first problem encountered in this transformation of the cooperative was the lack of confidence among cooperative cadres, Party members, and the masses in transforming the village cooperative. Accordingly, on the one hand, the achievements of the cooperative were affirmed within the Party, and the mistakes of the cooperative were criticized. The Party's current policies and guidelines for running cooperatives were discussed; on the other hand, a barter contract was signed with the Yutai Goods Station of the trade company. The cooperative supplied 3,000 jin of *chaihu* to the Yutai Goods Station, and Yutai supplied 1,700 jin of edible salt to the cooperative, at a price of 20 yuan (Renminbi) per *jin*, which was lower than the market price; the price of *chaihu* was 24 yuan, which was also fair, allowing the farmers to initially receive help from the cooperative. After these two preparatory tasks were completed, all Party members carried out propaganda work, explaining the future direction of the cooperative to the masses, mobilizing the masses to invest in the cooperative, clearing outstanding debts, and specifically organizing the masses to dig medicinal materials. After these tasks, the masses generally believed: "If this is the case, the cooperative is good, and it is beneficial to be a member." More than 100 people joined the cooperative (there are now more than 900 members), the capital stock has grown to more than 10 million, and 3.5 million in outstanding debts has been cleared. 2. The equity system between the cooperative and its members was established. In the past, most members of the village cooperative invested in shares as households, and the amount of capital stock was not balanced. When the cooperative distributed dividends based on profits in the past, there was not much of a problem for such members to distribute dividends based on shares. Now, when implementing commodity distribution (members have preferential treatment), the problem arises that those with more capital stock and fewer people suffer losses, while those with less capital stock and more people benefit. In order to solve this problem, a members' meeting was held to discuss and determine that: the capital stock for each person to enjoy preferential treatment is 20,000 yuan. For each person whose capital stock exceeds 20,000 yuan, the remaining capital stock, the cooperative can give dividend treatment from the profits obtained from selling the remaining materials to non-members at market prices; if the capital stock is less than 20,000 yuan per person on average, it will be calculated at 20,000 yuan, enjoying preferential treatment without dividend. After such reorganization, there are 58 people with capital stock above 50,000 yuan, and 115 people with 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, these two types of people account for about one-fifth of the members; 758 people with capital stock below 30,000 yuan need to be given preferential purchase treatment, this type of people accounts for the majority of the members. The cooperative also decided that the business policy is: distribute first, then sell; first meet the living needs of members, then meet the requirements for dividends. Although the capital stock of most members is small, their labor is abundant. They allow the cooperative to sell products on their behalf, so the cooperative can charge more handling fees and also control physical objects to exchange for favorable materials, which is also beneficial to those with more capital stock. After this method was determined, the member certificates were discussed. The member certificate indicates: the number of people in the member's family, the standard for distributing edible salt, native cloth, and other items per person, as the basis for the distribution quantity; and indicates the number of surplus labor, so that the cooperative can find production avenues. In the past forty days, 3,503 jin of edible salt have been distributed. 3. The cooperative's business scope and economic procedures have been stipulated. In order to limit credit and avoid losses to the cooperative due to price fluctuations, it was determined that the credit price is the system of settling accounts upon repayment, rising with the increase and not falling with the decrease.

Editor's note: The rectification of the Zhangjiazhuang Cooperative in She County, from the method point of view, relies on the Party branch to mobilize the masses and closely combines it with solving specific business problems, helping the village cooperative sign a contract with the trade company to purchase *chaihu* and supply edible salt, thereby organizing and mobilizing the masses to carry out the production of digging medicinal materials. This method is worth introducing.

However, if we examine it from the policy point of view, there is a fundamental bias. For example, after the rectification of the cooperative, it stipulated that the capital stock for each person to enjoy preferential treatment is 20,000 yuan (Jibi currency, same below), but for the part of the capital stock exceeding 20,000 yuan, dividend treatment is given from the profits obtained from selling to non-members at market prices, and it is stipulated that distribution comes first, then selling, first meeting the living needs of members, then meeting the requirements for dividends. This clearly shows that the cooperative is still implementing "dividend distribution" and "transactions with non-members." This approach is contrary to the new policy of "no dividend distribution" and "no transactions with non-members." This will make the simple pursuit of profit tendency existing in some cooperatives still unable to be effectively and thoroughly corrected, and will make the cooperative still unable to avoid the capitalist road. Recently, it has been learned that similar biases have also occurred in some areas. Therefore, in addition to suggesting that the Taihang District Party and government leading organs should pay attention to inspection and appropriate correction, other places should also pay close attention and try to transform the old cooperatives in accordance with the new policy.

### 涉县整顿张家庄合作社  组织供销为社员服务  单纯营利分红偏向仍须克服

　　涉县整顿张家庄合作社
  　组织供销为社员服务
    单纯营利分红偏向仍须克服
    【太行电】涉县四区张家庄合作社，今年五月进一步进行了整顿，已能较有组织有计划地为社员供销服务。该社去秋整顿后，明确了组织群众生产的方向，注意了供销业务，十个月来售给群众食盐八千多斤，土布一万余尺，棉花八百八十斤，洋布七百八十二尺，火柴四千多盒，大小锅一百二十一口，及纸张、毛笔、铁钉等。代群众推销药材、柴胡、桃仁等。但因为缺乏与国营经济的联系，营业中社员与非社员不分，单纯营利分红的偏向还没有得到彻底的纠正，所以还没有把小生产者组织起来。针对这种情况、涉县县委特派人帮助该社进行研究改造。这个改造工作，现已在以下三个问题上作出初步成绩：一、依靠党的支部，发动群众，改造合作社。这次改造合作社，首先遇到的问题是合作干部及党员群众对改造村社缺乏信心。据此，一面在党内肯定了合作社的成绩，批判了合作社的错误，又讨论了党目前办理合作社的方针政策；一面即与贸易公司裕太货栈签订了换货合同，合作社以三千斤柴胡供给裕太货栈，裕太供给合作社一千七百斤食盐，每价斤二十元（人民币），低于市价；柴胡价二十四元，也较公道，使农民初步得到了合作社的帮助。做好了这两件准备工作以后，全体党员又进行了宣传工作，向群众说明今后合作社方向，发动群众向合作社入股，清理外欠，并具体的组织了群众刨药材。经过了这些工作，群众普遍的认为：要是这样，合作社就是好，当个社员就是有利。又有百多人入了社（现有社员九百多），股金发展到一千余万，外欠清理了三百五十万。二、创建了合作社与社员的股权制度。过去该村社员大部是以户为单位入股的，股金多少也不平衡，过去合作社以营利分红时，这样的社员按股分红并无多大问题，现在实行商品配售时（社员有优待），即产生了股金多人口少的吃亏，而股金少人口多的讨便宜的问题。为解决这个问题，召开了社员大会，讨论确定为：每人享受优待的股金为二万元，每人股金超出二万元者，剩余股金，合作社可在按市价配售剩余物资给非社员所得利润中，给以分红的待遇；股金每人平均不及二万元者，按二万元计算，享受优待不分红。经这样的整理后，股金在五万元以上者五十八名，三万元至五万元者一百一十五名，这两种人约占社员的五分之一；三万元以下股金者七百五十八名，须给以购货优待，这种人占社员的大多数。合作社又决定经营方针是：先配售，后出卖；先满足社员生活需要，后满足分红要求。虽然多数社员的股金是少的，但劳力是多的，他们让合作社代售产品，合作社既可多抽手续费，也能掌握实物换回有利物资，对股金多者，也有利。这个办法确定后，即讨论了社员证，在社员证上填明：社员家庭人口，每口人配售的食盐、土布等物品的标准，作为配售数量的根据；并填明劳力剩余数，以便合作社给找生产门路。最近四十多天，已配售了食盐三千五百零三斤。三、规定了合作社的经营范围与经济手续。为限制赊欠，避免物价波动给合作社的损失，确定了赊欠价格是还钱结帐，随涨不随落的制度。
   编者按：涉县张家庄合作社的整顿，从方法上看，是依靠党的支部发动群众，并紧紧与解决具体业务问题相结合，帮助该村合作社与贸易公司签定收买柴胡，供给食盐的合同，从而组织与发动群众进行刨药材生产。这种方法是值得介绍的。
    但如从方针上去检查则存有基本偏向。如该社整顿后规定了每人享受优待股金为二万元（冀钞下同），但超出二万元之股金部分，在按市价卖给非社员所得利润中给以分红待遇，并规定先配售、后出卖，先满足社员生活需要，后满足分红要求，这明显说明该社仍施行“分红”“作非社员交易”，这种作法与“不分红”、“不作非社员交易”的新方针相违背的，这样会使某些合作社存在的单纯追逐利润偏向，仍不能有效与彻底的纠正，并将使合作社仍不能避开资本主义道路。最近据了解有的地区也有类似偏向的发生，因此除建议太行区党政领导机关应注意检查、适当纠正外，其他各地也应很好提起注意，按照新方针去试行改造旧社。
