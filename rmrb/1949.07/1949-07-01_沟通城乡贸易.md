　　Connecting Urban and Rural Trade

Connecting urban and rural trade, enabling the exchange of industrial and agricultural products, is an important prerequisite for restoring and developing production, and it is necessary for both urban and rural people. This point, through Chairman Mao's instruction of the policy of taking all sectors into consideration, is becoming increasingly clear in the minds of our economic workers. However, the state of separation between urban and rural areas caused by the long-term war cannot be completely overcome in a short period of time, resulting in continued difficulties for urban industries in terms of raw materials and sales, and some rural raw material crops cannot be effectively utilized or exchanged for farm tools and necessities. Therefore, promoting unimpeded urban and rural trade is one of the central issues on the current economic front.

The restoration of urban and rural trade now possesses basic favorable conditions. This is because not only the vast countryside, but also most cities, have been liberated, and the past situation of division and antagonism between cities and the countryside has been broken. The villages in the old liberated areas, after eight years of the War of Resistance and land reform, have a high degree of trust in the Communist Party and the People's Government, and most areas have entered an environment of peaceful construction. Many liberated cities are gradually being transformed from consumer cities under the rule of Japanese and Kuomintang bureaucrats and comprador reactionaries into production cities. Under these circumstances, urban and rural trade is bound to develop. However, because cities have long been the center of reactionary rule by imperialists and their running dog Kuomintang bureaucrats and compradors, and the organism that sucked the blood of workers and peasants, it spread the enslaved idea of ​​despising "country bumpkins," causing resentment among the peasants. At the same time, due to the long-term division between urban and rural areas, lack of interaction, and lack of information, most of the original business and trade systems were fragmented, making it difficult for cities and villages to understand each other's production and needs. This has created many difficulties for urban and rural trade. It is necessary to overcome difficulties, break down urban-rural barriers, increase mutual understanding, and restore normal trade relations in order to truly achieve urban-rural exchange.

To connect urban and rural trade, on the urban side, in addition to developing state-owned commerce and systematically and steadily establishing truly mass-based supply and marketing cooperatives with centralized leadership, under current conditions, many places must fully utilize legitimate private commerce, encourage merchants to go to the countryside to sell and purchase goods, and provide active business guidance to merchants who go to the countryside to do business. They should be told that the rural areas of the liberated areas after the land reform have gradually gotten rid of ignorance and backwardness, and the peasants are the masters of their own land. They should do fair and reasonable transactions with the peasants, and they are not allowed to use the old methods of oppressing, deceiving, and exploiting so-called "country bumpkins" by profiteering, exploiting, and plundering. The latter method is no longer feasible. Even if one temporarily speculates and takes petty advantages, one will inevitably bring failure upon oneself. At the same time, they should also be told about the production and supply and demand situation of both urban and rural areas, so that they know which transactions are profitable and beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and guide them to operate in these areas. On the rural side, peasants, especially district and village cadres, should be educated that many cities today are our own, and they are under the jurisdiction of the People's Government. The people's cities not only serve the urban people, but also serve the rural people. We should help farmers organize good supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase farmers' produce and supply farmers' necessities at reasonable prices. We should adopt a positive attitude towards merchants who come to the countryside to do business. We must prevent the deception and extortion of unscrupulous merchants, but we should adopt a cooperative attitude towards the legitimate commercial activities of legitimate merchants in promoting industrial finished products and purchasing raw materials and export materials.

In order to restore and develop urban and rural trade, it is necessary to carry out much arduous organizational work and create many convenient conditions for farmers to enter cities and merchants to go to the countryside to conduct transactions. It is necessary to restore transportation, such as establishing and developing urban and rural telecommunications and postal services, so as to be rapid and reliable, so as to exchange commercial information, understand the supply and demand conditions of both urban and rural areas, and eliminate and reduce blindness in industrial and agricultural production and business and trade; build railways, highways, and roads, and dredge inland river shipping, so as to facilitate travel and freight; dredge the original business systems and relations, restore and establish trade networks, so that urban industrial products can radiate to the countryside, and rural raw materials can also be absorbed into the cities through these trade networks. Many cities have established farmer service agencies, reception stations, etc. to help farmers sell agricultural products, order farm tools and necessities, and provide farmers with a place to rest and take care of their lives when they enter the city. This method is very good and should be promoted. At the same time, for merchants who go to the countryside to purchase goods, they should not only not be embarrassed when they depart, travel, and arrive at their destination, but should also be given necessary convenience and assistance. In addition, agricultural product and industrial product exhibitions can be organized, and representatives of farmers, manufacturers, and cooperatives can be invited to exchange information and opinions on urban and rural production and trade to promote urban and rural exchanges. Only by taking all necessary steps, connecting urban and rural relations, and developing inland trade, can our industrial and agricultural production prosper on the basis of self-reliance.

### 沟通城乡贸易

　　沟通城乡贸易
    沟通城乡贸易，使工农业产品相互交流，是恢复和发展生产的重要前提，对城乡人民同属必要。这一点，经毛主席四面八方政策的指示，在我们经济工作人员的思想上是日渐明确起来了。但是，由于长期战争所造成的城乡隔阂状态一时不易完全克服，致使城市工业仍有原料和销路上的困难，而乡村中的某些原料作物也不能有效地得到利用，并换取农具和必需品。因此，促使城乡贸易畅通无阻，乃是当前经济战线上的中心问题之一。
    恢复城乡贸易，现在已经具备了基本的有利条件。因为不仅广大乡村，而且大部分城市，都已解放，过去那种城市和乡村的分割和对立局面业已打破。老解放区的乡村，经过八年抗战和土地改革，对共产党和人民政府有很高的信任，并且大部分地区都已进入和平建设的环境。许多已解放城市，则正在由日本和国民党统治时代的消费城市逐步地被改造为生产城市。在这种情况下，城乡贸易是一定会发展起来的。但是，由于城市曾经长期地是帝国主义及其走狗国民党官僚、买办反动统治的中心，和吮吸工人、农民膏血的机体，散布着瞧不起“乡下人”的奴化思想，引起了农民的反感。同时，也由于城乡长期分割，不相往返，不通情报，原有经商贸易系统大多支离破碎，使得城市和乡村之间互相不了解对方的出产和需要。这就给城乡贸易造成了重重困难。必须克服困难，打破城乡隔阂，增加相互间的了解，恢复正常的贸易关系，才能真正做到城乡交流。
    沟通城乡贸易，在城市方面，除了发展国营商业，并有计划地稳步地建立真正群众性的、有集中领导的供销合作社外，在目前条件下，许多地方必须充分地利用正当的私营商业，鼓励商人下乡贩卖和采办货物，并对下乡经商的商人，进行业务上的积极的指导。应该告诉他们：经过土地改革后的解放区农村，已经逐渐摆脱愚昧和落后状态，农民是自己土地上的主人，应该和农民做公平合理的买卖，不允许采取旧的欺压、愚弄所谓“乡下人”的手段，重利盘剥，巧取豪夺。后一种方法，现在已经是行不通的了，即或一时投机取巧，占些小便宜，但总必使自己招致失败。同时，也还要告诉他们城乡双方出产和供需情况，使他们知道那些买卖有利可图并对国计民生有利，引导他们向这些方面经营。在乡村方面，应该教育农民，首先是区村干部，许多城市今天都是我们自己的了，它同在人民政府的管辖之下，人民的城市不仅为城市人民服务，而且也为乡村人民服务。应当帮助农民组织良好的供销合作社，以合理的价格收买农民的生产品并供给农民的必需品。应当对下乡做买卖的商人采取积极态度，对于奸商的欺骗敲诈必须防止，而对于正当商人推销工业成品及采购原料和出口物资的正当商业行为，则应当采取合作态度。
    为着恢复和发展城乡贸易，必须进行许多艰苦的组织工作，创造许多农民入城和商人下乡进行买卖的方便条件。必须恢复交通，如建立和发展城乡间的电讯、邮政，做到迅速确实，以便互通商业情报，了解城乡双方供需状况，消除和减少工农业生产和经商贸易方面的盲目性；修筑铁路、公路、大路，疏浚内河航运，便利行旅和货运；疏通原有的经商系统和关系，恢复和建立贸易网，使城市的工业产品能向乡村辐射，而乡村的原料物资也能经由这些贸易网源源吸收到城市里来。许多城市已经设立了农民服务社、招待栈等，帮助农民出售农产品，订购农具和必需品，并使农民进城有了歇脚的地方，得到生活上的照顾，这种办法很好，应该推广。同时，对于下乡办货的商人，在他出发当时、行旅途中和到达目的地以后，不但不应留难，而且应该予以必要的方便和协助。此外，还可组织农产品和工业品的展览，邀集农民、厂商和合作社的代表座谈，交换关于城乡生产贸易的情况和意见，以促进城乡交流。只有采取种种必要的步骤，沟通城乡关系，发展内地贸易，我们的工农业生产才能在自力更生的基础上繁荣起来。
