　　Railway Engineering Corps Fully Repairs Roads to Support the Front
  　Rush Repairs on the Pinghan, Yuehan, and Longhai Railways
    Train Service Between Zhengzhou and Hankou to Open Soon
    [Special Dispatch] The Railway Engineering Corps units are doing their utmost to rush repairs on the Jinpu, Pinghan, Yuehan, and Longhai Railways, actively supporting the front lines. The First Detachment accepted the task of repairing the section of the Beining Line between Qinhuangdao and Beiping on February 4th. By May 9th, 405 kilometers of railway line and 20 bridges of various sizes had been repaired. The train speed reached 60 to 90 kilometers per hour, more than double the speed before the repairs. This detachment was fully concentrated in Luoyang in early June. After a short period of rest and reorganization, they actively rushed to repair the railway line and bridges between Luoyang and Guanyintang. Construction began on June 26th, and two bridges have already been built. They are now transporting materials and actively rushing to repair the line. The Second Detachment in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway began construction on the section between Yancheng and Daliuzhuang on April 23rd. This section has a total length of 57 kilometers, with 84 bridges and culverts of various sizes. Although the railway line is not long, the number of bridges and culverts exceeds any railway line the detachment has repaired in the past. There is an average of one and a half bridges and culverts per kilometer. This area is close to the Tongbai Mountains, where mountain floods occur every year and the water is very fierce. In order to complete this arduous task, the detachment party committee called on all party members to lead the masses, urgently mobilize, work day and night, and fully support the field army's operations on the front line to liberate our southern compatriots as soon as possible. The detachment leaders also proposed that all personnel must participate in on-site work, and all vehicles and horses must be concentrated for use on the site. After a month and a half of hard work, all tasks were completed by June 9th. From June 12th to July 6th, the detachment rushed to repair the Shihe and Huaihe large iron bridges. The detachment has now been ordered to cross the river with the newly established Fifth Detachment to rush to repair the Yuehan Railway. The Third Detachment on the Jinpu Line, after successfully repairing the historically significant Huaihe large iron bridge, was ordered to proceed to the western section of the Longhai Line to rush repair the 320-meter-long Luohe Iron Bridge, and jointly with the First Detachment, is responsible for completing the task of repairing the railway lines and bridges between Luoyang and Tongguan. The Fourth Detachment completed the repair work of the Dong (guang) Ji (nan) section of the railway line on June 5th. The current maximum speed has reached 54 kilometers. The bridge project of the De (zhou) Ji (nan) section was fully repaired on the 10th of this month, totaling 89 bridges and culverts (bridges over ten meters). The detachment will rush to repair the 333-kilometer railway line between Shijiazhuang and Xinxiang in the central section of the Pinghan Railway, and 452 bridges and culverts of various sizes (including 72 large bridges over ten meters) by the end of this month. The First Road Construction Engineering Office of the Railway Engineering Corps began construction of the railway line and bridges between Baoding and Shijiazhuang on June 2nd, and passed Wangdu Station on the evening of the 16th, completing one-quarter of the entire project. The entire Railway Engineering Corps commanders, fighters, and technical workers have persisted in hard work on the site for a long time, ensuring the rapid opening of traffic on the Beining, Jinpu, Pinghu, and Zhengzhou-Hankou lines. The people of the whole country are not only amazed by their great achievements, but also place high hopes on them for opposing imperialism's blockade against us, strengthening railway transportation, and completing the state and people's transportation undertakings.
