　　On the Road of Learning
    Kang Zhuo
    I stayed in the rural areas of Hebei and Shanxi for ten years. Because of my love for literature and art, I jumped out of middle school and ran to the Literature Department of Lu Xun Academy of Art in Yan'an to study. After arriving behind enemy lines, although my main focus was not on creation, but on mass work, dealing with land issues and production, running rural drama troupes, compiling popular newspapers and periodicals, and doing general propaganda and education work, it was both busy and complicated; but I didn't completely forget to study writing, and I also squeezed in time during the tense battles and busy work, writing a few hundred words today, and then a thousand words after ten days and a half month, or even three or five months. I pieced together some short stories and novels reflecting farmers. Thinking about the past ten years, I haven't made any achievements in creation, and I haven't systematically thought about the issue of combining literature and art with workers, peasants, and soldiers; however, thinking about the process of my own thoughts and feelings gradually changing and being transformed over the years, it seems that I have learned something.

    I remember in 1938 and 1939, when I started learning to write, I unconsciously felt that I should write about farmers and soldiers, so I paid attention to their lives, recorded their language, and was particularly enthusiastic about collecting their stories, imagining and fabricating them, and writing them into novels or sketches; but did what I wrote resemble farmers? Not only did I not have confidence, but I was also very frightened, and quickly felt that those things had no vitality, no weight, and were not satisfactory. What to do? I thought maybe I wasn't going deep enough! So at the end of 1939 and the beginning of 1940, I decided to "go deep" for a while. Although I was working in the drama troupe, I often went into the villages to chat with farmers, participate in meetings, and my attitude wasn't entirely for collecting materials, sometimes I also gave them ideas for their work; in this way, not only was I attracted by the lives and language of the farmers, but I was also shocked by the power of the farmers! At this time, the language, life, and interests of the several stories and scripts I wrote were different, but that was mainly "exoticism," and what troubled me was: the farmers talked about work, discussed problems, and spoke about the principles of resisting Japan, which were easy to understand; but why were they so enthusiastic about resisting Japan? Why were some lagging behind? I couldn't figure it out! Especially the farmers' family affairs, the complex relationships between relatives, what a woman who doesn't go out all day is busy with, and the complex struggle between landlords and peasants that can't be heard or seen by ears and eyes, these were even more confusing. I thought, it would be difficult to figure these out in the drama troupe, so I went to do mass work.

    In mass organizations, I slowly learned some policies, and I also learned about the overall situation from listening to reports. When I went to the countryside to inspect work, I often discovered some "strange stories"; although I mainly engaged in the cultural and educational work of farmers, I already felt enlightened, and I was very interested in my work, but I looked at collecting materials and recording language indifferently and even stopped doing it. Sometimes I squeezed in time to write something, and I began to consider and try to use the language of the masses entirely, not only the dialogue in the works, but also the narration and description; the content was also intended to deeply reflect the lives of the farmers as much as possible. However, this was only writing about life details, and I didn't pay attention to learning from folk literature and art at all, especially since I often only wrote things from the emotion, excitement, and impulse I received from the lives of farmers with the enthusiasm of a petty-bourgeois intellectual, so the works always mixed unhealthy and unsimple things. How could I deeply write about farmers like this? Where could I completely solve the language problem? Although two of them were said to be good by some farmer cadres, they didn't have a big market after all, and there were no conditions for publication, so most of them had to be put away and destroyed or lost by the war. Sometimes I wrote some popular little stories, clappers, ballads, and small scripts, printed them into mimeographed pamphlets, and used them as propaganda materials, which did play a role; but I didn't pay much attention to them, writing them casually, what did they count as! Others said they weren't bad, but I was still a little embarrassed! This kind of thought and feeling made my work not deep enough and my writing didn't improve.

    After 1942, the environment behind enemy lines became more tense, the work became heavier, and the life became more difficult, all of which seemed easy to deal with; but looking at the rectification documents, thinking about the issue of the mass viewpoint, and considering the actual situation encountered in the work, I suddenly felt that the problem was serious. When there was a drought and no rain, I also rationally paid attention to the crops and the sky, but sometimes I inevitably forgot; once, after a meeting, I was walking back and encountered a heavy rain, and at first I felt good, the crops were saved, but slowly I felt too uncomfortable like a drowned rat, and I thought, can't the rain slow down a little, but the farmer cadres who were traveling with me were studying with great interest how long the rain would last and how many fingers deep it would be, and how many years of harvest could be expected with a few fingers! Once again, one night it hailed, and the farmer who slept with me didn't sleep all night, sighing and groaning, and getting up from time to time to take a look, afraid of damaging the crops; although I was also worried about this, I complained that he was disturbing my sleep, and I thought: you're just making a fuss in vain! Isn't it more practical to have a good night's sleep? But how could I know that he couldn't sleep at all! Once again, I went to a village with a farmers' association comrade to check the rent reduction work. Both of us seemed to have no problems with the policy beforehand, and I seemed to remember some specific provisions more clearly than that comrade; but when we encountered a matter in which both the landlord and the tenant were willing to turn the fixed rent into a flexible rent, I knew that the flexible rent was more disadvantageous to the tenant than the fixed rent, but I was almost deceived by the superficial situation at that time, and almost agreed to them! Afterwards, although the comrade from the farmers' association only jokingly taught me a few words, I felt that I had learned more than reading two books. All of this is a matter of position, a matter of thought and feeling; I began to recognize myself more. During this period, in addition to writing some clappers and ballad propaganda materials, I also wrote four or five novels, most of which were lost, leaving only one, which has finally met with more readers these years, and maybe it still has some meaning.

    I am even more determined to go further into the farmers.

    In the winter of 1943, the enemy's most cruel "mopping-up" operation came, and I went to the guerrilla area of Fanshi, Shanxi. I stood firm at any time, lived and labored with the farmers, and learned to speak the local dialect. In two villages, I worked with the farmers to find ways to reduce rent, increase wages, reform burdens, and fight against the enemy, and lived day and night in complicated problems. I finally did a little bit of work. Later, even if the couples in the village quarreled, they would ask me to mediate. The women in that place who were afraid of seeing people could also chat, and everyone could enter and leave the houses at will. A cadre in one village also said: I have solved all the problems in their village! Therefore, in that area where the masses had not been well mobilized, I encountered enemy encirclements several times. Once I was surrounded and had no choice but to drill into the haystack to prepare for sacrifice, but I was finally able to escape safely with the help of the masses. But soon, because there were many dogs in the villages, and we often entered and left the villages and carried out activities at night, the enemy on the fortress not far away could hear the dogs barking, which was inconvenient for our work, so we decided to launch a dog-killing campaign. The village cadres agreed, and I first asked the youth militia captain to take the lead in killing his dog; he was the most active cadre, with a fiery temper, who loved to fight, and naturally he didn't hesitate to kill the dog. I was also young and energetic, with a lot of energy, and secretly wanted to take this opportunity to get some dog meat to eat, and also wanted to get two dog skins to wear to block the bitter cold of the terrain; therefore, I also went with him to do it. But when he hugged the dog up like he usually played with the dog, and I helped to tie a loop on the rope hanging on the tree to trap the dog's neck, his mother discovered this, but shouted and cried and rushed out of the house to stop it; I was about to persuade his mother, when the militia captain suddenly threw away the rope, and instantly his face was streaming with tears, and he ran to the base of the wall and squatted down and cried! I panicked for a while, and then barely calmed down and explained a few words to the captain's mother. She bought two more sesame cakes for the dog to eat, and the militia captain barely gritted his teeth and strangled the dog. After it was over, my fantasy of eating dog meat and wearing dog skin disappeared without a trace, and I buried the dog with the militia captain, and comforted the captain's mother, and reviewed our mistake of not explaining it clearly to her beforehand; she also shed tears, saying how the dog had looked after sheep and guarded the door in the past, how it was as close as a boy, and criticized us workers for being young and ignorant, and I sincerely accepted them all. After this incident, the relationship between me and the militia captain's family, and other villagers, seemed to be deeper for some reason. I was slowly able to know some of the real family affairs of the farmers and the complex relationships between the farmers, especially between the farmers and the landlords, and was able to hear some "private words" instead of "official words"; a cadre once said that I had solved all the problems in their village, but I found that there were still many problems, but the farmers felt that those problems were not "official matters" and never thought of taking them out to ask the workers to solve them... I realized that our work was not deep enough, and even personally heard that the farmers were not satisfied with the rent reduction policy and demanded a thorough solution to the land problem. All of this made me feel that my transformation was not enough, and it also made me think more about the farmers and the interests of the farmers in my future work.

    At this time, in the guerrilla area in the war environment, I received the mimeographed speech of Chairman Mao's literary and art symposium, and saw that "to change from one class to another class" requires a change in thoughts and feelings, requires determination, and "requires long-term and even painful tempering": this was a great warning to me. In the year or so after that, in the consolidated area, I honestly participated in some mass production work, saw more of the great facts of mass power and the genius of mass literary and art creation, and quietly rectified the unhealthy tendencies, and writing naturally stopped; after the Japanese surrender, I returned to work, and I was indeed more down-to-earth and more humble, but sometimes I was also a little complacent, thinking: I've been transformed almost enough now! In writing, it seemed that I had written one or two pieces that reflected things that were not bad, and unconsciously fueled that complacency. The consequence of this was that when I was working with workers in Zhangjiakou, when I reviewed my work, I found that my position was not clear enough, and my class viewpoint was still relatively vague in the early stage of land reform. It was not until the great tide of land reform and land review movement that I was able to deal with problems more habitually and naturally. In my work in the new district, I grasped the mass line with leadership in everything, and I finally did not make big mistakes or go astray; and my feelings and life, perhaps, can be said to be closer to the farmers, and I have learned a little bit of the ability to truly "go down to the household" in the countryside. This estimate may still be complacent! I should be vigilant at all times.

    As for writing, I haven't produced anything yet. I think: my thoughts and feelings may have been transformed a little bit, and I may be a little bit familiar with the lives of the farmers; but how to refine, organize, and even write works that can better serve the masses is still often troubling, especially since I haven't paid more attention to learning folk literature and art in these years, which cannot but be a major defect. Fortunately, I am still on the road of learning, and I will continue the past in the future, temper myself, and strive for some political and artistic improvement and writing opportunities, and I will contribute all my strength to the people.

　　在学习的路上
    康濯
    在河北山西的农村呆了十年，因为爱好文艺，从中学校一跳出来就跑到延安鲁艺文学系学习，到敌后以后，虽然主要的不是搞创作，而是作群众工作，搞土地问题和生产，搞农村剧团，编通俗报刊，作一般的宣教工作，又忙乱又庞杂；但也没有完全忘记学习写作，并且也曾在战斗紧张和工作繁忙中，硬挤时间，今天写几百字，过十天半月甚至三五个月再写千把字，这样拚拚凑凑，写过一些反映农民的短篇故事和小说。想想十年，自己在创作上并没有成绩，对文艺和工农兵结合的问题，更没有系统地想过；不过，想想这些年来自己思想感情慢慢开始变化和改造的过程，好象也多少学习了一些东西。
    记得一九三八、三九年，开始学写作，就不完全自觉地感到要写农民和士兵，于是便注意他们的生活，记录他们的语言，并特别热心于搜集他们的故事，加以想象、编造，写成小说或素描；但写出来的象不象农民？自己不仅没信心，而且很恐慌，很快地并觉着那些东西没生气、没分量、不满意。怎么办呢？心想大概是自己还不深入！于是在一九三九年底四○年初，就决心“深入”一番，虽在剧团工作，却常常钻到农民里面去聊天，去参加会议，态度不完全是为了搜集材料，有时也给他们的工作出出主意；这样一来，不仅农民的生活和语言把我吸住了，而且农民的力量也使我大吃一惊！这时写的几个故事和剧本，语言、生活、趣味是不同一些了，但那也主要是“猎奇”，而且使我苦恼的是：农民们谈工作、讨论问题、说抗日道理，倒还好懂；但他们为什么会那么热情地抗日？为什么有的又落后？搞不清！特别是农民的家务事，亲戚里道的复杂关系，一个妇女整天不出门可到底鼓捣些什么，不是耳朵眼睛能听见看见的地主与农民的复杂斗争情况等，这些更搞不清。我想，在剧团里要搞清这些怕是很难的，于是便作群众工作去了。
    在群众团体，慢慢学了些政策，听汇报也知道了些全面情况，下乡检查工作，更常常发现一些“奇闻”；虽然主要是搞农民的文化教育工作，自己就已经觉得豁然开朗，对工作兴趣颇大，对搜集材料记录语言却看得平淡甚至不作了。有时也挤时间写点东西，就开始考虑并尝试全部用群众语言，不仅作品中的对话，而且叙述描写也这样；内容并想着尽量深刻地反映农民生活。不过这也只是写些生活细节，又根本没注意向民间文艺学习，特别自己经常只是以小资产阶级知识分子的热情，从农民生活所受到的感动、激动、冲动来写东西，因而作品总要夹杂不健康不朴素的玩意，这又哪里能深刻地写出农民？哪里能全部解决语言问题？虽有两篇有些农民干部说不错，却到底市场不大，又没发表条件，大多只好放起来任战争给毁了丢了算了。有时也写些通俗小故事、快板、歌谣、小剧本，印成油印散篇，当作宣传品，倒起过点作用；但自己又不大重视，信手成篇，算得什么！别人说不坏，自己还不大好意思呢！这种思想感情，使自己工作不深入，写作没进步。
    一九四二年以后，敌后环境更紧张，工作更繁重，生活更艰苦，这一切似乎倒还好对付；但看看整风文件，想想群众观点问题，考虑考虑工作中碰到的实际情况，自己忽然觉得问题严重了。天旱不雨，我也理性地经常注意庄稼和天色，但有时不免又忘了；某次开完一个大会往回走碰见大雨淋头下，开始我倒觉得好，庄稼有救了，但慢慢却感到全身落汤鸡一样太不舒服，心想雨不能稍稍慢一点下么，但同行的农民干部，却津津有味地研究着那雨下多久会有几指深，下几指可望几成年景！又一回，某夜下雹子，同睡的农民一夜没睡着，长嘘短叹，不时起来看看，光怕打坏庄稼；我虽然也为这事发愁，但又嫌人家扰乱了睡觉，心想：你着急还不是白闹！不会好好睡一觉来得实在些么？我可哪里知道他万也睡不着呢！还有一回，和一个农会同志同到一个村去检查减租工作，我两个事先对政策研究得似乎都没问题，有些具体条文，我好象还比那同志记得熟；但碰到一件租佃双方都愿把死租变成活租的事情，我明知活租对佃农比死租吃亏，却差点为当时的表面情况迷惑，几乎同意他们！事后农会那个同志虽只是玩笑地训了我两句，我却觉得比读两本书学习的还多。所有这些，是立场问题，是思想感情问题；我开始更多地认识了自己。这时期除了写点快板歌谣宣传品外，倒也写了四五篇小说，大多丢了，只留下一篇，这些年总算和较多的读者见了面，也许还多少有点意义。
    我决心更大地要进一步到农民里面去。
    四三年冬天，敌人最残酷的大“扫荡”来了，我到了山西繁峙的游击区。我随时警惕地站稳立场，和农民一道起居劳动，说话也学说当地话，在两个村里，和农民一起想办法搞减租、增资、改造负担和对敌斗争，日夜生活在繁杂的问题当中，总算多少作了点事，到后来村里两口子吵架也要找来调解，那地方不敢见人的妇女也能聊聊天，各家各户都能随便进出，有一个村的干部并说：我把他们村的问题都解决完了！因此，在那群众原本没有很好发动的地区，我几次遇到敌人包围，有一次并被围得没办法只好钻了草堆准备牺牲，也终于能安全地在群众帮助下脱险。但不久，因为各村狗多，我们又多是黑夜进出村庄和进行活动，狗一叫唤，不远敌人的堡垒上就听见，对我们工作不方便，于是我们决定来一个打狗运动。村干部同意了，我首先就要青年民兵队长起模范打死他的狗；他是个最积极的干部，性子强得象烈火，专爱打仗，对打狗自然毫不迟疑。我也年轻气盛，有股子干劲，私下里又想趁此闹点狗肉吃，还想闹两张狗皮穿上挡挡那地势的苦寒；因此我也和他一道去动手。但当他象平日逗狗玩一样把狗抱起来，我帮着把搭在树上的绳索挽了个套套住狗的脖子时，他妈发现了这事，却大呼喊叫地啼哭着从屋里冲出来阻挡；我正说要劝劝他妈，民兵队长突然把绳子一丢，刹时间满脸淌着眼泪、跑到墙根圪＠着啼哭去了！我慌了一阵，才硬冷静地给队长他妈解释了几句，她又买了两个烧饼给狗吃了，民兵队长这才勉强咬着牙勒死了狗。完了以后，我吃狗肉穿狗皮的幻想，跑得没了踪影，并和民兵队长一道把狗埋了，又安慰队长他妈，检讨我们事先没跟她妈说清楚的错误；她也就流着眼泪，说那狗过去怎么怎么给看羊、看门，怎么跟一个小子一样亲，又指摘我们这些办工作的怎么年轻不懂事，我都诚恳的一一接受。而经过了这场事，我和民兵队长一家子，和其它别的乡亲，不知怎么关系好象更深一些了，我慢慢能够知道一些农民的真正家务事和农民之间、特别是农民与地主之间的复杂关系，能够听到一些“私话”而不是“官话”；曾有干部说过我把他们问题都解决完了的那个村，我又发现原来问题还很多，只是农民们觉得那些问题都不是“官事”，从没想到要拿出来请办工作的解决……我认识了我们工作的不深入，甚至也亲自听到了农民对减租政策也并不满足，而要求彻底解决土地问题。所有这些，使我感觉到自己改造的不够，也使我在以后工作当中，更多地想到农民、想到农民的利益。
    就在这时，在战争环境的游击区，我接到了油印的毛主席文艺座谈会讲话，看到了“由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”，需要思想感情起变化，需要下决心，“经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练”：这对我是个太大的警惕。此后一年多，我在巩固地区自以为老实地参加了一些群众生产的工作，见了更多群众力量伟大的事实，和群众文艺创造的天才，又安安静静地整了整歪风，写作自然停顿；到日本投降以后再走上工作岗位，自己倒的确踏实些了，也虚心些了，但有时却又多少有点自满，心想：这下子改造得差不多了吧！而在写作上，又似乎写了一两篇反映也还不坏的东西，无意识地又助长了那点自满。这后果，是在张家口作工人工作时，检讨起来立场还不够明确，土地改革初期自己阶级观点仍较模糊。直到土地改革和土地复查运动的大浪潮中，自己才能够比较习惯比较自然地处理问题，在新区工作当中，一切把握着有领导的群众路线，总算没犯大错误，没出偏向；而自己的感情和生活，也许可说是进一步地靠近了农民，学了一点点能够真正去农村“下户”的本领。这估计，还许又是自满吧！我应该时刻警惕着。
    至于写作，却还没拿出东西。我想：自己的思想感情也许有了点改造，对农民生活也许熟悉了一点点；但怎么提炼、组织以至写成比较能为群众服务的作品，却还常常苦恼，特别是自己这些年没有更多地注意学习民间文艺，这不能不是个大缺陷。好在自己还是在学习的路上走着，今后将继续以往，磨炼下去，并争取一些政治上文艺上的提高和写作的机会，有多大力量，一定全部贡献给人民。
