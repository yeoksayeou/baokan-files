　　People's Bank of Jidong Branch
    Loans 360 Million to Support Public and Private Industry and Commerce
    [Tangshan Telegram] The Jidong Branch of the People's Bank of China is actively developing lending business. In June, it issued various loans totaling 360,398,000 to assist 260 public and private industrial and commercial enterprises in restoring and developing production. Of this loan, 14.8 percent was lent to public industries, 18.4 percent was lent to 139 private industries (including ironworks, ceramics, cotton gins, etc.), investment in trade branch companies and municipal supply and marketing cooperatives accounted for 11.3 percent, loans to trade companies and cooperative enterprises accounted for 51.5 percent, and private commercial and mortgage loans accounted for 4 percent. Loans to public and private industries are mainly used to solve difficulties such as some raw materials and wages. For example, the ceramics and iron industries are currently in a slump with poor sales. Obtaining loans can prevent them from stopping work. The state-owned Tangshan Iron Factory produced more than 100 waterwheels after receiving a loan of more than 10 million. Fourteen private ceramic enterprises, such as Dongxi Gang Kiln and Xinming Porcelain Factory, purchased 800 tons of coal after receiving loans, solving the fuel problem for two months. The investment and loan amount of trade companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, etc. is the largest, increasing the leadership of the state-owned economy. These funds are mainly used for planned procurement of agricultural products, adjusting urban and rural materials, and stabilizing the market, such as purchasing employee coal tickets and gradually increasing coal prices. The price of coal tickets for the three eastern mines (Linxi, Zhao Gezhuang, Tangjiazhuang) increased from 2,800 yuan per ton to 4,200 yuan in June. This reduced the intermediate exploitation by merchants, ensured the development of cooperative undertakings, and assisted employee cooperatives. Loans to private commercial enterprises played a role in adjusting materials in friendly areas. For example, Yisheng Yong (oil industry) purchased 60,000 kilograms of bean cake from Harbin with a loan of 600,000 yuan, along with its own capital. Although the above-mentioned loans have played a certain role, due to the bank's insufficient and untimely inspection of loans, some merchants believe that there is an opportunity to take advantage of, using loans for speculation, which affects the bank's plan to continuously support production, and it is urgent to find ways to prevent this.

　　人民银行冀东分行
    贷款三亿六千万扶植公私工商业
    【唐山电】中国人民银行冀东分行积极开展放款业务，六月份共发放各种贷款三亿六千三百九十八万，扶助二百六十户公私营工商企业恢复发展生产。此项贷款百分之十四点八贷与公营工业，百分之十八点四贷给一百三十九户私营工业（包括铁工、陶瓷、轧花等行业），向贸易分公司及市供销合作总社投资占百分之十一点三，向贸易公司及合作事业放款占百分之五十一点五，私营商业及抵押放款占百分之四。公私营工业贷款主要使用于解决部分原料工资等困难，如陶瓷、铁工等业，目前正值困月，销路不畅，获得贷款后，可使其不致停工。公营唐山铁工厂获得代款一千余万元后，赶制水车一百余台。东西缸窑新明磁厂等十四户私营陶瓷业，经贷款后，买煤八百吨，解决了两个月的燃料。贸易公司、供销合作总社等的投资和放款额最大，增加了国营经济的领导力量。这些资金主要是用于有计划的收购农产品，调剂城乡物资，稳定市场，如收购职工煤票，逐步提高煤价，东三矿（林西、赵各庄、唐家庄）煤票价在六月份内由每吨二千八百元提高到四千二百元。减少了商人的中间剥削，保障了合作事业的发展，并协助了职工合作社。私营商业放款起了调剂友区物资的作用，如义升永（油业）贷款六十万元后，连同自己的资本，从哈尔滨购来豆饼六万斤。以上贷款虽起了一定的作用，但由于银行对贷款的检查不够普遍，不及时，有些商人认为有机可乘，利用贷款投机，影响了银行连续扶助生产的计划，急须设法防止。
