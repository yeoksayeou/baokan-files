Communist Party, leading the way,
Workers and peasants hold the power,
Escaping the sea of suffering,
Each step sweeter than the last.

To be sweet, step by step,
Organize for mass production,
Industry is like a locomotive,
Industry must develop first!

To commemorate the Party, truly commemorate,
Workers' commemoration is not empty talk,
A grand mobilization at the commemoration meeting,
Be a model in the locomotive!

All great rivers and seas have sources,
Every anniversary reminds us of the past,
Let us sing a bit of the past,
Sing about the past, then get to work!

In the past, you were poor, and I was poor,
We all worked together,
Young people feared unemployment,
Old age feared immobility.

You were busy, and I was busy,
Busy like a machine,
When the machine breaks, it's repaired,
When a worker gets sick, they cry!

Working hard for whom?
Foreigners, compradores, and corrupt officials.
What did we get from being beaten and bullied?
Sold our strength, then died!

How many years of toil for foreign bosses,
Toiling for wages,
Struggling again and again,
Each struggle drawing blood!

Later, you thought, and I thought,
Wishing for a Communist Party like the Soviet Union.
Suddenly, lightning flashed,
And the Chinese Communist Party emerged!

In the heavens, there is the Double Seventh Festival,
On Earth, there is the July First,
On the Double Seventh, the Cowherd meets the Weaver Girl,
On July First, the Chinese Communist Party's birthday.

China faces strong enemies inside and out,
Internally opposing feudalism and bureaucracy, externally opposing imperialism,
The Party began fighting from birth,
Fighting bravely without rest!

Brave, brave, truly brave,
Back then, we had no guns,
Shouting slogans meant being buried alive,
Writing slogans meant going to jail!

Strikes and demonstrations could scare the enemy,
But ultimately, they couldn't defeat guns!
Not fighting also meant unemployment,
Each struggle drawing blood!

Slogans must be shouted with guns,
Go to the countryside to seize guns;
More guns, more people,
First, help the peasants to divide the land!

Chairman Mao called out to us,
Calling high, calling far,
Comrades followed Chairman Mao,
The Red Army went to Jinggang Mountain!

The Red Army went to Jinggang Mountain,
The revolution had a foothold.
Land is the root, guns are courage,
With land as a foothold, courage knows no bounds!

Ten thousand-year snow mountains are hard for birds to fly over,
A thousand miles of grasslands are devoid of human habitation,
To resist Japan, we had to go north,
The 25,000-li Long March to Yan'an!

Chairman Mao, holding the red flag,
The red flag beckoned, beckoning heroes from all directions,
The red flag unfurled, unfurling a victorious situation,
The red flag planted all over China's mountains!

Settled in northern Shaanxi for twelve and a half years,
The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao then came down from the mountains,
The Japanese bandits were destroyed, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was finished,
The most glorious period of history was in Yan'an!

Old and young are happy,
Long-separated flesh and blood reunite!
We parted with no guns in our hands,
Returned with millions of troops!

We parted for twenty-two years,
Cities and villages were hard to connect,
When we parted, our Party was still young,
Now, one hand can lift up the country!

To seize guns in the countryside,
We traversed thousands of rivers and mountains,
To create an industrial nation,
Even if the industrial Long March has just begun!

Even if the industrial Long March has just begun,
Dare to guarantee! Dare to ensure!
Chinese workers have never feared difficulties,
Let us roll up our sleeves and compete!

Before, we labored for compradores,
And for that group of dirty dogs, the officials,
Now, we labor for ourselves,
Socialism is just one mountain away!

Before, we did perfunctory work for foreigners,
Working only a few hours a day,
Now, labor is very different,
Every worker strives to be a hero!

Thinking of the past, thinking of the future,
Thinking and thinking, we commemorate,
Today we commemorate the Party's birthday,
The working class is happiest!

Happy that Chairman Mao is safe,
Happy that Commander-in-Chief Zhu is healthy,
We shout:
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!
We shout:
Creating an industrial nation, we workers dare to ensure!
Creating an industrial nation, we workers dare to ensure!
1949.7.1, Beiping
(Written in Beiping on "July First." On July 3rd, representatives from the Beiping workers, a female worker and a male worker, came to congratulate the Cultural Congress. After the two worker representatives spoke to the literary and art representatives to congratulate them and put forward sincere and enthusiastic worker demands, I, following the instructions of the Presidium, recited this poem. This poem can be recited in a very free, fast tempo, or it can be sung in the style of storytelling with drum and clapper or Henan Zhui Opera. It might be more appropriate to sing it in some worker-popular tunes. Inappropriate parts can be changed. May the worker comrades accept this poem as a small gift. Zhongping's postscript.)

　　创造工业国，工人敢保险
    （为中国工人庆祝中国共产党廿八周岁作）
    柯仲平
    共产党，领头干，
    工农人民掌了权，
    从此脱离那苦海，
    一步更比一步甜。
　
    要想甜，步步甜，
    组织起来大生产，
    工业好比火车头，
    工业首先要发展！
　
    纪念党，好纪念，
    工人纪念不空谈，
    纪念会上大动员，
    火车头里做模范！
　
    大江大海都有源，
    每逢纪念想当年，
    我们来把当年唱一段，
    唱罢当年干起来！
　
    当年你穷我也穷，
    你我大家来做工，
    年轻时候怕失业，
    年老又怕不能动。
　
    你也忙，我也忙，
    忙的就同机器一个样，
    机器坏了人修理，
    工人病了哭一场！
　
    忙来忙去为了谁？
    洋人买办同赃官。
    挨打受气得了啥？
    卖尽力气死了完！
　
    洋工磨了多少年，
    磨来磨去为工钱，
    斗争一回又一回，
    一回斗争流回血！
　
    到后来你想我也想，
    想有苏联样的共产党。
    忽然电闪霹雷响，
    中国出了共产党！
　
    天上有个七月七
    人间有个七月一
    七月七，牛郎会织女，
    七月一，中国共产党生日。
　
    中国内外有强敌，
    内反封建官僚外反帝，
    党出娘胎便战斗，
    勇敢战斗从不息！
　
    勇敢勇敢真勇敢，
    当年手里无枪杆，
    喊喊口号得活埋，
    写写标语坐了监！
　
    罢工示威能把敌人吓破胆，
    到底还是斗不过枪杆！
    不斗也会失了业，
    一回斗争流回血！
　
    口号要凭枪来喊，
    农村里去夺枪杆；
    枪要多来人要广，
    先帮农民去分田！
　
    毛主席向我们呼喊，
    呼的高，喊的远，
    同志跟随毛主席，
    红军上了井岗山！
　
    红军上了井岗山，
    革命有了立脚点。
    地是根，枪是胆，
    有地立脚胆包天！
　
    万年雪山难飞鸟，
    千里草地绝人烟，
    为了抗日要北上，
    二万五千里长征到延安！
　
    毛主席，拿红旗，
    红旗招，招来了四方好汉，
    红旗展，展开了胜利局面，
    红旗插遍全中国的山！
　
    陕北扎了一十二年半，
    党中央毛主席才下了山，
    日寇灭，蒋匪帮完蛋，
    最光荣的一段历史在延安！
　
    老也欢，少也欢，
    久别了的骨肉大团圆！
    离别手里无枪杆，
    归来雄兵几百万！
　
    一别别了二十二个年，
    城市乡村难相联，
    别时我党还年幼，
    如今一手能把江山提起来！
　
    为到农村夺枪杆，
    踏遍了万水千山，
    为要创造工业国，
    哪怕工业长征才开端！
　
    哪怕工业长征才开端，
    敢保证！敢保险！
    中国工人从来不怕难，
    看我们挽起袖子来竞赛！
　
    从前劳动为买办，
    还为那群狗脏官，
    如今劳动为自己，
    社会主义只隔一重山！
　
    从前劳动磨洋工，
    一天磨上几点钟，
    如今劳动大不同，
    工人个个争英雄！
　
    想了从前想将来，
    想着想着来纪念，
    今天纪念党生日，
    工人阶级最喜欢！
　
    喜的毛主席平安，
    欢的总司令康健，
    我们喊：
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    我们喊：
    创造工业国，我们工人敢保险！
    创造工业国，我们工人敢保险！
    一九四九、七、一、北平
    （“七一”在北平写成。七月三日，北平工人派来代表，一位女工，一位男工，庆贺文代大会。在两位工人代表向文艺代表们讲话庆贺并提出诚恳热烈的工人要求后，得主席团指示，我接着朗诵了这一首诗。这诗，可以用很自由的快板调子来朗诵，还可以用大鼓、坠子这类调子唱。用工人中流行的某些调子来唱，可能更合适。不合适的地方可以改。这首诗，愿工人同志们当做一份小小的礼物收下。　仲平附记）
