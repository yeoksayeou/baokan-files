From 1926 to 1935, in just ten short years, China experienced two "silver disasters" in quick succession.

The first was from 1926 to 1932. At that time, world silver prices plummeted. The New York silver price fell from an average of 69 cents per ounce in 1925 to an average of 28 cents per ounce in 1932. A large influx of silver into China led to inflation, soaring prices, active speculation, economic and social chaos, and a deterioration in the people's lives. This silver disaster was orchestrated by British imperialism, which oversaw India's currency reform, changing from the silver standard to a managed gold standard linked to the pound sterling, and sought to sell 220 million ounces of silver held by the Indian government to exchange for gold or gold coins to increase the gold reserves of the British Empire. China became the dumping ground for silver, and disaster struck!

The second was from 1933 to 1935. At that time, world silver prices soared. The New York silver price rose from an average of 28 cents per ounce in 1932 (the lowest price was 24 cents) to 81 cents in April 1935. It increased more than threefold in three years. A large outflow of silver from China led to deflation, plummeting prices, industrial and commercial bankruptcies, and serious unemployment. This silver disaster was orchestrated by American imperialism, which initiated the International Silver Conference, established the International Silver Agreement, and promulgated the Silver Purchase Act. In 1934, it further declared silver to be nationalized. This action by American imperialism restored silver, which had previously been excluded from coinage, to partial use in coinage and as a monetary reserve in the United States. The national treasury could purchase domestic and foreign silver at a fixed price. The rise and fall of silver prices were entirely manipulated by the U.S. government.

In these two "silver disasters," the beneficiaries were the financial giants of Britain and the United States, and the main victims were the people of China and India. Chinese bureaucratic capitalists, due to their collusion with British and American imperialism, shared in many of the benefits and laid their foundation amidst the suffering of the people. Later, through the implementation of the legal tender policy, economic controls during the War of Resistance, and the embezzlement of U.S. aid, they grew into an unprecedented monopoly capital in Chinese history.

Clearly, the massive concentration of gold and silver is the two major weapons of U.S. imperialism for controlling international finance. The U.S. Treasury has concentrated gold worth more than US$24.46 billion, equal to three-fifths of the world's reserves (see Reuters dispatch of July 6), which is a weapon to control Western Europe and other vassal states. It has also concentrated more than 2.78 billion ounces of silver (this is the figure at the end of 1948, see the Indian Reserve Bank Monthly Report), which is a weapon to control the silver-producing countries of the world, especially many backward countries in the Far East and Near East that like to hoard silver. On the one hand, the U.S. boasts the world's largest productivity, boasting that whatever you need, I will sell it to you. On the other hand, it boasts that it has the most gold and silver in the world, boasting that if you don't have money to buy my goods, I can lend it to you. The condition for selling is to exploit the sweat and blood of the people of various countries, and the condition for lending is to further control the sovereignty of various countries and interfere in their internal affairs.

Especially in the case of silver, the U.S. Treasury, of course, concentrates the most silver in the world (this refers only to the silver held by the governments of various countries; the amount held by the private sector is not so large), and U.S. capital also controls 66% of the world's silver production. Mexico, the world's largest silver-producing country, has 75% of its production under the control of U.S. capital. Therefore, negatively, in order to maintain its economic interests, U.S. imperialism must control the world's silver market; positively, it also can utilize silver policy as a financial weapon in order to control the politics of North and South America and the Near East and Far East. The United States, before and after the War of Resistance, used the promise to purchase China's silver as a means of flattery, and Kuomintang bureaucrats also boasted of their ability to sell silver to the United States, which is a good example.

Due to the loss of its important position in coinage (this position is gone forever), despite the U.S.'s best efforts to raise silver prices, the decline in silver prices can be said to be essentially determined. In addition to the factor of constant oversupply in terms of quantity, the fact that silver production as a copper mine by-product does not require too much cost calculation is also a factor. In the past 30 years, the London silver price has fallen from 89.5 pence per ounce in 1920 to the lowest price of 12 pence in 1931. Statistics show that among all commodities, silver has one of the largest price fluctuations. So, fundamentally, silver has historically lost its basic condition as a currency material—stable value. Although since 1934, due to U.S. political action, silver prices have maintained relative stability for more than ten years, its foundation is still very weak. In 1946, the highest and lowest price difference of silver in the New York market was as high as 19 cents per ounce, and in 1947, the price difference was even larger to 26.5 cents. The reasons why the price fluctuations are so great are shocking! The main reason is that, fundamentally, political means cannot dictate economic laws. Secondly, the United States itself has already abandoned the gold standard, and even gold reserves have lost their main economic function, and silver reserves have become even more insignificant. The main function of gold and silver reserves today is only to serve as weapons of aggression in politics. Thirdly, the U.S. government can also intentionally manipulate the situation, making some silver-selling countries suffer and some benefit, in order to show off its aggressive diplomatic methods. Doesn't the capitalist "free market" being subject to political control amount to negating itself?

Based on the above facts, we can see very clearly that the Chiang Kai-shek gang's current change to the so-called "silver standard," in addition to what the Xinhua News Agency's commentary on July 14 pointed out, is "on the verge of collapse... engaging in large-scale speculative sabotage, plundering the people, and corrupting the national economy," it is even more blatantly moving towards the road of a true "semi-colony"—to use Sun Yat-sen's terminology. The so-called "silver standard" it has adopted is a more backward and despicable monetary system than that adopted by colonial countries like India and the Philippines. No wonder even the pseudo-Finance Minister Xu Kan admitted that it was a regression. This and the fact that gang leader Chiang Kai-shek personally kowtowed and bowed to the reactionary regime in the Philippine colony, willingly acting as a slave of a slave, performing an unprecedentedly ugly performance, can be said to be "reaching the same goal by different routes."

In addition to advising our compatriots in the unliberated areas to resolutely refuse to accept the pseudo-silver dollar notes for their own benefit, we also hope that compatriots in the liberated areas will recognize the nature of gold and silver and no longer be superstitious about gold and silver, treating them as a means of savings. Gold and silver have completely become playthings in the hands of imperialism, commodities that are "valued by Zhao Meng, but can be made cheap by Zhao Meng." Turning one's property into gold and silver is equivalent to entrusting one's destiny to U.S. imperialism. As mentioned above, history has proven that silver is one of the most unstable commodities in value. Because countries around the world have abandoned the gold standard for more than a decade, the future of gold is likely to be the same as silver. Taking the most unstable thing as a means of savings, even Mr. "Common Sense" would laugh at him for being stupid.

It is conceivable that the People's Government will never adopt the gold and silver standard in the future. Soon the whole country will be liberated, and in the process of completely removing silver from circulation, the price of silver will fall across the board compared to other prices. We must estimate that U.S. imperialism will not allow the new China to sell silver in New York, and India, the world's largest silver-loving country, has long banned silver imports. Therefore, using silver as a means of international payment is not very likely.

The monopoly of the few over the many is inherently a very dangerous thing. The reason why capitalism is bound to perish is because it creates a situation of oligopolistic monopoly. U.S. imperialism monopolizes gold and silver, which "cannot be eaten when hungry or worn when cold," and will be the first to be overthrown—ahead of its huge productive forces. "You monopolize, I don't want it" is an extremely simple way to overthrow the gold and silver monopoly. Now, the international peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union is doing this, and doing it very effectively. The internal contradictions of imperialism are also becoming increasingly acute. The Sterling Bloc led by British imperialism has the task of resisting the U.S. monopoly on gold. The U.S.'s idea of ​​using gold to control Western Europe has largely failed; its current control over Western Europe mainly relies on its strong productivity. However, strong productivity has also brought the threat of economic panic to the U.S. "Don't want your goods, let alone your money" is the slogan that Western European countries will soon put forward to the U.S. At that time, this weapon of gold will completely lose its function.

The revolutionary torrent and ideological progress of colonial peoples will more quickly make the silver weapon in the hands of U.S. imperialism lose its function. China, with a population of 470 million, has largely broken free from the silver trap. Vietnam, Burma, and even other Southeast Asian peoples will soon do the same. Last year, the amount of silver absorbed by the private sector in India was initially estimated at 25 million ounces, but only 16 million ounces were absorbed. The weapon of silver is clearly as backward as spears and broadswords and cannot exert much power.

Imperialism, from a broad perspective, is stupid, but from a small perspective, it still has its shrewdness. When Chiang Kai-shek could still be used as a tool, the U.S. supported him in such a way that it ended up spending more than 5 billion U.S. dollars and bought the resentment of all the Chinese people, which was stupid. Now that Chiang Kai-shek is not qualified to be a tool, he is immediately discarded, and only instructs his colonial Philippine reactionary authorities to summon him for talks, which is shrewd. This is where capitalism differs from feudalism, and it is also where U.S. imperialism is more clever than Chiang Kai-shek. When the two major weapons of gold and silver lose their international role, their fate will be the same as that of Chiang Kai-shek. Although the U.S. will continue to stabilize domestic silver prices in order to protect the interests of domestic silver mining capitalists, the attempt to stabilize international silver prices with wasted money will be gradually abandoned, starting with abandoning markets outside the Americas. At that time, those who are superstitious about silver will inevitably suffer another "silver disaster"! What about the fate of gold? It's only "slightly better" than silver.

The People's Government has adopted the correct position of not adopting the gold and silver standard, but adopting a managed currency based on productivity that meets the needs of the material production and commodity circulation process. On the one hand, it guarantees that the national economy will not be controlled by imperialism at all, and strives for economic independence in the monetary field first. On the other hand, it guarantees that the people's wealth will not fall into the hands of gold and silver, which "cannot be eaten when hungry or worn when cold" and whose prices are completely determined by imperialism and whose value is even extremely unstable. We do not need to hide the fact that, at present, the support of revolutionary military affairs is huge, and production in the newly liberated areas has not yet recovered, and taxation has not yet been rectified. In addition, grain is in a period of scarcity. A certain degree of inflation is inevitable, and therefore, a temporary rise in prices is also inevitable. However, the comparison of prices in the liberated areas and the unliberated areas over the past ten years is sufficient to prove that our inflation is completely different from the malicious inflation of the Chiang Kai-shek gang. The experience of price stability in the Northeast over the past year, as well as the fact that prices in the old liberated areas of North China, Northwest China, Central China, and East China are more stable than those in the newly liberated areas of Jiangnan, are sufficient to prove that once the military situation ends, we have the power to stabilize the currency value. I estimate that after this year's autumn harvest, a large amount of agricultural products, which account for 90% of the national economy, will be put on the market, coupled with the military's basic elimination of the remaining bandit forces in South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China, and the basic completion of the task of rectifying taxation in the newly liberated cities, the monetary situation will inevitably be greatly improved. It is of great benefit to both the new country and ourselves for compatriots across the country to see this clearly.

The People's Government dares to face reality. Based on the above confidence, and at the same time taking into account the fact that prices are not yet stable and people's savings must be encouraged, the People's Bank of China has promoted real-value savings in various liberated areas. This kind of savings uses daily necessities such as grain and cloth as the calculation standard, and completely determines the index based on the rise and fall of market prices, as the standard for savings receipt and payment. This kind of savings that can guarantee the people's food, clothing, and daily necessities is the most practical and ideal savings. "Facts speak louder than words." People who have benefited from real-value savings in the past will prove its benefits. This grand and glorious savings is the means of savings that the people of the new China should adopt. Naturally, if everyone can further concentrate savings and engage in production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, that would be even better.

The masses of the new Chinese people must have the same high degree of vigilance in the economic field as in the political field. In the economic field, we must fully recognize all the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang, which represents the remaining forces of the comprador class, the landlord class, and the bureaucratic capitalist class. First of all, in terms of currency, every person in the new China should quickly get rid of the traditional ideas of relying on imperialism and being superstitious about gold and silver. Especially at present, this kind of thinking has become the theoretical guidance for the Chiang Kai-shek gang's conspiracy to plunder the people and undermine the economy of the new country. We should use our high degree of wisdom and vigilance, and work together to smash the enemy's conspiracy for the sake of the country and our own interests.

　　由过去的“银灾”说到蒋匪帮的“恢复银本位制”
    从一九二六到一九三五年，短短的十年当中，中国就接连的经历了两次的“银灾”。
    第一次是从一九二六到一九三二年。那时世界银价惨跌，纽约银价从一九二五年的平均价每盎司美元六角九分，跌到一九三二年的平均价每盎司美金二角八分。中国白银大量入超，形成通货膨胀，物价高腾，投机活跃，经济社会混乱，人民生活恶化的惨祸。这一次的银灾是由英帝国主义导演的。它主持印度的货币改革，由银本位改为联系到英镑的虚金本位，要出卖印度政府所存的白银二亿二千万盎司，换成黄金或金币，以增加大英帝国的黄金存量。中国便变成了白银倾销的尾闾，遭遇到灾殃！
    第二次是从一九三三至一九三五年。那时世界银价暴涨，纽约银价从一九三二年的平均价每盎司美金二角八分（最低价为二角四分）涨到一九三五年四月的八角一分。三年间上涨了三倍强。中国白银翻过来大量出超，形成通货紧缩，物价惨跌，工商业破产，职工失业的严重局势。这一次的银灾是由美帝国主义主演的。它发起了国际白银会议，成立了国际白银协定，颁布了购银法案，至一九三四年更进一步宣布白银国有。美帝国主义的这一行动，使得过去已经被排斥到铸币用途之外的白银，首先在美国恢复了铸币和货币准备金的部分用途，国库可以按定价收买国内和国外的白银。银价的上落完全受美国政府的操纵。
    在这两次“银灾”当中，得利的是英美的金融巨头，遭殃的主要的是中国和印度的人民。中国官僚资本由于和英美帝国主义的勾结，分沾了许多的利益，在人民遭殃之中奠定了他们的基础。以后，经过了法币政策的推行和抗战时期的经济统制，以及美援的中饱，长大了成为中国史无先例的垄断资本。
    很显明的，黄金和白银的大量集中，是美帝控制国际金融的两大武器。美国国库集中了价值美金二百四十四亿六千余万元的黄金，等于全世界储量的五分之三（见七月六日路透电），这是一件控制西欧和其他附庸国的金融的武器。它同时集中了二十七亿八千余万盎司的白银（这是一九四八年年底的数字，见印度准备银行月报），这是一件控制世界各产银国，尤其是远东和近东许多欢喜储藏白银的落后国家的武器。美帝一面拥有全世界最大的生产力，夸耀着说，你们需要什么我卖给你们。它另一面拥有全世界最多的金银，夸耀着说，你们没有钱买我的商品我可以借给你们。卖的条件是剥削各国人民的汗血，借的条件进一步还要控制各国的主权，干涉各国的内政。
    特别在白银方面，美国国库固然集中全世界最多的白银（这单指各国政府持有的白银而言，民间持有的数量并不如此），美国资本还控制了全世界白银产量的百分之六十六。世界最大产银国墨西哥，它的生产的百分之七十五，就是在美国资本的支配之下的。因此，消极的，美帝为要维护经济的利益，必须支配世界的白银市场，积极的，它要控制南北美和近东、远东各国的政治，也正可利用白银政策作为金融上的武器。美国在抗战的前后，曾经以答应收买我国白银为市惠的手段，而国民党官僚也曾经以能够出卖白银给美国这一点来夸耀自己的本领，便是一个很好的例子。
    由于白银在铸币用途上失去它的重要地位（这个地位是一去不复回了），尽管美国用尽一切提高银价的努力，银价的低落可说是本质决定的。关于此，除了数量上经常的供过于求的因素以外，作为铜矿副产的银产不必太多的计算成本也是一个因素。三十年来，伦敦银价曾经从一九二○年的每盎司八十九便士五跌到一九三一年的最低价十二便士。统计数字证明，在一切商品当中，白银要算价格变动最大的一种。所以，根本上，白银已经在历史上失去了他作为币材的基本条件—价值稳定。虽然从一九三四年以来，由于美国的政治行动，使得银价保有十多年来比较的稳定，它的基础依然是十分薄弱的。在一九四六年，纽约市场每盎司白银的最高最低差价大到美金一角九分强，一九四七年的差价更大到二角六分半，涨落之大，也足够惊人了！主要的理由，便是在基本上政治手段不能规定经济法则。其次，便是美国本身已经放弃了金本位，连金准备都已经失去了它的经济上的主要作用，银准备更变成无足轻重了。金银准备目下的主要作用，便只是在政治上作为侵略的武器。又其次，便是美国政府还可以有意的上下其手，使得某些售银的国家吃亏，某些受益，以卖弄它的侵略外交的手法。资本主义的“自由市场”要受政治的支配，还不是等于否定了自己？
    基于以上的事实说明，我们可以极其明白的看出来，蒋匪帮这一次改用所谓“银本位”，除了如新华社七月十四日评论之所指出，是“在穷途末路之际，……进行大规模的投机破坏勾当，洗劫人民，糜烂国家经济”之外，它还更明目张胆的，走向了真正的“次殖民地”——用孙中山先生的术语——的道路。它所采用的所谓“银本位制”，是比印度、菲律宾一流的殖民地国家所采用的币制更加落后，更加卑劣的一种币制。无怪乎连伪财长徐堪都自认是倒退的了。这和匪帮头目蒋介石这一次亲自向菲律宾殖民地反动政权叩头作揖，甘心作奴才的奴才，表演出史无先例的丑态，可说是“殊途同归”的了。
    我们除了要劝告未解放区的同胞们为了自己的利益坚决拒绝接受伪银元券以外，还希望解放区的同胞认清金银的本质，不要再迷信金银，把它们作储蓄的手段。金银已经完全变成了帝国主义手中的玩物，是“赵孟所贵，赵孟可贱”的商品。把自己的财产变成金银，就等于把自己的命运交付给美帝国主义。如上所说，历史已经证明，白银是价值最不稳定的一种商品。由于十多年来全世界各国纷纷放弃金本位，黄金的前途，很可能是与白银同其命运的。拿价值最不稳定的东西作为储蓄手段，“常识”先生都会笑他愚蠢。
    这是可以想象得到的，人民政府将来决不会采取金银本位。不久全国解放，白银将被全部逐出流通的过程，银价比照其他的物价，便要全面下跌。我们要估计到美帝国主义是不会允许新中国在纽约出卖白银的，世界上最大的嗜银国印度，又早已禁止白银入口。因此，以白银作为国际支付的手段，是没有多大可能的。
    少数对多数的垄断，本来是一件极其危险的事情。资本主义之所以必然要灭亡，便是因为它自己造成了一个寡头垄断的局面。美帝垄断了“饥不能食，寒不能衣”的金银，尤其会最先被打倒——先于它的庞大的生产力。“你垄断，我不要”，这便是极其简单的打倒金银垄断的办法。现在，以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营，便是这样做，而且做得极其得法。帝国主义内部的矛盾，也日趋尖锐。英帝国主义所领导的英镑集团，就是以反抗美帝垄断黄金为任务之一的。美帝用黄金来控制西欧的想法，大部分已经落了空；它目前对于西欧的控制，主要的还是依靠它的强大的生产力。然而，强大的生产力又已经带给美帝经济恐慌的威胁。“不要你的货，更不要你的钱”，是西欧各国不久便要向美帝提出的口号。到那时，黄金这一武器便会完全失去作用。
    殖民地人民的革命巨流和思想进步，会更迅速的使得美帝手中的白银武器，失去作用。四亿七千万人口的中国，已经大部分摆脱了白银的圈套。越南、缅甸，以至其他东南亚人民，不久也都会同样的做。印度去年民间吸收的白银，起初估计是二千五百万盎司，结果只吸收了一千六百万盎司。白银这一武器，显然是象长矛大刀一样的落后，不能发挥什么威力了。
    帝国主义从大处说，是愚蠢的，从小处说，却还有它的精明。当蒋介石还可以作为一个工具的时候，美帝是那样的扶植他，结果花了美金五十亿以上的代价，买得了全中国人民的忿恨，这是愚蠢的。现在，蒋介石不配作为一个工具了，就马上唾弃他，只指使它的殖民地菲律宾反动当局召集他谈话，这又是精明的。这是资本主义不同于封建主义的所在，也是美帝比蒋介石高明的所在。当着金银两大武器失去了国际作用的时候，它们的命运是会和蒋介石一样的。尽管美帝为着保护国内银矿资本家的利益，会继续稳定国内的银价，然而花冤钱稳定国际银价的企图却会被逐步放弃，首先便是放弃美洲以外的市场。那时候，那些迷信白银的人们，少不了便要再遭受一次的“银灾”！黄金的命运如何？也不过比白银“稍胜一筹”而已。
    人民政府不采取金银本位，而采取了以生产力为基础，适合物资生产和商品流通过程的需要的管理货币，这种立场是十分正确的。它一面保证了国家经济丝毫不受帝国主义的支配，首先在货币一环争取到经济上的独立，另一面保证人民的财富，不会落入“饥不能食，寒不能衣”而价格又完全受帝国主义规定甚至价值也极其不稳的金银。我们不必讳言，目前为着革命军事的支应浩大，而新解放区的生产尚未恢复，税收也尚未整顿就绪，加以粮食又正在青黄不接的阶段，某种程度的通货膨胀是不可免的，因而一时的物价高涨也是不可免的。然而，十多年来解放区和未解放区物价的对比，已经足够证明，我们的通货膨胀和蒋匪帮的通货恶性膨胀是完全不同的。东北一年来物价稳定的经验，以及目前华北、西北、华中、华东各老解放区物价比较江南新解放区物价稳定的事实，更足够证明，一旦军事结束，我们是有力量稳定币值的。我估计，今年秋收以后，占国民经济比重百分之九十的农产物大量上市，配合着军事上在华南、西南、西北，大体上肃清了匪帮残余势力，新解放的都市大体上完成了整顿税收的任务，货币情况必然可以大大的好转。全国同胞看清这一点，是对于新国家和自己都有极大的益处的。
    人民政府是敢于面对现实的。基于上述的信心，同时照顾到目前物价尚未稳定而人民储蓄必须鼓励的事实，中国人民银行已在各解放区推行折实储蓄。这种储蓄以粮布等日用必需品为计算本位，完全依据市价的涨落订出指数，以为储蓄收付的标准。这种能够保障人民衣食日用所需的折实储蓄，才是最切实而最理想的储蓄。“事实胜于雄辩”，过去得到折实储蓄利益的人们，会证明它的好处。这种堂皇而光荣的储蓄，才是新中国人民应该采取的储蓄手段。自然，倘使大家能够进一步集中储蓄，经营有利于国计民生的生产事业，那是再好不过了。
    新中国的人民大众，在经济上必须具备与在政治上同样的高度警觉。我们在经济上，必须充分认识帝国主义和代表着买办阶级、地主阶级以及官僚资本阶级残余势力的蒋匪帮的一切阴谋诡计。首先在货币上，每一个新中国的人民，都应该赶快摆脱那些依靠帝国主义，迷信金银的传统思想。尤其在目前，这种思想已经成为蒋匪帮阴谋洗劫人民，破坏新国家经济的理论指导，我们更应该为着国家和自己的利益，运用高度的智慧和警觉，共同努力，粉碎敌人的阴谋。
    一九四九、七、一五、于北平。
