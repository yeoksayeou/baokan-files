  　Bandit Chieftain Chiang Kai-shek Flies to the Philippines for Activities
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th] Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek, at the “invitation” of the U.S. puppet state Philippines President Quirino, flew from Taipei to Baguio in the Philippines on the morning of the 10th, accompanied by Wang Shih-chieh, Wu Kuo-chen, and others. Foreign news agencies reported that one of the main tasks of bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek's trip was to discuss the issue of organizing the so-called "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance" with Quirino. On July 4th—the so-called third anniversary of Philippine "independence"—Quirino once again suggested the establishment of this long-clamored "alliance." Quirino's suggestion was actively responded to by the U.S. running dog Syngman Rhee and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In addition to Quirino and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, a representative from MacArthur's headquarters was also "on his way to Baguio to attend the meeting," according to a United Press report from Manila on the 9th. Foreign news agencies reported that another main task of bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek's trip was to discuss with Quirino the issue of establishing a "government-in-exile" of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang in the Philippines and to "request Quirino to allow the storage of Kuomintang assets—gold bars and machinery—in the Philippines" (Agence France-Presse). When an Associated Press reporter asked about the possibility of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang establishing a "government-in-exile" in the Philippines on the 10th, Quirino stated that he did not object to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang moving to the Philippines for "refuge." The talks between Chiang Kai-shek and Quirino in Baguio are obviously a new trick by the United States to oppose the people of Asia, especially to continue interfering in China's internal affairs.

　　听从美帝调遣并准备逃窟
  　匪首蒋介石飞菲活动
    【新华社北平十一日电】匪首蒋介石应美国附庸国菲律宾总统季里诺的“邀请”，于十日上午偕王世杰、吴国桢等，自台北乘机飞赴菲律宾的碧瑶。外国通讯社报道，匪首蒋介石此行的主要任务之一，是与季里诺商谈组织所谓“太平洋反共同盟”问题。季里诺在七月四日——所谓菲律宾“独立”三周年纪念日，曾再次建议成立这个喧嚷已久的“同盟”。季里诺的这一建议，得到了美国走狗李承晚与蒋介石匪帮的积极响应。这次碧瑶会议，除季里诺与蒋介石匪帮外，据合众社马尼剌九日电称，麦克阿瑟总部的一位代表，“也在赴碧瑶出席会议途中”。外国通讯社报道：匪首蒋介石此行的另一主要任务，是与季里诺商谈在菲律宾成立国民党残余匪帮的“流亡政府”问题，并“要求季里诺允许把国民党的资产——金条及机器，存放于菲律宾”（法新社）。当美联社记者于十日询问蒋介石匪帮在菲成立“流亡政府”的可能性时，季里诺表示，他并不反对蒋介石匪帮迁至菲律宾“避难”。蒋介石与季里诺在碧瑶的会谈，显然是美国策动的反对亚洲人民，特别是继续干涉中国内政的新花样。
