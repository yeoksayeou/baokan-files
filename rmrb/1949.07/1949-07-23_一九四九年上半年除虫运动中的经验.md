Experiences in the Pest Control Campaign in the First Half of 1949
Agricultural Technology Improvement Department, Ministry of Agriculture

In the first half of 1949, more than 40 kinds of pests occurred, affecting an area of approximately 5.35 million mu, including 220 counties, 2 cities, and 6,660 villages. Red spider mites occurred in 54 counties in the spring on wheat, and locusts were most serious in the summer, occurring in 152 counties. Thanks to the active leadership of Party, government, and civilian cadres at all levels in leading the masses to eliminate pests, the seriously affected areas have been mostly eradicated. In Ningnan, 150,000 jin of locusts were captured in five or six days, and in Shanxian County, one district caught 400,000 mole crickets in ten days. In particular, locusts were eliminated once, then occurred again, and were eliminated after occurring two or three times in a row. In some places, when the insects ate the crops, they replanted, and replanted two or three times in a row. In Anyang, Cixian, and Wu'an, the number of people eliminating locusts reached 200,000 every day. At present, cotton aphids are still very serious, with an incomplete statistic of 49 counties affected. Stick insects are occurring in Shenze, Qingyuan, Wuji, and Shijiazhuang in central Hebei. Autumn locusts may also occur in the future. Here, we briefly summarize the pest control experiences during this period for future reference in continuing to overcome pest damage.

I. In terms of leadership, Henan Province was vigilant. After the pest occurred, the commissioner and county head personally led the effort, established pest control organizations, and promptly led the masses to eliminate the pests, commended models, and exchanged experiences. These all played a considerable role. In organizing the masses, many methods of combining pest control with farming were also created. For example, in Anyang and Linxian, locusts were captured in the morning and evening, and wheat was harvested and threshed from mid-morning to mid-afternoon. In Neiqiu, rape pollen beetles were captured while organizing the masses to water the wheat. Mobilizing semi-laborers in the pest control movement has also been very effective. In some places, when a pest disaster occurred, a large number of cadres were immediately dispatched to take emergency measures to eliminate the pests, achieving good results. However, this approach, not combined with the organizational work of the masses, is prone to wasting manpower and resulting in administrative orders and individualistic styles of work. For example, in the spring, only red spider mites were noticed, neglecting fruit tree pests, which ate and destroyed many fruit trees. In Linxian, in the fight against locusts, grubs ate more than 50,000 mu of farmland.

II. After the occurrence of pests, various places dispatched a large number of technical cadres to the countryside, so that science and technology began to combine with the mass pest control movement. The masses greatly welcomed technology. According to Director Chen of Taihang, when cadres from the Changzhi Farm stood on the street, the masses would surround them, saying that our technical personnel were "land doctors," asking about all kinds of problems. In a village fair, after the technical personnel talked with people, they immediately organized 192 contracted farmers. In the past, technical personnel had no opportunity to use their skills, but now they are convening cadre meetings of hundreds of people to specifically study pest control. Many problems that could not be solved in the past are now solved. Many scientific methods have been introduced to the masses, and many indigenous methods have been scientifically proven and improved, giving us more confidence and assurance that we will not allow several major pests to become disasters next year. We have studied the occurrence of locusts and are preparing to take measures such as digging up eggs, killing insects, and reclaiming wasteland, draining water, and preventing floods to start eliminating locust breeding grounds from next year. In terms of scientific agents, experience has proven that sodium fluorosilicate poison bait is very effective. Use 1 part of the drug, 25 parts of wheat bran, and 25 parts of water. First, grind the sodium fluorosilicate into a fine powder and mix it evenly with the wheat bran, then add water to prepare it. After application, it can cause locusts to die within 24 hours. Application method: The best time to spread is in the early morning, followed by sunset. The efficacy of spreading poison bait is not great in reed and weedy areas, low temperatures, high humidity, or when it rains. Trial use of 1 part of niter brine diluted with 10 parts of water, and 1 part of bittern diluted with 5 parts of water, is also very effective in killing locusts. However, liquid sodium fluorosilicate has proven to be ineffective. Among the methods used by the masses to capture and kill locust nymphs, the best are encirclement using large cloth sheets, digging pits, burning with fire, and the method of enclosing with reed mats. "If cotton grows aphids, there will be a big show in the fall." Initially, the masses' thinking was very paralyzed. Past experience has proven that not treating cotton aphids reduces the average yield of lint cotton by 10 jin, so it is necessary to actively mobilize the masses to control them. For drugs to control cotton aphids, such as tobacco water and cotton oil emulsion, can be obtained locally. As for the method of using rotenone powder, recent test results have proven that products containing 2% rotenone can be diluted with 900 times water, and products containing 4% rotenone can be diluted with 1,500 times water. The aphid-killing efficacy is around 90%, and it is not necessary to add soap. In the past, when using tobacco lime water, some people worried that too much lime would cause drug damage. Now we know that no more than 8 jin of lime per 100 jin of water will not cause harm, so we can use it boldly in the future. Mr. Zhu Hongfu and Mr. Zhang Guangxue discovered that cotton aphids lay their eggs and overwinter in the roots of bitter vegetables, which further clarifies the importance of weeding for killing aphids. Stick insects lay their eggs on the tips of grain leaves. Before heading, mobilize the masses to check the fields every day. If long, striped, yellowish-white egg masses are found on the grain tips, they should be picked and burned, which is one of the good ways to eliminate stick insects. The stick insect pushing cart invented by the masses can push six mu per day. For pear curculio, millet curculio, hairy caterpillars, tent caterpillars, and pear slugs on fruit trees, the method of trapping and beating with sand piles used by the masses in the past was very laborious. Scraping off the old bark can both be used as firewood and prevent insects, and does not hinder the growth of fruit trees. In early spring, spraying with 1:300 wettable DDT or lead arsenate before the overwintering larvae crawl out of the old bark can kill the pests. Tent caterpillars gather in the net at night and can be burned off. Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces are most concerned about hornworms (nettle caterpillars). Spraying with 1:800 pyrethrum emulsion or 5% DDT and 1:200 lead arsenate is effective during the outbreak period.

III. There are many insects that can be treated, but how to promote the methods? Especially using tobacco water to kill cotton aphids! Everyone knows it, but how to do it? The masses don't dare to do it if they haven't seen it. Shijiazhuang City and North China Farm prepared a large amount of tobacco stalks and tobacco dust for the masses, personally demonstrated how to prepare it, and then tried to promote it, which was very effective. At the same time, we must know that effective science and technology are needed to promote it. If a pest occurs and we are not sure about it, we must first learn from the masses and promote the indigenous methods of the masses. The method of promotion should be tested first, and effective examples should be used to mobilize the masses to adopt it. This is the correct scientific attitude. When red spider mites occurred in Jinzhong, technical personnel went down to use calcium arsenate and copper sulfate for control, and greatly promoted the efficacy of the agents. However, red spider mites are sucking mouthpart pests, calcium arsenate is a stomach poison, and copper sulfate is a fungicide. How can they control them? Using calcium arsenate not only cannot kill red spider mites, but will kill the natural enemies of red spider mites, which will help the pest damage. Therefore, the drug was not effective four or five days after spraying. This approach not only did not master science and technology, but also did not study the promotion methods. Although it was reversed later, it had already lost 3,000 dan of wheat. This shows that to carry out promotion and publicity work, it is necessary to truly master the technology.

　　一九四九年上半年除虫运动中的经验
    农业部技术改进处
    一九四九年上半年发生的害虫，有四十多种，被害面积约计五百三十五万亩包括二百二十个县二个市六千六百六十个村。春季小麦发生红蜘蛛者有五十四县，夏季蝗虫最严重，发生地有一百五十二县，由于各级党政民干部积极领导群众剿除，严重地区已大部扑灭，宁南五、六天捕蝗十五万斤，单县一个区十天内捉蝼蛄四十万个，特别是蝗虫消灭一次，又发生一次，一连发生两三次都扑灭了。有些地方虫子吃毁了再种，一连改种两三次。安阳、磁县、武安剿蝗人数每天达二十万人。目前棉蚜还很严重，据不完全统计已达四十九县。冀中深泽、清苑、无极及石庄正发生粘虫，今后秋蝗也可能发生，我们在这里简单的总结一下这期间的灭虫经验，以供今后继续战胜虫害的参考。
    一、领导上豫有警惕，虫害发生后，专员县长亲自领导，建立除虫机构及时领导群众扑灭，表扬模范、交流经验。这些都起了相当作用。在组织群众中还创造了许多除虫与耕种相结合的办法，如安阳、林县早晚捕蝗，从半前晌到半后晌割麦打场；内邱捕油菜金花虫，同时又组织了群众浇麦子。在除虫运动发动半劳力上收效也很大，有些地方当虫灾发生后，立即抽出大批干部，采取突击办法，扑灭了虫害，成绩很好，但这种做法不和群众的组织工作相结合，极易浪费人力，发生行政命令及单打一的作风。譬如春季只注意了红蜘蛛，忽略了果树害虫，吃毁了不少的果树，林县在打蝗中又发生蛴螬吃了五万多亩田禾。
    二、虫害发生后，各地均派出大批技术干部下乡，使科学技术开始和群众的除虫运动结合起来。群众是非常欢迎技术的，据太行陈处长报告，长治农场干部往街上一站，群众就围起来，说我们的技术人员是“地大夫”，什么问题都来问，某村在庙会上，技术人员通过谈话以后，当下组织了特约农家一百九十二个。过去技术人员英雄无用武之地，现在却都召集几百人的干部大会专门研究除虫。过去不能解决的问题，现在有许多是解决了，有许多科学办法介绍到群众中去，也有许多土办法得到了科学证明和提高，使我们保证明年不使几个主要虫害成灾，更有了信心，有了把握。我们已经研究了蝗虫发生的情况，准备采取刨卵、杀虫及垦荒、排水、防洪等办法，从明年起即开始进行消灭蝗虫发源地的工作。在科学药剂上，经验证明了氟矽酸钠毒饵效力很好，以药一份、麦麸二十五份、水二十五份，先将氟矽酸磨成细粉与麦麸混合均匀，然后加水调制，施用后经过二十四小时，便能使蝗虫死亡，施用方法：散布时间以清晨最好，日落次之，芦苇及野草密生地带，温度低，湿度高或下雨时施用毒饵效力不大。试用以硝卤一份对水十份，盐卤一份对水五份，毒杀蝗虫也很有效，液用氟矽酸钠则证明是没有什么效果的。群众捕打蝗蝻的办法，则以用大布单、挖坑、火烧等围剿办法及扎箔合围法最好。“棉花生了腻，秋后唱大戏”，开始群众思想表现很麻痹，历年经验证明，不治棉蚜，平均少产皮棉十斤，所以应积极动员群众除治。除治棉蚜的药剂，如烟草水、棉油乳剂均可就地取材，至于鱼藤粉的使用法，最近试验结果证明含酮百分之二的可以加水九百倍，含酮百分之四的可以加水一千五百倍，杀蚜效力都在百分之九十上下，而且不必加用肥皂。过去使用烟草石灰水，有人耽心怕石灰多了发生药害，现在知道一百斤水不超过八斤石灰不会有害，今后可以大胆的使用。朱弘复、张广学二先生发现棉蚜寄生苦菜根部产卵越冬，更使我们明确了锄草对杀蚜的重要。粘虫，产卵在谷叶的尖端，在吐穗前发动群众每日到地检查，如发现谷尖有长条形黄白色卵块即采下焚毁是除粘虫的好办法之一。群众发明的推粘虫车，每天能推六亩。果树的梨步曲、黍步曲、星毛虫、天幕毛虫、梨狗子，过去群众用堆沙捕打法很费劲，而刮去老皮，既可做柴又可防虫，果树生长上也无妨碍。春初在越冬幼虫未从老皮爬出前，用一比三百的可湿性ＤＤＴ或砒酸铅喷射，可以将害虫杀死。天幕毛虫晚上集中网中，可以用火烧除。冀鲁豫对八角虫（刺蛾）最感辣手，在发生期喷射一比八百倍除虫菊乳剂或百分之五滴滴涕及一比二百倍砒酸铅均有效。
    三、有很多虫子是有办法治的，但是怎样推广呢？特别是用烟草水杀棉蚜！老百姓谁也知道，究竟怎样做呢？群众没看见就不敢去做。石庄市及华北农场为群众准备下大量的烟梗烟末亲自下手先教给群众配制，然后试用推广，收效很大。同时要知道有了有效的科学技术才能推广，如果发生了虫子我们还没有把握就必须首先向群众学习，发扬群众的土办法。推广的方法要先经过试验，用有效实例动员群众采用，这才是正确的科学态度。晋中发生红蜘蛛，技术人员下去用砒酸钙及硫酸铜去防治，并大大宣传药剂的效能，但红蜘蛛是吸收口器害虫，砒酸钙是胃毒剂，硫酸铜是杀菌剂，怎么能防治呢？用砒酸钙不但不能杀死红蜘蛛，反会杀死红蜘蛛的天敌，助长虫害，因此药剂喷射后四五天不见效，这种做法，既没有掌握科学技术又没有研究推广方法，后来虽经扭转过来，但已损失了小麦三千石。这说明了要进行推广宣传工作必须切实掌握技术。
