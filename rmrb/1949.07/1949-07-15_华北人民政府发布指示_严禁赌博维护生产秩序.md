[This newspaper's own dispatch] The North China People's Government issued a directive on the 13th to governments at and above the county level and all units of the government regarding the prohibition of gambling. The full text is as follows:

　　Since last winter and this spring, gambling has become quite prevalent in the liberated areas of North China, affecting production and construction, as well as social order. In Zhao County, the 8th and 9th districts of Hebei-Central, 40 cases of gambling were seized in ten days. In Jin County, the 8th and 10th districts found 55 gambling dens in 39 villages. In Hebei-Chahar province, 31 gambling cases were seized in Huolu County in February. In the Hebei-South region, 127 cases of gambling occurred in Ye County from January to early April. In a village in Qiu County, some people even wagered their oxen. In Linqing City, a family sold their livestock and carts due to gambling debts. In Liuying Village in Yongnian, gambling losses and winnings amounted to over one million yuan (Hebei currency). In the Taiyue region, a survey of ten villages in Qin County found gambling in eight of them, with single gambling sessions in Qin County and Tunliu and other places involving winnings and losses of around a million (Hebei currency), with oxen also being wagered and pledged.

　　Analyzing the composition of the gamblers apprehended, most of them are professional gamblers and vagrants. Ordinary people also participate, and many village cadres and militiamen take the lead in gambling, which has a significant impact on the growth of gambling in rural areas. The masses say, "If they (referring to the village cadres) don't gamble, who would dare to?" Village cadres and militiamen participating in gambling account for two-thirds of the gambling villages in Zhao County, Hebei-South, and one-quarter in Jin County. In Nanwangmai, Anguo, village cadres led the gambling and even had militiamen stand guard as sentries. In Qin County, village cadres participated in six of the eight gambling villages. In Lingshi, militiamen guarded with guns during gambling sessions in seven villages.

　　Gambling losses and winnings lead to various problems. Winners inevitably engage in excessive eating, drinking, wasteful consumption, and enjoyment. Losers, incited and colluding with bad elements, engage in robbery, theft, and even murder for money, affecting social order. In some areas where gambling is rampant, serious phenomena endangering social order and production have occurred, and corrupt and degenerate habits are growing among some backward masses.

　　In order to practice thrift, develop production, and eliminate loopholes for sabotage by bad elements, it is necessary to strictly prohibit gambling. The measures are: 1. Immediately issue an order strictly prohibiting gambling and, in cooperation with various people's organizations, mobilize and educate the masses to agree on conventions to supervise and prohibit all gambling or disguised gambling behavior. Explicitly stipulate regulations for punishment of those who still do not change after education and persuasion, and deal with violators according to the regulations. 2. Leadership organs at all levels must conduct practical education for village cadres and militiamen who "take the lead" in gambling, ordering them to correct themselves immediately. Those who repeatedly fail to correct their mistakes and whose errors are serious should be severely punished. 3. Strictly control professional gamblers and vagrants, force them to engage in labor and production, and prohibit the sale of land and property obtained in the land reform due to gambling. 4. The fundamental key lies in mobilizing and educating the masses and establishing mass conventions to eliminate gambling with the power of the masses. Adopt various methods such as newspapers, mass meetings, blackboards, rooftop broadcasts, and extensive and in-depth publicity and education through mass organizations, explaining the harm of gambling: "Gambling is a reflection of the decadent and corrupt thoughts and actions of the landlord bourgeoisie. Gambling, wandering, and not engaging in labor and production are shameful. In the old society, gambling led to families being ruined and wives and children being sold. Now, it not only leads to poverty and family discord, but also encounters opposition from the masses and contempt from relatives and friends. If robbery and theft occur due to gambling, they will be punished by law." Furthermore, actively promote thrift, savings, and production for prosperity. After publicity and education, raise the awareness of the masses, inspire the masses to formulate conventions themselves, abide by them, and supervise each other. It is hoped that all localities will quickly study and implement the above points and report the implementation status in a timely manner.

　　华北人民政府发布指示
  　严禁赌博维护生产秩序
    【本报讯】华北人民政府十三日向县以上各级政府及本府各单位发出关于禁止赌博的指示，全文如下：
    去冬今春以来，我华北解放区内地赌博行为相当普遍，影响了生产建设与社会治安。冀中之赵县八、九两区，在十天内抓赌四十起；晋县八、十两区的三十九个村，聚赌者五十五处。察省获鹿县二月份抓赌三十一起。冀南区之邺县一月至四月上旬发生赌博一百二十七起；邱县某庄有的牵上牛去赌博；临清市某户因赌博卖掉牲口大车；永年刘营村赌博输赢达百余万元（冀钞）之巨。太岳区沁县调查十一个村有八个村有赌博情形，并且沁县与屯留等地赌一场即有百万（冀钞）上下的输赢，还有牵牛，押牛的。
    从抓获的赌犯成份上来分析，从事赌博的分子，以赌棍、游民为多，一般群众亦有参加的，并有不少是村干部民兵带头赌博者，对农村赌风的滋长影响很大，群众说“他们（指村干部）不赌谁敢呢”。村干部民兵参加赌博者，在冀南赵县赌博村中占三分之二，晋县占四分之一；安国南王买有村干部带头赌博，并叫民兵站岗警戒；沁县之八个赌博的村子中有六个村有村干部参加。灵石有七个村在聚赌时有民兵持枪警戒。
    由于赌博输赢引起种种问题，如赢者就不免大吃大喝，浪费享受；输者有的就在坏分子挑动勾结下，进行抢劫，偷盗，甚至发生图财害命事件，影响社会治安。在某些赌博盛行地区，已发生严重的危害社会秩序与生产的现象，并在部分的落后群众中，滋长着腐化堕落的恶劣风尚。
    为了厉行节约，发展生产，及杜绝坏分子破坏活动空隙，必须严厉禁止赌博。办法是：一、立即明令严禁赌博并协同各人民团体动员教育群众，议定公约，监督禁止一切赌博或变象赌博行为。并明文规定，经过教育劝告，而仍不改的处罚规章，违者依章处理。二、各级领导机关须对村干部民兵的“带头”赌博行为，切实进行教育，令其立即改正，对屡教不改错误严重者，加重处分。三、对赌棍、游民，严格管制，强迫其劳动生产，禁止以赌博原因出卖在土改中所分得之土地财产。四、基本一环在于动员教育群众并建立群众公约，以群众的力量肃清赌博行为。采用各种方式如报纸、群众会、黑板报、屋顶广播与通过群众团体进行广泛深入的宣传教育，说明赌博的害处：“赌博是地主资产阶级没落腐化思想行动的反映，赌博游荡不劳动生产是可耻的。旧社会因赌博倾家荡产鬻妻卖子；现在不仅使生活贫困，家庭不睦，且会遭到群众之反对，亲友藐视。如果因赌博而抢劫偷盗，则将受到法律惩处”。更从积极方面提倡节约储蓄，生产发家。经过宣传教育，提高群众觉悟，启发群众自行定出公约，大家遵守，互相监督。上述数点，希各地迅速研究，贯彻执行，并将执行情形及时上报。
