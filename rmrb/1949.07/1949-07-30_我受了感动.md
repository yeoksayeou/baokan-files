　　I Was Moved
　　Chen Shufeng
　　My home is in Qin County, in the old Yuebei liberated area. Not long after the Anti-Japanese War, amidst the retreating sounds of the Kuomintang bandit troops, in the chaotic state of runaway soldiers burning and looting everywhere, in the unsettling anxiety and despair of the people, the People's beloved Eighth Route Army marched in from the west. Also, the Death-Defying First Column, led by the Chinese Communist Party member Comrade Bo Yibo, came, clearing away the chaos, stabilizing the people's hearts, spreading propaganda about resisting Japan, and organizing and arming the people. When the Japanese came to attack, the Communists led the people to fight the Japanese devils together, sharing weal and woe with the people, fighting bloody battles for a full eight years, crushing countless cruel mopping-up operations by the enemy, and experiencing countless hardships before finally achieving the final victory. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, I consistently did not leave my hometown of Qin County. It wasn't until the summer of 1945, when local counter-offensives had already begun everywhere and were approaching a major counter-offensive, that I left Qin County, but I was still in the Taiyue area. Therefore, I personally experienced the entire eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, from beginning to victory. The eight-year Anti-Japanese War behind enemy lines was filled with blood and tears, and there were countless people's heroes who shed their last drop of blood to defend the motherland. The glorious history of the Chinese nation's eight-year Anti-Japanese War was written with the blood of countless people's heroes; it is filled with countless heroic and moving deeds, but too little has been written about them. "Heroes and Heroines," which comprehensively depicts the Anti-Japanese War from beginning to victory, is the first one I have seen.
　　Although "Heroes and Heroines" is based on Baiyangdian in Central Hebei, it depicts the situation of the entire liberated areas behind enemy lines during the Anti-Japanese War; it shows how the liberated areas behind enemy lines, under the leadership of the Communist Party, experienced eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. The only differences are the specific stories and, due to geographical factors, minor differences in certain struggle methods and approaches. During the Anti-Japanese War, all liberated areas behind enemy lines were opened up under the guidance of Chairman Mao's policy of "Wherever the enemy attacks, we attack." Because they were all dealing with a common enemy and were all under Chairman Mao's unified strategic guidance, they all experienced the same process. When I read about the "May" mopping-up operation in "Heroes and Heroines," I felt it was like the "Iron Roller" mopping-up operation in the Taiyue area in the autumn of 1943. After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, the anti-Japanese banner that the people of Central Hebei admired was "Commander Lü," and the anti-Japanese banner that the people of Taiyue admired was "Director Bo"... In short, "Heroes and Heroines" is a good work depicting the Anti-Japanese struggle. I felt very close to it when I read it. Those characters and stories felt like I had seen them before. Therefore, I was moved!

　　我受了感动
    陈树峰
    我的家在岳北老解放区沁县，抗战以后不久，在国民党匪军的败退声中，在到处是溃兵乱烧乱抢的混乱状态之中，在人心惶惶的不安和绝望之中，从西边开来了人民所敬爱的八路军。还开来了中国共产党人薄一波同志领导下的决死一纵队，肃清了溃乱，安定了人心，到处宣传抗日，把人民组织起来武装起来。当日本人打来的时候，共产党人领导着人民一块儿和日本鬼子干，与人民同甘苦共患难，浴血抗战整整八年，粉碎了敌人无数次残酷的扫荡，经历了无数的艰难困苦，才取得了最后的胜利。在八年抗战中，我一贯的没有离开过我的家乡沁县，直到一九四五年夏天已经到处的开始局部反攻，并已接近大反攻的时候，我才离开了沁县，但还在太岳区，所以八年抗战从开始到胜利，我是亲身经历了的。在敌后八年抗日战争中，充满了血和泪，有无数的人民英雄，为了保卫祖国，流了自己的最后一滴鲜血。中华民族八年抗战的光荣历史，是用无数人民英雄的鲜血写成的；里边充满了无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹，但是写出来的太少了，象“新儿女英雄传”这样从抗战开始到胜利全面写出来的，我所见到的还是第一部。
    “新儿女英雄传”，虽然取材于冀中白洋淀，但它写出了在抗战中整个敌后解放区的情形；写出了在共产党领导下的敌后解放区，是怎样的经历了八年抗战；所不同的只不过是具体故事的不同，以及由于地域的关系，在某些斗争方法方式上的小异。在抗日战争中，所有的敌后解放区，都是在毛主席的“敌人打到哪里，我们打到哪里”的方针指导之下开辟的，因为都是对付一个共同的敌人，又都是在毛主席统一的战略指导之下，因而都经历了相同的过程。当我读到“新儿女英雄传”中的“五月”大扫荡时，我觉得好象太岳区一九四三年秋天的“铁滚”大扫荡；抗战开始后，冀中人民所敬仰的一面抗日旗帜是“吕司令”，太岳人民所敬仰的一面抗日旗帜是“薄主任”…总之，新儿女英雄传是一部描写抗日斗争的好作品，我读了感到非常亲切，那些人物、故事、仿佛我都曾经见过了的，因此，我受了感动！
