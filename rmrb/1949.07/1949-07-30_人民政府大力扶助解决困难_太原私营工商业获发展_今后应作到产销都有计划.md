【Taiyuan Telegram】Taiyuan's private industry and commerce, under the firm implementation of the policy of protecting legitimate private industry and commerce by the Taiyuan Military Control Commission and the People's Government, and with active assistance to industrialists and businessmen in resolving practical difficulties and ideological concerns, has achieved rapid recovery and development. According to statistics from the city on July 18th, the number of industrial and commercial enterprises in the city has increased to 2,333, an increase of 240 compared to the 2,093 in June, and an increase of 133% compared to the 1,000 actually operating before liberation. For example, in the city's cotton weaving industry, the sound of looms had not been heard for twenty months before liberation. Now, more than 120 looms have been started. In the ironworking, electric milling, carpentry, and oil industries, 52 electric motors have been started. Among the original 337 handicraft businesses, 309 have resumed operations, and 48 new ones have been added. The achievement of these results is primarily due to the correct leadership of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Taiyuan Military Control Commission, and the Taiyuan People's Government. Over the past two months, they have resolutely implemented our party's correct urban policy and industrial and commercial policies, held two large-scale symposiums and countless small-scale symposiums and industry meetings, repeatedly explaining the Chinese Communist Party's urban policy and economic policy, dispelling the ideological concerns of industrialists and businessmen, actively developing operations, and resolutely implementing the policy of protecting industry and commerce. Since entering the city, no legitimate industrial or commercial enterprise has been violated, and the private industrial and commercial property that was previously violated by the Yan Faction has been returned to 13 businesses. In order to correctly resolve labor-capital relations, on June 18th and 20th, the Taiyuan Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions and the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government respectively held symposiums for workers and factory owners of private factories. At the workers' symposium, it was pointed out that guaranteeing workers' democratic rights, organizing workers to study, and stipulating the length of apprenticeships were things that could be done immediately. Balancing wages with state-owned factories, solving the problem of illness and medical care, and implementing a Sunday system should also be gradually achieved in the future development of production. The meeting also called on workers to take on the responsibility of restoring and developing production, work actively, abide by factory rules, and help the factory to make comprehensive production plans. At the factory owners' meeting, Lai Ruoyu, Deputy Director of the Military Control Commission, systematically exposed the deceitful propaganda of Yan Xishan's "sweet first, then bitter" based on the general line of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. Mayor Pei Lisheng and Ma Zhen, Deputy Director of the Taiyuan Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, repeatedly explained the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital. After the meeting, the resumption of work and business gradually increased.

Secondly, assistance was given to industrialists and businessmen to solve practical difficulties. In order to solve the capital difficulties of industrialists and businessmen, the Taiyuan Branch of the People's Bank of China organized 30 million yuan in industrial and commercial loans, of which 10 million yuan has already been lent, and the remainder will be fully released by the end of July. In order to regulate materials, trade companies have supplied the market with 7,810,000 catties of grain, 190,000 catties of oil, 700,000 catties of salt, 18,774 bolts of foreign cloth, and 4,100,000 square feet of native cloth in the past two months. It also supported 32 cotton weaving factories, restored 104 looms, 50 electric mills, and a soap and knitting industry through the method of exchanging grain for flour and yarn for cloth. Electricity fees were reduced by one-quarter, and with the approval of the North China People's Government, industrial and commercial taxes and war service rice were exempted for May and June.

However, there are still two major problems in the development of industry and commerce in Taiyuan. One is the issue of planning in production and sales. Due to the long-term isolation between urban and rural areas, it is still difficult to grasp the law of what to produce, how much to sell, how much raw material is needed, and whether it can be supplied. The other is the issue of reforming the old industry associations. There are still individual industrial and commercial capitalists who attempt to use industry associations to control the entire industry. When the trade company and Yongtai Yu electric mill tested the exchange of grain for flour, with 100 catties of wheat exchanged for 87 catties of white flour, the electric mill made a profit, but the electric mill industry association decided that everyone could not establish contracts according to this standard. They set prices and restricted free business. The owner of Jinhechang Restaurant said: "I can make a profit by charging 80 catties of millet to cover a person's meals, but the association decided that no one is allowed to do so for less than 100 catties, so I dare not do business even if I have it." Therefore, reforming the old industry associations to truly serve the development of industry and commerce is also one of the most urgent tasks in the current development of industry and commerce in Taiyuan.

　　人民政府大力扶助解决困难
  　太原私营工商业获发展
    今后应作到产销都有计划
    【太原电】太原市私营工商业，在该市军管会和人民政府，坚决贯彻执行保护正当私营工商业政策，并积极帮助工商业者解决实际困难和思想顾虑下，已得到迅速恢复和发展。据该市七月十八日统计，全市工商业已增至二千三百三十三户，比六月份的二千零九十三户，增加了二百四十户，和解放前实际经营的一千户比较则增加了百分之一百三十三。如该市的棉织业，解放前已有二十个月没有听到织布机的声音了，现在已开动织布机一百二十余台，铁工、电磨、木工、油脂等业，已开动电动机五十二部，原有手工业三百三十七家中，除已有三百零九家复业以外，又新添四十八家。这些成绩的获得，首先是由于该市中共太原市委会、太原军管会和太原人民市政府的正确领导，两个月来坚决贯彻了我党正确的城市政策和工商业政策，召开了两次较大规模的座谈会和无数次的小型座谈会、行业会，反复阐明中国共产党的城市政策、经济政策，解除工商业者思想顾虑，积极发展经营，并坚决贯彻保护工商业的方针，入城以来没有一家正当的工商业被侵犯，而且将过去阎匪侵犯了的私营工商业财产，发还了十三家。为了正确解决劳资关系问题，六月十八、二十两日，华北职工总会太原办事处、太原市人民政府分别召开了私营工厂工人和厂主座谈会。在工人座谈会上，指出要保障工人民主权利，组织工人学习，规定学徒年限，是马上能够作到的；和公营工厂工资平衡，解决疾病医药问题，实行礼拜制，也要在将来发展生产中逐步作到。会上并号召工人要担负起恢复与发展生产的责任，积极劳动，遵守厂规，帮助厂方作出通盘生产计划。在厂主会上军管会赖若愚副主任，根据中国新民主主义革命的总路线，系统地揭穿了阎匪锡山“先甜后辣”的欺骗宣传，裴丽生市长和华北职工总会太原办事处副主任马真，反复说明了劳资两利的政策，会后复工复业就逐渐增多了。
    其次是帮助工商业者解决实际困难问题。为了解决工商业者资金困难，中国人民银行太原分行，举办了三千万元的工商业贷款，现已贷出一千万元，七月底即可全部放完。贸易公司为了调剂物资，两月来供应市场粮食七百八十一万斤，油十九万斤，盐七十万斤，洋布一万八千七百七十四匹，土布四百一十万方尺，棉纱三千八百三十七＠，并通过以粮换面，以纱换布的办法，扶植了三十二家棉织厂，恢复了一百零四台织布机，五十盘电磨及一部肥皂、针织等业，减低电费四分之一，并经华北人民政府批准，免征五、六两月份工商业税和战勤米。
    但目前在太原工商业发展道路上还存在着两大问题。一是生产和推销的计划性问题，由于长时期的城乡隔离，生产什么？推销多少？原料需要若干？能否供给？这一规律现在还很难掌握。一是改造旧的行业公会问题。现在还有个别工商业资本家，企图利用行业公会统制全行。当贸易公司和永泰裕电磨厂试验以粮换面后，一百斤小麦换八十七斤白面，电磨厂即有利可图，但电磨业公会议定大家都不能以此标准订立合同，他们规定价格，限制自由营业。晋和昌饭铺铺掌说：“我收八十斤小米包一个人的饭就有利了，但公会议定不到一百斤谁也不许包，所以我有买卖也不敢作”。因此，改造旧的行业公会，使之直正为发展工商业服务，也是太原市当前发展工商问题中最迫切的工作之一。
