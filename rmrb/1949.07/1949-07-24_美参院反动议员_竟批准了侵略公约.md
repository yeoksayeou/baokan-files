Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 23rd—Reports from various sources: The U.S. Senate, after intense debate, approved the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty on the 21st. The North Atlantic Treaty, signed in Washington on April 4th, was submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 27th. On June 6th, after being passed by the Foreign Relations Committee, the treaty was submitted to the full Senate for discussion. Due to opposition from the American people and disagreements within both the Democratic and Republican parties, the Senate delayed the vote until the 21st. The voting process was very difficult. A group of Republican senators, led by Taft and Wherry, launched a last-minute attack before the treaty was voted on, engaging in tense debates with other Republican leaders such as Vandenberg. Both sides shouted loudly, their voices hoarse. Taft, Wherry, and others successively proposed three amendments, demanding the reservation of American "rights," specifically requiring that the United States not undertake the obligation to arm Western Europe with military supplies, and that the United States not use force without Congressional approval. Republican Senator Flanders said that the treaty would "cost billions of dollars, thereby weakening the American economy." Republican Senator Donnell said that approving the treaty was "an error in our lives." Seeing that the emotions of opposition and doubt were quite strong, Senate Speaker Connally hurriedly read a telegram from Secretary of State Acheson before the amendments were voted on, urging the rejection of all reservations by the opponents. This fact reflects the State Department's unease. After the three amendments were rejected, the Senate finally passed the treaty by a vote of eighty-two to thirteen.

　　美参院反动议员
  　竟批准了侵略公约
    【新华社北平二十三日电】各方报道：美参院于二十一日在激烈的争吵之后批准了侵略性的北大西洋公约。四月四日在华盛顿签字的北大西洋公约，于四月二十七日被提交参院外委会。六月六日，该约经外委会通过后则提交参院全体会议，由参院进行讨论。由于美国人民的反对及民主共和两党内部意见的分歧，参院延至二十一日始行表决。表决的进行是很不顺利的。以塔夫脱、惠利为首的一部分共和党参议员，在表决该公约之前，发动了最后一分钟的攻击，并与共和党的另一首脑范登堡等展开紧张的争论。双方均大声喊叫，喉哑音嘶。塔夫脱与惠利等曾先后提出三个修正案，要求保留美国的“权利”，特别要求规定美国不得承担以军火武装西欧的义务，美国未得国会批准，不得使用武力等。共和党参议员佛兰德斯说：公约将“耗费数以十亿计的金钱，从而削弱美国的经济”。共和党参议员邓纳尔说：批准公约是“我们生活中的一个错误”。鉴于反对与怀疑的情绪相当强烈，参院议长康纳利连忙在表决修正案之前，宣读国务卿艾奇逊呼吁否决反对者一切保留的电报。这一事实，反映了国务院的心神不安。在三个修正案被否决后，参院始以八十二票对十三票通过该公约。
