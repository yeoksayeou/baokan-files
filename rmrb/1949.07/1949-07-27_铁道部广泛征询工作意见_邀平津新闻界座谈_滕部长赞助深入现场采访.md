    [Ping Municipal News] On the afternoon of the 25th of this month at 2:30 PM, the Railway Department of the Military Commission invited representatives of the press from Beijing and Tianjin to hold the third symposium in the conference room of the Ministry of Railways. More than 20 news workers from various units attended. Minister Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Director of the Transportation Bureau Zhen Tao, and Director of the Locomotive Bureau Ma Jun also attended and reported. Minister Teng reported on the proceedings of the National Railway Workers' Temporary Representative Conference, believing that experiences in trade union work from various regions were exchanged at the conference, and the Factory Management Committee was discussed, along with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' constitution and workers' welfare issues. He also spoke about the People's Railway's emergency repairs and traffic resumption. The completion of this task must mobilize the masses, especially rely on workers. Reporters from various newspapers spoke one after another. Comrade Jin Sha from the People's Daily raised many suggestions for improvement regarding the delays on the Beijing-Shanghai through train and the equipment on board. Comrade Wang Julin from the Workers' Daily suggested that reporters should go deep into the field. Meng Qiujiang, the interviewing director of the Progress Daily, pointed out that reporters from various newspapers should abandon the old concept of grabbing news and conduct planned division of labor and cooperation to conduct in-depth on-site interviews and produce typical reports. Finally, Minister Teng summarized everyone's opinions, believing that this symposium was more fruitful than the previous two, and the opinions raised by everyone greatly helped the leadership of the Ministry of Railways understand the situation. He agreed with reporters going to the field to conduct in-depth interviews with a focus, in order to use the summary reports from the old areas to guide the work in the new areas. In the future, he is willing to provide various conveniences and assistance to reporters for in-depth on-site interviews.
