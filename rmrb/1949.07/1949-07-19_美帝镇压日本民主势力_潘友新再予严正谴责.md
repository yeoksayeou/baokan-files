Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: TASS, Washington dispatch: At the Far Eastern Commission meeting on July 13th, Soviet representative Pan Youxin condemned MacArthur's repressive measures against Japanese workers and other progressive elements. Pan Youxin pointed out that the issue of MacArthur's violation of the Potsdam Proclamation and the policy decisions of the Far Eastern Commission was raised by the Soviet delegation as early as September 16, 1948. Although this issue has been on the agenda of the Far Eastern Commission for more than ten months, it has not yet been properly considered or a clear decision made.

As is well known, MacArthur's direct violation of these resolutions is evident in his letter to the Japanese government on July 22, 1948, in which he demanded a ban on collective contracts and strike calls by employees of state-owned enterprises and institutions. This anti-democratic measure is reflected in the amendments to the "Civil Service Law" and the "Public Enterprise Labor Relations Law" passed by the Japanese Parliament on November 30 and December 11, 1948, respectively. Because the American representative defended MacArthur's illegal actions, the Far Eastern Commission has not yet made a decision on this issue.

The Soviet delegation's statement also pointed out that MacArthur's other violations of the Potsdam Proclamation and the Far Eastern Commission's decisions, especially the so-called "economic stabilization" measures that have been implemented in Japan, are aimed at opposing the democratic forces in Japan.

The amendments made to Japanese labor law have created a situation in which workers employed by state-owned or private enterprises who participate in any form of labor dispute may not only be dismissed but may also be subjected to the most brutal reprisals, including court persecution and imprisonment. Instead of taking practical measures to stabilize Japan's peaceful economy, the American occupation authorities and the Japanese government have used "economic stabilization" as a pretext to launch an offensive against Japanese democratic forces, using a system of police violence and implementing large-scale political repression, and encouraging police violence against participants in rallies and demonstrations, arresting and imprisoning Japanese trade union leaders and progressive elements by the dozens.

The statement concluded: The Soviet delegation believes that the Far Eastern Commission cannot ignore this situation. The Soviet delegation believes that it is necessary for the Far Eastern Commission to take immediate action on this issue.

    美帝镇压日本民主势力
    潘友新再予严正谴责
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社华盛顿讯：在七月十三日的远东委员会会议上，苏联代表潘友新谴责麦克阿瑟对日本工人与其他进步分子所采取的镇压措施。潘友新指出，麦克阿瑟违背波茨坦公告与远东委员会的政策决议问题，早在一九四八年九月十六日即为苏联代表团提出。虽然这一问题列入远东委员会议程已达十阅月以上，但直到现在尚未被适当考虑，也未通过明确的决定。
    如所周知，麦克阿瑟对这些决议的直接违背，可见于他在一九四八年七月二十二日致日本政府的函件中，他在该函中要求禁止国营企业与机关的职工缔订集体合同和号召罢工。这一反民主措施，已反映于日本议会于一九四八年十一月三十日及十二月十一日分别通过的修正“公务员法”及“公共事业劳工关系法”中。由于美国代表为麦克阿瑟的非法措施辩护，远东委员会直到现在为止，尚未通过对这一问题的决定。
    苏联代表团的声明也指明，麦克阿瑟对波茨坦公告与远东委员会决定的其他违反，特别是业已在日本实行的所谓“经济稳定”措施，是反对日本民主力量的。
    日本劳动法中所作的修改，已形成这种形势，即当国营或私营企业所雇的工人参加任何形式的劳工纠纷时，他们不仅可能被解雇，而且可能受到最残酷的报复，包括法庭迫害与监禁。美国占领当局与日本政府不但未采取实际稳定日本和平经济的措施，而且以“经济稳定”为借口，发动了对日本民主力量的攻势，使用了警察暴力统治的制度，采取大规模的政治镇压，并鼓励对大会与示威的参加者施行警察暴力，成十成百地逮捕与监禁日本职工会的领袖与进步分子。
    声明最后称：苏联代表团认为，远东委员会不能无视这种形势。苏联代表团以为，远东委员会对这一问题立即采取决定是必要的。
