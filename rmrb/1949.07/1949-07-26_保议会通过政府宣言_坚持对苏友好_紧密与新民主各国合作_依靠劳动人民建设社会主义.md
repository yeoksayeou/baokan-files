Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25th: TASS, Sofia: The special session of the Bulgarian National Assembly, lasting five days, concluded on the 23rd. The meeting elected Kolarov as Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, Chervenkov and others as Vice-Chairmen, approved the government declaration, and passed new laws such as the National Assembly Member Election Law.

　　The government declaration was presented by Kolarov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, at the meeting on the 23rd. Kolarov pointed out that the government headed by him and the government formed according to Dimitrov's proposal on December 11, 1947, are the same government and will continue to rely on the Fatherland Front. He declared: The main responsibility for governing the country will naturally be borne by the Bulgarian Communist Party in the future, but the government will make every effort to strengthen the prestige of the Fatherland Front. Kolarov continued: Dimitrov's death will not cause changes in the government's domestic and foreign policies. The Bulgarian government fully shares Dimitrov's deep belief that only with the assistance of the Soviet Union and close cooperation with the People's Democratic countries can and will socialism be built in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government will unswervingly follow the policy of sincere friendship towards the Soviet Union and the Soviet government headed by Stalin, the great friend and defender of the Bulgarian people. The Bulgarian government will enthusiastically work to develop and consolidate the friendly relations between the Bulgarian people and the people of other countries with People's Democratic governments. In the future, the Bulgarian government will also firmly stand on the side of the world peace front and support any initiative aimed at strengthening world peace, and first and foremost, strengthening Balkan peace and good neighborly relations. Kolarov stated: The government will also vigilantly defend the territorial integrity, national independence, and sovereignty of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and resolutely counter any attempt to interfere in its internal affairs, and any attempt to harm the honor and dignity of the freedom-loving Bulgarian people.

　　When discussing the tasks of domestic policy, Kolarov emphasized that the government will now concentrate on solving the country's economic problems. He said: As a true people's regime, the government of the Fatherland Front cannot have any task more important today than encouraging the creative efforts of the urban and rural working people to implement the national economic plan. Coming from the working people and relying solely on the support of the working people, the government has nothing more important than ensuring the welfare of the people.

　　After reading the government declaration, the meeting held discussions. The speakers fully agreed with the government declaration and expressed their determination to do everything possible to realize it. Subsequently, a vote was taken, and it was unanimously passed by the parliament.

　　保议会通过政府宣言
  　坚持对苏友好
  　紧密与新民主各国合作
    依靠劳动人民建设社会主义
    【新华社北平二十五日电】塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚国民议会特别会议在历时五天之后，已于二十三日闭幕。会议曾选出科拉罗夫为保加利亚部长会议主席，契尔文科夫等为副主席，批准了政府宣言，并通过了国民议会议员选举法等新法律。政府宣言由部长会议主席科拉罗夫于二十三日在会议上提出。科拉罗夫指出，以他为首的政府和按照季米特洛夫在一九四七年十二月十一日的建议所组成的政府，是同一的政府，并将继续依靠祖国阵线。他宣称：治理国家的主要责任，在将来也自然是由保加利亚共产党来担负的，但是，政府将尽一切努力加强祖国阵线的威信。科拉罗夫继称：季米特洛夫的逝世，不引起政府的内政与外交政策的改变。保加利亚政府完全与季米特洛夫有共同的深切信念，即只有在苏联的援助下，与人民民主国家紧密合作下，社会主义才能够而且将要在保加利亚建立起来。保加利亚政府将坚持不渝地遵循对苏联及以保加利亚人民的伟大朋友和保卫者——斯大林为首的苏维埃政府真诚友好的政策。保加利亚政府将热心地工作，以发展与巩固保加利亚人民与其他拥有人民民主政府的各国的人民之间的友好关系。保加利亚政府在将来也将稳固地站在世界和平阵线方面，并支持任何旨在加强世界和平、而首先是加强巴尔干和平与睦邻关系的倡议。科拉罗夫称：政府也将警醒地保卫保加利亚人民共和国的领土完整，民族独立和主权，并对任何干涉其内政的企图，对任何损害爱好自由的保加利亚人民的荣誉与威严的企图，予以坚决的反击。论及内政政策的任务时，科拉罗夫强调政府现在将集中力量解决保国的经济问题。他说：作为真正的人民政权，祖国阵线的政府，在今天不能有任何比以鼓励城乡劳动人民进行创造性的努力来执行国家经济计划这一任务更为重要的了。从劳动人民中来的，和唯有依赖劳动人民支持的政府，没有什么比保证人民的福利更为紧要关切的事。在宣读政府宣言之后，会议进行讨论，各发言者完全赞成政府宣言，表示决心尽一切力量来实现它。其后，进行票决，经议会全体一致通过。
