Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: TASS, New York - The United Nations Secretariat published on July 14th a report prepared by the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East on the economic situation of countries in Asia and the Far East. The report acknowledges that the economic situation in these countries has deteriorated sharply. Key figures indicate that the current economic situation in India, Japan, South Korea, Burma, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Siam, Pakistan, and other Asian countries is far worse than before the war.

Deteriorating Economies of Colonial Countries Under U.S. Imperialist Aggression

The report points out that industrial and agricultural production in these countries is clearly unsatisfactory and has not yet recovered to pre-war levels. In 1948, coal production in Asia and the Far East only reached 70% of pre-war levels, and iron ore production only reached one-third of pre-war levels. The production of steel and pig iron has also sharply declined, hindering the recovery and development of Asian and Far Eastern countries. Cotton harvests are 13% lower than before the war. Currently, livestock numbers are at 85% of pre-war levels. Rice and other grain production have plummeted, so that some Asian and Far Eastern countries that were rice exporters before the war have become importers of rice and other grains. Aquatic product production has decreased by 50%.

The report mentions the difficult financial situations of Asian and Far Eastern countries. Local banking systems are still in their infancy, while foreign banks occupy an important position in the banking systems of these countries. The report directly points out that the business of foreign banks mainly involves providing funds for foreign trade, and they pay very little attention to the economic development of Asian and Far Eastern countries. Although these countries are facing difficult financial situations, their military expenditures are constantly increasing. For example, even according to official figures, Burma's military appropriations for 1948 increased by 21% compared to pre-war levels, and India's increased by 10%.

The report indicates that the difficult economic and financial situation of Asian and Far Eastern countries in the post-war period is also a direct consequence of the reduction in these countries' foreign trade. Before the war, the foreign trade of these countries was relatively balanced, but after the war, almost every country had a huge foreign trade deficit. One of the main reasons cited in the report is the increasing dependence of Asian and Far Eastern countries on imports of American goods; the United States has become the main supplier for these countries. U.S. exports to Asia and the Far East far exceed U.S. imports from these countries. In 1948, U.S. exports to Burma were 19 times U.S. imports from Burma. U.S. exports to Indonesia were 8.9 times U.S. imports from Indonesia. The trade situation between Asian and Far Eastern countries and Britain is the same. The report points out that due to these reasons, the trade deficits of Asian and Far Eastern countries are so large that they pose a serious threat to the international financial situation of these countries.

The governments of these countries are shifting the entire burden of economic difficulties onto the working people. The report points out that the people of these countries, who account for more than half of the world's total population, are living in distress and poverty. Even according to official government statistics, real wages in India and Pakistan in 1948 decreased by 13% compared to 1939. In Malaya and Singapore, they decreased by 25%. Real wages in the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia have plummeted.

The report mentions the increase in the number of strikes in Asian and Far Eastern countries. According to official figures, there were 820 strikes in 1945, and 1,393 strikes in 1948. The emergency laws implemented during the war remain in effect in most Asian and Far Eastern countries.

The Lives of the Liberated Chinese and North Korean People are Constantly Improving

The report also acknowledges that in liberated China and North Korea, the living conditions of the people are constantly improving. The report points out that the land reforms implemented in the aforementioned two countries have transferred the land of landlords and the land seized by Japanese warriors to the people. The report also states that in South Korea, the land seized by the Japanese was not returned to the people, but was transferred to the so-called "New Korean Company" according to the orders of the U.S. military authorities, and the "company" intends to sell these lands.

Although the report has many shortcomings, it is enough to show what the results of the rule of the United States, Britain, France, and other colonialists in Asia and the Far East are.

    联合国秘书处发表
    亚洲及远东经济情况
    【新华社北平十六日电】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国秘书处于七月十四日发表联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会所拟制的亚洲及远东国家经济情况的报告。报告承认：这些国家的经济情况，已剧烈恶化。各个主要的数字说明：印度、日本、南朝鲜、缅甸、菲律宾、越南、印尼、暹罗、巴基斯坦及亚洲其他国家目前的经济情况，比战前恶劣得多。
    美帝侵略下各殖民地国家经济益恶化
    报告指出：这些国家的工业及农业生产，显然不能令人满意，并且尚未恢复战前水平。一九四八年亚洲及远东国家的煤产量，只达到战前产量的百分之七十，铁砂产量仅达到战前产量的三分之一。钢和铣铁的产量也已锐减，它妨碍了亚洲及远东国家的复员和开发。棉花收获量比战前低百分之十三。目前，牲畜的数目是战前的百分之八十五。米和其他谷物的产量锐跌，以致战前是米出口国的某些亚洲及远东国家，已变成米和其他谷物的进口国。水产品产量已减少百分之五十。
    报告中提到亚洲及远东国家困难的财政情况。本地银行制度还是在幼稚时期，而外国银行则在这些国家的银行系统中占据重要地位。报告直接指出：外国银行的业务，主要是在供应对外贸易的资金，它们对亚洲及远东国家的经济发展极少注意。虽然这些国家的财政情形困难，但它们的军费开支则在不断增加。譬如说，甚至根据官方的数字，缅甸一九四八年的军费拨款，都比战前增加百分之二十一，印度增加百分之十。
    报告指出，战后期间亚洲及远东国家经济及财政的困难情况，也是这些国家对外贸易减少的直接后果。战前，这些国家的对外贸易较为平衡，而在战后，这些国家几乎每国都有巨额的对外贸易的亏空。报告列举的主要原因之一，是亚洲及远东国家对美货进口的日益依赖，美国已成为这些国家的主要供给国。美国向亚洲及远东国家的输出，比美国从这些国家的输入多得多。一九四八年，美国向缅甸的输出，是美国从缅甸输入的十九倍。美国向印尼的输出，是美国从印尼输入的八点九倍。亚洲及远东国家与英国之间贸易的情况也是一样。报告指出：由于这些原因，亚洲及远东国家的贸易入超数额颇大，以致成为对于这些国家国际金融情况的严重威胁。
    这些国家的政府，正在把经济困难的整个负担转嫁给劳动人民。报告指出：占世界总人口半数以上的这些国家的人民，是生活在困苦与贫穷的情况中。甚至根据政府的官方统计，印度及巴基斯坦一九四八年的实际工资，比一九三九年减少了百分之十三。马来亚及新加坡，则减少了百分之二十五。菲律宾、日本及印尼的实际工资已锐降。
    报告提到亚洲及远东国家罢工次数的增加。根据官方数字，一九四五年罢工八百二十次，一九四八年则罢工一千三百九十三次。战时所施行的紧急法律，在大多数亚洲及远东国家仍然保持有效。
    解放的中国及北鲜人民生活不断改善
    报告同时承认，在已解放的中国及北朝鲜，人民的生活状况则在不断地改善。报告指出：上述两国所实行的土地改革，已把地主的土地以及日本武士所夺取的土地交给人民。报告又称，在南朝鲜，被日本人夺取的土地没有还给人民，而是依照美国军事当局的命令移交给所谓“新朝鲜公司”，该“公司”打算出卖这些土地。
    虽然报告有许多欠缺，但是，它已足以说明美、英、法及其他殖民者在亚洲及远东国家内统治的结果是怎样的了。
