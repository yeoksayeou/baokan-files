Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 8th: TASS, New York: The economic situation of capitalist countries is rapidly deteriorating. The United Nations Secretariat released the first part of a report on the world economic situation in 1948 on July 4th. The report includes a survey of the global economic situation in 1948 and the first quarter of 1949. The report acknowledges that the world economic situation, particularly the economic situation in the United States, has deteriorated. The report points out that the second half of 1948 and the beginning of 1949 were clearly a turning point in post-war economic development. Since the end of the war, price declines, interrupted production expansion, and increased unemployment have begun in several countries. In early 1949, a significant increase in unemployment was seen in several Western European countries and the United States. For the first time since the war, the trend of contraction appeared in the form of reduced economic activity or factors foreshadowing such a reduction.

The figures cited in the report show that the number of unemployed in the United States in the first quarter of 1949 increased by almost 70% compared to the last quarter of 1948. The number of unemployed in Italy has reached two million, and in West Germany, it has exceeded one million. In the first quarter of 1949, there were approximately 400,000 unemployed in the United Kingdom. In March 1949, about 12% of all workers in Belgium were unemployed, compared to 7% in March 1948.

Simultaneous with the increase in unemployment, the cost of living in several countries continues to rise. In France, the cost of living at the end of 1948 had more than doubled compared to the beginning of 1947. In Canada, the cost of living in 1948 was 25% higher than in 1946. In India, due to a significant drop in real income per person, per capita grain consumption was 15% lower than the lowest average annual amount between 1934 and 1938.

The report points out that unmet demand for consumer goods and equipment accumulated during the war guaranteed increased output after the war. However, now, due to the depletion of people's savings, the demand for consumer goods has been greatly reduced.

In the United States, in 1948, forced accumulation of unsold goods could be seen. The problem of selling goods in the United States, Belgium, Italy, and West Germany is particularly acute. However, the level of consumption per capita in many capitalist countries is much lower than before the war.

The report points out that in 1948, the industrial production of all countries in the world (including the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies) was 11% higher than in 1947 and one-third higher than in 1937. However, according to the materials in the report, it can be seen that the rate of increase in industrial production is very uneven: in 1948, the industrial production of the Soviet Union was 27% higher than in 1947; however, taking the United States as an example, in 1948, industrial production was only 3% higher than in 1947. In the first quarter of 1949, industrial production in the United States decreased by 5%, of which the production of machinery manufacturing decreased by 9%. In the first quarter of 1949, the industrial production of the Soviet Union increased by 23% compared to the first quarter of 1948.

The report points out that in Europe outside the Soviet Union, industrial production is still below the level of 1947. The increase in industrial production in Canada stopped at the beginning of 1949. The industrial production of Latin American countries began to decline in 1948, especially in the light industry sector, which is the main industrial sector of Latin American countries. In the Middle East, emerging local industries are reducing production because they cannot compete with industrialized capitalist countries. In Asia, production is far below pre-war levels. In Japan, under American occupation, production in 1948 was only one-third of the pre-war level.

According to the report, signs indicate that in 1949, it will be difficult for the industrial output of European countries other than the Soviet Union to maintain the same rate of development as in 1948. The level of production in the second half of 1948 was lower than in the first half of the same year; statistics for the first three months of 1949 also show that the speed of industrial development is generally decreasing.

The report points out that in many countries in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa, the production of raw materials that began during the war is now decreasing. At the same time, the production of raw materials in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries is developing greatly. The report states that the textile industry in several countries is experiencing great difficulties due to the United States seizing positions in world trade. The Italian textile industry in 1947 only reached 77% of the pre-war level, and began to decline again in 1948. The textile products of Belgium and France were lower than the pre-war level in 1948, and are now declining. Japan, which was once known as one of the largest textile production centers in Asia before the war, now has a textile industry output that is only 17% of the pre-war level.

In 1948, except for the Soviet Union, agricultural production in Western European countries and agricultural production in Asia were lower than pre-war levels. Grain production in Europe was approximately equivalent to 87% of the annual average from 1934 to 1938; while the Soviet Union had restored grain production to pre-war levels in 1948.

The report emphasizes that despite the great increase in world food production, per capita consumption in most countries has had to remain below pre-war levels, and this level cannot meet minimum needs.

The struggle for markets is intensifying. In 1948, the United States, which squeezed several countries (primarily Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom) out of the world market, saw its exports more than double compared to before the war. At the same time, the exports of countries such as Sweden, Norway, and Austria were much lower than before the war. The United States' exports to most countries trading with the United States exceeded the United States' imports from these countries, making it increasingly difficult to pay for goods imported from the United States. As a result, despite the fact that US exports are subsidized under the Marshall Plan, exports have been falling since 1947. The United States' share of world exports fell from 26% in the first quarter of 1948 to 21% in the last quarter.

The report claims that trade between Western and Eastern European countries is only 42% of pre-war levels. However, accompanying the insufficient trade between the West and the East, trade between Eastern European countries and between these countries and the Soviet Union has expanded. In 1948, this trade constituted 288% of the 1938 level, while trade between Western European countries was only 72% of the pre-war figure. It is also evident that the expansion of trade between the West and the East can immediately facilitate the economic development of Eastern Europe and supply Western Europe with certain raw materials that must be imported from other continents.

The report concludes by pointing out that the difficulties in world trade, which should be overcome, prove to be even more serious than expected.

　　联合国秘书处发表世界经济形势报告
    资本主义世界经济急剧恶化　苏工农业产量逐年迅速增加
    【新华社北平八日电】塔斯社纽约讯：资本主义国家经济形势急剧恶化。联合国秘书处于七月四日发表了关于一九四八年世界经济形势报告的第一部分。报告包括对一九四八年和一九四九年第一季全世界经济形势的调查。报告承认，世界经济形势特别是美国的经济形势，已呈恶化。报告指出，一九四八年下半年和一九四九年初，显然是战后经济发展的转折点。自战争结束以来，在若干国家中，首先开始了物价下跌，生产扩展中断及失业人数增加。一九四九年初，在若干西欧国和美国，就看到失业的巨大增长。战争以来，紧缩的趋势首次以经济活动减少的形式，或以预示此种减少的因素出现。
    报告引证的数字表明，一九四九年第一季的美国失业数字，比之一九四八年最末一季几乎增加了百分之七十。意大利的失业数字已达二百万，西德已超过一百万。在一九四九年第一季，英国约有四十万失业者。在一九四九年三月，比利时约有全部工人的百分之十二无工作，而在一九四八年三月，这一数字尚为百分之七。
    与失业增加的同时，若干国家的生活费用则继续高涨。在法国，一九四八年底的生活费用，比之一九四七年初已增加二倍余。在加拿大，一九四八年的生活费用，比一九四六年高百分之二十五。在印度，由于每人实际收入的大大低落，每人的粮食消费比之一九三四年至一九三八年间每年的最低平均量还要低百分之十五。
    报告指出，未满足的消费品需求以及战时所积存的设备，保证了战后产量的增加。但现在，由于人民积蓄的耗尽，消费品的需求已大大地减削了。
    在美国，一九四八年，可以看到找不到销路的货物的被迫堆积。美国、比利时、意大利及西德的货物销售问题特别尖锐。而许多资本主义国家的国民每人消费水平，则比战前低得很多。
    报告指出，一九四八年，世界各国（包括苏联及人民民主国家在内）工业生产量比一九四七年高百分之十一，比一九三七年高三分之一。但是，根据报告中的材料来分析，可以看出，工业生产量增加率是很不平衡的：一九四八年，苏联工业生产量比一九四七年高百分之二十七；然而，以美国为例，在一九四八年，工业生产量只比一九四七年高百分之三。一九四九年第一季，美国工业生产量减低了百分之五，其中机器制造业生产量减低了百分之九。而一九四九年第一季，苏联的工业生产量则比一九四八年第一季增加了百分之二十三。
    报告指出，在苏联以外的欧洲，工业生产量仍然低于一九四七年的水平。加拿大工业生产量的增加，在一九四九年初已告停止。拉丁美洲国家的工业生产量，在一九四八年开始减低，特别是轻工业部门，而轻工业正是拉丁美洲国家的主要工业部门。在中东，新兴的本地工业，由于不能与工业发达的资本主义国家竞争，正在减产中。在亚洲，生产远落在战前水平之下。在美国占领下的日本，一九四八年的生产，仅及战前水平的三分之一。
    据报告所述，迹象显示：在一九四九年，除苏联以外，欧洲的工业出品，都很难在发展上与一九四八年保持同样的速度。一九四八年后半年的生产水平，低于同年的前半年；一九四九年前三个月的统计，也显示工业发展速度是一般的减少。
    报告指出：在拉丁美洲、中东和非洲的许多国家中，战时创始的原料生产，现在正减少中。而在同时，苏联及其他东欧国家的原料生产，却在大大地发展着。报告称：由于美国攫取若干国家在世界贸易中的阵地，以致后者的纺织工业极感困难。意大利的纺织业在一九四七年仅达战前水平的百分之七十七，一九四八年又开始下降。比、法两国的纺织品，在一九四八年低于战前水平，现在也下降了。战前曾以亚洲最大纺织品生产地之一著称的日本，现在的纺织工业出品仅及战前水平的百分之十七。
    在一九四八年，除苏联而外，西欧各国的农业生产以及亚洲的农业生产，都低于战前的水平。欧洲的谷类生产，大约相当于一九三四——三八年每年平均量的百分之八十七；而苏联，在一九四八年的谷类生产，则已恢复战前的水平。
    报告中强调，尽管世界粮食产量已大大增加，但是，多数国家中的每人消费量，却不得不滞留在战前水准以下，而这一水准是不能满足最低限度的需要的。
    争夺市场的斗争正在加紧着。在一九四八年，把若干国家（首先是德国、日本与英国）从世界市场上排挤出去的美国，其出口已较战前增加一倍。同时，瑞典、挪威、奥国等国的出口，则大大低于战前。美国对于多数对美通商国家的出口，超过了美国来自这些国家的人口，这使得支付从美国输入的货物越来越感困难。其结果，尽管美国的出口根据马歇尔计划获得津贴，但自一九四七年以来，出口即在下跌着。美国在世界出口中所占的比重，已由一九四八年第一季的百分之二十六，降低到末季的百分之二十一。
    报告声称，西欧各国与东欧各国间的贸易，仅及战前的百分之四十二。但是，伴随着西方与东方间的贸易不足，东欧各国之间以及这些国家与苏联之间的贸易却扩展了。一九四八年，这一贸易构成了一九三八年水平的百分之二百八十八，而西欧各国之间的贸易，则仅及战前数字的百分之七十二。这也是明显的，即西方与东方之间贸易的扩展，可以立即便利东欧的经济发展以及供给西欧某些必需从其他大陆输入的原料。
    报告于结语中指出，本应加以克服的世界贸易中的困难，证明比预料的尤为严重。
