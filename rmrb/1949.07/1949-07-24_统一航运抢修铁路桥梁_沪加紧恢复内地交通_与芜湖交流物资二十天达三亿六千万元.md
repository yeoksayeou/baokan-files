　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 23rd: Shanghai is intensifying various efforts to restore shipping and railway transportation to the interior. The Shipping Department of the Military Control Commission of the city, after taking over state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, China Towing & Salvage Company, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Shanghai Branch, Pudong Shipyard, and the Nanjing, Qingdao, Fuzhou and other port engineering bureaus in Shanghai, as well as the Shanghai Port Reorganization Committee and other units, has preliminarily sorted out a large number of ships. Together with those already sailing in various places, they account for approximately 66% of the total number of ships of these units. The work of salvaging ships sunk in the Huangpu River by the Kuomintang bandit troops is also continuing. Forty-seven ships have already been salvaged. All workers at the Pudong Shipyard are stepping up repairs to ships. The workers voluntarily requested to increase night shifts, and now work until 10 o'clock every night. The Shipping Department has also decided to unify the various branches of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company along the Yangtze River under the jurisdiction of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company headquarters to strengthen leadership over shipping along the Yangtze River. The Guidance Committee for private shipping has recently established an inland waterway shipping research committee to study various plans for building an inland waterway shipping system. Based on river distribution and actual conditions, it is planned to first engage in construction in five areas: the Sichuan River, Xiang River, Han River, Gan River, and Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui. In terms of railways, since the resumption of traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, the permanent repair project of the damaged bridge on the Beijing-Shanghai line and the large-scale repair project of the six major bridges on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line have started in mid-to-late June and will be completed by the end of this month. At the same time, important equipment for train operation, telecommunications, signals, etc., have also been repaired by the efforts of the staff. The Shanghai Railway Works Department has dispatched an engineering inspection team to conduct a major road maintenance inspection. To protect the railway and prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents, more than 100 employees of Shanghai North Station have formed a picket team to maintain railway order in coordination with the armed police. Since the beginning of June, they have cracked nearly ten cases involving armed special agents.
