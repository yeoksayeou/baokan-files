Tangshan Summarizes Six-Month Trade Union Work
    Output Generally Increased, but Neglect of Trade Unions is Increasing; Decision to Add Organizing Committee Members to Organize Industrial Trade Unions
    [Our Newspaper's News] The Tangshan Federation of Trade Unions Organizing Committee held an enlarged meeting of over 300 people on June 27th to summarize the trade union work of the past six months. If the six months are divided into two periods, the output of each factory and mine in the latter three months exceeded that of the former three months by one time, reaching the level before liberation. For example, the Railway Factory repaired an average of eight locomotives and 151 passenger and freight cars per month in the first three months; in the latter three months, the average increased to 21 locomotives and 248 passenger and freight cars. The Steel Plant increased from an average monthly output of 111.8 tons of steel ingots to 253.4 tons in the same period. Kailuan's average monthly output was 123,400 tons of coal in the first three months, and increased to an average monthly output of 240,363 tons in the latter three months. Qixin Cement Plant increased from an average monthly output of 5,800 tons of cement to 11,900 tons in the same period. Other public and private factories and mines, as well as small and medium-sized industries, also increased by 25 to 50 percent. During production, a large number of conscious activists who can take the lead have emerged, attention has begun to be paid to the issue of worker unity, and certain preparations have been made for trade union organizations. However, some shortcomings still exist in the work. First, insufficient attention is paid to worker welfare in general public enterprises, while some private factories simply emphasize worker welfare, are not concerned about production costs and product sales, do not make serious efforts to persuade and correct the absenteeism and slowdowns of a small number of workers, and allow serious unreasonable human organization and waste of raw materials to continue. Second, the leadership does not pay enough attention to trade union work. In Tangshan, which has more than 80,000 workers, there is still no formal trade union organization. The Qixin Cement Plant, with nearly 3,000 workers, does not even have a single member. Many problems have been solved for the workers, but mostly from top to bottom, without utilizing worker organizations. In addition, serious guild-like thinking hinders the class unity of workers and the development and growth of trade union organizations. In addition to calling on all workers and trade union cadres to deeply recognize and vigorously overcome the above shortcomings, the meeting also passed a resolution to organize industrial trade unions, add names to the organizing committee, and determine the current key tasks: (1) Strengthen worker unity, absorb a large number of members, and quickly establish formal trade union organizations. (2) Organize factory management committees and implement democratic factory management. (3) Conclude collective contracts in public factories and labor-capital contracts in private factories. (4) Organize worker cooperatives to protect workers' lives and solve worker welfare issues that can be resolved.

　　唐山总结半年工会工作
    产量普增但有忽视工会现象决增聘筹委组织各产业工会
    【本报讯】唐山市总工会筹委会六月二十七日召开三百多人的扩大会议，总结半年来的工会工作。如将半年分为两个时期，则后三个月各厂矿产量均超过前三个月的一倍，达到了解放前的水平。如铁路工厂前三个月平均每月修理机车八辆，客货车一百五十一辆；后三月平均每月修机车二十一辆，客货车二百四十八辆。制钢厂在同一时期由平均月产钢锭一百一十一点八吨，上升到二百五十三点四吨。开滦前三个月平均月产十二万三千四百吨煤，后三个月即增至平均月产二十四万零三百六十三吨。启新洋灰厂同一时期由平均月产洋灰五千八百吨增至一万一千九百吨。其他各公私厂矿及中小工业，也均增加百分之二十五到五十。在生产中，涌现出大批有觉悟的、能起带头作用的积极分子，职工团结问题也已开始注意，工会组织也作了一定的准备。但是，工作中仍存在某些缺点。首先是一般公营企业中对工人福利注意不够，而在某些私营工厂中又有人单纯强调工人福利，对生产成本、产品推销不关心，对少数工人的旷工、磨洋工不做认真的说服加以纠正，对严重的人力组织不合理、原料浪费，听之任之的现象。其次是领导上对工会工作重视不够，在八万余工人的唐山，至今还没有一个正式的工会组织，近三千人的启新洋灰厂，还没有一个会员。给工人解决了不少问题，但多是自上而下，没有运用工人组织。另外是严重的行帮思想，阻碍着工人的阶级团结与工会组织的发展壮大。会议除号召全体职工与工会干部深刻认识与大力克服上述缺点外，并通过组织各产业工会的决定，增聘筹委名单，及目前的工作要点：（一）加强职工团结，大量吸收会员，迅速建立正式工会组织。（二）组织工厂管理委员会，实行工厂管理民主化。（三）在公营工厂中订立集体合同，在私营工厂中订立劳资合同。（四）组织职工合作社，保障职工生活，解决可能解决的工人福利问题。
