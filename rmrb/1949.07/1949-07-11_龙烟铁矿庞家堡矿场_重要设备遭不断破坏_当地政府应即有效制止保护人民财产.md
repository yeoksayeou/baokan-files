　　Xuanhua Special Dispatch from our Newspaper: The Pangjiabao Mining Area of the Longyan Iron Mine, which belongs to the North China Steel Company, has been liberated by our army for nearly a year since August last year. A few illegal residents in the vicinity have often stolen and sold important equipment such as electrical equipment, trams, trains, aerial ropeways, air compressors, and air ducts of the mining area, and this has not stopped so far. From the 23rd to the 24th of this month, our reporter accompanied Sun Jingwen, the mayor of Zhangjiakou City, Sun Ming, the director of the Chahar Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and Ma Shuqian, the manager of the mine, to inspect the area. They saw that approximately more than 3,000 houses in the area had been demolished, most of the 77,000-volt high-voltage lines had been cut off and stolen, the substation had been completely destroyed, and hundreds of huge electric motors scattered in the pits (mostly 50 to 150 or 200 horsepower, the largest being 500 horsepower) had become scrap iron. According to Comrade Ge Zhenmin, who was guarding the mine, unscrupulous merchants from Pingjin frequently came to the mining area to buy copper and iron, and the Industry and Commerce Section of the Xuanhua Municipal People's Government also allowed a public-owned cooperative to send people to purchase near the mining area. This invisibly triggered destructive activities by a few bad elements. For this reason, the Chahar Provincial People's Government has repeatedly ordered the local Xuanhua, Longguan and other county governments to find ways to stop the destruction, but no results have been seen so far. We hope that the local government should correct its indifferent attitude towards the people's property, quickly mobilize the masses, educate the lawbreakers, formulate effective measures, and stop the destruction. We also hope that the People's Government will order merchants to be prohibited from purchasing copper and iron in the mining area. Note: The Pangjiabao mining area was the main mining area of the Longyan Iron Mine during the Japanese occupation. The electrical equipment in the mining area was extremely large. The daily output once reached more than 6,000 tons. According to the "North China Development Co." of the Japanese, the iron sand reserves in the area were 193 million tons.

　　龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场
    重要设备遭不断破坏
    当地政府应即有效制止保护人民财产
    【本报宣化专电】华北钢铁公司所属龙烟铁矿庞家堡采矿场，自去年八月间为我军解放后，为时近一载，附近少数不法居民对该矿场电气、电车、火车、索道、压风机、风管等重要设备时常盗卖，且迄今仍未停止。本月二十三日至二十四日，本报记者随同张家口市长孙敬文，察哈尔省总工会主任孙铭，及该矿经理马叔乾等前往祝察，见该地数约三千余栋之房舍全遭拆毁，七万七千伏特之高压线已大半被截断盗走，变电所已全毁，散布于各坑间数以百计之巨型电动机（多为五十至一百五十或二百马力者，最大者有五百马力者）多已成废铁。据守卫该矿场之戈振民同志谈称：平津少数不法商人经常到矿区收买铜铁，宣化市人民政府工商科亦允许一公营合作社派人至矿区附近收购，这样就无形中引起了少数坏分子的破坏活动。为此察哈尔省人民政府曾数次命令当地之宣化、龙关等县政府设法制止破坏，但至今仍未见有任何成效。我们希望当地政府应纠正对于人民财产的不关心态度，迅速发动群众，教育不法分子，订出有效办法，停止破坏。并望人民政府下令禁止商人在矿区收购铜铁。按：庞家堡采矿所在日寇侵据时期，为龙烟铁矿主要采矿场，矿场电气设备，至为宏大。日产曾高达六千余吨，该地铁砂储藏量据日人“北支开发会社”调查为一亿九千三百万吨。
