Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 30th: TASS Rome dispatch: The strike of over one million construction workers in Italy, after sixteen days of tenacious struggle, victoriously concluded on the 28th. Due to the strikers' unity and the support of workers in other industrial sectors of Italy, the employers' resistance was finally overcome. The employers were forced to agree to resume negotiations on revising the wage system for construction workers and other items in the past labor contracts, and were forced to agree to pay workers a portion of their wages for the strike period.

    【新华社北平三十日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利一百余万建筑业工人的大罢工，经十六天顽强斗争后已于二十八日胜利结束。由于罢工者的团结一致及意大利其他工业部门工人的声援，雇主的抵抗终被压倒。雇主被迫同意恢复关于修改建筑业工人发放工资制度和过去劳动合同上其他项目的谈判，并被迫同意付给工人罢工期间一部分工资。
