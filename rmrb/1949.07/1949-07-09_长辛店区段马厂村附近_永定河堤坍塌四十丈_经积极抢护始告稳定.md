　　Forty *Zhang* of Yongding River Embankment Collapses; Stabilized After Active Emergency Repairs

　　[This newspaper reports] On June 29th, heavy rain caused the Yongding River to rise, resulting in the collapse of over forty *zhang* of the embankment on the right bank near Duǎn Mǎchǎng Village in Chángxīndiàn District. Cadres from the district flood control headquarters, along with river soldiers and local villagers, immediately added willow fascines (*xiāng guà liǔ*) and actively worked to repair the damage. The Beijing Municipal Government Construction Bureau also dispatched technical personnel who arrived at 12:00 AM to participate in the protection efforts, thereby stabilizing the embankment. The next day, the North China Water Conservancy Commission also sent personnel to survey the engineering and water conditions. On July 2nd, Director Xing of the North China Water Conservancy Commission, along with consultant Sun Runfu, Deputy Section Chief Yang of the Design Section, and Director Ding of the Jìzhōng Water Conservancy Bureau, conducted a detailed inspection of the river embankment along the Chángxīndiàn District. The willow fascine (*xiāng sào*) works in this section were generally found to be sturdy and up to standard. However, in some individual sections, cracks were found in the back of the *sào*, leaks in the top of the *sào*, failure of optical cables and *xíng jué* pilings, low and incomplete embankments, the failure of original seepage dams (*tòushuǐ bà*) and abandoned ponds, and some flood workers going to the levee without tools, especially the widespread absence of wooden tampers. In response to these issues, the Water Conservancy Commission has instructed for corrections to be made and has specifically pointed out several projects that should be repaired: in addition to repairing incomplete sections, this includes repairing three seepage dams, adding two seepage dams, and reinforcing the riverbank with counterberms and other projects. Frequent heavy rains have occurred since late June, and it is generally estimated that this year's flood season may begin earlier.

　　长辛店区段马厂村附近
  　永定河堤坍塌四十丈  经积极抢护始告稳定
    【本报讯】六月二十九日，大雨倾盆，永定河曾一度涨水，长辛店区段右岸马厂村附近堤岸坍塌四十余丈。当经该区段防汛指挥部干部率同河兵及附近村庄群众加厢挂柳，积极抢护，北平市政府建设局亦派技术人员于夜十二时赶到参加防护，堤坝得以稳定。次日，华北水利委员会亦派员前往勘查工程及水情。七月二日华北水利委员会邢主任又偕同顾问孙润甫、设计科杨副科长、冀中水利局丁局长等到长辛店区河段沿堤详细检查。该段今年厢埽工程，一般尚坚实合格；唯个别地段发现埽背裂缝、埽顶漏孔、光缆及行橛失效、堤岸卑矮残缺，原有透水坝废池失效，上堤汛工有未带工具者，特别是木夯普遍未带等现象。针对以上情况，水利委员会已指示纠正，并具体指出若干应加修的工程：除补修残缺外，计修补透水坝三处，加修透水坝两个及护岸打水埝等工程。六月下旬以来暴雨频仍，一般估计今年汛期可能提前。
