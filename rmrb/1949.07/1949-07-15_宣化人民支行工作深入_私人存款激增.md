　　Xuanhua People's Branch Bank Deepens Work
  　Private Savings Surge
    [Xuanhua News] The People's Bank of Xuanhua Branch has made preliminary achievements in attracting private savings. In April, the bank had only four private savings accounts, with a total of 106,000 yuan. By mid-June, this had increased to 300 accounts, with a total of 3,000,000 yuan. This rapid development is mainly due to the cadres actively delving into their work, using every opportunity to promote the bank, making business people and the public understand that the People's Bank is different from the Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalist banks; and actively contacting businesses to establish working relationships. The bank's work itself has also changed from a bureaucratic style to simplifying deposit procedures and revising business hours from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM to 6:00 AM to 7:00 PM. It is also stipulated that someone be on duty during non-business hours and holidays, providing depositors with maximum convenience. Cadres have changed from being indifferent to customers in the past to sincerely and diligently handling business. Due to the above reasons, the bank has achieved better results in attracting private savings than other small cities. This has broken the mistaken notion that "private savings are difficult to attract."

　　宣化人民支行工作深入
  　私人存款激增
    【宣化讯】人民银行宣化支行在吸收私人存款工作上，已作出初步成绩。该行在四月份，私人存款仅四户，存款额一○六、○○○元，至六月中旬，已增至三百户，存款额达三、○○○、○○○元。开展如此迅速，主要是由于干部积极深入工作，利用一切机会进行宣传，使商民了解人民银行与国民党官僚资本家的银行不同；主动和商户联系，建立往来关系。银行工作本身，也改变了机关化作风，简化存款手续，改订营业时间，由上午九时至十二时，下午一时至四时改为上午六时至下午七时。营业时间以外及假日，也规定有人值班办公。给存户以最大便利。干部由过去对顾客冷淡变为诚恳、殷勤的接洽业务。由于以上原因，使该行吸收私人存款工作上，成绩较其他小城市为佳。这样就打破了认为“私人存款难吸收”的错误看法。
