　　Tianjin Jiaotong Bank Supports Industrial Production
　　Real Value Loans, Real Value Recovery
　　Preventing speculation, guaranteeing profits, and achieving mutual benefit for both public and private sectors is a new development in loan work.
　　[Special dispatch from our newspaper] Tianjin Jiaotong Bank has achieved significant results and important experience in helping private industrial enterprises beneficial to the people's livelihood through unfavorable production seasons by focusing on ordering and real value loans, combined with a pilot "lend-in-kind (semi-finished products), recover-in-kind" method. Tianjin Jiaotong Bank conducted this planned industrial support. In June, a total of 237,200,000 yuan in loans were issued (excluding overdrafts). Key industries included chemical, flour, paper, steel, and rubber, while others such as dyeing and weaving, oil pressing, leather making, and shipping were also able to maintain normal production due to the bank's loan support. For example, the main product of the chemical industry, vulcanized black, experiences low demand in the summer, with peak sales historically occurring around the Mid-Autumn Festival in August. Soda sulfide is mainly sold in Shanghai, but although Shanghai had been liberated, trade between the North and South was not yet smooth, and transportation was difficult, making it difficult to sell finished products. The Shenquanji Chemical Factory was in a state of semi-shutdown due to poor sales, insufficient raw materials, and damage to its large furnace. In June, it requested loans from Jiaotong Bank three times, totaling 35,000,000 yuan, which was used to repair the damaged furnace and obtain sufficient raw materials, thereby returning to normal production. According to factory director Dong, the entire factory staff was in high spirits after resuming production. The average daily output of soda sulfide in June was 140 barrels, exceeding the pre-liberation daily output by 40%. Mr. Wang of the factory also said, "If it weren't for the bank's help, our factory would have had no way to survive in June. We had no sales channels and lacked funds, and we didn't dare to borrow from private banks" (due to high interest rates and short terms). He was very satisfied with Jiaotong Bank's real value loan method, believing that "although the price negotiated during the real value loan was lower than the later selling price of the finished product, the price of raw materials purchased at the time of the loan was also low, so neither the public nor private sectors suffered losses." By the end of June, transportation between Shanghai and Tianjin had gradually recovered, and sales of soda sulfide had greatly improved. In a very short time, 2,109 barrels of soda sulfide were sold. Regarding assistance to the flour industry, the trade company assisted various flour mills in jointly organizing a unified purchasing and sales committee. Due to insufficient funds after raising 60 million yuan, Jiaotong Bank provided a loan of 40 million yuan to purchase wheat in the Xuzhou area. According to the committee, the purchased wheat can supply the mills under its jurisdiction for two rotations. Furthermore, much of the paper produced in Tianjin is low-grade and does not meet social needs, and many facilities are not suitable for improvement. Currently, during the off-season, Jiaotong Bank's support for the paper industry is mainly focused on helping them improve quality and product development. Among them, the privately-owned Changjiang Paper Mill's newsprint machine was damaged by artillery fire, and the bank strongly supported it with loans, providing 14.25 million yuan in order-based loans. Most of the machine and building repairs have been completed and production will soon resume. Factory manager Wang said that without Jiaotong Bank's serious support, Changjiang Paper Mill would not have its current appearance. Other paper mills, such as Xinghua, Bohai, and Xingxing, have also successively obtained loans to add machine parts, purchase raw materials, and improve production. At the same time, Jiaotong Bank, focusing on the dyeing and weaving industry, began to pilot the "lend-in-kind, recover-in-kind" loan method, which involves first providing loans to the spinning industry to order goods and recover the pre-ordered yarn (semi-finished products). The yarn is then loaned to the dyeing and weaving industry to produce cloth or flour sacks. For example, the 18 silk weaving machines of the Huaxin Weaving and Dyeing Company had been shut down for some time due to a shortage of raw materials and products that did not meet current needs. In June, after borrowing 10 bales of yarn from Jiaotong Bank, they gradually repaired their machines and switched to weaving flour sacks. Nine machines are now in formal production, producing 500 sacks per day, while the remaining nine machines are being repaired while also in production. Once fully installed, they will be able to produce 1,000 sacks per day. This has allowed the 18 textile machines that had been shut down for a long time to rejoin the production line. Xinfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory also obtained two pieces of Baxian yarn in the same way. Facts have proven that this "lend-in-kind, recover-in-kind" (physical goods) chain-like loan method is a further development of the real value ordering loan method, and a better way to support industrial production, balance public and private interests, and achieve mutual benefit for both public and private sectors. Based on this short-term experience and feedback from various factories, it has the following advantages: (1) The bank must recover the semi-finished products (or finished products) from the next production process after lending in kind. After obtaining the loan, the factory must produce finished products before returning the specified goods (finished products or semi-finished products). This is a good way to ensure production and prevent speculation. (2) The factory directly obtains production raw materials, reducing the trouble of having to buy raw materials with cash, saving time and miscellaneous expenses in the purchasing process, thereby reducing costs and increasing profits. It also avoids losses due to rising prices if raw materials cannot be purchased in time after obtaining the loan. (3) Guarantees a certain profit for the factory: For example, each piece of yarn can weave 2,500 to 2,600 flour sacks. If the bank lends out one piece of yarn and stipulates the recovery of a certain quantity of finished products, the factory's profit is guaranteed after deducting various expenses. Based on a loan period of 20 days to one month, and continuing to circulate two or three times, the net profit can be appropriately increased. (4) From the bank's perspective, it also reduces the business of recovering physical goods and then selling them. The two sales at least needed can be reduced to one, and the physical principal can be guaranteed; in addition, a one or two percent interest in kind is charged, which is very beneficial to the bank's expansion of support for production. From the above analysis, lending and recovering in kind is indeed a loan method that conforms to the principles of developing production and mutual benefit for both public and private sectors. In the future, this business should be developed in a more planned and comprehensive way. For example, soda sulfide can be lent to those who make vulcanized black, wire rods can be lent to those who draw wire and make nails, pig iron can be lent to the machinery industry, needle material can be lent to those who make needles, and flour sacks can be lent to the flour industry, etc. After such a chain is widely developed, the supporting role for Tianjin's industrial production will be greatly enhanced.

　　津交行扶植工业生产
  　折实贷款，折实收实
    防止投机，保证利润，作到公私两利，是贷款工作新发展。
    【本报专讯】天津市交通银行以定货、折实贷款为主结合试办连环性的贷实（半成品）收实方法扶助有益国民生计的私营工业渡过生产中的不利季节，曾获得显著成效与重要经验。津交通银行此次有计划地进行扶植工业。六月份共发放贷款二三七、二○○、○○○元（透支不在内）。其中以化学工业、面粉、造纸、钢铁、橡胶业为重点，其他如染织、榨油、制革、航业也都因得到该行贷款扶助而能够正常进行生产。例如化学工业中的主要产品硫化青，时值夏季，农村需要量小，历年是八月节才是畅销季节，硫化碱主要销于上海，上海虽已解放，但当时南北贸易尚未沟通，运输困难，成品仍不易销售。慎泉记化学厂就因销路困难，原料不足，大炉损坏，呈半停工状态，六月份中三次向交通银行请求贷款三五、○○○、○○○余万，以该项贷款修复了损坏的大炉并获得了充足的原料；从而步入了正常生产。据董厂长谈，全厂职工于恢复生产后情绪很高，六月份平均日产硫化碱一四○桶，较解放前日产量超过百分之四十。该厂王先生亦说：“咱们厂里若无银行帮助，六月份就没有办法，既无销路，又缺资金，亦不敢向私银号贷款”（因银号利息大期限短）。对于交通银行的折实贷款办法甚为满意，认为“折实贷款时所议的价格虽较以后出卖成品价格低，但当时贷到款买到原料价亦低，这样公私都不吃亏”。至六月末上海天津交通逐渐恢复，硫化碱销路已大见好转。很短时间即销出硫化碱二一○九桶。对于面粉业的帮助，贸易公司曾协助各面粉厂共同组织了统一购销委员会，因集资六千万尚感资金不足，由交通银行贷予四千万元到徐州一带收购小麦。据该委员会谈此次购到的小麦，可供所属各厂周转两次。再如天津市的纸业所产产品多为低级纸，不合社会需要，许多设备不合改进条件；当前又逢背月，故交通银行对纸业的扶植精神主要是帮助其提高质量，改进产品。其中私营长江造纸厂因被炮火损坏了报纸机，银行则以大力贷款支持，先后作订货贷款一四二五万元，现机器房屋大部修竣，很快即可恢复生产，该厂王经理说，若非交通银行认真扶助，长江纸厂绝不会有今天的面貌。其他如兴华、渤海、星星等纸厂亦先后贷款添配机件，购买原料，改进生产。与此同时交通银行又以染织业为重点，开始试办贷实收实的贷款方法，就是第一步以贷款定货扶助纺纱业，收回预定的纱（半成品）。第二步又把纱贷给染织业制成布或面袋；例如华新织染公司的十八台丝织机，早因原料缺乏及产品不适合目前需要而停工，六月份向交通银行贷到纱十包即逐渐修装机器，改织面袋，现在已有九台正式生产，日产面袋五○○条，其余九台亦正在一面生产一面修整，俟全面装好即可日产面袋一千条。这样就使停工已久的十八台纺织机重新参加了生产行列。新丰染织厂亦以同样方式贷到八仙纱两件。事实证明这种贷实、收实（实物）连环性的贷款方式是折实订货贷款方式的进一步发展，是扶植工业生产，公私兼顾，公私两利的较好办法根据这一短时期的体验与各厂反映有以下几个优点：（一）银行贷实要收回再一步生产过程中的半成品（或成品），厂方贷到实后，必须生产成品才能交回规定的货物（成品或半成品），这是保证生产防止投机的好办法。（二）厂方直接得到了生产原料减少再以现款去买原料的麻烦，可以节省时间节省购买过程中的杂费开支；因而也就减低了成本，提高了利润；另方面也避免了贷到款后不能及时买到原料而遭到物价上涨的损失。（三）保证了厂方的一定利润：如每件纱可织面袋二五○○条至二六○○条，银行若贷出一件纱规定收回一定数量成品，除去各项开支厂方的利润是确定的。按贷款期退二十天至一个月，继续周转两三次，纯利更可适当提高。（四）从银行方面说也减少了贷款收回实物再出售的业务。至少需要两次出售的可以减为一次，并能保证实物本；另外收取一二分实物息，这样对银行扩大扶助生产上也很有利。从上述几方面分析，贷实、收实确是符合发展生产、公私两利原则的贷款方法。今后应当更加有计划的多方开展此项业务，如硫化碱可贷给制硫化青的。盘条可贷给拔丝、制钉的，元铁可贷给机器业，针料可贷给制针的，面袋又可贷给面粉业等等。这样连环起来广泛开展之后，对于天津工业生产的扶助作用，将会大大增强。
