Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 11th: London dispatch: Campbell, editor of the British Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, convened a meeting at the Daily Worker office on July 6th, inviting Alan Winnington, a reporter who had returned to Britain from China, to report on the situation in China. The venue was decorated with a huge map of China indicating the liberated areas, flanked by large portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. Chairman Mao Zedong's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" was sold in the hall and quickly sold out. Campbell said at the meeting: "We must demand that the British government not miss the opportunity to establish equal and mutually beneficial relations with New China." Campbell said that Bevin should not try to use back-door diplomacy to obtain recognition of British consuls in the liberated areas of China without recognizing the People's Government. He should understand that dealing with New China is no longer dealing with people like the Kuomintang, but with mature political leaders who will not allow China's sovereignty to be infringed upon in any way. Then, Alan Winnington, a witness to recent events in the liberated areas of China, amid the applause of hundreds of listeners welcoming his speech, gave a vivid description of the great march of the People's Liberation Army under General Lin Biao from Manchuria to liberate Beiping, as well as the amazing discipline of the people's soldiers. What particularly interested the London workers was the description of the new situation of Chinese workers and the leading role they played in the New Democratic system. Winnington also talked about women and land reform. The audience was very interested in the situation in China. When Winnington looked at the clock to see if it was time, people shouted, "Keep talking! Keep talking!"

  　魏宁敦报告新中国情况
    甘贝尔要英政府不放过机会
  　同新中国建立平等互利关系
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】伦敦航讯：英国共产党机关报工人日报编辑甘贝尔于七月六日在工人日报馆召集一个集会，邀请由中国返英的记者阿兰·魏宁敦报告关于中国的情况。会场装饰有指明已解放地区的巨幅中国地图，两侧有毛泽东主席及朱德总司令的大幅肖像。毛泽东主席的“论人民民主专政”在大厅中出售，很快就销售一空。甘贝尔在会上说：“我们必须要求英国政府不要放过与新中国建立平等互利关系的机会。”甘贝尔说：贝文不应试图使用后门外交来取得对中国解放区英国领事的承认，而不承认人民政府。他应当了解他与新中国打交道，已不再是与国民党这样的人打交道，而是与不会让中国主权遭到任何侵害的成熟的政治领袖打交道。接着，阿兰·魏宁敦，一位中国解放区最近事件的目击者，在数百听众欢迎他的讲话的掌声中，对中国人民解放军林彪将军所部由满洲出发前往解放北平的大进军，以及人民战士的惊人的纪律，都作了生动的描述。伦敦工人特别感兴趣的，是关于中国工人的新境况，和他们在新民主主义制度中所起领导作用的描写。魏宁敦并谈到妇女和土地改革问题。听众对中国情况感到很大的兴趣。当魏宁敦注视着时钟，看时间是否到了时，人们就喊着：“说下去！说下去！”
