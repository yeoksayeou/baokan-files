　　With National Bank Loans Supporting Them
  　Zhangjiakou's Public and Private Industry and Commerce
  　Are Generally Recovering and Developing
    [Zhangjiakou News] Zhangjiakou's industry and commerce, which had been on the verge of complete collapse under the Kuomintang rule, have been developing since liberation under the people's government's policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital. The bank has been providing loan support. According to statistics, as of June 20, the total amount of loans was 273.17 million yuan. Among them, industrial loans accounted for 77 percent, commerce accounted for 22 percent, and cooperatives accounted for 1 percent. State-owned enterprises accounted for 91 percent, and private enterprises accounted for 9 percent. In February, there were 662 industrial and commercial households, and by June, there were 935, an increase of 273. Loans have played a certain role in this. The development of each industry is as follows:
    Mongolian Trade: After support, it has recovered from 3 households to 28 households, and has driven the increased production and activities of other industries and transportation and sales industries. For example:
    (1) The Mongolian boot industry has increased from 14 households to 19 households. The output has increased from 102 pairs per month to 390 pairs. (2) The leather industry has increased from 42 households to 51 households, and the number of workers has increased from 60 to 72. The output in March was 248 pieces, and the output in May reached 339 pieces.
    Flour Industry: It has increased from 123 households to 177 households (including 87 electric mills and 90 manual mills), and the number of workers has increased from 422 to 490. The output has increased from 1.2 million jin per month to 2.64 million jin. The production has more than doubled.
    Iron Industry: (1) The Ping-Sui Railway Cooperative Iron Factory has added several electric rolling machines and lathes, and the number of workers has increased from 15 to more than 40. The output of products such as rail spikes, screws, and iron pots has increased by more than one time compared to before. (2) The seven foundry businesses that had closed down before liberation have all resumed work. After the loan, 60 tons of coke were purchased and transported from Tangshan. Now the number of workers has increased from 40 to more than 80. The monthly output of iron pots, etc., has reached 42 tons.
    Kiln Industry: The Kuiji Kiln Factory, which was shut down before liberation, has resumed production after the loan solved the fuel problem. The number of workers has increased from 18 to 24. The output has increased from 80,000 bricks to 120,000 bricks.
    Soap Industry: The Desert Soap Factory, which had been shut down for several years, has been rebuilt and resumed production. It now has 36 workers. It produces 27 boxes of soap and more than 30 jin of glycerin per day.
    The various factories under the State-owned Trading Company initially recovered production slowly due to limited funds. After a large amount of loans, the situation has greatly improved. (1) Flour Mill: There are a total of three factories. The output in April was 110,000 jin, and the output in May was more than 170,000 jin. And it stores about 100,000 jin of raw materials. (2) Oil Pressing Plant: The output in May reached 95,000 jin, 700,000 jin of raw materials were purchased and prepared, and 130,000 jin of finished products were stored. (3) Material Factory: It produces more than 18,000 bottles per month. The alcohol factory produces more than 20,000 jin per month. The soy sauce factory produces 30,000 jin per month. Other factories such as the material factory, glue factory, and Xuanhua Paper Mill have also increased production. The cigarette factory has stocked up on enough raw materials. It will be able to start work in a short period of time.

　　在国家银行贷款扶植下
  　张垣公私工商业
  　均普遍恢复发展
    【张垣讯】在国民党统治时期已将完全垮台的张市工商业，解放后在人民政府发展生产劳资两利的政策下，银行配合进行了贷款扶植，据统计截至六月二十日止，贷款总额共两亿七千三百一十七万元。其中工业贷款占百分之七七，商业占百分二十二，合作社占百分之一。而公营占百分之九一，私营占百分之九。工商业二月份原有六六二户，六月已达九三五户，增加了二七三户。贷款在其中是起了一定作用的。各行业发展的情况如下：
    旅蒙业：经扶植后，由三户恢复到二八户，并带动了其他工业、运销业的增产及活动。如：
    （一）蒙靴业由一四户增加到一九户。产量由月产一○二双增到三九○双。（二）制革业由四二户增加到五一户，工人由六○人增加到七二人，三月份生产量二四八张，五月份生产达三三九张。
    面粉业：由一二三户增加到一七七户（内电磨八七户，旱磨九○户），工人由四二二人增到四九○人。产量由月产一二○万斤增至二六四万斤。增产达一倍以上。
    铁工业：（一）平绥路合作社铁工厂，添置了电滚机器车床数部，工人由十五人增至四十余人。道钉、螺丝、铁锅等产品，已较前提高一倍。（二）解放前已经歇业的七户铸造业均已复工。贷款后由唐山购运焦炭六十吨。现工人已由四十人增至八十余人。铁锅等月产达四二吨。
    窑业：解放前停工的魁记窑厂，经贷款后解决了燃料困难恢复了生产。工人由一八人增至二四人。产量由八万砖增至十二万砖。
    肥皂业：停工数年的沙漠肥皂厂，恢复重建起来，现有工人三六人。日产肥皂二七箱、甘油三○余斤。
    国营贸易公司所属各厂，初因资金所限，生产恢复较缓，大量贷款后，局面已大为开展。（一）面粉厂：共三个厂，四月份产量十一万斤，五月份十七万余斤。并储存约十万斤原料。（二）榨油厂：五月份产量达九万五千斤，购备原料七十万斤，储存成品十三万斤。（三）料品厂：每月产瓶一万八千余个。酒精厂月产两万余斤。酱油厂月产三万斤。其他如材料厂、胶厂及宣化造纸厂均已提高生产。纸烟厂已备足原料。短期内即可开工。
