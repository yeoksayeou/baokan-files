　　The People Remoulded Me
    Yang Shuo
    Combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers – it can be difficult or easy, depending on one's own determination. These people's masses who create the world are not ethereal gods, unreachable; on the contrary, they are very easy to approach. But as an intellectual like myself, after all these years of beating around the bush, I am still only half a bottle of vinegar, not full and sloshing around. In the final analysis, it is my own fault.
    During the early years of the Anti-Japanese War, I wandered around in the enemy's rear in North China for several years, spending a long time in the countryside and in the army. On the surface, I mixed with soldiers and peasants, seemingly "going deep among the masses," but in my heart, I was like a drop of oil in the ocean of the people, always floating on the surface, oily and a little dazzling. At that time, a comrade joked with me, saying, "How is it that you roll around and still maintain the airs of a gentleman?"
    Was it my appearance that affected my ability to approach the masses? Partly, but not entirely. The real key lay in my thinking. Though I didn't say it, I was somewhat arrogant in my heart, consciously or unconsciously exaggerating the function of literature and art, believing it to be the work of a noble realm of thought, extraordinary. Engaging in literature and art myself, I naturally considered myself extraordinary as well. So, my words and actions outwardly carried a sense of superiority, unconsciously. If the masses look at you with awe, how can you approach them?
    But it was precisely those years behind enemy lines that taught me a lesson. Who was charging forward on the front lines, risking their lives to defend the suffering motherland? The peasants in military uniforms! Who was working hard in the rear to produce for the front? Still the peasants! What did I do? I couldn't lift or carry anything. In battle, I became a burden, needing others to take care of me. Waving a pen to write something, compared to the great struggle of the people creating history, was so insignificant that it couldn't even be seen with the naked eye. What was there to boast about? Yet the people treated you with such warmth. I will always remember a dark night in the summer of 1940, with thunderstorms raging, when I followed a small team across a river blockaded by the enemy. The searchlights from the surrounding watchtowers flashed back and forth, and the enemy situation was very serious. The soldiers took my hand and led me across a makeshift wooden bridge. When the machine guns in the watchtower fired, they quickly scooped me up onto a horse and several soldiers protected me, rushing me out first. Most of them stayed behind, covering me until I was far away, and then they caught up. This kind of comradeship, risking their own lives for you without any regard for their own safety, would move even the hardest heart.
    I recognized the greatness of the people and wanted to serve them. I talked to them and wrote about their deeds. But I spoke and wrote as an outsider. I was not one of them, I didn't understand their thoughts and feelings, let alone appreciate their joys and sorrows. I wrote some things haphazardly, which was ridiculous. Most of it was conceptual, lacking in life and emotion. I insulted the people I respected with my pen.
    After the Japanese surrendered, I went to the Longyan Iron Mine in Xuanhua, Chahar. For the first time, I truly approached the people. I went there to work and to train myself and remould myself. I recognized my problems in my thinking and resolved to "put down the stinky airs and humbly become a primary school student." My demeanor was still so "bookish," but when my thinking changed, my attitude changed. Strangely enough, the workers didn't dislike me, and some even became good friends with me. I helped with some work in the mine and often went to the work site where they were mining. At night, I went to their big workshops or family houses to talk and chat, sometimes drinking a few cups together, without any sense of formality. They knew I was a writer, and sometimes jokingly called me a "scribe," which was even better. They then systematically helped me understand the situation of the mine during the Japanese occupation. They talked about the suffering they had endured in the past. As I listened, I felt as if I had suffered the same way and felt the pain too. In the past, I seemed to be separated from them by a layer of skin. Why was I now able to be infected by their emotions? It's actually quite ordinary. My life and work had begun to connect with them, and I felt that they were like my own relatives. If you hear about the experiences of your own relatives, wouldn't you be moved? They opened their hearts and let me go to the deepest depths. But, carefully examining myself, I couldn't be as naked as they were. I even harboured a kind of purposefulness that was not easily noticeable to myself, wanting to get something from them in order to write a work. This was sinful. I realized that I had not yet forgotten myself and that the remoulding was not thorough enough.
    Later, I started writing the novel "Hongshishan" (Red Stone Mountain) at the mine. I had initially come into contact with life, become familiar with the characters, and been infected by their thoughts and feelings. As soon as I picked up a pen, many images jumped around in my mind, naturally jumping together. The most difficult thing was the language. I could understand every word of the workers. I was overwhelmed by their richly colorful language, but I couldn't speak like that. Even if I tried to imitate them, I would stutter and stammer, and it would come out wrong. Sometimes I would listen to them speaking and try to remember it in my heart, but in the blink of an eye, I would forget and couldn't say it. Because language comes from life, and rich life produces rich language. How could I easily achieve that all at once? Some workers were particularly enthusiastic in helping me organize the story, assigning characters, and even correcting my language. After nine months, I managed to complete the first draft of this novel, and this novel was the most accurate assessment of my work during this period. Because my combination with the workers was not thorough enough, there were such shortcomings in the novel: (1) The characters did not achieve typicality, only general individuality; (2) In terms of language, some worker comrades felt that it was not popular enough.
    During the Liberation War in these years, I was mostly in the army. Some comrades, seeing me, laughed and said, "Why are you still so refined?" But as long as you can arouse a common reflection with the people on common things, then the approach of thoughts and feelings comes first, and the style is a secondary issue. Now I am writing a military novel, and new worries are entangling me again. When writing Red Stone Mountain, I wrote it among the workers, and I always received their support and help. But now, the army is far away from me, and when I pick up the pen, I feel that this confidence is insufficient. Strength comes from the masses. Away from the masses, how small and lonely I am! The people have remoulded me (although the remoulding is still far from enough). I know that I can never leave them.

　　人民改造了我
    杨朔
    与工农兵结合这事，说难也难，说容易也容易，基本的关键在于自个的决心。这些创造世界的人民大众并不是虚无缥缈的神仙，高不可攀，倒是顶容易接近的。可是作为一个知识分子的我，这些年转弯抹角的，直到现在还是个半瓶子醋，一瓶子不满半瓶子晃荡，归根到底还是自己的毛病。
    抗日战争初期，我在华北敌人后方乱串了几年，长年在农村里，在部队里，表面上跟战士农民混在一起，好象“深入群众”了，骨子里却象一滴油滴到人民的大海里，总漂在浮面上，油光光的有点刺眼。当时有位同志开我的玩笑说：“你怎么滚来滚去，还是个绅士派头？”
    是不是我的外貌影响了我接近群众？有一点，但不全是。真正的要害却在于我的思想。我嘴里不说，心里多少有点自大，有意无意地夸大了文艺的功能，以为这是属于高贵的思想领域的工作，不同凡响。自己搞文艺，自然也就不同凡响了。于是表现在外面的言语举动不自觉地带着一种优越感。群众对你望而生畏，你怎能接近他们呢？
    但也正是敌后那几年，事实教训了我。是谁在火线上冲锋陷阵，拿性命来保卫灾难的祖国？穿了军装的农民！是谁在后方一把汗一把力地生产支前？还是农民！我做了些什么呢？手不能提，肩不能挑，打起仗来，倒变成个累赘，要人家来照顾我。摇摇笔杆子写点东西，比起人民创造历史的伟大斗争，渺小得连肉眼都看不见，有什么值得夸耀的？而人民对你却又那么热情。我永远记得一九四○年夏天一个雷雨交加的黑夜，我跟着一支小队伍过一条敌人封锁的河流，四外岗楼的探照灯闪来闪去，敌情很严重。战士们搀着我的手，领我走过临时搭成的木桥。岗楼的机枪一响，赶紧把我撮上马，由几个战士保护着我先突出去，他们大部分人却留在后边，掩护着我走远了，然后才赶上来。这种同志之间的友爱，为了你，毫不计较自己的生死安全，铁石心肠的人也要受到感动。
    我认识了人民的伟大，要替他们服务。找他们谈，写他们的事迹。但我却作为一个旁观者来谈来写。我不是他们当中的一个，不了解他们的思想感情，更无从体味到他们的欢乐和痛苦。我胡乱写了些东西，可笑啊，大半是概念的，缺乏生活，没有感情，我在笔下侮辱了我所尊敬的人民。
    日寇投降后，我到了察哈尔宣化的龙烟铁矿去。第一次真正接近了人民。我去，是为了工作，也为了锻炼自己，改造自己。我从思想上认识了自己的毛病，决心要“放下臭架子，甘当小学生”。我的作风还是那么“文绉绉”的，但是思想一变，态度变了，说来也怪，工人们居然不嫌弃我，有些跟我都变成好朋友。我在矿山上帮着做点事，常到他们采矿的活地去，黑夜到他们大工房或是家族房子去，谈天说地，有时一块喝上几盅，彼此毫不见外。他们知道我是写东西的，有时开玩笑叫我是师爷，这倒更好，他们就有计划地帮助我了解日寇统治时期矿山的情形。他们谈自己过去所受的痛苦，我听着听着，仿佛自己亲身遭受的一样，也感到痛苦。过去我跟他们老象隔着一层皮，现在为什么能够感染到他们的感情呢？说起来也平常。我的生活、工作，已经开始跟他们连结一起，觉得他们象自己的亲人一样。你听到自己亲人的遭际，你会不动心么？他们把心打开了，让我进到最深的底层去，但我，细细地检查自己一下，却又不能象他们那样赤裸裸的，竟怀着一种自己也不易觉察的目的性，想从他们身上得到点什么东西，好写作品。这是有罪的，我明白我还未能忘了自己改造的还不到家。
    后来，我在矿山上动笔写“红石山”这部小说。我初步地接触了生活，熟习了人物，感染到他们的思想感情，一拿起笔，许多形象就在我眼前乱跳，自然而然跳到一起。最困难的倒是语言。我能听懂工人的每一句话，我为他们的富有形象色彩的语言所绝倒，但我不会那样说，叫我照样学说一遍，也会结结巴巴的，说走了样。有时一边听他们说话，一边心里记，一转眼可又忘了，说不出了。因为语言是从生活里来的，丰富的生活产生了丰富的语言，我一下子如何容易办得到？有些工人特别热情地帮助我组织故事，配备人物，甚而纠正我的语言。前后九个月，我好歹完成了这部小说的初稿，而这部小说正是我这一段工作的最准确的鉴定。由于我与工人的结合还不到家，小说里就存在了这样的缺点：（一）人物达不到典型性，只是一般的个性；（二）在语言上，有的工人同志看了，觉得还不够通俗。
    这几年解放战争中，我大半在部队里。有的同志见了我笑道：“你怎么还是这样斯文？”但是只要你能在共同的事物上，与人民激起共同的反映，这就是思想感情先接近了，作风倒是其次的问题。现在我正动笔写一部军事小说，新的苦恼又缠绕了我。写红石山时，就在工人当中写，随时都得到他们的支持，他们的帮助。而现时，部队离我远远的，拿起笔来，我竟觉得这样的信心不足。力量是从群众当中来的，离开群众，我是多么渺小，多么的孤单呀！人民改造了我（虽然改造的还很不够），我知道我是永远离不开他们了。
