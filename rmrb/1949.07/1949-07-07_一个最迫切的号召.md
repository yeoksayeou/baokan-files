　　A Most Urgent Call
    Shao Lizi
    "Swiftly conclude a peace treaty with Japan in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement" is the most urgent of the great calls issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the twelfth anniversary of the Anti-Japanese War. This call is a matter of course; because the Potsdam Agreement not only presented Japan with the most firm and clear conditions, but also the most sacred constraint between the Allied countries. If this is not done, it would be to easily abandon international credibility, and the issue of the peace treaty with Japan would inevitably be impossible to resolve forever, which would not only endanger peace in East Asia, but even world peace. At the same time, this is perfectly fair; China is the country that suffered the most from Japanese imperialism and sacrificed the most in the Anti-Japanese War. It is most fair and reasonable for China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom to negotiate and resolve the issue of the peace treaty with Japan in accordance with the principles of the Potsdam Agreement in order to prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism. Therefore, we must today unanimously and resolutely support this call, and unanimously strive to ensure that the peace treaty with Japan can be concluded swiftly and in accordance with the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, so that Japan does not become a base exclusively occupied by American imperialism, endangering the peace of our country and East Asia, and even the whole world.
    I would now like to say a little more about the heartache and indignation that this issue can arouse today. As early as three and a half years ago, in January of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), the Political Consultative Conference held in Chongqing passed a program for peaceful national construction. It was unanimously passed by all parties participating in the conference with harmonious and enthusiastic emotions. Item 5 on Diplomacy, Article 2 on the Japan issue, of the Program for Peaceful National Construction read as follows:
    "In accordance with the Potsdam Declaration, eliminate the remaining forces of Japan in China, and jointly seek solutions to the Japan issue with the Allied countries, prevent the resurgence of Japanese fascist militarist forces, and ensure the security of East Asia."
    How clear this provision is. If the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference had not been torn up by the reactionaries, but had been implemented in good faith, so that China could embark on the road of independence, freedom, democracy, and unity through genuine national peace and unity, I think the Japan issue could have been jointly resolved by our country and the Allied countries long ago, and the peace treaty with Japan would have been concluded long ago. How could we have relied on American aid for the civil war, even relying on the whims of American imperialism on the Japan issue, so that the bloodshed and sacrifices of our eight-year war of resistance could not yield the slightest benefit, and we still need to discuss this issue of the peace treaty with Japan today? Thinking back on this period of history today, we feel very heartbroken, and we cannot help but feel very indignant towards the reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek.
    These reactionaries have recently been making dying struggles, and are even more perverse and resorting to any means. The harm they inflict on the people is even more brutal than that of the Japanese fascist militarists. I cannot imagine what kind of shameless slander they will utter against this call to "swiftly conclude a peace treaty with Japan in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement," because at the recent meeting of the four foreign ministers in Paris, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky proposed to convene a foreign ministers' meeting with China participating on a regular basis, in accordance with the Potsdam principles, to prepare for the peace treaty with Japan, but this proposal was rejected by the British and American foreign ministers. The reactionaries themselves want to be the echo of the United States and Britain, and they must turn around and slander those who uphold justice, and must cite the veto power issue that the United States and Britain often talk about, hoping to confuse those who do not understand the truth. They have abandoned the principles they once agreed to, just as they tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Precisely because the reactionaries still need to be thoroughly eliminated, we must unanimously and resolutely support this call, and we must unanimously strive and struggle.

### 一个最迫切的号召

　　一个最迫切的号召
    邵力子
    “迅速按照波茨坦协定缔结对日和约”，是抗日战争十二周年纪念中共中央发出的伟大号召中最迫切的一个。这号召是天经地义的；因为波茨坦协定，不只是对日本提出了最坚定明确的条件，也是同盟国家相互间最神圣的约束，倘若不这样办，那就是把国际信义轻易毁弃，而且对日和约问题，必致永远无法解决，其结果不只危害东亚和平，甚至要危害世界和平的。同时，这也是天公地道的；中国是受日本帝国主义的祸害最大，在抗日战争中牺牲尽力最多的国家，由中苏美英四大国协商，根据波茨坦协定的原则，解决对日和约问题，以防止日本帝国主义的死灰复燃，是最公平合理的。所以这一个号召，我们在今天，必须一致的坚决拥护，一致的努力奋斗，务使对日和约能根据波茨坦协定的原则，迅速缔结完成，使日本不致成为美帝国主义独占的基地，以危害我国和东亚乃至全世界的和平。
    我现在想再说一点关于这个问题在今天所能引起的痛心和愤慨。远在三年半以前，即民国三十五年一月，在重庆召开的政治协商会议，曾通过一个和平建国纲领，那是由参加会议的各党派，以和谐而热烈的情绪所一致通过的；和平建国纲领的第五项外交，第二条关于日本问题，是这样写着：
    “根据波茨坦宣言，肃清日本在中国之残余力量，并与同盟国共谋日本问题之解决，防止日本法西斯军国主义势力之再起，以保障东亚之安全。”
    这一条规定是何等的明白。倘若政治协商会议的决议案不被反动派撕毁，而是以诚意来执行，由真正的全国和平团结，而使中国走上独立自由民主统一的道路，我想日本问题，早可由我国与同盟国家共同解决，对日和约也早已成立，又何致于为了内战倚赖美援，连对日问题也仰美帝国主义的鼻息，使我们八年抗战的流血牺牲不能收得丝毫代价，到今天还需要讨论这对日和约问题呢？这一段历史，我们今天想起来十分痛心，而对于以蒋介石为首的反动派，不能不十分愤恨。
    这些反动派到了最近，还在作垂死的挣扎，更是倒行逆施，不择手段，他们所加于人民的残害，竟至比日本法西斯军阀主义还要残暴。我不能想象他们对于这“按照波茨坦协定迅速缔结对日和约”的号召，要发出怎样无耻的诋毁，因为最近在巴黎举行的四国外长会议中，苏联外长维辛斯基提议，依照波茨坦原则，定期召集有中国参加的外长会议，以准备对日和约，而这一提议是被英美两国外长所拒绝接受的。反动派自己要作美英的应声虫，一定要反过来诬蔑主持正义的人，一定要引用美英两国常说的否决权问题，希图淆惑不明事理的人；他们抛弃了自己曾赞同过的原则，正如同他们撕毁政治协商会议的决议一样。正因为反动派还待彻底肃清，我们更要对于这一号召一致的坚决拥护，更要一致的努力奋斗。
