　　Building the League Must Be Public
  　“China Youth” Magazine Editorial
　　The central committee's publication "China Youth" of the China New Democratic Youth League published an editorial entitled "Building the League Must Be Public" in its twelfth issue, as follows:

　　Since the Youth League's representative congress, generally, the leagues in various regions have been able to establish and consolidate the Youth League based on the spirit of the congress documents. However, some leagues in some cities have not grasped the spirit of the congress tightly, and have even violated the principle of publicly building the league by secretly building the league. Jinan and Luoyang both had secret league-building practices at the beginning of league-building. Some secret youth revolutionary groups before the liberation of Tianjin are still in an underground state. This must be corrected immediately.

　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's resolution on building the league clearly pointed out the policy of publicly building the league, and Comrade Feng Wenbin also emphasized in his conclusion at the Youth League Representative Congress that the league must be built publicly. The secret youth revolutionary groups before liberation must be quickly made public after liberation. Responsible comrades of the Central Committee of the League have given instructions in previous talks.

　　Why should the league be built publicly? Because the league is an advanced youth mass organization, there is no need to keep it secret from the masses. Secrecy only isolates it from the masses, making it difficult for the young masses to trust that the league is their own organization. Publicly building the league is a responsible attitude of the revolutionary organization towards the people. If the league is kept secret, it is not easy to get criticism, help and supervision from the masses; some league organizations or league members with shortcomings and errors will not easily correct their shortcomings and errors with the help of the masses. In addition, secrecy also hinders the active democratic life within the league.

　　Comrades who do not approve of building the league publicly have various reasons or excuses. For example, they say that the league is secret, and the masses do not know. If it is made public, some people will say: "What kind of New Democratic Youth League is this? Isn't it the same as the Kuomintang's Three People's Principles Youth League in the past?" This view is completely incorrect. We must understand that the establishment of the Youth League is mainly based on the needs of the broad masses of young people. Even if a few people have some misunderstandings, we should publicize and explain to them based on the actual work of the league and the documents of the league, so that they understand that the New Democratic Youth League is completely opposite to the Three People's Principles Youth League in essence, otherwise they will continue to misunderstand for a long time. For example, some of our league branches are divorced from the masses, and some of our league members do not do well in their studies. Isn't it damaging to the prestige of the league if it is made public now? It is better to make it public after secretly contacting the masses, and it is better to make it public after secretly making up for the lessons. This view is also incorrect. We must tell the masses honestly about our shortcomings and errors, correct them in front of the masses, and let the masses understand that no organization can be completely without shortcomings and errors. The only question is what attitude various organizations take towards these shortcomings and errors. If we cannot carry out effective criticism and self-criticism in front of the masses, and try to secretly cover up our shortcomings and errors, we will only lose the prestige of the league. Moreover, we rely not only on the help of the leadership and our own efforts to contact the masses and practice our homework, but also on the help and supervision of the masses. In short, the basic mistake of the comrades who advocate building the league secretly is to pit the league against the masses. They have not yet figured out the truth of "Why build the league? What is the league? What should the league do?"

　　In fact, secret league-building in some places has already had a bad impact. For example, when Luoyang was building the league secretly, people outside the league thought that there was no difference between the New Democratic Youth League and the Three People's Principles Youth League. Some young people even stopped talking when they saw league members coming. League members held secret meetings, and some non-league members knew about it and said: "Who are they whispering about again?" Are these facts not enough to illustrate the error of secretly building the league? However, in correcting the secret league-building, adequate preparation must be made. The publication of the league should be fully explained inside and outside the league. Do not make it public for the sake of making it public, and do not adopt the simple method of publishing a list without publicity and brewing. If so, it will still cause misunderstandings among some masses who have never known what the Youth League is all about.

### 建团必须公开　“中国青年”杂志社论

专栏：

　　建团必须公开
  　“中国青年”杂志社论
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会的机关刊物“中国青年”第十二期，以“建团必须公开”为题，发表社论如下：
    在青年团的代表大会以后，各地区的团，一般地都能根据大会文件的精神，建立与巩固青年团。但也有一些城市里的团，掌握大会的精神不紧，甚至违反公开建团的原则，秘密建团。济南、洛阳在开始建团时，都曾有过秘密建团的做法。天津解放前的一些秘密的青年革命小团体，到现在仍然保持地下状态。这是必须立即加以纠正的。
    中国共产党中央的建团决议里，就明确地指出了公开建团的方针，冯文彬同志在青年团代表大会上的结论里，也着重指出必须公开建团。解放前的秘密的青年革命小团体，在解放后必须迅速公开。团中央负责同志在历次谈话中都有过指示。
    为什么要公开建团呢？因为团是先进青年群众性的团体，本来就没有必要向群众秘密。秘密只有与群众隔离，使青年群众不容易信任团是他们自己的组织。公开建团，是革命组织对人民群众负责的态度。团秘密起来，就不易得到群众的批评、帮助与监督；一些有缺点有错误的团的组织或团员，就不易在群众的帮助下来改正自已的缺点和错误。此外，秘密也妨碍团内的民主的活跃的生活。
    不赞成公开建团的同志们，有种种理由或借口。例如说秘密的团，群众不知道，公开了就会有人说：“搞什么新民主主义青年团，还不是和国民党过去搞三青团一样。”这种看法，是完全不正确的。我们必须明白：青年团的建立，主要地是根据广大青年群众的需要。即使有少数人有某些误解，我们应根据团的实际工作和团的文件，向他们宣传解释，使他们了解新民主主义青年团与三青团在本质上完全相反，否则他们就会长期地误会下去了。又例如说，我们有些团支部脱离群众，我们有些团员功课不好，现在公开了，岂不是有损团的威信，不如等秘密地和群众联系好了才公开，不如等秘密地把功课补习好了才公开。这种看法也是不正确的。我们要将我们的缺点和错误，老老实实地告诉群众，当着群众的面来改正，并使群众要了解到，无论什么组织，都不可能完全没有缺点和错误，问题只在于各种组织对这些缺点错误采取什么态度。如果我们不能在群众面前进行有效的批评和自我批评，企图秘密地掩盖自己的缺点和错误，那只有丧失团的威信。而况我们联系群众，练好功课，不仅依靠于领导的帮助和自己的努力，还依靠于群众的帮助和督促。总之，主张秘密建团的同志们的基本的错误，就是把团与群众对立起来。他们还没有弄清楚“为什么建团？团是什么？团应当做什么？”的道理。
    事实上，某些地方秘密建团，已经发生了不好的影响，如洛阳在秘密建团时，团外就有人认为新民主主义青年团和三青团没有区别，甚至有一些青年看见团员来了就停止谈话。团员开秘密会，有的非团员知道了，说：“这又不知道嘀咕谁呢？”这些事实，还不足以说明秘密建团的错误吗？但是，在纠正秘密建团的时候，必须要经过适当的准备。团的公开，应当在团内外作充分的说明。不要为公开而公开，不要采用不经过宣传酝酿，即以一纸名单公开出来的简单方式。如果这样，也仍然会引起某些素来不知青年团是怎样一回事的群众的误解。
