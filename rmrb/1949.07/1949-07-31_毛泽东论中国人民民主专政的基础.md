Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 30th: The Soviet magazine "New Times" published an article on July 20th entitled "Mao Zedong on the Foundation of the People's Democratic Dictatorship in China," giving a detailed introduction to Chairman Mao's work "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." The full text is as follows:

To commemorate the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, wrote a paper entitled "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," which has aroused widespread comment around the world. The article traces the main historical stages of the Chinese national liberation struggle and announces the political program of the victorious people's democracy.

The Chinese proletariat has established its Communist Party for twenty-eight years (since 1921). Mao Zedong wrote: These years are not peaceful years, but years of great storms and tension. "We must fight against enemies at home and abroad, inside and outside the party. Thank you, Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, for giving us weapons. These weapons are not machine guns, but Marxism-Leninism."

After twenty-eight years of political and armed struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have defeated the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique, which represents the interests of landlords, monopoly and bureaucratic capital, and foreign imperialism. Mao Zedong said that in this struggle, the Chinese people have learned two main conditions for victory: "(1) Domestically, arouse the masses. That is, unite the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie, form a domestic united front under the leadership of the working class, and develop from this to establish a people's democratic dictatorship state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance; (2) Internationally, unite with the nations and peoples of all countries who treat us equally, and struggle together. That is to unite with the Soviet Union, unite with the new democratic countries, unite with the proletariat and the broad masses of the people of other countries, and form an international united front."

Mao Zedong emphasized that Sun Yat-sen's forty years of work experience and the twenty-eight years of liberation struggle led by the Communist Party have convinced the Chinese people that they must stand with socialism: "Not only China, but the whole world is the same, either leaning towards imperialism or leaning towards socialism, without exception. Neutrality is disguised, and there is no third road."

Mao Zedong then discussed the issue of international assistance to the People's Democratic China. Without international assistance, the Chinese people cannot consolidate their victory, but from whom can and should democratic China receive assistance? Mao Zedong asked this question. He also gave a clear answer: "Internationally, we belong to the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union. Real friendly assistance can only be found in this direction, and not in the imperialist front."

As for democratic China's trade with other countries, it must and will be conducted "on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty."

Decades of experience have convinced the Chinese people that to protect the interests of the people, oppose domestic reactionaries and foreign imperialism, and ensure national independence, the establishment of the people's democratic dictatorship is necessary. "The foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship is the alliance of the working class, the peasant class, and the urban petty bourgeoisie, mainly the alliance of workers and peasants, because these two classes account for 80 to 90 percent of the Chinese population. Overthrowing imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries mainly relied on the strength of these two classes. The transition from new democracy to socialism mainly depends on the alliance of these two classes. The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class has the most foresight, is selfless, and has the most thorough revolutionary spirit."

Finally, Mao Zedong talked about the task of China's economic development. He said with confidence that this task will also be successfully completed, and in this work, the historical experience of the Soviet people will be of immeasurable benefit to the Chinese people: "The CPSU has won, and under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, they can not only make revolution, but also build. They have built a great, glorious, and splendid socialist country. The CPSU is our best teacher, and we must learn from the CPSU. The international and domestic situations are favorable to us. We can fully rely on the weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship, unite all people in the country except the reactionaries, and steadily reach our destination."

American and Western European capitalist newspapers have not given any nearly complete and objective account of Mao Zedong's paper. On the contrary, they distorted the content and meaning of the important remarks of the Chinese people's leader in order to lead the masses to wrong conclusions. For example, the New York Times tried to tell the American people that Mao Zedong's article pushed the "Cold War" to the Far East. Hamburg Radio said that Mao Zedong called for "a communist government's dictatorship."

But most importantly, Mao Zedong's clear statement – that there is no third intermediate route between imperialism and socialism, that democratic China has chosen the path of friendly alliance with the Soviet Union, and that the Chinese Communists take the CPSU as their teacher – angered the bourgeois newspapers.

　　毛泽东论中国人民民主专政的基础
    苏联新时代杂志
    【新华社布拉格三十日电】七月二十日的苏联“新时代”杂志登载题为“毛泽东论中国人民民主专政的基础”一文，对于毛主席所著“论人民民主专政”，作了详尽的介绍。全文如下：
    为纪念中国共产党成立二十八周年，中共中央委员会主席毛泽东写了一篇以“论人民民主专政”为题的论文，它已引起了全世界广泛的评论。该文追述中国民族解放斗争的主要历史阶段，并宣布了胜利的人民民主的政治纲领。
    中国无产阶级建立它的共产党已二十八年了（从一九二一年起）。毛泽东写道：这些岁月不是和平的岁月，而是大风暴和紧张的岁月。“我们要和国内外党内外的敌人作战。谢谢马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林，他们给了我们以武器。这武器不是机关枪，而是马克思列宁主义。”
    中国人民在共产党领导下，经过二十八年政治和武装的斗争之后，已经战胜了代表地主、独占和官僚资本，以及外国帝国主义利益的蒋介石反动集团。毛泽东说，在这个斗争中，中国人民学到了走向胜利的两个主要条件：“（一）在国内，唤起民众。这就是团结工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，在工人阶级领导之下，结成国内的统一战线，并由此发展到建立工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家；（二）在国外，联合世界上以平等待我之民族及各国人民，共同奋斗。这就是联合苏联，联合各新民主国家，联合其他各国的无产阶级及广大人民，结成国际的统一战线。”
    毛泽东着重地说，孙中山的四十年工作的经验，和由共产党领导的二十八年解放斗争的经验，使中国人民深信他们必须与社会主义站在一起：“不但中国，全世界也是一样，不是倒向帝国主义，就是倒向社会主义，绝无例外。中立是伪装的，第三条道路是没有的。”
    毛泽东接着论到国际上给与人民民主中国援助的问题。没有国际援助，中国人民不能巩固他们的胜利，但是民主中国可以和应该从谁那里得到援助呢？毛泽东这样地问。他也给了一个明确的回答：“我们在国际上是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线一方面的，真正的友谊的援助只能向这一方面去找，而不能向帝国主义战线方面去找。”
    至于民主中国与其他国家的贸易，它必须而且将“在平等、互利和互相尊重领土主权的基础之上”进行。
    几十年的经验，使中国人民相信：要保护人民的利益，反对国内反动派和外国帝国主义，要保证国家的独立，人民民主专政的建立是必须的。“人民民主专政的基础是工人阶级、农民阶级和城市小资产阶级的联盟，而主要是工人和农民的联盟，因为这两个阶级占了中国人口的百分之八十到九十。推翻帝国主义与国民党反动派，主要是这两个阶级的力量。由新民主主义到社会主义，主要依靠这两个阶级的联盟。人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”
    最后毛泽东讲到中国经济发展的任务。他有把握地说：这个任务也会胜利完成的，并且在这个工作中，苏联人民的历史经验将对中国人民有不可限量的裨益：“联共是胜利了，在列宁和斯大林领导之下，他们不但会革命，也会建设。他们已建设起来了一个伟大的光辉灿烂的社会主义国家。联共就是我们最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习。国际的和国内的形势都对我们有利，我们完全可以依靠人民民主专政这个武器，团结全国除了反动派以外的一切人，稳步地走到目的地。”
    美国和西欧资本主义的报纸对毛泽东的论文，没有给予任何一个近乎完整和客观的叙述。相反地，他们歪曲了中国人民领袖的重要言论的内容和意义，以便使群众得到错误的结论。例如纽约时报企图告诉美国人民说，毛泽东的文章使“冷战”发展到远东。汉堡广播说，毛泽东要求“一个共产党政府的独裁”。
    但最主要的是，毛泽东的明确文告——在帝国主义和社会主义间没有第三条中间路线，民主中国已经选择了与苏联友好联盟的路线，以及中国共产党人以联共为师——使资产阶级的报纸感到愤怒。
