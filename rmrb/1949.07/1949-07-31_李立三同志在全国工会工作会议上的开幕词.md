【Ping City News】Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered the following opening speech at the National Trade Union Work Conference on the 23rd of this month:

Comrades:

The National Trade Union Work Conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is now officially open.

It has been exactly one year since the Sixth National Labor Congress last year. In this year, thanks to the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the leadership of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese working class and all the people, it has become a year of liberation and victory for the Chinese people. We have basically defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries, basically destroyed the counter-revolutionary army, and liberated Nanjing, the center of the counter-revolutionary rule for twenty-two years, and Shanghai, the largest city in the country with concentrated economy and industry. The day when we completely achieve national victory of the people's liberation is just around the corner.

To obtain this victory, we should first of all thank Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for their leadership, thank Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all the commanders and fighters of the heroic and skilled People's Liberation Army, and thank the masses of peasants who contributed troops and grain and did their best to support the war. At the same time, we must not forget that this victory, in addition to domestic reasons, also has the assistance of international revolutionary people. First of all, we must thank the people of the Soviet Union and the people of the new democracies in Eastern Europe. At the same time, we must also thank the revolutionary people of Western European countries, who restrained the lion's head of imperialism in the West, which made it possible for us to cut off the tail of imperialism in the East relatively easily and completely destroy its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, in China.

Speaking of our Chinese working class, they have also fulfilled their responsibilities even more greatly in the people's liberation war in the past year. In the rear, in the arms industry, in railway transportation and various industries, our workers have completed their tasks, worked hard to produce, supported the front lines, and produced more production models and labor heroes in the production competition movement. Thanks to their leading role and the efforts of all workers, the soldiers at the front have sufficient weapons and sufficient food and clothing. Wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, our people's railways will be built there. The workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas also truly responded to the call of the Sixth National Labor Congress: welcome the People's Liberation Army, do their best to protect factories and machines, obstruct and prevent the sabotage of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and immediately resume production and restore normal life in the cities after the People's Liberation Army arrived. It can be seen from the actions of the workers in Shenyang, Beiping, Tianjin, Wuhan, Nanjing, and especially Shanghai, that they have gloriously completed their tasks. Therefore, we can say that in the past year, the Chinese working class has basically completed the tasks put forward by the Sixth National Labor Congress.

However, due to the unprecedented speed of national victory, our preparations were not sufficient. Due to our lack of experience, it is a new task to carry out the workers' movement under the new democratic regime, which requires us to explore experience in the work process. Therefore, there have been many shortcomings and errors. Some of these have been quickly corrected, and some are being corrected. In this exploration, we have also accumulated a lot of experience. We believe that this experience can become a good foundation for us to carry out our work in the future.

The national victory and the successive liberation of major industrial cities have put forward new, great, complex and difficult tasks for us, which is to organize the national working masses, further raise their awareness, and take on the task of leading the people of the whole country to carry the revolution through to the end, and at the same time start the arduous task of building the country: we must build a new democratic political power, build a new democratic economy, and build a new democratic culture; we must turn a semi-colonial country into an independent and autonomous country; we must turn a backward semi-feudal agricultural country into a progressive and prosperous industrial country; we must turn a culturally backward country into a country with cultural development; we must turn a country with a very low living standard for the people into a country where all the people can live a life of abundance; in this way, we will prepare the foundation and prepare for the future transition to a socialist society without exploitation, without poverty, and where everyone can enjoy a happy and prosperous life. We, the working class, are duty-bound to take the leading, exemplary and leading role in the work of building a new society and this arduous task. If the People's Liberation Army was the main force in the war, then the working class should be the main force in economic construction. We, the working class, fully understand that we are different from any other ruling class in the past. After the feudal class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie seized power in the past, they used the method of exploiting other classes and squeezing the vast majority of the people to provide for their own enjoyment. The working class is different. We cannot and should not take compensation from other people to make ourselves live a more comfortable life. We, the working class, will only be liberated if the people of the whole country are liberated, and our own lives will only get better if the lives of the people of the whole country get better. Therefore, our working class must fight to the end for the cause of liberating the entire nation and all the people, and must fight to the end for the establishment of an independent, autonomous, democratic, prosperous and strong new democratic China. In order to complete this arduous task and achieve this great goal, the working class must first of all organize itself well and become a huge and organized team, raise its awareness to the level of the advanced working class vanguard, unite all workers, and strive for the petty bourgeoisie and as many free bourgeoisie as possible to fight together. Only in this way can the working class shoulder this great task.

Especially at present, the victory of the Liberation War has also brought some new difficulties. This is because the legacy we inherited is the result of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule selling out the country and harming the people, squeezing the marrow for a long period of twenty-two years, resulting in a poor and dilapidated household. It is also caused by the Kuomintang's internal war under the support and instruction of American imperialism, which destroyed various industrial and agricultural constructions, demolished transportation, blockaded seaports, and so on. At the same time, because the economy was semi-colonial and semi-feudal in the past, and now it must be transformed into a truly independent and autonomous new democratic economy that does not rely on foreign imperialism, those industries that relied on imperialist raw materials and fuels cannot but be temporarily affected. Some industrial and commercial enterprises that used to be exclusively for the enjoyment of landlords, bureaucrats, and warlords must now face the problem of changing their business. The huge military industries of the Kuomintang and our own must now be transformed into peaceful industries, and there must be certain difficulties. In short, in the current transitional period, to transition from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal economy to a new democratic economy, and to gradually reorganize the entire social and economic structure, some temporary difficulties will inevitably occur. But these are difficulties in progress, difficulties in development, and the difficulties themselves bring the power to overcome them. Because we are now advancing on the road of economic construction, and our huge construction work has already begun in some places, we have sufficient resources to achieve huge construction plans through self-reliance. After finally annihilating the Kuomintang reactionary forces, our industrial construction will advance by leaps and bounds, not only can it offset and solve some of the conversion and unemployment problems caused by the economic structure reorganization, but also we are confident that in another three to five years, we can gradually eliminate the serious unemployment phenomenon caused by more than 100 years of imperialist aggression against China and the rule of the feudal comprador system. Now imperialism is trying to suffocate us by creating and deepening our economic difficulties. Their attempt will suffer a complete bankruptcy just like the various conspiracies they have used to harm us in the past. After the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, due to four years of civil war, due to imperialist intervention and blockade, such difficulties also occurred, but the Soviet working class displayed unparalleled heroic and firm spirit, overcame these difficulties, and built a socialist country that is now so strong, prosperous and happy. The Soviet working class is our best teacher and best model. We call on the Chinese working class to learn from our eldest brother, the Soviet working class. We firmly believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class has gone through decades of arduous struggle, overcome difficulties that were incomparably greater than the present ones, defeated imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary forces, and achieved the victory of liberating the whole country. In the future, we will certainly be able to, as in the past, carry forward the unparalleled spirit of hard work, and make even greater efforts to overcome these difficulties in progress. On this point, our working class must become a model for the people of the whole country, and fight to the end for the construction of an independent, autonomous, democratic and prosperous New China.

We trade union workers must understand that in order to complete such a huge task, we must further raise the awareness of the working class throughout the country, truly take the attitude of masters and take on the responsibility of restoring production and developing production, and become a model for the people of the whole country with the spirit of thrift and hard work, on the one hand, supporting the front line and carrying the revolutionary war through to the end, on the other hand, laying the foundation for national economic construction; to achieve this, we must go deep into the masses and carry out extensive explanatory work, and we must quickly organize the workers throughout the country, only by organizing can we become a strong force. Comrade Shaoqi instructed us: to basically organize the working class throughout the country in about a year. The significance of this sentence is not only to organize three million industrial workers, but also to include all handicraft workers, shop assistants, and other mental workers, etc., all of them. That is, to organize more than ten million workers throughout the country in about a year. The proposal of this task is an objective need. The purpose of our trade union work conference is to discuss how to solve the huge tasks facing us.

We should admit that it is precisely because of our lack of work experience in the past that, although everyone has worked hard, there are still many shortcomings. In terms of organization alone, we have serious shortcomings. The first and most common is the mistake of closed-doorism. Therefore, even today, the number of truly organized workers is still very small compared with the vast masses of workers throughout the country. Take the Northeast, where the workers' movement has developed relatively quickly and early, according to statistics, among the more than 1.1 million industrial workers, only more than 499,000 workers are organized, less than 50%. It is even weaker in other regions. The biggest obstacle here is left-leaning closed-doorism; at the same time, on the other hand, there are also mistakes of formalism. The trade union work has not been truly established. The trade union is not established on the principle of voluntariness, but all workers in the factory are registered, and one worker is counted as a member. In addition, there are various complex problems in the organization that need to be solved urgently. Therefore, the first and main issue to be discussed at this conference is the trade union organization issue.

However, the organization issue is not isolated. To organize the working class, it is not enough to simply solve the organization issue. All aspects of the workers' movement are closely linked. If we do not solve the various important issues that have already occurred, our movement will not be able to move forward. Therefore, we hope that this conference will also solve other aspects of the workers' movement, such as the democratization of factory management in public enterprises, the problem of factory management committees and employee representative conferences, such as cooperating with the administration to do a good job in production, the problem of labor protection and welfare, and so on.

In private enterprises, labor-capital relations are also a complex issue. In the past few months, our work has achieved great results. This is due to the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Shaoqi, which enabled us to implement Chairman Mao's policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital more correctly. However, there have also been many deviations in this regard, some of which have not been completely overcome even today. Without solving these problems, the trade union work will not be able to move forward. This conference will also solve this labor-capital relations problem as an important issue.

We also hope to study a preliminary solution to the wage issue at this conference. If we cannot draft a national plan, even if it is a local or regional one, it is good.

These are the issues we want to solve at this conference. Only when these issues are resolved can the trade union work move forward and production can move forward. Because these issues are obstacles to the current restoration and development of production, and obstacles to carrying out trade union work. Although the problem is very complex and difficult, we believe that this conference has cadres from the National Federation of Trade Unions and other relevant parties involved, and will definitely gather national experience to find an appropriate solution. We believe that with the policy indicated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the road pointed out by the resolution of the Sixth National Labor Congress on the current tasks of the workers' movement, the specific instructions on how to implement these policies from the Party Central Committee in the past year, and the experience that our trade union workers have explored in various parts of the country in the past year, we have the possibility to appropriately solve these tasks facing us.

Today's trade union work is not isolated. Not only should trade union workers take on this responsibility, but also the comrades who are administratively responsible in public factories and enterprises should recognize that doing a good job in trade union work is a major link in doing a good job in production and give strong support to trade union work. Trade union workers should also recognize that mobilizing workers to do a good job in production is their main task. The trade union and the administration must cooperate with each other in order to do a good job in the entire production work and also do a good job in the trade union work. Therefore, this conference not only invited trade union workers, but also invited representatives from state enterprise administrative departments and responsible comrades from local labor bureaus to participate, in order to jointly solve the various problems in the current workers' movement.

We want to make this conference a great driving force for the national workers' movement, and a great driving force for the national production cause and the entire revolutionary movement. Therefore, all comrades who attended the conference should understand the important tasks of this conference, and bring out all their knowledge and experience to jointly solve the various problems facing us. We have full confidence that we can solve this task, because our conference is held in the place where Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China are located. If we encounter difficulties that cannot be solved, we can immediately ask our teacher for instructions. Therefore, this conference will surely achieve a victorious success.

### 李立三同志在全国工会工作会议上的开幕词

　　李立三同志在全国工会工作会议上的开幕词
    【平市讯】中华全国总工会副主席李立三本月二十三日在全国工会工作会议上的开幕词：
    诸位同志：
    中华全国总工会召集的全国工会工作会议，现在正式开幕了。
    自从去年六次劳动大会到现在，恰好是一年了。这一年，由于中国共产党中央的领导，由于中国工人阶级和全体人民的伟大领袖毛主席的领导，成了中国人民的解放年，胜利年，我们已经把国民党反动派基本上击垮了；把反革命的军队基本上摧灭了，把反革命统治二十二年的中心南京解放了，把中国经济和工业集中的全国最大的城市上海也解放了。我们完全取得人民解放的全国胜利的日子已经是短时间内的事了。
    这一胜利的获得，我们首先应该感谢毛主席和中国共产党中央的领导，感谢朱总司令和英勇善战的人民解放军全体指战员，感谢出兵出粮尽力支援战争的农民大众。同时，我们不要忘记，这一胜利除了国内的原因之外，还有国际革命人民的援助。这里首先要感谢苏联人民和东欧各新民主主义国家人民，同时也要感谢西欧各国的革命人民，他们把帝国主义的狮子头勒住在西方，这就使得我们有可能比较容易地在东方把帝国主义的尾巴斩断，并把它在中国的走狗蒋介石反动集团彻底摧灭。
    说到我们中国的工人阶级，在这一年来的人民解放战争中，也是更大地尽到了自己的责任的。在后方，在兵工业，在铁路运输和各种工业当中，我们工人都完成了自己的任务，努力生产，支援了前线，并在生产竞赛运动中，产生了更多的生产模范、劳动英雄。由于他们的带头作用与全体工人的努力，使前方战士有足够的武器，足够的衣食，解放军打到哪里，我们人民的铁路便修到哪里。在国民党统治区的工人，同样是真正的响应了全国第六次劳动大会的号召：迎接人民解放军，尽力保护工厂和机器，阻碍和防止国民党反动派的破坏，并在人民解放军到达之后，立刻恢复生产，恢复城市中的正常生活。从沈阳、北平、天津、武汉、南京，特别是上海的工人行动中可以看出，他们是光荣的完成了自己的任务。因此，我们可以说，一年来，中国的工人阶级基本上完成了六次劳动大会所提出的任务。
    但是，由于全国胜利的空前迅速，我们的准备不够充分，由于我们的经验缺乏，在新民主主义政权下面来进行工人运动，是一个新的工作，使我们必须在工作过程当中去摸索经验。因此，就有过不少的缺点和错误。这些，有的已很快纠正了，有的正在纠正。在这个摸索当中，也就给我们积累了不少经验，我们相信，这些经验可以成为我们今后开展工作的很好的基础。
    全国的胜利，各大工业城市的相继解放，向我们提出了新的伟大而复杂困难的任务，就是要把全国工人群众组织起来，更进一步的提高觉悟，负起领导全国人民把革命进行到底，同时开始进行艰巨的建国工作的任务：我们要建设新民主主义的政权，建设新民主主义的经济，建设新民主主义的文化；要把一个半殖民地的国家变成一个独立自主的国家；要把落后的半封建的农业国，变成一个进步的繁荣的工业国；要把文化落后的国家，变成一个文化发展的国家；要把全国人民生活水平很低的国家，变成全国人民都能过丰衣足食生活的国家；这样来准备基础，来准备将来过渡到没有剥削，没有贫困，大家都能享受幸福繁荣生活的社会主义社会去。这个建设新社会的工作，这个艰巨的任务，我们工人阶级是责无旁贷地要担负起带头的模范的领导的作用。如果说，在战争时候，人民解放军是主力军，那么到了经济建设的时候，工人阶级就应该是主力军了。我们工人阶级完全懂得，我们和过去任何其他统治阶级不同，过去封建阶级、官僚资产阶级取得了政权以后，他们是用剥削其他阶级压榨最大多数人民的办法，来供自己享乐的。工人阶级则不同，我们不能够而且也不应该取偿于其他人民，来使我们自己过较优裕的生活，我们工人阶级，只有全国人民得到了解放，自己才会解放，只有全国人民的生活都好起来了，自己的生活才会好起来。所以我们工人阶级要为解放全民族、全体人民的事业而奋斗到底，要为建立独立、自主、民主、富强的新民主主义的中国而奋斗到底。工人阶级要完成这个艰巨的任务，达到这个伟大的目的，首先要把自己好好的组织起来，成为巨大的有组织的队伍，要把自己的觉悟提高起来，提高到先进的工人阶级先锋队的水平，要团结一切劳动者，要争取小资产阶级和尽可能多的自由资产阶级一同奋斗。只有这样，工人阶级才能负担起这一伟大的任务。
    特别在目前，由于解放战争的胜利，同时也带来了一些新的困难。这就是由于我们继承的遗产是国民党反动统治在长期的二十二年中卖国殃民、敲骨吸髓，弄到了民穷财尽的破烂不堪的家务，由于国民党在美帝国主义的支持和指使之下进行内战，破坏各种工业农业的建设，拆毁交通、封锁海港等等原因所造成的。同时由于过去是半殖民地半封建的经济，现在要转变为真正独立自主的不依赖外国帝国主义的新民主主义经济，原来那些依靠帝国主义原料和燃料的工业，不能不受到暂时的影响，过去专供地主、官僚、军阀享乐的某些工商企业，现在不能不发生转业的问题。过去国民党的和我们自己的庞大的军事工业，现在要转变为和平工业，也不能不发生一定的困难。总之，要由半殖民地半封建的经济过渡到新民主主义的经济，在目前过渡时期，要逐渐改组整个社会经济结构，不可避免地要发生某些暂时的困难。但是这是前进中的困难，是发展中的困难，这种困难的本身就带来了克服困难的力量。因为我们现在是向着经济建设的道路上前进，而且我们的巨大建设工作已在某些地方开始，我们有足够的资源来自力更生地实现巨大的建设计划，在最后歼灭了国民党反动势力以后，我们的工业建设便会突飞猛进地向前进展，不只是可以抵偿和解决由于经济结构改组而发生的某些部分的转业和失业问题，而且有把握地说，再过三五年后，便可逐渐消灭帝国主义侵略中国与封建买办制度统治一百多年来所造成严重的失业现象。现在帝国主义正在企图以制造和加深我们经济上困难的办法来窒息我们，他们这种企图会象过去历次使用过的各种危害我们的阴谋一样遭到完全破产。苏联在十月革命后，由于经过四年内战，由于帝国主义的干涉和封锁，也发生过这样的困难，但是苏联工人阶级发挥了无上英勇坚定的精神，战胜了这些困难，建成了现在这样强盛繁荣幸福的社会主义国家。苏联的工人阶级便是我们最好的先生，最好的模范，我们号召中国工人阶级向我们的老大哥苏联工人阶级学习。我们深信，中国工人阶级在毛主席的领导下，经过了几十年的艰苦斗争，克服了比现在大得无可比拟的困难，战胜了帝国主义与国民党反动势力，取得了解放全国的胜利，今后我们一定也能够象过去一样。发扬无上的艰苦奋斗精神，更努一把力，来克服这些前进中的困难。这一点，我们工人阶级一定能够成为全国人民的模范，为建设独立、自主、民主、繁荣的新中国奋斗到底。
    我们工会工作者必须明白，要完成这样巨大的任务，必须使全国工人阶级的觉悟更进一步地提高起来，真正拿出主人翁的态度来负起恢复生产和发展生产的责任，要以节衣缩食艰苦奋斗的精神成为全国人民的模范，一方面支援前线，把革命战争进行到底，另一方面打下全国经济建设的基础；要作到这一点，就要我们深入群众，进行广泛解释工作，就要迅速的把全国工人组织起来，只有组织起来，才能成为强固的力量。少奇同志指示我们：要在一年左右，基本上把全国工人阶级组织起来。这句话的意义，不仅是要组织三百万产业工人，而且包括所有的手工业工人、店员，以及其他的脑力劳动者等等，统统在内。也就是要在一年左右，把全国一千万以上的工人组织起来。这一任务的提出，是客观上的需要。我们这次工会工作会议的目的，就是要来讨论一下，如何解决摆在我们面前的巨大任务。
    我们应当承认：正是由于我们过去的工作经验不够，虽然大家努了力，但是缺点仍旧不少。单是在组织问题方面，我们就有严重的缺点，首先比较普遍的就是关门主义的错误，所以一直到今天，真正有组织的工人数量比起全国广大的工人群众来，还是少得很。就拿工人运动发展比较快比较早的东北来讲，据统计，一百一十几万产业工人当中，有组织的工人还不过四十九万九千余人，还不到百分之五十。在其他地区更薄弱。这里最大的障碍就是左倾关门主义；同时，在另一方面，又存在着有形式主义的错误，没有真正的把工会工作建立起来，工会不是建立在自愿的原则上，而是把全厂所有的工人登记一下，有一个工人就算一个会员。此外，在组织问题上，还有各种各样的复杂问题急待解决。所以，我们这次会议要讨论的第一个而且是主要问题，就是工会组织问题。
    但是，组织问题，不是孤立的，要把工人阶级组织起来，单纯解决组织问题是不够的。工人运动中各方面的问题都是密切联系着的，不把已经发生的各种重要问题加以解决，我们的运动还是无法前进的。所以我们希望在这次会议上，还要解决工人运动中的其他方面的问题，如公营企业中工厂管理民主化问题，工厂管理委员会和职工代表会议问题，如配合行政搞好生产问题，劳动保护与福利工作问题等等。
    在私营企业方面，劳资关系也是个复杂的问题。几个月来我们的工作有很大成绩，这是由于党中央和少奇同志的领导，使我们能够比较正确的执行了毛主席的发展生产劳资两利的方针。可是在这方面也有过不少偏差，有些甚至直到今天还没有完全克服，不解决这些问题，工会工作也就无法前进。这次会议要把这个劳资关系问题同样作为一个重要问题来解决。
    工资问题，我们也希望在这次会议上研究出一个初步的解决办法，如果不能拟出全国性的方案，哪怕是局部的或区域性的也好。
    这就是我们想在这次会议上解决的问题。这些问题解决了，工会工作才能够前进，生产才能够前进。因为这些问题是目前恢复和发展生产中的阻碍，是开展工会工作中的阻碍。问题虽然很复杂、很困难，但是我们相信，这次会议有全国工会工作干部和其他有关方面的干部参加，定能汇集全国经验，来找到适当的解决。我们相信有党中央和毛主席指示的方针，有六次劳动大会关于工人运动当前任务决议案所指明的道路，有党中央最近一年来关于如何实行这些方针的各方面的具体指示，有我们工会工作者一年来在全国各地摸索出来的经验，有了这些，我们就有可能把摆在我们面前的这些任务，加以适当的解决。
    今天的工会工作不是孤立的，不仅工会工作者要负起这个责任，而且公营工厂企业中负行政责任的同志，要把搞好工会工作认清是搞好生产的主要环节而给工会工作以有力的支持。工会工作者也要认清动员工人搞好生产是自己的主要任务，工会与行政必须配合一致，才能够把整个生产工作搞好，也才能把工会工作搞好。因此我们这一次的会议不仅邀请了工会工作者，还邀请了国家企业行政部门的代表和各地劳动局的负责同志参加，以共同的努力来解决目前工人运动中的各种问题。
    我们要使这次会议成为对全国工人运动的一个很大的推动力，对全国的生产事业以及整个的革命运动的一个很大的推动力。所以我们到会的全体同志们，要了解这次到会的重大任务，把自己的知识、经验统统拿出来，共同来解决摆在我们面前的各种问题。我们有充分信心能解决这个任务，因为我们这次会议是在毛主席和中共中央所在的地方举行的，假如遇有困难不能解决，我们立刻可以去请示我们的先生，因此，这次会议一定能够获得胜利的成功。
