　　Tianjin West PLA
  　Helps People Control Rivers and Fight Floods
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The leaders of the People's Liberation Army "61" Unit stationed west of Tianjin issued an urgent notice on July 12th, calling on all commanders and fighters to actively assist local people in repairing dikes and dams to control rivers and combat floods. All troops stationed near the Yongding River, Daqing River, Ziya River, and Beiyun River have now been urgently mobilized. Under the unified command of the local government's river management committee, they are fighting floods together with the broad masses of the people. When a certain regiment's first battalion was repairing the Cizhou dike, the yellow waves rolled under the dike. Some soldiers, not even bothering to take off their clothes, plunged into the rapids, carrying mud back and forth. In six hours, they reinforced a dangerous section 35 steps long. A repair team of over a thousand people from a certain regiment completed the task of repairing a seven-mile-long dike from Quanzi Village to Manziying in the pouring rain. The section responsible for the second battalion was on the verge of a breach. They destroyed and repaired it repeatedly, fighting against the yellow waves, and finally turned danger into safety. Niu Shuyun, the deputy instructor of the second company, took off his shirt in the rain and carried more soil and ran faster than anyone else. Many comrades' shoulders were swollen, but they were still enthusiastic to compete with the villagers. The villagers are very grateful for the sincere and active help from their own army and have written letters to thank them. In one letter, they praised their own troops like this: "The PLA loves the people, truly strong, helping farmers with no rest, filling tanks (drawing water to fill tanks), pulling wheat, repairing dikes and dams, unique in the world." The villagers of Cizhou presented the troops with a banner with the words "Love Our Benevolent Army" written on it. At present, the soldiers and civilians along the river are still working hard together day and night to build dikes and dams to prevent flood attacks.

　　津西解放军
  　助民治河抢险
    【本报讯】驻防天津以西之人民解放军“六一”部诸首长，于七月十二日发出紧急通知，号召全体指战员积极协助地方人民修堤筑坝，治河抢险。凡驻于永定河、大清河、子牙河、北运河沿岸附近之部队，现在都已紧急动员起来，在地方政府治河委员会的统一指挥下，和广大人民一起与水灾搏斗，某团一营在修茨州堤时，堤下黄浪翻滚，战士们有的顾不得脱下衣裳，就扑过急流，来回运泥，六个钟头就把一段长三十五步的险工修牢。某团千余人组成的抢修队，在倾盆大雨下，完成了补修从圈子村到蛮子营七华里长堤的任务。二营负责的一段，眼看决口，他们毁而复修，与黄浪奋斗，终于转危为安。二连副指导员牛书云在雨下光着膀子，比谁担土也多，跑的也快。许多同志的肩头肿了，还是热情的要和老乡竞赛。老乡们对于自己军队这种真诚积极的帮助，非常感激，纷纷写信答谢。在一封信上他们是这样称赞着自己的队伍：“解放军爱民真正强，时刻不歇助农忙，满缸（打水满缸）拔麦修堤坝，天下独一无二双。”茨州老乡赠给部队写着“爱我仁军”四字的锦旗一面。目前沿河军民仍在紧张团结日夜不懈的修筑堤坝，防止水灾的袭击。
