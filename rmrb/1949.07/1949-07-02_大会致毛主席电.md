　　Telegram to Chairman Mao from the Congress
    Chairman Mao:
    All Party members in Beiping, with unparalleled excitement, celebrate the glorious 28th anniversary of the birth of our Party and extend our warmest greetings to you!
    For twenty-eight years, our Party has adhered to the cause of liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. After the Great Revolution, the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, and the People's Liberation War, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and you, we have finally defeated the rule of the heinous Kuomintang reactionaries, the running dogs of imperialism. The final victory nationwide will soon be realized. But as the Party Central Committee and you have repeatedly cautioned us, this is only the first step in a ten-thousand-mile long march. Greater and more complex tasks lie ahead. We will unite closely with the people of the whole country and democratic figures outside the Party, eliminate the conspiracies and sabotage of the remaining counter-revolutionaries, concentrate all our efforts on restoring and developing production and cultural and educational undertakings, and build our country into an independent, free, prosperous, strong, and happy New China.
    In the future, we will continue to maintain a humble, prudent, non-arrogant, non-impetuous, and hard-working style, strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, improve our Marxist-Leninist level, and strive for the rapid victory of the whole country and the success of the construction of a new democratic nation!
    We wish you and the comrades of the Central Committee good health!

　　大会致毛主席电
    毛主席：
    北平全体党员以无比兴奋的心情，庆祝我党诞生光辉的二十八周年纪念日并向你致热烈的敬礼！
    二十八年来，我党坚持中华民族与中国人民的解放事业，经过大革命，土地革命，抗日战争和人民解放战争，在党中央和你的英明领导下，终于打败了帝国主义走狗万恶的国民党反动派的统治，全国最后胜利不久就可实现了。但正如党中央和你所谆谆告诫我们的，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。更伟大更复杂的任务，还在前面，我们将和全国人民及党外民主人士紧密的团结在一起，肃清反革命残余的阴谋破坏，集中一切力量恢复与发展生产事业，及文教事业，把我们的国家建设成一个独立自由富强与幸福的新中国。
    今后，我们将继续保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不燥和艰苦奋斗的作风，加强马列主义理论与和马列主义的普遍真理与中国革命具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的学习，提高自己的马列主义水平，为迅速取得全国胜利和新民主主义国家建设的成功而奋斗！
    祝你和中央同志们的健康！
