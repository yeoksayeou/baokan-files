Yuan Village in Gaoping County, Taiyue, is a typical demonstration village for substitute farming in the Third Special District of Taiyue. According to the spirit of substitute farming, the masses themselves researched and created many methods. Both parties voluntarily negotiate, which is both democratic and ensures responsibility. The Ministry of Civil Affairs of the North China People's Government believes that the substitute farming work in this village is very good and has notified various places to conduct in-depth research and reference.

Yuan Village has a total of 362 households, including 75 households of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and retired soldiers, with 999 mu of land. There are 32 households who should enjoy substitute farming, with 301 mu of land. The first step in carrying out substitute farming work is to publicize and mobilize, understand the situation, review and criticize the shortcomings of substitute farming in the past, explain the benefits of improving substitute farming, open up the minds of cadres, and improve the awareness of the masses. The experience of this village proves that this is the foundation for doing a good job in substitute farming. On specific issues of substitute farming, such as the contract method, the scope of enjoying substitute farming, the yield of substitute farming land, and the number of workdays, detailed explanations should be given to the masses to dispel their concerns and make the households providing substitute farming willing to perform their substitute farming obligations.

After the masses have discussed the ideas, a "three evaluations" are carried out: (1) The number of workdays required by households enjoying substitute farming; (2) The number of land yields; (3) The number of workdays that the masses should bear. First, the revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and village cadres hold a meeting to evaluate and formulate a draft, and then convene a mass meeting to discuss and decide how to do a good job in the "three evaluations." According to the experience of this village, the evaluation of yield should be combined with the neighboring land situation, so that the substitute farming households and the contracting households can negotiate the amount of yield to be paid by the contracting households according to the burden of yield. When evaluating the number of workdays required for the land of households enjoying substitute farming, it should be estimated 10% more than ordinary land, because their land is generally barren due to poor cultivation in the past, and requires more work. Evaluating a few more workdays will not cause the households enjoying substitute farming to suffer losses, and the land can be cultivated well. After the three evaluations are completed, the number of substitute farming workdays enjoyed by revolutionary martyrs and military dependents and the average number of workdays borne by all villagers are officially announced to the masses. A conference of households enjoying substitute farming and households providing substitute farming is convened to freely choose suitable substitute farmers, exchange opinions, and ensure that substitute farming can be done well.

There are the following types of substitute farming methods: (1) Leasing - This is when there are no direct relatives at home after a soldier joins the army. The lessee pays 37.5% of the rent, and the land rent payable is given to the village office every year to issue a receipt. The grain rent is still kept by the lessee and paid together after the soldier returns (according to the Third Special Office, the land rent should be collected and managed by the village office and deposited in the bank in a real way to generate interest for turnover, so that the soldiers will not suffer losses). (2) Contract farming system - Fixed contracts are given to individual substitute farming households, and grain is handed over in the autumn according to the evaluated yield. When households enjoying substitute farming look for people to contract, they all choose someone who is right for them to agree to. (3) Fixed substitute farming system - Only the substitute farmer is fixed. Households enjoying substitute farming can control the production plan themselves and use it whenever they need it. This approach is because they have some labor or livestock themselves, or have more reliable people to manage it for them, and can only assist when something is lacking. Regardless of whether it is contract farming or fixed substitute farming, food and fodder for livestock are provided. Both parties are willing, and the households enjoying substitute farming believe that as long as the land is cultivated well, eating is nothing.

This time, the village strictly organized the sorting out of households enjoying substitute farming, so that those who should enjoy substitute farming would not be missed, and those who should not be substitute farmed would not be substitute farmed, resulting in a waste of labor. When Yuan Village first tried substitute farming in February this year, the statistics at that time showed that there were 84 households of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, workers, and veterans in the village, with 1,051 mu of land, and 42 households were given substitute farming, with 451 mu of land. After this inspection, the number of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, workers, and veterans households was reduced to 75, with 999 mu of land, and the number of households that should enjoy substitute farming was reduced to 32, with 301 mu of land. The reasons for the reduction are: the families of some escaped soldiers have temporarily had their military family status revoked; some martyrs' wives have remarried; and some past collateral relatives of soldiers also enjoyed substitute farming, which was cancelled this time. The result of such a conscientious screening is that, on the one hand, the labor burden on the masses is reduced, and on the other hand, the revolutionary martyrs and military dependents who really should enjoy substitute farming receive sufficient care.

### 太岳高平县原村怎样做好代耕工作

　　太岳高平县原村怎样做好代耕工作
    高平县原村，是太岳三专区的代耕典型示范村。该村根据代耕精神，让群众自己研究与创造了许多办法。双方自愿商定，既民主又能做到认真负责。华北人民政府民政部认为该村代耕工作做法很好，已通报各地，深入研究参考。
    原村共有居民三六二户，其中烈军工属及荣退军人七十五户，土地九百九十九亩。应享受代耕的有三十二户，土地三百零一亩。代耕工作进行的第一步，是宣传动员，了解情况，检讨批判过去代耕的缺点，解释改进代耕的好处，打通干部思想，提高群众觉悟。该村经验证明，这是做好代耕工作的基础。在代耕的具体问题上，如包干的办法，享受代耕的范围，代耕土地的产量和工数等，都要在群众中详细解释，打消群众顾虑，使服代耕户乐于执行代耕义务。
    经过群众思想酝酿后，进行“三评”：（一）享受代耕户需工数；（二）土地产量数；（三）群众应负担工数。先由烈军工属与村干部开会评定，制出草案，再召开群众大会讨论决定如何做好“三评”。根据该村的经验，评定产量应结合地邻情况，让代耕户与承包户根据负担产量，双方酌情约定承包户应缴产量，评定享受代耕户土地所需工数时，应比一般土地多估计一成，因为他们的土地一般由于过去耕种不好而瘠薄，需工较多，多评几个工，代耕户不吃亏，便可以把地种好。三评完成后，即将烈军工属应享代耕工数及全村劳力平均负担工数，正式向群众宣布，召开享受代耕户及服代耕户大会，自由选择合适代耕人，互提意见，保证代耕能做好。
    代耕方式，有以下几种：（一）出租——这是在军人参军后，家里无直系亲属，承租人按千分之三百七十五缴租，将应缴地租，每年给村公所打收据，租粮仍由承租人保管，俟军人回来后，一并偿付（按三专署认为地租应由村公所收管，以折实办法存入银行周转生息，使军人不致吃亏）。（二）包耕制——固定给个别代耕户承包，秋后按评定产量交粮。享受代耕户找人承包时，都是选择自己对劲人应承。（三）固定代耕制——只是固定代耕人，享受代耕户可自己掌握生产计划，需用什么时，随用随唤。这种做法，是因为他们自己有一些劳力或畜力，或有较可靠的人代为经营，只在缺什么时，能来协助一下就可以。不管是包耕或固定代耕，都管饭和管牲口草料，双方两相情愿，享受代耕户认为只要把地种好，吃饭不算什么。
    该村这次组织代耕，曾严格进行了享受代耕户的整理，做到既使应该享受代耕的不被遗漏，又不使那些不该代耕的也被代耕而形成劳力的浪费。原村今年二月第一次试行代耕时，当时统计全村烈、军、工属及荣军共八十四户，土地一零五一亩，给予代耕的达四十二户，土地四五一亩。经过这次检查后，列、军、工属及荣军户数减为七十五户，土地九百九十九亩，应享受代耕的减为三十二户，土地三零一亩。减少的原因是：有些逃亡战士家属暂取消其军属资格；有的烈士妻子改嫁；有的过去军人旁系亲属亦享受代耕而这次取消。这样认真甄别的结果，一方面使群众劳力负担减轻，另一方面也使真正应享受代耕的烈军工属获得足够的照顾。（杰）
