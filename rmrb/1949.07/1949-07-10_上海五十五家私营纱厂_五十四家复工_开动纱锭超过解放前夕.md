Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 9th: Of the fifty-five private cotton mills in Shanghai, fifty-four have successively resumed operations. As of the 22nd of last month, 1,106,980 spindles were in operation, exceeding the number in operation before the liberation of Shanghai. This accounts for approximately 80% of the 1,392,000 spindles capable of operating in these fifty-five mills. Daily yarn production is approximately 1,930 bales (400 pounds per bale), an increase of about 40 bales per day compared to before the liberation of Shanghai. During the Shanghai liberation campaign, the workers and staff of the various mills spontaneously organized factory protection teams, bravely safeguarding the factories, ensuring that all spindles remained intact. After the liberation of Shanghai, the workers and staff of each factory also engaged in political study, resulting in a surge in production enthusiasm and improved production efficiency. Before the liberation of Shanghai, each spindle at the Xinhe Cotton Mill could only produce 0.5 pounds of yarn in 20 hours, but this increased to 0.62 pounds after liberation. At the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill, the output per spindle in 20 hours also increased from 0.62 pounds on May 24th to 0.65 pounds on June 22nd. The fifty-five private cotton mills in Shanghai possess a total of over 1,425,000 spindles, accounting for approximately 61% of the city's total number of spindles.

　　上海五十五家私营纱厂
  　五十四家复工
  　开动纱锭超过解放前夕
    【新华社上海九日电】上海全市五十五家私营纱厂中已有五十四家先后复工。至上月二十二日止，已开动纱锭一百十万六千九百八十枚，超过了上海解放前夕开动的数目，约占该五十五家纱厂中可能运转的纱锭一百三十九万二千枚的百分之八十。每日约出纱一千九百三十余件（一件四百磅），比上海解放前每日约增产四十件。上海解放战役中，各纱厂职工曾自动组织护厂队，英勇护厂，使所有纱锭完好无损。上海解放后，各厂职工又进行了政治学习，因之生产情绪高涨，生产效率提高。信和纱厂在上海解放前，每枚纱锭在二十小时中只能出纱零点五磅，解放后则增至零点六二磅；申新九厂每枚纱锭二十小时的产量也由五月二十四日的零点六二磅增至六月二十二日的零点六五磅。按上海五十五家私营纱厂共拥有纱锭一百四十二万五千余枚，约占全市纱锭总数的百分之六十一。
