Taiyuan Establishes Farmers' Service Center to Facilitate Farmers' Purchasing and Selling in the City
[Taiyuan Electric] The Taiyuan City Farmers' Service Center has been formally established. After the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government entered the city, in order to receive farmers from various places entering the city, help them sell agricultural products, purchase industrial products on their behalf, and reduce intermediate exploitation, preparations for the Farmers' Service Center began in May. In order to facilitate farmers' transactions in the city, the center has specifically established: Farmers' Hostel, Farmers' Restaurant, Farmers' Cart and Horse Station, and Farmers' Agency for Purchasing and Selling, to help farmers promote agricultural products and purchase industrial products, and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Currently, each store and center is actively preparing. The Farmers' Hostel has completed all preparations and officially opened on the 16th of this month. Other stores and centers will be successively opened in early August.
