　　Derris Powder Has Not Reduced Its Effectiveness
    Technical Improvement Division, Ministry of Agriculture
    Derris powder is an effective agent for controlling cotton aphids, but letters from some areas state that the derris powder issued by the Ministry of Agriculture previously, when prepared and used according to the instructions, has very little effect, reduced to the point where 50% or double the amount of solution is needed to be effective. In order to thoroughly understand the insecticidal efficacy of this agent, we conducted efficacy tests on various derris powders stored in Pingjin, and the results were exactly the same as those previously tested, with no reduction in insecticidal efficacy. The agents stored in Cangxian in the Jizhong area, Tangshan in the Jidong area, and the Tianjin Cotton Planting Guidance Area are also intact and effective. There are two possible reasons why the efficacy may be low, and we would like to bring them to everyone's attention: One is that the dilution ratio should be determined according to the type of insect. For example, the Tianjin Cotton Planting Guidance Area's experiment could only dilute to 150 times because they were using it on peach aphids. Although peach aphids and cotton aphids are both aphids, they are not the same species. Peach aphids have a lot of wax on their bodies, and in order to control them, not only should the dilution of the agent be reduced, but also soap or soybean spreading agent must be added, otherwise the medicinal power cannot come into contact with the insect body. Cotton aphids, on the other hand, do not have any wax and can easily come into contact with the insect body. (In the past, when promoting the use of derris powder to control cotton aphids, it was often pointed out that soap or soybean spreading agent should be added. Farmers found this method troublesome, and soap was also expensive. In order to simplify the method of use and reduce the cost of the agent, it has been found through nearly two years of testing that it is also very effective even without soap or soybean spreading agent.) The other reason is the method of mixing. The effective insecticidal ingredient of derris powder is ketone. Ordinary derris root powder contains about 4% to 5% ketone. The finer the roots are ground, the more ketone they contain, and the coarser the roots, the less ketone they contain. The derris powder produced by the First Branch of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory contains approximately 4% ketone. The Dilisi powder (derris powder) previously sold by Japan had two types of ketone content, 2% and 4%. Because the ketone content is different, the dilution multiples with water are also different. In our experiments, the derris powder produced by the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory with 4% ketone content and the Dilisi powder produced by Japan Pesticide Co., Ltd. with 4% ketone content can be diluted with water 1,000 to 1,500 times. The Dilisi powder produced by Korea Mint Co., Ltd. and Japan Pesticide Co., Ltd. with 2% ketone content can be diluted with water up to 900 times. After spraying, the insecticidal rate after 24 hours is as high as 98% for the highest and 82% for the lowest. However, special attention should be paid to the preparation method. Be sure to put one part of derris powder in a small cloth bag, then put it in 900 or 1,000 to 1,500 times of water and rub it with your hands to completely wet the derris powder, and then turn the cloth bag over and wash it clean - this kneading and soaking process is very important. Without kneading, the effect will be reduced or even ineffective. As for spraying, special attention must be paid to thoroughness. Aphids will not die in places where the medicine is not sprayed.

　　鱼藤粉并未减低药效
    农业部技术改进处
    鱼藤粉（地方斯）是治棉蚜的有效药剂，但据有的地区来信说，农业部前所发下的鱼藤粉，按说明书上的配制法配制使用，效力很小，降低到要加百分之五十或倍量的药水才有效。为了彻底了解该药剂杀虫效力，我们特将平津两地所存之各种鱼藤粉进行药效检定试验，结果与过去所试验之结果完全相同，杀虫效力并未减低；冀中区沧县，冀东区唐山和天津植棉指导区等处所存的药剂也都是很完好有效的。发生效力不大的原因，估计可能有两种，特提出来，望各地注意：一个是要按虫种不同而决定稀释量，如天津植棉指导区试验仅能稀释到一百五十倍就是由于他们是用于桃蚜的结果。桃蚜与棉蚜虽然都是蚜虫，但并不是一种。桃蚜身上有很多蜡质，除治它非仅药剂的稀释是要减低，更必须加用肥皂或大豆展着剂才行，否则药力不能与虫体接触；至棉蚜则无何蜡质，容易与虫体接触。（过去推行以鱼藤粉除治棉蚜，也多指出要加用肥皂或大豆展着剂，此种用法农民很感麻烦，而且肥皂价格较高，为简化使用方法与减低药剂成本，经近两年试验结果，虽不用肥皂或大豆展着剂，也很有效）；另一个原因，则是配合的方法问题。按鱼藤粉的杀虫有效成份是酮，普通鱼藤根磨成的粉含酮量是百分之四到百分之五，根子愈细含的酮量愈多，愈粗含的酮量愈少。华北农业机械厂第一分厂所制的鱼藤粉，大约含酮量在百分之四左右，以前日本出售的地力斯粉（鱼藤粉）的含酮量有百分之二和百分之四两种，因为含酮量不同，所以加水稀释倍数也不同。我们的试验稀释量，华北农业机械厂出品含酮百分之四的鱼藤粉和日本农药株式会社出品含酮百分之四的地力斯粉可加水一千倍到一千五百倍，朝鲜薄荷株式会社和日本农药株式会社出品含酮量百分之二的地力斯粉可加水到九百倍，喷射后二十四小时检查，杀虫率高者达百分之九十八，最低者也在百分之八十二，不过调制的方法要特别注意，一定先把鱼藤粉一份装在小布口袋里，然后放在九百或一千到一千五百倍的水中用手揉搓，使鱼藤粉全部浸湿后，再将布袋翻过来洗净——这种揉浸搓湿的配制过程很重要。不经揉搓，效果就会减低甚至无效。至于喷洒则必须特别注意周到，喷不到药的地方，蚜虫也不会死掉。
