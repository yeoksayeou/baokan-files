　　Pingjiaotong Bank Provides Loan of Two Million to Support
    [This Newspaper] To help the private Beiping Dyeing and Weaving Company purchase machines and expand production, Pingjiaotong Bank has provided a loan of RMB 2 million. The company is one of the manufacturers supported by the Beiping Trading Company's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch. After liberation, the factory's output increased, and it felt that the original equipment—32 looms—was insufficient to meet current needs. It planned to raise more than 4 million yuan to purchase ten German-style looms from Shenyang. In addition to raising half of the funds itself, the other half was to be provided by a loan from Jiaotong Bank. This loan was issued in a real-value manner, with an amount of 2 million yuan. Based on yesterday's (5th) price of 15,000 yuan per bolt for the No. 2 Factory's Red Five-Blessings brand, it was equivalent to 133+ bolts of No. 2 Factory's Red Five-Blessings cloth, with a monthly interest rate of 7‰ and a term of four months. Upon maturity, it will be repaid in cash at the then-current market price. (Yu)

　　私营北平染织公司添置机器
  　平交行贷款二百万扶助
    【本报讯】平交通银行为帮助私营北平染织公司添购机器扩大生产，特贷予人民币二百万元。该公司是平贸易公司花纱布分公司所扶植的厂商之一。该厂解放后，产量提高，感到原有的设备——织布机三十二台不敷目前需要，逐拟集资四百余万元到沈阳购买德和式织布机十台。添购机器的资金除半数自筹外，另半数即仰交通银行之贷予。此项贷款以折实方式贷出，款额二百万元，按昨日（五日）本报所载二厂红五福牌价每匹一万五千元折合二厂红五福布一百三十三匹多，实物月息七厘期限四个月，到期后以当时的牌价折现归还。　（宇）
