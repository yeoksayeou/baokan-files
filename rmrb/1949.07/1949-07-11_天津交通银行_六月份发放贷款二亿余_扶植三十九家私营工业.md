Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th — The Tianjin Bank of Communications continues to support private industrial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In June, it issued a total of over 230 million yuan in various loans to 39 enterprises in the chemical, flour, steel, paper, and rubber industries. June was the busy farming season, and coupled with the hot weather and frequent rains, transportation was inconvenient, making it difficult to sell some industrial products and affecting the factories' capital turnover. The factories relied on timely loans from the Bank of Communications to continue production and overcome this unfavorable season. For example, the Shen Xingquan Chemical Factory was in a state of semi-shutdown at the end of May due to poor sales of sodium sulfide. After receiving a loan from the Bank of Communications, it was able to purchase raw materials and continue production. Now that transportation between Tianjin and Shanghai has resumed, sales of sodium sulfide have improved, and by the end of June, the factory had sold more than 2,000 barrels. The factory's output has also increased from an average of 100 barrels per day before the liberation of Tianjin to 140 barrels per day in June. The unified purchasing committee formed by the flour mills obtained a loan of 40 million yuan from the Bank of Communications and has purchased 500,000 jin of wheat from the Xuzhou area to supply production to the various factories. The Yangtze River Paper Mill used the loan to repair damaged newsprint machines and factory buildings, and will be able to produce newspapers in a short period of time. Other paper mills that have received loans are also adding machinery or purchasing raw materials. The Bank of Communications is also piloting a loan-in-kind and return-in-kind loan program for the dyeing and weaving industry, lending the yarn it receives from the textile industry through fixed-order loans to the dyeing and weaving industry, and then recovering cloth or flour sacks in the future. Hua Xin and Jun Xing are the two companies that have received this type of loan. This loan method allows the lender to directly obtain raw materials for production and guarantee profits; and the bank can also reduce the procedures for recovering and reselling the goods, and obtain appropriate in-kind interest to continue expanding capital to support production. The bank is currently continuing to develop this loan business.

　　天津交通银行
  　六月份发放贷款二亿余
  　扶植三十九家私营工业
    【新华社天津十日电】津市交通银行继续扶助有利于国民生计的私营工业，六月份共发各项贷款二亿三千余万元，贷予化工、面粉、钢铁、造纸、橡胶等业共三十九家。六月份正值农忙时期，加以天热多雨，运输不便，致使某些工业品不易推销，影响工厂资金周转。各厂即赖交行及时贷款，得以继续生产，渡过这一不利季节。如慎兴泉化学厂因所产硫化碱销路不畅，五月底曾陷于半停工状态。经交行贷款后，才购进原料继续生产。现津沪交通恢复，硫化碱销路已见好转，六月末该厂即共销出两千多桶。该厂产量亦已由天津解放前平均日产一百桶，增至六月份的日产一百四十桶。各面粉厂组成的统购委员会，由交行贷款四千万元后，已赴徐州一带购得小麦五十万斤，供应各厂生产。长江造纸厂利用贷款修理损坏的报纸机和厂房等，短期内即可出产报纸。其他得到贷款的纸厂也都在添配机件或购买原料。交通银行又对染织业试行贷实收实放款，将该行以定货贷款方式从纺织业收回的纱，再贷给染织业，将来收回布匹或面袋等。得到此项贷款的已有华新、俊兴两家。此种贷款方式，可使贷方直接得到生产原料，并保证利润；而银行方面亦可减少收回实物再行出售的手续，并取得适当的实物利息，继续扩大资金扶助生产。现该行正继续开展此项贷款业务中。
