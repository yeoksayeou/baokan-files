　　[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the opening ceremony of the Summer Youth Academy was held in the Taimiao Park. Students from various schools, holding red flags and beating gongs and drums, lined up into the Taimiao with smiles on their faces. The line stretched from the west to the east of the forest farm behind the Taimiao, near the moat, for about half a li. Before the meeting, gongs, drums, and songs rose one after another. At the beginning of the meeting, the chairman gave an opening speech, saying that the academy was opening today under the creation of the students, and he hoped that the students would correct their thinking and improve their culture after a month and a half of life. Then Comrade Feng Wenbin spoke. He first said: The construction work of the new China falls on the new youth of China. New youth must learn new ideas, new viewpoints, new scientific knowledge, and production technology in order to undertake the task of building a new China. He also put forward suggestions for summer study:
　　(1) Do not miss the opportunity for summer study and achieve physical and mental health.
　　(2) Learn to develop a spirit of mutual assistance, exchange experiences, and lay the foundation for the next semester.
　　(3) Summer study is in its initial stage, and everyone should work together to overcome shortcomings and create their own learning.
　　After Zhang Fan, the Education Director of the Central Youth League School, spoke, Liu＠, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau, called for summarizing the experience of this study to provide opinions for education in Beiping. The secretary of the Shanghai Student Committee said that Shanghai students hoped to be informed of the experience. Comrade Xu Liqun wanted everyone to solve ideological doubts in the study, further their understanding of the revolution, and establish a correct attitude towards learning. When Comrade Liqun was speaking, Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, arrived. Comrade Peng Zhen spoke to everyone amidst warm applause from the students. He first congratulated the 10,000 students for coming to study, hoping that everyone would learn well and play well. Then he instructed the students: study should choose their own direction of study, and study for whom; he pointed out that only by studying for the people can we learn better; secondly, we should study the method of learning, that is, the method of learning materialist dialectics. Finally, students from Beijing Normal University, Girls' No. 1 Middle School, Girls' No. 2 Middle School, Boys' No. 4 Middle School, and Beimang Middle School spoke successively, expressing their personal feelings about the academy and guaranteeing that they would study well.

  　彭真同志指示要为人民学习
    【本报讯】昨日上午十时暑期青年学园开学典礼，在太庙公园举行，各校同学举着红旗，敲着锣鼓，每个人笑容满面地排队进入太庙。队伍将太庙后面靠护城河的林场，从西一直排到东方约有半里多路。开会前，锣鼓、歌声此起彼落。大会开始，主席致开会词，他说学园在同学的创造下今天开学了，希望同学经过一个半月的生活，纠正思想，文化上提高一步。接着冯文彬同志讲话，他首先说：新中国的建设工作是落在中国新青年的身上。新青年就要学习新的思想、新的观点、新的科学知识、生产技术，才能担负起建设新中国的任务，并对暑期学习提出意见：
    （１）不要错过暑期学习的机会，做到身心健康。
    （２）学习发挥互助精神，交流经验，打下下一学期的基础。
    （３）暑假学习是初办，要大家共同克服缺点，创造自己的学习。
    中央团校教育长张帆讲话后，市教育局长柳＠讲话中号召把这次学习经验总结下来，对北平教育提供意见，上海学委书记说上海同学希望把经验告诉他们。许立群同志要大家在学习中解决思想上怀疑问题，对革命更进一步的认识，对学习建立正确的态度。在立群同志讲话时，中共北平市委书记彭真同志来了，彭真同志在同学热烈的掌声中对大家讲话，他首先庆祝一万同学来学习，希望大家学得很好，也玩得很好。接着他指示同学：学习要选定自己学习的方向，研究自己为谁学习；他指出只有为人民学习，才能学习得更好；其次要大家研究学习的方法，就是学习唯物辩证法的方法。最后北师、女一中、女二中、男四中、贝满等校同学先后讲话，发表个人对学园的感想，保证自己很好地学习。会议最后高呼口号：“学习毛泽东，学习他全心全意为人民服务的精神！”并由文工团表演各种节目。（清）
