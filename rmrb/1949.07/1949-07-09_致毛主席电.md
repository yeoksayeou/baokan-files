　　Telegram to Chairman Mao from representatives of all circles of people in Beiping commemorating the 12th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War:

　　Today, on the 12th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, we, the two million people of Beiping City, extend our highest respects to you with boundless excitement. We have experienced the bloody rule of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and have suffered cruel devastation. In those difficult days, you pointed out the direction and path of struggle for us, encouraged us, and guided us, so that we finally achieved liberation. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, headed by you, moved to Beiping to guide us at any time, which makes us feel extremely happy and glorious. Now, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has been overthrown, and the new China of independence, freedom, democracy, unity, and prosperity that we have been eagerly looking forward to for many years has begun to be realized. Looking forward to the bright and splendid future of the new China, with firm confidence, under your wise leadership, we will definitely complete the tasks you have instructed: eliminate the remnants of the reactionaries and suppress the sabotage of the reactionaries; and do everything possible to devote great efforts to the restoration and development of the people's economic and cultural education undertakings, build a brand-new people's democratic Beiping, build a brand-new people's democratic dictatorship of the new China, and become a strong fortress for defending world democracy and peace.
