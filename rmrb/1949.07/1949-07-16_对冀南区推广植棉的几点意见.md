Some Suggestions on Promoting Cotton Planting in the Jinnan District
    Shi Linqi

    This year, Jinnan completed planting over 4.7 million mu of cotton, accounting for 90% of the original task, an increase of 1.72 million mu compared to last year, basically fulfilling the task.

    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the amount of cotton planted in Jinnan generally reached more than 25% of the cultivated land area, while in counties like Nangong, Wei County, Xiajin, and Linqing, it reached 50% to 70%, with a yield of about 30 jin of raw cotton per mu. Last year, the cotton planting area in the entire district only reached 9.7% of the cultivated land, with a yield of 20 jin of raw cotton per mu, a decrease of one-third compared to before the war. As a result of this year's large-scale promotion, the entire district only accounts for a little over 15% of the cultivated land, which is 5.3% more than last year, but still 10% less than before the war. The county with the most this year only accounts for 40% of the cultivated land, such as Xiajin County, which has not reached the pre-war level.

    Those who exceeded the task this time were all non-cotton-producing areas, with small tasks assigned, all below 20% of the cultivated land area, such as Yuanchao, Linzhang, Fudong, Julu, Ningnan, Jize, Qizhi, Guangping, Daming, Wei County, Handan City, Nanhe, Hengshui, Jing County, and Wuyi. However, cotton-producing areas such as Nangong, Wei County, Linqing, Yongzhi, Xiajin, En County, and Ji County, although exceeding 20% of the cultivated land area, did not complete the prescribed tasks and did not exceed 40%. The reasons for this situation, in addition to the different efforts of leaders, cadres, party members, and the masses, also lie in some defects in the plan itself: First, the situation of more wheat planted last year and less autumn land, resulting in a relative decrease in cotton land, was underestimated. Second, the situation of more decentralized land after land reform and the lack of labor and livestock power, which also affected large-scale cotton planting, was also underestimated. Therefore, the assigned tasks were a bit too much. For example, Xiajin assigned cotton planting to account for 49% of the cultivated land, but only completed 40% (9% more than last year); at the same time, some counties, although not cotton-producing areas, still had conditions for cotton planting, but the assigned tasks were less, such as Yuanchao, which assigned 2% but completed 7%.

    This situation shows that when formulating agricultural production plans, in addition to first and foremost basing them on national needs, the plan itself should also pay attention to:

    First, there must be thorough investigation and scientific research. A more detailed understanding of the different geological, climatic, and other natural conditions in various places, the long-term production habits of the masses, and the current production conditions (such as labor and livestock power, fertilizer, seeds, grain, etc.) should be made so that the plan is practical. Some counties, based on the past habits of the masses, although not cotton-producing areas, have greatly increased this year, because their geological and climatic conditions are suitable for cotton planting, and the masses can, under our education and persuasion, change their long-term habits and appropriately promote it; some places, although in the past had the habit of planting a lot of cotton, and their natural conditions are also suitable, but because there are still some difficulties today (mainly not much or no stored grain, and the small pieces of land allocated are first planned for planting grain, as well as insufficient fertilizer, seeds, and labor), which cannot be completely resolved, also affects the immediate large-scale promotion; if these situations are not taken into account, and plans are blindly arranged, it will inevitably lead to improper plan arrangement, and the completion of the plan will be affected.

    Second, agricultural production plans must be longer-term, at least two or three years, so that they can suit the seasonality of agricultural production. To arrange the planting area of different crops, such as wheat land and cotton land, if there is a two- or three-year plan, an appropriate proportion can be allocated, so as not to grab a handful one year and affect each other.

    Secondly, in terms of plan implementation, there are several issues that must be resolved, otherwise the realization of the plan will be affected:

    First, some places lack sufficient understanding of the promotion of cotton planting as a major political task. Now that cities and villages are changing from isolated to connected, agricultural production is not only for the countryside but also for the cities, not only for agriculture but also for industry. Therefore, promoting cotton planting is not just a general task but is an important task to make agricultural production planned to break away from the small-scale production scope of self-sufficiency and move towards the new-democratic economic construction road, and transform the agricultural country into an industrial country. Some cadres adopt a passive attitude such as "plant a little to try," "plant as much as possible!" or "farmers will produce themselves, no leadership needed," precisely because of insufficient understanding of this major political task. Some places, because they combined the study of documents when arranging work, understood today's new situation and why to lead farmers to produce, their thinking improved a step, so the task was completed better.

    This is the primary issue that must be clarified in the minds of party members, cadres, and leaders.

    Second, some places lack sufficient understanding of the combination of implementing the state plan with the economic interests of the masses, thus producing a tendency of coercion and commandism. It is good that many party members and cadres take the lead in setting an example to influence the masses to plant more in fulfilling the task, but some party members and cadres, under duress, have to plant more themselves and then force the masses to plant more, and even "assign planting," "registering mu numbers," forcing the masses to change to planting cotton in order to complete the numbers, thus producing phenomena such as empty sowing, falsely reporting numbers, or changing from planting more to planting less. As a result, some places cannot complete the task, and some places, although completing the task, make the masses dissatisfied, suspicious, and passive, which will affect production. Failing to understand that the state plan itself is combined with the farmers' own economic interests, the state plan cannot be truly realized if it is separated from the masses' own economic interests. Some places work in-depth, specifically calculate accounts, promote the past cotton-planting experiences of typical households, and propose "to get rich, plant cotton." The masses realize that "planting cotton is not only beneficial to the public, but also greatly beneficial to us!" Thus changing from planting less to planting more, completing and exceeding the task.

    The combination of the state plan and the economic interests of the masses is not limited to this, and completing the sowing is only the beginning of the task. The masses still have many ideological concerns about promoting cotton planting, such as: "if more cotton is planted, grain will be expensive, and there will be nothing to eat," "nothing to burn," "the public will buy at a low price in the future," etc. Especially because the masses have no sales channels for the textile and tobacco promoted by the government in the past, they are also skeptical about promoting cotton planting. Therefore, conducting in-depth education for the masses is one aspect, but more importantly, the government's actual guarantee in the future. The main thing is to organize supply and marketing cooperatives so that cotton has a wide sales channel, the price is fair and reasonable, and farmers can exchange for the necessary industrial products. State trade truly makes urban and rural areas mutually beneficial, and products are exchanged everywhere. As the masses in Dong'anren Village, Wei County, said: "Just make cotton more expensive, it is better than planting grain. If charcoal and grain can come from outside, there is no need to call on it next year, see who doesn't plant cotton?" In this way, making it profitable for the masses will win their trust, which will not only guarantee the continued promotion of cotton planting in the future but also enable the masses to consciously and voluntarily overcome the conservative thinking of self-sufficiency and jump out of the scope of small-scale production to produce for the adaptation of cities and industries, making agricultural production embark on the road of new democracy. Conversely, if trust is lost to the masses, it will not only affect the promotion of cotton planting in the future but also affect the realization of other national plans.

    Third, it must be estimated that the masses' current productivity and purchasing power are low, and there are many difficulties, such as insufficient seeds, fertilizers, labor, and livestock power, all of which must be resolved. The solution to these difficulties is that on the one hand, the public should provide certain assistance, such as issuing large-scale loans, lending fertilizer, and local production promotion societies purchasing and adjusting seeds, etc. On the other hand, it must rely on the masses' own strength, such as launching mutual free lending, labor mutual assistance, and mutual use of tools, etc. Simply relying on the public to solve it or simply relying on the masses themselves without the public providing assistance cannot solve the problem completely under the current circumstances. The two must be combined with each other.

    Fourth, the work in the stage after sowing and before harvesting is still very heavy, and it is absolutely impossible to relax and take a break after completing the sowing. It is still necessary to seize the work of weeding, watering, pest control, fertilizing, and subsequent branching. Because cotton is particularly labor-intensive, paying attention to technical guidance and labor mutual assistance in the future is a necessary work to increase production. Otherwise, the yield will be reduced, which will also make the masses lose confidence and affect future promotion.

    The above only raises some issues based on the cotton planting situation in Jinnan for reference and research.

    对冀南区推广植棉的几点意见
    史林琪
    冀南今年完成种棉四百七十多万亩，占原任务百分之九十，比去年多种一百七十二万亩，基本上完成任务。
    抗战以前，冀南种棉数量一般达耕地面积百分之二十五以上，而南宫、威县、夏津、临清等县则达百分之五十到七十，每亩约产净棉三十斤。去年全区种棉面积仅达耕地百分之九点七，每亩产净棉二十斤，比战前减产三分之一。今年大量推广的结果全区亦只占耕地百分之十五强，虽比去年多百分之五点三，但较战前仍少百分之十，今年最多的县亦只占耕地百分之四十，如夏津一县，亦未达战前水平。
    此次种棉超过任务者，均非产棉区，布置任务不大，均在耕地面积百分之二十以下者，如元朝、临漳、阜东、巨鹿、宁南、鸡泽、企之、广平、大名、魏县、邯郸市、南和、衡水、景县、武邑等，而产棉区如南宫、威县、临清、永智、夏津、恩县、冀县等，虽超过耕地面积百分之二十，但未完成规定任务，且均未超过百分之四十。形成这种情形的原因，除因领导、干部、党员、与群众有不同的努力外，在计划本身方面尚有若干缺陷：第一，对去年种麦多，秋地少，种棉地相对减少这一情况估计不足。第二，对土改后土地更加分散，劳、畜力缺乏，亦影响大量种棉这一情况亦估计不足，因而布置任务多了些，如夏津布置种棉占耕地百分之四十九，只完成百分之四十（比去年多种百分之九）；同时，又有些县虽非产棉区，但还有条件种棉，布置任务少了些，如元朝布置百分之二，却完成百分之七。
    这种情况说明，在制订农业生产计划时，除了首先必须根据国家需要外，其计划本身还应注意：
    第一，必须要有周密的调查与科学的研究，对各地不同的地质、气候等自然条件，群众长年的生产习惯以及目前的生产条件等（如劳畜力，肥料，种籽，粮食等），都应有一个较详细的了解，才能使计划切合实际，有些县根据群众过去习惯，虽非产棉区，但今年却比往年大大增加，这就是因其地质、气候等有适宜植棉的条件，群众可以在我们教育说服下，改变长年习惯适当推广；有些地方过去虽有习惯大量种棉，其自然条件也适宜，但因今天尚有某些困难（主要是存粮不多或没有，所分到的小块土地都是首先计划种粮食，以及肥料、种籽、劳力不足等），不能全部解决，亦影响马上大量推广；这些情况若不估计在内，盲目的去布置计划，必会使计划布置失当，计划完成必受影响。
    第二，农业生产计划必须是较长期的，至少是二年或三年的，这样才能适合农业生产的季节性，去布置不同作物的种植面积，就如麦地与棉地，若有二年或三年的计划，就可以分配适当的比例，而不致一年抓一把，互相影响。
    其次在执行计划方面，有几个问题是必须解决的，否则会影响计划的实现：
    第一，有些地方对推广植棉是一个重大的政治任务认识不足。现在城市与乡村由隔离到沟通，农业生产不仅为了乡村，还要为了城市，不仅为了农业，还要为了工业，因此推广植棉就不只是一般的任务，而是使农业生产有计划的脱离自足自给的小生产范围，走上新民主主义经济建设道路，变农业国为工业国的重要任务之一。有些干部采取“种点试试”，“尽量多种吧！”或是“农民自己会生产，不用领导”等消极态度，正是由于对这个重大的政治任务认识不足所致，有些地方由于在布置工作时即结合了学习文件，认识了今天的新形势与为什么要领导农民生产，思想提高一步，因而任务完成也较好。
    这是在党员干部以及领导思想上必须明确的首要问题。
    第二，有些地方对执行国家计划必须与群众的经济利益结合认识不足，因而产生强迫命令的偏向。完成任务中许多党员干部带头起模范影响群众多种是好的，但是有些党员干部，在被迫之下，自己不得不多种，再去勉强群众多种，甚至有“派种”、“登记亩数”，强迫群众改种棉花，以完成数字，因此产生空耧，假报数字，或改多种为少种等现象，这样有些地方就不能完成任务，有些地方虽完成任务但群众不满、怀疑、消极，这都会影响生产。不了解国家计划本身就是与农民自身经济利益结合的，脱离群众自己的经济利益，国家计划即无法真正实现，有些地方工作深入，具体算帐，以过去种棉得到典型户宣传，提出“要发家种棉花”，群众认识到“种棉不光公家有利，咱也利大！”因而改少种为多种，完成并超过了任务。
    国家计划与群众经济利益的结合还不止此，完成播种尚只是任务的开始。群众对推广植棉思想顾虑还很多，如：“种棉多了粮贵，没吃的”，“没烧的”，“公家将来低价收买”等，尤其因群众对过去政府提倡纺织种烟叶现在无销路，故对推广植棉亦怀疑，因此对群众进行深入教育是一方面，但更重要的是今后政府的实际保证。主要是组织供销合作社，使棉花有广大销路，价格公道合理，农民能换回必需工业品，国家贸易真正使城乡互利，各地产品交流，正如威县东安仁村群众说：“只叫棉花贵些，比种粮食强，外边炭和粮食能来，明年不用号召，看谁不种棉花？”这样，使群众有利可图，就能取信于群众，不仅对今后继续推广植棉有了保证，而且能使群众自觉自愿的克服自给自足的保守思想，跳出小生产范围，为适应城市与工业而生产，使农业生产走上新民主主义道路。反之，若失信于群众，则不仅对今后推广植棉受影响，对其他国家计划的实现也将受影响。
    第三、必须估计到群众现在生产力与购买力均低，困难很多，如种籽、肥料、劳力、畜力等均不足，均须予以解决。解决这些困难的办法一方面公家应有一定的扶助，如发放大批贷款，贷肥，及各地生产推进社收购调剂种籽等，一方面又必须依靠群众自己力量，如发动相互自由借贷，劳力互助，互助使用工具等，单纯依靠公家解决或单纯靠群众自己公家不扶助一把，在目前情况下都不能全部解决问题，二者必须互相结合。
    第四，在播种后收获前这一阶段的工作仍是很繁重的，决不可以为完成了播种就可松一口气，歇一歇了，还必须抓紧锄苗、浇苗、除虫、上肥以及以后打杈等各个阶段的工作。因为棉花特别费工，今后注意技术指导，与劳力互助是增产的必要工作，否则产量减低，也会使群众失去信心，影响今后推广。
    以上仅就冀南种棉情况提出一些问题，供参考研究。
