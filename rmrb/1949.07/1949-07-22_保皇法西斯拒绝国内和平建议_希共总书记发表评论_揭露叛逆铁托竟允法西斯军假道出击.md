Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 21st: TASS reports: A few days ago, Radio Free Greece broadcast a commentary by Zachariadis, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party, on the current military and political situation in Greece. Zachariadis emphasized that the Greek Royalist Fascists have rejected all proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Greek issue because they claim that the Greek issue can only be resolved by force. Zachariadis denounced the rumors circulating abroad that Albania and Bulgaria are helping democratic Greece. He said, "The United States stubbornly insists on clearing the border area between Greece and Yugoslavia of democratic forces. The best illustration of this is the Battle of Kaimakchalan, where the Royalist Fascists used Yugoslav territory to attack the democratic forces. Now, the traitorous Tito clique is openly cooperating with American and British imperialism on the Greek issue. Since Yugoslavia began helping the Royalist Fascists, American and British imperialism have ceased to condemn Tito for helping the Greek guerrillas."
    
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 21st: TASS reports: The Free Greece News Agency recently reported a statement from the Supreme Command of the Greek Democratic Army, stating that on July 5th, Greek Royalist Fascist troops operating in the Kaimakchalan area (south of the Vitzi mountains in northern Greece) used Yugoslav territory to attack the democratic forces from the rear. On the same day, at 22:30, Royalist Fascist troops once again passed through Yugoslav territory. The Free Greece News Agency reported that Yugoslav and Greek Royalist Fascist officers held meetings in Yugoslav territory, which were also attended by American and British officers. After the meeting, Yugoslav officers signed an order allowing Royalist Fascist troops unimpeded passage through Yugoslav territory. The head of the Greek Royalist Fascist delegation negotiating this issue was Major Petropoulos, commander of the 516th Battalion of the Royalist Fascist army. After the meeting, Royalist Fascist troops began to pass through Yugoslav territory.

　　保皇法西斯拒绝国内和平建议
  　希共总书记发表评论
    揭露叛逆铁托竟允法西斯军假道出击
    【新华社北平二十一日电】塔斯社讯：几天以前，自由希腊电台广播了希共中央委员会总书记萨查利阿第斯对目前希腊军事与政治形势的评论。萨查利阿第斯着重指出：希腊保皇法西斯已拒绝了一切和平解决希腊问题的建议，因为保皇法西斯宣称，希腊问题只有用武力才能解决。萨查利阿第斯斥责国外流传的所谓阿尔巴尼亚与保加利亚帮助民主希腊的谣言。他说：“美国固执地主张肃清希腊与南斯拉夫交界的边沿区的民主军。在这一点上，最好的说明就是开马克加兰战役，保皇法西斯曾在该战役中利用南斯拉夫的领土来进攻民主军。现在，叛逆的铁托集团在希腊问题上，公开地与美英帝国主义合作。自从南斯拉夫开始帮助保皇法西斯以来，美英帝国主义便不再谴责铁托帮助希腊游击队了。”
    【新华社北平二十一日电】塔斯社讯：自由希腊通讯社最近报道希腊民主军最高统帅部的通告称：七月五日，在开马克加兰区（希腊北部维齐山脉南面）蠢动的希腊保皇法西斯军队，曾通过了南斯拉夫的领土背击民主军。同日二十二时三十分，保皇法西斯军队再度通过南斯拉夫领土。自由希腊通讯社报道称：南斯拉夫和希腊保皇法西斯的军官们，曾在南斯拉夫境内举行会议，美英军官们亦参加了会议。会谈之后，南斯拉夫军官签署了准许保皇法西斯军队在南斯拉夫领土内畅通无阻的命令。商谈此一问题的希腊保皇法西斯的代表团团长为保皇法西斯军队第五一六营营长彼得罗波洛斯。会后，保皇法西斯军的部队就开始通过南斯拉夫领土。
