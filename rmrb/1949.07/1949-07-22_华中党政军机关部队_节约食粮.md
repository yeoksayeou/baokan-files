Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 21st -- Party, government, and military organs and troops in Central China are launching a food conservation campaign. In late June, the CPC Central Committee Central China Bureau and the Fourth Field Army jointly issued instructions calling on front-line troops and rear-area party, government, and military organs to practice strict food conservation to ensure a sufficient supply of military needs during wartime, reduce the burden on the people, and strengthen the forces of production and construction. The instructions stipulate that in July and August, front-line and rear-area troops and organs should reduce food consumption by two liang (approximately 100 grams) per person per day, and warn the entire Party and army that conserving food should be regarded as a crucial key to winning the final victory in the revolutionary war, uniting the people in the new areas, and stabilizing social order in the new areas. The instructions emphasize that Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces have suffered years of exorbitant taxes and levies by the Kuomintang bandits, coupled with poor harvests due to last year's floods. The people have little food reserves, and it is now the time between harvests, making life extremely difficult for the peasants. Therefore, properly handling the food issue is key to military-civilian unity. After the instructions were issued, they immediately received an enthusiastic response from front-line and rear-area troops and organs and have achieved significant results. According to the results of more than ten days of implementation by a certain division, it proves that reducing food consumption by two liang per person per day is not only completely feasible but also does not affect the living standards of the troops. After the communications company of the division implemented this decision, in eleven days, in addition to the two liang to be reduced, an average of more than one liang and five qian (approximately 75 grams) of grain was saved per person. Among the nineteen mess units in a certain regiment, thirteen units had surpluses even after reducing two liang of grain, two units had just enough to eat, and only four units exceeded. The Party committees at all levels of the division unanimously believe that the phenomenon of food waste in the troops has not yet been eradicated, such as exchanging raw grain for cooked food, white flour for noodles or dry rations, coarse grain for fine grain, as well as making too much or too little food, casually eating dry rations, inaccurate statistics of the number of people, over-reporting and over-receiving, and individual units selling or losing grain. According to the statistics of eighteen units in the regiment for four days, the loss of grain reached more than 1,300 jin (approximately 650 kilograms). In order to eliminate the above wasteful phenomena and implement the grain conservation instructions, the Party committee of the division has decided to establish the following system in each mess unit: (1) Establish a daily grain account to record the actual number of people, the amount of grain to be received, and the surplus or shortage of grain. (2) Implement a strict settlement system. The mess accounts of the company will be summarized every ten days and published monthly. (3) Strict payment system for food stamps and vegetable money for people going out. (4) Mobilize all personnel to practice thrift and oppose waste. Party committees at all levels, military and political organs, and company soldiers' committees should take this as one of their regular tasks. The Yangtze River Daily, the organ of the CPC Central Committee Central China Bureau, recently published a short commentary calling on all departments to emulate the spirit of the division in resolutely implementing the decision.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st -- The movement of saving, increasing production, and self-reliance in Nanjing's public and private enterprises is gradually unfolding. The enterprises will strive to streamline organizational structures, use domestic goods as much as possible for raw materials, and practice strict economy and increased production. In addition to power plants, electric lighting plants, and radio factories, which have already launched a movement to save and self-produce materials, the waterworks also carried out work such as reducing redundant personnel and cleaning up waste materials a few days ago. Raw materials used by the plant, such as alum, bleaching powder, and chlorine gas, will now be replaced by domestic products. The privately-owned Nanjing Public Bus Company will convert all its buses to charcoal vehicles from the 19th to save gasoline. The oil output of the state-owned Henghe Oil Press has doubled compared to before. The Agricultural Machinery Company has completed its production increase plan for July, and the August plan focuses on manufacturing tools suitable for farmers' use. Currently, 200 cotton gins, 20 water pumps, and 100 corn shellers have been started to manufacture. The Xiaguan Power Plant of the Nanjing Power Plant has also established a technical research association to improve technology.

　　华中党政军机关部队
  　节约食粮
    【新华社汉口二十一日电】华中党政军机关部队展开粮食节约运动。上月下旬，中共中央华中局与第四野战军已联合发出指示，号召前方部队和后方党政军机关厉行粮食节约，以保证战时军需的充分供给，减轻人民负担，加强生产建设力量。指示规定七、八两个月内，前后方部队机关每人每天减少二两粮食，并告诫全党全军：应把节约粮食作为争取革命战争最后胜利，团结新区人民，稳定新区社会秩序的重要关键。指示着重说明：湘、鄂、赣三省，连年遭受国民党匪帮横征暴敛，加以去年水灾歉收，民间存粮不多，目前又是青黄不接之际，农民生活极为困难，因此妥善地处理粮食问题是军民团结的关键。指示颁布后，立即得到前后方部队机关的热烈响应，并已获得重大成绩。据某师执行十余天的结果，证明每天每人节约二两粮食，不但完全可以做到，且并不影响部队的生活水平。该师通讯连执行此项决定后，十一天内，除应减少的二两外，平均每人还节余粮食一两五钱多。某团十九个伙食单位中，有十三个单位减少二两粮食后仍有节余，两个单位恰好够吃，只四个单位超过。该师各级党委一致认为，目前部队的粮食浪费现象依然未能根除，如以生换熟，以白面换面条或干粮，以粗换细，以及做饭时多时少，随便吃干粮，统计人数不确，多报多领，个别单位变卖或丢失粮食等。根据该团十八个单位四天的统计，损失粮食即达一千三百余斤。为杜绝以上浪费现象，贯彻节粮指示，该师党委已决定在各伙食单位建立以下制度：（一）建立粮秣日记帐，每日记载实有人数，应领粮数，超过或节余粮食。（二）严格结算制。连队伙食帐目每旬小结一次，每月公布一次。（三）严格外出人员粮票菜金支付制。（四）发动全体人员实行节约，反对浪费，各级党委和军政机关及连队军人委员会应以此为经常工作之一。中共中央华中局机关报长江日报，顷特发表短评，号召各部门效法该师坚决执行决定的精神。
    【新华社南京二十一日电】南京公私企业中节约增产、自力更生的运动，正逐渐展开。各企业将在组织机构上力求精简，原料上尽量采用国货，并厉行节约增产。各企业除发电厂、电照厂、无线电厂等单位已展开节省和自制材料运动外，自来水厂亦于日前进行了减少冗员与清理废料等工作。该厂所用原料如明矾、漂白粉、＠气等，今后将一律改用国货。私营南京公共汽车公司从十九日起将全部汽车改装为木炭车，以节省汽油。公营恒和榨油厂油产量则已较前增加一倍，农业机械公司七月份增产计划已完成，八月份计划以制造适合农民使用的工具为主，现已开始制造的有轧花机二百部，抽水机二十部，玉米脱皮机一百部。南京电厂下关发电所亦成立技术研究会，以改进技术。
