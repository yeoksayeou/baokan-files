Shen Junru Represents Various Democratic Parties in Congratulating
　　Following this, Mr. Shen Junru, representing all the democratic parties of the country, extended his highest respect to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all comrades of the Communist Party of China. He said: The reason why the Chinese people have achieved today's unprecedented victory is very simple, "It is because there is the Communist Party of China." He believes that Chairman Mao's "July 1st" essay summarized the basic experience of the Chinese revolution, and the people of the whole country should recognize this experience and accept this program. Finally, Mr. Shen, representing the democratic parties, shouted: "Long live the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao!" "Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!"
　　Mr. Guo Moruo said in an extremely excited tone: Today is the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, and it should be a great National Day for the people of the whole country. The people of the whole country should celebrate this day with full enthusiasm. Today, almost all the people of the country will sing a song: "Without the Communist Party of China, there would be no China!" He said: "That's right, if China did not have the Communist Party, China would have been buried in the hands of a group of traitors long ago." The ancient China of five thousand years has become younger with the birth of the Communist Party of China, and Chairman Mao's epoch-making and great "July 1st" essay is a concentrated expression of the will of the people of the whole country, which guarantees that the new democratic society of the Chinese people will enter a happy socialist society. Finally, Mr. Guo ended his speech with a recitation of a poem of praise. The conference also passed a telegram to Chairman Mao. After the meeting, a grand celebration party was held.

　　沈钧儒代表各民主党派祝贺
    继由沈钧儒先生代表全国各民主党派，向中国共产党中央委员会毛泽东主席、中国人民解放军朱总司令及中国共产党全体党员同志们致崇高的敬礼。他说：中国人民之所以获得今日空前的胜利，原因很简单，“就是有了中国共产党”。他认为毛主席“七一”论文，总结了中国革命的基本经验，全国人民都应当承认这个经验，应当接受这个纲领。最后，沈老先生代表各民主党派高呼：“中国共产党毛主席万岁！”“中国人民解放军朱总司令万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    郭沫若先生以极兴奋的语调说：今天中国共产党二十八岁诞辰，应该是全国人民伟大的国庆。全国人民要以满腔的热情来庆贺这一个日子。今天全国人民差不多都会唱一个歌子：“没有中国共产党就没有中国！”他说：“不错，中国如果没有共产党，中国早在一群卖国贼的手里葬送了。”五千年古老的中国，随着中国共产党的诞生而年青了，而毛主席在今天划时代伟大的“七一”论文，是全国人民的意志的集中表现，它保证了中国人民新民主主义社会进入美满的社会主义社会。最后，郭先生以朗诵颂诗结束他的讲话。大会并通过了致毛主席电。会毕，并举行盛大的庆祝晚会。
