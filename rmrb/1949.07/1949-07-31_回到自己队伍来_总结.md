　　Summary of "Returning to One's Own Ranks"
　　Chen Bo'er　Cheng Yin
　　This summary is compiled based on the speeches of Comrade Chen Bo'er, head of the Art Department, and Comrade Cheng Yin, the screenwriter and director, at the summary meeting of the film crew. After the compilation, since both Comrade Chen Bo'er and Comrade Cheng Yin left the factory to go to Beiping to attend the Literary and Art Congress, it has not been reviewed by them. If there are any discrepancies or inappropriate points, the compiler should be responsible. Compiler: Li Mang

　　Our second artistic film, "Returning to One's Own Ranks," is completed.

　　The script for this work was completed in the autumn of 1948 and filming began in January 1949. It depicts the relationship between the army and the people when a unit of our army advanced into the enemy-occupied area in the early winter of 1947. Now it seems that the theme of the script has become outdated and untimely with the rapid development of the situation. Originally, when reviewing the script, we saw that its theme was not as clear and focused as "The Bridge." However, because the requirements for scripts were relatively low at that time, and we started from the perspective of training cadres and starting with small productions, we decided to start filming. Now, from the perspective of studying the theme and improving the ideological nature of creation, it is worthwhile to analyze the shortcomings of the theme:

　　A. Screenwriting Aspects

　　First, the theme is not concentrated enough or sharp enough. After watching this film, it is difficult to immediately say clearly what its theme is and what it mainly expresses. If it is said to be about the relationship between the army and the people, then it is only for the first half. In the second half, when the old man goes to find his son, the relationship between the army and the people is broken, and it is not carried through to the end. Although there is a contrast with the Kuomintang side, it also fails to illustrate this point. The original intention of the old man to find his son was merely to bring his son back, and he did not think about striving for an uprising. However, the script developed into an uprising, and the author did not lay out the clues for the uprising in the previous section. According to the original intention of the author, he wanted to write about the old man finding his son and use his experiences of hardships along the way and the cruel treatment he received from the Kuomintang to highlight how the Communist Party cared for the people. This explains why he wanted to bring his son back. However, the son and other Kuomintang soldiers had been mistreated, and they subjectively had the idea of "not doing it anymore." After hearing the old man's propaganda, they promoted the action of the squad's uprising. Therefore, the depiction of the uprising is relatively sudden and weak. Therefore, after watching this film, we feel that the theme is not concentrated or clear enough. But does this film explain the problem? The theme that it explains still exists. It shows that the old people in the new district initially did not understand the People's Liberation Army. Later, through actual contact, they realized that the People's Liberation Army was their own army and confirmed the deception of the Kuomintang's false propaganda. It shows that whether it is the broad masses of the people or the broad masses of Kuomintang soldiers, once they understand the truth, they will all support the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army and are willing to come over to this side. This still has considerable educational significance for the troops and the masses in terms of army-people relations. However, the film only emphasized the influence of our army's actual work and ignored the Wu family's due understanding of the Liberation Army. Other issues, such as the handling of the speaking scene in the bunker, lack military knowledge; the introduction of the Wu family's composition is not clear enough; and the failure to show how to commend those who have made meritorious service in the uprising, all show that the content is not complete enough.

　　Second, the structure of the story only develops within the narrow confines of reality. This is mainly because the screenwriter has concerns and constraints in his thinking. He believes that writing within the circle of reality will not lead to major errors. He failed to synthesize and analyze materials based on the development of reality, or seize typical examples and boldly create. We must break through the screenwriter's obstacles—concerns and constraints. For example, the conversation between the soldier and his superiors in the Soviet film "An Ordinary Soldier" is very humorous, very serious, but also lively and clear. We also have this situation in our army life, but we dare not write it like that, fearing that the audience will not accept it. Many people have been hindered by this in their creation, especially in this film. The director said: "The success or failure of this film is not important, the only thing we fear is making mistakes." So this film has formed the characteristic of being "stable and steady." This is an advantage when expressed in work leadership, but not an advantage when expressed in creation. Artistic creation should have rich imagination, sharp writing, and clearly express the theme. In summary, in terms of script creation, the level of political and artistic thought is not high, life is lacking, and film technology is not proficient. In the future, only by persisting in work, intensifying political study, and more meticulously studying the business under the contradiction of creative difficulties and the need to produce films can we gradually improve political thought, art, and technical level.

　　B. Directing Aspects

　　The director's planning during the preparation period was not detailed enough, and he failed to sufficiently study the characters' personalities in the script. Instead, he focused more energy on the storyboarding. During the filming process, he also failed to take into account the environment surrounding each shot and each scene. For example, the "bunker" scene failed to connect well with the battle situation outside, resulting in a very unreasonable phenomenon. If this film was not written and directed by the same person, then the director could have done a better job based on the script. Now it is not like this, because the screenwriter and director are the same person, and the director has been trapped by the story of the script himself, making it difficult to develop new things. Therefore, in some major scenes, he failed to exert the due effort and simply narrated it plainly, only telling the audience a rough outline of the story, which was not vivid enough and failed to express the details and inner emotions. In other words, he failed to achieve "fine carving." For example, the scene where the People's Liberation Army chased and captured the grain robbed by the bandits, and Wang Dahe carried it back for the old man, moved many people. However, this emotion was mainly due to the old man's acting skills rather than the director giving it to the audience. Another example is the scene of digging fortifications. The main purpose of this scene is not to introduce the scale of the war, but to describe how the old man was captured and forced to dig trenches, and how the same captured people were exhausted, bleeding, sweating, beaten, and scolded. It should have been portrayed more deeply the Kuomintang's ferocity and the people's indignation. But this scene makes people feel like a concept, just the outline of digging trenches, and nothing is exciting. The whole film is relatively bland, which is related to the lack of focus on the theme, but also because it failed to further develop on the existing weight. In some places, there is room for improvement. The main key is: on the one hand, in creation, we should eliminate the ideological concerns of being afraid of making mistakes, break through the constraints of narrow reality, carefully analyze and synthesize reality, seize typical examples, and boldly create; on the other hand, we must overcome the blitz-like "sweeping and careless" approach and develop the style of "careful study and fine carving." Only in this way can we create new themes and new characters of the new era, and can we obtain more excellent works.

　　C. Actors and Technical Departments

　　Actors—the performances were very good. Everyone was on the screen for the first time, and they were able to achieve such results—they all performed their roles well. Among them, Su Li (who played the bandit company commander) acted more naturally; the liberated soldier Wang Dahe acted very nervously, but not slick; this is good, this kind of role is easy to play slickly; Da Gang, the old man, and the squad leader were all competent, and the child was not bad. The shortcomings are: the general acting skills are mostly things from the stage, giving people a somewhat unnatural feeling; the lines were initially fast, and after correction, they were slow and light, but due to the lack of film experience, the expression of emotions was limited, and it seemed stiff.

　　Photography—the interior scenes were shot very clearly, and the assistant did a good job in following the focus. But the night scenes, the mastery of light is not enough, the first scene failed to achieve the imagined effect. On the one hand, it was due to the bad weather, and four different kinds of film were used back and forth. On the other hand, it was also due to the low technical level. In the future, we should establish close contact with the processing and printing aspects, and master the sensitivity and aperture well, and we should also pay attention to composition, and try to be "beautiful" on the principle that the masses can understand.

　　Sound recording—achieved clarity and won praise. However, there is an experience here: when the sound volume is good when played in the factory, it seems not loud enough when taken to the cinema for screening. In the future, we should study how to make the sound suitable for cinema screening. In addition, due to the director's insufficient planning, some problems occurred in the presence or absence of music and sound effects and their mutual coordination. The actors did not have film training, and the words were read quickly and unclearly. Although there was gradual progress later, the tone of the actors was not well selected in advance, and some lines made a "chi" sound, which was caused by the actor's dental sound when reading the words. Secondly, because the water used to develop the sound tape was not clean, many traces were left, generating some noise. This is worth the attention and improvement of the processing and printing aspects.

　　Art design—basically realized the director's intentions and also created the necessary atmosphere. For example, the atmosphere of "bunker," "Wu family's bad house," and "Wu family's courtyard" were very strong. The background was full of realism, unifying the feeling of the background and the foreground. However, due to experience, it failed to closely connect with the lighting, such as the color tone of "Wu family's bad house" being too gray. In the future, we should study the effect produced by the color tone after it passes through the film and improve it. The props generally completed the task, but they were not full enough. On the whole, there are still rough problems, such as the mud falling off in "Wu family's good house" and the effect of "bandit's living room" being too stiff.

　　Lighting—overall, it is very good. Several night scenes—"between fortifications," "burning incense," "sleeping in the bad house," and "courtyard scene"—can be seen clearly and have an atmosphere. The shortcomings are: some scenes are not very good, such as the night scene of "Wu family's good house" being too bright, the mastery of the lights being poor, and the atmosphere of the two night scenes of the "bandits" not being enough. However, changing several different films also increased the difficulty of lighting. After watching the "material film" several times, Comrade Chen Tian, ​​the lighting technician, proactively reviewed the shortcomings of the lights in the "NG" found and humbly accepted opinions, overcoming the shortcomings of the night scene being too bright and flat at the beginning. This enthusiasm for improving technology on the existing basis with a scientific attitude is worthy of praise. The main thing in the future is to boldly strengthen the artistry of lighting.

　　D. Cooperative Relationship

　　Since the start of filming, the director and the party branch secretary have implemented the spirit of promoting democratic style and giving play to the collective strength into the work; and they have gradually overcome the shortcomings by using meeting life in a timely manner. The administrative meetings included: a mobilization meeting at the beginning of the work and a summary meeting at the end; a technical joint meeting attended by heads of various departments; and a work review meeting held at any time according to specific circumstances.

　　1. Technical Joint Meeting—is a mass organization that implements the mass line and the spirit of collectivism; soliciting everyone's opinions in advance and thinking of ways—carrying out work under the centralized leadership and unified will on the spot. First, the director formulates a work plan (ordered once a week) based on everyone's discussion and assigns specific tasks to each group leader. After the group leaders execute it, they report to the director, and everyone meets each other. Once the conditions are mature, a technical joint meeting is held to discuss the script content, the director's intentions, and the preliminary storyboard sequence jointly discussed by the director, the photographer, and the production manager, as well as the positions of the camera, the tape recorder, and the lights, and draw it into a flat drawing so that everyone understands how to carry out their work. Then, each group leader convenes a group meeting of each technical department (individual groups are not frequent enough) to convey the discussion items and decisions of the technical joint meeting, solicit the opinions of all comrades (if there are any opinions, immediately report them to the director), and specifically arrange the group work. In this way, the director's intentions and specific work sequences and methods are conveyed from the director all the way to the lowest level; after the first shot is taken on the spot, there is no need to say anything, and the position of the second shot is immediately set up. Before each actual shooting, the director uses the time when other groups are preparing to help the actors conduct a general rehearsal in the form of a stage play, and then rehearses with the technical departments in accordance with the storyboard sequence. During this time, the photographer and the recording engineer are present to observe in order to test whether the storyboard is appropriate. After that, the director makes the final decision and discusses it with everyone. If there are no difficulties, the actual shooting is carried out in a concentrated manner. The referred film is printed as a "material film", and after everyone has seen it, the group meeting is immediately studied and reported to the joint meeting for research, and lessons are learned. This solves an ideological problem; everyone does not think that this is the director's business alone, but a collective work that everyone is responsible for. Everyone actively puts forward opinions starting from doing a good job. Even if there are technical disputes, they are all very humble. After the director's unified concentration, most comrades can obey ideologically; and in specific actions, except for some opinions on mutual assistance from individual departments in the initial stage, there has never been a phenomenon of not helping each other. At the same time, the director himself humbly accepts everyone's opinions and learns from everyone; for example, at the beginning of the filming, the director helped the actors rehearse the play, and after confirming the angle with the photographer, he ignored whether the sound was appropriate, and the recording engineer was just joining the revolution and did not know the relationship between the upper and lower levels of the revolutionary team. He thought: "In the old society's film factory, how could the recording engineer give opinions to the director; I'll do whatever the director says; knowing that the sound is not good, let it go!" He didn't say a word for a week. Later, he saw the director's and everyone's humble working attitude and the help of other comrades in the recording team, and finally gave his opinion to the director. The director encouraged him and said: "Your opinion is very good, you should have raised it long ago. I am doing art films for the first time and have no experience. In the future, as long as it is good for the work, feel free to raise any opinions, no matter how big or small." From then on, the director also paid attention to the sound, and the recording engineer also said: "Although the variator is old, why don't we in this line of work try to do it as well as possible!" Finally, he overcame the difficulties and completed the task well.

　　2. Unity and Mutual Assistance—The director and the party branch secretary went deep into the masses, even doing it themselves in labor, promptly discovered and solved problems, and promoted the style of unity and mutual assistance. For example, at the beginning of filming, the art team believed that the lighting team should tie up the lamp stands, and the lighting team believed that the art team should do it. No one wanted to take care of it. Later, the director and the party branch secretary promptly mobilized everyone to unite and help each other. Comrade Jun Da actively helped to mix mud, move bricks, and build bunkers. Once, they dismantled and built two sets in less than a night; the vast majority of comrades either helped to carry lamp stands or hold reflectors, giving full play to the initiative of mutual assistance. The art team and the lighting team finally made self-criticisms to each other and no longer shied away from each other. All comrades have been implementing this excellent style to the end.

　　In short, everyone can start from doing a good job, and through timely and sincere criticism and self-criticism, they have achieved close unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation ideologically.

　　E. Estimation of Achievements and Their Reasons

　　Judging by the standards of everyone being a newcomer, this product can be said to be above a considerable level. The director used to work in the army and has been in the factory for less than two years. He has only filmed one documentary—"Dongying Nursery." This time, as a study and starting from ensuring production, he wrote and directed this film and led everyone to constantly overcome various difficulties, and it is very rare and valuable to receive such achievements; the actors can achieve such achievements on the screen for the first time, which is not easy; photography, art design, etc. are also newcomers, and the technical level of this film is not lower than other products, and even better than some films.

　　However, the completion of this work is mainly reflected in the achievements of organizational leadership more than in artistic achievements. The reasons are:

　　First, it is because the director has excellent organizational leadership ability. Comrade Zhu Ge, the party branch secretary, said: "The director can calmly and decisively handle problems and humbly listen to everyone's opinions, so everyone is particularly assured about the work." From this sentence, it can be seen that the director's support and organizational leadership of this work has a certain quite correct basic attitude and method.

　　Second, the party branch played a backbone role, which was able to promote the work and make it complete smoothly. Party members also played a leading role, and everyone worked hard in a difficult life without complaint, otherwise this would be impossible.

　　Third, it is the performance of the progress of all comrades. Other film crews also have party branches and party members, why is the cooperative relationship not good enough? This responsibility should be borne by everyone. And this group can cooperate very well, so that the work does not suffer losses. This is the result of everyone being responsible for the work and the factory, which is also a manifestation of progress.

　　Fourth, the style and working attitude of the comrades of the Military and Political University gave us a strong impetus. They influenced and promoted our progress in politics, organizational concepts, and responsible attitudes. We are very grateful to them.

　　F. Main Experiences and Lessons

　　Training film cadres is not that mysterious or difficult. The director's first main task is to master the ideological content; after grasping the content, following the general film regulations and groping forward, you can develop to a certain technical level. From another perspective, new directors are less bound by old technical forms. Therefore, in the future films, new directors should, based on the actual experience of this time, put forward more new creations, whether in art, technology, or organizational leadership, and contribute to our new film industry.

### “回到自己队伍来”总结

　　“回到自己队伍来”总结
    陈波儿　成荫
    这篇总结是根据摄制组总结大会上，艺术处长陈波儿同志及编导成荫同志的发言整理的。整理之后，因陈波儿同志及成荫同志都离厂去北平参加文代大会，没有经过他们的审阅，如有出入及不妥处，应由整理者负责。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　整理者：李芒
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    我们的第二部艺术片——“回到自己队伍来”完成了。
    这部作品是在一九四八年秋季写完剧本，一九四九年一月开始摄制；是描写一九四七年初冬，我军一部挺入敌占区时的军民关系的。现在看起来，剧本的主题，随着形势的飞跃开展，已经显得陈旧不及时了。本来在通过剧本时，我们就看到它的主题不象“桥”那样明确集中；但是因为那时候对于剧本的要求比较低，从培养干部，从小作起出发，才决定开拍的。现在从研究主题，提高创作的思想性出发，不妨把主题的缺点分析一下：
　　甲、编剧方面
    第一，主题思想不够集中，不够尖锐，看完这部片子很难一下就说清它的主题是什么内容，主要表现的是什么？如果说是写军民关系，那末仅仅前半截是，后半截老头去找他儿子时军与民的关系就断了，没有贯彻到底，虽然有国民党那方面的对照，但也未能说明这一点。老头去找儿子的本意，本来仅仅是把儿子找回来，并未想到争取起义，而剧本却发展成起义，而且作者在前一段又没布置起义的线索。按本来的作者企图是想写老头去找儿子，用他在途中如何经历千辛万苦，受国民党凶恶残暴的待遇来衬托出共产党是怎样爱护老百姓的；这也就是说明了他为什么要把儿子找回来了。但儿子和其他国民党士兵受过虐待，主观上也有“不干”的想法，又听到老头的宣传，乃促成了那个班起义的行动。于是对起义的描写是比较突然而无力了。因此我们看完这部片子之后觉得主题思想不集中、不明确。但这部片子是否说明了问题呢？说明的主题思想还是有的，它是表现了新区老百姓起初不了解人民解放军，后来从实际接触中认识了人民解放军是自己的队伍，证实了国民党伪宣传的欺骗性，说明了不管广大老百姓也好，广大的国民党士兵也好，一经了解实情，他们全都会拥护共产党和人民解放军而愿意跑到这方面来，这在军民关系上对部队及群众还是有着相当教育意义的。不过在片子里只强调了我军实际工作的影响，而忽略了吴家对解放军应有的认识。其他如在地堡里讲话场面的处理，缺乏军事知识；对吴家成份介绍不够清楚；没有表现对起义立功的人如何进行表扬等，这都说明内容还不够完整。
    第二、故事的结构只局限在狭隘的现实中间来发展，这主要是因为剧作者在思想上有顾虑、有约束，认为在现实的圈子里写，总不会出大错误；未能根据现实的发展去综合、去分析材料，或抓住典型大胆地去创作。我们要突破剧作的障碍物——顾虑和约束，比如苏联片“一个普通的战士”里的战士和上级之间的谈话，很幽默，很严肃但又是生动而明朗的。在我们部队生活里也有这种情形，但是，我们就不敢这样写，怕观众不能接受。很多人在创作上都受到了这个阻碍，尤其是在这部片子上表现得更多些。导演说：“此片成败不要紧，只怕犯错误。”所以这部片形成了“四平八稳”的特点，这若表现在工作领导上是优点，表现在创作上则不是优点。艺术创作应该是有丰富的想象，尖锐的笔法，明确地去表现主题。总起来说，在剧本创作上，政治和艺术思想水平不高，生活贫乏，电影技术不熟练。今后只有在创作困难而又必须出片的矛盾下，坚持工作，加紧政治学习，更加细致地钻研业务，逐渐提高政治思想、艺术与技术水平。
　　乙、导演方面
    导演在准备期间计划不够细致，未能足够地研究脚本人物性格；而较多地把精力放在分镜头上面了。在摄制过程中又未能照顾到围绕着每个镜头及每一场面的环境，比如“地堡”一场就没能很好地联系外面的战斗情况，而造成了很不合理的现象。假如说这部片子不是由一个人来自编自导的话，那么导演接到剧本后，按剧本的基础来说，还可以搞得更好一些。现在没有这样，原因编导同是一个人，导演已被剧本的故事套住了他自己，不易发挥出新的东西出来；所以在一些主要场面上，未能发挥应有的笔墨，只是平平淡淡地叙述下来，只告诉观众一个故事大略，不够生动，未能表现细节及其内在情感。也就是说未能做到“精雕细刻”。比如，人民解放军追击匪军打下抢走的粮食，王大和替老头扛回来的场面，很多人都受了感动；但这种感动主要是老头的演技所起的作用而不是导演给予观众的。又如挖工事的场面，这个场面主要并不是介绍战争的规模，而是描写老头如何被抓去挖战壕及同样被抓去的老百姓如何劳累，流血流汗，挨打受骂，应当更深一层地刻画出国民党的凶恶残暴及老百姓的激愤。但这个场面使人感到的是一个概念，仅仅是挖战壕的轮廓，没有什么地方使人刺激的了不起。全片看后较为平淡，是与主题不集中有关，但也是未能在现有分量上更进一步发挥的缘故。在若干地方上是有着可以提高的余地的。主要的关键在于：一方面在创作上应该去掉怕出偏差的思想顾虑，突破狭隘现实的约束，细心地分析和综合现实，抓住典型，大胆地进行创作；另一方面要克服突击性质的“大刀阔斧、粗枝大叶”，发挥“细心钻研，精雕细刻”的作风，从思想上很好地“从乡村转向城市”，惟有这样，才能创造出新时代的新主题和新人物，才能使我们获得更优秀的作品。
　　丙、演员及各技术部门
    演员——表演的很不错，大家第一次上银幕，就能获得这样的成绩——演的都很称职。其中苏里（饰匪连长）演的比较自然；解放战士王大和演的很紧张，但不油滑；这是好的，这种角色很容易演的油滑了；大刚、老头、班长都称职，小孩还不错。缺点是：一般演技多是舞台上的东西，给人以不太自然的感觉；台词起初快，纠正后做到了慢而轻，但又由于没有电影经验，限制了情感的发挥，显得生硬。
    摄影——内景拍的很清楚，助手在跟焦点方面做的也不错。但夜景，对光的掌握不够，第一场没能达到想象的效果。一方面是由于天气不好，前后共换用了四种不同的胶片，另一方面也是技术水平不高所致。今后应与洗印方面取得紧密联系，很好地掌握感光度和光圈，并应注意构图，在群众能看得懂的原则下尽量做到“美”。
    录音——做到了使人听得清楚博得了好评。但是，这里有一个经验：在厂内放映时，音量较好，拿到影院去放映时，就显得不够响；今后应研究如何使音响适于影院放映。此外，由于导演的计划不够，在音乐与音响的有无和互相配合上发生了一些毛病。演员没有电影训练，读词快而不清，后来虽然渐有进步，但事前没有很好地选择演员的音色，有些台词发了“赤”音，这是演员读词时的齿音所致。其次因洗声带片用的水不清，留下了很多痕迹，产生了一些杂音，这是值得洗印方面注意改进的。
    美工——基本上实现了导演的意图，也酿成了必要的气氛，如“地堡”，“吴家坏房”，“吴家院子”等气氛都很浓。背景富于真实感，统一了背景与前景的感触。但由于经验关系，没能与照明取紧密联系，如“吴家坏房”的色调太灰，今后应研究色调通过胶片后所产生的效果，加以改进。道具方面一般地完成了任务，但不够饱满。整个地看，还有粗糙的毛病，比如“吴家好房”的泥掉了，“匪军住室”的效果大硬等缺点。
    照明——整个来看很好，有几场夜景——“工事间”、“烧香”、“在坏房里睡觉”、“院景”等都能看得清楚，有气氛。缺点是：有几场不太好，如“吴家好房”的夜景太亮，对灯光的掌握较差，“匪军”的两场夜景气氛不够，但换了几次不同的胶片，也增加了照明的困难。照明技师陈田同志在几次看“素材片”之后所发觉的“ＮＧ”中都主动地检讨了灯光的缺点，并且虚心接受意见，克服了开始时夜景太亮太平的缺点，这种用科学的态度在现有基础上力求改进技术的热情是值得表扬的。今后主要的是：要大胆加强灯光的艺术性。
　　丁、合作关系
    导演及党的支书自开拍以来，即将发扬民主作风与发挥集体力量的精神贯彻到工作中去；并及时利用会议生活，逐步地克服了缺点。属于行政方面的会议计有：一个工作开始时的动员会和结束时的总结会；由各部门负责人参加的技术联席会；按照具体情况随时召开的工作检讨会。
    一、技术联席会——是贯彻群众路线和集体主义精神；事前征求大家意见，想办法——临场时在集中领导统一意志下进行工作的群众性组织。首先由导演根据大家讨论后制订的工作计划（一周订一次）向各小组长布置具体工作，各小组长执行后再向导演汇报，大家互相碰头，一俟条件成熟便召开技术联席会议，讨论剧本内容，导演意图和导演与摄影师、剧务共同商讨下初步制订的分镜头顺序以及开麦拉、录音机、灯光等位置，画成平面平图，使大家都了解自己如何进行工作。然后再由各小组长分头召开各技术部门的小组会议（个别小组还做得不够经常）传达技术联席会的讨论事项和决定，征求全体同志的意见（如有意见立刻向导演反映）和具体布置小组工作。这样，导演的意图和具体的工作顺序、方法等，就从导演那里，一直贯彻到最下层来；到现场后第一个镜头拍完，无须再说，立刻又摆好第二个镜头的位置。在每次实拍前又利用其他小组进行准备工作的时间，由导演以舞台戏的形式帮助演员进行总排，然后再按分镜头顺序和各个技术部门一起进行排练。这之间摄影和录音等均到场进行观察，以便考验分镜头是否得当。之后由导演做最后决定与大家商讨，如无困难，便集中地进行实拍。所指的片子印出“素材片”，经大家看过之后，立刻又由小组会研讨，汇报到联席会进行研究，吸取经验教训。这里解决了一个思想问题；大家不以为这是导演一个人的事，而是大家有责的集体工作。大家都从搞好工作出发，积极提意见，即使在技术上有争执，但又都很虚心，经导演统一集中后，大多数同志都能从思想上服从；并在具体行动上，除开始阶段个别部门互助有些意见外，从未产生过互相不帮助的现象。同时，导演本身也虚心接受大家意见向大家学习；例如开拍的初期，导演帮助演员排剧，和摄影师确定角度后，忽略了声音是否合适，而录音师又是刚参加革命，对革命队伍的上下关系还不摸底，他就想：“过去在旧社会的制片厂里，录音师哪能向导演提意见；导演怎末说，咱就怎么干吧；明知声音不好，破罐子破摔吧！”就一个星期没有吱声，后来他看到导演和大家虚心的工作态度及录音小组其他同志的帮助，终于向导演提出了自己的意见，导演鼓励他说：“你这个意见很好，早就该提，我头一次搞艺术片没有经验，以后只要对工作有好处，不管大小意见尽管提。”从那，导演也注意了声音，录音师也说：“变调器虽然老点，那咱们干这行的，为什么不尽可能搞好点呢！”终于克服了困难，很好地完成了任务。
    二、团结互助——导演与党支书深入群众，在劳动中甚至亲自动手，及时发现和解决问题，发扬了团结互助的作风。比如开拍当初，美工组认为应由照明组绑灯架，照明组认为应由美工组搞，大家谁都不愿管。后来导演及党的支书就及时深入动员大家团结互助，军大同志更积极地帮助合泥，搬砖，搭地堡，有一次不到一夜就拆搭了两个布景；绝大多数同志或帮助抬灯架，或抱反光镜，都发挥了互助的积极性。美工组和照明组终于互相做了自我检讨，再不互相推诿，全体同志并将这种优良的作风一直贯彻到底。
    总之，大家都能从搞好工作出发，通过及时与诚恳的批评与自我批评，从思想上做到了亲密团结，互助合作。
　　戊、关于成绩的估计及其原因
    以大家都是新手的尺度来衡量这部出品，可以说它是在相当水准以上的。导演过去搞部队工作，来厂未到两年，只拍过一部记录片——“东影保育院”，此次做为学习并从保证生产出发，编导了这部片子，并领导大家不断克服种种困难，收到这样成绩，是很难得和很可贵的；演员第一次上银幕，就能获得这样成绩，很不容易；摄影、美工等也是新手，此片的技术水平并不下于其他出品多少，甚至比某些片子还要好些。
    但，这一工作的完成，主要是表现在组织领导的成绩多过在艺术上的成绩，其原因：
    一、是由于导演者有着优良的组织领导能力，党的支书朱革同志说：“导演能冷静果断处理问题，虚心地听取大家意见，所以大家对工作特别放心。”从这句话里便可见到导演支持和组织领导这一工作是有着一定的相当正确的基本态度与方法的。
    二、是党支部起了骨干作用，因而能推动工作，使之顺利地完成。党员也都起了带头作用，大家在难苦的生活里，才毫无怨言地埋头工作，否则这是不可能的。
    三、是全体同志们进步的表现，别的摄制组也有党的支部和党员，为什么合作关系还搞的不够好呢？这个责任要大家来负。而这个组大家能够很好地合作，使工作不遭受损失，这是大家对工作、对厂负责的结果，也就是进步的表现。
    四、是军大同志们的作风和工作态度给了我们一个有力的推动。他们在政治上、在组织观念上、在负责的态度上都影响和推动了我们的进步，我们非常感谢他们。
　　己、主要的经验教训
    培养电影干部并不是那样神秘或困难的，导演第一主要的是他能掌握思想内容；把握了内容之后循着一般的电影法规，往前摸索，一样可以发展到一定的技术水平的。从另一面看来，新导演受旧技术形式的束缚比较少，故此新导演在今后的片子上，当根据这一次的实际经验，提出不论在艺术上、技术上、在组织领导上，更加多的新的创造来，贡献给我们新的电影事业。
