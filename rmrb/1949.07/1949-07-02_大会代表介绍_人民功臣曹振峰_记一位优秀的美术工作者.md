　　Introduction to Delegates to the Congress
  　People's Hero Cao Zhenfeng
  　A Record of an Outstanding Art Worker
    Jin Xi
    Comrade Cao Zhenfeng is a young cadre who grew up in the revolutionary army and is a beloved art worker for the soldiers. He is only twenty-four years old this year; he joined the revolution at the age of thirteen and has been engaged in army art work for more than ten years. He has never attended an art school, but this has not prevented him from becoming an outstanding art worker; this is mainly due to his own continuous study and the Party's cultivation of him.
    He was born into a poor family in Baoding. He loved to draw when he was in elementary school and often exchanged his drawings for paper and ink from his classmates to supplement his learning materials. He lost his schooling after only completing junior primary school due to the "Marco Polo Bridge Incident" when he was only twelve years old. The following year, he joined the propaganda team (i.e., the Frontline Theater Troupe) of the First Independent Division led by General Yang Chengwu, initially as a member of the dance team.
    Because of his special love for painting, he was soon transferred to the painting team. Although he was young at the time, he had great ambitions, exploring and producing village newsletters and large picture newspapers, which were very popular with the masses. At this time, the propaganda section also began to pay attention to this young painter. Every week, his paintings were posted in the club and on the playground. Although his skills were not yet mature, they had become an indispensable part of the soldiers' spiritual food. He won first place in the art competition held in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region on its second anniversary; he was only fourteen years old at the time. In 1940, he founded the "Frontline Pictorial" (mimeographed), painting, editing, carving, and printing it himself. In addition, he often painted for local areas and companies and decorated venues, producing dozens of paintings every day. This cultivated his work attitude of subordinating to political needs and not dwelling on personal skill improvement. Even so, it did not prevent his rapid progress in skills.
    Since the War of Liberation, he has not only painted a large number of comic strips, news reportage paintings, and propaganda materials, but also used great efforts to develop the army's art movement. He held short-term art training classes or inserted art courses into cultural and educational training classes, compiling and lecturing while training a large number of painting talents. These people played a great role in mobilizing the troops during marches and battles. They were the editors of "marching small newspapers" and "combat small newspapers," as well as correspondents for the army and division pictorials. When fighting in new areas, they were also good policy propagandists. When marching towards Chahar South, he also organized a mural movement, painting every village he passed through. The walls of the villages he passed through were filled with paintings, which had a very good effect.
    In these more than ten years of art activities, Comrade Cao Zhenfeng has created major comic strip albums such as "Kill Hitler," "The Mask of the Japanese寇," "Five Warriors," "Soldiers of the People," "Li Yong," "San'er Escapes Danger," "An Ordinary Story," "Red Valley Rice," "The Story of Ge Cun," "Heroes' Gathering," "Nearsightedness Makes Mistakes," "Favor," "On the Road of Peace and Democracy," "The Final Mobilization and the Final Judgment," "Fierce Battle with Tanks," "Lu Lianyu," "Water," and "The Secret in the Cabinet." "Five Warriors," created in 1941, won the Lu Xun Literary Prize.
    After studying at the United University in early 1942, he briefly created based on imagination, but the "Li Yong" he painted did not resemble the real Li Yong. He began to doubt this creative method and resolved to study hard among the masses. When the enemy bloodbathed Langya Mountain in May of that year, he began to overcome the creative method of replacing reality with imagination, going to reality to find real people, and created "Li Migui." In the second half of the year, under intense ideological struggle, he went to approach the "soldiers." From then on, he knew that as long as he was willing to be a primary school student, the "soldiers" were easy to approach. He began to become the best comrade-in-arms of the "soldiers." During the Linquan battle in 1943, he published a pictorial depicting the battle according to the requirements of the soldiers. Since the War of Liberation, he has devoted all his energy to painting "soldiers," excellently combining art and war.
    The reason why his paintings are welcomed by the masses is because he went deep into the company like a soldier, interviewing and sketching under the continuous artillery fire to obtain materials, finding a hidden place to take out the steel plate and carve. After carving, he handed it to the cavalry communication officer to send it to the brigade for printing. Sometimes, small troops did not have mimeographs, and they did not rest after the battle, but took the carved wax paper to the county government for printing, and then distributed it to the troops. During the Huailai battle in September 1946, enemy planes bombed all day long, collapsing the entrance to the basement where he carved the newspaper, overturning the table, and damaging the wax paper. He still insisted on publishing, completing the first issue of the "Combat Pictorial" after three attempts.
    Comrade Cao Zhenfeng has a clear class stand and never cares about personal enjoyment. He said: "The more difficult life is, the clearer you can see things, and the less likely material problems are to corrode your class ideology." At the same time, the simpler his life is, the more willing the soldiers are to approach him. He worked very hard. In order to publish in a timely manner, he always carried a steel plate, a roll of wax paper, an iron pen, and a roller on his back. Wherever the company went, he went. The top of the mountain, the rocks, the cowshed, and the stone cave were all his studios and printing houses. Because of this, often on the night of the general attack, the handwriting of our propagandists appeared in the hands of the soldiers. The ink was not yet dry.
    A regimental political commissar said: "Comrade Cao Zhenfeng has the most mass viewpoint."
    Therefore, he was credited twice—once with a major credit and once with an ordinary credit.
    Comrade Cao Zhenfeng strives to transform himself into a "soldier," so he can paint soldiers with flesh and blood. Comrade Cao Zhenfeng also moved this work from the room to the front line, making it directly serve the war, and launched an art movement in the company, making it the soldiers' own art. His work achievements today provide the best example for our army art workers.

　　大会代表介绍
  　人民功臣曹振峰
  　记一位优秀的美术工作者
    靳夕
    曹振峰同志是在革命部队里长大的青年干部，是战士们最爱戴的艺术工作者。他今年才二十四岁；十三岁参加革命，而从事部队美术工作就有十年多了。他没有进过美术学校，可是这并没有妨害他成为一个优秀的艺术工作者；这主要是由于他自己不停地钻研和党对他的培养。
    他生于保定一个贫民的家庭，在小学校时就爱画画，常常以自己的画换取同学们的纸张笔墨，以补充自己的学习用具。刚刚念完初小，就发生了“芦沟桥事变”，因此而失学，那时才十二岁。隔年他就参加了杨成武将军所率领独一师的宣传队（即战线剧社）起初是舞蹈队的队员。
    由于他对绘画有特殊的爱好，不久就被调到画画队。那时年岁虽小，志向却不小，自己摸索着出老乡报和大张画报，很受群众欢迎。这时宣传科也开始注视这位小画家，俱乐部里，操场上，每星期都有他的画贴在那里，虽然技巧还不成熟，可是已经成为战士们精神食粮中必不可缺的东西了。在晋察冀边区创立二周年的美术比赛时，他获得了第一名，那时他才十四岁。一九四○年创办“战线画报”（油印的），自画、自编、自刻、自印，此外还经常给地方上、连队里画画和布置会场，每天都要画出几十幅画，这养成了他在工作态度上的服从政治需要，而不斤斤计较于个人的技巧提高，虽然如此，也没有阻止了他在技巧上的突飞猛进。
    解放战争以来，他不仅画了大量的连环画、新闻报导画和宣传品，还用了很大的力量来开展部队的美术运动。举办短期美术训练班，或在文教训练班上插进美术课程，随编，随讲，培养了大批的绘画人材，这些人在连队行军作战中，是起了很大鼓动作用的。他们是“行军小报”，“战斗小报”的编者，同时也是军、师画报的通讯员，在新区作战时，又是很好的政策宣传者，在向察南进军时，他还组织了壁画运动，到一村画一村，所经各村墙上都画满了画，曾收到很好的效果。
    这十年多的美术活动中曹振峰同志创作了“打杀希特勒”、“日寇的假面具”、“五勇士”、“子弟兵”、“李勇”、“三儿脱险记”、“平常的故事”、“红谷米”、“葛存的故事”、“英雄集会”、“近视眼犯错误”、“恩惠”、“在和平民主的道路上”、“最后的动员与最后的审判”、“鏖战坦克”、“芦连玉”、“水”、“柜子里的秘密”等主要的连环画册。一九四一年创作的“五勇士”曾荣获鲁迅文艺奖金。
    一九四二年初从联大学习出来曾有一个短时期凭想象去创作，但“李勇”画出来不象真实的李勇，始对这种创作方法发生怀疑，乃决心到群众中去刻苦学习。该年五月敌人血洗狼牙山的时候，他开始克服以想象代替真实的创作方法，到实际中去寻找真的人物，创作了“李米贵”，下半年在激烈的思想斗争下又去接近“兵”，从此知道，只要自己甘当小学生，“兵”原是好接近的，他开始成为“兵”的最好战友。四三年林泉战斗中，根据战士的要求，出版了描写战斗的画报。解放战争以来他全部力量都用在画“兵”上面，出色的做到了美术与战争的结合。
    他的画之所以为群众欢迎，是因为他跟一个兵一样的深入了连队，在连天的炮火下面去采访、素描，取得了素材，找一个隐蔽的地方拿出钢板来刻，刻好交骑兵通讯员送到旅里去印刷，有时小部队行动没有油印机，战斗以后也不休息，拿刻好的腊纸去找县政府印刷，回来发给部队。四六年九月怀来战斗时敌机整天轰炸不停，把他刻画报的地下室门口炸塌了，桌子震翻了，腊纸也压坏了，他仍然坚持着出版，前后三次才完成了第一期“战斗画报”。
    曹振峰同志有明确的阶级立场，向不计较个人的生活享受，他说：“生活越艰苦就越能看清事务，更不会使物质问题来腐蚀自己的阶级思想”。同时他的生活越朴素，战士越愿意接近他。他很刻苦的工作着，为了及时出版，他总是背着一块钢板、一筒腊纸、一支铁笔和一个滚子，连队走到哪里他也走到哪里，山顶上、石头上、牛棚里、石洞里都是他的画室和印刷所，正因为这样，常常在总攻的那天晚上，在战士的手上出现了，我们鼓动者的笔迹。油墨还没有干呢。
    有一位团政委说：“曹振峰同志是最有群众观点的。”
    因此，他立了两次功——一个大功，和一个普通功。
    曹振峰同志努力使自己变成为一个“兵”，所以才画出有血有肉的兵来，曹振峰同志又把这一工作由房间里推到火线上去，使它直接为战争服务，并在连队中开展美术运动，使它成为战士们自己的艺术，他今天的工作成就，给我们部队美术工作者作了最好的榜样。
