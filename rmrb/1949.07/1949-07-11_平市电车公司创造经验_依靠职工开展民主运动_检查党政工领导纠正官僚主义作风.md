　　Beijing Tram Company Creates Experience
  　Relying on Employees to Carry Out Democratic Movement
    Inspecting Party, Government, and Labor Union Leaders to Correct Bureaucratic Work Style
    [Report from this newspaper] After a temporary employee representative meeting, the Beijing Tram Company reviewed the phenomenon of the Party branch, company administration, and labor union detaching from the masses and their bureaucratic work style. This improved the relationship between the Party and the masses, strengthened employee unity, and laid a preliminary foundation for the establishment of a company management committee and the implementation of democratic enterprise management. After the liberation of Beijing, under the leadership of the Party, government, and labor union, the company's employees launched a competition and made many achievements. However, due to the bureaucratic work style of the administration, branch, and labor union leadership detaching from the masses, many important measures failed to penetrate the masses and absorb workers' opinions, so many problems that should have been dealt with were not handled in a timely manner. For example, the personnel and organizational issues that workers urgently demanded to be resolved were never well addressed. Furthermore, due to a lack of scientific working methods and democratic management, work lacked planning and focus. The takeover team cadres each acted independently, which led to relaxed leadership in the vehicle repair campaign, allowing it to become uncontrolled, and negligence, resulting in the South Factory fire. Xu Bu-ning, the general branch secretary, only consulted with a few Party members and activists. Many Party members also held "meritorious" thoughts, only discussing matters with higher-ups and rarely researching with or reporting to non-Party committee members within the labor union, causing misunderstandings and dissatisfaction among the non-Party labor union committee members, which led to serious disunity within the labor union. Seven or eight committee members were detached from production, "working" in the labor union, but when workers had issues and went to the labor union, the committee members shirked responsibility. The medical clinic that workers urgently demanded was never established, and the issues of cleaning up the old cooperative and children of employees entering schools were delayed for a long time without resolution, causing worker dissatisfaction.
    The above situation became a major obstacle to the establishment of a company management committee and the development of production. Recently, with the assistance of higher-level Party, government, and labor union cadres, the examination of the relationship between the Party and the masses began first in the Party branch. Non-Party labor union committee members were invited to attend and participate, engaging in criticism and self-criticism, and humbly accepting criticism from non-Party members. This changed the non-Party labor union committee members' negative impression of the Communist Party branch of the tram company, making them realize that the branch was a leading organization for educating Party members, examining themselves, uniting the masses, and developing production, which greatly moved them. Subsequently, the company administration and labor union also convened cadre meetings, based on the opinions of the workers, and conducted relatively profound criticisms and self-criticisms of the work situation, the relationship between the Party and the masses, the relationship between staff and workers, and personal work styles. Everyone unanimously expressed their desire to change their past work styles, strengthen unity, and wholeheartedly serve all employees.
    In order to further mobilize the masses and examine leadership, it was also decided to convene a temporary employee representative assembly to carry out a democratic movement. In advance, labor union committee members conducted propaganda and mobilization separately, and 80 percent of the workers participated in the election, electing a total of fifty-nine representatives. On the first day of the assembly, the administrative and labor union work reports and the self-criticisms of the cadres were heard, and the cadres admitted their mistakes to everyone, sincerely requesting everyone to put forward criticisms and suggestions for improvement on the work and on individuals. Seeing the cadres' humble attitude and that the representatives could truly represent the workers' opinions, the workers actively put forward their own opinions. During the two or three days of the meeting, the representatives spoke extensively, criticizing the leadership, and even more so, putting forward active and constructive suggestions. In terms of Party members' thinking, due to insufficient preparation beforehand, there was a temporary display of confusion and unease. However, after conducting education through timely branch meetings, they further realized the seriousness of their past detachment from the masses, and also realized that all of the workers' opinions came from caring for the Party, caring for the administration and labor union, which greatly encouraged them.
    During the temporary representative assembly, the representatives and workers maintained a relatively close connection. The representatives used the spare time before and after the workers went to and from work to convey the progress of the assembly separately, and continued to solicit workers' opinions. Therefore, the temporary representative assembly gained the concern and support of most of the workers, who sent congratulatory messages to the assembly. At the same time, however, some radical thoughts and vague understandings also occurred among the masses and representatives, such as extreme democratic ideas such as thinking that trainees should also be elected. After the presidium and higher-level Party, government, and labor union cadres explained in a timely manner, many problems were solved ideologically.
    Seventy percent of the proposals of the temporary representative assembly were constructive suggestions, and there was no excessive harshness on personal shortcomings, because the workers already understood that only by doing a good job in the company, improving business, and developing production could they improve their own lives. Among the representatives, struggles were also carried out against incorrect opinions at any time. For example, when discussing the personnel director, Li Tian-duo, who colluded with Kuomintang military police to suppress workers' resistance, his son, Li Lei (a representative), stood up to defend him, and everyone immediately launched a serious criticism against him. The assembly discussed the personnel issue, and then divided into several specialized groups such as wages, welfare, and company management to conduct research, initially proposing implementation plans, and then discussing and supplementing them by the assembly, handing them over to the presidium. However, the discussion of production work was neglected, which was a major shortcoming.
    On the last day of the assembly, after the administrative, labor union, and department heads answered the representatives' questions, they made summary reports to the assembly separately, explaining that they accepted the assembly's suggestions, would handle the personnel issues separately according to their severity, would carry out appropriate reforms to the organizational structure, would determine various systems, would formulate production plans, would inventory the company's assets, would adjust the wage system, and would submit worker welfare and sanitation equipment, etc., to the company management committee, which would be established soon, for research and discussion, to determine a plan, and to implement it concretely. In the implementation, they would solicit workers' opinions and rely on the working class to democratically manage the company at any time. Next, all the labor union committee members collectively swore an oath to the assembly, guaranteeing unity. All the representatives also shouted, "Love the company!" "Love the labor union!"

　　平市电车公司创造经验
  　依靠职工开展民主运动
    检查党政工领导纠正官僚主义作风
    【本报讯】北平电车公司经过临时职工代表会，检讨了公司中党的支部、公司行政与职工会的脱离群众现象和官僚主义作风，改善了党与群众关系，加强了职工团结，为建立公司管理委员会和实行企业管理民主化打下了初步的基础。该公司职工在北平解放后，曾在党政工领导下，掀起竞赛，做出许多成绩。但因行政与支部、工会领导上存在着脱离群众的官僚主义作风，在许多重要的措施上未能深入群众，吸收工人意见，使许多应处理的问题未能及时处理。如工人迫切要求解决的人事与机构问题，始终未能很好解决。更由于缺乏科学的工作方法与民主的管理，工作无计划无中心，接管组干部各自为政，以致在修车运动中放松领导，形成自流，疏忽麻痹，发生了南厂火警。总支书许步宁做事只和几个党员和积极分子商量，而党员又多存在着“功臣”思想，遇事只与上级商议，很少和工会内的非党委员研究，或向他们报告，引起非党工会委员的误会与不满，造成职工会内部严重的不团结。七八个委员脱离生产，坐在职工会里“办公”，但工人有事找到职工会，委员们却互相推诿不负责任。工人们迫切要求的医疗所始终未能建立，旧合作社的清理与员工子弟入学问题也长期拖延没解决，造成工人不满。
    以上情形，成为建立公司管理委员会与发展生产的重大障碍。最近经上级党政工干部的协助，首先在党的支部中开始检查党与群众关系，并请非党工会委员列席参加，展开批评与自我批评，并虚心接受非党员的批评；这使非党工会委员改变了对电车公司的共产党支部的不良印象，认识支部是教育党员、检讨自己、团结群众、发展生产的领导组织，使他们受到了很大的感动。接着公司行政和职工会也先后召开了干部会，根据工人的意见，对工作情况，党与群众关系、职员与工人关系、个人作风都作了比较深刻的批评与自我批评。大家一致表示要改变过去作风，加强团结，全心全意为全体职工服务。
    为一进步发动群众，检查领导，又决定召开临时职工代表大会，开展民主运动。事前由工会委员分头进行宣传动员，有百分之八十的工人都参加了选举，共选出代表五十九人。大会的第一天即听取了行政与工会的工作报告与干部的自我检讨，向大家承认错误，并城恳要求大家对工作对个人提出批评与改进意见。工人们看到干部这种虚心态度与代表们真能代表工人意见，于是纷纷提出自己意见。在两三天的会议上，代表们广泛发言，对领导提出了批评，更多的是提出了积极的建设性的意见。在党员思想上，因事先准备不够充分，曾表现了一时的泥乱与不安。但经随时召开支部会进行教育，他们进一步认识了过去脱离群众的严重性，同时也认识了工人一切意见皆从爱护党、爱护行政与工会出发，也给了他们很大鼓舞。
    在临代会期间，代表和工人之间，经常保持了比较密切的联系，代表们利用工人上下班前后的空余时间，分别传达大会进行情况，并继续征求工人意见，因此临代会获得了大部分工人的关怀与拥护，纷纷向大会献词祝贺。但同时，在群众和代表中也曾发生了一些偏激的思想和迷糊的认识，如认为受训学员也要选举等极端民主思想等。经过主席团和上级党政工干部随时解释，在思想上解决了不少问题。
    临代会的提案中，百分之七十都是建设性的意见，对个人缺点并无过分的苛责，因为工人已经懂得，只有将公司搞好，改进业务，发展生产，才能改善自己的生活。在代表们相互间，也随时对不正确的意见进行了斗争。如讨论勾结国民党军警镇压工人反抗的人事处长李天铎时，他的儿子李蕾（代表）曾起立辩护，大家立即对他展开了严正的批评。大会讨论了人事问题，又分成工资、福利、公司管理等几个专门小组，进行研究，初步提出实施方案，然后由大会讨论补充，交与主席团。但却忽视了对于生产工作的讨论，这是一个最大的缺点。
    大会的最后一天，由行政、工会及各部负责干部解答代表们的质问后，即分别向大会做总结报告，说明接受大会的建议，对人事问题要分别轻重进行处理，对组织机构要进行适当的改革，确定各种制度，制订生产计划，清点公司财产，调整工资制度，工人福利以及卫生设备等，均将提交不久即将成立的公司管理委员会研究讨论，定出计划，具体执行。在执行中，当随时征求工人意见，依靠工人阶级，民主管理公司。接着，全体工会委员集体向大会宣誓，保证团结。全体代表也高呼：“爱护公司”！“爱护工会！”
