    [Ping City News] On the fifth day (the 6th) of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, all the representatives welcomed Chairman Mao Zedong's attendance for guidance with great excitement and enthusiasm, and listened to Vice-Chairman Zhou Enlai's report. The congress began at 2:00 PM, with A Ying serving as the chairman of the congress. Vice-Chairman Zhou's report was divided into two parts: the first part vividly described the great achievements of the People's Liberation War over the past three years and the efforts made by the people of the whole country to achieve this achievement; the second part gave detailed instructions on issues such as the unity of literary and art circles, serving the people, popularization and improvement, and reforming old literature and art (full text to be published separately). At 7:20 PM, as Vice-Chairman Zhou was about to conclude his report, the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao, suddenly came to the meeting and appeared on the rostrum. All the representatives stood up to welcome him, applauding warmly and for a long time, and shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" After the venue quieted down, Chairman Mao said to everyone: "Comrades, today I am here to welcome you. The grand meeting you are holding is a very good meeting, a meeting needed by the revolution, a meeting hoped for by the people of the whole country, because you are all people needed by the people, you are people's writers, people's artists, or organizers of people's literary and art workers. You are beneficial to the revolution and beneficial to the people. Because the people need you, we have reason to welcome you. Let me say again, we welcome you." After Chairman Mao finished speaking, all the representatives responded with prolonged and enthusiastic applause and cheers. Finally, Guo Moruo, the chairman of the congress, excitedly said on behalf of everyone: "We sincerely and fully accept the instructions given to us by Vice-Chairman Zhou, strive to transform ourselves, learn from the people, learn what we are not familiar with, learn honestly and respectfully, and enthusiastically become students of Chairman Mao." After he finished speaking, he led everyone to shout slogans. The congress continued until around 8:00 PM in the evening before it adjourned.
