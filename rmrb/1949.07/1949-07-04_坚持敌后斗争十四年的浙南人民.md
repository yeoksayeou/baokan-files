　　The People of Southern Zhejiang Persist in Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines for Fourteen Years
　　Yin Xue

　　After the People's Liberation Army's million-strong field army crossed the Yangtze River on its southern expedition, on May 6th, the People's Liberation Army Southern Zhejiang Guerrilla Column, with the cooperation of over 100,000 militiamen, launched a fierce offensive against the strongholds of the Kuomintang bandit gangs in Southern Zhejiang to respond to the field army's operations. On the 7th, it liberated Wenzhou, an important commercial port in Southern Zhejiang, completely annihilated the enemy who refused to surrender, and won over Ye Fen, the Kuomintang commissioner of Wenzhou, to lead two regiments and the Yongjia Self-Defense Brigade in an uprising. Subsequently, within six days, it victoriously liberated more than ten county towns including Ruian, Pingyang, Qingtian, Taishun, Yuhuan, Yueqing, Wencheng, Jingning, Wenling, and Huangyan, completely liberating Southern Zhejiang.

　　On this victorious day, the people of Southern Zhejiang will never forget how, in the difficult environment of the past fourteen years, they struggled arduously under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party against the Kuomintang reactionaries and Japanese imperialists, and tempered and strengthened their own forces.

　　In April 1934, after the vanguard of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the Advance Column, organized by Comrades Su Yu and Liu Ying, entered the Zhejiang-Fujian border area, the flames of revolution began to burn in Zhejiang and Fujian. At that time, Kuomintang military leaders Luo Zhuoying, Zhang Fakui, Liu Jianxu, and Li Jue commanded 100,000 troops, attempting to wipe out this people's force in one fell swoop, but two "encirclement and suppression" campaigns were bravely crushed by the people of Southern Zhejiang. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, this people's armed force, under the leadership of General Su Yu, was incorporated into the New Fourth Army and went to the front lines of the war. The people of Southern Zhejiang, under the leadership of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee and Provincial Committee Secretary Comrade Liu Ying, launched a vigorous anti-Japanese national salvation movement, organized broad masses of people, and established anti-Japanese cadre schools. However, under the Kuomintang reactionaries' reactionary policy of passively resisting Japan and actively opposing communism and the people, they continued to persecute the patriotic people of Southern Zhejiang. After 1938, the environment in Southern Zhejiang became extremely difficult, and hundreds and thousands of Communist Party members and patriotic people were brutally murdered and persecuted. From 1940 to 1945, the Kuomintang reactionaries frequently concentrated four security regiments and two regular divisions to carry out so-called "clearing," "encirclement and suppression," and "stationing and suppression" campaigns against the people's armed forces in Southern Zhejiang, implementing policies of population relocation and village consolidation, and the "Three Alls" policy (kill all, burn all, loot all). During this period, more than 10,000 CPC members, cadres, and patriotic people in Southern Zhejiang were arrested, and more than 3,000 were massacred. The arrested patriotic people and CPC members in Southern Zhejiang suffered all kinds of horrific tortures at the hands of the bandits. After two female Communist Party members from Dinding County and Beigang, Pingyang County, were arrested, the Kuomintang reactionaries stripped off their clothes and burned them with raging fire. After Comrade Chen Baigong, the CPC County Committee Secretary of Dinding, was arrested, he was stripped of his clothes, and his flesh was cut off piece by piece with scissors, but Comrade Chen Baigong remained steadfast and unyielding, and finally shouted, "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" and died a heroic death. Comrade Liu Ying, Secretary of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee, was also unfortunately arrested by the Kuomintang reactionaries in Wenzhou in 1942 and died a heroic death.

　　However, the people of Southern Zhejiang never succumbed. Many CPC members, cadres, and patriotic people, under the leadership of Comrade Long Yue (former Secretary of the CPC Southern Zhejiang Prefectural Committee, currently a member of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee and Secretary of the Fifth Prefectural Committee), slept in mountain gullies and lived in wild caves. They had no cotton clothes in winter and often went without food, persisting in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. In 1942, when the Japanese invaders occupied Wenzhou, the people on both sides of the Ou River, under the leadership of the CPC, established the Yong (jia) Le (qing) People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Column, which grew from two pistols and four rifles to an armed force of more than 400 people. In the joint attack of the Kuomintang and Japanese invaders, they protected the vast areas north and south of the Ou River from enemy ravages. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionaries in Southern Zhejiang became even more fanatical in their anti-communism. The Party and people's armed forces in Southern Zhejiang first launched a rectification movement within the Party, strengthened ideological education, overcame peaceful illusions, corrected the bad tendencies of some cadres, strengthened Party unity, and further launched the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. Encouraged by the continuous victories of the main force of the National Liberation Army, especially after the victories of our field army's spring and autumn offensives last year, the people's armed forces in Southern Zhejiang rapidly developed and grew stronger. Armed construction was carried out in a planned manner in various places, cadres were actively trained, new areas were opened up, the combat effectiveness of the troops was increasingly strengthened, and mass organizations such as peasant associations, peasant self-defense forces, and women's federations were established in many places. On December 15th last year, the Southern Zhejiang Guerrilla Column was established, and under the command of Commander and Political Commissar Long Yue, it universally destroyed the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the countryside, concentrated its forces to take the initiative to attack, and forced the Kuomintang bandit troops to shrink into the cities and dare not come out. Since then, a new situation has emerged in Southern Zhejiang. In February of this year, in the Taishun Campaign, the Southern Zhejiang Guerrilla Column completely annihilated the entire 3rd Battalion of the reinforced puppet Zhejiang Security 2nd Regiment, seizing two 60 mortars, thirteen light and heavy machine guns, and more than 200 long and short guns, and once liberated Taishun County. Subsequently, Yuhuan County was also liberated, the puppet county magistrate was captured alive, and enemy strongholds such as Hongqiao, Fenglin, Shanxi, and Tangling around Yueqing were removed. By this time, the vast majority of the rural areas of Southern Zhejiang had been liberated, peasant associations and women's federations had been universally established in various places, and there were more than 100,000 peasant self-defense team members.

　　On May 5th of this year, the Southern Zhejiang Guerrilla Column finally victoriously joined forces with the People's Liberation Army field army on its southern expedition on the outskirts of Wenzhou, and the people of Southern Zhejiang celebrated their eternal liberation with jubilation. Now, they, together with the People's Liberation Army field army, are jointly shouldering the task of eliminating the remnants of the bandits in Southern Zhejiang and building a new Southern Zhejiang.

　　坚持敌后斗争十四年的浙南人民
    尹学
    人民解放军百万野战大军渡江南征后，五月六日人民解放军浙南游击纵队便在十万多民兵配合下，向浙南国民党匪帮各据点展开了猛烈攻势，以响应野战大军的作战。七日解放了浙南重要商埠温州，全部歼灭拒绝投降的敌人，并争取了国民党温州专员叶芬率两个团及永嘉自卫总队起义。接着在六天内，又胜利的解放了瑞安、平阳、青田、泰顺、玉环、乐清、文成、景宁、温岭、黄岩等十余座县城，浙南完全解放。
    在这胜利的日子里，浙南人民永远也不会忘记，在过去十四年艰苦的环境里，他们是怎样在中国共产党领导下，与国民党反动派和日本帝国主义者进行着长期的、艰苦的斗争，锻炼和壮大着自己的力量。
    一九三四年四月，中国工农红军北上抗日先遣队组织的挺进师，在粟裕、刘英两同志领导下进入浙闽边区后，革命的烽火开始在浙闽燃烧起来了。当时国民党军头子罗卓英、张发奎、刘建绪、李觉指挥了十万兵力，企图将这支人民队伍一网打尽，但是两次“围剿”都被浙南人民英勇地粉碎了。一九三七年抗日战争爆发后，这支人民武装在粟裕将军率领下编入新四军，开赴抗日前线。浙南人民则在中共浙江省委会和省委书记刘英同志领导下，掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗日救亡运动，组织了广大的群众，举办了抗日干部学校。但是国民党反动派在消极抗战积极反共反人民的反动政策下，继续迫害着浙南爱国人民。一九三八年后，浙南的环境就走上了非常艰苦的局面，成百成千的共产党员和爱国群众，遭到残酷的屠杀和迫害。一九四○年到一九四五年，国民党反动派经常集中四个保安团和两个正规师，对浙南人民武装进行所谓“清剿”、“围剿”、“驻剿”，实施移民并村政策，三光政策等。浙南中共党员、干部和爱国人民在这一时期遭受逮捕的在一万人以上，被屠杀的在三千人以上。被捕的浙南爱国人民和中共党员受尽了匪徒们的各种惨绝人寰的酷刑。鼎平县的和平阳县北港的两个女共产党员被捕后，国民党反动派把她们的衣裤剥下来，用烈火烧。鼎平的中共县委书记陈百弓同志被捕后被剥去衣服，用剪刀一刀刀地饺去身上的肉，但陈百弓同志坚贞不屈，最后高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”壮烈就义。中共浙江省委书记刘英同志也在一九四二年于温州不幸为国民党反动派逮捕而壮烈牺牲。
    但是，浙南人民始终没有屈服，许多中共党员干部和爱国人民在龙跃同志（前中共浙南地委书记，现任中共浙江省委委员兼第五地委书记）的领导下睡山沟，住野洞，冬天没有棉衣，常常吃不到饭，就这样坚持着敌后游击战争。一九四二年，日寇侵占了温州，瓯江两岸人民在中共领导下成立了永（嘉）乐（清）人民抗日游击纵队，从二支短枪，四支长枪，发展到有四百多人的武装。他们在国民党和日寇的联合夹攻中，保护了瓯江南北广大地区免遭敌人的蹂躏。日寇投降后，浙南的国民党反动派愈加疯狂反共。浙南党和人民武装首先在党内展开了整风运动，加强思想教育，克服和平幻想，纠正某些干部的不良倾向，加强党内团结，进一步地展开对国民党反动派的斗争。在全国解放军主力不断胜利的鼓舞下，尤其是在我野战大军去年的春季攻势和秋季攻势胜利后，浙南人民武装迅速发展和壮大起来。各地有计划地进行了武装建设，积极训练干部，开辟新区，部队的战斗力日益坚强，许多地方建立了农民联合会，农民自卫队、妇女联合会等群众组织。去年十二月十五日浙南游击纵队成立，在龙跃司令员兼政治委员的指挥下，普遍地摧毁了国民党反动派在乡村中的统治，集中力量主动出击，迫使国民党匪军缩在城里不敢出来。从此浙南出现了一种新的局面。今年二月间浙南游击纵队在泰顺战役中，彻底地歼灭了增援的伪浙江保安二团第三营全部，缴获六○炮二门、轻重机枪十三挺、长短枪二百余支，一度解放了泰顺县城。接着，又解放了玉环县城，活捉伪县长，拔除了乐清周围的虹桥、枫林、珊溪、塘凌等敌据点。至此，浙南广大乡村绝大部分被解放，各地普遍成立了农民联合会，妇女联合会，并拥有十万以上的农民自卫队员。
    今年五月五日，浙南游击纵队终于与渡江南征的人民解放军野战军在温州外围胜利会师，浙南人民狂欢地庆祝着他们的永远的解放。现在，他们与人民解放军野战军共同负担起了肃清浙南残匪与建设新浙南的任务。
