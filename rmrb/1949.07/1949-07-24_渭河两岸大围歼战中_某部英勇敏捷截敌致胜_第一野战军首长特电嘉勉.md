Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, July 23rd: In the recent battle to encircle and annihilate Hu bandit's four armies on both banks of the Wei River, a certain army of the People's Liberation Army's First Field Army, with a rapid march of over 140 *li* in 14 hours, directly penetrated the enemy's rear. At 6:00 AM on July 12th, it took the strategically important Luo Ju Town on the north bank of the Wei River southwest of Fufeng in one fell swoop. It also bravely and tenaciously repelled more than ten counterattacks launched jointly by Hu bandit's 65th Army and 38th Army, victoriously completing the glorious task of cutting off the enemy's retreat route. Later, with the cooperation of fraternal units, the enemy was completely annihilated on both banks of the Wei River. Following this victory, the unit took advantage of the situation and advanced courageously overnight, recovering Qishan City and Caijiapo Station, and recovering Baoji County in the early morning of the 14th. Before fleeing Baoji, the Hu bandits originally attempted to thoroughly destroy the factories and bridges, and had already installed explosives, but due to the rapid advance of the unit, except for the Wei River Bridge which was destroyed, the rest were preserved and not damaged. The leaders of the First Field Army, considering the army's bravery, agility, and remarkable achievements, sent a special telegram to commend all the officers and soldiers of the unit, urging them to continue their efforts and strive for greater victories.
