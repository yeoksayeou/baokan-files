　　How Did Beiping Municipality Organize Street Vendors?
　　By Our Reporter Chao Qi

　　The work of organizing street vendors in Beiping Municipality has been successfully completed. This is the result of the correct leadership of the Beiping Municipal Committee, the efforts of more than 700 cadres at all levels, and the support of the masses.

　　Street vending in Beiping has a long history. Since the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule caused many people to lose their jobs and turn to street vending for a living, thus becoming a social problem. In addition, at the beginning of Beiping's liberation, we were busy taking over and did not pay attention to this issue. Some seated merchants, in order to evade taxes, broke up their businesses into individual stalls, manipulating the street vendor market, hindering the legitimate business of genuine street vendors and the development of legitimate commerce. There were also a small number of fleeing landlords, scattered soldiers, and secret agents who used street vending as a cover for subversive activities. By the time of the reorganization, there were as many as 45,000 vendors. Most of them were concentrated on major transportation routes, obstructing people and vehicles, which seriously hindered traffic order. In order to protect the legitimate business of the majority of genuine street vendors, to organize traffic order, and to maintain social security, the municipal government accepted the demands of the citizens and decided to concentrate its efforts to reorganize the order of street vendors. At first, the street vendors had some doubts and fears about this reorganization. After Mayor Ye Jianying and Comrade Peng Zhen explained our attitude, principles, and methods of reorganization at a symposium of street vendor representatives on May 23, they unanimously recognized that street vendors must be reorganized and were willing to assist the government in the reorganization. However, after returning, they emphasized on-site reorganization and were unwilling to relocate.

　　At the beginning of the reorganization, some leading cadres in some districts did not deeply understand the policy spirit of reorganizing street vendors, and their thinking was based on a simple urban appearance perspective, or they did not pay enough attention to this work. This caused setbacks in the work. At the same time, some leading cadres in some districts initially listed the reorganization of street vendors as one of the central tasks, mobilizing a large number of capable cadres from the district, street, and public security sub-bureaus to carry out a concentrated effort. They conducted in-depth publicity, convened small-scale street vendor meetings, and listened to their opinions. They discovered activists and carried out registration and organization work. They kept abreast of the overall situation at all times, so that the work could be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. For example, the Twelfth District's reorganization of the Tianqiao street vendors was a typical example. They started by establishing a street vendor reorganization committee, which was divided into publicity and construction groups. The district chief personally led the work. In addition to the construction group, most of the cadres went to the street vendors to carry out focused work. Their specific work steps were as follows: (1) Combining publicity, mobilization, understanding of the situation, and registration. (2) Discovering activists and carrying out organization. (3) Building new markets, marking plots and numbering them, and issuing relocation permits. (4) Relocation. (5) After relocation, establishing a new order and consolidating the new market, etc.

　　At the end of May, in view of the lack of a unified leadership organization in the city, the inconsistent methods and steps in each district caused some street vendors to wander around and evade reorganization. The difficulties encountered in the work in each district were not easily resolved, and deviations could not be quickly corrected. The Municipal Committee, together with the Municipal Government, jointly established a street vendor reorganization headquarters. The Municipal Committee personally took control, broke the boundaries of the districts, unified the organization, and concentrated leadership. It also sent cadres to help the work in each district in a focused manner. Each district reported its work situation to the headquarters every day. All work plans and programs had to be requested before they could be implemented. This was also one of the factors that contributed to the rapid and smooth completion of the work later.

　　Summarizing the experience of this reorganization of street vendors, according to what the reporter has learned, the main points are as follows:

　　(1) Announce the correct policies and principles from the beginning. Although the composition of street vendors is very complex, most of them are poor citizens who rely on street vending for a living. We adopt a policy of protection towards them. Although many of them hinder traffic, we are reorganizing traffic on the condition of helping them solve their difficulties. This is fundamentally different from the Kuomintang's reorganization. However, we resolutely banish a small number of illegal street vendors such as those who are “sticking blood.” Therefore, it won the support of the majority of street vendors. However, when we initially explained that street vendors must pay a certain license tax, because the preparatory work was not done well, we failed to announce the tax amount at the same time, so that street vendors only knew that they should pay taxes but did not know how much they should pay. As a result, secret agents took advantage of this loophole and spread unfounded rumors such as "sixty catties of millet for one place" and "even stools are taxed," which increased the ideological concerns of street vendors. As a result, there was an initial phenomenon of fear of registration or concealment of capital.

　　(2) Preparatory work is an important key to determining success or failure. Before starting the reorganization, the first thing is to correct the simple urban appearance viewpoint, the attitude of contempt, and the thinking of "reorganizing for the sake of reorganizing" and "moving all" that exist among the cadres. The second is to dispel the ideological doubts and fears of the masses that they are afraid of not having business, and afraid of heavy taxes. At the same time, we must have a full understanding of the situation of street vendors: How is the business of each industry? Who are the customers? Should it be moved? What will happen to the business after moving? What is their ideological situation? In short, we must have an in-depth understanding of the situation and a comprehensive grasp of it. And organize them well. Once the matter has been decided, it must be implemented.

　　(3) The situation of street vendors is very complex. It changes rapidly. If there is a slight deviation in dealing with the problem, it is possible for secret agents to take the opportunity to make trouble. Therefore, unified organization, centralized leadership, and strict implementation of the request and reporting system are very necessary. The Municipal Committee understands and grasps the entire situation in the report; timely educates cadres and solves the difficulties encountered in the progress of the work. So that the reorganization work can be completed in an organized, planned and step-by-step manner.

　　(4) In the case that we lack experience, do not know much about the situation, and the cadre force is not sufficient for distribution, it is necessary to carry out focused work with emphasis, absorb experience, and extend it to others, so as to avoid many mistakes. However, in the process of this reorganization of street vendors, because the experience was not summarized in time, the exchange of experience with each other was not done well enough.

　　(5) Reorganizing street vendors is an arduous mass work. To do a good job in mass work, we must have a mass viewpoint. Pay attention to taking care of the issues that street vendors are most concerned about, that is, after the relocation, is there any business to do? Therefore, when choosing a new market, the location must be appropriate. Whether we designate several places for street vendors to choose, or they put forward several places for us to consider, in short, it must be discussed democratically by the street vendors (at least their representatives). In addition, the same is true for the division of the new market area and the relocation method, which can eliminate the dissatisfaction caused by subjective decisions. At the same time, respect the special customs and habits of ethnic minorities such as Hui people. Generally speaking, new markets do not have the hustle and bustle of major transportation routes. For some necessary and possible equipment, such as installing street lights, tap water, toilets, etc., and using various methods for publicity, we try our best to solve them.

　　(6) In order to facilitate organization, publicity, and grasp of the situation, there must be a considerable number of activists as the backbone. However, we must be cautious when selecting them. Before thoroughly understanding them, we will not give them any power or absorb them into our administrative organs, clearly give them those tasks, and lead them to complete the work. Otherwise, the work will inevitably suffer setbacks. When the Eighth District reorganized the street vendors on Qianmen Street, it relied too much on the activists (group leaders) and let them divide the boundaries of their own group in the new market and notify the members to relocate. They did not lead or inspect themselves. As a result, when it came time to move, many group members could not find their addresses, and even the group leaders could not be found. Some activists in other districts secretly asked street vendors to take money to give to the district government, or they occupied good positions first. This has a very bad impact on the masses.

　　(7) The bandits will not give up their conspiracy to sabotage anything that is beneficial to the people. When reorganizing street vendors, they used our unclear explanation of the policy to create rumors and confuse the public. Or, taking advantage of the fact that our organization is not sound, they use the dissatisfaction of the masses to instigate them. Or appear as a "representative" to petition. Correctly publicizing policies, organizing meticulously, exposing the conspiracy of secret agents in a timely manner, and raising the awareness of the masses. Cooperating with the public security bureau to actively control is an effective way to stop the activities of bandits and secret agents.

　　The problem now is how to manage street vendors and strengthen fire prevention, anti-espionage and other security work in street vendor markets.

　　北平市怎样整理摊贩的？
    本报记者超祺
    平市摊贩整理工作，已经胜利地完成了。这是北平市委正确的领导，各级七百余干部的努力以及群众拥护的结果。
    平市的摊贩，已有相当的历史。自日本投降，国民党匪帮统治，造成许多人的失业，改以摆摊维生，因此已成为一个社会问题。加上北平解放之初，我们忙于接管，没有注意这问题，部分座商为了逃避税收，化整为零出来摆摊，操纵摊贩市场，妨碍了正当摊贩的营业和正当商业之发展。另有少数逃亡地主、流散军人、特务分子，也以摊贩为掩护，阴谋破坏活动。到整理的时候，已有四万五千户之多。他们大部麇集于交通要道，人车受阻，已严重地妨碍交通秩序。为了保护大部分真正摊贩的正当营业，为了整理交通秩序和维持社会治安，市府接受了市民的要求，决定集中力量来整理摊贩秩序。摊贩们对于这次整理，起初思想上有点疑惧。经过五月二十三日叶剑英市长和彭真同志在摊贩代表座谈会上说明我们整理的态度、方针和办法以后，他们一致认识到摊贩必须整理，并且愿协助政府整理。但他们回去后，却强调就地整理，不愿意择地迁移。
    在开始整理的时候，有些区的领导干部，没有深切体会整理摊贩的政策精神，思想上存在单纯的市容观点，或者对这一工作重视不够。曾经使工作受到挫折。同时，有些区的领导干部，一开始就把整理摊贩列为中心工作之一，调动区、街、公安分局大批得力干部来突击这一工作。深入宣传，召开小型摊贩会议，倾听他们的意见。发现积极分子，进行登记及组织工作。随时了解和掌握全面情况，使工作有计划有步骤地进行着。如十二区整理天桥的摊贩就是一个典型。他们开始就成立摊贩整理委员会，里面分宣传及建设两组。区长亲自领导。除建设组外，大部干部都分头深入摊贩中去，有重点的进行突击工作。他们的具体工作步骤是这样的：（一）宣传、动员、了解情况和登记结合。（二）发现积极分子和进行组织。（三）建设新市场，划地编号，发迁移证。（四）迁移。（五）迁移后，建立新秩序，巩固新市场等。
    五月底，市委鉴于全市缺乏一个统一的领导机构，各区的办法步骤均不一致，使部分摊贩乱穿乱窜，逃避整理。各区工作遭到的困难不易解决，偏差不能迅速纠正。特会同市府等联合成立整理摊贩指挥部。市委亲自掌握，打破了区的界限，统一组织，集中领导。并有重点地派干部帮助各区工作。各区每天向指挥部汇报工作情况。所有工作计划、方案均须请示后始能执行。这也是后来工作能迅速而顺利完成的因素之一。
    总结这次整理摊贩的经验，据记者所了解，主要的有以下几点：
    （一）开始就明确宣布正确的政策与方针。摊贩的成分虽很复杂，但大部分是依靠摆摊维生的贫苦市民。对他们，我们是采取保护的方针的。虽然他们很多妨碍了交通，但我们是在帮助他们解决困难的条件下整理交通的。这和国民党的整理有着基本上的区别。但对少数非法摊贩如“贴血”，则坚决取缔。因此获得了大多数摊贩的拥护。惟当我们最初说明摊贩必须纳一定的牌照税的时候，因准备工作未做的好，未能同时公布税额，使摊贩只知应该纳税而不知该纳多少。于是给特务钻了空子，散布“一块地六十斤小米”，“连板凳都纳税”等等无稽谣言，增加了摊贩的思想顾虑。因而有初期怕登记或隐匿资本的现象。
    （二）准备工作是决定成败的重要关键。在未着手整理以前，首先是纠正干部中存在着的单纯市容观点、轻视的态度以及为整理而整理、“要挪全挪”的思想。其次是打通群众怕没买卖，怕抽重税等思想上疑惧。同时对摊贩的情况要有充分的了解：各行的买卖如何？顾客是谁？该不该挪？挪之后买卖怎样？他们的思想状况如何？总之，情况要深入的了解，要全面的掌握。并好好地把他们组织起来。事情既经决定，就要贯彻执行下去。
    （三）摊贩的情况是非常复杂的。瞬息变化万千。处理问题上稍有偏差，就有被特务乘机捣乱的可能。所以统一组织，集中领导，严格执行请示汇报制度，是非常必要的。市委在汇报中了解并掌握整个情况；及时教育干部和解决工作进行中遭遇的困难。使整理工作有组织有计划有步骤地完成。
    （四）在我们既缺乏经验，又不大了解情况，干部力量又不足分配的情况下，要有重点的进行突击工作，吸收经验，推及其他，就免去许多错误。但在这次整理摊贩过程中，因没及时总结经验，所以对互相交换经验是做的很不够的。
    （五）整理摊贩是一个艰巨的群众工作，做好群众工作，就要有群众观点。注意照顾摊贩最关心的问题，那就是迁移后，有没有买卖可做？因此，选择新市场时就要位置适当。不管是由我们指定几个地方给摊贩选择，或是由他们提出几个地方给我们考虑，总之要经摊贩们（至少他们的代表）民主讨论。另外，关于新市场的地区划分，和搬迁办法也是如此，可免除主观决定所发生的不满情绪。同时尊重少数民族如回民的特殊风俗习惯。一般来说，新市场大都没有交通要道的热闹繁华。对于若干必要的而可能做到的设备，如装置路灯、自来水、厕所等等和利用各种方式进行宣传等都尽量解决。
    （六）为了便利进行组织宣传和掌握情况，就要有相当数量的积极分子为骨干。但在选择的时候，必须慎重。没有彻底了解他们以前，暂不予其以任何权力和吸收进我们的行政机构来，明确的给予其那些任务，并领导其完成工作。不然，工作必然遭受挫折。八区在整理前门大街摊贩时，过分依靠积极分子（组长），放手他们去划分新市场自己组里的界线，通知组员迁移。自己不领导、不检查。结果到搬的时候，许多组员找不到地址，甚至连组长也找不着了。还有的区的积极分子，暗中要摊贩拿钱出来送给区政府，或者自己先占住好位置。给群众很坏的影响。
    （七）任何一件有益于人民的事，匪特们都不会放弃破坏的阴谋的。在整理摊贩时，他们利用我们解释政策不明确来制造谣言惑众。或者趁我们的组织未健全，利用群众的不满情绪，加以鼓动。或自以“代表”姿态出现请愿。正确宣传政策，缜密组织，及时揭露特务阴谋，提高群众认识。配合公安局主动的控制，是制止匪特活动的有效办法。
    现在的问题，是如何管理摊贩，以及加强摊贩市场的防火、防特等治安工作。
