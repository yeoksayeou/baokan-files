(Ji'nan Telegram) To restore and develop urban public and private industrial production and support state-owned and cooperative economies, the People's Bank of Ji'nan Branch and its local sub-branches provide discount loans under the principle of benefiting both public and private sectors. Since its launch on May 15th, the branch alone has issued 20.092 million yuan in discount loans (Renminbi) and 14.95 million yuan in credit loans. In June, the Handan City Branch lent a total of 23.08 million yuan to public enterprises, including 10 million yuan to the Tongren Egg Factory from its opening in May to the end of June, 5.68 million yuan to three oil factories, 1.5 million yuan to the Hengtai Textile Factory, and 221,000 yuan to two iron factories; six private copper and iron factories and hemp spinning shops received loans of 27,360 yuan. Linqing and Nangong are also processing loans. According to the current situation, this form of discount or order loan can truly enable both public and private sectors to obtain certain profits and is not affected by price changes. Factories can continue production, and product sales are not affected by the seasons. For example, the Tongren Egg Factory, newly established this year, occupied a large amount of capital for building houses, buying machinery, and raw materials, making it difficult to turn over funds. Only after receiving bank loan support could it start work. The Hengtai Textile Factory obtained loans twice to buy foreign yarn in Weihui, which was 500 to 1,000 yuan cheaper per bundle than in Handan. Not only did it purchase sufficient raw materials, but it also reduced costs and promoted production. With the support of bank order loans, Yi'nao Oil Factory earned a profit of more than 1,000 jin of pure oil in June. The private Xiexing Iron Factory used bank loans to buy 2,000 jin of pig iron and began manufacturing waterwheels. The Yihe Copper Basin Factory received a loan of 50,000 yuan to buy 900 jin of raw copper and can now produce four sets of copper basins a day. Currently, the bank is continuing to deeply understand the situation of various public and private factories to provide appropriate support based on policies to expand production.

　　人民银行冀南分支行
  　折实贷款扶植工业生产
    【冀南电】为恢复与发展城市公私工业生产，扶助国营与合作经济，人民银行冀南分行所属各地支行，在公私两利原则下办理折实放款。自五月十五日举办以来，仅分行折实贷出即二零零九二万元（人民券下同），信用放款贷出一四九五万元。邯郸市行六月份共贷给公营二千三百零八万元，计同仁蛋厂从五月开办到六月底，先后共贷款一千万元，油厂三户五百六十八万元，恒泰纺织厂一百五十万元，铁工厂二户二百廿一万元；私营铜铁工厂及纺麻铺等六户贷款二十七万三千六百元。临清、南宫也正在办理中。根据目前情况研究，这种折实或订货贷款方式，真正可使公仅双方均获得一定利润，不受物价变化影响，各工厂可继续生产，产品推销也不致受季节影响。如同仁蛋敌，今年新创办，建筑房屋，买机器、原料，占用资金很大，无法周转，得到银行贷款支持后，始能开工；恒泰织工厂两次贷款到卫辉买洋纱，每捆比在邯市便宜五百元至一千元。不但购到了充分的原料，还减低了成本，促进了生产。益闹油厂在背月时，得银行订货贷款扶持，在六月份获利合净油一千多斤；私营协兴铁工厂用银行贷款买生铁两千斤，开始制造水车，义合铜盆工厂得到五万元贷款，买生铜九百斤，现在一日能出四套铜盆。目前银行正继续深入各公私工厂了解，以便根据政策予以适当扶植，以扩大生产。
