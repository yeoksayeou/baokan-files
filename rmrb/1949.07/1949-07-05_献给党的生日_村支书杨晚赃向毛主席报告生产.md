　　Dedicated to the Party's Birthday
　　Village Party Secretary Yang Wanzang Reports to Chairman Mao on Production
　　Comrade Yang Wanzang, the Party branch secretary of Jinqu Village, Fourth District, Licheng, Taihang, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting to Chairman Mao on the production situation of the masses in the village, as a gift to commemorate "July 1st." Comrade Yang Wanzang's family used to be poor peasants. Since the Communist Party came, he has turned over after rent reduction and interest reduction and land reform. He joined the Communist Party in 1940. This year, after the democratic rectification of the Party in the first month of the year, he was elected as the branch secretary. He does not know many characters, this letter was dictated by him and written by someone else.
　　Dear Chairman Mao: I was very happy to see in the newspaper that you arrived in Beiping in March. If I were not busy with work, I would definitely go to see you. Now that "July 1st" is approaching, I will report to you on the production situation in our village this year as a small gift for the Party's birthday.
　　Chairman Mao: I used to work as a farmhand for half my life. I am a person who has suffered. After turning over, I joined the Communist Party. After the Party rectification this year, in the first month of the year, the comrades elected me as the branch secretary. My ability is very weak and my work experience is poor. However, I will do my best to serve the masses. Since the end of the democratic rectification and land reform in our village, the cadres and the masses have understood the Party's policies and stabilized their thinking. The enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved, and they are all working hard to get rich. Our village is a village of 289 households. This spring, 29 mutual aid groups were organized according to the principle of voluntary equivalence. The village has more than 5,400 mu of land. The higher authorities said that we have big cities now, and we should grow more cash crops. We have planted all the land that can grow these crops. There are a total of 226 mu of cotton, 236 mu of peanuts, and more than 100 mu of hemp of various sizes. After our county held a Party representative meeting this year, it proposed responding to your call for "one inch longer production." With everyone's efforts, the village hoed 1,856 mu of wheat and topdressed 751 mu. In order to solve the difficulty of labor shortage, 58 women (there are 162 female laborers in the village) were mobilized and organized to participate in agricultural production. In farming, everyone paid attention to deep plowing and careful cultivation. The land that used to be plowed once was plowed twice this year, and the embankments that had collapsed for several years were built and repaired neatly. In terms of fertilization, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu last year was only 20 loads, but this year it is 25 loads per mu on average, and some have even applied 30 loads. This year, wheat harvesting and seedling hoeing were crowded together and everyone was very busy. Our branch committee held a meeting to study the results, carried out organization and adjustment, and organized 136 women and 72 children to cook, take care of children, participate in wheat harvesting, threshing, carrying water, and delivering meals. They worked very hard from early morning to late at night, and successfully completed the wheat harvest in seven days. After the wheat harvest summary, they immediately turned to seedling protection and replanting. At first, everyone had the idea of waiting for rain. We immediately held a meeting of Party members to mobilize them. First, we eliminated the idea of waiting for rain from the Party members, and then we went deep into the mutual aid groups to promote the idea of protecting seedlings as if protecting lives, and proposed to replenish each missing seedling. Under the leadership and promotion of the Party members, water was carried from the river to replant. In four days, 153 mu of missing seedlings in the village were replanted. Now, the cotton in the village has been hoeed once, and the peanuts have been hoeed for the most part. At the meeting of mutual aid group leaders and labor heroes, everyone made a plan for hoeing seedlings: cotton should be hoeed five times, corn should be hoeed twice, and millet should be hoeed three times. Attention should be paid to technology in seedling hoeing, and half of the corn land should be topdressed, in order to increase production by 10% and strive for a good harvest year.
　　In order to avoid delaying production by holding too many meetings, under the leadership of the district committee, everyone jointly studied a method, which proved to be much better than before. It strengthened leadership and did not delay production. That is: our six branch committee cadres adopted a system of rotation, with one branch committee cadre responsible for understanding and reporting the production situation of each mutual aid group every day, each Party member carrying out specific division of labor, and strengthening the Party day system. There is a group meeting every ten days, a branch general meeting every half month, and a branch committee contact meeting every five days (each time for the time it takes to eat a meal). Doing so saves time and solves problems, and everyone is very satisfied. It strengthens leadership and does not delay production.
　　Chairman Mao: You have led our revolution for many years. Now our army has crossed the Yangtze River, liberated Nanjing, Shanghai, and the vast areas of Jiangnan. The whole country is about to be completely liberated. I hope you take good care of your health and lead us well to build a democratic, independent, unified, and prosperous New China.
　　And on behalf of the 30 Party members and all the masses in the village, I salute you!
　　Yang Wanzang, Secretary of the Communist Party Branch of Jinqu Village, Licheng, June 24th.

　　献给党的生日
  　村支书杨晚赃向毛主席报告生产
    太行黎城四区靳曲村党的支部书记杨晚赃同志写信给毛主席，把领导该村群众生产情况向毛主席报告，作为纪念“七一”的礼物，杨晚赃同志从前家庭是贫农，自共产党来后，经过减租减息、土地改革后翻了身，一九四零年参加了共产党。今年正月该村经过民主整党后，被选为支部书记。他识字不多，这封信是他口述别人代笔的。
    亲爱的毛主席：在报上看到你三月间已到了北平，我心中很高兴。不是工作忙，一定要去看看你。现在“七一”已快到，就把俺村今年生产的情况向你报告一下，作为我给党的生日的一点礼物。
    毛主席：我从前做过半辈子长工，是个受苦人，翻身后参加了共产党，今年正月整党后同志们选举我当支部书记，我的能力很弱，工作经验差，不过我有多大本事就拿出多大本事来为群众服务。俺村自从民主整党结束土改后，干部、群众对党的政策都摸清了底，安定了思想，生产情绪大大提高，都在闹发家致富了。俺村是一个二百八十九户的村子，今春按自愿等价的原则组织起二十九个互助小组，全村有土地五千四百多亩，上级说咱们有了大城市了，应该多种经济作物，我们就把能种这些庄稼的土地都种了，一共有二百二十六亩棉花，二百三十六亩花生，一百多亩大小麻。今年俺县开过党代表会议后，提出了响应你生产长一寸的号召，在大家的努力下，今年全村锄麦一千八百五十六亩，上追肥七百五十一亩。为了解决劳力缺乏的困难，发动组织了五十八个妇女（全村有妇女劳力一百六十二个）参加农业生产。在耕种上大家注意了深耕细作，往年犁一遍的地，今年都犁了两遍，塌了好几年的边堰都垒起来修的整整齐齐的。在上肥来说，去年每亩平均只上肥二十驮，今年平均每亩上二十五驮，有个别的还上了三十驮，今年割麦锄苗挤在一起大家很忙，我们支委会召开会议研究结果，进行组织调剂，老婆做饭、看小孩，组织一百三十六个妇女，七十二个儿童，参加割麦、打场、担水、送饭，起早搭黑干的很紧，在七天中胜利完成了麦收。麦收总结后立即转进了保苗补种，起初大家有等雨思想，我们即召开党员大会动员，首先解除了党员等雨思想，然后深入互助组宣传保苗如保命，提出做到缺一根补一根，在党员的带头推动下从河里担水补种，四天中补完全村一百五十三亩缺苗地。现在全村棉花普遍锄过一次，花生锄了一大半。在互助组组长及劳动英雄会议上，大家订出了锄苗计划：棉花要锄五次，玉茭锄两次，谷子锄三遍。在锄苗中要注意技术，并争取玉茭地一半上追肥，为增产一成，争取一个好年成而奋斗。
    为了避免多开会耽误生产，在区分委会领导下，大家共同研究出一个办法，试起来比以前好得多，既然加强了领导，又耽误不了生产。就是：我们六个支委干部采取轮流值日制，每天一个支委干部负责了解汇报各互助组的生产情况，每个党员进行具体分工，并加强了党日制。十天一次小组会，半月一次支部大会，五天一次支委接头会（每次开一顿饭工夫）。这样做起来又节省时间，能解决问题，大家都很满意。既加强了领导，又不耽误生产。
    毛主席：你领导咱们革命好多年了，现在咱们的军队已过了长江，解放南京、上海及江南广大地区，全国就要完全解放了，希望你好好保养身体，好好领导咱们把民主、独立、统一、富强的新中国建设好。
    并代表全村三十名党员与全体群众向你致敬！
    黎城靳曲村中共支部书记杨晚脏六月二十四日。
