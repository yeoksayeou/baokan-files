　　President and People Work Together
　　Actively Rebuild Warsaw
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 20th] Warsaw Dispatch: The East-West thoroughfare, running through the Polish capital and stretching 6.76 kilometers, along with 53 apartment buildings totaling 220,000 cubic meters on both sides, was completed on July 17th. Over 22,000 trees have been planted along the road. This is one of the massive projects to rebuild Warsaw.
　　The Hitler bandit gang deliberately destroyed Warsaw. Eighty-five percent of the buildings were destroyed. Ten thousand buildings were razed to the ground, three thousand buildings were largely destroyed, and only seven percent of the buildings were habitable. Now, almost all of Warsaw's buildings have been rebuilt. The following figures illustrate the speed of the Polish capital's revival: 382 school buildings, 20 hospitals, 38 libraries, 14 theaters, 6 cinemas, and 4 museums have been built or restored. Warsaw now has nearly 600,000 inhabitants. Government agencies, buildings of political and mass organizations, scientific and other research institutions are under construction in the city center. Many new apartments are being built near parks and gardens. Previously, narrow and winding small streets were a characteristic of the city; now, wide and straight avenues lined with trees have replaced them.
　　Tens of thousands of Warsaw residents, as well as people from other cities and villages in Poland, participated in the work of rebuilding the capital. Every Sunday, one can see the President of the Republic, Bierut, and the working masses, scientists, housewives, soldiers, officers, factory foremen, as well as peasants from some distant villages, young people and white-haired elders, shoulder to shoulder, dedicating several hours of voluntary labor to the reconstruction of Warsaw. Approximately 40,000 construction workers are engaged in the construction of Warsaw. In Warsaw, a labor competition has been launched to accelerate the skills of bricklaying masters. Leading the way is bricklayer Putasinski, who laid 15,000 bricks in one shift. The Polish capital is being reborn on the unprecedented initiative of the broad masses of working people.

　　总统和人民并肩劳动
  　积极重建华沙
    【新华社北平二十日电】华沙消息：贯穿波兰首都、全长六点七六公里的东西大马路，连同两旁二十二万立方公尺的五十三座公寓，已于七月十七日修成，路旁栽种了二万二千多株树。这是重建华沙的巨大工程之一。
    希特勒匪帮曾蓄意破坏华沙。百分之八十五的建筑物被毁。一万座建筑物被夷为平地，三千座建筑物大部分被破坏，只有百分之七的建筑物可以居住。现在华沙的建筑物，几乎全部是重建的。以下的数字可以说明波兰首都复兴的速度：三百八十二座校舍、二十座医院、三十八座图书馆、十四座戏院、六座电影院、四座博物馆业已建造或修复。华沙现有将近六十万人口。政府机关、政治与群众团体的建筑物、科学及其他研究机关正在市中心建设中。公园与花园附近正在建筑许多新公寓。从前，狭窄而弯曲的小街道是该市的特色，现在，两旁种有树木的宽阔而笔直的大道已取而代之。
    成千成万的华沙居民以及波兰其他城市与乡村的人民，都参加了重建首都的工作。每逢星期日，人们可以看到共和国总统贝鲁特和工人群众、科学家、主妇、士兵、军官、工厂领班以及来自某些辽远乡村的农民，青年和白发老人，肩并肩地为华沙重建工作献出好几小时的义务劳动。约有四万建筑工人从事于建设华沙的工作。在华沙，业已发动了加速砌砖能手的劳动竞赛。名列前茅的是砌砖工人蒲塔辛斯基，他在一个轮班中砌砖一万五千块。波兰首都正在广大劳动人民群众的空前积极的基础上新生起来。
