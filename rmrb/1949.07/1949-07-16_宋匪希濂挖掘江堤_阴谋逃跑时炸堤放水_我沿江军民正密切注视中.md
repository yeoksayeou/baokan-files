Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 15th. Song Xilian, commander of the Kuomintang bandit army's Xiang-E Pacification Zone, is increasingly exposed for his heinous plot to sabotage the Yangtze River embankments near Shashi. On the 20th of last month, Song secretly ordered a part of the bandit army to dig a tunnel on the Tiegu Niu River embankment south of Shashi, only a few feet from the water, preparing to breach the embankment and release water to prevent the advance of the People's Liberation Army when they fled. Recently, the bandit army has also forced laborers to dig a two-li long, three-foot wide, and four-foot deep trench on the most dangerous section of the Shashi Baota River area embankment, where the water is deep and the current is rapid, preparing to bury explosives and destroy the embankment during their retreat. If Song's plot is realized, the vast area of more than 30,000 square li east of Shashi, south of the Han River, and north of the Yangtze River, including the eight counties of Jiangling, Mianyang, Qianjiang, Jianli, Hanchuan, Tianmen, Xiaogan, and Jingmen, will be turned into a watery swamp, two million people will be homeless, and three million mu of paddy fields will be flooded. The spokesperson of the Fourth Field Army Command of the People's Liberation Army issued a serious warning to Song on the 30th of last month regarding this heinous plan. Currently, the military and civilians in the liberated areas along the river are closely watching the development of Song's plot.

    阴谋逃跑时炸堤放水
    我沿江军民正密切注视中
    【新华社汉口十五日电】国民党匪军湘鄂绥区司令宋希濂，阴谋破坏沙市附近的长江堤岸罪恶计划已日益暴露。上月二十日，宋匪密令匪军一部，在沙市以南的铁古牛江堤上，挖了一个距水仅数尺的阴道，准备在其逃窜时掘堤放水，以阻止解放军前进。最近匪军又强迫民工在水深流急的最险要的沙市宝塔河区江堤上，挖成一道长二里、宽三尺、深四尺的长沟，准备在败退时埋置炸药，将江堤炸毁。如宋匪此项阴谋一旦实现，则沙市以东，汉水以南，长江以北的三万余方里内的广大地区，包括江陵、沔阳、潜江、监利、汉川、天门、孝感、荆门等八县均将变成泽国，二百万人民将无家可归，三百万亩水田将遭淹没。人民解放军第四野战军司令部发言人于上月三十日对宋匪此项罪恶计划，已提出严重警告，现解放区沿江军民，对宋匪此项阴谋的发展，正密切注视中。
