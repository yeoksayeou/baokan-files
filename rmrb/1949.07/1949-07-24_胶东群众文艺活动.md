　　Mass Literary and Art Activities in Jiaodong
　　Ma Shaobo Jiang Feng

　　The revolutionary literary and art activities of the masses in Jiaodong began to develop in 1937. However, before 1942, they were still subject to seasonal restrictions, only active during the New Year and Spring Festival. After the reduction of rent and interest, the lives of the masses were initially improved, and the demand for cultural entertainment increased unprecedentedly. In addition, the exemplary influence and guidance of literary and art groups of the army and local authorities, as well as amateur cultural and entertainment activities of troops, government offices, factories, and schools, regularly provided cultural entertainment materials. Cultural and entertainment work was then developed extensively and deeply. In particular, according to the spirit of Chairman Mao's report at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, the Shandong Party strengthened its leadership over literary and art work, and made clear decisions to enrich the literary association's organizations and cadres. The sound organization and enriched cadres of the Jiaodong Literary Association in 1943 made the work develop in a more organized way. Breaking the seasonal restrictions on mass cultural and entertainment activities started from this decision.

　　Therefore, the mass literary and art activities in Jiaodong have the following characteristics:

　　I. Systematic organization and leadership.

　　The Jiaodong Literary Association was established in 1938 (named the Cultural Association) as the leading organization for mass literary and art work in the Jiaodong area; literary associations were generally established in each military sub-district, city, and county, as intermediate liaison organizations; districts and villages had cultural and educational committees, especially village cultural committees and urban production departments, all had clubs (including literacy schools, theatrical troupes, yangko propaganda teams, wall paintings, street poetry, blackboard newspapers, slogans, reading groups, and other cultural and entertainment organizations). These were the grassroots organizations of the mass literary and art movement, and it can be said that they were the most fundamental guarantee for forming the movement. Literary associations at all levels had vertical leadership relationships and the task of guiding worker-peasant clubs.

　　In addition, various cultural mass organizations were also widely organized, such as the Teachers' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, the Artists' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and the Blind People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. These organizations were led by the Literary Association and played a very important bridging role.

　　With the above systematic and complete organizational construction, especially the guarantee of the grassroots organizations of the mass literary and art movement, all central tasks could be quickly and widely implemented to the villages through organizations at all levels, that is to say, it could quickly form a movement.

　　II. Closely integrated with political tasks.

　　Before 1942, some villages still had purely recreational views and some frivolous, vulgar, and policy-violating shortcomings. After repeated emphasis and correction, these were generally overcome. Before the reduction of rent and interest, village branches did not have enough control over cultural and entertainment work, so a few clubs were controlled by hooligans. When the reduction of rent and interest began, the masses were initially mobilized, and the cultural and educational committees strengthened leadership, generally regarding literary and art activities as an important weapon to cooperate with the work. For example, in the War of Resistance Against Japan, to carry out political offensives against the enemy, some village theater troupes combined with the troops and often went deep into enemy areas three or four miles away from the enemy's strongholds to perform; to cooperate with the work of reducing rent and interest, they wrote and performed scripts guiding the reduction of rent and interest; to carry out the large-scale production movement, they wrote and performed scripts mobilizing and guiding production; and the same was true for the cooperation of tasks such as joining the army, supporting the front, land reform, supporting the army, and current affairs propaganda. Generally, they attached great importance to cooperating with political tasks, and it became a habit. Even blind artists, when arranging each central task, always took the initiative to compose or find drum lyrics related to it to sing. The masses were also very combative in terms of writing and performing. In order to cooperate with the central task, they could often write and perform plays in three or four days, and the performances were vivid and practical. Their performance level gradually improved on the basis of popularization. Statistics in 1946 showed that 5,000 rural theater troupes performed "The White-Haired Girl" in coordination with the land reform movement. In Yaqian County, 30 rural theater troupes could perform "Passing the Barrier." Small plays such as "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" and "Prodigal Son Returns" could be widely performed, and some villages could also perform new Peking operas, such as "Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang" and "Li Zicheng Enters Beijing."

　　Their cultural and entertainment activities, in addition to street poetry, books, and singing, mainly took the form of drama, including ballad opera, yangko opera, spoken drama, Peking opera,锣鼓剧 (锣鼓剧 is a type of Chinese opera characterized by its heavy use of percussion instruments), foreign films, Wu Lao Er (武老二 might be a type of local performance or a specific play), acrobatics, and living newspapers. Generally, they all had content, combined with political propaganda and self-education. Every major festival or propaganda week, celebration meeting, the entire village, district, county, and even the entire Jiaodong would act together, with great momentum and enthusiasm! Cultural and entertainment activities were generally appropriately combined with production labor, and funds could generally be solved from their own production.

　　III. Self-written, self-directed, and improvised dramas and yangko dances formed a widespread mass movement.

　　In the process of checking and reducing (that is, checking and reducing rent work), fighting against local bullies, and land reform, the masses compiled the facts of being oppressed and bullied by local bullies in their villages into living newspapers, yangko dances, and ballad dramas, and performed them in their own villages, neighboring villages, and market towns. The true feelings were touching. Every market day, there were always five or six to more than a dozen yangko teams performing continuously. Taking Caomiao Village in Weihai as an example, if they needed to conduct class education through recalling suffering within three days, they would base on the materials of their own village and listen to the personal accounts of the parties concerned, recorded by elementary school teachers. The collective writing was mainly by farmers, combined with teachers and old yangko singers, word by word. They could write it in one night and recite the lines the next day. They often started rehearsing without waiting for the lines to be familiar. The rehearsal space combined reading the lines, and generally, they acted themselves and directed themselves. It was almost completely real people on stage. Some bullies, after being educated, also participated in the performance of their initial bullying of the poor. The Caomiao Village Theater Troupe wrote more than 40 dramas and yangko dances in half a year, and won the first prize in the joint performance in Weihai City. The script "Who Harmed Our Family?" which they wrote, also won the first prize in the drama category C group in the Jiaodong Art Competition. Their best scripts also included "Funeral of a Dog" and "Eight Jia Prince." There were many such villages. In the winter of 1945, the Jiaodong Literary Association received 700 drama manuscripts. In the third award evaluation held by the Literary Association during the Spring Festival of 1947, the number of submissions reached 2,500.

　　Self-written, self-directed, and improvised activities are two of the more powerful ways to combine mass education, encourage mass creation, and carry out practical and extensive in-depth literary and art movements.

　　IV. Intellectuals and workers and peasants are closely combined.

　　In mass literary and art work, the combination of workers, peasants, and intellectuals plays a decisive role. Farmers do not know musical scores, and elementary school teachers teach them to sing. Some farmers do not know the lyrics of the play, and elementary school teachers teach them to read. They help with accompaniment, help with directing, and even help with writing wall newspapers and drawing murals. They play a very important bridging role in mass cultural and entertainment activities. At the same time, the thoughts and feelings of intellectuals have also been fundamentally transformed in practical work and in mass movements. In Jiaodong, elementary school principals or teachers can participate in the village cultural and educational committees, and district education and rescue association directors can participate in the district cultural and educational committees. Therefore, they have a more timely understanding of central tasks and policies, and their cooperation is closer and more practical. Usually, it is of an amateur help nature. Before and after the New Year and Spring Festival, when schools are on vacation, the central task is to combine with the masses to carry out cultural and entertainment activities. As for the literary and art workers of government agencies and organizations going to the countryside to help, they carry out key assistance, and generally achieve close integration with the peasant masses.

　　At present, due to the insufficient attention paid to mass literary and art work by some leading comrades, and the passive response of literary and art cadres to the work of government agencies and evening parties, they have failed to play their organizational and guiding role. In addition, literary and art cadres do not go deep enough into the masses, their theoretical level is not high, and they cannot keep up with the development of the work and cannot meet the needs of the masses. Therefore, the Jiaodong literary and art movement has not yet been fully developed as it should be.

　　Postscript:

　　The above is just a brief introduction to the characteristics of Jiaodong mass literary and art activities. The literary and art work of the troops will be introduced in another article, so it is not mentioned here. (July 1949 in Beiping)

　　胶东群众文艺活动
    马少波  江风
    胶东群众的革命文艺活动，自一九三七年，即开始发展。不过在一九四二年以前还受着季节性的限制，只是新年春节活跃一时，减租减息以后，群众生活得到了初步的改善，文化娱乐要求空前提高，加以军队和地方的文艺团体以及部队、机关、工厂、学校业余文化娱乐活动的示范影响，指导推动，经常供给文化娱乐材料，文化娱乐工作才得到普遍深入的开展，尤其根据毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的报告的精神，山东党对文艺工作的加强领导，充实文协机构与干部，都有了明确的决定。一九四三年胶东文协的健全机构，充实干部，使工作更有组织的发展，群众文化娱乐活动打破了季节的限制，就是从这一决定开始。
    因此，胶东群众的文艺活动，有着如下的特点：
    一、有系统的组织领导。
    胶东文协成立于一九三八年，（名称是文化协会）为胶东地区群众文艺工作的领导组织；各军分区、市、县都普遍建立文协，为中间联系组织；区、村有文教委员会，特别是村文委会以及城市生产部门都有俱乐部（包括民校、剧团、秧歌宣传队、墙画、街头诗、黑板报、标语、读报组等文娱组织），这是群众文艺运动的基层组织，也可以说，是形成运动最基本的保证。各级文协有垂直领导关系，对工农俱乐部有指导的任务。
    此外，并普遍组织各种文化性的群众团体，如教师抗日救国会、艺人抗救会、盲人抗救会等，这些团体都由文协领导，起很重要的桥梁作用。
    有了以上系统完整的组织建设，特别是群众文艺运动的基层组织的保证，所有中心任务，都可以通过各级组织，迅速而广泛地贯彻到村，就是说可以很快地形成运动。
    二、紧密结合政治任务。
    一九四二年前，有些村庄还有单纯娱乐观点，及某些轻佻、庸俗、违反政策的毛病，经屡次强调纠正，一般的都得到克服。减租减息之前，村支部对文娱工作掌握不够，因而少数的俱乐部曾被二流子所掌握。减租减息开始，群众初步发动起来了，文教委员会加强领导，一般的把文艺活动作为配合工作的重要武器。如在抗战中，开展对敌政治攻势，有些村剧团和部队结合，常常深入到离敌人据点三、四里路的敌区演出；配合减租减息工作，则编演指导减租减息的剧本；开展大生产运动，则编演动员与指导生产的剧本；他如参军、支前、土改、拥军、时事宣传工作的配合，都是如此，一般对配合政治任务，都极为重视，而且也成了习惯。甚至盲艺人当布置每次中心工作时，他们总是主动的编作或找与此有关的鼓词演唱。群众在编演方面也很战斗化，为了配合中心工作，他们常常在三四天内即可编剧演出，而且演的生动、实际。他们演出水平是在普及基础上逐渐提高的，一九四六年统计：配合土地改革运动，即有五千个农村剧团演出过“白毛女”。牙前一县，能演出“过关”的农村剧团达三十个。“兄妹开荒”、“败子回头”等小型剧，可以普遍演出，有的村庄还能演新平剧，如“三打祝家庄”、“闯王进京”。
    他们文娱活动除街头诗、书、及歌唱外，以戏剧为主要形式，计有小调歌剧、秧歌剧、话剧、平剧、锣鼓剧、洋片、武老二、杂耍、活报等形式，一般的都有内容，结合政治宣传，结合自我教育，每逢较大的节日或宣传周，庆祝大会，总是全村、全区、全县乃至全胶东一齐活动，声势浩大，热火朝天！文娱活动一般的可与生产劳动适当结合，经费也能一般的作到从自己的生产中解决。
    三、自编自演即编即演的戏剧秧歌，形成了广泛的群众运动。
    在查减（即检查减租工作）反恶霸及土改当中，群众将本村受恶霸压迫欺侮的事实，编成活报秧歌和小调剧，在本村并到邻村及市集上演出，真情动人，每逢集日，总有五、六帮到十几帮秧歌队连续演出。以威海草庙村为例，如在三天内要通过回忆诉苦，进行阶级教育，即根据本村材料，并听取当事人的亲自诉说，由小学教师记录，以农民为主体结合教师和老秧歌手，口搿口的集体编写，边编边记，一晚上就可编好，第二天就可念词，他们常常并不等词熟就着手排练，排演空间结合读词，一般的作到自己演自己，自己导自己，几乎完全是真人上台，也有的恶霸经教育后参加表演他当初欺侮穷人的事实。草庙村剧团半年间编写戏剧秧歌达四十多个，到威海市参加联合公演获头奖，他们编写的“谁害了咱一家？”剧本，参加胶东文艺竞赛，也荣获戏剧类丙组第一奖，他们最好的剧本还有“出狗殡”、“八甲王子”等。这样的村庄很多。一九四五年冬，胶东文协收到剧稿七百余件，一九四七年春节文协举行的第三次奖评，应征稿件达二千五百件。
    自编自演，即编即演的活动，在结合群众教育，鼓励群众创作，开展实际而又广泛深入的文艺运动上，是比较有力的方式之二。
    四、知识份子和工农亲密结合。
    群众的文艺工作，工农和知识份子的给合，是起着决定作用的。农民不识曲谱，小学教师教他们唱，有些农民不识剧词，小学教师教他们读。帮助伴奏，帮助导演，以至帮助编墙报，画壁画，他们在群众文娱活动中起着很重要的桥梁作用。同时，知识份子的思想情感在实际工作中，在群众运动中，也获得了根本的改造。在胶东，小学校长或教员可以参加村文教委员会，区教救会长可参加区文教会。因此，在对中心工作和政策的了解上，比较及时，配合工作较为紧密切实。平时是业余帮助性质，新年春节前后，学校放假，就以结合群众进行文娱活动为中心工作。至于机关团体的文艺工作者下乡帮助，是有重点的进行，一般的也作到了和农民群众的亲密结合。
    目前由于有的领导同志对群众的文艺工作重视不够，文艺干部被动的应付机关工作，机关晚会，未能发挥其组织指导的作用。加以文艺干部深入群众还不够，理论水平不高，跟不上工作的发展，不能满足群众的需要，因而胶东文艺运动还没有得到它应有的充分的发展。

    以上只是简略介绍一下胶东群众文艺活动的特点，关于部队文艺工作，有另文介绍，故未能谈及。（一九四九年七月于北平）
