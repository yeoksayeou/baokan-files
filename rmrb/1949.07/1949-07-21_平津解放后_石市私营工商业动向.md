　　Trends in Private Industry and Commerce in Shijiazhuang After the Liberation of Beiping and Tianjin

　　After the liberation of Beiping and Tianjin, a new situation has emerged in the economic sphere of Shijiazhuang. This is the sluggishness of some private industrial and commercial enterprises, which is mixed with the impact of the lean season, although some industries are still active. This complex phenomenon has made some people lose their way, and even think that after the liberation of big cities, the future of industrial and commercial enterprises in small and medium-sized cities is bleak. This view is obviously wrong. Taking Shijiazhuang as an example, it has development prospects in terms of access to industrial raw materials, market position, and convenient transportation. Currently, it is moving from an abnormal period to a normal path.

　　Since the liberation in November of the year before last, the economy of Shijiazhuang has undergone fundamental changes. Industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood have been increasing day by day. At the time of liberation, there were 722 private industrial enterprises in the city. By October of the following year, this number had increased to 1,383, and by May of this year, it had increased to 1,694. The total increase was more than 134 percent; commerce increased by 30 percent. Among them, major industries such as the cotton weaving industry increased from 31 households to 65 households, and the iron industry increased from 50 households to 68 households; while luxury industries such as gold shops and silk shops have been shrinking and have now mostly switched to other businesses. This is mainly due to the correct implementation of the policy of developing industry and commerce by the democratic government, and the fact that Shijiazhuang after liberation is connected to the vast liberated rural areas around it, changing the isolated situation during the enemy occupation. Therefore, the strengthening of urban-rural links and the smooth flow of materials have also played a significant role in the development of industrial and commercial enterprises in Shijiazhuang. At the same time, Shijiazhuang is the first larger city liberated in North China, and people from all over came to purchase goods. There was a general feeling that the supply of general materials was insufficient, and the profits of various industries were extremely high. The loss of this temporary advantageous condition began to show signs from the liberation of Jinan. After the liberation of Beiping and Tianjin, it became even more obvious. Many customers in Shijiazhuang have turned to Beiping and Tianjin. Taking the iron industry as an example, the wheelbarrows produced by Shen Yongxing, the largest private iron factory in Shijiazhuang, are technically inferior and more expensive than those produced in Tianjin. The Wufu cloth and Sunshine cloth of the China Textile Corporation have replaced the Shanlu cloth of the Daxing Yarn Factory, and the sales of Shanlu cloth are not as good as before. The Xingqiu cloth produced by private factories is of poor quality and high price, and there is no market in the city. For example, on June 12, the cost of each Xingqiu cloth was 9,887 yuan, while the market price was only 8,500 yuan, while Wufu cloth was only 11,000 yuan. At the same time, Beiping and Tianjin have strong financial resources and large throughput, and radio broadcasts transmit market information every day. Therefore, the general prices in Shijiazhuang have to directly follow the Beiping and Tianjin markets. These changes have made some industrial and commercial enterprises in Shijiazhuang feel that the market is shrinking and they have no way out.

　　This sluggishness of some industrial and commercial markets is temporary. After the liberation of large cities such as Beiping and Tianjin, transportation in various places has gradually recovered, and materials are flowing smoothly. Shijiazhuang is located at the transportation hub of North China, and the transportation business is becoming increasingly active. The export of mountain goods such as bristles, fur, and walnuts produced nearby has also increased compared with the past. For example, the Wang Youhe cart shop averages four or five cars and seven or eight carts staying there every day. In mid-April, the materials transported to Beiping through the shop included 12,760 catties of tobacco, six boxes and eight pieces of cigarettes, 6,200 bolts of homespun cloth, as well as cotton, soap, and various mountain goods. Industries such as freight yards, hotels, and cart shops throughout the city are showing prosperity. In terms of industry, Shijiazhuang has convenient transportation and is close to cotton-producing areas and coal and iron mines. Raw materials are convenient, which is more advantageous than Tianjin and southern Hebei. Although the number of industrial enterprises in Shijiazhuang has increased in the past year or so, due to the limitations of the war environment, there has been a lack of improvement in equipment and technology, resulting in lower product quality and higher costs. Before the liberation of large cities, they could cope with monopolizing the market; under the competition of high-quality and low-priced products from large cities, they were naturally bound to fail. However, after the forces of imperialist economic aggression are driven out of China, China has a vast land and abundant resources, and various industries are relatively immature. There are vast markets everywhere, and the liberation of large cities and the establishment of international trade have begun. Purchasing new production tools to improve technology, reduce costs, open up new sales channels, and restore the old markets before the incident are all new favorable conditions. Based on the new needs and objective conditions, it is certain that the improvement of industrial and commercial enterprises in Shijiazhuang has development prospects. Taking the cotton weaving industry as an example, more than 60 weaving factories in the city have no market for Xingqiu cloth, and more than half of them have switched to weaving striped cloth. In addition, three factories are trying to weave printed cloth. On June 12, the cost of each bolt of striped cloth (general) was 3,938 yuan (20-count yarn, 10 yards), and the wages, depreciation, and other expenses were 20 catties of millet. It could be sold for 5,000 yuan at a high price. Printed cloth had to be printed in Tianjin or Gaoyang, and each bolt cost about 30 catties of millet for labor and transportation, and the profit was about the same as striped cloth. Recently, Xinhua and Chengcheng Weaving Factories have tried using small electric motors, which doubles the annual output of weaving machines, and the quality is more uniform than before. This is still a preliminary test, and the cost can be reduced after continuous improvement in many places. Striped cloth and printed cloth are suitable for the needs of the vast rural areas, and the main sales areas are Shanxi and southern Hebei, and a part can also be sold in the city. Recently, Yihexin Dyeing Factory has installed a new calendering machine and plans to add printing equipment. If it can be widely promoted, the cost of printed cloth can be reduced, and the quality of the cloth can also be improved after calendering.

　　The second is the iron industry. The native-made woks and Yangquan native woks in Shijiazhuang had a wide sales area before the war, extending south along the Pinghan Railway directly across the Yellow River, east to the Bohai Sea, and north to Guanwai. These markets have lost contact for many years during the war. Recently, state-owned iron goods companies have sent personnel to various places to investigate, and sales have gradually opened up. When the Pinghan Railway is repaired within the year, sales can be expanded. Another major product of the iron industry is waterwheels. Each factory contracts orders from the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency. According to the North China Five-Year to Seven-Year Water Conservancy Development Plan, waterwheels still need to be promoted within a few years in the one city and eight counties under the Shijiazhuang Branch of the Agency. However, the waterwheel production technology in Shijiazhuang is backward, and of the 400 vehicles produced each month, only 200 meet the standards. The agency is currently helping each factory to study and improve technology, and has initially implemented division of labor in manufacturing in each factory.

　　Based on the operating conditions of the above two major private industries, it has been proven that private industry in the city has development prospects after the liberation of Beiping and Tianjin. In the future, in order to accelerate the industrial construction of the city, it is necessary to strengthen leadership and carry out improvements in a planned way:

　　First, joint ventures and improved tools. Private industries in Shijiazhuang are mostly small-scale handicrafts and independent laborers, with very little capital and simple equipment. For example, the weaving industry generally has only three or four wooden machines, and the working capital is only a dozen bundles of yarn. Only a few electric grinding mills have a maximum of 15 horsepower electric motors. Most of the more than 50 soap industries produce only about 1,000 pieces of soap per day. If the weaving industry adds a 5 horsepower electric motor, it will require 30 bundles of yarn. Therefore, in addition to loans from banks, it mainly relies on joint ventures between factories.

　　Second, establish supply and marketing cooperatives in various industries. The first is to solve the problem of long-distance sales, which is an urgent problem at present, and it is very difficult to do it alone. Recently, the knitting industry has tried to jointly transport and sell. Seven companies have first formed a transportation and sales team and sold more than 100 dozen socks in Yuci, with good results. There are similar practices in the weaving industry. This will not only solve the sales problem, but also allow for the collective purchase of raw materials. Of course, it is also necessary to maintain close contact with state-owned trading companies in order to achieve better results.

　　Third, reduce the cost of raw materials. Although Shijiazhuang is close to cotton, coal, and iron producing areas, the cost of products is high and the quality is poor due to the backward smelting and spinning technology compared with Tianjin and southern Hebei, making it impossible to compete with them. For example, the quality of 20-count yarn from Daxing Yarn Factory is poor, and sales in Shijiazhuang are unfavorable, while Hebei Village yarn is often in short supply. If Daxing's yarn can reduce costs and sell at a lower price, it will be even more beneficial to the development of the weaving industry. The raw materials for other iron industries account for the vast majority of the cost. State-owned enterprises control these production raw materials! Appropriate profits should be determined based on product quality and general prices, otherwise it will be detrimental to the development of certain productions.

　　Fourth, implement labor-capital mutual benefit and united production. Because most of the industries in Shijiazhuang are handicraft workshops, the labor-capital relationship still has some feudal characteristics. For example, the working hours of weaving, electric grinding, and iron industries are generally more than 12 hours. Some capitalists are afraid of not being able to control the workers, so they use relatives and family members to work. This feudal relationship affects the production mood and hinders the organization of joint ventures. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a normal working system, properly take care of the lives of workers, and unite to develop production.

　　Recently, a match factory and Changlu Salt Company have been newly established in Shijiazhuang; large-scale egg-beating factories, clothing factories, cotton ginning factories, and native product companies are actively preparing. The establishment of these factories and companies will first solve the unemployment problem and transfer many urban residents and farmers to industrial production, and the lives of working people will be generally improved. Therefore, the industrial and commercial enterprises in Shijiazhuang are not in recession, but are beginning to move towards the road of development, and this development is advancing with the development of the entire revolutionary situation.

### 平津解放后　石市私营工商业动向

　　平津解放后
  　石市私营工商业动向
    平津解放以后，石家庄经济方面出现了一种新的情况，这就是夹杂在青黄不接的季节影响下，一些私营工商业表现冷落，虽然有些行业仍然呈现活跃。这个复杂的现象使有些人坠入五里雾中，甚至以为大城市解放以后，中小城市工商业前途暗淡了，这种看法显然是不对的，以石家庄来说，从工业原料的取得或市场地位、交通方便等条件来看，都是有发展前途的，目前正是从不正常的时期走上正常的道路。
    从前年十一月解放时开始，石家庄经济发生了基本的变化。有益于国计民生的工商业日见增加，解放时全市私营工业共七百廿二户，翌年十月增加到一千三百八十三户，至本年五月已增加到一千六百九十四户。共增加百分之一百三十四强；商业增加了百分之三十。其中主要工业如棉织业由三十一户增到六十五户，铁工业由五十户增到六十八户；而金店、绸缎等奢侈行业则日趋萎缩，现已绝大部分转业，这主要是由于民主政府正确地执行了发展工商业政策，而解放后的石家庄与四周广大解放区农村连成一片，改变了敌占时期的孤立形势，因此城乡联系加强物资畅流，对石市工商业发展也起了很大作用；同时，石家庄是华北第一解放的较大城市，各地均来购货一般物资都感供不应求，各业利润极大，这个暂时的优越条件的丧失，从济南解放开始略见端倪。平津解放后更加表面化。石家庄许多顾客都转到平津去了。以铁业来说，石家庄最大的私营铁工厂沈永兴的元车与天津出产的比较已显技术低落，价高贵；中纺公司的五福布、阳光布代替了大兴纱厂山鹿布，山鹿布销路不如从前，私人工厂出产的星球布，质次价昂，在本市没有销路，如六月十二日星球布每匹成本九千八百八十七元，市价仅八千五百元，而五福布不过一万一千元。同时平津资力雄厚，吞吐量大，每天又有无线电广播传达行情，所以石市一般物价不得不直接听从平津市场，这些变化，使石市某些工商业感到市场缩小，而本身没有出路。
    这种某些工商业市场的冷落是暂时的，而平津等大城市解放以后，各地交通逐渐恢复，物资畅流，石市正当华北交通枢纽，运输业务日趋活跃，附近出产的猪鬃、皮毛、核桃等山货出口也较前增多。如王友和大车店，平均每天住汽车四、五辆，大车七、八辆，四月中旬经该店运往北平物资即有烟丝一万二千七百六十斤，纸烟六箱另八件，土布六千二百匹，另有棉花、肥皂及各种山货等。全市货栈、旅馆、大车等行业都显兴旺。以工业来说，石家庄交通方便，接近产棉区，及煤铁矿山，原料方便，比天津、冀南各地条件更为优越。而过去一年多石市工业在数量上虽有增加，但因受战争环境限制缺乏在设备和技术上提高，因而出品质量较低，成本又高，大城市解放前独占市场，还可以应付；和大城市物美价廉的产品竞争之下，自然是要失败的。但是帝国主义经济侵略的势力被赶出中国以后，中国地大物博，各种工业都相当幼稚，到处都是广大市场，而且大城市解放，国际贸易，已开始建立，购买新式的生产工具改良技术，减低成本，打开新销路，恢复事变前的旧市场，这又都是新的有利条件。根据新的需要和客观条件未改进石市工商业有发展前途是可以肯定的。以棉织业来说，全市六十余户织布厂星球布没有销路，现一半以上都改织条子布，另有三家试织印花布，六月十二日，每匹条子布成本（一般的）三千九百三十八元（廿支纱十码）工资及折旧等开支二十斤小米，高价可售五千元；印花布要到天津或高阳去印花，每匹加手工和运费约三十斤小米，利润和条子布差不多。最近新华，成城织布厂试用小型电动机，每年织布机产量提高一倍，质地也较前均匀，现在还是初步试验，许多地方陆续改进后，成本还可以减低。条子布和印花布，适合广大农村需要，主要销路为山西和冀南，市内也可销一部份。最近义和信染厂新装轧光机，并拟增加印花设备，若能广泛推行，印花布成本即可降低，布匹经过轧光，质量也可提高。
    其次为铁工业，石市土造广锅及阳泉土锅，战前销路很广，南沿平汉路直过黄河，东到渤海一带，北可销到关外。这些市场在战争期间，已多年失去联系，最近公营铁货业曾分别派员往各地调查，且已逐步打开销路，待年内平汉路修复，销路即可展开。铁业的另一种主要的生产品是水车，各厂都是承包华北水利推进社订货，该社石市分社所属一市八县，按华北五年到七年发展水利计划，水车在数年之内还有推广的必要。而石市水车生产技术落后，每月生产达四百辆合乎标准的不过二百辆。该社现正帮助各厂研究改进技术，并已初步实行各厂分工制造。
    根据以上两个主要私营工业经营情况，已经证明，平津解放后，全市私营工业是有发展前途的。今后为了加速全市工业建设，必须加强领导，有计划地进行改进：
    第一，合资经营，改良工具，石市私营工业，多是小规模的手工业及独立劳动者，资本很小，设备简陋，如织布业一般只有三、四张木机，流动资金不过十几捆纱，电磨机最大的十五马力的电动机设备的只有几家，肥皂业五十多家，一般每天出产肥皂不过一千块左右。如织布业添设一部五马力电动机即需三十捆纱，因此除由银行贷一部分外，主要是靠各厂合资经营。
    第二，成立各业供销社，首先是解决远地推销问题，这已是目前迫不及待的问题，而单独一家来做是很困难的，最近针织业试办联合运销，先以七家结成一个运销小组，到榆次卖了一百多打袜子，成绩很好，织布业中也有类似做法。如此不但解决销路问题，而且可以集体采购原料当然还得经常与国营贸易公司密切联系，才能有更好成绩。
    第三，减低原料成本，石市虽接近棉、煤、铁产区，但因冶铁纺纱技术较平津、冀南各地落后，产品成本高，质量又次，无法与之竞争。如大兴纱厂的二十支纱质量较差，在石市销路不利，而冀南和村纱则经常供不应求；假使大兴的纱能减低成本卖价便宜些，对发展织布业还会更有利些。其他铁业等原料占成本绝大部分，公营企业掌握这些生产原料！应该根据产品质量随一般价格确定适当利润，否则对某些生产发展是不利的。
    第四，实行劳资两利团结生产，石市工业因多是手工作坊，劳资关系还存着一些封建的性质，如织布、电磨、铁工业一般工作时间都在十二小时以上。有些资方唯恐掌握不住工人，多利用亲戚本家来作工；这种封建关系影响生产情绪，而且妨碍合资经营的组织，因而必须建立正常的工作制度，适当照顾工人生活，团结发展生产。
    最近石市又新设了火柴厂、长芦食盐公司；大规模的打蛋厂、被服厂、轧花厂、土生公司正在积极筹备。这些工厂、公司的成立将首先解决失业问题，并使许多市民和农民转入工业生产，劳动人民生活将普遍得到改善，因此石市工商业不是萧条，而是开始迈向发展的大道，这发展是随着整个革命形势发展向前推进的。
