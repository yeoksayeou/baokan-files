Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th. The CCP Fushun Municipal Committee has called for a further expansion of the thrift campaign, making thrift the most important item in the production competition. The mine has achieved remarkable results in practicing thrift over the past six months. For example, from early March to early April, more than 27,000 employees collected and contributed more than 240,000 pieces of equipment, worth 7 billion Northeast currency (hereinafter the same). More than 8,000 employees collected more than 4,800 tons of steel, worth 52.9 billion. The mine hospital produced its own medicines and saved medical equipment, also reaching 6.8 billion. Furthermore, the self-made pipe cleaner by the workers of the oil refinery replaced foreign goods, and the successful trial production of hexagonal hollow steel by the steel plant saved 14 tons of nickel, which is of great significance to Fushun and all the mines in Northeast China. All mines and factories have also saved on water, electricity, coal, and oil. However, in the past six months, there have been many wasteful phenomena in other aspects of the mining area, especially the waste caused by poor management. For example, construction lacks a definite plan and starts blindly, resulting in wasted labor, materials, and time, and low construction efficiency, failing to maximize the use of human, material, and financial resources. Furthermore, in the management of raw materials, the system is chaotic, without strict budget and management procedures, and many departments have a phenomenon of random receiving, using, and wasting, failing to scientifically use existing materials, resulting in the failure to supply materials urgently needed for construction and production in a timely manner. Labor waste is also quite serious; after adjustment, a total of more than 4,400 non-direct production personnel were transferred, of which 430 were old, weak, and disabled, and the rest are being turned to direct production or given appropriate work. The CCP Fushun Municipal Committee pointed out in its call that it is necessary to further develop the thrift campaign and overcome the above-mentioned serious waste of state property. The CCP Party Committee, the administration, and the trade union should include the issue of thrift as a course of study for in-service cadres and training courses. All enterprises and institutions should, according to the specific circumstances and ideological conditions of their units, conduct in-depth thrift mobilization at cadre meetings, mass meetings, and employee representative meetings. In business management, resolutely implement the enterprise-oriented policy, strengthen business management, have an overall plan, unified system, and strictly establish and implement the budget and quota, quota, and quality system, truly reducing costs and increasing output and quality. The Municipal Committee also emphasized in its call to strengthen the mass anti-espionage and security work, fire prevention work, and implement regular security inspections; at the same time, pay attention to improving the technical level and work responsibility of employees, implement a responsibility system and reward and punishment system, to effectively prevent and reduce losses from accidents.

　　中共抚顺市委号召各矿厂
  　进一步开展节约
    【新华社沈阳五日电】中共抚顺市委会号召进一步开展节约运动，并在生产竞赛运动中，把节约列为最主要的项目。该矿半年来在厉行节约上已获有显著的成绩，如三月初到四月初一个月内，二万七千职工共搜集和献出了二十四万多件器材，价值达东北币（下同）七十亿元。八千多职工搜集的钢铁达四千八百余吨，价值五百二十九亿元。矿山医院自制药品和节约医药器材，亦达六十八亿元。再如制油厂工人自制洗管器，代替外货，制钢厂试制六角中空钢成功，节约十四吨镍等，对抚顺和全东北矿山都具有重大的意义。各矿厂对水、电、煤、油亦均有节约。但该矿区半年来在其他方面尚有很多浪费现象特别是经营管理不善而造成的浪费较为严重。如在修建上缺乏确切的计划，盲目动工，以致费工、费料、费时，修建效率不高，人力、物力、财力不能发挥到应有的高度。又如在原料、材料的管理上，制度混乱，没有严格的预决算制度和管理手续，不少部门存在着随便领、随便用、随便浪费的现象，未能科学地使用现有材料，致修建和生产所急需的材料不能及时供应。劳动力浪费亦相当严重；经过调整后，共抽调出非直接生产人员有四千四百余人，其中除四百三十人为老弱残废者外，其余正在使之转向直接生产或给以适当工作。中共抚顺市委会在号召中指出，必须进一步开展节约运动，克服上述对国家财产不负责任的严重浪费现象。中共党委、行政、职工会应把节约问题作为在职干部与训练班的学习课程。各企业单位应根据本单位具体情况与思想情况，在干部大会、群众大会、职工代表会上作深入的节约动员。在经营管理上坚决贯彻企业化方针，加强业务管理，要有全盘计划，统一制度，严格建立并执行预决算和定量、定额、定质的制度，真正作到减低成本和提高产量、质量。市委会在号召中并强调加强群众性的除奸保安工作、防火工作，实行定期的保安检查；同时注意提高职工的技术水平和工作责任心，实行负责制和奖罚制，以切实预防和减少意外事故的损失。
