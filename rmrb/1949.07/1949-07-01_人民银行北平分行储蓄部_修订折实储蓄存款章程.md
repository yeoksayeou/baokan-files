　　People's Bank of Peiping Branch Savings Department
  　Revises Regulations for Discount Savings Deposits
    [This Dispatch] To meet the needs of the people and promote savings business, the Savings Department of the People's Bank of Peiping Branch, in accordance with the Savings Deposit Regulations issued by the Head Office, has revised the terms, interest rates, and other parts of the current Provisional Savings Deposit Regulations, which will be implemented starting from July 1st. However, for all accounts deposited before this revision of the regulations, the interest rate will still be handled according to the original method. The revised points are as follows:
    1. Deposit Term—The old regulations only stipulated three terms for deposits: three months, six months, and one year. The current regulations have been relaxed and revised to: (1) Fixed Deposit: A minimum of three months up to one year, in monthly increments (i.e., three months, four months... up to one year are all acceptable), allowing depositors to choose freely. (2) The deposit terms for interest-bearing deposits, regular savings deposits, and fixed withdrawal deposits are all from a minimum of six months to one year, in monthly increments.
    2. Interest Rate—Calculated on a monthly basis, the minimum interest rate is 3%. For each additional month of deposit term, the interest rate increases by one level (0.5% per level). However, to encourage long-term savings, a super-progressive increase method is adopted. For example: (1) Fixed Deposit: 3% for three months, 3.5% for four months, 4% for five months, 5% for six months... (2) Interest-bearing deposits, regular savings deposits, and fixed withdrawal deposits: 3% for six months, 3.5% for seven months, 4% for eight months, 5% for nine months...
    3. For early withdrawals of fixed deposits, regular savings deposits, and fixed withdrawal deposits, the interest rate for deposits of three months or more should be discounted and paid according to the actual number of months deposited, based on the interest rate stipulated for fixed deposits.
    4. The method for depositors to apply for renewal upon maturity is the same as before, but applications can also be made by letter. The original deposit slip should be enclosed with the original seal affixed for verification. The bank will process the renewal based on the date of receipt of the letter.
    5. Relaxing the number of units deposited each time for regular savings deposits—According to the old regulations, the number of units deposited each time was fixed and could not be increased or decreased. To facilitate depositors, this restriction has been removed, and the number of units deposited each time is now a minimum of one unit, with no limit to the maximum. However, the number of units deposited each time in the last month must not exceed the average of the total number of units deposited in all previous instances.
    6. If there is a suspension of deposits in the middle of a regular savings deposit, the interest will be calculated at 80% of the original interest rate.
    7. Regular savings deposits can be renewed five days before the expiration date, calculated at the exchange rate on the date of receipt. If payment is delayed, and prices rise, it will be calculated at the exchange rate on the date of deposit; if prices fall, it will still be calculated at the original exchange rate on the date of deposit. Delays exceeding five days will still be considered a single interruption, and interest will be calculated at 90% of the original interest rate.
    8. The amount of fixed deposits has been changed to a minimum of 20 or more standard physical units (originally 24), with no limit to the maximum, but it should be divisible on average.

　　人民银行北平分行储蓄部
  　修订折实储蓄存款章程
    【本报讯】人民银行北平分行储蓄部为适应人民需要，推广储蓄业务，特遵照总行颁发之储蓄存款章程，将现行之储蓄存款暂行章程中之期限、利率等部分予以修正，自七月一日起开始施行。但凡在此次修改章程以前存入各户，其利率仍按原定办法办理。经过修改各点如下：
    一、存款期限——旧章程内对于存款期限，只规定为三个月、半年及一年三种。现将原规定期限放宽修改为：（１）整存整付：三个月起码至一年为止，以月为单位（即三个月、四个月……以迄一年均可），任存户自择。（２）存本付息、零存整付、整存零付三种的存款期限，均自半年起码至一年为止，以月为单位。
    二、利率—按月息计算，最低利率为三厘。存款期限每增一个月，利率即增一级（五毫为一级）。但为鼓励长时期储蓄计，采超级递增办法。例如：（１）整存整付，三个月三厘，四个月三厘五，五个月四厘，六个月五厘……。（２）存本付息、零存整付及整存零付三种：六个月三厘，七个月三厘五，八个月四厘，九个月五厘……。
    三、整存整付、零存整付及整存零付三种之提前支取时，关于存满三个月以上之利率，应依据其实存月数，照整存整付所规定利率折扣付给。
    四、存款期满，存户申请转期办法与以前相同，但亦可用函件申请，须将原存单折加盖原印鉴，附寄以凭办理。本行办理转期，以收到函件之日为准。
    五、放宽零存整付存款每次存入单位个数——依照旧章程每次存入之单位个数系固定的不能增减。兹为便利存户起见，特将此项限制取消，改为每次存入以一个单位起码，多者不限，但最后一个月内每次存入之单位数，不得超过已存各次单位总和之平均数。
    六、零存整付存款，如有中途停存情形，其利息按原定利率八折计算。
    七、零存整付存款可于期前五日预先办理续存手续，按收存当日牌价计算。逾期迟交如物价上涨，按存交日牌价计算，物价下落，则仍按原定存交日牌价计算。迟交逾五日以上，仍视为间断一次，利息照原定利率九折计算。
    八、整存整付之存款额，改以二十个以上标准实物单位起码（原为二十四个），多者不限，但以能平均分取为准。
