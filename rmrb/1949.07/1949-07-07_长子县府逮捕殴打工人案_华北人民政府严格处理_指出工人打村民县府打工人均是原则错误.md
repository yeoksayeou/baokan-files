Changzi County Government Arrests and Assaults Workers
  North China People's Government Handles the Case Strictly
    Points Out that Workers Beating Villagers and the County Government Beating Workers are Both Errors in Principle
    [This newspaper's special dispatch] The North China People's Government has attached great importance to the case of the Changzi County Government's armed arrest and assault of workers at the carpentry section of the fourth branch of a certain factory, which occurred in January of this year. After instructing the Public-operated Enterprise Department and the Taiyue Administrative Office to investigate and report separately, it has now decided on the handling method and ordered the Public-operated Enterprise Department and the Taiyue Administrative Office to comply.
    The case concerns the fact that the office of the carpentry section of a certain factory was located at the home of Zhang Xianhua, a village woman in Luojiagou Zhang Village. The woman was having an affair with her husband's elder brother, Li Fuzhe. After the office moved in, she also had a relationship with Chen Xifu, the head of the office, and also had ambiguous relations with worker Kang Guicheng. Thus, they became jealous of each other and sought trouble. On the night of January 1 this year, Kang Guicheng notified the village chief, claiming that fifteen catties of meat had been stolen and that Li Fuzhe was responsible. The next evening, he again sought the village chief to tie up Li Fuzhe, but the village chief refused. After Kang left, Chen Xifu also sought the village chief, claiming that twenty catties of meat had been stolen and that Li Fuzhe had been inside the courtyard, and that he should be detained. When they went to Li Fuzhe's house together, Kang Guicheng and others tied up Li Fuzhe and took him to the workers' residence, interrogated him behind closed doors, and transported him to Mocun overnight, tying him up along the way. After arriving at Mocun, he was tied to a pillar and whipped with a leather belt, and interrogated by Li Guizhi, the head of the factory in Mocun. Li finally confessed to stealing the meat under duress. He was released back to the village on the afternoon of the 4th. On the 5th, Li Fuzhe reported the matter to the district and also filed a complaint with the county. After the county government summoned him, Kang Guicheng did not arrive. The next day, bailiffs were sent to summon him again, and Kang Guicheng was tied up to the village office. The workers then snatched Kang back. After receiving the report, the county government ordered Tian Juncai, the secretary of the county government, Zhao Yuxiu, the deputy director of the Armed Committee, and the secretary of the Public Security Bureau, to lead more than 30 public security team members and militiamen to Luojiagou. They surrounded the factory in the middle of the night, entered the courtyard by climbing over the wall, searched and arrested thirteen workers, and beat and tied up twenty-one people, injuring them, and one person had his fingers frostbitten and disabled. They also took some money and belongings from the workers, and the factory was shut down for several days as a result. The workers were also put in shackles and handcuffs while in custody. When Liang Kui, a special commissioner from the factory, investigated the situation and went to the county to talk to County Chief Liang Xuanxian and Secretary Tian Juncai about the matter, Liang and Tian both had a very tough attitude and no results were achieved. Later, the factory sent someone to negotiate with the Prefectural Committee, and Political Commissar Liu called the County Committee, and only then were the workers' shackles removed and they were released one after another.
    Based on the facts of the case, the North China People's Government pointed out that both sides had committed errors in principle:
    1.  The carpentry section of the fourth branch of the factory is a state-owned production department, and it cannot replace the government, nor does it have any special privileges. However, the factory workers, because of the loss of meat during the New Year (whether it was lost has not yet been clarified), actually tied up, beat, and interrogated villager Li Fuzhe without going through the government. When the county government summoned worker Kang Guicheng, Kang Guicheng refused to obey. The second time to summon the case, the factory gathered many people and forcibly snatched Kang Guicheng from the bailiffs, refusing to appear in court. And in connection with the fact that the factory usually has acts that harm the interests of the masses, such as destroying temple doors and stoves, randomly cutting down trees, not returning borrowed items, and not compensating for damaged items, this should not be regarded as a general "violation of mass discipline," but as a serious manifestation of anarchism and lack of discipline. A serious attitude must be taken towards these errors, and we must not take them lightly, and we must not accommodate and encourage the backward gang consciousness of some individuals, and allow them to overstep their powers and violate policies.
    2.  The village chief stationed in the village by the factory did not agree with the factory's detention and interrogation of villager Li Fuzhe, which was correct. The Changzi County Government's summons of worker Kang Guicheng was also correct. This is the authority that the government should have and the attitude it should take. However, when the secretary of the county government and others encountered the factory workers' disobedience and refusal to hand over worker Kang Guicheng, they failed to maintain a clear-headed attitude and calmly handle the problem. Instead of consulting with the factory leaders and the trade union to resolve the issue in a timely manner, they acted impulsively and hastily, surrounded the factory with armed forces at night, entered the courtyard by climbing over the wall, and indiscriminately arrested and beat workers, resulting in as many as eighty-four people being arrested, beaten, injured, frostbitten, and frightened away. They also took some money and belongings from the workers. This is obviously a serious error. Its essence is a working method that does not rely on the working class, does not take care of all parties, and does not follow the mass line. This is also an error of principle, which will not only fail to solve the problem, but will also deepen mutual contradictions and disputes.
    As for the handling of this issue by the local leaders, they adopted a sloppy attitude; the reports of Shen Dingxiang, Chen Haiqing, and Zhang Ziying of the factory only blamed others and lacked the spirit of self-examination, which is wrong. In order to distinguish right from wrong ideologically, the factory and the government should re-examine the errors mentioned above in order to raise awareness and enhance unity.
    In addition to approving the methods agreed upon by both parties in handling this case: (1) compensation for the wages of injured employees; (2) compensation for the workers' lost items; (3) resolution of the medical expenses required by disabled and injured personnel, and settlement of living expenses; (4) County Government Secretary Tian Juncai is dismissed from his post and apologizes to the workers for admitting his mistake, and the police and public security team members who beat people are confined to a closed room for more than a month for education, and the remaining personnel examine their mistakes and receive criticism and disciplinary action, etc., the North China People's Government makes the following supplementary treatments: (1) County Chief Liang Xuanxian failed to negotiate with the factory to resolve the dispute and took improper measures, and should be criticized. (2) Zhao Yuxiu, the deputy director of the Armed Committee, and the secretary of the Public Security Bureau, failed to properly control their subordinates and allowed them to arbitrarily arrest and beat workers and take away some money and belongings, and should be given a warning. (3) Shen Dingxiang, Chen Haiqing, and Zhang Ziying, the persons in charge of the factory, usually neglected inspection and management of the factory, resulting in repeated incidents. After this case occurred, they failed to humbly conduct self-examination and blamed others, and should be criticized by the Enterprise Department. (4) Kang Guicheng, the foreman, tied up and beat villagers and resisted government orders, which is illegal and should be punished by law. However, because he has been detained by the county government for many days, he will be exempted from punishment for the time being, but should be given a warning. In addition, in order to educate the factory to respect the government and improve the relationship between the factory and the masses in the village, the factory should convene a village meeting together with the government, and the factory should apologize to the villagers for admitting its mistakes in order to improve relations and enhance unity.

　　长子县府逮捕殴打工人案
  　华北人民政府严格处理
    指出工人打村民县府打工人均是原则错误
    【本报特讯】今年一月间发生的长子县政府武装逮捕殴打某厂四分厂木工部工人一案，华北人民政府十分重视，经令公营企业部及太岳行政公署分别调查具复后，现已决定处理办法，令饬公营企业部及太岳行政公署遵照办理。
    按该案因系某厂木工部事务处设于罗家沟张村村妇张鲜花家，该妇与其夫伯兄李福则通奸。自事务处迁入后，又与事务长陈喜福发生男女关系，与工人康贵成亦有暖昧，于是因互相忌妒各找事端。今年一月一日夜康贵成通知村长借口被窃去肉十五斤，说是李福则所为。次日晚又找村长欲捆李福则，村长未允。康走后陈喜福又找村长，谓窃去肉二十斤，以李福则曾去院内，须前往扣押。及相随找至李福则家，康贵成等即将李福则捆至工人住地，闭门审问，并漏夜解往末村，沿途背砖捆绑。至末村后又复捆在柱上用皮带抽打，并由末村工厂负责人李贵芝审问，李终在胁迫下承认偷肉。四日下午释放回村。五日李福则将此事报告到区又控告到县。经县政府传讯，康贵成未到。次日又派法警传讯，将康贵成捆至村公所后，工人又将康抢回。县政府得报后，即命县政府秘书田俊才，武委会副主任赵玉秀，公安局秘书等带领公安队员民兵三十多人，往罗家沟，深夜包围工厂，越墙入院，搜捕工人十三名，并殴打捆绑成伤二十一人，及冻坏手指残废者一人，且拿工人一部钱物，工厂因此停工数日。工人在扣押时还带上脚镣手铐等刑具。及该厂特派员梁奎调查情况到县，与梁县长选贤，田秘书俊才谈此事时，梁田二人态度均甚强硬，未得结果。嗣经该厂再派人与一地委交涉，由刘政委打电话到县委，才给工人卸下刑具，陆续释放。
    华北人民政府根据此案事实，指出双方均犯有原则错误：
    一、该厂四分厂木工部是国家一个生产部门，不能代替政府，也无任何特权，而该厂工人竟因年节丢肉（丢否尚未弄清），竟不经政府，擅自捆打、审讯村民李福则，及至县府传讯工长康贵成时，康贵成抗命不到，第二次去传案，工厂竟聚集多人硬从法警手中将康贵成夺去，拒不到案，以及该厂平时即有损害群众利益行为，如破坏庙门和火炉、乱砍树木、借东西不还、损坏东西不赔等事实联系起来看，这绝不能只认为是一般的“违犯群众纪律”，而应视为严重的无政府无纪律状态的表现，对这些错误，必须采取严肃态度，不能轻轻了事，不能迁就助长某些个别人们的落后行帮意识，任其逾越职权违反政策。
    二、该工厂驻村村长不同意工厂拘讯村民李福则，是对的，长子县府传讯工长康贵成，也是对的，这是政府应有的职权与应采取的态度。但该县府秘书等遇到该厂工人抗命不交出工长康贵成时，未能保持清醒态度，冷静处理问题，不即时与工厂领导上和工会协商解决，反而感情冲动，草率从事，夜间武装包围工厂，越墙入院，滥行逮捕、殴打工人，致被捕、被打、被伤、冻病与吓跑者，达八十四名之多，并拿去工人一部钱物，这显然是严重的错误行动，其实质就是不依靠工人阶级，不照顾各方关系，不走群众路线的工作方式，这也是原则的错误，不但不能解决问题，反而会加深相互矛盾与纠纷。
    至当地领导上对这一问题的处理，采取马虎了事的态度；该厂沈丁祥、陈海清、张子英的报告只责备他人，缺乏自我检讨的精神，都是不对的，为从思想上分清是非界限，对上指错误，工厂与政府均应重新加以检讨，以提高认识，增强团结。
    华北人民政府对本案的处理，除批准双方所议定的办法：（一）赔偿伤员工资；（二）赔偿工人损失的东西；（三）解决残废伤员所需之医药费，安置生活费；（四）县府秘书田俊才撤职，并向工人道歉认错，打人法警及公安队员住禁闭室月余教育，其余人员检讨错误，受到批评处分等外，并作如下之补充处理：（一）县长梁选贤不能与工厂协商解决纠纷，措置失当，应予批评。（二）武委会副主任赵玉秀、公安局秘书不能很好的掌握部属，任其肆行捕打工人，并取去一部钱物应予以警告处分。（三）该厂负责人沈丁祥、陈海清、张子英平时对工厂疏于检查管理，致屡生事端，本案发生后，不能虚心自我检讨，一味指责别人，应由企业部给予批评。（四）工长康贵成捆打村民，抗拒政府命令，这是违法行为，应受到法律制裁，惟因其已由县府扣押多日，姑免处刑，但应予警告。此外，为着教育工厂，尊重政权，并改善工厂与驻村群众关系，应由工厂会同政府召集村民大会，工厂向村民认错道歉，以改善关系，增强团结。　　　　　（常）
