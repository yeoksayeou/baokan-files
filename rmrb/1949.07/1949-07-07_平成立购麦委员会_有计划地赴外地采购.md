　　Peiping Establishes Wheat Purchasing Committee
　　Has a Plan to Purchase from Other Areas
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Peiping Municipal Wheat Purchasing Committee was established yesterday morning (the 6th). Under the leadership of the Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, it will immediately organize grain merchants to purchase wheat from other areas in an organized and planned manner to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and to avoid blind competition that could stimulate price fluctuations. This organization, after several days of deliberation, convened a meeting yesterday morning at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce auditorium with representatives from the rice and flour industry, grain depot industry, and mechanized milling industry to discuss the matter. More than seventy representatives attended the meeting. All comrades agreed to purchase wheat from other areas in a unified manner and unanimously agreed to establish a wheat purchasing committee on the spot to be responsible for contacting various places to solve difficulties in purchasing and technical issues in wheat purchasing. It was also decided to implement a unified purchasing, local distribution, unified transportation, and free sale method. All grain merchants in the city can voluntarily join the purchasing committee at any time; the amount of funds, the selection of markets, and the participation of groups are all determined by the grain merchants themselves. After purchasing wheat, the wheat will be distributed locally in proportion to the amount of investment, and railway cars will be allocated in proportion to the amount of wheat purchased, but three rules must be observed: (1) When purchasing, prices must be jointly negotiated with the local government, taking into account the interests of all parties, and a reasonable price must be agreed upon; (2) It must be guaranteed that the purchased wheat will be transported to Peiping for sale; (3) Local government laws and regulations must be observed, and speculation must not be engaged in.
　　The Wheat Purchasing Committee is composed of nine members. In addition to two members from the Trading Company and one from the Cooperative, the rice and flour industry, grain depot industry, and mechanized milling industry each have two participants. Six representatives from each industry were elected on the spot to be members of the Wheat Purchasing Committee. The Trading Company sent Shi Jiuyan (manager of the Grain Company) and Li Qingshu (head of the Operations Section), and one member from the Cooperative (yet to be determined) to participate as members.

　　平成立购麦委员会
  　有计划地赴外地采购
    【本报讯】北平市购麦委员会昨（六日）上午成立，在人民政府工商局领导下，即着手组织粮商有组织有计划地外出采购小麦，以促进城乡物资交流，并可避免发生盲目争购现象而刺激物价之波动。此组织经多日之酝酿，于昨日上午假市商会大礼堂召集米面粮业、粮栈业及机制粉业代表开会商讨。到会七十余代表，全体同志统一外出采购小麦，并一致赞成当场成立购麦委员会，以负责与各地联络解决采购上的困难及购麦上之技术问题。并决定了统一采购，就地分配，统一运输，自由贩卖的办法。凡全市粮商均可随时自愿加入采购委员会；关于资金之数量及市场之选择，小组之参加，均由粮商自行决定。购到麦后，就地按出资数目比例分配小麦，按购到麦之数目比例分配车皮，但必须遵守三项守则：（一）采购时要与当地政府共同议价，照顾到各方面的利益，议定合理价格；（二）保证将购到之麦运到北平出售；（三）要遵守当地政府法令，不得投机取巧。
    购麦委员会系由委员九人组成，内除贸易公司二人，合作社一人外，米面粮业，粮栈业，机制粉业各有二人参加，当场推选出各业代表六人为购麦委员会委员。贸易公司派石九言（粮食公司经理）、李庆书（经营科长），合作社一人（尚未定）参加为委员。
