    At the North China Agricultural Production Conference
    Chairman Dong Biwu Delivers Report
    Explaining the Path of Agricultural Development
    [This newspaper reports] Chairman Dong of the North China People's Government delivered a detailed report at the North China Agricultural Production Conference on the 18th. He began by analyzing the domestic and international situations. He said that domestically, the Chinese people's democratic revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism has achieved basic victory, and nationwide victory is coming soon. Internationally, the forces of peace and democracy led by the Soviet Union are growing stronger, especially the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, which has greatly strengthened the forces of the world's peace and democracy camp. Conversely, the aggressive forces led by US imperialism, because their economic crisis is showing signs of eruption, and the economic contradictions between Britain and the United States are becoming increasingly serious, weakening the forces against the peace and democracy camp. He then said that in the situation where national victory is about to come, our future task is to carry out peaceful construction, especially economic construction. As far as China's current economic situation is concerned, modern industry accounts for only 10 percent of the total national economy, while agriculture and small handicrafts account for 90 percent. In the future, China's economy must be industrialized, and in order to ensure becoming an industrialized country, it must develop heavy industry. At present, the main task is to restore industry, agriculture, transportation, and other industries. Subsequently, he talked about the interrelationship between the development of industry and agriculture. He said that to make agriculture highly developed, it is necessary to mechanize and electrify agriculture, but to achieve this, it is necessary to rely on the development of industry. Similarly, industrial production also needs agriculture to supply food and raw materials. In the future, the development of agriculture must also have political guarantees, so that agricultural production can be collectivized, and farmers can embark on the road of socialism to achieve complete liberation. Agricultural collectivization is the most sound path for agricultural development. Finally, he pointed out that to improve agricultural production, it is necessary to use science. Comrades engaged in agricultural science work should not only teach farmers scientific knowledge and technology, but also humbly learn from farmers, analyze and synthesize farmers' practical knowledge, so that farmers can closely integrate scientific knowledge with their practical experience.

    华北农业生产会议上
    董必武主席作报告
    说明农业发展的道路
    【本报讯】华北人民政府董主席于十八日出席华北农业生产会议，作了详细报告。他首先分析了国内与国际的形势，他说：在国内，中国人民反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的人民民主革命已经取得了基本的胜利，全国范围内的胜利也很快就要到来；国际方面，以苏联为首的和平民主的力量日趋壮大，尤其是中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利，更大大地加强了全世界和平民主阵营的力量，相反地，以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力，因其经济危机已有爆发的象征，英美经济矛盾日渐严重，削弱着反和平民主阵营的力量。接着他说，在全国胜利就要到来的形势下，我们今后的任务是进行和平建设，特别是经济建设。就目前中国的经济情况来讲，近代化的工业只占全部国民经济的百分之十，农业和小手工业占了百分之九十，将来中国的经济必须工业化，而且为了保证成为一个工业国，必须发展重工业，目前主要是恢复工业和农业交通业等。随后他说到发展工业与农业的相互关系，他说要使农业高度发展，非使农业机械化和电气化不可，但要作到这一步，便必须依靠工业的发展；同样工业生产也要农业供给食粮和原料。将来农业的发展，还要有政治上的保障，使农业生产合作化，农民走上社会主义的路才能得到彻底的解放。农业必须合作化，才是农业发展最健全的道路。最后他指出，要使农业生产提高，必须运用科学，从事农业科学工作的同志应一方面教农民以科学知识与技术，同时应虚心向农民学习，分析综合农民的实际知识，使农民能够把科学知识与其实际经验密切地结合起来。
