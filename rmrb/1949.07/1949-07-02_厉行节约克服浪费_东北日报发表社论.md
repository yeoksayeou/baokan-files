Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. The Northeast Daily published an editorial on the 24th of last month regarding the issue of thrift. It demanded that the Northeast Party and government leading organs, as well as the staff and workers of various enterprises, pay serious attention to and quickly overcome the phenomena of waste existing in industrial production. It called for implementing a strict system of thrift, so that the nation's funds and materials can be truly invested in the most pressing and urgent construction projects, in order to fully utilize their effectiveness. The editorial listed five types of waste currently existing in recovery and construction: First, waste of raw materials. For example, there are no standards for the use of raw materials; people take them and use them casually, using finished materials as waste materials, and using large materials as small materials, only caring about the present and not the future; or only caring about the local interests of their own enterprise or unit, and not caring about the overall interests of the country. For example, some units do not inspect warehouse conditions; they still request materials from higher-level organs even though they have large stocks. Some pile up the raw materials they don't need in the warehouse, not letting others know, which makes it impossible for the country to carry out unified allocation of raw materials to ensure the needs of all parties. Second, waste of funds. Many personnel submit budgets that exceed actual needs; when using funds, they do not distinguish between what is important and urgent. For example, after receiving factory construction funds, they do not repair the factory buildings but instead repair offices, clubs, etc. Some construction is carried out without standards or inspection; it is built today and needs to be repaired tomorrow. Some even use the construction funds to solve other uses of the unit. Third, waste of finished products. For example, during production competitions, they only seek to exceed the planned quantity and do not pay attention to whether the quality meets the standards. Fourth, waste of labor power, with the proportion of indirect production personnel and non-production personnel being too large. Many factories retain the large administrative structure from their rural period after moving into the city. Some factories do not directly recruit skilled workers, but instead recruit a large number of apprentices. Some factories want to increase production, but do not first think about improving labor technology and efficiency, but only think about adding workers. Fifth, accidental losses are caused by a lack of a sense of responsibility, such as fires, car crashes, etc. The editorial analyzes the reasons for the above-mentioned serious waste, and points out that in addition to some objective conditions, the main reason is that some enterprise managers do not have a strong sense of responsibility for the people's cause, and have parochialism and manage modern industry with the methods of the countryside. They seek convenience, are afraid of trouble, do not pay attention to economic accounting, and are not good at making scientific plans; they have no idea what is going on. They lack the idea of ​​unified concentration, lack an overall concept, and are unwilling or not good at working under a unified plan; and they do not see the losses to the country caused by only caring about local interests. In order to effectively overcome the phenomenon of waste in economic construction, the editorial proposes: it is necessary to carry out regular and extensive mass movements against waste, and to establish a new moral concept among the broad masses of the people – wasting state property is shameful, while saving state property is supremely glorious. In production management, implement an economic accounting system and resolutely break the bad habit of not using the abacus when doing economic work. The editorial emphasizes that it is necessary to establish the necessary systems in production management; otherwise, opposing waste and practicing thrift will become empty talk.

### 厉行节约克服浪费　东北日报发表社论

　　厉行节约克服浪费
  　东北日报发表社论
    【新华社沈阳一日电】东北日报于上月二十四日就节约问题发表社论，要求东北党政领导机关及各企业职工，严重注意并迅速克服在工业生产中存在的浪费现象，实行严格的节约制度，使国家的资金与物力，真正投入最迫切最紧急的建设事业方面，以充分发挥其效能。社论列举目前恢复建设中存在的浪费现象有五种：一是原料材料的浪费。如使用原料材料没有标准，随便领，随便用，把成材当废材用，把大材当小材用，只顾目前不顾将来；或者只顾本企业本单位的局部利益，不顾国家的整体利益。如有的单位不检查仓库情况，本来有大批储存，仍向上级机关去领；有的把自己用不着的原料材料堆在仓库里，不让别人知道，这样就无法使国家进行原料材料的统一调度，以保证各方面的需要。二是资金的浪费。不少人员提出预算时超过实际需要；使用时又不分轻重缓急。比如领到工厂修建费，不修厂所，而去修办公室、俱乐部等。有的修建时，无标准，不检查，今天建筑起来，明天就要修理。有的甚至拿到建筑费后用来解决本单位的其他用途。三是生产成品的浪费。如在生产竞赛时，只求数量超过计划，不注意质量是否合乎标准。四是劳动力的浪费，间接生产人员和非生产人员所占比重过大。不少工厂搬进城市后，还保留农村时期的庞大事务机构。有的工厂不直接招收熟练工人，而去招收大批学徒。有的工厂要增加生产，不是首先从提高劳动技术与效率上着想，而只从加添工人上着想。五是由于责任心不强招致意外损失，如失火、撞车等。社论分析造成上述严重浪费的原因，除了若干客观条件以外，主要地是有些企业管理人员对人民事业的责任心不强，存在本位主义，和以农村的一套来管理近代化的工业。他们图简便、怕麻烦，不讲求经济核算，不善作科学计划，心中无数。他们缺乏统一集中的思想，缺乏整体观念，不愿意或不善于在统一的计划下来进行工作；而看不到因为只顾局部利益而造成的国家的损失。为了切实有效地克服经济建设中的浪费现象，社论提出：必须开展经常的广泛的反对浪费的群众运动，要在广大人民中树立一种新道德观念——浪费国家财产是可耻的，而节省国家财产则是无上光荣。在生产管理上，实行经济核算制度，坚决打破作经济工作而不打算盘的恶劣作风。社论强调必须在生产管理上建立必要的制度，否则反对浪费，厉行节约，就会成为空谈。
