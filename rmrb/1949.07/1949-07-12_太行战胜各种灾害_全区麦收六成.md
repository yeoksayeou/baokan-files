　　Taihang
  　Overcomes Various Disasters
  　60% of Wheat Harvested in the Region
    ▲This year, the Taihang region has over 9.1 million mu of wheat fields. Due to little snow last winter and lack of rain this spring, as well as severe frost, pests, and hail, the people of the region united and fought to overcome these disasters. The region still managed to harvest 60% of the wheat crop. Preliminary estimates show: the first district averaged 4 *dou* (市斗, a Chinese dry measure, same below) of wheat per mu, the second district averaged 3.5 *dou*, the third district averaged 5.2 *dou*, and the fourth district averaged 6 *dou*. The average wheat yield for the entire region is approximately 60% of a normal year.
    ▲The Military Region's People's Armed Forces Department recently convened a meeting of deputy directors from various sub-districts to determine the new tasks for the People's Armed Forces under the new circumstances. It was determined that the current basic tasks should be: 1. Eliminate all remaining bandits and stabilize social order. 2. Protect factories, warehouses, and various production and construction projects. 3. Protect railways, power lines, and bridges. 4. Suppress the destructive activities of secret societies. 5. Strictly prevent theft and robbery.

　　太行
  　战胜各种灾害
  　全区麦收六成
    ▲太行全区今年共有麦田九百一十万余亩，因去冬少雪，今春缺雨，及遭受了严重的冻灾、虫害、雹灾，由于全区人民团结奋斗，战胜各种灾害，全区麦收仍达六成。据初步估计：一专区每亩平均收麦四斗（市斗，下同），二专区平均三斗半，三专区平均五斗二，四专区平均六斗，全区小麦年成平均约六成左右。
    ▲军区人民武装部近召集各分区副部长会议，确定在新形势下人民武装工作的新任务，确定当前基本任务应是：一、肃清一切残匪，安定社会秩序。二、保护工厂、仓库及各种生产建设。三、保护铁路、电线、桥梁。四、取缔会道门的破坏活动。五、严防盗劫。
