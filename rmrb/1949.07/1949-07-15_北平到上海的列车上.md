　　On the Train from Beiping to Shanghai
　　By our reporter Lù Hào
　　The first train from Beiping to Shanghai on July 10th carried 555 passengers. Each person had their own reasons for their happiness.
　　That old lady with snow-white hair was going to Shanghai to meet her daughter and son-in-law, from whom she had been separated for eight years; this middle-aged woman in blue drill cloth was going to Shanghai to see her long-separated mother. The opening of the Beiping-Shanghai line has shortened the distance between Beiping and Shanghai, which are 1,496 kilometers apart, allowing those who have been separated to reunite, and the exchange of materials between the North and South will no longer be separated by the natural barriers of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers.
　　As the train traveled from Beiping to Tianjin, it rained continuously outside the window, but the passengers were in high spirits. Ma Qianli, the director of the privately-owned Mentougou Victory Coal Mine, was going to Shanghai to handle the issue of transporting coal from the mine to the south. The railway bureau had already agreed to help them solve transportation difficulties. Once they arrived in Shanghai, as long as the warehouse was ready, the coal could be shipped. He optimistically said, "After the Beiping-Shanghai line opens, the mine will be better." Ying Jinsun, the owner of Beiping Daming Electrical Appliance Store, went to Shanghai to buy machines, preparing to manufacture bakelite lamp holder parts when he returned. He said: In the past few years, the store had some models for making electric fans. When the Commander's Office of the Eleventh War Zone of the Kuomintang found out, they said they would borrow them for use. As a result, Ying Jinsun was left with a pile of IOUs, and the items disappeared. There were some passengers from the Northeast on the train. One said, "This connects Manchuria and Shanghai all at once," and another said, "You can take a train from Shanghai, pass through Siberia, and go all the way to Moscow." A person next to him then added, "You can go to Warsaw, you can go to Prague, Budapest..."
　　The next afternoon, the train passed the Yellow River Railway Bridge. A hundred and forty li to Jinan, green pines and cypresses lined both sides, and Mount Tai stood majestically.
　　The train passed Xuzhou, and it was past midnight. The croaking of frogs in the fields broke through the rumbling noise of the rolling wheels, indicating that the rice fields were becoming more and more numerous as the train traveled south.
　　Among the passengers were our cadres and soldiers who, in the years of past wars, left their relatives and dedicated themselves to the people's liberation cause. Today, the opening of the Beiping-Shanghai line brings them the opportunity to reunite. Xu A'gen, in the military carriage, is only twenty-one years old this year. He is from Wuxi and joined the New Fourth Army guerrillas as an orderly at the age of fourteen. He has been injured three times, and later fought in Jiaodong and central Shandong. He said with a smile, "I was too young when I left home, maybe my mother won't recognize me now." A female comrade named Zhang Yuanqing, from Jiangyin, joined the Children's Troupe at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War and went to Wuhan, Guilin, and Guizhou. She arrived in Yan'an in 1939 and has not been home for thirteen years. She imagines what her mother has become. The train passed the brand-new Huai River Railway Bridge, which is more than 500 meters long, safe and stable. People saw the power of the people with their own eyes, which increased their confidence in the construction of the new China.
　　As the train traveled south, lakes and swamps were connected, the rice seedlings were verdant, and water buffaloes were bathing in the river, a scene of peaceful construction. When the train crossed the Yangtze River, it drove directly onto the ferry. The wide river surface only took more than ten minutes to cross. The people of Jiangnan said excitedly, "It's from Beiping, it's from Beiping!" (This newspaper's special dispatch from Shanghai on the 13th)

　　北平到上海的列车上
    本报记者陆灏
    七月十日从北平首次开向上海的列车，载着五百五十五位旅客。每一个人有他自己不同的喜欢的心情。
    那位鬓发如霜的老太太，到上海欢晤已经离别八年的闺女和女婿；这位穿蓝士林布的中年妇女，去上海看她久别的母亲。平沪通车使相隔一千四百九十六公里的北平和上海缩短了距离，离别者得以团聚，南北物资的交流，也不会再为长江、黄河的天险所隔绝了。
    列车由北平到天津，窗外下着连绵的雨，但旅客们谈兴正浓，门头沟胜利煤矿（私营）董事马千里去上海办理该矿煤炭南运的问题，铁路局已经答应帮助他们解决运输上的困难，到了上海，只要把栈房准备好，煤炭就可启运。他乐观的说：“平沪通车以后，矿上就好了”。北平达明电料行老板应锦荪到上海买机器，准备回来制造胶木灯口零件。他说：在前几年，店里有一部分制造电扇的模型，国民党十一战区长官司令部知道了，说是借去用用，结果，给应锦荪留下了一堆借条，东西是不见了。车上有一些来自东北的旅客，一个说，这一下子把满洲里和上海联在一起了，另一个说：从上海坐车，经过西伯利亚，一直可到莫斯科；旁边一个则接着说，可以到华沙，可以到布拉格，布达佩斯，……
    翌日下午车经黄河铁桥，到济南一百四十余华里，两边青松翠柏，泰山巍峨伫立。
    车过徐州，夜已过半，田里阁阁蛙声划破滚动着的车轮的巨响，这说明车越往南行稻田越来越多了。
    旅客中有我们的干部和战士，在以往战争的年月，他们离开亲人，献身人民解放事业。今天平沪通车，带给他们团聚的机会。在军人车厢里的徐阿根，今年才二十一岁，无锡人，十四岁参加新四军的游击队当勤务，受过三次伤，后来转战胶东鲁中，他笑着说：“我离家的时候太小，现在母亲也许不认识了。”一位女同志名叫张沅青，江阴人，抗日战争开始时参加孩子剧团，到了武汉、桂林、贵州，一九三九年到了延安，已经十三年不回家了，她想象母亲不知已经变成什么样子了。车过长达五百余米的崭新的淮河铁桥，平安稳固，人们亲眼看到了人民的力量，对于新中国的建设，增加了无限信心。
    车往南行，湖沼相连，稻秧碧绿，水牛在河里洗澡，一片和平建设的气象。车过长江时，一直开到轮渡上，宽宽的江面，只走了十多分钟。江南的人们兴奋的说：“是北平开来的，是北平开来的！”　　　（本报十三日自上海专电）
