　　Special Handicraft Loans Come to an End!
　　Bank of China in Beiping
　　Inspects Loan Usage
　　Mostly Used for Purchasing Raw Materials and Paying Wages
　　[This newspaper reports] After the Bank of China in Beiping completed the issuance of special handicraft loans, it began preliminary inspections. To promote export trade and support the recovery of special handicraft production, the bank began handling loan business for this sector on June 27th. This ended on July 19th, following the People's Bank of Beiping Branch's measures to tighten lending. During this period, a total of 24.54 million RMB was lent out, benefiting 15 special handicraft industries, including velvet and silk paper flowers, enamelware, carpets, copper and tinware, drawnwork embroidery, lacquer carving, embroidery, jade articles, inlay work, porcelain firing, ivory carving, silver filigree, jade bonsai, glasswork, and silk flowers, totaling 274 workshops. To understand the production situation of special handicraft industries after receiving loans, the bank began inspection work after the completion of these loans, initially sampling 18 workshops. Although the first batch only inspected 11 industries and 18 workshops, a general overview of the situation after the industry received loans can be seen. From this sample survey, it was learned that the loan usage was divided into three aspects: purchasing raw materials, purchasing food, and paying wages. Among them, purchasing raw materials accounted for the largest proportion, accounting for 69% of the total loans, followed by paying wages, accounting for 18%, and purchasing food, accounting for 13%. The most obvious effect of the loans was reflected in smaller workshops. Many small workshops, before receiving loans, suffered from production stagnation or semi-stagnation due to lack of funds. After receiving loans, they immediately recovered. For example, the Yan Qingrong lacquer carving workshop had many semi-finished products that could not continue to be manufactured. After receiving funds, it was able to purchase food and pay wages, and production was immediately restored, turning semi-finished products that were almost considered waste products into finished lacquer carvings. As for larger workshops, these loans only served to increase a portion of their working capital. This inspection work is currently continuing, with the aim of comprehensively understanding the production recovery situation of the industry after receiving loans.

　　特种手工业贷款告一段落！
  　平中国银行
  　检查贷款用途
    多为购买原料开付工资
    【本报讯】平中国银行所办理之特种手工业贷款，于发放告一段落后，开始初步检查。该行为促进出口贸易，扶助特种手工业恢复生产，于六月廿七日开始办理对该业的贷款业务。至本月十九日随人民银行北平分行紧缩放款措施而告一段落，在此阶段内共贷出人民币二千四百五十四万元，受益的特种手工业有：绒绢纸花、珐琅、地毯、铜锡器、挑补花、雕漆、刺绣、玉器、镶嵌、烧瓷、象牙雕刻、银蓝、玉树盆景、料器、花丝等十五业，共计作坊二百七十四户。该行为了解贷款后特种手工业生产情况，特于是项贷款告一段落后开始检查工作，首批抽查作坊十八户。首批虽仅检查十一业、十八户作坊，但对该业获得贷款后之一般情况可以看出梗概。由此次抽查中，得悉该业贷款用途，分添购原料、购买食粮和开付工资三方面，其中以添购原料者居多，占总放款额百分之六十九，其次为开付工资占百分之十八，再次为购买食粮占百分之十三。贷款后的效果，最明显的表现在较小的作坊上，许多小作坊在未获得贷款前，因缺乏资金，生产陷于停顿或半停顿，得到贷款后立即恢复起来，如雕漆业的阎庆荣作坊，原有许多半成品不能继续制造，在贷到资金后，得以购买食粮，开付工资，生产随即恢复，把几乎置放成为废品的半成品继续制成雕漆成品。至于此项贷款对较大的作坊，仅起了增加一部流动资金的作用。此项检查工作现正继续进行，以期全面的了解该业获得贷款后之生产恢复状况。
