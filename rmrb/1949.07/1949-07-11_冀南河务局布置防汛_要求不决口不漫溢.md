(Jinnan Electric Dispatch) The Jinnan Administrative Office River Authority convened a joint meeting of secretaries from each administrative office, heads of county construction sections, and directors of river authority offices in late June. The meeting, lasting seven days, reviewed spring work and deployed flood control measures. Most counties along the river have completed their spring work plans. If strict vigilance is maintained during this year's flood season, water disasters can generally be avoided. Based on different situations, the meeting formulated specific principles and tasks for summer flood control: the breached sections of the Grand Canal in the Linqing and Dezhou areas must be completely blocked, ensuring no breaches or overflowing. The above-ground sections of the Fuyang River's main stream in Wuyi and Chengci must be guaranteed against breaches or overflowing. Efforts should be made to minimize overflowing in the underground sections. To accomplish the above tasks: 1. A concentrated effort should be made to complete unfinished spring work. A thorough inspection of the dikes and breached areas should be conducted, increasing their height and thickness. Brick dams should be built along dangerous sections of the river, and shallow areas should be dredged to reduce the risk of overflowing. 2. The Wei River, Zhang River, Fuyang River, and other important tributaries should be divided into sections for strict defense. Each district and village should organize able-bodied young people to keep watch in shifts, regardless of day or night, rain or shine, using a unified signal system. 3. Strengthen communication between upstream and downstream areas and water situation reporting, based on the main streams. The flood season is from July 1st to Bailu (approximately September 7th). Local flood control headquarters should be organized, telephones installed, and administrative leaders such as commissioners and county heads should serve concurrently as directors, grasping the water situation upstream and downstream. Capable cadres should be stationed in the Taihang Administrative Office to promptly report mountain water conditions to the Jinnan District General Headquarters.
