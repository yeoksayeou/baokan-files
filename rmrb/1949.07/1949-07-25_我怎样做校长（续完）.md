　　How I Do Principal (Continued)
    (By Guo Luowadeyi)
    The Student Committee has various departments – learning, cultural entertainment, sports, sanatorium and economics, and an editorial department – and it completes tremendous work in uniting and organizing the student collective. The "Student Code of Conduct" is the de facto charter of the Student Committee, and the goal of the committee's activities is to implement these codes. The working ability of the Student Committee is determined in many ways by the work of its various departments and the teachers attached to them, and by the composition of organizers at all levels and the organization of duty officers at all levels.
    The work plans of the Student Committee and its various departments are announced publicly. These plans should be specific and precise. For example, the Cultural Entertainment Department announces in its plan that a systematic lecture for students in grades five, six, and seven will be held at a certain time on a certain day at a certain place, stating the topic and the speaker. The Sports Department plans to carry out certain measures, and so on.
    The monthly plans of the Student Committee and its various departments are first approved by the principal.
    The student duty system for the whole school and each grade plays a significant organizational role. The duty students for the whole school are appointed by the Student Committee from the senior grades on a rotating basis. Duty officers for each grade are appointed by the grade head teacher and grade organizer.
    We believe that it is best to appoint three grade duty officers at once for a week. In this way, the grade will never be in a state of having no duty students. Duty officers freely switch shifts and share simple tasks: going out to get flowers to decorate the classroom, opening and closing vents, getting chalk for the blackboard, and so on.
    To make the duty officers seriously complete their tasks, it is necessary to raise and consolidate their prestige in the grade and the whole school. Here, the duty officer is a sacred and inviolable person, and all his instructions should be executed without bargaining. Those who disobey the duty officer will be punished by the teacher, the Student Committee, and even the principal.
    We spare no time and effort to support the prestige of the duty officers, because only under this condition can the necessary order in the school and the normal completion of the daily schedule be guaranteed.
    The student publications of the whole school, each grade, and the Young Pioneers are only manifested as the true soul of the student collective when they pay due attention to the "Student Code of Conduct" in addition to clarifying common problems.
    All our school newspapers have two columns: "Implementers of the Student Code of Conduct" and "Violators of the Student Code of Conduct." In these two columns, the good and bad sides of life in the whole school, each grade, detachment, or group are clarified. I am no longer talking about simple things like arranging the newspaper; the arrangement should be impeccable.
    Extracurricular and off-campus work is a direct continuation of the teaching process, and a natural deepening and completion of the teaching process. Student organizations have ample possibilities to demonstrate their organizational abilities in this regard. Our job, of course, is to help student organizations in this area and make them leaders of all extracurricular and off-campus work.
    Group organization and work, evening parties, exhibitions, matinees, public service labor, etc. – all of this is reflected in the plans of the student organizations. The newspaper publishes things about this. For this purpose, forces are being organized and deployed. Students with certain work tasks report to the Student Committee and at Young Pioneers meetings or at general student meetings.
    In this way, I can influence the student collective through the student organization. But it is unnecessary, and even harmful, to overburden the work of the Student Committee with small problems (such as analyzing misunderstandings between students, unimportant violations of rules, etc.). But, for example, the fact that students disobey the duty officer under any circumstances, I submit it to the student organization for discussion. This consolidates school discipline and educates students.

    (V) Work with Parents
    The close connection between the school and parents helps the principal and facilitates his work in uniting teachers and students.
    We hold parent conferences, at which we organize discussions on common educational issues of reality. At the parent meetings of each grade, we talk about the specific educational problems that arise in that grade. The systematic lectures held by parents are aimed at carrying out broad educational propaganda. But I cannot yet say that we have experienced complete satisfaction from all this work, because this work mostly has an episodic nature.
    It is not good that these parent meetings are not attended by many people. These meetings usually attract the most active part of the parents, who themselves study the basic educational issues not badly.
    For several years, we have already transferred the basic social activities to production, to workshops, to reading rooms, where we can carry out work on the working masses - not only on educational issues, but also on various cultural and political work.
    A genuine connection is established between the school and the parents, and between the school and the work of the enterprise, a connection that makes both sides indispensable to each other. In this regard, the mass work teacher can fully exert his strength. At the same time, we have also discovered a good foundation for utilizing student collectives (organizing reading rooms, showing students' amateur artistic activities, carrying out various public service works, etc.).
    We should not be afraid of the difficulties and individual organizational frictions on this road. We should insistently strive to include enterprise work and "school days" in the plan.
    These works will be implemented, will fight for the right to survive, and will become an indispensable need.

    　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×
    Experience has shown that to ensure the correct leadership of the school, we must first carefully, persistently, and skillfully work with teachers, help them, learn from them, and promote good experience in ordinary practice. We should not condone the shortcomings of individual teachers, but bravely and thoroughly criticize them, thereby promoting the growth of the teaching staff.
    Secondly, it is very important to correctly estimate the role of the student collective and its various organs in teaching work. We should bravely place the big problems of the school in front of the student collective, so that it is possible to solve these problems without annoying guardianship.
    Finally, do not forget Lenin's instructions at any time: to say that the school is outside of life and outside of politics is a lie and hypocrisy; and we should do our best to consolidate the prestige of the school in the hearts of the working people. (The End)

　　我怎样做校长（续完）
    （郭洛瓦德伊作）
    学生委员会设有各部门--学习的、文化娱乐的、体育的、疗养和经济的部门及编辑部-，在团结与组织学生集体上完成着极大的工作。“学生守则”是学生委员会事实上的章程，而该委员会活动的目标便是执行这些守则。学生委员会的工作能力在许多方面是由其各部门的工作及附属于各部门的教师的工作决定的，是由各级组织者的组成成份及各级值班者的组织决定的。
    学生委员会及其各部门的工作计划是布告周知的。这些计划应该具体而确切。例如文化娱乐部门在计划中通告称，供第五、六、七级学生听取的系统讲演将于某日某时某地举行，报告题目为什么，由谁来作。体育部门则预定进行某某措施等等。
    学生委员会及其各部门的每月计划，先由校长批准。
    全校的和各级的学生值班制度，都是起重大的组织作用的。全校的值班学生由学生委员会从高级班次学生中轮流任命。各级的值班者由级任导师及级组织者任命。
    我们确信最好一次即任命一周的三个级值班者。这样，级上便永远不会处于没有值班学生的状态。值班者自由地换班，分担不麻烦的任务：出去弄布置教室的花卉，开关通风口，出去弄黑板等等。
    要使值班者认真地完成自己的任务，便需要提高与巩固他们在级上及全校中的威信。在我们这里，值班者是神圣不可侵犯的人物，他的一切指示，都应当不讲价钱地予以执行。未服从值班者的人，教师、学生委员会、甚至校长是要处罚的。
    我们不惜花时间和力量以支持值班者的威信，因为只有在这一条件下，学校中必要的秩序与每日作息制度的正常完成才有保障。
    全校的、各级的、儿童团的学生出版物，只有在它除了阐明共同问题以外还对“学生守则”给予应有的注意时，才显现为学生集体的真心灵。
    我们一切的学校报纸都有这样两栏：“执行学生守则者”，“破坏学生守则者”。在这两栏中，全校、各级、支队或小组的生活中的好坏两面便阐明了。我已经不谈报级排编之类的简单东西了，编排应该是无可非议的。
    级外工作与校外工作，乃是教学过程的直接继续，是教学过程的自然的深刻化与完成。学生组织在这方面有充份的可能性表现自己的组织能力。我们的事情当然是在这方面帮助学生组织，使学生组织成为一切级外工作与校外工作的领导者。
    小组的组织与工作，晚会，展览会，日间戏，公益劳动等等--这一切在学生组织的计划中都是反映出来了的。报纸刊载关于这方面的东西。为这一点，是在组织着和布署着力量的。负有一定工作任务的学生，向学生委员会及在儿童团会议上或在全体学生会议上作报告。
    这样，我便有可能通过学生的组织影响学生集体了。但以小问题而使学生委员会的工作过重，乃是不必要的，甚至是有害的（如学生之间的误会的分析，不关紧要地破坏规则等等）。但例如在任何情况下学生不服从值班者的事实，我是提交学生组织讨论的。这巩固着学校纪律，教育着学生。
    （五）对家长的工作
    学校与家长的密切联系，帮助着校长，便利着他在团结教师与学生方面的工作。
    我们举行家长大会，在这些大会上组织关于现实的普通教育问题的讨论。在各级的家长会议上，我们谈及该级所产生的具体的教育问题。如家长举行的系统的讲演，是以作广泛的教育宣传为目标的。但我还不能说：我们从这一切工作中体验了完全的满意，因为这一工作大部份带有插曲性质。
    这一切的家长会议没有很多人出席，便不好了。这些会议通常网罗最积极的一部份家长，这些家长对于基本教育问题自己是研究得不坏的。
    我们几年来便已将基本的社会活动转入生产，转入车间，转入阅报处了，在这里，能对劳动群众进行工作--不仅关于教育问题的，而且也关于各种文化工作、政治工作的。
    学校与家长之间，以及学校与企业工作之间，建立着真切的联系，这一联系使双方成为互相不可或缺的了。在这方面，群众工作教师可以充分发挥自己的力量。同时，我们也发现了利用学生集体的良好基础（整理阅报处，展示学生业余艺术活动，进行种种公益工作等等）。
    不应该害怕这一道路上的困难及个别的组织龃龉。应该坚持地力求将企业工作与“学校日”列入计划中。
    这些工作将实行得起来，将为生存权而战斗，进而成为不可或缺的需要。
    　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×
    经验表明了：要保证对学校的正确领导，首先要仔细地、坚持地、熟练地对教师进行工作，帮助他，向他学习，发扬好的经验于普通的实践中。应该不姑息个别教师的缺点，勇敢而彻底地予以批评，从而促进教员干部的成长。
    其次非常重要的一点是，正确地估计学生集体及其各机关在教学工作上的作用。应该勇敢地将学校的大问题放在学生集体面前，使其有可能不要讨厌的监护而解决这些问题。
    最后，随时不要忘记列宁的指示：说学校是在生活之外，在政治之外，乃是撒谎与虚伪；并应该尽力巩固学校在劳动者心目中的威信。（完）
