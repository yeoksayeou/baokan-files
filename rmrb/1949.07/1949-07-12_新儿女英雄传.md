    Episode 20 Victory (continued)
    Four

    The charge bugle outside the South Gate blew with all its might. The surrounding gunfire, mixed with the explosions of grenades, was intense.

    The morale of the puppet troops wavered, and they had long since lost the will to fight. The puppet troops at the South Gate were the first to open the city and surrender, and the puppet troops at the East Gate also laid down their weapons. Most of the Japanese devils in the city were surrounded in the school on South Street. Several comrades from the Japanese Anti-War League branch who came from the sub-district, who happened to be Mi Tian and "Chu Yi Jia San Lang" and their gang, followed our troops to assist in the work. At this moment, they used Japanese to shout and persuade the Japanese soldiers to surrender. They also sang a Japanese song, which made the Japanese soldiers in the school cry; in less than a quarter of an hour, they hung up a white flag.

    When the city was breached, He Shixiong and the Japanese commander led a group of enemy puppet troops and hurriedly ran west, trying to break out from the West Gate. But the West Gate was on fire, burning half the sky red. They immediately rushed to the North Gate. The sentry box outside the North Gate had already surrendered its guns. He Shixiong ordered two machine gunners to open the North Gate, machine-gunning heavily at the front. A group of people desperately rushed out.

    The militiamen retreated a little when they saw the machine guns firing fiercely, and grenades rained down. Many enemy puppet troops were killed; the first machine gunner was also blown half his head off. The enemies ran in panic. In the midst of the chaos, He Shixiong, regardless of his concubine, pointed a pistol at the second machine gunner and shouted, "Shoot! I'll kill you if you don't shoot!" He and the Japanese commander, Zhang Jinlong, and several others followed the machine gun, desperately rushing out to the west from the side.

    Some of the militiamen ran into the city, and some captured the scattered enemies. Niu Dashui and Gao Tun'er led people, following closely behind He Shixiong and their gang. He Shixiong's group ran to the embankment. Another group of militiamen was guarding the front, suddenly shouting, "Password!" They couldn't answer, and immediately a volley of gunfire came over, several people fell, and the machine gunner also rolled to the side. The Japanese commander injured his right arm and dropped his gun. Zhang Jinlong was shot in the leg; he gritted his teeth and fled with Guiban and He Shixiong into the wilderness.

    The moon in the sky was shining brightly, and Dashui and Gao Tun'er could see them clearly, chasing closely. Zhang Jinlong was unable to shoot effectively with his left hand, and he couldn't run fast. He fell behind. Several people fired at him together, and Zhang Jinlong was shot several times and immediately fell.

    He Shixiong and Guiban ran into a large soybean field, wanting to hide but unable to, they hurriedly ran towards the sorghum field in front. He Shixiong's hat had long been lost, and only one shoe remained. The more he wanted to run fast, the less he could move. Guiban's Japanese sword kept tripping him, and he couldn't bother to take it off.

    Seeing that the pursuers were only a few yards away, bullets flew over their heads. The two of them could no longer run, and simply lay down in the soybean field. Dashui and the others scattered around, searching with their waists bent.

    He Shixiong saw Niu Dashui approaching and aimed and fired a shot. The bullet grazed Dashui's side and hit Gao Tun'er in the stomach; Gao Tun'er fell. Dashui was shocked and rushed to help him. Gao Tun'er's intestines were flowing out, but he still opened his round eyes, angrily shouting, "Why are you worrying about me? Quickly eliminate the enemy!"

    At that moment, another bullet whizzed past. Dashui spotted the target and immediately fired a shot, and the gun in He Shixiong's hand was shot away. Dashui saw that he had no gun, and rushed up to capture him alive. Unexpectedly, Guiban hid in the bean field and drew his Japanese sword with his left hand, swinging it violently and slashing at Dashui's leg; Dashui fell, and his gun also fell in the bean field. Guiban then slashed at his head; Dashui endured the pain, jumped up, and pinned Guiban down, snatching the sword from his hand and hacking wildly, saying through gritted teeth, "See how powerful you are! See how powerful you are!" Liu Xi'er and Wei Dameng rushed up and killed He Shixiong; seeing that Niu Dashui's face was covered in blood, they quickly helped him up.

    The militiamen and civilians also rushed up, those with guns, those with knives, those with iron hoes and iron spades, shouting and cursing, and in a short while, these two big-headed Japanese traitors were chopped and smashed into minced meat...

    In the moonlight, Niu Dashui became a blood-soaked man and passed out.

    Five

    When Niu Dashui woke up, people had already carried him into the city. Many comrades and ordinary people quietly surrounded him, and a doctor and a medic were washing his wounds. The light shone on a slanted wound on his forehead, which was three inches long, revealing the white bone. The doctor carefully applied the medicine and had just wrapped it with gauze when Xiu Nü'er, supporting Yang Xiaomei, and Li Xiaozhu, holding Xiao Pang, came in.

    In the first half of the night, the puppet troops took Yang Xiaomei behind the City God Temple, pretending to fire three shots, and then defected with her. (Li Lannü and Squad Leader Zhao were also rescued.) At this moment, Xiaomei's face was pale, her left hand hooked around Xiu Nü'er's neck, and her right hand leaned on a stick. Her two legs were struggling as she walked over with great difficulty; the comrades quickly stepped aside.

    As soon as Xiaomei saw Dashui, her heart was filled with joy, and she couldn't hold back her tears. The tears fell down, and she couldn't help but cry. Xiaomei's voice changed as she said, "Dashui! I never thought... I would see you again in this lifetime!" Other comrades also shed tears. Xiaomei said in a changed voice, "Old Cai was right, our victory was bought with blood! Just now I saw Tun'er... Alas, how many people have we sacrificed!" Tears sparkled in Dashui's eyes, and he said excitedly, "Tun'er died gloriously! He told us to eliminate the enemy before he died. We must remember his words! Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the reactionaries have not yet been overthrown; if we are alive, let's do it again!" Xiaomei said excitedly, "As long as we have this breath, we will fight the reactionaries to the end! We have endured all kinds of hardships in these years of the War of Resistance, what are we afraid of!" Xiu Nü'er said, "Chairman Mao led us to defeat the Japanese devils, and we will surely win if we follow him!"

    Dashui thought it was very happy, and his trembling hands took Xiao Pang, kissed his little face, and said, "That's right! It doesn't matter if we suffer a little, as long as the revolution is successful, these children will enjoy happiness in the future!" Just as he was talking, Hei Lao Cai, Liu Xi'er, and Wei Dameng came to see Dashui. Lao Cai joyfully raised a hand and said, "Reporting good news to you: we have won battles in various places; in Central Hebei alone, we have recovered Xiongxian, Baxian, Anguo, Boye, Lixian... a total of thirteen county towns!" Everyone in the room clapped and cheered.

    Suddenly, there was a crackling sound of firecrackers outside, like the New Year. For a while, gongs and drums were deafening, mixed with people's cheers, and the sound grew closer and closer. Xiu Nü'er jumped up happily and said, "The people are celebrating the victory, let's go and see!" Everyone smiled excitedly, and the young people hurried out...

    It was dawn, and a bright red flag was flying over the city wall. (The End)

    第二十回　胜利（续）
    四
    南门外的冲锋号一股劲的吹，四周围的枪声，夹着手榴弹的爆炸，打得热火朝天。
    伪军们军心动摇，早就不想打了。南门的伪军首先开城投降，东门的伪军也放下了武器。城里大部分鬼子都给包围在南大街学堂里。从分区来的日本反战同盟支部几位同志，刚好就是米田和“初一加三郎”那一伙，跟着咱们的队伍来配合工作。这会儿，他们就用日本语喊话，争取日本兵投降。他们还唱了一个日本歌，唱得学堂里的日本兵都哭下了；不到一刻钟，就挂起了白旗。
    城破的时候，何世雄和鬼子司令带着一部分敌伪军，急忙往西跑，想从西门突出去。可是西门着火了，烧得半边天通红。他们马上又往北门突。北门外的岗楼早缴了枪，城里何世雄叫两个机枪手，端着两挺轻机枪冲锋开道；他们猛的开开北门，机关枪在头里密密的扫射，一伙人拚命往外冲。
    民兵们看机枪打得挺猛，退了一下，手榴弹就象雨点似的打过来。好些敌伪军都炸死了；头一个机枪手也炸飞了半个脑袋。敌人惊慌的乱跑。一阵混乱中间，何世雄顾不得他的小婆，用手枪指着第二个机枪手，喝叫：“快打！不打我毙了你！”他和鬼子司令，张金龙几个跟着机枪，拚死命从侧面往西冲出去了。
    民兵们有的往城里奔，有的抓那些逃散的敌人。牛大水和高屯儿带了人，跟在何世雄他们的后面，紧紧追来。何世雄一伙跑到堤边，前面另有一部分民兵在把守，突然喊：“口令！”他们答不上，立时一阵排子枪打过来，几个人倒下了，机枪手也滚到了一边。鬼子司令右胳膊负了伤，枪也掉了。张金龙腿上中了一颗子弹；他咬着牙，跟龟板、何世雄慌忙往野地里跑。
    天边的月亮照着，大水高屯儿他们看得分明，紧追着不放。张金龙左手打枪不得劲，又跑不动了，落在后面。几个人朝着他＠＠＠一齐打过去，张金龙身上中了几颗子弹，立刻倒下了。
    何世雄和龟板跑进一大片豆子地里，想藏可藏不住，慌慌张张的朝前面高粱地里奔。何世雄的帽子早跑掉了，鞋也只剩了一只，越想跑得快，越跑不动。龟板挎的一把东洋刀，老是绊腿绊脚的，也顾不得解下来。
    眼看着追兵只隔几丈远了，枪子儿在他俩头上飞过。他两个再也跑不动，索性爬在豆子地里。大水他们四下里散开，弯着腰往这边搜索。
    何世雄一眼瞧见牛大水走近了，就瞄着打了一枪，子弹从大水的身边擦过去，打中了高屯儿的肚子；高屯儿跌倒了。大水吃了一惊，忙去扶他。高屯儿肠子都流出来了，还睁着圆彪彪的眼睛，发怒的喊：“你管我什么？快消灭敌人！”
    这当儿，又一颗子弹唰的飞过。大水发现了目标，连忙一枪打去，何世雄手里的枪就给打飞了。大水见他没了枪，忙奔上去捉活的。不提防那龟板藏在豆的里，左手早拔出了东洋刀，猛的一抡，砍在大水的腿上；大水跌倒了，枪也落在豆子地里。那龟板又照他头上砍了一刀；大水忍着痛，跳起来，一个扑虎儿压住那龟板，夺下他手里的刀乱砍，一面咬着牙说：“看你厉害！看你厉害！”柳喜儿魏大猛赶上来，打死了何世雄；瞧见牛大水脸上尽是血，急忙把他扶起来。
    民兵和民夫们也都冲上来了，拿枪的，拿刀的，拿铁镐铁铣的，喊着骂着，一阵子就把这两个鬼子汉奸的大头儿，连砍带砸，剁成了肉泥……
    月光里，牛大水成了血人儿，昏迷过去了。
    五
    牛大水醒来的时候，人们已经把他抬进城。屋里许多同志和老百姓，悄没声儿的围着他，一个医生和一个卫生员正在给他洗伤。灯光照着他脑门上斜斜的一条伤口，足有三寸长，露出了白的骨头。医生小心的上了药，刚用纱布给他缠好，秀女儿扶着杨小梅，李小珠抱着小胖，进来了。
    前半夜伪军把杨小梅带到城隍庙后面，假装打了三枪，就带着她反正过来了。（李兰女和赵班长也给救了出来。）这会儿，小梅脸儿白沙沙的，左手勾着秀女儿的脖子，右手拄着一根棍儿，压过杠子的两条腿，很艰难的走过来；同志们忙闪在两边。
    小梅一见大水，心坎里猛的一阵欢喜，她那眼泪可就撑不住了，泪珠儿扑扑扑的往下掉，忍不住哭出声来。旁的同志都跟着掉泪。小梅声音变了的说：“大水啊！想不到……这一辈子还能见你的面！”
    大水硬撑着坐起来；他半个脸儿包在白纱布里，睁大了一只眼，望着小梅，一时喉咙里象堵住了个什么，哽得说不出话来。可是他心眼儿里挺痛快，胜利的笑显在脸上。他拉住小梅的手儿说：“哈，小梅！咱们总算熬过来了，这下子咱们胜利啦！”
    小梅擦了擦眼泪，说：“老蔡说的对，咱们的胜利是用血换来的哟！刚才我瞧见屯儿了……唉，咱们牺牲了多少人啊！”大水眼里闪着泪花儿，激动的说：“屯儿死得真光荣！他临死的时候，还叫我们快消灭敌人。咱们得好好儿记住他的话！现在抗战胜利了，反动派可还没打倒；活着，咱们再干吧！”小梅兴奋的说：“只要有这口气，就跟反动派干到底！抗战这么些年，咱们什么苦都受过了，还怕什么！”秀女儿说：“毛主席领导咱们把鬼子都打败了，咱们跟着他，干什么不会胜利呀！”
    大水想着很高兴，颤抖的手儿接过小胖，亲亲他的小脸儿说：“可不是！咱们吃点苦不要紧，只要革命成了功，这些孩子们，将来可享福啦！”正说着，黑老蔡柳喜儿魏大猛来看大水。老蔡喜冲冲的扬着一只手儿说：“报告你们好消息：咱们各地方都打了胜仗；光是冀中，就收复了雄县、霸县、安国、博野、蠡县……一共十三座县城！”满屋子的人都拍手叫好。
    忽然，外面噼噼啪啪响起了鞭炮，象过年似的。一时锣鼓喧天，夹着人们的欢呼，声音越来越近。秀女儿快活的跳起来说：“老百姓庆祝胜利呢，咱们快去看！”人人脸上都兴奋的笑着，年轻人连忙奔出去……
    天明了，城头上飘扬着鲜亮的红旗。　　　　　　（全文完）
