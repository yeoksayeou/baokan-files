Why is the Beijing-Shanghai Through Train Delayed?
Deputy Director Zhen Tao of the Ministry of Railways Transportation Bureau Answers Our Reporter's Questions
Insufficient Understanding of Conditions Along the Route; Timetable Not Realistic

[This newspaper reports] The Beijing-Shanghai direct train service has played a significant role in connecting passenger transport between the north and south since it began operating on July 10th. Due to objective limitations and insufficient subjective effort, some shortcomings still exist in passenger train operation, and the general public is very concerned and attentive to this. The reporter, therefore, interviewed Zhen Tao, Deputy Director of the Transportation Bureau of the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways, who detailed various issues related to the Beijing-Shanghai through train.

He first emphasized that the frequent delays of the Beijing-Shanghai through train in the past half-month require examination and urgent improvement. In explaining the reasons for the delays, he pointed out that before formulating the Beijing-Shanghai train schedule, the Ministry of Railways did not have a detailed understanding of the conditions along the route, especially south of Bengbu. The schedule was based only on written reports from people sent by the Ministry of Railways to investigate the Shanghai Railway Bureau and Pukou, and therefore the schedule was not suitable for actual conditions. The issue of air defense was also not thoroughly considered, which meant that the train connection with the Pukou ferry was hampered by air defense. Therefore, when enemy planes raided, the train sheltered in Pukou awaiting transit, delaying the time, sometimes for as long as twelve hours. This is the basic reason for the difficulty in maintaining the train's on-time operation.

Secondly, leading comrades and staff of the transportation departments of various railway bureaus did not pay enough attention to the Beijing-Shanghai direct train. They did not treat it as a priority train and instead regarded it as a regular train, failing to manage it properly. Specifically, station masters and operations personnel at various stations did not personally receive the train, especially south of Bengbu in the Jinan Railway Bureau. In addition, responsible comrades of the transportation departments of various railway bureaus were indifferent to the delays and did not actively seek improvements, nor did they offer suggestions for improvement to the Ministry of Railways. At the same time, the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways did not supervise and urge the various railway bureaus enough, which also needs to be examined.

Furthermore, because it is the rainy season, water damage along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line has affected train delays, which is indeed one of the objective reasons. Delays are most frequent between Tianjin and Jinan and between Bengbu and Pukou. There were originally only a few slow zones in the newly repaired lines between Tianjin and Jinan, but due to water damage, the number of slow zones has increased to more than twenty, thus reducing speed, and line capacity has decreased from ×× pairs to × pairs. Between Bengbu and Pukou, the original speed was 25 to 35 kilometers per hour, but due to water damage, it has been reduced to 20 to 5 kilometers per hour, and the line capacity has also been reduced from ×× pairs to an average of × pairs. This has increased the incidents of delays on the Beijing-Shanghai train.

　　Continuous Rain and Water Damage Affect Delays
　　Staff Do Not Pay Enough Attention to the Beijing-Shanghai Train

Moreover, because the Beijing-Shanghai line has not been open for twelve years, the train crew is not very familiar with the line, which also affects speed. Attention is also not paid to the locomotives. Sometimes, freight-type and small locomotives are used to pull the train, showing that there is not enough attention being paid to the Beijing-Shanghai through train. There are also oversights at the water supply stations; the regulations stipulate that it should take eight to ten minutes to complete, but sometimes it is as late as twenty minutes. Even on July 12th and 13th, the military representative of the Shanghai Railway Bureau's Transportation Department and the Director of the Transportation Department stopped the operation of the upward train 12, the Beijing-Shanghai direct train, twice, without the approval of the Ministry of Railways, citing the lack of flexibility in passenger car turnaround, fully demonstrating a phenomenon of anarchy and indiscipline. In response to this matter, the Ministry of Railways has not only telegraphed to investigate the facts and discuss punishment, but has also ordered that there be no similar phenomenon in the future, urging all railway bureaus to pay attention.

　　Rescheduling the Timetable to Increase Speed; All Railway Bureaus Resolve to Guarantee On-Time Operation

In order to immediately improve the running time of the Beijing-Shanghai through train, the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways will first increase the train speed and strengthen ferry services according to the current opinions of the engineering departments and has already re-established the Beijing-Shanghai train schedule. After the rainy season stops and the lines are reinforced and repaired, it can be guaranteed to arrive on time in 44 hours. It has also been decided to implement onboard supervision in each section to strengthen the train crew's control of the train, and the heads of the train operation departments of each railway bureau will personally and directly manage and promptly direct operations. At the same time, each railway bureau will regularly organize inspections of the Beijing-Shanghai through train situation to ensure on-time operation. All railway bureaus must review and correct past shortcomings and work together for the people's railway cause.

Finally, Deputy Director Zhen said: At the press conference held by the Ministry of Railways on the 25th, reporters from the People's Daily reflected opinions in this regard. Some time ago, Professor Wu Daren of Nankai University in Tianjin and others made suggestions regarding freight rates and train schedules, which were very valuable, and we must humbly accept, study, and improve them. Furthermore, we earnestly hope that all sectors of society will offer more opinions on the Beijing-Shanghai through train and related transportation work so that we can improve them immediately and run the people's railway well.

　　平沪通车为何误点？
  　铁道部运输局甄陶副局长答本报记者问
    了解沿途情况不够时刻表不切合实际
    【本报讯】平沪直达列车于七月十日通车以来，对于贯串南北客运，起了很大的作用。由于客观条件的限制和主观努力的不够，在客车运行方面，尚存在着某些缺点，一般旅客对此都寄以很大关怀和注意。记者为此特走访军委铁道部运输局甄陶副局长，他对于有关平沪通车之各项问题，详述如下：
    他首先强调的说，平沪通车半月以来，经常误点，这种现象是需要检讨和急待改进的。在解释晚点原因时，他指出铁道部在制订平沪行车时刻表之前，对于沿途情况特别是蚌埠以南的情况，了解得不够详细，仅根据铁道部派人赴上海局及浦口等地调查归来的书面报告，订出与实际不适合的行车时刻表。对于防空问题，亦未曾周密考虑，致使列车衔接浦口轮渡的时间有碍防空，故当敌机袭扰，列车在浦口掩蔽待渡，延误时间，有的竟停留十二小时之久，这是造成列车运行不易正点的基本原因。
    其次各局运输工作领导同志以及工作人员对于平沪直达列车不够重视，没有把它当作上级列车优先运行，而视为一般列车，未能善于掌握。具体表现在各车站站长及运转人员不亲自接车，尤以济南局蚌埠以南为最。此外，各局运输工作负责同志对于晚点，漠不关心，不主动设法改进，亦未向铁道部提出改进意见；同时铁道部运输局督促与促使各局注意不够，这都要检讨的。
    又因时届雨季，津浦沿线，因水害而影响列车误点，实为客观原因之一。天津济南间和蚌埠浦口间，误点最多。津济间多为新修线路，原来慢行仅有一处，现因水害，增加慢行处所竟达二十余处，速度因而减低，线路容量亦由××对减至×对。蚌埠浦口间原来速度为二十五公里至三十五公里，现因水害减低至二十公里至五公里，线路容量亦由××对减低至平均为×对。这样，便加多了平沪列车误点的事故。
　　霪雨水害影响误点
　　员工对平沪车重视不够
    再因平沪已有十二年未通车，乘务员对线路不太熟悉，故亦影响速度。在机车方面亦不注意，有时用货物型式及小型机车牵引列车，可见对于平沪通车没有足够注意。各给水站亦有疏忽情况，规定八分十分上完，有时竟晚至二十分钟之久。甚至在七月十二日及十三日两日，上海局运务处军代表及运务处长以客车车底周转不灵为理由，未经铁道部批准，竟停运上行十二次平沪直达列车二次，影响南北客运运输，充分表现了无政府无纪律的现象。对于此事，铁道部除已电令调查实情议处外，并责成今后不得再有类此现象，促使各局注意。
　　重定时刻表提高速度　各局决保证正点运行
    为了立即改进平沪通车行车时间，铁道部运输局首先根据现在工务局的意见，提高行车速度，加强轮渡，并已重新更定平沪通车行车时刻表。雨季停止后，线路补强修整，即可保证四十四小时正点到达。并决定各区间实行添乘，加强乘务员对列车的掌握，在调度上，由各局车务处长亲自直接掌握并及时指挥运行。同时各局对平沪通车状况随时整理检查，保证正点运行。各局对于以往缺点，必须检讨纠正，共同为人民铁路事业而努力。
    最后，甄副局长说：二十五日铁道部召开的记者例会上，人民日报记者曾反映了这方面的意见；前些日子，天津南开大学校教授吴大任等曾提出运价及行车时刻表的意见，都非常宝贵，我们一定虚心接受研究改进。并且我们还要热烈希望各界对于平沪通车及有关运输工作多提意见，以便立时改进，把人民铁路办好。
