　　North China Political and Legal Work
　　Report by Xie Juezai, Minister of Justice of the North China People's Government
    [Ping City News] At the enlarged meeting of the Third Committee of the North China People's Government, Minister of Justice Xie Juezai delivered a report on political and legal work:

    Minister Xie's report on political and legal work comprehensively covered seven issues: democratic construction in counties and villages, public security, justice and the legal system, supervision work, social assistance, and cadres. Regarding democratic construction in counties and villages, he first explained that our democracy is fundamentally different from bourgeois democracy. Bourgeois democracy only has democracy in form, while our democracy first and foremost means that the people have democracy in life and economics (such as farmers obtaining land, agricultural loans, and various cooperatives). Only with democracy in life and economics can political democracy have practical significance. Secondly, he said that democratic construction mainly involves doing a good job of basic politics. Building government must mobilize the masses and rely on the people themselves to build it. When discussing the experience of county and village construction, he said: 1. The people hope that their representative meetings can solve all the problems they want to solve; 2. Meetings should be held in a timely manner to solve problems and strictly implement resolutions; 3. Representatives must maintain close contact with voters, solicit opinions at any time, and convey resolutions.

    Regarding public security issues, he said: We should distinguish between special agent sabotage, assassinations, political bandits, and secret societies used by special agents. These are the main targets and must be suppressed. Hooligans, good-for-nothings, disbanded soldiers, and habitual thieves are secondary targets; giving them a way out and education can eliminate them. Our approach should be to strengthen the people's organizations. If the people's organizations are tight, special agents and bandits naturally cannot be active. On the other hand, there must be sanctions against special agents and bandits.

    Speaking of judicial work and the establishment of the legal system, he said: Over the past nine months, achievements have been made in restoring judicial institutions, establishing systems, instructing on legal principles, and disseminating new legal thought. Except for some counties in eastern Hebei and Suiyuan that do not yet have judicial organizations, most other regions have them. There are already 300 judicial organs from the North China People's Court to the counties, and the reporting and review system has been widely implemented. The Ministry of Justice and the North China People's Court are actively carrying out the work of abolishing old laws and creating new laws.

    Speaking about supervision work, he said: Since the establishment of the Supervisory Yuan last September, the current supervision work has turned to the right track, not only passively investigating problems, but also actively using the power of impeachment to solve problems. For example, the illegal acts of Gao Yuangui, Deputy Director of the Jinnan Administrative Office, who defied orders, the Xinji Hardware Store case involving using public funds to facilitate private merchants' speculation, the Yumin Flour Company case involving deductions and embezzlement, and the Shijingshan fire case were reported to the government for punishment and correction as soon as they were discovered. Based on a year of experience, we believe that the focus of supervision work should be on economic construction, especially public enterprises and public property. As for the working method, his pointed out experience is that inspectors should follow the mass line, proceed from the interests of the masses, make the inspection consistent with the requirements of the masses, listen to opinions from all parties, and wait until the masses rise up together to inspect, so that less effort can be spent and more can be gained.

    Speaking about social assistance, he said: 59.55 million catties of grain have been distributed, and the famine has been overcome without any problems. Regarding the beggar issue, he said: In the countryside, wherever we go, there are no beggars. In the cities, there are many beggars left over from the past by the Kuomintang. Recently, beggars have been taken in, educated, and reformed to participate in production, and this problem has now been resolved.

    In addition, Minister Xie also gave a brief exposition on cadre issues and foreign affairs work.

　　华北政法工作
  　华北人民政府司法部谢觉哉部长报告
    【平市讯】华北人民政府第三次委员会扩大会议上，司法部谢觉哉部长关于政法工作的报告：
    谢部长的政法工作报告，综合讲了县村民主建政、治安、司法与法制、监察工作、社会救助与干部等七个问题。关于县村民主建政，首先他说明我们的民主与资产阶级的民主是根本不相同的，资产阶级的民主只有形式上的民主，而我们的民主则首先是人民有生活上、经济上的民主（如农民得到土地、农贷、各种合作社等）。只有有了生活上、经济上的民主，政治上的民主才有实际意义。其次他说民主建政主要是要把基础政治搞好。建政要发动群众，依靠人民自己去建造。在讲到县村建政经验时，他说：一、人民希望他们的代表会能解决他们所要解决的一切问题；二、应及时召开会议，解决问题，并严格执行决议；三、代表必须与选民密切联系，随时征询意见，传达决议。
    对于治安问题，他说：应分清特务破坏、暗杀、政治土匪与被特务利用的会门，这是主要的，必须镇压；流氓、二流子、散兵、惯窃，这是次要的，给以生路与教育，即可消弭。我们的办法，一方面应加强人民的组织机构，人民的组织机构严密，特务匪徒自然就不能活动；另方面要对特务匪徒有制裁。
    讲到司法工作与建立法制，他说：九个月来在恢复司法机构，建立制度，指示法律原则，传播新法学思想是有成绩的。除冀东、绥远有些县份尚无司法组织外，其他地区大都有了，从华北人民法院到各县已有三百个司法机关，报告及覆核制度已普遍执行。司法部与华北人民法院对废除旧法律，创造新法律工作正在积极进行。
    讲到监察工作，他说：自去年九月监察院成立以来，现在的监察工作已转入正轨，不只消极地调查问题，而且积极地用弹劾权去解决问题。如对冀南行署副主任高元贵违抗命令，信记五金商行案之以公款便利私商投机，裕民面粉公司案之克扣舞弊以及石景山失火案件等违法事件，一经查出即呈报政府予以处分纠正。依据一年来的经验，我们认为监察工作对象，应着重在经济建设，尤其是公营企业与公有财产。至于工作方法，他指出的经验是，检查人员要走群众路线，以群众利益出发，使检查与群众要求一致，听取各方的意见，直到群众起来一同检查，才可费力少而所得多。
    讲到社会救助，他说：发了五千九百五十五万斤粮食，灾荒是已经渡过去了，没有发生什么问题。对于乞丐问题，他说：在农村，我们到了哪里，哪里就没有了乞丐。城市里，由于过去国民党制造的遗留给我们的很多，过去市面曾有一个时期有过不少乞丐，最近将乞丐收容起来，教育改造，使他们参加生产，现在这一问题是得到解决了。
    此外，谢部长还对干部问题，外事工作也作了简扼的阐述。
