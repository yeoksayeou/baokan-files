Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: According to a Washington dispatch on the 18th from the U.S. Information Service, an official U.S. government news agency, Assistant Secretary of State Allen issued a statement on that day slandering the People's Liberation Army Military Control Committees in Shanghai, Hankou, and other places that had halted the activities of the U.S. Information Service, calling them "marauders." This is a new and serious incident in which the U.S. government deliberately harbors hostility towards and attacks the Chinese people. The reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army closed the U.S. Information Service is very simple, clear, and justified: the U.S. Information Service is part of the U.S. government's diplomatic apparatus. Since China and the United States have not established diplomatic relations, the Chinese people certainly cannot allow its diplomatic apparatus to conduct activities in China. If the diplomatic apparatus of the United States and any other country that has not established diplomatic relations with China conducts activities in China, it is an illegal activity, and the Chinese People's Government has every right to ban it. The U.S. government has no reason to object, and in fact, even Allen himself has not been able to cite any reason to oppose it. However, since Allen, a responsible official of the U.S. government, has slandered the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Chinese People's Government as "marauders," people cannot help but clarify who exactly are the marauders. As is well known, the U.S. government is the most brutal marauder in the world. It colludes with the Chinese traitor Chiang Kai-shek to plunder the wealth of the Chinese people, China's economic and political rights, and China's territory, airspace, and territorial waters. Although U.S. military forces have recently been forced to withdraw from Qingdao, they are still plundering Taiwan and South China. U.S. imperialist elements, who are deliberately shielded by the U.S. government, have even plundered the Chinese people's dignity, such as the notorious Peiping rape case and the Hankou collective rape case. Recently, U.S. imperialism instigated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to blockade the ports of the Liberated Areas and sent envoys to the Chiang bandits and its other two lackeys, Quirino and Syngman Rhee, to organize the so-called "Pacific Alliance" to prevent the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War throughout the country. This liberation war is against the plundering of China by U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The American looters seem to think that after being slaughtered by American weapons, the Chinese people should smile at these looters, hold welcome parties, and allow these looters to enjoy illegal privileges in China. The American looters also seem to think that if they say the Chinese people are looters, the American and world's honest people will believe that the looters are really the Chinese people and not these slanderers themselves. The Chinese people have indeed "looted" one thing, and that is the illegal privileges of the looters in China. The Chinese people will never show mercy to looters. Any foreign government that truly breaks off contact with the Kuomintang reactionaries, no longer colludes with and aids the reactionaries, and adopts a genuine, not deceptive, friendly attitude towards the people's China, the Chinese people are willing to negotiate with it on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty to establish diplomatic relations. This is the firm and unwavering position of the Chinese people. Any threats and slanders can only be met with a resolute counterattack from the Chinese people.

    美帝污蔑中国人民必须予以坚决反击
    我有权取缔美新闻处非法活动，决不对劫掠者施仁政。
    【新华社北平二十二日电】据美国官方通讯社美国新闻处华盛顿十八日电，美国政府助理国务卿艾伦于该日发表声明，污蔑停止美国新闻处活动的上海、汉口等地的人民解放军军事管制委员会为“劫掠者”。这是美国政府蓄意仇视并攻击中国人民的新的严重事件。中国人民解放军封闭美国新闻处的理由是非常简单明白和正当的，就是美国新闻处是美国政府外交机构的一部分，目前中国与美国既然没有建立外交关系，中国人民当然不能允许它的外交机构在中国进行活动。美国以及一切与中国没有建立外交关系的国家的外交机构如果在中国进行活动，就是非法活动，中国人民政府完全有权利予以取缔。美国政府没有任何理由可以反对，事实上连艾伦自己也没有能举出任何一点理由来加以反对。但是美国政府负责官员艾伦既然污蔑中国共产党、中国人民解放军和中国人民政府是“劫掠者”，人们倒不能不弄清楚究竟谁是劫掠者。如众所周知，美国政府正是世界上最凶暴的劫掠者，它勾结着中国的卖国贼蒋介石，大肆劫掠中国人民的财富，中国的经济政治权利和中国的领土、领空、领海。美国军事力量最近虽然被迫退出了青岛，但仍劫掠着台湾和华南。为美国政府所着意庇护的美帝国主义分子甚至掠夺了中国人民的人格，例如臭名昭著的北平强奸事件和汉口集体强奸事件。最近，美帝国主义曾策动蒋介石匪帮封锁解放区海口，并遣使蒋匪与它的另二条走狗季里诺以及李承晚组织所谓“太平洋联盟”，以阻挡中国人民解放战争在全国的胜利，这个解放战争就是反对美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮劫掠中国的。美国劫掠者似乎以为：中国人民在饱受美国武器屠杀之余，还应当向这些劫掠者赔笑脸，开欢迎会，允许这些劫掠者在中国享受非法的特权。美国劫掠者似乎又以为：他们说了中国人民是劫掠者，美国和世界上的正直人民就会相信劫掠者真的是中国人民而不是这些污蔑者自己。中国人民确是“劫掠”了一样东西，这样东西就是劫掠者在中国的非法特权。中国人民决不对劫掠者施仁政。任何外国政府，只要它确实断绝和国民党反动派的联系，不再勾结和援助反动派，并向人民的中国采取真正的而不是欺骗的友好态度，那么，中国人民就愿意和它在平等、互利和互相尊重领土主权的原则基础之上谈判建立外交关系。这是中国人民坚定不移的立场。任何威胁和污蔑，只能受到中国人民的坚决的反击。
