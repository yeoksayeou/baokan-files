　　Mei Lanfang's Speech at the Literary and Art Congress
　　[Ping City News] Mei Lanfang's speech at the Literary and Art Congress yesterday (10th) is as follows:
　　I am very pleased to be able to attend this National Congress of Literary and Art Workers and meet with everyone in this hometown that I have been away from for more than ten years.
　　I have been working in the theater industry for more than forty years, and I am truly ashamed that I have not made any great contributions. I am particularly excited to hear the leaders and experts at the meeting attach such importance to the dramas we perform and put forward various reform opinions.
　　Speaking of improving drama, I have been doing my best to promote it in the past twenty years, but due to the environment, I can only do it step by step.
　　My first step was to reform the many bad habits left over from the old era on the stage, to achieve the goal of tidiness and cleanliness. In this regard, I have finally achieved some results, which everyone must have seen, and I will not go into details due to time constraints. But this is just sweeping away some of the dust that has accumulated over the years. As for the content and ideological aspects, although I have been revising them from time to time, looking back on it today, I feel that it is not enough.
　　In the ten years or so after I left Beiping, I only wrote two plays, one is "Resisting the Jin Troops" and the other is "Life and Death Hate." These two plays were focused on strengthening the audience's awareness of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Besides this, I had no opportunity to do other work.
　　After hearing the insightful opinions of the gentlemen at this meeting, I feel even more that the content of the dramas we perform needs further reform. However, this work is quite arduous. On the one hand, we must reform the content to meet the current task of serving the people. On the other hand, we must preserve the essence of the techniques so that they are not lost. Regarding these two points, I hope that the People's Government and the literary and art leading organs will provide guidance and assistance so that we can obtain the correct direction, so that the cultural heritage left over from thousands of years can be carried forward, and under the banner of New Democracy, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we can truly achieve the goal of serving the people. This is what Lanfang and the workers in this field hope to achieve.

### 梅兰芳在文代大会上的发言

　　梅兰芳在文代大会上的发言
    【平市讯】梅兰芳昨（十）日在文代大会上的发言，文如下：
    兰芳这次来参加这个全国文学艺术工作者代表大会，能够同大家在这离别了十几年的故乡见面，是非常愉快的。
    我在戏剧界已经工作了四十几年了，没有什么大的贡献，真是惭愧得很。此次在会上听到各位首长、专家对于我们所演的戏剧这样重视，并且提出了各种改革意见，本人尤其觉得兴奋。
    讲到改良戏剧，本人在这二十年当中时时刻刻都在尽我的微薄的力量推动，但限于环境，只能一步一步慢慢的做。
    我第一步先从改革舞台上旧时代遗留下来许多不好的习惯着手，达到整齐清洁的目的。在这方面，总算有了一点效果，大家想必都看见了，限于时间，我也不细讲了。但是这不过是扫除一部分多年积聚下来的灰尘而已。至于内容意识方面虽然也随时在那里修改，但是今天想起来，感觉到还不够。
    在十几年前，我离开了北平以后，只编了两出戏，一出是“抗金兵”一出是“生死恨”，这两出戏是集中力量，提高观众对抗战的警觉性，此外没有机会再做其他工作。
    这次在会中听到各位先生的高论，更感觉到我们所演的戏剧的内容有进一步改革的必需。不过这种工作相当艰巨，一方面要改革内容，配合当前为人民服务的任务，一方面又要保存技术的精华，不致失传。关于这两点希望人民政府和文艺领导机关指导协助使我们得到正确的路线，使这千百年来遗留下的文化遗产能够发扬光大，在新民主主义旗帜之下，在毛主席领导下，真正达到为人民服务的目的。这是兰芳跟本界工作者所希望实现的事。
