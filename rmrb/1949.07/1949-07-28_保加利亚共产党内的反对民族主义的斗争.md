The individual manifestations of certain nationalism within the Bulgarian Communist Party were noticed directly from September 9, 1944, when the Tsarist-Fascist dictatorship was overthrown and a people's democratic regime was established. These manifestations of nationalism: first, lay in the fact that the decisive role of the Soviet Union and the Soviet army in the development of events that fundamentally changed Bulgaria's social system after September 9 was often underestimated in publications and speeches by some comrades. Second, in some cases, there was no clear understanding of the decisive role of the Soviet Union and the heroic Soviet army in maintaining the national independence and territorial integrity of the Bulgarian people and in leading them out of the devastating war into which they had been thrown by the Tsarist-Fascist clique with minimal sacrifice.

The Bulgarian people's decades-long heroic and sacrificial struggle against the Tsarist-Fascist dictatorship, and the indomitable perseverance shown by the Bulgarian people in defending freedom and national independence against imperialist persecution, can only be fully evaluated and correctly explained in connection with the Soviet army's tremendous and devastating victory over the fascist bandits and the growth of the Soviet Union's invincible power and its international prestige.

Nationalist errors in the period after September have been noticed and overcome in time. Currently, the Party has drawn sharp attention to similar harmful distortions of history.

The nationalist tendencies represented by Traycho Kostov became an extremely serious danger because, first, they occurred after the Bulgarian Party had already corrected the errors caused by the assessment of events after September 9; and second, because they were not manifested in the assessment of a particular individual event, but in the assessment of a fundamental political line of the Bulgarian Party, namely, Bulgaria's relations with the Soviet Union and the CPSU.

The danger of the nationalist tendencies represented by Traycho Kostov was further enhanced by the fact that Kostov's own tolerance and connivance at blatant anti-Soviet unreasonable actions and anti-Soviet sentiments were combined with his extremely erroneous, violating Marxist-Leninist organizational principles, methods of leading the Party and managing the country's practical work.

The Party realized that this was no longer a particular individual error of Traycho Kostov – no matter how serious an individual error, as long as he sincerely admitted the error and tried to correct it, it could be corrected – the line represented by Kostov was a systematic political error based on the most obvious nationalist biases, and based on a anti-Bolshevik attitude towards the Party's leadership methods that endangered the Party and the country. Open discussion and public criticism of Traycho Kostov's actions had become absolutely necessary.

A series of indisputable facts confirm this:

When Bulgaria implemented the Law on State Secrets, which aimed to prevent spies from the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries from accessing information and intelligence of great significance to our country's independence, Traycho Kostov, in his capacity as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, personally ordered that this law be effectively applied to Soviet representatives. Kostov's action blatantly demonstrated distrust of the Soviet Union, a country with which Bulgaria had the closest political and economic relations – relations that demonstrated the socialist essence of the two countries' state systems and mutual relations.

Traycho Kostov made this decision on his own initiative without even reporting it to the Politburo or the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party in advance.

Although Soviet-Bulgarian trade relations were based on the fullest mutual trust, with no "secrets" or any sharp practices, Traycho Kostov systematically concealed from Soviet commercial representatives the prices of certain commodities that Bulgaria sold to capitalist countries. He only admitted this fact after a member of the Politburo confirmed the existence of a directive on concealing prices, issued by Kostov for many years. The existence of this directive confirms that Traycho Kostov's sinful behavior on the issue of relations with the Soviet Union had a long history and was deeply rooted.

A political judgment on these facts must be made in connection with the assessment of the current international situation as a whole.

We have witnessed the rabid imperialists launching an anti-Soviet movement. The purpose of this movement is to try to shake the confidence of all nations in the Soviet Union, to undermine the Soviet Union's international prestige, to isolate the Soviet Union spiritually, and to prepare for an imperialist war of aggression against the Soviet Union. At present, the relationship with the Soviet Union is precisely the dividing line between the imperialist and anti-imperialist camps. This relationship unerringly determines which camp a country, a government, or a socio-political group belongs to.

At the same time, the imperialists are also conducting a movement against the Soviet Union's friends – against all New Democratic countries. At present, the most insidious arrows are being fired at our republic, at countries that maintain faithful friendship with the Soviet Union. The imperialists are doing everything possible to intimidate us, while openly sheltering the Tito-Trotsky group and promising them various forms of assistance, trying to use this means to fool us, and to make us believe that only by opposing the Soviet Union can Bulgaria be saved from the hostility of the imperialists.

Based on the above facts, Comrade Dimitrov made a completely correct judgment on Traycho Kostov's actions at the meeting of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party on January 18 of this year. Comrade Dimitrov called this action an anti-Soviet action (which Kostov himself actually admitted). Kostov's actions became anti-Soviet because: the Law on State Secrets, which was seemingly aimed at fighting Bulgaria's enemies, could somehow involve the relationship between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union; this distrust, this shameful assumption that the Soviet Union would harm Bulgaria's national interests, was a blatant hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union.

Kostov claimed that the motivation for concealing the prices of certain commodities in negotiations with the Soviet Union was for Bulgaria's commercial interests. But who doesn't know that if our trade with the Soviet Union were based on the same trade principles that we currently establish with capitalist countries, then we would have encountered insurmountable difficulties long ago and embarked on the tragic road to economic collapse.

It is only because of the Soviet Union's strong and effective assistance that we have safely navigated the most critical years and are today improving our country's economic level, building the foundations of socialism with full confidence. The socialist characteristics of the relations between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria eliminate any form of state secrets from the Soviet Union.

There is no need to make a complete comparison between Traycho Kostov's path and the current policies of the Tito group, but it must be pointed out that Yugoslavia's departure from the Soviet alliance and joining the imperialist camp began precisely with the refusal to inform the Soviet Union about Yugoslavia's economic and other conditions (at that time, Yugoslavia's representatives – Djilas, Kardelj, and others – were in the Soviet Union and had every possibility of obtaining and had obtained all the information).

Traycho Kostov sharply criticized the behavior of undermining collective principles in the Party leadership (excessive criticism, exceeding the facts and needs). But he used his position to attempt to turn collective leadership into a trick to achieve personal desires. He arbitrarily decided on issues of great significance to the Party and the country. He implemented a "his own" set of methods of Bonapartism in the Party.

　　保加利亚共产党内的反对民族主义的斗争
    保加利亚共产党中央政治局委员  弗·科拉罗夫
    保加利亚共产党内的某些民族主义的个别表现，从一九四四年九月九日起从推翻了保皇——法西斯专政和建立人民民主政权之日起，即直接被引起注意了。这些民族主义的表现：第一，在于往往在出版物和某些同志的讲演里曾对苏联和苏联军队在九月九日以后从根本上改变了保加利亚的社会制度的诸事件的发展中的决定作用估计不足。第二，在于在某些情况下，对苏联与英雄的苏联军队在对保加利亚人民保持了自己的民族独立与领土完整，并以最少的牺牲走出了被保皇——法西斯集团投入的毁灭性的战争里的决定作用没有明确的认识。
    保加利亚人民的反对保皇——法西斯专政，坚持了数十年的英勇牺牲的斗争，保加利亚人民在反对帝国主义的迫害保卫自由与民族独立中表现出来的不可屈服的毅力，只有和苏联军队对法西斯匪军的巨大无比的摧毁性的胜利相联系，与苏联的不可战胜的威力及其国际威信的增长相联系，才能作出完全的估价与正确的说明。
    九月以后一个时期的民族主义的错误已经被及时注意并加以克服。目前党内已对类似的对历史的危害性的曲解引起了尖锐的注意了。
    以特莱乔·科斯托夫为代表的民族主义倾向之所以成为一个极其严重的危险，第一，它是在保加利亚党已经纠正了由对九月九日以后事件的估计所造成的错误之后发生的；第二，因为它不是在对某一个别的事件的估计上表现出来的，而是在对保加利亚党的一个基本的政治路线的估计上，即在保加利亚对苏联与联共党的关系上表现出来的。
    以特莱乔·科斯托夫为代表的民族主义的倾向的危险性又为这一事实所加强着，即科斯托夫本人的容忍与怂恿明目张胆的反苏无理行动和反苏情绪，是与其极端错误的，违反马克思列宁主义组织原则的领导党与管理国家的实际工作方法相结合的。
    党察觉到这已经不是特莱乔·科斯托夫的某一个别的错误——不论是怎样严重的个别错误，只要他诚心诚意地承认错误并努力改正是可以纠正的——科斯托夫所代表的路线乃是建立在表现最明显的民族主义偏向的基础上，建立在危害党与国家的对党领导方法采取反布尔什维主义的态度的基础上的有系统的政治错误。公开讨论与当众批评特莱乔·科斯托夫的行动已经成为完全必要了。
    一系列的不容争辩的事实证实着这一点：
    当保加利亚施行了目的在于防止英美及其他国家的间谍接触到对我国独立有重要意义的资料和情报的国家机密法后，特莱乔·科斯托夫以部长会议副主席的资格竟亲自下令对苏联的代表有效适用这一法律。科斯托夫的这一行动露骨地表现出了对苏联，对与保加利亚处于最亲密的政治经济关系——这种关系表现出了两国的国家制度与相互关系的社会主义的实质——的国家的不信任。
    特莱乔·科斯托夫事先甚至竟未报告政治局或保共党中央即自作主张做出了这一决定。
    尽管苏联和保加利亚的贸易关系是建立在最充分的互相信赖，不存在任何“秘密”、任何奸商狡诈的基础上的，但特莱乔·科斯托夫却有系统地对苏联的商业代表隐瞒了保加利亚卖给资本主义国家的某些商品的价格。只是在政治局的一个委员证实了实行多年的由科斯托夫颁布的有关隐瞒价格的指令确凿具在以后，他才承认了这一事实。这一指令的存在，证实了特莱乔·科斯托夫在对苏联关系的问题上的罪恶行为由来已久，并已根深蒂固了。
    必须联系到对目前整个国际形势的估计才能对这些事实做出政治上的判断。
    我们亲眼看到了穷凶极恶的帝国主义发动反苏运动。这一运动的目的乃是企图动摇各民族对苏联的信任，企图破坏苏联的国际威信，在精神上孤立苏联，并准备反对苏联的帝国主义的侵略战争。在现时对苏联的关系恰恰是帝国主义与反帝国主义阵营的分界线。这种关系丝毫不爽地判明着某一国家、某一政府或某一社会政治集团是属于那一个阵营的。
    帝国主义者同时又进行反对苏联的朋友——反对一切新民主国家的运动。目前正对我们的共和国，对同苏联保持着忠实的友谊的国家，施放最阴毒的暗箭。帝国主义者千方百计地恐吓我们，同时公开庇护铁托托洛斯基集团，并允以各种援助，力图用这种手段愚弄我们，要我们相信只有反对苏联才能从帝国主义者的仇视下拯救保加利亚。
    根据上述事实季米特洛夫同志本年一月十八日在保共中央政治局会议上对特莱乔·科斯托夫的行动做出了完全正确的判断。季米特洛夫同志将这一行动叫做反苏行动（这一点事实上连科斯托夫自己也承认了）。科斯托夫的行动的所以成为反苏行动是在于：仿佛目的在于反对保加利亚的敌人的国家机密法，可以在某种程度上牵连到保加利亚和苏联的关系上；这种不信任，这种设想苏联会给保加利亚的国家利益带来损害的可耻的假定，乃是一种对苏联的露骨的仇视态度。
    科斯托夫声称：在同苏联谈判中隐瞒某些商品价格的动机是为保加利亚的商业利益。但是谁不知道如果我们同苏联的贸易是建立在我们同资本主义国家现在建立的同样的贸易原则的话，那末，我们老早就碰到了不可克服的困难，走到经济破产的悲惨道路了。
    仅仅由于苏联的坚强有力的帮助，才使我们安然度过了最危急的年代，并在今天提高了我国的经济水平，以满怀信心建设着社会主义的基础。苏联与保加利亚两国关系的社会主义的特点，消除了对苏联的任何形式的国家秘密。
    无须对特莱乔·科斯托夫的路同铁托集团的目前政策作完全的对比，但必须指出：南斯拉夫离开苏联的联盟加入了帝国主义阵营，恰恰是以拒绝向苏联通报关于南国的经济及其他情况开始的（当时南国的代表——德热拉斯、卡特尔及其他人等正在苏联，曾有充分可能取得并已取得了一切情报）。
    特莱乔·科斯托夫尖刻地批评了党内领导中的破坏集体原则的行为（过火的，超过了事实与需要的批评）。但他却利用自己的地位企图将集体领导变成达到个人私欲的诡计。他独断专行地决定了对党与国家有重大意义的问题。他以“自己的”的一套方法在党内实行了包拿巴尔特主义（军事领袖独裁，创始人为拿破仑三世，包拿巴尔特是拿破仑三世的名字——译者）。
