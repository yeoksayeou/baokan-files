　　Vice Minister Lü Zhengcao Reports on Business Conditions
　　The conference continued at 3:00 PM, with Vice Minister Lü Zhengcao reporting on the state of railway operations.

　　Vice Minister Lü first pointed out that the purpose of restoring the National Railway Workers' Union is to unite railway workers across the country and bring into play the fighting spirit of revolutionary traditions, transforming the fighting power against the enemy into the fighting power for production and construction – a major transformation – and striving to build a nationwide, interconnected railway network.

　　He then pointed out that in the past three years, the employees of the people's railways have stood at the forefront of the battle, playing an active and important role in supporting the front lines. Not only has railway traffic in the liberated areas been rapidly restored (the railways already in operation total 15,711 kilometers, linking the five major liberated areas into one), but also the efficiency of railway operations is steadily improving. As a result of implementing the responsibility system, the efficiency of railway operations has significantly improved, thus ensuring the smooth and early completion of the transport tasks of the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, it has guaranteed the country's passenger and freight transport, promoting production development and commodity circulation. However, until now, the policy of relying on workers on the railways has not been clearly defined enough, and the responsibility system has not been universally established. On the contrary, the bad style of bureaucracy and the chaotic phenomenon of no one taking responsibility still exist to a considerable extent in some areas and departments, hindering the progress of the people's railway work. Therefore, our current focus should be and must be to mobilize employees, eliminate bureaucratic work styles, establish a personal responsibility system, and eliminate the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility.

　　Vice Minister Lü then gave a clear explanation of the spirit and essence of the responsibility system. He pointed out that in order to eliminate the chaotic phenomenon of no one taking responsibility on the railways and establish a responsibility system, the following things should also be done at present:

　　(1) Respond to Minister Teng's call and launch the "Mao Zedong" and Li Yong movements on all railways. Promote Li Yong's working methods to all railway work departments and establish a systematic system in which everyone is responsible for everything.

　　(2) Adjust wages and personnel.

　　(3) Vigorously encourage leading cadres of all levels of organs and departments to go out of the organs to the front lines, on the one hand, to contact reality, and on the other hand, to discover new creations of the masses in the process of labor. As long as they are vital and in line with the direction of the people's railways, no matter how small, they must be commended, rewarded, promoted, and popularized, so as to create a vigorous and enterprising new atmosphere for the people's railways.

　　(4) Universally promote learning. Workers with practical experience should learn theory and culture, and technical personnel and experts with theoretical accomplishment should learn practice, combining theory with practice. Political workers and guarantee workers should learn business and technology, and business personnel should prevent pure technical viewpoints and learn politics to understand the laws of the country's undertakings. Only by carrying out such universal learning can the people's railway work advance systematically and step by step.

　　"Who should we learn from?" Vice Minister Lü pointed out that we should mainly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and also from the scientific achievements created by the working people of capitalist countries. It is recommended that trade unions at all levels on the railways universally run various training classes on business technology, political science, and culture, turning the entire railway into a university for 380,000 employees, so as to cultivate a large number of new types of railway cadres.

　　Finally, Vice Minister Lü emphasized that the people's railways must establish a new work style that conforms to the interests of the people, that is, a new work style that is neither conservative nor reckless, seeks truth from facts, and is meticulous, accurate, tenacious, and practical, to replace the corrupt and conservative bureaucratic work style, so as to complete our arduous and great tasks under the banner of Chairman Mao and respond to the hopes of the Chinese people for us.

　　The Provisional Representative Conference of Railway Workers across the country received a congratulatory telegram from all the employees of the Huanggu Tun Rolling Stock Factory in Shenyang on July 2, stating: "In order to celebrate the opening of the Representative Conference, all workers rushed to repair a standard No. 638 locomotive and newly manufactured 25 triple valves, 5 distribution valves, 2 dead beds, revived a fire truck, and repaired a locomotive boiler outside the plan. The staff also went to the site to assemble two freight cars, two bogies, and other voluntary work in addition to completing their own work. The cold steel wheel factory made another 100 cold steel wheels outside the plan as a gift to the Representative Conference." All the representatives were very excited about their practical actions to celebrate the opening of the conference and sent a reply to respond to their call and learn from them.

　　吕正操副部长报告业务情况
    午后三时大会继续举行，由吕正操副部长报告铁道业务情况。
    吕副部长首先指出恢复全国铁路总工会的目的，在于团结全国铁路职工，发挥革命传统的战斗精神，把反对敌人的战斗力量，变为生产建设的战斗力量——这是一个大转变——为建设联贯全国四通八达的铁路网而奋斗。
    跟着指出三年来人民铁道的员工，站在战斗的前列，对于支援前线起着积极的重要的作用。解放区铁路不仅迅速恢复通车（已经通车的铁路共为一万五千七百一十一公里，把五大解放区联成一片），铁路运用效率，也在蒸蒸日上，由于实行了负责制的结果，铁路运用效率，已有显著提高。因此就保证了解放大军运输任务的顺利提前完成。同时保证了国家的客货运输，促进了生产发展与货物流通。但是，一直到现在，在铁路上依靠工人的方针还不够明确，负责制还没有普遍建立起来，相反的官僚主义的恶劣作风和无人负责的混乱现象，在某些地区，某些部门还相当严重的存在着，阻碍着人民铁道工作的前进，因此目前我们的工作重心，应当是而且必须是发动职工，肃清官僚主义作风，建立专人负责制，消灭无人负责的现象。
    吕副部长继对负责制的精神和实质作了明确的解说。并指出为了消灭铁路上无人负责的混乱现象，建立负责制，在目前还应当做的几件事情：
    （一）响应滕部长的号召，在全路上开展“毛泽东号”李永运动。把李永的工作方式，推行到铁路上一切工作部门中去，建立一套有系统的人人负责事事负责的制度。
    （二）调整工资，调整人事。
    （三）大力提倡各级机关一切部门的领导干部，走出机关到现场去，一方面接触实际，一方面发现群众在劳动过程中新的创造，只要是有生命力的符合于人民铁路方向的，不管是如何微小，都必需加以表扬奖励，提倡推广，以便把人民铁道造成一种生气勃勃奋发前进的新气象。
    （四）普遍提倡学习。有实际经验的工人要学习理论和文化，有理论修养的技术人员专门家要学习实际，把理论与实际结合起来，政治工作和保证工作人员要学习业务与技术业务人员要防止单纯的技术观点，要学习政治懂得国家事业的规律只有展开这样普遍的学习，才能使人民铁道工作有系统地有步骤地向前迈进。
    “向谁学习呢？”吕副部长指出主要是学习苏联的先进经验同时要学习各资本主义国家劳动人民所创造的科学成果。建议铁路上各级职工会普遍开办业务技术和政治文化的各种训练班，把整个铁路变成三十八万职工的大学校，以大量培养新型的铁路干部。
    最后，吕副部长着重号召，人民铁路必须树立一种符合于人民利益的新作风。就是既不保守，又不冒失，实事求是，细致、准确、顽强、切实的新作风，去代替腐朽、保守的官僚主义作风。以便在毛主席的旗帜之下，完成我们艰巨伟大的任务，回答中国人民对我们的希望。
    全国铁路职工临时代表会议七月二日接到沈阳皇姑屯车辆工厂全体职工的贺电称：“为了庆祝代表会议的开幕，全体工友赶修一台标准号机车六三八号，并在计划外新造出三动阀二十五台，分配阀五台，二台死床，复活一台消防车，修一台机车锅炉。职员们也在完成自己的工作外，到现场装两台货车，两台车架和其他义务工作，冷钢轮厂在完成计划外，又作一百个冷钢轮，作为向代表会议的献礼。”全体代表，对他们用实际行动来庆祝会议的召开，感到非常兴奋，并复电响应他们的号召，向他们学习。
