Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd – Private industries in Tianjin that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are gradually recovering and developing. This is a significant change after Tianjin further implemented the general policy of taking into account both public and private interests, labor and capital, developing production and promoting economic prosperity. From April 23 to the end of May, 490 companies applied for business registration. The China Rubber Factory, which had been closed down after the Japanese surrender, the Guanghua Dyeing Factory, which stopped production in 1947 due to losses, and the China Match Factory, which closed down before liberation, have all resumed operations. In the Third District alone, 50 of the 65 small weaving factories that had previously suspended production had resumed work by the end of May. Heji, Tianfeng, Keming and other three glass factories, and Zhenhua Paperboard Company are actively preparing to resume work. In addition, Dongya Wool Weaving Company is planning to set up a branch, and Baotou Pulp Mill is also actively preparing for establishment. Existing factories, such as cigarette, match, and flour mills, have added nearly 200 workers. Many factories in the rubber, weaving and dyeing, hardware smelting, machinery, bakelite, and cigarette industries are adding machinery and expanding their business. In terms of output, many factories have also increased. In May, Sanmin Weaving Factory increased its monthly output of cloth from 300-400 bolts before liberation to 610 bolts. Yongming Chemical Plant increased its monthly output of hydrochloric acid from 400 jars before liberation to 600 jars. Tongxin Calcium Carbide Plant increased its daily output from 650 jin before liberation to over 900 jin. Sales have also generally increased. In the rubber industry, Yuhua Factory booked 12,000 tire futures, and Zhenzhong and Dongchang factories each booked 10,000 pairs of rubber shoes. In the hardware smelting industry, Jufuchang Iron Pot Factory sold an average of 8 tons per ten days in April, and sold more than 12 tons in the first ten days of May.
    The main reason for the rapid development of private industry in Tianjin is that the leading organs of Tianjin have further implemented the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit and developing production, and improved labor-capital relations. After Comrade Liu Shaoqi, one of the responsible persons of the CPC Central Committee, summoned capitalists in Tianjin for discussions and thoroughly clarified the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government on developing production, capitalists had a clearer understanding of labor-capital relations, eliminated or reduced doubts, and improved their management enthusiasm. At the same time, the trade unions also conducted more in-depth education for workers, and improved workers' political awareness and policy level, so that they realized that only by actively developing production under the principle of labor-capital mutual benefit can they better improve their lives. As the labor and management clarified the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit, and the People's Government and the trade unions rationally solved some specific problems between labor and management, labor disputes were significantly reduced. For example, during the Dragon Boat Festival in the old lunar calendar, very few labor disputes occurred. This played a promoting role in the restoration and development of production. Secondly, state-owned enterprises have planned to support the production of private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. For example, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company allocated 1,068 pieces of yarn to the weaving and dyeing industry in mid-May, the department store ordered goods from the knitting, weaving, and rubber industries, the Grain and Oil Company generally processed flour on behalf of flour mills, and the People's Government organized a wheat purchase and flour sales committee, and the Yarn and Cloth Exchange to help some capitalists solve some difficulties in raw materials and sales. The Bank of China issued a total of more than 13 million yuan in loans to 38 export manufacturers such as carpets and egg products in mid-May, and the Bank of Communications issued more than 210.3 million yuan in order loans, discount loans, and fixed-term loans in May, totaling more than 61 million yuan. The Cooperative Department loaned more than 41 million yuan to handicrafts. The People's Government has also rationally adjusted coal prices, further promoted trade between urban and rural areas, conducted industrial registration, issued business licenses, and confirmed the legal status of private industries. These have played a great role in the recovery and development of private industries.

### 进一步贯彻劳资两利方针　津私营工业逐步发展

　　进一步贯彻劳资两利方针
  　津私营工业逐步发展
    【新华社天津二日电】天津有利于国计民生的私营工业逐步恢复和发展。这是津市进一步贯彻执行公私兼顾劳资两利发展生产繁荣经济的总方针之后的显著变化。从四月二十三日至五月底，即有四百九十家申请营业登记。在日寇投降后即歇业的中国橡胶厂，在一九四七年因亏本停工的光华染厂和在解放前歇业的中国火柴厂等已开工复业。仅三区内过去停工的六十五家小织布工厂，至五月底，就有五十家复工。和记、天丰、克明等三个料器厂和振华纸版公司等都在积极地准备复工，此外，东亚毛织公司正在筹设分厂，包头纸浆厂亦在积极筹备成立中。原有的工厂，如卷烟、火柴、面粉等业增加了近二百工人。橡胶业、织染业、五金冶炼业、机器业、电木业、卷烟业等中不少工厂都在增添机器，扩大营业。在产量方面，许多工厂也都有增加。五月份中，三民织布厂由解放前月产布三百匹到四百匹，增加到六百一十匹。永明化学厂由解放前月产盐酸四百坛，增加到六百坛。同心电石厂由解放前日产六百五十斤，增加到日产超过九百斤。在销货方面一般地也有增加。橡胶业如钰华工厂订出期货一万二千付车胎，震中、东昌两厂各订出一万双胶鞋。五金冶制业，如聚福昌铁锅厂四月每旬平均销八吨，五月上旬即销到十二吨多。
    天津私营工业迅速发展的主要原因，是津市领导机关进一步贯彻执行了劳资两利发展生产的政策，改善了劳资关系。中共中央负责人之一刘少奇同志在津召集资本家谈话，透辟地阐明了中国共产党和人民政府关于发展生产的政策以后，并使资本家更明确地认识劳资关系，消除或减少了疑虑，提高了经营情绪。同时，职工会也对工人进行了较深入的教育，提高了工人的政治觉悟和政策水平，使他们认识到目前只有在劳资两利的方针下，积极发展生产，才能更好地改善生活。由于劳资双方明确了劳资两利的方针，并经人民政府和职工会合理地解决了劳资间的一些具体问题，劳资纠纷显著减少，如在旧历五月节，即很少发生劳资纠纷事件。这对恢复与发展生产起了推进作用。其次是国营企业有计划地扶助了有利国计民生的私营工业的生产。如花纱布公司五月中给织染业配纱一千零六十八件，百货公司对针织、织布、橡胶等业定了货，粮油公司普遍地由面粉磨房代磨加工，人民政府又组织了购麦销粉委员会，纱布交易所等帮助部分资本家解决了部分原料和销路等困难。中国银行对地毯、蛋品等三十八家出口厂家五月中曾共放款一千三百余万元，交通银行五月份发放了定货贷款二亿一千零三十余万元及折实贷款、定期放款等六千一百余万元。合作部对手工业贷款四千一百余万元。人民政府又合理地调整了煤价，进一步沟通了城乡贸易，举办了工业登记，发给营业执照，确定了私营工业的合法地位等，这些都对私营工业的恢复发展起了很大作用。
