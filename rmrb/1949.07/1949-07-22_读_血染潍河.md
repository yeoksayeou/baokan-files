　　Reading "Blood Stained the Wei River"
　　Lü Ying
　　On the vast land of China, hundreds of millions of people have stood up.
　　However, overthrowing the feudal ruling class of thousands of years and destroying the shackles of thousands of years is not a simple and easy task. It is an arduous and bloody struggle.
　　"Blood Stained the Wei River" (written by Dong Junlun) is a story about such a struggle.
　　In the Jiaodong Liberated Area, on the banks of the Wei River, there was a village called Qujia Village. This village had a total of about one hundred and fifty households. After the establishment of the new government, the farmers struggled against the traitors and evil landlords, and only then did they live a stable life. "But out of nowhere, a thunderbolt struck! The Kuomintang bandit army attacked!"
　　When the bandit army attacked, they first used airplanes, artillery shells, and machine guns to strafe the fleeing masses. When they caught up, they used broadswords to chop and bayonets to stab. "Piles of corpses were everywhere, and blood flowed into the river. In the blink of an eye, the river water turned red."
　　The bandit army entered the village and then began to rape and plunder. Fortunately, most of the village cadres and ordinary people had been evacuated. Following on the heels of the bandit army, the landlord armed home-returning corps also returned to the village, and then began the inhuman massacre.
　　Honorary soldier Qu Defa was beaten to death, and the Women's Rescue Association chairperson was captured and had her hair burned. "Then they pulled over two cows, tied one rope to her foot and another to her neck, and beat them hard on both sides, forcibly tearing her head off." — The woman who told this story reached out to pick the wick of the soybean oil lamp, and tears dripped onto her hand…
　　But this was only the beginning. Zhang Heizi, the pseudo-village chief of the home-returning corps and the son of the evil tyrant Zhang Bopi, in order to "get rich, buy an official position, find a beautiful girl, and enjoy happiness," beat Li Laohan to death for not being able to pay the fine, forced Liang's daughter, whom he had robbed, to her death, and Qu Keyin, an old man who could not borrow food to redeem his son, was also forced to hang himself. Qujia Village was plunged into darkness. The landlords were not willing to give up like this. They "discussed wiping out all the hired and poor peasants in the village, as well as the village cadres, martyrs, soldiers, and workers' families who were 'on the side of the Eighth Route Army'." They held a settling-accounts meeting. Zhang Heizi said plainly, "You poor wretches, you divided our land and our grain. Today we will settle accounts with you." Village Chief Qu was tied to a tree, his ears were cut off, his eyes were gouged out, and he was burned alive. His wife "rushed over like a madwoman, and the bandits took the opportunity to push her in as well, and then tossed in a few more handfuls of grass. The fire burned more and more fiercely, and the smell of smoke and charred human flesh filled the yard." Girl Du Fang was beheaded. Fourteen-year-old Liang Xiaowen and his father were buried alive…
　　However, the reply of the revolutionary cadres and peasants was resolute. Du Fang said, "Kill me if you want." Liang Xiaowen said, "Carry the revolution through to the end." Village Chief Qu hoarsely shouted "Long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!" as he died! Those who had not been harmed by the landlords, such as Du You, joined the Boji Palm Work Team and, under the leadership of Instructor Huang, fought to the death with the Chiang bandit army and the evil landlords.
　　The work team went to the villages at night to post slogans, deliver letters, and shout slogans. One night, they sneaked into a village and rescued twenty-five encircled peasants. A few days later, they went to Zhang Heizi's home at night and killed this leader of the evil landlords. But then another village chief was sent, a Waimuzizi who was even more ferocious than Zhang Heizi. The work team used a plan to eliminate this great scourge. The struggle persisted and unfolded until the main force of the People's Liberation Army returned and liberated this area.
　　During the struggle, the pseudo-district chief, because of repeated failures, transferred his anger to the people. He ordered the district team to drive all the people rounded up from the villages to the beach of the Wei River. "He wanted to watch with his own eyes the shootings, live burials, beheadings,铡刀铡 (铡刀铡 can be translated as beheading with a铡刀 which is a specific blade used to behead people) and burning." The beach, which used to be a place for people to cool off and chat, had now become a killing field. "On the killing field, there were blood-stained rags, women's hair, skulls, and sun-baked, swollen, legless, and armless corpses... Blood stained the beach red in patches."
　　Blood also stained the Wei River red.
　　Simply and solemnly, the author wrote this story of bloody battle.
　　In this story, the author grasps the battle as the center, makes every effort to move towards the direction of truth, does not intersperse redundant twists and turns in the plot, does not simply imitate the narrative methods of old novels, nor does he directly transplant colloquialisms and dialects into the work. The author uses language from life, carefully tempered, to truthfully express the people and life, and from this comes the author's clear and bright style. Although, if we demand a full view of the battle process in relief and diverse typical characters of the people, there are slow steps in this aspect, the writing power is also weak in some places, and the picture also has static plain strokes, the author is using all his strength to hold the pen and is working hard towards the direction of depth and breadth, and is also pouring his whole heart into it. It is precisely because of this that the author's concise and clear brushstrokes have the reason for being solidified and heavy.
　　"Blood Stained the Wei River" clearly shows how the people's revolutionary struggle, under the leadership of the Communist Party, won victory in a resolute, heroic, and bloody battle, and shows the great and invincible strength of the people's revolution in the new China; and how they grew up in the battle and moved forward in the battle, one after another.

### 读“血染潍河”

　　读“血染潍河”
    吕荧
    在广大的中国的土地上，几万万人民翻了身了。
    但是，推翻几千年来的封建统治阶级，摧毁几千年来的枷锁，这不是一件简单容易的事，这是一个艰苦的血的斗争。
    “血染潍河”（董均伦著）就是这样一个斗争的故事。
    在胶东解放区，在潍河边上，有一个曲家庄。这个庄子总共有一百五十来户人家，新政权建立后，农民斗争了汉奸、恶霸地主，才过着安稳的生活。“可是平地起了一个霹雳，国民党匪军打来了！”
    匪军进攻的时候，先用飞机炮弹和机枪扫射逃难的群众，等到赶了上来，就用大刀劈，用枪刺，“死尸一堆一堆的，血，流到河里，转眼间，河水变成红色。”
    匪军进了村子，接着就是奸淫虏掠，幸好村干部和老百姓大部份都转移了。跟在匪军的尾巴后面，地主武装还乡团也回到村子里，于是开始了惨无人道的屠杀。
    荣誉军人曲德发被打死了，妇救会长被捉住，烧了头发，“又拉过两条牛，把她脚上绑一条，脖子上绑一条，狠命的往两边打，硬把头就这么挣掉了。”——讲这件事的女人，说到这里，伸手去剔豆油灯上的灯花，泪水滴在她的手上……
    但是，这不过只是开始。还乡团的伪乡长张黑子，恶霸张剥皮的儿子，为了“发财，买官，漂亮姑娘，享福”，他打死了没有钱交款的李老汉，逼死了抢来的梁家姑娘，借不到粮食赎儿子的老头子曲可印也被逼着上了吊了。曲家庄闹得暗无天日。地主们并不肯就这样甘休了的，他们“商议干掉全村的雇贫农，和‘八路上’的村干部、烈、军、工属”。他们开了一个倒算会，张黑子说得明白：“你们这些穷棒子，分了我们的地，分了我们的粮食，今天要和你们算帐。”曲村长被他们绑在树上，割了耳朵，剜了眼睛，用火活活的烧死；他的女人“疯了似的抢过去，匪徒们就势把她也推进去，又撩上了几把草，火越烧越猛，烟火气加着烧焦的人肉味，充满了院子。”杜芳姑娘被他们铡下了头。十四岁的梁小文和他的爹一起被活埋了……
    但是，革命的干部和农民的回答是坚决的。杜芳说：“杀就杀吧。”梁小文说：“革命革到底”。曲村长临死时嘶哑的喊着“共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！”没有遭到地主们毒手的如杜有这些人们，都去参加了簸箕掌的武工队，在黄指导员领导下面，和蒋匪军和地主恶霸作生死的斗争。
    武工队夜里到村子里贴标语，送信，喊话。有一天晚上摸进村子，救出了二十五个被圈起来的农民。过了几天，夜里到了张黑子的家里，杀掉了这个地主恶霸的首领。但是接着又派来了一个乡长，那是一个比张黑子还凶的歪嘴子。武工队又用计除掉了这个大害。斗争坚持着，展开着，直到人民解放军的主力回来，解放了这个地区的时候。
    在斗争的期间，伪区长因为接连的失败，把愤怒都转移到老百姓身上，他吩咐区队把从各村里圈来的老百姓统统的赶到潍河的沙滩上，“他要亲眼看着枪毙、活埋、刀砍、铡刀铡、火烧。”从前平时乘凉说笑的沙滩，如今变成了杀人场。“杀人场上，有的是沾血的破布，女人的头发，骷髅，还有晒的黑漆漆的、肿泡泡的、缺腿断胳膊的尸首。……血把沙滩染的一片一片的红。”
    血把潍河也染红了。
    素朴地，沉重地，作者写下了这个血的战斗的故事。
    在这个故事里，作者把握住战斗做中心，全力向真实的方向突进，没有穿插多余的曲折的情节，也不是单纯的模仿旧小说的叙述方法，也没有照直的把口语土话搬进作品，作者用从生活里来的语言，经过深思的洗炼，真实地表现人民和生活，从这里产生了作者明洁和清朗的风格。虽然，如果要求浮雕的战斗过程的全貌，多彩的典型的人民性格，在这方面有迟滞的步子，笔力也有弱的地方，画面也有静态的素笔，但是作者是用全力执着笔，向着深和广的方向努力，而且是以全心倾注着的。也正是因此，作者简洁明朗的笔触才有凝滞沉重的原因罢。
    “血染潍河”明确的表现了人民革命斗争怎样在共产党领导之下，在坚决的英勇的血的战斗里获得了胜利，表现了新中国人民革命的伟大的不可战胜的力量；以及如何前仆后继地在战斗中成长，在战斗里前进。
