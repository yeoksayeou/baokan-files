    [Ping City News] The Preparatory Committee for the First National Congress of Natural Science Workers of China continued its meeting on the 15th. In the morning, the conveners of the four groups, namely science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, reported on the opinions discussed by their respective groups. They unanimously agreed that the joint organization of national natural science groups of a trade union nature and local branches should be established promptly. Representatives to participate in the new CPPCC should be nominated by each group and produced through consultation, with the principle of emphasizing academic expertise and contributions to the democratic movement, while also taking into account age, region, and various natural science fields. The method for electing representatives to the First National Congress of Natural Science Workers of China should be divided into four departments: science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, with universal suffrage by region, and consideration given to departments within the People's Liberation Army.

    In the afternoon, Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, attended the conference and reported on the general situation of industry, agriculture, transportation, and water conservancy in North China, as well as his expectations for natural science workers. He Cheng reported on the "Work and Activities of Natural Science Workers in the Old Liberated Areas." He summarized how, over the past twenty-two years of the people's liberation struggle, natural science workers closely and intensely cooperated with the needs of the people's struggle, contributing their wisdom, labor, and even lives under extremely difficult conditions to win the victory of the People's Liberation War, and continuously developing and improving themselves. He also pointed out that all these achievements were obtained thanks to the correct and strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the support of the broad masses of the people.
