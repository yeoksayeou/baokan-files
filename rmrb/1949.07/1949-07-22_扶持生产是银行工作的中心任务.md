　　Supporting Production is the Central Task of Bank Work
　　General Manager of the People's Bank of China Nan Hanchen

With the liberation of the entire North China region, developing production has become the overriding central task. Our bank's work policy must undergo a timely shift. From supporting decentralized small-scale production, developing small agriculture and handicrafts to achieve regional self-sufficiency for more than a decade, we must shift to vigorously restoring industrial production; promoting agricultural production of more grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods; organizing and promoting urban-rural exchange; and establishing foreign trade that protects production and benefits both domestically and internationally. From currency struggles against the enemy, which focused on seizing the market, we must shift to vigorously supporting exports and engaging in foreign exchange work that serves production entirely, gradually realizing the business policy of unified and centralized financial work, adjusting capital, opposing speculation, and stabilizing finance.

Because we have occupied large cities and control large-scale industrial production, control seaports, and opened up foreign trade, and transportation is gradually recovering, the urban-rural isolation and mutual antagonism caused by the war have been eliminated. These circumstances have caused a series of changes in urban and rural production. First, the production of native cloth, small-scale salt, saltpeter, native alkali, and native soap and cigarettes, which we vigorously promoted during the war, has decreased due to lack of sales; so-called slow-moving goods such as bristles, eggs, peppercorns, furs, mountain products, and medicinal materials, which previously had no or limited sales, are rapidly recovering because they can be exported. This change is inevitable and beneficial. We should help the vast number of producers to approach this major transformation with greater awareness and organizational planning, reduce the painful processes of transformation, reduce losses, increase income, and raise farmers' purchasing power and living standards to promote the recovery of industrial production and the smooth development of the national economy. Therefore, the bank's main tasks in the cities at present are to help industrial recovery, support export trade, and promote the exchange of industrial and agricultural products between urban and rural areas. To this end, the following is necessary:

One, vigorously support exports and eliminate foreign exchange speculation. Foreign trade should adhere to the principle of balancing imports with exports, mastering and rationally using limited foreign exchange for urgent economic construction needs. Based on this policy, we must improve our foreign exchange management and operation, make supporting exports one of the bank's main businesses, issue export loans, assist in the production, transportation, and sales of export goods, solve their funding difficulties, and eliminate the foreign exchange black market currently generated in "barter" in foreign trade. The determination of foreign exchange rates should be based on the principle of benefiting the bulk (in terms of value) export goods among all export goods (excluding those under unified sales) at the time. If the export of a few slow-moving goods is unfavorable, the state trading company or the bank can try to subsidize them. Exchange rates should be managed according to this principle. Through production loans from various branches and inland exchange, the foreign exchange operations supporting production in the interior and supporting exports at the seaports should be closely linked, and their planning should be gradually enhanced, and each of our foreign exchange should be used rationally and economically for the urgent needs that truly help independent and autonomous economic construction. Anything we can achieve through self-reliance or find substitutes for does not require the supply of foreign exchange, so it cannot be imported to protect our national industry.

Two, in order to accelerate the recovery of industrial production, we must handle industrial loans. The policy for industrial loans is, first and foremost, to meet the needs of state-owned industries, while also providing certain assistance to private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Under the principles of developing production, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both public and private sectors, we should help them solve the difficulties of capital shortages. The experience of the Tianjin Bank of Communications in supporting private industries through methods such as purchasing products, placing orders, and granting loans based on real value has proven to be a better method that conforms to the aforementioned principles of supporting production and benefiting both public and private sectors.

Three, the smooth flow of domestic exchange has a significant impact on the exchange of goods in the interior. Now, except for the Northeast, the national currency is unified, regions are connected as a whole, and transportation is gradually recovering. The conditions for developing domestic exchange are all in place. We should widely develop domestic exchange to facilitate production, transportation, and sales, and organize and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas through warehousing, trust, insurance, and other businesses.

Four, strengthen financial management: Trade agencies, banks, and industrial and commercial departments must work closely together and resolutely crack down on all speculative activities to clarify the financial market and provide favorable conditions for the recovery and development of production. The main task here is to manage floating capital, organize and guide floating capital to industries that are beneficial to production, and encourage private banks and firms to shift towards supporting production.

Five, issue large amounts of agricultural and sideline product loans to restore and develop agricultural production. If the problems of a lack of agricultural products (grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods) and low farmer purchasing power are not resolved, the recovery and development of urban industry and commerce will also be difficult to achieve due to insufficient raw materials and poor sales of industrial products. Our agricultural loan business should help solve these problems. At present, many rural sideline occupations, such as manual textile, saltpeter boiling, salt drying, and other production activities, have stagnated, and farmers' incomes have therefore decreased; at the same time, new production income has not yet been obtained. In order to encourage farmers to increase the production of industrial raw materials and export goods, it is even more necessary to help agricultural production from the perspectives of trade and banking. Therefore, it is necessary to invest a large amount of agricultural loans to solve the difficulties of capital shortages in agricultural production as much as possible. According to years of agricultural loan experience, adhering to the principle of dedicated funds for specific purposes and directly lending the means of production needed by the masses is most beneficial to production. It can not only ensure that loans are truly used in the needed production industries (such as water conservancy and cotton planting), but also increase the production income of the masses and ensure the repayment of loans, to achieve the goal of considering both public and private interests. In the past, the method of "light rain evenly distributed" according to administrative divisions, which had egalitarianism and a relief perspective, had too little effect on production. We should be good at using this experience to promote agriculture through various loan organizations, produce more grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods, change the regional self-sufficient economy, strengthen urban-rural ties, develop a unified national economy, and thereby increase rural purchasing power to promote industrial development.

The main task of the North China Regional People's Bank in the second half of the year is to vigorously organize the connection between inland production and foreign exchange work through winter loans and other loans, to effectively stimulate inland production, master a large amount of foreign exchange, and supply the imported equipment necessary for economic construction; through the development of loans and domestic exchange, promote urban-rural exchange, and restore industrial and agricultural production. Our other tasks are to strive for the successful completion of this central task.

Restoring industrial and agricultural production and raising farmers' purchasing power to ensure smooth sales of industrial products are the top priorities at present. To achieve these tasks, first of all, there must be the organization, planning, and leadership of the state-owned economy, but this alone is not enough. State-owned enterprises, private enterprises, production cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives must work together. The bank, in this process of production, transportation, and sales, organizes public and private capital, and based on the principle of developing production and benefiting both public and private sectors, first cooperates with state-owned enterprises, followed by cooperatives and private enterprises, and provides necessary and possible assistance in terms of funds, so that the construction of the new democratic economy can rapidly move forward.

　　扶持生产是银行工作的中心任务
    中国人民银行总经理  南汉宸
    华北全境解放，发展生产成为压倒一切的中心任务，我们银行工作方针就要有适时的转变，从十余年来扶持分散的小生产，发展小农业、手工业，达到分区自给的方针，转变为大力恢复工业生产；推进农业生产更多的粮食、工业原料和出口物资；组织与促进城乡交换，建立保护生产、内外互惠的对外贸易。从以争夺市场为主的对敌货币斗争，转变为大力扶持出口，完全为生产服务的外汇工作，逐步实现金融工作的统一集中、调剂筹码、反对投机、稳定金融的业务方针。
    由于我们占有了大城市和掌握了大规模的工业生产，掌握了海口，打开了对外贸易，交通逐渐恢复，战争所造成的城乡隔离和互相对立的形势消除了，这些情况在城乡生产中引起了一系列的变化，首先是我们在战争时期所大量提倡的土布、小盐、火硝、土碱及土产肥皂、纸烟等生产，因无销路而减产；过去无销路或销路不畅的所谓冷货如猪鬃、打蛋、花椒、皮毛、山货、药材等则因能出口而在迅速恢复中，这种变化是必然的，有利的，我们应帮助广大生产者在这一大转变中，带上更多的自觉性，和组织计划性，减少转变中某些痛苦过程，以减少损失，增加收益，提高农民的购买力和生活水平，以促进工业生产的恢复和国民经济的顺畅发展。因此目前银行在城市中的主要任务是帮助工业的恢复，扶持出口贸易，和促进城乡工农产品的交流，为此必需：
    一、大力扶持出口，杜绝外汇投机。对外贸易应本量出为入的原则，掌握和合理使用有限的外汇于经济建设的急需上，本此方针来改进我们的外汇管理和经营，把扶持出口作为银行的主要业务之一，发放出口贷款，协助出口物资的生产运销，解决其资金困难，取消目前对外贸易在“易货”中所产生的外汇黑市。外汇价格的规定，应以当时全部出口物资（除统销外）中大宗的（从价值上看）出口品有利为原则。若有少数冷货出口不利，可由国家贸易公司或银行设法贴补之，汇价应本此原则加以管理，通过各分行的生产贷款及内地押汇，把内地扶持生产与海口扶持出口的外汇经营密切联系起来，并逐渐增强其计划性，合理而节省的使用我们的每宗外汇于真正有助于独立自主的经济建设的急需上。凡我能自力更生或能觅致代用品的，就不需要供给外汇，使其不能进口，以保护我们民族工业。
    二、为了加速工业生产的恢复，我们要办理工贷，工贷的方针，首先和主要的是满足国营工业的需要，同时对有益国民生计的私营工业亦应给以一定帮助。在发展生产、公私兼顾、公私两利的原则下，帮助其解决资金短缺的困难。天津交通银行用收购产品、定货、折实贷款等方式扶助私营工业的经验，证明是符合上述扶持生产、公私两利原则的较好的办法。
    三、内汇的畅通，对内地物资交流的作用甚大，现在除东北外全国货币是统一的，地区都连成一片，交通也逐渐恢复了，开展内汇的便利条件都具备了，我们应广泛的开展内汇，以便利生产运销，并通过仓库、信托、保险等业务以组织和促进城乡的物资交流。
    四、加强金融管理：贸易机关、银行和工商部门要密切结合，坚决打击一切投机活动，用以澄清金融市场，为生产的恢复与发展提供有利条件。这里主要就是管理游资，组织与疏导游资到有利生产的事业中去，并鼓励私营行庄转向扶植生产。
    五、大量发放农副业贷款，以恢复和发展农业生产，农产品（粮食、工业原料及出口物资）缺乏和农民购买力低下的问题如不解决，则城市工商业的恢复和发展也将受到原料不足工业品销路不畅而难于实现的。我们的农贷业务应该协助解决这些问题。现在有许多的农村副业，如手工纺织、熬硝、晒盐等生产停滞，农民收入因此减少；同时新的生产收入尚未获得。为着奖励农民增产工业原料及出口物资，从贸易、银行各方面来帮助农业生产，就更有必要。所以必需投放大量农贷，尽可能的解决农业生产资金缺乏的困难。根据年来农贷经验，本专款专用方针，直接贷放群众所需的生产资料，对生产最为有利。不仅能保证贷款真正用到需要的生产事业上（如水利植棉等），并可以增加群众的生产收入，保证贷款的归还，以达到公私兼顾的目的；过去按行政区划“普降小雨”带有平均主义、救济观点的办法则对生产作用太小。我们应当善于运用这一经验，通过各贷款组织推动农业，生产更多的粮食、工业原料和出口物资，改变分区的自给经济，密切城乡联系，发展统一的国民经济，从而提高农村购买力，以促进工业发展。
    下半年华北区人民银行的主要工作是通过冬贷和其他贷款，大力组织内地生产和外汇工作的联系，以达有效刺激内地生产，大量掌握外汇，供应经济建设所必需的进口器材的目的；通过贷款和内汇的开展，促进城乡交流，以恢复工业农业生产，我们的其他工作都是为了这个中心任务的圆满进行而努力。
    恢复工业农业生产，提高农民的购买力，以保证工业品的畅销，是目前的首要事情，要达成这些任务，首先要有国营经济的组织计划和领导，但是仅仅这样还是不够的，必须公营企业、私营企业、生产合作社、供销合作社共同努力，银行则在这种生产运销过程中，组织公私资本，根据发展生产公私两利的原则，首先和公营的，其次和合作社及私营的企业合作，在资金上予以必要和可能的帮助，使新民主主义的经济建设迅速向前推进。
