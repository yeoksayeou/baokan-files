    Congress Declaration
    The National Congress of Literature and Art Workers, having convened in the people's capital—Beiping—for fourteen days, is now drawing to a close. This congress was attended by a total of six hundred and forty-eight members, including representatives from all aspects of the Chinese literary and artistic circles. This congress symbolizes the unprecedented unity and great victory of the Chinese people. Without the great victory of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, such a congress would not have been possible.
    The congress proceeded throughout in an atmosphere of harmony, joy, and excitement, listening to and discussing the political report of Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, the general report of Guo Moruo on the literature and art of the new China, and the reports of Mao Dun and Zhou Yang on the literary and artistic revolutionary movements in the Kuomintang reactionary-controlled areas and the liberated areas; it initially summarized the work experience of various departments and regions; adopted the charter of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, which stipulated the programmatic aims and tasks; discussed more than one hundred constructive proposals; elected the national committee members of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and established a unified organization for national literary and artistic work. The gains of this congress are enormous.
    The Chinese People's War of Liberation has achieved a basic victory. The new Political Consultative Conference is about to be convened. This new Political Consultative Conference includes representatives from all democratic classes and all democratic parties and people's organizations. A new people's democratic government will be born as a result. This is a new era for the Chinese people. The long-term fate of the Chinese people being enslaved and exploited is coming to an end. From now on, the motherland will embark on the broad road of independent, free, and peaceful construction. We support the convening of this new Political Consultative Conference and the democratic coalition government produced by it. At present, the remaining reactionary forces in the country are still making a final struggle, and we must eliminate all overt or covert bandits; complacency towards the enemy is a crime against the people.
    Our motherland has experienced a long period of war, and the vast war zones are full of devastation, and the people's lives are very difficult. In the future, in order to heal the wounds of war and gradually improve the people's lives, we must first restore and develop production. Promote the heroism of the Chinese working people! Promote the spirit of labor and sacrifice for the benefit of the people! Since our people have won victory in fighting against powerful enemies, they will certainly be able to achieve victory in overcoming new difficulties!
    The victory of the Chinese people is inseparable from international assistance. If the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries in Europe had not contained the forces of Anglo-American imperialism in the West, it would not have been possible for China to defeat the US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique in the East. Imperialism and its lackeys will not be reconciled to this defeat. The essence of imperialism is political enslavement and economic plunder of other nations, and war is the means to achieve this goal. This is the reason why war-mongers advocate and incite new massacres. Oppose the war plot of the US imperialism and its accomplice's aggressive group! We firmly stand in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the socialist Soviet Union, promote the spirit of revolutionary patriotism and internationalism, and strive for lasting world peace and people's democracy!

    大会宣言
    全国文学艺术工作者代表大会，在人民的京城——北平，经历了十四天的会议，今天闭幕了。参加这个大会的成员，共有六百四十八人，包括了中国文学艺术界各方面的代表人物。这个大会，象征了中国人民的空前的团结与伟大的胜利。假如没有中国共产党领导下的中国人民的伟大胜利，这样大会，是不可能举行的。
    大会始终在和谐、愉快与兴奋的空气中进行，听取了并讨论了周恩来副主席的政治报告，郭沫若的关于新中国文学艺术的总报告，茅盾、周扬关于国民党反动派统治区文艺革命运动与解放区文艺运动的报告；初步地总结了各个部门，各个地区的工作经验；通过了全国文学艺术界联合会的会章，在这个会章里，规定了纲领性的宗旨与任务，讨论了一百多件富有建设性的提案；选举了全国文联的全国委员，成立了全国的文学艺术工作的统一组织。这个会的收获是巨大的。
    中国人民解放战争，已取得基本的胜利。新的政治协商会议即将召开。这个新的政治协商会议包括了各民主阶层和各民主党派与人民团体的代表。新的人民民主的政府将随之而产生。这是中国人民新的纪元。中国人民长期被奴役与被宰割的命运是要终止了。从此之后，祖国将走上独立、自由与和平建设的康庄大道。我们拥护这个新的政治协商会议的召开与由他而产生的民主联合政府。目前，国内残余的反动势力仍在作最后的挣扎，我们必须肃清一切或明或暗的匪徒；对敌人的麻痹，就是对人民的犯罪。
    我们的祖国经历了长期的战争，广大战区满目疮痍，人民生活十分困苦，今后为了医治战争的创伤和逐渐改善人民的生活，首先必须恢复与发展生产。发扬中国劳动人民的英雄主义！发扬为了人民的利益而奋不顾身的劳动和牺牲精神！我们的人民既然在与强大敌人作战取得了胜利，也一定能在克服新的困难中取得胜利！
    中国人民的胜利是和国际的援助分不开的。假如没有苏联和欧洲各新民主主义国家在西方牵制了英美帝国主义的势力，就不可能有中国在东方击败美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动派的胜利。帝国主义和他的走狗是不会甘心这种失败的。帝国主义的本质就是对于其他民族的政治奴役与经济掠夺，而战争就是达到这个目的的手段。这就是为什么战争贩子们鼓吹与煽动新的屠杀的理由。反对美帝国主义及其帮凶的侵略集团的战争阴谋！我们坚决站在以社会主义苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营里，发扬革命的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，争取世界的持久和平与人民民主！
