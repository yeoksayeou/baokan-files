Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th – The Shanghai Military and Police Joint Office cracked a "Central Training Corps" spy organization planted by Chiang Ching-kuo at the Fishing Administration Office on Fuxing Island (on the Huangpu River) before fleeing Shanghai on June 30th. Eight spies were arrested, including Sun Ping, Ni Ya'yi, Li Baijiang, Li Deling, Huang Ruiyun, Chen Jiajun, Yang Pi'yan, and Ni Andong. Seven letters written by Chiang Ching-kuo, two revolvers and bullets, cameras, fake IDs, and other items were seized. Spy Sun Ping, using the position of "Inspector" of the Fishing Administration Office as a cover, was responsible as the leader of the "Central Training Corps" sabotage team. He participated in a secret four-person meeting held by Chiang Ching-kuo at the Broadway Mansion before leaving Shanghai, where he arranged spy sabotage work. Ni Ya'yi was the head of the "Central Training Corps" and deputy leader of the sabotage team. Around the liberation of Shanghai, she smuggled 27 rifles and more than ten telephones and radios out of Fuxing Island and buried them, sent away Li Zhiwen, the Kuomintang traffic police captain, and carried out sabotage activities such as stealing armbands from the People's Security Team, stealing public supplies, and spreading rumors. Li Baijiang and Li Deling both appeared as editors of "New Fishing Monthly." They burned fishing boats and Fuxing Island pier bridges on the eve of the liberation of Shanghai. After the capture of this group of spies, Zhou Baifu, a trusted spy under Chiang Ching-kuo, immediately brought a revolver and letters written to him by Chiang Ching-kuo to repent and surrender. Two other spies, Liu Shaotang and Zhang Bingsheng, also surrendered at the same time with their credentials.

　　蒋匪经国阴谋破产
  　沪破获匪特组织
    已捕获特务孙平等八名
  　蒋匪亲信特务三名自首
    【新华社上海十二日电】上海军警联合办事处于六月三十日破获蒋匪经国于逃离上海前在复兴岛（在黄浦江）渔管处布置下的“中训团”特务组织，捕获匪特孙平、倪雅宜、李白江、李德龄、黄瑞云、陈嘉俊、杨丕颜、倪安东等八名，搜出蒋匪经国亲笔信七封、左轮枪两支及子弹、照像机、假证件等物。匪特孙平以渔管处“视察”的职务作掩护，负责“中训团”破坏小组组长，曾参与蒋匪经国离开上海前在百老汇大厦召开的四人秘密会议，布置特务破坏工作。倪雅宜为“中训团”负责人兼破坏组副组长，在上海解放前后，将长枪二十七支及电话、电台十余部偷运出复兴岛埋藏，遣走匪特伪交通警察中队长李治文，并进行偷窃人民保安队臂章，偷运公家物资和造谣等破坏活动。李白江、李德龄皆以“新渔月刊”编辑面目出现，曾于上海解放前夕烧毁渔船及复兴岛码头桥梁。该批特务落网后，蒋匪经国手下亲信特务周百扶即携左轮手枪与蒋匪经国给他的亲笔信件前来悔过自首，另两名特务刘少棠、张炳生亦同时携带证件自首。
