　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 21st: The complete liberation of mainland Zhejiang occurred as follows: After the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River in late April, they divided into two routes in early May to bravely pursue the fleeing Kuomintang bandit troops. One PLA route advanced into Zhejiang from the Anhui-Jiangxi border. Within half a month, they successively captured over thirty counties, including FenShui, Dongyang, Yongkang, Lishui, Qingtian, Qingyuan, Jiangshan, Kaihua, Jinhua, Longyou, and Quzhou, sweeping across central and southern Zhejiang. They annihilated the bandit provincial security command and its subordinate security third brigade, fifth brigade, most of the bandit 106th Army's 192nd Division, most of the 17th Army Group's 318th Division, the 85th Army's 110th Division, the Ninth Training Command, and one regiment of the 45th Army's 102nd Division, among others. Another PLA route entered Zhejiang from Langxi and Guangde in southern Anhui. After victoriously liberating northern Zhejiang, this unit advanced south along the Beijing-Hangzhou highway at a speed of one hundred li per day, liberating Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province, on May 3rd. In mid-May, this route of the PLA, centered on Hangzhou, divided into three routes, advancing east, south, and southeast. The eastern PLA route crossed the Cao'e River along the Hangzhou-Ningbo road, advancing towards Ningbo. Within nine days, they liberated Shangyu, Yuyao, Cixi, Fenghua, Ningbo, Zhenhai and other county towns, capturing over 3,000 bandits from the 87th Army and nine detachments from the Ningbo Self-Defense Headquarters. The PLA advancing south reached Wenzhou on May 25th, joining forces with the People's Liberation Army Southern Zhejiang Guerrilla, who had persisted in fighting behind enemy lines for fourteen years. In mid-June, this route of the PLA, in coordination with local people's armed forces, liberated Linhai. On June 25th, they liberated Haimen, annihilating 1,400 bandits from the Southern Zhejiang Administrative Office and other units at Tuoxia Bridge. The third PLA route advancing towards southeastern Zhejiang advanced through Shaoxing, Shengxian, and Fenghua towards Xiangshan Port and Sanmen Bay. On May 22nd, they annihilated a battalion of the 220th Division of the 87th Army north of Shengxian, and eliminated over 5,000 bandits in the mountainous areas, thwarting the Kuomintang bandit army's attempt to organize resistance in the mountainous areas of Zhejiang. Starting on July 5th, this PLA unit launched an offensive against the Kuomintang bandits entrenched on the Xiangshan Peninsula. Within five days, the entire peninsula was liberated, annihilating most of the 660th Regiment and part of the 648th Regiment of the 220th Division of the 87th Army, most of the Second Battalion of the Ninth Traffic Police Corps, totaling over 2,500 people. By this point, all seventy-seven counties in Zhejiang, except for Dinghai, had been liberated. Simultaneously with the advance of the People's Liberation Army field army, the people's guerrilla forces in various parts of Zhejiang, who persisted in fighting behind enemy lines, actively cooperated with the main forces in combat, successively liberating the county towns of Taishun, Shaoxing, Zhuji, Yuhuan, Wenzhou, Ruian, Pingyang, Wenling, Huangyan, and others. Currently, the Zhejiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army has been established, with ten military sub-districts under its jurisdiction. It is currently clearing out scattered bandits who are roaming in the mountains. As of the end of June, over 8,000 bandits and puppet remnants have been annihilated or surrendered.
