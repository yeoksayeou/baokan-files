　　[Hebei News] With the support of state-owned stores and the People's Government, the swine bristle industry in Shenze County, Hebei Province, has been revived from the brink of collapse. The local swine bristle industry has a 50-year history, with the villages of Nanying, Dong, Xiguluo, Nanmulu, Beimulu, Liangcun, and Youwei being the most prominent. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, swine bristles were transported from Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, and Suiyuan, processed here, and then shipped to Tianjin for export. At its peak, Nammulu and Beimulu saw over three million jin of pork pass through each year. During the spring and winter seasons, no fewer than thirty merchants from Baoding's Deyiheng, Tianjin's Longmao Foreign Firm, and Nanjing would reside here to purchase bristles. Many farmers depended on this for their livelihood, with some villages entirely reliant on it. However, they were manipulated and deceived by small merchants and large traders, often resulting in losses. Furthermore, the middle and poor peasants frequently suffered due to the squeeze from landlords with substantial capital.

　　With the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Japanese occupied major cities, cutting off trade between urban and rural areas. Later, the construction of blockhouses throughout Hebei led to the collapse of the swine bristle industry in Shenze County. The lives of those who depended on it deteriorated year by year, with many resorting to eating bran and wild herbs. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the state-owned Raw Fur Department and state-owned Yijuxing began purchasing swine bristles, leading to the revival of the industry in Shenze. However, many people lacked capital and remained unable to operate effectively. Last spring, the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank loaned 25 million Border Region currency to Guluo and Nanying, and some private capital was also brought in, allowing them to start purchasing bristles from Shandong, Henan, Shanxi and other provinces. The profit margin was relatively large last spring and summer, coupled with the establishment of purchasing groups by state-owned Yijuxing in Nanying and Beimulu, which bought bristles at fair prices, the swine bristle industry in Shenze gradually recovered and developed. According to incomplete statistics from last year, over 18,600 jin of large bristles were exported, approximately 5 million jin of pig hair was purchased, and over 260,000 jin of "maoliu" (semi-finished products) were manufactured by combing. People reflected, "With Yijuxing buying bristles, our lives have a reliable foundation."

　　In addition to state-owned leadership and support, in order to rapidly restore and develop the swine bristle industry, the three villages of Xiguluo, Nanying, and Beimulu organized seven "maodian" (bristle shops), formed by collective investment of the masses. They elected several dedicated individuals to be responsible for operations and transactions and to lead women's sideline handicraft production in the entire village. Staff lived in the shop, and profits were distributed among the staff and shareholders according to a three-seven or four-six split (capital accounted for six or seven tenths). Every family in these three villages held shares. Guluo village also absorbed shares from neighboring villages, totaling 838.35 million yuan (Border Region currency). Recently, Hongxing Maodian in Mulu settled accounts for half a year, with a profit of 64,000 yuan per 10,000 yuan invested. Last year, the two maodian in Beimulu purchased 500,000 jin of pig hair, which was processed into 260,000 jin of maoliu by women in the village. The average manual labor fee was 6,000 yuan per jin, totaling 1.56 billion yuan. In Xiguluo, more than 300 of the 400 households went out to buy bristles during the slack season. Some practiced mutual aid between agriculture and sideline occupations, with four or five or seven or eight families forming a group, pooling their money, and jointly selecting one or two experienced people to go out to purchase bristles. The rest of the group helped them with farming at home, and the profits were shared by everyone. There were 25 such groups in Beimulu. In addition, making maoliu from pig hair leaves half of the material as waste, of which one half of the better feathers can be made into hair rope, and the remainder of the pig hair is used as fertilizer, which is even better than soybean cake. Coupled with the fact that everyone has a share of land after land reform, the lives of the people in this area are increasingly moving from poverty to prosperity.

　　There are still several issues that need to be resolved in the development of the bristle industry in Shenze: (1) The state-owned purchases are still too few, failing to meet the demands of the people. (2) With the exception of a few technicians with high skills, the state-owned bristle purchasing staff have low technical skills, unable to distinguish between good and bad goods, not paying enough for good goods and overpaying for bad goods, which affects the improvement of quality. A group of specialized talents should be trained, or a group of local insiders should be promoted to become staff. (3) The state-owned Yijuxing does not have close contact with the local Party, government, and economic departments, making it difficult to obtain assistance from others. (4) The maodian are cooperative in nature and should not distribute dividends. Dividends can be converted into shares to expand capital, which is beneficial to the entire village. (5) In addition to increasing the number of wooden knives, the tools for combing hair are still old and need to be improved. Some women add water to the maoliu, which is calculated by the jin, and this needs to be corrected. (6) In Beiguluo, some villagers are deceiving other villagers in speculation and profiteering and this must be corrected immediately.

　　国营商店公平收购成品
  　深泽鬃毛业复活
  　经营上还需要多方改进
    【冀中讯】冀中深泽县的鬃毛业，在国营商店与人民政府扶植下，由死复生。该地鬃产业有五十年历史；以南营、东、西古罗、南、北木楼、良村、油味七村为最多。抗日战争前，鬃毛从山东、河南、山西、绥远地处运来，经过这里制造，运往天津出口。南、北木楼最多时，每年来往猪肉上过三百万斤。保定的德义恒、天津的隆茂洋行、南京的客商们，春冬两季不下三十家住在这里安庄收买。农民依此为生的极多。有的村是家家户户依此度日。可是，他们却受着小商、大客商们的操纵，欺骗，常常闹得赔本。加上本大钱多的地主们的排挤，中贫农更时常吃亏。
    抗战开始了，日本占了各大城市，断绝了城乡贸易；冀中后来到处修上炮楼，深泽县的鬃毛就垮了台。依此为生的人民，生活一年不如一年，吃糠咽菜的很多。石家庄解放后，国营元皮毛部与国营义聚兴开始收买鬃毛，从此深泽鬃毛业又开始复活，但许多人没资本，仍活动不开。去年春天，晋察冀边区银行贷给古罗、南营边币两千五百万元，又带出来一些私资，开始到山东、河南、山西等省去购买鬃毛。去年春夏利润较大，又加上国营义聚兴在南营、北木楼设组掌握，按正常的价格收买鬃毛，深泽的鬃毛业乃得逐渐恢复发展。去年不完全的统计，输出大鬃一万八千六百余斤，购来猪毛约五百万斤，经制造梳成毛柳（半成品）二十六万多斤。人民反映：“有了义聚兴收鬃毛，生活就有了依靠。”
    除国营领导与扶植外，为迅速恢复发展鬃毛业，西固罗、南营、北木楼三村组织了七个毛店，由群众集股而成，推选出若干专人负责经营成交等，并负责带动全村妇女副业手工生产，职员生活在店里，赚了钱职员按三七或四六分红（资本占六、七成）。这三村家家有股，固罗村还吸收了邻村的股。共计股金八亿三千八百三十五万元（边币，下同）。最近木楼鸿兴毛店半年结帐，每万元盈利六万四千元。北木楼两个毛店去年循环购来猪毛五十万斤，经木村妇女手工制成毛柳二十六万斤，每斤前后平均六千元的手工费，共计得手工洋十五亿六千万元。西固罗农闲时，四百多户就有三百多户出外买鬃。有的是农、副业互助，四五家或七八家结成小组，将钱凑到一块，公推有经验的一二人出外去购买，家里的庄稼活大伙帮他做，赚了钱大家分。北木楼象这样小组就有二十五个，此外，猪毛制造成毛柳，每百斤可剩下一半废料，其中二分之一较好的羽毛做成毛绳，下余二分之一猪毛做了肥料，比豆饼还强。加上土改后每人有一份土地，所以这一带人民的生活日益由贫困走向富裕。
    深泽的毛鬃业发展中还有几个问题应该得解决：（一）现在国营还是收买少，赶不上人民的要求。（二）国营收买鬃毛的职员除少数技术较高外，其实技术很低，看不出好坏货，好货不多出钱，坏的不少出钱，影响到质量的提高，应训练一批专门人材，或在当地提拔一批内行人做职员。（三）国营义聚兴与当地党、政、经济有关部门联络不密切的也难得到别人的协助。（四）毛店是合作社性质的，不应分红，可以将红利入股，扩大资本，对全村都有好处。（五）梳毛的工具除增加木刀外，还是旧的，也需改进。有的妇女将水渗在毛柳上，按斤计工，也需纠正。（六）北固罗弄大鬃，有的本村人骗本村人投机倒把，应立即纠正。
