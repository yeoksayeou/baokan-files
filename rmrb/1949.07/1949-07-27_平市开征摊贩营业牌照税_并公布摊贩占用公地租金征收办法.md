Peiping News: Peiping's work on reorganizing street vendors and opening up new markets has now come to an end. During the reorganization process, and in future construction to enrich the facilities of the new markets and repair streets, funds are needed everywhere. The Municipal People's Government, in accordance with Article 6 of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Street Vendors" attached to the City Character No. 7 Proclamation, has formulated the "Provisional Measures for the Business License Tax on Street Vendors" and will levy a business license tax on street vendors. The measures stipulate that all street vendors operating in the inner and outer city and suburbs of the city (businessmen in Dong'an, Xidan, Quanye and other shopping malls are regarded as seated businessmen), regardless of whether they have fixed places, shall be levied business license tax in accordance with these measures. Licenses are divided into three categories according to the amount of capital and the nature of the business: tax-exempt business licenses, ordinary business licenses, and special business licenses. All street vendors must register with the street vendor management office in their jurisdiction ten days before opening for business, and may only operate after obtaining a license. The total amount of capital is reported by the taxpayer, assessed by the street vendor management office and the street vendor assessment committee, and the license level and the amount of tax payable are determined. The business license tax is collected quarterly, divided into seven levels, and the tax amount is: for capital (RMB) of 10,000 yuan to less than 15,000 yuan, 200 yuan is collected per quarter; 15,000 yuan to less than 20,000 yuan is 300 yuan; 20,000 yuan to less than 25,000 yuan is 500 yuan; 25,000 yuan to less than 30,000 yuan is 700 yuan; 30,000 yuan to less than 35,000 yuan is 1,000 yuan; 35,000 yuan to less than 40,000 yuan is 1,500 yuan; 40,000 yuan to less than 50,000 yuan is 2,500 yuan. The collection time is in the middle of February, May, August and November. If the business period is less than one quarter, it will be calculated on a monthly basis, more than 15 days will be calculated as a full month, and less than 15 days will be exempt from collection. Street vendor licenses are scheduled to be renewed once a year. Spring and summer have passed, and no additional tax will be levied. Street vendors who are reorganized on the spot will be levied from July 1st, and street vendors who have moved to the newly established markets will be exempt from land rent for two months from July 1st.

Peiping News: The Peiping Municipal People's Government, in accordance with Article 5 of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Street Vendors," has recently announced measures for collecting rent for street vendors occupying public land. The rent is collected once a month, with millet as the unit of calculation. The area of public land occupied is based on a land number of three feet wide and six feet long as the calculation standard. It is divided into seven levels according to different locations, and the highest rent is the special level, which refers to the areas where temporary stalls are permitted by the Municipal Government. These areas are all reorganized streets, where stalls are generally prohibited, but in order to take care of some vendors who do not rely on passing pedestrians for business, such as snacks, fruits, bicycles, etc., who are temporarily allowed to set up stalls, it is stipulated that each land number shall pay a monthly rent of 30 catties of millet. The lowest is the sixth level, such as Xihuangchenggen, Nanheyan, Xiannongtan New Market, Dongxi Houheyan and other places, where each land number pays a monthly rent of 2 catties of millet. Those who operate in night markets established under the leadership of the government shall pay half of the rent. Newly opened markets in designated locations are exempt from land rent for two months from July 1st. This rent is collected daily by the street vendor management office.
