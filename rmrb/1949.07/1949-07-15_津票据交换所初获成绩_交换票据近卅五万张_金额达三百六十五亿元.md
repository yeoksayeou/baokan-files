Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 14th: The Tianjin Bill Exchange, under the management of the People's Bank, has achieved initial success in stimulating Tianjin's financial activity since its restoration on March 1st. As of the end of June, over 130 banking institutions in the city, including state-owned banks, private banks and foreign banks, had participated in the exchange. A total of nearly 350,000 various bills (checks accounted for 98%, the rest were bills of exchange, remittance slips, applications, People's Bank notes, loan vouchers, etc.) were exchanged, amounting to over 36.5 billion yuan. Comparing late June with early March, the number of exchanged bills increased from 480 to 5,070, an increase of more than tenfold; the exchange amount increased from over 150 million yuan to 6.9 billion yuan, approximately 45 times.

In order to correct past market malpractices and bring bill exchange business onto the right track, the Tianjin Military Control Commission's Financial Department issued the "Tianjin Bank and Money Shop Exchange Procedures and Precautions" when the bill exchange was established. It stipulated that the returned check difference should be made up within one hour; those who made mistakes in filling out forms, failed to pay the exchange amount or returned check amount within the stipulated time, and those who were late or disobeyed commands would be warned or suspended from exchange. If a trading firm's client issued a bad check, the trading firm with which the client had dealings should issue a written warning for the first offense. For the second offense, in addition to the trading firm immediately settling accounts with the client, the People's Bank would notify all exchange trading firms that they must not accept the client's checks within one year. Over the past four months, the People's Bank has strengthened the education of banks, trading firms and merchants to avoid returned checks due to procedural irregularities. At the same time, it has strictly enforced regulations and imposed penalties on those who deliberately disrupt the financial order and issue bad checks; those with more serious circumstances were sent to the People's Court to be fined one-half to one times the bill amount based on the amount and motive, according to law. In early May, the Military Control Commission's Financial Department also promulgated the "Bill Exchange Error Handling Measures," stipulating that if a trader discovers an error after submitting the form, they should request correction, otherwise they will be criticized, warned, or even given a demerit. Those who receive two demerits in a month will be replaced, and those with serious circumstances will have their bank or trading firm suspended from exchange. The above measures have achieved considerable results in the past four months. For example, the number of returned checks in early March accounted for approximately 40 per thousand of the exchanged checks, which had dropped to 17 per thousand by early May; in late June, the number of exchanged checks increased again, while the number of returned checks was reduced to less than half of that in early May. In addition, the People's Bank is also extremely cautious in issuing its own notes, only issuing them when cash transfers are truly needed, and strictly implementing the method of depositing cash separately in different treasuries, so the proportion of exchange notes and amounts is extremely small.

However, the phenomenon of returned checks has not yet been completely eradicated, especially during times of price fluctuations. At the same time, as the number of exchanged bills increases, there has been a slight increase in procedural irregularities. This shows that when business is busier, in addition to paying attention to preventing speculation and punishing bad check issuers, it is also necessary to pay more attention to educating the public about credit knowledge, to reduce errors in bill issuance procedures, avoid returned checks, and consolidate financial credit. The People's Bank is now making further efforts in this regard.

### 津票据交换所初获成绩  交换票据近卅五万张　金额达三百六十五亿元

　　津票据交换所初获成绩
    交换票据近卅五万张
  　金额达三百六十五亿元
    【新华社天津十四日电】天津市票据交换所，在人民银行管理下，自三月一日恢复以来，对活跃津市金融，已收到初步效果。截至六月底，全市参加交换的银钱业已有国家行局、私人行庄、及外商银行等共一百三十余家，共交换各种票据（支票占百分之九十八，其他为汇票、汇条、申请书、人民银行本票、借款凭证等）近三十五万张，金额达三百六十五亿余元。以六月下旬与三月上旬相较，交换张数由四八○增至五○七○，增加十倍以上；交换金额更由一亿五千余万元增至六十九亿元，约为四十五倍。
    为了纠正过去的市场恶习，纳票据交换业务于正轨，津市军管会金融处于票据交换所成立时，曾颁发“天津市银行钱庄交换手续及注意事项”；规定：退票差额应于一小时以内补足；填制表报有错误，不能于规定时间照付交换金额、退票金额，以及迟到或不服从指挥者，要受到警告或停止交换的处罚；交换行庄之往来户如开空头支票，第一次应由与该户有往来之行庄予以书面警告，第二次除该行庄应即与该往来户清帐外，并由人民银行通知全体交换行庄，在一年内不得收受该户之支票。四个月来，人民银行一面加强对各行庄商户的教育，以避免因手续不合，而形成的退票；一面对存心扰乱金融，乱开空头支票者，严格执行规定，予以处分；情节较重者则送人民法院依法按票额和动机处以二分之一至一倍的罚金。五月初军管会金融处又颁布了“票据交换错误处理办法”，规定交易员如交表后发觉错误应请求更正，否则将分别予以批评、警告、以至记过处分。一个月中记过两次者撤换，情节严重者停止该行庄交换。上述措施，四个月来已收到了相当的效果。如三月上旬退票张数约占交换张数的千分之四十，至五月上旬即已降至千分之十七；六月下旬交换张数再行增加，而退票张数则更较五月上旬减至一半以下。此外，人民银行发行本票，亦极慎重，确因点款需要时才开出，并严格执行了提存现金另库分存办法，故交换张数及金额所占比例极小。
    但直至目前，退票现象仍未根绝，特别是物价波动的时候。同时随着交换张数的增多，手续不合者也微有增加。这说明业务愈繁忙的时候，除应注意严防投机，处罚空头支票开出人之外，并须更加注意对群众进行信用常识的教育，以减少票据开出手续上的错误，避免退票，巩固金融信用。现在人民银行对此正进一步努力中。
