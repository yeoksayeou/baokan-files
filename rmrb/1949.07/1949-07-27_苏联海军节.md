Soviet Navy Day
"The Soviet people need to see our navy stronger and more powerful. Our people will build new ships and bases for the navy."
    Stalin
    Navy Day is one of the most familiar national holidays in the Soviet Union. On this day, warships in Leningrad, Sevastopol, Vladivostok, Polaire, Tallinn, Odessa, and other seaports will fire salutes to celebrate the navy's combat traditions and its contributions to the country. Throughout the country, crowds of people are attracted to watch or participate in naval group games, swimming, diving, naval landing demonstrations, and public celebrations. The Soviet people love their navy and highly value their contributions to the country. In the last war, the Soviet Navy won new merits and made great contributions to the victory of the anti-fascist war.
    There are many episodes in the history of the Russian Navy, in which naval officers and soldiers showed unparalleled bravery.
    Since the time of Peter the Great, the Russian Navy has been outstanding. The traditions of Russian sailors were established in naval battles such as Hangut, Haid, Chasma, Corfu, and Lavarino. For this reason, the Soviet Union established medals and awards named after the great Russian admirals Lazarev and Ushakov during the Patriotic War. In the various battles of the Patriotic War, Soviet naval personnel enhanced the reputation of their navy and demonstrated great heroism in their service to the country.
    The Soviet Navy defended the strategic flanks of the Soviet Army on the coast, resisting numerous attacks and landings by the enemy navy. During the war, the enemy had more than one opportunity to encircle or attack Soviet land forces on the coast from the sea, but the enemy's landings in the Soviet Army area were never successful.
    Sailors from the Baltic, Black Sea, Northern, and Pacific Fleets, as well as the inland river fleets, coordinated their actions with the Soviet Army.
    Nearly 300,000 naval personnel received medals and awards.
    Five hundred and eight naval personnel earned the lofty title of "Hero of the Soviet Union"; eighty-seven warships received the title of "Guards"; and two hundred and two ships received medals for outstanding service.
    In the historical battles of Leningrad, in the battles of Odessa, Sevastopol, the Caucasus, and Crimea, and in the heroic defense of the Soviet North, naval personnel showed extraordinary courage, decisiveness, and heroism.
    On a stormy, dark night in December 1941, the cruiser "Krasny Kavkaz" (now "Guards") of the Black Sea Fleet, under the command of Navy Major Alexei Gorshkov, carrying a large landing force, with guns and ammunition piled on the deck, approached the coast of Feodosia. The fate of the entire operation depended on the landing of this force.
    The enemy's artillery discovered the warship and opened fire. One shell exploded near the armory, which was loaded with tons of explosives. The armory was in danger of exploding at any time. The officers and soldiers began to throw the burning ammunition boxes into the sea; but the warship continued to anchor next to the breakwater. A total of twenty-five shells and five mortar shells hit the cruiser, and eight fires broke out, but she remained afloat and could still fight.
    Sailors of Soviet submarines also demonstrated bravery, vigilance, and decisiveness. Many Soviet Navy submarine command towers are marked with two-digit numbers, indicating the number of enemy ships sunk by that submarine in the last war. For example, the "Guards" submarine M-117 sank sixteen enemy ships; the submarine of Soviet hero Yerislav Yosile sank eighteen; and the Red Banner submarine K-21 sank seventeen.
    Soviet submarines are very familiar and loved by the Soviet people. The heroes of submarine warfare, such as the commander of a certain submarine unit, Makhommet Gayev, Navy Major Commander Islay Feshanovich, and other heroes, are known throughout the country.
    The entire crew of torpedo boats also showed great courage in the war. In one battle, Soviet heroes Nikolai Osipov and Vladimir Gumanenko sank two enemy transport ships, a destroyer, and a barge carrying many tanks. A squadron of motorboats led by Soviet hero Vladimir Alekseyev encountered an enemy fleet of thirty ships near the Norwegian coast. They launched a courageous attack on the enemy. As a result, nine enemy ships were sunk.
    Naval aircraft also earned a reputation in the last war. The Soviet Navy has the honor of the first air raid on Berlin, which was carried out by pilots of the Baltic Fleet from Osel Island in 1941. The Soviet people will never forget the brilliant achievements of naval pilots Lieutenant Colonel Boris Safonov, Major Peter Boleko, and others.
    The bravery of the Soviet Marines on the front lines of the Great Patriotic War was outstanding. They stood in the ranks of the heroic defenders of Leningrad, Sevastopol, Odessa, Stalingrad, and Moscow.
    On Navy Day, the attention of the Soviet people is focused on the issue of further rapid development of the Soviet Navy. Stalin said: "The Soviet people need to see our navy stronger and more powerful. Our people will build new ships and bases for the navy."
    On Navy Day, Soviet sailors review their combat readiness and their loyalty to the country.

　　苏联海军节
  “苏联人民需要看到我们的海军更加坚强更有威力。我们的人民将为海军建造新的船舰和基地。”
    斯大林
    海军节在苏联是人们最熟悉的全国性节日之一。列宁格勒、悉瓦斯托波尔、乌拉弟伏斯托克、波列阿莱、塔林、敖德萨和其他海港的军舰，这一天都要齐鸣礼炮，庆祝海军的战斗传统和它对国家的功勋。全国各地，成群的人们都被海军的团体游戏、游泳、潜水、海军登陆示威和公共庆祝会吸引去旁观或参加。苏联人民热爱他们的海军，并且把他们对国家的贡献估价很高。在上次战争中，苏联海军又赢得了新的功勋，对反法西斯战争的胜利贡献很大。
    俄罗斯海军史上有着许多插曲，海军官兵们在这些插曲里表现了无比的勇敢。
    从彼得大帝时起，俄罗斯的海军就已经很出色了。俄罗斯海员的传统，是在汉沽。海得、恰斯玛、科孚、拉瓦里诺等海上战役中就树立了的。为了这个原因，苏联在爱国战争中，设立了以伟大的俄国海军上将拉吉莫夫和乌沙可夫为名的勋章和奖章。在爱国战争的各次会战中，苏联海军人员又提高了他们海军的声誉，在对国家的服役中表现了伟大的英雄主义。
    苏联海军保卫着苏联陆军在海岸上的战略侧翼，抵抗着敌人海军多次的攻击和登陆。在战争过程中，敌人不止一次地可能从海上包围或攻击海岸上的苏军陆上部队，但是，敌人在苏联陆军地区的登陆，却没有成功过一次。
    波罗的海、黑海、北海和太平洋舰队及内河舰队的海员们，和苏联陆军配合行动。
    将近有三十万名海军人员得到了勋章和奖章。
    有五百零八个海军人员，赢得了“苏联英雄”的崇高称号；有八十七只军舰得到了“警卫者”的头衔；有二百零二只船舰由于服役优越而得到了勋章。
    在历史性的列宁格勒之战中，在敖德萨、悉瓦斯托波尔、高加索和克里米亚等次的战役中，在苏联北部，英雄的保卫战中，海军人员们都表现了异常的刚勇、果敢和英雄主义。
    在一九四一年十二月一个暴风雨的夜黑，黑海舰队的一只巡洋舰“克拉斯莱·卡夫卡茨”（现在是“警卫者”），在海军少校阿厉赛·戈希金统率下，载运一支庞大的登陆部队，甲板上堆集着枪炮和弹药，驶近菲奥多西亚的海岸。整个作战的命运，都决定于这支部队的登陆。
    敌人的大炮发现了这只军舰，并且开炮了。有一个炮弹在装着许多吨炸药的军火库附近爆炸了。那个军火库有随时爆炸的危险，官兵们开始把燃烧着的炮弹箱猛丢到海里去；但军舰仍继续在防浪堤旁下锚。共有二十五枚炮弹和五枚臼炮炮弹击中了这只巡洋舰，并且有八处起火了，但她仍然浮着，还可以作战。
    苏联潜舰的海员们同样表现着英勇、机警和果敢。苏联海军有许多潜艇的司令塔上写着两位的数字，标志着那只潜艇在上次大战中击沉敌人船舰的数目。例如，Ｍ一一七号的“警卫者”潜艇，曾击沉敌人船舰十六艘；苏联英雄耶维斯拉夫·约塞莱的潜艇击沉了十八艘；Ｋ二十一号的红旗潜艇击沉了十七艘。
    苏联潜艇是为苏联人民所十分熟悉和热爱的。潜艇战的英雄们，如某一个潜艇队的司令官马浩迈特·盖耶夫，海军少校指挥官依斯莱·费善诺维奇和其他的英雄们，都闻名全国。
    鱼雷艇的全体海员们在战争中也表现了很大的勇敢。在一次战役中，苏联英雄尼可莱·奥西鲍夫和乌拉地米尔·古曼南科击沉了两艘敌人运输舰、一艘驱逐舰和一艘载着许多坦克的驳船。苏联英雄乌拉地米尔·亚历塞耶夫所统率的一队汽艇，在挪威海岸附近遇见了敌人有三十只船的船队。他们向敌人发动了勇敢的攻击。结果击沉了敌船九艘。
    海军飞机在上次战争中也同样赢得了声誉。苏联海军有着第一次空袭柏林的光荣，那是一九四一年波罗的海舰队的飞行员们从奥塞尔岛出发袭击的。苏联人民将永不会忘记海军飞行员鲍利斯·萨冯诺夫中校、彼得·波列科少校等人的光辉的功勋。
    苏联的海军陆战队在伟大爱国战争前线上的英勇是出众的。他们站立在列宁格勒、悉瓦斯托波尔、敖德萨、斯大林格勒、和莫斯科英雄保卫者的队伍当中。
    在海军节，苏联人民的注意力都集中在进一步迅速发展苏联海军的问题上。斯大林说：“苏联人民需要看到我们的海军更加坚强更有威力。我们的人民将为海军建造新的船舰和基地。”
    苏联的海员在海军节，检阅他们的战斗准备和他们对国家的忠诚。
