　　Developing Export Trade through Urban-Rural Material Exchange
  　The Rapid Development of the Egg Processing Industry in North China
　　[This newspaper combined dispatches] With the development of urban-rural material exchange and import and export trade, the egg processing industry in various parts of North China has rapidly recovered and developed from a state of complete closure and shutdown before liberation, thanks to the support of foreign trade companies and state banks. The egg factories in North China are mainly distributed in Tianjin, Tangshan, Baoding, Handan, Zhangjiakou, Datong, and other places. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently eleven factories in operation, of which Handan Egg Factory is state-owned, and the rest are privately owned. The factories have a total of more than 2,000 male and female workers, and they process more than 1.6 million eggs daily. Over the past four months, the output of egg products in North China has increased dramatically. The output in March was 14 quintals (one quintal equals 200 catties), which rose to 1,036 quintals in May, and reached 2,705 quintals in the first two weeks of June.
    The export of fresh eggs from China began in 1840. Because eggs can be used for industrial production, medicine, and food, the demand from various countries is extremely high. Because fresh eggs are not easy to preserve and transport, the egg product manufacturing industry has developed accordingly (egg products include dried egg products, wet egg products, frozen egg products, and egg powder). Before the "July 7th" Incident, China's egg exports ranked fourth in the world, averaging about 600,000 quintals per year, with the main sales market being the United Kingdom, followed by Germany and the United States. Eggs and egg products produced in various parts of North China were all exported through Tianjin. According to the "Customs Import and Export Trade Design Yearbook," a total of 68,571,000 eggs and 144,264 quintals of egg products were exported in 1936. Later, due to the Japanese invasion, poultry farming in the vast rural areas of North China was severely damaged, causing a long-term separation between rural and urban areas, and materials could not be exchanged. In addition, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, land and sea transportation were completely cut off, so egg factories in various places closed down one after another. By 1946, Tianjin no longer had any egg exports. During the Kuomintang rule, the egg processing industry recovered slightly, but soon collapsed completely again.
    After the liberation of Peiping and Tianjin, the major cities of North China and the vast rural areas have been connected into one, and foreign trade officially began on March 18. The People's Government has supported the restoration of the egg processing industry in many ways. In addition to providing loans from state banks, the North China Foreign Trade Company directly signed contracts with Tianjin Lixing, Zhangjiakou Hengchang, and other egg factories, using the method of paying first and then delivering goods, to help solve the difficulties of capital and sales. Regarding the solution of raw materials, in addition to establishing egg collection stations in the surrounding countryside, the factories also went to Northeast China and Jinan to purchase raw materials with the introduction of the People's Government. Currently, with the joint efforts of labor and management, the output of each factory has generally increased, and factory equipment and construction have also gradually expanded. Take Tianjin Lixing Egg Factory as an example: in the past, the factory had 170 workers, averaging 100,000 eggs processed per day, with a monthly output of 20 tons of finished products, and each person processed an average of 588.2 eggs per day. After the resumption of work, according to the April materials: the factory already had 340 workers, processing 250,000 eggs per day, with a monthly output of 50 tons of finished products, and each person's productivity has increased by 25% compared with the past. In terms of factory construction, the machine room has increased from eight to seventeen rooms, the baking oven has increased from two to four, and a new warehouse and four work rooms have been added. Cai Ruizhai, the manager of the factory, said that this created an unprecedented production record. In order to expand production, the factory is installing new machines. After installation, the daily egg processing can be increased to 300,000 to 320,000 eggs. The factory also newly established a branch factory in Datong, which officially started operation on the 4th of this month.
    In order to enable the egg processing industry to develop substantially, the following issues still need to be resolved: 1. Universally promote superior breeds of chickens to increase egg production. The average annual egg production of chickens raised in general rural areas is only about 100, while the egg production of American chickens (translated as Laiheng chickens) trial-raised in agricultural farms in various places is very large, and should be vigorously promoted universally. In order to stimulate farmers to raise more chickens, cooperatives in various places should be responsible for purchasing eggs and importing them into cities, and give fair and reasonable prices to make it profitable. At the same time, agricultural farms or private capitalists in various places can also try to run large-scale chicken farms and engage in production using scientific methods. 2. Exported products must be standardized to improve quality. Exported goods should undergo strict inspection, and those who pass the inspection should be issued certificates for export. We must pay attention to maintaining and improving international credibility in order to open up sales channels in large quantities. 3. There is a large wage gap between men and women in some egg factories, such as Tangshan's privately owned Yixin Egg Factory, where male workers receive 10 to 15 catties of corn flour per day, while female workers receive 7 catties. Therefore, female workers have put forward a request to adjust wages. It should be resolved rationally according to the principle of equal pay for equal work, otherwise it will affect production.

　　交流城乡物资开展出口贸易
  　华北制蛋业迅速发展
    【本报综合消息】随着城乡物资交流与出入口贸易的开展，华北各地制蛋业在对外贸易公司与国家银行的扶助下，已由解放前全部倒闭歇业的状态迅速恢复发展起来。华北各蛋厂主要分布于天津、唐山、保定、邯郸、张家口、大同等地，据不完全统计，现已开工生产的共十一家，其中除邯郸打蛋厂为公营外，余均为私营，各厂共有男女职工二千余人，每日打蛋约一百六十万个以上。四个月来，华北蛋制品的输出是飞跃上升的，三月份输出量为十四公担（一公担为二百斤），五月份则升为一、○三六公担，六月上中两旬已达二、七○五公担。
    中国鲜蛋的输出始于一八四○年，由于蛋可供工业生产及医药与食用，故各国需要量极大，因鲜蛋不易保存和装运，蛋品制造业遂随之发展（蛋制品计有干蛋品、湿蛋品、冰蛋品、蛋粉四种）。“七七”事变前中国蛋的输出占世界第四位，平均每年约六十万公担，主要销售市场为英国，德、美两国次之。华北各地所产之蛋及蛋品统由天津出口，据海关进出口贸易设计年刊载：一九三六年共输出蛋六八、五七一、○○○个，蛋品一四四、二六四公担。后因日寇侵入，华北广大农村的家禽饲养遭到严重的摧残，长期使乡村与城市分割，物资不得交流；加之太平洋战争爆发后，海陆交通完全断绝，故各地蛋厂纷纷倒闭，至一九四六年，天津已没有蛋的输出。在国民党统治时期，制蛋业虽稍有恢复，旋即又全部垮台。
    平、津解放后，华北各大城市与广大农村已连成一片，对外贸易亦于三月十八日正式开始，人民政府从多方面扶助制蛋业的恢复。除由国家银行发放贷款外，华北对外贸易公司与天津利兴、张家口恒昌等蛋厂直接订立合同，以先付款后交货的方法，帮助解决资金与销路的困难。关于原料的解决，各厂除深入四乡设立收蛋庄外，又经人民政府介绍，赴东北与济南等地收购原料。现各厂在劳资双方协力下，产量普遍提高，工厂设备与建筑也逐渐扩大。以天津利兴蛋厂为例：该厂过去有工人一百七十人，每天平均打蛋十万个，月产成品二十吨，每人每日平均打蛋五百八十八点二个。复工后，据四月份材料：该厂已有工人三百四十人，每日打蛋二十五万个，月产成品五十吨，每人每日生产力已较前提高百分之二十五。在工厂建设方面，机器房已由八间增到十七间，烤炉由两座增到四座，并新增仓库一所，工作房四间，该厂经理蔡瑞斋说这是创造了空前的生产纪录。为扩大生产，该厂正按装新机器，装好后，每日打蛋可增为三十至三十二万个。该厂并于大同新设分厂一座，本月四日已正式开工。
    为使制蛋业大量发展，下列诸间题尚须加以解决：一、普遍推广鸡的优良品种，以增加蛋的产量。一般农村所养之鸡，平均年产蛋不过一百个，而各地农场所试养之美国鸡（译音称来行鸡），则产蛋量甚大，应大力普遍推广。为刺激农民多养鸡，各地合作社应负责收购鸡蛋输入城市，并给予公平合理的价格，使之有利可图。同时各地农场或私人资本家亦可试办大规模的鸡厂，采用科学的方法从事生产。二、输出品必须标准化，提高品质。出口货应经过严格的检查，合格者发给证书出口。必须注意维持与提高国际信誉，方可大量打开销路。三、有些蛋厂男女工资相差甚远，如唐山私营怡新制蛋厂，男工每日玉米面十至十五斤，女工七斤，故女工已提出调整工资的要求。应根据同工同酬的原则，进行合理的解决，否则将会影响生产。
