　　Ping Three-Wheeled Cart Drivers Union Holds First Executive Committee Meeting
  　Deploys Central Tasks for July
    [Reported by this newspaper] After the Ping Municipal Three-Wheeled Cart Drivers Union was officially established on the 27th of last month, it actively began its work. Yesterday (the 4th), it held its first executive committee meeting to discuss the central work plan for July. The decisions were: (1) to establish formal branch unions in each district (formerly preparatory committees); (2) to establish cooperative sales agencies to seek benefits for workers; and (3) to negotiate vehicle rental issues with factory owners. Over 18,000 three-wheeled cart drivers in Ping Municipality have now been organized. In the future, the union will vigorously conduct education for workers, encourage them to participate in workers' night schools in various districts, and continue to hold training classes for three-wheeled cart drivers.
