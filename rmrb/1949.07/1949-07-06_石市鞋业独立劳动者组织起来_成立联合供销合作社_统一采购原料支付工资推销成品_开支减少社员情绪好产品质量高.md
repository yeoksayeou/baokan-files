[Shijiazhuang Electric] The Shijiazhuang Cooperative Supply and Marketing Head Office, in implementing the spirit of the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Conference, has organized over 1,300 independent laborers in the city's shoe industry into a united supply and marketing cooperative. In the three months since its establishment, it has achieved remarkable results, providing new experience for transferring individual labor to collective labor production methods in other industries. The cooperative is composed of 18 shoe industry cooperatives, including more than 1,300 members. Nine staff members are democratically elected from each unit, taking responsibility for procurement, storage, accounting, and consumer departments, uniformly resolving the procurement of raw materials for each unit, payment of outside worker wages, sales of finished products, and the purchase of members' daily necessities. In addition, twelve people are elected to form a cooperative committee, leading and supervising all work of the joint cooperative. In the past, when operations were decentralized, there was competition for raw materials, driving up prices. Payment of wages to women workers who made shoe soles was not uniform, and cooperatives cut corners and used inferior materials to save money, reducing the quality of finished products. One cooperative, making 3,000 pairs of military shoes, had 2,000 pairs that did not meet standards, causing great difficulties for the development of shoe cooperatives. After this painful exploration, each cooperative realized the necessity of further cooperation. In mid-March, the joint cooperative was formed, which not only overcame the above shortcomings, but also reduced the number of cadres managing businesses in each cooperative, reducing expenses. Members' lives and work were guaranteed, work morale was improved, and the quality of products improved. In the past three months, most of the shoes produced by each branch cooperative have exceeded the quality stipulated in the contract, earning the praise of the Financial Department of the North China People's Government. Due to reasonable management, members have high confidence. Originally, in addition to salary, there was a "return" of profits in the form of a bonus. Members were unwilling to divide this money, so funds were quickly accumulated. In the past, each cooperative did not have a single sewing machine. Now, each cooperative has at least two, and some have four. Business is gradually expanding. Currently, to prevent piecework shoe making from running out of work, they are actively planning to change business objectives. A joint shoe factory has been established, where members with higher technical skills are selected from each cooperative to jointly study and supply various styles of leather and cloth shoes. A sales department has also been established to lay the foundation for future business. Members are working hard to improve technology, save raw materials, reduce costs, and establish credit in order to open up sales channels and expand business. The members are all skilled workers with frugal and simple habits. They are full of confidence in the development of their common cause. At the same time, their political awareness is also increasing. Youth League organizations are developing in each cooperative, and members hold regular meetings. Some cooperatives even have black board newspapers, appropriately using criticism and praise. They also pay attention to cultural learning, and many members have joined cultural supplementary schools. The problems that urgently need to be studied and resolved are wage standards and share dividends. When the joint cooperative was first established, workers brought their own tools or participated with a small amount of capital, and everyone started working. However, issues such as capital investment, shareholding, and tool depreciation were not carefully stipulated. Now that the business has expanded, the city's cooperative head office is helping them solve these problems.

　　石市鞋业独立劳动者组织起来
  　成立联合供销合作社
    统一采购原料支付工资推销成品
  　开支减少社员情绪好产品质量高
    【石家庄电】石市合作供销总社，贯彻华北供销合作会议精神，已将该市鞋业独立劳动者一千三百多人组成联合供销合作社，成立三月，获得显著成绩，给其他行业的个体劳动转移到集体劳动的生产方式提供了新的经验。该社由十八个鞋业合作社组成，包括一千三百多社员。由各单位民主选出九个工作人员，分任采购、保管、会计、消费各部工作，统一解决各单位采购原料、支付外工工资、推销成品及社员生活必需品的购买问题。另外再选出十二人成立合作委员会，领导和监督联社一切工作，过去分散经营时争购原料，抬高价钱，发付作鞋底女工工资不统一，各社贪便宜偷工减料，成品质量减低。有一个社，做三千双军鞋，有两千双不合格，使鞋业社发展遭到极大困难，经过这一段痛苦的摸索，各社体会到进一步合作的必要，三月中旬组成了联合社，不仅克服了以上缺点，而且在经营上减少了各社经营业务的干部，缩小开支，社员生活与工作有了保障，工作情绪提高，生产品质多有进步，三个月来，各分社的鞋多数都超过合同上规定的质量，获得华北人民政府财政部的好评。由于合理的经营，社员信心很高，原除薪金以外，规定有分红性质的“返还金”，社员们都不愿分，因而资金很快的积累起来，最多的已达到七万斤小米，过去各社，就没有一部缝纫机器，现在每社最少的有两部，多的有四部，业务正在逐步扩大中。现各社为防止包工鞋做完没有工作，乃积极筹划转变业务对象，已成立联合鞋工厂，由各社选拔技术较高的社员共同研究，试供各式各样的皮鞋布鞋，并成立推销部为将来业务打下基础。社员们正在努力提高技术。节省原料，减低成本，建立信用，以便打开销路，扩大业务，社员们都是技术工人，有勤俭朴素的习惯，他们对共同事业的发展是充满信心的。同时，他们的政治认识也日见提高，青年团组织已在各社发展着，社员们定期开会，有的社并有了黑版报，适当的运用了批评和表扬。他们对文化学习也很注意，许多社员都参加了文化补习学校。目前急待研究和解决的问题是：工资标准和入股分红等问题，当联社最初建立时，工人们自带工具，或以少数资金参加进来，大家就动手干起来，而资金入股、人股、工具折价等都没有仔细规定，现在业务已展开，市合作总社正在帮助他们解决这些问题。
