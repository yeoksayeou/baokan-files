Editor's Note: The locust plague that has spread across 103 counties and cities has been greatly reduced due to the all-out efforts to eliminate them in various regions, significantly reducing the extent of the damage. The Taihang District has achieved particularly remarkable results, worthy of emulation by other regions. However, we must not relax our efforts in the slightest, as it is currently the period when summer locusts are about to lay eggs. The slightest negligence will inevitably leave behind the root cause of autumn locusts. Therefore, all regions must remain highly vigilant and lead the masses to persevere and completely eradicate the remaining locust nymphs!

[News] The Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government has decided to send another twelve people to the Taihang District to participate in locust control work. In addition to assisting the masses in catching and killing locusts, they will further investigate the source of locusts and study methods for thoroughly eliminating them. Before departing, Zhou Ming＠, head of the Entomology Department of Peking University's College of Agriculture, and Zhong Qiqian, director of the Entomology Laboratory of the Scientific Research Institute, gave lectures at the Agricultural Department on the life history, habits, and control methods of locusts, and introduced the regions where locusts have occurred in North China over the years, as a reference for comrades going to the countryside.

　　华北人民政府派员赴太行区
  　参加治蝗研究彻底灭蝗办法
    编者按：遍及一百零三县市的蝗害，由于各地尽力剿除，已获得很大成绩，大为减少了被害程度。尤以太行区成绩显著，值得各地学习。然而，我们还丝毫也不能松懈，因为目前是夏蝗即将产卵时期，稍有疏忽，便必然留下秋蝗为害的祸根。因此各地仍须万分警惕，领导群众再接再厉，彻底灭绝残余蝗蝻！
    【又讯】华北人民政府农业部决定又派十二人赴太行区参加治蝗工作。除协助群众捕打蝗虫外，并将进一步调查蝗虫之发源地，研究彻底消灭蝗虫的办法。未出发前，曾由北大农学院昆虫系主任周明＠及科学研究所昆虫室主任钟启谦于农业部讲解蝗虫的生活史习性及其防治方法，并介绍华北历年来蝗虫发生之地区，以作下乡诸同志之参考。  （李弘）
