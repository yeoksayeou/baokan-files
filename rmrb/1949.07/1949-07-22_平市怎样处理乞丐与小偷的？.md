How Does the City of Ping Deal with Beggars and Thieves?
    Chao Qi

    The work of dealing with beggars and thieves in the city of Ping was basically completed by the end of June. This work began on May 2nd, and a total of 1,358 people, including beggars, thieves, pickpockets, and some scattered soldiers, were taken in. After examination and preliminary education, they have been dealt with separately. Among them, 69 child beggars were sent to the orphanage, including 25 who were assigned to the primary school in the orphanage to attend classes, and literacy classes are being planned for the remaining 44. 136 people were sent back to their hometowns. 516 people were sent to the old people's home, where those with some labor ability have formed cook teams, sanitation teams, and guard teams to assist the elderly and disabled beggars in handling daily trivial matters. 12 women were sent to the women's reformatory. 124 people were organized into labor brigades to go south to repair the Yellow River embankment, and 138 people went to Chahar to repair dams and reclaim wasteland. After examination, 363 others who did not meet the conditions for detention were released. Now, except for a few hidden beggars who still need to be taken in and educated, the beggar problem in the city of Ping has been largely resolved. The kind of forced begging and smashing doors and windows is gone. Merchants feel relieved, and no beggars bother them anymore. When the labor brigade passed through Andingmen, local residents said, "The Communist Party really has a way to turn hooligans and thieves into good people."

    The reason why there are so many beggars in Beiping is entirely the result of feudal bureaucratic rule. It is a social problem. Therefore, the city government's handling of the beggar problem this time is to solve it as a social problem. According to the investigation: Ping City beggars can be divided into four types: One type is professional beggars, who are relatively organized and the most cunning among beggars. They have strong hooligan habits. They become the backbone of the beggars, which is also the focus of dealing with beggars. One type is bankrupt farmers in rural areas, or fugitive landlords. One type is urban poor people, ruined households, the unemployed, and the elderly, young, orphaned, widowed, and poor people with no support, who are the most numerous. One type is scattered soldiers and family members of scattered soldiers, etc., who are fewer in number. Based on the above situation, the decision was made to deal with them by means of detention, repatriation, education and transformation, and organized labor. Among the beggars taken in, the young ones are sent to orphanages to receive longer-term education, and after being transformed, they are sent back home or learn a skill to support themselves. The elderly, weak, and disabled are sent to old people's homes, where they participate in production to the extent possible, becoming permanent social welfare institutions. All young and strong people, whether professional beggars or scattered soldiers, are given the necessary education to make them realize the shame of parasitic life and establish a labor perspective. After enlightening their initial awareness, they are collectively organized into labor brigades to engage in production and support themselves, so as to achieve the goal of thorough transformation through labor. According to the city government, the main experiences gained in dealing with the beggar problem this time are as follows: (1) Investigation and understanding work before handling is very important. Analyze the investigation materials and then decide on the guiding principles and methods for handling. The city government's policy is to take in, educate, and transform at the same time, so that they can engage in labor production, and gradually eliminate them from the restoration and development of production. Facts have proved that this is very correct. (2) In order to quickly deal with this problem, it should be treated as a shock task. The Civil Affairs Bureau, together with the Public Security Bureau, the Health Bureau, and the Disciplinary Corps, organized a Beggar Handling Committee. On the one hand, the detention institutions were expanded, and on the other hand, each department was responsible for its own work, and the upper and lower levels (city and district) were unified in their steps, concentrating on detention and handling them separately. This can concentrate leadership, concentrate cadres, and solve problems in a timely manner. It is faster and more successful to have various departments unite their forces to bear the relatively heavy tasks of detention and handling. (3) The management cadres must be good at integrating with the beggars and educating them. In addition, find some activists who have been reformed better among the first beggars taken in and assign them to the new team as squad leaders to help carry out propaganda and education. Cadres are often with them, giving them lessons and individual talks. Make them feel warm and approachable. Changed the bad impression and fear of "detention" given to them during the puppet regime. In short, take active persuasion and clear thinking as the main, and supervision as the auxiliary. This reduces their dissatisfaction and hostile thoughts. Promote the good, criticize the bad, and improve their self-esteem, which has a great effect. (4) In education, adhere to the policy of transforming education and making them participate in labor production. Based on their personal experience, find out the causes of poverty, enlighten their awareness, and point out their proper future and way out. The steps taken are: First, explain the purpose of detention to dispel their ideological concerns and stabilize their emotions. Second, for poor farmers, inspire them to complain. For fugitive landlords, inspire them to recognize the shame of their past exploitative lives. Third, help them understand the source of their pain and who their enemy is. Fourth, point out that parasitic life is shameful and establish a labor perspective. After everyone has this understanding, put forward production tasks, and they will gladly accept them. In the future, the policy of continuing to take in beggars will be adopted, and the beggars who have been taken in will be given deeper education to transform their parasitic thoughts and organize production.

　　平市怎样处理乞丐与小偷的？
    超祺
    平市处理乞丐及小偷的工作，基本上已于六月末完成。这一工作开始于五月二日，先后共收容了乞丐、小偷、抓手及一部分流散军人共一三五八人。经过审查与初步教育后，已分别进行处理。其中送入育幼所的童乞六九人，内有二十五人分别编入育幼所初级小学上课，其余四四人亦已筹办识字班。遣送回籍的一三六人。入安老所的五一六人，其中稍有劳动力的，已组成伙夫队、清洁卫生队及警戒队，辅助年老残废的乞丐，处理日常生活零碎的事情。入妇女教养所的十二人。编成劳动大队，南下修黄河堤的一二四人，赴察哈尔修坝及开荒的一三八人。其他不合收容条件经审查后释放者三六三人，现除个别隐蔽的乞丐，尚须继续收容、教育外，平市的乞丐问题大体已获解决。以前那种强乞恶讨、打碎门窗的事情已没有了。商人们感到了轻松，没有乞丐和他们打麻烦了。当劳动大队出发经过安定门时，当地居民说：“共产党真有办法，使流氓、小偷也能变成好人。”
    北平的乞丐所以这样多，完全是封建官僚统治的结果。是一个社会问题。所以，此次市府对于乞丐问题的处理，就是把它当为一个社会问题来解决的。根据调查：平市乞丐可分为四种：一种为职业乞丐，比较有组织，在乞丐中最狡猾。有浓厚的流氓习气。成为乞丐中的骨干，亦即处理乞丐中的重点。一种为农村破产农民，或逃亡地主。一种为城市贫民、破落户，失业者及老幼孤寡贫苦无倚者，为数最多。一种为散兵游勇及流散军人的家属等，为数较少。根据上述情况，决定处理的办法为收容、遣送回籍与教育改造组织劳动等。在收容乞丐中，幼小者送育幼所，给以较长期的教育，经改造后，再遣送回家或学习一技之长，使其自谋生活。老弱残废的送安老所，使在可能范围内参加生产，成为常设的社会福利机关。凡年轻力壮的，不论职业乞丐，或散兵游勇，均进行必要的教育，使其认识寄生生活的可耻，树立劳动观点。启发其初步觉悟后，即集体编入劳动大队，使其从事生产自食其力，在劳动中达到彻底改造的目的。据市府当局说：这次处理乞丐问题获得主要的经验如下：（一）处理前的调查了解工作是很重要的，根据调查材料加以分析，然后决定处理的方针与办法。市府的方针是一面收容，一面教育和改造，使其劳动生产，从恢复发展生产中达到逐渐肃清的目的。事实证明这是非常正确的。（二）为了迅速处理这一问题，当做一个突击任务来作。以民政局为主，会同公安、卫生两局、纠察总队，组织了处理乞丐委员会。一方面扩大收容机构，一方面各部门分工负责，上下（市、区）统一步调，集中收容，分别处理。这样能使领导集中，干部集中，解决问题及时。由各部门统一力量，来负担比较繁重的收容与处理任务，是比较迅速而成功的。（三）管理的干部，要善于和乞丐打成一片，对他们进行教育。另外在先收容的乞丐中找出一部分改造较好的积极分子，编入新队中去当班长，帮助进行宣传教育。干部经常和他们在一起，给他们上课及个别谈话。使其感到温暖可亲。改变了日伪时代所给予他们的对“收容”的恶劣印象与恐惧心理。总之，以积极说服、打通思想，使其自觉遵守为主，而以看管为副。这样便减少了他们的不满与敌对思想。发扬好的，批评坏的，提高其自尊心，收效很大。（四）在教育上，本着改造教育，使其参加劳动生产的方针。根据其切身的经历，找出穷困的原因，启发其觉悟，指出其正当的前途与出路。采取的步骤是：第一、首先说明收容的目的，解除其思想顾虑，稳定情绪。第二、对贫苦农民，启发其诉苦。对逃亡地主，启发其认识过去剥削生活的可耻。第三、是帮助其认识痛苦的来源，谁是其敌人。第四、指出寄生生活是可耻的，以及树立劳动观点。等到大家都有了这种认识后，提出生产任务，欣然接受。今后对乞丐问题采取继续收容方针，对已被收容的乞丐加深教育改造其寄生思想组织生产。
