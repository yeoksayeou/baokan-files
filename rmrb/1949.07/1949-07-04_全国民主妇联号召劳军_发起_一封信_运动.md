　　All-China Democratic Women's Federation Calls for Supporting the Troops
  　Launches "A Letter" Campaign
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 2nd】The All-China Democratic Women's Federation has issued a nationwide telegram calling on women to launch a "A Letter" campaign to comfort the People's Liberation Army. The full text of the telegram and the notice to local women's federations regarding specific methods for launching this campaign are as follows:
    Comrades of local women's federations, women compatriots:
    "July 7th," this glorious Anti-Japanese War Memorial Day, has arrived again. It has been four years since we defeated Japanese imperialism. Today, as the People's Liberation War is about to achieve nationwide victory and the People's Republic of China is about to be born, how excited and enthusiastic should we be to commemorate this glorious festival! Although American imperialism is helping Japanese fascists, attempting to revive them, this attempt is bound to fail. The Soviet Union, which is striving to defend world peace and democracy, has already proposed at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference that China should be invited to participate in the joint discussion of the "Treaty of Peace with Japan" in order to extinguish Japanese militarism and make it a democratic country. This announcement has been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world. We not only welcome it, but also feel unparalleled honor. Because the Chinese People's Liberation Army has fought arduously, defeated Japanese imperialism, and then defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries, this great victory is, internationally, a newly born force to defend world peace and democracy. It plays a huge role in the anti-imperialist camp led by the Soviet Union. In our joy and emotion, remembering the source, we must enthusiastically thank this incomparably heroic and powerful People's Liberation Army. We must also thank the Chinese Communist Party for creating this great army on August 1st, 1927. Therefore, we are launching a "A Letter" comforting campaign, calling on democratic women's federations and women's organizations in various places to mobilize women compatriots from all revolutionary classes to write a letter each to comfort the People's Liberation Army from "July 7th" to the "August 1st" Army Day period. Dear sisters, enthusiastically respond to this movement! (Specific methods attached below)
    Notice regarding specific methods for launching the campaign:
    (1) The democratic women's federations in each strategic area should lead the women's federations in each province and city (cities equivalent to provinces) to launch this campaign in a planned and organized manner.
    (2) The women's federations in each province and city are responsible for collecting these letters. A small "Comfort" stamp should be affixed to the upper left corner of the letters, which can be handed over to the political departments of the military regions or military sub-regions for forwarding to the political departments of the field armies.
    (3) After the women's federations in each province and city have made arrangements, they should pay attention to inspection and help solve specific problems below at any time. The women's federations can publish or broadcast many good and moving letters of comfort.
    (4) This campaign starts from "July 7th" and ends on August 10th. During this period, deliveries can continue to be made, and will be stopped after the deadline.
    (5) If there are any problems or good experiences in the process of launching this campaign, please report them to the All-China Democratic Women's Federation at any time. After the campaign is completed, the provincial and municipal women's federations are responsible for making a summary and sending it to us before September 10th.

　　全国民主妇联号召劳军
  　发起“一封信”运动
    【新华社北平二日电】中华全国民主妇联会顷通电全国妇女发起慰劳人民解放军的一封信运动，通电和给各地妇联关于发动这一运动的具体办法的通知全文如下：各地妇联同志，妇女同胞们：
    “七七”，这一光荣的抗战纪念日，又到来了。我们打垮日本帝国主义，已经四年了。在人民解放战争即将在全国胜利，中华人民民主共和国即将产生的今天，我们应该如何兴奋热烈地来纪念这个光荣的节日！美国帝国主义虽然正在扶助日本法西斯分子，企图使它复活，可是这种企图，是一定会失败的。努力保卫世界和平民主的苏联，已经在四国外长会议中提议：应邀请中国参加共同商讨“对日和约”，以便扑灭日本军国主义化，使它成为民主化的国家，这一预告受到了全世界爱好和平的人民的热烈欢迎。我们不但欢迎，而且感到无比的荣耀。因为中国人民解放军的坚苦奋斗，战胜了日本帝国主义之后，又战胜了国民党反动派，这一伟大的胜利，在国际间，是新生了一支保卫世界和平民主的力量，它在以苏联为首的反帝国主义的阵营里起着巨大的影响。我们在欢欣和感动之余，饮水思源，我们要热烈地来感谢这一支无比英勇强大的人民解放军，我们更要感谢中国共产党在一九二七年八月一日创建了这支伟大的军队，因此我们发起“一封信”的慰劳运动，号召各地民主妇联以及各妇女团体，动员各革命阶层的妇女同胞，从“七七”开始，到“八一”建军节这一时期内，每人写一封信慰劳人民解放军。亲爱的姊妹们，热烈地来响应这个运动吧。（具体办法附后）

    （三）各省市妇联布置下去后，要注意检查，随时帮助下面解决具体问题，有许多好的动人的慰问信，妇联可予以发表或广播。
