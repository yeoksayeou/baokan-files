Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Employee Li Yubin
  Violating Laws and Disciplines, Stealing Equipment, Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Li Yubin, an employee of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant of the North China Iron and Steel Company, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the Beijing Municipal People's Court for sabotaging the factory and stealing equipment. After the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was taken over, it was discovered that seven precious platinum crucibles of various sizes were missing from the coking plant's warehouse, and a thorough search yielded nothing. On May 7th of this year, Tian Guiheng, a member of the guard team on duty at the East Bianmen of the plant, noticed Li Yubin, a clerk in the coking plant's warehouse, leaving the factory carrying a package, looking flustered. He immediately questioned him and found sixty dry batteries (for flashlights) belonging to the public in his package. He was immediately detained and handed over to the 27th District Public Security Bureau. At the same time, two ball bearings and seven platinum crucibles missing from the coking plant were found in his home. Both the person and the stolen goods were handed over to the Beijing Municipal People's Court. After interrogation, the offender confessed that he had embezzled and stolen public property many times before and after Liberation. The People's Court held that Li Yubin, as a clerk of the plant, not only failed to abide by the Eight Articles of Agreement of the People's Liberation Army's Pingjin Frontline Command and hand over the equipment he had stolen in the past, but also took the opportunity of the handover during Liberation to continue to steal all the platinum utensils in the warehouse. After Liberation, he did not repent despite education. Later, on May 7th, he stole public batteries, which was considered intentional violation of laws and regulations and sabotage of factory production, and should be severely punished. It was decided to sentence him to three years of imprisonment. The guard team member who protected the factory and recovered the stolen goods was commended. (Chi)

　　石景山钢铁厂职员李玉宾
  　违犯法纪盗窃器材被判有期徒刑三年
    【本报讯】华北钢铁公司石景山钢铁厂职员李玉宾破坏工厂盗窃器材，已经北平市人民法院判处有期徒刑三年。石景山钢铁厂于接管后，发觉炼焦厂仓库中失去珍贵之白金坩锅大小七个，遍找无着。本年五月七日，厂内东便门值班之警卫队队员田桂珩发现炼焦厂仓库事务员李玉宾手提一包袱出厂，神色仓皇，当即加以查问，结果在其包袱中查出公家之干电池六十节（手电筒用），即将其扣留后送交二十七区公安局，同时在其家中搜出滚珠球两个及炼焦厂失去之白金坩锅七个，遂将人脏一并送交北平市人民法院。经审问后，该犯供认在解放前后曾贪污盗取公家物品多次，人民法庭认为李玉宾身为该厂事务员，非但没有遵照人民解放军平津前线司令部的约法八章，交出过去盗取的器材，反乘解放时之交接机会，继续盗出仓库内所有之白金器皿；解放后经过学习仍不改悔，后于五月七日盗窃公家电池，自属有意违反法令破坏工厂生产，应予严重处分。当决定判处有期徒刑三年。保护工厂查获脏物之警卫队员则予表扬。　　　　（炽）
