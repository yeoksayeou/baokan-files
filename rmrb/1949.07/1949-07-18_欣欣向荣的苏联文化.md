The Stalin Prizes are awarded annually in the Soviet Union to recognize outstanding achievements in science, research and inventions, fundamental improvements in production methods, and exceptional creations in literature and art. They were initially established in 1939 to commemorate the sixtieth birthday of Joseph Stalin, the mentor of progressive science and the leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet people. The awarding of the Stalin Prizes has become a traditional opportunity to comprehensively review the achievements and gains of Soviet socialist culture. Following this review, on April 9th and 10th, the Soviet government announced its decision to award Stalin Prizes to scientists, writers, artists, inventors, and production innovators for their achievements in 1948. The mere list of new Stalin Prize recipients, along with their titles in the government announcement and the extremely brief records of their award-winning achievements, is a striking proof of the progress of socialist culture.

The fact that remarkable discoveries, research, inventions, and improvements were made in every scientific and technical field in 1948 is astonishing. In that year, nationally acclaimed works appeared in prose, poetry, drama, film, music, painting, sculpture, and architecture. Under the capitalist system, especially in the current imperialist stage, the shackles that bind and stifle science and art, and crush and destroy the talents hidden within the people, have been shattered by the socialist society and state system. In the Soviet Union's various intellectual fields, each year brings many new and important scientific discoveries and research: physics, mathematics, technology, chemistry, biology, agriculture, medicine, economics, law, history, and linguistics. Some of these achievements are epoch-making in their particular fields.

Especially in 1948, outstanding creations arose in extremely diverse fields of knowledge—from Veksler's research on cosmic rays and Radievsky's research on electron nuclear physics, to Lyubakov's fundamental research on ancient Russia and Tolstoy's exploration of the history and archaeology of ancient Khorezm; from agricultural biology, represented by the world-renowned scientist Lysenko, which completed the main research of advanced Michurin biology, to Professor Venediktov's study of state socialist property as a legal category. Particular mention should be made of certain achievements in technical science, such as the creations of Kadymov and Babayev, which, in their respective fields, opened a new page in science, replacing the past experiential methods with analytical and proven scientific calculation methods in metal heating and the selection of elastic parts for machines and instruments.

A significant characteristic of all the creations of first-class Soviet scientists is their scientific audacity to propose new questions, while maintaining close ties with practice and the major needs of the state and the people. Eleven years ago, Stalin raised a glass to toast the science that is "not aloof from the people, separated from the people, but prepared to serve the people." This is Soviet socialist science, and this is its fundamental difference from the science of capitalist countries, where science is reduced to the position of a servant of the ruling class, against the people and oppressing the people.

Dozens of outstanding Soviet scientists, such as Academy members Bardin, Lebedev, and Nemivokin, have won the Stalin Prize for 1948 for their outstanding inventions and fundamental improvements in production methods. Listed with them on the list of winners are hundreds of designers, factory directors, engineers, and technicians, all of whom are nationally renowned inventors and promoters of remarkable progressive new production methods based on the facts of progressive science in industry, transportation, and agriculture. Among the Stalin Prize winners are a considerable number of industrial workers: Alexander Chizhink, an assistant foreman at a velvet weaving factory; Valentina Klesanova, a female shock worker at an electric light factory; locomotive driver Ivan Solovyov; milling machine workers Semyonovsky and Chebyshev; lathe operators Pogaevich, Bykov, and Denisov—and many other workers.

History proves, as Stalin said: "Sometimes it is not well-known scientists, but obscure people in the scientific world, ordinary and practical people, improvers in their fields, who illuminate new paths in science and technology."

In Soviet society, such improvement has become an ordinary and commonplace matter. A worker receiving a government prize for scientific achievement is impossible in any capitalist country; however, it is very common in the Soviet Union, where everyone's labor—worker or collective farm peasant, man or woman—works happily and creatively for the benefit of the people, and where the urgent demand for improvement dominates the thoughts and actions of millions of people.

As in previous class societies, in the capitalist system there is an impassable chasm between physical and mental labor. This chasm does not exist in socialist society. In the second stage of communism, which we are now transitioning towards, the boundary between mental and physical labor will be resolutely eliminated. This can be illustrated by thousands of examples, and the list of Stalin Prize winners is one of them: the names of ordinary workers and collective farm peasants are listed on the list alongside the names of world-renowned academicians.

The award-winning outstanding scientific creations, inventions, improvements, literary and artistic works, etc., do not come from one or two major cultural centers in the country, but from many different towns and villages in the sixteen constituent republics of the Soviet Federal Republic. The cultural achievements of the Soviet Union are the cultural achievements of Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Georgians, Uzbeks, Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, and all other nationalities that thrive under the socialist sun.

The lackeys of U.S. imperialism tirelessly promote "cosmopolitanism" in science, literature, and art, because they have discovered that "cosmopolitanism" is a means of destroying the struggle of people for freedom and independence and achieving the hegemony of monopoly capital. These great gentlemen closely combine the promotion of "cosmopolitanism" with beastly blind patriotism, closely linking it with their worst forms and practical application of support for racial theory. Like blind patriotism and the oppression of any nation, "cosmopolitanism" is mutually exclusive and hostile to Soviet ideology. The Soviet social and state system and the Leninist-Stalinist national policy have promoted tremendous progress in the economy and culture of all nationalities formerly oppressed by the Tsarist system, resulting in the flourishing of the culture of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, a culture that is socialist in content and national in form.

The determination to put communist ideas into practice is inextricably linked with Soviet patriotism, which is an inexhaustible source of inspiration for the Soviet people and for Soviet writers and artists, whose creations reveal in artistic images the inner meaning of the labor and affairs of the people of the Soviet era. Most of the literary works that won the Stalin Prize in 1948 have advanced Soviet figures as their central characters. The following works are all set in the 1940s—the communist century—with Soviet figures as the protagonists: Vasily Azhayev's novel "Far from Moscow," Vsevolod Babaev's "Steel and Slag," Semyon Babayevsky's "Gold Star," Anna Sakse's "Upward," Tyazhirbei Sindiabekov's "Our People Today," Ilyshalei Matseyev's "From the Bottom of My Heart," short stories by Georgy Gulia and Yury Laptev, poetry by Nikolai Tikhonov, Mikhail Isakovsky, Nikolai Gribachev, and Mummy Leichen, dramas by Anatoly Sofronov, Alexander Korneichuk, and Anatoly Surov, and the films "The Young Guard," "The Court of Honor," and "A Story of a Real Man," as well as paintings and sculptures.

The poems that won the Stalin Prize include Simonov's "Friends and Enemies," Mykola Bazhan's "Impressions of England," and the drama is Nikolai Virta's "Conspiracy of the Doomed," whose themes are multifaceted: the friends and enemies of socialism and peace and democracy. These highly artistic works prove the superiority of socialism over capitalism. Their strength lies in their profound truth and lofty Bolshevik ideas. The strength of the entire Soviet socialist culture, the strength of all Soviet literature and art, lies there. In contrast, all that is manifested in the imperialist camp is ideological regression and decline. The only thing that bourgeois culture can contribute to humanity today is to promote suicidal wars and empty, slavish existence and death.

The awarding of the Stalin Prize not only proves the existing strength of Soviet culture, but also proves its potential and abundant strength. This culture is the culture of tomorrow—communism—which is eagerly awaited by all progressive humanity.

    欣欣向荣的苏联文化

    斯大林奖金是苏联每年用来奖励杰出的科学上的成就、研究和发明、生产方式的基本改良以及文学艺术的卓越创作。它最初设立在一九三九年为了纪念进步科学的导师和共产党以及苏联人民的领袖约瑟夫、斯大林之六十诞辰。斯大林奖金的颁发已成为一个传统性的，对苏维埃社会主义文化的成就和收获作一总检阅的机会。经过这样一番审阅后，在四月九日和十日公布了苏联政府对科学家、作家、艺术家、发明者和改良生产者为他们在一九四八年的工作成就而颁给斯大林奖金的决定。仅就新斯大林奖金获得者的一张名单和政府公告中衔头以及关于因杰出成就而获奖的极简短的记载，就是社会主义文化进步的显著证明。
    一九四八年，每一科学和技术部门所做的卓著发现、研究、发明和改良的事实，令人不得不为之惊奇，那一年在散文、诗、戏剧、电影、音乐、绘画、雕刻和建筑方面，都出现了誉满全国的一等作品，在资本主义制度下，尤其在目前帝国主义阶段，束缚和扼杀科学和艺术，摧残并毁害蕴藏于人民中才能的镣铐，已被社会主义社会和国家制度所粉碎。在苏联的各知识部门，每年都带来了许多新增加的重要科学发现和研究：物理、数学、技术、化学、生物、农业、医药、经济、法律、历史和语言学。其中有些成就在他们特殊的领域里是划时代的。
    尤其在一九四八年，卓越的创造产生于极不相同的知识部门里——从浮诺夫的研究宇宙线和拉迪捷夫的研究电子核物理学，到卢白柯夫对古俄罗斯的基本研究和托尔斯托夫对古代库连兹姆的历史和考古的探寻；从以驰名世界的科学家李森科为代表的并完成了先进米邱林生物学的主要研究之农业生物学，到万尼狄克托夫教授把国家社会主义财产作为一个法学的范畴来研究。特别要提到的是技术科学中的某些成就，例如卡迪玛夫和巴柏夫的创造，在它们各个部门中，展开了科学的新的一页。在金属加热和机器及器具上弹性部份的选择方面，以分析和证明的科学计算法，替代过去沿用的以经验为主的方法。
    苏联第一流科学家的全部创造的显著特征是在科学上敢于提出新问题，同时又和实践及国家人民的重大需要保持密切的联系。十一年前斯大林举杯祝贺那“不是超然于人民，脱离人民，而是准备为人民服务”的科学，这就是苏联社会主义的科学，这就是它和资本主义国家的科学之基本区别，在资本主义国家中，科学被降到统治阶级的佣仆地位，是反对人民和压迫人民的。
    数十名优秀的苏联科学家，如学院会员巴丁、来比得夫和南米沃金，已经以卓越的发明和生产方式的基本改良，而获得一九四八年的斯大林奖金。和他们同列在得奖名单上的几百名设计家、工厂指导员、工程师和技师，他们都是全国闻名的，在工业、运输和农业方面，以进步科学之事实为基础的卓越进步的新的生产方法的发明者和提倡者。在斯大林奖金获得者中有为数不少的产业工人：一绒织厂的助理领班亚力山大·赤金克，一电灯厂的一个女突击队员凡仑丁娜·克列撒诺娃，机车驾驶员伊凡梭罗凡沃夫，磨坊机器工人西门诺夫斯基和却别谢夫，旋盘工人波盖维契、毕柯夫和但尼索夫——以及很多别的工人。
    历史证明，正如斯大林所说：“有时候照耀科学和技术的新道路的不是众所周知的科学家，而是科学界里默默无闻的人们，平凡和实干的人们，在它们部门里的改良者”。
    在苏联社会这种改良已成为平凡而惯常之事，一个工人因科学成就而获得政府奖金，这在任何资本主义都是不可能的；然而在苏联却很平常，那里每个人的劳动——工人或集体农庄农民，男子或妇女——都是为了人民利益，愉快而有创造性地工作，那里改良的迫切要求统治着数百万人的思想和行动。
    如同在先前的阶级社会一样，在资本主义制度下体力劳动和精神劳动之间横着不能通过的鸿沟。这鸿沟在社会主义社会是不存在的。在我们现在正向着过渡中的共产主义第二阶段精神劳动和体力劳动的分界是会坚决消灭的。这可以由千百个例子来说明，斯大林奖金的名单就是其中之一：普通工人和集体农庄农民的名字和驰名世界的学院会员的名字并列于名单上。
    获奖的卓越科学创作、发明、改良、文学和艺术作品等，并非来自国内一二个大文化中心，而是来自苏维埃联邦共和国十六个组成共和国中许多不同的城镇和村庄。苏联的文化成就是俄罗斯人、乌克兰人、白俄罗斯人、乔其亚人、乌兹别克人、亚受培强人、亚美尼亚人、爱斯东尼亚人、拉脱维亚人、立陶宛人和所有在社会主义太阳下繁荣的其他民族的文化成就。
    美帝国主义的仆从们孜孜不倦地宣传科学、文学和艺术的“世界主义”，由于他们发现“世界主义”是摧毁为自由独立的人民斗争和达成独占资本雄霸世界的手段，这些大人先生们把“世界主义”的宣传和兽性的盲目爱国主义紧密结合，把它和以它们最恶劣的方式和它们实际应用上对种族论的支持密切联系起来，如同盲目的爱国主义和对任何民族的压迫一样，“世界主义”和苏维埃的思想意识是相排斥，相敌对的。苏联社会和国家制度以及列宁斯大林的民族政策，已经在过去被沙皇制度压迫的各民族中，促成了经济和文化的巨大进步，结果使苏联各民族的文化兴盛起来，这文化是社会主义内容和民族形式的文化。
    把共产主义思想贯彻到实践中的决心是和苏联的爱国心密不可分地结合着，这爱国心是苏联人民取之不尽的灵感源泉，是苏联作家和艺术家的灵感源泉，他们的创作以艺术的形象揭示了苏维埃时代人民劳动和事物的内在意义，得一九四八年斯大林奖金的文学作品，大多以先进的苏维埃人物为中心人物。下列作品都是二十世纪四十年代——共产主义世纪——以苏维埃人物为主角的：瓦西里·阿然耶夫的长篇小说“远离莫斯科”，弗烈特马·巴柏夫的“钢和铁滓”，西米因·巴巴也夫斯基的“金星奖”，安娜·萨克西斯的“上升”，特及尔培，辛狄贝柯夫的“我们今天的人民”，伊利沙来·马特赛夫的“心底”，乔及·葛略和犹烈·拉普特耶夫的短篇小说，尼古拉·铁考诺夫，米海尔·伊萨柯夫斯基，尼古拉·葛立巴遮夫和孟密·雷勤的诗歌，安那泰列·梭弗罗诺夫，亚力山大·库奈契克和安那泰列·梭罗夫的戏剧，电影“青年近卫军”、“名誉裁判所”和“一个真人的故事”，尚有绘画和雕刻等。
    得斯大林奖金的诗歌有西蒙诺夫的“友与敌”，米考莱·巴扎汉的“英国印象”，戏剧是尼古拉·万达的“命定者的阴谋”，其题材一多方面的一是社会主义的友人和敌人以及和平与民主，这些高度艺术性的作品证明了社会主义之优于资本主义，它们的力量在于深刻的真理和崇高的布尔什维克思想，全苏维埃社会主义文化的力量，全苏维埃文学和艺术的力量都在于那里，和这相对照的，帝国主义阵营所表现的一切是思想意识的倒退和没落。如今资产阶级文化所唯一能贡献给人类的是宣传自杀性的战争和空洞的奴隶般的生存和死亡。
    斯大林奖金的颁给不但证明了苏维埃文化的现有力量，更证明了它的潜在的雄厚力量，这文化就是为全进步人类所热烈期待的明天——共产主义之文化。
