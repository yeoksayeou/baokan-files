　　Defending Factories and Mines
　　Chahar Provincial Government and Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua Cities Study Methods
　　[Zhangjiakou News] On the 14th, the Chahar Provincial People's Government convened responsible persons from state-owned industrial, mining, transportation, and trade units in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua to study how to strengthen security work. The meeting reviewed that in the past few months, due to the neglect and麻痹 of security work by many managers of factories and mines and local governments, some unnecessary losses had been incurred. Taking the Longyan Iron Mine as an example, the equipment of the Pangjiabao Mining Office of the mine has been continuously damaged. The six 77,000-volt high-voltage transmission lines within 20 kilometers of the area were largely intact in February of this year. According to a survey conducted by personnel dispatched by the Chahar Central Branch of the North China Electric Power Company on the 11th of this month, about half of them have been stolen. However, the Xuanhua Longguan County governments and the Xuanhua Municipal Government have taken a laissez-faire attitude towards those who illegally steal and sell mining equipment, failing to actively find ways to stop them, and have not strictly implemented the orders of the Military Control Commission. In addition, the power lines between Yanggao and Datong on the Ping绥 Railway have been damaged several times, and many problems have also occurred in the protection of property and materials. Due to麻痹 and carelessness on the part of the leadership, about one million catties of grain in the Yanggao granary were soaked in rainwater and became moldy. Regarding how to strengthen security work, the meeting decided that, first, cadres, workers, and the masses should be educated to recognize the importance of protecting state property, and county heads of Longxuan County Committee should convene meetings to implement joint defense in various villages; second, mass security and inspection work should be strengthened, and fire and flood prevention equipment should be actively improved; third, mine police, factory police, or worker pickets should be organized, and military police should be stationed in important mines for guard duty as appropriate, and local governments should mobilize the masses to implement armed patrols; fourth, the railway, public security, and taxation departments should be notified to conduct strict inspections of profiteers who steal and sell goods near mines and along the Ping绥 Railway; for saboteurs, appropriate punishments should be imposed, and for bandits and special agents who carry out organized and planned sabotage, the most severe suppression should be carried out. Chairman Zhang Su of the Provincial Government severely criticized the erroneous view held by a small number of government workers in Xuanhua, Longguan, and other counties that "the masses live a hard life, and stealing some steel to exchange for food is nothing." He pointed out that the destruction of mines by lawbreakers must be dealt with.

　　保卫厂矿
  　察省府与张宣两市研究办法
    【张家口讯】十四日，察哈尔省人民政府召集张家口、宣化两市公营工、矿、交通、贸易等单位负责人，研究如何加强保卫工作问题。会议检讨出在过去数月中，由于不少工厂、矿山管理人员及当地政府对于保卫工作的漠视、麻痹，曾招致了一些不应有的损失。以龙烟铁矿为例，该矿庞家堡采矿所各项设备，至今仍不断遭受破坏，该地二十公里之七万七千伏特高压输电线六条，本年二月尚大体完整，本月十一日据华北电业公司察中分公司派人勘测结果，已约一半被盗走，而当地之宣化龙关两县政府及宣化市政府，对于违法盗卖矿山器材者，采取放任自流态度，未能积极的设法制止，更未严格执行军管会命令。又如平绥路阳高至大同间电线已数次遭受破坏，在财产、物资保护工作上亦发生不少问题。阳高粮库由于领导上的麻痹、大意，约有百万斤食粮被雨水浸入而致发霉。关于如何加强保卫工作问题，会议决定，第一，教育干部、工人、群众，使之认识保护国家财产的重要性，由龙宣县委县长开会实行各村联防；第二，加强群众性的保卫工作和检查工作，积极改进防火防水设备；第三，组织矿警、厂警或工人纠察队，重要矿山酌情派遣军警驻扎戒备，并由当地政府发动群众实行武装巡逻；第四，通知铁路、公安、税务各部门在矿场附近及平绥路沿线严密检查盗卖之奸商；对于破坏分子，酌情处分，对于有组织有计划破坏之匪特，予以最严厉之镇压。省府张苏主席特别严厉的批评了宣化、龙关等县少数政权工作人员所抱的“群众生活苦、偷点钢铁换食粮不算什么”的错误观点，指出：不法分子对于矿山的破坏，必须予以处理。
