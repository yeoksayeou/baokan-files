    Significant Increase in Depositors in Early July
    Improved Lump-Sum Deposit Method Welcomed by Workers
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the People's Bank of Beiping Branch's Savings Department launched its savings business in conjunction with the conservation movement, it has achieved initial results. Responding to the North China People's Government's call for conservation, the bank began promotional mobilization work in various public and private factories on June 21st. The work has been valued and coordinated by the trade unions in more than 20 units, including the People's Printing Factory, North China Cement Company, North China Electric Power Company, Postal Administration, and private Chuqi Paper Mill. The first batch from the People's Printing Factory included 195 workers opening accounts, and the Chuqi Paper Mill also introduced 15 workers to open accounts for the first time. The number of new accounts opened in the first ten days of July by the Savings Department, Second Business Office, and various agencies has increased. A total of 1,783 accounts were opened in ten days, a significant increase compared to the 1,196 accounts in late June.
    [Another report] Since the implementation of the new real value savings regulations on July 1st, the "lump-sum deposit" method has been well received by workers due to improvements in the regulations, resulting in an increase in the number of these deposit accounts. Among the more than 1,700 accounts opened in the first ten days of July, 979 were "lump-sum deposit" accounts. Previously, "lump-sum deposit" accounts had always been the most popular, but in this period, "lump-sum deposit" accounts have taken the lead. According to statistics on the occupations of account holders, there have also been changes in the first ten days of July, with an increase in worker accounts, accounting for over 30% of all accounts.
