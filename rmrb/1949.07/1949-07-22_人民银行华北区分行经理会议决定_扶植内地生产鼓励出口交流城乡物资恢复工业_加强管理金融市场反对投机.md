The People's Bank of China North China District Branch Manager Meeting Decides to
	Support Inland Production, Encourage Exports, Exchange Urban and Rural Materials, Restore Industry
	Strengthen Management of Financial Markets, and Oppose Speculation
	[This Newspaper's Report] The People's Bank of China North China District Branch Manager Meeting opened on the 2nd of this month and concluded successfully on the 13th, lasting ten days. The meeting summarized the work of the first half of the year and discussed in detail the work tasks and specific plans for the second half of the year.
	The meeting pointed out that the situation in the North China region has undergone tremendous changes in the first half of 1949. All remaining enemy strongholds have been cleared, transportation has gradually recovered, and man-made blockades have been eliminated. The central task of the entire region has shifted from war to production. During this period, the People's Bank of China first adopted measures such as stopping loans and offering physical asset-backed deposits to tighten currency, actively cooperate in stabilizing prices, and support the Tianjin front line. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, it immediately engaged in intense takeover work, eliminated the puppet gold yuan notes in a short period of time, basically eliminated the silver dollar market, established a unified local currency market, took over the puppet government's national banks, bureaus, and treasuries, established a new financial system, offered real value savings to absorb scattered funds, and helped stabilize the real income of salaried workers. It offered order-based, real value, and in-kind loans to solve the production difficulties of public and private manufacturers; established foreign exchange management and operations to assist in the development of foreign trade; handled the registration and capital verification of private silver shops according to management methods, supervised and helped gold shops to change their business, handled bill exchanges, opened securities transactions to channel and manage idle funds, and used various methods to organize training classes and on-the-job learning to transform new cadres. In rural areas, spring plowing loans were carried out, and in-kind loan work was promoted. During this period, the detrimental legacy of the enemy and puppet financial markets was basically eliminated, a new financial order and market were established, and preliminary close ties were established on the basis of production. The work in the first half of the year was successful.
	The meeting pointed out that the second half of the year will be in a situation of national victory. In terms of production, it is the harvest season. In the North China region, on the one hand, it is the task of restoring industrial and agricultural production, and on the other hand, it is the general task of supporting the war in Jiangnan. We must organize the restoration of industrial production, especially civilian light industry, so as to provide more industrial products needed for production and life in the vast rural market, in exchange for farmers' grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods. At the same time, only when farmers' purchasing power is improved and their living standards are improved can a vast domestic market be opened up, preparing excellent conditions for the restoration of industrial production. Therefore, the main task of the North China region bank in the second half of the year can be summarized as: Through agricultural loans and other loans and acceptances, link the work of supporting production in the inland areas with the work of supporting exports in Tianjin, so as to vigorously stimulate inland production and encourage exports; through the development of domestic remittances and industrial loans, promote the exchange of urban and rural materials and help restore industrial production. The meeting stipulated that the main tasks for the second half of the year are as follows:
	(1) To handle industrial loans and, under necessary and possible conditions, help restore the production of all public and private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood.
	(2) After this year's autumn harvest, cooperate with trade cooperation departments to purchase crops such as cotton and peanuts to protect the interests of farmers; organize winter sideline production to lay the foundation for next year's production, and help people in disaster areas to produce and overcome famine. These tasks are mainly achieved through organizing the export of export goods, and in these activities, establish and develop supply and marketing cooperatives.
	(3) The entire bank will vigorously support exports. In this favorable winter season, help organize various specialized cooperatives, help legitimate export and transit merchants, and link the banks in the origin of various export goods with the Tianjin Branch and the Bank of China to handle loans, remittances, and inland acceptances to facilitate the organization of exports and control foreign exchange.
	(4) Continue to pilot and, according to conditions, promote savings business in large cities and industrial and mining areas, and strengthen various deposit-taking activities to accumulate more strength to support production.
	(5) Strengthen the management of financial markets. The bank should closely cooperate with trade and industry departments to oppose all speculative activities in the market, encourage and help the business activities of private silver shops to turn to supporting production, strictly prohibit the black market activities of gold and silver, and gradually increase the nature of the securities market as a normal production activity.
	The meeting pointed out that in order to complete the above-mentioned main tasks, it is necessary to strengthen the investigation and statistics of industrial production, overcome rural disorganization and handicraft style, implement necessary and possible centralization and unification, and closely cooperate with state-owned economic departments. The meeting called on all comrades of the bank to strengthen their learning, learn what we do not know, and strive for the construction of a new democratic economy.

    会议指出华北区形势在一九四九年的前半年有极大变化，所有敌人残余据点都肃清了，交通逐渐恢复了，人为封锁消除了，全区的中心任务已从战争转入生产。中国人民银行在此期间先是采取停止放款，举办实物保本存款等措施以紧缩通货，积极配合稳定物价，支援平津前线；平津解放后即投入紧张的接管工作，在短期内肃清了伪金圆券；基本上扫除了银元市场，建立了一元化的本币市场，接收伪政府的国家银行、局、库，建立了新的金融体系，举办折实储蓄，吸收零散资金，帮助稳定薪资阶层的实际收入；举办定货、折实、贷实等放款，以解决公私营厂商生产困难；建立外汇的管理和经营，以协助对外贸易的开展；根据管理办法办理私营银钱业的登记验资和督导帮助金店转业，办理票据交换，开放证券交易以疏导管理游资，并用各种方式组织训练班和在职学习以改造新干部。在农村则进行了春耕贷款，推行了贷实工作。在此期间，基本上扫除了敌伪金融市场的恶劣遗迹，建立了新的金融秩序和市场，初步在生产基础上密切联系起来了，上半年的工作是有成绩的。
    会议指出下半年将处在全国胜利的情况，在生产上说是收获季节，在华北区一方面是恢复工农业生产，一方面是支援江南战争的总任务下，我们必须组织恢复工业生产，特别是民用轻工业，以便能提供更多为广大农村市场生产与生活所需的工业品，以换取农民的粮食、工业原料、出口物资，同时也只有农民的购买力提高了，生活水平改善了，才能开辟广大的国内市场，为恢复工业生产准备优良的条件，因此华北区银行下半年的主要工作任务概括起来说就是：通过农贷及其他贷款押汇，把内地扶植生产工作和天津扶植出口的工作联系起来，以有力地刺激内地生产，鼓励出口；通过内汇和工贷的开展，促进城乡物资交流，帮助工业生产的恢复，会议规定下半年的主要工作有下列各项：
    （一）办理工业贷款，在必要和可能条件下帮助一切有益国计民生的公私营企业生产的恢复。
    （二）今年秋收后配合贸易合作部门收购棉花、花生等作物以维护农民利益；组织冬季副业生产为明年生产打下基础，并帮助灾区人民生产渡荒。这些工作主要都通过组织出口物资出口的方法来实现，并在这些活动中建立和发展供销合作社。
    （三）全行大力扶植出口，在今冬有利季节中，帮助组织各种专业合作社，帮助正当的出口及转运商人，各出口物资产地银行和天津分行、中国银行联系起来办理放款汇兑、内地押汇，以便利组织出口，掌握外汇。
    （四）继续试办和根据条件，在大城市工矿区推广储蓄业务，加强各种吸收存款活动，以积聚更多的力量，扶植生产。
    （五）加强金融市场的管理，银行要和贸易工商部门密切配合以反对市场上一切投机活动，鼓励和帮助私营银钱业的业务活动转向扶植生产，严禁金银黑市活动，使证券市场逐渐增大其作为正常生产活动的性质。
    会议指出，为了完成上述主要任务，必须加强对工业生产的调查统计，必须克服农村散漫和手工业作风，必须实行必要的和可能的集中统一，必须和国营经济部门紧密合作。会议号召全行同志，必须加强学习，要学会我们所不会的东西，为建设新民主主义经济而努力。
