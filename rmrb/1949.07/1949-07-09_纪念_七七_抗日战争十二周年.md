　　Commemorating the Twelfth Anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War
    Ma Xulun
    After eight years of arduous struggle, we achieved a great victory in the Anti-Japanese War, and then spent three years defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries who were fully supported by American imperialism. As national liberation is about to be realized, and a new Political Consultative Conference is about to be convened to establish a democratic coalition government, working together to build a new people's democratic China, commemorating "July 7th" feels even more meaningful.

    We are now in a new era of unparalleled greatness in Chinese history. Workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie across the country have united, along with the invincible People's Liberation Army, and led by a disciplined Communist Party with Marxist-Leninist theory, causing the Kuomintang reactionary army to suffer an unprecedented collapse, leaving the imperialists helpless.

    But twelve years ago, the situation was completely different. Since the "September 18th Incident," Japanese imperialism had annexed the Northeast, controlled North China, and was poised to destroy all of China. The Kuomintang adopted the reactionary policy of "internal pacification before external resistance," seeking humiliation and peace abroad, refusing to resist, and internally suppressing the people's anti-Japanese and national salvation movement, repeatedly carrying out "encirclement and suppression" campaigns, vainly attempting to realize its dream of unifying the world.

    At the same time, the Kuomintang's traitorous policies further emboldened Japanese imperialism. On "July 7th," they massed troops on the border and launched a nationwide invasion. At that time, Japan had a world-renowned army and was aided by British and American imperialism. The Kuomintang had no intention of resisting at all, and therefore made no preparations. At the beginning of the war, the reactionaries adopted a death-grip defense policy in Shanghai, waiting to be beaten, and then adopted a policy of escape, fleeing without a fight, allowing the Japanese invaders to drive straight in, all the way to Guizhou. At the same time, many bureaucratic leaders of the reactionaries openly became traitors, and a large number of troops became puppet troops, surrendering to the Japanese invaders and turning around to kill the people. Even the Japanese invaders admitted that the "anti-Japanese camp" of Chiang Kai-shek and the "peace camp" of Wang Jingwei "can only be distinguished on the map and in appearance, but its content... is difficult to clearly divide" (see the Japanese magazine China, May 1944). Because the fundamental purpose of the reactionaries was not to resist Japan, but to oppose the people and oppose the Communist Party. On the one hand, it sabotaged the people's unity and anti-Japanese forces in the KMT-controlled areas, and on the other hand, it used heavy troops in coordination with the enemy to attack the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army.

    However, the people of the whole country insisted on resisting Japan. Before "July 7th," in Peiping, North China, Shanghai and other places, there were various anti-Japanese and national salvation movements by students and cultural circles. Although they were oppressed and ravaged by the Kuomintang reactionaries, they persisted in various ways and went deep into the people. Since 1931, when Japan invaded Northeast China in the "September 18th Incident," the CCP has led the people of Northeast China to jointly resist Japan, organizing guerrillas everywhere and forming the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army. In order to unite the forces of resistance against Japan, the Communist Party of China repeatedly called on "all those who do not want to be slaves to unite and fight against Japan together under the anti-imperialist united front."

    After the Red Army led by the Communist Party of China went north to resist Japan, it persuaded the Northeast Army and Northwest Army in Shaanxi to jointly resist Japan. In the Xi'an Incident in 1936, after Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng detained Chiang Kai-shek, the Communist Party of China cooperated with Zhang and Yang in releasing Chiang Kai-shek on the condition that Chiang Kai-shek admitted to implementing resistance against Japan. This promoted the Anti-Japanese War of July 7, 1937. After July 7, the Communist Party of China, in practice, led the people to establish anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines, smashed countless joint sweeps by the enemy, and constantly defeated the enemy, expanding the liberated areas. The famous Pingxingguan Victory, the Hundred Regiments Offensive, and subsequent anti-sweeping operations in various places made the enemy's difficulties more and more serious. In theory, Chairman Mao of the CCP wrote two major works, "On Protracted War" and "On New Democracy," which correctly analyzed the military and political situation of the Anti-Japanese War, and pointed out a bright future to the people of the whole country in times of difficulty. No wonder the enemy and puppets had to admit that the main force of the Anti-Japanese War was the Communist Party of China.

    In the eight years of arduous resistance, the Communist Party created a great People's Liberation Army like steel, invincible, unconquerable, and with very strict discipline. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of the whole country were united, and finally won a great final victory, laying the foundation for the victory of the subsequent three-year Liberation War.

    After the Japanese surrendered, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries openly colluded with the enemy and puppets, wanting to monopolize the fruits of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. At the same time, they used the support of American imperialism to launch an anti-Communist and anti-people civil war. However, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, after winning the great victory in the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, have been united and can exert great power to suppress the reactionaries. The three-year Liberation War not only proved the greatness of the Communist Party and the people's strength, but also made the People's Liberation Army even stronger, and the people of the whole country more united, opening up a new era of national liberation and victory.

    Also, the socialist Soviet Union, after the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, when Western imperialism was still helping Japan, and when China was facing an unprecedented national crisis, regardless of the Kuomintang reactionary government's consistent anti-Soviet attitude, resolutely signed a non-aggression treaty with China and gave China comprehensive assistance. Even Soong Mei-ling, one of the leaders of the Kuomintang reactionaries, could not but admit at the end of 1940 that "the assistance China has received from the Soviet Union in the three years of the Anti-Japanese War is actually several times more than the total of Britain and the United States." After the Soviet Union defeated Hitler, it turned around and declared war on Japan. The Red Army, with a million troops, entered the Northeast in four routes by land, sea, and air, making rapid progress, making the most elite Kwantung Army of the Japanese invaders completely lose its ability to resist, greatly shortening the war against Japan, and making China's resistance to Japan win early.

    The eight-year Anti-Japanese War has given us a valuable experience. That is: the Communist Party of China is the leader, organizer and promoter of the great Anti-Japanese War. At the same time, the victory of China's resistance to Japan is inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of the whole country would not be able to unite, and the resistance to Japan would definitely fail; without the international assistance of the Soviet Union, China's resistance to Japan would be prolonged and the struggle would be more arduous.

    We relied on the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the international assistance of the Soviet Union to win the great victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Now, to commemorate the twelfth anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, which has great historical significance, we must use this valuable experience to consolidate our victory. That is to say: the people of the whole country must unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Communist Party of China, and cooperate closely with the international democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union, to accelerate national liberation and build a great, glorious and splendid new China, forever eliminate the reactionaries, and never be ravaged by imperialism again.

    Now that Japanese imperialism has surrendered for four years, the peace treaty with Japan is still far away. China is the country that resisted Japan for the longest time and made the greatest sacrifices, but after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, American imperialism went its own way, occupying Japan alone, maintaining the reactionary forces in Japan and oppressing the Japanese people, attempting to make Japan a dependency of the United States and a pioneer for American imperialism's aggression in the Far East. Recently, it unilaterally decided to stop Japan's reparations, disregarding the United Nations, which jointly participated in the war against Japan. This not only completely violates the Potsdam Agreement, but also violates the will of the Chinese and Japanese people. Now the Japanese people are being suppressed by American imperialism and cannot resist, but the people of the whole country will never allow American imperialism to act arbitrarily. We firmly advocate that the meeting of the five foreign ministers must strictly follow the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, to discuss the peace treaty with Japan. The democratic coalition government produced by the New Political Consultative Conference of China must send representatives to jointly participate in the meeting and prepare the procedures to abolish the old militarism of Japan, so that the Japanese people can unite and build a peaceful and democratic new Japan. Then China and Japan will be able to cooperate economically and culturally to promote the emergence of a peaceful and democratic new world.

### 纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年

　　纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年
    马叙伦
    经过了八年艰苦斗争，我们获得了抗日战争伟大胜利，接着又费了三年工夫把美国帝国主义所全力支持的国民党反动派打垮了。在这全国解放即将实现，并即将召开新政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府，共同努力建设人民民主新中国的时候，来纪念“七七”，更觉得有深长的意义。
    我们现在是处在一个中国有史以来伟大无比的新时代，全国工人农民小资产阶级与民族资产阶级，已经团结起来，有所向无敌的人民解放军，并且有一个有纪律的有马克思列宁主义理论的共产党领导着，使国民党反动派军队遭到空前大崩溃，使帝国主义束手无策。
    但是在十二年以前，情形就完全不同了。日本帝国主义自从“九一八”以后，即并吞了东北，控制了华北，眼看着要来灭亡全中国了。而国民党则采取了“攘外必先安内”的反动政策，对外屈辱求和决不抵抗，对内尽力镇压民众的抗日救亡运动，数次进行“剿共”，妄图实现其一统天下的幻梦。
    同时国民党的卖国政策，更使日本帝国主义气焰万丈，到了“七七”，即大兵压境，开展了全国性的侵略，当时日本有全世闻名的军队，而且还得到英美帝国主义的援助。而国民党则根本没有抗战的意思，所以毫无准备。在抗战开始的时候，反动派在上海采取死守主义，等着挨打，以后就采取逃跑主义，不战而逃，使日寇得以长驱直入，一直打到了贵州。同时反动派有许多官僚头子，公开做了汉奸，大批军队做了伪军，向日寇投降，回头来杀害人民。甚至日寇也承认蒋介石的“抗日阵营”与汪精卫的“和平阵营”“只能在地图上和外表上来区分，至于它的内容……难于截然划分”（见一九四四年五月日寇支那杂志）。因为反动派的根本目的不是抗日，而是反对人民反对共产党。它一面在蒋管区内破坏人民团结，破坏抗战力量，一面则用重兵与敌人配合，进攻新四军与八路军。
    但是全国人民是坚持抗日的。“七七”以前，在北平、华北、上海等地，就有学生与文化界的各种抗日救国运动，虽遭国民党反动派的压迫摧残，仍用各种方式，坚持下去，而且深入民众。从一九三一年“九一八”日本侵入东北的时候起，中共就领导东北人民共同抗日，到处组织游击队，并组成了东北抗日联军。为了团结抗日的力量，中国共产党屡次号召“一切不愿做亡国奴的人们联合起来，在反帝统一战线之下，一致对日作战”。
    中国共产党所领导的红军北上抗日以后，说服了陕西的东北军西北军共同抗日，而在一九三六年双一二事变中张学良杨虎城两将军扣留了蒋介石以后，中国共产党又协同张、杨在蒋介石承认实行抗日的条件下释放了蒋介石，这样才促成了一九三七年七七的抗战，七七以后，中国共产党在实践方面，领导民众建立敌后解放区，粉碎了敌人无数次的联合扫荡，并不断杀退敌人，扩大了各解放区。著名的平型关大捷，百团大战，及以后各地的反扫荡，使敌人的困难愈来愈大。而在理论方面，中共毛主席著了“论持久战”和“新民主主义论”两大著作，正确地分析了抗日战争的军事形势和政治形势，向全国人民在困难中指出光明的前途。无怪敌伪也不得不承认，抗日的主力是中国共产党。
    在八年的坚苦抗战中，共产党造成了一支战无不胜攻无不取而且纪律非常严明的钢铁样的伟大人民解放军，全国人民在共产党领导之下，已团结在一起，终于获得了伟大的最后胜利，并奠定了以后三年解放战争胜利的基础。
    当日寇投降以后，蒋介石反动派即公开与敌伪合流，想独吞抗战胜利的果实，同时利用美国帝国主义支持，开展了反中国共产党反人民的内战。但是经过八年抗战获得伟大胜利以后的中国共产党与中国人民已经团结一致，能够发挥伟大的力量，来镇压反动派了。这三年的解放战争，不独证明了共产党与人民力量的伟大，而且人民解放军因此更加强大，全国人民更加团结，开展了全国解放胜利的新时代。
    还有社会主义的苏联，在“七七”抗战以后，当西方帝国主义还在帮助日本，当中国遭到空前民族危机的时候，不管国民党反动政府的一贯反苏态度，即毅然与中国签订了互不侵犯条约，并给中国以全面的援助。连国民党反动派的首领之一宋美龄，在一九四○年底也不能不承认“中国抗战三年来，从苏联所得的援助，实在比英美的总和还多好几倍。”等苏联打垮希特勒以后，回头来对日本宣战，红军以百万大军，由海陆空分四路攻入东北，进展神速，使日寇最精锐的关东军，也完全失去抵抗能力，使对日战争，大大缩短，使中国抗战，提早胜利。
    八年的抗战，使我们获得了一个宝贵的经验。就是：中国共产党是伟大抗日战争的领导者组织者与推动者。同时中国抗战的胜利，和苏联的援助是分不开的，没有共产党的领导，全国人民无从团结，抗战一定失败；没有苏联的国际援助，中国抗战必更延长，而且奋斗更为坚苦。
    我们依靠了中国共产党的正确领导，苏联的国际援助，获得了抗日的伟大胜利。现在为纪念具有伟大历史意义的“七七”抗战十二周年，我们更要利用这个宝贵的经验，来巩固我们的胜利。这就是说：我们全国人民更要在中国共产党毛主席领导之下团结一致，并与以苏联为首的国际民主势力密切合作，来努力加速全国解放，来建设一个伟大的光辉灿烂的新中国，永远消灭反动派，永远不再受帝国主义的蹂躏。
    现在日本帝国主义投降已有四年，而对日和约还是遥遥无期。中国是抵抗日本最久牺牲最大的国家，但是抗战胜利以后，美帝国主义即一意孤行，独自占领日本，维持日本的反动势力压迫日本人民，企图以日本为美国之附庸，作美国帝国主义侵略远东的先锋。近来又擅自决定停止日本的赔偿，置共同参加对日作战的联合国而不顾。这不独完全违反波茨坦协定，而且违背中日两国人民的意志。现在日本人民为美国帝国主义镇压者，无法反抗，但是中国全国人民是决不允许美国帝国主义独断孤行的。我们坚决主张必须严格的依照波茨坦协定所规定的，由五国外长会议，开会商议对日和约，会议中必须由中国新政治协商会议所产生的民主联合政府派遣代表，共同参加，准备程序，来取消日本旧的军国主义，使日本人民能一致起来，建设和平民主的新日本，则中日两国必能在经济上与文化上共同合作，来促进和平民主的新世界的出现。
