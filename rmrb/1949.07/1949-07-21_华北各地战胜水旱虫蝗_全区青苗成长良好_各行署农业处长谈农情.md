　　North China Overcomes Drought, Flood, Insect and Locust Plagues
  　Crops Grow Well Throughout the Region
    Agricultural Directors of Each Administrative Office Talk About Agricultural Conditions
    [Reported by This Newspaper] "How are the crops growing in North China?" With this question, our reporter visited the agricultural directors of each administrative office who came to Beijing to attend the North China Agricultural Production Conference. Their replies are as follows:
    In the Hebei-Central area this year, most of the cotton was planted by dibbling. Cotton seedlings in general areas are more than half a foot tall, and in good areas like the Fourth District, they are more than a foot tall. Peanuts planted by dibbling have all formed pods and are flowering, and the situation is very good. The millet, corn, sorghum, and late-season crops sown in irrigated areas before May 21st, and the late crops sown after the wheat harvest, are all growing well. If there are no more floods or insect plagues in the future, the harvest this year may be good. Locust nymphs occurred in some areas of eastern Hebei, but the losses were minor due to timely capture and beating. Cotton aphids also did not cause a disaster due to emergency prevention and control by the leadership and a recent heavy rain. The cotton is already more than half a foot tall, and corn, sorghum, peanuts, etc. are all growing very well. Generally, the seedlings have been hoed twice, and some have been hoed three times. This year, the fruit trees in the area suffered more from insect pests. Drought, insect, and hail disasters have not caused major losses to the seedlings. The recent heavy rain has greatly helped the growth of the crops. If the rainfall is even in the future and there are no major floods or insect pests, it is estimated that there may be an eight or nine-tenths yield. In the Taihang area, the seedlings had been hoed twice by the beginning of July. The growth of the seedlings is best in the Third District, followed by the Fourth and Fifth Districts. The leadership closely integrated with the masses, actively exterminated locusts, and saved more than 1.4 million mu of seedlings. The area has many mountains and often suffers from drought. Water conservancy is one of the important factors determining agricultural production. In order to consolidate the achievements already made in spring plowing, it is necessary to pay attention to fighting drought and protecting seedlings. The administrative office is still stepping up water conservancy projects. It is budgeted to use more than 2 million catties of grain to carry out this work. The administrative office also sent people to northern Henan in June to establish a water conservancy bureau and form a water conservancy work team to inspect river defenses and survey water conservancy in various places. In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, serious insect plagues occurred in 51 counties. The most harmful were grubworms, which ate a lot of spring seedlings, but most of them have been replanted. Cotton aphids were widespread, but they have now been eliminated and have not caused major losses. The seedlings in the Third District near Heze on the south bank of the Yellow River are growing well. The sorghum has already spiked, and the millet seedlings are more than a foot tall. In the Hebei-South area, some of the crops sown in white land (land that grows one crop a year) died due to strong winds and prolonged lack of rain. Later, locust nymphs also ate some of them. It was not until around June 25th that the area generally experienced rainfall, but it was not until the heavy rains in early July that the soil was completely saturated, which will have a good impact on the growth of the seedlings. Cotton is better in the Nangong and Xiatun areas, and some of those planted before Grain Rain have already flowered. From early April to mid-May, the Taiyue area suffered from wind and severe frost disasters, with a total of more than 1.4 million mu of autumn seedlings being frozen to death or injured. This was an unprecedented disaster in the area. Leaders at all levels fully organized the peasants to put all their labor and livestock into the rescue movement, and by the end of May, all the destroyed seedlings had been replanted. The millet that was not harmed is already two feet tall, the corn is three feet tall, and those sown early before the wheat harvest are five feet tall. In the Chahar Province, due to the large climate difference, the sowing time varies from place to place. In western Hebei, sowing was done around the Minor Fullness solar term, and the millet seedlings are one and a half to two feet tall, and the sorghum is more than one person tall. The situation is very good. The growth of seedlings in southern Chahar and northern Yan is also similar. Only northern Chahar has a cold climate and late sowing, and the millet seedlings are about five or six inches tall. In the Suiyuan area, the main crop is naked oats. Except for Jining, the whole area had a thorough rain before June 21st, and the oat seedlings are more than two feet tall. Flax accounts for about 10 percent of the sown area, and the general situation is still good, except for individual areas. The main autumn crop in the Taiyuan area is millet. There was a spring drought before May, which had some impact, but the situation improved after the rain.
    From the perspective of the entire North China region, the growth of seedlings this year is generally good. In order to consolidate the achievements already made and ensure a good autumn harvest, it is necessary to continue to build water conservancy projects to fight drought and protect seedlings, do a good job in flood control so that the rivers do not overflow and cause disasters, and always be vigilant against the recurrence of insect pests. These three things are the major keys to ensuring the completion of this year's agricultural production. Party and government cadres leading agricultural production in various places should carry forward the spirit of fighting drought and insect plagues, continue to work hard, and should not be in the slightest bit careless.

专栏：庄稼长得怎么样了？

　　华北各地战胜水旱虫蝗
  　全区青苗成长良好
    各行署农业处长谈农情
    【本报专访】“华北的庄稼长得怎么样了？”记者以此为题往访来平出席华北农业生产会议的各行署农业处长，承答复如下：
    冀中区今年的棉花大部是点种的，一般地区的棉苗已有半尺多高，好的地方如四分区则有一尺多高了。点种的花生都已圆壳、开花，情形甚为良好。在五月二十一日前播种的水浇地区的谷苗、玉米、高粱及麦收后播种的晚田作物都长得不坏。只要今后不再发生水灾虫害等，今年的收成可能不错。冀东部分地区曾发生蝗蝻，因捕打及时，损失轻微，棉蚜虫也因领导上紧急防治和最近的一次大雨，未能酿成灾害，棉花已有半尺多高，玉米、高粱、花生等均长得很好。一般青苗都已锄过二遍，也有锄过三遍的。今年该区果树受虫害较重，旱、虫、雹灾对青苗未造成重大损失，最近的一次大雨，很有助于禾苗的生长，只要今后雨水均匀，不发生大的水患或虫害，估计可能有八九成年景。太行区各地青苗到七月初已普遍锄过两遍。青苗生长的情形以三专区最好，四、五专区次之。领导上和广大群众密切结合，积极剿蝗，挽救了一百四十余万亩青苗。该区山地较多，常常苦旱，水利是决定农业生产的重要因素之一，为了巩固春耕已得成绩，必须注意抗旱保苗，行署现仍加紧兴修水利，各地共预算以二百多万斤粮食来进行这一工作，行署并于六月份派人在豫北成立水利局，组成水利工作队，到各地检查河防勘察水利。冀鲁豫区有五十一县发生严重虫灾，危害最大者是土蚕，春苗被吃掉很多，但大部已补种上；棉蚜虫曾普遍发生，现已消灭，也未酿成重大损失。青苗以三分区黄河南岸菏泽附近长得好，高粱已出穗子，谷苗好的有一尺多高了。冀南区因大风和长期不雨，白地（一年种一季作物）播种的作物有部分回苗（死掉了），后来蝗蝻也吃掉一部分。直到六月二十五日前后全区普遍降雨，但到七月初的几次大雨后才全部下透，对于青苗的生长会有好的影响。棉花以南宫、夏津一带较好，谷雨前种上者有的已开花。太岳区于四月初旬到五月中旬曾患风灾和大冻灾，共有一百四十多万亩秋苗被冻死或冻伤，这在该区是一次空前未有的灾害。各级领导全力组织农民所有劳畜力投入抢救运动，于五月底便将全部毁苗补种完毕。没有被害的谷子已有两尺多高，玉茭有三尺高，麦收前下种早的则有五尺多高了。察哈尔省因气候差别较大，各地播种时期不一，冀西一带在小满前后下种，谷苗有一尺半到二尺高，高粱有一人多高了，情形甚好；察南雁北青苗成长的情形也差不多，仅察北气候寒冷，下种晚，谷苗约五、六寸高。绥远地区的农作物以莜麦为主，除集宁外，全区已于六月二十一日前下了透雨，麦苗有二尺多高了，胡麻约占播种面积的百分之十，除去个别地区，一般情况尚良好。太原区的大秋作物以谷子为主，五月前春旱，受了一些影响，以后下了雨，情况好转。
    从华北全区来看，今年青苗成长情况一般良好。为了巩固已得成绩，保证一个好的秋收，今后必须继续兴修水利以抗旱保苗，作好防汛工作使各河不致泛滥成灾，并随时警惕虫害的再次发生，这三件事情是保证完成今年农业生产的重大关键，各地领导农业生产的党政干部应发挥和旱灾虫灾斗争的精神，继续努力，而不应有丝毫的麻痹大意。
