Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th: The Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Civil Affairs convened a civil affairs conference from June 7th to 22nd, attended by provincial and county/municipal civil affairs officials, to discuss the construction of grassroots political power and how to ensure the completion of bandit suppression tasks. Chairman Wu Zhipu delivered a report at the meeting on the current situation in Henan. He pointed out that Henan Province has been completely liberated and has begun to embark on the road to construction. However, the remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries are still stirring, organizing bandits, adopting scattered and concealed sabotage methods, engaging in arson, murder, and looting, organizing secret societies, and plotting riots, attempting to undermine our rear area's production and construction. Eliminating bandits and stabilizing social order in order to restore and develop production is the most pressing demand of the people of Henan at present. To this end, future civil affairs work must also allocate forces in a planned and focused manner to strive to complete the arduous and glorious task of bandit suppression. He Chongsheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, summarized everyone's opinions and put forward the following points as the central tasks of Henan's civil affairs work in the future: First, a large number of rural political powers in Henan are still controlled by reactionary feudal forces and must be quickly transformed. In general new areas, the Baojia system must be abolished, and we must start to promote and train peasant activists and revolutionary intellectuals, appointing them as township heads and village chiefs to establish new rural political power. In key areas for mobilizing the masses, peasant associations should be established, peasant representative conferences should be convened, and township governments should be elected to achieve the progressive transformation of grassroots political power. Second, in cities, the rural viewpoint must be overcome, with the municipal government as the grassroots political power organization directly meeting with the masses, strengthening mass organizations and economic and public security institutions, abolishing the street and district levels of political power, transforming districts into dispatched organs of the city, and fully utilizing representatives from all walks of life to connect with the masses and discuss policy plans before the convocation of the People's Representative Conference. Third, the central task of Henan in the second half of this year is bandit suppression, opposition to local tyrants, and mobilization of the masses. Civil affairs work must be combined with and guarantee the completion of this central task. The main tasks are to appropriately allocate cadres, strengthen public security work and judicial work, draw necessary forces to accompany the army in bandit suppression, and conduct ideological mobilization among all cadres, strengthen discipline education, promote a spirit of hard struggle, and launch a bandit suppression meritorious service campaign.
