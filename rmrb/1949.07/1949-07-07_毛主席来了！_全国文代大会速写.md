　　Chairman Mao is Here!
  　A Quick Sketch of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers
    Bai Sheng
    Yesterday at 7:20 PM, as Comrade Zhou Enlai was nearing the end of his report to the delegates, Chairman Mao suddenly appeared on the stage. Immediately, thunderous applause echoed throughout the hall. The brilliant floodlights instantly illuminated the entire venue, shining on the great people's leader, shining on every delegate in the hall. All the photographers aimed their lenses, and the delegates stood up, enthusiastically shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"
    Amidst the enthusiastic applause from the entire audience, Zhou Enlai temporarily paused his report. Chairman Mao walked to the front of the stage, repeatedly nodding to the delegates in acknowledgement. Amid the applause, he delivered a brief and powerful speech to all the delegates, welcoming the people's writers, the people's artists, or the organizers of the people's literary and artistic work who were present. Warm applause and cheers resounded throughout the hall.
    Chairman Mao cordially shook hands with the people on the stage. Only when Comrade Zhou Enlai continued his speech did the delegates gradually quiet down and sit down, with hundreds of pairs of eyes still affectionately gazing at this great people's leader. Soon, Zhou Enlai's speech once again captivated everyone. Chairman Mao also quietly sat down next to the recording desk on the stage, listening attentively. At times, he also looked at the delegates below the stage, occasionally revealing an amiable smile.
    When Comrade Zhou Enlai, in concluding his speech, said, "Delegates, we should thank Chairman Mao for pointing out the direction of literature and art for us..." the entire audience once again burst into enthusiastic applause.
    At this moment, Guo Moruo, amidst the applause, excitedly said into the microphone: "Fellow delegates, today we are holding this meeting, and we are grateful that Vice Chairman Zhou has given us a six-hour report, and we are even more grateful that Chairman Mao has personally come to participate and guide us. This gives us great encouragement..." Before he could finish speaking, the delegates below the stage immediately gave another burst of enthusiastic applause to Chairman Mao. Amid the applause, Guo Moruo continued to speak, expressing his complete acceptance of Vice Chairman Zhou's entire instructions to the delegates and his intention to be Chairman Mao's student with the greatest enthusiasm! Following Guo Moruo's words, the entire audience once again shouted cheers and applauded loudly. At this moment, Guo Moruo enthusiastically shouted: "All delegates, let us shout a few slogans at the end:
    "Let all literary and art workers unite! Study Mao Zedong Thought! Create people's literature and art! Long live the liberation of the Chinese people! Long live the Chinese Communist Party!"
    "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live!

　　毛主席来了！
  　全国文代大会速写
    柏生
    昨天下午七点二十分，当周恩来同志正向代表们报告将近结束时，突然主席台上毛主席出现了，立时雷动的掌声响澈了整个会场，辉煌的水银灯，顿时照亮了全场，照耀着伟大的人民领袖，照耀着会场的每个代表，所有的摄影记者都把镜头对准，代表们都站了起来，热烈地高声地欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！……
    在全场热烈的鼓掌中，周恩来暂时地停止了报告，毛主席走向台前向代表们连连点头答礼，并且在掌声中向全体代表们作了简短有力的讲话，欢迎到会的人民的文学家，人民的艺术家，或者是人民的文学艺术工作的组织者。热烈的掌声和欢呼响彻了全场。
    毛主席亲切地和主席台上的人握了手，直到周恩来同志继续讲下去的时候，代表们才渐渐安静的坐了下去，几百双眼睛还都亲切地端望着这个伟大的人民领袖。不久周恩来的讲话才又吸引了每一个人。毛主席也沉静地坐到主席台上的记录席旁，注意地听着，有时他也把眼睛望着台下的代表们，不时露出亲切的微笑。
    当周恩来同志在结束讲话中说到：“代表们，我们应该感谢毛主席给我们指出的文艺方向，……”的时候，全场又一次热烈地鼓起掌来。
    这时，郭沫若在掌声中对着麦克风兴奋地说：“诸位代表，今天我们开这个会，承周副主席给我们作了六个钟头的报告，又承毛主席亲自来参加，来指导我们，这给我们很大的鼓励……”他的话还没有说完，台下的代表们立即对着毛主席又是一阵热烈地鼓掌，在掌声中郭沫若继续讲下去，他表示完全接受周副主席给大会代表们的整个指示和以最大的热忱作毛主席的学生！跟着郭沫若的话，全场又高声地欢呼鼓掌起来，这时郭沫若热情地喊着：全体代表们，让我们最后高呼几个口号：
    一切文艺工作者团结起来！学习毛泽东的思想！创造人民的文艺！中国人民解放万岁！中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！万岁！
