  　Organizes Production Reduction and Re-employment in Small Salt Production Areas

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd—The Shandong Salt Bureau, in view of the flourishing production and transportation of sea salt, has decided to continue implementing the policy of organizing production reduction and re-employment in small salt production areas, gradually eliminating scattered small salt production areas, and developing concentrated large salt production areas. This policy was decided at the Bureau's salt affairs meeting in February this year. However, because salt affairs cadres did not deeply recognize that, due to the development of the victorious revolutionary situation, the liberated areas already possess several conditions for large-scale production, some small-scale production must adapt to this situation and be changed, and one cannot stick to the old ways. Therefore, they did not properly persuade salt farmers to change professions and actively help them solve the difficulties of re-employment, which resulted in this policy not being well implemented. During the Anti-Japanese War and the early period of the Liberation War, in order to defeat the economic blockade of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries and increase salt tax revenue to support the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, Shandong and the coastal areas of northern Jiangsu widely developed salt production in small salt production areas. The output of these small salt production areas reached 9 million dan in 1948, and their production and transportation costs were equivalent to 17 to 26 jin of grain per dan. However, due to the victory of the Shandong Liberation War in the autumn of last year, the divided state of salt production and salt transportation ended, and the sea salt from the Huaibei Salt Field, Yangjiao Salt Field (near Yangjiaogou at the mouth of the Xiaoqing River), with an annual output of 30 million dan, and the Changlu Salt Field north of the Yellow River estuary, is sold everywhere; in addition, with increasingly smooth railways and river transport, the cost of sea salt per dan is only equivalent to 7.5 to 11.5 jin of grain, which is far lower than the cost of small salt. Therefore, if the scattered small salt production areas do not immediately reduce production and enable individual salt farmers to change professions, the lives of salt farmers will face serious difficulties due to the inability to sell salt. For this reason, at the salt affairs meeting held in late June, the Bureau specifically emphasized that the focus of work in the second half of the year is to continue implementing the work of organizing production reduction and re-employment in small salt production areas, bringing it to a conclusion. To assist these salt farmers in changing professions, we should help them prioritize the sale of existing salt, use the proceeds from salt sales for new businesses, and solve various difficulties in the process of re-employment. For salt farmers in small salt production areas who are temporarily unable to change professions or who need to continue production, we should stabilize their production morale, increase production, reduce costs, and focus on pilot projects for salt production and sales cooperatives, so that individual and scattered small salt production areas and individual transportation and sales will gradually move towards centralized production and collective transportation and sales.

### 山东盐务局　组织小盐区减产转业

　　山东盐务局
  　组织小盐区减产转业
    【新华社济南二十三日电】山东盐务局鉴于海盐产运盛畅，决定继续贯彻组织小盐区减产转业，逐渐取消分散的小盐区，发展集中的大盐区的方针。这一方针在今年二月该局盐务会议上即已决定。但由于盐务工作干部没有深刻认识由于革命胜利形势的发展，解放区已拥有若干大生产的条件，某些小生产必须适应这一形势而加以改变，不能再固守旧有一套，因此未很好地说服盐民转业，并积极帮助他们解决转业困难，致使这一方针未能很好地被贯彻执行。在抗日战争时期及解放战争初期，为战胜日寇与国民党反动派的经济封锁及增加盐税收入，以支援抗日战争和解放战争，山东与苏北沿海曾广泛地发展小盐区的盐业生产。这些小盐区在一九四八年产量达九百万担，其生产成本和运输成本每担合粮食十七斤至二十六斤。但由于去年秋季山东解放战争的胜利，盐产与盐运的分割状态结束，年产三千万担的淮北盐场、羊角盐场（小清河口羊角沟附近）及黄河口以北的长芦盐场的海盐通销各地；加以铁道与河运日益畅通，海盐每担成本仅合粮食七斤半至十一斤半，远较小盐成本为低。因此，分散的小盐区如不立即减产并使个体的盐民转业，则盐民生活将因产盐无法销售而发生严重困难。为此，该局在六月下旬召开的盐务会议上，特再强调下半年的工作中心是：继续贯彻组织小盐区减产转业的工作，使之告一段落。为协助这些盐民转业，应协助他们优先推销存盐，将销盐所得用于新业，解决转业中的各种困难。对一时无法转业或有必要继续生产的小盐区盐民，则应稳定其生产情绪，提高生产，减低成本，并有重点地试办盐业产销合作社，使个体分散的小盐区和个体的运销，逐步走向集中生产和集体运销。
