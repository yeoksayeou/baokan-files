Che Xiangchen believed that this meeting was very democratic, united, and successful. He advocated combining cultural education with economic construction, and required the education sector to pay attention to cultivating talent and teachers for national construction. Gao Zhenwu, a veteran educator who had been a teacher for forty-five years, hoped that education workers would regard the people's education cause as a lifelong career. Ji Wenfu, based on his personal experience after arriving in the liberated area, explained that the combination of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the people is the source of all strength, and that China's education must undergo a great revolution, applying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to education. The scientist Ding Xilin discussed the issues of science education and reforming the school system, and called on education workers and scientific workers to work together to improve the level of science education, train young education workers, popularize science education, and pay attention to the production of scientific education instruments. Gu Mei spoke on: "Education must be closely integrated with politics. Education workers should change their past aloof ideas of not asking about politics, participate in politics, and serve the politics of the people." Wei Que emphasized in his speech that education workers should understand the great changes that have taken place in society after the people turned over, and that education should start from the actual needs of the people. Chen Heqin introduced his observations from visiting Soviet education, believing that the Soviet Union's cultural and educational experience is worth learning. The scientist Wu Youxun said: "The Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao attach great importance to cultural education and science. The people's governments in the liberated areas are using great efforts to run education. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, China's cultural education and scientific construction will certainly have a bright future." The national educator Bai Shouyi talked about the education of the Hui people, pointing out that under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the education of the Hui people could not develop. He believes that under the New Democratic education policy, the education of the Hui people should and can be greatly developed in the future. Mayor Ye pointed out first in his speech: The unity of education workers to promote the development of education, science and culture has made a great contribution to the Chinese people, especially the Chinese youth. Mayor Ye said: "Our education must arm young students with systematic scientific knowledge and cultivate a scientific worldview and collectivism. We must cultivate the younger generation to be intelligent, hardworking, and brave in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education. Our education must be combined with struggle and with production. We must strengthen internationalism and revolutionary patriotism, and cultivate the younger generation into patriots with an internationalist spirit."

Finally, Chairman Dong Biwu delivered a closing speech, pointing out that this meeting was very successful, demonstrating that education workers have begun to unite under the revolutionary line of New Democracy and the cultural and educational line of New Democracy. After Chairman Dong's speech, the meeting was declared adjourned.
