　　Thoughts After Seeing "Shell"
　　Chen Shijin
　　"Shell" is a play performed by the Political Propaganda Team of the Northeast Military Region to cooperate with the transformation of urban and rural policies and the current central task of industrial construction. Its content reflects and solves some problems in industrial construction work. In terms of its character and achievements in grasping policies, reflecting, and guiding reality, it can have the same educational significance as the "Bridge" of the Northeast Electric Company. Below, I will write some personal thoughts in connection with future literary and artistic work.
　　The subject matter of this play focuses on conveying policies and explaining problems, and the storytelling is not strong. However, under the proper handling of the playwright, various realistic problems are rationally expressed and resolved. There are no unnecessary decorations or renderings in the plot or acting, but the audience's impression is kind, tense, clear, and powerful. There is no feeling of stiffness or dullness, so that the educational and artistic qualities of this play have both achieved a certain effect, completing the requirement that all departments must serve economic construction.
　　In the past, some people, especially those who still retained the erroneous concept of "art for art's sake," often thought that doing so would form a didactic or sloganized style, reducing the artistic effect. Now, due to the performance of this play, we know that art, policy, and reality can be well combined and used to help each other, which will not weaken the artistic quality, but will strengthen its artistic effect. This shows that as long as it is handled well, the audience will still "love to see and hear." The only question is how well the literary and artistic workers understand the policies, how well they experience reality, and what their personal artistic cultivation is like.
　　This play begins by criticizing some shortcomings of the higher-level industrial cadres (general factory director) in our industrial construction. Because our current focus of work has shifted to construction, the expression of various art forms should not only be used to strengthen or unify the fighting spirit of encouragement and praise, but should also analyze and criticize the shortcomings and incorrect styles that arise in work and reality. As this play shows, making the masses aware of some shortcomings in industrial construction, improving them realistically, and achieving the completion of tasks and solving problems can strengthen the educational effect. This point may be worth our literary and artistic workers' reference and adoption.
　　In the past, we rarely used drama for the subject matter of land reform. Today, due to the development of the situation, our work objects are different, our subject matter is complex and diverse, and the personalities of the characters need to be further grasped. Therefore, the appropriate use of various art forms needs to be reconsidered based on the requirements of reality. As this play shows, the exposure and resolution of some complex problems in economic construction would not be easy to handle if shouldered by Yangko or old opera, so the drama form was adopted.
　　"Shell" was written, directed, and performed in a blitz-style short time, which can cooperate with the policy to achieve the role of timely reflection of reality and guidance of reality. Naturally, we must also pay attention to preparatory work, such as deeply experiencing the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, analyzing the real situation, studying theory and policy, and combining reality and policy with art very naturally through specific people and events to write profound, vivid works that guide reality.

### “炮弹”观后

　　“炮弹”观后
    陈适今
    “炮弹”是东北军区政治宣传队为配合城乡政策的转变和工业建设这一当前中心任务而演出的一个话剧，内容反映并解决工业建设工作中的一些问题。就其抓紧政策反映并指导现实的性格和成就说，是可以和东电的“桥”有同样教育意义的。下面联系今后文艺工作方面，写出一点个人的感想。
    这剧的题材是着重在传达政策，说明问题，故事性并不强。但在剧作者的适当处理下，使各种现实问题得到合理的表现和解决，在剧情上演技上都没有加什么不必要的装饰和渲染，而给观众的印象却是亲切紧张鲜明有力，没有生硬或沉闷的感觉，使这剧的教育性和艺术性同样达到了一定效果，完成了目前一切部门都要为经济建设服务的要求。
    过去有些人，尤其是残留着“为艺术而艺术”错误观念的人们，常是以为这样作将形成说教式或标语口号化，减低了艺术效果。现在由于这个剧的演出，我们知道艺术与政策和现实是可能很好结合相互为用的，不但不会削弱艺术性，而将加强它的艺术效果。这说明只要处理得好，观众一样会“喜见乐闻”的，问题只在文艺工作者对政策的认识如何，对现实的体验如何，以及个人的艺术修养如何而已。
    这个剧是由批评我们工业建设方面上级工干（总厂长）的一些缺点写起的，因为目前我们的工作重心已转向建设，那么在表现各种艺术形式上的，就该不止为加强或统一斗争情绪的激励和表扬，同时也应该对工作及现实中产生的缺点和不正确作风加以分析和批判。象这个剧所表现的，使群众认识到工业建设方面的一些缺欠实事求是地加以改进，达到完成任务解决问题，这就可以加强教育作用，这一点，也许是值得我们文艺工作者参考采用的。
    过去我们在土地改革的题材上，很少利用话剧这形式。今天由于形势开展，我们的工作对象不同了，我们的题材是复杂和多样性了，人物个性比较进一步要掌握了。因之对于各种艺术形式的适当利用，就有基于从现实要求出发重新加以考虑的必要了。象这个剧所表现的经济建设方面一些复杂问题的暴露和解决，假如由秧歌或旧剧来负担，就不大容易胜任，所以就采用了话剧形式。
    “炮弹”是以突击式的短时间编、导、演出的，这才能配合政策作到及时反映现实和指导现实的作用。自然也得注意准备工作，如深刻体验工农兵生活，分析现实情况，学习理论和政策，通过具体的人物、事件，使现实和政策与艺术很自然的相结合，写出深刻、有血有肉的指导现实的作品。
