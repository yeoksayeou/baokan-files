The National Locomotive Affairs Conference Continued Yesterday
Reports on Typical Examples of Contracted Operation and Maintenance

[This newspaper dispatch] The National Locomotive Affairs Conference continued on the 2nd, after a one-day recess for "July 1st" (CCP Founding Day). Labor models and representatives from various regions reported on typical examples of contracted operation and maintenance. In the morning, Yang Yaoxing, the driver of the "February 7th Memorial" locomotive, a typical locomotive from Tianjin East Station, reported that although they had not implemented the contracted operation system for long, the daily kilometerage of the locomotive had gradually increased. From May 15th to May 30th, the locomotive traveled a total of 5048.7 kilometers, and on June 3rd, the daily kilometerage reached 605.6 kilometers, breaking the previous record of Tianjin Station. Employees of the No. 1830 locomotive, a typical locomotive from Tianjin North Station, helped repair the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. In March, April and May, they completed 15,611.7 kilometers of military transport tasks, creating brilliant achievements. Representatives from the Jinan Zhou section, after explaining the situation of the contracted operation system in that section, specifically pointed out the irrationality and inefficiency of the old scheduling system. The excessive stop times during train journeys wasted the locomotive's operational efficiency, exceeding the operational time by 130 percent. The time locomotives spent stationed and staying in other sections and in their own section accounted for 67 percent of the running time, greatly hindering the locomotive's operation. Therefore, the establishment of a new scheduling system was essential.

In the afternoon, Yao Zhiping, a representative of the Model Third Contracted Repair Group of the Harbin Locomotive Depot in Northeast China, reported on typical examples of contracted repair. He said that the combination of contracted repair and contracted operation is extremely necessary in locomotive work. Because they are enthusiastic about their work, carefully inquire about the problems of each locomotive entering the depot, carefully inspect them, and automatically teach the crew members maintenance work, 40 percent of the crew members of the 18 locomotives they contracted have learned maintenance work. Therefore, from the establishment of the contracted repair system in December of last year to the beginning of May of this year, eight of the 18 locomotives they contracted have exceeded the A-level inspection kilometerage, and the highest has exceeded 80,000 kilometers without an A-level inspection. The average A-level inspection man-hours for the locomotives they contracted in April was 155 hours and 16 minutes per unit, a reduction of 69 hours and 44 minutes compared to the standard A-level inspection man-hours of 225 hours. The average C-level inspection man-hours in April was 74.5 minutes per unit, a reduction of 69.10 minutes compared to the standard C-level inspection man-hours of 144 hours. The establishment of this contracted repair system not only guarantees the quality of the locomotives, but also saves a lot of waste. The group also joined forces with two other contracted repair groups to form a large joint group, helping each other and jointly contracting repairs. From May 21st to May 30th, this large joint group carried out a "Red May" shock mission for victory, completing one A-level inspection in these ten days, fully demonstrating the role of the joint group and setting a model for contracted repair groups in various regions. Liu Yulin, a representative of the Fengtai contracted repair group, explained his experience in repairing axles and compared in detail the working methods and attitudes of workers before and after liberation. He said that in the past, under the Japanese puppet and Kuomintang regimes, they had never done meticulous work, nor could they have worked properly. Today, they are liberated, and they are not only stepping up their work, but also seeking ways to ensure that the axles do not overheat, fully demonstrating the creativity of the workers, and creating a wealth of experience in repairing axles.

　　全国机务会议昨继续进行
  　报告包乘包修典型
    【本报讯】全国机务会议于“七一”休会一天后，二日继续举行，各地劳动模范、代表作包乘包修典型报告。上午天津东站典型机车二七纪念号司机杨耀兴在报告中说，他们虽然实行包乘制没有多久，但日车公里已渐提高，该车从五月十五日至五月三十日，共行走了五○四八·七公里，六月三日的日车公里竟达六○五·六公里，打破天津站以往的纪录。天津北站典型机车一八三○号员工曾帮助抢修津浦北段，他们在三、四、五三个月内完成了一五六一一·七公里的军运任务，创造辉煌的成绩。济南州段的代表在说明了该段实行包乘制的情形之后，特指出旧的调度制度的不合理，效率不高，使列车在中途停点时分过长，浪费了机车的运用效率，竟超过运用时间百分之一百三十，机车在外段驻在及在本段停留时间占运行时间百分之六十七，大大妨碍了机车的运行，因此建立新的调度制实属必要。
    下午，东北哈尔滨机务段模范第三包修组代表姚志平报告包修典型事迹。他说，包修与包车的结合在机务工作中万分必要，由于他们热心干活，详细询问每个入库机车的毛病，仔细检查，并自动给乘务员教导检修工作，他们包的十八台机车中有百分之四十的乘务员学会了检修工作，因此从去年十二月建立包修后，到今年五月初止，他们所包的十八台机车有八台超过了甲检公里，最高的竟超过八万公里以上，未曾甲检。他们所包的机车乙检工时在四月份平均每台一五五时十六分，较乙检标准工时二二五时减少六九时四四分，丙检工时在四月份平均每台七四·五分较丙检标准工时一四四时减少六九·一○分。这种包修制的建立不但保证了机车质量，而且节省了不少的浪费。该组并联合两个包修组，组成大联合组，互相帮助，共同包修，他们这个大联合组，从五月二十一到五月三十日为胜利突击红五月任务，在这十天当中，完成一个甲检，充分发挥了联合组的作用，给各地包修组做了模范的榜样。丰台包修组代表刘玉林在说明其修理大轴的经验时，曾详细比较解放前后工人的工作方法与态度。他说，在过去日伪国民党时代，他们从没精心干过活，也不可能好好的工作，今天解放了，他们不仅加紧干活，而且多方寻求方法，怎样保证大轴不发热，充分发挥了工人们的创造性，并且创造了修大轴的丰富经验。
