    Jiamusi General Cooperative to Establish Relations with Tianjin
    [Tianjin News] The Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has achieved remarkable results since it began developing urban-rural trade and inter-regional exchanges. In addition to the exchange of goods through cooperative warehouses by cooperatives from various regions coming to Tianjin, the Municipal General Cooperative signed two barter contracts with the Heilongjiang Provincial General Cooperative on the 26th of this month. One contract involves the Municipal General Cooperative exchanging 500 bolts of Tianjin "Red Cannon" cloth and 80 bolts of Second Factory "Five Blessings" cloth for 241,550 jin of sorghum rice from the Heilongjiang Provincial General Cooperative, with delivery in Tianjin. Cloth can be collected starting from the 26th, and grain will be delivered on August 11th. The other contract, involving yarn for cloth, entails the Heilongjiang Provincial General Cooperative transporting grain to exchange for 300 pieces of 20-count yarn from the Tianjin Trading Company, and then using the yarn to exchange for 8,100 bolts of white cloth from the Municipal General Cooperative, also with delivery in Tianjin. Yarn will be delivered on July 30th, and cloth will be delivered in two installments from August 1st to September 15th. This arrangement not only facilitates the flow of goods between regions but also solves the problem of raw materials and sales for the cotton textile production groups organized by the Municipal General Cooperative. Recently, the Municipal General Cooperative has been discussing further contracts with the Heilongjiang Provincial General Cooperative and the Jiamusi General Cooperative.
    [Further News] The grain exchanged for cloth in the Northeast by the General Cooperative has been fully transported back after the previous shipment of 430,000 jin of red sorghum. The final batch included 645,000 jin of soybeans, 49,000 jin of red beans, and 118,080 jin of corn. In addition, over 7,400 burlap sacks were ordered from the Northeast and have also been delivered.
