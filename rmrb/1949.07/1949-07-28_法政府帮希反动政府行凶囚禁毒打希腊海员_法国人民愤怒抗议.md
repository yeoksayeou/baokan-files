Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: According to TASS, Paris: The French National Committee for Aid to Democratic Greece recently protested vehemently against the French government's atrocities of imprisoning a group of Greek sailors who refused to return to Royalist Fascist Greece. A communique issued by the committee, published in Parisian newspapers, stated that these Greek sailors, arrested in Marseilles, are still being held in French prisons. Some of them have already obtained entry visas to Czechoslovakia, but the French authorities refuse to grant them French exit visas. The communique pointed out that the arrested Greek sailors had been subjected to 48 hours of torture. The French authorities used special instruments to clamp the heads and chests of the victims. During the interrogation, the arrestees were hung in the air five stories high in the French secret police building. Because they could not fabricate any crimes, the court, after the trial, had to decide to release them due to the inability to fabricate crimes. However, they are still being held in prison.

　　The French Communist Party's "L'Humanité" expressed indignation at this and published Simon Téry's interview on the truth about the mistreatment of Greek sailors. Sailor Iricsis Knaupas said that he was beaten at the police headquarters and almost suffocated to death. Another sailor, Koufalis, was forced to kneel on the edge of iron shackles and beaten on the back with an iron rod. Then they dragged him to the window and threatened him with a pistol, saying, "Jump, and we will say you committed suicide." The most severely tortured was the sailor Scifotos. He was tortured first, and then the police of Mosher took him to a Greek ship, where he was interrogated and brutally tortured by Royalist Fascist police from Athens. Then he was taken back to the police headquarters and tortured again. In order to make him confess to a crime he had not committed, his chest was placed in an iron jacket, and the jacket was gradually tightened with a spiral, and his ribs were broken in this way.

　　法政府帮希反动政府行凶囚禁毒打希腊海员
  　法国人民愤怒抗议
    【新华社北平二十七日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国援助民主希腊全国委员会，日前猛烈抗议法国政府囚禁一批拒绝回到保皇法西斯希腊去的希腊海员的暴行。巴黎报纸发表该委员会公报称：这些在马赛被捕的希腊海员们，仍被囚禁在法国监狱中。其中有些人已获捷克斯洛伐克入境签证，但法国当局拒绝给予他们以法国的出境签证。公报指出：被捕的希腊海员们，曾受到四十八小时的刑讯。法国当局使用了夹紧受刑者的头部与胸部的特殊刑具。在受讯期间，被捕者们被吊在法国秘密警察大厦五层楼高的空中。因为捏造不出罪名，法庭在审讯之后虽因无法制造罪名而不得不决定释放他们。但他们迄今仍被囚禁在狱中。
    法共人道报对此表示愤慨，并发表西蒙·泰利采访的希腊海员被虐待的真相。海员伊里克西斯·克瑙帕斯说：他在警察总监部遭到毒打，几乎窒息而死。另一个海员库法利斯被罚跪在铁镣的边缘上被用铁棍打他的背。随后人家把他拖到窗前，用手枪威胁他说：“跳下去，我们就说你是自杀”。受刑最厉害的是海员斯岂福托斯，他先受了刑，随后摩许的警察把他带到一只希腊船上，在那里他受到雅典来的保皇法西斯警察的讯问和残酷拷打，然后他又被带回警察总监部再度加以拷打。为了使他招承他没有犯过的罪，他的胸部被放在铁马甲中，用螺旋把马甲逐渐收紧，他的肋骨就这样地被折断了。
