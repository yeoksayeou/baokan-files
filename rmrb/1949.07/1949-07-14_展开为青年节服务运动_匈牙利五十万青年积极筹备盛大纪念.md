Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 13th: "Youths, unite! Advance for lasting peace, democracy, national independence, and a better future!" This is the slogan of the World Youth Festival, which will be held in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, from August 14th to 28th. The work of the World Youth Festival is being actively prepared by the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the International Union of Students, and the "host" Hungarian People's Youth League. 500,000 Hungarian youths are involved in the "movement to serve the Youth Festival." In addition to arranging the venues, they are also studying the culture, folk songs, and youth life of various countries, arranging the dormitories of universities and middle schools for young friends from afar, and collecting gifts to be presented to delegations from various countries.

After two months of efforts, the outline of the venue is already impressive. There are two activity centers for the Youth Festival: one is the beautiful Margaret Island on the Danube River, and the other is Budapest Park. A large open-air stage has been set up in this park for the performance of dramas or operas. Dance and music programs will be held in the animal park, which is famous throughout Europe. A poetic medieval castle standing on the lakeside of the park (the Budapest headquarters of the Hungarian Young Pioneers) has been lent to the Youth Festival by the Hungarian People's Youth League. Youth representatives from various countries will meet here to introduce the youth movements of various countries. Next to the castle is a row of pavilions prepared for exhibitions. The order of the exhibitions is: (1) World Federation of Democratic Youth and International Union of Students; (2) the Soviet Union and the fighting youths of various countries; (3) democratic youths in capitalist countries; (4) youths in New Democratic countries. Opposite the international exhibition pavilions is a row of small buildings, identical in appearance to the exhibition pavilions, which is the preparatory committee for the international charity bazaar. Considering that everyone will be particularly interested in the folk and handmade art and various souvenirs of various countries, it was also decided to set up charity bazaar tents on the most prosperous streets in the city. Near the international charity bazaar is the sports field. The 10th World Congress Summer Games, which will be held at the same time as the Youth Festival, will be held here. Representatives participating in the Games will be invited to participate in the main programs of the Youth Festival. Participants in the Youth Festival can also participate in the various competitions of the Games.

Large delegations from various countries will participate in the Youth Festival. The Polish youth delegation organized by the Polish Youth League has 650 people. It is expected that 12,000 foreign representatives and 150,000 Hungarian youths will participate in the demonstration at the end of the Youth Festival.

The International Youth Festival Committee, which is responsible for the preparatory work, is constantly receiving congratulatory messages from all parties.

The congratulatory message from Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the Presidium of the Permanent Committee of the World Peace Congress, said: "In a brotherly spirit, I pay tribute to the young people and students who are coming to Budapest to participate in their great festival. We will join hands and work together for peace and for building a meaningful world!"

　　展开为青年节服务运动
  　匈牙利五十万青年积极筹备盛大纪念
    【新华社布拉格十三日电】“青年们，团结起来！为争取持久和平、民主、民族独立和更美好的前途而前进！”这是八月十四日至二十八日将在匈京布达佩斯举行的世界青年节的口号。世界青年节的工作正由世界民主青联、国际学联和“主人”匈牙利人民青年联盟，积极筹备中。五十万匈牙利青年卷入了“为青年节服务的运动”。他们除了布置会场外，还着手研究各国的文化、民歌和青年生活，布置给远道而来的青年朋友住宿的大中学校舍，并收集献给各国代表团的礼物。
    经过了两个月的努力，会场的轮廓已经可观了。青年节的活动中心有两个：一个是多瑙河上秀丽的马格苏岛，一个是布达佩斯的公园。一座露天大舞台已在这个公园里搭起来，以备上演戏剧或歌剧。舞蹈和音乐节目则在闻名全欧洲的动物公园举行。矗立在公园湖滨的一所富有诗意的中世纪古堡（这是匈牙利少年先锋队的布达佩斯总部），已由匈牙利人民青年联盟借给青年节使用。各国的青年代表们，将在这里开会，介绍各国青年运动的情形。紧靠着古堡的，是一排准备作展览会用的亭子。展览的顺序是：（一）世界青联和世界学联；（二）苏联和战斗中的各国青年；（三）资本主义国家的民主青年；（四）新民主国家的青年。和国际展览亭遥遥相对的有一排小型建筑物，外表上和展览亭相同，那就是国际义卖场筹备会。估计到大家对各国民间的和手工的艺术品以及各种纪念物会特别发生兴趣，因此，还决定在市内最繁华的外街上加搭义卖蓬帐。国际义卖场的附近是运动场。和青年节同时举行的第十届世界大会夏季运动会，就在这里举行。参加运动会的代表们，将被邀参加青年节的主要节目。参加青年节的，也同样可以参加运动会的各项比赛。
    各国将有庞大的代表团参加青年节。由波兰青年联盟筹组的波兰青年代表团，就有六百五十人。预计在青年节最后举行示威时，将有一万二千外国代表和十五万匈牙利青年参加。
    负责筹备工作的国际青年节委员会，正不断收到各方的贺电。
    世界和平大会常设委员会主席团主席居里的贺电说：“谨以兄弟之谊向到布达佩斯参加自己的伟大节日的青年和学生们致敬。我们将携手并进，为和平，为建设一个有意义的世界而奋斗！
