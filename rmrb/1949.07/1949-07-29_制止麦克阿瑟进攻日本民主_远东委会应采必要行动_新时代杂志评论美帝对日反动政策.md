Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 28th: TASS Moscow, July 27th: New Era magazine, in discussing MacArthur's policy toward Japan, pointed out: MacArthur has launched a war against Japanese democracy and against the laboring people who are fighting to defend their own rights. When inspecting troops on the 4th of this month, MacArthur made a bloody roar. In fact, he was demanding that the labor movement be outlawed. After this, the Japanese cabinet immediately considered implementing emergency measures against the labor movement. Among the planned measures are banning the Communist Party, declaring a state of emergency, and ordering the police to kill on the spot "anyone who breaks into government agencies," etc. The strength of the Japanese police has been increased to more than two million.

New Era wrote: MacArthur has had experience with this kind of war. Forty-five years ago, when he was a young lieutenant, he was known for his vicious suppression of the Moro people in the Philippines. The shameful achievement of "victory" in suppressing the hunger march of veterans in Washington in 1932 should also be attributed to him. At that time, many veterans were killed or injured.

On July 13, the Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission, Pan Youxin, once again asked the commission to pay attention to MacArthur's actions. MacArthur is instigating and directing the Japanese reactionaries to launch an attack on the democratic forces in Japan, thereby seriously violating the principles of the Potsdam Declaration and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission. New Era wrote: The war launched by MacArthur's headquarters and its puppet Yoshida cabinet against Japanese democracy must no longer be tolerated. The Soviet public expects that the Far Eastern Commission should discuss this important and urgent issue without delay and take necessary actions.

　　制止麦克阿瑟进攻日本民主
  　远东委会应采必要行动
    新时代杂志评论美帝对日反动政策
    【新华社北平二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：新时代杂志在论及麦克阿瑟对日政策时指出：麦克阿瑟已向日本的民主发动战争，已向正在为维护切身权利而斗争的劳动人民发动战争。麦克阿瑟于本月四日检阅军队时，曾发表血腥的狂叫。事实上，他是在要求规定劳工运动为非法。此后，日本内阁立即就考虑实施反劳工运动的紧急措施。在计划着的措施中，有取缔共产党，宣布紧急状态，命令警察就地格杀“任何闯入政府机关的人”等等。日本警察的力量已增至二百万人以上。
    新时代写道：麦克阿瑟对于此种战争素有经验。四十五年以前，当他是青年中尉时，就以对菲律宾摩罗族人施行恶毒的镇压而出名。一九三二年弹压华盛顿退伍军人饥饿游行获得“胜利”的可耻功绩，也应归之于他。当时曾有许多退伍军人被杀或受伤。
    七月十三日，远东委员会苏联代表潘友新曾再次要求委员会注意麦克阿瑟的行动，麦克阿瑟是在鼓动并指使日本反动派对日本民主力量发动进攻，因而严重地违反了波茨坦声明的原则与远东委员会的决议。新时代写道：麦克阿瑟总部及其傀儡吉田内阁对日本民主所发动的战争，绝不能再予容忍了。苏联公众期望：远东委员会这次应毫不迟延地讨论这个紧要的重大问题，并采取必要的行动。
