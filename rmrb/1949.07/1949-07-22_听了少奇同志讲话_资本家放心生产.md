　　After Listening to Comrade Shaoqi's Speech
  　Capitalists Feel Assured and Produce
    In late April, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, a leading member of the CPC Central Committee, gave a detailed explanation in Tianjin to both labor and capital on the general policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." At the same time, the Tianjin municipal party and government leading organs and the Federation of Trade Unions also strengthened the leadership of the work of developing production and improving labor-capital relations in accordance with Comrade Shaoqi's instructions. This further enhanced the class consciousness of the working masses, corrected the attitude towards labor, eliminated ideological concerns of employees, and also encouraged the management sentiment of capitalists. Since hearing Comrade Shaoqi's speech, the workers of Hengyuan have actively put forward suggestions to the capitalists, improved labor-capital relations, and increased production. The reeling department also took the initiative to invite the deputy manager, factory director, and heads of various sections to a meeting to discuss ways to improve quality. At present, production review meetings have been established in each workshop of the yarn and cloth factories, where production management personnel and workers regularly review production together. Due to the establishment of the review system and the improvement of labor-capital relations, the average daily yarn production per spindle in June increased from 0.68 pounds before liberation to 0.74 pounds, and the phenomenon of substandard cotton yarn was eliminated, breaking the factory's all-time high record. In order to welcome "July 1st," the workers of Huaxin Dyeing Factory overcame various difficulties and dyed 5,000 pieces of cloth in eleven days, creating a new record in the factory's history. Workers in other departments actively improved tools and working methods, also saving the capitalists a huge amount of money. The production enthusiasm of the capitalists in each factory has also been significantly improved. For example, Hengyuan has recently purchased three new wire machines and is preparing to raise funds and purchase parts to repair all the more than 2,000 spindles that have not yet been repaired. Huaxin is currently drafting a comprehensive plan for developing production, and has made some improvements to factory management.
    The process of resuming production in various public and private yarn factories in Tianjin shows that, with the support of the government, and after correctly improving labor-capital relations, the production enthusiasm of both labor and capital can be improved, and production can be increased, which is of great benefit to both workers and factories. At present, the central issue of each factory is still to continue to implement the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital, and further adjust labor-capital relations, in order to better develop production.

### 听了少奇同志讲话　资本家放心生产

　　听了少奇同志讲话
  　资本家放心生产
    四月下旬，中共中央负责人之一刘少奇同志在津向劳资双方对“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的总方针加以详尽阐述，同时津市党政领导机关和职工会亦根据少奇同志的指示加强了发展生产和改善劳资关系工作的领导，这样就进一步提高了工人群众的阶级觉悟，端正了劳动态度；消除了职员思想顾虑；同时也鼓励了资本家的经营情绪。恒源工人自听了少奇同志讲话后，即积极地同资方提出建议，改善了劳资关系，提高了产量。摇纱部并主动邀请副经理、厂长和各科科长开会，讨论改进质量办法。现该厂纱布两场各车间均已建立了生产检讨会，由生产管理人员和工人定期一起检讨生产。由于检讨制度建立以及劳资关系的改善，六月份每锭平均日产纱由解放前的零点六八磅增至零点七四磅，并消灭了棉纱不合标准的现象，突破了该厂有史以来的最高纪录。华新染厂工人为迎接“七一”，克服种种困难，在十一天内染布五千匹，创造了该厂有史以来的新纪录。其他部门工人积极改进工具，改进工作方法，亦为资方节省了巨额款项。各厂资方的生产情绪，也都显著地提高，如恒源最近已新购三部钢丝机，并准备捐募资金，和购买零件，将尚未修好的二千余枚纱锭全部修好。华新最近正拟订发展生产的全盘计划，对于工厂管理已有所改进。
    天津各公私营纱厂的恢复生产的过程说明，在政府的扶助下，和经过正确地改善劳资关系后，劳资双方的生产情绪即能提高，生产即能增加，对工人和厂方都有很大利益。目前，各该厂的中心问题也仍是继续贯彻执行劳资两利方针，进一步调整劳资关系，以求更好地发展生产。
