Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th -- The counterfeit silver yuan exchange certificates issued by the Kuomintang bandit remnants in Guangzhou in an attempt to once again plunder the people have been rejected by the people in the areas awaiting liberation. The Kuomintang Central News Agency admitted that in Guangzhou, "no one is willing to use silver yuan notes as a transaction currency." In Xiamen, very few people use silver dollars to exchange for "silver yuan notes" at the "Central Bank." In Guiyang, after the appearance of "silver yuan notes," gold immediately rose by 10%.
