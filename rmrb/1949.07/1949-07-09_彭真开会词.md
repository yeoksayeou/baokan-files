　　Peng Zhen's Opening Speech at Meeting
    [Ping City News] At the North China People's Memorial Meeting for the Twelfth Anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Presidium, delivered an opening speech, the full text of which is as follows: Gentlemen, Comrades:
    Today, people from all walks of life in Beiping City and leaders from all parties, groups, and sectors across the country are holding a meeting in Beiping, at the Lugou Bridge, to commemorate the twelfth anniversary of July 7th. This has significant historical importance.
    Just now there were cannon sounds. Twelve years ago today, there were also cannon sounds, but at that time they were the sounds of the Japanese imperialists' attack. Today, they are the sounds of our celebration of the victory of the People's Liberation War, the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, and the beginning of the establishment of a new people's democratic China.
    Recalling twelve years ago, the Kuomintang reactionaries, disregarding the lives and deaths of the broad masses of people and the loss of vast territories of our motherland, retreated thousands of miles. When the people were extremely saddened and indignant, the Eighth Route Army marched north day and night and achieved the first victory at Pingxingguan, which boosted the morale of the whole country. They advanced all the way to the outskirts of Beiping, to Miaofeng Mountain, Zhaizang, the western Beijing mountains, and the vast enemy rear areas, where they persisted in a long-term struggle and established strong anti-Japanese base areas.
    During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries constantly engaged in capitulation, division, and regression. However, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we victoriously persisted in the war, persisted in unity, and persisted in progress, defeated the reactionaries' conspiracy of splitting and surrendering, and achieved victory in the Anti-Japanese War.
    On August 15th, Japan surrendered, but the surrender was not accepted by the Eighth Route Army, which had contributed to the war, but by the Kuomintang reactionaries, who had retreated thousands of miles after the July 7th Incident and had long been passive in resisting Japan and actively opposing the people. The Kuomintang army, fully equipped with American equipment and hiding in safes during the war, swaggered and triumphantly marched into Beiping. What did they bring to the people of Beiping? They brought confiscation and the "five sons taking the lead"; they brought economic collapse, the rampant behavior of American soldiers in major cities of our country, and the rape of Shen Chong; they brought persecution, hunger, enslavement, and conscription, and they brought a civil war that massacred the people. In short, everything was contrary to the wishes of the Chinese people. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the Chinese people have struggled arduously and relied on the heroic operations of the People's Liberation Army. After three years of liberation war, the Chinese people have achieved a basic victory. Hunger, persecution, and enslavement have disappeared forever with the elimination of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The independent, democratic, and free new China that we have longed for for twelve years is now beginning to be realized. This is a great victory for the Chinese people and a great victory for the people of the world. We must warmly celebrate our victory.
    However, today our enemies have not been completely eliminated. The people of Beiping City must unite with the people of the whole country, make persistent efforts, support the People's Liberation Army, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the remaining forces of the reactionaries, fight to Taiwan, and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive. We must heighten revolutionary vigilance, eliminate hidden spies, and resolutely suppress the sabotage and disruption of reactionary elements. We must cherish our great motherland, protect all the wealth of the motherland, and strive to restore and develop production and prosper the economy of Beiping. We must strive to restore and develop the people's cultural and educational undertakings in Beiping City. We must strive to establish a new people's democratic China, and strive to establish an independent, free, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China.
    Long live the People's Democratic Republic of China!
    Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!
    Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

　　彭真开会词
    【平市讯】北平市各界人民纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年大会上，主席团主席彭真致开会词，全文如下：各位先生，各位同志：
    今天我们北平市各界人民和全国各党派各团体各界的领袖，在北平、在芦沟桥畔来开会纪念七七的第十二周年，是有着重要的历史意义的。
    刚才有炮声，十二年前的今天也有炮声，但是那时是日本帝国主义进攻的炮声，今天却是我们庆祝人民解放战争的胜利，庆祝新政治协商会议筹备会的成立，庆祝人民民主新中国开始建立的炮声。
    回想十二年前，国民党反动派的军队不顾广大人民群众的死活，不顾我们祖国广大领土的沦陷，一退千里，人民悲愤异常的时候，八路军却兼程北上，并且首先在平型关取得了振奋全国人心的胜利，一直挺进到北平近郊，在妙峰山，在斋堂，在平西山地，在广大的敌后，坚持了长期的斗争，建立了强大的抗日根据地。
    在八年抗战期间，国民党反动派总是不断地闹投降、闹分裂、闹倒退，但是我们在毛主席的领导下，却胜利地坚持了抗战，坚持了团结，坚持了进步，打败了反动派分裂投降的阴谋，取得了抗战的胜利。
    八一五日本投降了，但受降的却不是抗战有功的八路军，而是七七事变后，一退千里、长期消极抗日、积极反人民的国民党反动派。用美式装备齐全的，抗战中间钻在保险箱里的国民党军队，耀武扬威神气十足地开进北平了，他们给我们北平人民带来了什么呢？带来的是劫收，带来的是“五子登科”；带来的是经济崩溃，带来的是美军在我国各大城市中的横行霸道和沈崇被强奸；带来的是迫害，饥饿，奴役和征兵，带来的是屠杀人民的内战，总之，无一不和中国人民的愿望相反。现在我们中国人民在中国共产党中央毛主席和朱总司令的领导下，艰苦奋斗，依靠人民解放军的英勇作战，经过三年的解放战争，中国人民已经取得基本的胜利了。饥寒迫害和奴役都随着国民党反动派的被消灭而一去不复返了。我们十二年来渴望着的独立民主自由的新中国，现在开始实现了，这是中国人民的伟大胜利，也是世界人民的伟大胜利，我们要热烈地庆祝我们的胜利。
    但是今天我们的敌人还没有完全被消灭，我们北平市人民要和全国人民团结起来，再接再厉，支援人民解放军，坚决彻底干净全部地歼灭反动派的残余力量，打到台湾去，活捉蒋介石。我们要提高革命的警惕性，肃清暗藏的间谍，坚决镇压反动分子的破坏和捣乱。我们要爱护我们伟大的祖国，保护一切祖国的财富，为恢复与发展生产，繁荣北平的经济而奋斗。为恢复与发展北平市的人民文化教育事业而奋斗。为建立人民民主的新中国而奋斗，为建立独立自由和平统一富强的新中国而奋斗。
    中华人民民主共和国万岁！
    中国人民大团结万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
