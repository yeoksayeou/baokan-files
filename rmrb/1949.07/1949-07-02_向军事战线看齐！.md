　　Emulate the Military Front!
　　Guo Moruo

　　For twelve years, we have mainly relied on the people's armed forces holding guns to defeat the enemy. First, we spent eight years defeating the tyrannical Japanese imperialism, and then we spent three years defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries who were fully supported by American imperialism. Under such circumstances, the army holding pens was only able to have a large-scale gathering in Beiping today. The five major field armies on the cultural front – literary and art workers, natural science workers, social science workers, educators, and journalists – have all decided to convene representative conferences in Ping to expand and consolidate the cultural front in the future. This is an unprecedented grand event, but the responsibilities on the shoulders of the friends participating in this cultural army are indeed becoming heavier.

　　The brilliant military victories have mainly eliminated tangible enemies, but the intangible enemies of feudal ideology for more than two thousand years, comprador ideology for more than a hundred years, and fascist ideology for the past two or thirty years must be completely eliminated by the cultural front. If these intangible enemies are not completely eliminated, the construction of the New Democratic New China will be hindered, and even the brilliant revolutionary military victories will not be easily secured. Therefore, after our great victory on the military front, we must follow it up with a great victory on the cultural front. The army holding pens must emulate the army holding guns!

　　How can we accomplish this mission? This is the main reason why various cultural workers are convening representative conferences. We must all use our minds to discuss specific methods in various positions, and at the same time, we must consider the steps of mutual cooperation, mutual assistance, and mutual supervision between our positions.

　　Revolutionary literary and art workers have always played an active role on the cultural front. And we are very fortunate that Chairman Mao personally gave us very kind and clear "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in May 1942. That classic document is still our rule and guideline today. Today, let's put those instructions into practical work step by step.

　　Although Chairman Mao's "Talks" were instructions from seven years ago, there has been no change in the basic principles. Chairman Mao wants us to stand on the position of the proletariat and the masses of the people and strengthen our political and ideological awareness. Chairman Mao wants us to distinguish between enemies and friends and adopt appropriate attitudes. "All dark forces that endanger the people must be exposed, and all revolutionary struggles of the people must be praised." Chairman Mao wants us to take workers, peasants, and soldiers as our target audience and to "improve on the basis of popularization, and popularize under the guidance of improvement." Chairman Mao wants us to study Marxism-Leninism, to study society, and to grasp that "the objective reality of class struggle and national struggle determines our thoughts and feelings."

　　Under the direct guidance of these valuable basic principles, and under the direct support of the revolutionary regime, literary and art workers in the liberated areas have undoubtedly taken the lead and have indeed made many brilliant achievements. Literary and art workers who have been trapped in the reactionary regime for a long time have been limited by the harsh environment, and have had to take roundabout detours, or have almost never had the opportunity to practice. But precisely because of this, now that we have been liberated, we should catch up quickly and work hard to catch up.

　　Cultural struggle is a long-term and arduous task, which is actually longer and not necessarily easier than military struggle. Let's look at our close ally, the Soviet Union. It has been thirty-two years since the October Revolution, and recently they are still working hard to liquidate formalism in thought and literature and art, and re-proposing the call for realism. This shows that the chronic disease of old ideas is quite stubborn, and people's subjective efforts are really easy to slacken.

　　Accordingly, today, in order to ensure that the victory on the cultural front can cooperate with the military victory, friends in any position and any region should, under the instructions of Chairman Mao, redouble their efforts and not slacken in the slightest. Those who have already taken the lead should not be complacent and self-satisfied, and those who are just starting today should not be discouraged and inferior. The comprehensive liberation of China will soon be realized, and the distinction between the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas will soon become a historical term. Everyone can stand freely under the banner of liberation and be an excellent student of Chairman Mao. Strive to unite ourselves, unite the people, and thoroughly, cleanly, and comprehensively eliminate tangible and intangible enemies, quickly complete the New Democratic New China, and make new contributions to human culture.

### 向军事战线看齐！

　　向军事战线看齐！
    郭沫若
    十二年来我们主要依靠着手里拿枪的人民武力，已经打胜了敌人。我们首先是费了八年工夫打垮了横暴的日本帝国主义，其次是费了三年工夫把美帝国主义所全力支持的国民党反动派打垮了。在这样的情势之下，手里拿笔的军队，在今天才得以大规模地会师北平了。文化上的五大野战军——文学艺术工作者，自然科学工作者，社会科学工作者，教育工作者，新闻工作者，——都先后决定在平召开代表大会，以期扩大并巩固今后的文化战线。这是空前未有的盛事，但在参加这支文化军队的朋友们肩头，责任的确是愈见加重了。
    辉煌的军事胜利，所消灭的主要是有形的敌人，而两千多年来的封建思想，百余年来的买办思想，二三十年来的法西斯思想，这些无形的敌人，还须得文化战线来彻底地加以消灭。这些无形敌人不彻底消灭，新民主主义的新中国的建设是要受着阻挠的，甚至连辉煌的革命的军事胜利都是不容易确保的。因此，我们在军事战线上的伟大胜利之后，还必须继之以文化战线上的伟大胜利，拿笔的军队，必须向拿枪的军队看齐！
    怎样才能完成这项使命呢？这正是各项文化工作者要召集代表大会的主要原因。我们大家要用尽心思来磋商各岗位上的具体办法，而同时也得考虑到彼此岗位之间的相互配合，相互协助，相互督促的步骤。
    革命的文艺工作者，在文化战线上向来是起着积极作用的。而且我们非常幸运，在一九四二年五月，毛主席还亲自“在延安文艺座谈会上”给予了我们以非常亲切而明确的“讲话”。那个经典文献，在今天依然是我们的规矩准绳。我们今天就请把那些指示，切实地逐步移到工作实践上去吧。
    毛主席的“讲话”虽然是七年前的指示，但在基本原则上并没有什么改变。毛主席要我们站在无产阶级和人民大众的立场，加强我们的政治性和思想性。毛主席要我们分清敌友，采取适应的态度，“一切危害人民群众的黑暗势力必须暴露之，一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之”。毛主席要我们以工农兵为对象，要“在普及基础上提高，在提高指导下普及”。毛主席要我们学习马列主义，学习社会，要我们掌握着“阶级斗争和民族斗争的客观现实决定我们的思想感情”。
    在这些宝贵的基本原则的直接指导之下，在革命政权的直接的扶掖之下，解放区的文艺工作者，无疑是走上前头去了，的确有了不少的辉煌的成就。长久陷没在反动政权下的文艺工作者们便为恶劣环境所限制，只好迂回曲折地走着冤路，或则差不多一直没有得到实践的机会。但唯其这样，在今天已经得到解放了，我们正应该急起直追，努力地赶上前去。
    文化斗争是一项长远的坚苦的工作，实际上要比军事斗争还得长久，而且不一定更轻松。我们请看我们亲密的盟邦苏联吧。十月革命以来已经三十二年了，最近在思想和文艺上都还在努力作形式主义的清算，而重新提出现实主义的号召。足见旧思想的慢性痼疾实在相当顽固，而人们的主观努力也实在是容易松懈的。
    准此，我们在今天，为了使文化战线上的胜利能够和军事胜利配合，无论任何岗位，任何区域的朋友，都应该在毛主席的指示之下，加倍的努力，丝毫也不要懈怠。已经走在前头的，不要自骄自满，从今天起才开步走的，也不要气馁自卑。中国的全面解放很快就要实现了，解放区与国统区的分别很快就要成为历史上的名辞，大家都自由自在地站在解放的旗帜之下，做一个毛主席的优秀的学生吧。努力团结自己，团结人民，向有形无形的敌人加以彻底干净全面的扫荡，把新民主主义的新中国迅速完成，并对于人类文化作出新的贡献。
    一九四九年六月二十五日
