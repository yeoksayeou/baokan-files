According to statistics from the Jianghan Customs Trade Office, the total value of goods shipped from Shanghai to Wuhan in June and the first ten days of July was over 2.5 billion RMB, with cotton yarn and cloth accounting for the largest proportion, over 46% of the total value. The total value of goods shipped from Wuhan to Shanghai was over 1.6 billion RMB, with cotton accounting for over 86%. In order to promote trade between the two regions, the Central China Trading Company has sent personnel to Shanghai to establish a resident office.

The Trust Company under the Wuhan Municipal Trading Company also started business on July 13. The company accepts commissions from public and private merchants to buy and sell goods, charging only 1% handling fee, and provides free services for non-business commissions.

　　武汉贸易逐渐恢复
  　由沪换回大量棉纱布匹
    【新华社汉口二十日电】武汉与上海及湖北内地的贸易逐渐恢复与发展中。据江汉关贸易处统计，六月份和七月上旬，由沪输汉的货物总值为人民币二十五亿余元，以棉纱布匹类占第一位，占总值的百分之四十六强；由汉输沪的货物总值为十六亿余元，其中棉花占百分之八十六强。为推进两地贸易，华中贸易公司已派员赴上海设驻沪办事处。湖北省贸易公司并已在黄岗、孝感、襄樊、江陵、宜昌、沔阳、大冶等分区设立了贸易分公司，在一些重要县城和市镇建立了三十一个公营商店，构成以武汉为中心的国营商业网，以沟通武汉与内地的贸易，交流城乡物资。最近湖北省贸易公司曾由华中贸易总公司拨来大批食盐、煤、油、洋布等分发各地，各地商店收购之土产，如钟祥、沔阳等地的棉花，襄樊、随县等地的粮食、桐油，沔阳等地的土布、皮油，则正源源运供武汉市场。武汉市贸易公司所辖之信托公司亦已于七月十三日开始营业。该公司承受公私客商委托买卖货物，仅收手续费百分之一，对非营业性质的委托并予免费服务。这给予各机关部队的采购与各地农民的托售粮棉等，极大便利。
    又：上月十六日开业之汉口交通银行，业务已有迅速开展。截至七月十三日，该行吸收之私营企业与市民的存款已达六亿七千余万元，存款结余额二亿五千余万元，折实储蓄达七千多个实物单位，对公私企业贷放款为一亿三千余万元及十四万个实物单位。该行为公营企业如电信局等代收款项亦日渐增加。该行与各埠的汇兑业务亦在扩展中。
