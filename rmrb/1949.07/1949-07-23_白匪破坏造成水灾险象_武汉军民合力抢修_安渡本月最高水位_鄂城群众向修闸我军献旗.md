Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 22nd: The first phase of flood control work in the Wuhan area along the Yangtze and Han Rivers has safely passed the highest water level of the first half of this month, thanks to the full efforts of the people under the leadership of Party, government, and military leadership. Since the beginning of summer, the water level of the Yangtze River has risen frequently. The dikes along the Jianghan area are fraught with danger due to the serious damage caused by the White Chongxi bandit troops. When fleeing, the White bandits, in order to create floods and prevent the southward advance of the People's Liberation Army, ordered that all sluice gates along the Jianghan River should not be closed, causing river water to flow into lakes and ditches in various places. Therefore, when the Yangtze River water rose in the summer, the lakes could not store water and instead poured back into the river. At the same time, the White bandits dug trenches and built fortifications everywhere on the dikes near Wuhan, making the long-neglected dikes dilapidated. For example, the Zhanggong Dike, which closely protects the northwest of Hankou City, was dug up with 12,000 cubic meters of soil, and the Han Yang Lan River Dike was dug up in four places, totaling more than 120 meters. After the People's Liberation Army liberated the Wuhan area in mid-May, in order to protect the lives and property of the vast number of residents along the river, the Wuhan Military Control Commission immediately supervised its subordinate organs to carry out flood control work in a planned and focused manner. At the same time, the Wuhan Flood Control Committee was formed, with Mayor Wu Defeng concurrently serving as the director in charge. The Jianghan Special Commissioner's Offices along the river outside Wuhan also established water conservancy bureaus. In late May, after the river water rose sharply, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government immediately dispatched the Jianghan Engineering Bureau and its eight flood control engineering sections and more than 20 water level measuring stations to various dangerous locations to strengthen flood control work. The Water Conservancy Management Office of the Military Control Commission also dispatched a large number of cadres to rush to Wuchang, Daye and other places to assist in the rescue. In the urban area of Wuhan, the main tasks were to repair the Zhanggong Dike and the Wutai Sluice in the southeast of Wuchang. The Zhanggong Dike was originally 29.29 meters high and 22 kilometers long, with the urban area inside the dike. The restoration project of this dike was extremely arduous due to the severe damage, but it was completed ahead of schedule on June 24 with the joint efforts of the military and civilians. The Wutai Sluice was also completed ahead of schedule under the competition between the military and civilians. In addition, in order to reduce the accumulated water in the Houhu Lake (the suburbs inside the Zhanggong Dike), the Wuhan Municipal Construction Bureau specially installed six water pumps on the lakeside, each capable of draining 1.25 million gallons per hour, to speed up drainage. Twenty-five water pumps were also installed in Hankou City to drain the accumulated water in the sewers. During the repair and prevention, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government successively allocated a total of 42.54 million yuan for flood control, 260,000 burlap bags and more than 10,000 jin of iron wire and other materials. The Municipal Garrison Command also transferred three battalions of troops to assist in the protection. In Echeng and Mianyang areas outside Wuhan, repair work was also actively carried out. The danger section of the Minsin Sluice in Fankou, Echeng, was more than 120 meters long. It was completely completed by the local residents and more than 800 stationed troops by the end of June. Due to the continued rise of the river water, four gate panels were washed away again. After the local military and civilians rescued it day and night, it was saved on the 16th. Due to the rise of the river water, a breach occurred on the 30-foot-wide dike of the New Dike in Mianyang County on the 12th of this month. The Mianyang Special Commissioner's Office and the local county and district governments are currently rescuing on the one hand and mobilizing the masses to fully dredge on the other. The people in various places were extremely moved by the active leadership of the people's government in repairing the dikes, especially the vigorous assistance of the People's Liberation Army soldiers. When the Minsin Sluice in Echeng was completed, more than 3,000 people gathered to celebrate and pay tribute to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army that assisted in the repair of the闸.

　　白匪破坏造成水灾险象
  　武汉军民合力抢修
  　安渡本月最高水位
    鄂城群众向修闸我军献旗
    【新华社汉口二十二日电】武汉地区长江及汉水两岸第一期防汛工作，一个半月来，在党政军领导机关率领各地人民全力努力下，已安然渡过本月上中旬的最高水位。入夏以来，长江水位频频上涨。江汉一带堤岸，因遭白崇禧匪部严重破坏，险象环生。白匪于逃跑时为制造水灾，阻止解放军南进，曾命令江汉沿岸一律不准关闭水闸，致使江水流灌各地湖泊沟渠。因此，入夏长江水涨，湖内既不能蓄水，反向江内倒灌。同时，白匪又在武汉附近堤坝上到处挖掘战壕、建筑堡垒，使年久失修的堤岸破毁不堪。如紧护汉口市西北的张公堤，即被挖毁一万二千方土，汉阳拦江大堤亦被挖毁四处，共一百二十余公尺。五月中旬解放军解放武汉地区后，为了保护沿江广大居民的生命财产，武汉军管会立即督令所属机关，有计划、有重点地进行防汛工作。同时组成武汉防汛委员会，由市长吴德峰兼任主任亲自主持。武汉外围沿江各专署亦成立了水利局。五月下旬，江水猛涨后，武汉地区人民政府当即派遣江汉工程局及其所属八个防汛工务段和二十余个水位测量站，分赴各险要处加强防汛工作。军管会水利管理处亦派遣大批干部，赶赴武昌，大冶等地协助抢救。在武汉市区主要是抢修张公堤和武昌东南的武泰闸等工程。张公堤原高二九·二九公尺，长二十二公里，堤内即为市区。该堤因被破坏惨重，修复工程极为艰巨，但在军民合力抢修下，于六月二十四日提前完成。武泰闸亦在军民竞赛下提早修竣。此外，武汉市建设局为减少后湖（张公堤内之市郊）积水，特于湖边装置六架每小时能排水一百二十五万加仑的抽水机，加紧排水。汉口市内亦装有二十五架抽水机，以排疏阴沟积水。在修防中，武汉市人民政府先后共拨发防汛经费四千二百五十四万元，麻袋二十六万条及铁丝等器材一万余斤。市警备司令部并调三个营的部队协助防护。在武汉外围鄂城及沔阳一带，亦积极展开抢修工作。鄂城樊口民新闸险工长达一百二十余公尺，经当地居民及驻军八百余人抢修，六月底曾全部完工，因江水续涨，又冲毁闸板四块，复经当地军民星夜抢救，于十六日脱险。沔阳县新堤因江水上涨，本月十二日在三十丈宽的堤面上漫水造成决口，沔阳专署及当地县区政府现正一面抢救，一面动员群众全力疏导中。各地群众对人民政府积极领导修堤，特别是解放军战士的奋力协助，极为感动。鄂城民新闸完工时，三千余群众特集会庆祝，并向协助修闸之解放军某部旗致敬。
