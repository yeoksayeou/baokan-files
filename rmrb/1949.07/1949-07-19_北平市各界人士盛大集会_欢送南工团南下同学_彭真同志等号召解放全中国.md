    Comrade Peng Zhen and Others Call for the Liberation of All of China

More than 6,000 students from the Southern Work Group in Beiping, dressed in green military uniforms, were in high spirits and cheerful.
    The conference began at 7:30 PM, and a presidium of seventeen people, including Peng Zhen and Ye Jianying, was approved. Comrade Peng Zhen first congratulated the comrades of the Southern Work Group for learning in a few months the achievements that the Chinese people had only learned in over a hundred years, celebrating the success of their studies, and sending them south to complete the liberation of Southern China, that is, all of China. He encouraged everyone to prepare for hardship, be determined to overcome various difficulties, adhere to the position of wholeheartedly serving the people, closely connect with the masses, and study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to action. Democratic professor Zhang Xiruo hoped that the students would put what they have learned into practice, and learn again in practice, so that learning and eternal practice can be combined to make substantial progress.
    Mayor Ye introduced the experiences of Beiping's work over the past few months to the comrades of the Southern Work Group, urging them to grasp the characteristics of urban concentration, approach the masses more directly, investigate and research, think more, and discover what are the large and universal things, as the center of work, grasp the central link, and after completion, victoriously switch to another center. Finally, Mayor Ye encouraged everyone to learn sincerely and respectfully from all kinds of working people. In work, we must not be careless, but be neither arrogant nor impatient, be humble and cautious, regard the people's liberation cause as a solemn cause, truly be responsible to the people, and complete the southward mission from beginning to end. Wu Han, a representative of the China Democratic League, hoped that the students would combine theory with practice, promote truth, and complete the revolution. Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, hoped that the comrades of the Southern Work Group would become conscious fighters serving the workers and peasants. After speeches by Xu Liqun, representative of the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Youth League, Zhang Dacheng, representative of the young workers, and representatives of the Beiping Municipal female students, Lin Yishan, the responsible comrade of the Southward Work Group, explained that under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in striving for, uniting, and transforming intellectuals, the Southern Work Group has basically completed the education plan. He encouraged all students to use action to repay the warm send-off from all walks of life in Beiping.
    Zhou Decheng, a member of the Southern Work Group, representing all members, guaranteed that he would strive to complete the glorious historical task of liberating the 200 million compatriots in Jiangnan. Qian Xuexi, a professor at Peking University, and Ms. Liu Shuyu, representatives of the family members, expressed that they felt extremely happy and honored to have such children. They encouraged the children of the Southern Work Group to resolutely and bravely go south, believing that the revolutionary family would train them to be more useful than in the family.
    Then, the Central Committee of the Youth League, the Beiping Municipal People's Circles Send-off Conference for the Southward Work Group, Hua Bei University, and Hebei Female Vocational School presented flags to the Southern Work Group amidst thunderous applause from the audience, and there were dance, Yangge, and other programs and fireworks to add to the excitement.
