Column: Questions and Answers

To the Editor:

While studying Chapter 6 of "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," "Should Revolutionaries Work in Reactionary Trade Unions?", we have discussed the following question for a long time but cannot figure it out. Please provide an answer.

"…and then through these production trade unions, it is possible to eliminate the division of labor between people, to educate, train, and cultivate people who are knowledgeable in all aspects and trained in all aspects, people who can do everything. Communism is moving in this direction, it must move in this direction, and it will definitely reach it, but it will take many years…"

With the progress of society, people's knowledge in various aspects will gradually become richer, and it will not be as narrow and impoverished as it is today. We believe this aspect should be affirmed, but based on the development laws of social sciences and natural sciences, the division of labor between people will become more clear and more specialized in the future. The division of labor cannot be eliminated, and there will never be anyone who can do everything, even after many years.

I don't know if the above view is wrong.

Comrade Gao Jie:

Your letter has been received, and the answers to the questions raised are as follows:

When Lenin said in Chapter 6 of "Left-Wing Communism" that the division of labor between people can be eliminated through trade unions, he was referring to the division of labor in the past, the division of labor between mental and physical labor. What is to be eliminated is the class monopoly of intellectual labor. But this does not mean that specialization will not exist. In the future advanced society, every member of society has the possibility of improving their cultural level, and should have a high level of intellectual development, and also have the possibility of choosing a profession according to their talents, and should also be proficient in a specialized business. In the new democratic society, although there are not yet the conditions of a future advanced society, this possibility and necessity already exists. For example, in addition to professional studies in various agencies, groups, and departments, we also have political, current affairs, and theoretical studies. The People's Liberation Army has knowledge in military, political, economic, cultural, and other aspects, with military affairs as its specialty. This means that the new society on the one hand eliminates the division of labor of the old society, and at the same time, under new circumstances and new conditions, members of society can and need to have knowledge and skills in various aspects, and also generate new divisions of labor and new specialties.

### 答人与人间的分工问题

专栏：设问与答复

　　答人与人间的分工问题编者同志：
    学习“左派幼稚病第六章革命家应否在反动工会内进行工作呢？”时，下述问题我们讨论好久，搞不清，请予解答。
    “……然后经过这些生产工会，可以去消灭人与人中间的分工，可以去教育、训练和培养各方面都有知识的、各方面都有训练的人，会作一切事情的人。共产主义正是向这个方向走的，它必须向这个方向走，并且定能走到，不过要经过长久的年月的。……”
    随着社会的进步，人们对各方面的知识会逐渐丰富起来的，不会象今天这样狭隘贫困的。我们认为这方面是应该肯定的，但是根据社会科学、自然科学的发展规律来看，今后人与人中间的分工会更明确，更专门化起来。分工是不可能消灭的，会作一切事情的人更不会有的，即使经过长久的年月。
    以上观点不知是否有错误。敬礼    华北医大研究室高皆
  　四月二十四日高皆同志：
    来信收到，所提问题答复如下：
    列宁在“左派幼稚病”第六章中所说经过工会可以消灭人与人间的分工，是指过去的分工，为智力劳动与体力劳动的分工，所要消灭的是智力劳动的阶级独占。但这不是说专业化不存在，到将来高级的社会，每个社会成员有提高自己文化水平的可能，并应该具有高度的智力发达水平，也有按自己才能选择职业的可能，并且也要精通一种专门业务。在新民主主义社会内，虽然还没有将来高级社会那样的条件，但这种可能和必要已经有了，如各机关、团体、部门业务学习之外，我们还有政治、时事、理论等学习，人民解放军有军事、政治、经济、文化等各方面的知识，而以军事为专业，这就是说：新社会一方面消灭旧社会的分工，同时，在新的情况，新的条件之下，社会成员可以有并需要有各方面的知识与才能，并且又产生新的分工，有新的专业。
