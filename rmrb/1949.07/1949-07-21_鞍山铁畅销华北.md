　　Anshan Iron Sells Well in North China
　　[Report from this newspaper] Iron produced in Anshan, Northeast China, is selling well in North China, partially solving the raw material problem for North China's iron industry. The Pingjin Coal and Iron Company has been continuously purchasing and transporting large quantities of pig iron and raw iron from Anshan to supply raw materials for the development of production in iron factories and machine factories in Pingjin and other cities in North China. Even the Production Promotion Cooperative in southern Hebei came to Tianjin to purchase iron. The first batch of 30 tons of iron transported to Ping City by the Beiping Coal and Iron Branch Company through its Tianjin-based head office was sold out in just one day. The Production Promotion Cooperatives of Dingxing and Xushui also purchased four tons. On the 18th and 19th of this month, another 90 tons of pig iron were transported, and various iron factories have been actively purchasing it for the past two days, resulting in a feeling of insufficient supply. The branch company has now continued to purchase another 200 tons from the head office, which will be transported to Ping soon.

　　鞍山铁畅销华北
    【本报讯】东北鞍山产铁在华北畅销，部分解决了华北铁工业的原料问题。平津煤铁公司已陆续由鞍山购运大批生铁元铁等，以供给平津及华北各城市铁工厂、机器厂发展生产的原料。远至冀南之生产推进社，都到天津来购铁。北平煤铁分公司经由在天津的总公司运到平市的第一批铁三十吨，仅一日即售罄，定兴、徐水的生产推进社也购走了四吨。本月十八、十九两日又运到生铁九十吨，两日来各铁工厂纷纷购买，故有供不应求之感。现该分公司又续在总公司批购二百吨，不日即可运平。
