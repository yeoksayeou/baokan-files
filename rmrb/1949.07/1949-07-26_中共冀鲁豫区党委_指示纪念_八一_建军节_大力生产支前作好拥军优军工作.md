　　[Jilu Yu Electric] The CCP Jilu Yu District Committee, in order to commemorate the "August 1st" Army Day of the People's Liberation Army, issued instructions a few days ago. The instructions, after elaborating on the important significance of "August 1st," pointed out: In order to commemorate this great Army Day with practical actions, it calls on Party committees, governments, and organizations at all levels to deeply publicize the fighting history of the People's Liberation Army and its great contributions and immortal achievements in the cause of people's liberation. In particular, it is necessary to combine the suffering of the people in Jilu Yu during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan and the three years of the War of Liberation from enemy devastation, and the profound friendship and flesh-and-blood relationship between the army and the people established in the joint battles with the People's Liberation Army. Make the masses understand more clearly that without the People's Liberation Army, there would be no peaceful and stable life today. At the same time, we must recognize that before the imperialist system and class are completely eliminated, we cannot weaken our people's armed forces in the slightest. We must overcome the paralysis tendency caused by peace and the danger of neglecting the armed forces that may arise. We must vigorously promote production to support the front and do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families, especially focusing on the solution of the problem of land tilling on behalf of military families, and striving to truly improve the production of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. On the basis of doing a good job in giving preferential treatment to military families, we must strengthen education for families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, commend model military families, and encourage them to write letters to encourage soldiers on the front line, so that they can concentrate on killing the enemy. The "One Letter Movement" initiated by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation should be well implemented and launched. We must write letters to the officers and soldiers at the front to express our congratulations and respect, relieve them of all concerns about their families, and encourage morale to make persistent efforts, advance bravely, completely eliminate the Kuomintang's reactionary remnants, and strive for the liberation of the people of the whole country!

    大力生产支前作好拥军优军工作
    【冀鲁豫电】中共冀鲁豫区党委，为纪念“八一”人民解放军建军节日，特于日前发出指示。指示在阐述了“八一”的重要意义后，继即指出：为了以实际行动来纪念这一伟大的建军节日，号召各级党委、政府、团体要深入宣扬人民解放军的奋斗历史，及其在人民解放事业上的伟大贡献与不朽功绩。特别要结合冀鲁豫八年抗战，三年解放战争中，人民所受敌人的摧残痛苦和与人民解放军并肩作战中所建立的深情厚谊、军民间的血肉关系。使群众更明了没有解放军就没有今天和平安定的生活。同时必须认识在帝国主义制度与阶级未彻底消灭前，丝毫不能减弱我们人民的武装力量，要克服因和平而产生的麻痹倾向与可能产生忽视武装力量的危险。要大力生产支前，做好拥军优军工作，特别着重于代耕问题的解决，求得烈属军属的生产确实的提高一步。在做好优军工作基础上，加强对烈属军属教育，表扬模范军属，鼓励其写信激励前线战士，使之安心杀敌。全国民主妇联所发起的“一封信运动”，应很好贯彻发动。要向前方将士写信致贺致敬，解除他们对家庭的各种顾虑，鼓励士气再接再厉，勇猛进军，彻底消灭国民党的反动残余力量，争取全国人民的解放！
