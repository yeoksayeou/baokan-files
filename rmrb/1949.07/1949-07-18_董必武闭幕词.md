    (Ping City News) The full text of Dong Biwu's closing speech at the preparatory meeting of the All-China Federation of Social Science Workers' Representatives is as follows:

    Although our meeting only lasted for three days, these three days have prominently displayed some admirable characteristics. What are these characteristics?

    First, I would like to point out that this meeting demonstrates a spirit of unity. It is no secret that not all participants in this meeting previously agreed on academic ideas. But now we can all unite, and we will form a broader unity through the convening of the All-China Federation of Social Science Workers' Representatives. This is an excellent thing. Why can we unite? Because we are all willing to work for the construction of a new democratic New China, so we can unite. And because we all recognize Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as scientific truths, we can unite more firmly. Some people embarked on the path of truth earlier, some later, some ahead, and some behind, but in any case, we all want to move towards the direction of truth. Only under the guidance of the truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can our social science work truly contribute to the construction of New China. We are united on the basis of truth, so this unity is extremely meaningful.

    Secondly, I would like to point out that this meeting also demonstrates a spirit of learning. We have seen that many friends, who in the past took many detours in their pursuit of truth, even mistaking falsehood for truth, now have a renewed enthusiasm for learning. Many friends who accepted the truth of Marxism-Leninism earlier also keenly feel their own shortcomings and want to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in connection with reality. This is undoubtedly also an excellent thing. Conceit and complacency are enemies of science, and therefore enemies of Marxism-Leninism. Science is developing, and so is Marxism-Leninism. If scientists are complacent, they will block the path of scientific development. Moreover, scientific development may encounter some difficulties. Once scientists become complacent, they will either ignore or avoid these difficulties, and ultimately the difficulties cannot be overcome. Their work will then stop at the level they have reached and cannot be improved any further. Marx said it well: "In science, there is no smooth road to travel; only those who are not afraid of hardship in climbing have the hope of reaching the glorious peak." Chairman Mao is a model of being most willing to learn with humility. If we can all maintain the spirit of continuous learning, this will guarantee that our social science work will flourish day by day.

    Comrades, friends, there is indeed countless work to be done before us. We must constantly introduce the new achievements of international Marxist-Leninist research, especially the research achievements of the Soviet Union. We must also, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, properly summarize the experiences of the Chinese revolutionary struggle from all aspects, in order to enrich Marxist-Leninist theory. We must raise the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism in China to the proper height, and we must also work hard to popularize the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism widely among the people. We must seriously study many problems in Chinese history that have not yet been carefully studied. At the same time, we must also continuously engage in research based on the new phenomena in the socio-political sphere that are developing and progressing every day. The new Political Consultative Conference is about to be held, and large-scale national construction is about to begin. To establish a new democratic state system, to develop production and construction and cultural and educational undertakings, and to build a strong national defense for the Chinese people, all require the help of social sciences. As long as we can study hard according to the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and unite all social science workers to study together, we will certainly be able to do all this work well.

    Our preparatory meeting has successfully concluded. Let us wish the All-China Federation of Social Science Workers' Representatives a success, let us wish the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism a more prosperous development in China, and let us wish the construction of New China a victory.

    董必武闭幕词
    【平市讯】董必武在中华全国社会科学工作者代表会议筹备会上的闭幕词，全文如下：
    我们的这个会议虽然只开了三天，但在这三天的会议中是很显著的表现着一些值得赞美的特点。这些是什么特点呢？
    首先，我想指出，在这次会议中，表现着团结的精神。毋庸讳言，这个会议的参加者，在以前并不是都能在学术思想上同声相应的。但现在我们都能团结在一起了，并且我们将通过全国社会科学工作者代表会议的召开而形成更广大的团结。这是极好的事情。为什么我们能团结起来呢？因为我们都愿意为新民主主义新中国的建设事业而工作，所以我们就能团结起来。并且因为我们都承认马列主义和毛泽东思想是科学的真理，所以我们就能团结得更巩固。有的人早走上了真理的道路，有的人迟一点，有的人走在前，有的人走在后，但不管怎样，我们都是想朝着真理的方向走去的。也只有在马列主义和毛泽东思想的真理指导下，我们的社会科学工作才真正能有助于新中国的建设事业。我们是团结在真理的基础上，所以，这团结是极有意义的。
    其次，我想指出，在这次会议中又表现着学习的精神。我们看到，有许多朋友，过去在追求真理的路上走过许多弯路，甚至把虚伪的充当作真理，现在是有了重新学习的热诚。许多较早接受马列主义真理的朋友现在也痛感到自己的不足，要和实际相联系着来加强马列主义与毛泽东思想的学习。这无疑的也是极好的事情。虚骄自满是科学的敌人，也就是马列主义的敌人。科学是发展的，马列主义也是发展的。科学工作者自满，便阻塞了科学发展的门路。而且科学发展中还可能遇到若干困难，科学工作者一经自满，遇到困难，不是忽视它，便是逃避它，困难终于无法克服，自己的工作也就停止在原来到达的水平，不能再提高一寸了。马克思说得好：“在科学上面是没有平坦的大路可走的，只有那在攀登上不怕吃苦的人，才有希望攀到光辉的顶点。”毛主席就是一个最肯虚心学习的模范。我们大家都能保持不断学习的精神，这就可以保障我们的社会科学工作一天天发扬广大。
    同志们，朋友们，在我们面前的确有无数的工作要做。我们要把国际间马列主义研究的新的成果，首先是苏联的研究成果，不断地介绍进来，还要把中国革命斗争的经验，在毛泽东思想指导下，从各方面好好地总结出来，以丰富马列主义的理论。我们要使马列主义的理论水平在中国提高到应有的高度，我们更要努力做普及工作把马列主义的基本知识广泛地在人民中传播。我们要认真研究在中国历史中的许多尚未经仔细研究的问题，同时我们也要根据每天在发展进行着的社会政治中的新的现象不断地从事研究。新政治协商会议即将举行，大规模的国家建设事业已在开始。要建立新民主主义的国家制度，要开展生产建设事业和文化教育事业，要建设中国人民的强大国防，都必须社会科学的帮助。只要我们能按照马列主义和毛泽东思想的指导好好地学习，并且团结所有的社会科学工作者一起来学习，我们就一定能做好这一切工作。
    我们的这一次筹备会议是成功的闭幕了。让我们来预祝中华全国社会科学工作者代表会议的成功，让我们来预祝马列主义的科学理论在中国更加繁荣发展，让我们来预祝新中国建设事业的胜利。
