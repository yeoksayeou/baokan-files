　　People's Bank of Xuanhua Branch
    Absorbs Idle Capital to Support Industry and Commerce
  　Achievements in Deposit, Loan, and Remittance Services
    [Xuanhua News] In June, the Xuanhua Branch of the People's Bank, in order to vigorously absorb idle capital, provide loans, develop production, and support industry and commerce, absorbed a total of 87,136,990 yuan (RMB, same below) in deposits from public enterprises and 21,334,857 yuan in deposits from private industrial and commercial enterprises. The number of deposit accounts increased from 234 to 385. The general merchants and masses felt that the bank was truly beneficial to them, with convenient deposits and withdrawals. Therefore, some women and children also came to the bank with their passbooks to deposit and withdraw money, and some households deposited and withdrew two or three times a day.

    During the entire month, loans were issued to 289 industrial and commercial households, totaling 57,464,557 yuan. The bank also adopted four methods: order-based loans, real-value loans, discounted loans, and currency loans. These included two public industrial and mining enterprises, three cooperatives, 177 private industrial enterprises (including felt hat, fur, and flour milling industries), 99 private commercial enterprises, six public current account overdrafts, and two rural sideline businesses. Real-value loans to private industries included 17 fur businesses, three flour milling businesses, one printing business, and 19 felt hat businesses, totaling 40 households, with a total loan amount of 8,040,704 yuan. Order-based loans included 12 hemp paper businesses and 13 felt hat businesses, totaling 8,267,892 yuan in loan value. After the loans were issued, the bank conducted internal inspections. The bank's order-based loans and currency loans played a significant role in solving the capital shortage and sales problems of several industries. For example, due to the correct implementation of the Party's urban industrial and commercial policy, the concerns of industrial and commercial households were alleviated. By the end of the month, the total number of industrial and commercial households in the city (excluding small vendors) had increased to 1,034, an increase of 294 households compared to May. The remittance business increased by 100% compared to May, with a total of 66 remittances sent out, amounting to 9,677,950 yuan, and a total of 14 remittances received, amounting to 178,396 yuan. The most frequent destinations for remittances were still Beiping, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou, followed by Datong and Yuxian.

    Last month, the total amount of gold and silver collected was 369 silver dollars, 2,013 taels of silver, and 4.5 taels of gold. In order to unify currency and facilitate transactions, the branch redeemed a large amount of Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region currency, Beihai currency, Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region currency (with "Ji-Re-Liao" characters), Xilong currency, and Jinan currency in June. Now, the Renminbi circulating in the Xuanhua market accounts for more than 90%, and other old currencies are about to disappear. (Xuanhua Branch Correspondent Group)

　　人民银行宣化支行
    吸收游资扶植工商业
  　存款放款汇兑业务均获成绩
    【宣化讯】人民银行宣化支行六月份为大力吸收游资，举办放款，发展生产扶植工商业，共吸收公营企业存款八七、一三六、九九○元，（人民币下同）私营工商业存款二一、三三四、八五七元，存款户由二三四户，增到了三八五户，一般商户群众感到银行对自己真有好处，存取方便，所以有的妇女儿童也到银行持折存取，并有的户一天内存二三次。
    全月份工商户放款二八九户，款额五七、四六四、五五七元，银行并采用了订货贷款、折实贷款、折价贷款，货币贷款等四种方式，其中包括公营工矿业二户，合作社三户，私营工业一七七户（包括毡帽、皮毛、制粉等业），私营商业九九户，公营活存透支六户及农村副业二户，私营工业折实贷款，计有毛皮业十七户，制粉业三户，印刷业一户，毡帽业十九户，共计四十户，贷款总额八、○四○、七○四元。订货贷款计有麻纸业十二户，毡帽业十三户，计折款八、二六七、八九二元。贷款后经过行内检查，若干行业的资金短少与销路问题的解决，银行的订货贷款与货币贷款是起了很大作用的。例如：由于正确的贯彻了党的城市工商政策，解除了工商户的顾虑，至月底全市工商户（小摊贩除外）已增到一、○三四户，较五月份增二九四户。汇兑业务较五月份汇款金额增加一倍，共汇出六六笔，金额九、六七七、九五○元，共汇入十四笔，金额一七八、三九六元，汇出地点仍以北平、天津、张家口为多，大同、蔚县次之。
    收兑金银上月共收兑银元三六九元，白银二、○一三两，黄金四·五两。为了统一货币便利交易，六月份支行曾兑回大量晋察冀边币、北海币、晋察冀边币（旁带冀热辽字者）、西农币、冀南币。现在宣化市面流通之人民币已占百分之九十以上，其他旧币即将绝迹。（宣化支行通讯小组）
