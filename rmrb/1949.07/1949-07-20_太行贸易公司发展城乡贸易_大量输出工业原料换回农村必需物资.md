The Taihang Trading Branch Company recently summarized its work for the first half of the year, considering that it has achieved significant results in connecting urban and rural trade, facilitating the exchange of industrial and agricultural products, supporting mass production, and aiding the war effort. 1. In terms of organizing the exchange of industrial and agricultural products: It absorbed industrial raw materials and supplied them to cities such as Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, including a total of 6.85 million jin of cotton, 270,000 jin of edible oil, 450,000 jin of hemp skin, 120,000 jin of wool, and approximately 100,000 jin of sulfur. In the absorption work, attention was paid to supporting the planting of industrial raw material crops and appropriately increasing prices. For example, Anyang and Xinxiang increased the price of cotton from exchanging six jin of rice per jin of cotton to exchanging eight jin of rice, helping farmers solve the difficulties of fertilizer and seeds. The Xinxiang branch company statistics: Supplied the masses with 110,000 jin of peanut seeds. To protect crops, the district company purchased 5,000 jin of insecticide (red alum) from other districts. The necessities transferred from cities to rural areas include: 110,000 bolts of wide cloth, 29,400 bundles of cotton yarn, 80,000 packages of matches, 1.14 million jin of kerosene, and 10,000 reams of paper (other items not included), with a total value of over 300 million RMB. 2. Organized the export of mountain goods and local medicinal materials totaling more than 500,000 jin, in exchange for Sichuan and Guangdong medicinal materials and other materials needed in our district. The Handan Medicinal Materials Station alone exchanged for more than 60,000 jin of Sichuan and Guangdong medicinal materials. 3. Vigorously assisted the masses in disaster areas to produce and overcome famine. Absorbed 15 million square feet of homespun cloth in disaster areas. A large amount of grain was transferred to disaster areas, totaling 46.34 million jin of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains. In the material turnover, organized the transportation of the masses in the disaster areas, and the calculable payment of porterage alone reached 89.31 million yuan, equivalent to 3.57 million jin of millet. 4. Stabilized prices and supplied neighboring areas. In order to stabilize prices, 13 million jin of grain were transferred in January and February, supplying approximately 1.27 million jin to industrial and mining workers. At the same time, actively supplied grain to neighboring areas, including 3.8 million jin to Shijiazhuang, 1 million jin to Yangquan, 500,000 jin to Handan, and 400,000 jin to the disaster area in southern Hebei, totaling 5.7 million jin, which played a significant role in stabilizing prices in neighboring areas. In the past four months, a total of more than 10 million jin of edible salt has been transferred, solving more than 60% of the needs of the entire region and ensuring price stability. 5. Timely supplied the material needs of the battlefield. During the battles to liberate Xinxiang and Anyang, the trading company participated in the logistics station work, organizing a large number of materials to sell to the army at low prices, including 190,000 jin of edible salt, 140,000 jin of edible oil, and 70,000 jin of vermicelli, stabilizing battlefield prices and reducing the exploitation of the army by merchants.
