Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 14th—Reports from various sources: After bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek flew to Baguio, the summer capital of the Philippines, he held three consecutive secret meetings with Philippine President Quirino on the 10th and 11th. After the so-called joint statement was announced on the evening of the 11th, Chiang Kai-shek flew back to his bandit nest in Taipei by plane on the morning of the 12th. According to a United Press Manila dispatch on the 11th, the Chiang-Quirino joint statement first declared: "The two countries should immediately take concrete and practical steps to promote closer economic and cultural cooperation." However, everyone knows that neither Chiang Kai-shek nor Quirino, these two thugs, can help each other economically. Therefore, the same United Press dispatch also stated: "Diplomatic sources pointed out that neither China (Kuomintang) nor the Philippines has any interests of practical value to offer each other. To say that the Philippines can provide China with economic assistance is too imaginative, as the Philippines itself is in dire need of economic assistance."

The main part of the Chiang-Quirino joint statement is to advocate for a so-called alliance of Far Eastern countries "to immediately form an alliance to help each other resist and eliminate the threat of communism." The statement suggested that "all countries willing to join this alliance should immediately send plenipotentiary representatives to form a preparatory meeting to plan concrete measures for this alliance organization." According to the specific plan revealed by Philippine officials, this "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance" will be composed of the Kuomintang, the Philippines, and South Korea, three puppet governments, to formulate details, and then invite other Far Eastern countries to participate, including Japan, which has not yet concluded a peace treaty. According to United Press news, after the Chiang-Quirino talks, bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek or Wu Tiecheng will visit MacArthur in Japan.

The Chiang Kai-shek-Quirino talks were held under the instigation of American imperialism. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Guangzhou on the 9th, before bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek went to the Philippines, Wu Tiecheng had frequently discussed the issue of organizing an "anti-communist group" with the US Consulate in Guangzhou. A United Press dispatch from Washington on the 10th also stated that US officials had received "notification" of the Chiang-Quirino talks a week before Chiang Kai-shek went to the Philippines. After the Chiang-Quirino talks began, US State Department spokesman McDermott on the 11th also declared "great sympathy" for their efforts. On the same day, US House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Kee publicly endorsed the Chiang-Quirino "anti-communist alliance" plan, saying it was "a valuable goal." American imperialism wants to use the Chiang-Quirino talks and the "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance" to encourage the "morale" of the Kuomintang remnants and continue their death throes.

Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the Philippines once again exposed the Kuomintang bandit army's crime of betraying the motherland and engaging in international adventures. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Hong Kong: "What the Kuomintang likes most, of course, is the outbreak of a US-Soviet war. Since this seems highly unlikely, the next best thing is some kind of Asian anti-communist common front."

However, the whole world knows that Chiang Kai-shek, this dead dog, is finished. During Chiang Kai-shek's stay in the Philippines, despite the hospitality of Quirino, another agent of American imperialism, the entire Philippine public opinion, including some pro-government newspapers, issued loud condemnations of Chiang Kai-shek. The pro-Philippine government Daily Mirror said: "Although we now have friendly relations with the Kuomintang regime, we still cannot afford to take independent action against Chiang Kai-shek. There is too much talk about forming a solid front with China (referring to the Kuomintang reactionaries) to combat communism, without thinking about how we can organize a united front with a regime that is still waiting for another country to help it fight."

　　妄图为垂死匪帮打气
  　美帝策动蒋季二棍徒
    鼓吹什么“反共联盟”
    全菲舆论都申斥蒋匪这条死狗　
    【新华社北平十四日电】各方报道：匪首蒋介石于飞抵菲律宾的夏都碧瑶后，即与菲总统季里诺于十、十一两日连续举行三次秘密会议，蒋介石在所谓联合声明于十一日晚公布后，已于十二日上午乘机飞返其台北匪巢。据合众社马尼拉十一日电称，蒋季联合声明首先扬言：“两国应立即采取具体而实际的步骤，以促进更密切的经济文化合作”，但是，尽人皆知，蒋介石与季里诺这两个棍徒谁在经济上也帮助不了谁。因此，合众社同电又称：“外交人士指出，中（国民党）、菲两国皆无任何实际价值的利益向对方提出。如谓菲律宾能予中国以经济援助，未免过于想象，因菲律宾本身亦极需经济援助。”
    蒋、季联合声明的主要部分，是鼓吹所谓远东各国“应立即组成联盟，互相援助，以抵制并消除共产党的威胁”。该声明建议，“凡愿意参加此一联盟的国家，应即派遣全权代表，组成筹备会议，以策划此一联盟组织的具体措施。”按照菲律宾官方透露的具体计划，这一“太平洋反共联盟”，将由国民党、菲律宾与南朝鲜三个傀儡政府，组成“核心”，拟出细节，然后邀请远东其他国家参加，包括尚未缔结和约的日本在内。据合众社消息，在蒋、季会谈结束以后，匪首蒋介石或铁城将赴日本访问麦克阿瑟。
    蒋介石与季里诺会谈是在美帝国主义策动之下举行的。据伪中央社广州九日电透露，在匪首蒋介石赴菲之前，吴铁城即曾与广州美领事署频频商谈组织“反共集团”问题。合众社华盛顿十日电亦称，美国官方在蒋介石赴菲一周之前，即已事先获得蒋、季会谈的“通知”。在蒋、季会谈开始之后，美国务院发言人麦克德谟十一日又宣称“十分同情”他们的努力。同日，美众院外委会主席季约翰亦公开赞同蒋、季的“反共联盟”计划，说这是“一个可贵的目标”。美帝国主义想借蒋、季会谈及“太平洋反共联盟”来鼓励国民党残匪的“士气”，继续进行垂死挣扎。
    蒋匪的访问菲律宾，又一次暴露了国民党匪军出卖祖国，进行国际冒险的罪行。据美联社香港电称：“国民党所最喜欢的当然是美苏之战爆发。既然这似乎极少可能，降而求其次，就是某种亚洲国家反共共同阵线。”
    但是，全世界都知道，蒋介石这条死狗已经完蛋了。在蒋匪在菲期间，尽管有美帝国主义另一代理人季里诺的招待，但全菲舆论甚至包括若干亲政府的报纸在内，都对蒋匪发出大声的申斥。亲菲律宾政府的每日镜报说：“尽管我们现在与国民党政权有友好关系，但对蒋介石采取独立行动，我们仍是吃不消的。与中国（指国民党反动派）成立巩固战线以对抗共产主义的空谈是太多了，毫没有想一想我们怎样和一个尚待另外一个国家拿钱帮助他打仗的政权组织统一战线。”
