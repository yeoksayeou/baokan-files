Overview of Spring Disease Incidence and Summer and Autumn Hygiene Work
Deputy Minister of Health, North China People's Government Liu Heyi

    Last winter lacked snow, and this spring lacked rain, causing bacteria, protozoa, and other microorganisms to multiply and spread extensively. Consequently, infectious diseases occurred and spread very widely this spring. For example, smallpox started in Xiyang in the Taihang Mountains and Ping Shan Zhangbei counties in the Chahar Province (having started last winter), and gradually spread to areas such as Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, Eastern Hebei, Tianjin, Jinzhong, and Taiyue. In Xiyang, Taihang, more than 100 people fell ill in over 70 villages, such as Huanglu Yan, a village of 300 households. In Taihang, those over 25 years old accounted for about two-thirds of the cases, and even elderly people aged 60 to 70 contracted the disease, which is cause for alarm. In Tian Si Village, Wanping, Chahar Province, more than 30 of the 40-plus primary school students contracted smallpox. In that province, most deaths were children under the age of 12, and other areas had similar examples.

    Secondly, measles and influenza were also prevalent, but the number of deaths was less than that of smallpox. In terms of measles and influenza, the former had a higher mortality rate, mostly due to complications of respiratory and brain diseases. For example, in Sanhe, Ji County, and Tangshan in Eastern Hebei, a total of 1,842 cases of measles and smallpox occurred in March and April, with the most cases and deaths being attributed to measles.

    Thirdly, Kala-azar was found in the Taihang and Hebei-Shandong-Henan areas, with many residents along the Yellow River and Zhang River contracting the disease. According to statistics from the two regions, the number of cases accounted for more than 5% of the total population, and the proportion of Kala-azar patients among the cases was very alarming. For example, in Wei Village, Qinyang, with a population of 1,500, 49 people were sick, of which 32 had Kala-azar, accounting for about 65%. Other diseases such as typhoid fever, diphtheria, pneumonia, chickenpox, and epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis occurred sporadically in areas such as Taiyuan, Taihang, Southern Chahar, Central Hebei, Taiyue, Southern Hebei, and Tianjin.

    In summary, the three most common, widespread, and deadly infectious diseases this spring were smallpox, measles, and influenza. Next came Kala-azar and typhoid fever, followed by diphtheria, pneumonia, chickenpox, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, and others. The reasons for this are generally: (1) The devastation of the people's lives by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries for more than a decade led to poor nutritional status. (2) Insufficient cultural propaganda and education, with lingering superstitious ideas and fatalistic notions among the masses, who sought gods and Buddhas, attempting to atone for sins and avoid disasters. (3) Few medical institutions, not many doctors, especially good ones, poor facilities, and expensive medicines. In particular, it was difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake medicines on the market, often leading to confusion and delayed treatment. (4) Weak public health administration, insufficient health education, and rudimentary equipment, which failed to promptly and universally mobilize the people to pay attention to hygiene, prevent diseases, and implement strict management. Although these infectious diseases occurred, failure to isolate them led to mutual infection and widespread epidemics. However, our leaders at all levels of government and the existing public health administrative organizations and health personnel have done their utmost to carry out prevention and control. For example, Central Hebei, Taihang, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and Chahar Province were able to mobilize local Chinese and Western doctors to form epidemic prevention teams to go to epidemic areas for epidemic prevention, medical treatment, propaganda, and management immediately after the outbreak. They also conducted pre-epidemic area surveys, divided working groups according to different situations, formulated plans, and carried out general epidemic prevention work, which was often able to stop infection and epidemics within one or two weeks. The most effective example was Lecheng in Taihang, which organized epidemic prevention during the spring smallpox epidemic to reach the planned number of vaccinations, curbing the epidemic within a week, and more than 20,000 people received practical propaganda and education within three days, changing their thinking and stopping them from seeking gods and Buddhas. The "Seven Days of Madness" drama performed in Hebei-Shandong-Henan had a great educational effect on the masses, and the half-month exhibition was visited by more than 100,000 people, who gained considerable understanding of health work. As the villagers said, "In the past, we had never seen or understood these things. When we got sick, we just looked for witches, asked for divine medicine, and worshiped divine water, not knowing how many people died as a result." At the same time, these epidemic prevention teams also organized health committees, united Chinese and Western doctors, and organized medical joint associations, Chinese and Western medicine research associations, and medical cooperatives to overcome the difficulties of the masses in finding medical treatment when they were sick. In this work, Central Hebei and Taihang have set good examples. Of course, this is not yet universal!

    Secondly, after the takeover of urban sanitation work in Tianjin and Beijing, a plan was drawn up to transport the garbage left behind by the Kuomintang reactionary government in batches. The first step of the plan was completed in April, with a total of more than 9.33 million cubic meters of garbage being removed from the two cities, which was not completely removed until mid-June. At the same time, special attention was paid to spring and summer epidemic prevention, organizing vaccinations and disinfection work, etc., stipulating management regulations for bathhouses, restaurants, and cold food, carrying out various management measures, handling doctor re-certification registrations, and controlling drug dealers, who were not allowed to broadcast and deceive the masses without inspection and registration. Epidemic prevention medical teams were organized to patrol various areas to carry out prevention and treatment.

    Thirdly, the North China People's Government Health Department also organized epidemic prevention brigades to patrol various areas to carry out epidemic prevention and hygiene work. In Pingshan, an experimental area was created, starting with vaccination and treatment, and simultaneously conducting disease surveys, home visits, and symposiums. Work was carried out by relying on administrative organization to gather the masses, establish county and seven district health committees, and establish them in 201 villages, regularly carrying out work, with the vast majority reporting work and reflecting situations to the districts. Five district medical cooperatives and county and district Chinese and Western medicine research associations were organized, bringing together 242 doctors, and all villages with two or more doctors were organized into groups, enthusiastically reflecting work, studying difficult problems, and training 564 old midwives in 143 villages, most of whom played a role. For example, in one month, the 14 village midwifery groups delivered 14 babies without any deaths from tetanus, improving their skills and gaining more support from the masses. Other epidemic prevention teams sent to Chicheng, Anci, Eastern Hebei, etc., were able to carry out work according to this year's health work guidelines and achieved great results.

    From this, we have gained the following experiences and lessons:

    1.  To carry out health and epidemic prevention, we must follow the mass line and combine it with the central work of the government, and only by meeting the interests of the masses can it be carried out. When the epidemic prevention teams in Taihang, Central Hebei, and Southern Chahar (Pingshan) went to prevent smallpox and carry out vaccination this spring, it was precisely the time to launch spring plowing. The comrades of the epidemic prevention teams proposed treating diseases for production and vaccinating to prevent smallpox, which coincided with the psychology of the masses, and the vaccination work was able to be carried out. This was also the case in Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Southern Hebei. Therefore, preliminary statistics show that more than 2.5 million people were vaccinated throughout the region this spring (414,524 in Central Hebei alone, and 365,616 in Tianjin and Beijing).

    2.  To carry out health and epidemic prevention work, it is necessary to rely on the strength of cadres and organizations to promote it, and it is necessary to investigate and study and understand the situation, unite activists, and be good at using the actual examples at hand to mobilize the masses in order to achieve certain results. This is evidenced by the epidemic prevention propaganda in Lecheng, Taihang, the health exhibition in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and the midwifery training by the epidemic prevention team in Pingshan.

    3.  As evidenced by the epidemic prevention teams in many areas, the development of health, epidemic prevention, and medical work makes it possible to overcome superstitious ideas of seeking gods and Buddhas, improve health knowledge, and improve the health of the masses.

    4.  Without a sound health leadership organization and strong cadres, there are still many difficulties in health work. For example, if epidemic prevention work is not carried out by capable people who investigate and study and understand the infectious diseases that have occurred and been prevalent among the masses over the years, as well as the occurrence of endemic diseases and unhygienic phenomena in life, and formulate and implement plans to proceed step by step, otherwise, fragmented, piecemeal approaches will often lead to a passive situation. Thus, after receiving reports of outbreaks, until people are sent or Chinese and Western doctors are organized to go to the countryside to carry out epidemic prevention, the epidemic has already become a disaster.

    5.  The leadership has not fully understood or paid enough attention to the further demands of the masses for health and medical work after land reform, and has not promptly inspected and supervised them, so that they have not been able to meet the needs of the masses and satisfy possible requirements, and to carry out education and health and medical organization work.

    6.  In many areas, cadres have poor technical capabilities and have not been able to diagnose and discover the source of infectious diseases early, or have failed to report them, thus causing mutual infection and the spread of diseases or falsely determining disease names and inaccurate reporting.

    It is now mid-summer, and autumn is coming. The rainy season has arrived, and all bacteria are multiplying more vigorously, and mosquitoes and flies are rampant. Infectious diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and malaria are more likely to occur. In densely populated cities, serious attention must be paid to epidemic prevention work, launching cleaning campaigns, continuing to remove garbage, and strictly managing street sanitation, public places, toilets, ponds, restaurants, hotels, bathhouses, meat and vegetable markets, cold food stores, and entertainment venues. Universal epidemic prevention injections must be carried out, and outbreaks of epidemics must be promptly discovered and extinguished. Carrying out epidemic prevention education in general rural areas to improve the health knowledge of the masses is still a serious task. All health agencies should combine with local mass organizations to organize epidemic prevention committees and carry out epidemic prevention work in a step-by-step manner. Attention must be paid to the control work in epidemic areas, and epidemic prevention medical teams should regularly patrol various places, and mechanically use both centralized and decentralized methods according to local conditions to prevent problems before they occur and vigorously extinguish them. This is what we should do in summer and autumn hygiene work.

    今春发病概况与夏秋季卫生工作
    华北人民政府卫生部副部长  刘和一
    去冬乏雪，今春缺雨，致使细菌、原虫等微生物繁殖传播很甚，遂于今春发生传染病，流行甚为普遍。如天花由太行的昔阳，察省的平山张北等县开始（去冬已开始），冀中、冀南、冀东、平津、晋中、太岳等区，也逐渐流行。太行昔阳有七十余村如黄路延三百户的村庄，就有一百多人发病，在太行发生天花者，二十五岁以上的约占发病数三分之二，甚至六十至七十岁的老人亦有发生，值得警惕。察省宛平田寺村小学生四十余人即患天花三十多个，该省死亡多为十二岁以下的孩子，其他区亦有这样例子。
    其次是麻疹、流行性感冒，也普遍流行，唯死亡数较天花尚少。就麻疹与流行性感冒来说，以前者死亡数为大，多系合并呼吸系及脑系疾病所致。如冀东的三河、蓟县、唐山，在三至四月共发生麻疹天花为一千八百四十二人，发生麻疹与死亡者为最多。
    再次如黑热病，发现于太行、冀鲁豫区，沿黄河、漳河两岸居民感染发病不少，就两地统计，发病数占总人数百分之五以上，而黑热病患者占发病数字则非常可畏。如沁阳魏村人口一千五百人，患病者四十九人，其中黑热病者即为三十二人，约占百分之六十五多。他如伤寒、白喉、肺炎、水痘、流行性脑脊髓膜炎等于太原、太行、察南、冀中、太岳、冀南、平津等区有一病或数病呈散在性的发生。
    总之，今春传染病以天花、麻疹、流行性感冒三种发生多，流行广，死亡亦大；其次为黑热病、伤寒；再次为白喉、肺炎、水痘、流行性脑脊髓膜炎等。究其原因概为：（１）十余年来日寇、国民党反动派的对人民生活的摧残蹂躏，致使营养状态不良。（２）文化宣传教育不够，群众中残存着迷信思想、命运观念，求神拜佛，企图恕罪免灾。（３）医药机构少，医生不多，尤以好的少，设置差，药价贵，特别是市面零售药品真假难识，常鱼目混珠，耽误治疗。（４）卫生行政力量薄弱，卫生教育不够，设备简陋，未能及时的普遍的发动人民注意卫生，预防疾病与施行严格管理。虽由此传染病发生，不加隔离，互相感染致流行广泛，然而我们各级政府领导者及现有的卫生行政组织，与卫生人员曾克尽其责大力进行防治，如冀中、太行、冀鲁豫等区及察省均能在发病后即发动本地中西医生组成防疫队，前往疫区进行防疫医疗宣传与管理，并事先勘察疫区，根据不同情况划分工作小组，订出计划，进行一般的防疫工作，多能在一二周内即可制止感染与流行。收效最大的如太行黎城，于春季天花流行时组织防疫达到预计种痘数目，周内遏止了流行，并于三天之内有两万余人受到实际的宣传教育，转变思想不去求神拜佛。冀鲁豫的“七天疯”剧演出，对群众教育很大，半个月的展览会有十余万人的参观等，对卫生工作有了相当的认识。如老乡说：“过去咱们没见过，不懂得，只是有了病找巫婆，求神药，拜神水，不知误死多少人”。同时这些防疫队还组织卫生委员会，团结了中西医，组织医药联合会、中西医研究会及医药合作社等来克服群众有病找不到医药救治的困难。在这工作上，如冀中、太行，做的有很好的例子。当然还不够普遍！
    其次，平津城市卫生工作接管之后，遂拟定计划分批运输了国民党反动政府在这裹遗留的垃圾，在四月完成第一步计划，两市共运出垃圾九百三十三万多公方，直至六月中旬始完全运尽。同时特别重视春季、夏季防疫问题，组织种痘注射疫苗，及消毒工作等，规定澡堂、饭馆及冷食等管理条例，进行各种管理，办理医师换证登记，及管制药商，非经检验登记不得随便广播，欺骗群众，并组织防疫医疗队，巡回各区进行预防与治疗。
    再次，华北人民政府卫生部亦组织防疫大队，巡回各区进行防疫卫生工作，并在平山创造实验区，首先以种痘治病开始，同时即进行疾病调查，家庭拜访和座谈会，并通过行政依靠组织集合群众来进行工作，建立县和七个区卫生委员会，在二百零一村亦建立起来，经常进行工作，极多数向区汇报工作反映情况，组织了五个区医药合作社和县区中西医研究会，组织起二百四十二名医生，并将村里有两个以上的医生均编成小组，热情的反映工作，研究疑难问题，并训练了一百四十三个村五百六十四名旧接生婆，大部起到作用。如十四个村助产小组在一个月内收生十四名，没有因破伤风致死的，提高了她们的技术，更为群众所拥护。其他如派往赤城、安次、冀东等防疫队均能照今年卫生工作方针进行工作且收效颇大。
    由此我们得到的经验与教训：
    一、进行卫生防疫必须走群众路线，并与政府的中心工作相结合，切合群众利益始可开展。当今春太行、冀中、察南（平山）等处的防疫队去防止天花进行种痘时，恰是发动春耕时期，而防疫队的同志就提出为生产而治病，为防止不得天花而种痘，恰合群众心理，遂得开展种痘工作。冀鲁豫、冀南，也有这种情况。故今春种痘者在全区初步统计约有二百五十万人以上（只冀中一处，即有四十一万四千五百二十四人，平津两市即有三十六万五千六百十六人）。
    二、进行卫生防疫工作只有依靠干部组织力量，才能推动，并要调查研究了解情况，团结积极分子，善于以眼前的实际例子发动群众，始可收到一定的效果。如太行黎成之防疫宣传、冀鲁豫的卫生展览及平山防疫队的助产训练，均可证明。
    三、由不少地区防疫队的证明，卫生防疫医疗工作的开展，才有可能克服求神拜佛的迷信思想，提高卫生常识，增进群众健康。
    四、没有健全的卫生领导机构与强有力的干部，因此卫生工作上还存在着不少的困难。如防疫工作没有能人按照计划事先调查研究了解群众中历年来的传染则流行及地方病的发生与生活习惯中不卫生现象而订定实施方案，逐步进行，否则零碎的突击式的头痛医头的方法去做，遂常常处于被动，致在接得发病报告后，直至派人或组织中西医生下乡进行防疫时，疫病已流行成灾。
    五、领导上对土改后群众在卫生医疗工作上有进一步的要求了解不够或重视还差，没有及时检查督促，遂未能恰合群众需要，满足可能的要求，进行教育与卫生医药组织工作。
    六、有不少地区干部技术能力差，未能及早诊断发现传染病的来源，或不加报告，遂使互相感染蔓延疾病或冒定病名，报告不确。
    目前已入仲夏，秋季将来，雨季已到，一切细菌滋生更旺，蚊蝇也正猖獗，霍乱、赤痢、虐疾等传染病更易发生。在人烟稠密的城市，对防疫工作更须严重的注意，发动清洁运动，继续清除垃圾，对于街道卫生、公共场所、厕所、池塘、饭店、旅舍、澡堂、菜肉市、冷食店、娱乐场所必须严加管理，普遍地进行防疫注射，及时发现疫病发生及时扑灭。一般农村进行防疫教育，提高群众卫生常识，仍是一个严重的任务，一切卫生机关，应结合当地群众团体，组织防疫委员会，有步骤地进行防疫工作，进行防疫注射，必须注意疫区的管制工作，各防疫医疗队应经常巡回各地，根据当地病情，机械地使用集中与分散两种方法，防于未然，大力扑灭，这是我们夏秋季卫生工作应该做到的。
