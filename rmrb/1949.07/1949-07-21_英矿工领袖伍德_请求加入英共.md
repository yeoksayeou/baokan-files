Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: London dispatch: British delegate to the World Peace Congress, John Wood, Vice Chairman of the Scottish Division of the National Union of Mineworkers, has decided to request to join the British Communist Party because he is "certain that the entire policy of the Communist Party is based on defending the living conditions of the workers." Three weeks ago, Wood was expelled from the Labour Party because he had attacked the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty as instruments of war.

　　英矿工领袖伍德
  　请求加入英共
    【新华社北平二十日电】伦敦讯：出席世界和平大会的英国代表，全国矿工联盟苏格兰区分会副主席约翰·伍德，顷决定请求加入英共，因为他“确知共产党的整个政策是以保卫工人的生活条件为基础的”。三周以前，伍德被工党开除，因为，他曾攻击马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约是战争的工具。
