Qingdao
(Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th) Workers in Qingdao's public factories and railway enterprises are actively engaged in production with a new work attitude. The production volume of some factories has increased compared to before liberation. The Qilu Flour Mill's highest daily output before liberation was 1,353 bags, and now it has increased to 1,440 bags. The No. 1 Textile Factory of the China Textile Corporation used to weave 800 catties of yarn per day, but now it can weave 920 catties with the same time and manpower. During the major cleaning of the Si Cang Power Plant on the 11th of this month, 25 people completed the work in eight hours that used to take at least 11 hours for 32 people to complete. When a mechanical factory manufactured spikes to supply the emergency repair of the Jiaoji Railway, the number of screws turned per person increased from a maximum of 120 to 220. When the Qingdao Railway Station Electrical Section employees carried out the task of erecting 68 kilometers of wiring, the half-month plan was completed two days ahead of schedule. In addition, workers in units such as the waterworks have launched a campaign to save materials. The foreman and other workers of the plant melted the accumulated scrap lead since the plant was built in 1939 into 184 catties of good lead; and repaired some broken faucets in their spare time into good faucets. On July 11, when the boiler of China Textile Corporation's No. 2 Factory was supplying steam to the sizing workshop, the tow chain suddenly broke, which immediately stopped the steam supply to the sizing workshop. In order to keep production uninterrupted, foreman Gao Mingyi ignored the heat and used a jack to lift the chain and quickly replaced the iron chain, restoring the steam supply in only five minutes, saving the time of replacing the spare furnace and three or four tons of raw coal. The creations of employees in some factories are also extremely valuable. The high-voltage switchboards used in the Qingdao Power Plant used to be purchased as finished products or parts from Japan and the United States. After liberation, the engineers carefully designed them, and the workers carefully manufactured and installed them. As a result, after the first unit was produced, the trial effect was no less than that of imported products, and they are now working hard to complete ten high-voltage switchboards.
(Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th) The takeover of Qingdao's bureaucratic capitalist heavy industry units was completed in the first ten days of this month. The main units taken over include: the 44th Factory of the Kuomintang Joint Logistics Ordnance Department, the Qingdao Power Plant, the Fangzi Coal Mine Material Office, the Shandong Aluminum Industry Preparatory Office, the North China Iron and Steel Company and the Coking Plant, the Yanghui Plant, the Central Machinery Co., Ltd., the Beiyi Coking Plant, and the Qingdao Naval Shipyard, all belonging to the Kuomintang Resources Committee. For enterprises that are in good condition, such as the Qingdao Power Plant, the People's Government first plans to resume production; for most production institutions whose materials have been moved away or destroyed by the enemy and only a small part of the materials exist (such as shipyards), it will select the original employees on the one hand, plan production, and on the other hand, carry out inventory work; for military industrial production units that have been completely moved away by the enemy (such as the 44th Factory of the Joint Logistics Ordnance Department), it will seize the opportunity to educate the remaining personnel, stabilize their emotions, understand the situation, clarify the materials, and help unemployed workers find employment and change jobs. The inventory work in the takeover is very complicated and arduous, but because the inventory committee is jointly composed of work teams, workers, and employees in advance, the employees are educated, and the inventory methods and steps are discussed in detail, so many important materials are checked out.

　　重工业已接管完成工人积极增产节约
  　青岛
    【新华社济南二十八日电】青岛各公营工厂及铁道企业中的工人，正以新的劳动态度，积极从事生产。有些工厂的生产量已较解放前提高，齐鲁面粉厂解放前夕最高日产量是一千三百五十三袋，现在增至一千四百四十袋。中纺的针织厂过去每日织八百斤纱，现在用同等时间和人力，能织九百二十斤。四沧发电所本月十一日大扫除时，二十五个人八个钟头做完了过去三十二个人最少需十一个钟头才能干完的活。某机械厂在制造道钉供应抢修胶济路时，旋螺丝钉由过去最高一百二十个增到二百二十个。青岛车站电气段员工执行六十八公里的架线任务时，半月计划提前两天完成。此外自来水厂等单位工人又开展节约器材运动。该厂领班工人等五人把从一九三九年建厂以来堆集的碎铅，炼成了一百八十四斤好铅；并把过去一些破龙头，在工余时修成了好龙头。七月十一日中纺二厂的锅炉正在供给浆纱间的蒸汽时，忽然拖链断了，这一故障使供应浆纱间的蒸汽马上停止。为了使生产不停，班长高明义不顾热灸，用千斤顶顶起链＠，迅速换好铁链，只五分钟即恢复了供汽，节省了换用预备炉的时间和三、四吨生火煤。有的工厂中职工的创造也是极可贵的。青岛电厂用的高压电盘，过去全是由日本和美国买来的成货或零件，解放后工程师们便精密设计，工人们认真地制造和装置，结果第一部作出后，试用效果竟不亚于舶来品，现正为完成十台高压电盘而努力。
    【新华社济南二十八日电】青岛官僚资本的各重工业单位的接管工作，已于本月上旬完成。接管的主要单位有：国民党联勤兵工署四十四厂，国民党资源委员会所属之青岛电厂、坊子煤矿材料处、山东铝业筹备处、华北钢铁公司及炼焦厂、洋灰厂、中央机器有限公司、北义炼焦厂、青岛海军造船厂等。人民政府对完好无损的企业，如青岛电厂等，首先筹划复工生产；对大部分物资已被敌人搬走或破坏而只有小部分物资存在的生产机构（如造船厂），则一面选拔原有职员，筹划生产，一面进行清点工作；对被敌人全部搬走的军工生产单位（如联勤兵工署四十四厂），则抓紧对留守人员进行教育，稳定情绪，了解情况，弄清物资，并帮助失业工人就业转业。接管中的清点工作甚为复杂艰巨，但因事前由工作队、工人、职员共同组成清点委员会，对员工进行了教育，详细讨论了清点方法和步骤，因此检查出许多重要物资。
