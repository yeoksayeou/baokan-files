Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 29th: TASS reports: The high degree of mechanization in the Soviet coal industry has built a bridge across the divide between physical and mental labor. Currently, the coal industry is continuing to move in the direction of completely eliminating the boundaries between physical and mental labor. The level of mechanization in the Soviet coal industry was already the highest in the world before the war in 1938, and the degree of mechanization after the war has greatly exceeded the pre-war level. The production processes of many large coal mines in the Moscow Oblast, Donets Basin, and Kuznetsk Basin will be fully mechanized this year. A high degree of mechanization has transformed arduous and heavy coal mining work into light and pleasant work, and has greatly increased productivity. For example, Kucherov, the driver of a combined coal mining machine in the Donbas coal mine, and his partners complete 260 percent of their production plan every day. Currently, many coal mine trusts, such as "Moscow" and "Molotov," have already reached the production level of 1950.

At the same time, the Soviet government is particularly concerned about the lives of miners. Employees in other industries can only share bonuses after working for three years, while coal mine employees can share bonuses after working for one year. In the past two years, the Soviet government has distributed more than 1.2 billion rubles in bonuses to coal mine employees. Eighty-five percent of this is given to workers, and fifteen percent is given to engineers, technicians, and other staff. The bonuses account for 10 to 30 percent of their annual income. The amount of the bonus depends on the length of service. Veteran miners who have worked in the mines for decades receive particularly large bonuses.

The state not only builds a large number of public housing for miners, but also provides them with long-term loans with a ten-year repayment period to help them build their own homes. In the past three years, they have borrowed more than 600 million yuan to build more than 60,000 houses.

　　努力消灭体力与智力劳动界限
  　苏采煤工业高度机械化
    许多煤矿已达明年生产水平
    【新华社北平二十九日电】塔斯社讯：苏联采煤工业的高度机械化，已在体力劳动和智力劳动之间的鸿沟上，架起了一座桥梁，目前采煤工业正继续向完全消灭体力劳动与智力劳动界限的方向前进。苏联采煤工业机械化的程度，在战前一九三八年就已占世界第一位，战后机械化的程度，又已大大超过了战前水平。莫斯科州、顿尼兹盆地和库兹涅茨克盆地许多大煤矿的生产过程，今年将全部机械化。高度的机械化已使艰苦繁重的采煤工作，变为轻松愉快的工作，并且使生产率大大提高。例如顿巴斯煤矿一个联合采煤机的司机库契罗夫和他的伙伴们，每天都完成生产计划的百分之二百六十。现在，有许多煤矿托拉斯如“莫斯科”、“莫洛托夫”等，都已达到一九五○年的生产水平。
    同时，苏联政府对矿工的生活特别关心。其他各业的职工工作满三年才能分红利，而煤矿业职工工作一年就可分红。过去两年中苏联政府发给煤矿职工的红利达十二余亿卢布。其中百分之八十五分给工人，百分之十五分给工程师、技师和其他职员。分红占他们每年收入的百分之十到三十。分红的多少，取决于工作时间的长短。在矿坑里工作了几十年的老矿工，所得的分红特别巨大。
    国家不仅给矿工们大量建筑公共住宅，而且还借给他们十年分期还清的长期贷款，帮助他们建筑个人的住宅。三年来他们已经借到六亿元的贷款，建筑了住房六万多间。
