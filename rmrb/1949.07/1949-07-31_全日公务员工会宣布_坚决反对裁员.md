Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th -- According to a Reuter's Tokyo dispatch: The executive committee of the All Japan Government Employees Union Federation, which has 600,000 members, passed a resolution on the 28th, announcing that the federation will fight to the end against the government's layoff plan. The resolution pointed out that the Yoshida government's "dismissal" of the seventeen left-wing members of the Central Struggle Committee of the National Railway Workers Union is a "political conspiracy" by the reactionary cabinet to split the railway workers' union. On the same day, the seventeen members of the Central Struggle Committee of the National Railway Workers Union formally filed a lawsuit with the Tokyo District Court, accusing the president of the National Railway Corporation of violating the Labor Relations Law's provision that employees shall not be dismissed for engaging in trade union activities. The lawsuit demanded that the government halt its layoff plan. The National Railway Workers Union Federation has approximately 600,000 members and is one of the largest trade unions in Japan. Although the chairman of the federation is the reactionary Kato Etsuo, the secretary-general and vice-chairman are both communists. Of the twenty-eight members of the Central Struggle Committee, communists and progressives account for seventeen, while members of the reactionary "Democratization League" account for only eleven. The Yoshida government used the pretext of "layoffs" this time to dismiss all seventeen left-wing members.

　　全日公务员工会宣布
  　坚决反对裁员
    【新华社北平三十日电】据路透社东京消息：拥有六十万会员的全日公务员工会联合会执行委员会，于二十八日通过决议，宣布该联合会决与政府的裁员计划斗争到底。决议指出吉田政府的“裁退”国营铁道工人工会中央斗争委员会的十七名左翼委员，是反动内阁分裂铁道工会的“政治阴谋”。同日，国营铁道工人工会中央斗争委员会的十七名委员正式向东京地方法院提出诉讼，控告国营会社总裁违反劳工关系法中关于不得因从事职工会活动而开除职工的规定。控诉书要求政府停止其裁员计划。按国营铁道工人工会联合会拥有会员约六十万，为日本最大职工会之一。该联合会主席虽为反动分子加藤悦男，但总书记与副主席均为共产党员。在中央斗争委员会二十八名委员中，共产党员及进步分子占十七名，反动的“民主化同盟”分子只占十一名。吉田政府这次借口“裁员”，将十七名左翼委员全部裁去。
