Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th: The Shanghai Municipal People's Government is making every effort to lead the people of Shanghai in disaster relief and post-disaster work to overcome the damage caused by the typhoon. A large number of disaster victims are being taken in by refugee shelters in various districts. Agencies, troops, organizations, workers, and students have launched a campaign to save food and provide relief to disaster victims. Order is rapidly being restored throughout the city.

　　The typhoon that hit Shanghai this time was the largest in eighteen years. It moved northwest from Palau Island in the Pacific Ocean on the 20th, and landed in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, on the afternoon of the 24th. By 9:00 p.m. that day, Shanghai was completely engulfed in the storm. The wind speed was 55 nautical miles per hour, and the wind only returned to normal at 6:00 p.m. on the 25th. At that time, it was the high tide of the Huangpu River. Under the typhoon, the river water poured back into the city, and most of the suburbs and low-lying areas of the city became flooded, with water depths ranging from one to six feet. The shack areas in Zhabei, Hongkou, and Yangshupu, north of the Suzhou River, were the worst hit, with about half of the shack roofs blown off by the typhoon and one-third of the shacks having water depths of one to two feet. About 100,000 to 200,000 disaster victims in the city fled to the city center. The severity of the typhoon exceeded that of 1931.

　　When the typhoon and rainstorm hit Shanghai, most of the staff of the People's Government, the PLA garrison troops, and the workers bravely went out to fight fires, drain water, and rescue machinery and materials despite the strong winds and heavy rain. Dozens of fires broke out throughout the city due to damaged power lines. Firefighters from the Municipal Public Security Bureau and workers from the Shanghai Electric Power Company went day and night to put out the fires and repair the power lines. Cadres and guards from the Municipal Government and its subordinate districts and public security sub-bureaus went to the disaster areas to rescue refugees. The Lin Sen Road Songshan Public Security Sub-Bureau alone dispatched more than 100 people, rescuing more than 300 disaster victims and immediately placing them in nearby factories and public places. Of the city's eleven flood control pumping stations, seven were operated by workers in shifts day and night to drain the accumulated water, except for five that could not be used due to being submerged or having damaged power lines. The machine rooms of the No. 3 Printing and Dyeing Factory of China Textile, the No. 1 Knitting Factory of China Textile, the Liberation Daily, the News Daily, and the Wen Hui Daily were all flooded, but no major losses were suffered after the workers made great efforts to rescue them. The Liberation Daily and the News Daily were published as usual on the 25th. The garrison troops in various factories actively cooperated in the rescue efforts. When the No. 3 Printing and Dyeing Factory of China Textile was transporting sulfuric acid, seven PLA soldiers were injured due to sulfuric acid splashing or exploding when it came into contact with water.

　　After the typhoon struck, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Government immediately held an emergency disaster relief meeting, deciding to organize refugee relief committees in various districts, set up refugee shelters in various districts according to the disaster situation, and mobilize trade unions, the Youth Federation, the Student Federation, the Women's Federation, the business community, and charitable organizations to assist in emergency relief. The meeting also decided to allocate funds from the donations of the current Shanghai People's Army Support campaign for disaster relief and called on the people of Shanghai to actively donate. After the meeting, disaster relief work was quickly launched. Shanghai's largest amusement park, the Great World, has been set up as a refugee shelter, and public places in the urban area have also been used to house refugees. The Municipal Government is also working with the relief committee to distribute relief grain. The PLA soldiers garrisoning Shanghai, in addition to strictly preventing special agents from taking advantage of the opportunity to protect the lives and property of the people in the disaster areas, are also actively helping to resettle the refugees. Some units have even given up their dormitories for the refugees to live in. The movement to save food and provide relief to disaster victims has been enthusiastically responded to. The entire soldiers of a certain unit automatically saved 10,000 kilograms of rice for disaster relief. The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in addition to calling on various trade unions to directly participate in the disaster relief work in various districts, decided to change from two meals and one porridge a day to two porridge and one meal from the 26th to save rice for disaster relief. The Shanghai Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Shanghai Student Union, and the preparatory committee of the Youth Federation jointly issued an emergency notice calling on the youth to mobilize urgently to assist the government in completing disaster relief work. Sixty students from the Tongji University Medical College who stayed at school during the summer vacation have decided to save 120 kilograms of grain from their seven-day food supply until the end of the month for disaster relief. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Health Department has mobilized the Red Cross and other welfare organizations and medical students to organize refugee medical teams, and has notified all public and private hospitals to accommodate and treat injured or sick refugees as much as possible, while vigorously carrying out epidemic prevention work.

　　On the 26th, the Shanghai Liberation Daily published an editorial entitled "Unite and Overcome the Typhoon Disaster," believing that the unexpected typhoon disaster was a major test for the party, government, army, and people of Shanghai, and that this disaster must be overcome. After putting forward the four current urgent tasks of providing relief and resettlement to disaster victims, preventing diseases and epidemics, preventing the activities of special agents and bandits, and rescuing public facilities and buildings, the editorial pointed out that with the unity and cooperation of the entire party, government, army, and people, there is bound to be confidence in overcoming the typhoon disaster.

　　战胜十八年来最大一次台灾
  　沪秩序迅速恢复
    各机关、部队、团体、工人、学生热烈展开节约救灾运动
    【新华社上海二十八日电】上海市人民政府正全力领导上海人民进行救灾善后工作，以克服台风所造成的灾害。大批的灾民正由各区难民收容所收容。各机关、部队、团体和工人、学生，已展开了节约粮食救济灾民的运动。全市秩序正在迅速恢复中。
    此次上海所遭受的台风是十八年来最大的一次，二十日由太平洋帛利琉岛向西北移动，二十四日下午在浙江宁波登陆，当日下午九时，上海即全部卷入暴风雨中。暴风时速五十五海里，至二十五日下午六时风势始恢复常态。当时正值黄浦江潮期，在台风下，江水倒灌市内，市郊大部地区及市内低洼地区顿成泽国，水深一至六尺。苏州河以北闸北、虹口、杨树浦一带的棚户地区灾情最重，约有二分之一以上的棚户屋顶均被台风揭翻，三分之一的棚户屋内水深一至二尺。全市约有一、二十万灾民逃入市中心。台灾之重，超过一九三一年的规模。
    当台风暴雨猛袭沪市时，人民政府的大部工作人员、解放军警备部队和工人们即英勇地冒着狂风骤雨四出救火排水，抢救机器物资。全市电线遭受破坏而走电失火者曾达数十起，市公安局消防队员和上海电力公司工人都日夜前往扑救及抢修电线。市政府和所属各区、各公安分局干部、警卫人员都出动赴灾区抢救难民，仅林森路嵩山公安分局即出动百余人，抢救出灾民三百余人，并即安置于附近的工厂和公共场所内。全市十一个防洪唧水站，除五个因被淹没或电线被破坏无法使用外，其余七个都由工人轮班日夜开动疏导积水。中纺第三印染厂、中纺第一针织厂、解放日报、新闻日报、文汇报等报馆的机器房均被水浸入，经职工大力抢救后，未遭重大损失。解放日报和新闻日报于二十五日照常出版。各工厂驻军都积极协同抢救，中纺第三印染厂在搬运硫酸时，即有解放军战士七人因硫酸泼出或遇水爆炸而受伤。
    台灾发生后，中共上海市委及人民政府曾立即召开了救灾紧急会议，决定在各区组织难民救济委员会，各区按灾情设立难民收容所，动员工会、青联、学联、妇联、工商界及慈善机关协助急救。会议并决定在此次上海人民劳军的捐献中拨款作为救灾之用，号召上海人民踊跃输将。会后，救灾工作即迅速展开。沪市最大的游艺场——大世界已设立难民收容所，市区各公共场所也均安置难民，市府并配合救济委员会发放救济粮。警备沪市的解放军战士们，除严防特务乘机活动，保护灾区人民的生命财产外，并积极帮助安置难民，有些单位还让出自己的宿舍给难民住。节约粮食救济灾民的运动，受到热烈响应。某部全体战士自动节约大米一万斤救灾。沪市总工会筹委会除号召各工会直接参加各区救灾工作外，并决定自二十六日起，将每天两饭一粥改成两粥一饭，节省食米救济难民。青年团上海工委会、上海学生联合会及青联筹委会联合发出紧急通知，号召青年紧急动员起来，协助政府完成救灾工作。同济大学医学院暑期留校同学六十人已决定在至月底的七天粮食中节省一百二十斤救灾。此外，沪市卫生部已动员红十字会等福利团体及医学院的学生组织难民医疗队，并通知各公私立医院尽量收容及医治受伤或患病的难民，同时大力进行防疫工作。
    二十六日，上海解放日报以“团结起来，战胜台灾”为题发表社论，认为意外的台灾是对上海党政军民的一个重大考验，必须战胜这一灾害。社论在提出救济和安置灾民，救病防疫，防止特务匪徒活动及抢救公用设备和建筑物等目前四大紧急工作后，指出，在全体党政军民的团结和合作下，一定有把握战胜台灾。
