He emphasized that the delegation should accept the instructions given by Vice Chairman Zhou and Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, a few days ago, and be modest, prudent, and guard against arrogance and impetuosity. Liao Chengzhi, head of the delegation, pointed out that the delegation should consciously feel the great responsibility, and therefore must consciously strengthen the discipline and collectivity of action. Mr. Wu Han pointed out that the delegation's trip abroad represents the New Democratic China led by the Communist Party, and will be warmly welcomed by democratic youth all over the world. Therefore, every member of the delegation should pay attention to their personal words and actions. Qian Sanqiang shared his experience of attending the World Congress for the Defense of Peace, pointing out that without the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people and Chinese youth would not have today's glory.
