　　The Amateur Drama Troupe of the
  　Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    Yan Jun
    The predecessor of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's amateur drama troupe was the Youth League Drama Troupe. It was organized by some employees in the factory who loved drama. In the past, it had performed some dramas, such as "Thunderstorm" and "Nepotism." It already had a certain foundation in various techniques such as lighting, set design, and makeup.
    After liberation, everyone was happy! To celebrate the first liberated New Year, the troupe worked day and night to rehearse the drama "Conscripting Soldiers." Workers who had never acted before also wanted to try their hand at acting. So, in addition to the Yangko dance during the New Year, the workers also spontaneously organized themselves, wrote, directed, and performed short dramas "Who is One of Us?" "Love Lu Factory" and "Oppose False Peace Living Newspaper." During this period, a surging upsurge of cultural and recreational activities formed in the Iron and Steel Plant. It can also be said that a new page in the literary and artistic movement of the Iron and Steel Plant unfolded from the first New Year after liberation.
    At the request of the workers and the call of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Workers' Preparatory Committee, more than seventy members registered in a few days, and the "Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Amateur Drama Troupe" was officially established.
　　Self-written, self-acted, performing our own affairs, educating ourselves.
    "Self-written, self-acted, performing our own affairs, educating ourselves." This was written on the slogan of the troupe's inaugural meeting. This is the troupe's work policy and the confidence of all members. After the troupe was established, the first important task was to write scripts. As a worker said, "The script is like an engine. If it doesn't move, other departments can't move." So the first step was to mobilize a large number of members. Those who could write and those who couldn't all participated in the scriptwriting group.
    How to write? Some said, "Let's start writing from the time when the Japanese were here, writing about how the Kuomintang exploited and oppressed us, all the way to how we are liberated now, how we are producing..." Some said, "Too long! How many acts would that take? We have to walk like children, step by step!" It's better to write short ones. Then what to write? At the beginning, everyone talked about the new things in the factory after liberation, just like telling stories. For example, when talking about how the factory proposed "not to miss a needle or a thread" during the inventory movement, some specifically talked about "XX braving the drizzle to push a cart around to pick up broken iron pipes and hand them over to the factory." Some then said, "XX handed over things he had stolen from the factory in the past. He voluntarily handed them over to the inventory committee." Raising one point, everyone continued to develop it endlessly. Enriching this matter according to the different situations of each factory produced the theme. When talking about characters, some workers happily talked and gestured, writing down the person's voice, actions, slang, etc. When the story was almost put together, everyone joined a group according to what kind of content they wanted to write.
    There are many ways to write. Some people write first and then ask everyone for their opinions. Some people discuss and modify while writing. For example, when the workers' dormitory group in Chibeicun wrote "Being the Masters of Our Own House," they used the second method. It was the same with scriptwriting and directing: one person acts, everyone watches. Sometimes an action in the play is very good, and the people below shout "Good! Keep it!" Sometimes when the actor's performance is not realistic, the workers in the audience run up "Come, let me try and you see," and after he finishes, the actor will watch and then do it again. Some people first remember which points are bad and talk about them after the rehearsal is over. In short, no matter which method is used, it embodies the spirit of collective learning and collective creation.
    From the beginning to the performance, it was indeed a very arduous process! But the workers are never afraid of hardship. As soon as they get off work, the actors and set designers run to the club to work. During the "May 1st" rush performance, rehearsals often went on until twelve o'clock at night. Production was not delayed during the day. The workers encouraged each other with the words "Now it's not just about having fun, but about serving the masses."
　　The work process is a process of learning and transformation
    Every play performed by the troupe, from creation to rehearsal to performance, is a collective work process. At the same time, it is also a learning and transformation process for everyone. Especially in the difficult problems discovered in the work, for example: one worker is always very enthusiastic about his work, but when he sees others not observing time during rehearsals, he gets anxious. Later, when he was directing the opera "New Attitude," he learned to slowly persuade and encourage everyone's emotions to carry out the rehearsal well when some people were late or the play was not rehearsed well. At the same time, he also felt that "losing your temper is always not as good as not losing it." When "New Attitude" was performed, he excitedly said: "I really learned a lot from rehearsing this play. In terms of the cultivation of leadership skills, it really gave me a lot of exercise!" At the same time, he also reviewed the problem that he was not confident enough when difficulties occurred in his work: like at first, he felt it was difficult to correct many bad actions when worker Zhang Xinglong performed the opera, but when this shortcoming was told to Lao Zhang, Lao Zhang practiced as soon as he got off work, and in just a few days, he performed very well, and the role played by Lao Zhang won the satisfaction and praise of the audience. In the face of such facts, the staff realized that "as long as you can have the determination to overcome difficulties: everything can be done well."
　　Listen to the opinions of the masses
    Growing up with the help of the masses
    Since its establishment, this troupe has generated and corrected many ideological and viewpoint problems during the performance process: the first time it performed four dramas: "Being the Masters of Our Own House," "Coal Mining," "Before and After Registration," and "Model Couple." These plays were all collectively created by the workers. Everyone was very happy when writing and rehearsing, but after the performance, because they were short plays, they were over in less than an hour. So I heard a lot of feedback from the masses: some said, "What's the point of watching workers perform? I see it every day when I go to the factory." Some said, "The troupe is not good anymore, it can't perform plays like 'Thunderstorm' anymore!" At this time, the people in the troupe's thoughts fluctuated! Some people felt "not interested in performing short plays," and some felt "it's better to perform old plays 'Wu Jia Po' and 'Three Fears Wife,' the audience likes to watch them!" Some people were not convinced, "Is it because we didn't perform well? Why are the audience willing to watch the cultural troupe's plays?" In addition, some viewers put forward many valuable suggestions for improvement, and the workers immediately studied and changed them after hearing them. The audience satisfactorily criticized the troupe and said: "Your troupe is so good, no matter who makes a suggestion, as long as it is correct, you will modify it immediately." They can humbly learn from the masses, so they can also improve their work and be welcomed by the masses.
    During "May 1st," the opera "New Attitude" was performed. At this time, the troupe already had its own band, and many workers who had never sung before became opera actors! Especially after the audience gave warm applause for the first performance, it brought great excitement and encouragement to the workers! At the same time, it corrected the thoughts of "not interested in performing short plays" and "not as good as performing old plays..." The workers happily said, "Looking back, it's much more progressive than the last two performances!" Especially after the performance, after hearing a lot of encouragement and feedback from the masses, on the one hand, they worked hard to correct shortcomings such as unclear singing... on the other hand, they humbly believed that performing this play was just "taking the first bite of watermelon, only tasted the sweetness," and we must work hard in the future! On the 9th and 10th of this month, they participated in the performance of the Cultural Congress with the opera "New Attitude."
    This troupe is constantly progressing and growing with the help and encouragement of the masses.

### 石景山钢铁厂的职工业余剧团

　　石景山钢铁厂的
  　职工业余剧团
    雁军
    石景山钢铁厂职工业余剧团的前身是青联话剧团。它是厂内一些爱好戏剧的职工们自己组织起来的。过去曾演过一些话剧，大的如“雷雨”“裙带风”等。在灯光的装置，布景，化妆的各种技术上都已有它一定的基础。
    解放了，大家都高兴了！庆祝第一个解放新年时，剧团星夜赶排了话剧“抓壮丁”，没演过剧的工友们也都想演演剧：于是在新年除了闹秧歌外，工友们又自动组织起来，自编自导自演，演出小话剧“谁和咱是一家人”、“爱芦工厂”“反对假和平活报”。在这一时期钢铁厂文娱活动上形成一个澎湃的热潮，也可以说从解放后头一个新年开始，在钢铁厂文艺运动上展开了新的一页。
    在工人群众要求下，职工筹备会文教部的号召下，几天的工夫报名的团员便达七十以上，“石景山钢铁厂职工业余剧团”便正式成立了。
　　自编、自演，演自己的事情，自己教育自己。
    “自编、自演，演自己的事情，自己教育自己。”在剧团成立大会的标语上这样写着，这是剧团的工作方针，也是全体团员的信心。剧团成立了，第一个重要工作是写剧本，正如一个工友说“剧本就象发动机一样，它不动别的部门都动不起来”，所以第一步工作就是动员大批的团员，会写的，不会写的都参加了编剧小组。
    怎么写？有的说“咱们从日本在时开始写起，写到国民党来怎样剥削压迫咱们，一直写到现在怎样解放，怎样生产……”有的说“太长了！那得写多少幕？咱们得象小孩走路一样，一步一步的来！”还是写小的好。接着就是写什么？开始大家先讲解放后工厂有那些新鲜事？就象讲故事一样。如谈到工厂在清点运动的时候，怎样提出“不漏一针一线”，有的就具体谈起“××顶着小雨推车子到处拣破铁管子，交给工厂”有的接着就说“××交出了过去偷工厂的东西，人家是自动的交给清点委员的”提起一个头，大家就滔滔不断的接着发展下去。把这件事情按各厂不同情况把它充实起来，就产生了主题。谈到人物，有的工友就高兴的一边谈一边比划，写那个人的声音、动作、口头语等等。故事凑的差不多了，每个人便按着自己愿意写哪一类内容的剧本参加到哪一个小组去。
    写作方法有很多种，有的是一个人先写，然后叫大家提意见。有的是一边写一边就和大伙讨论着修改。例如池北村工人宿舍小组，写“当家作主人”的时候，就是第二种办法。编剧是这样，导演也是这样：一个人作戏，大家看，有时演剧一个动作很好，底下的人就喊“好！保留！”有时演员表演得不象时，当观众的工友就跑上去“来，我试试你看看”，等他作完了，演员看了以后再重作。也有的是先记住哪点不好，等排演完了再谈。总之，无论是哪一种方式，都是贯彻着集体学习集体创作的精神。
    从开始到演出，底确是一个很艰苦的过程！但是工友们是从来不怕苦的。一下班演员和作布景工作的便跑到俱乐部来工作。如“五一”突击演出时往往排到夜里十二点。白天照旧不耽误生产。工友们都是以“现在不光是玩玩乐乐，是要为群众服务”这句话，来互相勉励的。
　　工作过程就是学习与改造过程
    在剧团所演出的每一个剧，从创作排演到演出，都是集体的工作过程。同时也就是每个人的学习与改造过程。尤其是在工作中所发现的困难问题上，例如：一个工友工作总是很热心，可是当他一看到别人排戏不遵守时间时就好发急。后来在排演“新态度”歌剧时，他作的是导演工作，有的人因为别人来晚了或者戏排不好发急时，他也学会了慢慢劝解，鼓励大家情绪来很好的进行排戏。同时他也感到“发脾气总不如不发上算”。当“新态度”演出时，他兴奋的说：“排这个戏，我真学习不少东西。在作领导工作的修养上，真给我锻炼不小！”同时也检讨到过去对工作一发生困难就信心不够强的毛病：象最初对工友张兴隆演歌剧很多不好的动作纠正不了感到困难，可是当这个缺点告诉老张以后，老张一下班就练习，仅仅几天的工夫就很好的演出了，并且老张演的角色博得观众的满意与好评。在这样的事实面前，使工作人员认识到“只要能有克服困难的决心：一切都能做好。”
　　听取群众意见
    在群众帮助下成长
    这个剧团从成立以来，在演出过程中曾经产生和纠正了很多思想和观点问题：第一次演出四个话剧：“当家作主人”“挖煤”“登记前后”“模范夫妇”这些剧都是工友们集体创作的。大家在写的时候，排的时候都非常高兴，可是一演出因为是小剧，不到一个钟头就演完了。于是听到了很多群众反映：有的说“表演工人有什么看头，爱看到工厂里去天天看”，有的说“剧团不行了，再也演不出象‘雷雨’那样剧了！”这时在剧团的人们思想就波动起来！有的人感到“演小剧不起劲”，有的感到“还不如演旧戏‘武家坡’‘三怕妻’观众爱看呢！”有的就不服气“还是咱们演的不好，观众为什么愿意看文工团的戏呢？”另外有些观众提出很多宝贵的改进意见，工友们听到后马上自动研究把它改过来。观众曾满意的批评剧团说：“你们这个剧团这样好，不管谁提的意见，只要提的对就马上修改。”他们能向群众虚心学习，所以也就能改进自己工作，得到群众的欢迎。
    “五一”时演出歌剧“新态度”，这时剧团已经有了自己的乐队，而且很多过去没唱过歌的工友，都成了歌剧演员！尤其在第一次出演，观众送以热烈的掌声以后，给工友们带来莫大的兴奋与鼓励！同时纠正了“演小剧不起劲”和“不如演旧戏……”的思想。工友们高兴地说“回头看看，是比上两次演的剧进步多了！”尤其在演完以后，听到很多群众鼓励与反映以后，他们一方面努力纠正唱词不清……等缺点，一方面又很虚心的认为演出这个剧只是“头一口咬西瓜，才尝到甜味”，以后还得好好干！本月九、十两日，他们曾以歌剧“新态度”参加了文代大会的演出。
    这个剧团就是这样不断地在群众帮助与鼓励下进步与成长的。
