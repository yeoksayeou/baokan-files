Road Maintenance Fees Adjusted Based on Millet Price
  North China Railway Bureau Notifies Subordinates to Implement
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China Highway Transportation Bureau, in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Collecting Road Maintenance Fees for Rubber-Tired Vehicles on Highways in the North China Region" as stipulated in the North China People's Government's Secret General Order No. 4 issued on April 23rd of this year, collects road maintenance fees for rubber-tired vehicles. The monthly fee for a single-axle vehicle is 25 jin of millet, 40 jin for a double-axle vehicle, and 55 jin for a triple-axle vehicle, all calculated at a rate of 20 People's Currency per jin of millet. Now, due to high commodity prices, the above regulations are no longer suitable for road maintenance project applications. Upon order, adjustments have been made, changing the rate to 40 People's Currency per jin of millet. The adjusted fee rates are: 1,000 People's Currency per month (25 jin of millet) for a single-axle vehicle, 1,600 People's Currency per month (40 jin of millet) for a double-axle vehicle, and 2,200 People's Currency per month (55 jin of millet) for a triple-axle vehicle. The bureau has notified its various management stations and provinces (administrative offices) to implement these measures separately.

　　征收公路养路费按小米折价调整
  　华北路局通知所属施行
    【本报讯】华北公路运输总局，根据华北人民政府本年四月廿三日秘总字第四号布告“华北区公路征收汽车胶皮轮大车养路费暂行办法”之规定，征收胶皮轮大车养路费，单套车每月征收小米二十五斤，双套车四十斤，三套车五十五斤，均按每斤小米折合人民券二十元计收。现以物价高涨，上项规定已不适于护养工程应用，奉令调整，改按每斤小米折合人民券四十元计收。其调整费率为单套车每月征收（小米二十五斤）一千元，双套车每月征收（小米四十斤）一千六百元，三套车每月征收（小米五十五斤）二千二百元。已经通知该局各管理所站及各省（行署）分别实施。
