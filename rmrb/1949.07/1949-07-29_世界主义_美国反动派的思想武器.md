　　Cosmopolitanism
  　An Ideological Weapon of American Reactionaries
    Translated from the April 7th issue of Pravda
    The propagation of bourgeois cosmopolitanism occupies a prominent place in the arsenal of tactical means employed by imperialist reactionaries. Under the banner of cosmopolitanism, American imperialism tries every means to establish its world domination.

　　(1)
    So, what is cosmopolitanism?
    The word "cosmopolitan" is transliterated from Greek and means a citizen of the world. Cosmopolitanism is the advocacy of so-called "world citizens," advocating the abandonment of any nationality, and propagating the eradication of national traditions and cultures under the guise of creating a "global" and "universal" culture. Cosmopolitanism does not recognize the particularities of nations formed in the course of evolution and history; it negates national interests, national independence, and the national sovereignty of all nations.

    From its inception to the present day, cosmopolitanism has been and still is an ideological weapon used by the exploiting classes to justify and conceal their predatory policies. Cosmopolitanism has reached its peak of development in the capitalist era, becoming an ideological cloak to hide the bourgeoisie's policies aimed at plundering foreign territories, new colonies, and markets.

    Cosmopolitanism is the reverse side of bourgeois nationalism. When Marx and Engels exposed the representatives of German "True Socialism," they wrote: "... we can be sure that on the basis of the Germans' utopian collectivism and cosmopolitanism, there exists a narrow nationalistic point of view!" (Complete Works of Marx and Engels, Russian edition, Vol. IV, p. 464). In the era of imperialism—the highest and final stage of capitalism—this organic connection between nationalism and cosmopolitanism is particularly evident. "Imperialism," Lenin wrote, "means that capital is developing beyond the limits of national states; it marks the expansion and intensification of national oppression on a new historical basis." (Complete Works of Lenin, Russian edition, Vol. XXI, pp. 371-372). Clearly, the imperialist bourgeoisie, depending on the specific circumstances, either dons the cloak of overt nationalism or disguises itself with cosmopolitan ideas to implement its aggressive, chauvinistic policies. Cosmopolitanism is a screen for the modern bourgeoisie, behind which hides imperialism's attempts to plunder and rob, enslave other nations, suppress revolutionary movements, provoke new world wars, and establish world domination by this or that imperialist country. World domination is the content of imperialist politics, and imperialist war is the continuation of this politics.

    The imperialists are not concerned with the patriotism of the masses or with the national interests of the people; they only care about their own wallets. For this, they shamelessly sell out and betray national interests, and are prepared to sacrifice the independence of their own countries in order to oppress the working people. Marx pointed out that the bourgeoisie's patriotism "... since its financial, commercial, and industrial activities have taken on a cosmopolitan character, has degenerated into pure hypocrisy." (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Russian edition, Vol. III, p. 355). The bourgeoisie merely uses the concept of the motherland itself to deceive the masses and conceal its dirty and greedy conspiracies.

    After the Second World War, cosmopolitanism, as the ideological cloak of imperialist reactionaries, has further armed Wall Street and its spokesmen. The role of corrupt cosmopolitanism has never been so clearly and openly exposed. It is precisely because of this that the American ruling clique, putting the struggle for world domination on the agenda, holds high the shield of cosmopolitanism as the most suitable form to promote its aggressive and expansionist plans, to oppose the growing strength of socialism and global democracy, and to oppose the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

    Under today's conditions, cosmopolitanism is the ideology of American world domination, the ideology of oppressing the freedom and independence of nations—large and small—and the ideology of colonizing Europe—and not only Europe.

    The thinkers of American monopoly capitalists and their lackeys in the right-wing socialist parties try their best to undermine the concepts of national sovereignty and national independence; they vilify these concepts as decadent, demanding that they be discarded into the dustbin of history, because the people should supposedly abandon their own national interests and traditions, and betray their national dignity.

    For example, the Washington "Star" is propagating precisely this view. In its February 6th issue, in discussing the North Atlantic Treaty, it considered it the first step in creating a "United States of Europe," expressed satisfaction that the British "have significantly eliminated their pride," and at the same time called on the European people to "forget national pride."

    Of course, the lackeys of American imperialism are always doing everything possible to praise the "American way of life," falsely claiming that the American system is the "highest model" of democracy, and describing Americans as representatives of the "highest race," destined to rule all other nations. Lynching courts; the atrocities of the Ku Klux Klan; the odious discrimination against thirteen million Black people; and the fascist "achievements" of the so-called Un-American Activities Committee—all of this is considered a "manifestation of advanced civilization." Corrupt bourgeois civilization can give humanity nothing other than extreme reactionism, hatred of mankind, and bestial chauvinism.

    The thinkers of imperialist reactionaries shamelessly describe the aggressive policies of the American ruling clique and their desire to enslave people as a "legitimate" historical movement, as a "command" of historical necessity.

    This propaganda has received the full support of the European bourgeoisie, whose countries have been subjected to the dictates of American imperialists. Reactionary politicians, commentators, sociologists, philosophers, and leaders of right-wing social democratic parties—all the dark forces of the capitalist world—compete in this dark undertaking, attempting to use the propagation of cosmopolitanism to break down the people's will to resist American aggression.

    Having put the people in the desperate situation of the North Atlantic Treaty, which is aimed against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and at the same time making many countries economically, politically, and militarily dependent on American monopoly capitalists through the "Marshall Plan," the preachers of American world domination proclaim at every crossroads that the people should forget their right to national independence. The purpose of this propaganda is to conceal the betrayal of the national interests of their countries by bourgeois governments and their lackeys in the right-wing social democratic parties. This new betrayal is manifested in the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. The statement of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs states: "Behind this treaty, there exists not only the aggressive clique of American rulers, not only their American echoes such as Churchill and Bevin, but also many other smaller instigators of war."

    The propagation of cosmopolitan ideas is becoming increasingly widespread in European bourgeois countries. For example, in Britain, sometimes somewhere, "scholars and philosophers" gather to vilify all patriotism as "idol worship," and sometimes "writers" employed by imperialist reactionaries point out in thick volumes that the main enemy on the ideological front is patriotism.

    The ideologues of cosmopolitanism, attempting to turn black and white upside down, portray themselves as warriors against nationalism, hypocritically calling all those who fight for national sovereignty and uphold the political, economic, and cultural independence of the state and people as nationalists. At the same time, some of them maliciously declare that "economic nationalism" must be smashed, while they mean to insinuate the economic autonomy of the state and nation. Others oppose "nationalist ideas," which refers to the right of all nations to demand national independence.

    In fact, all defenders of cosmopolitanism are the most rabid and aggressive nationalist preachers of American and British imperialism. It goes without saying that all extreme reactionaries, especially the remnants of German fascism, have found refuge in Britain and the United States. The ideologues of imperialism are welcoming the Tito traitor group, which has embarked on the path of bourgeois nationalism. In order to destroy the democratic and anti-imperialist camp, they are giving all possible assistance to any manifestation of bourgeois nationalism that flows into the muddy stream of Anglo-American imperialist aggressive politics.

    It is clear that the loyal servants of the bourgeoisie—the right-wing social democrats, all those Blums, Lynes, and Schumachers—are particularly active on the stage of cosmopolitanism. Thus, Charles Lynes, the leader of the Austrian right-wing social democratic party, asserted: "Technological progress has now begun to destroy the foundations of the nation-state." In order to create the appearance of arguments favorable to rabid cosmopolitanism, Lynes accumulated one lie after another. Lynes asserted: "The palaces of national culture have been completely shattered." At the same time, he also predicted the demise of national literature, because, you see, literature has now become cosmopolitan. Obviously, there is indeed no, nor can there be, a literature that does not belong to a nation. World literature is created only by the treasures of all nations. But how distorted is this issue by this American imperialist lackey Lynes!

    The bourgeois cosmopolitans spread nauseating flattery to the United States, shamelessly asserting that American expansion is a means of spreading advanced culture. The German fascists also knew very well that they could not subdue the people without destroying their national consciousness. It was precisely the fascists who tried every means to spiritually disarm the nation. Today's cosmopolitans frankly admit that the Hitlerites were following a "historical command" and cultivating their ugly "new order"; and now Anglo-American imperialists are also destined to realize this "historical command." The modern ideologues of bourgeois cosmopolitanism are creating the same evils as those created by the ideologues of Hitlerism.

　　(3)
    Cosmopolitans raise the shield for those who have betrayed the interests of the people and all kinds of quislings serving the United States, praising all traitors, capitulators, and defectors who have forgotten their motherland, shamelessly declaring them to be "progressive" people. It is easy to understand that the specialized traitors and betrayers in those anti-people political parties and groups who have turned to serve American espionage are causing the American "cosmopolitans" to be ecstatic.

    Wall Street has gathered all this group of rogues around itself, attempting to create a "desire" to establish various "European federations," "United States of Europe," etc. in the Marshallized countries, thus proposing a dreamlike plan to create a so-called "world government," "supranational government," or "world state," which should subject all peoples and all countries to it and dissolve them within it.

    Not only sociologists, political commentators, and writers, but even the leading figures of the United States and Britain are talking about this. Jessep, the official representative of the United States to the United Nations, openly stated that the result of the North Atlantic Treaty is the creation of a "world government." Churchill, one of the most famous propagandists for the creation of the "United States of Europe" and a vile warmonger, believes that the United States and Britain, "can later produce the principle of common nationality."

    When commenting on the role of the North Atlantic Treaty in creating the "United States of Europe," the "Star," which we mentioned earlier, frankly admitted: "The United States is of course the cornerstone of this building," and admitted that when this alliance is established, the borders between European countries, "will ultimately not be of greater significance than they are in the United States."

    The British philosopher, the extreme reactionary Russell, wrote straightforwardly that when talking about a "world state" and a "supranational government," one should understand the world domination of American imperialism. As Huxley wrote, the most important step on the road to establishing a "world government" is to establish a very powerful monopoly atomic trust under the control of the United States, and to use this trust to seize the deposits of uranium and radium mines throughout the earth.

    Scholars-servants of British imperialism declare that the technical aspects of the "world government" have already been revealed in the state institutions of the British Empire. Therefore, the only problem is to turn all independent countries into dominions and colonies of British imperialism.

    Conversely, American imperialist ideologues declare that the United States is the model of the "world government," and the only problem is to turn all independent nations and countries into the status of states like Texas or Utah.

    The "theorists" of bourgeois international law, completely based on the orders of Wall Street to study the theory of cosmopolitanism, are trying to prove that the subject of international law is not the state, but the individual. So, according to this theory, neither the sovereignty of the state and nation, nor the right of nationality and patriotic obligations, exist. What exists is only a group of "individuals" and "world citizens" who are arbitrarily slaughtered by the United States.

    In order to defend the ambition of the United States to dominate the world, Kern—one of the lone and helpless preachers of cosmopolitanism—slanders nations, writing: "There are some colorless races and colorless nations, who do not have a clear path in life." Targeting this kind of "colorless nation," Kern praised the "excellent" nation in the old fascist style. Among these nations, "certain general human characteristics have gained special development," that is to say: the nation is "cosmopolitan" by its nature, and therefore seems to be destined to play a dominant role. This is the latest racial theory aimed at serving the interests of American imperialists.

    Only the working class, led by its communist vanguard, is carrying out a thorough struggle to win national sovereignty and oppose the imperialist bandits who mutilate national freedom and independence.

    The working people abroad have found a tested leader, the Communist Party, in the fight against the all-round expansion and aggression plans of imperialism. The Communist Party concentrates its efforts on the basis of the anti-imperialist and democratic program, and gathers all the democratic and patriotic forces of all nations around itself.

    The Anglo-American imperialists' plan to deceive the people with the mask of cosmopolitanism has not succeeded. The vigorous growth of the national liberation movement of the oppressed peoples of Asia and Europe, who are fighting against imperialism for independence and freedom, proves this.

　　(4)
    The Bolshevik Party, throughout its entire course of activity, has resolutely fought and is still fighting against bourgeois nationalism, against the slightest manifestations of cosmopolitanism, and against all kinds of national nihilism. Lenin and Stalin taught us that international culture is not without nationality.

    Our great leaders have tirelessly educated the Soviet people with love for the socialist motherland and with vigorous Soviet patriotism. The working class's and the working people's love for their own country is organically combined with internationalism and with respect for the rights and freedoms of other nations. Comrade Stalin pointed out what the idea of Soviet national friendship is and what is the impassable abyss between proletarian internationalism and bourgeois nationalism: "The Soviet people believe that every nation—no matter how large or small—is the same, has its own characteristics, and has characteristics that belong only to them and are not available to other nations. These characteristics are the contribution that each nation brings to the total treasure of world culture, enriching it and enriching it."

    In accordance with the instructions of Lenin and Stalin, the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet people are carrying out a resolute struggle against foreign flattery, against bourgeois nationalism, and cosmopolitanism. This struggle is of great significance to all democratic and anti-imperialist camps. In this struggle, Marxist-Leninist theory is a powerful spiritual weapon, which often exposes national chauvinism, as well as national nihilism and bourgeois cosmopolitanism. In this struggle, the theory on the national question created by Lenin and Stalin is the sharpest weapon.

    In contrast to bourgeois nationalism, chauvinism, and the bourgeois contempt for other nations; in contrast to the view that requires the abandonment of national states and independence—this is a characteristic of modern imperialist bourgeois thought—Soviet thought is the idea of developing Soviet patriotism and national friendship, the idea of proletarian internationalism, and the idea of national freedom and equality; is the struggle for the development of national creativity, the struggle for the real spiritual treasure of mankind, against the suffocating force of decadent bourgeois culture.

    The imperialists of the United States and Britain and their voluntary or involuntary agents, prostrating themselves before the bourgeois culture that is beginning to decay, attempt, by means of cosmopolitan propaganda, to reduce the role of the great Russian people, to insult the brilliant achievements of socialism in the Soviet Union, to weaken Soviet patriotism and friendship between nationalities, to destroy the Soviet people's will to strive to enhance the power of the Soviet state, and to shake the confidence of building communism in our country. However, the lone and helpless cosmopolitans have been resolutely exposed in our country, and at the same time have been nailed to the cross.

    Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and under the guidance of the great Stalin, the Soviet people have created the most advanced social system and state system in the world, the most advanced culture—Soviet culture, which is national in form and socialist in content. The victory of socialism in our country has inspired all progressive people in the struggle against capitalism, which has begun to decay. At the same time, the people's democratic countries that have embarked on the path of socialist construction are learning from the rich experience of the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet people, achieving new and new victories, are realizing the transition from socialism to communism. In achieving these many victories, the great Russian people, led by the world's most revolutionary Russian proletariat under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin's Party, have played a decisive role.

    The Soviet Union—is a fortress of advanced culture, a fortress of civilization, and a reliable pillar of freedom, democracy, and lasting peace between nations.

### 世界主义　美国反动派的思想武器

　　世界主义
  　美国反动派的思想武器
    译自四月七日真理报  君强译  曹汀校
    资产阶级世界主义的宣传，在帝国主义反动派所应用的策略手段的各种武库里，占有很显著的地位。美帝国主义在世界主义旗帜下，千方百计地企图建立其世界统治。
　　（一）
    那末世界主义是什么呢？
    “世界主义者”这个字，是从希腊文转译而来，是世界公民之义。世界主义，就是宣传所谓“世界公民”，宣传放弃任何国籍，在创造“世界的”、“全人类的”文化的屏障下，宣传根绝民族的传统与各民族的文化。世界主义不承认各民族在进化中在历史上所构成的特殊性；否定民族的利益，民族独立及各民族的国家主权。
    世界主义从自己的发生到今天，它曾是，并且现在也是剥削者阶级用以辩护及隐蔽他们掠夺性政策的思想武器。世界主义在资本主义时代已达到它发展的最高峰，成为隐藏资产阶级旨在掠夺外国领土、新殖民地及市场的政策的思想外衣。
    世界主义是资产阶级民族主义的背面。马克思和恩格斯揭露德国“真正社会主义”的代表时，曾写道：“…我们又能确信：在德国人的空想的全体主义及世界主义基础上，是存在着多么狭义的民族主义观点呢！”（马恩全集俄文版，第四册四六四页）。在帝国主义时代——资本主义最高和最后阶段中，民族主义与世界主义这个有机的连系尤其明显了。“帝国主义——列宁写道——就是意味着资本的发展超出民族国家的范围，它标志着民族压迫在新的历史基础上的扩张与尖锐化”。（列宁全集俄文版二十一册，三七一页——三七二页）。很明显地，帝国主义资产阶级，随着具体情况，或披着公开的民族主义的外衣或以世界主义思想为掩护，实现其侵略的沙文主义的政策。世界主义对于现代资产阶级是一种屏障，在这后面隐藏着帝国主义实行掠夺和抢劫，奴役其他民族，压迫革命运动，挑拨新的世界战争，建立这个或那个帝国主义国家的世界统治等等的企图。世界统治是帝国主义政治的内容，帝国主义战争，就是这一政治的继续。
    帝国主义者与人民大众的爱国主义无关，与人民的全民利益无关，他们只关心自己的钱包。为了这个，他们无耻的出卖与背叛民族利益，并且为了压迫劳动人民，准备丧失自己国家的独立。马克思曾指出：资产阶级的爱国主义“……自从其财政的、商业的和工业的活动带有世界主义的性质以后，就退化成为纯粹的伪善。”（马恩文选俄文版。三册三五五页）。资产阶级只是利用祖国这个概念本身来欺骗群众，掩饰其污秽的贪欲的阴谋。
　　（二）
    第二次世界大战结束后，世界主义作为帝国主义反动派之思想外衣，进而武装华尔街及其代言人，腐败的世界主义的作用，还从未如此明显露骨过。正是因为如此，美国统治集团才把争取世界统治置于议事日程，高举世界主义的盾牌，做为最适宜的形式来宣传其侵略及扩张计划，来反对社会主义及全世界民主主义日益增长的力量，反对苏联及人民民主国家。
    在今天的条件下，世界主义是美国统治全世界的思想，是压迫民族——大小民族——之自由及独立的思想，是使欧洲——不仅欧洲——殖民地化的思想。
    美国独占资本家的思想家及其右翼社会主义的奴仆，尽力破坏民族主权及民族独立的概念；他们侮蔑这个概念为腐朽的，要求弃之于历史垃圾箱中，因为人民似乎应该放弃自己民族的利益及传统，应该背叛自己的民族尊严。
    例如，华盛顿的“星报”，就正是用这种观点来宣传。在二月六日的一期上，谈到北大西洋公约时，它认为那是创建“欧洲合众国”之第一步，对英国人“显著地消灭了自己的骄傲”表示满意，同时它还号召欧洲人民“忘掉民族的骄傲”。
    当然，美帝国主义的走卒们，总是千方百计赞扬“美国的生活方式”，诬称美国制度为民主的“最高模范”，多方描写美国人为“最高种族”的代表，是命定来统治其他一切民族的。私刑法庭；三Ｋ党之兽行；一千三百万黑人的可憎的差别待遇；以及所谓反美活动委员会的法西斯的“业绩”——所有这一切，都被认为是“高级文明的表现”。腐败的资产阶级文明，除了极端的反动主义，对人类的憎恨和兽性的沙文主义外，不能给与人类任何其他的东西。
    帝国主义反动派的思想家恬不知耻地把美国统治集团的侵略方针和他们奴役人民的愿望描写为“合法的”历史运动，为历史必然的“命令”。
    这种宣传，获得了使自己国家受美国帝国主义者宰割的欧洲各国资产阶级的完全支持。反动的政治家、评论家、社会学家、哲学家及右翼社会党的领袖们——一切资本主义世界的黑暗势力，在这个黑暗的事业里竞赛，企图借助世界主义之宣传，以分解人民反抗美国侵略的意志。
    把人民陷于以反对苏联及人民民主国家为目的的北大西洋公约的绝境里，同时借“马歇尔计划”使许多国家在经济、政治及军事上都依赖于美国独占资本家，美国世界统治的布道者们，在一切十字街头宣称：人民应该忘记自己的民族独立权。这一宣传底目的就是在于掩饰资产阶级政府及其右翼社会党的奴仆们背叛其国家民族利益。这一新的背叛即表现在北大西洋公约的签署。在苏联外交部声明书中写道：“在这个公约的背后，不仅存在着美国统治侵略集团，不仅有其美国的应声虫邱吉尔、贝文之流，也还有不少其他较小的战争煽动者”。
    世界主义思想的宣传，在欧洲资产阶级国家内愈来愈广泛了。例如，在英国，时而某处聚集起“学者及哲学家”，污蔑一切爱国主义是“偶像的崇拜”，时而为帝国主义反动派所雇用的“作家”，在厚厚的巨册中，指出思想战线上的主要敌人是爱国主义。
    世界主义的思想家，企图颠倒黑白把自己描写成为反对民族主义的勇士，伪善的把所有争取民族主权及拥护国家和人民政治、经济及文化独立的人，都称作是民族主义者。同时他们中间一些人恶意宣称：必须粉碎“经济的民族主义”，而他们的意思却是暗指国家和民族的经济自主。另外一些人则反对“民族主义思想”，而这又是指各民族要求民族独立的权利。
    事实上，一切世界主义的辩护人，都是美英帝国主义者最狂暴的侵略的民族主义的布道者，不用说，一切极端反动分子，尤其是德国法西斯主义残余分子，在英美找到了隐蔽所。帝国主义的思想家正在欢迎已走上了资产阶级民族主义道路的铁托叛卖集团。为要摧毁民主及反帝阵营，他们对于流入英美帝国主义侵略政治浊流中的任何资产阶级民族主义的表现，均给予一切可能的帮助。
    很显然的，资产阶级的忠实奴仆——右派社会党人，所有这些勃鲁姆、林尼尔、舒马赫之辈，是特殊热心地活跃在世界主义舞台之上。所以奥地利右派社会党领袖查理士·林尼尔断言：“技术的进步现在已开始摧毁了民族国家的基础。”林尼尔，为了创造有利于狂暴的世界主义之论据的外形，积累了一个又一个的谎言。林尼尔断言：“民族文化的宫殿，已全面破碎了。”同时他还预告民族文学的灭亡，因为你不是看见吗，文学现在已变成世界性的了。显然，确实没有，也不可能有不隶属于民族的文学，世界文学只是由一切民族宝藏创造起来的。但是，这位美帝奴仆林尼尔却是怎样地歪曲了这个问题啊！
    资产阶级的世界主义者传布着对美国可厌的阿谀，他们无耻地断言：美国的扩张是传布高等文化的手段。德国法西斯恰巧也曾经知道得很清楚：不摧毁人民的民族自觉，是不能使他们服从自己的。就正是法西斯分子曾想尽一切方法在精神上解除民族的武装。今天的世界主义者坦白地承认：希特勒分子曾遵从“历史的命令”，培植自己丑恶的“新秩序”；而现在英美帝国主义者也注定要实现这个“历史的命令”。资产阶级世界主义的现代思想家们，创造了同样的恶迹，象希特勒主义的思想家所曾创造的一样。
　　（三）
    世界主义者替背叛了人民利益的人们及各种服役于美帝的吉斯林之辈举起了盾牌，赞美一切忘记了祖国的卖国贼、投降者和叛变分子，无耻地把他们宣布为“前进的”人们。很容易了解，那些转而替美国间谍服务的反人民的政治党派及集团中的专门叛徒和卖国贼们，正引起了美国“世界主义者”的狂喜。
    华尔街把所有这一群流氓集聚在自己的周围，企图在马歇尔化的国家中造成一种建立各种各样“欧洲联邦”、“欧洲合众国”等的“热望”，于是提一种梦呓计划来创造所谓“世界政府”，“超民族的政府”或“世界国家”，它应当使一切人民和一切国家服从于它并溶化于其中。
    不仅社会学家、政论家、文学家甚至美英之领导人物，都在谈论着这件事。美国驻联合国之官方代表耶塞普曾公开地声明：北大西洋公约的结果是创设“世界政府”。最著名的宣传创设“欧洲合众国”者之一的卑鄙的战争贩子邱吉尔，认为美英两国，“以后可以产生出来共同国籍底原则。”
    我们曾提起过的“星报”于评论北大西洋公约在创造“欧洲合众国”中所起的作用时，曾坦白地承认：“美国当然是这个建筑物的基石”，并且承认：在这一联盟成立时，欧洲各国间的国境线，“归根结底也不会比较它们在美国所有的意义为大。”
    英国哲学家，极端反动主义者拉塞尔率直地写道：谈到“世界国家”和“超民族的政府”，就应当了解美帝国主义的世界统治。正如哈克斯利所写的，在建立“世界政府”道路上最重要的一个步骤，即是设立在美国控制下的极强大的独占的原子托拉斯，并用此托拉斯来攫夺整个地球上的铀和镭矿底贮藏。
    英帝御用学者—奴仆们宣称，“世界政府”之技术方面已经在不列颠帝国的国家机构中现露出来了。因之问题只在于使一切独立国家变成不列颠帝国主义之自治领及殖民地。
    相反地，美帝的思想家却声明说：美国是“世界政府”的楷模，问题只在于使一切独立民族和国家变成如得克萨斯或犹他州之地位。
    资产阶级的国际法“理论家”，完全依据华尔街的命令来研究世界主义之理论，他们企图证明国际法的主体不是国家，而是个人。那么，依据这一理论，无论国家及民族的主权，或是国籍权及爱国义务，就都不存在了。存在的只有一群被美帝任意宰割的“个人”及“世界公民”。
    为了辩护美帝统治世界的妄图，克恩——孤寡无亲的世界主义的布道者之一——诽谤民族，他写道：“有一些无色人种和无色民族，他们没有明确的生活道路”。针对着这种“无色民族”克恩按照法西斯老作风颂扬“优秀”的民族。在这些民族中，“某些一般人类的特性，获得了特殊的发展”，即是说：民族按照其本性是“世界主义”的，因此似乎是被命定充当统治角色的。这就是旨在服务于美国帝国主义者利益的最新的种族理论。
    只有工人阶级，由自己的共产党先锋队领导着，才进行着彻底的斗争，以争取民族主权，反对残害民族自由及独立的帝国主义强盗。
    国外劳苦群众，在反对帝国主义四面八方的扩张及侵略计划时，找到了经过考验的领袖，共产党。共产党在反帝及民主纲领的基础上集中自己的努力，把一切民族的民主爱国力量集聚在自己的周围。
    英美帝国主义者的思想家们，以世界主义的假面具来欺骗人民的计划并没有成功。为反对帝国主义，争取独立与自由而奋斗的欧亚两洲被压迫人民的民族解放运动的勇猛增长，就证明了这件事。
　　（四）
    布尔塞维克党，在自己活动的全部过程中，曾坚决地斗争过，并且现在还在斗争以反对资产阶级的民族主义，反对世界主义的些微表现，反对各种各样的民族虚无主义。列宁和斯大林教导我们，国际文化并不是没有民族性的。
    我们伟大的领袖们，曾孜孜不倦地以对社会主义祖国的热爱，以生气勃勃的苏维埃爱国主义来教育苏维埃人民。工人阶级与劳动者对自己国家的热爱是与国际主义，与对其他民族权利和自由的尊重有机地接合着的。斯大林同志曾指出：苏维埃民族友谊的思想是什么，在无产阶级国际主义与资产阶级的民族主义之间有着怎样无法跨越的深渊：“苏维埃人民认为每个民族—无论大小都是一样，都有自己的特质，都有仅属于他们而不为其他民族所有的特性。这些特性，就是每个民族带到世界文化总宝藏中、使它充实、使它丰富的那个供献。”
    依照列宁和斯大林的指示，布尔塞维克党、苏维埃人民，进行着坚决的斗争以反对媚外，反对资产阶级的民族主义和世界主义。这个斗争对于一切民主的和反帝国主义的阵营，有巨大的意义。在这个斗争里，马列主义理论是强大的精神武器，它经常揭穿民族主义沙文主义，以及民族的虚无主义和资产阶级的世界主义。在这个斗争中，列宁和斯大林所创立的关于民族问题的理论，是最锐利的武器。
    与资产阶级民族主义、沙文主义、资产阶级对其他民族的轻视正相反；与要求放弃民族国家和独立的观点—这是现代帝国主义资产阶级思想的特点—正相反，苏维埃思想，是发展苏维埃爱国主义和民族友谊的思想，是无产阶级国际主义的思想，是民族自由平等的思想；是争取民族创造力的发展，争取人类真正的精神宝藏，反对腐朽的资产阶级文化窒息势力的思想。
    美国和英国的帝国主义者及他们自愿或不自愿的代理人，匍匐于开始腐朽的资产阶级文化面前，企图借助于世界主义的宣传，降低伟大俄罗斯人民的作用，侮蔑社会主义在苏联的辉煌成就，削弱苏维埃爱国主义和民族间的友谊，摧毁苏维埃人民争取增强苏维埃国家威力的意志，动摇在我国建设共产主义的信心。但是，孤寡无亲的世界主义者们，在我国内已被坚决地揭露出来了，同时把它钉上了刑台。
    在布尔塞维克党领导下，在伟大的斯大林指导下，苏维埃人民创造了世界上最先进的社会制度及国家制度，最先进的文化——苏维埃文化，它是民族的形式，社会主义的内容。社会主义在我国的胜利，鼓舞了在反对已开始腐朽的资本主义斗争中一切进步人士。同时已步入社会主义建设道路的人民民主国家，正在学习着苏联的丰富经验。
    苏维埃人民，获得了一切新而又新的胜利，正实现从社会主义到共产主义的过渡。在获得这许多胜利中，伟大的俄罗斯人民，被列宁、斯大林的党领导着的世界上最富革命性的俄罗斯无产阶级，曾起了决定性的作用。
    苏联——是先进文化的堡垒，文明的堡垒，是自由、民主和各民族间持久和平的可靠的支柱。
