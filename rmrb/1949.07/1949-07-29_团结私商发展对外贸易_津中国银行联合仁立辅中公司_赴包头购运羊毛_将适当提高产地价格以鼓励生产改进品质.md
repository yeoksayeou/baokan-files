Unite Private Merchants to Develop Foreign Trade
　　Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China and Renli Fuzhong Company Jointly Go to Baotou to Purchase and Transport Wool
　　Production Area Prices Will Be Appropriately Increased to Encourage Production and Improve Quality
　　[This dispatch from our Tianjin correspondent] In order to promote the export of native products, earn foreign exchange, and expand the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas to develop and improve product transportation and sales, the Bank of China signed a joint contract with Renli and Fuzhong Companies on July 20 to purchase and transport wool in Baotou. The first batch of one million jin has already been purchased. This is a pioneering effort in public-private partnership in foreign exchange business, and will play a significant role in uniting private exporters to expand export trade and further control foreign exchange in the future.

　　The joint business is divided into the following three parts: 1. The Bank of China is responsible for the allocation of acquisition funds. 2. Fuzhong Company is responsible for the acquisition, sorting, transportation, and sales fund allocation work outside the district. 3. After the wool arrives in Tianjin, Renli Company is responsible for warehousing, blending, import and export, and guarantees to pay the Bank of China within the time limit. Judging from the clauses of the contract, this implements the policy of taking into account both public and private interests. For example, if the surplus is less than US$16,000, the Bank of China will only take one-tenth; if it exceeds this amount, it will take two-tenths; if it exceeds US$48,000, it will take three-tenths. This guarantees a certain operating profit for the private sector. In addition, there are specific regulations on the method of acquisition and the acquisition price. Price reduction should not be used for acquisition to harm the interests of the herdsmen. Instead, the price in the production area should be appropriately increased according to the wool classification standards to stimulate herders and wool merchants to automatically improve the quality, such as processing locally to remove soil to save transportation costs. In order to better develop this wool transportation, which was one of the main export products of Tianjin in the past, the Bank of China has sent people to the Datong area to conduct investigations on various acquisition and sales works, and plans to absorb experience and apply it to other public-private cooperative native product export businesses.

　　团结私商发展对外贸易
  　津中国银行联合仁立辅中公司
    赴包头购运羊毛
  　将适当提高产地价格以鼓励生产改进品质
    【本报天津专电】中国银行为促进土产出口争取外汇扩大城乡物资交流以发展和改进产品运销业务，于七月二十日与仁立、辅中两公司签订赴包头购运羊毛组合合同。第一批已收购一百万市斤，这是在外汇业务上公私合营的创举，对今后团结私营出口商以扩大出口贸易及进一步掌握外汇上将起很大作用。
    组合业务分为下列三部分：一、中行负担收购资金调度工作。二、辅中公司担任区外收购、整理、运输及售款调拨工作。三、羊毛运抵天津后入仓、配制、进出口由仁立公司负责，并保证在期限内交款给中行。从合同条文中看，这是贯澈了公私兼顾的政策，如盈余不满一万六千美元时，中行只取十分之一，超过此数取十分之二，超过四万八千美元则取十分之三，这保证了私方一定的经营利润。另外在收购方式及收购价格上亦有具体规定，不应用压价手段来进行收购，以损害牧地人民利益，而根据羊毛分类标准适当的提高产地的价格以刺激牧户和毛商自动的改善品质，如在当地进行加工去土以节省运费，为更好的开展这一过去占津市主要出口土产之一的羊毛外运，中行已派人赴大同一带进行各项收购运销工作的调查，并拟吸收经验运用到其他公私营合作的土产出口事业上去。
