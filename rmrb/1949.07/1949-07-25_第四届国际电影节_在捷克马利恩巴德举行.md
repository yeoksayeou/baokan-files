Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 24th: TASS reports: The spectacular Fourth International Film Festival of 1949 is scheduled to be held in Marienbad, western Czechoslovakia, from July 23rd to August 2nd. The participating countries include the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Germany (Soviet zone), the United States, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and others. It is expected that the most outstanding figures in the global film industry will attend the festival.

The Soviet delegation participating in the International Film Festival, composed of excellent filmmakers and famous actors, led by Shcherbina, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Film Industry, departed for Czechoslovakia on the 20th. This year, the Soviet films to be screened at the International Film Festival include: the films "Meeting on the Elbe," "Michurin" (in color), "Academician Ivan Pavlov," and the first part of "The Battle of Stalingrad"; the full-length documentaries "Vladimir Ilyich Lenin," "May Day in Moscow, 1949" (in color), and "Pushkin"; science and geography films "The Volga River" (in color), "The Story of a Ring," "The Lukewarm Lake," and "In the Deserts of Khorezm"; in addition, there will be two color cartoons.
