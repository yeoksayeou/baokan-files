　　Alkali Soil Improvement Methods
　　Wang Jinchen
　　Alkali soil is found everywhere in Hebei Province, and everyone knows that alkali soil is a great problem for farmers. But what can be done? Now, I will introduce several methods:
　　(1) Washing Method: Dig a water diversion ditch near the alkali soil, and install a sluice gate to divert water into the land, and then dig drainage ditches in the field to allow the water to flow downstream. By diverting and draining water year after year, the alkalinity in the soil will naturally be removed, and the soil quality will become fertile.
　　(2) Soil Importation Method: Shovel away the topsoil containing alkali and add soil that does not contain alkali. This method can be used for small plots of land, such as gardens and vegetable patches.
　　(3) Topsoil Removal Method: Dig up the alkaline topsoil, move it elsewhere, expose the new soil, and then cultivate it. This method is also effective.
　　(4) Deep Ploughing and Sun Exposure Method: Alkali soil is often damp, and air does not circulate easily. Crops do not grow well after sowing. During the rainy season, deep plough several times within three days, expose the soil to the sun, and then drench it with the rain of the "Fu" period. The alkalinity will sink into the lower layer and naturally decrease. However, small rains will cause the alkali in the lower layer to gradually rise along the capillaries, which must be noted.
　　(5) Use of Organic Fertilizers: Organic fertilizers (such as compost, green manure, farmyard manure, and horse manure) can loosen the soil and neutralize the alkalinity in the soil. If applied continuously for years, it can gradually be transformed into fertile land.
　　(6) Use of Acidic Fertilizers: Applying fertilizers such as sulfuric acid, superphosphate, and lime to alkali soil has a neutralizing effect and yields significant results.
　　(7) Selection of Crops with Strong Resistance: It is advisable to select and cultivate crops with strong resistance, such as rice, barley, wheat, oats, sorghum, corn, foxtail millet, sugar beet, cotton, elm, willow, and tamarisk.

　　碱地改良法
    王锦宸
    河北全省到处皆有碱地，谁都知道碱地是农民们的大患。可是有什么办法呢？现在介绍几种办法：
    （一）洗涮法：在碱地附近掘一引水沟，并装置闸板引水灌入地内，更由田内掘排水沟，使之流入于下流，如是引水排水，连年涮洗，地内碱性自然退净，而土质变为肥沃了。
    （二）客土法：将含碱质的表土铲去，加入不含碱质的土壤。此法可用于小块土地。
    如花园菜圃等地是。
    （三）表土铲除法：将有碱性之表土挖掘，移于别处，露出新土，再行耕种，亦见成效。
    （四）深耕日晒法：碱地多湿，空气不易流通，播种后作物发育不良，宜于多雨之期在三日内深耕数次，经日光饱晒，再经伏雨浇透，则碱性沉入下层，自然减少，但遇小雨则反将下层之碱随着细管渐渐上升，是不可不注意的。
    （五）有机质肥料的使用：有机质的肥料（如堆肥、绿肥、厩肥、马粪），皆能使土壤轻松，中和土内的盐基性，如连年施用，渐渐的可使变成良田。
    （六）酸性肥料的使用：碱地如施用硫酸＠、过磷酸、石灰等肥料，有中和作用，收效颇大。
    （七）选择抵抗力强的作物：宜选择栽培抵抗力强的作物，如水稻、大麦、小麦、燕麦、高粱、玉米、粟稗、甜菜、棉花、榆柳、柽柳等。
