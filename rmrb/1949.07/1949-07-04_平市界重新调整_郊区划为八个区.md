　　【This Newspaper News】The People's Government of Beiping City recently received an instruction from the North China People's Government regarding the re-adjustment of the city boundaries of Beiping. A portion of the rural area that has relatively little connection with the city's construction will be respectively assigned to Jizhong and Chahar. In addition, a small part of the Changshun County belonging to Chahar will be placed under the leadership of this city. At the same time, the Suburban Committee of the Municipal Government, in order to facilitate the leadership of various suburban areas, has re-divided the suburbs into eight districts, and also adjusted personnel. It ordered the new and old district chiefs to complete the handover procedures before July 2nd, stipulating that July 2nd is the last date for the original district to use its seal, and July 3rd is the date for the new district to start using its seal.

    The changes in the city boundaries are as follows: (1) Forty-six villages in Huangcun District (i.e., the twenty-fourth district) and four villages in the southern end of Fengtai District, namely Gaojiabao, Gujiazhuang, Lifa, and Efang, a total of fifty villages, are assigned to the tenth administrative region of Jizhong. (2) Twelve villages south of the Gangwa, Wenzhuang, and Daling line in Changxindian are assigned to the Pingxi Administrative Region of Chahar Province. (3) Five villages, including Xibeiwang, Dongbeiwang, Houchang, Fujia Kiln, and Houying, in Changshun County of the Nankou Administrative Region of Chahar Province, are placed under the leadership of this city.

    With the exception of Huangcun District, which is entirely assigned to Jizhong, and Shijingshan and Mentougou Districts, which remain entirely unchanged, and Changxindian District, which is basically unchanged, the remaining areas of the original suburban districts are largely merged into new districts. As a result of the re-division, the suburbs are divided into eight districts. The changes in the districts are as follows: (1) The original thirteenth and fourteenth districts are merged into the thirteenth district; (2) The original fifteenth and twenty-third districts are merged into the fourteenth district; (3) The area south of the new urban area of the original sixteenth district and the area north of Gaojiabao and Gujiazhuang in the original twenty-fifth district are merged into the fifteenth district; (4) The original seventeenth and eighteenth districts, the area north of the new urban area of the original sixteenth district, and the five villages including Xibeiwang, etc., transferred from Changshun County, are merged into the sixteenth district; (5) The original nineteenth and twentieth districts are merged into the seventeenth district; (6) The original twenty-sixth district (Changxindian District) north of Gangwa and Wenzhuang is renamed the eighteenth district; (7) The original twenty-seventh district (Shijingshan District) is renamed the nineteenth district; (8) The original twenty-eighth district (Mentougou District) is renamed the twentieth district. (Reporter's note: In the original district divisions, the twenty-first and twenty-second districts only had code names. The twenty-fourth district, i.e., Huangcun District, is assigned to Jizhong.)

　　平市界重新调整  郊区划为八个区
    【本报讯】北平市人民政府日前奉到华北人民政府关于重新调整本市市界的指令，将与本市建设关系较少的一部分农村分别划归冀中与察哈尔，另将察哈尔所属昌顺县一小部分地区划归本市领导。同时，市府郊委会为了便于领导各郊区，特重划郊区为八个区，同时调整人事，分令新旧区长于七月二日以前办理交接事宜，规定七月二日为原区最后用印日期，七月三日为新区启印日期。
    市界的变动是这样的：（一）黄村区（即二十四区）四十六个村及丰台区南端高家堡、谷家庄、立垡、鹅坊等四村，共计五十个村划归冀中十专区。（二）长辛店之岗洼、温庄、大岭一线以南十二个村划归察哈尔省平西专区。（三）察哈尔省南口专区昌顺县之西北旺、东北旺、后厂、傅家窑、后营等五村，划归本市领导。
    郊区原有各区除黄村区全部划归冀中，石景山、门头沟两区全部未动，长辛店区基本上未动外，其余大部系两个区合并为一个新区，重划的结果，郊区共分为八个区，区的变更如下：（一）原十三、十四两区合并为十三区；（二）原十五、二十三两区合并为十四区；（三）原十六区新市区以南与原二十五区高家堡，谷家庄以北合并为十五区；（四）原十七、十八两区，原十六区新市区以北与由昌顺县划入之西北旺等五村，合并为十六区；（五）原十九、二十两区合并为十七区；（六）原二十六区（长辛店区）岗洼、温庄以北改为十八区；（七）原二十七区（石景山区）改为十九区；（八）原二十八区（门头沟区）改为二十区；（记者按：原区划中，二十一、二十二两区仅有代号。二十四区即黄村区，划归冀中。）（市府新闻处）
