Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th. The Shanghai Military Control Commission, in order to safeguard the lives and property of the Chinese people and to prevent imperialist and Kuomintang bandit remnant forces from engaging in military sabotage, has formulated the "Provisional Measures for International Telegraph Inspection," which will be promulgated and implemented from the 16th of this month. The measures stipulate that all telegrams and spoken broadcast scripts sent through Shanghai's international radio stations must be inspected by the Military Control Commission's Telegraph Inspection Group and stamped with a release mark before they can be sent and broadcast. The content must not directly or indirectly mention the weather conditions in the liberated areas, the location and extent of damage from bandit plane bombings and strafing, the status of air defense facilities and the terrain of the airport locations, the People's Liberation Army's locations, numbers, designations, supplies, logistics, movements, radio stations and military-related equipment, the situation of various factories, or the locations of the Military Control Commission, the People's Government, and all other Party, government, military organs, and people's organizations. Violations will be subject to appropriate punishment depending on the severity of the circumstances.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th. The Foreign Affairs Office of the Shanghai Military Control Commission summoned Mr. Henderson, the acting director of the United States Information Service remaining in Shanghai, and Mr. Hulist, the director of the British Information Service, on the morning of the 15th of this month to inform them that these two information services should cease all their activities from today. Note: The information services of Britain and the United States are part of the diplomatic missions of the British and American governments. Since the liberation of Shanghai, they have not stopped all their propaganda activities, including the publication of news, publications, films, libraries, photo exhibitions, concerts, etc.; however, the current Chinese People's Democratic Government has not yet established diplomatic relations with these two countries or any foreign country, therefore the Military Control Commission ordered them to cease activities.

    并命令美英新闻处停止活动
    【新华社上海十八日电】沪市军管会为保障中国人民生命财产的安全，防止帝国主义、国民党匪帮残余势力进行军事破坏，特制定“国际电讯检查暂行办法”，于本月十六日起公布施行。该办法规定：凡经由沪市国际电台发出的电讯、口语广播稿本，均须经军管会电讯检查组检查，加盖放行戳记后始得发出和播送。其内容不得直接或间接述及解放区之气象、匪机轰炸与扫射地点及损害情形、防空设施状况及机场所在地势状况，人民解放军驻地、人数、番号、供应、辎重、调动、电台及军事性质设备，各工厂的情况和军管会、人民政府及其他一切党、政、军机关、人民团体之所在地点。如有违反，得按情节轻重予该发电人以适当处分。
    【新华社上海十八日电】上海市军管会外侨事务处本月十五日上午把留在上海的美国新闻处代理处长韩德生和英国新闻处处长胡理仕召来谈话，通知他们，这两个新闻处应当自即日起停止它们的一切活动。按：英、美两国的新闻处是英、美两国政府外交机构的一部分，自从上海解放以来，一直没有停止它们的一切宣传活动，包括发布新闻、出版、电影、图书馆、图片展览会、音乐会等；但是，目前中国人民民主政府还没有同该两国以及任何外国建立外交关系，因此军管会命令它们停止活动。
