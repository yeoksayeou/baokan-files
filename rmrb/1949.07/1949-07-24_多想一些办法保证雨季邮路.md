　　Think of More Ways to Guarantee Postal Routes During the Rainy Season

    The annual rainy season has arrived. Rising river waters and disrupted postal lines during the rainy season are to be expected. The North China Postal Administration, in order to solve this problem, has determined a management method for main postal lines (as detailed in this newspaper on June 18th), tasking each regional bureau with advance planning and devising various alternative measures. This is very timely.
    North China has many mountains and rivers. In the Taihang area, there are thirty-six rivers across twenty-eight postal routes. It is very difficult to pass when mountain floods erupt. In the plains and depressions, the water becomes a vast expanse, making travel very inconvenient. However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, our postal workers displayed a high degree of initiative and creativity, overcoming these difficulties as much as possible. For example, on July 15th of last year, fierce battles were raging on the south bank of the Yellow River in the Jiluyu area. Nine postal workers and sailors, carrying a boatload of mail, insisted on ensuring the postal route. The boat was bombed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit planes, resulting in five deaths and one injury among the nine. The remaining three people, after taking care of their dead and wounded comrades, swam across the perilous Yellow River, clinging to a broken plank, and victoriously completed their task. There are many such moving stories. Now that the war in North China has ended, transportation, material, and other conditions are much better than in the past. As long as we subjectively do what should be done, this problem is not difficult to solve.
    We believe that the segmented responsibility system is a good method. Stipulating that a certain segment is the responsibility of a certain bureau allows them to plan in advance: if this road is impassable, which road should be used as a replacement; if this mode of transportation is unusable, which mode of transportation can be used as a replacement; preparing ferries in the plains, organizing river crossing teams in the mountains... making use of all our existing usable conditions. We believe that relying on the active efforts of postal workers, the full preparation of the postal bureau, and the multifaceted assistance of Party, government, military organs, and the broad masses, the difficulties caused by the rainy season to postal work can be overcome.

### 多想一些办法保证雨季邮路

　　多想一些办法保证雨季邮路
    一年一度的雨季来到了。雨季河水上涨，运输邮线受阻，原为意料中事。华北邮政总局为了解决这个问题，已确定主要干线邮线分段管理办法（详见六月十八日本报），责成各区局预为筹划，想出各种替代办法，这是非常适合时宜的。
    华北多童山，河流又多，太行区二十八条邮路上，就有三十六条河。山洪暴发时很难通过。平原洼地，水来一片汪洋，行走也很不便。但是，在抗日战争与解放战争中，我们的邮工发挥高度的积极性与创造性，把这些困难都尽量克服了。例如：去年七月十五日，冀鲁豫黄河南岸血战方酣，九个邮工和水手载着一船邮件，坚持保证邮路，船被蒋匪飞机炸毁了，九个人五死一伤，其余三人安置好死伤的同伴，抱着一个破木板泅过黄河天险，胜利完成任务。象这样可歌可泣的事是很多的。现在华北地区战争结束了，交通、物质等条件比过去好多了，只要主观上把应作的事情作好，这个问题是不难解决的。
    我们认为：分段负责制是个好办法。规定某一段归某个局负责，她可以事先筹划，这条道路不能走了，得用那条道路代替；这种交通工具不能用了，可用那种交通工具代替；在平原准备渡船，在山地组织送河队……，把我们现有的一切可用条件都运用起来。我们相信：依靠邮政职工的积极努力，依靠邮局方面的充分准备，再加以党政军机关和广大群众的多方协助，雨季给邮政工作造成的困难当可克服。
