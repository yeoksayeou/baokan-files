　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25th: TASS, Paris: On July 23rd, the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Executive Committee of the International Seamen and Dockworkers Trade Union Federation (one of the trade departments affiliated to the World Federation of Trade Unions) held a joint meeting to listen to a report from a delegation that visited London at the invitation of the London dockworkers' "Anti-Employment Committee" to obtain information about the London dockworkers' strike. Afterwards, the Executive Committee of the International Seamen and Dockworkers Trade Union Federation issued a statement saying: The London dockworkers have set an outstanding example of unity for international trade unions, and their courage and unity deserve to be promoted and praised by the global trade union movement. The statement also said: The British government's use of troops to deal with the working people, and the attempts by traitors to the trade union movement to force trade union members to act like strike-breakers, are measures that the global trade union movement must unite its ranks to oppose. The refusal to employ London dockworkers once again proves the historical significance and necessity of seamen and dockworkers joining the International Seamen and Dockworkers Trade Union Federation. Only with the help of this organization can seamen around the world successfully fight to defend their rights and protect their interests. Only through such an organization can they successfully repel attacks like those suffered by the London dockworkers.

　　参加国际工人组织才能击退敌人进攻
    国际海员码头工人职工部执委会为伦敦码头工人罢工事发表声明
    【新华社北平二十五日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：七月二十三日，世界工联书记处及国际海员与码头工人职工联合会（世界工联所属职工部之一）执委会举行联席会议，听取应伦敦码头工人“拒雇委员会”的邀请而访问伦敦以获取伦敦码头工人罢工的消息的代表团的报告。会后，国际海员码头工人职工会联合会执委会发表声明称：伦敦码头工人为国际职工会的团结一致树立了卓越的楷模，他们的勇敢和团结是值得全世界职工运动加以推崇和赞许的。声明又称：英国政府使用军队来对付劳动人民，职工运动叛卖者企图强使职工会会员们象罢工破坏者那样行动，这些都是全世界职工运动必须团结其队伍来反对的措施。伦敦码头工人之被拒雇，再一次证明海员与码头工人加入国际海员与码头工人职工会联合会的历史意义及必要性。只有在该组织的帮助下，全世界的海员才能胜利地进行保卫他们权益和保障他们利益的斗争。只有经由这种组织，他们才能胜利地击退类似伦敦码头工人所受到的进攻。
