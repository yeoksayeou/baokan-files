　　The People's Laws Must Not Be Violated
    North China People's Supervisory Institute Accepts This Newspaper's Opinion to Thoroughly Investigate the Automobile Accident in Handan City and the Pangjiabu Mine Incident

    [This Newspaper Dispatches] After seeing the news in this newspaper's "Criticism and Suggestions" column on the 19th, that "Vehicles from Handan City Transportation Company are constantly causing accidents, repeatedly running over and killing pedestrians", the North China People's Supervisory Institute believes that this is a serious violation of laws and discipline, a flagrant disruption of traffic order, and a vile act that should be strictly punished. In order to clarify the facts, pursue responsibility, prevent its recurrence and development, strictly establish traffic order and educate the cadres of various transportation departments, the institute has sent letters to the North China Highway Transportation Bureau, the Jinnan Administrative Office, and the Handan City Transportation Company to conduct a thorough investigation, and to report the results of the investigation and proposed handling within ten days of receipt of the letter for discussion and resolution by the institute. In addition, regarding the case of continuous damage to important equipment at the Longyan Iron Mine's Pangjiabu Mine, the institute dispatched Supervisory Commissioner Wu Guanghua and others, along with personnel from the Public-operated Enterprise Department and the Ministry of Public Security, on the 18th of this month to conduct a thorough investigation.
