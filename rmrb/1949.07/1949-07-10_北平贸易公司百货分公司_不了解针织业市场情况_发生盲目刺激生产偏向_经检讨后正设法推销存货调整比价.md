Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 9th: The Department Store Branch of the Beiping Municipal Trading Company has experienced a tendency to blindly stimulate production while supporting the knitwear industry. The company did not have a sufficient understanding of market needs, failed to appropriately manage the relationship between production and sales, and continuously stimulated knitwear production with excessively high profits, leading to an imbalance between the supply and demand of knitwear products, resulting in a large backlog of unsold finished goods and a tie-up of capital. Since April of this year, the company has adopted the policy of "transforming the consumer city into a production city" and has been supporting the knitwear industry by exchanging cotton yarn for finished products. However, at that time, the company neither conducted an in-depth investigation of market sales nor seriously studied the profits of the knitwear industry. It rashly stipulated that one bundle of cotton yarn (140 taels) could be exchanged for 90 taels of colored socks or 98 taels of towels. According to the calculations of the knitwear businesses, this ratio allowed them to obtain a high profit of 10 to 20 taels of cotton yarn per bundle. With the support of loans from the cooperative bank, the knitwear industry developed rapidly under the stimulus of high profits. In just three months, the number of machines increased by two-thirds compared to before liberation, and production also surged. The company exchanged for over 1,400 dozen pairs of socks in April, over 15,000 dozen pairs in May, and over 41,000 dozen pairs by the 25th of June. However, the quality of the products decreased due to the company's unlimited purchases, and as a result, only over 7,000 dozen pairs were sold in three months. The company's capital was excessively tied up, making it impossible to continue purchasing, and affecting the re-production of the knitwear industry. After discovering and reviewing this blindness in supporting production, the company is now actively promoting the sale of inventory and appropriately adjusting the exchange ratio. At the same time, it is mobilizing the knitwear industry to consider long-term interests, improve product quality, reduce costs, and cooperate with the trading company in actively seeking sales channels.

    不了解针织业市场情况　发生盲目刺激生产偏向
    经检讨后正设法推销存货调整比价
    【新华社北平九日电】北平市贸易公司所属之百货分公司在扶植针织业中发生盲目刺激生产偏向。该公司对市场需要的情况既了解不够，未适当掌握产销关系，又以过高的利润不断刺激针织业生产，致使针织品生产供需失调，大量成品销不出去，资金积压。今年四月以来，该公司为实行“将消费城市变为生产城市”的方针，即采用以棉纱交换成品方式扶植针织业。但当时该公司既未深入调查市场销路，亦未切实研究针织业的利润，贸然规定棉纱一捆（一百四十两）换色袜九十两或毛巾九十八两。这一比率，即按针织业户计算，每捆纱亦可获得十两至二十两棉纱的高额利润。加以合作银行的贷款扶植，针织业在高额利润刺激下，迅速发展起来，在短短三个月中，机器数较解放前增加了三分之二，生产量也激增。该公司四月份换入的袜子为一千四百余打，五月份换入一万五千余打，六月份截至二十五日止，即换入了四万一千余打。而产品质量则因该公司无限制地收购而降低，结果三个月中销出者仅七千余打。公司资金既积压过多，无法继续收购，且影响针织业的再生产。该公司发现这一扶植生产上的盲目性现象并经检讨后，刻正一面积极推销存货，并将交换比价予以适当调整，一面动员针织业为长远利益着想，提高产品质量与减低成本，配合贸易公司主动寻找销路。
