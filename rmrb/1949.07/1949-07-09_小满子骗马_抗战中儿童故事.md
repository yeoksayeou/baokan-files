Little Manzi Deceives the Horse
  A Children's Story from the War of Resistance
    Song Ping

    There was a thirteen-year-old primary school student in Shiliang Village named Little Manzi. One morning, he went to Fengcheng, north of his village, to visit relatives. At noon, the enemy from Renqiu surrounded the village. The young and quick-footed people ran away, leaving behind some old men, old women, and women who were gathered in the large temple for a meeting. Little Manzi, because he was young, went unnoticed and stayed on the street. As he was standing there, a Japanese soldier leading a tall horse walked towards him, shouting, "Little kid, come here, walk the horse..."

    Little Manzi at home always loved to ride donkeys and mules. When he saw this big horse, he liked it very much. But his heart was pounding a little. There was no way around it. He had been caught up in this situation. So he said, "Okay, okay," took the reins, and led the horse for a walk.

    This horse was really well-built, with glossy mane and a fat rump. As he led the horse, he was plotting in his heart: "Damn it, I'll take this horse away!"

    He led it far away, then led it back, back and forth. He took a liking to the stone oxen axis standing at the west entrance of the village. He looked at the stone oxen axis and measured the horse's saddle and stirrups. Then, he made up his mind.

    The Japanese soldier saw that he was young and that he was walking the horse well. So he went to a villager's house to tidy up something. Little Manzi took the opportunity to lead the horse to the west entrance of the village again, pulled it to the stone oxen axis, looked around to see if there was anyone around, climbed up and stood on the stone oxen axis, climbed up again and got on the saddle, then swung his little legs to the side and sat on it. Then, he kicked the horse's belly with his little feet, and gathered the reins in both hands. The horse then "shut its mouth" and ran south.

    After some time, the Japanese soldier walked out of a house, eating an egg as he walked. He stood at the crossroads for a long time but didn't see Little Manzi return, so he became a little anxious. He looked to the east of the village, but neither the person nor the horse was to be seen. He looked to the west of the village, but neither the person nor the horse was to be seen. He started shouting and yelling. It happened that an old man who was carrying water for them came from the north. He asked, "Hey, you, little kid, walking the horse, have you seen him?..." The old man waved his hand and said, "Oh, me, little kid, walking the horse, didn't see him..." The Japanese soldier angrily smashed the unfinished egg on the old man's temple and cursed, "Bastard!" Then he shouted and yelled and went somewhere to look for him.

    Little Manzi, riding on the horse, didn't head towards his own village. He turned east and ran down, running thirty li in one breath. Reaching a village on the border of Suining, he was stopped by a sentry. It turned out that a battalion of our 33rd Regiment was stationed in this village. When he saw that it was his own troop, he got off the horse and fell into the firewood pile.

    The sentry asked him, "Hey, little comrade, where are you from?" He only gasped, waving his hands, unable to say a word. When Little Manzi was sent to the battalion headquarters, he told the whole story of deceiving the horse from beginning to end.

    The delighted regimental commander held him in his arms, kissing his face and saying, "You are really our little treasure!"

　　小满子骗马
  　抗战中儿童故事
    宋平
    石梁庄有个小学生，十三岁，名叫小满子，一天早晨往他村北面的冯城去串亲戚。中午的时候，任邱的敌人将该村包围了，青年腿快的都跑了，剩下一些老头、老婆、妇女都被集到大庙里去开会。小满子因为年小，不被注意，就呆在街上了。正呆着，一个鬼子牵着匹高头大马向他一边走来一边喊道：“小孩的来，马的遛跶遛跶的……”。
    小满子在家里就总爱骑个驴呀骡呀的，他一看到这匹大马，好不喜欢。但心里有些扑通扑通跳，跳也没法，赶到这场了，于是他说声：“好的，好的。”就接过缰绳牵过马遛起弯来。
    这马长的可真不错，油光水滑的鬃毛，好肥的骠。他牵着马遛，一面在心里可就盘算起来了：“狗日的我将这马弄走！”
    他遛远了，又遛回来，遛来遛去。他相中了村西口立着的那一块石牛轴，他看看石牛轴，打量打量马的鞍镫，于是，想定了主意。
    鬼子看他年纪小，看他这马遛的又不错，就到老乡家去收拾啥去了。小满子趁机把马又遛到村西口来，拉它到石牛轴根前，看看四外无人，他一爬就站在石牛轴上，又一爬就爬上了马鞍子，接着把小腿一偏就骑上了，然后用小脚向马肚子上一踢，两手一拢马缰绳，这马便“收口的”往南跑开了。
    过了些时候，那鬼子从一家门里走了出来，还边走边吃着鸡蛋呢。站在十字街口站了半天也没见小满子回来，就有些急了。他往村东头看去，是人不见马也不见，他往村西去看，也是人不见马也不见，他就唧啦哇啦的喊了起来，正赶上一个给他们挑水的老汉从北边过来了，他问：“喂，你的，小孩的，遛马的，看见没有的？……”老汉摇着手说：“哦，我的，小孩的，遛马的，没看见的……”鬼子气得把没吃完的鸡蛋摔到老汉的太阳穴上骂了声：“八个的！”就又唧啦哇呱啦的喊着向什么地方找去了。
    小满子骑在马上，他不奔自己的村里走，他偏着东拐下去了，一口气跑了三十里。到达肃宁交界地方的一个村，被一个站岗的哨兵挡住，原来这村正住着我们三十三团的一个营，他一看是自己的队伍，下得马来，一头便倒在柴火堆里了。
    站岗的问他：“喂，小同志，打那来？”他只顾喘气了，摆摆手，讲不出一句话。等小满子被送到了营部时，才从头到尾把骗马的事说得一清二楚。
    喜得团长把他拢在怀里，一边亲着他的脸一边说：“你真是我们的一个小宝贝儿”！
