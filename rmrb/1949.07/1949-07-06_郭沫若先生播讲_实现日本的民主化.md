　　[Ping City News] On July 5th, Mr. Guo Moruo gave a speech at the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station, entitled: "Achieving the Democratization of Japan." The full text is as follows:

　　Our China has suffered the most from Japanese imperialism and was the earliest to oppose it, sacrificing the most in the military action to defeat Japanese imperialism. Therefore, we, the Chinese people, should have the greatest say in dealing with the issue of defeated Japan.

　　However, after Japan's surrender, the Kuomintang reactionary government, relying on the aid of American imperialism to maintain its dictatorial autocracy and suppress our Chinese people, acted as a slave, listening to the dictates of American imperialism in everything. It not only sacrificed our due rights in dealing with the Japanese issue but also recognized the enemy as its father, following American imperialism to support the revival of Japanese imperialism. This is one of the greatest sorrows of our Chinese people.

　　Now, our Chinese people have turned over. Our Chinese people's armed forces, the Chinese People's Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party, have defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries, who were fully supported by American imperialism, and a people's democratic united government will soon be established. We, the Chinese people, have regained our position as masters, which means that we have regained all due rights in dealing with all domestic and foreign issues. Therefore, in dealing with the issue of defeated Japan, we must restore our due right to speak.

　　The Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, in which China, the United States, and the United Kingdom urged Japan to surrender, clearly stipulated that "the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be eliminated for all time" (Article 6), "Obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people shall be removed; freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established" (Article 10), and "a peacefully inclined and responsible government will be established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people" (Article 12).

　　This proclamation was later joined by the Soviet Union after its declaration of war against Japan (August 9, 1945), with the Soviet government declaring that it "accepts the invitation of the Allies" and "participates" in it.

　　Therefore, this Potsdam Proclamation is a joint agreement of the four major powers: China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In dealing with the issue of defeated Japan, the foreign ministers of the four major powers should first hold a meeting to make preliminary agreements. This is beyond doubt.

　　We consider the Potsdam Proclamation to be quite fair. Its main purpose is to thoroughly eliminate the aggressive forces of Japanese imperialism and allow the Japanese people to freely embark on the road to democratization.

　　Unfortunately, after Japan's surrender, the control over defeated Japan was monopolized by American imperialism. MacArthur became the supreme emperor of Japan, and all measures were anti-people, anti-democratic, and contrary to the Potsdam Agreement. Releasing war criminals, halting reparations, preserving the zaibatsu, supporting reactionary forces, maintaining military production, covertly restoring armaments, delaying the peace treaty with Japan, and on the other hand, frantically intensifying the suppression of the Japanese people, inciting the Japanese House of Representatives to pass the new labor law depriving Japanese workers of their rights, prohibiting student movements and academic freedom with the "National University Law" and the "Teacher Qualification Examination Law," massacring workers, suppressing strikes, and all reactionary behaviors were even more intensified than during the era of the Japanese imperialist government.

　　Defeated Japan has now in fact become a factory for American monopoly capitalists, using American raw materials and cheap Japanese labor to produce large quantities of goods, exporting them to Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and Western Europe, from which the double profits extracted reach 300% to 1100%.

　　Therefore, the American government is attempting to occupy Japan for a long time and re-equip Japan as a military base for aggression against the Far East and the world. On March 1st of this year, MacArthur blatantly told a reporter from the American Daily Mail: "The Pacific has now become a Saxon lake. The Philippines, Ryukyu, and Japan have become the front line of the United States. Japan has become a stronghold of rights and interests that the United States and Britain should have. It is extremely easy to recruit troops in Japan to cooperate with us."

　　Van Horn, the head of the expert team at MacArthur Headquarters, had a memorandum to the U.S. State Department on June 4th, in which he said even more bluntly: "Under the current conditions, Japan should play the role of the main ally of the United States in the Far East. Japanese territory should be used as the main land, sea, and air force base of the United States in the Far East. The United States should prepare everything in this direction so that Japan can become the actual ally of the United States as soon as possible."

　　Do not these statements reveal the ambitions of American imperialism without reservation?

　　A group of American ambitious schemers sometimes pretend to be innocent. After fully and blatantly exposing themselves in action and words, they sometimes resort to a sophistry of covering their ears while stealing a bell. That is completely a waste of effort.

　　Our Chinese people's attitude towards handling the Japanese issue is open and aboveboard. We have no ambitions whatsoever. In a nutshell, we want to abide by the Potsdam Agreement and promote the realization of Japan's democratization.

　　The democratization of Japan is an important factor for peace in the Far East. This is not only in the interests of the Chinese people but also in the common interests of the nations of the Far East, and at the same time in the interests of the Japanese people themselves. Although our Chinese people have a blood feud with Japanese imperialists, we have always been friends with the Japanese people. The Japanese people have also been exploited and oppressed by Japanese imperialists. Today, American imperialists are trying to turn Japan into a colony of the United States, and the Japanese people will suffer double exploitation and oppression as we did yesterday. If the ambitions of American imperialism are gradually realized, this will not only infringe upon the independence of the Japanese nation and its peaceful and democratic economic development but also directly threaten the security of our China and the Far East. Our Chinese people cannot silently approve of this.

　　Today, we, the Chinese people, want to clearly put forward our specific expressions:

　　⒈ Rapidly convene a four-power peace treaty preparation meeting with the participation of fully authorized representatives of the People's Democratic New China, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

　　⒉ Thoroughly eliminate Japanese militarism, destroy all forces that create war, and re-disarm all disguised armaments.

　　⒊ Re-try Japanese war criminals, dissolve the Japanese zaibatsu, and strictly implement the reparations plan, and it may be based on the interim reparations plan announced by the United States in April 1947 according to the requirements of various countries.

　　⒋ Abolish all reactionary old and new laws promulgated by the Japanese puppet government under the connivance and protection of MacArthur.

　　⒌ Cancel all selfish and arbitrary illegal decisions made by the American government and MacArthur Headquarters in handling the Japanese issue.

　　These conditions are necessary conditions for the realization of Japan's democratization. Only under these conditions can the Japanese people have the freedom to express their will and can "establish a peacefully inclined and responsible government in accordance with the freely expressed will." We believe that all genuine Japanese people will unanimously welcome these provisions of ours.

　　Today, the victory of our Chinese people has completely changed the situation in the Far East. The victory of our Chinese people is also the victory of the Japanese people, and the Japanese people have expressed their welcome with the same enthusiasm. The democratic forces of the Japanese people are growing stronger day by day. Taking the seats of the Japanese Communist Party in the Japanese House of Representatives as an example, in the elections at the beginning of this year, they jumped more than tenfold. This is the best proof. The general trend is irreversible, and the people's hearts are directed towards it. Japan must be democratized, and Japan will definitely be democratized.

　　We, the Chinese people, fully agree with the Xinhua News Agency's commentary on June 20, "Rapidly Prepare for a Peace Treaty with Japan." We may repeat the last few sentences here:

　　"Regardless of whether American imperialism is willing or not, the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world, headed by the Soviet Union, together with the people of the Far East, together with the increasingly powerful democratic forces of Japan, will surely defeat the reactionary policy of American imperialism towards Japan, will surely strive to help Japan's democratization, and will surely fight for lasting peace in the Far East and the world!"

### 郭沫若先生播讲  实现日本的民主化

　　郭沫若先生播讲  实现日本的民主化
    【平市讯】七月五日郭沫若先生在北平新华广播电台演讲，讲题是：“实现日本的民主化”，全文如下：
    我们中国是受日本帝国主义的祸害最深，反对日本帝国主义最早，在打败日本帝国主义的军事行动上牺牲最大的一个国家。因而在处理战败日本的问题上，我们中国人民应该有最大的发言权。
    但在日本投降以后，国民党反动政府依赖美帝国主义的援助，以维持其独裁专制，来镇压我们中国人民，奴颜婢膝地一切都听从美帝国主义的驱使，不仅牺牲了我们在处理日本问题上应有的权利，更反而认贼作父，追随美帝国主义去扶植日本帝国主义的复兴。这是我们中国人民最大痛心事之一。
    现在我们中国人民翻了身，我们中国人民的武装力量，中国共产党所领导的中国人民解放军，已经打败了美帝国主义所全力支持的国民党反动派，不久便要成立人民民主联合政府了。我们中国人民恢复了做主人翁的地位，也就是说我们恢复了在处理对内对外一切问题上一切应有的权利。因而在处理战败日本的问题上，我们要恢复我们应有的发言权了。
    一九四五年七月二十六日中美英三国促令日本投降的波茨坦公告，明白地规定着“欺骗及错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界者之威权及势力，必须永久剔除”（第六条），“日本政府必须将阻止日本人民民主趋势之复兴及增强之所有障碍予以消除，言论宗教及思想自由以及对于基本人权之重视必须成立”（第十条）并“依据日本人民自由表示之意志成立一倾向和平及负责之政府”（第十二条）。
    这公告，后经苏联对日宣战（一九四五年八月九日），由苏联政府声明“接受同盟国的邀请”而“参加”了。
    因此，这波茨坦公告，是中苏英美四大国的共同协定。在处理战败日本的问题上，要先由中苏英美四大国的外长会议来预行协定，这是毫无疑问的事。
    波茨坦公告，我们认为是相当公允的。它的主要目的便是要彻底消灭日本帝国主义的侵略势力，使日本人民自由地走上民主化的道路。
    可是遗憾得很，日本投降以后，战败日本的管制权为美帝国主义所垄断，麦克阿瑟成为了日本的太上天皇，一切的措施都是反人民，反民主，反波茨坦协定的勾当。释放战犯，停止赔偿，保存财阀，扶植反动势力，维持军需生产，变相地恢复武装，拖延对日和约，而在另一方面，则疯狂地加紧镇压日本人民，嗾使日本众议院通过剥夺日本劳工权利的新劳工法，禁止学生运动与教学自由的“国立大学法”和“教员资格审查法”，屠杀工人，弹压罢工，一切反动行为比日本帝国主义政府时代还要变本加厉。
    战败后的日本，在今天事实上是成为了美国独占资本家的工厂，以美国的原料加上日本的便宜劳动力，生产大量的商品，输出到东南亚，中南美与西欧，由此所榨取的双重利润，竟达到百分之三百至百分之一千一百。
    因而美国政府便企图长久占领日本，并把日本重新装备成一个侵略远东和全世界的军事基地。麦克阿瑟在本年三月一日对美国每日邮报的记者，竟明目张胆地这样说：“太平洋目前已变成萨克逊湖，菲律宾、琉球、日本已成为美国的前卫线，日本已成为美英所应有的权益据点。在日本募集与吾人合作的军队至为容易。”
    麦克阿瑟总部的专家团团长范恩在六月四日有致美国国务院说明书一份，其中有这样的话，说得更露骨：“在目前条件下，日本在远东应起美国主要同盟者的作用。日本领土应被用作美国在远东主要的陆海空军基地。美国一切都应向着这个方向准备，以便日本尽快的成为美国的实际同盟者。”
    这些表示不是把美帝国主义的野心透露无遗了吗？
    美国的一群野心家有时却又要伪装天真，在充分露骨地在行动上和口舌上自行暴露了之后，时而又来一套掩耳盗铃的诡辩。那完全是白费气力的。
    我们中国人民对于处理日本问题的态度是光明磊落的，我们没有丝毫的野心，一句话归总，便是要信守波茨坦协定，促进日本民主化的实现。
    日本的民主化是远东和平的一个重要的因素，这不单是中国人民的利益，远东民族共同的利益，而同时是日本人民本身的利益。我们中国人民对日本帝国主义者虽然有血海深仇，但和日本人民却始终是朋友。日本人民同样是受着日本帝国主义者的剥削和压迫的，今天美国帝国主义者一心想把日本变成为美国的殖民地，日本人民又将和我们昨天一样受着双重的剥削和压迫了。假如让美帝国主义的野心逐步实现，这不仅侵犯日本民族的独立与其和平民主的经济发展，而且直接威胁着我们中国和远东的安全，我们中国人民是不能够默许的。
    今天，我们中国人民要明确地提出我们的具体的表示：
    ⒈迅速按照波茨坦协定，定期举行有人民民主新中国全权代表参加的四国对日和约准备会议。
    ⒉彻底肃清日本军国主义，毁灭一切制造战争的力量，重新解除一切变相的武装。
    ⒊重新审判日本战犯，解散日本财阀，严厉执行赔偿计划，不妨以一九四七年四月美国根据各国的要求所发表的临时赔偿计划为标准。
    ⒋废除日本傀儡政府在麦克阿瑟纵容包庇之下所颁布的一切反动的新旧法令。
    ⒌取消美国政府和麦克阿瑟总部在处理日本问题上的一切自私专擅的非法决定。
    这些条件都是实现日本民主化的必要条件，要在这些条件之下，日本人民才能有表示意志之自由，也才能“依据自由表示之意志成立一倾向和平及负责之政府”。我们相信，我们这些条款，凡是真正的日本人民都是会一致欢迎的。
    今天我们中国人民的胜利已经完全改变了远东的局势。我们中国人民的胜利同时也就是日本人民的胜利，日本人民以同样的热情来表示了欢迎。日本人民的民主势力今天是日益壮大了。单拿日本共产党在日本众议院的议席来说，在今年年初的选举，一跃而增加到十倍以上，这便是最好也没有的证明。大势所趋，人心所向，日本必须民主化，日本也是一定会民主化的。
    我们中国人民完全同意六月二十日新华社的“迅速准备对日和约”的时评，那最后的几句话，我们不妨在这儿重说一遍：
    “不管美帝国主义愿意与否，中国人民和以苏联为首的世界各国人民一起，和远东人民一起，和日益强大的日本民主势力一起，一定要战胜美帝国主义者的反动的对日政策，一定要努力帮助日本的民主化，一定要为远东和世界的持久和平而奋斗！”
