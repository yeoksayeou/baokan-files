Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 30th: The People's Liberation Army is not only a fighting force but also a work force. This has already begun to be implemented in the Zhejiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. Before July 20th, various units and organs under the Military Region dispatched work teams, combined with local cadres and revolutionary youth students, to form armed work teams to go to the countryside to carry out rural work. The troops sent by a certain military unit alone amounted to more than 980 cadres and soldiers. Before going to the countryside, the personnel of each work team had separately concentrated on studying the work plans of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China for July, August, and September, as well as the policies for the newly liberated areas, correcting the erroneous view held by a few comrades that "going to the local area is not honorable" and various incorrect personal plans.

　　浙江军区部队派工作队下乡
    【新华社杭州三十日电】人民解放军是战斗队，同时又是工作队。这在人民解放军浙江军区已开始实行，该军区所属各部队机关，已于七月二十日前，纷纷派遣工作小组，结合地方干部及革命青年学生，组成武装工作队，下乡开展农村工作，仅某军派出的干部和战士，即有九百八十余名。各工作小组人员在下乡前，曾分别集中学习了中共浙江省委七、八、九三个月的工作计划和新区政策，纠正了少数同志认为“到地方上去不光荣”的错误观点和各种不正确的个人打算。
