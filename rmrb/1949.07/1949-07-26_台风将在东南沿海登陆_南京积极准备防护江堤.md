Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 25th: The Nanjing Meteorological Observatory issued a typhoon warning on the morning of the 24th, stating: "At 2:00 AM on the 24th, the center of the typhoon was located at 27 degrees North latitude and 125 degrees East longitude, having crossed the Ryukyu Islands. Its intensity is increasing. Its speed is 13 nautical miles per hour. The wind direction is northwest by west. The diameter of the gale-force wind range is 100 miles and is about to land on the southeast coast of China, most likely hitting Wenzhou and Ningbo. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River will experience strong winds and rain (Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou are within the affected area of strong winds and rain, while Nanjing is on the edge of the typhoon). This type of typhoon may cause damage to the embankments along the river and inland rivers." After the above warning was issued by the Meteorological Observatory, the Nanjing Municipal Summer Flood Prevention Committee has made preparations for the protection of the river embankments. On the southeast coast of China, tropical cyclones often occur in the summer and autumn seasons. Those originating near the Philippine Islands are called typhoons.
