　　Considerable Success Achieved in Managing Foreign Exchange and Supporting Exports

　　Export Loans Issued Reaching 4.3 Billion Yuan

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] The Tianjin Bank of China has achieved considerable success in managing foreign exchange and supporting export trade, initially laying the foundation for foreign exchange operations. By the end of April, the bank had completed the deposit and exchange of foreign currencies, organized a foreign exchange exchange, centralized all foreign exchange trading, and banned the disguised black market of foreign shipping companies selling foreign currency. At the same time, it strengthened border exchange work to prevent foreign currency from infiltrating the country. Statistics up to the end of June show that the wharf alone exchanged more than 20,000 US dollars, more than 144,000 Hong Kong dollars, and a portion of other foreign currencies, reducing foreign currency speculation in the market. In the application of foreign exchange rates, the bank continuously made flexible adjustments based on changes in prices and export profits. From the establishment of the foreign exchange exchange on April 18 to the end of June, a total of 15 adjustments were made, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of export manufacturers for export. Before liberation, many manufacturers were unable to operate exports due to the suppression of the Kuomintang government's reactionary exchange rate policy, but they have begun to work hard to restore and increase exports. In regulating foreign exchange supply and demand, the Bank of China's turnover accounted for more than 43 percent of the total transaction volume from the establishment of the exchange to the end of June, making it possible for the exchange to centralize transactions and regulate supply and demand. The foreign exchange supplied by the foreign exchange exchange has been mostly used for the import of production materials such as hardware, chemicals, and machine parts. The phenomenon of using foreign exchange for the import of luxury goods and consumer goods during the Kuomintang period no longer exists. In the business of supporting the export trade of local products, from March 17 to the end of June, the bank issued various export loans totaling more than 4.3 billion yuan. In order to take care of the actual difficulties of exporters and strive for favorable sales of export loans abroad, in addition to allowing raw materials as collateral and simplifying warehouse rental procedures, before the export goods are purchased, other goods are allowed to be used as collateral first. If the foreign market is not good when the loan is due, it can also be replaced by other goods for export. This has played an active role in promoting trade. Therefore, even when telecommunications are blocked or foreign market conditions are unfavorable, some manufacturers can continue to export.

  　管理外汇扶植出口均已获得相当成绩
    发放出口贷款达四十三亿元
    【新华社天津二十七日电】天津中国银行在管理外汇和扶植出口贸易业务上已获得相当成绩，初步打下了外汇业务的基础。四月底止，该行即完成了对外币的存兑工作，组织外汇交易所，集中了一切外汇买卖，并取缔了外国航输卖外币的变相黑市。同时，加强口境兑换工作，防止外币内侵。截至六月底统计，仅码头一处，即兑入美钞二万余元，港币十四万四千余元及其他外币一部分，减少了市场上的外币投机。在运用外汇牌价上，该行根据物价及出口利润的变化不断作机动调整，计自四月十八日外汇交易所成立至六月底，先后共调整十五次，大大刺激了出口厂商对出口的积极性。解放前不少厂商因受国民党政府的反动牌价政策压制无法经营出口的，已开始努力恢复与增加出口。在调剂外汇供求上，交易所自成立至六月底止，由中国银行吞吐者达成交总额的百分之四十三强，从而使交易所集中成交及调剂供需成为可能。外汇交易所先后供出的外汇大部用于五金用具、化学品、机器零件等生产资料的进口，国民党时期把外汇用于奢侈品、消耗品进口的现象已不复存在。在扶助土产出口贸易的业务上，自三月十七日至六月底，该行共发放了各种出口贷款达四十三亿余万元。为照顾出口商的实际困难，争取出口贷款在国外有利销售，除准以原料作押及简化租库手续外，在出口货未购妥前，并准先以他货作押。如到期时国外行市不好，亦可改以他货代替出口。这对开展贸易起了积极的推动作用。因之即使在电讯不通或国外行情不利之际，若干厂商亦得以继续出口。
