    [This newspaper dispatch] The North China Headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League held a provisional general meeting of League members in Beiping on July 3rd. This was the first grand gathering of the League's North China Headquarters since liberation. At the meeting, after Guo Zhaolie reported on the nature and political主張 of the League, he pointed out that the future tasks are to help liberate Taiwan as soon as possible and to strive for the new construction of Taiwan. The current tasks are: (1) To participate in the work of the New Political Consultative Conference. (2) To put forward the demands of the Taiwanese people,打击 the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to colonize Taiwan, and isolate those treasonous elements engaged in separatist activities. (3) To intensify study, work actively, cultivate cadres, expand the organization, and prepare to participate in the liberation of Taiwan. Subsequently, Wang Bai, Lin Hanmin, and others reported on the work of the League's branch from its establishment to liberation.
    The meeting unanimously endorsed the CCP Central Committee's "July 7th" slogan and resolved to struggle to accomplish the following tasks in the future: (1) To establish a strong leadership structure. (2) To intensify study and prepare to participate in the liberation of Taiwan. (3) To expand the organization, strive for more League members, and establish branches within the North China region. (4) To strengthen attention to women's work.
    The meeting also passed a congratulatory telegram to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in celebration of "July 1st," as well as the organizational regulations of the North China Headquarters, and elected seven members and three alternate members of the general committee. The congratulatory telegram from the meeting is as follows: To the esteemed comrades of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:
    Today, as the People's Liberation War approaches complete victory, we celebrate the 28th anniversary of "July 1st" with unparalleled excitement.
    Since its birth, your Party has led the Chinese revolution and, after 28 years of arduous struggle, has propelled China towards a bright, new democratic society. We deeply feel that without the Chinese Communist Party, there could be no independent, free, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong new China! Now, the public enemy of the people, the Kuomintang reactionaries, have fled to Taiwan, attempting to preserve their remaining strength to make a final struggle. But the steel-like power of the Chinese people is already strong and will completely eliminate the reactionary forces. The people of Taiwan are willing to fight for the liberation of Taiwan under the leadership of the Communist Party!
    Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League
