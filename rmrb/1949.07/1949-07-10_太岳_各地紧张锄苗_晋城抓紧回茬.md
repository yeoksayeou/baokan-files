Taiyue
	Tense Seedling Weeding in Various Areas
	Jincheng Seizes the Opportunity for Replanting
    ▲ Farmers in various parts of Taiyue are vigorously weeding seedlings. In Changzi, Qinyuan, Qin County and other counties, the first round of weeding for corn, beans, hemp, etc. has been completed; in Yangcheng, Jiang County and other places, the second or third round of weeding for millet seedlings, peanuts, cotton, etc. is underway. During the weeding process, various localities, based on past work exchange, have organized a large number of women and semi-able-bodied laborers to participate in mutual assistance, solving the difficulties of weeding, wheat harvesting, pest control, replanting, and replanting squeezed together. However, there are still individual villages pursuing a grand and sensational approach, repeating the formalistic errors of the past, which is harmful and useless, and the local leaders should urgently check and correct them.
    ▲ On June 24th and 25th, there was widespread rainfall of three or four inches in Jincheng County. After the rain, the county government immediately mobilized the masses to seize the opportunity for replanting. During the replanting process, farmers in various villages universally organized work exchange and mutual assistance. In Shanglichuan Village, Seventh District, the entire village organized 145 seed drills, more than 400 male laborers, and more than 80 female laborers, forming mutual aid groups based on the drills. In addition to organizing livestock to pull the drills, 81 human-powered drills were also organized. Of the 1,457 mu of wheat land, 1,007 mu were replanted in one day on the 26th. It is estimated that the replanting of all wheat land in the county will be completed by the beginning of this month.

　　太岳
  　各地紧张锄苗
  　晋城抓紧回茬
    ▲太岳各地农民正大力进行锄苗。长子、沁源、沁县等县玉茭、豆子、大麻等头遍已将锄完；阳城、绛县等地谷苗、花生、棉花等正锄二遍或三遍。锄苗中各地在过去变工的基础上，大量组织妇女、半劳力参加互助，解决了锄苗、麦收、防虫、补种、回茬点种挤在一起的困难。但还有个别村庄追求轰轰烈烈，重复了过去形式主义的错误，有害无益，当地领导亟应检查纠正。
    ▲六月二十四、五两日，晋城全县普遍落雨三四指。雨后县政府即时动员群众抓紧回茬。回茬中各村农民普遍组织变工互助。七区上犁川村，全村组织了一百四十五张耧，四百余男劳力，八十多女劳力，按耧为单位结成互助小组。除组织牲口拉耧外，还组织了八十一张人拉耧。一千四百五十七亩麦地，二十六日一天就回茬了一千零七亩。全县麦地，估计本月初即可回茬完毕。
