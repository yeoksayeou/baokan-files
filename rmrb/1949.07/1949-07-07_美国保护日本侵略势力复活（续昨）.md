The United States Protects the Revival of Japanese Aggressive Forces
Cao Liang, Wang Fei (Continued from yesterday)

(IV) Oppressing and Enslaving the Japanese People

The US policy of actively supporting the revival of Japanese aggressive forces is based on sacrificing and enslaving the Japanese people. In order to clear the way for its own imperialist policies, the United States has consistently and cruelly suppressed the Japanese democratic movement and seriously infringed upon the interests of the broad masses of the Japanese people. For example, MacArthur has consistently adopted measures of interference, prohibition, and suppression against the Japanese workers' strike struggles. On January 31, 1947, MacArthur issued an order prohibiting Japanese workers from holding a general strike. On July 22, 1948, MacArthur instructed the Japanese government to enact legislation prohibiting government employees from striking and collective bargaining. Since the spring of this year, MacArthur has directed the Japanese Diet to pass new labor laws and other reactionary bills that further deprive Japanese laborers of their rights. MacArthur's actions to deprive Japanese laborers of their legitimate rights completely violated the Potsdam Declaration against Japan and the Far Eastern Commission's resolution on the "Principles of Japanese Trade Unions" on December 6, 1946. Not only that, but the US-Japanese reactionaries have also implemented cruel exploitation and oppression of the Japanese people, causing broad sections of the Japanese people to sink deeper and deeper into the abyss of poverty, hunger, and bankruptcy. According to the so-called "Nine-Point Plan for Stabilizing the Japanese Economy" promulgated by the US government last December, the Japanese government is now implementing the so-called "industrial reorganization" and "administrative reform," the result of which is a sharp increase in the number of unemployed in Japan. It is estimated that the number of unemployed will reach approximately 13 million this year. The lives of farmers are extremely hard. Ray, an agricultural expert at MacArthur Headquarters, admitted to reporters on January 10 this year: "Due to the black market, high taxes, and the compulsory collection of large quantities of grain at official prices, farmers in northern Japan have been forced to sell their sons and daughters and rely on borrowing grain to survive." The lives of Japanese students are also very difficult. According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Education, in Tokyo alone, there are 5,000 college students who maintain their lives by selling peanuts and newspapers. Japanese small and medium-sized entrepreneurs are also suffering the same fate. According to Agence France-Presse, "Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises will gradually disappear under the heavy burden of taxes and lack of materials."

It is very clear that MacArthur in Japan is not eliminating Japanese militarism and supporting Japanese democratic forces in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation; on the contrary, he is suppressing Japanese democratic forces and supporting Japanese militarism. The US imperialist policy of supporting the resurgence of Japanese aggressive forces is not only hostile to the people of the world, but also directly attacks the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people, depriving them of their freedom of survival and democratic rights, and making them slaves under the dual oppression of US imperialism and its running dog, the Japanese reactionaries. The United States has repeatedly delayed the peace treaty with Japan in order to use its long-term occupation of Japan to implement its permanent enslavement and rule over the Japanese people, and to prevent the Japanese people from establishing formal diplomatic relations and mutually beneficial trade relations with the people of the world, and to prevent Japan's peaceful economy from obtaining opportunities for recovery and development. Faced with the attacks and oppression of MacArthur and the Japanese reactionaries, the political consciousness of the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people is increasing day by day. They are becoming more and more aware of the ferocious face of US imperialism and its running dogs, and understand that their interests are consistent with those of the working class and the broad masses of the people all over the world. Only by breaking free from the enslavement of the US-Japanese reactionaries can Japan become a truly democratic Japan. Therefore, they have repeatedly launched just struggles to resist the attacks and oppression of the US-Japanese reactionaries.

(V) Japanese Reactionary Forces Have Become Accomplices of US Imperialist Aggression

The result of US imperialism's support for Japanese reactionaries in the political, economic, and military fields for the past four years has not only revived Japanese aggressive forces and greatly fueled their aggressive arrogance, but in reality, Japanese reactionaries have become the main accomplices of US imperialism's aggression against Asia, especially China.

Under the cultivation of the United States, the Japanese are no longer like a defeated country, but appear as victors. The Japanese Diet openly demanded a plebiscite in the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and Northeast China to determine the ownership of these territories. Former Japanese Prime Minister Ashida not only demanded the "recovery" of the Ryukyu Islands, but also demanded special immigration rights to Taiwan. The Chinese "China-Japan Daily" in Tokyo on May 11 last year even clamored for "the merger of China and Japan." An article published in the "Oriental Economic Weekly" on October 23 last year even blatantly demanded that "new colonies should be given to Japan" under the pretext of solving Japan's population problem. On April 7 this year, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida also openly announced in the Diet that Japan would participate in another new war tool that the United States is stepping up preparations for - the "Pacific Pact." The reason why the Japanese reactionaries dare to be so presumptuous is because they are directly encouraged by US imperialism.

Not only that, but with the active assistance of the United States, Japan has carried out actual acts of aggression against Asia, especially China, in many ways, and has become a capable assistant to the United States in implementing its imperialist policies in the Far East and a butcher for the US-Chiang reactionaries in slaughtering the Chinese people. Japanese war criminal Neiji Okamura, former commander of the China Expeditionary Army, served as Chiang Kai-shek's advisor and directly commanded the Kuomintang bandit army in combat. In early July of the year before last, the United States brought two ships of Japanese "special immigrants" to Taiwan, including Japanese war criminal Kiyoshi Hasegawa, the former governor-general of Taiwan, and other Japanese military and political personnel, to build military bases in Taiwan, develop Taiwan's resources, and help the United States train Chiang bandit troops. In March last year, MacArthur sent Japanese war criminal Kanji Horinouchi, the former Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, and others to serve as advisors to Sung bandit Tzu-wen. After taking office, Horinouchi returned to Japan to recruit a large number of experts to go to Guangdong to help the US-Chiang clique develop Hainan Island. At the same time, a large number of Japanese officers and soldiers directly participated in Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war.

From the above simple and very incomplete materials, it is sufficient to prove that under the nearly four years of sole and arbitrary control by the United States, Japan is completely turning into an "Far East arsenal" of US imperialism and an important base for preparing for new war adventures, which seriously threatens the security of the Far East, especially China, and also threatens the survival and security of the Japanese people. At present, the United States is more openly refusing to prepare for a peace treaty with Japan, attempting to implement this imperialist criminal policy through long-term occupation of Japan. Therefore, the Chinese people should unite and further unite with the people of Asia and the people of Japan to wage a resolute struggle against the US imperialist policy of supporting Japan, which is hostile to the people of the world, especially the people of Asia. It is necessary to join the Soviet Union, the leader of the world democratic and peaceful camp, and demand the rapid convening of a four-power preparatory meeting for a peace treaty with Japan, immediately draft a peace treaty with Japan to eliminate Japanese militarism and democratize Japan, and strive to ensure lasting peace in the Far East and the world.

　　美国保护日本侵略势力复活
    操良　王飞（续昨）
    （四）压迫和奴役日本人民
    美国积极扶助日本侵略势力复活的政策，是以牺牲和奴役日本人民作为基础的。美国为了替自己的帝国主义政策扫清道路，始终残酷地压迫日本的民主运动，严重地侵害日本广大人民的利益。例如，麦克阿瑟对日本工人的罢工斗争，一贯采取干涉、禁止与镇压措施。一九四七年一月三十一日，麦克阿瑟曾下令禁止日本工人举行总罢工。一九四八年七月二十二日，麦克阿瑟指令日本政府制定禁止政府雇员罢工与集体议价的立法。今年春季以来，麦氏又指使日本议会通过了进一步剥夺日本劳工权利的新劳工法及其他反动法案。麦克阿瑟这些剥夺日本劳工正当权利的行动，完全违背了波茨坦对日公告与一九四六年十二月六日远东委员会关于“日本工会原则”的决议，不止如此，美日反动派同时向日本人民实行了残酷的榨取和剥削，使日本广大阶层人民日益陷于贫困、饥饿和破产的深渊。日本政府根据美国政府去年十二月颁布的所谓“九点稳定日本经济计划”，现正在实施所谓“工业改组”和“行政改革”，实施结果使日本失业人数激增。估计年内失业者将达约一千三百万人。农民生活极苦。麦克阿瑟总部的农业专家雷氏于今年一月十日招待记者时，也不得不承认：“由于黑市、高税及按官价强迫征收巨量粮食，日本北部的农民已被迫卖儿鬻女，依靠借粮度日。”日本学生的生活也十分艰难。据日本教育部统计，仅东京一地，即有大学生五千人以卖花生、报纸维持生活，日本中小企业家也遭受同样命运。据法新社报道：“日本中小企业在重税及物资缺乏之下，将逐渐消失”。
    这就十分明白，麦克阿瑟在日本，不是按照波茨坦公告的规定，肃清日本军国主义和扶植日本民主势力；而是相反地，镇压日本民主势力，扶植日本军国主义。美国帝国主义扶助日本侵略势力再起的政策，不仅是与世界人民为敌，而且首先是直接进攻日本工人阶级和广大人民，使他们丧失生存自由和民主权利，成为美国帝国主义及其走狗日本反动派双重压迫下的奴隶。美国一再拖延对日和约，就是想利用对日本的长期占领，实行对日本人民的永远的奴役统治，并阻碍日本人民与世界人民建立正式的外交关系与互惠的通商关系，不让日本的和平经济获得恢复和发展的机会。面对着麦克阿瑟和日本反动派的进攻和压迫，日本工人阶级和广大人民的政治觉悟正日益提高，他们一天比一天地更加认识美帝国主义及其走狗的凶恶面目，了解到他们的利益是和全世界工人阶级和广大人民一致的，只有解脱美日反动派的奴役，才能使日本成为真正民主化的日本。因此，他们一再发动正义的斗争，反抗美日反动派的进攻和压迫。
    （五）日本反动势力已变成美帝的侵略帮凶
    美国帝国主义四年来在政治、经济和军事各方面扶植日本反动派的结果，不仅使日本的侵略势力正在复辟，大大助长了它们重行侵略的气焰，而且实际上，日本反动派已经充当美国帝国主义侵略亚洲特别是中国的主要帮凶。
    在美国一手培植下，现在日寇已不象是一个战败者，简直是以一个战胜者的姿态出现了。日本议员会在议会居然公开要求在琉球、台湾和东北举行公民投票，以决定这些领土的谁属。前日本首相芦田不仅要求“收回”琉球，而且还要求对台湾的特别移民权。去年五月十一日的东京华文“中日日报”竟叫嚣“中日两国应当合并”。去年十月二十三日“东洋经济周报”刊载的论文，更以解决日本人口问题为借口露骨要求“应以新殖民地给予日本”。今年四月七日日本首相吉田在议会中，亦赤裸裸地宣布：日本要参加美国正加紧准备的另一新战争工具——“太平洋公约”了。日本反动派所以敢于如此放肆，是受到美国帝国主义直接鼓励的缘故。
    不仅如此，在美国的积极帮助下，日本已在许多方面对亚洲尤其是中国进行了实际的侵略活动，变成了美国在远东实行帝国主义政策的得力助手和中美反动派屠杀中国人民的刽子手。日本战犯前中国派遣军司令冈村宁次曾充当蒋介石的顾问，并曾直接指挥国民党匪军作战。前年七月初，美国为台湾招来了两船日本“特别移民”，内有日本战犯前台湾总督长谷川清及其他日本军政人员，以建造台湾的军事基地，开发台湾的资源，帮助美国训练蒋匪军队。去年三月，麦克阿瑟又派遣日本侵华要犯，前日本驻沪总领事堀内干城等，充当宋匪子文的顾问，堀内就任后曾返日招聘大批专家赴粤，帮助美蒋开发海南岛。同时，大批日寇官兵直接参加了蒋介石的反人民内战。
    从上述各方面简单而极不完全的材料中，已经足够证实：在美国将近四年的单独而专横的管制下，日本正在完全变成美国帝国主义的“远东兵工厂”和准备新战争冒险的重要基地，这就严重地威胁着远东首先是中国的安全，也威胁着日本人民的生存和安全。目前，美国正更公开地拒绝准备对日和约，企图以长期占领日本来贯彻这一帝国主义的罪恶政策。因此，中国人民应该团结起来，与亚洲人民和日本人民进一步联合，跟美帝国主义这一与世界人民首先是亚洲人民为敌的扶日政策进行坚决的斗争。必须与世界民主和平阵营的领导者苏联一起，要求迅速召开四国对日和约准备会议，立即草拟肃清日本军国主义和使日本民主化的对日和约，为确保远东和世界的持久和平而斗争。　　（新华社北平五日电）
