Strengthen the Maintenance of Highways

Zhang Wen'ang, Deputy Minister of Communications Department of the North China People's Government

    In coordination with the victory of the People's Liberation War, the highways and cart roads connecting various cities and towns in the North China region have been gradually repaired and opened to traffic in recent years. Especially after the Pingjin Campaign, the Taiyuan Campaign, and the military tasks of the southward advance of the army, the major highway lines in the North China region have been largely or completely repaired. The total length of roads open to traffic has reached 14,400 kilometers, far exceeding the 8,100 kilometers before the war. However, most of these highways were damaged, and the newly built highways repaired in the early stages of the Liberation War were completed in a short period of time. Therefore, they are still not very standardized. The road surface is made of earth, and most of the bridges are temporary. Judging from the current economic conditions, the focus of highway construction work in the future, for a certain period, will be on road maintenance. As long as the road maintenance work is done well, and gradual improvements are made with emphasis on key areas, then the existing length and wide distribution of the highways can fulfill the task of material exchange between urban and rural areas. However, there are still chaotic phenomena in terms of understanding and coordination in the current construction and highway management work, which urgently need to be studied and overcome:

    (1) Some technical personnel and management personnel admire the large bridges, solid roadbeds, and massive projects of railways, and want to try their hand at building an ideal highway with permanent bridges and solid road surfaces. When higher authorities cannot approve it, they become unwilling to work and do not think of ways to do the current road maintenance work well, thinking that road maintenance is too simple and not a matter for senior technical personnel. If this kind of unrealistic and overambitious way of thinking and working style is not overcome, it will be impossible to maintain the highways well.

    Is a relatively standardized highway with complete bridges and culverts and a primary gravel road surface needed? Of course, it would be good to have it. However, the cost of improving such a highway is at least 125,000 jin of millet per kilometer (excluding the cost of transporting gravel). At the current stage of economic development in North China's urban and rural areas, such a large financial investment is impossible and unnecessary. However, it is absolutely necessary to manage the existing highways well, maintain them well, ensure that they are not damaged, and gradually build standard bridges and culverts on necessary rivers with a focus on key areas, based on the principle of "users maintain roads" by levying some road maintenance fees, with government subsidies for major projects. At the same time, in road maintenance work, inspections and repairs should be carried out at any time, and the responsible persons should practically study the work in their sections, achieving technical "preparedness," finding ways to shorten the interruption time during the rainy season. Frequent repair work will turn large projects into small ones, saving expenses. And it is necessary to "use local materials," practically solve problems, conduct frequent surveys and investigations, ensure accurate budgets, and carry out improvement projects year after year in coordination with the needs of economic development. Inferior highways will become good highways. Abandoning this down-to-earth working method and fantasizing about comprehensive projects is bound to fail. Some people believe that reconstruction should be carried out after production development, which will also lead to huge waste and irreparable losses, and must be overcome.

    (2) Highways must be maintained regularly after they are built. The source of road maintenance funds should be based on the principle of "users maintain roads." The focus must be on road maintenance. Resolutely prevent the Kuomintang-style "only manage but not maintain" and "maintain people but not roads" working styles from attacking. "Repair, manage, and maintain" should be carried out with emphasis and in a planned manner. In coordination with the needs of economic development and the recovery of railway transportation, highways should be extended into rural and remote areas, forming transportation capillaries, rather than just repairing and maintaining a few main lines. However, the management should be based on the economic value, with fewer or no management personnel. In remote mountainous highways, except for a few main lines, there are not many automobile rubber-tired vehicles. It is also not necessary to restrict the passage of iron-wheeled vehicles. It is necessary to oppose the egalitarian distribution method. Iron-wheeled vehicles should be strictly prohibited from traveling on the earth-surfaced highways with a large amount of transportation in the plains. However, in mountainous areas where there are not many automobile rubber-tired vehicles and mainly iron-wheeled vehicles pass, and there is no separate road for iron-wheeled vehicles, iron-wheeled vehicles should be allowed to travel, but road maintenance work should be particularly strengthened.

    Road maintenance work must be combined with the masses and transformed into a mass road protection work under leadership. In addition to the prescribed reward and punishment methods, road maintenance personnel should regularly conduct traffic education work for the masses along the road, such as the meaning of collecting road maintenance fees, common sense of traffic discipline, and the economic effects of prohibiting a few iron-wheeled vehicles from traveling on highways. The North China region is transitioning from a wartime environment to a construction stage. Traffic education work will certainly be difficult at the beginning, but it is necessary. Without the support of the masses along the way, road maintenance personnel will inevitably be isolated and unable to maintain the roads well. Currently, road maintenance work has just begun, the work is not deep enough, and the road maintenance fees collected are not enough to cover road maintenance expenses. Personnel in each section must find ways to study methods. Especially when the rainy season comes, income decreases and projects increase, it is even more necessary to overcome difficulties in conjunction with the masses.

    (3) Management personnel must overcome shortcomings such as "no way to manage well," handling affairs according to regulations, and not studying or improving their work style. All stations must study the economic needs of the masses, help and organize the masses to solve the difficulties of unfamiliarity for passengers, goods, and merchants, unify the allocation of vehicles and goods, eliminate the competition among automobile merchants that reduces transportation efficiency, simplify office procedures, shorten vehicle inspection time and frequency, and facilitate the travel of staff and the transportation of passengers and goods. Truly achieve convenient transportation and increase the masses' trust in highway stations. It is necessary to oppose the bad habits left over from the Kuomintang, such as automobile merchants trying to evade taxes and donations, management personnel scolding and beating transportation workers, and extorting passengers and merchants. As long as the personnel in our highway transportation management work strengthen the concept of serving the people and a mass-based style of work, we have all the conditions to do our work well.

　　加强护养公路
    华北人民政府交通部副部长张文昂
    配合着人民解放战争的胜利，连贯华北区各城乡间的公路、大车路，已经在近几年来逐步的修复通车，特别是经过平津战役、太原战役和大军南下的军事任务以后，华北区主要公路干线已经大部或全部加以修整，通车路线长达一万四千四百公里，远较战前的八千一百公里为长。但这些公路绝大部分经过破坏，在解放战争初期修整的新建的公路，均为短期内所完成，因此还很不正规，路面是土的，桥梁大部是临时性的，且就目前经济条件来看，今后在一定时期内，公路建设工作，重心在于养路，只要把养路工作作好，逐步的有重点的进行改善工程，那么就现有的公路线之长，分布之广，是可以完成城乡物资交流的任务的。可是目前建设与公路管理工作上，仍然存在着认识上的和步调上的混乱现象，亟应提出研究并加以克服：
    （一）一部分技术人员与管理人员，羡慕铁路的大桥，巩固的路基，庞大的工程，就想一试身手，做一条理想的公路，建筑永久性的桥梁，和巩固的路面，在上级不能批准时，就产生了不安心工作，不去想办法把现实的养路做好，认为养路工程太简单，不是高等技术人员的事，这种好高骛远不切实际的思想方法与作风，不加克服，是无法护养好公路的。
    一条比较正规的，桥涵俱全的，初级碎石路面的公路是否需要呢？有自然是好的，可是改善这样的公路工程费，每公里起码要十二万五千斤小米（碎石运输费尚不在内），在华北城乡经济并非高度的发展的现阶段，如此庞大的财政投资，是不可能且不必要的，但把现在已有的公路很好的管理起来，修养好，保证不被破坏，有重点的加以改善，在必要的河流上，逐渐的建筑正规的桥涵，本用路者养路原则，征收些养路费，在重大工程上政府加以补助，是完全必要的。同时，在养路工作上，应随时检查，随时修整，实际负责研究自己的管段工作，做到技术上的“未雨绸缪”，想办法缩短雨季断车时间，经常的修补工作，会把大工程变小，节省经费开支，并且要“就地取材”。实际解决问题，进行经常的勘测调查，预算要准确，配合着经济发展的需要，逐年累月的进行改善工程，劣等公路会变成良好的公路。抛开这种脚踏实地的工作方法，空想全面的工程，是一定会落空的。有些人员认为要在生产发展后再重新建筑，也是会形成巨大的浪费和不能弥补的损失的，必需加以克服。
    （二）公路修好，一定要经常保养，养路费来源，应本用路者养路原则抽取，重点一定要放在养路，坚决防止国民党式的“只管不养”、“养人不养路”作风的袭击，要有重点的有计划地进行“修管养”，配合经济发展需要和铁路运输恢复的情况，把公路深入到乡村僻地，形成运输微血管，而不是仅仅修养几条干线，但管理方面需视经济价值大小，少设或不设管理人员，偏僻山地公路，除几条干线外，汽车胶皮轮大车不多，也不必限制铁轮车辆通行，一定要反对平均主义的布置方法，在平原运输多的土面公路上应严禁铁轮车行走，但在山地汽车胶皮轮不多，主要通行铁轮车的地方，同时又没有给铁轮另辟大路的条件下，应让铁轮车行走，但应特别加强养路工作。
    养路工作一定要与群众结合，变成有领导的群众性的护路工作，除了规定的赏罚办法以外，养路人员要对沿路群众经常进行交通教育工作，例如征纳养路费之意义，交通纪律常识，以及禁止少数铁轮车行驶公路、经济效果等。华北区从战争环境今后转入建设阶段，交通教育工作开始一定是艰苦的，然而是必要的，没有沿途群众的支持，养路人员一定是要陷入孤立地位，无法把路养好，目前养路工作仅仅开始，工作不够深入，所收的养路费还不够养路开支，各管段人员还须设法研究办法，特别雨季来临，收入减低，工程加多，更需结合群众克服困难。
    （三）管理人员要克服“无办法管理好”，照章办事，不研究不改进的工作作风等缺点，各所站一定要研究群众经济的需要，帮助与组织群众解决客货商人生地疏的困难，统一车货调配，消除汽车商间的减低运输效能的竞争，简化办公手续，缩短车辆检查时间与次数，便利工作人员乘车及客货商运，真正做到交通便利，增进群众对公路所站的信赖，要反对国民党遗留的恶劣习气，如汽车商人设法避税逃捐，管理人员打骂运输工人，敲诈勒索客商等违法行为，只要我们公路运输管理工作的人员，加强为人民服务的观点和群众化的作风，我们是有一切条件可以把工作做好的。
