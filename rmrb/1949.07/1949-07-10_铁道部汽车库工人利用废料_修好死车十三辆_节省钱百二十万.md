Railway Ministry Auto Depot Workers Use Scrap Materials to Repair Thirteen "Dead" Vehicles, Saving 1.2 Million Yuan

[This newspaper report] The workers of the Railway Ministry's Auto Depot have been actively engaged in production, voluntarily repairing thirteen trucks that were unusable, saving more than 1.20 million yuan. This depot originally belonged to the Pinghan Railway Auto Business Office. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, all the vehicles were dilapidated, with as many as twenty-nine vehicles out of service and never repaired. After the liberation of Beiping, under the leadership of the Ministry of Railways, the workers of the depot worked hard to learn, and their class consciousness gradually increased. Responding to the call for production and construction, they voluntarily selected eighteen outstanding drivers and workers, including Li Shuguang, and formulated a plan to repair the broken trucks left behind by the Kuomintang. Starting work on May 19th, based on the principle of thrift, they made every effort to use discarded scrap materials and parts. Despite the difficult conditions of lacking tools, they worked actively, arriving early for work and leaving late, without rest on holidays. Finally, on June 30th, they completed the plan, repairing eight "dead" vehicles, each estimated to be worth about 150,000 yuan in People's Currency, totaling 1.2 million yuan. However, the actual cost of labor and materials was only 385,486 yuan, saving 804,514 yuan. The workers of the depot's repair department, including Yin Xinghan and others, similarly repaired five broken trucks that had been out of service for more than half a year. The estimated repair cost was 600,000 yuan, but it only cost 212,140 yuan for labor and materials, saving 387,860 yuan. They have already driven these thirteen repaired trucks out of the factory for exhibition on the anniversary of the July 7th Incident.

　　铁道部汽车库工人利用废料
  　修好死车十三辆　节省钱百二十万
    【本报讯】铁道部汽车库工人积极生产，自动修复了不能使用的卡车十三辆，节省了人民币一百二十万零二千余元。该库原属平汉铁路汽车营业所，在国民党反动统治下，所有汽车破烂不堪，停驶车辆竟达二十九部，从不加以修理。北平解放后，该库工人在铁道部的领导下，努力学习，阶级觉悟日见提高，他们响应生产建设的号召，自动选出优秀的司机工人李树光等十八名，订出修复国民党遗留下来的破卡车计划。从五月十九日动工，依据节约的原则，尽量利用遗弃废料、零件，在工具缺乏的困难条件下，积极工作，上班早，下班晚，假期不休息，终于在六月三十日完成计划，修复死车八辆，每辆估价约人民券十五万元，共人民券一百二十万元；但实际只花了工料费三十八万五千四百八十六元，节省了八十万四千五百一十四元。该库修理部工人尹兴汉等七人也同样的把停驶多半年的破卡车修好五台，修费估价需用六十万元，但仅费工料钱二十一万二千一百四十元，节省了三十八万七千八百六十元。他们已于七七纪念日把这十三辆修好的卡车开出厂外展览。
