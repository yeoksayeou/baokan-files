    Guangping Wastes Resources and Manpower to Build Theater
    County Head Li Liangcai and Others Disciplined
    North China People's Government Notifies All Regions to Rectify Work Style
    [This Newspaper's Report] Based on the investigation report of the Jinnan Working Group of the People's Supervision Institute, the North China People's Government found that Guangping County in the region had arbitrarily built a large theater (or assembly hall), wasting resources and manpower. It has issued disciplinary actions to the parties involved and, in addition to ordering the Jinnan Administrative Office to implement it, has notified governments and units at all levels.
    Guangping County is a small city where industry, commerce, and transportation are underdeveloped, and the lives of its citizens are very poor. In the winter of 1947, County Head Wang Qinsheng and County Party Secretary Comrade Su decided to build a fairly elaborate theater (or assembly hall), including fourteen rooms of bungalows and multi-story buildings, capable of accommodating more than two thousand people, under the guise of building an assembly hall. The construction of this project was not requested for instructions. After Wang and Su made the decision, Zhou Liangchen of the County Party Committee and Shi Shu, the secretary of the County Government, took charge of the construction, aiming to build a house for holding county-wide mass meetings, so they expanded it as much as possible. Construction was suspended in November due to some reason. After the wheat harvest of the following year, Wang and Su had been transferred elsewhere. The succeeding County Head Li Liangcai and County Party Comrade Yang continued the construction. They had talked to Minister Kang of the Organization Department of the Third Prefectural Committee beforehand and asked Commissioner Sun for instructions. Sun instructed them to make a budget first. The county bought things first and then made a budget, resulting in huge expenditures. They reported to the commissioner for approval to forward the request to the Administrative Office. During this period, the Third Prefectural Committee approved it. When the Administrative Office disapproved, the theater was already under construction. Thus, the construction was completed under the circumstances where the lower levels did not comply with the instructions and the higher levels did not inquire. In addition to dismantling and transporting part of the old buildings, some materials were purchased for the construction; in addition to using some voluntary labor, some masons, plumbers, carpenters, etc. were hired. The total expenditure for labor and materials was 68,866 jin of rice. Based on the above facts, the North China People's Government holds that former County Head Wang Qinsheng, without asking for instructions or approval, arbitrarily built a large theater (or assembly hall) that the local area did not need, wasting resources and manpower, arousing public dissatisfaction, and showing no concern for the people's hardships and wasting public funds, which was a mistake and should bear the main responsibility. Although he has been transferred elsewhere, his behavior of being without government and without discipline should still be investigated and given a demerit. The current County Head Li Liangcai violated the agricultural season, disregarded the busy summer farming season, and arbitrarily mobilized migrant workers, and also did not comply with the instructions of the higher-level government, spending first and then reporting for reimbursement, and continued the construction. Although he was not the initiator, he was also behaving without discipline and without government, wasting manpower, and should be given a warning. The Special Commissioner's Office and the Administrative Office did not know the details of the county's construction, and should also conduct inspections on their leadership to rectify the work style.

    广平劳民伤财擅建戏院
    县长李良才等受处分
    华北人民政府通报各地整肃政风
    【本报讯】华北人民政府据人民监察院冀南工作组调查报告，该区广平县擅自建筑大戏院（或大会场），劳民伤财，特予当事人以处分，除令饬冀南行署遵照执行外，并通报各级政府，各单位。
    广平县系一工商业交通均不发达之小城市，市民生活甚贫苦，于三十六年冬，经县长王勤生和县委书记苏同志决定，以盖会场为名，于城内建筑相当讲究的包括平房、楼房共十四间，约可容两千余人之大戏院（或大会场）。该项建筑未经请示，由王、苏决定后，即由县委会周良臣及县府秘书史述主持动工，为要修建一能开全县群众大会用的房子，故尽量扩大，到十一月间，因故停工。翌年麦收后，王、苏已他调，接任县长李良才和县委杨同志继续建筑，事前曾和三地委会组织部康部长谈过，又向孙专员请示，孙嘱先造算。该县则先买东西后造预算，致使开支巨大，报请专员批示准予转请行署，在此期间即由三地委会许可，待行署批示不准时，戏院正在建筑中，于是就在下级未遵批示、上级也没问的情况下建筑竣工。该项建筑所用材料除拆运旧建筑一部外，尚采购一部；除用一部义务工外，尚雇用泥水铁木工等一部，工料两项合计共开支米六万八千八百六十六斤。根据以上事实，华北人民政府以前任县长王勤生不经请示批准，擅自兴修该地方并不需要之大戏院（或大会场），劳民伤财，引起群众不满，不恤民艰，浪费公款，实属错误，应负主要责任。现虽他调，其无政府无纪律行为，仍应予以追究，给予记过处分。现任县长李良才违误农时，不顾夏耕农忙，擅自动员民工，复不遵上级政府批示，先开支后报销，继续兴修，虽非始谋者，亦属无纪律无政府行为，浪费民力，应予警告处分。专署、行署对该县此项建筑均不知底细，在领导上亦应进行检查，以肃政风。
