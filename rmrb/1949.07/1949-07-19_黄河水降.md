[Ji Lu Yu Electric Dispatch] The first surge of water in the Yellow River since entering the flood season gradually receded from the 9th to the 11th, falling below the water level of July 1st. For example, the water level at Shanzhou on July 1st was 292.82 meters, and on July 11th it was 292.29 meters. This surge was very strong, but all dangerous levee sections were intensely reinforced and repaired, so no major problems occurred.

    黄河水降
    【冀鲁豫电】黄河进入伏汛期以来的第一次涨水，至九日到十一日先后逐渐下降，降到低于七月一日之水位。如陕州七月一日水位为二九二点八二公尺，十一日为二九二点二九公尺。此次涨水很猛，但各险工堤段都紧张地抢修护补，所以未出大乱子。
