　　North China People's Government Accepts Readers' Accusation to
    Thoroughly Investigate the Corruption of the Pseudo-Finance Minister
    Wang Zijun Couldn't Deny It and Spilled the Loot
    [Report from this Newspaper] On April 19th, this newspaper's "Voice of the Masses" disclosed a letter from former employees of the pseudo-Hebei Provincial Government accusing Wang Zijun, the pseudo-Finance Minister, of embezzling flour from the employees' cooperative. After investigation by personnel dispatched by the North China People's Government, and after repeated presentation of conclusive evidence by representatives of the old employees of the department to Wang Zijun, Wang Zijun has admitted his mistakes and is willing to hand over the flour in full, to be disposed of by the employees themselves. According to the facts, before the Dragon Boat Festival last year, the employees of the department borrowed more than 300 million pseudo-currency from the department in the name of the cooperative, and purchased 150 bags of flour. It was stated at the time that losses would be shared by everyone, and profits would be distributed to everyone. Later, Wang Zijun embezzled it, lining his own pockets. Until after the liberation of Beiping, the employees had not received the flour, and everyone felt indignant. They elected representatives to negotiate with Wang Zijun. Wang used various methods to deny it, such as saying that the flour was bought with public money and did not belong to the cooperative, and others had no right to interfere, attempting to completely dismiss the matter. He also used various vile means, even shameless rumors, to threaten employees, carrying out conspiracies to divide the employees. Later, he fabricated accounts, saying that the flour had been distributed to department and section personnel as rewards. This aroused the public indignation of all employees. The representatives pointed out to Wang that if the flour did not belong to the cooperative, why did the manager and deputy manager of the cooperative submit a request for a loan? Furthermore, the flour distributed to department and section personnel was not from the cooperative, and Wang Zijun was only a member of the cooperative and had no right to privately use everyone's flour to reward his subordinates. They collected evidence and repeatedly exposed his corrupt face. Wang finally, due to the undeniable facts and under the pressure of public opinion, admitted his mistakes and was willing to hand over all the materials. After the satisfactory resolution of this matter, the old employees of the department expressed their gratitude to the personnel dispatched by the North China People's Government for their assistance in handling the matter. They believed that only under the leadership of the People's Government can the corrupt phenomena of the old society be eliminated. They unanimously resolved to contribute 44 bags of flour, two bolts of light yellow twill cloth, and sixteen bars of soap (totaling 186,910 yuan after conversion) from the recovered materials to support the army, and the remainder will be distributed reasonably among everyone.

　　华北人民政府接受本报读者控告
  　澈查伪财政厅长贪污
    王子均抵赖不过倒出赃物
    【本报讯】四月十九日本报“群众呼声”披露了前伪河北省政府职员控告伪财政厅长王子均贪污员工合作社面粉的一封信，经华北人民政府派员查询，和该厅旧员工代表数度向王子均提出确凿证据后，王子均已承认错误，并愿将是项面粉如数交出，由员工自行处理。按去岁五月节前，该厅员工以合作社名义，向厅里借到伪法币三亿多元，购得面粉一百五十袋，当时言明，赔了大家摊，赚了大家分，后为王子均所贪污中饱，直至北平解放后，员工仍未分到面粉，大家一致感到愤慨，乃推派代表与王子均交涉。王竟采用各种方法抵赖，如说：该项面粉是公家钱所买，不属于合作社，别人无权过问，企图把此事完全推开，并用种种卑污手段甚至无耻的造谣威胁员工，进行分裂员工的阴谋；后又假造帐目，说是已将面粉分赏科秘人员。引起全体员工的公愤，经代表向王指出：面粉既不是合作社的，为何由合作社经理副经理签呈借款？再分赏科秘人员的不是合作社的面粉，而且王子均只是合作社的一分子，无权私自用大家的面粉分赏下属。并搜集证据一再揭露其贪污面目，王终因事实俱在，无法抵赖，并慑于舆论压迫，最后才承认错误，愿将全部物资交出。该厅旧员工于此事圆满解决后，对华北人民政府派员协助处理，甚表感激，认为只有在人民政府的领导之下才能肃清旧社会的贪污现象，一致决议将缴回的物资提出四十四袋面粉和两匹淡黄斜文布、肥皂十六条（共变价十八万六千九百一十元）劳军，余数由大家合理分配。
