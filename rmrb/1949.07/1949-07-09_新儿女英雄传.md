　　New Heroes and Heroines
    Chapter Nineteen: The Great Counter-Offensive
    To fight on the point of a needle,
    To live a life on the edge of a knife,
    Spreading caltrops,
    Covering with thorns,
    The Japanese devils have oppressed us until now!
    Hoping today,
    Hoping tomorrow,
    Counting on our fingers,
    ...The Eighth Route Army is here!
    　　　——Folksong
    I
    Not long after Yang Xiaomei was arrested, China's best friend – the Soviet Union – sent troops from the Far East to fight Japan alongside us. In just a few days, Japan announced its surrender. What joyful news!
    However, the Japanese devils and traitors still occupied our cities and strongholds, refusing to surrender their weapons. Leading cadres from various districts in the county went to the county seat for a meeting. Black Cai, the county party secretary, said that if the enemy refuses to surrender, we will annihilate them! Commander-in-Chief Zhu has already issued an order to launch a full-scale counter-offensive; all armies are mobilized. Our local county and district detachments must be transferred and reorganized into regular troops to fight in the big cities with the main forces. The militias of each village should quickly organize militia companies, with Party members and branch committee members taking the lead. The district chief and district party secretary will lead the team, unified under the command of the county party committee, to launch an offensive immediately and take down the county seat here.
    Comrades accepted this task, extremely excited. Braving the heavy rain, they rushed back to their districts overnight. Niu Dashui remembered Yang Xiaomei and Little Pang, and his heart was filled with hope at the thought of taking the city. Truly, the War of Resistance was about to be won, people would be reunited, and things would be resolved!
    Back in the district, they summoned the district detachment to relay the message. The team members jumped for joy and said, "Great, great, the War of Resistance is almost over. Let's give it our all, the Japanese devils are finished!" "Hey, the little devils can't stand the sun!" "Haha, we're becoming real Eighth Routers! Let's get ready to go."
    The team members were happily busy packing their bags. The task was urgent, and no one had time to go home to take a look; even Ma Dansiao didn't bring it up. He happily wound his bullet belt, carried his bag, picked up his gun, and said to those around him with a smile, "I'm a real Eighth Route soldier now, whoever calls me Ma Dansiao again, I'll knock them on the head!" Niu Dashui, fully armed and looking spirited, patted Ma Dansiao and said, "You're really not timid now, from now on we'll call you Ma Dan-da (Ma the Bold)."
    District Chief Jiao of this district had served in the army. The higher-ups designated him to lead the district detachment to the county seat for assembly. Each of them carried captured Type 38 rifles and set off overnight.
    Here, Gao Tun'er was the acting district chief. Dashui and he, drenched in rain and stepping in mud, went to various villages to mobilize the militia. After the major rent reduction and production campaign, the peasants' lives had improved, and their anti-Japanese sentiment was particularly high, so the militia had also expanded. Many new activists, like Wei Dameng and Liu Xier, had even become militia captains. When Dashui and Gao Tun'er arrived in the villages and relayed the message about the counter-offensive to those captains, they were overjoyed and immediately mobilized the militia. Overnight, they gathered more than one hundred and fifty people and organized the first militia company. Dashui and Gao Tun'er appointed Wei Dameng as the first platoon leader, Liu Xier as the second platoon leader, and Hu Erniu as the third platoon leader. Before dawn, the first company set off for the designated location.
    II
    They arrived at Li Gongdi, boarded a boat, and went around to the west of the county seat, to Wuzhuangzi, four li from the city. The rain had stopped, the sun was high in the sky, and it was already midday. This was an enemy-occupied area. Dashui and Gao Tun'er told the boatmen to hide in the reeds, and they themselves went ashore to scout the situation.
    As they approached the village, they ran into two villagers in the field, a young man who was putting away his plough, and an old man sitting beside him eating. When the young man saw them coming with guns, he quickly picked up his plough and left. The old man also stood up hurriedly, picked up his things in a fluster, and also wanted to slip away. Gao Tun'er shouted, "Uncle, don't go! Let's talk." They pretended not to hear and walked faster.
    Dashui and Gao Tun'er caught up with them and said, "Don't be afraid! We are the Eighth Route Army, we're asking you where the village office is." When the old man and the young man heard that they were the Eighth Route Army, they stopped and looked at Dashui and the others suspiciously. The old man stammered, "There is no village office in our village." Gao Tun'er anxiously asked, "Don't you have anyone who works for the village?" The old man said, "Even if there is, they're not at home, they're all working in the fields." Saying that, he wanted to leave again. Gao Tun'er stopped them and patiently asked, "Why are you two in such a hurry to leave?" The old man hesitated and said, "We're not leaving, we're just going home to rest after we're done." Dashui remembered that there was a man named Lin in this village, who had come to our area in the past, and Dashui had helped him solve a problem. He brought up Old Lin, asked where he lived, and explained for a long time. Only then did the young man's frown ease, and he immediately led them to find Old Lin.
    Old Lin was eating when he saw Dashui and the others coming. He stood up quickly and asked Dashui happily, "Have you eaten? Where are you coming from?" Dashui said, "We want to understand the situation." Old Lin said, "The Japanese devils and traitors are much more 'relaxed' now, and they rarely dare to come out." The young man looked at Dashui and the others and smiled, saying, "Ha, the real Eighth Route Army has come, I thought it was fake!" After saying that, he ran out happily.
    Dashui asked Old Lin, "We have more than one hundred and fifty people, is it okay to eat a meal in your place?" Old Lin said with a smile, "It's okay to eat several meals. I'm still working in the village office, so there's no problem."
    Dashui and Gao Tun'er brought the militia company into the village. The young man had already spread the news, and the people heard that the Eighth Route Army had arrived, and they all came to watch. The old man who had been met in the field, grinning, insisted on taking Dashui to his house for a meal. Gao Tun'er asked with a smile, "Old uncle, aren't you afraid of us?" The old man quickly said, "Tsk, we're not afraid of the Eighth Route Army, we're afraid of the Japanese devils and traitors! They always pretend to be the Eighth Route Army to fool people, they've scared us out of our wits. In our area, bad people are in charge, even dung beetles sting people!"
    Dashui and Gao Tun'er posted sentries, and Old Lin arranged for the soldiers to rest in the homes of the people. Every family took out the white flour they had hidden, some made pancakes, and some made noodles. The people all said, "We've been hoping day and night, finally we've waited for the Eighth Route Army!" The soldiers were delighted and said with a smile, "We didn't expect the people in the enemy-occupied areas to be so good too. We can't let the people down!"
    After eating, a notice came from the county: the first company was to be transferred to Zhangzhuang. Dashui and the others quickly took a boat there. Comrades from the county party committee were already waiting there. Gao Tun'er was formally appointed as the company commander, and Niu Dashui as the political instructor and deputy company commander. They also conveyed the order from the higher-ups, saying that all companies must take action tonight and begin to besiege the outer strongholds of the county seat. The target of the first company was the watchtower in Baima Village, and they should try to get the puppet soldiers on the tower to surrender. At the same time, they should prevent the enemy in the city from escaping in this direction. The slogan was: "Don't let a single enemy escape!" After the instructions were given, the comrades from the county party committee left.
    That night, the watchtowers near the county seat were either surrounded or controlled by the newly organized militia companies. Baima Village was an important location, seven li from the city, and the waterway and land route from the city to Baoding passed through here. The village was surrounded by water on all sides, and only a large stone bridge connected to the road on the embankment. Dashui and Gao Tun'er sent Wei Dameng's platoon to occupy the houses on the embankment opposite Baima Village, control the stone bridge, and block the gate of the watchtower. They also sent Liu Xier's platoon to Huangzhuang, two li from the city along the embankment, to guard against the enemy in the city and prevent them from escaping. The remaining platoon of Hu Erniu followed the company headquarters, and fifteen large and small boats remained in Zhangzhuang for mobile use. Everyone in the company wore white towels tied on their left arms as a signal. The prescribed password was: "Counter-offensive." It was raining at night. Platoon leaders Wei Dameng and Liu Xier led their platoons spiritedly.
    III
    Dashui and Gao Tun'er hadn't slept all night, and they had been busy all day, so now that the work had been arranged, they were very tired. Gao Tun'er had a pistol slung around his neck, leaned on the kang, and yawned widely. Dashui sat on the edge of the kang, leaning against the wall, yawning several times in a row. His eyes were sore and painful, and he was also very sleepy.
    Outside, the rain was falling incessantly. The wind blew in from the broken window, making the small oil lamp flicker. Dashui felt drowsy and thought of Xiaomei and her daughter, locked in jail, wondering how they were. If they could take the city this time and rescue them, how happy it would be for the family to be reunited! But then he thought: He Shi Xiong, that die-hard traitor, is too cruel, maybe he'll strike before the city is taken, then we won't see them!
    Thinking of this, he felt restless and uneasy, and his sleepiness vanished. Listening to the rain outside getting heavier and heavier, the window paper was all wet. He turned up the lamp and walked back and forth in the room. Suddenly, he thought of the soldiers getting rained on, and he wondered how they were doing. He hurriedly woke up Gao Tun'er and said, "The rain is so heavy; they are all new soldiers, let's go and see them."
    Gao Tun'er mumbled, "How to go?" Dashui said with a smile, "How to go! Are you expecting a car? Of course, we'll go in the rain. Grasping the soldiers' morale is important at this time!" Gao Tun'er jumped off the kang and said, "Okay, let's go!" He took a messenger to the stone bridge. Dashui temporarily settled the affairs of the company headquarters with Hu Erniu, and he himself took a messenger and went to Huangzhuang.
    It was very dark outside, and the rain was pouring down, making it difficult to open one's eyes. The embankment was very slippery, and the two kept falling in the mud. They took off their shoes and walked barefoot, but there were many caltrops and wild jujube thorns on the embankment, which hurt a lot. The messenger, Little Li, said, "Instructor, shouldn't we avoid the rain?" Dashui said, "No, let's hold hands and walk. We're almost there, see if they are on guard on the embankment."
    After walking for a while, a voice suddenly shouted in the darkness, "Password!" Little Li said, "We are!" The other side pulled the bolt and shouted, "Stop! If you don't stop, I'll shoot!" Dashui quickly answered the password. The other side said, "Come forward."
    They walked over and saw a militiaman drenched to the bone, wearing a pointed straw hat, squatting under a wild jujube tree, holding a large gun. Seeing them coming, he stood up and said, "Ah, Instructor! Why are you here?" Dashui said with a smile, "I came to see you. It's raining so hard, you must be drenched!" The militiaman said, "Ha, you're not afraid of getting wet, we're even less afraid!"
    While they were talking, the rain lessened. Dashui asked, "Where are they all?" The militiaman pointed and said, "They're all in front." Little Platoon Leader Liu Xier ran from the embankment and asked, "Who is it?" The militiaman said, "The instructor is here." Liu Xier said, "Instructor, it's raining so hard, why are you here?" Dashui said, "The soldiers were just transferred from the villages, and as soon as they came, they ran into such heavy rain, I'm worried!"
    Liu Xier said with a smile, "It doesn't matter, everyone's morale is very high, no problem!" Dashui said, "Let's go and see." They walked over, and the militiamen were all squatting on the embankment slope, sheltered from the wind. There were also two sentries in front, monitoring the city. A group of people stood up and said, "Good, you came in such heavy rain!"
    Most of them were Communist Party members. Dashui was very happy to see that they were guarding their posts with spirit. He said, "You're really good! Aren't you afraid of getting wet?" Everyone said, "Hey, we're all farmers, what's there to be afraid of!" Liu Xier said comically, "That's good, this rain will make us grow stronger!" Everyone laughed. A small militiaman said, "This rain has another benefit, you can drink water as soon as you open your mouth!" Liu Xier said with a smile, "That's right! Rainwater makes tea, the taste of heaven." Dashui thought, "This young man is like Shuangxi." He was filled with joy and said to everyone, "You must pay attention, don't get sick, and fail to complete the task." They said, "Don't worry, Instructor, we know these things."
    Dashui urged, "Our post is very important. If the enemy retreats from the city and runs to Baoding, they must pass through here. Be especially careful when it's about to dawn. Don't fall asleep at that time, get sick from the cold, and suffer losses when the enemy comes. The rain has stopped now, don't just stay here. Walk around and get some exercise." The soldiers all said, "Don't worry, Instructor, we know these things."
    Dashui and the others walked back, and they wanted to see them off. Dashui said with a smile, "No need to see us off, we're leaving."
    IV
    When Niu Dashui returned to the company headquarters, it was still dark. The lights were on in the room. As soon as he entered, Gao Tun'er jumped up and said, "Dashui, I was so worried waiting for you! This is terrible!" Dashui asked him in surprise what was wrong. Gao Tun'er said, "Wei Dameng pulled his whole platoon into Baima Village!" Dashui said anxiously, "Isn't that bad?" Gao Tun'er stomped his feet and said, "Isn't it bad after all that!" Dashui said, "If the enemy blockades the stone bridge, then they won't be able to get out!" Gao Tun'er stared and said, "Isn't it just that they can't get out!"
    Dashui was so angry that he couldn't speak. Gao Tun'er said angrily, "The platoon was pulled in, but the platoon leader ran back!" Dashui said, "Why didn't you say so earlier! Quickly call him and ask!" The messenger immediately called Wei Dameng.
    Wei Dameng's wet clothes were sticking to his body, not yet dry. As soon as he came in, Dashui asked him, "Platoon Leader, what was the task we gave you?" Wei Dameng knew he was wrong and pouted, saying, "You told me to blockade the stone bridge." Dashui said, "Then why did you pull the team in? Since you pulled them in, why did you come out again?" Wei Dameng panicked and stammered, "I... came to report... Didn't you tell me to besiege the enemy? Everyone said, how can we hit the enemy outside? It's better to run in and encircle the tortoise den, and if they have no food or water, won't they be besieged! I... I just didn't think about the terrain!"
    Gao Tun'er slapped his leg and said, "You thought well! If the enemy blockades the stone bridge and reinforcements come to block it, wouldn't those fourteen people inside be like turtles in a jar?" Wei Dameng said dejectedly, "Damn it, that's right! If the bridge is blocked, they can't get out!" Gao Tun'er said, "What do you think we should do?" Wei Dameng scratched his head and suddenly remembered, "Can't our people swim out?" Gao Tun'er said angrily, "Can you swim that far? You'd have to throw away your guns. And what about those who can't swim? You've made a mess of things!"
    Wei Dameng didn't say anything, put his rifle on the ground, squatted down, and lowered his head. Dashui thought for a while and said, "Dameng, rush into the village again before dawn and command that platoon, you'll be responsible for any losses!" Gao Tun'er waved his hand and said, "Go in immediately and bring out this platoon, you don't have to come back if you can't bring them out!" Dashui said, "If you rush in and it's dawn, you don't have to come out." Wei Dameng stood up and said firmly, "I'll go!" And he left.
    Here, Instructor Niu said to Company Commander Gao, "We have to unify our command in the future. I told him to go in and command, and you told him to bring the people out. What if there are losses?" Gao Tun'er understood and said regretfully, "Really, what time is it, it's almost dawn, what should we do?" Dashui said, "I'm not sure he can even rush in!"
    The two were discussing when the window paper turned white. Suddenly, they heard several gunshots. Gao Tun'er said, "It's bad! They're fighting!" He quickly told the messenger, Little Li, to go and see. Before long, Wei Dameng ran back with Little Li. As soon as he entered the room, he squatted down and cried. When asked what was wrong, he sobbed and said, "If you want me to die, I'll go!" He took off his straw hat and threw it on the kang, and right at the top of the straw hat, there were two bullet holes.
    Dashui said, "Report the situation!" He said, "You told me to go, and I was determined to rush in; but before I even got to the bridge, the people on the tower shined a flashlight and shot at me, the bullet went through the straw hat! Then they fired a few more shots. I had to crawl under the embankment slope. Little Li came, and I didn't dare to go back, he told me to come back."
    Gao Tun'er was extremely anxious and shouted, "Wei Dameng! You owe me a platoon!" Wei Dameng glanced at him, sighed with a bitter face, and said, "Alas! What to do? It's easy to go in with a platoon, but it's hard to get out! And for me, it's easy to come out, but hard to go in!" (To be continued)

　　新儿女英雄传
    第十九回　大反攻
    针尖上打能能，
    刀子刃上过光景，
    铺蒺藜，
    盖葛针，
    鬼子欺压到如今！
    今天盼，
    明天盼，
    扳着指头盼，
    ……来了八路军！
    　　　——民谣
    一
    杨小梅被捕以后，不多久，中国最好的朋友——苏联—从远东出兵，跟咱们共同打日本，只几天工夫，日本就宣布投降了。消息传来，多么叫人喜欢啊！
    可是鬼子汉奸照旧盘据在我们的城市和据点里，不肯缴枪。这个县的各区主要干部，都到县上去开会。县委书记黑老蔡说，敌人不缴枪，就消灭他！咱们朱总司令已经下命令，发动全面大反攻；各路大军都出动了。咱们地方上的县大队和区小队都得调出去，改编成正规军，跟主力去打大城市。各村的民兵赶快组织民兵连，由党员和支部委员起带头作用，区长区委书记领队，统一归县委指挥，马上发动攻势，把这儿的县城拿下来。
    同志们接受了这个任务，一个个兴奋极了，都冒着大雨，连夜赶回区上去。牛大水结记着杨小梅，结记着小胖，想到要拿城，心里充满了希望。真的，抗战要胜利了，人才得全，事才得圆呀！
    回到区上，他们召集区小队一传达，队员们都欢蹦乱跳的说：“好好好，抗战快到头了。咱们拼着干吧，日本子马上就完蛋啦！”“嗨，小鬼子是露水见不得老太阳了！”“哈哈，咱们升老八路啦！快准备走吧。”
    队员们嘻嘻哈哈的忙着打背包。任务很急，谁都没顾上回家去看看；连马胆小都没有提这个岔儿。他高高兴兴的缠好子弹带，背起背包，拿上枪，笑着对旁人说：“我可是正牌的八路军啦，谁再叫我马胆小，我敲他的脑瓜儿！”牛小水全副武装，挺精神的拍着马胆小说：“这会儿你真不胆小了，往后就叫你马胆大吧。”
    这区焦区长在部队上干过，上级指定他带领区小队到县上去集合；他们每个人都背着缴获来的三八大枪，连夜出发了。
    这儿，高屯儿代理区长。大水跟他两个淋着雨，踩着泥，跑各村调集民兵。村里经过大减租大生产，农民生活改善了，抗日情绪特别高，民兵也扩大了。许多新的积极分子，象魏大猛柳喜儿这些人，还当上了民兵队长。大水高屯儿到村里，找那些队长们一传达反攻的消息，他们都喜得合不拢嘴，马上把民兵动员起来；一夜的工夫就集合了一百五十多人，组织起民兵第一连。大水高屯儿派魏大猛当一排长，柳喜儿当二排长，胡二牛当三排长。天还不明，第一连就向指定的地点出发了。
    二
    他们到了李公堤，就上船，绕到县城的西边，离城四里地的吴庄子。雨停了，日头老高，已经到了晌午时分。这里是敌占区，大水高屯儿叫船儿都隐进苇塘里，自己先上岸去探听情况。
    他俩一走到村子附近，就碰见地里有两个老乡，一个年青的正在收拾耕地的拖床，一个老头儿坐在旁边吃饭。那小伙子一瞧见他俩提着枪过来，连忙背起拖床就走。老头儿也忙立起身，慌慌张张的拾掇起家伙，也要溜。高屯儿喊：“老乡，别走呢！咱们说个话儿。”他俩假装听不见，越走得紧。
    大水高屯儿赶上去说：“别害怕！我们是八路军，跟你们打听村公所在哪儿。”老头儿和小伙子听说是八路军，都站住了，怀疑的瞅着大水他俩。老头儿吞吞吐吐的说：“我们村没有村公所。”高屯儿着急的问：“你们就没有个办公人呀？”老头儿说：“有也不在家，全下地作活了。”说着又想走。高屯儿叫住他们，耐着性子问：“你们俩干吗忙着走？”老头儿支吾说：“我们不是走，收拾完了回家歇晌去。”大水想起这村有个姓林的，过去到咱们地区，大水给他解决过问题。就提起老林，打听他住在哪儿；又解释了半天，那小伙子才展开了眉头，马上引他们找老林去。
    老林正在吃饭，一见大水他俩来了，忙立起来，很高兴的问大水：“吃过了没有？打哪儿来？”大水说：“我们想了解了解情况。”老林说：“鬼子汉奸这会儿可‘松’多啦，轻易不敢出来。”小伙子瞅着大水他俩笑开了，说：“哈，真是八路军来了，我还当是假的呢！”说罢，欢天喜地的跑出去了。
    大水问老林：“咱们有一百五十多人，在你们这儿吃一顿饭行不行？”老林笑着说：“吃几顿也行。我还在村里办公呢，更没问题啦。”
    大水高屯儿把民兵连带进村。小伙子早把消息传出去了，老百姓听说来了八路军，都围上来看。刚才在地里碰见的那个老头儿，嘻着个嘴，硬要拉大水到他家里吃饭。高屯儿笑着问：“老大伯，你不是怕我们啊？”老头儿忙说：“咳，我们不是怕八路，是怕鬼子汉奸！他们尽假装八路军哄人，给他们吓破了胆啦。咱们这地方，坏人当道，屎喀啷还螫人呢！”
    大水高屯儿派好岗哨，老林把战士们安顿在老百姓家里歇息。家家都把藏着的白面拿出来了，有的烙饼，有的赶面条。老百姓都说：“日也盼，夜也盼，好容易盼来八路军啦！”喜得战士们笑着说：“想不到敌占区的老百姓也是这么好，咱们要不卖力气干，可对不起老乡啊！”
    吃罢饭，县上来了通知：调第一连到张庄。大水他们忙坐船去了。县委的同志早在那儿等着呢。当下正式派定高屯儿为连长，牛大水为政治指导员兼副连长；又传达上级的命令，说今晚上各连都要动作起来，开始围困县城的外围据点。第一连的目标是白马村岗楼，争取楼上的伪军投降。同时，防备城里的敌人从这一个方向逃跑；口号是：“不放走一个敌人！”……交代完毕，县委的同志就走了。
    这天晚上，县城附近的岗楼，都给新组织起来的民兵连，包围的包围，控制的控制了。白马村是一个重要的地点，离城七里地，从城里到保定，水路旱路都经过这儿。这村四面都是水，只有一座大石桥通堤上的大路。大水高屯儿派魏大猛这一排，占领白马村对面堤上的民房，控制石桥，封锁岗楼的大门。又派柳喜儿这一排，顺堤到离城二里的黄庄，警戒城里的敌人，防备他们逃跑。剩下胡二牛一排人跟着连部，和大小十五只船，都留在张庄，机动使用。全连人都用白手巾扎在左胳膊上，作为暗号。规定的口令是：“反攻”。夜里，下着小雨。排长魏大猛、柳喜儿分头带着两排人，精神抖擞的出发了。
    三
    大水高屯儿昨天一夜没睡觉，白天又闹腾一天，这会儿工作布置停当，乏劲儿就上来了。高屯儿脖子上套着盒子枪，歪在炕上，张着个大嘴打呼噜。大水坐在炕头，靠着墙，一连打了好几个呵欠，眼儿又涩又疼，也困得不行了。
    外面，雨淅淅沥沥的下个不停。风从破窗户里吹进来，把小油灯吹得晃晃悠悠的。大水昏昏沉沉想起小梅娘儿俩，关在监牢里，不定怎么样了。要是这回攻下城，把她们救出来，一家子团圆了，有多高兴，有多好啊！可是转念又想：何世雄这个铁杆汉奸太狠心，也许在攻下城以前就下毒手，那就见不着啦！
    想到这儿，他心里乱腾腾的，怪搅得慌，渴睡早没影儿了。听听窗外的雨越下越大，窗户纸都打湿了。他拨亮了灯，在屋里来来回回的走。忽然想起战士们在雨地里淋着，不知道怎么样了；急忙推醒高屯儿，说：“雨下得这么大；都是些新战士，咱们去瞧瞧吧。”
    高屯儿迷迷盹盹的说：“怎么去？”大水笑着说：“怎么去！还给你套辆车吗？当然是淋着去么。掌握战士们的情绪，可就在这时候啦！”高屯儿跳下炕说：“行，走！”他带一个通讯员到石桥那儿去了。大水把连部的事儿暂时安顿给胡二牛，自己带着一个通讯员，就奔黄庄去。
    外面很黑，雨哗哗哗的下，淋得人眼都睁不开。堤上挺滑，两个人稀泥糊擦的尽摔跤。脱了鞋子光脚走，堤上有很多蒺藜、酸枣刺，怪扎的慌。通讯员小李说：“指导员，咱们不兴避避雨啊？”大水说：“别，咱俩拉着手儿走。快到了，看他们是不是在堤上警戒呢。”
    又走了一阵，对面黑暗里忽然喊：“口令！”小李说：“我们！”那边就拉枪栓，喝着说：“站住！不站住开枪打啦！”大水忙答上口令。那边说：“头里来吧。”
    他俩走过去，瞧见一个民兵淋得混身是水，戴个尖顶草帽，蹲在酸枣树底下，抱着一支大枪；见他俩来了，忙站起来说：“吓呀，指导员！怎么你们来了？”大水笑着说：“看你们来啦。这么大的雨，可淋坏了吧？”那民兵说：“哈，你还不怕淋，我们更不怕啦！”
    说话间，雨小些了。大水问：“他们都在哪儿？”民兵指着说：“就在前面。”小排长柳喜儿从堤上跑来了，问：“谁呀？”民兵说：“指导员来了。”柳喜儿说：“指导员，下这么大雨，怎么你来了？”大水说：“战士们都是才从村里调出来，一来就碰上这么大的雨，我怪结记的！”
    柳喜儿笑着说：“不碍事，大伙儿情绪高多啦，百不怎么的！”大水说：“咱们瞧瞧去。”他们走过去，民兵们都在堤坡上，背风蹲着呢；前面还有两个岗哨，是监视城里的。一伙人都站起来了，说：“好，这么大雨你们就来啦！”
    他们大部分都是共产党员。大水见他们挺有精神的守在岗位上，心里很高兴。说：“你们真不错呀！都不怕淋？”大伙儿说：“嗨，都是庄稼人，怕什么淋！”柳喜儿滑稽的说：“这才好呢，叫这雨一淋，就长得旺啦！”大伙儿都笑了。一个小民兵说：“这雨还有个好处，一张嘴就喝上水啦！”柳喜儿笑着说：“可不！雨水煎茶，天上的味儿呢。”大水心里想：“这小伙子，可象双喜咧。”他满心欢喜，对大伙儿说：“你们可注意点，别病了，完不成任务。”他们说：“病不了！常挨淋，这点雨还怕，身子骨就太娇贵啦。”
    大水叮咛的说：“咱们的岗位是很重要的。要是敌人从城里撤退，往保定跑，一定要过这儿。特别是天将明的时候，要多加小心。别在那时候睡了觉，一方面冻着生了病，一方面敌人来了受损失。这会儿雨不下了，你们别老待着。走一走，活动活动。”战士们都说：“指导员别结记，我们知道这些事儿。”
    大水他俩往回走，他们还要送。大水笑着说：“不用送，我们走啦。”

    牛大水回到连部，天还是黑糊糊的，屋里点着灯，一进门，高屯儿跳起来说：“大水，我等得你真着急！这事儿可坏了！”大水吃惊的问他什么事。高屯儿说：“魏大猛把他那一排人全拉到白马村村里去了！”大水着急说：“那不坏了？”高屯儿跺脚说：“说半天可不坏啦！”大水说：“敌人封锁住石桥，那就出不来啦！”高屯儿瞪着眼睛说：“可不就是出不来啦！”
    大水气得说不出话。高屯儿气愤愤的说：“一排人拉了进去，排长可跑回来了！”大水说：“怎么你不早说！快叫来问问吧！”通讯员马上把魏大猛叫来了。
    魏大猛淋湿的衣服贴在身上，还没干。一进来大水就问他：“一排长，我们给你的任务是什么？”魏大猛知道错了，噘着嘴说：“叫我封锁石桥么。”大水说：“那你为什么把队伍拉进去？既然拉进去，你为什么又出来？”魏大猛心里发慌，吞吞吐吐的说：“我……来报告……你不是叫围困敌人啊？大伙儿都说，在外面还能打得着敌人？倒不如跑进去，把王八窝圈起来，他没有饭吃，没有水喝，不就围困下来啦！我……我就是没想到个地形！”
    高屯儿拍着腿说：“你倒想得好！敌人要封锁了石桥，再有援兵来一堵，那十四多人在里面还不当王八？”魏大猛丧气的说：“他妈的，可不！把桥一堵就出不来啦！”高屯儿说：“你看怎么办？”魏大猛搔着头，忽然想起来说：“咱们的人不兴凫水跑啊？”高屯儿生气的说：“绕那么远还能凫过来？枪也得扔喽。还有不会水的怎么办？你闹这一手倒漂亮！”
    魏大猛不言语了，把大枪在地上一矗，蹲下去，低了头儿。大水想了一会儿，说：“大猛，赶天明以前你再突进村去，指挥那个排，受了损失你可得负责！”高屯儿挥着手说：“你马上进去，带出这个排，带不出来你就不用回来了！”大水说：“你突进去，要是天明了，就不用出来了。”魏大猛站起来，坚决的说：“我去！”他就走了。
    这儿，牛指导员跟高连长说：“往后咱们指挥可得统一喽。我叫他进去指挥，你叫他把人带出来，要是受了损失怎么办？”高屯儿明白过来了，后悔的说：“真的，这是什么时候啦，眼看天就亮了，这可怎么着？”大水说：“他还不准能突进去呢！”
    两个人正研究，窗户纸发白了。忽然听见几声枪响，高屯儿说：“坏了！打上了！”忙叫通讯员小李赶快去看看。不多会儿，魏大猛跟着小李跑回来了。他一进屋，蹲下来就哭。问他怎么了，他抽抽噎噎的说：“要是叫我死，我就去！”他把草帽摘下来，往炕上一扔，正在草帽的顶尖上，穿了两个枪窟窿眼儿。
    大水说：“你报告报告情况吧！”他说：“你们叫我去，我也下决心要突进去；可是还没走到桥跟前，楼上就亮手电打了我一枪，把草帽打透了！一连又打了几枪。我只好爬在堤坡下面。小李来了，我不敢回，是他叫我回来的。”
    高屯儿着急得不行，嚷着说：“魏大猛！你赔我一个排！”魏大猛瞅了他一眼，苦着脸儿叹气说：“唉！这事儿怎么办？一排人进去好进去，出来就出不来了！我呢，出来好出来，进去又进不去啦！”（未完）
