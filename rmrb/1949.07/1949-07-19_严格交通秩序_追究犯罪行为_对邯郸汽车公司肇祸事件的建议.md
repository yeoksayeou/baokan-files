    Strict Traffic Order
    Pursue Criminal Behavior
    Suggestions Regarding the Traffic Accident by Handan Automobile Company
    The *Jinan Daily* published on June 7th that a car from the Handan Transportation Company killed Shi Qingyun, a correspondent for the Handan County government, on April 7th. Furthermore, on May 13th, a group of over twenty people drove a car to chase and beat cart drivers in Cang County. On May 20th, due to "extremely fast driving," they hit a horse-drawn cart, and instead forcibly arrested the cart driver and took him to the company for processing. After driving several *li*, they hit and injured a farmer's ox, and without stopping, continued to speed away. West of Mazhao Village, they ran over and killed a farmer, Yang Chunrong. What kind of lawless behavior is this? This shows absolutely no demeanor of workers from the liberated areas! The company leadership turned a blind eye to such serious and continuously occurring incidents and failed to deal with them promptly, allowing disasters to happen again and again. This serious phenomenon cannot be allowed to continue. Therefore, we specifically suggest that the direct leading organs of the company take the following three measures:
    (1) Notify the company that it must conduct a thorough self-criticism, investigate and affix responsibility, and give appropriate punishments. Furthermore, use this incident to conduct extensive education among cadres and workers in all transportation departments, to make everyone vigilant and eliminate the occurrence of similar incidents.
    (2) In addition to providing appropriate compensation to the deceased, the ringleaders of the accident should be strictly dealt with according to the law after studying the specific circumstances. Furthermore, the perpetrators themselves should apologize to the family of the deceased and the farmers who suffered losses, and compensate them for their losses. The results of the handling should then be announced at the scene of the accident to restore the political influence of our Party.
    (3) Transportation authorities should work with the government to regulate road order to avoid chaos and prevent or reduce collisions between vehicles, horses, and livestock. (Le Zhou)
    Editor's Note: The serious violations of law and discipline by the Handan Transportation Company's vehicles should be thoroughly investigated and dealt with by the relevant departments as soon as possible. We also hope that the detailed process of the accident, the names of the drivers involved, and the results of the handling will be published in this newspaper.

    严格交通秩序
    追究犯罪行为
    对邯郸汽车公司肇祸事件的建议
    冀南日报六月七日登载邯市运输公司汽车，于四月七日撞死邯郸县政府通讯员史庆云；复于五月十三日聚众二十余人，驾汽车追打沧县车夫；又于五月二十日因“开驶甚急”撞上一马车，反将马车夫强行捕押至公司处理；行数里又将一农民耕牛撞伤，并不停车仍飞驰而行；至马召村西又将农民杨春荣轧死。这是何等目无法纪的行为？毫无解放区工人之气息！该公司领导上对如此严重的连续发生的事件，竟视若无睹，未加及时处理，致灾祸得以一再的发生。这种严重的现象，是不能容忍其继续发展的。为此特建议该公司直接领导机关，进行以下三点措施：
    （一）通知该公司，必须作深刻检讨，分别追究责任，给以适当的处理，并以此事件在各交通部门的干部中、工人中作广泛的教育，使大家警惕起来，消灭类似事件的发生。
    （二）除适当抚恤死者外，对肇祸的首要分子，研究具体情况，严格依法处理；并由犯法者本人向死者家属与受损失农民道歉，并赔偿其损失。再将处理结果在肇祸地点公布，以挽回我党的政治影响。
    （三）交通机关应协同政府规定公路上秩序，以免混乱，防止或减少车马、牲口撞碰。  （乐舟）
    编者按：邯郸运输公司汽车这种严重违反法纪的行为，有关方面亟应澈查究办。并望将肇祸详细经过及肇事司机姓名及处理结果，在本报公布。
