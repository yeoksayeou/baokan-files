What is Heroism?
　　A Record of a Discussion Among Senior Students at Moscow School No. 276
	Vigdalova
　　For about two weeks, a compelling notice hung at the entrance of the No. 276 Boys' School: "Prepare for a discussion, topic - 'What is Heroism?'" On the day of the scheduled meeting, the school auditorium was packed.
　　A tall young man with thick, horn-rimmed glasses said, "It's a very abstract discussion topic."
　　Another young man of medium height with lively gray eyes replied, "Not only is the topic so abstract, but it's even more difficult to discuss! At the same time, I'm not very clear what kind of discussion can be sparked when the question is so obvious?"
　　More and more people were attending. In addition to the hosts - the senior students of this school - there were also guests - female students from the No. 275 School and many graduates from the previous semester of this school who are now university students.
　　The speaker was Kima Levinson, a first-year university student. He began neither with a theoretical theme nor with abstract arguments. He started by recounting things that everyone present knew - how two female classmates, Natasha Kovshova and Masha Polivanova, sacrificed themselves by fulfilling their duties as soldiers; how Yuri Smirnov suffered extreme torture and died on the cross without saying a word to the executioners; and how the soldiers of the Young Guard endured all kinds of brutal torture without their spirit wavering in the slightest. What did they sacrifice their lives for? Why do we call them heroes?
　　The speaker himself answered this question: "Because they considered the happiness of the masses above all else, above personal happiness, and even above their own lives."
　　The speaker also emphasized the following view: advanced ideals and a progressive outlook on life are always the driving force behind heroic acts.
　　To convey all of the speaker's propositions and arguments would require a great deal of space, because he spoke in much more detail, depth, and specificity. But the idea mentioned above was the speaker's basic theme, and it immediately sparked a debate.

　　Actions Consistent with One's Conscience
　　As soon as the speaker finished, a girl's voice came from the back of the auditorium:
　　"I want to ask a question!"
　　This was Airia Boyarskaya, a female student from the No. 275 School. She walked to the podium, turned to face everyone, and said in an excited voice:
　　"Suppose the facts are like this: a platoon is about to enter battle. The first bullet kills the platoon leader. The situation is very complicated. The soldiers are panicked and ready to retreat. At this moment, I take on the responsibility of the platoon leader, shout: 'Forward!' and lead the soldiers to charge the enemy. In your opinion, can my action be called a heroic act?"
　　There was a thoughtful silence in the auditorium. Later, a cautious, childlike voice asked:
　　"Yes, we think this is a heroic act. But what do you want to say?"
　　"What I want to say is: I just wanted to get a lieutenant's epaulet, just wanted to get my higher rank. Then, from this example, it can be said: what matters is the action, the result of the action; not the feelings when completing this action."
　　Before this, everyone in the auditorium was listening attentively. But this passage immediately caused a commotion. For a moment, everyone was talking, but they quickly quieted down to listen because a tall young man stood up to speak in a corner of the auditorium. (My neighbor told me: "He is Pusulin from the ninth grade.")
　　"No, no one would call your behavior a heroic act!" the young man said indignantly, with excitement also showing on his face: "This situation means that you will only perform feats when people are watching you, but if no one saw you at this moment, if people don't think they can give you a lieutenant's epaulet, then you won't risk your life. In that case, what value does your action have?"
　　The girl was still standing on the podium. The heat of the debate shifted to the other corner of the auditorium.
　　"That's right, for example, Stakhovich in the novel 'The Young Guard'," a dark-eyed young man interrupted Pusulin, saying: "Stakhovich felt that the work of the Communist Youth League members was only about holding celebration meetings and group meetings. He could show himself off in these occasions. But when difficult days and real tests came, he couldn't stand it, and everything fell apart. Of course, he must have known how to make his reputation resound throughout the world, but when facing the executioner, he didn't persist. Why? Because the main quality in his character was vanity and ambition, and the main thought in his mind was personal gain!"
　　"However, I don't completely agree anyway!" a girl sitting not far from me said sharply: "I don't agree with the point that only actions motivated by concern for the interests of the masses can be called heroic acts. For example, a mother who wants to save her child in a hail of bullets uses her body to shield the child - isn't this a heroic act? It is a heroic act! But this action is only motivated by maternal love."
　　"Quiet, everyone," said Principal Nikolai Ivanovich Maklakov: "I am the chairman of this discussion, please pay attention to the order of the meeting. First request to speak, and then come to the podium to say what you want to say, just don't shout from your seats."
　　Immediately, a young man with fair hair, a broad forehead, and wearing a grass-green jacket stood up and said:
　　"Nikolai Ivanovich, please let me speak!"
　　"Please speak, Marayev!"
　　Marayev went to the podium. He graduated from this school last year. Now he is a university student. All the people who spoke before him spoke passionately and selflessly, without thinking about whether the impression they gave was profound. But this new speaker immediately attracted the attention of others with his thoughtful attitude, because he considered every word and every gesture of his.
　　"I think: if a person consciously walks towards death, then he is a hero, because life is the most precious thing in all of life. Therefore, I disagree with the idea expressed by the speaker just now that true heroic acts are only unique to people with advanced life outlooks. We all remember the story of Savonarola - he was a fanatical heretic, he burned many famous paintings, he smashed those exquisite statues into dust. But when people wanted him to prove the truth in his ideals, he even agreed to undergo the ordeal by fire. He was not afraid of the bonfire, nor was he afraid of the gallows, he had faith, and for his faith, he was prepared to sacrifice everything. So, isn't he a hero? Undeniably, he is a hero. Although he was a heretic who cherished his own life, he finally sacrificed it for his ideals!"

　　Actions for Advanced Ideals
　　Marayev's speech stirred up a storm. Everyone agreed: the past history is full of admirable actions and glorious names: Spartacus, Joan of Arc, the Decembrists, Sofia Perovskaya, Admiral Nakhimov, - all those epoch-making lives blew over the audience in the auditorium like a hot wind. But are all those who risk their lives worthy of being called heroes?
　　The speeches became more and more simple and concise. Sometimes the students only cited short examples to illustrate their thoughts:
　　"Dutch soldiers fighting in Indonesia are also risking their lives. According to you, is he a hero?" one person said.
　　"Once, Miloradovich had breakfast under a hail of bullets - do you regard him as a hero too?" another person asked loudly.
　　"If I haven't misunderstood you, then you think: even those who are unscrupulous and extremely shameless can perform heroic deeds. Then, as you say, those bandits who risk their lives are also heroes?"
　　A young man wearing a black tunic decorated with gold buttons - he graduated from the school this spring, and his surname is Besmertny - went to the podium.
　　"Time," he said, "is a great and fair judge, it assigns everyone their true value. Whose dim deeds of Savonarola can inspire us? It can't inspire anyone. But Giordano Bruno and Galileo, who passionately defended the truth, will always be the embodiment of heroism, perseverance, and heroic acts in our consciousness. They were truly advanced figures at the time, they defended advanced and progressive ideals. In this way, we return to the place where we started the debate, whether it is a heroic act is to be solved by looking at the truth that is defended by his ideal. The whole question is: what is he fighting for? There is no such thing as 'general' heroic acts. We should always ask ourselves: what kind of cause is this action completed for? The question cannot be asked in another way. And only actions completed for the cause of justice and progress, for the interests of the masses, can we call it a heroic act."
　　At this moment, I wanted to refute the girl who firmly believed that a mother who uses her body to protect her child in danger is a heroine. My understanding is the opposite of hers. Maternal instinct is a huge force, it can even make animals brave regardless of everything, but are those animals also heroes? I think we can very reasonably call the mother described by Leonov in "Invasion" a heroine. People tormented her son in front of her - she saw how her son suffered and didn't say a word against her conscience. Or, please remember the mother in Gorky's legend who killed her son who became a traitor. The mother of Oleg Koshevoy and the mother of Natasha Kovshova, who sent their children to the battlefield to risk death without saying a word to stop them, are also heroines. The understanding of the term "heroic act" has changed with the advancement of the times and the progress of mankind.
　　"Let me also argue in this debate!" Nikolai Ivanovich said as the young man in the black tunic just stepped down from the podium: "I would like to ask: why do you always talk about heroic acts as if you are talking about something fleeting and necessarily associated with risking your life? Can this include the entire meaning of heroic acts? For example, Chernyshevsky, isn't his life spent in desolate places, in exile, and in loneliness, isn't his constant hard work and proud faith a heroic deed?"

　　A Letter from Natasha Kovshova
　　"Please let me speak, Nikolai Ivanovich, I just wanted to talk about this!" Tenth-grader Kryuchensky stood up and said: "I think it is a pity that the speaker didn't mention daily heroic acts at all, this kind of daily heroic act sometimes requires more courage than that kind of temporary feat. I would like to give this example: the 'Electricity' factory in Leningrad did not stop working during the most difficult days of the siege. They worked, and their hands were frozen numb when they touched the metal - however, everyone was not only working, but also exceeding the standard. Isn't this a heroic act?"
　　"Of course, this is a heroic act!" My neighbor, a girl with light blue eyes and fair hair, said excitedly: "It's just that the example you cited still refers to those who work in special conditions, because the conditions of the siege require the people of Leningrad to have an extraordinary courage. If people work hard in ordinary circumstances, then in your opinion, it may not be heroic. But in fact, we often apply this term and call those who just work seriously heroes. So I think whether it is a heroic act should only be distinguished by feats and special and outstanding actions."
　　In this way, the third heated debate of this evening was triggered again. The girl's speech received a response, and many people repeatedly said that there was something special, extraordinary and obvious connected between the two concepts of feats and heroic acts. At this time, physics teacher Nikolai Ivanovich Skafransky stood up to speak.
　　"I don't want to change the beliefs of those who think that heroic acts must be brilliant and dazzling," he said: "I just want to read you a letter from Natasha Kovshova. You all know that she studied at our school, and this letter of hers was written to one of our female classmates. Please listen."
　　Nikolai Ivanovich took out a triangular envelope reminiscent of the war period. He unfolded the letter and began to read:
　　"Hello, my dear Oluska! It's been a long time since we parted. Since we parted, the world has changed a lot, and we must have experienced a lot of things. I joined the army on October 15, 1941, and arrived at the front on February 11, 1942. I have spent the cold winter and participated in many battles for the liberation of our motherland. On May 20, both my hands and legs were injured. But I am always very lucky, the injuries are not very serious, only the elbow of my left hand was pierced, and the nerves were also damaged, so, for a period of time, the fingers of my left hand could not move at all. I didn't go to the hospital, but treated it in the medical department of the company. Now I am completely healthy. My wounds have all healed, but the place where it was pierced still hurts, especially on rainy days. But I don't pay attention to this. Now I still go out 'hunting'. I have killed six more German invaders since I was injured. My girlfriend Mahing and I have recently trained a lot of young sniper soldiers. Our team is enriching day by day, and the number is increasing day by day... There are many new things in collective life, and it is impossible to write them all. How are you living now, my old friend?"
　　Nikolai Ivanovich finished reading the letter from beginning to end. The auditorium was silent. Everyone felt that Natasha herself had come to participate in the discussion, because it was extremely convincing and very powerful. Indeed, at this time, many people were thinking: if Natasha was not able to act like a hero in the difficult daily life on the front line, would she be able to complete her last heroic act?

　　…Finally, female literature teacher Kappa spoke. Her speech ended this discussion, because it was already very late.

　　"I" and "We"
　　"I think the so-called feat is the expression of a potential ability. Everything depends on how people are accustomed to dealing with the question of 'I' and 'We' anytime and anywhere to make decisions. Everything must start from the usual and ordinary small things, and never wait for accidental events. Accidental events allow you to have an opportunity to exercise yourself every day to cultivate yourself into a person who can truly persist in the face of the strictest tests when necessary. Please remember: Fadeyev listed all the names of those who could withstand the greatest torture and hardship without ever giving in, and who contributed their lives for the motherland at the end of his novel. There are nearly a hundred of them. They are all ordinary soldiers, unremarkable young men and women. In peacetime, no one would have imagined that they would have such great courage. In the past, they were just ordinary boys and girls, but they all became heroes. They were tortured, they suffered brutality, but they did not speak, they did not betray their comrades, they did not betray the noble and sacred ideals they fought for. They carried a noble and precious spirit regardless of those extraordinary pains, they disregarded themselves for the sake of the masses, in their view 'We' is higher than 'I'. Please remember a girl in the novel 'The Young Guard'. She said: 'I, of course, won't say anything, but I feel very scared.' It seems that this is 'not a heroic word', but wouldn't she be a heroine? She performed feats as naturally as breathing, she couldn't do the opposite, because the Bolshevik Party educated her and the generation of her age to act in this way. Feats themselves are always ordinary and unremarkable, but they are always produced by lofty ideals.
　　If a person puts 'We' in the most important position in his consciousness, then he will perform feats as easily as living and breathing. Heroic acts have become mass movements in our country. Our heroes are not just a few individuals, not even just hundreds. As long as you say: Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, then behind these words you can see countless heroes - the heroes we already know and those nameless heroes.
　　We have argued here about whether there have been heroes in the past. I think we can draw an accurate conclusion: yes, there have been, and freedom-loving and self-sacrificing Soviet people are precisely the successors of all the best, most noble, and most admired heroes in human history. In a country where the people are led by the Bolshevik Party and have gained freedom, the noble emotions, thoughts, and actions of mankind are developing unrestrainedly, the heroic acts produced by the Soviet regime are unprecedented, and the human qualities and feats that are equal to what we now see in our country are also something that cannot be found in the past and present.
　　Can we say that we have solved all the problems placed before us in this discussion? Of course not. But we have considered these problems - and this is the main thing. I hope you can remember. Youth is the best period in a person's life, and people are particularly sensitive and easily influenced in youth. Kalinin has told us more than once that youth is a beautiful and unrepeatable period, the beginning of all future light and happiness. It is also in a person's youth that it can be seen whether he will become a strong and useful person, and it can also be seen whether he can make the masses feel that he is valuable and they need him. I hope that after this discussion, each of you will examine your own thoughts and ask yourselves: what kind of person am I? In order to make my life live gloriously and worthily, in order to appear strong and powerful in the face of any test I encounter in my life, what kind of qualities should I acquire?"
　　(Jin Zhijun, translated from the December 25, 1947, Communist Youth League Pravda)

### 什么是英雄行为？  记莫斯科第二百七十六校高年级生的讨论会

　　什么是英雄行为？
  　记莫斯科第二百七十六校高年级生的讨论会
    维格道洛娃
    约有二星期之久在第二百七十六男校的入口处挂着一个带有号召性的通知：“请准备讨论，讨论题——‘什么是英雄行为？’”到了规定集会的那一天，学校的礼堂已是被挤得满满的了。
    有一个戴着角质镜框的大眼镜的高个子青年说：“是一个很抽象的讨论题目呢。”
    另一个中等身材，有着一对活泼的灰眼睛的青年回答他说：“不但题目如此抽象，而且是更难于讨论的呢！同时我也不很清楚，当问题如此明白的时候，能引起什么样的讨论呢？”
    参加会的人越来越多了。除了主人——本校的高年级生——外，还来了客人——第二百七十五校的女学生以及许多现在已是大学生的本校上一学期的毕业生。
    演讲的是大学一年级生基马·列文逊。他开始时既不说理论上的主题，也不说抽象的论证。他一开始就述说一些所有出席者谁都知道的事情——两个女同学娜塔莎·柯芙萧娃和玛莎·波里瓦诺娃如何尽了战士的职责而牺牲的事情；尤里·斯米尔诺夫如何受了极大的折磨，不对刽子手说一句话而死在十字架上的事情；以及青年近卫军的战士们如何受尽了非刑拷问，而他们的精神毫不稍折的事情。他们到底为了什么而牺牲自己的生命呢？为什么我们称他们为英雄呢？
    演讲者自己回答这一问题道：“因为他们认为人民大众的幸福高于一切，高于个人的幸福，也高于自己的生命。”
    演讲者还着重说明下面这一见解：先进的理想以及进步的人生观永远是英雄行为的原动力。
    要把演讲者的命题和论证全部转达出来。是非用很大的篇幅不可的，因为他更详细，更深入，更具体地说了很多。但是上面所说的那个见解就是演讲者的基本主题，而围绕着这一主题立即引起了争论。
    与自己的良心一致的行为
    演讲者的话刚一说完，就有一个少女的声音从礼堂的深处发出来：
    “我要提一个问题！”
    这是第二百七十五校的女学生爱里亚·波亚尔斯卡亚。她走到讲坛那里，转过身来面对了大家，用激动的声音说道：
    “假设事实如此，有一个班正要进入战斗。第一颗子弹就把班长打死了。情况是很复杂的。战士们慌张失措了，他们准备后退。这时我负起了班长的责任，喊道：‘向前！’就领了士兵们冲向敌人。你们看来，能不能把我的行为叫做英雄行为呢？”
    礼堂中一片沉思的静默，后来，有一个谨慎的孩子气的声音问道：
    “是，我们认为这是英雄行为。然而你想说的是什么呢？”
    “我想说的是：我只是想获得一个少尉的肩章，只是想获得我更高一级的官职。那末，由这一例子就可以说：主要的是行为，是行动的结果；而不是完成这一行为时所怀的情感。”
    在这以前，礼堂中谁都注意听着。但是这一段话立即引起了一阵骚动。一时所有的人都说话了，但是很快因为在礼堂的一个角落里有一个高个子的青年站起来说话而就都静下来听着他了。（我的一个邻座告诉我说：“他是第九年级的蒲苏林。”）
    “不，谁也不会把你的行为叫做英雄行为的！”这青年愤慨地说，在他的脸上也显露着激动的表情：“这情况的意思就是说，只有当人家看着你的时候，你才会去立功，但假如在这当儿谁也没有看见你，假如人们并不认为可以给你一个少尉的肩章，那末，你就不会去冒这生命的危险。这样说来，你的行为有什么价值呢？”
    女孩子还是站在讲坛上。争论的热潮转到了礼堂的另一角。
    “对，例如小说‘青年近卫军’中的斯大霍维支，”一个黑眼睛的青年打断了蒲苏林的话说：“斯大霍维支觉得共产主义青年团团员的工作只单单是开庆祝大会和开小组会。在这种场合他能够显示自己。但是当困难的日子和真正的考验来到的时候，他经不住了，一切都破产了。当然他也一定知道，怎么做他的荣誉可以响遍全世界，然而当面对着刽子手的时候，他竟没有坚持下去。为什么呢？就因为他性格中的主要品质是虚荣和好高鹜远，他思想中的主要思想是个人第一！”
    “然而无论如何我并不完全同意！”坐在离我不远处的一个女孩子尖声说道：“关于只有由关怀群众利益的思想所授意的行为才可以叫做英雄行为这一点，我不同意。就例如一个想在弹雨中使孩子获救的母亲用自己的身体遮住了孩子，——难道这不是英雄行为？是英雄行为！但这行为只是由母亲的爱所授意的。”
    “静一静，”校长尼古拉·依万诺维支·马克拉柯夫说：“我是这讨论会的主席，请你们注意会场秩序。先要求发言，然后走到讲坛上来把所要说的话都说出来，只是不要在座位上乱嚷一阵。”
    马上就有一个头发淡黄，前额宽阔，穿着草绿色上衣的青年站起来说：
    “尼古拉·依万诺维支，请让我发言！”
    “请说吧，马拉也夫！”
    马拉也夫站到讲坛上去了。他是在去年从这学校毕业的。现在他是大学生。所有在他以前发言的人都热烈而忘我地说着话，并不想到他们所给人的印象是否深刻。但是这一个新的发言者马上因他那深思熟虑的态度而引起了旁人的注意，因为他思量着自己的每一句话，每一个手势。
    “我认为：假使一个人自觉地向死亡走去，那末，他就是英雄，因为生命是人生所有的东西中最宝贵的一件东西。因此在关于真正的英雄行为只是为有着先进的人生观的人所特有这一点上，我是不同意刚才演讲者所发表的思想的。我们都记得萨沃纳劳拉的事——他是个疯狂的异教徒，他曾把许多名画付之一炬，他曾把那些精美的雕像碎为尘土。但是当人们要他证明他那理想中的真理时，他甚至同意去经受火的考验。他既不怕篝火，也不怕绞架，他是有着信仰的，而且为了自己的信仰，他准备牺牲一切。这样，难道他不是英雄吗？毋庸争论的，他是英雄。虽然他是一个宝贵着自己生命的异教徒，但终于为了自己的理想而牺牲了它！”
    为了先进理想的行为
    马拉也夫的发言象掀起了一场暴风雨一样。所有的人都同意：在过去的历史上充满着受人赞美的行为和光荣的名字：斯拜尔达克，尚娜·特阿尔克，十二月党人，苏菲亚·彼洛芙斯卡亚，海军大将纳希莫夫，——所有那些划时代的生命象一阵热风似的在礼堂的听众头上吹过。但是否所有冒着自己生命的危险的人都值得称为英雄呢？
    发言变得越来越简单紧凑了。有时同学们只举出一些简短的例子来说明自己的思想：
    “在印度尼西亚作战的荷兰士兵也冒着自己生命的危险。依你说来，难道他是一个英雄？”有一个人说。
    “有一次米洛拉道维支在弹雨下用早餐，——难道你也把他当作英雄来看？”另一个人高声反问。
    “假使我没有误解你，那末你认为：即使是毫无原则而又极无耻的那种人都可能立下英雄的功劳。那末，如你所说，那些冒着自己生命危险的匪徒也是英雄了？”
    有一个穿装饰着金色纽扣的黑色短上衣的青年——他是今年春天由学校毕业的，他姓倍斯美尔耐衣，——站到了讲坛上去。
    “时间，”他说，“是一个伟大而公正的审判官，它给每一个人评定出他真正的价值来。那个萨沃纳洛拉的黯淡的功劳能在我们中间鼓舞谁呢？鼓舞不了谁。而热情地护卫了真理的曹尔达诺·布鲁诺和伽理略在我们的意识中将永远是英勇，坚韧和英雄行为的化身。他们实在是当时先进的人物，他们护卫了先进和进步的理想。这样，我们重又回返到开始争论的地方来了，是否是英雄行为这一问题是要看由他那理想所护卫着的真理来解决的。所有的问题在于：他是为着什么而去斗争的。‘一般的’英雄行为是没有的。我们应该常常扪心自问：这一行为是为了什么样的事业而完成的？问题不可能有旁的问法。而只有为了正义和进步的事业，为了人民大众的利益而完成的行为，我们才能把它叫做英雄行为。”
    这时，我想反驳那个深信着在危险中用自己的身体来保护孩子的母亲是一个女英雄的少女。我的认识与她相反。母亲的本能是一种巨大的力量，它甚至也能使动物不顾一切地变得勇敢起来，但是难道那些动物也都是英雄吗？我觉得我们能够很合理地把列昂诺夫在“侵略”中所描写的母亲称为女英雄。人们当着她的面来折磨她的儿子——她看到儿子遭受着怎样的痛苦而不说一句违背自己良心的话。或者，请记忆一下高尔基在他的传说中所描写的那个杀死她那当了叛徒的儿子的母亲。那送自己的孩子上战场，去冒死亡的危险而不说一句扯腿的话的奥列格·柯谢畏依的母亲和娜塔莎·柯芙萧瓦的母亲也都是女英雄。对于“英雄行为”这一名词的理解是随着年代的前进和人类的进步而有所改变的。
    “也让我在这争论中辩论一下！”当那个穿黑上衣的青年刚一走下讲坛的时候，尼古拉·依万诺维支就说：“我想请问一下：为什么你们在说到英雄行为的时候，总象在说一种稍纵即逝而对生命的冒险又必需相提并论的事情呢？难道这样说能包括英雄行为的全部意义吗？譬如说车尔尼雪夫斯基，难道他那在荒僻之地，在放逐中和在孤独中所渡过的生活，难道他那不断的辛劳和高傲的信仰不是英雄的功劳吗？”
    娜塔莎·柯芙萧娃的一封信
    “请让我发言，尼古拉·依万诺维支，关于这一点我正想要说话！”第十年级生克留强斯基站起来说：“我觉得很遗憾，演讲者竟一点也没有提起日常的英雄行为，这种日常的英雄行为有时比那种一时的功劳是需要更大的勇气的。我想举这末一个例：列宁格勒的‘电力’工厂在对封锁最艰难的日子中也没有停工。他们工作着，而他们的手在触到金属时冻得麻木了，——然而，所有的人不单是工作着，而且还超过了标准。难道这还不是英雄行为？”
    “当然，这是英雄行为！”我的邻座，一个眼睛浅蓝，头发淡黄的女孩子激动地说：“只是你所举的例子还是说到那些在特殊条件下工作的人，因为是封锁的条件要求列宁格勒人要有一种非凡的勇气。假如人们在普通的情况下好好工作，那末在你看来或者就不是英雄。但事实上我们却是常常应用这个名词而把那些就只是认真地工作的人叫做英雄的。所以我认为是否是英雄行为是只应该用功劳和特殊而杰出的行为来区别的。”
    这样，又引起了这一晚上第三次的热烈争论。女孩子的发言得到了反应，很多人都再三重复地说在功劳和英雄行为这两个概念之间是有着某种特殊的，非凡而又明显的东西联系着的。这时，物理教员尼古拉·依万诺维支·斯卡夫郎斯基站起来发言了。
    “我不想使那些认为英雄行为一定是辉煌灿烂的人来改变他们的信念”。他说：“我只是想给你们念一念娜塔莎·柯芙萧娃的一封信。你们都知道她在我们学校里念过书，她的这封信就是写给我们的一个女同学的。请听吧。”
    尼古拉·依万诺维支拿出了一个使人联想到战争时期的可纪念的三角形信封。他展开这信开始念道：
    “你好，我的亲爱的奥柳斯加！我们分别以来已经很久了。从我们分别到现在，沧海桑田，世事已经改变不少了，我们也都必然地经历了很多事情。我在一九四一年十月十五日参加了军队，在一九四二年二月十一日到了前方。渡过了严寒的冬天，也为了我们祖国的解放而参加过很多战斗。五月二十日我的两手和两腿都负伤了。但我永远是很幸运的，负的伤都不很严重，只是左手的肘节上面被打穿了，神经也被打坏了，因此，在先一个时期左手的手指完全不能动弹。我没有到医院里去，就在连队的医疗处医治。现在已经完全健康了。我的伤口都长上了，只是在打穿的地方还发痛，特别是雨天。但是我并不注意到这一点。现在我仍出去‘狩猎’。在我负伤以后已经又打死六个德寇了。我和我的女朋友玛兴加在最近训练出了不少青年狙击兵。我们的队伍在一天天地充实起来，人数在一天天地增多起来……在集体生活中新鲜的事情很多，也无法都写出来。你现在生活得怎样，我的老朋友？”
    尼古拉·依万诺维支把这信从头至尾念完了。礼堂中寂静无声。所有的人都觉得娜塔莎本人也来参加讨论了，因为这是极使人信服而又是很有力量的话。的确，这时很多人都在想：假使在平时，在前方艰苦的日常生活中，娜塔莎要不能够象英雄一样地行动，难道她能完成自己最后一次的英雄行为吗？
    ……最后，由文学女教员卡琶说话。她的说话结束了这一次讨论会，因为时间已经很晚了。
    “我”和“我们”
    “我认为所谓功劳就是一种潜在能力的表现。一切都是要看人们怎样习惯于随时随地去处理‘我’和‘我们’这一问题而来作决定。一切都要由平时及平常的小事着手做起，而决不要等待偶然的事件。偶然的事件允许天天给你们一个锻炼自己的机会来把自己培养成为一个在必要时真正能在最严格的考验面前坚持下去的人。请记住：法捷耶夫在他小说的末尾列举了所有那些能经受住最大的折磨和苦刑而决不屈服，为了祖国而把自己的生命贡献出来的人的姓名。他们将近有一百个人。他们都是普通的士兵，并不特出的青年和少女。在和平时期谁也不会设想他们会有如此巨大的魄力。过去他们都只是些普通的男孩子和女孩子，而竟然都成了英雄。他们遭受了折磨，他们遭受了非刑，但是他们不作声，他们并没有出卖同伴，并没有出卖他们所争取的崇高而神圣的理想。他们带着一种高尚可贵的精神而不顾那些非常的痛苦，他们为了大众而不顾自己，在他们看来‘我们’高于‘我’。请记住小说‘青年近卫军’中的一个少女。她说：‘我，当然，是什么也不会说的，然而我觉得很怕。’似乎，这‘不是英雄的话’，但是难道她会不是一个女英雄吗？她象呼吸一样平常地立下了功劳，他不可能做出相反的结果来，因为布尔什维克党是教育了她以及和她同等年龄的一代如此行动的。功劳本身总是平常而不出奇的，但它总是由崇高的理想所产生的。
    假使一个人把‘我们’放在自己意识中最主要的地位，那末，他就会象活着呼吸一样容易地去立功。英雄行为在我们的国家内已经成为群众性的了。我们的英雄不只是个别的几个，甚至也不只是几百个。只要一说：列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、塞瓦斯托波尔，那末，在这些字的后面你们就可以看到无数的英雄——我们已经知道的英雄以及那些无名的英雄。
    我们曾在这里争论过是不是在过去也曾有过英雄这一问题。我觉得我们可以得出一个准确无误的结论来了：是，有过，热爱自由而又富于自我牺牲精神的苏联人正就是人类历史上所有最优秀，最崇高以及最受人赞美的那些英雄的继承者。在人民由布尔什维克党所领导而已经获得了自由的国家内，人类的崇高的情感，思想和行为是不受拘束地发展着的，由苏维埃政权所产生的英雄行为是史无前例的，而相等于我们现在在我们的国家内所见的人类的品质和功劳，也是过去和现在所找不出来的。
    能不能说我们在这一讨论会上把所有放在我们面前的问题都解决了呢？当然，不能。然而我们已经把这些问题都加以考虑了——而这正是主要的。我希望你们能记住。青年时期是一个人一生中最好的一个时期，人在青年时期也特别敏感而易于感化。加里宁曾不止一次地告诉我们，青春是一个美好而又是一去不可再得的时期，是将来一切光明和幸福的开端。也就是在一个人的青年时期可以看出他是否将成为一个坚强有用的人，也可以看出他是否能使群众觉得他可贵而需要他。我希望在这个讨论会后，你们每一个人都来检查一下自己的思想并且扪心自问：我到底是一个什么样的人？为了要使我的生命活得光荣而又有价值，为了要使我在生命途中所遇到的任何考验的面前显得坚强有力，我应该使自己获得一种什么样的品质？”
