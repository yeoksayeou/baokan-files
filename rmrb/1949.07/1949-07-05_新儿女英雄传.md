Episode 17: The Fish Escapes the Net
(Continued 1)

The attack hadn't started yet. On the enemy's two guard towers, two sharpshooters used two Type 38 rifles to block an east-west street. Several civilians tried to escape, and they were shot down one by one. Our troops were very angry when they saw this, and immediately four sharpshooters went to the roof of Ma's butcher shop, diagonally opposite the guard towers, using sandbag fortifications as cover, aiming at the gun holes. It was just around sunset when the first shot took down the sharpshooter on the east guard tower.

Hearing the sharpshooter on the west guard tower shout, "Damn it, you're shooting like chickens! If you've got the guts, try me!" DaShui recognized Zhang Jinlong's voice and was furious. Then he heard one of our sharpshooters angrily shout, "Don't curse, let's have a contest!" Zhang Jinlong on the other side said, "Come on! Let's see who the real hero is. I'll put up a brick, and if you hit it, I'll drop my gun." The sharpshooter on our side said, "Okay, I'll put up a brick too, and if you hit it, I'll drop my gun."

After speaking, he put a brick on top of the sandbags. With a "bang," the brick on our side was shot down. Zhang Jinlong proudly shouted, "How's my aim? Now it's your turn!" As he was placing a brick on the parapet of the guard tower, there was a gunshot, and his hand was pierced. Zhang Jinlong was heard cursing, "You motherfucking ×! You shot my hand, you're no hero!" Niu DaShui angrily shouted, "Zhang Jinlong! You're acting like a bear, pretending to be human. You're no kind of hero!"

It got dark. The headquarters issued an order: we must take down these two big guard towers tonight. In an instant, machine guns, rifles, and grenade launchers on many rooftops began firing. The guard towers also fired back. The area around one of the gun holes in the guard towers was riddled with small holes, and people kept falling inside. But He ShiXiong gritted his teeth and refused to surrender.

Guo SanMazi, seeing that they couldn't hold on, went to the Western-style house in the Catholic Church to discuss with He ShiXiong. The two had a secret conversation for a while, and then issued an order, saying that a telegram had arrived from the city, saying that as long as they held out until dawn, reinforcements would arrive; anyone who didn't fight hard would be executed on the spot! The battle continued fiercely.

Our headquarters sent a part of the troops to dig holes in the walls opposite the guard towers, and also brought in large water pumps from the fire brigade, filling them with two large buckets of gasoline; the pumps sucked up the gasoline and sprayed it onto the guard towers, with grenade launchers providing cover. As soon as they were hit, the fire started. The west guard tower started burning first, the flames reaching straight into the sky. The enemy, fearing that we would charge, set fire to the civilian houses next to the guard tower and behind the Catholic Church, lighting up the surroundings. The east guard tower also caught fire.

At this time, black clouds surged over from the northwest, bringing wind, rain, and large hailstones; the headquarters ordered a temporary ceasefire. The soldiers, soaked in the rain, went inside the houses.

DaShui and the pistol team couldn't wait to capture He ShiXiong, Zhang Jinlong, and the others. They held a small meeting and estimated that there weren't many enemies left alive, so they planned to find a place to sneak in. With a dozen or so pistols, the enemies wouldn't be able to escape. DaShui contacted the headquarters, and the headquarters happened to be sending a platoon to search, so they were asked to go together.

The rain was still falling heavily. The group got a ladder and climbed over the wall from the northeast corner. When they reached the second back door of the Catholic Church, there was no movement at all. They wondered if there were bunkers. Sneaking into the front yard of the Catholic Church, DaShui tripped over something; he felt around and found it was a machine gun.

Entering the Western-style house of the Catholic Church, some turned on flashlights, others lit toothbrush handles, and shone them around. He ShiXiong's room was empty, without a single person. The large ammunition bags hanging on the wall were empty of bullets, and the pistol holsters were also empty. There was a large pile of burned paper ashes on the ground. Things were in a mess in every room; not a single person was to be seen. The comrades were both angry and hateful, gritting their teeth and saying, "Damn it, they must have run away!"

Seven

He ShiXiong, Guo SanMazi, and Zhang Jinlong, with twenty-odd men, had long been preparing to escape. When the hailstorm started, they took the opportunity to dig holes in the wall, crawl out, wade through the lotus root pond, and Zhang Jinlong went barefoot up the city wall, using ropes to pull them up one by one. Then, slowly lowering the ropes, they slid down one by one. The group cautiously made their way to the riverbank. On the opposite bank of the river, Gao Tun'er had been ordered by the headquarters to send a part of his team to guard, preventing scattered enemies from escaping.

He ShiXiong saw a group of figures in the darkness, holding guns; he quickly took off his belt, and while beating his concubine, cursed, "Damn it, you traitorous wife! Why aren't you leaving after being caught?" Team member Ma Danxiao cocked his rifle and shouted, "Password!" He ShiXiong said, "What the hell is the password! We're from the sub-district headquarters, we caught He ShiXiong's concubine, we're all soaked and freezing, why don't you get a boat to ferry us over!"

Ma Danxiao and the others really thought they were from the headquarters, and immediately three boats went over. He ShiXiong pulled his concubine, cursing, "You stinking woman, still clinging on and not leaving?" He pushed her down into the boat. The group got on the boat and rowed over.

The team member on He ShiXiong's boat was a young boy. He ShiXiong said with a smile, "Let me see if your gun is any good." He casually took the gun, weighed it, and said, "Tsk, can you even use a gun like this!" He pulled the bolt and threw it into the water. The young boy anxiously said, "Why did you throw my bolt away?" He ShiXiong said with a condescending laugh, "Why do you need a broken gun like this? We've got plenty of good guns that we've captured, I'll get you a new one later."

The boat reached this side, and the group all got onto the embankment. He ShiXiong said, "We're going to Xiao Li Village, can you guide us!" They led our four team members away. The puppet soldiers behind saw a shack on the embankment and crawled into it to grab quilts. They even stripped the cotton clothes off the local villagers. The villagers felt that something was wrong, and secretly tugged at team member Wang Quan'er, whispering, "These don't seem like our people! What kind of Eighth Route Army is like that?"

Wang Quan'er hurriedly rushed forward, grabbed a straggling puppet soldier, blocked his chest with his bayonet, and quietly said, "Don't shout! Who exactly are you?" That person said, "I'll give you the rifle, He ShiXiong has already passed ahead." Wang Quan'er was extremely anxious when he heard this. There was only him left here, he didn't dare to chase, so he had to ask the villagers to watch the prisoner, and he himself, carrying the rifle, ran back to report the news.

Niu DaShui, leading the pistol team, came out of the Catholic Church, angrily running to find Gao Tun'er, asking, "He ShiXiong has escaped. Have you seen him here?" Gao Tun'er and the others were guarding the bridge, anxiously saying, "We've been guarding straight here, we haven't seen him go past!" Just as they were talking, Wang Quan'er ran over to report: He ShiXiong and his gang escaped from the embankment, and they also captured our four team members. DaShui and Gao Tun'er hurriedly gathered people, found three boats, and thirty-odd people, and went after them together. The local villagers who were rowing the boats, hearing that He ShiXiong had escaped, desperately rowed, the boats speeding along the embankment.

Ma Danxiao and those people were walking on the embankment, feeling that the direction was wrong, and the more they walked, the more suspicious he became. Turning his head, he discovered that someone behind him was pointing a gun at him. He thought, "Damn it! It must be the traitorous army. Damn it! How could we be so muddled, even ferrying them over in a boat? We're all blind!" Thinking of this, he felt so bad that he almost cried.

He walked forward blankly, thinking in his heart, "We can't let them go! I have to think of a trick..." After thinking for a long time, he stopped and said, "There are landmines ahead, we can't go on!" They said, "If there are landmines, you go ahead!" A traitor forced him to walk in front. Ma Danxiao deliberately pretended to be dodging landmines, walking slowly and crookedly, hoping that our people would catch up.

The young boy recognized Guo SanMazi and Zhang Jinlong among those people, and he also understood what was going on. He was extremely anxious. He thought, "The fat guy behind must be He ShiXiong, and he's taken my gun, what should I do?" He was so nervous that he was sweating cold, thinking that he still had two hand grenades on him, it would be better to fight with this big traitor, even if he died, it would be worth it. Thinking this, he felt both afraid and panicked, and his legs began to tremble.

He ShiXiong shouted, "Damn it, you little bastard, why aren't you walking faster!" The young boy gritted his teeth, mustered up a burst of courage, and secretly took the hand grenade in his hand. He ShiXiong shouted, "What are you doing?" The young boy panicked for a moment, forgot to pull the pin, turned around and grabbed He ShiXiong's collar, raised the hand grenade and smashed it down. But He ShiXiong dodged, and shot him in the head, and the young boy fell onto the embankment slope. (To be continued)

　　新儿女英雄传
    孔厥　袁静
    第十七回　鱼儿漏网了
    （续一）
    攻击还没有开始。敌人的两个岗楼上，两个特等射手用两支三八大枪，封锁了一条东西大街。有几个老百姓逃跑，一枪一个，都给打死了。咱们的队伍看着很生气，马上有四个神枪手，上了岗楼斜对面马家肉铺的房上，麻袋工事掩护，瞄准岗楼上那个枪眼儿。这正是刚没太阳的时候，头一枪就把东边岗楼上的特等射手撂倒了。
    听见西边岗楼上的特等射手喊：“他妈的，你们打的鸡巴枪！有本事跟老子试试！”大水听出来是张金龙的声音，心里气得慌。又听见咱们的一个神枪手气愤愤的喊：“你别骂街，咱们比比看！”那边张金龙说：“来！看看谁是英雄好汉。我立一个砖，你要打中了，我的枪就撂下。”这边的神枪手说：“行，我也立一个砖，你要打中了，我也撂下枪。”
    说完，他就在麻袋上面立了个砖，那边叭的一枪，就把这边的砖打下了。张金龙骄傲的喊：“看我的准头怎么样？这回瞧你的吧！”说着他拿一块砖立在岗楼的垛口上，刚一放就一声枪响，连他的手都打穿了。听得见张金龙骂：“你妈的臭×！你打老子的手，你不算好汉！”牛大水愤恨的喊：“张金龙！你狗熊耍把戏，混充人形儿呢。你是屁个英雄好汉！”
    天黑了。司令部下命令：今晚上一定要打下这两个大岗楼。刹时间，好些个房顶上，机枪步枪掷弹筒一齐射击开了。岗楼上也朝这边打。岗楼的一个枪眼四周，密密麻麻的打了许多小窟窿，枪眼里不断倒下人。可是何世雄咬着牙，不叫投降。
    郭三麻子眼看顶不住了，到天主堂的洋房里，跟何世雄商量。两个人密谈了一阵，又传下命令，说城里来了电报，只要支持到天明，救兵就可以来了；谁要作战不力，就地枪决！战斗又激烈的继续下去。
    咱们司令部派一部分队伍，在岗楼对面的墙上掏了窟窿，又从救火会找来大唧筒，弄了两大桶汽油；唧筒吸饱汽油，喷射到岗楼上去，掷弹筒配合着打。一打过去，火就着了。西边的岗楼先烧起来，火焰直冲到天上。敌人怕我们冲锋，把岗楼旁边和天主堂后面的民房都点着了，四下里照得通亮。东边的岗楼也着火了。
    这时候西北角上黑云涌过来，又是风，又是雨，夹着挺大的雹子；司令部下命令停会儿再打。战士们淋着雨，都进了屋里。
    大水和手枪组一伙，恨不得一下把何世雄张金龙这些人捉住。他们开了个小会，估计敌人活着的不多了，打算找个地方摸进去，有这么十几支手枪，敌人就跑不了。大水跟司令部接头，司令部刚好派一个排要去搜，就叫他们一块儿去。
    雨还唰唰唰的下着，一伙人弄了个梯子，从东北角翻墙进去；到了天主堂的第二道后门，一点动静也没有。他们想，是不是有地堡呢？摸进天主堂的前院，大水一下给个什么绊倒了；一摸，是个机枪身。
    进了天主堂的洋房子，有的打亮手电，有的点着牙刷把子，四下里照。那何世雄的屋里，空洞洞的，没有一个人。墙上挂的大转袋，里面没有一颗子弹，手枪套子也是空的。地上有一大堆烧了的纸灰。哪一个屋里东西都乱七八糟；没有一个人影儿。同志们又是气，又是恨，咬牙说：“他妈的，准跑了！”
    七
    何世雄郭三麻子张金龙，带了二十多人，早就准备要逃跑，一下雹子，他们趁这机会，挖墙窟窿钻出来，趟水过了荷叶坑，张金龙光脚上了城墙，用绳子把他们一个个拉上去。又慢慢儿吊着绳子，一个个滑溜下去。一伙人探头探脑的摸到河边。河对岸，高屯儿早奉了司令部的命令，派了一部分队员，正把守着，防备零星的敌人逃跑。
    何世雄在黑暗里望见一伙人影，拿着枪；忙解下皮带，一面打他的小婆，一面骂：“他妈的，你这个汉奸老婆！抓住了还不走？”队员马胆小拉着枪栓喝问：“口令！”何世雄说：“什么他妈的口令！我们是分区司令部的，抓住了何世雄的小婆，我们全淋湿了，挺冷，还不拿船摆过我们！”
    马胆小他们真以为是司令部的，马上过去三只船。何世雄拉着小婆，骂：“你这臭娘们，还死赖着不走啊？”一推就把她推倒在船里。一伙人上了船，划过来。
    何世雄船上的队员是小小子。何世雄笑着说：“我看你的枪好不好。”随手拿过枪来，掂了掂，说：“咳，这样的枪还能使唤！”拉下枪栓就扔到水里了。小小子着急说：“你怎么把我的枪栓扔了？”何世雄吓吓的笑着说：“要这样的破枪干吗？咱们缴下来的好枪多着呐，回头给你换一支。”
    船摆到这边，一伙人都上了堤。何世雄说：“我们到小李庄，你们给引个路！”他们带着咱们的四个队员就走。后边的伪军，瞧见堤上有个窝铺，就钻到窝棚里抢被子。还把里面老乡的棉衣扒了。老乡心里觉得不对劲，暗暗拉拉队员王圈儿，小声说：“这可不象咱们的人啊！那有这样的八路军？”
    王圈儿忙抢上去，把掉队的一个伪军抓住，用抉枪堵住他的胸口，悄悄说：“别喊！你们到底干什么的？”那人说：“我把大枪给了你吧，头里何世雄过去了。”王圈儿一听，急得不成，这儿只剩他一个了，他不敢去追，只好叫老乡们看着俘虏，自己提着大枪，飞奔回去报信。
    牛大水带着手枪组，出了天主党，气呼呼的跑来找高屯儿，问：“何世雄逃走了。这儿见了没有？”高屯儿他们正在守桥，着急的说：“我们直直的守在这儿，就没见过去么！”正说着，王圈儿跑来报告：何世雄一伙从堤上逃跑了，还抓去了咱们四个队员。大水高屯儿急忙集合人，找了三只船，三十多人，一齐去追。划船的老乡们听说何世雄逃跑，拼命的打棹，船儿沿着堤直窜。
    八
    马胆小跟那些人在堤上走，觉得方向不对，越走心里越疑惑。一回头，发现背后有人拿枪指着他。他想：“坏了！不用说就是汉奸队。妈的！怎么我们就这么糊涂，还用船摆过他们来？我们都瞎了眼啦！”想到这儿，他难受得差点儿哭下了。
    他呆呆的往前走，心里面盘算：“可不能放走他们！我得想个招儿……”寻思半天，就站住说：“前面尽地雷，不能走了！”他们说：“有地雷你头里走！”一个汉奸逼着他，走在头里。马胆小故意装着躲地雷，曲曲弯弯的走得很慢，一心盼望咱们的人追上来。
    小小子从这些人里面，认出来有郭三麻子张金龙，心里也明白了，非常着急。他想：“身后面那胖子准是何世雄，枪又给他拿去了，怎么办？”他急得浑身出冷汗，想着身上还有两颗手榴弹，不如跟这大汉奸拼了，自己死也值得。这么想着，他又害怕，又惊慌，腿就抖起来。
    何世雄喝着说：“他妈的，你这个兔崽子，还不快走！”小小子咬一咬牙，蹩出一股子横劲儿，偷偷把手榴弹拿在手里。何世雄喝一声：“干什么？”小小子一时慌张，忘了拉线，转身一把抓住何世雄的领子，举起手榴弹就砸。可是何世雄一闪身，一枪打在他脑瓜儿上，小小子就栽到堤坡上了。（未完）
