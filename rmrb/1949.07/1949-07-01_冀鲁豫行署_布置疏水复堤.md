Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office

Deploys Drainage and Embankment Restoration

[Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] After the Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office deployed drainage and embankment restoration work throughout the region this spring, various localities universally completed the preparatory work before construction, such as surveying, designing, and reviewing. Many places began work before the wheat harvest. According to statistics: (1) Sixty drainage ditches have been dug, with approximately 180,000 meters in length and 711,000 cubic meters of earthwork; this can prevent 200,1720 mu of land from being affected by floods. (2) A total of 78,904 meters of river have been dug. Now, the Administrative Office has issued instructions to various special districts and counties to ensure the completion of drainage projects before the rainy season after the wheat harvest. It is estimated that they will generally be able to complete the work on time.

  　布置疏水复堤
    【冀鲁豫电】今春冀鲁豫行署布置了全区疏水复堤工作后，各地普遍做好了测量、设计、审核等施工前的准备工作。许多地方麦前已开始动工，据统计：（一）已挖排水沟六十条，长约十八万公尺的土方七十一万一千公尺；可使二十万零一千七百二十亩地免遭水患。（二）挖河共长七万八千九百四公尺。现在行署又向各专、县发出指示，保证在麦后雨季前完成疏水工程。估计一般能按时完成。
