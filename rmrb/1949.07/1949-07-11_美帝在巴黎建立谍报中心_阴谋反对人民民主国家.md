　　美帝在巴黎建立谍报中心
  　阴谋反对人民民主国家
    【新华社北平十日电】塔斯社海牙七日讯：据此间真理报报道，美国在巴黎组织欧洲经济谍报中心，该报称：早在五月中，即已获悉华盛顿在中央谍报处的提议下，决定在巴黎以“情报处”的名义设立一特别经济谍报机关。根据最近的材料，这一机关的任务是系统地搜集与整理关于马歇尔计划国家、北大西洋公约签约国及人民民主国家的所有情报。美国在各国的各种代表，如外交、经济、军事、文化、宗教及其他各种代表团，都必需经常地把秘密情报供给在巴黎的“情报处”。巴黎的情报处必须特别注意收集关于英国打入马歇尔计划国家及北大西洋公约国家情形的材料。“情报处”的主要任务之一，是指挥对英国的特别间谍活动；并经常注意英国在上述国家内的活动。“情报处”更有一项任务，就是计拟反对人民民主国家的各种办法。此一秘密经济谍报机关将同时进行宣传马歇尔计划及大西洋公约的工作。预料声名狼藉的波仑，将为这间谍组织的首脑。
