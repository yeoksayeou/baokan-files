　　Xiahebao Mine Fire Incident
  　Lack of Prevention Beforehand, No Investigation Afterwards
    North China People's Government Approves Punishment for Mine Manager
    [This Newspaper Reports] The materials warehouse of the Xiahebao Coal Mine, which belongs to the Lu'an Coal Mine of the Baijin Coal Industry Company, caught fire at 11:00 PM on August 29th of last year, burning down five warehouse sheds, over 400,000 jin of large and small mountain timbers (used to shore up mine tunnels, supported by pillars to prevent mine collapses), as well as coal pillars and wooden planks. Calculated at the market price at the time, the total loss amounted to 3,553,263 Jibi currency. The warehouse has always been poorly managed, lacking guards, allowing anyone to enter and exit, and the order was chaotic, with no inspections conducted. After the incident occurred, the mine not only failed to investigate and review the cause of the fire or hold anyone responsible but instead attributed it to sabotage by bad elements and ignored it. In order to clarify the truth, the Public Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government set a deadline for the mine to investigate and report. However, the mine manager continued to show an irresponsible and disobedient attitude, delaying the report for a long time without providing any explanation. In order to enforce responsibility and correct this anarchic and undisciplined phenomenon, the Enterprise Department, in addition to ordering the mine to continue investigating the cause of the fire and inspect and improve the current storage and management of warehouse materials, has also submitted to and been approved by the North China People's Government to give the mine manager Li Fengchun and deputy manager Wang Zimin each a demerit. Furthermore, the North China People's Government also ordered the Baijin Coal Industry Company's Lu'an Coal Mine to conduct a self-criticism and report it for failing to effectively supervise and inspect the Xiahebao Mine, help it investigate and handle the matter promptly, and for long-term shelving, laxity, and delay.

　　小河堡矿厂失火事件
  　事前不防事后不查
    华北人民政府批准处分该矿经理
    【本报讯】白晋煤业公司潞安煤矿所属小河堡煤矿之材料厂棚，曾于去年八月二十九日夜十一时失火，烧毁厂棚五间，大小山条（用以棚坑道，下支以柱，借防矿道坍陷）四十余万斤及煤柱、木板等物，按当时市价计算，共损失冀钞三百五十五万三千二百六十三元。该厂棚素即保管不严，缺少警卫，任人出入，秩序混乱，不做检查。事件发生后，该矿不但不调查检讨失火原因，不追究责任，反而诿之为坏分子破坏，置诸不理。华北人民政府公营企业部为明确真象，曾限期该矿查明具报，该矿经理仍表现不负责与不听从指示的态度，长期拖延不报，又不说明原因。企业部为严明责任，纠正此种无政府无纪律现象，除责成该矿继续追查失火原因，及检查与改善现在仓库材料存放保管情形外，并经呈准华北人民政府，给予该矿经理李逢春、副经理王滋民各记大过一次处分。又白晋煤业公司潞安煤矿在领导上未能切实督促检查，帮助该矿及早查明处理，长期搁置，松懈拖延，华北人民政府亦责令自作检讨具报。
