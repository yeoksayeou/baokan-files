　　Transforming Wartime Industry into Peacetime Industry
  　Beiping General Machinery Factory Established
    [Reported by this newspaper] To meet the needs of current production and construction, and to transform wartime industry into peacetime construction industry, thereby strengthening unified leadership and planned production, the Beiping General Machinery Factory of the North China Machinery Manufacturing Company and its three affiliated branch factories were officially established yesterday (June 30th) after many days of active preparation. Simultaneously, the Guo Zhi Wu Guan Hui (an organization managing public and private manufacturing and repair of military equipment) was also announced to be terminated. Private repair shops, with the exception of two larger ones that may postpone their conversion until after July, must all complete their conversion by the end of June. The factory was formerly the Beiping First Machinery Factory and the First, Third and several other repair shops, with an original workforce of more than 1,400 people. Its main task was to manufacture and repair military equipment. Because this type of production no longer meets current needs, its conversion had been planned for some time and it had already partially engaged in the production of machines for peacetime construction. After adjusting its structure and determining its personnel establishment, the factory was formally established as its current production organization. The task of the General Factory, under the leadership of the North China Machinery Manufacturing Company, is to lead and manage the production of the General Factory and its branch factories, and it has no external operating tasks.

　　转战时工业为和平工业
  　北平机器总厂成
    【本报讯】为了适合当前生产建设的需要，转战时工业为和平建设工业，以加强统一领导及生产的计划性，华北机器制造公司北平机器总厂及其所属三个分厂经多日之积极筹备，于昨（六月三十）日同时成立。过之武管会（管理公私营制造、修理军械之组织）亦同时宣布结束。民营修械所除两家较大者可延至七月后转业外，其余一律限六月底完成转业。该厂前身为北平第一机器厂及第一、第三等几个修械所，原有职工一千四百余人，主要任务为制造与修理军械，因此项生产已不合当前的需要，其转业问题，早已着手计划，并已部分进行和平建设之机器生产，该厂经调整机构，确定人员编制后，即正式成立目前之生产组织。总厂的任务，是在华北机器制造公司领导之下，领导管理总、分厂的生产，无对外经营之任务。
