Those invited to the banquet included Shi Liang, Qiu Zhe, Shi Zhenming, Li Jishen, Li Dequan, Li Xiuzhen, Li Xijiu, Li Da, Li Minxin, Zhu Fusheng, Zhu Zaoguan, Shen Junru, Shen Zijiu, He Xiangning, Zhou Jianren, Zhou Xinmin, Yi Lirong, Guan Wensen, Hu Yuzhi, Guo Guanjie, Hou Wailu, Chen Qiyuan, Chen Cisheng, Chen Qiyou, Zhang Lan, Zhang Wen, Zhang Xiruo, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Chong, Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Zhizhang, Zhang Zhenduo, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, Xu Deheng, Zeng Zhaolun, Gao Shuxun, Peng Zemin, Ye Shengtao, Fu Zuoyi, Huang Dingchen, Chu Tunan, Lei Rongke, Zheng Zhenduo, Jian Bozan, Cai Tingkai, Deng Chumin, Deng Baoshan, Liu Yuhou, Qian Sanqiang, Xie Bangding, Han Zhao'e, Tan Pingshan, Luo Longji (listed in order of the number of strokes in their surnames), and over two hundred others. The atmosphere was filled with unity, joy, and excitement. Chairman Dong Biwu first raised his glass in congratulations. In an excited tone, he celebrated the great victory of the People's Liberation War, celebrated the establishment of the preparatory committee for the New Political Consultative Conference, and wished the New Political Consultative Conference a successful opening and the founding of the People's Republic of China. Dong Biwu emphasized that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries should be convened as soon as possible based on the Potsdam Conference Agreement to discuss the Japanese peace treaty. He also said that only the government of the People's Republic of China, established after the convening of the New Political Consultative Conference, is the only government in China entitled to send representatives, and no one should obstruct or oppose it. Nie Rongzhen said in his speech: In the past, we always commemorated the "July 7th" Incident with a heavy heart, but this year we commemorate it with a happy mood. In the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we fought heroically and sacrificed blood. In the three years of the People's Liberation War, we also paid a great price. Now, we have won. This victory was achieved under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Today, we should celebrate happily. Li Jishen spoke on the spot, praising the great victory of the Chinese people in the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the three years of the Liberation War. He said, "How was this victory achieved? This is because we have the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, so we have won." This banquet was held on the eve of the twelfth anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident, and those who participated included representatives of democratic parties and people's organizations in Beiping, as well as well-known democratic figures. This symbolizes the great unity of China's democratic forces and the broad and solid nature of the national-democratic united front. Relying on this united front, we defeated Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by U.S. imperialism. Relying on this united front, we will surely achieve the great victory of building a people's democratic republic.
