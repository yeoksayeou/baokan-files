Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 27th: After Shanghai was hit by a typhoon on the evening of the 24th, the weather cleared up by the 26th. Most of the city's shops have reopened. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government held a meeting on the 26th, presided over by Mayor Chen Yi, to rescue the typhoon disaster. The meeting decided to continue providing relief to disaster victims and to quickly investigate the damage to seawalls in Baoshan, Pudong, and other areas. It was also decided that the East China Financial and Economic Affairs Takeover Committee and the Municipal Government Works Department would be responsible for planning the emergency repair of the Baoshan seawall and the Pudong sluice gate, respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 27th: The typhoon that landed in eastern Zhejiang on the 24th of this month fiercely attacked the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the city of Nanjing was also affected. On the afternoon of the 25th, Nanjing was hit by sudden winds and rain, and the Yangtze River water level rose sharply to 9.10 meters, only 0.19 meters lower than the highest historical water level of 9.29 meters. The river water overflowed the embankment in areas such as Xiaguan Wharf and Sanchahe Yanzi Rock. Breaches occurred in the Yangtze River embankments in Liuzhou Embankment in Pukou and Jiangxinzhou in the western suburbs. The Nanjing Flood Control Committee and local district people's governments immediately mobilized laborers for emergency repairs, and more than 7,000 sacks were promptly transported to dangerous work sites. More than 2,000 residents were mobilized in the Xiaguan area to carry out repairs in the face of storms. The 20-zhang breach in the Daliudi Embankment in Pukou has been blocked after rescue by the military and civilians. On the evening of the 25th, the Nanjing Military Control Commission also ordered all troops and district governments to strengthen nighttime patrols to prevent any further accidents on the river embankment.
