    Respected Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

    Today, as the two million people of Beiping City commemorate the 12th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, we extend our highest respect to you and the Chinese People's Liberation Army under your leadership—the most reliable and powerful defender of our motherland's people!

    Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and you, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with arduous and indomitable perseverance and a high degree of self-sacrifice, defended the motherland in the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, defeated Japanese imperialism, liberated the Chinese nation from the enslavement of the Japanese aggressors, and, in the three-year People's Liberation War, defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by American imperialism and are about to liberate all of China. We and the people of the whole country sincerely thank you.

    Today, as we commemorate the 12th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, at a time when the People's Republic of China is about to be born, we are joyful! We are encouraged! We are determined, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and you, to fully support the People's Liberation Army, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the remnant forces of the reactionaries, and resolutely defend our great motherland and world peace.
