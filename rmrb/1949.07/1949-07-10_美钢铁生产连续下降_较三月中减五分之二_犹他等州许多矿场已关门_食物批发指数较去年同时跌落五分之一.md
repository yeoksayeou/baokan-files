　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 9th: TASS, New York, 7th - American steel production has fallen sharply again this week, marking the twelfth consecutive week of decline. The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates that the steel industry operated at 61.2 percent of its production capacity this week. This represents a decrease of 23.4 percent from the previous week and 40 percent from mid-March. Meanwhile, Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corporation, an affiliate of U.S. Steel Corporation, announced that another blast furnace in Pittsburgh with an annual production capacity of 379,000 tons has been shut down due to lack of demand for pig iron. In addition, the production of non-ferrous metals continues to decline sharply, thus beginning to create a serious situation in the western mining states. The Utah state government has telegraphed the state's congressional representatives in Washington, urging them to take action to resolve the crisis situation. The situation in Utah is also occurring in other non-ferrous metal producing states, including Nevada and New Mexico. In these states, following the collapse in copper, lead, and zinc prices, many mines have recently closed.
　　According to statistics from the Federal Reserve Bank, department store sales in New York for the week ending July 2nd decreased by 16 percent compared to the same week last year.
　　According to a United Press report on the 6th, the food wholesale price index has fallen to its lowest level since the lifting of livestock price controls on October 8, 1946. The current index is down 20.5 percent from the same week last year. In the face of this shrinking purchasing power and falling prices, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brannan told the Senate Agriculture Committee on the 7th: "The danger of this trend (referring to the decline in agricultural purchasing power) to the entire economy is clear to everyone. We have witnessed depressions (referring to the bourgeoisie's term for economic crises) occurring precisely under these circumstances, and developing uncontrollably."

　　美钢铁生产连续下降
    较三月中减五分之二
  　犹他等州许多矿场已关门
    食物批发指数较去年同时跌落五分之一
    【新华社北平九日电】塔斯社纽约七日讯：美国钢铁生产本周又急遽下降。这是连续下降的第十二周。美国钢铁研究所估计钢铁工业本周发挥了它的生产力的百分之六十一点二。这就是比前一周减少了百分之二十三点四，比三月中旬减少了百分之四十。同时美国钢公司附属的卡尼基伊利诺斯钢公司宣布：因为生铁需求缺少，匹茨堡又有一座每年生产力为三十七万九千吨的鼓风炉停工了。此外，非铁金属生产继续剧烈下降，因此开始造成西部采矿诸州的严重情况，犹他州政府致电华盛顿的该州国会议员，力促采取行动，以解救已达危急阶段的局面。犹他州的情况，也发生在其他生产非铁金属的各州，包括内华达和新墨西哥。在这些州里，继铜、铅、锌价格暴跌之后，最近有许多矿场关门了。
    据联邦准备银行的统计，纽约百货商店的销售量，在二日为止的一周比去年同周减少了百分之十六。
    另据合众社六日消息，食物批发价格指数跌落到一九四六年十月八日取消牲畜价格管制以来的最低水平。目前的指数比去年同周的水平跌落了百分之二十点五。在这种购买力缩小，价格跌落的情况下，美国农业部长布伦南七日向参院农业委员会说：“这种趋势（指农产品购买力下降）对整个经济的危险是每个人都明白的。我们曾经目睹正是在这种情形之下发生过萧条（按即资产阶级对经济危机的说法），并且发展得不可收拾。”
