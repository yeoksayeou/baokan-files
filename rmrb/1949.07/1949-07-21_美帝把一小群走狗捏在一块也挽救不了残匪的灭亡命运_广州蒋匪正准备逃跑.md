Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th - After the U.S. imperialists gathered a small group of lackeys such as Chiang Kai-shek, Quirino, and Syngman Rhee in the Philippines to form the so-called "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance," they gathered another small group of lackeys such as Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and Yan Xishan in Guangdong to form a so-called "Kuomintang Extraordinary Committee," with Chiang Kai-shek as chairman and Li Zongren as vice-chairman, and Yan Xishan, He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Sun Ke, Chen Lifu and others as members, as the highest decision-making body of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang. This was formed by Chiang Kai-shek after he flew from Taiwan to Guangzhou on the 14th. The U.S. imperialists instigated this measure in order to unite the remaining forces of the Chinese reactionaries and carry out a desperate struggle. The Kuomintang bandit gang, under the instigation of the U.S. imperialists, has recently carried out a series of desperate struggles. Since the 26th of last month, bandit ships have been blockading the mouth of the Yangtze River and the coast north to the Shandong Peninsula. Bandit planes have also indiscriminately bombed Shanghai, Nanjing and other liberated peaceful cities and peaceful residents in northern Fujian. In addition, the bandit gang is planning to organize so-called "International Volunteer Corps" and so-called "Special Air Force," attempting to collude with foreign bandits to harass the sacred borders of the Chinese people's motherland. According to the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Daily News on the 6th of this month, the notorious American gangster Chennault will go to Guangzhou with some American "volunteers" and will obtain Chinese nationality. At the same time, the pseudo-Guangdong Provincial Council also passed a resolution on the 6th to "bestow" Chennault as an "Honorary Citizen of Guangdong Province." Another noteworthy conspiracy is that Chiang Kai-shek's confidant Wu Tiecheng will soon go to Japan to meet with MacArthur. These conspiratorial arrangements of the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek are all carried out under the instruction and direct assistance of the U.S. imperialists. However, under the new victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, the U.S. imperialists and the Chiang bandits also know that all struggles cannot save them from the fate of complete destruction in China. Chiang Kai-shek, despite boasting of his "determination to defend Guangzhou," is actually preparing to leave quickly with his accomplices. The major documents of the pseudo-government departments are being moved to Chongqing, and the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense is using twenty-one special planes to rush military documents and equipment away from Guangzhou.

　　美帝把一小群走狗捏在一块也挽救不了残匪的灭亡命运
    广州蒋匪正准备逃跑
    【新华社北平二十日电】美帝国主义者在菲律宾将蒋介石、季里诺、李承晚等一小群走狗捏在一块，组织所谓“太平洋反共同盟”以后，又在广东将蒋介石、李宗仁、阎锡山等一小群走狗捏在一块，组织一个所谓“国民党非常委员会”，由蒋匪任主席，以李宗仁为副主席，阎锡山、何应钦、张群、孙科、陈立夫等人为委员，作为国民党残余匪帮的最高决策机关。这是蒋介石于十四日自台湾飞往广州后组成的。美帝国主义者策动这一措施，为的是纠合中国反动派的残余力量，进行垂死挣扎。国民党匪帮在美帝国主义者的主使下最近进行了一连串的垂死挣扎活动。自上月二十六日起，匪舰即在长江口及其以北直至山东半岛的沿海实行封锁。匪机亦滥肆轰炸上海、南京一带和闽北的已解放的和平城市与和平居民。此外，匪帮正计划组织所谓“国际义勇队”及所谓“特别空军”，妄图勾结外寇，骚扰中国人民祖国的神圣边疆。据本月六日香港华侨日报载称：臭名昭著的美国棍徒陈纳德将和一些美国“志愿兵”到广州，并将要取得中国籍。与此同时，伪广东省参议会亦于六日通过“颁赠”陈纳德为“广东省荣誉公民”。另一可注意的阴谋，是蒋匪亲信吴铁城即将赴日与麦克阿瑟会谈。匪首蒋介石的这些阴谋布置，无一不是在美帝国主义者授意并直接援助之下进行的。然而，在人民解放军的新的胜利进军下，美帝国主义者和蒋贼也知道一切挣扎都挽回不了他们在中国全部灭亡的命运。蒋匪就是尽管吹嘘“决心保卫广州”，但实际上他和他的同伙都在准备赶快离开。伪政府院部的大宗文卷正迁往重庆，伪国防部正用二十一架专机赶运军事文件和装备离开广州。
