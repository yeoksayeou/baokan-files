Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 10th: The International Democratic Women's Federation (IDWF) informed the All-China Democratic Women's Federation (ACDWF) in mid-May regarding the incidents in April of this year where Indian and Argentine police unreasonably arrested and massacred democratic women. The letter stated: On April 27th, women in Calcutta responded to the call of the Women's Self-Defense League of West Bengal and gathered to hold a demonstration in support of the hunger strike being carried out by hundreds of political prisoners protesting their maltreatment. However, before they could leave the venue, they were shot at by the police. Many women, holding their children, fell into pools of blood. Seven people were killed on the spot, four of whom were active members of the Women's Self-Defense League. By April 29th, the residences of all outstanding female workers belonging to the Women's Self-Defense League were searched by patrol police, many leaders were arrested, and the League's office was closed. The letter said of the incident: This is not the first time the Indian government has killed and arrested women. In the past six months alone, more than a dozen women have been killed by the police, and hundreds of democratic women have been arrested and imprisoned without trial. Among those arrested is Manikkuntala Sen, one of the leaders of the West Bengal Women's Self-Defense League and a member of the Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation.

Regarding the Argentine incident, the letter stated: In April, twenty-eight members of the Argentine Women's Union were arrested for participating in democratic and peace movements. After their arrest, they were subjected to humiliation and torture that only Nazi fascists would commit. The IDWF pointed out in the letter: These facts occur so frequently and so widely that they undeniably prove that this method of oppression is systematic and is carried out on the orders of the governments of those countries against the women's movements in those countries. The IDWF has protested to the Nehru government of India and the Perón government of Argentina.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 10th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation received a letter from the International Democratic Women's Federation in late June, learning of the atrocities committed by Indian and Argentine police in unreasonably arresting and massacring democratic women. On behalf of its 22.2 million members, the Federation sent serious protests to the Nehru government of India and the Perón government of Argentina on the first of this month.

The Democratic Women's Federation stated in its protest letter to the Indian government:

"The Indian governments at all levels not only fail to lead their compatriots in the cause of national liberation, enabling the Indian people to be quickly liberated from colonial slavery, but instead cruelly massacre patriots who are fighting for national independence and for improving their lives, suppress democratic movements, and arrest and kill democratic women. This behavior of the Indian government is actually supporting British and American imperialism. The reactionary Kuomintang government of China also did this, but not only did it not defeat the people with the help of imperialism, but instead embarked on the road to destruction. This should be a mirror for the Indian government."

The Democratic Women's Federation stated in its protest letter to the Argentine government:

"Twenty-eight members of the Argentine Women's Union were arrested merely for participating in democratic and peace movements, and they were subjected to various humiliations and tortures. This shows that there is no democracy in Argentina, and human rights are not guaranteed in the slightest."

Both protest letters also demanded that the governments of the two countries: (1) must not again allow events of suppressing national democratic movements and massacring innocent people to occur; (2) immediately take measures to protect the civil rights of the two countries, compensate the families of the deceased, and release the arrested women.

　　国际妇联函告我全国妇联
    印、阿政府迫害民主妇女
  　我国妇联提严重抗议
    【新华社北平十日电】国际民主妇女联合会于五月中旬函告中华全国民主妇女联合会关于今年四月间印度及阿根廷警察无理逮捕屠杀民主妇女的事件说：四月二十七日，加尔各答妇女响应西孟加拉妇女自卫联盟的号召，集会准备举行示威，以支援几百个政治犯正在进行的抗议虐待的绝食斗争。但她们还没有走出会场，就遭到警察的射击。许多妇女抱着孩子倒在血泊中。当场被杀死的有七人，其中四个是妇女自卫联盟的积极分子。至二十九日，所有属于妇女自卫联盟的优秀女工的住宅都遭到了巡警的搜查，许多领导分子被捕，联盟的办事处被封闭。该信对此次事件说：这并非印度政府杀害逮捕妇女的第一次。仅在过去六个月中，就有十几个妇女为警察所杀害，有几百民主妇女被捕，并且未经审问就关进监狱。被捕者里面有西部孟加拉妇女自卫联盟的领导者之一及国际民主妇联执行委员之一的曼尼孔塔拉·沈。
    关于阿根廷事件，该信说：四月里，阿根廷妇女联合会有二十八个会员因为参加民主运动、和平运动而被捕。被捕后她们受到了只有纳粹法西斯分子才做得出来的凌辱与拷问。国际民主妇联在信中指出：这些事实如此经常如此广泛地产生，无可争辩地证明了这种压迫方法是有系统的，而且是出于各国政府的命令来反对各该国的妇女运动的。国际民主妇联已向印度的尼赫鲁政府及阿根廷的皮隆政府提出抗议。
    【新华社北平十日电】中华全国民主妇女联合会于六月下旬接获国际民主妇联来信，得悉印度及阿根廷警察无理逮捕屠杀民主妇女的暴行后，特代表该会二千二百二十万会员于本月一日分别向印度尼赫鲁政府及阿根廷皮隆政府提出严重抗议。
    民主妇联在致印度政府的抗议书称：
    “印度各级政府不但不领导自己的同胞从事民族解放事业，使印度人民迅速从殖民地的奴役下解放出来，反而残酷地屠杀为民族独立，为改善生活而奋斗的爱国者，镇压民主运动，捕杀民主妇女。印度政府的这种行为，实为英美帝国主义张目。中国国民党反动政府也曾如此，可是非但没有因为帝国主义的帮助而战胜人民，反而走上了灭亡的道路。这应该是印度政府的一面镜子。”
    民主妇联在致阿根廷政府的抗议书中称：
    “阿根廷妇女联合会的二十八个会员仅仅因为参加民主运动，参加和平运动而被捕，而且受着各种凌辱与拷问。可见在阿根廷毫无民主可言，人权丝毫得不到保障。”
    两封抗议书中并要求该两国政府：（一）今后不得再次发生镇压民族民主运动，屠杀无辜人民的事件。（二）立即设法保障该两国的公民权，赔偿死者家属，释放被捕妇女。
