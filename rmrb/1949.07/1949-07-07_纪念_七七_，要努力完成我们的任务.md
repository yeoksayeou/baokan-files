Xinhua News Agency, Ulanhot, 6th: Yun Ze, Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, recently wrote an article commemorating "July 7th," entitled "Commemorating 'July 7th,' We Must Strive to Complete Our Tasks." The text is as follows:

　　The anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War is already twelve years.

　　Over the past twelve years, the world, China, and Inner Mongolia have all undergone tremendous changes. And now, the giant wheel of revolution is accelerating, and an even greater era has already begun. The new Political Consultative Conference is about to be convened, and an independent, free, peaceful, unified, and strong People's Republic of China will soon appear on the Asian continent.

　　In the past years of suffering, the people of Inner Mongolia, under the oppression of imperialism, Kuomintang Han chauvinism, and feudal forces, endured endless pain and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, continuously waged arduous and tortuous struggles. Today, the Kuomintang reactionaries have been declared extinct, and a victorious situation is unfolding before us. What more should we strive to do? That is to say, what tasks should the people of Inner Mongolia strive to complete when commemorating the twelfth anniversary of the Chinese nation's war of resistance?

　　It has been more than two years since Inner Mongolia implemented autonomy. Thanks to the victorious struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the concerted efforts of the people of the autonomous region, the great assistance of the military and civilians in the Northeast, North China, and Northwest liberated areas, and especially under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao of the CCP, our work in all aspects has achieved great results.

　　The People's Army of Inner Mongolia, in coordination with the Northeast and North China Liberation Armies, bravely fought and, over the past two years, has crushed countless offensives by the Kuomintang bandit troops against the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, eliminating more than 20,000 enemies. In agricultural areas, the people of Inner Mongolia, with their own hands, abolished all privileges of feudal princes and nobles, abolished feudal land ownership, and the Mongol and Han people have established completely equal relations, jointly participating in governments at all levels and equally dividing land, houses, livestock, and farm tools. In pastoral areas, under the call of "prosperity for both people and livestock," livestock has been increasing year by year. Other aspects, such as the languages, writing, history, culture, and customs of the Mongol and Han nationalities, are also equally respected and developed.

　　All these obvious facts are beyond doubt. They have begun to change the poverty, backwardness, and ignorance of Inner Mongolia caused by foreign and feudal oppression, have changed the various prejudices, estrangements, and discriminations between the Mongol and Han nationalities left over from history, and will continue to change.

　　However, we must never only see these achievements, let alone be satisfied with them. We should see that the remnants of the Kuomintang forces are still entrenched in West Mongolia, where the people are not completely liberated; enemies still exist inside and outside Inner Mongolia. Our working foundation is not yet solid, and there are still many problems to be solved urgently. The policy and ideological levels of our cadres are still very low, and we lack work experience. In the future, we will encounter more and more complex difficulties in engaging in various constructions, which must be overcome through hard work.

　　Therefore, the current task of the people of Inner Mongolia is very clear: on the one hand, the military and civilians of Inner Mongolia should continue to work hard, cooperate with the Liberation Army in combat, vigorously support the front lines, actively participate in the great struggle to liberate West Mongolia, and completely eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries there, liberating the entire Inner Mongolia. Moreover, we must have a sufficiently clear understanding of the enemies existing inside and outside, and we cannot be the slightest bit negligent or slack. Because although American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries have failed, they will never give up. They will still try every means to send their lackeys and use hidden Mongol and Han traitors to sabotage the liberation cause of the people of Inner Mongolia. The Mongol and Han people of Inner Mongolia must raise the greatest vigilance against these conspiracies. If American-Chiang lackeys, Mongol traitors, or Han traitors dare to carry out sabotage and disruption, we should resolutely, thoroughly, and completely smash them. On the other hand, after the people of Inner Mongolia have achieved equality and autonomy politically, if they do not vigorously improve economically and culturally and remain stagnant in their original state, then the Inner Mongolian people will not have achieved true and complete liberation. Therefore, the task of economic construction should occupy an overwhelming position in the current work. All other work should be and must be carried out around the task of completing economic construction. We should raise the level of agricultural, pastoral, and industrial production in the autonomous region on the existing level, so that it continues to develop. We should improve the level of production technology of the Mongolian people, improve the people's lives, and make them increasingly prosperous. If we can do this and achieve these things, we will provide sufficient conditions for us to restore and develop the people's cultural and educational undertakings, so that the Inner Mongolian people will gradually prosper and develop. Of course, this is a long-term and arduous task that cannot be completed in one morning. But precisely because of this, we need to be diligent, humble, and studious, not arrogant or impetuous, continue to maintain the style of hard struggle, and make every greatest effort to complete it.

　　On the eve of the convocation of the new Political Consultative Conference, we wholeheartedly wish it success. Based on past experience, we firmly believe that a democratic coalition government jointly participated in by various democratic parties and revolutionary classes under the leadership of the CCP will more closely unite all ethnic groups to jointly build a new democratic China, and will surely enable all ethnic groups in China to obtain completely equal and unlimited development prospects.

　　纪念“七七”，要努力完成我们的任务
    内蒙自治政府主席  云泽
    【新华社乌兰浩特六日电】内蒙人民自治政府主席云泽顷撰文纪念“七七”，题为“纪念‘七七’，要努力完成我们的任务”，文如下：
    “七七”抗战纪念日已经是十二周年了。
    十二年来，世界、中国与内蒙，都经历了巨大变化。而现在，革命的巨轮加速推进，一个更伟大的时代业已开始了。新的政治协商会议即将召开，独立、自由、和平、统一和强盛的中华人民民主共和国，不久即将出现在亚洲大陆上。
    在过去的苦难岁月里，内蒙古民族人民在帝国主义、国民党大汉族主义与封建势力的压迫下，曾经忍受了无穷尽的苦痛，在中国共产党的领导下，也曾经持续不断的进行了艰苦曲折的斗争。今天，国民党反动派已宣告灭亡，胜利的形势展开在面前，我们应该更加努力奋发地做一些什么？这就是说，内蒙古人民在纪念中国全民族抗战的十二周年的时候，应当努力完成什么任务呢？
    内蒙古实行自治以来，已经两年多了。在中国人民解放军英勇斗争的胜利下，在自治区人民一致努力下，在东北、华北和西北解放区军民的极大援助下，特别是在中共毛主席的英明领导下，我们各方面的工作，是有着很大成绩的。
    内蒙古的人民军队，配合东北、华北解放军英勇作战，两年来，曾经粉碎了国民党匪军对内蒙自治区无数次的进攻，歼敌达二万余。在农业区，内蒙古人民以自己的双手，废除了一切封建王公贵族的特权，废除了封建的土地所有制，蒙汉人民已经建立了完全平等的关系，共同参加各级政权，都同样分得了一份土地、房屋、牲畜与农具。在游牧区，在“人畜两旺”的号召下，牲畜是逐年有所增加。其他如蒙汉民族的语言文字、历史、文化、风俗习惯等，也莫不同样受到尊重和同样得到发展。
    所有这一些明显的事实，是无庸置疑的。它已经开始改变了内蒙在异民族和封建压迫下所造成的种种贫困落后愚昧的面貌，已经改变了历史上遗留下的蒙汉民族与不应有的种种成见隔阂与歧视，而且还将继续的改变着。
    但是，我们是绝不能仅仅看到这一些成绩，更不能以此为满足的。我们应该看到西蒙还有着国民党残余势力在盘踞着，那里的人民没有完全解放；内蒙内部与外部的敌人还存在。我们的工作基础还不稳固，还有许多问题急待解决。我们干部的政策水平、思想水平还很低，工作经验缺乏，而在今后从事各种建设中，一定会碰到更多更复杂的困难，必须努力克服。
    因此，内蒙古人民当前的任务，很显然的就在于：一方面，内蒙古军民应继续努力，配合解放军作战，大力支援前线，积极参加解放西蒙的伟大斗争，彻底肃清国民党反动派在那里的残余势力，解放全部内蒙古。而对于内部与外部存在的敌人，又必须有足够清楚的认识，不能有丝毫的麻痹松懈。因为美帝国主义与国民党反动派虽然是失败了，但他们是绝不会死心的，他们仍将千方百计地派遣他们的走狗和利用暗藏的蒙奸汉奸，来破坏内蒙人民的解放事业。内蒙古的蒙汉人民，必须对于这些阴谋活动提起最大的警觉，不论美蒋走狗蒙奸、汉奸，如他们敢于进行破坏和捣乱，我们就应坚决彻底干净全部地予以粉碎。另一方面，内蒙古人民在政治上业已取得平等与自治之后，如果不在经济文化上大力提高，仍停滞在原来的状态，那么内蒙古民族就没有获得真正的完全的解放。因此经济建设的任务，就应在当前的工作中，占有压倒一切的地位。一切其他的工作，都应该是而且必须是围绕着完成经济建设的任务来进行。我们应把自治区内的农业、牧业和工业生产，在现有的水平上提高一步，使之继续发展。应该提高蒙古人民生产技术的水准，改善人民的生活，使之日益富裕起来。我们能够这样做并做到这些，就使得我们恢复和发展人民的文化教育事业，提供了充分的条件，这样内蒙古民族就会逐步兴盛发展起来。当然，这是一个长期艰苦的工作，不是一个早上就能够完成的。但正因如此，就更需要我们勤勤恳恳，虚心学习，不骄不躁，继续保持艰苦奋斗的作风，尽一切最大的努力去完成它。
    值此新的政治协商会议召开前夕，我们以满怀的热望预祝它的成功。根据以往经验，深信一个在中共领导下的各民主党派各革命阶级共同参加的民主联合政府，是一定会更亲密的团结各民族，来共同建设新民主主义的新中国，是一定会使中国境内各民族，均能获得完全平等与无限发展的前途的。
