Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 21st - The Military Control Commission of Wuhan Municipality's transportation takeover work, which began in early June, is now nearing completion. A total of 46 transportation enterprises, including railways, highways, shipping, post, and telecommunications, have been taken over, involving more than 18,000 people. The main units include: the Pinghan Railway Administration, the Yuehan Railway Wuhan Office, the Second District Highway Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications' Highway General Bureau, the Hubei Provincial Highway Bureau, the State-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hankou Branch, the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the Third Transportation Vessels Team of the Joint Logistics, the Meteorological Observatory, the Third District Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and the Hubei Postal Administration. There are two main characteristics of the transportation takeover work: First, the principle of "not disrupting the original enterprise structure, taking over while restoring transportation" was implemented, enabling Wuhan's external water, land, postal, and telecommunications traffic to be mostly restored in a short period. For example, on the fourth day after the liberation of Wuhan, a railway workers' repair team was formed and dispatched for emergency repairs. The Shipping Department handled the resumption of navigation while taking inventory of ships. The Highway Bureau used the original organization to quickly carry out surveying and bridge repair and road restoration projects around Wuhan. Second, the assistance of the underground CCP organization and the broad masses of workers and staff was obtained, making the work proceed extremely smoothly. Before liberation, the underground CCP had led the enterprises in anti-sabotage and factory protection struggles, protecting a large number of machines, materials, and various documents and archives. For example, the staff of the Telecommunications Bureau used a large number of new wooden boxes to pack eighty tons of scrap iron. When the White bandit Chongxi fled, he took all of these new wooden boxes, while the complete equipment was preserved. In the postal sector, except for one transport ship that was bombed and sunk, all the rest was intact. In the takeover work, some workers, staff, and technicians were also systematically absorbed to participate in the inventory committees. Because they were familiar with the situation, they were of great help to the takeover work. At the same time, because they participated in the inventory work, the general staff initially established the idea that they would be the masters of the state-owned enterprises in the future, which prepared the ground for future workers' movements. There were also some shortcomings in the takeover work in Wuhan. For example, a few cadres had a vague understanding of the takeover principle of not disrupting the original enterprise structure. Some advocated "completely overthrowing and making a fresh start"; some lacked confidence in maintaining the original organization and immediately resuming work; and some mechanically understood it as remaining unchanged, and did not dare to make possible and appropriate adjustments to some unreasonable personnel and systems in the original bureaucratic organization. Some cadres also had biased views on the old employees, believing that most of them were embezzlers and did not dare to boldly employ them; but on the contrary, some cadres believed that they were all technical personnel and did not dare to lead them. In addition, in some units, military representatives and trade union cadres could not closely cooperate and did their own thing. These shortcomings, to varying degrees, hindered the work.

　　武汉铁路邮电交通机构
    接管工作近全部完成
　  水陆邮电交通大部恢复
    【新华社汉口二十一日电】武汉市军管会的交通接管工作，自六月初开始迄今已近全部完成，共接管铁路、公路、航运、邮政、电讯等交通企业单位四十六个，一万八千余人。其中主要单位有：平汉铁路管理局、粤汉铁路武汉办事处、交通部公路总局第二区公路工程管理局、湖北省公路局、国营招商局汉口分局、交通部长江区航政局、联勤船舶第三队、气象台、交通部第三区电讯局、湖北邮政管理局等。交通接管工作中有以下两个特点：第一是贯彻了“不打乱原来的企业机构，一面接收，一面恢复交通”的方针，使武汉对外各水陆邮电交通，于短期内即大部恢复。如武汉解放后的第四天，即组成铁路工人抢修队出发抢修。航运处在点收船只时，即办理复航事宜。公路局利用原有机构迅速进行了武汉周围公路的勘察和修桥、复路等工程。其次为得到中共地下党组织与广大职工的协助，使工作进行极为顺利。解放前，中共地下党曾领导各企业进行了反破坏护厂斗争，保护大批机器材料和各种文件档案。如电讯局的职工用大批新木箱装了八十吨破铁，白匪崇禧逃窜时把这批新木箱全部运走，而完整的器材却被保留下来。邮政方面除被炸沉一只运船外，其余全部完整无损。在接管工作中，又有计划地吸收了部分工人、职员、技术人员等参加清点委员会。由于他们熟悉情况，对接管工作帮助极大。同时，由于他们参加了清点工作，使一般职工初步树立了自己是今后国家企业主人翁的思想，替以后的职工运动做了准备。武汉市接管工作中也存在着一些缺点。如少数干部对不打乱原来企业机构的接管方针认识模糊，有的主张“完全打垮，焕然一新”；有的对保持原机构立即恢复工作缺乏信心，也有少数干部则机械地理解为一成不变，对于原官僚机构中，若干不合理的人员和制度，亦不敢作可能做到的适当的调整。某些干部对旧职员的看法也有偏差，认为他们大都是贪污分子，不敢大胆任用他们；但相反的有的干部认为他们都是技术人员，不敢去领导。此外有的单位军事代表和职工会干部不能密切地配合工作，各搞一套。这些缺点，都或多或少地妨碍了工作。
