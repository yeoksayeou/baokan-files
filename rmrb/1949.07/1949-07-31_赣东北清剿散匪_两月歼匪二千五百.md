　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 30th—The People's Liberation Army stationed in northeastern Jiangxi, in coordination with local armed forces, has been actively clearing out scattered bandits and has achieved great success in the past two months. According to incomplete statistics, from May 11th to July 10th, in the four districts of Guixi, Shangrao, Fuliang, and Poyang under its jurisdiction, a total of 102 bandits were killed or wounded, 336 bandits were captured, and another 2,030 members of the puppet security teams and puppet district and township armed forces surrendered with their weapons. 7,144 long and short guns, 55 submachine guns, 16 carbines, 115 light machine guns, 5 heavy machine guns, 2 60mm mortars, 122 mortars, 1 flame thrower, and other military supplies were seized.
    After the northeastern Jiangxi area was liberated in late April this year, Kuomintang secret agents, taking advantage of the unstable social order, colluded with local habitual bandits and scattered soldiers and vagrants in Guangfeng, Yushan, Guixi, and other places to organize so-called "special agent regiments," engaging in rampant rape and plunder. The People's Liberation Army in the area then launched a political disintegration and military suppression campaign against the bandits. First, they launched a propaganda offensive in the districts, emphasizing that the ringleaders must be punished, those who were coerced would not be held accountable, and those who performed meritorious service would be rewarded, and called on the masses to assist the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the bandits. In late May, under the awe-inspiring power of the People's Liberation Army and the appeal of the lenient policy, the remnants of the bandit Liu Ruming and more than 800 members of the puppet local teams in various counties along Poyang Lake surrendered to the People's Liberation Army with more than 700 rifles and horses. At the same time, a part of the People's Liberation Army launched a campaign to clear out the remnants of the bandits who were fleeing in the mountains. With the cooperation of the army and the people, the incorrigible habitual bandits Pan Fengkui, Zheng Xiannan, Lai Yisheng, and Xu Dexing were captured alive one after another. At this point, the morale of the masses was greatly boosted, changing their original wait-and-see attitude and actively assisting in the suppression of bandits. Currently, under the leadership of the local people's government, the people in the area have begun to organize bandit suppression and self-defense forces.

　　赣东北清剿散匪
  　两月歼匪二千五百
    【新华社南昌三十日电】驻赣东北人民解放军，在地方武装配合下，积极清剿散匪，两月来已获得很大成绩。据不完全统计，从五月十一日起，至七月十日止，在该区所属的贵溪、上饶、浮梁、鄱阳等四个分区中，共毙伤匪一百零二人，俘匪三百三十六人，另有伪保安团队、伪区乡武装两千零三十人携械投诚。缴获长短枪七千一百四十四枝，冲锋枪五十五枝，卡宾枪十六枝，轻机枪一百一十五挺，重机枪五挺，六零炮两门，迫击炮一百二十二门，火焰喷射器一具，其他军用品一部。
    赣东北地区于今年四月下旬解放后，国民党特务分子，乘社会秩序尚未安定之际，曾先后在广丰、玉山，贵溪等地，勾结当地惯匪及散兵游勇，组织所谓“特务团”，大肆奸淫掳掠。该区人民解放军乃对匪徒展开政治瓦解及军事清剿。首先在分区展开了首恶必办、胁从不问、立功受奖的宣传功势，并号召群众协助解放军进行剿匪。五月下旬，在解放军大军声威震慑及宽大政策感召下，匪刘汝明残部及鄱阳湖畔各县伪地方团队八百余人先后携步马枪七百余枝向解放军投诚。同时，人民解放军一部对流窜山区残匪展开清剿。在军民配合之下，怙恶不悛的惯匪潘凤魁、郑先南、赖以盛、徐德兴，先后被活捉。至此，群众情绪极为振奋，改变了原有的观望态度，积极协助清剿。现该区人民，在当地人民政府领导下，已开始组织剿匪自卫武装。
