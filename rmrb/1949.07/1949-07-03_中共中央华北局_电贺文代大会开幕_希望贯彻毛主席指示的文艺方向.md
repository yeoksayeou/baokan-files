　　CCP Central Committee North China Bureau
    Sends Congratulatory Telegram on the Opening of the Literary and Art Workers' Congress
    Hoping to Implement the Literary and Art Direction Indicated by Chairman Mao
    [Ping City News] The North China People's Government, the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau, and the North China Military Region recently jointly sent a telegram to the Chinese Literary and Art Workers' Representative Congress, which opened in Ping City on the 2nd. The original telegram is as follows: To the First Representative Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers:
    Congratulations on the grand meeting of the nation's literary and art workers and the opening of your representative congress. For decades, China's progressive literary and art workers have cooperated with the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and carried out much beneficial work. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, all patriotic and progressive literary and art workers persisted in heroic and tenacious struggles, demonstrating the role of advanced fighters in China's literary and art circles. After the 1943 Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, the literary and art workers in the liberated areas further clarified their direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, deeply connected with the masses, and achieved many new accomplishments. We hope that the congress will summarize past experiences, continue to promote all the fine traditions of China's new literature and art, unite closely, and strive to implement the literary and art direction indicated by Chairman Mao and build a new China's, people's literature and art.

    【平市讯】华北人民政府、中共中央华北局、华北军区顷联名致电二日在平揭幕的中国文学艺术工作者代表大会，原电如下：中国文学艺术工作者第一次代表大会：
    庆祝全国文艺工作者的大会师及你们代表大会的开幕。几十年来中国进步的文学艺术工作者，曾经配合着中国人民的革命斗争，进行了许多有益的工作。在国民党反动派统治下的一切爱国的前进的文艺工作者坚持了英勇顽强的斗争，表现了中国文艺界先进战士的作用，一九四三年延安文艺座谈会之后，解放区的文艺工作者更明确了自己为工农兵服务的方向，深入联系群众，得到许多新的成就。希望大会总结以往经验，继续发扬中国新文艺的一切优良传统，亲密的团结起来，为贯彻毛主席所指示的文艺方向，建设新中国的、人民的文学艺术而奋斗。
