　　New Democratic Poland
    Li He
    Poland is the largest of the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe. It borders the Soviet Union to the east, the Baltic Sea to the north, Germany to the west, and Czechoslovakia to the south. Post-war Poland has an area of 311,730 square kilometers, equal to Italy or the main part of Great Britain plus Ireland, and larger than Sichuan Province in China. It has a population of 23.8 million (1948), almost all of whom are Poles.
    In the 18th century, Poland was partitioned by Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Tsarist Russia. It was not until 1918 that Poland regained its independence. However, during the twenty-one years from the end of World War I to the outbreak of World War II, the Polish landlord and bourgeois government pursued an anti-Soviet and anti-people policy that was at the beck and call of British and French imperialism. After Hitler seized power in Germany, Pilsudski implemented a pro-German policy, resulting in the tragedy of Poland's destruction by German fascists in 1939.
    During the German occupation, the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish Workers' Party, carried out a national liberation struggle. When the Soviet army defeated the Nazis from east to west, Poland was liberated. After liberation, the Polish people established a people's democratic regime "led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance" (Bierut).
    The vanguard of the Polish working class is the Polish Workers' Party. The Polish Workers' Party was founded in 1942 and is the successor to the revolutionary tradition of the Polish workers' movement and the Communist Party of Poland. During the German occupation, the Polish Workers' Party organized guerrilla warfare and established the Committee of National Liberation and the People's Army. After the liberation of Poland, the Polish Workers' Party led the construction of the country. In December 1948, the Polish Workers' Party and the Polish Social Democratic Party, after purging right-wing elements, merged into the Polish United Workers' Party. This unification strengthened the leading role of the working class in the people's democratic regime. The Polish United Workers' Party has a total of 1.55 million members, including 1 million workers, more than 200,000 farmers, and 300,000 intellectuals. The Polish United Workers' Party occupies 229 of the 444 seats in the unicameral National Assembly, and holds 17 of the 27 positions at the level of cabinet minister or higher, including the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister of Foreign Affairs. The General Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party is Bierut, the President of the Republic of Poland.
    In addition to the Polish United Workers' Party, there are four other parties in Poland: the Peasant Party, the Democratic Party, the Labor Party, and the Polish Peasant Party. The Peasant Party and the Democratic Party have participated in the democratic party bloc with the Workers' Party as its core since the early days of the establishment of the democratic regime. The Peasant Party was formed in September 1944 by democratic elements from the pre-war old Peasant Party. Its main components are the peasant masses who participated in the peasant movement during the war of resistance against Germany, especially during the land reform after liberation. The right-wing elements of the pre-war old Peasant Party formed the Polish Peasant Party in August 1945. Under the control of the traitor Mikołajczyk, this party once became a stronghold for reactionary activities. Only after traitors such as Mikołajczyk were purged did the party begin to turn towards democracy. Now the party is preparing to merge with the Peasant Party. The Democratic Party was formed in September 1944 and combines petty-bourgeois democratic elements, especially intellectuals. The Labor Party was formed in 1937 by the union of the Christian Democratic Party and the National Party. It resumed its activities in the autumn of 1945 and represents petty-bourgeois elements who believe in Catholicism. It also supports democracy, but its attitude is far less firm than that of the Democratic Party.
    The pillars of the Polish people's democratic system also include the following democratic organizations: the Polish Trade Union, which is a mass organization of the working class with 3.56 million members; the Polish Peasants' Mutual Aid Alliance, which is a mass organization of small and middle peasants with 1.2 million members; the Polish Youth League; and the Polish Women's Association (1 million members). In addition, there are cooperatives (5 million members); the Polish-Soviet Friendship Association (1.17 million members) and other organizations.
    After liberation, the Polish people immediately set about building a new Poland. This is a difficult project. First, Poland is the country that suffered the most destruction in the war. During the war and the Nazi occupation, 6.1 million Polish people were killed (half of whom were Jews), 1.1 million were seriously ill, 600,000 were disabled, and material losses amounted to 20 billion US dollars, which is equal to fifteen times Poland's national income in 1938. Second, pre-war Poland was an economically backward agricultural country, where landlords occupied 45% of the country's cultivated land; foreign and domestic monopoly capital controlled production and trade.
    However, difficulties cannot stop the Polish people from moving forward. From 1944 to 1946, Poland implemented a series of policies including land reform, nationalization of large and medium-sized industries, and development of the recovered western territories. On September 6, 1944, the Land Reform Decree was promulgated, confiscating the land of landlords with more than 50 hectares of cultivated land, as well as the land of Germans and their accomplices, and distributing 5.6 million hectares of land to more than 800,000 landless and land-poor farmers in three years. On January 3, 1946, the decree on the transfer of basic sectors of the national economy to state ownership was promulgated, nationalizing enterprises employing more than 50 workers per shift and basic industrial sectors. Enterprises belonging to Germans were nationalized without compensation. In three years, 4.2 million people migrated to the western territories. As a result of the implementation of the reforms, Poland's socio-economic structure has fundamentally changed. The new economic structure has three components: (1) State-owned economic components with a socialist nature, which play a leading role in the national economy, including state-owned large and medium-sized industries, state-owned railway transportation, banks, state-owned and cooperative trade organizations; (2) Small commodity production economic components, which are dominant in quantity, including the small and medium-sized peasant economy, small handicrafts, and small businesses; (3) Capitalist economic components, including private small industries, larger private businesses, rich peasant economy, and large handicraft private enterprises.
    After achieving these initial results, the Polish people began to implement the Three-Year Economic Plan (1947-1949). As Hilary Minc, chairman of the Polish Economic Committee, said, "This plan is the inevitable result of the socio-economic reforms implemented in post-war Poland, and it is an expansion of the land reform and industrial nationalization policies." The purpose of this plan is to restore and exceed the pre-war level of the national economy and the lives of the working people. Facts have proved that the Three-Year Plan will be greatly exceeded. By last year (the second year of the Three-Year Plan), industrial production had already exceeded the pre-war level (1938) by 44%, and this year it will exceed the pre-war level by 52%. Coal production has increased from 27.3 million tons in 1945 to 70.3 million tons in 1948, almost twice the pre-war level. Steel production in the third quarter of last year had already reached the annual production level of 2 million tons this year, exceeding the pre-war level by 35%. Last year, the cultivated land area expanded to 14.26 million hectares, an increase of approximately 4 million hectares compared to before the implementation of the plan (1946); 17,000 tractors were working in the fields; and the harvest of major grains such as wheat and rye reached 11 million tons, exceeding the pre-war level. In November 1948, the rationing system for bread and flour was abolished. Unemployment was completely eliminated, and real wages and people's living standards exceeded pre-war levels. By 1948, industrial production accounted for 64% of the national economy; state-owned enterprises employed 75% of the total number of workers in the country and produced 85% of the total industrial output in the country. Six-tenths of wholesale trade is in the hands of the state, and three-tenths are in the hands of cooperatives. Poland now maintains trade relations with 35 countries (including 23 countries that have signed bilateral trade agreements). In 1948, the total value of foreign trade reached 1 billion US dollars (twice the pre-war level), of which 46% was trade with the Soviet Union and new democratic countries. Since last year, the focus of foreign trade has shifted to the import of capital goods and the export of industrial products.
    All of this shows that Poland has developed into an industrial country, an industrial country where state-owned economy of a socialist nature plays a leading role.
    Bierut pointed out that if it were in Poland ruled by landlords and the bourgeoisie, it would take at least fifteen years to make up for the damage caused to Poland by the war, and six years to heal the wounds inflicted by the Nazis; but under the people's democratic system, all of this was completed within only four years, and the productive forces were greatly developed. This is the superiority of the people's democratic system, which can unleash the infinite creativity of the working people.
    On the basis of the impending completion of the Three-Year Plan, Poland is also carefully formulating the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955) to "build the foundation of socialism." The draft of the Six-Year Plan stipulates that industrial production will increase by 114% compared to this year, of which steel production will more than double the current standard of 2 million tons per year; the number of tractors used on farms will increase to 50,000-60,000, nearly 10,000 villages will be electrified, and state-owned farms with one-tenth of the country's cultivated land will become models of socialist agriculture, and agricultural production will increase by 45% compared to this year; the national income will increase by 97%.
    Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and relying on its own efforts and the assistance of the Soviet Union, the Polish people will develop Poland into a highly industrialized country and lead Poland to a socialist society in accordance with the blueprint of the Six-Year Plan.

　　新民主主义的波兰
    李何
    波兰是东欧新民主国家中最大的一个。东邻苏联，北滨波罗的海，西界德国，南毗捷克斯洛伐克。战后波兰的面积凡三十一万一千七百三十方公里，等于一个意大利，或一个英国本部加上爱尔兰，比我国的四川省大些。人口二千三百八十万（一九四八年），居民几乎全是波兰人。
    波兰在十八世纪曾被德国、奥匈帝国和沙皇俄国瓜分过。到了一九一八年，波兰才恢复了独立。但是，从第一次世界大战结束到第二次世界大战爆发的二十一年期间，波兰地主资产阶级政府所奉行的是听命于法英帝国主义的反苏反人民的政策，希特勒夺取德国政权之后，毕苏斯基更实行了亲德政策；结果造成了一九三九年波兰被德国法西斯灭亡的惨剧。
    在德寇占领时期，波兰人民在波兰工人党领导之下，进行了民族解放斗争。及至苏军从东向西击溃纳粹的时候，波兰就得到了解放。解放后的波兰人民建立起“工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的”（贝鲁特语）人民民主政权。
    波兰工人阶级的先锋队是波兰工人党。波兰工人党成立于一九四二年，是波兰工人运动革命传统和波兰共产党的继承者。在德寇占领时期，波兰工人党组织了游击战争，建立了民族解放委员会和人民军。在波兰解放之后，波兰工人党领导着国家的建设。一九四八年十二月，波兰工人党与清除了右翼分子的波兰社会民主党，合并为波兰统一工人党。这一统一，加强了工人阶级在人民民主政权中的领导作用。波兰统一工人党共有党员一百五十五万人，其中工人一百万人，农民二十余万人，知识分子三十万人。波兰统一工人党在一院制的国民议会四百四十四席中占二百二十九席，在内阁部长以上二十七个职位中，担任总理、副总理、外长等十七个职位。波兰统一工人党的总书记就是波兰共和国总统贝鲁特。
    除了波兰统一工人党外，波兰还有四个政党：农民党、民主党、劳动党和波兰农民党。农民党和民主党从民主政权建立的初期起就参加了以工人党为核心的民主政党集团。农民党是由战前旧农民党中的民主分子于一九四四年九月组成的。主要成份是抗德时期，特别是解放后土地改革时期，参加农民运动的农民群众。战前旧农民党右翼分子则于一九四五年八月，组成波兰农民党，这个党在叛国分子米科拉兹柯控制之下，一时曾成为反动派活动的据点。只有在米科拉兹柯等叛国分子被清洗了之后，该党才开始转到民主方面来。现在该党正准备和农民党合并。民主党产生于一九四四年九月，结合的是小资产阶级民主分子，特别是知识分子。劳动党是一九三七年由基督教民主党和民族党联合而成的，一九四五年秋恢复活动，代表信奉天主教的小资产阶级分子。它也拥护民主，但态度远不及民主党坚决。
    成为波兰人民民主制度支柱的，还有如下的民主团体：波兰职工会，它是工人阶级的群众性组织，拥有会员三百五十六万人；波兰农民互助联盟，它是小农和中农的群众性组织，现有会员一百二十万人，波兰青年联盟；波兰妇女协会（会员一百万）。此外，还有合作社（会员五百万）；波苏友好协会（会员一百一十七万）等团体。
    解放之后，波兰人民立即着手建设新波兰。这是艰巨的工程。第一，波兰是战争中受破坏最烈的国家。在战争和纳粹占领期间，波兰人民被杀害的六百一十万（其中半数是犹太人），重病的一百一十万，残废的六十万，物资损失达二百亿美元，即等于一九三八年波兰国民收入的十五倍。第二，战前波兰原是经济落后的农业国，地主占有了全国耕地百分之四十五；外国和本国垄断资本控制了生产和交易。
    然而困难不能阻止波兰人民的前进。从一九四四年到一九四六年，波兰实行了土地改革，大中工业国有化和开发西部收复区的一连串政策。一九四四年九月六日，颁布了土地改革法令，没收了耕地在五十公顷以上的地主土地以及德国人及其同谋者的土地，三年中把五百六十万公顷土地分给了八十余万户无地和少地农民。一九四六年一月三日，颁布了国民经济基本部门移交国有的法令，把每一轮班雇用五十名以上工人的企业和基本工业部门都国有化了。属于德国人的企业则无代价地收归国有。在三年中，有四百二十万人迁移到西部领土。实施改革的结果，波兰的社会经济机构基本上改变了。新的经济机构有三个成份：（一）社会主义经济性质的国营经济成份，在国民经济中起着领导作用，包括国营大中工业、国营铁道交通、银行、国营和合作社营贸易机构；（二）小商品生产经济成份，在数量占优势，包括居农民经济大多数的中小农经济、小手工业和小商业；（三）资本主义经济成份，包括私营小工业、较大的私营商业、富农经济、大手工业私人企业。
    在取得这些初步成果之后，波兰人民就开始实施三年经济计划（一九四七年——一九四九年）。正如波兰经济委员会主席明兹所说的，“这个计划是战后波兰实施了社会经济改革后的必然的结果，它是土地改革和工业国有化政策的扩大”。这个计划的目的，在于使国民经济和劳动人民生活恢复和超过战前水平。事实证明三年计划将被大大超过。到了去年（三年计划第二年度），工业生产量就已超过战前水平（一九三八年）百分之四十四，而今年将超过战前水平百分之五十二。煤的产量已从一九四五年的二千七百三十万吨提高到一九四八年的七千零三十万吨，几达战前水平的两倍。钢的产量在去年第三季就已达到年产二百万吨的今年水平，超过了战前水平百分之三十五。去年，耕地面积扩大到一千四百二十六万公顷，较之实行计划前（一九四六年）增加了约四百万公顷；已有一万七千架拖拉机在农田上耕作；小麦，裸麦等主要谷物的收获量达到一千一百万吨，超过了战前水平。一九四八年十一月，取消了面包与面粉的配给制。失业完全消灭，实际工资和人民生活超过了战前水平。到了一九四八年，工业生产已占全国经济的百分之六十四；国营企业雇用了占全国工人总数百分之七十五的工人，生产了占全国工业产量总额的百分之八十五。十分之六批发贸易掌握在国家手里，十分之三掌握在合作社手里。现在波兰和三十五国（包括二十三个签订了双边贸易协定的国家）保持着贸易关系。一九四八年对外贸易总值达十亿美元（两倍于战前），其中百分之四十六是与苏联和新民主国家贸易的。从去年以来，对外贸易的重点，转向资本货的输入和工业品的输出。
    这一切说明：波兰已经发展成为工业国，发展成为社会主义性质的国营经济起着领导作用的工业国。
    贝鲁特指出过，假如在地主资产阶级统治的波兰，那么至少需要十五年才能弥补战争给予波兰的损害，需要六年才能医愈纳粹给予的创伤；但在人民民主制度下，这一切只在四年之内就完成了，而且大大发展了生产力。这就是人民民主制度的优越性，它能够发挥劳动人民无穷的创造力。
    在三年计划行将完成的基础上，波兰又在精心制订“建设社会主义的基础”的六年计划（一九五○年——一九五五年）。六年计划草案规定：工业生产比今年增加百分之一一四，其中钢的产量将比现在年产二百万吨的标准提高一倍多；农场上使用的拖拉机将增加到五—六万架，近万个农村将电气化，拥有全国十分之一耕地的国营农场将成为社会主义农业的模范，农业生产比今年将增加百分之四十五；国民收入将提高百分之九十七。
    波兰人民在波兰统一工人党领导之下，依靠自己的努力和苏联的援助，将按照六年计划图案，把波兰发展成为一个高度工业化的国家，把波兰引向社会主义社会。
