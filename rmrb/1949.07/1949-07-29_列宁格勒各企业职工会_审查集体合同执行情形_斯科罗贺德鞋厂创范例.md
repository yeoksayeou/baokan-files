　　Leningrad Enterprises' Trade Unions
    Review Implementation of Collective Contracts
  　Skorokhod Shoe Factory Sets Example
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th] Leningrad Dispatch: Trade union meetings are being held in industrial enterprises here to review the implementation of collective contracts by both the factory management and the workers. The trade union meeting of the Skorokhod Shoe Factory, the largest shoe factory in the Soviet Union, is a typical example. The factory director, Belsky, who used to be a worker in the factory, reported to the trade union members on the management's fulfillment of its obligations at the meeting. Over the past six months, 141,000 rubles have been spent on repairing and renovating workers' apartments. At the suggestion of the workers, the construction of three new apartments has begun. The sanatorium in the beautiful town of Luga, which was destroyed by the war, has been restored. A night sanatorium with bathing and medical departments has also been opened, where fifty workers can receive treatment every month without having to stop working. The management has done a lot of work to improve working conditions. Improved ventilators have been installed in three workshops, and new silent machines have been installed. Fluorescent lights have been installed in the hot rubber hardening workshop to make night shifts more comfortable. At the same time, Chernyava, chairman of the factory's trade union committee, reported at the meeting that the achievements of the shoemakers in fulfilling their obligations have also been significant. They completed the six-month plan ahead of schedule. Labor productivity increased by 18 percent compared with the first half of 1948. The output of first-class quality shoes has also increased.

　　列宁格勒各企业职工会
    审查集体合同执行情形
  　斯科罗贺德鞋厂创范例
    【新华社北平二十八日电】列宁格勒讯：此间的各工业企业正在举行职工会会议，审查工厂经理部与工人双方执行集体合同的情形。苏联最大的鞋厂——斯科罗贺德鞋厂的职工会会议，是一个典型的例子。该厂厂长贝尔斯基是过去该厂的工人，在会上向职工会会员们报告经理部履行它的义务的情形。六个月来，为修理和翻盖职工的公寓花了十四万一千卢布。在工人们的建议下，已经开始建筑三所新公寓。该厂被战争破坏了的设在美丽的卢加城的休养所，业已恢复。设有沐浴医疗部的夜间疗养院也已开幕，每月都有五十名工人无须停止工作到那里去治病。经理部已作了许多工作以改善劳动条件。有三个工作间已装设了改良的通风器，并装置了新的无声机器。在酷热的橡皮硬化工作间装有日光灯，以使夜班工作比较舒适。同时，工厂职工委员会主席车尔尼亚娃在会上报告制鞋工人履行他们的义务，也已取得了巨大的成就。他们提前完成了六个月的计划。劳动生产率比一九四八年上半年增加了百分之十八。头等质量的鞋子产量也增加了。
