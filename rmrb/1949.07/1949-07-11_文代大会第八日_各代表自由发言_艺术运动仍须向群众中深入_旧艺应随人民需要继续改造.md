　　Eighth Day of the Literary and Art Congress
  　Representatives Speak Freely
    Art Movement Must Still Go Deep Among the Masses
    Old Arts Should Continue to Be Transformed According to the Needs of the People
    [This newspaper dispatch] The National Literary and Art Congress continued yesterday (the 10th), chaired by Zhou Yang. In addition to supplementary thematic speeches, representatives also spoke freely, including fourteen people from the fields of military art and literary work, filmmaking, Peking opera, ballad singing, writing, poetry, and art and literature professorship.
    The session began with Dai Ailian giving a thematic speech on dance work. Then, Liu Zhiming, head of the Northeast Delegation, spoke about the literary and art movement in the Northeast. He emphasized that the achievements of Northeast literature and art lay in implementing Chairman Mao's literary and art guidelines, going deep into life, going deep into struggle, expressing the thoughts and feelings of the people, and meeting the needs of the people of the Northeast. The shortcoming was that the mass literary and art work in the Northeast was not done well enough. Deng Zhenduo spoke about how, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, literary and art workers in Shanghai completed the publication of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun" under heavy enemy encirclement. In addition, the theater circles in the Kuomintang-controlled areas compiled and performed some progressive plays under enemy oppression, such as "Wen Tianxiang," performed by Zhou Xinfang, and "Xiang Lin's Wife," performed by Yuan Xuefen. At the same time, he talked about the steadfastness of Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu, who never performed once under enemy oppression. In his speech, writer Zhao Shuli emphasized that feudal old art and literature still had a considerable influence among the masses. We must take the lead with new art and literature and strive to transform old art and literature.
    Film director Cai Chusheng pointed out that China's film industry is backward and must be developed vigorously. Under Chairman Mao's direction, the popularization and improvement of film work must be actively carried out in order to cooperate with the propaganda work of the modern state.
    Professor Chen Wangdao talked about the various restrictions imposed by the reactionaries on the curriculum of Chinese departments in schools and on the reading of literary and artistic books, based on his own teaching experience. He hoped that in the future, attention could be paid to conducting the teaching of new literature and art in schools in a systematic and planned way. Poet Yu Pingbo then recited a poem he wrote after attending the July 1st Party Commemoration Meeting, entitled "The Rain of Red Flags" (see page four of today's newspaper), dedicated to the representatives as his speech.
    In their speeches, Peking Opera and ballad singing representatives Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Dong Tianmin, and Wang Congwen unanimously proposed to work hard to promote the reform of old opera arts, so that old opera arts could be liberated. Under the banner of New Democracy, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will thoroughly serve the people. At the same time, they hoped that all new literary and art workers would help them accomplish this task.
    Next, the conference read out the scientific worker's -- bacteriologist, author of "Autobiography of a Germ" -- Gao Shiqi's opinions on the conference. He emphasized that literary and art workers should unite and cooperate with scientific workers in order to better serve the people.
    Finally, army representative Lai Shaoqi reported on the army's emphasis on literary and art work and the role played by literary and art workers in the army. He called on all representatives to go to the army to engage in literary and art work. Bi Gefei more excitedly spoke of the soldiers' love and need for literature and art, and focused on the fast-board writing movement in the army.
    During the meeting, representatives from the Peking ballad singing circles, Cao Baolu, Hou Baolin, and others, presented a banner to the conference.
