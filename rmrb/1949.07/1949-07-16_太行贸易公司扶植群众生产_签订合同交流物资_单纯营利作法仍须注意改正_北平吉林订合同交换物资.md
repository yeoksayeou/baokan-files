    [Taihang Electric] In order to exert a leading role in the economy, the Taihang Trading Company has been focusing on trial contract signing and material exchange, which has achieved considerable results in the past two months, and some problems have been discovered. In early May, a purchase contract was signed with the Licheng County United Cooperative, with the trading company exchanging products such as edible salt, alkali noodles, and matches for local medicinal materials from Licheng. Subsequently, the Xingtai branch exchanged agricultural products such as grain and oil for industrial products such as various foreign cloths, alkali noodles, and paper from Shijiazhuang and Gaoyang. The Changzhi branch signed contracts to guarantee grain for employees through state-owned factories or employee consumer cooperatives. It also signed goods exchange contracts with the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Trading Company and Industrial Company, exchanging 700,000 jin of Taihang wheat and medicinal materials such as Scutellaria baicalensis, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, and Bupleurum chinense for more than 1,400 boxes of worker-peasant matches, 60,000 jin of sea salt, and some industrial products such as cloth, kerosene, and soap from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area. As of June 10, the trading company had signed 28 contracts with 23 units including cooperatives, state-owned factories, and organs in the region, as well as trade and industrial departments in neighboring regions, including eight purchase and barter contracts, two employee consumption contracts, ten agency purchase and sales contracts, and eight transportation contracts. The trading company spent 3,267,727 jin of grain, 644,820 jin of sea salt, 190,000 square feet of native cloth, 50,000 jin of edible oil, and 1,411 boxes of matches, in exchange for 135,000 jin of wheat, 300,000 jin of sorghum, 45,800 jin of medicinal materials, 9,240 bolts of wide white cloth, 160 bundles of cotton yarn, and 900 jin of kerosene. Signing contracts and exchanging materials is an effective way to guide rural cooperatives towards organizing and promoting production by members. After the Zhangjia Village Cooperative in She County signed a purchase contract with the trade zone company, it actively organized its members to dig medicinal materials, increased the income of its members, and obtained cheap industrial products. Members actively cleared old debts owed, and everyone raised more than 100,000 yuan to expand supply and marketing operations. The main problems currently existing in signing contracts and exchanging materials are: the trading company does not have enough understanding of the production and needs of the masses in the region, and therefore, cannot properly adjust materials, and the planning is not thorough, and production and supply and marketing do not match. In supply and marketing contracts, they still do not understand cost accounting. Cooperatives at the county, district, and village levels do not have a clear enough view of organizing and developing production through the signing of contracts, so in the implementation, the phenomenon of simply completing exchange tasks has arisen, and they have not been able to organize members to produce well.
    [Taihang Electric] The goods exchange contract signed between the Licheng County United Cooperative and the Taihang Trade Zone Company has been completed as scheduled. In the process of executing the contract, many deviations occurred. The main thing is that the signing of the contract was not used to organize the production of members, and it was still a purely profit-making approach. After both parties signed the contract on May 26, the Licheng County United Cooperative immediately convened the heads of the 4th, 5th, and 6th District United Cooperatives to deploy the purchase of medicinal materials. At that time, the cadres of the district cooperatives were not clear enough about the purpose of organizing and promoting the production of members through the contract, so the district and village cooperatives mostly adopted the method of setting up stalls for purchase, and did not organize members to produce. The Gedu Ping small cooperative even went to Wuxiang to purchase 2,000 jin of Scutellaria baicalensis in order to complete the task. Daily necessities such as edible salt, matches, and alkali noodles, which were wholesaled from the trading company, were also hoarded in the district cooperatives, in an attempt to sell them freely. In mid-June, the trading company went to Licheng for inspection, discovered these problems, and immediately studied and corrected them with local party and government cadres. The county united cooperative also convened a meeting of county and district cooperative cadres to conduct inspection and education.
    [Our Newspaper] The exchange of goods between the Beijing Trading Company and various places is increasing day by day. Following the exchange of goods with Liaoxi and Liaodong provinces in Northeast China, it has now reached an agreement with the Jilin Provincial Department of Commerce to exchange goods worth approximately 250 million yuan in order to promote the spirit of mutual benefit and production. The Jilin Provincial Department of Commerce will supply Beijing with tens of thousands of jin of soybean oil and approximately 600,000 jin of white sugar (including four or five cars of white sugar and two or four groups of granulated sugar), and the Beijing Trading Company will exchange goods of equal value, such as figured cloth, colored cloth, printed cloth, towels, vests, socks, diaries, soap, toothbrushes, and more than 40 other items. The exchange of goods between Beijing and Jilin is still in its early stages. During this negotiation, both parties unanimously agreed that if these materials can meet the needs of the two places, they will continue to exchange them in the future.
    [Another News] In the repeated exchanges of goods between the Beijing Trading Company and other places, it was found that the company's produced cloth and knitted goods sometimes did not meet the sales demand. The quality of certain products (such as figured cloth knitted goods) is low and the price is high, which affects sales to other places or exchanges with other regions. In this exchange, it was also found that the prices of cloth, socks, towels, and other products produced in Beijing are higher than those in Northeast China (this time, because mutual assistance was the main focus, both parties appropriately reduced prices, so the exchange was not affected). The company has paid attention to this. In the future, not only should attention be paid to the quality and style of products in supporting production with raw materials for finished products, but also attention should be paid to the importance of guidance and planning in production. Furthermore, it shows that Beijing's products must be smoothly exchanged with various places on the premise of improving quality and reducing costs.

    太行贸易公司扶植群众生产
    签订合同交流物资
    单纯营利作法仍须注意改正
    北平吉林订合同交换物资
    【太行电】太行贸易公司为了在经济上发挥领导作用，有重点的试行签订合同，交流物资，两月来已获相当成绩，并发现了一些问题。五月初，与黎城县联社签定订货合同，贸易公司以食盐、硷面、火柴等产品交换黎城土产药材。继之邢台分公司以粮食、油类等农业品交换石家庄、高阳各色洋布、硷面、纸张等工业产品。长治分公司通过公营工厂或职工消费社签订保证职工粮食的合同。又与冀鲁豫贸易公司、实业公司签订货物交换合同，以太行小麦七十万斤及黄芩、知母、柴胡等药材等价交换冀鲁豫区工农火柴一千四百余箱、海盐六万斤及布匹、煤油、肥皂等工业产品一部。至六月十日止，贸易公司与本区合作社、公营工厂、机关生产及友邻区贸易、实业部门等二十三个单位共订立二十八个合同，包括订货的物资交换合同八个，职工消费合同二个，代购代售合同十个，运输合同八个。贸易公司支出粮食三百二十六万七千七百二十七斤，海盐六十四万四千八百二十斤，土布十九万方尺，食油五万斤，火柴一千四百一十一箱等，换回麦子十三万五千斤，高粱三十万斤，药材四万五千八百斤，宽白布九千二百四十匹，棉纱一百六十捆，煤油九百斤等。签订合同，交换物资，对于引导农村合作社走向组织与推动社员生产，是一种有效办法。涉县张家庄村社与贸易区公司定了订货合同，便积极组织社员刨药材，增加社员收入，又获得廉价的工业品。社员欠款的主动清理了旧欠，大家又集股十余万元，以扩大供销业务。在签订合同，交换物资上，目前存在的主要问题是：贸易公司对于所在地区群众的生产量与需要量，了解不够，因此，不能适当调剂物资，计划不周，生产与供销不相适应。在供销合同上，还不懂成本计算。各地县、区、村合作社对于通过签订合同来组织与发展生产的观点尚不够明确，所以在执行中就产生了单纯完成交换任务的现象，未能很好去组织社员生产的偏向。
    【太行电】黎城县联社与太行贸易区公司签订的换货合同，已如期完成。在执行合同过程中，曾发生不少偏向。主要是没有通过签订的合同，去组织社员生产，仍是单纯营利的作法。当五月二十六日，双方签定合同以后，黎城县联社即召集四、五、六区联社长，布置收购药材。当时，各区社干部对于经过合同组织与推动社员生产的目的不够明确，所以区村社大多采用了设庄收购的办法，没有去组织社员生产。圪都坪小型社，为了完成任务，还去武乡收购了二千斤黄芩。从贸易公司批发来的食盐、火柴、硷面等日用品，也都囤积在区社，企图自由出售。贸易公司六月中旬到黎城检查，发现这些问题，遂即与当地党政干部研究纠正。县联社并召开县、区合作干部会议，进行检查教育。
    【本报讯】北平贸易公司与各地进行物资交换日见增多，继与东北辽西、辽东等省交换物资之后，现又与吉林省商业厅本互通有无，展发生产精神，商妥交换总值人民币约二亿五千万元之物资，合同已于十三日签定。吉林省商业厅以该地所产豆油数万斤及白糖（包括四五车白糖、二四组砂糖两种）约六十万斤供给北平，北平贸易公司以总值相等之货物如花条布、色布、印花布、毛巾、背心、袜子、日记本、肥皂、牙刷等四十余种交换。北平与吉林交换物资尚属初次，在此次商谈中，双方一致认为：如此项物资能适合两地需要，今后将继续进行交换。
    【又讯】北平贸易公司与外地屡次交换物资中，发现该公司所生产之布匹、针织品等时有不合销路者。某些产品（如条布针织品）品质既低，价格反高，影响向外地销售或与外区交换，在此次交换中，又发现北平所产的布匹、袜子、毛巾等价格均较东北为高（此次因系以互助为主，双方适当减低价格，故未影响交换）。该公司对此已引起注意，今后不仅应在扶植生产以原料换成品中要注意产品的质量、样式等，还得注意体现到进行生产中的指导性与计划性的重要。此外更说明北平的产品一定要在提高品质与降低成本前提下才能顺畅地与各地进行交换。
