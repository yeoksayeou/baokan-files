Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th: The Shanghai Liberation Daily published an editorial on the 27th entitled "Crush the Enemy's Blockade and Fight for the Construction of a New Shanghai!" The full text is as follows:

　　When the Chinese people are currently healing the economic wounds caused by the long-term plunder and destruction of imperialism and the Kuomintang, they have favorable conditions and difficult conditions. The favorable conditions are the elimination of the monopoly of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, the powerful national united front led by the Communist Party and the honest and hardworking people's government, the infinite trust and selfless support of the people, especially the working people, for the Communist Party, the experience of the Communist Party and the people of the whole country in long-term self-reliance during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the ability to utilize the experience of the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries. These conditions are factors that are constantly playing a role, and their role will become more and more effective. But there are also difficult conditions, that is, large-scale war must continue for a short period, that is, land reform has not yet been implemented in the vast new rural areas, that is, there are still too many consumer populations in the cities, that is, this year's major floods, and especially hateful are the blockade and other vicious destructive methods recently implemented by imperialism and the Kuomintang. These difficult conditions are serious for the time being, and it will take a period of hard struggle to overcome them. But after all, they are only temporarily functioning factors, they can be completely overcome, and they can never shake the great optimism of the Chinese people about a bright future.

　　These temporary difficulties exist more or less in all liberated areas of the country, but they are more serious in Shanghai. This is because Shanghai's economy originally had its more serious weaknesses. In the past, Shanghai's so-called "prosperity" was not built on an independent and sound economic foundation, but on the basis of the mutual combination of imperialism and comprador bureaucratic capital, forming a special state of deformed development. In the past, the purpose of Shanghai's economic production was mostly for the private interests of a few foreign plunderers and domestic bureaucratic compradors, and thus it was full of unreasonable phenomena such as unrestrained speculation and enjoyment, unrestrained exploitation and oppression, and a large number of unemployed workers. Except for a part of national capital, many other important enterprise departments, especially finance, transportation, water and electricity, were mostly controlled by foreign capital and Chinese bureaucratic comprador capital. Many raw materials and power (such as cotton, grain, fuel, etc.) required for industrial production were also almost entirely dependent on foreign imperialism. This is a typical colonial economic form. Corresponding to this economic structure were Shanghai's old politics and old culture.

　　**Breaking Away from Dependence on Imperialist Economy and Becoming a City Producing for the Domestic Market**

　　As early as before the liberation of Shanghai, we pointed out that in order to ensure the peaceful construction of Shanghai, it is necessary to completely eliminate the aggressive forces of imperialism and to completely wipe out the remnant forces of the Kuomintang. Similarly, in order to transform Shanghai, which is developing in a deformed manner today, into a truly prosperous new Shanghai, it is necessary to make every effort to make Shanghai first get rid of its dependence on the imperialist economy, and it is necessary to transform the city where imperialism and comprador bureaucrats exploited and oppressed the Chinese people into a city that produces for the domestic market and serves the Chinese people. At the same time, we pointed out that in order to transform this morbid and bloated old Shanghai, which has a population of six million but only three million people actually participating in production, into a healthy and prosperous new Shanghai, there needs to be a temporary superficial process of "retreat" and "contraction"; and this temporary superficial "retreat" and "contraction" of old Shanghai is precisely a necessary condition for the long-term steady progress and prosperous development of the new Shanghai in the future.

　　The course of events in the two months since the liberation of Shanghai has fully proved the correctness of our above-mentioned arguments and the necessity of adopting the above-mentioned policies. At the beginning of the liberation of Shanghai, in order to take care of the demands of the people from all walks of life, we adopted, and are still adopting, many cautious transitional measures (such as generous foreign trade policies and encouragement of overseas transportation, tax exemption for cotton imports, and rewards for certain import and export goods, etc.; for example, adopting a lenient policy towards the lurking Kuomintang remnants, hoping that they would change their ways, etc.), trying to avoid excessive fluctuations in order to achieve gradual transformation and wait for the degree of mass awareness to improve. However, imperialism and its running dogs, the Kuomintang remnants, not only did not change their policy of aggression against China and their destructive conspiracy against the Chinese people because of the leniency of the people's government and their own military and political defeat. On the contrary, imperialism is directing its running dogs, the Kuomintang remnants, to continuously bomb and strafe our peaceful residents in Shanghai, and to impose armed blockade on Shanghai and the ports on our coast. They attempt to block our internal and external transportation, cut off our supply of coal, grain and industrial raw materials by barbaric means such as bombing and strafing and armed blockade, so as to undermine our Shanghai production and construction and force us to surrender to imperialism and submit.

　　However, the fact that the imperialists directed the Kuomintang remnants to continuously bomb and strafe the people of Shanghai and to carry out armed blockade against the Chinese people cannot shake the Chinese people's determination to completely drive out the imperialist aggressive forces from China, and it cannot shake the Chinese people's determination to completely eliminate the Kuomintang remnants and strive for the liberation of all of China; on the contrary, the people of Shanghai and the Chinese people have learned from the painful lessons of continuous bombing and armed blockade by the enemy, and more clearly understand that it is impossible to completely accomplish the Chinese people's revolution and smoothly carry out the new democratic construction without completely driving out the imperialist aggressive forces from China and completely eliminating all the Kuomintang remnants. We firmly believe that although the continuous bombing, strafing and armed blockade of us by imperialism and its running dogs will temporarily increase some of our difficulties, it has greatly encouraged our determination to resolutely transform Shanghai in accordance with the above-mentioned correct policies.

　　Comrades of the Party, government, army and people of Shanghai and East China! It has been a month since imperialism directed the Kuomintang remnants to use barbaric means of continuous bombing and armed blockade to threaten the people of Shanghai and East China! We call on you to unite as one in order to crush the enemy's bombing blockade and to build a sound and prosperous new Shanghai, and to resolutely implement the following tasks:

　　**The Party, Government, Army and People Unite to Resolutely Implement Six Major Tasks**

　　(1) Actively support the People's Liberation Army to go south to fight, quickly liberate Fujian and Taiwan, and cooperate with all parts of the country to liberate all other areas that have not yet been liberated. This is the most effective way to respond to enemy bombing and strafing and to crush the armed blockade of Shanghai and the coastal ports by the imperialists and Kuomintang remnants.

　　(2) Implement the evacuation of personnel and the relocation of some schools and factories to the interior in a planned and step-by-step manner. First of all, we should persuade all landlords who fled and landlords, rich peasants, farmers and young people who were deceived by the enemy to come to Shanghai to return to their hometowns immediately and participate in production. Even if some of them are landlords and rich peasants who have oppressed farmers, as long as they can change their ways and go home to produce, the local government and people will definitely give lenient treatment. Mobilize a large number of refugees and unemployed people to reclaim wasteland and produce in the Huangpan area of northern Anhui and the reclamation area of northern Jiangsu. As for mobilizing Shanghai's manpower, floating capital and technology to develop production in rural areas, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has a comprehensive plan. In addition, certain schools and factories should be encouraged to relocate to the interior under possible and necessary conditions, so as to obtain food, coal and raw materials, so as to change the current crowded phenomenon in Shanghai and reduce the burden on the city.

　　(3) Change the future production policy and development direction of Shanghai. Whether public or private enterprises should try to get rid of their dependence on the imperialist economy, and should take producing for the domestic market and serving the Chinese people as the policy and development direction of all enterprises in Shanghai in the future, such as mass producing machines needed by domestic cities and mines, and agricultural tools, fertilizers, and cloth needed by rural areas. Because only when the economic development of domestic cities and the improvement of agricultural productivity are guaranteed can the foundation of Shanghai's industrial production be guaranteed, and can it be self-reliant and get rid of its dependence on imperialism. At the same time, all state-owned enterprises that continue to produce in Shanghai must streamline their organizations, improve efficiency, and conscientiously achieve enterprise and production rationalization.

　　(4) Mobilize a large number of Communist Party cadres, workers and students to go to the countryside to carry out rural work. It is necessary to mobilize a large number of workers, students and Party cadres to work in rural areas, mobilize the broad masses of peasants to eliminate bandits, transform the government, develop production, and carry out land reform systematically and step by step, so as to completely liberate the peasants from feudal oppression and exploitation. This is a task of paramount importance for the entire East China Party at present. Because only by improving the lives of the broad masses of peasants and improving agricultural production can we expand the market necessary for industrial products on the one hand, and supply the cities with more grain and industrial raw materials on the other hand. Because only by relying on the vast domestic market and the vast rural areas to provide sufficient grain and raw materials can Shanghai and the cities in the south of the Yangtze River truly embark on the track of sound and prosperous development.

　　(5) Develop inland transportation and encourage the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Imperialism is directing the Kuomintang remnants to use blockade methods to prevent and cut off our internal and external exchanges; in order to crush the enemy's blockade conspiracy, we must quickly develop inland transportation, encourage the exchange of materials between inland areas, and strengthen mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, so as to develop and prosper the domestic economy.

　　(6) Practice thrift and overcome current difficulties. All Party, government, army and civilian organizations must vigorously streamline their organs, tighten their establishments, clear up their assets, establish systems, save expenses, oppose waste, promote the style of hard work and plain living, and overcome the habits of extravagance and vanity. In particular, our Party cadres must use their own exemplary actions and arduous and outstanding spirit to influence and promote the people of Shanghai and East China to carry out a thrift movement to overcome the current difficulties.

　　We can proudly say that after the liberation of Shanghai, no matter how the imperialists and Kuomintang remnants carry out their sabotage and armed blockade, no matter how much these conspiratorial activities of the enemy may temporarily cause us some difficulties, we will never be discouraged because of this. Because the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, under the leadership of their great leader and mentor Comrade Mao Zedong, have overcome countless serious difficulties in the long revolutionary struggle. For example, the 25,000-mile Long March and the enemy's key offensive in the War of Liberation have been overcome by the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people. What's more, the difficulties Shanghai is currently facing are not only of a clearly different nature, but also at a time when the overall domestic and international situation is unprecedentedly favorable to us and the victory and liberation of the country are about to come. Therefore, our current difficulties are difficulties in victory and development, just like the enemy's blockade that we encountered and successfully overcame during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the result will strengthen our determination to be self-reliant and build the foundation for the prosperous economy of the liberated areas. Therefore, it is wrong to express any pessimism and despair about the current blockade difficulties.

　　Workers, students, all working masses, all progressive industrialists and all patriotic democrats in Shanghai! Mobilize urgently to fight to crush the enemy's blockade! Fight to overcome current difficulties and build a new Shanghai!

　　上海解放日报发表社论
  　号召建设新上海
  　彻底粉碎敌人封锁
    【新华社上海二十八日电】二十七日上海解放日报以“粉碎敌人封锁，为建设新上海而斗争！”为题发表社论，全文如下：
    中国人民在目前医治帝国主义、国民党长期掠夺破坏所造成的经济创伤的时候，有有利的条件，有困难的条件。有利的条件，是消灭了帝国主义和官僚资本主义的垄断，是有共产党领导的强大的全民族统一战线和廉洁勤劳的人民政府，是全国人民首先是劳动人民对于共产党的无限信任和奋不顾身的拥护，是共产党和全国人民具有在抗日战争中长期自力更生的经验，并且可以利用苏联和各新民主国家的经验。这些条件是经常起作用的因素，它们的作用将愈来愈有效。但是也有困难条件，这就是大规模战争还必须继续进行一个短时期，这就是广大的新区农村还没有实行土地改革，这就是城市中还存在着过多的消费人口，这就是今年的大水灾，而尤其可恨的是帝国主义、国民党在最近所实行的封锁和其他的恶毒的破坏办法。这些困难的条件，在暂时是严重的，要战胜它们需要一个时期的艰苦奋斗。但是它们毕竟只是暂时起作用的因素，它们是完全可以克服的，它们决不能动摇伟大的中国人民对于光明前途的乐观。
    这些暂时的困难或多或少地存在于全国各解放区，但是在上海却表现得更严重。这是因为上海的经济本来就有它的更严重的弱点。过去上海的所谓“繁荣”不是建筑在自主的健全的经济基础之上，而是建筑在帝国主义、买办官僚资本相互结合的基础之上，形成一种特殊的畸形发展状态。过去上海经济生产的目的，大部分是为着少数国外掠夺者和国内官僚买办的私利，因而充满着放肆的投机享乐和尽情的压榨剥削以及大批工人失业等不合理的现象。除了一部分民族资本之外，其他很多重要企业部门，特别是金融、交通、水电等大多操纵在外国资本和中国官僚买办资本手中。许多工业生产所需要的原料、动力（如棉花、粮食、燃料等），也差不多主要仰给于国外帝国主义。这是一种典型的殖民地化的经济形态。与这种经济构成相适应的，则是上海的旧政治和旧文化。
  　摆脱对帝国主义经济的依赖变成替国内市场生产的城市
    远在上海解放之前，我们就指出：欲使上海和平建设获得确切的保障，就必须把帝国主义侵略势力完全肃清，就必须把国民党残余势力全部歼灭。同样，欲使今日畸形发展的上海改造成为一个真正繁荣的新上海，就必须用一切努力使上海首先摆脱对帝国主义经济的依赖，就必须变帝国主义、买办官僚剥削压榨中国人民的城市为替国内市场生产和为中国人民服务的城市。同时我们指出：要把拥有六百万人口而实际参加生产的人数不过三百万人的这样一个病态臃肿的旧上海改造成为一个健全繁荣的新上海，就需要有一暂时的表面的“后退”和“紧缩”过程；而这种旧上海暂时的表面的“后退”和“紧缩”，正是将来新上海长期稳步前进和繁荣发展的必要条件。
    上海解放两个月来事变的进程，完全证明我们上述论断的正确和采取上述方针的必要。我们在上海解放之初，为了照顾各界人民的要求，曾采取了而目前仍然采取着许多慎重的过渡办法（例如宽大的对外贸易政策和对海外交通的鼓励方针，对棉花入口的免税及对若干出入口货物的奖励等等；又例如对潜伏的国民党残余分子采取宽大政策，冀其改过自新等等），力图避免过大的波动，以求达到逐渐改造和等待群众觉悟程度提高的目的。但帝国主义及其走狗国民党残余势力不但不因人民政府的宽大和其自身军事政治的惨败而改变其对华侵略政策及与中国人民为敌的破坏阴谋，相反，帝国主义正指使其走狗国民党残余势力向我上海和平居民不断进行轰炸、扫射，并对上海和我海岸各港口实行武装封锁。他们企图以轰炸扫射和武装封锁等野蛮办法，阻塞我内外交通，断绝我煤粮及工业原料的供给，来破坏我上海生产建设和逼我向帝国主义投降，就范。
    可是帝国主义者指使国民党残余势力向上海人民不断的轰炸、扫射和向中国人民进行武装封锁，不但丝毫不能动摇中国人民彻底驱逐帝国主义侵略势力出中国的决心，不但丝毫不能动摇中国人民彻底消灭国民党残余势力和争取全中国解放的决心；相反，全上海人民及中国人民从敌人不断轰炸和武装封锁的痛苦教训中，更清楚懂得非彻底驱逐帝国主义侵略势力出中国，非彻底消灭国民党一切残余势力，要想彻底完成中国人民革命和顺利进行新民主主义的建设是不可能的。我们深信，帝国主义及其走狗对我们的不断轰炸、扫射和武装封锁，虽然暂时增加我们某些困难，但却大大鼓励了我们按照上述正确方针来坚决改造上海的决心。
    全上海全华东的党政军民同志们！帝国主义指使国民党残余势力，用不断轰炸和武装封锁的野蛮手段来威胁我全上海及全华东人民已经一个月了！我们号召你们为了粉碎敌人的轰炸封锁，为了建设健全繁荣的新上海而一致团结起来，坚决实行下列的任务：
    党政军民团结起来坚决实行六大任务
    （一）积极支援人民解放军南下作战，迅速解放福建、台湾，并配合全国各地解放其他一切尚未解放的地区，这是回答敌机轰炸扫射及粉碎帝国主义，国民党残余势力对上海和我沿海各港口武装封锁的最有效的办法。
    （二）有计划地、有步骤地实行疏散人员和实行将部分学校工厂内迁，首先应劝导一切逃亡地主和受敌欺骗来沪的地主富农及被敌压迫来沪的农民和青年，立即各返原乡，参加生产。即使其中有一部分是曾经欺压农民的地主富农，只要他们能改过自新，回家生产，则当地政府和人民定能宽大处理。动员大批难民与失业群众到皖北黄泛地区和苏北垦区垦荒生产。至于动员上海的人力、游资及技术到农村发展生产，上海市人民政府已有全面计划。此外应在可能和必要的条件下，鼓励某些学校工厂内迁，以便就粮、就煤、就原料，以改变目前上海拥挤现象，减少城市负担。
    （三）改变今后上海生产方针和发展方向。无论公营或私营企业都应设法摆脱对帝国主义经济的依赖，并应把为国内市场生产及为中国人民服务作为今后上海一切企业生产的方针和发展方向，如大量生产国内各城市、各矿山所需要的机器及农村所需要的农具、肥料、布匹等。因为只有国内各城市经济发展和农业生产力提高，上海工业生产基础才有保证，才可以自力更生和摆脱对帝国主义的依赖。同时留在上海继续生产的各公营企业，必须精简组织，提高效率，认真做到企业化和生产合理化。
    （四）动员大批共产党员干部和工人学生到农村去开展农村工作。必须动员大批工人学生与党员干部到农村工作，动员广大农民群众肃清土匪、改造政权、发展生产，并有系统地有步骤地进行土地改革，使农民从封建压迫剥削下完全解放出来。这是目前全华东党具有头等重要意义的任务。因为只有使广大农民生活改善及农业生产提高，才能一方面扩大工业品所必需的市场，另方面供给城市更多粮食和工业原料。因为只有依靠广大国内市场及广大农村供给足够的粮食和原料，才能使上海及江南各城市真正走上健全和繁荣发展的轨道。
    （五）发展内地交通，鼓励城乡物资交流。帝国主义指使国民党残余势力以封锁办法来阻止和割断我内外交流的关系；为了粉碎敌人这种封锁阴谋，我们就必须迅速发展内地交通，鼓励内地物资交流，加强城乡互助，以发展和繁荣国内经济。
    （六）实行节衣缩食，克服目前困难。一切党政军民组织，必须厉行精简机关，紧缩编制，清理资财，建立制度，节省开支，反对浪费，提倡艰苦朴素作风，克服奢侈浮华的习气。特别是我党干部必须以自己的模范的行动和艰苦卓绝的精神，来影响和推动全上海和华东人民进行节衣缩食运动，来克服当前的困难。
    我们可以自豪地说，解放后的上海，尽管帝国主义与国民党残余势力如何进行其破坏扰乱和武装封锁，尽管敌人这些阴谋活动可能暂时给我们以若干困难，但我们决不因此而气馁。因为中国共产党和中国人民在其伟大的领袖和导师毛泽东同志领导下，曾经在长期的革命斗争中战胜过无数次的严重困难。例如二万五千里的长征及敌人在解放战争中的重点进攻，都曾经被人民解放军和中国人民所克服。何况上海现在所遇到的困难，不但具有显然不同的性质，而且处在国内外整个形势对我空前有利和全国范围的胜利和解放即将到来的时候。所以我们目前的困难，是胜利和发展中的困难，这正如抗日战争时期我们所遭遇并顺利克服敌人的封锁一样，其结果反将加强我们自力更生的决心，并建设各解放区繁荣经济的基础。因此，对目前敌人封锁困难表示任何悲观失望都是错误的。
    全上海的工人、学生、一切劳动群众和一切进步的产业界人士和一切爱国的民主人士们！紧急动员起来为粉碎敌人的封锁而斗争！为克服目前的困难及建设新上海而斗争！
