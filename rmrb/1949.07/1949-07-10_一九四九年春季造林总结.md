　　1949 Spring Afforestation Summary
    Forestry and Animal Husbandry Department, North China People's Government
    (1) Situation and Achievements:
    Since the Agricultural and Forestry Conference in January, various regions have made specific arrangements for afforestation work. Some regions have also convened meetings of professional cadres (such as the sandy area of ​​Western Hebei and Laishui) to organize afforestation and forest protection committees to specifically lead afforestation and forest protection. Methods such as issuing announcements, issuing forest ownership certificates (in Chahar, private individuals are issued forest ownership certificates for afforestation on public land), sending letters to encourage afforestation heroes (Jinan Administrative Office), and stipulating forest protection covenants were used, and publicity and education work was carried out. In order to solve the difficulty of tree seedlings, the masses in various regions have adopted methods such as organizing collective seedling purchases, exchanging firewood for seedlings, and cooperative afforestation through shares (such as tree planting groups, "Bozi Associations"). The government has also issued some loans and seed seedlings. Some areas (such as Yi County and Laishui) also carried out challenge and competition activities. After such organization and mobilization, the afforestation movement was launched in conjunction with urgent tasks such as supporting the front and expanding the army.
    Summarizing the afforestation work this spring, the leadership generally paid more attention, the organization and planning were relatively thorough, and the mobilization was relatively extensive, so the results were also relatively large. (See table below)
    Region　　Planned number of trees to be planted throughout the year in North China　　　Completed number　　　Percentage of completion
    Chahar　５,４３０,０００　９,５９９,１２１　１７６.９％
    Taiyue　３,３１０,０００　２９０,０００　８.７％
    Jinan　１,５３０,０００　２,０００,０００　１３０.７％
    Jizhong　３,０４０,０００　５,１３１,３３７　１６８.７９％
    Taihang　４,５００,０００　４,５６１,８６１　１０１.３％
    Ji-Lu-Yu　５,５４０,０００　２,１１３,６８１　３８.１％
    Taiyuan　１,２００,０００　２５４,７２８　２１.２％
    Jidong　６,９６５,６３７　３,８０５,８１２　５４.６％
    Total　３１,５１５,６３７　２７,７５６,５４０　Slightly over 88％
    Judging from the above incomplete figures, Chahar, Jizhong, Jinan, and Taihang have all exceeded the annual plan, especially Chahar and Jizhong, with Jinan and Taihang following closely behind.
    (2) Experiences and Problems to be Solved
    1. The masses need to plant trees and afforest. Especially in areas with frequent floods and wind and sand hazards, there is a more urgent need. For example, the masses in Yu Family Village, Yuanchao, Jinan, reflected: "If we don't plant trees, we can't protect the wheat," "To get rich, plant more trees," and "To prevent sand, cover the soil with branches." The masses in Xizheng Village, Xingtang, said: "If we don't plant trees, we won't even have food to eat in three years!" In the past, afforestation was mostly a general call, lacking specific leadership, so the results were not large enough. This year, the leadership generally went deeper and more specific, reflected in the purposeful and focused use of forces (such as the Jizhong Administrative Office sending 31 cadres to the ninth and tenth districts to specifically lead afforestation in sandy areas), being able to seize the season and the gaps in expanding the army and supporting the front to organize forces for a concentrated effort, solving specific difficulties (such as the lack of tree seedlings), and focusing on flood and wind and sand prevention as the key to afforestation. The afforestation movement in these key areas has driven other areas, which has played a significant role in this year's afforestation movement. However, some areas still have a bureaucratic style, taking an indifferent attitude towards the afforestation movement, only making general arrangements and calls, without specific and in-depth leadership, so the results are not significant.
    2. Only attention was paid to afforestation, and the cultivation of nurseries was neglected. No region completed the task, and most regions rarely mentioned this work in their summary reports, failing to realize that establishing nurseries is the most fundamental work for carrying out the North China afforestation movement.
    3. This year's afforestation task was relatively clear and specific in advance (with certain numbers), which played a certain role in overcoming the spontaneous nature of the work and strengthening the responsibility of cadres. However, some areas, due to not paying attention to studying the spirit of the instructions from higher levels, and without investigation and research, mechanically assigned tasks, forming coercion and commandism, hindering the masses' consciousness and enthusiasm for production, and producing a perfunctory attitude of only planting and not caring about survival. This style must be corrected in the future.
    4. Due to insufficient attention to forest protection work in the past, and some "leftist" deviations occurred during the land reform, the masses still have many concerns about large-scale afforestation, fearing that it cannot be protected and that they will not benefit (mainly on public land). The leaders in various regions carried out publicity and education targeting this ideology, and universally mobilized the masses to formulate forest protection covenants and organize forest protection committees. At the same time, the government also issued announcements and forest ownership certificates, guaranteeing that whoever plants the trees owns them and is not allowed to infringe upon them, which played a certain role in resolving the concerns of the masses. However, some areas are still very careless (such as Ji-Lu-Yu and Taiyuan). This issue should be given attention and persisted with, making it a regular task. And use strict laws and discipline to protect the production of the masses and overcome the state of anarchy in rural areas.
    5. To solve the difficulties of labor and tree seedlings, promoting cooperative afforestation is a successful experience. However, some have not agreed on the distribution method of income in a timely manner, so the masses reflect, "Don't look at the prosperity now, when the trees grow big, everyone will be envious, and problems will arise!" Therefore, they are not interested in forest protection. Various regions should promptly rectify this, clearly determine the income distribution, so as to consolidate the masses' afforestation and forest protection sentiment and prevent future disputes.
    6. Chahar Province and some areas of Jizhong convened "local expert meetings" in advance. Through the meetings, farmers with technical skills understood the policies and strengthened their confidence. At the same time, county and district cadres learned the technology, allowing technology and administration to be closely combined, and jointly went to the countryside to lead tree planting, which played a significant role in consolidating the masses' sentiment and ensuring survival.

　　一九四九年春季造林总结
    华北人民政府农业部林牧处
    （一）情况和成绩：
    自从一月份农林会议后，各地具体布置了造林工作，有的地区还召开了专业干部会（如冀西沙荒区和涞水）组织造林和护林委员会，专门领导造林和护林；并用出布告、发林木所有证（察哈尔规定私人在公地造林发给林木所有证），致函鼓励造林英雄（冀南行署），规定护林公约等方式，并进行了宣传教育工作。为解决树秧困难，各地群众都采取了组织起来集体购苗、用柴换苗、入股合作造林（如植树小组、“拨子会”）等办法，政府也发放了一部分贷款和种子树苗。部分地区（如易县与涞水）群众还进行挑战和竞赛运动。经过这样的组织和动员，于是造林运动即在结合支前、扩军等紧急任务下开展起来。
    总结今年春季造林工作，一般领导上比较注意，组织计划也比较周密，动员比较广泛，因而成绩也比较大。（如下表）
    区别　　全华北原计划全年植树数　　　完成数　　　完成百分比
    察哈尔　５，４３０，０００　９，５９９，１２１　１７６．９％
    太　岳　３，３１０，０００　２９０，０００　８．７％
    冀　南　１，５３０，０００　２，０００，０００　１３０．７％
    冀　中　３，０４０，０００　５，１３１，３３７　１６８．７９％
    太　行　４，５００，０００　４，５６１，８６１　１０１．３％
    冀鲁豫　５，５４０，０００　２，１１３，６８１　３８．１％
    太　原　１，２００，０００　２５４，７２８　２１．２％
    冀　东　６，９６５，６３７　３，８０５，８１２　５４．６％
    总　计　３１，５１５，６３７　２７，７５６，５４０　８８％强
    从上列不完全数字看，察哈尔、冀中、冀南、太行都超过全年计划，尤以察哈尔、冀中成绩最好，冀南、太行次之。
    （二）经验及应解决的问题
    一、群众需要植树造林。特别在洪水泛滥，风沙为害地区，更有迫切要求。如冀南元朝于家村群众反映：“要是不栽树，麦子保不住”、“要得富，多栽树”、“要防沙，把条压”。行唐西正村群众说：“不栽树，再等三年连饭也吃不开啦”！过去对植树造林多是一般的号召，缺乏具体领导，因之成绩不够大；今年一般领导上都比较深入具体，表现在使用力量上有目的，有重点（如冀中行署抽出三十一个干部赴九专、十专，专门领导沙荒造林），能抓紧季节、抓紧扩军、支前的空隙，组织力量突击，解决具体困难（如树秧缺乏），并以防洪、防风沙为植树造林重点，由这些重点地区的造林运动带动了其他地区，这对今年植树造林运动起了很大作用。不过，有的地区仍有官僚主义作风，对植树造林运动采取漠不关心的态度，只一般地布置号召，没作具体深入的领导，因之成绩不大。
    二、只注意造林，忽视了培植苗圃，各地区都没完成任务，大部地区在总结报告上很少谈这一工作，没认识到设立苗圃是开展华北造林运动的最基本的工作。
    三、今年植树造林任务，事先布置比较明确具体（有一定的数字），在克服工作中的自流现象及加强干部责任心方面，起了一定作用；但有些地区由于不注意研究上级指示的精神，未经调查研究，机械地分配任务，形成强迫命令，阻碍了群众对生产的自觉性和积极性，产生了管栽不管活的应付态度。这种作风，今后亟须纠正。
    四、由于过去对护林工作注意不够，土改时又发生过某些左的偏向，群众对大量造林的顾虑还很多，怕保不住，怕得不到利（主要是公地上）。各地领导上针对这种思想进行了宣传教育，并普遍的动员群众制订护林公约，组织护林委员会，同时政府也出布告，发林木所有证，保证了谁栽的树即是谁的，不准侵犯，对解决群众顾虑，起了一定的作用。但一部分地区还是很马虎（如冀鲁豫、太原），这一问题应引起注意，并坚持下去，使成为经常性的工作。并用严肃的法纪来保护群众的生产，克服农村中的无政府状态。
    五、为解决劳动力和树苗的困难，提倡合作造林，是成功的经验。但有的未及时约定收益的分配办法，因之群众反映“别看眼前红火，树大了大家眼就红了，问题就出来哪！”因之对护林不感兴趣，各地应及时予以清理，把收益分配明确的确定，以巩固群众造林和护林情绪，杜绝今后纠纷。
    六、察省和冀中部分地区，事先召集“土专家会议”，通过会议，使有技术的农民了解政策，坚定信心；同时又使县区干部学会了技术，让技术与行政密切结合，共同下乡领导植树，对巩固群众情绪和保证成活上都起了很大的作用。
