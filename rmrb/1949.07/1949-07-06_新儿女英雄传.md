　　The New Heroes and Heroines
    Chapter 17: The Fish Escapes the Net (Continued 2)

　　The moon rose. The moon, eighteen or nineteen days old, shone brightly. After chasing for a while with three fast boats, the group went up the embankment; they looked both ways, but there was no one. There was a house more than a hundred bow-lengths ahead, where the embankment watchers lived during floods; they ran over to take a look, but there was no one there either.

　　In this area, beyond the embankment, an arrow's distance away, was dry land, covered with dense reeds, and beyond that was water. Inside the embankment was all water. Niu Dashui looked at the terrain and discussed it with Gao Tun'er, saying, "We can't do this! If the enemy is hiding in the reeds and ambushes us, we're sure to get hit. How about this, let's walk along the inner slope of the embankment, searching as we advance." Gao Tun'er immediately sent out three scouts to investigate, and the group followed behind, running along the inner slope of the embankment.

　　Near Zhu Family Mouth, a scout came back to report: "A dead man has been found ahead!" Dashui asked, "Can you see who it is?" He said, "No." Dashui and Gao Tun'er ran over to take a look. On the embankment slope, the dead man was head down, feet up, with a newly shaved head, a wisp of black blood flowing straight down to the embankment root, and a hand grenade tightly clenched in his hand. Gao Tun'er said in surprise: "It's Little Boy! When was he killed? How come we didn't hear any gunshots?" Dashui said: "It must be that the sound of the boats was loud just now, and we didn't hear it." He bent down to touch him and hurriedly said: "His body is still warm. The enemy must not be far away, let's chase after them quickly!" Gao Tun'er told the three scouts ahead to be careful, and everyone chased forward again.

　　They hadn't run far when suddenly a password was asked in front. The three of them quickly climbed onto the embankment slope, and a volley of gunfire came over. The team members all wanted to lie down, but Gao Tun'er shouted: "What are you lying down for! Run quickly!" The group swished along the embankment to the slope and were parallel to the enemy on the outer slope, and the two sides fought across the embankment, but after fighting for a long time, neither side hit anyone.

　　Dashui thought to himself: "It's a pity we came in a hurry and didn't bring hand grenades. If we fight like this, there's no way to do anything even if we fight all night." He discussed it with Gao Tun'er, and Gao Tun'er led a squad, ran half a mile forward, searched across the embankment, and then encircled them back, and the two sides fought together. Gao Tun'er took a squad and ran off.

　　Gao Tun'er was anxious, and only ran two or three hundred bow-lengths before crossing the embankment; they started fighting dozens of bow-lengths away from the enemy. Taking advantage of the chaos, Dashui and the others rushed over the embankment and pinned down the enemy. They seized their weapons. Everyone was so excited, they hurriedly used leggings to tie up the fellows one by one.

　　Ma Danxiao and the other three had their guns confiscated by the enemy long ago, their hands were tied behind their backs, and they were all injured. When they saw their own people, Ma Danxiao stomped his feet crying and said: "Alas, alas, damn it! When we got to Zhu Family Mouth just now, there were a few boats there. He Shixiong, that bastard, told this group to run from the embankment, and he took his concubine and Guo Sanmazi and Zhang Jinlong, seven people in total, and escaped by boat!"

　　Chapter 18: An Encounter with the Enemy

　　Say I know him, ah,
　　I know him too:
　　He wears a pompadour,
　　And has gold teeth...
　　　　　　——Folksong

　　A single death solves all problems!
　　　　　　——Idiom

    I

　　The town was taken. In the courtyard of a large temple in the South Gate, several Japanese prisoners were squatting there with their heads shaved, barefoot, their clothes and trousers torn, their faces very dirty, all drooping their heads and not saying a word.

　　A small orderly brought them a basin of water for washing their faces, as well as soap, mirrors, and towels. The Japanese stood up, holding the mirror and looking this way and that. The black face, red mouth, yellow teeth and rolling eyes in the mirror were very comical; but they couldn't laugh, and they all kept their faces tight. After washing, the small orderly brought clothes and shoes for them to put on. They all said: "The Eighth Route Army is very good, thank you! Thank you!" The little Eighth Route Army led them into the house. The political director of the sub-district headquarters, Comrade Cheng Ping, the former county party secretary, talked to them very kindly.

　　The Japanese wrote on paper; speaking in broken Chinese. These were all from the seventh conscription, and had been away from home for four years. They said that when they first came to China, life was very good, but now everything was bad, and they couldn't even get enough to eat, and were only issued a small bowl for each meal. The soldiers served the officers, fetching water and food, and even washing their feet. They were often beaten and scolded, and were so miserable that they thought about home every day.

　　Cheng Ping asked them what family members they had, and they took out photos to show Cheng Ping. A businessman named Yamamoto said that his brother and brothers had all sacrificed in China, and he didn't know when he would be able to return home, and he sighed with tears in his eyes. A metalworker named Mita, who loved to talk the most, called himself an "activist" and said: "Our Taijun Okana knows." He drew a big circle on the paper: "Your China, very big!" Then he drew a small circle: "Our Japan, very small!" He also said: "Your big China, put our small Japan—" He hit his chest with his fist, closed his eyes, and leaned back, making Cheng Ping and the others laugh. Mita shook his hand and said: "No, no, defeated, defeated!" They indicated that they had not fired a single shot this time.

　　Cheng Ping explained to the prisoners that the Chinese and Japanese people should join hands to overthrow Japanese imperialism, and they all nodded. Mita proposed that he would like to go to the Japanese Anti-War League. Others were also willing; only Yamamoto was afraid that he would not be able to return home, and asked to be sent back to the city.

　　Among these Japanese, there was a tall farmer who always pursed his thick lips and did not speak. When asked what he wanted, he looked at Mita and said he was willing to go with Mita. Suddenly, the Japanese farmer's face changed, and he stood up, looking at Niu Dashui who was walking in. Dashui also recognized him. This Japanese soldier was the "Chuichi Kasaburo" who caught him during the great mopping-up operation.

　　Dashui grinned and smiled, gesticulating and asking him: "Do you remember: you twisted my ears and wrestled with me like this?" That "Chuichi Kasaburo" stared with frightened eyes and slowly retreated. Dashui said with a smile: "Don't be afraid! Our Eighth Route Army treats prisoners well. You hit me back then, but I won't hit you now." That Japanese person saluted Dashui like a Chinese person. Dashui pulled his hand embarrassedly and said with a smile: "Don't do that! Now that you've come over, we brothers are all one family, only the Japanese warlords are our enemies."

　　Dashui turned around and told Cheng Ping that the coffins found for the dead puppet soldiers and Japanese were all ready. Cheng Ping smiled and said to the prisoners: "All of you who are injured have been sent to the hospital. Coffins have been prepared for the dead, and they will be sent back to the city. Do you have any opinions?" They all stood up together and bowed deeply. Mita said that every Japanese soldier wore a copper tag with a number on it, and that they should not be lost, otherwise they would not know who they were. Cheng Ping readily agreed.

　　We treated the prisoners to pork and white flour. Yamamoto was always sighing and couldn't eat. After the meal, Mita and the others were sent to the branch of the Japanese Anti-War League in the military region. At dusk, the district squad sent Yamamoto to the outskirts of the city, and let him return. He walked back and forth on the embankment, weeping constantly, and finally, suddenly jumped into the river and committed suicide.

    II

　　He Shixiong, Zhang Jinlong and his gang fled into the city.

　　In the hot weather, Yang Xiaomei volunteered to develop work in the town. She first heard that the puppet captain on the watchtower there was Guo Sanmazi, and a squad leader under him was Cui Chiluk, and the two of them were bullying a woman. The woman's name was Li Lannu, and her family was from Huanghua Village; she had participated in the Women's Rescue Association when she was a girl, and Xiaomei knew her, so she wanted to use her relationship to carry out work. She also heard that Zhang Jinlong often went to Guo Sanmazi's place, and thought in her heart that it would be best to catch this guy as well.

　　At that time, the comrades in the county agreed to her going, because Xiaomei had a good way of opening up areas in the past, but they repeatedly told her to be careful. Xiaomei had a lot of confidence in this work. The child, Xiao Pang, was five months old and still breastfeeding, so she brought him with her. At dusk, she hid the pistol on her body, wearing a loose floral jacket and wide-legged floral trousers, looking like a rustic old folk visiting relatives; carrying Xiao Pang, she was led by an acquaintance, and mixed near the town, and lived in Chen Da Niang's house, the mother of Sister Chen.

　　Chen Da Niang, a relative of the martyr, was a warm-hearted person and had a good understanding of the revolution. She was also related to Li Lannu. Xiaomei first sent Da Niang to chat with Lannu, slowly sounding her out. Da Niang came back and told Xiaomei everything that Lannu said, word for word. Xiaomei listened and pondered in her heart. After Da Niang went twice, Xiaomei made up her mind and discussed with Da Niang: "Call Lannu here to meet her, do you think it's a problem?" Da Niang said: "It's okay! She's my niece, she won't spoil our affairs whether or not they succeed." In the evening, she called Lannu over.

　　Li Lannu was stunned when she saw Yang Xiaomei, and blurted out: "Oh my! Isn't this our director! How did you get here?" Xiaomei smiled and pulled her to sit on the kang, deliberately chatting with her; asking how she found a husband's family, and how she was doing now.

　　This question stirred up Lannu's sad affairs. She talked about how the Japanese burned her house during the May 1st mopping-up, forcing her family to live in a melon shed and beg for food. Her father had no choice but to find her a husband; the man was ten years older than her, but he was a good and honest man. Who knew that just two months after she got married, the man was conscripted by the Japanese soldiers and died outside. Leaving her alone, she sold the table and sold the cabinet, and ate everything she sold... When she got to the sad part, tears streamed down her face, and she cried until her eyes were red.

　　Xiaomei told her that it was all caused by the Japanese, wasn't it? If the Japanese weren't driven out of China, there would be no good days; and encouraged her: "You used to be very active in anti-Japanese work, whether it was digging ditches, breaking roads, sewing military uniforms, or making military shoes, you never fell behind. You can't abandon your glorious history and compromise like this!"

　　Lannu said: "Alas! I also think that I'm not looking like myself now, but what can I do? Since the May 1st mopping-up operation, I've come here and haven't seen our people again. In my heart, I only say that the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are good, but they can't beat the Japanese devils. Our people can only stare and suffer. Later, I heard that the Eighth Route Army had also taken the town, and my heart was a little brighter."

　　Xiaomei told Lannu about the recent victory news and the political situation. She also advised her: "If you are mixed up with these traitors, whether you are with this one or that one, what will become of you in the future?" Lannu sighed and said embarrassedly: "They often come to me, and they even compete for my affection and quarrel, putting me in the middle, which is also embarrassing. I don't dare to offend them, but what can I do?"

　　Xiaomei asked about the situation of Cui Chiluk and Guo Sanmazi, and gave Lannu an idea. After talking and talking, Lannu agreed, and she didn't go home until very late.

    III

　　Guo Sanmazi and Zhang Jinlong had that "one-gun feud" in the past, but later He Shixiong reconciled them, saying that they were all one family, and there was no need to make trouble over women, and they became friends again. Now Zhang Jinlong is the plainclothes captain in the city, and he is very popular both in front of the Japanese and in front of He Shixiong. Guo Sanmazi instead clung to him, and the two became drinking buddies again.

　　One afternoon, Zhang Jinlong brought a jar with a toad in it to find Guo Sanmazi. The two of them discussed trying to cheat money by changing the way the toad looked. Cui Chiluk took this opportunity to slip to Li Lannu's house to play. On the way, he sang the little tune of "Jasmine Flower," deliberately changing the jasmine flower to a little orchid flower:

　　Such a beautiful little orchid flower!
　　Such a beautiful little orchid flower!
　　The flowers in the whole garden
　　Can't compare to her!
　　I want to pick a fresh flower to wear on my head,
　　But I'm afraid the flower seller will scold me!...

　　He walked into Lannu's house. Lannu was lying on the kang, facing inward, without moving at all. Cui Chiluk pushed her, but she didn't say a word. Anxious, Cui Chiluk scratched his ears and cheeks and said: "Where did I offend you? You're ignoring me like this!" Lannu turned over and sat up, crying and saying: "Lao Cui, don't blame me. Your captain said that if I keep you, he will beat me to death if he finds out! Just take pity on me and leave quickly!"

　　Cui Chiluk said angrily: "I'll fuck his grandmother! What is Sanmazi? How dare he be so forceful! What's it to him if we two are good!" Lannu wiped her tears and said: "Yes! I'm also a woman from a good family, not a broken shoe, not a brothel he's rented. Whoever I want to be with is who I want to be with. Is it his business?"

　　Cui Chiluk pulled Lannu and said: "Who do you want to be with in the end?" Lannu pursed her lips and said: "Hmph! Him, with such a pockmarked face, I wouldn't look at him in eight lifetimes!" Cui Chiluk said with a flattering face: "What about me?" Lannu glanced at him sideways and said: "You, I'm afraid you are a boneless umbrella, and you can't hold it up. In the future, it will flash me and I will have no ending, so I might as well give up early!" Cui Chiluk hugged her and said: "Giving up is not possible, isn't that going to kill me!" Lannu laughed and pointed at his forehead with her finger and said: "It won't kill you, but it will kill me!"

　　Cui Chiluk was so happy that he couldn't open his eyes and said: "My darling, as long as you are good to me, I will do whatever you say!" Lannu pushed him away and said: "If you want to listen to me, you should connect with the Eighth Route Army, kill Sanmazi, and surrender to their side. It's not in vain that you are a Chinese. The two of us can be a long-term couple. If you don't dare to do it, then don't ever step on my threshold again! My life and death have nothing to do with you, and we will break up from now on!" Cui Chiluk said anxiously: "Don't do that! I've long figured out that the Japanese can't eat this meal for long. But, where can we find this lead?" Lannu stared at him closely and said: "That's easy to say; are you really sincere or are you fooling me? Take an oath!" Cui Chiluk stamped his feet and said: "Why are you like this! ... There is heaven above, earth below, and conscience in the middle; if I am half-hearted, let me be shot!"

　　After the two of them had discussed it, Li Lannu led Cui Chiluk to meet Yang Xiaomei. Cui Chiluk's face was full of shame, and he said with his head down: "Comrade Yang, I have done shameful things in the past few years, and I also feel that I am embarrassed to see you. If the Eighth Route Army can be lenient with me, I am still willing to return to our side."

　　Yang Xiaomei said: "Your surrender to the enemy and doing bad things is no small crime; however, if you repent and contribute more to the anti-Japanese war in the future, the Eighth Route Army is still willing to save you." Then, she told him about the victorious situation of the anti-Japanese war.

　　After listening, Cui Chiluk shook his head and said: "The Eighth Route Army's affairs are getting more and more prosperous, much more powerful than when I was there before! I can see that being a traitor is not something a human can do. These days, I can't even get enough to eat, and I'm wearing this chicken-like clothes that I haven't changed in two years. Damn it, Guo Sanmazi, that dog bastard, steps on people under his feet. I can't wait to bite him to death. As long as the Eighth Route Army helps me, it's not me bragging, but I can do anything!"

　　Xiaomei asked about the situation on the watchtower and taught him to first contact people below, prepare almost everything, and then agree on a time to start, and the Eighth Route Army would send troops to meet them. Xiaomei also settled with Cui Chiluk: "I heard that Zhang Jinlong often comes to your place, if there is a chance, catch this die-hard traitor together, that would be even better. Anyway, watching the fish fall into the net, you can watch and do it!" (To be continued)

　　新儿女英雄传
    第十七回　鱼儿漏网了（续二）
    月亮上来了。十八九的月亮照得挺明快。三只快船追了一阵，一伙人就上了堤；两头一望，都没有人。前面一百多弓远有个房子，是涨水的时候看堤人住的；跑过去一看，也没有人。
    这一带，堤外边一箭远是干地，长满了密密丛丛的苇子，再往外就是水。堤里边尽是水。牛大水一看这地形，就和高屯儿商量说：“咱们这么着不行！要是敌人藏在苇地里，打咱们的伏击，准挨。这么着吧，咱们沿堤的里坡走，搜索前进。”高屯儿马上派出三个尖兵在前面侦查，一伙人在后面跟着，沿堤的里坡跑过去。
    到了朱家口附近，一个尖兵回来报告：“前面发现一个死人！”大水问：“看清是什么人？”说：“没有。”大水就和高屯儿跑去看。堤坡上，那死人头冲下，脚朝上，新剃的头，头上一缕黑血直流到堤根，手里还紧紧的攒着个手榴弹。高屯儿吃惊的说：“是小小子！多会儿打死的？怎么没听见枪声呢？”大水说：“准是刚才划船的声音大，没听见。”他弯下腰去摸，忙说：“身上边热呢。敌人一定不远，咱们快追！”高屯儿叫头里三个尖兵注意，大家又往前追。
    跑了不远，突然前面问口令。三个人赶快往堤坡一爬，一个排子枪就打过来了。队员都想爬下，高屯儿喝着：“爬什么！赶快跑！”大伙儿唰的一下沿堤往坡跑过去，就跟堤外坡的敌人平行了，两方面隔着堤打起来，可是打了半天，谁也打不着谁。
    大水心里琢磨：“可惜来得忙，没拿手榴弹，这样打，打一夜也没有办法。”就和高屯儿商量，由高屯儿带一个班，往前跑半里地，搜索过堤，再往回包抄他，两方面一块儿打。高屯儿拉上一个班就跑去了。
    高屯儿心里着急，只跑了二三百弓，就过了堤；离敌人几十弓就打上了。趁一股乱劲儿，大水他们哗的超过堤，一下把敌人都按住了。夺下武器。大家兴奋得要命，忙用绑腿布把那些家伙一个个捆起来。
    马胆小三个，带的枪早给敌人缴了，手反绑着，都带了伤。一见自己人，马胆小哭着跺脚说：“唉，唉，她妈的！刚才到了朱家口，那儿有几只船。何世雄这个王八蛋，叫这一伙子从堤上跑，他带着小婆，和郭三麻子张金龙七个人坐船逃了！”
    第十八回　冤家路窄
    说我认得他啊，
    我也认得他：
    留着背头，
    镶着金牙……
    　　　　　　——民歌
    一死无大难！
    　　　　　　——成语
    一
    市镇拿下了。南关一个大庙的院子里，几个日本俘虏光着头，赤着脚，衣裳裤子都扯破了，脸儿很脏，一个个蹲在那里，搭拉着脑袋不言语。
    有个小勤务员给他们端来一盆洗脸水，还拿来胰子镜子手巾儿。日本人站起来，拿着镜子这么照，那么照。镜子里的黑脸，红嘴黄牙翻白眼，很滑稽；他们可笑不出，都紧绷着脸儿。洗完以后，小勤务员又拿来衣服和鞋子，给他们穿上。他们都说：“八路大大的好，谢谢！谢谢！”小八路把他们领进屋子里。分区司令部的政治主任，就是以前的县委书记程平同志，很和气的跟他们谈话。
    日本人在纸上写；说着半通不通的中国话。这几个都是第七次征兵出来的，离家已经四年了。他们说，刚来中国的时候生活很好，现在什么都不行了，连饭也吃不饱，每顿只发一小碗。当兵的伺候当官的，打水打饭，还打洗脚水，常挨打挨训，苦得不成，天天想家。
    程平问他们家里有些什么人，他们掏出照片来指给程平看。有个叫山本的商人，说他哥哥和兄弟都在中国牺牲了，不知道什么时候才能回国，说着眼泪汪汪的长出气。有个五金工人叫米田，最爱说话，他自称是“活动分子”，说：“我们的太君冈野进的知道。”他在纸上画了个大圈儿：“你们中国，大大的！”又画个小圈儿：“我们日本，小小的！”又说：“你们大大的中国，把我们小小的日本——”他用拳头打一下胸膛，眼睛一闭，身子一仰，逗得程平他们都笑起来。米田摇着手说：“不行不行，败了败了的！”他们表示这一回都没有打枪。
    程平向俘虏们解释，中日人民应该拉起手来，打倒日本帝国主义，他们都点头。米田提出，愿意到日本反战同盟去。旁的人也都愿意；只有山本怕回不了国，要求把他送回城里去。
    这些日本人里面，有一个高个儿农民，老噘着厚厚的嘴唇，不说话。问他愿意怎么样，他看看米田，说愿意跟米田走。突然，这日本农民的脸色变了，站起来，望着走进来的牛大水。大水也认出来，这个日本兵，就是大扫荡时候抓他的那个“初一加三郎”。
    大水咧着嘴儿笑了，比划着问他：“你记得不记得：你拧我的耳朵，跟我这么摔跤？”那“初一加三郎”害怕的瞪着两个眼儿，慢慢往后退。大水笑呵呵的说：“别害怕！我们八路军优待俘虏。那会儿你打我，现在我可不打你。”那日本人学中国人的样儿，给大水作了个揖。大水不好意思的拉住他的手，笑着说：“别那样！你们过来了，咱弟兄都是一家子，只有日本军阀才是咱们的敌人。”
    大水转身告诉程平，给死亡的伪军和日本人找的棺材都齐备了。程平笑着对俘虏们说：“所有你们受伤的都送医院了。死的准备装了棺材，送回城里去，你们有什么意见？”他们一齐站起来，深深的鞠躬。米田说，每一个日本兵身上都挂一块铜牌，铜牌上都有号码，千万不要丢掉，丢了就不知道是谁了。程平一口答应。
    咱们请俘虏吃猪肉白面。那山本可老是唉声叹气，吃不下饭。饭后，米田他们送到军区日本反战同盟支部去了。傍黑了，区小队把山本送到城郊，让他回去。他在堤上走来走去，不住的啼哭，最后，突然跳下河，自杀了。
    二
    何世雄张金龙一伙人，逃到城里去了。
    大热天，杨小梅自告奋勇，到城关去开辟工作。她先听说，那儿岗楼上，伪队长是郭三麻子，手下有个班长就是崔磆碌，他两个欺负着一个女人。那女人名叫李兰女，娘家是黄花村的；当闺女的时候参加过妇救会，小梅认识她，就想利用她的关系，进行工作。她又听说，张金龙也常到郭三麻子那儿去，心里想，最好把这家伙也弄住。
    当时县上的同志，因为小梅过去开辟地区很有办法，也就同意她去了，只是一再嘱咐她小心。小梅对这工作，可挺有信心。孩子小胖五个月了，还吃奶，就带在身边。黄昏时分，她把小手枪藏在身上，穿着肥肥大大的花挂子，下面是宽腿儿花裤子，土里土气的，装着串亲戚的老百姓；抱了小胖，由一个熟人领路，混到城关附近，就住在陈大姐的母亲陈大娘家里。
    抗属陈大娘是个热心肠人，对革命挺有认识。她和李兰女又是亲戚。小梅先打发大娘去和兰女聊闲天，慢慢儿探她的口气。大娘回来，就把兰女说的什么话，一句一句的摆列给小梅听。小梅一面听，一面心里琢磨。大娘去了两回，小梅就拿定了主意，跟大娘商量：“把兰女叫到这儿来，和她见见面，你看碍事不碍事？”大娘说：“行喽！她是我的亲外甥女儿，事情成不成，她总不会坏咱们的。”晚上，她就把兰女叫来了。
    李兰女一见杨小梅就楞住了，脱口说：“我奶！这不是我们主任啊！怎么你到这儿来了呀？”小梅笑着拉她坐在炕上，故意跟她说家常话儿；问她怎么寻的婆家，这会儿过得怎么样。
    这一问，可把兰女的伤心事儿勾起来了。她絮絮叨叨的说起五一扫荡的时候，鬼子怎么烧了她家的房，逼得她一家子住在瓜棚里，要饭吃。她爹没办法，才给她寻了个主；男人比她大十岁，人倒是好人，挺老实。谁知过门刚两个月，男人就给鬼子抓兵抓走，死在外面了。剩下她一个，卖了桌子卖柜，什么都卖的吃光啦……她说到伤心的地方，一把眼泪一把鼻涕，哭的眼都红了。
    小梅就跟她说，这还不是鬼子害的啊？不把鬼子赶出中国去，多会儿也过不了好日子；又鼓励她：“你以前干抗日工作可积极啦，不管是挖沟破路，缝军衣做军鞋，哪一回你也没落过后，你可不能丢下过去的光荣历史，就这么妥协啊！”
    兰女说：“唉！我也瞧着我这会儿太不是个样儿，可有什么法子呢？从五一扫荡以后来到这边，再没见到咱们的人，我心里只说共产党八路军好是好，就是打不过日本鬼子，咱们老百姓只好干瞪着眼儿受气吧。后来听说市镇也给八路军拿下了，我心里才豁亮点儿。”
    小梅就把最近的胜利消息和政治形势，讲给兰女听。又劝她：“你和这些汉奸们混在一块儿，跟这个也好，跟那个也好，你将来可怎么个了呀？”兰女叹了一口气，不好意思的说：“他们老到我这儿来，还争风吃醋，吵嘴闹架，把我夹在当间，也是作蹩子。我又不敢得罪他们，可有什么办法呀？”
    小梅问了问崔磆碌和郭三麻子的情形，就给兰女出了个主意。说来说去，兰女同意了，很晚她才回家。
    三
    郭三麻子和张金龙，过去有那“一枪之仇”，后来何世雄给他们调解，说，都是一家人，不必在娘们身上闹蹩扭，他们又和好了。这会儿张金龙在城里当便衣队长，不论在日本人面前，或是在何世雄面前，都很吃香，郭三麻子反倒趋附他，两个人又成了酒肉朋友。
    这天后晌，张金龙带了个罐儿，里面装了个蛤蟆，来找郭三麻子。两个人商量着，想把蛤蟆变个法儿去骗钱。崔磆碌瞅这个空子，就溜到李兰女家来玩。路上他唱着“茉莉花”的小调，故意把茉莉花改成小兰花了：
    好一朵小兰花！
    好一朵小兰花！
    满园里那个花儿
    全都比不过她！
    我有心摘朵鲜花头上戴哟，
    又恐怕卖花的人儿骂！……
    他走进兰女屋里。兰女脸朝里躺在炕上，一动也不动。崔磆碌推她，她也不言语。急得崔磆碌抓耳搔腮的说：“我哪儿得罪你啦？你这么不搭理我！”兰女翻身坐起来，哭着说：“老崔，你别怨我。你们队长说的，我要留下你，给他知道了，非揍死我不行！你就只当可怜我，赶快走吧！”
    崔磆碌气愤愤的说：“我操他姥姥！三麻子是个什么东西，他敢这么强行霸道！咱两个好，碍他什么事儿！”兰女擦着泪说：“是啊！我也是好人家妇女，又不是破鞋，又不是他包的窑子，我愿意跟谁好就跟谁好，他管的着呀？”
    崔磆碌拉着兰女说：“你到底愿意跟谁好呀？”兰女把嘴撇得个瓢儿似的，说：“哼！他啊，那么个麻脸儿，我八辈子也看不上！”崔磆碌涎着脸儿说：“我呢？”兰女斜眼瞟着他说：“你呀，我就怕你是一个没骨头的伞，支撑不开。将来闪得我没下场，倒不如趁早拉倒呢！”崔磆碌搂着他说：“拉倒可不成，不是要我的命啦！”兰女嗤的一笑，用手指头点着他的额颅说：“要不了你的命，可要我的命呢！”
    崔磆碌喜的睁不开眼儿了，说：“我的宝贝儿，只要你跟我好，你说什么我都依你！”兰女推开他说：“要依着我，你跟八路军接个头儿，把三麻子打死，投到那边去，也不枉你是个中国人。咱们俩就可作长远夫妻了。你要不敢下手，你就永远别登我的门坎儿！我死我活不与你相干，咱俩就从这会儿分手！”崔磆碌着急说：“你别那么着！我早就盘算日本人这碗饭吃不长了。可是，咱们往哪儿找这个线头呢？”兰女紧盯着他说：“那倒好说；你到底是真心实意还是哄我呢？你起个誓！”崔磆碌跺脚说：“怎么你这个人！……上有天，下有地，中间有良心；我要是三心二意，叫我挨枪子儿！”
    两个人商量好了，李兰女就引崔磆碌来见杨小梅。崔磆碌满脸惭愧，垂着头儿说：“杨同志，我这几年作了丢人的事，自个儿也觉得怪没脸见你们的。要是八路军能宽大我，我还愿意回到咱们这边来。”
    杨小梅说：“你投降敌人干坏事儿，罪恶可不小；不过，你要是回心改过，以后给抗日多出些力，八路军还愿意挽救你。”接着，又把抗战胜利的形势说给他听。
    崔磆碌听了，摇头晃脑的说：“八路军的世事越闹越旺，比早先我在的工夫可厉害多啦！我就看出来当汉奸不是人干的，这会儿连饭也吃不饱，穿着这么一身鸡巴衣裳，两年也不换了。他妈的，郭三麻子这个狗杂种，把人踩在脚底下，我恨不得咬死他。只要八路军给我助劲儿，不是我吹牛，要怎么都能办到！”
    小梅问明白了岗楼上的情形，就教给他先在下面联络人，准备得差不多了，再约定时间动手，八路军派队伍来接应。小梅又安顿给崔磆碌：“听说张金龙常到你们这儿来，要是有机会，把这个铁杆汉奸一块儿抓住，那就更好了。反正看着鱼儿下罩，你瞧着办吧！”　（未完）
