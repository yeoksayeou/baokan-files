　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd. Since the rapid restoration of Shanghai's rail and shipping, significant achievements have been made in water and land transportation. Since the complete opening of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway on May 27, the day of Shanghai's liberation, passenger traffic has gradually increased month by month. Now, the number of passenger and freight trains operating daily has increased to more than 60. Due to the repair of the Huaihe River Railway Bridge on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, a trial run of a direct train from Shanghai to Beiping was also launched on July 1st. After the completion of the emergency repair of Bridge No. 2 near the West Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, joint barge transportation was started between Songjiang and Fengjing on June 7, and traffic with Hangzhou began. The Songhu branch line was restored on May 29. As of June 20, the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways had carried more than 167,400 passengers and traveled more than 208,000 kilometers. As of June 13, freight transport had reached more than 1,492,300 tons. In terms of shipping, with the concerted efforts of the takeover personnel and the vast number of employees, and with the assistance of the shipping industry, shipping routes from Shanghai to Wuhan, Tianjin, Qingdao, Lianyungang, and other ports have been restored successively. As of June 25, in addition to the 205 publicly owned ships that have resumed operations, there were 412 privately owned ships. Among them, the publicly owned ships taken over have transported a total of 3,373 passengers and 37,094 tons of cargo, not including military transport. Due to the rapid recovery of rail and shipping, the flow of materials between Shanghai and various ports in China has gradually been connected, which has played a significant role in restoring Shanghai's industrial production and stabilizing people's livelihoods.

　　上海车运航运畅通国内各埠
    【新华社上海三日电】上海车运航运迅速恢复后，水陆运输已获显著成绩。京沪铁路自五月二十七日上海解放当日全线通车后，月来客运逐次增加，现每日开行客货运列车已增至六十余列。由于津浦路淮河大铁桥修复，沪平直达试车列车亦已于七月一日开出。沪杭铁路于西站附近二号桥抢修完成后，六月七日起即于松江枫泾间用驳轮联运，开始与杭州通车。淞沪支线于五月二十九日即恢复。截至六月二十日止，京沪、沪杭两路载运旅客达十六万七千四百余人，驶行二十万八千余公里。货运截至六月十三日统计已达一百四十九万二千三百余吨。航运方面，在接管人员与广大员工一致努力及航业界的协助之下，上海至武汉、天津、青岛、连云港等航线，均已先后恢复。截至六月二十五日止，复航船只除公营的二零五艘外，私营船只达四一二艘。其中接管的公营船只已共运送旅客三三七三人、货物三七零九四吨，军运尚未统计在内。由于车运和航运的迅速恢复，上海与国内各埠间物资吞吐逐渐沟通，对恢复上海工业生产及安定民生作用极大。
