    [This Newspaper Reported] Anthrax Discovered in Chenliangying, Anci, Jizhong. The Health Department and Agriculture Department of the North China People's Government each dispatched medical prevention teams, carrying large quantities of vaccine serum and medical equipment, and departed on the 3rd to rush to the affected area for treatment. The course of the disease was that Wang Zhenheng, a resident of the village, bought a dead mule with anthrax, skinned it to make leather ropes, and as a result, the whole family was infected with anthrax. Wang and his eldest son died due to delayed treatment. The second son and nephew have come to Ping for treatment. A hired hand in his family was also infected with the disease, and Mao Guangzhi, who stayed at Wang's house for one night, also contracted it. The patient's affected area has a small black spot in the center, surrounded by small white blisters connected in a ring. The affected area is not painful, but the whole body is painful, sometimes cold and sometimes hot, with nausea and swollen lymph glands. After a confirmed diagnosis, each person was injected with 50 cc of serum, and the affected area was coated with sulfa powder. The next day, they greatly improved. In order to prevent the spread of the disease, the team universally implemented quarantine and preventive injections in the surrounding villages, injecting a total of more than 830 head of livestock, treating one sick animal, and dozens of ordinary patients. Anthrax mainly infects livestock, and humans are mostly infected by contact with sick animals or eating meat from sick animals. The disease develops one to three days after infection, and the severely ill die in five days. Therefore, sick animals should be burned, because anthrax bacteria will survive for a long time even if buried, and will still be infectious. If sick animals are found, a large amount of serum can be injected (usually 200 cc each time), and healthy animals should also be given vaccine preventive injections.

　　安次发现炭疽病
  　华北人民政府派员往治
    【本报讯】冀中安次陈亮营发现炭疽病，华北人民政府卫生部、农业部，各派医防队员，携带大批菌苗血清及医疗药械，于三日出发，驰赴发病地区救治。此病发生经过是该村住户王振恒，买了一头得炭疽病死的骡子，剥皮做皮绳，结果一家都传染了炭疽。王与其长子因救治过迟而死。次子、外甥已来平治疗。在他家一个帮活的也染此病，毛广之在王家住了一宿，也染上了。病者患处中心有小黑点，周围小白水泡接连成环，患处不痛，但周身疼痛，时冷时热，恶心，淋巴腺肿胀。经诊断确实后，每人注射了五十西西血清，患处涂了磺＠粉。次日即大愈。为了防止此病蔓延，该队在周围各村，普遍实施检疫及预防注射，共注射牲畜八百三十余头，治疗病畜一头，普通患者数十人。按炭疽主要传染牲畜，人多半由接触病畜或吃病畜肉而感染，感染后一至三天病发，重者五天即死，故病畜应烧掉，因埋掉炭疽菌也会生存很久，仍会传染。发现病畜可注射大量血清（平常每次二百西西），健畜亦应紧施菌苗预防注射。
