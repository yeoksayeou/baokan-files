　　Dali Village Ammunition Depot Explosion Incident
  　Those Responsible Punished
    [This newspaper reported] The waste ammunition depot of the former Jizhong Ordnance Management Office in Dali Village, Shen County, experienced an explosion in mid-June of last year, resulting in serious loss of life and property. At that time, the office was in the process of handing over operations to the repair factory of the former Jizhong Military Region Logistics Department. Material clerk Wang Ning, under the instruction of Section Chief Zheng Tao of the Management Section, was handling the matter in the village. One day in mid-June, without consulting his superiors, Wang Ning defied the orders of escort Zhang Dabang and, together with communication man Wang Shufen, privately opened the warehouse door and stole black explosives (Wang Ning did not personally go to the warehouse at the time because he was taking care of his wife, but instructed Zhang Dabang to supervise the loading and transportation). During the loading onto a truck, a group of local children climbed onto the vehicle to play and entered the warehouse courtyard. While Wang and others were moving the explosives, a sudden explosion occurred, immediately killing the driver, Lao Yan, Zhang Dabang, Wang Shufen, and seven children from the village, seriously injuring twelve others, destroying fifteen houses, over a thousand shells of mountain guns, over a thousand kilograms of yellow explosives, over a thousand kilograms of black explosives, a number of landmines and bullets, and some scrap iron. After the incident, the office immediately coordinated with the Jizhong Administrative Office and the Logistics Department of the Military Region to allocate funds to provide condolences and compensation to the families of the deceased and injured, and to inspect and dispose of dangerous waste materials and formulate warehouse management regulations (the office usually had lax management of warehouses, especially waste warehouses, with no guard system, disorganized storage, anyone could enter and exit the warehouse, and non-managers could also supervise transportation, for which the leadership, especially the Management Section directly leading the warehouse, should be held responsible). After receiving the report, the North China People's Government, on June 30th, instructed the Public Enterprises Department to take the following decisions on the relevant responsible personnel in this case: (1) Since the warehouse had already been decided to be handed over to the repair factory of the Logistics Department of the Jizhong Military Region, the material clerk Wang Ning, who was responsible for handling the handover, privately opened the warehouse door and stole black explosives, which was already illegal; moreover, the explosion during the loading and transportation resulted in nineteen deaths and injuries, causing a tragic disaster, he should bear the main responsibility for the accident and should be dismissed from his post and investigated to serve as a warning to others. (2) Before the accident, Wang Ning had already stolen explosives once, and his Management Section Chief Zheng Tao neither stopped nor punished him, indulging his recklessness and leading to this major disaster. He should bear serious responsibility and should be severely investigated and punished. The department is ordered to send Wang Ning and Zheng Tao to the court for legal action. This matter must be handled strictly and not perfunctorily. (3) In terms of leadership, the No. 55 Factory failed to recognize and deal with Wang Ning's criminal behavior in a timely manner regarding this major case involving the loss of seven lives and a large amount of people's property, nor did it seriously launch a discussion among the masses for education. Beforehand, it neither seriously studied and implemented the "Circular on the Hetoucun Warehouse Explosion Incident" and the "Warehouse Guard and Storage Regulations" issued by the Enterprise Department, nor did it improve the guard and storage system. To this day, some branch factories still have lax management of warehouses. This lack of organization and discipline and bureaucratic style, and irresponsible negligence towards the people's property, warrants the factory director Guo Li to be given a major demerit and circulated throughout the region for education.

　　大李村弹药库爆炸事件
  　当事人受处分
    【本报讯】原冀中兵工管理处在深县大李村之废品弹药库，于去年六月中旬发生爆炸，造成生命财产之严重损失。当时该处正向原属冀中区后勤部修造厂办理移交，由材料员王宁奉经管科长郑涛之命在该村办理其事。六月中旬某日，王宁不请示上级，拒命押运员张大邦偕通讯员王树芬私开库门，偷运黑色炸药（王宁当时因照料其妻，未亲到库房，嘱张大邦照管装运），在装车时，一群本村小孩爬汽车玩，随入库院，王等正搬运之际，猛然震响，发生爆炸，当即炸死司机老阎、张大邦、王树芬及该村小孩共七人，重伤十二人，毁房十五间，山炮弹壳千余发，黄色炸药千余斤，黑色炸药千余斤，地雷及子弹一部，与若干铁料等废物。事件发生后，该处当即协同冀中行署、军区后勤部拨款对死伤及受损失家属抚恤赔偿，并进行检查，处理废品危险物，制定仓库管理制度（按该处平日对库房尤其废品库管理不严，无看管制度，存品杂乱无章，任何人均可出入库房，非经管人亦可主持搬运，这点，领导上尤其直接领导库房的经管科应当负责）。华北人民政府据报后，于六月三十日令公营企业部对此案有关负责人员，决定如下处分：（一）该仓库既已决定移交冀中军区后勤部修造厂，而负责办理移交之材料员王宁，私开库门，偷运黑色炸药，已属非法；又在装运中致起爆炸，死伤十九人，造成惨痛巨灾，应负肇祸之主要责任，即应撤职查办，以儆效尤。（二）在出事前，王宁已偷运一次，其经管科长郑涛，既未制止，又未惩处，纵容放肆，酿此巨灾，应负严重责任，当严加追究，予以处分。着由该部即将王宁、郑涛解送法院法办，此事必须严办，不能马虎了事。（三）五十五大厂在领导上，对此七条人命及巨额人民资财损失之重大案件，对王宁此种罪恶行为，未能及时认识处理，更未郑重的在群众中展开讨论，以资教育，事前对企业部颁发之“河头村库房爆炸事件通令”与“库房警卫保管守则”既不认真研究执行，也未改善警卫保管制度，迄今有些分厂仓库仍存在着管理不严格现象，这种无组织无纪律及官僚主义作风，对人民财产不负责任的玩忽态度，该厂厂长郭力应予记大过处分，通报全区，以资教育。　（杰）
