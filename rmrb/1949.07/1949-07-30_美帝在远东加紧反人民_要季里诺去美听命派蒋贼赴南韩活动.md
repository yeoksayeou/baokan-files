Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 29th: Reports from various sources indicate that the US government issued a brief statement on the 27th, announcing that it had invited Philippine President Quirino to visit Truman in the US on August 8th. According to the Associated Press, citing reliable sources, the so-called "Pacific Pact" will be the primary topic of discussion during the Quirino-Truman meeting. Although Truman had stated a few days ago that he knew nothing about Quirino's visit to the US, US Ambassador to the Philippines, Cowen, inadvertently revealed that Manila and Washington had exchanged notes regarding Quirino's visit to the US and had been discussing it for nine months. These facts show that the US government's "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance" plan, which opposes the people of the Far East, especially the Chinese people, will move from behind-the-scenes maneuvering to open participation.

At the same time, according to the "allocation plan" announced by the Philippine official spokesperson on the 26th, the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, who is responsible for liaising with the "Korean side," will soon go to Seoul to meet with the American puppet Syngman Rhee. Chiang’s bandit Shao Yulin, the "ambassador" stationed in Syngman Rhee's puppet government, has already flown to Seoul on the 25th to arrange this matter.

　　美帝在远东加紧反人民 　 要季里诺去美听命派蒋贼赴南韩活动
    【新华社北平二十九日电】各方报道：美国政院于二十七日发表简短公报，宣布美政府已邀请菲总统季里诺于八月八日至美访问杜鲁门。据合众社引可靠方面消息，所谓“太平洋联盟”将为季、杜会谈的首要讨论事项。虽然杜鲁门数日前曾声称对季里诺的访美计划毫无所悉，但美国驻菲大使科温却于无意中泄露：马尼拉与华盛顿间曾就季里诺访美事，互致照会，并已谈论了九个月之久。这些事实显示，美国政府对于反对远东人民，特别是中国人民的所谓“太平洋反共联盟”计划，将由幕后的策动变为公开的参加。
    同时，依照菲官方发言人二十六日所宣布的“分配计划”，担任联络“韩国方面”任务的匪首蒋介石，不久都将赴汉城会见美国的傀儡李承晚。蒋贼派驻李承晚傀儡政府的“大使”邵匪毓麟，已于二十五日飞抵汉城，布置此事。
