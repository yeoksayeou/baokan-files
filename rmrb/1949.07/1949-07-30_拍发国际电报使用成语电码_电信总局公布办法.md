　　Using Codebooks for International Telegrams
　　General Telecommunications Administration Announces Measures
　　[Our Newspaper] In order to develop domestic production and promote international trade to support economic construction, the General Telecommunications Administration has drafted "Interim Measures on Opening the Use of Commercial Codebooks for Sending International Telegrams," which has been approved and ordered to be implemented by local telecommunications bureaus within the Liberated Areas starting from today. Senders can send coded telegrams according to these measures, limited to five types of commercial codebooks as temporarily stipulated by the General Administration. The names of these codebooks will also be announced at local telecommunications bureaus. The measures are as follows:
　　1. The General Telecommunications Administration, in order to reduce the burden of telegram fees on the people, to promote legitimate foreign trade during the Liberation War, and to prevent illegal reporting, has specially formulated these Interim Measures on the Use of Commercial Codebooks for Sending International Telegrams.
　　2. For sending international telegrams, the phrases in commercial codebooks are allowed to be used to replace the text of the telegram. The telegram fees for these coded messages will be calculated according to the regulations of international telegrams. The commercial codebooks used shall be limited to commercially available codebooks that are commonly used internationally and shall not use privately compiled codebooks.
　　3. When a sender uses a commercial codebook to send an international telegram, in addition to writing the telegram in coded language, either the whole text or a part of the text in code, on the outgoing telegram form as per usual practice, the sender should also translate the entire telegram into plain language and append it to the bottom of the telegram, and indicate the name and edition of the codebook used.
　　4. For telegrams sent from abroad using commercial codebooks as the whole or a part of the text, the name and edition of the codebook used shall be noted in the remarks column of the telegram header.
　　5. International telegrams using commercial codebooks shall be translated by the sender or receiver. If the telecommunications bureau encounters telegrams that have not been translated into plain language, or have not indicated the name and edition of the codebook used, or even if they have been translated and annotated but there are still doubts, the bureau may suspend transmission and delivery, or notify the sender or receiver to bring the codebook to the bureau for verification before proceeding.
　　6. The implementation and termination of these measures shall be announced by the General Telecommunications Administration.
