　　People's Bank of China Tianjin Branch
    Issues 1.2 Billion Loans to Support Public and Private Export Trade
    [This newspaper, Tianjin] In order to develop export trade and promote the exchange of goods, the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China issued a total of 1,280 million yuan in export loans to public and private enterprises in June. Among them, private export loans (including packing loans, raw goods loans, and export bill advances without letters of credit) accounted for 426.6 million yuan, exceeding the original plan of 250 million yuan for June by 70.4 percent, and exceeding the 22.3 million yuan in May by 90 percent. Among private export loans, carpets accounted for 38.35 percent, straw braid accounted for 16.36 percent, fur accounted for 12.62 percent, mountain products accounted for 8.89 percent, sausage casings accounted for 2.93 percent, and other items accounted for 13.52 percent. The foreign exchange converted from public and private export loans this month totaled: US$391,000, £2,800, HK$681,000, and S$4,400.
    In issuing private export loans, in order to overcome the mechanization of loan work, take care of the actual difficulties of borrowers, and strive for favorable sales of export goods abroad, in addition to allowing raw materials as collateral and simplifying warehousing procedures, it is permissible to use other goods as collateral before the export goods are purchased. For example, the handicrafts exports of Zhen De and Xinglong were allowed to use carpets and fur as collateral first, and then supplement the handicrafts; Sheng Xifu Hat Shop first used felt hat bodies as collateral, and then went to Yexian, Shandong, and other places to purchase straw braid tops for export exchange; Qi Long Company originally used goat hair as collateral, but because the foreign market was not good when it was due, it was allowed to export horse tail hair at the request of the company; Zhongfa Commercial Company originally used Jingzhou hemp as collateral, and for the same reason, changed to horse tail hair instead.
    At present, the Bank of China's loans for export materials only support the process from the acquisition, processing, manufacturing, or sorting and packing in Tianjin for export and settlement of foreign exchange. In the future, in order to further ensure that local products are continuously transported to Tianjin and to reduce export costs, so that loans can more fully play their role in promoting internal and external exchanges and urban-rural mutual assistance, it has been decided to provide assistance from the place of origin to Tianjin by means of import bill advances. It has now been decided that the locations for handling bill advances are Zhangjiakou, Jinan, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Beiping, and Tangshan. The specific measures have been formulated. Import bill advances in Zhangjiakou have already begun. We are contacting local People's Banks in other locations and they can also begin handling them within a few days.　　　　　　　　　　　(Weijin)

　　人民银行天津分行　
    扶植公私出口贸易发放贷款十二亿
    【本报天津讯】中国人民银行天津分行为开展出口贸易及促进物资交流，六月份发放公营、私营出口贷款共十二亿八千余万元。其中私营出口贷款（包括打包放款、生货贷款、无信用证出口押汇）占四亿二千六百余万元，超过六月份原计划二亿五千万元的百分之七十点四，较五月份二亿二千三百余万元超出百分之九十。私营出口贷款中，地毯占百分之三十八点三五，草帽辫占百分之十六点三六，皮毛占百分之十二点六二，山货占百分之八点八九，肠衣占百分之二点九三，其他占百分之十三点五二。本月公、私营出口贷款所换回之外汇，计：美金三十九万一千余元，英镑二千八百余镑，港币六十八万一千余元，星币四千四百余元。
    在发放私营出口贷款中，为了克服执行贷款工作的机械化，照顾借户的实际困难及争取出口货物在国外有利销售，除了准以原料作押及简化租库手续外，在出口货未购妥以前，准先以他货作押。如振德、兴隆两户的手工艺品出口，准先以地毯、皮毛作押，后补手工艺品；盛锡福帽庄先以呢帽胎作押，然后到山东掖县等地收购草帽辫顶换出口；启隆行原以山羊毛作押，但因到期国外行市不好，准循该行之请，以马尾结汇出口；中发商业公司原以荆州麻作押，也因同样情形，改以马尾代替出口。
    现在中行对于出口物资贷款，只扶助了从天津当地收购加工制造或整理打包出口结汇一段过程。今后为进一步使土产品源源运津与减低出口成本，使贷款更充分的发挥其促进内外交流城乡互助的作用，已决定由产地到天津这一段，用进口押汇的方式予以贷助。现决定办押汇地点的有：张家口、济南、保定、石家庄、北平、唐山六地。具体办法已拟定。张家口的进口押汇已开始办理。其他各地正与当地人民银行联系，日内亦可开始办理。　　　　　　　　　　　（维进）
