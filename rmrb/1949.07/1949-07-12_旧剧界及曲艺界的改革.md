　　(Cultural Congress Communication)
　　Peking opera, local operas, and various forms of performing arts have historically been important parts of the cultural and entertainment life of Chinese cities and villages, and have had a great influence on the ideology, customs, and habits of all social strata. Some of its content and forms are popular with the common people and worthy of our critical acceptance, while others are full of feudal and superstitious toxins that need to be transformed. The old society's scholar-officials, on the one hand, loved these old forms of art and tried their best to promote and encourage its backward aspects that were conducive to the ruling class, and on the other hand, they humiliated them, regarding "storytelling and opera singing" as lowly and inferior. In the new society, these old artists have finally turned themselves around. People love them and respect them even more, and at the same time, they are determined to transform them and develop them. The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, with representatives from the Peking opera, local opera, and performing arts circles, is a good example.
　　Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, and Zhou Xinfang (麒麟童), who are renowned in the Peking opera circles, were all representatives who were generally welcomed at the congress. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, Mei Lanfang lived in seclusion in Shanghai for ten years, refusing to perform for the enemy and puppets. He has now returned because of the victory of the people. Cheng Yanqiu also hid in the countryside of Qinglong Bridge out of shame to serve the enemy. After the liberation of Beiping, he went abroad to participate in the Prague World Peace Congress. Zhou Xinfang performed "Emperor Huiqin" and other plays when Japan occupied Shanghai, promoting national integrity. The other twenty or thirty representatives of old artists were representatives from various places who were familiar with various opera skills, such as Li Shaochun (Beiping), Yin Riqiao (Harbin), who were good at Peking opera creation, Guo Lanying, who was good at Shanxi Bangzi, Wang Congwen, who was good at Shangdang (Changzhi, Shanxi) Luozihu, Zhang Kuoshi's Ping opera, Lian Kuoru (Beiping)'s storytelling, and Dong Tianmin's variety show were also famous choices at the time.
　　These representatives of old operas and performing arts received warm applause whenever they spoke. They all agreed that this congress was an unprecedented grand event of unity between the old and new literary and art circles, and that participating in this congress was a rare honor in their lives. Mei Lanfang's speech expressed his happy mood in every sentence. He said that he felt that the content of old operas needed to be reformed, and hoped that the People's Government and literary and art leading organs would guide and assist in carrying out the reform, so that old operas could truly achieve the goal of serving the people under the banner of New Democracy. Zhou Xinfang believed that "the congress is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reform old operas." Wang Congwen, in a loud and powerful voice, described how he was forced by poverty to go to sea to sing opera when he was a poor farmer, and was ridiculed as: "Actors are the sons of tortoises," oppressed like cattle and horses; after the Communist Party came and divided the land, his younger brother became the district chief, and he himself was selected as the first-class model literary and art worker in Taihang, "Old artists have completely turned themselves around." As he spoke, he jumped high on the stage with excitement. Such feelings were not a minority among them. On July 6, Ye Shengzhang (chairman of the association, a famous martial clown), Ye Shenglan (a famous young male actor), Xu Dongming, Xu Donglai, Xiao Shengxuan and other representatives of the Beiping National Opera Association presented a banner to the congress. Ye Shengzhang also spoke on behalf of the association, recounting the past sufferings and future hopes:
　　"Old opera is originally the legacy of feudal society, so most of the content is feudal superstition. In the era of reactionary rule, we have always been despised by society and regarded as entertainment and the pastime of the leisure class. Although we also have conscious colleagues and new literary and art workers to cooperate with, and have also done some transformation work bit by bit, the obscurantist policy of the opposition has always persecuted us. It was not until after liberation that we had a greater awareness and deeply felt that the art of old opera also needed to turn itself around. We must break away from the scope of feudalism and unite with the broad masses of the people to serve the people. In this way, old opera must be actively transformed. However, most of our colleagues lost their schooling in their early years, so it is impossible to shoulder such arduous and heavy work entirely on our own. We hope that comrades engaged in drama work and comrades engaged in new literature and art can value old opera and help us as much as possible to do it, so that the art of old opera can be reborn and achieve the mission of serving the people. We are determined to work hard under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the direction he pointed out, and with the assistance of all of you gentlemen and comrades."
　　On July 10, Cao Baolu (chairman of the association, a famous single-string master), Hou Baolin (a famous cross-talk comedian), Hua Xiaobao (Meihua tune), and Xin Lanyun (Jingyin drum) of the Beiping Performing Arts Association also represented 600 members of the Beiping performing arts to present a banner to the congress with the inscription "We sing for the people," and said the same meaning as the National Opera Association: "Just when the whole country is about to be liberated, our national literary and art workers are victoriously gathering in Beiping to summarize our past experiences and discuss the future direction and methods of our literature and art. This is a new era for our literary and art work. ... We are willing to follow the decisions and instructions of the congress on reforming old art to work hard, in order to achieve the goal of serving the people." Yuan Xuefen, a Yue opera worker in Shanghai, could not go to Beiping because of work needs, and sent a letter to the congress saying: "Nightmares and darkness have passed! Today, facing the unfolding of a new history, I feel infinite joy and fear the greatness of our future responsibilities. I hope the congress can give me correct instructions and lead us... to work hard for the people's drama art."
　　The words are sincere, the turnaround is a living fact, and the close unity and mutual assistance between new and old literary and art workers under the correct literary and art direction will surely bloom brilliant flowers of the people's art. During the congress, old artists have performed Peking opera "Wild Boar Forest" with new content, storytelling "The Long March Crossing the Wujiang River," Pingyin drum "Three Warriors Pushing a Broken Boat," Meihua tune "Labor Heroine," and new films "Model Worker Ji Gengsheng," and the representatives have paid great attention to these performances with great concern.

　　旧剧界及曲艺界的改革
    （文代大会通讯）
    平剧、地方剧及各种曲艺，历来是中国城市和乡村文化娱乐生活的重要部分，对于社会各阶层的思想意识习俗风尚都有很大的影响。它的内容和形式，有的是老百姓喜闻乐见值得我们批判接受的，也有的是满含了封建迷信的毒素需要我们进行改造的。旧社会的士大夫对这些旧形式艺术，一方面是爱好，竭力提倡助长它的有利于统治阶级的落后的东西，一方面是污辱，“说书唱戏”被视为下贱末流。到新社会，这些旧型艺术的艺人才算翻了身，人们喜爱他，更尊重他，同时又决心改造他，发展他，这次全国文学艺术工作者代表大会，平剧、地方剧、曲艺各界都派有代表参加，就是很好的例证。
    平剧界素负盛名的梅兰芳、程砚秋、周信芳（麒麟童）都是大会上受到普遍欢迎的代表。梅兰芳在敌伪统治时期，十年蛰居上海，拒绝替敌伪演戏，子都留过，这次是因人民的胜利而归来。程砚秋也曾因耻事敌人而遁迹青龙桥乡下，北平解放后，并出国参加了布拉格世界和平大会。周信芳在日本占领上海时，演出“徽钦二帝”等剧，提倡了民族气节。其余旧艺人代表二三十位，都是来自各地稔熟各种戏曲技艺的代表人物，如李少春（北平）、尹日樵（哈尔滨），长于平剧创生，郭兰英长于山西梆子，王聪文长于上党（山西长治）落子，张阔时的评戏，连阔如（北平）的评书，董天民的游艺，也是一时的名选。
    这些旧剧及曲艺界代表，每有发言都博得热烈的欢迎的掌声。他们自己也一致认为这次大会是新旧文艺界空前团结的盛举，参加这次大会是一生中稀有的光荣。梅兰芳发言句句倾吐着愉快的心情，他说他感到旧剧内容有改革的必要，希望人民政府和文艺领导机关指导协助，进行改革，使旧剧在新民主主义旗帜下，真正达到为人民服务的目的。周信芳认为“大会是改革旧剧的千载一时的机会”，王聪文以洪亮有力的声调，叙述他由贫苦农民被生活所迫而下海唱戏时受嘲弄为：“戏子戏子王八弟子”，象牛马样被人压迫；等共产党来了分了地，弟弟当了区长，自己在太行被选为第一等模范文艺工作者，“旧艺人才算彻底翻了身了”。他说着，兴奋得在台上高高的跳了起来。具有这种心情的在他们中间并不是少数。七月六日在北平市国剧公会代表叶盛章（该会理事长，有名的武丑），叶盛兰（名小生），徐东明、徐东莱、萧盛萱等向大会献旗。叶盛章并代表讲话，叙述了往日的苦楚和今后的希望：
    “旧剧本来是封建社会的遗产，所以内容大多是封建迷信的。在反动统治时代，我们一直遭受社会轻视，被看做了娱乐品，和有闲阶级的消遣品。我们虽然也有觉悟的同人和新文艺工作者合作，也点点滴滴做了一些改造的工作，可是反对派的愚民政策，却随时对我们加以迫害。直到解放以后，我们有了更大的觉悟，深深的感到旧剧的艺术也要翻身了。必须脱离封建的范围与广大的人民结合起来为人民服务。这样旧剧就必须积极的加以改造。可是我们同人大多是幼年失学，这样艰巨而繁重的工作，完全靠自己担负是不可能的，我们希望从事戏剧工作的同志们，从事新文艺的同志们，能够重视旧剧，能够尽量协助我们来做，使旧剧艺术得到新生，达到为人民服务的使命。我们决在毛主席的领导和他指示的方向和诸位先生各位同志的协助之下向前努力。”
    七月十日北平市曲艺公会曹宝禄（该会理事长单弦名手）、侯宝林（有名的相声家）、花小宝（梅花调）、新岚云（京音大鼓）等也代表北平六百名曲艺会员向大会献了“我们为人民歌唱”的锦旗，并说了和国剧公会同样意思的话：“正在全国即将解放的时候，我们全国的文艺工作者在北平胜利会师，来总结我们过去的经验，讨论我们文艺今后的方向和方法，是我们文艺工作的一个新纪元。……愿意遵循着大会对于改革旧艺术的决议和指示来努力，以期达到为人民服务的目的。”上海越剧工作者袁雪芬因工作需要不能分身北上，特给大会来信说：“恶梦、黑暗已经过去了！今天面对着新的历史的展开，感到了无限欢欣而又悚惧我们未来责任之重大。我希望大会能够给我以正确的指示，领导我们……为人民戏剧艺术努力。”
    话是真心话，翻身是活生生的事实，而新旧文艺工作者在正确的文艺方向之下紧密团结，互相帮助，人民的艺术定会开出灿烂的花朵。大会期间旧艺人已演出了具有新内容的平剧“野猪林”、评书“长征渡乌江”、平音大鼓“三勇士推破船”、梅花调“劳动女英雄”、新洋片“模范工人计根生”，代表们都以极大的关心来注意这些演出。
