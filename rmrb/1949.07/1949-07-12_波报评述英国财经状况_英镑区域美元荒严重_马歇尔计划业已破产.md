Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: Warsaw News Agency dispatch from Warsaw: The Warsaw newspaper recently published an editorial commenting on the economic and financial situation of Britain, emphasizing that Cripps's speech in Parliament was tantamount to admitting the failure of the Labor government's economic policy and the bankruptcy of the Marshall Plan. The newspaper traced the original intention of the Marshall Plan, which was to prevent the development of the US economic crisis and reduce the dollar deficit in Western Europe, but the plan did not achieve either of these goals. The economic situation in the United States is continuing to deteriorate and fall into recession, and the British economy, which relies on the United States, is strongly resentful of the US shift from inflation to deflation. In the first half of 1949, the trade payment deficit between the Sterling Area and the Dollar Area caused a serious dollar shortage. Due to artificial "overproduction" and excessive inventories, the United States restricted the import of British goods while forcing Britain to import American goods; this fact explains why Britain's dollar deficit reached 239 million pounds in half a year. The newspaper then pointed out that in order to improve this situation, Cripps announced a period of "trade standstill", deciding to suspend all purchases from the Dollar Area for a minimum of three months. As a result of this decision, Britain will have to limit the consumption of certain foods and the import of raw materials from the Dollar Area. Cripps also called for lower production costs and called on workers to abandon strikes and the hope of gaining higher incomes. Simultaneously with Cripps's statement, Acheson stated at a press conference in Washington that Britain must improve its chances of competing in the world market. This means that Britain will be forced to lower the prices of goods, even selling them below cost. If the United States' intention to devalue the pound can be realized, the situation can be greatly "improved": the United States will be able to buy British shares at low prices and on installment plans, replacing the bankers of the Sterling Area. The newspaper concluded that capitalist countries cannot have friendly cooperation and are bound to turn against each other. As a result, we see a process of corruption caused by internal contradictions. This is why neither the Marshall Plan nor the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can save the West from its predicament.

　　波报评述英国财经状况
    英镑区域美元荒严重
  　马歇尔计划业已破产
    【新华社北平十一日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：华沙报顷发表社论评述英国的经济财政状况，强调指出克利浦斯在国会的谈话，等于承认了工党政府经济政策的失败和马歇尔计划的破产。该报追溯马歇尔计划的原意是要阻止美国经济危机的发展，和减少西欧的美元亏空，但是这个计划并没有达成上述的任何一个目的。美国的经济状况，正顺着衰退和萧条的各个阶段继续恶化，而倚赖美国的英国经济，对美国之自通货膨胀转至通货紧缩产生强烈怨恨，一九四九年上半年，英镑区域和美元区域之间的贸易支付逆差，造成了严重的美元荒。由于人为的“过度生产”和存货过多，美国限制英国货物的进口，而强使英国输入美国货；这一事实解释了为什么在半年以内英国的美元亏空达到了二亿三千九百万英镑。该报继而指出：为了改善这种情况，克利浦斯宣布了一个“贸易停顿”时期，决定向美元区域的一切购货最低限度停止三个月。由于这一决定的结果，英国将不得不限制某些食品的消费及美元区的原料的进口。克利浦斯也要求降低生产成本，并号召工人放弃罢工及个人获得更高收入的希望。与克利浦斯声明的同时，艾奇逊在华盛顿的记者招待会上声称：英国必需改进它在世界市场上竞争的可能性。这就意味着英国将被迫降低货物的价格，甚至以低于成本的价钱出售。假如美国希望英镑贬值的意图能够实现，则情况可以大大地“改善”：美国将能以低价及分期付款的办法买进英国的股份，取英镑区银行家的地位而代之。该报的结论称：资本主义国家不可能有友谊的合作而必定互相背离。其结果，我们就看到了由于内部矛盾所引起的一个败坏的过程。这就是为什么无论马歇尔计划或是北大西洋联盟都无法挽救西方于困境的原因。
