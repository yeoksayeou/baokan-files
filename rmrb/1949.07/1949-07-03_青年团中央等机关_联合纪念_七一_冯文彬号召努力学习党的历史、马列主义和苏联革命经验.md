[Ping Shi News] To celebrate the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Central Youth League School, the Youth Art Theater, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League held a commemorative meeting at the Majestic Theater on East Chang'an Street on the morning of July 1st. Comrade Feng Wenbin first spoke about the history of the Communist Party of China. He said: The Communist Party of China has undergone twenty-eight years of heroic anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles, and has now achieved a basic victory. Today, in commemorating the Party's birthday, in addition to studying the Party's history, we must also: (1) systematically study Marxism-Leninism, (2) more closely unite the broad masses, and (3) with the spirit of internationalism, learn from the Soviet youth movement and the experience of the Youth League. Comrade Qian Junrui then addressed the conference on internationalism and new patriotism, pointing out that from the birth to the growth of the Communist Party of China, the struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism and feudalism, the Soviet Union and the Communist International provided great assistance and support. Today's victory of the Chinese people is certainly the result of the Chinese people's arduous struggle, but if there were no Soviet Union and Eastern European New Democratic countries, and without the help of Communist Parties and proletarians of all countries in the world, this victory would not have been possible. He used his personal experience abroad to illustrate the joy and encouragement of the people of foreign countries, especially the Soviet Union and Eastern European New Democratic countries, for the victory of the Chinese people, fully demonstrating the spirit of internationalism. The Chinese people should strengthen their study of this spirit. He further explained: On the one hand, we must have internationalism, and on the other hand, we must highly promote a new patriotism that combines with internationalism. We must love the land and resources of our great motherland, love our brave and hardworking people, love our Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, and love our great leader Chairman Mao. We should use this love as a force to promote our construction and defend our motherland.

    联合纪念“七一”
    冯文彬号召努力学习党的历史、马列主义和苏联革命经验
    【平市讯】为庆祝中国共产党二十八周年诞辰，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中央团校、青年艺术剧院及青年团北平市委会，于七一上午假东长安街美琪电影院举行纪念会。首由冯文彬同志讲述中国共产党的历史。他说：中国共产党经过了二十八年的英勇的反帝反封建的斗争，现在已取得基本的胜利，今天纪念党的生日，除了要学习党的历史外，并须：（一）有系统地学习马列主义，（二）更密切地团结广大群众，（三）以国际主义的精神，学习苏联的青年运动及青年团的经验。钱俊瑞同志接着向大会讲国际主义与新的爱国主义，指出：中国共产党自诞生以至壮大，中国人民的反帝反封建的斗争，苏联及共产国际给予极大的援助与支持。今天中国人民的胜利，固然是中国人民艰苦奋斗的结果，但假如没有苏联及东欧新民主主义国家的存在，没有世界各国共产党和无产阶级的帮助，这胜利是不可能的。他以在外国的亲身经验，说明外国尤其是苏联及东欧新民主主义国家的人民对于中国人民胜利的欢欣鼓舞，充分表现出国际主义的精神。中国人民应加强学习这种精神。他进一步说明：我们一方面要有国际主义，另一方面要高度发扬与国际主义相结合的新的爱国主义，我们要热爱我们伟大祖国的土地物产，热爱我们勇敢勤劳的人民，热爱我们的共产党及解放军，热爱我们的伟大领袖毛主席，以这种热爱作为一种力量，来推动我们的建设，保卫我们的祖国。
