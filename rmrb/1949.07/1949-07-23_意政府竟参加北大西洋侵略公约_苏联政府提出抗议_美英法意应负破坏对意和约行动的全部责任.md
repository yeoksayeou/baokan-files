Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 22nd: TASS Moscow reports: The Soviet government delivered notes to the Italian government and the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on July 19th, protesting Italy's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty. The note pointed out that the Italian government's action violated the Italian Peace Treaty, and the Italian government and the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, which advocated Italy's accession to the treaty, should be held responsible for this action. In the note to the Italian government, the Soviet government stated: "The Italian Peace Treaty stipulates that the treaty shall serve as the foundation for friendly relations between Italy and each signatory state of the treaty. Italy, having signed the treaty, is obligated not to engage in any action against the signatory states of the treaty, and therefore must not participate in any military alliance or other group formed for the purpose of pursuing aggression. However, by participating in the North Atlantic Treaty, Italy has joined a military group that is aggressive and directed against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies." The note went on to point out that countries joining the North Atlantic Treaty must undertake military obligations such as expanding their armies and armaments, establishing a network of naval and air bases, and preparing to use atomic weapons. The note cited the fact that the Italian government requested military assistance from the US government on April 6th of this year to strengthen its armed forces and expand its arms production as proof. The note convincingly revealed in detail that the Italian government's action directly violated Articles 46, 53, 56, 59, 61, and 64 of the Italian Peace Treaty. The note further pointed out that as early as October 9th of last year, Italian Defense Minister Pacciardi declared to the Italian Senate that the Italian armed forces had reached the limit stipulated by the Italian Peace Treaty. This proves that the Italian government's request for the US government to help further strengthen the Italian armed forces is pursuing military objectives beyond the scope stipulated by the treaty.

　　意政府竟参加北大西洋侵略公约
  　苏联政府提出抗议
    美英法意应负破坏对意和约行动的全部责任
    【新华社北平二十二日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府于七月十九日向意大利政府及美、英、法三国政府分别提出照会，抗议意大利参加北大西洋公约。照会指出，意大利政府的这种行动违反对意和约，意大利政府与倡议意大利加入该公约的美、英、法三国政府对这种行动应负责任。苏联政府在致意政府的照会中指出：“对意和约规定，和约须成为意大利与和约各签字国间友好关系的基础。意大利既签署和约，即负有义务，不得从事任何针对和约签字国的行动，因而不得参加任何军事同盟或其他为奉行侵略目的而组成的集团。但是，由于参加了北大西洋公约，意大利已加入具有侵略性并针对苏联与人民民主国家的军事集团。”照会继而指出：加入北大西洋公约的国家，须承担扩充军队与军备、建立海空军基地网、准备使用原子武器等军事义务。照会举出意大利政府于今年四月六日向美国政府要求军事援助，以加强其武装部队并扩大其军火生产的事实，以为证明。照会令人信服地详细揭发意大利政府的这种行动，直接违反对意和约第四十六条，第五十三条，第五十六条，第五十九条，第六十一条，第六十四条的规定。照会又指出，早在去年十月九日，意大利国防部长巴西亚第即曾向意上院宣称：意大利武装部队已到达对意和约所规定的限额。由此证明，意政府请求美政府帮助进一步加强意大利武装部队，是奉行超出和约规定范围以外的军事目的。
