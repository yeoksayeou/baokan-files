　　Dimitrov's Instructions
    Comrade Dimitrov instructed us to strengthen the sacred friendship with the Soviet Union with all our strength, and to cooperate closely with the people's democratic countries, because this is the main guarantee of our national independence. Our leader and mentor instructed us to wage an irreconcilable struggle against any traitorous manifestations of nationalism, and to be loyal to proletarian internationalism, to the great Bolshevik Party, and to Comrade Stalin to the end. Comrade Dimitrov, we swear to you that your instructions are most sacred to us, and we will fulfill them.
    Comrade Dimitrov instructed us to safeguard and defend the national independence and state sovereignty of our motherland with all our strength, so as to prevent it from any imperialist aggression. This is the second sacred instruction you gave us, and we swear to you, Comrade Dimitrov, that we will fulfill it.
    Comrade Dimitrov instructed us to resolutely stand in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union, and to wage a resolute struggle against the new war instigators of imperialism. This is the third sacred instruction you gave us, and we swear to you, Comrade Dimitrov, that we will fulfill it.
    Comrade Dimitrov instructed us to maintain the Marxist-Leninist unity of the Communist Party and the purity of its ranks, and to consolidate and expand its ties with the working people. This is the fourth sacred instruction you gave us, and we swear to you, Comrade Dimitrov, that we will fulfill it.
    Comrade Dimitrov instructed us to maintain and strengthen with all our strength the militant and fraternal alliance between the working class and the laboring peasants—the pillars of the people's democratic state. This is the fifth sacred instruction you gave us, and we swear to you, Comrade Dimitrov, that we will fulfill it.
    Comrade Dimitrov instructed us to expand and strengthen the Fatherland Front—the united organization of the militant alliance between workers and all laboring people in urban and rural areas (the broadest social foundation of the people's democratic regime). This is the sixth sacred instruction you gave us, Comrade Dimitrov, and we swear to you that we will fulfill it.
    Comrade Dimitrov instructed us to love our people, our country, and to treat the enemies of the people and the enemies of the people's regime, as well as foreign agents and spies, ruthlessly, and to be vigilant against them. This is the seventh sacred instruction you gave us, and we swear to you, Comrade Dimitrov, that we will fulfill it.
    Comrade Dimitrov instructed us to pay attention to and be sensitive to the needs of the people, to listen to their voices, to not only teach the working people, but also learn from them, and to quickly correct the mistakes and shortcomings that have been made. This is the eighth sacred instruction you gave us, and we swear to you, Comrade Dimitrov, that we will fulfill it.
    Comrade Dimitrov instructed us to rely on the support of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and to constantly learn from the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, so as to ensure the victory of socialism in our country. We swear to you, beloved mentor, that we will spare no effort and will not be hindered by any obstacles to carry out this main will of yours. Comrade Dimitrov instructed us to learn from the great Bolshevik Party (headed by Stalin, the recognized leader of the international labor and communist movement). This is the ninth sacred instruction you gave us, and we swear to you, Comrade Dimitrov, that we will fulfill it.
    Building socialism in our country will be the best memorial to Dimitrov. Let the name of Dimitrov—the great son of Bulgaria—be immortalized forever! Let his glory be eternally immortalized! Long live the Bulgarian Communist Party and its victory! Long live the Fatherland Front! Long live the laboring people of Bulgaria! Long live our leader and mentor, the leader and mentor of all progressive humanity, Stalin!
