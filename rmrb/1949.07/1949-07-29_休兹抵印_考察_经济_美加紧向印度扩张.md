 　US Intensifies Expansion into India
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 27th: The activities of US monopoly capitalists in expanding into India are intensifying. According to a TASS dispatch from Delhi, Hughes, Vice-Chairman of the US Far East Trading Commission, has arrived in Delhi to "inspect" the Indian economy. In a press conference, Hughes stated that Truman's so-called plan to aid "backward countries" will be fully implemented in India. The TASS dispatch stated that the US Far East Trading Commission has always concentrated its main activities in Japan, attempting to turn Japan into a US colony. Now, judging from Hughes' statement, the commission is planning to expand its activities to India. According to a Reuters report, the US-controlled World Bank intended to export capital to India and sent a delegation to "visit" India. The World Bank's manager and managing director are now considering loans to India but are requesting more information from India.
