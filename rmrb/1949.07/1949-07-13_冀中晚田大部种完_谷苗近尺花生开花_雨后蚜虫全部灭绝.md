[Central Hebei Electric] As of the end of June, the sowing of late-season fields in central Hebei was mostly completed. With the exception of a few areas in the Eighth Administrative Region where rainfall was low and sowing had not yet been completed, most areas took advantage of the soaking rain (on the 25th of last month) to carry out a concentrated sowing effort. According to statistics from the tenth district of Hejian, out of a total of 18,367 mu of spring wasteland and wheat stubble land, 16,057 mu have now been sown with corn, black beans, mung beans, late millet, yams, and millet, accounting for nearly 90% of the wasteland area. The Ninth Administrative Region completed sowing after the wheat harvest because it has a lot of irrigated land. Sowing in wheat fields in the Tenth Administrative Region has also been completed. Various localities also widely provided loans for seeds. Hejian County alone loaned out approximately 12,000 jin of corn and mung beans. Due to timely rainfall and meticulous cultivation, autumn seedlings are growing quickly. In the Eighth Administrative Region, sorghum seedlings are already one foot four or five inches tall, millet seedlings are nearly a foot tall, cotton is more than a foot tall, and peanuts are already blooming; newly sown sorghum seedlings after the hailstorm are also nearly a foot tall. After the rain, all cotton aphids in the region were exterminated, and cotton seedlings are becoming increasingly lush.

　　冀中晚田大部种完
  　谷苗近尺花生开花
  　雨后蚜虫全部灭绝
    【冀中电】截至六月底，冀中晚田播种大部完成。全区除八专少数地区雨量小尚未完成播种外，大部地区趁透雨（上月二十五日）后突击播种，据河间十区统计，春白地和麦茬共一万八千三百六十七亩，现已种上玉米、黑豆、绿豆、晚谷、山药、黍子等共一万六千零五十七亩，占白地面积近百分之九十。九专区因水浇地多，麦收后即已完成播种。十专区麦田播种也已完成。各地并普遍贷种，仅河间一县即贷出玉米、绿豆约一万二千市斤。由于雨水及时和耕作精细，秋苗长的很快。八专区高粱苗已一尺四五寸，谷苗近尺，棉花一尺多，花生已开花；雹后新播的高粱苗亦近尺高。雨后全区棉花蚜虫全部灭绝，棉苗日渐旺盛。
