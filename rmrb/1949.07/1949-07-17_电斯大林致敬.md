    Telegram to Marshal Stalin with Respect
    [Ping City News] The inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association sent the following telegram of respect to Marshal Stalin:

    To Marshal Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union:

    We, the Chinese people who have suffered deeply, began the struggle against foreign aggressors for national independence and freedom very early on. But it was not until after the October Revolution that China took on a new look. Now the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong, has achieved basic victory after nearly thirty years of struggle. In the future, we Chinese people will carry out arduous economic construction and cultural construction to transform our motherland from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country.

    As we celebrate the victory of the Chinese revolution with excitement and joy, we cannot forget the enlightenment and encouragement given to the Chinese people by the great Lenin and the Russian October Revolution led by you, we cannot forget the great sympathy and help of the Soviet Union to the Chinese national liberation movement, we cannot forget the decisive role of the Soviet Union in defeating German, Japanese, and Italian fascism, and we cannot forget the strong leadership of the Soviet Union in the world democratic and peaceful camp after the war. In the future struggle to continue to oppose imperialism and strive for world people's democracy and lasting peace, the revolutionary theory greatly developed and enriched by you, as well as the rich experience of Soviet socialist construction, will be the powerful weapon for the Chinese people to build their country. We extend our warmest respects to you! And we congratulate you on the great achievements of Soviet socialist construction!

    The purpose of our initiating the establishment of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association" is to establish and develop cultural and economic ties between China and the Soviet Union, to introduce the Soviet Union's rich experience in nation-building and scientific culture to the Chinese people, to develop and consolidate the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and to strive for lasting world peace.

    Long live the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

            The Inaugural Meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
            July 16th

    电斯大林致敬
    【平市讯】中苏友好协会发起人大会向斯大林大元帅致敬电，原电如下：苏联部长会议主席斯大林大元帅：
    我们灾难深重的中国人民，很早就开始了反对外国侵略者、争取民族独立与自由的斗争。但是直到十月革命后，中国的面貌才为之一新。现在中国人民民主革命，在中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛泽东领导之下，经过近三十年的斗争，已经取得了基本的胜利。今后我们中国人民将进行艰巨的经济建设与文化建设，把自己的祖国从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。
    我们在兴奋愉快地庆祝中国革命胜利的时候，不能忘记伟大的列宁和您所领导的俄国十月革命给与中国人民的启示和鼓舞，不能忘记苏联对中国民族解放运动的伟大同情和帮助，不能忘记苏联在战胜德日意法西斯中的决定的作用，不能忘记战后苏联对世界民主和平阵营的坚强领导。在今后继续反对帝国主义、争取世界人民民主和永久和平的斗争中，您所大大发展和充实了的革命理论，以及苏联社会主义建设的丰富经验，将是中国人民建国的强大武器。我们向致热烈的敬礼！并为苏联社会主义建设的伟大成就表示庆贺！
    我们发起成立“中苏友好协会”的目的，是在建立和发展中苏两国文化经济等方面的联系，向中国人民介绍苏联建国的丰富经验和科学文化，发展和巩固中苏两国人民的深厚友谊，为争取世界永久和平而奋斗。
    中苏两国人民友好万岁！
            中苏友好协会发起人大会
