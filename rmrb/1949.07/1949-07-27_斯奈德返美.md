　　Snyder Returns to the United States
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 26th] Reports from various sources: U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder has flown back to the United States on the 24th after an "official visit" to Western Europe and the Near East lasting nearly a month. Snyder left the United States for Europe on the 3rd of this month. He separately "visited" France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, Turkey, Egypt, and Greece, conducting financial and economic negotiations with the authorities of those countries. The details of Snyder's negotiations in Brussels, Rome, Ankara, Cairo, and Athens have been kept secret. When Snyder initially "visited" Europe, political and economic figures in Paris were deeply convinced that "Snyder's main purpose in visiting the Marshall Plan countries was to seek ways to delay the impending U.S. economic crisis."

　　斯奈德返美
    【新华社北平二十六日电】各方报道：美财长斯奈德在西欧及近东“访问”将及一月之后，已于二十四日飞返美国。斯奈德是于本月三日离美赴欧的。他曾分“访”法国、英国、比利时、意大利、土耳其、埃及与希腊，与各该国当局进行财政经济谈判。斯奈德在布鲁塞尔、罗马、安哥拉、开罗及雅典谈判的情形一直保守秘密。当斯奈德“访”欧初期，巴黎政界及经济界人士深信：“斯奈德访问马歇尔计划各国的主要目的，是寻求用以延缓迫近的美国经济危机的方法。”
