The Creation and Performance of "Selling the Ox"
　　Lin Yang Shi Ding
　　I. The Beginning of Exploration
　　When we arrived in Linyi County, Jin-Sui Border Region (belonging to the Northwest Liberated Area) during our spring tour, it was the time of the Lunar February Mule and Horse Fair. Farmers from all around flocked to attend the first lively market after the Spring Festival. We ourselves felt that simply performing our original programs would only have a limited effect on enlivening the market. We should combine our theatrical art with the specific realities of the Mule and Horse Fair to play a combat role on the economic front as much as possible. At the same time, the comrades of the Linyi County Trade Bureau—the governing body of the Mule and Horse Fair—also asked us to reflect some of the issues in economic construction in our art. Thus, we decided to give it a try. However, in the three days we stayed in Linyi, we had to perform five shows, and the most difficult thing was the severe time constraint. After research, on the first day, we assigned a comrade to visit the governing body of the Mule and Horse Fair to learn about the overall market situation and some specific examples. In the evening, after the performance, he reported to all the comrades involved in writing. Everyone immediately studied the report, identified several central issues from all the materials as the writing focus, and then several writing groups were formed voluntarily. On the second day, they wrote two costumed skits and a small Yangko opera, "Selling the Ox." They performed them separately on the third day. All these things, from writing to rehearsal, took only about half a day, squeezed out of their busy schedules—before and after meals, during the waiting time before meals, after putting on makeup before going on stage, sacrificing sleep, etc. The time was so rushed, and if we only discuss the play itself, it has many shortcomings, at least it's rough. However, in the process from writing to performance, we explored some new issues...

　　II. The Content of "Selling the Ox"
　　The theme of "Selling the Ox" is to criticize the "livestock brokers" (middlemen in livestock trading, mostly urban and rural vagrants) at the Mule and Horse Fair, and to expose their exploitation and deception of buyers and sellers. Originally, before the Mule and Horse Fair, the Linyi County Trade Bureau convened a meeting of all the "livestock brokers." After their own democratic discussion, they decided to take one percent "brokerage fee" (one yuan for every hundred yuan), charging the seller but not the buyer. The Trade Bureau also printed this decision into a public notice and posted it in the cattle and horse market. However, some individual "livestock brokers" still secretly acted as before, not following the regulations, charging commissions from both sides (buyers and sellers), and even extorting money. Some farmers suffered losses because they did not know the regulations of the Trade Bureau, resulting in good livestock not being sold at good prices, or paying high prices without buying good livestock. Such market disruptions harmed the farmers a lot. ... ...

　　III. Unity of Creators and Performers
　　This creation started off in a novel way. Based on the preliminary materials we understood, the four of us (Zheng Ying, Miao Bo, and the two of us) studied the performance center, characters, and performance methods. Before even starting to write, we assigned roles: Lin Yang played the ox seller, Zheng Ying played the buyer, Shi Ding played "livestock broker" A, and Miao Bo played "livestock broker" B. Everyone went to the Trade Bureau together once to more specifically inquire about the policies on "livestock brokers" and the crux of the problems in actual implementation. We also used our own time to go to the cattle and horse market separately to talk to buyers, sellers, and "livestock brokers" individually, studying and observing life and the characters. Each person collected materials specifically related to their own role, especially actions and language. However, due to the excessively short time, the total collection time was only about three hours pieced together. In summary, we only achieved a very conceptual understanding of the policy aspects, and only a very superficial impression of life, character language, and actions. Therefore, the script was difficult to write. Helplessly, we invited Comrade Che Kuan, the head of the trade section of the Mule and Horse Fair, to participate and offer opinions to carry out the creation together.

　　IV. Creating and Performing Together with the Masses
　　At this time, we had someone who understood the policies, someone who mastered the creative methods and techniques. When the five of us (including Comrade Che Fakuan) studied the central content of the play again, we found that the play needed a government worker to appear at the end to resolve the dispute. After obtaining Comrade Che Fakuan's consent, we immediately added a government worker and asked him to play the role. When we started to "write" (not written by one person, nor each character writing their own parts separately, but the five of us sitting together, according to the central content of each scene to be performed, and according to the task of their own character in the play, the actors themselves improvised the lyrics and dialogue in the "dialogue." If other actors thought it was acceptable, that actor would write it down), we discovered a big problem: regarding the character of the "livestock broker," he had many unique "trade terms," habits, and actions (expressions) that were not properly displayed. Therefore, we invited Li Yuechang, the leader of the "livestock brokers" (democratically elected by the "livestock brokers" themselves), and the old-timer Wang Deshen (who had been a "livestock broker" for more than 30 years) to participate. During rehearsals, we found that the vivid expressions and actions, and the extremely rich language of the real "livestock brokers" could not be learned in a short time, and it was even more difficult to learn them well. After research, we withdrew our actor who was playing the "livestock broker" and mobilized Li Yuechang and Wang Deshen to perform. After some persuasion, they finally agreed. During rehearsals, Li and Wang not only performed their own roles vividly, but also guided other actors on how to perform the buyers and sellers. At their suggestion, the play also added content about the "livestock brokers" mutually protecting and excluding each other, making the play more vivid and complete. The reason why we were able to achieve this, we believe, is the result of the combination of policy, creative methods and techniques, and actual life. The key to this combination lies in our exploration of a new way of creating and performing together with the masses in our work.

　　V. After the Performance of "Selling the Ox"
　　After the performance of "Selling the Ox," the farmers who attended the market immediately spread the word about the decision on "livestock brokers" charging commissions, and also learned about the tricks of "livestock brokers" in deceiving people. Many people said: "We won't be fooled by them again!" The audience's unanimous reaction was: "The 'livestock brokers' are just like that, they performed it so vividly!" When the "livestock broker" in the play (played by the old-timer Wang Deshen) said the last paragraph, advising the "livestock brokers" to be honest and not act according to the old ways of thinking, dozens of "livestock brokers" watching the play under the stage said in unison: "That's right!... We have to act according to the democratic discussion, we can't mess around anymore." Li Yuechang, the "livestock broker" who participated in the creation and performance, said: "We have to be honest, otherwise, ordinary people doing business won't need us anymore!" The old-timer Wang Deshen said even more meaningfully: "Today I brokered a deal, the selling price was 16,000 yuan. The seller gave me 200 yuan 'brokerage fee.' I said, 'I can't take it.' The seller said, 'You've been busy for so long, have a few more cakes.' I said: 'No, we have a democratic decision, we only take 160 yuan 'brokerage fee' for 16,000 yuan, we dare not take a penny more. These days (meaning now), if we still act according to the old ways of thinking, we won't get anywhere.'" Comrade Che Fakuan, who participated in the joint creation and performance from the Trade Bureau, said even more contentedly: "This is a hundred times stronger than our posting notices to publicize the policy! I'm also responsible for cultural and entertainment work in our Trade Bureau, but I didn't know how to write scripts before. Today I learned a little bit of skill... ... "

　　“卖牛”的创作及其演出
    林杨  石丁
    一　探索的开始
    当我们春季作巡回公演，抵达晋绥边区（属西北解放区）临县城时，正逢旧历二月的骡马大会，四乡农民都蜂拥前来，赶这春节后第一个热闹的集市。我们自己感到，要是单纯演出原有的节目，最多只能起一点红火市场的作用。应该使我们的戏剧艺术，和骡马大会的具体实际结合起来，尽可能在经济战线上起一些战斗作用，同时，临县贸易局——骡马大会的主管机关——同志，也要求我们把经济建设中的一些问题，反映到艺术中来。于是，我们就决定尝试一下。然而，在临县逗留的三天中，要演出五场戏，最感困难的，是时间太成问题。经过研究，第一天抽出了一个同志，到骡马大会的主管机关，去访问了一些市场全面的情况和若干实例，晚间演出完毕后，他就向全体搞写作的同志做了报告，大家马上进行研究，从全部材料，找出了几个中心问题，作为写作中心，然后大家自愿结合了几个写作小组，第二天便写出了两个化装演唱，和一个小型秧歌剧“卖牛”，第三天就分别演出了。这些个东西，从写作到排演，合计不过半天都是从百忙中硬挤出来的，比如吃饭前后，等待开饭的空隙，化装后上场前，牺牲睡眠等等，时间是如此的匆促，若就戏论戏，那缺陷很多，至少是粗糙，然而，从这次写作到演出过程中，我们却探索到一些新问题……
    二　“卖牛”的内容
    “卖牛”的主题，是批评骡马大会上“畜牙子”（买卖牲口中间的经纪人，多是城乡游民），揭破他们剥削欺骗买卖主；原来在骡马大会之前，临县贸易局，即召集所有“畜牙子”开了会，经他们自己民主讨论，决定取一分“牙佣”（一百元取一元佣钱），取卖主不取买主，贸易局并将这决定印成布告，张贴在牛马市场，但仍有个别“畜牙子”，暗中照旧行事，不按规定，两头（买主卖主）取佣，甚至从中敲榨，有些农民群众，因为不知道贸易局规定，吃亏的不在少数，形成好牲口卖不出好价，或者掏了高价，买不着好牲口。诸如此类扰乱市场情形，对农民群众受害不浅。………
    三　创作者和表演者统一
    这个创作一开始，就有点别开生面，我们四个人（郑英苗波和我们两人）根据初步了解的材料，研究了表现中心和人物及表现方法后，还未着笔，即分配了角色，由林杨饰卖牛人，郑英饰买主，石丁饰“畜牙子”甲，苗波饰“畜牙子”乙。大家共同到贸易局去了一次，更具体的访问了对“畜牙子”的政策，及实际执行中问题的症结，并自己利用时间，分散到牛马市场去，找买卖主及“畜牙子”个别谈话，研究观察生活和人物，每个人根据自己角色，专门收集与自己有关的材料，特别是动作和语言。然而，由于时间过于短促，七拼八凑的约摸有三个钟头，综其所获，政策方面，只做到极概念的了解，生活、人物语言动作方面，只有极浮浅的表面印象，因此，剧本很难写下去，在无可如何下，又邀了骡马大会贸易股负责人车宽同志，请他参加意见共同进行创作。
    四　与群众共同创作共同演出
    这时，掌握政策的人有了，掌握创作方法与创作技巧的人有了，当我们五个人（车发宽同志在内）再次研究剧的中心内容时，发现剧中，须要有一个政府工作人员，最后出场解决纠纷。在取得车发宽同志的同意下，便马上增添了一个工作人员，并且就请他担任了。当着笔“写”时（不是一个人写，也不是各个角色分开自己写，而是五个人坐在一起，根据每段戏所欲表演的中心内容，按照自己角色剧中的任务，在“对词”中，演员自己临时编唱词和对话，其他演员大家觉得可以，那个演员自己就把它写下来），但写着写着，发现一个大难题，关于“畜牙子”这个人，他有许多特有的“行话”、习惯、动作（表情）不是摆得恰为其份，于是便又邀请了“畜牙子”们的头儿李月昌（“畜牙子”们自己民主选举的），和老＠家王德胂（他当了三十多年“畜牙子”）二人来参加。在排演中，我们发现真“畜牙子”的那些生动的表情动作，和极其丰富的语言，不是一时半刻所能学会的，至于要想学得好，更是不容易；研究的结果，抽出了我们饰“畜牙子”的演员，动员李月昌、王德胂二人演，经过一翻说服后，他们终于同意了。在排演中，李王二人不但本角色表演得很生动，同时，他们还指导其他演员如何表演买、卖主；在他们建议之下，全剧并增添了“畜牙子”之间，互相包庇互相排挤的内容，使得全剧更生动完整了。其所以能做到这样，我们认为是政策、创作方法与创作技巧和生活实际结合的结果，而其结合的关键，在于我们从工作中，探索到一个与群众共同创作，与群众共同演出的新的途径。
    五　“卖牛”演出以后
    “卖牛”演出以后，一般赶集的农民，立即传开了关于“畜牙子”取佣的决定，也知道了“畜牙子”骗人的鬼门坎，好些人说：“咱们再不上他们的当了”；看戏观众一致的反映：“畜牙子”就是这个样，演得可神咧（象极了之意）！当剧中“畜牙子”（老＠家王德胂饰）说最后一段话，劝戒“畜牙子”要老老实实，不要按旧脑筋办事时，台下看戏的几十个“畜牙子”，大家齐声说：“对着咧！………咱们就得按民主讨论下的办，不能再胡日鬼子。”参加创作和演出的“畜牙子”李月昌说：“就是要老实哩，不了，老百姓做买卖，就不要咱这号子人了！”老＠家王德胂更意味深长的说：“今天我说合了一宗买卖，卖价是一万六，卖主给我二百元‘牙佣’，我说‘不能要’，卖主说：‘你忙了半天，多吃个把饼子吧’，我说：可不，我们有民主决定，一万六只取一百六‘牙佣’，多一个钱也不敢要，这阵（现在的意思）再按旧脑筋办事，走到哪里也是个吃不开。”贸易局参加共同创作和演出的车发宽同志，更满心满意的说：“这可比咱们贴布告宣传政策强百十倍哩！我在咱贸易局还负责文化娱乐工作，日前就不知道剧本是怎写的，今天还学会了一点本领……。”
