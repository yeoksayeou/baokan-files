[Tianjin Dispatch] Under the strong support of the People's Government, the production of the nationally renowned Jiuda Salt Company, Qixin Cement Company, and Yaohua Glass Company has been gradually restored and developed. Qixin has now exceeded its highest output of last year, and Yaohua's output has even broken the highest record in the factory's history. During the Kuomintang rule, due to the exploitation and persecution of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, these three companies all faced the crisis of collapse. Jiuda and Yaohua stopped work in October last year. A large amount of Qixin cement was requisitioned by the "North China General Headquarters," and it was also brewing a work stoppage on the eve of liberation. After the liberation of Tianjin, the People's Government immediately took various measures to assist the resumption of work of these companies. For example, Tianjin Trading Company purchased more than 1,000 tons of Jiuda washing salt, North China Trading General Company underwrote all of Qixin's finished products, and Tianjin People's Bank approved an overdraft of 10 million yuan. In addition, the Jidong Administrative Office and Jidong Bank respectively lent Yaohua factory 12,500 tons of fuel coal, 340,000 jin of millet, and 8 billion Changcheng coupons, enabling the companies to resume work smoothly. After starting work, Tianjin Jiaotong Bank successively issued six loans totaling more than 50 million yuan to help Jiuda solve the wage problem of spring beach workers. Up to now, the crude salt produced by the company in Tanggu and Dagu has been more than in the same period last year, and the estimated output this year will reach more than 1.1 million dan (the general annual output is 1 million dan). Qixin's output has also increased. In March, it produced more than 11,000 tons of cement blocks, exceeding the average monthly output of last year by 400 tons. The average output in April, May, and June increased to 12,000 tons. Yaohua Glass Company received loans of more than 160 million yuan from the Tianjin Military Control Commission's Industry Department and Jiaotong Bank. North China Trade General Company and Northeast Department Store purchased 14,000 boxes of glass, which initially solved the problem of part of the sales and the turnover of funds. In the first month after the liberation of the factory, production reached more than 40,000 boxes, which exceeded the average monthly output of last year by about one time. The total of 120,000 boxes produced in May and June broke the highest production record in the factory's history (according to the company, the highest output before liberation was in 1943, with an average monthly output of more than 47,000 boxes). In addition, in terms of improving quality and saving materials, the average output per worker in Qixin in May increased by 14% compared with the highest month in the past. The glass produced by Yaohua is also whiter, has fewer bubbles and nodules, and has better flatness than in the past.

　　At present, the capitalists of these companies have begun to have a clear understanding of the People's Government's policy of developing production with consideration for both public and private interests. In particular, after listening to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report, the enthusiasm for management has been further improved. In addition to preparing to expand the equipment for manufacturing magnesium carbonate and sodium sulfide, Jiuda Company's general manager Li Zhuchen also decided not to dismiss the workers who were originally planned to be dismissed. Preliminary opinions on the wage adjustment issue have been drafted and submitted to the trade union and workers for discussion. Qixin Company established a production technology improvement committee in June to study how to improve technology, develop production, and reform old factories, and to plan the construction of new factories. The construction project has now begun, and preparations are being made to add a large number of machines. Yaohua Company's general manager Zhang Xunjian provided the company with 10,000 bags of flour, 2.5 million people's currency, and a set of machine parts from Shanghai before Shanghai was liberated; now the company has also begun to use silica, limestone, sandstone, and other raw materials produced near Qinhuangdao (where the company's factory is located) to replace Xiamen sand, Korean sand, and other raw materials to reduce costs.

　　In the past, Jiuda refined salt was mainly sold in Jiangnan, and Qixin cement and Yaohua glass were also sold throughout the country. At present, due to the incomplete restoration of transportation in various places, there are still some difficulties in the sales of finished products. However, with the increasing smoothness of transportation, this problem can be gradually solved. Therefore, how to further improve quality and reduce costs is the main task of each company at present. Yaohua Company has now decided to change its business policy to face the countryside, planning to directly sell to the countryside through cooperatives in various places, and has sent people to the Northeast, Datong, Xuzhou, Kaifeng and other places to investigate the demand for glass.

　　人民政府供原料收成品
  　津市耀华玻璃公司
  　突破历来最高产量
    启新洋灰公司超过去年最高产量
  　久大盐业公司年产将达百余万担
    【天津电】全国著名之久大盐业公司、启新洋灰公司，及耀华玻璃公司，在人民政府大力扶植下，生产已获得逐步恢复与发展，启新现已超过去年的最高产量，耀华的产量更突破了该厂有史以来的最高纪录。该三公司在国民党统治时期，由于帝国主义与官僚资本主义的压榨与迫害，皆面临倒闭危机，久大，耀华在去年十月间即告停工，启新的大批洋灰，曾被“华北总”征用，解放前夕，也正在酝酿停工。津市解放后，人民政府立即采取种种措施，协助各该公司复工，如津贸易公司收购久大洗涤盐一千余吨，华北贸易总公司包销启新的全部成品，并经津市人民银行准予透支一千万元，以及冀东行署、冀东银行分别借给耀华工厂燃煤一万二千五百吨，小米三十四万斤及长城券八十亿元等，使各该公司得以顺利复工。开工后，津市交通银行又先后发放六次贷款共五千余万元，帮助久大解决了春晒滩工的工资问题，截至目前止，该公司塘（沽）、大（沽）两处所产粗盐已较去年同一时期为多，预计本年产量将达一百一十余万担（一般年产量为一百万担）。启新产量也有增加，三月份生产洋灰块一万一千多吨，超过去年平均月产量四百吨，四、五、六月份平均产量更增至一万二千吨。耀华玻璃公司经津市军管会工业处，交通银行等先后贷款一亿六千余万元，华北贸总及东北百货公司收购玻璃一万四千箱，初步解决了部分销路问题及资金的周转问题，该厂解放后第一月，生产即达四万余箱，约超过去年平均月产量的一倍。五、六两月份共产十二万箱，更突破了该厂有史以来的最高生产纪录（按该公司解放前产量最多时是民国三十二年，平均月产四万七千余箱）。此外，在改进质量节省器材上，启新工人五月份平均每人生产量比过去最高月份提高了百分之十四，耀华所产的玻璃也做到比过去色白、少水泡及瘤子，平度也较好。
    现各该公司资本家对于人民政府发展生产公私兼顾的方针已开始有了明确的认识，特别是听了刘少奇同志的报告后，经营情绪更为提高。久大公司总经理李烛尘，除了准备扩大制造炭酸镁和硫化碱的设备外，原拟解雇的工人也不解雇了。工资调整问题，已拟定初步意见交工会和工人讨论。启新公司六月份成立了生产技术改进会，研究提高技术、发展生产、改革旧有工厂，并筹建新厂，修建工程现已开始，同时准备增加大批机器。耀华公司总经理张训坚，在上海未解放时即由上海接济该公司面粉一万袋，人民券二百五十万及机器零件一部；现该公司并已开始采用秦皇岛（该公司工厂所在地）附近所产的硅石、石灰石、沙岩石等以代替厦门沙、朝鲜沙等原料，减低成本。
    按久大精盐，过去主要销售江南，启新洋灰，耀华玻璃也都普遍销售全国各地，目前由于各地交通运输尚未完全恢复，故在成品销路上还存在一些困难，但随着交通的日益畅通，此问题即可逐渐解决，因此如何进一步提高质量，减低成本，是各该公司当前的主要课题。现耀华公司已决定把营业方针改为面向农村，计划通过各地合作社，向农村直接推销，并已派人赴东北、大同、徐州、开封等地调查玻璃需用量。
