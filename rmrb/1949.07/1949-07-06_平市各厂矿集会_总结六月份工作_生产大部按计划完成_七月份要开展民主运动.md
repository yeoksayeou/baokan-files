　　[This Newspaper Reported] The Enterprise Bureau of the People's Government of Beiping Municipality convened a meeting on July 4th and 5th, attended by military representatives, managers (or factory directors) from twenty units under its jurisdiction, including the Mentougou, Chengzi, and Xishan three major state-owned coal mines, as well as the Tram Company and Water Company. Branch secretaries and labor union chairmen from various factories and mines were also invited to participate. The meeting summarized the work of June and determined that the focus of work for July would be to launch a democratic movement, establish factory management committees, establish and improve a strict cost accounting system, carry out a conservation campaign, and further strengthen factory security.
    The majority of factories and mines completed their production tasks for June according to plan, and some units even exceeded the production figures of May. Blindness in production work has been initially overcome, and attention has begun to be paid to democratic management and security work. The Water Company increased from 32,111 users in May to 32,460 users. The Yanjing Paper Mill's average daily paper production increased from 240 reams in May to 250 reams in June, with the quality maintained at around 40 pounds. The Qinghe Woolen Mill fully resumed production on June 20th. During the restoration period, the cotton weaving department produced more than 4,000 meters of calico more than the original plan in June, and the output of the wool weaving department also exceeded the original plan. The factory also proposed a cost accounting system for time, labor, and materials. The Second Soy Sauce Factory reduced costs by half by using wheat bran and soybean cake instead of sorghum and soybeans. The newly built Glass Factory overcame its original conservative ideas through repeated education. The Mentougou, Xishan, and Chengzi coal mines all vigorously carried out flood prevention projects in June, which are expected to be completed before July 10th. Other units, such as the First Soy Sauce Factory, also increased their output compared to May. The Beijing Machine Kiln Factory and the newly built Kiln Factory, Datai, and Chengzi coal mines all carried out restoration work such as factory building repairs and machine overhauls in June.
    The Municipal Enterprise Bureau had already arranged for various factories and mines to trial enterprise management and factory management democratization and to strengthen factory security in early June, but the implementation of this work by various factories was not thorough. In terms of operation, some factories had excessively high costs and unsalable finished products. Although the output of the Yanjing Paper Mill in June exceeded that of May, the cost did not actually decrease. According to the Enterprise Bureau's investigation, the cost of each ream of paper in the Yanjing Paper Mill was 1,512 yuan, while the cost of each ream in a certain private paper mill was 1,450 yuan, a difference of 62 yuan per ream. Before the reform of several systems in the Mentougou Coal Mine, although monthly output continued to increase, costs also increased month by month. The cost of each ton of coal in June was more than ten catties of millet higher than that of small private kilns. While costs increased, products were not sold in time. The Yanjing Paper Mill produced a large number of unsold paper in two months, and the Mentougou and other three coal mines had more than 90,000 tons of coal in stock, piled up on top of each other, and the mines felt that there was no place to store them anymore. Some mines and factories have not seriously implemented enterprise management, and some people in certain units have shown an irresponsible attitude towards people's property. For example, the Chengzi Coal Mine did not conduct careful investigation when purchasing pig iron, and as a result, it spent 210,000 yuan to buy a ton of pig iron, while the same pig iron could be bought for 160,000 yuan in Beiping and 80,000 to 90,000 yuan in Tianjin.
    Regarding the issue of implementing democratic management of enterprises, the Municipal Enterprise Bureau had already made arrangements for various units in May, but in June, except for the Tram Company, most factories and mines did not implement it well. The Tram Company began on June 22nd, with the help of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, starting from rectifying the trade union and rectifying the relationship between the Party and the masses, and convened a temporary employee representative meeting. The trade union and the administration both conducted self-criticism and mobilized employees to put forward opinions and carry out a democratic reform movement. During the movement, even old workers who had not attended any meetings for many years spoke their minds. There are now demands among the workers to establish a factory management committee. However, the democratic movement in most mines and factories has not yet been launched. Some factories have only carried out formalistic propaganda and have not started from launching a democratic movement. For example, in the Chengzi Coal Mine, the propaganda and education department of the trade union only hired many staff members to lead the study of factory democratic management issues in eleven employee groups. When the leaders thought that "the study was enough," they hastily elected employee representatives from each group. In addition, in units such as the newly built Glass Factory and the newly built Kiln Factory, the cadres' thinking on launching a democratic movement and establishing a management committee simply emphasized objective difficulties. They believe that workers have long working hours and cannot be educated, the work is seasonal and has high mobility, and workers do not have close feelings for the factory. Some factories are more satisfied with their existing democratic achievements, and some, although they have established management committees, still have some problems that have not been resolved. For example, the Water Company's management committee has been established for a month, but the employee representative meeting has not yet been improved.
    Regarding the work of protecting factory safety, the Municipal Enterprise Bureau has repeatedly instructed various factories and mines to be vigilant. Now various factories and mines have generally established worker security teams, and a few units also use "night watch shifts" that are separated from production; however, relying on all employees and mobilizing everyone to protect the factory is still far from enough, and there is still paralysis. In June, among the twenty units under the Municipal Enterprise Bureau, there were as many as twelve unfortunate incidents such as fires and car accidents, five of which occurred in the Mentougou Coal Mine. Some responsible cadres in the unit still believe that "no one can guarantee that nothing will happen" regarding factory security work, lacking the spirit of courage and responsibility for the people's enterprise.
    In response to the existing problems in various units, the Municipal Enterprise Bureau emphasized when deploying work in July that, based on the initial experience of the Tram Company's democratic movement, various units should launch criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom in July, have the courage to accept hundreds of opinions, and go through the steps of the democratic movement to inspect leadership, discuss production, establish management committees, and establish and improve a strict cost accounting system. This includes: (1) Rationally organizing labor. (2) Democratically discussing and determining individual production standards and specifications. (3) Saving raw materials and fuel, cherishing factories, utilizing waste materials, and carrying out conservation campaigns. Based on the specific situation, each mine and factory should propose guarantee conditions to prevent sabotage; and various units should also be required to propose draft production systems and strengthen business, political, and technical learning.

### 平市各厂矿集会　总结六月份工作  生产大部按计划完成　七月份要开展民主运动

　　平市各厂矿集会
  　总结六月份工作
    生产大部按计划完成
  　七月份要开展民主运动
    【本报讯】北平市人民政府企业局于七月四、五两日召集所属门头沟、城子、西山三大公营煤矿及电车公司、自来水公司等二十个单位的军事代表、经理（或厂长）开会，并邀请各厂、矿支部书记、工会主任参加。会议总结了六月份工作，并确定七月份工作重点为开展民主运动，建立工厂管理委员会；树立和健全严格的成本核算制度，开展节约运动，进一步加强工厂保卫工作。
    各厂、矿六月份大部按照生产计划完成了生产任务，有的单位也超过了五月份生产数字。初步克服了生产工作上的盲目性，并开始注意了民主管理及保卫工作。自来水公司由五月份的三万二千一百十一个用户，增到三万二千四百六十个用户。燕京造纸厂五月份平均每日产纸二百四十令，六月份增到日产纸二百五十令，质量也保持四十磅左右的标准。清河制呢厂于六月二十日全面恢复生产，在修复期间，棉织部六月份织出花布较原计划超过了四千余米，毛织部产量也超过了原计划。该厂并提出计时、计工、计料的成本核算制度。第二酱油厂因用麦皮、豆饼代替了高粱、豆子，成本减低一倍。新建玻璃厂经多次教育，克服了原有的守旧观念。门头沟、西山、城子煤矿，六月份都大力进行了防水工程，预计七月十日前可全部完成。其他如第一酱油厂等单位产量较五月份都有提高。北京机器窑厂、新建窑厂大台、城子煤矿六月份都进行了厂房修建、整修机器等恢复工作。
    市企业局在六月初即已布置各厂、矿试行经营企业化和工厂管理民主化并加强工厂的保卫工作，但各厂在贯彻这一工作时，尚不彻底。在经营上，部分工厂存在着成本过高和成品没销路的现象。燕京造纸厂六月份的产量虽已超过五月份，但成本并未实际减低。据企业局调查结果，燕京造纸厂每令纸的成本是一千五百一十二元，某私营纸厂每令成本是一千四百五十元，每令即相差六十二元。门头沟煤矿在改革几项制度以前，虽然每月产量不断提高，但成本也是与月俱增。六月份每吨煤成本较私营小窑高出小米十余斤。成本增高的同时，产品并未及时推销出去。燕京造纸厂两月生产大批存纸，不能卖出，门头沟等三个煤矿已存煤九万多吨，堆上加堆，矿厂感觉再也没地方存放了。有的矿厂对经营企业化还未认真施行，某些单位的某些人员对人民财产表现不负责的态度，如城子煤矿在采购生铁时，不加仔细调查即行采购，结果花二十一万元买一吨生铁，而同样生铁在北平用十六万元，在天津用八、九万元即可买到。
    实行企业民主管理的问题，五月份市企业局就对各单位进行了布置，六月份除电车公司一个单位外，各厂、矿大部未很好的贯彻。电车公司于六月二十二日开始，在市委、市职工总会帮助下从整顿工会、整顿党群关系入手，召开了临时职工代表会议。工会、行政都做了自我检讨，并发动职工提出意见，开展了民主改革运动。在运动中连多年不参加任何会议的老工友也说出了心里的话。现工人中已有建立工厂管理委员会的要求。但多数矿、厂的民主运动还没有开展起来，有的工厂仅仅是进行了形式主义的宣传，并没从开展民主运动着手。如城子煤矿，只由职工会宣教部聘请了许多干事，到十一个职工小组中去领导学习工厂民主管理问题，等到领导认为“学习可以了”，就了草的由各组选举出职工代表。又如新建玻璃厂、新建窑厂等单位，干部思想上对于开展民主运动，建立管委会，单纯强调客观困难。他们认为，工人劳动时间长，没法进行教育，工作有季节性，流动性大，工人对工厂感情不密切等。有的工厂则是比较满足于自己已有的民主成绩，也有的虽然建立了管委会，但还有些问题没解决，如自来水公司管委会已成立了一个月，但职工代表会尚未健全起来。
    在保卫工厂安全的工作上，市企业局几次指示各厂、矿提高警惕，现各厂、矿已普遍建立了工人保卫队，也有少数单位用脱离生产的“打更班”；但依靠全体职工，发动大家保卫工厂的工作还很不够，并仍然存在着麻痹现象。六月份市企业局所属二十单位中，发生失火、撞车等不幸事件十二起之多，其中有五起发生在门头沟煤矿。有的单位负责干部对工厂保卫工作，还认为“谁也不敢担保不出事”，缺乏对人民企业勇敢负责的精神。
    针对各单位现存的问题，市企业局在布置七月份工作时着重提出，根据电车公司民主运动的初步经验，各单位要在七月份自上而下的展开批评与自我批评，要具备接受几百条意见的勇气，要经过民主运动的步骤，检查领导，讨论生产，成立管委会，树立和健全严格的成本核算制度。其中包括：（一）合理组织劳动力。（二）民主讨论确定个人生产标准及规格。（三）节省原料、燃料，爱护工厂、利用废物、开展节约运动。根据具体情况，各矿、厂提出保证条件，防止破坏；并要求各单位提出各种生产制度草案，加强业务、政治及技术的学习。
