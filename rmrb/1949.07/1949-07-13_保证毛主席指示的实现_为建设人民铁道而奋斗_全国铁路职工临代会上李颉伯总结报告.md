　　To guarantee the realization of Chairman Mao's instructions
　　Strive to build People's Railways
　　Li Jiebo's Summary Report at the National Railway Workers' Provisional Representative Conference
　　[Ping City News] At the National Railway Workers' Provisional Representative Conference on the 8th, Comrade Li Jiebo, Director of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Railway Workers' Committee, made a summary report, which is excerpted as follows:
　　I. During the three days of discussion, all delegation members unanimously accepted the instructions of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Comrade Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, Comrade Lin Boqu, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Bo Yibo, Secretary of the North China Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Ye Jianying, Mayor of Beiping, Comrade Li Lisan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Comrade Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League; and unanimously agreed with the reports of Comrade Teng Daiyuan and Comrade Lü Zhengcao of the Ministry of Railways and Comrade Li Lisan; and basically agreed with the draft of the Railway General Trade Union Charter and the draft of the Factory Management Committee, fully demonstrating the spirit of unity of railway employees across the country.
　　Comrade Teng Daiyuan's report on the current situation and tasks can serve as a concrete program for our railway workers to strive for. We are united in fighting against the oppression and exploitation of imperialist aggression, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and in striving to build a new democratic China, supporting the New Political Consultative Conference, and supporting the central government of the People's Democratic Republic of China, which is about to be established. To this end, we will make every effort to support the People's Liberation War for an early victory. With the spirit of "sweating more in the rear and bleeding less at the front," we will ensure that wherever the army fights, the railway will be built, and the train will run. Overcome all difficulties to restore the national railways and prepare to build new railways to consolidate national defense, develop production, and prosper the economy, and guarantee the realization of the task assigned to us by Chairman Mao to build People's Railways. Comrade Lü Zhengcao's report serves as our guideline for implementing the responsibility system, improving production, and improving operations. Educate employees, raise awareness, overcome conservative ideas, eliminate the bad habit of blindly worshiping Britain and the United States, learn from the advanced Soviet theory and practical experience, take the Northeast as an example, promote the enthusiasm of employees, and launch a competition campaign to improve the operations of all railways in China.
　　According to Comrade Li Lisan's report, we must quickly and extensively organize, educate, and unite employees, implement the principle of "everyone running the trade union," promote the spirit of hard struggle, and appropriately organize welfare work, care for the immediate interests of employees, but must prevent the tendency of economism and guildism. Promote democratization of factory management and run factories well.
　　Learn from the Northeast Labor Movement Experience
　　Implement the Principle of "Everyone Running the Trade Union"
　　II. The Northeast railway labor movement has achieved great success, manifested in: restoring all railways under the most difficult conditions and reforming the railway administration. This is due to the correct leadership of the Party, government, and army in the Northeast, the employees' high level of political awareness, labor enthusiasm, and consistent efforts from top to bottom, and the acceptance of advanced Soviet experience. These three elements are closely linked and indispensable. Therefore, railway employees across the country should learn from the Northeast.
　　The Northeast also had tortuous and memorable experiences, which Comrade Lü Zhengcao pointed out—the initial labor movement activities that were divorced from production operations and detrimental to production, the conservative attitude of some people toward advanced Soviet theories, and the shortcoming of not paying attention to the immediate interests of employees for a period of time. These have hindered work. In the future, the Northeast trade union work should pay attention to: 1. Deepen trade union organizational work and implement the principle of "everyone running the trade union." 2. Continue to strengthen education work. 3. Appropriately establish labor insurance and welfare undertakings. 4. Discover and cultivate typical examples and promote competition activities widely and regularly.
　　Use this specific and practical work to ensure the continuous improvement and enhancement of production operations, and consolidate and develop the exemplary role in the country. Therefore, there should be a more humble spirit of learning.
　　Specific Work in New Areas
　　III. Regarding the work in the new areas, the following specific work should be done in accordance with the line of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and the instructions of Comrade Shaoqi.
　　1. Should meet the legitimate and feasible demands of employees according to the actual situation. Such as dealing with bad elements with notorious records, reasonable adjustment of personnel, reasonable adjustment of institutions, taking care of casualties, evaluating wages, evaluating functions, and maintaining certain living welfare. These demands are generally reasonable and beneficial to both public and private interests. For reasonable demands that cannot be met temporarily, adopt a persuasive attitude, and for conditions that have to be lowered in difficult circumstances, ask for understanding. 2. Organize employees: The strength of the working class is manifested in the working class having organization and discipline. Lenin said: "The strength of the working class lies first in having organization, and second in having organization." Relying on the working-class organization is manifested in relying on the trade union. Therefore, we should quickly and extensively organize. 3. Step up the education of employees, use all methods and strive to do this work, implement class education, education on the basic problems of the Chinese revolution, and policy education; and improve the political awareness of employees. 4. Staff issues: Adopt the policy of striving for unity and transformation.
　　IV. Regarding the issue of democratization of factory management:
　　1. Whether the station/section management committee is needed should be left to the preparatory committee for research. Existing ones should not be cancelled but should be well tested to gain experience, and those that do not exist can be tested in one or two stations/sections. 2. The management committee is the highest administrative management institution of the factory, but it must maintain the final decision-making power of the factory director, otherwise it will become an anarchic state under certain circumstances.
　　V. Charter issues:
　　1. Organizing by point or by line has its own advantages and disadvantages. Now there is not enough experience and reason to deny one of them, so we all agree to collect experience before making a decision. However, it must be pointed out that in the new areas where the masses have not yet been mobilized, the organization by point is appropriate. 2. Regarding the trade union at the level of the sub-bureau, it is appropriate to set up an office to avoid too many election affairs. And the sub-bureau-level trade union mainly handles affairs according to the decisions of the administration bureau trade union. However, it must be pointed out that the office should have a system of regularly convening meetings of subordinate trade unions to promote democracy. Before the representative conference, sub-bureau trade unions that already exist will remain temporarily, pending the final decision of the conference. For newly established sub-bureaus, organize offices. 3. Railway police and railway corps are national armed organizations and do not organize trade unions. 4. The "should have certain membership procedures" in the charter refers to being voluntary, having an introduction, acknowledging the charter, obeying resolutions, and registering. Under these conditions, widely absorb in accordance with the charter. 5. Relationship with local trade unions: decided by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, but it must be pointed out that it should be closely united with local trade unions.
　　VI. Regarding the Youth League issue: Young employees are the most active, the most energetic, and the most receptive to new things and new theories. The Youth League is an advanced youth organization, and we should unanimously support their work and maintain their advanced role.

　　保证毛主席指示的实现
  　为建设人民铁道而奋斗
    全国铁路职工临代会上李颉伯总结报告
    【平市讯】在八日全国铁路职工临时代表会议上，全总铁路工委会主任李颉伯同志作总结报告，兹摘要如下：
    一、各代表团在三天的讨论中，一致接受朱总司令，华北人民政府主席董必武同志，中共中央委员林伯渠同志，中共华北局书记薄一波同志，北平市长叶剑英同志，全总副主席李立三同志及新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬同志的指示，与一致同意铁道部滕代远同志、吕正操同志及李立三同志的报告；并基本同意铁路总工会章程草案，工厂管理委员会草案，充分表现着全国铁路员工一致团结的精神。
    滕代远同志的目前形势与任务的报告，可以作为我们铁路职工具体奋斗的纲领，我们一致为打倒帝国主义侵略，封建主义，官僚资本主义的压迫和剥削，与为建设新民主主义的新中国而奋斗，拥护新政治协商会议，拥护即将成立的中华人民民主共和国的中央政府。为此，我们用一切努力为支援人民解放战争及早胜利而奋斗。用后方多流汗，前方少流血的精神，保证军队打到哪里，铁路修到哪里，火车就通到哪里。克服一切困难，为恢复全国铁路，并准备建设新铁路，以此来巩固国防，发展生产，繁荣经济，保证毛主席指示给我们建设人民铁道的任务得以实现。以吕正操同志的报告作为我们推行负责制，提高生产改善业务的方针。教育职工，提高觉悟，克服保守思想，排除盲目崇拜英美的恶习，学习苏联先进的理论与实际的经验，以东北的范例，发扬职工的热情，展开竞赛运动来改进全中国所有铁路的业务。
    根据李立三同志的报告，迅速广泛的组织、教育、团结职工，贯彻大家办工会的方针，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，而又要适当的组织福利工作，关心职工切身利益，但必须防止经济主义及行会主义的倾向。推行工厂管理民主化，办好工厂。
  　学习东北工运经验
    贯彻大家办工会方针
    二、东北铁路职工运动是有伟大成绩的，表现在：在最困难的条件下，恢复了全部铁路，并改革了路政，这是由于在东北党政军的正确领导下，员工高度的政治觉悟，劳动热情，和上下一致努力与接受苏联先进经验的结果。三个要素是密切结合着的，缺一不可。因此，全国铁路职工都应向东北学习。
    东北也曾有过曲折的，且必须记取的经验，就是吕正操同志所指出的——初期脱离生产业务的、于生产不利的工运活动，部分人对苏联先进理论的保守态度和在一个时期不重视职工切身利益的缺点。这些都曾妨碍过工作。今后东北工会工作应当注意：１、深入工会组织工作，贯彻大家办工会的方针。２、继续加强教育工作。３、适当建立劳动保险福利事业。４、更多发现并培养爱护典型，并广泛经常推行竞赛运动。
    以此具体实际工作来保障生产业务不断的改进与提高，巩固与发展在全国示范的作用。因此，应有更加虚心学习的精神。
    新区具体工作
    三、关于新区工作，应该依据二中全会的路线及少奇同志的指示，作如下的具体工作。
    １、应根据实际情况满足职工正当而可行的要求。如处理劣迹昭彰的坏分子，合理的调整人事，合理的调整机构，照顾伤亡、评议工资，评议职能，维持一定生活福利，这些要求一般是合理而与公私有利的。对于合理而一时办不到的要求则采取说服的态度，对于在困难情况下不得不降低的条件，则请求谅解。２、组织职工：工人阶级有力量，表现在工人阶级有组织有纪律，列宁说：“工人阶级之有力量第一在有组织，第二还是在有组织。”依靠工人阶级组织，表现于依靠工会，因此，应迅速广泛的组织起来。３、加紧教育职工，用一切方法并尽力作此工作，实行阶级教育，中国革命基本问题的教育，政策教育；提高职工政治觉悟。４、职员问题：采取争取团结改造的方针。
    四、关于工厂管理民主化的问题：
    １、站段管理委员会是否需要，交给筹委会研究。已有的不取消应很好的实验，取得经验，没有的可择一二站段试验。２、管理委员会是厂的最高行政管理机构，但必须保持厂长最后决定权，否则在一定情况下会变成无政府状态。
    五、章程问题：
    １、按点或按线组织各有优缺点，现在还没有足够的经验和理由否定其中之一个，所以我们都承认先搜集经验再做决定。但必须指出在新区群众尚未发动起来时，则以点的组织为宜。２、关于分局一层工会，则以设办事处为宜，以免选举事务太多。且分局一层工会主要是根据管理局工会的决定办事。但必须指出办事处应有定期召集所属工会会议制度，以发扬民主。在代表大会前，现在已有分局工会者，仍暂存在，以待大会最后决定。新设分局则组织办事处。３、路警和铁道兵团是国家武装组织，不组织工会。４、章程上的“应有一定的入会手续”，是指自愿、要有介绍、承认章程、服从决议、登记而言。在此条件下照章广泛吸收。５、与地方工会关系问题：由全总决定，但必须指出应与地方工会密切团结。
    六、关于青年团问题：青年职工表现的最积极，最有生气，最容易接受新鲜事物和新的理论，青年团是先进的青年组织，我们应一致赞助他们的工作，保持其先进作用。
