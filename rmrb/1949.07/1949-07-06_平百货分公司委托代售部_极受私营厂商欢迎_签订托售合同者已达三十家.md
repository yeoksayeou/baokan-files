　　Ping Department Store Branch's Commissioned Sales Department
    Is Extremely Popular with Private Manufacturers
  　Thirty Contracts Have Been Signed
    [Our Newspaper] The Ping Trading Company's Department Store Branch has established a commissioned sales department to help private manufacturers promote their products. At the beginning of this venture, it has already been welcomed by some private manufacturers. In order to restore and develop the city's industrial production, in addition to supporting the cigarette, soap, and knitwear industries through the exchange of raw materials for finished products, the branch established a commissioned sales department in late June to assist private manufacturers in promoting their products and solving their sales problems. At the beginning of this business, thirty factories, including China Hygiene Toothbrush Factory, Hu Kaiwen and Dai Yuexuan Writing Brush Shop, Wenfeng Women's Handicraft Factory, Chunhe Sporting Goods Store, and Allen Pharmaceutical Factory, have signed contracts to entrust more than one hundred kinds of their products to the commissioned sales department for promotion. Dozens of manufacturers producing medicines, rubber, etc. are also in the process of entrusting sales. The reason why private manufacturers are willing to participate in this kind of consignment is mainly because state-owned trade agencies have excellent credit and charge low handling fees. At the same time, consignment sales can indeed solve the sales problem for some of their products. In addition to selling the commissioned goods at the Wangfujing Street store, the department store branch can also transfer them in large quantities to other places. For example, the Shouzibai brand toothbrushes entrusted by the China Hygiene Toothbrush Factory have been sold to Inner Mongolia and western Liaoning Province, totaling more than 1,000 dozens. In addition, the toothpaste produced by Xinmin Industrial Chemical Factory, the children's socks produced by Zhongya Family Industrial Cooperative, and the tablecloths and pillowcases produced by Wenfeng Family Industrial Cooperative have all been promoted to some extent. Due to the consignment sales of the department store branch, some manufacturers' long-standing stockpiles of products have been sold, prompting their production to become more active. According to the manager of China Hygiene Toothbrush Factory, this kind of consignment is of great help to private manufacturers. More than 800 dozens of goods that had been stockpiled since last winter due to sluggish sales were cleared out at once and were still insufficient. (Yu)

　　平百货分公司委托代售部
    极受私营厂商欢迎
  　签订托售合同者已达三十家
    【本报讯】平贸易公司百货分公司创设委托代售部，帮助私营厂商推销产品，在开始之初已受到一部私营厂商的欢迎。该分公司为恢复与发展本市工业生产，除了以原料交换成品方式扶植卷烟、肥皂、针织等业外，复于六月下旬创设委托代售部，协助私营厂商推销产品，解决他们的销路问题。在这一业务开始之初，已有中国卫生牙刷工厂、胡开文及戴月轩笔墨庄、文丰妇女手工厂、春和体育用品社、爱伦药厂等三十家工厂签定合同，把他们的产品百余种委托代销部推销。正在托售的尚有制造药品、橡胶等数十家厂商。各私营厂商之所以愿意参加此种托售，主要是国营贸易机关信用卓著，及所收手续费低廉，同时经过托售，确能解决他们一部分产品销路问题。百货分公司对委托代售的货品除在王府井大街门市部售卖外，并可大量向外调剂，如中国卫生牙刷工厂托售的寿字牌牙刷经该公司推销先后卖给内蒙、辽西省共一千余打，另外替新民实业化工社出产的牙粉，中亚家庭工业社的童袜、文丰家庭工业社的台布、枕套等均推销出一部。由于百货分公司的托售代销，把一些厂商历来积压的产品给推销出去，促使他们的生产趋于活跃，据中国卫生牙刷工厂经理表示：这种托售对私营厂商的帮助太大了，他们厂里由去冬因滞销而积压的八百多打货一次出清还不足。　（宇）
