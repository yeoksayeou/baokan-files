　　Overcoming Various Disasters to Complete Late Crop Planting
　　North China Actively Weeding Seedlings
    Taiyuan Sends Cadres and Technicians to the Countryside for Guidance
    [Comprehensive News from This Newspaper] Since late June and early July, most areas in North China have experienced successive thorough rains. While harvesting wheat, eliminating locusts, and removing pests, various localities have successively completed the late crop planting on wheat stubble fields and have simultaneously launched an intensive weeding and topdressing fertilizer campaign. By early July, in the plains areas of eastern Hebei, spring seedlings had generally been weeded twice and cultivated once, with some areas even weeded three or four times. In the process of planting late crops and weeding seedlings, over 1,005,000 mu of neglected and uncultivated land was inspected and eliminated. In central and southern Hebei, spring seedlings have generally been weeded twice, and special crops such as cotton and peanuts have mostly been weeded three times, with some weeded up to five times. In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, severe drought persisted in June, and the area vigorously carried out drought-resistant planting and replanting. In early July, rainfall occurred throughout the region, but some areas still experienced small and dry land. After the thorough rain, a rush planting of late crops was undertaken, which is now largely completed. Spring seedlings have also been weeded twice in conjunction with the weeding. In eastern and western Suiyuan, rainfall was insufficient in June. Through leadership-led planting and rush planting, most of the cultivated land has been sown, and the sown area exceeds that of last year. The masses are now being mobilized to pull weeds and thin seedlings for the first weeding. In the mountainous Taihang area, including counties such as Zuoquan, Huguan, Lucheng, Pingshun, and Yushe, the fourth special district of Chahar Ping, and areas such as Xuanhua and Longguan, the Jincheng and Yangcheng areas of Taiyue, and the Jiexiu, Yu County, and Qi County areas of Taiyuan, spring seedlings have all been weeded once by early July, with some weeded twice. Late wheat stubble crops and small seedlings replanted after drought and hail disasters have all emerged, and the first thinning and weeding is beginning. A few places have completed the first weeding. This year, the leadership of weeding in various regions has been greatly improved compared to previous years. Initially, the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government issued a call to strengthen the leadership of weeding work, and the leading organs of various regions gave specific instructions to counties, districts, and villages. Many areas put forward: "Weeding is the overriding central task." The Taiyuan Municipal Agricultural Bureau organized cadres and technicians to go to the countryside for inspection to provide farmers with practical help and guidance. The disaster-stricken people in the suburbs of Taiyuan lacked food, which affected summer weeding. The municipal government specially distributed a portion of relief grain. Jianping County in Chahar lent 55,000 catties of rice to farmers lacking food through the county cooperative, so that everyone could participate in weeding. Eastern Hebei widely promoted the use of weeding hoes, and the Qianxi County government loaned more than 200 new-style weeding hoes. During the weeding, all localities vigorously mobilized women and promoted mutual aid in weeding labor. In some villages in Laishui, Chahar, the number of male and female farmers participating in mutual aid weeding reached more than 90%. Mutual aid has also been developed in the new districts. In Qianxi, 60% of the women participated in weeding. Since the weeding season is also the best season for suppressing green manure and increasing topdressing fertilizer, southern Hebei, central Hebei, and Taihang are launching a campaign to accumulate fertilizer and apply topdressing fertilizer. In the fourth district of Huguan, Taihang, 32 villages accumulated more than 640,000 dan of fertilizer in 20 days, and each mu of seedlings can be applied with about 10 dan of topdressing fertilizer. In terms of leadership, the Pingding County Party Committee in Taiyuan proposed, "Bring the work to the fields!" and lead production in production together with the farmers.

　　战胜各种灾害完成晚苗播种
  　华北各地紧张锄苗
    太原派干部与技术人员下乡指导
    【本报综合消息】华北绝大部分地区自六月下旬至七月初先后普降透雨，各地在麦收、灭蝗、除虫等劳作中，陆续完成麦茬地晚苗播种，同时展开紧张的锄苗、上追肥运动。至七月初，平原地区冀东的春苗已普遍锄过二遍，耘过一遍，部分地区且锄过三遍或四遍。并在播种晚苗与锄苗中，检查消灭生荒熟荒一百万零五千余亩。冀中、冀南春苗已普锄二遍，棉花、花生等特种作物大部锄过三遍，有的已锄过五遍。冀鲁豫六月亢旱无雨，该区曾大力进行了抗旱点种与补种。七月初全区落雨，但少数地方仍然雨小地干。透雨后即突击抢种晚苗，现已大体完成。春苗结合锄过了二遍。绥东、绥西六月间雨水不足，经领导点种抢种，耕地已大部下种，播种面积超过了去年，现正发动群众拔草定苗锄头遍。山地太行区左权、壶关、潞城、平顺、榆社等县，察哈尔平四专区及宣化、龙关等地，太岳区晋城、阳城，太原区介休、盂县、祁县等地，春苗七月初均已锄过头遍，有的锄过二遍，各区麦茬晚苗及旱、雹灾后补种之小苗，均已出齐，正开始间苗锄头遍。少数地方已锄完头遍。今年各区对锄苗的领导，较往年有很大改进。开始，华北人民政府农业部即发出了加强领导锄苗工作的号召，各区领导机关都向县、区、村做了具体的指示。许多地区提出：“锄苗是压倒一切的中心任务”。太原市农业局，曾组织干部、技术人员下乡检查，给农民以实际的帮助指导。太原市郊灾民无口粮，影响夏锄，市府特发放一部救济粮。察哈尔建屏县由县联社贷给缺口粮的农民以五万五千斤米，使大家都投入了锄苗。冀东普遍提倡使用耘锄，迁西县政府贷出新式耘锄二百余张。锄苗中，各地都大力发动了妇女，提倡锄苗劳动互助。察哈尔涞水有些村庄参加互助锄苗的男女农民达到百分之九十以上。新区互助也有开展。迁西参加锄苗妇女达百分之六十。因锄苗季节又是最好的压绿肥增加追肥的季节，冀南、冀中、太行等地正在发动积肥上追肥运动。太行壶关四区三十二个村，二十天积肥六十四万余担，每亩苗可施追肥十担左右。在领导上，太原区平定县委提出“把工作带到地里做去！”跟农民一起，在生产中领导生产。
