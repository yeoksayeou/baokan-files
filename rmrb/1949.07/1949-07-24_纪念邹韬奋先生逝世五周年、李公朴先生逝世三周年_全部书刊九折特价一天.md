Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the Death of Mr. Zou Taofen and the Third Anniversary of the Death of Mr. Li Gongpu
	All Books and Publications are Discounted by 10% for One Day
　　This year, July 24th marks the fifth anniversary of Mr. Zou Taofen's death, and July 12th marks the third anniversary of Mr. Li Gongpu's martyrdom. Throughout their lives, Mr. Zou and Mr. Li devoted themselves to the democratic movement and engaged in cultural work, founding the Life Bookstore and Dushu Publishing House (Note: Now the Life, Reading, and New Knowledge Bookstore is combined to form the New China Bookstore), establishing a solid foundation for the revolutionary cultural publishing cause. Now that the two gentlemen have passed away successively, on this memorial day, we cherish the memory of our predecessors and sincerely strive and encourage ourselves to work hard for the New Democratic cultural publishing cause. We hope for your kind attention.
