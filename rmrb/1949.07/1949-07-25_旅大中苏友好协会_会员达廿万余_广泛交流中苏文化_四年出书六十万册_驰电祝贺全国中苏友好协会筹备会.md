Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 24th: The Lüshun-Dalian area China-Soviet Friendship Association, since its establishment four years ago, has developed into a large-scale mass organization, making great contributions to enhancing the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. Currently, the association's membership throughout the region has reached 202,244, with workers being the most numerous, followed by farmers. There are a total of 763 branch associations, including 170 in factories and enterprises. Organizations have also been widely established in rural areas. Over the past four years, the Lüda China-Soviet Friendship Association has extensively engaged in activities to exchange Chinese and Soviet culture. The Friendship Bookstore affiliated with the association has published over 600,000 copies of books introducing the Soviet Union, as well as 89 kinds of magazines such as "China-Soviet Knowledge," "Friendship Pictorial," and "Friendship Bi-monthly." Mobile film teams introducing the Soviet Union regularly go deep into various streets and rural areas to screen Soviet films, with a total audience of over two million people. To help the vast membership learn from the Soviet Union, the association's club has held ten reading groups and 35 various study classes. In addition, it has held 17 sessions of Russian language schools, with over 1,100 participants. Through the activities of the China-Soviet Friendship Association, the understanding and friendship between the one million people in the Lüda area and the Soviet troops stationed there, as well as Soviet expatriates, are growing day by day.

Also reported: After the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the National China-Soviet Friendship Association, the Lüda China-Soviet Friendship Association sent a congratulatory telegram. The telegram stated:

　　The Soviet Red Army directly liberated our Lüda area and, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, stationed troops in Lüshun to personally protect the peace and security of our region. For more than three years, with the help of the Soviet army, our Lüda area has been able to overcome various difficulties, and economic and cultural development has steadily progressed. At the same time, the cause of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people in Lüda has a deep foundation and is becoming increasingly consolidated and developed. We firmly believe that in the future, under the leadership of the soon-to-be-established National China-Soviet Friendship Association, the work of the Lüda Friendship Association will definitely have greater and better development.

    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】旅（顺）大（连）地区中苏友好协会成立四年以来，已发展成为一大规模的群众性的组织，在增进中苏两大民族的友谊上有着很大的贡献。现全区中苏友好协会会员已达二十万二千二百四十四名，其中工人最多，农民次之。全区共有七百六十三个分、支会，其中工厂企业的分、支会有一百七十个。农村也普遍建立了组织。四年来旅大中苏友好协会广泛地进行了交流中苏文化的活动。该会所属友谊书店出版了近六十余万册介绍苏联的书籍，及“中苏知识”、“友谊画报”、“友谊半月刊”等八十九种杂志。介绍苏联的流动电影队，经常深入各街道及农村，出演苏联名片，总计观众达二百万人之多。为了帮助广大会员向苏联学习，该会俱乐部曾举办了十期读书会，各种学习班三十五个。另举办俄文学校十七期，参加学习者达一千一百多人。通过中苏友好协会的活动，旅大地区的一百万人民与苏联驻军及苏联侨民相互间的了解与友谊日益增进。
    又讯：全国中苏友好协会筹备会成立后，旅大中苏友好协会特电致贺。电文称：
    苏联红军直接解放了我们旅大地区，又根据中苏友好同盟条约驻军旅顺，亲自保卫了我们这地区的和平安全。三年多以来，在苏军的帮助下我们旅大地区得以克服了种种困难，经济文化等各项建设获得不断地发展。与此同时，旅大中苏人民友谊事业，也有了深厚的基础，而且正在日益巩固发展。我们坚信，今后在即将成立的全国中苏友好协会的领导下，旅大友协的工作定会有更大更好的发展。
