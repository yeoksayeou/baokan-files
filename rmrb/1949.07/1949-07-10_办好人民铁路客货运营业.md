　　Run People's Railways Passenger and Freight Business Well
    The Railway Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission recently promulgated the "National Railway Passenger and Freight Tariffs," "Cargo Classification," "Cargo Technical Regulations Loading Capacity," "Passenger Tariff and Miscellaneous Fee Calculation Rules," "Freight Tariff and Miscellaneous Fee Calculation Rules," and the currently provisional "Cargo Transportation Rules and Supplementary Rules," and "Passenger Baggage and Parcel Transportation Rules and Supplementary Rules." The promulgation of these rules and tariff rates is of great significance for the rapid transition of the national railway passenger and freight business to unified management.
    The unification of the people's railway passenger and freight tariffs and transportation rules may seem like a small matter, but it is actually the result of decades of people's revolutionary struggle. The history of Chinese railways is now eighty-one years old. These eighty-one years of railway history are essentially the history of division and monopoly by various imperialists and Chinese feudal bureaucratic capitalists. Imperialists and bureaucratic capitalists each dominated their own areas, so Chinese railways never had unified tariffs or unified regulations. We remember that in the past, the connecting Beijing-Shanghai, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Guangdong-Hankou, Zhengtai, and Tongpu railways, which were connected to each other, had different passenger and freight tariffs and regulations. Traveling or consigning goods from the Beijing-Shanghai or Tongpu railways to other connected railways required re-ticketing; on the bureau side, for inter-bureau joint transportation, the freight charges had to be settled mutually. How inconvenient and labor-intensive this was for passengers and cargo owners! But from today onwards, this kind of non-unified phenomenon will never exist again.
    The various field armies of the People's Liberation Army are conducting the largest march in Chinese history towards the southern and northwestern provinces, and the complete liberation of the country is not far off. Developing production, prospering the economy, and transforming our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country will become the focus of all our work. And to develop production and prosper the economy, we need a large amount of raw materials and finished products to be transported. We need to safely transport a large amount of raw materials to factories and mines, and safely transport a large amount of finished products to various markets. Therefore, it is extremely important to run the people's railway passenger and freight business well. Railways and cargo owners should guarantee to organize planned transportation and complete the state's passenger and freight transportation plan with the least possible consumption of transportation materials. At the same time, the railway's tariff policy should be well coordinated and mastered, that is to say, in coordination with our country's overall economic policy, and in accordance with what materials are needed, what is advocated, what is rewarded, what is not needed, and what is restricted in a certain region and at a certain time, appropriate tariffs should be set. We oppose the purely profit-making viewpoint in railway business, and at the same time, we also oppose the viewpoint of lacking development. The tariff regulations promulgated by the Railway Department this time are based on this principle.
    First of all, considerable improvements have been made in the classification of goods. In the past, the northern bureaus only divided goods into five grades, and the Northeast only divided them into ten grades. However, the advanced socialist country, the Soviet Union, has already divided the goods transported into one hundred and ten grades. Our objective conditions are naturally still far from those of the Soviet Union, so our initial reform is to divide the goods into twenty grades. The more appropriately the goods are divided into grades, the more reasonable it is, because appropriately dividing the grades not only makes it easier for the goods to bear the tariffs reasonably, but also makes it easier to implement the state's economic policies of rewarding and advocating or restricting certain goods.
    The ratio of the difference between the tariffs of each grade of goods is also closely related to the burden of the goods on the tariffs. In the past, during the Kuomintang rule, goods were divided into five grades, and the first grade was five point zero six times that of the fifth grade. Such a grade difference ratio made it very cheap to transport first and second grade products such as luxury goods, cosmetics, and non-essential goods, while transporting large quantities of essential goods for people's livelihood was relatively expensive. This set of methods was unfavorable to the broad working people and favorable to the exploiting classes. In this area, we have taken revolutionary improvements. This time, the tariff stipulates that the first grade is two hundred times higher than the twentieth grade. We set the tariff for the 18th grade goods according to the direct transportation cost planned by the Northeast in 1949. In order to develop industry and take care of the daily necessities of the people's livelihood, we have listed industrial necessities and people's livelihood necessities as close as possible to the direct cost grade, and necessary materials such as coal and various mineral sands are placed below the direct transportation cost grade. In order to make the industrial plant site close to the raw material production area, promote regional division of labor, and create a rational use of transportation capacity, we have also placed the grades of finished products and raw materials close to each other. In order to subsidize cultural and educational undertakings, educational supplies, books, and magazines are also listed in lower grades. However, luxury goods, valuables, and non-essential goods are raised in grade to restrict them. It is right to divide the goods into twenty grades this time, but whether the arrangement of each kind of goods in the twenty grades is appropriate still needs to be investigated and studied by the broad masses of people in future practical work, and we hope to provide opinions for future corrections.
    In the past, during the Kuomintang rule, because each road was self-governing, some stipulated the method of decreasing tariffs with distance, and some did not. The degree of reduction was also inconsistent for those who stipulated the reduction. In order to encourage the long-distance transportation of goods, it is essential to adopt the method of decreasing tariffs with distance. Today, the new tariffs have been completely and thoroughly reformed. The new tariffs stipulate that there is no reduction within 100 kilometers of cargo transportation; from 101 kilometers to 400 kilometers, 0.03 kilometers of the operating kilometer is reduced for every 10 kilometers; from 401 kilometers to 1000 kilometers, 0.05 kilometers of the operating kilometer is reduced for every 10 kilometers; from 1001 kilometers to 2000 kilometers, 0.06 kilometers of the operating kilometer is reduced for every 10 kilometers. According to this degree of reduction, the freight charged for transporting 1000 kilometers is 57.4 percent of the non-decreasing freight, that is to say, 42.6 percent less than the non-decreasing freight. In addition to the stipulated method of decreasing tariffs with distance, specific tariffs have also been set. For example, sorghum rice, corn, and soybean oil sent from stations south of the customs under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Railway Administration are reduced by 50 percent. In addition, special prices have also been set for timber, construction cement, coal, and certain materials entering and exiting through several designated stations. The formulation of this special price is in line with the new democratic economic policy of developing production and prospering the economy.
    The passenger and freight transportation rules and supplementary rules promulgated this time clearly stipulate the rights and obligations between railway cargo owners. Today, the management of people's railways must be responsible to the broad masses of the people. It must prevent all possible waste or bad phenomena. For example, it is now stipulated that during the delivery period of goods, luggage, and parcels, if the railway does not deliver on time, the railway will be fined two-thirtieths of the freight amount for each day of delay for luggage; one-thirtieth of the freight amount for each day of delay for parcels; and 2 percent to 4 percent of the freight amount for each day of delay for goods. At the same time, the compensation standard for goods, luggage, and parcels is also stipulated. If the goods are damaged due to the reasons of the railway, the railway will compensate according to the market price at the destination station; if the cargo owner is willing to compensate the same physical object, the railway will compensate the same physical object. These provisions are fair and reasonable. The Kuomintang's railways did not have this kind of provision in the past, nor would it have this kind of provision. This distinction shows how much today's railways attach importance to the interests of cargo owners and how they put the rights of the people first. This practice not only provides a reliable guarantee for the goods consigned by cargo owners, but also strengthens the sense of responsibility of the personnel handling railway business, and further improves the efficiency and credibility of railway transportation. On the other hand, the rules also strictly stipulate the planned transportation and the fines to be paid by the cargo owners. The obligation rules stipulate fines for delayed freight cars. If the freight car is delayed due to the reasons of the cargo owner, the delay is fined 30 yuan of people's currency per ton per hour for one hour to six hours, and 60 yuan of people's currency per ton per hour for seven hours to twelve hours, and then doubles progressively for every six hours increase. For cargo owners who consign goods in whole cars, the railway bureau requires them to submit a transportation plan every month. If no plan is submitted, the railway may refuse to allocate cars when there are insufficient vehicles. Today, the railway lines are becoming longer and longer, and the transportation tasks are becoming more and more arduous, while the increase in vehicles is limited; if the railway does not carry out planned transportation and shorten the vehicle turnover rate, it will not be possible to complete the state's military transportation and the state's general passenger and freight transportation plan. The Railway Department's regulations on fines for delayed freight cars are not for the purpose of fining, but for the purpose of eliminating vehicle delays and preventing the waste of transportation capacity, so that every minute and every second of our vehicles can be used in the cause of building a new democracy.
    The promulgation of the national passenger and freight tariffs and passenger and freight transportation rules by the Military Commission's Railway Department is a very important event in the history of people's railways. In the past, when the railway completed the state's passenger and freight transportation tasks, there were shortcomings in the use and care of the state's transportation capacity, and in the care of goods and passengers. Due to the bureaucratic style left over from the Kuomintang for a long time, and because the Military Commission's Railway Department had not taken over the railway for a long time and lacked experience, individual employees still maintained the Kuomintang's bad style of being divorced from the masses to treat passengers and cargo owners today. Strict ideological struggle and business learning must be carried out to overcome these shortcomings. Now our task of restoring and developing the national economy is becoming more and more huge, and the state's passenger and freight transportation tasks urgently require us to run the people's railway passenger and freight business well. To run the people's railway passenger and freight business well, in addition to the efforts of railway workers, it also requires the supervision and care of the people of the whole country for their own railways. Only with the concerted efforts and assistance of the broad masses of the people can our people's railways rapidly move forward. [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 9th]

### 办好人民铁路客货运营业

　　办好人民铁路客货运营业
    中国人民革命军事委员会铁道部于最近颁布了“全国铁路客货运运价”、“货物分等”、“货物技术规定装载量”、“旅客运价杂费计算规则”、“货物运价杂费计算规则”和目前暂行的“货物运送规则及补则”、“旅客行李包裹运送规则及补则”。这些规则和运价率的颁布，对于全国铁路客货运营业迅速走向统一管理，有很大的意义。
    人民铁路客货运价和客货运运送规则等的统一，看似一件小事，其实却是几十年人民革命斗争的结果。中国铁路到现在已有八十一年的历史，这八十一年的铁路史基本上是各个帝国主义和中国封建官僚资本分割垄断的历史。帝国主义和官僚资本各霸一方，因之中国铁路始终没有统一的运价，统一的规章。我们记得，过去国民党相互接连的京沪、浙赣、粤汉、正太、同蒲铁路，各有不同的客货运价及规章，由京沪或同蒲铁路到其他接连的铁路旅行或托运货物，需要重新起票；在路局方面，两局联运，运费要互相清算。这对旅客和货主是多么不便，多么耗费人力！但是从今天起，这种不统一现象将永远不会再有了。
    人民解放军的各路野战军正在向南方和西北各省进行着中国有史以来的大进军，全国解放已经为期不远了。发展生产，繁荣经济，把我们由落后的农业国变成先进的工业国，将要成为我们全部工作的重点。而要发展生产，繁荣经济，就需要大量原料制成品的运输。需要把大量原料安全地运到工厂矿山，把大量制成品安全地运到各个市场。因此，办好人民铁路客货运营业是极其重要的。铁路和货主应保证以最少的运输资材上的消耗，来组织计划运输，来完成国家客货运输计划。同时铁路在运价政策上要有很好的配合与掌握，也就是说，配合我们国家的总的经济政策，按照某个地区和某个时间对于物资需要什么，提倡什么，奖励什么，不要什么，限制什么，而订出适当的运价。我们在铁路营业上反对单纯营利观点，同时我们也反对缺乏发展的观点。这次铁道部颁布的运价规章，就是本着这个方针来订定的。
    首先在货物分等方面，已经作了相当的改进。过去北方各局货物分等仅分为五个等级，东北也只分成十等。但先进的社会主义国家苏联，却已经将载运的货物分为一百一十个等级。我们客观的条件比起苏联来自然还有很大的距离，所以我们初步的改革是将货物分为二十个等级。货物等级愈能适当的多分，愈为合理，因为等级适当地多分，不仅使货物对运价的负担易于合理，更便于贯彻国家对某些货物奖励提倡或限制的经济政策。
    各等货物运价互相间相差的比率，也是与货物对运价的负担关系很大的。过去国民党统治时期货物分为五等，一等当五等的五·○六倍。这样的等差比率，运送一二级品例如奢侈品、化妆品、非必需品很占便宜，而运送民生必需的大宗货物，相对地却很贵。这一套办法是不利于广大的劳动人民，而有利于剥削阶级的。在这个地方，我们采取了革命性的改进。这次规定运价一等比二十等高二百倍。我们依东北一九四九年计划的直接运输成本，订为十八级货物的运价。为发展工业和照顾民生大宗日用品，我们把工业必需品、和民生必需品尽可能都列在接近直接成本的等级，必要的物资如煤及各种矿砂，都放在直接运输成本的等级以下。为使工业厂址接近原料产地，促使地域分工，造成运输力的合理使用，我们把制成品与原料品的等级也放得接近。为补助文化教育事业，把教育用品书籍杂志也都列在较低的等级。但是对于奢侈品、贵重品、非必需品，则提高其等级用以限制。这次货物分为二十个等级是对的，但在二十个等级中对每种货物安排的是否妥当，还需要广大人民在今后实际工作中考察研究并希望提供意见以备以后改正。
    在过去国民党统治时期，因为各路各自为政，对于运价，有的规定了递远递减的办法，有的没有规定。规定递减的，其递减程度大小亦不一致。为鼓励货物作远途的运输，运价采取递远递减的方法是必不可少的。今天新运价已经作了统一彻底的改革。新运价规定货物运送一○○公里以内不减；由一○一公里至四○○公里，每十公里减去营业公里的○·○三公里；四○一公里至一○○○公里，每十公里减去营业公里的○·○五公里；一○○一至二○○○公里，每十公里减去营业公里的○·○六公里。按照此种递减程度，运送一○○○公里所收运费，为不递减运费的百分之五七·四，也就是说，按照不递减运费少收百分之四二·六。除定有递远递减办法外，并订有特定运价。如由东北铁路总局管内发往由海关以南各站的高粱米、苞米、豆油，减百分之五十。此外对木材、建设用洋灰、煤及经由几个指定车站出入口的某些物资，也订有特价。这种特价的订定，和发展生产、繁荣经济的新民主主义的经济政策是相配合的。
    这次公布的客货运运送规则及补则，明确地规定了铁路货主间的权利与义务。今天人民铁路的管理要向广大的人民负责。它必须防止一切可能发生的浪费或不良现象。比如现在规定了货物、行李、包裹交付期间，若铁路不按时交付，行李每迟延一天铁路要受罚运费额的三十分之二；包裹每迟延一天，铁路受罚运费额的三十分之一；货物每迟延一天，铁路受罚运费额百分之二到百分之四。同时又规定了货物行李包裹赔偿标准。如因铁路方面的原因，致货物遭受损失，铁路按到站的市价赔偿；货主如愿赔偿同样实物时，铁路按同样实物赔偿之。这些规定是公平合理的。过去国民党的铁路没有这种规定，它也不会有这种规定。这个分别说明了今天的铁路怎样重视着货主的利益，怎样把人民的权利放在前边。这种作法，不但使货主托运的东西有了可靠的保证，同样也使办理铁路营业的人员加强了责任心，使铁路运输效力和信誉更加提高。另一方面，规则中也严格地规定了计划运输和货主应受的罚款。在义务规则中规定了货车延期罚款。如因货主方面的原因，致将货车延期，延期由一小时至六小时，每吨每小时罚人民券三十元，由七小时至十二小时，每吨每小时罚人民券六十元，以后每增加六小时，倍增累进。对于以整车托运货物的货主，路局要求其每月提出运输计划，若不提出计划，铁路在车辆不足时可拒绝配车。今天铁路线路日益延长，运输任务日益繁重，而车辆的增加有限；铁路要完成国家军运和国家一般的客货运运输计划，如果不作有计划的运输，并缩短车辆周转率，是不可能完成任务的。铁道部规定货车延期罚款，不是为罚款而罚款，其目的在于消灭车辆延期，防止运输力的浪费，为了使我们的车辆每一分钟每一秒钟都用在有益于建设新民主主义的事业上去。
    军委铁道部颁布的全国客货运运价和客货运运送规则，在人民铁道历史上是一件很重要的事情。过去铁路在完成国家客货运运输任务时，对国家运输力的使用爱护上，对货物及旅客的关心上，都存有缺点。由于国民党长期留下来的官僚作风，又由于军委铁道部对铁路接管不久，经验不够，个别职员在今天还保持国民党脱离群众的恶劣作风来对待旅客，对待货主。对于这些缺点必须展开严格的思想斗争和业务学习，才能克服。现在我们恢复与发展国民经济的任务日益巨大，国家客货运输任务迫切需要我们办好人民铁路客货运营业。要办好人民铁路客货运营业，除铁路职工努力外，还需全国人民监督爱护人民自己的铁路。也只有在广大人民齐心合力协助爱护之下，才能使我们的人民铁路迅速地向前进步。    　【新华社北平九日电】
