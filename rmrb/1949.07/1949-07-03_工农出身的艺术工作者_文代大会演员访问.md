　　Among the art troupes participating in this Literary and Art Congress, there are many outstanding young art workers from worker-peasant backgrounds. They have never attended any art schools or specialized institutions. Starting from the lowest level of literacy, they have learned not only to read scripts and musical scores but have also become actors, playwrights, and musicians loved by the vast number of soldiers. They have lived in the army since they were young, integrated with the soldiers as they grew up. They portray soldiers and sing the soldiers' battle songs, and the soldiers are often inspired by their performances and songs. Under the education of the Party, they have undergone practical revolutionary training and arduous study, gradually cultivating themselves to not only improve their cultural level but also acquire specialized skills, enabling them to truly serve the "soldiers" well. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the three years of the People's Liberation War, they have made great contributions to serving the soldiers.

　　Zhang Peihang, a young backbone member of the Second Field Army Art Troupe, is one such music worker who has been tempered through hardship. He joined the army at the age of twelve, still a "little devil" referred to as a "puppy." He is only twenty-four years old this year and is from Jiexiu, Shanxi. In the army, his superiors saw that he liked acting and had artistic talent. In 1939, he was sent to the "Mars Troupe" of the Political Department of the 18th Group Army Field Army. Soon after, he was transferred to the "Experimental Troupe" of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts in the Taihang area. There, he began his arduous studies and work. Due to his passion, he chose music. When he saw the students of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts learning various musical instruments, he very much wanted to find a violin or erhu to learn, but he couldn't afford it at the time, nor was it easy to buy. So, he began to think of various ways, running to the mountains dozens of miles away to pick up wood and make his own. He used willow branches for the bow, steel wire from electric wires for the strings, and a tin can covered with frog or pangolin skin for the erhu drum. Amazingly, he made an erhu this way. Although the sound was small, it was very pleasant, and he was very happy because it was made with his own hands. From then on, Zhang Peihang began to learn to play the erhu and play it for the soldiers. Due to his hard work, he also learned to play the violin. In Handan, he helped many comrades in the art troupe collectively make violins, and he himself made a cello. He not only learned musical instruments but also began to try to find materials from the lives of the soldiers to compose music, so that the soldiers could see songs that portrayed their own lives. Because he grew up in the army, he was familiar with the lives and feelings of the soldiers. He said, "I can play the soldiers' thoughts and feelings, that is my skill. If I can't grasp the soldiers' thoughts and feelings, then my studies and work will be a complete failure." In the orchestra's performances, he is considered one of the best.

　　Peihang never imagined that a child from such a poor background like him would have the opportunity to become an outstanding music worker. Hearing that he was coming to Beiping to participate in the art troupe performance, the leadership specially bought a very good bow string for his beloved cello. He was so happy. When the reporter interviewed him, he told the reporter happily like a child: "I must play well, play everything about the soldiers...".

　　In the Second Field Army Art Troupe, there is also a young music worker named Zhao Yushan. He is a farmer's child and has been engaged in literary and art work in the army for more than ten years. He seems so taciturn. The long military life has made him very strong. He fought in guerrilla warfare and can play the sanxian and the accordion well. As he himself said, he is a literary and art worker who grew up in battle. Like Zhang Peihang, the proficiency of their skills is combined with the feelings of the soldiers. His most outstanding aspect of his musical work is his strong ability to appreciate music. He is considered a promising military music worker. He often likes to read books on music theory and collect materials about the lives of soldiers. Although his cultural level is not high, he has made a lot of progress in the study of music theory and the performance of music through such continuous study. According to his companions, he often practices the sanxian alone until late at night. He also tried to compose songs such as "The People's Liberation Army Crosses the Yangtze River" and "A Raincoat," which were loved by the soldiers.

　　"Little Devil" Zhang Xiqi is an excellent playwright for soldiers who loves drama. He joined the Eighth Route Army at the age of twelve. He didn't know many characters. After arriving in the army, he began to perform children's plays. He worked very hard. In the army, he studied hard with his comrades. He was reading even while marching. He never forgot the only small fountain pen he had. He tied it to his clothes with a rope. He practiced writing diaries every day. He tried to write about the combat life of soldiers. At first, he couldn't even write a sentence properly. From the piles of typos, he gradually learned to write about the lives of soldiers. And he can create very good soldier language that soldiers like to read, such as "Meritorious Service Quick Talk" and "Zhang Yongshan," which have been widely performed in their troops. From 1947 to 1948, during the struggle to defend the Dabie Mountains, they marched every day. He did not forget to collect materials from combat life during the march. During a rare break, they took out the erhu and violin they were carrying, hung up a few sheets, and performed for the soldiers. The next day, they got up and continued marching and fighting. This is how they served the soldiers.

　　Xu Liankai portrays soldiers so realistically that he can grasp the psychology of the soldiers. He is an excellent actor who is praised by the soldiers as an actor of "soldiers." His father was a dock worker. When he was twelve years old, he and his father joined the propaganda team of the Eighth Route Army. He did odd jobs, and his father was a cook. They lived happily in the propaganda team. After his father died of illness during an anti-mopping-up operation in Taihang, he was transferred to the experimental troupe to learn acting, starting with stage work. Later, in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Art Troupe, just as the movement of serving soldiers through drama was unfolding, Xu Liankai, who was originally a soldier, went to the army to participate in drama work. Because he personally went in and out of the battlefield and had a deep understanding of the lives of soldiers, he easily became a very good "soldier" actor. He is best at playing the role of "villain," making people feel so interesting, but his performance is not satire but persuasion. People who have not truly and deeply experienced military life cannot perform it.

　　工农出身的艺术工作者　文代大会演员访问
    柏生
    在参加这次文代大会演出的几个部队文工团里面，有不少优秀的工农出身的部队青年艺术工作者。他们从没有进过什么艺术学校或专门学校，他们从不识字的最低的文化程度，竟学习到不但能读剧本，读曲谱，而且成为一个为广大战士所喜爱的演员、剧作者、音乐工作者。他们从小就生活在部队里，成年的和战士们结合在一起，他们扮演着士兵和歌唱着士兵的战斗的声音，士兵也经常为他们的扮演和歌声所鼓舞着。在党的教育下，他们经受着实际革命的锻炼，和艰苦的学习，逐步地被培养起来，使自己不但提高了文化的水平，而且学到了专门的技术，能真正很好的为“兵”服务。在八年的抗日战争和三年的人民解放战争中，他们在为兵服务上有着很大的贡献。
    第二野战军文工团的年青的乐队骨干张佩衡同志，就是这样一个从艰苦中锻炼出来的音乐工作者。他十二岁开始参加部队的时候，还是被人喊做小狗的一个“小鬼”，今年才只有二十四岁，山西介休人。在部队里上级看他很喜欢演戏，挺有艺术天才，一九三九年就把他送到当时十八集团军野战政治部的“火星剧团”，不久他又被转送到太行区鲁迅艺术学校的“实验剧团”。在那里他开始了刻苦的学习和工作。由于他的爱好，他选择了音乐。当他看见鲁迅艺术学校的学生们学习着各种乐器的时候，他心里就非常的想望着自己也能找到一个提琴或二胡来学习，但是他当时买不起，也不容易买到。于是就开始想了各种方法，跑到十几里外的山上拣了木头，自己动手去做。他用柳树枝做弓，电线里面的钢丝做弦，洋铁筒子上蒙了一层青蛙皮或＠①鱼皮做胡琴鼓，居然他就这样的做成了一把二胡。虽然拉起来声音很小，但是很好听，而且是用自己的手做出来的，他该多欢喜。张佩衡从此就开始学会了拉二胡，并且拉给战士们听。由于他的刻苦努力，他还学会了拉小提琴。在邯郸他帮助文工团的许多同志集体制做小提琴，他自己还做了一把大提琴。他不仅学会了乐器，而且自己也开始试着在战士们的生活中找材料谱起曲子来，使战士们能够看到表演他们自己的生活的曲子。因为从小生长在部队里，使他熟悉了战士们的生活和感情。他说：“我能拉出战士们的思想和感情来，这就是我的技术。如果我掌握不住战士们的思想和感情，那我的学习和工作就完全失败了。”在乐队的演奏中，他被认为是成绩最佳的一个。
    佩衡真没想到象他这样一个穷苦出身的孩子，还能有机会做一个优秀的音乐工作者。听说他这次到北平来参加部队文工团演出，领导上特给他最心爱的大提琴买了一把很好的弓弦，他高兴得什么似的，当记者去访问他时，他还孩子似的愉快的告诉记者说：“我一定要好好的拉，拉出战士们的一切……。”
    在第二野战军文工团还有一个年青的音乐工作者，他的名字叫做赵玉山，他是一个农家的孩子，在部队里从事文艺工作已经十几年了，看起来他是那么沉默寡言，长久的部队生活使他锻炼得非常坚强。他打过游击战，同时能弹得一手好三弦，和拉得一手好的手风琴。这些正象他自己所说的，他是在战斗中成长起来的文艺工作者。他和张佩衡一样，他们的技术的熟练是结合在士兵们的感情上面的。他在音乐工作上最突出的地方就是鉴赏音乐的能力很强。他被认为是一个很有发展前途的部队音乐工作者。他自己常喜欢看些音乐理论方面的书籍。和收集些战士们的生活材料。虽然他的文化程度并不高，但在这样不断埋头的文化学习中，在乐理的研究和音乐的演奏方面他都有了不少的成绩。听他的伙伴们说，他常常独自一个人，抱着一把三弦，练习到深夜。并且他自己还试着谱了“人民解放军过长江”和“一件雨衣”等曲子，得到战士们的喜爱。
    “小鬼”张锡琪是一个爱好戏剧的士兵的优秀剧作者，他从十二岁起就参加了八路军。他不识多少字，到部队里后，开始演儿童剧。他很用功，在部队里跟着同志们刻苦的学习，在行军的时候他都在看书。他身边永远忘不掉那支惟一的小钢笔，他把它用绳子拴在衣服上。他每天练习着记日记。试着写战士们作战的生活。最初连句子也写不通，从连篇的错字中，他逐渐的能写出战士们的生活来。而且能创作出很好的兵言兵语的战士们所喜欢读的剧本来，如“立功快板”“张勇山”等都已在他们的部队中普遍演出。一九四七年至一九四八年，在坚持大别山的战斗中，他们天天行军，在行军中他都没有忘记搜集战斗生活的材料。在难得的一次休息时间里他们拿出自己背着的二胡、提琴，挂上几个被单子就给战士们演起来了。第二天爬起来接着就又是行军和战斗。他们就是这样为士兵服务的。
    徐连凯扮演起士兵来，是那么真切能抓住战士们的心理，他是一个被战士们誉为演“兵”的优秀演员。他父亲是一个码头工人。十二岁那年他和他的父亲一起参加了八路军的宣传队。他做小勤务，他父亲做炊事员。在宣传队里他们生活得很愉快。在太行的一次反扫荡中，他父亲带病牺牲后，他被调到实验剧团学习演戏，开始做舞台工作，以后在晋冀鲁豫文艺工作团正逢着展开戏剧为士兵服务的运动，本来就是一个战士的徐连凯，这时又下到部队里参加戏剧工作，而且因为亲身出入战场，对战士的生活体验深刻，他便很容易的成功为一个很好的“兵”的演员。他最善于扮演那种叫做“反派”的角色，使人感觉那么有趣，但是他的表演不是讽刺而是规劝，不是真正深刻体验了部队生活的人，是演不出来的。
