　　Japanese Communist Party Akahata editorial
  　Vehemently condemns the Japanese government's fascist atrocities
    Laboring people strongly oppose Yoshida's reactionary policies
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," on the 23rd, published an editorial vehemently condemning the statement by Japanese Prosecutor General Aota Fukui regarding "the government will severely punish those who disrupt public order with violence." Akahata pointed out: The Yoshida government is using the fascist methods of Hitler and Tojo to oppress the masses. Akahata emphasized and declared: No attack by the reactionaries can make the Communist Party surrender. At the same time, the Tokyo Municipal Committee of the Japanese Communist Party formally filed a complaint on the 22nd against Saito Noboru, the chief of the National Police Agency, and the police investigating the train derailment at the Takanawa Station in Tokyo. The Tokyo Municipal Committee of the Japanese Communist Party pointed out that this "investigation" is a political conspiracy to slander the Communist Party; and condemned the illegal intrusion into the residences of two laid-off railway worker Communist Party members and their illegal detention.
    According to a TASS report: The anti-people policies of the Yoshida reactionary cabinet, supported by the American occupation authorities, are arousing strong opposition from the broad strata of the Japanese people, and the strike movement has recently greatly increased. Following the general strike of miners, the strike wave in June spread to the metallurgical, hardware, and other industrial sectors. In addition to economic demands, the laboring people are demanding Japanese national independence and fighting for peace and democracy. The American and Japanese reactionaries are using even more barbaric means of oppression to undermine the resistance of the Japanese laboring people. It is reported that the Yoshida cabinet is currently considering "emergency measures," which clearly stipulate that the police have the right to "kill on the spot those who occupy state property such as police stations and prosecutor's offices." In reality, this measure is an open use of force to suppress any resistance to the anti-people policies of the American and Japanese reactionaries. To this end, the Japanese cabinet plans to further increase the number of police and strengthen their equipment. The Japanese ruling clique is strengthening the anti-communist movement and attempting to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal. Japanese democratic forces emphasize that these actions by the Yoshida cabinet and the American authorities greatly violate the Potsdam Declaration and the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission regarding guaranteeing the democratic rights of the Japanese people.

　　日共赤旗报著论
  　痛斥日政府法西斯暴行
    劳动人民强烈反对吉田反动政策
    【新华社北平二十六日电】东京讯：日本共产党机关报“赤旗”廿三日著论痛斥日检察长福井青田关于“政府将严惩以暴行破坏公共秩序者”的声明。赤旗报指出：吉田政府正使用希特勒与东条的法西斯手段，压迫人民大众。赤旗报强调宣称：反动派的任何进攻，均不能使共产党屈服。同时，日共东京市委会已于二十二日对全国警察署署长斋藤升及调查东京见高车站火车出轨事件的警察，正式提出控告。日共东京市委会指出这种“调查”，乃是诽谤共产党的政治阴谋；并斥责此非法闯入二名被裁的铁道工人共产党员的住宅，并将他们非法拘捕的罪行。
    据塔斯社报道：美国占领当局支持的吉田反动内阁的反人民政策，正引起日本广大阶层人民的强烈反对，罢工运动近已大大增加。在矿工总罢工之后，六月罢工浪潮曾扩及冶金、五金业及其他工业部门。劳动人民除经济要求以外，并要求日本民族独立，要求为和平及民主而斗争。美、日反动派正以更野蛮的压迫手段来破坏日本劳动人民的抵抗。据悉，吉田内阁目前正考虑“紧急措施”，该措施明确规定：警察有权“就地格杀侵占如警察局、检察官办公处等类的国家财产的人”。实际上，这种措施就是公开以武力镇压任何对美、日反动派反人民政策的反抗。为此，日本内阁计划进一步增加警察人数，并加强其装备。日本统治集团正加强反共运动，并试图宣布日共为非法。日本民主势力着重指出：吉田内阁及美国当局的这些举动，大大地违反了波茨坦声明及远东委员会关于保证日本人民民主权利的各项决定。
