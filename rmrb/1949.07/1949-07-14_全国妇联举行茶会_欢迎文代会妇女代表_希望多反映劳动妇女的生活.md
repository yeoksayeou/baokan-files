　　All-China Women's Federation Holds Tea Party
    Welcoming Women Representatives to the Literary and Art Congress
  　Hopes for More Reflections of Working Women's Lives
    [Reported by this newspaper] The All-China Democratic Women's Federation held a tea party yesterday afternoon (the 13th) at the Beijing Hotel to welcome the women representatives attending the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers. More than 30 women literary and art workers attended, including Ding Ling, Li Bozhao, Chen Xuezhao, Cao Ming, Peng Hui, Fang Lingru, Bai Yang, Zhou Xiaoyan, Feng Zi, Shu Xiuwen, and Hu Peng, as well as more than 20 staff members of the Democratic Women's Federation. Comrade Qu Mengjue, Secretary-General of the Federation, presided over the meeting and explained the significance of the gathering as a gesture of welcome. Honorary Chairman He Xiangning said in her speech that she was very excited to meet everyone. She hoped that everyone would work hard for production and construction under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao. Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the Federation, hoped that women literary and art workers would do more publicity and mobilization work to make women across the country aware of the era we are in. The Asian Women's Conference will soon be held in Beiping, and she hoped that everyone would have good works to introduce to international sisters. Ding Ling explained the arduousness of the work of women literary and art workers in the liberated areas and hoped that everyone would give them support. At the same time, she hoped that women literary and art workers would truthfully reflect the lives of women across the country, especially the lives of working women. She reviewed that female comrades who had previously engaged in literary and art work did not pay enough attention to women's work, and proposed that if we want to write something today, we must first do a good job of reflecting women's lives.
    Comrade Cai Chang, Chairman of the Federation, rushed from elsewhere to meet everyone. Peng Hui, Su Wei, Li Bozhao, Chen Xuezhao, Fang Lingru, and others also spoke successively, all expressing that they would pay more attention to women's work in the future and reflect the lives of working women more. They also suggested that the Women's Federation should help women literary and art workers solve the difficulties of taking care of their children so that they can concentrate on their work. Finally, Comrade Shuai Mengqi, Minister of Organization, Shen Zijiu, Minister of Propaganda and Education, and Kang Keqing, Minister of Women and Children's Welfare of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, spoke, hoping that everyone would adhere to the direction of literary and art work serving workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao, and work harder, asking them to write more for "New China Women," and to study children's education issues, write more children's stories, children's dramas, songs, cartoons, and movies suitable for children.
