Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: TASS, Moscow - A "News Report" editorial on the 1st wrote: The victories achieved by the Soviet Union's national economy in the first six months of 1949 once again convincingly demonstrate the tremendous superiority of the Soviet system – the socialist economic system. The increasing decline of American industrial production and the deterioration of the economic situation in Britain and Western European countries under the Marshall Plan make the increase in Soviet industrial production, the high growth of the transportation industry and agriculture, and the prosperity of science and culture particularly prominent. The report wrote: The miners of the Stalin Coal Trust and the Artem Coal Trust, and the miners of the Donets, Kizel Basin, and Krasnoyarsk Coal Trust, completed their six-month targets ahead of schedule. A steady increase in production speed has also been seen in the metallurgical industry. Hundreds of machine manufacturing plants in Moscow, Leningrad, the Urals, Ukraine, the Volga region, and the Baltic republics, as well as hundreds of textile, food, light industrial, and other enterprises, have exceeded the plans for the first six months and produced huge amounts of products. The report emphasized the rich and truly endless creative power of the Soviet state, and the strong capabilities and patriotic creativity demonstrated by the Soviet people in ensuring the well-being of their motherland. The report concluded by calling on the people to strive for new victories in the second half of the year, to successfully complete the 1949 plan, and to complete the Stalin post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule.

　　消息报评苏联经济成就
  　再次证明社会主义经济制度无比优越
    【新华社北平四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报一日社论写道：一九四九年头六个月苏联国民经济所获得的胜利，再一次令人信服地证明了苏维埃制度——社会主义的经济制度巨大的优越性。美国工业生产的日益下降，英国和西欧马歇尔化国家经济情势的恶化，使得苏联工业生产量的增加、运输业与农业的高涨和科学与文化的繁荣，显得特别突出。该报写道：斯大林煤托拉斯和阿杰姆煤托拉斯的矿工，顿尼兹、基泽尔盆地和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克煤托拉斯的矿工，提前完成了六个月的目标。在冶金工业里也看到了生产速度的稳步增加。莫斯科、列宁格勒、乌拉尔、乌克兰、伏尔加州和波罗的海沿岸的共和国千百家机器制造厂，以及千百种纺织、食品、轻工业和其他企业，已超过头六个月的计划而生产了巨大数额的产品。该报着重指出了苏维埃国家的丰富的和真正无穷无尽的创造力量，苏维埃人民为保证他们祖国的福利所表现的坚强能力和爱国主义的创造性。该报在结语中号召人民在下半年内争取新的胜利，很好地完成一九四九年的计划，和先期完成斯大林战后五年计划。
