Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, July 7th: Over 200,000 people in Beiping enthusiastically commemorated the 12th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War and celebrated the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference. The meeting was held at Tiananmen Square at 8:00 PM on the 7th. The leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu attended. The venue was magnificent and splendid. Seven large palace lanterns hung on the Tiananmen Gate, with thirty red flags inserted. Between the huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu was a huge red star, shining brightly. Although it was raining continuously in the afternoon, the people attending the meeting were still in a sea of people. There were 65 units including party, government, military, and civilian organizations and groups from Beiping, as well as the CPC Central Committee and various democratic parties, people's organizations, and citizens from all walks of life, totaling 200,000 people.

Then, all the attendees stood up and observed a moment of silence to pay tribute to the martyrs who died in the Anti-Japanese War. Subsequently, Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Presidium, delivered the opening speech. He said: Just now there were gunshots. Twelve years ago today, there were also gunshots in Beiping; but at that time it was the sound of the Japanese imperialists' attack, but today it is the sound of the people celebrating the victory of the People's Liberation War, celebrating the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, and celebrating the beginning of the establishment of a new people's democratic China. The independent, democratic, and free new China that we have longed for for twelve years is now beginning to be realized. This is a great victory for the Chinese people and a great victory for the people of the world. We must warmly celebrate our victory. After the opening speech, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chairman Dong Biwu of the North China People's Government, Secretary Bo Yibo of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Commander Nie Rongzhen of the North China Military Region, Mayor Ye Jianying of Beiping, Chairman Li Jishen of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Standing Committee Member Shen Junru of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Chairman Guo Moruo of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, Representative Xu Deheng of the Jiusan Society, Representative Wu Han of the Beiping Branch of the China Democratic League, and Director Xiao Ming of the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Federation of Trade Unions spoke successively. During the speeches, Chairman Mao, accompanied by General Zhou Enlai, arrived at the meeting at 9:20 PM. The 200,000 people on the scene immediately erupted in continuous cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao also led everyone to shout "Long live the Chinese people!" "People of the whole country unite!" "Down with imperialism!" "Build a new China!" and other slogans. Amidst thunderous applause and shouts, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Shen Junru, representing the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, respectively, accepted the flags presented by the conference. In the warm cheers of the audience, Chairman Mao again led everyone to shout slogans such as "People of the whole country unite! People of the world unite! Down with imperialism! Down with the running dogs of imperialism, the Chinese reactionaries! Convene a new political consultative conference, establish a democratic coalition government! Sign a peace treaty with Japan! Strive for world peace and democracy! Long live the unity of the people of the whole country!" At this time, although the rain was getting heavier and heavier, the 200,000 people participating in the meeting became more and more enthusiastic and followed Chairman Mao in shouting slogans in the pouring rain.

The meeting passed a telegram and two congratulatory telegrams to the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army, Zhu De, and then announced the adjournment at 10:30 PM. At that time, dozens of mercury lamps illuminated the entire venue. Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and General Zhou Enlai stood on the rostrum to review the mighty mass ranks. In the torrential rain, to the sound of majestic military music and the deafening sound of Yangko drums, 200,000 people sang and cheered.
