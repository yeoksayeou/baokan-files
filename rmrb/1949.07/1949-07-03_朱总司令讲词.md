　　Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Speech
　　Representatives, Comrades:
　　The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers of China opens today.
　　On behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, I congratulate the conference on its success.
　　China’s new literary and art movement has various schools and tendencies, but its mainstream, since the May Fourth Movement of 1919, has always been linked to the Chinese people’s democratic revolution. The left-wing literary and art movement that developed during the ten years of civil war after the failure of the First Great Revolution in China, especially the literary and art movement in the Chinese People's Liberation Area and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, although still flawed, had a broader connection with the people’s revolutionary struggle.
　　For thirty years, the new literature and art have attracted a large number of young people to embark on the road of progress and revolution. Many literary and art workers have participated in the revolutionary struggle themselves or sacrificed themselves in the revolutionary struggle. The people’s revolutionary struggle has been victorious, and the new literature and art have also been victorious. Today's congress is a manifestation of this victory. Literature and art and revolutionary struggle have such an inseparable relationship, which is the glory of China's new literature and art.
　　After the victory of the revolutionary struggle, the Chinese people will devote their main efforts to construction.
　　Literary and art workers will shoulder even greater responsibilities in the new era in the future. The main thing is to use the weapon of literature and art to encourage the people of the whole country, especially the working people, to unite as one, overcome difficulties, and correct shortcomings, so as to strive to build our independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous new country. After experiencing many difficulties, our country will reach a bright and prosperous era. I believe that our literature and art, after experiencing difficult times and overcoming their own shortcomings, will also reach a bright and prosperous era. The people are going to prosper, and literature and art that truly stand with the people will also prosper. I hope that literary and art workers across the country will unite, strengthen their work, and welcome this new era.

　　朱总司令讲词
    代表们，同志们：
    中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会今天开幕。
    我代表中国共产党中央委员会庆祝大会成功。
    中国的新文艺运动有各种不同的派别和倾向，但是他的主流，从一九一九年的“五四”运动以来，始终是和中国人民民主革命运动相联系的。在中国第一次大革命失败以后的十年内战时期发展起来的左翼文学艺术运动特别是中国人民解放区和中国人民解放军内的文学艺术运动，虽然还有缺点，但是与人民革命斗争是有更广泛的联系的。
    卅年来新的文学艺术吸引了大群的青年走上进步和革命的道路，不少的文学艺术工作者自己参加革命斗争或者牺牲在革命斗争中。人民革命斗争得到了胜利，新的文学艺术也得到了胜利，今天的大会，就是这个胜利的表现。文学艺术和革命斗争，有这样一个不可分离的关系，这是中国新文艺的光荣。
    中国人民在革命斗争胜利以后，将要把主要力量用在建设方面。
    文学艺术工作者在将来的新时代中，要担负比过去更重大的责任，这主要的就是文学艺术的武器鼓舞全国的人民，首先是劳动人民团结一致，克服困难，改正缺点，来努力建设我们的独立、自由、民主、统一、富强的新国家。我们的国家，在经历重重困难以后，将要达到一个光明的兴旺的时代。我相信我们的文学艺术，在经历困难时期并且克服自己的缺点以后一定也要达到一个光明的兴旺的时代。人民是要兴旺起来的，真正和人民站在一起的文学艺术，也一定是要兴旺起来的，希望全国的文学艺术工作者团结起来，加强工作，迎接这个新时代。
