　　Taking North Peak by Surprise
    Shi Cun Yannan
    After the liberation of Huayin, Han Zipei, the commissioner of the Eighth Administrative Region of the puppet Shaanxi Province and commander of the Sixth Security Brigade, led his remaining troops, numbering over a hundred, to escape to Mount Hua. The only extremely dangerous road and pass leading to the summit were tightly sealed off by Han's bandits, layer upon layer. Moreover, all around were thousand-foot cliffs and precipices. In order to rescue the residents on the mountain as soon as possible, the People's Liberation Army had to find another road to the mountain. Starting from June 10th, reconnaissance staff officer Liu Jiyao, along with six scouts, searched all the villages and valleys along the mountain for four full days, but without any results. On the morning of the 14th, as they were resting on a large rock at the foot of the mountain, they suddenly saw a woodcutter in his thirties running up, panting. The woodcutter carefully examined them for a while and then asked, "Are you the People's Liberation Army?" They replied, "Yes." The woodcutter looked them up and down with cautious eyes, and then excitedly grasped their hands and said, "Comrades! Come to my house, I have something to tell you."
    This woodcutter was named Wang Yinsheng, and he lived in Liangchakou, east of Mount Hua. Four years ago, his father carried firewood to Huayin Street to sell, but the bandit soldiers robbed the firewood and beat him severely. The old man died a few days after returning home, consumed by anger. Wang Yinsheng himself had been conscripted twice, enduring endless torture. When the puppet Sixth Security Brigade was stationed in Huayin, they often came to the mountain to rob the firewood he had gathered, leaving his family of five often hungry. He had long hoped that the People's Liberation Army would avenge him, and now his wish had come true. He excitedly told Staff Officer Liu that there was a small path leading to North Peak, and occupying North Peak would cut off all the enemy's retreat routes. He volunteered to lead them.
    Few people knew this path, and even the residents of Liangchakou rarely knew that it led to North Peak. Wang Yinsheng's mother, when she was young, had followed her husband along this path to dig for Hua ginseng; three years ago, when the bandit soldiers抓Wang Yinsheng into the army, she had told her son to escape along this path.
    Wang Yinsheng led Staff Officer Liu to his home and told his mother about leading the way to North Peak. The old lady was overjoyed and hurriedly borrowed a ten-odd-zhang long rope from a neighbor in the east gully and handed it to her son, repeatedly instructing him: "Be sure to secure the rope on 'Tianjing' firmly, climb past 'Swallow Somersault,' and take a few more steps, and you'll be at the stone cliff..." The old lady, afraid that her son would forget the route, drew and pointed on the ground.
    At noon, they plunged into the dense thickets, and from Liangchakou they went west for another four li through the cypress forest, reaching the end of Xingxing Gully. Looking up, hundreds of zhang of sheer cliffs stood before them. Wang Yinsheng pulled them to the bottom of the cliff, pointing to a dark hole about fifteen zhang high and saying, "This is 'Tianjing,' we have to go up from here." As he spoke, he put the large rope he was carrying around his waist, and with his legs apart, his feet braced against the two walls, he slowly climbed up. After a long time, a rope end was lowered from the cave, and the seven scouts were hoisted up to Tianjing one by one. After going up, they climbed a steep slope more than a thousand meters high, using shrubs and reeds. Ahead, another steep stone gully, about fifteen meters high, blocked their way. At this time, Wang Yinsheng displayed the skills he had honed over twenty years of gathering herbs and firewood in the mountains, using a crack in the stone to climb up, and tied the rope firmly to a thick wooden stake, hoisting everyone up. Continuing north for half a kilometer, another steep gully reaching the sky appeared. They had to cross through the middle of this gully. The top of the gully's waist protruded with overhanging eaves, and the bottom was a slightly sloping slippery slope. Below the slippery slope was an abyss that was impossible to see the bottom of. Wang Yinsheng led the seven scouts, using the upward and downward force of their feet and shoulders, like wedges, slowly passing through this stone trench about twelve meters long. At this time, if their legs weakened even slightly, they would fall into the unfathomable abyss. But none of them hesitated or flinched. The more difficult and dangerous it was, the more brave and strong it made them.
    After climbing over another small gully, they reached the river mouth, and it was already dark. In this pitch-black night, they slid down a stone slope nearly two thousand meters long along the aqueduct, reaching the foot of North Peak.
    Some of their shoes were worn out, and some of their feet were chafed, so they wrapped and tightened their feet with bark and bandages, climbing upwards along the trees for another five li, crossing four obstacles of trees erected by the enemy, and reached their destination—North Peak.
    The scouts completed the task of reconnaissance of the road. But when they discovered that the enemy's sentries were asleep, they made a temporary and decisive decision: to capture all the enemies on North Peak alive. Led by Wang Yinsheng, Staff Officer Liu rushed to the front of the Wuliang Zushi Temple, kicked open the temple door, fired five consecutive shots inside with a Sten gun, and shouted, "Lay down your guns and you will not be killed!" One enemy tried to throw a grenade, but before he could pull the pin, scout Lu De shot him down with one shot. So the other twenty-one enemies obediently became prisoners. They occupied all of North Peak. On the morning of the 15th, the fourteen enemies at Qunxianguan below North Peak, knowing that we had occupied North Peak, also surrendered their weapons.
    With us in control of North Peak, Han's bandits entrenched on West Peak were in a desperate situation, surrounded on three sides by thousand-foot cliffs, and with their only retreat route cut off by us. He no longer had the courage to resist stubbornly, nor the courage to jump off the cliff to commit suicide, and finally led dozens of lackeys down the mountain and became prisoners of the People's Liberation Army.

　　奇取北峰
    石村　言年
    华阴解放后，伪陕西省第八区专员兼保安第六旅旅长韩子佩，带领残部百余人，逃上了华山。唯一能通到顶峰的极为险要的道路、关口，都被韩匪严密的层层封锁。此外，四周都是千丈悬崖绝壁。解放军为了早日拯救山上的居民，不得不另外找一条通往山上的道路。从六月十日起，侦察参谋刘吉尧带了六个侦察员爬遍了沿山村庄、山谷，整整四天，没有一点结果。十四日早上，他们正在山根下的一块大石上休息，忽然看见一个三十多岁的樵夫，气喘喘地跑来。那个樵夫仔细地端详了他们一阵后问道：“你们是解放军吗？”他们回答说：“是的。”这个樵夫又用谨慎的眼光，将他们上下打量一番后，兴奋地握住他们的手说：“同志！到咱屋里去，我有话告诉你们。”
    这个樵夫，叫王银生，家住华山以东的两岔口。四年前，他的父亲挑柴到华阴街上去卖，胡匪抢了柴，还把他痛打一顿，回家不上几天，老人就气死了。王银生自己曾两次被抓去当兵，受尽了折磨。伪保六旅驻扎华阴时，经常到山边抢走他打回的柴火，使他全家五口人，常常挨饿。他早就盼望着解放军为他复仇，这一次可盼到了。他兴奋地告诉刘参谋，有一条可以通往北峰的小路，占领了北峰，就截住了所有敌人的退路。他自告奋勇地愿意给他们带路。
    这条路很少有人知道，两岔口的居民也很少知道它可通往北峰。王银生的母亲年轻时，曾跟着她的丈夫，沿着这条路挖过华参；三年前，胡匪抓王银生当兵，她曾告诉过她儿子打这条路逃跑。
    王银生领了刘参谋到了家里，把要带路去北峰的事情告诉了他的母亲。老太太高兴得了不得，急急忙忙从东沟邻家借来一根十来丈的长绳，交给她儿子，再三嘱咐他：“上‘天井’的绳千万拴牢，爬过‘鹞子翻身’，再走几步，就是石崖……”老太太怕儿子把路线忘记，在地上划来划去地指点着。
    中午，他们钻进了密集的灌木丛，从两岔口向西再钻四里柏林，到达猩猩沟的尽头。抬头一看，数百丈的绝崖耸立在面前了。王银生拉着他们走近绝崖的下边，指着向上约十五丈高的一个黑洞说：“这是‘天井’，我们要从这里上去。”说着就把背着的大绳套在腰间，又开两腿，两脚撑着两壁，徐徐而上。经过很久的时间，洞里放下来一根绳头，七个侦察员挨次地被吊上天井。上去又借着灌木芦草，爬了千余公尺高的一架陡坡，前面又有一个高约十五公尺的陡立石壑，挡住去路。这时，王银生施展出他在山里采药打柴二十余年练下的本领，借着一条石缝攀越了上去，把绳子牢牢拴紧在粗木桩上，把每个人吊了上去。再向北行一里路，又出现了一个插天入地的陡壑，他们必须从当腰穿过，这个壑腰的上面伸出飞檐，下面是几尺倾斜的滑坡，滑坡下就是望不到底的深渊。王银生领着七个侦察员，借着脚和肩膀的上下撑力，象个楔子似的，慢慢地通过这约十二公尺长的石壕。这个时候，只要腿稍为一软，就会堕入深不可测的悬崖。但他们没有一个人犹豫胆怯，越困难，越危险，也就越使他们勇敢坚强。
    再翻一个小沟，到了河口，天已黑了。在这漆黑的夜里，他们又顺水渠溜下近两千公尺的石头斜坡，到达了北峰脚下。
    他们有的鞋子磨破了，有的脚擦烂了，于是他们就用树皮和绑带把脚包住扎紧，攀着树木向上再爬了五里，越过敌人的四道树木障碍物，到达了目的地——北峰。
    侦察员们完成了侦察道路的任务。但当他们发现敌人的哨兵睡着以后，就又临时果断的决定：全部活捉北峰上的敌人。在王银生的带领下，刘参谋扑到无量祖师庙门前面，踏开庙门，用司登式枪向里面连发五响，并高喊“交枪不杀！”一个敌人企图往外掷手榴弹，但还没有来得及拉火，侦察员路德就一枪将他打倒了。于是其他二十一个敌人乖乖地当了俘虏。他们全部占领了北峰。十五日早上，北峰下群仙观的十四个敌人，知道我们占了北峰，也缴械投降。
    我们控制了北峰，盘踞西峰的韩匪，就处于三面临千丈悬崖，唯一退路又为我截断的绝境。他再没有勇气顽抗，也没有勇气跳崖自杀，终于带了数十个喽罗，下山当了人民解放军的俘虏。
