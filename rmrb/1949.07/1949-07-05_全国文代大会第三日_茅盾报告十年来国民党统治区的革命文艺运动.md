[Ping City News] The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers held its third day (July 4th), chaired by Tian Han. Mao Dun reported on the revolutionary literary and art movement in the Kuomintang reactionary ruling areas over the past decade. Mao Dun explained that the main spirit of the report was to review past work. The report first pointed out that the revolutionary literary and art movement in the KMT-controlled areas over the past decade has been successful. The overall goal of the struggle and the development of literary and artistic thought have basically followed the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao in its mainstream. Although progressive literary and art workers have suffered oppression and persecution under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary regime and have had shortcomings, they have been encouraged and promoted by the great strength of the military and civilians in the liberated areas, and have been influenced and combined with the democratic movements and student movements in the KMT-controlled areas in various periods. Moreover, the literary and art workers of various revolutionary classes have adhered to their work under broad unity, and finally broken through the barriers of oppression and defeated all reactionary literary and artistic activities, winning a victory.

He explained how the literary and art movement in the KMT-controlled areas has waged struggles in coordination with the development of the political situation in four periods. In these four periods, drama (such as "Qu Yuan," "Around the Qingming Festival," "Promotion Chart"), novels (such as "Corrosion"), poetry (such as Ma Fanto's Mountain Songs), comics, songs, movies, etc. have all played a fighting role in different periods.

Secondly, it is stated that under reactionary rule, mass movements could not be widely developed, and it was difficult for literary and art workers to have the opportunity to get close to the working people. Therefore, literary and artistic creation in the KMT-controlled areas failed to reflect the main contradictions and struggles in society at that time. In the works of progressive and revolutionary writers, some have chaotic and empty, dim and weak, or use the writer's subjectivity to explain objective reality, so that the works lack combat effectiveness. And other worse tendencies in the progressive literary and art camp, such as focusing on taste or taking the road of pornography and decadence, are even more harmful to readers.

Thirdly, it talked about the achievements and debates of progressive literary and art workers in the KMT-controlled areas in literary and artistic theory and thought, which is the unfolding of the discussion of three issues: First, the issue of popularization of literature and art; second, the issue of the political and artistic nature of literature and art; and third, the issue of "subjectivity" in literature and art, that is, the issue of the writer's position, viewpoint and attitude. He said that in the past ten years, there have been vague and chaotic phenomena in literary and artistic theory; for example, due to opposition to the tendency of dogmatism in literary and artistic thought, the guiding role of scientific literary and artistic thought was obliterated, and the flooding of petty-bourgeois thought was let loose; due to overemphasis on national viewpoints in the War of Resistance Against Japan, class viewpoints were relatively neglected; In order to widely unite democratic and patriotic writers, we forgot that there must be mutual distinction and mutual criticism in the united front. These problems have gradually been corrected and have had a trajectory of moving forward because of Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art and the examples of the literary and art movement in the liberated areas.

Finally, he concluded: The term "KMT-controlled area" will become a historical term with the complete and thorough elimination of reactionary military forces, and the statement of the literary and art movement in the KMT-controlled area will also become a historical relic in the history of literary and art movement. What unfolds before us is a brand-new era of the people. Progressive literary and art workers have a unified camp and complete freedom of writing and publication. We must learn from the times, learn from the people, conscientiously overcome the shortcomings that still exist, transform ourselves, and strive for progress. He hopes that friends who have adhered to progressive revolutionary literary and artistic work under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries should now hold the firmest determination and courage, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and together with the literary and art workers in the old liberated areas, undertake the new tasks given by the new era and strive to participate in the cultural construction of the people's democratic new China!

[Another News] The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers has just resolved to send a telegram of congratulations to the National Railway Workers' Provisional Congress being held in Beiping, establish contact, and learn from their spirit of serving the people of "where the army fights, the railway is built." The original telegram is as follows: To all representatives of the National Railway Workers' Congress:

At the same time as the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers is being held, we are pleased to hear that your congress is also being held in Beiping. We would like to extend our congratulations to you and are willing to maintain close contact with you and learn from you.

In the past, you supported the War of Liberation and completed transportation tasks. Wherever the army fought, the railway was built. You have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and collective creative spirit, and made great contributions to the construction of the people's railway. After this meeting, we believe that there will be more significant achievements in improving work efficiency and reducing transportation costs. Let us work together to eliminate all remaining reactionary forces and accelerate the industrialization and agriculturalization of China! We wish your congress success!

### 全国文代大会第三日  茅盾报告十年来国民党统治区的革命文艺运动

　　全国文代大会第三日
    茅盾报告十年来国民党统治区的革命文艺运动
    【平市讯】全国文学艺术工作者代表大会第三日（四日），田汉主席，茅盾报告十年来国民党反动派统治区革命文艺运动，茅盾说明报告的主要精神在检讨过去工作。报告首先指出十年来国统区革命文艺运动是有成就的，斗争的总目标和文艺思想的发展，就其主流来讲，基本上是遵循着毛主席所指出的方向。尽管进步的文艺工作者在国民党反动政权统治下受尽了压制与迫害，本身也存在着缺点，但因解放区军民大众伟大力量的鼓舞、推动，与国统区各时期民主运动，学生运动的互相影响互相结合，更加各革命阶层的文艺工作者在广泛的团结下坚持了工作，终于冲破了压迫的壁垒，击垮了一切反动的文艺活动而打了胜仗。
    他将十年来国统区的文艺运动，分四个时期来说明了它怎样配合政治形势的发展而进行了斗争；在四个时期中，戏剧（如“屈原”、“清明前后”、“升官图”）、小说（如“腐蚀”）、诗歌（如马凡陀的山歌）、漫画、歌咏、电影等等都曾在不同的时期发挥了战斗的作用。
    次述在反动统治下，群众运动不可能广泛地发展，文艺工作者很难有机会去和劳动人民接近，因此国统区文艺创作没有能够反映出当时社会中的主要矛盾与主要斗争。在进步的、革命的作家的作品中就有的有着混乱空疏，黯淡无力，或以作家的主观来解释客观的现实的缺点，以致作品的战斗性不足；而在进步文艺阵营内的另一些更坏的倾向，如以趣味为中心或走色情、颓废的道路，则更是对读者有毒害的。
    再次谈到十年来国统区进步文艺工作者在文艺理论思想上的成就和论争，那就是三个问题讨论的展开：第一、关于文艺大众化的问题；第二、关于文艺政治性与艺术性的问题；第三、关于文艺中的“主观”问题，亦即关于作家的立场、观点与态度的问题。他说在十年内，文艺理论上曾经有过模糊与混乱的现象；譬如由于反对文艺思想上教条主义倾向，以致抹煞了科学的文艺思想的指导作用而放纵了小资产阶级思想的泛滥；由于过于强调抗日战争中的民族观点而比较忽略了阶级观点；为了要广泛地团结民主的爱国的作家而忘记了统一战线中必须有互相区别与互相批评。这些问题都因有了毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话及解放区文艺运动的范例，才逐渐地得到了若干纠正，有了向前进行的轨迹。
    最后结语说：国统区这名词即将随着反动军事力量的全部彻底消灭而成为历史的名词，国统区文艺运动这说法也要成为文艺运动史上的陈迹了。在我们面前展开的是崭新的人民时代，进步的文艺工作者有着统一的阵营，有着完全的写作自由与发表自由了。我们要随时向时代学习，向人民学习，认真地克服还存在着的缺点，改造自己，努力进步。他希望曾经在国民党反动派统治下坚持进步的革命的文艺工作的朋友们，现在应抱定最坚强的决心和勇气，在毛主席领导下和老解放区文艺工作者共同担负起新时代所给予的新任务，努力参与人民民主的新中国的文化建设事业！
