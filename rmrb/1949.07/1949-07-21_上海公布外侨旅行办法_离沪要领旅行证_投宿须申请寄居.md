Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th—The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau announced the "Provisional Measures for Foreigners' Travel" on the 15th, which came into effect immediately. The measures stipulate that any foreigner wishing to travel from Shanghai to other liberated areas (excluding those leaving the country) must bring a photograph, fill out an application form at the Public Security Bureau, present their residence permit, and apply for a travel permit. The validity period of the travel permit is generally limited to two weeks. The maximum number of destinations allowed at one time is two, and the travel procedure should be carried out according to the locations, routes, and means of transportation approved by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. If, during the journey, it is necessary to stop or change the route and means of transportation due to illness or traffic obstacles, it can only be passed after being approved and countersigned by the local public security agency. Foreigners traveling from other locations in the liberated areas through Shanghai or coming to Shanghai, who intend to reside in Shanghai for less than two weeks, do not need to register with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau within the validity period of the original travel permit, but when lodging, the householder must report the name of the lodger to the district Public Security Branch within 24 hours and apply for temporary residence; when leaving the country, the householder must still apply to the Public Security Bureau for cancellation. Foreigners who have been approved by other foreign affairs management agencies in the liberated areas to come to Shanghai for residence for more than two weeks but less than three months, in addition to reporting to the district Public Security Branch, presenting their documents, and applying for temporary residence as required, must also complete temporary residence procedures with the Public Security Branch within seven days and surrender their original travel documents. When leaving Shanghai, in addition to reporting to the branch for cancellation of temporary residence as required, they must also apply to the Public Security Bureau for a new travel permit. Foreigners traveling in transit, if encountering special circumstances (illness or traffic obstacles) and unable to reach their final destination within the validity period of the travel permit, must declare the reasons to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau before the expiry of the permit, and the Public Security Bureau will consider the actual situation and grant a visa. Foreigners residing in Shanghai who cannot return to Shanghai from the place of travel within the approved travel period may apply to the local public security agency for approval to extend the period before the expiry date, and the original travel permit should be surrendered immediately upon returning to Shanghai. The luggage of traveling foreigners shall be subject to inspection in various places and shall not be resisted.
