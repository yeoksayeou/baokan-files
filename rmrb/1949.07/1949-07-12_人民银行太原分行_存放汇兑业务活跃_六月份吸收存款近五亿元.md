　　Deposit and Remittance Business Active
　　Nearly 500 Million Yuan in Deposits Absorbed in June
    [Taiyuan Electric] The People's Bank of China, Taiyuan Branch, has been open for a month, and its deposit, loan, and remittance businesses are becoming increasingly active. Since its official opening on June 1st, the bank has focused on attracting public and private idle funds and developing deposit business to vigorously support the recovery of industry and commerce. According to the bank's statistics for last month, it absorbed a total of 493,895,000 yuan in various deposits, including 1,863,300 yuan in fixed deposits, 349,563,642 yuan in current deposits, 115,163,660 yuan in current account deposits, and over 19 million yuan in special deposits, with the remainder being temporary and call deposits. Most of the above deposits were made by public enterprises and government agencies. Savings deposits also started last month. The bank organized five groups based on industrial categories to go to various factories to organize employee savings. Last month, a total of 370 accounts were opened, with deposits of 19,950,653 yuan. Among them, 14,261 accounts were inflation-adjusted deposits, with 54,720 inflation-adjusted units deposited. 110 accounts were currency deposits, with 8,316,662 yuan deposited. Most of the depositors were staff members, followed by workers. Last month, the bank issued various loans totaling 93,873,163 yuan, including 89,360,000 yuan in loans to public commerce and 2,500,000 yuan in loans to agriculture in the suburbs of the city. The 30 million yuan industrial and commercial loan for Taiyuan City has already begun to be issued last month, but due to the concerns of private industrial and commercial operators and the bank's insufficient initiative in organizing the issuance work, there are not many borrowers yet. As of the end of last month, loans had been issued to eleven households, totaling over 2,013,000 yuan, with most borrowers being in the cotton weaving and iron industries. Remittances are becoming more accessible, with established remittance locations in 22 places, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang, Shanghai. Eleven locations including Xi'an, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Qingdao and Nanjing are also preparing for remittances. Last month, the total amount remitted in was 149,640,000 yuan, of which Shijiazhuang accounted for 77%. The amount remitted out was 75,910,000 yuan, with the most being remitted to Tianjin. In addition, a large amount of gold and silver was purchased last month, totaling 766 taels of gold, 2,300 taels of silver, and 23,392 silver dollars.
