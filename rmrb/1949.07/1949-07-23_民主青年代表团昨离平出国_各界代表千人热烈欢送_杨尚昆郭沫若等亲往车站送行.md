Representatives of Beiping youth loudly recited their dedication: "We wish you victory and success, and hope that you will tell foreign people about the heroic struggles of the Chinese people and Chinese youth. Bring the deep friendship of the Chinese people to foreign people; at the same time, we hope that you will humbly learn from the democratic youth of various countries around the world, especially the youth of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe. Under the shining light of internationalism, unite with youth representatives from all countries and strive for a bright and happy life for youth all over the world, and for lasting world peace and people's democracy!"
    Deputy Head of the Delegation Xiao Hua spoke amidst warm applause. He said: The lineup of this youth delegation going abroad is stronger than any previous one. This shows that under the new situation of the Chinese revolution, the ranks of Chinese youth are growing stronger and more united, representing a new victory for the world democratic youth camp and the people of the world. He called on the youth, today, as the Chinese revolution approaches complete victory nationwide, to join the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao, to strive to shoulder the arduous mission of building a new China, and at the same time, to closely unite with democratic youth all over the world, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, the leader of the world peace and democracy camp, and Stalin, the leader of the people of the world, to further strengthen the unity of democratic youth all over the world, and to strive for lasting world peace and people's democracy, and for the independence of all nations and a better future for youth. He expressed that the delegation must spread the heroic struggle stories of Chinese youth on the front lines, in the liberated areas, and in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to democratic youth all over the world. Always remember Chairman Mao's instructions, be conscientious and diligent, humbly learn from the youth of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and bring back their rich experience in nation-building to help China's construction. Finally, he said enthusiastically: We will maintain contact with the youth of our motherland in every way while abroad, and we will also hear new triumphs from our motherland coming from the sky in distant Eastern Europe.
    All those who saw them off enthusiastically shouted slogans: "Bring the friendship of the Chinese people to foreign countries!" "Long live the unity of democratic youth in the world!" "People of the world unite, strive for lasting peace and people's democracy!"
    The solemn and youthful ranks of the delegation, led by majestic military music, circled the station once to bid farewell to those who were seeing them off. From their joyful faces, the strength of the new China can be fully seen.
    At 8:10, the delegation entered the carriages in formation. The workers and students who came to see them off warmly shook the hands of the delegates, and the warm concern of the youth here turned into a whole force. Until 8:20, the train left Beiping in the final whistle.
