Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: A dispatch from Warsaw on the 9th by the Polish Press Agency: The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions passed a resolution on guaranteeing peace, the democratic rights of people in all countries, and the struggle for international trade union solidarity. The resolution pointed out that despite various activities by reactionaries and right-wing leaders of British and American trade unions, the World Federation of Trade Unions still maintains its leading role in the camp of peace and democracy, effectively defending the solidarity of international trade unions. The Marshall Plan, the Western European Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty are tools of imperialists' policies of seeking world hegemony, but all these efforts have met with growing opposition. In such circumstances, the Congress adopted the following decisions: (1) Endorse the resolutions of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Paris and Prague, and actively participate in the work of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress; (2) All trade unions must expose the instigators of war and formulate action plans adapted to the needs of each country; (3) The World Federation of Trade Unions must initiate the establishment of a permanent International Day of Peace; (4) The Congress proposes to the leading bodies of trade unions in all countries to carry out systematic actions to expose the divisive and anti-labor activities carried out by the leadership of the British Trades Union Congress and the American Federation of Labor; (5) A peace declaration will be issued to workers worldwide; (6) The World Federation of Trade Unions will begin active activities to strengthen trade union solidarity, especially the solidarity of trade unions in colonies and dependent countries. The Congress emphasized that the doors of the World Federation of Trade Unions are always open to all trade unions willing to fight for the rights of workers and peace; (7) The World Federation of Trade Unions must strengthen trade union solidarity in countries where enemies of the working class attempt to split the trade union movement, such as in Germany, Japan, India, and Latin American countries; (8) The best way to overcome trade union divisions is to carry out the struggle to defend the interests of workers; (9) The authorities of the World Federation of Trade Unions should, in the struggle to defend peace, defend international trade union solidarity, and defend democratic freedom, make the widest possible use of newspapers, radio, and mass rallies; (10) The World Federation of Trade Unions and the central organizations of national trade unions should do everything possible to mobilize the broadest masses of workers to defend trade union freedom, which is being violated by bourgeois governments; (11) The Congress extends fraternal greetings to the heroic workers in China, Malaya, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Greece, who stand at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle, as well as to the democratic trade unionists in Spain, Portugal, Brazil, Argentina, India, Burma, and Iran, who are engaged in underground struggle for the interests of the working class. The Congress also extends sincere greetings to Dange, the heroic fighter imprisoned in Indian prisons for fighting for trade union rights, and to all fighters arrested in capitalist, colonial, and semi-colonial countries; (12) The World Federation of Trade Unions should help the young trade union movements in colonial countries by convening regional conferences and sending delegations to study the situation on the spot. Finally, the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on all trade union organizations, whether they belong to the World Federation of Trade Unions or not, to concentrate all their efforts to strengthen solidarity, because solidarity is the guarantee of defeating warmongers and achieving the victory of social progress and democratic freedom.

    【新华社北平十二日电】波兰通讯社华沙九日讯：世界工联第二届代表大会通过一项关于保证和平、各国人民的民主权利与国际职工会团结斗争的决议。该决议指出：尽管反动派与英美职工会右翼领导者进行了各种活动，世界工联仍在和平与民主阵营中保有其领导作用，有效地保卫着国际职工会的团结，马歇尔计划、西欧联盟与北大西洋公约是帝国主义者称霸世界政策的工具，但是这一切努力都遭到日益增长的反对。在这样的情况下，大会采取了如下决定：（一）赞同巴黎与布拉格世界拥护和平大会的决议，并且积极参加世界和平大会常设委员会的工作；（二）各职工会必须揭穿战争挑拨者，并制订适应各国需要的行动计划；（三）世界工联必须发起订立一个永久的国际和平日；（四）代表大会向各国职工会领导机构提议，进行有系统的行动，去揭破英国职工大会与美国产联领导机关所进行的分裂与反劳工的活动；（五）将向全世界工人发出和平宣言；（六）世界工联将开始为加强职工会团结，特别是殖民地与附属国职工会团结而进行积极的活动。代表大会着重指出：世界工联的大门，经常都是对愿意为工人的权利与和平而斗争的一切职工会敞开着的；（七）世界工联必须在工人阶级的敌人企图分裂职工运动的国家内，如在德、日、印度以及拉丁美洲各国，加强职工会的团结；（八）克服职工会分裂的最好方法，便是进行保卫工人利益的斗争；（九）世界工联当局在保卫和平、保卫国际职工会团结、保卫民主自由的斗争中，应尽可能广泛地利用报纸、无线电与群众集会；（十）世界工联与各全国性职工会中央机构应尽一切可能动员最广大的劳动群众，保卫正在为资产阶级政府所侵犯的职工会自由；（十一）代表大会向站在反帝斗争最前列的中国、马来亚、印尼、越南与希腊等国英勇的工人斗士，以及为工人阶级利益而从事地下斗争的西班牙、葡萄牙、巴西、阿根廷、印度、缅甸与伊朗的民主职工运动者致兄弟的敬礼。大会也向囚禁在印度监狱中的为职工会权利而斗争的英勇斗士丹吉以及在资本主义、殖民地与半殖民地各国里被捕的一切斗士致热诚的敬礼；（十二）世界工联应以召开区域性会议和派遣代表团去就地研究情况，来帮助殖民地各国年青的职工运动。最后，世界工联第二届代表大会号召属于或不属于世界工联的一切职工会组织，集中他们的一切努力，来加强团结，因为团结是战胜战争贩子、达到社会进步与民主自由之胜利的保证。
