　　Yishui Masses Enthusiastically Hand in Public Grain
  　88 Percent Completed in Twelve Days
    Jilu Yu Administrative Office Issues Instructions for Appropriate Tax Reduction
    [Chahar News] In the Yishui Special District, under the slogan of actively supporting the front, the masses enthusiastically paid the summer wheat tax. From June 15th to 27th, the entire special district had completed over 88 percent of the task. The distribution method was mostly based on Party members taking the lead in self-reporting and public discussion. In the distribution principles, each village ensured that wheat-producing households paid wheat, those with less production paid less, and those with no production paid none, while also taking care of poor, widowed, orphaned, and families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres. Because the masses recognized the importance of supporting the front lines and the distribution was reasonable, coupled with this year's conversion rate (14 liang of wheat for 1 jin of millet) being appropriate, the masses paid very enthusiastically. For example, in the sixth district of Tang County, over 110,000 jin were completed in three days, exceeding the task by over 800 jin, and in the third district of Mancheng, 130,000 jin were completed in five days, also exceeding the task. At the same time, in order to save male labor for more farm work, women also participated in the summer tax collection. The women's organization in Nangangbei, Tang County, organized to check the quality, re-winnowing any bad grain, and personally went to households to mobilize early payment of good grain. As a result, over 40,000 jin were completed in three days. The women of Shitou Village in Mancheng were driving pack animals to transport grain to the granary. Therefore, this year's summer tax collection was not only of good quality but also completed quickly, and is expected to be fully completed by July 5th.

    [Jinan Telegraph] Yuancheng farmers enthusiastically pay summer public grain. After the summer tax instructions were issued in the county, each village launched publicity and discussion among Party members and the masses, setting off a wave of wheat drying and winnowing under the influence of Party members taking the lead. On June 17th, when the wheat tax collection began, village cadres did not rest all night, and the masses lined up in droves to pay the grain. In the second district, 26 villages completed more than 284,000 jin in one morning.
    [Jilu Yu Telegraph] In accordance with the instructions of the North China People's Government, the Jilu Yu Administrative Office specifically issued a circular a few days ago, appropriately reducing the wheat tax. It stated: "In order to take care of the poor wheat harvest and the difficulties in the lives of the masses in this region, the North China Government has approved a reduction of 19.7 million jin of summer tax. It will be distributed proportionally by special district. Reduction methods: (1) A universal reduction of half a jin per mu; (2) Reduction or exemption for disaster areas and individual households in villages that are poor and lack labor. Each special district and county should take a responsible attitude towards the country and the people, earnestly investigate the disaster situation and the living conditions of the masses, and rationally distribute the reduction and exemption figures. At the same time, it should also ensure the completion of the collectible amount."

　　易水群众踊跃缴公粮
  　十二天完成百分之八十八
    冀鲁豫行署指示酌情减征
    【察哈尔讯】易水专区的群众在积极支前的口号中，踊跃交纳夏季征麦，自六月十五日到二十七日，全专区已完成百分之八十八强。分配的方法多是党员带头自报公议。各村在分配的原则上作到了产麦户交麦，少产者少交，不产不交，并照顾到贫苦孤寡、烈、军、干属。由于群众认识到支援前线的重要，和分配的合理，再加上今年的折合率（十四两麦折一斤小米）适当，群众交纳的很踊跃，如唐县六区三天完成十一万多斤，超过任务八百多斤，满城三区五天完成十三万斤也超过了任务。同时为了节省男劳力多作农活，妇女也参加了夏征。唐县南岗北妇女组织起来检查质量，见不好的就过扇车，还亲自到户动员早交，交好的。结果三天完成四万多斤，满城市头村的妇女赶着驮子往粮库运送。因此今年的夏征不仅质量好，而且交的快，七月五日即可悉数完成。

    【冀南电】元朝农民踊跃缴纳夏季公粮。该县夏征指示下达后，各村即在党员与群众中展开宣传讨论，在党员带头影响下，掀起晒麦、簸麦热潮。六月十七日麦征开始，村干整夜不休息，群众成群结队争先缴粮。二区二十六个村一个上午完成二十八万四千余斤。
    【冀鲁豫电】遵照华北人民政府指示，冀鲁豫行政公署特于日前发出通令，酌情减轻麦征。内称：华北政府为照顾本区麦季歉收与群众生活困难，核减夏征一千九百七十万斤。以专署为单位，按比例分配。减征办法：（一）每亩普遍降低半斤；（二）灾区及村中贫苦无劳动力的个别户减免。各专、县应以对国家对人民负责精神，认真调查灾情和群众生活状况，合理分配减免数字，同时，并应保证应征收额数之完成。
