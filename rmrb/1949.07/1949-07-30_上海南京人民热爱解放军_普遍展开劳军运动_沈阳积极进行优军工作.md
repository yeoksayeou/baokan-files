　　Shanghai and Nanjing People Love the People's Liberation Army
    Universally Launch Movements to Console the Troops
  　Shenyang Actively Carries Out Work to Support the Military
    [Report from this newspaper] Shanghai News: Shanghai citizens love the People's Liberation Army and are launching an enthusiastic movement to console the troops. This movement was initiated at the "July 7th" anniversary meeting in Shanghai by five organizations including the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Democratic Women's Federation, the Communist Youth League, the Student Union, and the Union of Teachers of Universities and Middle Schools, as well as leaders from the industrial sector. It immediately gained the support of the broad masses of citizens. On the 16th, the "Shanghai All Circles Comfort the People's Liberation Army General Association" was established, followed by the establishment of seven branch associations for workers, businesses, education, youth, women, literature and art, and freelancers, to oversee this work. In this surging tide of troop consolation, Shanghai workers demonstrated their high level of love for the People's Liberation Army. They issued challenges to all sectors. As of the 27th, the China Textile Corporation had received more than 7,700 consolidated savings units and more than 2 million yuan in cash. All employees of the French-owned Electricity Company contributed one day's wages, equivalent to more than 400 shi of rice, and more than 170 people are prepared to donate funds on a long-term basis until the entire country is liberated. Yong'an Factory No. 1 received more than 300,000 yuan in cash and 600 consolidated savings units in four hours. The literary and art circles, the Musicians Association, the Dramatists Association, and the Artists Association are also launching this donation movement. The business community is preparing to hold a charity sale on "August 1st." This movement, as Mayor Chen Yi said at the inaugural meeting of the General Labor Union, is completely different from the past, when the people were afraid of the Kuomintang soldiers and dared not console them. This time, it is entirely out of the people's heartfelt love for the People's Liberation Army that they have launched this consolation effort. This movement is still being widely carried out in all strata of society.
    [Broadcast from the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Nanjing, 28th Message: People from all walks of life in Nanjing have set off a wave of troop consolation, offering comfort items and Renminbi to comfort the People's Liberation Army. The workers of the Wired Radio Factory contributed a total of more than 290 towels, 81 teacups, toothbrushes, soap, shirts, books, etc., and also wrote more than 60 letters of condolence. The workers of the Nanjing Public Bus Company Repair Shop, the Liaison Association of China Agricultural Machinery Company, the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, and the Shanghai Department Store and other units contributed a total of more than 186,000 yuan in Renminbi, as well as more than 80 condolence bags. Central University, Oriental Language College and other schools launched a 50-yuan and a letter troop consolation movement. All the merchants in Yongle Mall are preparing to hold a charity sale for two days starting from the "August 1st" Uprising and donate all the profits to comfort the troops.
    [Broadcast from the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Shenyang, 29th Message: The Shenyang Municipal People's Government is actively carrying out the work of preferential treatment for the families of revolutionary soldiers to help them solve their living difficulties. In May, a total of more than 117,800 jin of grain were allocated to more than 1,250 military families. In June, another 8,900 jin of relief grain were allocated to 5,360 relatively poor military families. All possible efforts are also made to help solve difficult problems such as illness and death of military families. On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, the Municipal Government also sent cadres to the homes of revolutionary soldiers' families to conduct visits and hang honorary plaques.
