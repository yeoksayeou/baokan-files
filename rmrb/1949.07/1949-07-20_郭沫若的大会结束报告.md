The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers of China has concluded successfully today after fourteen sessions spanning twenty days.

This congress has been successful and victorious.

Through this congress, we have strengthened the unity of the literary and art circles and cultivated greater confidence and strength. We believe that all patriotic and democratic writers and artists in the country will be able to unite even more closely in the future and, together with the people of the whole country, fight to completely overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and build the People's Republic of China and a people's literature and art.

Through this congress, we exchanged many important experiences and observed many important works, which enabled us to more fully understand Mao Zedong's literary and art policy of serving the people, as well as the significant achievements gained from practicing this policy. From all aspects, especially from the liberated areas, we have proven that the mass line of integrating with the people is the only correct literary and art policy.

Through this congress, we established a unified organization for the national literary and art circles. Based on many beneficial and important proposals, our future program of literary and art work will be more focused, the content of our work will be richer, and the pace of our work will be more aligned.

These are the gains of the congress, which can be said to be gains of great historical significance.

During the meeting, the delegates fully expressed their ardent desire to serve the people and integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many literary and art workers requested in their proposals to go to factories, rural areas, and military units to live, and to reflect the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is a very good phenomenon. This kind of request is a request that conforms to the wishes of the people. The people are expecting our literary artists to portray them and educate them. We must maintain this enthusiasm and sustain it. For literary artists who have already come into contact with the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, we hope that they can go deeper into the masses and reflect the masses more and more profoundly, expressing the various new characters among the masses and the various new relationships between the masses and the leaders. For literary artists who have not had contact with the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the past, we should not demand too much too quickly, but should fully understand them and help them in various ways. Literary artists with mass life experience should support them like brothers. It is indeed not an easy task for someone who has never experienced the life of workers, peasants, and soldiers to truly integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. This requires long-term training, and sometimes may require encountering setbacks. But as long as you don't give up, you will definitely be able to integrate. Representatives can immediately go to factories, rural areas, and military units to visit, intern, and work. But if you feel that some conditions are not yet ready, you can go a little later. If you go once and are not used to the work, you can come back. You can go again after you come back. In short, don't be too reluctant, and don't be afraid to go. Some literary artists say that they want to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, so they imagine workers, peasants, and soldiers to be perfect and flawless, and go to make superficial contact with great enthusiasm. But as soon as they come into contact, they feel a little different, and as a result, they become discouraged. This kind of thing is most likely to hinder literary artists from integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. We should be more calm and comprehensive, start from reality, use the class point of view, and correctly understand workers, peasants, and soldiers. In addition, there are also some literary artists who like to observe and experience the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers from their own likes and dislikes, and use petty-bourgeois or bourgeois demands to demand workers, peasants, and soldiers, making workers, peasants, and soldiers submit to petty-bourgeois or bourgeois feelings, thoughts, and lifestyles. As a result, they become incompatible with workers, peasants, and soldiers and are ignored by workers, peasants, and soldiers. We should proceed from the demands and interests of the broad masses of working people, integrate ourselves into the broad masses of working people, and thus integrate with them, so as to express them and further educate them. Of course, these cannot be achieved all at once. This requires arduous, long-term training and several trials before it can be achieved. But as long as you have the sincere determination to serve the people and are willing to work hard, this can guarantee that you will definitely be able to do it.

At the congress, we put forward the request for literary artists to produce more and better literary and artistic works, thus encouraging a strong desire and enthusiasm for creation, which is a very good phenomenon. We should organize this creative enthusiasm and put it into practice. But on the other hand, the development of a broad mass literacy campaign in literature and art must be specially emphasized here. We must point out that developing a broad mass literacy campaign in literature and art is the main direction of our literary and art work. If we neglect popularization work, we will make a serious mistake. In fact, in the old liberated areas, especially North China, Northwest China, East China, and some areas in Northeast China, there is a broad and in-depth foundation for popularization work. In this regard, there are many literary workers who are working diligently, who have close ties with the masses, deeply know the emotions and demands of the masses, their experience is very rich, and their achievements are also remarkable. They are mostly organizers of mass literary activities. Because they have been working in rural areas for a long time, their names are not completely familiar to the literary and art circles. But their contribution, in a sense, is no less than creating excellent works. They are also an indispensable part of literary and art work. The broad mass literacy campaign in literature and art is the main foundation of our entire literary and art movement. It contains unlimited vitality and is an important source for writers to cultivate creation. The main responsibility of our literary artists is to use our works to educate the people, but we cannot unilaterally limit ourselves to this aspect. In particular, literary organizations and literary cadres that lead literary work, if they do not pay attention to leading and helping the broad masses' literacy campaign in literature and art, they will deviate from the main foundation of our work, and literary work cannot take root in the broad masses, and the creative source of writers will be cut off.

Therefore, our literary artists should not only use works that are loved and welcomed by the masses to educate the masses, but also help the masses to stand up on their own and learn to use the weapon of literature and art to educate themselves. This requires a certain process, but we must combine these two aspects and carry out our work. If professional literary writers and artists do not combine with the amateur literary activities of the broad masses, their creations may become detached from the masses. The ideological and artistic level of professional literary writers and artists in their creations must be improved along with the development and degree of the mass literary movement. Naturally, the literacy campaign in literature and art cannot develop in isolation without the guidance of professional writers. The current situation is that popularization work urgently needs a large number of professional literary workers to pay attention to, guide, and improve it. The mass amateur literary activities have their own characteristics and weaknesses. Because it is amateur, not professional, it is impossible to be very deep and detailed in its creation, and thus the educational effect will not be deep enough. Professional writers' creations can have higher ideological and artistic qualities because they are produced by professionals, so we must cherish professional writers and their creations. They are "soul engineers," and the people eagerly hope that they will create excellent and large numbers of works for the people, and the cadres in the people also eagerly hope that they will create works that they love and can educate them. Here arises the question of the self-improvement of professional literary workers. In the past, literary workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas did not have the opportunity to combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants due to the various oppressions of the reactionary rulers, and now they must step up their efforts in this regard. Since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, literary workers in the liberated areas have begun to combine with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, but due to the dispersed rural environment, the heavy workload, and the lack of sufficient learning opportunities to improve themselves, and the fact that the masses and cadres are increasingly demanding literature and art, this shows that subjective ability and objective requirements cannot be fully adapted, that is to say, literature and art are still behind the demands of the masses. Therefore, the most urgent problem facing the current literary cadres is to strengthen learning and improve their ideological and artistic level.

At our congress, many outstanding representatives of old literature and art also arrived. They all expressed their desire for enthusiastic improvement. Everyone has realized that a large part of the old literature and art with feudal content is still popular among the people. The unanimous opinion is to actively carry out the reform of old literature and art, which is one of the most important gains of the congress. We hope that friends who are engaged in new literature and art will actively participate in and promote this great reform movement.

At our congress, representatives of the Mongolian ethnic group and the Korean ethnic group in China have participated. They enthusiastically support the new literature and art policy like us. In order to enable China's new literature and art to develop in many ways, we must pay special attention to this part of the work, so that the various brotherly ethnic groups can exchange experiences, learn from each other, and jointly promote the construction of our culture and education.

Due to the victory of the national revolution, literary and art work and organizations are required to change their past methods and organizational lines that were in a dispersed rural environment. If we cannot implement this transformation, literary and art work will lag behind the demands of reality. Future literary and art work needs centralized and unified leadership, and needs to be carried out in an organized and planned manner.

One of the successes of this congress is the establishment of a unified organization for the national literary and art circles. Under the Central Government of the People's Republic of China, which will soon be established, there will be a department dedicated to the management of culture and art, which will play a major leading and promoting role in the future development of literary and art work. Therefore, the organizational leadership and administrative work in the current literary and art work are even more important for the entire literary and art work. If there are only writers and creations in literary and art work, and there are no cadres who organize literary and art work, it will make literary and art work scattered and weak, and it will not achieve the due achievements. Therefore, the organizers of literary and art work are very important. These organizers are often the masters and leaders of the ideology and policies of literary and art work. Therefore, organizers and editors are as important as writers, and they should be given the same respect and rewards.

With these gains, after this congress, our new Chinese literary and art circles will surely be able to unite more closely under Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, delve into the masses and carry out work, strive to create works that highly combine ideology and artistry, establish scientific literary and art theory criticism, and jointly strive to build a new democratic People's Republic and develop a new democratic people's literature and art.

    郭沫若的大会结束报告
    中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会，开过了十四次会议，绵延了二十天，今天圆满闭幕了。
    这次大会是成功的，胜利的。
    经过这次大会，我们加强了文艺界的团结，生长了更大的信心与力量。我们相信全国爱国的民主的文学家艺术家，今后一定能更加团结，和全国人民一起，为彻底打倒帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义，建设中华人民民主共和国和人民文学艺术而奋斗。
    经过这次大会，我们互相交换了许多重要的经验，观摩了许多重要的作品，使我们更充分地认识了毛泽东的为人民服务的文艺方针，以及由于实践这一方针而获得的重大的成就。我们从各方面，尤其从解放区，证明了与人民结合的群众路线，是唯一正确的文艺方针。
    经过这次大会，我们建立了全国文学艺术界的统一机构。根据许多有益的重要提案，我们今后的文学艺术工作纲领将更加集中，工作内容将更加丰富，工作步调将更加整齐了。
    这些都是大会的收获，可以说是有重大历史意义的收获。
    代表们在会议中，充分地表示了要为人民服务，与工农兵相结合的热烈的愿望。有很多文艺工作者在提案中要求到工厂、到农村、到部队中去生活，去反映工农兵。这是很好的现象。这种要求，是符合人民愿望的要求。人民在期待着我们的文艺家去表现他们，教育他们。我们一定要保持这种热情，使它持久下去。对于已经接触了工农兵生活的文学家、艺术家，我们希望他们能更深入群众，更多的更深刻的去反映群众，表现出群众中各种不同的新的人物，群众与领导之间的各种不同的新的关系。对于过去没有接触过工农兵生活的文学家、艺术家，我们却不要要求过急，要充分体谅他们，要多方帮助他们。有群众生活经验的文学家、艺术家们，更应该兄弟般地扶持他们。一个完全没有体验过工农兵生活的人，要真正做到和工农兵结合，的确不是一件容易事。这需要长期锻炼，有时候也许要碰些钉子。但只要不气馁，就一定能够结合得起来。代表们尽可以立即到工厂、农村、部队里去，参观、实习、工作。但如果觉得还有什么条件没有准备成熟，可以迟一点去。如果一次去了，工作不习惯，也还可以回来。回来了还可以再去。总之，不要太勉强，也不要害怕去。有些文学家、艺术家说是要为工农兵了，他们就把工农兵幻想得完美无缺，热烘烘的去作浮泛的接触。可是当他们一经接触之后，就觉得有点两样，结果就心灰意冷了。这种事情，是最容易妨碍文学家、艺术家去和工农兵结合的。我们更应该沉着的，全面的从现实出发，运用阶级观点，正确的认识工农兵。另外，也还有些文学家、艺术家，喜欢从一己的好恶去观察与体验工农兵生活，用小资产阶级或资产阶级的要求去要求工农兵，使工农兵服从小资产阶级或资产阶级的感情、思想以及生活方式。结果，就使得自己与工农兵格格不入，被工农兵所不理睬。我们应该从广大劳动人民的要求与利益出发，将自己溶化于广大劳动人民中，这样去和他们结合，才能表现他们，更进而教育他们。当然，这些都不是一下子就可做到的。这要艰苦地、长期地、经过若干磨练，才能达到。但是只要自己有诚心诚意为人民服务的决心，而且肯努力去作，这就可以保证一定能够做到。（⑴⑵）
    在大会上，我们提出了要求文学家、艺术家产生更多的更好的文学艺术作品，因而鼓励了强烈的创作欲望和热情，这是很好的现象。我们应该组织这种创作热情，见诸实行。但在另一方面，对于展开广大群众的文艺普及运动，必须在这里特别加以强调。我们必须指出：展开广大群众的文艺普及运动，是我们文艺工作的主要方向。如果我们忽视了普及的工作，我们就要犯严重的错误。事实上，在老解放区，尤其是华北、西北、华东，以及东北的若干地区，是有广泛而深入的普及工作基础的。在这一方面，有不少埋头苦干的文艺工作者，他们与群众有密切联系，深切知道群众的情绪和要求，他们的经验是很丰富的，他们的成绩也是卓越的。他们大都是群众文艺活动的组织者。由于长期分散在农村中工作，他们的名字并不完全为文艺界所熟悉。但是他们的贡献，在某种意义上来讲，并不下于创造了优秀的作品。他们同样是文艺工作上不可缺少的部分。广大群众的文艺普及运动是我们整个文艺运动的主要基础，这里蕴藏着无限的生命力，是作家们借以培育创作的重要源泉。我们文艺工作者的主要职责固然是用自己的作品去教育人民，但不能片面地局限于这一方面。特别是领导文艺工作的文艺机关与文艺干部，如果不去注意领导与帮助广大群众的文艺普及运动，那就会脱离我们工作的主要基础，文艺工作就不能在广大群众中扎下深根，作家们的创作源泉也就会断绝的。
    因此，我们的文学家、艺术家，不但要用群众所喜闻乐见的作品来教育群众，而且还要帮助群众自己起来，学会使用文艺这个武器来教育自己。这是需得有一定过程的，但我们必须把这两方面结合起来，去进行工作。专业的文学作家和艺术家如果不与广大群众业余的文艺活动相结合，其创作就有可能脱离群众。专业的文学作家和艺术家在创作上的思想水平与艺术水平，必须沿着群众文艺运动的发展状况与程度提高起来。自然，文艺普及运动是不能离开专业作家的指导而孤立发展的。现在的情况是普及工作迫切需要大量专业文艺工作者去注意，去指导，去提高。而群众业余文艺活动，有它的一定的特点和弱点。因为它是业余的，而不是专业的，首先它在创作上就不可能十分深刻与细致，因之教育作用就会不够深刻。专业作家的创作，可以有更高的思想性与艺术性，因为它是由专业产生，因此我们必须十分珍视专业作家及其创作。他们是“灵魂工程师”，人民极盼望他们给人民创作出优秀的大量的作品，人民中的干部也极盼望他们创作出为他们所爱好而又能教育他们的作品。这里就发生了专业文艺工作者本身提高的问题。以前国民党统治区的文艺工作者，由于反动统治者的种种压迫，没有可能得到与广大工农群众相结合的机会，现在必须加紧这一方面的努力了。解放区文艺工作者，自从延安文艺座谈会以后，与工农兵群众开始了结合，但由于农村环境的分散，工作任务的繁重，缺乏充分的学习机会以提高自己，而群众与干部对文艺的要求是日渐增高的，这样就表现了主观能力与客观要求还不能十分适应，就是说，文艺还落在群众要求的后面。因此摆在目前文艺干部面前最迫切的问题，便是加强学习，提高自己的思想与艺术的水平。
    在我们的大会上，旧文学艺术的优秀代表，也到了不少。他们都表示了热心改进的愿望。大家都已认识到，封建内容的旧文艺，还有很大一部分在人民中流行。大家一致的意见是积极进行旧文艺的改革工作，这是大会最重要的收获之一。我们希望从事新文艺的朋友们，积极参加并推进这一巨大的改革运动。
    在我们的大会上，已有蒙古民族及国内朝鲜民族的代表参加，他们和我们一样热烈地拥护新文艺的方针，为了使中国的新文艺能得到多方面的发展，我们要特别重视这部分的工作，使各个兄弟民族能够交换经验，互相学习，来共同促进我们文教方面的各项建设。
    由于全国革命的胜利，就要求文艺工作和组织改变它过去处于农村分散环境的方法和组织路线，如果我们不能实行这一转变，文艺工作便会落后于现实的要求。今后的文艺工作，需要有集中而统一的领导，需要有组织有计划的来进行。
    这次大会的成功之一，是成立了全国文学艺术界的统一机构。不久快要成立的中华人民民主共和国中央政府之下，将设立专管文化艺术的部门，对于将来的文艺工作的发展，必将起着重大的领导与推动作用。因此，在目前文艺工作中的组织领导和行政工作，对于整个文艺工作，就更加重要。如果文艺工作中只是作家和创作，而没有组织文艺工作的干部，那就会使得文艺工作涣散无力，得不到应有的成就。因之，文艺工作的组织者是很重要的。这些组织家，往往是文艺工作的思想与政策的掌握者、领导者。因之组织家、编辑家是和作家一样重要，他们应受到同样的尊敬和奖励。
    由于有了这些收获，在这次大会以后，我们新中国文艺界一定能够更加团结在毛主席的文艺方针之下，深入群众展开工作，努力创造思想性与艺术性高度结合的作品，建立科学的文艺理论批评，为建设新民主主义的人民共和国和展开新民主主义的人民文艺而共同奋斗。
