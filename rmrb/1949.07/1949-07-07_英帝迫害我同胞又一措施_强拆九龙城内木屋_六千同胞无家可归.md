Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th -- According to Hong Kong news: British imperialism continues to take measures to persecute the Chinese people. On the 3rd of this month, the British government dispatched a large number of police officers, carrying poison gas and other weapons, and, under the pretext of so-called danger to public health, forcibly demolished all 2,000 wooden houses in Kowloon City, leaving at least 6,000 poor Chinese people homeless. Before the houses were demolished, Chinese residents in Kowloon City had sent representatives to the British Governor of Hong Kong to request a halt to this atrocity, but they were ignored.

　　英帝迫害我同胞又一措施
  　强拆九龙城内木屋　六千同胞无家可归
    【新华社北平六日电】据香港消息：英国帝国主义继续采取迫害中国人民的措施。本月三日英政府出动大批警察，携带毒气及其他凶器，借口所谓对公共卫生的危险，将九龙城内二千座木屋全部强行拆毁，至少使六千名中国贫民无家可归。房屋被拆毁前，九龙城内中国居民曾推派代表向香港英国总督要求停止此一暴行，但被置之不理。
