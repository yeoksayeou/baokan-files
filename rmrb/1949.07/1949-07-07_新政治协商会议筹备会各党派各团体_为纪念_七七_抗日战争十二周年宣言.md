Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 6th: The Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference of various parties and groups issued the following declaration in commemoration of the twelfth anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War:

Declaration of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference by Various Parties and Groups in Commemoration of the Twelfth Anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War

Since July 7, 1937, when the Chinese nation launched the great patriotic war against Japanese aggressors, this year's "July 7th" is the most encouraging anniversary. Thanks to the victory of the People's Liberation War and the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, the various demands that our people across the country were unable to realize on a national scale during the Anti-Japanese War have now begun to be realized.

The People's Liberation War of the past three years is actually a continuation and development of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War. Twelve years ago, our people across the country first fought against the fascist aggressor forces on the Eastern Front, struggling for eight long years, undergoing great sacrifices, and finally achieving the final victory together with the Allied countries. However, as the world knows, after the end of the war, the deeply wounded Chinese people not only failed to achieve the goals of the war, but also suffered new and serious disasters. The Anti-Japanese War demanded national independence, but the US government and the Kuomintang government forced us to become slaves of American colonialism. The Anti-Japanese War demanded democratic reforms, but the US government and the Kuomintang government forced us to accept Chiang Kai-shek's fascist terror. The Anti-Japanese War demanded domestic peace after the end of the war in order to restore and develop national construction, but the US government fully supported the Kuomintang government in tearing up the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, launching a large-scale anti-people civil war, and the loss of people's lives and property was even worse than during the Japanese invasion. The reason why the American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries dared to act so perversely was because they believed that their power was greater than the power of the people. But they miscalculated. The Chinese people, who needed eight years to defeat the Japanese aggressors in collaboration with the forces of various countries, have basically defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries, mainly supported by the US government, in three years. Although the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries are still trying to make a last-ditch struggle, they will soon be completely wiped out. The Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, which represents the will of the Chinese people, has been established and will soon be able to convene the New Political Consultative Conference, form a democratic coalition government, and begin the construction of a new China.

When the Chinese people build their new country, they will of course establish diplomatic relations with all foreign governments that are willing to treat us with equality and friendship, which is in line with the interests of our country and our people. At the same time, we must of course oppose all forms of aggression and threats, which are not in line with the interests of our country and our people. In opposing various aggressions and threats, we cannot but specifically raise the issue of Japan. China is the closest to Japan, has the closest relationship with Japan, and is the country that resisted Japan the earliest, the longest, and made the greatest sacrifices. The handling of the Japanese issue must solicit China's opinion, and it is absolutely not allowed for the US government to act arbitrarily and make decisions on its own. Although China has suffered from the aggression of Japanese imperialism, the people of China and Japan are extremely willing to live in peace and establish economic and cultural cooperation on the condition that Japan implements demilitarization and democratization in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. However, this common wish of the people of China and Japan is now being obstructed, and the American imperialists who invaded China are controlling Japan. The US government's and the US command's policy towards Japan is not to implement the Potsdam Agreement but to overturn the Potsdam Agreement, not to demilitarize Japan, not to truly democratize Japan, but to anti-democratize Japan and continue militarization. The US government is unwilling to quickly sign a peace treaty with Japan, but attempts to indefinitely delay the peace treaty with Japan, indefinitely occupy Japan, so that Japan cannot establish peaceful relations with China and other foreign countries, but can only become a colony and military base of the United States. Obviously, this reactionary policy of the US government directly threatens the Chinese people, and also directly threatens the Japanese people, and seriously exploits the Japanese people. As we commemorate the twelfth anniversary of the great Anti-Japanese War, we, the various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic forces in China, believe that it is necessary to draw the attention of the world: in order to finally realize the goals of the Anti-Japanese War, we unanimously demand the rapid signing of a peace treaty with Japan; we unanimously advocate that in preparing for the peace treaty with Japan, we must strictly abide by the procedures stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement that it be prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers, and that the democratic coalition government produced by the New Political Consultative Conference of China must send China's plenipotentiary representatives.

There are still difficulties on the road ahead for the Chinese people, but no difficulties can stop our progress. Our struggle has never been isolated and helpless. In the international democratic camp, we have our powerful allies, first and foremost the Soviet Union, followed by the new democratic countries, the people of all colonies and semi-colonies struggling for independence, and the people of the world struggling for peace and democracy. The strength of the international democratic camp is increasingly greater than the strength of the imperialist camp. Although the imperialist camp fully supports the Kuomintang reactionaries, it has no power to stop the victory of the Chinese people. Although the imperialist camp has signed the North Atlantic Treaty, which is preparing for a new war of aggression, it has no power to stop the victory of the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomacy, such as the recent agreements on the principle of German unification and the Austrian peace treaty at the Council of Foreign Ministers. Although the imperialist camp is trumpeting the so-called Marshall Plan, it has no power to stop the outbreak of the economic crisis in the United States and Britain, which is already very close. The direction of the world's development is determined by the anti-imperialist peace and democratic forces, not by imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries. Imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries have now lost the initiative, are in a passive position, and are heading towards the grave of their own burial. Let the people of all China unite, let the people of the world unite, and strive to overthrow the imperialist aggressors and win world peace and democracy.

### 新政治协商会议筹备会各党派各团体  为纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年宣言

　　新政治协商会议筹备会各党派各团体  为纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年宣言
    【新华社北平六日电】新政治协商会议筹备会各党派各团体为纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年发表宣言如下：
    新政治协商会议筹备会各党派各团体为纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年宣言
    自从一九三七年七月七日我中华民族向日本侵略者进行伟大的爱国战争以来，今年的“七七”是最令人欢欣鼓舞的一次纪念。由于人民解放战争的胜利，由于新政治协商会议筹备会的成立，我全国人民在抗日战争中所没有能够在全国范围内实现的种种要求，现在都已开始实现了。
    三年来的人民解放战争，实际上是八年抗日战争的继续发展。我全国人民在十二年前首先向法西斯侵略势力的东方战线作战，奋斗八年之久，经历重大牺牲，终于与盟国共同取得了最后胜利。但是举世皆知，在战争结束以后，创巨痛深的中国人民，不但没有达到战争的目的，而且遭受了新的严重的灾难。抗日战争要求民族独立，但是美国政府和国民党政府强迫我们做美国殖民地的奴隶。抗日战争要求民主改革，但是美国政府和国民党政府强迫我们接受蒋介石的法西斯恐怖。抗日战争要求在战争结束以后实现国内和平，以便恢复和发展国家的建设，但是美国政府以全力支持国民党政府撕毁停战协定和政治协商会议的决议，发动大规模的反人民内战，人民生命财产的损失比在日本侵略期间有过之无不及。美国帝国主义者和国民党反动派之所以敢于如此倒行逆施，是认为他们的力量大过人民的力量。但是他们计算错了。需要八年时间协同各国力量才战胜日本侵略者的中国人民，经过三年时间就基本上战胜了主要由美国政府所支持的国民党反动派。现在国民党反动派的残余力量虽然仍图最后挣扎，但是已经不要很久就可以全部肃清。代表中国人民意志的新政治协商会议筹备会已经成立，不久就可以召集新政治协商会议，产生民主联合政府，着手新中国的建设工作。
    中国人民在建设自己的新国家的时候，当然要和一切愿意以平等友好态度对待我们的外国政府建立外交关系，这是与我们的国家和人民的利益相符合的。同时，我们当然要反对一切方式的侵略和威胁，这些是与我们的国家和人民的利益不相符合的。在反对各种侵略和威胁的时候，我们不能不特别提出日本的问题。中国是离日本最近，与日本关系最密切，并且是抵抗日本最早最久牺牲最大的国家，处理日本问题必须征求中国的意见，决不允许由美国政府一意孤行，擅作决定。中国虽然受了日本帝国主义的侵略，但是中日两国的人民却极愿意在日本按照波茨坦协定实行非军国主义化而且是民主化的条件下和平相处，建立经济的和文化的合作。不过，中日两国人民的这种共同愿望现在却受着阻挠，侵略中国的美国帝国主义者正在控制着日本。美国政府和美国统帅部的对日政策不是执行波茨坦协定而是推翻波茨坦协定，不是使日本非军国主义化，不是使日本真正地民主化，而是使日本反民主化，继续军国主义化。美国政府不愿意迅速签订对日和约，而企图无限期地拖延对日和约，无限期地占领日本，使日本不能与中国和其他外国建立和平关系，而只能成为美国的殖民地和军事基地。显然地，美国政府的这种反动政策直接威胁着中国人民，也直接威胁着日本人民，而且很严重地剥削日本人民。当我们纪念伟大的抗日战争的十二周年的时候，我们中国各民主党派，各人民团体和各界民主力量认为必须引起全世界注意：为了最后实现抗日战争的目的，我们一致要求迅速签订对日和约；我们一致主张在准备对日和约的时候，必须严格地遵照波茨坦协定所规定的由四国外长会议准备的程序，并且必须由中国新政治协商会议所产生的民主联合政府派遣中国的全权代表。
    在中国人民今后的道路上不是没有困难的，但是没有什么困难能够阻止我们的前进。我们的奋斗从来不是孤立无援的。在国际民主阵营中间，有我们强大的同盟军，这首先就是苏联，其次就是各新民主国家，各殖民地半殖民地为独立而奋斗的人民，和全世界为和平民主而奋斗的人民。国际民主阵营的力量，愈来愈大地超过帝国主义阵营的力量。帝国主义阵营虽然全力援助国民党反动派，却没有力量阻止中国人民的胜利。帝国主义阵营虽然签订准备新侵略战争的北大西洋公约，却没有力量阻止苏联和平外交的胜利，例如在最近的四国外长会议上关于德国统一原则问题和对奥和约问题所成立的协议。帝国主义阵营虽然大吹大擂地实行所谓马歇尔计划，却没有力量阻止美英等国经济危机的爆发，这个爆发的时间已经很迫近了。世界的发展方向，决定于反帝国主义的和平民主力量，不决定于帝国主义和各国反动派。帝国主义和各国反动派现已丧失主动，处于被动，正在向着埋葬自己的坟墓走去。全中国人民团结起来，全世界人民团结起来，为打倒帝国主义侵略分子争取全世界的和平民主而奋斗。
