Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 28th: According to a Warsaw dispatch from New York on July 28th, Washington sources predict that due to the opposition and skepticism of many senators towards the military plan, Acheson intends to make sensational remarks to deceive and intimidate public opinion, so that his policy can be implemented. American commentators believe that the US government will try its best to create tension, even fabricate a so-called defense crisis, in order to force Congress to pass Truman's armament plan.

　　This revelation by the Polish News Agency has been confirmed by a United Press dispatch from Washington on July 26th. The dispatch claims that the US government is preparing to publish a "secret report on American espionage," fabricating that the Soviet Union is "preparing for war," "to support Truman's arms aid to Europe plan."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 29th: TASS Washington dispatch: Although the US government is urging Congress to quickly pass the arms plan to implement the North Atlantic Military Alliance, the remarks of many congressmen and news reports show that this plan will be greatly opposed in Congress. This is the result of the masses' clear hostility to the Atlantic Pact and the armament plan. Senator Taft, in a statement to the press, criticized Truman's proposal, saying that these proposals would enable representatives of the State Department and the Department of Defense to create alliances that would involve the United States in world wars. Taft said: "The plan proposed by the President and the bill to implement this plan require Congress to completely abandon all powers over foreign policy and authorize the State Department and the Department of Defense to create alliances all over the world and involve us in all wars in any part of the world—civil wars or foreign wars. Based on the President's arbitrary decision, he can provide arms assistance to any country or government, whether in Europe, Asia, Africa, or the Americas.” Taft continued: "Even without new appropriations, the President clearly has the right to give any property of any department of the government—except for atomic bombs and merchant ships—to any foreign country. I doubt whether any president has ever asked for such great power in war or peace." Even Vandenberg, the strongest advocate of the North Atlantic Military Alliance, seems to have anticipated considerable opposition and suggested that Truman's proposals must be revised in order to reach a resolution in this session of Congress. Vandenberg said: "The armament plan must be revised and its cost reduced in order to be passed by this session of Congress." Some other senators also supported Vandenberg's proposal to pass a "temporary" plan in this session of Congress, while the long-term plan would be left to the next session of Congress. Democratic Senator George predicted that Congress would reject Truman's proposal in this session. George said that Congress may now pass a temporary plan of at most 300 to 400 million dollars.

　　The author continued: The division within the US ruling clique on the issue of arming the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty is undoubtedly a reflection of the increasing friction within the imperialist camp. The impending economic crisis is an increasingly serious problem in domestic and foreign markets, which has led to demands to revise the methods used in current foreign policy, which has caused huge expenditures to arm the United States and its vassal states.

　　Taft expressed extreme doubt as to whether Western European countries would actually use American weapons in the manner desired by the advocates of the North Atlantic Treaty. He emphasized that assuming the obligation to provide armed support to Western European countries would be "most inconvenient" for the United States if a truly democratic government came to power in any Western European country.

　　It is obvious that the upsurge of democratic movements in various countries of the world (including the North Atlantic signatory countries) is an international factor that no reactionary, no matter how blind, can ignore.

　　为军备计划找借口美帝虚构国防危机
    【新华社北平二十八日电】据波兰通讯社纽约二十八日电引华盛顿人士预料：由于军备计划遇到许多参议员的反对和怀疑，艾奇逊打算发表耸人听闻的言论，借以欺骗和恐吓舆论，使他的方针能够实行。美国评论家们相信：美国政府将竭力制造紧张局面，甚至虚构什么国防危机，以便强使国会通过杜鲁门的武装计划。
    波兰通讯社这一揭露，已为合众社华盛顿二十六日电所证实。该电声称：美政府刻正准备发表美国“特务工作的秘密报告”，捏造苏联“正在备战”，“用以支持杜鲁门的武装援欧计划”。
    【新华社北平二十九日电】塔斯社华盛顿讯：虽然美国政府敦促国会尽速通过实施北大西洋军事联盟的武装计划，但许多议员的言论与新闻报道，都显示这个计划将在国会中受到很大的反对。这是群众明白地敌视大西洋公约及武装计划的结果。参议员塔夫脱在对报界声明中，斥责杜鲁门的建议说：这些建议会使国务院和国防部的代表们能够制造将美国牵入世界战争中的联盟。塔夫脱说：“总统所提出的计划以及实行这个计划的法案，要求国会根本放弃关于外交政策的一切职权，而授权国务院与国防部制造遍及全世界的联盟，并将我们牵入世界上任何地方进行的一切战争——内战或外战之中。凭着总统专断的决定，他可以给任何国家或政府以武器援助，不论是在欧洲、亚洲、非洲或美洲。”塔脱夫继称：“即使不再有新的拨款，总统显然也有权将政府任何部门的任何财产——仅原子弹与商船除外——送给任何外国。我怀疑无论在战时或平时，是否有过任何总统要求过这样大的权力”。甚至倡议大西洋军事联盟最力的范登堡，似乎由于预料到相当大的反对，也建议为了在本届国会会议中获致决议，必须修正杜鲁门的建议。范登堡说：“武装计划必须重订并削减其费用，才能获得本届国会会议的通过。”别的一些参议员也支持范登堡的建议，在本届国会会议中通过“临时”计划，长期计划则留待下次国会会议。民主党参议员乔治预言：国会将在本届会议中否决杜鲁门的建议。乔治说：国会现在可能通过至多三亿至四亿元的临时计划。
    作者继称：美国统治集团在武装北大西洋公约签字国的问题上发生了分歧，无疑是帝国主义阵营内部摩擦日益增加的反映。即将到来的经济危机，是国内和国外市场上日益严重的问题，这个问题引起了修改目前外交政策所使用的方法的要求，目前的外交政策的方法，引起了巨大的开支来武装美国和它的附庸国。
    塔夫脱对于西欧国家是否会真正照着北大西洋公约倡导者所希望的方式去使用美国武器，极表怀疑。他强调指出：承担以武装支持西欧国家的义务，对美国是“最不方便的”，如果真正的民主政府在任何一个西欧国家掌了权的话。
    显而易见，世界各国（包括北大西洋签字国在内）民主运动的高涨，是任何一个最盲目的反动分子也不能忽视的国际因素。
