Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 20th: The journal "For a Lasting Peace, For a People's Democracy," published on July 15th, dedicated pages one and two to articles and reports commemorating the outstanding leader of the international working class, Dimitrov, as well as speeches by leaders of Communist and Workers' Parties from various countries at the memorial service in Sofia. In addition to recounting Dimitrov's glorious life of struggle for the cause of the international working class, the editorial stated: "Comrade Dimitrov placed the party, as the leading force of the working class, above everything else. In order to turn Bolshevik principles into action, he fought consistently and always cared about improving the theoretical level of cadres and the political education of party members. In all his work, he emphasized the importance of using the experience of the Bolshevik Party as guidance." He once said: "In our opinion, a person cannot be a true Marxist unless he is a true Leninist; and a person cannot be a true Leninist unless he is a true Stalinist."

  　撰论纪念季米特洛夫
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】七月十五日出版的“争取持久和平与人民民主”，以一、二两版登载纪念国际工人阶级卓越领袖季米特洛夫的文章、通讯以及在索非亚追悼会上各国共产党和工人党领袖的演说。本期社论除了追述季米特洛夫一生为国际工人阶级事业奋斗的光辉史迹外，并称：“季米特洛夫同志把作为工人阶级领导力量的党，放在高于一切的地位。为了使布尔什维克的原则变成行动，他贯彻始终地奋斗着，并且经常关怀着提高干部的理论水平和党员的政治教育。在一切工作中，他强调以布尔什维克党的经验作为指导的重要性”。他曾说过：“在我们看来，一个人除非他是一个真正的列宁主义者，否则就不能成为真正的马克思主义者；一个人如果他不是一个真正的斯大林主义者，他就不能成为真正的列宁主义者”。
