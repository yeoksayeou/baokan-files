Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd -- The U.S. authorities' plot to occupy Japan long-term has been formally confirmed by a statement from U.S. Under Secretary of the Army Forrestal. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington, Forrestal declared before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee on June 27 that the U.S. "occupation of Japan will continue for a considerable period." To this end, the U.S. authorities have requested Congress to allocate another ten billion dollars to "aid" the Japanese government and cover occupation-related expenses. When asked by a member of congress how long the War Department hoped to occupy Japan, Forrestal surprisingly answered: "No one knows how long it will take."

　　美帝阴谋长期侵占日本
  　已在伏利斯声明中正式证实
    【新华社北平三日电】美国当局企图长期占领日本的阴谋，已由美陆军部次长伏利斯的声明而得到正式的证实。据美联社华盛顿讯，伏利斯六月二十七日，在美参院拨款委员会上宣称：美国“对日占领将继续一颇长时期”。为此，美当局已要求议会再拨十亿美元，作为“援助”日本政府及与占领有关的费用。当议员询问陆军部希望占领日本多久时，伏利斯竟答称：“没有人知道要多久。”
