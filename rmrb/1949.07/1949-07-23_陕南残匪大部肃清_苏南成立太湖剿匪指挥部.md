　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd: Since mid-May, the people's armed forces in various parts of southern Shaanxi have launched military suppression campaigns in conjunction with political offensives. As of June 15th, within a month, a total of 13 major and minor bandit leaders were killed, wounded, or captured, and 31 were persuaded to surrender. 193 bandits were killed or captured, more than 750 were persuaded to hand over their weapons and register, and 130 people coerced by the bandits returned home to resume their livelihoods. Over 950 rifles and machine guns were seized. Currently, most of the bandits in inland southern Shaanxi have been eliminated, and people's democratic power has been initially established. In the process of suppression, the troops correctly implemented the bandit suppression policy, always caring for the masses who suffered from banditry, returning the plundered cattle to their original owners, and using the captured knives and spears and collected scrap iron to cast shovels, hoes, and farm implements to help the masses restore production, which was deeply supported by the people of various places. The people in various places actively reported the activities of the bandits to the troops and voluntarily organized to assist in capturing scattered bandits.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd: In order to quickly and thoroughly eliminate the remnant bandits hiding in Taihu Lake, the Southern Jiangsu Military Region of the People's Liberation Army specially established the Taihu Lake Bandit Suppression Headquarters on the 10th of this month, and set up sub-headquarters in Suzhou, Changzhou, and Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, to unifiedly command the bandit suppression forces in the three districts of Su, Chang, and Hu, as well as the county and district armed forces of seven counties along the lake, including Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Wujiang, Yixing, Changxing, and Wuxing, to actively carry out suppression. Banditry in Taihu Lake has never stopped for decades; after the complete liberation of Southern Jiangsu, some Kuomintang bandits and scattered soldiers sneaked into Taihu Lake again, colluding with the original Taihu Lake habitual bandits, wandering and looting, disrupting public security, and endangering the people.
