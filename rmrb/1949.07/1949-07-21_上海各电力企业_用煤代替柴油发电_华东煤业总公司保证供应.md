　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th - Shanghai's power companies have begun using coal to generate electricity, replacing imported diesel fuel, with the required coal supply guaranteed by the large-scale supply from the East China Coal Industry Corporation. Currently, all eighteen boilers at the American-owned Shanghai Power Company are using coal, and five oil-fired boilers are also planned to be gradually converted to coal. Since June 16th, the ratio of diesel to coal usage at the company has changed to 20:80, whereas before liberation, it was 80:20. The company's power supply accounts for 85 percent of Shanghai's industrial power consumption, with a peak generating capacity of 170,000 kilowatts. Another private enterprise, the Zhabei Hydroelectric Company, currently has five boilers using coal as fuel, with the East China Coal Corporation allocating 5,000 tons of coal to them monthly at a low price. The No. 8 boiler, which used diesel fuel before liberation, has now been shut down, saving 3,000 tons of diesel fuel per month. In addition to the above two power companies, the Shanghai Waterworks Company, China General Edison Company, Shanghai Gas Company, and China Textile Industries Corporation also receive monthly coal allocations from the East China Coal Corporation.

  　用煤代替柴油发电
  　华东煤业总公司保证供应
    【新华社上海二十日电】上海电力企业已开始用煤来发电，以代替来自外国的柴油，其所需煤炭已因华东区煤业总公司的大量供应而获得保证。现美商上海电力公司已有十八座锅炉全部用煤，五座油炉亦拟逐步改造为用煤开动。该公司自六月十六日起柴油与煤的使用量已变为二十比八十，而在解放前，柴油与煤的使用量则为八十比二十。按该公司供电量占全上海市动力用电的百分之八十五，最高发电量曾达十七万千瓦。另一私营的闸北水电公司目前亦已有五座锅炉用煤作燃料，每月由华东煤炭总公司低价配给煤五千吨。解放前用柴油作燃料的八号锅炉现已停开，每月可节省柴油三千吨。除上述两电力公司外，由华东煤炭总公司每月配给煤的尚有上海自来水公司、华商电气公司、上海煤气公司及中纺公司。
