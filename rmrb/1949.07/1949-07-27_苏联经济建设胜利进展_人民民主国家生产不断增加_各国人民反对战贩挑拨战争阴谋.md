Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25th.

　　While the specter of a new economic crisis is haunting the capitalist world, and capitalist countries are tormented by their internal irreconcilable contradictions and conflicts, the socialist Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries of the West and the East are steadily completing and exceeding their economic plans, their production is constantly increasing, the material and cultural living standards of the people are constantly improving, and their economic cooperation is becoming increasingly close.
　　Among these countries, the victorious progress of Soviet economic construction is particularly noteworthy. The achievements of Soviet economic construction in the second quarter of this year are concentrated in the production summary communiqué released by the Soviet Central Statistical Bureau. The communiqué announced that although the Soviet Union's industrial production plan for the second quarter of this year was expanded due to new circumstances, this expanded plan was still achieved by 101 percent. The total increase in industrial output in the second quarter of this year increased by 20 percent compared with the second quarter of last year. The sown area of ​​crops in collective farms, state farms, and individual farmers this year has increased by nearly six million hectares compared with last year. In June of this year, the average daily industrial output exceeded the average level of the pre-war year of 1940 by 41 percent. Regarding the significance of the last statistic, Pravda pointed out: This is a great victory, which shows that the Soviet Union's industry has rapidly approached the average daily output of the last year of the Five-Year Plan (1950). "The results of production in the second quarter of 1949 prove that great achievements have been made in the steady progress of the Soviet national economy, and also prove that the material and cultural standards of the Soviet people have been improved." (Soviet Central Statistical Bureau)
　　In terms of economic construction, the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries has provided enormous assistance to the People's Democratic countries. In order to facilitate the rapid development of industry, transportation, and agriculture in the People's Democratic countries, the Soviet Union is supplying them with goods suitable for these requirements. The delivery of Soviet machinery and raw materials is of decisive value for the economic development of the People's Democratic countries. The volume of trade between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is increasing year by year; the latter obtains technical assistance from the Soviet Union and purchases goods from the Soviet Union at prices lower than those on the world market. "The working people of the People's Democratic countries, through cooperation with the Soviet Union, have strengthened the socialist factors in their economies and have obtained effective assistance in laying the foundations of socialism." (New Times Magazine)
　　People's Democratic Poland has completed and exceeded the basic tasks of the national economic plan for the first half of 1949 in the first half of this year. The nationalized industry, which plays a leading role in the industrial field, has exceeded the value stipulated in the plan by 9 percent. This year, more than 14 million hectares of arable land throughout Poland have been planted. When the Polish people celebrate the fifth anniversary of the country's rebirth, the total output of the national economy has exceeded the pre-war level by 50 percent; and the average industrial output per person has doubled compared with before the war. This is an extremely important achievement for the new Poland. In the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, industrial production in the first half of this year also exceeded the plan. Steel production increased by 65 percent compared with the second half of last year. As a result of the development of production, prices have been reduced for the second time in six weeks, and shops are allowed to sell food and consumer goods freely. TASS pointed out: "The reduction in prices proves the further success of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany in restoring a peaceful economy and strengthening the German Bank of Issue mark." In Czechoslovakia, the harvesting of abundant agricultural products has begun throughout the country. The import surplus of foreign trade in the first six months of this year has been greatly reduced compared with the same period last year. In North Korea, the working people have also created new production records, and salt production completed the annual plan on July 14. In Bulgaria, the national economic development plan for the third quarter of this year has been published. The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has recently taken measures to strengthen agricultural production cooperatives.
　　While the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are actively engaged in domestic economic construction, the imperialist countries are continuing to prepare for provocative wars. The US Senate passed the approval of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty on the 21st. The Dutch and Italian Houses of Representatives also recently passed this treaty, which is now being submitted to the Senates of these two countries for discussion. The French National Assembly is also debating it. So far, the countries whose parliaments have approved this treaty under the manipulation of the reactionaries include Canada, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and the United States. However, the approval of this treaty by any parliament is only the reactionaries' own approval of their own behavior. The people of these countries have never approved it. The people of these countries (whether France, Italy, Britain, or the United States) and their loyal representatives have resolutely launched mass protests against the North Atlantic Treaty from the beginning, both inside and outside the parliament, and this protest movement has achieved significant success. In the nest where the North Atlantic Treaty was born—the United States—protest letters were sent in every day when the Senate discussed the Atlantic Treaty, and finally, even 13 senators voted against it during the vote. Some key figures in the Republican Party, such as Taft and Wherry, also opposed unconditionally approving the treaty during the debate on approving the treaty. They were afraid of shouldering military and economic obligations to Western Europe and were unwilling to invest money in such an unreliable business. The fierce quarrels in the US Senate when voting to approve the treaty show that the plans of the US war-mongers are encountering increasing obstacles and difficulties.
　　The London dockworkers' strike ended on the 22nd due to the Canadian Seamen's Union's announcement of the cancellation of the strike in London. The dockworkers have achieved a major victory in resisting the employers' unreasonable refusal to hire and the government's strong suppression. Although the British government announced a "state of emergency" on July 11, the scale of the strike expanded day by day and received increasingly broad support from the domestic and international working class. In this strike struggle, the dockworkers showed the spirit of internationalist solidarity. The Australian coal miners' strike is still ongoing. Although the Australian government has successively imposed fines and imprisonment on trade unions and trade union leaders who support the coal miners' strike in an attempt to suppress the strike, this reactionary measure has not only failed to subdue the workers, but has instead aroused broader resistance. The Federal Dockworkers' Union has decided to strike for 24 hours every Monday to protest the government's sentencing of the union's leaders. The coal miners also maintain their past position that they will never resume work until all demands are met. The strike of millions of construction workers in Italy is persisting and expanding, and has now spread throughout Italy. The Hawaiian dockworkers' strike to demand increased wages has persisted for more than 83 days. Four thousand industrial and dock workers in Tel Aviv and Jaffa, the capital of Israel, launched a strike on the 19th, despite government suppression, demanding increased wages.
　　According to the disclosure by the Supreme Command of the Greek Democratic Army and the General Secretary of the Greek Communist Party, Zachariadis, in the battle of Kaimakchalan in northern Greece on July 5, the Tito group condoned the Greek royalist fascist army to attack the Greek Democratic Army from behind via Yugoslav territory. The alliance between the Tito group and the Greek executioner Tsaldaris did not save the decline of the Athens petty court. The offensive of the royalist fascist army in Kaimakchalan was defeated by the Greek Democratic Army within ten days. However, the Tito group's face as a running dog of US and British imperialism was undoubtedly exposed in this move. After this, on July 10, Tito openly announced that he would close the southern Greek border, and at the same time claimed that he was begging the US and Britain for loans. Loan negotiations between Tito and American bankers are underway. The Tito group plans to sell lead mines, copper mines, and the country together to imperialism. The Tito group, which is increasingly brazenly opposing the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and democratic Greece, is increasingly madly suppressing the resisting masses at home. According to Yugoslav political exiles, the Tito group has turned Yugoslavia into a bloody concentration camp. Tens of thousands of people who oppose Tito's betrayal of the country and demand to return to the peaceful and democratic camp are being imprisoned, abused, and executed. Only one year after the Communist Information Bureau announced its resolution on the Tito group, the facts have been sufficient to prove that the Tito group is an out-and-out imperialist hound. The Yugoslav people are actively rising up to fight against this new traitorous group.

### 苏联经济建设胜利进展　人民民主国家生产不断增加  各国人民反对战贩挑拨战争阴谋

　　苏联经济建设胜利进展
  　人民民主国家生产不断增加
    各国人民反对战贩挑拨战争阴谋
    当新的经济危机的幽灵正踯躅在资本主义世界，资本主义各国正为其内部不可调和的矛盾和冲突熬煎着的时候，社会主义的苏联与西方、东方的人民民主国家，却正在有条不紊地完成并超过它们的经济计划，生产量正不断增加，人民的物质与文化生活水平正不断提高，它们之间的经济合作正日益亲密。
    在这些国家中，特别引人注意的，是苏联经济建设的胜利进展。苏联今年第二季经济建设的成就，集中表现在苏联中央统计局发布的生产总结公报上。公报宣布：苏联今年第二季的工业生产计划，虽因新的情况加以扩大，但这一扩大了的计划，仍然达到了百分之一○一。今年第二季的全部工业增产量，和去年第二季相较、增加了百分之二十。今年集体农场、国家农场与个体农户作物的播种面积，较去年已增加几达六百万公顷。今年六月份，每日平均工业产量超过战前一九四零年的平均水平百分之四十一。关于最后一个统计数字的意义，真理报指出：这是一个巨大的胜利，这表明苏联的工业已迅速接近五年计划最后一年（一九五○年）的每日平均产量了。“一九四九年第二季生产的成果，证明在苏联国民经济的稳步进展中，已获得巨大的成就，也证明苏联人民的物质与文化水平又得到提高。”（苏联中央统计局）
    在经济建设上，苏联与人民民主国家的合作，给予了人民民主国家巨大的帮助。为了有利于人民民主国家的工业、运输及农业的迅速发展，苏联正供给他们适合这些要求的商品。苏联机器与原料的交货，对人民民主国家的经济发展，是有决定性价值的。苏联与人民民主国家之间的贸易量，一年比一年增加；后者从苏联那里取得技术上的援助，并以低于世界市场的价格从苏联购货。“人民民主国家的劳动人民，由于和苏联合作，从而加强了它们经济方面的社会主义因素，并且在奠定社会主义的基础方面，获得了有效的帮助。”（新时代杂志）
    人民民主的波兰，今年上半年已完成并超过了一九四九年国民经济计划所规定的上半年的基本任务，在工业领域中起领导作用的国有化工业，已超过计划中所规定的价值百分之九。今年，全波兰一千四百多万公顷的耕地都已种上。当波兰人民庆祝祖国新生五周年的时候，国民经济的总生产量已超过战前水平百分之五十；而每人的平均工业生产量，较之战前则已增加了一倍。这是新波兰极其重要的成就。在德境苏占区，今年上半年的工业生产也超过了计划。钢产量比去年下半年增加了百分之六十五。由于发展生产的结果，六周以来已经第二次减低物价，并允许商店食品与消费品自由出售。塔斯社指出：“物价的减低证明德境苏占区恢复和平经济与加强德国发行银行马克的进一步成功。”在捷克斯洛伐克，全国各地已开始丰盛的农产品的收获工作。本年度头六个月对外贸易的入超，已较去年同期大为减少。在北朝鲜，劳动人民也创造了新的生产纪录，盐产量已在七月十四日完成了全年计划。在保加利亚，今年第三季的国民经济发展计划已经发表。保农业部最近亦采取加强农业生产合作社的措施。
    当苏联和人民民主国家正在积极地从事国内经济建设时，帝国主义国家则正在继续进行挑拨战争的准备工作。美参院已于二十一日通过批准侵略性的北大西洋公约。荷兰与意大利的众院，也于最近通过了这个公约，现正交由这两个国家的参院讨论中。法国国民议会亦正在辩论中。迄今为止，经过反动派操纵的议会批准这个公约的国家，已有加拿大、比利时、英国、卢森堡、挪威、丹麦、冰岛与美国。但是，不论那一个议会的这种批准，只是反动派自己对自己行为的批准而已。这些国家的人民绝未批准它。这些国家（不论是法、意、英、美）的人民及其忠实的代表，从最初起，不论在国会内外，就坚决地发动了群众性的反对北大西洋公约的抗议运动，这个抗议运动已经获得了重大的成就。在北大西洋公约产生的巢穴——美国，当参院讨论大西洋公约时，每天都有抗议书送入，最后在表决时，甚至参议员中也有十三人投反对票。共和党的一部分要角塔夫脱、惠利之流在辩论批准公约之时，也反对无保留地批准这个公约，他们害怕替西欧负担军事义务和经济义务，不愿把钱投到这样靠不住的买卖上去。美国参院在表决批准公约时的激烈争吵，显示美国战争贩子的计划，正遭到愈来愈大的阻碍与困难。
    伦敦码头工人的罢工，已因加拿大海员工会宣布取消在伦敦的罢工而于二十二日宣告结束。码头工人在对抗雇主的无理拒雇与政府的强力镇压中，已取得了重大的胜利。英国政府虽然在七月十一日宣布了“紧急状态”，但是，罢工规模反而一天比一天扩大，并且得到国内与国际工人阶级日益广泛的支持。在这次罢工斗争中，码头工人显示了国际主义的团结精神。澳大利亚煤矿大罢工仍在坚持中。澳政府虽接连对支持煤矿罢工的工会与工会领袖判处罚金与徒刑，企图以此镇压罢工，但是，这一反动措施不仅丝毫不能使工人屈服，反而引起了更广泛的反抗。联邦码头工会已决定每星期一罢工二十四小时，以抗议政府对该工会领袖的判刑。煤矿工人亦坚持其过去的立场，即一切要求未满足前决不复工。意大利百万建筑工人的罢工，正在坚持并扩大中，现在已蔓延至全意各地。夏威夷的码头工人，为要求增加工资而进行的罢工，坚持已逾八十三天。以色列首都特拉维夫和雅法港的四千产业和码头工人，不顾政府的镇压，在十九日发动了罢工，要求增加工资。
    据希腊民主军最高统帅部和希共总书记萨查利阿第斯揭露，在七月五日希腊北部开马克加兰战役中，铁托集团曾纵容希腊保皇法西斯军假道南斯拉夫领土，背击希腊民主军。铁托集团与希腊刽子手曹达利斯的联盟，并没有挽回雅典小朝廷的颓势，保皇法西斯军在开马克加兰的攻势，在十天以内就被希腊民主军击溃了。但是，铁托集团充当美英帝国主义走狗的面目，却在这一举动中暴露无疑了。在这之后，七月十日，铁托曾公开宣布要封闭南希边境，同时并宣称正向美英乞求贷款。铁托与美国银行家之间的贷款谈判正在进行中。铁托集团是打算把铅矿、铜矿和国家一起出卖给帝国主义的。日益无耻地反对苏联、反对人民民主国家、反对民主希腊的铁托集团，正日益疯狂地在国内镇压反抗的群众。据南斯拉夫政治流亡者揭发，铁托集团已把南斯拉夫变成一座血腥的集中营。成千成万反对铁托卖国、要求回到和平民主阵营的人们，正在横遭监禁、虐待和处死。共产党情报局公布对铁托集团的决议不过一年，事实已足够证明铁托集团是不折不扣的帝国主义鹰犬。南斯拉夫人民正积极起来为反对这个新的叛国集团而斗争。
