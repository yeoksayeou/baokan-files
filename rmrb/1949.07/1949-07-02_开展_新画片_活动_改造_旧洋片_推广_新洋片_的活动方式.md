　　Launch "New Picture Show" Activities
  　—Transforming "Old Foreign Picture Shows" and Promoting "New Foreign Picture Shows"—

    "Foreign Picture Shows," also called "Western Scenes," were in the past always regarded as entertainment for the "lower classes." Their content, apart from being boring scenery and portraits, also included low-grade, even obscene and reactionary pictures and photographs, used to supply the masses who lacked spiritual food and to anesthetize and deceive them. Such old foreign picture shows had a wide field of activity, in big cities like Tianqiao in Beiping, the City God Temple in Shanghai, and in the market towns of small and medium-sized cities and rural areas, everywhere there were traces of them. It was indeed a very popular way of carrying out enslavement education, and it is very necessary to seize this old fortress and replace it with fresh and lively new content that expresses the lives and revolution of the people!
    Using the performance method of foreign picture shows to contribute newly produced paintings to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers is one of the fine arts activities in the liberated areas in the past five years. Everyone calls it "New Picture Show," and it is indeed welcomed by the broad masses. From 1944, fine arts workers in Yan'an began the activities of new picture shows. After a few fine arts workers realized that new picture shows were a sharp weapon for fine arts work to go to the masses and connect with the masses, they went to the countryside to collect materials at any time, compile stories at any time, create comic strips, write explanations and lyrics, solicit and cooperate with folk artists who tell stories and sing, and help and train them to perform. The new picture show has been from the city to the countryside, from the factory to the army, from this area to that area. From Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, it has developed to various liberated areas such as Jin-Cha-Ji, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, Shandong, and Northeast; the new picture show has played a certain role in mass movements, cultural and educational work, in mobilizing production, democratic construction, land reform, and the War of Liberation. The new picture show has become a convenient tool for the people's cultural entertainment, so it is welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, especially in the past in the vast rural environment, it is welcomed by the peasant masses.
    The production and performance of new picture shows can supplement areas that cannot be popularized by movies and slides. New picture shows can exhibit colored and uncolored paintings and cartoon reproductions in areas lacking exhibition venues (in terms of art publishing, good comic strip drafts can be published in pictorials and printed into booklets to replace "children's books," and the books can also be enlarged and printed into new picture shows). In the sense of mobile exhibition of original paintings, in the sense of exhibiting comic strips, this fine arts activity has its own development prospects. Moreover, its flexibility is very great, from the most basic art conditions to infinitely high art conditions, this activity method can be presented to the masses in rural areas, factories, mines, and troops. It is simply like a small mobile "art gallery," no wonder the common people warmly welcome it, saying: watching a "big picture show" once is more interesting than watching an old-fashioned "big play" once. (The common people welcome new works of realism with ideological content) For example, in 1946 in Yan'an, the Central Party School's Cultural and Labor Office collectively produced the serial oil painting "Zhao Tianshun Overturns," and we personally saw that some of the audience shed tears because they saw the pictures of poor farm laborers being oppressed and exploited by evil landlords. Later, when it was brought to Longdong for performance, according to the news on the Yan'an Liberation Daily at that time: some farmers told everyone that after seeing this set of comic strips, they bravely demanded to join the Farmers' Association and fight against the landlords; when it was performed on the border, the militia automatically stood guard, welcomed and protected the old people from the KMT-controlled areas outside the border to come to the border area to watch.... In addition, workers and soldiers, like farmers, also welcome this fine arts activity method, they especially welcome artistic comic strips and current affairs cartoons. On this year's May Day, the workers of the Shijiazhuang Electric Light Company drew new works reflecting their own production situation and performed them with new picture shows, which were praised by the audience. …
    The new picture shows developed in the liberated areas in the past five years are different in form from the old picture shows. A hole is dug in the middle of a cloth curtain about seven feet high and one foot wide, revealing a picture frame with lace. The picture frame is embedded in a wooden rectangular box. The size of the box should be specified in several standard sizes in the future. This rectangular box is joined with wooden tenons and can be temporarily disassembled and folded into a bundle for easy carrying. Under the box, there are wooden frames or it is placed on two layers of tables. The pictures are drawn on whole or half-size newspapers, and the four sides are pasted on slightly the same size of thick paper, or the inner frame of the picture frame is nailed with cloth. Various pigments can be freely used, and dyes or earth pigments are more suitable; watercolor and oil paints are more expensive and used less. One person inside the curtain changes the pictures. Dozens or twenty or thirty pictures are placed in the box together (the inside of the curtain can accommodate a simple small band accompaniment), and someone outside the curtain makes explanations and sings. Another function of the cloth curtain is to separate the scenery behind the box, so as to attract the audience's attention to the screen. It is also free to配制new lyrics and new songs or use folk tunes for folk artists to compose and sing. The number of pictures exhibited in each show and performance, the time is appropriate to be within two hours. The venue is in a square, school classroom or club, and it is suitable to accommodate dozens to two or three hundred people. The activity method of "New Picture Show" has not yet become popular. It may be tried in places with people's cultural centers, clubs, and schools.
    In addition, it is to transform the content of the old foreign picture shows and use its original set of tools (divided into two types for three to five people and seven to eight people, with box frames, magnifying glasses, picture frames, etc.), abolish the pictures and photos that are harmful to the people, and replace them with new content of painting reproductions or photos (in the glass frame of the old foreign picture show, you can put colored large pictorial selections), help folk artists compile new pictures and oral explanations and lyrics, and eliminate the old low-grade taste. In the past, in the transformation movement of folk art in the Ji-Lu-Yu area, there have been certain achievements. It is harmful to the people if the old foreign picture show is allowed to continue its spontaneous activities. This requires: painting, photography, songs, art publishing workers to cooperate with folk artists to solve it together.
    Using the new picture show, this light and mobile activity method as a tool for cultural entertainment, this is not a "foreign" show, and the content is not a "Western" scene; in fact, it can be renamed "New Picture Show," "New Scenery," or "Big Pictorial," which is more appropriate.

　　开展“新画片”活动

    “洋片”也叫作“西洋景”，过去一向被当作“下流社会”的娱乐。那内容，除了是无聊的风景、人像以外，还有低级趣味的甚至淫秽和反动的图画和照片，用来供给缺乏精神粮食的群众并用它麻醉群众、欺骗群众。那种旧洋片、活动的领域很广泛，在大都市里如北平天桥、上海城隍庙、以及中小城市和农村的集市，到处都有它的足迹。它的确是进行奴化教育的一种很普及的方式，夺取这一旧的堡垒而代之以新鲜活泼的表现人民生活、人民革命的新内容是非常必要的！
    利用洋片的演出方式，把新的绘画制作贡献给工农兵广大群众，这是近五年来解放区美术活动之一种。大家把它叫作“新洋片”，的确是受到广大群众的欢迎。从一九四四年起，延安美术工作者开始了新洋片的活动，少数美术工作者在认识到新洋片是美术工作到群众中去、联系群众的利器以后，下乡随时搜集材料，随时编出故事，制作连环图画，写说明和唱词，征求、和说书卖唱的民间艺人合作，帮助、训练他们演出。新洋片曾是从城市到农村，从工厂到部队，从这一地区到那一地区。从陕甘宁发展到晋察冀、晋冀鲁豫、山东和东北等各个解放区；新洋片是在群动运动中，在文教工作上，在发动生产、民主建设、土地改革和解放战争中，起了一定的作用。新洋片成为人民的文化娱乐的一种轻便的工具，因此，它受到广大工农兵群众的欢迎，特别是在过去广大农村的环境，受到农民群众的欢迎。
    新洋片的制作和演出，可以补充电影、幻灯所不能普及的地区，新洋片可以在缺乏展览会场的地区，展出有色的和无色的绘画、漫画的复制品（在艺术出版方面，好的连环画稿，既可以在画报上发表，又可以印成小册子来代替“小人书”，同时书也可以放大印制成新洋片），在流动展出绘画原作的意义上来说，在展出连环图的意义上来说，这一美术活动方式是具有它本身发展的前途的。并且，它的伸缩性很大，从起码的艺术条件直到无限高度的艺术条件，都可以利用这个活动方式呈现给农村、工厂、矿山和部队的群众。它简直就好象一个小型的流动的“艺术陈列馆”，无怪乎老百姓那样热烈的欢迎，说是：看一次“大画片”比看一次老一套的“大戏”还有意思。（老百姓欢迎有思想性的现实主义的新作品）例如一九四六年在延安，中央党校文工室集体制作的连环油画“赵天顺翻身”的展、演，我们亲眼看见在观众中真有因看到雇贫农受恶霸地主的压迫剥削的图画而流出眼泪的。后来，把它带到陇东演出时，根据当时延安解放日报上的消息：有的农民自己告诉大家说，因为看了这套连环画以后就勇敢的要求参加农会和地主作斗争；在边界上演出时，民兵自动放哨，欢迎并保护边区外边蒋统区的老百姓过边区来看……。另外，工人和战士，也和农民一样欢迎这种美术活动方式的，他们特别欢迎艺术性的连环图画和时事漫画。在今年五一节，石家庄电灯公司的工友们曾绘制、反映自己的生产情况的新作品、用新洋片演出而得到观众的称赞。……
    解放区近五年来所发展的新洋片，其形式和旧有的洋片不同，在一块高七尺宽一丈左右的布幕中间挖孔，露出一面带有花边的画框，画框镶嵌在一个木制的长方形箱子上。箱子的大小尺寸，将来应规定几号标准。这个长方形箱子以木榫接合，可以临时拆卸，叠成一束，以便携运，箱子下边，支有木架或放置在两层棹子上。画片用整张报纸或半张报纸大小作画，四边贴在略同大小的厚纸上，或用画框内框钉布。自由采用各种颜料，以染料或土颜料较为合适；水彩画和油画颜料较贵，用的较少。幕内一人抽换画片，为数十张或二、三十张的画片是一齐放置在箱子里的（幕内可以容下简单的小乐队伴奏），幕外有人作说明、演唱。布幕的另一作用，是用它把箱子后面的景物分开，以便把观众的视线吸引到画面上来。配制新词新曲或利用民间小调由民间艺人自编自唱，也有伸缩自由。每场展演画片数字，其时间以在两小时以内为合适。会场在广场、学校课堂或俱乐部内，以容纳数十人到二三百人之谱为适宜。“新洋片”的活动方式，还没有普及起来，在有人民文化馆、俱乐部和有学校的地方不妨试办。
    另外，是改造旧洋片的内容而利用它原来旧有的一套工具（分三五人看的和七八人看的两种，有箱架、扩大镜、画框等），废除有害人民的画片照片，代之以新内容的绘画复制品或照片（在旧洋片的玻璃框子里，可以装进有色的大画报选页）、帮助民间艺人编制新的画片和口头说明、唱词，淘汰旧有的低级趣味。这在过去冀鲁豫区民间艺术的改造运动上，已有了一定的成绩。如果让旧洋片照旧的自流活动，对人民是有害的。这需要：绘画、摄影、歌曲、艺术出版各方面的工作者与民间艺人合作，共同来解决。
    利用新画片，这个轻便流动的活动方式作为文化娱乐的一种工具，这不是什么“洋”片，内容也不是什么“西洋”景；实际上，可以把它改名叫作“新画片”、“新光景”，或者叫作“大画报”，才比较恰当。
