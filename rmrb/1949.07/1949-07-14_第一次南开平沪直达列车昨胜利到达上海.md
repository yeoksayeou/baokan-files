　　The First North-to-Shanghai Direct Train
  　Successfully Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday
    [This Dispatch from Our Shanghai Office, Thirteenth] The 11th direct train from Beiping to Shanghai, which officially departed from Beiping on the 10th, slowly entered the North Station at 17:14 today (delayed by 24 hours and 20 minutes due to rain and ferry conditions) amid a grand welcoming line of all employees of the Shanghai Railway Bureau. The entire journey was 1,496 kilometers, passing through the famous Yellow River, Huai River, and Yangtze River. It demonstrated the great victory of the Chinese people's construction efforts. As the train entered the North Station, the 550 male and female passengers proudly cheered "Arrived in Shanghai!" for their successful arrival in Shanghai. Huang Yifeng, Director of the Shanghai Railway Administration, shook hands with all the train staff and then delivered a welcoming speech. He said: The first train from Beiping not only shortened the distance between Beiping and Shanghai and facilitated the exchange of materials between the North and the South, but also enabled Shanghai's railway industry to achieve greater development. He announced a valuable gift from the Jinan Railway Administration—the Jiangnan locomotive, saying that it represents the great solidarity of the working class.
