Tangshan Telegram: In the seven months since the liberation of Tangshan, workers in various factories and mines, under the leadership of the city's Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, have made certain achievements in restoring and developing production, and a large number of activists have emerged. The organization of trade unions has been prepared to a certain extent. In order to rapidly establish formal trade union organizations and absorb a large number of members, the City Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee has decided to establish industrial trade union organizations in various factories and mines before the end of July, and pointed out four points of attention to prevent possible closed-doorism or forced membership: 1. Deeply convey the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Li Lisan and the resolutions of the North China Workers' Congress to the workers and staff, and combine them with the actual situation to展开讨论，解决实际问题。 2. Continue to strengthen class education among workers to raise class consciousness, and focus on explaining the mass character of trade unions, to overcome the past closed-doorism tendencies. Prevent sectarianism within the trade union. For those who are temporarily unwilling to join the union, unite with them and pay attention to absorbing them into the union. 3. Explain the democratic centralism in the trade union, and conduct organizational and disciplinary education among the workers. 4. The focus of formally establishing trade unions should start with the establishment of industrial trade unions in major factories and mines, and then establish handicrafts trade unions, shop employee trade unions, transport coolie trade unions, cultural and educational workers' trade unions, and government employee trade unions. Also, pay attention to integrating this with other current tasks. At present, all factories and mines in the city are carrying out propaganda work for establishing trade unions.

    唐山总工会筹委会决定
    月底成立各厂工会
    深入传达少奇、立三同志报告
    【唐山电】唐山解放后七个月来，各厂矿工人在市总工会筹委会领导下，恢复发展生产，获得一定的成绩，也涌现出大批积极分子，工会组织已有了一定的准备。为迅速建立正式工会组织，大量吸收会员，市总工会筹委会顷决定七月底以前建立起各厂矿产业工会的组织，并指出注意事项四点，防止可能发生的关门主义或强迫入会的偏向：一、在职工中深入传达刘少奇、李立三两同志的报告和华北工代会的决议，并结合实际情况，展开讨论，解决实际问题。二、在工人中继续加强阶级教育提高阶级觉悟，并着重讲解工会的群众性，要克服过去的关门主义偏向。工会内部要防止宗派主义偏向，对于暂时不愿入会的，应该团结他们，注意吸收他们入会；三、讲明工会中的民主集中制，在职工中进行组织性纪律性的教育。四、正式成立工会的重点，应从各大厂矿成立产业工会来开始，然后再成立手工业工会、店员工会、运输苦力工会、文教工作者工会以及机关职工会。并注意要与当前其他任务结合起来进行。现全市各厂矿正在进行建立工会的宣传工作。
