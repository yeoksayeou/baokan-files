Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th: The Shanghai Jiefang Daily published a commentary on the 10th regarding the American national William Olive's violation of law and discipline, stating:

　　At the time when our Shanghai military and civilians were holding a grand parade to review their own strength, Olive actually drove his car into the parade, which is clearly a provocative act by the American imperialists. After violating traffic regulations, Olive even treated our public security police with the arrogant attitude of an imperialist. He even wanted to treat our public security police with the attitude that the American vice-consul used to have towards the Kuomintang reactionary government as his "master." But Olive was completely wrong. In Shanghai after liberation, the people are the masters. The People's Government will never tolerate or allow foreign nationals to be arrogant and insulting to our people! Under the rule of the People's Government, any illegal and undisciplined provocative acts by imperialists will be punished accordingly! All imperialist forces of aggression must get out of China! All foreign nationals must strictly abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government!

　　It is absolutely intolerable for an American national to treat our people and the People's Government with the arrogance and barbarity of an imperialist! However, when our Public Security Bureau detained such a law-breaking foreign national, it patiently carried out persuasion and education until Olive himself admitted the error of his serious illegal behavior. And when he bowed his head to our people to repent and beg for forgiveness, expressing his willingness to be a law-abiding foreign national in the future, our Public Security Bureau still gave lenient treatment to such a criminal who should have been severely punished. This is the People's Government's policy towards foreign nationals, that is, those who abide by the law and work peacefully will be protected, those who violate the law and commit crimes will be punished as they deserve, and those who repent and correct their mistakes will be treated with leniency.

　　外侨必须严守人民政府法令
  　上海解放日报评美侨违法事件
    【新华社上海十日电】沪解放日报十日就美侨威廉姆·欧立夫干犯法纪事件发表社评称：
    欧立夫当我上海军民举行检阅自己的力量的盛大游行之时，竟自驾汽车冲入游行队伍，这显然是美帝国主义者的一种挑衅行为。欧立夫在违犯交通规章之后，竟还以帝国主义者蛮横的态度对待我公安局员警。他还想以美国副领事过去对国民党反动政府的“主子”的态度来对待我公安局员警。可是欧立夫是完全错了，解放后的上海是人民做主人了，人民政府决不容忍和允许外侨对我人民蛮横和侮辱！在人民政府的治下，帝国主义者的任何违法干纪的挑衅行为均将受到应有的处罚！一切帝国主义的侵略势力必须从中国滚出去！一切外侨必须严格遵守人民政府的法令！
    一个美国侨民以帝国主义者的骄横野蛮的态度来对待我人民和人民政府，这是绝不能容忍的！但我公安局对这样一个犯法侨民，在加以拘禁处分之时，还是耐性地进行了说服教育，直到欧立夫自己承认其严重犯法行为的错误，而在他向我人民低头悔过求恕，表示今后愿做一个守法侨民时，我公安局对这样一个理应严惩的罪犯还是予以宽大的处理。这就是人民政府对外侨的政策，即对守法安业者必予保护，对违警犯法者必予应得处分，对悔罪改过者则予宽大处理。
