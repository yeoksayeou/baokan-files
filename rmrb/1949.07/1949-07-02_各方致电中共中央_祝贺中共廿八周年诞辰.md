Various Parties Send Telegrams to the CCP Central Committee
　　Congratulating the CCP on its 28th Anniversary

Telegrams of Congratulations from Democratic Parties

　　[Ping City News] On July 1st, the 28th anniversary of the birth of the Communist Party of China, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China National Salvation Association, the Association of Comrades of the Three People's Principles, the Democratic Promotion Association of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the China Zhi Gong Party jointly sent a telegram to the CCP Central Committee to congratulate it. The text of the telegram is as follows:

　　To the Gentlemen of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

　　As the people's revolution approaches national victory, we are extremely excited and joyful to celebrate the 28th anniversary of the birth of your party. It is simply impossible to express our feelings in words.

　　Four hundred and seventy-five million people have broken free from the shackles of thousands of years of feudal autocracy and washed away the humiliation of a hundred years of imperialist bullying. This is an extremely joyful event. The most important factor in the rapid completion of this great event is the arduous struggle of more than three million Communist Party members under the leadership of Chairman Mao. If the Chinese people did not have the Communist Party, they would not know when the dark days would end. The birth of your party is a signal for the emergence of a new China. It is only natural that the Chinese people celebrate the birth of your party.

　　We fully believe that the Chinese people will forever unite under the leadership of your party, and a people's democratic and industrialized China will surely be built successfully. Your party will surely live and prosper together with the Chinese people.

　　Li Jishen, Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
　　Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, China Democratic League
　　Huang Yanpei, China National Democratic Construction Association
　　Ma Xulun, China Association for Promoting Democracy
　　Peng Zemin, Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party
　　Li Zhangda, China National Salvation Association
　　Tan Pingshan, Association of Comrades of the Three People's Principles

Telegram from the Beiping Municipal Branch of the Democratic League

　　[Ping City News] The Beiping Municipal Branch Committee of the China Democratic League sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China yesterday, congratulating the CCP on its 28th anniversary. The original telegram is as follows: To the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and forwarded to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

　　The birth of the Communist Party of China is indeed a great event for the Chinese nation and the Chinese people! Since the birth of your party, the Chinese revolution has embarked on a new historical stage. Without the participation of your party, there would be no Chinese revolution from 1925 to 1927. Unfortunately, the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, betrayed the revolution, aggravated the disasters of the Chinese people, and thus invited the unprecedented aggression of Japanese imperialism against China. Fortunately, your party led the War of Resistance against Japan with the "Ten Major Programs for Resisting Japan and Saving the Country," insisted on the War of Resistance with a full-scale guerrilla war, and finally drove Japanese imperialism out of China. For the past three years, your party has led the People's Liberation War, resolutely and thoroughly implementing the New Democratic Revolution against feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism. It has now achieved a decisive and nationwide victory, freeing the Chinese people from a hundred years of imperialist oppression and thousands of years of feudal oppression. The Chinese nation and the Chinese people have since turned over a new leaf, and Chinese history has begun a new era. Over the past twenty-eight years, your party has been unyielding and persistent, overcoming extremely complex and incomparably difficult, tortuous roads, and finally defeating the counter-revolutionary forces, liberating the Chinese nation and people, and achieving great achievements. We believe that your party will lead the people of the whole country and all revolutionary parties to build an independent, free, democratic, united, prosperous and strong new China in the future, which is absolutely based and guaranteed. Looking back on the glorious history of your party's selfless, dedicated struggle for the nation and the people, and looking forward to the bright future of the People's Republic of China, we are immensely moved and excited! On the occasion of the 28th anniversary of your party, we express our congratulations and shout:

　　Long live the Communist Party of China!
　　Long live the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong!
　　Long live the victory of the Chinese people's liberation!

Telegram from the Literary and Art Congress

　　[Ping City News] The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers of China sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao on July 1 to express their respect. The original telegram stated: To the respected Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, respected Chairman Mao:

　　The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers of China is holding a meeting in liberated Beiping, coinciding with the 28th anniversary of the birth of the Communist Party of China. Looking back on these twenty-eight years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the heroic struggle of the people of the whole country, China has finally been liberated from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and is about to achieve a national victory. All of our representatives would like to pay you the highest tribute! We are determined to fight under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great and wise Chairman Mao to completely eliminate all reactionary remnants and build a new democratic China and its new literature and art!

    四万七千五百万人挣脱数千年封建专制的枷锁，洗刷一百年帝国主义欺凌的耻辱，这是一件痛快无比的大事；而这一大事之快要完成，三百余万共产党员的在毛主席领导下坚苦奋斗，实为其最主要的因素。假使中国人民没有共产党，就不知道黑暗的日子何时始能终了，贵党之诞生，实为新中国出现的信号，中国人民为贵党之诞生而狂欢，正是理所当然。
    我们充分相信，中国人民必然永远地团结在贵党领导之下，人民民主的工业化的中国必然建造成功，而贵党又必然与中国人民同寿同荣。

    【平市讯】中国民主同盟北平市支部委员会昨日致电中共中央委员会，祝贺中共二十八周年诞辰，原电如下：中国共产党北平市委员会并转中国共产党中央委员会：
    中国共产党的诞生，对中国民族和人民，实在是一件天大的事情！自从贵党诞生以后，中国革命就开始走上了新的历史阶段。没有贵党参加，就不会有一九二五年至一九二七年的中国大革命。不幸以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派背叛革命，加重了中国人民的灾难，因而招来了日本帝国主义对中国空前的大侵略。幸赖贵党以“抗日救国十大纲领”领导抗战，以全面游击战争坚持抗战，最后把日本帝国主义赶出中国去。三年以来，贵党领导人民解放战争，坚决彻底实行了反封建主义、反帝国主义与官僚资本主义的新民主主义革命，现在已经获得决定性的与全国性的胜利，使中国人民摆脱百年来的帝国主义的压迫与千年来的封建压迫；而中国民族与中国人民从此大大地翻了身，中国历史从此开始了新的纪元。二十八年来，贵党不屈不挠，再接再厉，经过了极其复杂的与无比的艰难困苦、迂回曲折的道路，终于战胜了反革命势力，解放了中国民族和人民而获得了伟大成就。我们相信贵党今后领导全国人民与各革命党派建设独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的新中国，是绝对有根据有保证的。回顾已往贵党大公无私，献身民族与人民的艰苦卓绝奋斗的光荣历史，展望中华人民民主共和国的光明前途，我们无任感动与兴奋！兹值贵党二十八周年纪念，特申祝贺之意，并高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁！
    中国人民解放胜利万岁！
    文代大会电
    【平市讯】中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会于七月一日向中共中央委员会暨毛主席致电表示敬意，原电称：敬爱的中共中央委员会，敬爱的毛主席：
    中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会在解放了的北平开会，适逢中国共产党二十八年的诞辰，回顾这二十八年来，由于中国共产党的正确领导和全国人民的英勇斗争，中国终于从帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的压迫和剥削下解放出来，即将取得全国的胜利，我们全体代表谨向你们致最高的敬礼！我们坚决在中国共产党和伟大英明的毛主席领导下，为彻底肃清一切反动的残余势力，建设新民主主义的新中国及其新文艺而奋斗！
    中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会
    北平院校教职员联合会筹委会电
    【平市讯】北平院校教职员联合会筹委会昨日（七月一日）致电中共中央，祝贺中共二十八周年诞辰，原电如下：中国共产党北平市委员会并转中国共产党中央委员会均鉴：
    北平解放后我们第一次能够在这文化古都给中国共产党庆祝他的生日，实在值得欢欣鼓舞的！过去二十八年来中国共产党和毛主席领导中国的人民从事反帝国主义、反封建主义、反官僚资本主义的斗争，历尽千辛万苦终究达到解放全民族建设新中国的最后胜利，如果没有中国共产党没有毛主席就没有民主的新中国。现在新政协正在筹开，人民的联合政府不久即可成立，我们文化教育工作者躬逢盛会，愿在中国共产党领导下，在文化阵线上培养更多的人材，为建设民主的新中国共同努力。
