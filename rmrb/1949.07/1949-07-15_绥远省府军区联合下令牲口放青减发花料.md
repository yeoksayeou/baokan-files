　　绥远省府军区联合下令
  　牲口放青减发花料
    ▲绥远各地歉收，为减轻人民负担，解决粮荒草荒困难，绥远省人民政府及军区司令部特于七月四日发布联合命令，将所有骑马、驮骡组织放青减料，规定从七月十五日起到十一月十五日共四个月为放青时期（炮骡从八月一日起放青三个月）。在此期间内，所有无任务的牲口一律停发公草，军队系统的给花料一半，党、政、民系统的发五分之二。
    ▲绥远省人民政府教育厅于六月二十八日召开的各县教育科长联席会议，已于三日闭幕。研究了“华北区小学教育暂行实施办法”和“关于小学教育几个重要问题的指示”；提供了“暑期教师讲习会计划草案”，检讨了领导上方针不明确，管理上的放任自流，学生中的极端民主等缺点，决定贯彻民主集中制精神，防止单纯注意文化，放松政治脱离实际等偏向。
