    Respected Chairman Mao:
    Under the glorious illumination of your great thought, we held the unprecedentedly grand and united National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, extensively exchanged work experiences and opinions, and determined the direction and tasks for our joint efforts in the future. After fourteen days of meetings, the congress successfully concluded today. We would like to solemnly declare to you that we will resolutely follow the direction you have indicated, strive to develop the people's literature and art work, and build the People's Republic of China to the very end. We extend our highest respects to you and wish you eternal health!

    Commander-in-Chief Zhu and to be forwarded to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:
    We, the entire body of delegates to the Literary and Art Congress, extend our warm and lofty respects to you and all the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army under your command!
    Thanks to the heroic and invincible fighting of the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Revolutionary War has basically achieved nationwide victory. It is under this victorious situation that we, the representatives of literary and art workers from across the country, have been able to converge in Beiping and hold this unprecedented grand congress. At this congress, we unanimously support and are willing to actively practice Chairman Mao's policy of literature and art serving the people, first and foremost serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We not only hold infinite admiration for the great heroes and heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army but will also strive to praise and eulogize them in literary and artistic works. We hope to create works worthy of the Chinese People's Liberation War. Literary and artistic work should emulate the military front! We must fight to the end to eliminate the remnants of the enemy and strive for the complete victory of the New Democratic Revolution throughout the country!

          July 19

    The Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference:
    Due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and due to the resolute and heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, the New Democratic Revolution of the Chinese people against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism has achieved basic victory. Chinese history has now fundamentally changed direction. The people of the whole country need solid unity and centralized leadership to thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of counter-revolution, comprehensively engage in the construction of politics, economy, culture, and national defense, and create an independent, free, strong, and happy New China. The preparation of the New Political Consultative Conference completely conforms to the objective requirements of history and the urgent hopes of the people. All of us delegates unanimously express our sincere congratulations and warm support to you, and wish for the early birth of the People's Democratic United Government, and are willing to strive for the construction of a new Chinese cultural enterprise.
