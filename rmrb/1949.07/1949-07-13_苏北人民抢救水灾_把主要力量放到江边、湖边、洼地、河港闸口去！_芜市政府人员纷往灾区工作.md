Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 12th: Continuous torrential rains in the Northern Jiangsu region have caused high water levels in rivers, lakes, and seas. Some low-lying areas have been flooded. Currently, the Party, government, army, and people are making every effort to rescue the situation. The Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office has allocated 45 million RMB as the first batch of flood control funds for various special districts, and instructed each special district to establish prevention organizations from top to bottom. Cadres at all levels of the Party, government, army and people should actively lead the people to repair embankments and prevent floods. In late June, the water level of the 340-li embankment along the Yangtze River in Taizhou Special District was 2.3 feet higher than last year. In Rugao and Taixing, the water level of some embankments had almost risen to the top of the embankments. The Rugao, Taixing, and Jingjiang People's Governments mobilized 300,000 laborers to carry out emergency repairs, and initially completed the work of raising, filling holes, and leveling by the end of last month, and are still continuing to repair them. In low-lying areas of various counties, water accumulated and flooded. In Taipei County (a newly established county in northern East Taipei), 90% of the 230,000 mu of cotton fields were flooded, with water depths reaching one foot. Parts of Dongtai, Haian (a newly established county in eastern Taizhou), Rugao and other counties were submerged, and many rice seedling fields in Yancheng and Haimen counties were also flooded. Local people's governments have urgently mobilized the people to fight against the flood. The Taizhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all its subordinate areas to "put the main force and focus of work on the riverside, lakeside, low-lying areas, river port sluices." Cadres of various organs are currently leading the people in repairing defenses in the rain. In Nantong County, eight breaches occurred in the Jiangdi embankment in two townships in the southern district of the city during the high tide. After the government led the people in emergency rescue day and night, the breaches were blocked and the danger was averted. The county magistrate of Yizheng County personally led the people to block the Xinba of Chengdongmen and repair the Nanmen embankment, so that thousands of acres of autumn fields were spared from the flood. Zhangmei Village in Dongtai County dug two ditches in just two and a half days, drained the accumulated water, and rescued thousands of acres of cotton fields. The Tonghai sluice gate in Taipei County was also fully opened, allowing the accumulated water to quickly enter the sea, and 400 waterwheels have been organized to go to the cotton reclamation area to help drain water.

In addition, in order to prevent river embankments and gate openings from collapsing and prevent floods caused by autumn rains, the Huaiyin Special Office of Northern Jiangsu promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on the Protection of Embankments" on the 4th of this month, strictly prohibiting opening gaps on river embankments or digging pits and holes on the top and slopes of embankments. It is forbidden to graze livestock, build sheds, and plant tall trees on the embankment. The regulations also stipulate that the district, township, and village governments at all levels should pay attention to ensuring that the river embankments within their respective jurisdictions are effectively protected level by level and section by section. For major trunk rivers such as the Grand Canal, Zhangfu River, Former Yellow River, Yancheng River, and Mu River, embankment protection teams should be organized. If there are defects in the river embankment, smaller projects such as badger holes and wolf dens should be promptly supervised by the local village governments to the embankment protection team or mobilize laborers to be responsible for repairs, and larger projects should be reported level by level for repairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 12th: Nanjing News: Many breaches occurred in the river embankment along the Qingyi River in Wuhu, and the urban area was flooded. The local people's government is now fully leading the disaster relief. Recently, there has been continuous rain in the south of the Yangtze River, and the water of the Qingyi River, which runs through Wuhu City, has surged. Due to years of disrepair of the embankment along the river during the Kuomintang era, the sudden arrival of a major flood caused breaches in many dangerous sections. On the 2nd of this month, floods poured into the city. Among the 132 baos in the city, residents in 96 baos suffered from the flood. The accumulated water in the city is four feet deep at the deepest point and one foot at the shallowest point. Staff members of the Wuhu Municipal People's Government went to the disaster areas to help the victims rescue supplies and relocate their residences. Now, porridge sheds and temporary shelters for the victims have been set up in higher terrain to meet emergency needs. During the flood last year, many victims moved to live in trees, and the Kuomintang bandits ignored them. This year, during the flood, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhu not only fully assisted the People's Government in disaster relief, but also gave their houses to the victims, who were deeply moved.

　　苏北人民抢救水灾
  　“把主要力量放到江边、湖边、洼地、河港闸口去！”
    芜市政府人员纷往灾区工作
    【新华社淮阴十二日电】苏北地区连日倾盆大雨，江、湖、河、海水位高涨，若干洼地积水成灾，现党政军民正全力进行抢救中。苏北行政公署日前已拨发人民币四千五百万元，作为各专区首批治水经费，并指令各专区从上到下普遍建立防备组织，各级党政军民干部应积极领导人民修堤防汛。上月下旬，泰州专区沿江三百四十里堤岸，水位较去年高出二·三尺，如皋、泰兴境内部分堤岸水位几已升至堤顶。如皋、泰兴、靖江人民政府先后动员三十万民工进行抢修，于上月底初步完成加高、填穴、补平工作，现仍继续修补中。各县低洼地区，积水浸淫，台北县（东台北部新设县）垦区二十三万亩棉田十分之九被淹，水深及尺。东台、海安（泰州东部新设县）、如皋等县部分地区浸入水中，盐城、海门县亦有不少秧田被淹。各地人民政府已紧急动员人民与水灾斗争。中共泰州地委号召所属各地“把主要力量和工作重点放到江边、湖边、洼地、河港闸口去”。各机关干部刻正冒雨领导人民修防。南通县城南区两个乡江堤于潮汛中决口八处，经政府领导人民日夜紧急抢救后，已堵口脱险。仪征县县长则亲自领导人民堵塞城东门新坝及加修南门堤坝，使数千亩秋田免遭水灾。东台县张梅村仅两天半即挖好两条水沟，排除积水，救出千亩棉田，台北县通海闸口亦已全部开放，使积水迅速入海，并已组织四百部水车至棉垦区帮助排水。
    又苏北淮阴专署为使河堤闸洞免于破塌及防止伏秋水汛泛滥成灾，特于本月四日颁布保护堤防暂行规约，严禁在河堤上开缺口或在堤顶、堤坡挖坑开洞。禁止在堤上放牲口、搭棚盖屋及栽植高树。规约并规定区乡村各级政府应注意各该辖境内之河堤必须按级按段切实负责保护。主要干河如运河、张福河、废黄河、盐河、沐河应组织护堤小组。河堤如有残缺，较小工程如獾洞、狼窝等由各地乡村政府随时督促护堤小组或动员民工负责修理，较大工程应按级呈报修理。
    【新华社北平十二日电】南京消息：芜湖沿青弋江河堤多处决口，市区被淹，现该地人民政府正全力领导救灾。近日江南霪雨，横贯芜湖市的青弋江江水暴涨，沿江河堤因在国民党时代多年失修，大汛突至，险工多处即告决口。本月二日洪水涌进市内，全市一百三十二个保中，有九十六个保的居民遭受水灾。市内积水最深四尺，浅处一尺。芜市人民政府工作人员纷往灾区帮助灾民抢救物资及迁移住所，现已在地势较高处设立施粥厂及灾民临时收容所，以应急需。去年水灾时，灾民多搬住树上，国民党匪帮不闻不问；今年水灾，驻芜湖的解放军不但全力协助人民政府救灾，并且把自己的房子让给灾民住，灾民深受感动。
