    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: Moscow dispatch: The labor of Soviet miners has always enjoyed honor and glory; now, they are further increasing production with the latest technology. Approximately 10,000 miners from Donbas, Kuzbas, the Urals, Karaganda, and other mining areas have been awarded the honorary title of "Meritorious Miner." These workers have a history of selfless labor of ten years or more in coal mining or developing new mines, and they are all production record-breakers who complete their monthly coal production plans. "Meritorious Miner" Peterchenko of Donbas pledged to complete the new Five-Year Plan in four years, and he is now resolutely fulfilling his promise. By utilizing modern technology, he is able to work on two to four mining faces simultaneously and exceed production quotas by three to four times. "Meritorious Miner" Usov of the Kuznetsk Coal Basin completed the Five-Year Plan in two and a half years and trained many young workers. The team of miners led by "Meritorious Miner" Nilkanov of the Karaganda Coal Basin can all skillfully use modern coal mining combines and exceed production quotas step by step. As "Miner's Day" approaches, hundreds more outstanding miners will receive this glorious title.
    The Soviet coal mining industry has been highly mechanized, reaching 99 percent in coal mining operations, 84 percent in transporting coal to the mine shaft, and 96 percent in loading. Moreover, new coal mining machines are constantly being created. For example, the Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry recently summarized the preliminary achievements of the new "Donbas" type coal mining combine and found that this new type of coal mining combine solved the problem of mechanizing the most labor-intensive coal mining process in inclined and steep coal seams on a large scale. The designer of this combine has received the Stalin Prize. The "Donbas" type coal mining combine is extremely efficient. It can automatically and continuously cut coal seams, dig coal blocks, and transport the coal to the transport system. It effectively replaces the most arduous labor. As a result of using this combine, the only work left for the miners is to clean up the mining face after the combine has finished its work. This greatly reduces the number of miners working on the mining face and increases the labor productivity of each worker. Moreover, the use and management of this machine are not complicated, and miners can quickly master it.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: Moscow dispatch: The Soviet government attaches great importance to the welfare of miners. The Soviet Union is now establishing new medical and epidemic prevention institution networks in various coal mining areas. New hospitals have been built in the Donetsk and Karaganda mining areas. Fully equipped general hospitals have also been established in the Artem mining area and the Kuznetsk coalfield. The Soviet Ministry of Public Health has dispatched more than 1,000 additional doctors to medical institutions in coal mining areas. The Soviet government also pays great attention to children's institutions for miners. In the past six months, it has established new kindergartens in various mining centers capable of accommodating 7,000 children, as well as new nurseries and many summer camps for miners' children.

    苏联光荣的“功勋矿工”贡献新技术增加生产
    挖煤运输装车几全部机械化
    【新华社北平十九日电】莫斯科讯：苏联矿工们的劳动，素来都享有荣誉和光荣；现在，他们又以最新的技术，进一步地增加生产。顿巴斯、库兹巴斯、乌拉尔、卡拉干达和其他矿区的矿工，已经约有一万人获得了“功勋矿工”的荣誉称号。这些工人们都有十年或十年以上的采煤或开掘新矿的无我劳动的历史，他们都是创生产纪录的，月月完成煤产量计划的。顿巴斯的“功勋矿工”彼特钦科，保证四年内完成新五年计划，他现在正坚决实现他的保证。由于利用现代化的技术，他能够同时在两个到四个矿面上工作，并且超过生产定额的三倍到四倍。库兹涅茨克煤田的“功勋矿工”乌索夫，两年半就完成了五年计划，并训练出很多青年工人。卡拉干达煤田的“功勋矿工”尼尔卡诺夫所领导的那一班矿工，都已能熟练地使用现代化的采煤联合机，按步就班地超过生产定额。当“矿工节”到来的时候，将又有数以百计的出色的矿工获得光荣的称号。
    苏联采煤业已经高度机械化，其程度在挖煤工作方面已经达到百分之九十九，在把煤运上矿井的工作方面已经达到百分之八十四，装车工作方面也达到了百分之九十六。而且，新的采煤机器，现在正不断创造出来。例如：苏联煤矿工业部最近总结了“顿巴斯”型的新的采煤联合机的初步成绩，发现这种新型的采煤联合机，在广泛的规模上，解决了在倾斜而峻险的煤层中最费劳力的采煤过程机械化的问题。这种联合机的设计人，已经得到了斯大林奖金。“顿巴斯”型采煤联合机的效率极高。它能自动地连续砍煤层、挖煤块、并把煤运送到运输系统去。它实际上代替了最艰苦的劳动。由于使用这种联合机的结果，留给矿工的工作，只是在联合机作完它的工作之后，清理一下矿面罢了。这使得在矿面工作的矿工数目大为减少，并增加了每一工人的劳动生产率。而且，这种机器的使用与管理并不复杂，矿工都能很快地掌握它。
    【新华社北平十九日电】莫斯科讯：苏联政府极其重视矿工的福利事业。苏联各煤矿区域现在正建立新的医药和防疫机构网。顿尼兹和卡拉干达矿区已建设了新的医院。阿尔杰姆矿区和库兹涅茨克煤场，也已设立了设备完美的全科医院。苏联公共卫生部已加派一千多名医生，到煤矿地区的医务机关去。苏联政府对于矿工的儿童机关，也予以很大的注意。近六个月来，它已在各采矿中心区设立了能容纳七千名儿童的新的幼稚园，并设立了新的托儿所和许多矿工儿童夏令营。
