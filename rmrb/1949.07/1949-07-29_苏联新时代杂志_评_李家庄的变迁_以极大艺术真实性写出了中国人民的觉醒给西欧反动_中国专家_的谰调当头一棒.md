The authors said, "This young writer has correctly depicted the development of the Chinese people's political, economic, and cultural life over the past fifteen years in artistic images. The significance of this novel lies not only in its exposure of the reactionary essence of Kuomintang rule and its pointing out of the great creative activities of the Chinese Communist Party, but also in its depiction, with great artistic authenticity, of the awakening of the Chinese people and the growth of their political activities. This novel embodies the complex process of the formation of the spiritual form of democratic Chinese people."

They pointed out that this novel is a head-on blow to the absurdities of those reactionary Western "China experts" who claim "the traditional conservatism of the Chinese people," "their rejection of new things," and "China's stagnation."

In conclusion, the authors said, "'Changes in Li Village' is a historical mold of the great changes in China over the past fifteen years in an artistic form, expressing the people's masses and their selfless struggle on the agenda, and its strength and moving point lie here."

  　评“李家庄的变迁”
    以极大艺术真实性写出了中国人民的觉醒给西欧反动“中国专家”的谰调当头一棒
    【新华社布拉格二十八日电】七月二十日出版的苏联新时代杂志登载斯维特洛夫与乌克兰切夫论赵树理作“李家庄的变迁”的书评，题目是“关于中国农村的小说”。
    作者说“这位年青的作家在艺术的形象里正确地写出了最近十五年来中国人民政治经济和文化生活的发展。这部小说的意义不仅在于它暴露了国民党统治的反动实质和指出中国共产党的伟大创造活动，而且还在于它以极大的艺术真实性写出了中国人民觉醒及其政治活动的增长。这部小说体现了民主中国人的精神形态形成的复杂过程。”
    在这篇论文里作者介绍了“李家庄的变迁”的故事、内容和王铁锁、小常等人物，以及从中所反映出来的解放区人民与军队和政府的亲切关系等，指出对于西欧那些反动的“中国专家”们所谓“中国人民的传统的保守主义”、“对新事物的排拒性”以及“中国的沉滞不前”等谰调，这部小说是迎头的一棒。
    在结语中，作者说，“李家庄的变迁”“是以艺术的形式，模造了近十五年来中国巨大变化的历史，表现了人民群众和他们忘我奋斗的日程，它的力量和动人之处就在这里”。
