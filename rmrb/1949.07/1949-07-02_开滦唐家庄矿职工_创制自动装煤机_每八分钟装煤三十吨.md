Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Mine Workers
　　Create Automatic Coal Loading Machine
　　Loads Thirty Tons of Coal Every Eight Minutes

　　[Tangshan News] Workers at the Tangjiazhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine have successfully researched and manufactured an automatic coal loading machine, which can load 30 tons of coal every eight minutes. Wang Huibin, a technician at the Tangjiazhuang Mine, began researching and manufacturing the coal loading machine in April of last year. From March of this year, with the full cooperation of workers such as Wang Xiduo and foreman Wang Lanhang from the Second Mechanical and Electrical Factory, the machine was successfully manufactured. The entire machine consists of three parts: a tractor, a belt, and an electric roller. The tractor section has 15 horsepower and can make the coal loading advance automatically; the electric roller has 25 horsepower and shovels the coal from the ground and rolls it onto the belt; the belt has 15 horsepower, inclines upwards, and then drops the coal into the railcar. Except for the belt and electric roller, all other parts of the machine can currently be manufactured domestically. The coal loading efficiency of this machine is 30 tons every eight minutes; whereas with manual labor, each person can load at most ten tons per day. This greatly increases the speed of coal loading and saves a lot of time and manpower.

　　The lower part of the machine is currently made of iron wheels and requires the repair of railway tracks. If it is changed to rubber wheels, the trouble of repairing the tracks can be avoided. In addition, if the chain on the electric roller can be changed to a fork, coal lumps can also be loaded onto the car.

　　开滦唐家庄矿职工
  　创制自动装煤机
  　每八分钟装煤三十吨
    【唐山讯】开滦煤矿唐家庄矿职工，研究自制装煤机成功，每八分钟能装煤三十吨。唐家庄矿技师王会宾，从去年四月起即开始研究制造装煤机，今年三月起，又经机电二厂工人王锡铎、领班王兰航等职工的通力合作，始制造成功。全部机器由拖拉、皮带和电滚三部构成：拖拉部是十五匹马力，能使装煤自动前进；电滚为二十五匹马力，将煤从地上铲起滚到皮带上；皮带为十五匹马力，倾斜上转，遂将煤落在车皮里。全部机器除皮带、电滚外，其余各部目前国内均可自制。该机装煤效率，每八分钟可装三十吨；而如用人工，每天每人至多能装十吨。使装煤速度大增，节省大量时间人力。
    该机下部现为铁轮，需修铁轨，如改为胶皮轮，则可免除修轨道的麻烦；此外若能将电滚上的链子改为叉子，煤块也能装上车子。
