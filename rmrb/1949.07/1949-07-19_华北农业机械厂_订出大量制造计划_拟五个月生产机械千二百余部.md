    To Produce Over 1,200 Machines in Five Months

[This newspaper reported] The North China Agricultural Machinery Factory's operations are gradually expanding. Since the Beijing Industrial Exhibition, the factory has successively received orders from the Rehe Industrial Bureau, the North China People's Government's Department of Agriculture, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and the state-owned Shuangqiao Farm, for more than ten types of equipment, including Liberation-style weeding hoes, seeders, and tractor plows. All of these orders will be delivered by mid-August. Based on the development of its business, the factory has now formulated a five-month production and construction plan (from August to the end of the year). Among them, the agricultural machinery manufacturing section accounts for 70% of the entire plan. This includes eleven types of equipment, such as Liberation-style weeding hoes, water pumps, and seeders, totaling 1,255 units.
