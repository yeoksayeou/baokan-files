Launching Afforestation During the Rainy Season

    The period of heavy summer rains is approaching, making it ideal for afforestation in various regions. In North China, due to climatic and natural conditions, future large-scale afforestation, particularly in sandy and barren mountain areas, will greatly benefit from utilizing the rainy season due to the scarcity of rainfall in spring and autumn and the abundance of rainfall during the summer. Currently, most areas lack the habit of afforestation during the rainy season, leading to skepticism about its effectiveness. Investigations show that, except for the cold regions of Yanbei where experiments are still underway, most parts of North China are generally suitable for afforestation during the rainy season. Afforestation is a crucial technical undertaking, and in addition to political mobilization, various regions should master the necessary techniques. The technical articles on afforestation during the rainy season on page four of today's newspaper largely consist of practical experience from the past two to three years, which can be used as a reference for various regions. Some areas, while believing in afforestation during the rainy season, do not understand its characteristics and methods, and plan to plant larger branches and poles along roads during the rainy season. Such blind actions are bound to fail. The North China People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture's instructions on afforestation during the rainy season specifically point out the technical issues such as tree species and seedling age suitable for various forest lands, which is very appropriate. It is hoped that various regions will pay attention to this, and summarize experience in practical work to improve afforestation techniques during the rainy season.
    The issue of forest protection has been repeatedly raised in the past, but according to investigations, destruction still occurs from time to time in various regions. This is a loss of national and people's wealth, and it greatly affects the masses' enthusiasm for afforestation. Afforestation and forest protection are two sides of the same coin. It is hoped that various regions will pay attention to promoting the experience from the spring afforestation movement, solve problems in a timely manner, implement the policy of developing production and protecting production, and strictly stop destruction.

　　发动雨季造林
    伏雨期在即，各地正宜雨季造林。华北由于气象等自然条件，将来大规模造林，特别是在砂荒山荒地区，由于春秋雨量少，伏天雨量多，利用雨季造林有其重要意义。目前大部地区，由于没有雨季造林习惯，因而对雨季造林抱怀疑态度。据调查，除雁北寒冷地带尚在试验研究中外，华北各地一般都适于雨季造林。造林是一个很重要的技术工作，各地除政治动员外，尤应掌握技术。今日本报四版的雨季造林技术稿件，内容多是近二三年来的实际经验，可供各地参考。也有些地区虽也相信雨季造林，但不明雨季造林的特点及方法，而计划在雨季于公路两傍插植较大枝杆，这种盲目行动，必然会遭受失败。华北人民政府农业部雨季造林指示中，具体指出了适用于各种林地的树种、苗龄等技术问题，是很确当的，望各地注意，并在实际工作中总结经验以提高雨季造林技术。
    护林问题，过去虽曾一再提出，但据调查，各地仍时有破坏情况发生，这是国家人民财富的损失，也极大的影响着群众的造林情绪。造林与护林这是同一问题的两面，望各地注意发扬春季造林运动中的经验，及时解决问题，贯彻发展生产与保护生产的政策，严格制止破坏。
