　　Taiyuan Women Workers Enthusiastically Produce
    All Factories Should Pay Attention to Developing Women Workers' Welfare Undertakings
    [Taiyuan Electricity] After the liberation of Taiyuan, the women workers in various state-owned factories quickly resumed work. According to statistics at the end of May, there were 1,400 female workers. By June 28th, this number had increased to 1,747. The women workers in various state-owned factories are now, like the male workers, actively increasing production and reducing costs. In the Jin Sheng Textile Factory's roving section, the average worker produces 0.5 to 0.6 hanks (each hank is 840 yards) of yarn per hour on the first roving frame, while female worker Yan Xiuzhen created a record of 0.711 hanks of yarn per hour. In the Northwest Match Factory's boxing and pasting departments, the women workers are able to arrive at work accurately and on time, even going before dawn. In the Northwest Woolen Mill's spinning department, three female workers operate one machine, working nine hours a day and producing 60 kilograms of woolen yarn, which is two hours less work than under the Yan bandit rule, but 30 kilograms more woolen yarn. In terms of reducing costs, according to statistics from the Northwest Woolen Mill, before liberation, 50 percent of usable wool could be extracted from good wool, but now 70 percent of usable wool can be extracted from secondary wool. Factories have begun to pay attention to women workers' welfare. Nursing rooms have been established in the Jin Sheng Textile Factory, Taiyuan Tobacco Company, and Northwest Woolen Mill, and women's bathhouses and barbershops have also been established in other factories. However, individual factories still do not pay enough attention, which should be noted.
    [Taiyuan Electricity] Various factories in Taiyuan are actively developing women workers' welfare and strengthening women workers' learning. Trade union cadres are actively promoting this work in various factories. The Jin Sheng Textile Factory established a nursery on the 21st and hired two nannies, with expenses paid from the welfare fund. The Jinhua Cigarette Factory also established a nursing room. Women workers of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau held a forum on the 18th, focusing on the issues of learning and transformation.

　　太原女工热情生产
    各厂注意兴办女工福利事业
    【太原电】太原解放后，各国营工厂的女工们，即很快复工。五月底统计，共有女工一千四百人，至六月二十八日增至一千七百四十七人。各国营工厂中的女工，现正和男工一样积极地提高产量，减低成本。晋生纺织厂绒纱间头道纱车，一般工人每小时产纱零点五亨司（每亨司八百四十码）到零点六亨司，而女工阎秀珍却创造了每小时产纱零点七一一亨司的最高纪录。西北火柴厂装盒部和糊盒部的女工们，都能准确按时上班，甚至天不明就去了。西北毛织厂纺织部三个女工看一台车，每日做工九小时，出毛纱六十公斤，比阎匪统治时期，每日少做工两小时，但毛纱可多产三十余公斤。在减低成本方面，据西北毛织厂的统计，解放前，好毛中可提取堪用毛百分之五十，现在次毛中即可提取堪用毛百分之七十。各工厂已开始注意女工福利，晋生纺织厂、太原烟草公司、西北毛织厂都建立了喂奶室，其他工厂也建立了女澡塘、理发室等。但仍有个别厂尚重视不够，亟应引起注意。
    【太原电】　太原市各工厂积极兴办女工福利，加强女工学习。工会干部在各工厂积极推动这一工作。晋生纺织厂二十一日成立了托儿所，并雇褓姆两人，经费由福利金内开支；晋华卷烟厂亦建立了喂奶室。太原铁路局妇女职工在十八日举行座谈会，着重讨论了学习和改造问题。
