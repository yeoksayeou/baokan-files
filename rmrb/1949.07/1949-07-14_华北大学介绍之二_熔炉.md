An Introduction to North China University, Part Two: The Crucible
    Jin Feng

　　More than 20,000 people applied to North China University in Beiping after liberation, and about 13,000 were admitted.

　　These students came from different regions, classes, and strata. Some were college and middle school students, some were teachers from these schools, others were shop assistants, workers, merchants, officers, and technicians. They all poured into North China University with the surge of the revolutionary tide. Objectively, they took a step closer to the revolution, but their level of awareness was somewhat different from those who had crossed the Kuomintang blockade lines to reach the old liberated areas in the past. Of course, many people came to learn revolutionary knowledge in order to actively transform themselves, but most had very different motivations for entering the school: students and generally unemployed youth mostly came to attend university; public employees, merchants, and the unemployed came to North China University to "gild" themselves, hoping to solve their current food and future livelihood problems; some even had a history of reactionary activities and came to wash away their stains; some came just to pursue their lovers, and others came to understand the Communist Party, while a few even had reactionary missions to sabotage North China University. Obviously, these students came to the revolutionary university more for their own way out, and fewer came to study with the conscious intention of serving the people in the future.

　　This motley crew began to exhibit a variety of behaviors after entering the school: some male students still had greasy hair, some female students had big, messy hair and bright red lips, and wore masks all day long, refusing to take them off even during small group meetings, fearing that the dirt of others would contaminate them; students didn't get up in the morning, and even after lights out they played the erhu, sang, and chatted; after the assembly whistle blew for a long time, they slowly walked over one by one. During study, some people did other things, and some simply lay in bed and slept; some people bought a lot of melon seeds and peanuts when holding small group study meetings, as if they were having a tea party. Some people couldn't get used to eating cornbread and millet porridge, and their families sent food every two or three days, and they even brought a lot of oil, soy sauce, and vinegar to make side dishes in school. On Saturdays, no one could calm down, and after dinner they gradually slipped away without asking for leave, almost four-fifths of them leaving.

　　In order to sweep away this lax habit, the leaders of North China University gave reports separately. President Wu talked about the international and domestic situation and the tasks of the youth, so that students could recognize the times; Vice President Fan talked about the way out for intellectuals, so that students could recognize themselves; Vice President Cheng introduced North China University, so that students could understand the learning environment and the nature of learning in a revolutionary university. At this time, some students also felt that they couldn't go on like this and demanded stricter discipline. Deputy Director Chen Weishi of the First Department gave a special report on "Ideological Revolution and Rectification of Work Style," calling on everyone to launch a work style rectification competition to clear obstacles to learning. The students elected representatives and organized an evaluation committee for the competition, so the competition was launched vigorously. One morning, before the wake-up bell rang, an older woman in her forties was bending over to sweep the playground. Students sacrificed their nap time and rest time after meals to clean the dining hall, dig air-raid shelters, carry coal, and clear garbage dumps. Some comrades got up early to clean the toilets, and a female student went alone to clean the pigsty. Before, the things in each group were messy and cluttered in a room, but now they were all neatly and cleanly arranged. At the sound of the whistle, everyone gathered in a minute or two, and as soon as the lights-out bell rang, all the lights were quickly turned off. When attending large classes, two or three thousand people were together, and only the speaker's voice in the loudspeaker and the sound of pen tips scratching on paper could be heard quietly. They also rushed to speak during small group discussions and asked to extend the discussion time. Learning order began to be established.

　　The teaching process of North China University is the process of intellectual transformation, the process of ideological struggle for intellectuals.

　　In the past, under the reactionary education of the Kuomintang reactionaries, who consistently concealed, deceived, oppressed, and distorted the truth, the minds of young intellectuals were like a dark room, filled with feudal, comprador, and anti-people ideological poisons, forming so-called supra-class muddled concepts and narrow-minded nationalism.... Coupled with the influence of feudal bourgeois life, the burden accumulated on them became heavier, and they carried strong individual heroism, individualism, and liberalism, with the viewpoint of belittling labor, belittling workers and peasants, and the style of being arrogant, undisciplined, and unorganized.

　　In response to the ideological characteristics of general intellectuals, North China University adopted the approach of drawing a clear line between political camps and ideological boundaries. Therefore, their courses mainly taught the history of social development (with emphasis on labor creating everything and class struggle), dialectical materialism and historical materialism, the theory of new democracy and various policies, the history of the Chinese revolution, the Chinese Communist Party and the New Democratic Youth League, so that they could understand the general laws of the development of human society, clarify the basic viewpoints of historical materialism, and initially establish a correct stand. Furthermore, they came to recognize the Chinese revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, and then understand various specific policies, from far to near, from abstract to concrete, gradually revealing the treasure trove of social science thought, so that their minds were enlightened. Finally, they connected to themselves, accepted criticism in front of the masses, opened their burdens, exposed the errors and dregs of their thoughts or actions, and used the correct viewpoints and positions to criticize and deny themselves, seeking a new life.

　　In addition to regular classes, visits to factories, troops, and rural areas were organized in a planned way to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers. For example, the students of North China University who studied in Zhengding will never forget their second school, Sanqiu Village. The tunnels of Sanqiu Village illustrated the arduousness and heroism of the Eighth Route Army in resisting Japan, and the narratives of the old village head and militiamen of Sanqiu Village illustrated how the Chinese Communist Party mobilized the people to persist in the War of Resistance and win victory. Sanqiu Village is a living book, which corroborates the two courses of the History of the Chinese Revolution and the Introduction to the CCP, and deepens the students' understanding of the Chinese revolution and the Chinese Communist Party.

　　Through the ideological education of North China University, the students began to establish class viewpoints and labor viewpoints. They began to respect students from worker backgrounds and respect cooks. Some female students, seeing that the cooks were too busy, asked to wash their clothes for them. At the same time, because they saw with their own eyes that the cadres in the school, from the 70-year-old President Wu Yuzhang to the teenage messengers, were so hardworking, simple, and wholeheartedly for the students, they were greatly moved. They thought that this was the embodiment of the Communist Party, so they began to approach the Communist Party, accept education, and accelerate their learning.

　　Following the life and learning competition, the students used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and boldly exposed, excavated, and criticized their shortcomings and errors with the initially established labor, materialist, organizational, mass, and class viewpoints, thereby educating others and themselves. Many people revealed that they had participated in the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, and special agent organizations in the past. Many people cried bitterly during self-criticism. A student who had been a special agent said painfully: "I was originally a pure child. When I was born, my mother didn't tell me to do bad things, but later I did. Who harmed me? It was the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek. It was they who deceived me, framed me, and told me to do bad things. I must take revenge." Only then did they understand that the Communist Party truly loved and nurtured young people, so they developed deep feelings for the CCP and the people's leader Mao Zedong. In addition, they strengthened their determination to make revolution and overcame many personal plans and family concerns. Some students' wives asked them what to do after graduation, and they said: "You go to work in a factory. In the future, those who do not work shall not eat. As for myself, I have my own opinion and will always follow the Communist Party." Many people used to worry about whether their future work would meet their wishes or whether they would be too far from home, but now they all say that they will do whatever they are assigned to do and go wherever they are assigned to go. At the same time, their class stand also began to gradually become clear. For example, many students in the past, under the rule and deception of the Kuomintang, had a vague understanding of what kind of country the Soviet Union was and echoed others' opinions. Now, after learning, they clearly recognized that the Soviet Union was a bulwark of world peace and democracy and the best friend of the Chinese people. Their views on land reform have also changed, and they all believe that feudal exploitation should be eliminated. A student from a landlord family hid jewelry at home, and he wrote back and told them to hand it over to the peasant association immediately.

　　North China University is a big crucible. Here, in two months, tens of thousands of students gradually destroyed the old thoughts, viewpoints, and habits of the past many years, and began to be forged into revolutionary fighters.

　　华北大学介绍之二——熔炉
    金凤
    华大在解放后的北平招生，报名的在两万以上，入学的约一万三千。
    这些来自不同区域不同阶级和阶层的学员，有的是大中学生，有的是大中学的教师，有的是店员、工人、商贩，还有军官和技师。他们都随着革命潮流的高涨，涌进了华大，客观上他们是向革命靠拢了一步，但他们比过去那些通过蒋匪封锁线跑到老解放区的，在觉悟程度上是有些不同的。当然许多人是为了要学习革命知识，以便积极改造自己，但大多数人有着各种极不同的入学动机：学生及一般失学青年多半是为了上大学而来；公教人员、商贩和失业者则是为解决目前的吃饭问题，将来的出路问题，来华大“镀金”；有的甚至是过去作过反动活动，为了洗刷污点而来；有的只是为追爱人，还有的是为了要了解一下共产党，甚至还有少数人竟负有反动使命，来华大阴谋破坏的。显然，这批同学来到革命的大学，为了自己的出路的较多，有意识地将来为人民服务而来学习的较少。
    这样的一支杂色的队伍，入校以后，开始是表现得形形色色：有的男同学头上还油光光的，有的女同学头上蓬松一大堆，口唇血红，整天带上口罩，连开小组会也不肯除下来，深怕别人的肮脏沾染着她；同学们早上不起床，打过熄灯钟还拉胡琴，唱歌，聊天；集合的哨子吹过半天，才慢吞吞的一个个的走来。学习时一些人干别的事，一些人干脆躺在床上睡将起来；一些人开小组学习会时买了瓜子花生一大堆，象是开茶话会一样。有些人吃不惯窝窝头、小米饭，家里三日两头的送菜来，还搬了油瓶酱醋一大堆，在学校里做起小菜。一到星期六，谁也沉不下心去了，吃完晚饭后陆续的溜，也不请假，几乎走掉五分之四。
    为扫清这种散漫习气，华大的领导同志分别来做报告，吴校长谈国际国内的形势和青年的任务，让学生认清时代；范副校长谈知识分子的出路，让学生认清自己；成副校长介绍华大，让学生明了革命的大学的学习环境和学习性质。这时，有些同学也感觉到这样混下去不得劲，要求生活纪律严格一些。一部副主任陈维实同志又专门作了一次“关于思想革命及整顿作风”的报告，号召大家来一个整顿作风竞赛运动，扫清学习上的障碍。学生们选举了代表，组织了竞赛运动的评议委员会，这样竞赛运动火红的搞了起来。一天早晨，还没打起床钟，一位四十多岁的老大姐就在弯腰扫操场。同学们都牺牲午睡及饭后休息的时间，打扫饭场，挖防空壕，抬煤，清除垃圾堆。有的同志一早起来就扫厕所，有一位女同学一个人去打扫猪圈。以前各小组的东西乱七八糟的摆了一屋子，现在都收拾得整整齐齐，干干净净。一吹哨，一两分钟大家就集合好了，熄灯钟一打，所有的电灯很快就熄了，上大课时两三千人在一起，静悄悄的只听见扩音器里演讲者的声音和钢笔尖在纸上飕飕笔记的声音。开小组讨论会时也都抢着发言了，还要求把讨论的时间延长。学习秩序开始建立起来了。
    华大的教学过程，就是知识分子改造的过程，知识分子进行思想斗争的过程。
    过去，在国民党反动派一贯蒙蔽、欺骗、高压、歪曲真理的反动教育下，青年知识分子的头脑好象一间黑暗的屋子，乱七八糟地被塞满了封建、买办、反人民的思想毒素，形成所谓超阶级的糊涂观念、狭隘的民族主义思想…。加上封建的资产阶级的生活影响，使得积压在他们身上的包袱更形沉重，他们带着浓厚的个人英雄主义、个人主义、自由主义的思想意识，带着轻视劳动、轻视工农群众的观点，和自高自大、无组织无纪律的作风。
    针对一般知识份子的思想特点，华大采取的是划清政治营垒与思想界线。因而他们的课程，主要讲授社会发展史（侧重讲劳动创造一切和阶级斗争），辩证唯物论与历史唯物论，新民主主义论及各种政策，中国革命史，中国共产党与新民主主义青年团，使他们从认识人类社会发展的一般规律，明确了历史唯物主义的基本观点，初步建立了正确的立场。再进一步认识到中国的革命与中国共产党，然后了解各项具体政策，由远而近，由抽象到具体，逐渐揭示了社会科学思想的宝库，使他们的头脑豁然开朗，最后联系到自己，在群众面前接受批评，打开包袱，暴露自己思想或行动的错误和渣滓，应用正确的观点、立场加以批判，否定自己，求得新生。
    除正课外，并有计划地组织参观工厂部队农村，向工农兵学习。如在正定学习的华大同学，都不会忘记他们的第二学校三邱村的。三邱村的地道说明了八路军抗日的艰苦英勇，三邱村的老村长和民兵的叙述说明了中国共产党如何发动了人民坚持抗战，赢得胜利。三邱村是一本活的书，印证了中国革命史和中共介绍两课，加深了同学对于中国革命与中国共产党的认识。
    经过华大的思想教育，使同学们开始建立了阶级观点和劳动观点，他们开始尊敬工人出身的同学，尊敬炊事员，有的女同学看炊事员太忙，要求给他补洗衣服。同时由于他们亲眼见到学校里的干部，从七十几岁的吴玉章校长，到十几岁的小通讯员，那样艰苦、朴实、全心全意为着同学，使他们大大地感动了，他们想着这就是共产党的化身，因此他们开始要靠拢共产党，接受教育，加快的学习。
    紧随着生活学习竞赛以后，同学们运用批评和自我批评的武器，以初步建立的劳动、唯物、组织、群众、阶级观点，大胆暴露挖掘批判了自己的缺点与错误，以此教育了别人，也教育了自己。许多人说出了过去参加过国民党、三青团和特务组织，很多人在检讨时痛哭流涕，一个曾做过特务的同学痛心地说：“我本来是个纯洁的孩子，生下来我妈妈并没有叫我做坏事情，可是后来我竟做了，是谁害了我呢？是国民党和蒋介石，是他们欺骗了我，陷害了我，叫我做的坏事，我一定要报仇。”才明白共产党是真正爱护和培养青年的，因此对于中共和人民领袖毛泽东产生了深厚的感情。此外他们又加强了对革命的决心，克服了许多个人打算，家庭顾虑，有的同学老婆问他毕业后怎么办，他说：“你到工厂作工去，将来不劳动者不得食，我自己呢，我有我的主张，永远跟着共产党走。”许多人过去顾虑将来工作是否符合自己的志愿，是否会离家太远，现在都表示分配做什么就做什么，分配到那里就到那里。同时他们的阶级立场也开始逐渐明确了，如有很多学生过去在国民党统治、欺骗下，对苏联是个什么国家认识模糊、人云亦云，现在经过学习后，才清楚地认识了苏联是世界和平民主的堡垒，是中国人民最好的朋友。对于土地改革的看法也有了改变，都认为封建剥削应该铲除。一个地主家庭出身的同学家里藏着首饰，他写信回去叫立刻交给农会。
    华大是一个大熔炉，在这里，两个月的时间，上万的学生逐步消毁着过去多年来的旧的思想、观点和习惯，开始锻炼成了革命的战士。
