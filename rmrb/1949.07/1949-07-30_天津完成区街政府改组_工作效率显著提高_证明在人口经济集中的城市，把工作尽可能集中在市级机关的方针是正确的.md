　　Tianjin Completes Reorganization of District and Street Governments
  　Work Efficiency Significantly Improved
    Proves that Concentrating Work as Much as Possible in Municipal Organs is Correct in Cities with Concentrated Population and Economy
    [Reported by our Tianjin correspondent] The reorganization of district and street governments in Tianjin has been underway since mid-June and all reorganization and handover of specific tasks have been completed. The district governments have been reduced in size to district offices, which are direct agencies dispatched by the municipal government. They handle matters authorized by the municipal government, as well as "orders" and "instructions," and tasks that municipal organs cannot yet take over, such as preferential treatment, relief, and mediation. Each district office has a district chief, a secretary, five assistants or cadres, and one communication officer (the number can be increased by one or two depending on whether the economy is concentrated or dispersed, or whether the social situation is complex. For example, suburban districts still have to deal with land issues, assess and collect agricultural taxes, and lead agricultural and sideline production, so two more people can be added); the cadres of the original district economic section have been handed over to the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters, which have established branches of the Industry and Commerce Bureau and stationed cooperative members in each district, directly under the leadership of the aforementioned two municipal organs; the household registration section has been merged into the public security sub-bureau; the street offices have been merged into the public security police stations; the culture and education section has been taken over by the Education Bureau, and in the future, the leadership of primary education (through central primary schools) and social education (through people's cultural centers) throughout the city will be directly responsible by the Education Bureau. Other items such as various forms and furniture have also been delivered to the relevant departments as designated.

    Over the past month, it has proven that the policy of concentrating work as much as possible in municipal organs to suit the characteristics of concentrated urban population and economy is correct. For example, in the past, the district economic section was under multiple leaderships. The Industry and Commerce Bureau required it to grasp the industrial and commercial situation of the entire district and manage the market; the cooperatives needed its help in organizing cooperatives; the bank entrusted it with small loans; and the trade company and the tax bureau also required assistance in many aspects. With few people and many tasks, coupled with a lack of familiarity with economic work, the work was chaotic and inefficient. Policy grasp was also inevitably biased. For example, in the Seventh District, there were about 4,700 industrial and commercial households subject to taxation, but the district economic section only knew about 2,000 households; the price fluctuations and the reasons for them were not reported to the Industry and Commerce Bureau or other relevant departments in time for appropriate handling. These problems have been preliminarily grasped since the establishment of the Industry and Commerce Branch Bureau, and preliminary division of labor has been implemented according to the work ability of the cadres (such as market management, investigation of seated merchants, and investigation of factories and workshops). Problems that the branch bureau cannot handle can be immediately reported to the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau for instructions by telephone or letter, which shows that we are now more systematic, flexible, and mobile in handling economic work. After the original street offices were merged into the police stations, the quality has been greatly enhanced. It has become the grassroots organization of the municipal government, and from the perspective of contacting the masses and implementing policies, it has initially established a new working foundation among the citizens. At the end of last month, a rotation system of guarding, standing watch, and patrolling was implemented, with each policeman responsible for the household survey of one hundred households. This has provided considerable security for public order, such as a significant increase in the number of reported households, and it has been possible to gain a lot of social information, which has been of great help to the relevant municipal organs in dealing with problems. For example, the district office currently relies on the household registration information mastered by the police station to handle people's identity certificates, job introductions, and distribution of relief supplies to poor children. However, it is undeniable that the police station currently has some factionalism and disunity due to the initial merger; and because the general police officers' policies and cultural level are indeed too low, it is difficult to handle and carry out the work well, which can be gradually overcome in the future under the policy of "police and administration integration."

    After the district government was changed to a district office, the district chiefs generally felt the pain of not having a lower-level organization. Although the organization has been reduced in size, many specific tasks have not been shed, resulting in a passive and chaotic state of work. There are two reasons for this: the municipal organs did not make full preparations for receiving work in terms of ideology and organization before and even today after the reorganization. For example, the preferential treatment section of the Civil Affairs Bureau only added one person after the reorganization of the district and street governments, and all preferential treatment and relief work still had to be borne by the district office, and the requests for instructions from the district office often did not receive a reply; also, the Municipal Labor Bureau has just been established, and there is a backlog of many labor dispute cases, so the district office has to explain the situation and postpone the resolution. Secondly, the working methods of the district office are worth studying. It is understood that the busiest work of the district office is mediation work (mostly marriage, rent, and debt), followed by preferential treatment and relief work, and some temporary emergency tasks such as the current flood control work. The Seventh District had as many as fourteen mediation cases in one day, and generally there are two or three. This is an extremely complex task, and it is difficult to rely on the few cadres in the district office to mediate and deal with other matters. According to the mediation experience of the Sixth District, marriage and debt cases can generally be resolved by entrusting people trusted by both parties to mediate (but the mediation process should be reported to the district office afterwards), because the mediators have no conflicts with both parties and are willing to assist the parties to reconcile. In addition to the Civil Affairs Bureau expanding its organizational structure and improving work procedures to reduce the burden on the district, the district office should seek improvements in working methods at present in preferential treatment and relief work. For example, preferential treatment grain can be issued every three months or half a year, which can not only reduce their own workload, but also make the grain funds as production funds for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, so that they will not eat a little and spend a little. And try to cultivate activists or use the past various committees to assist the work, but should prevent them from abusing power over the masses.

　　天津完成区街政府改组
  　工作效率显著提高 
    证明在人口经济集中的城市，把工作尽可能集中在市级机关的方针是正确的
    【本报天津讯】天津市区街政府自上月中旬改组迄今已逾一月，各项改组和交代具体工作均已完成。区政府缩小编制为区公所，是市府直接派出机关，办理市府授权及“令”、“示”事项与目前市级机关尚无法接收的工作如优抚、救济、调解等。区公所设区长秘书各一人、助理员或干部五人、通讯员一人（按经济集中与分散或社会情况复杂与否，可增添一两人。如市郊区目前尚得处理土地问题、评定与征收农业税款、领导农副业生产故可增加两人）；原区政府下属经济股干部交由工商局和市合作总社在各区成立了工商分局和合作社派员驻区，直接受上述两市级机关领导；户政股并入公安分局；街公所合并于公安派出所；文教股交由教育局接收，今后全市小学教育（通过中心小学）、社会教育（通过人民文化馆）的领导由教育局直接负责。其他如各项表册、家具等亦已按指定交付各有关部门接收。
    一个多月来证明：为适合城市人口、经济集中的特点，尽可能把工作集中在市级机关处理的方针是正确的。如过去区经济股系受多方领导，工商局要求它掌握全区工商情况，管理市场；合作社则需其帮助组社；银行委托办理小本贷款；贸易公司、税务局要求协助之处亦颇多。人少事多，加之对经济工作的生疏，工作是忙乱而无效率的。政策掌握亦不免产生偏向。如七区应征税工商户约四千七百多户，而区经济股所了解者仅两千余户；物价波动的情况及原因亦未能及时报告给工商局或其他有关部门加以适当处理。这些问题自工商分局成立后已能初步掌握，并按干部工作能力实行初步分工（如市场管理、座商户调查、工厂作坊户调查等）。分局无法处理的问题已能立即利用电话或信件报告市工商局请示，这表现出我们在处理经济工作上已较有系统、机动和灵活些。原街公所合并到派出所后，质量上已大为增强。它已成为市政府的基层组织，从联系群众和贯彻政策看来，已初步在市民中树立起新的工作基础。在上月底实行了值、守、巡的轮流制并由每一警士负责分担一百户的户口调查。这对治安上起了相当的保证，如呈报户口者较前显著增加，并能深入得到不少社会情况，对各有关市级机关处理问题上有不少的帮助，如区公所目前办理人民身份证明、职业介绍、分发贫苦儿童救济品等即以派出所掌握的户口为凭借。但不可否认地，派出所目前因初合并，部分地存在着宗派情绪，闹不团结的现象；又因一般警士政策、文化水平的确太低，难于很好的处理和展开工作，这当可在今后“警政合一”的方针下逐步克服。
    区政府改为区公所后，一般区长均感无下层组织之苦。机构虽经缩小，而许多具体工作则未摆脱，致工作有被动和忙乱状态。考其原因有二：市级机关在改组前以至今天在思想上和组织上未作充分接收准备工作。如民政局优抚科在区街政府改组后仅多添一人，全部优抚救济工作仍不得不由区公所担负，区公所之请示事项，亦常无结果批回；又市劳动局刚在建立，劳资纠纷案件积压颇多，区公所亦不得不予以说明暂缓解决。其次是区公所工作方式值得研究。据了解目前区公所最忙者为调解工作（以婚姻、房租、债务为最多），次为优抚救济工作，另有一些临时性的突击任务如目前之防汛工作。七区有一天调解案件达十四件之多，而一般亦有两三起。这是一个极复杂的工作，依靠区公所几个干部进行调解，确有困难且无法处理别的事情。据六区调解经验如婚姻、债务案件交托双方信赖的人调解一般可获得解决（但事后应将调解经过报告区公所），因为调解人双方并无矛盾，且愿协助当事人和解。优抚救济工作除民政局应扩大组织机构改进工作手续，减轻区的负担外，区公所在目前应求得工作方式上之改进。如优抚粮可每三个月或半年发一次，这不但可以减少自己本身工作繁忙，且可使该粮款作为烈军属的生产资金，不致发一点吃一点。并尽可能地培养积极分子或利用过去的各种委员会协助工作，但应防止他们对群众的滥用权力。
