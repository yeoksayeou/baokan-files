　　Beiping Municipal Expanded Commemoration of "July 7th" Preparatory Committee Secretariat Notice
  　No. 1
    The city's expanded commemoration of "July 7th" is scheduled to hold a mass rally on July 7th (see People's Daily and Beiping Liberation Daily on July 7th for time and location). It is hoped that all citizens and un-notified organizations will voluntarily organize themselves and actively participate. They must apply to the district governments or the competent leading agencies for entrance permits to the conference before the 6th. The committee is deeply concerned about incomplete notification, and hereby issues this notice.

　　北平市扩大纪念“七七”筹备会秘书处通告
  　第一号
    本市扩大纪念“七七”，定于七月七日举行民众大会（时间地点参看七月七日人民日报、北平解放报），希望全体市民及未通知到各组织单位，自动整队，踊跃参加，并须于六日以前，迳向各区政府或各主管领导机构申请领取大会入场证，本会深恐通知不周，特此通告。
