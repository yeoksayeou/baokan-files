　　Pingjiao Bank Supports Five Private Industrial and Mining Enterprises with Over 60 Million in Orders and Loans

　　[Our Dispatch] Since June, the Pingjin (Peiping-Tianjin) Communications Bank has adopted two loan methods, "actual value" and "order-based," to focus on supporting industrial and mining production. It has successively loaned out RMB 67,959,570. The industrial and mining enterprises that have received loans include the private Dazhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Zhongxing, Hongshun, Siwei three coal mines, and Dahua Pottery Company. Four of these five beneficiary units have solved the problem of slow product sales, and one has obtained funds to expand production. Dazhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory borrowed 3 million yuan in "actual value" terms, with borrowing and repayment calculated in real unit values of the People's Bank's "actual value" savings. This factory is one of the dyeing and weaving factories supported by the Trade Corporation's Yarn and Cloth Branch with a yarn-for-cloth program. It originally had 16 looms but now feels it is insufficient. After receiving the loan, it has ordered six looms from Shenyang, which can be shipped to Peiping by the end of July. After the new machines are added, it is estimated that daily production can increase by six bolts. Zhongxing, Hongshun, and Siwei coal mines borrowed a total of 51,057,570 yuan through "order-based" loans, ordering a total of 15,000 tons of lump and slack coal produced by these mines. These three mines have the same problem of slow sales every summer. This time, the Communications Bank ordered their products, solving the sales problem in the off-season.

　　In order to completely solve the sales problem of the three mines' coal production in the off-season, this purchase will continue in July and August. It is estimated that 45,000 tons will be purchased in three months, accounting for 75 percent of the total output of the three mines in three months, which is 60,000 tons. The loan amount obtained by Dahua Pottery Company this time is 13,900,200 yuan, and the products to be ordered are 296,000 bowls and plates produced by the factory. In May, the company had borrowed 6 million yuan from the Communications Bank in two installments to purchase raw materials. This is the third loan, mainly to solve the problem of slow sales of the company's products due to seasonal factors and to maintain continuous production. (Yu)

    交行为了彻底解决三矿淡月产煤的销路，此项收购在七、八两月中将赓续进行，预计三个月收购四万五千吨，占该三矿三个月总产量六万吨的百分之七十五。大华窑业公司此次所获贷款额是一千三百九十万零二千元，应定的产品是该厂出产的碗碟二十九万六千件。该公司在五月间曾向交行先后两次借到六百万元用以购买原料，此次是第三次贷款，主要是解决该公司产品因季节关系的滞销问题，保持生产得以持续。（宇）
