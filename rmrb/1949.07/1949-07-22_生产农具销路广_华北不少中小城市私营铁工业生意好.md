　　Production of Farm Tools Has Wide Sales
　　Private Iron Industry in Many Small and Medium Cities in North China Is Doing Good Business
　　[Report from this newspaper] Under the leadership and support of the democratic government, the private iron industry in many small and medium-sized cities in North China is facing the countryside for production and stepping up the manufacture of agricultural tools. Most of them are in short supply and are rapidly recovering and developing. After the liberation of Baoding City, the Baoding Office of the People's Bank immediately provided loan support to the private iron industry. By mid-April, the city's iron industry had increased from 138 before liberation to 173, and the number of workers had increased from 434 to 780. Julong and Tonghe Iron Plants produced more than 7,400 catties of goods in the first half of April. In addition to being sold out, a lot of old inventory was also sold. Many factory and furnace owners are preparing to expand production. In Zhangjiakou, in addition to the seven iron and foundry industries that had been closed for a long time before liberation, two new households have been established. There are currently more than 80 workers, with a monthly output of 42 tons of iron goods. In order to take care of the development of this industry, the local government reduced its tax by 15% and loaned 1 million to organize five factories to go to Tangshan to purchase coke to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. The five iron factories that closed down in Heze before liberation have all recovered, and production is constantly expanding. For example, the "Benlaixin" Iron Factory, which has a long history, used to only open the furnace three times each in spring and autumn at its most prosperous time. Now, with the help of bank loans, it opened the furnace five times in the spring. The newly established Juchang Iron Factory produces an average of 70 pots a day, and sales are very fast. Purchases often require reservations. Due to the impact of the spring famine and drought in the surrounding area of ​​Linqing City, Jinnan District, in May and June, the purchasing power of farmers was low, and the iron goods produced in the city were temporarily unsalable. Jinnan Coal and Iron Company acquired various stocks, totaling more than 400,000 yuan. There are currently 15 private iron factories in Tangshan, with more than 200 workers. Many factories have solved the difficulty of raw materials with the help of government loans. Fuxingcheng Iron Factory purchased 100 tons of pig iron with loans, expanding its June production plan. Xinsheng Electrical Iron Factory and Wanhe Iron Factory both went to Northeast China to purchase pig iron with loans. In particular, since the reasonable adjustment of wages in the iron industry in March, the workers' production enthusiasm has generally increased; Yongxing Iron Factory, with the same production conditions and workers, produced 150 pots a day in April, and increased to nearly 200 pots in June. In the first half of the year, the fifteen iron factories produced more than 21,200 pieces of various agricultural tools such as plows and ploughshares, and 63,200 pots, most of which were sold to the rural areas of eastern Hebei.
　　However, some factories have problems such as workers working too long hours and employers arbitrarily increasing or decreasing wages, which need to be resolved.

　　生产农具销路广
  　华北不少中小城市私营铁工业生意好
    【本报讯】华北许中多小城市的私营铁工业，在民主政府领导扶助下，面向农村生产，加紧制造农具，大都供不应求，正在迅速的恢复和发展。保定市解放后，人民银行保定办事处即对私营铁工业进行贷款扶助，至四月中旬，全市铁工业已由解放前的一百三十八家增至一百七十三家，工人由四百三十四人增至七百八十人。聚隆、同和两家铁厂，四月上半月共出货七千四百余斤，除全部售出外，连从前的很多存货也卖了，很多厂、炉主均准备扩大生产。张家口除原有在解放前歇业已久的七家铁工铸造业均已复工外，又新设两户，现共有工人八十余，月产铁货四十二吨。为照顾该行业之发展，当地政府在税收上减征其百分之十五，并贷款一百万，组织了五个厂赴唐山购焦炭，解决原料不足之困难。菏泽在解放前倒闭的五家铁工厂已全部恢复，生产在不断扩大，如历史较久的“本来信”铁厂，过去最兴盛时，一年只在春秋各开三次炉，现因得到银行贷款帮助，春季即开了五次炉。新设的聚昌铁厂平均日出锅七十口，销售很快，购买常需预订。冀南区临清市周围在五六月间因春荒及旱象影响，农民购买力低下，市内出产铁货一时滞销，冀南煤铁公司曾收购各种存货，总值四十余万元。唐山市现共有私营铁工厂十五家，工人二百余。不少厂因政府贷款帮助，解决了原料困难。复兴成铁厂以贷款购入生铁一百吨，扩大了六月份生产计划。新生电气铁厂、万合铁厂均以贷款赴东北购买生铁。特别是自三月份铁业中合理调整工资后，工人生产情绪普遍提高；永兴铁厂以同样的生产条件和工人，四月份每天出锅一百五十口，至六月份则提高到将近二百口。十五家铁厂上半年共制铧、犁等各种农具二万一千二百余件，锅六万三千二百余口，大部销售于冀东农村。
    但是，有些厂坊工人工作时间过长，工资由业主随便增减等问题，需要解决。
