The People's "July 7th" Commemoration
    Wang Lengzhai
    (Note: Wang Lengzhai was the Magistrate of Wanping County during the Lugou Bridge Incident. He defended Wanping County and resisted the Japanese invaders when the incident occurred.)

    Today is the 12th anniversary of the great "July 7th" Incident. Recalling this day twelve years ago, Japanese imperialism fired the sound of aggression at Lugou Bridge in our territory, awakening the Chinese nation and arousing strong roars, giving blows to the attackers. After eight years of long and arduous struggle, we finally defeated the tyrannical and aggressive powerful enemy and achieved the great victory of the nation. Our anti-imperialist national war of liberation was successful, but the domestic feudal forces and bureaucratic capital forces are still continuing to oppress the people who have suffered eight years of hardship. The people could no longer endure it, and once again rose up with the remaining courage of the anti-imperialist war to fight firmly against the oppressors. After four years of arduous journey, the people's revolutionary war was also successful. This year—1949—the "July 7th" commemoration can be regarded as the greatest day in Chinese history. Today's commemoration of "July 7th" is the people's own commemoration. Speaking from the people's position, we can of course speak freely, without as many concerns as in previous years. Nearly four years have passed since the victory, and many problems before us must be quickly determined and resolved. I am now putting them forward for the attention of the people of the country.
    
    I. Whose Credit Is the War of Resistance Against Japan Actually?
    
    Whose credit is the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan actually? Many people have not been able to understand this issue clearly. Here, I can explain it in three stages during the eight-year War of Resistance: (1) In the initial stage of the War of Resistance, the majority of the defending troops in the areas invaded by the Japanese enemy did put up strong resistance. However, after the fall of Nanjing, the Chiang government's will to resist gradually wavered, and the voices for peace talks rose again. The most active person on the Japanese side was the special agent leader Teiichi Kagesa. He was stationed in Taiwan and sent his henchmen Kuroki and others to travel between Hong Kong and Hankou, and was aided by the German Ambassador to China, Dr. Trautmann. After the Chiang government moved west to Chongqing, this negotiation was still in progress. Later, due to disagreements on the conditions, Kagesa abandoned Chiang and turned to Wang. At that time, the people of the country generally thought that the Chiang government was determined to resist Japan, but they did not know that there was such a scene of peace talks. During this period, the Chiang government's strategy for the War of Resistance was actually trapped in a state of hesitation and divergence. (2) After the withdrawal from Wuhan, the troops led by the Communist Party had already penetrated deep behind enemy lines, while the Kuomintang troops retreated backwards, leaving a vast open area for the Communist troops (referring to the CCP troops, similarly hereinafter) to bear the brunt of the anti-Japanese war. The Communist troops were good at guerrilla warfare, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy anytime and anywhere. The Japanese enemy was exhausted and hated the CCP deeply. Wang Jingwei's puppet government catered to the wishes of the Japanese and raised the anti-communist banner. During this period, the heavy responsibility of resisting the enemy and suppressing the puppet regime fell on the Communist troops. The Chiang troops hid behind the lines, happy to be idle, and even took advantage of the Communist troops' killing of the enemy to reap the benefits of the fisherman. The elite of the 300,000 Chiang troops led by Hu Zongnan were stationed in Guanzhong, not taking a single step beyond the thunder pool, facing northern Shaanxi as if facing a formidable enemy. There were no Japanese invaders in various parts of Guanzhong. The Chiang government's intention was obvious. (3) After the Pearl Harbor Incident, although the Japanese enemy initially gained some success in its operations, it gradually became unsustainable, and the battle for the ocean islands repeatedly suffered losses. Under the pressure of the tight situation, and struggling to maintain its position, military operations against China came to a halt. During this period, the Chiang government saw that the Allied forces were winning and, apart from sending a part of the expeditionary force to India and Burma, ordered the troops in the country to stand still, intending to sit back and enjoy the fruits of victory. Unexpectedly, in order to reverse the decline and boost morale, the enemy spared no effort to exert its full strength in its military operations in China. The Chiang troops were suddenly attacked by the enemy in a long drive, and in a panic abandoned Changsha and Hengyang, lost Guilin and Liuzhou, lost Dushan, and withdrew from Duyun. The enemy troops advanced rapidly and penetrated deep into Guizhou Province. Guiyang was on the verge of danger and Chongqing was shaken. On the other hand, the enemy continued to occupy key locations such as Nanyang, Laohokou, and Xixiakou. Xi'an and Hanzhong were also successively alarmed. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the speed of Chinese territory loss was no faster than these two times. There are two reasons for this: First, there were no Communist troops bearing the brunt on the Hunan-Guangxi battlefield, and the Chiang troops had to come out to fight. Second, the Chiang government valued its private army and often ordered it to preserve its strength, unwilling to sacrifice it easily, and had not prepared for it on weekdays, so it caused a retreat of three thousand miles in one breath. At this time, if the world situation had not taken a sharp turn for the worse and the fascist bloc had quickly collapsed, I don't know where the Chongqing government would have moved to? I am afraid that it would have collapsed long before the final victory, and the Chiang gang would have no way to steal the credit for itself.

    From this, it can be seen that the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance was actually due to the Chinese people's enthusiastic unity, struggle, sacrifice, and perseverance to the end, as well as the success of the people's army's guerrilla warfare, which repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on the enemy, making them dare not drive straight in, so that it was possible to support the long-term to obtain the final victory. The victory is entirely the credit of the people. This is an undeniable iron fact. The Chiang government boasts of its "leadership" achievements, completely erasing the people's contributions. In fact, the so-called "leadership" is nothing more than the strategy of passively resisting Japan and actively fighting communism as mentioned above. There is no other special feature that can be found. As for the establishment of the Allied front, this is nothing more than the necessary connection between countries in common interests, which cannot be created by the Chiang government. Because on the eve of the Pearl Harbor Incident, the United States was still Japan's arsenal for invading China. Seeing this point, one can understand. However, the sacrifice was the sacrifice of the people, and the victory was the victory of the Chiang gang. As a result, from the imperial relatives and relatives of the country to the last vestiges of cronyism, all were honored with special awards for their contributions to the War of Resistance. The victory medals of the national honor were used as arbitrary gifts for private individuals, and the property seized by the people from the enemy and puppet regimes was turned into the private pockets of the looting officials. Now the Chiang gang government has collapsed. We do not want to write more about the crimes of this group here, but the sacred credit of the people's War of Resistance must never be plundered by the reactionaries. Rectifying the name and verifying the truth is what history values. Therefore, explain this fact so that the people of the country can understand it and provide it for historical research.

    Mr. Mao Zedong said: "Anti-Japanese War, Anti-Japanese War, whose strength? Without the workers, peasants, and petty bourgeoisie, you cannot move a step." These famous words can be used as the conclusion of this section.

    II. How to Maintain the Fruits of Victory?

    Victory has been achieved, but how to maintain the fruits of victory? This is an issue that must be paid attention to. In June 1946, I went to Tokyo to testify at the Far East International Military Tribunal. After returning to China, I summarized what I had seen and heard in Japan and reported it to the people of the country, which was published in newspapers in Shanghai and Beiping. In addition to recording the situation of testifying at the tribunal, the main points of the content can be divided into four categories: (1) The United States' emphasis on Japan has been increasing day by day, and its support policy has gradually become more active. (2) Japanese aggressors have not admitted defeat and are still trying to seize the opportunity to rise again. (3) The conservative forces in Japanese politics and society have not changed, and there is still a long way to go to democracy. The military personnel in the opposition still have potential. (4) Unless both China and Japan realize true democracy, there will be no possibility of peaceful cooperation, and the future of East Asia will still be difficult to be optimistic about. I also cited these points to warn the people of the country and urged them to unite quickly. After three years, under the support of the United States, Japan has moved towards militarism again. China and Japan are neighbors, separated only by a strip of water. China has been invaded by Japan for more than a day. This eight-year War of Resistance has caused us more suffering and greater sacrifices. The Japanese issue is closely related to our country and must not be regarded as a trivial matter. In the past, the reactionary government listened to the United States' intentions in everything and remained silent on its policy toward Japan. Now that the People's Government has been established, all Chinese people have the right to ask about the Japanese issue. Here, I would like to put forward three points for the people of the country to study.

    (1) The Potsdam Declaration Must Be Thoroughly Implemented

    The most important policies towards Japan stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration are: (1) Aggressive forces and militarism must be permanently eradicated; (2) War criminals must be severely punished; (3) The Japanese government must implement democratic reforms, and the Japanese people must obtain democratic freedom; (4) Japan is only allowed to maintain the industries necessary for its economy and repayment of reparations, war industries must be destroyed, and military armaments must be dismantled. The Far Eastern Commission, organized by eleven countries, serves as the decision-making body for the implementation of the above provisions, and the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, MacArthur, is stationed in Japan for control. However, MacArthur has been in Japan for nearly four years, and none of the Potsdam provisions he has implemented have been put into practice, and he has gone against his original intention. The "Truth about American Imperialism's Support for Japan" compiled by Xinhua News Agency exposes the situation in Japan under MacArthur's control. I don't need to list them one by one here. Recently, the United States has proposed to stop Japanese reparations. According to reports, the United States Department of State issued a lengthy statement on June 10, reiterating the United States' position on unilaterally announcing the cessation of Japanese reparations on May 12 of this year. The statement claimed: "Stopping the removal of reparations materials from Japan is a necessary step to complete the Allied basic policy goals for Japan." According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch: "The United States has decided to postpone the peace treaty with Japan indefinitely in order to fully support Japan and act as an accomplice in aggression in the Far East." The above two issues further increase the seriousness of Japan's re-harming of the Far East. We must pay attention at all times. Japanese imperialism is being revived. Its political society has not made progress compared to before the war. Its military industry has not degraded compared to before the war. Its millions of latent soldiers can be armed at any time. The expansion of 300,000 armed police is a disguised form of regular troops. It dares to shoot and kill nationals of the victorious countries with the guns of the defeated country (referring to the incident in which Japanese police shot and killed our Taiwanese nationals in Shibuya, Tokyo). It dares to propose treaty provisions and territorial demands. It is still dreaming of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and "China, Japan, and Manchuria being inseparable." If Japan is revived, unless it is a truly democratic country, our China will be under tremendous threat. This is a critical moment for the life and death of the Chinese nation. We cannot but loudly call for the thorough implementation of the Potsdam Declaration. If we wait until its claws have grown and can devour people, it will be too late.

    (2) The Right to Retain a New Trial for War Criminal Okamura Yasuji

    Okamura Yasuji, the No. 1 war criminal who invaded China, was released by the reactionary government in Nanjing on January 26, and was sent back to his country on January 31 together with 260 other Japanese war criminals. Okamura's life experience, from the head of the China class to the commander-in-chief of the China Expeditionary Army, included the Jinan "May 3rd" Massacre, the Shanghai "January 28th" Incident, the Shenyang "September 18th" Incident, and the Tanggu Agreement and He-Umezu Agreement. All of these he participated in, and can be regarded as a thorough figure in the history of Japanese aggression against China. After Okamura was acquitted, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a solemn statement, declaring the right to retain a new trial, and the spokesman of the Nanjing reactionary faction sophistically argued that "this is a judicial issue." A special war criminal, lightly acquitted, is by no means a purely judicial issue. Everyone knows that the reactionary government in Nanjing has tried more than just Okamura during the three years, but none is as important as Okamura's crimes. For example, Sakai Takashi was only the commander of the Guangzhou garrison division, and Tani Hisao was a subordinate of Matsui Iwane. Both were sentenced to death by the Nanjing Ministry of National Defense Military Tribunal. What's more, Okamura Yasuji served as the commander of the North China Battlefield Corps, the commander-in-chief of the North China Dispatch Army, and the commander-in-chief of the China Dispatch Army in the invasion of China, implementing the three-all policy (loot all, burn all, kill all) as an executioner? His crimes are no less than those of Matsui Iwane. If he can be acquitted, then wouldn't Matsui Iwane, Doihara, Itagaki, etc. who were executed, and Hata Shunroku, etc. who were sentenced to life imprisonment, be wronged? The Far East International Military Tribunal would not have to be established, and the Potsdam Declaration could be regarded as waste paper. Therefore, the release of Okamura Yasuji is a very important issue, not an ordinary judicial issue, but an issue of determining the responsibility of the enemy's aggression. We have worked hard in the international tribunal to determine the responsibility of the enemy's aggression and the establishment of the war criminals' atrocities. We must never allow the reactionary government in Nanjing to ruin it. The reactionary government in Nanjing is not the Japanese government after all. Could it be said that we want to learn from Duke Mu of Qin and keep Okamura as Meng Mingshi to repay Jin? The People's Liberation Army's declaration to retain the right of a new trial, we absolutely support it to promote its realization.

    (3) Taiwan Must Be Liberated by the Chinese People

    Taiwan was originally our country's territory. After being seized by Japan, it was ruled by its evil claws for 51 years. It was not until this victory in the War of Resistance that it returned to the embrace of the motherland. The character of the Taiwanese people is revolutionary, because for 50 years they have been ruled and oppressed by the Japanese, and the resentment in their hearts has nowhere to vent, so the revolutionary potential is even greater. Many Taiwanese people still believe in Zheng Chenggong, the national hero of 300 years ago. After returning to the motherland, it was ruled by Kuomintang corrupt elements, and it was still replaced by the method of looting, and because Taiwan's production was rich, it was regarded as a gold-digging area, so it completely implemented control over economic trade, competing with the people for profits everywhere, and exploiting even peddlers. The Taiwanese people could not tolerate it, and thus issued the roar of the "February 28th" Incident in 1947. After this incident, the Kuomintang reactionary government suppressed it with heavy troops, and the pain of the Taiwanese people being oppressed has not been relieved until now. Recently, the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang have been increasingly weakened, and they want to use Taiwan as a base for their final struggle. At the same time, the United States is also trying to use Taiwan as a fortress for anti-communism in the Far East. This conspiracy has been exposed. According to Chinese and foreign newspapers, there are several aspects: (1) Lepphan, Director of the China Branch of the United States Economic Cooperation Administration, went to Taiwan from Shanghai (referring to when Shanghai was not liberated) to plan to expand the scope of the branch in Taiwan and add railway afforestation and other businesses. (2) MacArthur openly proposed that before the peace treaty with Japan, Taiwan still belongs to the Allied Headquarters, but is now occupied by China. (3) The United States intends to incorporate Taiwan's economy into the Japanese economy under American control. (4) The United States is plotting the "Taiwan Independence Movement", inciting the Taiwan landlords Liao Wenyi and Liao Wenkui brothers to preside over it. Liao and others have issued calls for Taiwan independence under MacArthur's orders. (5) MacArthur has sent representatives to Taiwan to engage in military, political, economic, and espionage activities. (6) The United States and Britain are conspiring to divide the "areas of responsibility" in Southeast Asia in order to support local reactionary forces and suppress people's resistance. Taiwan has been included in the United States' "area of responsibility." Looking at the above series of reports, it can be seen that the United States has ambitions for Taiwan. Taiwan is in fact the territory of China, and the Cairo Conference and the Potsdam Declaration have clearly stipulated that it should be returned to China in the treaty. It must not be allowed to be coveted by other countries. Now that so many facts have been discovered, we should vow to strive to the death until we achieve liberation by the Chinese people themselves.

    The above three major issues must be thoroughly achieved in order to maintain the fruits of the victory in the War of Resistance. Today, when we commemorate "July 7th" under the leadership of the people's leader Chairman Mao, we dare to shout loudly from the people's standpoint, calling on the people of the whole country to strengthen unity and work together.

　　人民的“七七”纪念
    王冷斋
    （按：王冷斋是芦沟桥事变时宛平县县长，事变发生时守卫宛平县城，抵抗日寇进犯。）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    今天是伟大的“七七”第十二周年纪念日。回忆十二年前的今日，日本帝国主义在我国领土芦沟桥，发出侵略的炮声，把中华民族震醒了，激起强烈的怒吼，予打击者以打击。经过八年长时间的苦斗，终于打倒横暴侵凌的强敌，达成民族伟大的胜利。我们反帝国主义的民族战争成功了，但是国内的封建势力、官僚资本势力，仍在向受过八年苦难的人民继续压迫。人民忍无可忍，重行奋起反帝战争的余勇，对压迫者坚强搏斗。经过四年艰苦的途程，人民革命战争又成功了。今年——一九四九年——的“七七”纪念，可以算得中华有史以来最伟大的日子。今天纪念“七七”是人民自己的纪念，我们以人民地位来说话，当然是畅所欲言，不似以前每年有许多的顾忌。胜利至今已近四载，摆在面前的许多问题，必须迅速确定和解决。我现在把它提出来，请国人注意。
    一、抗战究竟是谁的功劳？
    抗战胜利究竟是谁的功劳？这问题有许多人尚未能明了。在这里，我可以就八年抗战中分为三个时期说明：（１）在抗战初期，日敌所进攻的地方，当地多数守军确是坚强抵抗。及南京沦陷以后，蒋政府抗战意志渐形摇动，于是和议之声再起。日人方面进行最力的为特务头目影佐祯昭。他驻在台湾，派遣徒党黑木等奔走港（香港）汉（汉口）之间，并由德国驻华大使陶德曼从中赞助。及蒋政府西迁重庆，此议尚在继续商谈中。后以条件不协，影佐始舍蒋而就汪。当时国人总以为蒋政府决心抗战，不知尚有此和谈之一幕。在这时期中，蒋政府对于抗战策略，实陷于徘徊歧路的境地。（２）武汉撤守以后，共产党领导的军队已经深入敌后，国民党军队则向后退却，腾出一空阔地段，由共军（指中共军队下仿此）当抗日之冲。共军善于打游击战，随时随地予敌重创。日敌疲于奔命，乃切齿痛恨中共。汪精卫伪府逢迎日人的意旨，遂竖起反共旗帜。在这时期抗敌讨伪的重责已集于共军身上，蒋军躲在背后乐得清闲，甚至于乘共军杀敌之时，起而坐收渔人之利。由胡宗南统率的三十万蒋军的精华，驻守关中，不越雷池一步，面对陕北如临大敌。关中各地并无日寇，蒋政府用意所在，不问可知。（３）珍珠港事变发生后，日敌初期作战虽尚侥幸得手，以后渐呈不支，海洋岛屿之争夺战辄次失利。在形势紧迫勉强挣扎之下，对华军事遂归停顿。在这时期，蒋政府见同盟国各军胜利在望，除派遣一部分远征军赴印缅以外，在国内的军队均令按兵不动，意图坐享其成。不料敌人为挽回颓势，振作士气起见，对于在华军事不惜拼其全力以求一逞。蒋军骤遭敌人长驱来袭，仓皇间弃长（长沙）衡（衡阳），失桂（桂林）柳（柳州），丧独山，撤都匀，敌军迅速前进深入黔境，贵阳濒危，重庆震动。另一方面，敌复续陷南阳、老河口、西峡口等要地，西安汉中亦相继告警。抗战八年间，中国失地之速无过于这两次。这里有两种原因：第一，在湘桂战场上无共军当冲，蒋军不得不出马应战。第二，蒋政府重视其私有军队，常令保存实力，不肯轻易牺牲，平日未尝准备，所以造成一口气三千里的退即。在这时候，假使不是世界局势急转直下，法西斯集团迅速崩溃，不知重庆政府要向何处搬家？恐怕等不到最后胜利早已垮台，那蒋帮也无从贪天之功以为己有了。
    由此可见，八年抗战的胜利，实由于我国人民激昂团结，奋斗牺牲，坚持到底，以及人民军队游击战的成功，辄予敌人以重大的打击，使他不敢长驱直进，始能长期支持获得最后胜利。胜利完全是人民的功劳，这是无可否认的铁的事实。而蒋政府自夸“领导”之功，对于人民功劳一概抹杀。其实所谓“领导”，也不过如上文所说的消极抗日积极反共的策略，此外实无法寻出其他特续。至同盟阵线的成立，这不过各国在共同利害上应有的联系，并非蒋政府所能造成。因为珍珠港事变的前夕，美国尚是日本侵华的军火库，看到这一点就可以明了，但是牺牲是人民的牺牲，胜利是蒋帮的胜利。于是上自皇亲国戚，下至裙带末流，无不荣膺抗战有功的特赏。以国家名器的胜利勋章作为私人任意的赠品，以人民所被没入敌伪的财产，转饱劫搜官吏的私囊。现在蒋帮政府已垮台了，我们在这里不欲多写这一群的罪恶，可是人民神圣抗战的功劳，绝不许为反动者所攘窃。正名核实，历史所贵。所以说明这一段的事实，俾国人得以明了，并供修史的参考。
    毛泽东先生说：“抗日抗日，是谁之力？离了工人农民与小资产阶级，你就不能走动一步。”这几句名言，可作本段的结论。
    二、怎样保持胜利的成果？
    胜利实现了，可是怎样保持胜利的成果？这是必须注意的问题。一九四六年六月，我到东京出席远东国际军事法庭作证，回国后，曾将在日本的闻见撮要向国人报告，登载上海、北平各报。内容除纪载出席法庭作证情形外，其他要点约可分为四项：（１）美国对于日本的重视已逐日增进，扶植政策亦渐趋积极。（２）日本侵略者并未承认失败，仍图伺机再起。（３）日本政治社会之保守势力并未改变，去民主尚远，在野军人仍具潜力。（４）若非中日两国均实现真正民主，绝无和平携手之可能，东亚前途仍难乐观。我并援引这几点向国人警告，促速团结。现在经过三年，日本在美国扶植之下，又向军国主义前途迈进。中日两国比邻，相距只一衣带水之隔；中国受日本侵凌并非一日，这次八年的抗战，我们受祸更烈、牺牲更巨；日本问题与我国息息相关，绝不可视同等闲。以前反动政府事事听从美国意旨，对日政策默无一言，现在人民政府成立，凡属中国人民均有权过问对日问题，在这里因特提出三点以供国人研究。
    （一）要彻底实行波茨坦宣言
    波茨坦宣言中所规定对日各项政策，最重要的为：（１）侵略势力和军国主义必须永久铲除；（２）战争罪犯必须严惩；（３）日本政府必须实行民主改革，日本人民必须获得民主自由；（４）日本仅许维持其经济及偿付赔款所必需的工业，战争工业必须摧毁，军备武装必须解除。由十一国组织远东委员会，为执行以上条款之决策机关，并由盟军最高统帅麦克阿瑟驻日管制。可是麦氏在日已近四年之久，所执行之波茨坦条款无一见诸实行，且反背道而驰。新华社所辑“美帝扶日真相”一书内所纪载，将麦氏管制下的日本情况暴露无遗，我在这里殊不必一一列举。最近美国竟提出停止日本赔偿。据报载美国国务院于六月十日发表一项冗长的声明，重申美国于本年五月十二日片面宣布停止日本赔偿之决议的立场，声明宣称：“停止向日本搬取赔偿物资，为完成盟国对日基本政策目标之必要步骤。”又据新华社电称：“美国决定无限期拖延对日和约。以图全力扶植日本，充当在远东的侵略帮凶”。以上两项问题，更足加紧日本再祸远东的严重性。我们要时刻注意，日本帝国主义正在复活，它的政治社会较战前仍无进步，它的军事工业视战前并未退化，它的数百万潜伏军人随时均可武装起来，三十万武装警察的扩充即是正规军队的变相。它敢以战败国的枪弹射杀战胜国的侨民（指东京涩谷日警射杀我国台侨事件），它敢于提出和约条款，提出领土要求，它仍在憧憬着“大东亚共荣圈”，“中日满不可分”。假使日本复兴，除非它是一个真正民主的国家，我们中国必受绝大的威胁。这是中华民族生死利害的关头，我们不能不大声疾呼，要求彻底实行波茨坦宣言。假使等到它的爪牙长成可以噬人，那就来不及了。
    （二）要保留战犯冈村宁次更审权利
    第一号侵华战犯冈村宁次，竟于一月二十六日为南京反动政府所释放，并于一月三十一日同其他日本战犯二百六十名一起遣送回国。冈村一生经历，自中国班员课长起，以至中国派遣军总司令止，其中经过如济南“五三”惨案，上海的“一二八”，沈阳的“九一八”，以及塘沽协定、何梅协定等，无不参与其间，在日本对华侵略史中，可算得彻头彻尾的人物。冈村被判无罪后，中国共产党中央即针对着发表严正宣言，声明保留更审的权利，而南京反动派发言人竟狡辩说“这是司法问题”。一个特号战犯，轻轻的无罪开释，绝不是单纯司法问题。尽人皆知，南京反动政府三年间所审讯的战犯不止冈村一人，要皆不若冈村罪犯之重要，如酒井隆不过广州驻屯军师团长，谷寿夫则是松井石根的部属，两犯均由南京国防部军事法庭判处死刑。何况冈村宁次于侵华之役，连续为华北战地兵团长，华北派遣军总司令，及中国派遣军总司令，实施三光政策（抢光、烧光、杀光）之刽子手？他的罪恶不在松井石根之下。假使他可以无罪释放，那么，松井石根、土肥原、板垣等处死刑，畑俊六等处无期徒刑，岂不冤枉？远东国际军事法庭既可以不必设立，波茨坦宣言也可以视同废纸。所以冈村宁次的释放，这问题实在是非常的重大，不是寻常司法问题，而是敌人侵略责任之确定问题。我们在国际法庭上辛辛苦苦争得敌人侵略责任的确定，和战犯暴行罪状的成立，决不能任由南京反动政府所断送。南京反动政府究竟不是日本政府，难道说要学秦穆公，留着冈村作报晋的孟明视吗？人民解放军宣言保留更审的权利，我们绝对拥护以促其实现。
    （三）台湾必须由中国人民解放
    台湾本为我国领土，被日本攫取以后，以魔爪统治达五十一年。直至这一次抗战胜利，始重归祖国怀抱。台湾人的性格是革命的，因为五十年间被日人所统治压迫，内心积愤无处可泄，故革命的潜蓄力亦愈大。许多台湾人仍信仰三百年前的民族英雄郑成功。复归祖国以后，被国民党贪污分子统治，仍旧以劫搜的方法代接收，且以台湾出产丰富，认为可以淘金的地带，于是对于经济贸易完全实施统制，处处与民争利，剥削及于贩夫走卒。台人无可容忍，因而发出一九四七年“二二八”的怒吼。这事发生后，国民党反动政府更以重兵镇压，直到现在台人被压迫的痛苦，始终未能解除。近来国民党反动势力日见穷蹙，要想把台湾作为最后挣扎的根据地，同时美国亦正想利用台湾作为远东防共的堡垒。这项阴谋已经暴露的，据中外报纸纪载约有数端：（１）美国经济合作总署中国分署署长莱普汉由上海赴台湾（指上海未解放时），计划扩大该署在台湾的范围，增添铁路造林等业务。（２）麦克阿瑟公然提出在对日和约前，台湾仍属于盟军总部，现在不过是由中国占领。（３）美国拟将台湾经济并入在美国管制下的日本经济中。（４）美国正在策动“台湾独立运动”，嗾使台湾大地主廖文毅廖文奎兄弟主持其事，廖等已受麦克阿瑟的命令发出台湾独立叫嚣。（５）麦克阿瑟已派遣代表赴台湾，从事军事、政治、经济、特务各种的活动。（６）美英两国阴谋划分东南亚洲“责任范围”，以扶植当地反动势力，镇压人民反抗，台湾已被划入美国“责任范围”内。观以上一连串的报告，可见美国之于台湾实有野心。台湾在事实上本为中国的领土，在条约上开罗会议与波茨坦宣言均有明文规定归还中国，绝不能任由他国觊觎。现在既然有这许多事实发现，我们应当誓死力争，非达到由中国人民自行解放不止。
    上述的三大问题，必须彻底做到，方可算得保持抗战胜利的成果。我们今日在人民领袖毛主席领导之下纪念“七七”时，敢以人民立场大声呼喊，唤起全国同胞加紧团结共同努力。　　【新华社北平六日电】
