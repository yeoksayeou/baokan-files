　　The Sixth District of Shijiazhuang City experienced an armyworm outbreak in most villages around the 12th of this month. Initially, the outbreaks were on grass, subsequently spreading into fields of crops, covering an area of approximately ten hectares. As of the 14th, some sweet potatoes and beans had been completely devoured, while corn, sorghum, and millet in some areas had their leaves partially eaten.

　　In the Hebei-Central area, the counties of Wuji, Ba, Shenze, Jin, Xinle, and Qingyuan have also seen outbreaks in a majority of their villages. The larger worms are now one inch long. In Nan Zhaozhuang Village, Shenze County, armyworms have devoured the grass on a hundred-mu cemetery and are spreading towards the grain fields. However, armyworms on another hundred-mu of grain fields have been largely eliminated. Xinle County has also eradicated the pests on twenty mu of land. Both areas are currently engaged in capturing and eliminating the armyworms.

　　Methods for preventing and controlling armyworms:

　　1. Collecting eggs: Armyworm infestations begin with moths laying eggs. The eggs are white, smaller than rice grains, arranged in rows on the underside of the tips of the grain leaves. After egg-laying, the leaves wither, turn grey, and curl up. The moths are purplish-blue, slightly white. They are active at dusk for mating. Insect nets or light traps can be used to kill them. Therefore, for a few days before and after the grain spikes, fields should be regularly inspected. Collected egg-covered leaves should be burned. It is best to carry a small cloth bag when collecting. Collecting eggs is a very meticulous task, and if mobilization is good, the effect will be significant. Otherwise, in areas without a foundation or experience, it is best to organize households or groups of a few households to work together to avoid wasting labor.

　　2. Capturing and Killing: Based on the experience of the Ministry of Agriculture’s Agricultural Technology Extension Team in Wan, Tang, Wang, Yi, and Man counties last year in controlling armyworms, there are two effective methods: First, hold two small sticks, about two to two and a half feet long and about the thickness of a thumb, in your hands. Walk along the ridges in the infested fields, covering two ridges at a time. Use the sticks to knock the grain stalks inward (i.e., along the ridge between the two rows). The armyworms crawling on the crops will fall into the furrows, where they can be stepped on and crushed. This method can be widely used by women and children. Each able-bodied worker can cover 1.5 to 2 mu per day. Second, use an armyworm cart. The armyworm cart is widely used by the masses in counties such as Yi, Man, Wan, and Tang, and they are accustomed to its use. During last year’s armyworm control efforts, the Agricultural Technology Extension Team worked with the masses to research and improve the cart, enhancing its efficiency. The cart's shape remains the same, but two small sticks, about a foot and a half long and the thickness of a finger, are diagonally inserted in a cross shape on the two vertical beams, replacing the need to manually knock. The front wheels are modified into gear shapes to increase vibration, causing the worms to fall off naturally. A round pebble is placed in the cloth bag, and the pebble rotates up and down in the bag due to the vibration of the gears, mostly crushing and killing the armyworms in the bag.

　　After this cart is modified, each person can push it across eight to ten mu of grain fields per day. Previously, according to the masses, each person could only push it across six mu of land per day. This type of cart can be widely adopted by leaders in areas where armyworms are prevalent.

　　3. Implementing Trenching: When armyworms initially appear in cemeteries or grasslands, in order to prevent them from spreading to the seedling fields and to facilitate collective extermination, surround the affected area with trenches. The width and depth of the trenches are not fixed, the main purpose is that the trenches facilitate monitoring and capture. It is suitable for collective extermination by the masses. Secondly, this method can also be used sometimes on individual plots. When necessary, individual interests should be subordinate to the interests of the masses, but it should be done with the consent of the owner of the land, or after everyone has discussed it.

　　打黏虫的办法
    翟雨兹
    石家庄市六区，于本月十二日大部村庄发生了黏虫，初发生于草上，相继爬入田禾，面积已达十顷左右，截至十四日止，已有部分甘薯、豆子被吃光，其他玉米、高粱、谷子亦有部分地区吃花了叶子。
    冀中区，无极、霸县、深泽、晋县、新乐、清苑六个县亦已有多数村庄发生，大的现在有一寸长，深泽县南赵庄村百亩坟地的青草吃光后已向谷地蔓延，另有一百亩谷田黏虫已被消灭大部，新乐有二十亩地，也已消灭。现在两个地区均在着手捕打。
    黏虫的防治法：
    １、采卵：黏虫发生，先由蛾子产卵，卵粒为白色，比米粒还小，一道一道的排列在谷叶的背面尖端，产卵后叶枯灰，卷缩，蛾子为紫花色，稍白，黄昏时活动进行交配，用捕虫网或灯火诱杀都可。因之在谷子吐穗前后几天，应经常到地里检查。采下的卵叶，要烧掉，采时最好要带一个小布口袋。其次采卵是一个很细致的工作，如动员得好，效果很大，否则在没有基础，又没有经验地区，最好以户为单位，或几户自由组合进行，以防耗费劳力。
    ２捕杀：根据去年农业部农业技术推广队在完、唐、望、易、满等县，防治黏虫的经验，有两种有效办法：一是两手持两根小杆，长约二尺至二尺半，有大拇指粗即可，在发生黏虫的地里，顺垄前进，每次两垄，用两杆向里（即两垄间顺垄走着的地方）敲打谷秸，如此爬在庄稼上的黏虫，就可掉在垄间，随即用脚踩蹉。这种办法，妇女儿童都可广泛使用，每个整劳力每天可打一亩半至二亩。一是黏虫车，黏虫车的使用，在易、满、完、唐等县群众中使用较广，并有使用习惯。农业技术推广队去年在防治黏虫过程中，与群众共同结合，相互研究，将该车加以改造，提高了工作效能，车子仍是原形，另外在两个竖梁上，用两根小杆，长一尺半，有手指粗即可，成十字形斜插在两个梁上，代替两手敲动。前边的轮子，改为齿轮形，增添震动力，可使虫子自然掉下。布包中放上一个圆石头蛋，借用齿轮的震动力，石头蛋在布包中上下旋转，将掉在布包中的黏虫，大部给碰砸在包中死亡。
    这个车子经过改造后，每人每天可推到八亩至十亩地的谷子。以往的车子，据群众谈每人每天只能推到六亩地。这个车子的形式，在黏虫发生地区，各地领导上可广泛采用。
    ３、施行掘沟法：当黏虫初发生于坟地、草地时，为使不致蔓延苗田，便利集体消灭，应施行周围挖沟法，沟宽深都不拘，主要是有沟便利监视，便利捕打，适宜群众集体扑灭。其次如单独一块地有时，也可采用这种办法，必要时个人利益应服从大众的利益、不过要经过原地主人同意，或大家商量。
