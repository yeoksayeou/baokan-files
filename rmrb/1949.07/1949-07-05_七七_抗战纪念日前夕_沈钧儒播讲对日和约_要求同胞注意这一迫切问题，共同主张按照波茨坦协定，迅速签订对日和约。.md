[Ping City News] Mr. Shen Junru, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, broadcast on July 3rd from the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station "Commemorating 'July 7th' with the Principles of the Potsdam Agreement." The full text of his speech is as follows: Compatriots across China! Friends at home and abroad!

The sacred memorial day of the July 7th Anti-Japanese War has arrived. I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words to all my compatriots and friends at home and abroad.

As everyone knows, we Chinese people fought against Japanese imperialism for a full eight years and two months. Our people across the country paid the price of tens of millions of lives and countless properties to finally drive the Japanese fascists out of China. In August 1945, Japanese imperialism was defeated and surrendered unconditionally. But did we Chinese people gain victory? No. We did not reap the fruits of victory. Our eight years of bloodshed and sacrifice in the war of resistance did not yield any returns.

The reason for this should be clear to everyone: Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the Chinese people and offered the fruits of the eight-year War of Resistance to American imperialism. Although Japanese imperialism was defeated and surrendered, China once again became the target of American imperialist aggression. The Kuomintang reactionary government willingly serves as a tool of imperialism, beholden to its every whim. China was the country that contributed the most and sacrificed the most in the War of Resistance against Japan, but China was not even officially allowed to send troops to participate in the occupation of Japan. Imperialism did not allow the Chinese people to participate in the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan. American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek even used all means to support Japanese warlords and reactionaries, preparing for a new war of aggression against the Chinese people in the future. Therefore, I say that although Japanese fascism has been defeated and surrendered, we Chinese people have still not achieved victory. The only way for the Chinese people to truly achieve victory is to overthrow imperialism, overthrow feudalism, overthrow bureaucratic capitalism, eliminate the Kuomintang reactionary government, and establish a truly democratic coalition government that can represent the Chinese people.

Now, I am very pleased to tell you all that our goal is about to be achieved. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army's victories in all battles, the Chinese people have basically defeated the Chinese reactionaries, eliminated the Nanjing reactionary government, and the remaining remnant forces of the reactionaries are no longer qualified to represent the Chinese people. The new Political Consultative Conference without the participation of reactionaries is being actively prepared. Soon after, through the new Political Consultative Conference, we will establish the Central Joint Government of the People's Republic of China. This Central Joint Government includes all revolutionary classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations in the country, and it represents the interests of more than 90 percent of the people in the country. There is no doubt that this people's democratic coalition government is supported by all the Chinese people, and it has full qualifications, full strength, and full legal basis to represent all the Chinese people and handle all of China's foreign affairs. The issue of the peace treaty with Japan is one of the most important issues among them.

The issue of the peace treaty with Japan is a major issue that is closely related to the interests of the Chinese people and to world peace.

We understand that the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism has always been willing to delay the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, preferably forever, so that Japan will always be under MacArthur's military occupation, and American imperialism can support Japanese fascist war criminals, warlords, financial cliques, and all reactionaries, using Japan as a base to launch a new imperialist war of aggression.

In the four years since the war, countless facts have proven that the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism has violated the Potsdam Agreement and various international agreements jointly agreed upon by the Allied countries during the war, wanting to monopolize Japan and support the remaining forces of Japanese fascism, planning to stage a comeback. The United States has consistently opposed consultation by China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom to resolve the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. The United States has adopted many reactionary policies in Japan, such as releasing Japanese fascist war criminals, preserving Japanese financial cliques, supporting Japanese reactionary forces, and secretly expanding Japan's military power. On May 12th of this year, the United States unilaterally announced the cancellation of Japan's temporary compensation plan and terminated Japan's compensation payments. The United States ordered Chiang Kai-shek to use Japanese prisoners of war to attack the Chinese People's Liberation Army and released the most heinous Japanese fascist war criminals in China.

The Chinese people will not allow this shameless reactionary behavior to continue. Peace-loving people all over the world, including the people of Japan, do not approve of this aggressive policy of American imperialism to support Japanese fascism.

Now the Chinese people have stood up. The people already have the power to deal with this issue that is most closely related to the interests of the people. The Chinese people will certainly not let go and must ensure that the issue of the peace treaty with Japan is resolved quickly, fairly, and reasonably.

First of all, the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan lasted the longest and sacrificed the most. China should have the main say in rebuilding peace in the Far East. At the very least, China should consult with the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom to resolve the issue of the peace treaty with Japan.

Secondly, we cannot allow Japanese fascism to rise again and endanger the peace of China and the world. Therefore, the peace treaty with Japan must stipulate the complete elimination of Japanese militarism and the democratization of Japan.

We oppose the long-term occupation of Japan by the United States and oppose using Japan as a base for launching imperialist wars of aggression.

Therefore, the sooner the peace treaty with Japan is signed, the better, and it cannot be delayed any longer. After the peace treaty is signed, the American army should withdraw from Japan, so that Japan can become a truly democratic country and establish good diplomatic and trade relations with the new China.

Recently, at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference held in Paris, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky proposed to convene a foreign ministers conference with China's participation on a regular basis in accordance with the principles of the Potsdam Agreement to prepare for the peace treaty with Japan. Although this proposal was rejected by the American and British foreign ministers, we Chinese people 100% support this proposal from the Soviet Union. We Chinese people believe that the Potsdam Agreement, which has been agreed upon by major countries, should serve as the basis for resolving post-war peace issues. Only by convening a four-nation foreign ministers conference of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom for mutual consultation among major powers can the issue of the peace treaty with Japan be resolved quickly and reasonably, and it is most beneficial to world peace.

Therefore, I urge all compatriots and friends at home and abroad to pay attention to this urgent issue and jointly advocate for the signing of a peace treaty with Japan in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Here, we are stepping up preparations for convening the new Political Consultative Conference and organizing a coalition government, preparing that in the near future, the people's democratic New China will send plenipotentiary representatives to handle the issue of the peace treaty with Japan and establish lasting peace in the East.

Finally, I would like to declare to friends at home and abroad that China's War of Resistance against Japan mainly relied on the strength and sacrifices of the people to defeat Japanese fascism. Therefore, the Chinese people will never let go of handling the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. Any decision on this issue, if not agreed upon by the Chinese people, will inevitably be deemed invalid, just like the traitorous treaties signed by Chiang Kai-shek in the past.

　　“七七”抗战纪念日前夕
  　沈钧儒播讲对日和约
    要求同胞注意这一迫切问题，共同主张按照波茨坦协定，迅速签订对日和约。
    【平市讯】中国民主同盟中央常务委员沈钧儒先生于七月三日在北平新华广播电台播讲“以波茨坦协定原则纪念‘七七’”，讲词全文如下：全中国的同胞！国内国外的朋友们！
    神圣的七七抗日战争纪念日到来了。趁这机会我想和全国同胞，在国内国外的朋友们，讲几句话。
    大家都知道，我们中国人民和日本帝国主义，打了整整八年零两个月的仗。我们全国人民用了几千万生命和无量数财产作为代价，终于把日本法西斯，驱逐出中国。到一九四五年八月，日本帝国主义算是打败了，无条件投降了。但是我们中国人民得到了胜利没有呢？没有。我们没有收得胜利的果实。我们八年抗战的流血牺牲也没有得到代价。
    这原因大家都应该明白：蒋介石出卖了中国人民，把八年抗战胜利的果实，捧献给美帝国主义。日本帝国主义虽然战败了，投降了，但是中国又重新变成了美帝国主义的侵略目标。国民党反动政府甘心做帝国主义的工具，仰帝国主义的鼻息。中国是在抗日战争中尽力最多，牺牲最多的国家，但是中国竟没有正式派军队，去参加对日本的占领。帝国主义不允许中国人民参加对日和约的准备工作。美帝国主义和蒋介石甚至用一切方法，扶植日本军阀和反动派，准备将来向中国人民进行新的侵略战争。所以我说，日本法西斯虽说失败了，投降了，我们中国人民却依然没有得到胜利，中国人民要真正得到胜利，一定只有打倒帝国主义，打倒封建主义，打倒官僚资本主义，消灭国民党反动派的卖国政府，建立真正足以代表中国人民的民主联合政府才有办法。
    现在，我十分愉快地告诉大家：我们的目的快要达到了。由于中国共产党的正确领导，人民解放军的百战百胜，中国人民已经从基本上打垮了中国反动派，消灭了南京反动政府，剩下的反动派的残余势力，已再没有资格来代表中国人民了。没有反动派参加的新的政治协商会议，正在积极筹备之中。不久以后，通过新的政治协商会议，我们就要成立中华人民民主共和国的中央联合政府。这个中央联合政府，包含了国内各革命阶级，各民主党派，各人民团体，它代表了全国百分之九十以上的人民的利益。毫无疑问，这个人民的民主联合政府是全中国人民所拥护的，它有充分的资格，充分的实力，充分的法理根据，来代表全中国人民，处理中国对外的一切问题。对日和约问题就是其中最最重要的问题之一。
    对日和约问题是和中国人民利益有密切关系的大问题，也是和世界和平有密切关系的大问题。
    我们明白，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，一向情愿要把对日和约问题拖延下去，最好是永远不签订和约，使日本永远在麦克阿瑟的武力霸占之下，使美帝国主义可以扶植日本的法西斯战犯、军阀、财阀、一切反动派，以日本作为基地，以发动新的帝国主义侵略战争。
    战后四年以来，有无数件事实，可以证明，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，违反了波茨坦协定以及战时盟国所共同商定的各项国际协议，要想独占日本，并且扶植日本法西斯残余势力，作卷土重来之计。美国始终不赞成由中苏美英四大国协商，以解决对日和约问题。美国在日本采取了极多的反动政策，如象释放日本法西斯战犯，保全日本财阀，扶植日本反动势力，暗中扩张日本的军力。本年五月十二日美国片面宣布取消日本临时赔偿计划，终止日本的赔偿交付。美国命令蒋介石用日本俘虏进攻中国人民解放军，并且把罪大恶极的日本法西斯在华战犯释放回去。
    中国人民不容许这种无耻的反动行为继续下去。全世界爱好和平的人民，包含日本的人民在内，也都不赞成美帝国主义这一种扶植日本法西斯的侵略政策。
    现在中国的人民已经站起来了。人民已经有力量来处理这个和人民利益最有关系的问题了。中国人民一定不放松，一定要使对日和约问题，很快得到公平合理的解决。
    首先，中国人民对日抗战，时间最长久，牺牲最重大。对于重建远东和平，中国应当有主要的发言权。中国最少应当和苏联、美国、英国，共同协商来解决对日和约问题。
    其次，我们不能容许日本法西斯再起来，危害中国和全世界的和平。因此，对日和约必须规定彻底消灭日本军国主义，并使日本国内民主化。
    我们反对美国长期占领日本，反对以日本作为发动帝国主义侵略战争的基地。
    因此对日和约，越早签订越好，不容许再拖延下去。和约签订以后，美军就应当退出日本，使日本成为真正民主的国家，和新中国建立良好的外交及贸易的关系。
    最近在巴黎举行的四国外长会议中，苏联外长维辛斯基提议，依照波茨坦协定的原则定期召集有中国参加的外长会议，以准备对日和约。这一提议虽然被美英外长所拒绝接受，但是我们中国人民，却百分之百的赞成苏联这一个提议。我们中国人民认为经过各大国同意的波茨坦协定，应当作为解决战后和平问题的基础。只有召开中苏美英四国外长会议，进行大国间相互协商，才能迅速合理解决对日和约问题，而且对于世界和平最有利益。
    因此，我要求全国同胞，在国内外的朋友们，大家注意这一个迫切的问题，共同主张按照波茨坦协定，签订对日和约。我们这里，正在加紧进行筹备召开新政协和组织联合政府的工作，准备在不久的将来，人民民主的新中国，要派出全权代表，处理对日和约的问题，建立东方持久的和平。
    最后，我要向国内国外的朋友们声明，中国抗日战争主要是依靠人民的力量与人民的牺牲，把日本法西斯打败。所以中国人民决不放松对日和约问题的处理。对于这一问题的任何决定，倘使不经过中国人民的同意，必然作为无效，如象蒋介石过去所签订的卖国条约一样。
