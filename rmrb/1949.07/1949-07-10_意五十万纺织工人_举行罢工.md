　　Italian Textile Workers: 500,000 Strong
  　Hold Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th] Rome: On July 5th, 500,000 textile workers across Italy, under the leadership of the Italian Textile Workers' General Union, held a 24-hour general strike. They were protesting the employers' refusal to improve the workers' economic situation when signing a new labor contract. Trade unions of the Christian Democrats, Saragat, and Republicans participated in the strike.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th] Reports from various sources: The London dockworkers' strike, held in sympathy with the Canadian sailors' strike, expanded on June 29th. As of July 5th, 8,484 out of a total of 27,000 dockworkers had gone on strike. London dockworkers originally only refused to unload two Canadian ships in the Port of London that had been on strike for over two months. However, the employers threatened to fire the workers if they did not unload all ships. This provoked the workers' anger and expanded the strike. The Port of London is now partially paralyzed, with one hundred ships frozen due to the strike.

　　意五十万纺织工人
  　举行罢工
    【新华社北平八日电】罗马讯：七月五日，意大利全国五十万纺织工人，在意大利纺织总工会发动下举行二十四小时总罢工。抗议雇主在签订新的劳动合同时拒绝改善工人的经济情况。基督教民主党、萨拉盖特及共和分子的工会都参加了罢工。
    【新华社北平八日电】各方报道：伦敦码头工人为同情加拿大海员罢工而举行的罢工，于六月二十九日扩大，至七月五日止，在全部二万七千码头工人中，罢工者已达八千四百八十四人。伦敦码头工人原来只拒绝为伦敦港中罢工已逾两月的两艘加拿大船卸货，但由于雇主们威胁工人如果他们不为一切船只卸货，即将予以解雇。这引起工人们的愤怒而扩大了罢工。伦敦港现已部分瘫痪，有一百艘船只因罢工而冻结。
