Tianjin China Bank
　　Focuses on Supporting Native Product Exports; Pilot Inter-port Import Advance

[Tianjin Daily News] To further support the export of native products, vigorously develop trade between urban and rural areas, and facilitate export manufacturers to directly purchase export goods from production areas, the Tianjin China Bank, with the approval of the Tianjin People's Bank, is preparing to launch inter-port import advance business between Tianjin and production areas in the coming days. Export manufacturers who intend to purchase native raw materials in production areas for export abroad and require working capital can apply for this loan from the bank. After the inter-port import advance is launched, export manufacturers can obtain financial support from the Bank of China throughout the entire business process, from purchasing native products in the production area to loading the goods for export. There will be inter-port import advance when purchasing native products, and after the goods are transported to Tianjin, they can be converted into raw goods mortgages. When goods are sold abroad and letters of credit are obtained, they can be converted into packing loans. When loading the goods for export, they can be converted into export advances, and all payments for the goods can be recovered. This type of loan is very helpful for developing export trade and facilitating the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in the future.

The preparatory work for handling inter-port import advance has been initially completed, and the relevant rules and procedures have been drafted by the Bank of China and approved by the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank. Currently, in order to gain preliminary experience for gradual promotion, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Jinan are tentatively designated as key pilot areas. The Tianjin China Bank is currently in contact with the People's Banks in the above-mentioned areas, and it will begin processing once the exchange of agreements with various locations is completed.

　　津中国银行
  　重点扶植土产出口　试办埠际进口押汇
    【天津日报讯】津市中国银行为进一步扶植土产出口，大力开展城乡贸易，便利出口厂商向产地直接采购出口物资，经津市人民银行批准，准备日内举办天津与产地间埠际进口押汇业务。凡经营出口厂商拟在产地收购土产原料运销国外而需要资金周转者，都可向该行申请该项贷款。埠际进口押汇举办后，出口厂商从在产地购买土产起直到货物装船出口，全部业务过程都可获得中国银行资金的扶助，在购土产时有埠际进口押汇，货物运津后，可转作生货押款，在国外将货售妥取得信用证，即可转作打包放款，装船出口时，可转作出口押汇，收回全部货款。这种贷款，对今后发展出口贸易，便利城乡物资交流，是很有帮助的。
    办理埠际进口押汇的准备工作现已初步完成，有关的规章手续业经中国银行拟定并经人民银行天津分行批准。目前为取得初步经验以便逐步推广计，暂定由张家口、石家庄、保定、济南四地作重点试办，现津市中国银行正与以上各地人民银行联系中，一俟各地协议书交换妥当后即可开始办理。
