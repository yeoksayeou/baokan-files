　　Vow to Avenge the Blood Debt!
  　Bandit Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Shanghai's Downtown Area
  　Causing Three to Four Hundred Resident Casualties
    [Report from this newspaper] According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Several Kuomintang bandit planes indiscriminately bombed Shanghai's downtown area at noon on the 29th of last month, dropping multiple heavy bombs in areas such as Zhabei, North Station, and Hongkou, causing significant losses to the lives and property of local people. According to preliminary statistics, over a thousand civilian houses were destroyed, and three to four hundred residents were injured or killed. Many of the destroyed houses were thatched huts, and children accounted for the majority of the casualties. The bandit planes' frantic bombing of the people of Shanghai aroused boundless anger among the broad masses of the people. This reporter witnessed many family members of the victims weeping over the bodies while angrily cursing the Kuomintang bandit gang. The wife of Fu Caihong, a resident who had just been rescued from the rubble, held her injured head and repeatedly and furiously cursed, "Damn Chiang!" She shouted, "We must avenge ourselves quickly!" A worker from the China Textile Company said through gritted teeth, "Quickly help the People's Liberation Army to fight to Guangzhou and Taiwan, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and avenge this blood debt!" During the bandit planes' air raid, rescue organizations such as the Municipal Garrison Headquarters, the Public Security Bureau Fire Brigade, and the Joint Relief Committee immediately mobilized to carry out emergency rescue work.
