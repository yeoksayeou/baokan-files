Learning and Entertainment
(Random Thoughts on the Soviet Union - Part 5)
Mao Dun

In the view of the average Soviet person, the elements of daily life are: work, learning, and entertainment. They cannot imagine a normal person (i.e., someone who is neither sick, nor old, nor an idiot) being able to exist without working, or enjoying the fruits of others' labor without needing to work. They also cannot imagine a person working for several hours and not having entertainment (their definition of entertainment is also different from what the average person here considers entertainment), or subjectively wanting entertainment but objectively not being able to have it. Finally, they cannot imagine a person not needing to learn outside of work and entertainment, or not having the interest and possibility of learning.

They affirm the inseparability of work, learning, and entertainment. Why do they have this kind of awareness? Because their social system is like this: people must work, and after working, of course, they must have entertainment, and in addition to work and entertainment, there is learning. Soviet people who grew up under the Soviet system have developed the above-mentioned views on work, learning, and entertainment in real life.

Regarding the obligation and right of everyone to work – I will talk about this in another article; this article will only briefly describe learning and entertainment.

First, let's look at what kind of facilities the Soviet society has for people's entertainment and learning.

Suppose you arrive at a collective farm with only dozens of households and a hundred or so people, then you will naturally not find theaters, cinemas, or other entertainment facilities found in cities, but you can find a club set up by the collective farm, of course not large, just enough for the entire membership of the farm (a hundred or so people) to gather. In the auditorium of this club, movies, song and dance parties, and lectures are held several times a week. If you pay attention to the notices on the wall, you will also know that next week the amateur theater troupe from a nearby factory will come to perform plays at the invitation of the farm's management department; or the amateur song and dance troupe from a larger collective farm nearby will come to perform various local folk songs and dances. All these regular or temporary entertainment programs can be enjoyed unconditionally by the members of the collective farm.

The club must also have wall newspapers, published every other day, every three days, or weekly, one or two kinds. The content of the wall newspapers includes everything from national affairs to the production situation of the farm, literary essays, and cartoons. The writers of these wall newspapers include teachers from the farm's affiliated primary school or evening school, staff from the farm's management department, or the collective farmers themselves. There are inevitably some expenses for running the wall newspapers, and these are also paid by the farm's management department from public funds. The club also has a reading room, and the expenses are also borne by the farm's management department.

The club may also have some notices, such as the accountant of the farm's management department (male or female) voluntarily teaching accounting or a foreign language for several hours a week, the farm's technician or doctor voluntarily teaching technical knowledge or hygiene common sense, the farm's amateur singer voluntarily teaching singing, and the amateur small band voluntarily teaching playing.

These are all facilities provided to the collective farmers for learning.

What I have mentioned above is just a small farm of a hundred or so people; if it is a large farm of several hundred or one or two thousand people, then of course the scale of entertainment and learning facilities will also increase proportionally. Large farms have cinemas, small theaters, sports fields, amateur theater troupes, singing teams, and sports teams, as well as well-equipped evening schools, half-day schools, etc.

As it is with farms, so it is with factories and institutions (not to mention schools). The scale of entertainment and learning facilities in the "cultural palace" of a large factory is probably better than everything in a small city in other countries. This is a considerable expense, which is also borne by the factory management.

Generally speaking, in the Soviet Union, wherever there is work, there are entertainment and learning facilities. Merchant ships sailing domestically and internationally also have a club for the crew to enjoy. However, there are no such facilities on trains. But the employees on the train work one shift and rest one shift, and when they rest, they still have the opportunity for entertainment and learning; the railway employees' club (or cultural palace) is available at major stations; the scale of the Moscow railway employees' cultural center is probably something that railway employees in other countries have not yet seen, except for Soviet railway employees.

Since wherever there is work there is entertainment and learning, that is, everyone with a job has the opportunity to enjoy entertainment and learning. Everyone in the Soviet Union is employed, and the working hours are limited (generally eight hours, with six or seven hours for special industries), and entertainment and learning are also free, so everyone has the possibility of entertainment and learning. This is the root cause of the Soviet people's view of work, entertainment, and learning as a "trinity" in society.

However, the Soviet people still feel that the entertainment facilities cannot fully meet people's requirements. For example, drama cannot be as ubiquitous as movies, and opera and ballet in drama are even less common than spoken drama. Many medium-sized cities do not yet have opera and dance theaters, and many villages do not yet have professional spoken drama troupes performing regularly. Although there is probably a circus in small towns, there is still none in the countryside. There are more than a dozen spoken drama theaters in Moscow, with a total of about 15,000 to 16,000 seats each night, which means that 15,000 to 16,000 people can see spoken drama each night, which obviously cannot meet the requirements of the five million Moscow citizens, but spoken drama is still easier to perform. At least half of Moscow's 350-plus clubs (such as the Stalin Automobile Factory and the Cultural Palace of the Subway Employees, as well as the Railway Employees' Cultural Center mentioned above, which are among the largest) have amateur theater troupes performing spoken drama regularly, so it is not so difficult to see spoken drama; as for opera and ballet, it is different. The Moscow Grand Theater, with more than 2,000 seats, regularly stages operas and ballets. Naturally, it is not enough to meet the needs of the citizens. It is well known to every Muscovite that tickets to the "Grand Theater" are difficult to come by. So, there are also lines of people waiting to buy tickets in front of the theater. According to Soviet friends, most of the tickets for the "Grand Theater" are handed over to the trade union, which in turn distributes them to various factories and institutions, leaving only a few tickets, and those are only for the third and fourth floors, which are sold at the theater box office at 1 or 2 pm (the show starts at 7:30 pm). This is what people are waiting in line to buy. Judging from the fact that theater tickets are also distributed, it can be seen that the Soviet people regard entertainment as a right of people.

At the same time, the Soviet people also regard learning as equally indispensable as entertainment. The scope of this so-called learning is extremely wide, from advanced specialized knowledge and technology to common sense in daily life. There is a Chinese idiom, "Live and learn," and the "learn" here is also extremely broad in scope. I think the "learn" in our idiom is the same as the so-called "learning" of the Soviet people, and its meaning is the same.

From the Soviet people's attitude towards learning and the universality of learning opportunities, one can know their spirit of constant self-improvement; and one can also know that their consciousness of the "trinity" of work, learning, and entertainment arises on the one hand because everyone lives a life of warmth and security, so they have the possibility of engaging in learning and entertainment, and on the other hand because their lives are healthy, their thoughts are upward, their spirits are flourishing, and their spiritual state is fundamentally different from the pursuit of sensual stimulation and indulgence in wine, sex, and fame in capitalist society.

　　学习和娱乐
    （杂谈苏联之五）
    茅盾
    在一般苏联人看来，日常生活的要素，便是：工作，学习，娱乐。他们不能想象一个正常的人（即此人既无疾病，亦未衰老，更不是白痴），可以没有工作，或毋须工作而坐享他人劳作之成果。他们也不能想象一个人既工作了数小时而可以没有娱乐（他们所谓娱乐也和我们这里一般人所谓娱乐不同），或主观上虽欲娱乐而客观上无此可能。最后，他们也不能想象一个人在工作和娱乐之外就不需要学习，或没有学习的兴趣与可能。
    他们肯定了工作、学习、娱乐—三者的不可分离性。为什么他们会有这样的意识呢？因为他们的社会制度就是这样的：人不可不工作，而工作后当然得娱乐，并且在工作娱乐之外更有学习。苏维埃制度下面长成的苏联人在现实生活中养成了如上所述的对于工作、学习和娱乐的看法。
    关于人人有工作之义务及权利——这一点，我在别篇中还要讲到；本篇只略述学习和娱乐。
    先看苏联社会有怎样的供人娱乐和学习的设备。
    假定你到了一个仅有数十户，百来人口的集体农场，那么，你自然找不到戏院、电影院或都市中所有的其他娱乐设备，然而你可以找到该集体农场所设的一个俱乐部，当然不大，恰够该农场全体成员（百来人）的集会。在这俱乐部的大会堂中，电影，歌舞会，讲演会，一星期内总举行几次。如果你留心看看墙上的布告，你又知道下星期有附近某工厂的业余剧团应本农场经理部之邀请，来演话剧；或者是附近某较大的集体农场的业余歌舞团要来表演多种土风歌舞。所有这一切经常的或临时的娱乐节目，该集体农场的成员都可以无条件享受。
    俱乐部中一定还贴有壁报，隔日刊，三日刊或周刊，一种或两三种。壁报的内容，自国家大事以至该农场的生产情形，文艺小品，漫画，应有尽有。这些壁报的撰写人，有农场附设的小学或补习夜校的教员，农场经理部的职员，或者集体农民自己。为了办壁报，不免有些费用，这也是农场的经理部由公帐上开支的。俱乐部中又有书报室，开支也由农场经理部担负。
    俱乐部中也许还有些布告，例如农场经理部的会计员他（或她）义务教授会计或一种外国文，每周几小时，农场的技术师或医生义务教授技术知识或卫生常识，农场的某业余歌唱家义务教唱，业余的小乐队义务教授弹奏。
    这些，都是供给集体农民的学习的设备。
    上面所讲的，只是百来人的一个小农场；如果是数百或一二千人的大农场，那当然娱乐和学习的设备规模也比例地增大了。大农场有电影院，小剧场，运动场，有业余的各种剧团，歌咏队，球队，也有规模完备的补习夜校，半日校等等。
    农场如此，工厂和机关当然也是如此（学校更不用说）。大工厂的“文化宫”，其娱乐学习设备之规模，恐怕要胜过其他国家的一个小城里一切的所有。这是一笔不小的开支，也由工厂经理处担负的。
    一般说来，在苏联，凡是有工作的地方就有娱乐和学习的设备。行驶国内外的商船内也有个俱乐部，供给船员们享用。不过火车上没有这种设备。但是火车上的员工是工作一班休息一班的，休息时他仍有娱乐学习的机会；铁路员工的俱乐部（或文化宫）在各大站上都有；莫斯科的铁路员工文化馆那规模之大，恐怕是除了苏联铁路员工之外，别个国家里的铁路员工都还没有的。
    既然凡有工作的地方就有娱乐和学习，就是凡有职业的人都有享受娱乐和学习的机会。苏联人人都就业，而工作时间又有限定（普遍八小时，特种工业有六小时或七小时者），娱乐和学习也不取费，因而亦即人人有娱乐学习的可能。这就是苏联人把工作、娱乐、学习看成“三位一体”的社会的根因。
    但是，苏联人仍然感到娱乐的设备还不能尽量满足人们的要求。例如戏剧，不能象电影那样到处都有，而戏剧中的歌剧和舞剧更又不能象话剧那样普遍。许多中等城市里也还没有歌舞戏院，许多乡村里也还没有职业的话剧团作经常的演出。虽然小城内大概都有马戏院，然而乡村中也还没有。莫斯科有话剧院十多个，每夜一场，总计座位约一万五六千，就是每夜可有一万五六千人可以看到话剧，这显然不能满足五百万莫斯科市民的要求，但话剧究竟较易演出，莫斯科的三百五十多处俱乐部（例如斯大林汽车工厂及地下铁道员工的文化宫，以及上面讲到过的铁路员工文化馆等，都是其中最大的），至少有一半是有业余剧团在经常上演话剧，所以要看话剧还不是怎样困难；至于歌剧和舞剧那就不同了，经常上演歌剧和舞剧的，就是莫斯科大戏院，两千多座位，要满足市民的要求，自然太不够。“大戏院”的戏票难得，这是每一莫斯科人都知道的。于是在戏院门前，也就出现了排队买戏票的人列。据苏联朋友说，“大戏院”的票子大部分交给职工会，由职工会转而分配给各厂各机关，剩下不多的而且是三楼四楼的票子这才在戏院票房于下午一二时发售（戏在晚七时半开演）。这就是人们排队在买的。从戏票也分配这一点看来，可知苏联人把娱乐也视为人的一种权利。
    同时，苏联人又把学习看作和娱乐同样不可缺少的。此所谓学习，范围极宽，从高深专门的学问技术直到生活日用常识。中国人有句成语，“做到老，学到老”，这里的“学”也是范围极广的，我觉得我们这句成语中的“学”字正和苏联人的所谓“学习”，其意义是相同的。
    从苏联人这种对于学习的态度以及学习机会之普遍，就可以知道他们那种时时求进步的自强不息的精神；更可以知道他们那种工作、学习、娱乐“三位一体”的意识之产生一方是由于人人过着温饱的生活，故有从事学习与娱乐之可能，另一方面是他们的生活健康，思想向上，精神发皇，和资本主义社会中的追求肉感刺戟，沉缅于酒色利禄的精神状态是根本不同的。　（完）
