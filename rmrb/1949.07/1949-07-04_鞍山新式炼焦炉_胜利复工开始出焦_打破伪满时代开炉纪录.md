Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd. Anshan Iron and Steel Company's first Otto-type coking oven produced its first batch of coke on June 13th. This is the first new-style coking oven to officially resume production since the liberation of Northeast China. The coke production started 18 days ahead of the original plan. The output exceeded the plan by 9% in the first two days, and exceeded it by 60% on the third day. The quality is extremely good. The first batch of coke contained only 12.79% ash. This not only broke the opening furnace record of the puppet Manchukuo era but also approached the highest level of coke quality (12.05% ash content) during the normal production of the puppet Manchukuo. The successful operation of the coking oven will enable a blast furnace, which has already been completed, to be put into operation one month ahead of schedule, continuously supplying pig iron to steelmaking, machine manufacturing and other departments, to be made into steel materials and machines urgently needed for the construction and repair of industry and transportation in Northeast China. At the same time, with the operation of the coking oven, the by-product plant can also be put into operation to produce benzene (a chemical raw material for manufacturing solvents, dyes, and fuels), power benzene, sulfuric acid, solvent oil, coal tar, asphalt and other important chemical raw materials to supply the needs of the pharmaceutical, dye, rubber and other light industrial sectors. Before the start of coking, the plant carried out substantial preparatory work. In addition to completing the construction of equipment, it also conducted technical training, such as setting up technical training classes to enable workers to understand the principle that the temperature cannot rise too quickly when starting the furnace, thus completely avoiding the phenomenon of furnace wall cracking. Before starting work, the administration also organized all the old workers to study the opening furnace operation plan, ensuring the smooth and safe opening of the furnace and avoiding the furnace body explosion incidents that had occurred several times in the puppet Manchukuo era due to careless furnace opening.

　　鞍山新式炼焦炉
  　胜利复工开始出焦
  　打破伪满时代开炉纪录
    【新华社沈阳二日电】鞍山钢铁公司第一座奥托式炼焦炉，已于六月十三日第一炉出焦炭。这是东北解放以来第一个新式炼焦炉的正式复工生产。出焦时间较原计划提前十八天，产量在头两天超过计划百分之九，第三天超过百分之六十。质量极好，第一炉焦炭仅含灰分百分之十二点七九，不但打破了伪满时代历次开炉纪录，并接近了伪满正常生产时焦炭质量的最高水平（含灰分百分之十二点零五）。炼焦炉的胜利开工，将使早已修竣的一座高炉提前一月开炉，源源不断地把生铁供给炼钢、机器制造等部门，以制成为建设和修复东北工业、交通所急需的钢料与机器。同时，由于炼焦炉开工，副产厂也可随之开工出产苯。（为制造溶剂、染料及燃料的一种化学原料）、动力苯、硫酸＠①、溶剂油及煤焦油、沥青等重要化学原料，以供应制药、染料、橡胶等轻工业部门需要。炼焦开始以前，该厂曾进行了相当充分的准备工作，除完成设备的修建外，还进行了技术的教育，如成立了技术训练班，使工人懂得了开始炼炉时温度不能上升太快的道理，因而完全避免了炉墙破裂现象。开工前，行政上又组织全体老工友学习开炉作业计划，保证了开炉的顺利与安全，避免了伪满时曾数次发生的因开炉不慎引起炉体爆炸事件。
