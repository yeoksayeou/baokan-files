　　Tianjin Municipal Machine Flour Mill
  　Nearly 200,000 Bags of Flour Produced Last Month
  　More Than Double the Pre-Liberation Output
    [This newspaper reports] Under the vigorous support and correct guidance of the government, the output of the Tianjin Municipal machine flour industry has been increasing month by month. In June, the output of 18 flour mills reached 198,261 bags, with an average of 11,014 bags per mill, exceeding the average monthly output level during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang last year by more than 100% (according to last year's total production of 1,002,265 bags by 16 flour mills, the average monthly output was 83,522 bags, with each mill averaging 5,220 bags per month). Fifteen of the eighteen flour mills are processing for trade companies. Of the more than 190,000 bags of products, 76,489 bags were manufactured through processing, accounting for 40% of the output. The Tianjin Municipal flour industry has begun normal production, and the output has exceeded the standards of the Kuomintang period, but it is still far from the maximum monthly production of 400,000 bags by 86 grinding machines in 19 flour mills. All factories still have plenty of room for development. (Ming)

　　平市机器面粉厂
  　上月产面粉近廿万袋
  　超过解放前一倍
    【本报讯】平市机器面粉业在政府大力扶植和正确指导下，产量逐月增加，至六月份，十八家面粉厂产量已达十九万八千二百六十一袋，平均每家生产一万一千零十四袋，超过去年国民党反动统治时期月产量平均水平的百分之一百强（按去年全年十六家面粉厂共生产一百万零二千二百六十五袋，平均每月八万三千五百二十二袋，每家每月平均五千二百二十袋）。十八家面粉厂中有十五家给贸易公司加工。在十九万余袋产品中，有七万六千四百八十九袋系加工制造，占产量百分之四十。平市面粉业已开始正常生产，产量已超过国民党时期水准，但距离十九家面粉厂八十六部机磨每月最高生产量四十万袋尚远。各厂仍有充分发展的余地。（鸣）
