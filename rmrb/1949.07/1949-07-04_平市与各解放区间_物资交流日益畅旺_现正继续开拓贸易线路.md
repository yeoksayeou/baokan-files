    [This newspaper dispatch] Under the development and leadership of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the Trade Corporation, and the Cooperative Headquarters, trade between Ping City and various parts of North China, as well as neighboring regions in the Northeast and Northwest, is becoming increasingly prosperous. At the beginning of the liberation of Beiping, the Ping City Trade Corporation transported a large amount of grain into the city. By the end of June, it had supplied more than 120 million catties of grain to Ping City, ensuring a sufficient supply of grain for the city. In April, the company began to support private industries in Beiping through methods such as "exchanging yarn for cloth," "processing," and "purchasing finished products," in order to increase the supply of industrial products to the countryside and promote and accelerate the circulation of goods between urban and rural areas. Currently, more than 700 dyeing, weaving, knitting, machine milling, carpet, and other businesses are engaged in production with the support of the Trade Corporation and have achieved significant results. For example, the Huaxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory, supplied with yarn and cloth by the Trade Corporation for dyeing and processing, produced 8,100 bolts of dyed cloth in May, exceeding the total annual output of 6,551 bolts in the previous year. Other industries have also seen great improvement. By mid-May, the Trade Corporation, cooperatives, and others paid more attention to developing trade routes from all aspects. The Municipal Cooperative established a grain and cargo depot on May 10th and an office in the Farmers' Hostel on May 20th, specializing in handling the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and acting as a consignment agent. Currently, these depots have established trade relations with the Industrial Bureaus and Cooperatives of the Bohai Region, Shandong, Chahar, Central Hebei, Jilin, Eastern Hebei, Southern Hebei, and areas along the PingSui Railway. By the end of June, according to extremely incomplete statistics, the amount of grain transported from the above-mentioned regions reached 2 million catties, and flour exceeded 17,000 bags. There were also many mountain products such as almonds and medicinal materials, as well as raw silk, pig bristles, eggs, reed mats, and furs. The goods exchanged were mostly knitwear, yarn, cloth, fertilizer and other necessities for farmers. On May 19th, the Trade Corporation, in collaboration with two private business representatives, formed a survey team to go to the Northeast to investigate grain sources, transportation conditions, and promote the sale of industrial products from the city. After their return, the number of private businesses going to the Northeast to purchase and sell goods gradually increased. By June 18th, there were 434 businesses purchasing grain and selling rubber products and cloth produced in Beiping. At the beginning of June, the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company purchased 500 tons of iron from the Anshan Iron and Steel Works in the Northeast to meet the needs of Pingjin's industry, and will continue to purchase and transport iron. The Industrial Exhibition held in Beiping in June opened up broader possibilities for trade between Beiping and various liberated areas. During the Industrial Exhibition, the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government invited business communities from various regions to visit Beiping. Delegation from the Northeast, Northwest, Shandong, Eastern Hebei, Hebei-Luyu, Taiyue, Chahar, Central Hebei, and Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou and other places arrived successively. The delegations visited the Industrial Exhibition and factories, and held multiple discussion meetings. Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Mayor Ye Jianying of the People's Government, and industrial and commercial departments held various specialized meetings to exchange information and experiences. The Ping City Trade Corporation also completed the first batch of transactions with various regions. Various regions ordered 12,800 bolts of cotton cloth and large quantities of soap, matches, socks, etc. from Ping City. More than 10 million catties of food supplied by the PingSui Railway line to Ping City have also been delivered. In order to more effectively plan and guide urban and rural trade, the Municipal People's Government has also established a Trade Guidance Office. According to statistics from the Ping City Tax Bureau, in June, there were 108 merchants going to areas along the Jinpu Railway and Jinghu-Hankou, 86 going to various counties in Eastern Hebei, 12 going to the Northwest, and 39 going to areas along the Pinghan Railway. In addition, 14 stores applied for import and export trade. In late June, the Beiping Municipal Trade Corporation, cooperatives, and the Trade Guidance Office are organizing private merchants to go to the Xuzhou-Bengbu area to purchase wheat, and jointly formed two material exchange groups to visit the Northeast and Northwest and further discuss material exchange matters between the two regions. The work is progressing very smoothly, and more prosperous trade between the two regions can be expected. (Tian)
