Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th. The Anshan City Federation of Trade Unions is actively organizing collective welfare undertakings for employees. The city's employee labor insurance work has begun to take shape in the past six months. The city currently has one general employee hospital with 300 beds, two branch hospitals, seven health clinics, and one clinic, with 42 first-aid stations. Three collective employee dormitories have been established, along with 21 employee dining halls and 16 employee cooperatives. In addition, bathhouses have been opened in workers' residential areas, and contracts have been signed with private barbershops to provide preferential haircuts for employees. Furthermore, collective employee weddings have been organized, saving employees expenses. In the past, the trade union did not pay enough attention to factory hygiene and employee healthcare facilities, so labor insurance work was mostly post-event relief. In June, the focus shifted to preventative measures, which have already achieved significant results. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has universally installed hot water kettles to prevent employees from getting sick from drinking cold water. The company has 570 hot water kettles, and each person drinks an average of one qian (approx. 5 grams) of mung beans boiled into mung bean soup every day. According to a survey by the company's mechanical repair trade union, employee illnesses have significantly decreased since universally drinking mung bean water. The company has also established 77 bathhouses, organizing employees to take turns bathing. Some departments that easily affect workers' health, such as the crushing team at the refractory materials factory, still inevitably inhale dust into their respiratory organs despite wearing masks. After the labor insurance department of the Federation of Trade Unions and the factory workers studied the problem, they built enclosures around the machines with wooden boards to prevent dust from flying outwards; they also made chimneys out of iron sheets to extract the dust, thus reducing the amount of dust flying in the workshop by 70 percent.

　　设医院，建食堂，添浴池
  　鞍山增进职工福利
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】鞍山市职工总会积极举办职工集体福利事业。该市职工劳动保险工作，半年来，已初具规范。全市现有职工总医院一所，有床位三百个；分院两处，卫生所七个，诊疗所一所，并分设有急救科四十二处。职工集体宿舍已建立三处，职工食堂共二十一处，职工合作社已设立十六处。另在工人住宅区开设了浴池，与私人理发铺订立合同，优待理发职工。此外，又举办了职工集团结婚，节省了职工的开支。过去职工会对工厂的卫生与职工保健设施注意不够，因而劳动保险工作多半是事后救济，六月份即着重事前保护，现已获得显著成绩。如鞍山钢铁公司为了防止职工喝凉水得病，已普遍设置了开水壶。全公司有开水壶五百七十个，每人每天平均有一钱绿豆熬绿豆汤喝。据该公司机械修理工会的调查，普遍喝绿豆水后，职工的疾病已显著减少。全公司又成立了七十七处浴池，组织职工轮流洗澡。有些容易影响工人身体健康的部门，如耐火材料厂粉碎班，虽带口罩仍难免粉灰吸入呼吸器官，经职工总会劳动保险部与该厂工人研究后，在机器外边用木板作成围子，阻止粉灰向外飞散；另用铁板做成烟筒，将粉灰抽出去，这样即减少场房飞散粉灰的百分之七十。
