[Reported by this Newspaper] As our army reports frequent victories on the front lines, the Fourth Field Army's Southern Work Group has been ordered to go south. Since the 25th, they have been departing in batches. In recent days, all members and cadres of the group have been enthusiastic and excited, actively carrying out various preparations before going south and during the march.

After a month of study, the vast majority of the 10,000 youths from Beiping and Tianjin who joined the Southern Work Group have clarified the various unclear motives they had when they first joined, initially established the determination to serve the people, and increased their understanding of the revolution and going south. Several preparations for the march, combined with learning discussions, have also cleared up some of the students' concerns about going south.

After this march mobilization order was issued, the students mostly regarded it as a good opportunity to dedicate themselves to the revolution, practically test and train themselves. The warm send-off rally by people from all walks of life in Ping City, the earnest exhortations of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Comrade Peng Zhen, and Comrade Ye Jianying, and the resolute calls of the responsible comrades of the Southern Work Group's various subgroups, further encouraged and gladdened the students. Each company and squad discussed and formulated march plans and agreements to ensure the maintenance of the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army. Challenge and re-challenge waves were launched on the walls and express reports of each company. The Third Subgroup launched a red flag competition for the model train of the march. Many Youth League members took the lead in formulating plans during this mobilization and guaranteed to strive to be model League members in the march. Many non-League member students expressed their desire to strive to join the League during this march. Many squads also formed mutual aid groups, making full preparations based on their actual situations and the difficulties they envisioned.

Many family members who initially blocked their children from joining the group are now mostly coming to see them off as they go south, demonstrating the increased level of people's awareness after the liberation of Beiping. Youth organizations and students from various schools in Beiping City have successively sent more than 3,000 letters of encouragement to the students of the Southern Work Group and more than 300 letters of comfort to the families, expressing the warm expectations and heartfelt admiration of Beiping youth and students for the students of the Southern Work Group.

At the same time, the administrative cadres checked the borrowed civilian houses before the march, compensated for all damaged items at the price, paid special attention to the marching hygiene of the students, purchased a large number of medical supplies, specially prepared medical trains for each train, and properly arranged for the students who were ill.

　　纷定行军计划展开竞赛挑战
  　南工团整装待发
    平市青年寄信三千封倾诉热望
  　许多家属欢欣勉励子弟南下
    【本报讯】正当我军前方捷报频传之时，四野南下工作团奉命南下，自二十五日起分批出发，连日来全团学员干部，情绪热烈兴奋，积极进行南下前和行军途中各种准备工作。
    平津青年一万人参加南工团后，经三月来学习，绝大部分廓清了初参加时模糊不清的各式各样的入团动机，初步树立了为人民服务的决心，提高了对革命和南下的认识。几次的行军准备，结合学习的讨论，又扫清了同学对于南下的某些顾虑。
    此次行军动员令下以后，同学多认为是献身革命、实际考验和锻炼自己的好机会，平市各界人民的热烈欢送大会，朱总司令、彭真同志、叶剑英同志的谆谆训勉，南工团各分团负责同志的坚决号召，更使同学鼓舞欢欣，各中队小队纷纷讨论，订出行军的计划和公约，保证保持解放军的光荣传统。各中队墙报和快报上展开了挑战、应战再挑战的热潮，三分团并展开了行军模范列车的红旗竞赛。许多青年团员在这次动员中带头订立计划，并保证在行军的行动中争取当模范团员，许多非团员同学则表示要在此次行军中争取入团。许多小队又成立了互助组，各自根据实际情况和设想了可能遇到的困难，作了充分的准备。
    许多同学的家属最初在他们子弟入团时拦阻的，现在多来欢送他们子弟南下，表现了北平解放后人民觉悟程度的提高。北平市各青年团体、各学校同学，先后寄给南工团的同学鼓励的信三千余封，慰劳家属的信三百余封，表示了北平青年及同学对南工团学员的热烈期待和衷心的敬佩。
    同时行政干部方面在行军前检查了借用的民房，按价赔偿了所有损坏的物件，尤其注意学员的行军卫生，购买了大批医药用品，每列车特备医务列车，并妥善安置正在病中的学员。
