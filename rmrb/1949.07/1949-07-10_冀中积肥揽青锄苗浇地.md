　　Accumulates Fertilizer, Collects Green Manure, Hoes Seedlings, and Waters Land
    ▲ Ding County farmers are collecting green manure and accumulating fertilizer in every household, engaging in intensive cultivation and meticulous farming. Before the rain on June 25th, all 17,000 waterwheels and all the windlasses in the county were working non-stop, day and night. Men, women, old and young, were hoeing seedlings during the day and watering the land at night. Currently, all 710,000 mu of spring seedlings in the county have been hoed twice, and most of the cotton has been hoed three to five times, with all cotton aphids eliminated. Some villages have responded to the call from higher authorities and have begun to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer using wheat straw and green grass, etc. In many villages, the practice is to hoe the land during the day and deliver manure at night. Most of the spring corn is now tasseling, the cotton is over a foot tall, and the late crops have all sprouted in the ridges.
    ▲ The financial clearing work in the Tenth Special District of Jizhong after the Pingjin Campaign has concluded. A total of 500,000 jin of grain and over 190,000 jin of grass have been repaid to the overdrawn masses, as well as 3.37 million jin of rice (converted from livestock and non-staple food losses). The clearing work strengthened the relationship between the government and the masses, uncovered some chaotic financial practices, and eliminated or reduced the phenomenon of arbitrary apportionments at the village level, which had increased the burden on the people. A grassroots financial system was established, grain storage was strengthened, organizational discipline was tightened, individual embezzlers were punished, and many undeclared lands were discovered, greatly educating the cadres and the masses.
    ▲ In this spring's river management in the Ninth Special District, disaster victims were organized to contract for work as a form of relief, which solved the livelihood and seed difficulties for many disaster victims. The construction teams from Gaoyang, Li County, Suning, and Anping, totaling more than 3,200 people, earned a total of 223,860 jin of wages in rice.

　　冀中
  　积肥揽青锄苗浇地
    ▲定县农民家家揽青积肥，精耕细作。六月二十五日落雨前，全县一万七千辆水车及所有辘轳，昼夜不停。男女老少都是白天锄苗夜间浇地，现全县七十一万亩春苗已锄过二遍，棉花大部已锄三遍到五遍，棉花蚜虫已全部消灭。有些村庄已响应上级号召，开始用麦秸、青草莽等大量积肥，好多村庄都是白天锄地，黑夜送粪。现春玉米大部秀穗，棉花已一尺多高，晚田已都长出了垄。
    ▲冀中十专区平津战役后的财政清理工作已告结束。计偿还超支群众粮食五十万斤，草十九万余斤，偿还牲口副食品等损失折米共三百三十七万余斤。清偿中密切了政府与群众的关系，清查出财政上的一些紊乱现象，杜绝或减少了村级随便摊派加重人民负担的现象。建立下层财政制度，加强粮食保管，严整组织纪律，惩处个别贪污分子，并查出不少黑地，大大教育了干部群众。
    ▲九专区今年春季治河中，以工代赈组织灾民包工渡荒，解决了不少灾民的生活和种籽困难。高阳、蠡县、肃宁、安平的包工队共三千二百余人，即挣得工资米二十二万三千八百六十余斤。
