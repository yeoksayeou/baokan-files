Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: Reports from various sources indicate that from July 8th to 10th, US Treasury Secretary Snyder, Canadian Finance Minister Abbott, and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps held talks in London regarding the British dollar crisis. According to the British Information Service, "The meeting discussed the import and export trade between the sterling area and the dollar area, and analyzed the factors contributing to the growing imbalance." No agreement was reached on this major issue in the British economic crisis during the three-country talks. Snyder has flown to Brussels after the end of the negotiations. According to United Press, he will "return to London around the time of the closing of the Commonwealth Finance Ministers' Meeting to re-examine the situation."

During Snyder's stay in London, public opinion circulated about the disputes between the United States and Britain surrounding the British economic crisis. Regarding the British dollar crisis, Cripps believes that this is because "the United States has failed to fulfill its responsibility to import from Marshall Plan countries." Snyder retorted that this was because "British goods are sold at too high a price in the United States." On the issue of sterling devaluation, "Snyder is in favor of revaluing European currencies, including devaluing the pound, but Cripps firmly opposes any change in the exchange rate of the pound." Regarding the issue of halting purchases of American goods, American officials in London expressed great dissatisfaction with Cripps's order to halt purchases of American goods. United Press reported: "The order will first be implemented in British colonies, and the Commonwealth Finance Ministers' Meeting will extend the order to the entire British Empire." An American official in London said: "It is an economic iron curtain separating the sterling area and the dollar area."

　　英国经济危机日深
  　美英双方争吵不休
  　伦敦经济谈判毫无结果
    【新华社北平十二日电】各方报道：七月八日至十日，美财长斯奈德、加拿大财长亚伯特与英财相克利浦斯，曾在伦敦举行了关于英国美元危机问题的谈判。据英国新闻处称，“会议讨论了英镑区域与美元区域的进出口贸易问题，并分析了造成日益不平衡的因素。”对于这一英国经济危机中的主要问题，三国谈判未获协议。斯奈德已于谈判结束之后飞往比京布鲁塞尔，据合众社称，他将在“大英联邦财政部长会议闭幕前后返回伦敦，以重新检讨情况”。
    当斯奈德逗留伦敦期间，舆论上传出美英之间围绕着英国经济危机问题所发生的争吵。在英国的美元危机问题上，克利浦斯认为这是因为“美国未能履行它自马歇尔计划国家输入的责任”。而斯奈德则反驳说：这是因为“英国货物在美国出卖的价格太高。”在英镑贬值问题上，“斯奈德是赞成欧洲货币重订价值的，包括将英镑贬值在内，但是，克利浦斯却坚决反对英镑汇率的任何改变”。在停购美货问题上，伦敦美国官员对克利浦斯停购美货的命令甚表不满。合众社消息：“该命令首先在英国的殖民地实行，大英联邦财长会议将使该命令扩及整个大英帝国。”伦敦的一个美国官员说：“它是隔断英镑区域与美元区域的经济铁幕”。
