(Tangshan Dispatch) The Chinese Communist Party Working Committee stationed at the Qixin Cement Company in Tangshan convened a meeting at the beginning of this month with the plant's Trade Union Preparatory Committee and the Party Group of the Cooperative to summarize and review the work of the labor movement over the past six months. The meeting pointed out that, thanks to the correct leadership of the higher-level Party and the united efforts of the workers, difficulties have been overcome, and production has been gradually restored and developed, achieving considerable success. For example, the production of cement (bulk cement) has increased from 4,563 tons in January to 15,346 tons in June; the production of cement blocks (finished products) has increased from 5,978 tons in January to 11,880 tons in June, exceeding the plant's average monthly production of 11,000 tons in 1936. However, this is still far from the average monthly production of 18,020 tons of cement blocks in the first half of 1937 before the July 7th Incident (with a peak cement block production of 20,600 tons in April). In terms of workers' welfare, the establishment of a workers' cooperative has guaranteed workers' livelihoods. The abolition of the contractor system and the establishment of an examination system for apprentices to be promoted to skilled workers has eliminated some unreasonable systems. Other achievements include the negotiation and repair of bathhouses and barbershops, the organization of study sessions, and the initial improvement of workers' political awareness. However, there are still some shortcomings and deviations in the work: First, the policy of "developing production and benefiting both labor and capital" has not been thoroughly implemented. For example, members of the Trade Union Preparatory Committee and worker representatives have not seriously persuaded or corrected some workers who are late or leave early and are not actively involved in production; the organization of workers' welfare undertakings has wasted a lot of manpower and financial resources, which has seriously affected the development of production. For example, repairing a basketball court, which originally required 500 workers, took three months and consumed 1,919 man-days. Second, the work of the Trade Union Preparatory Committee lacks clear division of labor and thorough planning, adopting the "one size fits all" approach of rural work, and the work style is not democratic enough, with excessive intervention. For example, due to the lack of a mass line, the assessment by the Examination Committee failed twice, and the dismissal of the barber caused dissatisfaction among the workers. Worker education lacks overall planning, workers' awareness is not high, and they unilaterally make unreasonable welfare demands to the factory and fail to abide by labor discipline. Third, there are narrow departmental viewpoints among the worker representatives, some of whom regard themselves as heroes, engage in sectarianism, and fail to coordinate with each other in their work. Some comrades even bring the old administrative management style and the corrupt practices of the puppet trade unions to the Trade Union. The meeting analyzed that the main reasons for the above shortcomings are: (1) The Working Committee lacks experience in factory work, the use of the mass line is not sufficient, and the work is not detailed enough; (2) The members of the Trade Union Preparatory Committee and the worker representatives lack new working methods under the long-term rule and influence of the Kuomintang and bourgeois puppet trade unions; (3) The higher-level trade union has failed to help the lower-level unions formulate work plans in a timely manner and to check, supervise, and summarize work experience on time; (4) Some of the Party members in the Trade Union are old Party members, but they have lacked education in the past, and they have not thoroughly implemented the instructions of the Working Committee. In order to improve future work, the meeting decided to strengthen the leadership of the Party Groups of the Trade Union and the Cooperative, establish a meeting reporting system for the Party Groups, help the Party Groups plan, check, and summarize work on time, lead the Party Groups in learning, oppose sectarianism, and establish a formal Trade Union.

### 半年来产量逐渐提高两利方针贯彻尚不够　驻启新洋灰厂工委会总结工作

　　半年来产量逐渐提高两利方针贯彻尚不够
  　驻启新洋灰厂工委会总结工作
    【唐山电】驻唐山启新洋灰公司的中共工作委员会，于本月初召集该厂职工筹委会及合作社党组开会，总结检讨半年来的工运工作。会中指出：半年来在上级党的正确领导和职工群众的团结努力下，克服困难，逐步恢复发展生产，获得相当成绩。如洋灰（散灰）产量已由一月份的四千五百六十三吨，提高到一万五千三百四十六吨；灰块（成品）产量由一月份的五千九百七十八吨，提高到六月份的一万一千八百八十吨，超过了该厂三十六年度平均月产一万一千吨的产量，但较七七事变前民国二十六年前半年平均月产洋灰块一万八千零二十吨（其中四月份的最高灰块产量二万零六百吨）则相差很远。在职工福利事业方面：建立职工合作社，保障了职工生活；发动工人取消包工大柜，建立学徒提升技工的考工制，废除了一些不合理制度；其他如协商增修了澡堂、理发室，组织学习，初步提高了职工的政治认识等，也都获得一定的成绩。但是，工作中仍存在着一些缺点与偏向；一、对“发展生产，劳资两利”的政策，贯彻执行的不够。如职工筹委会委员和职工代表对某些迟到早退生产不积极的职工未作认真的说服与纠正；举办职工福利事业浪费大量人力与财力，以致严重影响了生产的发展；如修理一个篮球场，原需五百个工就可修好，竟费时三月，用去人工一千九百一十九个。二、职工筹委会的工作缺乏明确的分工与通盘周密的计划，采取“一把抓”的农村工作方式，工作作风不够民主，包办代替。如由于没有群众路线，考工委员会评定数两次失败，开除理发员引起职工群众的不满等。职工教育缺乏通盘计划，职工觉悟不高，片面地向厂方提出不合理的福利要求和不遵守劳动纪律等。三、职工代表中存在着狭隘的本位观点，有的以功臣自居，闹宗派主义，工作上互不协调，个别同志甚至把旧的行政管理作风和伪工会的腐败作风带到职工会里来。会议检讨产生以上缺点的主要根源是：（一）工委缺乏工厂工作经验，群众路线的运用不够充分，工作不够细致；（二）参加职工筹委会的委员及职工代表在国民党、资产阶级伪工会的长期统治影响下，缺乏新的工作办法；（三）上级工会未能按时帮助下级订出工作计划，并按时检查督促总结工作经验；（四）工会党员有的虽是老党员，但过去缺少教育，对工委指示贯彻执行的不够。为了改进今后的工作，会议决定加强对工会与合作社党组的领导，建立党组的会议汇报制度，按时帮助党组计划检查，总结工作，领导党组学习，反对宗派山头主义，建立正式职工会。
