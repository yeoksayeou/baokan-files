Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 17th: According to a Hong Kong dispatch published in the Guangming Daily on July 11th, the British authorities in Hong Kong are vigorously undermining the cultural and educational undertakings of local Chinese residents, depriving the Chinese people of their freedom to receive education. The Hong Kong British Government's Education Department has announced its intention to forcibly take over the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Laboring Children's School," which is run by Chinese laborers in Hong Kong and Kowloon, starting in September. On June 10th, the Education Department, together with the Fisheries Department, summoned representatives of the school boards of the Aberdeen, Cheung Chau, and other fishing schools, stating that in the future, the Education Department and the Fisheries Department would send personnel to participate in the school boards of the fishing schools founded by Chinese fishermen in Hong Kong, and appoint principals to preside over school affairs. All matters concerning the fishing schools' finances, organization, curriculum, and hiring of teachers would be handled by a new council under the control of the British authorities, attempting to take over the fishing schools in a disguised form. The Laboring Children's School has more than 2,000 students and was established and developed through the financial and physical contributions of all workers from more than 30 major industrial trade unions and workers' associations in Hong Kong, with donations and support from the general public, and through the cooperation of a group of young Chinese intellectuals. Upon learning of the British government's order to take over the Laboring Children's School, parents of students in various districts and workers from various trade unions held meetings and formed school protection committees. On June 16th, they unified to establish the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Laboring Children's School Protection Committee." Hong Kong University professors Ma Jian and Chen Junbao have also issued statements protesting this.
