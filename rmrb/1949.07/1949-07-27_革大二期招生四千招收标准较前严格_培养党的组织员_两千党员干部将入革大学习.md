　　Two Thousand Party Cadres to Study at Revolutionary University
　　[Reported by this newspaper] According to the comrade in charge of the Revolutionary University headquarters, after the graduation of the first class of students, the second class of students will be recruited in two parts: one part is 4,000 young intellectuals, and registration will begin on the 28th. The study period is still set at four months. The standards for this recruitment will be more stringent than the last time, requiring a certain level of education and political awareness. Those who are currently studying or employed must be certified by their schools or organizations. Those who are out of school or unemployed must be thoroughly investigated by the local government or responsible authorities (such as the North China People's Government, the Beiping Municipal People's Government), and provide a written certificate. The other part is 2,000 Party member cadres from various provinces and organs in North China, who will be transferred from various regions by the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The study period will be about one year, mainly to provide Party education in terms of ideology, organization, and working methods, to cultivate Party organizers. The Tianjin branch and a part of the Beiping city campus have been decided to be closed, and the second class of students will concentrate on studying at the Xiyuan campus.
