Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th – Reports indicate that the London dockworkers' strike in sympathy with the striking Canadian seamen has now entered a critical phase. On July 8th, the number of strikers surged to 10,220, immobilizing 112 ships. The British government's coercion to force the workers back to work proved ineffective. Consequently, on the 11th, the British monarch issued a decree to Parliament, declaring a state of "emergency" in Britain effective from the 11th, attempting to implement unrestricted suppression of the strikers. Under the "Emergency Powers" Act of 1920, after the monarch declares a state of "emergency," the government can deploy troops to take over the docks, arrest workers without warrants, search trade unions, and forcibly requisition civilians, housing, and vehicles to clear accumulated goods, etc. In British history, this law has only been invoked once before, during the suppression of the General Strike in 1926.

The London dockworkers responded to the government's frantic persecution measures with even more resolute struggle. On the 13th, the number of strikers soared to 13,964, immobilizing 132 ships, creating the first major strike in the history of the Port of London, with more than half of the dockworkers simultaneously ceasing work. Dockworkers are also scheduled to hold a demonstration on the 17th to protest the government's persecution. An increasing number of British workers have announced their support for the dockworkers' strike. Two thousand meat porters in Smithfield have decided not to handle meat unloaded from ships by the military. Nine hundred ferry workers in London have decided to refuse to ferry troops going to ships to unload goods. Truck drivers transporting meat between docks and wharves, as well as workers on London port's surface and tugboats, have also expressed the same determination. The 35,000 members of the French dockworkers' union have also refused to load or unload goods for British ships since the 12th.

    罢工斗争尖锐
    法码头工人拒绝装卸英轮货物
    【新华社北平十五日电】各方报导：伦敦码头工人因同情加拿大海员罢工而进行的罢工斗争，现已进入尖锐化阶段。罢工者于七月八日骤增至一万零二百二十人，冻结船只至一百一十二艘，英国政府胁迫工人复工无效，英王乃于十一日行文国会，宣布英国于十一日起处于“紧急状态”中，企图对罢工者实行无拘束的镇压。根据一九二○年的“紧急权力”法，在英王宣布“紧急状态”存在之后，政府可以出动军队接管各码头；可以无须拘票而随意拘捕工人，搜查工会；可以强迫征用民夫、民房、车辆、以清卸积存货物等。在英国历史上，仅一九二六年镇压全国总罢工时曾一度运用过这一法令。
    伦敦码头工人以更坚决的斗争来回答政府的这种疯狂的迫害措施，十三日，罢工者激增至一万三千九百六十四人，冻结船只增至一百三十二艘，造成了伦敦港口史上第一次半数以上码头工人同时停止工作的大罢工。码头工人并定于十七日举行抗议政府迫害的示威游行。愈来愈多的英国工人，已宣布支持码头工人的罢工。大司密斯非尔德的两千肉类搬运夫，已决定不搬运军队从船上卸下的肉类。伦敦的九百渡船工人，已决定拒绝为前往船上卸货的军队摆渡。在码头与船坞间运送肉类的卡车工人与伦敦港水面及拖船工人，也表示了同样的决心。法国码头工人工会所属之三万五千名码头工人，自十二日起亦已拒绝为英国船只装卸货物。
