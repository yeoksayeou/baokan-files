Inspiration from Workers
Cao Ming

Since Chairman Mao's speech at the Forum on Literature and Art, and after the study of rectifying the "three styles," literary and art workers have gone to the countryside, the military, and factories. I am one of them.

Several visits to state-owned enterprises have given me much inspiration, and I have learned a lot from the working masses. The working class's determination, courage, collectivist spirit, etc., although known in theory in the past, "Why?" and "What are the specific manifestations?" It was only after I went to the factory, from the qualities and strengths shown by the working class itself, from the production process, the changes in production relations, etc., that I gradually experienced some of them.

More than a month after the liberation, workers at the Huanggu Tun Railway Factory enthusiastically proposed to repair a "Beiping" locomotive to celebrate the liberation of Beiping. They not only worked enthusiastically but also promoted a enthusiastic production movement involving most of the workers. When reporters came to interview and wanted to praise everyone and those activists, the activists firmly urged them not to praise them. Song Guangfu and others said: "The locomotive was repaired by everyone, it is everyone's功劳 (gonglao, merit), and the masses should be praised. As for us, please don't mention it, otherwise people will say: In the end, it is just you few people showing off! Then, what we say won't be effective in the future." The simple and humble nature of the pioneers and their great spirit moved me greatly.

Let's look at the process of repairing a locomotive: the boiler part is naturally important, but disassembling the car, turning the wheel, sand casting, forging, and electrical work are equally indispensable. Workers understand this, so they deeply know the importance of other people's work, and they know the value of other people's labor. Their collectivist spirit has long been cultivated in the production process. In this way, I often think of the arrogance of intellectuals, their inability to see the hard work of others, and their individualistic heroism of wanting to stand out (also manifested as shortcomings in my thinking), which should be driven away.

However, this does not mean that workers do not love honor. On the contrary, workers love honor the most. They will use all their strength and indomitable determination to obtain honor. They are most full of heroic spirit, but not the kind of individual heroism that despises or attacks others to show off themselves, but a collective heroism that is good at uniting everyone and giving full play to great creativity.

They consciously and diligently work hard. If they are praised, they are naturally happy. But if they are ignored, they don't care, don't complain, and don't make trouble. For example, in production competitions, the winners are very happy, but not arrogant; the losers are very angry with themselves and turn this anger into the basis for further efforts in the future. They don't complain about the unfairness of the winners and judges like our intellectuals do, or find many objective reasons to cover up their failures.

In the process of invention and creation, those workers lead their fellow workers with lower skills to experiment again and again. When they succeed, those leaders say everyone's names. They not only don't want to bury their merits, but they are also afraid of neglecting them and thus reducing their confidence in future creations.

Their sympathy and class love are the greatest. Ping Xisan, a worker at the Second Branch of the Shenyang Machine Factory, lost his job several times during the Kuomintang era and suffered countless oppressions, but his family's life was saved by those workers who ate bran and soybean cakes. They said to him: "If we have a bite to eat, you will have a bite to eat." - Only the proletariat has this kind of great sympathy in the era of hunger and persecution.

There was also a worker at a small station whose family was in danger of being flooded due to a flash flood, but he finally stuck to his post, held the power switch, and ensured the safety of the train. But his wife and children had drowned. Driver Zhang Fulin risked the threat of the enemy to preserve the people's property, which are all good examples.

Among the workers, such facts exist so richly; this is by no means a phenomenon, let alone an accidental phenomenon, but exists as the essence of the entire class. Therefore, we can encounter it at any time in the workers' thoughts and behaviors. But if we want to understand it deeply, we need to live among them for a longer period of time in order to understand their thoughts, feelings, and demands more delicately; and what is important is to be influenced by their collectivist spirit, self-sacrificing spirit, simple and humble qualities, and indomitable and heroic spirit to overcome all difficulties. I am increasingly willing to live among the workers. Because they are transforming my individualistic thinking every day. The less my individualism, the lighter my spiritual burden, and the more pleasant I am. Their wisdom constantly inspires me in literary creation. When I rely closely on them, I feel that I am not so empty, and I am also a little smarter because of the inspiration of their wisdom. But I am just starting. I still need more and deeper training.

In the factory, not only can we learn the excellent qualities of the workers, but we can also get great inspiration in language. Some people think that learning the language of the masses is to write a few sentences in the local dialect or add a few allegorical sayings. In fact, this is a superficial understanding. When we learn the language of the workers, we should learn from what angle and from what position they look at problems, what they love, what they hate, what they hope for, and what they worry about. For example, Zhao Wentai, a riveter, wrote in "Engaging in Production":

The Liberation Army arrived in Shenyang, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and soldiers surrendered.
Tens of thousands of workers were freed from their chains, and their sad hearts were replaced with joy.
Workers, rest assured, the power of the country belongs to us.
Workers, cheer up, diligently increase production for the people.
Workers, don't worry, the in-kind wages are well set.
Workers, don't be lazy, focus on production.
For construction, support the front, capture old Chiang and be overjoyed.

Speaking of hardship, when we were in Shanghai in the past, sometimes we only ate one meal a day, or two meals were porridge, and we felt very bitter, but compared with the fact that farmers in northern China (especially in the Chahar and Rehe areas) had no clothes to wear in winter, people starved to death in Changchun, and the working people of Shenyang ate bran and wheat bran, isn't it already very comfortable?

When we understand the suffering of the workers and peasants, we know what they hope for and what they like. Otherwise, we cannot imagine why a railway worker would not rescue his wife and children in order to ensure the safe passage of the train. Why did the farmer dedicate his precious son to the war? (An old widow in Jilin had five sons and sent four sons to the front.)

However, to deeply understand the workers, we must be with them for a long time, and first of all, we must be familiar with their language. Their language is not only firm and correct in its position, but also rich in humor, rich in emotion, and also very beautiful. Let me just cite a few of the poems they wrote.

Panning for Gold - Cui Xibao, a fitter at the Xinxin Factory

Water has a source and trees have roots,
The government's master is the people.
The people's "labor money" are cadres,
They do things for the people.
Electing representatives is like panning for gold,
Look left and right, be careful,
Choosing a good person is as good as gold,
Choosing a good person depends on being serious.

Song of the Red Flag - Hong Xusheng, a riveter at the Huanggu Tun Railway Factory

Red flag, red flag, I ask you:
Whose color dyed you?
Why are you so beautiful,
Flying in the blue sky,
Bright and unparalleled!

Red flag, red flag, I tell you,
Please go to Guangzhou quickly,
The people of Guangzhou
Are eagerly waiting for you,
Please go immediately!

Red flag, red flag, I congratulate you,
I wish you a long life like heaven and earth,
May you be planted all over the world!
Humanity pays you a high tribute,
And never separate from you!

Although they often write typos and sometimes the sentence structure is not smooth, the clarity, conciseness, vividness, and power of their poems is enough for me to learn for a lifetime.

Generally speaking, their artistic level is at a naive and rough stage, and this is where they urgently need the help and guidance of literary and artistic workers. However, after the workers' political emancipation, they also demand emancipation in culture and art. They want to use poetry, drama, and fine arts to express their accusations against the past rulers, their joy after emancipation, their production enthusiasm, and their selfless work. They are not satisfied with action, they require literature and art to reflect their actions, and rely on this to encourage and improve them. Now, in factories where literary and art cadres have gone, wall newspapers, choirs, and troupes have naturally been established. In factories where no literary and art cadres have gone, the workers also set up wall newspapers and yangko teams themselves (sometimes led by trade union cadres). In the future, with the imminent victory of the whole country, the lives of the workers will be improved day by day, and their demands for culture and art will be even stronger. On behalf of the workers, I request all advanced literary and art workers to go to the factories more! Going to the factory, on the one hand, can improve the workers' artistic level, and on the other hand, we ourselves will definitely gain something in terms of ideological training, creative themes, and the source of language, and we will not lose money. If we want to earn a little more, go more often. In short, our gains are directly proportional to the depth of our integration with the workers.

### 工人给我的启示

　　工人给我的启示
    草明
    自从毛主席文艺座谈会讲话以后，又经过整顿三风的学习，文艺工作者们都纷纷到农村，部队和工厂中去。我也是其中的一个。
    几次到公营企业部门，工人群众给我许多启示，我从他们身上学习很多东西。工人阶级的坚决、勇敢、集体主义精神等，过去虽然理论上都知道；但是“为什么？”“具体表现的是什么？”那是我到工厂以后，从工人阶级本身所表现的品质和力量，从生产的过程，生产关系的变化等等才逐渐体验出来一些。
    皇姑屯铁路工厂工人在解放后一个多月，即有一批积极工人提议加修一部“北平号”机车以预祝北平的解放。他们不仅热情地工作，还推动了大部份工人卷进一个热烈的生产运动里。等到记者来采访，要表扬大家和那批积极分子的时候，积极分子们坚决叮嘱千万不要表扬他们。宋广福等说：“火车头是大家修出来的，是大家的功劳，应该表扬大伙。至于我们，千万不要提，不然人家说：归根到底是你们几个人出风头！那么，以后我们说话就不好使了。”先行者的质朴谦虚，和伟大的气魄很使我感动。
    再看看修一台火车头的过程吧：修锅炉部份的自然重要，但是装拆车、旋盘、翻砂、锻工、电气等也一样缺不得。工人懂得这个，因此他深知别人工作的重要，他们知道别人的劳动的可贵。他们集体主义的精神，在生产过程中早已养成。这样，我常会想到知识分子的自大，看不见别人的辛劳，希望自己出人头地的个人英雄主义等的缺点（同样也表现在我的思想上的缺点），应该把它撵走。
    不过这决不是说工人不爱荣誉，反过来说，工人是最爱荣誉的，他们会用一切力量和不屈不挠的决心去获取荣誉，他们最富于英雄气概，但不是轻视别人或者打击别人来显耀自己的那种个人英雄主义，而是善于团结大家，发挥伟大的创造力的集体英雄主义。
    他们自觉地埋头地干活，如果受到表扬时，自然高兴。但如果被忽略的话，也不计较，不发牢骚，不闹情绪。比方生产竞赛吧，胜利者们，很高兴，但不骄傲；落选的人们呢，很生自己的气，并且把这种生气化为以后再努力的基础。他们不象咱们知识分子那样去抱怨胜利者和评判者的不公；或找出许多客观原因掩盖自己的失败。
    在发明创造过程里，那些工人领着技术比自己低的工友来一同试验再试验，成功的时候，那些领头者把大伙的名字都说出来，不仅不愿埋没他们的功劳，还生怕疏忽了他们因而减低了他们以后创造的信心。
    他们的同情心和阶级友爱最大，沈阳机器第二分厂工人平锡三在国民党时代，几次失业，复受了无数压迫，但他一家子的性命，总算由那些吃糠皮和豆饼的工人们救活过来了。他们对他说：“我们吃一口你也有一口吃”。——在饥饿迫胁的时代里，只有无产阶级才有这种伟大的同情心。
    还有一个小站上的工友，因山洪突发，他家有被淹冲之虞，但他终于坚守岗位，把持电闸，保证了列车的安全。但他的妻儿已给淹死了。司机张福林冒着敌人的威胁保存了人民的物质，都是好例子。
    在工人群中，象这样的事实是那么丰富地存在着；这决不是现象，更不是偶然的现象，而是作为整个阶级的本质而存在的。因此我们能在工人的思想、行为中随时碰得到。但如果要深刻地了解的话，则需要更长期地生活在他们中间，才能更细腻地了解他们的思想、感情和要求；而重要的是受他们的集体主义精神，自我牺牲精神，质朴谦虚的品质，不屈不挠，克服万难的英雄气概所薰陶。我越过越愿意在工人中间生活。因为他们每天都在改造我的个人主义的思想。我的个人主义去一点，我的精神上的负担要轻一点，也随着更愉快一点。他们的智慧给我在文学的创造上以不断的启发。紧紧倚靠着他们的时候，会感到自己不至于那么空虚，也因他们的智慧的启示而聪明了一些。不过我正在开始。我还有待于更多更深刻的锻炼。
    在工厂里，不仅学习工人们优良的品质，即使在语言上也会得到很大的启发。有些人以为学习群众的语言就是写上几句地方话，或加上几句歇后语。其实这是皮毛的了解。我们学习工人的语言，应该是学习他说话时拿什么角度，什么立场去看问题，他们喜爱什么，憎恨什么，他们盼什么，愁什么。例如铆工赵文泰写的“搞生产”里道：
    解放军，到沈阳，蒋匪官兵投了降。
    十数万工都脱了锁，解去愁肠换喜阳。
    工友们，放宽心，国家权力属咱们。
    工友们，振精神，勤劳增产为人民。
    工友们，莫担忧，实物工资定的优。
    工友们，莫偷懒，一心一意搞生产。
    为建设，援前方，捉住老蒋喜洋洋。
    说到苦，过去咱们在上海时，有时一天只吃上一顿饭，或者两顿都是稀饭，便觉很苦，但是比起过去北方农民（特别察热一带）冬天的没衣穿，长春的饿死人，沈阳劳动人民的吃糠皮麦麸来，不就已经很舒服了么？
    当我们了解了工农的苦处，我们才知道他们盼什么，怎样才喜欢。不然，我们就无法想象一个铁路工人为什为了列车安全通过而不去抢救妻儿。农民为什么把他的宝贵的儿子献给了战争了。（吉林一位老寡妇五个儿子，把四个儿子送上前方。）
    然而深刻的了解工人，就必须较长期的和他们在一起，首先是熟习他们的语言。他们的语言，不仅立场坚定正确，而且富于风趣，富于感情，也很美丽。我随便举几首他们写的诗来看看。
    沙里淘金——新新工厂钳工崔锡宝
    水有源来树有根，
    政府的东家是人民。
    人民的“劳金”是干部，
    他为人民办事情。
    选举代表好比淘金，
    左看右看要细心，
    选出好人金不换，
    要选好人靠认真。
    红旗歌——皇姑屯铁路工厂铆工洪旭生
    红旗，红旗，我问你：
    你的颜色谁染的？
    怎么那样美丽，
    飘在碧蓝的天空中，
    鲜艳无比！
    红旗，红旗，我告诉你，
    请你快往广州去，
    广州的百姓们
    都热烈的盼望你，
    请你立刻就去！
    红旗，红旗，我庆祝你，
    祝你寿同天地，
    全世界插遍你！
    人类向你致崇高的敬礼，
    和你永不分离！
    他们虽然常写白字，有时句法不通，但是他们诗歌的明确、简炼、生动、有力；够我学一辈子。
    一般来说他们的艺术水平是停留在幼稚粗糙的阶段上，这是他们迫切需要文学艺术工作的帮助和携带的地方。但是，工人在政治翻身之后，他们在文化艺术上也要求翻身，他们对过去统治者的控诉，对翻身后的喜悦，生产的积极，工作的奋不顾身，要用诗歌、戏剧、美术来表现。他们不满足于行动，他们要求文学艺术来反映他们的行动，并赖此以鼓舞和提高他们。现在工厂里，有文艺干部去的工厂，自然成立了壁报、歌咏队、剧团等。没有文艺干部去的工厂，工人们也七手八脚地自己成立壁报和秧歌队（有时工会干部来领导）。今后全国胜利在即，工人的生活更一天比一天改善，他们对文化艺术的要求也将会更强烈的，我代表工人向全体先进的文学艺术工作者要求，请你们多多的到工厂去！到工厂去，一方面可以提高工人文艺水平，另方面我们自己不管在思想的锻炼上，在创作题材和语言的泉源上也一定有所得，不会赔本。如果我们想多赚一点的话，就多去，常去。总之，我们的收获，是与我们和工人结合的深度成正比的。
