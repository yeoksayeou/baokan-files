　　Pingyu Road Breaks Old Regulations, Increases Locomotive Traction Quota
　　[This Newspaper] In the past, operational regulations stipulated that locomotives had a fixed conversion quota (40 cars). If this quota was exceeded, operating personnel could refuse to drive. However, in cases of military transport or when extra cars were particularly necessary, disputes often arose with operating personnel. In order to increase the traction quota, the Tianjin Locomotive Depot of the Pingjin Railway Bureau conducted an over-quota train operation experiment between Tianjin and Fengtai in June using locomotive MK1-680. First, a standard was calculated theoretically, and then proven through actual operation. The results showed that after using ordinary Luan coal (30% lump, 70% fine) and a Type A inspection, the locomotive ran 12,398 kilometers; after a Type C inspection, it ran 1,757.11 kilometers. The calculated traction was 50.3 cars, exceeding the regulation (45 cars) by 5.13 cars, equivalent to 48.3 cars, exceeding the regulation (40 cars) by 8.3 cars. Based on these results, the Railway Bureau has decided to raise the absolute traction quota for MK locomotives between Pingyu to the equivalent of 45 cars, exceeding the original regulation (40) by 5 cars, starting from July 7th, at a speed of 50 kilometers per hour. Personnel have been dispatched to various stations to conduct on-site tests of locomotive coal consumption, and preliminary results have also been obtained, with passenger trains consuming 1.5 kilograms of coal per equivalent kilometer.
　　[Another News] The production and conservation movement in the Pingjin Railway has been widely launched in various units of the bureau. The Finance Department of the bureau has had volunteers working overtime since May 24th. As of June 30th, a total of 239 people had worked overtime 3,178 times, saving 4,595 jin of millet in overtime pay.

　　平榆路打破旧规定提高机车牵引定数
    【本报讯】过去运转规定，机车牵引有一定换算定数（四○辆），超过定数，行车人员可以拒绝开驶，但一遇军运及特别须多挂一些时，常与行车人员发生争执。平津铁路局天津机务段为提高牵引定数，于六月间曾用冖ㄎ一六八○号机车举行津丰间超定数列车运转试验，先由理论上计算好标准，再由实际运行上去证明，结果使用普通滦煤（三分块七分末）甲检后一二三九八公里，丙检后一七五七点一一公里，牵引辆数计算为五○点三辆，超出规定（四五辆）五点一三辆，换算四八点三。超出规定（四○辆）八点三辆。路局根据这次成绩，已决定自七月七日起，平榆间冖ㄎ机车按每小时五○速度，将绝对牵引定数提高至换算四十五辆，超出原规定（四○）五辆，派员分赴各站现场试验机车耗煤量，亦得到初步结果，旅客列车一换算公里耗煤一·五公斤。
    【又讯】平津路生产节约运动，在路局各单位已普遍展开，局内财务处自五月二十四日起即有人自愿的义务加班，截至六月三十日，共有二百三十九人加班三千一百七十八次，节约加班费小米四千五百九十五斤。
