    Large Quantities of Wheat Soon to be Transported to Beijing
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Beijing Wheat Purchasing Committee, based on a telegram from the Ping-Sui Railway Line Wheat Purchasing Group, learned that wheat production in the Datong area is extremely abundant. It has been decided to send personnel in two batches with funds to Datong to purchase wheat. The Grain Stores, Rice and Flour Dealers, and Mechanized Flour Milling Associations, together raised 10 million yuan (the first batch being 5 million yuan). The People's Bank approved a loan of 10 million yuan (to be lent in two installments, 5 million yuan each), making a total of 20 million yuan for procurement. The first batch of funds, 10 million yuan, was taken by one representative each from the Grain Stores, Rice and Flour Dealers, and Mechanized Flour Milling industries. They gathered at the Grain Stores Association at 7:00 PM yesterday (the 19th) and departed, first to Zhangjiakou and then to Datong to purchase wheat. The second batch will depart with funds on Friday (the 22nd). Large quantities of wheat will soon be transported here in a steady stream. (Cheng Jie)
