　　Departments and Units of the North China People's Government and the North China Bureau
　　Study Chairman Mao's "July 1st" Thesis
　　Hua University, Peking University, and Other Schools Seriously Study the Document
　　[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" was published on July 1st, departments of the North China People's Government, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and directly affiliated units immediately launched a wave of enthusiasm for studying this epoch-making historical document. The North China People's Government Study Committee issued an urgent instruction on "July 1st," requiring all sub-study committees to immediately prepare study materials and begin studying from "July 1st." On July 2nd, the Study Committee, according to the original groupings based on theoretical and educational levels, stipulated the study progress and methods. In addition to "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," the study content also included Chairman Mao's speech at the preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference. Group A was also assigned the People's Daily editorial of July 3rd: "Strive to Further Consolidate the North China Party," while manual laborers were given a simplified history of the CCP by a designated person. At the end of the study, each group must report the study situation to the Study Committee, and manual laborers will take a test. The learning enthusiasm of all groups is very high, and they unanimously believe that the publication of Chairman Mao's article has solved many of their confused ideas; some comrades sincerely asked: Where should the study of economic work begin? This shows that most comrades have deeply realized the importance of economic work in the future construction of the new China. In addition, it was also discovered during the study that it would be more helpful to combine the study of these two documents with the study of modern Chinese history and current international affairs.
　　The departments of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee have also been studying this document for several days. The Party Committee originally stipulated that "July 1st" to July 10th would be a special study period, hoping to strengthen the education of new party members and manual laborers by studying the history of the Party and how to be a Communist Party member. The study content is still mainly "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," plus Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's speeches at the preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference, the CPC Central Committee's "July 7th" slogans, and the People's Daily editorial "Strive to Further Consolidate the North China Party." Some branches also used the "Communist's Inaugural Statement" and Articles 8 and 9 of the Second Plenary Session as reference materials for study.
　　[Another Dispatch] All employees of the North China Postal Administration began studying this important document on the morning of "July 1st."
　　[Another Dispatch] Students at Hua University and Peking University are also enthusiastically studying "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." In the first department of Hua University, students gathered in groups under the shade of trees to read the document on the day it was published. The main campus has officially arranged the article as study material, and each district team has put forward key points for discussion, mainly focusing on "the issue of internationalism," "democracy for whom," "dictatorship against whom," "who leads whom," "leaning to one side," and "examining thoughts."
　　After reading Chairman Mao's thesis, Peking University students began to discuss it. Wang Xuezhen, chairman of the student union, said: "Chairman Mao instructed us that internationally, we should firmly stand in the revolutionary camp headed by the Soviet Union, and domestically, we should implement a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Chairman Mao's conclusion comes from struggle."
　　The Liberal Arts Branch of the Peking University General Branch of the Communist Party of China discussed Chairman Mao's document on the 4th, and invited three professors, Tang Lan, Luo Changpei, and Rong Zhaozu, and non-Party students to participate. The discussion lasted for four hours, clarifying many ideological problems for party members, professors, and students. The Science Department and the Medical and Agricultural College branch in Sand Beach conducted discussions on the 5th, with more than 60 non-Party students attending, more than double the number of Party members. When they discussed construction, they linked it to studying technology well at school and exercising class viewpoints, so that they can contribute to construction in the future. Everyone unanimously realized that the most important thing is the issue of position. As long as the position is firmly established, other problems can be solved.

　　华北人民政府华北局各部门各单位
  　学习毛主席七一论文
    华大北大等校认真钻研文件
    【本报特讯】毛主席所著“论人民民主专政”在七月一日发表后，华北人民政府、中共中央华北局各部门及直属各单位立即掀起了对这一划时代的历史文献的学习热潮。华北人民政府学习委员会于“七一”即发出紧急指示，要各分学委会立即准备学习材料，自“七一”起便开始学习。七月二日，学委会又按照原来根据理论和文化程度所划小组，规定学习进度和学习方法。学习内容，除“论人民民主专政”外，再配合上毛主席在新政协筹备会上的讲话。甲组则增学人民日报七月三日社论：“为进一步巩固华北党而奋斗”，勤杂人员则由专人讲解中共简史。各组于学习终了时，须向学委会汇报学习情况，勤杂人员并将举行一次测验。各组学习情绪都很热烈，一致认为毛主席的这篇文章发表后，解决了自己许多糊涂观念；有的同志并城恳地提出：学习经济工作究应从何处开始？这表明大多数同志已深切地认识到经济工作在今后新中国建设中的重要性。另外在学习中，还发现学习这两个文件时，配合上中国近百年史和国际时事的学习是更有助益的。
    中共中央华北局各部门展开对这一文件的学习，也已有数日。党委会原来就规定“七一”到七月十日为一特别学习时期，希望从学习党的历史和怎样作一个共产党员，来加强对新党员和勤杂人员的教育。学习内容仍以“论人民民主专政”为主，再加上毛主席和朱总司令在新政协筹备会上的讲话，中共中央纪念“七七”口号和人民日报社论“为进一步巩固华北党而奋斗”。有的支部还以“共产党人发刊词”、二中全会中的八、九两条作为学习的参材考料。
    【又讯】华北邮政总局全体职工在“七一”上午就开始了对这一重要文件的学习。
    【又讯】华大及北大同学也在热烈学习“论人民民主专政”。华大一部，在文件发表的当天，同学们便一堆堆地围坐在树荫下阅读。校本部已将该文正式布置作为学习材料，各区队分别提出讨论重点，主要围绕“国际主义问题”，“对谁民主”，“对谁专政”，“谁领导谁”，“一边倒”，“检查思想”等进行讨论。
    北大学生看了毛主席的论文，便纷纷的讨论起来，学生会主席王学珍说：“毛主席指示我们，在国际上我们应坚决站在以苏联为首的革命阵营，在国内要实行工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。毛主席这个结论是从斗争中得来的。”
    中共北大总支部文法分支部在四号讨论毛主席的文件，并邀请了唐兰、罗常培、容肇祖三教授和非党员同学参加，讨论长达四小时，澄清了党员、教授和同学很多思想上的问题。理学院和沙滩医、农学院分支于五日进行讨论，到会的非党员同学六十余人，超过党员一倍。他们讨论到建设时就联系到在校要好好学习技术，锻炼阶级观点，以便将来能为建设发挥一份力量。大家一致认识到最主要的是立场问题，只要把立场站稳了，就能够解决旁的问题了。
