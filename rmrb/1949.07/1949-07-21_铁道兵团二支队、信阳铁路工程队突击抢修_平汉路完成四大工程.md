　　[Reported by This Newspaper] The Railway Engineering Corps 2nd Detachment and the Xinyang Railway Engineering Team have completed four major projects south of the Yellow River on the Pinghan Railway. The Railway Engineering Corps 2nd Detachment, with a spirit of rushing, completed the 476-meter-long Changtaiguan Bridge on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway in fifteen days, creating an unprecedented bridge-building record. The Changtaiguan Bridge was destroyed by the White bandit Chongxi on April 1st. After the 2nd Detachment connected the route bridges between Yancheng and Zhumadian, they began to build the bridge on June 10th. The soldiers worked day and night, highly displaying their heroic qualities. In the past, only two rows of trestle frames were erected each day, but this time they erected eight to ten rows a day. Nearby farmers actively supported this project, with more than a thousand farmers participating every day. The bridge was finally completed on the 27th, five days ahead of the original plan. The Xinyang Railway Engineering Team successively completed the Wushengguan Tunnel and the 1668 and 112 railway bridges. The Wushengguan Tunnel is 298 meters long and is one of the major tunnels on the Pinghan Railway. When the White bandits retreated, they personally arranged for its destruction, destroying a locomotive and six carriages inside the tunnel, the northern entrance was blown down, and a 13-meter-long and 7-meter-wide section of the mountain in the center of the tunnel was cracked. Through the active efforts of all employees, it was fully completed on the 17th of last month. The 1668 and 112 bridges were completely completed on the 24th of last month, and the trial run was successful on the 25th.
