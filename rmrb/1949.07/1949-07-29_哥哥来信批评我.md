My Brother's Letter Criticizes Me
    Wang Xiaoshun
    Yesterday, my second brother, who is in the army, sent me a letter, in which he greatly criticized me.
    I fully accept this criticism. Because a question that I had been unclear about for a long time, and which is also the easiest for everyone to be vague about, he clarified for me this time.
    At the beginning of last month, my mother taught me to write a letter to my brother, the gist of which was: We were very happy to receive your first letter in five years. After the land reform, our family has been allocated land and livestock, and our life is getting better day by day. The village also takes good care of the military dependents, it is really "One person joins the army, the whole family is honored!" That was one part. It also said: Your troops, under the leadership of our Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, have crossed the Yangtze River and liberated Shanghai, Nanjing,... Now you are going to continue marching south, and the whole of China will soon be liberated. I hope you will capture Guangzhou and Taiwan soon, and catch Chiang Kai-shek. When the revolution is victorious, you will be able to come home earlier, catch up with our cattle, plant our land, and the whole family will be reunited and live a good life.
    The problem lies in the last sentence.
    In his letter, before raising his criticism, my second brother first said: "Your letter is fluent in writing and the handwriting is neat, showing that you have made progress in school in recent years. But the meaning of the last sentence in the letter is problematic if you delve into it, and it must be clarified today." The following are his criticisms. He said: "Our troops must advance rapidly, fight to Guangzhou and Taiwan, and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive. After the national liberation, it will be a victory in military and political terms, but this does not equal the final victory of the entire revolution, nor can it be said that after the national liberation, the soldiers should all lay down their guns and go home to farm. Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us: The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their failure on this land of China. They will also collude with each other and use all possible methods to oppose the Chinese people. Therefore, we must carry the revolution through to the end and not give up halfway. That is to say, even if the remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries are wiped out in the near future, we still cannot relax our national defense construction in the slightest. We not only need a strong army, but also a strong navy and air force to defend our motherland and defend against invaders in the Far East.
    "If the Soviet Union had not paid attention to armed construction at all times after the success of the October Revolution, then in the Second World War, not only would it not have been able to defeat Nazi Germany, but it would have been in danger of becoming Hitler's world. Therefore, the idea of going home to farm after defeating Chiang Kai-shek is the same as the naive idea of some people during the Anti-Japanese War that the revolution would be finally successful after defeating Japanese imperialism. They don't know that 9.5 million square kilometers of land, more than 2,000 kilometers of continental coastline, the vast and boundless airspace, and the lives and property of 475 million people cannot be defended with hoes alone. Of course, this does not mean that it is not important for the rear to work hard in production and construction to support the front line. That's not the case at all, guns and hoes are both important.
    "Second, there is the so-called 'reunion' problem. In fact, this is a small problem, but my mother cares about it the most, so I will talk about it here as well. The 'reunion' mentioned in the letter refers to the whole family staying together every day, planting our few acres of land, 'working at sunrise and resting at sunset,' and this is called 'reunion'. I have been in the army for ten years, not only have I not returned home, but I have also written very few letters. My mother is old, although my eldest brother and you are with her, she sometimes wants to see me, which is understandable. However, as a revolutionary soldier, when Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu issued the order to advance, when we were all crossing the Yangtze River in thousands of ships, when everyone was eager to fight to Guangzhou and Taiwan to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, when we saw Chairman Mao instructing us that if the imperialists still want to take risks, they may send a part of their forces to harass the Chinese border,... who would still think of the 'one cow and ten acres of land' at home? That's one aspect. Conversely, being loyal to the revolution and forgetting oneself is precisely for the sake of our one yellow cow, ten acres of land, and the countless yellow cows and land of millions of compatriots, for the sake of our motherland. If simply keeping a family together is called 'reunion', then weren't we all together before the War of Resistance Against Japan, but why did my father always have to run far away to hide from debts as soon as the twelfth lunar month came, and didn't dare to come back even on New Year's Eve!? Later, relying on relatives and friends was useless, and as a result, he had to go to a coal mine hundreds of miles away, where the mine owner did not care about the life or death of the workers, and finally died at the bottom of the mine? Why did the landlord force the rent in the year of the famine, and my eldest brother had no choice but to work as a short-term worker and beg for food, and there was no news for several years? Can this be called 'reunion'? Today, our family has land, my eldest brother is busy with farming and breeding, you are going to school, and I am working outside. The whole family is doing well. I think this is truly called reunion. You say that I am far away from home in the south of the Yangtze River, but what is far away. Even if we fight to Guangzhou soon, when we get the railway connected, if we want to go home and see you, taking the train back and forth won't take even ten days."
    He concluded by earnestly exhorting me: "Be sure to read the words in the letter to my mother. My mother wants to see me, that is the love between mother and son, but there is a principle that must be understood, that is, if it were not for the revolution, there would be no today, and our family would have starved to death or frozen to death long ago. In the past, the enemy divided us, and it was very difficult to write a letter. In the future, when the whole country is liberated, it will be very easy to come home. Revolution is a long-term plan, and we must have a long-term vision. In the future, when the new China is well-built, everyone can have a good time! It would also be good to tell this to other military dependents and uncles and elders in the village." (Taihang Branch Agency)

### 哥哥来信批评我

　　哥哥来信批评我
    王晓顺
    昨天二哥从部队上来信了，他大大批评了我一番。
    这个批评我完全接受。因为我好久弄不清楚的一个问题，也是大家最容易模糊的问题，他这次给我讲明白了。
    上月初，妈妈教我给哥哥写了封信，大意是说：收到你五年来第一封来信，全家很高兴。土地改革以后，家里分了土地、牲口，生活一天天往上升。村上对军属照顾得也很好，真是“一人参军全家光荣！”这是一段。另外又说：你们部队在咱毛主席、朱总司令领导下，打过了长江，解放了上海、南京、……现在要继续向南进军，全中国眼看就都解放了。希望你们早打下广州、台湾，捉住蒋介石。革命胜利了，你就能早些回家，赶上咱的牛，种上咱的地，全家团圆过生活。
    问题就在最后这句话。
    二哥的来信，在提出批评意见之前，他先说：“你的来信，文句通顺，字体端正，知道你这几年上学进步了。但来信最后那句话的意思，要是深究起来是有毛病的，今天必须把它讲清楚。”以下就是他批评我的意见。他说：“咱们的队伍是要迅速进军，打到广州、台湾，活捉蒋介石的。全国解放以后，在军事上、政治上是胜利啦，但这并不等于整个革命的最后胜利，也不能说全国解放后，战士们就都要放下枪杆，各自回家种地去了。毛主席经常指示我们：帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。他们还要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。所以我们必须把革命进行到底，不能半途而废。这就是说，即使在不久以后把国民党反动的残余势力扫荡光了，还不能丝毫放松我们的国防建设。我们不但需要强大的陆军，还需要有强大的海军和空军，赖以保卫祖国，防御远东的侵略者。
    “苏联在十月革命成功以后，如果不是无时无刻都在注意武装建设；那末，在第二次世界大战中，不但不能战胜法西斯德国，而且有变为希特勒天下的危险。因此打倒了蒋介石就回家种地的说法，还和在抗日期间某些人认为打倒日本帝国主义，革命就最后成功了的幼稚想法是一样的。他们不知道九百五十多万方公里的国土、二千多公里长的大陆海岸线、广漠无垠的领空，与四万万七千五百万人民的生命财产，光用锄头是保卫不了的。当然这并不是说后方努力生产建设，支援前线作战就不重要了。完全就不是这样，枪杆与锄头都很重要。
    “第二、是所谓‘团圆’问题。其实这是个小问题，但妈妈最关心它，所以也在这里一并谈谈。信上所说‘团圆’，是指一家老小每天守在一块儿，种上咱那几亩地，‘日出而作，日入而息’，这样就叫‘团圆’。我参军十年了，不但没有回过家，就是写信也很少。妈妈年纪大了，虽有大哥和你在跟前，但有时也想见见我，这倒是人之常情，无可厚非。但是，作为一个革命战士的我，当毛主席、朱总司令下了进军命令的时候，当我们万船齐发雄渡长江的时候，当大家急切要打到广州、台湾活捉蒋介石的时候，当看到毛主席指示我们说，帝国主义者们要还想冒险的话，也有可能派出一部分兵力侵扰中国边境的时候，……有谁还会想起家里的‘一头牛、十亩地’来呢？这是一方面。反过来说，忠于革命，忘掉自己，也正是为了咱的一头黄牛，十亩土地，以及千百万同胞的无数黄牛和土地，为了我们的祖国。如果单把一家人守在一起才叫做‘团圆’，那末，在抗战以前我们何尝不是都在一起，可是为什么爹爹一交腊月天，为了躲帐，总要跑得远远的，大年三十夜里还不敢回来呢！？后来托亲求友，终是不行，结果自己到几百里外去下煤窑，窑主并不管工人死活的让动弹，最后死在窑底呢？为什么灾荒年地主逼着要租子，大哥无法只好去当短工，又要饭，一走几年没消息呢？这能说成是‘团圆’吗？今天，家里有了土地，大哥闹养种，你上学读书，我在外面工作，一家大小都很好，我认为这才真叫团圆。你说我在江南离家远一些，其实这远个啥。就是不久打到广州了，咱们把铁路修通，要想回家看看，坐上火车连来带走还不用十天。”
    他末了还恳切地嘱咐我说：“千万要把信上的话念给妈妈听。妈妈想见见我，那是母子之情，但有个道理必须明白，就是要不是革命不会有今天，咱一家人早不知道饿死冻死到哪里了。过去敌人分割着，写封信十分困难，今后全国解放了，来趟家也很容易。革命是百年大计，咱们的眼光要放得远一点。将来新中国建设好了，大家可有享福日子过！这件事，说给村上其他军属和叔叔大爷们听，也有好处。”（太行分社电）
