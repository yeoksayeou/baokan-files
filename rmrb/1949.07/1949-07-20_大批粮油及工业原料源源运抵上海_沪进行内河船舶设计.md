Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th: In order to develop inland river transportation, the Shipping Department and the Heavy Industry Department of the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Financial and Economic Takeover Committee convened an "Inland River Ship Design Symposium" on the 16th. More than ten engineers from the China Merchants Bureau, Jiangnan Shipyard, Minsheng Industrial Company, and other organizations attended. The meeting was chaired by Yu Mei, Director of the Shipping Department, and Cheng Wang, Deputy Director of the Heavy Industry Department. The meeting decided to classify ship designs according to river size, distribution, and season. The first type, designed to be suitable for navigation on the Yangtze River, was named "Liberation Type I," and Jiangnan Shipyard was responsible for the design, with a standard of 7.5 feet draft and 1,000 horsepower. The second type, designed to be suitable for navigation on the Gan River, Xiang River, and Han River, was named "Liberation Type II," and Democratic Industrial Company was responsible for the design, with a standard of 5 feet draft and 400 horsepower. The third type, designed to be suitable for navigation on the Grand Canal and Huai River, was named "Liberation Type III," and the China Merchants Bureau was responsible for the design, with a standard of 3.5 feet draft and 200 horsepower. The fourth type, designed to be suitable for navigation during the winter when water levels are low, was named "Liberation Type IV," and the China Merchants Bureau was responsible for the design, with a standard of 2.3 feet draft and 20 horsepower. The fuels to be used on the ships were also determined to be coal and charcoal. The meeting also decided to establish a design committee, with Yu Mei and Cheng Wang serving as the chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. Furthermore, news from Nanjing: Navigation between Nanjing and the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River has gradually resumed. In addition to the China Merchants Bureau ships, the "Minwan" and "Minquan" vessels of the privately owned Minsheng Company are also operating between Shanghai, Anqing, Jiujiang, and Hankou, carrying both passengers and cargo.
