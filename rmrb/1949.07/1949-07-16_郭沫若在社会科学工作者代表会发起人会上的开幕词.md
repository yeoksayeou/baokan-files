    Therefore, only the proletariat can display the highest degree of seeking truth from facts in the study of social development, as well as in the study of natural development, recognizing that the entire natural world is an interconnected whole, that there is nothing immutable in nature, that all existence is in a process of change, from quantitative change to qualitative change, from gradual change to sudden change, and that the generation of change is due to internal contradictions—the struggle of opposites, leading to development from the lower to the higher. Under the illumination of this dialectical materialism, social science has become a true science, and natural science has achieved higher development, solving problems that bourgeois natural science cannot solve.

    This proletarian scientific theory, initiated by Marx and Engels and developed by Lenin and Stalin, has unfolded the light of truth for mankind. This light has illuminated the distant past of human history and also illuminated the great future of human history. Every nation that comes into contact with this truth is like receiving a huge torch in the deep darkness, no longer groping in the dark. We Chinese people also grasped this torch about thirty years ago after various gropings in the dark.

    With the illumination of Marxism-Leninism, we understand how to study the laws of Chinese social and historical development and how to study the problems of the Chinese revolution. The conclusions drawn from such research are based on an unshakable and true scientific foundation, and therefore can exert incomparably great power in the revolutionary practice of the broad masses. The victory of our Chinese revolution, following the Soviet October Revolution and the victory over fascism in World War II, once again proves that Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth applicable to all corners of the world.

    Here we cannot but mention the great name of our people's leader—Mao Zedong. The merit of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the name of Mao Zedong. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the compass for all our scientific workers today, and Mao Zedong is the most brilliant mentor, especially for our social science workers.

    Today, when the Chinese revolution has achieved a basic victory, a new task has emerged before our social science workers—to establish the New Democratic New China under the leadership of the proletariat and steadily transition to the stage of socialism and communism. This is a huge and unparalleled scientific undertaking. Here, we will encounter countless new problems, new crux, and new difficulties that we have never encountered before. We must use collective strength to earnestly learn to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to solve all these problems, all the crux, and all the difficulties.

    Imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism have been defeated at present, but they will not give up easily for a while, and they will definitely carry out various conspiracies to disrupt our construction undertakings. Moreover, their remaining poison is very deep, and sometimes those toxins may still be lurking in our own hearts. Therefore, in the construction process of the New Democratic New China, we still have to carry out sharp ideological struggles to eliminate all the remnants of the old era, resist all possible conspiracies and tricks, and thoroughly eliminate all possible invisible enemies.

    We do not want to deny that in the old society, many friends who studied philosophy, history, economics, politics, and law have never had the opportunity to come into contact with the truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and some are even blinded by the prejudices of the old era and avoid this truth. However, most of them have the enthusiasm to pursue progress and patriotism, and attempt to solve certain partial problems of China through research in various departments. Moreover, to a certain extent, some friends have also harvested some valuable achievements, first of all, in the contact of certain materials. But it is undeniable that these valuable achievements are still limited and are achieved with half the effort. Why? Because it is the result of groping in the dark. Today, the victory of the Chinese revolution has reminded these friends, aroused their desire and interest in relearning, and some have already begun to study earnestly. This phenomenon is worth welcoming. Those who can still have considerable achievements under the limitations of the old standpoints and methods will surely have higher and greater achievements once they adopt new standpoints and methods, which is beyond doubt.

    At the same time, we also do not want to deny that although the Marxist-Leninist theory in China, under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, has achieved the basic victory of the Chinese revolution and has already had great gains, in general, the theoretical level of our social science workers has not yet reached the required level, and the combination of theory and practice has not yet reached the required depth and breadth. Especially when compared with the current new historical tasks, we feel even more that the rope is short and the well is deep, and our inadequacies become even clearer. Not only in terms of quality is it difficult for us to cope with the current needs, but also in terms of quantity it is difficult for us to cope with. If we are unwilling to strengthen learning, unwilling to carry out popularization work on a large scale, and extensively cultivate promising and vigorous social science workers, then our social science workers will find it difficult to complete the tasks we should complete in the position of building a new China.

    Therefore, we urgently feel that we must strive to improve our theoretical level and work ability, unite all social science workers into a strong camp under the direction of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, use collective strength to spread Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses of the people, earnestly serve the people, and work together for the construction of a new China. This is the main purpose of our launching the National Congress of Social Science Workers.

    Friends, the task of nation-building is very arduous. Today, not only in the vertical aspect, we must intensify unity in our posts, align our steps, and carry out the study and application, popularization and improvement of social sciences in a planned, organized, and step-by-step manner, but also in the horizontal aspect, we must closely cooperate with the entire cultural front and even the military front, and strive to advance together.

    From the perspective of the entire cultural front, today, brother troops in all major areas are planning national organizations. The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers has been convened, and the preparatory meeting for the National Conference of Natural Science Workers and the preparatory meeting for the All-China Journalists Association have also opened simultaneously yesterday. The preparatory meeting for the National Conference of Educational Workers is scheduled to be held on the 22nd. We social science workers should strive to play the role of vanguard among the five major field armies on this cultural front. Today, we can no longer hesitate. We must learn from the military front, learn from other brother troops on the cultural front, and join hands to jointly win continuous and brilliant victories on the cultural front!

    Many of the friends present today are proficient in Marxism-Leninism in the departments of philosophy, history, economics, politics, and law. They must have given deep thought and have a well-thought-out plan for the cooperation between the division and the whole, and for the connection between the vertical and the horizontal. Therefore, we believe that we will smoothly produce a preparatory committee from today's initiators' meeting to carry out all the preparatory work, so that the National Congress of Social Science Workers can be convened as soon as possible, so that social science workers across the country can unite, study together, work together, and jointly participate in the construction of a new China, and wholeheartedly contribute all our strength to the great cause of building a New Democratic New China, and in the great cause of steadily rising the New China to a socialist and communist society!

    郭沫若在社会科学工作者
    代表会发起人会上的开幕词
    （续昨日一版）
    因此，只有无产阶级才能够在社会发展的研究中，同样在自然发展的研究中，发挥最高度的实事求是的精神，认定整个自然界是互相联系的一个整体，自然界中没有一成不变的东西，一切存在都在变化的过程中，由量变到质变，由渐变到突变，而变化的产生是由于内在的矛盾——对立的斗争，以导向从低级到高级的发展。在这一辩证唯物主义的照明之下，才使社会科学成为了真正的科学，并使自然科学得到了更高的发展，解决了资产阶级自然科学所不能解决的问题。
    由马克思、恩格斯所创导，由列宁、斯大林所发展了的这一无产阶级的科学理论，给人类展开了真理的光芒。这光芒透视了人类历史长远的过去，也照明了人类历史远大的将来。每一个民族接触到了这一真理，都好象在深沉的黑夜中得到了巨大的火炬一样，不再在暗中摸索了。我们中国人民也是在经过了种种的暗中摸索之后，在约略三十年前才把这支火炬掌握到手里来。
    有了马列主义的照明，我们才懂得怎样来研究中国社会历史发展的规律，怎样来研究中国革命的问题。从这样的研究所得出结论，是建立在颠扑不破的真正的科学基础上面的，故能够在广大群众的革命实践中发挥出无比伟大的力量。目前我们中国革命的胜利，继苏联十月革命和第二次世界大战战胜法西斯主义之后，又一次地证明了马列主义是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理了。
    在这里我们不能不提到我们的人民领袖——毛泽东的伟大的名字。把马列主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合起来了的功绩，是和毛泽东的名字分不开来的。马列主义和毛泽东思想是我们今天一切科学工作者的指南针，毛泽东特别对于我们社会科学工作者是最光辉的导师。
    在中国革命已经获得了基本胜利的今天，在我们社会科学工作者的面前，便出现了一个新的任务——要我们把无产阶级所领导的新民主主义的新中国建立起来，并稳步的过渡到社会主义与共产主义的阶段。这是一个巨大无比的科学事业。在这里将会遇到无数新的问题，新的症结，新的困难，为我们过去所从未遇到过的。我们必须用集体的力量来认真地学会用马列主义和毛泽东思想来解决这一切问题，一切症结，一切困难的方法。
    帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在目前是被打败了，但他们一时还不会死心，他们还一定要进行种种的阴谋来扰乱我们的建设事业。而且他们的遗毒很深，有时候那些毒素还可能潜伏在我们自己的心里。因而，在新民主主义新中国的建设过程中，我们还不能不进行尖锐的思想斗争，来肃清一切旧时代的遗毒，抵抗一切可能有的阴谋诡计，彻底消灭一切可能有的无形的敌人。
    我们并不想否认，在旧社会中有不少研究哲学、历史、经济、政治、法律的朋友，一向没有机会接触到马列主义与毛泽东思想的真理，有的更为旧时代的偏见所蒙蔽而回避这种真理，但他们大多数具有追求进步和爱国的热诚，企图通过各部门的研究来解决中国的某些部分问题。而且在某种程度上说，某些朋友也曾收获到了某些部分的首先是某些材料的接触上的可贵的成就的。但也无可讳言，这些可贵的成就毕竟有限，而且是事倍功半的。为什么？因为只是在暗中摸索的成果。今天中国革命的胜利提醒了这些朋友们，使他们发生了重新学习的志愿和兴趣，而且有的已经认真在开始学习，这一现象是值得我们欢迎的。凡是在旧的立场和方法的限制下，都还能够有相当成就的人，一旦采取了新的立场和方法必定会有更高更大的成就，那是毫无疑问的事。
    同时我们也并不想否认，中国的马列主义理论在毛泽东思想的领导下，虽然已经取得了中国革命的基本胜利，已经有了很大的收获，但一般说来，我们一般社会科学工作者的理论水平还没有达到应有的水平，而理论与实际的结合也还没有达到应有的深度和广度。特别是和当前的新的历史任务对照起来，更觉得绠短汲深，我们的不够处便显得更加明了了。不仅在质量上我们对于当前的需要很难应付，就在数量上我们也很难应付。我们假如不肯加强学习，不肯大规模的做普及工作，广泛地培养奋发有为与年富力强的社会科学工作者，则我们的社会科学工作者在建设新中国的岗位上，是很难完成我们应该完成的任务的。
    因此，我们迫切地感觉着，我们必须努力来提高我们的理论水平和工作能力，把一切社会科学工作者在马列主义和毛泽东思想的方向下团结成为一个强大的阵营，用集体的力量把马列主义和毛泽东思想向广大的人民群众中展开，切实地为人民服务，为新中国的建设而共同奋斗。这就是我们要发起全国社会科学工作者代表会议的主要目的。
    朋友们，建国的任务是很艰巨的，我们今天不仅在纵的方面，要在本岗位上加紧团结，整齐步武，有计划有组织有步骤地来进行社会科学的学习与运用，普及与提高，同时还须得在横的方面，和整个的文化战线乃至军事战线密切配合，努力齐头并进。
    从整个的文化战线来讲，今天各大方面的兄弟部队都在策划着全国性的组织了。中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会已经召开，全国自然科学工作者会议的筹备会，全国新闻工作者协会的筹备会议都已经同时在昨天开幕，全国教育工作者代表会议筹备会议已定于二十二日举行。我们社会科学工作者在这文化战线上的五大野战军中应该努力去争取担任先锋队的作用。今天，我们是再不能踌蹰了。我们必须向军事战线看齐，向文化战线上的其它兄弟部队看齐，手携手地在文化战线上也共同打出连续不断的辉煌的胜仗！
    今天到会的朋友，不少是精通马列主义的哲学、史学、经济学、政治学、法学各部门的朋友，对于分与总的配合，对于纵与横的联系，一定都是经过了深思熟虑，胸有成竹的。因此我们相信，我们从今天的发起人大会中一定会很顺利地产生出一个筹备会来进行一切的准备工作，使全国社会科学工作者代表会议早日召开，使全国社会科学工作者团结起来，共同学习、共同工作、共同努力参加新中国的建设，在建设新民主主义的新中国的伟大事业中，在使新中国稳步的上升到社会主义和共产主义社会的伟大事业中，全心全意地供献出我们的一切力量！
