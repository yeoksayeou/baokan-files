　　[Ping City News] The North China People's Government Joint Office Meeting decided in mid-June that various departments should organize cadres to go to the countryside to inspect work. Various inspection teams, consisting of more than fifty people, have gone to areas such as eastern Hebei, central Hebei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Taihang, and southern Hebei to inspect production work, the implementation of laws and decrees of the North China People's Government, problems in implementation, and how to solve them. In addition to specializing in inspecting producers, each inspection team also conducts key inspections in conjunction with the work of its respective department. For example, the Ministry of Civil Affairs focuses on inspecting the production of families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers, as well as disabled soldiers, the use of relief grain, preferential treatment for land cultivation on behalf of soldiers' families, and the issuance of land certificates, as well as assisting local democratic construction work; the Ministry of Justice focuses on inspecting the implementation after the abolition of the old reactionary laws and the work of clearing up accumulated cases; the Ministry of Public Security mainly inspects rural public security work; the Ministry of Health, while inspecting work, also organizes epidemic prevention teams to go to the countryside to carry out epidemic prevention work; the pest control team organized by the Ministry of Agriculture has also gone to the countryside to work.

　　In order to combine the inspection work of various departments, the Joint Office Meeting of the North China People's Government also conducted inspections of the work of the government leadership organs. For this reason, all departments must pay attention to the inspection reports from various places, proceed from reality, seek solutions to problems, and use them as guidelines for guiding work.
