　　Utilizing Waste Materials and Improving Technology
  　Production and Economy Campaign Launched in Various Units of the Pingjin Railway Bureau

[Report from our Tianjin office] Since the Pingjin Railway Bureau's three-month production and economy campaign for July, August, and September was communicated in late June, various units have responded enthusiastically, and significant results have already been achieved. The electrical workshop of the Tianjin Jinpu Main Factory has repaired 56 electric motors abandoned for more than two years by the Kuomintang bandit gangs. The riveting department assembles one car in 100 hours, greatly exceeding the original plan of one car in 400 hours. The casting and forging workers have turned more than ten tons of scrap iron into useful property. Workers at the Guye Inspection Section brave the rain to rush and repair vehicles, and have modified them to use wooden journal box front rolls, saving 0.6 kilograms of oil and 0.32 kilograms of cotton waste per journal box. The widespread implementation of this modification on all horizontally-opening journal box freight cars in the bureau is being planned. To save gasoline, the Road Bureau's motor vehicle team has converted a car to burn wood charcoal, saving 780 gallons of gasoline this month compared to May. Staff and nurses at the Nankou Railway Hospital wash their own sheets and clothes during off-duty hours. Workers at the Xizhimen Station in Beiping use their spare time to repair walls, etc. The locomotive depot has reduced the number of shunting locomotives from four to three, while still completing the same tasks. Workers in the B and C inspection teams have also taken on repair work with one team, releasing another team to other production departments. In addition, a copper donation campaign was launched, and over 100 kilograms have already been donated. Tangshan, Datong, and Dezhou are also actively carrying out this campaign. To further promote this movement, the Pingjin Railway Bureau has dispatched investigation teams to strengthen assistance to various units.

　　利用废料·提高技术
  　平津铁路局各单位开展生产节约立功运动
    【本报天津讯】平津铁路管理局七八九三个月生产节约立功运动，自六月下旬传达后，各单位热烈响应，迄今已获显著成绩。天津津浦大厂电工场，修复了国民党匪帮废置了两年多的电动机五十六台。铆工部一百小时装车一辆，大大超过了原来四百小时装车一辆的计划。铸工、锻工将十余吨废铁变成了有用的财产。古冶检车段职工，冒雨赶修车辆，并改用木制轴箱前卷，使每个轴箱省油点六公斤、棉丝点三二公斤，全局横开式轴箱货车，正计划普遍推行。路局汽车队，为节省汽油，将一部汽车改用木炭燃烧，本月已较五月节省汽油七八○加伦。南口铁路医院职工、护士于工余时间，自己洗涤床单、衣服等。北平西直门车站职工，利用工余修砌围墙等，机务段将四台调车机车，减为三台，且同样完成任务。乙、丙检工友，亦由一部担任检修工作，抽出一部转入其他生产部门。此外并发起献铜运动，刻已献出百余公斤。唐山、大同、德县各地也都积极开展这一运动。为了更进一步开展这一运动，平津铁路管理局已于日前派出调查组，加强对各单位的协助。
