    Episode 20: Victory
    Brave!
    Brave!
    Be Brave Again!
    --Order of Commander-in-Chief Zhu
    When the sun comes out, the sky is bright,
    The red flag is planted on the city wall.
  　--Folk song
    I
    The moon had not yet risen, and it was very dark.
    Company Commander Gao Tuncr gathered the team on the big field. This company was made up of young farmers who had just been transferred from the village. Although they were wearing all kinds of clothes, they all had bullet belts around them, carrying big guns, full of spirit, and stood neatly. They had been trained and fought, and they already looked like the real thing.
    Gao Tuncr stood in front, his body straight, waving his fist and said: "Comrades! For two whole days and nights, everyone has been carrying out tasks without rest; but to eliminate the devils and traitors, we must make a final effort, are you tired?" A hundred and dozens of people shouted: "Not tired!" Gao Tuncr said: "Good, prepare immediately to carry out the task, besiege the North Gate!"
    Political Instructor Niu Dashui gave a speech: "Comrades! Setting off tonight, no one is allowed to smoke, cough, or speak casually. The vanguards in front must pay attention to the signs at any time when they hear any movement, and judge the situation, and should practice reconnaissance and search well. On the other hand, don't make a fuss about anything. No matter what happens, you must be calm and composed, don't call Zhang San and shout Li Si. Those who see something on the periphery are not allowed to shoot casually, so as not to expose the target. Comrades, the final victory is just around the corner, Commander-in-Chief Zhu issued an order, calling on us to be brave, brave, and brave again! Each of us must respond to his call, not be afraid of sacrifice, and resolutely complete the task!" The soldiers shouted: "We will definitely complete the task!"
    The company groped along the road in the dark, reached the embankment, and then followed the embankment eastward, quietly searching forward. The river was flowing with a gurgling sound, and sometimes the fish were swallowing on the surface of the water, making a popping sound. The North Gate could be seen, and the watchtower of the North Gate was lit.
    The team squatted down for a while, and then moved forward. Not far from the tower, they hid in the woods. Dashui and Tuncr gave Platoon Leader Hu Erniu a task, so Hu Erniu led a squad of people along the river, sneaking to the front of the four big barges. Seven people climbed on the embankment to guard, and eight people quietly boarded the boat. The boatmen were all asleep in the cabin. The eight people gently raised the anchor, put it on the boat, and the boat slowly slid down with the water.
    Hu Erniu and his seven men on the shore waited for the boat to go far, then withdrew to report, saying: "The four big barges have been taken away, the enemy can't escape!" The company groped forward again, and deployed behind the houses of the North Gate. After a while, the Fifth Company also came, with two or three hundred people, completely sealing off the city gate, watchtower, main streets, and small alleys.
    That night, nearly ten militia companies approached the town from all directions; even the old folks from the surrounding countryside were organized, some carrying stretchers, some carrying ladders, some carrying iron picks and shovels... following the militia companies. The militia and the people together totaled several thousand people, surrounding the county seat tightly. Everyone was eager to open the city and eliminate the devils and traitors. Everyone was extremely excited; they had been looking forward to this day for so many years!

    II
    He Shixiong in the city could not have imagined that the situation would change so quickly. Since Japan announced its surrender, he had accepted the order passed down by Chiang Kai-shek, not to allow the Eighth Route Army to disarm, but to hide the devil commander. On the surface, he played many tricks, making the people look as if the Japanese soldiers had all become prisoners, so there was no problem; but in his bones, he colluded with the Japanese to jointly deal with the Eighth Route Army.
    Tonight, the Eighth Route Army surrounded the city. He Shixiong hurried to the devil commander to discuss.
    In the devil commander's room, there was a small bronze Buddha enshrined, with vegetables, soup, and dried fruit snacks placed in front of the bronze Buddha. Commander Guiban was standing straight in front of the small bronze Buddha, bowing his head, mumbling, praying to the gods and Buddhas to bless him to keep his old life and return to his country. He Shixiong stood beside him, not daring to disturb him, waiting anxiously for a long time. After Guiban finished chanting, he respectfully bowed three times to the small bronze Buddha, and then beckoned He Shixiong to sit down, and the two began to talk.
    Lately, Guiban's face has become thinner, his cheekbones higher, and even his Ren Dan mustache is not trimmed, often holding a beer bottle and drinking like crazy. Now, when he heard that the Communist army had surrounded the city, it was as if he had been hit on the head with an iron hammer, his "Yamato spirit" instantly left his body, and all the "Bushido spirit" in his body leaked out of his asshole, sitting there dumbfounded, unable to speak for a long time.
    He Shixiong asked him what to do, and he finally came back to his senses. The two studied for a long time, estimating that the strength in the city could barely last for three days, the city defense works were still solid, and the Eighth Route Army lacked heavy weapons, so they would not be able to attack it for a while; as long as Baoding sent troops to take over, breaking through would not be a problem. --Speaking of this, the devil commander breathed a sigh of relief, jumped up, and shouted in a high-pitched voice: "Kami sama, ta si ke de ku lai! (God bless)"
    He immediately sent a telegram to Baoding. He Shixiong hurried back to pass on the order, telling the troops to desperately defend the city, waiting for reinforcements to arrive; on the one hand, he settled his concubine, packing up gold and silver jewelry and other valuable things, preparing to escape as soon as the reinforcements arrived. ...After everything was arranged, he smoked calmly, and discussed the issue of Yang Xiaomei with Zhang Jinlong, and sent someone to bring her out.

    III
    Xiaomei had already been interrogated twice. The first time was when she was first brought into the city. He Shixiong deceived her because she was a woman, and wanted to soften her with tricks, and asked her to be a spy. He first sent someone to bandage her wounds, gave her good food, and then called her to his own room and sat opposite her to talk. He said to Xiaomei with a smiling face: "Yang Xiaomei, you are a person with talent, and you are smart and capable. I have heard about it for a long time. It's a pity that a person like you is on the wrong path! You have been deceived, and following those bandit troops, how can you grow up? Think about it carefully!"
    Xiaomei held the child, turned her body and sat down, and said angrily: "You are talking nonsense! The Eighth Route Army is resisting Japan and saving the country, and the people support it. Why can't it grow up? You, a die-hard traitor, kill the people and rob the people; even a talking child scolds you, can you grow up? When you are caught, everyone will skin you and pull your tendons! One person will poke you to death with one finger!"
    He Shixiong was not angry, and said with a fake smile: "Yang Xiaomei, you should look at things from a broader perspective, and don't let the Communist Party's propaganda confuse you! Look how cruel the Communist Party is, asking a woman like you to do such dangerous work, and end up in such a miserable situation. Alas, it's so pitiful! I think you might as well follow me and do something, and you will definitely have a future!" Xiaomei looked at him, frowned, and glared at him and said: "Don't talk nonsense! This is what I wanted to do myself. I am happy to deal with you traitors! Falling into your hands, I only have the future of glorious sacrifice. You can kill me as you please!"
    He Shixiong looked at the child in her hand and said: "If you die, don't you feel sorry for your child?" Xiaomei gritted her teeth, put Xiao Pang on the table, and said: "I don't feel sorry for the child, you quickly take me out and kill me, it will be a pleasure!"
    Xiao Pang cried. He Shixiong picked him up with his own hands, deliberately patted the child and said: "Yang Xiaomei, don't be so cruel! If I want you to die, I just need to move my mouth, but I don't want you to make a futile sacrifice, a thousand pieces of gold can't buy a breath! It doesn't matter if you can't figure it out for a while, go back and think carefully. I am being so nice to you, and I have never been so polite to anyone else!" He asked people to take Xiaomei and her child down.
    The puppet soldiers who were listening to the interrogation outside were very sympathetic to Yang Xiaomei, and discussed in private: "This woman is really something, she is really tough!" They secretly went to take care of Yang Xiaomei.
    The second time she was interrogated, He Shixiong still said with a fake smile: "Yang Xiaomei, how is it? Are you feeling suffocated? Don't worry, don't get angry, sit down and let's talk. How have you been thinking these days?" Xiaomei said: "I don't need to think, I would rather die!"
    He Shixiong pretended to cherish her very much and said: "Don't just go down a dead end, you can only die once! Can you really bear to part with your Xiao Pangzi?" Xiaomei said fiercely: "At this moment, I can bear to part with anyone!" He Shixiong pretended to pity her and said: "Alas! If you die, who will this motherless child be handed over to?"
    Xiaomei couldn't help crying. He Shixiong couldn't help laughing in his heart. He thought triumphantly: "After all, she is a woman, soft-hearted, and easy to talk to..." He was about to open his mouth to pull her again, but Xiaomei wiped her tears and said: "I cry, not for anything else, but because I didn't complete the task, but fell into the hands of you die-hard traitors. If I die, this child will not survive either, so it is better to kill our mother and son together, anyway, someone will avenge us in the future!"
    He Shixiong was snubbed again, and he was so angry that his facial features were displaced. He glanced at Yang Xiaomei viciously, smiled coldly on his face, and walked out. Immediately, several secret agents came, saying that there was no need to use major torture on women, so they snatched the child, pulled Xiaomei over and pressed her with a lever. The wound on Xiaomei's shoulder had rotted into a big hole, and when they pulled and tore her, she passed out as soon as she was pressed with a lever.
    When she woke up, she cried and cursed, and cursed and cursed, and then they pressed her to death again. But she would never yield. Finally, several people carried her and locked her back in the prison.
    Many of the puppet soldiers who were listening to the interrogation outside shed tears, secretly sighing: "Alas! Yang Xiaomei is really a good person, really fierce!" They secretly went to see Yang Xiaomei and treat her wounds.

    On the night when Dashui and the others surrounded the city, He Shixiong asked people to bring Xiaomei out, and he had already had the idea of shooting her in his heart. If Yang Xiaomei was afraid of death and yielded, he would prepare to take her to Baoding and use her as capital for revenge in the future.
    He said to Xiaomei: "Yang Xiaomei, have you considered it? This is the last time I ask you, whether you want to live or die, you can say it yourself!" Xiaomei knew that he was going to kill her! Her face was pale, but she said calmly: "You don't need to ask! My death will complete my revolutionary task!" He Shixiong asked people to take the child away, but Xiaomei hugged Xiao Pang tightly and refused to let go, saying: "My mother and son want to die together."
    Just then, the bugle sounded outside the South Gate, and gunshots rang out in all directions; Zhang Jinlong hurriedly ran over, leaned close to He Shixiong, and said in a low voice: "The situation is very tight, the enemy has launched a general attack! I am afraid that the East Gate and the South Gate cannot be defended, what do you think should be done?" He Shixiong's face was icy and calm, pretending to be calm and said: "It doesn't matter!" He waved his hand and told people to take Yang Xiaomei out and shoot her.
    Xiaomei knew that the comrades had attacked the city, and laughed loudly: "Good, good, good! He Shixiong! You traitors and national traitors, you are finished! My death, my death will also be a happy one!"
    The puppet soldiers pushed Xiaomei out. Xiaomei heard the gunshots outside the city and was so excited that her whole body trembled. She couldn't help shouting: "Down with Japanese imperialism! Down with the traitors and national traitors! Long live the Communist Party!..."

　　新儿女英雄传
    袁静  孔厥
    第二十回　胜利
    勇敢！
    勇敢！
    再勇敢！
    ——朱总司令的命令
    太阳出来天大亮，
    红旗插到城墙上。
  　——民歌
    一
    月亮还没上来，天很黑。
    连长高屯儿把队伍集合在大场上。这一连人，都是村里才调出来的青年农民，虽然穿着各色各样的衣裳，可是一律缠着子弹带，背着大枪，精神饱满的，站了个齐整。他们受过训练打过仗，已经很象个样儿啦。
    高屯儿站在前面，身上挺得笔直，挥着拳头说：“同志们！整整两天两夜，大伙儿执行任务，没有休息；可是要消灭鬼子汉奸，还得最后努力，你们累不累？”一百几十人一声吼：“不累！”高屯儿说：“好，马上准备执行任务，围攻北关！”
    指导员牛大水讲话说：“同志们！今晚上出发，谁也不许抽烟咳嗽，随便讲话。前面的尖兵听到什么动静，要随时注意征候，判断情况，应该好好儿＠炼侦察搜索。另一方面，有事儿不准大惊小怪。不论发生任何情况，都得镇静沉着，不要叫张三喊李四的。外围瞅见什么，不准随便打枪，免得暴露目标。同志们，最后胜利就在眼前，朱总司令发布了命令，叫咱们勇敢，勇敢，再勇敢！我们每一个人都要响应他的号召，不怕牺牲，坚决完成任务！”战士们都喊：“一定完成任务！”
    一连人摸黑走大路，到了堤上，又顺着堤往东，悄悄儿搜索前进。河水哗哗的流着，有时候鱼儿在水面上吞食，啪啪的响。望得见北门外，北关岗楼亮着灯光。
    队伍一会儿蹲下，一会儿前进。离楼不远了，他们隐蔽在树林里。大水高屯儿给排长胡二牛一个任务，胡二牛就带上一班人，沿着河边，偷偷摸到四只大槽子根前。七个人爬在堤坡上警戒，八个人悄悄儿上船。船夫在船舱里都睡着了。八个人轻轻起了锚，放在船上，船就慢慢儿顺着水流，溜下去了。
    岸上胡二牛他们七个，等船儿走远，就撤回来报告，说：“四只大槽子弄走了，敌人可跑不了啦！”一连人又往前摸过去，在北关的民房后面布置开。一会儿，第五连也来了两下里三百多人，把城门、岗楼、大街小巷，全封锁了个严实。
    这天晚上，将近有十个民兵连，从四面八方逼近城关；连四乡的老百姓都组织起来，有的抬着担架，有的扛着梯子，有的拿着铁镐铁铣……跟着民兵连。民兵和老百姓一共好几千人，把县城团团儿围起来。人人心里都恨不得一下把城攻开，消灭鬼子和汉奸。大伙儿兴奋极了；这么些年，早盼着这一天啦！
    二
    城里的何世雄，可想不到形势变得这么快。自从日本宣布投降，他接受了蒋介石传下来的命令，不给八路军缴枪，倒把鬼子司令藏起来了。他表面上耍了许多把戏，叫老百姓看着好象日本兵都成了俘虏，就没有问题了；骨子里可是和日本人串通一气，共同对付八路军。
    今晚上八路军围城了。何世雄忙去找鬼子司令商议。
    鬼子司令的屋子里，供着个小铜佛，铜佛跟前放了菜、汤，和干果点心。司令龟板在小铜佛的面前，直直的立着，低下头，嘴里嘀哩嘟噜的念叨，正在求神告菩萨，保佑他留下这条老命，回到本国去呢。何世雄站在旁边，不敢打扰他，着急的等了半天。龟板念叨完了，又对小铜佛恭恭敬敬的鞠了三个躬，才招呼何世雄坐下，两个人就谈起来。
    这一向，龟板脸儿更瘦，颧骨更高了，连仁丹胡子也不修剪，常捧着个啤酒瓶子死灌。现在他一听说共产军已经围了城，好象脑门心上挨了一铁锤，他的“大和魂”一下子出了窍，浑身的“武士道精神”都从屁眼儿里走了气，目瞪口呆的坐在那里，半天说不出话儿。
    何世雄问他怎么办，他才转过神来。两个人研究半天，估计城里的力量，凑凑合合可以维持三天，城防工事还算坚固，八路军又缺少重武器，一时不会攻下来；只要保定派队伍来接，突围就没有问题。——谈到这里，鬼子司令松了一口气，跳起来，尖嗓喊了一句：“卡米杀马，他死可得哭来！（菩萨保佑）”
    他马上给保定打电报。何世雄忙回去传命令，叫部队拼命守城，等待援兵到来；一面安顿他的小婆，把金银首饰和其他宝贵的东西收拾好，准备援兵一到，就突围逃跑。……一切安排停当，他从容的抽着烟，又和张金龙商量了一下杨小梅的问题，就派人把她提出来。
    三
    小梅已经过了两次堂。第一次是刚解到城里的时候。何世雄欺她是个妇女，想用哄骗的手段软化她，叫她当特务，先派人给她裹伤口，吃好的，再把她叫到自己住的屋里，坐在对面谈话。他满脸笑容的对小梅说：“杨小梅，你是个有材料的人，又聪明又能干，我早就听说了。象你这样的人，走在邪道上，真可惜！你是受了蒙蔽啦，跟着那些匪军跑，还能长得了？你好好儿想想吧！”
    小梅抱着孩子，侧转身子坐着，气愤愤的说：“你这是放屁呢！八路军抗日救国，老百姓人人拥护，为什么长不了？你这个铁杆汉奸，杀老百姓，抢老百姓；是个会说话的小孩儿都骂你，你能长得了？逮住你的时候，谁也要剥你的皮，抽你的筋！一人一手指头就捅死你！”
    何世雄并不生气，假笑着说：“杨小梅，你眼光放远点，别叫共产党的迷魂汤把你迷住了！你看共产党多残忍，叫你一个妇道人家，做这样危险的工作，落到这么一个悲惨的地步。唉，真可怜！我看你倒不如跟着我做一点事，准有你的前途！”小梅看着他，眉毛一纠，眼睛一瞪说：“你别胡扯！这是我自个儿要来的。拾掇你们这些汉奸，我心里才乐意呢！犯在你的手里，我只有光荣牺牲的前途。要杀要剐随你的便！”
    何世雄看着她手里的孩子说：“你死，就不可怜可怜你的孩子啊？”小梅咬着牙，把小胖往桌上一放，说：“我不可怜孩子，你赶快拉我出去，杀了倒痛快！”
    小胖哭了。何世雄亲手把他抱起来，故意拍着孩子说：“杨小梅，别那么狠心！我要叫你死，只要我动动嘴皮子就行了，可是我不愿意叫你作无谓的牺牲，千金难买一口气啊！你一时脑子里转不过弯来也不要紧，回去再仔细想想吧。我这是对你，除了你，对谁也没有这么客气过！”就叫人把小梅娘儿俩带下去了。
    外面听堂的伪军们，对杨小梅非常同情，背地里议论：“这妇道真行，真不松啊！”他们暗里都偷偷的去照顾杨小梅。
    第二次过堂，何世雄还是皮笑肉不笑的说：“杨小梅，怎么样？憋闷得慌吧？你别着急，别起火，好好儿坐下，咱们谈谈。这几天你想得怎么样？”小梅说：“我用不着想，我情愿死！”
    何世雄假装很爱惜她似的说：“你可别光钻一个死门儿，要死也就是一回啊！你真舍得了你的小胖子吗？”小梅狠狠的说：“到了这会儿，我什么人都舍得了！”何世雄装作可怜她的样子说：“唉！你死了，这没娘的孩子交给谁去呀？”
    小梅忍不住哭了。何世雄心里可忍不住笑了。他得意的想：“到底是娘们家，心软，好说话……”他正想开口再拉她一把，小梅可擦着眼泪说：“我哭，不是哭别的，是哭我没完成任务，倒落在你这个铁杆汉奸的手里。我死了，这孩子也活不成，不如把我们娘儿俩一块儿弄死，反正将来会有人给我们报仇的！”
    何世雄又碰了个钉子，气得五官都挪了位，对杨小梅狠毒的射了一眼，脸上冷笑着，走出去了。立时来了几个特务，说是对妇女不用动大刑，就夺下孩子，把小梅拉过来压杠子。小梅肩膀上的伤烂了一个大窟窿，给他们生拉活扯，一压杠子就死过去了。
    她醒过来就大哭大骂，骂着骂着又给他们压了个死。她可怎么也不屈服。最后，几个人把她架着，又关到监牢里去了。
    外面听堂的伪军们，好些个掉眼泪，暗地里赞叹：“唉！杨小梅真是个好样儿的，真烈性啊！”他们背地里都偷着去看杨小梅，给她治伤。
    大水他们围城的这天夜里何世雄叫人把小梅提出来，心里已经存着枪毙她的念头。如果杨小梅怕死屈服了，就准备带她到保定，利用她作将来报仇的资本。
    他对小梅说：“杨小梅，你考虑好了没有？这是我最后一次问你，要死要活，你自己说一句吧！”小梅知道他要下毒手了！她脸色发白，可是镇静的说：“你不用问！我死就完成我革命的任务了！”何世雄就叫人把孩子抱走，小梅可紧紧的抱着小胖不放，说：“我娘儿俩要死死在一块儿。”
    就在这当儿，南门外的号声响了，四面八方都起了枪声；张金龙匆匆忙忙跑来，凑在何世雄跟前，低声说：“情况紧得很，敌人总攻了！东门南门恐怕都守不住，你看这事儿怎么办？”何世雄冰铁着脸儿，假装平静的说：“不碍事！”就挥一挥手，叫人把杨小梅拉出去枪毙。
    小梅知道同志们攻城了，哈哈大笑说：“好好好！何世雄！你们这些汉奸卖国贼，马上就完蛋了！我死，死也死得痛快！”
    伪军把小梅推出去，小梅听见城外枪声打了个欢，激动得浑身发颤，忍不住大声喊：“打倒日本帝国主义啊！打倒汉奸卖国贼啊！共产党万岁！……”
