　　Literary and Art Troops Triumphantly Converge in Beiping
    National Literary and Art Congress Opens
  　Commander-in-Chief Zhu Delivers Speech on Behalf of the CCP Central Committee
    [Beiping City News] The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers of China solemnly opened in Beiping on the 2nd. Guests included Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Lin Boqu, Dong Biwu, Lu Dingyi, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Peng Zemin, Cai Tingkai, and representatives from workers, peasants, women, and youth, totaling more than 30 people. The congress began amidst music. Representatives from various posts across China unanimously expressed their gratitude for the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, which enabled this unprecedentedly magnificent literary and art army to victoriously converge in Beiping. Chairman Guo Moruo delivered the opening address, pointing out that the task of the congress should be to summarize past experiences, plan future strategies, and effectively utilize literature and art as a powerful weapon to enhance revolutionary hatred of the enemy and increase enthusiasm for production (the opening address will be published separately). Subsequently, Mao Dun reported on the preparations for the congress, and Feng Naichao reported on the results of the representative qualification review. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De stepped onto the stage amidst warm applause and called on literary and art workers across the country to unite, strengthen their work, and welcome the new era of the people's democratic dictatorship (the full text will be published separately). Dong Biwu congratulated the congress on its success on behalf of the North China People's Government and the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau. He pointed out that the past view that literature and art could transcend class was incorrect. In a class society, class standpoints and class viewpoints cannot but be reflected in literature and art. He hoped that literary and art workers would recognize this issue, grasp the correct political direction, fully reflect the struggle of the Chinese people's revolution, express the people's thoughts and feelings, and, under the direction of Chairman Mao, do a good job in their current and future work. Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee, said excitedly in his speech that such a congress would have been impossible in the past. The fact that such a congress could be held today is due to the basic victory of the Chinese revolution, and it also shows how much the people value progressive literature and art. He said that the Kuomintang reactionaries blocked the path for writers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to go among the masses, while the liberated areas had a completely different environment. Therefore, literary and art workers in the liberated areas should not be arrogant, and writers who were in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the past should not be discouraged. Because the environment has changed now, the door to go among the masses is now open. He called on all literary and art workers to unite and give full play to the mobilizing and educational role of literature and art for the masses. Mobilize the masses to strive towards a certain goal, and educate the masses not to take detours in the revolutionary process. He said that this work is arduous, but we must strive to do it well and ensure that it is done well, and play our greatest strength in the construction of a New Democratic New China. Li Jishen spoke on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, explaining that in the past, reactionary rulers had persecuted progressive literary and art workers in every possible way, but now that the people's revolution has achieved basic victory, literature and art should cooperate with the overall nation-building work. Shen Junru spoke on behalf of the Democratic League, saying that this congress demonstrated the unprecedented great unity of literary and art workers across the country, and praised literary and art workers for having begun to unite with the people under the guidance of Chairman Mao. He hoped that the literary and art circles would carry forward the spirit of heroic struggle of the past, better serve the people, and work together to create a People's Democratic Republic. Ye Jianying extended congratulations to the congress on behalf of the CCP Beiping Municipal Committee, the Beiping Military Control Commission, and the Beiping Municipal People's Government, hoping that literary and art workers would use their efforts to eliminate the enemy in people's hearts—the remnants of feudal ideology, comprador ideology, and even fascist ideology. He said that if this work is done well, the establishment of a new society will be more guaranteed. Zhu Xuefan, Li Xiuzhen, Li Dequan, and Qian Junrui respectively represented the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Farmers' Organizations in the Liberated Areas, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, congratulating the opening and success of the congress. From the different perspectives of workers, peasants, women, and youth, they praised the contributions of revolutionary literary and art workers to the Chinese people's revolution in the past, and demanded that literary and art workers better serve the Chinese people. Li Jian, a representative of the Special Forces of the North China Military Region, presented a flag to the congress, which read: "Soldiers place infinite hopes on it." He also addressed the congress, saying: It is hoped that this congress, when comprehensively summarizing experiences, exchanging opinions, and determining policies and tasks, will pay attention to summarizing the experience of literature and art serving the soldiers, reflect more of the life of the troops, and improve the culture of the troops. The congress completed its opening ceremony in a solemn and enthusiastic atmosphere after four hours.
