　　A Story of a "Nandu-style" Pistol
    Sun Ruofeng
    One morning in the winter of 1941, near a small village on the banks of the Zhuolong River, our anti-Japanese guerrilla force of seventy or eighty people broke through the encirclement of a “mopping-up” team of over a thousand Japanese devils. They were divided into two echelons, taking turns covering the retreat.
    The battle took place in the riverbed. Crossing this open space to the Qianli embankment on the other side was three *li* away. The terrain was unfavorable to them. Although they were familiar with every earthen slope and ditch here, the good terrain was occupied by the enemy, leaving only this route.
    The enemies pursuing them continuously swept the ground with machine gun bullets, drawing arcs. Shells tore up the earth and flung it into the air, only to have it fall again. Cavalry was flanking them from the side, and infantry was also moving up. The enemy wanted to wipe out this guerrilla force.
    Several times, the enemy got very close, firing their guns while shamelessly shouting, "Eighth Route Armymen, you can't escape! Surrender your guns!"
    "I'll give you a bullet!" the soldiers angrily cursed, using bayonets and grenades to eliminate the enemies who rushed to the front, forcing those who lagged behind to roll back.
    As the battle raged, Section Chief Geng fell, bleeding from his head and abdomen. The messenger crawled over to carry him on his back.
    "You... you go down! I won't make it down. Such a heavy injury won't work."
    The messenger insisted on carrying him down.
    "Hurry down! I won't make it anyway. If you delay any longer, you won't be able to get away either."
    "Climb on my back! I can carry you." the messenger pleaded.
    At this moment, the messenger was also hit by a bullet in the leg.
    "Hurry down! I order you to hurry down! Don't worry about me!" Section Chief Geng, his body covered in bloody mud, twitched, blood washing away the dirt stuck to his wounds. He gritted his teeth and handed the document bag on his body to the messenger, weakly saying, "Tell the comrades to fight the Japanese well and avenge me."
    "The gun... let me take it down with me?!"
    "No, I still have use for it, I still have a breath left. Hurry down! I'll cover you!" Section Chief Geng, holding his Nandu-style pistol, turned his face towards the direction the enemy was coming from.
    The messenger cried and rolled down. In the fierce battle, the guerrillas finally broke through the enemy's encirclement and retreated to the Qianli embankment, and the enemy dared not pursue them any further. They had no choice but to seize three carts to haul away the corpses, put the wounded soldiers in trucks, and leave dejectedly.
    At dusk, our guerrilla force returned, and the wounded messenger led everyone to find Section Chief Geng's body.
    He was curled up with one leg bent, lying on the ground, his back riddled with holes by the enemy, still oozing black-red blood. Scattered around were many Nandu-style pistol shell casings.
    Everyone silently lifted him into the coffin.
    "This soil is quite new, it looks like something is buried inside!" Someone dug open the new soil under Section Chief Geng's remains, which was soaked in a large patch of blood, and unearthed the Nandu-style pistol he carried. Clearly, this was buried beneath him before he died, after he had used up all the bullets.
    "Lift!" everyone shouted in unison, and in this iron-like silence, they mournfully and respectfully carried Section Chief Geng's remains towards the martyrs' cemetery.
    At this time, the cold, pale moonlight had risen into the sky, solemnly illuminating this land washed by the blood of martyrs.

　　一枝“南都式”的故事
    孙若风
    一九四一年冬天的一个上午，在潴龙河畔的一个小村庄附近，我们一支七八十人的抗日游击队，突破了日本鬼子一千多人的一个“扫荡”队的包围，他们分成两个梯队，轮班掩护撤退。
    战斗在河身里进行，通过这一段开阔地，到对面的千里堤，有三里远；地形是不利于他们的，他们虽然熟悉这里的每一个土坡、沟壕，但是好的地形敌人都占领了，只有这一条路。
    追击他们的敌人，不停的用机枪弹在地上划着弧线，炮弹把地上的土掀起来抛到半空，又扔下来，骑兵从侧面包抄过来，步兵也上来了，敌人想把这支游击队消灭掉。
    好几次，敌人扑得很近了，一面放枪，一面还无耻的喊着说：“八路们，你们跑不了啦！交枪吧！”
    “老子交你个子弹头！”战士们愤怒的骂着，用刺刀和手榴弹把跑到前头的敌人消灭掉，跑的稍后的便滚回去了。
    战斗正在激烈的时候，耿科长倒下去了，头和肚子上都流出血来，通信员匍匐着来背他。
    “你……你下去吧！我不下去了，这么重的伤下去也不行了。”
    通信员一定要背下他去。
    “快下去吧！我横竖是不行了，再耽误一会连你也就下不去了。”
    “爬到我脊梁上来吧！我背的动你。”通信员恳求地说：
    这时候通信员腿上也中了一弹。
    “快下去！我命令你快下去！不要管我了！”耿科长沾了满身血泥的身体抽动着，血冲开了沾在伤口上的土流出来，他咬着牙把身上的文件袋交给通信员，无力地说：“就说我嘱咐同志们好好打日本，给我报仇。”
    “枪……让我带下去吧？！”
    “不，我还有用，我还有一口气呢，快下去！我掩护你！”耿科长握着他那枝南都式手枪，转过脸去，朝着敌人来的方向。
    通信员哭着滚下去，在激烈的战斗中，游击队终冲破了敌人包围圈，撤到了千里堤上，敌人就不敢再追。只好抓了三辆大车拉着死尸，把伤兵放在汽车上，垂头丧气地走了。
    黄昏，我们的游击队又回来了，负了伤的通信员领着大家找到耿科长的尸体。
    他圈着一条腿，伏在地上，脊梁上叫敌人扎了好些窟窿，还津着黑红的血，在四周，散乱着很多的南都式手枪弹壳。
    大家默默地把他抬到棺材里。
    “这土挺新，里头象埋着什么！”一个人刨开了耿科长遗体下的淌了一大片血的新土，刨出了他佩用的那枝南都式手枪。这，显然是在临死前，打完子弹后，埋在身下的。
    “起”，大家喊了一声号，便在这铁样的沉默里，悲哀而崇敬地把耿科长的遗体抬向烈士墓地。
    这时，冷得发白的月光已升到半空，庄严的照着这被烈士的血洗过的大地。
