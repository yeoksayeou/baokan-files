To run the People's Railways well, Minister Teng proposed that the following six problems must be solved: (1) Learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and summarize and promote the results of the actual implementation in the Northeast to the Northern and Southern Bureaus. Implement the spirit and essence of the responsibility system into action departments, so as to overcome the chaotic phenomenon of going beyond the organization, no one being responsible, isolated labor, and working independently through the organizational system of graded responsibility, everyone being responsible, fixed organization, and joint labor! We must break conservative ideas and become the actual masters of our own careers. (2) Establish technical operation standards. Only with standards can we universally carry out competitions. Competitions will produce new people and new standards, and continuously improve standards. Establish an economic accounting system, calculate costs, carry out a savings campaign, and increase capital accumulation. The source of our enterprise's capital accumulation is to mobilize all manpower and resources within the enterprise, use them rationally, create more productivity with less labor and resources, so that every employee can clearly understand the economic value generated by their labor results, and consciously reduce costs step by step. It is necessary to implement scientific management, improve the production system, improve technical equipment, reduce unnecessary personnel, expenses, and troublesome procedures. Everything must be scientifically calculated. A thriving and developing class should consider long-term plans when doing something or repairing a project, overcome all wasteful phenomena, and establish a reward system. (3) Cultivate talents. Cultivate thousands upon thousands of skilled technical cadres, various engineers and technicians from workers, staff, and young intellectuals. Without a large number of new-type talents, it is impossible to imagine building a people's railway network and accelerating China's industrialization. These people must not only have skilled technology and learn advanced experience from the Soviet Union, but also be familiar with Marxism-Leninism, understand the laws of national construction, and be far-sighted rather than blind. We currently have 360,000 employees, who need to learn on-site, turn the site into a university, and run training courses and refresher courses to improve everyone's culture. (4) The issue of unity. Unity is strength. The working class itself must be strongly united and unite with the staff, that is, all staff who work with their brains, so that they recognize that they rely on mental labor for their livelihood and are part of the working class. Recognize their own team, criticize their old and wrong ideas of belittling workers and belittling labor, liberate them from some or more bourgeois influences, unite with the peasants, unite with the workers of other enterprises, and eliminate all forms of reactionary residual forces from invading us. (5) The needs of the situation and development. The construction of China's People's Railways urgently needs unification. We are currently formulating various unified regulations for the national railways to oppose the bad tendency of independent kingdoms and working independently, so that the national railways can quickly embark on unification and regularization. (6) Pay attention to the welfare and life of employees. The main task of the livelihood department is to do a good job in this kind of welfare work. All department heads, especially Communist Party members, should always care about and solve the welfare, cultural, and recreational needs of employees.

At present, we urgently need to work hard to produce, step up learning, and use all means to accumulate funds to fight for the construction of a national railway network. We must realize that the working class and the Communist Party can overcome all difficulties. We have the wise leadership of the Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and Chairman Mao, and the experience created by the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe. We believe that the conditions are much better than those after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union. We need to integrate advanced experience, make it systematic, and strive to build an accurate, rapid, safe, economically efficient, and low-cost new type of people's railway network to serve the unlimited production cause of the Chinese people.

　　要办好人民铁道
  　须解决六个问题
    为要把人民铁道办好，滕部长提出须要解决以下六个问题：（一）学习苏联的先进经验，总结推广东北实际执行的成果到北方与南方各局，把负责制的精神和实质贯彻到行动部门中去，以按级负责，人人负责，固定编织，联合劳动的组织制度，克服那种超越组织，无人负责，孤立劳动各自为政的混乱现象！必须打破保守观念，成为自己事业实际上的主人。（二）建立技术作业标准，一切有了标准才能普遍展开竞赛，竞赛产生新人物，新标准，并不断的继续提高标准，建立经济核算制，计算成本开展节约运动，增加资金积累，我们企业资本积累来源是动员企业内部一切人力和资源，合理使用，以较少的劳力和资源，创造较多生产力，使每一个职工都能清楚自己劳动结果所产生的经济价值，一步步的自觉的减低成本费。要实行科学管理，改善生产制度，改善技术设备，减少不必要的人员、费用、麻烦手续，一切东西要科学计算，一个兴隆发展的阶级干一件事，修一件工程，都应从百年大计着想，克服一切浪费现象并建立奖励制。（三）培养人材，从工人、职员青年知识分子中，培养成千成万的熟练业务的技术干部，各种工程师技师，没有大批的新型人材，就不能设想可以建设人民铁道的铁路网，加速中国工业化，这些人不仅有熟练的技术与向苏联学习先进的经验，而且熟习马列主义，懂得国家建设的规律，有远见而不是盲目的，我们现有三十六万职工，要在现场学习，把现场变成大学校，办训练班补习班，使大家的文化都能提高一步。（四）团结问题，团结就是力量，工人阶级本队要强固的团结起来，进行团结职员，即脑力劳动者的一切职员，使他们认识他们是以脑力劳动为生活来源的，是工人阶级的一部分。认识自己的队伍，批判他旧的错误的轻视工人，轻视劳动的思想，使他们从某些或多或少的资产阶级影响下解放出来，与农民团结起来，和其他企业的工友们团结起来，并肃清一切形式的反动残余势力对我们的侵袭。（五）形势与发展的需要，中国人民铁道建设，急需统一，现正在制定全国铁道统一的各种规章，反对独立国各自为政的恶劣倾向，使全国铁路迅速走上统一与正规。（六）注意员工福利生活，生计部门主要任务就是作好这种福利事情，一切部门的负责人特别是共产党员，都应该经常关心和解决职工福利和文化娱乐的需要。
    现在迫切的须要我们努力生产，加紧学习，用一切办法积累资金，为建设全国铁路网而斗争，必须认识工人阶级与共产党是可以克服一切困难的。我们有中央、中央军委、毛主席的英明领导，苏联东欧新民主主义国家已创造的经验，我们相信比苏联十月革命后的条件好得多。我们需要综合先进的经验加以条理化，系统化，以求建立一个准确、迅速、安全、经济效率高、成本低新型的人民铁道网为中国人民不可限量的生产事业服务。
