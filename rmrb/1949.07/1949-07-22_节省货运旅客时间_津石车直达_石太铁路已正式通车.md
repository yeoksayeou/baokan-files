　　Saving Freight and Passenger Time
    Through Trains from Tianjin to Shijiazhuang
    Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway Officially Open to Traffic
    [This Dispatch from Tianjin] In order to save transportation time, facilitate freight transport, and eliminate the inconvenience of passengers changing trains, the Pingjin Railway Bureau has decided to change the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang service to a direct train, eliminating the need to change trains in Dezhou. This will be implemented from the 24th of this month. The train schedule is as follows: departing from Tianjin at 14:20 on the first day and arriving in Shijiazhuang at 7:16 on the second day. The train departing from Shijiazhuang will leave at 17:05 on the first day and arrive in Tianjin at 10:25 on the second day. The full fare for the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang route is 1,590 yuan.
    [This Dispatch from Tianjin] The heroic workers of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway overcame the flood and repaired all railway bridges, officially resuming traffic on the 15th of this month. The bridges on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway were originally temporary bridges made of wooden frames. The original plan was to replace all of them with permanent iron bridges by mid-July this year, but due to early rainfall this year, the temporary wooden bridges were washed away, resulting in a temporary interruption of traffic on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway.

　　节省货运旅客时间
    津石车直达
    石太铁路已正式通车
    【本报天津专电】平津铁路局为节省运输时间，并使货运畅通，免除旅客换车麻烦起见，特将津石通车改为直达车，不再在德县换车，订于本月二十四日起实施，其行车时间：第一日十四时二十分自天津开出，第二日七时十六分到石家庄，由石家庄开出者为第一日十七时零五分，第二日十时二十五分到津，津石全程票价一千五百九十元。
    【本报天津专电】石太铁路职工英勇的战胜水灾，修复全部铁桥并于本月十五日正式恢复通车。石太路各桥原为本排架成的临时桥，原计划于今年七月中旬全部改为正式铁桥，但由于今年降雨较早将代用木桥冲坏，因而石太路交通曾一度中断。
