How to Use Sprayers and Dusters
    Chuan Shengfa

Sprayers and dusters are the main tools for spraying pesticides to prevent and control diseases and pests. Without these tools, relying solely on manual control would not only be time-consuming but also have minimal effect. Therefore, sprayers and dusters are essential tools for applying pesticides in disease and pest control. However, it is crucial to understand how to use these two types of equipment properly to maximize their effectiveness. Otherwise, they can be easily damaged, and improper application can lead to pesticide damage or uneconomical results. Now, I will explain the methods of using and repairing them, hoping that everyone can follow these instructions. This will not only ensure their durability but also enhance their effectiveness.

    I. Single-Tube Sprayer – There are many types of sprayers, including automatic, semi-automatic, backpack, and single-tube sprayers. In North China, the most common type is the single-tube sprayer, also known as the bucket sprayer because the machine body must be placed in a bucket containing the pesticide solution during use. When using this type of sprayer, it is best to have two people operating it simultaneously. One person manages the machine body and pumps air, while the other handles the spraying work. The person managing the machine body should stand the machine body upright in the pesticide bucket, step on the footrest, and hold the handles with both hands, moving them up and down to force the pesticide solution from the pressure into the air chamber, then through the rubber tube and spray rod to be ejected. The person handling the spraying holds the spray rod and opens the switch after the pressure is sufficient to spray the pesticide solution onto the insects or crops. The person managing the machine body should observe the strength of the atomized droplets and adjust the pumping action accordingly to provide appropriate pressure. If the droplets are strong and powerful, and the plunger feels heavy when pressed down, stop operating to avoid excessive pressure and damage to the machine parts. After completing the spraying work, remove the machine body from the pesticide bucket, move the plunger to return the residual pesticide solution in the machine body to the bucket, and then repeatedly spray with clean water several times. After spraying out the internal water, store it in a dry place.

    If the sprayer is not used for a long time, minor problems such as water leakage often occur. People working in the fields can repair these problems at any time. Generally, prepare pliers, screwdrivers, chisels, machine oil, etc., for use during repairs to avoid delaying the spraying time and hindering pest control work. The most common problems and their repair methods are:

    (1) Leaking at Joints – Check the leather gaskets at the leaking points. If they are loose or damaged, replace them with new ones.

    (2) Nozzle Blockage – Unscrew the nozzle and wash away the sediment in the screw grooves and small holes with water.

    (3) Switch Leakage – The switch often leaks due to loose cap or damaged stem packing. Tighten the cap. If it still leaks after tightening, unscrew the cap, wrap a small amount of cotton yarn around the stem, and then cover the cap.

    (4) Cylinder Spitting Water – If the gasket is dry or worn out after prolonged friction, the cylinder will spit water. First, tighten the gasket nut and try again. If it still leaks, remove the gasket nut by turning it along the screw, wrap a small amount of cotton yarn around the stem, cover the gasket nut, and tighten it. If the stem is difficult to pull up, loosen the gasket nut slightly to allow free movement and avoid water spitting.

    (5) Filter Screen Blockage – If there are settled pesticides or unclean water, the filter screen can easily become blocked. When repairing, remove the filter screen spring, loosen the filter screen, and brush off the sediment.

    II. Hand-Crank Duster – Currently, the dusters used in North China are all hand-crank dusters. Most of this type of duster consists of a powder container, a crank on the right side, and a powder-blowing fan on the left side. The linkage and other precision components are sealed inside the machine casing. Users must not open it to avoid damage. Before spraying, install the crank, and then tightly connect the two sections of the powder delivery pipe and the nozzle cover to the fan outlet with screws. The fan and powder delivery pipe can be rotated to various angles to suit the needs of powder spraying. Then, open the door on the powder container, add the powder. Usually, fill the powder about a little over half. Then close it again. On the left side of the powder container, there are markings such as OFF—5—10—15—20, and a silver pointer that can be moved. This is the device for adjusting the amount of powder sprayed. The person spraying can freely move this pointer to adjust the amount of powder sprayed. Normally, when the pointer is set to "5," the amount of powder sprayed per acre is about one jin. When set to "10," the amount of powder sprayed per acre is two jin. When set to "15," it is three jin, and when set to "20," it is four jin. Therefore, if you need to spray two jin of powder per acre, set it to "10." If you need to spray one jin per acre, set it to "5." After all the equipment of the duster is ready, use the spraying strap to carry the duster on your back and use your right hand to crank the handle at a speed of about thirty cranks per minute. Do not crank too much or too little.

    Hand-crank dusters rarely have problems. However, after use, it is most important to store it in a dry place. Otherwise, if it is too humid, the powder will not be sprayed evenly during spraying.

　　喷雾器和喷粉器的使用法
    传胜发
    喷雾器和喷粉器是喷撒药剂防治病虫的主要器具，没有这种器具，只用人工防治，不但太费时间，而且效果也是很小，所以喷雾器和喷粉器是防治病虫施用药剂上的必需用具，不过这两种器械使用的方法，一定要会用，才能发出它的效能，不然的话，不但容易损坏，而且施用不当的时候反而容易发生药害或不合乎经济条件，现在把使用和修理的方法说明在下，希望大家能依照所说的方法去使用，非但能经久不坏而且效力也大。
    一、单管喷雾器——喷雾器的种类很多，有的自动式，有的半自动式，有的背负式，也有的单管式，在华北最多的一种是单管式，也有人叫它水桶喷雾器，这是因为使用的时候必须把机身放在装有药剂的水桶里头的缘故，这种喷雾器使用的时候，最好二人同时操作，一个人管理机身及打气，一个人管理喷药工作，管机身的要把机身直立在药桶里头用脚踏住踏脚，两手握住把手，上下抽动，使药水由压力压入气室，再经过橡皮管喷杆而射出，管喷药的手执喷杆，等压力加足即把开关打开向虫体或作物上从事喷射药液，管机身的要看喷出雾点的力量大小，再抽动塞杆，以便供给适当的压力，假设雾点强而有力，塞杆下压感觉沉重的时候，就应当停止操作，以免压力过大而损坏机件，喷射工作完毕以后，把机身提出药桶，抽动塞杆，把机身中的残留药液回射桶内，然后再用清水反复喷射几次，把内部的水喷完后，把它放在干燥的地方存放起来就行。
    喷雾器如果经久不用，常常会发生漏水等小的毛病。这种毛病，田间工作的人可以随时修理，普通要备用老虎钳、螺丝旋、凿、机械油等，以备修理的时候应用，以免有误喷药的时间防碍治虫工作，普通最好发生的障碍和它修理的方法是：
    （一）接头漏水——检查漏水地方的皮垫，若是有脱落或损坏的情形，可以另换一个。
    （二）喷头阻塞——把喷头旋下来，把螺丝沟和小洞里头的沉淀物用水洗掉就行。
    （三）开关漏水——开关时常因为帽盖松弛或塞柄缠纱损坏的关系，以致发生漏水的毛病，应当把帽盖旋紧，倘旋紧以后仍然漏水的话，再把帽盖旋开，沿塞柄另外缠以少许棉纱，盖上帽盖就可应用。
    （四）唧筒冒水——如果遇到垫塞物干燥或经久磨擦损坏的时候，唧筒就有冒水的毛病，可以先把压垫螺帽拧紧，再行试用，如果仍然漏水，可把压垫螺帽顺着螺丝取出，另以棉纱少许顺着塞杆缠绕，盖上压垫帽而拧紧之，如塞杆上提沉重，则将压垫帽稍松，如此即可自由抽动而免冒水之弊。
    （五）滤网阻塞——遇有沉淀之药剂或不清洁的水，很容易使滤网阻塞，修理的时候，把压滤网的弹簧取下，松出滤网，刷除沉淀物就行。
    二、手摇喷粉器——目前华北所用的喷粉器，全是手摇喷粉器，这种喷粉器的大部分是装粉器，右边是摇手，左边是吹粉风扇，其联动机等精细机件，都是固封在机匣里头，使用者万不可打开，以免损坏，喷药以前，先把摇手装好，再把输粉管二节和喷口覆罩用螺丝紧接在风扇口上，这风扇和输粉管，可以活动向各种角度旋转，以适合喷粉的需要，再将装粉器上的门打开，把药粉加入，普通药粉加满一多半就行，然后重新闭上，装粉器左侧有ＯＦＦ—５—１０—１５—２０等字样，并有银色可以拨动的指针一个，那是调节喷粉量的设备，喷粉的人可以随意拨动这个指针，来调节喷粉量数的多寡，普通指针拨到“５”的时候，一亩地的喷粉量，大约是一斤，拨到“１０”的时候，一亩地的喷粉量是二斤“１５”的时候是三斤，“２０”的时候是四斤，所以你若每亩喷粉二斤的话，就拨到“１０”的地方，每亩要喷一斤的话，就拨到“５”的地方，喷粉器一切装备完毕以后，就可用喷粉带把喷粉器背在背上，用右手来摇动摇手，速度每分钟摇三十摇就行，不要太多，也不要太少。
    手摇喷粉器的毛病很少发生，不过用完以后，最重要的是要把它放在干燥的地方，不然如果太潮，喷粉的时候，粉末的喷出便容易不均匀。
