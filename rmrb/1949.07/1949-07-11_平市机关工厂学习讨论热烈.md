　　Ping City Government Offices and Factories
　　Enthusiastic Learning and Discussion
　　[Further News] The government offices, state-owned factories, and enterprises of Ping City are also actively studying Chairman Mao's important work. During the study, everyone generally understood the significance of the people's democratic dictatorship. Staff members of various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government expressed that they must study this document carefully. Chao Jinwen of the Municipal Government Administrative Office said: "The enemy thinks that we have no way to manage the country and will not succeed; but they have forgotten that we have the weapon of Marxism-Leninism, which can overcome everything. We must study this document carefully and learn everything we should learn according to Chairman Mao's instructions, especially economic work." Cadres in District One are also studying this document. After a discussion, the first group of the 70th Ordnance Factory wrote in their discussion report: "This dictatorship, this autocracy, is not the dictatorship or autocracy of one person, but the dictatorship of the broad masses of the people over the reactionaries." Lu Mao, an old worker who participated in the "February 7th" General Strike, said: "The victory of the revolution was won by our proletariat and the broad masses of the people with blood, sweat, and armed struggle. Chairman Mao said that we should implement 'people's democratic dictatorship.' Yes, we must have democracy within the people, and we must implement dictatorship over the reactionaries. We must never let the reactionaries speak and act recklessly again." The employees of the Ping City Telecommunications Bureau are also studying the document with unusual enthusiasm. After Comrade Liu Ziju of the General Trade Union gave a detailed explanation to all employees, various study groups solicited the employees' thoughts. The opinion of the eighth group said: "In the past, we always felt that since it is democracy, why should there be dictatorship, and since there is dictatorship, why is there democracy? It turns out that the people's democratic dictatorship is democratic towards the people and dictatorial towards the enemy." Another group of employees in the bureau realized the relationship between revolution and international assistance. The report of the third group of the first team stated: "Imperialists will not help us; only nations that treat us equally and oppressed nations will help each other." Zhang Fengxi of the seventh group wrote: "Because the Communist Party can explain that it will eventually disappear with the class and with the state power, it can be seen that the Communist Party is not forming factions for personal gain, but is indeed a party for liberating the Chinese people and building a new China."
　　Democratic figures in Ping City, including Ma Xulun, Tan Pingshan, Li Dequan, Deng Chumin, Xu Deheng, and writers Mao Dun, Zheng Zhenduo, Tian Han, and Ding Ling, also published their thoughts and poems in various newspapers, supporting Chairman Mao's July 1st article.

　　平市机关工厂
  　学习讨论热烈
    【又讯】平市各机关、公营工厂、企业也纷纷学习毛主席这一重要著作。在学习中，大家首先是普遍地明白了人民民主专政的意义。市政府各局处的工作人员都表示一定要好好学习这个文件。市政府行政处晁锦文说：“敌人认为我们管理国家没办法，成不了功；但是他们忘记了我们有着马克思列宁主义的武器，便能战胜一切。我们一定要好好研究这篇文件，按照毛主席的指示，学会一切应学会的东西，尤其要学会经济工作。”一区干部们也正在学习这一文件。七十兵工厂第一小组讨论后，他们在讨论汇报上写道：“这个专制、独裁并不是某一个人的专制独裁，而是广大的人民对反动派的专制独裁”。曾参加过“二七”大罢工的老工人路懋说：“革命的胜利是咱无产阶级和广大人民用血，用汗，用武装斗争得来的。毛主席说咱们要实行‘人民民主专政’，是的，咱们人民内部要民主，对反动派要实行专政，绝不让反动派再来乱说乱动。”平市电讯局职工学习该文件也异常热烈，自总工会刘子久同志在该局对全体职工详细讲解后，各学习小组即征询职工们的感想。第八组的意见说：“过去我们总觉得既然是民主，为何还要专政，既然专政，为什么还有民主？原来人民民主专政是对人民是民主的，对敌人是专政的”。该局另一部分职工则又因此体会到革命与国际援助的关系问题，第一区队第三小组的报告上写道：“帝国主义者是不会帮助我们的，只有以平等待我之民族与被压迫的民族才会彼此援助。”第七组张凤翕写道：“由于共产党能自己说明自己将来是要随阶级、随国家权力而消灭，可见得共产党不是营私结党，而确实是为了解放中国人民，建设新中国的党”。
    在平民主人士马叙伦、谭平山、李德全、邓初民、许德珩及作家茅盾、郑振铎、田汉、丁玲等亦在各报发表感想与诗文，拥护毛主席的七一论文。
