Fellow countrymen, brothers and sisters, railway workers, engineers, employees, technicians, and all staff serving on the railways across the country!

Due to the People's Liberation Army's full-scale advance, Nanjing, the old nest of the Kuomintang reactionaries, has been liberated. Shanghai, China's largest commercial port, has been liberated. Major cities such as Hangzhou, Nanchang, Wuhan, and Xi'an have also been liberated in the PLA's courageous advance. The people have already achieved victory in the war, and the day of national liberation is not far off. The rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries has been declared dead in the face of the people. The Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference has victoriously opened and is preparing all necessary work to convene the New Political Consultative Conference in the near future and establish the government of the People's Democratic Republic of China. The revolutionary situation is developing so rapidly that the people across the country are very happy about it.

Along with the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, railways across the country have successively been transferred from the hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries back to the hands of the people. The Northeast Railway has been built by the people for three years, the Northern Railway has also been firmly grasped in the hands of the people, and the Southern Railways are successively returning to the hands of the people. Soon, all the railways across the country will return to the hands of the people, which, like the national victory, is beyond doubt.

Looking back at the history of Chinese railways, which began construction in 1868 (the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign in the Qing Dynasty), it has been 81 years. The vast majority of these 81 years of railway history is a history of national humiliation and loss of sovereignty. With China being so large, there are only nearly 27,000 kilometers of railways to date. Although Mr. Sun Yat-sen once proposed a plan to build 100,000 miles of railways, during the 22 years of rule by the Kuomintang reactionaries, not only was it not realized, but it deteriorated. In the autumn of 1931, the country had a total of 15,000 kilometers of railways. By the time of the July 7th Incident in 1937, it had decreased to 14,441 kilometers. When Wuhan and Guangzhou fell, it further decreased to 11,415 kilometers. After Hunan and Guangxi fell, there were only 3,317 kilometers left. By 1945, there were only 1,209 kilometers left. In April 1946, 200 kilometers of lines were restored. Before the surrender of Japanese imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries only retained more than 1,400 kilometers of railways. After the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang reactionaries also drafted a plan to build 8,000 kilometers of lines in five years, but in reality, nothing was implemented. Moreover, the vast majority of these railways in China were built under the supervision and planning of foreign banking groups and foreign engineers. Their purpose was not for China's prosperity and strength, not to transform China from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, and not for the benefit of the Chinese people. On the contrary, it was for the benefit of imperialism, to further colonize China, to facilitate the exploitation of the Chinese people's blood and sweat and the export of Chinese agricultural raw materials, and to facilitate the political, economic, and military aggression against China. Therefore, when the claws of Japanese imperialism reached into China, the coastal railways of China were the first to be lost, followed by the central railways. Only a short 1,000 kilometers of railways remained. The Kuomintang reactionaries were not building railways for the benefit of the people. They were dependent on imperialism and facilitated the attack on the liberated areas, making the railways a tool for oppressing and slaughtering the people. The Kuomintang reactionaries also demonstrated a corrupt, incompetent, and spendthrift style in the management of the railways, which led to a reduction in the technical standards of the railways and a significant weakening of the railway's effectiveness. They adhered to old conventions without any creation or construction.

But once it returned to the hands of the people, it was completely different. With the warm support and active assistance of the people, and with the hard work of all railway workers, managing and caring for their own railways as masters, working hard under extremely difficult conditions with a lack of materials and no foreign aid, giving full play to the people's wisdom, creativity, and ability, they put forward the slogan that "wherever the People's Liberation Army advances, the railway will be built." And in fact, it is indeed the case. The people's railways have made preliminary achievements, especially the three years of construction of the Northeast People's Railway, which has created many new records and opened the glorious first page of the people's railway.

According to statistics, there are a total of 26,922 kilometers of railways in the country (including Taiwan and Hainan Island), of which 11,066 kilometers are in the Northeast region, 8,454 kilometers are in the Northern region (north of the Yangtze River), and 7,402 kilometers are in the Southern region (including Taiwan and Hainan Island). A total of 15,710 kilometers have been restored to traffic after liberation, of which 9,971 kilometers are in the Northeast. Over the past three years, overcoming various difficulties and working hard, collecting waste materials, and donating equipment, a total of 5,700 kilometers of lines have been restored, 6,182,000 new sleepers have been replaced, 507,500 cubic meters of ballast have been filled, 40 large bridges have been repaired, 319 medium-sized bridges have been repaired, 412 temporary repairs have been made, and 798 locomotives have been repaired. In the Northern region, 4,579 kilometers of lines have been opened to traffic after liberation. This year, it is planned to repair 3,900 kilometers, of which 1,193 kilometers have already been repaired. From Kaifeng to Luoyang, and from Zhengzhou to Laotian'an, a total of 330 kilometers, were repaired by mobilizing 2,500 workers in 60 days, with an average of 5.5 kilometers repaired per day. From Jinan to Yanzhou, 156 kilometers, were repaired in 40 days. On the Shide Line, 180 kilometers, with all the rails removed and the roadbed, bridges, and all buildings completely destroyed, the farmers used handcarts and carts to transport sleepers and rails from hundreds of miles away to the railway line, and it was repaired in four months. On the Jinpu Line, from Chenguantun to Sangzidian, 274 kilometers, there were often 2,000 carts transporting materials day and night, and it was repaired in just 50 days. On the Jiaoji Line, the earthwork of 170,000 cubic meters of the roadbed from Fangzi to Guhe was repaired by 120,000 civilian workers (calculated by work) along the line within ten days. The line from Zhuozhou to Baoding was repaired and opened to traffic in 50 days. The line from Yuci to Taiyuan was repaired and opened to traffic in three days. The Jinpu Railway, which had been stopped for three years, has been directly opened to traffic. On July 1st, the Huaihe River Bridge will be completed, and it will be possible to travel from Manzhouli in Northeast China to Jinghu in the south. The rapid repair of the people's railway is a manifestation of the strength of the people, indicating that this is only possible when the people manage the railway themselves.

In management, due to the enthusiasm of all employees, especially the enthusiasm of the workers, and the wisdom and strength of the masses, a system of personal responsibility for machines, tools, and all work has been established, which greatly improves efficiency and exceeds the standards of the puppet Manchukuo and the Kuomintang reactionaries. For example, replacing the shift system with the locomotive crew responsibility system greatly improved the quality and efficiency of locomotives. In the Northeast region, the locomotives adopted a time-based inspection system during the enemy and puppet period, with an inspection every six months and an average mileage of 33,000 kilometers. We implemented a mileage-based inspection system, which has reached an average of 50,000 kilometers per inspection, exceeding the period of enemy and puppet rule by about 50%. The individual heroic locomotive "Iron Ox" pioneered 106,000 kilometers of safe mileage without inspection, and locomotive No. 884 broke through 110,000 kilometers, creating a new record for locomotive mileage in China.

In terms of driving speed, the general standard has exceeded the standard of the enemy and puppet period. That is, in the newly liberated Tianjin traffic speed, from five hours to two hours and twenty-five minutes, exceeding the highest record of two hours and twenty-seven minutes during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries.

Recently, the locomotive traction test from Tianjin to Zhengzhou, the traction was 2,200 metric tons, the conversion rate was 49.1 vehicles, the total length of the train was 574 meters, and the maximum speed was 63 kilometers, which was successful. Compared with the standard traction of 1,700 metric tons in the past, the conversion rate of 43 vehicles, and the maximum speed of 40 kilometers, it has increased by 30%. This greatly improves the use of locomotive energy and increases transportation power. Over the past three years, Northeast Railway employees have invented and created 281 kinds of materials in an all-round way, totaling 95,793 pieces, transformed 169 kinds, totaling 27,551 pieces, saved 724 kinds, totaling 45,810,000 pieces, and collected 1,024 kinds from the ruins, totaling 2,456,983 pieces.

The above simple partial numerical records are unprecedented records in the history of Chinese railways, and are the creations and achievements since the establishment of the people's railway.

These facts prove that only when the railway belongs to the people, when the people manage the railway themselves, when the working class leads the people's railway, and only when all employees become the masters of their own railway, can the railway be managed well and have development and a future.

Today, our traffic kilometers are only 15,710 kilometers, and the number of people's railway employees is only 360,000. Soon after the national liberation, there will be no more than 27,000 kilometers of lines and 400,000 railway employees. We cannot be proud and complacent because of this. This is just the first page of the construction of the people's railway, and this is just the beginning of the greater task of the construction of the people's railway.

Our main task at present is to ensure military supply and eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries. We must do a good job in railway work closely following the development of the military, overcome all difficulties, and mobilize the strength of all employees to quickly restore the lines, and continue to realize the requirement that "wherever the People's Liberation Army advances, the railway will be built." After the national liberation, in order to transform the motherland from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, and build a new democratic China that is independent, free, peaceful, unified, and strong, it is necessary to greatly develop the construction of the people's railway. With a country of 475 million people, only 27,000 kilometers of railways, more than 360,000 railway employees, and only 4,000 engineers in the country are far from enough. We hope that in a considerable period of time, we will plan new lines according to the interests of the Chinese people, develop a new democratic economy, and strengthen the foundation of national defense. We must build the Yangtze River Railway Bridge, which has never existed in Chinese history, rebuild the Yellow River Bridge, and build several huge east-west and north-south trunk lines to develop the people's railway network by one or even ten times. Only in this way can it meet the economic requirements of the new democratic China and complete the task of railway transportation required by the economy. Moreover, the plan for the five years from 1950 to 1954 should be to completely repair all the old railways in the country to reach the highest standards of the enemy and puppet period, restore all the double lines and electrical equipment of the original railways, and completely restore the old east-west and north-south trunk lines, and require technical equipment that exceeds the pre-war period. At the same time, in order to build industrial bases in the Northwest and Southwest and strengthen national defense, about 10,000 kilometers of new lines should be built.

The task of building the people's railway is huge and glorious. With the support of the broad masses, the efforts of all railway workers, the leadership of the soon-to-be-established government of the People's Democratic Republic of China, and the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao, I believe that it is possible to complete the glorious and great task given by the people.

Therefore, our railway workers, engineers, employees, technicians, and all staff serving on the railways must work hard, constantly invent and create, overcome all difficulties, strengthen technical, cultural, ideological, and political learning, and make every employee a worker armed with the consciousness of the proletarian revolution, serving the people with unparalleled enthusiasm, and building the people's railway.

Therefore, we must absorb the experience of advanced countries, the socialist Soviet Union, in managing and building railways, learn from advanced countries, and also learn technology from the enemy, oppose conservatism, complacency with the status quo, and self-satisfaction.

At the same time, we must also unite like a harmonious family, wage a resolute struggle against the remaining forces of the reactionaries, saboteurs, and hidden spies, and fight against all bad tendencies such as corruption, degeneration, and bureaucracy.

Let us bravely accept the glorious task of building the people's railway and transform our motherland into an industrially advanced country connected by a vast railway network. (People's Railway Newspaper)

　　中国人民革命军事委员会铁道部
  　滕部长向全国人民广播词
    全国父老兄弟姊妹，全国铁路的工人、工程师、从业员、技术员、一切在铁路上服务的职工们！
    由于人民解放军的全线进军，国民党反动派的老巢南京被解放了，中国第一大商埠上海解放了，杭州、南昌、武汉、西安等各大城市亦均在解放军的奋勇前进中解放了，人民已经取得了战争的胜利，全国解放的日子为期不远，国民党反动派的统治在人民面前已经宣告灭亡，新政治协商会议筹备会已胜利开幕，正在准备各项必要的工作，以便在最近期间召开新政治协商会议，成立中华人民民主共和国政府。革命形势发展得如此迅速，这是全国人民都非常高兴的事情。
    随着人民解放军的胜利前进，全国铁道亦相继从国民党反动派的手中转回到人民手里来，东北铁道已经由人民建设了三年了，北方铁道亦已牢固地掌握在人民手中，南方各铁路亦相继回到人民手中，不久全国铁道将全部回到人民手中，这和全国的胜利一样是毫无疑义的。
    回溯中国自公历一八六八年即满清同治七年开始建筑铁路以来，迄今已有八十一年的历史，这八十一年的铁路历史绝大部分是丧权辱国的历史，以中国如此之大，至今仅有将近两万七千公里的铁路，孙中山先生虽曾提出过修建十万英里铁路的计划，在国民党反动派执政的二十二年中，不但没有能够实现，相反的每况愈下，在一九三一年秋，全国铁路共有一万五千公里线路。至一九三七年七七事变时，减少到一万四千四百四十一公里了，到武汉广州沦陷时，再减到一万一千四百十五公里，湖南广西沦陷后，仅有三千三百一十七公里了。到一九四五年，就只剩下了一千二百零九公里了，在一九四六年四月曾恢复了二百公里线路，截止日本帝国主义投降前，国民党反动派只保有一千四百多公里的铁路线，在日本投降后，国民党反动派亦曾拟过五年中修建八千公里线路的计划，实际上一点亦未实行，而中国的这些铁路修筑，绝大部分是在外国银行团及外国工程师的监督计划下修筑的，他们的目的不是为了中国的富强，不是为了使中国由落后的农业国变成为先进的工业国，不是为了中国人民的利益，相反的是为了帝国主义的利益，是为了使中国更殖民地化，是为了便于榨取中国人民的血汗便于榨取中国的农业原料的输出，是为了便于在政治上、经济上、军事上侵略中国的目的，因此当日本帝国主义的魔爪伸入中国的时候，中国沿海的铁路就首先丧失了，接着中部的铁路亦相继丧失，只剩下了短短的千余公里铁路，而国民党反动派则更不是为人民利益来修建铁路，他是为了对于帝国主义的依赖，为了便于进攻解放区，使铁路成为压迫屠杀人民的工具，而国民党反动派在铁路的管理上亦同样的表现了腐败无能的败家子的作风，使得铁路的技术水准降低，铁路的效能大大减弱，墨守成规，毫无创造与建树。
    但一经转回到人民手中，就大不相同，在人民的热烈支持和积极帮助下，在全体铁路职工的努力工作下，以主人翁的姿态来管理爱护自己的铁路，在极端困难缺乏器材而毫无外援的困难条件下，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，发挥了人民的智慧、创造和能力，提出了人民解放军打到哪里、铁路就修到哪里的口号，而事实上也就是如此，人民的铁道已经有了初步的成绩，特别是东北人民铁道的三年建设，创造了不少新的纪录，展开了人民铁道光荣的第一页。
    根据统计，全国共有铁路（包括台湾海南岛在内）二万六千九百二十二公里，内东北区有铁路一万一千零六十六公里，北方区（长江以北）有八千四百五十四公里，南方区（包括台湾海南岛）有七千四百零二公里。经解放后恢复通车的共有一万五千七百一十公里，内东北通车的就有九千九百七十一公里，三年来克服种种困难，奋勇工作，搜集废料，献纳器材，共计恢复了五千七百公里线路，更换新枕木六百一十八万二千根，充实道碴五十万七千五百立方公尺，修复大型桥梁四十座，中型桥梁三一九座，临时修复四百十二处，修复机车七百九十八台。北方区解放后通车线路已有四千五百七十九公里，今年计划修复三千九百公里，现已修复了一千一百九十三公里，开封至洛阳，郑州至老田庵共计三三零公里，动员二千五百工人，经过六十天修成，每天平均修五·五公里，济南至兖州一五六公里，经四十天修复。石德线的一八零公里，在铁轨全部搬走、路基桥梁及所有建筑物全部平毁的情况下，由农民从百里以外，用手推车、大车把枕木铁轨送到铁路线上，经四个月即修好。津浦线陈官屯至桑梓店二七四公里，经常有两千辆大车昼夜运输材料，仅五十天即修复。胶济线坊子至固河的路基十七万立方公尺的土工，由沿线用了十二万个民工（以工计）十天之内修复。五十天修复涿州到保定的线路通车。三天修复了榆次至太原通车。而停止了三年的津浦路已直达通车，七月一日淮河大桥竣工，即可北起东北满洲里、南达京沪通车了。南方区解放后通车的现已有一千一百六十公里，全国民党反动派如何疯狂地破坏线路，炸毁桥梁，在人民的积极支持帮助下，全体职工日以继夜的工作下，都将在短时期内恢复他。京沪路五月二十七日枪声刚息，我第一列车即到达上海北站，二十八日即正式通车营业，沪杭路已车船接运通车了。由郑州直通武汉，由济南直通青岛，由平津直通京沪，均可于七月上旬开始营业，人民铁路之迅速修复，是人民力量强大的表现，说明了只有在人民自己管理铁路的时候才有此可能。
    在管理上由于发挥了全体职工的积极性，特别是工人的积极性，发扬了群众的智慧和力量，建立了机器、工具，及一切工作的专人负责制，使得效率大大提高，超过了伪满及国民党反动派管理时期的标准，如以机车乘务负责制代替了轮班制，大大提高了机车的质量和效率，东北区机车在敌伪时期采取时间定检制，每六个月体检一次，平均走行公里三万三千公里，我们实行了按公里定检制，已达到平均五万走行公里军检一次，超过敌伪统治时期约百分之五十，个别英雄机车铁牛号首创十万六千安全走行公里未经军检，而八八四号机车突破了十一万走行公里，创造了中国机车走行公里的新纪录。
    在行车速度上一般均超过了敌伪时期的标准，即在新解放不久的平津通车速度，由五小时缩到二小时二十五分，超过了国民党反动派统治时期最高的两小时二十七分的纪录。
    最近由天津至郑州的机车牵引量试验，牵引量为二千二百公吨，换算率为四九·一辆，列车全长为五七四米，最高速度六三公里，获得成功，较已往敌伪之标准牵引量一千七百公吨，换算率四三辆，最高速度四零公里提高百分之三十。这就大大提高机车能率的使用，和增加了运输力量。东北铁路员工三年来在器材全面发明创造二八一种，计九五、七九三件，改造一六九种，计二七·五五一件，节约七二四种，计四千五百八十一万件，从废墟中搜集了一·零二四种计二百四十五万六千九百八十三件。
    以上这些简单的部分的数字记录，都是中国铁路史上未有的空前的纪录，是人民铁道建立以来的创造和成果。
    这些事实证明，只有在铁路归人民所有，人民自己管理铁路的时候，只有在工人阶级领导人民铁道的时候，只有在全体职工成为自己铁路的主人翁的时候，铁路才能管理得好，才能有发展，有前途。
    今天我们的通车公里，只有一万五千七百一十公里，人民铁路从业员只有三十六万人，不久全国解放亦不过是两万七千公里线路，和铁路从业员四十万人，我们不能因此而骄傲自满，这不过是人民铁道建设的第一页，这不过是人民铁道建设更伟大的任务的开始。
    我们目前的主要任务是为着保证军事供应，扫清国民党反动派的残余势力，必须紧随着军事的发展把铁路工作搞好，克服一切困难，发动全体职工的力量来迅速恢复线路，继续实现人民解放军打到哪里、铁路修到哪里的要求，当全国解放后，为着将祖国由落后的农业国变成先进的工业国，建设成为独立、自由、和平、统一和强盛的新民主主义的新中国，必须要大大开展人民铁道的建设工作，以四万万七千五百万人口的国家，仅只有两万七千公里的铁路，三十六万余铁路从业员，全国只四千个工程师，这是很不够的，我们希望在相当的一个时期内，要按照中国人民的利益，发展新民主主义经济与加强国防的基础来计划新线路，要修筑中国历史上所没有过的长江铁桥，重建黄河大桥，修筑几条东西的巨大干线，和南北干线，把人民的铁道网发展到一倍乃至十倍，这样才能适合新民主主义的新中国的经济要求，才能完成经济上要求铁道运输的任务，而且今后一九五○年至一九五四年，五年内的计划，应该在全国旧有铁路完全修复达到敌伪时期的最高标准，及恢复原有铁路的全部复线及电气设备完全恢复旧有东西以及南北的干线，而且要求超过战前的技术设备，同时为建设西北、西南工业基地及加强国防，应该新修约一万余公里的线路。
    人民铁道的建设任务是巨大而光荣的，在广大的群众支持下，在全体铁路职工的努力下，在行将成立中华人民民主共和国政府的领导下，在以毛主席为首的共产党的领导下，我相信是可以完成人民所给予的光荣伟大的任务的。
    因此我们铁路工人、工程师、从业员、技术员以及一切在铁路上服务的职工们，必须要努力工作，不断的发明创造，克服一切困难，加强技术、文化、思想及政治的学习，作到每一个职工都以无产阶级革命的意识武装起来的工作者，以无比的热忱为人民服务，建设人民的铁道。
    因此我们必须吸收先进国家社会主义苏联的管理与建设铁路经验，向先进国家学习，同时也要向敌人学习技术，反对保守满足现状，反对自满自足。
    同时我们还必须团结的象一个和睦的大家庭一样，向反动派残余势力破坏分子，潜伏的特务分子作坚决的斗争，向一切不良的倾向贪污腐化官僚主义作斗争。
    我们英勇的来接受这建设人民铁道的光荣任务，将我们的祖国变成为有广大铁路网连贯起来的工业先进国。　（人民铁道报社）
