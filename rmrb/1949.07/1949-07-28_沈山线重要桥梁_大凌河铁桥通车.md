　　Important Bridge on the Shenshan Line
  　Daling River Railway Bridge Opens to Traffic
　　[This newspaper reports] The rebuilt Jinzhou Daling River Railway Bridge was fully completed on July 14th. This bridge was built by the British in 1899 and destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries when they attacked the Northeast in January 1948. It is one of the important bridges on the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan line, with a total length of 845 meters and 26 spans.
　　In order to complete the project before the flood season, the workers worked overtime, day and night, completing it 31 days ahead of schedule. A total of 26 steel beams, 27 bridge piers and abutments, and 11 bridge pier foundations were repaired, consuming 136,000 workdays over 119 days.
　　During the construction process, thanks to the workers' high degree of labor enthusiasm, they overcame difficulties in climate and tools. They laid a temporary line next to the bridge to replace machinery to erect the steel beams. What was originally estimated to take 50 days, they completed in 25 days. By mixing cement and transporting materials, they saved more than 2,000 workdays. At the most intense stage of the work, they built two and a half six-foot-high bridge piers in 12 hours and erected three steel beams in one day. The tight schedule saved 20,000 workdays. The No. 3 bridge pier was just repaired, and only five hours later, upstream floods came. If they hadn't been so focused, it would have affected the entire project.
　　On July 15th, a completion and opening ceremony was held on the banks of the Daling River. When the locomotive, pulling the carriages, passed through the decorated archway with colorful flags and drove onto this brand-new railway bridge, people cheered and applauded in celebration.

　　沈山线重要桥梁
  　大凌河铁桥通车
    【本报讯】重建的锦州大凌河铁桥，已于七月十四日全部完工。这桥是一八九九年英国人修建的，一九四八年一月在国民党反动派进攻东北时所破坏，是沈（阳）山（海关）线重要桥梁之一，全长八四五公尺，共二十六孔。
    为争取在洪水期前完工，工人们加班加点，日夜赶修，比预定期限提前三十一天完成。共修复钢梁二十六架，桥墩桥台二十七座，桥墩基础十一座，经过一百十九天，用了十三万六千工。
    在建筑过程中，由于工人们高度的劳动热忱，克服了气候及工具上的困难。他们在桥旁铺修一条便线，代替机械，架完钢梁，本来要五十天，他们二十五天就完成。打洋灰、运料，节省两千多工。当工作最紧张时，在十二小时内打两个半六尺高的桥墩，一天架三个钢梁。这次工程时间抓的紧，节省了两万工。第三号桥墩刚修好，只有五小时的工夫，上游的洪水就来了，如果不是抓的紧就会影响整个工程。
    七月十五日在大凌河畔举行落成通车典礼，当机车拖着车厢，通过县旗结彩的牌楼，驶到这一崭新的铁桥上时，人们欢欣鼓掌庆祝。
