(Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 14th) Dalian's enterprises have mobilized workers to put forward rationalization proposals, which has greatly contributed to improving production. According to statistics from the Lushun-Dalian Federation of Trade Unions, in the past year, workers have put forward 1,426 rationalization proposals in production, and the labor value generated by these proposals amounted to 610 million Guan Dong currency. Since the beginning of this year, this work has been further developed. Many workers have experienced that simply relying on physical strength to increase production is limited, so everyone is using their brains and putting effort into inventions and creations. From November last year to April this year, the staff and workers of various factories of the Dalian Jianxin Industrial Company put forward more than 130 methods for improving production tools. Four workers in Hongchang Factory created an automatic medicine pressing machine, which increased the output by eight to nine times. Wang Dawu of Dalian Chemical Factory improved the manufacturing method of welding rods, increasing the output by 16 times. After listening to workers' rationalization suggestions, the Electrochemical Factory continuously reformed its machinery, equipment, and production, reducing costs by 15 percent. In order to promote the creativity of employees in production in an organized and led manner, Guanghua Electrical Factory established a "Soliciting Meritorious Service" (reward) committee in April this year. It collected more than 40 items of existing production issues that should be overcome or improved, calling on everyone to come up with solutions. After responding to the call, workers can present their opinions and modification methods to the committee. Once approved by the committee, they can be implemented. The materials needed are generally solved by workers using waste materials. The research time is generally stipulated as using spare time, but those with special difficulties or who are confident of solving a certain difficulty can be approved by the "Soliciting Meritorious Service" committee to help them solve the time and material problems. The committee also formulates different types of reward standards for various rationalization proposals.

　　大连各厂发动工人
  　提出合理化建议
  　一年产生价值六亿
    【新华社大连十四日电】大连各企业在职工中发动的合理化建议工作，对改进生产贡献甚大。据旅大职工总会统计，去年一年中，职工在生产上提出的合理化建议，达一千四百二十六件，由这些建议所产生的劳动价值达关东币六亿一千多万元。今年以来，这一工作更进一步开展。很多工人已体验到单凭体力猛干，提高产量是有限度的，所以大家开动脑筋，在发明创造上用功夫。大连建新工业公司各厂职工从去年十一月到今年四月的半年中，提出改进生产工具的办法有一百三十余件。宏昌工厂四个工人创造了自动压药机，产量提高八倍到九倍。大连化学工厂王大武改进了焊条的制造法，使产量提高十六倍。电化工厂因听取了工人的合理化建议，不断改造了机器装备与生产，使成本降低了百分之十五。为着有组织有领导地推动职工们在生产中的创造，光华电气工厂在今年四月成立了“招立功”（悬赏）委员会，将当前生产工作中存在的一些应克服或应改进的地方，搜集了四十多条，号召大家想办法。工人在应招后，即可向委员会陈述他的意见及改造办法，经委员会批准，即可实行。所需材料一般系由工人设法利用废物解决，研究时间一般规定为利用业余时间，但有特殊困难或确有把握能将某项困难解决者，可经“招立功”委员会批准，帮助其解决时间及材料问题。委员会并对各种合理化建议，拟定出不同种类的奖励标准。
