Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 11th: A dispatch from New York: Under the auspices of the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy, a "Celebrate New China - Support Peace’s Comrade-in-Arms" rally was held in New York on June 15th. Over ten thousand people attended. The conference passed a congratulatory telegram to the Chinese people and a resolution on China policy.

The congratulatory telegram stated: "We, progressive Americans, gathered in New York to celebrate New China - a comrade-in-arms of the American people in the common struggle to uphold peace, and to celebrate the inspiring achievements of the great Chinese people and the ever-victorious People's Liberation Army! We are Americans who oppose the American reactionaries' interference in China's internal affairs. We know that your great victory has strengthened world peace, national independence, and the sovereign integrity of all countries. All of these are threatened by greedy interventionists who do not represent the American people. Here, we extend to you the hand of brotherly love. The Chinese and American peoples have always been friends, and have a common concern in developing sound economic relations on the basis of recognizing China as an equal and independent country, no longer subject to semi-colonial exploitation. For the happiness of our own people, we Americans demand that the US government prepare to recognize the new government being established by the Chinese people, and immediately approve and encourage normal and mutually beneficial trade between the two countries. Your victory inspires all those who are fighting for freedom and peace. We pay our respects to you!"

The full text of the "Resolution on China Policy" passed by the "Celebrate New China - Support Peace’s Comrade-in-Arms" rally is as follows: A new era has come to China. Feudalism has been defeated, and the Chinese people are advancing courageously, undertaking the enormous task of creating a free country and establishing an economy that will raise their living standards. These goals do not threaten the welfare of the people of any other country in the slightest; in fact, their realization will make our peace more secure. Therefore, we resolve: for the sake of world peace and our own more stable and prosperous economic interests, we pass a resolution urging our authorities in Washington: 1. To prepare to formally recognize the new government being established by the Chinese people; 2. To approve and encourage normal and mutually beneficial trade with China; 3. To avoid any form of interference, and to implement sincere cooperation with the Chinese people in their efforts to build a modern country and society for themselves. We further resolve: that copies of this resolution be sent to the President, the Department of State, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

    电贺中国人民并通过“对华政策决议”
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】纽约航讯：在民主远东政策委员会的主持之下，六月十五日在纽约召开了“庆祝新中国——拥护和平的战友”大会。与会者万余人。大会通过致中国人民的贺电和关于对华政策的决议。
    大会贺电称：“我们，进步的美国人，在纽约集会，庆祝新中国——美国人民在拥护和平的共同斗争中的战友，欢庆伟大的中国人民和常胜的解放军的令人振奋的成就！我们是反对美国反动派干涉中国内政的美国人，我们知道你们的伟大胜利加强了世界和平、民族独立和各国的主权完整。而这些都受到贪婪的不能代表美国人民的干涉主义者的威胁。在这里，我们向你们伸出兄弟友爱的手。中国人民和美国人民一向是朋友，对于在承认中国为一个平等自主的、不再受半殖民地剥削的国家的基础上，发展健全的经济关系，有着共同的关心。为了我们自己人民的幸福，我们美国人要求美国政府准备承认中国人民正在建立中的新政府，并且立即批准及鼓励两国之间进行正常与互利的贸易。你们的胜利鼓舞着一切为自由、和平而斗争的人们。我们谨向你们致敬！”
    “庆祝新中国——拥护和平的战友”大会通过的“关于对华政策的决议”全文如下：中国的新时代已经来临，封建主义已被击败，中国人民正在奋勇前进，进行这样一个巨大的工作，创造一个自由的国家，并且建立一种将要提高他们的生活标准的经济。这些目标，丝毫不威胁其他任何国家人民的福利；事实上，这些目标的实现，会使我们的和平更有把握。因此，我们决议：为了世界和平和我们自己的更为稳定与繁荣的经济利益，我们通过决议，力促我们的华盛顿当局：一，准备正式承认中国人民正在建立的新政府；二，批准并鼓励对中国的正常而互利的贸易；三，避免任何方式的干涉，而对中国人民为他们自己建立一个现代国家和社会的努力，实行真挚的合作。我们又决定：将本决议分送总统、国务院、参院外委会、众院外委会各一份。
