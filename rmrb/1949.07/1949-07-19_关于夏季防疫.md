    On Summer Epidemic Prevention
    Tan Ding
    Epidemic prevention is to prevent the occurrence and spread of acute infectious diseases. So why focus on epidemic prevention specifically in the summer? It's because during the summer, the temperature and humidity are ideal for the growth, reproduction, and transmission of pathogens of certain infectious diseases. All insects and microorganisms harmful to the human body, such as mosquitoes, flies, and bacteria, also reproduce particularly quickly at this time, constantly spreading germs everywhere, thus making various infectious diseases prone to occur. The diseases that should be given the most attention in summer epidemic prevention are typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery. Although the pathogens of these three diseases (typhoid bacillus, cholera vibrio, and dysentery bacillus or amoeba) are different, they exist in the same places and invade people through the same routes, so the prevention methods are also the same.
    The pathogens are present in the feces, urine, and vomit of patients. The spread of pathogens is mostly directly through the patient's excrement and secretions, or indirectly through contact with utensils used by the patient, or due to food contaminated by flies. Therefore, we should pay attention to:
    First, avoid opportunities for pathogens to invade:
    One, do not drink raw water or drinks and food made from raw water. Whether it is rainwater, well water, river water, or spring water, any that has not been disinfected (boiled or with disinfectant added) may contain bacteria (if the water contains cholera bacteria, you will get cholera if you drink it), so raw water and drinks and food made from raw water such as popsicles, ice cubes, sour plum soup, etc., should not be consumed. Similarly, fruits and vegetables sprinkled or soaked with raw water or that are rotten are at risk of being contaminated with bacteria. Eating these things is as harmful as drinking raw water. Therefore, fruits and vegetables should be disinfected with bleaching powder solution or potassium permanganate solution, or peeled, or washed with boiled water before eating.
    Two, do not eat food that flies have crawled on (eliminate flies), because flies go everywhere, especially like to approach manure piles and filth. They can pick up bacteria from feces on their feet and wings and then fly to food, thus invisibly spreading germs on food or utensils. How dangerous it would be to eat or drink these foods. Therefore, all utensils that flies have crawled on should be boiled, and food that flies have crawled on should be discarded or steamed and cooked before use. Cut fruits or fruits sprinkled with raw water are even more inedible. Therefore, eliminating flies is one of the main methods of summer hygiene.
    Second, maintain physical health and increase resistance:
    One, avoid overeating: Everyone has a certain habit and regularity in their gastrointestinal digestive function. If the quality or quantity of food exceeds the digestive capacity of the gastrointestinal tract, it is easy to develop gastrointestinal infectious diseases or gastroenteritis. Especially in summer, stomach acid is often reduced, so you should pay attention to appropriate diet.
    Two, avoid heatstroke: The temperature is too high in the hot season, and if the humidity is also high, body heat is not easily dissipated. If you are exposed to direct sunlight for a long time or in crowded public places, you are very prone to heatstroke. At this time, resistance often decreases, which is an inducement for the occurrence of disease.
    A way to increase resistance is through vaccination. From the progress of scientific medicine, we know that vaccines can be made artificially. After injecting this vaccine into the human body, the body produces a resistance to this vaccine. This resistance can not only resist the vaccine, but also resist infectious diseases identical to this vaccine. For example, after injecting cholera vaccine, the body develops the ability to resist cholera, and after injecting typhoid vaccine, the ability to resist typhoid fever develops. Therefore, you should get vaccinated to prevent summer infectious diseases.

    关于夏季防疫
    坦丁
    防疫就是要防止急性传染病的发生和流行。那么为什么单要在夏季防疫呢？是因为在夏季中，温度湿度很适合于某些传染病的病原菌生长繁殖及传播。一切危害人体的昆虫和微生物，如蚊蝇细菌等，此时也都繁殖的特别快，不断的把病菌传播到各处，因此使各种传染性疾病容易发生。在夏季防疫上最应注意的病便是伤寒、霍乱、痢疾。这三种疾病的病原菌（伤寒杆菌、霍乱弧菌及赤痢杆菌或阿米巴），虽然不同，但是它们存在地方和侵袭人的途径是一样的，因此预防的方法也便相同。
    病原是存在于病人的大小便及吐物中。病原的传播，多半是直接由病人的排泻物及分泌物，或者间接由接触病人用过的器具，或者是由于经过苍绳沾污的食物而传播，因此我们应该注意：
    第一、避免病根菌侵入机会：
    一、不可吃生水及由生水制成的饮食品，不论是雨水、井水、河水、泉水，凡未经过消毒处置的（煮开或加消毒药），就有含细菌的可能（如果水中含有霍乱菌，吃了就得霍乱），所以生水和生水做成的饮食品如冰棍、冰块、酸梅汤等等不可饮用。同样，用生水洒过或浸过的及腐败的瓜果菜蔬，那就有沾染细菌的危险，吃了这些东西，与吃了生水是同一害处。所以瓜果菜蔬，应当用漂白粉水或灰锰氧水消毒，或削皮，或用熟水洗净以后再吃。
    二、不吃苍蝇爬过的食物（扑灭苍蝇），因为苍蝇是什么地方都到的，尤其喜欢接近粪堆及污秽物，它可以把粪便中的细菌沾到满脚和翅膀而后又飞到食物上，这样便无形中把病菌都给撒布在食物或食具上，若是吃了或喝了这些食品该是多么危险。所以凡是苍蝇爬过的食具，都应该煮、爬过的食品则抛弃或蒸煮后再用。切开的瓜果或生水洒过瓜果更不可食，因此扑灭苍蝇更是夏令卫生的主要方法之一。
    第二、保持身体健康与增加抵抗能力：
    一、避免暴食：肠胃消化机能个人都有一定习惯和规律，若是在食品质上或量上超过了肠胃的消化力时，则容易发生肠胃的传染病，或是胃肠炎，尤其夏天时胃酸常是减少，更应注意饮食的适当。
    二、避免中暑：暑季温度太高，若是再加湿度高时则体温即不易放散，若长时间处于太阳的直晒之下，或人多的公共场所，都极容易中暑，这时抵抗力常减低，为疾病发生之诱因。
    增加抵抗力的方法是预防注射。从科学医学的进展中，我们知道以人工的方法可以制出疫苗，把此种疫苗注射到人体后，体内即产生一种抵抗此疫苗的抵抗力来；这种抵抗力非但可以抵抗疫苗，并且可以抵抗与这种疫苗相同的传染病。如注射霍乱疫苗后，身体内即发生抵抗霍乱的能力，注射伤寒疫苗后，即发生抵抗伤寒的能力，所以在预防夏令传染病时应注射预防针。
