Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 7th: Since liberation, railway workers on the Jinghu, Huhang, and Zhegan Railways have immediately guaranteed the rapid restoration of transportation on all lines with a new attitude of being masters of their own labor and enthusiastic work. Before the liberation of Shanghai, Jinghu Railway workers, in order to support the People's Liberation Army's rapid liberation of Shanghai, worked day and night to repair bridges and rails destroyed by the bandit troops, and marched towards Shanghai together with the People's Liberation Army. On May 13th, Kunshan was liberated. The employees of the Suzhou Engineering Section rushed to Kunshan that night and repaired three destroyed bridges in the rain, completing the task scheduled for six days in three and a half days. The Jinghu Railway was fully opened to traffic on the night of Shanghai's liberation. In the first month after the liberation of the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory (May), it reached the pre-liberation production level, repairing a total of twelve locomotives, thirty-five passenger cars, and more than 73,000 catties of forged steel. In addition, the output of oxygen, coke, and other products exceeded the factory's average monthly output from January to May. In order to welcome "July 1st" and the direct through train service between Peiping and Shanghai, the factory specially renovated a brand-new "July 1st Commemorative" locomotive and presented it to Chairman Mao a month ago. The production efficiency of the Shanghai Machinery Factory has also been greatly improved. Lathe worker Hao Wenlin completed in seven days the work that exceeded half a month's work before liberation. Veteran fitter Yuan Jinrong sharpened 500 chucks in seven days. In addition, the movement to improve machinery and save coal and oil initiated by the staff and workers of the Suzhou Station locomotive depot has gradually spread throughout the line.

The staff and workers of the Hangzhou passenger and freight car depot of the Huhang Railway repaired a total of 143 flat cars from the 21st to the 23rd of last month, including the overhaul of seven gorgeously decorated "Shanghai" passenger cars, an average of forty-eight cars per day. Before liberation, the factory could only repair an average of thirty-four cars per day. In the past, many cars had to be sent to the Qishuyan factory for repairs. Now, the factory workers have demonstrated a high degree of creativity, overcoming the difficulties of tools and repairing these cars as well.

The staff and workers of the Xiaoshan Machinery Factory of the Zhegan Railway repeatedly delayed the repair of a broken locomotive in order to protect the locomotive from being taken away by the bandit troops before liberation. After liberation, they immediately repaired the locomotive and named it "Guangzhou" to support the People's Liberation Army in fighting to Guangzhou. A crane that was incomplete and had been unattended for two years was also repaired by them under difficult material conditions after liberation. The factory is now collecting parts of automobiles and rock drills abandoned on the road after being destroyed by the bandit troops, and plans to renovate a new rock drill. The staff and workers of the Jinhua Repair Factory of the railway were forced to repair a military train from Nanchang when the bandit troops fled. Not only did they not repair it, but they took advantage of the night to dismantle and bury the parts. After liberation, they immediately repaired it to support the People's Liberation Army's advance into Jiangxi. They also completed the repair of the "July 1st Train" on June 29th. When the newly decorated train head and carriages drove out of the factory, all the staff and workers were extremely excited and expressed their determination to work harder in the future to accelerate the liberation of the whole country.

　　江南铁路职工积极工作
  　交通迅速恢复
  　京沪路全路展开节约运动
    【新华社上海七日电】京沪、沪杭、浙赣各铁路的铁路职工，解放后立即以主人翁的新的劳动态度和热情工作保证了各路交通的迅速恢复。京沪铁路的职工在上海解放以前，为了支援解放军迅速解放上海，曾夜以继日地抢修被匪军破坏了的桥梁和路轨，和解放军一齐向上海前进。五月十三日崑山解放，苏州工务段的员工当夜就赶到了崑山，冒雨抢修被破坏了的三道桥梁，三天半完成了预定六天的任务。上海解放的当夜京沪路即全线通车。该路戚墅堰机厂解放后第一个月（五月份），即达到解放前的生产水平，共修理机车十二辆，客车三十五辆，锻铸钢七万三千余斤。此外氧气、焦炭等的产量均超过了该厂一月至五月的平均产量。该厂为迎接“七一”和迎接平沪直达通车，月前特装修了一辆崭新的“七一纪念号”机车献给毛主席。上海机器厂的生产效率也大大提高了。车床工人郝文林七天完成的工作超过解放前半个月的工作。钳床装配老工人袁金荣七天磨好了五百只夹把。此外，苏州车站机车房职工掀起的改进机务和节省用煤用油的运动已在全路逐渐展开。
    沪杭铁路杭州客货车房的职工，在上月二十一到二十三日共修平板车一百四十三辆，包括大修装置华丽的“上海”号客车七辆，每天平均修了四十八辆。在解放以前该厂每天平均只能修三十四辆。许多车在过去是必须送到戚墅堰工厂才能修的，现在该厂工人发挥了高度的创造智慧，克服了工具的困难，把这些车也修好了。
    浙赣路的萧山机厂职工，在解放前他们为保护机车不被匪军拉走，一再拖延一辆坏机车的修理工作，解放后他们立即把这辆机车修好了，并命名为“广州”号，要支援解放军打到广州去。一台残缺不全、两年来无人过问的吊车，解放后也经他们在器材困难的条件下修好。现该厂正搜集被匪军破坏后遗弃在路上的汽车和开山机的零件，计划装修一辆新的开山机。该路金华修理厂的职工，在匪军逃窜时曾被迫修理一列南昌开来的军车，他们不仅不修理，却乘夜把零件拆卸埋藏了。解放后他们又立即修好，支援解放军向江西的进军。他们又在六月二十九日完成了“七一列车”的修理。当装饰一新的车头车箱从车厂开出时，全厂职工无限兴奋，纷纷表示今后要更加紧工作，以加速全国解放。
