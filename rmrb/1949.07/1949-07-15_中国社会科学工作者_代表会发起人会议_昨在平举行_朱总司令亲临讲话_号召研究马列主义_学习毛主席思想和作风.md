The meeting elected Wang Kunlun, Shi Liang, Ai Siqi, Du Shousu, Li Da, Shen Junru, Shen Zhiyuan, Lin Boqu, Zhou Enlai, Fan Wenlan, Hou Wailu, Ma Yinchu, Tao Menghe, Chen Boda, Chen Shaoyu, Chen Yuan, Guo Moruo, Zhang Xiruo, Zhang Dongsun, Tang Yongtong, Dong Biwu, Jian Bozan, Deng Chumin, Yan Baohang, Xie Juezai and 25 others to form the presidium. Following this, Guo Moruo delivered the opening speech, and Lin Boqu reported on the preparatory process. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Zhou Enlai also delivered speeches. The meeting is scheduled to continue today (the 15th) to discuss the draft charter of the preparatory committee for the Chinese Social Scientists Representative Conference and other topics.

[Beiping Dispatch] The full text of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's speech at the inaugural meeting of the Social Scientists Representative Conference is as follows:

    Our ability to hold this social science conference now is the result of the victory of correct social science. This social science is Marxism-Leninism. There is only one correct social science in the world, and that is Marxism-Leninism. The bourgeoisie is an exploiting class and therefore cannot arrive at scientific conclusions on social issues. Only the proletariat can truly form this science. The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have applied this science, developed this science, and explained the laws of Chinese society and revolution to guide the advancement of the Chinese revolution.

    With this science combined with the masses, the Chinese revolution has been victorious. The victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of Marxist-Leninist social science. Those who support the victory of the Chinese revolution must acknowledge this truth, pay attention to this truth, and study this truth. The practice of the Chinese revolution has shown that all bourgeois social doctrines have gone bankrupt. The reason why Marxism-Leninism is the truth is because it can withstand the test and can guide practice to achieve victory. This is what Chairman Mao often tells us. Bourgeois social doctrines cannot withstand the test of social practice, both abroad and in China.

    Chairman Mao's application of Marxism-Leninism to China has achieved brilliant results. However, there are still many, many wastelands in Chinese society and history that need to be reclaimed by social science, and scientific conclusions need to be drawn from research. For example, Chairman Mao gave us the task long ago of writing a history of modern Chinese philosophy, economic history, political history, military history, and literary history. But as a result, not a single one has come out so far.

    If Chinese social scientists in the past did not have the political and economic conditions to write with peace of mind, now these possibilities exist. Anyone who puts in the effort can achieve results. It is hoped that after this meeting, everyone can learn from and encourage each other to achieve these results.

    In addition to conducting specialized research, we should also popularize the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. This is a major task. We should also translate the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, as well as many valuable Soviet social science books. So our task is significant. Don't be afraid of having nothing to do, only be afraid of not being ambitious and not making an effort.

    Chairman Mao applied Marxism-Leninism to develop Chinese social science and guide the victory of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, in the field of social science, in many departments, if we can learn from Chairman Mao's style and work diligently, we will surely achieve many, many victories.

    Celebrate the success of the conference!
    Celebrate the victory of social science in China!

　　中国社会科学工作者
    代表会发起人会议
    昨在平举行
    朱总司令亲临讲话
  　号召研究马列主义
  　学习毛主席思想和作风
    【平市讯】中国社会科学工作者代表会发起人会议十四日下午三时在中南海勤政殿开幕，出席者一百四十余人。会议于选出王昆仑、史良、艾思奇、杜守素、李达、沈钧儒、沈志远、林伯渠、周恩来、范文澜、侯外卢、马寅初、陶孟和、陈伯达、陈绍禹、陈垣、郭沫若、张奚若、张东荪、汤用彤、董必武、翦伯赞、邓初民、阎宝航、谢觉哉等二十五人为主席团后，由郭沫若致开幕词，林伯渠报告发起经过。并有朱总司令和周恩来等讲话。会议定今（十五）日继续举行，以讨论中国社会科学工作者代表会筹备会简章等议题。
    【平市讯】朱总司令在社会科学工作者代表会发起人会议中的演说词，全文如下：
    我们现在能开这个社会科学会议，是正确的社会科学胜利的结果。这种社会科学，就是马克思——列宁主义。世界上只有一种正确的社会科学，这就是马克思——列宁主义。资产阶级是剥削阶级，因此在社会问题上不能得出科学的结论。只有无产阶级才能真正形成这种科学。中国共产党和毛主席，就是运用了这种科学，发展了这种科学，说明了中国社会和革命的规律来指导中国革命的前进。
    有了这种科学和群众相结合，中国革命就胜利了。中国革命的胜利，就是马克思——列宁主义社会科学的胜利。拥护中国革命胜利的人，必须承认这个真理，注意这个真理，研究这个真理。中国革命的实践说明了所有资产阶级的社会学说都是破产了的。马克思——列宁主义之所以是真理，是因为它经得起考验，并且能指导实际而得到胜利。这点是毛主席经常告诉我们的。资产阶级社会学说经不起社会实践的考验，在外国是这样，在中国也是这样。
    毛主席应用马克思——列宁主义到中国来，已得到光辉的成就。但是，中国社会与历史还有许多许多荒地需要社会科学来开垦，需要从研究当中得出科学的结论。比方毛主席很早以前就向我们提出任务：要写一部近代中国哲学史，经济史，政治史，军事史，文艺史。但结果到现在还没有出来一部。
    如果过去中国社会科学家没有政治的经济的条件来安心写作，现在就有了这种可能了。任何人如果用工夫就能有成绩。希望此次会议后，大家能互相切磋鼓励，就能达到这种成绩。
    除了作专门研究外，还应把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说通俗化，这是个重大的工作。还应把马恩列斯的著作和苏联许多有价值的社会科学书翻译过来。所以我们的任务是重大的。不怕没事作，只怕不发奋，不努力。
    毛主席应用马克思——列宁主义发展了中国社会科学，指导了中国革命的胜利。那么，在社会科学领域上，在许多部门上，我们如能学到毛主席的作风，来埋头工作，就一定能得到很多很多的胜利。
    庆祝会议成功！
    庆祝社会科学在中国的胜利！
