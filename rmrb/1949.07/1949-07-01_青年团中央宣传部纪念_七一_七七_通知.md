    (1) Youth League committees at all levels should pay attention to mobilizing youth to actively participate in memorial gatherings held by the people in various localities on "July 7th." From "July 1st" to "July 7th," they should strengthen the organization of propaganda activities such as speeches, forums, exhibitions, street wall newspapers, street skits, costume lectures, living newspapers, singing, and Yangko dances. If possible, Youth League committees at all levels should mobilize young people to visit and comfort the families of martyrs and soldiers, and Youth League members should perform one day of voluntary labor for the families of martyrs and soldiers. If possible, all these activities should be jointly organized with general youth organizations.

    (2) Youth League committees at all levels should hold cadre meetings and member conferences to ensure that each member understands the significance of commemorating "July 1st" and "July 7th." The commemoration of "July 1st" should focus on internal propaganda and education within the League. Youth League committees at all levels can hold commemorations independently or participate in gatherings held by the Chinese Communist Party committees in various localities on "July 1st." When holding commemorations independently, they should invite representatives from the local CCP committees to provide guidance and invite non-League youth or their representatives to participate.

    (3) After the commemoration of "July 1st" and "July 7th," Youth League committees at all levels should send a summary report of their work to us.
