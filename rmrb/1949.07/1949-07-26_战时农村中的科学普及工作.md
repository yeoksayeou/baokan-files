　　Scientific Popularization in Rural Areas During Wartime
    Tian Huonong

    In the old liberated areas of North China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government for eleven years, the work of popularizing scientific knowledge has achieved considerable success and experience.

    Before the War of Resistance, most farmers (especially in mountainous areas) believed that the warlord infighting and imperialist aggression and oppression were "unavoidable calamities," and that their poverty and oppression were due to "fate"; crop disasters were said to be "natural disasters," and they prayed to the "Dragon King" for rain during droughts. When insect plagues occurred, they were called "divine insects," and the more they were hit, the more they dared not exterminate them. However, after years of rent reduction campaigns and land reform, the vast number of working people were liberated from long-term oppression, and through the Communist Party's class education, they personally experienced that "labor creates everything." Production enthusiasm soared, and life rose day by day. They proudly and happily sang: "We were born with two hands, and we can have everything through labor!" The ideology of fatalism has since been shaken.

    In order to improve agricultural technology, the Anti-Japanese Democratic Government established agricultural experiment and improvement institutions even during the brutal war. After Japan's surrender, agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry experiment and promotion institutions were established more extensively. Currently, North China has twenty-nine agricultural experiment farms and breeding farms, one hundred and sixty-two extension stations, five forestry and animal husbandry bureaus, three forestry and animal husbandry promotion agencies, and one veterinary disease prevention brigade. Each administrative office has extension teams, work stations, veterinary stations, and breeding stock stations, forming a network throughout towns and villages. Many villages have organized technical research committees (such as those led by Wang Luohe, Shi Cunjin, Niu Renshun, and Lian Kunming, which included hero models, technical experts, and farmers with research interests) or conducted technical research and experience exchange through mutual aid groups. These institutions have enabled many young people and women who are new to agricultural production to learn techniques and experience, allowed many new technologies to be promoted, and enabled some unreasonable experiences to be criticized and improved. Through local newspapers, these institutions have become places where farmers can ask questions and raise doubts. Some farmers, primary school teachers, and cadres have also actively sought out farms to exchange experiences, exchange superior varieties, and request agriculture or borrow sprayers.

    Due to the gradual popularization and improvement of agricultural scientific knowledge, farmers have realized that pests are not divine insects and can be eliminated. For example, in 1944, there was a plague of locusts that covered the sky. In the Taihang, Jizhong, and Beiyue (now Chahar Province) regions alone, sixty-nine counties were affected, and locust eradication became a serious task at the time. Led by cadres, millions of men, women, and children were organized to persistently and tirelessly fight locust nymphs while resisting the Japanese invaders' plunder and destruction. According to incomplete statistics from thirty counties, a total of 19.24 million catties of locusts were exterminated. If they were connected one by one, they could circle the earth more than once. Some people said, "The base areas are really amazing. Locusts can't get in without a road pass!" This greatly reduced the affected area and rescued crops, eradicating backward and superstitious ideas. After the farm studied the life history of the jujube weevil, it promoted to the masses that the jujube weevil, like the silkworm, is a cyclic metamorphosis from moth to egg, hatching into a jujube weevil, then becoming a pupa, and transforming into a moth. Many hero model workers (such as Fu Zhenheng, Bai Zhixian, and Meng Hangsu) also actually raised and observed the process, inviting the masses to visit each metamorphosis. From then on, the masses completely believed that the jujube weevil did not grow out of the jujube buds, and they unanimously said, "The government is really amazing. Whatever they say, it is!" They progressed from simply using poles to hit the weevils to digging up pupae, piling up sand to catch moths, hitting small weevils, and hitting old weevils, and even using sprayers to control them. In addition, the removal of diseased plants and seed disinfection were promoted to prevent and control black jaundice and white hair disease, and the planting of the disease-resistant wheat variety No. 72 was promoted, reducing losses from jaundice and head blight.

    In terms of drought prevention, during the droughts of 1942, 1945, 1947, and this year, farmers in various regions, under the leadership of the government, held symposiums to exchange drought resistance experiences, carried out soil well digging, water transportation for planting and seedling watering, more harrowing, more hoeing, and the selection of drought-resistant varieties (such as 811 millet, sweet potatoes, and late-planted early-maturing small yellow millet, sixty-day homecoming millet, and mung beans). In particular, the development of water conservancy and afforestation fundamentally overcame the threat of drought, which also promoted scientific knowledge in water conservancy and forestry. The completion of some arduous water conservancy projects and the success of sand desert afforestation made the masses amazed and grateful, saying, "We should build a temple for you!"

    The government also used the common sayings "a fat son comes from a fat mother" and "bitter gourd seeds cannot grow sweet melons" to call for field selection and variety replacement, and put forward the criteria for identifying superior varieties. Many farmers (such as Liu Jubao and Gou Hankui) used relatively scientific methods to cultivate superior varieties. Farms in various regions also cultivated and purchased large quantities of superior varieties according to the needs of farmers, such as S cotton, 811 millet, Huanong No. 4 millet, Bianyi millet, No. 72 wheat, Guangzong wheat, spring and autumn wheat, Victory rice, and Victory sweet potatoes, which were very popular among the masses. This year alone, the various improved varieties promoted can be planted on about 600,000 mu.

    Because the productivity of farmers has been liberated, they are eager to improve their technology on the basis of their existing experience, and they warmly welcome "soil doctors." Therefore, agricultural technology has become an indispensable part of strengthening agricultural production leadership.

    The above is only the author's partial understanding. These achievements also demonstrate the change in farmers' thinking. Of course, we know that these achievements are extremely unbalanced, and we must make even greater efforts on this basis to popularize scientific knowledge.

    It is hoped that our natural scientists, under the leadership of the Communist Party in the future, will establish a working attitude of wholeheartedly serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is also a pointer for natural scientists. We have opposed dogmatism, opposed capitulationism in technology, transplanting foreign methods, opposed being obsessed with personal interests, attempting to obtain doctoral degrees from abroad and separating from the masses, and also opposed empiricism that resists the application of modern natural science achievements. In the countryside, we must emphasize starting from the farmers' existing economic foundation, production methods, and experience, adopt popular, simple, easy-to-implement, and effective methods according to the urgent needs of the vast majority of the people. Such as promotion stations, promotion teams, epidemic prevention teams, exhibitions, short-term training classes, symposiums, newspapers, etc., it is necessary to emphasize coming from the masses and going to the masses, and the principle of "popularizing under the guidance of improvement and improving on the basis of popularization" combines science with mass experience and promotes from point to surface.

    The scientific movement in the rural areas of North China is also a struggle between science and non-science. In these short ten years, it has defeated or shaken the feudal superstitions and backward toxins of thousands of years, improved scientific knowledge and production technology, and this movement is accelerating. But we must remember what Chairman Mao said: "The serious problem is to educate the peasants." We must make a hundred times more effort to make the major cities a lever for the scientific movement in the countryside!

　　战时农村中的科学普及工作
    田活农
    华北老解放区的农村，十一年来经共产党、民主政府的领导，科学知识的普及工作，获得了不少的成绩与经验。
    抗战前大部农民（尤其在山岳地区）认为军阀混战、帝国主义侵略压迫，是“劫数难逃”，生活贫困受压迫，则归咎于“命中注定”；庄稼受灾，说是“天年”，天旱了向“龙王爷”求雨，发生了虫灾，说是“神虫”，越打越多，不敢扑灭。但经过历年减租运动与土地改革，广大劳苦人民从长期压迫中翻过身来，又经过共产党的阶级教育，他们亲身体验到“劳动创造一切”。生产情绪空前高涨，生活日益上升，他们骄傲而愉快地歌唱：“我们生下两只手，劳动起来样样有！”宿命论的思想从此动摇了。
    为了改进农业技术，抗日民主政府虽在残酷的战争中，亦设置了农业试验改进机构，日本投降以后，农林畜牧的试验推广机构更广泛的设立，现在华北设有二十九个大小农业试验场兼繁殖场、一百六十二个推广场、五个林牧局、三个林牧推进社、一个兽疫防治大队，各行署均设有推广队、工作站、兽医站、种畜站等，网布于各城镇乡村，不少村庄组织起技术研究委员会（如王洛合、石寸金、牛仁顺、连昆明等领导的村庄均吸收英雄模范、技术能手，及有研究兴趣的农民参加），或通过互助组，进行技术研究及经验交换。这些机构，使许多初参加农业生产的青年、妇女学得技术与经验，使许多新技术推广出去，使某些不合理的经验得到批判改进。这些机构通过各地小报纸，多已成为农民问难质疑的场所，有的农民或小学教员、干部并主动找农场交换经验，交换优良品种，要农业、借喷务器等。
    由于农业科学知识的逐渐普及和提高，使农民认识了害虫不是神虫，可以消灭的。如一九四四年曾发生了遮天蔽日的飞蝗、仅太行、冀中、北岳（现在的察哈尔省）三地区即有六十九个县受害，灭蝗成了当时的严重任务。经干部带头，组织起千百万男女老幼，坚持饥饿、不疲倦地反复地，一面抗击日寇侵掠破坏，一面扑灭蝗蝻，据三十个县不完全统计，共灭蝗一九二四万斤，如果把它一个一个接起来可围绕地球一周多，有的人说：“根据地真厉害，蝗虫没有路条就是进不去！”大大缩小了被灾面积，抢救了庄稼。铲除了落后迷信思想。农场研究枣步曲的生活史之后，向群众宣传枣步曲也和蚕一样，是由蛾生卵，孵为枣步曲，再变为蛹，化为蛾的循环变态。不少英雄模范工作者（如傅振恒、白志贤、孟行素等）还实际饲养观察，每一变态即邀集群众参观，从此群众完全相信枣步曲不是从枣芽里长出来的，而且异口同声的说：“政府真了不起，说有什么就有什么。”并且由单纯的用杆子打步曲进而挖蛹，堆砂堆捉蛾，打小步曲，打老步曲，以至用喷雾器除治。此外还推广了拔除病株、种籽消毒等防除黑疸及白发病，推广种植抗病力强的七十二号小麦，减少了黄疸，蜜穗的损失。
    在防旱方面，一九四二年、四五年、四七年以及今年旱灾的袭击，各地农民在政府领导下，举行座谈会，交换抗旱经验，进行打土井、运水点种浇苗、多耙、多锄，以及选种抗旱性强的品种（如八一一谷、甘薯及晚种早熟的小黄谷、六十日还家谷、绿豆等）。特别是发展水利与造林，从根本上克服旱灾的威胁，从中也推广了水利上林业上的科学知识。由于某些艰巨的水利工程的完成及砂荒造林的成功，使群众惊奇而感激地说：“真该给你们盖庙！”
    政府并利用“母大儿肥”“苦瓜籽长不出甜瓜来”的俗谚，号召田间选种及换种，提出鉴别优良品种的标准。不少农民（如刘聚宝、勾汉奎等）以比较科学的办法，培植优良品种。各地农场也根据农民需要培植及收购大量的优良品种，如斯字棉、八一一谷、华农四号谷、边一谷、七十二号小麦、广宗小麦、春秋兼种小麦、胜利稻子、胜利甘薯等，备受群众欢迎。单今年推广的各种良种，约可种植六十万亩。
    由于农民的生产力解放了，他们迫切要求在现有经验基础上提高技术，他们对“地大夫”极表欢迎。因之农业技术已是加强农业生产领导所不可缺少的部分。
    以上所述，仅是笔者的局部了解。就这些成绩，也表现了农民思想观念的改变。当然我们知道这些成绩是极不平衡的，须在此基础上更加倍努力，普及科学知识。
    希望我们自然科学工作者，今后在共产党的领导下，确立全心全意为工农兵服务的工作态度。毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，同样是自然科学工作者的指针。我们曾反对教条主义，反对技术上的投降主义，搬用外国的一套，反对沉迷于个人兴趣，企图向外国取得博士学位的脱离群众的作法，也反对抵抗应用现代自然科学成就的经验主义。我们在农村中必须强调从农民现有的经济基础、生产方式及经验出发，根据最大多数人民的迫切需要，采用通俗、简单易行而又收效较大的办法。如推广场、推广队、防疫队、展览会、短期训练班、座谈会、报纸等，要强调从群众中来，到群众中去，“在提高的指导下普及，在普及的基础上提高”的方针使科学与群众经验相结合，由点到面的推广。
    华北农村中的科学化运动，也是科学与非科学的斗争，在这短短的十余年间，打败了或摇撼了数千年封建迷信落后的遗毒，提高了科学知识生产技术，而且这个运动正在加速发展着，但我们要记住毛主席说：“严重的问题是教育农民”。我们更要百倍的努力，使各大城市成为农村科学化运动的杠杆！
