Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 19th: TASS, New York, 18th: Official and unofficial statistics prove that the living standards of the American working class have declined further as monopoly capitalists have been trying their best to shift the growing burden of the crisis onto the shoulders of the people. These figures reveal the increase in unemployment and the decrease in weekly wages, while on the other hand, the cost of living remains high, and even slightly increased. According to the statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor, 320,000 workers have been laid off in manufacturing since mid-April. Since September 1948, 1.7 million workers in manufacturing have been unemployed. In New York State, more than 535,000 workers included in the unemployment relief system have applied for unemployment relief. This is the highest record since New York State implemented the unemployment subsidy system in 1937. However, even this figure does not reflect the actual situation, because many types of workers are not included in the unemployment relief system. In New York, workers can only receive unemployment benefits for a maximum of twenty-six weeks, after which their families can only rely on the meager maintenance fees of the municipal authorities. Hundreds of thousands of workers' families have to rely on the small relief from local charities to avoid starvation. The first half of this year saw the most drastic wage reduction since the end of the war. Robert Damm, Director of the Labor Science Research Association, compared the average weekly wage with the cost of living and concluded that from January 1945 to January 1949, the average real wage of manufacturing workers fell by nearly 15 percent. However, the exploitation of workers is becoming more and more serious. For example, according to Robert Damm's estimates, the profit obtained from each worker in manufacturing increased from 470 yuan in 1939 to 1,480 yuan in 1948, that is, more than tripled.

    垄断资本家转嫁危机重担
    美工人生活益恶化
    纽约州失业工人超过五十三万
    【新华社北平十九日电】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：官方和非官方的统计数字证明：由于垄断资本家竭力将日益增涨的危机的重担转嫁到人民群众的肩上，美国工人阶级的生活水准已更为低落。这些数字透露出失业的增加和每周工资的下降，而另一方面，生活费用仍然很高，甚至还略有上涨。根据美国劳工部的统计，自四月中旬以来，制造业已解雇工人三十二万。自一九四八年九月以来，制造业方面已有一百七十万工人失业。在纽约州，包括在失业救济制度之内的工人，申请失业救济的超过五十三万五千人。这是一九三七年纽约州实行失业补助制度以来的最高纪录。但是，甚至就是这个数字，也并没有反映出实际的情况，因为有许多种工人并未被包括在失业救济制度之内。在纽约，工人领取失业救济金的时间，不能超过二十六周，在这之后，他们的家庭便只能仰赖于市当局少得可怜的维持费。数以十万计的工人家庭，不能不靠当地慈善机关微小的救济来避免饿死。今年上半年发生了战争结束以来最急剧的工资减少。劳工科学研究协会主任罗伯特·达姆将每周的平均工资和生活费用作一比较，得出结论说：从一九四五年一月到一九四九年一月，制造业工人平均实际工资降落近百分之十五。但是，工人所受的剥削，却愈来愈重。譬如，根据罗伯特·达姆的估计，制造业从每个工人身上取得的利润，从一九三九年的四百七十元增加到一九四八年的一千四百八十元，也就是说，增加了三倍以上。
