Experiences and Problems in the Tenant Farming Work in Chahar Province
　　Zhao Hong
　　(I)
　　Judging from the materials from Jianping, Yanbei, Yishui, and Pingxi four sub-districts of Chahar Province, this year's tenant farming work has achieved great results, and there are new developments in the form of tenant farming. In Yishui sub-district, many areas have solved or are solving the tenant farming problem. Jianping sub-district has also vigorously improved tenant farming work. Therefore, in most areas of the old revolutionary base of Chahar, the tenant farming work that could not be done well for several years has now been gradually and reasonably resolved.
　　The Jianping sub-district mainly promoted the contract system of tenant farming with guaranteed yield and contracts. As of early May, among the 1,225 villages in Jianping, Pingshan, Jingxing, and Quyang counties, 736 villages had implemented the contract tenant farming system, 269 villages had determined tenant farming objects and acreage and were in the process of assessing yields and signing contracts, and 171 villages had not yet fixed tenant farming. In the fifth district of Lingshou, among the 50 villages, 38 villages have established good contract tenant farming methods, and a wooden sign is inserted next to the land being tenant farmed, stating the acreage, yield, tenant farmer, and the names of martyrs' and soldiers' families, for inspection at any time. The three counties of Xingtang, Fuping, and Lingshou have also largely established the contract tenant farming system.
　　The method and process of implementing the contract tenant farming system in the fifth district of Jianping is: (1) First, through various organizations, publicize and explain the benefits of the contract tenant farming system, and investigate and register the number of martyrs', soldiers', and workers' families, land, and labor force. (2) Promote the masses to find objects and freely organize tenant farming. (3) Finally, assess yields and sign contracts.
　　In promoting the organization of tenant farming, the Jianping sub-district combined it with checking the past selfishness of concealing work and falsely reporting manpower and animal power, and liquidated and summarized the old work, rectified and improved the service system, and implemented strict work recording, work evaluation, and full attendance systems. Due to the in-depth publicity and explanation work in organizing tenant farming, the relationship between the masses and the martyrs' and soldiers' families has become closer. Therefore, this year's tenant farming work has been highly satisfactory to the martyrs' and soldiers' families and the broad masses, and significant results have been seen in production.
　　The tenant farming forms in Yishui sub-district are divided into four types: (1) Contract work system. That is, assessing the acreage and number of workdays to be tenant farmed for the martyrs' and soldiers' families, and letting them find relatives, friends, or other suitable people to implement fixed contract work on the principle of mutual voluntariness; tenant farmers are exempted from other services according to their rights. (2) Contract planting system. Roughly the same as the Jianping sub-district method. (3) Work point system. After determining the number of workdays that should be tenant farmed for the martyrs' and soldiers' families, work points are issued, and when work is needed, wages in rice are drawn from the village office with the work points (generally five to six catties per workday), and the rice used is apportioned according to the entire village's labor force; if the martyrs' and soldiers' families actively produce and save work points, they can also receive rice. This method is basically a method of substituting labor with grain, which is very popular. (4) Assigning work system. Assigning work on a piecemeal basis. This method is the worst and is mostly prevalent in new areas or areas with a poor work foundation.
　　In the Pingxi sub-district, many areas have promoted the work point system. The specific methods vary. Wanping divides martyrs', soldiers', and workers' families into three grades according to their living conditions and labor force and issues work points according to the grade; Laishui generally implements quarterly work evaluation throughout the county and issues work points quarterly, which is more meticulous; Xiatan Village in Fangshan more specifically stipulates the acreage to be tenant farmed according to the whole and half male and female labor force of each martyr's and soldier's family and issues work points, allowing them to find their own objects, generally finding relatives and neighbors on a voluntary basis, and using a lively recording of work, which greatly stimulates the enthusiasm of tenant farmers. Martyrs' and soldiers' families save work points due to labor and find prices in full attendance.
　　The tenant farming forms in Yanbei sub-district are also roughly divided into three types: contract work, contract planting, and assigning work. Among them, contract work is the most popular, and contract planting has not been widely promoted. Dajian Village in Lingqiu uses cooperatives to solve tenant farming.
　　(II)
　　The achievements of tenant farming work in Chahar Province are very great, but there are still many problems in many areas. For example, recently the Jianping District Committee and the Lingqiu County Committee in Yanbei conducted inspections of the tenant farming work and found that although this year's tenant farming work has made great progress compared with previous years, due to the administrative command style and bureaucracy of the leadership, the tenant farming work has not been universally done well, and there are several problems that need to be resolved immediately.
　　(1) Due to insufficient publicity and education from the leadership, village cadres and the masses have not truly recognized the significance of tenant farming work, so the tenant farming work has not been seriously and universally implemented, and village cadres still have a troublesome attitude, and the masses have a perfunctory attitude. According to inspections, among the 43 villages in the fourth district of Jingxing, only four villages have implemented contract tenant farming, 18 villages are allocating piecemeal work, and 21 villages have basically not implemented tenant farming work. In many areas of the Jianping sub-district, tenant farming team members still strongly demand that martyrs' and soldiers' families provide meals; if they do not provide meals, they will not tenant farm; a tenant farming team leader in Donghuishe, Pingshan said: "You fool my stomach, I fool your land." Two martyrs' and soldiers' families in Beizeying have only used two workdays so far because they cannot afford to provide meals. Some village cadres find it troublesome or do not seriously implement tenant farming, emphasizing that the masses have heavy tenant farming tasks, so there is a tendency of too small a tenant farming area in many areas, and even deceiving superiors, reporting that the tenant farming work has been done well, but in reality, it has not been done at all. New district cadres emphasize that the problem of soldiers' family tenant farming is not big, and they are relaxed about tenant farming; or they think that arranging it is enough to complete the task, and they do not supervise or inspect, so although many contracts have been signed, they are just a formality. For example, a team member in Weizhou Fifth Street, Jingxing, who tenant farmed two acres of wheat land, did not water it once, and the wheat was dried up, but he watered his own wheat twice.
　　(2) In promoting tenant farming work, there is still a bad style of administrative command, which is also one of the important reasons why tenant farming cannot be universally and effectively implemented. For example, in some areas of the Jianping sub-district, an administrative command and cadre package method was adopted when signing contracts. After the district issued contracts to Sizhuang and Mengling villages in Pingshan (this method is very inappropriate), village cadres did not conduct democratic discussions, free consultations, and mutual agreement with the tenant farming households and the tenant farmed households, but found a literate person to fabricate and fill it out and reported it to the district, as if they were handling errands. Therefore, some tenant farming households despise the credibility of the contract and still do not seriously implement it after signing the contract.
　　(3) Research on the form of tenant farming. The form of tenant farming can be diverse according to the specific conditions of each place and each household, and the leadership does not need to and should not make uniform regulations. Otherwise, it will form the practice of administrative command. The two principles (solving practical problems according to conditions, voluntariness, and mutual benefit) and three methods (large-scale tenant farming, small-scale tenant farming, and fixed work) proposed by the Jianping District Committee are good, but the three methods must be determined according to the specific situation and cannot be rigidly promoted. The Hunyuan County Committee seems to be still emphasizing the method of guaranteed yield. Therefore, the tenant farming forms in various places must be carefully studied and correctly criticized.
　　A. The contract tenant farming system with guaranteed yield has been vigorously promoted in the Jianping sub-district. According to the special commissioner's report: this form accounts for a quarter of the total tenant farming in the district, and Hunyuan and other areas also have this method. But this form: First, it should generally only be applied to widowed and orphaned martyrs' and soldiers' families without labor, and should not be universally adopted. Second, there are many difficulties in promoting this method, such as the general public being afraid of losing money, and the phenomenon of "only willing to contract work, not willing to contract grain" is very common. In addition, there are also concerns on the part of the martyrs' and soldiers' families, fearing that there will be no guarantee after the autumn, fearing that they will not be able to eat melons, vegetables, and beans, etc. Many differences and disputes will inevitably be encountered when starting to promote this method: first, there are disputes over the yield, and second, there are disputes over water fees, fertilizer and other advance payments. Therefore, the places where this method has been successfully implemented must have been achieved in in-depth publicity and explanation, and the specific resolution of various problems in democratic discussions, free consultations, and mutual voluntariness, such as Eyaquan Village in Hunyuan.
　　B. Fixed contract work system. This method is generally reported to be better, which can not only enhance the tenant farmer's sense of responsibility, but also promote the production enthusiasm of the martyrs' and soldiers' families, and it is relatively simple and easy to implement. Half of the Jianping sub-district adopts this form. However, doing this method well also depends on the correct leadership and mobilization of the masses. For example, the following tendencies that have been discovered should be paid close attention to: First, some village cadres want private favors, and instead of going through democratic evaluation, the cadres handle it single-handedly, resulting in unfair and unreasonable phenomena. Second, village cadres make selfishness, falsely reporting the number of households, acreage, and workdays to superiors, attempting to reduce the burden on the village. Under this circumstance, the tenant farming for martyrs' and soldiers' families has a tendency to be too high or too low. For example, the seventh district of Hunyuan generally decided that the tenant farming work was too high, generally setting ten workdays per mu (in fact, five or six are enough). The above tendencies are all caused by not seriously mobilizing the masses and conducting in-depth inspections.
　　C. Work point system. Yishui and Pingxi sub-districts both have this type of form. Among them, the partial implementation of the method of substituting work for rice is beneficial to encouraging martyrs' and soldiers' families to produce, or hiring people to cultivate themselves, and improving efficiency. The Jianping sub-district has recently discovered that a few villages have also implemented similar methods of substituting in-kind for work. If this method is used by the determined tenant farming households to take shortcuts and unilaterally convert the work into rice money and the conversion is very low, which damages the production of the martyrs' and soldiers' families, it is of course not good; but if it is implemented under the conditions of mutual benefit and voluntariness, it is acceptable, especially the organized or through cooperative pilot implementation of the tenant farming method of substituting grain for work, it can also be promoted to research and pilot.
　　D. Temporary assignment system. Generally reported to be bad, no need to repeat, should be gradually changed.
　　Looking at the above several main forms of tenant farming, each has its advantages and disadvantages, so it is impossible to promote or emphasize only one form in one area, and it is even more inappropriate to prescribe only a few methods for the masses to follow. The correct principle should be to mobilize the masses, promote democracy, and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses according to the specific conditions and requirements of each region and each household, and adopt appropriate and effective methods to solve the tenant farming problem.

　　察省代耕工作经验及问题
    赵  洪
    （一）
    从察省建屏、雁北、易水、平西四个分区的材料看，今年代耕工作均有很大成绩，在代耕形式上并有新的发展。易水分区有不少的地区已解决了代耕问题或正在解决。建屏分区，也大力改进了代耕工作，故在察哈尔老区的大部地区，数年来搞不好的代耕工作，现在已逐渐合理解决。
    建屏分区主要是推行了包产量、订合同的包耕制。至五月初，建屏、平山、井陉、曲阳四县，共计一二二五村，已实行包耕制的有七三六村，已确定了代耕对象和代耕亩数，正在评产量、订合同的二六九村，尚未固定代耕的一七一村。灵寿五区共五十村，已有三十八村定好包耕办法，并在受代耕地边插一木牌，书明地亩、产量、包耕人及烈、军属姓名，以便随时检查。行唐、阜平、灵寿三县也已大部建立了包耕制。
    建屏五区实行包耕制的方法与过程是：（一）通过各种组织首先宣传解释包耕制的好处，并调查、登记烈、军、工属的户数、土地与劳力。（二）推动群众自找对象自由组织进行包耕。（三）最后评产量、订合同。
    建屏分区在推行组织代耕中，结合检查了以往瞒工、匿报人力、畜力的本位主义，并清算总结了旧工，整顿健全了勤务制度，实行了严格记工、评工、齐工等制度。由于组织代耕中宣传解释工作的深入，因而更密切了群众与烈、军属的关系。所以今年的代耕工作，烈、军属和广大群众均极满意，在生产中已见显著成效。
    易水分区代耕的形式共分四种：（一）包工制。即评定烈、军属应代耕的亩数和工数，由其自找亲朋或其他合适的人，在双方自愿原则下，实行固定包工；代耕者依权减免其他勤务。（二）包种制。大体同于建屏分区办法。（三）工票制。确定应代耕的烈、军属工数后，发给工票，用工时凭票到村公所支领工资米（一般的每工五——六斤），所用之米按全村劳动力摊派；烈、军属如积极生产省了工票，也可领米。这种办法基本上是以粮代工的办法，颇受欢迎。（四）派工制。零要零派。这种办法最坏，多流行于新区或工作基础差的地区。
    平西分区，许多地区推行了工票制。其具体办法又各不同。宛平把烈、军、工属按生活状况、劳力，划分三等，按等级发给工票；涞水全县普遍实行按季评工，分季发票，这样更细致；房山下滩村更具体地按各烈、军属的整半男女劳力，规定代耕亩数，发给工票，由其自找对象，一般都找的亲朋邻居双方自愿，并以活记工，大大刺激了代耕人的积极性，烈、军属因劳动节省了工票，齐工中找价。
    雁北分区代耕形式也大体分三种：即包工、包种、和派工。其中以包工最受欢迎，包种推行尚少。灵邱大涧村则用合作社解决代耕。
    （二）
    察省代耕工作的成绩是很大的，但也有不少地区仍然存在很多问题。如最近建屏地委及雁北的灵邱等县委进行了代耕工作的检查，发现今年的代耕工作，较往年虽有很大进步；但由于领导上的行政命令作风及官僚主义，致使代耕工作尚未普遍做好，并有若干问题，需待立刻解决。
    （一）由于领导上宣传教育不够，村干部及群众尚未真正认识代耕工作的意义，以致代耕工作并未认真、普遍贯彻，村干部还有嫌麻烦，及群众敷衍的态度。据检查，井陉四区四十三个村，只有四个村实行了包耕，十八个村是拨零工，二十一个村基本上还未贯彻代耕工作。建屏分区的不少地区，代耕队员还强要烈、军属管饭，不管饭便不代耕；平山东回舍一个代耕组长说：“你哄我肚皮，我哄你地皮”。北泽营两户烈、军属，因管不起饭，至今只用了两个工。有些村干部嫌麻烦，或者不认真贯彻代耕，强调群众代耕任务重，以致不少地区发生代耕面过小的偏向，甚至欺骗上级，报告说代耕工作做好了，但实际上根本未做。新区干部强调军属代耕问题不大，对代耕表现放松；或者便是认为布置下去就算完成任务，不督促不检查，以致不少虽然订了合同，但流于形式。如井陉威州五街有一队员包耕着二亩麦地，一次水也未浇，将麦旱坏，自己的麦子却浇了两次水。
    （二）推行代耕工作中，还有行政命令的恶劣作风，这也是使得代耕不能普遍有效贯彻的重要原因之一。如在建屏分区的有些地区，订合同时采取了行政命令，干部包办的办法。平山寺庄、孟岭村，区里发下合同后（这办法很不妥当），村干部不经代耕户，与被代耕户民主讨论、自由协商、双方同意，即找了个识字的捏造填好，报到区里，如同支应差事。因此，有些代耕户便轻视合同的信用，订了合同后，仍不认真执行。
    （三）代耕形式的研究。代耕形式原可根据各地、各户具体条件而有多种多样，领导上不必要也不应该做统一地规定。否则就会形成行政命令的做法。建屏地委提出的两个原则（根据条件解决实际问题、自愿、两利），三个办法（大包耕、小包耕、固定工），两个原则是好的，但三个办法则必须根据具体情况而定，不能硬性推广。浑源县委好象还在强调包产量的办法。因此，对各地代耕形式，须做认真研究，正确批判。
    甲、包产量的包耕制，建屏分区曾大力推行。据专署报告：全区这种形式占总代耕的四分之一，浑源及其他地区也有这种办法。但这种形式：第一，一般的只应适用于孤寡无劳力的烈、军属，不宜普遍采用。第二，这种办法推行起来有许多困难，如一般群众怕赔本，“只愿包工、不愿包粮”的现象非常普遍。另外在烈、军属方面也有顾虑，怕秋后无保证，怕吃不到瓜、菜、豆角了等等，开始推行这种办法，必会遇到许多分歧和纠纷：首先是在产量上的争执，其次是在水费、肥料等垫本上争执等。所以，什么地方成功地执行了这种办法，必然是在深入宣传解释，实行民主讨论、自由协商、双方自愿地具体解决各种问题中才能达到，如浑源鹅鸭泉村就是这样。
    乙、固定包工制。这种办法普遍反映较好，既可增强代耕者的责任心，又可发扬烈、军属的生产积极性，百且比较简便易行。建屏分区有一半是采取此种形式。但是这种办法的做好，也在于领导正确和发动群众。如目前已发现如下各种偏向极应注意：第一，某些村干部要私情，不是经过民主评议，而是干部一手包办，致有不公平、不合理现象。第二，村干部闹本位，向上级假报户数、亩数、工数，企图减轻本村负担。这种情形下，对烈、军属的代耕就有过高过低的偏向。如浑源七区普遍地决定代耕工太高，一般的每亩定十个工（实际上有五、六个足够）。以上偏向，均为没有认真发动群众，和深入检查所致。
    丙、工票制，易水、平西分区均有这类形式。其中部分的实行以工代米办法，对鼓励烈、军属生产，或自己雇人耕作，提高效率，均有好处。建屏分区近发现少数村庄亦有实行。类似的实物顶工的办法。这种办法如果是被确定了的代耕户，为了取巧而片面的将工折为米款而且折合得很低，损害了烈、军属生产，当然是不好的；但如果是在两利、自愿的情况下实行则是可以的，尤其是有组织地或通过合作社试行以粮代工的代耕办法，还可提倡研究试办。
    丁、临时派工制。普遍反映不好，不必赘述，应逐渐改变。
    综观以上几种主要的代耕形式，各有利弊，因而就不能在一个地区只推行或只强调一种形式，更不宜只规定几个办法让群众照办。正确地原则应是按照各地区、各户的具体条件和要求，发动群众，发扬民主，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，采取适合地、有效地办法解决代耕问题。
