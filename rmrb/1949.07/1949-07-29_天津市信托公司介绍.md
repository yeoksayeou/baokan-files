　　Tianjin Trust Company Introduction
　　Our Tianjin Reporting Team
　　The liberation of Tianjin opened the barriers to the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in the vast areas of North China and various liberated areas. Therefore, at the beginning of the liberation, many people from various places came to Tianjin to conduct industrial product transactions and procurement, especially military, government, and civilian organizations and groups from various liberated areas, forming an unorganized, unplanned, and multi-headed procurement situation. They neither understood the market conditions nor had the complex transaction experience of large cities; furthermore, the procurement personnel's simple task view of not paying attention to the level of cargo prices and the quality of goods gave speculators an opportunity to fluctuate prices, causing huge losses to our public finances. To this end, the Tianjin Trading Company established the Trust Company on February 6th based on objective needs. The company's mission is to conduct unified procurement on behalf of various regions, eliminate the contradictions of chaotic purchasing competition; and to promote the finished products produced by various public and private factories, as well as the local products transported from neighboring friendly regions, in a planned manner. In short, it uses the strong public and private funds and planned control of the import and export of goods to combat speculative merchants manipulating the market, so as to stabilize market prices.
　　Based on the general policy of operation, the company has stipulated and divided itself into six business sections and operating methods, which greatly solves the many difficult conditions for merchants from afar. (1) Agency buying and selling business: The company divides agency buying and selling into four trading rooms according to their nature: hardware, chemical pigments, department stores, and electrical materials. The trading method is that both buyers and sellers conduct transactions publicly at the company; the buyer first classifies and registers the purchase order to the relevant trading room, which is responsible for negotiating with the seller. The seller also classifies, lists, and marks the prices of the goods for sale. If necessary, they can prepare small samples or specimen drawings for viewing and price negotiation. All transaction procedures are handled by the company, which only charges a slight handling fee of 0.5% for the purchaser and 1% for the seller.
　　(2) Warehouse business: In order to facilitate the storage of goods by both buyers and sellers, a warehouse is specially set up, entrusted to a dedicated person for safekeeping or handling packaging on their behalf.
　　(3) Agency for savings and loans: In order to avoid merchants depositing large amounts of money in private banks, silver houses, or commercial firms for speculative profits, which would disrupt the unified management of the market, the company provides deposit services. All depositors are paid interest in accordance with bank regulations; however, the company may also grant small mortgage loans to purchasing and consignment customers who have necessary special difficulties, and interest is also paid in accordance with bank regulations.
　　(4) Self-operated business: In order to solve the temporary needs of purchasers, the company operates a part of the main, daily-needed popular goods, such as gasoline, kerosene, soda ash, sacks, hardware, cigarette paper, white sugar, and glass, for the urgent use of merchants.
　　In addition to the above four types of business, the company is now actively planning to handle transportation and hotel services to solve the various difficulties of merchants from afar and save manpower and material resources, which will be completed soon.
　　Due to the relatively careful setting of various departments that facilitate operation, and the powerful administrative management to cooperate with it, the company has achieved significant results in its operation in the past four months (February to early June). The scope of its transactions includes the five major liberated areas of Northeast, North China, Northwest, East China, and Central China. In the past four months, only the main materials purchased on behalf of various regions are calculated, such as sacks, coarse granulated sugar, gasoline, cement, soda ash, rubber tires, cigarette paper, glass, and tobacco, etc., nineteen kinds of goods sold to the North China region are worth 965,940,000 yuan; the Northeast region is 157,360,000 yuan; the Northwest region is 32,050,000 yuan; the East China region is 245,020,000 yuan; and the Central China region is 78,080,000 yuan; totaling a huge amount of 1,478,472,054 yuan, plus the total purchase volume of 1,398 kinds of commodities such as western medicine, chemicals, pigments, hardware, and electrical materials, is worth 2,475,456,457 yuan.
　　At the same time, the number of local products shipped from various liberated areas for exchange is also considerable, such as 399,701 catties of various sugars and 210 tons of wood from the Northeast; 77,859 catties of tobacco leaves from East China; 12,050 catties of green hemp from Central Hebei, and even more grain from various places. All were handed over to the company for consignment sales, opening up a broad road for material exchange between urban and rural areas.
　　The company not only satisfies and facilitates the requirements of purchasers from various regions and cracks down on speculators, relatively stabilizing prices; but also, based on the principle of "developing production, prospering the economy, and taking into account both public and private interests," plans to promote the finished products produced by various public and private factories in a planned manner, accelerating their capital turnover. According to current statistics, 100 factories have established transaction relationships (15 state-owned factories and 85 private factories). In addition, it also appropriately takes care of the sales of goods of various commercial firms, and 372 of them have established transactions. According to the company's statistics in May, the company promoted the finished products of state-owned factories, including 300 tons of cement from the North China Cement Factory, 129 tons of pig iron from the Tangshan Steel Plant, more than 100,000 porcelain heads from the Qixin Porcelain Factory, and a part of the wires from the Zhongtian Electric Factory. Private factories include 16,000 bags of soda ash and 200 barrels of caustic soda from the Yongli Factory; 50,000 sacks from Dongya; and more than 2,000 yards of paper-making mud from the Renli Factory. At the same time, some private factories have been able to start operations with the help of the Trust Company to promote finished products, including the Zhongtian Telephone Factory, the Sanjiang Oil Factory, the Tailai Industrial Factory, the Zhenli Iron Factory, and the Rubber Shoe Factory.
　　The company has achieved great results in its operations for more than four months; however, because the industry is still newly built and lacks skilled experience; at the same time, most of the cadres have never done economic work in the past, so there are still several problems in business operations that urgently need attention and overcome.
　　First of all, the company and other specialized companies have not yet achieved organic connection and mutual cooperation, so that when operating goods feel lacking, they cannot get strong support and assistance from various brother companies; at the same time, the local products entrusted by various regions to the Trust Company for consignment sales are often difficult to promote due to lack of help. For example, Henan once transported millions of catties of grain entrusted to the Trust Company to sell and exchange for a batch of machinery and daily necessities. The company handed over the grain to the Grain Company for sale, but did not seek a good solution, which affected the development of the business. In addition, customers entrust the purchase of gauze, hardware, pigments, knitwear, toothbrushes, etc., which should be respectively sought to help purchase from the city's Cotton and Gauze Company, Department Store Company, and Pingjin Coal and Iron Company, but because a good relationship has not been established, the care between each other is very poor.
　　Second, some cadres have a low level of Marxist-Leninist theory and lack understanding of the nature, business policy, and role of the Trust Company; at the same time, there are still remnants of narrow localism, so the profit-making concept exists in certain specific issues. For example, when purchasing 50 boxes of paper for a certain agency in Chahar, the price per box was 340,000 yuan when receiving the goods, and the price increased to 360,000 yuan when delivering the goods, earning a total profit of 1 million yuan. There was also the purchase of iron plates, gasoline, and steel pipes for the East China Railway Bureau. At that time, the price of goods was cheaper, but after the goods were stored for a month, the price rose, and the company's cadres delivered the goods at the increased price, which caused great dissatisfaction among the purchasers (it has been corrected later); some cadres felt unwilling to do transactions without handling fees (some customers can directly purchase with the permission of the Trust Company, but they must go through transaction procedures after the purchase), and did not realize that this is a political task to grasp market prices and eliminate speculation and manipulation.
　　Third, most of the cadres are transferred from rural political power organs or newly joined the work from schools, so the enterprise-oriented business thinking is very poor, and the style of the agency is manifested everywhere. First of all, the attitude towards buyers and sellers is indifferent, and they will not warmly entertain them. Some people are even unwilling to give a cigarette or pour a glass of water; the operating style is sluggish and slow. For example, the Pingjin Railway Department entrusted the company to purchase iron pipes, which has not been completed in seven days. The guest house set up by the company mechanically stipulates the fixed time for meeting, eating, and sleeping, and the registration system for asking for leave when going out, so that merchants are unwilling to stay. Some merchants do not understand the company's office hours and transport a batch of goods after get off work, which resulted in rejection and ordered to be transported back. These all affect better uniting merchants, and more or less cause some difficulties in vigorously developing business.
　　Fourth, the company cannot yet achieve an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the supply and demand relationship of the market and the market law, so the control of prices is not timely in individual cases. For example, the electricity purchased on behalf of Lao Da was 1,100 yuan, but people can buy it for 900 yuan on the market; for example, buying glass for the Jizhong Administrative Office costs 15,000 yuan per box, but people can buy it for 14,000 yuan on the market. The company has now reviewed and paid attention to this issue and is working hard to overcome it.

　　天津市信托公司介绍
    本报天津报导组
    天津的解放打开了华北广大地区城乡间与各解放区物资交流的障碍。因而，刚解放之初各地来天津进行工业品交易采购者繁多，尤以各解放区军、政、民各机关团体为数更多，形成了无组织、无计划多头采购状态；既不了解行情，又缺乏大城市复杂的交易经验；再由于采购人员的不注意货物价格的高低和质量的优劣的单纯任务观点等，给商人以投机之隙，致物价波动，使我公家财政所受损失为数巨大。为此，天津市贸易公司根据客观的需要，特于二月六日成立了信托公司。该公司的任务是代各地统一进行采购，消灭乱购竞争的矛盾；并有计划地代为推销各公营私营工厂出产的成品，以及各友邻区运来的土产品。总之，运用公私雄厚的资金和有计划地掌握货物的吞吐。从而打击在市场上的投机操纵的商人，以稳定市场价格。
    该公司依据了经营的总的方针，规定并划分为六个业务部分和经营方式，这大大地解决了远道而来的客商的诸多困难条件。（一）代客买卖业务：该公司将代客买卖依性质分为五金、化颜、百货、电料等四个成交室。其成交方式是买卖双方到公司公开进行交易；买方先将采购货单分类登记缴有关的成交室，由该室主持与卖方进行协商。卖方出售货物亦分类挂牌登记标价，必要时可备妥小样或标本图样以便看货论价。其成交的一切手续由公司代办之，只抽采购者百分之点五与出售者百分之一的轻微手续费。
    （二）仓库业务：为便利买卖双方存放货物起见，特设仓库，托专人保管或代为办理包装。
    （三）代办存贷贷款：为避免客商大批货款存入私人银行、银号或商号内，借作投机营利，致扰乱市场统一管理，该公司代办存款。凡存款者均按银行规定付与利息；但采购与代售客人，因必须的特殊困难者，该公司亦可酌予小数的抵押贷款，亦按银行规定付息。
    （四）自营业务：为解决采购者临时的需要，该公司自营一部主要的、日常需用的大路货，如汽油、煤油、碱面、麻袋、五金、烟纸、白糖、玻璃等，以便客商急迫所用。
    除以上四种业务外，现该公司正积极筹划代办运输业务和旅店业务，以解决客商远地而来的各种困难，节省人力物力，不日即可完成。
    该公司由于较为周密地设置了便利于经营的各部门，和行政上有力的管理相配合，故四个月来（二月至六月初），其经营获致了显著成绩。其成交的范围包括东北、华北、西北、华东、华中等五大解放区。四个月来，仅就各地区代购的主要物资计算，如麻袋、粗沙糖、汽油、洋灰、碱面、胶轮带、卷烟纸、玻璃、烟叶、纸烟等十九种计销于华北区价值合九六五、九四○、○○○元；东北区合一五七、三六○、○○○元；西北区三二、○五○、○○○元；华东区合二四五、○二○、○○○元；华中区合七八、○八○、○○○元；总计达一、四七八、四七二、○五四元巨大的数额，再加上西药、化学、颜料、五金、电料等零星计达一、三九八种商品的总采购量，共值二、四七五、四五六、四五七元。
    与此同时，各解放区为了交换而源源运来的土产品为数亦相当可观，如东北运来的各种糖类达三九九、七○一斤，木料计二一○吨；华东的烟叶计七七、八五九斤；冀中的青麻一二、○五○斤，以及各地来的粮食为数更大。均交该公司代为推销，替城乡物资交流开拓一条广阔的道路。
    该公司不但满足和便利了各地采购者的要求，打击了伺隙投机的商人，相对地稳定了物价；而且是本着“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾”的原则，有计划地代为推销各公私营工厂出产的成品，加速其资金流转。据目前统计，和工厂发生成交关系者为一○○家（国营厂十五家，私营八十五家）。此外又适当地照顾到各商号货物的推销，与之发生成交者计三七二家。据该公司五月份的统计，替国营工厂推销成品者计华北水泥厂之洋灰三○○吨，唐山炼钢厂之元铁一二九吨，启新磁厂磁头十万余个及中天电工厂的电线一部。私营工厂计有永利厂碱面一六、○○○包，火碱二○○桶；东亚麻袋五○、○○○条；仁立厂造纸泥二千余码。同时还有私营厂通过信托公司代为推销成品的帮助而得以开工者有中天电话机厂、三江油脂工厂、泰来实业厂、振利铁工厂、胶皮鞋工厂等家。
    该公司在四个多月的经营中是获得了很大的成绩的；但由于该业尚是初建，没有熟练的经验；同时，大部分干部过去根本没有作过经济工作的，因之，经营业务中尚存在几个问题是急待注意与克服的。
    首先是该公司和其他专业公司尚没有做到有机的连系和相互间的配合地步，致使经营货物感到缺乏时，得不到各兄弟公司的有力的支持与协助；同时各区所委托信托公司代售的土产品亦因缺乏帮忙而常感推销困难。如河南曾运来百万斤粮食委托信托公司代卖后换回一批机器及日用品，该公司将粮食交与粮食公司出卖，但没有求得很好的解决，影响了业务的开展。此外，还有客商委托代买纱布、五金、颜料、针织、牙刷等均应分别与该市花纱布公司、百货公司及平津煤铁公司求得帮助购买，但因没有建立起很好关系来，彼此间的照顾是很差的。
    第二，部分的干部由于马列主义的论理水平低和对信托公司的性质、业务方针及其作用缺乏认识；同时还存在狭隘的本位主义的思想残余，因此，营利观点在某些具体问题上是存在的。如给察哈尔某机关代购五十箱盘纸，收货时每箱价三十四万元，缴货时增价为三十六万元，此次共获利一百万元。还有代华东铁路局购买的铁版、汽油、钢管子，当时物价较便宜，但存货一月后，其价格上涨，该公司的干部以上涨后的价格缴货，致引起采购者很大的不满（后已纠正）；还有的干部对没有手续费的成交（有的客商经信托公司允许可直接采购，但采购后必须办成交手续）感到不愿意做，而没有认识到这是掌握市场价格消灭投机操纵的政治任务。
    第三，大部分干部是从农村的政权机关调来或从学校里新参加工作的，因之企业化的经营思想是很差的，处处表现着机关化的作风。首先表现在对买卖者态度是冷淡的，不会热情的招待，甚至有些人连让一根纸烟和倒一杯开水都不愿意作；表现在经营作风上是疲塌，迟慢，如平津铁道部委托该公司购买铁管，七天还没有完成。该公司所设的招待所，机械的规定会客、吃饭、睡觉的一定时间和出门请假登记的制度，致客商都不愿留居。还有的商人，不了解该公司的办公时间，且在下班后运来一批货物，结果遭到了拒绝接收，令其运回。这些均影响着更好的团结客商，对于大力的开展业务上或多或少地造成了一些困难。
    第四，该公司尚不能作到深入的、全面的了解市场的供求关系和市场规律，致掌握价格在个别情况下还不及时，如代劳大买的电线为一、一○○元，但人家在市上九○○元即可买得；如给冀中行署代买玻璃每箱一五、○○○元，结果人家在市上一四、○○○元即买得。该公司现已检讨和注意这个问题，正极力克服中。
