　　National Literary and Art Workers' Victorious Grand Meeting
　　Bai Sheng

　　On July 2, 1949, in Beiping—the sacred birthplace of the "May Fourth" Movement—the unprecedented victorious grand meeting of progressive literary and art workers from across the country took place. As every speaker at the conference unanimously pointed out, such a grand meeting would not have been possible without the great victory of the people's revolution.

　　The representatives attending this conference included literary and art workers from North China, Northwest China, East China, Central China, Northeast China, South China, and various military units. There were people's poets, novelists, folk artists, playwrights, filmmakers, painters, musicians, dancers... Some came from the ranks of workers, peasants, and soldiers, growing up in the heat of battle, while others were intellectuals who participated in or were sympathetic to the revolution, and former artists. This great torrent converged from all directions, forming a powerful cultural army.

　　In the conference hall, everyone's face was smiling, filled with boundless joy and excitement, and the atmosphere was full of victory and unity. The magnificent portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu shone brightly, watching over everyone in the hall. On the rostrum, the conference emblem, decorated with six red flags and featuring profile images of Chairman Mao and Lu Xun, hung high. More than forty banners presented to the conference expressed the hope for literary and art workers: "Literary and art workers across the country, unite under the banner of Mao Zedong, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly," "Integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers," "Write for the people"... This is Chairman Mao's direction. In the past, present, and future, this direction has been and will be emitting victorious light and fruitful results in our great motherland. On both sides of the rostrum walls were embedded two white reliefs, one depicting four PLA soldiers advancing in heroic combat, and the other depicting a combination of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This symbolizes the direction of literary and art work. At the rear of the hall was a finely sculpted plaster statue of Chairman Mao—a symbol of China's victory.

　　The conference began with the resounding song of "The East is Red." After Chairman Guo Moruo delivered an enthusiastic and joyful opening speech, the entire assembly paid tribute to the revolutionary literary workers who died for the revolution. The hall was silent and solemn, and everyone was thinking of the martyrs who died for the people, nurturing the people's cause with their blood. Their glorious achievements will be immortal.

　　Commander-in-Chief Zhu addressed the conference on behalf of the Communist Party of China. All the representatives immediately stood up, and the warm applause lasted for a long time. The Commander-in-Chief nodded kindly and modestly to everyone.

　　Representatives from various democratic parties, the People's Government, the People's Liberation Army, and people's organizations delivered warm and enthusiastic speeches to the conference, congratulating the victory and success of the conference.

　　Zhu Xuefan, representative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said: In the past, under reactionary rule, the Chinese working class was unwilling and unable to speak freely, nor was it willing and able to write freely; today, under the great victory of the Communist Party of China, the working class and literary and art workers are united and heading towards the direction of a New Democratic society together.

　　Li Xiuzhen, an old lady representing the liberated peasants of North China, moved all the representatives with her speech. She talked to everyone about the land reform and the emancipation of the peasants in the liberated areas. She said: "The trees were planted by the poor, and the land was cultivated by the poor. It is only right that the land should be returned to the people." She earnestly requested the comrades engaged in literary and art work, whether writing or performing, to do things that are beneficial to the peasants, so that everyone would act accordingly. She said: This is the demand of the people. If it is not beneficial to the people, we cannot have it... Warm applause sent her off the rostrum, and her excited words still echoed clearly in people's ears.

　　Li Jian, Chief of Staff of the Special Forces of the North China Military Region, presented a banner to the conference, and the band played music. When the red banner was unfurled on the rostrum, the large characters "The Soldiers Place Limitless Hopes On You" appeared. The great People's Liberation Army's emphasis and hope for literary and art workers moved and inspired all the representatives present. After presenting the banner, Comrade Li Jian delivered a speech, representing the soldiers to ask the literary and art workers to unite with them and write for them.

　　Finally, all the representatives sang the song "Unity is Strength," and then the adjournment was announced.

　　全国文艺工作者胜利大会师
    柏生
    一九四九年七月二日，在北平——“五四”运动发祥的圣地，全国进步的文艺工作者空前胜利的大会师了，象这样的一个大会师，正象大会的每一个发言人所一致指出的：如果没有人民革命伟大的胜利，就不会有这一天。
    参加这次大会的代表，包括了华北、西北、华东、华中、东北、南方等广大地区和部队中的文艺工作者。有人民的诗人、小说家、民间艺人、戏剧电影家、画家、音乐家、舞蹈家……，他们有的来自工人、农民、士兵的队伍中，在火热的战斗中生长起来，有的是参加革命或倾向革命的知识分子、旧艺人等。这伟大的洪流，从四面八方汇合起来，形成有力的文化大军。
    会场里，每个人的脸都是笑着的，都呈现着无限的愉快与兴奋，到处充满胜利团结的气氛。毛主席、朱总司令的巨大画像英彩焕发地注视着会场里所有的人。主席台上高挂着六面红旗装饰着的有毛主席和鲁迅侧面像的大会会徽，四十余幅赠送给大会的锦旗道出了对文学艺术工作者的希望：“全国文学艺术工作者团结在毛泽东旗帜下，全心全意为工农兵服务”“与工农兵结合，为工农兵服务”“为人民写作”……这是毛主席的方向，过去、现在和将来，这个方向已经和即将在我们伟大的祖国中，发出胜利的光辉，丰硕的成果，主席台的两侧壁上嵌着两块白色的浮雕，一面塑着四个解放军战士前进的战斗雄姿，另一面塑着工、农、兵结合在一起的图形。这标志着文艺工作的方向。在会场的后方布置着一个精雕的毛主席石膏塑像—中国胜利的象征。
    大会在响亮的“东方红”的歌声中开始。主席郭沫若兴奋欢悦的致了开幕词以后，大会全体代表为革命文学工作死难的烈士致哀，会场沉默肃穆，每一个人都在想着为人民而死的先烈们，以自己的热血培育了人民的事业，他们的光辉业迹，将永垂不朽。
    朱总司令代表中国共产党向大会讲话了，全体代表立即起立，热烈的掌声长久不息。总司令和蔼地、谦虚地向大家微点着头。
    各民主党派、人民政府、解放军、人民团体等的代表，都先后亲切热烈地向大会致词，祝大会的胜利和成功。
    全国总工会代表朱学范说：过去在反动统治下，中国工人阶级不愿意与不可能自由地说话，也不愿意与不可能自由地写文章；今天在中国共产党伟大胜利下，工人阶级与文艺工作者结合起来了，共同走向新民主主义社会的方向。
    华北翻身农民代表李秀贞老太太的讲话，感动了全场的代表，她向大家谈到解放区农村中的土地改革，农民的翻身，她说：“树是穷人栽的，地是穷人开的，土地还家是理应该的。”她恳切的要求作文艺工作的同志，不论是写东西、演戏都好，就是要对农民有利的，大家才照那样作。她说：这是人民的要求，对人民没有利的，咱们就不能要。……热烈的掌声，将她送下主席台，人们的耳里还清晰的震荡着她激动地话语。
    华北军区特种兵部队参谋长李健向大会献旗，乐队奏起乐来。当红色锦旗在主席台上展开时，现出了“士兵寄以无限热望”几个大家。伟大的人民解放军对于文艺工作者的这种重视和热望感动鼓舞了在场所有的代表们。献旗以后，李健同志致词，代表士兵要求文艺工作者和他们结合，为他们写作。
    最后，全体代表唱起“团结就是力量”的歌声，接着就宣布休会。
