    As the people of all countries are increasingly and actively involved in the movement to defend peace, the increasingly isolated American imperialism is making greater efforts to strengthen its despicable espionage activities. In late June, Truman signed a bill to strengthen the Central Intelligence Agency, which had been established two years earlier. This overseas spy agency is a secret tool for American warmongers to promote their plans to invade the world. In addition to directing special agents sent by the State Department and the Marshall Plan Administration, the most important task of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency is to buy and use national scum, traitors, and union-boss scabs from various countries, whether openly or secretly. This U.S. spy headquarters will "concentrate its efforts on activities in the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and China" (Agence Telegraphique Est). The intensification of such covert sabotage by American reactionaries has aroused serious vigilance among the people of all countries. As long as the people of all countries do not slacken their high vigilance, the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism are bound to fail. Recent examples include Poland's trial of the American and British spy Doboczynski, Hungary's arrest of the traitor and former Foreign Minister Rajk, and the Bulgarian Communist Party's purge of the traitor and former Deputy Prime Minister Kostov.
    Under the instigation and encouragement of U.S. imperialism, the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek flew to Baguio in the Philippines on the 10th to hold two days of secret meetings with the U.S. stooge and Philippine President Quirino, to carry out criminal activities against the Chinese people. According to foreign news agencies, the main contents of the Chiang-Quirino talks were twofold: one was the issue of organizing a "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance," and the other was the issue of the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits fleeing to the Philippines to "establish a government-in-exile." According to Philippine Foreign Secretary Neri, the so-called "Pacific Alliance" will be composed of a "core" formed by the three puppet governments of the Kuomintang, the Philippines, and South Korea, and then gather reactionaries from other Far Eastern countries to participate. This "alliance" "relies on the support of the United States in both spirit and material." The Filipino people and all progressive Philippine public opinion have issued strong condemnations of Quirino's adventure. A delegation of Manila workers held a demonstration in front of the Presidential Residence on the 11th, shouting: "Quirino and Chiang Kai-shek are puppets of the United States."

### 美帝竭力加强间谍活动引起各国人民严重警惕  美帝走狗蒋季图继续反人民

    美帝竭力加强间谍活动引起各国人民严重警惕
    美帝走狗蒋季图继续反人民
    当世界各国人民越来越多和越来越积极地卷入保卫和平运动的时候，益形孤立的美国帝国主义，就更竭力加强它的卑鄙的间谍活动。六月下旬，杜鲁门签署了加强已经设立了两年的中央谍报处的法案。这一遍布国外的特务机关，是美国战争贩子推行其侵略世界计划的不可告人的秘密工具。美国中央谍报处除了指挥由国务院和马歇尔计划总署派出的特务官员之外，最重要的是收买和利用各国或明或暗的民族败类、叛国分子和工贼首领。美国这一间谍首脑部将“集中力量在东欧新民主国家、苏联和中国进行活动”（电通社）。美国反动派加紧这种秘密破坏活动，已引起各国人民的严重警惕。只要各国人民不松懈自己的高度警惕性，美帝国主义的阴谋是一定要失败的。最近，波兰之审讯美英特务多鲍琴斯基案，匈牙利之逮捕叛国分子前外长拉伊克，保加利亚共产党之清洗叛徒前副总理科斯托夫，就是眼前的实例。
    在美帝国主义的策动与鼓励之下，匪首蒋介石于十日飞到菲律宾的碧瑶，与美国走狗、菲总统季里诺举行了两日秘密会议，进行继续反对中国人民的罪恶活动。据外国通讯社报道，蒋、季会谈的主要内容有二：一是关于组织“太平洋反共联盟”问题，一是关于国民党残匪逃至菲岛“建立流亡政府”问题。据菲外次尼奈扬言，所谓“太平洋联盟”，将由国民党、菲律宾与南朝鲜三个傀儡政府组成“核心”，然后纠合其他远东国家的反动派参加。这个“联盟”，在“精神与物质上均有赖于美国的支持”。菲律宾人民与全菲进步舆论，对于季里诺的这一冒险，均发出强烈的申斥。马尼拉工人代表团于十一日在总统寓邸门前举行示威，高呼：“季里诺与蒋介石是美国的傀儡”。
