The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Decides to Unify Worker Newspaper Correspondence Work in Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan

　　[Ping City News] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently issued a decision on unifying the worker newspaper and worker correspondence work in the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan: 1. After the Worker's Daily of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is published, all worker newspapers that have been published or are being planned for publication by the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan Federations of Trade Unions, or worker supplements published in other newspapers, will be discontinued. 2. The interviewing and correspondence cadres dispatched by the Worker's Daily to the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan will form the interviewing and correspondence groups of the Worker's Daily in those areas, responsible for interviewing workers' movements and organizing and cultivating worker correspondents in each city. The correspondence groups in each city should maintain close contact with the Federation of Trade Unions in each city. The manuscripts of worker correspondents from factories and industries in each city, after being reviewed by the correspondence groups, will be sent directly to the Worker's Daily, and a copy will be sent to the Federation of Trade Unions in that city for reference. Manuscripts to be broadcast nationwide will be sent by the Worker's Daily to the Xinhua News Agency in Beiping.
    Trade union cadres at all levels and in all industries, especially the staff of the trade union's cultural and educational departments, must regularly write for the "Worker's Daily" and must also regularly organize and lead worker correspondents to write.
