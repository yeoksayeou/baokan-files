Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 3rd: Reports from various sources indicate that the U.S. Department of Defense announced on June 30th: "The withdrawal of American troops from South Korea has been completed, but a military advisory group led by Brigadier General Roberts will continue to be stationed in South Korea." This marks the formal staging of the grand hoax of the American military's "withdrawal" from South Korea, which has been continuously clamored about by U.S. government officials and reactionary newspapers in recent months. In reality, the so-called U.S. "troop withdrawal" from South Korea is merely a ploy to conceal the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to enslave South Korea long-term under a new guise.

As is well known, the U.S. government and its occupation authorities in South Korea have repeatedly rejected the Soviet government's and the Korean people's proposals for the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. As early as September 1947, the Soviet government proposed to the U.S. government that Soviet and American troops simultaneously withdraw from Korea. This proposal, as well as subsequent Soviet proposals for withdrawal, were unreasonably rejected by the U.S. government. On September 10, 1948, the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea passed a resolution demanding that the Soviet and U.S. governments simultaneously withdraw their troops. The Soviet government issued a note of consent on September 19th, announcing that Soviet troops would complete their withdrawal before January 1, 1949. However, the U.S. government rejected the legitimate demands of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea. Despite this, the Soviet Union completed the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from North Korea on December 25th of the same year. The continued occupation of South Korea by American troops has aroused resolute opposition from the Korean people, especially the South Korean people. The South Korean people have launched an armed struggle against the Syngman Rhee puppet government and demanding the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. The scale of this armed struggle is expanding daily. This situation has forced U.S. imperialism to consider changing the facade of its naked occupation apparatus in an attempt to alleviate the dissatisfaction of the Korean people. After careful planning, the American occupiers decided to replace the old occupation apparatus with a new institution to enslave the Korean people. This new institution is the "Korean Military Advisory Group" and the Syngman Rhee puppet government under its control. In a note to the Syngman Rhee government on June 8th, U.S. Ambassador to the Syngman Rhee puppet government, Muccio, announced that the U.S. government had decided to establish an "expanded Korean Military Advisory Group" after the "withdrawal." The head of this advisory group will still be the current commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, Roberts, with a total of 500 members. On June 10th, Muccio announced in a note to Syngman Rhee that the group had been formally established. Moreover, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Webb revealed during testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on June 8th that the U.S. military had transferred a considerable amount of "surplus military materials," including a large number of light weapons and ammunition, to the Syngman Rhee government during the "withdrawal." Syngman Rhee's puppet government's ambassador to the United States, Chang Myon, claimed on June 14th that the U.S. government's plan for military assistance to South Korea would soon be submitted to the U.S. Congress. The need for Korean weapons has been listed as an important item. In addition, as the so-called Economic Cooperation Administration's $125 million "aid to Korea plan" for this year came to an end on June 30th, Truman submitted a message to Congress on June 7th proposing an expanded "aid to Korea plan" of $150 million for the next year. In his message, Truman openly declared that South Korea should be turned into an "anti-communist testing ground." Truman's "aid to Korea" proposal is currently being discussed in the U.S. Congress.

These facts demonstrate that, under the guise of the so-called "withdrawal," U.S. imperialism is clearly strengthening its ruling apparatus in South Korea and intensifying its economic and military "aid" to the Syngman Rhee puppet government in order to enslave South Korea for the long term.

### 美帝演出“撤军”大骗局　阴谋长期奴役南鲜

　　美帝演出“撤军”大骗局
  　阴谋长期奴役南鲜
    【新华社北平三日电】各方报道：美国国防部于六月三十日宣布：“美军自南朝鲜之撤退工作，业已完成，但由罗伯兹准将率领之军事顾问团，将继续留驻南朝鲜。”这是最近数月来美国政府官员及反动报纸不断喧嚷美军自南朝鲜“撤退”的大骗局的正式演出。实际上，所谓美国自南朝鲜“撤军”只是用来掩盖美帝国主义在新的伪装下长期奴役南朝鲜的阴谋。
    如所周知，美国政府及其在南朝鲜的占领当局，曾数次拒绝苏联政府与朝鲜人民关于美军撤离南朝鲜的建议。早在一九四七年九月，苏联政府即曾向美政府建议苏、美军队同时撤离朝鲜。这一建议以及苏联政府以后多次的撤军建议，均为美国政府所无理拒绝。一九四八年九月十日，朝鲜最高人民议会通过决议，要求苏、美两国政府同时撤军。苏联政府于九月十九日发出同意的照会，宣布苏军决于一九四九年一月一日以前完成撤退。但美国政府却拒绝了朝鲜最高人民议会的正当要求。虽然如此，苏联仍于同年十二月二十五日完成了全部苏军自北朝鲜的撤退工作。美军之继续占领南朝鲜，引起了朝鲜人民，尤其南朝鲜人民的坚决反对。南朝鲜人民展开了反对李承晚傀儡政府及要求美军撤退南朝鲜的武装斗争。这一武装斗争的规模正日益扩大。这一情势，迫使美帝国主义不得不考虑将它的赤裸裸的占领机构加以改头换面，以图缓和朝鲜人民的不满。美国占领者在周密布置之后，决定以新的奴役朝鲜人民的机构来代替旧的占领机构。这个新机构便是“朝鲜军事顾问团”及受其控制的李承晚傀儡政府。美国派驻李承晚伪政府的大使缪西奥于六月八日致李承晚政府的照会中，宣布美国政府已决定在“撤军”后设立“范围扩大的朝鲜军事顾问团”。这个顾问团的团长，仍由现任驻南朝鲜的美军司令罗伯兹担任，团员共达五百人之多。六月十日，缪西奥在致李承晚的照会中，宣布该团已经正式成立。不仅如此，美副国务卿韦伯六月八日在众院外委会作证时透露，美军在“撤退”时业已将相当数量的“剩余军用物资”，包括大量轻型武器与弹药在内，移交给李承晚政府。李承晚伪政府的驻美大使张勉六月十四日并声称，美国政府军事援助南朝鲜的计划，不久即将提交美国国会。朝鲜的武器需要，已列为其中的重要项目。此外，在所谓经合总署本年度一亿二千五百万美元“援韩计划”于六月三十日告终之际，杜鲁门已于六月七日咨文国会，提出下一年度一亿五千万美元的扩大“援韩计划”。杜鲁门在咨文中公开扬言要把南朝鲜变成“反共的试验场”。杜鲁门的“援韩”建议，现正在美国国会讨论中。
    这些事实说明，美帝国主义在所谓“撤军”的掩盖之下，显然正在加强其在南朝鲜的统治机构，并加强其对李承晚傀儡政府经济与军事的“援助”，以便长期奴役南朝鲜。
