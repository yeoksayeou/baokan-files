　　Chen Xiuzhen is a hardworking woman from Changtun Village, Anping. In her thirties, she is quite sturdy, and speaks in a loud, clear voice, with a straightforward temperament, earning her the nickname "Iron-Faced and Impartial." She cultivates ten and a half mu of land year-round, taking care of everything inside and outside the home herself. In less than three years, she has managed her small life quite prosperously, and everyone praises her as a capable hand at getting rich.

　　Earlier, there were three sisters-in-law in the family, with six or seven children in total, cultivating over ten mu of land, and life was unbearable. In the second year of the Anti-Japanese War, they encountered a bad year, and the elders separated her and her four-year-old daughter to live independently. Her husband joined the district work team that year, and the village, in the spirit of caring for the families of soldiers, helped her find two rooms to settle down temporarily, and rented two and a half mu of land from a landlord. In this way, in addition to the grain harvest, she also relied on her weaving skills, weaving with a shuttle to earn money to support her and her daughter's lives. She could weave a dense and even cloth, working from sunrise to sunset.

　　Later, after rent reduction and land reform, she was allocated a plot of land for a homestead, with two brick houses and a large shed, and eight mu of good land were added. How could this not inspire her to even greater productive enthusiasm! She once said at a mass meeting: "Our family has been liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party. If we don't work hard in production, how can we be worthy of Chairman Mao!"

　　Although she is the family member of a soldier, she does not solely rely on the village to help with cultivation. She leads her ten-year-old daughter, one pulling the livestock, the other holding the plow, to cultivate the land. She hoes the ground with great strength, often saying, "Don't be afraid of being slow, be afraid of stopping," and "Slow work produces fine craftsmanship." As time went on, the seedlings she hoed were evenly spaced, and she would pull out any weeds by hand.

　　In the courtyard she was allocated, there was an old, collapsed pigsty. She re-excavated it, and with the help of her daughter, carefully rebuilt it with some old bricks, following the original design. In order to accumulate manure, she exchanged the two large pieces of cloth she had for a pig to collect manure. She still felt that the fermentation was not good enough, so she picked up a manure basket and, no matter how late she stayed up weaving at night, she always got up very early with the stars, carrying the basket and walking the main roads and small paths, going through the front and back streets to pick up manure, always filling the basket before returning. In the summer, during the breaks from hoeing, she cut a lot of green grass, carrying it home in two large baskets. Often, the load was so heavy that she could barely make it home, taking off her small coat to cushion her shoulders and slowly carrying it back. She was even more meticulous about the bedding for the manure, spreading it evenly layer by layer. If anything was not right, she would level it with an iron shovel. Not far from the door was a water pit, and the work of watering the pigsty was often done after dinner, scooping water one load at a time onto the manure before resting. When it came time to empty the pigsty, she rarely took time off from busy work, often digging it out under the moonlight. Each year, she could accumulate seven or eight pigsties of manure, and each mu of land would be fertilized with at least four or five cartloads of manure. The crops grew lush green and black, and the grain harvest was always abundant. The villagers all said: "Land is iron, manure is steel, Old Chen's crops are a good example."

　　The year before last, she gave birth to a son, and her daughter was also sent to school. Her husband could not often be at home, so things were a bit stretched. She invited her seventy-year-old father-in-law to take care of the children, and at the same time, life improved, allowing the old man to eat well and enjoy his later years. She also made arrangements for planting crops, planting three or four mu of wheat every year as usual, and planting more than half a mu of cotton near the village. There was also some millet and sorghum on the land both near and far. In this way, she staggered the plowing, hoeing, and harvesting. Before going to the fields, she first fed the children, and then went to work, dividing each half-day into two sections, first working far away until mid-morning, then returning home to breastfeed the children, and then hoeing the nearby fields, so that she didn't waste any time. The cotton field at her doorstep, hoeing, pruning, picking branches, and topping were often done in the gaps between other tasks. Following the principle of "hoeing cotton six or seven times, the bolls grow as big as bowls," she harvested over a hundred catties every year, which she personally spun and wove into cloth during the spring and winter seasons to pay for oil, salt, and vegetables.

　　During last year's land reform, there were more than two mu of sandy land in the east of the village whose ownership had not been determined, and it remained barren even in the rainy summer. She discussed this matter with the cadres many times, but the masses all said: "Relying on sandy and barren land, planting anything is a waste of seeds." She then found Song Dashan, a neighbor, and together they worked hard hoeing the seedlings. During the midday break, braving the scorching summer heat, they spent three afternoons sweating profusely and laboriously planting buckwheat. At harvest time, each family received more than one dan, which supplemented their regular meals and allowed them to vary their diet. The delighted Song Dashan said: "One drop of sweat, one grain of millet, only by enduring hardship can we have sweetness."

　　Once, while she was hoeing the ground, she saw three young men hoeing the corn seedlings for Li Da Niang, the family member of a soldier, hoeing as fast as they could, not removing the weeds thoroughly, and after each row, lying down in the shade of a tree to sleep. She thought, how can they deceive people like this and be worthy of the family member of a soldier? So she dropped her own work and quietly walked over there. Without saying a word, she bent down and began to hoe, carefully hoeing away the weeds they had left behind. By the time they woke up, she had already hoed three rows. Under her influence, everyone felt their mistakes, got up, and continued to work patiently and meticulously. This matter reached the ears of the village cadres, who specially came to broadcast it over the loudspeaker, educating the village's cultivation team. Li Da Niang also found her, saying with great emotion: "If you hadn't put in so much effort for me, wouldn't they have ruined it?"

　　In their village, many families who raised pigs and sheep still did not pen them up when the crops grew tall, allowing them to trample the crops in the fields. Even repeated broadcasts to stop them had little effect. During a midday break, she gathered the young men on the street, carrying nets for catching rabbits, and went to the fields to round them up. They carried the three sheep and the large pig they caught back to the village. Because of this matter, the cadres convened a conference. In addition to having the families whose pigs and sheep were caught publicly declare to the masses that they would pen them up properly in the future, they also jointly discussed and established a public agreement prohibiting the grazing of sheep and pigs. Everyone said: "If Chen Xiuzhen hadn't come up with this method to make a fuss, it would have been difficult to completely prohibit it."

　　She is always concerned about everyone's production and is determined to make a success of it. She is currently accumulating wealth to prepare bricks and wood, planning to build a wall; she is also trying to add a stone mill to accumulate more manure!

    陈秀珍是安平长屯村的一个勤劳妇女。年纪三十多岁，长的挺壮实，说个话矮老婆高声，是个直爽的脾气，人们送给她一个“铁面无私”的称号。常年价种着十亩半地，连里带外都是自个照料和经营。没有三年的工夫，把小日子整理得挺发旺，谁都称赞她是起家过晌的能手。
    早先，家里妯娌三个，光孩子就有六七个，种有十几亩地，生活没法再混下去。抗战的第二年，赶上年头不好，老的便分出了她和四岁的女儿单独过活。她丈夫在那年就参加区里工作，村里在照顾抗属的精神下，帮助找了两间房，暂且先安身；并租种了地主的二亩半地。这样，除了收成的粮食，还靠着自己有织布手艺，用拉梭织起来，两头见太阳，可以织一个又密又匀的布，用来赚个钱维持她母女两人的生活。
    以后，经过减租和土地改革分到了一块庄基，带着二间砖房和一个大厦子，又添上了八亩好地，这怎不鼓舞了她更高的生产情绪呢！她曾经在群众会上说：“俺家在共产党的领导下翻了身，若不好好地努力生产，怎么对得起毛主席呢！”
    她虽然是个抗属，却不光依靠村里帮助代耕。自己领着十岁女儿，一个人拉着牲畜，一个人扶犁来耕地。锄起地来，很有力气，还常说：“不怕慢，就怕站，，”“慢工出巧匠”。日子长了，一样锄的苗儿远近挺合适，有一根护苗草也要用手拔掉。
    在分得的那院里，原来有个倒塌了的旧猪圈，她重新挖出来，再用一点旧砖块子，和女孩儿按着原来的样子，好好的垛了起来。为着要攒粪，把原存的两个大布换成了一口猪来攒粪。她仍然觉着没有搀头＠酵不好，又背起了粪筐，不管晚上织布熬多长夜，终带着星星起得很早，背起筐来，转了大道走小道，前后街串个遍去拾粪，都是拾满一筐才回来。到了夏天，在锄地的空子里，铲了很多的青草，随时用两个大筐往家挑，常常是一股劲压的弄不到家，扒下小褂来垫在肩头上，慢慢的挑回去。她对垫粪草是更细密，一层一层的必须撒的很均匀，若有一点不合适，就会用铁锨扒平的。门前不远是个水坑，灌猪圈的活，多会也是晚饭后的事，一挑一挑的水舀在粪上面才会歇息。到起猪圈的时候，很少占正忙的工夫，常在月光底下把它挖出来。每年能积肥到七八圈，一亩地至少也得施上四五车粪，庄稼长的是崭绿又发黑，打的粮食都是数头子。乡亲们谁都说：“地是铁、粪是钢，老陈的庄稼就是好榜样。”
    在前年，她生了一个男孩，女儿也送到学里念书，丈夫又不能常在家，真有点脚手拉开了。她有个七十多岁的老公爷，便请过来照料孩子，同时日子也好起来，让老人家吃点好尽尽孝道。对于种庄稼上也有个安排，照例的年年种上三几亩麦子，靠村边种上多半亩棉花，谷子高粱远近地都有点。这样，就把耕、锄、收割的活参插开了。未曾下地先喂饱孩子，然后再去干活，每半天分成两截，先到远处做活到二八小上午，回家来一趟给孩子吃奶，便又到就近的地去锄，使它一点也不浪费时间。家门上的棉花地，锄、整枝、拿枝、打尖的活，多会也是差对着工夫去做。她本着“棉花锄上六七遍，长的桃子赛大碗”的办法去拾掇，年年摘上百十多斤，都是在春冬两间的季节里，亲手纺织成布，解决打油买菜的零用。
    当去年土地改革时，村东沙疙瘩上二亩多地，还没确定地权，到雨水连绵的夏天仍在荒着。她为这件事和干部们研究多次，群众们都说：“靠着沙瘠地，种上也是白费种籽。”她这才找到邻家宋大山，两人在忙着锄热苗。歇晌时间，冒着炎热的暑天，在血汗漓淋中，费尽三晌午耕种上了荞麦。到收成时，一家分了一石多，使着家常饭食得到了一些补充，并能变化着口味吃。欢喜的宋大山说：“一滴汗，一粒粟，吃得苦中苦，才有甜中甜。”
    曾有一次，在她锄地时，看到三个小伙子给抗属李大娘锄热苗棒子，锄得象跑一样快，草锄不净，每到一匝，便躺在树凉里睡下去。她想这样欺骗人家，怎能对得起抗属呢？便扔下了自己的活，悄悄的走到那里，一言未发弯下腰去就锄，重新将他们留下的护根草，好好的锄了下来。等到他们醒来，她已锄过三条垄。在她的影响下，谁也都感到了自己的过错，爬了起来，又耐心又细致的干了下去。这件事传到村干部的耳朵里，特地来了一次高房广播，教育了村代耕团。李大娘也找到了她，很感动的说着：“若不是你对我这样的费心，怎么不把他弄糟了呢？”
    她们村里很多养猪羊的人家，到庄稼长的很高时，依然不圈起来，到地里糟踏庄稼，即便多次的广播制止，也起的作用不大。她利用歇晌时，纠合了街上的小伙子们，拿着捉小兔的拉网，到地里去圈。他们把捉来的三只羊和大猪扛到了村里。为这个事，由干部召开了一个大会，除由被捉住猪羊的人家，当面向群众声明以后圈好外，并在共同商讨中，立下了禁止放羊猪的公约。大家都说：“若不是陈秀珍想这个法子闹一下，完全禁止是有点不大容易的。”
    她是无时不在关心着大家的生产，并以最大决心搞出个样子来。现正在积蓄资财制备砖和木头，打算筑起一道围墙；还在设法添一座石磨多攒一些粪呢！
