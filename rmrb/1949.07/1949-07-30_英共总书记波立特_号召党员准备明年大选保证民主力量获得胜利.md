Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 29th—TASS reports: Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, commenting on the Conservative Party's election platform and Churchill's speech, has called on Communist Party members to work hard to prepare for the general election to be held in July next year. He asked members in constituencies where the party has nominated candidates to strengthen their election preparations, and asked Communist Party members in all other constituencies to do their utmost to ensure that Labor candidates who truly oppose the Conservative Party and the right-wing Labor leaders are victorious. Pollitt pointed out: "The Conservative Party has once again embarked on the road to war." "The Conservative Party is determined to make the fullest use of the favorable conditions created for them by the Labor government's policies."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 29th: Reports from various sources: The British Conservative Party published a booklet entitled "The Right Road for Britain" on the 22nd, announcing the party's election platform. The party leader, notorious warmonger Churchill, also explained the party's election platform at a mass meeting in Wolverhampton on the 23rd. After acknowledging that Britain is facing the most serious economic crisis in its history, Churchill put forward the Conservative Party's program, demanding the abolition of nationalization at home, and raving about exerting pressure on communism throughout the world, taking new steps to strengthen the British Commonwealth of Nations, establishing permanent general staff departments in the capitals of various autonomous territories, and establishing a Federal Defence Committee to prevent the rise of national movements in the Far East. Churchill's speech was opposed by progressive youth in Britain. At the Wolverhampton conference, many young men and women held up placards with the words: "Join the peace crusade, not Churchill's brigade," "Churchill wants to reduce wages," "Churchill protects the profits of the tycoons," "No to warmongers." The London Daily Worker commented on Churchill's speech, saying: This is the futile effort of a bankrupt demagogue to sacrifice the people and save the doomed fate of the dying capitalist system. Behind the incitement in Wolverhampton lies the real threat of Conservative policy: to wage an anti-Soviet war, lower wages, lengthen working hours, reduce social services, engage in destructive competition, and weaken and crush British trade unions and the labor movement. This is the only solution to the economic crisis devised by the Conservative Party. The Daily Worker concluded: "The Conservative Party is the party of war, the party that supports fascism, the party that starves the people, makes them poor and causes mass unemployment, the party of the bourgeois landlord system and vested interests."

  　号召党员准备明年大选保证民主力量获得胜利
    【新华社北平二十九日电】塔斯社讯：英国共产党总书记波立特顷在评论保守党的竞选纲领与邱吉尔的演说时，号召共产党员努力准备将于明年七月举行的大选。他要求党员在党已举出候选人的选区，加强他们的选举准备，要求在所有其他选区的共产党员，尽最大努力，保证使真正反对保守党和右翼工党领袖的劳工候选人获得胜利。波立特指出：“保守党已再次走上战争的道路”。“保守党决心最充分地利用工党政府政策给他们造成的有利条件”。
    【新华社北平二十九日电】各方报道：英国保守党于二十二日发表题为“英国的正确道路”的小册子，宣布该党的竞选纲领。该党领袖著名战争贩子邱吉尔并于二十三日在窝维尔汉普顿的群众大会上对该党竞选纲领加以说明。邱吉尔在承认英国已面临其历史上最严重的经济危机后，提出保守党的纲领，要求在国内取消国有化，并狂吠要对全世界共产主义施行压力，采取新的步骤加强大英联邦国家集团，在各自治领首都设立常设参谋部，建立联邦防御委员会，以阻止远东民族运动的高涨。邱吉尔的演说遭到英国进步青年的反对，在窝维尔汉普顿大会上，许多青年男女向他高举标语牌，上面写着：“参加和平十字军，不要参加邱吉尔的旅团”，“邱吉尔要减少工资”，“邱吉尔保护大亨们的利润”，“不要战争贩子”。伦敦工人日报评论邱吉尔的演说称：这是破产了的煽动家徒劳无益地力图牺牲人民、挽救垂死的资本主义制度的破灭命运的演说。在窝维尔汉普顿煽动的背后，存在着保守党政策的真正威胁：进行反苏战争，降低工资，延长工时，减少社会服务，进行毁灭性竞争，削弱与粉碎英国职工会与劳工运动。这就是保守党所拟定的经济危机的唯一解决方案。工人日报结语称：“保守党是战争的党，是支持法西斯的党，是使人民饥饿、穷困与大批失业的党，是资产阶级地主制度和既得利益集团的党”。
