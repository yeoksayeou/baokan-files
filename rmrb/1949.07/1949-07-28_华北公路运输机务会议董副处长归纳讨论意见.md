　　North China Highway Transportation Mechanical Affairs Conference, Deputy Director Dong Wenxing of the Transportation Department summarized the discussion opinions on the 26th, stating: Under the new situation, automobile factories must pay attention to correcting the following deviations: (1) Eliminate the past phenomena of each going its own way, independent operation, and blind production; (2) Production plans must be formulated based on actual conditions such as manpower, material resources, and financial resources; (3) Break the idea of "completely relying on other systems and not needing to make and配 things themselves"; (4) Oppose empiricism; if one's own equipment is insufficient, one should not spend too much time experimenting with primitive manual methods. In terms of specific policies and tasks, each automobile factory should serve the automobile company; without leaving the company, add equipment to meet actual needs. Its tools must be modernized, and testing instruments should be installed. On the existing basis in North China, equip two repair and assembly plants; major factories in places such as Pingjin and Taiyuan should sort out old vehicles and old materials to revive dead machinery and dead vehicles. Finally, he pointed out that operations must be enterprise-oriented and cost accounting must be sound. In terms of organization and leadership, there are the following opinions: Repair and assembly plants and larger repair plants are directly led by the North China Highway Bureau. Repair plants and maintenance plants should have a division of labor; major repairs are handled by the repair plant, while medium and minor repairs are handled by the maintenance plant. Company factories should establish long-term contracts, and both parties should hold meetings, discuss, and supervise each other. Factories must ensure good quality of locomotives. The two parties should cooperate and work together for the transportation cause.

　　华北公路运输机务会议董副处长归纳讨论意见
    【本报讯】华北公路运输机器车务会议，二十六日由运输处董文兴副处长归纳讨论意见称：在新形势下，汽车工厂必须注意纠正下面几种偏向：（一）消除过去各自为政，独立经营，盲目生产的现象；（二）必须根据人力物力财力等实际情况，订立生产计划；（三）打破“完全依赖别的系统，不需要自己制配”的思想；（四）反对经验主义，自己设备不够的，不应花费太多时间去试验原始的手工方式。在具体方针和任务方面，各汽车工厂应为汽车公司服务；在不脱离公司的前提下，配合实际需要添设机具。其工具要现代化，并设试验仪器。在华北现有基础上，配备两个修配厂，平津太原等主要工厂，要整理旧车旧料，使死机械死车复活。最后他指出经营必须企业化，成本核算必须健全。在组织领导方面，有以下几种意见：修配厂和较大修理厂均由华北公路总局直接领导。修理厂与保养厂应该分工，大修人修理厂，中修、小修由保养厂负责，公司工厂应建立长期合同，两方面要相互开会讨论、督促，工厂要保证机车质量良好，两方配合，共为运输事业而努力。
