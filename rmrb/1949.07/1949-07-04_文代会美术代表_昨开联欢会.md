　　Literary Congress Art Representatives
  　Held a Get-Together Yesterday
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The art representatives attending the National Literary Congress held a get-together in Beihai Park yesterday (the 3rd). Over 80 art workers' representatives from the Northeast, East China, South China, North China, Tianjin, and the armed forces attended. At the meeting, they discussed the art work proposals to be submitted to the congress. Finally, someone suggested establishing a friendship association during the congress so that art representatives from various regions could further understand each other and jointly discuss art-related issues. The proposal was immediately adopted, and seven people were elected as organizers to be responsible for preparations. (Bu)
