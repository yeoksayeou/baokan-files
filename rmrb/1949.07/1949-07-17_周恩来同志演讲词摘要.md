    [Ping City News] Abstract of Zhou Enlai's speech at the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association:

    In his speech, Zhou Enlai emphasized that we must earnestly learn from the Soviet Union and continue to promote the spirit of internationalism and revolutionary patriotism. He said that the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is a victory for internationalism and revolutionary patriotism. He recalled the assistance the Soviet Union provided to the Chinese people's revolutionary cause in various periods over the past thirty years and said that the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War today is inseparable from the encouragement and education of the spirit of internationalism for us, and inseparable from the sympathy and assistance of the Soviet Union and the broad masses of people of various countries. If there had been no victory of the October Revolution, and if there had been no victory of the anti-fascist war with the Soviet Union as the main force in the Second World War, the Chinese people would never have had such a great and rapid victory. After World War II, it was precisely because the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, as well as the people of Europe, contained the main force of imperialism in the West, that we were able to achieve victory in the East where the imperialist forces were relatively weak. Zhou Enlai pointed out that proletarian internationalism firmly opposes bourgeois nationalism. He said: Our People's Liberation War has basically achieved victory. We are seeking liberation ourselves. We will definitely respect all nations that treat us as equals, and we are willing to establish equal and friendly relations with them. We adhere to Lenin's principle of national self-determination, oppose Han chauvinism, and oppose discriminatory policies against ethnic minorities such as Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Miao, Yi, and Li. Only proletarian internationalism can guarantee close cooperation between the people of all countries and fraternal friendship between all ethnic groups within the country. Then he pointed out that revolutionary patriotism and internationalism are essentially the same thing, both starting from the standpoint of the proletariat and the working people. New patriotism is the embodiment of internationalism within the scope of a country. The spirit of new patriotism is to love one's motherland, oppose reactionary, decadent things within one's own country that violate the interests of the people, love everything in one's own country that belongs to the people and conforms to the interests of the people, love one's own people, love the revolutionary party and revolutionary leaders; and at the same time love the people of other countries and the cause of people's revolution. Soviet patriotism encouraged the Soviet people to offer everything in the anti-fascist war, defend the motherland, and achieve a great victory; in the post-war construction, they intensified the completion of the five-year plan with selfless labor, so that their great motherland gradually moved from socialism to communism. This high degree of Soviet patriotism is a model we must learn from. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance fully conforms to the overall revolutionary interests of the Chinese people. Only U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek will oppose it. China's future construction is a long-term and arduous project. If we want to finally achieve national independence and liberation, we must transform the colonial and semi-colonial economy into a truly independent economy, and we must transform the country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. Today, after the military and political failure of U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, they are now conspiring to economically blockade us. We must be ideologically prepared for them to blockade us for ten or eight years and must be able to withstand this new test. We must strive to overcome this difficulty, and we will definitely be able to overcome this difficulty. The victory of our Chinese people has greatly encouraged the people of the world. If we can work hard to break the blockade and step up production and construction, just like the Soviet Union after the October Revolution, defeated the blockade and intervention of fourteen countries, and then implemented the New Economic Policy and successively completed three five-year plans, then our economy will definitely be independent, and in this way we will make a greater contribution to the peace-loving and democratic people of the world. Finally, Zhou Enlai thanked the great world proletariat and the revolutionary teacher of oppressed nations, Lenin, thanked Mr. Sun Yat-sen who advocated cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and implemented the policy of alliance with Russia, thanked the leader and teacher of the Soviet people and the working people of the world, Marshal Stalin, and thanked Chairman Mao who led the Chinese people to carry out the new democratic revolution and created a solid foundation for the further development of Sino-Soviet friendship.

    周恩来同志演讲词摘要
    【平市讯】周恩来在中苏友好协会发起人大会上的演讲摘要：
    周恩来在他的演讲中着重指出，我们必须认真学习苏联，继续发扬国际主义与革命爱国主义的精神。他说，中苏两国人民的深厚友谊是国际主义与革命爱国主义的胜利的证明。他回溯三十年来苏联在各个时期对中国人民革命事业的帮助后说，今天中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利，是和国际主义精神对我们的鼓舞与教育分不开的，是和苏联与各国广大人民对我们的同情援助分不开的，假如没有十月革命的胜利，假如没有以苏联为主力军的第二次大战的反法西斯的胜利，中国人民就决不可能有这样大这样快的胜利。在第二次大战后，正因为苏联和东欧各新民主国家，以及欧洲各国人民大众把帝国主义的主力牵制在西方，才使我们能够在帝国主义力量较为薄弱的东方取得了胜利。周恩来指出无产阶级的国际主义坚决反对资产阶级的民族主义，他说：我们的人民解放战争已经基本上取得胜利。我们是自求解放，我们对于一切以平等待我之民族，一定尊重它们，并愿与之建立平等友善的关系。我们坚持列宁的民族自决原则，反对大汉族主义，反对对蒙、回、藏、苗、彝、黎等少数民族的歧视政策。只有无产阶级的国际主义才能保证各国人民之间的亲密合作，和国内各民族间的兄弟般的友谊。接着他指出革命的爱国主义和国际主义在本质上是一个东西，都从无产阶级与劳动人民的立场出发，新爱国主义乃是国际主义在一个国家范围内的体现。新爱国主义的精神是热爱自己的祖国，反对自己国家内反动的腐朽的违犯人民利益的东西，热爱自己国家内一切属于人民和合乎人民利益的东西，热爱自己的人民，热爱革命的政党和革命领袖；同时又热爱其他国家的人民和人民革命事业。苏联的爱国主义鼓舞着苏联人民在反法西斯战争中提供自己的一切，保卫祖国，取得伟大的胜利；在战后的建设中，用忘我的劳动，加紧完成五年计划，使自己的伟大祖国从社会主义逐渐走上共产主义。这种高度的苏维埃爱国主义精神，是我们必须学习的模范。中苏友好同盟条约完全合乎中国人民的全面的革命的利益，只有美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石，才会反对它。中国今后的建设是长期艰苦的工程，我们要使民族最后获得独立解放，必须把殖民地半殖民地的经济变为真正独立的经济，必须使国家从落后农业国变为先进的工业国。在今天，美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派在军事和政治上失败之后，现在正从经济上阴谋封锁我们，我们要在思想上准备它封锁我们十年八年，必须经得起这个新的考验。我们要努力克服这个困难，而且一定能够克服这个困难。我们中国人民的胜利已经大大的鼓舞了全世界的人民，如果我们能够努力打破封锁，加紧生产建设，如同苏联在十月革命后，打败了十四个国家对它的封锁与干涉，接着便实行新经济政策，接连完成三次五年计划一样，那么我们的经济一定能够独立，这样我们对世界各国爱好和平民主人民便将有更大的贡献。最后周恩来感谢伟大的世界无产阶级和被压迫民族的革命导师列宁，感谢主张国共合作，实行联俄政策的孙中山先生，感谢苏联人民和全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师斯大林大元帅，感谢领导中国人民进行新民主主义革命并为中苏友谊进一步发展创造了巩固基础的毛主席。
