　　As the Chinese people commemorate the twelfth anniversary of the War of Resistance Against Japan, they cannot but seriously pay attention to the situation in Japan. It has been almost four years since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Not only has the defeated nation of Japan failed to thoroughly eliminate militarism and realize democratization in accordance with the Potsdam Proclamation and previous international agreements on Japan, but on the contrary, under the support of the United States, Japanese aggressive forces are making a comeback and once again becoming a threat to peace in the Far East and the world.

　　U.S. imperialism has adopted a policy of supporting Japanese aggressive forces and turning Japan into a U.S. arsenal and military base in the Far East. Many facts have exposed this policy, arousing condemnation from democratic public opinion in various countries. Xinhua News Agency has also made many exposures and criticisms. Here, we will only provide a comprehensive account of several important aspects of the U.S. policy of supporting Japan.

　　(1) Preserving the power of the Japanese Zaibatsu and using them as running dogs of U.S. monopoly capital

　　As everyone knows, the Japanese Zaibatsu were the economic foundation of Japanese militarism, the chief culprits in the aggression against China, and active supporters of initiating and conducting the war of aggression. Japanese Zaibatsu families such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Yasuda, Ayukawa, and Nakajima all developed through external wars of aggression, especially the war of aggression against China. According to the principles of the Potsdam Proclamation, these Zaibatsu forces must be permanently eliminated. However, under the protection of the United States, not a single Zaibatsu war criminal has been punished, and their assets have been completely preserved. Zaibatsu war criminals who were once arrested have been released by MacArthur one after another. According to a report by Japan's Jiji Press on April 7th this year, MacArthur has decided to reinstate Tadaharu Mukai, Katsuhisa Shimada, and another person, managers of Mitsui who had been purged, and will reuse other purged Japanese economic leaders in order to "utilize their experience." In November 1947, the Japanese Diet formally passed the "Law for the Elimination of Excessive Concentration of Economic Power," deciding to disperse the assets of the Japanese Zaibatsu. However, in January 1948, with MacArthur's consent, the Japanese government decided that the banks of the four major Zaibatsu – Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda – would not be included in the "elimination." All of Japan's financial activities are still concentrated in the hands of six major banks, including the Imperial Bank of the Mitsui group, the Shioda Bank of the Mitsubishi group, and the Osaka Bank of the Sumitomo group. Of the 1,200 Zaibatsu companies listed for dispersal, more than 300 have been "liberated" and "regained their freedom" in the past year after repeated cancellations by MacArthur. Since the beginning of this year, MacArthur has removed another 367 companies from the list. In this way, the Japanese Zaibatsu, the foundation of militarism, have not been greatly damaged.

　　The U.S. occupiers' preservation of the Japanese Zaibatsu is aimed at turning them into agents of U.S. monopoly capital, so that U.S. monopoly capital can control Japan through them and further monopolize the Far East market. In fact, U.S. monopoly capital today controls Japan's economic lifeline and controls all of Japan's major industrial sectors and foreign trade. The major companies of U.S. monopoly capital, granted the privilege of freely investing and acquiring property in Japan by MacArthur's headquarters, are pouring into Japan. In the past year, U.S. Ford Motor Company's investment in Japan's chemical and ceramics industries reached $350 million, while U.S. General Electric Trust's investment in Japan's electrical industry exceeded $400 million. Currently, U.S. Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation have controlled Japan's automobile industry, U.S. Mobil Oil Company has controlled Japan's oil industry, U.S. Westinghouse and Mobil Oil Company hold more than half of Mitsubishi's shares, General Electric Company holds 45% of Mitsui's shares, International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation holds 35% of Sumitomo Electric Chemical Co., Ltd.'s shares, and U.S. Lead Company holds more than half of Japan Chemical Co., Ltd.'s shares. U.S. monopoly capital has turned Japan into its Far East branch.

　　U.S. monopoly capital also monopolizes Japan's foreign trade. In Japan's total import volume in recent years, the proportion of American goods has consistently accounted for more than 90%. The goods exported from the United States to Japan are mainly cotton and other raw materials. After these raw materials are made into commodities by Japan's cheap labor, they are forced to be exported to Southeast Asia, Europe, and South America for sale. U.S. monopoly capital obtains double the profits from this process: first, it promotes the sale of surplus American raw materials; second, it dumps commodities manufactured with cheap Japanese labor. These profits sometimes reach as high as 300% to 1,100%. U.S. monopoly capital has turned Japan into a vassal state for extracting super-profits.

　　(2) Reusing Japanese aggressive forces

　　According to the Potsdam Proclamation, Japanese aggressive forces and militaristic forces must be thoroughly eliminated. However, under U.S. control for the past four years, Japanese aggressive forces still rule Japan today. In Japan, in addition to preserving the reactionary Emperor system, canceling Zaibatsu companies that should have been broken up, and preserving feudal landlord rule, the U.S. occupiers have adopted an intolerable policy of shielding and indulging Japanese war criminals. Many Japanese war criminals and fascists who participated in the war of aggression have not only not been arrested, but have also occupied important positions and been heavily used. Japan's current government – the Shigeru Yoshida government – is actually a government of war criminals. Shigeru Yoshida himself was at the top of the first list of Japanese war criminals announced by the War Criminal Investigation Committee of the Chinese Liberated Areas on December 15, 1945. Shigeru Yoshida was the Minister of Health and Welfare in the Yonai Cabinet in 1940, the Minister of Munitions in the Koiso Cabinet in 1944, and also one of the leaders of the Japanese fascist organization – the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Such an important war criminal should have been arrested and brought to trial. However, under MacArthur's protection, Shigeru Yoshida has actually occupied the important position of Prime Minister of Japan today, still riding on the heads of the Japanese people, acting mighty and blessed. Among the major war criminals who have been arrested, except for a few who were sentenced to death by international tribunals under pressure from world public opinion, most of the arrested war criminals have been released by MacArthur one after another without authorization. In June 1946, MacArthur first released a group of major Zaibatsu war criminals who actively supported the war of aggression, including Narabin Ikeda and Ginjiro Fujiwara of the Mitsui group, Kiyoshi Goko of the Mitsubishi group, Toshinosuke Furuta of the Sumitomo group, and Masatsune Ogura, who served as an economic advisor to the puppet Wang Jingwei government. On August 31, 1946, MacArthur again released Inosuke Furuno, president of the Domei News Agency and advocate of the fascist war, and Yoriyasu Arima, advisor to the Great Japan Political Association. On August 30, 1947, MacArthur released another twenty-three important war criminals, including Yoshisuke Ayukawa, president of the former Manchuria Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., a Japanese munitions Zaibatsu who actively supported the war of aggression against China, Chikuhei Nakajima, the "aircraft king," and Tsugizo Kobayashi, the former Governor-General of Taiwan. On December 24, 1948, MacArthur released all nineteen Class A war criminals detained in Sugamo Prison, including Toshizo Nishio, former commander-in-chief of the China Expeditionary Army with blood on his hands of the Chinese people, Yoshio Kodama, former head of the Japanese intelligence agency in Shanghai, Eiji Amau, former Foreign Minister and President of the Information Bureau, Nobusuke Kishi, former Minister of Commerce in the Tojo Cabinet and one of the important rulers of Japan in Manchuria, and Kisaburo Ando, former Minister of the Interior in the Tojo Cabinet and Vice President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. In January 1949, MacArthur and Chiang Kai-shek colluded and released the main war criminal of the invasion of China, Neiji Okamura, and 260 other Japanese war criminals, sending them back to Japan.

　　(3) Re-arming Japan

　　Contrary to the dogmatic statement of the U.S. State Department on June 10, Japan's arms have not only not been "completely disarmed," but are being preserved and restored in a planned manner.

　　First, the United States has substantially preserved and restored Japan's war industry. The Strack Plan, published in March 1948, allowed most or all of the production of Japan's main military industries (such as aluminum, synthetic oil, oil storage facilities, including aircraft factories and ordnance factory machine tool manufacturing) to be retained. The Draper Plan, published in May 1948, further stipulated that Japan could produce 8.5 million tons of steel annually, which is 500,000 tons more than Japan's highest wartime production capacity, and more than twice the 3.5 million tons stipulated by the Far Eastern Commission. Since the end of last year, the United States has taken further steps to preserve and accelerate the restoration of Japan's war industry. After returning to the United States, the Hoffman Mission, which visited Japan last December, put forward a concrete plan to rebuild and expand Japan's steel industry, suggesting that Japan should be able to produce 11 million tons of steel, 6 million tons of pig iron, and 12 million tons of rolled steel by 1955. To achieve this goal, it was further stipulated that two-thirds of the scrap iron required by the Japanese steel industry would be supplied by the United States. On May 12 this year, the U.S. government issued a statement announcing the cancellation of the Japanese Interim Reparations Plan promulgated by MacArthur himself in April 1947, and stopping the dismantling of all Japanese factories used as reparations, including all munitions factories, aircraft manufacturing plants, and other basic war equipment factories.

　　Secondly, the United States is using various methods to rebuild Japan's aggressive military strength. Under the guise of expanding the police force, MacArthur is rebuilding the Japanese army. According to recent figures released by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, as of the end of October 1948, the Japanese police force had 141,200 people, not including railway police and secret police. Compared with the pre-war 65,000 people, this has increased by more than double, and more than two and a half times compared with the initial stage of the Japanese surrender. At the same time, MacArthur is planning to expand the Japanese police force to 300,000 people by the end of this year, which is 70,000 more than the total number of the pre-war Japanese army regular army. To complete this plan, the Japanese House of Representatives, with MacArthur's support, passed a bill to expand the Japanese police force on May 16. In reality, the Japanese police are completely disguised as the army. Most of the police are demobilized soldiers, and the organization and training of the police are similar to the army. Now, the reactionary Japanese government has established six police districts according to the division of the former six military regions, secretly training the Japanese army. At the same time, in order to equip the police with army equipment, MacArthur instructed his chief of staff and the Japanese government to start building secret arsenals throughout the country last spring. The warehouse of the former Japanese Nakajima Aircraft Company is one of the secret warehouses for storing large quantities of weapons and military supplies. Not only that, but the United States is openly preparing to organize the Japanese army. On December 30 last year, Soviet representative Pan Youxin revealed to the Far Eastern Commission that MacArthur had suggested in a report to the State Department to rebuild the Japanese army and re-arm Japan. The New York Times correspondent in Washington revealed on May 24: "The United States is carefully studying the proposal of former Commander of the U.S. Eighth Army Eichelberger to establish a Japanese defense force." Last spring, a paper by Hui published in a U.S. business magazine reported that "the new Japanese army under U.S. rule may appear at the end of this year."

　　The Japanese navy and air force are also being rebuilt. Since MacArthur allowed the Japanese to establish the "Maritime Safety Agency," which is similar to the Ministry of the Navy, in April last year, he has planned to increase the original 8,000 armed police officers to 10,000 and increase the original 38 ships to 135. At the same time, the United States is sparing no effort to train the Japanese air force and build a huge naval and air force base network throughout Japan. On December 11 last year, the United States United Press International revealed: "The United States has built many air force bases in Japan that can be used by the latest American aircraft, and has used many of the best naval bases in Japan." The article "The Miracle of Yokosuka" published in the U.S. "Newsweek" at the end of last year further exposed the U.S. conspiracy to build a large base network in Japan. The article pointed out: "The former Japanese naval base in Yokosuka is now the best-equipped headquarters of the U.S. Navy in the East. The site has three large floating docks, six smaller floating docks, and twenty cranes. Under this restoration, Yokosuka can adequately accommodate two aircraft carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, and sixteen destroyers. In an emergency, the size of this naval base can be quickly expanded several times."

　　With MacArthur's approval, it is well known that the Japanese invaders have used organizations such as "Fishermen's Associations," "Cooperative Farms," and "Development Groups" as cover to preserve a complete set of military organizations and a large number of military cadres for themselves. For example, the host of a "farm" in Hokkaido is the former Japanese Navy Marshal Yonai, and the personnel of the "farm" are all officers or soldiers who have taken off their military uniforms. Therefore, these organizations are only disguised barracks, and can form a combat force at any time. (To be continued)

　　美国保护日本侵略势力复活
    操良　王飞
    中国人民在纪念抗日战争第十二周年的时候，不能不严肃地注视日本的局势。抗战胜利已经将近四年，战败国的日本不但没有按照波茨坦对日公告及历次国际协定，彻底肃清军国主义和实现民主化；而且恰恰相反，日本侵略势力正在美国扶植之下卷土重来，重又成为远东和世界和平的威胁。
    美帝国主义采取扶植日本侵略势力，变日本为美国在远东的兵工厂和军事基地的政策，已经有许多事实暴露出来，引起世界各国民主舆论的斥责，新华社亦曾有许多揭发和抨击，这里我们只就美国扶日政策的几个重要方面作一综合的叙述。
    （一）保存日本财阀势力，充当美国独占资本的走卒
    尽人皆知，日本财阀势力是日本军国主义的经济基础，侵略中国的祸首，发动与进行侵略战争的积极支持者。三井、三菱、住友、安田、鲇川与中岛等日本财阀家族，都是在对外进行侵略战争，特别是侵略中国的战争中发展起来的。依照波茨坦公告的原则，这些财阀势力必须永久铲除。然而，在美国的庇护下，日本的财阀战犯没有一个受到惩办，财阀的资产亦被完整地保存下来。一度被捕的财阀战犯，都已先后被麦克阿瑟释放。据日本时事通讯社今年四月七日消息，麦克阿瑟已决定起用被整肃的三井经理向井忠晴与岛田胜久助等三人，并将重用其他被整肃的日本经济界领袖，以便“利用他们的经验”。一九四七年十一月，日本议会形式上通过了“经济力集中排除法”，决定分散日本财阀的资产。但至一九四八年一月，日本政府即经过麦克阿瑟的同意，决定三井、三菱、住友、安田四大财阀的银行，不在“排除”之列。日本现在一切的金融活动，依然集中在三井系之帝国银行、三菱系之盐田银行、住友系之大阪银行等六大银行手中。名列分散名单上的一千二百家财阀公司，经过麦克阿瑟的多次勾销，去年一年中已有三百余家被“解放”和“恢复了自由”。今年以来，麦克阿瑟又自该名单上勾销了三百六十七家。这样，作为军国主义的基础的日本财阀势力就没有受到多大损伤。
    美国占领者之保存日本财阀，是为了把它们变成美国独占资本的代理人，以便通过它们使美国独占资本得以控制日本，并进而独占远东市场。事实上，美国独占资本今天已控制着日本的经济命脉，控制着日本一切主要的工业部门和对外贸易。美国独占资本的各大公司，得到麦克阿瑟总部所给予的在日本自由投资与置产的特权，正在源源侵入日本。去年一年中，美国福特汽车公司对日本化学与陶器业的投资，即达三亿五千万美元；而美国电气机械托拉斯对日本电气工业的投资，则竟高达四亿美元以上。现在，美国的福特汽车公司与通用汽车公司已控制了日本的汽车工业，美国的美孚石油公司已控制了日本的石油工业，美国的威斯丁豪斯及美孚油公司已握有三菱过半数的股票，通用电气公司已握有三井全部股票的百分之四十五，国际电报电话公司已握有住友电气化学株式会社全部股票的百分之三十五，美国制铅公司已握有日本化学株式会社股票的半数以上。美国独占资本已把日本变成它的远东支店。
    美国独占资本同时也垄断了日本的对外贸易。在日本战后几年来的输入总额中，美货的比重一向占百分之九十以上。美国输至日本的物品，主要是棉花及其他原料。这些原料在经过日本贱价的劳动力制成商品以后，再强迫它输到东南亚、欧洲与南美各国去出售。美国独占资本从这样的过程中，获取双重的厚利：第一是推销了美国过剩的原料，第二是倾销了用日本便宜劳动力所制造出来的商品。这种利润有时竟高达百分之三百至百分之一千一百。美国独占资本已把日本变成了它榨取超额利润的附属国。
    （二）起用日本侵略势力
    按照波茨坦对日公告，日本侵略势力与军国主义势力，是必须予以彻底肃清的。可是，在美国四年来的管制下，日本侵略势力今天依然统治着日本。美国占领者在日本，除了保存反动的天皇制，勾销应予分解的财阀公司，保存封建地主统治等等以外，对于日本战争罪犯，更采取了令人不能容忍的包庇放纵政策。日本许多战犯与参加过侵略战争的法西斯分子，不但未被逮捕，而且盘据要津，受到重用。日本今天的政府——吉田茂政府，实际上是一个战犯政府。吉田茂本人在中国解放区战犯调查委员会一九四五年十二月十五日所公布的首批日本战犯名单中，即名列前茅。吉田茂是一九四零年米内内阁的厚生大臣，一九四四年小矶内阁的军需大臣，同时又是日本法西斯组织——大政翼赞运动的首领之一。这样重要的战犯理应加以逮捕，交付审判。然而，在麦克阿瑟的卵翼下，吉田茂今天居然盘据日本首相的要职，照旧骑在日本人民的头上，作威作福。在已被逮捕的主要战犯中，除了少数人在世界舆论的压力下，被国际法庭判处极刑以外，大部分就捕的战犯，都被麦克阿瑟先后擅自释放了。麦克阿瑟于一九四六年六月最先释放了一批积极支持侵略战争的主要财阀战犯，其中包括三井系之池田成彬、藤原银次郎，三菱系之乡古洁，住友系之古田俊之助，及曾任伪汪精卫政府经济顾问的小仓正恒。一九四六年八月三十一日，麦克阿瑟再次释放了法西斯战争的鼓吹者、日本同盟社社长古野伊之助，及大日本政治会顾问有马赖宁。一九四七年八月三十日，麦克阿瑟又释放了二十三名重要战犯，其中包括积极支持侵华战争的日本军需财阀前满洲重工业会社总裁鲇川义介，飞机大王中岛知久平，前台湾总督小林跻造等。一九四八年十二月二十四日，麦克阿瑟将拘押于巢鸭监狱的十九名甲级战犯，全部释放，其中包括手上沾满中国人的血的前中国派遣军总司令西尾寿造、前日本在上海的特务机关长儿玉誉志夫、前外相与情报局总裁天羽英二、前东条内阁商相与日本在满洲的重要统治者之一的岸信介、前东条内阁内相及大政翼赞会副总裁安藤纪三郎等人。一九四九年一月，麦克阿瑟和蒋介石狼狈为奸，又将日本侵华主要战犯冈村宁次及其他二百六十名日本战犯，释放遣送回日。
    （三）重行武装日本
    和美国国务院六月十日的武断声明相反，日本的武装不仅没有“已完全解除”，而且正有计划地被保存和恢复着。
    首先，美国相当完整地保存和恢复着日本的战争工业。一九四八年三月发表的斯揣克计划，允许日本主要的军火工业（如铝、人造石油、储油设备、包括飞机工厂兵工厂的工作机械制造等）的生产，大部或全部保留。一九四八年五月发表的德莱柏计划，更规定日本可年产钢铁八百五十万吨，这较日本战时最高生产能力还超过了五十万吨，较远东委员会规定的三百五十万吨竟超过了一倍以上。从去年年底以来，美国采取了进一步的步骤，以保存和加紧恢复日本的战争工业。去年十二月访日的霍夫曼代表团在回国以后，曾提出了重建和扩大日本的钢铁工业的具体计划，建议在一九五五年以前，使日本能产钢一千一百万吨，铣铁六百万吨，辗钢一千二百万吨。为达到这一目标，更规定日本钢铁工业所需之废铁，三分之二由美国供应。今年五月十二日，美国政府更发表声明，宣布取消一九四七年四月由麦克阿瑟自己颁布的日本临时赔偿计划，停止拆卸一切充作赔偿的日本工厂，其中包括所有的军火工厂、飞机制造厂以及其他基本战争设备的工厂。
    其次，美国利用各种方法重建日本的侵略军力。麦克阿瑟在扩充警察的伪装下，重建日本的陆军。据日本大藏省最近发表的数字，至一九四八年十月底，日本警察已有十四万一千二百人，铁路警察及秘密警察的人数尚未包括在内，这与战前的六万五千人相较，已增加了一倍以上，较日寇投降初期则扩大了两倍半。同时，麦克阿瑟正计划于本年底将日本警察扩充到三十万人，较战前日本陆军常备军的总数还多七万人。为完成这一计划，日本众院在麦克阿瑟的支持下，已于五月十六日通过了扩充日本警察武力法案。实际上，日本警察完全是伪装的陆军。警察大部分都是复员军人，警察的组训亦与军队相似。现在日本反动政府已按前六个军区的划分，设立六个警管区，秘密训练日本陆军。同时，为了配备警察以陆军的装备，麦克阿瑟去春即已授名其参谋长和日本政府，着手在全国建立秘密军火库。前日本中岛飞机公司的仓库，即为储藏大批武器与军用物资的秘密仓库之一。不仅如此，美国正公开地准备组织日本的陆军。去年十二月三十日，苏代表潘友新在远东委员会上揭露麦克阿瑟在向国务院报告中，曾建议重建日本陆军和重行武装日本。纽约时报驻华盛顿记者五月二十四日透露：“美国正在仔细研究美国前第八军军长艾奇柏关于成立日本国防兵团的建议。”去年春天美商业杂志登载胡伊的一篇论文报道，“美国统治下的新的日军，可能于今年底出现”。
    日本的海、空军也在重建中。麦克阿瑟自去年四月准许日寇成立类似海军省的“海上保安厅”以后，已计划将原有的八千武装警员扩增至一万人，将原有的三十八艘舰船增至一百三十五艘。美国同时又不遗余力地为日寇训练空军，并在日本全国建筑庞大的海空军基地网。去年十二月十一日美国合众社曾透露：“美国已在日本建造可供最新式的美国飞机使用的空军基地多处，并利用日本最良好的海军基地多处”。去年底美国“新闻周刊”所载“横须贺的奇迹”一文，更暴露了美国在日本建筑大基地网的阴谋。该文指出：“前日本在横须贺的海军基地，现在是美国海军在东方装备最好的总司令部。该地现有大活动船坞三个，较小活动船坞六个，起重机二十架，在这种恢复情况下，横须贺已能充裕地容纳航空母舰二艘，战舰二艘，巡洋舰四艘及驱逐舰十六艘，在紧急情况下，这一海军基地的规模，能迅速地扩大数倍。”
    在麦克阿瑟的批准下，日寇利用“渔民协会”、“合作农场”、“开拓团”等等组织为掩护，为自己保存了整套的军事编制，和大量的军事干部，更是尽人皆知的事。例如北海道一所“农场”的主持者，便是前日本的海军元帅米内，该“农场”的人员全是卸下了军装的将校或士兵。因此，这些组织只是变相的兵营，随时都可以组成一支作战的部队的。　（未完）
