　　*Su Daily* Comments on Production Summary Communiqué
　 Great Victory of the Second Quarter's Production Will Awaken the People's Patriotic Pride
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 24th] TASS, Moscow: All newspapers here on July 23 focused on the production summary communiqué for the second quarter of this year. Editorials in all newspapers unanimously stated that this communiqué will awaken a deep sense of patriotic pride in the hearts of the Soviet people.

    The *Pravda* editorial wrote: The average daily industrial output in June this year has exceeded the average level of 1940 before the war by 41 percent. This is a huge victory. Our industry is rapidly approaching the average daily output of the last year of the Five-Year Plan. The newspaper continued: The production achievements of the second quarter mark the selfless labor of millions of Soviet working people and the unprecedented scale and creativity of socialist competition. *Pravda* pointed out that laborious production processes have been further mechanized. This provides particularly favorable conditions for workers in socialist industry, guaranteeing them even richer production results in the second half of this year.

    The *Izvestia* editorial wrote: The achievements of the Soviet national economy convincingly prove once again Molotov's words: "The Soviet system guarantees every opportunity to continuously improve productivity and continuously improve the welfare of urban and rural working people, which does not exist and cannot exist in any capitalist country." *Izvestia* said: Capitalist countries are being tormented by their internal irreconcilable animosities and conflicts; they are either achieving nothing or regressing. The terrible specter of a new economic crisis is looming over the capitalist world.

　　苏报评生产总结公报
　  第二季生产巨大胜利将唤起人民爱国自豪
    【新华社北平二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：七月二十三日，此间各报皆集中注意今年第二季的生产总结公报。各报的社论一致声称：这个公报，将在苏联人民的心中唤起深深的爱国自豪感。
    真理报的社论写道：今年六月份工业的每日平均产量，已超过战前一九四零年的平均水平百分之四十一。这是一个巨大的胜利。我们的工业已迅速接近五年计划最后一年的每天平均产量了。该报继称：第二季的生产成绩，铭志着千百万苏联劳动人民忘我的劳动和社会主义竞赛的空前规模和创造力。真理报指出：辛苦费力的生产过程都已进一步机械化了。这给社会主义工业中的工人提供了特别有利的条件，保证他们今年下半年的生产成果更为丰富。
    消息报社论写道：苏联国民经济所达到的成就，令人信服地又一次证明了莫洛托夫的话：“苏维埃制度保证了不断提高生产力，不断增进城乡劳动人民福利的每一个机会，这是在任何一个资本主义国家所不存在，而且不能存在的”。消息报说：资本主义各国正为其内部不可调和的敌对和冲突所熬煎着，它们不是毫无成就，便是倒退。新的经济危机的可怕的幽灵，正笼罩着资本主义世界。
