North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Helps Gaoyang Cloth Find Sales Outlets
  　First Exchange of Three Million Jin of Northeastern Corn
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to support the production of Gaoyang cloth in central Hebei, the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative recently agreed with the Northeast Supply and Marketing Cooperative to exchange 4.2 million jin of corn from the Northeast for 10,000 bolts of Gaoyang cloth. There are about 10,000 looms in the area centered on Gaoyang (before the war, the number was several times greater). Over the years, due to restrictions on capital and sales, they have not been fully operational. Gaoyang cloth has excellent technology and innovative patterns. In the past, it was sold in Hong Kong, Xi'an, and the mountainous areas of the Northwest. After the War of Resistance, it was mostly sold in the rural areas of the Liberated Areas. From January to May of this year, a total of 130,000 bolts were put on the market, but only 90,000 bolts were sold. The number of private cloth shops and merchants was about 100 last year, but most have switched to other businesses this year. Last winter, the profit per bolt of cloth was 45 to 50 jin of millet, but it dropped to 26 jin in February of this year, and to 8 jin in early April. It only rose to 13 jin in mid-to-late April. The area suffered from floods last year, and this year there was a hailstorm, resulting in a severe shortage of grain. In order to help local farmers overcome difficulties and support possible rural handicraft production, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative has found a market for Gaoyang cloth in the Northeast and is conducting the first exchange. According to estimates from relevant parties, Gaoyang cloth will sell well in the Northeast. In addition to the cooperative vigorously organizing production, it can also drive private merchants to engage in business. The Central Hebei General Cooperative lacks funds at present, so it used 3 million jin of corn from the Northeast and a portion of funds to purchase 250 bales of cotton yarn (40 bundles per bale) in Tianjin. The trade company strives for low prices to support farmers' handicraft production. It is planned to initially restore 1,000 looms to operation. Preliminary estimates show that the labor cost per bolt can be 32 jin of millet, which is about double the wages in May and June.

    [Another report] The ten counts of coarse yarn previously sent from the North China Trading Company to eastern Hebei have no sales outlets (eastern Hebei mostly weaves fine cloth). The North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative recently transported 100 bales of ten-count coarse yarn from eastern Hebei to central Hebei and lent them to weaving households who are cooperative members to weave Zhuanlu cloth, which is estimated to be sold in Chahar and the mountainous areas of the Northwest after autumn.

　　华北供销合作总社
    替高阳布打开销路
  　首次交换东北玉米三百万斤
    【本报讯】华北供销合作总社为扶植冀中高阳布生产，最近与东北供销总社商定以东北的玉米四百二十万斤交换高阳市一万匹，以高阳为中心的四周共有织布机约一万张（战前尚大于此数倍）历年受资本与销路的限制，未得全部开工，高阳布技术颇佳，花样翻新，过去曾行销香港、西安及西北山地，抗战后则多行销解放区农村。本年一至五月上市共十三万匹，销出者仅九万匹。私人布店、商贩去年约为一百户，今年则大部转业。去冬每匹布的利润为四十五至五十斤小米，今年二月降至二十六斤，四月初则降至每匹八斤，中下旬始升为十三斤。该区去年遭受水灾，今年因曾有雹灾，粮食奇缺。为使当地农民顺利渡过困难，及扶植农村可能进行的手工业生产，刻供销总社已为高阳布寻得东北市场，进行第一次交换，据有关方面估计：高阳布将可畅销东北，除合作社大力组织生产外，并可带动私商进行经营。冀中总社由于目前缺乏资金，故以东北运来玉米三百万斤及一部分款在津购得棉纱二百五十件（每件四十捆）——贸易公司为扶植农民手工业生产，价格力求从廉——拟初步恢复一千张机子开工。初步估计每匹手工费可为三十二斤小米，较之五、六月份工资高出一倍左右。

    【又讯】前由华北贸易总公司发往冀东之十支粗纱，刻无销路（冀东多织细布）。华北供销总社最近以一○○件十支粗纱从冀东运往冀中，贷给织布户社员，织砖路布，估计秋后可销察哈尔及西北山地。
