　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 27th. The Hubei Provincial People's Government convened its first financial and economic conference from the 16th to the 20th of this month to arrange current financial and economic work. Zheng Zihui, Chairman of the Central Plains Provisional People's Government, Li Xiannian, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Wang Renzhong, Vice Chairman, and Wang Hongkun, Deputy Commander of the Hubei Military Region, all personally attended and provided guidance. Chairman Li Xiannian pointed out in his speech: Based on the situation in the province, the current work guidelines are determined to focus on rural work, mobilize the masses of farmers, and carry out democratic struggles against bandits and local bullies; within the organs, streamline the structure and transfer cadres to the countryside, while strengthening financial construction; transfer more than 20 percent of the cadres to participate in financial and economic work to ensure the supply of the army and lead the people in disaster areas to overcome famine. After detailed discussions in groups such as industry and commerce, banking, and finance, Vice Chairman Wang Renzhong made a summary and specifically arranged the future work tasks: (1) Organize the masses in disaster areas to produce and overcome famine. Due to continuous rain and the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, the river and lake embankments have been in disrepair for many years. Hubei Province has experienced severe floods this year, affecting more than three million people. Therefore, organizing production and disaster relief is the top priority of financial and economic work. In addition to the provincial government's decision to allocate 3 million jin of grain to help the people in the severely affected areas of Mianyang and Huanggang to overcome the famine, it was decided that each special commissioner's office should organize a production and disaster relief committee, and each county should establish a supply and marketing cooperative, with the county head serving as the director. Strong cadres from mass movement, industry and commerce, and trade should be selected to participate in organizing farmers, fishermen, and handicraft workers to produce and overcome the famine. The supply and marketing cooperatives must be responsible for supplying the people in disaster areas with daily necessities such as cheap grain, oil, and salt, and must be responsible for solving the sales channels for the sideline products of the people in disaster areas. (2) In order to stabilize prices, it was decided to expand the movement against the use of silver dollars from cities to the countryside. Each county can first carry out this movement in several major towns, and gradually promote it to create a mass movement against the use of silver dollars in the countryside, so that the RMB can occupy the rural market and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. (3) In terms of finance, on the one hand, it is necessary to complete the task of grain requisition and support the people's liberation cause; on the other hand, it is necessary to practice production and thrift, reduce expenditures, and promote organ vegetable growing and pig raising, and organize consumer cooperatives for workers, staff, public educators, and the army. At the same time, it is necessary to clean up finances, establish a strict centralized and unified financial system, and prohibit all unnecessary and non-compliant expenditures. In order to strengthen the leadership of financial and economic work, each special area should quickly establish a financial and economic committee, improve the organization of financial and economic departments, and financial and economic cadres, especially those in charge, should strengthen investigation and research, study policies, and master business, to ensure the completion of the above tasks.

　　鄂省召开首次财经会议
  　保证大军供应领导灾区渡荒
    【新华社汉口二十七日电】湖北省人民政府于本月十六日至二十日召开了首次财政经济会议，布置了当前的财政经济工作。中原临时人民政府主席郑子恢，湖北省政府主席李先念、副主席王任重，湖北军区副司令王宏坤等都亲自出席指导。李先念主席在讲话中指出：根据全省情况，确定目前工作方针，以农村工作为重点，发动农民群众，开展劫匪反恶霸的民主斗争；在机关内部则紧缩机构，抽调干部下乡，同时加强财政建设；抽调百分之二十以上的干部，参加财经工作，保证大军的供应，领导灾区人民生产渡荒。会议在分为工商、银行、财政等小组，进行了详细讨论之后，由王任重副主席作总结，具体布置了今后工作任务：（一）组织灾区群众生产渡荒。由于霪雨连绵，加以国民党匪帮的腐败统治，使江湖堤防多年失修，湖北省今年已发生严重水灾，灾民共达三百余万。因此组织生产救灾乃是财政经济工作的当务之急。除省府已决定拨粮三百万斤帮助沔阳、黄冈灾重地区灾民渡荒外，决定每一专署都要组织一个生产渡荒委员会，每个县都要成立供销合作社，由县长亲任社长，并抽出坚强的群众运动、工商、贸易等工作干部参加，以组织农民、渔民和手工业者生产渡荒。供销合作社须负责以廉价粮食、油盐等生活必需品供应灾民，并须负责解决灾民副业产品的销路。（二）为了稳定物价，决定将拒用银元运动由城市扩大到乡村。各县可先在几个主要城镇进行，逐渐推广，造成乡村的拒用银元的群众运动，使人民币占领乡村市场，并促进城乡物资交流。（三）财政上，一方面要完成征粮任务，支援人民解放事业：另一方面厉行生产节约，紧缩开支，提倡机关种菜、养猪，组织工人、职员、公教人员、军队的消费合作社。同时清理财政，建立严格的集中统一的财政制度，禁止一切不必要的与不合制度的开支。为加强财经工作领导，各专区应迅速建立财经委员会，健全财经部门的机构，财经工作干部特别是负责干部，应加强调查研究，学习政策与精通业务，以保证上述各项任务的完成。
