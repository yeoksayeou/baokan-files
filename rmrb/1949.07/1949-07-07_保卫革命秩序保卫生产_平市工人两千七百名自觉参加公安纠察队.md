　　To protect the city's revolutionary order, thwart counter-revolutionary activities of saboteurs, rapidly restore and develop production, and build a new Beiping, the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions called on city workers in early June to participate in patrol and public security work. By June 30th, 2,250 people had joined the patrol corps, and 487 people had joined the public security team. The new patrol members and public security members have been gathered into teams for study. This call issued by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions in early June received a resounding response among the vast number of workers in railways, mines, major factories, and various industries: "Join the patrol team and protect the new Beiping!" The administration, branches, trade unions, and Communist Youth League of various public factories conducted heated discussions. The municipal, district, and major production unit review committees were also established to ensure purity of composition and that age and physical condition met requirements. During the movement, special agents spread rumors and sabotaged, but these were exposed one by one by comrades working in various districts and factories. Repeated explanations were given to workers regarding the current situation, the nature and tasks of the People's Patrol Team and public security members. After liberation, workers stood up and their political consciousness was raised. They have a desire to defend the fruits of victory, and they said one after another: "In the past, Kuomintang military police bullied us and oppressed us. Now we are liberated, and we will turn around and control special agents and bad eggs, so that they can never turn over!" Therefore, the vast number of workers participated in the patrol teams extremely enthusiastically. After receiving the call from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, workers at Fengtai, Changxindian, Xizhimen, Qianmen and other stations of the Pingjin Railway Bureau competed to participate. Many of the workers in Xizhimen and Qianmen were veteran technical workers who did not care about high or low pay and ignored family concerns and repeatedly requested to participate. One hundred and eighty-seven workers from the above stations were approved to join the team. More than 300 workers from the Pingjin Clothing Factory signed up at one time, and more than 80 signed up the second time. Yang Jingshen, the deputy branch secretary of the factory, took the lead. Due to production needs and other conditions, 147 people from the factory passed the review, and many workers who were left behind repeatedly requested to participate. All the workers were very envious of those who had been approved to participate. More than 30 workers from the Qinghe Woolen Mill signed up, and 11 qualified to join the team. The family of worker Zhang Chenggui initially did not want him to participate, but he explained to his family: Participating in the patrol team is the same as working in the factory, and he can take care of the family. After signing up, he said to people: "The family is not a problem, as long as the factory leadership approves it." More than 100 workers from various mines in Mentougou voluntarily signed up to participate. All factories held send-offs for the team members when they left the factory, and welcomes were held when the new team members joined the team. The atmosphere was very solemn, and everyone's emotions were very high. In terms of the composition of the above-mentioned 2,100 new patrol members, industrial workers account for about one-third of the total, handicraft, shop assistants, and apprentice workers account for about one-third, and rickshaw workers account for about one-third. In terms of education level, the vast majority are elementary school level and those who have a smattering of literacy. Everyone's enthusiasm for learning is very high. After joining the team, each person was first issued half a month's salary of seventy-five catties of rice. In addition to using it for the family, everyone bought pens and notebooks to prepare for learning. During this mobilization, the workers showed a serious and responsible attitude towards the country. For example, during registration, some bad elements mixed in, and they were automatically exposed by the workers. After being concentrated into formations, all the team members have officially started learning. The first is to continue to improve their class consciousness, so that everyone's political understanding and class consciousness are further improved through complaining about the past and comparing lives.

　　保卫革命秩序保卫生产
  　平市工人两千七百名自觉参加公安纠察队
    【本报特讯】为保护城市革命秩序，粉碎破坏分子之反革命活动，迅速恢复发展生产，建设新北平，北平市总工会曾于六月初号召本市工人参加纠察、公安工作；至六月三十日止，参加纠察总队者达两千二百五十人，参加公安队者四百八十七人，新的纠察队员和公安队员已分别集中入队学习。六月初市总工会发出的这一号召，曾在铁路、矿山、各大工厂，以及各行各业广大工人中间得到响亮的回答：“参加纠察队，保护新北平！”各公营工厂的行政、支部、工会、青年团都进行了热烈的讨论，市的、各区的以及主要生产单位的审查委员会亦随之成立，保证成份纯洁及年龄体格合乎条件。在运动过程中，特务分子曾造谣破坏，均经各区及工厂工作同志一一揭破，并就目前形势、人民纠察队及公安队员的性质与任务反复向工人进行了解释。解放后工人翻了身，政治觉悟提高了，有保卫胜利果实的要求，纷纷说：“过去，国民党宪兵欺负我们，压迫我们，现在咱们解放了，翻过来咱要管制特务坏蛋，叫他们永远不能翻身！”因之，广大工人参加纠察队极为踊跃。平津路局的丰台、长辛店、西直门、前门等站工人接获市总工会的号召后，大家争相参加，西直门和前门均有多年的老技术工人，不计较待遇高低，不顾家庭拉腿，再三要求参加。以上各站工人经批准入队者一百八十七人。平津被服厂工人，一次报名的有三百多人，第二次报名的有八十多人，一厂副支书杨景深带头率领。因为生产的需要，和其他方面条件的限制，该厂审查合格的有一百四十七人，很多被留下来的工人同志曾再三要求参加。全体工人都非常羡慕已被批准参加的人。清河制呢厂三十多工人报名，合格入队者十一人，工人张承贵，起初家庭不愿让他参加，他向家庭解释：参加纠察队同在工厂一样，能照顾家庭。他报名后对人说：“家庭不成问题，只要厂里领导上批准就行了。”门头沟各矿厂有百多名工人自动报名参加。各工厂在队员出厂时都进行了欢送，新队员入队时，也进行了欢迎，非常隆重，大家情绪非常高。从以上两千一百多新纠察队员的成份来讲，产业工人约占全数的三分之一，手工业、店员、学徒工人约占三分之一，三轮车工人约占三分之一。从文化程度上看，绝大部分为小学程度及粗通文字者。大家学习情绪甚高。入队后，每人即先发了半个月七十五斤薪金米，除了给家庭用外，余下的大家都买成钢笔和笔记本，准备学习时用。这次动员当中，工人表现了对国家认真负责的态度，譬如在报名当中，有的坏分子混入，都被工人自动检举出来。经集中编队后，全体队员已正式开始学习。首先即为继续提高自己的阶级觉悟，从诉苦、比生活中大家的政治认识与阶级觉悟更加提高。
