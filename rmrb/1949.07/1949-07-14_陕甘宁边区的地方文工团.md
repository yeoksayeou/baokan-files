Local Cultural Work Troupes in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region
    Yi Qun, Mo Dong, Manni, Jun Yao, Wu Jian
    The divisional cultural work troupes that have been working in the rural areas of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region for a long time include five groups: Guanzhong, Sanbian, Longdong, Suide, and Yanshu. Except for Yanshu, which was established later, these cultural work troupes have been around for more than ten years. The initial members were cowherds, young recruits from government agencies and military units, and students. Most of them were illiterate, lacked specialized talents, had no musical instruments or costumes, and even had difficulty getting enough to eat. However, under the leadership of the Party and with the nurturing and help of the masses, they gradually overcame these difficulties. When they were first formed, there were not many people. The scripts, costumes, musical instruments, and props, all the way to the directors, were solved with the enthusiastic help of the masses. Even when there were not enough actors or instrumentalists, the masses actively participated, so that the plays to be performed could be successfully staged. Therefore, from the day it was born, it has been closely integrated with the masses. Now the five divisional cultural work troupes have more than four hundred people.

    Dramas are mainly based on local forms such as Qinqiang. Over the years, it has been proven that local operas are most popular with the local masses. At the same time, it must be ancient costume plays, modern plays, and diversified with local opera as the main focus and supplemented by other Yangko dances, etc. Specializing in one genre will not work and will not be able to complete the political tasks. In the past, some units specialized in ancient costume plays. The masses said, "It's not interesting to just sing and not act," especially young people who think "It's not fun to only look at the ancient court and not look at what is happening now." But it won't work to only do modern plays either. The ×× Theater Troupe hated old plays so much that they sold all the costume boxes and specialized in new forms of plays. The masses openly said, "We don't want the ×× Theater Troupe." When performing in × place, the masses requested, "After you finish performing the play, please sing two excerpts from the opera for us!" The so-called "singing opera" refers to ancient costume plays. According to the needs of the masses, each cultural work troupe is now diversified, and the actors have mastered diverse techniques.

    Because the cultural work troupe is closely integrated with the masses, the creation requires more rapid communication of the Party's policies and tasks to the masses. Therefore, close integration of creation with local Party and government work has become one of the characteristics. Today, the Party and government have a resolution, and tomorrow they will collect materials, write scripts, compose songs, draw cartoons, and even require the play to be performed. Indeed, from an artistic point of view, these works are very naive, but they play a significant role at that time and place. At the same time, due to the complexity of political tasks, the selection of themes and the use of forms are also very complex. For example, among the ninety-three works created since the Liberation War (excluding drum lyrics), there are twelve themes and nine forms. Experience tells us that we must be good at grasping this characteristic in order to play a certain role in the current movement.

    There are also many creations in art and music. Art has found a position on shadow plays and has always been a favorable weapon for propaganda. The publication of song collections is frequent, and the musicians of the cultural work troupe spend most of their time on the creation of bands and opera music, which is closely related to drama.

    Old artists are also constantly being reformed or joining our ranks. Some have become Communist Party members or Communist Youth League members. Through the teaching of these artists, business and technology have also improved. Nearly a hundred old artists are advancing on the new road.

    During the war and land reform, the comrades of the cultural work troupe also personally participated in this melting pot, and sometimes even took on combat tasks. Everyone knows that they must go into the heat of the struggle to understand more deeply how the Party's policies and the masses are combined.

    There are now about three hundred new and old plays that can be performed. The feudal and lewd things have been basically eliminated. The cultural work troupe has become an indispensable part of the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. More than seven hundred performances have been performed from 1947 to the present, but the masses are still not satisfied.

    The Yangko activities of the masses are also organized and assisted in many ways, including scripts, directors, and organizing competitions, and the creation of team members. In addition, in order to more easily reach the masses, the cultural work troupe itself often uses small-scale activities, such as shadow plays, drum books (more than thirty drum books created by ourselves), cultural booths, mobile painting exhibitions, propaganda vehicles, and propaganda yokes, which are the easiest to approach the masses. Activities can be carried out on the street, at home, and even on the kang, and the effect is so great that it cannot be ignored in propaganda.

    The education of the Party and the masses over the past ten years has improved us, but the masses are constantly improving. As far as our own skills are concerned, we are far from meeting the needs of the masses. Therefore, further improvement has become an urgent task. However, we ourselves lack the strength to solve this problem and even become distressed. Here, we extend our sincere hands and hope that comrades will help and advise us.

　　陕甘宁边区的地方文工团
    依群·莫东·曼尼·俊耀·吴坚
    长期工作在陕甘宁农村的分区文工团，计有关中、三边、陇东、绥德、延属等五个团体；这些文工团除延属成立较迟外，都有十多年的历史了；最初的成员，都是放牛娃娃或机关部队的小鬼和学生，绝大部分不识字，缺乏专门人材，没有乐器和服装，甚至连吃饭都很困难，然而在党的领导和群众的抚育帮助下逐渐克服了，开始组成时人数不多，剧本、服装、乐器、道具一直到导演，都是在群众的热诚帮助下解决的，甚至演员或文武场不够时，群众们也积极参加，使要演的戏可以顺利演出，所以从它产生的那一天起，便和群众密切结合起来了，现在五个分区文工团，共有四百多人。
    戏剧都是以秦腔等地方形式为主，多年来证明地方戏最为当地群众欢迎；同时又必须是古装戏，时装戏，以地方戏为主配合其他秧歌剧等多样化，专搞一门行不通，也完不成政治上的任务；过去有个别单位专演古装戏，群众说：“光唱不演没意思”，尤其青年们认为“光看古朝不看眼前不畅快”；但单搞时装戏也不成，××剧团对旧戏深恶痛绝，把衣箱全部卖掉，专演新形式戏，群众公开提出“不要××剧团”，在×地出演时群众要求“你们演罢戏了，再给我们唱两折大戏吧！”所谓“唱大戏”就是指古装戏而言，根据群众的需要，现在每个文工团都是多样化的，同时演员也都掌握着多样的技术。
    由于文工团和群众密切的结合着，所以创作上就要求更迅速地把党的政策和任务传达给群众，因此创作和各地党政工作密切结合便成为特点之一；今天党政有了决议，明天便要搜集材料，写剧本，编歌子，画漫画，甚至要求把戏也要演出来，的确，从艺术观点上看，这种作品非常幼稚，但它在当时当地所起的作用是很大的；同时由于政治任务的复杂，使主题的选择，形式的利用，也非常复杂。如解放战争以来创作的九十三（未包括鼓词）作品中，就有十二种主题九种形式；经验告诉我们，必须善于掌握这种特点，才能对当前的运动起一定作用。
    美术和音乐方面也有不少创作，美术在洋片上找到了阵地，也一直是宣传的有利武器。歌集的印发是经常的，同时文工团的音乐工作者，大部分时间都用在乐队和剧曲的创作上，和戏剧密切连系着。
    对于旧艺人也不断改造，或加入自己的队伍。有的已经成为共产党员或青年团员，经过这些艺人的传授，业务技术也提高了一步。近百的旧艺人，正在新的道路上前进。
    战争和土改中，文工团的同志们，也亲身参加了这一熔炉，有时甚至担任战斗任务。大家都知道必须到火热的斗争中去，才会更深刻了解党的政策和群众如何结合着。
    现在能演的新旧戏共有三百个左右，封建淫荡的东西基本上消灭了，文工团已成为工农兵生活中不可缺少的东西，四七年到现在演出七百场以上，但群众还不满足。
    对群众的秧歌活动也多方组织与帮助，剧本，导演，并且组织比赛，和队员们的创作。此外文工团本身为了更容易深入群众，经常利用小形式的活动，如洋片、鼓书（自己创作鼓书三十多个）文化棚、流动画展、宣传车、宣传担等，最易接近群众，街上家里甚至炕上都可以活动，效果之大是宣传上不可忽视的。
    十余年来党和群众的教育提高了我们，但群众不断在进步，就我们自己的本领来说，远不能满足群众的需要，所以进一步提高，便成了迫切的任务，然而我们自己，对于这个问题的解决缺乏力量，甚至成为苦恼，在这里伸出诚恳的双手，希望同志们帮助指教。
