The Workers' Daily published an editorial entitled "Stop the Sinister Arms Program," stating: "According to the official view in Washington, nothing is 'more terrible for business' than a century of peace. Therefore, Truman is now actively manufacturing the war panic that was repelled by the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. He is using the method of 'artificially scaring' America—a method that has been exposed as an integral part of the government's intimidation of public opinion." The Workers' Daily pointed out that Truman based his appeal on the slander that Soviet policy is an "aggressive policy," but, "since there is no evidence of any Soviet aggression anywhere in the world, Truman fabricated the theory of 'internal aggression,' referring to the progress of the working-class socialist movement in any country." The Workers' Daily declared that the armed "aid" program is, in fact, a "sinister plan" aimed at preventing further consolidation of the peace achievements at the Paris Conference, undermining the United Nations, and piling up flammable gunpowder as high as a mountain so that Wall Street trusts can ignite it at any time when they feel that doing so can save them from the rapidly deepening economic crisis and trigger World War III. However, people all over the world are beginning to realize the absurdity of the myth of "Soviet aggression," and no one abroad believes it anymore. They see the Soviet Union proposing peace suggestions, withdrawing all troops from Germany, banning atomic warfare, and conducting large-scale peacetime trade. They ask: Why doesn't Washington accept these suggestions? Recently, the Quaker declaration strongly urged peace between the United States and the Soviet Union, condemning Truman's fallacy that "war is inevitable." Such statements show the direction in which the tide is flowing. In conclusion, the Workers' Daily strongly urged the people, the press, and Congress to reject Truman's proposals and abandon the entire "Cold War policy" that betrays the interests of the American people. The newspaper declared, "Peace can and must win victory."
Washington news reports show that the movement in Congress to at least temporarily abandon Truman's proposals and replace them with a smaller, temporary plan is growing. The Washington correspondent of the New York Sun reported that senators' opinions are rapidly and clearly opposed to Truman's proposals. He said that Truman's painstaking and costly proposals have met with almost universal disapproval in Congress. Vandenberg told the newspaper reporter that he had notified the State Department that Truman's plan as it currently stands would not be approved by Congress. However, he said he would not make any suggestions himself. The Wall Street Journal fiercely criticized Truman's proposal for excessive power. The newspaper said that Truman is asking Congress to abandon its responsibility in foreign affairs and give him full power to use American military and economic power anytime, anywhere. He is asking the United States not only to give military support to Western European countries, but also to give the same support to any country, anywhere, entirely at his own discretion.

　　和平一定赢得胜利
    工人日报以“制止罪恶的军备计划”为题发表社论称：“依照华盛顿官方的见解，再没有任何东西比和平世纪‘对于企业更为可怕’的了。因此，杜鲁门现在正积极制造为巴黎外长会议所击退的战争惊慌。他正使用‘人工地惊吓’美国的手段——这种手段曾经被揭露过是政府恫吓舆论的一个组成部分。”工人日报指出，杜鲁门把他的呼吁建立在所谓苏联政策是“侵略政策”这个谰言之上，但是，“由于世界上任何地方都没有任何苏联侵略的一点证据，于是，杜鲁门就制造了‘国内侵略’的理论，这里，他所指的就是任何国家中工人阶级社会主义运动的进展”。工人日报宣称，武装“援助”计划，实际上是“罪恶计划”，其目的是用以阻止进一步巩固巴黎会议上的和平成就，破坏联合国，并把易燃的火药堆积得象山一样高，以备华尔街的托辣斯在觉得这样可以挽救他们脱离迅速加深的经济危机的时候，随时将火药点燃，爆发为第三次大战。但是，全世界人民开始认识到“苏联侵略”这种神话的荒诞无稽，国外没有什么人再相信它了。他们看见苏联提出和平建议，自德国撤出一切军队，禁止原子战争及进行大规模和平时期的贸易等。他们问道：华盛顿何以不接受这些建议呢？最近，教友派宣言力促美苏和平，斥责杜鲁门的“战争不可避免”的谬论。这类的声明显示了潮流所趋的方向。工人日报在结语中力促人民、报界和国会拒绝杜鲁门的建议，并且抛弃背叛美国人民利益的整个“冷战政策”。该报宣称，“和平能够而且一定要赢得胜利。”
    华盛顿的新闻报道显示，国会方面要求至少是暂时地放弃杜鲁门的建议而代之以小规模的暂时计划的运动在日益增长中。纽约太阳报华盛顿记者报道称：参议员的意见迅速明确地反对杜鲁门的建议。他说，杜鲁门煞费心机制造而所费不赀的建议，在国会中的反应几乎是普遍的不赞成。范登堡告该报记者称：他已经通知国务院说，象目前这样的杜鲁门计划，是得不到国会批准的。但是，他说他自己不会提出任何建议。华尔街日报猛烈抨击杜鲁门要求过分权力的建议。该报称：杜鲁门要求国会放弃它在外交上的责任，而给他以随时随地使用美国军事与经济力量的全权。他要求美国不仅给西欧国家以军事支持，而且完全随他自己的意思就可以给任何地方任何国家以同样的支持。
