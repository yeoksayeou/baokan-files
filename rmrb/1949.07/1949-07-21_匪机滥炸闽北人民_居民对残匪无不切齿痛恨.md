　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Fujian Front, 20th: Kuomintang bandit planes have been indiscriminately bombing newly liberated cities in northern Fujian such as Nanping, Gutian, Jianyang, and Jian'ou for several days, causing significant losses to the lives and property of the local people. On July 8th, bandit planes dropped nine incendiary bombs on Jianyang, a city with a population of less than 20,000. At that time, the weather was dry and the wind was strong, causing a city-wide fire. Although the democratic government made every effort to lead the rescue, about two-thirds of the city's houses were burned down. Countless people witnessed the destruction of all their houses and property, and their cries shook the sky. They all utterly detested the crimes of the Kuomintang remnant bandits. Prior to this, Jian'ou, Gutian, Nanping, and Shaxian in northern Fujian had also been continuously bombed by bandit planes. On June 28th and 29th, more than ten citizens were killed in Jian'ou. Nanping County was bombed twice on July 6th, killing and injuring twelve citizens. Liufang Middle School in the county was also hit, killing and injuring two teachers and one student.

    【新华社闽北前线二十日电】国民党匪机连日滥肆轰炸闽北南平、古田、建阳、建瓯等新解放城市，造成该地人民生命财产的重大损失。七月八日，匪机对不上两万人口的建阳城区，投下九枚燃烧弹，当时天干风急，引起全城大火，虽经民主政府全力领导抢救，全城民房被烧毁约三分之二。无数人民目睹自己房屋财产全部被毁，哭声震天，对国民党残余匪帮的罪行，无不切齿痛恨。在此以前，闽北的建瓯、古田、南平、沙县亦均连续遭匪机轰炸。六月二十八、二十九两日，建瓯城被炸死市民十余人。南平县七月六日两次遭炸，死伤市民十二人，该县流芳中学亦被炸中，死伤教员二名，学生一名。
