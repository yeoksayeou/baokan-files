　　Pingxi Special District, Chahar Province

  　Completely Eliminate Wasteland
    Urgently Rescue from Hail Disaster
    ▲In the past, Pingxi Special District had a shortage of labor in the mountainous areas. After the land reform, farmers were allotted good land but did not cultivate the poor land; the border areas were devastated by the enemy. The entire district had more than 14,000 mu of wasteland. This year, all of North China was liberated, labor service was reduced, and the land reform in the old liberated areas was completed. Land was adjusted in the new liberated areas, and the farmers were highly motivated to produce. Leaders at all levels grasped the reduction of wasteland from the beginning of spring plowing. By the end of last month, after the thorough rain, except for a small amount of thin sandy land unsuitable for cultivation, which was left for afforestation in the rainy season, all the wasteland had been eliminated. It is estimated that this year, production can be increased by more than 8,600 shi. (Pingxi District Committee Office)

    ▲Laishui, Zhuozhou, Liangxiang, Fangshan and other places in Pingxi Special District suffered a severe hail disaster on the afternoon of July 1st, resulting in significant losses. The District Committee immediately instructed the affected counties to take emergency measures: 1. Console the masses in the disaster areas, explain the causes of hail, and expose the various rumors of the reactionaries. 2. Investigate the disaster situation, replant where needed, and supplement planting where needed, without missing the sowing time. 3. Immediately mobilize the masses to weed and loosen the soil after the weather clears, so that the crops can grow, and dispatch three working groups to the disaster areas to assist in the above work.

　　察省平西专区
  　全部消灭荒地
    紧急抢救雹灾
    ▲平西专区过去因山地劳力缺乏，土改后农民分得好地不种坏地；边沿区敌人摧残破坏，全区共有荒地一万四千余亩。今年华北全境解放，勤务减轻，老区土改结束。新区进行了土改调剂了土地，农民生产情绪很高。各级领导在春耕开始即抓紧减荒，到上月底落透雨后，除少数不宜耕种的薄砂地留待雨季造林外，荒地已全部消灭，估计今年可增产八千六百多石。　　　　（平西地委办公室）
    ▲平西专区涞涿良乡房山等地，七月一日下午遭受严重雹灾，损失甚大。地委立即指示受灾各县采取紧急措施：一、慰问受灾区群众，解释下雹原因，揭破反动分子的各种谣言。二，调查灾情，需改种者改种，需补种者补种，不要错过播种时间。三、天晴后立即发动群众锄苗松土，以便庄稼生长，并派出三个工作组到灾区协助进行上述工作。
