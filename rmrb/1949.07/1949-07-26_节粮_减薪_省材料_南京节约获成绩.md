　　Conserving Food, Reducing Salaries, Saving Materials
  　Nanjing Achieves Results in Economy Drive
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The economy drive launched by various government departments, factories, and schools in Nanjing has achieved initial success. Many responsible cadres in the Military Control Commission have voluntarily proposed switching to communal dining. All staff members of a certain district people's government in the city have also decided to save one liang (approximately 50 grams) of food per person per day until the liberation of all of China. All government departments have inspected and criticized the phenomenon of wasting water, electricity, and office supplies, and have formulated various methods for saving. Most importantly, in order to reduce national expenditures and effectively utilize the roles of cadres, many government departments have implemented streamlining of non-essential personnel. For example, the Cooperative Headquarters, which originally had 49 cadres, has now been streamlined to 38; the Second Branch of the Trade General Company has been streamlined from more than 80 people to more than 50. The extracted cadres have taken on new jobs. In schools, after implementing economy measures, Central University's electricity consumption has been reduced by 20% to 40% compared to the past. The National Compilation and Translation Bureau has also reported and handed over to the public the gasoline, white sugar, timber, etc., allocated by the former puppet government. Factories in Nanjing have generally launched a campaign to save materials. Tian Guohui, Zhang Yuanjun, and over two hundred other employees of the Telecommunications Bureau have launched a campaign to reduce salaries by 20%. Workers in a certain private factory also voluntarily saved machine oil. The preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions issued a call to workers and brothers in various factories on the 22nd to cherish equipment, save raw materials, implement scientific management, improve technology, and improve production efficiency; and requested workers and brothers to use their brains, think of more ways, and use local products instead of imported goods.

　　节粮　减薪　省材料
  　南京节约获成绩
    【新华社南京二十五日电】南京各机关、工厂、学校展开的节约运动已获初步成绩。军管会不少负责干部都自动提出改吃大灶。该市某区人民政府全体工作人员，并决定直到解放全中国为止，每人每日按规定节约食粮一两。所有机关都检查和批评浪费水、电、办公用具的现象，订定了各种节约的办法。而最重要的则为为了减少国家开支，和有效地发挥干部作用，许多机关实行了对非必要人员的精简。如合作总社原有干部四十九人，现已精简为三十八人；贸易总公司第二分公司由八十余人精简为五十余人。抽出来的干部已担负新的工作。学校方面，中央大学在实行节约后，用电量已较过去减少了百分之二十到四十。国立编译馆并将前伪政府所配给的汽油、白糖、木材等呈报缴公。南京各工厂则普遍展开了节省材料的运动。电信局职工田国辉、章元浚等二百余人掀起了减薪百分之二十的运动。私营某厂工人也自动节约机油。市总工会筹委会于二十二日向各工厂职工兄弟号召爱护器材，节省原料，实行科学管理，改进技术，提高生产效能；并要求职工兄弟转动脑筋，多想办法，用土产代替舶来品。
