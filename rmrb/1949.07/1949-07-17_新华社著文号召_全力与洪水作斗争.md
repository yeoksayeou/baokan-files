Xinhua News Agency article calls for all-out struggle against floods:

[Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 16th] Short commentary: "All-Out Struggle Against Floods," the text is as follows:

Recently, due to continuous rain in many parts of the country, the water levels of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers have risen sharply, triggering emergency alerts. The situation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River is particularly severe, unprecedented since 1931, and some sections have already breached, causing disasters. In Anhui, areas such as Wuhu, Wangjiang, and Tongling, in northern Jiangsu, areas such as Taizhou, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, and Dongtai, and in southern Jiangsu, areas along Taihu Lake such as Wuxi and Wuxian have been flooded. According to the situation on the 8th, the water level in the middle reaches of the Yellow River was two inches higher than the highest water level last year, and water has overflowed the banks in areas around Zhongmu and Yunbei. The old Yellow River has breached in Xuzhou. In addition, the Gan River basin in Jiangxi and the central plains of Hebei have also experienced flooding. The East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Party and government at all levels in the areas along the rivers and those affected by the disaster have issued urgent instructions to mobilize staff and the broad masses of people to rush to reinforce dikes, prevent floods, provide disaster relief, and manage water; nearby People's Liberation Army troops are also bravely participating to assist in the rescue efforts.

The reason why the floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the middle reaches of the Yellow River are particularly severe this year is due not only to natural causes such as excessive rainfall in summer but also to the heinous rule and insane destruction of the Kuomintang bandit gang. Most of these areas are newly liberated areas. In the past, under the long-term reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, dikes were in disrepair for many years, and flood control organizations and equipment were neglected. In addition, the Kuomintang bandit army arbitrarily bombed and destroyed dikes and dug trenches, making the already dilapidated dikes even more damaged. Therefore, when floods broke out, it was difficult to control them. Not only that, but after the recent incidents in various places, the Kuomintang bandit gang sent additional aircraft to bomb and strafe along the rivers, and also incited special agents and bandits to step up sabotage activities, harm people engaged in rescue work, and obstruct emergency rescue projects. Their intention is to turn the newly liberated areas into a vast swamp and put hundreds of millions of people to death. This inhuman and monstrous crime of the Kuomintang bandit gang has aroused the extreme indignation of the people throughout the country and will surely be severely punished.

At present, the floods are threatening the survival of countless people, and disaster relief and water management have become the most urgent demands of the people in the areas along the rivers and those affected by the disaster. It is also a severe test for the local Communist Party and the People's Government. If we fail to grasp this major task related to the life and death of the people, fully mobilize the masses, and fight against the floods to alleviate or reduce the disaster, we will disappoint the people, make them feel that we are incompetent, and inevitably become separated from the masses. On the other hand, only by relying on the broad masses, overcoming their passive emotions of resignation to fate and waiting for government relief, and mobilizing and organizing the masses to jointly fight the floods, prevent floods and protect dikes, drain floods, produce for self-salvation, and help each other can we overcome the disaster. Therefore, the local Party and government organs in the areas along the rivers and those affected by the disaster must regard mobilizing the masses for disaster relief and water management as an overriding urgent task. Party cadres and government staff should promote the spirit of sharing life and death and weal and woe with the people, without fear of hardship or fatigue, lead the masses to protect the dikes, organize the masses for self-salvation and mutual assistance, and demonstrate their sense of responsibility for protecting the people and their tenacity in fighting the disaster in action. At the same time, in mobilizing the masses for disaster relief and water management, implement the policy of reasonable burden, adhering to the principle of those with money contributing money and those with labor contributing labor. On the one hand, mobilize the working masses to go all out to rescue the dangerous areas; on the other hand, mobilize landlords and rich peasants to contribute more grain and materials to achieve common prosperity. In this way, in terms of policy and practical actions, the broad masses will truly further realize that the Communist Party and the People's Government are concerned about the interests of the people everywhere and are the people's own party and government, which is fundamentally different from the Kuomintang and its reactionary bureaucratic government, which only knows how to exploit and oppress the people and does not care about the people's suffering at all. In order to establish broad and close ties with the people in the newly liberated areas through this struggle, gain the trust of the masses, take root in the masses, and lay a good foundation for all future work.

Based on reports from various places, the following issues should be noted in this struggle against the floods: (1) Unified leadership and division of responsibilities. The areas affected by the disaster and threatened by the floods this time are very wide, and the upstream and downstream areas are closely related. A breach in one section can flood several counties at a minimum and affect the overall situation at a maximum. Therefore, it is necessary to establish unified command and appropriately unify the deployment of manpower and materials within the possible scope so as to use the forces in a planned way and focus on rescuing the most critical areas. However, each region and section should also be responsible for its own tasks, ensuring the dikes under a certain water level and preventing breaches from causing disasters. (2) Combining science and technology with the experience and labor of the masses. Today, we have received some scientific and water conservancy agencies, and many scientists and technicians are participating in the cause of serving the people, which is a favorable condition that did not exist in the past. We must make full use of this favorable condition, accurately measure the weather and water levels, inspect the dikes along the rivers, and guide the masses in their protective work. In dangerous areas, water conservancy experts, technicians, and engineering teams should be dispatched to be responsible for and assist in dike protection and emergency repairs. (3) Preventing sabotage by special agents and bandits. In the project of repairing dikes and embankments in Anqing and Wuhu in Anhui, north and south of the Yangtze River, sabotage activities by special agents have been discovered. They spread rumors, spread pessimistic sentiments, incited the workers to be passive and slack off, sabotaged the policy of reasonable burden, and even sabotaged the river dikes and carried out armed harassment. We must wage a resolute struggle against special agents and bandits, expose their evil deeds and conspiracies in front of the masses, so that they cannot hide, and quickly eliminate the activities of armed bandits and special agents, so that the mass disaster relief and water management movement can be carried out. (4) In the areas that have been affected by the disaster, in addition to providing emergency relief, we should mainly organize production for self-salvation (such as organizing fishing, planting miscellaneous grains in mountainous areas, etc.), mutual assistance, and mutual relief. If necessary, a certain amount of loans can be issued to help the disaster victims produce, or use the method of work-for-relief to solve the difficulties of the disaster victims. Because the disaster area this year is so wide, relying solely on the government to release food for relief is limited and cannot fundamentally solve the problem. There has been a lot of experience in disaster relief work in North China and East China in the past.

Fighting against the floods that are rare in previous years is a very arduous task, and various places, especially the newly liberated areas, will surely encounter many difficulties. However, we have the experience of overcoming various disasters such as floods, droughts, insect pests, and hail during the Anti-Japanese War, and we also have the experience of defeating the Kuomintang bandit gang's attempt to flood the liberated areas by diverting the Yellow River not long ago. As long as we serve the people wholeheartedly, rely closely on the masses, and make full use of the current favorable conditions and past useful experiences, and devote ourselves to this struggle with all our strength, we will surely be able to overcome the current floods and reduce the harm of this disaster.

    新华社著文号召
    全力与洪水作斗争
    【新华社北平十六日电】短评：“全力与洪水作斗争”，文如下：
    最近全国许多地方由于霪雨连绵，长江、黄河水位暴涨，纷纷告急。长江中下游情势尤为严重，为一九三一年以来所未有，若干地段业已溃决成灾。安徽的芜湖、望江、铜陵等地，苏北的泰州、扬州、高邮、东台等地及苏南太湖沿岸的无锡、吴县等地已有不少地区被淹。黄河中游水位，据八日情况，较去年最高水位高出二寸，中牟、郓北一带，水已漫滩。徐州市旧黄河已决口。此外，江西的赣江流域和河北中部平原，亦均发生水灾。中共中央华东局与沿江沿河和被灾地区的各级党和政府，已发出紧急指示，动员工作人员和广大人民抢险防堤，救灾治水；附近人民解放军驻军亦奋勇参加，协助抢救。
    今年长江中下游和黄河中游地区的水灾所以特别严重，除了入夏雨水过多的自然原因而外，更由于国民党匪帮的罪恶统治和疯狂破坏造成。这些地区，极大部分都是新解放区，过去在国民党长期反动统治下，堤防年久失修，防汛组织和设备弛废；加以国民党匪军任意炸毁堤防，挖掘战壕，使原已颓败的堤岸更加残破不堪，因而洪水暴发，即难收拾。不仅如此，最近各地险象发生后，国民党匪帮又加派飞机在沿江沿河轰炸扫射，并策动特务土匪加紧破坏活动，残害抢险人民，阻挠急救工程，窥其用心，直欲使新解放地区尽成泽国，置亿万生灵于死地。国民党匪帮这种绝灭人性的滔天罪行，激起全国人民的切齿痛愤，必将受到严厉的惩罚。
    目前洪水已经威胁着无数万人民的生存，救灾治水已成为沿江沿河和被灾地区人民的最急迫要求，也是对于当地共产党和人民政府的严重考验。如果我们不能抓紧这一关系人民生死存亡的重大任务，全力动员群众，与洪水作斗争，解脱或减轻灾祸，我们就将使人民失望，感到我们无能，而势必脱离人民群众。而另一方面，又只有依靠广大群众，克服他们听天由命和等待政府救济的消极情绪和侥幸心理，动员和组织群众，共同起来与水灾作战，防汛护堤，排泄洪水，生产自救，互助互济，才能战胜灾害。因此，沿江沿河和被灾地区的地方党政机关，必须把动员群众救灾治水当作压倒一切的紧急任务。党的干部和政府工作人员，应该发扬与人民同生死、共患难的精神，不辞艰辛，不怕疲劳，率领群众上堤防护，组织群众自救互济，在行动中表现出自己爱护人民的责任心和与灾祸搏战的顽强性。同时，在发动群众救灾治水中，贯彻合理负担政策，本有钱出钱、有力出力的原则，一方面动员劳动群众全力抢险；另方面动员地主富农多出粮食材料，做到同舟共济。这样，在政策上和实际行动中，使广大群众真正进一步认识到共产党和人民政府处处关心人民利益，是人民自己的政党和政府，与国民党及其反动官僚政府，只知剥削压迫人民，毫不过问人民疾苦，有着本质上的不同。以便经过这一斗争，与新解放区人民建立广泛的亲密的联系，取得群众的信任，在人民群众中生根，为今后的一切工作打下良好的基础。
    综合各地的报道，这次在与水灾作斗争中，应该注意如下几个问题：（一）统一领导，分区负责。这次被灾和受水灾威胁的地区很广，而且上下游息息相关，一段决口，小则泛滥数县，大则影响全局，故必须建立统一的指挥，在可能范围内适当地统一调度人力物力，以便有计划地把力量重点使用，突击抢救最危急地带。但各区各段又应分工负责，在一定水位下确保堤防，不使溃决成灾。（二）科学技术与群众的经验和劳力相结合。今天我们已经接收了一些科学和水利机关，并有不少科学家和技师参加为人民服务的事业，这是过去所没有的有利条件。必须充分利用这一有利条件，准确地测量天候水位，考察沿江沿河堤防，指导群众进行防护工作。而在险要之处，得派遣水利专家、技师和工程队，实地负责和协助护堤抢修。（三）防止特务匪徒的破坏。在长江南北安徽的安庆、芜湖等地抢修堤圩工程中，都已发现特务的破坏活动。他们造谣惑众，散布悲观情绪，煽动民工消极怠工，破坏合理负担政策，甚至破坏河堤进行武装骚扰。必须与特务匪徒展开坚决的斗争，在群众面前揭发他们的罪恶事迹和阴谋，使之无法潜形慝迹，并迅速扑灭武装匪特的活动，群众性的救灾治水运动才能开展起来。（四）在已经被灾地区，除了进行急赈以外，主要地应组织生产自救（例如组织捕鱼，到山地种杂粮等），互助互济，必要时可发放一定数额的贷款扶助灾民生产，或用以工代赈办法解决灾民的困难。因为今年灾区如此宽广，要单靠政府放粮救济，力量有限，决不能根本解决问题。这在过去华北、华东的救灾工作中已有不少经验。
    与历年罕有的洪水作斗争，是一件十分艰巨的任务，各地尤其是新解放地区一定会遭遇许多困难。但我们有在敌后抗战期间战胜水旱虫雹各种灾害的经验，亦有不久以前打败国民党匪帮对黄河合龙放水企图水淹解放区的经验，只要我们全心全意为人民服务，紧紧地依靠群众，充分利用目前的有利条件和过去的有用经验，以全力投入这个斗争，一定可以战胜当前的水灾，缩小这一灾祸的为害程度。
