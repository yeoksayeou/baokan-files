　　Taiyuan Dispatch: In the Taiyuan District's Third Commissioner's Office's state-owned trading departments, the practice of buying grain and cotton from private merchants without discrimination, and blindly supporting private cotton weaving industries, has led to the serious consequence of aiding private merchant speculation. The Pingyao Trading Company (hereinafter referred to as Fenghua Mao Store) feared trouble, avoided weighing, and offered high prices, resulting in 400,000 jin of grain frequently being stored with private merchants. Among these, many speculators used IOUs to sell grain to the trading company on paper, fraudulently obtaining huge sums of state funds and engaging in destructive activities of buying and selling short. From March to June, the private Tongyi Warehouse in Pingyao sold 100,000 jin of cotton to Fenghua Mao Store on paper. After receiving the money, the warehouse took the opportunity to resell it for profit, earning over one million yuan in a single transaction. Some private merchants often purchased grain from rural areas at low prices but failed to deliver the grain according to the original standards when delivering. In establishing contracts with private cotton weaving factories to provide yarn support, there was a lack of investigation and research, resulting in extreme blindness. The Yuci Trading Branch once lent yarn sufficient to weave 35 bolts of foreign cloth to the private Tongxing Factory, which was then used as capital for speculation. As a result, it failed, failed to deliver cloth on time, the factory shut down, and the workers lost their jobs. Since April, Fenghua Mao has generally signed contracts with private factories in Pingyao to exchange yarn for cloth, frequently lending each machine eight bundles of base yarn (each bundle weighing 7.5 jin). By June, a total of 2,440 bundles of yarn had been lent; however, due to a lack of focus in distribution and no investigation, it not only failed to drive private capital, but many capitalists instead diverted capital for commercial speculation. This both weakened the leading role of the state-owned economy and fueled rising prices. The main reason for the above serious errors is that trade workers do not have a clear understanding of the Party's urban policy. When completing supply tasks, there is a purely task-oriented view, blindly relying on private merchants, while the public stores lack organization and leadership and cannot play a leading role in the market.

　　平遥等县贸易工作右倾
  　助长私商投机国家人民受害
    【太原电】太原区三专署区国营贸易部门中，空买私商粮棉，盲目扶植私营棉织业，致造成助长私商投机倒把的严重恶果，平遥贸易公司（下称丰华茂商店）怕麻烦、脱秤、出脚价，经常有粮四十万斤存放私商处。其中，许多投机商人以打存条向贸易公司空卖粮食，骗取国家巨款，大作买空卖空的破坏活动。平遥私营同义货栈从三月到六月先后空卖给丰华茂商店棉花十万斤，该货栈取款后乘机倒贩，一次即获利一百万元以上。有些私商往往向乡村低价购粮，交粮时却又不按原订标准交粮。在与私营棉织工厂订立合同贷纱扶植上，缺乏调查研究，盲目性极大，榆次贸易分公司曾以可织三十五匹洋布的纱贷给私人同兴工厂，却被充作投机倒贩资本，结果失败，未能按期交布，工厂停顿，工人失业。丰华茂自四月份起，普遍与平遥各私营工厂订立合同以纱换布，每台机经常贷给底纱八块（每块七斤半），迄六月止，共贷二千四百四十块纱；但因发放没重点，不调查，不仅未起了带动私资的作用，许多资方反而誊出资本进行商业投机，这样既削弱了国营经济的领导作用，又助长了物价上涨。造成以上严重错误的原因，主要是贸易工作人员对党的城市政策认识不明确，在完成供应任务时，存在有单纯任务观点，盲目的依靠私商，而对公营商店则缺乏组织与领导，不能在市场上起领导作用。
