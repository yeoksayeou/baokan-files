Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd—Warsaw News: The amount and scope of Poland's foreign trade are expanding daily. In the two years from 1946 to 1948, the trade volume quadrupled. Poland has now established fixed trade relations with thirty-five countries, including twenty-three countries that have signed bilateral agreements. The most important aspect of Poland's foreign trade is its exchanges with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Last year, Poland's trade with these countries accounted for 46 percent of its total foreign trade. In contrast to the first post-war year, Poland's foreign trade is no longer limited to the import of consumer goods and the export of coal; Poland now exports and imports a wide variety of goods, with the emphasis shifting to the import of capital goods (referring to machinery and other production goods) and the export of industrial products. In the first half of this year, Poland's coal exports reached 14,344,400 tons. Coking coal exports reached 943,000 tons, while in the same period last year, coal and coking coal exports totaled only 11,361,000 tons. Currently, Polish glassware is exported to seventeen countries, and cement to thirteen countries. In the first five months of this year, the total export value of cement, glassware, and pottery reached US$6.8 million.

　　波兰对外贸易
  　两年中贸易额增加四倍
  　与三十五国有固定关系
    【新华社北平二十二日电】华沙讯，波兰对外贸易的数额与范围日益扩大。从一九四六年至一九四八年的两年中，贸易额增加了四倍。波兰现与三十五国包括二十三个签订了双边协定的国家建立了固定的贸易关系。波兰对外贸易中最主要的是与苏联及人民民主国家的往来。去年，波兰与这些国家的贸易，占全部对外贸易的百分之四十六。与战后第一年相反，波兰的对外贸易已不限于消费品的输入和煤炭的输出；波兰现在输出和输入的物品种类繁多，其着重点正转向资本货物（指机器之类生产用货物）的输入与工业品的输出。今年上半年，波兰煤的输出达一千四百三十四万四千吨。焦煤输出达九十四万三千吨，而在去年同一时间内，煤和焦煤的输出只有一千一百三十六万一千吨。现在，波兰的玻璃器皿向十七个国家出口，水泥向十三个国家出口。本年头五个月中，水泥、玻璃器皿和陶器的出口总值计达六百八十万美元。
