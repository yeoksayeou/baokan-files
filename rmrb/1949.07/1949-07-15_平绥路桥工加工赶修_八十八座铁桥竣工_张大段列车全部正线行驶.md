　　PingSui Railway Bridge Workers Expedite Repairs
    Eighty-Eight Iron Bridges Completed
  　Zhang-Da Section Trains Now Running on Main Line
    [Chahar News] The restoration project of eighty-eight iron bridges between Xiwangbao and Datong on the PingSui Railway, undertaken by the bridge work team, was completed ten days ahead of schedule at the end of last month thanks to the team's efforts. The project was undertaken by the Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau's bridge work team, which began surveying and investigating on April 1st, and officially started construction on April 14th. As of the end of June, except for three small bridges where concrete slab beams had not yet arrived and were temporarily replaced with扣钢轨 [I'm not familiar with this railway term, it may mean inverted rails or rails arranged in a special way], all other projects were completed, with actual construction taking seventy-nine days. According to the most economical budget in the past, this project would have required 42,669 workdays, but thanks to the mobilization of the enthusiasm of more than 700 employees, most of them voluntarily extended their working hours and often persisted in working in heavy rain. In addition, the construction used methods such as "temporary support repair" (erecting temporary support beams on the original bridge, allowing traffic to pass above and repairing the bridge below) as much as possible. The actual labor used for the eighty-eight bridges was only 35,974 workdays. From July 1st, trains between Zhangjiakou and Datong have been running on the newly built bridges on the main line. The completion of this huge project not only allows the train speed between Zhang and Da to be initially improved, but also basically prevents the danger of trains stopping due to flash floods during the rainy season.

　　平绥路桥工加工赶修
    八十八座铁桥竣工
  　张大段列车全部正线行驶
    【察哈尔讯】平绥路西湾堡大同间八十八座铁桥的复原工程，在桥工队努力赶修下，已于上月底提前十日竣工。该项工程为张家口铁路分局桥工队所担任，四月一日开始勘测、调查，四月十四日正式开工，截至六月底，除三座小桥因洋灰版梁未运到暂用扣钢轨方法代替外，其他工程全部完竣，实际施工共七十九日。该项工程根据过去最经济的预算亦需工四二、六六九个，但由于发动了七百余职工的积极性，大都自动延长工时，常在大雨中坚持工作，加以施工上尽量使用“托修”（在原桥上架起临时托梁，上面行车，下面修桥）等办法，八十八座桥实用工仅三五、九七四个。从七月一日起，张家口、大同间列车已全部在新修桥梁上之正线行驶。这一巨大工程之完成，不仅使张大间行车速度得以初步提高，且基本上防止了雨季因山洪暴发而停车的危险。
