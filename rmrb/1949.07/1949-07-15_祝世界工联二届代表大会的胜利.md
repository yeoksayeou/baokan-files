　　Congratulations on the Victory of the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress

    The Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress victoriously concluded on the 9th, after ten days of meetings.

    This congress demonstrated the great unity of the international working class, and also reflected the great failure of the schemers who attempted to split the World Federation of Trade Unions and undermine the unity of the world's workers. After the American, British, and Dutch splinter groups withdrew from the World Federation of Trade Unions, they successively instigated trade unions in Norway, Belgium, Denmark, and other countries to withdraw from the World Federation of Trade Unions against the will of the vast majority of their members; and, with the full support of the reactionary authorities in their countries, they carried out various activities to split and undermine the unity of the working class. However, despite all this, the World Federation of Trade Unions has not been weakened as a result, but has instead become stronger. Attending this congress were not only representatives from the central trade union organizations of the 34 countries affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions, but also observers from the central trade union organizations of 14 countries not affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions. In addition, delegations from China, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, Japan, Burma, and six other countries were unable to attend the congress because the reactionary authorities in their countries refused to issue passports or the Italian government refused to issue entry visas, but the delegations from these ten countries unanimously expressed their firm will to unite with the World Federation of Trade Unions. To date, the trade unions affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions in 45 countries have a total membership of over 71,178,000, an increase of 6,780,000 compared with the First Congress in October 1945. This is the best answer to the splitters. Although the delegates attending this congress had different nationalities, religions, and political beliefs, they held a unanimous view on the aims of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and they discussed various issues in a spirit of brotherly harmony and friendship; they expressed unanimous and warm support for the nine-point task proposals for the World Federation of Trade Unions and national trade unions put forward by Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet delegation. All of this shows that the political and ideological unity of the broad masses of working people in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America can no longer be prevented or undermined by any evil forces.

    In the forty-five months since its establishment, the World Federation of Trade Unions has been fighting for world peace and democracy, for the social and economic welfare of the working people, and for the freedom of trade union activities. Therefore, it has in practice become a major force in combating American and British warmongers, and a fighting organization for defending the interests of the working people. At this congress, in light of the current new situation, two important resolutions were adopted – a resolution on the general report of the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and a resolution on the struggle to defend peace, the democratic rights of the people of all countries, and international trade union solidarity. These two resolutions clearly define the future course of action, and solemnly declare that the world's working people will strengthen their unity and struggle even more to defend peace, democracy, trade union rights, and living standards. This will further develop and strengthen the movement to defend world peace and oppose new wars, and will subject the instigators of new wars to more serious resistance and blows.

    Chinese workers warmly celebrate the victory of the congress, and firmly believe that after the conclusion of the congress, under the guidance of the executive bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the ranks of the world working class will be more closely united, and the workers' movement will surely achieve greater development and more glorious victories. Although the Chinese delegation was unable to attend the meeting due to the Italian government's refusal to issue entry visas, no obstruction whatsoever can separate the Chinese working class from the World Federation of Trade Unions. Chinese workers fully support the goals and aims of the World Federation of Trade Unions, warmly welcome the convening of the Asian Trade Union Representative Conference in New China, and resolutely support and implement the resolutions of the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress. Chinese workers will always stand with the World Federation of Trade Unions and with the world working class, contributing their strength to accelerate the success of the world working class's cause of defending peace and striving for democratic happiness.

### 祝世界工联二届代表大会的胜利

　　祝世界工联二届代表大会的胜利
    世界职工联盟第二届代表大会，在开会十天以后，已于九日胜利闭幕。
    这次代表大会表现了国际工人的大团结，同时也反映了分裂世界工联和破坏世界工人团结的阴谋者的大失败。美英荷分裂分子在退出世界工联以后，曾先后策动挪、比、丹等国职工会违反广大会员的意志而退出世界工联；并在本国反动当局的全力支持下，进行了种种分裂和破坏工人阶级团结的活动。但尽管如此，世界工联并未因此而削弱了，却反而更增强了。出席这次代表大会的，不仅有世界工联所属的三十四个国家的职工会中央机构的代表，而且有非工联所属的十四个国家的职工会中央机构的观察员。还有中、印、印尼、蒙古、日、缅等十国的代表团，虽因本国反动当局的拒发护照或意政府拒发入境签证而不能出席大会，但是这十个国家的代表团一致表示了与世界工联团结一致的坚决意志。迄今为止，世界工联所属的四十五个国家的职工会，会员总数已达七千一百七十八万余人，较一九四五年十月第一届代表大会时增加了六百七十八万人。这是对分裂分子的最好回答。出席这次大会的代表，虽有国籍、宗教和政治信仰的不同，但它们对于世界工联的宗旨，却抱有一致的见解，它们对于各项问题的讨论，都以兄弟般的和谐和友爱精神进行；他们对于苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫所提世界工联与各国职工会九项任务的建议，表示一致的热烈拥护。这一切显示：欧、亚、非、拉丁美洲各国广大劳动人民在政治和思想上的团结一致，已经不是任何恶势力所能够阻挡和破坏的了。
    世界工联在它成立的四十五个月中，曾一直为争取世界和平与民主，争取劳动人民的社会经济福利，争取职工会活动的自由而斗争。因此，它实际上已成为打击美英战争贩子的重大力量，成为保卫劳动人民利益的战斗组织。这次大会根据目前的新情势，通过了两个重要的决议——关于世界工联活动总报告的决议，与保卫和平、各国人民的民主权利与国际职工会团结的斗争的决议。这两个决议，明确地规定了未来的行动方针，庄严地宣布了世界劳动人民将更加强为保卫和平、民主、工会权利与生活水平而团结奋斗。这就将使保卫世界和平和反对新战争的运动，更进一步地发展和壮大，使新战争的挑拨者遭遇更严重的阻力和打击。
    中国工人热烈庆祝代表大会的胜利，并深信大会闭幕以后，在世界工联执行局的指导下，世界工人阶级的队伍将更紧密地团结起来，工人阶级的运动一定会获得更广大的发展和更光辉的胜利。中国代表团虽因意政府的拒发入境签证而未能与会，但是，任何阻力都一概不能把中国工人阶级与世界工联分割开来，中国工人全力拥护世界工联的目标和宗旨，热烈欢迎在新中国召开亚洲职工会代表会议，并坚决支持和执行世界工联第二届代表大会的决议。中国工人将永远和世界工联一起，和世界工人阶级一起，贡献自己的力量，以使世界工人阶级保卫和平与争取民主幸福的事业，加速地得到成功。　　　　（新华社北平十四日电）
