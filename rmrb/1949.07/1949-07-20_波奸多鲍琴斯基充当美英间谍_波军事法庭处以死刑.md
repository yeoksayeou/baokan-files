Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th. According to a Polish News Agency report: After twelve days of trial, the Polish Local Military Tribunal sentenced Dobaocinski, a spy who served American and British imperialism, to death on the 12th of this month. The court declared that Dobaocinski violated Poland's national interests and committed treason. The verdict stated: From 1933 to 1939, Dobaocinski was an agent of Nazi Germany's intelligence agency in Poland. From 1945 to 1947, he worked for the interests of American and British imperialists in the British and American occupied zones of England, France, Italy, and Germany, as well as in Poland, especially for the American intelligence agency, and established contact with Polish fascist exile groups, cooperating with them in organizational and political activities. In 1946, upon the order of the American intelligence agency, he returned to Poland and organized a clandestine nationalist Catholic central organization to establish political, economic, and defense intelligence agencies in Poland. Before Dobaocinski returned to Poland, Alexander, an agent of the American intelligence agency, had discussed with him the establishment of a secret radio transceiver station in Poland to maintain contact with foreign countries. Dobaocinski once traveled around Poland, establishing many connections. He had prepared to go to the Bialystok Forest (northeast of Warsaw) to contact the bandits operating there, but he was captured by the Polish security authorities on July 31, 1947.
