The New Urban-Rural Relationship
—Northeast Daily Editorial, July 5th

    In order to implement the Northeast Party's shift from rural to urban areas, we must fully recognize the importance of cities and correctly understand the significance of urban leadership of rural areas.

    More than half a year has passed since the liberation of the entire Northeast and our entry into major industrial cities such as Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi. During this period, many comrades have worked actively and diligently, learning from scratch and overcoming difficulties. They have already gained considerable knowledge, experience, and achievements in how to manage cities and factories. However, there are still many comrades whose actions show that they have some confused notions and chaotic ideas about the importance of cities and the new urban-rural relationship. For example, when a cadre is transferred to manage a factory, some do not see this as increasing their responsibility, but instead consider it a demotion; some are willing to work in the city, but unwilling to manage factories or engage in the workers' movement, preferring to issue orders in the government; some are eager to enter the city, not to engage in arduous economic construction, but attracted by the city's dazzling material pleasures; some manage the city in a rural way, not striving for concentration and unity, but dividing up the complete city; some, although physically in the countryside, believe that rural work is no longer important, relax their duties, and wait to enter the city; some are ecstatic when transferred to the city, but retreat as soon as they see the complex and tense situation in the factory, wanting to return to the countryside; some want to enter the city, but only want to go to Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, etc., and are unwilling to go to northern Manchuria, to the mines, or to the industrial and mining areas that urgently need to be restored and rebuilt from scratch; some are good at making friends with peasants, but not good at making friends with workers; some even view the current people's city with the old viewpoint of urban-rural opposition. The reasons for these confused notions and chaotic ideas stem from individual desires for peaceful enjoyment, status consciousness, etc., and from the erosion of bourgeois ideology, but for most comrades, the main reason does not lie here, but in being in a dispersed rural environment for a long time, retaining serious rural work styles, having an empirical way of thinking, being accustomed to a one-size-fits-all approach, being not good at scientific division of labor, being complacent, conservative, and backward, lacking a sense of fresh things, old revolutionaries encountering new problems, unwilling to humbly become primary school students, unwilling to learn from scratch, and lacking Bolshevik courage in the face of difficulties, not overcoming difficulties from a positive perspective, but escaping difficulties from a negative perspective. Therefore, how to educate and overcome their various confused notions about urban-rural relations in practical actions is a difficult task for our current cadre ideological education.

    新的城乡关系
    ——东北日报七月五日社论
    为了贯彻东北全党由乡村到城市的转变，我们必须充分认识城市的重要性，正确了解城市领导乡村的意义。
    东北全境解放，我们进入沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪等大工业城市，至今已经半年有余了。在此期间内，不少同志积极努力，从头学起，克服困难，对于如何管理城市，如何管理工厂，已经得到不少知识、经验和成绩。但是，还有不少同志在实际行动上表现出他们对城市的重要性和新的城乡关系，还存在着某些糊涂观念和混乱思想。譬如调干部管理一个工厂，有的不视为这将加重自己责任，反而认为把自己降级使用了；有的愿意到城市工作，却不愿去管理工厂，不愿从事工人运动，而要求到政权中去发号施令；有的急切要求进入城市，不是为了从事艰苦的经济建设，而是被城市花花绿绿的物质享受所吸引；有的以农村方式来管理城市，不是尽力求其集中统一，而是把完整的城市分割开来；有的虽身在乡村，但认为乡村工作不再重要，放松职责，等待进城；有的被调到城市，开始兴高采烈，一经看到工厂复杂紧张状况，见难而退，又要再回到乡村去；有的要进城，却只想去沈阳、鞍山、抚顺等地，而不肯到北满，不肯到矿山，更不肯到急需从头恢复和建设的工矿地区；有的善于和农民作朋友，却不善于和工人作朋友；甚至有的还以城乡对立的旧观点来看待现在人民的城市。所以产生这些糊涂观念与混乱思想，有的来自个人打算的和平享乐、地位观念等，有的来自资产阶级思想的侵蚀，但对多数同志来说，主要地不在这里，而是在于长期处在分散的农村环境，保留了严重的农村作风，思想方法是经验主义的，习惯于一揽子方式，不善于科学分工，自满自足，保守落后，对新鲜事物缺乏感觉，老革命碰到新问题，不愿虚心当小学生，不肯从头学起，碰到困难缺乏布尔塞维克的勇气，不从积极方面去克服困难，而是从消极方面去逃避困难。因此从实际行动中如何去教育和克服他们对城乡关系上的各种糊涂观念，是我们当前干部思想教育的一个艰巨任务。          （未完）
