    Zhangjiakou Silver and Money Businesses
    Gradually Switching to Other Industries
    [Chahar News] The Zhangjiakou city silver firms originally had ten firms such as Xinchangyu and Dachuanyu, all of which had one-fifth of the official shares of the puppet Chahar Provincial Bank. Before liberation, in addition to handling deposit and loan business, most of the funds of each firm were used for speculation, hoarding, and manipulating the market, and other illegal operations. For example, Huitong and Yuxin stored large quantities of grain, coal, sugar, cloth, etc. After the liberation of Zhangjiakou, in addition to clearing out the official shares of the puppet provincial bank from each firm, each silver firm was strictly managed in accordance with the "Measures for the Management of Private Silver and Money Businesses" promulgated by the North China People's Government, and they were gradually persuaded to change industries. Currently, those who have changed industries include Yuxin, which has been changed to Rixin Chang Grocery Store, and plans to go to Hankou to rent machinery to manufacture brick tea; Dachuanyu has changed to weaving socks and has gone to Peiping to purchase machinery. The remaining firms have also closed down because they realized that there was no future in speculation, and are now planning to change industries.

    张家口银钱业
    陆续转营他业
    【察哈尔讯】张市银号原有信昌裕、大川裕等十家，都有伪察哈尔省银行五分之一的官股。解放前，除经营存放业务外，各号大部资金都用作投机倒把，囤积居奇操纵市场等非法经营上，如汇通、豫新等都存有大批粮食、煤、糖、布等。张市解放后，除将各号之伪省行官股清出外，对各银号均依照华北人民政府颁布的私人银钱业管理办法施以严格管理，并逐渐劝导其改业。现已改业者计豫新改为日新昌杂货庄，并计划到汉口去赁机器制造砖茶；大川裕改织袜子，已到北平购置机器。其余各号也都因觉悟到进行投机事业毫无前途而歇市，现正计划改业。
