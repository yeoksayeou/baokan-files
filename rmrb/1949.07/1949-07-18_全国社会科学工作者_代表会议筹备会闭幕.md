    Representative Conference Preparatory Committee Closes

    [Ping City News] The Preparatory Committee for the All-China Social Science Workers Representative Conference, formed by the initiators of the conference, held its final day of meetings yesterday (the 17th), with Shen Junru serving as executive chairman. At the meeting, Tao Menghe, who had just arrived from Nanjing, gave a speech stating: Under the old reactionary rule, social science had no opportunity for research and development, but under the current new government, everyone is willing to engage in research in various aspects of social science under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, in order to meet practical needs. The meeting decided that the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee would draft a "Draft Articles of Association for the All-China Social Science Workers Association" and a "Draft Program of Action for Social Science Work" in preparation for the convening of the representative conference. In particular, on the issue of the program of action, everyone spoke extremely enthusiastically, with Chen Jinkun, Wang Zhixiang, Wu Bin, Jian Bozan, Luo Changpei, Fan Hong, Fu Tong, Han Shouxuan, Ai Siqi, He Sijing, and others successively expressing their opinions. The meeting also passed three telegrams (texts to be sent separately) to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, expressing respect, and to the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, expressing congratulations. Finally, after Dong Biwu delivered the closing speech (full text to be sent separately), the meeting was declared closed.

    代表会议筹备会闭幕
    【平市讯】中华全国社会科学工作者代表会议筹备会由该会议发起人会中产生后，于昨（十七）日举行最后一天的集会，由沈钧儒任执行主席。会上，甫从南京赶来的陶孟和发表演说称：在旧的反动统治下，社会科学没有研究和发展的机会，但在现在新的政府下，大家都愿意在马恩列斯和毛泽东思想的指导下，从事社会科学各方面的研究，以配合实际的需要。会议决定由筹备会常务委员会草拟“中华全国社会科学工作者协会简章草案”及“社会科学工作纲领草案”，以准备代表会议之召开。特别在工作纲领问题上，大家发言极为踊跃，陈瑾昆、王之相、吴宾、翦伯赞、罗常培、樊弘、傅铜、韩寿萱、艾思奇、何思敬等均相继发表意见。会中并通过向毛主席、朱总司令暨人民解放军全体指战员致敬与向新政治协商会议筹备会致贺等三电（电文另发）。最后在董必武致闭幕词（全文另发）后，会议宣告结束。
