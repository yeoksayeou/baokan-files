    I. The Rationale for Rainy Season Afforestation

    The greatest difficulty in afforesting barren mountains in North China is the dryness of the soil, the lack of sufficient moisture, and the absence of vegetation cover on the ground, resulting in the majority of rainwater being lost through runoff. Large-scale afforestation cannot rely on artificial irrigation, and thus must utilize the natural precipitation during the rainy season in July and August. According to past statistics, the rainy season in North China occurs roughly during July and August in the Gregorian calendar. Although the rainy season is not characterized by continuous rainfall for the entire month, there are more days with scattered showers. In Beijing alone, the annual precipitation is approximately 500 millimeters, with about 70.4% of that falling in July and August. Rainfall days during these two months account for 33% of the total rainy days in the year. The ideal time for tree transplantation is during the following periods: (1) the dormant period of growth; (2) the period when transpiration is low; (3) the period when air humidity is high and rainfall is abundant; and (4) the period when the soil retains a large amount of moisture after transplantation. In barren mountain areas, rainy season transplantation offers the advantages of the aforementioned conditions (2), (3), and (4). Furthermore, in addition to spring and autumn afforestation, the rainy season can create a third afforestation season in the year. Besides transplanting trees during the rainy season, some tree species can also be sown during this time. In the arid regions of North China, especially in mountainous areas where afforestation is difficult, implementing rainy season afforestation can alleviate the burden of irrigation. For example, the survival rate of transplanted coniferous trees is higher than that of afforestation during the spring and autumn seasons.

    II. Methods and Precautions for Rainy Season Afforestation on Barren Mountains

    1. Before the rainy season, the afforestation site should be prepared, and planting pits should be dug in advance to collect rainwater and allow it to seep into the soil.

    2. On barren mountains with long-term neglect and exposed ground, heavy rainfall can cause significant runoff. In extremely arid areas, it is best to build simple water conservation projects first to reduce runoff and increase infiltration. For steep mountain slopes, create horizontal terraces at appropriate intervals. The width of the terraces should be determined by the size of the seedlings, but approximately two Chinese feet is generally sufficient. The terrace surface should be slightly inclined inward to conserve water and soil, and planting pits should be dug on the terraces. This facilitates water and soil conservation, and greatly increases the survival rate of afforestation.

    3. Land preparation, pit digging, water conservation, and other difficult tasks can be completed in advance. When afforestation takes place after rainfall, the work is relatively simple, involving only seedling lifting, transportation, and planting. However, preparations must be made at all times for the arrival of rainy days, and efforts should be intensified to take advantage of the opportunity. Planting work is best carried out in a torrential rush of rain. Time should be fully utilized, and rainwater should be taken full advantage of.

    4. Seedlings should be lifted during overcast or rainy periods to ensure minimum damage to the roots. If any root parts are damaged, they should be pruned immediately. If the weather is sunny, unused or untransported seedlings should be carefully protected by placing them in a shady area for temporary planting, and the roots should be kept appropriately moist. Special attention should be paid to transporting seedlings. If the journey is long, the roots should be carefully wrapped to prevent them from drying out.

    5. In rainy season afforestation, the soil is moist due to sufficient rainfall before planting. If there are sunny days after planting, continued rainfall is still needed before the soil dries out to ensure that the soil in the forest area remains moist. If there is a prolonged period of sunshine without rain, every effort should be made to implement manual irrigation. Seedlings should be handled from nursery to mountain to final planting in a rainy environment, so that their roots can regain their regenerative capacity. Once this happens, they can adapt even to dry conditions.

    6. In addition, we must pay separate attention to experimental statistics on the determination of the exact timing of the rainy season, the distribution of rainy days, the age of seedlings, the spacing between rows and plants, water conservation methods, and afforestation techniques to obtain accurate results. For example, although we know that July and August in the Gregorian calendar are the rainy season in North China, we still need to compile detailed statistics on climate changes and records in various parts or major strongholds of North China to determine the exact rainy season in each location and provide a reference for afforestation.

    III. Tree Species for Rainy Season Afforestation on Barren Mountains

    The selection of tree species for rainy season afforestation on barren mountains is indeed an important issue. Based on past rainy season afforestation experiments and general experience, coniferous trees are the best, such as Chinese pine, oriental arborvitae, Chinese juniper, and white bark pine. The survival rate can reach 75% to 80%, and their growth is better than that of afforestation in the spring and autumn seasons, especially oriental arborvitae.

    Regarding broad-leaved trees, such as poplar, willow, and shrubby willow, cutting afforestation can be carried out during the rainy season, and the growth of Sophora japonica planted during the rainy season is also good.

    Tree species for rainy season sowing, such as Ailanthus altissima, maple, elm, Vitex negundo var. heterophylla, and Robinia pseudoacacia, can be selected and implemented depending on the location. However, the survival rate varies depending on the environment. Generally, Ailanthus altissima and Vitex negundo var. heterophylla are better, followed by maple, elm, and Robinia pseudoacacia.

    In addition, attention should be paid to tree species suitable for various types of land in the local area. For example, Chinese pine and oriental arborvitae on stony mountains, Chinese pine, Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa, and Ailanthus altissima on barren mountains, Chinese pine, oriental arborvitae, and Chinese juniper on gravelly sandy soil mountains, Sophora japonica, elm, maple, oriental arborvitae, Chinese juniper, and white bark pine on moderately dry and wet mountain slopes, and poplar and willow in wetlands, and shrubby willow in alkaline land.

　　山荒雨季造林
    华北农业科学研究所、造林研究室  纪人伟
    一、雨季造林的道理
    华北荒山造林之最大困难是土壤干燥，水分过少，地面没有草木被覆，雨水大部流失。大规模造林自然无法用人工灌溉，只有利用七、八两月雨季中天然的降水。根据过去统计，华北雨季约在阳历七八两月。雨季虽非整月阴雨连绵，不过昙雨之日较多，就北平一地来说，年降水量约五百公厘，而分布于七、八两月者即约百分之七○·四，在此两月中的降雨日占全年雨日的百分之三十三。树木之移栽，以在下列的时期，为最理想：（一）生长休止期，（二）发散作用较小时期，（三）空中湿度大，雨量多时期，（四）移栽后土壤尚保有多量水分时期。在山荒地区，雨季移栽可具有上述二、三、四项优点。再加上春秋两季造林，一年中可成为三季造林。并且在雨季中，除移植树木外，有些树种，尚可实行雨季播种。在华北干旱区域，尤其造林困难之山地，实施雨季造林，可免灌溉之苦。如植针叶树，其成活率比春秋二季造林为高。
    二、山荒雨季造林之方法及应注意事项
    １、在雨季前，将造林地整妥，植穴掘齐，以备盛雨水，使渗入土中。
    ２、久经荒废地面裸露的山地，一遇霪雨，流失甚大。如在极干旱之地段造林，最好先建简单的保水工程，使流失减少，增加渗透。如坡度大的山地，每隔相当距离，作成水平阶，阶之宽度，视苗木之大小而定，普通二市尺左右即可，阶面使其略向内方倾斜，借以保存水土，而于阶上挖穴植树。这样水土保持容易，而造林成活率必大。
    ３、整地、掘穴、保水、各种困难工作，可于事前做好，于雨后造林时，仅起苗、运苗、栽植等工作，比较简易；但要随时准备雨日来临，乘机加紧进行。栽植工作，能冒雨突击进行最佳。要充分把握时间，利用雨水。
    ４、起苗时应在阴雨时期举行，切勿伤损根部，若根部有损伤部分，应即剪去。如遇天晴，应将未用完运完之苗木，谨慎保护，可置于背阴处假植，根部应保持适当之湿润。运苗尤须特别注意，如路途远时，苗木根部应设法包好，勿使干燥。
    ５、在雨季植树造林中，栽植前因得充分雨水，土壤湿润。栽植后如遇晴日，在土壤尚未干燥前仍需要继续降雨，这样才能使林地土壤始终保持湿润；如久晴不雨，应尽力设法用人力灌溉，苗木由出圃上山以迄栽植完毕，应在阴雨的环境中进行工作，待其根部恢复再生力后，则虽有干燥亦可适应了。
    ６、此外我们对考查雨季确期，雨日分布，苗木年龄，行株距离，及保水方法，造林技术等，均须分别注意试验统计，期得正确结果。例如我们虽知国历七、八两月为华北的雨季，但还须详细统计华北各地或主要据点的气候变化与记载，以确定各地之正确雨季，而供造林上之参考。
    三、山荒雨季造林之树种
    山荒雨季造林树种之选择，实为一重要问题，就过去历年举行的雨季造林试验及一般经验，以针叶树类为最好，如油松、侧柏、桧柏、白皮松等。成活率可达百分之七十五至八十。且生长情形较春秋二季造林成绩为良好，尤以侧柏为最佳。
    关于阔叶树类，如杨、柳、杞柳等，均可于雨季行插条造林，国槐于雨季栽植生长亦佳。
    雨季播种之树种，如臭椿、枫树、榆树、荆条子、洋槐等，均可择地实行。但亦因环境之不同成活率时有差异。普通臭椿、荆条子较好，枫树、榆树、洋槐次之。
    此外应在乡土上注意适宜于各种土地之树种。如多石山地之油松、侧柏，瘠薄山地之油松、酸枣、臭椿，砾砂土山地之油松、侧柏、桧柏，干湿适度山坡地之国槐、榆树、枫树、侧柏、桧柏、白皮松，以及湿地之杨、柳，碱地之杞柳等。
