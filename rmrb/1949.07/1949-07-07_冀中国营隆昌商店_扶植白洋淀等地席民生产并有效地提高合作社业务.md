　　Jizhong State-Owned Longchang Store
    Supports Reed Mat Production in Baiyangdian and Effectively Improves Cooperative Business
    [Jizhong Electricity] Since February and until mid-June, the Jizhong State-Owned Longchang Store has supported reed mat production in Baiyangdian and Wen'anwa, solving the food difficulties of mat weavers. It sold 30,000 large reeds (each can weave five mat pieces) acquired last year to mat weavers through village cooperatives and wholesale markets. It also purchased 232,750 mat pieces, accounting for over 70% of all finished products. Each mat weaver's profit per mat piece is equivalent to three jin of corn, totaling 971,150 jin of corn in wages. In addition, the store supplied a total of 2,123,044 jin of food to mat weavers during these five months, playing a significant role in stabilizing prices. Especially before the wheat harvest, in the Laohetou area of Baiyangdian, borrowing one jin of red sorghum required returning one jin of wheat after the harvest. To prevent mat weavers from being subjected to this usurious exploitation, the store exchanged 40,000 jin of coarse grains at a ratio of one jin of rice for one jin of wheat after the wheat harvest, converting red sorghum and corn at market prices. This, combined with the Zhengzhou Cooperative Branch's exchange of farmers' wheat at a price 1% higher than the market price for coarse grains at a price 2% lower than the market price, greatly helped the development and establishment of cooperatives. To improve cooperative business, the store has entrusted village cooperatives to collect mats on its behalf since June, which not only saves the store's operating personnel but also allows the cooperatives to earn a 1% handling fee. Anxin Chengguan market collects over a hundred bundles (25 pieces per bundle) each market day. With the support of the Longchang Store, the lives and production materials of the reed mat weavers in Wen'anwa and Baiyangdian are assured of maintaining normal production and consumption.

　　冀中国营隆昌商店
    扶植白洋淀等地席民生产并有效地提高合作社业务
    【冀中电】冀中国营隆昌商店自二月初到六月中旬五个月以来扶植白洋淀文安洼席民生产，解决席民粮食困难，曾把去年收购的三万大个苇子（每个编席五片）通过村社和在集上批售供给席民，并购席子二三二，七五○片，占所有成品百分之七十以上。席民每片席利润以三斤玉米计，共得工资米九七一，一五○斤。又五个月中供给席民的食粮共有二一二三○四四斤之多。对稳定物价上起了很大作用。尤其麦收前，在白洋淀老河头一带借一斤红粮，麦收后就要还一斤麦子。为免除席民受到这种高利贷的剥削，该店曾以四万斤粗粮，以米一斤麦收后还一斤麦子的比价，将红粮、玉米按市价折合进行交换。并结合郑州合作分社以农民小麦高于市价百分之一交换低于市价百分之二的粗粮，对发展和建立合作社是帮助很大的。该店为提高合作社业务，自六月份起，已托村合作社代为收席，这样既可节省商店经营人员，且合作社还可取得百分之一的手续费。安新城关集每集即收百余捆（每捆二十五片）。文安洼，白洋淀席民生活生产资料在隆昌商店的扶植下，保持正常的生产与消费是不成问题的。
