Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 22nd: Polish News Agency, Warsaw dispatch: The Polish people have achieved significant successes in restoring and developing the national economy. Five years ago, when the Polish people began to recover from the ravages of war, 14,000 factories, 84,000 workshops, 162,000 houses, and 10,000 public buildings had been destroyed. In the past five years, the reconstruction of Warsaw alone cost 72 billion Zlotys (Polish currency); the reconstruction of other Polish towns, especially those in the recovered territories, reached 120 billion Zlotys; in Silesia, 3.8 million Zlotys were spent per square kilometer, and an average of 80,000 houses were built each year.

Under the Six-Year Plan, the total number of houses will increase to 660,000. 300,000 construction workers will work to complete this project. They will be equipped with machinery; these machines, coupled with the development of labor competitions, will guarantee the plan is completed on schedule. Three hundred and fifty factories employing 300,000 workers will be established in the next six years. Modern worker residential areas will be built near the factories. New towns will be evenly distributed throughout Poland. New factories and worker residential areas will be distributed in the provinces that were originally industrially backward. Poland's largest foundry, along with worker residential areas, will be established in Krakow Province. Another large foundry will be established in eastern Poland. The working class, which accounted for only 15 percent of the pre-war population, now accounts for 27 percent; by 1955, it will rise to 35 percent. Poland's urban design will take Warsaw as an example for implementation: the houses in the workers' areas will have ample space, light, greenery, and modern facilities; there will be convenient transportation between the worker residential areas and the factories; and more places for health care and maternal and child welfare services will be set up.

　　波兰大量发展建筑新的工厂住宅剧增
    【新华社北平二十二日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰人民在恢复和发展国民经济中已获得重大成绩。五年前，当波兰人民着手恢复战争创伤时，有一万四千家工厂，八万四千家作坊，十六万二千所住宅，和一万所公共建筑物，都已被毁。五年当中，单是重建华沙，就用了七百二十亿兹罗提（波币）；用于其他的波兰市镇，特别是那些收复区的重建，达一千二百亿兹罗提；在西里西亚，每平方公里耗款三百八十万兹罗提，每年平均修建了八万所住宅。
    在六年计划之下，住宅的总数将增至六十六万所。将有三十万建筑工人为完成此项工程而工作。他们将获得机器装备；这些机器装备，和劳动竞赛的发展配合起来，便将保证计划如期完成。雇用三十万工人的三百五十间工厂，将在未来六年中建立起来。现代化的工人住宅区将建于工厂附近。新的市镇将平均地分布于波兰全境。新的工厂与工人住宅区将分布于原先工业落后的诸省中。波兰规模最宏大的铸造厂，连同工人住宅区，将在克拉科省建立。另外一个大铸造厂，将建立于波兰东部。只占战前人口百分之十五的工人阶级，现在已达百分之二十七；到一九五五年时，将上升至百分之三十五。波兰的城市设计，将以华沙为实施的范例：工人区的房子将是有充足的空间、光线、草木和现代化的；工人住宅区与工厂之间，将有便利的交通工具往来联络；并将设置更多的保健与母婴福利事业的场所。
