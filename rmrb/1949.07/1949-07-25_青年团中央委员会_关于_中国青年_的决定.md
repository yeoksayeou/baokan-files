The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League
  Decision Regarding "China Youth"
    (July 20, 1949)
    I. Since the Youth League's representative assembly, the work of the League in various regions has generally seen significant progress. Many newly liberated cities have established League organizations. In order to promptly introduce exemplary cases, summarize experiences, prevent and correct biases in work, and strengthen the guidance of League members and the broad masses of youth in systematically conducting education in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Central Committee of the League has decided to convert the League Central Committee's official publication, "China Youth," into a weekly publication starting from the twelfth issue, and to enrich and improve this publication.
    II. Since its publication last winter, "China Youth" has implemented the directives of the CCP Central Committee's resolution on building the League and the resolutions of the League's representative assembly, which pointed out the "guidance of the Youth League's work and the organization of the broad masses of youth in learning," and has basically achieved great success. However, it has not been sufficiently integrated with revolutionary practice, that is, it has not been able to promptly and systematically provide guidance and assistance regarding the League's work and issues of immediate concern to youth. Although the League committees in various regions have already begun to pay attention to "China Youth" and have begun to use it to promote work, generally, they have not paid enough attention to writing articles, providing opinions, organizing correspondence, and helping with promotion and distribution. Some have even done nothing at all. Therefore, after "China Youth" is converted into a weekly publication, regarding how to enrich and improve the content of "China Youth" and how the League committees in various regions can utilize and assist this publication, the Central Committee of the League believes:
    (1) "China Youth Weekly" must truly achieve further integration with reality. First, it must address the issues of immediate concern to youth both inside and outside the League, such as learning, wages, occupations, family, social interaction, marriage, sports, and entertainment, and provide correct and systematic analysis. Second, it must guide the work of the League. It must be good at systematically reflecting the dynamics of the League in various regions, introducing the experiences of the League in various regions, and it must make typical introductions of a League branch, a task, a meeting, or a League member. Existing articles on cultural and scientific knowledge and literary works will continue to be published, and a weekly news section must be added. The language should be concise, clear, and easy to understand, so that youth with a middle school level of education can understand it.
    (2) League committees at all levels must attach great importance to this publication, and must fully utilize this publication as a powerful tool to promote work, and regard the opinions and important articles in this publication as instructions for work. They must publicize the importance of this publication both inside and outside the League. Responsible comrades of League committees at all levels must personally write articles and provide opinions for "China Youth Weekly," and tell their subordinate organizations to do the same. The propaganda departments of League committees at all levels should make writing articles, providing opinions, organizing correspondence, and helping with promotion and distribution for "China Youth Weekly" one of their regular tasks. League committees above the provincial level must provide at least one article per month to "China Youth Weekly." The correspondence groups of the official publications of League committees in various regions should also be the correspondence groups of "China Youth Weekly."
    III. After receiving this decision, the League's regional committees, provincial committees (or district League committees), municipal committees, prefectural committees, and county committees should convene a meeting to discuss "China Youth," put forward specific opinions on how to enrich this publication and how to utilize and assist this publication, and formulate plans for the aforementioned tasks. These opinions, plans, and the situation of correspondence, distribution, and other work related to "China Youth" in various regions must be written into a report and sent to us within one month.

### 青年团中央委员会　关于“中国青年”的决定

　　青年团中央委员会
  　关于“中国青年”的决定
    （一九四九年七月二十日）
    一、团的代表大会以后，各地团的工作一般地都有很大的开展。不少新解放的城市都建立了团。团中央为了及时介绍典型，总结经验并防止与纠正工作中的偏向，为了加强指导团员与广大青年有系统地进行马列主义、毛泽东思想的教育，特决定将团中央机关刊物——“中国青年”，从第十二期起，改出周刊，并充实与改进这个刊物。
    二、“中国青年”自去冬出刊以来，是执行了中共中央建团决议与团代表大会决议所指出“指导青年团的工作与组织广大青年学习”的方针的，基本上获得了很大的成绩。但是，和革命实际结合得不够，即对于团的工作与青年切身问题，还没有能够及时地有系统地加以指导与帮助。各地团委虽然对“中国青年”已经开始重视，开始利用它来推动工作，但是一般地在写稿、提意见、组织通讯、帮助推销发行上，注意得很不够的。有的甚至完全没有做。因此，在“中国青年”改为周刊以后，对于如何充实与改进“中国青年”的内容，对于各地团委如何利用与帮助这个刊物，团中央认为：
    （１）“中国青年周刊”，要确实做到更进一步地和实际结合。第一、解决团内外青年所最关心的切身问题，如学习、工资、职业、家庭、社交、婚姻、体育、娱乐等问题，加以正确的系统的分析。第二、指导团的工作。要善于系统地反映各地区团的动态，介绍各地区团的经验，并须将一个团支部、一件工作、一次会议、一个团员等，作有典型意义的介绍。现有的关于文化科学知识的文字和文艺作品等仍继续刊载，并须增加一周时事。在文字上力求简要、明白、浅显，使得具有中等文化水平的青年能够看懂。
    （２）各级团委要十分重视这个刊物，要充分利用这个刊物作为推动工作的有力的工具，以这个刊物里的言论与重要文章，作为工作上的指示去看。要在团内外宣传这个刊物的重要性。各级团委负责同志要亲自为“中国青年周刊”写稿与提意见，并且告诉所属的组织这样做。各级团委宣传部应把为“中国青年周刊”写稿、提意见、组织通讯、帮助推销发行，作为经常工作之一。团的省级以上委员会每月至少供给“中国青年周刊”稿件一篇。各地团委机关刊物的通讯组，应同时为“中国青年周刊”的通讯组。
    三、团的各区域委员会、省委（或区团委）、市委、地委、县委接到这个决定以后，应召开一次讨论“中国青年”的会议，对于如何充实这个刊物，如何利用与帮助这个刊物，提出具体意见，并将前项所指定的工作订出计划。须将这些意见、计划及各地“中国青年”的通讯、发行工作等情况，一并在一个月内写报告寄给我们。
