　　Chairman Mao's July 1st Thesis
    Tangshan's Various Circles Enthusiastically Study
    [Tangshan Dispatch] Workers, students, and cadres of government organs in various factories and mines in Tangshan City are enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's "July 1st" thesis, "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." The General Study Committee of the directly subordinate organs of the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee has specifically stipulated that the theoretical study of cadres in service be temporarily suspended, and one week will be used to study Chairman Mao's "July 1st" thesis. Most of the employees of Qixin Cement Company bought the pamphlet "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." In the course of study, some vague concepts were eliminated, and it was recognized that democracy could not be discussed with reactionaries and bureaucratic capitalists. After receiving the July 1st newspaper, the Telecommunications Bureau immediately organized all employees to study. The symposium of primary school teachers held during the summer vacation also began to study this document on the 13th and conduct discussions. Since its commencement on July 8th, the symposium of middle school teachers has launched the study of "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," and combined it with the study of Ren Bishi's political report at the National Congress of the Communist Youth League. There was a unanimous recognition that the revolution should be led by the working class, and the revolution led by the working class will surely be victorious.
    From July 2nd, five units of the Tangshan Institute of Engineering of Jiaotong University formed study groups, and have already held five discussions.

　　毛主席七一论文
    唐山各界热烈学习
    【唐山电】唐山市各厂矿工人、学生、机关干部热烈学习毛主席“七一”论文“论人民民主专政”。唐山市委直属各机关总学委会特规定暂停止在职干部的理论学习，以一周时间学习毛主席的“七一”论文。启新洋灰公司职工，大部买来“论人民民主专政”的单行本；在学习中消除了某些糊涂观念，认清了对反动分子和官僚资产阶级是不能讲民主的。电讯局接到七月一日的报纸后，立即组织了全体职工进行学习。在暑期举办的小学教师座谈会，也从十三日起开始学习这一文件，并进行讨论。中学教师座谈会自七月八日举办以来，就展开了“论人民民主专政”的学习，并结合学习任弼时在青年团全国代表大会上的政治报告。一致认识到革命应由工人阶级来领导，由工人阶级领导的革命一定获得胜利。
    中国交通大学唐山工学院，从七月二日起就有五个单位组成了学习小组，到目前已经讨论了五次。
