The literary and art workers of the liberated areas of China, since accepting Mao Zedong's policies and thoughts on literature and art, many comrades have gone to factories, rural areas, and among soldiers, practically participating in the liberation war, land reform, production competitions and other real-life and heroic struggles. In the process of continuously delving into the masses, observing, experiencing, and learning, they transformed their thinking, improved their political understanding, and learned the lively language of the masses. As a result, they wrote many works that served the masses and were welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In these works, we saw many moving stories, and many affirmed heroes and model figures were presented in literary and artistic works. The most prominent and praiseworthy thing we saw from these better works was the noble qualities of Communist Party members.

Old Liang, who, as a leader in smelting steel, forgot his own illness, insisted on not sleeping for three days and three nights, and completed an arduous task with the entire team of workers, appearing in the literary and artistic film "Bridge," is an excellent Communist Party member. In this film, Old Liang's strong will to "strive to complete the entrusted work" is fully demonstrated. He does not stop in the face of difficulties, he discovers fire-resistant bricks to replace firestone. He is careful in his work, not careless, and he educates and unites the masses at all times. As a result, the backward became active, and the active exerted even greater strength. The first steel smelting went wrong, and after inspection and research, the second was successful. Old Liang's hard work style has always influenced other workers, forming a core working force. Such noble qualities could not have appeared in the old society or in capitalist factories. Only under the party's cultivation and education could such qualities be produced. Such a character, through film art, moved the broad audience, enabling the audience to recognize the concrete image of workers overcoming all difficulties and completing great tasks.

"Born great, died gloriously." Liu Hulan, a rural party member, was brought to the opera stage. She was originally an ordinary and poor young woman from Zhou Village in Yunxi. After the party's education and training, she consciously and automatically led the masses to make military shoes and comfort soldiers at the front. Seeing our wounded soldiers, she immediately helped them home, washing their wounds, changing their medicine, washing their clothes, and sending them water and food, as if they were her own brothers. The feudal landlords in the village and the Guomindang troops outside were constantly conspiring and persecuting them and the active masses in the village. And she, together with other cadres in the village, planned production, supported the front, and carried out various struggles against the enemy. Until the very end, when the district notified her to temporarily hide in the marginal area, her first consideration was how to arrange work, send away the wounded soldiers, and encourage the masses, without thinking about personal danger. As a result, she was captured by the enemy. After several tortures and interrogations, her answer was "Communist Party members are not afraid of death, those who are afraid of death are not Communist Party members." Such an indomitable character, living for the people, dying for the people, constantly fighting for the interests of the masses during his lifetime, and forever commemorated by the masses after his death—the image of a Communist Party member with noble qualities—has been vividly portrayed by our literary and artistic writers. What is revealed to the broad audience is that countless such party members are leading the masses, defeating all enemies, and creating our new history.

Speaking of the noble qualities of Communist Party members in the military, there are countless examples. The People's Liberation Army was originally a force armed with political education, class consciousness, and Mao Zedong Thought. In thousands of anti-Japanese wars and liberation wars, the noble qualities of Communist Party members in combat were demonstrated everywhere. Reflected in reports, paintings, and works were Liang Shiying, who sacrificed himself to kill the enemy, Lü Shunbao, who became a role model for soldiers after being injured and not leaving the front line, and Wang Keqin, who created a combat model and the excellent work style of the Wang Keqin class. He was a prisoner of war who, after being liberated, improved his class consciousness under the education and influence of our party and deeply regretted being deceived by the US-Chiang Kai-shek clique. Ideologically, he approached the people and the Communist Party. Through continuous learning, transformation, and improvement, he became an excellent Communist Party member. Although there were only twelve people in a class, under his leadership and education, the class improved its skills and launched a mutual aid movement, which enabled good unity among new and old soldiers. Their studies and exercises were all in preparation for combat power, to go to the battlefield to make contributions to the people. As a result, Wang Keqin became a hero in killing the enemy and also a hero in mutual assistance. The soldiers will always remember his lesson: "At home, rely on parents, in revolution, rely on mutual assistance." Such noble qualities could only be produced in the People's Liberation Army!

Here, I have only cited a few small examples from movies and scripts. In many other novels, paintings, poems, lyrics, and news reports, I don’t know how many similar noble qualities to the above have been expressed by our literary and art workers. This correctly illustrates that the workers, peasants, and soldiers under the leadership of our party, after long and arduous tests and struggles, have continuously emerged with new models, new characters, and new stories worth expressing. And those noble qualities are still constantly being produced and growing in factories, troops, rural areas, and in schools, hospitals, news, and other work. Although we have achieved certain results in our past expressions in our works, when we compare our works with what reality requires us to express, we feel that the images of noble characters that we have expressed in our works are really too few.

Now, the whole country is about to be liberated. Our literary and art workers have all the opportunities to approach the workers, peasants, and soldiers and learn from them. Workers have become masters in factories, peasants have mastered land and production tools, and soldiers are fighting to completely eliminate the reactionary enemies. Everything is being reborn, everything is changing, everything is developing. New characters and new noble qualities will be reflected more in our works. We are facing a great and magnificent era, and this era will give us an infinite and rich source of creation. We must use our thoughts and pens more, and create typical characters that are familiar and loved by the broad masses in a serious, simple, true, and moving way—noble qualities that represent the great spirit of our party!

　　文艺作品中共产党员的高尚品质
    白河
    中国解放区的文学、艺术工作者，自从接受了毛泽东的文艺政策、思想以后，不少的同志到工厂、到农村、到战士中去，实际参加了解放战争、土地改革、生产竞赛等现实生活与英勇斗争。在不断地深入群众、观察、体验、学习的过程中，改造了思想，提高了政治认识，学到了群众生动活泼的语言，于是写出了不少为群众服务、被工农兵大众喜闻乐见的作品。在这些作品中，我们看到了许多可歌可泣的故事、不少肯定的英雄、模范人物表现在文学、艺术作品里。最突出而值得夸耀的，我们从这些较好的作品中，看到了共产党员的高尚品质。
    做为一个领导化钢炉，忘记了自己的病苦，坚持三天三夜不去睡眠，和全组工人完成了艰巨任务，出现在文艺巨片“桥”中的老梁，他是一个优秀的共产党员。在这部影片里，充分地表现了老梁“要为完成所委托的工作而奋斗”底坚强意志，他不停留在困难面前，他发现了耐火砖来代替火云石。在工作中他细心，不粗枝大叶，他随时随地教育、团结群众。结果，落后的积极了，积极的更发挥了大的力量。第一次炼钢出了毛病，经过检查、研究，第二次成功了。老梁的艰苦作风，始终影响着其他工人，形成了一个工作的核心力量。这样高尚的品质，在旧社会以及资产阶级的工厂里是没法出现的，只有在党的培养、教育下才能产生如此的品质。这样的人物，通过电影艺术，感动了广大的观众，使观众认识到工人战胜一切困难，完成了伟大任务的具体人物形象。
    “生的伟大，死的光荣”。做为一个农村党员，搬上歌剧舞台的刘胡兰。她原是一个云西周村的平凡而穷苦的年青妇女，经过了党的教育、培养，她自觉自动地领导群众，做军鞋、到前线慰劳战士。看见我们的伤员，马上扶回家来，给他洗伤口、换药、洗衣服、送水送饭、象对待她亲兄弟一样。村里的封建地主，外边的勾子军，时时刻刻都在阴谋、迫害着她们和村里的积极群众。而她，和村中的其他干部，计划着生产、支前、对敌进行种种斗争。直到最后区里通知她暂时隐蔽到边缘区的时候，她首先考虑到的是如何布置工作，送走伤员，鼓励群众，却没想到个人的危险。结果，她被敌人捉去了，经过几次拷打、审问，她回答的是“共产党员不怕死，怕死不当共产党员”。这样一个坚强不屈的性格，生为人民、死为人民、生前时时为群众利益而斗争，死后永远被群众所纪念的共产党员。——具有高尚品质的共产党员的形象，被我们的文艺作家生动地刻划出来了。启示给广大观众的是无数的这样党员在领导着群众，战胜了一切敌人，创造了我们新的历史。
    提到战士中的共产党员高尚的品质，那更是数不胜数了。人民解放军原是有政治教育、阶级觉悟、有毛泽东思想武装起来了的部队。在千百次抗日战争、解放战争中、在在表现了共产党员在战斗中的高尚品质。反映到报告、绘画、作品中的有舍身杀敌的梁世英，有受伤不下火线成为战士榜样的吕顺保，有创造了战斗模范、优良作风王克勤班的王克勤。——他是一个俘虏，解放过来以后，在我党教育、影响下，他提高了阶级觉悟，深深地翻悔了受了美蒋的欺骗，思想上靠近了人民，靠近了共产党。在不断地学习、改造、提高中成了优秀的共产党员。虽然一个班只有十二个人，但在他的领导、教育下，他们这个班提高了技术，开展了互助运动，使新老战士有了很好的团结。他们的学习、操练都是为了准备起战斗力量，为人民到战场去立功，结果，王克勤成了杀敌英雄也是互助英雄，战士永远记住他的教训：“在家靠父母，革命靠互助”。这样高尚的品质只有在人民解放军里才能产生出来的吧！
    这里，只就电影、剧本中举了几个小小的例子。其他，在许多小说、绘画、诗歌、唱词、新闻报导中，不知有多少类似以上那些高尚的品质，都被我们的文学、艺术工作者表现出来了。这正确切地说明了在我党领导下的工农兵大众，他们经过了长期艰苦的考验、斗争，不断地涌现了新的典型、新的人物、新的值得表现的故事。而那些高尚的品质，也还正不断地在工厂、部队、农村、以及学校、医院、新闻等工作上产生着、滋长着，已往我们所表现在作品中的，虽然有了一定的成绩，但拿作品对现实所要求我们要表现的作一个比较衡量，就又感到我们已表现到作品里的高尚品质底人物形象实在太少了。
    现在，全国将要解放，我们文学、艺术工作者有了一切接近工农兵，向工农兵学习的机会，工人在工厂做了主人，农民掌握了土地及生产工具，战士在做着彻底消灭反动敌人的斗争。一切在新生，一切在变革，一切在发展，新的人物，新的高尚的品质，将更多地被我们反映到作品里来。我们正面临着一个伟大而瑰丽的时代，这个时代将给予我们无限的创作的丰富源泉，我们不能不多用思想、用笔，严肃、朴素、真实而动人的去创造广大群众所熟悉、热爱的典型性格。——代表我党伟大精神的高尚品质！
