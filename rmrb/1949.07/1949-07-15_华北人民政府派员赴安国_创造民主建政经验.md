　　North China People's Government Sends Personnel to Anguo to Create Democratic Governance Experience
　　[This Newspaper] In order to create experience and guide the democratic governance work in the whole region, the North China People's Government has decided to take Anguo County, the ninth special district of Hebei Central, as an experimental county, and sent four comrades from the Civil Affairs Office, including Liu @, to guide the area; the Hebei Central Administrative Office and the Ninth Special Office also sent cadres to key villages to help. At the county government work conference, the resolution of the North China People's Government on democratic governance work was conveyed. The Anguo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of rural branch party members and cadres from 175 villages in the county on the 30th of last month, with more than 600 people attending. Comrade Chen Ke, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, conveyed the County Party Committee's instructions on democratic governance work. The County Party Committee made a self-criticism of the past work of the Party and the government, saying: With the joint efforts of all Party and government staff, there have been many achievements. However, there are still many shortcomings in the Party's work. For example, some party members' substitution for the village-level government's work, the leadership's "one-size-fits-all meeting," resulted in the separation of party and government, so that the scope of functions and the boundaries of leadership were not clear enough. In individual areas, party members did not pay enough attention to and respect government work, did not trust the masses, and thus lost the core leadership role of the party. For the future governance work, the County Party Committee emphasized: We must fully implement the spirit of the mass line, under the leadership of the Party, let the masses do it freely, and there must be no substitution or coercion. The Party's leadership over the masses can only influence and drive the masses with the exemplary role of party members. In the implementation of the government's instructions and plans, every party member must ensure implementation, and influence and drive the masses with their exemplary role, and prevent both substitution and the tendency of extreme democratization.
　　In terms of specific work steps, it was pointed out that: In the publicity and deliberation before the election, first listen to the opinions of the masses, the branch should absorb and study the opinions of the masses at any time, put forward their own opinions, and then discuss with the masses to achieve the unity of the party and the masses' opinions, so that the election of administrative personnel can be guided and fully democratic discussion. Attention should be paid to the following points in the election work: (1) Representatives should be the most active and responsible elements in the great production and wheat levy and flood control work; (2) Whether they are party member cadres or mass cadres, as long as they can implement policies and sincerely work for the people, they can be elected; (3) Strive for a certain number of women to be elected; (4) The composition should be mainly working people, especially farmers who have turned over; (5) Strengthen solidarity education at all times; (6) Strictly prevent the party from arranging elections for the masses and relatives. This is illegal and violates the democratic freedom rights of the people.

　　华北人民政府派员赴安国
  　创造民主建政经验
    【本报讯】华北人民政府为创造经验，指导全区民主建政工作，特决定以冀中九专区安国县为实验县，并派民政处刘＠等四同志亲往该区指导；冀中行政公署及九专署亦派干部深入重点村帮助。在该县府工作会议上，传达了华北人民政府关于民主建政工作的决议。中共安国县委会，并于上月三十日召开全县一百七十五个村的农村支部党员干部会议，到会者共六百余人。县委副书记陈克同志传达县委对民主建政工作的指示，县委对过去党与政府工作作了自我批评说：在全体党政工作人员的共同努力下，有很多成绩。但党的工作缺点仍很多。如某些党员对村级政府工作的包办代替，领导上的“一揽子会议”，造成党政不分，以致职权范围和领导界限不够明确。个别地区党员对政府工作重视和尊重不够，不相信群众，因而失去了党的核心领导作用。对今后建政工作，县委强调提出：必须充分贯彻群众路线精神，在党的领导下，放手让群众干，不能有任何的包办代替和强迫命令。党对群众的领导，只有凭党员的模范作用影响和带动群众。在对政府指示计划的执行上，每个党员都必须保证贯彻执行，以自己的模范作用，影响和带动群众，既要防止包办代替，但也要防止极端民主化的偏向。
    在具体工作步骤上，指出：在选举前的宣传酝酿中，首先在群众中酝酿听取群众意见，支部应随时吸取并研究群众意见，提出自己的意见，再到群众中商量，求得党和群众意见的一致，这样就可使行政人员的选举成为有领导的，经过了充分民主讨论的。在选举工作中要注意：（一）代表应当是在大生产中和麦征、防汛工作中最积极负责的分子；（二）无论党员干部和群众干部，只要能执行政策、诚心诚意为人民办事的，都可当选；（三）争取有一定数量的妇女当选；（四）成份以劳动人民特别是翻身农民为主；（五）时时刻刻加强团结教育；（六）在党内严防对群众、亲友布置选举。这是违法的，是侵犯了人民的民主自由权利。
