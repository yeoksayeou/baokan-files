　　First Through Train in Twelve Years!
　　Direct Ping-Hu Service to Begin on the 10th
　　Two Round Trips Daily, Two Days to Reach Destination
　　First Direct Train Departed Shanghai on July 1st.
　　Tianjin-Pukou Direct Train Also Scheduled to Open on the 10th.
　　[Report from Our Newspaper] To connect the transportation between North China, Central China, and East China, and to strengthen the connection between Shanghai, China's largest commercial port, and Beijing, the nation's political center, the Ministry of Railways has specifically scheduled the opening of direct trains between Beijing and Shanghai starting July 10th. Direct train service between Beijing and Shanghai has been unavailable for twelve years since the July 7th Incident and the retreat of the Kuomintang of the specially equipped ferries "Nanjing" and "Pukou" between Pukou and Nanjing to Yichang, Hubei, in the autumn of 1937. During the liberation of Nanjing this time, the reactionaries, unwilling to return the people's property to the people, sunk the "Nanjing" ferry. Only the "Pukou" ferry remains to undertake the task of ferrying trains across the river. The Huai River Bridge was officially opened to traffic on "July 1st" after heroic repairs by railway workers, ensuring smooth north-south passenger and freight transportation, which guaranteed the possibility of opening the direct train service between Beijing and Shanghai.
　　After the opening of the service, the 11th and 12th trains will run daily in both directions between Beijing and Shanghai, with numbered tickets sold to maintain order. The train will consist of six third-class passenger cars, one second-class sleeper car, one first-class sleeper car, one first and second-class combined car, one dining car, one baggage car, and one baggage and postal car, totaling twelve cars. The intermediate stops will include 26 stations: Tianjin East Station, Tianjin North Station, Duliu, Cangxian, Lianzhen, Dexian, Yucheng, Jinan, Tai'an, Yanzhou, Tengxian, Lincheng, Xuzhou, Fuliji, Suxian, Guzhen, Bengbu, Mingguang, Chuzhou, Pukou, Nanjing, Zhenjiang West Station, Danyang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Kunshan. Train No. 11 will depart from Beijing at 17:25 daily, depart from Tianjin at 20:02, depart from Jinan at 6:48 the next day, depart from Xuzhou at 15:15, arrive at Nanjing at 7:55 on the third day, and arrive in Shanghai at 15:00, taking a total of 45 hours and 35 minutes. Train No. 12 will depart from Shanghai at 23:30 daily, depart from Nanjing at 8:55 the next day, depart from Xuzhou at 1:06 on the third day, depart from Jinan at 9:22, depart from Tianjin East Station at 20:20, and arrive in Beijing at 22:40, taking a total of 47 hours and 15 minutes.
　　In addition, direct passenger trains No. 221 and No. 222 between Tianjin and Pukou will also run daily in both directions starting July 10th, consisting of one baggage car, one first and second-class car, one second-class car, one dining car, and ten third-class passenger cars. To facilitate passengers, the trains will stop at major stations along the way. The southbound journey will take 35 hours and 31 minutes, and the northbound journey will take 35 hours and 15 minutes. Starting from the same day, tickets will be sold in different classes (first, second, and third class), and ticket prices will be set separately.
　　[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the successful trial operation of the Huai River Bridge on June 30th, the first direct train from Shanghai to Beijing departed from Shanghai at 22:00 yesterday (July 1st) and is expected to arrive in Beijing on July 3rd. The Ministry of Railways attaches great importance to this, as it is the first through train between Beijing and Shanghai in twelve years, and is currently preparing to welcome it. The people across the nation are extremely excited to hear about this.

　　十二年来首次通车！
  　平沪直达车十日起开行
  　每日对开两次两天可达
    第一列直达车七一已由沪开出
  　津浦直达车亦定十日通车
    【本报讯】道部为贯通华北、华中、华东之间交通，加强中国最大商埠——上海和全国的政治中心——北平之间的连系，特定于七月十日起开行平沪直达列车。北平至上海间直达车自七七事变发生，一九三七年秋国民党将浦口、南京间特备轮渡南京号、浦口号撤退至湖北宜昌后，已有十二年未曾通车。此次南京解放时，反动派又因不甘将人民的财产交回给人民手中，将南京号炸沉，现仅剩浦口号担负列车渡江任务。淮河大桥经铁路工人的英勇抢修于“七一”正式通车，使南北客货运畅通无阻，才保证了此次平沪直达车开行的可能性。
    通车以后，每日由北平至上海对开第十一次及第十二次两次列车，又为保持秩序，对号售票。计挂三等客车六辆，二等寝车一辆，一等寝车一辆，一、二等合造车一辆，餐车一辆，行李车一辆，行李邮政车一辆，共十二辆车皮。中途停车站计有天津东站、天津北站、独流、沧县、连镇、德县、禹城、济南、泰安、兖州、滕县、临城、徐州、符离集、宿县、固镇、蚌埠、明光、滁州、浦口、南京、镇江西站、丹阳、无锡、苏州、昆山共二十六站。十一次车每日十七点二十五分由北平开出，二十点零二分由天津开出，第二天六点四十八分由济南开出，十五点十五分由徐州开出，第三天七点五十五分由南京开出，十五点到上海，共走行四十五小时三十五分。十二次车每日二十三点三十分由上海开出，第二天八点五十五分由南京开出，第三天一点零六分由徐州开出，九点二十二分由济南开出，二十点二十分由天津东站开出，二十二点四十分到北平。共计走行四十七小时十五分。
    又天津至浦口间直达旅客列车二二一次、二二二次，亦自七月十日起每日对开一次，计挂行李车一辆，一、二等车一辆，二等车一辆，餐车一辆，三等客车十辆。为便利旅客沿途大站均停车。下行共需时三十五小时三十一分，上行三十五小时十五分。并自同日起分等售票（计分一二三等），票价另有规定。
    【本报讯】由于淮河大桥六月三十日试运转成功，由上海至北平第一列直达车已于昨日（七月一日）二十二点由上海开出，预计七月三日可以到达北平。铁道部极为重视，十二年来平沪第一次通车，现正筹备欢迎。全国人民闻之异常兴奋。
