　　The Restoration and Development of Production in Shijiazhuang
　　--Excerpts from Deputy Mayor Zang Boping's Report at the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Congress
　　Note: Deputy Mayor Zang Boping's report at the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Congress on the work of the People's Government over the past year and a half is divided into eight sections, with the restoration and development of production being the first.

　　Shijiazhuang is an important city in North China that was liberated at the beginning of the People's Liberation War's transition to the offensive phase. At the beginning of its establishment, the People's Democratic Government announced the policy of developing industry and commerce and building a people's city for the long term. In the year and eight months of work, it encountered many obstacles. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits sent special agents to carry out conspiracies and sabotage activities, and repeatedly invaded and bombed with aircraft, and even arrogantly attempted to sneak attacks twice. Under the correct leadership of the superior Party and government, the heroic battles of the People's Liberation Army, and the joint efforts of the Party, government, army, and people of the city, the obstacles were overcome, enabling Shijiazhuang's industry and commerce to gradually move from recovery to development.
　　After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, thanks to the correct implementation of the New Democratic economic policy by the democratic government and the efforts of all the people, the city's industry and commerce have gradually recovered and developed. At present, there are more than 70 state-owned enterprises engaged in machine industry and handicrafts, and more than 40 commercial enterprises. Over the past year, these state-owned enterprises have played a significant role in developing production, ensuring supply, and stabilizing prices. In the private industrial and commercial sector, the democratic government and state-owned enterprises have provided as much support as possible to those that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and are needed by the broad masses of the people, such as loans, supply of raw materials, and acquisition of finished products to help them recover and develop. At the beginning of liberation, there were only more than 700 private industrial and handicraft enterprises in the city, but now they have developed to more than 1,700. There were originally more than 1,500 private commercial enterprises, and now there are more than 2,100. Among them, such as silver shops, gold shops, silk shops, and fragrance factories, have not been able to develop or have simply declined because they are not needed by the broad masses of the people. Since January of this year, due to the successive liberation of large cities and price fluctuations caused by the spring drought, industry and commerce have shown some signs of sluggish business. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon and a difficulty in development, and now it is gradually improving. Because the city has convenient transportation and a supply of industrial raw materials such as coal, iron, and cotton, the future for industrial development is very great. At present, it is necessary to improve quality and improve technology to achieve high quality and low prices. This must rely on the working class to develop production.
　　Over the past year, the working class of the city has played a great role in the restoration and development of production. In the movement to increase production and make up for losses, especially in this Red May competition movement, the working class has shown amazing achievements. At the beginning of the city's liberation, the democratic government paid attention to the work of workers. After the North China Industrial and Commercial Conference and the Sixth National Labor Congress, the policy of democratization of factory management and taking care of the vital interests of employees, and mobilizing the masses to run factories well has gradually become clear. Generally, workers have received wages in kind, and consumer cooperatives have also been organized to ensure the supply of living materials. In the future, people's engineers, technicians, staff, and workers are required to unite closely to further improve productivity.
　　Regarding the city's cooperative undertakings, we lacked experience in the past. After more than a year of exploration, we realized that vigorously organizing supply and marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and, where conditions permit, organizing production cooperatives is the correct path for the current urban cooperative undertakings. As of the end of June, there were 17 citizen consumer branches in the city, with 10,444 members, 11 employee consumer cooperatives, with 11,140 members, 4 agricultural supply and marketing cooperatives, with 742 members, and 62 production cooperatives, with 1,822 members. The cooperative also played a significant role in organizing women to participate in production in conjunction with the Women's Federation. In order to facilitate farmers' supply and marketing, a farmers' service center was also established this year, which is one of the important characteristics of a people's city. Land reform has been completed in urban and rural areas, and farmers have been guaranteed a living. The government has also issued agricultural loans. Last year, agricultural loans amounted to 4 billion Border Region currency, and this year another 100,000 jin of cotton seeds and nearly 600,000 jin of fertilizer were loaned. As of the end of May this year, farmers in the suburbs of the city have dug more than 600 wells, added and repaired more than 250 waterwheels, and increased livestock by more than 1,000 heads with the help of the government. The Shijiazhuang-Tianjin Canal irrigation canal has been released, which can irrigate 200,000 mu of land. In addition, the democratic government has also provided relief to citizens who are indeed unable to support themselves. In addition to the reformatories, temporary relief grain and funds have been distributed. According to incomplete statistics, more than 200,000 jin of grain and more than 200,000 yuan of people's currency were distributed by the end of March this year. There are also some shortcomings in the work: for example, in the past, state-owned enterprises lacked a unified pace in their economies for a considerable period of time. Secondly, we have not done enough in uniting legitimate private industrialists and businessmen to fight against speculative merchants. The industrial and commercial tax, which was for half a year last year, was collected later, and the merchants felt the tax was heavy because it was accumulated for half a year. This year, it has been changed to monthly collection.

　　石市生产的恢复与发展
    ——臧伯平副市长在石市人代大会报告的节录
    按：石市人代大会上臧伯平副市长报告一年半来的人民市政府工作，内容共分八项，恢复与发展生产问题为报告之第一项。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    石家庄是人民解放战争转入进攻阶段华北首获解放的重要城市。人民民主政府在成立之初，就宣布发展工商业长期建设人民城市的方针。一年零八个月的工作中，曾遇到很多的阻碍，蒋匪派遣特务进行阴谋破坏活动，并多次以飞机侵扰轰炸，还曾狂妄的两度企图偷袭，在上级党与政府的正确领导、解放军的英勇作战与全市党政军民的共同努力下，战胜阻碍，使石市的工商业由恢复逐渐走上发展。
    石市解放后由于民主政府正确的执行了新民主主义的经济政策及全体人民的努力，使本市工商业逐渐恢复发展，现全市公营企业有机器工业与手工业七十余家，商业共四十余家。一年多来，这些公营企业在发展生产、保证供给、稳定物价等方面都起了很大作用。私营工商业方面，有益于国计民生而为广大人民需要的，民主政府和公营企业尽量给与扶助，如贷款、供给原料、收购成品等帮助其恢复发展。解放初本市私营工业和手工业只七百多家，现已发展到一千七百多家。私营商业原有一千五百多家，现有二千一百多家。其中如银楼、金店、绸缎、香厂等，因不为广大人民需要，未能得到发展或根本没落了。今年一月以来，由于大城市的相继解放及春旱物价波动等原因，工商业曾呈现了一些营业不振的景象，但这只是暂时的现象，是发展中的困难，现在已渐趋好转。因本市交通便利，有煤、铁、棉花等工业原料的供给，工业发展前途很大，目前必须提高质量、改良技术，达到价廉物美，这就必须依靠工人阶级，才能发展生产。
    一年多来，本市的工人阶级在恢复与发展生产中，曾发挥了伟大的力量。在增产补损运动特别是这次红五月竞赛运动中，工人阶级表现出的惊人的成绩。在本市解放之初，民主政府就曾注意到工人工作，在华北工商会议和全国六次劳动大会后，工厂管理民主化和照顾职工切身利益，发动群众办好工厂的方针逐渐明确。一般工人都获得了实物工资，同时还组织了消费合作社，生活资料的供给得到保障，今后要求人民的工程师、技术人员、职员和工人紧密的团结起来，使生产力更加提高。
    关于城市的合作事业是，我们过去缺乏经验，经过一年多的摸索，认识到大力组织供销社、消费社与有条件的组织生产社，是目前城市合作事业的正确道路。截至六月底止，本市共有市民消费分社十七个，社员一○、四四四人，职工消费社十一个，社员一一、一四○人，农业供销社四个，社员七四二人，生产合作社六十二个，社员一、八二二人。合作社结合妇联会在组织妇女参加生产上，也起了很大作用。为了便利农民供销，今年并建立了农民服务所，这是人民城市的重要特点之一。市区农村，已完成了土地改革，农民在生活上有了保障，政府还发放了农贷，去年农贷达边币四十亿，今年又贷棉籽十万斤，肥料近六十万斤。截至今年五月底止，市郊农民在政府帮助下，共凿井六百多孔，新添和修补水车二百五十多架，增加牲口一千头以上。石津运河灌溉渠已放水，可浇地二十万亩。此外，民主政府对确无生活能力的市民也进行了救济，除教养院外，发放临时性救济粮款，据不完全统计，到今年三月底即发放了粮二十多万斤，款人民券二十多万元。工作中还有一些缺点：如过去在相当时期内公营企业经济尚缺乏统一的步调，其次在团结正当私营工商业家共同与投机商人作斗争这一点，做的也不够。去年以半年为期的工商税，因开征较迟，半年积在一起，商户感到税重，今年已改为月征。　　　　　　　（石家庄分社）
