　　Yuci Trading Branch
  　Unconditionally Trusts Private Merchants
    Causing Great Losses to the State
    Company Manager and Deputy Manager Disciplined
    [Taiyuan Electric] The Yuci branch of the Taiyuan Trading Company, in its grain purchasing work, abandoned necessary vigilance and struggle against speculative private merchants, resulting in being defrauded of public funds and having a huge amount of millet owed. Before the liberation of Taiyuan, the Yuci Trading Branch, in order to support the Taiyuan campaign, entrusted private merchant Liu Junxian to purchase some grain on its behalf. At first, this private merchant was able to deliver the goods on time in order to gain trust, but at the same time, Liu also used methods of flattery and bribery such as inviting people to dinner and the theater. At that time, the branch company neither understood the capital base of the business nor investigated the business's partners and operations. In April, they ordered 25,000 catties of millet from Liu and paid the full amount immediately, but the millet was stored by Liu. Later, the branch company allocated 23,500 catties of rice to the Shijiazhuang Tongpu Railway Supply Cooperative, but the cooperative only took away 5,573 catties, and the remaining grain was stored in Liu's home. On April 20th, the branch company again ordered 30,000 catties of wheat and more than 20,000 catties of miscellaneous grains from Liu, only taking a grain receipt as evidence. After Liu Junxian received the money, he bought a large amount of cloth, oil, and salt to speculate in Taiyuan. It was not until mid-May that the branch company discovered Liu's speculative activities and demanded grain from him. At that time, there was very little grain stored in Liu's home. He pieced it together and discounted the cloth, oil, and salt stored in Taiyuan to offset the grain, but still owed more than 10,000 catties that could not be returned. After the Shijiazhuang Tongpu Railway Supply Cooperative received the news, they came to demand grain but were also unsuccessful. In this way, the state lost nearly 30,000 catties of grain. When dealing with this issue, the branch company initially called Liu to the branch company to clear the accounts, but before the procedures were completed, they released him, and Liu immediately hid in Taiyuan, and was later captured by the government. After this incident occurred, the Yuci Chengguan District Government reported to the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government, but the Yuci branch company did not report to the Taiyuan Municipal Company for a long time. The Taiyuan Trading Company has now issued a notice criticizing the company's lack of principled trust in private merchants, violating trade policies by engaging in buying and selling without goods, and the undisciplined phenomenon of failing to promptly request instructions and report, giving the branch company's manager Li Yu and deputy manager Yang Shengde a public reprimand.

　　榆次贸易分公司
  　无原则信任私商
    造成国家大损失
    公司正副经理受到处分
    【太原电】太原市贸易公司榆次分公司在购粮工作中，对投机私商放弃了必要的警惕与斗争，致被骗取公款，拖欠巨额小米。太原解放前，榆次贸易分公司为了支援太原战役，曾委托私商刘俊贤代购一部粮食，该私商开始时为了取得信任，尚能准时交货，但同时刘又对分公司干部进行麻痹利诱如请吃饭、看戏。当时该分公司，既不了解该商号的资财铺底，又未考查该号人伙及经营情形，于四月份向刘订购小米两万五千斤，即时将款按数付清，但小米由刘保存，后来分公司将米拨给石家庄同蒲铁路供应社二万三千五百斤，但该社只取走了五千五百七十三斤，余粮又存于刘家中。四月二十日分公司又向刘订购了三万斤麦子，两万多斤杂粮，仅取粮条一纸为据，该刘俊贤得到款后，即买了大批布、油、盐到太原投机。到五月中旬，分公司才发现刘有投机行为，向其要粮。当时刘家中存粮很少，东拼西凑，并将太原所存之布、油、盐都折价顶粮，结果还欠一万多斤无法归还。石家庄同蒲铁路供应社得讯后，来要粮亦未要到。这样使国家共损失了近三万斤粮食的财富。分公司在处理这一问题时，开始将刘叫到分公司清理帐目，手续未完，即将人放走，刘当即潜匿太原，后来才被政府捕获。这一事件发生后，榆次城关区区政府即向太原市人民政府作报告，而榆次分公司却很久未向太原市公司报告。该公司此种无原则的信任私商，违犯贸易政策进行买空，与不及时请示报告的无纪律现象，太原市贸易公司现已通报，给该分公司经理丽裕、副经理杨盛德以公开的批评处分。
