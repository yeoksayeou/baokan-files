Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th: The full text of Mr. Soong Ching-ling's speech at the Shanghai People from All Walks of Life Commemorating the July 7th Incident and Celebrating Liberation Conference is as follows:

　　In Chinese history, imperialist aggression is a frequently seen event, and the "July 7th Incident" marks one of the aggressions suffered by the Chinese people. But "July 7th" is also a day with special significance. Because the bloody invasion of our lives and property by the Japanese warlords in 1937 also changed the face of the entire international front at that time. I believe that everyone here will remember how the Japanese warlords once boasted that the Chinese army could not resist for three months. However, everyone also knows that despite the enemy's frantic bombing and the navy's use of artillery to cover the attack, we fought the enemy for three months in Shanghai alone. How was it possible to defend undefended Shanghai? The answer to this question is: in order to defend our national independence, every patriotic Chinese people was prepared to sacrifice, which formed a warning. It must be admitted that the great significance of this warning is gradually strengthening, because the Chinese people today are in an even more invincible position. For the first time in our long history, we have a real people's army, behind which is the power of all our people. In addition, our heroic struggle and victory for national independence and freedom have shaken the foundation of the imperialists' rule in China and Asia, and their labor is collapsing. Therefore, we issue a serious warning to the imperialists who attempt to stop our great democratic wave, and we issue a serious warning to the reactionaries who vainly create an international war smokescreen and threaten the peaceful aspirations of the people's democratic forces: Get out! Otherwise you will perish together. On this year's "July 7th," we Chinese people confidently look forward to a glorious future for our country, when the people's nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood will be brilliantly realized together. We also foresee the happiness of our great people and great country. Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　上海纪念七七大会上
  　宋庆龄警告帝国主义
    滚开吧！否则将与反动派同归于尽
    【新华社上海九日电】宋庆龄先生七月七日在上海市各界纪念七七庆祝解放大会的演辞全文如下：在中国的历史上，帝国主义的侵略是一个数见不鲜的事件，“七七”便标记着中国人民所遭受的侵略之一。但“七七”却又是一个具有特别意义的日子。因为一九三七年日本军阀对我们生命财产的血腥的侵犯，也改变了那一时期的整个国际阵线的面目。我相信每一个在这儿的人，都会记得日本军阀曾经怎样夸口说：中国军队不能抵抗三个月。然而每一个人却也知道，尽管敌人疯狂的轰炸和海军用大炮来掩护进攻，只是在上海，我们就曾经和敌人战斗了三个月。保卫未曾设防的上海，怎样会可能呢？对于这一问题的回答是：为了保卫我们的民族独立，每一个爱国的中国人民曾经准备了牺牲，这便形成了一个警告。必需承认：这一警告的重大意义正逐渐地加强，因为中国人民在今天已经处在一种更其不可征服的地位。在我们悠久的历史上，我们第一次有了真正的人民的军队，在他们的后面是我们全体人民的力量。此外，我们为了民族独立与自由所进行的英勇斗争和取得的胜利，已经动摇了帝国主义者在中国、在亚洲统治的基础，他们的劳力正在崩溃中。因此，我们向企图阻止我们巨大的民主浪潮的帝国主义者提出严重警告，我们向虚妄地制造国际战争烟幕并且威胁人民民主力量的和平愿望的反动派提出严重警告：滚开吧！否则你们将同归于尽。在今年“七七”，我们中国人民很有自信地瞻望我们国家的一个光荣的未来，在那时，人民的民族主义、民权主义和民生主义将要一并地辉煌地实现。我们也预见了我们伟大的人民和伟大的国家的幸福。中国人民民主共和国万岁！
