　　Important Correction
    Regarding the article "America Protects the Revival of Japanese Aggressive Forces" broadcast on the 5th (published on page 1 of this newspaper on the 6th), the second paragraph, namely the section "Employing Japanese Aggressive Forces," from "Shigeru Yoshida himself" to "continue to ride on the heads of the Japanese people, acting like tyrants and bullies," due to a factual error arising from mistaking one Yoshida Shigeru for another, please delete it entirely and replace it with: "Shigeru Yoshida himself came from a family of diplomatic bureaucrats, and served as the Japanese Consul-General in Shenyang and the Ambassador to Italy, actively supporting Japan's war of aggression."

　　重要更正
    五日播发“美国保护日本侵略势力复活”一文（刊本报六日一版）第二段即“起用日本侵略势力”一段中，自“吉田茂本人”起，至“照旧骑在日本人民的头上，作威作福。”止，因日本有两个吉田茂，而本文材料引用错误，请全部删去，并改为：“吉田茂本人出身于外交官僚，曾任日本驻沈阳总领事，驻意大使等职，积极支持过日本的侵略战争。”
