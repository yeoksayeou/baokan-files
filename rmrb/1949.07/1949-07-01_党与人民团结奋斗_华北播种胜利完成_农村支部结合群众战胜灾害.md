　　The Party and the People Unite and Struggle
    Spring Sowing Victoriously Completed in North China
    Rural Branches Unite with the Masses to Overcome Disasters
    [This newspaper reports] The Party branches and Party committees at all levels in rural areas of North China, with the combat posture of the vanguard, actively united the masses and overcame various disasters in this year's large-scale production movement across the region, ensuring the complete realization of the sowing plan. The first difficulty encountered in this year's sowing plan was the lack of guarantee for achieving the plan to increase cotton and peanut planting. Because the peasants did not immediately realize how much benefit planting cotton would bring them, they arranged their sowing plan according to their old habits, based on self-sufficiency, worrying that "if cotton is planted everywhere, the price of cotton will be cheap," and fearing that it "cannot be exchanged for grain" and "the livestock will have no grass to eat." Party committees and rural Party members in various places, in response to these concerns of the masses, explained to the masses the government's decrees and measures for rewarding cotton planting on the one hand, and solved the various practical difficulties encountered by the masses in planting cotton on the other. Party members of the Nan Si Gu branch in Guangping County selected typical households that benefited from cotton planting last year to publicize to the masses, and mobilized these typical households to calculate accounts for the masses. The Xi Wang Village branch in Jin County divided all Party members into seven groups to carry out door-to-door propaganda, carefully guiding and resolving every subtle concern of the masses. The branch coordinated with the village government to calculate the amount of seeds lacking in the village, and uniformly went to the county's promotion cooperatives or sent people to other counties to exchange for them. During the cotton planting season from the Beginning of Summer to the Grain Full, there was a severe drought without rain. Party members took the lead in uniting the masses to help each other dig wells and repair waterwheels. When the masses showed doubts and lack of confidence, such as the Baodi County Committee immediately calling on Party members: "Whether or not we can overcome the drought depends on the leadership of the branch." In the Fifth District, 300 new wells were dug in just over ten days, and 8,000 mu of the 9,000 mu cotton field plan was immediately completed.
    In some areas of Taihang, Taiyue, and Jinzhong, wheat suffered from frost and hail damage this spring. The masses began to sigh and complain. The Party branches and Party committees in these areas actively led the masses in replanting flowers and other crops. This year, most counties in the region encountered natural disasters such as drought, insects, and hail. Party committees and branches in various places guaranteed increased production with the determination to actively overcome difficulties. The Jinnan District Committee and the Third Prefectural Committee criticized the fact that locust plagues had partially spread due to cadres returning home for the wheat harvest, and immediately mobilized and organized manpower day and night to fight them. 320,000 men, women, and children participated in this movement, and the insect plague was basically eliminated in ten days.
  　Carry Out Criticism and Self-Criticism, Improve Leadership
    In the leadership of the production movement, many branches carried out criticism and self-criticism to improve leadership. Chang Sanmao, the secretary of the Ping Shun County Committee in Taihang, personally led the Han Jia Village branch to discuss how to lead the masses in topdressing wheat. He changed the branch's leadership approach of only seeking to complete tasks without combining with the demands of the masses to improve the masses, and first made Party members understand ideologically that hoeing wheat and topdressing is not simply a requirement from above, but is beneficial and necessary for Party members and the masses themselves. On this ideological basis, they helped Party members specifically study how to solve difficulties in the process, such as where to find fertilizer sources and how to organize manpower, thereby advancing the connection between the Party and the masses and completing the plan for hoeing wheat and topdressing. In leading production, there are still a few branches and Party members who still have a coercive and commanding style in their relationship with the masses. The Secretary of the Chicheng County Committee, in his inspection, believed that the main reason for administrative orders was that the leadership arranged more and checked less, asked for more achievements from below and thought of fewer ways to solve problems, and criticized more and encouraged less. After inspection, a method of correction was determined. The Taihang District Party Committee Office proposed: "The leadership of the county should go deep into the villages." Pay attention to "leading production with production," strengthen leadership, give full play to the strength of the masses, and ensure the completion of the task of increasing production.

　　党与人民团结奋斗
    华北播种胜利完成
    农村支部结合群众战胜灾害
    【本报讯】华北各地农村党的支部、各级党委，在今年全区性的大规模生产运动中，以先锋队的战斗姿态，积极团结群众，战胜了各种灾害，保证了播种计划的全部实现。今年播种计划中所遇到的第一个困难是实现增种棉花、花生的计划无保证。由于农民一时还想不到种棉花对于他们有多大利益，他们是按照自己的老习惯，从自种自下自用上来安排自己的播种计划的，他们顾虑：“普天盖地种棉花，花要贱。”担心“换不来粮食”，“牲口没草吃”等。各地党委和农村党员，对于群众的这些反映，一方面以人民政府奖励植棉的法令、办法向群众做解释，另一方面解决群众在种棉中所遇到的各种实际困难。广平县南寺固有支部党员，选出去年种棉得益的典型户向群众宣传，并动员这些典型户给群众算帐。晋县西旺村支部把全体党员分成七片，挨户宣传，对于群众的每一细微顾虑都仔细地加以引导与解决。支部协同村政权计算本村所缺的种籽，统一经县的推进社或派人到外县去换。从立夏到小满的种花季节里，苦旱不雨，党员带头，团结群众，互助挖井、修水车；群众表现疑虑与缺乏信心的时候，如宝坻县委即号召党员：“能否战胜天旱，决定于支部的领导力量。”五区在短短的十数日内挖好新井三百眼，九千亩棉田计划立即完成了八千亩。
    太行、太岳、晋中等地的部分地区，今春麦子遭受冻灾与雹灾，群众开始在唉声叹气，这些地区的党的支部与党委，即积极的领导了群众的改花补种工作。今年全区多数县份都遇到了旱、虫、雹等自然灾害，各地党委与支部以积极战胜困难的决心，保证增产。冀南区党委与三地委对于因麦收干部回家而致蝗灾部分蔓延的事实做了批评，并立即星夜动员与组织人力扑打，三十二万男女老幼参加了这一运动，虫害在十数天内得以基本消灭。
  　开展批评与自我批评，改进领导
    在生产运动的领导中，不少支部开展了批评与自我批评，改进了领导。太行平顺县委常三毛，亲自领导韩家村支部讨论如何领导群众上追肥的办法，他改变了支部领导上的只求完成任务不结合群众要求去提高群众的观点，首先从思想上让党员明白锄麦上追肥不简单是一个上级的要求，而是对党员对群众自己都是有利的与必要的。在这一思想基础上，去帮助党员具体研究如何解决进行中困难，如从那里去找肥料的来源及如何组织人力等，从而使党与群众联系前进了一步，并完成了锄麦上追肥的计划。在领导生产中还有少数支部和党员在与群众关系上，仍存在着强迫命令的作风，赤城县委书记在检查中，认为行政命令发生的主要原因是领导上多布置少检查，向下多要成绩而少想办法，批评多而鼓励少所致。经过检查定出改正的办法。太行区党委办公室提出的是：“县的领导深入到村”。注意“以生产领导生产”加强领导，发挥群众力量，保证增产任务的完成。
