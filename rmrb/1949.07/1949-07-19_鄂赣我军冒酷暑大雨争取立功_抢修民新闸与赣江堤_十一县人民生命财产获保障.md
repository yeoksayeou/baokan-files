Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 18th: A certain unit of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army has successfully repaired the Minxin Sluice Gate near Fankou Town in Echeng, Hubei, safeguarding the lives and property of the people in seven counties. The Minxin Sluice Gate is located eight miles west of Echeng County and is one of the five major projects on the Yangtze River. The people of Echeng, Daye, Wuchang, Tongshan, Yangxin, and Huanggang counties all rely on this gate to draw water from the river to irrigate their fields. During the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the Minxin Sluice Gate was once damaged by the Kuomintang army. With the rising waters of the Yangtze River, the long-neglected Minxin Sluice Gate was in imminent danger. Waves inside the dike were surging and impacting the dike's banks, and the mud on the west side of the dike was being severely eroded by the river water. The People's Liberation Army stationed in the area promptly organized a repair team of more than 750 people to carry out emergency repairs. The soldiers, enduring the intense heat, transported stones along rugged mountain roads, working from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day, completing the repairs in just one week. In seven days, the dike repair troops transported 786 cubic meters of stones, each cubic meter weighing approximately 12,000 jin (6,000 kg), totaling approximately 10 million jin (5,000 metric tons), and repaired 150 meters of the dike. At the celebration meeting for the successful repair of the dangerous dike, people's representatives from the seven local counties came to participate and presented the dike repair troops with six banners, including "Meritorious Service to Seven Counties" and "Dike Repair as High as the Mountains," expressing their gratitude to the People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 18th: The People's Liberation Army stationed on the east bank of the Gan River braved the rain to repair the river dike between Zhangshu and Yongtai, ensuring the safety of the lives of millions of people in Qingjiang, Fengcheng, Jinxian, and Nanchang counties. On the night of June 12th, due to heavy rains upstream, the Gan River's floodwaters violently impacted the river dike, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Soldiers of the 15th Detachment, who were guarding the Yangzhuang River Dike day and night, discovered a spot on the dike where water was seeping through. After receiving the alert, the guard company immediately convened an emergency meeting. Because they could not find sacks to hold the soil, the soldiers suggested, "As long as we block the water and prevent it from flooding the people's rice fields, everyone should donate their quilts." This suggestion was immediately met with enthusiastic response from everyone. They immediately wrapped their quilts around soil and blocked the dangerous cracks. On the 13th and 14th, the rising river water continued to violently wash against the dike, and a torrent broke through the dike, washing away newly driven wooden stakes. In the face of the flood, the villagers participating in the dike reinforcement scattered and fled. Guo Zhenwang, the platoon leader of the Second Platoon of a certain company, mobilized and explained to the villagers, while directing everyone to rush to repair the dike. At this time, it was raining heavily, and the soldiers repairing the dike could hardly open their eyes because of the rain, but everyone worked harder. The soldiers put forward the slogan "Not afraid of rain, not stopping work, repairing the river dike to make great contributions." The people repairing in the rain were covered in mud and water, but they all said, "Clothes can get wet and dry, get dirty and be washed, but if the dike is not repaired well, the people of the four counties will suffer." With the joint efforts of the People's Liberation Army and the local people, four or five breaches in Yangzhuang and Tianzhuang were finally completely blocked, saving millions of mu of fertile land and the lives and property of millions of people in Qingjiang and other four counties from being swallowed by the flood.

    鄂赣我军冒酷暑大雨争取立功
    抢修民新闸与赣江堤
    十一县人民生命财产获保障
    【新华社汉口十八日电】人民解放军第四野战军某部，抢修好了湖北鄂城附近樊口镇的民新闸，使七县人民的生命财产获得保障。民新闸在鄂城县以西八里，是长江的五大工程之一。鄂城、大冶、武昌、通山、阳新、黄冈等七县人民，都依靠此闸引进江水，灌溉田地。该闸在民国二十七年间，曾遭国民党军队一度破坏，当此长江水涨之时，年久失修的民新闸，岌岌可危。堤内波浪翻天，冲击堤岸，西边堤面的泥地被江水冲刷侵蚀，非常厉害。驻防该地的解放军，及时地组织了七百五十余人的抢修队，进行紧急抢修。战士们在炎天暑热下，由崎岖的山道搬运石块，每天从早八点钟起，一直干到下午五点钟，仅以一星期的时间，便抢修成功了。七天来修堤部队共搬运石块七百八十六方，每石方约为一万二千斤，合计约一千万斤，补修堤岸一百五十公尺。在庆祝险堤抢修成功的大会上，当地七个县的人民代表都赶来参加，赠给修堤部队“功在七县”、“修堤功高如山”等六面锦旗，表示对解放军的感激。
    【新华社浙赣前线十八日电】驻防赣江东岸的人民解放军，冒雨抢修由樟树到永泰之间的江堤，保障了清江、丰城、进贤、南昌四县百万人民的生命安全。六月十二日夜，因上游大雨，赣江大水猛烈冲击江堤，情势危险万分。日夜守望杨庄江堤的十五支队哨兵，发现堤上一处已在冒水。警卫连得到警报后，立即召集紧急会议。因为找不着盛土的麻袋，战士们就提议：“只要堵住水，冲不了老百姓的稻田，大家把被子捐出来”。这个意见马上获得全体热烈的响应，大家立即将自己的被子包上土，堵住了危险的裂口。十三、十四两日，上涨的江水，仍不断猛烈地洗刷着堤岸，一股巨流破堤而出，新打的木桩冲倒了。在洪水的前面，参加抢堤的老乡们四散奔避了。某连二排排长郭振旺，一面向老乡们动员解说，一面指挥大家抢修。此时正值大雨如注，抢修堤岸的战士眼睛都被雨打得睁不开，但大家越干越有劲。战士们提出“不怕雨，不停工，修复江堤立大功”的口号。在雨中抢修的人们，浑身泥水，但是他们都说：“衣服湿了能干，脏了能洗，堤要修不好，四县人民就遭难了。”在解放军与当地人民合力抢修下，杨庄和田庄四五处决口，终于完全堵住，使清江等四县千万亩良田和百万人民的生命财产，得免洪水的吞没。
