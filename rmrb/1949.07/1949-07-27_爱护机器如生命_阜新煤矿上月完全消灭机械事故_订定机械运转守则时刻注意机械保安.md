　　"Cherish machines like life"
  　Fuxin Coal Mine completely eliminated mechanical accidents last month.
    Formulated mechanical operation rules to always pay attention to mechanical safety.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th] It is very difficult to ensure that a mine producing 7,000 tons of coal per day does not experience any mechanical accidents within a month, but the Fuxin Coal Mine in Northeast China has achieved this. The Fuxin Coal Mine's serious implementation of mechanical safety work only began in February of this year. At that time, the mine had experienced three major mechanical accidents, the most serious of which was the complete burning of a 150-horsepower electric roller coil, with losses in labor and materials valued at approximately 20 million Northeast currency. If the total value of the three accidents was allocated to the month's coal production, it would have increased the cost of each ton of coal by 600 yuan. These events aroused serious vigilance among the mine's leadership. Therefore, in early March, a Mechanical and Electrical Safety Committee was first established, and a joint internal mine mechanical and electrical safety inspection was conducted. The Mining Bureau's Mechanical and Electrical Section organized mechanical and electrical engineers and experienced veteran workers to comprehensively inspect the installation and operation of all mechanical and electrical equipment, correcting all non-compliant phenomena. After summarizing the inspection results, a "Mechanical Operation Code" was drafted and promulgated throughout the mine after being reviewed by the Mining Bureau. The main parts of the code are as follows: 1. Do not leave your post without permission when the machine is running. 2. If an abnormal operating condition is found, stop the machine immediately and report it urgently. 3. Everyone should be fully responsible for the machine they operate, and no one is allowed to enter the room or tamper with the machine without the permission of the competent superior. 4. The person operating the machine shall be responsible for the inspection, repair, and cleaning of the machine to ensure that it is always clean. 5. When the machine is running, attention must be paid to its sound, temperature, odor, and various calculation devices, and one must not read books or do other things. 6. When changing shifts, the on-duty personnel must check whether there are any abnormalities in each part of the machine, the cleanliness of the machine and the room, and must inquire about the operation of the day, and never take over the shift carelessly. 7. Without the permission of the competent superior, the machine must never be allowed to exceed its load or normal speed. In order to arouse sufficient attention from all units, the mine convened 21 mechanical and electrical personnel in charge of various units in April to establish a mechanical and electrical safety training class, explaining the importance of mechanical and electrical equipment in enterprise departments. After exchanging experiences in operating various mechanical and electrical equipment, collective wisdom was used to formulate precautions for electrical aspects, mechanical aspects, winch operators, fan operators, coal loading machine and electric drill operators, as well as operating methods for various machines, which were widely distributed. Strict reward and punishment regulations for mechanical and electrical safety, as well as the inspection system of the unit, were established, making mechanical safety work a mass movement. The General Machinery Plant numbered the machines according to the workshop to distinguish each person's responsibilities. Every machine was so clean that there was not a speck of dust, and slogans such as "Cherish machines like life" and "Always pay attention to machine safety" were hung everywhere. In addition to learning and complying with the "Mechanical Operation Code" issued by the Mining Bureau, each mine and factory formulated "Mechanical Safety Conventions" according to their specific circumstances to draw the attention of non-mechanical personnel at any time. The actual effect of this movement was great. Only four minor accidents occurred in March and April, which were reduced to two in May, and completely eliminated in June. However, all the mine's employees are not satisfied with this. They proposed that in the future, in addition to strengthening safety work in a more planned manner, they should also study how to improve operating efficiency and the consumption quota of various oils, so as to gradually achieve the highest possible improvement in operating efficiency and reduce machine consumption.

　　“爱护机器如生命”
  　阜新煤矿上月完全消灭机械事故
    订定机械运转守则时刻注意机械保安
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】要想使一个日产七千吨煤的矿山的机械，在一个月之内不发生任何事故，这是很不容易的事情，东北阜新煤矿却做到了这一点。阜新煤矿对于机械保安工作的认真执行，是今年二月间才开始的。当时该矿机械曾经发生过三次大事故，最严重的一次是把一百五十马力的电滚线包完全烧坏了，连工带料损失约值东北币二千万元。如果把三次事故损失的总值分配到该月的煤产量上，便使每吨煤加重了六百元的成本。这些事件，引起了该矿领导上的严重警惕。于是在三月初，首先成立了机电保安委员会，进行了一次内矿性质的机电保安联合大检查，由矿务局机电科组织机电工程师和有经验的老工友，普遍检查了所有机械电气的安装及运转情形，纠正了一切不合规则的现象，在总结了检查结果之后，编写了一份“机械运转守则”，经矿务局审查后，通令全矿实行。该守则之主要部分如下：一、机械开动时不得擅离职守。二、发现运转状态异常时，立即停止运转，紧急报告。三、每个人应对自己操纵的机器负完全责任，非经主管上级许可，不许他人入室或乱动机器。四、操纵机械的人应负责机械的检查及修缮、擦拭，以保证其经常整洁。五、在机器运转时，必须随时注意其音响、温度、气味以及各种计算的设备，不得看书和做其他事情。六、换班时，上班人员必须检查机器各部有无异状，机器及室内清洁如何，并须问明当日之运转情况等，决不马虎接班。七、非经主管上级许可，绝不许机器超过负荷量或正常速度。该矿为引起各单位之足够重视，四月间该矿又召集各单位负责机电人员二十一名，成立机电保安讲习班，讲解机电在企业部门中的重要性，并在交流操纵各种机电的经验后，发挥集体智慧，拟定了电气方面、机械方面、绞车运转手、扇风机运转手、载煤机及电钻运转手之注意事项及各种机械之操纵方法，普遍印发下去，并严格定出机电保安之奖惩条例，以及本单位的检查制度等，从此使机械保安工作，成了群众性的运动。总机厂把机器按车间编号，以区分每人职责，每一台机器都干净得没有一星灰尘，到处都悬挂着“爱护机器如生命”“时时刻刻注意机器保安”的标语。各矿、厂除去学习并遵守矿务局发下之“机械运转守则”外，各单位又根据具体情况，拟定“机械保安公约”，以随时引起非机械人员之注意。这一运动开展后收获的实际效果很大，三、四月份只发生了四次轻微事故，五月份就减为两次，六月份就完全消灭了。但全矿职工并不以此为满足，他们提出今后除更有计划地加强保安工作外，还要研究如何提高运转效能以及各种油类的消耗定量等等，以期逐步做到最高限度的提高运转效率，减低机器消耗。
