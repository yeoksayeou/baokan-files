　　Our Mute
    Liu Songtao
    People who have worked in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region government in the past all know Mute Gao. When everyone talks about him, they always say, "How is our Mute doing?" Some comrades, even after being away from the Border Region government for several years, often ask if Mute is still around when they occasionally return. Mute was a cook in the kitchen crew, of medium height, in his thirties, with a long, thin face, and always wore that unnatural, shy-like smile. There was nothing particularly remarkable about him. The reason he was so famous and cared about by everyone was this: During the war against Japan, the rear area organs of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region lived in the mountain gullies around Fuping and Lingshou for seven or eight years. They ate mostly millet year-round. The millet produced in this area was very unpleasant, with a lot of sand. There was a local saying: "Fuping and Xingtang, eat a city wall in a year." Many comrades in the organs considered eating sandy rice a hardship. But the kitchen crew of the Border Region government was very different because Mute was good at washing rice, and there was never any sand in the rice. Sometimes, if sand was found in a meal, the comrades would assume that Mute was doing other work or was sick. This is how Mute became famous.
    But Mute had a strange temper. Anyone who showed him contempt would immediately make him raise his nose, pull his face down, and give you a hard time, even shouting "Ah, ah" loudly. For example, one time in Lingshou, there was a guest in a long gown in the reception room. During the meal, he accidentally broke a stool leg, almost spilling his food on himself. Just then, Mute came in with the dishes, and the guest in the long gown threw his chopsticks and slammed the table, complaining that Mute was irresponsible and shouldn't have put a broken stool there. His attitude was like that of an owner scolding his servant. Mute's face darkened, and he immediately started arguing loudly with the guest in the long gown, "Ah, ah." The head cook Lao Li came in to pull him away, but he wouldn't budge. He pointed at the guest with his hand, then pointed at the stool, then pointed at the guest and himself, then pointed outwards with both hands, and then angrily waved his hand and started shouting "Ah, ah." No one knew what he meant. The head cook Lao Li came out to translate, saying: "Mute pointed at the stool and then at the person, meaning that he broke the stool himself, so why is he acting up with others? He pointed at the guest and himself, and then pointed outwards, meaning that we are all working to fight against Japan. Our jobs are different, but people are equal. Why are you deliberately bullying people!..." After this explanation, the guest quietly stopped talking.
    Mute had a strong sense of responsibility. He was meticulous in his work and didn't want to be criticized. For example, some mischievous "little devils" would deliberately tease Mute in the dining hall. When he came to add food, they would pretend that they had bitten on sand and felt very uncomfortable. They would point with their fingers and pull something out of their mouths for everyone to see, indicating that the rice wasn't washed clean. When Mute saw this, he felt that it was a great insult to his work. He would immediately shout "Ah, ah" and chase after the "little devil," making them run around and scream.
    Perhaps because Mute was used to a poor life, he was very fond of public property. When he found someone had poured leftover rice or noodles into the slop bucket, he would often pull the manager to go and see, asking him to find out who did it. Some comrades who often left leftovers in their bowls would force themselves to eat or give it to other comrades when they saw Mute coming, because they were afraid of being seen by Mute and making him shout "Ah, ah." Once, in the spring of 1942, the Border Region government was stationed in Qilin Yuan Village, Lingshou County. At that time, the enemy had just completed the second blockade line in western Hebei, and the spring famine was very severe. The lives of the common people were very hard. Each of the government's staff members could only eat three cornmeal buns and a little bit of vegetables for a normal meal. One day, I forgot what holiday it was, there was a communal meal, and people who hadn't had meat in a long time ate heartily. Just after the meal, Mute started shouting "Ah, ah" in the dining hall. Many people ran over to see what was happening. They saw Mute holding a small newspaper package and walking out. The head cook Lao Bai stopped him from leaving. A lot of comrades who had just finished eating gathered at the door to watch the excitement. Mute's face turned pale. He pointed to his head with his hand, then touched downwards, and then angrily showed everyone what was in the newspaper. A few pieces of pork skin fell out of the small newspaper package. People couldn't figure out what was going on. Fortunately, the head cook Lao Bai acted as a "translator" for everyone. It turned out that two new female comrades who had come from the enemy-occupied area and wore small braids were too picky about eating meat and thought the pork skin didn't taste good, so they threw it on the ground. Mute felt that it was too wasteful to waste things like that. He picked up the pork skin and insisted on taking it to Chief Wang of the General Affairs Section. Because the two female comrades lived in the reception room in the courtyard of the General Affairs Section, Lao Bai firmly stopped him from going. Mute pointed to his head with both hands, indicating the two small braids. Later, after several comrades made gestures for a while, Mute went back to washing dishes.
    In the autumn of 1943, the unprecedentedly cruel autumn "mopping-up" operation began. The troops almost all transferred to the outer lines, and the "old and weak" of the Border Region government were hidden in the homes of the villagers nearby. Most of the working comrades were also assigned to the border areas to help with local work. Only a few responsible leaders, with a small group of stronger comrades and some guards, about fifty people, formed a small and capable team. This became the leadership core for protecting the Border Region government at that time. From the first day of departure, Mute had been carrying the oil bucket and the salt bag, closely following behind the team. Every day, they played hide-and-seek with the enemy in the designated mountain gullies. Every midnight, when the Big Dipper had just emerged on the eastern mountain, the team had already eaten and transferred along the dark mountain gullies. Near dawn, they would stop at the campsite for a short rest, and then set up a radio station in a secluded place to contact the administrative offices. Generally, the comrades would use stones or their knees as tables to reply to the telegrams from various places or the official documents transferred by the transportation station. Comrades who were not busy would help the keepers and cooks to cut grass, chop straw, grind rice, find pots, and watch houses... At that time, the most difficult task to complete was finding a large pot for cooking, because there were few people in the mountain gullies, and there were very few large pots that could cook for forty or fifty people. Many "mopping-up" operations had been smashed by the Japanese devils. It was also often difficult to find people in the villages. Sometimes, after living in the village for four or five hours, they still couldn't find a cooking pot. Several times, when everyone was helpless, they saw Mute carrying a large pot from a mountain path, because every time he arrived at the campsite, he put down his burden and immediately went to complete this task. Sometimes, he even ran seven or eight miles. The comrade in charge of the team publicly gave him a thumbs up to praise him several times.
    The situation became increasingly tense. The enemy built an airport in the rice fields of Fahua Village, west of Fuping City, a temporary stronghold. Every day, two planes would come back and forth to scout along the mountain gullies. Later, even the smoke from the chimneys became a target for bombing. That morning, this small team stayed at Gaojiazhuang, the northernmost part of Fuping County. Everyone opened their bedding and just lay down when suddenly the plane had already flown over the village. People were used to it and didn't care. Who knew that because a few mules of a public store were tied to the threshing ground, they exposed the target. After circling halfway, the bombs were dropped. Because the village was very small, people quickly left the village, followed by five bombs in a row. A bomb landed right on the door of the temporary kitchen. The cook Zhang Kaisheng was bombed to death. In addition, a communications worker named Zhen and two villagers also died. But Mute still insisted on cooking. When everyone returned to the village after the plane left, Mute had already prepared the meal. He was alone moving Zhang Kaisheng's body onto the door panel, with tears in his eyes and a few patches of blood on his white apron. Because Mute couldn't hear the plane, fearing more trouble, the leaders decided to temporarily "fortify" him in the home of a villager and let him rest, but Mute firmly refused and continued to work under the strafing and bombing of the planes. Later, in order to avoid losses, the comrades all moved to a mountain gully far from the village to work. He and the manager Lao Geng would make food in the village every day and carry it in pots to the mountain gully for the comrades to eat. This continued until the victory against the "mopping-up" operation.
    In the autumn of 1944, at the Border Region government's conference to elect heroes and models, Mute was elected as the working hero of the entire organ with 97% of the votes. When he wore a large red flower and walked to the rostrum amidst applause, he blushed and said "Ah, ah" a few times, first sticking out his little finger, and then sticking out his thumb. The manager Lao Geng, who came from a working-class background, understood Mute's words best. He said with a smile: "Mute is telling everyone that in the old society, people like us were worthless and were 'grandchildren' everywhere! But in the new society, we have become masters and respected heroes and models."
    Because Mute had to participate in the Border Region-level mass heroes meeting, it was necessary to write out their biography, which made many people suffer, because Mute came to the Border Region government very early, and no one knew much about his origins. Gestures were useless. After asking all the comrades in the General Affairs Section, no one knew. Fortunately, an old comrade from the Border Region High Court provided some of the following materials:
    In the spring of 1939, the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region government had just been established in Fuping. Because of the enemy's nine-route encirclement, the Border Region government moved to Tailu Temple under Mount Wutai. The government's guard team rescued three villagers from the enemy's stronghold, but it was unknown where they came from. One of them was Mute. The other two made it clear their home address and were sent back along the village. But Mute couldn't say his home address, and the situation was urgent. Everyone was afraid that he would be captured by the enemy again, so they kept him following the government. Later, they asked him to help with cooking in the kitchen. Over time, the government moved many places, and his hometown became even more difficult to trace.
    After interviewing several guard comrades, they had argued about this matter: Some said that Mute was very good at farming, and at that time, a part of the guard team had lived in the Dangcheng area of ​​Quyang and often operated near Quyang City, so Mute may be a farmer near Quyang City. But another comrade refuted his statement, saying that the brigade headquarters had lived in the south of Mount Wutai for a long time and often operated near Yangqu. Mute was very strong, so it was concluded that he was a coal miner near Yangqu. Quyang people or Yangqu people? Farmers or coal miners, they tangled for a long time, but still couldn't figure it out. There was no way, so at the time, they had to write "Quyang people or Yangqu people" in the "Hero Biography". The surname of Mute was also impossible to trace. In the personnel registration form of the General Affairs Section, it was written "Gao Mute," but no one knew on what basis. Therefore, they had to write: "Everyone calls him Gao Mute, but there is no proof. ..."
    The cook Lao Qian of the small kitchen was getting married. Many comrades in the entire government sent gifts, and the leaders personally accompanied the newlyweds for the wedding banquet. At the wedding ceremony, everyone specially asked the working hero of the entire organ to speak. Comrade Gao Mute was pushed to the rostrum. After he happily said "Ah, ah" for a while, he touched his earrings with his hand, and then gestured by touching the small braid behind his head, and also compared three times with his hand horizontally. Everyone was confused, and after a burst of applause, they pushed out the translator Lao Geng, who understood Mute's gestures best. Lao Geng said with a smile: "Mute is very happy to see Lao Qian get married, but he also misses his family. He touches his earrings and braid to talk about the women in his family, and compares three times with his hand to say that the children are taller than each other…" It was impossible to judge whether the woman was his mother or his wife, or what his children were.
    In the autumn of 1945, the Japanese devils surrendered. Mute and many comrades of the Border Region government carried their bedding and entered Zhangjiakou. Because many areas were liberated, many people who had not returned home for many years had been in touch with their families. One day, the Secretary-General specially mentioned at a meeting that Mute, who had not returned home for eight years, should be allowed to go home and see, and he was specially granted three months of leave. But where was Mute from? The comrades argued again. Finally, a comrade familiar with the situation in Quyang City found a more reliable basis. The reason was that the Gao family in Quyang City was a big family, so it was concluded that he was from Quyang City.
    This was decided like that. The Secretariat gave him an extra portion of travel expenses, and Mute himself took out the money he had saved in the organ's cooperative over the years by participating in agricultural production, and bought some cloth and daily necessities. The comrades in the kitchen also pooled some money for him, and the General Affairs Section specially sent a person to send him off with a mare. Mute went home like this.
    But in less than half a month, that unnatural, shy-like smiling face appeared in the dining hall again. But it was a little darker. Later, it was learned that Mute had lived in Quyang City for three or four days and walked all over those small streets. Not only did he not find his family, but he didn't even find the house. There was no way, so he had to return the way he came.

　　我们的哑叭
    刘松涛
    过去在晋察冀边区政府工作过的人，没有不认识高哑叭的。大家一谈起来，总是说咱们哑叭怎样怎样，有的同志，离开边区政府好几年，偶而回来的时候，也常常打问哑叭还在不在。哑叭是大伙房的炊事员，中流个，三十多岁，长瘦脸，整年价那么不自然的害臊似的微笑着。没有什么引人注意的地方，他之所以这样出名，被大家关心，原因是这样的：打日本的时候，晋察冀边区一级的后方机关，七八年的时间，都是住在阜平灵寿一带的山沟里，一年三百六十日，吃的大半都是小米，这地方，出产的小米很讨厌，沙子特别多，当地人有句俗话：“阜平行唐，一年吃座城墙”。好多机关的同志，都把吃有沙子的饭，当成一件苦事。可是只有边区政府的伙房里，大不一样，因为哑叭淘米淘得好，饭里从来就没有沙子，有时偶而一顿饭里发现了沙子，同志们就会断定哑叭去搞别的工作或是生了病，这样使得哑叭有了名。
    可是哑叭这个人，有个怪脾气，不管是谁，只要对他露出看不起他的样子，他会马上把鼻子一翘，脸往下一沉，给你一个难看，甚至“啊啊”的大吵一顿，比如那一年在灵寿有一次，招待室里来了一位穿长袍的客人，吃饭的时候，因为自己不小心，把一个凳子腿坐折了，几乎把饭洒在身上，恰好这工夫，哑叭端菜进来，这位长袍客竟对他摔筷子拍桌子的发起火来，嫌哑叭不负责任，不该把不牢固的破凳子放在这里，那态度很象东家斥责他的下人一样。哑叭的脸沉下来了，马上大声“啊啊”着跟这位长袍客人吵起来。炊事班长老李进来拉也拉不走，他用手把那客人指了下，又指指凳子，接着又把客人和他自己指了一下，后两手向外一指，又猛的把手一甩，就很生气的啊啊起来。别人都不知道是什么意思，炊事班长老李出来翻译，他说：“哑吧指了凳子又指人，这是说凳子是他自己坐坏的，为什么还跟别人耍态度，他指客人和自己，又向外指，是说我们大家都是干抗日工作的，工作不一样，人可是平等的，你为什么故意训唬人！……”这一说，那个客人才悄悄的不言语了。
    哑叭的责任心很强，他搞工作细致，不愿让人挑眼子。比如有些挑皮的“小鬼”，在饭厅里，故意跟哑叭逗着玩，等他添菜来的时候，装出牙齿咬了沙子很难受的样子，一面用手指从嘴里捏出一点什么东西给大家看，说明淘的米不干净，哑叭看了觉得对他的工作是一个很大的侮辱，马上就“啊啊”的叫着，去追上那个“小鬼”，让他找出沙子来，常常把“小鬼”们追得唧唧喳喳的乱跑乱叫。
    哑叭也许是过惯了穷光景的缘故，对公家的东西非常疼爱，他发现泔水缸里有人倒了剩饭或面条的时候，常常拉着管理员去看，叫他查出是谁倒的。有些吃饭好剩碗底的同志，一看哑叭过来，总是勉强吃了或是倒给别的同志，谁也怕给哑叭看见了惹得他“啊啊”的叫。有一次，是一九四二年春天，边区政府住在灵寿县祁林院村上，那工夫，敌人刚完成了冀西的第二道封锁沟，春荒很严重，老百姓生活都非常苦，每府的工作人员，平常政顿饭只能吃上三个玉茭面窝窝头和很少一点菜。一天，我忘记了是过什么节日，全体会餐，好久沾不到腥气的人们，吃得好不痛快。刚吃罢饭，哑叭就在饭厅里“啊啊”的嚷起来，许多人都跑过来看看，见哑叭正拿了一个小报纸包，往外走，炊事班的老白拦着不让他去，门口集了许多刚吃罢饭的同志在那里看热闹，哑叭的脸色变得很苍白，他用手向头上比划着，一边向下摸了一下，接着就气愤的把报纸里的东西给大家看，有几片猪肉皮从小报纸包里掉下来。人们都摸不清是怎么回事，亏得炊事班老白给大家当“翻译”，原来是两个新从敌占区来的留着两个小辫的女同志，吃肉太讲究，嫌肉皮不好吃，都丢在地上了，哑叭觉得这样糟踏东西太不应该，他把肉皮拾起来非让总务科王科长去看不可。因为那两位女同志就住在总务科院内的招待室里，所以老白坚决不让他去。哑叭用两手向头上比划，正是表示那两条小辫子呢。后来经过好几位同志打了一阵手势，哑叭才又洗碗去了。
    一九四三年空前残酷的秋季大“扫荡”开始了。部队差不多都转移到外线，边区政府的“老弱队”，都分别隐蔽在附近村上的老乡家里，大部份工作同志也都分配到边缘区去帮助地方工作。只有几位负责的首长，带了一小部分身体较强的同志，和些警卫人员，五十来人，组成了一支短小精悍的队伍，这便成了保卫当时边区政权的领导核心。从第一天出发，哑叭就一直担了油桶和盐袋，紧紧跟在队伍的后面。天天在指定的几条山沟里和敌人捉迷藏。每天半夜，大明星刚在东山露头的工夫，队伍照例已经吃罢饭，顺着漆黑的山沟里转移了，将近黎明的时候，就在宿营地停下来，稍稍休息一下，便在僻静地方架起电台，和各行署专署来取联系。一般同志便把石头或膝盖当作桌子来答复各地的电报或由交通站转来的公文。工作不忙的同志，便帮着饲养员、炊事员割草、铡草、碾米、找锅、看房子……。当时最难完成的任务是找做饭用的大锅，因为山沟里人烟少，能作四五十个人饭的大锅很少，屡次“扫荡”又多半给鬼子砸了。村上又常常找不到人，有时在村上住下四五点钟，还寻不到一口做饭的大锅，有好几次正当大家没法的时候，见哑叭从山沟小道上背出一口大锅来，因为他每次一到宿营地，放下担子，马上去专门完成这个任务了。有时甚至跑出七八里地。负责带队的同志，有好几次当众伸出大拇指来表扬他。
    情况越来越紧了，敌人在临时的据点阜平城西法华村的稻田里修起飞机场，每天总有两架飞机，顺着一条条的山沟来往侦察，到后来，连烟筒冒烟，都成了轰炸的目标。那天早晨，这支小队伍在阜平县最北面的高家庄住下来，大家打开被包，才躺下来，忽然飞机已飞到村子上空了。人们习惯了，都不在意，那知因为一家公营商店的几匹骡拴在打谷场上，暴露了目标，转了半个圈子，炸弹就扔下来了。因为村子很小，人们很快就离开村子，接着一连丢了五个炸弹。一颗炸弹，正落在临时伙房的门上，炊事员张开生被炸死了，另外还死了一个姓甄的通讯员和两个老乡，但是哑叭仍坚持做饭，当飞机去后大家回村的时候，哑叭已经做好了饭，他一个人正在搬着张开生的尸体，往门扇上移，眼里含满了泪水，白围裙上染了几片鲜血。因为哑叭听不见飞机响，怕再出乱子，领导上决定把他暂时“坚壁”在老乡家里，让他休息休息，可是哑叭坚决拒绝了，照旧在飞机扫射轰炸下坚持工作。后来为了避免损失，同志们都搬到离村子很远的山沟里去办公，他就和管理员老耿每天在村上做好饭，用罐子担到山沟里来给同志们吃。这样一直坚持到反“扫荡”胜利。
    在一九四四年秋天，边区政府机关选举英雄模范的大会上，哑叭以百分之九十七的票数，当选了全机关的工作英雄，当他带了一朵大红花，在掌声里走到主席台上去的时候，他红着脸“啊啊”了几句，先伸出小手指来，接着又伸出了大拇指。长工出身的管理员老耿，是最了解哑叭的话的，他说：“哑叭这是告诉大家，在旧社会里，象我们这些人是一钱不值的，到那里都是‘孙子辈’！可是在新社会里却变成了主人，变成了人人尊敬的英雄模范了。”
    因为哑叭还要参加边区级机关的群英会，需要把他们的传记写出来，这可使得许多人遭了难，因为哑叭来边区政府很早，谁对他的来历也不大清楚，打手势又不中用，问遍了总务科里的同志，也没有一个了解的，幸亏边区高等法院的一位老同志供给了下面一些材料：
    那是一九三九年春天，晋察冀边区政府在阜平刚成立不久，因为敌人九路围攻，边区政府搬到了五台山下的台露寺里，政府的警卫队，不知道从接敌区的什么地方，在敌人的据点里，救出三个老乡，其中的一个就是哑叭。另外两个，说清楚了住址，都把他们沿村传送回去。可是哑叭说不出自己的家乡住址，情况又紧，大家怕他再被敌人俘去，就一直让他跟了政府行动，后来就叫他到伙房里帮忙做饭，日子久了，政府搬了许多地方，他的家乡更无从考查了。
    访问了几个警卫员同志，他们为这事曾引起了争辩：有的说，哑叭种地很内行，那时有一部份警卫队曾住在曲阳党城一带，常在曲阳城附近活动，因此哑叭可能是曲阳城附近的庄稼人。但另一位同志却反驳了他的说法说，大队部曾长时期住在五台南面，经常到阳曲附近活动，哑叭两手很有劲，因此断定他是阳曲附近挖煤的工人。曲阳人或阳曲人？庄稼人或煤矿工人，纠缠了半天，还是弄不清楚。没办法，当时只好在“英雄传”上写了“曲阳人或阳曲人”。关于哑叭的姓氏，也无从考查，在总务科的人员登记表上，写的是“高哑叭”，根据什么，谁也不知道。因此，只好这样写：“大家都叫他高哑叭，可是没有什么考证。…”
    小灶的炊事员老钱同志要结婚了，全政府的同志，好多都送了礼物，首长们还亲自陪一对新婚的老夫妇喝喜酒。在结婚典礼大会上，大家特别让全机关的工作英雄讲话，高哑叭同志被推上主席台，他高兴的“啊啊”了一阵之后，接着就用手摸了一下耳坠，又用手比划着摸了一下脑后的小辩子，还用手平着比了三下。大家摸不着头脑，一阵掌声，人们又把最懂哑叭手势的翻译老耿推了出来，老耿笑着说：“哑叭看到老钱结婚，心里很高兴，可是他也想起家来了，他用手摸耳坠和髻子是说他家的妇女，用手比了三下，是说一个比一个高的孩子，……”那妇女是说他的母亲，或是他的女人，小孩子又是他的什么人，谁也无法判断。
    一九四五年秋天，日本鬼子投降了，哑叭和边区政府的许多同志一块背了被包进了张家口，因为很多地区都解放了，多年没有回过家的人，都和家庭取上了联系。一天，秘书长在一次会议上，特别提出来要让八年来没有回过家的哑叭，去回家看看，特别准了他三个月的假。可是哑叭到底是那里人呢？同志们又争辩起来了。终于一位熟习曲阳城内情况的同志，找到了比较可靠的根据。理由是曲阳城内姓高的是大户，因此断定他是曲阳城里的人。
    就这样决定了，秘书处特别多给了他一部分旅费，哑叭自己更把历年来参加农业生产存在机关合作社里的钱也取出来，买了一点布头和日用的东西，伙房里的同志们也给凑了一点钱，又给他饯了行，总务科更专派了一个人带了一匹母骡去送他。哑叭就这样回家了。
    可是还不到半月，那张不自然的害臊似的笑脸又在饭厅里出现了。不过稍黑了些，后来才知道哑叭在曲阳城里住了三四天，走遍了那几条小街，不但没有找到家里的人，连房子也没找到，没办法，只好由原路回来了。
    一九四九、三、十一。于平山孟堡。
