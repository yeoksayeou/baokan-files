Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 21st: The Xinhua, Hengyuan, and Dasheng mills, three of the four major private cotton mills in Tianjin, have gradually adjusted their labor-management relations with the help of the People's Government and the Trade Union in the past six months, and production has returned to normal and achieved considerable development. The output of yarn and cloth from the three mills has recovered or exceeded the normal output of 1948 before the liberation of Tianjin. The other cotton mill, Beiyang, has lower production than before liberation due to poor management and long-standing unresolved issues such as wages and personnel.

After the Kuomintang reactionary government implemented the "currency system reform" and "price control policy" on August 19th last year, all factories suffered severely. For example, Huaxin Company suffered huge losses because it was forced to sell 5,000 bolts of white cloth to the puppet government at "controlled prices." At the same time, all factories were only operating at half capacity due to a lack of raw materials, resulting in a sharp decline in output and heavy losses. After the liberation of Tianjin, the People's Government provided assistance in various ways to solve the factory's capital and raw material difficulties. However, due to the lack of correct understanding of the People's Government's policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and management, production had not yet recovered rapidly. At that time, on the one hand, the capitalists were unwilling to actively produce and delayed resolving the workers' legitimate demands for wages, year-end bonuses, and welfare, which made the workers' lives extremely difficult and their enthusiasm for production low. On the other hand, some workers mistakenly believed that they could be free from management after liberation and work casually, while production management personnel also adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards production management due to certain ideological concerns. Due to these reasons, production in each factory once declined. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government and the Trade Union mediated labor disputes in each factory, initially resolving some disputes, and continued to do their best to help resolve the difficulties of each factory. For example, in order to help solve the difficulties of Hengyuan, Beiyang, and Dasheng mills in paying employee salaries, year-end bonuses, and capital turnover, the government successively purchased a portion of cotton yarn from the three mills through the Tianjin Municipal Trading Company and provided five consecutive order loans. The Tangshan Trading Company also signed a six-month order contract with Huaxin Company (located in Tangshan) in the form of exchanging cotton for cloth, helping the company solve 70% of its raw material problems. The Tianjin Communications Bank also provided the company with an order loan of 15 million yuan to purchase raw cotton. After these concrete assistance measures from the People's Government, the enthusiasm for production among both labor and management increased, and production began to get on track. At this time, the factory owners began to actively purchase raw materials and repair machinery. For example, Huaxin solved 30% of its own raw material needs, while Hengyuan, Beiyang, and Dasheng all purchased enough raw materials for two to three months. Hengyuan also immediately began repairing the old parts of the incomplete 3,000 spindles. The factories also adjusted and improved workers' wages and welfare, such as calculating wages in kind, subsidizing housing, electricity, and water expenses, and improving nursery work. On the workers' side, their political awareness gradually increased as their living conditions improved, and they all improved their work efficiency and launched competitions. For example, Huaxin employees launched a production competition to support the People's Liberation Army's campaign to cross the Yangtze River and to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day. From mid-February to mid-April, the average daily output of each loom increased by 4 yards. The electricians of the factory improved the method of repairing locomotives, and from March 15th to April 8th, they repaired all 550 locomotives in the factory, saving a total of 773 hours, which resulted in weaving approximately 2,900 more yards of cloth. As of the end of March, Huaxin Company's yarn production had increased from 1,456 bales per month before liberation to 1,568 bales, and cloth production had increased from 19,465 bolts per month to 22,567 bolts. The output of Hengyuan and Dasheng was the same as the normal output of the previous year.

### 明确生产方针调整劳资关系　津三私营纱厂获发展

　　明确生产方针调整劳资关系
  　津三私营纱厂获发展
    【新华社天津二十一日电】天津市四大私营纱厂中的新华、恒源、达生三厂，半年来经人民政府和职工会帮助，逐步调整了劳资关系以后，生产已恢复正常状态，并得到相当发展。三厂纱布产量已恢复或超过天津解放前一九四八年度的正常产量。另一纱厂北洋，则因管理不善，工资及人事等问题长期拖延未解决，产量较解放前尚低。
    去年“八一九”国民党反动政府实行“币制改革”和“限价政策”以后，各厂都曾受到惨重的打击。如华新公司因被迫按“限价”售与伪政府白布五千匹而受巨大损失。同时，各厂均因原料缺乏，仅开半工，以致产量锐减，亏空累累。天津解放后，人民政府即多方协助解决厂方资金、原料困难。但由于劳资双方对人民政府发展生产、劳资两利的政策尚缺乏正确认识，因此生产仍未能迅速恢复。当时，一方面资方不愿积极生产，对于工人的发放工资，年红和福利等正当要求拖延不解决，工人生活异常困难，生产情绪不高；另一方面，部分工人误认为解放后可以不受管理人员管理，工作随便，而生产管理人员也由于思想上存有某些顾虑，对生产管理采取放任自流态度。由于这些原因，各厂生产并曾一度下降。津市人民政府与职工会乃对各厂劳资纠纷进行调解，初步解决了一些纠纷，同时继续尽力帮助解决各厂困难。如为帮助解决恒源、北洋、达生三厂发放职工薪资、年红及资金周转等困难，政府曾先后由津市贸易公司收购该三厂棉纱一部，并予以连续五次的定货贷款。唐山贸易公司亦用以棉易布方式和华新公司（厂址在唐山）订了六个月的定货合同，帮助该公司解决了百分之七十的原料问题。津市交通银行又予该公司以定货贷款一千五百万元，购买原棉。经过人民政府的这些具体的帮助，劳资双方生产情绪提高，生产开始步入正轨。这时，各厂厂方开始积极收购原料，整修机器。如华新自己解决了百分之三十的原料，恒源、北洋、达生都收买了足够两三个月的原料，恒源并即着手修理旧存零件残缺的三千枚纱锭。对于工人工资和福利，各厂也进行了调整和改善，如将工资改以实物计算，补助了房、电、水的费用，改善托儿所工作等。工人方面，因生活得到一些改善，政治觉悟日渐提高，纷纷提高工作效率，并展开竞赛。如华新职工为支援解放军渡江南征和迎接“五一”劳动节，展开了生产竞赛，自二月中旬至四月中旬，每台布机平均每日增产四码。该厂电台职工改进修理机车的办法，从三月十五日至四月八日，把全厂五百五十台机车全部修理好，共节省七百七十三小时，约多织布二千九百余码。截至三月底，华新公司纱产量已由解放前月产一千四百五十六件增至一千五百六十八件，布则由月产一万九千四百六十五匹增至二万二千五百六十七匹。恒源、达生产量则与去年正常产量相平。
