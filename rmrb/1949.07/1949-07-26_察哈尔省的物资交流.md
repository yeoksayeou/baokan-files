　　Chahar Province's Material Exchange
　　Our reporter in Zhangjiakou Lü Guangming
　　Chahar Province is rich in millet, wheat, oats, furs, and flax, with fruits, mountain products, and medicinal materials as its special products. These special products can be sold well both at home and abroad. The export of local products from Tianjin accounts for about one-fifth of its total exports each year. Handicraft products such as the fur manufacturing industry in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, the felt hat and shoe industry in Xuanhua, and the alkali in Yangyuan also had a wide market in the past. The agricultural and special products exported domestically and abroad from the five special districts of Chabei, Nankou, Pingxi, Chanan, and Yanbei account for more than 62% of their total land income for the year. Communicating the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and vigorously exporting surplus materials are important keys to improving the reproductive capacity of farmers in Chahar Province, increasing their purchasing power, and opening up the market for industrial products. A large part of the fur, livestock, and medicinal materials from Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan, and the fur, grain, and bristles from Ningxia are also collected and distributed through Zhangjiakou. Industrial products from Tianjin, Hebei, and Shandong plains, as well as brick tea from Central China and raw tobacco from Quwo, Shanxi, are also collected and distributed through Chahar Province to Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia, and Ningxia. This shows that Chahar Province occupies an important position in North China and in domestic and foreign trade.
　　In order to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and develop domestic and foreign trade, the Chahar Provincial Trade Company established five specialized companies in Zhangjiakou at the beginning of this spring: grain, fur, salt, coal and iron, and cloth and cotton. After the Inner Mongolia Trade Company took over the former Inner Mongolia Tea and Tobacco Company in Zhangjiakou, the "Ximeng Trade Administration Zhangjiakou Office" was established on February 1. Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua cities also successively established city and district supply and marketing cooperatives, and established Zhangjiakou Farmers' Hostel. On April 1, the Chahar Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative was established, followed by the trial operation of urban supply and marketing cooperatives in eight county towns and ten important market towns along the Ping-Sui East Section. In early May, Chahar Province also established a specialized agency for unified purchase and sale of mountain products and medicinal materials. These trade and cooperative institutions have played a certain role, and achieved many results, in promoting the exchange of materials, implementing mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and reducing intermediate exploitation. In the six months after the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, the Chahar Trade Company purchased more than 80 million catties of grain such as rice and wheat. Adding the amount purchased and sold by private merchants in rural areas, it is estimated that Chahar Province has transferred no less than 200 million catties of food to Tianjin and Beijing in the past six months. Since the past six months, the company has operated more than 45,000 animal hides, nearly 310,000 catties of wool, and nearly 10,000 catties of bristles. These materials are mostly transported to Tianjin for export. From last winter to this spring, state-owned and public trade agencies in North China and Inner Mongolia transported 5,000 cattle from various leagues and banners, and sold them to rural areas in North China. According to the statistics of the Zhangjiakou Taxation Bureau in January, February, and March, a total of more than 15,000 heads of cattle, sheep, mules, horses, donkeys, camels, and pigs were traded, with sheep and cattle being the most numerous. In addition to supplying the local people with living and production materials, the supply and marketing cooperatives in the towns along the Ping-Sui line also organized the disaster-stricken people in Longguan, Yanqing, Huairou, and Chongli counties to dig up medicinal materials. As of June 15, more than 344,400 catties of medicinal materials have been purchased. In order to support special products and reward exports, the provincial cooperative has pre-purchased local flax in Chabei with 20,000 bolts of native cloth. The purchased medicinal materials and flax have also been transported to Tianjin one after another and are preparing to be transported to Tianjin for export. The "Hengchang" egg factory, supported by the state-owned economy, officially started operations in Zhangjiakou on June 11, manufacturing egg yolks and egg whites, requiring 130,000 eggs per day. The first batch of pre-priced orders of 40 tons from the North China Foreign Trade Company has opened up the egg market for the Chabei rural areas, where each person has an average of six chickens.
　　The Chahar Provincial Trade Company and its specialized companies have also provided a relatively sufficient supply of living and production materials to the vast rural areas of Chahar and Inner Mongolia. In the past six months, more than 720,000 bolts of native cloth and more than 90,000 catties of cotton have been transported to Zhangjiakou from Central Hebei and Western Hebei. 61,700 bolts of various kinds of foreign cloth and other daily necessities have been transported from Tianjin. The Chahar Provincial Salt Company transported 11,310,000 catties of Changlu salt and 50,000 catties of Daqing salt from Duolun. From February to April, the Inner Mongolia Tea and Tobacco Company in Zhangjiakou and the Zhangjiakou Office of the Ximeng Trade Administration transported more than 15,000 catties of Hunan-produced brick tea to Inner Mongolia, as well as more than 5,000 catties of ox cart equipment, and a large number of raw tobacco, foreign cloth, Mongolian boots, soap, sugar and other daily necessities to meet the needs of the Mongolian people. In order to adapt to the needs of the people's life and production in the Mongolian and Han areas, and to reduce intermediate exploitation, the Chahar Provincial Trade Company signed the first supply and marketing contract with the Ximeng Trade Administration in March. In June, the Beijing Trade Company also signed a material exchange contract worth 100 million yuan with the Bureau, both of which exchanged industrial products for their pastoral products.
　　In the process of exchange, the prices of agricultural and pastoral products have been raised relatively appropriately, so that the exchange of industrial and agricultural products is gradually developing in a rational direction. At the beginning of this spring, farmers in Shangdu exchanged 1,900 catties of wheat for a bolt of white foreign cloth from private merchants, and 150 catties of wheat for a bolt of 32-square-foot native cloth, which gradually changed to 300 catties of wheat for a bolt of foreign cloth. For example, in the past, one catty of millet could only be exchanged for one catty of salt, but now it can be exchanged for one catty and twelve taels. The urban supply and marketing cooperatives of Chahar Province and the specialized companies of Chahar Trade have also set up many outlets, and through joint operations, public-owned stores in various places and the Zhangjiakou Farmers' Hostel, they have made some direct and relatively direct exchanges of industrial and agricultural products with farmers. At present, in some rural areas with inconvenient transportation and far away from towns, the excessive intermediate exploitation of commercial capital still exists seriously. For example, in the Gehuasitai area of ​​Shangdu in Chabei, farmers have to spend 7.5 dou of wheat to exchange for a 32-square-foot bolt of native cloth. Five eggs in Zhangjiakou are exchanged for a pack of matches, and thirty eggs are exchanged for a pack of matches in Gehuasitai and Chongli villages.
　　Promoting material exchange must be grasped at present, transforming the old society into a new society, transforming wartime into peacetime, and fully entering the general characteristics of production and construction. In order to overcome the blindness of production, to achieve planned production, and to make production subordinate to exchange, we must deeply understand and implement Chairman Mao's "from all directions" policy. Find sales from all directions and find raw materials from all directions. Conduct a good survey of supply and demand contradictions, and pay close attention to changes in production and sales. For example, industries such as superstitious products and gold and silver jewelry that serve the old society should be quickly encouraged to change their careers, and some industries whose needs have decreased should find new ways out. For example, there are more than 3,000 saltpeter workers in Zhengding, whose sideline business has been suspended due to the suspension of fire salt collection. The Lingshan Coal Mine in the western Hebei mountains was in short supply during the war because it supplied fuel to military factories. If the porcelain industry in the area is not restored, the bituminous coal will have no way out. Although the production and sales of certain handicrafts in Chahar Province have changed somewhat, they still have a certain market. For example, the rural hand-woven textile industry has developed during the war. At present, due to the entry of foreign yarn and foreign cloth into the countryside, it seems that native yarn and native cloth can no longer be developed. However, as long as we find ways to reduce costs, improve quality, and sell more at a lower profit, they still have a certain market. Foreign cloth and foreign yarn are not enough to meet the needs of all rural areas. Especially in the colder areas of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Inner Mongolia, people welcome native cloth because it can keep out the cold and is more durable than foreign cloth. The Jixi branches of Chahar Trade Company exchanged foreign yarn for native cloth, supported the production of native cloth, fixed the profit of native cloth by exchanging a fixed amount of yarn for a fixed amount of cloth, and avoided the impact of price fluctuations. The use of foreign yarn as the warp of native cloth not only improved the quality of native cloth, but also freed up a large amount of cotton for Tianjin China Textile. For example, the felt hats and shoes in Chahar Province were mainly sold to the Northeast before the war, but now the Northeast can manufacture them by itself. The leather strips and leather jackets produced in Duolun were sold in large quantities to Inner Mongolia before the war. During the war, with the support of the People's Government, Inner Mongolia was also able to manufacture them by itself, but it was far from meeting the actual needs. According to the Xuanhua Municipal Government, officials were sent to the Northeast to find sales, and they learned that felt hats were in short supply in the Northeast, and various places still hoped that the velvet hats from Chahar Province would be sold in the Northeast. The Xuanhua People's Bank launched regular loans to support the felt hat industry and hemp paper industry to expand production, which is necessary and correct.
　　The Chahar Provincial Industrial Inspection Group went to Tianjin for sightseeing and found that the hand-spun wool in Zhangjiakou can be used as the raw material for the Tianjin female workers' carpet. They are now negotiating a contract with a factory in Tianjin. If they can deliver the goods as required, Zhangjiakou will have an output of 40,000 catties of wool per month. For example, in the egg-beating industry, egg whites can be used as raw materials for chemicals and western medicines, and egg yolks can be used as raw materials for food. They can be sold in large quantities at home and abroad. The industrial and commercial leaders of Chahar Province are planning to support the "Hengchang Egg Beating Factory" in Zhangjiakou to expand its production capacity from 130,000 eggs per day to 180,000 to 240,000 eggs. In the past, there was an egg-beating factory with 500 workers in Hunyuan, Yanbei, which was closed during the war. Efforts should be made to rebuild it. Secondly, the fine skin has been sold to Shanghai through private merchants. The sales of alkali are not smooth in Tianjin and Beijing (Tianjin produces a large amount of chemical alkali). After the north-south transportation is smooth and the sales in the Yangtze River basin are opened, the production of alkali still has a certain development prospect. Bai Ma is produced in Chanan, with an annual output of 4.5 million catties. Bai Ma is the raw material for making ropes and weaving linen and making banknote paper. It is widely used in cities and villages. Flax in Chabei can be used as a good oil and is conducive to foreign exports. These two special products should be planted in large quantities. After returning from a visit to the Beijing Industrial Exhibition, the Zhangjiakou business community immediately invited managers from flour, oil pressing, iron casting, and soap factories to discuss improving technology and improving quality to facilitate sales. The city's seven casting industries produce 42 tons of pots per month, which are sold in rural areas. In addition, Chanan coal has also begun to be sold in Chabei, in order to change the local people's habit of burning cow dung and use cow dung for fertilizing fields to increase production.
　　Chahar Province has a vast area, sparse villages, and few people, and transportation is a big problem. For example, the coarse grains such as oats and buckwheat in Chabei have small capital and high labor costs, and general merchants are unwilling to operate. The Daqing salt in Inner Mongolia is of good quality and its output can also be increased, but the ox carts travel 30 miles a day, and one ox cart is broken after one trip, so Daqing salt cannot be sold due to high transportation costs. On July 11, the survey team jointly formed by the Industry and Commerce Department of Chahar Province and the Chahar Trade Company went to Chabei to investigate the production and sales situation, transportation tools, and transportation capacity. Originally, our transportation capacity was very lacking during the war, and now it is obviously insufficient to cooperate with modern railway transportation. Therefore, we must consider the issue of establishing a specialized transportation agency in order to be responsible for organizing and improving transportation capacity. The use and repair of human and animal vehicles, the manufacture and sales of rough skins, saddles, hemp ropes, shoe pads, etc. required for transportation, and the manufacture and sales of packaging materials such as wicker baskets and bamboo mats should also be appropriately restored and developed.
　　To reduce excessive intermediate exploitation and promote mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, we must start from two aspects: Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels and public trade agencies at all levels must face the countryside and penetrate into the countryside, develop and establish supply and marketing networks and trade networks, and establish direct and relatively direct connections with farmers. On the other hand, leaders at all levels should immediately check all kinds of restrictions that are harmful to material exchange, such as Shangdu and Tianzhen not allowing more purchases and sales, restricting the number of grain purchases, and not allowing more than three dou. Some even prohibit barter and restrict private merchants from going to the countryside. Chaigoubao in Chanan once issued an order prohibiting transactions in the countryside. For example, Zhuoxian County in Pingxi organized handicraft workers as brokers, and they had to pay even if the transaction was not concluded. Relevant departments should earnestly check and correct such things. The government should encourage legitimate and law-abiding merchants to cooperate with state-owned commerce and cooperative undertakings to jointly serve urban and rural producers, find raw materials for them, find sales outlets, and supply living materials, so that cities and villages, production and consumption, can form a new and complete connection and law through commerce. The exchange of industrial and agricultural products will gradually become rational, and intermediate exploitation will gradually be reduced.

　　察哈尔省的物资交流
    本报驻张记者  吕光明
    察哈尔省盛产小米、小麦、莜麦、皮毛、胡麻，特产以果类、山货、药材为主。这些特产都能畅销中外，每年由津出口之土产，约占其总出口数的五分之一。手工业品如张、宣等地的皮毛制造业、宣化的绒帽毡鞋、阳原的口碱，过去销路亦很广。察北、南口、平西、察南、雁北五个专区，全年输往国内外的农产、特产，约占其土地总收人数的百分之六十二强。沟通城乡物资交流，大力输出剩余物资，是提高察哈尔省农民再生产的能力，提高其购买力与开拓工业品市场的重要关键。内蒙、绥远的皮毛、牲畜、药材，宁夏的皮毛、粮食、猪鬃，也有一大部分经由张垣集散。平津及冀、鲁平原的工业品与华中的砖茶、晋南曲沃的生烟，也经由察省集散到绥、蒙、宁夏各地。这都说明察省在华北与国内外贸易上，占有重要地位。
    为促进城乡物资交流与发展国内外贸易，今年春初，察省贸易公司在张垣分设了粮食、皮毛、盐业、煤铁、布棉等五个专业公司。内蒙贸易公司接收了原在张垣之内蒙茶烟公司后，二月一日又成立了“西蒙贸易管理局张垣办事处”。张、宣两市也相继成立了市、区供销合作社，并创办了张市农民招待栈。四月一日，察省供销总社成立了，接着在平绥东段沿线的八个县城及十个重要集镇，试办了城镇供销合作社。五月初，察省又成立了统一购销山货药材的专门机构。这些贸易、合作机构，对沟通物资交流，实行城乡互助，减轻中间剥削，都起了一定的作用，获致不少成绩。平津解放后的六个月中，察哈尔贸易公司共收购米、麦等粮食八千余万斤。加上私商下乡购销数目，估计半年来察省调剂给平津的食粮当不下两万万斤。半年以来，该公司经营皮子四万五千余张，毛近三十一万斤，猪鬃近万斤。此项物资多运津出口。去冬今春，华北与内蒙各地国营及公营贸易机关，从各盟旗运出牛五千头，分别销往华北各地农村。据张市税务局一二三月份统计，牛羊骡马驴驼猪共成交一万五千余头，其中以羊牛为最多。平绥沿线的城镇供销合作社除供应当地群众生活、生产资料外。还组织了龙关、延庆、怀柔、崇礼等四县的灾区群众刨药材。截至六月十五日止，已收购药材三十四万四千余斤。为扶植特产，奖励输出，省社在察北以两万匹土布预购当地胡麻。已收购之药材、胡麻，也陆续运津与准备运津出口。在国营经济扶持下的“恒昌”打蛋厂，六月十一日在张市正式开工，制造蛋黄蛋白，日需鸡蛋十三万个。华北对外贸易公司首批预价定货四十吨，这给每人平均六只鸡的察北农村，开拓了鸡蛋的销路。
    察省贸易公司及各专业公司，也比较充分地供应了察蒙各地广大乡村以生活、生产资料，半年来，从冀中、冀西运来张市之土布达七十二万余匹，棉花九万余斤。从天津运来各色洋布六万一千七百余匹及其他日用品一部。察省盐业公司运来长芦盐一千一百三十一万斤，从多伦运来大青盐五万斤。二、四月间，经由张垣内蒙茶烟公司、西蒙贸易管理局张垣办事处，运往内蒙之湘产砖茶达一万五千余斤，另牛车器材五千余斤，及大批生烟、洋布、蒙靴、肥皂、糖等日用品，供蒙民需用，为适应蒙汉两区人民生活生产需要，调剂有无，减轻中间剥削，察省贸易公司在三月间与西蒙贸易管理局订立首次供销合同。六月间北平贸易公司亦与该局签订了价值一亿元的物资交换合同，两者都是以工业品交换其牧产品。
    在交换过程中，已经比较适当的提高了农、牧产品的价格，使工、农产品逐渐向合理交换的方向发展。商都农民在今年春初，以一千九百斤小麦换私商一匹白洋布，以一百五十斤小麦换一匹三十二方尺的土布，后逐渐改为三百几十斤小麦换一匹洋布。又如以粮换盐，在过去一斤小米只能换一斤盐，现在能换一斤十二两。察省的城镇供销合作社，察贸各专业公司，也多自设门市部，并通过联业，通过各地公营商店及张市农民招待栈，和农民作了一些直接与比较直接的工农产品的交换。现在某些交通不便而又距城镇较远的乡区，商业资本过高的中间剥削依然严重存在。如察北商都的哥花斯太区，农民花七·五市斗小麦，才换一匹三十二方尺的土布。张家口五个鸡蛋换一包火柴，哥花斯太与崇礼乡村，都是用三十个鸡蛋换一包火柴。
    促进物资交流，在目前必须掌握住，变旧社会为新社会，变战时为平时与全全面进入生产建设的总特点。以期克服生产盲目性，做到生产有计划，做到生产服从交流，就必须深刻体会与贯彻毛主席指示的“四面八方”的政策。从四面八方打销路，从四面八方找原料。很好调查供求矛盾，与很好注意产销情况变化。如为旧社会服务的迷信品、金银首饰等行业，应迅速鼓励其转业，还有些目前需要已减少的行业，应找新的出路。比如正定有三千多硝民，因停收火硝，副业停顿。冀西山区的灵山煤矿，战时因供给军火厂燃料，而曾供不应求，现在因军火减产，如不恢复该地区的磁窑业，烟煤即无出路。察省某些手工业品，产销情况纵有些变化，但还有它一定的销路。如农村手工纺织业，在战时获得发展，目前因洋纱洋布下乡，土纱土布似乎是不能再事发展。但只要设法降低成本，提高质量，薄利多销，仍有它一定市场。洋布洋纱还不足以解决全部农村的需要。特别是在察绥蒙比较寒冷的地区，人们欢迎土布，因服土布比服洋布能御寒耐穿。察贸公司冀西各分支公司，以洋纱换土布，扶持了土布生产，以定量的纱换定量的布，固定了土布的利润，避免受物价波动的影响。至土布用洋纱做经线，不但提高了土布的质量，还能余出一大部分棉花，供给天津中纺。又如察省的绒帽毡鞋，战前主要销东北，现东北已能自行制造。多伦出的皮条、皮袄，战前大量销内蒙。战争中，经人民政府的扶持，内蒙亦能自行制造，但远赶不上实际需要。按宣化市当局曾派员去东北打销路，才知道东北毡帽供不应求，各地仍希望察省绒帽去东北行销，宣化人民银行举办定期贷款扶植毡帽业、麻纸业扩大生产，是必要而且正确。
    察省工业考察团，去天津观光，发现张市手工纺毛线，可以做天津女工地毯的原料，现正与天津某厂磋商合同，如能照样子交货，张市每月当有四万斤毛线的输出。又如打蛋业，蛋白可做化学、西药原料，蛋黄可做食品原料。在国内外都能大量行销。察省工商业领导上，正拟扶助张市之“恒昌打蛋厂”，扩大生产量，由每天打蛋十三万个增加到十八万个到二十四万个。雁北浑源过去有五百工人的打蛋厂一座，在战争中停闭，现应设法重建，其次是细皮，已通过私商去上海打销路。口碱在平津销路不畅（按天津出大量化学碱），待南北车运畅通，与长江流域的销路打开后，口碱生产仍有它的一定发展前途。察南出白麻，年产四百五十万斤，白麻系制绳与纺织麻布、做钞票纸的原料，城市乡村用途颇广。察北的胡麻，可做很好的油料，有利于国外输出。此两种特产物应大量种植。张市工商界参观北平工展归来后，立即邀请了面粉、榨油、铸铁、肥皂等厂商经理，座谈改进技术，提高质量，以利销售。该市七家铸造业，月产锅四十二吨，行销农村。此外察南煤也开始在察北打销路，以期改变当地群众燃烧牛粪的习惯，把牛粪用作肥田增产。
    察省地区辽阔，村稀人少，交通运输是一个大问题。如察北的莜面、荞麦等粗糙粮种，本钱不大，脚力很贵，一般商人都不愿经营。内蒙的大青盐质量很好，产量也能增加，但牛拖车日行三十里，拉一趟就坏一架牛车，大青盐致因运费太贵而无法销售。七月十一日，察省工商处、察贸公司合组之调查团，去察北调查产销情况，调查交通工具与运输力。本来在战时，我们的运输力就很缺乏，现在要与近代化的铁路运输相配合，显然是不足。因之必须考虑到筹设专门运输机构的问题，以便负责组织与改进运输力，对人畜车辆的使用与修造，对为运输所需要粗皮、鞍架、麻绳、打掌等与对包装用的荆筐、席篓等的制造业和贩卖业，亦应适当恢复发展。
    至减轻过高的中间剥削，发扬城乡互助，必须从两方面着手；各级供销社，各级公营贸易机关，必须面向农村与深入农村，发展与建立供销网、贸易网，与农民发生直接与比较直接的连系。另一方面，各级领导上应立即检查有害于物资交流的各种限制，如商都、天镇等地不准多买多卖，限制购粮数目，不准超过三斗。有的还禁止以物易物，与限制私商下乡。察南柴沟堡，曾下过命令，不准在乡下成交。又如平西涿县，把手工业工人组织起来当牙纪，不成交也要钱。诸如此类，有关方面应切实检查纠正。政府应鼓励正当守法的商人，配合国营商业，合作事业，共同为城乡生产者服务，为他们找原料，打销路，及供应生活资料，使城市与乡村、生产与消费，通过商业构成一种新的完好的联系和规律。在工、农物品的交换上，便会逐渐走向合理，中间剥削也就会逐渐减轻。
