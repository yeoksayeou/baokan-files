    Departure to Sanqiu Village
    Before dawn on June 21st, around two or three o'clock, the students of North China University in Zhengding were already up and forming ranks, preparing to depart for Sanqiu Village. Before long, the neat ranks stepped out of the east gate, everyone in high spirits.
    The sky gradually brightened, and the beans, sorghum, cotton, and peanuts in the fields grew lush and beautiful. When the sun rose high, they arrived at the village hidden by the woods—Sanqiu Village, twenty-five miles from Zhengding.
    Before the team even entered the street, the villagers happily said, "The students from North China University are here again!"
    It was the busy farming season. The villagers had just finished harvesting wheat and were about to plant sweet potatoes. In addition, it had been somewhat dry recently. Although this area was irrigated by water pumped from the mountains and didn't fear drought, they had to pull water carts all day long, which consumed a lot of manpower and animal power. Therefore, the villagers of Sanqiu Village were working in the fields almost all day long. After everyone arrived in Sanqiu Village, they took the initiative to help the villagers with their work.
    As soon as the 54th Team arrived in Sanqiu, it launched a "Fill the Water Jar Movement," with each group filling the water jars in the homes of the villagers they were staying with.
    The 58th Team launched a "Help the Villagers Work" challenge. The comrades of the fourth group helped the villagers sweep manure and build toilets as soon as they arrived at their lodgings. Comrade Cheng Yongbo even pushed the millstone for the villagers despite being ill.
    Comrade Bu Zhikun from the 60th Team spun thread for an old woman. She spun it finely, quickly, and well. The old woman sat beside her, so happy that she couldn't close her mouth. Comrade Chen Zhaoying cleaned the yard for the villagers every day, washed clothes, and bathed the children, becoming like family with the villagers.
    Visiting the Villagers
    Soon after arriving in Sanqiu, everyone began making visits. Based on past experience, the squad leaders reported the things to pay attention to during the visits. For example, it was important to know the class background of the people being visited before the visit, because it was the emancipated poor and tenant farmers who could help the students. Therefore, everyone decided to visit emancipated poor and tenant farmers more often in order to strengthen our revolutionary stance.
    The method of visiting was "from near to far," starting with the landlords they were staying with.
    There was an old woman where the fifth group of the 56th Team was staying. She attended their small group discussions every night. This old woman had participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the discussion she said: "Don't be homesick, you must make revolution well and see that the whole country is about to be victorious!" The students were especially inspired by the old woman's encouragement. Some of the students brought cameras and took pictures with the old woman to commemorate the occasion. This old woman had a goddaughter who was a student at North China University. When the 13th Class of North China University came to Sanqiu Village for a visit in the past, a female comrade stayed here. She missed home and was emotional, and was crying when the old woman saw her, and asked her why she was crying. She told her later, and the old woman explained to her and told her to make revolution well. After some persuasion, this female comrade got her thinking straightened out and became sworn mother and daughter with the old woman. Now she often writes letters. We visited this old woman a lot.
    The most visited person was also Zhou Shuqin, the director of the Women's Federation. She was a labor hero, only nineteen years old and a member of the Communist Youth League. She was very good at labor, never idle all day long. She did a good job of working in the fields and at home. She also spun thread in the cellar in winter. She said: "Women are very eager to learn culture, I hope you can help more!"
    Listening to Reports from Village Cadres and Visiting the Tunnels
    Every morning was time for listening to reports from village cadres. Village Chief Lu Wenqing and Civil Affairs Officer Lu Wenzhan jointly introduced the general situation of Sanqiu Village. Lu Wenqing mainly introduced the organizational system, how the hidden farmers' association was established during the Anti-Japanese War, how the farmers' association went from secret to public, how some landlords and rich peasants betrayed the nation during the Anti-Japanese War, and introduced the birth of the New Farmers' Association in the class struggle, the establishment of the land reform poor peasant corps, and the establishment of the current village representative assembly and the organization of mass groups. In addition, he briefly introduced organizations such as the Party branch, the New Democratic Youth League, and the Women's Federation. Civil Affairs Officer Lu Wenzhan introduced the history of struggle in Sanqiu, from the Anti-Japanese War, the Liberation War, land reform to the large-scale production movement.
    Wei Wenzuo reported on two topics: "The War of Resistance Against Japan" and "Land Reform." What he talked about was not only the history of Sanqiu Village, but also his own history. He was a member of the guerrilla group during the Anti-Japanese War. After countless struggles, he is now a public security officer in the county. He is a burly man, representing the character of Chinese peasants, simple, strong, and resolute. Some students who sympathized with the landlords in their thinking, after listening to his report, everyone increased their class feelings.
    Lu Yong'an reported on the experience of tunnel warfare. He spoke about his personal experience. He led twenty-eight militiamen and bravely defeated the invasion of Chiang Kai-shek's army and two regiments of the landlord-organized home-returning corps. He said: "In tunnel warfare, the enemy can never find one of us. There are above-ground blockhouses and underground blockhouses at the entrance of the village. The tunnels throughout the village are interconnected. There are combat tunnels and hidden tunnels. Our tunnels are not afraid of the enemy flooding them or burning them. There are meeting rooms in the tunnels. Even if the enemy enters the village, our cadres can safely hold meetings underground. There are also places for detaining and trying the enemy, so when the enemy enters the village, we can still try them underground. Our tunnels are connected to wells, so we are not afraid of not having water to drink. Mines are all over the village, and iron wires are all in the tunnels. As long as the enemy enters the village, the militiamen will pull the iron wires, and the enemies on the ground will be blown to pieces. There are gun holes everywhere in the village, so the enemy does not know when they will be shot from the wall roots by bullets flying out of the ground, so the enemy is terrified when they see rat holes in Sanqiu..."
    After listening to these introductions and reports, the New Fourth District Team visited the tunnels led by the children's corps. Sure enough, it was just as Lu Yong'an said. During the visit to the tunnels, they lit lamps in front, and many people took the wrong paths. After the visit, the students all admired the greatness of the people's power. A student who used to study civil engineering said: "The peasants are really amazing, how can they build such tunnels without surveying?"
    Holding Symposiums with Peasants
    The New Fourth District Team held three symposiums with the peasants in Sanqiu, namely "Symposium of Emancipated Peasants," "Symposium of Women," and "Symposium of the New Democratic Youth League."
    The "Symposium of Emancipated Peasants" was held by team, with the themes of "The True Situation of Landlord Exploitation," "The Situation Before and After Emancipation," and "Large-Scale Production" and "Transformation of Second-Rate Elements," emphasizing the combination with the study of policy courses. The students were greatly moved at the meeting.
    On June 24, more than 200 female students from the Fourth District Team and the Women's Federation of Sanqiu Village held a "Symposium of Women." The symposium included the situation of the women of Sanqiu Village fighting against the enemy, the situation of the women's movement in the land reform, the status of women before and after emancipation, and how the status of women was improved, etc... At the meeting, Zhou Shuqin said: "If you want equality between men and women, you must first be able to work as hard as men." So she did the same work as men at home and in the fields. In addition to washing clothes and cooking, she also went to the fields every day to change ditches, hoe seedlings, cut rice, and push water carts, etc. At the end of last year, she was selected as a labor hero, and now the women of the whole village are led by her in production. At the meeting, other women also said: "In order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek quickly, many women let their sons and husbands join the army to kill the enemy, and they also write letters on ordinary days to encourage their husbands and sons to fight heroically."
    On the afternoon of the 25th, in the midst of singing and laughter, a "Symposium of the Youth League" was held in the light rain. In addition to all the Youth League members of the New Fourth District Team, in order to expand the influence of the League, all students who applied to join the League or wanted to learn about the League could participate. In addition to the Youth League members of Sanqiu Village, young Party members also participated. Zhang Choubao, the secretary of the Youth League branch in Sanqiu Village, talked at the meeting about how the rural Youth League took the lead in large-scale production, the more he talked, the happier he became, and he talked about the work arranged by the higher authorities for Sanqiu from the establishment of the League to the present. He said: "Why do we want to grow more peanuts and cotton? We all know that we want to develop industry now. Peanut oil is a very good industrial raw material. Now that the big cities of Pingjin have been liberated, the big machines have to turn. How can we spin yarn and weave cloth without cotton?..." He also reported how their League members responded to the call, drove the youth, and how to hold family meetings to persuade their parents.
    The Youth League members of North China University learned about the general situation of the rural Youth League and the tasks and work of the rural Youth League at this meeting. Those who had not applied to join the League and did not understand the League also began to have a great change in their views on the League.
    After dinner on the 29th, the team was reorganized and returned to Zhengding.

　　三邱村之行
  　华北大学新四区队下乡向农民学习
    向青
    出发到三邱村去
    六月二十一日天还没有亮，大约才两三点钟，正定的华大同学们都已起身整队了，准备出发到三邱村去。没有多久，整齐的队伍就踏出了东城门，每个人的心情都是兴奋的。
    天渐渐亮了，野外的豆子、高粱、棉花、花生长得油绿好看。当太阳高升的时候，便到了这树林掩盖了的村庄——离正定二十五里的三邱村。
    队伍还没进街，老乡便高兴的说：“华大的同学们又来了！”
    正是农忙时节，老乡刚忙过了麦收，马上就要种红薯了；加以近来天有些旱，这一带都是水灌山，虽然不怕旱，可是整天要拉水车，耗费人力畜力很大，因此三邱村的老乡几乎整天都在地里干活儿。大家到了三邱村后便主动地去帮助老乡工作。
    五十四队才到三邱就发动了一个“满缸运动”，每个组把自己所住的老乡家里的水缸都给打满了水。
    五十八队展开了“帮助老乡工作”的大挑战，四组同志才到住地就帮助老乡从屋往外打扫马粪修筑厕所，程永波同志带病还给老乡推磨。
    六十队同学卜智坤替老大娘纺线，她纺得又精又细又快又好，老大娘坐在旁边乐得嘴都合不上了，同学陈兆英每天给老乡打扫院子、洗衣服、给小孩洗澡，和老乡成一家人了。
    向老乡访问
    到了三邱不久，大家便开始了访问。根据过去的经验，班队长都报告了访问应注意的事情，比如在访问之先一定要知道访问对象的成份，因对同学有帮助的就是翻身的贫雇农，所以大家决定多访问翻身贫雇农，以坚定我们革命立场。
    访问的方式是“由近及远”，先从自己所住的房东那里开始。
    五十六队第五组住的地方有个老大娘，每天晚上的小组漫谈会她都参加。这个老大娘过去参加过抗日战争，在漫谈会她说：“别想家，要好好革命，看全国都要胜利！”同学们让老大娘给鼓励得情绪特别饱满，同学们有的带着照像机，还和老大娘照像，表示纪念。这位老大娘有个干女儿便是华大同学，过去华大十三班到三邱村参观的时候，有个女同志住在这儿了，她想家闹情绪，正在掉泪的时候，让老大娘看见了，便问她为什么哭，她后来说了，老大娘便给她解释，告诉她要好好革命，经过几番劝说，这位女同志思想搞通了，便和这老大娘做了义母女，现在经常来信。我们访问这位老大娘的很多。
    访问最多的还有个妇女会主任周淑琴，她是个劳动英雄，才十九岁是个青年团员，她的劳动非常好，整天没有闲着的时候，地里活计家里活计干得都挺好，冬天还在地窖里纺线。她说：“妇女们都很希望学文化，望你们多帮助！”
    听村干部报告与地道参观
    每天早晨的时间都是听村干部报告的时间，村长卢文清和民政卢文占共同介绍了三邱村的一般情况。卢文清主要是介绍组织系统，以前在抗日时期隐蔽的农会是怎样成立起来的，农会怎样由秘密而公开，有的地主富农在抗日战争中如何叛变了民族，并且介绍了阶级斗争中新农会的诞生，土地改革贫农团的成立以及现在村代表会的成立和群众小组的编制。此外并简单介绍了党的支部、新民主主义青年团、妇女会等组织。民政卢文占介绍三邱斗争历史，从抗日、解放战争、土地改革到大生产运动。
    魏文佐报告“抗日战争”和“土地改革”两个专题，他所讲的不但是三邱村的历史，同时也是他本身的历史，他是抗日时期的游击小组组员，经过不知多少次斗争，现在在县里当公安员，他是个粗壮的大汉子，代表着中国农民的性格，朴实、坚强、刚毅。有的同学在思想上还同情地主的听了他的报告之后，每个人都增加了阶级感情。
    卢永安报告地道战的经验，他讲着他亲身的经历，他带领二十八个民兵，英勇地战败了蒋介石的军队和地主组织的还乡团的两个团兵力的进犯；他说：“在地道战中间，敌人永远不能发现我们一个人，在村口有地上炮楼，也有地下炮楼，全村的地道互相沟通着，有战斗地道有隐藏地道，我们的地道不怕敌人水灌或用火烧。在地道里有会议室，尽管敌人进了村，我们的干部可以安然地在地下开会，也有拘押审判敌人的地方，所以当敌人进村的时候，我们还可以在地下审判，我们的地道连着井，所以不怕没有水喝，地雷布满了全村，铁线都在地道里，只要敌人一进村，民兵便拉铁线，地面上的敌人便炸得粉碎，全村各个地方都有枪眼，所以敌人不知什么时候就被我们从地下墙根飞出来子弹打死，所以敌人在三邱看到老鼠洞就魂不附体……”
    新四区队在听完了这些介绍与报告之后，便由儿童团带领参观地道，果然和卢永安所讲的一样，在参观地道中间前面点着灯，有许多人还走错了路，在参观之后，同学们都景仰人民力量的伟大，一个过去学土木工程的同学说：“农民可真了不起，不会测量怎能修这样的地道呢？”
    和农民开座谈会
    新四区队在三邱和农民开了三个座谈会，那便是“翻身农民座谈会”“妇女座谈会”和“新民主主义青年团座谈会”。
    “翻身农民座谈会”是以队为单位开的，内容是以“地主剥削的真实情况”“翻身前后的情况”和“大生产”与“改造二流子”为主题，强调了和政策课的学习结合起来，同学们在会上都大为感动。
    六月二十四日，四区队全体女同学二百多人和三邱村妇女会开了“妇女座谈会”。座谈内容有三邱村妇女对敌斗争的情形，土改中的妇女运动情形，翻身前后的妇女地位以及妇女的地位怎样提高的等……。在大会上周淑琴说：“要想男女平等，必先能和男人一样劳动。”所以她在家中地里都和男人一样做活儿，除洗衣服、做饭外，还每天下地改沟、锄苗、割禾、推水车等，去年年底她被选做了劳动英雄，现在全村妇女都由她领导生产。在会上别的妇女也讲：“为了很快的打败蒋介石，许多妇女都让她们的儿子丈夫去参军杀敌，平常日子也写信去鼓励她们的丈夫儿子去英勇作战。”
    二十五日午后在歌声欢唱中间，在小雨里开了“青年团座谈会”，参加座谈的除了新四区队全体团员外，为了扩大团的影响，凡是申请入团的同学或是想了解团的都可参加，三邱村除了青年团员外，年青的党员也参加了。三邱村青年团支部书记张丑宝在会上讲农村青年团如何带头大生产，越讲越高兴，并且把三邱从团成立时起以至现在上级给布置的工作都谈了。他说：“我们为什么要多种花生和棉花呢？我们都知道现在要发展工业，花生油是很好的工业原料，现在平津大都市都解放了，大机器都要转动起来了，我们没有棉花怎能纺纱织布呢？……”他还报告了他们团员如何响应号召，带动青年，如何开家庭会议说服家长。
    华大的青年团员在这次会上学习了农村青年团的一般情况，及农村青年团的任务与工作，未申请入团的和不了解团的也开始对团的看法大有改变。
    二十九日晚饭后又整好了队伍回到了正定。
