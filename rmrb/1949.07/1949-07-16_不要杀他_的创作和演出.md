    Creation and Performance of "Don't Kill Him"
    Liujia
    After the performance of the play "Don't Kill Him" by the Anti-Enemy Drama Society at the Literary and Art Congress, it aroused—mainly regarding the theme and creative methods of the script—many divergent opinions of a principled nature. We are willing to listen to these opinions with a learning attitude and continue to solicit and carefully study them. We will sincerely accept the opinions we consider correct, examine our own thoughts, make practical corrections, and improve our ideological understanding. We will also present our opinions and engage in discussion on issues we consider worthy of discussion. In this way, it will be beneficial to the development of correct criticism and self-criticism on the literary and art front, and our level of policy thinking in writing will be improved. Now, we will simply introduce the creation process and past performance feedback of this script, which may be helpful for us to study these issues.
    The incident of "Don't Kill Him" occurred in late February 1947 in the old liberated area of ​​central Hebei. At that time, land had not yet been equally distributed in the countryside, the village branches had not yet been rectified, the People's Liberation War had been fought for eight months, and the enemy was advancing towards Shengfang. At that time, among the troops in the Jin-Cha-Ji region, some people had quite serious "arrogance and self-importance, complaints about local organizations, and complaints about the backwardness of the masses," remnants of warlordism, which led to some serious behaviors that alienated them from the masses. Liu Deming's shooting of the guide was an individual, culminating example of this thinking. The focus of the Military Region's March political work conference was to implement Chairman Mao's military building ideology and correctly resolve the relationship between the army and the local areas, and between the army and the people. The meeting drew clear lines, exposed the class essence of the remnants of warlordism, and resolutely attacked it. It also established the principle of overcoming such thoughts and behaviors: that is, the relationship between the army and the local areas, and between the army and the people, belongs to the internal relations of our revolution. If the relationship is not handled well, the army should be criticized and blamed more. At the same time, the army must first and unconditionally examine itself with a highly serious spirit of self-criticism, and correct its shortcomings or mistakes, in order to effectively overcome the remnants of warlordism and behavior, improve the relationship between the army and the local areas, and between the army and the people, unite as one, and defeat the enemy. Because the army holds guns, if it is not aware of this, it can easily fail to distinguish between the attitude towards the enemy and the attitude towards itself. The shooting of the guide was a serious criminal act caused by failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves in thought. The army leadership at the time took a firm attitude and executed Liu Deming to educate the troops. However, the people of the old liberated areas, due to the nearly ten years of shared life and death and blood ties between the military and the people, had a high degree of class consciousness and loved their own sons and soldiers. Under this major premise, they forgave the warlord Liu Deming and allowed him to atone for his crime by killing the enemy and making meritorious service. This moving concrete fact, in the army's overcoming of the remnants of warlordism, had great persuasiveness and aroused and improved the army's understanding of the essence of the people. "How do the people treat us!" Therefore, it was repeatedly emphasized at the political work conference that our army comrades should remember this bloody lesson and strictly examine themselves in resolving the relationship between the army and the local areas, and between the army and the people.
    As a part of the army's political work, literary and art work, under this principle and task, selected this theme to reflect the theme of the people loving the army and complete the political task of educating the troops, and collected all the materials for "Don't Kill Him." We visited the villages, Party and government leading organs, and masses where the incident occurred, visited the local garrison political department, and especially visited the parents and relatives of the deceased. From these visits, we were educated and further realized the greatness of the people. In mid-April, the Jin-Cha-Ji Southern Line Campaign began. We followed the army to fight on the Zhengtai Railway and visited the troops where this incident occurred. With the help of the leading organs handling this incident, we lived with the vast number of commanders and fighters for a period of time, visited the director of the regiment who personally handled this issue, and visited Liu Deming himself, who was sentenced to imprisonment. From this team's self-examination, handling, and education, it was unanimously believed that the shooting of the guide, although an individual and prominent incident, its essence of warlordism existed quite commonly among our troops for a period of time (precisely because the People's Liberation Army grows and develops in today's specific Chinese society, it is inevitable that it will be infected, to varying degrees, with various incorrect ideological tendencies - the reflection of class struggle within the army, precisely because of this, the People's Army needs its Party and government work, and arduous ideological struggle. The People's Army is constantly developing and advancing in the process of carrying out a series of works and winning these ideological struggles). Subsequently, we successively saw the Bangzi opera "Never Kill Him" written by the 8th Sub-district Cultural Work Team and the "Mother" performed by the 4th Column Vanguard Drama Society with the same theme, absorbed their advantages, collected the reflections of the vast number of commanders and fighters, and wrote "Don't Kill Him" according to the instructions of the leadership.
    Starting from November of the year before last, it was toured among the troops more than 50 times, and each time it received its due effect, with debates, self-examinations, and a few comrades doubting "Are the masses really that good?" But after explanation, they also recognized it and achieved the goal of educating the troops. There was once a company commander with serious warlord thinking who did not listen to criticism from the masses, nor did he understand the criticism from the leadership, but after watching this play, he suddenly understood and corrected himself. When performing for the Liangguang Column, although the language barrier existed, it did not reduce its role. Many comrades wrote reflections on their incorrect views of the people on the very night of the performance. Last May, in Shijiazhuang, performing for 3,000 workers, 1,000 students, and more than 2,000 comrades from the army's organs, we also received the same correct understanding of our military-civilian relationship. In short, the vast number of commanders and fighters believed that this play promoted the military-civilian relations education of the troops, played a positive role in overcoming the remnants of warlordism, and raising class consciousness. Moreover, it has been continuously revised during numerous performances, as well as the reflections of other fraternal drama troupes' performances, and has become what it is now. Of course, it still has some shortcomings in terms of scriptwriting, directing, and acting that need to be further revised, which will not be discussed here.

    “不要杀他”的创作和演出
    流笳
    抗敌剧社“不要杀他”一剧，在文代大会上演出后，引起了—主要是对剧本的主题思想与创作方法上—不少带有原则性的分歧的意见。这些意见，我们愿意以学习的态度倾听它，并继续征求和认真的研究它。我们认为正确的意见，将诚恳接受，检查自己的思想，加以切实的纠正，提高我们的思想认识。我们认为值得商讨的，也将提出我们的意见，展开讨论。这样，对于开展文艺战线上正确的批评与自我批评，会有所收获。对写作上的政策思想水平，会有所提高。现在仅将这个剧本的创作过程，和从前演出的反映，简单地介绍一下，或将对我们研究这些问题，有所帮助。
    “不要杀他”的事件，是发生在一九四七年二月下旬，老解放区的冀中。那时候，乡村还未进行平分土地，村支部还未进行整党，人民解放战争，已打了八个月，敌人正向胜芳进攻。那时候，在晋察冀的部队中，一部分人相当严重地存在着“骄傲居功，抱怨地方组织，抱怨群众落后”的军阀主义残余思想，并产生了一些严重的脱离群众的行为。刘德铭枪杀向导，则是在这种思想支使下的个别的登峰造极的事例。军区三月政治工作会议的中心，就是贯彻毛主席建军思想，正确解决军队与地方、军队与人民关系问题。会上划清了界限，揭露了军阀主义残余思想的阶级本质，坚决打击了它。并确定了克服这种思想行为的原则：即是军队与地方、军队与人民关系，是属于我们革命内部的关系，关系如果搞不好，应着重地更多地批评和责备军队。同时，军队必需首先无条件的以高度严肃的自我批评精神，检讨自己，改正自己的缺点或错误，才能有效地克服军阀主义残余思想行为，改善军队与地方、军队与人民关系，团结一致，战胜敌人。因为军队手里拿着枪，如果稍不觉悟，即容易分不清楚对待敌人和对待自己的态度。枪杀向导这个事件，就是由于思想上没有分清敌我，而造成的严重犯罪行为。军队领导机关，当时采取了坚决的态度，以枪决刘德铭来教育部队。但老解放区的人民，由于将近十年来的军民生死与共、血肉相连的关系，有了高度的阶级觉悟，热爱自己的子弟兵，在这样大前提下，饶恕军阀主义者刘德铭，令他带罪杀敌立功。这个感人的具体事实，就在军队克服军阀主义残余倾向中，带有极大的说服性，唤起和提高军队对人民本质的认识，“人民是怎样对待我们的！”因之，在政治工作会议上，一再强调的指出，要我们军队同志，在解决军队与地方、军队与人民关系中，记住这个血的教训，严格地检查自己。
    做为部队政治工作一部份的文艺工作，就在这个方针和任务下，选取了这个题材，反映人民热爱军队的主题，完成教育部队的政治任务，搜集了“不要杀他”的全部材料。我们访问了发生事件的村庄、党政领导机关和群众，访问了当地驻军政治部，特别访问了死者的父母和亲属；从这些访问中，教育了我们，进一步认识人民的伟大。四月中旬，晋察冀南线战役开始，我们随军转战正太路，又访问了发生这个事件的部队，并由处理这个事件领导机关的帮助，和广大指战员生活了一个时期，访问了亲自处理这个问题的团主任，访问了判处徒刑押在监狱里的刘德铭本人。从这个团队检讨、处理和进行教育当中，一致认为枪杀向导这个事件，虽是个别的突出的，但他的军阀主义残余思想本质，一个时期中却相当普遍地存在我们部队中间（正是因为人民解放军，生长发展在今天中国这样的具体社会中，因此它就不可免地，一定时期或多或少地感染各种不正确的思想倾向——阶级斗争，在军队内部的反映，也正因为这样，人民军队才需要它的党政工作，艰苦的思想斗争。人民军队，就是在进行了一系列的工作，取得这些思想斗争的胜利中，而不断发展前进的）。接着，我们先后看到以同一题材，八分区文工队写的梆子戏“千万不要杀他”和四纵前卫剧社演出的“母亲”，吸收了他们的优点，搜集了广大指战员的反映，根据领导上的指示，写成了“不要杀他”。
    从前年十一月开始，在部队中巡回演出，先后五十几次，每次都收到他应有的效果，有争论、有检讨，也有少数同志怀疑“群众是不是这么好？”但经过说明解释，也就认清了，达到它教育部队的目的。曾经有一个连长，有严重的军阀主义思想，群众批评不听，领导上批评，也没有搞通他的思想，但看了这个戏后，恍然大悟，得到改正。给两广纵队演出时，虽因语言的隔阂，却并未减少他的作用，许多同志，就在演出的当晚，纷纷写了对人民不正确看法的反省。去年五月，在石家庄，给三千工人、一千学生和两千多部队机关同志演出，也同样收到了对于我们军民关系的正确认识。总之，广大指战员，认为这个剧，推动了部队的军民关系教育，起了克服军阀主义残余思想，提高阶级觉悟的积极作用。又在屡次演出当中，得到他们不断的修改，以及其他兄弟剧团演出的反映，成为现在的样子。当然它在编剧上、导演上、演员上还存在若干缺点，需要加以进一步的修正，这里就不谈他了。
          一九四九、七、十二。
