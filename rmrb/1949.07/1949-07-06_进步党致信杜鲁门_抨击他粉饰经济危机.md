　　Progressive Party Writes to Truman
  　Criticizing Him for Glossing Over Economic Crisis
    Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 5th: TASS, New York, July 4th: Baldwin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Progressive Party, published the party's open letter to Truman, criticizing government officials for saying that the US economy "is in a state of prosperity" and that what the American people need is only "confidence." The letter said: These words reveal that government officials consider the increasing number of millions of unemployed people, the doubling of bankruptcies of enterprises in recent months, the continuous seven-month drop in industrial production, and all signs of declining purchasing power, as "insignificant." All of this shows that we have entered the first stage of a fully mature economic crisis.

    The open letter continued: In the coming months, millions more will become unemployed. Relief has become a major issue in industrialized states, and declining agricultural income is also a current problem.

    The Progressive Party put forward some emergency constructions, emphasizing the immediate increase in annual unemployment benefits for all workers, including various workers. It also suggested that the government encourage wage increases rather than price increases, implement public works programs, and have the government purchase and distribute surplus agricultural products, etc.

    The open letter emphasized: "The government must immediately break down trade barriers between East and West, so that American factories can start working and workers have work to do, and supply the goods needed by Eastern Europe and China."

    The Progressive Party's letter demanded the resignation of Secretary of Commerce Sawyer.

　　进步党致信杜鲁门
  　抨击他粉饰经济危机
    【新华社北平五日电】塔斯社纽约四日讯：进步党全国委员会主席鲍尔温发表该党致杜鲁门的公开信。抨击政府官员所说美国经济“正处在繁荣中”，以及什么美国人民所需要的只是“信心”等语。信内说：这些话透露出政府官员把增加着的数百万失业者的惨景，几个月来企业破产的倍增，工业生产连续七个月大跌和购买力降落的一切迹象等，通统认为“无关紧要”。而这一切却都说明着我们已经进入了全面成熟的经济危机的第一阶段。
    公开信继称：在今后几个月之内还会有几百万人失业。救济已成了工业发达各州中的主要问题，而下降着的农业收入，也是一个当前的问题。
    进步党提出一些紧急建设，强调立即增加包括各种工人在内的全年的失业津贴。并建议政府鼓励增加工资而不要提高物价，实行公共工程计划，由政府收购与分配剩余农产品等。
    公开信强调指出：“政府必须立即打破东西间的贸易壁垒，借使美国工厂可以开工，工人有工可做。并供应东欧与中国所需要的货物”。
    进步党的信中要求商务部长沙逸辞战。
