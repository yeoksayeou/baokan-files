Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 13th — Due to continuous heavy rains in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the river has risen sharply, and dangers have occurred in various places. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission's office in Kaifeng is stepping up its supervision of local repairs and defenses, and is mobilizing the masses along the river to make every effort to protect the dikes. Currently, the river water has overflowed the beaches in the Zhongmu section of Henan and the Yunbei section of Shandong. According to measurements taken by the Yellow River Committee on the 8th of this month, the Yellow River water level is two inches higher than the highest water level last year. In the Zhao Kou dangerous works section of Zhongmu, between dams 47 and 55, a beach area of approximately 30 meters in length and 200 meters in width has collapsed due to rapid water erosion. Among them, dams 54 and 55 have successively been inundated. Based on the current water situation, there is still a possibility of the levee subsiding. After receiving the danger warning from the area, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission's office in Kaifeng immediately transported more than 2,000 kilograms each of iron wire and burlap and dispatched personnel to the dangerous area to supervise the rescue efforts. The Zhongmu repair and defense section is also closely cooperating with the local county and district governments to urgently mobilize and organize the masses to transport stones and gather materials for emergency repairs on the dikes. In the Yunbei section, the river water has risen 1.5 meters above the dikes along an 80-li (40 km) stretch of the embankment. People's governments at all levels along the river have fully mobilized the masses to protect the dikes day and night. In order to accurately grasp the Yellow River's water level and flow and to do a good job in this year's flood control work, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission's office in Kaifeng has established water stations in Shanzhou and Huayuankou, and water level stations in Zhao Kou, Heigangkou, Liuyuankou, and Dong Ditou. The flood control work in various counties and repair and defense offices/sections along the river has entered a tense stage and is universally holding meetings to mobilize the masses to guard the dikes day and night.

　　Furthermore, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, with the major Yellow River flood season approaching, issued a prevention and control instruction on the 9th, calling on all counties, repair and defense offices, and all Party, government, military, and civilian personnel along the river to closely unite and struggle to ensure that there are no breaches. The instruction stipulates that flood prevention and control work is one of the most urgent tasks for all areas along the river. Each county and section must be responsible for its own section and focus on defending dangerous works in various locations. If breaches occur and cause major disasters, responsibility will be pursued according to jurisdiction. The instruction calls on local county committees and county governments to ensure the completion of various organizational tasks and the timely supply of manpower and materials. In times of major flood emergencies, county and district cadres should fully mobilize the masses to support the rescue efforts on the dikes, and at the same time, strictly prevent hidden Kuomintang bandits and special agents from sabotaging.

    【新华社开封十三日电】黄河上游连日大雨，河水暴涨，各处相继发生险象，黄河水利委员会驻汴办事处正加紧督导各地修防，并动员沿河群众全力抢护。目前河南中牟段、山东郓北段河水均已漫滩，据黄委会本月八日测量，黄河水位比去年最高水位高出二寸。中牟段赵口险工处四十七坝至五十五坝间，长三十公尺、宽二百公尺左右之滩面被急水冲刷陷塌，其中五十四、五十五两坝已相继着水，根据目前水势来看，堤岸还有下挫可能。黄委会驻汴办事处接到该处险警后，立即运送铁丝、麻料各两千余斤，并派员驰往险地督导抢护。中牟修防段亦密切配合当地县区政府，紧急动员、组织群众运石集料，上堤抢修。郓北段亦有长达八十华里的堤岸，黄水已上堤一点五公尺。沿河各级人民政府已全力动员群众上堤抢护。黄委会驻汴办事处为精确掌握黄河水位、流量，做好今年的防汛工作，已在陕州、花园口两处设立水站，在赵口、黑岗口、柳园口及东堤头等处设水位站。沿河各县、各修防处、段的防汛工作，刻已进入紧张阶段，正普遍召开会议，动员群众上堤日夜守护。
    又中共河南省委会以黄河大期将届，九日发出防预指示，号召沿河各县、各修防处及全体党政军民，密切结合起来，为保证不决口而斗争。指示规定防预工作为目前沿河各地最紧迫的任务之一。各县、段必须分段负责，有重点的防守各处险工。如发生决口酿成巨灾，当依照辖区追究责任。指示号召：各地县委及县政府要保证完成各项组织工作和人力物力的及时供应。大汛紧急时，县区干部应全力动员群众上堤支援抢救，同时应严防隐藏的国民党匪特分子的阴谋破坏。
