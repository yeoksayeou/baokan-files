National Unified Passenger and Freight Transportation and Fare Miscellaneous Charges Rules (Continued and Completed)
　　10. Students who commute to school and live within forty kilometers can purchase student regular passenger tickets, and elementary school students are exempt from ticket prices.
　　11. To facilitate passengers traveling within a certain section, return tickets are provided, with each book containing ten pages. The price of each page is calculated at ten times the ordinary ticket price. Each person uses one page per trip, which is torn off and collected by the destination station.
　　12. Passengers' personal belongings, excluding military equipment, dangerous goods, and unsanitary items, can be brought into the passenger car free of charge if the total weight does not exceed 20 kilograms and the overall volume does not exceed 0.2 cubic meters. If the weight exceeds the aforementioned limit, a fine equivalent to the corresponding parcel freight rate for the distance traveled will be charged for the excess weight.
　　13. To make freight charges reasonable, parcels are divided into four grades for calculating freight: Grade 1 parcels include banknotes, gold and silver, jewelry, and gemstones; Grade 2 parcels include bicycles, musical instruments, and animals; Grade 3 parcels include items not belonging to grades 1, 2, and 4; Grade 4 parcels include fresh fish, shellfish, fresh meat, and fresh vegetables. Furthermore, to encourage the development of production and to take care of the general people's livelihood, daily necessities such as fresh vegetables, fresh meat, fresh milk, and sideline production such as newborn chicks and bees will be charged at 70% of the Grade 4 parcel freight rate.
　　In addition, banknotes transported by the Northeast Bank and the People's Bank will be charged at half the Grade 1 parcel freight rate to prosper the entire national economy.
　　B. Freight Transportation Relations:
　　1. Carload or less-than-carload freight will be mutually handled and transported on the Northeast, Northern, and Southern Railways. However, goods transported using the Yangtze River ferry between Pukou and Nanjing must be approved by the Minister of Railways.
　　2. When the Northeast General Bureau transports goods to and from the Northern and Southern Bureaus, Shanhaiguan Station will be the boundary station. The section from the originating station to Shanhaiguan will be paid by the shipper, and the section from Shanhaiguan to the destination station will be paid by the consignee. Freight charges will be collected separately by the originating and destination stations.
　　3. Freight rates will be progressively reduced with distance. Examples are as follows:
　　Example: Freight rates from Beijing West Station to Tianjin North Station, Pukou, and Hankou.
　　Originating Station　Beijing West Station　Beijing West Station　Beijing West Station　Beijing West Station　Beijing West Station　Beijing West Station
　　Destination Station　Tianjin North Station　Tianjin North Station　Pukou　Pukou　Hankou　Hankou
　　Type of Handling　Carload　Less-than-carload　Carload　Less-than-carload　Carload　Less-than-carload

　　Difference %　0.2　19.5　19.5　19.5　33.7　33.7
　　4. When the railway weighs the goods on behalf of the shipper, a weighing fee will be charged. However, if the shipper weighs the goods themselves and can guarantee the accuracy of the weight, no weighing fee will be charged.
　　5. When the shipper sends an escort for goods handled by carload, one person per car is free of charge. For each additional person, half of the ordinary passenger ticket price will be charged as an escort fee.
　　6. The shipper must plan properly to avoid temporary changes in the destination of goods being transported to a certain station, in order to save transportation capacity. If the shipper requests a change at the originating or destination station (intermediate stations will not be accepted), in addition to the change fee, a fine of RMB 2,280 yuan (Northeast currency 250,000 yuan) per car will be charged for carload freight.
　　7. To avoid wasting vehicles, less-than-carload transportation will not be provided for livestock such as cattle, horses, donkeys, and camels. Less-than-carload transportation will also not be provided for coffins and remains.
　　8. When the cargo owner loads and unloads the freight car themselves, loading and unloading must be completed within four hours from the time the freight car is moved to the loading and unloading location. If the time exceeds four hours, a freight car delay fee will be charged for the excess time.
　　9. After the goods arrive at the destination station, they will be announced immediately on the bulletin board. If the cargo owner applies for notification in advance, the railway will notify them by telephone, letter, or by sending a special person. In this case, a telephone fee of RMB 30 yuan (Northeast currency 3,000 yuan) per call, a letter notification fee of RMB 50 yuan (Northeast currency 5,000 yuan) per letter, and a special person notification fee will be charged at actual cost.
　　The consignee must collect the goods within the following periods from the time the railway issues the arrival notice, otherwise a cargo storage fee will be charged.
　　1. Valuables, corpses, and animals: 6 hours.
　　2. Dangerous goods (excluding gunpowder): 8 hours.
　　3. Other goods: 24 hours from 0:00 the day after notification.
