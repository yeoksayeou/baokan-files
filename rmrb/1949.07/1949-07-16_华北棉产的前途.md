The Future of Cotton Production in North China
Shu Lianying

In order to quickly achieve the goal of providing the people with sufficient food and clothing, the future development of agriculture should not be based on a single region or province being self-sufficient. Instead, it should be planned on a national scale, determining where it is most suitable to grow grain and where it is most suitable to grow cotton, so that it aligns with the local climate, soil, farming systems, economic conditions, etc., allowing for unimpeded development. Then, each region can exchange what they have for what they lack, adjusting surpluses and deficits, and each will receive the food and cotton they need. This is undoubtedly a more efficient approach. North China is the most suitable region for cotton production in China and has an important relationship with the future of China's cotton industry. The advantages and development prospects of cotton production in North China are described as follows:

I. The Superior Position of Cotton Planting in North China in the Country

The main cotton producing areas in the country are in the North China and Central China regions; the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest have very small quantities. (The North China region includes the five old provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi. North China generally does not include Shaanxi. The Central China region includes the seven old provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan.) The producing areas in the Northeast are in the Liaohe, Dalinghe, and Liaodong Bay areas of Liaoning. The producing areas in the Northwest are in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu and the counties of Turpan, Shache, Shanshan, Shule, and Hotan in Xinjiang. The producing areas in the Southwest are scattered cotton-producing areas in the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Xikang. The Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest are limited by factors such as cold, drought, high altitude, mountains, rain, and pests; they can be used for emergencies, but not for long-term production. The following only compares the differences between North China and Central China.

1.  The cotton field area and lint cotton output of the five provinces in North China are evenly matched with the seven provinces in Central China domestically. Normal figures can be represented by the statistics from 1932 to 1937. The cotton field area in North China accounted for 49% of the country, and the lint cotton output accounted for 53% of the country. The lint cotton output per mu in North China was 23.7 jin, while it was 21 jin in Central China. This is enough to prove that cotton production in North China accounts for half of the country, and the yield per mu is higher than that of Central China. If we calculate it ten years earlier, the average figures from 1922 to 1927 show that the cotton field area in the five provinces of North China only accounted for 36.6% of the country. Central China, which did not include Hunan and Sichuan in the statistics at that time, accounted for 63.4% of the country with only five provinces. This further proves that there was no major increase or decrease in Central China after ten years, while the cotton field in North China increased rapidly.

2.  The increase or decrease of cotton planting area in North China before the War of Resistance Against Japan was parallel to whether cotton planting was beneficial. For example, the area in Hebei Province decreased year by year from 1919 to 1931. In 1932, it suddenly increased due to the emphasis on cotton production improvement and the promotion of American cotton. After 1924, the area in Shandong Province increased rapidly due to the development of the textile industry in Qingdao and the high demand for American cotton. The cotton field area in Central China has always maintained a certain number of mu, and the annual increase or decrease is purely due to changes in the climate conditions of that year. This is enough to prove that cotton planting in North China has gradually become commercialized. As long as the sales are good and the price is high, its area can be increased at any time, and it has broken away from the category of self-sufficiency.

3.  The climate in North China is suitable for cotton planting. The temperature gradually increases after sowing and gradually decreases during the maturity period, which conforms to the growth habits of cotton. The only disadvantage is the uneven distribution of rainfall. 70% of the annual rainfall occurs in June, July, and August, while there is little rain and snow in winter and spring. Therefore, North China only suffers from spring drought. In years of drought, the cotton fields that have been sown and then abandoned are always between 1 million and 4 million mu. In Central China, autumn rain is a disaster, often reducing the quality and yield of cotton. However, the spring drought in North China can be turned into a complete cotton planting area by digging canals and wells and using artificial methods to remedy it. For example, in the counties near Shijiazhuang, the existence of wells can be judged from the cotton growth in the fields; the height of the groundwater level can also be inferred from the existence of wells; and the suitable area for cotton planting can be inferred from the distribution of groundwater. The success or failure of cotton planting in this area completely depends on irrigation. As for the autumn rain in Central China, it is not easy to remedy it with artificial methods at present.

4.  Planting American cotton in North China is a "one-year heat," but compared with the two-year, three-crop system of food crops, each mu can earn an extra five to seven yuan before the war. As a result, it invaded the area of food crops, first from lower fields to middle fields, and first from millet and sorghum land with one crop a year to land with two crops in three years. Rice and wheat in Central China have two crops a year, with high yields. Even if native cotton is combined with barley, naked barley, or broad beans, it can also have two crops, but it cannot keep pace with rice and wheat. In addition, the coastal land in Jiangyin Pudong originally planted American cotton, but later the cotton field was reduced because soybeans and wheat can be combined into two crops a year, and the amount of soybeans imported into Shanghai from the Northeast was also reduced. Due to the strong competition of crops, the cotton field area in Central China is not easy to increase naturally. Unless in the Huainan Salt Reclamation Area, where there is no competition from other crops and a lot of American cotton is planted in strongly alkaline areas; or cotton is automatically rotated once after planting rice for three to five years, without fertilization, and using its deep roots to absorb fertilizer from the deep soil; or the cotton field area is occasionally increased when it is dry and not suitable for rice.

5.  In order to meet the needs of spinning mills, more American cotton should be planted. The percentage of American cotton area in North China was 56.4 in 1924, 56.7 in 1932, and reached 68.5 in 1936, gradually replacing native cotton. In Central China, it was 43.6 in 1924, 43.3 in 1932, and 31.5 in 1936. This is enough to prove that the development of changing to American cotton in North China is very fast, while American cotton in Central China cannot replace the local native cotton. Because the native cotton in Central China can still be planted with winter crops after being harvested at the end of October. American cotton only has the advantage of high yield, but due to the uncertainty of harvest due to autumn rain, the income is still not as good as the two-crop system of native cotton land. As for the native cotton in Central China, it has many other advantages: 1. It has strong resistance to leaf curl worms, aphids, and leaf curl disease. 2. It has a high ginning percentage. 3. It is resistant to rain, with less boll rot and stiff petals. 4. Regardless of the success or failure of the autumn harvest, there is still the harvest of winter crops to support it.

Therefore, the favorable conditions in North China are: cotton planting has been commercialized, its climate is suitable, the yield per mu is the highest in the country, there are no competing crops, and it is suitable for planting American cotton.

II. The Future of Cotton Production in North China

According to estimates: the annual amount of cotton used for machine spinning in the four provinces of North China (the pseudo includes sources that do not include Shaanxi) is 2.75 million dan, the amount of cotton used for hand spinning is 500,000 dan, and the amount of cotton used for wadding is an average of one jin per person per year, which is 1 million dan for the 100 million population of North China, totaling 4.25 million dan. Assuming that the cotton field in North China produces 23.6 jin of lint cotton per mu (the average yield per mu of cotton field in the country from 1919 to 1937), there should be 18 million mu of cotton fields. However, according to the survey of the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government, the cotton field area in North China in 1948 was only 7.74 million mu (although it did not include the areas under Chiang Kai-shek's control at that time). To achieve self-sufficiency, the cotton field must be increased by at least one time. Can this number be reached? If we look back, we know that the total cotton field of the four provinces in 1936 had reached 23 million mu, and it even reached a record high of 28 million mu in 1937, which is more than the hoped-for 18 million mu. The climax of those two years was the accidental success of the combination of politics, society, and economy. In the future, the country will be liberated, the people's livelihood will be restored, transportation will be convenient, spinning mills will resume work, and foreign cotton will be restricted. Its superior conditions should be above 1936 to 1937, and it is not difficult for a rapid advance in cotton production to reappear.

Since North China is an excellent cotton-producing area, in order to give full play to the effectiveness of the planned economy in the future, it is not difficult for the five provinces of North China to bear the amount of cotton production that is insufficient in the country. According to estimates: the country needs 11 million dan of cotton for machine spinning, 2.4 million dan of cotton for hand spinning, and 4.5 million dan of cotton for wadding per year, totaling 18 million dan. If the cotton field produces 23.6 jin of cotton per mu, the country needs 76 million mu of cotton field. Assuming that the cotton field in Central China strives to recover to 28 million mu before the war, the five provinces in North China should bear the remaining 48 million mu. In 1937, the cotton field in the five provinces of North China had reached 32 million mu. After North China recovers to 32 million mu, it only needs to increase by 16 million mu to complete the mission.

However, in terms of agricultural administration, we should prevent the occurrence of insufficient food, lack of fertilizer, and the phenomenon of cheap cotton and expensive grain that may be caused by strengthening cotton development. The countermeasures should pay attention to: 1. Estimate the area of cotton fields occupied by food crop cultivation in various places each year, and plan to transport sufficient grain from grain-producing provinces to support. 2. Strive to facilitate transportation and speed up procurement. In addition to the cotton used in North China, it is necessary to quickly purchase and transfer it to cotton-deficient provinces to facilitate farmers' purchase of grain. 3. To remedy the lack of fertilizer, the first is to advocate the manufacture of ammonium sulfate. Its fertilizer efficiency is rapid and transportation is convenient. As a result of its implementation in North China for 20 years, it has been accepted by farmers. Before the war, only Yongli Chemical Factory produced ammonium sulfate, with an annual output of 100 million jin. During the war, the Japanese enemy's chemical industry in the Northeast had an annual output of 480 million jin, and the byproduct of Mantetsu had an annual output of 60 million jin. If this manufacturing equipment can be restored, it will be enough to meet the needs of the increased cotton field by applying 10 jin per mu.

In addition, increasing land yield is also most possible under the climate and soil conditions of North China. According to the most prudent estimates: digging canals and wells can increase yield by 40% to 50%, increasing fertilizer application can increase yield by 20% to 30%, preventing and controlling diseases and insects can increase yield by 15% to 25%, and improving cultivation methods can increase yield by 10% to 20%, totaling about a doubling of yield. This is a topic that has not been fully done before and should be vigorously promoted in the future. In this way, the cotton field in North China will be reduced back to 24 million mu, which can also make up for the insufficient cotton production in the country.

Although these prospects need to be realized from the efforts in the future, there is no doubt that North China should be designated as the concentrated cotton planting area in China to take on the overall base of cotton production in the country.

    华北棉产的前途
    舒联莹
    为了迅速完成人民大众的足衣足食，今后发展农业的方式，似乎不再是计划一区一省的自给自足，而是计划全国各地带，何处宜多种粮食，何处宜多种棉花，使它与当地气候、土质、耕作制度、经济状况等相配合，无阻碍的发展下去，然后使各地以有易无，调剂盈虚，各自得到所需要的食粮与棉花。这当然是事半功倍的做法。华北是中国棉产最适宜的地带，对中国棉业前途有重要关系，现将华北棉产优点及发展前途分述如次：
    一、华北植棉在全国的优越地位
    全国产棉地带主要在华北华中两区；东北、西北、西南则数量甚微。（华北区包括河北、山东、河南、山西、陕西五个旧省制，一般称华北多不包括陕西。华中区包括江苏、浙江、安徽、江西、湖南、湖北、四川七个旧省制。）东北的产地在辽宁的辽河大凌河及辽东湾一带。西北的产地在甘肃的河西走廊及新疆的吐鲁番、莎车、鄯善、疏勒、和阗等县。西南的产地在云、贵、两广、福建、西康各省有零星产棉区。东北、西北、西南不是因为寒旱高的影响，就是受多山多雨多虫的限制；以之应急则可，以之持久是不可能的。以下仅比较华北与华中的差异。
    １、华北五省的棉田面积和皮棉产量，与华中七省在国内是平分秋色的。平时而正常的数字，可用一九三二至一九三七年的统计来代表，华北棉田面积占全国百分之四九，皮棉产量占全国百分之五三。而每亩皮棉产量，华北是二十三·七斤，华中是二十一斤。这足以证明华北棉产为全国之半数，每亩产量则较华中为高。再试提前十年一算，一九二二至一九二七年的平均数字，华北五省棉田面积仅占全国百分之三十六·六，华中当时未将湖南、四川统计在内，仅只五省即占全国百分之六十三·四，这更证明十年之后，华中没有大增减，而华北棉田则迅速增进了。
    ２、华北植棉面积的增减，在抗日战争前是与植棉有利与否相平行的。如河北省自一九一九年至一九三一年的十三年中逐年减少，至一九三二年因注重棉产改进同时推广美棉而突增。山东省自一九二四年以后，因青岛纺织业发展，美棉需要量多而迅速增加。华中棉田面积则经常保持一定的亩数，每年的增减，纯因该年气候状态而变更。这足以证明华北的植棉已逐渐商品化，只要销路好，售价高，它的面积随时可以增加，而是脱离了自给自足的范畴的。
    ３、华北气候适宜植棉，气温自播种后逐渐增高，到成熟期又逐渐降低，均符合棉花的生育习性。唯一缺点在雨量分配不匀，全年雨量百分之七十在六七八三个月降落，而冬季春季雨雪都少，所以华北只有春旱为灾。一遇旱年，已经播种而又废弃的棉田总在一百万至四百万亩之间。华中则秋季雨多为灾，常致减低棉花品质及产量。但华北的春旱如经开渠凿井，以人为方法去挽救，即可变为完整无缺的植棉地带。如石家庄附近各县，因凿井发达，可自田间棉花生育情况判断井之有无；自井之有无也可推知其地下水位之高低；又自地下水之分布可推知其适宜植棉之面积。其地植棉之成败，竟完全视灌溉与否而转移。至华中的秋雨，在目前则不易用人为方法补救。
    ４、华北种植美棉是一年一热，但与食粮作物的二年三熟相比，在抗战前每亩可多得五至七元的盈余。于是它侵占食粮的面积是先由下田而至中田，先由一年一熟的粟及高粱地而至二年三熟地。华中稻麦是一年二熟，收益颇丰，即使中棉配合大麦稞麦或蚕豆也能二熟，但不能同稻麦并驾齐驱。又江阴浦东的滨海地原植美棉，后因大豆与小麦可以配合一年二熟而使棉田减少，并缩减了东北输入上海大豆的数量。因了竞争作物的势力强大，华中棉田面积是不易自然增加的。除非如淮南盐垦区强硷地带，没有其他作物竞争而多种美棉；或稻田种植三五年后自动换种一次棉花，不施肥而利用它的深根吸收深土的肥料；或在天旱不宜种稻的时候，偶然地增加了棉田面积。
    ５、为了配合纱厂的需要，应多种美棉。而美棉面积分布的百分数，华北在一九二四年为五十六·四，一九三二年为五十六·七，一九三六年达六十八·五。逐渐替代了中棉。华中在一九二四年为四十三·六，一九三二年为四十三·三，一九三六年为三十一·五。足以证明华北改种美棉发展甚速，而华中的美棉并不能替代当地中棉。因为华中的中棉，十月底收获后还赶得上冬作下种，美棉只有一个产量多的优点，但因秋雨收成不定，收益仍抵不过中棉地的二熟制。至于华中的中棉另有许多优点：１、抵抗卷叶虫、蚜虫、缩叶病的力量强，２、衣分高，３、能抗雨，烂铃、僵瓣少。４、碰到秋雨不论收成优劣，尚有冬作的收获为之支援。
    所以华北的有利条件是：植棉已商品化，它的气候适宜，每亩产量居全国最高位，无竞争作物，而且适种美棉。
    二、华北棉产的前途
    据估计：华北四省（伪迁就资料来源未包括陕西），每年机纺用棉是二百七十五万担，手纺用棉是五十万担，胎絮用棉是每人每年平均一斤，华北一亿人口即一百万担，总数为四百二十五万担。设华北棉田每亩产皮棉以二十三·六斤计（一九一九年至一九三七年的全国棉田每亩平均产量），应有棉田一千八百万亩。但据华北人民政府农业部的调查，一九四八年华北棉田面积仅七百七十四万亩（虽未包括当时蒋管区的地带），要图自给自足，至少须使棉田增加一倍。这个数目能否达到？如果一回顾已往，就知一九三六年四省棉田合计，已曾达到二千三百万亩，一九三七年更达到二千八百万亩的最高纪录，都比希望的一千八百万亩还多。那两年的高潮是政治社会经济配合的偶然成功。今后全国解放，民困复苏，交通便利，纱厂复工，外棉复限制人口数量，其优越条件，应在一九三六至一九三七年之上，不难使棉产的突飞猛进再度出现。
    华北既为优良的产棉地带，将来为发挥计划经济的效能，全国棉产不足数量，即单独由华北五省负担，亦并非难事。据估计：全国机纺年需棉一千一百万担，手纺年需棉二百四十万担，胎絮用棉年需四百五十万担，三共一千八百万市担之谱。棉田每亩产棉以二十三·六斤计，则全国需棉田七千六百万亩。假定华中棉田努力恢复至战前的二千八百万亩为止，则华北五省应负担其余的四千八百万亩。一九三七年华北五省棉田已达三千二百万亩，华北恢复至三千二百万亩以后，再增加者不过一千六百万亩即可完成使命。
    不过在农政方面，应防范因加强棉花发展可能引起的食粮不足，肥料缺乏及棉贱粮贵的现象发生。其对策应注意：１、估计各地每年棉田侵占食粮耕种之面积，有计划地从产粮省份运到足用的粮食以为支援。２、交通力求便利，收购力求迅速，除华北自用棉花外，要迅速收购转运至缺棉省份，以利农民购备粮食。３、补救肥料的不足，首在倡导硫酸＠的制造。它的肥效迅速，运送轻便，在华北推行二十年的结果，已被农民接受。硫酸＠在战前仅有永利化学工厂一家，年产一亿市斤。战时日敌在东北的化学工业年产四万八千万斤，满铁的副产年产六千万斤。此项制造设备倘能恢复，则每亩施用以十斤计，足供增加的棉田之需。
    此外增进土地产量，在华北气候土质下亦最有可能。据最妥慎的估计：开渠凿井可增产量百分之四十至五十，增施肥料可增产量百分之二十至三十，防治病虫可增产量百分之十五至二十五，改善栽培方法可增产量百分之一十至二十，总计可增产量一倍左右。这是以前并未充分做到而为今后应以大力推动的课题，如此将使华北棉田缩回到二千四百万亩，同样能补济全国不足的棉产。
    这些远景，虽然要从今后努力的程度来实现，但把华北划定为中国集中植棉地带，以之担当全国棉花产地的总基地，则是无可置疑的。
