　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 9th: Moscow Dispatch: A representative conference of mass organizations and scientific groups, initiated by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Union of Soviet Writers, and the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, was held here on the 7th. Over a hundred representatives from all walks of life attended. The conference was opened by the writer Tikhonov. He declared: The movement of millions of people to defend peace is becoming increasingly widespread. The role played by the Soviet Union in the struggle for the fate of progressive humanity is well known to people in the most remote corners of the world. The Soviet Union is the main and most powerful defender of oppressed nations, the liberator of peoples under fascist rule, and the loyal guardian of the cause of peace. The Soviet people are not afraid of threats, and no threats of atomic warfare, chemical warfare, or biological warfare can frighten us. On behalf of the Soviet Writers' Association, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, and the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, Tikhonov proposed the establishment of an All-Soviet Committee for the Support of Peace Congress. He pointed out that the convening of the All-Soviet Peace Congress will make a significant contribution to the cause of further struggle for peace. In conclusion, Tikhonov said: Inevitable defeat awaits the warmongers.
　　Academician Vavilov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Popova, Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, also spoke successively, warmly supporting the above proposal. Finally, the conference unanimously elected the preparatory committee for convening the All-Soviet Peace Supporters Congress, including: Korneichuk, Chairman of the Ukrainian Soviet Writers' Association; Simonov, Deputy Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Association; Vavilov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences; Fadeyev, Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Association; Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions; Mikhailov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lenin Communist Youth League; Popova, Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee; writer Tikhonov; composer Shostakovich and other prominent figures.
