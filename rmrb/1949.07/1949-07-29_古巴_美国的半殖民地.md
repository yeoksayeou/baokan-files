　　Cuba - A Semi-Colony of the United States
    By Luoqifu, translated by Feng Peijie

    The Cuban coat of arms depicts a sea illuminated by the rising sun, with a palm tree projected against a mountainous backdrop. But it would probably be more fitting if this small island republic used a stalk of sugarcane and a piece of tobacco leaf as its coat of arms, because for many years, the lifeline of this country has depended on these two plants.

    When you arrive in Havana, this fact will immediately and deeply strike your mind. On the streets of this capital, there are huge electric signs and flashing lights praising the merits of Cuban sugar everywhere. In the cinemas, before the latest Hollywood blockbusters are screened, moving advertisements are shown by various tobacco and sugar companies, urging people to buy sugar and smoke cigars. Sugar companies tell the Cuban people that sugar can replace all kinds of food. If you turn on the radio and tune into a Havana station, you will surely hear the broadcaster's charming voice between two opera performances, praising the quality of the sugar produced by the Cuban-American Sugar Company and the tobacco of the Vietas Company. Things have developed to such an extent that sugar and tobacco have become the subjects of poetry, skits, and even dramas.

    The consistent policy of Cuba's rulers, whether domestic or foreign, has turned this island nation into a two-crop country. This small island is the main sugarcane producing area and the largest sugarcane exporter, accounting for one-fifth of the world's sugarcane industry. Its harvest in 1948 reached six million tons.

    Cuba is the second largest tobacco producer in Latin America; although its output is not large in the world, Cuban tobacco has a solid position in the world market. The word "Havana" has been associated with expensive cigars for many years. Before the war, Cuba produced more than 22 million kilograms of tobacco annually, and today it has reached 33.7 million kilograms.

    Sugarcane fields begin on the outskirts of Havana and are connected to many orchards and tobacco planting areas. Sugarcane constitutes a feature of the Cuban landscape. Mature sugarcane, crowned with lush leaves, forms a solid wall, towering above people.

    Every early summer, hundreds of thousands of people, carrying long knives, cut down the sugarcane and load it onto large carts, and then this long line of carts transports the sugarcane to the train station or directly to the factory. Throughout this republic, warehouses filled with these famous Cuban sugars and Cuban tobaccos are a common sight.

    By turning Cuba into a large sugar refinery and tobacco factory, American capital has seized control of the entire economy of this island nation. Most of Cuba's natural wealth belongs to American monopoly capitalists, and Cuban landlords and manufacturers are at the mercy of these monopoly capitalists.

    In 1940, American investment in Cuba reached 560 million US dollars; by 1946, it had increased to 785 million US dollars, accounting for nearly a quarter of total American investment in Latin America.

    Cuban sugar, when it is still sugarcane in the field, can be said to belong to American and Cuban-American joint ventures. American businesses control Cuba's economy and politics through these companies. Sugar refineries controlled by the United States account for more than two-thirds of sugar production, and the total investment of Cuban national capital in the sugar industry accounts for only less than one-fifth.

    The United States is the largest exporter and re-exporter of Cuban sugar. During the period from 1942 to 1945, Cuba sold all of its sugar to the United States, and only recently began to engage in small-scale independent operations.

    As a result of being a colonial dependency of the United States, Cuba is completely dependent on American monopoly capitalists. Slight fluctuations in the North American market will immediately affect the economy of this island nation. In pursuit of their selfish profits, monopoly capitalists have recently brought Cuba to the brink of economic collapse.

    For example, in June 1947, Washington stipulated a quota limiting sugar imports. According to this decision, sugar imports should not exceed 28.6% of the total domestic demand. Until then, Cuba supplied 55% of the sugar needed by the United States. One can imagine how serious the damage to the Cuban sugar industry was.

    Soon after, the American authorities dealt another blow to Cuba, refusing to pre-order all of the 1948 sugarcane. This put the Cuban industry in even more trouble, and thus began serious unemployment.

    Tobacco leaves have also been severely hit by American monopoly capitalists. Before 1947, the United States purchased almost 90% of Cuba's total tobacco exports, but in 1947, it almost halved the import volume. Other customers of Cuban tobacco, such as Argentina, Portugal, and Uruguay, have also greatly reduced import volumes. Britain has completely stopped buying tobacco from dollar area countries. As a result, Cuban tobacco exports fell from 55.8 million US dollars in 1946 to 34.6 million US dollars in 1947. Cuba has been unable to find a market for tobacco leaves, and its spot goods accumulated to 26 million kilograms in mid-1948, almost equal to its annual output.

    American monopoly capitalists are indifferent to the terrible consequences that their policy of controlling Cuban exports has given to Cuba, but they pay close attention to all efforts by the Cuban government to extricate itself from its economic predicament. When the Havana newspaper Hoy published a message saying that Cuba and Argentina had begun negotiations in mid-'48 regarding the shipping of meat from Argentina to Cuba, the US commercial representative in Havana immediately visited the leaders of the Cuban government, claiming that his government did not approve of this negotiation. Several days later, it was reported that the Argentine meat shipment had been cancelled, the reason given being that Argentine cattle had suddenly contracted some disease.

    Cuba has no manufacturing industry to speak of. In order to make Cuba's economy permanently dependent on them, American manufacturers flooded the Cuban market with large quantities of cheap and inferior mass-produced goods. Local factories were forced to close down because they could not compete with them. In the autumn of 1948, under pressure from Washington, the Cuban government abolished the last regulation restricting the import of American textiles.

    American tycoons who come to Cuba for rest and recreation regard this island nation as their own. They don't even think it is necessary to hide their contempt for the Cuban people, whom they regard as an inferior race.

    Therefore, the way Americans seek pleasure in Havana is also special. In order to seek stimulation, these tourists who are tired of ordinary things do not hesitate to relax their tired minds by engaging in fights with sharks. Many times, a drunken tourist wanders to the seaside and takes out one hundred pesos (local currency name) to the fishermen and dockworkers gathered on the shore, offering it to anyone who dares to jump into the sea with a knife and kill a shark. However, these fights often do not end satisfactorily. Often the result of these one hundred pesos is the life of a poor man.

    No wonder the local residents have no good feelings about these "rich customers" from the United States. In shops, on the streets, one can often hear criticisms that hate Americans.

    The word "Yankee" is actually a curse in the mouths of the Cuban people.

　　古巴——美国的半殖民地
    洛楚夫著  冯培节译
    古巴的国徽描出一个为朝阳照亮的海，以一棵棕树投影于群山的背景上。但是这个小小的共和岛国如果用一茎甘蔗和一块烟叶来作国徽的话，那恐怕会更合适些，因为许多年来，这个国家的命脉都赖于这两种植物上。
    当你抵达哈瓦那的时候，这个事实便会马上深深的打进你底脑子。在这个国都的街上，处处都有巨大的电气招牌和流动电光赞扬着古巴糖的美点。在电影院里，最新的好莱坞名片开映之前，登出了各烟草及糖公司底请人买糖和吸雪茄的动人广告。制糖的公司对古巴的人民说，糖是可以代替所有各种食物的。假如你打开无线电收取哈瓦那电台的广播，那你一定可以在两次歌剧中间听到广播员底娓娓动听之音，在赞扬着古美糖公司所产之糖和维埃尔他公司之烟的质料是如何的好。事物之发展已到如此境地，以至糖和烟均已成为诗歌、短剧甚至戏剧的题材了。
    古巴的统治者，无论是国内的抑或是外国的，其不变的政策已把这个岛国变成了一个两种农作物的国家。这小岛是主要的产蔗地和最大的甘蔗输出地，在世界的甘蔗业上，它占了五分之一。它在一九四八年的收成达六百万吨。
    古巴是拉丁美洲第二个最大的产烟地；虽然在世界上它的产量不算大，然而古巴烟在世界市场上是有巩固地位的。“Ｈａｖａｎａ”（按：本为古巴首都之名，但此处指的是雪茄烟的一个流行牌子—译者）这个字很多年来都是与价昂的雪茄有联系的。战前古巴每年产烟二千二百万公斤以上，而在今天则已达三千三百七十万公斤了。
    甘蔗园在哈瓦那市郊就开始，与很多果园和植烟区连在一块，甘蔗构成了古巴风景线的一个特征。成熟的甘蔗冠以茂盛的叶子，形成一巩固的墙，高出人上。
    每年夏初，数十万人带着长的快刀把甘蔗砍下装上大车，然后这长长的大车行列，便把甘蔗送到火车站或直接运到工厂。在这个共和国的全国各地，装满这些有名的古巴糖和古巴烟的仓库，触目皆是。
    　　　　　　　　▲　　　　　　　▲　　　　　　　▲
    使古巴变成一个大炼糖厂和制烟厂，美国资本即借之而掌握了这个岛国的全部经济。古巴底自然财富的大部是属于美国的独占资本家的，古巴的地主和制造商都听命于这些独占资本家。
    一九四○年，美国在古巴的投资达五万万六千万美元；到一九四六年则增至七万万八千五百万美元，几占美国在拉丁美洲投资总数的四分之一。
    古巴糖，当其还是地里的甘蔗时，已可说是属于美国和古美合资的公司的了。美商经过这些公司而操纵了古巴的经济和政治。美国控制的炼糖厂占有糖产量的三分之二以上，古巴的国家资本在糖业上的全部投资，仅占五分之一弱。
    美国是古巴糖的最大输出者和再输出者。在一九四二至一九四五这个期间，古巴把她所有的糖全部卖给美国，而直至最近才着手作小规模的独立经营。
    作为一个殖民地的依附于美国的结果，古巴已完全仰息于美国的独占资本家。北美市场上的些微波动会立即影响这个岛国的经济，为了追求其自私的营利，独点资本家最近使古巴濒于经济崩溃的境地。
    例如一九四七年六月，华盛顿规定了一个限制糖入口的数额。根据这个决定，糖的进口不得超过国内所需总数之二八·六％。直到当时，美国所需之糖有五五％是由古巴供给的，从此则可想象到此举加于古巴糖业的损害是多么严重的了。
    继之不久，美国当局对古巴又作了一次打击，它拒绝了预订购买一九四八的全部甘蔗。这使古巴的工业更陷于困境，因而开始了严重的失业现象。
    烟叶亦受到美国独占资本家的重大打击。在一九四七年以前，美国几收购了古巴烟出口总额之九○％，但到一九四七即将入口额几乎减了一半。古巴烟的其他顾客如阿根廷、葡萄牙及乌拉圭亦大大地缩小了入口额。英国则完全停止向美元地区的国家购烟。结果，古巴烟之出口从一九四六年之五五八○万美元在一九四七年跌至三四六○万美元。古巴已无法找得一个烟叶的市场，其现货在一九四八年中积至二千六百万公斤，几等于其每年的产量。
    美国独占资本家，对于他们控制古巴的输出之政策所给予古巴的可怕的结果，淡然无动于中，但对于古巴政府企图解脱其经济困境的一切努力，却极其注意。当哈瓦那报纸Ｈｏｙ刊登一个消息说，古巴和阿根廷有关从阿运肉到古巴的协商，已在四八年年中开始时，美国驻哈的商务代表立即往见古巴政府的领导人，声称他的政府对此协商不表赞同。数日后即有报导称阿根廷肉运一事已取销，其所举的理由为阿根廷的牛突染某种疾病。
    古巴是没有制造工业可言的。为了使古巴的经济永久依附于他们，美国制造商以大量价廉质劣的大量生产货物充斥于古巴的市场。当地的工厂因不能与其竞争而被迫歇业。一九四八年秋，在华盛顿的压力下，古巴政府废除了最后一条限制美国纺织物入口的规定。
    到古巴来休息和寻乐的美国阔佬把这个岛国看成是他们的。他们甚至认为无需把他们对古巴人民的蔑视隐藏起来，他们把古巴人民视作劣种的异族。
    因而美国人在哈佛那的寻乐方法也是特殊的。为了寻求刺激，这些对普通事物已厌烦的游客不惜借入和鲨鱼的搏斗来轻松轻松他们底疲倦的脑根。很多时，一个酒后的游客漫步至海滨，向群集于岸上的渔民和码头工人拿出一百比沙（按：当地货币名—译者），给敢拿一把刀跳进海中杀死一条鲨鱼的人。然而这些搏斗结果往往却不是圆满的。常常这一百比沙的结果却是穷人的一条生命。
    无怪当地居民对这些来自美国的“富客”都无好感了。在铺子里、在街上、很多时候可听到一些痛恨美国人的批评。
    “Ｙａｎｋｅｅ”这个字在古巴人民的口中实际上就是个咒语。
