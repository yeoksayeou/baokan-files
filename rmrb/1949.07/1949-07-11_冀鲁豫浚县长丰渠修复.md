　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Junxian Changfeng Canal Restored
　　▲The Changfeng Canal in Junxian, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, which is more than seventy li long and irrigates 360,000 mu of wheat fields, has been completely restored under the leadership of the People's Government by the people of five districts after seven days of hard work. There are 3,600 hectares of land along both banks of the canal, which yielded bumper wheat harvests every year before the war and did not require fertilization. Due to the destruction by the Japanese invaders and puppet regime, the canal was in disrepair, and villages along the canal suffered from floods repeatedly. The democratic government then actively led the masses to repair the canal and increase production, and formed a county canal repair committee to specifically divide the work. Construction began on June 12. In the five districts along the canal, the daily labor force reached 9,098 people, who could dig 460 zhang and 7 chi of canal. The masses were in high spirits, and they went to work before dawn and worked in water up to their waists until dark before leaving work. As a result, the entire project was completed in seven days.

　　冀鲁豫浚县长丰渠修复
    ▲长七十余里，灌溉三十六万亩麦地之冀鲁豫浚县长丰渠，在人民政府领导下，五个区的群众，经过七天努力，已全部修复。沿该渠两岸有三千六百顷地，战前年年麦子丰收，且不用施肥。由于日寇及顽伪的破坏，渠道失修，沿渠村庄屡受水灾。民主政府遂积极领导群众修渠增产，组成县修渠委员会，具体分工，于六月十二日动工，沿渠五个区，每日出工达九千零九十八个，可挖渠四百六十丈七公尺。群众情绪非常高涨，大伙子天不明即上工，在深达腰际的水内一直工作到天黑才下工。因之全部工程七天即告完成。
