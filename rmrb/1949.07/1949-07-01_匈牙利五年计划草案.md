　　Hungary's Five-Year Plan Draft
    Translated by Wang Yu
    Recently, at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Workers' Party held in Budapest, Comrade Rakosi, the General Secretary, delivered a political report, and Imre Vajda, Chairman of the National Planning Bureau, reported on the draft of the Five-Year Plan.
    The plenary session approved Rakosi's report and adopted several suggestions he put forward.
    After listening to Imre Vajda's report, the plenary session adopted the draft Five-Year Economic Plan for the development of the national economy. The entire party, mass organizations within the People's Front, and the people of the whole country will launch a wide-ranging discussion on this plan.
    The plenary session resolution stated that thanks to the implementation of the "Three-Year Plan," the Hungarian people will restore their national economy. The Three-Year Plan was completed in two years and five months, seven months ahead of schedule, thus making it necessary to formulate the next plan.
    Although the "Three-Year Plan" was a recovery plan, it also helped the development of the national economy. It made it possible to lay the socialist foundation not only in cities but also in the countryside.
    The "Five-Year Plan" will transform Hungary from a country with agriculture as the main industry and industry as a subsidiary to a country with industry as the main industry and agriculture as a subsidiary. The socialist part of the national economy will occupy a dominant position. To achieve this goal, nearly 35 billion forints (Hungarian currency) will be invested in the national economy, of which 17 billion will be invested in industry, 6 billion in agriculture, 6 billion in transportation, 3.5 billion for social and cultural needs, and 2.5 billion for housing construction.
    The realization of this investment plan will be guaranteed by the following: a steady increase in national income, with national income in 1954 to be 160 percent higher than in 1949; an increase of 40 percent in labor productivity in five years, and a reduction of 20 percent in production costs.
    The plenary session resolution particularly emphasized the necessity of eliminating the backwardness of the Hungarian countryside, increasing agricultural production, increasing livestock breeding, and promoting agricultural mechanization. This will make it possible to transform small-scale, decentralized household production into modern, advantageous large-scale production, thereby enabling the people to obtain a prosperous and civilized life.
    The resolution stated that by the end of the Five-Year Plan, there will be 500 tractor stations and 20,000 tractors.
    The resolution pointed out that as a result of the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, the living standards of the Hungarian working people will rise by 150 percent compared to the level of 1938.
    The Five-Year Plan is a great road for Hungary to become a strong, civilized, and socialist country.

　　匈牙利五年计划草案
    王禺译
    最近在布达佩斯举行的匈牙利工人党中央委员会的全会上，总书记拉科西同志作了政治报告，国家计划局主席伊墨·凡吉达报告了五年计划的草案。
    全会批准了拉科西的报告，并通过了他所提出的几项建议。
    在聆听伊墨·凡吉达的报告以后，全会通过了发展国民经济的五年经济计划草案。全党、人民阵线内各群众团体及全国人民将对该计划展开广泛讨论。
    全会决议说：由于“三年计划”的实行，匈牙利人民将恢复他们的国民经济。三年计划在两年零五个月内完成了，比预定时间提早了七个月，因此使制订下一步计划成为必要。
    虽然“三年计划”是一个恢复的计划，它也帮助了国民经济的发展。它使得不仅在城市里而且在乡村里打下社会主义的基础成为可能。
    “五年计划”将使匈牙利由一个农业为主、工业为辅的国家转变为一个工业为主、农业为辅的国家。国民经济中社会主义部份将占统治地位。为要达到这个目的，将近三百五十亿福林兹（匈币名）将被用来投资于国民经济，其中一百七十亿投资于工业，六十亿投资于农业，六十亿投资于运输，三十五亿供社会及文化之需，二十五亿作房屋建筑用。
    此一投资计划的实现，将由下列几项而得到保证：国民收入稳定地增加，在一九五四年中国民收入将要比一九四九年中多百分之一百六十；五年中劳动生产率增加百分之四十，而生产成本减低百分之二十。
    全会决议特别强调了去除匈牙利农村的落后性，提高农业生产，增加家畜饲养及推行农业机械化等等的必需。这样将使小型的、分散的家庭生产变成现代的、有利的大规模生产成为可能，从而使人民获得繁荣、文明的生活。
    决议说：在五年计划的末了，将要有五百个拖拉机站，二万架拖拉机。
    决议指出：五年计划实行的结果，匈牙利劳动人民的生活水准将较一九三八年的水平上升百分之一百五十。
    五年计划是匈牙利成为一个富强、文明的社会主义国家的大道。
