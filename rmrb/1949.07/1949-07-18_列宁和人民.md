	Lenin and the People
	By Alexander Bezymensky
	Translated by Hu Yang

	The greatness of a man who seeks happiness for the working people is boundless. In ancient myths or folk legends, such great feats have never been found. The people have infinite respect for those who accomplish such great feats.

	That man is Lenin. It is not the poet's verses, nor the sculptor's monuments, nor the musician's songs that have won him such glory. His glory is concretely embodied in the new life of the people, and the road to their new life was paved by his great labor. That is why Lenin's name has spread everywhere and is unforgettable to millions of people in every corner of the world.

	November 1917, in Peterhof.

	In the barracks of the Third Regiment, which actively participated in the attack on the fortress of Tsarist autocracy – the Winter Palace – a meeting was being held. Workers and peasants in gray military uniforms ran to the stage, cheering the establishment of the worker-peasant government and celebrating the victory of the Soviets.

	The audience gave warm, encouraging cheers to those who were not good at speaking. The speakers tried their best to express their confidence: good days had begun. They felt that they were now the masters of the country and the creators of national life. But they did not know how to put these feelings into words. They held their chests high with infinite joy. But what is the solid foundation of this joy? What makes them speak today with such bright confidence in the future?

	The situation on the streets is the answer to this question.

	A dozen people, including workers, sailors, and soldiers, carrying several large stacks of leaflets fresh from the printing press, poured into the hall. There were many leaflets, and everyone present received two copies of the greatest documents in history, printed on light red paper as thick as cardboard.

	These were the Decree on Peace and the Decree on Land, both signed at the bottom with Lenin's name.

	The hall was silent, more solemn than at any other time on earth. The soldiers' rough hands caressed the coarse pages, as if they hoped to convey their deep gratitude to the person who had turned their ideals into reality. The decrees clearly and explicitly stated:

	"The worker-peasant government, established as a result of the victory of the October Revolution (November 6th and 7th, Gregorian calendar), and supported by the Soviets of Workers, Soldiers, and Peasants, proposes to all warring nations and their governments to immediately begin negotiations for a just and democratic peace... "
	
	"The landlord ownership of land is abolished forthwith without any compensation... Private ownership of land is abolished forever... All land, whether state land, imperial land, monastery land, teaching land, factory land, ancestral heritage, private land, public land, or the land of our peasants... shall belong to the entire people and be used by the tillers."

	Suddenly, a powerful cheer resounded throughout the hall. Hundreds of hands holding red leaflets of the decrees were raised high, constantly waving them as their banner of struggle, the banner of life, and the banner of the future.

	The banner was embroidered with Lenin's great name.

	It is impossible to express in words, or even list one by one, what Lenin gave to the people of the entire Soviet Union and the world. Because even a thousand books would not fully explain it, let alone a short article? However, as long as we look at any fragment of life in the Soviet Union, Lenin's genius, foresight, and wisdom are reflected in it as clearly as in a mirror. This is precisely Lenin's greatness.

	When one flies in an airplane over the flat Dnieper prairie, the vast Ukrainian river basin unfolding under the wings is particularly moving. Like the blue pattern of an engineer, an arc cuts off the river, and on both sides of the arc are houses, factories, and buildings. A network of railways radiates from there in all directions. This is the glory of the Soviet people, something they can be proud of - the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station named after Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the best monument to commemorate Lenin, because it embodies the ideals of the great leader.

	Try reading Volume 22, page 434, second to last paragraph of Lenin's Selected Works: "Draft Plan of Scientific and Technical Work":

	"Particular attention should be paid to the electrification of industry and transportation, as well as the use of electricity in agriculture..."

	This article was written in April 1918, when the country was plunged into civil war, famine and economic difficulties, and the interventionist forces of Britain, Germany, France, and Japan were attacking the young Soviet Republic from all sides.

	In the harsh winter of 1920, Lenin proposed to the Soviet Congress a plan for the electrification of the Soviet Union. This plan was drafted by the country's leading engineers under Lenin's initiative and guidance.

	In the summer of 1921, Lenin reported on the preliminary achievements of the electrification plan:

	"Starting with 12,000 kilowatts of electricity is very ordinary, and perhaps those familiar with the electrification situation in the United States, Germany, or Sweden will laugh at us, but he who laughs last laughs best."

	Since then, dozens of power stations have been built in the Soviet Union. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's power generation had risen from fifteenth in the world (1913) to third in the world, and second in Europe. At that time, the largest power station was the Lenin Hydroelectric Station on the Dnieper River. It is a symbol of socialist industrialization.

	The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, like other things established by Lenin's genius or his initiative, is a concrete manifestation of the power of the truth he discovered.

	Countless vicious enemies of human progress have tried to block the road to truth, attempting to crush and eliminate truth, or force them to betray it! But all these attempts are in vain.

	The Hitlerite bandits occupied the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, and they tried to force the engineers to continue working in the occupied power station. However, not one of them served the fascists. The Bolshevik underground organizations and guerrilla organizations turned the areas under fascist rule into a raging volcano.

	Before being defeated and fleeing by the Soviet army, the Nazi troops destroyed the power station. They destroyed ten sections of the dam, sluice gates, and many other pieces of equipment. However, this barbaric action could not destroy Lenin's immortal cause.

	During the war, on an evening in March 1944, after the Hitlerite bandits were first driven out of Zaporozhye, a DC generator of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station began to rotate for the first time. Its total power was 3,000 kilowatts, and when the lights first came on, the Soviet people - a passionate, wise, and strong-willed nation - regarded it as a sign of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station's regeneration, and the beginning of further development of the Soviet Union's power.

	The reconstruction of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station is an amazing undertaking. The Soviet people must not only struggle with the mighty river, not only clean up tens of millions of cubic meters of crushed concrete, but also fight against the conspiracies of the American Electric Company. This company supplied three sets of unusable thrust bearings, and also delayed the delivery date of the first turbine generator's electrical equipment.

	At minus twenty-two degrees Celsius, engineers and workers built a substation on a high ground of twenty meters. They gathered old parts and installed the first steam generator; after installing the thrust bearings, four turbines began to rotate.

	They worked hard to restore the power station named after Lenin. They were victorious, and Lenin's banner fluttered above their heads.

	We can tell those who ridiculed the electrification of the Soviet Union in 1918, and those who still laugh falsely today, that the fact is this: the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station is being restored at maximum speed. Two major problems are being solved - increasing power and expanding the power station on the newest technological basis in the Soviet Union. Before the war, it took twelve years from the beginning of the construction to the completion of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station. Now, this work only requires half the time.

	This will decide who will win the last laugh. But Lenin has already answered this question.

	October 1920 in Moscow.

	On the rostrum of the Third Congress of the Communist Youth League, Lenin delivered a historically significant speech:

	"Therefore, this generation, which is now fifteen years old, will live in a communist society in ten or twenty years..."

	These words left a deep impression on the young members of the Communist Youth League present.

	During the break, a child wearing wide, patched shorts walked up to Lenin and excitedly stammered, "Vladimir Ilyich, really? Do you mean that I - I... will live in a communist society!"

	Lenin's eyes lit up. He was deeply moved.

	"Yes!" He answered loudly. "Yes! You! You, my dear comrade!"

	The child clapped his hands with joy. He turned and ran back to the hall. Lenin stared at him from behind, his face serious and tense. He seemed to see this child, sixteen years older, attending the Eighth Provisional Congress of Soviets, listening to the speech of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the successor to Lenin's great cause:

	"In short, we have basically completed the first step of communism - socialism."

	× × ×

	For thirty-one years, the Soviet people have been advancing along the communist road indicated by Lenin. Millions of workers in countries around the world struggling against capitalism are gathering around Lenin's banner. The dawn of a bright future is increasingly clearly illuminating the modern world - all roads lead to a communist world. Under Stalin's leadership, the time is approaching when our country will realize communism. The day when the decaying body of capitalism collapses is not far away.

	What Lenin said will certainly be.

    列宁和人民
    亚历山大·毕滋门斯基著
    胡扬节译
    一个为劳动人民谋幸福的人底伟大是无限的。在古代神话或民间传说中，还没有发现过这样伟大的功绩。完成这样伟绩的人，人民对他有无限的尊敬。
    这个人便是列宁。不是诗人的诗篇，不是雕刻家的纪念碑，也不是音乐家的歌唱，使他获得如此光荣，他的光荣是具体体现在人民的新生活中，他们的新生活的道路是他用伟大的劳动所铺平的，那就是为什么列宁的名字传遍每一个地方，为全世界每个角落千百万人民念念不忘的原因。

    一九一七年十一月、在彼得霍夫。
    在曾经积极参加攻击帝俄专制城堡——冬宫的第三团营房中正举行着一个会，穿灰色军装的工人农民们，跑到台上，欢呼工农政府的成立，庆祝苏维埃的胜利。
    听众给予不善于讲话的人以亲切的鼓励的欢呼。讲话者尽力表示出他们的信心：好日子已经开始了。他们感到现在自己才是国家的主人，才是国家生活的创造者。但是他们不知道怎样使这些感觉用话说出来。他们因无限的愉快而高挺着胸膛。但什么是这些愉快的巩固基础？什么东西使得他们今天带着这样对前途的光明的信心去讲话呢？
    街上的情形是对这个问题的回答。
    十几个人，有工人、水手和士兵，带着几大叠刚从印刷所拿出来的传单，涌进大厅去。传单很多，在座的每个人都得到两份历史上最伟大的，用浅红色纸印的，象厚纸板一般粗糙的文件。
    那是和平法令和土地法令，两本书的下边都签有列宁的名字。
    大厅上很寂静，比地球上任何时候都庄严肃穆。士兵们粗庄的手抚摩着粗糙的篇子，好象他们希望把深沉的感谢传达给曾使他们的理想变成现实的人。法令上清楚而明确地写道：
    由于十月革命（公历十一月六、七日）的胜利而成立的，为工人、士兵和农民的苏维埃所支持的工农政府，向所有交战国家及其政府提出：立即开始正义的民主的和平谈判。……
    “立刻毫无报偿地废除地主土地所有权。……永久废除土地私有权。……一切土地，无论国家土地、皇室领地、寺院土地、教学土地、工厂土地、祖先遗产、私地、公地、我农民的土地……均属于全体人民所有，归耕者使用。”
    忽然，一片有力的欢呼声响彻大厅。几百只手拿着红色的法令传单高高地举起，不断的摇动，作为他们斗争的旗帜，生命的旗帜和将来的旗帜。
    旗帜上绣着列宁的伟大的名字。
      ×            ×    ×
    列宁给予全苏联和全世界人民的，不可能用言语表达，甚至也不能逐一列举。因为即或一千册书也不会充分说明，何况一篇短短的文章？但是，我们只要拿苏联生活中的任何一片断来看，列宁的天才、预见和智慧反映在其中好象在镜子里一样清晰。这就正是列宁的伟大。
    当一个人驾着飞机飞翔在平坦的聂泊尔草原的上空，展开在机翼下的广阔的乌克兰流域的景致是特别动人的。宛如工程师的蓝色图案一样，一道弧形切断了这条河，弧形的两侧，住宅、工厂、建筑物毗毗皆是。铁路网从那里向四方辐射。这是苏联人民的光荣，是他们足以引为自豪的——用乌拉德米尔·依里奇·列宁名字的聂泊河水电站，它是纪念列宁的一个最好纪念物，因为它体现了伟大领袖的理想。
    试阅读列宁选集第二十二册、四三四页，倒数第二段：“科学与技术工作计划大纲”：
    “应该特别注意工业和运输业的电气化以及农业上电力的使用……”
    这篇文章写在一九一八年四月，正当全国陷入内战，饥馑和经济困难中，英、德、法、日的干涉军从各方面向年青的苏维埃共和国进攻的时候。
    一九二○年严冬，列宁向苏维埃会议提出苏联电气化的计划。这个计划是由国内第一流工程师在列宁的发动和指导下草拟成的。
    一九二一年夏天，列宁报告电气化计划初步成绩时说：
    “开始时有一万二千千瓦电力是很平常的，也许熟习美国德国或瑞典电气化情况的人们会笑我们，但是，谁笑在最后，谁才笑得最好。”
    从那时起，几十座的电力站在苏联建立起来了。在第二个五年计划末期，苏联发电量已从世界第十五位（一九一三年）上升到世界第三位，在欧洲则为第二位。当时，最大的一个电力站是聂泊河岸上的列宁水电站。它是社会主义工业化的象征。
    聂泊尔水电站象其他由列宁的天才或他的发动而建立起来的东西一样，是他发现的真理的力量的具体表现。
    无数人类进步的恶毒的敌人，曾竭力阻止到达真理的道路，企图粉碎和消灭真理，或者迫使他们叛变！但是，所有这一切企图，都是枉然的。
    希特勒匪徒占领了聂泊河水电站，他们企图强迫工程师继续在被占领的电站工作。然而，他们当中没有一个人为法西斯服务。布尔塞维克的地下组织和游击队组织，把法西斯统治下的区域，变为一座猛烈的火山。
    被苏军击败逃跑前，纳粹军队破坏了电力站。毁坏了十段堤坝、水闸门及其他许多设备。但是，这种野蛮的行动，不能破坏列宁的不朽事业。
    在战争时期，一九四四年三月的一个晚上。希特勒匪徒第一次从热波若叶被驱逐之后，聂泊尔水电站的一架直流发电机，首先开始转动起来。它的总量是三千千瓦，电灯第一次亮了，苏联人民——热情、明智、意志坚强的民族——认为是聂泊尔水电站再生的预兆，是苏联是力更进一步发展的开始。
    聂泊尔水电站的重建是一桩惊人的事业。苏联人民不仅必须与巨大的河流斗争；不仅必须收拾几千万立方米尺的毁碎了的混凝土；而且必需与美国电力公司的阴谋斗争。该公司供给了三套不能用的推力承轴，同时还拖延第一涡轮发电机电力装备的交货日期。
    在摄氏零下二十二度，工程师和工人们在二十公尺高的高地建立起分电站来。他们把旧有的零件凑集起来装置第一座蒸汽发电机；安好推力承轴，四个涡轮就开始转动了。
    他们为了恢复用列宁名字命名的电力站而辛勤地工作着。他们胜利了，列宁的旗帜飘荡在他们的头上。
    我们可以告诉在一九一八年讥笑苏联电气化，以及在今天还发出假笑的人们，事实是这样的：聂泊尔水电站正以最大速度在恢复着。正在解决两个大问题——增加电力和在苏联最新的技术基础上扩大电站。战前，聂泊尔水电站从开始建立到完成，费了十二年时间。现在，这项工作只需要一半的时间。
    这将决定谁会赢得最后的笑。但列宁已回答了这个问题。

    一九二○年十月在莫斯科。
    在共产主义青年团第三次代表大会的讲台上，列宁发表了具有历史意义的讲话：
    “因此，现在年纪在十五岁的这一代，在十年或二十年内，将生活在共产主义社会里……”
    这些话，给在座的青共团员们留下了极深刻的印象。
    休息时间，一个穿着宽大的补绽短裤的孩子走到列宁跟前，兴奋得结结巴巴地问他道：“乌拉基米尔·依里奇、真的吗？你的意思是说我——我……将生活在共产主义社会里！”
    列宁的眼睛发亮了。他深深地激动着。
    “是的！”他大声的回答说。“是的！你！你，我亲爱的同志！”
    小孩高兴得鼓起掌来了。转身跑回大厅去。列宁从后面盯视着他，面部严肃而紧张。他似乎看见这小孩，长了十六岁，参加第八次苏维埃临时代表大会，倾听着伟大的列宁事业的继承者——约瑟夫·维塞里昂维奇·斯大林──的讲话：
    “总之，我们已经基本上完成了共产主义的第一步——社会主义。”
        ×         ×          ×
    三十一年以来，苏联人民在沿着列宁指示的共产主义道路迈进。为反对资本主义而斗争的世界各国千万工人正集合在列宁旗帜的周围。光明前途的曙光愈益明显的照耀着现代世界——条条道路通向共产主义世界。在斯大林领导之下，我国实行共产主义的时候临近了。资本主义腐朽的躯壳崩溃之日也不远了。
    列宁说什么。将来就一定是什么。
