Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th—The remnant bandit gang of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou, after the complete collapse of the pseudo-gold yuan coupons, announced the issuance of so-called "Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates" on the 2nd of this month, attempting to carry out another cruel plunder before they enter their graves, destroying the economic life of the Chinese people. The pseudo-silver dollar coupons are divided into five types: one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan, and have been issued since the 4th of this month. At the same time, the bandit gang kicked away the pseudo-gold yuan coupons, refusing to redeem them, and finally declared that the currency they issued was completely waste paper, causing unprecedented losses to the people. As with the issuance of the pseudo-gold yuan coupons, this time the bandit gang is once again deceiving themselves by flaunting so-called "full reserves and full redemption." The difference is that silver dollars are allowed to circulate at the same time. The reason, according to pseudo-Finance Minister Xu Kan in a speech on the 4th, is that soft currency can no longer be trusted by the people. But in fact, the Kuomintang bandit gang has a deeper conspiracy in taking this measure, which is to take the opportunity to obtain silver dollar coins from the people, and through the false connection with silver dollars, obtain the help of silver dollars to carry out currency speculation, disrupt the market, destroy finance, and harm the people's economic construction. They know that the world today no longer belongs to the four major families, so everything they do is focused on corrupting the motherland. After deciding to issue the pseudo-silver dollar coupons, the pseudo-Executive Yuan's Wartime Funding Preparation Committee passed a resolution: "Promote a temporary property tax, issue patriotic silver dollar bonds of 300 million yuan, and organize 'patriotic' donations of 100 million silver dollars." This fully proves that the bandit gang's so-called "redemption" is to use their worthless pseudo-currency to redeem the people's silver dollars and property. As for the people wanting to redeem from them? Then, according to regulations, it can only be done in "certain designated cities," and according to Xu Kan, "there will inevitably be some technical and environmental difficulties in handling redemption in various places." That is to say, it is impossible to do. In the face of the bandit gang's collapsing rule and financial collapse, the pseudo-silver dollar coupons, like the pseudo-gold yuan coupons, will completely collapse before long. According to a Guangzhou dispatch from the bandit Central News Agency on June 29th, the bandit gang's "monthly national treasury expenditure reaches 100 million silver dollars," and "customs revenue is now negligible, while revenue from commodity taxes... is also limited." Therefore, "the deficit problem that has been impossible to solve for many years will be even more difficult to solve at this time of 'military urgency,' which goes without saying." Naturally, the only way to make up for it is to rely on advances from the pseudo-Central Bank, that is, to issue a large number of pseudo-silver dollar paper bills and plunder the people's blood and sweat without compensation. The bandit gang's so-called "restoration of the silver standard" has proven to be a new and larger-scale looting of the people.

　　广州残匪临死前再一次残酷掠夺
  　发行“银元券”洗劫人民
    命运将和伪金元券一样
    不用多久就会完全垮台
    【新华社北平十四日电】广州国民党残余匪帮在伪金圆券完全崩溃之后，于本月二日宣布发行所谓“银元兑换券”，图谋在他们进入坟墓以前，进行再一次残酷的掠夺，破坏中国人民的经济生活。伪银元券计分一元、五元、十元、五十元、一百元五种，已于本月四日起发行。同时，匪帮已将伪金元券，一脚踢开，不予收兑，自己最后宣判自己发行的货币完全成为废纸，使人民遭受空前浩大的损失。与发行伪金元券时同样，这次匪帮又自欺欺人地标榜所谓：“十足准备，充分兑现”，所不同的是允许银元同时流通。其原因，据伪财长徐堪四日在谈话中说，是由于软币已经不能取信人民。但实际上国民党匪帮采取这一措施还有一个更深刻的阴谋，就是借此套取人民手中的银元硬币，并经过与银元的假相的联系，取得银元的帮助，来进行货币投机，捣乱市场，破坏金融，危害人民的经济建设事业。他们知道，今天的天下已非四大家族所有，所以一切作为无不着眼于糜烂祖国。在决定发行伪银元券以后，伪行政院战时经费筹备委员会即通过决议：“推行临时财产税，发行爱国银元公债三亿元，并举办‘爱国’捐，捐献银元一亿元”。这就充分地证明，匪帮的所谓“兑现”，是以他们的一文不值的伪币来兑取人民的银元和财产。至于人民要向他们兑现呢？那么，按规定只能在“若干指定的都市”，而且据徐堪宣称：“各地办理兑现在技术上及环境上必然遭致若干困难”。就是说，是不可能办到的事。在匪帮统治崩溃和财政崩溃的情况之下，伪银元券和伪金元券同样，不要很久就会完全垮台。据匪中央社六月二十九日广州电称，匪帮“每月国库支出达一亿银元”，“关税收入现已微不足道，而货物税等收入，……为数殆亦有限”，因此，“历年来无法解决的赤字问题，值兹‘军事倥偬’之际，其更难解决，自无庸讳言”。自然，唯一的弥补方法就是依靠伪中央银行的垫款，即大量发行伪银元券纸币，无代价地掠夺人民的血汗。匪帮所谓“恢复银本位”，事实证明只是对于人民新的更大规模的洗劫。
