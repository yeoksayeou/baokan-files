Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th—According to news from Northern Jiangsu: After the Party and government leading organs at all levels in Northern Jiangsu vigorously mobilized and organized the people to repair dikes and drain water, 200,000 mu of autumn crops have been saved. In Taixing County, the three districts along the river mobilized more than 50,000 laborers, and within two weeks, they completed more than 21,000 zhang of river dikes (generally heightened by one to three chi and widened by six chi to one zhang and two chi), 240 large and small breaches, and more than 40,000 zhang of port dikes along the river. The Secretary of the Taixing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County Head personally led the heads of various departments and bureaus, braving the rain to go to the dangerous locations along the Hai'an and Taizhou lines to lead and organize the people to drain water, build dams, and repair sluice gates. After more than 3,500 cadres and masses braved the rain to rush repairs on 17 dam sluice gates along the line for three days and nights, all were completed, saving 150,000 mu of autumn crops. The Secretary of the Liandong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (eastern Lianshui, newly established county) in Yancheng Prefecture led the people to rush and repair the dangerous works of the Er Tang of the Huai River, freeing the two counties of Liandong and Binhai (southern Guanyun, newly established county) from the danger of being flooded. Low-lying cotton fields in Sheyang County (western Yancheng, newly established county) were flooded from the 3rd of this month, reaching more than 22,700 mu. After the Party and government cadres in the district led the people to cut firewood and drain water, by the 7th, more than 5,600 mu of cotton fields had been completely drained.
