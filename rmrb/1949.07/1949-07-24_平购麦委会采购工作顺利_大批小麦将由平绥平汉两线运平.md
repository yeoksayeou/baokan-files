　　Smooth Progress of Wheat Purchasing Work by the Ping Purchase Wheat Committee
  　Large Quantities of Wheat to be Transported to Ping via the Ping-Sui and Ping-Han Lines
    [Our Newspaper] The wheat purchasing work outside of Ping City, undertaken by the joint public-private Ping Purchase Wheat Committee, is progressing smoothly. The team dispatched to the Ping-Sui Line has already purchased approximately 200,000 jin of wheat in Xinghe County, which can be transported via Chaigoubu. The trade authorities of Chahar Province have agreed that the Ping Purchase Wheat Team can purchase 1,000,000 jin of wheat in Xinghe, and purchases can be made at any time upon arrival of funds. The Wheat Purchase Committee dispatched a special envoy with 10,000,000 yuan last night (the 23rd) to the wheat purchase team to continue purchasing, and is continuing to raise funds to purchase and transport wheat successively. The cost of the wheat purchased this time, based on reasonable local market prices, will not exceed 70 yuan per jin upon arrival in Beiping, which is much cheaper than the price in Ping City. This not only satisfies the city's need for wheat but also increases the purchasing power of farmers in wheat-producing areas, enabling them to purchase the industrial products they need, thus promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Xinghe is currently using the money from selling wheat to purchase cloth. According to a report from the Ping-Sui Line wheat purchase team, the wheat in Xiadong Banner and Pingdiquan in Suidong is of good quality and low price, approximately 41 or 42 yuan per jin. The Wheat Purchase Committee decided at a meeting yesterday to cable the team to go to nearby areas to negotiate large-scale purchases.
    In addition, the Ping-Han Line wheat purchase team has purchased 130 shi of wheat in Baoding and is continuing to purchase more. Another team has been dispatched to Ding County and Shijiazhuang to investigate local wheat production, quantity, and price. (Zhong)

　　平购麦委会采购工作顺利
  　大批小麦将由平绥平汉两线运平
    【本报讯】平市公私合组之购麦委员会，外出采购小麦工作进行顺利。派赴平绥线之小组已在兴和县购妥小麦约二十万斤，即可经柴沟堡运来，察省贸易机关允平购麦小组可在兴和采购小麦一百万斤，款到即可随时购买。购麦委会昨（二十三日）晚又派专人携款一千万元前往交购麦小组续购，并仍继续筹款以便陆续购运。此次购妥之小麦系按当地合理之市价，运到北平后之成本最高超不过七十元一斤，较平市价便宜甚多。不仅满足了城市对小麦的需要，且增加了麦产区农民的购买力，用以购买其所需要之工业品，促进了城乡物资交流。兴和当地刻正以售卖小麦的款项购买布匹。另据平绥线购麦小组报告，绥东旗下营、平地泉小麦质好价廉，每斤约四十一、二元，购麦委会昨开会决定电该小组就近前往大批洽购。
    又平汉线购麦小组已在保定购到小麦一百三十石，仍继续采购中，并又派人赴定县、石家庄调查当地产麦情形、数量及价格。（仲）
