    A Small Number of Unscrupulous Merchants in Beiping
    Sell Fake Goods to Deceive the Masses
    The Municipal Government is Studying Solutions

    [This newspaper's dispatch] A small number of illegal and unscrupulous merchants in Beiping are forging trademarks and selling counterfeit goods, seriously damaging the interests of the masses and affecting the development of legitimate trade. In Beiping, there have always been a few merchants who do not engage in honest business, but specialize in speculation and profiteering. They have not repented even after the liberation of Beiping and continue to engage in illegal activities. Counterfeit goods and fake trademarks are often encountered in the market. According to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, taking the yarn and cloth market in Buyangzi as an example, since May, many illegal commercial activities have been discovered. In addition to speculation, hoarding, and driving up prices, forging trademarks and selling counterfeit goods is also one of the important activities of unscrupulous merchants. For example, Dachang Cloth Shop and Tongshun Yuan Cloth Shop specialize in forging trademarks and selling inferior goods after repackaging them. After being discovered and investigated, Dachang Cloth Shop handed over a metal mold (trademark base plate); Tongshun Yuan Cloth Shop also admitted to having two fake brands. Wang Xinran, No. 84, Dongliushu Well, and Tongxinghe Embroidery Bureau in the North Courtyard of Shihutong, have been reprinting fake foreign cloth for people since 1937. Wang prints 20 pieces a day, charging 30 yuan per piece (price in early May); Guo Jingyao, No. 60, Huashi Street, specializes in carving fake molds, and Wang Xinran's fake trademark came from his hand; individual brokers have become assistants to these speculative merchants, and some even sell fake goods themselves. For example, cloth market broker Yan Jingchao once sold three pieces of sunshine cloth (60 pieces in total) to Juyuan Heng, and later discovered that they were all fake brands. In the cloth market, there are generally two ways to repackage and sell counterfeit goods: one is to cut off the original brand of inferior goods and reprint a fake brand to充好货（sell them as good goods); the other is to cut off a portion of the original brand cloth (generally about 20 chi - a traditional Chinese unit of length) (which is not inferior) and reprint the brand,冒充足匹出售(selling cloth that is not enough lengths as cloth that is full lengths). The target of their deception is generally farmers from the countryside who come to the city to buy goods. This illegal act not only violates the government's regulations on protecting the exclusive use of industrial and commercial trademarks, and directly harms producers, but also causes serious harm to consumers, affecting the development of legitimate trade and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce is now studying effective solutions in accordance with the reflections and requirements of the masses and legitimate merchants.

    平市少数奸商
    售假货骗群众
    市府正研究解决办法
    【本报讯】平市少数不法奸商，伪造商标，冒牌售货，严重损害群众利益，影响正当贸易的发展。平市向有少数商人不务正业，专事投机渔利，北平解放至今仍不知悔改，继续进行不法活动，市场上经常会碰到一些冒牌货与假商标。据工商局调查，以布巷子纱布市场为例，从五月到现在，已发现非法的商业活动多起，除投机倒把买空卖空哄抬物价外，伪造商标，冒牌售货亦为奸商重要活动之一。如达昌布庄、同顺远布庄，专门伪造商标，将次货改装出售，前经发现追究，达昌布庄交出铁制模子一个（商标底版）；同顺远布庄也承认有两个假牌子。东柳树井八十四号王新然，石虎胡同北大院同兴和绣花局，都是从三十七年起就给人改印假洋布。王某每天印二十匹，每匹收费三十元（五月初价）；花市大街六十号的郭景尧则专刻假模子，王新然的假商标，就出于他手；个别的经纪人成为这类投机商人的助手，有的自己就售卖假货。如布市经纪人阎静潮曾经手售给聚源恒阳光布三件（共六十匹），后发觉全系假牌。在布市市场上，冒牌改装的方法大致有二：一是将次货原牌裁掉，改印假牌，充好货。一是将原牌布（不是次货）裁去一部（一般在二十尺左右），另印牌子，将不足匹之布冒充足匹出售。其欺骗对象，一般为四乡来市买货的农民。此种非法行为，不但破坏了人民政府保护工商业商标专用的法令，直接损害了生产者，同样给消费者以严重的损害，影响正当贸易的发展和城乡物资交流。现人民政府工商局正按照群众和正当商人的反映和要求，研究有效的解决办法。
