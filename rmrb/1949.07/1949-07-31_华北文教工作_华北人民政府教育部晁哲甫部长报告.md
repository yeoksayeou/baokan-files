　　North China Cultural and Educational Work
　　Report by Chao Zhefu, Minister of Education of the North China People's Government

　　[Ping City News] At the enlarged meeting of the Third Committee of the North China People's Government, Minister of Education Chao Zhefu reported on cultural and educational work:

　　Minister Chao, based on the North China Region's Cultural and Educational Construction Plan for 1949, explained the implementation of cultural and educational work in the past few months from three aspects. Regarding education, he first pointed out that to build North China to support the Liberation War and meet the needs of the nationwide victory, it was necessary to train and improve a large number of cadres. The task of training 50,000 to 60,000 cadres within a year was accomplished and even exceeded through the reorganization and expansion of various schools and training classes, especially after the liberation of Ping and Tianjin, when a large number of young students and intellectuals were admitted. Currently, the total number of students in China University, Revolutionary University, other specialized colleges, and administrative region cadre training classes has not only completed this task but also exceeded it. He then explained the restoration, reorganization, and development of primary and secondary education, which is the urgent demand of the broad masses of working people to improve their cultural lives after the land reform. Therefore, after the Secondary Education Conference was convened last September and the Implementation Measures for Secondary Education were formulated, the Regional Primary Education Conference was convened in May of this year to resolve major issues such as the guiding principles, academic system, curriculum, and teachers of primary education. The convening of these two conferences has played a significant role in the reorganization and development of primary and secondary education. The former not only has a decisive significance for the regularization of secondary education but also promoted the correction of deviations and reorganization of primary education. The latter not only took a step forward in the regularization of primary education but also laid a certain foundation for preparing for the popularization of education to meet the cultural requirements of the broad masses of working people. Regarding social education, there has been not only great development in the old liberated areas but also many new creations. For example, Yangko dances and rural theater troupes existed in almost every village in the previous period; blackboard newspapers, rooftop broadcasts, and literacy groups were also seen everywhere. These are worthy of being promoted and popularized. The large-scale development of short-term training and after-school supplementary education in the newly liberated areas is also a point that should be emphasized.

　　Regarding literary and artistic work, Minister Chao pointed out that North China's literary and artistic work has seen new developments and achievements in the past year. In continuing to implement the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and developing mass literary and artistic work, the Taihang District alone has about 2,000 village theater troupes, averaging 50 troupes per county. After entering Ping and Tianjin, the policy of serving workers was implemented, and a large number of cadres went to factories to help workers carry out literary and artistic activities. For example, in Tianjin alone, at least 40 factories already have literary and artistic organizations. To encourage literary and artistic creation, Taihang and Jizhong launched mass creation movements. Taihang received 500,000 words of works, and Jizhong received more than 100 solicited works, most of which were works by district and village cadres. In addition, achievements have also been made in reviewing and adapting old scripts, uniting and transforming old artists, and other work. While explaining the achievements of the above work, he also pointed out the main shortcomings in the work, such as insufficient attention to combining with production tasks, impatience in transforming old dramas, and insufficient attention to ideological and professional leadership. Regarding health work, Minister Chao listed the achievements in epidemic prevention, health administration, medical treatment, and the training of health cadres in the past six months, such as the total number of people vaccinated in North China this year exceeding 3.5 million. Beijing cleared 219,280 kilograms of garbage in 80 days, and 12 epidemic prevention units treated 1.35 million patients in half a year. At the same time, he emphasized a very important experience, that is, the experiment in Pingshan County under the Ministry of Health, which proved that local health work must be a mass movement to be carried out, and that traditional Chinese medicine and old-style midwives can and must be transformed and united.

  　华北人民政府教育部晁哲甫部长报告
    【平市讯】华北人民政府第三次委员会扩大会议上，教育部晃哲甫部长关于文教工作的报告：
    晁部长对文化教育工作，根据一九四九年华北区文化教育建设计划，将几个月实施情形分三方面作了如下说明。教育工作方面，他首先指出：为建设华北支援解放战争，迎接全国胜利的需要，大量培养与提高干部，预计在一年内培养五万至六万干部的任务，经过对各种学校、训练班的整顿扩充，特别在平津解放以后大量吸收青年学生及知识分子入学，现在总计华大、革大及其他专门学院、行政区干校训练班等学员的数目不但已经完成这个任务，而且已经超过。继而说明中小学教育的恢复整顿与发展，这是土地改革后广大劳动人民提高文化生活的迫切要求。因此，自去年九月召开了中等教育会议，制定了中等教育实施办法后。又于今年五月召开了全区小学教育会议，解决了小学教育的方针、学制、课程、师资等重大问题。由于这两次会议的召开，这对中小学教育的整顿与发展是起了很大作用。前者，不但对中学教育走向正规化有决定的意义，而且对小学教育的纠偏与整顿亦起了推动作用。后者，不但对小学教育正规化提高了一步，而且也给为满足广大劳动人民提高文化的要求，作普及教育的准备，奠定了一定的基础。关于社会教育，在老解放区不但有很大发展，而且有不少新的创造。如秧歌、农村剧团，前一时期几乎每村都有；黑板报、屋顶广播、识字组也到处可见。这颇值得发扬光大，普遍推广。新解放区短期训练，业余补习教育的大量开展等，也是很应该重视的一点。
    文艺工作方面，晁部长指出一年来的华北文艺工作是有新的开展与成绩的，在继续贯彻为工农兵服务方针，开展群众性文艺工作这点上，单太行区即约有村剧团二千个以上，平均每县有五十个剧团。进入平津后，贯彻为工人服务方针，大批干部到工厂帮助职工搞文艺活动，如天津一地，至少有四十个工厂已有文艺组织。对于鼓励文艺创作，太行、冀中都发动了群众性的创作运动，太行收到的作品达五十万字，冀中收到应征作品一百多篇，大部都是区村干部的作品。此外，对审查改编旧剧本，团结改造旧艺人等工作，亦均获有成绩。在说明上述工作的成绩同时，他还指出工作中的主要缺点，是对与生产任务结合注意不够；对改造旧剧有急性病，在思想上业务上的领导注意差。卫生工作方面，晁部长列举了半年来在防疫、卫生行政、医疗以及卫生干部的培养上成绩数字，如种痘人数本年华北各地总计在三百五十万以上，北平市八十天内即清除了垃圾二十一万九千二百八十公斤，防疫队十二个单位半年中即治疗病人一百三十五万等。同时他着重指出了一个很重要的经验，即卫生部平山县的实验，证明地方卫生工作必须是群众运动，才能开展，中医及旧式接产妇是可以并必须改造团结的。
