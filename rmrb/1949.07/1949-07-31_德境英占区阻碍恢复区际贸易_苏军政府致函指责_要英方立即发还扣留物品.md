　　British Zone of Germany Obstructs Restoration of Inter-Regional Trade
  　Soviet Military Government Sends Letter of Reproach
    Demanding Immediate Return of Detained Goods
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 30th: TASS, Berlin: On July 23rd, Lieutenant General Dratvin, Deputy Chief of the Soviet Military Government in Germany, sent a letter to Major General McCreery (previously translated as MacClaughry), Deputy Chief of the British Military Government in Germany, drawing the attention of the British military authorities to the abnormal situation in trade between the eastern and western occupation zones. Although the Soviet military authorities had completed all the obligations stipulated in the New York Agreement, the British authorities continued to create obstacles to the restoration of normal inter-regional trade. In addition, despite previous agreements, valuable goods belonging to the Soviet occupation zone, seized by the British military authorities after March 1, 1948, remain illegally detained in the British occupation zone. These goods include: 30,000 tons of manganese ore, various equipment, etc. This abnormal situation is inconsistent with the New York Agreement on lifting inter-regional trade restrictions imposed by Western countries after March 1, 1948, which proves that the Western occupying authorities have not yet fully implemented the New York Agreement. The Soviet Military Government hopes that the British side will issue all necessary instructions to eliminate the existing abnormal situation, and it is particularly important to immediately return all goods detained in the British zone of Germany to the eastern occupation zone.

　　德境英占区阻碍恢复区际贸易
  　苏军政府致函指责
    要英方立即发还扣留物品
    【新华社北平三十日电】塔斯社柏林讯：七月二十三日，德境苏联军政府副首长德拉特温中将致函德境英国军政府副首长麦克里恩（前译麦克劳）少将，提请英国军事当局注意东西占领区之间贸易方面的反常情况：虽然苏联军事当局完成了纽约协议所规定的一切义务，但是英国当局却继续制造妨碍恢复区际正常贸易的障碍。此外，尽管前已达到的协议，但在一九四八年三月一日以后为英国军事当局所扣下的属于苏占区的值钱物品，却仍被非法扣留在英占区。这些货品包括：三万吨的锰矿石、各种装备等等。这种反常情况，不符合关于取消西方国家在一九四八年三月一日以后所实施的区际贸易限制的纽约协议，这证明西方占领当局迄今没有完全实施纽约协议。苏联军政府希望英国方面将发出一切必需的训令，消灭现存的反常状况，特别重要的是应当立即还给东占区一切被扣在德境英占区中的货品。
