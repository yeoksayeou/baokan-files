　　Organize the Broad Masses of Workers to Adapt to the Victorious Situation
  　National Trade Union Work Conference Opens
    Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Vice Chairman Zhou Attend and Speak
    [Ping City News] The National Trade Union Work Conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions opened in Ping City on the 23rd. A total of 237 representatives from six regions including Northeast, North China, Central China, Shandong, and Northwest, as well as representatives from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions itself and other organizations attended. Including attendees and observers, there were approximately 700 people. Among the representatives, in addition to trade union workers, there were also representatives from local labor bureaus, factory administration, and Party committees. The opening ceremony was held at 3:00 PM that afternoon. Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Vice Chairman Zhou both attended to provide guidance.
    The conference began with an opening speech by Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. He emphasized the tasks and importance of this trade union work conference (the full text will be published separately).
    Subsequently, Xu Zhizhen, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, presented the following issues to the conference: (1) the conference agenda; (2) the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to serve as the presidium of the conference; (3) the establishment of four specialized issue committees: organization issues, labor insurance issues, labor-capital relations issues, and wage issues. He requested the conference to discuss the above three issues. All the representatives unanimously approved.
    Amidst warm applause, Commander-in-Chief Zhu took the stage to speak (the original text will be published separately).
    Finally, Vice Chairman Zhou delivered a political report to the conference. In his report, he discussed three issues: first, carrying the revolution through to the end; second, mobilizing the entire working class to restore production and build a new China; and third, uniting together (the full text will be published separately). The meeting lasted five hours and adjourned at 8:00 PM.
    [Ping City News] In order to discuss various issues of the National Trade Union Work Conference, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee at 9:00 AM on the 23rd. At the meeting, Comrade Li Lisan first reported that the year since the Sixth Labor Congress has been a year of new development in China's labor movement. The basic task of convening the National Trade Union Work Conference at present is to meet the needs of the current victorious revolutionary situation, and to basically organize the broad masses of workers across the country in about one year. In order to accomplish this major task, it is necessary to study the various important practical problems encountered in the current national trade union work, such as trade union organization issues, factory management democratization issues, labor-capital relations issues, wage issues, etc., and to conduct detailed discussions to arrive at correct conclusions and solve them one by one; that is to say, to summarize and exchange the experiences of various regions across the country, so that the national trade union work can achieve consistent methods and steps. The conference invited responsible comrades from local administrations and labor bureaus to participate, so that we can absorb opinions from all parties when discussing various issues, in order to obtain cooperation and assistance from all parties in trade union work in the future and develop rapidly. Comrade Li Lisan continued to point out that this conference is not a congress of representatives, but a work conference. Therefore, we do not talk about formalities, do not engage in extravagance, but earnestly discuss work, study issues, and solve problems. After the representatives from various regions return, they will convene trade union work conferences in their respective regions, combine with the specific local conditions, convey the decisions of this conference, and train and cultivate a large number of trade union work cadres. Only in this way can we carry out trade union work on a large scale throughout the country and promote the development of the national workers' movement more rapidly.
    The meeting then passed the following issues, preparing to submit them to the conference for discussion and approval: 1. Agenda of the National Trade Union Work Conference. 2. Propose that the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions serve as the presidium of the National Trade Union Work Conference, without re-election. 3. According to the issues discussed in the agenda of the National Trade Union Work Conference, establish the following four specialized issue research committees, and determine the persons in charge of each committee: 1. Organization Issue Committee, responsible by Li Lisan and Zhu Xuefan. 2. Labor Insurance Issue Committee, responsible by Yi Lirong and Xi Zhanyuan. 3. Labor-Capital Relations Issue Committee, responsible by Liu Zijiu and Shi Huaibi. 4. Wage Issue Committee, responsible by Li Lisan and Shen Ce. Other personnel participating in each committee will be nominated by the delegations from various regions, and each delegation must send at least one person to participate.
