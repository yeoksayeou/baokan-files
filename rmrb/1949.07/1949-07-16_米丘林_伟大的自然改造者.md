    Michurin
    —The Great Transformer of Nature
    Translated by Xue Sui
    "We cannot wait for nature to bestow benefits; we must wrest benefits from her. This is our task."
    —Michurin
    Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin, the great Russian scientist and selectionist, was born on October 27, 1855, in the village of Dolgoye, Ryazan Province, into the family of a small landowner.
    He entered a higher school in Ryazan, but due to his family's bankruptcy, he was unable to complete his studies. He went to work early in life, working as a clerk, assistant stationmaster, cashier, electrician, and even running a watch repair shop. Michurin's greatest interest was concentrated on horticulture. In 1875, he rented land and established an experimental nursery, systematically engaging in fruit tree selection work. In 1888, Michurin founded Russia's first selection nursery near the city of Kozlov (now Michurinsk) in central Russia, where he cultivated new varieties of apples, pears, and other fruit trees.
    Michurin's life was the experience of an indomitable and diligent worker. He worked in the most difficult circumstances for nearly forty years, without the help of the Russian Tsarist government, often enduring financial hardship, yet he stubbornly and persistently dedicated himself to the goal he had set.
    He said: "We cannot wait for nature to bestow benefits; we must wrest benefits from her. This is our task."
    After the establishment of the Soviet regime, Michurin's work gained broad room for activity. The state took responsibility for maintaining his nursery and allocated large amounts of funds for Michurin to carry out his scientific work. Under Lenin's personal instruction, Kalinin visited Michurin's orchard twice, the scope of which had by then greatly expanded.
    The Soviet government highly valued Michurin's work, awarding him the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. His book "Results of Fifty Years of Work" was also published in a magnificent edition. On the sixtieth anniversary of his work, he received congratulations from Stalin. He was given the title of "Meritorious Scientific Worker" and a doctorate in biology. He was an honorary member of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the Czechoslovak Academy of Agricultural Sciences, as well as a member of the American scientific organization "Breeders."
    This great Darwinian selectionist created nearly three hundred and fifty new varieties of fruits and berries of great value, which made it possible to transplant fruit trees to the far north and northeast of the Soviet Union.
    Michurin was a true scientist and experimentalist with progressive revolutionary ideas. He poured all his tireless energy into this great ideal: to enrich the land and cover it with dense orchards. He lived for the people, loved the people with the ardent soul of a Russian, and handed over the fruits of his labor and the wise intelligence of a scientist to the people.
    In 1934, Michurin wrote to Stalin, saying: "My lifelong dream has been realized: the many new varieties of fruit trees that I have cultivated are no longer transplanted from experimental nurseries to the orchards of individual rich peasants, but to the orchards of large-scale state farms and collective farms, to replace the original low-yielding and inferior varieties."
    With his extraordinary wisdom as an experimentalist, Michurin applied Darwin's theories to his scientific work. He crossbred various varieties, combining the excellent characteristics of each, and greatly improved the yield of all new varieties.
    Michurin's method of acting according to theory is the most valuable contribution to science and a new link in the development of agricultural biology. These methods have opened up unlimited possibilities for the development of new farmland plants.
    The Central Evolutionary Laboratory named after Michurin continues Michurin's work and has made great progress. A large number of hybrids have been planted in its many experimental areas. This batch of hybrids includes 150,000 varieties of "seed-bearing plants." Many variety testing and collection stations have been organized, cultivating more than two thousand varieties of fruit trees and shrubs selected from the Soviet Union and abroad.
    In the ten years from 1935 to 1945, the Central Evolutionary Laboratory cultivated and transported two million apple seedlings, one and a half million fruit tree grafts, and nearly one and a half million grapevine cuttings to various regions of the Soviet Union.
    Various Michurin plants have endured the severe winters of recent years, which proves the practical importance of Michurin's achievements.
    The Soviet Union is the richest country in the world in terms of plant resources. The existing types of plants are the basic material for creating new varieties, which will make the Soviet Union's farmland even richer.
    Thousands upon thousands of Michurin's followers are continuing the work of their teacher, creating improved local varieties of various fruit trees and shrubs. This work is being completed in many experimental stations, in many collective farm laboratories, and in many experimenters' own gardens. Remote Siberia and the Altai Mountains, and the Ukrainian and Central Asian Soviet Republics are now developing drought-resistant and frost-resistant varieties of melons and fruits.

### 米丘林——伟大的自然改造者

    米丘林
    ——伟大的自然改造者
    学燧译
    “我们不能等待自然恩赐福利，我们必须从她那里取得福利。这就是我们的任务。”        
      ——米丘林
    伊凡·乌拉地密诺维奇·米丘林，这个伟大的俄罗斯科学家和选种学家，一八五五年十月二十七日生在瑞山州道尔戈耶村的一个小地产所有者的家庭里。
    他进了瑞山的一个高等学校，但由于他的家庭破产，无法完成学业，他在早年就去工作了；他当过书记、助理站长、出纳员、电机师，还开过钟表修理店。米丘林最大的兴趣是贯注在园艺上。一八七五年，他租地搞了一个实验园圃，有系统地进行果树选种的工作。一八八八年，米丘林在俄罗斯中部考兹洛夫城（现名米丘林城）附近创立了俄罗斯第一个选种苗圃，他在那里培植出苹果、梨和其他果树的新变种。
    米丘林一生的经历是一个不屈不挠的辛勤工作者的经历。他在最困难的情况下工作了将近四十年，得不到俄国沙皇政府的帮助，经常忍受着金钱的困窘，他顽强而坚韧地致力于他所认定的目标。
    他说：“我们不能等待自然恩赐福利，我们必须从她那里取得福利。这就是我们的任务。”
    苏维埃政权建立以后，米丘林的工作得到了宽广的活动余地。国家负责维持他的苗圃，并且颁发大量基金让米丘林进行他的科学工作。在列宁的亲自指示下，加里宁曾两次访问过米丘林的果园，这个果园的范围那时已经扩展得很广大了。
    苏维埃政府对米丘林的工作估价很高，给他颁发了列宁勋章和劳动红旗勋章。他所写的“五十年工作的成果”一书，也印行了华丽的版本。在他的工作六十周年的时候，他接到了斯大林的祝贺。他得到“功勋科学工作者”的称号和生物学博士学位。他是苏联科学院和捷克农业科学院的名誉会员，同时也是美国的一个科学团体“繁殖者”的会员。
    这位伟大的达尔文学派的选种家创造出了将近三百五十种水果和浆果的很有价植的新变种，这些变种使果树可以移植到苏联遥远的北部和东北部。
    米丘林是一个真正的科学家和实验家，他有着进步的革命思想。他把他的不知疲竭的精力都全部投入这个伟大的理想：使土地富饶，使大地上布满着繁密的果园。他为人民生活着，他以俄国人的炽热的灵魂去爱人民，而且把他劳动的成果和一个科学家的聪睿的智慧交给了人民。
    米丘林在一九三四年写信给斯大林说：“我毕生的梦相已经实现了：我所培植出来的许多果树的新变种，已经不是从实验苗圃里移植到富农个人的果园里去，而是移植到大规模的国营农场和集体农场的果园里去，去代替原来的产量低的不好的品种。”
    米丘林凭他的实验家的非凡的智慧，把达尔文的学说应用到他的科学工作里去。他使各种不同的品种杂交，把各种品种的优良的特性结合到一起，使所有的新品种都有大为提高的产量。
    米丘林按照理论行事的方法，是对科学的最有价值的贡献，是农业生物学发展中的新环节。这些方法给发展新的农田植物开辟了无限可能性。
    以米丘林为名的中央进化学实验室，继续着米丘林的工作，已经有了很大的进展。已有一批数量巨大的杂种，种植在它的许多实验区里。这一批杂种包括着十五万种“籽生植物”的杂种。许多变种试验与收集站已经组织起来，培植着两千种以上的苏联和国外选出的果树与灌木。
    在一九三五到四五的十年当中，中央进化学实验室培植了并输送了两百万棵苹果树苗、一百五十万果树的接枝、和将近一百五十万葡萄藤的切枝，到苏联各个地区去。
    各种米丘林植物已经经受了最近这些年来的严寒的冬天，这证明了米丘林的成就之实际重要性。
    苏联在植物资源方面是全世界最富的国家。现有的各种类型的植物，就是创造新变种的基本素材，这些新变种将使苏联的农田更加丰富起来。
    千千万万米丘林的追随者，正继续着他们导师的工作，创造着各种果树与灌木改良的地方性变种。这一工作正在许多实验站、在许多集体农场实验室、在许多实验者们自己的园圃中完成着，偏远的西伯利亚和阿尔泰山区、在乌克兰和中亚细亚各苏维埃共和国，现在正发展着抗旱、抗霜的瓜果变种。
