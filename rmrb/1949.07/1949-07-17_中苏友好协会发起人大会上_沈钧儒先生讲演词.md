[Ping City News] The full text of Shen Junru's speech at the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is as follows: Gentlemen,

　　Today, I am attending this grand meeting, and I am so happy that I can't express it in words. Because the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, the two great powers, has been advocated by us for the past 30 years, and it is also what the entire Chinese people demand and hope for. Now, this demand and this hope can be fully realized.

　　As everyone knows, a hundred years ago, the great revolutionary teachers Marx and Engels published the famous "Communist Manifesto," which caused tremendous changes in the Western world. Marxism is the only compass that leads mankind towards a bright and happy future. It points out the highest realm of human life's upward development, and it also points out the inevitable path of revolutionary history.

　　At that time, the people of the East, including the Chinese people, were still in a dream, still muddling through their days under the dual oppression of feudalism and imperialism.

　　Who awakened the people of the East, who awakened the Chinese people?

　　We must thank the Russian people and their great leaders Lenin and Stalin. We must thank the Russian October Revolution.

　　The October Revolution was the first time that Marxism was applied to a major country in the world and achieved victory.

　　Stalin was right when he said: "The October Revolution was the first revolution in the world that broke the long slumber of the laboring masses of the oppressed nations of the East and drew them into the struggle against world imperialism."

　　There is no mistake, the October Revolution shattered the dreams of the people of the East, and the Chinese people began to truly awaken from this time on.

　　Lenin's call in 1919 that "the people of the East have awakened" caused a great response in China. Not only did it lead to the birth of the Chinese Communist Party, but also Sun Yat-sen, the great leader of the Chinese Kuomintang at the time, established the policy of alliance with Russia and the admission of Communists. In Sun Yat-sen's immortal will and in his letter to the Soviet people, he expressed his high faith in the Soviet Union.

　　In the past twenty years, although the Kuomintang traitor Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the country and the nation, practiced anti-communism internally, and anti-Sovietism externally, and there have been many twists and turns in the relations between China and the Soviet Union, the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union has never changed, and it has increased more and more. The Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese people, whether morally or materially, has also remained unchanged. Without the Soviet Union's assistance, China would have found it difficult to resist the Japanese aggressors in the early years of the Anti-Japanese War. Without the Soviet Union's moral support, the cause of the Chinese people's liberation would hardly have achieved today's achievements.

　　Now, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have basically defeated the domestic reactionaries and have established their own people's regime in most of the country. Therefore, the obstacles to the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union are about to be completely cleared, and no one can stop the handshake and cooperation between the people of these two countries.

　　But in the future, China needs long-term construction, needs to strengthen industrialization, and accelerate the development of production in order to catch up with advanced countries. All of this requires relying on the socialist Soviet Union to provide long-term friendly support. Chairman Mao Zedong of the CPC recently instructed us that it is wrong for the Chinese revolution to not rely on foreign aid. We must unite with nations in the world that treat me equally and fight together. There is no mistake, we must unite with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries and fight together, so that our country will have a bright future.

　　Therefore, in today's China, the most important thing is not anything else, but to promote the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The most precious thing is not anything else, but the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

　　In his dying letter to Soviet friends, Sun Yat-sen said: "I wish to express my fervent hope that the dawn will soon break, and at this time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands in the great war for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world to achieve victory." Now the dawn has broken, and Sun Yat-sen's prediction is about to be fulfilled. How gratifying and encouraging this is!

　　We, all the Chinese people, should learn from the great Soviet people and follow the Soviet Union in everything.

　　I wish the leader of the Soviet people, Stalin, good health!

　　I wish our Chinese people's leader, Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, good health!

　　Long live the friendship between the people of the two great republics of China and the Soviet Union!

### 中苏友好协会发起人大会上  沈钧儒先生讲演词

    中苏友好协会发起人大会上
    沈钧儒先生讲演词
    【平市讯】沈钧儒在中苏友好协会发起人大会上的讲演词，全文如下：各位先生：
    今天我来参加这个盛会，我高兴到说不出来。因为中苏两大国的友好合作，是三十年来我们所主张的，也是全中国人民所要求，所希望的。现在这个要求，这个希望可以完全实现了。
    大家都知道，在百年以前，伟大的革命导师马克思、恩格斯发表了著名的“共产党宣言”，使西方世界起了极大的变动。马克思主义，它是使人类走向光明幸福前途的唯一指南针，它指示了人类生活向上发展的最高境界，它也指点了革命历史的必然的道路。
    当其时，我们东方人民，包含我们中国人民在内，都还在睡梦中，都还在封建主义、帝国主义的双重压迫下糊里糊涂捱过日子。
    是谁唤醒东方人民，唤醒我们中国人民的呢？
    我们一定要感谢俄国人民和他们的伟大的领导者列宁、斯大林。我们一定要感谢俄国的十月革命。
    十月革命第一次把马恩学说应用到世界上一个大国而得到了胜利。
    斯大林说得对：“十月革命乃是世界上的第一次革命，它打破了东方被压迫民族劳动群众底长期的沉睡，把他们卷入在反对世界帝国主义的斗争中了。”
    一点没有错，十月革命打破了东方人民的迷梦，其中中国人民也就是从这时候才开始真正觉醒了。
    列宁于一九一九年提出“东方人民觉醒了”这一呼声，在我们中国起了极大的回响。不但是因此产生了中国共产党，而且当时中国国民党的伟大领导者孙中山先生也就确定了联俄容共政策。在孙中山先生的不朽的遗嘱，以及告苏联人民书中，都表示了他对苏联的高度的信仰。
    在这二十多年以来，虽然由于国民党叛徒蒋介石的出卖国家民族，对内实行反共，对外实行反苏，中苏两国邦交，发生了许多次波折，但是中苏两国人民的友好是从没有改变过，愈到后来愈增进。苏联对中国人民的帮助，不论是在道义上或在物质上，也是始终不变的。没有苏联的援助，在抗日战争最初几年中，中国就难以抵抗日本侵略者，没有苏联的道义声援，中国人民解放事业，也决难有今日的成就。
    现在中国人民在中国共产党的正确领导之下，已经基本打败了国内反动派，已经在大部分国土内建立了人民自己的政权。因此中苏两国友好关系的障碍物快要完全扫清，再没有人能够阻止中苏这两国人民的握手合作了。
    但是以后我们中国需要有长期的建设，需要加强工业化，加速发展生产，以迎头赶上先进国家。这都需要依靠社会主义的苏联，给予长期的友好的支援，中共毛泽东主席最近曾经指示我们说中国革命可以不依靠外援是错误的。我们要联合世界上以平等待我的民族共同奋斗。一点没有错，我们一定要联合苏联以及新民主国家，共同奋斗，我们的国家才有光明的前途。
    所以在今天的中国，最重要的事情不是别的，就是促进中苏两国的友好。最宝贵的东西不是别的，就是中苏人民间的兄弟般的友谊。
    孙中山先生在其临终写的致苏联友人书中说：“我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，此时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手共进，以取得胜利。”现在天已破晓，孙中山先生这一预言，就要应验了。这是多么值得欢欣鼓舞的事呢！
    我们，全中国人民应当向伟大的苏联人民学习，一切向苏联看齐。
    敬祝苏联人民领袖斯大林健康！
    敬祝我们中国人民领袖中共中央毛主席健康！
    中苏两大共和国人民友好万岁！
