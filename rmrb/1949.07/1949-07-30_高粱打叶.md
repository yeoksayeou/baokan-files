　　Sorghum is a crop that is relatively drought-resistant, flood-resistant, and tolerant to saline-alkali soils. Under the special natural conditions of North China, this crop is cultivated everywhere, whether on early mountain slopes, flood-prone low-lying areas, or even saline-alkali areas. Its cultivated area ranks third after wheat and millet, accounting for 15 percent of the total cultivated area. Therefore, sorghum is a very important crop in North China.

　　In places where sorghum is cultivated, the people have a common habit of stripping leaves from sorghum—in some places, after sorghum tassels, everyone can freely go to other people's fields to strip leaves. Stripping leaves from sorghum has its benefits, but stripping the leaves too early or stripping too many will reduce yields, so we should pay special attention to the timing of stripping and the number of leaves to leave.

　　Now that it is almost time to strip leaves from sorghum, the benefits of stripping leaves, the methods of stripping leaves, and precautions are introduced below for reference.

　　I. Benefits of Stripping Leaves from Sorghum:

　　1. In North China, sorghum is often intercropped or mixed with soybeans (or other crops). After stripping leaves from sorghum, soybeans can receive more sunlight, ventilation is improved, and they are less likely to get sick, allowing the crops to grow well.

　　2. The stripped sorghum leaves can be used to feed livestock or to weave cushions, baskets, etc.

　　3. After stripping leaves, the sorghum stalks are smooth, which facilitates harvesting and utilization.

　　4. Stripping leaves can also remove smut (head smut disease) to reduce the spread of disease.

　　II. Methods of Stripping Leaves:

　　1. Absolutely do not strip leaves before tasseling. If you strip leaves, the yield will be sharply reduced, the stalks will be thin and weak and easily lodged, and the grains will not be full.

　　2. Stripping leaves should not be done within seven days after tasseling. Stripping leaves immediately after tasseling can reduce the yield by about 30 percent; stripping leaves seven days after tasseling can reduce the yield by about 10 percent.

　　3. Stripping leaves can be done two weeks after tasseling (milk stage—the grains are green and contain milk), but at least four leaves must be left at the top.

　　4. If stripping leaves is done three weeks after tasseling (yellow ripe stage—the grains turn yellow and the milk has begun to congeal), it is enough to leave two leaves at the top.

　　III. Precautions:

　　1. When going to other people's fields to strip sorghum leaves, protect other people's crops. It is necessary to wait until the sorghum grains are full before stripping them, and do not strip them randomly.

　　2. When stripping leaves, it is best to also remove smut (head smut disease) and burn it at home to reduce the spread of disease.

　　3. Newly stripped young sorghum leaves contain a lot of hydrocyanic acid, which can easily poison livestock. Therefore, they should be fed to livestock after they have withered.

　　高粱打叶
    华北农业科学研究所  张锦熙
    高粱是一种比较耐旱、耐涝、抗盐碱性强的庄稼。在华北的特殊自然条件下，无论在较早的山坡地，易涝的低洼地，以至于盐碱地带，到处都栽培着这种庄稼。其栽培面积除小麦、粟以外居第三位，占总栽培面积的百分之十五，所以高粱是华北一种很重要的作物。
    在栽培高粱的地方，老百姓们都有一种普遍的习惯，就是高粱打叶——在某些地方，高粱抽穗以后，大家可以随便到别人家的田里去打叶。高粱的打叶有它的好处，但是打叶的时期早了或打的多了就会减少产量，所以我们应该特别注意打叶的时期和留叶数。
    现在快到高粱打叶的时候了，兹将高粱打叶的益处，打叶的方法，注意事项，分别介绍在下面，以供参考。
    一、高粱打叶的益处：
    １华北高粱多与大豆（或其他作物）混作或间作，高粱打叶以后，可使大豆多受日光，通风良好，不易生病，而使庄稼生长良好。
    ２打下来的高粱叶子，可以喂牲口或编制坐垫、篓子等用。
    ３打叶后高粱茎秆光洁，便于收获与利用。
    ４打叶同时可以打乌米（黑穗病），以减少病害传播。
    二、打叶的方法：
    １抽穗以前绝对不可打叶，如果打叶，则产量锐减，茎秆细弱易于倒伏，籽实不饱满。
    ２抽穗后七天以内不应该打叶。在刚抽穗时就打叶，可使产量减收三成左右；抽穗后七天摘叶，可使产量减收一成左右。
    ３抽穗后两星期（乳熟期—籽实青色内有乳浆）可以打叶，但顶部最少要留四个叶子。
    ４如在抽穗后三星期（黄熟期—籽实变黄乳浆已趋凝结）打叶，顶部留两个叶子就够了。
    三、注意事项：
    １到别人地里去打高粱叶子，要爱护别人的庄稼，必须等到高粱米饱满时再打，决不可随便乱打。
    ２打叶的时候，最好同时打乌米（黑穗病），拿回家中烧掉，以减少病害传播。
    ３新打的幼嫩高粱叶子，多含有氰氢酸，喂牲口容易中毒，故应俟其干萎后再喂牲畜。
