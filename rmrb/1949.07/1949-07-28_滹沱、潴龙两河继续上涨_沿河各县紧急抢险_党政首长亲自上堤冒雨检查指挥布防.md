[Jizhong Telegram] The water levels of the Hutuo and Zhulong rivers continue to rise, and the situation has now entered a critical stage. The water level at Huangbizhuang on the Hutuo River has reached 100.75 meters, an increase of 0.53 meters compared to the 23rd. The Yaozhuang section of Raoyang County has now exceeded last year's water level, with the water only 60-70 centimeters from the top of the dyke. The area between Yaozhuang in Raoyang County and Youzicun in Anping County is extremely dangerous. The villages of Zhongzhangying, Shizhuang, and Xinjiakou in Anping County are surrounded by water and in great danger; efforts are underway to rescue them. The Secretary of the Raoyang County Party Committee and the Head of the Organization Department and County Head of Anping County have personally gone to the dykes to direct operations. On the 23rd, the command headquarters at all levels of the Hutuo and Zhulong Rivers led emergency rescue teams into the flood control positions at night, inspecting and checking each section in the rain. The County Heads of Gaoyang, Boye, and Lixian counties also went to the dykes to direct operations on the 24th. All districts along the river in Gaoyang County have now abandoned other work and are focusing all their efforts on flood control. The water levels of the Tang, Fu, Wei, and Grand Canal rivers have also risen. The headquarters has notified all rivers to be vigilant and prepare for flood fighting.
    [Jizhong News] In the lower reaches of the Yongding River, the Jiangzhiying Southern Embankment in Yongqing County, due to insufficient preparation and lax inspection, suffered a 5-foot breach at Diyangwo on July 10th. The water flow was rapid, but due to the lack of soft materials and sacks, the rescue workers were helpless. By the morning of the next day, the breach had expanded to 200 meters. The County Headquarters immediately mobilized the people to rush to repair the 15-li embankment from the east of Cangshang Village through Yaomafang, Zhao Jiachang, Xiying, to Chengezhuang, in order to prevent the spread of the flood.
    In the upper reaches of the Yongding River, the Nan Di area of ​​Daxing saw a sharp rise in river water on July 8th, directly impacting the embankment at an angle, creating an emergency situation. After the militia guarding the embankment discovered the situation, they immediately reported to the command headquarters, which immediately issued an emergency notice. Due to thorough prior preparation, a rescue team of 548 people and 97 river soldiers, armed with stakes, cables, and other rescue tools, rushed to the dyke to actively protect it. In less than five hours, they planted 37 willow trees, and through intense protection efforts, the dangerous works were turned from danger to safety.
