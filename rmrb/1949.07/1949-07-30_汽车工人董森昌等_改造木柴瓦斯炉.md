[Hebei Central Electric] Dong Senchang and other workers from the automobile team of the Hebei Central Transportation Company have improved the wood-fired gasifier stoves on their vehicles, increasing load capacity and speed while reducing costs. The team's vehicles originally ran mostly on gasoline. Since switching to enterprise-based management in March of last year, worker Yu Huanbo used large gasoline drums to create wood-fired stoves, overcoming the difficulty of lacking gasoline. However, this stove was quite labor-intensive and costly to make (requiring 100 work-hours, five large oil drums, 70 jin of pig iron, and 200 screws), had a small load capacity, and consumed four and a half jin of firewood per li traveled. It was also prone to breaking down and difficult to repair. After the team moved to Baoding this year, they discovered a stove similar to those made in Beiping in a pile of captured enemy vehicles. Worker Dong Senchang then organized workers to study it and concluded that the stove had two shortcomings: first, the gap below the grate was too small, making it easy for ash to clog; second, the stove was too short, holding little firewood. After repairing these two areas, testing proved it to be much better than the original stove. Therefore, they imitated it to produce new stoves, but they were not easy to ignite. After further research by foreman Cai Yiren, they enlarged the air duct by one inch, making it ignite with a single crank. After a thousand-li round-trip transportation test, it proved that the stove's manufacture was successful. Since modifying this stove, transportation costs have been greatly reduced. They are now rushing to produce more, preparing to replace all the old stoves.

　　汽车工人董森昌等
  　改造木柴瓦斯炉
    【冀中电】冀中运输公司汽车大队工人董森昌等，改造了汽车上的木柴瓦斯炉，加强了载重和速率，减低了成本。该队汽车原多是烧汽油，自去年三月改为企业化经营后，工人于焕波即用大汽油桶造成木柴炉，克服了缺乏汽油的困难。但此炉做起来颇费工料（每个需一百工，五个大油桶，七十斤生铁和二百个螺丝），载重也小，行车一里需烧木柴四斤半；且常坏，又不好修理。今年该大队迁保定后，在缴获敌人的破汽车堆里发现了一个与北平造相类似的炉，工人董森昌随组织了工人研究，认为该炉有两个缺点：一是炉篦下面空隙太小，灰易塞满；二是炉短，盛木柴少。把这两处修理后，试用中证明比原炉好多了，遂依此仿制了新炉，但不易着火，经工长蔡义仁继续研究，将风道开大一寸，一摇便着了。现经往返千里运输试验，证明该炉的制造是成功的。自改装此炉后，运输成本已大大减低，现正赶制，准备旧炉全部换下。
