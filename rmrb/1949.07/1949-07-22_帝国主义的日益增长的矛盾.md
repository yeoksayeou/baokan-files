　　The Growing Contradictions of Imperialism
　　Written by Doudé, Vice Chairman of the British Communist Party, translated by Fuying

　　I. The Period of Temporary Stabilization of Capitalism After World War I

　　The general crisis of capitalism continues to develop at an accelerated pace, and has now lasted for nearly thirty-five years. The First World War proved that capitalism had reached the stage of monopoly, the stage of imperialism, the stage where the division of the world had been completed, and could no longer allow the productive forces it had liberated to continue to develop forward, but could only erupt into fierce, destructive conflicts to re-divide the world; therefore, it gave a fatal blow to all reformist illusions that hoped for peaceful forward development within capitalism, and created the conditions for the working class and its allies to realize the urgent task of overthrowing imperialism and completing the socialist revolution. The victory of the Great Socialist October Revolution in Russia and the fact that the new Soviet state withstood the imperialist offensive and stood tall was the first breach in the world system of capitalism and proved that the era of the socialist world revolution had begun. This is the nature of the beginning of the general crisis of capitalism.

　　By comparing the world situation after the Second World War with the world situation after the First World War, it can be seen that the general crisis of capitalism has been greatly deepened between the two world wars.

　　After the First World War, the leaders of imperialism did not realize the fatal blow their system had suffered. They regarded the First World War as an unexpected accidental obstacle on the normal path of development – Churchill called it a "sudden and violent event" in his "Boston Speech." They believed that the October Revolution was an uprising that could be controlled by military means. Even after their attempt to "strangle Bolshevism at its birth" had failed, they comforted themselves with the fact that the tide of world revolution had finally been suppressed elsewhere in the world (this was largely due to the help they received from the Social Democrats in the labor movement and the fact that there were no Bolshevik parties except in Russia). Since they could not eliminate the young Soviet Republic, they tried to isolate it from the rest of the world. They established a number of reactionary puppet states in Eastern Europe to form a "cordon sanitaire"; they organized the imperialist League of Nations, excluding the Soviet Union. The slogans they put forward were "return to normalcy" and "stabilization," etc.

　　They relied on the financial intervention of the United States to achieve temporary stability in Western and Central Europe. Afterwards, they attempted to spread the illusion of a new era of "democracy" and "peace," with the Social Democrats as their propagandists, Ford as their sponsor, and the "American miracle" as their model. Only when the conditions for temporary stability (during which the development of capitalism had an unbalanced, unstable, and limited rise) caused the most massive world economic panic in the history of capitalism, and it was centered in the location of the "American miracle," and the world economic depression caused new social and political agitation, the barbarism and terror of Fascism were chosen as useful weapons and grew by "civilized" imperialist monopolists, international competition resumed fiercely, military aggression, a frenzied arms race, and finally the Second World War – only experience proved that the general crisis of capitalism had clearly deepened, only then were the dreams of the 1920s shattered and awakened from many illusions.

　　II. The Situation After World War II is Very Different From That After World War I

　　Today, the situation after the Second World War is very different. The world system of imperialism has also been broken through in Eastern and Southeastern Europe. The Soviet Union is no longer isolated among nations, but has a solid alliance with a new type of country (which has also overthrown the shackles of imperialism and replaced the rule of exploiters with the rule of the working people). These new countries, these People's Democracies, represent the victorious national liberation of those countries that were once enslaved by Western imperialism and formed the "cordon sanitaire." The notorious "cordon sanitaire" has moved westward, now to Western Germany, France, and Britain – countries controlled by American imperialism.

　　The Soviet Union, tempered by the furnace of the fascist war, was not crushed or weakened as the Western imperialists had expected. Although it suffered enormous losses and destruction, its economic and political weight in the world has greatly increased, and the speed of its recovery and new construction has not only offset the losses of the war, but has also caused a change in the balance of power that is more favorable to socialism.

　　The situation in the vast areas of colonies and dependencies of imperialism in Asia and Africa has also undergone the same obvious changes. The victory of the democratic revolution in China against the Kuomintang government, which was funded and armed by the United States, is the biggest failure of imperialism since the collapse of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo, and the greatest victory of the people's liberation movement of the nation with the largest population in the world (accounting for one-fifth of humanity). The democratic victory in China has opened the way for the liberation of the whole of Asia. The struggle of the colonial people has created new countries, the Republics of Vietnam and Indonesia, who are fighting to maintain their independence and resist imperialist armed aggression. In other countries, such as Burma and Malaya, the struggle for freedom has reached the degree of a full-scale war of liberation. In other places, such as India and Ceylon, imperialism has to pretend to retreat and establish reactionary puppet governments as its vassals, and it takes such sophisticated political maneuvers to maintain its position; but in these places, the ruling class's use of violent means of oppression shows that a deep crisis is shaking the foundations of these governments that betray the nation. The scope of people's awareness and resistance throughout the African continent (where imperialism is attempting to make Africa its last fortress of hegemony and exploitation after losing Asia) foreshadows that the imperialist plan to make Africa its last fortress is doomed to fail, and the national liberation movement in African colonies will rapidly mature.

　　Within the working class, the change in the balance of power is equally profound. Following the weakening of imperialism and the basis of its super-profits, the foundation of the Social Democratic parties in the castles of the European continental countries has collapsed. Powerful, politically experienced, mass Communist parties, such as the Communist parties of France and Italy, hold the unquestionable leadership of the working class and come out to act as the leaders of the nation. The last remaining center of the bourgeois labor movement is concentrated in the countries of the Anglo-American bloc. In the United States and Britain, the slower political development means that the Social Democratic control over the labor movement (a control that paralyzes the labor movement) has yet to be broken. But when these centers, still controlled by the upper leadership of the imperialist Labor Party, attempt to use their toxic influence to attack the powerful World Federation of Trade Unions in order to undermine the world working class movement, they expose themselves as being in the extreme minority, and the World Federation of Trade Unions continues to move forward with the support of the overwhelming majority of the world's organized workers.

　　III. Uneven Capitalist Development Deepens Contradictions Among Imperialists

　　These new developments have increasingly weakened the foundation of imperialism. The collapse of German and Japanese imperialism has shrunk the foundation of imperialism; one-quarter of the world has broken free from the control of imperialism, further shrinking the foundation of imperialism. But within this shrunken world of imperialism, relationships have changed and are extremely unstable. The uneven development of capitalism has reached its highest point. War profits (concentrated in the hands of a few large monopoly groups) have made the economic and strategic power of American imperialism, which is bloated, surpass all other countries in the capitalist world. On the other hand, the main colonial empires are still in the hands of the older European imperialist powers. These older European imperialist powers, whose power has been greatly weakened and whose economies are fragmented, are not only due to the losses of the war and their relative economic and technological backwardness, but also due to the collapse of their colonial rule in Asia and Africa. The loot they had plundered from the colonies of Asia and Africa in the past constituted the basis of the pre-war imperialist "prosperity." In the past, rubber, tin, copper, and oil from the colonies enabled Western European countries to obtain U.S. dollars to buy things from the American continent. The beginning of the collapse of this foundation has plunged these Western European countries into a crisis of long-term deficits in international payments (especially a long-term shortage of U.S. dollars).

　　This new situation - the extreme imbalance of capitalist development, the dominance of American imperialism seeking world expansion, the weakening of the older Western European imperialist powers, coupled with the shrinking of the world's imperialist territory and the expansion of colonial revolutions - has made all attempts to establish a new equilibrium in imperialist relations after the Second World War unsuccessful.

　　American imperialism wants to break down all trade barriers that prevent it from expanding to other countries, while maintaining its own high tariffs, thus further exacerbating the world's economic imbalances. The capitalist countries of Europe, in a state of serious economic fragmentation, are attempting to restore their position by resorting to desperate extraordinary measures, placing unbearable burdens on the people's living standards and conducting colonial wars (which further deplete their economies). But these measures they have taken to restore their economic and political position have resulted in them becoming more economically, politically, and militarily dependent on American imperialism.

　　The expansion movement of American imperialism has developed through the following stages: the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the Atlantic Pact, military lend-lease, and President Truman's Point Four (Point Four is to seize the exploitation of the colonial empires of the European powers). The United States has set up agencies in all the countries of Europe that are beneficiaries of the Marshall Plan to direct and control all economic development. The United States prohibits trade between Western and Eastern Europe, preventing Europe's economic revival. The United States has established American military occupations in Britain and a series of countries. The vassal governments of Western Europe cannot even move a finger without obtaining the permission of the American authorities.

　　IV. Imperial Capitalism is Moving Towards Economic Panic and War

　　But neither American imperialism nor the Western European imperialisms can solve these new problems arising from this situation. The complete failure of the Marshall Plan, which was regarded as a plan for the "revival" of Europe, is obvious. The deepening of the economic disintegration and the decline of living standards in Marshallized Western Europe, in contrast to the brilliant success of construction and the improvement of living standards in Eastern Europe, is obvious to all. In Western Europe, Yorin, the Secretary-General of the Marshall Plan organization, has declared that by the time the Marshall "revival" is completed in 1952, Europe will face the prospect of economic collapse.

　　The shadow of economic panic looms over the capitalist world, and as this shadow grows, the instigation of war becomes increasingly open. Economic apologists for monopoly capital declare that rearmament is a means of preventing economic depression. Military spending has increased to unprecedented levels in peacetime, dwarfing even Hitler's rearmament program. The United States' military spending is twenty times that of pre-war levels, and the military spending of impoverished Britain is three times that of 1939 (the eve of World War II). A blatant movement of war provocation and war propaganda artificially creates an atmosphere of war hysteria; this is also used to achieve political goals, namely, to attack the working class and the democratic movement, and to adopt reactionary political measures.

　　Thus, the situation after the Second World War is clearly different from that after the First World War. Instead of proposing "normalcy," "stability," and "an era of peaceful democratic development," the leaders of imperialism openly spread chaos and war hysteria. Peace is denounced as dangerous, and the peace movement is denounced as a "communist conspiracy." Instead of supporting the United Nations as a tool for maintaining peace, the Atlantic Pact is negotiated as a regional war alliance to replace the United Nations. This war movement represents the deeper bankruptcy of imperialism and the inability of its representatives to solve its problems.

　　The measures taken today by the mad warmongering imperialists only deepen the general crisis of imperialism. The enormous burden of rearmament further disintegrates the economy. The colonial wars waged by the European imperialist powers to restore and expand their colonial plunder (as an indispensable basis for restoring their parasitic imperialist economies) only exacerbate the economic panic and increase their economic balance of payments deficits. Conflicts of interest between imperialists have not been eliminated by American hegemony, but have rather intensified.

　　However, these measures that exacerbate the contradictions of imperialism also simultaneously promote the awakening of the people and mobilize them to oppose the reactionary and war policies of imperialism. Those governments and parties that play the role of vassals of American imperialism, especially the Social Democrats, are discredited because they have betrayed national interests and national independence, and because they cannot meet the people's urgent economic demands. The crude and blatant interference of American imperialism has awakened and expanded the spirit of national resistance, which is embodied in the movements of the Communist parties in various countries.

　　The growing social and political struggle is a manifestation of the increasingly acute crisis of capitalism; this social and political struggle reached its climax on the May Day Labor Day of 1949. The imperialists are advancing along the road towards economic panic and war, while also fearing economic panic and war, because they see the prospect of their system being further weakened and ultimately overthrown. The people's camp is fighting forward for democracy and peace, for the future victory of the working class and socialism. The increasingly acute crisis of capitalism is manifested at the present stage in the struggle between the world's two major camps today.

　　帝国主义的日益增长的矛盾
    英国共产党副主席杜德著·福英译
    一、资本主义在第一次世界大战后尚暂时稳定时期
    资本主义底总危机，以加速度继续发展着，到现在已将近三十五年了。第一次世界大战证明了资本主义达到了独占底阶段、帝国主义底阶段、世界瓜分已完成的阶段，就再也不能使它所解放出来的生产力继续向前发展，而只能爆发成为剧烈的、破坏性的、重新瓜分世界的冲突；因此，给一切希望在资本主义内和平向前发展的改良主义的幻想以致命的打击，并创造了使劳动阶级及其同盟者觉悟到要负起推翻帝国主义及完成社会主义革命之紧迫任务的条件。俄国伟大的社会主义的十月革命底胜利以及新苏维埃国家挡住了帝国主义底进攻而屹然存在，是资本主义底世界体系之第一个缺口，并且证明了社会主义世界革命底时代已经开始。这就是资本主义总危机底开始底性质。
    只要将第二次世界大战后的世界形势与第一次大战后的世界形势相比较，就可看出资本主义总危机在两次世界大战之间是大大地深刻化了。
    在第一次世界大战之后，帝国主义底领袖们尚没有认识到他们的制度所遭受的致命打击。他们认为第一次世界大战是正常的发展道路上的一个出乎意料之外的偶然的阻碍，——邱吉尔在其“波士顿演说”中称之为“骤然而来的剧烈的事件”。他们认为十月革命是用军事手段就可以控制得住的一个暴动。甚至在他们企图“当布尔塞维克主义刚产生时就将其扼杀”已告失败之后，他们尚以在世界别处世界革命浪潮终于被镇压下去（这大部分是归因于他们获得了劳动运动中的社会民主党底帮助以及除俄国之外尚没有布尔塞维克的政党），聊自告慰。他们既不能消灭年青的苏维埃共和国，乃企图将其与世界别处隔断。他们在东欧建立了许多反动的傀儡国家，组成一“隔绝地带”；他们组织了帝国主义的国际联盟，把苏联排除在外。他们所提出的口号是“恢复常态”，“稳定”等。
    他们依靠美国的金融的干涉，以实现西欧和中欧的暂时的稳定。之后，乃企图散布“民主”与“和平”底新时代底幻想，以社会民主党为其宣传者，以福特为其赞助者，以“美国的奇迹”为其模范。只有当暂时的稳定（在暂时的稳定时资本主义的发展有不平衡的、不稳定的、有限度的上升）底条件引起了资本主义历史中最巨大的世界经济恐慌，而且是以“美国的奇迹”的所在地为中心，世界经济大恐慌又引起了新的社会的和政治的激动，法西斯的野蛮和恐怖被“文明的”帝国主义的独占资本家选为合用的武器而增长，国际的竞争复告剧烈，军事的侵略，疯狂的军备竞赛，卒成第二次世界大战——只有经验证明了资本主义总危机显已加深时，才把二十年代底梦想打得粉碎，才从许多幻想恍然醒悟过来。
    二、第二次世界大战后的情形与第一次大战后大异
    今天在第二次世界大战后的情形就大大不同。帝国主义底世界体系在东欧和东南欧也被冲破。苏联在各国间已不再是孤立了，而是有一些新型的国家（它们也已推翻了帝国主义底束缚并以劳动人民底统治代替剥削者底统治）为坚固的联盟者。这些新国家，这些人民民主国，表示着过去被西方帝国主义所奴役而被组成“隔绝地带”的那些国家底民族解放已获得胜利。臭名昭彰的“隔绝地带”已向西移，现在已移到德国西部、法国、英国——这些被美国帝国主义所控制的国家。
    苏联经过了法西斯战争底洪炉之锻炼，并没有象西方帝国主义者所预期那样的被粉碎、被削弱，它虽然蒙受了极大的损失和破坏，但它在世界底经济的和政治的力量比重上是大大增加，而其恢复和新建设的速度，不仅是抵消了战争底损失，而且使在力量对比上发生更有利于社会主义的变动。
    帝国主义在亚洲和非洲的殖民地和属国底广大地区，情形也发生了同样明显的变更，中国的反对美国资助和美国武装的蒋介石政府的民主革命底胜利，是帝国主义自希特勒、墨索里尼、和东条崩溃以来的最大的失败，是世界人口最多（占人类五分之一）的民族底人民解放运动底最伟大的胜利。中国的民主主义的胜利，开辟了整个亚洲解放之道路。殖民地的人民底斗争，创造了新的国家，越南和印尼共和国，他们在进行战斗以保持他们的独立，抵抗帝国主义底武装进攻。在其他的国度，如象缅甸和马来，争取自由的斗争已达到十足的解放战争底度。在另外的地方，如象印度和锡兰，帝国主义要假装撤退，建立反动的傀儡政府，为其附庸，要这么精巧的政治的手腕，才能保持其地位；但在这些地方，由统治阶级之使用暴力的压迫手段，就可看出深刻的危机正在震撼着这些出卖民族的政府底基础。在非洲大陆（帝国主义企图在丧失亚洲之后，以非洲为其霸权和剥削底最后堡垒）各地的人民觉悟和反抗底范围，已预示帝国主义希望以非洲为最后堡垒的计划是注定失败，非洲殖民地的民族解放运动将迅速成熟。
    在工人阶级内部，力量对比的变化也同样深刻。跟着帝国主义及其超利润底基础之削弱，在欧洲的大陆诸国的城堡垒社会民主党底基础就崩溃了。强大的、富有政治经验的、群众性的共产党，如法国和意大利的共产党，掌握着工人阶级底毫无疑问的领导权，而且出来充当民族底领导者。资产阶级的劳动运动底最后剩留下来的中心，是集中于英美集团底诸国中，在美国和英国，政治发展之较缓，意味着社会民主党对于劳动运动之控制（控制得使劳动运动麻痹了）尚有待打破。但当这些仍然为帝国主义的工党上层领导所控制的中心，企图运用其有毒的影响，向强大的世界职工会联盟进攻，以破坏世界工人阶级运动时，就暴露出他们是占极少数，世界职工会联盟获得了世界底有组织的工人底压倒的多数之拥护而继续前进。
    三、资本主义发展不平衡加深了帝国主义者间的矛盾
    这些新的发展，使帝国主义底基础日益削弱。德国和日本帝国主义底崩溃，已使帝国主义底基础缩小；世界底四分之一，摆脱了帝国主义底控制，使帝国主义底基础更加缩小。但在这已缩小了的帝国主义的世界之内，关系发生了变化，极度不稳定。资本主义发展不平衡，已达最高点。战争利润（集中于少数大独占集团之手）使其胀胖的美国帝国主义底经济的和战略的力量，超过了资本主义世界底其他一切国家。在另一方面，主要的殖民地帝国却仍然在较老的欧洲的帝国主义强国之手里。这些较老的欧洲的帝国主义强国，其力量大大削弱，其经济则支离破碎，这不仅是由于战争底损失和它们的经济底技术上的相对的落后，但也由于它们在亚洲非洲的殖民地统治权底崩溃。它们过去从亚洲非洲殖民地所抢掠的赃物，构成战前帝国主义的“繁荣”底基础。从前，来自殖民地的橡皮、锡、铜和石油，使西欧诸国得到美元以向美洲大陆购买东西。这一基础之开始崩溃，使得这些西欧国家陷于国际收支长期赤字（尤其是长期的美元缺乏）底危机。
    这一新的情况——资本主义发展极端不平衡，企求世界扩张的美帝国主义占优势，较老的西欧的帝国主义强国底削弱，再加上帝国主义底世界地盘之缩小，殖民地革命之扩张，使得第二次世界大战后一切企图建立帝国主义的关系底新的均衡，都不成功。
    美帝国主义想法打破一切阻止它向别国扩张的贸易壁垒，而同时却保持它自己的高的关税，因是这世界的经济的不均衡更甚。欧洲的资本主义国家，处于严重的经济的破碎的情况，企图以孤注一掷的非常的措施，对人民底生活程度加以力不胜任的负担并进行殖民地战争（这使其经济更枯竭），以谋恢复其地位。但它们为恢复其经济的和政治的地位而采取的这些措施，其结果使它们在经济上、政治上和军事上更加依赖于美帝国主义。
    美帝国主义底扩张运动，是经过下列诸阶段而发展的：杜鲁门主义、马歇尔计划、大西洋协约、军事的租借、杜鲁门总统底第四点（第四点是要夺得欧洲列强底殖民地帝国底剥削）。美国在欧洲的马歇尔计划受援国底诸国都中，都设有机关来指挥和控制一切经济发展。美国禁止西欧与东欧之间的贸易，阻止欧洲底经济复兴。美国在英国和一连串国家建立美国的军事占领。西欧的附庸政府，没有获得美国当局底允许，连手指都不能动。
    四、资本帝国主义正朝向经济恐慌与战争前进
    但不论美帝国主义或西欧诸帝国主义，都不能解决由这情况所发生这些新的问题。被视为欧洲“复兴”计划的马歇尔计划，其完全失败已很明显。马歇尔化的西欧底经济脱节加深和生活程度降低，与东欧底建设辉煌的成功和生活程度提高，这一对照是众所共见的。在西欧，马歇尔计划组织底秘书长约林已宣称：到一九五二年马歇尔“复兴”告成时，欧洲将面临经济崩溃底前途。
    经济恐慌底阴影笼罩着资本主义世界，跟着这阴影之长大，挑拨战争也就日益公开。独占资本底经济辩护专门家就宣称重整军备是防止经济萧条之手段。军备用费增高到和平时期空前的高度，令希特勒底重整军备计划也相形见拙。美国的军费达战前之二十倍，而穷了的英国底军费也达一九三九年（第二次世界大战底前夕）水平之三倍。肆无忌惮的战争挑拨与战争宣传底运动，人工造成战争歇斯的里底气氛；这也被用来达到政治的目的，即，攻击工人阶级和民主运动，与采取反动的政治措施。
    这样看来，第二次世界大战后的形势是与第一次世界大战后的形势显然不同。不是提出“常态”，“稳定”，“和平的民主的发展底时代”，帝国主义底领袖们公开散布纷乱与战争歇斯的里。和平被指斥为危险，和平运动被指斥为“共产党阴谋”。不是拥护联合国作为维持和平之工具，而是议订大西洋协约，作为区域性的战争联盟，以它来代替联合国。这一战争运动，是表示帝国主义底破产更加深刻化及其代表之没有能力解决其问题。
    疯狂的热中战争的帝国主义者今天所采取的措施，只是更加深帝国主义总危机。重整军备底奇巨负担使经济更瓦解。欧洲帝国主义列强为恢复和扩大其殖民地掠夺（作为恢复其寄生的帝国主义经济之不可缺的基础）而进行殖民地战争，其结果只是使经济恐慌加剧，使其经济收支的赤字更大。帝国主义间的利益冲突，并没有因美国的称霸而消灭，但反而加甚。
    但是，使帝国主义底矛盾加剧的这些措施，同时又促进了人民底觉悟与动员他们起来反对帝国主义的反动和战争政策。扮演为美帝国主义底附庸角色的那些政府和政党，尤其是社会民主党，由于他们出卖了民族利益和民族独立，也由于他们不能满足人民底紧迫经济要求，乃声名狼籍。美帝国主义底粗暴的和露骨的干涉，唤起了和扩大了民族抵抗精神，这种精神体现于各国共产党底运动。
    日益发展的社会的和政治的斗争，是资本主义底日益尖锐的危机底表现；这种社会的和政治的斗争在一九四九年五一劳动节达其高潮。帝国主义者循着朝向经济恐慌和战争的道路前进，同时又怕经济恐慌和战争，因为他们看到他们的制度有更加削弱和最后倾覆之前途。人民阵营则为民主和和平、为工人阶级和社会主义底未来胜利而战斗前进。资本主义底日益尖锐的危机，在现阶段就表现于今天的世界两大阵营之斗争。
