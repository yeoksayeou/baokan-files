Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 10th: TASS reports: Since late June, the Warsaw Military Tribunal has been trying the case of Adam Doboczynski, an American and British spy. He was arrested in July 1947. According to the indictment, shortly after Hitler seized power in February 1933, Doboczynski contacted the German intelligence service and was tasked with providing it with regular intelligence on the situation in Poland, as well as conducting propaganda for so-called ideological rapprochement between Poland and Nazi Germany. In late 1945, his connection with the German intelligence service was severed, and he began serving American imperialism. Doboczynski established contact with the Vatican and organizations led by the Vatican to oppose people's democracy. In 1945, he participated in extensive activities of the "Central and Eastern European Federation Club" (an agent of the American and British imperialist bloc). In 1946, while in Munich, Doboczynski contacted Polish fascists - Bogan, Todleben, Irakowicz, Kozlowski - and learned from Kozlowski Alexander that the Munich core and the "Polish organization" were cooperating with the American intelligence service, and that Poland had an intelligence network working directly under the guidance of the American intelligence service. Kozlowski Alexander also told Doboczynski that in his espionage activities, he contacted the German intelligence service through General Guderian, which was subordinate to the American Central Intelligence Agency. In his confession, the defendant spoke of three reasons for his coming to Poland: instructions from Beresovsky (the "Minister of the Interior" of the Polish exile "government"), instructions from Alexander, and private matters. When the defendant spoke of his relationship with Alexander (who promised to support him in the American intelligence service), he said: "Alexander wanted to set up a dedicated radio station for me in Poland. I came here to enhance my political prestige."
