　　Three Folk Rhymes
　　Liu Zhensheng
　　One,
　
    White horse cart, clatter-clatter,
    The daughter from the east neighbor returned to her mother’s home.
    The father came out, carrying a bundle;
    The mother came out, holding a baby;
    The sister-in-law and brother came out laughing:
    "Sister, sister, you're being too polite,
    This isn't a stranger's home,
    Bringing both steamed buns and noodles,
    And also pulling half a cart of big winter melons."
　
    "Don't laugh at me, sister-in-law and brother,
    This year is different from previous years,
    The allotted garden land has plenty of fertilizer,
    And grows good crops all over.
    Just waiting to return to mother’s home after the autumn harvest,
    With both peanuts and cotton!"
　
　　Two,
　
    Great production, great production,
    Every young person wears a white shirt,
    Men and women are all producing,
    Even unmarried girls are going to the fields!
    Watering half a field south of the village,
    White faces are all rosy red!
    "Little sister, little sister, you work so hard,
    You'll find a good husband after the autumn harvest!"
　
　　Three,
　
    Work teams, like a swarm of bees,
    With old and young, and youth,
    Go to the west of the village, turn to the south of the village,
    Finishing the work for every household,
    Talking and laughing,
    Not feeling tired, working happily!
    If you ask who promoted this method,
    It's the people's leader, Chairman Mao!

　　农谣三首
    刘振声
　　一、
　
    白马车，哗啦啦，
    东邻的闺女回了娘家。
    爹出来，背包袱；
    娘出来，抱娃娃；
    嫂嫂哥哥出来笑哈哈：
    “妹妹，妹妹真见外，
    这又不是外人家，
    又送馍来又送面，
    还拉来半车大北瓜。”
　
    “嫂嫂哥哥别见笑，
    今年不同往年价，
    分下的园地粪土大，
    长了满地的好庄稼。
    单等过秋回娘家，
    又是花生又是棉花！”
　
　　二、
　
    大生产，生产大，
    年青人个个穿白褂，
    男的女的都生产，
    没娶的闺女也下地啦！
    村南浇上半天地，
    白白（儿）脸蛋红答答！
    “小妹小妹你好劳动，
    过秋找上个好婆家！”
　
　　三、
　
    拨工队，一窝蜂，
    有老有小有青年，
    上村西，转村南，
    家家的活儿干个完，
    又有说，又有笑，
    不觉累来干的欢！
    要问这办法谁发扬的，
    人民的领袖毛主席！
