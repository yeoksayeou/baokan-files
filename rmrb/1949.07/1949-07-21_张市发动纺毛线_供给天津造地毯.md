　　Zhangjiakou Launches Wool Spinning
  　Supplying Tianjin for Carpet Production

　　[Chahar News] Chahar Province is a wool-producing region, and Zhangjiakou is its distribution center. In the past, raw wool was exported without being sorted or inspected, allowing unscrupulous merchants to mix in sand and soil for illegal profits (some even adding soil up to 60 or 70 percent), causing a loss of credibility and sluggish sales, affecting exports. The Provincial Government's Industry and Commerce Department previously conducted investigations in Tianjin and learned that carpet exports were gradually booming. There are now more than 200 carpet manufacturers, requiring approximately 250,000 to 260,000 catties of carpet yarn each month. Apart from a portion supplied by Beijing and Tianjin, raw materials are in short supply. Renli Company alone requires 150,000 catties per month. Therefore, it was decided to initially develop the wool processing industry in Zhangjiakou. The Zhangjiakou City Supply and Marketing Cooperative has signed a contract with Renli Company to spin 10,000 catties of yarn in July as a preliminary trial. The Zhangjiakou City Supply and Marketing Cooperative is now mobilizing and organizing women to spin carpet yarn by hand to supply Tianjin for carpet manufacturing. This will not only develop the wool textile industry, allowing Chahar Province's special wool products to be exported in large quantities, but also promote women's production.

　　Note: The carpet handicraft industry developed earliest and is most prosperous in Beijing and Tianjin, and is the center of the carpet industry. The industry is divided into men's carpets and women's carpets. Men's carpets are also called plush carpets, which are finely made and of high quality. Each worker produces about one square foot per day, and the current cost is about 2,000 yuan. In the past, 90 percent were sold to Europe and the United States. Women's carpets, or needlepoint carpets, use waste wool as raw material, and the finished products are particularly inexpensive and widely sold to Europe, the United States, the Philippines, and Australia, with large annual export figures. In the past, women's carpets were all embroidered by hand, producing three to four square feet per worker per day. Recently, a machine needle is used to embroider with thread, producing ten to fifteen square feet per worker per day, greatly increasing production. Each square foot is worth 400 to 500 yuan. Tianjin alone can produce more than 300,000 square feet per month, all of which can be exported. Approximately 250,000 catties of carpet yarn are required each month, and the raw materials used are mostly Chahar Province wool. Therefore, the development of the Tianjin carpet industry is directly related to Chahar Province.

　　张市发动纺毛线
  　供给天津造地毯
    【察哈尔讯】察省是羊毛出产地区，张家口为集散地。过去都是原毛出口，既不整装，又不检查，奸商从中掺砂混土，非法谋利（竟有掺土到百分之六、七十的），致使信用扫地，销路滞涩，影响出口。省政府工商处前曾至天津调查，了解到地毯出口逐渐畅旺。现已有厂家二百多户，每月即需用地毯毛线约计二十五、六万斤，除平津供给一部分外，原料甚感缺乏，只仁立公司一家，每月即需十五万斤。为此决定最近在张家口首先开展羊毛加工业。现张市供销合作总社已与仁立公司订立合同：七月份规定纺毛线一万斤，作为初步试办。现张家口市供销合作总社正发动组织纺妇，纺制地毯手工毛线，供给天津制造地毯。这样，不但发展了毛织工业，使察省特产的羊毛得以大量出口，妇女生产也可得到发展。
    按：地毯手工业平津发达最早，且为地毯工业的中心。该业分男工地毯，和女工地毯两种；男工地毯也叫栽绒地毯，制作精细，品质高贵，每工日做一方英尺左右，目前成本约须两千元上下。过去百分之九十运销欧美。女工地毯即挑花地毯，原料是利用废毛，成品价格特廉，广销欧美、菲、澳洲各国，每年出口数字很大。过去女工地毯全系用手工挑花，每工日产三、四方英尺。近来使用一种机器针带线刺花，每工日产十至十五方英尺，生产量大增。每方尺价值四、五百元。天津一地每月可生产三十多万方英尺，都能出口。每月需用地毯毛线二十五万斤上下，所用原料大都是察省羊毛。因此天津地毯业之发展，实与察哈尔省有直接关系。
