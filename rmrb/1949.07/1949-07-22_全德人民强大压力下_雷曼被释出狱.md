Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 21st: According to a France-Presse dispatch from Dusseldorf: Under the strong pressure of the movement by the entire German people demanding the release of Lehmann, the British occupation authorities in Germany released Lehmann, the chairman of the West German Communist Party, from prison on the 20th. TASS previously reported: The movement in East and West Germany demanding the release of Lehmann has penetrated all levels of the people, and even those who have been politically indifferent have taken action. This massive scale has deeply frightened the West German occupation authorities. Some days ago, they planned to find an excuse to release Lehmann without losing face, thereby extricating themselves from the embarrassing situation caused by Lehmann's arrest.

    雷曼被释出狱
    【新华社北平二十一日电】据法新社杜塞尔多夫消息：在全德人民要求释放雷曼运动的强大压力下，德境英国占领当局已于二十日将西德共产党主席雷曼释放出狱。塔斯社前此报道：东西德要求释放雷曼的运动，深入到人民的各阶层，连迄今在政治上表现淡漠的人都行动起来，这种壮大的规模，使西德占领当局深感惊惧。若干日子以前，他们即计划寻找借口，以便不失面子地释放雷曼从而使自己脱出因逮捕雷曼而陷入的狼狈境地。
