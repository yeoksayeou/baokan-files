Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: Moscow dispatch: The "Medical Worker," the organ of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, announced on the 15th that engineers in Sverdlovsk have invented a device that restores sight to the blind. This device weighs only 500 grams (equivalent to one Chinese catty). It can convert light waves and sound waves and transmit them to the blind. A war veteran blinded in the Battle of Stalingrad recently underwent a trial, and the results were very successful. Using this device, these blind people were able to distinguish the color of clothing and the color and quantity of tea in a glass. The Ministry of Social Security of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic has now begun mass production of this device.
