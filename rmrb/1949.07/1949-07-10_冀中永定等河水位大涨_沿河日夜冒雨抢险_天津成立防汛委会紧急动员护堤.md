【Baoding Dispatch】 Continuous heavy rain in various parts of central Hebei has caused flash floods, with the Yongding, Daqing, and Nan Yun rivers surging rapidly. The water level in the upper reaches of the Hutuo River has been rising repeatedly. On the afternoon of the 8th, the flood peak passed through Wuji and reached Xinying in Anping, overflowing the river channel. The water level in the Mudao Ditch in Wuji rose by four and a half feet. At 5:00 PM, a 5-zhang (approximately 16.7 meters) long breach occurred in the right bank of the Tianzhuang dike in Wuji due to overflowing. The water level in the upper reaches of the Zhulong River rose by more than two feet. Currently, flood control headquarters have been established in all counties along the rivers in central Hebei, concentrating forces to form rescue teams, braving the rain day and night on the dikes, battling fiercely against the floods.

【Tianjin Dispatch】 Due to the impact of upstream rainfall, the water levels of various rivers in Tianjin have been rising sharply during the day. At 5:30 PM yesterday, the water level of the Ziya River had reached the warning level (4.3 meters). The city's flood control committee is actively planning and preparing for various emergency rescue works, and calling on citizens throughout the city to be vigilant, especially residents along the rivers, to spontaneously organize and protect the river dikes.

【Central Hebei Dispatch】 With the Zhulong and Hutuo rivers rising rapidly, the Central Hebei Water Conservancy Bureau and the Ninth Prefectural Commissioner's Office Flood Control Work Team set out in the rain to supervise flood control work in various places. Due to continuous overcast and rainy weather on the 3rd and 4th of this month, the Zhulong River rose by four feet; the Mudao Ditch rose by three feet, and the Hutuo River was already eight feet deep and continuing to rise. Based on the water situation, the Ninth District Party Committee and the Commissioner's Office immediately convened a meeting of party, government, military, and civilian organizations in the district, and dispatched 28 cadres to form a flood control work team on the morning of the 4th. Led personally by Commissioner Yang, they braved the rain to set out for eight counties, including Anping, Shenze, and Raoyang, to provide supervision. Each county immediately established and improved various flood control organizations, prepared flood control materials, and universally inspected and repaired the dikes. They also promptly reported to higher authorities. At the same time, based on the water conditions of various rivers, the Central Hebei Water Conservancy Bureau has dispatched key cadres such as the bureau's technical assistant and the head of the general affairs section to various dike sections of the Hutuo River, Zhulong River, and Ziya River to provide specific guidance for flood control work.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th. The Tianjin Municipal Engineering Bureau, the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, and other relevant departments formed the Tianjin Municipal Flood Control Committee on the 6th, and adopted joint flood control measures for emergency periods. The committee believes that, based on the historical water rise situation of various rivers upstream, this year is a period of flooding, so flood control work is extremely important. In addition to deciding to speed up the construction of unfinished flood control projects, the committee also organized an inspection team to begin inspecting various flood control projects throughout the city starting on the 12th; at the same time, it instructed various units to investigate various flood control and rescue materials separately and strengthen preparations.

Tianjin is located at the confluence of rivers from Hebei and Chahar provinces. According to the past flood situations in Tianjin, there is approximately a ten-year flood cycle. Before the liberation of this city, the large embankment was severely damaged by the Kuomintang bandit army, and many dikes in the city and the river channel of the Xin Kai River were also damaged or silted up. After liberation, the People's Government Engineering Bureau actively deployed flood control work, and at the end of May, it formulated a flood control project plan. After more than a month of construction, most of these projects have now been completed, and it is expected that they will all be completed by the middle of this month.

　　冀中永定等河水位大涨
  　沿河日夜冒雨抢险
    天津成立防汛委会紧急动员护堤
    【保定专电】冀中各地，伏雨连绵，山洪暴发，永定、大清、南运各河猛涨。滹沱河上游水位一再增高。八日下午水头经过无极到达安平辛营，漫出河槽。无极木刀沟水位增高四尺半。无极田庄右堤在下午五点钟发生五丈长漫堤决口。潴龙河上游水位增高二尺多。现在冀中沿河各县防汛指挥部全都成立，集中力量组成抢险队，日夜冒雨上堤，正与洪水拼命搏斗。
    【天津专电】天津各河因受上游降雨的影响，日内水位直线上涨。昨日下午五时半，子牙河水位已达警戒水位（四·三公尺）。该市防汛委员会正积极筹划准备紧急时期各项抢险工作，并号召全市市民提高警惕，尤其是沿河居民，自动组织起来保护河堤。
    【冀中电】潴龙、滹沱河水猛涨，冀中水利局及九专署防汛工作队，冒雨出发督导各地防汛工作。在本月三、四两日阴雨连绵，潴龙河水涨四尺；木刀沟水涨三尺，滹沱河已水深八尺，现仍在继续上涨。根据水情，九地委和专署立即召集专区党政军民各机关会议，抽调干部二十八人，于四日上午组成防汛工作队，由杨专员亲自带领冒雨出发，分赴安平、深泽、饶阳等八县督导。各县立即建立与健全各种防汛组织，备齐防汛材料，普遍检查修理各堤。并及时向上汇报，同时冀中水利局根据各河水势，已抽调水利局技佐、总务科长等主要干部，分赴滹沱河、潴龙河、子牙河各堤段具体指导防汛工作。
    【新华社天津九日电】津市工务局、华北水利工程局等有关部门已于六日组成天津市防汛委员会，并通过紧急时期联合防汛办法。该会认为：按照上游各河历年涨水情形，今年是泛滥周期，故防汛工作极为重要。该会除决定加紧修建未完成的防汛工程外，并组织检查队，自十二日起开始检查全市各防汛工程；同时，责成各单位分别调查各项防汛抢险材料，加强准备。
    按津市位居冀察两省各河之汇集处，根据津市历次洪水泛滥情况，大约每十年为一泛滥周期。本市解放前，大围堤曾遭国民党匪军严重破坏，市内各堤及新开河河槽亦多损毁或淤塞。解放后，人民政府工务局即积极布置防汛工作，并于五月底拟定防汛工程计划，经月余修建，现此项工程已大部竣工，预计本月中旬可全部完成。
