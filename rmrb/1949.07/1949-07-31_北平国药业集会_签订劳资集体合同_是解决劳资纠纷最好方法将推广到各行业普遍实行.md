　　Peiping National Pharmaceutical Industry Convenes
  　Signing of Labor-Management Collective Contract
    Best Method for Resolving Labor Disputes to be Promoted and Universally Implemented in Various Industries
    [Our Newspaper] The Peiping Municipal National Pharmaceutical Industry Labor-Management Collective Contract Signing and Approval Conference was held yesterday morning (July 30th) at 9:00 AM at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Labor Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Industry and Commerce Bureau and other agencies, representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, various industries, and local trade union workers, as well as representatives from both labor and management in the national pharmaceutical industry, totaling more than 200 people, attended. Comrade Ma Guangdou of the Labor Bureau, who presided over the meeting, reported on the significance of the meeting, explaining that the National Pharmaceutical Industry Labor-Management Collective Contract had been drafted after the Labor Bureau solicited opinions from relevant departments and formed a review meeting, undergoing revisions to the text and procedures. It basically respects the opinions of both labor and management and is suitable for large, medium, and small pharmacies. It is hoped that this contract can be jointly observed by both labor and management to develop production and build a new China. After the chairman finished his speech, he began to read the full text of the collective contract. Subsequently, seven labor representatives, including Wang Jinzhang and Tang Jifu, and ten management representatives, including Liu Yifeng and Le Shaoyu, signed and sealed the contract. Comrade Shi Huaibi, Director of the Labor Bureau, then officially announced the approval of this contract on behalf of the Labor Bureau and, after explaining the process of signing the collective contract, affirmed and pointed out that: Utilizing the collective contract method is the best way to resolve labor disputes and is the basis for the concrete implementation of the policy of benefiting both labor and management. Therefore, (1) In the future, the National Pharmaceutical Industry Labor-Management Collective Contract will be introduced and promoted so that various industries can universally sign collective contracts. (2) The National Pharmaceutical Industry Collective Contract was drafted after careful and detailed research and discussion by both labor and management. Each pharmacy should formulate its own contract based on the spirit of the collective contract and should submit it to the Labor Bureau for record. (3) The collective contract must be faithfully implemented and must not be violated; otherwise, it is equivalent to violating government laws and regulations. In the future, if it is necessary to change the contract due to objective circumstances, both labor and management must go through formal procedures and be approved by the government before it can take effect. According to the feedback from both labor and management on this contract, labor believes that the past feudal management system has been completely abolished, and employees' social, political, and cultural activities have been given concrete guarantees; working hours and holidays have also been clearly stipulated, especially the status of apprentices and female workers has been raised. Management believes that the wage system not only conforms to the principle of benefiting both labor and management, but also can promote production enthusiasm. At the same time, because management's right to command and decide within the scope of business, as well as the right to hire and fire employees, are guaranteed, they have developed an interest in operating the business and have confidence.

　　北平国药业集会
  　签订劳资集体合同
    是解决劳资纠纷最好方法将推广到各行业普遍实行
    【本报讯】北平市国药业劳资集体合同签定批准大会于昨（三十日）晨九时假市商会举行。到全国总工会、劳动局、市总工会、工商局等机关代表，市商会、各行业、各地工会工作者等代表及国药业劳资双方代表共二百余人。主席劳动局马光斗同志报告开会意义，说明国药业劳资集体合同经过劳动局向有关部门征求意见，并组审查会议，经过文字和程序的修改，在基本上尊重劳资双方意见而拟定，适合于大、中、小各药店的情形，希望此合同能出劳资双方共同遵守，发展生产，建设新中国。主席致词毕，开始宣读集体合同全文。继由劳方代表王锦章、唐吉甫等七人，资方代表刘一峰、乐绍虞等十人签字盖章。劳动局长史怀璧同志即代表劳动局正式宣布批准此项合同，并阐释集体合同签定经过后，肯定指出：利用集体合同方式是解决劳资纠纷的最好的方法，是具体执行劳资两利政策的根据，因此，（一）今后要将国药业劳资集体合同介绍推广，使各行业普遍签定集体合同。（二）国药业集体合同是经过劳资双方慎重详细地研究讨论以后拟定的，各药店应根据集体合同精神，分别制定本店的合同，并应呈请劳动局备案。（三）对于集体合同要忠诚执行，不得违背，否则即等于违背政府法令。今后如因客观情况需要改变合同时，劳资双方必须经过正式手续，并经政府批准后始能有效。根据劳资双方对于此次合同的反映，劳方认为过去的封建管理制度是彻底取消了，职工的社会、政治、文化活动，都获得确切的保障；工作时间和休假日期也有了明文规定，尤其学徒和女工地位提高。资方认为工资制度不仅符合劳资两利的原则精神，而且可以促进生产情绪。同时，资方因为在业务范围内的指挥权、决定权，以及添雇解雇职工权获得保障，因而对经营业务发生兴趣并有了信心。
