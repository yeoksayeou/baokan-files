    Father's Instructions
    Excerpt from letters home of South Work Corps trainees

    "Go Happily!"
    "I heard you are leaving soon, so go happily! As long as you hold the determination to seek welfare for workers, peasants, and all oppressed people, and work honestly, everywhere is home, and everywhere you can receive warmth like home. Once you leave, don't keep thinking about home... Work for the liberation of all of China and the construction of a new China... Bravely and happily welcome and overcome all difficulties!" This is a letter a father wrote to his son, who is participating in the South Work Corps and is about to go south. The times have changed. Young people, like petrels, fly high into the storm. Middle-aged people, who have always been squeezed by the old society like a large stone, are facing this storm and are determined to let their sons fly higher and further.

    "Don't write to me if you have no achievements."
    This is what Li Baolin's father—a Communist Party member—wrote to Li Baolin from the standpoint of a revolutionary comrade when Li Baolin was about to leave for the South. Li Baolin had been deceived into joining the Kuomintang reactionary organization, and he had concealed this from his father when he went to the South Work Corps. It was only after education from the South Work Corps that he frankly confessed his past. He wrote a letter to report to his father and expressed his determination to reform. His father sternly warned his son in this way: "Looking at your letter, you still commit the very serious exaggeration typical of the petty bourgeoisie. Revolutionaries must undergo long-term self-struggle and arduous training. It is absolutely not something that can take effect with a momentary determination as you said. From the standpoint of a revolutionary comrade, I hope you will be honest, show infinite loyalty to the revolution and the people, study hard, abandon all concerns, and face the sins of the past squarely. If you have no achievements in your work going south, don't write to me." This father, who insisted on the Bolshevik principle of irreconcilability with his son's mistakes, concluded with this categorical statement: "I have no interest in people who talk empty words."

    "Hope you strive to run for the revolution"
    Xingji's father led a strike of 20,000 cotton mill workers in Qingdao twenty-five years ago—in 1924—. Finally, under the armed suppression of Japanese imperialism and the Northern Warlords, the strike was broken, dozens of workers were killed, and he was arrested. Xingji's father told his son, who was in the South Work Corps, all of this after Qingdao was liberated. He has seen his hopes for twenty-five years realized today. He wrote with great excitement: "Today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we are not threatened by imperialism and reactionaries. This is the day the people raise their heads, and the time for national rejuvenation. This was the intention when I named you at the time. Xingji, that is, the meaning of revitalizing the foundation of the motherland." Finally, the father educated his son with this patriotic spirit: "The foundation of the motherland should not be taken lightly... I hope you will strive to run for the revolution and build a glorious and splendid new China under the leadership of the People's Government, so as not to be ashamed of being born in China and growing up in China."

    "Take care of your health for the liberation of the people"
    From Shenyang, Kangning's father (an unemployed civil servant) wrote to his son who was going south, instructing him: "Your body is fat and you are prone to getting a fever and dizziness. The weather in the south is hot, so pay attention to hygiene. The responsibilities you take on are significant, and you must take good care of your health in order to liberate the people." Throughout this letter is deep paternal love and a high degree of enthusiasm for the people. Only by transcending ordinary narrow family father-son emotions and rising to a higher and broader universal love for the people, can this emotion be more profound and powerful, and can it inspire the son even more. The fathers of the new era already know how to advance with their sons.

    父亲的嘱咐
    摘录自南工团学员的家书
    “喜喜欢欢的走吧！”
    “听说你快走了，就喜喜欢欢的走吧！只要抱着为工人、为农民、为一切被压迫人群谋福利的决心，老老实实的去干，到处都是家，到处都能得到和家一样的温暖。你走了，就不要老想家……为解放全中国，建设新中国而工作……勇敢而愉快的去迎接和克服一切困难！”这是一位父亲写给他的参加南工团即将南下的儿子的一封信。时代变了，年青人象海燕一样迎着暴风雨高飞，被旧社会象大石头般一向榨压着的中年人面对着这暴风骤雨，也决心让儿子飞得更高一点，更远一点了。
    “没有功绩，不要给我来信。”
    这是李宝林的父亲——一个共产党员——以革命同志的立场在李宝林要出发南下时给他写的一句话。李宝林曾受人欺骗加入过国民党反动组织，他又隐瞒了他的父亲到南工团去。直到经过南工团教育，才使他坦白说出他的过去。他写信报告了他的父亲，并表示决心改过了。他父亲是这样严正地告诫着儿子的：“看来信，还犯着很严重的小资产阶级的夸大性。革命者是要经过长期的自我斗争和艰苦锻炼的，绝不是象你所说一朝一夕痛下决心就可见效。我以革命同志的立场，希望你老老实实，对革命，对人民表现无限忠诚，艰苦学习，撇弃一切顾虑，正视过去罪恶；如果在南下工作中没有功绩，不要给我来信”。这位与他的儿子的过失坚持着布尔什维克的不可调和的原则性的父亲，最后还这样斩钉截铁地说了一句：“说空话的人，我对他没有兴趣”。
    “望汝努力奔走革命”
    兴基的父亲在二十五年前——一九二四年——在青岛领导两万多纱厂工人罢工，终于在日本帝国主义和北洋军阀武力压制下，罢工被破坏，几十个工人被杀，他也被捕。这些，兴基的父亲到青岛解放后，都告诉了他的在南工团的儿子。他二十五年来的希望如今看到实现，他满怀兴奋地写着：“今日在毛主席领导下，不受帝国主义及反动派的威胁，这才是人民抬头之日，国家复兴之期。当日给你取名之时，即本此意。兴基，即振兴祖国基业之意”。最后，父亲是以这样的爱国主义精神教育着儿子：“祖国基业，且勿当轻……望汝努力奔走革命，在人民政府领导下，建设一个辉煌灿烂的新中国，不愧我们生在中国，长在中国”。
    “为求解放人群保重身体”
    从沈阳，康宁的父亲（失业的公务员），是这样来信叮嘱着他南下的儿子：“你身体肥胖，素易上火头晕，南方天热，要注意卫生。所负责任重大，还须为求解放人群善自保重你的身体”。贯串在这封信里的，是淳厚的父子之爱和对人民高度的热情，也只有超脱了普通狭隘的家庭父子感情而上升到更高级的更宽广的对于人民的博爱，这感情才更见深挚而有力，才能更使儿子感奋。新时代的父亲，已懂得怎样和儿子一起前进了。
