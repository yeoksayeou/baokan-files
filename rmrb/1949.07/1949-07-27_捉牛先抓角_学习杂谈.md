  　Random Thoughts on Learning
    We understand too little, and there is too much to learn. Generally speaking, we don't have enough time to study. Even at our jobs, we can only "squeeze" in time to learn, which is a contradiction. This contradiction cannot be resolved in a single morning.
    Marxism-Leninism is an extremely broad field of knowledge, and there are many books to read. "Extensive reading" can certainly enrich knowledge and broaden horizons, but in the current situation of busy work, it is not easy for ordinary comrades to do so. Many people feel that there are too many books to read because of the current work needs, which is a good phenomenon. However, if we do not proceed from reality, from the situation of ourselves and our units, if we do not read according to "possibility" and "necessity," if we do not read with a purpose and a plan, and if we want to "reach the sky in one step," the result of reading will be "eating without digesting" and pursuing formalism.
    It is very necessary to raise questions from the learning process of a book. It is useless to learn without being able to raise questions, just like sightseeing. Being able to raise questions means that the "machine" has been started, which is an important step in the learning process. Some comrades read a book on Marxism-Leninism and think, "I have understood all the words and sentences, and everything that needs to be said has been said in the book, so there are no questions!" This statement, unless he has truly fully understood it and reached the level of "mastery," only shows that his brain has not been opened and he has not "thought."
    Once questions are raised, they must be resolved. It is of little use to only raise questions without thinking about solving them.
    How to solve them? After the questions are raised, they must be classified. Distinguish between "major" and "minor," "general" and "specific," necessary and unnecessary to solve, those that can be solved now and those that cannot be solved temporarily... Then, through your own hard work, start the machine, learn to "be good at thinking," find reference books, first analyze and answer yourself, and then find someone to "ask for advice." It is not possible to just wait for ready-made answers and be a "lazy person."
    For example: When studying "The History of Social Development": Many questions can be raised. "Where did humans come from?" "How can apes turn into humans?" "Can today's monkeys turn into humans?" "Can ants turn into humans?" "Will humans in the future be immortal?" "What is the driving force of social development?" "How does the social relations of production change?" "What is the relationship between productive forces and relations of production?" "What are the characteristics of various social systems?" "What is the relationship between the foundation and the superstructure of social development?"... Obviously, many questions must be summarized and classified. "The general evolutionary process from ape to human" must be understood. Only by understanding this question can we establish the view that "labor creates mankind" and "labor creates the world." But if you daydream: "Can ants turn into humans?" "Can humans be immortal?" That is aimless learning, which will make you more and more confused, and it will be a waste of time. As for some questions in the specific process of evolution "from ape to human," some belong to the knowledge of biology, and some questions we still cannot understand, those questions can be temporarily left unsolved (of course, it would be better if they can be solved), because that does not greatly hinder the study of "The History of Social Development." If the questions raised are related to the basic questions of "The History of Social Development," such as "the driving force of social development," "productive forces and relations of production," especially the questions about capitalism, socialism, and new democracy, then we must spend more effort and think deeply. We must do this even more when we recently studied "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." We must grasp the key points and study them deeply. "Catch the ox by the horns" means "being good at discovering the most basic and most important things in each problem," which is one of Lenin's learning and working methods (see Krupskaya: How to Write Party Books for the Masses). It is also an important method for us to study theory. If you spend a long time focusing on "details" in learning, that is a great loss, and the result of splitting hairs will also lead to errors.
    Learning requires a high degree of enthusiasm, and learning requires correct methods.

### “捉牛先抓角”　学习杂谈

　　“捉牛先抓角”
    艾汀
  　学习杂谈
    我们懂的东西太少，要学的东西太多，一般的说，学习时间又不够，在工作岗位上甚至只能“挤”时间学习，这是一个矛盾。这个矛盾不可能在一个早晨解决的。
    马列主义是一门极其渊博的知识，要读的书很多，“博览群书”当然是可以丰富知识、扩大眼界，可是在目前工作忙迫的情况下，一般的同志不易做到。有许多人因为当前工作需要，感到要读的书太多，这是一个好现象。可是，若不从实际出发，从本人本单位的情况出发，不是按照“可能”和“必须”去读书，不是有目的有计划的去读书，要想“一步登天”，读书的结果，便会形成“食而不化”、追求形式。
    从一本书的学习过程中，提出问题是非常必要的。不能提出问题，走马看花的学习那是毫无用处。能够提出问题，说明已经“开动机器”，这是学习过程中重要的一步。有些同志看了一本马列主义的书，认为“字句皆已读懂，要讲的书本上皆已讲过，没有什么问题啦！”这种说法，除了他已真正全部领会并且达到“精通”的程度时，只是说明他的脑筋还没有打开，没有去“思索”。
    问题提出了，就要加以解决。光提出问题不去想法解决问题也是无大用处。
    如何解决？问题提出后，必须加以分类。分别“主要的”与“次要的”，“一般性的”与“个别的”，必要解决的与不必要解决的，眼前可以解决的与暂时不能解决的…。然后经过自己的艰苦努力，开动机器，学会“善于思索”，找参考书，先自己分析解答，再去找人“请教”。如果只等待现成的答案，自己做一个“懒汉”，是不行的。
    举例如：学习“社会发展史”：可以提出很多的问题。“人是那里来的？”“猿怎么能变成人？”“今天的猴子能不能变成人？”“蚂蚁能不能变成人？”“将来人，是不是能不死？”“社会发展的动力是什么？”“社会底生产关系是怎样改变的？”“生产力与生产关系的相互关系怎样？”“各种社会制度的特征是什么？”“社会发展的基础和上层建筑的关系怎样？”………显然，许许多多的问题中必须归纳分类。“从猿到人一般的进化过程”是必须了解的，只有了解到这一个问题才能确立“劳动创造人类”、“劳动创造世界”的观点。可是如果胡思乱想：“蚂蚁能不能变成人？”“人能不能不死”，那就是无目的的学习，那就愈“学”愈糊涂，那就是白白的浪费时间。至于“从猿到人”进化的具体过程中的若干问题，有些属于生物学的知识，我们有些问题还无法弄懂，那些问题就可以暂时不去解决（当然能够解决更好），因为那对学习“社会发展史”并无大妨碍。提出的问题若是关系到“社会发展史”的基本问题：如“社会发展的动力”、“生产力与生产关系”，特别是关于资本主义、社会主义、新民主主义社会中的诸问题，那就必须多化功夫，反复深思。我们最近学习“论人民民主专政”，更需如此，我们必须抓住关键深钻研。“捉牛先抓角”，就是“善于发现每个问题中最基本和最主要的东西”，是列宁的学习方法与工作方法之一（见克鲁普斯卡娅：怎样来写群众读的党的书籍一文）。对于我们学习理论也是一个重要的方法。假如在学习中化很长的时间去着重“细节”，那是一个很大的损失，钻牛角尖的结果也会导向错误。
    学习需要具有高度的热情，学习需要具有正确的方法。
