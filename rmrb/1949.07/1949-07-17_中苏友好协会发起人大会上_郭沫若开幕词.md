    [Ping City News] The full text of Guo Moruo's opening address at the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is as follows:
    Today, we, the Chinese delegation attending the World Peace Congress, as initial sponsors, have invited you to attend the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. We are very excited by your enthusiastic attendance.
    Our Chinese delegation has been back in the country for almost two months, and there are two unfinished tasks awaiting mature preparation. The first is the establishment of a branch of the World Peace Congress, and the second is the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, which we are initiating today.
    The world is clearly divided into two camps: one is the aggressive camp headed by US imperialism, and the other is the peaceful and democratic camp headed by the socialist Soviet Union. Today, China, due to the decisive victory of the revolutionary war, has become the backbone of the peaceful and democratic camp. Just as the warmongers of US imperialism are our mortal enemies, the Soviet people are our closest friends, with whom we share weal and woe. The tangible and intangible support that the Soviet people have given to our revolutionary war is immeasurable.
    The Soviet Union has been established for thirty-two years. The October Revolution eliminated a Russian imperialism. In the Second World War, it also defeated the fascist Axis alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. In this way, the powerful Soviet people's armed forces successively eliminated four powerful imperialist countries. The imperialist camp has been weakened. After the Second World War, a series of people's democratic republics emerged in Eastern Europe. The people in various imperialist countries and the oppressed nations in various colonies have been encouraged, and the angry tide of striving for democratic liberation is surging all over the world. Due to the weakening of aggressive forces and the strengthening of the democratic camp, the warmongers of imperialism, despite their arrogance and despotism, are in fact outwardly strong but inwardly weak, desperately engaging in petty thievery.
    Therefore, the victory of the Chinese people is due to the long-term and unyielding struggle of the Chinese people, the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, but we should also thank the international, especially the tangible and intangible assistance of the Soviet Union.
    However, the imperialists and their lackeys, in order to conceal their ferocity, out of hostile consciousness, have done their best to block, deceive, and distort the truth about the Soviet Union, and even arbitrarily slander and vilify it in order to deceive the people of the world. The Kuomintang reactionaries in China have done this reactionary work meticulously. Therefore, many of our Chinese people are still not very clear about the truth about the Soviet Union. Moreover, a few people still hold deep-rooted misunderstandings. Some people even say that the Soviet Union is a red imperialism and that the Soviet Union is an aggressive totalitarian state, which is truly confusing black and white.
    Our Chinese delegation passed through the Soviet Union on our previous trip abroad, and we witnessed the free and happy lives of the Soviet people, experienced the incomparably profound love and treatment of the Soviet people, and also visited the glorious construction of the Soviet Union in various aspects since the revolution, especially since the war, which made us deeply feel that the Soviet Union is our closest ally and the most perfect example. We must step up our understanding of the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union, break through all the blockades, deceptions, distortions, slanders, and vilifications of the reactionaries, and present the truth about the Soviet Union frankly so that all the Chinese people can jointly understand and learn from it.
    On the evening of May 9, on the eve of our departure from Moscow to return to China, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held a grand farewell party for us. At that time, on behalf of our delegation, I said in response to the host's grand intention: "After we return to China, we must work hard to enhance the friendly relations and cultural exchanges between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. We must organize an institution such as the 'Sino-Soviet Friendship Association' to accomplish this task. The future China is a people's democratic republic under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. If the 'Sino-Soviet Friendship Association' is established, then our membership will certainly not be a number of one million or two million, but a number as large as one hundred million or two hundred million."
    My words won warm applause from the host. The host had indeed extended a warm hand there for us to grasp long ago. At that time, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries sent us many books to bring back to our country. Since we returned to China, nearly two months have passed in a flash. Mr. Qian Junrui, the secretary-general of the delegation, who returned to Beiping one step later than us, has recently returned to Beiping. According to him, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries has prepared two more large batches of books to send to us. Such deep friendship is truly inspiring to us.
    Therefore, today, in the name of the Chinese delegation attending the World Peace Congress, we invite you to jointly initiate the organization of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association," step up the study of the Soviet Union, absorb the valuable experience of the Soviet Union in various aspects such as politics, economy, culture, and national defense since the founding of the country, and expose all the deceptions and slanders of the reactionaries against the Soviet Union, in order to enhance the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. Of course, we should also strive to contribute our experience and wisdom to our friends, so that we can jointly solve the problems of the whole world and even the problems of nature.
    We know that during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, there was an organization called the "Sino-Soviet Cultural Association." During a certain period, under the operation of some progressive people, that organization also played some progressive roles. The old "Sino-Soviet Cultural Association" originally intended to use the name "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association" when it was established, but because the reactionaries were not happy about Sino-Soviet friendship, they chose the name "Cultural Association." This shows that the "Cultural Association" had unfriendly elements from the beginning. Moreover, that association was headed by top war criminal Sun Ke as the president, and two of the three vice-presidents, Chen Lifu and He Yingqin, were also top war criminals. We cannot inherit such a "glorious" tradition.
    We also know that four years ago, on August 15th, after the Soviet Red Army helped us defeat Japanese imperialism and liberate the Northeast, Sino-Soviet friendship associations were initiated in Harbin and Dalian. However, the work was not fully developed, and it was only a local organization. Once the national institution we are initiating today is established, the associations in Harbin and Dalian can exist as branches.
    In short, the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union should be fully developed today, and not limited to cultural people. The exchange of experience between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union should also be fully developed today, and not limited to culture. This work is inseparable from the founding of New China. This work is also inseparable from the cause of upholding world peace. We sincerely hope that, with the joint efforts of the friends present today, the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association" will be established as soon as possible, and that our membership will truly reach a number as large as 475 million people.
    Long live the eternal friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live the victory of the world peace and democracy camp!
    Long live patriotic internationalism!

### 中苏友好协会发起人大会上  郭沫若开幕词

    中苏友好协会发起人大会上
    郭沫若开幕词
    【平市讯】郭沫若在中苏友好协会发起人大会上的开幕词，全文如下：
    今天我们出席世界拥护和平大会中国代表团作为初步发起人，邀请各位先生来参加中苏友好协会发起人大会，承蒙各位先生踊跃地出席，使我们非常兴奋。
    我们中国代表团回国以来已经快两个月了，有两件还未完成的任务，在等待着筹备的成熟。第一件是世界拥护和平分会的设立，第二件便是今天所要发起的中苏友好协会的组织。
    全世界很鲜明地划分为了两个阵营，一边是以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营，另一边是以社会主义国家的苏联为首的和平民主阵营。我们中国在今天，由于革命战争的决定性的胜利，已经成为了和平民主阵营的中坚。就跟美帝国主义的战争贩子们是我们的死对头一样，苏联人民是我们休戚相关的最亲密的朋友。苏联人民对于我们的革命战争所给予的有形无形的支援，那是不可计量的。
    苏联建国已经三十二年了。十月革命消灭了一个俄罗斯帝国主义。在二次大战中，又击溃了法西斯轴心联盟德意日三国。就这样，由于强大的苏联人民武力先后消灭了四个强大的帝国主义国家。帝国主义的阵营是被削弱了。而在二次大战后，在东欧更出现了一系列的人民民主共和国。各帝国主义国家内的人民，各殖民地的被压迫民族，都得到了鼓励，争取民主解放的怒潮正在全世界中奔腾澎湃。由于侵略势力的削弱，由于民主阵营的增强，帝国主义的战争贩子们尽管嚣张跋扈，而在事实上是色厉而内荏，拼命在干些鼠窃狗偷的勾当了。
    因此，我们中国人民的胜利，固然由于我们中国人民长期奋斗的不屈不挠，由于中国共产党和毛主席领导的正确，由于人民解放军作战的英勇，但同时也应该感谢国际的，特别是苏联的有形无形的援助。
    但是帝国主义者及其走狗们，他们为了掩盖自己的凶恶，出于敌对意识，对于苏联的真相却尽力地封锁、蒙蔽、歪曲，更进而任意加以诬蔑、诽谤，以欺骗全世界的人民。我们中国的国民党反动派，对这种反动工作是做得无微不至的。因此，我们中国人民中也就有不少的人对于苏联的真相依然不十分明了。而且还有少数的人更抱着深固的误解。甚至有人说苏联是赤色帝国主义，苏联是侵略极权国家，那真是看朱成碧，倒白为黑了。
    我们中国代表团前次出国，来回都经过苏联，眼见了苏联人民的自由幸福的生活，身受了苏联人民的无比深切的友爱待遇，也参观了苏联的革命以来特别是大战以来各方面的辉煌建设，使我们深切地感觉着苏联是我们最亲密的盟邦，而且是最完善的榜样。我们须得加紧认识苏联，学习苏联，打破一切反动派的封锁、蒙蔽、歪曲、诬蔑、诽谤，把苏联的真相坦白地呈现出来，让全中国的人民来共同认识，共同学习。
    五月九日的晚上，我们要离开莫斯科回国的前夜，苏联对外文化协会曾经替我们举行了一次盛大的欢送会。那时我代表本团在答复主人的盛意上，曾经说过这样的话：“我们回国以后，一定要努力增进中苏两大民族的友好关系和文化交流。我们一定要组织一个‘中苏友好协会’这样的机构来完成这项任务。今后的中国是在毛泽东主席领导之下的人民民主共和国了。假使‘中苏友好协会’一旦成立，那我们的会员断不会是一百万两百万的数目，而会是一万万两万万那样大的数目了”。
    我说了这样的话，博得了主人方面一片热烈的掌声。主人方面的确是早就把温暖的手伸在那儿让我们去把握的。当时对外文化协会曾经送了我们很多的书籍，让我们带回了国来。我们回国以来，转瞬已快要两个月了。比我们后回国一步的代表团的秘书长钱俊瑞先生最近也回到了北平。据他告诉我们，苏联对外文化协会又准备好了两大批书籍要给我们送来了。这样深切的情谊，实在是使我们感奋。
    因此，我们今天以出席世界拥护和平大会中国代表团的名义，邀请各位来共同发起“中苏友好协会”的组织，加紧进行对于苏联的学习，吸收苏联建国以来的政治、经济、文化、国防等各方面的宝贵经验，并揭破一切反动派对苏联的蒙蔽与诬蔑，以增进中苏两大民族的友谊。当然我们也应该努力，把我们的经验和智慧贡献给我们的朋友，我们好共同来解决全世界的问题乃至自然界的问题。
    我们知道，在国民党反动派统治时期曾经有过“中苏文化协会”的组织，那个组织在某一段时期，在某些进步人士的运用之下也曾起过一些进步的作用。那个旧时的“中苏文化协会”在成立的当时本来也打算用“中苏友好协会”的名义的，但因为反动派不高兴中苏友好，因此才选用了“文化协会”的名目。这可见那个“文化协会”一开始便有不友好的成分存在。而且那个协会是以头等战犯孙科为会长，三个副会长之中的两个陈立夫、何应钦，也是头等战犯。这样“光荣”的传统，我们是无法继承的。
    我们也知道，在四年前的八一五，苏联红军帮助我们击溃了日本帝国主义，解放了东北之后，哈尔滨和大连等地已先后有中苏友好协会的发起。但是工作并没有十分展开，只是一种地方性的机构。我们今天所发起的这个全国性的机构一旦成立，哈尔滨和大连等地的协会是可以作为分会而存在的。
    总之，中苏两大民族的友谊，今天是应该全面地展开，不能仅限于文化人了。中苏两大民族的经验交流，今天也是应该全面地展开，不能仅限于文化了。这项工作和新中国的建国事业是分不开来的。这项工作和拥护世界和平的事业也是分不开来的。我们恳切地希望，靠着今天到会的朋友们的共同努力，使“中苏友好协会”早日成立，并使我们的会员真的要办到四万万七千五百万人那样大的数目。
    中苏两大民族的永恒友谊万岁！
    世界和平民主阵营胜利万岁！
    爱国的国际主义胜利万岁！
