　　The Struggle Against Nationalism within the Bulgarian Communist Party (Continued)
　　Fyodor Kolarov, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party

　　The source of Traicho Kostov's nationalistic errors stems from his past history as a leftist and the eternally unfillable gap of his self-serving intellectual reputation. This kind of personal selfishness has nothing in common with Bolshevism.

　　Traicho Kostov's relationship with the Central Political Bureau and with Comrade Dimitrov was duplicitous and two-faced. On the one hand, he used the prestige of the Central Political Bureau and Dimitrov to ensure the effective implementation of his instructions; on the other hand, he increasingly despised the Central Committee, attempting to strengthen his personal position by this means, and thus become the actual "leader" of the party. His actions were the same as the methods adopted by the leftists after the Leipzig trial. They also verbally acknowledged Dimitrov's leadership, but in fact, they plotted to seize the party's leadership.

　　At the time of the Leipzig trial, Traicho Kostov belonged to a group of leftists who had temporarily gained the upper hand in the party's leadership. At that time, the working class of the whole world, and the progressives of all countries, were inspired by Comrade Dimitrov, and tried their best to support him, spiritually, to rescue Comrade Dimitrov from the hands of the fascist executioners. Only from the Bulgarian leftists did he not get any support. Traicho Kostov at that time supported the leadership of the leftists. Until the collapse of the leftist Trotskyist line in May 1934, Traicho Kostov still insisted on this wrong line in the party's publications. It is not possible now to remain silent about this period of Kostov's history. When linked to his serious political errors, the question will inevitably arise: What kind of person is Traicho Kostov after all?

　　After Traicho Kostov's actions were revealed, he began to attempt to get away with a formal "self-criticism" of his errors. Then he admitted that the facts were indeed anti-Soviet behavior, admitting his muddleheadedness, remnants of intellectual individualism, and so on.

　　But then he seemed to come to the conclusion that his "self-criticism" was excessive. In his letter to the Political Bureau, he turned to a comprehensive attack against the party's leadership. But when he learned that his letter had aroused unanimous opposition from the whole party, Kostov declared at the Political Bureau meeting on March 7 this year that he would withdraw the original letter, expressing his apology, saying that he wrote such a letter because of "a sudden surge of anger and post-illness nervous disorder."

　　After Kostov slandered the entire party and its leadership, he tried to show that he was making further "self-criticism." But he finally failed to do so, because he lacked the most practical condition for self-criticism—loyalty to the party.

　　At the Central Plenary Session, Kostov changed his tactics again. He attended the meeting like a factionalist within the party. He made all preparations to clear himself. He skillfully avoided his own mistakes and shifted the responsibility to others. He even harbored adventurous attempts to slander the Political Bureau, attempting to split the Central Plenary Session, and even attempting to sow seeds of distrust between the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

　　But Kostov was completely wrong. All his attempts to shake the party's unity and create rifts in the party's leadership failed. The plenary session smashed all the ugly deeds of Traicho Kostov's factionalism, showing the complete and unbreakable unity of the party, with the whole party rallied around the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Dimitrov. This kind of party unity is based on the unwavering belief in the correct Bolshevik policy of the CPSU and Comrade Stalin.

　　Traicho Kostov, until he realized that his attempt at factional activities had completely collapsed, and felt completely isolated, did he decide to unconditionally admit his mistakes and admit that the organization's conclusions about him were correct.

　　But this was just a helpless submission. For the participants of the plenary session, the fact was very clear from the beginning when the question was raised: Kostov could no longer stand in a leading position in the party and government. Because it was precisely in these positions that he had committed serious crimes, and had become a completely failed leader. The plenary session clearly saw that Kostov could not continue to be a member of the Political Bureau either. Because Kostov, in attempting to place himself above the party's leadership and replace the party's leadership, had placed himself outside the Political Bureau. Under the many conditions that have been created, his return to the Political Bureau would be detrimental to the party.

　　Such was the resolution unanimously adopted by the plenary session. At the same time, the Central Plenary Session decided to fully communicate Traicho Kostov's errors to the whole party, and remind the whole party that it must be strictly vigilant and resolutely struggle against all anti-Soviet hostile activities—this most vile manifestation of nationalism.

　　After the Central Plenary Session, party activists and all party grassroots organizations seriously criticized Traicho Kostov's major political errors and the nationalistic tendencies manifested by these errors themselves at various meetings. The party members showed a high degree of awareness, recognizing that nationalism is a weapon of foreign imperialism and domestic class enemies. Domestic and foreign enemies are concentrating all their efforts to try to break the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union, and to create rifts between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, and between Bulgaria and other new democratic countries. And this is the most practical and effective means of dealing a blow to Bulgaria's independence and leading it into the imperialist camp.

　　Comrade Dimitrov's assessment—whether Traicho wants it or not, he will become the banner of all reactionary, restorationist plotters—has been fully confirmed. The reactionaries have praised Kostov as a national hero, and have asked their comrades to unite around Kostov to fight against the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Fatherland Front, and to split the relationship between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria and all the anti-imperialist camp.

　　The unwavering unity and consolidation of the entire party around the party's basic line, around the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee headed by Dimitrov, is the most effective answer to the slander campaign of our party's and people's enemies in coordination with the Kostov incident.

　　The relentless opposition to all manifestations of nationalism and factional activities will further strengthen the ideological and organizational unity of the Bulgarian Communist Party's ranks.

### 保加利亚共产党内的反对民族主义的斗争（续完）

　　保加利亚共产党内的反对民族主义的斗争（续完）
    保加利亚共产党中央政治局委员  弗·科拉罗夫
    特莱乔·科斯托夫的民族主义的错误产生的来源是他过去左派的历史及其自私自利的知识分子名誉地位的永远不能填平的壑。这种个人私欲与布尔什维主义是毫无共同之点的。
    特莱乔·科斯托夫对中央政治局以及对季米特洛夫同志的关系是两重性的，是两面派的态度。一方面他为了使自己的指令有效施行，利用中央政治局和季米特洛夫的威信；而另外一方面，他却越来越甚地轻视中央，试图以这种手段加强自己的个人地位，进而为党的实际的“领袖”。他的行动和左派分子在莱比锡审判案后所采取的方法一样，他们也曾在口头上承认过季米特洛夫的领导地位，但在事实上他们却图谋攫取党的领导权。
    莱比锡审判案当时，特莱乔·科斯托夫是属于暂时取得了党的上层领导的左派分子的一员。当时全世界的工人阶级，各国的进步人士都为季米特洛夫同志所感召，极力以他们的精神支援从法西斯刽子手中夺回季米特洛夫同志。只是从保加利亚的左派分子那里他没有得到任何的支持。特莱乔·科斯托夫当时是拥护左派分子的领导的。一直到一九三四年五月左派托洛斯基派路线垮台为止，特莱乔·科斯托夫还在党的出版物上坚持着这一错误路线。现在是不能对科斯托夫的这一段历史缄默不言的。当联系到他的严重的政治错误的时候，不期然而然会提出疑问：特莱乔·科斯托夫究竟是一个什么人？
    当特莱乔·科斯托夫的行为被揭露以后，他开始企图以对自己错误的形式的“自我批评”搪脱了事。接着他又承认了事实的确是反苏行为，承认自己的昏愦无知，知识分子个人主义的残余等等。
    但接着大约他又做出一种结论认为自己的“自我批评”是过火了。即在其给政治局的信里转向全面的进攻，反对党的领导。但当得知他的信引起了全党一致地反对以后的科斯托夫在本年三月七日的政治局会议上却又声明收回原信，表示歉意说“一时怒火上升加以病后神经错乱”才写出了这样一封信。
    当科斯托夫诬蔑了整个党及其领导以后，他试图表明自己在作进一步的“自我批评”。但他终于未能做到这一点，因为他缺少一个自我批评最实际的条件——对党的忠实。
    在中央全会上科斯托夫重新又改变了策略。他如同一个党内的派系分子一样出席会议。为洗清自己做好了一切准备工作。他巧妙地避开了自己的错误，将责任推到别人头上。他竟怀有冒险的企图，诽谤政治局，妄图分裂中央全会而且甚至妄图在保共与联共之间种下互不信任的种子。
    但科斯托夫是彻头彻尾地失算了。他的一切动摇党的团结，在党的领导中间制造裂痕的企图都落空了。全会击破了特莱乔·科斯托夫一切派系分子的丑行，表现了完全的与不可破裂的党的团结，全党围绕在以季米特洛夫同志为首的党中央。这种党的团结乃是建立在不可动摇的信任联共党和斯大林同志的正确的布尔什维克的政策的基础上的。
    特莱乔·科斯托夫直至察觉到自己的派系活动的企图完全垮台，感到自己是完全孤立的时候，他才决定了无条件地承认自己的错误，承认了组织对他做的结论是正确的。
    但这只不过是无可奈何的服从而已。对于全会的参加者来说，当一开始提出问题就很清楚这一事实了：即科斯托夫不能再在党内与政府内站在领导岗位了。因为他正是在这些岗位上犯下了严重的罪行，并已成了一个一败涂地的领导者了。全会明明白白地看到了科斯托夫也不能继续做政治局的委员了。因为企图将自己摆在党的领导之上并代替党的领导，科斯托夫已将自己置于政治局之外了。在已经造成的诸多条件下，他回到政治局来，是会给党带来损害的。
    全会全体赞成一致通过的决议就是这样的。同时中央全会决定将特莱乔·科斯托夫的错误向全党全部传达，并提醒全党关于必须严格警惕与坚决斗争，反对一切反苏的敌对活动——这一最恶劣的民族主义倾向的表现形式。
    党的活动分子与一切党的基层组织在中央全会后，在各种会议上严肃批评了特莱乔·科斯托夫的重大的政治错误和这些错误本身所表现出来的民族主义的倾向。党员们表现了高度的觉悟性，他们认定民族主义是外国帝国主义与国内阶级敌人的武器。国内外敌人集中一切力量力图击破以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义的阵营，在保加利亚与苏联之间，在保加利亚与其他新民主国家之间制造裂痕。而这乃是给保加利亚的独立以打击并引其到帝国主义阵营去的最实际最易奏效的手段。
    季米特洛夫同志所作的估计——不管特莱乔愿不愿意，他会变成一切反动的，阴谋复辟分子的旗帜已经完全证实了。反动派已赞扬科斯托夫为民族英雄，并且请自己的同道团结在科斯托夫的周围为反对保国共产党与祖国阵线，为分裂苏联与保加利亚与一切反帝阵营的关系而斗争。
    围绕在党的基本路线，围绕在以季米特洛夫为首的保共中央的全党的不可动摇的团结与巩固，乃是对于我们党与人民的敌人在其诽谤运动中配合科斯托夫事件的最有效的回答。
    无情的反对一切民族主义的表现和派系活动定将更进一步地加强保加利亚共产党的队伍的思想上与组织上的团结一致。
