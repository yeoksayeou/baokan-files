　　Tianjin Organizes Flood Prevention Army
  　Mayor Huang Jing Inspects Rivers in the Rain

    [Special Dispatch from our Tianjin Correspondent] Affected by the typhoon, Tianjin has experienced continuous rain in recent days, causing a slight increase in the water levels of various rivers. The Hai River has exceeded the warning level. Under the unified leadership of the Flood Prevention Committee, some citizens have organized to fight against potential floods to ensure the safety of Tianjin. According to incomplete statistics, as of the 29th, more than 60,000 people have joined the emergency rescue teams, and nearly 190,000 people have joined the emergency reserve teams. Various emergency rescue materials are being actively registered. More than 780,000 sacks and straw bags have been registered. The seven flood prevention districts in the city are inspecting the dikes and urgently repairing dangerous works. Most projects have taken measures to protect machinery and property. The Flood Prevention Committee has raised the Xinkai River sluice gate to discharge floodwaters from the Bei Canal and Ziya River. Gaps and crossings on the riverbanks below 5.5 meters have been blocked, and pumps are being installed to promptly block any backflow from underground passages. In addition, considering that the accumulation of sand in the Bei Canal flowing into the Hai River has increased, the committee has agreed with the Tianjin County Government to open the sluice gate in the Qujiadian silt discharge area of ​​the Bei Canal if necessary to reduce the danger to the Tianjin urban area.

    [Further News] Yesterday at 12:30 PM, Huang Jing, the chief commander of flood prevention in the city, along with deputy commanders Xu Jianguo, Zhang Huakan, and Yang Zhenya, set off in the rain to inspect the dikes along the Hai River, Bei Canal, Nan Canal to Ziya and Xihe Bridge, deploying intensified flood prevention and preparing for various rescue tasks.

    [Urgent Telegram from Tong County, 30th, 18:00] Tong County has been raining since 11:00 on the 29th. By 17:00 on the 30th, 109 millimeters of rain had fallen, and it had not stopped by the time this telegram was sent. The water in the Bei Canal is rising rapidly, having risen three feet higher than yesterday and is still rising. (Water Conservancy Commission Communication Group)
