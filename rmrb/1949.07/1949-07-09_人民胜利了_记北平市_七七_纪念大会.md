The People Have Won
    ——A Record of the "July 7th" Commemoration Rally in Beiping
    Jin Yu
    "Unite under the banner of Mao Zedong and build a new China!" This is the most striking slogan of the "July 7th" Commemoration Rally, and also a new battle cry. These 200,000 people, from battlefields, factories, workshops, government offices, schools, and shops, possess diverse and rich fighting experience, or fighting enthusiasm, and they will resolutely realize this call.
    The red walls and yellow tiles of the former imperial palace, Tiananmen, are now even more solemn: the red flags and large red palace lanterns fluttering gently in the drizzle radiate a red glow. Countless electric lights illuminate the giant portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, reflecting a dazzling brilliance in the sky. In the drizzling night, 200,000 people gathered into a sea of people before their leaders, from Tiananmen to Zhonghua Gate, from Dongsan zuo men to Xisan zuo men, from the square to the Yuhe Bridge. The intense light of the mercury lamps crossed and illuminated the countless crowds from time to time, and the cameras captured this grand scene one by one. Everyone participating in this victory celebration smiled, proud of their happiness.
    Amid the sound of huge salutes, "The March of the Volunteers" was played on the rostrum, and everyone excitedly and tensely recalled the struggles of the past twelve years. The people of Beiping began to support the War of Resistance Against Japan after the first shot was fired at Lugou Bridge. However, the Kuomintang army betrayed the people and fled south. The people of Beiping were abandoned, thrown into a dark hell. Some, as the "March of the Volunteers" says, "advanced in the face of the enemy's gunfire," fighting bloody battles with the enemy on the battlefield, but most stayed in their homes—Beiping—fighting hunger, persecution, and death. Young people became youths, and youths became middle-aged... Finally, today, they see victory, celebrate victory. Everyone's mood is tense, excited, and indescribable. Some eyes are wet, some shout "Chairman Mao" with emotion, some smile. This was something they never thought of, but also something everyone had long thought about: "We must win!" Now, millions of eyes are focused on the radiant portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu under the lights. When Chairman Mao entered the venue, 200,000 people stood up to welcome this brilliant leader, cheering like electric shocks: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" The song "The East is Red" was also sung! Chairman Mao walked to the front of the stage, leading everyone in shouting: "People of the whole country, unite and build a new China!" The loud slogans drowned out everything. This is a battle cry. Based on their past personal experience, people know that it will surely be realized. The banner presented to Chairman Mao at the conference also read: "We pledge to you with infinite loyalty that under your wise leadership, we will build and consolidate a new China with the people's democratic dictatorship, and rapidly restore and develop Beiping's economy, and develop cultural construction!"
    The rain is getting heavier and heavier. But the people who have experienced all kinds of storms stand still, the singing is getting louder and louder, and the slogans are also getting louder and louder.
    After Chairman Mao gave a brief and powerful instruction, he began the review. 200,000 people came forward, cheering and welcoming. When Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai walked to the front of the stage, thunderous applause immediately erupted from below, lasting for a long time. "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese people!" The cheers continued for a long time.

　　人民胜利了
    ——记北平市“七七”纪念大会
    靳玉
    “在毛泽东旗帜下团结起来，建设新中国!”这是“七七”纪念大会一个最鲜明的标语，也是一个新的战斗号召。这二十万人，来自战场、工厂、作坊、机关、学校、商店，具备着各色各样的丰富的斗争经验，或斗争热诚，他们将坚决实现这个号召。
    原来帝王之家的红墙黄瓦的天安门，现在更加庄严：在细雨中微微飘动的红旗及大红宫灯，放射着红色的光芒。无数电灯照耀着毛泽东主席、朱德总司令的巨像。在天空映成一片夺目的光彩，二十万人在自己的领袖之前，在细雨夜色中汇成一片人海。从天安门到中华门、从东三座门到西三座门，从广场到御河桥上。水银灯的强烈的光芒时时交叉照射着无数的人群，开麦拉把这宏大的场面一一摄入了镜头。每一个参与这次胜利大典的人，微笑着，为自己的幸福而骄傲。
    巨大的礼炮声中，主席台上奏起了义勇军进行曲，每个人都激动地紧张地回忆起十二年来的斗争，北平的人们，在芦沟桥响起第一炮后，就开始了支援抗日战争的工作。但是国民党的军队背弃了人民，向南逃跑了。北平的人民从此被抛下了，被抛进了黑暗的地狱，有的象义勇军进行曲中说的“冒着敌人的炮火前进”，在战场上与敌人浴血战斗着，但大部曾守在自己的家园——北平，与饥饿、迫害、死亡斗争，少年变成了青年，青年变成了中年，……终于在今天看见胜利了，欢呼胜利了，每个人的心情，是紧张的，兴奋的，难以说出来的，有的眼睛润湿了，有的感动的喊着“毛主席”，有的笑着，这是从没有想到的，但也是每个人早已想过了的：“我们要胜利呀”，现在千万只眼睛都注视着灯光下神彩焕发的毛主席和朱总司令的巨像。毛主席进入会场时，二十万人站起来，迎接这位英明的领导者，电动似的欢呼着：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“东方红”的歌声也唱起来了！毛主席走向台前，领导着全体高呼：“全国人民团结起来建设新中国！”宏亮的口号声，掩盖了一切，这是一个战斗号召。人们根据过去的切身经验，知道一定会胜利实现的。大会献给毛主席的锦旗上，也这样地写着：“我们以无限忠诚向你保证，在你英明的领导下，建设和巩固人民民主专政的新中国，迅速恢复和发展北平的经济，并发展文化建设事业！”
    雨越下越大了。但经过了各种各样暴风雨的人们屹立不动，歌声越来越响，口号也越来越响。
    毛主席在作了简短有力的指示后，开始检阅。二十万人走前来欢呼着，迎接着。毛主席、朱总司令、周恩来副主席走至台前时，台下立刻暴发了海涛一般的掌声，历久不息；“毛主席万岁！”“中国人民万岁！”欢呼声经久不息。
