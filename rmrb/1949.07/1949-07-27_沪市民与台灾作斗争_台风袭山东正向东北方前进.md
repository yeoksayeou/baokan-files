Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th: A typhoon that crossed the Ryukyu Islands, bringing storms and rain, struck Shanghai on the morning of the 24th. Seawater poured back into Wusongkou. Throughout the city of Shanghai and the surrounding area within twenty to thirty li, all streets, large and small, were one to six chi deep in water. The most severely affected areas were Zhabei, Hongkou, and Yangshupu along the Suzhou Creek, with approximately 100,000 to 200,000 refugees fleeing into the city center. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government immediately organized a refugee relief committee and mobilized all government agencies and people's organizations to carry out emergency relief work. Shanghai workers bravely rescued machinery and fought against the typhoon disaster. Workers at the electricity company worked day and night, braving the storms to repair telephone lines and prevent the dangers of electric shock and leakage.

Tianjin Telegram: According to a telegram from the Qingdao Observatory at 11:00 AM on the 26th, the typhoon that struck Shandong is now moving in a northeast direction, and its strength remains high. Shandong Peninsula is experiencing widespread wind and rain. It is expected that the typhoon's impact will also extend to the Bohai Bay and the Jiaodong Peninsula. The sea conditions in that area are dangerous, with rising tides along the coast, and strict precautions are needed.

　　沪市民与台灾作斗争
  　台风袭山东正向东北方前进
    【新华社上海二十六日电】越过琉岛的台风，带着暴风雨，在二十四日上午进袭上海市。吴淞口外海水倒灌。上海市周围二三十里地区内，除了个别较高的地区以外，全市大小街道水深一尺到六尺，灾情最严重的是苏州河北闸北、虹口、杨树浦一带，约有一二十万难民逃入市中心区。上海市人民政府立即组织了难民救济委员会，并动员各机关和各人民团体进行紧急的救济工作。上海市职工奋勇抢救机器，和台风灾害作斗争。电力公司工人不分日夜冒着暴风雨抢修电话，防止触电和走电的危险。
    【天津电】据青岛观象台二十六日上午十一时来电称：进袭山东的台风现向东北方向前进，势力仍强，山东半岛普遍风雨，预计台风的势力亦将普及渤海湾及胶东半岛，该区的海上风浪险恶，沿岸潮水上涨，需严加防患。
