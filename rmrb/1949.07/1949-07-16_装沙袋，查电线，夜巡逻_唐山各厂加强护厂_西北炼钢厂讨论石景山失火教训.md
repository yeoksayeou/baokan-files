	Tangshan Factories Strengthen Plant Protection
	Northwest Steel Plant Discusses Lessons from Fire at Shijingshan

[Tangshan Electric Dispatch] All state-owned and private factories in Tangshan City are strengthening plant protection work and have implemented various necessary measures. Qixin Cement Company, a private enterprise with over forty years of history, had never paid serious attention to fire and theft prevention. Now, after studying the report on the fire accident in the laboratory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beiping, the factory's labor union committee, employee representatives, deputy factory directors, and heads of various production departments have conducted discussions and research focusing on the factory's situation. They unanimously agreed that it is necessary to mobilize all factory employees to consciously protect the factory. It was decided to print the news about the fire at the Shijingshan Steel Plant into a bulletin, distribute one copy to each employee, and have the employee union and heads of various departments relay and discuss it in groups, formulate labor discipline for each department, and establish a leave system for entering and leaving the factory. In addition, the fire brigade will strengthen training, add fire-fighting equipment, and carefully inspect electrical wires to prevent leakage. All employees of the Tangshan branch of the North China Electric Power Company's power plant and the public security team stationed at the plant jointly formed a fire prevention committee, installed two water pumps, and workers voluntarily used their spare time to transport sand and fill fire-extinguishing bags. The workers on duty every night cooperate with the public security personnel to patrol, and one person from each section of the staff is assigned to take turns on duty, with a weekly reporting and inspection system stipulated. Workers at the De× Porcelain Factory have formally established a fire brigade of 168 people, responsible for fire prevention patrols, guarding, storage, and rescue duties. Actions have already begun.

[Taiyuan Electric Dispatch] All takeover personnel and employees of the Taiyuan Northwest Steel Plant earnestly studied and discussed "The Causes and Handling of the Fire at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant." After the newspaper carrying the news arrived at the steel plant, Comrade Zhang Peijiang, the military representative, immediately gathered all takeover personnel to organize the study. During the study, they linked it to the specific situation of the plant, earnestly studied effective measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring, and reviewed the insufficient attention paid to plant protection work since liberation, especially the explosion of the coal tar heat exchanger in the coking section on June 2nd. This incident was mainly due to insufficient leadership inspection, resulting in significant losses and preventing the completion of asphalt tasks in June. Currently, the fire prevention equipment in each department and workshop has been thoroughly inspected, and the organization of the fire brigade has been established. The workers' guard team has also been reorganized, with Comrade Guo Qiying, the deputy military representative, personally serving as the captain, and Comrade Liu Yunshan, the branch secretary, serving as the instructor. To prevent accidents, the entire factory uniformly uses the north gate for entry and exit, and all previously issued temporary passes have been recalled. If the workers' guard team discovers strangers in the workplace, they will immediately report it. The power grid is electrified at night. The military representative and deputy military representative take turns on duty every night, and the liaison officers of each section also work with the duty section chiefs every night. Mobile sentry posts are set up at important locations such as warehouses, important machinery, and easily flammable areas at night. A factory-wide plant protection movement has now been created.

    唐山各厂加强护厂
    西北炼钢厂讨论石景山失火教训
    【唐山电】唐山市各公私营工厂加强护厂工作，进行了各种必要的设施。私营启新洋灰公司创设四十来年，对防火、防盗均未切实注意过。现该厂工委会及职工代表，正副厂长，各生产部门负责人员在学习了北平石景山钢铁厂化验室失火事件的报导后，针对本厂情形进行了讨论研究，一致认为必须发动全厂职工自觉地防护工厂，决定把有关石景山制钢厂失火事件的消息印成文告，发给职工每人一份，由职工会及各部主管人员分组传达讨论，制订各部门的劳动纪律，及出入工厂的请假制度。另外，加强消防队的训练，添设防火器材，认真检查电线，防止漏电。华北电业唐山分公司发电所全体职工与驻该所的公安队联合组成防火委员会，装设了两部抽水机，工友们自动利用工余时间，运来沙子，装成消火袋。每夜值班的工友与公安队员配合巡逻，职员中于每一科室中，均派有一人轮流值班，并规定周末汇报检查制度。德×磁厂职工正式成立了防火队，共一百六十八人，分别负责防火巡逻站岗、保管、救护责任。现已行动起来。
    【太原电】太原西北炼钢厂全体接管人员与全厂职工认真学习讨论“石景山钢铁厂失火事件原因及处理经过”。当刊载该项消息的报纸到达炼钢厂以后，军事代表张培江同志马上召集全体接管人员组织学习。学习中联系本厂具体情况，认真研究防止类似事件发生之有效措施，并检讨解放以来对护厂工作的不够重视，特别是炼焦课关于六月二日煤焦油热交换器的爆炸事件。按该事件主要是领导上检查不够，造成很大的损失，使六月份沥青没有完成任务。现各部门、各工作车间之防火设备都作了严密检查，同时建立了消防队的组织。工人纠察队也重新整顿，由副军事代表郭奇应同志亲自担任队长，支部书记刘云山同志担任指导员。为了防止意外，全厂统一出入北门，从前所发之临时通行证一律收回。工人纠察队如果在工作场所发现生人立即报告，夜间电网通电，军事代表与副军事代表每日夜间轮流值班，各课联络员每日夜间也协同各课值班课长一同工作，夜间各重要地点如仓库及重要机器和容易燃烧的地方，均设流动岗哨。现已造成全体性的护厂运动。
