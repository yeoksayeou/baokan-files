  　Ningbo Captures Bandits and Special Agents
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 23rd] In the past month or so, the Ningbo Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, with the active assistance of the people, has cracked 25 cases involving Kuomintang bandits and special agents, capturing 103 bandits and special agents, including Hong Zhongcheng, commander of the 15th Corps of the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," and seizing 14 guns. When the Jiangbei Fourth Branch Bureau cracked seven cases, citizens hid Public Security Bureau officers in their homes and helped them investigate the situation. As soon as the bandits and special agents arrived, they immediately reported it. The officers immediately captured the bandits. In one capture, two bandits and special agents jumped into the river to escape, but two citizens immediately jumped into the water and caught them.

  　宁波捕获匪特
    【新华社杭州二十三日电】宁波市人民政府公安局，月余来在人民积极帮助下，共破获国民党匪特案二十五起，捕获匪特“反共救国军”十五总队司令洪仲丞等一百零三人，缴枪十四支。在该市江北四分局破获七案时，市民把公安局警员藏在自己家里，代他们侦察情况，等匪特来了，便马上报告。警员立即将匪徒捕获。在某次捕匪时，有两个匪特跳入河中逃走，当即有两市民下水把他们捉起。
