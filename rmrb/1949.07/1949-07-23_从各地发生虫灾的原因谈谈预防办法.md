　　Discussing Preventive Measures Based on the Causes of Insect Plagues in Various Regions

　　The insect plagues in our region have been largely extinguished thanks to the active leadership of cadres at all levels and the efforts of the broad masses. Summarizing the reports from various counties and insect-catching work groups, the area affected by insect plagues this year is quite extensive. The main reasons are: (1) The war environment of the past years has led to rough management of the land by the masses, such as failure to clear seedlings and weeds or to till the autumn fields in time due to a lack of manpower and livestock; (2) In fruit-growing areas, poor sales and low prices of fruits have reduced the interest of fruit farmers in management. The ideological confusion among some people after the land reform and equal distribution has led to a lack of focus on land management. Moreover, the farmers who received fruit trees lack management experience; (3) In forest areas, the diverse forest composition facilitates the parasitism, oviposition, and spread of insect pests; (4) The lack of snow last winter and the drought this spring are also consistent reasons for the easy occurrence of insect plagues.

    Based on the above situation, our understanding of insect pests should not only focus on technical prevention and control, timely detection, and organized extermination to prevent them from becoming a disaster, but also be seen as a problem of rural economic relations and the ideological state of the masses. Here, we propose the following opinions on the future prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, hoping that comrades in various regions will refer to them for research.

    1.  Extensively and constantly propagate our production policies, pointing out that the direction of rural economic development in the future is to build a prosperous life through production and to become rich through diligence, thereby enhancing the production enthusiasm of the masses and achieving intensive cultivation.

    2.  Help the masses in fruit-growing areas to sell their fruits in various ways and obtain appropriate prices, so as to increase the interest of fruit farmers in managing fruit trees.

    3.  In the plains, clear seedlings and weeds and till the autumn fields in time to keep the ground clean, loosen the soil, and turn over the insect eggs in the autumn fields to freeze them to death, thereby eradicating the insect pests.

    4.  In fruit-growing areas, implement thinning and pruning. Decaying and dead trees are most susceptible to insect pests. Therefore, thin out old trees and plant new ones. Advocate pruning fruit trees to remove diseased branches, allowing air to circulate and promoting lush branches and leaves, so as to increase resistance to insect pests. In addition, scraping bark, whitewashing, and burning fallen leaves are all effective ways to eliminate insect eggs.

    5.  Advocate the protection of beneficial birds, such as cuckoos and western jackdaws, and encourage fruit-growing areas to raise more chickens, which can help people catch pests and increase sideline income.

    6.  In spring, implement chemical control when conditions permit.

    7.  Finally, we have realized that the occurrence of insect plagues is caused by the special historical circumstances of the past few years. Therefore, to prevent and eradicate them, we should start from all aspects discussed above. Do not be satisfied with the current achievements in pest control. Strengthen vigilance against insect pests in order to completely eradicate them and benefit the entire agricultural production.

　　从各地发生虫灾的原因谈谈预防办法
    冀东行署农业处
    我区各地的虫灾，在各级干部积极领导和广大群众的努力下，大体上已经扑灭。综合各县及捕虫工作组的报告，今年虫灾的发生面积颇广，其主要原因不外：（一）多年来的战争环境，群众对土地的经营管理粗放，如因人畜劳力缺乏不能及时清苗锄草，秋收地等；（二）果树区由于果子销路不畅，价格降低，使果农减低经营兴趣，土改、平分后部份群众思想一度混乱，无心经营土地，同时分得果树的农民又缺乏管理经验；（三）林区，林相繁杂。这些都是便子虫子的寄生，产卵和虫害的流行；（四）去冬少雪，今春天旱，又是虫害容易发生一致的原因。
    根据以上情况，我们对虫害的认识，不仅是应该从技术上去进行防治和及时注意发现组织扑打，不便成灾；而在另一方面还应该看做这是农村经济关系问题和群众思想情绪问题。这里我们提出对今后防治病虫害的意见如下，希各地同志们参考研究。
    一、广泛的随时随地宣传我们的生产政策，指出今后农村经济发展的方向是生产发家，勤劳致富，提高群众生产情绪，做到精耕细作。
    二、从多方面帮助果树地区的群众把果子销售出去，并取得适当价格，使果农增加经营果树的兴趣。
    三、平原地，要及时清苗锄草和秋垡地，保持地面的清洁，轻松土壤，秋垡地则可翻虫卵，使之冻死，根除虫患。
    四、果树区要实行间伐及修剪，衰老枯死的树株，最容易虫害潜伏，因此，间伐老树，另植新树，提倡果树修剪去掉病枝，使空气流通，枝盛叶茂，以增加抵抗虫害的力量。另外，刮皮、涂白、烧落叶，都是消灭虫卵最有效的办法。
    五、提倡保护益鸟，如布谷鸟、西嘴鸟等，提倡果树区多养鸡，也可帮助人捕食害虫，并增加副业收入。
    六、春季在条件许可时，要实行药剂防除。
    七、最后，我们对虫害的发生已认识到它是几年来特殊的历史情况造成的，那么我们要预防它，根除它，也就应该从以上所谈的各个方面着手，不要满足于当前的扑虫成绩，加强对虫害的警惕，才能彻底根除虫害有利于整个的农业生产。
