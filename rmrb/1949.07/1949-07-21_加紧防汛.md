Jinan Establishes Flood Prevention Organizations at All Levels

[Jinan Electric] Jinan's riverside special and county districts are intensifying flood prevention work, establishing flood prevention organizations at all levels, and carrying out ideological mobilization and material preparation. The First Administrative Office convened a joint meeting of county and district chiefs, district secretaries, construction section chiefs, and construction assistants on the second of this month, establishing a unified flood prevention leadership organization with segmented responsibilities. The Second Administrative Region established a flood prevention headquarters on the fourth. Deputy Commissioner Li Hengfu personally went to the Enxian and Wucheng sections of the river embankment, working with the county chiefs to inspect the river works section by section, as well as the organization and material preparation of the county, district, and village headquarters and emergency response teams. Qinghe County has mostly prepared the necessary materials, such as sacks, iron wire, kerosene, nails, hemp rope, telephones, bicycles, etc. It has also sent personnel to contact neighboring counties such as Linqing and Wucheng to demarcate embankment sections and divide responsibilities. Nanning County in the Fourth Administrative Region, after establishing county, district, and village flood prevention headquarters, also selected 20 to 30 strong individuals from each village, based on the river course, to form emergency response teams for mobile rescue operations. Currently, the Jinan Administrative Office has ordered all special and county districts, as well as all levels of telephone bureau chiefs and flood prevention headquarters, to set flood prevention call times during the flood season and to prepare telephone communication for flood prevention. The River Affairs Bureau is responsible for purchasing larger materials such as lead wire for emergency embankment closures.

Mayor of Taiyuan Makes Self-Criticism

[Taiyuan Electric] In order to implement the instructions of the North China People's Government on flood prevention work, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government convened a meeting of key cadres from the Agriculture Bureau on the 15th of this month to inspect and deploy flood prevention work throughout the region. In inspecting past flood prevention work, it was unanimously agreed that there had been an error in emphasizing water conservancy and neglecting flood control. As early as the 14th of last month, the Municipal Agriculture Bureau received important instructions from the North China People's Government on flood prevention work. The responsible comrade of the bureau hastily wrote "file for future reference" and filed it away. For nearly a month, no comprehensive communication or deployment of flood prevention work was carried out. It was not until mid-month, when floods broke out successively in various counties, that attention was drawn, but some irreparable losses had already been caused. The mayor made a self-criticism on this matter and made urgent arrangements: 1. The Municipal Government immediately instructed each special office to convene a meeting of county heads or production section chiefs to specifically discuss and deploy flood prevention work; 2. Forty-eight water conservancy cadres were transferred to various special offices to specifically help the masses with flood prevention. It was particularly pointed out that governments and cadres at all levels must deeply study the instructions of the North China People's Government on flood prevention work, and with a high degree of responsibility to the people, specifically lead the masses: on the one hand, to deal with the aftermath of the flood; on the other hand, to start repairing and establishing protective projects. Continue to oppose complacency and a fluke mentality.

[Taiyuan Electric] The counties of the Third Administrative Region are leading the rush to build flood control projects. At the beginning of this month, the region experienced widespread heavy rains, followed by mountain floods, and many fields were flooded. According to preliminary investigations, thousands of acres of autumn seedlings and wheat were flooded in Nanzhuang and Shunwo villages in Yuci alone. Taigu and Jiexiu also had some villages affected by floods. The cause of the flood was mainly the paralysis of leadership thinking, failure to grasp the law of preventing drought in spring and flood in summer, and failure to organize farmers to complete flood control projects at an early stage. Many of those that had been built were also damaged. In order to prevent floods in a timely manner, the counties are now leading the rush to repair dams. Villages along the Fen River north of the Tongpu Road in Jiexiu are generally rushing to repair drainage ditches and village protection dikes; the Chengguan District of Taigu convened a disaster prevention meeting on the 11th, planning to complete the moat dike project in the east of the city in three days; in order to uniformly solve the current task of weeding and flood prevention, Pingyao County called on the elderly and weak women in each village to weed, and all male laborers to repair ditches with all their strength, striving to complete the flood control project before the onset of the dog days.

Jidong Emergency Repair Flood Control

[Tangshan Electric] At the beginning of July, continuous heavy rains fell in the Jidong area, and the water levels of large and small rivers within the territory rose sharply. Due to inadequate prevention in some areas, or because of the selfishness of individual farmers who dug dikes and released silt without authorization, floods were caused. According to current understanding, there are a total of three river breaches, with the breach at Dagu Village causing the most serious damage. According to preliminary investigations, although the Jiyun River rose sharply by five or six feet after the rain, the embankments in each section were not in danger of collapsing. Farmers in Dagu Village, seeing that the muddy water of the head river carrying a large amount of sediment had arrived during the rising water, actually opened the embankment without authorization to release silt (which could fertilize the land), and the opening immediately broke to a width of eighty feet. After hearing the news, the district government immediately led the masses to rush to plug the breach. On the 11th and 12th, personnel from the 15th Special Office and the county head of the county, personnel from the flood prevention headquarters at all levels, etc., also rushed to the breach to vigorously supervise the masses to rush to plug it. However, due to the rapid flow of water, it was difficult to plug it at that time, and the opening has now expanded to twenty feet, with a water depth of one foot and five inches. After timely repairs, the expansion of the flood was prevented, but sixty villages and 160,000 acres of land in the Dazhongzhuang depression have become a swamp. Now, in addition to leading the masses to rescue, the local flood prevention headquarters is also investigating responsibilities and making appropriate handling. The Sanhe County Party Committee also issued an emergency instruction, organizing the masses and militia to protect the dikes and prevent sabotage by spies.

Chahar Flood Control Projects Largely Completed

[Chahar News] Flood control and water conservancy projects in various parts of Chahar Province that were not completed in the spring have been largely completed in the gap between the completion of sowing work in June. The Yanbei Special Office organized three water conservancy inspection teams to inspect, supervise, and guide water conservancy and flood control work in Datong, Lingqiu, and Hunyuan. Much progress has been made in the past month. According to statistics from Guangling and Yingxian alone, 16 unfinished channels have been completed. Hunyuan has completed 16 flood control projects, protecting 7,224 acres of land and 10 villages. Tang County sent two cadres to be stationed in the Tang River Beach Committee to specifically lead the Tang River flood control and silt release work.

The flood season is approaching, and some areas still do not pay enough attention to flood control work, resulting in individual areas suffering from floods. This has aroused the vigilance of the leadership.

　　加紧防汛
    冀南建立各级防汛组织
    【冀南电】冀南沿河各专、县加紧防汛工作，建立各级防汛组织，进行思想动员及物资准备。一专署于本月二日召开各县区长、区书及建设科长，建设助理联席会议，建立了统一的防汛领导组织，分段负责。二专区四日成立了防汛指挥部。副专员李衡甫亲赴恩县、武城段河堤，协同各县长逐段检查河工，及县、区、村指挥部、抢险队的组织与物资准备等工作。清河县现已大部备妥必要物资，如麻袋、铁丝、煤油、钉子、麻绳、电话、脚踏车等。并已派员和临清、武城等交界县取得联系，划清堤段，分工负责。四专区宁南县建立县、区、村防汛指挥部后，并以河道为单位，从各村挑选体力强壮的二十至三十人组成抢险队机动抢险。现冀南行署命令各专、县暨各级电话局长、各级防汛指挥部，在防汛期内设定防汛通话时间，并作好便于防汛的电话联络准备。河务局负责购买铅丝等较大物料，专为险工堵口之用。
    太原市长作自我批评
    【太原电】太原市人民政府，为贯彻华北人民政府关于防汛工作的指示，曾于本月十五日召集农业局各主要干部检查布置全区的防汛工作。在检查已往防汛工作中，一致认为过去有重水利、轻防洪的错误。远在上月十四日，市政府农业局即接到华北人民政府关于防汛工作的重要指示，该局负责同志草率批示“存查”二字，即纳入卷宗，近一月之久，对防汛工作未作全面的传达和布置。待本月中旬，各县水患先后暴发，始引起注意，但已造成某些不可弥补的损失。市长对此特作了自我批评，并作了紧急布置：一、市政府立即指示各专署，召开各县县长或生产科长会议，专门讨论布置防汛工作；二、抽调水利干部四十八人，分赴各专署具体帮助群众防汛。并特别指出：各级政府与干部必须深入研讨华北人民政府关于防汛工作指示，以高度为人民负责的精神，具体领导群众：一面处理水灾善后工作；一面动手防护工程的修立。继续反对麻痹大意苟安心理。
    【太原电】三专区各县正领导赶筑防洪工程。该区本月初普降透雨，随着山洪暴涨，不少田禾受到水害。据初步调查：仅榆次南庄、舜涡等村即被淹秋苗、麦子数千亩，太谷、介休，亦有部分村庄遭到水患。水害原因，主要是领导思想麻痹，未能掌握春防旱夏防洪的规律，及早动手组织农民完成防洪工程。已修筑者，不少又损坏。为及时防洪，各县现正领导赶修堤坝。介休同蒲路北沿汾河村庄普遍赶修退水渠、护村堰等工程；太谷城关区十一日召开防患会议，计划三天内突击完成城东护城河堰工程；平遥县为统一解决目前锄苗防洪工作，争取入伏前完成防洪工程，号召各村老弱妇女锄苗，男全劳力全力修渠。
    冀东紧急抢修防洪
    【唐山电】七月初旬，冀东地区连降霪雨，境内大小河流水位陡涨，部分地区由于防范不严，或因个别农民自私，擅自扒堤放淤，致造成洪患。据目前了解，河流决口的地方共有三处，以大沽村决口损失最严重。据初步调查：蓟运河在雨后虽陡涨五、六尺，但各段堤埝均不致发生危险。大沽村农民在涨水时见挟有多量泥沙的头河浑水已到，竟擅自扒开堤埝放淤（可以肥沃土地），顿时口门破成八丈宽。区政府闻讯后，当即领导群众抢堵，十一、十二日，十五专署人员及该县县长、各级防汛指挥部人员等，亦赶到决口处，大力督率群众抢堵。但因水流湍急，一时已难堵塞，现口门已扩大至二十丈，水深一丈五尺，经及时抢修，防止了水患扩大，但大钟庄洼六十个村庄、十六万亩土地，已成泽国。现当地防汛指挥部除领导群众抢救外，并追究责任，作适当的处理。三河县委亦发出紧急指示，组织群众民兵武装护堤，防止奸特分子的破坏。
    察哈尔防洪工程大体完成
    【察哈尔讯】察省各地春季未完成的防洪和水利工程，已在六月份播种工作完成的空隙中大体修筑完成。雁北专署曾组织了三个水利检查组，分赴大同、灵邱、浑源检查和帮助督导水利和防洪工作。一月来得到不少成绩。仅据广灵、应县统计，即完成未竣工的渠道十六道。浑源完成防洪工程十六处，护地七千二百二十四亩，护村十个。唐县派了两个干部长驻唐河滩委会专门领导唐河防洪放淤工作。
    目前伏汛期将到，有些地区对防洪工作仍不够重视，以致个别地区遭受洪患。已引起领导上的警惕。
