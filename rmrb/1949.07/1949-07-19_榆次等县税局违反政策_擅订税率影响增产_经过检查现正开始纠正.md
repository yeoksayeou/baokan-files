[Taiyuan Electric Dispatch] The Third Special District of the Taiyuan area experiences serious lack of organization and discipline in tax work in various counties. According to inspections at the recent urban work conference in the district, tax collection work has seen achievements in the past year, but on the other hand, disorder is also very serious, manifested in: (1) Making decisions independently and modifying tax rates. In Yuci, some transaction taxes were collected repeatedly, and some were collected even when not stipulated. The second tax office of Jiexiu’s slaughter tax arbitrarily set a tax rate of 10% (the regulation is 5%). A certain tax office, upon seeing cloth stalls in the Hongshan Town market, immediately collected transaction taxes, without even asking if a transaction had taken place. (2) Tax collection is uneven, with some lacking fixed standards. When assessing income tax in Qi County from April to June, Fan Shengzhi, a small vendor with only 300,000 yuan in capital, was rated at six points, while Yang Shulin, who owned 3 million yuan in capital, was rated at only four points. In Taiyuan, there is no standard for taxing theaters, and tax officials do not buy tickets and watch plays casually. (3) Impure work style. In Taiyuan, when a certain transaction clerk collected taxes from Hongji Grain Store, no tax receipt was issued. Some counties believe that tax rules are secret, fearing tax evasion, and dare not publicize them, resorting only to simple punishment methods. In addition, there are also individual tax officials who embezzle funds. In the past two months, various counties have carried out rectification, but without significant progress. The reason for the above situation is mainly that the policy thinking of tax cadres is not correct, with a simple task-completion viewpoint, failing to understand the role of taxation in developing production. After these problems were discovered, correction has begun.

    榆次等县税局违反政策
    擅订税率影响增产
    经过检查现正开始纠正
    【太原电】太原区三专区各县税务工作上存在严重的无组织无纪律现象。据该区最近召开的城市工作会议检查，一年来税收工作是有成绩；但另一方面混乱也是十分严重的，表现在：（一）自作决定，修改税率；榆次征收交易税上，有的重复，有的没规定亦征收。介休税务第二所屠宰税，自定依百分之十的税率征收（按规定为百分之五）。某税务所在洪山镇集市见到货摊上有布，即征交易税，亦不问是否成交。（二）税收上畸重畸轻，有的没有一定标准。祁县四至六月所得税评分时，将仅有资金三十万之小贩范生芝订为六分，而拥有三百万元资本的杨树林，仅订为四分。太谷对戏院征税没标准，税务人员则不买票，随便看戏。（三）作风不纯，太谷某交易员征收宏记粮店税时，不开税票，有的县认为税则是秘密的，惟恐逃税，不敢宣传，只好用单纯处罚的办法。此外，个别税务人员从中贪污的亦有。近两月来，各县均有整顿，但亦无显著进展。存在以上情况的原因，主要是税收干部政策思想不够端正，存在有单纯完成任务观点，不了解税收对发展生产的作用。这些问题经发现后，已在开始纠正。
