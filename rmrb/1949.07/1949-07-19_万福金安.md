"May You Enjoy Boundless Blessings and Golden Peace"
		Ye Ming

	In the autumn of 1948, on the road to Suiyuan, just after crossing a patch of grassland and climbing a small earthen slope, a tall figure with two fan-like feet shuffling past me caught my attention. My heart skipped a beat, and I thought of a very familiar comrade. How could he be here? Maybe he was discharged and came back? No, maybe it wasn't him. As I was thinking, I asked the political instructor:
	"What's his name?"
	"Who?"
	"That tall guy who just passed by, the one with the big feet?"
	"Li Fugui, first platoon leader of the second company!" the political instructor told me.
	This immediately jogged my memory, and I realized that comrades from seven or eight years ago had met again in this frontier region.
	Seven or eight years ago, we were in the same company. He was a machine gunner in the machine gun squad, a particularly outstanding one. No one else could use the finicky "crooked-neck" machine gun well, but he could fire it without any problems. I was their cultural instructor. At that time, the War of Resistance Against Japan was at its most brutal. As soon as I was assigned to the company, I recognized him. He was the son of a poor peasant and a new recruit from the second conscription period. Because he had herded sheep in the mountains since he was a child, he was well-trained in aiming. As soon as he enlisted, he threw grenades far and accurately, earning everyone's respect. During the anti-mopping up campaign at Phoenix Mountain in 1941, he killed three Japanese devils with one grenade and captured a "crooked-neck" machine gun. At this time, the Party branch accepted him as a Communist Party member, and everyone asked him to teach them how to throw grenades. Later, he was transferred to the machine gun squad and used the gun he had captured himself. However, he had a flaw: he was impatient and liked to be difficult and argue stubbornly. If something didn't suit him, he could sulk for a whole day without saying a word. If you deliberately greeted him, he would turn his head away and ignore you. Because of this shortcoming, comrades raised many objections at the Party branch meeting when he was being considered for full membership.
	When I first went to work in this company, he didn't get close to me. Later, he only started interacting with me because he liked to write letters home. It turned out that he always asked the clerk to write letters for him. He would say a sentence, and the clerk would write it down. Finally, when there was nothing else to say, he would say, "Wishing you, elders, boundless blessings and golden peace," and the clerk would write it down. After writing it many times, the clerk would automatically write this routine greeting without waiting for him to say it, and he had no objections. However, the clerk happened to be an amusing person who often gave people nicknames, like "Flower Machine Gun," "Foreign Horse," "Father Comrade," "Burst," "Big Sand Dune," "Diamond"... so many people in the whole company had nicknames. As a result, Li Fugui was given the nickname "Boundless Blessings and Golden Peace." This made Li Fugui unhappy. He didn't write home for more than a month and would turn his head away when he saw the clerk. When the clerk asked him, "Write a letter?" he wouldn't answer. But everyone thought he had a strong sense of family, so the nickname was very appropriate. From then on, the new name "Boundless Blessings and Golden Peace" stuck. Although he himself was unhappy, everyone understood his temperament, and he would only be like this for a while and wouldn't cause too much trouble, so people still often called him that. After I wrote him a letter once, I understood this secret. I didn't call him by his nickname because I thought it was inevitable for a poor peasant child who had herded sheep to miss home, and I had a responsibility to help him study, so we got along well.
	The following spring, just as it was time to take off our cotton-padded clothes, the Japanese devils' May "mopping up" campaign began. At that time, he was sick and staying in a rear hospital. Our company was fighting in Ma'er Mountain. Because there were too many enemies, they surrounded us around the mountain. Every village was full of Japanese devils. At night, they lit fires everywhere and howled everywhere. During the day, they split up and searched the mountains. Our company lost contact with the main force and didn't dare to move rashly. As a result, we persevered for more than two days, regardless of casualties. On the third night, a messenger finally got through the enemy's blockade line and contacted us. The superiors ordered us to break through "Break through to the plains! Draw the enemy out!" At that time, people became busy, arranging the wounded, reorganizing the organization, and preparing to break through. The instructor told us: "Fight to the enemy's rear! Draw the enemy out!" However, because time passed too quickly, it was broad daylight when we broke down the mountain. We fought as we walked, and as a result, a machine gun that was providing cover in the rear was seized by the enemy. This machine gun was the "crooked-neck" that Li Fugui had captured. Everyone regretted losing the machine gun. Such a new and beautiful machine gun, which could fire continuously or in bursts as desired, was clean and crisp, and never malfunctioned, how could people not regret losing it? A machine gun that could equal the firepower of an infantry platoon in battle was lost, how could people not regret losing it? Maybe Li Fugui would cry a nosebleed? Maybe he wouldn't lose the machine gun.
	The May anti-mopping up campaign quickly ended in victory, and Li Fugui was quickly discharged from the hospital. He returned to our company to work. As soon as he returned to the company, he heard about the loss of the machine gun. He went to the company headquarters dejectedly. Before the company commander had spoken to him, the clerk came out: "Boundless Blessings and Golden Peace is back!" When Li Fugui heard this, he was even more annoyed. His face turned red, he turned his head away, and his neck stiffened, with veins popping out: "Bullshit! The machine gun doesn't have boundless blessings and golden peace!" I knew the clerk was joking in the wrong place and pulled him back. The clerk didn't speak. Li Fugui sat on the kang, not putting down his backpack and not saying a word, with a big lump like a bowl in his stomach. The company commander said a few words, and he went back to work in his squad. From then on, no one called him "Boundless Blessings and Golden Peace" anymore, and he didn't write home anymore.
	During the protection of the wheat harvest, we went down the mountain to operate in front of Tangxian city and fought two small battles. The enemy's machine guns always rattled non-stop, while Li Fugui's machine gun was always unreliable. At that time, it happened to be the streamlining of troops and administration, and he requested to be localized. Some people said, "Old family concept, he must want to retire!" Some said, "He used to write letters so diligently, but now he doesn't write anymore!" The platoon leader said, "Could he be having an emotional outburst!" The company commander said, "Not necessarily, he's been a soldier for one or two years, he's a Communist Party member, if he's in a bad mood, just leave him alone and he'll be fine." Li Fugui kept insisting on localization every day. Talking to the company or the regiment didn't work, so he went to work in the Dingtang Detachment.
	After that, we separated, and I never heard from him again. Today, seven or eight years later, we met again, and I was particularly happy. I really wanted to pat him on the back, but the troops were marching, and the platoon leader didn't have time to chat, so I started chatting with the political instructor during a break. The political instructor came from a student background and loved to introduce special things to people. This time, he opened his floodgates again:
	"This person is also a typical figure, quite interesting! Those big feet of his often come to me for 'bubble mushrooms' [to be interrogated]. Every time shoes are issued, he starts complaining. I said I'll give you some advice, and he said, 'Even if you give me advice, I still have to wear broken shoes.' Once, during training in Yi, Man, and Xu, I had no choice but to mobilize the villagers to make him a pair of big shoes. When the villagers were making them, it spread throughout the village. Everyone said the soles were like iron shovels. After they were made, he couldn't bear to wear them and hung them on the kang all day long. After staying there for a few days, he got anxious and asked every day when we were going to set off on a mission, as if his hands and feet were itching if he didn't march and fight!" After a while, he said again, "This person is just like that, sometimes annoying, sometimes really lovable!"
	I asked the political instructor, "Is he still as impatient as ever?"
	The political instructor said, "As impatient as Zhang Fei!" As he spoke, the battalion commander sat down beside us. "After new recruits were added, he held small classes after the big classes, and he did small exercises after the big exercises, so that there wasn't even time to shit or piss. The squad leaders complained, and he got unhappy, which made the squad leaders' morale low. You say he's active and responsible in his work, but precisely because he demands too much, the new recruits can't take it. All of a sudden, three ran away. We criticized him for having problems with his management methods, and he started picking on the squad leaders when he got back. The squad leaders were not convinced and almost started a fight! Think about it: how can new recruits endure this kind of life? Usually, at home, they can go to the fields when they want to go to the fields, and they can smoke when they want to smoke. There's not a single moment of free time here, plus some have family concerns, and none of the squad leaders want to do things this way, so they argue until their faces are red and their necks are thick!"
	"Are you talking about Li Fugui?" the battalion commander interjected with a smile. "That kid has a stubborn temper, and he's clumsy. The time we fought at Gubeikou, the enemy counterattacked several times, and several people in the platoon were injured. He got so angry that his eyes turned red. He picked up his machine gun and fired a burst, chasing and firing as he went, rushing out more than three hundred meters. He almost got captured by the enemy. That kid is both impatient and impulsive!"
	The march interrupted our conversation, making me feel even more affection for this person with a special personality.
	We settled down near Guihua City, and the troops besieged the enemy in the city. I took the opportunity to go to the second company to find him.
	One day, the sun was hiding behind the clouds, and the wind and sand from the Daqing Mountains blew from the north. Although it was only mid-autumn, the weather was already very cold. I went to the first platoon of the second company and asked where their platoon leader was. They said he was staying in the machine gun squad, so I went straight in.
	I walked into the machine gun squad. There were many people in the room, but it was very quiet. Only the small hammer was clanging. I walked in gently, and they didn't notice. I suddenly stood behind Li Fugui. He was assembling and cleaning his "crooked-neck" machine gun like a mechanic. He bent over, using the edge of the kang, holding the machine gun, assembling it piece by piece, tapping it piece by piece. It took him twenty-odd minutes to assemble it. Li Fugui carefully looked at the machine gun, put it on his shoulder, squinted his eyes, made a shooting posture, and then put the machine gun on the kang. He wiped his forehead, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.
	"That was hard!" I said.
	This sentence caused many people to raise their heads and look at me. Li Fugui froze for a moment, grabbed my hand: "How did you get here?"
	"I came to see you assemble the machine gun! —That was hard!"
	"Yes, this gun is the hardest to assemble. It has one hundred and thirty-one parts, more complicated than any other gun. You have to use a small hammer to assemble and disassemble it!" Li Fugui easily told me.
	I looked at Li Fugui. The big eyebrows and big eyes on his square face hadn't changed, but there were a few more wrinkles. I said, "Still the same!"
	"Haha! Just a bit older!" he said, then became a little unnatural. His big eyebrows and big eyes were moving like two flowers.
	After we talked for a while, we talked about the past. He was unhappy with the clerk, unhappy about losing the machine gun, unhappy that others said he had a strong sense of family, and also unhappy that others said he had a strong sense of position.
	"Think about it, how can you not be sad when you lose the machine gun you captured yourself!" He spoke of the past: "After that, I was in a bad mood. It wasn't for anything. It was during the protection of the wheat harvest that I discovered this machine gun was on the Nan Diantou blockhouse. I was determined to recapture it, so I requested to be in the infantry squad and insisted on localization!"
	As he spoke, I remembered the situation when he was insisting on localization and in a bad mood. He didn't do anything all day long and couldn't talk to anyone. I said, "Who knew you had your own ideas back then?"
	"After I was localized, I attacked Nan Diantou, captured seven live devils, and recaptured it!" As he spoke, he pointed to the machine gun on the kang. My heart couldn't help but surge with admiration and joy. Although I didn't agree with his emotional outbursts, "During the large-scale field battle, when we counterattacked, I carried her out again!"
	"You're married to it! Haha!" He laughed when I said that.
	"You say, can you be happy if your wife is lost? The clerk even mocked me as Boundless Blessings and Golden Peace!"
	"Would you be willing to be called Boundless Blessings and Golden Peace now?" I asked.
	"It's not much even if the machine gun is back..." he said awkwardly: "No one here knows!"
	He also talked about how it helped in the battles of Gubeikou and Jining, especially in the battle of Bulaoshu, where he used it to defeat the enemy's five offensives. "This thing is really useful. I wouldn't mind losing a squad, but I can't do without it!" Finally, he said, "Not many people use it now. Every time I clean the gun, I give everyone a demonstration. When we're in a hurry during battle, I pick it up. It's worn out my cotton coat, and I've worn out its gunstock. It's really a good couple!" As he spoke, many people in the squad laughed!
	"Are you still as impatient as ever?" I asked him.
	"No! Impatience doesn't work!"
	Soon, when I saw Li Fugui again, he had already been promoted to deputy company commander, with a red cloth-wrapped Mauser pistol slung across his body. I asked him, "Boundless Blessings and Golden Peace?" He smiled, "Not boundless blessings and golden peace! The machine gun was damaged in the Battle of Jining!"
	"How is it?"
	"It doesn't matter, it's already been repaired!"
	"It's already boundless blessings and golden peace!"
	He laughed, laughed out loud, with a pair of big eyebrows and big eyes, like two flowers in motion.

    “万福金安”
    野明
    一九四八年秋天，出征绥远的道路上，刚穿过一片草地，爬上一个土坡的时候，一个高大的影子，两只扇子似的大脚一拖一拖的从我身边走过去了，我的心里一怔，想起了一个很熟悉的战友。怎么他在这里呢？可能是退了伍又回来的吧？不，也许不是他。我心里在想着，随后问了一声教导员：
    “他叫什么名字？”
    “那一个？”
    “刚过去那个大个子，一双大脚板？”
    “李福贵，二连一排长！”教导员告诉了我。
    这一下把我的记忆提醒了，我们这七八年前的战友今天在塞外又遇在一起了。
    七八年前我们在一个连上，他是机枪班的一个射手，特别出色的一个射手，谁也用不好的歪把子机枪，他打起来一点故障也没有。我给他们当文化教员。那时节，正是抗日战争残酷的时候，我一调到连上，就认识了他，他是一个贫农的儿子，又是二期整军时的一个新战士，因为从小在山上放羊，对瞄准很有锻炼，一入伍投弹就又远又准，博得大伙的重视。四一年反扫荡打凤凰山曾经一颗手榴弹炸死三个日本鬼子，缴了一挺歪把子机枪，这时候，支部接受他为共产党员，大家伙也都找他学投弹；以后，他调到机枪班，就用他自己缴的这挺枪。可是他有一个缺点，性子急燥，好闹蹩扭，死抬杠，一不合他的心意能蹩住一天不说话，你假若故意和他打招呼，他会一扭头不答理你。因为这个缺点，在通过他转成正式党员的时候，支部大会上同志们还提了很多意见。
    我刚去这个连工作的时候，他不怎么和我接近，以后因为他爱写家信才和我打了交道。原来他总是找文书给他写家信，他说一句文书给他写一句，最后没事了他就说：“敬祝大人万福金安”一句，文书就给他写上，以后写的多了，文书就不等他说，自动的写了这一句照例的问候，他也没有意见。可是，文书偏偏是个有趣的人，经常给人送外号，花机关啦，大洋马啦，父亲同志啦，一梭子啦，大沙高啦，金钢钻啦……送的全连好多人都有了外号，结果给李福贵送了个“万福金安”的大号，这一下李福贵不高兴了，有一个多月没写家信，见了文书就一扭头走了，文书问他“写信不？”他也不答理，可是别人总以为他家庭观念浓厚，这外号很合适，从此“万福金安”的新名字就叫起来了，虽说他自己不高兴，可是别人都摸透了他的脾气，他只有这么一遭，不会闹的怎么下不去，所以人们仍然经常叫他。我从给他写了一次信以后，知道了这个底细，我就不叫他的外号，因为我认为一个贫农出身的放羊孩子想家是不可免的，并有责任帮助他学习，所以我们俩还搞的来。
    第二年春天，正是要脱棉衣的时候，日本鬼子的五月大“扫荡”开始了，当时他有病住了后方医院，我们连在马耳山作战，因为敌人过分的多，在山的周围包围了我们，每个村子住满了鬼子，一到夜晚就四处烧火，到处嚎叫，白天就分路向山里搜“剿”，我们一个连和主力失了联络，又不敢随便行动，结果不顾伤亡坚持了两天多，第三天晚上一个通讯员才通过敌人封锁线和我们接上头，上级命令我们突围“向平原突！把敌人引出去！”当时人们就忙起来了，按置伤员，整顿组织，准备突围。指导员给我们说：“打到敌人后边去！把敌人引出去！”可是，因为时间过的太快，当我们突下山以后，天就大亮了，和敌人边打边走，结果在后边掩护的一挺机枪被敌人夺走了。这机枪就是李福贵缴的那挺歪把子，丢了机枪以后人人都很可惜。那么一挺又新又漂亮，打起来要连发就连发要点发就点发，又清又脆，又不发生故障的机枪丢掉了，怎能不叫人可惜呢？作战时能顶一个步兵排的火力的机枪丢了，怎能不叫人可惜呢？恐怕李福贵还要哭一鼻子呢？也许他在机枪丢不了。
    五月反扫荡很快就胜利结束了，李福贵也很快出了院，他又回到我们连工作，一回来没到连上他就听说了丢机枪的事，垂头丧气的到了连部，连长还没和他谈话，文书就出来了：“万福金安回来了！”李福贵一听心里更烦了，脸一红，头一扭，脖子一挺，青筋在脖子上跳起来了：“球！机枪可不万福金安啦！”我知道文书没耍在正经地方，拉了他一把，文书不说话了，李福贵坐在炕头上，背包不放，话也不说，肚子里蹩了一个碗似的大疙瘩；连长说了两句话，他就又回班里工作了，从此再也没人叫他“万福金安”了，他也不给家里写信了。
    保卫麦收的时候，我们下山活动在唐县城根前，打了两个小仗。敌人的机枪总是哗哗哗的响个不停，而李福贵的机枪总是不顺意，当时正赶上精兵简政他要求地方化，有的人说：“老家庭观念，一定是想退伍啦！”有的说：“过去寄信可勤啦，现在也不写了！”排长说：“敢是闹情绪哩吧！”连长说：“不一定，好吧赖吧是个一二年的兵，是个共产党员，他这扭脾气，别管他就没事啦。”李福贵就一天价提意见地方化，连里团里谈都不顶事，结果他是到定唐支队去工作了。
    以后我们就分开了，再也没听到他的消息，今天，在这七八年以后的今天又见面了，我心里就特别高兴，很想和他拍打一阵子，可是部队行军，排长是没有空闲扯的，于是在休息的时候就和教导员扯起来。教导员是学生出身，很爱给人介绍个特殊的事物，这一下又打开了他的话匣子：
    “这人也是典型人物，够有趣哩！他那一双大脚经常来给我泡蘑菇，一发鞋子就讲怪话，我说给你提意见，他说提意见也得穿破鞋，有一次在易满徐练兵的时候，没办法我动员老乡给他做了一双大鞋，老乡做的时候，传遍了全村，都说底子象铁锨一样，做好了以后，他又舍不得穿，成天挂在炕头上，住下后几天，他就急了，每天问什么时候出发执行任务，好象不行军打仗手脚都发痒一样！”停了一会他又说：“这个人就是那么股劲，有时气人，有时真是令人爱！”
    我问教导员：“他还是那么性急呀？”
    教导员说：“性急的赛张飞！”说着营长也坐在一边了。“在补了新兵以后，上了大课他上小课，出了大操他出小操，闹的连个拉屎撒尿的时间也没有，班长们提意见，他又不高兴，闹的班长们也情绪不高，你说吧工作积极负责，正是因为他要求的太严格，新兵经不起，一家伙跑了三个，我们批评他管理方法有毛病，回去就刻起班长来了，班长们不服气，差一点没打起来！你想想：新兵那里经的起这种生活呢？平常在家里想下地，下地，想抽烟，抽烟，到这一点空也没有，再加有些家庭观念，班长们谁也不愿这样办，吵的脸红脖子粗的！”
    “你们说的李福贵吧？”营长也笑着插了嘴：“那小子有个扭脾气，粗手粗脚的，那回打古北口，敌人反冲锋了好几次，排里伤了几个人，他气的眼都红了，端起机枪就是一梭子，一边追一边打，冲出去三百多米达，差一点没叫敌人搞住他，这小子是又急又楞！”
    行军打断了我们的谈话，使我对这个特殊性格的人更加快感。
    在归绥城附近住下了，部队围困城里的敌人，我抽机会专去二连找他。
    一天，太阳藏在云彩后边，大青山的风沙从北边吹来，虽然才只是中秋时节，气候却已经很冷了。我到了二连一排，问他们排长在那里，他们说在机枪班住，我就迳直的走进去了。
    我走进了机枪班，屋子里很多人，可是静的很，只有小铁锤在叮当叮当的敲打，我轻轻地走进去，他们都没有注意，我一下就站在李福贵的后边，他正在象一个机器匠一样装擦他的歪把子机枪，他弯着腰，就着炕沿，端着机枪，一件一件的装，一个一个的敲打，停了有二十几分钟，才把它装好，李福贵仔细的看了一下机枪，端在肩膀上一试眼睛一眯缝，作了个射击姿势，才把机枪放在炕上，他擦了一下额盖，人们都出了一口气。
    “好不容易啊！”我说了一句。
    这一句话引起好多人抬起头来看我，李福贵楞了一下，抓住我的手：“你怎么来啦？”
    “我来看你们上机枪来啦！——好不容易呵！”
    “是的，这枪是最难上的枪，一百三十一个零件，比什么枪都复杂，上卸都得用小锤！”李福贵很容易地告诉了我。
    我看着李福贵，四方脸上的大眉毛大眼都没有变化，只是多了几条绉纹，我说：“还是那样呵！”
    “哈哈！就是老了一些！”说着又有些不自然了，大眉毛大眼象两朵花一样在动。
    我们叙了一段话以后，谈起了过去，他对文书不高兴，对丢机枪的事不高兴，对别人说他家庭观念不高兴，说他地位观念也不高兴。
    “你想想，自己夺的机枪丢了，怎么能不难过！”他说起了往事：“以后闹情绪，什也不为，就是保卫麦收的时候，我发现了这机枪在南店头炮楼上，我一心要再夺回来，才要求下步枪班，才闹地方化！”
    他说着我想起了他地方化闹情绪时候的情形，他一天什也不干，和谁也说不在一起，我说：“当时谁知道你有自己的主意呢？”
    “我地方化了以后，打下了南店头，捉了七个活鬼子，把它又夺回来了！”他说着用手指了一下炕上的机枪，我的心里不禁涌上钦佩和欣喜，我虽然不同意他闹情绪，“在大野战的时候，反攻了，我又扛着她出来了！”
    “你和它结了婚啦！哈哈！”我一说他笑起来了。
    “你说老婆丢了还能高兴？文书还讽刺我万福金安哩！”
    “现在叫你万福金安该愿意了吧？”我问。
    “机枪回来了也没什么……”他不好意思了：“这里也没人知道！”
    他又谈到了以后打古北口，打集宁它怎么顶事，怎么在他手下出力，尤其在不老树战斗里，用它打垮敌人五次冲锋，“这家伙正经顶事哩，少个班我没意见，没它可不行！”最后他说：“现在用它的人不多，每次擦一回枪，我给大家作个示范，打仗的时候，一急我就端起她来了，它磨破了我的棉袄，我磨光了它的枪把，正经是一对好夫妻哩！”说着说着班里好多人都笑起来了！
    “你还是那么性急呀”我问他。
    “不了！性急吃不开！”
    不久，我又见李福贵的时候，他已经提拔了副连长，身上斜挎着一支红布包的很严实的驳壳枪，我问他“万福金安吧”，他笑了笑，“不万福金安！机枪在集宁战斗里打坏了！”
    “怎么样？”
    “不要紧，已经修好了！”
    “已经万福金安了！”
    他笑了，笑的出了声，一付大眉毛大眼，好象两朵花在动。
          一九四九、三、于石家庄
