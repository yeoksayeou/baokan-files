    Literary and Art Circles and the Music Community of Beiping City
    Hold a Gathering to Commemorate Nie Er
    [Our Newspaper] Yesterday (the 17th) was the 14th anniversary of the death of the people's musician Nie Er. All the music working representatives of the National Literary and Art Congress and the music community of Beiping City held a grand commemorative evening at the Dahua Cinema at 7:30 last night. Zhou Weizhi, a music working representative of the Literary and Art Congress, reported on Nie Er's life and revolutionary deeds, as well as his great contributions, creative content, and creative methods. Zhou said: Nie Er was not only a great people's musician, but also an outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party. Unfortunately, he died at the age of 24 under the cruel oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Lu Yi Sound Workers Troupe sang a dirge, and the Korean Cultural Troupe and the Northeast Cultural and Educational Team performed commemorative programs. (Bai Sheng)
