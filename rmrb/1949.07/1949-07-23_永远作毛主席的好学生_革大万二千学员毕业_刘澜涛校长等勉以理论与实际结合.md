　　Forever Be Good Students of Chairman Mao
  　12,000 Graduates of the Revolutionary University
    President Liu Lantao and Others Encourage Integration of Theory and Practice
    [Report from this newspaper] The first class of over 12,000 students at the North China People's Revolutionary University has victoriously completed their studies under the correct educational policy of the Chinese Communist Party, the direct leadership of the CCP North China Bureau, and the joint efforts of all school staff and students, and are about to depart for various work posts across the country. Yesterday (the 22nd), 10,000 students in Ping held a graduation ceremony at the Xiyuan campus, presided over by President Liu Lantao. Guests included Wang Congwu, a member of the CCP North China Bureau, and Comrade Nie Zhen, a representative of North China University.
    Revolutionary University students have made significant progress in their thinking, work style, and living habits through four months of studying basic Marxist-Leninist theories. They have initially established a proletarian revolutionary worldview, begun to master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and actively requested to join revolutionary organizations. Over two hundred students have gloriously joined the Communist Party, and over four thousand five hundred have joined the Communist Youth League. Due to the rapid development of the revolutionary victory situation and work needs, the school decided to end the originally planned six-month study period early. With a high degree of conscious organizational discipline and a determination to serve the people, the vast majority of students excitedly expressed their willingness to unconditionally obey organizational assignments, and have been busy settling family affairs and preparing luggage in recent days. Armies and administrative organs in North China, Northwest China, Jiangnan, and other regions have dispatched special personnel to the school to welcome students to work in various regions. These comrades from various places in Ping were warmly welcomed by all the students. At yesterday's graduation ceremony, President Liu Lantao, Comrade Wang Congwu, Comrade Nie Zhen, and others encouraged the students to integrate the theories they learned with practical work at their work posts; to have a clear stance; and to handle all problems in accordance with Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought. They were also urged to use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to examine their work and thoughts, to constantly learn and progress, to resolutely integrate with workers and peasants in life, work style, and thought, to truly implement the mass line in action, and to honestly serve the people. After Comrade Wang Jianmin, representing comrades from various regions who came to the school to welcome the students, paid revolutionary respects to the graduating students, student representatives spoke freely, unanimously expressing their gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, the people, and the revolutionary furnace—their alma mater—for the education they received. They vowed to respond to the call of higher authorities with practical actions, to humbly learn from the masses, and to wholeheartedly serve the people. Then, students from each branch presented flags to their alma mater. For a time, red flags with slogans such as "Serve the People with What We Have Learned," "Come for the People, Go for the People," "Forever Be Good Students of Mao Zedong," and "Advance Under the Banner of Mao Zedong" filled the stage, and the applause from the audience was endless.
