Suiyuan Electric Dispatch: Industrial and commercial bureaus in counties in eastern Sui actively organize the export of grain and specialty products in exchange for cloth. In June, the amount of grain exported reached 10,076,000 jin (including 9,210,000 jin of wheat transported to Tianjin and Beijing). A fur shop was established in Jining in late May. In June, the counties collected 126,000 jin of wool and 4,000 jin of bristles, about one-third of which had been transported to Tianjin. In addition, more than 20,000 jin of melon seeds, which are abundant in western Sui, were registered and shipped out by the industrial and commercial bureaus. The necessities exchanged back in June included more than 52,400 bolts of homespun cloth transported from Baoding and Datong, more than 2,000 bolts of various kinds of foreign cloth, and more than 100 jin of white sugar from Tianjin and Beijing. In June, the industrial and commercial bureaus' retail departments alone sold more than 52,100 bolts of homespun cloth and more than 5,000 bolts of foreign cloth to the masses, solving part of the farmers' summer clothing needs. In order to continuously promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the industrial and commercial bureaus in various counties also used cloth to exchange for grain. According to statistics from the Suiyuan Provincial Industrial and Commercial Bureau, 6.1 million jin of coarse grains were exchanged in June. The biggest difficulty affecting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas is that mass-based production and marketing cooperatives have not yet been established at all levels. For example, many farm families in Helin, southern Sui, still have four or five years' worth of wool that no one is collecting.

　　绥东各县工商局
  　输出粮千万斤换回大批布匹
    【绥远电】绥东各县工商局积极组织粮食特产输出，换回布匹。六月份内，输出的粮食达一千零七十六万斤（内有运平津的小麦九百二十一万斤）。五月下旬在集宁成立皮毛店，六月份内各县已收毛十二万六千斤，猪鬃四千斤，约有三分之一已运到天津。此外绥西盛产之瓜子，经工商局登记运出的即达两万多斤。换回的必需品，六月份内计有从保定、大同运回的土布五万二千四百多匹，另从平津运来各色洋布两千多匹，白糖一百多斤。在六月份内，光各县工商局门市部即售与群众土布五万二千一百多匹，洋布五千多匹，解决了农民夏衣的一部分。各县工商局为使城乡物资不断交流，又用布再换粮食。据绥远省工商局统计，六月份已换回杂粮六百一十万斤。目前影响城乡物资交流的最大困难，是各级尚未建立群众性的生产供销合作社，如绥南和林不少农家，尚存有四、五年的羊毛，没人去收。
