Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 16th: Full text of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's speech at the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association:

    Gentlemen,

    Today, representatives of our various democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic democratic figures are gathering here to hold a conference and initiate the preparation for the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. This is to further develop and consolidate the profound friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. This is a matter of extremely great significance.

    The experience of the past thirty-two years has fully proven that the great socialist state, the Soviet Union, is the closest and most reliable friend of the Chinese people. As soon as the October Revolution was victorious, it abolished all the unequal treaties Tsarist Russia had imposed on China. Through the introduction of the Russians, we Chinese found Marxism. From then on, the face of the Chinese revolution was completely renewed, and the Chinese people's struggle for liberation was no longer isolated. The people of the Soviet Union and all countries were helping the Chinese people. The Chinese working class and laboring people learned from the experience of the Russian Revolution and established their own political party, the Chinese Communist Party. Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's old Three People's Principles were transformed into the new Three People's Principles with their three great policies, which led to the vigorous Northern Expedition. Precisely for this reason, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, on his deathbed, earnestly exhorted everyone to "unite with those nations in the world that treat us equally and fight together." He also wrote a letter to the Soviet Union, calling it the "leader of the union of free republics, where refugees under imperialism will be able to defend their freedom and seek liberation."

    However, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries betrayed Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition. They refused to unite with the Soviet Union, instead opposing it. They refused to unite with the Communist Party, instead opposing it. As a result, they invited the large-scale invasion of Japanese imperialism. Under the call and promotion of the Chinese Communist Party and various patriotic democratic parties, the Chinese people rose up to resist Japan. And the first country in the world to truly help the Chinese people resist Japanese imperialism, both spiritually and materially, was none other than the Soviet Union. Until the final decisive moment of the War of Resistance, the Soviet Red Army dispatched troops to Northeast China, thoroughly defeating and eliminating the Japanese warlords' ace Kwantung Army, thereby facilitating the surrender of Japanese imperialism. Based on the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the entire Chinese people have resolutely opposed the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, in China for three years, and have achieved unprecedentedly great victories.

    From this, it can be seen that the victory of our Chinese people's democratic revolution is inseparable from the friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union. If there had been no Soviet Union, if there had been no victory in the anti-fascist Second World War led by the Soviet Union, if there had been no unprecedented growth of the world democratic and peace camp led by the Soviet Union for the past four years, our Chinese revolution could not have achieved such rapid and great victories as it has now. Even if it had been victorious, it would not have been possible to consolidate it. Isn't this obvious?

    In the future, our task is to eliminate the remaining forces of the reactionaries and to carry out the economic, cultural, and educational construction of the people with great strength. We must build our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, and then gradually move from New Democracy to Socialism and Communism. Here, we have the best teacher, and that is the Soviet Union. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people have built a brilliant socialist country and are now completing the first post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, gradually moving towards Communism. Our workers, peasants, scientists, technicians, teachers, artists, and experts in various departments should humbly learn from the Soviet Union, learning their various construction experiences and scientific culture, and applying them to the construction of our own great motherland.

    The purpose of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association we are initiating is to develop and consolidate the profound friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, to introduce the experience and scientific culture of the Soviet Union's construction in various fields to the entire Chinese people, to work hand in hand with the Soviet Union, and to wage an unyielding struggle for lasting world peace and people's democracy under the leadership of the Soviet Union. I believe that our great and just cause will surely succeed.

### 中苏友好协会发起人大会上  朱总司令讲话全文

    中苏友好协会发起人大会上
    朱总司令讲话全文
    【新华社北平十六日电】朱总司令在中苏友好协会发起人大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    诸位先生：
    今天我们各民主党派、各人民团体、和各界爱国民主人士的代表人物，在这里开大会，发起筹备中苏友好协会的组织，以便进一步发展和巩固中苏两国人民的深厚友谊。这是一件有极其重大意义的事情。
    三十二年来的经验充分证明了，伟大的社会主义国家苏联是中国人民最亲密、最可靠的朋友。十月革命一胜利，它就废除了沙皇俄国对中国的一切不平等条约。经过俄国人的介绍，我们中国人，找到了马克思主义。从此，中国革命的面目为之一新，中国人民的解放斗争就不再是孤立的了。苏联和各国的人民都是帮助中国人民的。中国工人阶级及劳苦人民学习了俄国革命的经验，成立了自己的政党中国共产党。由于苏联和中国共产党的帮助，孙中山先生的旧三民主义，才变成了三大政策的新三民主义，因此才有以后的轰轰烈烈的北伐战争。正因为这样，孙中山先生临终时，还谆谆嘱咐大家要“联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗。”还要写信给苏联，称它为“自由的共和国大联合之首领，帝国主义下的难民将借此以保卫其自由，并谋得解放。”
    但是蒋介石反动派背叛了孙中山先生的主张，它不要联合苏联，而要反对苏联，不要联合共产党，而要反对共产党，结果就引进了日本帝国主义的大举进攻。中国人民在中国共产党和各爱国民主党派号召和推动下面，奋起抗战。而世界上第一个真正在精神和物质上帮助中国人民抵抗日本帝国主义的，不是别个，就是苏联。直到抗战的最后决定关头，苏联红军出兵东北，彻底击败和消灭了日本军阀的王牌关东军，由此而促成了日本帝国主义的投降。中国共产党中国人民解放军和全中国人民三年以来就在抗日胜利的基础上，坚决反对美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动集团在中国的反动统治，取得了空前伟大的胜利。
    由此可见，我们中国人民民主革命的胜利是和苏联的友谊援助分不开的。假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有由苏联领导的反法西斯第二为次大战的胜利，假如没有四年以来以苏联为领袖的世界民主和平阵营的空前壮大，我们中国革命象目前这样迅速伟大的胜利，是不可能的。即是胜利了，要巩固也是不可能的。这难道还不明显吗？
    今后我们的任务是要肃清反动派的残余力量，是要用极大的力量进行人民的经济和文化教育的建设。我们要把我们的国家，从一个落后的农业国建设成为一个先进的工业国，以后还要从新民主主义逐步地走向社会主义和共产主义。这里我们有一个最好的老师，那就是苏联。苏联人民在列宁和斯大林领导之下，已经建设起一个光辉灿烂的社会主义国家，现在正在提早完成战后第一个五年计划，逐步地走向共产主义。我们的工人们、农民们、科学家、技术家、教师、文艺家和各部门的专家们，都应当虚心地向苏联学习，学习他们的各种建设经验和科学文化，用到我们自己的伟大祖国的建设上面来。
    我们要发起成立的中苏友好协会，其目的就是要发展和巩固中苏两大民族的深厚友谊，向全中国人民介绍苏联各方面建设的经验和科学文化，和苏联携手并进，并在苏联的领导下，为世界的持久和平与人民民主进行不屈不挠的斗争。我相信我们这一伟大正义的事业是一定会成功的。
