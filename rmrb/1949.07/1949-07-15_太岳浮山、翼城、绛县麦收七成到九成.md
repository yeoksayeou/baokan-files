News Briefs

　　▲In the three counties of Fushan, Yicheng, and Jiangxian under the Second Administrative Office, this year's wheat production has increased, reaching approximately 70% to 90% of the expected yield. The total wheat field area in the three counties is 837,000 mu, with an estimated increase of over 52,850 shi compared to last year. The reasons for the increased production are the correct implementation of the policies to conclude land reform and rectify the Party, and the active leadership of the Party and government at all levels in mass production. When sowing wheat last autumn, the cultivation was more meticulous than in the past. In Dongshoucheng Village, Yicheng, the land was universally plowed four times before sowing. This spring, efforts were made to combat replanting, weeding, seedling protection, frost damage, and insect pests, leading to these results.

　　太岳浮山、翼城、绛县
  　麦收七成到九成
    ▲二专署所属浮山、翼城、绛县三县今年麦子增产，约达应产量的七成至九成。三县八十三万七千余亩麦田，约计较去年增产五万二千八百五十余石。增产的原因为正确执行结束土改和整党政策、各地党和政府积极领导群众生产，去秋种麦时就耕作得比过去都细致。翼城东寿城村种前普遍犁过四遍，今春又以补种、锄苗保苗和冻灾虫灾等作斗争，才获得了这样的成果。
