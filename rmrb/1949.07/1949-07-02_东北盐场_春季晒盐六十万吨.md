Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. The salt fields under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Administrative Committee Salt Affairs Bureau had completed the production of 600,000 tons of salt as of early June, accounting for 85.7% of this year's salt production plan of 700,000 tons, exceeding last year's total salt production of more than 400,000 tons by approximately 50%. The Northeast salt field area totals more than 35,200 hectares, distributed along the coastline extending more than 2,000 li from Gushan County in Liaodong Province in the east to Shanhaiguan in the west. Each year, the maximum salt production via solar evaporation can reach 1.5 million tons, accounting for half of the country's salt production. During the puppet Manchukuo regime, the Japanese imperialists extensively developed salt fields to plunder Northeast salt as industrial raw materials. By 1944, the completed salt flats amounted to more than 33,200 hectares, employing 21,400 salt workers, with an annual salt production of 1.3 million tons. After the Japanese surrender, all salt fields in various regions were controlled by the Kuomintang. Most of the salt field machinery, power, and other equipment were stolen or destroyed by them. Except for the salt fields in western Liaoning and Yingkou and Gaiping areas, which could produce 35,000 tons of salt annually, the remaining salt fields were all abandoned. After the liberation of various regions, salt production gradually recovered. This year, the area of salt fields that have resumed production is more than 24,600 hectares, totaling more than 5,700 fu dou (one fu dou is the area that can be managed by two and a half people using water ladles to draw water, approximately equivalent to 20 mu). In terms of equipment, there are more than 400 water pumps with a total of more than 3,300 horsepower. The various salt fields employ more than 15,000 salt workers and more than 900 electrical and carpentry workers. Based on the existing equipment capacity, the annual salt production this year can reach 800,000 to 900,000 tons, which can be restored to 60% to 70% of the production level during the puppet Manchukuo period.

　　东北盐场
  　春季晒盐六十万吨
    【新华社沈阳一日电】东北行政委员会盐务管理局所辖各盐场，截至六月上旬止，已完成春季晒盐六十万吨，占今年产盐计划七十万吨的百分之八十五点七，约超过去年全年产盐四十余万吨的百分之五十。东北盐田面积共有三万五千二百余公顷，分布在东起辽东省孤山县西至山海关二千余里的海岸线上，每年借日光曝晒，最高可产盐一百五十万吨，占全国盐产的半数。伪满时日寇为掠夺东北食盐充作工业原料，曾大量开辟盐田，一九四四年已修成的盐滩三万三千二百余公顷，有盐工二万一千四百名，年产盐一百三十万吨。日本投降后，各地盐田全部为国民党控制，盐场机器动力等设备大部被其盗卖或破坏，除辽西及营口、盖平地区盐田每年可产盐三万五千吨外，其余盐田悉数荒废。各地解放后，盐产逐渐恢复。今年已恢复生产的盐田面积为二万四千六百余公顷，共五千七百余付斗（一付斗为两个半人用水斗扬水所能经营的面积，约等于二十亩），设备方面有扬水机四百余台，共三千三百多马力。各盐场共有盐工一万五千余名，电气及木工工人九百余名。根据现有设备能力，今年全年可产盐八十万至九十万吨，可恢复到伪满时生产水平的百分之六十至七十。
