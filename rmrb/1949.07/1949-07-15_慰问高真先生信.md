Letter of Condolences to Mr. Gao Zhen:

Mr. Gao Zhen:

Today is the third anniversary of Mr. Wen's martyrdom. Mr. Wen's literary virtue and his frank, selfless pursuit of truth and revolutionary spirit have always been admired by his colleagues. Unfortunately, he was poisoned by the reactionaries. At the time, all the people of China were heartbroken and indignant at this brutal act and rose up to resist. Now, thanks to the heroic battles of the People's Liberation Army and the efforts of the people across the country, the reactionary rule has basically collapsed, and the overall victory of the revolution is in sight. Mr. Wen's blood was not shed in vain, and Mr. Wen's revolutionary aspirations have been achieved. We believe that Mr. Wen will be forever remembered by all literary and art workers in China, and even by all the people of China, and his glory will last forever with the Chinese nation. All the comrades of the congress unanimously expressed their remembrance and respect for Mr. Wen. We hereby send this special letter to convey our sentiments and offer our democratic regards!

Respectfully,
The Entirety of the Representatives of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers of China
July 15th

　　慰问高真先生信高真先生：
    今天是闻先生殉难的第三周年。闻先生的文章道德和他的坦白无私追求真理的革命精神，一向为同人所敬慕，乃竟不幸遭反动派的毒手。对此种残暴行为，当时全中国的人民莫不痛心疾首，奋起以图反抗，现在由于人民解放军的英勇作战与全国人民的努力，反动的统治基本上已经垮台，革命的全面胜利已经在望。闻先生的血是没有白流的，而闻先生的革命遗志也已经达到了。我们相信，闻先生将为全中国的文学艺术界同人，以至于全中国的人民永远怀念，和中华民族的光荣永垂不朽。大会同人一致对闻先生表示追念和敬意，特此专函奉达，并致民主敬礼！
    中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会全体同人谨上　七月十五日
