Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 18th: TASS, New York, 16th: Anderson, secretary of the Preparatory Committee of the "National Labor Conference for Peace," recently sent a telegram on behalf of 1,500 senior officials from local trade unions of the CIO, AFL, and independent unions across the United States to all senators, urging them to reject the North Atlantic Treaty. The telegram stated: "Despite the declarations of national trade union leaders, it is quite clear that the rank and file union members and their local leaders do not agree to support the North Atlantic Treaty. Organized labor is against the treaty. Like the Marshall Plan, this war pact will not give us work. What American labor needs is peace and work, not war and destruction." Anderson announced that the National Labor Conference for Peace has decided to convene a conference of trade union leaders in Chicago on October 1st and 2nd to discuss peace issues.

Other respected individuals and groups are also intensifying their struggle against the North Atlantic Treaty. The Chicago correspondent of the Worker's Daily reported: Bishop Thompson of the University of Chicago Church announced to reporters: "The Chicago Committee to Substitute Peaceful Means for the North Atlantic Treaty" has been formed. The members of this committee recently signed an open letter to Truman and Congress, protesting against the North Atlantic Treaty and the plan to arm Europe. The National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association issued a statement to the press, calling on friends of peace to send telegrams to senators, urging them to extend the Senate debate time and reject the North Atlantic Treaty. The Worker's Daily reported that the League of Women Voters' branch at a meeting in Burlington, Vermont, expressed opposition to the North Atlantic Treaty. The Worker's Daily urged its readers: "Tell your elected senators to refuse to accept this provocation. Let Americans expand on the gains made in Paris, and not sweep them away with a new war pact."

    力促否决侵略公约
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：“全国劳工拥护和平会议”筹备委员会秘书安得生，顷代表全美各地产联、劳联与独立工会的地方工会高级人员一千五百名，致电全体参议员，力促否决北大西洋公约。该电称：“尽管有全国性工会领袖们的声明，然而，十分明显，工会会员群众和他们的地方领袖并不同意支持北大西洋公约。有组织的劳工是反对公约的。正象马歇尔计划一样，这个战争公约也不会给我们工作，美国劳工所需要的东西是和平与工作，而不是战争与破坏”。安得生宣布：全国劳工拥护和平会议决定于十月一、二两日在芝加哥召开工会领袖会议，讨论和平问题。
    其他有声望的人士和团体也在加强进行反对北大西洋公约的斗争。工人日报芝加哥记者报道：芝加哥大学的教会主教汤普生向记者宣布：“芝加哥争取以和平办法代替北大西洋公约委员会”业已组成。这个委员会的委员们，最近签署致杜鲁门和国会的一封公开信，抗议北大西洋公约和武装欧洲的计划。美苏友好协会全国委员会向报界发表声明，号召和平之友致电参议员，力促延长参院辩论时间并否决北大西洋公约。工人日报载称：妇女选民同盟的分会在佛蒙特州柏林敦召开的会议，表示反对北大西洋公约。工人日报力促读者：“告诉你们选举的参议员拒绝接受这种挑拨。让美国人扩大在巴黎所获致的成果，而不要用新的战争公约把它们一扫而光”。
