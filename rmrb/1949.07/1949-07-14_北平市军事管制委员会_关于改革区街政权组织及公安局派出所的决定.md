　　The important characteristic of a modern city is concentration: concentration of population, concentration of politics, economy, and culture, and extremely convenient transportation. Furthermore, the main masses are the concentrated working class. This is fundamentally different from the countryside, where the population is scattered, the economy is dispersed, transportation is inconvenient, and the main masses are individual, scattered peasants. Therefore, the organizational forms and working methods of cities should also be different.

　　In the countryside, the township (village) government and mass organizations (such as farmers', youth, and women's associations) are the basic level. In the city, there should be no street-level government and mass organizations at all. Districts should have district offices, but they should not be a level of government. All work should be concentrated at the city level as much as possible, otherwise, the work that should be decided and carried out by the municipal government (or the municipal trade union, etc.) in a unified manner will be wrongly divided, causing a very chaotic phenomenon in the work.

　　Secondly, in the countryside, because the villages are scattered and transportation is extremely inconvenient, the work of the leading organs above the county level often has to adopt some indirect methods. Conversely, in the city, the leading organs of the city-level Party, government, military, and civilians not only can but should adopt direct working methods as much as possible, such as summoning relevant personnel at any time to discuss and explain face-to-face, or using telephones, newspapers, broadcasts, and other means to carry out various tasks, which is both quick and accurate. Conversely, if the set of working methods in the countryside is mechanically moved, it is actually very easy to form slow work efficiency and numerous errors.

　　At the beginning of our entry into the city, because Peiping was peacefully taken over, the social situation was complex, and enemy agents and stray soldiers had planned to lie dormant in advance. The vast majority of the working class was not yet organized, the huge old police organization and personnel had no time to be reformed, and each district organized working groups with a small number of veteran cadres and a large number of workers and student activists, and dispatched them to each bao to work, responsible for investigating and understanding some of the city's conditions, publicizing the Party and government's policies, reflecting some of the citizens' demands, and responsible for carrying out the exchange of bogus gold yuan notes, distributing relief grain, eliminating stray soldiers and bandits, clearing garbage, crushing the baojia system, and assessing some taxes, and established contacts with the masses. The work has achieved great results. However, due to the fact that we mechanically transported a set of rural areas in the organizational form of urban power at that time, establishing street governments under the districts, and treating the district and street governments as a level of urban power, the daily work resulted in "multiple directives" and "disorderly steps", which had a very bad impact. This error was corrected after Comrade Shaoqi pointed it out. The following are specific provisions:

　　First: Cancel the street government, cancel the police substations, transform and strengthen the police stations.

　　The police organization under the reactionary regime is the deadly enemy of the people. The public security organization under the people's regime is the guard of the masses of the people, that is, one of the important weapons for the people's government to manage the city and realize the people's democratic rule. After we have smashed the old police system, we must establish a new people's public security system and work. At present, we should continue to thoroughly transform the police stations. The government should send a large number of capable cadres and revolutionary workers and students to the police stations, and absorb those elements in the old police who have been transformed and can faithfully serve the people to improve the police stations. Only in this way can the Public Security Bureau closely contact the masses, rely on the masses to implement the people's democratic rule, and effectively protect the safety of the people's lives and property. At the same time, the substations under the Public Security Branch Bureau should be abolished immediately, and the police stations should be directly led by the Public Security Branch Bureau. This will not only speed up the work but also bring the leading organs of the Public Security Bureau closer to the masses.

　　The task of the police station itself is to maintain the laws and decrees of the People's Government and protect the safety of the people's lives and property. Its specific tasks are as follows:

　　1. Eliminate enemy agents and other counter-revolutionary elements.
　　2. Eliminate bandits and other elements that disrupt public security.
　　3. Manage traffic order, manage fire protection and hygiene.
　　4. Handle violations of police regulations and accept disputes requested by the masses for mediation.
　　5. Investigate household registration and manage household affairs.
　　6. Protect public buildings and ban illegal buildings.
　　7. Assist in directing air defense.
　　8. Conduct social surveys and reflect social conditions.

　　After the street government is abolished, the work originally carried out by the street governments, such as local tax collection, organizing production, issuing loans, and social education, shall be handled separately by the competent departments of the municipal government, such as the Finance Bureau, the General Cooperative, the Bank, and the Education Bureau. Other matters such as preferential treatment, relief, dispute mediation, and some social education work shall be carried out by the district offices under the centralized leadership of the municipal level.

　　Regarding matters of a civil affairs nature, the district office may instruct the Public Security Branch Bureau to assist in the implementation through the police station; however, matters of a public security nature should be carried out independently by the public security system.

　　Second: The district government is changed to a district office.

　　All district governments should be uniformly changed to district offices (referred to as the No. ○ District Office of the Peiping Municipal People's Government) and their establishments should be streamlined. The district office is a dispatched organ of the municipal government and is responsible to the municipal government. In addition to carrying out the work assigned by the municipal government and handling some civil affairs, it should also be responsible for reporting situations, discovering problems, and providing opinions to the municipal government as the basis for the municipal government to decide and promote policies.

　　The specific tasks of the district office are as follows:

　　1. Handle preferential treatment, relief, marriage registration and other civil affairs work.
　　2. General civil dispute mediation work.
　　3. Industrial and commercial administrative work entrusted by the municipal government.
　　4. Social education work for some citizens, vendors, and casual laborers.

　　All departments of the municipal government should immediately improve the existing ones and establish some necessary institutions in order to centrally manage the various tasks that were previously carried out in a decentralized manner by the districts and streets and should be the responsibility of the municipal government in the future.

### 北平市军事管制委员会  关于改革区街政权组织及公安局派出所的决定

　　北平市军事管制委员会
    关于改革区街政权组织及公安局派出所的决定
    ——一九四九年六月三十日——
    现代城市的重要特点之一是集中，人口集中，政治、经济、文化亦集中，各种交通极为便利，而主要群众，又是集中的工人阶级。这与人口分散、经济分散、交通不便，而主要群众是个体的、分散的农民阶级的乡村，是根本不同的。因此城市的各种组织形式与工作形式，亦应不同。
    在乡村中，乡（村）的政权和群众组织（如农、青、妇）都是基础的一级。在城市中，街一级的政权和群众组织根本就不应设立。区应设区公所，但也不应成为政权的一级。一切工作应尽量集中于市一级来进行，否则就会把应该由市政府（或市工会等）集中统一决定和进行的工作，错误地加以分割，造成在工作中很混乱的现象。
    其次，在乡村中，因为村庄人口分散，交通又极不便，故县以上领导机关的工作，往往不得采用一些间接方式。反之，在城市中，市一级党、政、军、民的领导机关，却不但可以而且应该尽可能地采用直接的工作方式，例如随时都可召集有关人员当面商讨交待，或利用电话、报纸、广播等来进行各项工作，这样既迅速又准确。反之，如果把乡村一套工作方式机械地搬来，实际上往往很容易形成工作效率迟缓，及错误百出的现象。
    在我们入城之初，因为和平接管的北平，社会情况复杂，匪特与流散军人事前已有计划的潜伏，工人阶级绝大部分尚无组织，庞大的旧警察机构和人员尚来不及改造，各区都以少数老干部和大批工人、学生积极分子组织工作组，派遣到各保工作，负责调查和了解了城市一些情况，宣传了党与政府的政策，反映了一些市民的要求，负责进行了兑换伪金圆券、发救济粮、肃清散兵游勇、清除垃圾、粉碎保甲制、评定若干税收等项工作，与群众建立了联系，工作是有很大成绩的。但由于当时我们在城市政权的组织形式上，机械地搬运了乡村中的一套，在区下建立街政权，并将区街政权，当作城市政权的一级，以致在日常工作中“政出多门”，“步调紊乱”，影响极坏。这一错误，经少奇同志指出后，我们才加以改正。兹再作具体规定如下：
    第一：取消街政权，取消警察分驻所，改造和加强派出所。
    反动政权系统下的警察组织，是人民的死敌。人民政权系统下的公安组织，乃是人民大众的警卫员，亦即人民政府管理城市，实现人民民主统治的重要的武器之一。我们在粉碎了旧的警察制度之后，必须建立新的人民公安系统和工作。目前应该继续彻底改造派出所，政府应派大批的得力干部与革命的工人和学生到派出所里去，并吸收旧警察中经过改造可以忠实为人民服务的分子，健全派出所。只有这样，公安局才能密切联系群众，依靠群众来实行人民民主的统治，并有效地保卫人民生命财产的安全。同时公安分局下的分驻所，应即取消，由公安分局直接领导派出所，这样不但可以使工作迅速，而且可以使公安局的领导机关更加接近群众。
    派出所本身的任务，是维护人民政府法令，保护人民生命财产的安全，其具体工作如下：
    １、肃清敌特及其他反革命分子。
    ２、清除盗匪及其他破坏治安分子。
    ３、管理交通秩序，管理消防、卫生。
    ４、处理违警事件，并受理群众要求调解之纠纷。
    ５、调查户口，管理户政。
    ６、保护公共建筑物及取缔违章建筑物。
    ７、协助指挥防空。
    ８、进行社会调查，反映社会情况。
    街政府取消后，其原由各街政府所进行之工作，如地方税收、组织生产、发放贷款、社会教育等，均分别由市府之主管部门，如财政局、合作总社、银行、教育局等分别负责办理。其他优抚、救济、纠纷调解及一部分社会教育工作，则在市级的集中领导下，由各区公所执行之。
    关于民政性质之事项，区公所得经由公安分局指挥派出所协助执行之；但关于公安性质之事项，应由公安系统单独进行之。
    第二：区政府改为区公所。
    各区政府应即一律改为区公所（称为北平市人民政府第○区公所），并紧缩其编制。区公所为市政府之派出机关，向市政府负责，除执行市政府交办之工作，和办理一部分民政事务外，并应经常负责向市政府反映情况、发现问题、提供意见，作为市政府决定和推行政策之依据。
    区公所的具体工作如下：
    １、办理优抚、救济、婚姻登记及其他民政工作。
    ２、一般民事纠纷调解工作。
    ３、市政府所委托之工商行政工作。
    ４、一部分市民、小贩及零散劳动者之社会教育工作。
    市政府各部门，应即健全已有的并增设一些必要的机构，以便集中地管理过去由各区街分散进行而今后应由市政府负责进行的各种工作。
