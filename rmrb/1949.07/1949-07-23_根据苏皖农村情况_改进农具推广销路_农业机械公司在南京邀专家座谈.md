Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 22nd: To promote urban-rural cooperation, the China Agricultural Machinery Company invited agricultural experts and engineers from Nanjing to a symposium on agricultural tool improvement on the 19th. The meeting specifically discussed what to produce and how to market the products. Nine engineers and experts from the Agricultural Extension Committee, Jinling University Agricultural Engineering Group, Central Agricultural Tool Experiment Station, Central University Agricultural Engineering Department, and Mechanical Engineering Department attended. Gu Yuhua, the head of the Agricultural Section of the Subei Administrative Office, who came to Nanjing to learn about agricultural tool manufacturing, also participated. Attendees believed that, based on the specific conditions of the rural areas of Jiangsu and Anhui, the first priority should be to focus on manufacturing the agricultural tools that farmers need most, such as sickles, hoes, rakes, and shovels. At the same time, seeders, cultivators, and other tools should also be produced appropriately. The discussion pointed out the issues that should be noted when producing agricultural tools: First, cultivators and seeders must be manufactured as a set, because cultivators can only be used on land where seeders have been used. Second, when manufacturing the same type of agricultural tool, attention should be paid to the usage habits of farmers in different regions, and different styles should be adopted to expand sales. Regarding marketing issues, attendees believed that the following methods could be used: (1) Mobilize farmers to cooperate in purchasing intermediate-level agricultural tools, such as seeders and cultivators. (2) Use replaceable, low-priced raw materials (such as scrap iron and old tires, but they must be sturdy), reduce the number of components, and minimize costs as much as possible to be affordable for farmers. (3) Consult with the People's Bank to provide loans to the company for placing orders, and then use government agencies to lend the agricultural tools to farmers in kind. (4) Establish agricultural tool repair shops in various places as much as possible so that farmers can repair them at any time, so as not to affect farmers' confidence in using new agricultural tools.

　　根据苏皖农村情况
    改进农具推广销路
  　农业机械公司在南京邀专家座谈
    【新华社南京二十二日电】中国农业机械公司为促进城乡互助，于十九日邀请南京市农业专家、工程师举行农具改进座谈会，专门讨论生产什么和如何推销等问题。到会有农业推广委员会、金陵大学农工组、中央农具试验所、中央大学农业工程系及机械系的工程师、专家九人。日前来南京了解农具制造情况的苏北行政公署农业科长顾毓华亦参加。与会者根据目前苏皖农村的具体情况，认为首先应集中制造农民所最需要的农具如镰刀、锄头、钉钯、铁锹等。同时也适当地生产播种机、中耕机等。讨论时指出生产农具时应注意的问题，一是中耕机与播种机必需同时制造一套，因中耕机的使用必须是在使用播种机的地亩上。二是在制造同一种农具时应照顾各地农民的使用习惯采取不同式样，以广销路。关于推销问题，与会者认为有以下方法：（一）动员农民合作购买中级农具，如播种机、中耕机等。（二）使用能代替的低价原料（如废铁、旧车胎等，但须坚固），缩减机构，尽量减低成本，合乎农民的购买力。（三）商请人民银行向该公司贷款定货，再通过政府机关将农具折实贷给农民。（四）各地尽可能设立农具修理厂，使农民随时得以修理，不致影响农民使用新式农具的信心。
