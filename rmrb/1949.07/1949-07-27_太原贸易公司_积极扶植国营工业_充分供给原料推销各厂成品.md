　　Taiyuan Trading Company
　　Actively Supports State-Owned Industry
　　Fully Supplies Raw Materials and Promotes Finished Products from Various Factories
    [Taiyuan Electricity] The Taiyuan City Trading Company actively supports the production of state-owned industries. In May and June, it supplied the following raw materials to flour mills, cigarette factories, and other factories: over 4,639,000 catties of wheat, 219,311 catties of cotton, 250,000 catties of sorghum, 45,077 catties of hemp skin, 184,040 catties of tobacco leaves, 4,452 catties of hemp seed oil, 27,244 catties of hemp seeds, and 6,638 catties of palm skin. In order to ensure the livelihood of workers, the trading company distributed over 3,900,000 catties of various grains, over 71,000 catties of oil, and over 43,000 catties of salt to employees. It also helped various state-owned factories sell 9,250 bolts of foreign cloth, 1,400 boxes of matches, 6,000 bars of soap, 10.7 tons of caustic soda, 9,318 dozens of knitwear, 1,000 yards of wool gabardine, 1,000 blankets, 400 kilograms of foreign needles, 5 tons of bleaching powder, and 500 tons of foreign cement. Although the above achievements have been made, the following problems still exist between the trading company and state-owned industry in terms of production and sales: 1. The quality of raw materials (such as cotton) supplied by the trading company to state-owned industry is low and not suitable. 2. The cost of certain finished products of state-owned industry is high (such as bleaching powder), making it impossible for the trading company to promote them. 3. There is insufficient business contact between the trading company and state-owned industry. For example, the department store of the trading company does not dare to boldly sell knitwear for fear that the manufacturing plant cannot produce it; and the manufacturing plant does not dare to expand production for fear that it cannot be sold. In order to solve the above problems, the municipal government held a meeting on the 6th of this month. After discussion, the trading company is now negotiating contracts with state-owned factories in order to more effectively develop industrial production.

　　太原贸易公司
  　积极扶植国营工业
  　充分供给原料推销各厂成品
    【太原电】太原市贸易公司积极扶助国营工业生产。五、六月份供给了面粉厂、卷烟等厂原料计有：小麦四百六十三万九千余斤，棉花二十一万九千三百一十一斤，高粱二十五万斤，麻皮四万五千零七十七斤，烟叶十八万四千零四十斤，大麻籽油四千四百五十二斤，大麻籽二万七千二百四十四斤，棕皮六千六百三十八斤。为了保障工人生活，贸易公司向职工配售了各种粮食三百九十余万斤，油七万一千余斤、盐四万三千余斤，并帮助各国营工厂推销了洋布九千二百五十匹，火柴一千四百箱，肥皂六千条，火碱十点七吨，针织品九千三百一十八打，毛哔叽一千码，毛毯一千条，洋针四百公斤，漂粉五吨，洋灰五百吨。虽已获得以上成绩；但目前贸易公司与国营工业在产销上还存有以下问题：一、贸易公司供给国营工业的原料（如棉花）质量低，不适用。二、国营工业某些成品成本高（如漂粉），致使贸易公司无法推销。三、贸易公司与国营工业间业务联系不够，如贸易公司百货部不敢大胆出售针织品，是怕制造厂做不出来；而制造厂则不敢扩大生产，怕卖不出去。为解决上述问题，市政府曾于本月六日召开会议，经研讨后，现贸易公司正与国营工厂商订合同，以便工业生产更有效的发展。
