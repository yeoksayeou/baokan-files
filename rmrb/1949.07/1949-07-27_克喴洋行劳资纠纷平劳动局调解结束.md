　　【Our Newspaper】The 平 (Ping) City People's Government Labor Bureau, based on the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, resolved the labor dispute at the 克喴 洋行 (Ke Wei Foreign Firm) on the 12th of this month and signed a mediation agreement on the 13th. Mrs. 克雷曼 (Keleiman), the capitalist of 克喴 洋行 (Ke Wei Foreign Firm), is French and opened 克喴 洋行 (Ke Wei Foreign Firm) in 东交民苍 (Dongjiaominxiang), 平 (Ping) City, engaging in jewelry and watch business. After the North China Government announced the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Gold and Silver in the North China Region," the government ordered the foreign firm to switch from the jewelry business. The capitalist used this as an excuse to immediately dismiss eight workers, including 王锦初 (Wang Jinchu), on May 31st of this year, forcing them to leave the firm on the same day and refusing to pay severance. After two negotiations between the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the capitalist, the capitalist only agreed to pay each person one month's salary and refused to explain the name of this expense. At the end of last month, the workers submitted this dispute to the Municipal Labor Bureau for handling. After accepting the request, the bureau first understood the situation from the three aspects of labor and capital and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and summoned Mrs. 克雷曼 (Keleiman) to the bureau to prepare for mediation. At this time, the capitalist realized that she was unreasonable and privately reached an agreement with the workers: three people were retained, except for 王锦初 (Wang Jinchu), and four people were dismissed with severance pay. 王锦初 (Wang Jinchu) insisted on asking the government to mediate, so the bureau officially summoned 王锦初 (Wang Jinchu) and the capitalist for mediation on the 11th and 12th of this month, and signed a mediation agreement on the 13th. The main contents are: (1) According to the general situation of dismissing workers in Peiping, the capitalist shall appropriately pay 王锦初 (Wang Jinchu) severance pay, calculated at half a month's salary for each year of work. (2) The capitalist notified the workers on May 31st, ordering them to leave their jobs immediately without prior notice one month in advance, so another half month's salary should be paid to compensate the workers for the loss of sudden unemployment. (3) In the future, if 克喴 洋行 (Ke Wei Foreign Firm) needs to add workers due to production needs, 王锦初 (Wang Jinchu) and the five dismissed workers have the priority to obtain the job. The dispute at 克喴 洋行 (Ke Wei Foreign Firm) has come to an end.

　　克喴洋行劳资纠纷平劳动局调解结束
    【本报讯】平市人民政府劳动局本着发展生产、劳资两利的政策，已经在本月十二日解决了克喴洋行劳资纠纷事件；并于十三日签订调解书。克喴洋行资方克雷曼夫人，系法兰西人，在平市东交民苍开办克喴洋行，经营首饰兼钟表业，自华北政府公布“华北区金银管理暂行办法”后，政府曾令该洋行首饰业转业，资方即以此为借口，在本年五月三十一日将工人王锦初等八人立刻解雇；当日迫令离行，并拒绝发给遣散费。经市总工会两次与资方协商，资方仅允发给每人一个月的工资，并拒绝说明此项费用的名称。工人们遂在上月底将此纠纷呈请市劳动局处理。该局于接受请求后，首先从劳资双方和市总工会三方面了解情况并传克雷曼夫人到局准备调解，在这时资方自觉无理，即私下与工人成立协议，除工人王锦初外，三人留用，四人发遣散费解雇。工人王锦初坚持要求政府调解，该局乃在本月十一、十二两天，召集王锦初和资方正式进行调解，遂于十三日签订调解书，主要内容：（一）根据北平解雇工人的一般情况，由资方适当的发给王锦初遣散费，以每工作一年，发给半个月工资计算。（二）资方在五月三十一日通知劳方，令其立刻离职，并未在一月前预先通知，所以应另外发给半个月的工资，以赔偿工人遭到突然失业的损失。（三）今后克喴洋行如因生产需要增添工人时，王锦初及被遣散等五工人有获得该项工作的优先权。克喴洋行纠纷，已告一结束。
