　　Tianjin Imposes Industrial and Commercial Income Tax
　　Democratic Assessment of Scores to be Completed Mid-Month
    [Tianjin Electric] Tianjin City's industrial and commercial income tax for the second half of the thirty-seventh year [1948] commenced on the 5th. The total score for all industries in the city has been determined to be 200,000 points, with each point bearing a burden of 15,000 yuan, and it is stipulated that the collection work be completed before the 15th of this month. Beforehand, the People's Government had invited industrial and commercial circles to forums several times to solicit opinions widely. Finally, it was decided to adopt a method combining democratic appraisal and typical investigation for collection. The appraisal work began in early June. First, the Industrial Association and the Chamber of Commerce convened all industry guilds in the city to form a joint appraisal committee. Industrial and commercial representatives familiar with the situation of each industry were selected from the representatives of each industry to serve as appraisers, responsible for allocating the total burden score to each industry. The Tax Bureau, together with the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Trading Company, the People's Bank, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative and other relevant departments such as the Industrial Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Workers' Union, jointly formed an Industrial and Commercial Income Tax Collection Promotion Committee to assist and promote the collection work.
    After the appraisal of approximately 170 industries in the city was completed by the end of June, the Municipal Government, based on the actual situation of each industry last year and the current affordability, finally determined the tax rate for each point to be 15,000 yuan, and announced it simultaneously with the burden scores of each industry on July 5th. In addition, in order to reward industry, promote export trade and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, tax reduction methods were also stipulated. Twenty industries, including machine manufacturing, mining, chemical soap manufacturing, and export commerce, were separately granted tax reductions ranging from 10% to 40%.
