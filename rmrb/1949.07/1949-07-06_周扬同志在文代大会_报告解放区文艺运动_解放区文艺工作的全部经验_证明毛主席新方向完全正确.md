[Ping Shi News] The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers held its fourth day of meetings yesterday (the 5th). Li Bozhao chaired, and Zhou Yang made a speech on the literary and art movement in the liberated areas.

Zhou Yang began by saying that since Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, the face of literature and art in the liberated areas and the face of literary and art workers in the liberated areas have undergone fundamental changes in the past seven or eight years. The entire experience of literary and art work in the liberated areas has proven that Chairman Mao's new direction for literature and art is completely correct. The literature and art of the liberated areas has become truly new people's literature and art. National struggle, class struggle, and labor production have become the overriding themes in the works, and the worker-peasant-soldier masses have gained the status of true protagonists in the works, just as they have in society. Literary and art workers in the liberated areas have participated in the war, the land reform, and the production movement, and have undergone a great deal of training. In particular, many literary and art workers in the army directly participated in combat, conducting propaganda and singing on the front lines, and some shed their last drop of blood on the battlefield. The relationship between literature and art and the masses has also undergone fundamental changes, and literature and art has become an effective tool for mass education and cadre education. Zhou Yang pointed out that literary and art workers in the liberated areas have studied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, participated in various mass struggles and practical work, and have begun to study and experience the various policies of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the People's Government from the struggle and work. This is the most fundamental reason why the literature and art of the liberated areas has achieved healthy growth.

Zhou Yang used the content of many relatively successful works to illustrate how the Chinese people overcame difficulties and transformed themselves in various struggles against national oppression and feudal oppression. He said that after thirty years of struggle, the Chinese people have begun to break free from the spiritual shackles imposed on them by imperialism and feudalism, and have developed the inherent diligence, bravery, and all other excellent qualities of the Chinese nation. A new national character is being formed, and our works reflect and promote the growth of this new national character. In accordance with the new content in the works, there have also been many new creations in the form of the works. That is, the language in the works has reached a considerable degree of popularization, and has learned many things from folk forms. Literary and art workers should continue to learn from folk forms in the future, but this does not mean that they should exclude or belittle foreign forms. We should attach great importance to and humbly accept all the excellent and useful traditions in Chinese and foreign heritage, especially the experience of Soviet socialist literature.

In addition to the creative activities of professional literary and art workers, Zhou Yang also pointed out that the amateur literary and art activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the liberated areas have also achieved unprecedented development. In the People's Liberation Army, literature and art has become a powerful weapon of political work; in the countryside, yangko dances and yangko operas have become an indispensable part of the lives of the peasant masses; and in the newly liberated big cities, the amateur literary and art activities of workers have also achieved certain results and experience. These mass amateur literary and art activities have formed tens of millions of militia on the literary and art front, which supplements the deficiencies of professional literary and art activities, that is, the regular army on the literary and art front, and at the same time, it is the source and foundation of professional literary and art activities. Since they are militia, they must not be separated from production, so when guiding mass literary and art activities, the first principle must be that it does not hinder the production of workers and peasants.

New Literary and Art Workers Should Reflect Worker-Peasant Production

After giving a general account of the literature and art of the liberated areas since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, Zhou Yang went on to tell the literary and art workers of the liberated areas not to be complacent. He said that although we have made achievements, we have no reason to be complacent at all. Our literary and art work is still far behind the development of the revolutionary situation and the needs of the revolution. In the future, the process of building a new China will basically be the process of transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country, and literary and art workers should first reflect industrial and agricultural production and construction. Construction itself is also a struggle, so literary and art works should express the unity and struggle of the Chinese people in this production and construction. Secondly, more works should be produced that reflect the great revolutionary war. These works should not only write about the bravery of commanders and fighters, but also about their wisdom, their tactical thinking, and how Chairman Mao's military thinking is implemented in the people's army. He pointed out that the ideological content of our works is not high enough. All progressive literary and art workers must stand at the ideological level of the times, specifically, at the level of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can they gain the ability to independently observe, analyze, and synthesize various life phenomena, that is, the ability of artistic generalization. Only in this way can they unify the reflection of life and the propaganda of policies, so as not to distort the basic facts in life in order to promote individual specific policies, or to blur the basic policy ideas for the sake of the truth of local life. Only in this way can they more powerfully express positive characters, express the heroic models among the masses, and overcome the shortcomings of the past, where writing about positive characters was always not as good as writing about negative characters. Only in this way can they not only reflect the situation and problems among the masses, but also reflect the situation and problems in leadership. We need works that reflect and criticize the ideological style of revolutionary cadres, including leading cadres, and to write such works, we must have a higher ideological level ourselves, and at the same time, be familiar with the style, thinking, and personality of various leading cadres. He also pointed out that none of the works in the liberated areas has reached the level of formal perfection, so we must learn technology. But we must also oppose and prevent all technical supremacy and formalism, and we must establish a new aesthetic standard for people's literature and art. All forms that are "fresh, lively, and loved by the Chinese people, with a Chinese style and Chinese spirit" are beautiful, and vice versa.

In the Entire Literary and Art Movement, Popularization is Still the First Priority in the Future

In the entire literary and art movement, Zhou Yang explained that popularization is still the first priority in the future. This is not only because popularization work must first be done for the masses in the newly liberated areas, but also because the foundation of popularization work in the old liberated areas is not yet solid, especially since we have entered the cities, we must not forget the countryside. He quoted Chairman Mao's recent development of "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "The most serious problem is to educate the peasants," saying that in addition to using great efforts to carry out factory literary and art work, we must also use all the superior conditions of modern cities and transportation, adopt various methods, and continue to carry out popularization work for the peasants.

Regarding the reform of Peking Opera and other local operas, Zhou Yang pointed out that simple administrative orders cannot be adopted. The central key to reform is to provide enough usable new scripts. Therefore, it is necessary to organize a large number of old artists and some new literary and drama workers to create or modify them personally, and the People's Government and literary and art leading organs should provide guidance and necessary assistance. In reforming old operas, on the one hand, we must prevent impatience, and on the other hand, we must also oppose the erroneous conservative view that inappropriately emphasizes the artistic "integrity" of old operas and emphasizes the difficulty of mastering technology, and therefore does not dare to boldly break through the form of old operas.

Finally, he proposed establishing scientific literary and art criticism, strengthening the organization and leadership of literary and art work, and appropriately solving the difficulties and problems encountered by literary and art workers in practical work and in creation. He said that he believes that after this conference, the literature and art of the people of the new China will surely have greater development and will emit a great light in the history of Chinese literature and art.

[Also News] The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers has successively received congratulatory telegrams from all parties, unanimously emphasizing their willingness to work together under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. These include the North China Higher Education Committee, the Beiping Municipal Branch of the China Democratic League, Xinhua Bookstore and New China Bookstore, Reader Bookstore, Knowledge Bookstore, the Student Association of the National Conservatory of Music, and the Preparatory Committee of the First National Science Conference.

　　周扬同志在文代大会　报告解放区文艺运动
    解放区文艺工作的全部经验
  　证明毛主席新方向完全正确
    【平市讯】全国文学艺术工作者代表大会于昨日（五日）举行第四日的会议，李伯钊主席，周扬作关于解放区文艺运动的发言。
    周扬首称，自从毛主席在延安文艺界座谈会上讲话以来，最近七八年间，解放区的文艺的面貌和解放区的文艺工作者的面貌已经有了根本的改变，解放区文艺工作的全部经验证明了毛主席文艺新方向的完全正确。解放区的文艺已经成为真正新的人民的文艺。民族斗争、阶级斗争和劳动生产成了作品中压倒一切的主题，工农兵群众在作品中如在社会中一样取得了真正主人公的地位。解放区的文艺工作者参加了战争，参加了土地改革和生产运动，经过了不少的锻炼。特别是许多部队文艺工作者直接参加战斗，在火线上进行鼓动演唱，有的就在战场上流了最后一滴血。文艺与群众的关系也发生了根本变化，文艺已成为群众教育、干部教育的有效工具之一。周扬指出，解放区文艺工作者学习了马列主义毛泽东思想，参加了各种群众斗争和实际工作，并从斗争中和工作中开始学习了体验了中国共产党、中国人民解放军与人民政府的各项政策，这就是解放区文艺所以获得健康成长的最根本的原因。
    周扬就许多比较成功的作品的内容，说明它们反映了中国人民如何在反对民族压迫与封建压迫的各种斗争中，克服了困难，改造了自己。他说中国人民经过了三十年的斗争，已经开始挣脱了帝国主义封建主义加在他们身上的精神枷锁，发展了中国民族固有的勤劳英勇及其他一切优良品性，新的国民性正在形成之中；我们的作品就反映着并推进着新的国民性的成长的过程。和作品中的新的内容相适应的，作品的形式也有许多新的创造。这就是作品中的语言做到了相当大众化的程度，并从民间形式学习了许多东西。文艺工作者今后还要继续学习民间形式，但这并不等于就要排斥或轻视外来的形式。我们应该十分重视并虚心接受中外遗产中一切优良有用的传统，特别是苏联社会主义文学的经验。
    除了专业文艺工作者的创作活动而外，周扬还指出解放区工农兵自己业余的文艺活动也获得了空前的发展。在人民解放军里面，文艺成为政治工作的有力武器；在农村，秧歌舞秧歌剧已成为农民群众生活中不可缺少的部分；在新解放的大城市里面，工人业余的文艺活动也已取得了一定的成绩和经验。这些群众业余的文艺活动形成了文艺战线上的千万支民兵，它是补充专业文艺活动亦即文艺战线上的正规军之不足的，同时又是专业文艺活动的源泉和基础。既然是民兵，就必须不脱离生产，因此在指导群众文艺活动的时候，首先必须以不妨碍工农的生产为原则。
    新的文艺工作者　应反映工农生产
    周扬把延安文艺界座谈会以来的解放区文艺作了一个概略的叙述以后，接着就告诉解放区的文艺工作者不要自满。他说我们虽说有了成绩，但丝毫没有可以自满的理由，我们的文艺工作还远落在革命形势的发展与革命的需要后面。今后新中国的建设过程基本上就是变农业国为工业国的过程，文艺工作者首先应该反映工农业生产建设。建设本身也就是斗争，因此文艺作品要表现中国人民在这种生产建设中的团结和斗争。其次应该产生更多的反映伟大的革命战争的作品，这种作品不但要写出指战员的勇敢，而且要写出他们的智慧，他们的战术思想，要写出毛主席的军事思想如何在人民军队中贯彻。他指出我们的作品的思想性还不够高。一切前进的文艺工作者必须站在时代思想水平上，具体地说，就是站在马列主义毛泽东思想的水平上。只有这样，才能获得独立观察、分析与综合各种生活现象的能力，也就是艺术上的概括力。只有这样，才能把反映生活与宣传政策两者统一起来，不至于为了宣传个别具体政策而歪曲了生活中的基本事实，或者为了局部生活的真实而模糊了基本政策思想。只有这样才能更有力地表现积极人物，表现群众中的英雄模范，克服过去写积极人物总不如写消极人物写得好的缺点。只有这样才能不但反映群众中的情况和问题，而且反映领导上的情况和问题。我们需要反映与批评包括领导干部在内的革命干部的思想作风的作品，而要写出这种作品就必须自己有较高的思想水平，同时又熟悉各种领导干部的作风、思想和性格。他又指出，现在解放区所有的作品还没有达到形式上完美的程度，因此我们必须学习技术。但我们又必须反对与防止一切技术至上主义与形式主义，必须确立人民文艺的新的美学的标准，凡是“新鲜活泼的，为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风与中国气派”的形式，就是美的，反之就是丑的。
    在整个文艺运动中　今后仍是普及第一
    在整个文艺运动中，周扬说明今后仍然是普及第一。这不但是因为对新解放区的群众必须首先做普及工作，而且因为老解放区普及工作的基础也还不巩固，特别是我们进了城市，不要忘了农村。他引用毛主席最近发展的“论人民民主专政”中的话，“最严重的问题，是教育农民”，说除了必须用大力去进行工厂文艺工作而外，还必须利用有了现代城市和交通的一切优越条件，采用各种方法，继续对农民进行普及工作。
    对于改革平剧和其他地方戏，周扬指出不能简单采取行政命令的办法，改革的中心关键就是供给足够的可用的新的剧本。因此必须组织广大旧艺人和一些新的文学戏剧工作者亲自动手创作或修改，人民政府和文艺领导机关则应加以指导和必要的协助。在改革旧剧上，一方面要防止急燥态度，另一方面也要反对不适当地强调旧剧艺术上的“完整性”，强调掌握技术的困难，因而不敢大胆突破旧剧形式的那种错误的保守观点。
    最后他提出建立科学的文艺批评，加强文艺工作的组织领导，适当地解决文艺工作者在实际工作中及在创作中的碰到的困难和问题。他说他相信在这次大会以后，新中国人民的文艺必将有更大的开展，在中国文艺历史上将放出万丈光芒来。
    【又讯】全国文代会陆续收到各方贺电，一致强调愿在中国共产党领导下共同努力。其中包括华北高等教育委员会、中国民主同盟北平市支部、新华书店与新中国书局、读者书店、知识书店、国立音乐院同学会及中华全国第一次科学会议筹备会。
