[Ping City News] The Beiping Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army yesterday issued a proclamation regarding the registration of personnel from reactionary parties. The full text is as follows:

	The Pingjin Garrison Headquarters, upon entering the city, issued Proclamation Wei Zi No. 1, announcing the dissolution of the Kuomintang of China, the Three People's Principles Youth League, the China Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and other counter-revolutionary organizations that were affiliated with or reactionary to the enemy, sealing off their offices, and strictly prohibiting their activities. However, recent investigations have revealed that many personnel from reactionary parties continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. In order to safeguard the interests of the people and consolidate the revolutionary order, and to resolutely implement the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters' policy of thoroughly eliminating such reactionary parties, the Commission hereby stipulates the following specific implementation measures for the registration of personnel from reactionary parties:

	1.  All public property, public goods, and archives of the Kuomintang of China, the Three People's Principles Youth League, the China Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and all other affiliated reactionary parties shall be confiscated and turned over to the public, in addition to the dissolution of their organizations, the sealing of their offices, and the strict prohibition of their activities.

	2.  All personnel who are at or above the level of District Branch Committee Member in the Kuomintang of China, Squadron Leader in the Three People's Principles Youth League, District Branch Committee Member in the China Youth Party, District Branch Committee Member in the Democratic Socialist Party, or equivalent to the above ranks, shall, from the date of this proclamation, immediately apply for registration at the local Public Security Sub-bureau with their personal National Identity Card, household registration certificate, and three two-inch bareheaded photographs, and hand over all remaining certificates, documents, membership lists of party members, archives, weapons, radios, codes, and various public properties and goods. No further delay will be tolerated.

	3.  All the aforementioned individuals who are still in factories, schools, railways, mines, cultural organizations, public enterprises, and various departments of government institutions shall register with the designated registration department where they are located.

	4.  Those who obey the order to register, sincerely repent, and surrender weapons, radios, documents, archives, and all certificates, evidence, and all documents and forms will be treated leniently. Those who voluntarily report other reactionary secret organizations and lurking elements with factual evidence and assist the government in successfully uncovering enemy agents will be given exemption from punishment or rewards as appropriate, depending on the size of their contribution. Those who fail to apply for registration, attempt to conceal or resist, or engage in acts of sabotaging the registration, or conceal and destroy weapons, radios, and important certificates and documents during registration will be severely punished according to the law once discovered.

	5.  Those who carry out false registration, attempting to deceive, or continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after completing the registration procedures will be severely punished.

	6.  All our citizens, in addition to urging the aforementioned reactionary party members to register with the government's public security organs, should actively and promptly report those who are found to be concealing, resisting, or engaging in destructive activities. Those who report meritorious service will be rewarded, and those who conceal and harbor them will be punished.

	All of the above must be strictly observed and implemented. This proclamation is hereby issued.
