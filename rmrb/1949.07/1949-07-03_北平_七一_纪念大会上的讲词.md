Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 2nd. The full text of Commander-in-Chief Zhu's speech at the Beiping "July 1st" 28th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting is as follows:
    Comrades!
    Today, we are all very excited to celebrate the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Party. Over the past 28 years, our Party has gone through the Great Revolution, the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War, and today has finally achieved the basic victory of the Chinese revolution. Nanjing, the old nest of the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary rule, and Shanghai, the largest city in East Asia, have been liberated, as have Wuhan, Hangzhou, Nanchang, and Xi'an. The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has been declared extinct. The People's Liberation Army is continuing to advance, and soon the banner of victory will be planted all over China. The new Political Consultative Conference has already begun its preparatory work, and soon the New Democratic People's Republic and its central government will be proclaimed. A new page in China's five-thousand-year history will soon officially begin. This is the great victory of the Chinese people, the great victory of the Chinese Communist Party, and the great victory of Chairman Mao's leadership.
    Today, as we celebrate the 28th anniversary of the Party, we must recognize that this victory is the victory of Marxism-Leninism and the victory of proletarian internationalism. After the Opium War, the Chinese nation, in the extremely painful life caused by imperialist aggression and feudal oppression, had waged many heroic struggles. Many heroes and martyrs demonstrated admirable and moving spirits, but these struggles all failed. Only after the October Revolution, when Marxism-Leninism was introduced to China and the Chinese Communist Party was born, did the outstanding representatives of the Chinese people learn step by step to act in accordance with Marxism-Leninism. From that moment on, the face of the Chinese revolution took on a new look, and the Chinese people's struggle moved step by step towards final victory. Therefore, we say that the historic victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the thought of Marxism-Leninism. Only Marxism-Leninism illuminated the path of the Chinese people's struggle. Without this thought, the victory of the Chinese people would have been impossible. Secondly, we must also know that the victory of the Chinese people is inseparable from the revolutionary struggle of the world's proletariat. In the past, China was the target of aggression by all imperialist countries in the world. These imperialist countries maintained political, economic, and cultural aggressive forces in China for a long time. These forces weighed heavily on the Chinese people, making it difficult for them to breathe. This aggressive force was the supporter and backstage boss of all domestic reactionaries in China. To expel this aggressive force and consolidate our own victory, it is impossible to rely solely on the Chinese people themselves. In fact, with the existence of the Soviet Union and its increasing strength, with the victory of the anti-fascist Second World War, eliminating the fascism of Germany, Italy, and Japan, with the establishment of many new democratic countries in Eastern Europe, with the anti-imperialist struggles of oppressed nations around the world, and the revolutionary struggles of the working class and the masses in capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, and Germany, the Chinese people had their own friends in the anti-imperialist struggle, had allies fighting together, and were able to achieve today's glorious victory.
    As we commemorate the 28th anniversary of the Party's founding, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism throughout the Party, strengthen internationalist education within the Party, and raise the ideological level of Marxism-Leninism throughout the Party, so as to further Bolshevize our Party.
    Comrades, the Chinese revolution has basically triumphed, but as Chairman Mao has instructed us, overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is only the first step in a ten-thousand-mile long march. Greater, more arduous, and more complex tasks lie ahead. We should not be complacent in any way. We must continue to maintain the style of humility, prudence, lack of pride, lack of impatience, and hard struggle. We should transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country in the great economic construction. Only when our industry is developed and we are economically independent of foreign countries will our national independence and autonomy have a foundation, and only then will the happiness of our people be guaranteed. Therefore, economic construction has become the central task that overrides everything after the victory of the whole country. In order to do a good job in economic construction, two things must be done well. First, it is necessary to implement the four-way policy of public-private partnership, labor-capital benefit, urban-rural mutual assistance, and internal and external exchanges, as instructed by Chairman Mao. This is the only correct guideline for our economic construction. We have only three enemies, namely imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. At the same time, our revolutionary camp is led by the working class and the Communist Party, based on workers and peasants, and united with the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. We must draw a clear line between enemies and friends. This is closely related to the implementation of the four-way policy. Second, it is necessary to call on the whole Party to earnestly and diligently learn to do economic work. Communists have a great strength, that is, they are good at learning. Everything that one does not know can be learned, and doing economic work can also be learned. We should learn from the advanced Soviet Union, but also learn from our enemies, and learn from all people. Imperialists say that we cannot do economic work, we must prove to the world that the Chinese Communists are not only good at running revolutions, but also good at running construction.
    As we commemorate the 28th anniversary of the Party's founding, we must particularly recognize the importance of economic construction, study and implement Chairman Mao's four-way policy, learn to open factories, open farms, open stores, run cooperatives, build railways, run banks, and learn to build our New Democratic economy well.
    The achievements of our Party's 28 years of struggle have only paved the foundation for the construction of a new society on this land of China. In the future, we will build a magnificent, splendid, New Democratic building on this foundation. Marxist-Leninist theory has guaranteed our Party's successive victories over the past 28 years. In the future, under the illumination of Marxist-Leninist thought, our Party will lead the people of the whole country through New Democratic construction, advancing towards socialism and communism.

  The Speech of Comrade Bo Yibo
    Xinhua News Agency. The full text of Bo Yibo's speech at the Beiping "July 1st" 28th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting is as follows:
    Comrades:
    Today is the 28th anniversary of the birth of our Chinese Communist Party. This is one of the most important anniversaries of our Party, and also one of the most important anniversaries of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. The birth of the Chinese Communist Party is the most important event in Chinese history. Since the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the face of China has been completely renewed, and Chinese history has entered a new period. From then on, the development of Chinese history cannot be separated from the Communist Party. The victory and failure of the Chinese Communist Party represent the victory and failure of the Chinese people. The advancement and retreat of the Chinese Communist Party also mark the advancement and retreat of Chinese history. The Chinese Communist Party has become an indispensable factor in the political life of the Chinese people, and has become the backbone and soul of the Chinese people. This is undeniable. Therefore, anyone who does not understand the history of the Chinese Communist Party cannot understand modern Chinese history; anyone who does not understand the line and policies of the Chinese Communist Party cannot consciously participate in the creation and construction of the new China.
    The Chinese Communist Party has passed a full twenty-eight years from its birth to today. Over the past twenty-eight years, our Party has experienced extremely tortuous roads, from groups to base areas to the whole country. Today, we have basically defeated the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and the final victory in the whole country is not far away.
    Since its founding, the Chinese Communist Party has plunged into the Great Revolution and into actual struggle, and has not stopped until now. It has been fighting every day, bloody and bloodless, open and secret, legal and illegal, as well as struggles in various aspects, political, military, mass, and united front, and has won the great victory of the Chinese revolution, and also made our Party get a lot of training. Our Party has become a Bolshevik party. The Chinese revolution has won such a great victory, which is inseparable from the correct leadership of Chairman Mao. During the First Great Revolution, Chairman Mao was correct, but at the end of the Great Revolution, Chairman Mao's correct guiding line, such as the Report on the Investigation of the Hunan Peasant Movement, was rejected by the leadership of the opportunists at that time, thus causing the Great Revolution to fail. After the failure of the Great Revolution, even in the Jinggangshan period in 1928, Chairman Mao stipulated the correct political, military, and organizational lines under the new conditions, so that the subsequent Red Army war was able to develop rapidly. But this line also went through a tortuous period before it was unanimously recognized and accepted by the whole Party. The process of the development of Mao Zedong Thought in the Party is also the process of the victory of the Chinese revolution.
    Twenty-eight years of history have proved that the development of modern Chinese history cannot be separated from the Communist Party, and the development of the Communist Party cannot be separated from Chairman Mao.
    Our Party has accumulated such rich revolutionary experience through such a tortuous road, thus training our Party to become a truly indestructible and invincible party, and has become a party that is not only daring but also able to victoriously and happily lead the Chinese revolution to the final victory.

  The Speech of Comrade Peng Zhen
    Xinhua News Agency. The full text of Peng Zhen's speech at the Beiping "July 1st" 28th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting is as follows:
    Fellow Comrades! Distinguished Guests:
    After twenty-eight years of arduous struggle, we have led the Chinese people to "achieve basic victory." In a large country with a population of 475 million, the people's achievement of such a victory is a major event affecting the overall situation of the world. We should celebrate our victory, celebrate that the degree of awareness and organizational strength of our Chinese people is sufficient to defeat imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    But without the assistance of international revolutionary forces, especially the socialist Soviet Union, and without the wise and experienced leadership given to us by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of our Party headed by Chairman Mao, we could not have achieved such a victory today. Therefore, when we celebrate our victory, we should also thank the international revolutionary forces, especially the assistance of the Soviet Union, and rejoice that we have such wise leadership from Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of our Party.
    Comrades! Now that we have achieved basic victory, we must not be proud, we must not be complacent, and we must not be slack. "We have many things to do." Chairman Mao instructed us: "For example, walking, the past work is only like finishing the first step of the Long March. The remaining enemies still need to be completely eliminated by us; serious economic construction tasks are in front of us." To say farther, we must go through "the People's Democratic Republic, to socialism and communism, to the elimination of classes and the great harmony of the world." We must make persistent efforts, carry forward our achievements, correct shortcomings and mistakes, and constantly do our work better.
    When the comrades in Beiping are commemorating "July 1st," what else should they pay attention to besides conscientiously following the instructions given to us by Chairman Mao in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Comrade Dong Biwu in their speeches at the conference, and carrying out their own work? We believe that:
    First, we must adhere to the style of hard work and simplicity, and not be like "Li Zicheng entering Beijing," swallowed up by hedonistic corruption and old forces.
    Does our insistence on the style of hard work mean that we are "ascetics"? No! It is only because our productivity is still very undeveloped, and production has not been well restored and developed, so the lives of our commanders and fighters, our own class—the working class and the broad masses of peasants—are still very difficult, so we must still adhere to the style of hard work. When productivity develops in the future, and the lives of the working people are improved, we Communists, that is, the people's servants, can of course improve our own lives like the working people. We are different from the Kuomintang reactionaries, we must share weal and woe with the working people.
    Second, we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class. How to rely on the working class? Only by strengthening the political education of the working class, raising their political awareness, and guaranteeing the material life of the workers can the entire working masses be more closely integrated with us and become the most reliable pillar of all work. The so-called guaranteeing the material life of the workers must be regarded as second only to the lives of the commanders and fighters, and at least should be given the same attention as the lives of the staff of the organs. But the so-called relying on the working class is not to kick away the other classes that should be united; guaranteeing the material life of the workers should also not affect the restoration and development of production. On the contrary, we must implement the instructions given to us by Chairman Mao to distinguish between enemies and friends, that is, "three enemies, four friends" and "all directions."
    Third, we must closely care about the interests of the peasants and the lives of the peasants. The worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of the People's Democratic Republic. The peasants have exerted the greatest effort and made the greatest sacrifices in the People's Liberation War. Without the solid cooperation of workers and peasants, there would be no victory of the People's Revolution and no solid People's Democratic Republic. To consolidate this cooperation, in addition to educating the peasants, leading the peasants, and developing rural production, in the cities, we must properly restore, improve, and develop our production and supply the peasants with a large number of high-quality and inexpensive industrial products—some means of production and consumer goods that they must have. Production is our current overriding central task, but precisely in this regard, we lack experience and know very little. We must humbly learn to do economic work, learn the democratic management of factories, learn to master technology, especially learn to guide the entire national economy in accordance with Chairman Mao's "all directions" policy, otherwise it is impossible to restore and develop production at the fastest speed, transform the agricultural country into an industrial country, and effectively improve the lives of the peasants and even all the people.
    Finally, we call on comrades to earnestly study the Marxist-Leninist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods of observing and handling problems, use Marxist-Leninist theory, use Mao Zedong Thought, the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, to arm our minds, and strive to be good students of Stalin and Mao Zedong.

  The Speech of Mr. Shen Junru
    Xinhua News Agency. The full text of Shen Junru's speech at the Beiping "July 1st" 28th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting is as follows:
    Today is the birthday of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party was born on July 1, 1921, and it has been a full twenty-eight years.
    During these twenty-eight years, the Chinese people launched the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal Great Revolution, eliminated the Northern Warlords who colluded with imperialism, defeated the armed invasion of Japanese fascism, and overthrew the feudal rule of the landlord class. In the past three years, the Chinese People's Liberation War has also achieved unprecedented victories, and has basically eliminated the Kuomintang reactionary government under the wings of American imperialism. The final and comprehensive victory of the Chinese People's Revolution is just around the corner.
    During these twenty-eight years, the people created their own army—the Chinese People's Liberation Army; the people created their own culture—the new revolutionary culture; and the Chinese people are now building their own country—the People's Democratic Republic.
    Before twenty-eight years, there were many revolutions in China, and there were constant political, economic, and cultural struggles. But the people never got a real victory, and the Chinese revolution never got such a thorough victory as it is today.
    The reason is very simple: there was no Chinese Communist Party before twenty-eight years. There was a Chinese Communist Party only twenty-eight years ago.
    Chairman Mao's memorial essay published today correctly points out: "The people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party) based on the worker-peasant alliance—this is our formula, this is our main experience, this is our main program."
    Today, all the Chinese people, including the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie, should adopt this formula, should accept this experience, and should obey this program. It indicates the bright future of our country and people, and it also indicates the current domestic and foreign policies that the country and people should adopt: internally, we must implement the people's democratic dictatorship; externally, we must unite with the nations and peoples of all countries in the world who treat me equally and struggle together!
    Fellow countrymen of China! People of all democratic parties and all revolutionary classes! Let us use actions to celebrate the birthday of the Chinese Communist Party. The people of the whole country must always be close to the Chinese Communist Party and learn from the Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader Mao Zedong. We must "lean to one side." We must distinguish between enemies and friends. We are not afraid to stimulate the enemy, but we will never abandon our friends. Let us unite as one and quickly build a new country under the people's democratic dictatorship. "Unite as one," the Chinese people are willing to offer these four words to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong as a birthday gift.

  The Speech of Mr. Guo Moruo
    Xinhua News Agency. The full text of Guo Moruo's speech at the Beiping "July 1st" 28th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting is as follows:
    Dear friends: Today is the twenty-eighth birthday of the Chinese Communist Party, which should be a great National Day for all the Chinese people. The people of the whole country should express the warmest congratulations with full enthusiasm.
    Now almost the whole of China is filled with such a song: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no China." That's right, if China did not have the Chinese Communist Party, China would have been lost to a group of traitors long ago.
    But today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has won a decisive victory, and the people of the whole of China are about to be completely and thoroughly liberated. All democratic parties and all revolutionary classes in the country are united around the Chinese Communist Party. The preparatory meeting for the new Political Consultative Conference has been held, and the People's Democratic Republic of China will soon be born. On this exciting day, we should affirm from the positive side: "With the Communist Party, there is China."
    With the Communist Party, China is rejuvenated. The old China of five thousand years has become a new China of at most twenty-eight years old, and this new China will always be rejuvenated.
    Early this morning, I read Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." This is another epoch-making and brilliant proclamation. This is the will of all the Chinese people, the voice of all the Chinese people. Chairman Mao guarantees us: our China will steadily move from new democracy to socialism to communism. Chairman Mao guarantees us: our China will always be rejuvenated from now on.
    I was very inspired by reading Chairman Mao's proclamation, so I wrote a poem, and I would like to recite it at this commemorative meeting as my ode to the great "July 1st" commemoration:
    Look, this rainbow that cuts through the sky,
    Listen, this is like the waves in the sea, with ten thousand thunders moving,
    This, encourages all the diligent and brave masters!
    This, awakens the confused dreams of those lingering in their pillows!
    Dear comrades, let us closely, closely lean together!
    Raise our hammers, sickles, guns, and pens and charge forward together!
    To commemorate "July 1st," it is best to dedicate our whole lives!
    Let us unanimously shout: Long live, the CCP, long live! Mao Zedong!

　　My poem is finished, but please allow me to shout once again:
　　Long live the great people's leader Chairman Mao!
　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party that serves the Chinese people wholeheartedly!
　　Long live the victory of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class!

　　北平“七一”纪念大会上的讲词
  　朱总司令的讲词
    【新华社北平二日电】朱总司令在北平“七一”二十八周年纪念大会上的讲话词，全文如下：
    同志们！
    今天我们大家，很兴奋地，来庆祝党的诞生二十八周年纪念日。二十八年来，我们的党，经过了大革命、土地革命、抗日战争和人民解放战争，到今天终于取得了中国革命的基本的胜利。国民党反革命统治的老巢南京和东亚第一大都市上海都解放了，武汉、杭州、南昌、西安也解放了。国民党反动统治已经宣告灭亡。人民解放军正在继续前进，不久，胜利的旗帜就可插遍全中国了。新的政治协商会议，已经开始了筹备工作，不久新民主主义的人民共和国和它的中央政府，就要宣告成立了。中国人民五千年历史的新的一页，不久就要正式开始了。这是中国人民的伟大胜利，中国共产党的伟大胜利，毛主席领导的伟大胜利。
    今天，我们来庆祝党的二十八周年，必须知道这个胜利是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是无产阶级国际主义的胜利。鸦片战争以后，中华民族在它被帝国主义侵略和封建势力压迫所造成的极端痛苦的生活中，曾做过许多英勇的斗争，许多英雄许多烈士表现了可歌可泣的精神，但这些斗争都失败了。只有等到十月革命以后，马列主义传到了中国，产生了中国共产党，中国人民的优秀代表人物们，一步一步学会了按照马列主义来办事，从这时起，中国革命的面貌就为之一新了；中国人民的斗争就一步一步走向最后胜利了。所以我们说中国革命所获得的历史性的胜利，是和马克思列宁主义的思想分不开的，只有马列主义才照明了中国人民奋斗的道路。如果没有这个思想，中国人民的胜利是不可能的。其次，我们还要知道，中国人民的胜利，是和全世界无产阶级的革命斗争分不开的。中国在过去是全世界一切帝国主义国家侵略的对象，这些帝国主义国家在中国长期保存着政治的、经济的、文化的侵略势力，这些势力压在中国人民的头上，使中国人民喘不过气来。这种侵略势力，是中国国内一切反动派的支持者和后台老板。要驱逐这种侵略势力，巩固自己的胜利，单靠中国人民自己是不可能的。事实上有了苏联的存在和它的日益强大，有了反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，消灭德国、意大利和日本的法西斯主义，有了东欧许多新民主主义国家的建立，有了全世界被压迫民族的反帝国主义斗争和英、美、法、意、日、德等资本主义国家内工人阶级和人民大众的革命斗争，中国人民在反帝国主义斗争中，才有了自己的朋友，才有了共同作战的同盟军，才能够取得今天的光辉的胜利。
    我们纪念党的诞生二十八周年，就必须加强全党马列主义的学习，加强党内国际主义的教育，提高全党马列主义思想水平，以便使我们的党走上更进一步的布尔塞维克化。
    同志们，中国革命基本上胜利了，但正如毛主席所指示我们的，推翻国民党的反动统治，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。更伟大、更艰苦、更复杂的任务还在前面。我们不应有任何自满，我们必须继续保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风和艰苦奋斗的作风。我们应当在伟大的经济建设中，把我们的国家从落后的农业国，变成先进的工业国。只有我们的工业发展了，在经济上不依赖外国了，我们民族的独立自主才有基础，我们人民的生活幸福才有保障。因此经济建设就成了全国胜利以后压倒一切的中心任务。为了做好经济建设的工作，必须做好两件事，第一，是贯彻毛主席所指示的公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的四面八方政策。这是我们经济建设唯一正确的指针。我们只有三个敌人，就是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，同时我们的革命营垒是由工人阶级和共产党领导，以工农为基础，团结小资产阶级和民族资产阶级组成的，我们要划清敌人和朋友的界限。这是和实行四面八方政策有密切联系的。第二，必须号召全党认真地、努力地学习做经济工作。共产党人有一个大长处，就是善于学习。一切不会的东西都可以学会，做经济工作同样也可以学会的。我们应当向先进的苏联学习，同时也向我们的敌人学习，向一切的人们学习。帝国主义者说我们不会做经济工作，我们一定要证明给全世界看，中国共产党人不仅善于办革命，而且也是善于办建设的。
    我们纪念党的诞生二十八周年，就必须特别认识经济建设的重要性，学习并贯彻毛主席的四面八方政策，学习开工厂，开农场，开商店，办合作社，办铁路，办银行，学习把我们新民主主义经济建设好。
    我们党二十八年来奋斗的成果，只是在中国这块土地上铺平了新社会建设的地基。今后我们将在这个地基上建设成一个庄严的、富丽的、新民主主义的大厦来。马列主义理论，保证了我们党二十八年来一个接一个的胜利。今后，在马列主义思想的照耀之下，我们党将领导全国人民经过新民主主义的建设，向着社会主义与共产主义前进。
  　薄一波同志讲词
    【本报讯】薄一波在北平“七一”二十八周年纪念大会上的讲词，原文如下：同志们：
    今天是我们中国共产党诞生的二十八周年的纪念日。这是我们党的最主要的一个纪念日，也是中华民族和中国人民最重要的纪念日之一。中国共产党的产生，是中国历史上一件最重大的事情。从中国共产党成立以后，中国的面貌就为之焕然一新，中国的历史就进入了一个新的时期。从此以后，中国历史的发展就离不开共产党了，中国共产党的胜利和失败，就代表着中国人民的胜利和失败，中国共产党的前进和后退，也就标志着中国历史的前进和后退。中国共产党已经成为中国人民政治生活中所不可或缺的因素，已经成为中国人民的中坚和灵魂，这是谁都不否认的了。因此，谁如果不了解中国共产党的历史，谁就不可能了解中国的近代史；谁如果不了解中国共产党的路线和方针，谁就不可能自觉地参加新中国的创造和建设。
    中国共产党从她诞生到今天，已经过了足足二十八个年头。二十八年来，我们党曾经历了极其迂回曲折的道路，从小组到根据地到全国。今天我们已经基本上打垮了国民党的反动统治，全国范围的最后的胜利，已为期不远。
    中国共产党自从建党以后，即投入了大革命，投入了实际斗争，一直到现在没有停止过，天天在进行斗争，流血的与不流血的、公开的与秘密的、合法的与非法的，以及各方面的斗争，政治的、军事的、群众的、统一战线的，赢得了中国革命的伟大胜利，也使我们的党得到很大的锻炼。我们的党成为布尔什维克的党，中国革命赢得这样伟大的胜利，是与毛主席的正确领导分不开的。在第一次大革命时期，毛主席就是正确的，但是在大革命末期，毛主席湖南农民运动考察报告这样的正确指导路线，都被当时机会主义者的领导所拒绝，因而使大革命陷于失败。在大革命失败以后，还在一九二八年井冈山时期，毛主席就规定了新条件下的政治的、军事的、组织的正确路线，使得后来的红军战争得到了迅速的发展。但是这个路线也在经过了一段曲折之后，才受到全党一致认识和接受。毛泽东思想在党内发展的过程，也就是中国革命胜利的过程。
    二十八年的历史证明，中国近代历史的发展，是离不开共产党的，共产党的发展，又是离不开毛主席的。
    我们党是经过如此迂回曲折的道路，积聚了如此丰富的革命经验，这样就把我们的党锻炼成为真正无坚不摧无攻不克的党了，成为不仅敢于而且能够胜利愉快地领导中国革命到最后的胜利。
  　彭真同志讲词
    【本报讯】彭真在北平“七一”二十八周年纪念大会上的讲词，原文如下：各位同志！各位来宾：
    经过二十八年的艰苦斗争，我们已经领导中国人民“取得了基本的胜利”。在一个四万万七千五百万人口的大国，人民取得这样的胜利，是一件影响世界全局的大事。我们应该庆祝我们的胜利，庆祝我们中国人民的觉悟程度和组织力量已经足以战胜帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义和国民党反动派。
    但是如果没有国际革命力量特别是社会主义的苏联给予我们的援助，没有毛主席和以毛主席为首的我党中央给予我们以英明老练的领导，我们是不可能取得今天这样的胜利的。因此，当我们庆祝胜利的时候，应该同时感谢国际革命力量特别是苏联的援助，并且庆幸我们有毛主席和我党中央这样英明的领导。
    同志们！现在我们已经取得基本的胜利了，但我们不可骄傲，不可自满，更不可懈怠。“我们的事情还很多”。毛主席指示我们：“譬如走路，过去的工作，只不过象万里长征走完了第一步。残余的敌人尚待我们彻底消灭；严重的经济建设任务摆在我们面前。”说得远些，我们还要经过“人民民主共和国，到达社会主义和共产主义，到达阶级的消灭和世界大同”。我们必须再接再厉，发扬成绩，改正缺点和错误，不断把工作作得更好。
    北平工作的同志，在纪念“七一”的时候，除了切实遵照毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中，朱总司令和董必武同志在大会讲话中给我们的指示，进行自己的工作外，还应该注意些什么呢？我们以为：
    第一、必须坚持刻苦朴素的作风，不要象“李自成进北京”一样，被享乐腐化和旧势力所吞蚀。
    我们坚持刻苦的作风，是不是说我们是“吃苦主义”者呢？不是！只是因为我们的生产力还很不发展，生产还未很好的恢复和发展，因而我们的指战员，我们自己的阶级——工人阶级和广大农民的生活都还很苦，所以我们仍须坚持刻苦的作风。等到将来生产力发展，劳动人民生活都得到改善，我们共产党员即人民勤务员，当然也可以和劳动人民一样，改善自己的生活。我们和国民党反动派不同，我们必须和劳动人民同甘共苦。
    第二、必须全心全意依靠工人阶级。如何依靠工人阶级呢？只有加强工人阶级的政治教育，提高他们的政治觉悟，保证工人的物质生活，才能使全体工人群众与我们更密切地结合起来，成为一切工作的最可靠的支柱。所谓保证工人的物质生活，必须把它当作仅次于指战员的生活来注意，至少应和机关工作人员的生活予以同等的注意。但是所谓依靠工人阶级，不是把应该团结的其他阶级一脚踢开；保证工人物质生活也不应该影响生产的恢复和发展。恰恰相反，必须贯彻毛主席所给予我们的分清敌友即“三个敌人，四个朋友”和“四面八方”的指示。
    第三、必须亲切地关心农民的利益，农民的生活。工农联盟是人民民主共和国的基础，农民在人民解放战争中，是出了最大力量和作了最大牺牲的，没有工农的巩固合作，就没有人民革命的胜利，没有巩固的人民民主共和国。要巩固这种合作，我们除了教育农民、领导农民，发展农村生产外，在城市中，必须好好恢复改进和发展我们的生产，供给农民大量的质量好、价格便宜的工业品——他们所必须的一些生产资料和消费资料。生产乃是我们当前压倒一切的中心任务，可是恰恰在这一方面，我们的经验很缺，所懂的很少，我们必须虚心地学会作经济工作，学会工厂的民主管理，学会掌握技术，特别是学会按照毛主席指示的“四面八方”政策来指导整个国民经济，不然就不可能以最快的速度恢复和发展生产，变农业国为工业国，并切实改善农民以至全体人民的生活。
    最后我们号召同志们认真地学习马克思列宁主义的观察问题处理问题的立场观点和方法，用马克思列宁主义的理论，用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想，来武装我们的头脑，努力作一个斯大林毛泽东的好学生。
  　沈钧儒先生讲词
    【本报讯】沈钧儒在北平“七一”二十八周年纪念大会上的讲词，原文如下：
    今天是中国共产党的生日，中国共产党诞生于一九二一年七月一日，到现在整整的二十八年。
    在这二十八年中间，中国人民发动了反帝反封建的大革命，消灭了和帝国主义勾结的北洋军阀，打败了日本法西斯的武装侵略，推翻了地主阶级的封建统治。在最近三年中，中国人民解放战争，又得到了空前大胜利，基本上消灭了在美帝国主义卵翼之下的国民党反动政府，中国人民革命的最后的全面的胜利就在眼前。
    在这二十八年中间，人民创造了自己的军队——中国人民解放军；人民创造了自己的文化——革命的新文化；目前中国人民又正在建造自己的国家——人民民主共和国。
    在二十八年以前，中国也有过许多次革命，有过不断的政治、经济、文化斗争。但人民从不曾得到过真正的胜利，中国革命也不曾得到过象今天那样的彻底的胜利。
    原因很简单：二十八年以前没有中国共产党。二十八年才有中国共产党。
    今天发表的毛主席纪念论文，正确地指出：“工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政——这就是我们的公式，这就是我们的主要经验，这就是我们的主要纲领”。
    在今天，全中国人民，包含工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级，都应当采取这一公式，都应当接受这一经验，都应当服从这一纲领。他指示了我们国家与人民的光明远景，他也指示了目前国家与人民对内对外应当采取的方针：对内我们要实行人民民主专政，对外我们要联合世界上以平等待我的民族及各国人民共同奋斗！
    全中国同胞！各民主党派各革命阶级的人士！让我们用行动来祝贺中国共产党的生日罢。全国人民要永远和中国共产党靠拢，向中国共产党和人民领袖毛泽东学习，我们一定要“一面倒”，我们要分清敌和友。我们不怕刺激敌人，但决不抛弃友人。让我们团结一致，迅速建设人民民主专政的新国家。“团结一致”，中国人民愿意拿这四个字，献给中国共产党和毛泽东主席，作为庆贺生日的一份礼物。
  　郭沫若先生讲词
    【本报讯】郭沫若在北平“七一”二十八周年纪念大会上的讲词，原文如下：亲爱的朋友们：今天是中国共产党二十八岁的诞辰，这应该是我们全中国人民的一个伟大的国庆。全中国的人民都要以满腔的热诚表示最热烈的庆贺。
    现在差不多全中国都充满着这样的歌声：“没有共产党就没有中国”。一点儿也不错，中国假使没有中国共产党，中国早就在一群卖国贼的手里亡掉了。
    但是，在今天，中国人民解放军已经获得了决定性的胜利，全中国的人民快要全面地得到彻底的解放了。全国各民主党派，各革命阶层，都团结在中国共产党的周围，新政治协商会议的筹备会已经召开，中华人民民主共和国不久就快要诞生了。在这样令人欢欣鼓舞的今天，我们倒应该从正面来肯定地说：“有了共产党才有了中国”。
    中国有了共产党，中国是年青化了。五千年的旧中国成为了至多只有二十八岁的新中国，而且这个新中国是会永远年青化下去的。
    今天清早，我读了毛主席的“论人民民主专政”。这又是一篇划时代的辉煌的文告。这是全中国人民的意志，全中国人民的呼声，毛主席替我们保证：我们中国会稳步地由新民主主义而社会主义而共产主义。毛主席替我们保证：我们中国从此会永远年青化下去了。
    我读了毛主席的文告，很受感奋，因而我做一首诗，我愿意在这纪念大会上朗诵出来，作为我献给伟大的“七一”纪念的颂辞：
    看呵，这一道划破太空的长虹，
    听呵，这象大海里的波涛一样万雷荡动，
    这，鼓励了勤劳英勇的全体的主人翁！
    这，惊醒了缠绵枕席者的迷离的残梦！
    亲爱的战友们，让我们紧紧地紧紧地靠拢！
    举起我们的铁锤，镰刀，枪和笔一齐向前冲锋！
    要纪念“七一”，最好把我们的全生命来献奉！
    让我们一致地高呼：万岁哟，中共，万岁哟！毛泽东！
　　我的诗念完了，但请让我再作一次的高呼：
　　伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
　　全心全意为中国人民服务的中国共产党万岁！
　　工人阶级领导的人民民主专政胜利万岁！
