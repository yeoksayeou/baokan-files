Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: Milan dispatch: On June 29th, Saillant delivered a general report on the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions at the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Saillant declared: The World Federation of Trade Unions has waged an irreconcilable struggle against fascism.

The World Federation of Trade Unions has fought against war and its causes, and for the establishment of a solid and lasting peace. It has called on all workers in the world to join the ranks of peace fighters. The front for the struggle for world peace is capable of thwarting the activities of imperialism and the aggressive policies of monopoly capitalists. Constant activity for a just and lasting peace is the essence of the World Federation of Trade Unions' existence.

Saillant said: The World Federation of Trade Unions has organized and united trade unions from all over the world, regardless of race, nationality, religion, or political differences, into its ranks. In recent years, several new trade union organizations, such as those in Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam, North Korea, South Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Philippines, Tunisia, Trieste, Chile, Southern Rhodesia, and Siam, have been admitted to the World Federation of Trade Unions by the Executive Committee in accordance with this principle. The connection between the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Malayan Federation of Trade Unions has also been established. Based on the recommendations of the First World Congress of Trade Unions, we have fought against attempts to split trade unions at the national and international levels. For several months, trade union organizations in some countries have instead withdrawn from the World Federation of Trade Unions, attempting to weaken the international significance of our organization. Representatives of the British Trades Union Congress, the American CIO, and the Dutch General Confederation of Labor arrogantly withdrew from the Executive Bureau meeting in January 1949. Less than six months after the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting in June 1947, it became clear that some people were trying to carry out conspiracies within the executive organs of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and these conspiracies ultimately aimed to undermine and eliminate our organization. We know that the purpose of the splitters infiltrating the executive organs of the World Federation of Trade Unions was to make it impossible for any consensus to be reached, thereby finding an excuse for international divisive policies.

The splitters pursue a policy of discrimination. We cannot follow them, and we will never follow this path. Our opponents—from trade union leaders who disagree with us to representatives of capitalism and employers—insist that the World Federation of Trade Unions pursues the goal of implementing communist policies. They also say that the policies of the World Federation of Trade Unions are guided by the policies of the Soviet government. What is the real essence of these slanders? According to them, a trade union of the working people is only a genuine organization of the working people when it proves capable of establishing an alliance with the enemies of countries like the Soviet Union. The main condemnation of us by these trade unionists is that the World Federation of Trade Unions has gained the support of 28.5 million free and voluntarily joined members of Soviet trade unions.

On the contrary, we are proud of the Soviet trade unions' joining the World Federation of Trade Unions. Soviet trade unions play a role in their country that no other country's trade unions in the world can play now. Soviet trade unions supervise a social insurance system that is unparalleled in the world. Soviet trade unions own sanatoriums, cultural rest areas, and children's camps; they have hundreds of thousands of libraries, which help to promote scientific, technical, and vocational knowledge. These trade unions participate in improving wage standards and production standards. What can workers' unions in capitalist countries lose by frequent contact with Soviet trade unions? Absolutely nothing. What can they gain? They can gain the results of experience in the collective management of social and professional organs implemented by workers and for workers. Only narrow nationalism can prevent trade union cadres from objectively evaluating and understanding the activities of Soviet trade unions.

After Saillant pointed out the despicable methods that the reactionaries might take to restrict the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, he stated: Some people may think that the World Federation of Trade Unions is forced to isolate itself from the working people by a fact, that is, several leaders of the Belgian trade unions arbitrarily decided to withdraw 500,000 trade union members in Belgium from our organization. However, the World Federation of Trade Unions has not been weakened by this. On the contrary, coinciding with the Belgian incident, in Shanghai alone, about one million working people joined the ranks of the World Federation of Trade Unions! It is quite clear that we will continue to maintain our relationship with all the working people in Belgium, and we will try to establish connections between sailors and dockworkers in Shanghai and sailors in Antwerp, London, Amsterdam, New York, or San Francisco.

After discussing the significance of this congress, Saillant stated: Now, the economic crisis and the threat of war loom over the world. There are many signs that an economic crisis is approaching. The working people will be the first to suffer from the increasingly imminent crisis. Because the workers will rise up to defend themselves, large-scale social conflicts will eventually accompany the economic crisis, and the monopoly capitalist ruling class will bear full responsibility for these social conflicts. If they dare to launch a war, then this war will inevitably lead to the defeat and punishment of all war instigators. The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions must declare that, in the face of these two dangers—the economic crisis and the threat of a new war—the working people, the trade union members of all countries, cannot be inactive or indifferent. The working class has proven that no one can thwart their growing power. This class has been able to take the destiny of the country into their own hands in some countries; in other countries, it has established a reliable vanguard of social progress and true democracy, which will triumph tomorrow.

This congress must call on all working people to unite closely so that they can use their concerted action to crush the policies that create social poverty and the threat of war. The results of the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions show the undeniable necessity of unified action by the working people and their trade unions. The international solidarity of the working people will triumph because the ideals of the World Federation of Trade Unions are deeply supported by the people of all countries in the world, because the purpose of the World Federation of Trade Unions is consistent with the purpose of the working people (regardless of race and nationality). The World Federation of Trade Unions unites millions of working people—trade union members. In October 1945, our membership was 65 million. Despite the split, this congress represents about 70 million trade union members. This means that the position of the World Federation of Trade Unions is as solid as ever.

In the conclusion of his report, Saillant called for tireless struggle for the unity of the working people and peace among nations.

　　世界工联活动的总报告
    世界工联总书记  赛扬
    【新华社北平三日电】米兰讯：六月二十九日，赛扬在世界工联第二届代表大会上，作了关于世界职工联盟活动的总报告。赛扬宣称：世界工联对于法西斯主义曾进行了不调和的斗争。
    世界工联曾为了反对战争及其起因、为了建立巩固与持久的和平而斗争。它曾号召世界上一切工人参加和平斗士的阵线。为世界和平而斗争的阵线，是能够挫败帝国主义的活动及垄断资本家的侵略政策的。为公正与持久的和平而经常进行活动，便是世界工联存在的实质。
    赛扬说：世界工联已把全世界的职工会，不分种族、国籍、宗教与政治的差异，组织并团结在它的行列中。近几年来，有若干新的职工会组织，如德、日、印尼、越南、北朝鲜、南朝鲜、蒙古人民共和国、菲律宾，突尼西亚、的里雅斯特、智利、南罗得西亚、暹罗，业经执委会按照这个原则被吸收入世界工联。世界工联与马来亚职工联合会的联系，也同样建立起来了。我们根据第一届世界职工联盟代表大会的建议，在各国内与国际上对分裂职工会的企图进行了斗争。几个月以来，有若干国家的职工会组织却相反地脱离了世界工联，希图削弱我们组织的国际意义。英国职工大会，美国产联与荷兰总工会的代表于一九四九年一月傲慢地退出执行局会议。在一九四七年六月世界工联理事会会议之后不到六个月，大家就明白有人力图在世界工联的执行机关内进行阴谋活动，这些阴谋归根究底就是企图破坏和取消我们的组织。我们知道，分裂分子混入世界工联执行机关的目的，就是要使任何一致的意见都不可能通过，并由此而找到国际分裂政策的口实。
    分裂分子奉行歧视的政策。我们不能依从他们，并且我们将永远不遵循这条道路。我们的反对者——从意见不合的职工会领袖起到资本主义与雇主的代表止——硬说世界工联追求着实行共产党政策的目的。他们又说：世界工联的政策是由苏联政府的政策指导的。这些谰言的真正主旨是什么呢？照他们的意见，劳动人民的职工会只有当它证明能够与如象苏联那样的国家的敌人建立联盟的时候，才是真正的劳动人民的组织。这些职工运动者对我们的主要谴责，就是世界工联获得了二千八百五十万的自由和自愿加入苏联职工会的会员的支持。
    相反地，我们却以苏联职工会的加入世界工联为荣。苏联职工会在它们国内起着现在世界上没有任何一个国家的职工会所能够起的作用。苏联职工会督导着世界上无可比拟的社会保险制度。苏联职工会拥有疗养院、文化休憩所、儿童营；它们有数十万所图书馆，这些图书馆有助于推广科学、技术与职业的知识。这些职工会参加改进工资标准与生产标准。资本主义国家工人的工会，由于与苏联职工会的经常接触而能够失去些什么呢？绝对地，什么都失去不了。它能得到什么呢？它能够得到由工人而且为工人实行的社会与职业机关集体管理的经验的成果。只有狭隘的民族主义，才能阻止职工会干部客观地估价并了解苏联的职工会活动。
    赛扬在指出反动派可能采取种种限制世界工联活动的卑劣方法后称：有些人可能认为世界工联被下一事实所迫使，而与劳动人民隔绝，这一事实就是比利时职工会几个领袖专横地决定使比利时五十万职工会会员脱离我们的组织。但是，世界工联并未因此而削弱。相反地，与比利时事件同时，仅只上海一地，便有约一百万劳动人民参加世界工联的行列！十分显然，我们将继续维持我们与比利时一切劳动人民的关系，而且我们将设法在上海的海员及码头工人与安特卫普、伦敦、阿姆斯特丹、纽约或旧金山等地的海员之间，建立联系。
    赛扬在论述本届代表大会的意义后称：现在，经济危机和战争的威胁笼罩着世界。有许多迹象显示经济危机正在接近。首先遭受日益迫近的危机的打击的将是劳动人民。由于工人们将起而保卫自己，因此巨大规模的社会冲突终将随经济危机而俱来，对这种社会冲突，独占资本家统治阶级要负完全的责任。假若他们胆敢发动战争，那么这一次战争将不可避免地使一切战争挑拨者被击败并受到惩罚。世界工联第二届代表大会必须声明，面对着这两个危险——经济危机和新战争的威胁，劳动人民——一切国家的职工会会员不能无所动作或漠不关心。工人阶级已经证明没有谁能够挫败他们的日益增长的力量。这一阶级已能够在某些国家把国家的命运掌握在他们自己的手里；在其他的国家，则已建立起社会进步和真正民主的可靠的先锋队，这种进步与民主将在明天获得胜利。
    本届代表大会必须号召一切劳动人民紧密地团结起来，以便能够以他们的协同行动，来粉碎制造社会贫困和战争威胁的政策。世界工联活动的成果，显示了劳动人民及其职工会有统一行动的不可怀疑的必要性。劳动人民的国际团结将赢得胜利，因为世界工联的理想是深得全世界一切国家的人民所拥护的，因为世界工联的宗旨与劳动人民（不分种族和国籍）的宗旨一致的。世界工联团结了千百万的劳动人民——职工会会员。在一九四五年十月，我们的会员是六千五百万。尽管有着分裂，但这次代表大会却代表着约七千万的职工会会员。这意味着世界工联的地位仍如以往一样坚固。
    赛扬在他的报告的结语中，号召为劳动人民的团结和各民族间的和平而不倦地斗争。
