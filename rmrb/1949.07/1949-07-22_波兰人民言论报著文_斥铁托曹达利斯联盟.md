　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 21st: The Polish News Agency, Warsaw, reports: In an article titled "The Alliance of Tito and Tsaldaris," the People's Voice writes: On July 4th, in Yugoslavia, Tito's officers met with Major Petrobolos, commander of the 516th Battalion of the Greek fascist army. British and American officers also attended the meeting. On July 5th, the Athens fascist royalist army attacked several detachments of the Greek Democratic Army from behind on the southern border of Greece. On July 10th, Tito announced the closure of the Greek-Yugoslav border, attempting to imply that he had previously provided actual assistance to the Greek Democratic Army. However, the facts prove that the battles fought by the Democratic Army throughout Greece are due to the support of the vast majority of the Greek people. Various fascists and imperialists have praised this new provocation by the Tito elements. For a long time, the United States and Britain have firmly advocated cooperation between the Belgrade regime and the Athens government as a condition for the former to obtain credit loans. Therefore, it is no coincidence that Tito openly requested loans from Western countries in the same speech in which he announced the closure of the Greek-Yugoslav border. However, the Tito elements are unable to save the Greek royalist fascist regime, because even its Anglo-Saxon masters are powerless to accomplish this task. The newspaper concludes: The alliance with Tsaldaris shows how low the Tito clique has fallen; it is now forced to establish an alliance with its American master's lackeys in Greece.

  　斥铁托曹达利斯联盟
    【新华社北平二十一日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：人民言论报在论“铁托与曹达利斯的联盟”时写道：七月四日，在南斯拉夫，铁托的军官会见了希腊法西斯军第五一六营营长彼得罗波洛斯，英美军官均曾参加会议。七月五日，雅典法西斯保皇军从背后进攻希南边境的民主军的几个分遣队。七月十日，铁托宣布关闭希南边境，他企图用这一声明来暗示在此以前，铁托曾实际援助过希腊民主军。但是，事实证明，民主军在希腊全国境内进行的战斗，是由于希腊绝大多数人民的支持。各种各样法西斯分子和帝国主义者都赞扬铁托分子的这一新挑衅。美英长时间以来即坚决主张贝尔格莱德政权与雅典政府合作，以作为前者获得信用贷款的条件。因此，铁托在宣布关闭希南边境的同一演说中，公开向西方国家要求贷款，并不是偶然的。但是，铁托分子是无法挽救希腊保皇法西斯政权的，因为就是它的格鲁萨克逊主子都无力完成这个任务。该报结语称：与曹达利斯的联盟，显示铁托集团已堕落得多么的卑下；它现在已经不得不与它的美国主子在希腊的奴仆建立联盟了。
