Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th - The central organ of the China New Democratic Youth League, "China Youth," published in its ninth issue an essay entitled "Youth Work in the People's Liberation Army," which discusses the role and tasks of youth work in the PLA. The author, Xiao Hua, is currently the political commissar of a certain army corps in the Fourth Field Army and a member of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League.

The essay begins by pointing out: "We believe that the youth movement is an inseparable part of the cause of national and social liberation in China, and at the same time, it is closely linked with the twenty years of war of the People's Liberation Army, an inseparable bond." The armed struggle of the People's Liberation Army guarantees the status of the youth, and the influx of thousands of advanced young workers, peasants, and intellectuals into the PLA, as well as the support of the broad masses and youth in various regions for the War of Liberation, has provided the People's Liberation Army with a deep source of strength and achieved great victories. Therefore, the essay points out that young people should attach importance to armed struggle and, in accordance with the provisions of the Youth League's work program, "strive to study military affairs, strengthen their physique, and be ready to dedicate themselves to the motherland with unlimited loyalty at any time to protect the interests of the people."

The essay goes on to state the enormous role of youth in the PLA: "They bravely stand on the forefront of the People's War of Liberation, creating thousands of model shooters, model gunners, tank soldiers, blasting heroes, and combat heroes, and carrying forward the great spirit of Chinese youth who are brave, fearless of difficulties, and unafraid of sacrifice. Chen Shutang, the lone hero of Northeast China, boldly advanced in a battle, capturing hundreds of enemies; Dong Cunrui, a young soldier of only twenty years old, heroically sacrificed himself in the battle of Longhua in Rehe last year, holding explosives in his hand to destroy the enemy's bridgehead bunker, opening the way for the troops to charge; in the battle to liberate Jinzhou, Tian Qingwen, the political instructor of the 'White Tiger Company' of the 46th Army, a twenty-four-year-old youth, and thirty-seven warriors steadfastly defended a courtyard, smashing a day-long siege by an entire enemy regiment; Li Guangzheng, the blasting hero who bravely and continuously blew up twelve times in a row, braving enemy bullets and artillery fire, in the Battle of Siping, is also a twenty-five-year-old youth. On other battlefields, countless young people in the People's Liberation Army have made contributions to the people. The delegation of young PLA representatives who participated in the Youth League and Youth Congress were all combat models, work models, and young combat heroes who had made meritorious service in battle. In the military, political, and various technical studies of the troops, the young people have played a positive and exemplary role; in the cultural and recreational activities of the troops, and in various constructive movements, the young people have shown a vivid force of assault, becoming a powerful assistant to the Party in the political work of the troops. What is even more valuable is that our army has continuously cultivated a large number of cadres - 60 percent of the military commanders, political workers, and technical workers in the troops are excellent young cadres. The People's Liberation Army is the most practical school for cultivating young people."

The essay states: "Establishing the Youth League in the army is one of the important tasks in the army." Because young workers, peasants, students, and intellectuals with various special skills make up the majority of the troops, such as in the 41st Army of the People's Liberation Army, young people under the age of 25 account for 57 percent of the total number of troops, and this group of young people needs to be united, cultivated, and transformed by the Youth League. Young people in the army have special needs in their mental and physical development, and the Youth League must adopt suitable content and lively and interesting methods to meet and enlighten them. Youth League members from the local areas who join the army must also continue to be educated and cultivated by the Youth League. The essay emphasizes: "The Youth League is an important force for activating the troops, a force for overcoming certain weaknesses in the work of the troops and for attacking various construction tasks, and a powerful assistant to the Party and political work. It can make all political work tasks more smoothly completed, can enable our Party to have a large number of new reserve forces, supply a large number of new cadres, and enable young people to closely surround the Party and strive to consolidate the combat effectiveness of the troops and complete the Party's policy tasks."

The essay points out: "Young people who can join the army are basically more advanced elements from the local areas, so the League in the army has more favorable conditions for development than the local League, and truly becomes a broad mass organization of advanced young soldiers in the army."

Regarding the tasks of youth work in the army, the essay states: The most basic task of the Youth League in the army is to systematically educate League members and young soldiers with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, so that they become a vivid assault force in all work and combat of the army, and a capable assistant to political work; so that every young League member in the army can have a firm political stand and unwavering revolutionary integrity, not be complacent, not be arrogant, oppose all corrupt and degenerate behaviors, and develop an excellent style of revolutionary soldiers.

Finally, the essay puts forward the following specific tasks for youth work in the army:

(1) The Youth League should become the core of cultural work and activating the troops. We must actively lead the work of the company club's sports and entertainment; organize various extracurricular activities; regularly hold youth evening parties and sports meetings; activate the work of the army's theater troupe; organize various competitions in the army; carry out literacy and reading movements in the army, establish study mutual aid groups, and improve the scientific and cultural level of the army, so that young soldiers are not only model revolutionary soldiers, but also cultured model soldiers who understand art, literature, and sports.

(2) Young people should also become pioneers in technical learning and meritorious service movements on the battlefield. Therefore, learning technology, mastering technology, and improving technology have become the most urgent tasks of youth work in the army at present. The movement to establish merit in the troops should become a regular task of the Youth League, so that every young person can develop a shock role, a vanguard role, and create and cultivate more shooters, tank soldiers, airmen, motorcycle drivers, anti-aircraft gunners, demolition experts, model technicians, as well as lone heroes, combat heroes, and people's meritorious workers.

(3) The League in the army should participate in local youth work, mobilize tens of millions of young people in the Jiangnan area, and strive to unite the broad masses of young workers and students in the cities and the broad masses of young peasants in the countryside, consolidate the united front of youth democracy, and closely connect the army with the broad masses of local youth, establish a system of communication and liaison between the youth of the troops and the youth of the local areas. Help establish youth and children's organizations and carry out cultural activities, and absorb advanced youth to join the army. For the young League members who joined the army from the local areas, we should better unite them and use them as a bridge to closely connect with the local youth. Youth League members should become models in implementing all policies and disciplines.

(4) Youth League members should become models in consolidating the troops, launch a struggle against desertion in the troops, unite and educate the newly recruited soldiers, and transform the mercenary views, hometown concepts, hedonistic ideas, and other old ideas of the young soldiers liberated from the Kuomintang army. Actively participate in the sanitation work of the troops to reduce non-combat members and strengthen the combat strength of the troops.

(5) Ensuring the correct leadership of the Party over youth work is the decisive factor for the correct forward development of youth work in the army. Because the army is a highly centralized combat organization, the independence of the Youth League in the army has certain limitations compared with the local League organization. It is a part of the entire political work of the army, so it needs more help and concern from the Party and political organs, and put youth work in an appropriate position in the current political work construction to ensure the smooth completion of the League building task.

### 人民解放军中的青年工作　“中国青年”论文

　　人民解放军中的青年工作
　  “中国青年”论文
    【新华社北平二十日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央机关刊物“中国青年”第九期，刊载题为“人民解放军中的青年工作”的论文，对青年工作在解放军中的作用和任务，有所论述。作者萧华，现任第四野战军某兵团政治委员，并为中国新民主主义青年团中央委员之一。
    论文首先指出：“我们认为青年运动是中国民族解放与社会解放事业中不可分离的一部分，同时也是同人民解放军二十年来的战争紧密联结在一起，血肉不可分割的”。人民解放军的武装斗争保障了青年的地位，而成千累万的先进的青年工农和知识分子涌入解放军，各地广大群众和青年对解放战争的支援，则使人民解放军得到深厚的力量的泉源，取得伟大的胜利。因此，论文指出青年们应重视武装斗争，按照青年团工作纲领的规定：“努力学习军事，锻炼体格，随时准备以无限忠诚献身祖国，保卫人民利益”。
    论文接着指出，青年在解放军中的巨大作用说：“他们英勇地站在人民解放战争的最前线，创造了成千成万的模范射击手、模范炮手、坦克手、爆炸英雄、战斗英雄，发扬了中国青年英勇果敢不怕困难、不怕牺牲的伟大精神。名传东北的孤胆英雄陈树棠，在一次战争中大胆猛进，俘敌百名；年方二十岁的青年战士董存瑞，去年在热河隆化战斗中，用手托着炸药炸毁敌人桥头城堡，自己英勇牺牲，打开了部队的冲锋之路；在解放锦州的战斗中，三十七位勇士坚守住一所院落，粉碎了敌人一团兵力一整天的围攻的四十六军‘白老虎连’的政治指导员田庆文同志，便是一位二十四岁的青年；四平战斗，一晚上冒着敌人的枪林弹雨，英勇地连续十二次爆炸的爆炸英雄李广正同志，也是一位二十五岁的青年。其他各个战场上，解放军的青年为人民立功的数以万计。参加青年团及青年代表大会的解放军青年代表团，全部是在战斗中立了功的战斗模范、工作模范、和青年战斗英雄。在部队的军事、政治与各种技术的学习上，青年们起了积极的模范作用；在部队文化娱乐活动中，在各种建设性的运动中，青年们都显出了生动的突击力量，成为党在部队政治工作中的有力助手。更可珍贵的就是我军不断地培养了大批干部——部队中百分之六十的军事指挥员、政治工作者、技术工作者，均为优秀的青年干部。解放军乃是最实际的培养青年的学校。”
    论文说：“在部队中建立青年团，是部队中重要的工作之一。”因为青年的工、农、学生以及有各种特殊技能的知识分子，占部队中的大多数，如人民解放军四十一军中，二十五岁以下的青年占全军人数的百分之五十七，这批青年需要由青年团加以团结、培养和改造。部队青年在精神和体力发展上，有他们特殊的需要，又须要青年团采取相适合的内容和活泼有趣的方法来加以满足和启发。地方团员参加到军队中来，也须得由青年团继续加以教育培养。论文着重指出：“青年团是活跃部队的重要力量，是克服部队中某些工作弱点与各种建设工作的突击力量，是党与政治工作的有力助手。他能使一切政治工作任务更加顺利完成，能使我们党有大批新生的后备军，供给大批新的干部，使青年们紧紧围绕在党的周围，为巩固部队的战斗力，为完成党的政策任务而奋斗。”
    论文指出：“能参军的青年，基本上都是地方上较先进的分子，因此军队中的团比地方更有有利发展的条件，真正成为军队中先进青年战士的广泛群众性组织。”
    关于军队青年工作任务，论文说：军队中青年团的最基本的任务，就是有系统地用马克思列宁主义与毛泽东思想不断地教育团员与青年战士，使他们成为部队中一切工作和战斗的生动的突击力量，成为政治工作的得力的助手；使部队每个青年团员能具有坚定的政治立场，与忠贞不移的革命气节，不自满，不骄傲，反对一切腐化堕落行为，养成优良的革命军人作风。
    最后，论文对部队中的青年工作，提出如下几种具体任务：
    （一）青年团要成为部队文化工作与活跃部队的核心。我们必须积极地来领导连队俱乐部体育文娱的工作；组织各种的课外活动；经常地按期地举行青年晚会与运动会；活跃部队剧团工作；组织部队的各种比赛；开展部队的识字与读书运动，建立学习互助组，提高部队的科学文化水准，使青年战士不仅是模范的革命军人，而且是有文化的模范战士，懂得艺术文学，懂得体育。
    （二）部队技术学习与战场立功运动，青年也应成为先驱。因此学习技术，掌握技术，提高技术，成为目前建军中青年工作最迫切的任务。部队的立功运动，更应该成为青年团的经常任务，使每个青年能够发扬突击作用，打先锋作用，创造和培养出更多的射击手、坦克手、航空员、摩托驾驶员、高射炮手、爆破手、模范技术人员以及独胆英雄、战斗英雄、人民功臣。
    （三）军队中的团应该参加地方青年工作，发动江南几千万青年群众，争取与团结城市的广大的青年工人与学生及乡村中的广大的青年农民群众，巩固青年民主统一战线，密切军队与广大的地方的青年群众的联系，建立部队青年与地方青年联欢与联系制度。帮助建立青年儿童组织及开展文化活动，吸收先进青年参加到部队中来。对于地方参军的青年团员，更应很好地团结他们，通过他们这个桥梁去密切联系地方青年。青年团员要成为执行一切政策与纪律中的模范。
    （四）青年团员应成为巩固部队的模范，展开部队反逃亡斗争，团结与教育新参军战士，改造从国民党军队中解放过来的青年士兵的雇佣观点、家乡观念、享乐思想和其他的旧思想。对部队的卫生工作应积极参加，减少非战斗成员，以坚固部队战斗力量。
    （五）保证党对于青年工作的正确领导是部队青年工作正确向前发展的决定因素。因为军队是一个高度集中的战斗组织，青年团在部队中的独立性比地方团的组织有着某些局限性。他是整个部队政治工作的一部分，因此更需要党与政治机关给以更多的帮助与关心，把青年工作放到目前政治工作建设中适当的位置上，以保证建团任务的顺利完成。
