The Zhangjiakou Machinery Factory of the North China Machinery Company has mostly completed its construction and has begun operations since construction began in March. Over the past three months, the factory workers have overcome difficulties such as the collapse of factory buildings and incomplete machine parts. By the end of June, the first and second machine shops had assembled 204 machines, including 84 electric motors and 120 machine tools. In addition, there are more than 80 machines that can be repaired. Some of the machines in the first and second machine shops have already started operation.

The factory currently has 543 employees, and the machine shops are divided into ten departments, including machine manufacturing, repair and assembly, fitter, forging, casting, electrical, model making, nail making, and lumbering. At present, the focus of work is not only on factory construction and the completion of semi-finished products, but also on operating businesses such as wire nails and iron pots. After the completion of the factory, it will supply a large number of machines to all factories and mines along the Ping-Sui Railway. It has already undertaken the manufacturing of pulpers and copper mesh for the Zhangjiakou Rubber Factory and the Xuanhua Paper Mill. It is expected that the business will be fully developed in August. (Ru)
