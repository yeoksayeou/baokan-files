　　North China People's Government
  　Order to the Beiping People's Court
  　Eliminate Feudal Remnants
    Li Yunzhong and Others Suspended for Torturing Detainees and Ordered to Reflect in Court
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] All liberated areas' people's governments have long issued clear orders prohibiting the use of corporal punishment on criminal suspects. Li Yunzhong, the deputy director of the Beiping People's Court detention center, and others lacked sufficient understanding of this issue. On May 25th, Li Yunzhong actually hung up the thief Chen Jianmin with a rope and slapped him several times. Zhao Zengshu, the deputy section chief of the Education Section, also participated. Subsequently, incidents of Zhao Zengshu, clerk Hou Degui, squad leader Yang Changzhi, guard Xu Shouyong, and Nie Fusheng beating criminal suspects occurred one after another. After the court learned of this, it immediately stopped the behavior and first suspended Li Yunzhong, Hou Degui, and Nie Fusheng from their work, ordered them to reflect in court, and then punished them; and ordered the others to conduct self-criticism and correct their mistakes. For this reason, the North China People's Government specially instructed the Beiping Municipal Government to supervise the court to conduct strict review and correction. It also strengthened education for all personnel in the detention center, formulated prohibitions, and ensured that this kind of feudal remnant bad practice would never happen again. (Chang)

　　华北人民政府
  　令饬北平人民法院
  　肃清封建残余作风
    李云中等吊打案犯调院反省
    【本报讯】对案犯禁止使用肉刑，各解放区人民政府早有明令。北平市人民法院看守所副所长李云中等对此一问题，认识不足，五月二十五日李云中竟将窃盗犯陈健民用绳吊起，并打数掌。管教科副科长赵增书亦参与其事。接着又连发生赵增书、干事侯德贵、班长杨昌芝、看守员徐寿永、聂福生等打案犯的事情。院方得悉后，当即制止，并将李云中、侯德贵、聂福生三人先行停止工作，调院反省后予以处分；并令其他诸人自我检讨，改正错误。华北人民政府为此特指令平市府转法院督饬严加检讨纠正。并对全所人员加强教育，订定禁约，保证此种封建残余的坏作风，今后不再发生。　　　（常）
