　　Stalin's Classic Work
    ——“For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy” Monograph
    Professor Keluruokefu
    Translated by Xue Yi
    It will soon be twenty-five years since the publication of Comrade Stalin's brilliant work "On the Foundations of Leninism" in April 1924. This work, including Comrade Stalin's series of lectures to students at Moscow's Sverdlov University, is a brilliant interpretation and profound theoretical analysis of Leninism.

    In "On the Foundations of Leninism," Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, made the first theoretical summary and analysis of the basic problems of Leninism from Lenin's legacy. This is a huge contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism and a new step forward in the scientific development of the laws of social life. The theory of Marxism-Leninism has been raised to a new and higher level. "On the Foundations of Leninism" equipped communist parties around the world with a powerful ideological weapon.

    Stalin creatively developed Lenin's great thought, enriched it based on the experience of the international revolutionary movement and the experience of socialist initial construction in the Soviet Union, and concretized it. Stalin armed the Bolshevik cadres with a clear knowledge of the specific paths and methods by which the proletariat carries out its historical task as gravediggers of the bourgeoisie and creators of a new socialist society. In "On the Foundations of Leninism," Stalin summarized, concretized, and further developed the proletariat's worldwide historical mission that had been scientifically proven by Marx and Engels and brilliantly developed by Lenin. In this work, Stalin points out the revolutionary guide of action through the entire importance of Leninism.

    Just like Stalin's other works such as "Trotskyism or Leninism," "The October Revolution and the Tactics of the Russian Communists," and "On Several Questions of Leninism," his most precious labor in "On the Foundations of Leninism" is to give Trotskyism a heavy blow head-on and hold high Leninism as the only correct doctrine for specifically realizing the proletariat's worldwide historical task.

    Trotsky and his accomplices, the vicious enemies of the working class, used various methods to harm the young Soviet state, maliciously attempting to lead the party away from Lenin's revolutionary path of transforming the national economy and forcing the Soviet state to surrender to imperialism.

    Under Stalin's leadership, the party strengthened the unity of the party at all levels. The outstanding task accomplished by Stalin's work "On the Foundations of Leninism" is that it ideologically defeated Trotskyism, which has great historical significance for the Bolshevik Party and communist parties around the world.

    Stalin revealed the essence of Leninism, explained what Lenin added to the treasure house of Marxism in his works, and thus the special and new contributions that are inseparable from Lenin's name, and gave Leninism a classic definition.

    Stalin pointed out that "Leninism not only revived Marxism, but also went a step further, developing Marxism forward under the new conditions of capitalism and the proletarian struggle." Stalin used this definition to emphasize the creativity of Lenin's doctrine. Stalin provides countless examples of the creative development of Marxism-Leninism in all his works, thus enriching the science of Marxism-Leninists with new ideas based on new historical experience.

    Stalin shattered the attempt to oppose Marxism and Leninism, congratulating Leninism as a purely national, purely Russian phenomenon, while Marxism was an international phenomenon. Stalin emphatically emphasized the worldwide historical and international significance of Leninism. Stalin explained: "Leninism is an international phenomenon rooted in the entire international development process, and not just a Russian phenomenon."

    Stalin analyzed the historical roots of Leninism and pointed out the international significance of Lenin's doctrine. He gave a brilliant description of imperialism and its contradictions, and concluded that Russia at the beginning of the 20th century was the focus of all the contradictions of imperialism and was on the eve of the bourgeois revolution, which under the conditions of imperialism was the prelude to the proletarian revolution. Now, Lenin's prediction of the vanguard task of the Russian proletariat and Stalin's words at the Sixth Congress of the CPSU that any idea that Russia would illuminate the road to socialism and that Europe would point the way must be abandoned have all been confirmed. As Stalin pointed out, Russia has become the home of the theory and strategy of proletarian revolution, and Lenin, the leader of the Russian proletariat, has become the creator of this theory and strategy and the leader of the international proletariat.

    Stalin's basic contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism is the following definition of Leninism: "Leninism is the Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. More precisely: Leninism in general is the theory and strategy of proletarian revolution, especially the theory and strategy of proletarian dictatorship."

    This classic definition of Leninism completely expresses the essence of Leninism and is a powerful warning to all opportunists and pseudo-Marxists—those who have tried and still try to distort Lenin's doctrine in order to harm the cause of the working class.

    Lenin and Stalin's works are examples of uncompromising and relentless struggle against the theoretical, political, and strategic exposure of every opportunist and revisionist, and also examples of fighting for the persistence of Marxist-Leninist principles.

    Stalin's instruction on the international nature of Leninism will always have its theoretical and practical importance for the working classes and their parties in all countries around the world. It is well known that the adventurer Tito clique betrayed Leninism. Tito and his group of unfortunate theorists invented "Yugoslav Marxism" and abandoned the doctrines of Lenin and Stalin. Only people like Tito's party, who are steeped in nationalism and chauvinism, can invent such bizarre things. Practical adventurism, theoretical ignorance, bourgeois nationalism, traitors to democracy, socialism, and international working-class solidarity, accomplices of Anglo-American imperialists—this is the face of "Yugoslav Marxism."

    Stalin's "On the Foundations of Leninism" profoundly analyzes Lenin's method and theory, the dictatorship of the proletariat, the peasant question and the national question, strategy and tactics, and Lenin's doctrine on the party and working style. Combining these issues clarified by Stalin in turn gives a scientific explanation of the principles of Leninism.

    Stalin pointed out the revolutionary spirit of criticism in Lenin's method from the specific historical examples of Lenin's struggle against opportunism, and concluded that this not only revived Marxism, but also further developed Marxism and dialectical materialism.

    Lenin's method, a reliable weapon in Bolshevik activities, is a guide for communist parties in all countries in their struggle against various opportunist tendencies. Lenin's method is the organic unity between theory and practice. It teaches working-class parties to be self-critical in their work, to recognize mistakes, to correct mistakes in a timely manner, to listen to the opinions of the masses, and to believe in the strength of the working class.

    Stalin's words about the great role of revolutionary theory and its inseparable combination with revolutionary practice are of extraordinary importance to communist parties around the world: "Theory is the comprehensive experience of the workers' movement in all countries," Stalin wrote, "Of course, if theory is not linked to revolutionary practice, it will become an objectless theory, and likewise, practice will become blind practice if it is not guided by revolutionary theory." Stalin went on to point out that if theory is formed in close connection with revolutionary practice, it can become a great force in the workers' movement.

    Stalin sharply criticized the "theory" of spontaneity in the workers' movement—this ideological system of tailism, pointing out the political harm it may cause and emphasizing the leading role of the working class's vanguard, the working class party. He made a thorough analysis of Lenin's theory of proletarian revolution, which ideologically armed the Bolshevik Party and communist parties around the world, and inspired them with confidence that the cause of the working class would be victorious. This was a crushing blow to the Trotskyite theory of "permanent revolution" which underestimated the revolutionary strength of the peasantry, the strength and ability of the Russian proletariat to lead the peasantry, and denied the leading role of the proletariat.

    Stalin emphasized: The socialist nature of the October Revolution brilliantly confirmed Lenin's theory that the bourgeois democratic revolution would be transformed into a socialist revolution. The Russian October Revolution fully confirmed Lenin's doctrine on the inevitability and possibility of breaking the weakest link in the imperialist chain and on the initial victory of socialism within one country. The fact that the Soviet people, following Lenin's rules, under Stalin's leadership, and facing the encirclement of capitalist countries, have established socialism in the country is a very model of the profound truth of Lenin's theory of revolution, which Stalin further developed and concretized.

    Lenin's theory of proletarian revolution and its realization has worldwide historical significance. Socialism first triumphed in one country—Russia. The great Soviet Socialist Federal Republic is the first socialist country in the world, and it points out a clear path to the working class around the world. Today, with the help of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries are building a new socialist life. Lenin's brilliant revolutionary theory and the doctrines of Lenin and Stalin on communism are arming the vanguard of the working class in these countries. The working class in capitalist countries has gained confidence from their own strength, from the certainty that they will defeat the bourgeoisie, and from the great achievements of the victorious socialist region.

    Stalin profoundly analyzed all the most important issues in Leninism—the dictatorship of the proletariat. He pointed out that the dictatorship of the proletariat is a tool of the proletarian revolution, a tool of the proletariat's rule over the bourgeoisie, and that the Soviet regime is the state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    In his fierce criticism of the outdated theory of "pure" democracy under the capitalist system (which is now being promoted by the leaders of the right-wing socialist parties, the servants of imperialism), he pointed out that democracy under the capitalist system is the dictatorship of a minority of exploiters over the majority of the exploited. Only under proletarian democracy is it possible for the exploited to enjoy true freedom. Only then can proletarians and peasants truly participate in state management. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the best example of true democracy is the direct organization of the masses themselves, the Soviets, which are the most democratic and also the most prestigious organizations of the masses, which can facilitate the masses to participate in the construction and management of the new state as much as possible.

    Lenin-Stalin's theory of proletarian dictatorship has great international significance. This is a powerful ideological weapon for the vanguard of the working class and the working class party in their struggle to seize power and fight for socialism. The truth and the decisive proof of the strength of the theory of proletarian dictatorship is that socialism is being built in the people's democratic countries, where the people's democratic countries are carrying out the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The leading force in building socialism in the people's democratic countries is the working class. Once the traitor Tito clique abandoned the principle of proletarian dictatorship, the bourgeois system was immediately restored in Yugoslavia.

    In "On the Foundations of Leninism," Stalin analyzed and developed Lenin's ideas on the peasant question and the national question. Stalin emphasized that although the peasant question has great importance in Leninism, this is not the main thing in Leninism. Stalin went on to emphasize that the peasant question, as the question of the proletariat's allies in its struggle to seize power, is a derived question. The basic question of Leninism, the starting point of Leninism, is the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the question of the conditions for winning and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, the peasant question is still one of the most important questions of Leninism because it is part of the overall question of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    The national question is of extreme importance in Leninism. The chapter on this question in "On the Foundations of Leninism" is a development of Stalin's writings before the October Revolution and a further development of Lenin's theory. It is not difficult for us to correctly estimate the international theoretical and practical significance of Lenin and Stalin's works, which gave a profound analysis of the national question. In the Soviet Union, the complex national question has been brilliantly resolved, and the unquestionable evidence is that the friendship of the people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union has become one of the driving forces of the Soviet people. Lenin-Stalin's theory of the national question is a guiding principle for the working class and its parties in all countries around the world. In the people's democratic countries, the national question is being perfectly resolved based on the Lenin-Stalin policy.

    Starting from the premise of solving the national question in the era of imperialism, Lenin proposed that the struggles of oppressed nations against imperialism and for genuine national equality and genuine national independence must be constantly supported. Stalin especially emphasized that it is necessary to resolutely fight against the ideas of those imperialist chauvinists among the "socialists" within the major countries, who do not need to oppose their own country's imperialist government and are unwilling to help the colonial oppressed nations in their struggle for national independence for liberation.

    It is unnecessary to prove how timely the topic of the national question, which Stalin developed in his speech "On the Foundations of Leninism," is today. In its march to conquer the world, American imperialism has intensified its suppression and enslavement of the people of other countries, depriving them of their independence and sovereignty. Lenin-Stalin's topic of the national question exposes the great-power chauvinism and racial "theories" of these imperialists, whose cosmopolitanism, which they promote today, is the opposite of the narrow chauvinism of the warmongers.

    The part of Stalin's book on strategy and tactics is a creative further development of Lenin's ideas on this issue. Stalin pointed out that the unparalleled importance of strategy and tactics lies in the fact that it is the science of leading the proletarian struggle. Stalin's rich analysis of all the major issues of strategy and tactics is a valuable contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism and a guide to action for communist parties around the world in their struggle to defeat imperialism. The Bolshevik strategy and tactics are the model for all working-class parties.

    In "On the Foundations of Leninism," Stalin gave a detailed theoretical basis for Lenin's doctrine on the party, which is a step and guide to action for communist parties around the world. Stalin solemnly listed the following characteristics of the new type of party: The party—is the vanguard of the working class armed with revolutionary theory; The party—is the political leader of the working class, the general staff of the working class; The party—is the organized force of the working class; The party—is a tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat; The party—is the unity of will, not allowing the existence of factions; "The party is consolidated by clearing opportunists from its ranks."

    Stalin's "On the Foundations of Leninism" is a brilliant example of creatively developing Marxism-Leninism. This work educates communists with unshakable loyalty to Leninism, inspires them, and arms them in their struggle for the victory of communism. In the current situation, ideological education of party cadres based on the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin is of particular importance. Consolidating all the strength of the democratic camp to carry out the victorious struggle for world peace, these tasks are extremely clear today.

    The leaders of the right-wing socialist parties help the imperialists with servility. One of the important tasks of communist parties in all countries is to expose their treacherous conspiracies. Stalin's works, especially "On the Foundations of Leninism," play an important role in defending the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory. This work arms the proletariat in all countries around the world with knowledge of the laws of social life, and inspires them in their struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　斯大林的经典著作
    ——“争取持久和平与人民民主”专论
    克鲁若科夫教授
    学毅译
    从一九二四年四月斯大林同志底光辉著作“论列宁主义基础”初版问世以来，快届二十五年了。这著作包括斯大林同志对莫斯科斯维尔得洛夫大学学生一系列的演讲，乃是列宁主义底精采解释和深刻的理论分析。
    在“论列宁主义基础”中，列宁事业底伟大继承人斯大林，首次自列宁遗产中作理论的总结并分析了列宁主义的基本问题。这对马克思列宁主义宝库是一个巨大贡献，在社会生活规律的科学底发展上，则是向前迈了新的一步。马克思列宁主义者底理论被提到新的和更高的水平。“论列宁主义基础”以有力的思想武器装备了世界各国共产党。
    斯大林创造性地发展了列宁底伟大思想，在国际革命运动经验与在苏联社会主义初期建设经验的基础上丰富了这一思想，具体化了这一思想，斯大林用无产阶级实行他们作为资产阶级掘墓人又作为新的社会主义社会缔造者的历史任务底具体途径与具体方法的明确知识，来武装布尔什维克干部。斯大林在“论列宁主义基础”中概括了、具体化了、和进一步发展了那已为马克思恩格斯所科学地证明了的，又为列宁烂灿地发展了的无产阶级底全世界历史任务。在这著作中，斯大林通过列宁主义的全部重要性来指出它是行动的革命的指南。
    正如斯大林其他著作诸如：“托洛茨基主义或是列宁主义”、“十月革命与俄国共产党人底策略”和“论列宁主义的几个问题”一样，他在“论列宁主义基础”上面最珍贵的劳迹是：迎头给托洛茨基主义沉重的一棒，高举列宁主义作为具体实现无产阶级全世界历史任务的惟一正确的学说。
    工人阶级凶恶的敌人托洛茨基及其同伙，用各种方法来伤害年青的苏维埃国家，恶意企图使党离开列宁底改造国家经济的革命的道路，迫使苏维埃国家向帝国主义投降。
    在斯大林领导下，党强化了全党各级的统一。斯大林底著作“论列宁主义基础”所尽的卓越任务，就是它在思想上打败了托洛茨基主义，这，对于布尔什维克党及世界各国共产党，一样的有其巨大历史意义。
    ×　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　×
    斯大林揭示出列宁主义的本质，说明哪些是列宁在他底著作中所加进于马克思主义宝库里的，因而是与列宁名字分不开的特别的和新的贡献，并给列宁主义以一个经典的定义。
    斯大林指出“列宁主义不仅复活了马克思主义，而且更进了一步，在资本主义与无产阶级斗争新条件下向前发展了马克思主义”。斯大林用这个定义来强调列宁学说的创造性。斯大林在其全部著作中提供无数马列主义底创造性发展的范例，从而就在新的历史经验的基础上，用新的思想丰富了马克思列宁主义者的科学。
    斯大林粉碎了把马克思主义与列宁主义对立起来，祝列宁主义为纯粹民族的、纯粹是俄国的现象而马克思主义则是国际的现象的企图，斯大林着力地强调列宁主义底全世界历史的国际意义。斯大林说明：“列宁主义是根源于整个国际发展过程的国际现象，而并不单只是俄国的现象。”
    斯大林分析了列宁主义的历史根源，指出列宁学说的国际意义。他给帝国主义及其矛盾以一个天才的描写，得出了结论说，俄国在二十世纪开端是帝国主义所有一切矛盾的焦点，是处在资产阶级革命的前夜，而这个革命在帝国主义底条件下乃是无产阶级革命底序幕。现在，已全部证实了列宁关于俄国无产阶级先锋队任务的预言和斯大林在联共党第六次大会上所说俄国将照亮往社会主义之路而欧洲会指出道路的任何想法必须摒弃的话。正如斯大林所指出，俄国已成为无产阶级革命理论和策略底故乡，而俄国无产阶级的领袖列宁则已成为这个理论和策略的创造者和国际无产阶级的领袖。
    斯大林加进马克思列宁主义宝库的基本贡献就是他给列宁主义的下列定义：“列宁主义是帝国主义与无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义。更确切些说：列宁主义一般是无产阶级革命底理论和策略，特别是无产阶级专政底理论和策略”。
    这个列宁主义底经典定义，完整地表达了列宁主义的本质，对一切机会主义者和冒牌马克思主义者——这些人企图过并且仍然企图着曲解列宁底学说以便损害工人阶级的事业。——是一个有力的警告。
    列宁和斯大林底著作是对每个机会主义者及修正主义者在理论上、政策上、策略上的暴露作毫不妥协毫不留情的斗争的榜样，同时也是为坚持马克思列宁主义原则而斗争的榜样。
    斯大林底关于列宁主义的国际性质的指示，对于全世界各国工人阶级及其政党，永远有其理论的和实践的重要性。众所周知，冒险主义者铁托集团背叛了列宁主义。铁托和他那一群倒楣的理论家发明了“南斯拉夫马克思主义”，背弃了列宁和斯大林的学说。只有象铁托党从这样一些浸透着民族主义者和沙文主义者的人们才能够发明这种稀奇古怪的东西。实践上的冒险主义，理论上的一无所知，资产阶级民族主义，民主、社会主义和国际工人阶级团结的叛徒，英美帝国主义者的同谋——“南斯拉夫马克思主义”的面貌就是如此。
    ×　　　×　　　×  　×
    斯大林底“论列宁主义基础”深刻地分析了列宁的方法及理论、无产阶级专政、农民问题与民族问题、战略与策略，及列宁关于党和工作作风的学说。依次地把斯大林所阐明的这些问题合起来，就得出了列宁主义原则底科学的解释。
    斯大林从列宁所进行对机会主义斗争的具体历史榜样上，指出在列宁方法中批评的革命的精神，得出结论说：这不只是复活了马克思主义而已，而是更进一步发展了马克思主义及辩证唯物主义。
    列宁的方法，布尔什维克活动中的可靠武器，是各国共产党在其与各式各样机会主义倾向斗争时行动的指南。列宁的方法是理论与实践之间的有机统一。它教导工人阶级政党在工作中自我批评，认识错误，及时纠正错误，倾听群众意见，相信工人阶级底力量。
    斯大林所说关于革命理论底伟大作用及其与革命实践不可分割的结合的话，对于世界各国共产党，是有其非凡重要性的：“理论是世界各国工人运动底综合经验”，斯大林写道，“当然，理论若不和革命实践联系起来，就会变成无对象的理论，同样，实践若不以革命理论为指南，就会变成盲目的实践”。斯大林接着指出，理论如果是在和革命实践密切联系中形成的，那它就能成为工人运动底伟大力量。
    斯大林尖锐地批评工人运动中的自发性“理论”——这个尾巴主义底思想体系，指出它可能招致的政治上的损害并强调工人阶级先锋队即工人阶级党底领导作用。他对列宁底无产阶级革命理论作了一个彻底的分析，这个理论在思想上武装了布尔什维克党及世界各国共产党，以工人阶级事业将要胜利的信心激励他们。这对那轻估农民革命力量、轻估俄国无产阶级领导农民的力量和能力，并否认无产阶级领导作用的“不断革命论”的托洛茨基理论，乃是一个粉碎性的打击。
    斯大林强调：十月革命底社会主义性质，烂灿地证实了列宁底资产阶级民主革命将转变为社会主义革命的理论。俄国十月革命完全证实了列宁底关于打断帝国主义链条中最弱一环的必然与可能、和社会主义能够在一国范围内首先胜利的学说。苏联人民，追随着列宁底规则，在斯大林领导下，面对资本主义国家包围，已在国内建立了社会主义，这个事实乃是那由斯大林进一步发展和具体化的、列宁底关于革命的理论的深刻真理之非常的典范。
    列宁底无产阶级革命理论及其实现有着全世界历史意义。社会主义首先在一个国家——俄国胜利了。伟大的苏维埃社会主义联邦共和国是世界上第一个社会主义国家，它向全世界工人阶级指出明确的道路。今天，由于苏联的帮助，人民民主国家正在建设新的社会主义生活。列宁烂灿的革命理论和列宁及斯大林关于共产主义的学说，武装着这些国家的工人阶级先锋队。资本主义国家的工人阶级，从他们自身底力量上，从必然能战胜资产阶级一点上，和从胜利的社会主义地域之伟大成就上获得了信心。
    斯大林深刻地分析了列宁主义中所有最重要的问题——无产阶级专政。他指出，无产阶级专政是作为无产阶级革命底工具，是作为无产阶级对资产阶级进行统治底工具，又指出苏维埃政权是无产阶级专政底国家形式。
    斯大林在其对资本主义制度下“纯粹”民主论这种陈腐理论（这个理论今日正为帝国主义奴仆右翼社会党领袖们所宣传着）的猛烈抨击中，他指出，资本主义制度下的民主乃是少数剥削者对多数被剥削者的专政。只有在无产阶级民主之下，被剥削者才有可能享受真正自由。无产者和农民才有可能去真正参加国家管理。在无产阶级专政下，真正民主的最好榜样就是群众本身底直接组织苏维埃，这是最民主的同时也是群众底最有威信的组织，这组织能尽量便利群众去参加新国家的建设和管理。
    列宁——斯大林底无产阶级专政理论有着伟大的国际意义。这是工人阶级先锋队以及工人阶级党在其为夺取政权和为争取社会主义斗争时所掌握着的有力的思想武器。无产阶级专政理论的真理及其力量的决定性的证明，就是在人民民主国家正在建设着社会主义，在那里人民民主国家正在执行着无产阶级专政的职能。在人民民主国家建设社会主义的领导力量是工人阶级。叛徒铁托集团一旦抛弃了无产阶级专政原则，资产阶级制度立即就在南斯拉夫复辟了。
    在“论列宁主义基础”中，斯大林分析并发展了列宁底关于农民问题和民族问题的思想。斯大林强调，虽然农民问题在列宁主义中有其巨大的重要性，但这在列宁主义中并不是主要的东西。斯大林接下去强调，农民问题，作为无产阶级在其为夺取政权而斗争时的同盟者问题，是一个派生的问题。列宁主义的基本问题，列宁主义底出发点，是关于无产阶级专政，是关于争取和巩固无产阶级专政的条件的问题。但是，农民问题是无产阶级专政这个总问题中的一部份，所以依旧是列宁主义最紧要的问题之一。
    民族问题在列宁主义中有着极端重要性。“论列宁主义基础”中有关这问题的章节，是斯大林在十月革命前所写的著作底发展，同时又是列宁理论的进一步发展。我们不难正确地估计那予民族问题以深刻分析的列宁与斯大林著作的国际理论的与实践意义。在苏联，复杂的民族问题业已辉煌地予以解决，无可置疑的证据就是：苏联各族人民的友谊已成为苏维埃人民的动力之一。列宁——斯大林底民族问题的理论对世界各国工人阶级及其政党是一个指导原则。在人民民主国家，民族问题正基于列宁——斯大林底方针完满地解决着。
    从帝国主义时代解决民族问题这个前提出发，列宁提出：被压迫民族反对帝国主义与争取真正的民族平等真正的国家独立存在的斗争，必须予以经常支援。斯大林特别强调，必须对各主要国家内部的那些“社会主义者”底帝国主义沙文主义分子们的思想进行坚决斗争，他们不需要反对本国的帝国主义政府，也不愿帮助殖民地被压迫民族为求解放而争取国家独立的斗争。
    无庸证明，今天，斯大林在他底演讲“论列宁主义基础”中所发展的，关于民族问题的课题是怎样适合时宜。美帝国主义在其征服世界的进军中，加紧镇压和奴役其他各国人民，剥夺他们底独立与主权。列宁——斯大林关于民族问题的课题揭穿了这个帝国主义者的大国沙文主义及其种族“理论”，他们今天所宣传的世界主义，就是战争贩子狭隘的沙文主义的反面。
    斯大林书中有关战略与策略的部分，是列宁关于这问题的思想底创造的进一步发展。斯大林指出，战略与策略底无比重要就在于它是领导无产阶级斗争的科学。斯大林关于战略与策略所有主要问题的丰富分析，是加进马克思列宁主义宝库的珍贵贡献，是世界各国共产党在其为战胜帝国主义而斗争时行动的指南。布尔什维克底战略与策略乃是所有工人阶级党的模范。
    在“论列宁主义基础”中，斯大林对列宁关于党的学说作出了详尽的理论根据，这个学说对世界各国共产党乃是行动的步骤与指南。斯大林郑重论列了新型党底下列特征：党——是工人阶级以革命理论武装起来的先锋队；党——是工人阶级底政治领袖，工人阶级的总参谋部；党——是工人阶级底有组织的部队；党——是无产阶级专政底工具；党——是意志底统一，不容有派别组织存在；“党是在清除了自己队伍里的机会主义分子而巩固起来的。”
　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    斯大林底“论列宁主义基础”是创造地发展马克思列宁主义的烂灿典范。这著作以不可动摇的对列宁主义的忠诚来教育共产主义者，在其为共产主义胜利的斗争中鼓舞他们武装他们。在目前情势下，对党的干部进行以马恩列斯学说为基础的思想教育有其特殊重要性。巩固民主阵营全部力量以进行争取世界和平的胜利斗争，这些工作，在今天是无比鲜明的。
    右翼社会党领袖们卑躬曲膝地帮助帝国主义者。各国共产党的重要任务之一就是揭穿他们底背叛阴谋。斯大林底著作，特别是“论列宁主义基础”，在保卫马克斯列宁主义者理论底纯洁性上起着重要作用。这著作以社会生活规律的知识武装世界各国无产阶级，在他们为争取和平民主和社会主义的斗争中激励他们。
