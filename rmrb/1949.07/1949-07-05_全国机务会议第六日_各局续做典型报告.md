　　Sixth Day of the National Machine Affairs Conference
  　Various Bureaus Continue to Make Typical Reports
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The National Machine Affairs Conference entered its sixth day on July 3rd, continuing with typical reports from the machine affairs sections of various bureaus. In the morning, Chen Zhijiu, a first-class labor hero from the Meihekou Machine Affairs Section of the Jilin Railway Bureau, reported that when they were rushing to repair the scaffolding inside the Tuoyaoling Mountain cave, which had been bombed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, they created model tools and quickly completed the railway track scaffolding, completing a month and a half's worth of work in twenty-seven days. After the implementation of the new traffic system, because the section had too few vehicles and some locomotives had not been repaired after exceeding three B-level inspections, causing leaks in the locomotive tanks. Chen Zhijiu took the initiative to propose improving the quality of the tanks. Locomotives repaired by them burned well, saved coal, and no longer had problems. Chen Zhijiu enthusiastically trained apprentices, and four workers trained by him have now passed the third-class riveter exam. Cao Rongsheng, a representative from the Handan-Shexian Railway of the Zhengzhou Bureau, vividly introduced the situation of constructing and repairing the line from Handan to Shexian. They改造 (gaizao - reformed/remodelled) dilapidated locomotives,改造 (gaizao - reformed/remodelled) air brakes, and improved the quality of axles, fully demonstrating the great creativity of the working class. With the help of the broad masses of farmers, difficulties such as sleepers, steel rails, and ballast were resolved. In the afternoon, Wang Diankun, a representative from the inspection section of the Northeast Qiqihar Bureau, reported that since the section implemented the train inspection responsibility system, it immediately reduced the number of missed inspections and shortened the vehicle downtime. For example, the number of missed inspection accidents in March this year was 31, which was reduced to 12 in May. In May, the number of train inspections implemented by the station was 172, and the number of vehicle repairs implemented was reduced to 78, which is a smaller percentage than the 220 vehicles from the past major repair train inspections. Regarding the achievements of passenger car chartering, not only are they responsible for the chartering and riding, but they also do C-level inspections and passenger car water supply preparation. According to statistics for February and March alone, each group completed 224 C-level inspections and repairs, saving 535.2 hours and improving quality. Yang Peilin, a representative from the Ningnian Water Supply Station of the Qi Bureau, reported that after they implemented the division of labor responsibility system, the efficiency of machine and coal saving was improved. Major repairs that were not possible or understood during the Japanese era are now learned by them. Because of their good performance, they were assigned by the Administration Bureau to help with repairs at nearby water supply stations. The efficiency of the water pumps repaired by them has been improved. For example, before the Jiangqiao Water Supply Station was repaired, the water output was 25 tons per hour, which increased to 37 tons per hour after the repair. Chen Daxian, an engineer from the Pingjin Bureau, reviewed the old work style of engineers being detached from the masses in his report. He believes that in order to truly serve the people today, it is necessary to completely change the old work attitude, learn from the workers, and combine intellectual and physical labor in order to transform oneself.

　　全国机务会议第六日
  　各局续做典型报告
    【本报讯】七月三日全国机务会议进入第六日，继续进行各局机务段的典型报告。上午吉林铁路局梅河口机务段一等劳动英雄陈志久报告他们在抢修被国民党反动派所炸坏的驼腰岭山洞里的棚架时，创造模型工具，迅速搞好铁轨棚架，使一个半月的工作二十七天就提前完成。新行车制实行后，因该段车少不够用，有的机车超过了三个乙检还没空修理，造成机车罐部泄漏的毛病。陈志久主动提出要提高罐部质量的工作，凡经过他们修理后的机车，好烧又省煤，再不发生毛病了。陈志久热心带徒弟，经过他培养的四个工人，现在已考上了三等铆工匠。郑州局邯涉铁路代表曹荣生生动地介绍了修筑与修复邯郸到涉县线路的情形，他们改造破烂机车，改造风闸，提高车轴质量，充分表现了工人阶级的伟大创造力。因为有广大农民帮助，解决了枕木、钢轨、道碴等困难。下午东北齐哈局检车段代表王殿琨报告，自该段实行列车检查负责制以来，立刻就减少不漏检及缩短休车率的成效。如今年三月份发生漏检事故为三十一件到五月份就减为十二件。五月份该站列检施行辆数是一百七十二，修车施行辆数就减少到七十八，其百分比较过去大修列检施行辆数少二百二十。关于客车包车成绩，不仅管包乘，还要兼做丙检和客车给水整备，仅以二、三月份的统计各组作的丙检及修缮二百二十四辆，就节省了五三五点二小时，并提高了质量。齐局宁年给水所的代表杨沛林报告他们实行分工负责制以后，机器与煤的节省效率都提高了，过去日本时代所不会的、不懂的大修现在他们都学会了。因为他们成绩好，由管理局指派到附近给水所去帮助检修，凡经过他们检修的扬水机，效率都提高了。如江桥给水所未修前，扬水量每小时为二十五吨，经检修每小时增至三十七吨。平津局工程师陈大铣在报告中检讨了过去工程师脱离群众的旧作风后，他认为在今天要真正为人民服务只有彻底改变过去旧的工作态度，好好向工人学习，把智力劳动和体力劳动结合起来才能改造自己。
