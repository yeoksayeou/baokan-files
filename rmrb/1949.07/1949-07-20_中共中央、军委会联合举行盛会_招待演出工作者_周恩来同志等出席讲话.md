    [Broadcast from Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Beiping, July 19th dispatch: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission jointly held a grand reception this afternoon to entertain all the literary and art workers who participated in the performances of the Literary and Art Congress, including literary and art troupes and drama troupes from various field armies, the Inner Mongolia Cultural Work Troupe, drama troupes and cultural work troupes from various liberated areas, as well as figures from the Peking opera and Quyi (folk art forms) circles, totaling more than two thousand people. Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee, Fu Zhong, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Commission, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Literary and Art Congress, and Mao Dun spoke at the meeting. They unanimously praised the achievements of the literary and art workers on the literary and art front and their contributions to the revolution, and hoped that they would continue to work hard for the people and more humbly study revolutionary theory, Communist Party policies, and literary and art techniques. Finally, when Vice Chairman of the Military Commission Zhou Enlai spoke, the whole audience burst into extremely warm applause. Vice Chairman Zhou recounted the glorious achievements of the People's Liberation Army and the developing situation of the revolutionary victory. He hoped that the literary and art workers of the troops would advance with the troops; literary and art workers in the rear of the liberated areas should further develop and strengthen their ranks. He also hoped that the old artists would transform themselves well and serve the people.

    Since the "May Fourth" Movement, the Chinese New Literature and Art Movement has lasted for thirty years and has played a great role in the people's revolutionary struggle. Especially after the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942, Chinese literary and art workers, especially literary and art workers in the liberated areas, began to integrate with the broad masses of the people. The experience of these years has proved the remarkable foresight and correctness of Chairman Mao's literary and art policy. The result of the integration of literary and art workers with the working people has brought a new look to Chinese literature and art. We thank Chairman Mao for his concern and leadership of literature and art. In the future, we must continue to implement this policy and further integrate with the broad masses of the people, with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only by first learning from the masses of the people can we educate the masses of the people. Our work must be tested in the face of the masses of the people.

    We must strengthen learning and self-criticism. Since our literature and art are to serve the people, our goal is to enable the people to achieve victory and consolidate victory. A true patriotic and democratic writer and artist worthy of the name must grasp the correct worldview and outlook on life. Only in this way can he correctly understand the class relations of Chinese society, express the new heroic figures and heroic deeds among the Chinese people, and only then can his works be rich in ideological content and effectively and correctly serve the people and promote the great educational effectiveness of literature and art.

    We know that our task is arduous, and our work is responsible to the people. Therefore, we can only closely connect with the masses, learn with an open mind, and work hard, so as not to fail the ardent expectations of the people of the whole country.
    
    Let the patriotic and democratic literary and art workers of the whole country unite closely, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and together with the people of the whole country, strive for the construction of the People's Republic and the construction of people's literature and art!

    中共中央、军委会联合举行盛会
    招待演出工作者
    周恩来同志等出席讲话
    【北平新华广播电台广播】北平十九日消息：中国共产党中央委员会和中国人民革命军事委员会，今天下午联合举行盛大的招待会，招待这次参加文代会演出工作的全体文艺工作者，计有各野战军的文艺工作团、剧团，内蒙文工团，各解放区剧团、文工团，以及国剧曲艺界人士，一共两千多人。在会上讲话的有中共中央宣传部部长陆定一、军委政治部副部长傅钟、文代会主席郭沫若和茅盾，他们一致称赞各位文艺工作者在文艺战线上的成绩和对革命的贡献，希望他们再努力的为人民工作，更虚心的学习革命理论、共产党政策和文艺技术。最后当军委副主席周恩来讲话的时候，全场掌声异常热烈。周副主席讲述了人民解放军的光辉战绩和革命胜利发展的形势，他希望部队的文艺工作者，要跟着部队向前进；解放区后方的文艺工作者，要更加发展壮大自己的队伍。他还希望旧艺人要好好改造自己，为人民服务。
    从“五四”以来，中国新文艺运动已历时三十年了，在人民革命斗争中起了很大的作用。特别是一九四二年毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以后，中国的文艺工作者，尤其是解放区的文艺工作者开始和广大的人民群众相结合。这些年的经验证明了毛主席文艺方针的卓越的预见与正确。文艺工作者和劳动人民结合的结果，使中国的文学艺术的面貌焕然一新。我们感谢毛主席对文艺的关心与领导。今后我们要继续贯彻这个方针，更进一步地与广大人民、与工农兵相结合。只有首先向人民群众学习了，才有可能教育人民群众。我们的工作，必须在人民群众的面前取得考验。
    我们要加强学习与自我批评，我们的文学艺术既然是为人民服务的，我们的目的也就是使人民能取得胜利与巩固胜利。一个名符其实的真正爱国的民主的文学家与艺术家，就必须掌握正确的世界观与人生观，只有这样，他才有可能正确的了解中国社会的阶级关系，表现中国人民中新的英雄人物与英雄事迹，也才有可能使自己的作品富有思想性，也才有可能有效地正确地为人民服务，发扬文艺的伟大教育效能。
    我们知道我们的任务是艰巨的，我们的工作是对人民负责的。因此，我们只有密切联系群众，虚心学习，努力工作，才不致辜负全国人民对于我们的热望。
    全国爱国的民主的文学艺术工作者紧密地团结起来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导之下，和全国人民一起，为人民共和国的建设与人民文学艺术的建设而奋斗！
              中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会
              一九四九年七月十九日
