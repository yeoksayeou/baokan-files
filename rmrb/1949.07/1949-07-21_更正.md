　　Correction
    In the fourth paragraph, third line of the article "Resolution on Establishing the Communist Youth League in the Army" on page two of this newspaper on the 17th, the phrase "respond to the call of the Revolutionary Military Commission" is a mistake for "respond to the call of the Revolutionary Servicemen's Committee."
    According to a telegram from the Propaganda Department of the Literary Congress, in the "List of Members of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles Committee" published on page one of this newspaper on the 20th, after Liu Yazi, the following should be added: "(There are still eight members from the to-be-liberated areas, and the Congress authorized the Standing Committee to appoint them)"; in the second paragraph of the "Congress Declaration," "literary revolution" in "Mao Dun and Zhou Yang's report on the literary revolution movement in the Kuomintang reactionary ruling area and the literary movement in the liberated area" should be "revolutionary literature." We hereby make these corrections.

　　更正
    十七日本报二版“关于在部队中建团的决议”文内第四条第四段第三行“响应革命军事委员会的号召”为“响应革命军人委员会的号召”之误。
    据文代大会宣传处来电，二十日本报一版刊载“全国文联委员会委员名单”中，柳亚子之后，应加“（还留有待解放区八名委员，大会授权常务委员会聘请）”；“大会宣言”第二段中“茅盾、周扬关于国民党反动派统治区文艺革命运动与解放区文艺运动的报告”中的“文艺革命”，应为“革命文艺”。特此更正。
