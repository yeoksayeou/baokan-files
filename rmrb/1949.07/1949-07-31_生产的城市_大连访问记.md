　　The City of Production - A Visit to Dalian
　　Zhang Pei

　　In early June, this reporter visited the Lushun-Dalian area. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the friendly assistance of the Soviet garrison in Lushun, as well as learning from advanced Soviet experience, many New Democratic construction projects have achieved outstanding success in this region.

　　I. The Right Path and Detours

　　The road to building a new Lushun-Dalian was not smooth and unobstructed.

　　On May 13, 1906, Japanese invaders occupied the Liaodong Peninsula. In nearly forty years, they drained countless amounts of blood and sweat from the Chinese people. For example, after the September 18th Incident, every year ten million tons of soybeans, coal, iron, timber... from the Northeast were shipped out by the Japanese as capital to invade China and the people of Asia.

　　On August 22, 1945, the heroic Soviet Red Army, along with the liberation of the entire Northeast, liberated this land. The imperialist economic system was destroyed, and the people of Lushun-Dalian began to become masters of their own destiny. However, just as the people were starting construction on the ruins left by the Japanese invaders' war, they encountered the economic blockade implemented by the Kuomintang reactionaries at the instigation of American imperialism. At that time, the difficulties were very serious. There was an extreme shortage of food. Almost all factories were shut down due to a lack of raw materials and markets. All workers and staff were unemployed. Tens of thousands of peddlers and nearly a thousand speculative agencies disrupted the city's economic life.

　　How to begin changing this difficult picture? Unfortunately, we took a detour at the beginning. In the early days of liberation, we moved the methods of conducting mass movements in the countryside to the city, using great effort to carry out liquidation struggles, allocating enemy and puppet land in the suburbs to the city's workers, distributing houses to some street residents, and organizing several distributions of relief grain. Although all of these measures solved some of the immediate needs of the masses and left a good impression on the people by housing 13,000 worker and poor families in Western-style buildings, they failed to solve the fundamental problems that the city needed to address. Later, we put forward the policy of "organizing production, self-reliance, and overcoming difficulties," but we failed to implement this policy well based on the characteristics of Lushun-Dalian itself, and mainly organized sideline industries, such as manure cooperatives and pancake cooperatives. This was naturally not a fundamental solution to the problem. After learning from many factual lessons, we grasped the central link in October 1947, which was: relying on the working class to restore and develop industrial production and rebuild the city's economy, thereby stabilizing the people's lives.

　　At this time, some of the Sino-Soviet joint venture factories had already started operating, and other state-owned factories, under decentralized management, were also starting to recover. The reason why these state-owned factories were able to recover relatively quickly was that the Soviet military authorities helped guard the factories, which allowed us to utilize the original production facilities to restore and transform production at the beginning of the takeover. We tried our best to maintain the integrity of all enterprise organizations serving production; we tried not to dismiss factory employees as much as possible, and if they had to be dismissed due to a short-term inability to resume work, we registered them so that they could be easily found when work resumed; the factory's or company's raw materials were not used indiscriminately, and these materials were used immediately to restore production, restoring as much as possible; factories supported factories—using existing raw materials for production, paying wages and purchasing raw materials with the finished products; and then cleaned up warehouses, collected equipment, mobilized workers to donate voluntarily, and mobilized scattered workers to return to the factory in order to quickly move towards a normal state of production.

　　In this process, two problems arose: One was whether to simply provide relief to those workers who were temporarily unemployed because they were unable to resume production in the short term or could only resume partial production, or to organize them to implement self-reliance through production. The Lushun-Dalian People's Government adopted the latter approach and, with the help of the Soviet army, established a fishing net factory employing more than 30,000 people and a handmade shoe factory employing more than 30,000 people. These handmade factories did solve the serious unemployment problem at the time before industrial production was restored (each person received 16 kilograms of grain per month, which was actually equivalent to relief); and through production, these unemployed workers were organized and given political education (because there were not enough raw materials for production, they worked half a day and studied half a day). At the same time, it also played the role of organizing a labor reserve. As industry gradually recovered, these workers were introduced to various factories according to their skills.

　　The other question was whether to improve the workers' lives first and then talk about increasing production in the factories that had already resumed work, or to gradually improve the lives of the workers in a planned way while increasing production. On this issue, the Sino-Soviet joint venture factories, which were operated with the participation of Soviet personnel, adopted the method of first expanding the employment base, absorbing a large labor force, participating in production, and increasing wealth, and then improving the living standards of the workers. Therefore, as early as April 1947, a reasonable seven-level wage system was implemented, opposing egalitarianism in wage issues. On the basis of the seven-level basic wage, a progressive bonus wage system and a piece-rate wage system to stimulate production were gradually and universally implemented, and a plan to improve the lives of workers was formulated at the same time as the production plan. In the state-owned factories that we operated independently, due to the existence of economism and egalitarianism among some people, they only wanted to improve the lives of the workers immediately. In 1947, when economic conditions were at their most difficult, wages were set very high, without focusing primarily on restoring and expanding production. As a result, after more than two years, the production efficiency of the Sino-Soviet joint ventures was very high, and the workers' lives were also managed best, while we took another detour. Only after accepting the lessons of this fact, absorbing the experience of the Sino-Soviet joint venture factories, promoting the economic accounting system, determining production quotas, and drawing up cost plans, so that factory operations truly embarked on enterprise management, did a new atmosphere emerge in production.

　　II. Everything Revolves Around Industrial Production

　　In order to develop urban production in a planned way, Dalian has done a lot of work in industrial and commercial management and taxation. Their basic principle is to protect and reward industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, especially the development of industry; to restrict or help those industries that are illegitimate or have no way out to change their business; to ban those that are harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood; and to appropriately lower commercial profits and increase industrial profits. The achievements in this area are significant. Taking 1948 as an example, the number of industrial households increased by 15.3% compared to 1947, while the production of tobacco, alcohol, cosmetics, and superstitious items decreased by 3.7%, and peddlers decreased by 31.8% compared to 1947.

　　When urban production has not recovered and the broad masses have not found employment, the abnormal "prosperity" of peddlers will inevitably appear, and merchants will also take the opportunity to break up into small units to speculate. In Dalian, at the beginning of liberation, the number of peddlers reached as many as 80,000, distributed on more than 150 streets throughout the city, which not only affected the city's appearance but also disturbed the entire market every day. These peddlers regarded speculation and profiteering as their means of living, which influenced workers in employment who did not want to work in factories with peace of mind. In May 1947, Dalian carried out the first peddler rectification, first organizing a large number of work teams to cooperate with public security organs to conduct investigations, mobilizing all those who originally had shops to move back, and the government rented houses for those who did not have shops, and persuaded more than 700 households to change their business. After this rectification, the number of peddlers was reduced to 9,000 households. In the winter of 1947, factories resumed work one after another, and urban construction had also begun. More stringent measures were taken to rectify peddlers. The government decided to remove several major concentrations of peddlers, persuaded peddlers to demolish wooden houses and move into booths built by the government in appropriate locations, and carried out business registration and issued business licenses to each household. As a result, more than 2,000 households moved into markets designated by the government, and more than 200 households moved into individual houses rented by the government. In this way, several large open-air peddler markets were banned. Later, a third and fourth rectification were carried out. After these four rectifications, there are currently only 5,000 peddlers and merchants left, of which only 800 to 1,000 are young adults aged 18 to 44. Most of the others who used to work or young people with labor are converted to work in factories. The reason why the work of rectifying peddlers can achieve results is that it is carried out in conjunction with the process of production recovery and development, rather than being solved in isolation.

　　In order to promote the development of production, Lushun-Dalian implemented currency reform at the end of 1948. The basic principles of this currency reform were to guarantee the interests of all working people and public employees, as well as the legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen, and to crack down on speculators who possessed large amounts of floating capital and engaged in speculation and profiteering activities that disrupted production. The specific measures were that anyone belonging to one of the following items could exchange old currency for new currency at a ratio of one to one (others were ten yuan of old currency for one yuan of new currency): (1) Workers, staff, and foreign citizens currently in government agencies, mass organizations, public and private enterprises are allowed to exchange 5,000 yuan of new currency per person; (2) Farmers are allowed to exchange 5,000 yuan of new currency per household; (3) Handicraft workers, merchants, and others are allowed to exchange 5,000 yuan of new currency per household head, but individual handicraft (such as fishing net factories, shoe-making factories) and industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood with the approval of the Guandong Public Office can exchange their cash for new currency at a ratio of one to one, but only to the extent of the transaction amount reported to the government when paying taxes in the first half of the month before the currency reform was implemented. The result of the currency reform was that, in addition to absorbing a large amount of floating capital that was causing trouble in the market by banks, it also promoted the decline in prices, which in effect increased the living standards of wage earners and public employees, protected the interests of farmers and legitimate industrialists and businessmen, greatly increased the value of Guandong currency, and promoted economic development.

　　At the same time as restoring and developing production, Dalian's cooperative business has also achieved great development. When production had not yet recovered in 1946, Dalian only had two cooperatives (namely, pancake cooperatives and manure cooperatives), with 740 members and 2,645,000 yuan of Guandong currency. In the first half of 1949, it increased to 69, with 78,265 members (accounting for one-third of the city's population) and 203,466,000 yuan of funds. The main participants in the cooperatives are workers and public employees, followed by urban poor. The business of these cooperatives is to promote the sale of products from state-owned enterprises, engage in grain processing, directly purchase vegetables, fish, meat, and fruits from small producers, distribute them to members, and promote daily necessities produced by private factories, ensuring the low-price supply of consumer goods for workers, thereby avoiding the intermediate exploitation of merchants and increasing the purchasing power of the masses.

　　In addition, Dalian also rectified speculative agencies, mobilized and organized them to switch to legitimate overseas trade. The civil affairs and public security departments of the People's Government combined to systematically eliminate thieves, beggars, and prostitutes left over from the old society. Now there are no beggars on the streets of Dalian, and very few thefts are found on trams and in public places.

　　Dalian's experience tells us that in an industrial city, the work of all departments at all stages must revolve around the central link of restoring and developing the city's industrial production. Only in the production movement can the masses be truly mobilized, organized, and educated, and only on the basis of production development can the lives of the masses be truly improved. The view that it is impossible to mobilize and organize the masses by relying solely on peaceful production without going through a vigorous and lively struggle has been completely proven to be wrong; the view and practice of improving the lives of the masses away from production has also been proven to be completely wrong.

　　III. Overview of the New City

　　In Dalian, as a result of the restoration and development of production, the broad masses have gained employment opportunities. In 1946, there were only 26,000 industrial workers, while now there are nearly 80,000. The total number of wage earners is 150,000, and with an average of one and a half family members per person, a total of 375,000 people rely on wage income to live. Currently, only 3,000 people in Dalian have not found fixed jobs (most of whom lack certain skills), which will also be resolved as production continues to develop. In this way, Dalian has become a truly productive city. The production and labor of the urban people is the new, greatest, and most important feature of Lushun-Dalian.

　　Currently, prices in the Lushun-Dalian area have generally fallen. Compared with the highest prices in 1947, grain prices have fallen to one-sixth of the original price. And due to the widespread implementation of the progressive bonus and piece-rate wage system, the actual wages of employees have increased by an average of one time compared with the most difficult period in 1947. Therefore, people's lives have been significantly improved. With the development of the economy and the improvement of living standards, the masses' demand for learning culture and technology has generally increased. Recently, the Lushun-Dalian Administrative Office has set a plan to eliminate illiteracy among 300,000 people in the entire region within two years, and it is estimated that this plan can be realized early. Currently, all employees and public employees in Lushun-Dalian have two hours of political, cultural, and technical learning outside of working hours. Groups of employees and women enter night schools or training classes from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM every day. Their learning content and learning organization forms are extremely lively. In addition to general cadres focusing on political learning, others focus on cultural technology, but they are all closely integrated with production and politics. The party, government, trade union, youth league, women's federation, and Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations in Lushun-Dalian use these occasions to carry out their work or activities. The improvement of the lives of the broad masses and the widespread and enthusiastic participation in the learning movement are the second characteristic of Lushun-Dalian.

　　Through production - through the widespread and extensive learning movement, the broad masses have been mobilized and organized. In any gathering, parade, or even the commuting of employees and public employees in Dalian, everything is in order, and very few scattered people are seen. Activities are collective, public facilities and welfare undertakings are collective, and even the lives and residences of the broad masses of employees and teaching staff (such as workers' homes, cultural centers for educators, etc.) are collective. This is the third characteristic of Dalian.

　　The entire Lushun-Dalian has a population of nearly one million. Apart from 450,000 farmers, the remaining population is mainly concentrated in Dalian City and Dalian County. According to recent statistics, among the 150,000 wage earners (including public employees and public security police) in Dalian, nearly 80,000 are industrial workers and more than 30,000 are handicraft workers who make fishing nets. Women account for 28% of all employees. Women's participation in labor has become another new feature of Dalian. Not only do light industrial factories have a large number of female workers, but there are also female drivers who operate streetcars freely, which have been trained in the past two years. As women show their great role in economic life, their status has also greatly improved in various activities.

　　A stranger who has just arrived in Dalian, when he steps out of the magnificent Far East famous station and walks towards the city, if it is not Sunday or a holiday, he will find that in this famous port city, on such wide and flat roads with lush street trees and modern buildings on both sides, he cannot see any bustling crowds. The whole city seems to be in silence. But if he has the opportunity to visit those factories with chimneys billowing smoke, schools with spacious and clean buildings, and offices of various agencies and organizations, he will find that people are working, working, and learning tensely, and idlers are already very rare here.

　　生产的城市——大连访问记
    张沛
    六月初，记者访问了旅顺大连地区。这个地区在中国共产党领导下，由于旅顺苏联驻军的友谊帮助，以及学习了苏联的先进经验，许多新民主主义的建设事业得到了优越的成就。
　　一、正途与弯路
    建设新旅大的道路并不是平坦无阻的。
    一九○六年五月十三日，日本侵略者占领了辽东半岛。在近四十年中，他们不知吸去了多少中国人民的血汗。如在九一八后，每年即有一千万吨东北的大豆、煤、铁、林木……，被日本人从这里运出去，作为侵略中国和亚洲人民的资本。
    一九四五年八月二十二日，英勇的苏联红军与解放全东北同时解放了这块土地。帝国主义的经济体系被摧毁了，旅大人民开始成为自己命运的主宰者。但当人民刚刚由日本侵略者战争破坏的废墟上着手建设时，又遇到了美帝国主义唆使国民党反动派所实行的经济封锁。当时，困难是很严重的，粮食极端缺乏，几乎全部工厂都因为没有原料和销路而陷于停顿，全部工人职员处在失业状态中；数万人的摊贩群，和近千家的投机性代理店，搅乱着城市的经济生活。
    如何着手改变这幅艰难的图景呢？不幸我们在一开始就走了弯路。在解放初期，我们把在农村中进行群众运动的一套方式搬到城市中来，用很大力量去搞清算斗争，给城市的工人分配市郊的敌伪土地，给一些街道的居民分房子，并组织发放了几次救济粮。所有这些，虽然也解决了一部分群众眼前的需要，并使一万三千户工人贫民住上了洋楼，曾给人民留下了好印象。但却没有能够解决城市所需要解决的根本问题。以后，我们就提出了“组织生产，自力更生，克服困难”的方针，但又未能很好地根据旅大城市本身的特点来执行这一方针，而主要地只是组织了副业生业，如大粪合作社、煎饼合作社等。这自然还不是解决问题的根本办法。在经过许多事实的教训之后，到了一九四七年十月才抓住了中心环子，这就是：依靠工人阶级，恢复和发展工业生产，重建城市的经济，从而安定人民的生活。
    这时，中苏合营工厂，已有一部分早已开工；另一部分公营工厂，在分散经营的状态下，也着手恢复。这些公营工厂之所以能够较快地恢复，是由于苏军当局帮助看守了工厂，这样使得我们在接收之初，即可利用原有生产机构恢复和改造生产。我们对于一切为生产服务的企业机构都尽可能地保持它的完整性；对工厂职工尽可能不加遣散，如因短期无法复工必须遣散时，亦进行登记，以备在复工时便于找回；工厂或公司的原材料都不乱用，立即利用这些材料恢复生产，能恢复多少即恢复多少；以厂养厂——以现有原料生产，拿生产成品开付工资和购买原料；并随即清理仓库，收集器材发动工人自动献纳，动员零散工人回厂，以便迅速地走向正常的生产状态。
    在这一过程中，发生了两个问题：一个是：对于那些因短时无法恢复生产或只能局部恢复生产而暂时失业的工人，是单纯地给以救济呢，还是把他们组织起来实行生产自救呢？旅大人民政府采取了后者，在苏军的帮助下，成立了包括三万多人的渔网工厂，建立了三万多人的手工制鞋工厂。这些手工工厂在工业生产未恢复前，确实解决了当时严重的失业问题（每人每月发十六公斤粮食，实际等于救济）；并通过生产把这些失业工人组织起来，进行了政治教育（因为生产原料不够，每天半日劳动，半日学习），同时它又起了组织劳动后备军的作用。当工业逐步恢复时，这些工人也就依其技术被分别介绍到各个工厂去了。
    另一个问题是：在那些已经复工的工厂是先改善工人生活，再谈提高生产呢，还是从提高生产中有计划地逐步改善工人群众的生活呢？在这个问题上，当时在苏联人员参加经营的中苏合营的工厂中，是采取先扩大就业面，吸收广大的劳动大军，参加生产，增加财富，从而再做到提高工人的生活水平的办法。所以，早在一九四七年四月，就实行了合理的七级工资制，反对了在工资问题上的平均主义。在七级的基本工资的基础上，有步骤地普遍实行了刺激生产的超额累进奖励工资制和计件工资制，并与制订生产计划同时定出改善工人生活的计划。而在我们单独经营的公营工厂中，由于某些人存在一种经济主义和平均主义思想，一心只想立时改善工人生活，在经济条件最困难的一九四七年，把工资订得很高，而没有把注意力主要地集中于恢复和扩大生产。结果，经过两年多的时间，中苏合营企业的生产效率是很高的，工人生活也是管理得最好的而我们则又走了一次弯路。只在接受了这个事实的教训，吸取中苏合营工厂的经验，推行经济核算制度，确定生产定额，订出成本计划，使工厂经营真正走上企业化以后，生产上才出现了新的气象。
　　二、一切环绕着工业生产
    为了有计划地发展城市的生产，大连在工商管理与税收方面作了很多工作。它们的基本原则是保护和奖励有利于国计民生的工商业，特别是工业的发展；对于非正当的或没有出路的工业则予以限制或助其转业；对于有害于国计民生者，则予以取缔；并适当压低商业利润，提高工业利润。这一方面所获得的成绩是显著的。以一九四八年为例：工业户数较一九四七年增加了百分之一五·三，烟、酒、化妆、迷信品的生产则缩小了百分之三·七，摊贩较一九四七年减少了百分之三一·八。
    在城市的生产没有恢复，广大群众没有就业时，必然会出现摊贩的畸形“繁荣”，商人也乘机化整为零，投机取巧。大连初解放时摊贩曾达到八万人之多，分布在全市一百五十余条街道上，不仅影响市容，而且每天搅动着整个市场，这些摊贩把投机牟利当成生活的依靠，影响在业工人不愿安心在工厂做工。一九四七年五月，大连进行了第一次摊贩整理，首先组织大批的工作队配合公安机关进行调查，动员原来有铺面的一律迁回，没有门面的则由政府租给房屋，并说服七百余户改业。经过这次整理，摊贩减到九千户。一九四七年冬工厂陆续复工，城市建设也已开始，整顿摊贩就采取了比较严格的办法，政府决定清除几个主要的摊贩集中地，说服摊贩拆除木板房，迁入政府在适当地点建筑的摊亭，并逐户进行营业登记，发给营业执照。结果，有二千多户迁进政府指定的市场，二百多户迁进政府租给的单个房屋。这样，几个大的露天摊贩市场就被取缔掉了。以后又进行了第三次和第四次整理。经过这四次整理，目前摊贩行商已只剩五千人，其中十八岁到四十四岁的青壮年只有八百人至一千人，其余过去曾经做过工的，或者青年有劳动力的，大多已转业到工厂做工了。整理摊贩工作的所以能得到成绩，是因为它是结合着生产的恢复和发展的过程进行，而不是孤立地解决。
    为了促进生产的发展，旅大在一九四八年底实行了币制改革。这次币改的基本原则是保证全体劳动人民和公教人员的利益，以及正当工商业者的利益，给拥有大批游资进行投机倒把活动破坏生产者以打击。具体办法是，凡属下列各项之一者得以一比一的比值以旧币兑换新币（其他人等则为旧币十元兑新币一元）：（一）现在政府机关、群众团体、公私企业的工人、职员及外国公民，每人准兑新币五千元；（二）农民每户准兑新币五千元；（三）手工业者、商人及其他，每一户主准兑五千元，但经关东公署批准之个别有利于国计民生之手工业（如渔网工厂、作鞋工厂）和工商企业，可将其现款以一比一之比值兑新币，但以其在实行币改的前半月向政府纳税时所报之交易额为限。币改的结果，除将兴风作浪捣乱市场的游资大量由银行加以吸收外，并促进了物价的下跌，这样就在实际上提高了薪资劳动者与公教人员的生活，保障了农民与正当工商业者的利益，大大地提高了关东币价值，促进了经济的发展。
    与恢复和发展生产同时，大连的合作事业也获得了很大的发展。当一九四六年生产尚未恢复时，大连仅有合作社两个（即煎饼合作社与大粪合作社），社员七四○人，资金二、六四五、○○○元关东币。一九四九年上半年增加到六十九个，社员七八、二六五人（占全市人口三分之一），资金二○三、四六六、○○○元。参加合作社的主要是工人和公教人员，其次是城市贫民。这些合作社的业务是推销公营企业的商品，经营粮米加工业务，直接自小生产者之手购买青菜、鱼、肉、果品，分配给社员及推销私营工厂所出的日用必需品，保证了劳动者消费品的低价供给，从而避免了商人的中间剥削，提高了群众的购买力。
    此外，大连还整理了投机性代理店，发动和组织他们转营正当的海外贸易。人民政府的民政和公安部门结合，有计划地清除了旧社会遗留下的小偷、乞丐、妓女。现在大连的街上已看不到一个乞丐，在电车上和公共场所中，极少发现被偷现象。
    大连的经验告诉我们：在一个工业城市，一切部门各个时期的工作都必须围绕着恢复和发展城市的工业生产这个中心的一环。只有在生产运动中才能真正发动组织与教育群众，并只有在生产发展的基础上才能真正改善群众的生活。那种认为不经过轰轰烈烈的斗争场面，只靠和平生产是不能发动与组织群众的观点，已经完全被证明是错误的了；那种离开生产去改善群众生活的观点和做法，也同样被证明是完全错误的了。
　　三、新城市的概貌
    在大连，由于生产恢复发展的结果，广大群众已获得就业的机会。一九四六年全部产业工人只有二万六千人，而现在则达到近八万人。全部工薪收入者合计共有十五万人，每人以一个半家属计，则靠工薪收入生活者共为三十七万五千人。目前，大连仅有三千人尚未找到固定职业（其中大部都是无一定技能的），在生产继续发展的情况下，也会得到解决的。这样看来大连已成为一个真正的生产城市。城市人民的生产化和劳动化，这是旅大新的、最大的、也是最主要的特色。
    目前旅大地区物价普遍下跌，比一九四七年物价最高时，粮食下跌为原价六分之一。而由于超额累进奖励和计件工资制的普遍实行，职工的实际工资比一九四七年最艰苦时期平均提高一倍。因此人民生活已获得显著改进。随着经济的发展和生活的改善，广大群众学习文化和技术的要求，已普遍增长。最近旅大行署已定出两年消灭全区三十万文盲的计划，估计这个计划是可以提早实现的。现在旅大的全部职工与公教人员在工作时间外都有两个小时的政治、文化和技术的学习，成群结队的职工和妇女，在每天晚上七时到九时，进入夜校或训练班。他们的学习内容和学习组织形式是极为生动活泼的，除一般干部以政治学习为主外，其他均以文化技术为主——但都密切地与生产和政治相结合。旅大的党、政、职工会、青年团、妇女会、中苏友好协会等组织，就利用这些场合进行自己的工作或活动。广大人民生活改善和普遍而热烈地参加学习运动，这是旅大的第二个特色。
    通过生产——通过普遍而广泛的学习运动，广大的群众就发动起来，组织起来了。在大连市任何一个集会，一次游行，甚至于职工与公教人员们上班下班，都井然有序，很少看到一个一个零散的人。活动都带有集体性，公共的设施和福利事业是集体性的，甚至广大职工和教职人员的生活和居住（如工人之家、教育工作者文化馆等）也是集体的，这是大连市的第三个特色。
    全旅大有近百万人口，除开四十五万农民，其余的人口主要集中于大连市和大连县。据最近的统计，大连十五万工薪收入者（包括公教人员、公安警察在内）中，有近八万的产业工人和三万余制鱼网等手工业工人。在全部职工中，妇女占百分之二十八。妇女参加劳动成为大连另一个新的特色。不仅轻工业工厂拥有大量的女工，就是在电车上也有操纵自如的女司机，这都是最近两年中培养出来的。妇女在经济生活中表现她的巨大作用，在各种活动中她们的地位也大大提高了。
    一个陌生的人刚刚来到大连，当他迈出那宏伟的远东著名的车站走向市区时，假使不是星期日或节日，他会发觉在这个闻名的海港城市中，在这样宽广平坦、街树葱绿、两旁建筑近代化的马路上，竟看不到什么熙攘的人群。整个城市似乎都在静穆中。但如果他有机会访问一下那些烟囱冒着浓烟的工厂，有着宽大整洁的楼房的学校和各个机关团体的办公室，他就会发现人们是在紧张地劳动、工作和学习着，闲人在这里已经是很少了。
