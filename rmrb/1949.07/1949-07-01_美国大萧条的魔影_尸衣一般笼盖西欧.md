　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 30th] TASS, New York: According to a report from a correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune in Paris, senior officials in Paris, London, and other European capitals believe that a crisis has erupted in European economic relations over the past two months. Luo pointed out that the varying degrees of economic unity achieved by the nineteen countries of the Marshall Plan are rapidly collapsing. Luo stated that the breakdown in cooperation is developing into economic relations between the United States and Western Europe, as evidenced by the inability of the Marshall Plan countries themselves, or with the United States, to reach an agreement on how to conduct complex intra-European trade next year. Luo acknowledged that significant disorder has occurred in Anglo-American economic relations. The specter of the American Great Depression is shrouding Europe like a burial shroud. Experts informally agree that the decline of the American economy has become the most important factor in the economic measures of European countries. The drop in American prices, the reduction in trade volume, the reduction in the output of many important industries, the layoffs of workers and the increase in unemployment, etc., have caused fear in Europe. Luo also pointed out that in April, Western European exports to the United States decreased by 25 percent, like a cold rain falling on the hopes of Western European countries for recovery. He also said that, given the current decline in American prices, European industrial products, which are more expensive than American goods, and raw materials obtained from overseas colonies of European countries, are even being driven out of many markets outside the United States.

　　美国大萧条的魔影　尸衣一般笼盖西欧
    美国记者报道
    【新华社北平三十日电】塔斯社纽约讯：据纽约先驱论坛报驻巴黎通讯员某氏报道：巴黎、伦敦与其他欧洲首都的高级官员认为，过去两个月中，欧洲经济关系中业已突发危机。罗氏指出，马歇尔计划十九个国家在经济问题上所达到的不同的统一，正在迅速崩溃中。罗氏称，合作方面的破裂，正发展到美国与西欧间的经济关系上，这可以由马歇尔计划国家自己之间或与美国之间，对于下年如何进行复杂的欧洲内部贸易问题，不能获得协议，得到证明。罗氏承认英美经济关系发生显著的紊乱。美国大萧条的魔影，好象尸衣一般遮盖着欧洲。专家们非正式地同意：美国经济的衰颓，已变成欧洲国家间经济措施中最重要的因素。美国的物价下跌，贸易量的缩减，许多重要工业出产的减少，解雇工人与失业的增加等等现象，已在欧洲引起了恐惧。罗氏又指出：四月份，西欧对美出口减低了百分之二十五，宛如冷的骤雨降在西欧国家的复兴希望上。他又说：按目前美国物价下跌的情况，比美国货要贵的欧洲工业产品以及从欧洲国家的海外殖民地所获得的原料，甚至正被驱逐出美国以外的许多市场。
