    Commemorating Nie Er, the Pioneer of New Music
    Qu Wei
    Nie Er, the standard-bearer and pioneer of the Chinese people's new music, has been gone from us for fourteen years. In these past ten years, China has undergone tremendous changes. The cause for which he fought with the weapon of music has now achieved basic victory. It has special significance to commemorate him today.
    The music movement of the past decade has repeatedly proven to us that Nie Er's path was the correct one. The banner of China's new music can only be him and no one else. Although there have been debates on this issue, some people have evaluated Nie Er from a "purely technical" point of view. They used the naive and ridiculous argument that Nie Er had not received so-called formal music education and did not understand harmony to obliterate his great contribution to the Chinese people. Some people also maliciously said that he was a member of the decadent music school because he had participated in the Mingyue Song and Dance Troupe. However, they did not understand why Nie Er became a pioneer of the times, and why his music became the voice of the Chinese nation. Indeed, if we evaluate him from the traditional old viewpoint, we will not reach the correct conclusion. Nie Er was an ordinary and unremarkable person. He had been a soldier, a shop assistant, and a violinist in the Mingyue Song and Dance Troupe. He did not have the so-called "noble" or legendary experience that people generally imagine a "musician" to have. However, such an ordinary person's career was the beginning of an extraordinary page in Chinese music history.
    Nie Er lived in an era of low pressure. After the failure of the Great Revolution due to the betrayal of the big bourgeoisie, Japanese imperialism took the opportunity to step up its aggression. After the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, the national crisis became increasingly urgent. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries brazenly disregarded the wishes of the entire Chinese people and implemented their reactionary policy of so-called "good-neighbor diplomacy" and "internal pacification before external resistance," applying high pressure to the anti-Japanese national salvation movement of the entire Chinese people. In music, decadent music, as a semi-feudal and semi-colonial ideology, was rampant, indirectly helping the reactionaries of the time to whitewash peace and numb people's consciousness. General music education institutions were still turning around in a replica of the old ways of European and American bourgeois countries. Although some people also wrote some anti-Japanese songs due to the urgency of the national crisis, they disappeared soon because they were not combined with the masses. The broad masses were still under the influence of the old feudal literature and art. Only in the Soviet areas of the land revolution were some revolutionary songs produced with folk songs and foreign introductions; however, due to the "military encirclement and suppression" by the reactionaries and the small area occupied by the Soviet area in the country, this kind of song was isolated from the masses in the vast areas. It can be said that the Chinese music land at that time was a scene of ruins and desolation. But Nie Er appeared before us like a thunderbolt in a cloudy sky, with the posture of a national warrior and a class warrior. He created a brand-new, radiant music that illuminated this desolate ruin and made flowers bloom on the land of Chinese music.
    Nie Er was the first realist composer in China. His works comprehensively depicted the typical emotions of the masses of the people in his era. For many years, the Chinese people had carried out unyielding struggles under the oppression of imperialism and feudalism. But before Nie Er, there had never been a truly fighting music that represented the masses of the people. The songs that were popular during the Great Revolution, such as "Down with the Powers, Eliminate the Warlords," reflected the main political slogans of the time, but the tunes were borrowed from foreign folk songs, and could not typically portray the emotions of the masses at that time. Only in the new music represented by Nie Er can we feel this fighting power. If "La Marseillaise" best expresses the vigorous revolutionary spirit of the French Revolution, then the "March of the Volunteers" (lyrics by Tian Han) is the bugle call of the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. Only in his music can we truly hear the voice of the nation. Here, it is no longer a painful groan, but an angry roar, and a firm confidence in the future of the struggle. No one can deny the fighting role played by his and other writers' songs in the revolutionary movement. At that time, the anti-Japanese national salvation movement was inseparable from opposing the Kuomintang's reactionary policies that hindered the anti-Japanese war. The masses of the people demanded freedom to resist Japan, but the Kuomintang deprived them of this freedom everywhere. Anti-Japanese speech was restricted, and anti-Japanese songs were also among those prohibited. Therefore, singing this kind of song had a dual fighting significance. Just imagine: what a great spirit it was when the marching crowds sang salvation songs, hand in hand, breaking through the police's water dragons, wooden sticks, and machine guns! What a magnificent picture it is when soldiers sing songs and charge forward on the battlefield! The role played by revolutionary songs represented by Nie Er in uniting and educating the masses is incomparable to other kinds of music!
    The music created by Nie Er is music for the masses. He used his practice to oppose the anti-people idealistic viewpoints such as "music is the language of the upper world" and "music is for a few people." Although he was in an area of white terror at the time, isolated from the Soviet area of the land revolution, and it was impossible for him to go further into the masses due to the limitations of the times, nor could he get such clear instructions as Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. But because he was a Communist Party member, under the education of the Party, his creative activities were aimed at the goal of serving the masses. The characters that appear in his songs are the broad masses, mainly the working peasants and workers, such as: "Pioneers" (lyrics by Shi Yi), "The Road Song" (lyrics by Sun Yu), "Dock Workers' Song" (lyrics by Tian Han), etc.; he also wrote about anti-Japanese soldiers, such as "Wounded Soldiers' Song" (lyrics by An E) and "Comfort Song" (lyrics by Tian Han). He chose lyrics that the masses could accept in form and used musical language that was well integrated with the lyrics. In the creative process, he was also good at learning from the masses. It is said that when he was writing "Dock Workers' Song," he ran to the docks on the Huangpu River to listen to the workers' labor shouts, and after writing it, he ran to listen and modify it three or four times. Therefore, his works can be loved by the masses and circulated among the masses. He is a great mass singer who took music from the hands of a few people and handed it over to the masses.
    Based on being faithful to life, Nie Er was also good at critically absorbing Chinese and foreign musical heritage to express the new reality. This kind of creative work gives his works a fresh and lively spirit, and creates a new national form for us. Since Western European music was introduced to China, Chinese music has shown a semi-colonial form, almost becoming an appendage of foreign countries, without its own national characteristics. Although some people have advocated Sinicization, this Sinicization is to absorb things from feudal aristocratic art and turn the wheel backward towards old China; or, like Li Jinhui at that time, although he absorbed things from the people, he catered to the decadent comprador bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois tastes, and was deeply influenced by the rotten capitalist jazz music. Only in Nie Er's music are all kinds of toxins truly eliminated. His practice provides us with a precedent for how to critically absorb heritage. He absorbed the vocabulary of folk music and the method of combining with words, but it is different from the old folk songs, which makes people feel the atmosphere of new real life. He also absorbed things from foreign forms, but it always makes people feel the national characteristics. He is a creative composer who is not bound by conventions. His creed is to faithfully express life, for which he can break all restrictions, and at the same time does not ignore the traditions of his own nation. What he created is the national form of the people who represent the main body of our nation.
    What Nie Er left us are mainly more than 30 mass songs. Some people may think that only symphonies, operas, chamber music, etc. are considered high-level art, and mass songs are insignificant. However, as an advanced warrior of a class, Nie Er focused on how to use music as a weapon of struggle to serve the political tasks of the time; how to convey the fighting emotions of the masses, and in turn encourage the masses to carry out the struggle. Therefore, as long as it can obey such a purpose, any form can be adopted; and the fact proves that mass songs are the best weapon, just like the political short essays adopted by Lu Xun at that time, which are a powerful upper hand. Because mass songs are a comprehensive art of music and poetry, it can concentrate the masses' emotional requirements in music and language, and the combination of the two can complement each other and exert greater effectiveness. The so-called level of artistry is determined by the depth of reality reflected in the work and the degree of processing. Therefore, a symphony with empty form is not necessarily high in artistry; a song that fully reflects the emotions of the masses is not necessarily inferior in artistry. In fact, writing a good mass song is not as simple as people generally imagine. Nie Er's songs are the best example of the combination of music and politics; they are the most able to express the masses and are loved by the masses. Even today, when people mention him, they will say: "If Nie Er is still here, he will definitely write more good songs for us." Although the era expressed by his songs has passed and its combat mission has been completed, it still has a great educational effect on us. In the future, mass singing activities will still be the main aspect of the new music movement.
    Since Nie Er, China's new people's music movement has been around for more than ten years. The road opened up by Nie Er has always been the direction of our progress. Today, this road is getting wider and wider. After defeating the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, China is about to launch a broad revolutionary upsurge of economic construction and cultural construction. The future of new music is very bright. The people have created various favorable conditions for us, and they expect us to create the music of the "historically unprecedented era of the people's power" as Chairman Mao said. Our responsibility is heavy and our work is arduous. We believe that as long as we are good at learning from the people, learning from new things, and learning things we are not familiar with, we will definitely be able to complete this great task.
    Comrades who are engaged in new music work! Unite! Continue to move forward on the road opened up by Nie Er! (Attached photo)

    纪念新音乐的开路先锋——聂耳同志
    瞿维
    中国人民新音乐的旗手，她的开路先锋聂耳同志，离开我们已经有十四年了。在这十多年中，中国的情况已起了极大的变化。当时他用音乐武器所战斗过的事业，现在已取得了基本的胜利。在今天来纪念他，我们感到有特殊的意义。
    十多年来的音乐运动给我们反复地证明了聂耳的道路是正确的。中国新音乐的旗帜只能是他而不能是别人。虽则在这个问题上曾经有过争论，有些人曾经从“纯技术”的观点来评价过聂耳，他们以聂耳没有受过所谓正规的音乐教育，不懂和声等幼稚可笑的论点来抹杀他对于中国人民的伟大贡献，也曾有人恶意地以他参加过明月歌舞团这一段历史而说他是靡靡之音派。但是，他们都没有理解到聂耳为什么会成为时代的先驱，他的音乐为什么会成为中华民族的呼声之所在。的确，我们如果从传统的旧的观点去评价他，那么一定不会得出正确的结论的。聂耳是一个普通的平凡的人物，他曾经当过小兵，做过商店的伙计，也做过明月歌舞团的提琴师，他没有一般人想象中的“音乐家”那种所谓“高贵的”或者传奇式的经历。但是，象这样一个平凡的人，他的事业却是中国音乐史上极不平凡一页的开端。
    聂耳所处的是一个低气压的年代。大革命由于大资产阶级的背叛而失败后，日本帝国主义乘机加紧其侵略活动，“九一八”“一二八”之后，民族危机日益紧迫，而国民党反动派却悍然不顾全中国人民的意愿，执行其所谓“睦邻外交”“安内攘外”的反动政策，对于全中国人民的抗日救亡运动施以高压。在音乐方面作为半封建半殖民地意识形态的靡靡之音正在大肆猖獗，间接地帮助了当时的反动派起了粉饰太平、麻醉人们意识的作用。一般音乐教育机关仍在按着欧美资产阶级国家的老样子转着翻版式的圈子；虽则也有一部分人由于民族危机的紧迫写作了一些抗日的歌曲，但也由于未与群众相结合，不久也消声匿迹了。广大的群众仍旧在旧的封建文艺的影响之下，只有在土地革命的苏维埃区域，产生了一些以民歌填词及外国介绍过来的革命歌曲；但是由于反动派的“军事围剿”以及苏区在全国所占的面积较小，这种歌曲与广大地区的群众是隔绝的。可以说，当时中国的音乐土地上是一片废墟、满目荒凉的景象。但是聂耳却以一个民族战士、阶级战士的姿态，如霹雳出现于满布乌云的天空一样出现在我们的面前。他创造了一种崭新的、光芒万丈的音乐，照耀了这个荒凉的废墟，使中国音乐的土地上开出花朵。
    聂耳是中国第一个现实主义的作曲家，他的作品给我们概括地描绘了他所处的时代的人民大众的典型情绪。多年以来，中国人民在帝国主义与封建主义两座大山的压制之下，曾进行了百折不挠的斗争。但是在聂耳以前还没有出现过一种真正代表人民大众的战斗的音乐。大革命时代所流行的“打倒列强，除军阀”的歌曲，虽则反映了当时的主要政治口号，但曲调却是从外国民歌借用的，还不能典型地刻画出当时的群众情绪。只有在以聂耳为代表的新音乐中我们才感到这种战斗的力量。假如说“马赛曲”最足以表现法国大革命时代的那种蓬勃的革命气概的话，那末“义勇军进行曲”（田汉词）正是抗日救亡运动中的进军号角。在他的音乐中才使我们真正听到了民族的声音，在这里已不是痛苦的呻吟，有的是愤怒的吼声，对于斗争前途的坚定的自信心。他和其他作家的歌曲在革命运动中所起的战斗作用，是谁也不能否认的。在当时，抗日救亡运动与反对国民党阻碍抗日的反动政策是分不开的，人民大众要求有抗日的自由，但是国民党却处处剥夺这种自由；抗日的言论受到限止，抗日的歌曲也在被禁止之列。因此演唱这种歌曲是带有双重的战斗意义的。试想想看：当群众的游行队伍高唱着救亡歌曲，手挽着手，冲破警察的水龙、木棍、机关枪而前进时，是有着何等伟大的气魄！当士兵唱着歌曲在战场冲锋前进时，是一幅何等雄伟的画面！以聂耳为代表的革命歌曲在团结、教育群众中所起的作用，岂为别种音乐所可比拟！
    聂耳所创造的音乐是为大众的音乐。他以他的实践来反对了“音乐是上界的言语”“音乐是为少数人的”这一切等等反人民的唯心的观点。虽则他在当时处在白色恐怖的地区，与土地革命的苏区隔绝，由于时代环境的限制不可能进一步深入群众，也不可能得到象毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上讲话这样明确的指示。但是由于他是一个共产党员，在党的教育之下，他的创作活动是向着为大众这个目标的。在他的歌曲中所出现的人物是广大的群众，其中主要的是劳动的工农，如：“开路先锋”（施谊词）“大路歌”（孙瑜词）“码头工人歌”（田汉词）等；也写了抗日的士兵，如“伤兵歌”（安娥词）“慰劳歌”（田汉词）等。他选择了在形式上群众所能接受的歌词，使用了与词结合得很好的音乐语言。在创作过程中他也善于去向群众学习，据说他在写“码头工人歌”时，就曾经跑到黄浦江边的码头上去听工人们的劳动呼声，写出后又三番四次跑去听后修改。因此他的作品能够被群众喜爱，并流传在群众中。他是把音乐从少数人手中夺取过来交到群众手中的一个伟大的大众歌手。
    聂耳在忠实于生活的基础上，又善于批判地吸取中外音乐遗产，来表现新的现实。此种创造性的工作，使得他的作品带有一种新鲜活泼的气派，为我们创造了一种新的民族形式。从西欧音乐介绍到中国来以后，中国音乐表现了一种半殖民地的形态，差不多成为外国的附庸，没有自己民族的特点。虽则也有人提倡过中国化，但是这种中国化是向封建贵族艺术吸取东西向着旧中国开倒车的；或者象当时的黎锦晖那样虽从民间吸取东西，但却适应着堕落的买办资产阶级及小市民趣味，并且深受着腐烂的资本主义的爵士音乐的影响。只有在聂耳的音乐中才真正清除了种种毒素。他的实践提供了我们如何批判地吸取遗产的先例。他吸取了民间音乐的语汇及与词结合的方法，但是却不同于旧的民歌，其中令人感到新的现实生活的气息。他也从外国形式吸取东西，但是总是使人感到民族的特点。他是一个不拘泥于成规的，富于创造性的作曲家。他的信条是忠实表现生活，为了这点可以打破一切的限制，同时也不忽略自己民族的传统。他所创造的是代表我们民族主体的人民大众的民族形式。
    聂耳留给我们的主要是三十多首群众歌曲。有人也许会觉得只有交响乐、歌剧、室内乐等才算是高级的艺术，群众歌曲是微不足道的。但是，作为一个阶级的先进战士的聂耳，他所着眼的是如何把音乐作为一种斗争的武器来服务于当时的政治任务；如何传达出群众的斗争情绪，它过来又鼓舞着群众去进行斗争。因此只要能服从于这样一个目的，不管任何形式都可采用的；而事实证明，群众歌曲是最好的一种武器，正如鲁迅在当时所采用的政治性的短论一样是一种有力的上首。因为群众歌曲是音乐与诗歌的综合艺术，它能把群众的情绪要求用音乐及语言集中地反映出来，二者的结合可以互相得到补足，发挥更大的效力。所谓艺术性的高低是由作品中所反映现实的深度及加工的程度而决定的。因此，徒有空洞形式的交响乐其艺术性不见得就高；一首饱满地反映了群众情绪的歌曲其艺术性就不见得低劣。事实上，要能写出一首好的群众歌曲并不是一般人想象的那么简单的事情。聂耳的歌曲是音乐与政治结合得最好的范例；是最能表现群众而又为群众所喜爱的。直到今天当人们提到他时，会说：“要是聂耳还在，他一定会为我们写更多好的歌曲”。虽则他的歌曲所表现的时代已经过去，它的战斗任务已经完成，但是对于我们仍旧有着极大的教育作用。在今后，群众的歌咏活动仍然是新音乐运动上主要的一方面。
    从聂耳以来，中国新的人民音乐运动已有十多年的历史。聂耳所开辟的道路，始终是我们前进的方向。在今天，这条道路是愈来愈宽广了。在打垮了国民党的反动统治后，中国即将展开一个广大的经济建设，文化建设的革命高潮。新音乐的前途是非常辉煌的。人民为我们创造了各种顺利条件，他们期待着我们创造出象毛主席所说的“历史上空前的人民大众当权的朝代”的音乐。我们的责任是重大的，工作是艰巨的。我们相信，只要我们善于向人民学习，向新鲜的事物学习，向我们所不熟悉的事情学习，我们是一定可以完成这个伟大的任务的。
    新音乐工作的同志们！团结起来！在聂耳所开辟的道路上继续前进！（附图片）
