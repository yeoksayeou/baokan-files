　　Ping City Mechanized Flour Milling Industry Trade Union Officially Established
　　[Report from this newspaper] The Ping City Mechanized Flour Milling Industry Trade Union held its members' representative assembly on the 26th at Zhuxin Elementary School. More than 30 representatives from various districts attended. The chairman first gave a report, pointing out that the purpose of the meeting was to quickly discuss, revise, and approve the trade union's constitution and the draft collective labor contract, and to elect trade union committee members to establish a formal trade union. This was to protect the legitimate interests of workers, improve their political, cultural, and technical levels, and unite all workers in Beiping to actively develop production. Subsequently, the trade union preparatory committee reported on the preparations. The assembly then engaged in a heated discussion of the draft trade union constitution, offering many valuable opinions on the chapters concerning general principles, membership, rights and obligations, organization, rewards and punishments, and membership dues. After the assembly passed the two drafts of the trade union constitution and the collective labor contract, it began the election. A total of eleven people, including Wang Zhiwan, were elected as executive committee members of the trade union. The establishment of the Mechanized Flour Milling Industry Trade Union is one of the earliest industrial trade unions to be established in the city. (Ming)
