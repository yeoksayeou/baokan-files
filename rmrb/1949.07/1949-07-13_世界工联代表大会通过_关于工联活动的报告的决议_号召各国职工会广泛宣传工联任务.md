Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th - TASS Milan Dispatch: The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) passed a resolution on the report on the activities of the WFTU on the 8th. The resolution is as follows:

(1) The Second Congress of the WFTU declares that this organization, in the forty-five months since its founding congress, has acted in complete accordance with the tasks and objectives proclaimed in its charter; its main task has been to implement the basic decisions passed at the London World Trade Union Conference, the Paris Congress, and the meetings of the Council and the Executive Committee. Throughout this period, the WFTU has dealt with various urgent issues of vital importance to the working people of all countries.

	The WFTU's Goal of United Struggle:
	1. To expose the reactionary conspiracy to persecute trade unions.
	2. To provide practical assistance to affiliated organizations.
	3. To establish international trade union central organizations.

(2) The Second Congress of the WFTU approves the policies and activities of the Executive Committee and the Executive Bureau since the establishment of the WFTU. The Congress notes the WFTU's efforts in the following areas: (a) strongly exposing the persecution suffered by trade unions and their leaders in capitalist, colonial, and semi-colonial countries; (b) providing practical assistance to the WFTU's affiliated organizations; (c) taking various measures to establish international trade union central organizations (trade union departments) based on occupational principles.

(3) The Second Congress approves the various actions taken by the WFTU to ensure representation in the United Nations organization. Despite the constant opposition of the governments of the United States, Britain, and other capitalist countries, the WFTU has obtained certain rights in the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) due to the WFTU's repeated insistence, and the WFTU has now obtained formal status as an international non-governmental organization in the Council. The WFTU has submitted the following issues of urgent importance to workers worldwide to the ECOSOC for consideration: (a) the issue of ensuring the realization and expansion of trade union rights and freedoms; (b) the issue of dealing with violations of trade union rights and freedoms; (c) the issue of implementing equal pay for equal work for men and women workers; (d) the issue of carrying out a practical struggle against inflation and maintaining the purchasing power of wages; (e) the issue of raising the living standards of working people in economically underdeveloped countries; (f) the issue of carrying out the struggle against unemployment and striving to achieve full employment policies. On all these issues, the Second Congress of the WFTU notes the WFTU's various efforts to win decisions satisfactory to all working people in the ECOSOC. The Congress believes that the WFTU must wage a struggle on each of these issues, regardless of the various difficulties that exist or may arise in the future, whether within the United Nations organization or in ad hoc bodies between governments with WFTU representatives participating. At the same time, the Congress expresses its resolute protest against the actions of certain governments within the United Nations that infringe upon the WFTU's legitimate rights and obstruct the consideration of issues of urgent importance to working people raised by the WFTU.

(4) The Second Congress of the WFTU notes that the WFTU has repeatedly issued strong protests against the fascist dictatorships in Spain and Greece, and against the colonial wars being waged in Indonesia and Vietnam. The WFTU advocates the swift eradication of German militarism, the eradication of Nazism and the democratization of Germany, the swift eradication of Japanese militarism and the democratization of Japan, and the widespread establishment of democratic trade unions in these countries, organized on the basis of complete trade union unity, representing the will of the working people. All these actions are a manifestation of the WFTU's struggle for world peace and democracy.

(5) The Second Congress of the WFTU approves the actions of the WFTU Executive Bureau, which warned workers worldwide about the aggressive aims of international reactionaries at the Washington Conference in September 1946. Less than a year after the end of World War II, international reactionaries have again embraced aggressive aims. The WFTU has repeatedly exposed the encroachments on the legitimate rights and living standards of working people by groups in the service of reactionary governments and by employers. The WFTU has constantly called on men and women workers to wage a tenacious struggle against all infringements on their rights and freedoms. In order to defend trade union rights and freedoms, in addition to activities in the United Nations organization, it is also necessary to directly influence public opinion and activities within the ranks of the working class. The Second Congress states that the offensive of reactionary imperialist forces continues to develop. Despite the resolute opposition of trade union organizations, in recent years, the purchasing power of the wages of the working class in capitalist, colonial, and semi-colonial countries has been greatly reduced, unemployment has increased, exploitation has intensified, and the living standards of working people have declined. The efforts of the working people and their trade unions to improve the position of the working class have been constantly opposed by the wealthy classes and governments representing the interests of capitalists. Despite the increasing repression, the strike movement continues to rise. In order to prohibit the spread of such large-scale social struggles, reactionary governments have promulgated anti-labor and anti-trade union laws. However, in all the countries around the world where social conflicts have occurred, the struggle continues, and trade unions, regardless of the political tendencies and religious beliefs of their members, are in fact inevitably waging a struggle to meet the demands of the working people on the program of economic and social demands outlined by the First Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

	Defend the Rights and Interests of the Working People:
	Defeat the Splitting Conspiracy of War Peddlers

(6) The Second Congress of the WFTU approves the statement of the WFTU Council in 1947, which stated: "The forces of monopoly capital everywhere want to undermine the unity of the working class, split and weaken the working class, and destroy its political power. If the forces of monopoly capital triumph, lasting peace, economic security, and better living conditions - all this will not be achieved, and the world will again embark on the tragic path that leads to economic decline, international conflict, and inevitably leads to new wars even more terrible than the last war." The most brazen policy of monopoly capitalists is manifested in the actions taken by US imperialism. The plan to strive for hegemony, the plan to strive for economic, financial, political, and military monopoly, that is, the Marshall Plan, is a manifestation of this brutal policy pursued by monopoly capitalists. This policy has been exposed by the WFTU Council at its Prague meeting in June 1947. The WFTU asserts that it is clear to all working people - trade union members worldwide: the implementation of the Marshall Plan has greatly increased the taxes and profits of capitalists in those Marshallized countries, restricted the free development of national industries, and has been followed by an increase in unemployment. This has further worsened the already deteriorated living conditions of the working class.

(7) The Second Congress points out that in order to achieve their hegemonic and reactionary goals, imperialist forces are carrying out large-scale propaganda to create an atmosphere conducive to launching a new world war. In order to achieve this goal, reactionary forces are striving to weaken the working class, split its ranks, in order to prevent the working class from organizing against their criminal anti-human plans.

(8) The World Federation of Trade Unions is one of the most serious obstacles in the path of imperialist forces to realize their criminal plans. Therefore, it is not surprising that these forces and their lackeys are fiercely attacking the WFTU, in order to undermine the WFTU's prestige and split the WFTU, and eliminate the WFTU.

(9) The Second Congress of the WFTU fully approves the position held by the majority faction of the Executive Bureau and the Executive Committee, who in January 1949 rejected the deceitful proposal of the British Trades Union Congress and the American Federation of Labor to suspend the activities of the WFTU, thereby destroying the WFTU organization. The WFTU Executive Bureau and the Executive Committee maintained the WFTU and continued to fulfill the decisions of the London World Trade Union Conference and the Paris Founding Congress, and defeated the reactionary forces and war peddlers. The latter, in fact, placed all their hopes on the attacks of the leaders of the American Federation of Labor and the Executive Committee of the British Trades Union Congress and some leaders of the American Congress of Industrial Organizations, which were launched to implement the policies of British and American imperialism in the ranks of the international trade union movement.

(10) The Congress condemns these leaders of the splitters, who are acting on the orders of the imperialist bloc to oppose the interests of the working people and oppose the working people's heroic defense of the WFTU's program and policies. The fact that those executive committee members elected by the First World Congress did not attend the Second Congress and report on the performance of their duties reveals their contempt for democracy and the obligations of unanimous agreement. The Second Congress of the WFTU has been fully informed of the attempts of the leaders of the British Trades Union Congress and the American Federation of Labor to obstruct the implementation of the most important decisions of the WFTU (these decisions include the establishment of trade union departments, the convening of the Asian Trade Union Representative Conference, the WFTU's policies in Germany and Japan, and the democratic unity of trade unions in these countries, etc.). The Congress believes that their withdrawal from the Executive Bureau meeting on June 19, 1949, is an acknowledgment that their policy aimed at paralyzing the WFTU has failed.

(11) The Congress states with satisfaction that the attempts of the leaders of the British Trades Union Congress and the American Federation of Labor to destroy the WFTU have been completely defeated. Despite the withdrawal of the British Trades Union Congress, the American Federation of Labor, and several other national central organizations from the WFTU, the WFTU remains a powerful, militant trade union organization that owns trade unions in the vast majority of countries in the world, regardless of race, nationality, religion, and political belief. The report of the Auditing and Credentials Committee has convincingly demonstrated the WFTU's sound financial condition and confirmed that the vast majority of organized workers worldwide still stand in the ranks of the WFTU.

The Second Congress of the WFTU, representing 71,786,515 members of the WFTU, approves the activities of its leading organs - the Executive Bureau, the Executive Committee, and the Council. The Congress reiterates that it is necessary to more resolutely pursue the WFTU's trade union policy, which must aim to maintain and strengthen the unity of the world trade union movement, and to achieve the broadest unity of working people - trade union members - without any discrimination in the ranks of the WFTU.

The Congress recommends that the WFTU leading organs, in all their future activities, pay special attention to mobilizing all working people, including members of trade unions that have withdrawn from the WFTU, to conduct a common struggle of the working class on the basis of the WFTU's economic and social program.

(12) The Second Congress approves the WFTU's activities in the United Nations organization and recommends that the Executive Bureau and the Executive Committee: (a) vigorously carry out work to ensure that the WFTU has full representation in the United Nations ECOSOC and specialized inter-governmental agencies; (b) resolutely and thoroughly defend the vital interests of working people in all international organizations, especially in the International Labor Office.

(13) The Second Congress instructs the Executive Bureau to expand the WFTU's actions in maintaining contact with all national trade union central organizations and all individual trade union organizations that support the WFTU. It calls on all these organizations to widely use propaganda (radio broadcasts, speeches, conferences, newspapers, magazines, pamphlets) to elucidate the role and activities of the WFTU on economic, social, and political issues of paramount importance to the world working class, and to carry out the WFTU's daily and regular activities in this way.

(14) The Second Congress firmly believes that the national trade union central organizations, the international trade union federations (trade union departments of the WFTU), and trade unions in every industry in all countries will, under the leadership of the WFTU, use all possible means to help establish regular and direct contacts among the hundreds of millions of working men and women worldwide.

The fulfillment of the decisions and resolutions of the Second Congress of the WFTU will be the most important task of the WFTU.

　　世界工联代表大会通过
  　关于工联活动的报告的决议
    号召各国职工会广泛宣传工联任务
    【新华社北平十二日电】塔斯社米兰讯：世界工联第二届代表大会八日通过关于世界工联活动的报告的决议。决议如下：
    （一）世界工联第二届代表大会声称：本组织自成立大会以来的四十五个月中，完全遵照会章所宣示的任务与目的而行动；其主要任务，在执行伦敦世界职工会大会、巴黎代表大会以及理事会和执委会会议上所通过的基本决定。在此全部期间，工联处理了对一切国家的劳动人民有迫切重要性的各种紧急问题。
　　工联团结斗争的目标
　　一揭露反动派迫害工会阴谋
　　二予所属各组织以实际援助
　　三成立国际职工会中央机构
    （二）世界工联第二届代表大会批准执委会与执行局自工联成立以来的政策及活动。代表大会注意到工联在如下各方面的努力：（甲）对资本主义、殖民地及半殖民地国家各职工会及其领袖之遭遇迫害，作强有力的揭露；（乙）予工联所属各组织以实际援助；（丙）采取种种措施，根据职业原则，建立国际职工会中央机构（各业职工部）。
    （三）二届代表大会批准工联为保证在联合国组织中的代表权而采取的种种行动。虽有美英及其他资本主义国家的政府经常的反对，但由于工联一再坚持而获得在联合国经济与社会理事会中某些权利，工联现已在该理事会中得到国际非政府组织的正式地位。工联曾提请联合国经社理事会审议以下对全世界工人有迫切重要性的问题：（甲）关于保证工会权利与自由之实现和扩大的问题；（乙）关于处理违反职工会之权利与自由的问题；（丙）关于实行男女工人同工同酬的问题；（丁）关于进行反对通货膨胀与保持工资购买力的实际斗争的问题；（戊）关于提高经济不发达的国家中劳动人民生活水准的问题；（己）关于进行反失业、争取实现充分就业政策的斗争问题。在所有这些问题上，工联第二届代表大会注意到工联在联合国经社理事会中赢得全劳动人民满意之决定的种种努力。代表大会认为工联必须在这些问题的每一项上进行斗争，不顾现存的或将来可能发生的种种困难。不论在联合国组织内，或在有工联代表参加的各国政府之间的特设机构内，都是一样。同时，代表大会对某些政府在联合国内侵犯工联的合法权利，并阻挠审议工联所提对劳动人民有迫切重要性的问题的种种行动，表示坚决的抗议。
    （四）工联第二届代表大会注意到工联已对西班牙和希腊的法西斯独裁，对在印尼与越南进行的殖民战争，一再发出强有力的抗议。世界工联主张尽速肃清德国军国主义、肃清纳粹并使德国民主化，尽速肃清日本的军国主义并使日本民主化，并且在这些国家里广泛建立代表劳动人民意志的、在职工会完全团结的基础上组织起来的民主职工会。所有这些行动，都是世界工联为全世界和平与民主而斗争的表现。
    （五）世界工联第二届代表大会批准工联执行局的行动，该执行局在一九四六年九月华盛顿会议上，曾警告全世界工人关于国际反动派的侵略目的。第二次世界大战结束后不到一年，国际反动派又抱起侵略的目的了。世界工联曾屡次揭露反动政府御用的集团以及雇主们对劳动人民合法权利和他们生活水平的侵犯。世界工联曾不断地号召男女工人们，为反对侵犯他们的一切权利与自由而进行顽强的斗争。为了保卫职工会的权利与自由，世界工联除了在联合国组织中活动外，直接影响整个舆论并在工人阶级队伍内的活动，也是必要的。二届代表大会称，反动的帝国主义力量的进攻仍继续在发展中。尽管有职工会组织的坚决反对，近几年来，在资本主义、殖民地与半殖民地国家里，工人阶级工资的购买力已大大地减低，失业增加了，剥削加剧了，劳动人民的生活标准下降了。劳动人民及其职工会极力要使工人阶级的地位得到改善，这种努力都遭到富有阶级与代表资本家利益的政府的不断反对。尽管镇压日益加剧，罢工运动却不断高涨。为了禁止这种大规模社会斗争的蔓延，反动政府便颁布了反劳工与反职工会法。但是，在全世界各个发生了社会冲突的国家中，斗争在继续着，各职工会不论其会员的政治倾向与宗教信仰如何，实际上都不可避免地要在世界职工会第一届代表大会所规划的经济与社会要求的纲领上，为满足劳动人民的要求而进行斗争。
　　保卫劳动人民权益
  　击败战贩分裂阴谋
    （六）世界工联第二届代表大会批准工联理事会一九四七年的声明，该声明称：“垄断资本力量到处都想破坏工人阶级的团结，分裂并削弱工人阶级，破坏其政治力量。如果垄断资本力量胜利，则持久和平、经济安全与较好的生活条件——这一切便会达不到，世界便又会走上悲剧的道路而招致经济下降，国际冲突，和不可避免地招致甚至比上次战争更加可怕的新战争。”最放肆的垄断资本家的政策，表现在美帝国主义所采取的行动上。争取称霸的计划，争取经济、财政、政治与军事独霸的计划，亦即马歇尔计划，是垄断资本家所奉行的这一残暴政策的一种表现。这种政策已为世界工联理事会在其一九四七年六月布拉格会议上揭露了。世界工联断言，这对于全体劳动人民——全世界的职工会会员来说，是十分明显：马歇尔计划的实施，使得那些马歇尔化的国家里的捐税与资本家的利润为之大增，民族工业的自由发展受到限制，并且接踵而来的是失业的增加。这使得工人阶级本来已恶化的生活条件更加恶化下去。
    （七）二届代表大会指出：帝国主义力量为了达到称霸和反动的目的，乃进行大规模的宣传，以制造出一种便于发动新世界战争的气氛。为了达到这个目的，反动力量便力求削弱工人阶级，分裂其队伍，以便阻止工人阶级有组织地反对他们罪恶的反人类的计划。
    （八）世界工联是帝国主义力量实现其罪恶计划道路上的最严重的障碍之一。所以，毫不奇怪，这些力量和他们的走狗便凶猛地攻击世界工联，为的是破坏工联威信和分裂工联，消灭工联。
    （九）世界工联第二届代表大会完全批准执行局与执委会多数派所持的立场，他们在一九四九年一月否决了英国职工大会与美国产联为了中止世界工联的活动，从而摧毁世界工联组织的诡诈的建议，世界工联执行局与执委会保持了世界工联并继续履行伦敦世界职工会会议与巴黎成立大会的决定，而打败了反动力量及战争贩子。后者，实际上把他们一切的希望都寄托在美国劳联领袖与英国职工大会执委会和美国产联某些领袖的进攻上，这些进攻是为了在国际职工运动行列中实行英美帝国主义政策而发动的。
    （十）代表大会谴责这些分裂分子首领，他们是奉帝国主义集团的命令来反对劳动人民利益、反对劳动人民英勇保卫世界工联纲领及政策的。那些经第一届世界代表大会选出的执委们，没有来参加第二届代表大会和报告其执行任务的情形，这显露了他们藐视民主及一致协议的义务。世界工联第二届代表大会已充分获悉英国职工大会与美国产联领袖阻碍履行世界工联最重要决定的企图（这些决定包括建立各业职工部、召集亚洲职工会代表会议、世界工联在德国和日本的政策与这些国家中职工会的民主团结等等）。代表大会认为他们在一九四九年六月十九日退出执行局会议，就是承认他们以瘫痪世界工联为目的的政策已遭失败。
    （十一）代表大会满意地声称：英国职工大会与美国产联领袖以摧毁世界工联为目的的企图遭到了完全的失败。尽管英国职工大会、美国产联与若干其他全国性中央机构脱离了世界工联，可是世界工联仍为不分种族、国籍、宗教与政治信仰、拥有世界绝大多数国家职工会的、强有力的战斗的职工会组织。审计与资格审查委员会的报告，已令人信服地证明工联财政的健全状况，并证实全世界绝大多数有组织的工人仍然站在世界工联的行列中。
    世界工联第二届代表大会代表世界工联七千一百七十八万六千五百一十五名会员，批准其领导机关——执行局、执委会与理事会——的活动。代表大会重申必须更加坚决地奉行世界工联的职工会政策，这政策的目的必须是保持和加强世界职工运动的团结，并在工联队伍中达成劳动人民——职工会会员毫无任何歧视的最广泛的团结。
    代表大会建议世界工联领导机关，在其未来全部的活动中，特别注意发动一切劳动人民，包括退出世界工联的各职工会的会员在内，在世界工联经济、社会纲领的基础上，进行工人阶级的共同斗争。
    （十二）二届代表大会批准世界工联在联合国组织中的活动，并建议执行局与执委会：（甲）大力进行工作，以便保证世界工联在联合国经社理事会及各国政府间专门机构中有充分的代表权；（乙）在一切国际机构，特别是在国际劳工局中，坚决和彻底保卫劳动人民的切身利益。
    （十三）二届代表大会训令执行局扩大世界工联在与一切全国性职工会中央机构及一切支持世界工联的个别职工会组织保持联系的行动。它号召所有这些组织广泛利用宣传（广播、讲演、会议、报纸、杂志、小册子）来阐明世界工联在对世界工人阶级有头等重要性的经济、社会、政治问题上的作用与活动，这样来进行世界工联的每日的、经常的活动。
    （十四）二届代表大会坚决相信：各全国性职工会中央机构、国际各业职工会联合会（世界工联的各业职工部）与所有国家每一行业的职工会，将在世界工联的领导下，用他们一切可能的方法，来帮助在全世界亿万劳动男女间建立经常与直接的联系。
    世界工联第二届代表大会的决定与决议的履行，将是世界工联最重要的任务。
