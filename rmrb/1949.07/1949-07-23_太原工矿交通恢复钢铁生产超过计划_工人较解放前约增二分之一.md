    Taiyuan's Mining, Industrial and Transportation Sectors Restore Steel Production, Exceeding Planned Targets; Workforce Increases by Approximately One-Half Compared to Before Liberation
    [Taiyuan Electric Dispatch] The industrial, mining, and transportation sectors of Taiyuan City, after being damaged by the Yan Xishan bandit gang, are currently in the process of resuming production. During the intense takeover work, workers first partially resumed work, while continuing to rush repairs, organize, and prepare for full resumption of work. At the same time, thanks to thorough preparation for the takeover work, with detailed investigations of the machinery, equipment, and production capacity of the units taken over, and advance purchases of large quantities of wood, cotton, grain, coke, ore, coal, etc., the factories were able to quickly obtain raw materials and begin production after a long period of encirclement and fierce fighting. By mid-May, 53 light and heavy industrial plants, including steel machinery, electricity, cement, mining, textile, printing, leather, matches, and cigarettes, had successively started operations. The number of workers increased from 14,700 (excluding staff) in April before liberation to more than 21,000. This is an increase of approximately one-half compared to before liberation. Through the efforts of all employees, the production plan for June was largely completed on schedule or exceeded. Lines have been fully repaired, and power generation has increased from 7,000 kilowatts to 13,000 kilowatts, resolving the power issue. The Northwest Steel Plant, ranking first in North China, produced 1,452 tons of steel ingots in June, exceeding the original planned output by 2.1%; and produced 1,696 tons of pig iron, exceeding the original planned output by 30%. In addition, the output of coke, calcium carbide, rails, etc., also exceeded the plan. Yucai Steel Machinery Plant, Northwest Kiln Plant, Leather Factory, Northwest Electrochemical Plant, Match Factory, Oxygen Plant, etc., also completed or exceeded their plans. Repair plants, manufacturing plants, Jinxing First Plant, Second Plant, Zhenxing Machinery, and Taiyuan Machinery Plant repaired a large number of weapons seized from the Yan Xishan puppet regime for the People's Liberation Army. In terms of artillery alone, 525 pieces had been repaired by June 10th.
    The Taiyuan workers are not only good at overcoming difficulties and actively completing production tasks, but also demonstrated a high degree of creativity: the steel plant had equipment as early as the period of Japanese and Yan Xishan bandit rule, but had never rolled steel rails. Less than a month after liberation, steel rails were successfully rolled thanks to the hard work of the employees. Ma Yiren of the Wool Weaving Factory transformed the carding machine, allowing more than 150,000 jin of waste wool left by the Japanese and Yan Xishan bandits to be woven into blankets.
    Although Taiyuan's industrial production has achieved these results, it is still far from the pre-war level, and there are still huge difficulties hindering the road to recovery: In order to persist in the anti-people civil war, the Yan Xishan bandit gang desperately expanded military production, and all equipment has been militarized. Turning to peaceful production is an extremely difficult and complicated task. The steel machinery industry has begun this transformation; the gray pig iron and open-hearth iron produced by the steel plant can be used for sand casting by both public and private factories, and great efforts are being made to roll rails and building materials. Yucai Factory has begun to manufacture Kakin mining machinery and produce three tons of tool steel per day. Zhenxing Machinery Plant and Taiyuan Machinery Plant, which used to specialize in repairing weapons, have been transformed to manufacture lathes and splints, screws, etc., for railways. However, there are still many difficulties in terms of workers, technology, and original machinery. Some factory leaders do not emphasize quality enough, such as the blankets produced by the Wool Weaving Factory being too sparse or having holes; the quality of the Jinding cloth produced by the Textile Factory has also declined compared to before, causing sales difficulties. A total of 2,500 tons of cement are in stock at the Cement Plant, but sales are very low, and the finished product storage tanks are full, forcing a temporary suspension of production. These difficulties and shortcomings are being gradually overcome.

    太原工矿交通恢复钢铁生产超过计划
    工人较解放前约增二分之一
    【太原电】经过阎匪破坏的太原市工矿交通事业，目前正在恢复生产中。在紧张的接管工作中，工人们一面先行部分复工，一面继续抢修、整理，筹备全部复工。同时，由于接管工作准备充分，事前对所接管单位的机器设备、生产能力都有详细调查，并预购了大批木料、棉花、粮食、焦炭、矿石、煤炭等，使各厂在长期围困与激烈战斗之后，能迅速得到原料，进行生产。至五月中旬，钢铁机器业、电业、洋灰业、矿业及纺织、印刷、皮革、火柴、卷烟等轻重工业共五十三厂，均陆续开动，工人由解放前四月份之一万四千七百人（不包括职员）增至二万一千余人。较解放前约增加二分之一。经过全体职工的奋斗，迄六月份的生产计划，已大部如期完成或超过。线路已全部修复，发电量由七千基罗瓦特增至一万三千基罗瓦特，动力问题已获解决。占华北第一位的西北炼钢厂，六月份产钢锭一千四百五十二吨，超出原定产量百分之二点一；产生铁一千六百九十六吨，超出原定产量百分之三十。此外，焦炭、电石、道轨等的产量，亦超过计划。育才炼钢机器厂、西北窑厂、皮革厂、西北电化厂、火柴厂、氧气厂等亦均完成或超过了计划。修造厂、制造厂、晋兴第一厂、第二厂、正兴机器、太原机器厂等则为解放军赶修了大批缴自阎伪手中的武器。仅炮一项，迄六月十日止，就修好了五百二十五门。
    太原职工不仅善于克服困难积极完成生产任务，而且发挥了高度的创造性：炼钢厂早在日寇与阎匪统治时期，就有设备，但未碾过钢轨，解放后不及一月，就在职工的辛勤努力下，试碾成功了。毛织厂工厂马依仁，改造了梳毛车，使日寇、阎匪遗留下来的十五万多斤废毛都能织成毛毯。
    太原工业生产虽有这些成绩，但离抗战前水平尚远，在恢复的道路上还横着巨大的困难：阎匪为了坚持反人民内战，曾拼命扩大军火生产，一切设备都已军工化，要转向和平生产，是个极其艰巨繁杂的任务。钢铁机器工业已开始此一转变；炼钢厂所产产之灰生铁与平炉铁，可为供应公私营各厂翻砂之用，并大力从事碾制道轨及建筑材料。育才厂开始制造卡金、采矿机器，并日产工具钢三吨。过去专门修理武器的正兴机器厂、太原机器厂，改为制造车床及供铁路用的夹板、螺丝等。但工人、技术及原有机械等方面困难尚多。有些厂领导上对质量强调不够，如毛织厂所出之毛毯太稀或有窟窿；纺织厂所出之晋鼎布质量亦较前降低，致使销售发生困难。洋灰厂共存二千五百吨，销售很少，堆满了成品贮存槽，以致不得不一度暂停生产。这些困难和缺点、正在逐步克服中。
