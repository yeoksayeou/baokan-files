　　Seventh Day of the Literary and Art Workers' Congress
　  Chen Boda Demands Increased Ideological Level
　  Emphasizes Studying Mao Zedong Thought and Style
　  Diligently and Repeatedly Studying Various Social Phenomena
    [Ping City News] The seventh day of the Literary and Art Workers' Congress was held yesterday (the 9th), chaired by Shakov. The agenda for the day was thematic speeches and an invitation to Chen Boda to speak. In addition to the thematic speeches being distributed in writing, Yang Hansheng supplemented his remarks on the progressive drama and film movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, which had been subjected to censorship, oppression, and restrictions by the Kuomintang reactionaries for the past three years. However, progressive drama workers persevered in their work under extremely difficult circumstances and won victories, while reactionary drama and film suffered a disastrous defeat. Ke Zhongping supplemented his remarks on the literary and art workers of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, who, during the invasion of the Hu Zongnan bandit army, cooperated with the army and the broad masses of the people in doing a great deal of propaganda and mobilization work. Ding Ling's supplementary speech, based on her own personal experience, vividly described the process of the integration of petty-bourgeois intellectuals with workers, peasants, and soldiers, pointing out that it requires long-term transformation and training. She also used her views on friends and beauty to explain the changes in her thoughts and feelings. She said that she now feels that true confidants are not built on taste and warmth, but are rooted in practical work and revolutionary struggle; and that the most beautiful thing is to work for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the ugliest thing is to work for personal, selfish things.
    Before Ding Ling's speech, Chen Boda arrived at the meeting to speak. Chen Boda first said that literary and art workers should be ideological people, and their works should be ideological works. However, such works have not been numerous since the May Fourth Movement, and have still not been too numerous in the liberated areas in recent years. Among the works he has read, Chen Boda said that "Li Youcai's Rhymes" is a relatively ideological work, because this book truly discovered problems and raised questions.
    The Popularization and Improvement of Literary and Artistic Work Cannot Be Separated from the Guidance of Thought
    Chen Boda continued, the popularization and improvement of literary and artistic work cannot be separated from the guidance of thought. Because popularization and improvement both involve concentrating the things of the masses. If the ideological content of a work is not high, it means that it has not been concentrated enough. There are still works that concentrate on partial things, but there are very few works that concentrate on more comprehensive things. In the past, our portrayal of the masses did not resemble the masses, and our portrayal of Communist Party members did not resemble Communist Party members. Now, our portrayal of the masses generally resembles them, and our portrayal of Communist Party members generally resembles them. This is a great progress. However, the portrayal of the leaders of Communist Party members is still not very similar, or rather, not many are similar. We should know that without leadership, there is no mass movement. If we only write about the masses and fail to write about the leading backbone and the leading role of Mao Zedong Thought, it will be difficult to write well about the mass movement. Therefore, if literary and art workers do not come into contact with leading cadres, it will be difficult for them to understand the leaders' intentions and it will be difficult for them to write comprehensively. Although the portrayal of the masses is generally similar, the characters within the masses are diverse, and we can only write about a few types. This requires further progress. Chairman Mao told us at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art that literary and art workers should study Marxism-Leninism and study society. By studying Marxism-Leninism, we will have a basic viewpoint and basic methods for viewing all things, and we can broaden our horizons. By studying society, we can describe all classes in society, including the ruling class.
    Chen Boda said that Mao Zedong Thought is the best combination of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, and literary and art workers must study Mao Zedong Thought. But studying Mao Zedong Thought is not to worship him as an idol, but to study his methods and style. Chairman Mao was not born with knowledge, but gained knowledge through hardship. Genius is just hard work. We must repeatedly study countless social phenomena in order to grasp the laws of motion. This kind of research is hard work. Literary and art workers must be able to discover problems and raise questions from reality, and this is not possible without repeated research.
    We Should Help All Aspects to Discover Problems and Raise Questions
    Chen Boda continued, after the national victory, the task of literary and art workers is even greater. Work in all aspects of the country requires the help of literary and art workers to help them discover problems and raise questions. We should sing the praises of the people and the proletariat, but singing praises is not flattery. At the same time, the people still have shortcomings, so in addition to singing praises, there should also be criticism and self-criticism.
    Finally, Chen Boda said that he deeply felt that the efforts of Chinese cultural workers were insufficient. This lack of effort does not mean that they subjectively do not want to work hard, but includes not being good at handling work and not being good at seizing time. The achievements of literary and art work still cannot meet the needs of the revolution. From the leadership's point of view, the help is not enough, and from the authors' point of view, the effort is not enough. He believes that in the future, under the leadership and care of Chairman Mao, coupled with their own efforts, literary and art workers across the country will surely achieve great victories. After Chen Boda's speech, Zhao Feng, the secretary of the congress, announced congratulatory telegrams from Soviet writers Fadeyev, Sholokhov, and Simonov, and a congratulatory telegram from the Soviet Union of Soviet Composers. After the announcement, the orchestra played the Soviet national anthem, and all the representatives stood up and applauded warmly.

　　文代大会第七日
  　陈伯达要求提高思想
　  强调学习毛泽东思想和作风
  　苦心反复研究社会各种现象
    【平市讯】第七日文代大会于昨日（九日）举行，沙可夫主席。是日日程为专题发言并邀请陈伯达讲话。专题发言除书面印发外，阳翰笙补充谈国统区进步的戏剧电影运动，三年来横遭国民党反动派检查、压迫、限制，但进步的戏剧工作者在极端困难的环境下坚持了工作，打了胜仗，而反动的戏剧电影则遭受了惨败。柯仲平补充谈陕甘宁文艺工作者在胡宗南匪军进攻的时候，配合军队及广大人民做了许多宣传动员工作。丁玲的补充发言则以自己切身的经验，生动地叙述了小资产阶级知识分子与工农兵结合的过程，指出那是需要经过长期改造和锻炼的。她并用对朋友和对美的看法说明她的思想感情的变化。她说她现在感到真正的知心朋友不是建筑在趣味和温情上面，而是扎根在现实工作与革命斗争中间；而最美的是为工农大众，最丑的是为个人、自私的东西。
    在丁玲发言之前，陈伯达莅临会场讲话。陈伯达首先说，文学艺术工作者应该是有思想的人，他们的作品应该是有思想的作品。但这样的作品，从五四运动以来并不多，解放区这几年来也还是不太多。在他所读到的作品中，陈伯达说，“李有才板话”是比较有思想的作品，因为这本书里面的确发现了问题，提出了问题。
    文艺工作的普及和提高都离不开思想的指导
    陈伯达继续说，文艺工作的普及和提高都离不开思想的指导。因为普及和提高，都是要把群众的东西集中起来。作品的思想性不高，就是集中得不够。把部分的东西集中起来的作品还有，把比较全面的东西集中起来的作品就很少了。过去我们表现群众不象群众，表现共产党员不象共产党员，现在我们表现群众一般的都象了，表现共产党员也一般的都象了，这是一个很大的进步。但是，表现共产党员的领导者还是不大象，或者说象的不多。我们应该知道，没有领导就没有群众运动。假若只写群众，写不出领导骨干，写不出毛主席思想的领导作用，就很难把群众运动写得好。因此，文艺工作者不接触领导干部，就很难了解领导的企图，就很难写得全面。写群众虽然一般的都象了，但群众里面的人物是各种各样的，我们现在还只能写出很少几样，这也还要再进一步。毛主席在延安文艺界座谈会上告诉我们，文艺工作者要学习马列主义，要学习社会。学习了马列主义，我们就有了看一切事物的基本观点，基本方法，就可以扩大我们的眼界。学习社会，我们才能描写社会上的各个阶级，包括统治阶级在内的各个阶级。
    陈伯达说毛泽东思想就是马列主义和中国革命实践的最好的结合，文艺工作者必须学习毛泽东思想。但学习毛泽东思想并不是把他当偶像来崇拜，而是学习他的方法、作风，毛主席并不是生而知之，而是困而知之。天才就是苦工夫。必须把无数社会现象反复研究，才能抓住运动的规律。这种研究就是苦工夫。文艺工作者要能从现实中发现问题，提出问题，没有这种反复研究是不行的。
    应帮助各方面发现问题提出问题
    陈伯达继续说，在全国胜利以后，文艺工作者的任务更大了，全国各方面的工作都要求文艺工作者的帮助，帮助他们发现问题，提出问题。我们应该歌颂人民，歌颂无产阶级，但歌颂并不是谄媚。同时，人民还是有缺点的，因此歌颂之外，还应有批评和自我批评。
    最后，陈伯达说，他深感中国文化工作者的努力不够。这种努力不够，并不是说主观上不想努力，而是包括不善于处理工作，不善于抓紧时间在内。文艺工作的成绩还不能满足革命的需要，从领导上说是帮助不够，从作者本身说则是努力不够。他相信今后全国文艺工作者在毛主席的领导和关心之下，加上自己的努力，一定可以获得很大的胜利。陈伯达讲话后，大会秘书赵沨宣读苏联作家法捷耶夫、萧洛霍夫、西蒙诺夫等贺电和苏联苏维埃作曲家协会贺电。宣读毕乐队奏苏联国歌，全体代表起立，热烈鼓掌。
