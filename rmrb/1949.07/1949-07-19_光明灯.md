Beacon Light
Bai Sulin

During the Huaihai Campaign, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Qiu-Li army corps was surrounded by our forces in a corner. At that time, the enemy and our positions were very close. The enemy lacked food and clothing, and was in great disarray. Our army immediately launched a frontline offensive, achieving good results. As a result, they were completely annihilated. "Beacon Light" was one of the frontline offensive methods used at that time.

Dark clouds cover the pitch-black sky,
The sound of people is still, the horses silent;
The encirclement becomes smaller and smaller,
The fate of the Chiang bandits is nearing its end.
Donkey-hide wheat seedlings were eaten clean,
Coffins were searched for firewood to burn.
The aroma of rice wafts from the People's Liberation Army positions,
Causing the Chiang bandit soldiers to salivate.
Every night, calls resound everywhere,
"Comrade, Comrade" is called sweetly:
"Who are you fighting for, who are you busy for?
Don't sacrifice your life for Chiang Kai-shek;
The People's Liberation Army has always been lenient,
Turning back is the shore."
One Chiang soldier was moved,
He decisively turned his gun around;
But because it was dark and blurry everywhere,
He didn't know where to go.
Bumping east and touching west, he went the wrong way,
A bullet flew and hit his shoulder.
Luckily, the young man was quick-witted,
And finally reached the People's Liberation Army position:
"You need to hang up a light,
A large group of insurgents are behind me."
Beacon light, bright and shining.

Hanging on a big tree at the People's Liberation Army position;
Everywhere is dark and cavernous,
But here the light shines brightly.
Chiang bandit soldiers see it and are very happy,
They hold their breath and start to calculate;
"This light is our life-saving light,
Following it, there is hope."
Again, dark clouds cover the pitch-black sky,
The sound of people is still, the horses silent.
The Chiang bandit sentry sees the beacon light,
A smile spreads across his face with joy:
"Heading towards the light, there is hope,
Staying in hell is death;
I only have one life,
I'll risk it and give it a try."
Slowly crawling to the light,
Opening his mouth, he shouts loudly:
"People's Liberation Army comrades, listen carefully,
Why do I see the light but not the people?"
"Crawl forward slowly,
Just one more yard and you're there!"
Three or five, a group,
Forming groups, ah,
Rushing towards the beacon light…

    光明灯
    白苏林
    淮海战役，蒋匪邱李兵团被我包围于一隅。当时敌我阵地相隔很近。敌人无吃少穿，甚形混乱。我军即时发动了火线攻势，收得良好效果。结果将其聚歼之。“光明灯”就是当时火线攻势方式之一。
    一
    阴云密布漆黑天，
    人声静来马不喧；
    包围圈越来也越小，
    蒋匪的命运快玩完。
    驴皮麦苗吃了个光，
    棺材当柴也找遍。
    解放军阵地飘来米饭香，
    蒋匪军闻到滴唾涎。
    一入夜晚遍地喊，
    口口同志叫的甜：
    “为谁打仗为谁忙？
    不要为蒋介石把命丧；
    解放军从来讲宽大，
    回过头来就是岸。”
    一个蒋军动了心，
    调转枪口当机断；
    只因黑糊糊地一大片，
    不知哪里是去向。
    东撞西摸走错了路，
    飞来一颗枪子打中了肩。
    总算小伙子心眼灵，
    最后才到解放军阵地边：
    “你们要挂灯一盏，
    大批起义的在后边”。
    光明灯，亮又亮。
    二
    悬在解放军阵地的大树上；
    四方都是黑古洞洞，
    这里的灯光闪闪亮。
    蒋匪士兵看见好喜欢，
    蹩住心眼打算盘；
    “这灯是咱的救命灯，
    跟着她走有希望”。
    又是阴云密布漆黑天，
    人声静来马不喧。
    蒋匪哨兵看见光明灯，
    喜在心中笑开了脸：
    “投奔灯光有希望，
    呆在地狱里就死亡；
    老子性命只一条，
    豁出它来干上一干。”
    慢慢爬到灯光下，
    张开嘴巴就大喊：
    “解放军同志你听清，
    为何见灯不见人？”
    “你再慢慢往前爬，
    不过一码就到啦！”
    三五个，一群群，
    成群结队的呀，
    投奔着光明灯……。
