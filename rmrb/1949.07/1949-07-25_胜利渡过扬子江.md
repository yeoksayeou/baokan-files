　　Victorious Crossing of the Yangtze River
　　(Collective Creation of the Second Field Army Representatives to the Literary Congress, Written by Zeng Ke and Hu Qi)

　　Scene Three

　　Ten days after the second scene, the sky is gloomy, as if it is about to rain. Wang Zhiwu is in the thatched shed checking the life preservers. Soon, Cheng Baihe walks down from the wooden boat by the shallow water, carrying an axe.

　　Cheng (looking at the sky): It's the plum rain season. It's been ten full days since I signed up to be a sailor, and I haven't seen a single sunny day! (Turning to Wang) Deputy Squad Leader Wang, you should take a break too. You haven't slept for several nights. Let them count the life preservers.

　　Wang (yawning deeply): These days have been really something, even more lively than the New Year! You, old man, have a tough body. You've been working with us day and night, with the same spirit as the young people.

　　Cheng (satisfied): Ha, ha, I was born with a restless spirit. Seeing the comrades working there, each one doing the work of ten, I can't help but lend a hand. It's great to see you all salvage boats from the water and repair them one by one. Since last year, it's been hard to even see a fishing boat on Stone Pond Lake. Look, it's bustling again.

　　Wang: Grandpa Cheng, please sit down. Have a smoke!

　　Cheng: No, I have my own. Deputy Squad Leader, I've already repaired Old Granny Gu's boat. That old woman is such a nag. She's brought over her broken belongings from the boat countless times. Otherwise, it would have been repaired long ago.

　　Wang: She relies on the boat to live, so the boat is her life. This time repairing the boats is all thanks to your expertise. We young people don't understand the rules of the boatmen. Last time we took down Xu Lao Si's sail, it caused such a mess. If you hadn't followed the old methods and personally instructed us, Xu Lao Si's wife would have definitely made a scene!

　　Cheng: Deputy Squad Leader, haven't you been arranging to install a native-made machine on the wooden boat these days? Comrade, I must advise you against it. I'm afraid it will be a thankless task. I think it's better to learn the skills I taught you. I've been steering boats my whole life, with forty or fifty years of experience. The ancients said, "A thousand-dan boat relies entirely on one rudder." As long as the rudder is steered well and the sail is set right, you can cross the Yangtze smoothly. Why bother with all that?

　　Wang: Grandpa Cheng, didn't you say that sailing depends on catching a favorable wind? If there isn't a northeast wind on the day we cross the river, it will be difficult to manage.

　　Cheng: You are doing things for the people. When the time comes, the heavens will surely bless you and send a favorable wind.

　　Wang: Grandpa Cheng, we can't rely on the heavens. I think it's better to experiment with that native-made machine. We need to be prepared for everything.

　　Cheng (shaking his head): Alas, it's difficult. No one has ever done it like this for many years.

　　Wang: Old man, as long as you put in the effort, an iron rod can be ground into a needle. Nothing is too difficult for the People's Liberation Army.

　　Cheng: That's right, then give it a try.

　　Wang: Okay, Grandpa Cheng, if this native-made machine is successfully tested, our squad is sure to be on the assault team. When the time comes, you will cross with us first!

　　Cheng: That wouldn't be right!

　　(Squad Leader Shi Quanyi, Li Fugui, Yang Hu, Zhang Shuanglin, and Xiao Lin enter.)

　　Yang: Squad Leader, our squad is late again today. Before I finished my meal, I heard the whole mountain and lake buzzing.

　　Li: That landlubber insists on smoking two pipes of tobacco!

　　Zhang: Bullshit, blames his poor skills on his sleeves, and his long sleeves on his mother. Today is the Deputy Squad Leader's duty, and he didn't come to the assembly, so why blame me!

　　Shi: Yang Hu, you have a firecracker temper, always exploding at the slightest spark. What are you in such a hurry for? There's still some time before the official exercise.

　　Lin: (Speaking in quick rhythm) That's right, that's right, really right, the practice time isn't over yet, don't complain about the Deputy Squad Leader, he's researching a new creation, the duty assignment was given to me long ago, why bother you to nag, nag, nag, nag, nag.

　　Crowd (clapping): Wonderful, wonderful.

　　Wang: You're all here?

　　Shi: Deputy Squad Leader, today we have a big exercise. Everyone wants to see your native-made steamer. Can you bring it out? The regiment called and said the regiment commander wants to see it in person.

　　Wang: Just waiting for Zhang the carpenter to finish the wooden wheel and install it on the boat.

　　Li: Deputy Squad Leader, I see you haven't been thinking about tea, haven't been thinking about food, and can't even sleep these days. You're completely obsessed. If it's successful, our squad leader will definitely get the first merit.

　　Zhang (grabbing a life preserver and putting it on): Wonderful. Ever since someone invented this life preserver, you won't sink in the water if you wear it. The first time I went into the water, I didn't believe it. I stood by the water's edge for a long time and didn't dare to move.

　　Li: Hmph, that time if I hadn't suddenly pulled you into the lake and run away, your feet would have left the ground and floated. Otherwise, you would have stood by the water's edge and watched forever!

　　Lin: Look at this, it's even more elaborate. There are foot rests and seats. It's really thoughtful.

　　Shi: As long as everyone uses their brains, anything can be created!

　　Yang: Squad Leader, let's start practicing. The weather is bad and it could rain at any time. Let's practice as much as we can.

　　Wang: The company just sent over a jar of wine. Comrades, have a drink first to warm your bellies!

　　Cheng: That's right, this year is unusually cold. It's been a long time since spring, but it's still like winter. Wearing a cotton-padded jacket and standing by the lake, the wind is still whistling!

　　Mao (enters): Deputy Squad Leader, Zhang the carpenter is looking for you. He said the native-made machine you invented is finished.

　　Wang: Good, I'll go take a look! (Mao follows him down)

　　(Everyone drinks wine and discusses.)

　　Shi: Grandpa Cheng, have the cotton and lime on our boat been prepared? We need to practice today too and see if it works.

　　Cheng: Squad Leader, don't worry. This is our ancestral experience. If the wooden boat gets two or three holes, it can be patched up immediately.

　　Li: Don't worry, even if something goes wrong and the boat breaks apart, I can grab a piece of wood, set up a machine gun, and lead our whole squad across.

　　Yang: Blowing it again, blowing it again.

　　Li: Only talking and not practicing is just bragging. Watch me today. (Takes off his clothes).

　　Li: Landlubber, are you coming down?

　　Zhang: Down!

　　(Li, Yang, and Zhang jump down one after another!)

　　(Squad Leader Shi is about to take off his clothes when Lao Wu runs up with a letter.)

　　Wu: Squad Leader, Squad Leader, slow down, slow down!

　　Shi: What is it?

　　Wu: I said to do it sooner, do it sooner, but you didn't listen. Now, well, they've come.

　　Shi: Who's come!

　　Wu: They've come here.

　　Shi: Whose family letter?

　　Wu: Not a family letter, it's the challenge letter from the Eighth Squad!

　　Lin (snatching the letter): I'll read it, I'll read it!

　　Shi: Slower, slower, call them up. Comrades, the Eighth Squad has sent a challenge letter. Come up quickly!

　　(Li, Yang, and Zhang come up one after another, shivering.)

　　Li: Squad Leader, what is it?

　　Yang Zhang (together): What happened?

　　Shi: The Eighth Squad has sent a challenge letter.

　　Yang: Damn it, they got ahead of us again!

　　Zhang: What's the hurry, let's see what conditions they've proposed?

　　Shi: Slowly, put on your clothes before reading.

　　Yang: Not cold, not cold, read it quickly, we still have to go back into the water after listening?

　　Cheng: Alas, young people… (Saying this, he picks up clothes and puts them on them one by one.)

　　Lin (reading the letter): Comrades of the Sixth Squad, pay attention, we are challenging you. This river crossing mission is big, and liberating the whole country depends on us. Let's have a competition between our two squads and ask our company commander to judge. We've written down our conditions below, no more, no less, just three points: First, no retreat, only forward, Communist Party members should set an example. Second, unite and help each other well, and don't be afraid of difficulties in completing the task. Third, charge bravely to the shore and strive to be the first boat to land.

　　Yang: Do it, no problem, I'll crawl ashore even if I have to crawl. Xiao Lin, reply, reply!

　　Lin: Reply, reply with what?

　　Yang: You idiot, they sent a challenge letter, aren't you going to reply?

　　Lin: How to reply!

　　Yang: Accept the challenge! Accept the challenge!

　　Zhang: Accept the challenge, accepting the challenge also has conditions!

　　Li: What conditions should we propose?

　　Shi: Not only must we be brave, but we must also have a plan, so let's propose this!

　　(Everyone falls silent.)

　　Zhang: Look, look, isn't this a plan, isn't this a plan coming?

　　Shi: What plan?

　　Zhang: Look, look!

　　(At this moment, Wang Zhiwu and Zhang the carpenter lift a wooden sliding machine up, followed by Sister-in-law Shen, Mao, and Granny Gu.)

　　Wang (to Zhang): Zhang the carpenter, put it here.

　　Carpenter: It's made according to your design, but I don't know if it's right.

　　Wang: It's about right, let's try installing it!

　　Crowd: The native-made machine, is it done? (Swarming forward.)

　　Wang: Don't mess around, don't mess around!

　　Yang: Install it quickly and try it out!

　　Crowd: Right, install it and try it out, I'll lift it, I'll lift it!

　　Yang: Need so many hands, I can carry it myself!

　　Zhang: It's safer to lift it, don't break it.

　　Shi: Okay, stop the fuss, stop the fuss, Deputy Squad Leader, which boat should we install it on?

　　Yang: None of the others are the same, it's this one, Grandpa Cheng repaired it perfectly!

　　Wang: We still have to saw a notch in the boat. Zhang the carpenter, where's the saw!

　　Zhang: I didn't bring it!

　　Lin: Okay, I'll go get a saw!

　　Gu (squeezing out from the crowd): My God, what are you all messing with, it's come to my head again.

　　Wang: Granny Gu, listen to me, it won't break anything.

　　Gu: It won't break anything, it won't break anything? You sawed a notch in the boat, and it won't break anything?

　　Yang: Granny, this boat will be very fast when it's equipped with the native-made machine!

　　Gu: Forget it, I don't want fast, I don't want fast, slow is more stable. If you install this monster, you won't be able to uninstall it later.

　　Wang: Granny, it can be removed.

　　Gu: Whether it can be removed or not, I don't want this strange thing on my boat.

　　Shen: Deputy Squad Leader Wang, how about doing this, if Granny Gu doesn't want it, just install it on my boat.

　　Soldiers: Okay! That's Sister-in-law Shen! Let's go!

　　(The soldiers laughingly carry the pulley down.)

　　(Cheng Baihe and Granny Gu are left on stage.)

　　Cheng: Ah, these young people have great enthusiasm.

　　Gu: Old Cheng, do you really think they can make something out of this? If we're going to cross the river, just let everyone cross with their boats, why do we need a native-made machine?

　　(Distant voices of soldiers: "Saw it deeper, saw it deeper!")

　　Gu (heart aching): Tsk, tsk, Old Cheng, listen, Sister-in-law Shen's boat is finished.

　　Cheng: According to the Deputy Squad Leader's plan, if it's successful, it will be easier to row later.

　　(Soldiers' voices: "Okay, okay, just right, just right," "I'll row, I'll row," "Landlubber, let me do it, let me do it.")

　　Gu: Is it successful? Old Cheng, my eyes are failing, go down and take a look. (Cheng exits.)

　　Gu (to herself): Ah, if this is successful, it won't cost a penny or any labor. Just install a native-made machine on our own boat. Sister-in-law Shen has struck gold.

　　(The Deputy Squad Leader and soldiers enter.)

　　Soldiers: Deputy Squad Leader, stand on the slope to see, it's higher and you can see further.

　　Yang: Guys, look, it's so fast!

　　Li: It works, with the native-made steamer, it's twice as fast as paddling!

　　Lin: It's great, even landlubbers can row!

　　Soldiers (applauding): Rows well, rows wonderfully, landlubber, want to row faster or not?

　　(Offstage: "We want to!" Laughter, applause.)

　　Gu: Comrades, give me a hand, let me see it too.

　　(Cheng Baihe and Sister-in-law Shen enter.)

　　Cheng: Deputy Squad Leader, you've done a great thing. You're great, you're great. From ancient times to the present, no one has ever thought of putting a native-made machine on a boat. The People's Liberation Army is brave and resourceful, and nothing can stop you. This time crossing the Yangtze River will definitely be a success, a success.

　　Gu: Old Cheng, is it really fast?

　　Cheng: Fast!

　　Gu: Is it good?

　　Cheng: Good!

　　Gu (turning to pull Shen): Sister-in-law Shen, you've struck gold. (Turning to pull Wang again) Deputy Squad Leader, Deputy Squad Leader, put a native-made machine on my boat too!

　　(Offstage singing)

　　胜利渡过扬子江
    （文代会二野代表集体创作曾克、胡奇执笔）
    第三场
    距离第二场十天以后，天阴沉沉的，象要下雨，王治五在茅棚里检查着救生架，一会程百合拿着斧子从弯在浅水边的木船上走下来。
    程（看看天色）：正赶上黄梅天，打那天我来报名当水手起，整整十天了，就没见过一天晴天！（返身对王）王副班长，你也该歇歇了，好几夜都没睡过，这救生架呀，叫他们去清点吧。
    王（深深打了个呵欠）：这几天真够劲啊，比过年过节还热闹呢，你老人家身体算个硬梆，白天黑夜跟着我们一块干，精神同年青人一样足呢。
    程（满意地）：哈，哈，我生来就是个闲不住的命。看着同志们一个顶十个的在那里干，我不插把手，心上可说不过去，真好啊，眼看着你们把一只只船从水里捞起来，又一只只修补好，自旧年起，这石塘湖连只渔船影子也不易见，看，又活动起来了。
    王：程大爷，你老人家坐下来吧。抽烟！
    程：不，我自己有，副班长，古老奶奶家这只船我已经修补好了，这个老太婆真罗嗦，光她船上的点烂家当，不知道拿了多少次，要不早就修好了。
    王：靠着船过日子的，船就是他的命，这一阵修补船，全亏了你这老在行，我们这伙年青人又不懂船家规矩，上次下徐老四家风篷，闹了多大乱子，要不是你老人家按着老办法，亲自去指点，徐老四老婆一定吵翻了天！
    程：副班长，你这几天不是安排着在木船上装一付土机器么？同志，这我可得劝劝你，怕要出力不落好，我看还是把我教你的那一套本领学好。我掌舵掌了一辈子，四五十年的老经验啦，古人说：“千担之舟，全仗一舵。”只要舵掌好，篷扯对，就一帆风顺过长江。你费这个事干什么？
    王：程大爷，你不是说乘风篷要碰着刮顺风吆，要是过江那天不起东北风，临时就不好办了。
    程：你们是为老百姓办事的，到时候老天爷一定会保佑你们，给刮一场顺风。
    王：程大爷，那能靠天吃饭哟，我看还是把那土机器实验出来好，什么事都要有个防备才好。
    程（摇头）：唉，难，多少年来也没人这样做过。
    王：老人家，只要功夫深，铁杵也能磨成绣花针，什么也难不倒解放军。
    程：对，那你试着来吧。
    王：好，程大爷，要是这回土机器实验成功，突击队保险落在我们班上了。到时候你也同我们先过！
    程：那该不好哩！
    （班长史全义与李富贵、杨虎、张双林，小林上。）
    杨：班长，今天咱们班又出动晚了，一顿饭时以前，我就听见满山满湖的闹起来了。
    李：就那旱鸭子还非要抽两袋烟不行！
    张：球，手不溜怨袄袖，袄子长怨他娘，今天该副班长值日，他不来集合，怎么怨到我头上来啦！
    史：杨虎，你这个麦秸火皮气，总是一点就着，你急个啥哟，离正式演习时间还有一会呢。
    林：（说快板）不错，不错，真不错，练习时间并没过，不要埋怨副班长，他正研究新创作，值日任务早就交给我，何必用你多罗嗦，多罗嗦，多罗嗦，多，罗嗦。
    众（拍手）：妙，妙。
    王：你们都来了？
    史：副班长，今天我们大演习，大家都要看你那个土轮船，能拿出来吧？团里打电话来，说团长还要亲自来看呢。
    王：就等着张木匠把木轮做好，往船上装了。
    李：副班长，我看你这几天茶不思，饭不想，连觉也睡不着，简直入了迷，要是成了功，我们班长头一功是立定了。
    张（抓起一个救生架，往身上一套。）真好，自从谁发明了这救生架，套了他在水里就是不沉，头一回下水，我还不信呢，站在水边半天不敢动。
    李：哼，那一回要不是我猛不防把你往湖里一拉，我撒手一跑，你双脚才离了地飘起来，要不你要站在水边看一辈子呢！
    林：嗬，瞧这个更讲究了，还有蹬脚的，坐的，想的真周到。
    史：只要大家用脑筋。什么也能创造！
    杨：班长，咱们说练就练吧，天不好，说下就下，能练一点就一点。
    王：刚刚连上送来一罐酒，同志们先喝一杯，暖暖肚子！
    程：可不，今年是倒春寒，打春好久了，还象冬天一样，穿着棉袄，站在湖边上，风吹的还飕飕的！
    毛（上）：副班长，张木匠找你呢，说你发明的那个土机器做好了。
    王：好，我去看看！（毛ěｒ＠①随下）
    （大家一面喝酒，一面议论。）
    史：程大爷，咱们那只船上的棉花石灰都准备好了没有，今天也得演习演习，看看顶不顶事。
    程：班长，放心吧，这是我们祖传的老经验了，木船万一打上两三个洞，一补就补住了。
    李：不怕，就是出个一差二错，船打散了，我抓上块木板，也能架上挺机枪，带着我们全班人打过去。
    杨：又吹了，又吹了。
    李：光说不练嘴把戏，今天看我的。（脱衣服）。
    李：旱鸭子，下不下？
    张：下！
    （李、杨、张三个人一个接一个跳了下去！）
    （史班长正要脱衣服，老吴看一封信跑上。）
    吴：班长，班长，慢下，慢下！
    史：什么事。
    吴：我说要早一些办，早一些办，你们不听，现在好，人家可来了。
    史：谁来了！
    吴：这儿来了。
    史：谁的家信？
    吴：还家信呢，八班来的挑战书，
    林（抢过信）：我念，我念！
    史：慢一些，慢一些，把他们叫上来。同志们，八班来了挑战书了，快上来呀！
    （李、杨、张陆续上，身上打着抖。）
    李：班长，什么事。
    杨张（同说）：怎样啦？
    史：八班来了挑战书了。
    杨：真操蛋，又叫人家占了先！
    张：急什么，看他提的什么条件？
    史：慢一点，穿上衣服再念吧。
    杨：不冷，不冷，快念吧，听完还得下水呢？
    程：唉，年青人啦………（说着，有衣服拾起来一个一个给他们披在身上。）
    林（念信）：六班同志仔细看，咱们同你来挑战，这次渡江任务大，解放全国全靠咱，咱们两班竞个赛，请咱连长来评判，我们条件写下边，不多不少整三点：第一点，不准后退只向前，共产党员作模范。第二点，团结互助做的好，完成任务不怕难。第三点，勇猛直前冲上岸，争取登陆第一船。
    杨：干，不成问题，老子爬也得爬上岸去，小林，回，回回！
    林：回，回什么？
    杨：你这笨蛋，人家来挑战书，你还不回？
    林：怎么回呀！
    杨：应战么！应战么！
    张：应战，应战也得有个条件呀！
    李：提个什么条件呢？
    史：不光要勇敢，还要有办法，就按这个提！
    （大家沉默下来。）
    张：你们看，你们看，这不是办法，这不是办法来了？
    史：什么办法？
    张：看，看！
    （正在这时王治五同张木匠抬着一个木制滑动机上，沈大嫂，毛＠，古老奶奶随上。）
    王（对张）：张木匠，放到这里吧。
    木：按你的图样做的，可不知对不对？
    王：差不多了，装上试试看！
    众：土机器，成了？（拥上去。）
    王：不要乱通，不要乱通！
    杨：快装起来试一试！
    众：对，装起来试试，我来抬，我来抬！
    杨：还要你们这多手，我一个人就扛起来了！
    张：还是抬住保险，别蹩坏了。
    史：算了，别乱哄，别乱哄，副班长，往那一个船上装？
    杨：那一只不一样，就是这一只吧，程大爷早修理得停停当当了！
    王：还得在船上锯一个缺口呢，张木匠，锯子呢！
    张：我没带！
    林：好，我去找锯！
    古（从人群里钻出来）：我的老天爷呀，你们想么样倒腾啦，又弄到我头上来了。
    王：古老奶奶，你听我说，装不坏。
    古：装不坏，装不坏，船上锯了个缺口，还装不坏呢。
    杨：老奶奶，这船装上了土机器，开起来可快着呢！
    古：算了吧，我不要快，我不要快，慢着点还稳当，装上这怪物，以后卸都卸不掉。
    王：老奶奶，去的掉。
    古：不管去掉去不掉，我这船不要这怪东西。
    沈：王副班长，这样办好不好，古老奶奶不愿意，就装到我船上吧。
    战士们：行！还是人家沈大嫂！走！
    （战士们七手八脚哄笑着把滑轮机抬了下去。）
    （场上留下程百合与古老奶奶。）
    程：啊呀，这伙年青人干劲真大。
    古：程老头，他们当真能闹出个么事来哟，要过江了，有人有船尽过就是了，还要什么土机器。
    （远处战士们声音：“锯深一些，锯深一些！”）
    古（心疼的）：啧，啧，程老头，你听听，沈大嫂家的船可完了。
    程：照着副班长那个办法，要成了功，以后划起来就更顺手。
    （战士们的声音：“行了，行了，刚合式，刚合式”，“我来划，我来划”，“旱鸭子，让我来，让我来”。）
    古：成了功了？程老头子，我眼睛花了，你快下去看看吧。（程下。）
    古（自言自语）：啊呀，这回要是成功了，又不化一个钱，又不化一个工，就在自家船上装个土机器，沈大嫂可捞着了。
    （副班长与战士们拥上）
    战士们：副班长，站到坡上来看，站的高，看的远。
    杨：伙计，看，好快呀！
    李：行呀，装上土轮船，就比划子快一倍！
    林：中呀，连旱鸭子都会划！
    战士们（鼓掌）：划的好，划的妙，旱鸭子，再划快些要不要？
    （幕后：“要得！”笑声，掌声。）
    古：同志们，拉我一把，让我也开开眼界。
    （程百合与沈大嫂上）
    程：副班长，你可办了一件天大的事呀，你行，你行，从古到今，也没人想到把船上按一个土机器，解放军真是有勇有谋，什么事也难不住你们，这次过长江，一定是过成了，过成了。
    古：程老头，当真快不快？
    程：快！
    古：好不好？
    程：好！
    古（回头拉住沈）：沈大嫂，你捞住了。（又转身拉王）副班长，副班长，一会你把我这只船也给装上一个土机器！
    （幕后歌声）
    --幕--
