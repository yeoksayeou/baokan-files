　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The first six months of the fourth year of Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan are marked by new progress in the socialist economy. During the implementation of the plan for the first quarter of this year, Soviet industry exceeded the new, already-raised plan by two percent in terms of total output. Although the achievements of the second quarter's work have not yet been summarized, thousands of factories and manufacturing plants had reported exceeding the six-month industrial plan long before the end of the first half of this year.

　　The socialist competition to complete Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, which is being carried out on an unprecedented scale, is achieving remarkable results every day. More than two thousand enterprises had already completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule last year. The entire Moscow industry reached the average monthly output level of 1950—the last year of the post-war Five-Year Plan—in April. The patriotic initiative of the Moscow people to determine that they would complete the task of the Five-Year Plan in four years has received widespread response throughout the country. Thousands of enterprises have vowed to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years in terms of total production.

　　The past half-year has been marked by a new and powerful spirit of creative initiative among the broad masses of Soviet working people. The movement to accelerate the turnover of working capital has been greatly expanded in the first half of this year. Thanks to better production standards, the application of new technologies, and better organization and management of industry, Soviet workers have withdrawn billions of rubles into the State Bank. The initiative of the workers of the Kolomna and Sormovo factories to guarantee the manufacture of several locomotives and ships with saved raw materials has received enthusiastic response throughout the country.

　　This year, the Soviet people have once again recognized many new patriots, industrial reformers—first-class Stakhanovite movement members—who are bravely creating new methods in technology and production organization. Under the initiative of Zhutkik, the deputy foreman of the Moscow textile factory, a mass movement to produce high-quality products was launched. Textile worker Rozhneva and weaver Kononenko were the first to initiate a competition to save raw materials in light industry. Vladimir Voroshin initiated a movement for higher industrial standards. The creative cooperation of workers in science and industry is growing and developing. Scientific institutions have established direct links with industrial and transportation enterprises, thereby facilitating technological progress and the most rapid implementation of the Five-Year Plan.

  　苏联工业超过半年计划
    劳动人民保证五年计划今年完成
    【新华社北平四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：斯大林战后五年计划第四年的头六个月，是以社会主义经济新的进展为标志的。在执行本年第一季的计划期间，就总产量来说，苏联工业超过了新的已予提高的计划百分之二。第二季工作的成就虽尚未总结出来，但在今年上半年结束以前，老早就有数以千计的工厂和制造厂报告超过六个月的工业计划。
    以空前的规模开展着的争取先期完成斯大林战后五年计划的社会主义竞赛，每天都获得显著的成果。有两千种以上的企业在去年就已先期完成了五年计划。整个莫斯科工业在四月份就已达到了一九五○年——战后五年计划最后一年的每月平均产量水平。莫斯科人民确定他们要在四年之内完成五年计划的任务，这种爱国主义的创举，在全国获得了广泛的响应。数以千计的企业发誓在生产总量方面在四年内完成五年计划。
    过去的半年是以苏联广大劳动群众的创造性的创举这一种新的强有力的精神为标志的。加速流动基金周转的运动，在今年上半年是大大地扩展了。由于更好的生产标准，由于应用新技术，由于更好地组织和管理工业，苏联工人业已抽出亿万的卢布存于国家银行中。科洛姆纳和索尔莫沃工厂的工人保证以节省的原料来制造几个火车头和船只的倡议，在全国获得了热烈的响应。
    今年苏联人民又认识了许多新的爱国者、工业改革者——第一流的斯塔哈诺夫运动者——名字，他们在技术和生产组织方面勇敢地创造着新的方法。在莫斯科纺织工厂副领班朱特基克的倡议下，发动了生产上等质量产品的群众运动。纺工罗日涅娃和织工科诺年科是首先在轻工业中发起节省原料竞赛的。伏拉狄米尔·沃罗辛发起了高等工业标准的运动。在科学与工业中工人创造性的合作在日益增长和发展中。科学机关与工业和运输企业建立了直接的联系，从而便利了技术的进展，便利了五年计划的最迅速执行。
