    Prevention of Infantile Diarrhea in Summer and Autumn
    Tong Yuheng
    In rural areas, the number of infantile diseases is quite large every summer and autumn, often exceeding the number of adult diseases in many areas. Gastrointestinal diseases occur most frequently in infants and young children aged one to three during the summer and autumn, and diarrhea accounts for the vast majority of gastrointestinal diseases. For example, a survey of five villages in Raoyang and Shenxian counties in central Hebei in 1947 showed that out of 300 infants and young children aged one to three, 215 suffered from diarrhea, of which 178 were caused by the same kind of reasons. This simple survey is as follows:
    First, Symptoms:
    The symptoms of the above patients are generally the same. They defecate several to dozens of times a day, with thin stools that are green in color and contain undigested food residue, or are mixed with yellowish-white flocs and mucus. In severe cases, the amount of defecation is very large, resulting in severe dehydration. Severe cases lose more than one pound of body weight per day, with obvious emaciation, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever, ranging from 38 to 40 degrees Celsius. Some also have frequent convulsions. Others include coma or restlessness. Secondary complications include rectal prolapse, which occurred in 18 out of 178 people, and near-onset head boils.
    Second, Causes:
    1. Inappropriate Breastfeeding: Rural women lack knowledge of breastfeeding and have not developed good breastfeeding habits for infants. Generally, they breastfeed whenever the child cries, even if it is not time to eat, believing that the more and more frequently the child eats, the fatter they will become. Not only is the time too short, but the amount is also excessive. In addition, summer and autumn are often the busy farming seasons for rural women. They are anxious to work in the fields every day and neglect to take care of their children. The time for breastfeeding has to be extended too long. When breastfeeding, they try their best to feed the child until full. Overeating or starvation affects the digestion and absorption of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to diarrhea.
    Children need sufficient water in summer, but mothers do not know to feed them water frequently. Children greedily suck a large amount of milk when breastfeeding. Too much milk cannot be fully digested and absorbed, leading to diarrhea. Another reason is insufficient water supply, which makes it difficult for the body to excrete waste, resulting in various poisoning phenomena and diarrhea.
    2. Unhygienic Diet: Infants who are not old enough to be weaned are forcibly weaned for other reasons. Due to economic constraints, they cannot obtain milk, milk substitutes, etc., and have to be fed ordinary food, such as noodles, porridge, or steamed buns chewed by adults. Because the above foods are not suitable for children's gastrointestinal tracts, they cause digestive difficulties and lead to diarrhea.
    Children who have been weaned have not developed the habit of eating on time, and are allowed to eat snacks at any time according to their individual preferences, which affects formal meals. They also eat a lot each time, exceeding their daily required food intake. The food they eat is often not suitable for children's appetites, such as cornbread, biscuits, sorghum cakes, and indigestible rice and vegetables. Undigested food ferments in the abdomen, causing bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea.
    Mothers lack hygiene knowledge and feed their children unclean melons and fruits, drink cold water, and eat spoiled food (such as old fish, meat, and leftover food), which directly introduces bacteria and causes diarrhea.
    3. Cold, Dampness, and Heat: Generally, children are prone to diarrhea in summer. External stimulation from high heat reduces gastric acid secretion, making it easier for bacteria to grow and cause diarrhea. When rural women are busy with farming, they hand over their children to older children, who take them everywhere to play, running around in the hot sun, damp places, and dirty pits and toilets, exposing the children to heat and dampness. In addition, children catch cold at night and do not pay attention to dressing them on rainy days, still going around naked, causing diarrhea after the abdomen is exposed to cold.
    4. Direct Transmission from Mothers and Other Infections: Mothers do not pay enough attention to personal hygiene, especially when they are sick, and often directly transmit diseases to their children. When mothers have diarrhea, they do not pay attention to or know how to prevent it in their children. Bacteria are transmitted through the nipples and by feeding children chewed food, and contaminated hands come into contact with children's food utensils and food. In addition, eating food or utensils that flies have crawled on, or children coming into contact with other sick children and adults, can also lead to infection. After working in the hot weather, mothers sweat, feel hot, and tired, but immediately breastfeed their infants when they return home. This is what the common people call "hot milk." Infants often develop diarrhea after eating this "hot milk."
    5. Inadequate Care: The child already has indigestion or mild diarrhea, but the adults do not know how to take care of them and continue to feed them a large amount of milk as usual, nor do they let them rest properly, which leads to the condition worsening. Furthermore, due to the current economic situation, pigsties, donkey sheds, and toilets in rural families are all in one small yard, and some people even live in the inner room with donkeys or cows living in the outer room. The home is naturally very unsanitary, which directly affects the cleanliness of the child's food and greatly increases the chances of bacterial infection, thus promoting the occurrence of diarrhea.
    Third, Prevention and Treatment:
    After the onset of the disease, a hunger therapy of 12 to 24 hours should be implemented (this is a very important treatment method). For drug treatment, castor oil, bismuth subnitrate, and tannalbin can be used. However, to eradicate the disease, in addition to certain treatments, the basic problem is to pay attention to how to prevent it. The prevention of diarrheal diseases is very simple. The best way to prevent is to let rural women understand the above causes of the disease and prevent and eliminate them. For example, pay attention to covering the child's belly at night, and if the child has diarrhea, let them fast for 12 to 24 hours... Pay attention to the child not eating spoiled food and snacks, especially pay attention to not letting flies crawl over the child's food. These problems are easy to do. The peasants who have been liberated have already made such demands: "How to make children healthy and grow up quickly to build a new China!" This also shows that peasants have spontaneously needed health knowledge. The current development of rural health publicity and education work is the prerequisite for prevention work. It is hoped that governments at all levels, while attaching importance to rural health work, will include rural health publicity and education work as part of the government's publicity and education work, and provide two specific suggestions: 1. Organize the assignment of health publicity work to schools, and reflect it to every family through school teachers and students. 2. Promote through women's associations: Because mothers care most about their children, they will definitely do a good job. First, let them understand some childcare methods and women's hygiene knowledge, and then let them carry out extensive publicity, and let the women's associations conduct timely and necessary inspections. If rural women have some hygiene knowledge and know how to prevent, it is equivalent to many health agencies and doctors.
    Our doctors should also use practical examples in treatment, instructing the mothers on the causes of the disease and how to take care of and simply treat diarrhea and other diseases.

    夏秋季小儿腹泻的预防
    佟愚恒
    在农村里面，每年夏秋季小儿发病数是相当大的，不少的地区经常超过成人发病数，一至三岁的婴幼儿在夏秋中发生的胃肠病占总发病数的最大多数，而腹泻又在胃肠病中的绝大比重。如一九四七年在冀中饶阳、深县的五个村调查：在三百个一至三岁的婴幼儿内，有二百一十五人中患着腹泻，其中有一百七十八人都是由同样性质的原因而引起的。这个简单的调查情况如下：
    第一、症候：
    以上患者数中，其经过症候大抵一样，一日排便数次至数十次，便稀薄且带绿色，有不消化食物之残渣，或混有黄白色絮块及粘液，重症者排便量甚大，因之脱水甚剧，重症者每日体重减轻一磅以上，显明的消瘦、呕吐、腹痛，发热，由三八——四十度，尚有的痉挛频繁发作，其他如神识昏迷或惊厥不宁。续发症有脱肛，一百七十八人中有十八人，及近发性头部疖肿。
    第二、原因：
    一、哺乳不适当：农村妇女缺乏喂奶知识，也就还没养成乳儿良好的吃奶习惯，一般的只要孩子一哭，便喂奶，不到吃的时间，也硬给吃，认为孩子越吃勤一些，越多吃些才会胖起来；不仅时间过短，而且量也超过。此外夏秋季又多是农妇从事农忙季节，每天急于地里作活，忽略了对孩子的照顾，给孩子喂奶的时间，不得不拉得过长，一喂时则拚命给孩子吃个饱，过饥过饱，影响胃肠的消化吸收而腹泻。
    夏天孩子需要充足的水份，可是母亲不懂得经常喂水，孩子在吃奶时便贪吮大量的乳液，由乳液过多，不能全部消化吸收，便发生腹泻，另一种亦是因水份供给不足，体内废物排泻困难，发生种种中毒现象而腹泻。
    二、饮食不卫生：不够断奶年龄的婴儿，因其他原因，强制断奶，又因经济所限，得不到牛乳、代乳粉等，不得不喂一般食物，如面条、稀饭或成人嚼过的饽饽等，因以上食物不适于小儿胃肠，致成消化困难而致腹泻。
    已断奶的孩子，未养成按时吃饭的习惯，任其个性的随时吃零食，影响正式吃饭，又每次吃得很多，超过其一日所需饭量，吃的东西多不适于小儿的胃口，如窝头、饼子、黍面饼及难消化的饭、菜等，不消化食物在腹内发酵，因之鼓肠、呕吐、腹泻。
    母亲们没有卫生常识，给孩子乱食不洁的瓜果，喝冷水，以及腐败的食物（如陈旧的鱼、肉、剩饭菜等），因直接吞入微菌发生腹泻。
    三、受凉、受潮湿、受热：一般的夏季中小儿容易患腹泻，体外受到高热的刺激使胃酸分泌减少，因之微菌容易滋生发生腹泻。农妇们农忙时把小孩子交给大点的孩子，他们带着小孩子到处玩，到处跑，在炎热的日下，潮湿的地方，污秽的坑厕等处，使孩子受热受湿，另外孩子夜间受凉，雨天的时候不注意给孩子穿衣服，仍光着身子，腹部受凉后腹泻。
    四、母亲的直接传染，及其他传染：母亲们对个人卫生注意不够，尤其生病时，经常直接传染到孩子身上。母亲患腹泻时，不注意同时也不知道怎样注意给孩子防预，由乳头，及将嚼过的东西喂孩子，带菌的手接触小儿的食具、食物。另外食用苍蝇爬过的食物或食具等，再者孩子接触其他生病孩子，大人而传染。母亲们在炎热的气候农作后，全身出汗、发热、疲劳，可是回家后即给婴儿喂乳，这就是老百姓所谓“热奶”婴儿吃此“热奶”后常常发生腹泻。
    五、护理不周到：孩子本来已发生消化不良现象，或轻度腹泻，大人不知怎样对其护理，仍照常的给大量奶吃，也不令其好好休息，便由轻转重，再者因当前经济情况的限制，农村中家庭猪圈、驴棚、厕所都在一小院内，还有的人住在里间，驴或牛住在外间，家里当然很不卫生，这样直接影响孩子的食物清洁，细菌感染的机会很多，因此促成患腹泻之极大原因。
    第三、预防及治疗：
    发病后应施行十二小时至二十四小时的饥饿疗法（这是很重要的治疗办法），药物治疗，可用些蓖麻油、次硝酸铋，及单那尔宾等。但欲杜绝本病，除一定的治疗外，基本问题应注意如何预防。对腹泻病的预防是很简单的，怎样使农妇们了解以上发病原因，而去防与消灭，这便是最好的预防法。如晚上注意给孩子盖好肚子，孩子已发生腹泻，令其间食十二时至二十四时……注意孩子不吃腐败食物及零食，尤其是注意不让苍蝇爬过孩子食品，这些问题都是容易作到的。翻身后的农民已经有了这样的要求：“如何使孩子健康，赶快长大起来建设新中国！”也就说明了农民已自发的需要卫生知识。当前开展农村的卫生宣传教育工作，便是预防工作的前题。希望各级政权在重视乡村卫生工作的情况下，把乡村卫生宣教工作，列为政权宣教工作的一部份，并提供两点具体建议：一、有组织的把卫生宣传工作布置给学校，通过学校教员及学生，反映到每人的家庭。二、通过妇会组织宣传：因为母亲最关心孩子，她们一定会作好。首先使她们懂得一些育儿方法，以及妇女卫生常识，再由她们作广泛宣传，并由妇会作随时的必要的检查。使农妇有些卫生常识，而会预防，那不知等于多少卫生机关及医生。
    我们的医生在治疗中也应本实际例子，就其原因令其注意，并要慢慢教育母亲们如何学会护理及对腹泻等病简单的治疗。
