　　Beiping Democratic Women's Federation Preparatory Committee Resolution
  　Welcoming the Asian Women's Conference
    Assisting the National Women's Federation in Completing Conference Preparations
    [Beiping News] The Beiping Democratic Women's Federation Preparatory Committee yesterday (26th) passed a resolution supporting the holding of the Asian Women's Conference in China. The person in charge of the association told reporters: The decision of the International Democratic Women's Federation to hold the Asian Women's Conference in China in early December of this year shows the consolidation and expansion of the world peace camp led by the Soviet Union. Asia accounts for more than half of the world's total population. The victory of the Asian people is an important part of the victory of the people of the world, and the convening of the Asian Women's Conference, which represents half of the Asian population, will strengthen the unity of women and people in Asia and accelerate the victory of the Asian people's struggle for national independence, democracy, and peace. It will further expose and defeat all war and adventure conspiracies of the imperialist aggression camp headed by US imperialism, and accelerate the demise of imperialist criminal rule in Asia. For many years, imperialists have brought national oppression, political enslavement, economic exploitation, and bloody suppression of national liberation movements to the people of Asia. Asian women and children have suffered extremely heavy disasters as a result. Recently, in the face of the unprecedented victory of the Asian people, especially the Chinese people's liberation war, US imperialism has pieced together the reactionary running dogs of China, the Philippines, and Korea, attempting to organize these reactionary remnant forces to form a so-called Pacific anti-communist alliance to make a desperate struggle. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups in Asia must develop patriotism, expel the aggressive forces of imperialism, and strive for and defend the independence of their countries; in particular, the Chinese people should quickly, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the reactionary remnant forces of imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. On the other hand, the people of all ethnic groups in Asia must also develop the spirit of internationalism, unite the forces of the world peace camp, and smash the reactionary alliance of US imperialism and its running dogs to defend world peace. The Beiping Democratic Women's Federation Preparatory Committee will intensify the following work in the next four months to welcome the convening of the Asian Women's Conference: (1) Call on and organize Beiping women to strengthen their work in various economic, political, and cultural positions; (2) Widely carry out propaganda combining patriotism and internationalism and education in international knowledge among women; (3) Assist the National Democratic Women's Federation in completing all preparations for the conference. The one million women of Beiping will receive sisters from all countries with high enthusiasm and cordial friendship.

　　北平民主妇联筹委会决议
  　迎接亚洲妇女会议
    协助全国妇联完成大会准备工作
    【平市讯】北平市民主妇联筹委会昨（二十六）日通过决议，拥护亚洲妇女会议在中国召开。该会负责人对记者发表谈话称：国际民主妇联本年十二月初，在中国召开亚洲妇女会议的决定，说明了以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的巩固与扩大。亚洲人口占全世界总人口二分之一以上，亚洲人民的胜利是全世界人民胜利的一个重要部分，而代表亚洲半数人口的亚洲妇女会议的召开，必将加强全亚洲妇女与人民的团结，并加速亚洲人民争取民族独立、民主与和平的斗争的胜利；必将进一步揭穿与击破以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义侵略阵营一切战争冒险的阴谋，并加速帝国主义在亚洲罪恶统治的覆灭。多少年来，帝国主义者给亚洲人民带来了民族压迫、政治奴役、经济榨取以及对各民族解放运动的血腥镇压，亚洲妇女与儿童因此所受的灾难极为惨重。最近，在亚洲人民、首先是中国人民解放战争空前胜利的形势下，美帝国主义又把中、菲、朝鲜的反动走狗们捏在一起，企图组织这些反动残余力量，结成所谓太平洋反共同盟，以作垂死的挣扎。因此，亚洲各民族的人民，必须发挥爱国主义精神，驱逐帝国主义的侵略势力，争取并保卫本国的独立；尤其是中国人民应该迅速坚决彻底干净全部地肃清帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的反动残余势力；另一方面，亚洲各民族的人民就必须同时发挥国际主义精神，联合全世界和平阵营的力量，去粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的反动同盟，以保卫世界和平。北平市民主妇联筹委会将在未来的四个月当中，加紧下列工作，以迎接亚洲妇女会议的召开：（一）号召与组织北平妇女加强经济、政治、文化各种岗位上的工作；（二）在妇女群众中广泛进行爱国主义与国际主义相结合的宣传和国际知识的教育；（三）协助全国民主妇联完成大会的一切准备工作。北平一百万妇女，将以高度的热诚与亲切的友谊，来接待各国姊妹们的来临。
