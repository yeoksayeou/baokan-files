Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th: The People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanjing held a grand military parade on the afternoon of the 6th to commemorate the 12th anniversary of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the 3rd anniversary of the People's Liberation War. General Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, delivered a speech to the troops participating in the review at the parade. He said: We must oppose American imperialism's support for the revival of Japanese aggression forces, and advocate the prompt convening of a foreign ministers' conference with representatives from the new China to prepare for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. He called on all commanders and fighters to continue advancing, eliminate the Kuomintang's remaining forces, and capture Chiang Kai-shek and other key war criminals alive. In his speech, Commander Liu demanded that the entire army resolutely protect the interests of the people, strictly abide by mass discipline and urban policies, continue to uphold and promote the fine tradition of hard work and plain living, intensify learning, improve military skills, raise political and cultural levels, and build a regularized and modernized national defense force.

The parade began at 5:30 PM. Infantry, motorized units, tank and armored vehicle corps, American-style howitzer regiments, and American-style mountain gun regiments of the People's Liberation Army, all equipped with modern equipment, converged from Guanghua Gate Ming Palace Airport along Zhongzheng Road toward the Xinjiekou reviewing stand. Although it rained heavily in the afternoon, the citizens who came to watch were still shoulder to shoulder. The windows of buildings along the streets extending more than ten li in all directions from the Xinjiekou intersection were packed with spectators. The reviewed troops were neatly dressed and full of energy, marching forward past the reviewing stand to the sound of military music. The audience on both sides shouted "Salute to the People's Liberation Army!" The applause was unending, and many women threw flowers to the marching soldiers. When the motorized units, howitzer regiments, and tank regiments, equipped with new American-style heavy weapons seized from the Kuomintang bandit army, marched past, the people cheered with particular enthusiasm. The sound of tank and car engines mingled with shouts and applause. At night, congratulatory colored lanterns with five-pointed red stars and red flags at the entrances of various shops decorated the city in a magnificent and splendid manner.
