Catching "Demons" and Seizing "Evil"
	Sun Fuzhen

	"Ghosts" Haunt Cizhou Village
	In Liu Hailan's house in the front street of Cizhou Village, Weinan First District, two fires broke out within ten days in August last year. Once, the cotton-padded coat that Hailan had placed on top of the cabinet caught fire, and the second time, the quilt on Hailan and his wife's bed caught fire. Both times, Hailan's wife, Li Xiuhua, discovered them first and quickly extinguished them, preventing a major fire. Most of the family members couldn't figure out why the fires started, so they believed it was "divine fire." The whole family became vigilant, burning incense to the "Fire God" and being very careful with the lights. But then "evil" appeared in the kitchen. Rice and flour would be thrown on the ground when someone carried them, and steamed buns would disappear without a trace. At first, it was only two or three missing, but the most serious incident was when Hailan's mother checked the buns in the kitchen and personally saw the basket shaking automatically, with five buns missing. After searching everywhere, they found them in the straw basket. The neighbors secretly discussed: "There's a 'phantom' in Hailan's house." In October, seven out of eight of Hailan's rice bowls disappeared, and Xiuhua found them in the toilet. In November, the cooking pot disappeared, and Xiuhua found it in the firewood pile of her neighbor, Aunt Dongfang. Once, the whole family was eating. They ate the rice first, then drank the soup. When they were about to serve the soup, four donkey dung pellets appeared in the pot. On the seventh day of the twelfth lunar month, the sky was gloomy, the north wind was blowing snowflakes, and it was dark. Xiuhua wasn't working and didn't light the lamp, so she went to bed early. While she was sleeping, she suddenly howled, waking up Hailan's family and clearly audible to the neighbors. Several families carefully used ash to surround their doors. Xiuhua howled until dawn. They asked a "shaman" to examine her, and he found a nail stuck in her left ear. The "shaman" recited a "spell," removed the nail, and Xiuhua stopped howling. This incident quickly caused a sensation throughout the village. Some people suspected, "Could it really be like that?" But most people said, "Gods and ghosts are not to be trifled with." They also said, "It must be that Xiuhua has a calamity." None of the neighbors dared to casually visit Hailan's house, and when Hailan's family visited neighbors, they were often driven away, fearing they would bring disaster.

	"Shaman's" Magic Doesn't Work
	Someone said, "One thing overcomes another; if there's evil in the house, you should invite a shaman!" Liu Hailan was "scared out of his wits" and was willing to spend all his family's wealth to catch "demons" and seize "evil." After autumn last year, he invited Sun Runshen from Liuxiang Village, Seventh District of Hua County, twice to catch "demons." Sun, the "shaman," said that a "fox spirit" had pounced on Li Xiuhua, that Xiuhua had lost her true soul, and would definitely not survive the 38th year of the Republic of China (1949). He also said that Xiuhua's blood and energy were definitely not flowing properly. After Xiuhua, Hailan, and others repeatedly begged, Sun, the "shaman," pointed to the sky and drew on the ground, reciting "sacrificial incantations." Sometimes he stomped his feet, sometimes he blew air, and sometimes he glared, his mustache twitching. But no matter how he used his "magic," he didn't catch the fox spirit. In November last year, Hailan also invited Lian Ximeng from Lian Village, First District of Weinan. He was an old "shaman" with twenty years of experience, saying he had "closed eyes," could recite "true scriptures," and could "spray magic" from his mouth. After arriving at Hailan's house, having wine and food, he held his hands together, squinted his eyes, sat cross-legged, sometimes punching and kicking, pinching "symbols," and reciting "incantations." Finally, he said to Hailan's family: "I saw a god, red-faced, with a white beard, three feet tall. I haven't seen this great immortal in twenty years, no magic descended, no magic descended, a great vow must be made!" After saying this, he walked away. Hailan's house was still haunted by "ghosts." During the Lunar New Year, they invited Wei Minglun from Heiweizhuang, Seventh District of Weinan, saying he could see "yin and yang feng shui" and could catch "demons" on the spot. They brought him to Liu's house one evening. First, he looked at the house foundation, saying that the front yard had to be blocked from the backyard so that people couldn't walk the "ghost" path. Then he ascended the "magic altar," ordered Hailan to light an oil lamp, moved a guillotine, placed yellow paper on the blade, and drove the crowd outside. After reciting the "French language," he ordered Xiuhua to crawl through the blade. Then, the guillotine blade fell. At this time, Wei Minglun shouted: "Evil ghost, where are you escaping!" The crowd rushed forward, and there were bloodstains on the yellow paper. Everyone was surprised, feeling that this time everything should be fine. But Hailan's house was a "demon cave," still losing things and being uneasy. Later, although they invited the witch from Guo Liantun and Li Haicheng from the village, everyone used the same tricks, and no one caught the "demon."

	"Monster Caught in the Net"
	When such strange problems appeared among the masses, the People's Government naturally wanted to find a solution. Starting with the "divine fire," it attracted the attention of the local district government. Later, the county government also sent people to participate in the investigation of this incident. After detailed investigation and research, and the proof of many facts, the entire case was solved this spring. Guess what? It turned out that the "monster" was Li Xiuhua herself. Now let her describe what happened! Xiuhua said: When I was seventeen, my brother arranged for me to marry Liu Hailan. Before I married, I didn't know anyone, let alone what kind of temper they had. He went to Xinxiang less than two months after I married, and didn't come back until April last year. By August, he would quarrel with me whenever he saw me and hit me for no reason. I didn't like him anyway, and I was fed up with him as soon as I saw him. I didn't dare to mention divorce because I was afraid he would hit me and because I was afraid my parents wouldn't agree. I didn't know how to get a divorce, so I just smashed things every day and didn't work properly. One night in August, I went to the cabinet to get something and knocked his coat onto the lamp. I picked it up and put it back on the cabinet. Later, it caught fire. I didn't dare to admit it and went along with saying it was "divine fire." I'm only twenty years old this year, and I can't live like this for the rest of my life. His family is superstitious, and I thought, "If you're not afraid of a hard head, you're not afraid of a fan," and my aunt on my mother's side is a witch. "Even though I haven't eaten pork, I've seen pigs run," so I pretended to be a ghost to scare them. The second "divine fire" was when I threw the lamp wick on the bed. Also, my mother-in-law didn't treat her daughter-in-law well and was biased, not letting me eat my fill, so I stole a bun to eat. At first, I stole one or two, but later, since they said there was "evil," and I felt that stealing wasn't safe, I stole four or five at a time to keep for myself to eat. Now that the government has investigated everything, I'll tell the truth. I deliberately scattered the rice and flour, I hid the bowls and pots, I threw the donkey dung pellets into the pot, and I stuck the iron nail into my own ear to scare Liu Hailan. I knew what I was doing, and wouldn't hurt my ear. Government cadres asked her: "Do you believe in the shamans catching 'demons' and seizing 'evil'?" She said: "I knew the witches and shamans were fake. To get a divorce, I pretended to be scared and cried. The shaman said my blood and energy weren't flowing properly, that's a lie."

	The Truth Revealed
	After the truth came to light, several shamans also revealed the inside story of their deception. In his reflection, Sun Runshen said: "I saw a big elm tree in his house, so I thought of saying she was a fox spirit. I deliberately spoke fiercely to get them to invite me more often and make a big vow. Saying her blood and energy weren't flowing properly, that's nonsense, because women 'often have leucorrhea,' and young people often have irregular periods. Reciting the incantations is fake, since I don't make any sound, no one knows what I'm saying." Lian Ximeng said: "Because his house had caught fire, I said there was a red-faced ghost, letting them guess it was the Fire God, which would definitely lead them to make a big vow." Wei Minglun said: "His house was often missing things, so I said blocking the front and back yards would be good. The blood on the yellow paper was because I took a piece of alkali, recited the incantation, and put the alkali in my mouth. When bending over to cut with the guillotine, I dabbed it on the paper. Yellow paper turns red when it encounters alkali, and who can see clearly at night?"

	After the government investigated this case, the government announced the criminal behavior of the witches and gods at a mass meeting in the village and criticized Li Xiuhua's mistake of pretending to be "evil" and playing "ghosts," pointing out that this was not a proper way to solve the problem. At the same time, Liu Hailan was criticized for his maltreatment of women. Based on Li Xiuhua's proposal, the government has now ruled that Li Xiuhua and Liu Hailan are divorced.

    捉“妖”拿“邪”
    孙福臻
    慈周寨闹“鬼”
    卫南一区慈周砦村前街刘海兰家，去年八月间，十天着了两次火。一次烧了海兰在柜顶上放着的棉袄，再一次烧了海兰夫妇床上的被子，这两次都是海兰媳妇李秀花首先发现，才很快扑灭，没出火灾。家里人多半弄不清为啥着火，因此认为是“神火”。全家人都警惕了，除给“火神爷”烧香外，都很小心灯火。可是厨房里又出了“邪”，米面一背了人就抛在地下，馍馍不冀而飞。起初短两三个，最严重的一次是海兰娘到厨房查馍馍时，亲眼看见篮子还在自动的摇摆着，馍馍短了五个，找来找去，从草篓里找出来。邻居们偷偷议论：“海兰家有了皮搭虎子”。十月，海兰家八个吃饭碗没了七个，秀花从厕所里找了出来。十一月，做饭锅没了，秀花从隔壁东方婶婶家的柴草堆中找出来。有一次全家正吃饭，先吃饭，后喝汤，最后盛汤时，锅里出现了四个驴粪蛋，腊月初七，天阴沉沉的，北风吹着雪花，天黑了，秀花没有做活，也没点灯，早早的睡了。正睡着觉，她忽然嚎起来，惊醒海兰一家人，四邻人家也都听得很清楚。有好几家小心翼翼的用灰围住了自己的门。秀花嚎到天明，请“端公”一看，她左耳朵里塞着个钉，“端公”念了个“咒”，把钉取出来，秀花也就不嚎了。这个事很快哄动了全村，群众有的怀疑：“怕不是这么回事吧”？但依多数群众说：“神鬼不是好惹的”。又说：“该着秀花她有灾”。邻居们谁也不敢到海兰家去闲串，海兰家的人去串邻也往往被逐出来，怕带去灾难。
    “端公”法术不灵
    有人说：“一物克一物，家里有邪就该请端公”！刘海兰是“吓破胆了”，情愿把家产花光花净也得捉“妖”拿“邪”。去年秋后曾请滑县七区留香寨孙润申两次来捉“妖”。孙“端公”说是“狐狸精”扑到李秀花身上了，秀花已失了真魂，决活不出民国三十八年。又说秀花一定血气不活。经秀花、海兰等再三哀求，孙“端公”就指天划地，念着“祭言咒语”，有时跺脚，有时吹气，瞪眼，八字胡撅起，但是不管怎样使“法”，他并没有把狐狸精捉住，去年十一月海兰又请到卫南一区连庄连喜孟，他是一个有二十年历史的老“端公”，说他有“闭眼”，会念“真经法语”，又会满口“喷法”。他到海兰家酒饭过后，即双手捧起，两眼迷缝，盘腿打坐，有时拳打脚踢，掐“诀”，念“咒”，最后，他对海兰家说：“我看见一位神，红脸，白胡子，身高三尺，我二十年没见过这位大仙，没降法，没降法，非许大愿不可”！说罢扬长而走。海兰家还是闹“鬼”，旧历年关又请到卫南七区黑魏庄的魏明伦，说他会看“阴阳风水”，能当场捉“妖”，凑了个晚上把他请到刘家，先看宅基，说是前院须与后院堵死，人不能行“鬼”道。然后升座“法坛”，令海兰点上油灯，搬了一口铡，铡口放上黄表纸，把群众赶出门外，他念过“法语”就令秀花从铡口钻过去，接着铡刀落下来，这时，魏明伦大喊：“恶鬼那里逃！”众人趋前，黄表纸上竟然血迹斑斑，大家莫不奇怪，觉得这一次该万事大吉了。但海兰家是个“妖洞”，还是丢东少西不安生。后来，虽然又请过郭连屯的巫婆，本村的李海成，个个都是那一套，谁也没有捉住“妖”。
    “妖怪落网”
    群众中出现了这样奇怪的问题，人民政府当然是要想法解决的。从“神火”开始，便引起了当地区政府的注意。后来县政府也派人参加了这一事件的调查，经过详细调查研究，和许多事实的证明，今春已全案破获。你们猜怎么样？原来“妖怪”正是李秀花自己。现在让她来叙述一下事实经过吧！秀花说：我十七岁那年，俺哥哥作主把我许配给刘海兰，没过门时，谁也不认得谁，啥脾气更摸不清，过门不过两个月他就到新乡去了，去年四月才回来，过到八月，他看见我就吵，动不动就打，我呢，横竖看不中，一看见就够。离婚吧，俺不敢提，怕他打，又怕娘家不愿意，也不知怎么离法，只好每天摔摔打打的不好好做活。八月里一天晚上，我往柜里拿东西，把他的袄掉在灯上，我拾起来，就又放在柜上，后来着了火，我不敢承认，也随着说是“神火”。我今年才二十岁，不能若熬一辈子，他家人都迷信，我觉着“打破头不怕扇子扇”，俺娘家大娘是个巫婆，“我虽没吃过猪肉倒见过猪走”，就装起神鬼来吓虎他们。第二次“神火”是我将灯花丢在床上的。另外俺婆婆待儿媳妇不亲，有偏心眼，不让俺吃饱，我就偷个馍吃。起初俺偷一个半个的，后来，他们既说有“邪”，我又觉得偷不保险，就一下偷四五个放着吃。政府既然调查清了，我说实话吧，米面是我故意撒的，碗、锅是我藏的，驴粪蛋是我丢到锅里了，铁钉是我自己塞进耳朵里吓虎刘海兰的；我有分寸不会把耳朵塞坏的。政府干部问她：“端公捉‘妖’拿‘邪’，你信不信？”她说：我知道巫婆、端公是假的，为了离婚，我也装着害怕，哭叫。端公说我血气不活，那是放屁。
    原来如此
    真相大白后，几个端公也把他们欺骗的内幕道破了。在反省时，孙润申说：“我看见他家有棵大榆树，便想起来说她是狐狸精，我故意说的凶，是为的叫他们多请我几趟，许个大愿。说他血气不活，是因为妇女‘十人九带’，年轻人有几个月经不前提后错的？念咒是假的，横竖不出声，别人也不知道”。连喜孟说：“因为他家着过火，所以我说有个红脸鬼，让他们猜是火神爷，必定许个大愿。”魏明伦说：“他家好少东西，我就说前院后院堵住好。黄表纸上见血那是我拿了块大碱，念过咒，将碱放到嘴里。弯腰铡的时候往纸上点，黄表遇大碱，就变成红的，晚上谁能看清？”
    此案经政府查明后，政府即在该村群众大会上宣布巫神的罪恶行为，并批评了李秀花装“邪”弄“鬼”的错误，指出这不是解决问题的正当办法。同时批评了刘海兰虐待妇女的不是，当下根据李秀花的提议，政府已判决李秀花与刘海兰离婚。
