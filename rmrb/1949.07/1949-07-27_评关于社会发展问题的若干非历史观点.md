　　Critique of Several Non-Historical Views on Social Development
    Ai Siqi
    In the "Study and Discussion" column of the "Beiping Liberation Daily" on the 13th of this month, an article by Lan Sha entitled "Labor Created Man" was published. According to the editor's note, the discussion of this issue would end with that article, seemingly treating that article as a conclusion. If so, I think it is very inappropriate. Lan Sha's article quotes Engels's words, explaining how labor created man's process, that part has no problem, but some of the arguments he himself derived violate the basic viewpoints of historical materialism.
    After quoting a long passage from Engels, Lan Sha says this: "From this, it can be seen that man is really transformed from ape-men, and the saying that 'heaven,' 'god,' and 'essence of the sun and moon' created man is just a lie deliberately fabricated by the exploiting classes. The purpose of these lies is to fool the working people, to make the working people believe that exploiters are born to exploit people..." There is no problem in learning the truth that labor created man to break the absurd myths about the origin of mankind in religious superstition, and there is no problem that religious superstition is supported and used by the exploiting classes, but it cannot be concluded that religious superstition and various myths are merely things fabricated by the exploiting classes to deceive the exploited classes. The earliest origin of religious myths was in primitive communist society, when human society had not yet seen the emergence of classes. If it is believed that the exploiting class came first, and then this class fabricated religious myths, then there is no way to explain the primitive religions of primitive communist society—such as animism. How did the religion of primitive communist society arise? It reflected the state of human production development in primitive society. Engels said in "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State": "The clan system in its heyday, as we see it in America, presupposes a very undeveloped state of production, and thus only a sparse population scattered over a large area. Man is almost entirely dominated by nature, alien to him, incomprehensible to him; his simple religious ideas clearly reflect this." Therefore, according to the understanding of historical materialism, the emergence of religious myths, like all other social ideologies, reflects certain social material living conditions and is the inevitable product of a certain stage of social production development. At such a stage, mankind can only reflect some of its living content with that kind of explanation, fear, and longing for the world. The Marxist scientific truth that labor creates man can only be recognized by mankind under conditions of higher development of social material living conditions. Therefore, it is a violation of historical materialism to regard the emergence of religious myths merely as a phenomenon "deliberately" created by the exploiting classes to cover up the truth.
    From the above, it can be seen that religious myths first appeared when mankind was at an extremely low stage of material production. This is unavoidable in a certain historical stage of human development. In class society, the exploiting class in the ruling position extensively uses religious myths, giving them content suitable for the needs of its class rule, turning religion into a spiritual weapon to rule the people, and becoming spiritual opium to numb the people. However, on the other hand, contrary to Lan Sha's simple statement, a certain religion has at times manifested as the sigh and dream of the oppressed people, and they have taken religious forms of resistance against the old ruling class. Primitive Christianity in Europe and the earliest Buddhism in India were religions of slaves and laborers against oppression. A part of Taoism and superstitious myths in China also played an important role in peasant uprisings throughout the ages. The leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom also adopted primitive Christianity as a banner to resist the Manchu government and the old feudal system. These situations will naturally only occur when social material living conditions and the economic culture of the working masses are at a low level of development. In today's revolutionary masses, if anyone wants to use the form of religious myths to do mobilization and organization work, that is an absurd and reactionary act.
    Lan Sha's article also lacks a historical, even materialistic, view of the class exploitation system. He simply calls the statement about "those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others" a "reactionary heresy" and "poisonous thought," without recognizing that at a certain stage of human social development, the division and opposition of mental and physical labor is also an inevitable phenomenon. He said: "We have learned that labor creates man, and these poisonous thoughts are swept away. That is, we no longer believe that labor is only the responsibility of the working people (note: the grammar in these sentences reflects the author's ideological confusion.), but we will understand that in the beginning, everyone was working, and only after the occurrence of class society did there appear exploiters who do not work but enjoy themselves. Therefore, the working people should rise up to eliminate classes and the system of man exploiting man by revolutionary means." According to Lan Sha, it seems that the reason why class exploitation occurs in human society is only because mankind has made a mistake in thought, "believing" in an absurd heresy, thinking that labor is only the responsibility of the workers, and that exploiters have the right to be free from this responsibility. Therefore, as long as one morning, after learning that labor creates man and breaking the absurd heresy, one understands that exploiters also "should" share the responsibility of labor, one can mobilize the working people to eliminate classes and the system of man exploiting man, without asking about the development of social material life and political conditions.
    Learning the idea that labor creates man makes us understand that without labor, there would be no mankind. It makes it possible for us to further understand that the history of human social development is first and foremost the history of laborers and producers. The development of labor and production is the foundation of human historical development, and the activities of the working masses are the fundamental driving force of social development in any historical era. This strengthens our labor viewpoint and mass viewpoint, which is very important for guiding our revolutionary work and arousing the awakening of the working people. However, it cannot be concluded from this that the exploitation of laborers and producers is completely an accidental and absurd phenomenon in any historical era, and is merely the result of the working people being blinded by wrong ideas. All exploiting classes regard their own exploitation as a permanent and unchanging system, and regard "those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others" as an unshakable and unchangeable truth. Our Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism and historical materialism are revolutions of this kind of exploitative class dogma. However, we must know that the emergence of a certain exploitation system and the division and opposition of mental and physical labor are inevitable, lawful, and progressive under certain conditions of social material life development and at a certain stage of production development. Stalin said this about the slave exploitation system: "The slave system, as it now appears, is an absurd phenomenon, a stupid thing against nature. But the slave system, under the conditions of the disintegrating primitive commune system, is a completely understandable and lawful phenomenon, because it is a progress compared with the primitive commune." Stalin called this view a "historical viewpoint," and said: "Without this historical viewpoint of observing social phenomena, there is no possibility for historical science to exist and develop, because only this viewpoint can prevent science from becoming a confused account of accidental phenomena, and from becoming a pile of absurd and utterly ridiculous errors."
    From this, it can be seen that the emergence and elimination of class exploitation depend on certain social material living conditions. Various exploitation systems have existed in history. The slave-owning system was a step forward compared to the primitive commune system, the feudal exploitation system was a step forward compared to the slave exploitation system, and the capitalist exploitation system was a step forward compared to the feudal exploitation system. It was not until the emergence of this last type of exploitation system that the social conditions for eliminating human exploitation were created. Abstract and general statements about the exploitation system without historical analysis are undoubtedly very wrong. Every concrete exploitation system is eliminated under certain historical conditions, and it is not that the exploitation system "should" be eliminated at any time. When an exploitation system still plays a certain progressive role in social production development, it is not "should" be eliminated but precisely "should" exist and develop. The free capitalist exploitation system still has a certain role in the production development process in China today, so in the New Democratic Revolution, we did not propose the task of immediately eliminating all capitalist exploitation systems, but only proposed the task of eliminating imperialist, feudal, and bureaucratic capitalist exploitation. The task given to the proletariat by history is to finally eliminate all classes. However, the reason why this task can be put forward is not only because of the ideological awareness of the irrationality of the exploitation system and the "should" to completely eliminate classes, but mainly because the material living conditions of human society today are developing conditions for eliminating all classes, and at the same time, the working people, headed by the working class, also have the possibility to use their own efforts to promote and create these conditions. Ideological awareness itself is nothing more than a reflection of the development of these material conditions and political struggles. Therefore, our purpose in learning that labor creates man and learning the history of social development is not to generally "denounce" all exploitation systems and "denounce" all old ideas, calling them all unreasonable and deceptive. Our purpose is to correctly understand the laws of social development, correctly understand the laws of the struggle activities of laborers and producers in various historical periods, to understand under what social material living development conditions laborers were transformed from producers who were not exploited in the primitive commune to being exploited, and to understand how the production conditions created and developed by the working masses in various historical processes inevitably led to the replacement of one exploitation system by another, and finally created and developed high material living conditions for eliminating all classes and exploitation. From this, we can also understand: What kind of conditions should the working people in China today, headed by the working class, create in order to achieve this highest goal of obtaining their final liberation, and use this scientific understanding to guide our struggle, so that we can correctly and step by step transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society and a communist society.

　　评关于社会发展问题的若干非历史观点
    艾思奇
    “北平解放报”本月十三日的“学习讨论”栏里，登载了一篇蓝莎的“劳动创造了人”的文章，据编者的按语，说这个问题的讨论，就以那篇文章做结束，似乎是把那篇文章当做结论来发表的。如果这样，那我认为很不妥当。蓝莎的文章，引用了恩格斯的文字，说明劳动如何创造人的过程，那一部分倒没有什么问题，但他自己所引伸出来的一些论点，却违反了历史唯物主义的基本观点。
    蓝莎引了恩格斯的大段文章之后，这样说：“由此可见，人是实实在在由猿人转变而来的，‘天’、‘神’、‘日月精华’创造人的说法，只是剥削阶级故意捏造出来的谎语谎言。这些谎言的目的是在愚弄劳动人民，使劳动人民相信，剥削者生来就应当剥削人的……”学习劳动创造了人的真理，可以打破宗教迷信中关于人类起源的荒谬神话，这是没有问题的，宗教迷信受到剥削阶级的支持利用，这也是没有问题的，但并不能就得出结论，说宗教迷信和各种神话，仅仅是剥削阶级捏造出来欺骗被剥削阶级的东西，宗教神话的最早的起源，是在原始共产主义社会里，那时的人类社会还没有阶级出现。如果认为先有了剥削阶级，然后又才由这个阶级捏造出宗教神话，那就无从解释原始共产主义社会的原始宗教——例如万物有灵论。原始共产主义社会的宗教是怎样发生的呢？它是反映了原始社会人类生产发展的状况。恩格斯在“家族、私有财产及国家的起源”一书里说：“在全盛时代的氏族制度，如我们在美洲所见的，是以极未发达的生产状态，从而在广大地域上仅有稀薄的人口散布着为前提，人类差不多是由与他们无缘的为他们所不了解的自然所支配，他的简单的宗教观念，就是显然反映这个的。”所以，按照历史唯物主义的了解，宗教神话的出现，象一切其他社会思想意识形态一样，是反映着一定的社会物质生活条件，是社会生产发展的一定阶段的必然产物，在这样的阶段上，人类只能以那种对于世界的解释、恐惧和想望来反映自己的某些生活内容，象劳动创造人这种马克思主义的科学真理，只在社会物质生活条件更高发展的情形之下才能为人类所认识。所以，把宗教神话的出现仅仅看做是剥削阶级为掩蔽真理而“故意”造出来的现象，这是违背了历史唯物主义的说法。
    由上可见，宗教神话首先是出现于人类处在物质生产极低级的阶段。这在人类的一定历史发展阶段上，乃是不可避免的。在阶级社会里，居于统治地位的剥削阶级，就大规模地利用了宗教神话，使它有着适合于自己阶级统治需要的内容，把宗教变成为统治人民的精神上的武器，成为麻醉人民的精神上的鸦片。但是，在另一方面，又和蓝莎的简单说法相反，某种宗教在一定时候，又曾经表现为被压迫人民的叹息和梦想，他们反抗旧的统治阶级，采取了宗教的反抗形式。欧洲的原始基督教和印度最初的佛教，是奴隶劳动者反对压迫的宗教，中国的一部分道教和迷信神话，在历代农民暴动中也起过重要的作用。太平天国的领袖们也曾采用了原始基督教，作为反抗满清政府、反抗旧封建制度的旗帜。这些情形，自然只有在社会物质生活条件和劳动群众的经济文化都处于低度发展水平时才会产生。在今天的革命群众中，如果也有人想用宗教神话的形式来做动员组织工作，那就是荒谬绝伦的反动的行为了。
    蓝莎的文章中对于阶级的剥削制度的看法，也缺少历史主义的以至于唯物主义的观点。他把关于“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”这样事实的话简单的称做“反动的邪说”，“有毒的思想”，而没有认识到在人类社会发展的一定阶段上，劳心和劳力的分裂和对立也是必然的现象。他说：“我们学了劳动创造人，这些有毒思想，就是被扫清了。也就是再不相信，劳动只是属于劳动人民的责任（按：这些句子中的文法，乱反映作者的思想混乱。）而会了解，人类在最初的时候，每一个人都是劳动的，只有在阶级社会发生以后，才出现了不劳动而享乐的剥削者。因此，劳动人民应该起来用革命的办法去消灭阶级，消灭人剥削人制度。”照蓝莎这样说来，似乎人类社会之所以发生阶级剥削，只是由于人类思想上犯了错误，“相信”了一种荒谬的邪说，以为劳动只是属于劳动者的责任，而剥削者则有权脱离这个责任。所以，只要一天早上，学了劳动创造人，打破了这荒谬的邪说，就懂得剥削者也“应该”分有劳动的责任，就可以动员劳动人民起来消灭阶级消灭人剥削人制度，也不必问社会物质生活与政治条件的发展情况。
    学习了劳动创造人的思想，使我们懂得，没有劳动，就没有人类。使我们有可能进一步了解，人类社会的发展史，首先是劳动者、生产者的历史，劳动、生产的发展，是人类历史发展的基础，劳动群众的活动，是任何历史时代社会发展的根本动力，由此加强我们的劳动观点、群众观点，这对于我们的革命工作指导是很重要的，同时对于唤起劳动人民的觉醒是很重要的。但是，并不能由此就得出结论，说劳动者、生产者之被剥削，在任何历史时代都完全是偶然的荒谬现象，是仅仅由于劳动人民受了错误思想蒙蔽的结果。各种剥削阶级都把自己的剥削看做永久不变的制度，“把劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”看做不可动摇的天经地义；我们马克思列宁主义者的辩证唯物论与历史唯物论就是革了这类剥削阶级教条的命。但是，我们必须知道，一定剥削制度的出现，劳心和劳力的分裂和对立，在社会物质生活发展的一定条件之下，在生产发展的一定阶段，乃是必然的，合规律的，并且是具有进步意义的。斯大林关于奴隶剥削制度，这样说道：“奴隶制度，就现在条件看来，是很荒谬的现象，反乎自然的蠢事情。而奴隶制度在瓦解着的原始公社制度条件下，却是完全可以了解并且合于规律的现象，因为它和原始公社比较起来，是一个进步。”这样的看法，斯大林称之为“历史观点”，并且说：“如果没有这种观察社会现象的历史观点，那么，历史科学也就没有可能存在和发展，因为只有这样的观点，才能使科学不致变成一笔偶然现象的糊涂帐，不致变成一堆荒谬绝伦的错误。”
    由此可知，阶级剥削的产生和它的消灭，都依赖着一定的社会物质生活条件。历史上存在过各种的剥削制度，奴隶占有制度比原始公社的制度前进一步，封建的剥削制度比奴隶剥削制度又前进一步，资本主义的剥削制度又比封建的剥削制度更前进一步，而到了这最后一种剥削制度的出现，才造成了消灭人类剥削的社会条件。对于剥削制度的抽象的笼统的说法，而没有历史的分析，无疑是很错误的。每一个具体的剥削制度是在一定的历史条件下被消灭，而并不是剥削制度在任何时候都“应该”被消灭。当一种剥削制度在社会生产发展中还起着一定进步作用的时候，它就不是“应该”被消灭而恰恰是“应该”存在和发展的。自由资本主义的剥削制度在今天中国的生产发展过程中还具有一定的作用，所以我们在新民主主义革命运动中就没有提出立刻消灭一切资本主义剥削制度的任务，而只提出消灭帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义剥削的任务。历史给予无产阶级的任务，是要最后要消灭一切阶级。但这个任务之所以能够被提出来，并不仅仅是由于在思想上觉悟到剥削制度的不合理，觉悟到阶级之“应该”完全被消灭，而主要的是由于今天人类社会的物质生活条件中正发展着消灭一切阶级的条件，同时以工人阶级为首的劳动人民也有可能用自己的努力来促进和创设这些条件。思想上的觉悟，其本身也不外是这些物质条件与政治斗争的发展的反映。所以，我们学习劳动创造人，学习社会发展史，其目的并不是为要笼统的“骂倒”一切剥削制度，“骂倒”一切旧思想，一概称之为不合理的、骗人的。我们的目的是要正确地认识社会发展的规律，正确地认识劳动者、生产者在各个历史时期的斗争活动的规律，要了解劳动者是在什么样的社会物质生活发展条件之下由原始公社不受剥削的生产者变为被剥削者，了解劳动群众在各种历史过程中所创造发展起来的生产条件如何使一种剥削制度必然为另一种剥削制度所代替，而最后终于创造和发展了消灭一切阶级和剥削的高度的物质生活条件，由此我们也才能了解：今天中国以工人阶级为首的劳动人民应该创设一些什么样的条件，才可能达到获得自己最后解放的这一个最高目的，并且用这种科学的认识来指导我们的斗争，使我们正确地有步骤地经过新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会与共产主义社会。
