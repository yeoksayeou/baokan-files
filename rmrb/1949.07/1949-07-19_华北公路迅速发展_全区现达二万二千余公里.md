    Rapid Development of Highways in North China
    Total Length in the Region Now Exceeds 22,000 Kilometers
    [Report from this newspaper] North China's highway transportation is developing rapidly. From last winter to June of this year, to cooperate with the southward advance of the army, a total of 2,855 kilometers of highways were restored and constructed, along with 357 bridges. Currently, the entire North China region has 22,716 kilometers of highways (all within the scope of national and provincial roads, excluding county and village roads). Among these, there are 26 major highways, totaling over 14,400 kilometers, an increase of 177 percent compared to the pre-War of Resistance period and 48 percent longer than during the Japanese puppet regime. North China's highway transportation is responsible for exchanging materials between urban and rural areas. Currently, the entire North China region has 1,738 transport vehicles. Public companies in major cities have 917 rubber-wheeled horse carts, and private companies have 633, totaling over 30,000 carts including those in small and medium-sized cities and villages. This connects large, medium, and small cities with rural areas, plains with mountainous regions, enabling agricultural products and industrial raw materials from all parts of North China to be concentrated in small and medium-sized cities and then to large cities, with industrial products and machinery produced by large and medium-sized cities transported to small and medium-sized cities and rural areas. Among these 56 highways, they connect 47 coal and iron producing areas, 42 wheat and grain producing areas, 32 cotton, hemp, and flower producing areas, and 40 pig bristle, wool, and leather producing areas and distribution centers. Chestnuts, dried fruits, fruits, and persimmons on the Handan-Changzhi Highway and the Beiping-Suiyuan Highway, and salt, reed mats, cement, processed eggs, seafood, and fruits on the Tanggu-Yulin Highway are all exported to the Northeast. The Handan-Changzhi Highway passes through Wu'an, Shexian, Lucheng, Licheng, and enters the plains from the mountains, exchanging persimmon cakes, chestnuts, mung beans, eggs, and dried fruits from the mountains for wheat, cotton, and food grains from the plains. The 650-kilometer-long Beiping-Kaifeng Highway passes through the famous straw hat braid area and the jujube and peanut producing areas of the sandy region in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Plain.
