Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 22nd: The People's Liberation Army stationed in Yichang has maintained strict discipline, and revolutionary order has been rapidly established in the city. After a certain unit of the PLA occupied Yichang, it immediately established an Urban Work Committee and Garrison Headquarters, dispatching troops to guard municipal offices, newspaper offices, and warehouses, and to protect schools, the electric power company, and other public places, awaiting formal takeover by personnel. With the exception of troops remaining for garrison duty, all participating troops withdrew to outside the city that same day. Although the troops had marched and fought in several days of rain, enduring great hardship, they still strictly observed policies and discipline. Many units, because their military rations had not arrived in time, only had two meals of thin porridge each day, and declined the food offered to the troops by the citizens. The city is now stable, water and electricity are normal, and all shops have resumed normal business.

　　Urban-Rural Trade in Beiping City
    Reporter Tian Liu
    "Urban-Rural Mutual Assistance" is the main characteristic of the new urban-rural relationship in our liberated areas. Economic mutual assistance is specifically realized through urban-rural trade.
    In the past five months, trade between Beiping City and many small and medium-sized cities and vast rural areas in North China, as well as friendly neighboring regions such as Northeast, Northwest, Inner Mongolia, and East China, has developed rapidly and is thriving. According to extremely incomplete statistics, the Municipal Trading Company alone has transported over 160 million jin of grain, over 3.6 million jin of edible salt, over 400,000 jin of edible oil, 190,000 jin of tobacco leaves, and 40,000 jin of wool. If purchases made by the Municipal Trading Company in the market are included, the quantity will far exceed this number; private merchants' sales volume, estimated from the city's total consumption, is about twice this number. During the same period, industrial products exported by the Trading Company to rural areas included over 27,000 bolts of cotton cloth, over 3,200 bundles of yarn, over 4,600 dozens of socks, over 19,000 dozens of towels, over 1,400 boxes of matches, over 80,000 jin of alkali powder, and many other daily necessities such as vests, cigarettes, and vermicelli. The Trading Company's sales volume of these items in the market is about one to two times the direct exports, and private merchants' exports have not yet been calculated. Judging from Beiping City's need for grain and raw materials and its industrial production capacity, the achievements in this urban-rural material exchange are significant.
    How were these achievements obtained? What good working methods and experiences have been created in developing urban-rural trade?
    With the liberation of Beiping, the People's Government and state trade departments transported large quantities of daily necessities such as grain, edible oil, salt, and coal, ensuring that Beiping City, which had been sucked dry by the reactionaries, obtained sufficient supplies. Then, as time went on, the business of the Trading Company gradually developed. Now, under the leadership of the Municipal Trading Company, specialized branches such as grain, cotton yarn and cloth, general merchandise, and mountain products have been established, as well as forty business offices and retail stores. The Trading Company has become an indispensable supporter and supplier in the lives of Beiping's two million citizens. Another sign of the Trading Company's business development is the evolution from simple supply and sales to direct assistance to production. By the end of June, the industries assisted by the Trading Company through methods such as "raw materials in exchange for finished products," "processing," "ordering finished products," and "consignment sales" included dyeing and weaving, knitting, flour, soap, vermicelli, cigarettes, and other industries, involving over 1,200 factories. The output of these assisted industries has generally increased, and the quality of many products has also improved significantly. This guarantees and promotes the material conditions for urban-rural trade. For example, recently, provinces such as Inner Mongolia, Liaoxi, and Jilin exchanged large quantities of grain, timber, and wool for daily necessities such as cloth, towels, socks, and toothbrushes from Beiping. Due to the development of production, these goods were immediately allocated in full, ensuring the smooth completion of the first large-scale trade between the two regions and enabling continued exchanges.
    As a link connecting the state-owned economy with the individual economy and as a strong assistant to the state-owned economy, cooperatives have also made great contributions to urban-rural trade in Beiping City. In order to connect urban and rural relations, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative specifically established a warehousing department and a farmers' reception center. Through methods such as agency sales, introduction of transactions, and purchase and wholesale, it has established direct business relationships with cooperatives in Shandong, Jinan, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and other provinces and cities, as well as many provinces, cities, and counties in the North China region. In June alone, the flour transported from various places amounted to 7,070 bags, rice to 57,310 jin, wheat to 46,900 jin, millet and miscellaneous grains to 237,020 jin, raw silk to 427.5 jin, and reed mats to 6,245 rolls. In June, 1,232 farmers from rural areas came to the city to directly sell agricultural products and purchase daily necessities, staying at the reception center. The center helped them sell grain, mountain products, and pig bristles worth 19,759,049 yuan and purchase more than 20 kinds of daily necessities such as cloth, kerosene, agricultural tools, and coal worth 10,196,250 yuan.
    The Industrial Exhibition jointly held by the industrial circles of Beiping City in June played a huge and direct role in promoting urban-rural material exchange. More than 150,000 people visited the exhibition; people's governments and industrial and commercial circles from various regions of North China, major cities, and more than a dozen regions such as Shandong, Northeast, and Northwest sent delegations to visit. During the exhibition, visitors put forward many opinions and requests, and the industrial circles held several discussions with delegations from various places, allowing the regions to understand the industrial production capacity and situation of Beiping City, and allowing the industrial circles of Beiping to begin to understand the production and needs of various places. This found a way for Beiping's industrial production to meet the needs of various places, laying the foundation for material exchange between various regions and between urban and rural areas. It provided more basis for the planning of Beiping City and various places in the future, and strengthened the possibility of large-scale trade between Beiping City and the vast countryside, and between various regions.
    Most importantly, the correct trade policies and strong leadership of the People's Government. The People's Government of Beiping City established a Trade Guidance Office, specifically responsible for matters related to urban-rural trade and material exchange between regions. In June, the Trade Guidance Office, the Beiping City Trading Company, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and other organizations jointly organized two trade groups, one to the Northeast and one to the PingSui Railway line, to discuss trade issues between the two regions. Other measures, such as providing as much convenience as possible to manufacturers who go to the interior to purchase raw materials and grain and promote finished products, and the government issuing purchase and sales permits to facilitate connection with the people's governments and trade cooperation departments in the production and sales areas and obtain assistance; and state banks issuing production loans and cooperative loans, all played a direct and indirect role in promoting and facilitating urban-rural material exchange. (⑴⑵)
    In this way, thanks to the pioneering efforts of the state-owned trading company, the cooperation of cooperatives, and the promotion, support, and guidance of the People's Government, urban-rural trade in Beiping City is becoming increasingly prosperous. However, what the people hope for is a closer urban-rural relationship, more effective urban-rural mutual assistance, and more prosperous urban-rural trade than at present. In order to achieve the above goals, according to the reporter's understanding, the following issues should be further resolved.
    The constant prosperity of urban-rural trade is based on investigation and research and the development of production. If what is produced in the city is not what the countryside needs, it will not be possible to maintain a normal, lasting, and increasingly prosperous urban-rural trade relationship. Some time ago, the trading company vigorously supported the knitting industry, but because the countryside did not need it, the finished products could not be sold. This was mainly the result of a lack of investigation and research, which not only directly affected the normal development of the knitting industry, but also inevitably affected urban-rural trade. Beiping City has accepted this lesson and is taking various methods mentioned above to understand the situation. These are all good and should be strengthened. Only by strengthening investigation and research can we know what each other has and does not have, strengthen the planning of production, and carry out urban-rural trade in a step-by-step and planned manner to meet the needs of urban and rural areas and achieve the goal of urban-rural mutual assistance. This is one. Secondly, urban-rural trade is a very large undertaking, and it can only be done well with the strong support and leadership of the state-owned trade department and the active participation of a large number of merchants. At the beginning of July, when mobilizing merchants to purchase wheat in wheat-producing areas, many merchants showed indifference and waited and watched. In addition to reasons such as rising prices in the producing areas, some shortcomings in the operation of the Trading Company were also one of the reasons. In the operation of certain businesses, there used to be a paternalistic style, failing to guide and direct merchants to develop in directions that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, while at the same time restricting and preventing them from engaging in speculation and manipulation; instead of concentrating the main force on large-scale urban-rural material exchange, planned assistance to production, and price control, they to some extent dispersed their energy, trying to save producers and consumers from "intermediate exploitation" as much as possible. This starting point is good, but it is impossible under the current conditions. This is because some comrades who run state-owned businesses, although they understand the relationship between the state-owned economy and the private economy, lack specific experience in leading the private economy in actual work, especially in concentrated large cities, due to the lack of clear boundaries between "legitimate merchants" and "speculative merchants," and between "legitimate profits" and "excessive intermediate exploitation." Therefore, in some operations of the state-owned trade department, there is fear of large-scale commercial activities, unwillingness for merchants to profit, and an untimely attempt to make the masses suffer less or no intermediate exploitation, so they adopted a comprehensive and even "dividing troops to defend" operating method. The result will inevitably be dispersed forces. If a certain link is slightly neglected, speculative activities will take advantage of the opportunity, and even more seriously, this approach will undoubtedly hinder the enthusiasm of merchants and hinder the development of urban-rural trade. Third, the issue of soundly establishing and developing urban cooperatives is closely related to the above issues. Only when factory worker cooperatives and street cooperatives are universally developed can the state-owned trading company withdraw from the market operation of directly supplying citizens, concentrate its efforts on large-scale urban-rural trade, systematically assist production, and strengthen market research and leadership. Fourth, although Beiping City, which has been liberated for more than five months, has established trade relations with various parts of North China and neighboring regions, and has conducted many large-scale transactions, on careful reflection, this urban-rural trade is still abnormal, mainly manifested in the lack of fixed sources of raw materials and grain, the lack of fixed sales markets for Beiping's industrial products, the lack of regular customers for private enterprises, and the inability to thrive regularly; the lack of fixed sources and markets for urban-rural trade also prevents regular prosperity. Of course, the urban-rural relationship, which has been disrupted by long-term war, cannot be fixed all at once at the beginning of construction, but timely attention to this issue and efforts to address it will benefit the development of urban-rural trade. The key is that the city's own industrial products are needed by the rural masses, and are of good quality and low price, and that fair and reasonable prices are given when purchasing grain and raw materials from the countryside.
    To repeat, urban-rural trade can only establish a normal urban-rural trade with investigation and research as a prerequisite, development of production as a foundation, state-owned economy as leadership, strong cooperation of cooperatives, wide participation of merchants, and on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit.

　　北平市的城乡贸易
    本报记者  田流
    “城乡互助”是我们解放区新的城乡关系的主要特点，在经济上的互助，是通过城乡贸易来具体实现的。
    五个月来，北平市与华北许多中小城市和广大乡村，与东北、西北、内蒙、华东等友邻区的贸易是迅速发展，蒸蒸日上的。据极不完整的统计，仅市贸易公司即运来粮食一亿六千余万斤，食盐三百六十余万斤，食油四十余万斤，烟叶十九万斤，毛绒四万斤。如果连市贸易公司在市场上的购入计算在内，数量将远超过此数；私商运销量从全市的消费量估计，约当此数的两倍。同一时期贸易公司输往乡村的工业品，有棉布二万七千余匹，纱线三千二百余捆，袜子四千六百余打，毛巾一万九千余打，火柴一千四百余箱，碱末八万余斤，其他尚有背心、纸烟、粉丝等日用品甚多，这些物品，贸易公司在市场的销售量，约当直接输出的一倍至两倍，私商的输出尚未计算在内，从北平市粮食原料的需要和工业生产能力来看，这种城乡物资交流的成绩是巨大的。
    这些成绩是怎样得来的呢？在发展城乡贸易上，创造了那些好的工作方法和经验呢？
    随着北平解放，人民政府和国家贸易部门就运入了大量的粮食、食油、盐、煤等生活必需品，保证了被反动派吸吮得枯干了的北平市获得足够的供应。而后，随着时间的推移，贸易公司的业务也逐渐发展起来，如今在市贸易公司领导之下，已建立了粮食、花纱布、百货、山货等专业分支公司，及四十个营业处和零售店，贸易公司已经成为北平二百万市民生活中不可或缺的支持者与供应者了。贸易公司业务发展的另一标帜，是由单纯的供销业务发展到直接扶助生产，到六月底统计，由贸易公司“以原料换成品”、“加工”、“订购成品”、“受托代销”等方式扶助的工业，已有染织、针织、面粉、肥皂、粉丝、纸烟等多种工业千二百余工厂，这些被扶助了的工业，产量普遍增多，不少产品的质量也有显著的改进，这就保证促进了城乡贸易的物质条件，如最近内蒙、辽西、吉林等省区，以大批的粮食、木材、毛绒换取北平的条布、毛巾、袜子、牙刷等日用品，由于生产的发展，立即如数拨予，使两区首次的大量贸易顺利完成，并将继续进行交换。
    作为国营经济连系个体经济的纽带、国营经济有力助手的合作社，在北平市的城乡贸易上也有很大的贡献。市供销总社为着沟通城乡关系，特别设立了栈务部和农民招待所，以代销代售、介绍成交和收购批发等方法已同山东、济南、吉林、黑龙江等省市合作社及华北区内许多省、市、县合作社，建立了直接的业务关系，仅六月份经各地运来之面粉即有七、○七○袋，大米五七、三一○斤，麦子四六、九○○斤，小米杂粮二三七、○二○斤，生丝四二七·五斤，苇席六、二四五领。乡村来市直接售卖农产品和购买日用品的农民，六月份内有一、二三二人来招待所住宿，并代为推销了价值一九、七五九、○四九元之粮食、山货、猪鬃等，代购了价值一○、一九六、二五○元之布匹、煤油、农具、煤炭等二十余种日用品。
    六月间，平市工业界联合举行的工业展览会，对城乡物资交流起了巨大的直接的推动作用，参观者达十五万余人；华北各区、各大中城市及山东、东北、西北等十数个地区的人民政府，工商业界，都先后派代表团前来参观。在展览期间，观众们提出了许多意见与要求，工业界并曾多次的同各地代表团座谈，使各地区了解了北平市的工业生产的能力和情况，北平工业界也开始了解各地生产及需要情形，这就找到了北平工业生产如何适合各地需要的道路，打下了各区、城乡物资交流的基础。给今后北平市及各地工业生产的计划性增多了根据，加强了北平市与广大乡村之间，与各地区之间进行大批贸易的可能性。
    最重要的还是人民政府正确的贸易政策与坚强的领导。北平市人民政府建立了贸易指导处，专门负责有关城乡贸易和区域之间的物资交流事宜。六月间贸易指导处、北平市贸易公司、市供销总社等联合组织了两个贸易小组，一赴东北、一赴平绥沿线，商怡两区贸易问题。其他如尽量给前往内地采购原料粮食、推销成品的厂商以便利，政府发给购销证，以便与产销地之人民政府、贸易合作部门连系并获得帮助；国家银行发放生产贷款及合作贷款，都在城乡物资交流之沟通与畅旺上，起着直接间接的推动和促进作用。（⑴⑵）
    就是这样，由于国家贸易公司的领头开拓，合作社的配合，人民政府的提倡扶助和指导，北平市的城乡贸易就日益畅旺起来了。但人民所希望的是比现在更密切的城乡关系，更有效的城乡互助，更畅旺的城乡贸易，为着达到上述目的，据记者了解，有下面的几个问题是应该获得进一步解决的。
    城乡贸易的经常畅旺是以调查研究工作为前提，发展生产为基础的，如果城市里所生产的不是乡村所需要的，是不能维持正常持久日益畅旺的城乡贸易关系的。前些日子贸易公司大力扶植的针织业，由于乡村不需要，成品销不出去，这主要是缺乏调查研究的结果，不但直接影响针织业的正常发展，也必然会影响城乡贸易的。北平市已接受了这个教训，采取上述各种方法了解情况，这些都是很好的应该加强，只有加强调查研究工作，才能互知有无，加强生产的计划性，才能有步骤、有计划适合城乡需要的进行城乡贸行，达到城乡互助的目的。这是一。其次，城乡贸易是一件非常巨大的工作，只有国营贸易部门大力扶助领导和广大商人的积极参加才能作好。七月，发动商人赴产麦区购麦之初，不少商人表现冷淡和观望，除产地涨价等原因外，贸易公司在经营上有某些缺点也是原因之一。在某种业务的经营上，曾存在过包办作风，没有领导指导商人向有利国民生计方面发展，而又管制限止他投机操纵；不完全是集中主要力量进行大规模的城乡物资交流、有计划的扶助生产和掌握物价，而是一定程度的分散精力，面面俱到，想把生产者与消费者尽可能的从“中间剥削”中拯救出来，这种出发点是好的，但目前条件下是不可能的，这是由于有些办国家商业的同志，虽然了解国营经济对私营经济的关系，但却缺乏在实际的工作中特别是在集中的大城市中领导私营经济的具体经验，由于对“正当商人”与“投机商人”，“正当利润”与“过高中间剥削”等缺乏明确的分界所致。因此，在国营贸易部门的某些经营中，个别同志的思想中，存在着害怕大规模的商业活动，不愿商人得利，而超时的想使群众少受或不受中间剥削，于是采取了面面俱到甚至“分兵把守”的经营方法，结果必然会产生力量分散。某一环节稍有疏忽，投机活动便会乘隙而起，而更严重的是这种作法，无疑的会妨碍商人的积极性，妨碍城乡贸易的展开的。第三，和上述问题有密切联系的健全与发展城市合作社问题，只有工厂中职工合作社和街道合作社普遍的发展起来，才可能使国家贸易公司从直接供应市民的市场经营中抽出身来，集中力量进行大规模的城乡贸易，有步骤的扶助生产，和加强对市场的调查研究与领导。第四，解放五个多月的北平市，虽然已和华北各地及友邻区建立了贸易关系，也进行过多次的大规模的交易，但仔细回想一下，这种城乡贸易还是不正常的，主要表现在原料和粮食没有固定的来源，北平市的工业品也没有固定的销售市场，私人企业没有经常的主顾，不能经常兴隆；城乡贸易没有固定的来源与市场，也不能经常畅旺；自然，被长期战争打乱了的城乡关系，在初建时不能一下子搞好，但及时的对此问题加以注意和努力，对城乡贸易的开展上是有益的。其关键是城市本身的工业品是农村群众所需要的，又是物美价廉的，而收购农村的粮食和原料时，又给予公道合理的价格。
    重复一句，城乡贸易是以调查研究为前提，发展生产为基础，国营经济为领导，合作社有力配合，有广泛的商人参加，在互助两利的原则下，才能建立起正常的城乡贸易。
