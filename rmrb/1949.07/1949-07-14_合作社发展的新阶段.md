　　New Stage of Cooperative Development
    Wang Gengjin
    The development of cooperatives in the liberated areas has a history of nearly ten years, and it has entered a new stage of development since last winter and this spring.

    In the past, the liberated areas were under the division and blockade of Japanese invaders and puppet and diehard forces. At that time, the basic economic task was: to ensure military and civilian needs and achieve self-sufficiency. Therefore, cooperatives at that time did not pay much attention to supply and marketing businesses, but only emphasized organizing production (the so-called production cooperatives that organized handicraft production at that time were actually mostly small-scale supply and marketing cooperatives built on the basis of household handicrafts). It played a great role in organizing and supporting the sideline and handicraft production of the masses, and made indelible contributions to ensuring self-sufficiency in military and civilian needs.

    However, the current situation is different from the past. The current liberated areas are no longer divided and blockaded by the enemy, but are vast liberated areas connected as one, with cities and modern transportation. Therefore, today's economic requirements are no longer self-sufficiency, but urban-rural division of labor (industrial and agricultural division of labor), regional division of labor, and each utilizing its own unique and superior conditions for production. Therefore, the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, as well as the exchange of goods between regions, has become the primary issue to be resolved in the current development of production. The current cooperatives should, according to this new environmental requirement, change the past regional self-sufficiency policy, develop supply, marketing, and consumer businesses, supply the masses with necessities for production and life, promote the sale of agricultural and handicraft products of the masses, eliminate speculation, reduce exploitation, and vigorously support the development of production undertakings.

    Since last winter and this spring, the cooperatives in the liberated areas have been developed in accordance with this new requirement and have adopted new management methods:

    First, equal shares, no dividends: The new type of supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives are clearly aimed at serving the members, not at profit-making and dividend distribution. The benefits enjoyed by the members are to purchase cheap necessities and sell their products at fair prices. Because the rights of the members are the same, the amount of shares should also be equal. "Buying cheap things is equivalent to dividends" (the reaction of Jinan workers), and there is no need to stimulate shareholding with dividends. The implementation of this new method has effectively overcome the purely profit-making management of some cooperatives in the past, and turned to serving the members. The benefits given to the members in this way are much greater than the benefits obtained from dividends based on shares in the past. For example, in the past, the cooperatives in various places, even if each yuan could distribute two yuan per period (half a year), still could not keep up with the high prices and were still losing money; recently, the consumer cooperatives in Beiping supplied members with grain at low prices. "According to calculations by many members: grain is two yuan cheaper per catty than the market price, and if each person eats one catty of grain per day, then a family of five can save ten yuan, and three hundred yuan a month. They said: We have to calculate the days in the long term, and we can earn back the share capital in a few days!" (See Beiping Liberation Daily, April 28). The Taiyue District Cooperative collected the native cloth produced by the masses and sold it in the Northwest, exchanged it for livestock, and sold it to the members at a low price, which was even more profitable.

    Second, do not do business with non-members: The new cooperative's buying and selling business is to solve the difficulties for the members, and it is by no means to pursue profits in the market. Clearly stipulating that no business should be done with non-members is of great significance for correcting the purely profit-making erroneous management methods of some cooperatives in the past. At the same time, because non-members cannot get the benefits of the cooperative, it can further stimulate the masses to join the cooperative and expand the organization of the cooperative. Only the cooperation of the broad masses can enable the production and distribution of various products to be subject to national statistics and supervision, and gradually move towards a planned economy. For example, the Jiaodong Jingbiao District Cooperative first registers the quantity of goods needed by the members before buying goods, buys according to the quantity, and distributes according to the registration, completely overcoming the blindness in supply.

    Third, establish organizational leadership: In the past, each village or street cooperative was a business unit. Due to the lack of leadership from the higher-level cooperatives, the activities of the village or street cooperatives formed a blind competition for profits among the cooperatives. The new cooperatives have paid attention to the establishment of higher-level cooperatives (general cooperatives or promotion cooperatives) from the beginning, and unified the activities of the primary-level cooperatives through the higher-level cooperatives. The general cooperative in the same area is an independent business unit. The primary-level cooperative is only a component of the regional general cooperative, not a business unit. The goods it supplies and sells are uniformly purchased or sold remotely by the regional general cooperative, and the prices are uniformly stipulated by the general cooperative, and the primary-level cooperative cannot change them at will. Therefore, the new cooperatives do not have blind competition among themselves, and their supply and marketing behavior is an organized and planned commercial behavior.

    Fourth, strengthen the combination of urban and rural areas: In the past, the exchange relationship between urban and rural areas was cut off by the enemy. Today, restoring the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas is an extremely important issue in the development of production. The new cooperatives have already begun to pay attention to this work. There are no transportation offices or stations in the cities of Shandong. There are farmer reception centers or service centers in North China, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and other places. Some cooperatives in the cities of Northeast China have established branches or stations in rural areas, which have played a great role in connecting the exchange relationship between urban and rural areas. At the same time, they reduced the handling fees for buying and selling on behalf of others (ordinary freight yards charge 3% of the handling fee, they only charge 1%, or do not charge), directly established contact with factories, supplied cities with grain and industrial raw materials (such as cotton, wood, waste cloth, etc.), and transported urban industrial products such as matches, paper, yarn, cloth, etc. to the countryside to supply farmers, eliminating the middleman exploitation of merchants from these main materials.

    Fifth, closely link the cooperative with the state-owned economic departments: The cooperatives in the liberated areas have been developing and growing under the support and help of the democratic government, especially the state-owned economic departments, from the beginning. However, in the past, it was often not regular and sometimes some uncoordinated contradictions occurred. Since last winter and this spring, the relationship between the cooperative and the state-owned economic departments has been further strengthened. The state-owned economic departments have further given strong support to the cooperative, and the cooperative has also helped the state-owned economic departments to complete many arduous economic tasks, which is reflected in: (1) The funds of the senior cooperatives (general cooperatives or promotion cooperatives) are all loaned by the state banks, and overdraft relationships have been established. Some primary cooperatives have also received loan support from the state banks; (2) The trade departments supply the cooperative with grain and other necessities at low prices. For example, the Tianjin Trading Company gives the cooperative a preferential treatment of 5% to 10% for grain supply. In addition, the enterprise departments, in addition to giving the cooperative a discount, can also take the goods first and pay later, which is the most powerful support for the cooperative; (3) The trade company purchases and sells goods through the cooperative, which has played a great role in stabilizing prices, such as the trade departments in the Northeast purchasing grain through rural cooperatives, and supplying oil, salt, cloth, agricultural tools and other necessities to the cooperative, greatly eliminating the middleman exploitation of merchants; (4) The cooperative helps the national economic departments to purchase goods, such as the Northeast purchasing grain and sleepers through the cooperative, and the Shandong cooperative contracting to make military shoes (completing 4 million pairs of military shoes in two months), which not only saves the public money and manpower waste, but also ensures the timely completion of the urgent tasks to support the front. The cooperative has become a powerful assistant to the state-owned economic departments, and the state-owned economic departments are the leader and backer of the cooperative.

    These are the several important characteristics of the current new type of cooperative, or the new direction of the current development of cooperatives in the liberated areas. Of course, the new stage of the cooperative has only just begun, and there are still many problems and obstacles on the road ahead, but under the leadership and support of the democratic government, under the supervision of the broad masses, and under the efforts of the cooperative workers, the problems and obstacles will definitely be solved and overcome satisfactorily in the near future.

### 合作社发展的新阶段

　　合作社发展的新阶段
    王耕今
    解放区合作社的发展已有将近十年的历史，从去冬今春开始了它发展的新阶段。
    过去解放区是在日寇和伪顽分割封锁下，那时经济上的基本任务是：保证军需民用求得自给自足。所以，当时的合作社，并不重视供销业务，而只强调组织生产（当时组织手工业生产的所谓生产合作社实际大多亦是建筑在家庭手工业基础上的小型的供销合作社），它在组织扶持群众的副业和手工业生产上，起了很大的作用，在保证军需民用的自给自足上，也有其不可磨灭的贡献。
    但是现在的情况和以前不同了，现在的解放区再不是被敌人分割封锁的局面，而是广大解放区联成一片，有了城市和近代化的交通，因此今天在经济上的要求，已不再是自给自足，而应是城乡分工（工业和农业分工）地区分工，各利用自己特有的优越的条件来进行生产。因而城乡间的物资交换，以及地区之间的物资交换，便成为目前发展生产中，首先要解决的问题。目前的合作社，应该根据这个新的环境要求，转变过去地区性的自给自足的方针，发展供销和消费业务，供给群众生产和生活上的必需品，推销群众的农业和手工业生产品，排除投机，减免剥削，以有力地扶持生产事业的发展。
    去冬今春以来，解放区的合作社，都是按照这个新的要求发展的，并且采取了新的经营方法：
    第一、平均入股，不分红利：新型的供销社和消费社，是明确的以为社员服务为目的的，而不是以营利分红为目的的。社员所享受的利益，就是购买廉价的必需品，和以公道的价钱推销生产品。因为社员的权利是一样的，所以股金额也应该是平均的。“购买便宜东西，就等于分红”（济南工人的反映）用不着再以分红来刺激入股。由于这一新方法的实行，就有效地克服了过去某些合作社单纯营利的经营，而转向为社员服务。这样所给予社员的利益就比过去按股分红所得利益大的多。如过去各地的合作社，即使每元每期（半年）可分红两元，但远跟不上物价的高涨，算起来仍是蚀本；最近北平的消费社廉价供给社员粮食，“据许多社员计算：粮食每斤比市价便宜二元，按每人每天吃一斤粮，那么五口之家，就可以省十元，一个月就省三百元。他们说：日子要往长算哪，几天就把股金赚回来了！”（见四月二十八日北平解放报）太岳区合作社把群众生产的土布收起来，到西北去出卖，换回牲口，廉价卖给社员，得利更大。
    第二、不做非社员的生意：新的合作社的买卖经营，是为给社员解决困难的，绝不是为了在市场上追逐利润。明确规定不做非社员的生意，对纠正过去某些合作社的单纯营利的错误经营方法，是有巨大意义的。同时，因为非社员得不到合作社的好处，更可刺激群众入社，扩大合作社的组织。惟有广大群众的合作化，才能使各种产品之生产与分配，实行国家的统计和监督，逐渐走向计划经济。如胶东旌表区合作社，在买货之前，先登记社员的需品数量，按数购买，照登记分配，完全克服了供给上的盲目性。
    第三、建立组织领导：过去每一个村社或街社，就是一个经营单位，由于缺乏上级社的领导，村社或街社的活动，形成各社之间的盲目的竞争利润现象。新的合作社，一开始就注意了上级社（总社或推进社）的建立，通过上级社把基层社的活动统一起来，在同一地区内的总社，才是一个独立的经营单位。基层社只是地区总社的一个组成部分，而不是一个经营单位，它所供销的物品，是由地区总社负责统一采购或远地推销，物价由总社统一规定，基层社不能随意变更。所以新的合作社没有相互之间的盲目的竞争，他们的供销行为是一种有组织有计划的商业行为。
    第四、加强城乡结合：过去城乡交换关系被敌人割断了，今天恢复城乡间的物资交流，是发展生产中异常重要的问题。新的合作社，已经开始注意了这一工作，在山东的城市中都没有运销处或运销站，华北平津石等处有农民招待所或服务所，东北城市的合作社有的在农村成立分社或站，对于沟通城乡的交换关系起了很大的作用。同时它们降低了代买代卖的手续费（普通货栈抽手续费百分之三，它们仅抽百分之一，或不抽），直接和工厂建立联系，供给城市粮食和工业原料（如棉花、木材、破布等），并把城市的工业品如火柴、纸张、纱、布等运到农村供给农民，从这些主要的物资上免除了商人的中间剥削。
    第五、密切合作社与国营经济部门的联系：解放区的合作社，一开始便是在民主政府特别是在国营经济部门扶持帮助之下，发展和壮大起来的。不过过去往往表现得不经常不正轨，而且还有时发生一些不协调的矛盾现象。自去冬今春以来，合作社和国营经济部门的关系是进一步的密切了，国营经济部门进一步地给予合作社以有力的扶持，合作社也帮助国营经济部门完成了不少的艰巨的经济任务，这表现在：（一）高级社（总社或推进社）的资金，都是国家银行贷给的，并且建立了透支关系，基层社也有的得到国家银行的贷款扶持；（二）贸易部门廉价的供给合作社粮食及其他必需品，如平津贸易公司供给合作社粮食给予百分之五至百分之十的优待。另外还有企业部门除给合作社以折扣的优待外，并可先取货后付款，这是给合作社最有力的支持；（三）贸易公司通过合作社收购和抛售物资，对平仰物价起了很大的作用，如东北的贸易部门通过农村合作社收购粮食，并供给油盐布农具等必需品给合作社，大大免除了商人的中间剥削；（四）合作社帮助国家经济部门收购物资，如东北通过合作社收购粮食和枕木，山东合作社包做军鞋（两个月完成军鞋四百万双），不仅替公家节省了钱和人力的浪费，而且保证按时完成了紧迫的支前任务。合作社已成为国营经济部门的有力的助手，国营经济部门则是合作社的领导者和靠山。
    这就是目前新型合作社的几个重要特点，或者说是目前解放区合作社发展的新方向。当然，合作社新阶段开始的时间还很短，在前进的路上还有不少的问题和障碍，但在民主政府的领导和扶持下，在广大群众的监督下和在合作工作者努力下，问题和障碍在不久的将来是一定会得到圆满的解决和克服的。
