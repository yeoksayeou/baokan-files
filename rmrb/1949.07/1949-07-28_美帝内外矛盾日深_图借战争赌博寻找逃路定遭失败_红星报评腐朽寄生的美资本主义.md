Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 27th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The Red Star newspaper published a lengthy article by Vitali Korionov, entitled "America - A Decadent and Parasitic Capitalist Country." The author lists facts to show that the economy, domestic politics, diplomacy, culture, art, and all aspects of American life today are marked with the imprint of imperialist reaction and oppression. No capitalist country's monopoly trusts, banks, and financial oligarchs have as frightening an influence as in the United States. The largest American monopoly capital dominates the control of the major sectors of the American economy. It is enough to point out that the national aluminum industry is controlled by the Mellon Trust alone; Morgan controls 444 companies, with a capital of 77 billion yuan, nearly twice the annual income of Britain and Ireland. Such a large concentration of wealth in the hands of a handful of industrialists and financiers is the most prominent manifestation of the parasitic nature of U.S. imperialism.

The author emphasizes: The small group of financial and industrial giants in the United States not only enslaves and plunders the American people, but they also directly and indirectly rule hundreds of millions of people in Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world. American monopoly capital is like a huge vampire, sucking the blood of hundreds of millions of people in every corner of the earth.

Accelerated Labor Under U.S. Capitalism
 Workers Become Useless After Five Years of Work, Mortality Rate Ranks First in the World

The author analyzes the accelerated labor system in American factories, which cruelly drains the energy of workers. The exploitation of workers in American automobile factories has reached such a degree that workers are completely useless after five years of work. Working conditions in the United States after the war are even worse. In 1947 alone, approximately 65,000 workers died in accidents or became severely disabled in U.S. coal mines. Workers labor under difficult and dangerous working conditions, while the wages they receive are only enough to live a semi-starved life. Accidents, illnesses, and mortality rates rank first in the world. Even according to U.S. official figures, there are 25 million people in the United States who are constantly ill. The health status of children can be seen from the following figures: 200,000 children suffer from epilepsy, 175,000 suffer from tuberculosis, and 4 million have poor eyesight. This is the actual situation of the infamous "American way of life" that plunges millions of people into starvation, disease, and death.

When discussing the political freedoms of the American people, the author writes: The so-called democracy that dominates the United States is only to obtain unlimited power for monopoly capital and to legitimize the lack of rights of the working people. The masses of the American people are virtually deprived of political rights. Praising the American race as "superior" to other nations is one of the main means of cultivating an anti-democratic order at home. One of the main "ideological" smokescreens of the imperialist aggressors - the notorious "living space" theory, has found its paradise in the soil of American monopoly capitalism and is redeveloping and growing. Korionov points out: U.S. foreign policy serves these goals. This foreign policy is the source that has almost exhausted the internal forces for continued progress. The huge plan to enslave the world, concocted by the U.S. imperialists, is the product of the most reactionary and decadent monopoly capital. This capital is attempting to find a way out of the growing internal and external contradictions through war gambling. The author concludes: However, the strength of the forces defending peace and democracy is immeasurable, and this strength now exceeds the strength of imperialism. At the forefront of this force is the great Soviet Union - a powerful and invincible vanguard of universal peace and democracy and national independence. It is confident in thwarting all the plots of the warmongers and consolidating peace.

　　美帝内外矛盾日深
  　图借战争赌博寻找逃路定遭失败
    红星报评腐朽寄生的美资本主义
    【新华社北平二十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红星报发表维塔里·柯利昂诺夫的长篇论文，题为“美国——腐朽而寄生的资本主义国度”。作者列举事实说明美国的经济、内政、外交、文化、艺术以及今日美国生活的各个方面，都刻上了帝国主义反动压迫的印记。没有任何一个资本主义国家的垄断托拉斯、银行和金融寡头的神通广大到美国这样可怕的程度。最大的美国垄断资本独霸着美国经济各主要部门的控制权。只消指出这一点就够了：全国的铝工业都是由梅隆托拉斯一家所控制；摩根控制着四百四十四家公司，拥有资本七百七十亿元，几近英国与爱尔兰一年收入的两倍。财富这样大量集中在屈指可数的几个工业家和金融家的手里，这就是美帝国主义寄生性的最突出的表现。
    作者强调指出：美国一小撮金融与工业巨头集团不仅仅奴役与掠夺美国人民，他们还直接间接地统治着欧洲、亚洲和世界其他地方数以万万计的人民。美国垄断资本象一个巨大的吸血鬼，吮吸着地球上各个角落里成亿人民的血液。
    加快制下的美国工人
  　工作五年即成废人死亡率居世界第一
    作者分析美国工厂残酷地榨尽工人精力的加快制。美国汽车工厂工人受剥削到了这种程度，以至于工人在工作五年之后就完全成了废人。美国战后的工作条件更加恶劣。一九四七年仅在美国煤矿中就有工人六万五千左右死于意外或变成严重的残废。工人在艰难危险的工作条件下劳动，而所得的工资却只能过着半饥饿的生活。意外事件、疾病和死亡率位居世界第一。即使根据美国的官方数字，美国经常的病人就有二千五百万之多。儿童的健康状态可以从下面的数字看出来：二十万儿童患癫痫病，十七万五千患肺痨病，四百万视力不良。这就是使千百万人民陷于饥馑、疾病和死亡的臭名远扬的“美国生活方式”的实际情形。
    作者在论及美国人民的政治自由时写道：支配美国的所谓民主，只是为垄断资本取得权力无边的统治，并使劳动人民的毫无权利现象合法化。美国人民群众实际上被剥夺了政治权利。歌颂美国种族较其他民族“优秀”，是在国内培植反民主秩序的主要手段之一。帝国主义侵略者的主要“思想”烟幕之一——声名狼藉的“生存空间”论，在美国垄断资本主义的土壤上找到了它的乐园，又在再度发育滋长了。柯利昂诺夫指出：美国的外交政策是为这些目标服务的。这个外交政策是那个几乎耗尽了继续前进的内部力量的泉源。美帝国主义者所策划的奴役全世界的巨大计划，就是最反动的腐朽的垄断资本的产物。这个资本企图在战争赌博中寻找逃脱日益增长的内外矛盾的道路。作者结语称：但是，保卫和平民主的力量之大是不可衡量的，这个力量现在已经超过了帝国主义的力量。在这个力量的前头是伟大的苏联——普遍和平与民主和各民族独立的强大不可战胜的前卫。它有信心挫败战争贩子的一切图谋并巩固和平。
