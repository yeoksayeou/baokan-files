One Month in Rural Henan

Leading Production and Disaster Relief, Overcoming the Spring Famine, Uniting the Broad Masses of Peasants, Eliminating Bandits

The focus of work in rural Henan during May was to further develop disaster relief, bandit suppression, and political offensives against bandits. Leading organs in various counties earnestly led production and disaster relief work, enabling peasants throughout Henan Province, with the exception of some areas in the Yellow River flooded region, to basically overcome the spring famine. This united and mobilized the broad masses of peasants, gradually展开ing mass-based bandit suppression and political offensives against bandits, severely打击ing bandits and special agents in various regions, leading to the surrender of many bandits.

In March, the disaster situation in many areas of Henan was quite serious, but some cadres did not pay enough attention to production and disaster relief work. Special agents took advantage of secret societies, reactionary bullies, and other elements to carry out riots in areas such as Wanxi. In April, although various localities began to attach importance to leading production and disaster relief, suppressing bandits, and launching political offensives, the打击 inflicted on bandits and special agents was not significant, and most bandits and special agents scattered, concealed themselves, or fled to mountainous areas. Many cadres in some areas did not have a sufficient understanding of this and did not implement bandit suppression and political offensives before shifting to other tasks. As a result, bandits and special agents were able to continue to seek opportunities for sabotage and disruption.

At the end of April, after the CCP Central Committee's Central Plains Bureau issued important instructions on further开展ing disaster relief, bandit suppression, and political offensives, leading organs in various counties clearly recognized that disaster relief was an important link in isolating the enemy and展开ing mass-based bandit suppression and political offensives. Various counties deployed work according to this方針. More than ten counties in severely affected areas such as Nanyang and Luoyang carried out grain borrowing and mutual assistance movements in a leadership-led and orderly manner, resolving the spring famine difficulties of many poor peasants. However, in some areas, cadres did not correctly grasp the grain borrowing policy and infringed upon the interests of middle peasants, which caused dissatisfaction among middle peasants. However, this error was quickly corrected. In the Yellow River flooded area, county people's governments also continuously distributed 1.9 million catties of disaster relief grain and loans to help disaster victims rebuild their homes and restore production. They also used work-for-relief to organize disaster victims to dig rivers and repair embankments. Before the wheat harvest, counties such as Xihua, Luyi, Xiangcheng, and Huaiyang completed a huge water conservancy project of more than 700 li in length, saving more than 470,000 mu of farmland. This appropriately solved the livelihood difficulties of hundreds of thousands of disaster victims. By the time the wheat harvest began in late May, the spring famine had been largely overcome except in most of the Yellow River flooded area. For example, in the severely affected area of Xihua County, nearly 390,000 mu of wheat were also planted with the assistance of the people's government in lending cattle and seeds last autumn, and this summer each person harvested an average of 120 catties of wheat.

In addition, the Central Plains Trading Company purchased large quantities of cotton, tobacco, and homespun cloth at high prices through trading companies in Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Xuchang, and transported them to the liberated areas of North China, East China, and Northeast China,畅通ing the sales of local products. By mid-May, the major cities of Jiangnan had been successively liberated, and widespread rains had fallen in various places, and the enthusiasm of farmers for production was generally high. In Xuchang and other tobacco-producing areas, Kaifeng, Shangqiu and other peanut-producing areas, and Gongxian and other cotton-producing areas, the planting area of industrial crops was generally expanded with the assistance of loans and grain from the people's government. Chenliu Prefecture alone planted about 1.1 million mu of peanuts and 634,000 mu of cotton, 16 percent more than last year.

In production, cadres in some areas led peasants to organize mutual assistance, solving the difficulties of the lack of animal power and farm implements. Some villages also combined production with the consolidation of peasant association organizations, rewarding model cadres and peasant association members,清清ing landlords and old-style rich peasants who had混入ed into the peasant associations, further提高ing the class consciousness of the peasants, and扩 and巩固ing the peasant ranks.

In early May, scattered and concealed bandits and special agents took advantage of the period between the end of the spring crop and the beginning of the summer crop, as well as the gaps in some areas where disaster relief work had not been grasped tightly in the past, to spread rumors of抢 wheat, and launched抢 wheat riots in some areas. In order to protect the interests of the peasants, the Henan Provincial Government promulgated a proclamation to protect the wheat harvest and prohibit抢 wheat. The peasants in various places, due to the disaster relief and other work, gradually安定ed their emotions and organized themselves to斗争 with the bandits and special agents. Villages in Chenliu, Nanyang, Xuchang and other counties organized joint防,配合ing local armed forces to suppress bandits and保 wheat. The leading organs in Lanfeng, Tongxu and other counties corrected the past tendency of purely military清剿, organized armed work teams to深入 various villages to help the peasants锄地 and收 wheat, and at the same time conducted investigations and visits, convened meetings of bandit family members, mass meetings, etc. to争取 bandits to缴枪 and悔过. This work has been successful in all regions. According to statistics from Huangchuan, Shanzhou, Luoyang, Nanyang and other分区, more than 800 bandits were歼 in the second half of May; most of the bandit leaders in Gushi, Shangcheng, Guangshan and other places were arrested, and small groups of bandits纷纷缴枪 and投降. The Henan Provincial People's Government is now further发动ing the broad masses of people to continue清剿 work and political offensives, in order to彻底肃清 bandits散处 in various places.

### 河南农村一月　领导生产救灾渡过春荒团结广大农民肃清土匪

　　河南农村一月
  　领导生产救灾渡过春荒团结广大农民肃清土匪
    五月份的河南农村工作是以进一步开展救荒、剿匪和对土匪的政治攻势为中心来进行的。各县领导机关曾认真地领导了生产救灾工作，使得河南全省农民，除了一部分黄泛区以外，基本上渡过了春荒，从而团结与发动了广大农民，逐步地展开了群众性的剿匪和对土匪的政治攻势，给予各地土匪特务分子严重打击，许多土匪缴枪投降。
    三月间河南不少地区的灾情相当严重，但有些干部并没有重视生产救灾工作，特务分子则利用会门、反动恶霸等在宛西等地进行暴乱。四月，各地对领导生产救荒、剿匪和开展政治攻势虽已提起重视，但给予土匪特务分子的打击不大，匪特大部分散隐蔽或流窜山区。而不少地区的干部对此认识不足，未贯彻剿匪和进行政治攻势，即转入其他工作。因之，土匪特务分子得以继续寻机进行骚动破坏。
    四月底，中共中央中原局发出进一步开展救荒剿匪和政治攻势的重要指示以后，各县领导机关才明确地认识了救荒是孤立敌人，开展群众性的剿匪和政治攻势的重要环节。各县都根据这个方针布置了工作。南阳、洛阳等十余县重灾区，有领导有秩序地进行了借粮互济运动，解决了不少贫苦农民的春荒困难。但也有些地区干部没有正确掌握借粮政策，侵犯了中农的利益，曾引起中农的不满。但这种错误很快便得到纠正。在黄泛区，各县人民政府也连续发放赈粮贷粮一百九十万斤，扶助灾民重建家园，恢复生产；并以工代赈，组织灾民挖河修提。麦收前，西华、鹿邑、项城、淮阳等县完成了全长七百多里的巨大水利工程，救出了良田四十七万多亩。这样，就相适当解决了数十万灾民的生活困难。至五月下旬开始麦收，除大部黄泛区外，春荒即大体渡过。如西华县重灾区，去秋在人民政府贷牛贷种扶助下，亦种麦近三十九万亩，今夏每人平均收麦一百二十斤。
    此外，中原贸易总公司通过郑州、洛阳、许昌等地贸易公司大批高价收购棉花、烟叶、土布等，转输华北、华东、东北等解放区，畅通了土产品的销路。至五月中，江南各大城市相继解放，各地又普降透雨，农民生产情绪普遍高涨。许昌等产烟区，开封、商邱等产花生地区和巩县等产棉区，在人民政府贷款贷粮扶助下，工业作物种植面积普遍扩大。仅陈留专区即种花生约一百一十万亩，种棉花六十三万四千余亩，较去年多种百分之十六。
    在生产中，部分地区干部领导了农民组织互助，解决了畜力、农具缺乏的困难。部分村庄并与生产结合整顿了农会组织，奖励了模范干部和农会会员，清除了混入农会的地主和旧式富农，进一步提高了农民的阶级觉悟，扩大和巩固了农民队伍。
    五月上旬，分散隐蔽和流窜的土匪特务分子曾利用青黄不接时机及部分地区过去未抓紧救荒工作的空隙，散播抢麦谣言，并在某些地区发动抢麦骚动。河南省政府为保障农民利益，乃颁布了保卫麦收禁止抢麦的布告。各地农民，由于经过了救灾等工作，情绪逐渐安定，便纷纷组织起来与土匪特务分子进行斗争。陈留、南阳、许昌等县各村并组织联防，配合地方武装剿匪保麦。兰封、通许等县领导机关则纠正了过去单纯的军事清剿偏向，组织武装工作组深入各村帮助农民锄地收麦，同时进行调查访问，召集土匪家属会、群众会等争取土匪缴枪悔过。这一工作各地均获成绩。据潢川、陕州、洛阳、南阳等分区统计，五月下半月共歼匪八百余名；固始、商城、光山等地匪首大部被捕，小股土匪纷纷缴枪投降。现河南人民政府正进一步发动广大人民继续进行清剿工作和政治攻势，以彻底肃清散处各地的土匪。
