　　All-China Musicians Association
　　Sends Respects to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
　　Replies to Soviet Composers and Music Workers, Pledging Joint Struggle for World Lasting Peace
　　Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
　　The All-China Musicians Association has been established today after days of preparation. From now on, we not only have the principle you have indicated of literature and art serving the people, and serving the workers, peasants and soldiers first, but also have an organization to ensure the implementation of this principle.
　　In the past, under the guidance of your great thought, we have done some work in mass singing movements and the creation of new operas, but compared with the development of the revolutionary situation and the needs of the people, our past achievements are still very small, and today's tasks are even greater. We will faithfully follow the path you have indicated, using the weapon of music to fight tirelessly for the People's Democratic Republic, and believe that the new people's music cause will inevitably move from victory to victory! We extend our highest respects! And wish you eternal health!

　　To the Soviet Composers Association, forwarded to all Soviet composers and music workers:
　　We were infinitely excited to read your congratulatory message to the All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers! And sincerely thank you for your concern and encouragement for our conference.
　　Now the conference has victoriously concluded under the guidance of our wise people's leader Chairman Mao's correct policy of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and established the highest leading organ of all-China literary and art workers, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, led by Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and Zhou Yang. And the leading organs of various departments have been established separately, with the All-China Musicians Association established in the music field.
　　We infinitely and loyally support and participate in the world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, striving for the complete victory of lasting peace and people's democracy, and especially hope to strengthen the cultural and artistic exchange between China and the Soviet Union and the people of all countries in the future.
　　The rich Russian classical music and the great socialist music have given Chinese music workers infinite inspiration and profound education for more than a decade, and have been widely respected and loved by the Chinese people. Excellent Soviet mass songs are widely circulated in our country, giving great encouragement and education to the struggling people. Your expression of great artistic achievements accurately proves the inevitable decline of European and American bourgeois music, providing a brilliant example and valuable reference for the world's people to build new music. The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union "on music" and Comrade Zhdanov's report will always be important documents in the history of world literature and art, not only solving the most important problems in the development of Soviet music, but also indicating a clear direction for the creative work of progressive music workers around the world, which is worthy of our deep understanding.
　　For more than ten years, Chinese new music workers, with Nie Er as their banner, have always struggled for the complete liberation of the Chinese people. After receiving the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the people and the great mentor of people's literature and art, in 1942 regarding the policy of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, new music workers began to have a clear understanding in their thoughts. Therefore, in the past seven or eight years, there have been significant changes and developments in the ideological content and national form of musical creations. But we are by no means satisfied with the existing achievements, and must continue to improve the ideology and artistry of our musical works in the people's liberation struggle and the new China's construction struggle, especially the need to strengthen the study of Soviet music and create musical works with high ideology and high artistry worthy of our great motherland.
　　We extend our highest respect to you, and sincerely suggest establishing close contact in the future, frequently exchanging experiences and works, so that we can closely unite in the struggle for world lasting peace and democracy and fight together! With warm greetings.
　　All-China Musicians Association

  　电毛主席、朱总司令致敬
    电复苏联作曲者音乐工作者愿为世界持久和平共同奋斗
    敬爱的毛主席，朱总司令：
    中华全国音乐工作者协会经过多日的筹备，今天已宣告成立了。从此以后，我们不仅有了你们所指示的文艺为人民服务并首先为工农兵服务的方针，而且有了保证执行这种方针的组织。
    过去我们在你们的伟大思想的指引下，在群众歌咏运动和新歌剧的创造上曾做了些工作，但和革命形势的发展和人民的需要来看，我们过去的成绩还很微小，而今天的任务却更巨大了。我们要忠实地遵循你们所指示的道路，以音乐的武器来为人民民主共和国战斗不息，并相信新的人民音乐事业必然要从胜利走向胜利！谨致崇高的敬礼！并祝你们永远健康！

    苏联作曲家协会转全苏联作曲者和音乐工作者：
    读到你们给中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会的贺电，无限兴奋！并且衷心感谢你们对于我们大会的关心和鼓舞。
    现在大会在我们英明的人民领袖毛主席的文艺为工农兵的正确方针指导下已经胜利闭幕，成立了以郭沫若、茅盾、周扬为领导的全国文学艺术工作者的最高领导机关，中华全国文学艺术界联合会。并且分别成立了各部门的领导机关，音乐方面成立了中华全国音乐工作者协会。
    我们无限忠诚地拥护并且参加以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵线，争取持久和平与人民民主的彻底胜利，尤其希望今后加强中国与苏联以及全世界各国人民文化艺术的交流。
    丰富的俄罗斯古曲音乐和伟大的社会主义音乐，十几年来给了中国音乐工作者以无限的启示和深刻的教育，并且广泛地受到中国人民的尊敬和热爱。优秀的苏联群众歌曲在我国广泛的流传着，给斗争着的人民以莫大的鼓舞和教育。你们在表示艺术上的伟大成就，确切的证明了欧美资产阶级音乐之必然没落，给全世界人民提供了建设新音乐的光辉范例和宝贵的借镜。联共中央“关于音乐的决定”及日丹诺夫同志的报告将永远是世界文艺史上的重要文献，不仅解决了苏联音乐发展中最重要的问题，也给全世界进步的音乐工作者指示了明确的创作方向，是值得我们深刻地体会的。
    以聂耳为旗帜的中国新音乐工作者十余年以来始终为中国人民的彻底解放而奋斗，一九四二年得到了英明的人民领袖和人民文艺的伟大的导师毛泽东同志关于文艺为工农兵的方针指导以后，新音乐工作者在思想上开始有了明确的认识，因此近七、八年来的音乐创作在思想内容上和民族形式的创作上都有了显著的改变和发展。但我们绝不满足于既有的成就，还必须在人民解放斗争中和新中国的建设斗争中继续提高我们的音乐作品的思想性和艺术性，尤其需要加强对于苏联音乐的学习，创造出无愧于我伟大祖国的具有高度思想性和高度艺术性的音乐作品。
    谨向你们表示崇高的敬意，并诚恳的建议今后建立亲密的联系，经常交换经验与作品，让我们在世界持久和平民主的斗争中紧密的围结起来共同奋斗！此致热烈的敬礼
    中华全国音乐工作者协会
    七月二十日于北平
