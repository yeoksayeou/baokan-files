Tianjin's Cooperative Enterprise
    By our Tianjin Reporting Team

    Tianjin was an excellent market for speculation and profiteering during the Kuomintang era. Whenever workers received their wages, prices immediately fluctuated dramatically. After liberation, cooperative societies were established on the basis of restoring and developing Tianjin's production, and first ensuring the livelihood of workers.

    I. Establishment Experience and Business Situation

    The establishment of cooperatives began in mid-February. We grasped the work procedure of starting with consumer cooperatives first, and clarifying the priority of workers over citizens, and public enterprises over private enterprises. We organized production teams and handicraft marketing cooperatives according to production conditions. The working method emphasized the leadership of the Municipal General Cooperative's working group, and combined with the workers' union and military representatives to conduct key cooperative experiments, so as to create experience and gradually develop. We valued the mass line, explaining the nature and principles of our cooperative operation to the masses in detail, powerfully exposing and rapidly handling the problems of the old cooperatives. We also paid attention to discovering and cultivating activists for establishing cooperatives during this period. After registration, cooperative cadres can be divided into groups for election or appointment, collect shares, and investigate the needs and quantities of goods for members to carry out business. In order to make up for the lack of cadres in the Municipal General Cooperative's working group, two short-term cooperative training courses for nearly 100 activists and worker welfare cadres from various factories were held in the early stage, and they were used as the backbone for establishing cooperatives. By April, consumer cooperatives in all public and private enterprises with more than 500 employees in the city had been established. District and street citizen consumer cooperatives were established spontaneously under the influence of worker cooperatives, but the foundation was extremely unstable, and many problems occurred. A comprehensive general inspection and rectification is planned soon. The establishment of production cooperatives began in April, starting with cotton textiles, and then organizing unemployed carpet workers to carry out production.

    In the past six months, a total of 312 cooperatives have been established (including 108 worker cooperatives; 149 citizen cooperatives; 51 institutional and school cooperatives; and 8 production cooperatives), with a total of 505,194 members (accounting for more than a quarter of the city's population), 534,555.5 cooperative shares, and a total capital of 43,502,852.83 yuan. A total of 18,611,914.5 catties of grain and more than 50 kinds of daily necessities were supplied to members, with a total value of 142,486,025.29 yuan. The total value of the above two items at cooperative prices was 144,025,347.79 yuan cheaper than the market price. This plays a major role in helping members get rid of price fluctuations and relatively stabilizing market prices and reducing commercial profits (for example, the profit of grain agency stores is indeed lower than before). The production cooperatives supported by the Municipal General Cooperative have produced 701 bolts of calico, 4,040 dozens of towels, and 125 dozens of vests. The carpet marketing cooperative has also recently delivered goods, which are said to be of excellent quality. Cooperative freight yards that connect urban and rural trade and regional material exchange have also achieved significant results. The turnover figure for June alone reached 152,670,543 yuan (of which 101,299,899 yuan came to Tianjin, with grain accounting for the majority; and 51,370,646 yuan went out of Tianjin, mainly in cloth and other cotton textiles). The exchange areas include more than 50 units of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Northeast China, Shandong, Hebei, Chahar, and Rehe provinces.

    II. Several Issues That Should Be Noted and Urgently Resolved

    Cooperative societies are an extremely meticulous and complex mass economic work. In addition, we are unfamiliar with running cooperative societies in large cities, so difficulties are inevitable. The past six months have proven that our policy and line of establishing cooperative societies are correct. In the future, we should vigorously strengthen worker consumer cooperatives, ensure the supply of workers' daily necessities, and combine the purpose of transforming consumer cities into production cities to organize handicraft production, such as cotton textiles and carpets. We should rectify the established citizen cooperatives, strengthen member education, and improve awareness, and gradually achieve the establishment of worker consumer cooperatives in different industries by different trade unions. However, there are many ideological and specific problems that are not clear enough or have unreasonable aspects that need to be resolved urgently or should be paid attention to.

    1. At the beginning of the establishment of the cooperative, due to the idea of ​​completely relying on the state economy (mainly grain) allocation, the collection of funds was not valued. Once the business is launched, this share capital, which is less than one or a little more than one catty of corn, really cannot play any role. On the other hand, due to the poor cooperation with the grain company, the cooperative business is essentially a passive grain store that is completely allocated. The quality is good and bad, and the supply is sometimes not timely (this is a problem that is still entangled). Recently, the Municipal General Cooperative sent people to Jinan, Xuzhou and other places to purchase wheat, but the number was very small, but this preliminary establishment of its own independent business is necessary. In addition to the state can lend a part, the main source of funds is to rely on members (this must be combined with the members' consciousness and the excellent work efficiency of the cooperative itself to be solved). But this is a long process, so it is very important to have an appropriate close cooperation with the state economy. For example, each cooperative should conduct a survey of members' needs for goods and quantities in advance, and report to the grain company or the state factory; both parties strictly implement the credit relationship: the grain company must supply the quantity on time and ensure the quality, and the cooperative must pay on time and not delay, etc.

    2. Grain purchase and transportation issues. In the past six months, except for a very small number of larger factories and societies that directly pick up goods from the grain company, the general practice is for the General Cooperative to transport grain from the trading company back to its own warehouse, and then distribute it to each cooperative for transportation. The preferential treatment of coarse grains below 10% is therefore consumed by one-half, not to mention the waste of manpower. Therefore, the Municipal General Cooperative sold only 1.2 million catties of coarse grains in June, with an average of less than three catties per person. At this moment, the Municipal General Cooperative plans to discuss with the grain company that each cooperative will directly pick up the grain from the nearby grain store, which can save freight and reduce unnecessary procedures.

    3. The Municipal General Cooperative currently has a business department that operates daily necessities for members' needs, and most of the goods are purchased from various public and private factories in Tianjin. It is undoubtedly very difficult to completely rely on the General Cooperative to supply the daily needs of 500,000 members in Tianjin, and in fact, many lower-level cooperatives have become agency stores for private merchants. For this reason, the General Cooperative should focus on organizing joint procurement by various cooperatives in the future. Each cooperative should first conduct a demand survey among members, and then directly transport the goods back to the city or other factories at wholesale prices or preferential prices lower than wholesale prices through the organization or introduction of the Municipal General Cooperative. This can save the General Cooperative's unnecessary operating procedures and freight. The General Cooperative can operate items that are not easily available to members, such as local products and more advanced goods.

    4. In order to better meet the needs of members, the Municipal General Cooperative should closely combine with state-owned enterprises and factories or partially control production factories and vigorously organize some family members to carry out production around consumption. The former, such as soy sauce, alkaline soap, and knitting factories, should be organically combined with the sales of production cooperatives; the latter, such as grinding flour and shaking briquettes. Some cooperatives in Tianjin have established these two productions, which proves that this plays a considerable role in consolidating consumer cooperatives. For example, private merchants charge 84 catties of flour for every 100 catties of corn, while self-processing can get 94 to 96 catties of flour, a difference of 8 to 10 catties, and the quality can be guaranteed. This can be gradually promoted in the future according to the different conditions of each cooperative.

    5. Rectification of citizen cooperatives. The initial intention of the citizen cooperatives was to focus on organizing handicraft workers and coolies in the form of street areas to ensure their food and stabilize prices. However, in April, due to the large price fluctuations, the general public saw the benefits of the cooperatives, so they asked to establish them. From 22 cooperatives with 17,672 people in March, it increased to 101 cooperatives in April, with a total of 124,630 members. By May, it increased to 149 cooperatives, with a total of 235,512 members. This development process was rapid. Due to poor leadership (only introduced by the district economic section and approved by the Municipal General Cooperative), the organization is not sound, the operating ability is weak, and the general members do not have a correct understanding of the cooperative, such as the so-called "buy if it's cheap, don't buy if it's not cheap, oppose if it's not cheap" argument. Cadre corruption (more than a dozen cooperatives with dozens of cases have been discovered in May and June alone, including five cases in 27th Street in the Eighth District), lack of planning in operation (blindly purchasing goods, members reselling the materials they purchased, complicated procedures, failure to disclose accounts in a timely manner, etc.), failure to pay the General Cooperative for the goods on time, and depositing them in private banks to generate interest or hoard materials (this increases the market price fluctuation performance and violates the principles of the cooperative, which should be paid special attention to and thoroughly investigated), etc. For this reason, the Municipal General Cooperative is experimenting with gradually transforming the mixed citizen cooperatives into regional cooperatives of trade union members by combining with established or planned trade unions. Through the work of the trade union, we will vigorously educate members, improve the organization and business operations of the cooperative, and appropriately increase funds and carry out production around consumption.

　　天津的合作事业
    本报天津报导组
    天津是个国民党时期投机倒把的绝好市场，每当职工发下工资，物价立即引起剧烈波动。解放后合作社是在恢复与发展津市生产而先必须保证职工生活的基础上建立起来的。
    一、建社经验和业务情况
    二月中旬开始建社。把握了先从消费社着手，并明确先工人后市民、先公营后私营的工作程序，根据生产条件组织了生产小组和手工业供销社。工作方式是强调市总社工作组的领导，并结合职工会、军代表作重点社试验，以创造经验逐步开展。重视群众路线，向群众详细解释我们办合作社的性质和方针，有力揭发和迅速处理旧社问题。并注意在这个时期发现和培养组社的积极分子。进行登记后，即可划分小组选举或聘请合作社干部，收集股金，调查社员需求物品和数量以开展业务。为弥补市总社工作组干部的缺乏，于初期召开了两期近百人的各厂积极分子和职工福利干部短期合作训练班并以其为组社骨干，至四月份全市五百职工以上的公、私营企业消费社全部组成。区街市民消费社则在职工社建立的影响下，纷纷自发成立，基础极不巩固，发生问题很多，近拟进行全面的总检查和整顿。生产社建立始于四月，先从棉织品着手，后又组织失业地毡工人进行生产。
    半年来，共组社三一二个（其中职工社一○八个；市民社一四九个；机关学校社五十一个；生产社八个），共社员五○五、一九四人（占全市人口四分之一强），五三四、五五五·五社股，共资金四三、五○二、八五二·八三元。供给社员粮食计一八、六一一、九一四·五斤，日用品五十余种，总值为一四二、四八六、○二五·二九元。以上两项物品总值社价较市价便宜达一四四、○二五、三四七·七九元。这对社员摆脱物价波动和相对地平稳市场价格降低商业利润上起着重大作用（如粮食代售店看利确较前要低一些）。市总社扶植下的生产社共出花条布七○一匹、毛巾四○四○打、背心一二五打，地毡供销社最近亦已出货，据称质量颇佳。沟通城乡贸易和地区物资交换的合作货栈亦发生了显著成效。六月份一个月的统计成交数字达一五二、六七○、五四三元（其中进津者为一○一、二九九、八九九元以粮食为大宗；出津者以布匹及其他棉织品为主共值五一、三七○、六四六元）。交流地区包括东北、山东、河北、察哈尔、热河等省五十余单位各级供销社。
    二、几个应该注意和急待解决的问题
    合作社是一个极端细致而复杂的群众性经济工作，加之我们在大城市办合作社的生疏，困难是免不了的。半年来我们的组社方针、路线证明是正确的。今后工作当为大力加强职工消费社，保证职工生活必需品的供给，结合变消费城市为生产城市的目的，组织手工业生产，如棉织、地毡等，整顿已建立的市民社，加强社员教育，提高觉悟，逐步达到以不同行业的职工会来建立不同行业的职工消费社。但有许多思想和具体问题不够明确或有不合理的地方应急待解决或应引起注意的。
    １、建社之初由于有完全依靠国家经济（主要是粮食）配售的思想，所以不重视资金的收集。业务一经开展，这不足当时一斤或一斤多的折实玉米股金，确实起不了什么作用。另方面因与粮食公司配合较差，因此合作社业务经营实质是处于完全被动地位的配粮商店，质量有好有坏，供应有时不够及时（这是至今纠缠不清的问题）。最近市总社为此曾派人去济南、徐州一带采购小麦，然为数很小，但这种初步建立自己独立的业务是必要的。资金除国家可以贷予一部分外，主要是依靠社员（这是要结合社员的自觉性和合作社本身的优良工作效能才得解决）。但这是一个长过程，因之与国家经济取得适当地密切配合是很重要的问题。如各社应在事前进行社员需求物品和数量的调查，报告粮食公司或国家工厂；双方严格执行信用关系：粮食公司必须按时供给数量和保证质量，合作社则须按时付款不得拖延等。
    ２、粮食购运问题。半年来，除极少数较大工厂社会直接向粮食公司取货外，一般是由总社把粮食从贸易公司运回自己仓库，再分发给各社运回。低于百分之十的粗粮优待，因之消耗二分之一，人力浪费更不待说。故六月份市总社售出粗粮仅一百二十万斤，每人平均不足三斤。刻市总社拟与粮食公司商量各社由附近粮栈直接取回，既能节省运费又能减少不必要的手续。
    ３、市总社刻有营业部一处，经营社员需求日用品，货物多购自天津各公、私营工厂。完全依靠总社供给津市五十万社员的日用需求量，无疑是很困难的，而实际上许多下层社已成为私商的代售店。为此总社今后应着重组织各社的联合采购。各社在社员中先进行需求调查，通过市总社的组织或介绍向本市或外埠各工厂按批发价或低于批发价的优待批货，直接运回。这可省除总社的不必要经营手续和运费。而总社则可经营社员不易购得的物品。如各地土产和较高级的货物。
    ４、为更好的满足社员需要，市总社应与国营企业工厂密切结合或部分掌握生产工厂及大力组织某些家属社员围绕消费进行生产。前者如酱油、碱胰、针织工厂并与生产合作社销路有机结合起来；后者如磨粉加工、摇煤球等。津市已有部分社建立这两项生产，证明这对巩固消费社起相当大的作用。如玉米每百斤交私商代磨给粉八十四斤，而自己加工则可得粉九十四至九十六斤，前后相差为八至十斤，并可保证质量。今后当可根据各社不同情况逐步推广。
    ５、市民社整顿问题。市民社的最初意图是拟通过街区形式重点地组织手工业工人、苦力、以保证他们的食粮和稳定物价。但在四月份因物价波动较大，一般市民见合作社确有好处，因此纷纷要求成立。由三月份的二十二个社的一七、六七二人增至四月份为一○一个社，共社员一二四、六三○人，至五月份则增至一四九个社，共社员二三五、五一二人，这个发展过程是飞跃的。由于领导较差（只是经区经济股介绍由市总社批准）。因此，组织不够健全，经营能力薄弱，一般社员对合作社认识不够正确，如传说中的所谓“便宜就买，少便宜不买，不便宜反对”的论调。干部贪污（五六月份仅发觉者有十余社共数十起，其中八区二十七街即达五次），经营缺乏计划（盲目购货，社员转卖自己购得物资，手续繁乱，不能及时公开帐目等），赊购总社物品不按时交款，而存入私人银行中生息或囤集物资（这是增加市场物价波动的性能，违反合作社的原则，应特别引起注意和加以澈查）等情况。为此，市总社正试验结合已建立或正在筹组中的行业工会进行逐步将混合性的市民社转化为以行业工会会员的地区合作社。通过工会工作大力教育社员，健全社务组织和业务经营，并适当地增加资金和开展围绕消费的生产。
