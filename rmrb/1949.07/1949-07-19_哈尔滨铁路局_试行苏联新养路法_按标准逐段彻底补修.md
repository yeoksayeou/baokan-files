Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. The Harbin Railway Bureau has successfully implemented the Soviet New Track Maintenance and Repair Method. This is another significant achievement following the adoption of the Soviet block train system and the new operational methods, and it will be widely promoted and implemented throughout Northeast China's railways. The New Track Maintenance and Repair Method involves thoroughly investigating all lines under the jurisdiction of each track maintenance section, specifically in terms of main lines, sidings, and turnouts. It also entails clearly determining the work to be done per kilometer, along with the required labor and materials. Then, a plan is formulated based on the workforce. Except for track patrolmen, the majority of the maintenance workers form fixed repair teams, which systematically and thoroughly repair sections according to engineering standards, following a specific plan and work order each day. A small number of maintenance workers (approximately one-third) are retained to handle certain temporary and urgent small repairs. After completing their daily work, track maintenance workers implement a strict inspection system based on engineering standards, grading their performance into excellent, good, and qualified categories, and creating a formal inspection record. Those who qualify receive a certificate from the engineering department; those who do not qualify must redo the work until it meets the standards. According to the Harbin Railway Bureau's experience since the trial implementation of this new track maintenance method began in May, it has the following advantages over the previous methods of performing individual tasks such as replacing sleepers and leveling (straightening and flattening the track) on a seasonal basis: (1) It is convenient for planning, organization, leadership, and inspection. (2) The work has a specific order and steps, avoiding rework and repetitive tasks. (3) The work has specific standards, making it easy to maintain the balanced and good condition of the lines. (4) It can more rationally organize the workforce, facilitating the combination of experienced and new workers' skills, and quickly familiarizing them with the work methods. Currently, various engineering departments of the bureau, such as Hailun, Suihua, and Shuangcheng, have widely implemented it. The Jilin, Qiqihar, Jinzhou, and other railway bureaus have dispatched or are about to dispatch experienced supervisors and technicians to the Harbin Railway Bureau to study this new working method in preparation for its implementation in the near future.

    试行苏联新养路法
    按标准逐段彻底补修
    【新华社沈阳十六日电】哈尔滨铁路管理局试行苏联新养路补修法已获成功。这是继采用苏联包乘制与新运行法后的又一巨大收获，将被在全东北铁路范围内普遍推广实行。新养路补修法系将每个养路工区所管全部线路，按本线、侧线、道岔三方面，分别加以彻底调查，将每公里所应作的工作及其所需人工数和材料调查清楚，然后按劳动力作出计划。除巡道工以外，以大部分养路工组成固定的补修班，每天按一定的计划，一定的工作秩序，逐段按工程标准彻底补修。另留少数养路工（约三分之一）担当某些临时突击小补修工作。养路工人于每日工作完成后，根据工程标准实行严格检查制度，按成绩分为优良、良好、合格三个等级，作成正式检查纪录。合格者，由工务段发给证明书，不合格者重作，直到够标准为止。这一新的养路工作方法，根据哈尔滨铁路管理局自五月开始试行以来的经验，证明较过去按季节和按换枕木、找水平（使路轨直而平）等每项作业一次一次单独进行的方法，有如下好处：（一）便于计划，好组织，好领导，好检查。（二）工作有一定顺序和步骤，不返工，免去重复的工作。（三）工作有一定的标准，容易保持线路的均衡良好状态。（四）能更合理地组织劳动力，新老工人技术易配合，作业方法很快能熟悉。现该局各工务段如海伦、绥化、双城堡等，均已普遍实行。吉林、齐齐哈尔、锦州等铁路管理局，已派或即将选派有经验的监工员、技术员，赴哈尔滨铁路局研究这一新工作法，准备在短期内实行。
