Flood Control Organizations Must Strengthen to Ensure No Delays When Water Rises
　　冀鲁豫日报 Publishes Commentary Calling For Action
[Ji Lu Yu Electric] Since the deployment of flood control work in Ji Lu Yu, most areas have deployed to the village before the "July 7th" incident, and various flood control facilities have been prepared, laying the foundation for this year's flood control work. However, individual counties and sections have not fully complied with the regulations of the Yellow River Committee's flood control meeting and have not immediately prepared. Some have simply made a general deployment and considered the matter closed. For example, in Dongming and Nanhua, after the first major flood of the flood season, they have not yet studied how to get flood control personnel on the dyke. More seriously, some cadres do not take notes at county flood control meetings, and at village cadre meetings, not only is the spirit of flood control not fully implemented, but they also say: "This organization, that organization, so much trouble. When the water rises, who dares not go on the dyke with a single notice?" There are also district cadres who tell village cadres to order in the villages: "Wherever the breach occurs, the head of that place will be killed." This kind of careless, simplistic, and commandist bad style has caused great losses to flood control work. In some places, during the rise of water, flood control personnel were not mobilized effectively, or even could not be mobilized. In order to ensure that the Yellow River does not breach and to protect the interests of the people, the Ji Lu Yu Daily specially published a commentary calling for: (1) Party committees and governments and repair and protection agencies along the river must organize capable cadres to go deep into the villages along the river to widely carry out flood control propaganda to protect great production. Cadres and the masses must be highly vigilant in their thinking, and no negligence is allowed; (2) According to the flood control resolution of the Yellow River Committee, improve various organizational structures, especially village-level organizations, to ensure that they can go on the dyke at any time without delay. Shouzhang has done a better job in this regard, not only selecting capable militia members to serve as long-term flood control personnel, but also paying attention to the quality of flood control personnel; (3) Strengthen the inspection system; oppose unauthorized actions and bureaucracy and localism; (4) Flood control work must be combined with production work. When organizing flood control in villages along the river, we must pay attention to the production of the masses and not delay agricultural time.

　　防汛组织要加强保证水涨不误事
    冀鲁豫日报著论号召
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫自布置防汛工作后，各地一般均于“七七”前布置到村，各种防汛设施并都已准备就绪，打下了今年防汛工作的基础。但个别县段还没完全遵照黄委会防汛会议的规定，没立即准备，有的则笼统的布置一下完事。如东明、南华入汛后第一次大水已过，还没研究好防汛员上堤的办法。更严重的是个别干部在县开防汛会议不作笔记，到村干会上，不但将防汛精神贯彻不全，并说：这组织那组织，多麻烦、水一涨，一声通知谁敢不上堤？还有的区干叫村干到村下命令：“哪里开了口子杀哪里的头。”这种粗枝大叶、简单化、命令主义的坏作风，使防汛工作受到很大损失。有些地方在涨水时，防汛员调动不灵，甚至调不动。为了确保黄河不决口，保卫人民的利益，冀鲁豫日报特著论号召：（一）沿河党委、政府和修防机关，必须组织有力干部深入沿河各村，广泛进行保卫大生产的防汛宣传，干部、群众在思想上都必须高度警惕，绝不容许任何麻痹大意；（二）根据黄委会防汛决议，健全各种组织机构，特别是村级组织，保证随时上堤不误事。这点寿张做的较好，不但挑选了精干的自卫队员充任长期防汛员，并且注意了防汛员的质量；（三）加强检查制度；反对擅自行动和官僚主义、地方主义；（四）防汛工作要与生产工作结合起来。在组织沿河各村防汛时，必须注意群众生产，不误农时。
