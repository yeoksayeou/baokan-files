Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 19th: According to a Warsaw dispatch from the Polish News Agency: At a recent meeting of the Warsaw Provincial Organization of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish Prime Minister and member of the Political Bureau of the United Workers' Party, Minc, discussed the Polish government's agricultural policy, stating: The government announced a new agricultural policy last July. This policy systematically helps and protects small and middle farmers, shielding them from capitalist exploitation. At the same time, it also intends to gradually limit capitalist elements in the countryside and point out the prospect of socialist transformation of agriculture to the peasants. Minc said: This policy was misunderstood by some people, who thought that agricultural production would suffer as a result. However, a year has passed. Rich peasants have been restricted, subjected to increased property taxes, and removed from cooperatives. Small and middle farmers have been protected, and land yields have increased. The number of horses and cattle, especially pigs, has also increased, as has the consumption of artificial fertilizers. Minc then spoke about agricultural production cooperatives. He said: Last year, peasants did not understand cooperatives very well. However, after a year, peasants are not only talking about the agricultural production cooperative movement, but in some places, they have also organized production cooperatives themselves. Despite all hostile propaganda, the peasants have gradually become convinced that the Polish United Workers' Party does not force them to join production cooperatives, but seeks to gradually develop cooperatives with the voluntary support of the peasants and when their material conditions have improved. Note: There are currently 4.8 million working people in Poland participating in cooperatives, of which consumer cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives each account for about half.

    明兹谈波农业政策
    有系统地保护小农中农
    五百万劳动人民参加合作社
    【新华社北平十九日电】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：在波兰统一工人党华沙省组织最近举行的会议上，波兰的总理、统一工人党政治局委员明兹谈波兰政府的农业政策称：政府于去年七月宣布了农业新政策。这一政策是有系统地帮助和保护小农和中农，使他们不受资本主义的剥削；同时，也打算逐渐地限制农村中资本主义的因素，并向农民指出农业的社会主义化转变的远景。明兹说：这一政策曾经被有些人误解为农业生产将因此受到损失。但是，一年过去了。富农受到了限制，他们被加征了不动产税和被清除出合作社，小农和中农受到了保护，而土地的收获量业已增加了。马和牛，尤其是猪的数目，也增加了。人造肥料的消费量也如此。明兹接着谈到农业生产合作社。他说：去年，农民还不大了解合作社。然而，一年之后，农民们不但谈论着农业生产合作社运动，并且有些地方，他们自己也组织了生产合作社。尽管有一切敌意的宣传，但农民们已逐渐深信：波兰统一工人党并不强迫他们参加生产合作社，而是在农民们自愿的支持下，在他们的物质条件已有改进时，力求使合作社逐渐发展起来。按：波兰现有四百八十万劳动人民参加了合作社，其中属于消费合作社和农业生产合作社的约各占一半。
