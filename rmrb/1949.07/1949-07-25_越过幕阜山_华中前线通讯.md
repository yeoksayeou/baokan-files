　　Crossing Mount Mufu
  　　Dispatches from the Central China Front
    When the task of crossing the Mufu Mountain area bordering Hunan and Hubei to advance into Hunan was assigned to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army, all commanders and fighters began preparations with excitement, including lightening their loads, making straw sandals, and tidying up their bamboo hats. On July 11th, the vanguard began entering the mountainous area. The terrain was treacherous all the way, with mountain paths winding between cliffs, only about a foot wide. Engineers constantly repaired and opened roads along the way, enabling the rapid advance of the following troops.

    The climate in the mountainous area was sometimes scorching, making people dizzy with heat; at other times, there were torrential downpours, with water rushing down the mountainsides, making the narrow paths muddy and difficult to traverse. A slight carelessness could lead to the danger of falling into the rapid currents of the mountain streams. When a certain unit passed through a 45-li mountain range, they disassembled their heavy weapons and carried them in separate pieces. The soldiers leading the pack animals proceeded with extra caution. When crossing a small river in front of the mountain, which could normally be stepped over, a sudden downpour caused the mountain water to rise rapidly, and the soldiers had to find ways to cross using rafts and triangular boats. Along the way, weapons and ammunition were soaked by rain and sweat, and had to be dried and reorganized during each rest stop. When a certain unit passed through a mountain range where there were no inhabitants within 40 or 50 li, the soldiers connected their raincoats to form tent shelters for the night.

    When passing through the mountainous area, the people, knowing it was the People's Liberation Army, happily said, "The Red Army has returned after sixteen years!" Everyone offered the little grain and dried sweet potatoes they had left to the soldiers. Encouraged by the masses' enthusiasm, the soldiers were in high spirits, advanced bravely, and successfully crossed the steep Mufu Mountain area.

　　越过幕阜山
  　华中前线通讯
    当越过湘鄂交界的幕阜山区、进军湖南的任务分配给人民解放军第四野战军某部时，全体指战员以兴奋的心情，进行减轻行装，打草鞋，整理斗笠等准备工作。七月十一日，先头部队开始进入山区。一路地形险阻，山道蜿蜒在悬崖峭壁之间，宽仅一尺左右。工兵沿途不断修补开辟道路，使后续大队迅速前进。
    山区里的气候，时而烈日当头，热得令人发晕；时而却又暴雨倾泻，流水从山壁冲下，使羊肠小路泥滑难行，稍微不慎，就有落入山涧急流中的危险。某部经过一座四十五里长的山岭时，将重武器都拆卸开分件搬运。牵牲口的战士更是小心翼翼行进。经过山前的一道小河时，平常这里是可以一步越过的，但在一阵急雨之后，山水暴发，战士们只得设法用木筏和三角舟摆渡。一路上武器弹药被雨水和汗水弄湿了，每天休息时都要擦干整理。某部通过一座山岭时，四五十里以内渺无人烟，战士们便把雨衣连成篷帐宿营。
    在山区经过时，老百姓知道是解放军，都高兴地说：十六年前的红军又回来了。大家纷纷把自己仅存的一点粮食和红薯干送给战士们。在群众这样热情的鼓舞下，战士们都精神百倍，奋发前进，胜利越过了险峻的幕阜山区。
