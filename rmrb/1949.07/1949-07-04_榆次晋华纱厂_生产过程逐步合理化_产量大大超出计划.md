(Taiyuan Electric) The Yuci Jinhua Cotton Mill produced 361,690.5 pounds of yarn in May, equivalent to 904.2 pieces, exceeding the original plan of 350,612.5 pounds by 5,078 pounds. Work efficiency reached 90.9%, an increase of 1.6% compared to 89.3% in April. The increase in production efficiency is mainly due to the increased political awareness of all workers, who put forward suggestions for improving production, and carried out mutual encouragement and criticism, correcting shortcomings in their work, and rationalizing the production process. In the production competition, Liu Qingsheng, the leader of the Fine Yarn Group A, suggested changing the fine spinning machines on the west side to spin heavy yarn regularly, and the ones on the east side to spin light yarn regularly, which solved the problem of the fine spinning machines on the west side being difficult to spin. This change not only increased output and made packaging more convenient, but also overcame the shortcomings of not being able to work due to the lack of light or heavy yarn, and eliminated the past disputes among workers over spinning light or heavy yarn. Sun Shude of Fine Yarn Group C suggested appropriately adjusting the roller distance, making previously difficult work easier. In the past, coarse yarn was often spun with single-end yarn and double-end yarn. After everyone suggested stamping the yarn, the above-mentioned problems almost disappeared. In April, fine yarn doffing required a one-minute stop, but as a result of the competition, it was reduced to 50 seconds. In addition to the above-mentioned suggestions for improving the production process, workers also carried out criticism among themselves. Workers in the fine spinning workshop suggested to the yarn carriers that the sweeping of the machine boards should be done cleanly. The winding workers suggested to the machine workers not to put small yarns casually on the winding bags. Wang Tuni, a fine spinning and winding worker, wound quickly and cleanly, and the blackboard newspaper praised her, promoting competition between another winding worker, Li Denghua, and Wang Tuni, which further improved their production. Currently, the entire factory is caught up in a wave of competition.

　　榆次晋华纱厂 　 生产过程逐步合理化  产量大大超出计划
    【太原电】榆次晋华纱厂五月份共产纱三六一六九零点五磅，折合九零四点二件，较原定计划三五零六一二点五磅多产五零七八磅；工作效率达到百分之九零点九，较四月份百分之八九点三提高百分之一点六。生产效率提高主要是由于全厂职工政治觉悟提高，提出改进生产意见，并开展了互相勉励和批评，改正了工作中的缺点，生产过程趋于合理化。生产竞赛中，细甲组长刘庆生建议，把西边的细纱机改成经常纺重纱，东边的经常纺轻纱，解决了西边的细纱机不好纺的缺点。这一改变，不特产量提高，成包便利，同时克服了因无轻纱或重纱不能工作的缺点，且过去工友因纺轻纱或纺重纱的争执也消灭了。细丙摇车孙树德提议适当的调整罗拉距离，使以前难做的活变成好做了。过去，粗纱经常纺单头纱和双头纱，大家提议在纱上盖章后，上述毛病几乎没有了。四月份细纱落纱须停车一分钟，竞赛的结果，减到五十秒。除了上面这些改良生产过程的建议外，工友间又开展批评，细纱间当车工给托纱工提出扫车板应当扫干净。络纱工给当车工提出不要在络纱袋上随便放小纱。细纱络纱工王兔妮，络纱快，又清洁，黑板报即给以表扬，推动了另一络纱工李登花和王兔妮竞赛，使她们的生产更加提高。目前全厂正卷入竞赛热潮中。
