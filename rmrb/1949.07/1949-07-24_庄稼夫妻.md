Early morning, water the fields thoroughly;
Mid-morning, finish transplanting rice seedlings;
Noon, hold a farmers' association meeting;
Afternoon, busy weeding;
Evening, feed the cattle;
After supper, put the rope and carrying pole by your head,
Stretch out your legs, and sleep soundly.

The fifth lunar month has long days and short nights,
Labor dreams cannot be long,
The dawn chicken
Flaps its wings,
The rooster
Crows at daybreak.

The newly married bride,
Wakes up her young husband:
Wake up! Wake up!
The wheat ears are turning yellow,
Let's go harvest it!

The husband gets off the bed;
The wife opens the door and window;
The husband walks out the door;
The wife is busy carrying water;
In the fields, the wheat!
Yellow and fragrant.
At home!
The pigs are fed full,
The cattle are on the hillside.
In the fields!
Wheat piled into bundle after bundle,
Arranged in row after row.
At home!
The stove fire is burning fiercely, the bellows are roaring,
Golden rice is cooking in the pot,
Corn is ground into yellow dry rations,
Last year's pickled vegetables, salted eggs,
The wife carefully picks them out and sends them to her husband.

The wife puts down the carrying pole,
The husband squats by the tree,
The wife serves the rice,
The husband takes the dry rations,
A farmer's people eat a farmer's meal,
A farmer's meal tastes delicious.

The wife's face is full of smiles,
The husband's face is beaming,
The wife rolls up her sleeves and wraps her head,
--I'm coming too! I'm coming to help!
The couple works together to harvest,
How could women lag behind?
With a flick of the wrist, the wheat falls,
The sickle makes a rustling sound,
Wheat falls, two rows fall,
The two bend down to bind it.
Twelve in a row,
Two rows bundled into twelve pairs,
The sun rises high,
The wheat smells fragrant.

One face is full of smiles,
The smiling face gleams dark,
One face is beaming,
The face has a rosy glow,
One harvests quickly,
One is strong in labor,
One is a young man,
One is a liberated woman,
Laboring couples work hard in production,
There is hope for getting rich.

There's no need for others to compose a liberation song,
Labor songs can be sung by ourselves:
The land is our life,
We suffer in the soil, we grow in the soil,
Today the land is liberated,
Farming couples have blessings to enjoy,
Ahead of us is our leader,
We rely on the Communist Party.
July 1949, in Zhangjiakou.

　　庄稼夫妻
    甄崇德
    清早，放足水；
    前晌，插完秧；
    晌午，开农会；
    后晌，锄苗忙；
    傍晚，喂了牛；
    吃罢夜饭，把绳儿扁担放头旁，
    伸脚，睡的香。
　
    五月天长夜儿短，
    劳动梦儿不能长，
    黎鸡
    打了翅，
    公鸡
    叫天亮。
　
    刚过门的新娘，
    拍醒了年青的郎：
    醒啊！醒啊！
    麦子黄了穗，
    咱去收割忙。
　
    丈夫，下了炕；
    妻子，开门窗；
    丈夫，门外走；
    妻子，担水忙；
    地里，麦子呀！
    黄成一片香。
    家里呵！
    猪儿喂饱，
    牛儿上山岗。
    地里呵！
    麦子堆成一捆又一捆，
    排了一行又一行。
    家里呵！
    炉火着的猛，风箱拉的响，
    滚锅下金米，
    玉米搓成黄干粮，
    压年的黄菜，盐鸡蛋，
    妻子挑好送给郎。
　
    妻子放了担，
    丈夫蹲树旁，
    妻子盛上饭，
    丈夫拿干粮，
    庄稼人儿庄稼饭，
    庄稼饭儿吃的香。
　
    妻子满脸笑，
    丈夫喜气扬，
    妻子卷好衣袖包好头，
    ——我也来呀！我也来帮忙！
    夫妻两人动手割，
    妇女哪肯落后方？
    手起麦子倒，
    镰刀沙沙响，
    麦子倒，倒两行，
    两人弯腰来捆绑。
    一行十二个，
    两行捆成十二双，
    太阳升的高，
    麦子喷喷香。
　
    一个满脸笑，
    笑脸闪黑光，
    一个喜气扬，
    脸上有红光，
    一个割的快，
    一个劳动强，
    一个年青汉，
    一个翻身娘，
    劳动夫妻勤生产，
    发家致富有指望。
　
    翻身曲儿不用旁人编，
    劳动歌儿自己都会唱：
    土地是咱的命，
    咱在土里受苦，土里长，
    今天土地得解放，
    庄稼夫妻有福享，
    前面有咱领路人，
    咱们依靠共产党。
    　四九年七月于张垣。
