Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 5th: TASS, Moscow—Moscow bid farewell to Dimitrov on July 2nd. Dimitrov's coffin was placed in the Hall of Columns of the House of Trade Unions at 7 p.m. on the 2nd. A huge velvet red flag edged with crepe, bearing the words "Workers of All Countries, Unite!" half-covered the coffin. The national flags of the Soviet Union's constituent republics hung on the marble columns of the hall. Frosted glass chandeliers were covered with black gauze. Many wreaths were displayed in the hall. A large wreath of flowers presented by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, placed in front of the coffin, was tied with a ribbon inscribed "To the outstanding leader of the international working-class movement, to our comrade and brother, Dimitrov." Standing beside the coffin were the deceased's wife, children, relatives, and friends, representatives of the Bulgarian people, representatives of the Bulgarian government and the Bulgarian Communist Party: Chervenkov, Zhankov, and Yugov—who arrived here from Sofia on July 1st and will transport the coffin back to Bulgaria from Moscow. The first group of honor guards included Comrade Popov, secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee and the Moscow City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and Comrade Chervenkov, secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and Yugov, Bulgarian Minister of the Interior. Tens of thousands of Moscow workers converged into two endless streams heading towards the House of Trade Unions. They went to pay their last respects to the faithful comrade-in-arms of Lenin and Stalin, to the selfless fighter who devoted his entire heroic life to the cause of communism. Funeral music resounded throughout the hall. Representatives from all districts of Moscow, in an endless stream, presented wreaths to mourn the deceased, who was loved by all the Soviet people and progressive humanity worldwide. The second group of honor guards included Suslov, Ponomarenko, and Shkiryatov, secretaries of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, and Tivokhin, Yefremov, and Malyshev, deputy chairmen of the Soviet Council of Ministers. Representatives from the embassies and legations in Moscow of various people's republics—Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Korea, Mongolia, Albania—went to present wreaths. At 11:20 p.m., Stalin entered the hall and stood guard with Malenkov, Beria, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Shvernik, and Bulganin. More and more wreaths arrived. A large wreath of flowers near the coffin was tied with a red ribbon, inscribed: "To dear friend and comrade Dimitrov. Respectfully presented by Stalin." It was late at night, but the flow of people continued unabated. Teams of working people silently walked past the coffin, bidding farewell to their comrade and friend.
