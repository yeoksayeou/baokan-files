North China Agricultural Conference Summarizes Half-Year Production
Agricultural Plan Basically Completed
Central Hebei Exceeds Planned Cotton and Peanut Planting
Taihang Makes All-Out Effort to Eradicate Locusts, Saving Large Amount of Seedlings
[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The North China Agricultural Production Conference, which opened on the 12th, quickly had the directors of the agricultural offices of each administrative region report on the general agricultural production situation in their respective areas. The reports from each region concluded on the 14th. On the 15th, Comrade Zhang Chong, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, gave a summary report on agricultural production for the first half of the year, explaining in detail the situations regarding water conservancy, afforestation, animal husbandry, locust eradication, land reclamation, and fertilization. On the morning of the 16th, Comrade Song Shaowen, Secretary-General of the North China Financial and Economic Committee, delivered a report to the conference, and the meeting adjourned in the afternoon. The conference is expected to last another four or five days. Starting from the 17th, group discussions will be held to discuss Deputy Minister Zhang's summary report, the production plan for next year, and how urban industry can support agricultural production, after which a summary will be made. Judging from the reports of various regions, the agricultural production plan for the first half of this year in North China has been basically successfully completed under the strong leadership of party and government organs at all levels and the efforts of the vast number of peasants, after overcoming disasters such as drought, pests, and frost. The Central Hebei and Southern Hebei regions are the main cotton-producing areas in North China. In Central Hebei, there was no rain before the Xiaoman solar term, and only a portion of spring crops were planted on alkaline wetlands, while most of the dry land was not planted. After April 10th, the entire region began to fight the drought with all its strength. After overcoming the ideological obstacles of cadres and the masses who "rely on the heavens for food" and "produce the same way without leadership," the entire region launched a surge of digging wells, repairing canals, carrying water, and planting crops. As a result, more than 3.2 million mu of cotton were planted, exceeding the original plan of 3 million mu; 1.9 million mu of peanuts were planted, exceeding the original plan by 400,000 mu. According to statistics from 40 counties, more than 100,000 new earthen wells and more than 3,100 new brick wells were dug during the concentrated planting, which played a significant role in completing this year's production plan. The cotton has now blossomed, and the millet is more than a foot tall. If there are no more floods or insect pests, a bumper harvest can be expected this autumn. In Southern Hebei, the entire region experienced a spring drought before Grain Rain, and concentrated planting began in late April. All men, women, old, and young, as well as cadres, were mobilized throughout the region, which was unprecedented in Southern Hebei. After a month of effort, more than 4.8 million mu of cotton were planted, completing 93.7% of the original plan. In the Taihang region, locust nymphs occurred in one-third of the area in early June. The leadership promptly organized the masses to capture and kill them, mobilizing more than 900,000 people to participate in this work (excluding the Fourth Special District), launching a vigorous campaign to eradicate locusts. After eighteen days of intense fighting, the locust nymphs were basically eliminated, saving more than 1.4 million mu of seedlings. This is a major feature of agricultural production in the region this year. Spring seedlings in the mountainous areas of Changzhi and Zuoquan were severely affected, but the replanting situation is good, and the seedlings along the Pinghan Railway are also growing well. The planting work in Eastern Hebei this year was mainly completed during the rush planting after the rain. A total of 930,000 mu of cotton were planted, slightly less than the original plan of 1 million mu, while the planting area of peanuts exceeded the original plan of 900,000 mu. More than 2 million mu of autumn wheat and spring wheat were planted, exceeding the original plan. The seedlings in various places have been hoed two to three times and are in good condition. In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, after the North China Bureau and the North China People's Government issued instructions on combating drought and preparing for famine at the end of May, the entire region determined that leading production was the overriding task. The region should plant 1.5 million mu of cotton. According to statistics from 43 counties, 1.23 million mu have been planted; 15.05 million hemp seeds have been planted. If each plant yields four taels, it is expected to exceed the original plan. This year, a widespread outbreak of cattle plague occurred in Chahar Province, affecting 20 counties. In Laishui in western Hebei and Lingqiu in northern Yanbei alone, more than 5,000 heads of cattle died, causing a major difficulty for agricultural production this spring. Fortunately, timely prevention and treatment quickly eradicated the cattle plague. This spring, the region planted a total of 5.95 million trees, exceeding the original planned number; 783 new and repaired old canals were built; and, together with digging wells and purchasing waterwheels, the area of paddy fields was expanded by more than 400,000 mu, which is a major feature of this year's production. The seedlings in the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts are growing very well, already one and a half to two feet tall. Only in northern Chahar and Hebei-Chahar were crops planted after June 20 due to drought. Suiyuan Province has six complete counties and four border counties. In order to stabilize the production mood of the masses, the leadership transferred considerable armed forces to suppress bandits; and transferred cadres to the countryside to mobilize, publicize, and appropriately adjust land, which stimulated the peasants' enthusiasm for production and enabled the year's production plan to be roughly completed. In the 19 counties of the Taiyuan area, due to the recent heavy support-the-front tasks and the destruction by the Chiang-Yan bandit gangs, there were more than 1.5 million mu of wasteland and a severe shortage of draught animals. This spring, the leadership proposed that production for disaster relief be the main task in the area. The government has successively loaned out more than 200,000 jin of grain, so that the general public has been spared from freezing and starvation, and 50 villages have been able to use the disaster relief grain for production due to the leadership of special county cadres in the countryside. After the land reform, the peasants have a very high enthusiasm for production, and more than 140,000 mu of early-maturing crops have been planted.

    华北农业会议总结半年生产
    农业计划基本完成
    冀中播种棉花花生超过计划
    太行全力剿蝗救出大量青苗
    【本报特讯】华北农业生产会议自十二日揭幕后，速日由各行署农业处长报告各区今年农业生产概况，十四日各区报告结束，十五日由农业部副部长张冲同志作半年农业生产总结报告，详细地说明了水利、造林、繁畜、灭蝗、开荒、施肥等情形。十六日上午由华北财经委员会秘书长宋劭文同志向大会作报告，下午休会。预计会期尚有四、五日，十七日起改用小组形式讨论张副部长的总结报告、明年的生产计划和城市工业如何扶植农业生产等问题，然后再进行总结。从各区的报告看，华北今年上半年的农业生产计划，在各级党政机关的坚强领导和广大农民的努力下，战胜旱、虫、冻等灾害后，已基本上胜利完成。冀中区和冀南区是华北的主要棉产地，冀中区在小满节前没有下雨，春季作物仅在碱性湿地下种一部分，旱地大部未种，四月十日以后，全区开始全力和旱灾进行斗争。在克服了干部和群众“靠天吃饭”、“不用领导也照样生产”的思想障碍后，全区掀起了一个打井修渠挑水点种的热潮，结果种棉花三百二十余万亩，超过了原定三百万亩的计划；种花生一百九十万亩，超过原定计划四十万亩。据四十县统计，在突击播种中，共新挖土井十万多眼，打新砖井三千一百多眼，对完成今年的生产计划起了很大作用。现棉花已开花，谷子有一尺多高了，如不再发生水灾虫害等，今秋可望丰收。冀南区在谷雨前全区春旱，四月下旬便开始突击播种，全区男女老幼和干部一齐动员，这种情形在冀南还是空前的。经一月努力，共种棉花四百八十余万亩，完成原计划的百分之九十三点七。太行区有三分之一的地区，在六月初先后发生蝗蝻，领导上及时组织群众捕打，动员了九十余万人参加这一工作（四专区未统计在内），掀起了轰轰烈烈的剿蝗热潮。经十八天的紧张战斗后，蝗蝻基本上被消灭，救出了一百四十余万亩青苗。这是该区今年农业生产中的一大特点。长治左权山地春苗受灾较重，但补苗情形良好，平汉沿线青苗也长得不错。冀东区今年的播种工作，主要是在雨后抢种中完成的，共种棉花九十三万亩，略少于原来一百万亩的计划，花生的播种面积则超过了原计划的九十万亩。秋麦和春麦下种二百多万亩，超过了原计划。各地青苗已锄过二遍到三遍，情形良好。冀鲁豫区在五月底华北局和华北人民政府发出抗旱备荒的指示后，全区确定领导生产为压倒一切的工作。全区应种棉花一百五十万亩。据四十三县统计，已播种一百二十三万亩；大麻子已下种一千五百零五万株，如每株收四两，预计可超过原定计划。察哈尔省今年曾普遍发生牛瘟，受害区有二十县，仅平西涞水，雁北灵邱就死亡五千多头，对今春农业生产造成一大困难；幸及时防治，很快就把牛瘟扑灭了。该区今春共植树五百九十五万株，超过了原计划数；新修和补修旧渠七百八十三道；连同打井增购水车等，共扩大水田四十余万亩，这是今年生产中的一大特点。三、四、五分区青苗长得很好，已有一尺半到二尺高，仅察北和冀察因天旱，到六月二十日后才种上。绥远省有六个完整县，四个边缘县，领导上为安定群众生产情绪，曾抽调相当武装力量，从事剿灭土匪；并调配干部下乡，动员宣传和适当地调剂土地，农民的生产积极性才被启发起来，使今年的生产计划得以大致完成。太原区十九县，因巨大支前任务刚过去，和蒋阎匪帮的摧残破坏，荒地有一百五十多万亩，耕畜严重缺乏。今春领导上便提出以生产救灾为该区主要工作，政府曾先后贷出粮二十多万斤，使一般群众免于冻饿，并有五十个村因专县干部下乡领导，能将救灾粮用到生产上去。农民经过土改后，生产情绪甚高，已下种早熟作物十四万余亩。
