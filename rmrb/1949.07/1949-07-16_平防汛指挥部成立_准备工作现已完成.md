    Ping Anti-Flood Headquarters Established
    Preparations Now Complete
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Beijing Anti-Flood Headquarters was established on July 7th at Lugou Bridge. It is jointly composed of the Municipal Party Committee's Suburban Committee, the Municipal Government's Suburban Committee, the Construction Bureau, and relevant districts. It is responsible for directing and leading the farmers in the suburban areas along the Yongding River to participate in flood control work. Sub-headquarters have been established in Changxindian District, Shijingshan District, and Tongzhou District. After the headquarters was established, special personnel were dispatched to inspect the river embankments along the coast, organize emergency rescue teams in the villages along the coast, and prepare emergency rescue materials. Under the leadership of the headquarters, more than 600 laborers have completed various necessary preparations after a week of effort, including completing a 18-meter-long permeable dam and a 500-meter-long sub-dike south of Changxindian. Near Lugou Bridge, 1,300 sacks have been prepared and filled with mud, and their positions have been arranged. The dangerous dikes 298 meters downstream and over 100 meters upstream of the Stone Bridge (i.e., Lugou Bridge) have been repaired. Wire cages were woven and filled with stones and cement to block the wave nests in the overflow dike on the west bank of the Lugou River downstream. Shijingshan District has also prepared 1,000 cubic meters of earth and Changxindian District has also prepared 1,700 cubic meters.
