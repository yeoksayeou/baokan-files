Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th. American businessman Gold, the editor-in-chief and general manager of the Da Mei Evening Post in Shanghai, not only refused to reasonably adjust wages and unilaterally announced the suspension of publication, but also colluded with his wife, Tao Leshan, on the first of this month to beat and insult the newspaper's employee representatives, injuring four people, constituting a criminal act. Upon hearing this, newspaper employees and citizens throughout the city were extremely indignant and lodged serious protests. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau handled the matter according to the law, and Gold has admitted his mistakes, published an apology in the newspaper, and guaranteed that similar incidents will not occur in the future. It is reported that after Gold unilaterally announced the suspension of publication on June 23 and refused to adjust the wages of the newspaper's employees, he then conspired to buy off and divide the newspaper's employees. On one hand, Gold personally sent a letter to the employees, claiming to "donate" one hundred shi of rice to everyone, attempting to use this small favor to paralyze the employees and dispel their reasonable wage adjustment demands. On the other hand, he paid salaries to the nine employees of the editorial department who had already been ordered to leave the newspaper, and specially increased their base salary by 20 percent, attempting to use this to sow discord among the employees. The newspaper's employees ignored this and demanded that Gold resolve the wage issue reasonably according to the law. On July 1, the employees sent six representatives to Gold's residence to demand the owed salaries, but they were kicked and grabbed by Gold's wife, Tao Leshan. Gold also ran out barefoot and punched the employees, causing injuries to employees Zhang Ziqi, Yao Xiaokui, Ding Jinfa, and Sun Daobao. Afterwards, the four injured employees went to Renji Hospital for examination, and Dr. Wang Meixian confirmed the injuries to be true, and filed a complaint with the Huangpu Public Security Branch. Upon hearing this, newspaper employees throughout the city were extremely indignant and lodged serious protests. The Huangpu Public Security Branch notified Gold to go to the bureau for handling. Gold initially refused to go and tried to evade responsibility, saying, "It was my wife's doing." Later, after the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau formally summoned him, Gold went to the bureau on the 2nd to be interrogated. After the interrogation, the bureau decided to give lenient treatment considering that Gold was a first-time offender, and ordered Gold to apologize to the beaten workers in person and in the newspaper, and to guarantee that similar incidents would not occur again. Gold expressed acceptance of this lenient treatment by the People's Government, and personally wrote an apology notice, which was published in the Liberation Daily and the English-language North-China Daily News on the 3rd. On the morning of the 4th, he personally apologized to the injured workers in person. The full text of Gold's apology notice is as follows: "Gold's Apology Notice: On July 1, the workers of the Da Mei Evening Post came to my residence to negotiate wage matters. I injured four workers. Now I hereby apologize to the injured workers and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again."

　　沪美商大美晚报总经理高尔德竟打伤职工代表
  　市公安局依法处理
    高尔德已向工人认错并登报道歉
    【新华社上海六日电】美商大美晚报主笔兼总经理高尔德在拒绝合理调整工资，并自行宣布停刊之后，竟又于本月一日与其妻子陶乐珊合伙殴辱该报职工代表，打伤四人，造成犯罪行为。全市报界职工和市民闻讯，十分愤激，纷纷提出严重抗议，当经沪市公安局依法处理，高尔德已承认错误，登报道歉，保证以后不发生同类事件。按高尔德于六月二十三日自行宣布停刊，拒绝调整该报职工工资后，继又阴谋对该报职工施行收买分化。高曾一面亲自送了一封信给职工，扬言要拿出一百石食米“赠予”大家，妄图以此小惠麻痹职工，打消职工的合理调整工资要求；一面又给已经被他命令离开报馆的编辑部九个职员发薪资，并特别增加底薪百分之二十，企图借此离间职工团结。该报职工皆未予置理，要求高尔德依法合理解决工资问题。七月一日职工推派代表六人至高寓所索取积欠薪资，当被高妻陶乐珊脚踢手抓，高亦赤脚奔出向职工挥拳，致有职工张子琦、姚筱魁、丁金法、孙道宝等四人受伤。事后，四位受伤职工即往仁济医院验伤，经医师汪梅先验伤属实，即向黄浦公安分局提起控诉。全市报界职工闻讯后，无不激愤异常，纷纷提出严重抗议，黄浦公安分局当通知高尔德去局处理。高初拒绝前往，并图狡赖，推委说：“是我女人的事。”后经沪市公安局正式传讯，高乃于二日到局受讯。经讯问后，该局当决定，姑念高系初犯，从轻发落，由高尔德向被打工人当面及登报道歉，并保证以后再不发生同样事件。高尔德对人民政府这种宽大处理办法表示接受，亲笔写出道歉启事，于三日刊载解放日报及英文字林西报，并于四日上午亲自向受伤工人当面道歉。高尔德道歉启事全文如下：“高尔德道歉启事：七月一日大美晚报的工人到我的寓所来协议工资事宜，我打伤了四个工人，现在我谨向受伤工人道歉，并保证以后不再发生同样事件。”
