Look,—look steadily,
    These ancient city's faded gray old palace walls,
    How dim,
    How old,
    Early revealing the feudal old forces' declining scene.
    But, look again:—look up,
    Within these faded old walls
    A dazzling red light is shooting high!
    Red flags—fluttering in the wind;
    Red stars—shining brightly;
    Large banners with red background and white characters
    Hang high in the bright and open hall.
    Here, in the red July season,
    Is joyfully opening an unprecedented national literary and art congress.
    More than six hundred—men, women, old, and young
    Who can write, who can sing,
    Who can dance, who can perform,
    Who can direct, who can compose,
    Who can speak, who have acrobatic skills,
    Who can paint, sculpt,
    Who can translate various languages!
    …………………
    All kinds of literary and art workers,
    They are like torrents,
    From all directions
    Gathering together.
    Under the same call;
    In the same hope;
    On the same belief,
    They are enthusiastically and vividly
    Striving to cultivate, plant, irrigate, and nurture
    In the vast field of literature and art,
    Preparing spiritual
    Food for this unprecedented new era.
    Naturally,
    It is nourishing and toxin-free grain of rice,——
    For the masses to eat their fill,
    To increase physical strength and enhance new ideas!
    They:
    Eagerly discuss;
    Meticulously analyze;
    Report the work experience of literature and art by region and area,
    Mutually encourage each other, telling their hopes and propositions.
    How to select things from the past era;
    How to sort out;
    How to put new wine in old bottles;
    How to discard the useless;
    How to carry forward the essence.
    How to create current things;
    How to recognize;
    How to capture from real life;
    How to use words, sounds, colors, dynamics
    And all kinds of artistic tricks,
    To channel the emotions of the masses into the right path,
    To refine the consciousness of the masses to be healthier and clearer.
    Some have pens and tongues;
    Knives and hands;
    Silvery screen images;
    Silk and bamboo music;
    Those various literary and artistic weapons, for the future of new democracy—
    To open up wasteland;
    To cut through thorns and brambles,
    Open up a straight road for everyone to join hands,
    Singing loudly, cheering;
    To encourage forward
    An orderly team.
    Literature and art are no longer the delicate playthings
    On the desks of so-called "literati and scholars";
    Nor are they treasures in one's own "ivory tower."
    That one—no matter if he is a worker, peasant, soldier, or scholar
    Who doesn't have a little bit of literary and artistic interest?
    Who doesn't have a little bit of artistic proposition?
    Methods and forms are varied,
    But, serving the people;
    Promoting the times;
    Spreading enthusiasm;
    Broadcasting knowledge;
    Contributing a bit of supplementary strength to popular education!
    At the same time, every worker
    Also learns from diligent work
    The proper way to educate oneself.
    However, the most fundamental thing is to first firmly establish that
    Thought of the same goal!
    Simply put:
    That is, relying on all kinds of literary and artistic tricks,
    To enrich and portray a model of a new society.
    Coordinating with the epoch-making great changes in politics and economy,
    Using pens and tongues,
    Knives and hands,
    Silvery screen images;
    Silk and bamboo music, etc.,
    To truly add the power of silent transformation,
    To truly point out the direction that should be moved forward!
    Now—
    The field of literature and art is so expanded;
    Literary and artistic weapons are new and old in many ways.
    What's more—
    There is timely wind and rain to urge moistening,
    There is fertile and fast-growing soil.
    Only in this way can new buds grow rapidly
    Only in this way can a hundred flowers bloom!
    Everyone works together,
    With a hoe, a mattock, a hand,
    Don't waste such a suitable time for planting and cultivating!
    Red flags—fluttering in the wind;
    Red stars—shining brightly.
    Working together with one heart and unlimited strength,
    Doing things for others and for oneself is no different.
    Men, women, old, and young gather together,
    Talking and discussing to seek appropriateness.
    You think—you think carefully in a further, deeper, and wider place,
    Is this a gathering that has ever happened before?
    Is this a place where everyone could talk before?
    Without Marxism-Leninism as guidance,
    Without the Chinese people fighting,
    How could everyone have this unprecedented venue for the Literary and Art Congress!
    Cherished this hope for many years,
    Ashamed that my temples are empty and gray,
    Now the hope has finally been realized,
    New and old friends gather in the same hall.
    A new poem should be sung in chorus,
    Everyone joins hands and moves forward,
    Each relying on their own ability without pushing back,
    Dividing the work and cooperating in the same direction.
    You look—
    Red flags, red stars, there are dazzling brilliance everywhere to attract you!
    Morning of July 11, 1949

    文代大会颂
    王统照
    你看，—你平看，
    这古城褪了色的灰旧宫墙，
    多末黯淡，
    多末陈旧，
    早显出封建的旧力已经没落的景象。
    可是，你再看：—你仰头看，
    这片褪色的旧墙里
    却正高射出赫耀红光！
    红的旗—迎风招展；
    红的星—闪着光芒；
    红底白字的大布幅
    高悬于明敞的厅厢。
    这儿，正在红七月的时候
    欢开着空前的全国文代的会场。
    六百多位——男、女、老、少
    会写，会唱，
    会舞蹈，会表演，
    会编导，会作曲，
    会谈说，会曲技，
    会绘画，雕塑，
    会各国文字的传译！
    …………………
    各种各样的文艺工作者，
    他们象激流似的，
    从四面八方
    来聚一堂。
    在同一的号召下；
    在同一的希望中；
    在同一的信念上，
    他们热烈生动的
    正在努力向文艺的广大的田园里
    开垦，种植，浇灌，培养，
    为这个空前的新时代预备下精神
    的食粮。
    自然，
    是富于滋养毫无毒素的粒粒粮米，——
    是为大众饱餐后，
    好增加体力，提高新思想！
    他们：
    热切的讨论；
    细密的分析；
    分地分区的报告出文艺的工作经验，
    互相期勉的告诉出各人的希望主张。
    过去时代的东西怎样检选；
    怎样整理；
    怎样的把旧瓶装新酿；
    怎样把无用的抛弃；
    怎样把精华发扬。
    当前的东西怎样创造；
    怎样认识；
    怎样从真实生活中摄取；
    怎样用文字，声音，色彩，动
    态以及各式各种艺术把戏，
    把大众的情感纳入正途，
    把大众的意识提炼得更为健康更
    清晰。
    有的是笔与舌；
    刀与手；
    银光的幕影；
    丝竹的弹奏；
    那若干样文艺的利器，为新民主的前途——
    拓土开荒；
    斩荆披棘，
    开辟出一条平直大路好共仝携手，
    高唱，欢呼；
    好鼓舞向前
    整齐队伍。
    文艺再不是所谓“文人学士”
    案头上的小巧玩艺；
    更不是“象牙塔”里自己的宝物。
    那一个人—不论他是工，农，兵，士
    谁没有一点点的文艺兴趣？
    谁没有一点点的艺术主张？
    方法，形式尽管多多样，
    但，为民众服务；
    为时代推动；
    为热情传布；
    为知识播扬；
    为普及的教育尽一分补助的力量！
    同时，每个工作者
    从勤劳工作里也获得学习人家
    教育自个的当。
    然而，最根本的却先要坚定住那
    同一目标的思想！
    简捷点说：
    就是凭着各式各种的文艺把戏，
    充实出，刻画出一个新社会的榜
    样。
    配合着政治，经济上划时代的大
    变动，
    借用笔与舌，
    刀与手，
    银光的幕影；
    丝竹的弹奏等等，
    实实在在的增添默化暗移的力能
    ，
    实实在在的指明应该前进的方向！
    于今—
    文艺的田园多么扩大；
    文艺的利器新旧多方。
    何况—
    有及时的风雨催润，
    有肥厚快长的土壤。
    这样才能够新芽争长
    这样才能够百花齐放！
    大家齐用力，
    一铣，一锄，一手掌，
    莫辜负这样合式的种植培养的时光！
    红的旗—迎风招展；
    红的星—闪着光芒。
    同心并力无限量，
    为人为己没两样。
    男女，老少聚一堂，
    谈说商讨求洽当。
    你想—你向更远，更深，更广处
    仔细推想，
    这可是以前曾有过的聚会？
    这可是以前大家能会谈的地方？
    若无马列主义作领导，
    若无中国人民来争斗，
    大家怎能有这次空前的文代大会
    的会场！
    若干年来存此望，
    自愧两鬓空苍苍，
    于今希望竟实现，
    新知旧友共同堂。
    一首新诗当合唱，
    大家携手往前方，
    各凭本事无推让，
    分工合作同方向。
    你且看——
    红的旗，红的星，到处有招引你
    的显耀辉光！
    一九四九年七月十一日晨
