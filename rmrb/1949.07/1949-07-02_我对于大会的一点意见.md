　　My Opinion on the Congress
　　Cao Yu
　　In this congress, the friends from all over are workers with experience and achievements in their own work posts. Some have carried out years of struggle in rural areas and the army, and some have engaged in literary and artistic activities in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas to fight for democracy. In delving into the lives of the working class and peasants, many advanced literary and art workers, after an arduous transformation process, have grasped the viewpoint of the masses; some people, limited by objective facts, have not yet been able to obtain this correct position. The work areas are different, and everyone’s work is also different. Everyone has their own strengths, and may also have their own weaknesses. But we all have a lot of valuable experience and abilities.

　　We are united under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of New Democracy. This is our principle.

　　Future literary and artistic criticism and activities must be developed according to this principle. We must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, study and understand the relationship between New Democracy and the future literary and artistic line. To transform ourselves ideologically, to use the power of literature and art according to principles, to serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, and to serve the cultural construction of New China, this is the topic that each of us should answer.

　　However, the first thing is unity. Naturally, we must be educated in the life of the masses, but as a start, we need to obtain preliminary unity in this national congress of literary and art cadres. Unity requires everyone to understand each other, to recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses in ideology and work. Due to the different history, environment, and experience of each person, everyone may have some differences in how to devote themselves to the mass literature and art of the New Democratic stage. As long as we avoid the work style of departmentalism and empiricism, understand the objective situation without cutting off history, we will understand that the progress of thought may be a difference in degree for us today. As long as the differing viewpoints do not violate principles and do not remain at the current stage, they will enrich the review and development of literature and art, which will be beneficial to the popularization and improvement of literature and art that serves the workers, peasants and soldiers.

　　Learn from each other seriously and deeply, educate each other, on one hand being tireless in teaching, and on the other hand being insatiable in learning. Constantly examine ourselves, encourage others, to ensure the progress of the whole, and solve the literary and artistic requirements of objective reality. There must be struggle in our unity, and there must be unity in struggle. In continuous correct criticism and self-criticism, we should maintain a sincere and humble attitude. With this attitude, we will recognize that we all may have some shortcomings, but we absolutely all have some strengths. Because today, everyone has taken out the best part to promote this unprecedented great unity of Chinese national literary and art workers.

### 我对于大会的一点意见

　　我对于大会的一点意见
    曹禺
    这次大会中，来自各地的朋友们都是在自己的工作岗位上有经验与成绩的工作者。有的在农村与部队里进行多年的斗争，有的为争取民主在蒋匪区从事文艺活动。在深入工农群众的生活中，多少文艺的先进，经过艰苦的改造过程，已经掌握住了群众的观点；有些人，限于客观事实，还不能获得这正确的立场。工作区域各自不同，各人的业务也不一样。大家都各有所长，也可能各有所短。但是我们都有不少宝贵的经验与能力。
    我们是在毛泽东思想领导与新民主主义旗帜之下团结起来的。这是我们的原则。
    今后的文艺批评与文艺活动必须根据这个原则发展。我们要努力学习毛泽东思想，研究，认识新民主主义与今后文艺路线的关系。从思想上改造自己，根据原则发挥文艺的力量，为工农兵服务，为新中国文化建设服务，这是我们每个人应该解答的课题。
    然而首先却是团结。自然我们必须在群众生活中得到教育，但作为开始，更需要在这次全国文艺干部的大会里获得初步的团结。团结需要大家互相了解，互相认识彼此在思想上与业务上的短长。由于各人的历史、环境与经验的不同，大家对于如何致力于新民主主义阶段的群众文艺的作法可能有些岐异。我们只要避开本位主义与经验主义的作风，了解客观情况而不隔断历史，便会明白思想的进步，在今日的我们可能是程度上的差别。参差的观点只要不违背原则，不停留于眼前的阶段，将会充实丰富文学艺术的检讨与发展，是有益于普及与提高为工农兵服务的文学艺术的。
    严肃而深入地互相学习，互相教育，一面是诲人不倦，一面是学而不厌。时时刻刻检查自己，勉励别人，来保证全体的进步，解决客观现实的文艺要求。我们的团结里必须有斗争，斗争中必须有团结。在不断地正确批评与自我批评中，我们应该保持诚恳与谦虚的态度。有了这种态度，才会认清我们大家可能都有些缺点，却绝对地都有些长处。因为在今日，每个人都是拿出了最优良的一部份，来促成这史无前例的中华全国文学艺术工作者的大团结。
