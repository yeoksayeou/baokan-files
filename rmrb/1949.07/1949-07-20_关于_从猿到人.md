On "From Ape to Man"
	Hu Qingjun
In the study of the history of social development, "from ape to man" is an important starting point. Since Darwin first created the theory of biological evolution, it has been scientifically and strongly demonstrated how single-celled organisms gradually evolved into humans. More than seventy years ago, Engels' "The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man" provided us with excellent theoretical guidance. In the last two or three decades, anthropological discoveries of fossil skeletons of ancient and modern human races, as well as knowledge from physical and skeletal measurement studies of various races today, have further solved the question of how to "from ape to man." This scientific historical fact fundamentally negates the myth of "God creating man," which has dominated Europe since Christianity, and also negates many strange and bizarre flood legends of various ethnic groups around the world. However, even today, this scientific fact is often distorted by ambitious individuals and ignored by those who live by prejudice, so that many people still harbor doubts, and even consider it an unimaginable question.

For example, bourgeois scholars employed by European and American imperialist fascists, in order to fabricate and promote ideas of racial inequality, often like to use the depth of skin color to determine the superiority or inferiority of racial qualities. Under the influence of this fallacy, people in Northern Europe look down on people in Southern Europe, and white people look down on yellow people. Those blond, blue-eyed Nordic people, since they can admire themselves and consider themselves "Heaven's chosen," can point at the black people who are the same color as the bottom of a pot and shout loudly: "Black people are beasts!" Similarly, in China, the main ethnic group from the central region, such as the Han people, often likes to use the phrase "If they are not of our race, their hearts must be different!" when looking at minority ethnic groups, and even add insect or beast radicals to characters like 狄, ＠, and 蛮 to call these ethnic groups. Dividing the various ethnic groups of the world into those not from a single origin, or forming unequal views, is the "theoretical" weapon of arrogant imperialist bourgeois governments in invading colonial weak ethnic groups and reactionary Han chauvinists in deceiving minority ethnic groups. Since they believe that there is a hierarchy of races, and that the hierarchy of races is based on different origins, the idea of apes turning into humans is hardly pleasing to these gentlemen. In the American Museum of Natural History, there is a display of animals like gorillas, and we can often hear the following comments from visitors: "I absolutely do not believe that I am a descendant of this ugly Bajie ape-man!"

However, the facts of evolution completely negate this "self-righteous" idea. Humans did indeed evolve from apes. These apes can be collectively referred to as primates, which can generally be divided into three branches: 1. Lemuroidea, produced in Africa. 2. Tarsiioidea, produced in the East Indies. 3. Anthropoidea, produced all over the world. Anthropoidea can be divided into three suborders: 1. Old World monkeys, 2. New World monkeys, 3. Anthropoid apes. Anthropoid apes include gibbons, orangutans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. In terms of the degree of evolution, anthropoid apes are most similar to humans. Comparative anatomy can prove that humans and anthropoid apes have similar body structures. Although the proportions of various parts of the body are not the same, such as the arms of anthropoid apes being long and the legs being short, mostly in line with the Chinese physiognomy book's "hands passing the knees," while humans are the opposite, and it is difficult to see this "noble appearance"! The skeletons, teeth, muscles, and internal organs of anthropoid apes are completely similar to those of humans. Even their brains are almost the same as human brains, but smaller in scale. Embryonic development, male and female reproductive organs, sexual behavior, and reactions to various diseases and drugs are all completely similar between anthropoid apes and humans. For example, in museum displays, gorillas and chimpanzees are very susceptible to pneumonia and influenza. All of this proves that anthropoid apes are close relatives of humans in terms of bloodline.

People may ask: Are these anthropoid apes the ancestors of humans? In other words: Can orangutans turn into humans? If not, what is the relationship between orangutans and humans?

Our answer is: Modern anthropoid apes can no longer turn into humans. At least scientifically, we have not found any such transformation. The reason they cannot turn into humans is that they no longer have the conditions to transform, or to put it more clearly: their physical constitution does not contain factors that may lead to transformation. We should understand that these anthropoid apes have been fixed as apes. They are not the direct ancestors of humans, but rather the cousins of humans. They and humans have a common ancestor.

This common ancestor is naturally still a type of ape. This ape can be traced back to Dryopithecus or Forest Ape, which were distributed in Europe, Asia, and Africa, from Spain to India. However, they are now extinct. We can only look for them in the geological history. From one million to fifteen million years ago, approximately during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs of the Tertiary period in geological history, was their era of activity and reproduction.

This type of ape originally had a more agile physique and lived in trees. They climbed and leaped among the trees, eating fruits, bird eggs, leaves, and tender branches. However, their weight increased day by day, becoming similar to or even exceeding the weight of today's humans. Therefore, they began to feel the inconvenience of living in trees. Furthermore, because the things to eat in the trees became increasingly scarce, and sleeping in the trees also became inconvenient, they came down to the ground. After coming to the ground, in order to find food, they had to dig for grubs and other things under stones or trees, and catch earthworms and small animals. Therefore, they had to have free hands, which also made them have to stand up. Engels said:

	The hand is no longer the foot, and now in climbing it plays quite a different role. The ape slowly got used to walking upright on the flat ground, and this was the decisive step in the transition from ape to man.

	Our ancestors gradually learned to adapt their hands to some work during the hundreds of thousands of years of transition from ape to man, and this work could only be very simple at the beginning... The hand became free, able to constantly acquire new skills, and this acquired flexibility was inherited and increased generation after generation.

Engels continued to analyze that the hand is the product of labor, the specialization of the hand means tools, and tools mean human-specific activities, meaning human's transformative role on nature, meaning production. He said:

	Labor begins with the making of tools, and the oldest tools are hunting and fishing tools, which are also weapons. Hunting and fishing is the prerequisite for the transition from eating only plants to also eating meat, and this is an important step in the evolution to man. Meat food contains, in an almost complete state, the most important materials necessary for the body's metabolism; meat food shortens the time required for digestion and other nutritional processes compared to plant food, thus saving more time, more materials, and more energy to live a truly animal life. The farther this human being in formation is from the plant kingdom, the higher they rise above the animal kingdom.

Using both hands is the hallmark of mankind. The hand is the product of labor, and this constitutes the distinction between humans and apes. Based on labor, that is, based on the use of both hands after humans stood upright, the ape groups and humans formed later differences in their physical constitution. For example, the human thumb can freely oppose the other four fingers. This is one of the physical characteristics gradually produced in labor, and is also a very important point in the use of tools. In today's anthropoid apes, their thumbs are aligned with the other four fingers and cannot be opposed, so they cannot make and use tools. When they encounter enemies, they can only pat their chests or rush towards the opponent with courage, and there is no effective way to resist.

The development of language is also an important difference between ape groups and humans. In today's anthropoid apes, they can only make a dozen sounds to express emotions of joy and anger, and there is no systematic language. Regarding the origin of language, Engels also pointed out that it is the merit of labor:

	The development of labor necessarily led to a closer combination of the various members of society, and in this way, the situations of mutual help and cooperation increased, and the benefits of this cooperation were obvious to everyone. In short; these humans in formation had reached the point where they had to say something to each other. The need creates its own organs. The ape's underdeveloped throat, due to the constant increase in the intonation of tones, slowly but surely transformed, and the organs of the mouth gradually learned to continuously emit a clear syllable.

Due to labor and language leading to the development of the brain, Engels said:

	First of all, labor, then language along with labor, these two are the most important driving forces, under their influence, the ape's brain gradually became a human brain that is completely similar in basic structure but larger and more perfect.

The development of the human brain has also created a significant difference between today's humans and ape groups. The largest brain capacity in anthropoid apes, such as gorillas, is only 600CC, while the average human brain capacity is always between 1200-1400CC. In terms of the ratio of brain weight to body weight: the adult chimpanzee is one to seventy-five, while humans are only one to thirty-five to forty. The front of the human brain is particularly developed, and there are also many wrinkles on the brain, while anthropoid apes are far less evolved in these areas than humans. These are significant differences between humans and anthropoid apes.

We do not need to list all the physical differences between humans and anthropoid apes one by one, but one point that must be mentioned here is in terms of teeth. Human teeth and anthropoid ape teeth belong to the same type, and the number is also the same, but human canine teeth, compared with other teeth, are not as particularly large as those of anthropoid apes, nor are they higher than the plane of other teeth, nor do they extend outward. Secondly, the crown of the lower molars is not as sharp as a knife, and the place where it meets the upper canine teeth cannot cut food like scissors, while apes are the opposite. These are important differences between human teeth and anthropoid ape teeth. This difference often becomes an important basis for us to trace human ancestors and distinguish ape and human fossils.

From here, we can trace back to the separation of humans and apes. I said earlier: humans and today's anthropoid apes have a common ancestor, which can be traced back to the Miocene forest ape. From the forest ape evolved to the ancestor of the formal separation of humans and apes, that is, when one branch evolved into humans, probably about one million years ago, approximately at the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch to the end of the Pliocene epoch. However, the ancestor of humans and anthropoid apes at the time of separation, human anthropologists had been looking for in the stratum for many years, but they had never found it. Anthropologists called this the Missing Link, meaning a lost chain in the evolutionary process.

However, in recent years, new materials discovered in anthropology, some people believe that the missing link has been found. The story of this discovery is as follows: In 1924, in a place called Taungs in southern Africa, a human anthropologist named Professor R. Dart discovered the skull of a six-year-old child. In terms of the degree of evolution, the skull of this child was just between humans and anthropoid apes. Its appearance still looked like an ape, and humans may have evolved from it. Therefore, Dart called this child Australopithecus Africanus. Unfortunately, the age was too young to be definitive. In 1936, Dr. R. Broom discovered a skull, several skull fragments, and eight teeth in the vicinity of the same area. The shape was very similar to that of the six-year-old child in front. In 1937, two experts from the United States who specialized in the study of human teeth came to Africa to conduct joint research. The results of their research showed that this is a type of anthropoid ape related to chimpanzees and gorillas, but its teeth are different from anthropoid apes, and quite similar to the teeth of early humans. Therefore, they believed that Australopithecus should be close to the common ancestor of anthropoid apes and humans, and its degree of evolution was only slightly higher than that of the forest ape.

The world's human races can be roughly divided into three main branches: black, white, and yellow. Anthropologists believe that these three branches of humans have a single origin. However, where exactly is the earliest origin of humans? The general opinion is concentrated in the Central Asia area. In 1911, Dr. W.D. Matthew made the following assumption:

	The general opinion now is that the origin of the most ancient humans may be on the great plains of Central Asia. In this region, today it is desolate and barren, with few people living there. But it may be the site of the remains of the most ancient culture we have collected today. Surrounding this area are the oldest cultural areas on record, west to Chaldea, Asia Minor, and Egypt, south to India, and east to China...

Matthew's assumption has been proven by the successive discoveries of fossil skeletons of ancient human races. This ancient human race began with the discovery of Java Erect Ape-man (Pithecanthropus erectus) in 1891-1892. After 1928, the successive excavation of fossil remains of Peking Man, and the discovery of the ancient Java giant (Meganthropus Palaeojavanicus) in 1941, these human bone fossils proved that the underground of Asia buried ancient human races that have not yet been discovered in Europe today. Their age is probably between 500,000 and 1 million years ago. From the degree of evolution, the ancient Java giant is probably the earliest and most primitive, followed by the Java Erect Ape-man, and finally Peking Man, but these three types of bones are extremely similar to each other, which can prove that they are of the same lineage. These ancient human races, as of today, can be said to be the first batch after the separation of humans and anthropoid apes, and also the earliest human races discovered today.

Opposite to the ancient human race is the modern human race (Homo Sapilim). This type of modern human evolved from the ancient human race, but their physical characteristics are quite different from the ancient human race. For example, the ancient human race has an inconspicuous chin, a very protruding jaw, a flat and sunken nose, prominent brow ridges, and a low and short forehead. The appearance is not very good-looking, and modern humans generally do not have this problem. The history of modern humans was previously thought to be only 20,000 years, but due to the discovery of the Charenteman in southern France in August 1946, the age has been pushed back to more than 100,000 years ago. These modern human races, plus a number of ancient fossil humans successively discovered in Europe from 50,000 to 300,000-400,000 years ago, plus the ancient Asian human races listed above, form a connecting line, which can be connected to the African ape-man and the forest ape, and can reconstruct a history of how to "from ape to man."

    关于“从猿到人”
    胡庆均
    在社会发展史的研究上，“从猿到人”是一个重要的起点。自从达尔文首创生物演化的理论以来，已经把单细胞生物如何逐渐演变成人，从科学上得到了坚强的论证。远在七十多年以前，恩格斯的“劳动在从猿到人过程中的作用”，又给了我们一个很好的理论上的指导。近二三十年来，人类学上关于古人种及今人种的化石骨骼的发现，以及对于今日各种族的身体与骨骼测量研究的知识，更进一步解决了如何“从猿到人”的问题。这一件科学的史实，它根本否定了自基督教统治欧洲以来所谓“上帝造人”的神话，也否定了全世界各民族中许多希奇古怪的洪荒传说。然而一直到今天，这一件科学的事实还常被野心家所歪曲，被靠成见生活的人所漠视，以致在许多人的心目中还存在许多怀疑，甚至认为是不能想象的问题。
    例如欧美帝国主义法西斯主义御用的资产阶级学者为要捏造和宣传种族不平等思想，常常喜欢用肤色的深浅来断定种族品质的高下。在这个谬论的影响之下，使得北欧人瞧不起南欧人，白种人瞧不起黄种人，那些黄发蓝睛的北欧诺的克（Ｎｏｒｄｉｃ）人，既然可以顾影自诩，自命为“天之骄之”，他们就可以指着那些与锅底同色的黑人大肆叫嚣：“黑人是兽类！”又如在中国，来自中央区域的主要民族好比汉族的看待少数民族，就常喜欢用“非我族类，其心必异！”的词句，甚至加上了虫兽偏旁好象狄、＠、蛮等一类字来称呼这些民族。把全世界的各种族分割为不自一个来源，或者形成差等的看法，是狂妄的帝国主义资产阶级政府侵略殖民地弱小民族和反动的大汉族主义者欺骗少数民族的“理论”武器。既然认为人种有高下，人种的高下是基于来源的不同，猿猴变人的说法就很难得为这些先生们所乐闻。在美国自然历史博物院中，有一处陈列着大猩猩一类的动物，我们常可从参观者口中听到下述的评语：“我决不相信我是这丑八戒人猿的子孙！”
    然而演化的事实完全否定了这种“自鸣清高”的想法，人的确是从猿猴演变而来。这种猿猴可以统称为灵长类，通常可以分为三支：一、狐猴科（Ｌｅｍｕｒｏｉｄｅａ），产于非洲。二、眼镜猴科（Ｔａｒｓｉｏｉｄｅａ），产于东印度。三、人猿科（Ａｎｔｈｒｏｐｏｉｄｅａ），产于世界各地。人猿科又可分成三目，一、旧大陆猴，二、新大陆猴，三、类人猿（Ａｎｔｈｒｏｐｏｉｄ  Ａｐｅ）。类人猿中又包括长臂猿、猩猩、黑猩猩、大猩猩四大支。在演化的程度上，类人猿与人最相近似。从比较解剖学就可以证明：人与类人猿的躯体有相似的模式。虽然在身体各部的比例上不大相同，好比类人猿的臂长腿短，大都合乎中国相书上的“两手过膝”，而人倒适得其反，很难见到这种“贵相”！类人猿的骨骼、牙齿、肌肉，以及内脏的解剖，完全与人相似。以至他们的脑子，几乎与人脑一样，只不过是具体而微罢了。胚胎的发展，男女性生殖器官，性生活的表现，对于各种疾病以及药品的反应，所有的类人猿与人都完全相似。好比在博物陈列馆的饲养中，大猩猩与黑猩猩极易患肺炎与流行性感冒。所有这些，都可证明类人猿是人类血统上的近亲。
    人们也许要问：这种类人猿是不是人类的祖先？换一句话说：猩猩是不是可以变成人？如果不可能，猩猩和人有什么姻娅关系？
    我们的回答是：现在的类人猿已经不能再变成人，至少在科学上，我们没有这种类人猿变人的发现。他们之所以不能变成人，是因为他们没有了变人的条件，或者更明确点说：是他们的体质上没有孕育着可能变成人的因素。我们应当明了的是：这种类人猿已经定型成为猿类，他们不是人类的直系祖先，而是人类的堂兄弟，他们和人有着共同的祖先。
    这共同的祖先自然还是一种猿类，这种猿类可以一直上溯到森林无尾猿（Ｄｒｙｏｐ  ｔｈｅｃｕｓ  ｏｒ  Ｆｏｒｅｓｔ  Ａｐｅ），他们分布在欧洲、亚洲和菲洲，由西班牙至印度一带。可是他们今天已经绝迹于世上，我们只能在地史上去追寻。距今一百万至一千五百万年前，约当地史上第三纪中的中新世（Ｍｉｏｃｅｎｅ）及鲜新世（Ｐｌｉｏｃｅｎｅ），是他们活动与繁殖的时代。
    这一种猿类本来体格较矫，栖居于树上，他们在树间攀援跳跃，食着树上的果实、鸟卵、树叶和嫩枝，可是后来体重一天比一天增加，与今人不相上下，甚至渐渐超过了今天人的体重，于是他们开始感到栖树的不便。更由于树上可吃的东西日渐稀少，在树上睡觉也感到不大方便，于是他们便下了地来。下地来之后，为了寻找食物，就得在石头或者树木下面挖掘蛴螬一类的东西，并捕捉虫蚓以及一些小动物，于是他们就必得有自由的双手，这样也使得他们必须站起来。恩格斯说：
    在攀援时手起的作用与脚不同，这一猿类开始摆脱用手在平地上行走的习惯，而渐渐地采用了直立的行走，这就是从猿到人的有决定意义的第一步。
    我们的祖先在从猿转变到人的好几十万年的过程中逐渐地学会了使自己的手适应于一些工作，而这些工作在开始时只能是非常简单的…手变得自由了，能够不断的获得新的技巧，而这样获得的灵活性便遗传下来，一代一代地增加着。
    恩格斯继续分析手是劳动的产物，手的专门化是意味着工具，而工具是意味着人的特有的活动，意味着人对自然的有改造意义的作用，意味着生产。他说：
    劳动是同制造工具一起开始的，最古的工具是打猎和捕鱼的工具，而同时又是武器。打猎和捕鱼是从只吃植物转变到同时也吃肉的前提，而这又是进化到人的重要的一步。肉类食物在差不多完备的状态下包含着为身体新陈代谢所必需的最重要的材料；肉类食物较之植物食物缩短了消化过程以及其他营养过程所必需的时间，因此省下了更多的时间，更多的材料和更多的精力来过真正动物的生活。这种在形成中的人离植物界愈远，他们超出于动物界也就愈高。
    使用双手就是人类的表征，手是劳动的产物，从这里也就构成了人和猿类的区别。基于劳动，也就是基于人类直立后双手的使用，也使得猿群与人类在体质上形成了后来的差异。这差异好比人的大姆指能够与其他四个小指自由相对，这是由于劳动中逐渐产生的体质特征之一，也是使用工具中很重要的一点。在今天的类人猿中，他们的大姆指就与其他四指并排而不能相对，因此他们就不能够制造和使用工具。当他们遇到敌人时，只能拍拍胸膛，或者凭一股勇气向来人扑去，并没有有效的抵抗办法。
    语言的发达也是划分猿群与人类的重要差异之一。在今天的类人猿中，他们只能发出十几种声音，来表示喜怒的情绪，而没有系统的语言。关于语言的产生，恩格斯也指出是劳动的功绩：
    劳动底发达必然使得各个社会成员更紧密地互相结合起来，而且这样一来，互相帮助和共同协作底情形就增多了，这种共同协作底好处对于每一个人就一目了然了。简单地说；这些在形成中的人已经到了彼此间有什么东西非说不可了。需要产生着自己的器官。猿类不发达的喉管，由于音调抑扬顿挫之不断加多，缓慢地然而一定不移地改造起来了，而口部底器官也逐渐学会了连续发出一个清晰的音节。
    由于劳动和语言引到了脑髓的发达，恩格斯说：
    首先是劳动，然后是同劳动一起产生的语言，这两者乃是最主要的推动力，在它们的影响下，猿的脑髓才逐渐变成在基本构造上完全相类似但较大和较完善的人的脑髓。
    人类脑髓的发达在今天也和猿群发生了显著的差别，类人猿中最大的脑容量如大猩猩不过六○○ＣＣ，而人类普通的脑容量总在一二○○—一四○○ＣＣ。以脑重和体重的比例来说：成年的黑猩猩为一比七五，而人只有一比三五—四十。人脑的前部特别发达，脑上的皱纹也特别多，而类人猿在这些地方的进化程度远不如人，这些都是人和类人猿显著不同的特点。
    人类与类人猿许多体形上的差异我们用不着一一举列，但这里必须提出的一点是在牙齿方面。人类的牙齿与类人猿的牙齿同属一型，数目也相同，但人类的犬牙与其他的牙齿相比，不象类人猿那样特别大，并且也不高出于其他齿平线，也不向外伸张。其次，下臼牙的齿冠不象刀口似的锐利，与上面的犬牙相会合的地方，不能象剪刀似的剪切食物，而猿类适得其反。这些都是人齿和类人猿牙齿的重要差别，这一点差别也常常成为我们追踪人类的祖先，区别猿和人的化石的重要根据。
    从这里我们就可以追溯到人和猿类的分家了，我在前面说过：人和今天的类人猿有着共同的祖先，这祖先可以追溯到中新世的森林无尾猿，从森林无尾猿演化到人和猿正式分家时的老祖，也就是其中有一支演变成人的时候，大概在距今一百万年前，约当洪积期（Ｐｅｉ  ｔｏｃｅｎｅ）初到鲜新期末的时候。可是正当分家时人和类人猿的老祖，过去人类学家在地层里面找了多少年，始终没有发现，人类学家把这个叫做Ｍｉｓｓｉｎｇ  Ｌｉｎｋ，意思是在演化过程中一个失去了的连锁。
    可是近些年来人类学上新发现的材料，有人以为失去的连锁已经被找着了，这发现的故事是这样：一九二四年，在非洲南部一个叫做唐斯（Ｔａｕｎｇｓ）的地方，有位人类学家达弟（Ｒ．Ｄａｒｔ）教授曾经发现了一个六岁小孩的头骨，在演化的程度上，这小孩的头骨刚好介乎人与类人猿之间，它的样子看起来还象猿类，而人类可能从这里面演化出来，因此达弟把这个小孩叫做非洲人猿（Ａｕｓｔｒａｌｏｐｉｔｈｅｃｕｓ  Ａｆｒｉｃａｎｕｓ），可惜的是年龄太小，不能据为定论、到一九三六年，有位布朗（Ｒ．Ｂｒｏｏｍ）博士又在同区的附近发现了一个头盖骨，几片头骨和八个牙齿，形状很和前面六岁的小孩相近。一九三七年，从美国来了两位原封人牙齿特有研究的专家，到非洲共同研究。他们研究的结果，认为这是一种与黑猩猩和大猩猩有联系的类人猿，但其牙齿则与类人猿不同，而与原人的牙齿颇为近似。因此他们认为非洲人猿应当接近为类人猿与人的共同祖先，而其演化程度不过较森林无尾猿稍高而已。
    现在世界的人种大别可以分为黑、白、黄三大支，人类学家相信这三支人是一个来源的。然而人类最早的起源地究竟在什么地方？一般的意见都集中在中亚细亚一带。一九一一年，梅梭（Ｗ．Ｄ．Ｍａｔｔｈｅｗ）博士曾经做过如下的假定：
    现在一般人的意见以为最古人类的起源地可能是中亚细亚的大平原上。在这个区域里面，今天是荒凉不毛，少人居住。但可能是今天我们所采集到的最古文化的遗存地。围绕着这个区域是有纪录的最古的文化区，西至迦勒底、小亚细亚和埃及，南至印度，东至中国。……
    梅梭的这个假定由于古人种化石骨骼的陆续发现，已经得到证明。这种古人种始于一八九一到一八九二年爪哇直立猿人（Ｐｔｈｅｃａｎｔｈｒｏｐｕｓｅｒｅｃｔｕｓ）的发现，一九二八年以后，北京人化石遗骨的陆续出土，一九四一年古爪哇巨人（Ｍｅｇａｎｔｈｒｏｐｕｓ  Ｐａｌａｅｏｊａｖａｎｉｃｕｓ）的发现，这些人骨化石证明了亚洲的地下埋藏着今天欧洲尚未发现的古人种，他们的年代大概距今有五十至一百万年。从演化程度上看来，大概以古爪哇巨人最早也最原始，爪哇直立猿人次之，北京人最后，但这三种骨骼彼此都极为近似，可以证明他们是一脉相传。这些古人种截止今天为止，可以说是人与类人猿分家后的第一批，也是今天已经发现的最早人种。
    与古人种相对立的是现代人种（Ｈｏｍｏ  Ｓａｐｉｌｉｍ）这一种现代人是从古人种演化出来，可是他们的体质特点上却与古人种有着相当的差异。好比古人种的下颏不显，颚部突出甚厉、鼻子扁陷，眉峰骨突出，前额低下而短。模样儿很不大好看，现代人大体上没有这种毛病。现代人的历史过去认为只有两万年，可是由于一九四六年八月法国南部萨朗特人（Ｃｈａｒｅｎｔｅｍａｎ）的发现，已把年代推到十万年以前了。这些现代人种加上欧洲陆续发现的若干从五万到三四十万年以前的古代化石人，再加上前面所列的亚洲古人种，正好形成一个串连的行列，从此上接到非洲人猿与森林无尾猿，可以重构一段如何“从猿到人”的历史。
