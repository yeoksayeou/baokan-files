Spanning the Yellow River
  Erecting High-Altitude Lines
The Yellow River Committee's telecommunications team is building a relatively permanent river-crossing line across the ever-changing Yellow River. On the one hand, it must be more than ten zhang above the water surface, with a width of 750 meters (1.5 li); on the other hand, it must ensure that no problems occur with the river-crossing line during the flood season and that it does not hinder large ships from navigating. This arduous and great project, under the active efforts and precise design of the telecommunications workers, successfully erected a 14.8-zhang-high overhead line on the Bahe River surface in Jiangsu.
    The project started on May 28th. The workers first drove two 1,000-meter steel wire ropes and joint poles every day, and carried stones from the dangerous embankment to the west bank of the river to build a solid foundation. All the preparatory work was ready, but the biggest problem was how to erect this 14.8-zhang-high power pole?
    At 12:00 noon on June 10th, the work of erecting the power pole officially began. In addition to the participation of all members of the telecommunications team, more than 150 people and more than 40 members of the Juancheng section engineering team were mobilized to jointly participate in this arduous task.
    A great and tense scene began.
    The towering and thick pole was pulled by more than 150 people with 18 ropes and a wire cable. The pole was gradually rising. However, the pole was too high. The middle part rose, but the top was still lying on the ground. Workers Zhuang Tiliang, Zhang Yuguang and a dozen other comrades immediately used five support poles to raise the pole completely. The huge pole gradually rose at a 45-degree angle. A large group of workers and masses densely surrounded this giant-like pole. Everyone was excited, nervous, and joyful, mixed with slogans and the sound of the specially made windmill on the pole, which resounded throughout the earth.
    At this moment, the wire rope suddenly broke, and more than a dozen hemp ropes could hardly support it. The 20,000-jin heavy pole was about to collapse in an instant. In this very critical moment, the masses rioted, and some people even began to run away. At this time, Zhang Yuguang, Zhuang Tiliang, Lu Lixun and a dozen other workers, with calm and agile actions, immediately blocked it with five sets of support poles. Seeing that the support poles were bent, they finally supported it and reversed this dangerous situation. Everyone broke out in a cold sweat for these dozen young workers. Many people took a long breath in breathless silence. The lives of dozens of people were safely passed through the danger under the heroic actions of these dozen workers.
    The first pole erection failed. The masses and cadres put forward improvement suggestions to this team of young workers, and all the members of the telecommunications team also humbly reviewed the reasons for the failure. They were not pessimistic or disappointed and prepared to succeed next time.
    The second pole erection began at 2:00 pm on the 11th. In order to ensure the safety of the pole when it was raised, a steel wire rope was added to the top. So the pole gradually rose again. People were shouting, the windmill was whistling, and the great and vivid scene aroused people's excitement and joy again. But just as it was about to be completed, a rope in the middle hindered the pole from rising, causing it to remain at a 70-degree inclination. If it stagnates like this, the danger of the previous day will occur again. Everyone was anxious, considering ways to resolve the situation. Suddenly, the young man Ma Qizhong squeezed up. He took off his clothes, hugged the shaking pole and climbed up. Everyone's eyes and hopes were on him alone. The comrades below were concerned about the brave young man, fearing that there would be any unexpected danger, but he finally quickly climbed to his destination and untied the rope that was hindering the ascent. However, after he came down, blood was flowing from his stomach and legs, but Comrade Ma was just smiling excitedly. The victory of the work made him forget his pain.
    After the pole was erected, the three layers of wire were also tied to the pulling piles, and the pole on the east bank dam was finally completed. Worker Liu Fajin first climbed this 14-zhang-high pole and untied more than a dozen hemp ropes and iron wires, sitting happily on the crossbar at the top of the pole. Everyone excitedly applauded and cheered for the victory.
    The pole on the west bank was also erected on the afternoon of the 12th. Lu Lixun did not undertake the task of climbing the pole when he erected the "@山" river-crossing line last time. This time, at the Youth League meeting, he requested approval to climb the pole. Therefore, when everyone was vying to complete the task of untying the rope on this pole, Lu Lixun finally realized his wish.
    The final project was laying the line. Due to the turbulent waters of the Yellow River, laying the line became a relatively difficult task. If the line fell into the water, due to the speed of the water flow, this steel wire could not be pulled out. Therefore, a large boat and people had to support the line to keep it away from the water. At the same time, the wire tightening work on the tops of the two poles required courage and the ability to persist in working in the air more than 14 zhang high for seven or eight hours. When all the comrades in the team were considering who could complete this task, the model workers Xiao Zhang, Sun Shichun, Lu Lixun and Dong Shufu were the first to sign up. As a result, the wire tightening work was successfully completed.
    On the towering poles, the red flag was waving in the clear sky, and the river-crossing line made a buzzing sound, which was coordinated with the pleasant sound of the windmill. It aroused endless praise from many passing pedestrians.

### 横跨黄河　架起高空线

　　横跨黄河
  　架起高空线
    黄委会电讯队要在变化不定的黄河上建设一道比较永久的过河线，它一方面要高出水面十丈以上。宽度为七百五十公尺（一里半）；另一方面还要保证大水期过河线不发生问题及不妨碍大船通航，这件艰苦伟大的工程，在电讯工人的积极努力和精确设计下，在江苏坝河面上胜利地把一道十四丈八尺高的空中线架设成功了。
    工程从五月二十八日开始，工人们首先每天打两根一千公尺的钢丝绳和接杆子，并从险工坝上向河西突击运石，以修筑坚固地基。一切准备工作都就绪了，但碰到了一个最大问题，就是如何把这个十四丈八尺高的电线杆竖起来？
    六月十号上午十二时，竖立电杆的工作正式开始了。除电讯队全体人员参加外，并动员了一百五十名群众和鄄城段工程队四十余名，来共同参加这一艰巨的工作。
    一幕伟大而紧张的场面开始了。
    高耸而又粗大的杆子被一百五十多人用十八根绳和一根铁丝缆牵拉着，眼看杆子渐渐升起了。但，杆子太高，中间起来了，上头还依旧伏着地。工人庄体良、张玉广等十几个同志立刻以五个支杆使杆子全部升起来，庞大的杆子，这时已成为四十五度的弯弓角度逐渐上升。黑压压的一大群工人和群众团团围拢着这根巨人似的杆子。大家兴奋、紧张、欢跃，夹杂着口号声、以及杆子上头特制的风车声，震彻在大地上。
    就在这时，突然铁丝绳断了，十几根麻绳也难以支持，两万斤重的大杆子倾刻间就要压下来。在这十分危急的时候，群众骚动了，甚至有的人已经开始逃跑。这时张玉广、庄体良、鲁利训等十几个工人，以镇静而敏捷的行动，随即用五付支杆拦住，眼看支杆都被压弯了，但终于支持住并挽回了这一危局。大家都替这十几个年青的工人出了一把冷汗，多少人都在摒声窒气下长长地出了一口气，几十个人的性命，在这十几个工人英勇的行动下，安然渡过了危险。
    第一次竖杆失败了。群众及干部对这一队年青工人提出了改进意见，而电讯队的全体人员也虚心地检讨了此次失败的原因，他们没有悲观失望，准备下次一定要获得成功。
    第二次立杆是在十一日下午二时开始的。为了使杆子升起时安全，最上头又增加了一根钢丝绳，于是杆子又渐渐上升了，人声喧哗、风车鸣叫，伟大生动的景象又激起人们的兴奋与欢跃。但就在这即将完成的时候，中间的一根绳，阻碍了杆子的起立，使它停留在七十度的倾斜度上。这样停滞下去，又会发生象前一天的危险。大家都在焦急着，考虑着解救的办法。忽然青年马起忠挤上来，他把衣服一脱，抱住摇动的杆子爬了上去，多少人的视线和希望都穿在他一人的身上，下边的同志都关心着这勇敢的青年，怕出了什么意外的危险，但他终于很快地爬到了目的地，把阻碍上升的那根绳子解了下来，但在他下来后，肚子和腿上都流出了鲜血，而马同志却只是在兴奋的笑着，工作的胜利，使他忘掉了自己的痛苦。
    杆子竖立起来后，三层扒线也已经拴在拉桩上，东岸堤坝上的杆子最后也完成了。工人刘法金首先登上了这十四丈多高的杆子，把十几根麻绳、铁丝解下来，愉快地坐在杆顶的横杆上。大家都兴奋的鼓起掌来，欢呼着胜利。
    西岸的一根杆子也于十二日下午竖立起来了。鲁利训在上次架＠山过河线时，由于没有担任爬杆子的任务，这次在青年团会议上，就要求批准他爬杆子，因此，当大家都争着想完成这一根杆子的解绳任务时，终于让鲁利训实现了他的愿望。
    最后的工程是放线，由于黄河水势汹涌，放线也成了比较困难的工作。假若线落入水，由于水的流速，这一根钢丝线就不可能拉出来了，因此，就非用大船和人把线支持着离开水面不可。同时在两杆顶上的紧线工作，必须有勇气，并能在十四丈多高的空中坚持七、八个钟头的工作。当全队的同志都在考虑着谁能完成这一任务时，模范的小张、孙世春、鲁利训和董树福四个人首先报名，结果，紧线工作顺利的完成了。
    高耸的杆子上，红旗在晴空下招展着，过河线发出嗡嗡的声音，配合着风车悦耳的音律，它引起多少来往行人们不绝的夸赞。
