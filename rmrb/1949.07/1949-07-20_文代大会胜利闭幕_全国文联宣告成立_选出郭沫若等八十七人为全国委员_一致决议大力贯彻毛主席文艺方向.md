    Literary and Art Congress Successfully Concludes
    All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Established
    Guo Moruo and 87 Others Elected as National Committee Members
    Unanimous Resolution to Vigorously Implement Chairman Mao's Literary and Art Direction
    [Our Dispatch] The All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers, after fourteen days, successfully concluded yesterday morning (the 19th). At the same time, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles was formally established.

    The closing ceremony of the congress was held at 8:30 a.m. Chairman Feng Xuefeng first announced the list of elected members of the National Committee of the Federation. After Chairman Guo Moruo delivered a closing report (full text in another article), Zhou Wen read out the vote counts of all the elected members. Guo Moruo, Ding Ling, Mao Dun, Zhou Yang and 87 others were elected as members, and Bao Han and 26 others were elected as alternate members (full list in another article).

    Next, the chairman read out the congress declaration, the three telegrams of salute from the congress to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, and the preparatory committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, as well as the resolution of the All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers, which were unanimously approved by all the delegates with applause. After a ten-minute break, the Beijing Special Handicraft Industry Union presented a banner to the congress.

    Finally, Guo Moruo delivered a closing speech to the congress: He affirmed that the congress was a success. Then he analyzed the reasons for the success, saying that first of all, we must thank Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Vice Chairman Zhou and other leaders for their encouragement and instructions (the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly); secondly, we must thank the democratic parties, people's organizations, troops, government departments, fraternal ethnic groups, and foreign democratic cultural and art groups for their concern; we must thank the more than 2,000 comrades from various cultural and art troupes and art groups for their performances; we must thank the band, reception, transportation, liaison, news, photography and other comrades who participated in the work of various departments of the congress for their active work; again, he announced that the congress started for one million catties of millet, equivalent to the one-year living expenses of three to four thousand farmers, so he especially thanked the Chinese peasant masses (the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly); then he pointed out that the congress could be held safely in Beiping, and even more thanks to the People's Liberation Army fighting bravely in the front and the armed forces defending Beiping (the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly). Finally, he said that the congress was a concentrated and effective learning opportunity, and he called on everyone to "live and learn." After the closing of the congress, he hoped that everyone would work hard, learn from the heroic and good at fighting People's Liberation Army, and learn from the hard-working workers and peasants, so that the new China's literature and art can continue to grow brilliantly.

    After the congress presented silk banners to the cultural and art troupes that performed for the congress, it passed a temporary motion: (1) To send a telegram to literary and art workers around the world to unite and smash the conspiracy of the war-mongers headed by U.S. imperialism to undermine world peace and to stop U.S. imperialism from aiding Chiang. (2) To send a congratulatory message to the People's Liberation Army for its great victories on the Northwest and Central China fronts.

    The congress successfully concluded at approximately 11:00 a.m. amidst the slogans of "Literary and art workers across the country unite to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers," "Long live the Communist Party of China," "Long live Chairman Mao," and the magnificent music. (Bai Sheng)
    [Our Dispatch] The full text of the resolution passed by the All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers is as follows:
  Resolution of the All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers
    The congress listened to the political report of Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai and the general report of Guo Moruo on the literary and art movement in the new China, and unanimously believes that the direction and tasks pointed out by them for the future efforts of Chinese literary and art workers under the literary and art policy of Chairman Mao Zedong are completely correct. We unanimously agree with their reports and accept them as the guidelines for our future work, and are determined to implement and execute them with the greatest effort.
