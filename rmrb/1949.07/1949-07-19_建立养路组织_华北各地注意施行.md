Establish Road Maintenance Organizations
Attention to Implementation in Various Parts of North China
[This newspaper reported] Various parts of North China have begun to pay attention to road maintenance work. In the past six months, road maintenance organizations have been established and road workers added in Shijiazhuang, Handan, Pingshan, and Baoding. After the March transportation conference, management sections were successively established to handle road maintenance work. Except for the main lines, which are the responsibility of the General Bureau, the administrative offices and provincial governments are responsible for setting up their own arrangements for expenses within the road maintenance fees collected, according to the standard of one road maintenance worker per five Chinese miles. General highways are limited to leveling and padding the road surface and prohibiting the passage of iron-wheeled carts, adopting focused and concentrated work methods. The maintenance mileage is mainly focused on the three major lines: Pinghan, Pingkai, and Jinpu. Ten management sections have been successively established on the three major lines, with technicians, road maintenance team leaders, road patrollers, and road workers in each section. In order to maintain the constant integrity of the road and facilitate transportation, it is necessary to maintain the road well. However, the road maintenance task is also very large. The General Bureau of Highways, in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for the Collection of Road Maintenance Fees for Automobiles and Rubber-Wheeled Carts" promulgated by the North China People's Government, has established 33 management offices and stations on the Pinghan, Pingda, and Jinpu lines, as well as in the Tianjin area, and began collecting fees in May of this year. In May, 16.18 million yuan was collected, and in June, it reached 22.94 million yuan. The road maintenance fees collected, after deducting expenses, have a surplus. Currently, the provinces of Chahar, Jidong, Jizhong, Taihang, and Jiluyu have all begun collecting fees one after another.

    建立养路组织
    华北各地注意施行
    【本报讯】华北各地对养路工作已开始注意。半年来先后于石家庄、邯郸、平山、保定各段开始建立养路组织，添设路工。三月交通会议后陆续建立管理段，办理护养路工作。除主要干线由总局负责外，各行署省府由交通处或省公路局按照每五华里一养路员的标准自行设法在收入养路费内开支。一般公路已限于平垫路面及禁止铁轮大车通行，采取有重点与集中的工作方法进行。护养里程以平汉、平开、津浦三大干线为主。在三大干线上先后成立管理段十个，段内设技术员、养路队长、护路员、路工等。为保持公路之经常完整、便利运输，必须把路养好。但养路任务亦甚巨大。公路总局依照华北人民政府颁布之公路征收汽车、胶皮轮大车养路费暂行办法，已在平汉、平大、津浦三大干线及平津地区建立管理所与管理站共三十三处，自本年五月份开始征收。五月份已征收一千六百十八万元，六月份达二千二百九十四万。以上所收养路费，除开支外均有盈余，现察哈尔、冀东、冀中、太行、冀鲁豫等省均已先后开征。
