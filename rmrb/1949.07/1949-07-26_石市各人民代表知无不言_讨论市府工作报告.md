Shijiazhuang Telegram: The Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Congress discussed Vice Mayor Zang's "Report on the Work of the People's Government in the Past Year and a Half." The representatives unanimously agreed that this report was in line with the development of the city's work. They praised the People's Government for overcoming many difficulties and achieving these results in a short period of just over a year, while also raising some supplementary opinions and questions. Some representatives also suggested that the report's examination of shortcomings was not profound enough. The main opinions are as follows: (1) On restoring and developing production: The representatives agreed with the analysis in Vice Mayor Zang Boping's report, with some suggesting that the government's planning in restoring and developing industry and commerce was insufficient, leading to some products being out of sync with the market. Public enterprises lacked a unified pace, causing unnecessary impacts on production. At the same time, there was a lack of appropriate connections between public enterprises and private industry and commerce. (2) Labor-Capital Issues: During group discussions, it was believed that both labor and capital must benefit to develop production. Currently, some individual private factories still have some issues between labor and capital that require government assistance to resolve. (3) Finance and Taxation: The representatives believed that the government's complete disclosure of the specific details of financial revenue and expenditure to the people was unprecedented. The unified taxation method was a great advantage in the work of the People's Government and should be emphasized in the report. Some representatives suggested that after the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, some merchants reduced their capital and engaged in speculative business to evade industrial and commercial taxes, which should be stopped to allow legitimate commerce to develop. (4) Supporting the War: The representatives believed that there were achievements in supporting the war. However, there was insufficient care for the families of martyrs and soldiers, and factories should give the children of martyrs and soldiers certain priorities. (5) Urban-Rural Relations: The representatives believed that the establishment of farmer service centers was very good. However, what the rural areas need and how the cities can plan production still lacked investigation and research in the past. (6) On Municipal Construction: The representatives believed that there were achievements, but there were also some shortcomings, such as the drainage system not being well-repaired, insufficient electrical safety equipment, sometimes causing danger, and frequent traffic accidents. In addition, the report should explain the establishment of hospitals in the city. (7) Political Power Construction: The representatives believed that the abolition of district and street political power was very good, but whether the li and zu (neighborhood units) should be abolished should be clarified. The style of some public security personnel and street/li cadres was not good, and education should be strengthened to correct them. (8) Public Security and Justice: The representatives believed that the establishment of revolutionary order in the city in the past year or so was an achievement. Now, "smashing open flames" (arson) and "roadblocking" have basically been eliminated. They were satisfied with the people's court's policy of transforming and educating criminals. However, the handling of cases was not timely enough, such as the embezzlement case of the manager of Huafeng Bank, which has not been completely resolved for a long time. Finally, Mayor Liu Xiufeng said: "Criticism of the government's work is just the beginning, and I hope that the representatives will offer more opinions in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything."

　　石市各人民代表知无不言
  　讨论市府工作报告
    【石家庄电】石市人民代表大会讨论臧副市长“一年半以来人民市政府工作的报告”。代表们一致同意这个报告是符合于本市工作发展的情况的。对于人民市政府在短短一年多的时间内，克服了很多困难而获得这些成绩，表示赞扬，同时也提出一些补充的意见和疑问。还有的代表提出这个报告中对缺点的检查还不够深刻。总的意见主要有以下各点：（１）关于恢复与发展生产：代表们同意臧伯平副市长报告上的分析，有的提出政府在恢复和发展工商业中的计划性不够，使得有些生产品和市场脱节。公营企业间缺乏统一的步调，使得生产上受不必要的影响。同时公营企业与私营工商业间还缺乏适当的联系。（２）劳资问题：各小组讨论时认为必须劳资两利才能发展生产，目前个别私营工厂，劳资双方尚有一些问题，需要政府帮助解决。（３）财政、税收问题：代表们认为政府把财政收支的具体情形完全向人民公布，这是以前任何政府所没有过的；关于统一税收的办法，这是人民市政府工作中很大的优点，应该在报告中强调出来。有的代表提出平津解放后有些商户把资金缩小，另从事投机生意逃避工商税，应加以制止，使正当的商业得以发展。（４）支援战争：对支援战争代表们认为是有成绩的；但对于烈属、军属照顾的不够，工厂应给烈属、军属子女以某些优先权。（５）城乡关系：代表们认为农民服务所的设立是很好的；但农村需要什么，城市如何有计划的进行生产，这一点过去还缺乏调查研究。（６）关于市政建设：代表们认为是有成绩的；但还有一些缺点：如排水道修的还不够好，电的安全设备不够，有时发生危险，交通秩序管理常出事故。另外，市内医院建立情形报告中应加以说明。（７）政权建设：对于取消区街政权代表们认为这是很好的；但闾、组是否取消，应加说明。个别公安工作人员及街、闾干部作风不好，应加强教育纠正。（８）公安、司法：代表们认为这一年多城市的革命秩序的建立是有成绩的，如今“砸明火”“截道”事情基本上消灭了，对人民法院改造教育犯人的政策认为满意；但在处理案件上还不够及时，象华丰银号经理的贪污案，很久未彻底解决。最后，刘秀峰市长说：“对于政府工作的批评还只是个开端，希望代表们本着知无不言，言无不尽的精神多提意见”。
