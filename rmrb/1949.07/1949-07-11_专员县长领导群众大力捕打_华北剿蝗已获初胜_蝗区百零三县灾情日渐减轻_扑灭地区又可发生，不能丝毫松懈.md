　　[This News Report] Reports: Locusts continue to emerge in various parts of North China, and locust control work is being carried out more intensely and has achieved great success. After the locusts appeared, the administrative offices immediately instructed the elimination of locusts to protect seedlings. Special commissioners and county heads personally took the lead in establishing locust control organizations, assigning responsibilities. In addition to actively mobilizing the masses, a large number of cadres, technicians, teachers, and students were mobilized to participate in the locust control campaign, which reached a climax by mid-June, especially in the Taihang area. In this area, locusts occurred in 1,944 villages in 24 counties, covering an area of approximately 1.91 million mu. In the most severely affected areas of Anyang, Wu'an, and Ci County, the number of people involved in locust control reached 200,000 daily. In the Fifth Administrative Region, from May 25 to June 19, the number of people participating in locust control reached 1,790,000, eliminating locusts on over 910,000 mu. Now, the locusts have been basically eliminated, and the campaign has moved to the mopping-up phase. In Jinnan, locusts occurred in 1,354 villages in 24 counties and one city, covering an area of 410,000 mu. The Third and Fourth Administrative Regions were the most severely affected. In the Third Administrative Region, eleven counties continuously fought locusts for half a month, with 310,000 people participating. Five counties have basically eliminated the locusts. The junction of the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts of Longyao in the Fourth Administrative Region was the most severely affected, covering an area of 100,000 mu, and most of the locusts have been eliminated by June 13. The locust outbreak in Jizhong occurred later and covered a wide area, with locusts occurring in 968 villages in 36 counties throughout the region, covering an area of 330,000 mu. The leadership promptly mobilized the masses to capture and eliminate locusts at the beginning stage. Now, all locusts that appeared before the 20th in the Eighth Administrative Region have been eliminated, and those that appeared successively on the 24th are being captured and eliminated. In the Ninth Administrative Region, 79 villages out of 161 villages have been eliminated, covering approximately 170,000 mu. In the Tenth and Eleventh Administrative Regions, locusts have been largely eliminated in eight counties covering more than 60,000 mu. In Chahar, locust nymphs have occurred in twelve counties. In the Jianping Administrative Region, locust nymphs have occurred in eight counties except for Jianping. Quyang is the most severely affected, having spread to 105 villages. More than 10,000 people are organized daily to capture and eliminate locusts. The fifth district and Yun, Ying, Zheng, and other counties have basically eliminated the locusts. In eastern Hebei, grasshoppers and large locusts occurred in 29 villages in Luan County and Qian'an, and they have been eliminated. In early June, flying locusts and locust nymphs occurred in 16 villages in Ninghe and 13 villages in Fengnan. The area north of Junliangcheng covers 40 to 50 *li*. The Junliangcheng Farm of the Tianjin-Gu Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Bureau and the local government established a joint command, and more than 80% of the locusts have been eliminated. In Taiyue Jiyuan, locust nymphs occurred in six villages on May 28. Forces were concentrated to use fire to surround and attack the locusts, and they were all eliminated within two days. Thanks to the joint efforts of all cadres and the masses, the struggle against locusts has been victorious. Although locusts have been basically eliminated in severely affected areas, locust control is still underway in general areas. After the first round of elimination, the locusts have reappeared. Locust nymphs have reappeared in Taiyue Jiyuan, involving a total of 56 villages in Lianmeng County. Some of them are locally born, and some are transmitted from Jiaozuo, Qinyang, and Wen County. In the Third Administrative Region of Jinnan, locusts have continuously reappeared in Handan, Yongnian, Qi Zhi, and Feixiang after the locusts were captured and eliminated. The capture and elimination are now being vigorously carried out. In the Fourth Administrative Region, due to incomplete capture and elimination in Longyao, Ningnan, Nanhe, and Ren County, many locust nymphs have turned into flying locusts. After the 24th in Jizhong, locusts continued to appear in most areas of the fourteen counties in the Eighth and Ninth Administrative Regions. In the Chihkan Beach of Heihe River in eastern Hebei, there are still some residual locust nymphs, and they are being poisoned with agents. Currently, it is the egg-laying season for summer locusts. Governments at all levels should be fully vigilant, promptly summarize the experiences and lessons of locust control, make persistent efforts, lead the masses to completely eliminate locusts, and prevent locust nymphs from turning into flying locusts and continuing to lay eggs.
