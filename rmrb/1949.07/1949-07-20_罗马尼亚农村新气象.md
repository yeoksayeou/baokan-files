    New Atmosphere in Romanian Rural Areas
    Boluofusiji
    For centuries, Romanian peasants waged a stubborn struggle for independence and land. The German Hohenzollern dynasty was the head of the big landlords, occupying the best land and forests. At the same time, 57 percent of Romanian peasants had only pitiful small plots of land, which could not even guarantee their livelihood, and more than one million peasants had no land at all. In the age of electricity and machines, peasants were forced to till the land with wooden plows, and even half of the peasants had to borrow wooden plows. Famine, poverty, and ignorance were the fate of the Romanian countryside.
    After Romania was liberated by the Soviet army, it was freed from the shackles of imperialism, and its people began a new life. In 1945, the land reform largely liquidated the property of landlords and greatly restricted the capitalist elements in the countryside. As a result of this land reform, 900,000 peasants with little or no land obtained more than one million hectares of arable land. The government initially established 270 machine and tractor stations, owning more than 3,000 tractors, cultivators, threshers, and other agricultural machines.
    When Romania suffered from drought, the Soviet Union provided assistance, sending Romania food, seeds, fertilizers, and the best Soviet-made agricultural machines.
    The 1949 plan stipulates a further increase in agricultural production; industrial crops will increase by 80 percent, hemp by 104 percent, and cotton by 480 percent. Viticulture and tobacco planting will be greatly developed. The development of animal husbandry is also being emphasized.
    Thanks to the assistance provided by the Soviet Union, Romanian industry has begun to manufacture tractors for the first time in history, producing 1,000 agricultural machines last year. Last year, the land sown with machines was more than eight times that of 1938.
    The extensive assistance given to farmers by machine and tractor stations, and the victory of state farms in utilizing the latest scientific achievements and technologies, are of great importance in making working farmers understand and be convinced of the superiority of collective farming. Farmers are increasingly starting to organize agricultural cooperatives. In the autumn sowing campaign alone, 28,000 mutual-aid teams were organized.
    The composition of the Provisional Committee of the People's Assembly is a major event in the lives of the working people in the Romanian countryside. The Provisional Committee organizes many volunteer groups among the peasants to engage in swamp reclamation and malaria eradication. This work is already underway in the Prut River basin (bordering Rosu), in the river-flooded swamp area of the Danube basin, and in Banat, Moldavia, and Muntenia.
    Ensuring the economic and social prosperity of the Romanian countryside is closely linked to its cultural development. The vast majority of the Romanian people are now studying. Not only are children studying in primary and secondary schools, but hundreds of thousands of adults are also taking remedial classes. A network of specialized schools is being established throughout the country to train thousands of experts, agronomists, zoologists, veterinarians, and tractor drivers. In the first three months of 1949, an unprecedented number of rural libraries, totaling 610, were developed, with a collection of 1.3 million books. In the same period, the number of cinemas also doubled. (Originally published in Pravda on June 18) (Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th)

    罗马尼亚农村新气象
    勃罗夫斯基
    几世纪以来，罗马尼亚农民为争取独立和土地进行了顽强的斗争。德国霍亨索伦王朝就是大地主头子，它占有最好的土地和森林。同时，百分之五十七的罗马尼亚农民，却只有可怜的小块土地，它甚至不能作为保证他们维持生活的手段，而且，有一百万以上的农民全无土地。在电气和机器的时代，农民却被迫以木犁去耕地，甚至一半的农民连木犁也要去借用。饥馑、贫穷和愚昧就是罗马尼亚农村的命运。
    罗马尼亚被苏军解放以后，它才摆脱了帝国主义的桎梏，它的人民才开始了新的生活。在一九四五年，土地改革就大体上清算了地主的财产和大大地限制了农村的资本主义分子。由于这一土地改革的结果，九十万少地或无地的农民，得到了一百万余公顷的可耕地。政府首批建立了二七○个机器与拖拉机站，拥有三千余台拖拉机、耕作机、打谷机和其他农业机器。
    当罗马尼亚因天旱而遭受灾害时，苏联便加以援助，送给罗马尼亚以食物、种子、肥料和苏联造的最好的农业机器。
    一九四九年的计划规定进一步地增加农业生产；工业作物增加百分之八十，大麻增加百分之一百零四，棉花增加百分之四百八十。葡萄园艺和烟叶栽植将大大发展。发展养畜业也受到重视。
    由于苏联所给予的援助，罗马尼亚的工业有史以来地开始首次制造拖拉机，去年就生产了一千台农业机器。在去年，用机器播种的土地，较一九三八年已多出八倍以上。
    机器与拖拉机站所给予农民的广泛的援助，和国家农场利用最新科学成就与技术的胜利，对于使劳动农民明了和确信集体耕作之优越性一点，具有巨大的重要性，农民愈来愈广泛地开始组织农业合作社。仅在秋季播种运动中，即已组织了二万八千个共耕队。
    人民议会临时委员会的组成，是罗马尼亚农村劳动人民生活中的重大事件。临时委员会在农民当中组织许多志愿小组，从事开垦沼泽地和扑灭疟疾的工作。这种工作已在普卢特河流域（罗苏边境）、在多脑河盆地的河泛沼泽地带、在巴纳特、摩尔达维亚和孟第尼亚进行中。
    保证罗马尼亚乡村经济与社会的繁荣，是紧密地与它的文化发展联系着的。绝大多数的罗马尼亚人民现在正在学习。不仅儿童在小学和中学读书，并且有数十万成人在补习。训练成千专家、农学家、动物学家、兽医和拖拉机司机的专门学校网，正在全国建立起来。在一九四九年头三个月中，前所未有的乡村图书馆，其数目已发展到六一○所，藏书已达一百三十万册。在同一时期，电影院也增加了两倍。（原载六月十八日真理报）（新华社北平十九日电）
