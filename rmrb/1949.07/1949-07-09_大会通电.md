Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, July 7th: Circular Telegram of the Beiping People from All Walks of Life Commemorating the 12th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War:

　　We, the two million people of Beiping, are today commemorating the 12th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War with joyful and enthusiastic fervor. We celebrate the great victory of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, celebrate the great victory of the three-year People's Liberation War, and at the same time celebrate the establishment of the preparatory committee for the New Political Consultative Conference, and support the prompt convening of the New Political Consultative Conference and the establishment of a democratic coalition government.

　　While celebrating victory today, we must not forget the reactionary policies adopted by the American imperialists in violation of the Potsdam Agreement, condoning the Japanese war criminals who invaded China to remain at large, attempting to indefinitely delay the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, and long-term occupying Japan, and supporting Japan's aggressive forces, making it a colony and military base of the United States, directly threatening the Chinese people, directly threatening the Japanese people, and threatening world peace and security. We, the people of Beiping, have long suffered from the enslavement and oppression of the Japanese invaders, and can no longer tolerate such reactionary policies of the American imperialists. In order to finally realize the goals of the Anti-Japanese War, it is necessary to strictly abide by the Potsdam Agreement, and a peace treaty with Japan must be signed promptly with the participation of Chinese representatives dispatched by the democratic coalition government produced by the new Political Consultative Conference, to realize Japan's independence and democracy, and thoroughly eliminate the Japanese aggressive forces supported by the American imperialists.

　　Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of Beiping are making great efforts to restore and develop production, restore and develop the people's cultural and educational undertakings, and are working with the people of the whole country to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely wipe out the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries, liberate all of China, and unite closely with the Soviet Union, the strong fortress in the international democratic camp, and the new democratic countries, the people of the colonies and semi-colonies, and the people of the world, to strive for lasting world peace and people's democracy.

　　The two million people of our city resolutely support the declaration issued by all parties and groups of the preparatory committee for the New Political Consultative Conference in commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, and will strive with all our strength to achieve it.

　　People of the whole country, unite!

　　Establish an independent, free, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China!

　　Long live the People's Democratic Republic of China!

    我们在今天庆祝胜利的时候，决不可忘记美帝国主义者所采取的违反波茨坦协定的反动政策，纵容日本侵华战犯逍遥法外，企图无限期地拖延对日和约的签订，长期占领日本，并扶植日本的侵略势力，使之成为美国的殖民地和军事基地，直接威胁着中国人民，直接威胁着日本人民，并威胁着世界的和平与安全。我们北平市人民长期遭受日本侵略者的奴役与压迫，对于美帝国主义者这种反动政策，再也不能容忍了。为了最后实现抗日战争的目的，必须严格遵守波茨坦协定，并必须在新的政治协商会议所产生的民主联合政府派遣的中国代表参加之下，迅速签订对日和约，实现日本的独立与民主，彻底消灭在美帝国主义者扶植下的日本侵略势力。
    我们北平市人民在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，用极大的努力恢复与发展生产，恢复与发展人民的文化教育事业，并与全国人民同心协力，坚决彻底干净全部地歼灭国民党反动派的残余力量，解放全中国，与国际民主阵营中的强大堡垒苏联和各新民主国家、各殖民地半殖民地的人民和全世界的人民紧紧地团结在一起，为争取世界的持久和平与人民民主而奋斗。
    我全市二百万人民坚决拥护新政治协商会议筹备会各党派各团体为纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年所发表的宣言，并用全力为其实现而奋斗。
    全国人民团结起来！
