Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 14th. The New Democratic Youth League of the Lüshun-Dalian (Lüda) District held its first congress of League members in Dalian on the 1st and 2nd of this month, formally establishing the Lüda District League Committee, summarizing past work, and defining future work guidelines and tasks. More than 350 League member representatives from various enterprises, schools, and other units attended. Gao Tang, Yang Disheng, Zhu Yujin, and Han Tianshi, members of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China, and Ouyang Qin, secretary of the Lüda District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, attended and provided guidance. The congress first warmly celebrated the 28th anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party and elected Liu Nansheng, Ding Zhemin and 29 others to form the Lüda District Committee of the Youth League.

The congress discussed and adopted the report made by Ding Zhemin, deputy director of the District League Preparatory Committee, on the basic summary of youth work in the Lüda area over the past two years and the establishment of the League over the past four months, as well as the tasks for the future. The congress believes that since the Lüda area was liberated by the Soviet army in August 1945, the youth of Lüda have been freed from the 42 years of enslavement rule by the Japanese invaders. With the help of the Soviet garrison and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they have gradually established the idea of serving the people. After the Chinese Communist Party of Lüda became public this April, the broad masses of young people have set off an upsurge of support for the Party, and the desire to join the Party or the Youth League has become their common aspiration. In the three years since the liberation of Lüda, the broad masses of young people have gained full opportunities for schooling and employment, and have become an indispensable new force in learning and various work, especially in production and construction. At present, the number of middle school students in the district alone has doubled compared with the time of the Japanese invaders' rule, especially with more children of workers and peasants. According to incomplete statistics from 262 Sino-Soviet joint ventures and public enterprises in Lüda at the end of last year, young employees accounted for about 50 percent of the total number of employees. They have played an exemplary and backbone role in various enterprises. Among the 22 model workers in the postal and telecommunications departments, young workers accounted for 18. They are not only ordinary workers, but also many young people have been trained as technicians and skilled workers, and many have been promoted to production managers. At present, there are 484 young technicians, etc., 45 young factory directors, 115 department-level cadres of the Party or the workers' union, etc., and 260 section and unit chiefs in Lüda.

The congress believes that since the establishment of the League in the Lüda area in March this year, the broad masses of young people have shown a new atmosphere in production and construction and learning, and the work of establishing the League has also achieved remarkable results. In the district, 248 branches and 20 general branches have been established in factories alone. There are a total of 4,018 League members in the district, of whom young workers account for 62 percent. They have played an active role in promoting production and learning. However, there are still shortcomings in the work of establishing the League. For example, for a long period of time, the focus of establishing the League was on students and young intellectuals, and the focus was not on young workers, based on the characteristics of the developed industry and the large number of young workers in the Lüda area. For example, in the establishment of the League, many departments have had a closed-doorist tendency, raising the conditions for joining the League too high.

The congress finally determined the tasks for establishing the League in the future, believing that the work of establishing the League should adopt a wave-like development, seeking consolidation in development. In the second half of this year, 15,000 to 20,000 League members should be developed on the existing basis. The focus of establishing the League should be on young workers and revolutionary intellectuals; the countryside should be selectively tested and then promoted in the autumn. The congress emphasized that in the future, the study of Marxism-Leninism should be strengthened among League members and the broad masses of young people to improve their political and professional levels. The congress unanimously passed a telegram of respect to Soviet Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　新民主主义青年团旅大区团
  　举行首届团员代表大会
    正式成立旅大区团委员会
  　大会电斯大林及毛主席致敬
    【新华社大连十四日电】中国新民主主义青年团旅（顺）大（连）区团，本月一、二两日在大连举行首届团员代表大会，正式成立了旅大区团委员会，总结了过去的工作，并规定了今后的工作方针和任务。到会的有各企业、学校等单位团员代表三百五十余人。中国新民主主义青年团中央委员高棠、杨涤生、朱语今、韩天石，中共旅大区党委书记欧阳钦等都出席指导。大会首先热烈庆祝中共诞生二十八周年，并且选出刘南生、丁哲民等三十一人组成青年团旅大区委会。
    大会讨论并通过了区团筹委副主任丁哲民所作的两年来旅大地区青年工作及四个月来建团工作的基本总结和今后任务的报告。大会认为旅大地区自一九四五年八月由苏军解放后，旅大青年脱离了日寇四十二年的奴役统治，在苏联驻军的帮助和中国共产党的领导下，已经逐渐树立起为人民服务的思想。在今年四月旅大中国共产党公开以后，广大青年群众更掀起拥护党的热潮，要求参加党或青年团已成为他们普遍的热望。旅大解放三年多来，广大青年获得了就学、就业的充分机会，在学习及各种工作特别是生产建设中，已经成为一支不可缺少的生力军。现在全区仅中学生的人数就比日寇统治时增多了一倍，其中特别是工农子弟更有增加。据去年底旅大中苏合营及公营的二百六十二个企业单位的不完全统计，青年职工就占全体职工总人数的百分之五十左右。他们在各企业中起了模范和骨干作用。邮电部门二十二名模范工人中，青年工人就占十八名。他们不仅是普通工人，而且有许多青年已经锻炼成技师、技术工人，许多已被提拔为生产管理者。现在旅大有青年技师等四百八十四人、青年厂长四十五人、党或职工会等的部长一级干部一百十五人，科、股长二百六十人。
    大会认为旅大地区自今年三月开始建团以来，广大青年群众在生产建设和学习中更表现了新的气象，建团工作也获得显著成绩。全区单在工厂中现在已经建立了支部二百四十八个、总支二十个。全区共有团员四千零十八人，其中青年工人团员占百分之六十二。对于推动生产和学习起了积极作用。但在建团工作中也还有缺点。比如在较长期间内把建团重点放在学生和知识青年中，没有根据旅大地区工业发达青年工人较多的特点，把建团重点放在青年工人方面。又如在建团中许多部门曾发生过关门主义偏向，把入团条件提得过高。
    大会最后确定了今后建团任务，认为建团工作应采取波浪式的发展，在发展中求巩固。今年下半年应当在现有基础上发展团员一万五千到二万人。建团重点放在青年工人和革命知识分子方面；农村应当有重点地试建，秋季再行推广。大会强调今后应加强团员和广大青年对马列主义的学习，提高政治水平及业务水平。大会一致通过了给苏联斯大林元帅和中共中央毛主席的致敬电。
