Seeing the Labor Contractor Overlord Through Pan Shaotang
	A Record of Kailuan Miners' Accusations in the People's Court
		By Our Correspondent Lin Li

	Speaking of labor contractor overlords, the Kailuan miners grind their teeth in hatred, saying they are a bunch of vampires and cannibals; some curse them as a swarm of lice crawling on the workers. After listening to the accusations of several miner representatives in front of the judge at the public trial of the labor contracting tycoon Pan Shaotang by the Tangshan People's Court, I understood that this hatred and anger was not accidental.
	Liu Yonglu, who has lived in the mine for thirty-eight years, is one of the accusation representatives elected by more than 10,000 workers at the Tangshan mine. He is fifty-three years old this year. He was detained twice by the labor contractor Pan Shaotang: The first time was because he opposed the excessive exploitation by the labor contractor, and he was severely beaten by the thugs hired by the contractor, until he was beaten to death alive at the bottom of the 1,200-foot shaft. But after he woke up, the court sentenced him to forty-five days in prison. What is most infuriating is that in 1936, workers worked eight hours a day, and the wages they earned were not enough to maintain their lives. The workers asked Pan Shaotang to work continuous shifts (i.e., working sixteen hours a day), but Pan refused, saying: "Workers are a kind of monster. They can't be allowed to eat their fill, because if they eat their fill, they won't work hard!" He mobilized the military police and security teams to arrest Liu Yonglu and 36 others one night. At this point, Liu Yonglu panted and shouted: "When you tied us up, you shot along the way and threatened us, saying, 'We will shoot you sons of bitches one by one.' But this Liu did not yield!" The thirty-seven people unanimously replied: "Executions cannot be in the military police team. It's fine at the west gate or south gate of the Kailuan mine. We still have something to say, so that the workers know how we died." The military police escorted them to the court. On the way to the court, Liu Yonglu saw with his own eyes that his companion Kong Qingbao, who could not get up because he was beaten, died. Zhou Xianhe, who had once split the labor contractor's lackey with an axe, was poisoned by the yamen servants bought by Pan Shaotang on the third day of entering the court. All those who left the hospital alive were expelled. "The dead are dead, the beggars are begging, and only I am still alive!" At this point, this resolute man, Liu Yonglu, shed tears. He choked and shouted: "Pan Shaotang, you! You have made us suffer so much!"
	A young man helped a thin and haggard woman walk closer to the stage. The young man said: "My name is Liu Zhishan, and Liu Junge was my father, who was murdered by the labor contractors. I was only three years old at that time, let my mother talk about my father's wrongful death!" Liu's mother looked to be in her forties, as if she had just recovered from a serious illness. She looked at the judge, looked at the representatives, and then looked at the enemy Pan Shaotang standing beside her. Her haggard face looked even more pale. What was she going to say? Her head drooped on her son's arm. One minute, two minutes, three minutes passed, she slowly raised her head, and immediately fell on her son's shoulder again... Representatives and spectators shed tears of sympathy. The workers whispered: "She's furious! She's furious!" The judge gave her a chair, and she sat down. After more than ten minutes, she still couldn't say a word. The old miner Sun Huaichang wiped away his tears, walked over, pointed at Pan Shaotang's face and said: "Look! You have made us suffer so much! Take a look! Take a look..." Liu Yonglu stood up and said: "Let me say it! Liu Junge was a machine craftsman in the shaft. He once led the Kailuan miners to win the struggle for year-end bonuses, and also led the struggle to borrow wages from the labor contractors; in 1936, he and Liu Yonglu and others requested continuous shifts but failed. He was arrested, and released from prison three months later, and was expelled. In 1937, the workers, again unable to maintain their lives, invited Liu Junge back from the countryside and asked him to lead the miners in the struggle. The labor contractor heard the news and immediately sent a security team member, Yuan Licheng, with three hundred yuan to bribe him, but Liu refused. Pan Shaotang said: 'If Liu Junge doesn't die, the labor contractor cannot be safe.' He and other labor contractor leaders such as Xu Yanqing and Wang Jingyi held a meeting and ordered Yuan Licheng to kill Liu. On July 25th, at 8:00 p.m., Yuan tricked Liu Junge into going to the Xinhua Cinema, and took the opportunity while Liu was in the toilet to shoot Liu to death." Liu Yonglu said here and shouted loudly: "Liu Junge died so miserably! He sacrificed himself for our workers!" Representatives and spectators wiped away hot tears.
	The old miner Sun Huaichang gritted his teeth and said: "The labor contractors ate the workers' flesh, drank the workers' blood, and finally wanted to gnaw our bones! On June 26, 1942, the Tangshan Mine's seven-lane twenty-three-lane stone gate eight-slot coal tunnel leaked yellow mud, and the sky collapsed and the earth cracked. Sand, stones, and cement rushed towards the coal workers in the mine. The yellow mud silted up to the twenty-two and a half lane stone gate, and twenty-seven workers were buried in the silt. This tragedy was caused by Pan Shaotang, who, in order to produce more coal and make more money, violated the mine regulations, violated the engineers' intentions, and forced the workers to steal coal. Twenty-seven people died, but Pan Shaotang didn't care. He forced the worker Zhang Shidang to go from the six-lane to the seven-lane to explore. Zhang Shidang had just reached the bottom of the shaft, and a blast of foul air killed him in the nine-slot coal tunnel." Zhang's wife continued to accuse: "But, Zhang Shidang's pension and the three million yuan 'relief' raised by the workers were all pocketed by Pan Shaotang." Zhang's wife said loudly: "Our people didn't come back for two days. I found you, Pan Shaotang, and asked you to give me a word, whether he was dead or alive. You said: 'Official and private matters, it's up to you!' Fellow workers, listen! My children and I have no money or power, so what can we do!? With nothing to eat or drink, I took my two children to beg for food, and later lived in the nursing home. It's been seven years now, we have no home, no money!"
	Speaking of the yellow mud leak, the workers Wang Yongshun and Gao Jingqi confirmed that: "Two days before the yellow mud leak, stone chips were already falling from the roof of the kiln, and everyone knew that there would be danger soon. We reported to you, but you ignored it. You hung the five-slot coal sign behind the mine's back and forced us to steal coal in the eight-slot." Yuan Shilu, a worker in the seven-lane, said that after the yellow mud leak, the mine bought living people to remove the mud, and it was very likely that thirty or forty more people would die. The mine distributed some wine, Rentan, and Plague-preventing Powder, although it didn't help much, Pan Shaotang even withheld these.
	The delayed payment of wages was also revealed: "During the Japanese puppet regime and the Kuomintang era, prices were doubling every day, but you never paid wages on time. You would wait until the money was worthless before giving it to us. Often, half a month's blood and sweat could only buy two catties of turnips!" Han Yonggui said that the inspectors and supervisors in the mine used to eat together. The mine bureau gave each person one and a half bags of flour per month. Pan disbanded the mess hall and gave each person one and one-third bags of flour per month, telling people to go home to eat so that he could get the leftover flour. Over the years, who knows how much flour he has exploited? In February of the thirty-sixth year of the Republic, he used the excuse that there were not enough lamps, so that out of a thousand people working, five hundred people were recorded as working half-time. This method was used for a full half year, and who knows how much money he could exploit? He got the workers' blood and sweat, and then smoked opium, patronized brothels, and squandered it at will. His young masters and young ladies were the same. In addition, he used the workers' blood and sweat to collude with bandits, secret agents, and party thugs, and squandered it with them. He sent prostitutes to the Japanese invaders, and gold bars to the bandit party Dang Xiuqing. The staff representative Gao Aiyun brought a large roll of account books, in which Pan Shaotang's collusion with the officialdom, bribery of lawyers, sending of prostitutes, and expenses for sending money were clearly written.

　　从潘绍棠看包工大柜
  　记开滦矿工在人民法院中的控诉
    本报记者  林里
    说起包工大柜，开滦矿工均以咬牙切齿地愤怒，说他们是一伙吸血鬼、吃人精；有的骂他们是爬在工人身上的一群臭虫。听了唐山人民法院在公开审讯包工巨头潘绍棠时几位矿工代表在法官面前的控诉，使我明白了这种仇恨与愤怒不是偶然的。
    过了三十八年矿井生活的刘永禄，是唐山矿万余工友选出的控诉代表之一，今年五十三岁了，他曾被包工头子潘绍棠扣押过两次：第一次是因反对包工过度剥削，遭受包工所雇佣的流氓之毒打，直到把他活活打死于一千二百英尺的井底。但当他苏醒过来之后，法院又判他坐了四十五天监狱。最使人愤怒的，还是民国二十五年那一次。那时，工人一天做八小时的工，所得工资不足维持生活，工人向潘绍棠请求做联班（即一天连续做十六个小时），潘不允，说：“工人是种怪物，不能让他吃饱，吃饱了就不给好好干活了！”并调动宪兵保安队，在一个晚上，把刘永禄等三十七人逮捕起来，说到这里，刘永禄气吁喘喘地高喊着：“把我们捆起来，你们一路走一路打枪，还威胁我们说：‘把狗×的们一个个枪毙。’可是姓刘的没有屈服啊！”三十七个人一致回答：“枪毙可不能在宪兵队里，到开滦矿西门外，或南门外都行，我们还有话说，让工人们知道我们是怎样死的。”宪兵队把他们解到法院，就在去法院的路上，刘永禄亲眼看见，被打得起不来的同伴孔庆保死了。曾用斧头劈过包工走狗的周显和，进法院的第三天，即被潘绍棠收买的差役毒害了。活着出院的，统统遭到开除。“死的死，要饭的要饭，至今活着的只我一个人了！”刘永禄这个刚毅的汉子，至此也朴哒朴哒的流下眼泪。他哽咽着高喊道：“潘绍棠，你呀！你害得我们好苦啊！”
    一位青年搀扶着一位细弱而憔悴的妇人走近台前，青年说：“我叫刘志善，刘俊阁是我父亲，被包工们谋害了。那时我才三岁，让妈说说父亲的冤死吧！”刘妈看去四十多岁，犹如重病初愈，她看看法官，看看代表，再看看站在旁边的仇人潘绍棠，憔悴的脸孔越发显得苍黄。她说什么呢？头低垂在儿子的胳膊上，一分钟，二分钟，三分钟过去了，她缓缓的抬一抬头，立刻又倒在儿子的肩膀上……。代表和观众都流下同情的泪。工友们小声的低语着：“气坏了！气坏了！”法官拿了一张椅子给她，她坐下，十几分钟之后她还是说不出一句话。老矿工孙怀昌擦干眼泪走过去，指着潘绍棠的脸说：“你看看！害的我们多苦呵！你看看呀！你看看……”刘永禄站出来说：“还是让我说吧！刘俊阁是井上里工机器匠，曾领导开滦矿工要求年终花红斗争获胜，也领导过向包工柜借支工钱的斗争；二十五年和刘永禄等要求联班未遂，遭逮捕，三个月后出狱，被开除。二十六年，工人又因生活不能维持，从农村把刘俊阁请回来，要他领着矿工斗争。包工头闻讯，立即派保安队员袁立成拿着三百块钱去贿赂，遭刘拒绝。潘绍棠说：‘刘俊阁不死，包工不能平安。’他和徐延庆、王经仪等包工首脑集议，令袁立成去杀刘。袁在七月二十五日傍晚八点钟把刘俊阁骗到新华电影院，趁刘到厕所之隙，把刘枪杀了。”刘永禄说到这里，高声喊道：“刘俊阁死的好惨啊！他是为咱们工人牺牲的啊！”代表与观众都拭着热泪。
    老矿工孙怀昌咬着牙说：“包工们吃了工人肉，喝了工人血，最后还要啃我们的骨头呀！民国三十一年六月二十六，唐山矿七道行二十三道石门八槽煤洞透了黄泥，天塌地陷一样，沙石水泥，一齐向矿井的煤工扑去，黄泥淤到二十二道半石门，二十七个工友葬身淤泥。这场惨祸，是潘绍棠为了多出煤，多赚钱，违背着矿章，违背着工程师的意图，逼迫着工友去偷煤而演成的。死了二十七个人，潘绍棠并不在意，又逼着工友张世堂从六道行下到七道行去探险，张世堂刚走到井底，哈拉气一扑，又截死在九槽煤洞里。”张妻接着控诉：“可是，张世堂的抚恤金和工友们募集的三百万元‘救济’，潘绍棠一下装起来了。”张妻大声说：“我们的人两天不见来，我找到你潘绍棠，是死是活叫你给句话，你说：官私两面，随你便！众位工友，您听听呀！俺娘儿们孩子没钱没势，可怎么办呀！？吃没吃，喝没喝，我拉着两个孩子讨吃要饭，后来才住了教养院。至今七年了，我们没有家呀，没有钱！”
    说到透黄泥，工友王永顺和高敬起证实说：“透黄泥的前两天，窑顶上已经哔哔卜卜落石片，谁都知道，不久就要出危险，向你报告，你不理，你背着矿方挂了五槽煤牌，逼着我们到八槽去偷煤。”七道行工友袁世禄说，透黄泥后，矿方买活人去除泥，很有可能再死三四十个人。矿方发了些酒、仁丹、避瘟散，虽然不顶什么事，可是潘绍棠竟也一并扣起了。
    又揭发迟发工资的情形说：“日伪和国民党时代，物价一天翻几个滚，可是，工资你没有一回按时发，多会等到钱不值钱的时候，发到我们手里，往往半个月的血汗只能买两斤萝＠吃呀！”韩永贵说，井下查头子和总管，从前是在一块吃伙食，矿局每人每月发给面粉一袋半，潘把伙食团解散，每月发给一袋又三分之一的面，叫人们回家吃饭，他好从中得剩面。这多年来，谁知道他剥削了多少面？三十六年二月间，他借口灯不够用，到一千人做工，有五百人给记半工，这个办法整整用了半年，这又谁知能够剥削多少钱？他得了工人们的血汗，便抽大烟，包窑子，任意挥霍。他的少爷小姐们也是一样。此外，他又用工人的血汗去勾结匪特党棍，和他们一起来挥霍。他给日寇七条送妓女，给匪党党秀清送金条。职员代表高霭云抱来一大卷帐本，潘绍棠勾结官场，收买律师，送妓女，送金钱的开支，都明明白白的写在帐上。
