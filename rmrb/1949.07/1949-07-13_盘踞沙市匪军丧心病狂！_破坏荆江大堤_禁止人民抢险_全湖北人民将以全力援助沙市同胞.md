　　The bandit troops entrenched in Shashi are frenzied!
  　Destroy the Jingjiang Dyke
  　Prohibit people from emergency repairs
    All the people of Hubei will fully support the people of Shashi
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 12th] The Kuomintang bandit troops entrenched in Shashi, Hubei Province, are frenziedly destroying the Jingjiang Dyke and preventing people from carrying out emergency repair work. The dyke is located between Hao Xue and Shashi and is a section of the dyke controlled by the Kuomintang bandit troops. Due to the bandits' indiscriminate excavation and destruction, and because people have not been allowed to repair and reinforce the soil since the beginning of spring, the Majiazhai dyke has collapsed by two-thirds under the impact of the Yangtze River floods in recent days. The remaining dyke, less than three meters wide, is already in a dangerous situation. If emergency repairs are not carried out immediately, the flood will break through the dyke and pour into the vast area north of the Yangtze River and south of the Xiang River, including the whole of Mianyang, Jianli, Jiangling, and Hanyang, most of Qianjiang, and part of Hanchuan. When the local people went to the dyke for emergency repairs, the Kuomintang bandit troops, disregarding the lives of two million people in the area, forbade them from doing so. After receiving this news, the Rural Water Conservancy Department of the Wuhan Military Control Commission was extremely anxious because the area had not yet been liberated and they were unable to go to repair it. Therefore, they ordered the Jianghan Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau to send an urgent telegram to the Eighth Water Conservancy Works Office, which was still in Shashi, to mobilize all the people's forces in Shashi to stop the Kuomintang bandit troops from destroying and repairing the dyke. All the people of Wuhan and the liberated people of Hubei Province will be their support.

    全湖北人民将以全力援助沙市同胞
    【新华社汉口十二日电】盘踞湖北省沙市的国民党匪军，丧心病狂地破坏荆江大堤，并阻止人民进行抢险工作。该堤处在沙市郝穴间，为国民党匪军控制的一段堤岸，由于匪军的滥加挖掘破坏，且入春以来即不准人民进行修补与培土，以至近日来在长江洪水冲激下，其中马家寨堤崩溃了三分之二，所剩不到三公尺宽的堤岸，业已险象丛生，岌岌可危，如不即刻进行抢险，大水势将破堤涌入长江以北、襄河以南，包括沔阳、监利、江陵、汉阳之全部，潜江之大部，汉川之一部的广大地区。当该地人民上堤抢险时，国民党匪军竟不顾该地区二百万人民的死活，加以禁止。武汉市军管会农村水利处得此消息后，因该地尚未解放，无法前去抢修，极为焦急，乃令江汉水利工程局发一急电，给尚在沙市之第八水利工务所，要他们动员沙市的一切人民力量，阻止国民党匪军破坏修堤的罪行，全武汉市人民与湖北省解放了的人民，将做他们的后援。
