[Ji Lu Yu Electric] The Yellow River's flood peak from Shanzhou on the 26th of this month reached Zhuquan and Liuzhuang in Nanhua County at 20:00 on the 27th. The fifth and sixth embankments of the dangerous section there had problems simultaneously. After a night of emergency repairs, the dams still hadn't overflowed. Ninety percent of the 500-plus meter revetment was submerged. The Nanhua Flood Control Headquarters, in addition to reporting the emergency to the Yellow River Commission, is leading the masses and employees along the river to desperately repair the breaches. The Yellow River Commission has ordered more than a hundred employees and technicians from the Jiangsu Dam, Gao Village, Guantai, and Kaifeng engineering teams along the river, carrying equipment, to rush to support the effort and work together on emergency protection.

[Ji Zhong Electric] Since the morning of the 25th of this month, the Hutuo River's water has surged. The northern embankment west of Langren Village in Anping breached again; leaks occurred in the Xinzhuang levee, and attempts to block them were ineffective, causing a breach of 17 zhang. Then, seven more breaches occurred in the eastern part of the levee. Under the personal command of the River Headquarters and the Anping County Head and County Committee, they simultaneously threw willow branches to protect the dam, preventing the breach from further expansion. They also mobilized the masses from villages along the river to go to the embankment, resolutely protecting the embankment and rushing to deal with the danger. Many women carried oil lamps, inspecting the embankment back and forth, with continuous lines of light. In one night, they found and blocked more than 60 leaks, finally overcoming the dangerous situation. On the 26th, the flood peak reached Wu Maoying, exceeding last year's highest water level by five decimeters. All employees and the masses worked hard to repair the five-li-long subsidiary embankment. On the 27th, the water level dropped by five decimeters, and the situation improved. Currently, the employees and masses along the river are continuing to monitor and repair the area.

[Ji Lu Yu Electric] To prevent floods and protect production, the people of the entire Ji Lu Yu area, under the leadership of governments at all levels, are actively dredging rivers and digging ditches, restoring embankments and rectifying dangerous sections. In the past six months, 28 counties in the Linhe, Huxi, Yu Bei, Yun Dong, Yun Xi, and Pu Fan special districts have completed dredging 26 rivers, including the Gan Niu River, and digging 128 diversion ditches, totaling 984,083 meters in length, equivalent to 1,476 li; excavating 4,403,827 cubic meters of earth; and using 1,612,870 labor days. They also repaired the Grand Canal embankment and rectified six dangerous sections of the Wei River, totaling 488,561 cubic meters of earthwork and 238,178 labor days. After completing this river management project, under normal rainfall conditions, 17 counties in the Yun Dong, Linhe, and Yun Xi special districts alone can protect 1,434,875 mu of low-lying land from flooding.
