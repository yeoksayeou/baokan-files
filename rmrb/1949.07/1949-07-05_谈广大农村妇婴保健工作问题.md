On the Health Care of Women and Infants in Rural Areas
　　Jing Huan

(I)

When peasants are liberated from the feudal exploitation and oppression of bureaucrats, landlords, and despots – after the thorough completion of land reform, and when peasants have obtained the means of production they deserve and their means of production can be solved and improved through diligent production, their further demand is: "Prosperity of both people and wealth," that children do not die, and adults do not get sick. (Words of a wealthy middle peasant in Ping Shan)

How can the People's Government and health workers in the countryside liberate the working masses from the suffering of disease and the threat of death? This is a very important task at present. This is a problem that has become possible and must be solved in a timely manner after land reform!

(II)

Some typical examples in the rural areas of northern Shaanxi and Jinji:

A mother in the three sides of northern Shaanxi told you with tears in her eyes: She gave birth to twelve children, and now only two daughters are left. When measles was prevalent in the three sides, a farmer's three children died one after another due to poor care. He was so anxious that he cried to the sky, to the point of not eating, not sleeping, and being too lazy to produce.

Aunt Pei gave birth to five babies, and all five died; Aunt Wu gave birth to seventeen children, only two survived, one of whom suffered from "paralysis" and hernia. –蟠龙区 investigation.

Similar examples are very common in rural areas. From many rural health surveys, it can be seen that: (1) The death rate of children is shockingly high, with an infant mortality rate of over two hundred per thousand. The disease and weakness of surviving children is also very common, which affects the production enthusiasm of farmers.

(2) The causes of death for newborns are mainly tetanus, premature birth, miscarriage, suffocation, crushing, etc., accounting for an average of 40%. This can be basically solved by improving the delivery method and improving the infant rearing method.

All this shows how urgently the health care of women and infants in rural areas needs to be improved and constructed in order to achieve the health of farmers' lives and the improvement of agricultural production. During the Anti-Japanese War and the People's Liberation War, local people's governments in various places, after local cultural and educational conferences, locally held short-term midwifery vocational schools and rural midwifery training classes, cultivated midwifery personnel, transformed old-style midwives, and universally organized epidemic prevention and medical teams to go to the countryside, which achieved some improvements. However, due to insufficient human and material resources, it has not been possible to universally establish women and child health care work.

(III)

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, on the one hand, the mortality rate of women and infants in rural areas was very high, on the other hand, a large number of doctors and midwives were concentrated in major cities across the country, and unemployment was widespread, but they could not and could not be organized to go to the countryside to solve the contradiction between unemployment and rural needs. For example, after the liberation of Jinan, according to a survey, 220 midwives were unemployed, without a livelihood, and waiting for assistance. After the liberation of Beiping, more than 70 midwives were unemployed and living at home in the unemployment registration of medical personnel, requesting work (this is only a part). Before the women and child health care system in Beiping City is thoroughly transformed, only a dozen midwives can be placed. In addition, only a dozen people voluntarily left the city to go to the countryside. Most of the rest cannot leave Beiping because of many children or their husbands' involvement. The lack of sound health institutions in counties, districts, and villages is also one of the reasons why they cannot find employment. Newly graduated midwives are already concerned about their employment issues.

The nationwide victory of the People's Liberation War is not far away. Today, when North China and Northeast China have entered or are entering production and construction, the people's demand for our People's Government to solve the problem of "children not dying and adults not getting sick!" is increasing day by day. In order to help farmers solve the problem of "prosperity of wealth but not people" and to establish rural women and child health care work, the following suggestions are put forward:

First, mobilize and organize the existing unemployed midwives and medical personnel in cities, in the form of mobile health work groups, carrying sufficient equipment and health propaganda materials, designate a regional scope, and take some time to publicize methods of women and child health care to meet the needs of the people, so as to get rid of old superstitious and unhygienic old ideas; use practical work results as teaching materials to enlighten the masses. And use everything possible to transform rural old-style midwives. At least tetanus and puerperal fever should be greatly reduced.

Second, ask rural cadres to understand the importance of this work, be determined to promote and help the progress of this work, and gradually establish primary health organizations in the county, district, and township political power institutions, and designate special funds to lay the foundation for health undertakings.

Third, health workers in various cities should cultivate primary women and child health workers as much as possible, with the basic task of learning work skills that can be applied in rural areas in a short period of time, such as midwifery technology, preventive medicine and technology, and simple medical technology, and mobilize them to go to rural health organizations to steadily and steadily establish women and child health care work.

Fourth, doctors in urban women and children's hospitals and obstetrics and gynecology departments should serve as technical supporters and work instructors for rural primary women and child health workers. The people's government's health leadership organs should also plan to train a certain number of specialized obstetrics and gynecology doctors to cooperate with this work and realize the task of urban leadership in this aspect of the countryside.

Fifth, in order to organize and mobilize unemployed midwives and medical personnel in cities to go to the countryside, it is necessary to solve their family living needs, such as short-term interest-free loans, the organization of nurseries for technical personnel, and appropriate rewards for those who work well to encourage their enthusiasm for going to the countryside.

　　谈广大农村妇婴保健工作问题
    敬桓
    （一）
    当农民从官僚、地主、恶霸的封建剥削压迫下解放出来，——土地改革彻底完成后，农民获得了应有的生产工具，生产资料可以从勤劳生产中得到解决与改善的时候，他们进一步的要求是：“人财两旺”，小孩子不死，大人不病。（平山的一个富裕中农语）
    人民政府和卫生工作者，在乡村中，如何把人民劳苦大众从疾病的痛苦与死亡的威胁中，解放出来，这是当前一个很重大的任务。这是一个在土地改革后成了可能与必须适时解决的问题！
    （二）
    陕北、晋冀乡村中，有些典型例子：
    陕北三边的一位母亲，含着辛酸的眼泪，告诉你：她生了十二个小孩子，现在只剩下二个女子。三边麻疹流行，一位农民三个小孩因为护理不好，相继病死，他急的号天大叫，以至不食不眠懒得去生产了。
    裴家婆姨，生了五个娃娃，即死了五个；吴家婆姨生了十七个儿女，只活了两个，其中一个还患着“瘫痪”和疝气症。——蟠龙区调查。
    类似这样的例子是很普遍的存在农村中。从许多农村的卫生调查中，可以看出：（一）儿童的夭亡，是惊人的多，婴儿死亡率在千分之二百以上。而生存儿童疾病衰弱也很普遍，这些对农民生产情绪是有影响的。
    （二）初生儿的死亡原因：主要是破伤风、早产、流产、窒息、压死等平均占了百分之四十，这只要改良一下接产方法与改进婴儿的抚养方法，即可获得基本解决。
    这一切说明农村中妇婴保健工作，是如何的迫切要求改善与建设，以求得农民生活健康，农业生产的提高。在抗日战争及人民解放战争中，各地人民政府于各地文教大会后曾经局部的举办短期助产职业学校，农村助产训练班，培育助产人员，改造旧式接产婆，普遍组织防疫医疗队下乡，获得了某些改善，但因人力物力的不足，还没能把妇婴卫生工作普遍的建立起来。
    （三）
    国民党反动统治时期，一方面乡村妇婴死亡率很高，一方面在全国各大城市中，却集中了一大批医生、助产士，并普遍的存在着失业问题，而没能也不可能组织起来，发动他们下乡，以解决失业与农村的需要的矛盾。例如济南解放后，据调查有二百二十个助产士失业，生活无着，等待援助。北平解放后，医务人员失业登记中就有七十多助产士失业家居，请求工作（这还只是部份的），在目前北平市妇婴保健工作制度，还未彻底改造以前，仅能按置了十几个助产士，另外自愿离开城市到乡村去的只十余人，其余多数因儿女众多，或有丈夫的牵扯，不能离开北平。县区乡村还没有健全的卫生机构，亦为不能使她们就业的原因之一。新毕业助产士，已在关切着注意她们的就业问题。
    人民解放战争全国胜利为期不远，华北东北已进入或正在进入生产建设的今天，人民要求我们人民政府给他们解决“孩子不死，大人别病！”的呼声，一天比一天高了起来。如何帮助农民来解决这个“财旺人不旺”的问题，以建立农村妇婴保健工作，谨提出如下的建议：
    第一、动员与组织城市现有失业的助产士和医务人员，以巡回卫生工作组的形式，携带足用的器材与卫生宣传用品，指定地区范围，假以时日，针对人民需要去宣传妇婴保健的方法，以祛除古老迷信不卫生的旧思想；用实际工作效果，作为教材，来启发群众。并利用一切可能改造乡村旧式接生婆。至少要使破伤风与产褥热，大大的减少。
    第二、要求乡村干部，了解这一工作的重要性，下决心来推动与帮助这一工作的进行，以及逐渐能在县区乡的政权机构中，建立初级的卫生组织，与指定专款经费，以奠定卫生事业的基础。
    第三、各城市卫生工作者尽量的培养初级妇婴保健员，以短时期学习能在农村中应用的工作技术，如助产技术，预防医学与技术，简易医疗技术为基本任务，动员到农村卫生组织中去，长期的稳步前进的建立妇婴保健工作。
    第四、城市的妇婴医院，妇婴科的医生，要作为乡村初级妇婴保健员技术上的支持者与工作中的指导者，人民政府卫生领导机关，也要有计划的培养一定数量的妇婴科专门医生，以配合这个工作，实现这一方面的城市领导乡村的任务。
    第五、为着组织与动员城市的失业助产人员与医务人员下乡，连带的要解决他们家庭生活的需要，如短期无利贷金，组织技术人员托儿所，工作好的并适当的给以奖励，以鼓舞他们下乡的情绪。（完）
