    Zhangjiakou Machine Manufacturing Factory
    Plans Too Subjective, Production Uncompleted Last Month
    [Chahar News] The Zhangjiakou Machine Manufacturing Factory largely failed to complete its production plan for June. For example, the plan to manufacture one wire winding machine was only 30% completed, and the plan to manufacture 200 hand hammers was only 40 completed... The main reason for the failure to complete the plan was subjectivism on the part of the leadership. When the factory formulated its plan last month, it did not extensively solicit the opinions of the workers and staff, and did not even consult with the foremen of each department; afterwards, the plan was not discussed among the workers and staff, the workers simply did not know there was a production plan, and the factory's Party branch and trade union were also unaware of it. When the factory summarized its work in June, it not only failed to deeply examine the subjectivism and bureaucracy of the leadership regarding this failure of the plan, but instead attributed it to objective reasons such as a lack of materials and too many temporary tasks. For the sake of construction and future work, it is hoped that the factory can further conduct self-criticism and actively carry out the democratic management movement of the factory. (Yuan Mu)

    张家口机器制造厂
    制订计划太主观上月生产未完成
    【察哈尔讯】张家口机器制造厂六月份生产计划大部未完成。如计划制造卷线机一部，仅完成百分之三十，计划制造手锤二百个，仅完成四十个……。计划未能完成的主要原因是领导上的主观主义所致。该厂上月订计划时，事先未广泛征求职工意见，甚至未与各部门工长商量；事后也未将计划在职工中进行讨论，工人根本不知道有生产计划，厂内党的支部与职工会也一无所知。该厂总结六月份工作时，对此次计划之流产，不但未能深刻检讨领导上的主观主义与官僚主义，反而推到材料缺乏，临时活多等客观原因。为了建设，为了今后的工作，希望该厂能进一步作检讨，积极开展工厂管理民主化运动。      （袁木）
