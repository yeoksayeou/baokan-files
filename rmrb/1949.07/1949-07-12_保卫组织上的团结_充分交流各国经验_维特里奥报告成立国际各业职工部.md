Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: Milan dispatch: At the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Congress held on July 7th, Vitorio, Acting Chairman of the WFTU, delivered a report on the establishment of International Trade Departments.

In his report, Vitorio emphasized: The establishment of International Trade Departments is of particularly great importance to the international trade union movement. Without trade departments, the WFTU cannot guarantee the full exchange of experiences between trade unions in various countries, and cannot guide the trade union struggles of working people in various professions, which can only be carried out on a trade basis.

Vitorio detailed how the American and British splitters, serving imperialism, had for more than three years conspired to split the unity of the world working class, hinder the establishment of trade departments, and finally withdraw from the WFTU. He then declared: Once these obstacles are removed, the WFTU will immediately and enthusiastically begin the work of establishing trade departments, and in a very short period of time, it has already achieved significant results. Four trade departments have already been established. Other trade departments will be established immediately after this Congress. By the end of 1949, twelve trade departments will be performing their duties. The WFTU is completing the establishment of its final organizational structure and is establishing the organs necessary to consolidate trade union unity.

In conclusion, Vitorio stated: The slogan of the trade departments is the slogan of this Congress: Defend organizational unity and always seek unity with all working people!

During the discussion of Vitorio's report, Gerdi, secretary of the Italian Chemical Workers' Union, and Distifenno, one of the leaders of the Seamen's Union, elaborated on the necessity of establishing trade departments for their respective industries as soon as possible. Soviet representative Yefanov said: All activities of the trade departments should conform to the goals and principles of the WFTU, which reflect the interests of all workers. Therefore, the tasks of the trade departments must proceed from the following requirements: (1) Uphold the economic and social rights of trade unions and working people; (2) Strive for better living standards and job security; (3) Limited working hours and full employment; (4) Oppose labor legislation that discriminates on the basis of race, gender, or age; (5) Fight for the implementation of a full social security system; (6) Pay wages during annual vacations; (7) Improve working conditions; (8) Promote the education and vocational training of working people. The Soviet delegation proposed the adoption of the activities of the WFTU Executive Committee and the Trade Union Secretariat in the work of establishing trade departments; and proposed authorizing the Executive Committee to prepare for convening the founding congresses of the trade departments proposed at the recent congress in the near future.

　　保卫组织上的团结
  　充分交流各国经验
    维特里奥报告成立国际各业职工部
    【新华社北平十一日电】米兰讯：在七月七日举行的世界工联代表大会上，世界工联代理主席维特里奥发表了关于成立国际各业职工部的报告。
    维特里奥在其报告中着重地说：建立国际各业职工部，对于国际职工运动有特别巨大的重要性。没有各业职工部，世界工联就不能保证各国职工会之间经验充分交流，而且不能指导各种不同职业的劳动人民的职工会斗争，而这种斗争只可能在各业的基础上进行。
    维特里奥详细追述了为帝国主义服务的美英分裂分子三年多来阴谋分裂世界工人阶级团结，阻碍各业职工部的建立，以及终于退出世界工联的经过后，宣称：等到这些阻碍一经消失，世界工联便立即热情地着手建立各业职工部的工作，而且在很短的时间内，就已获得了有重大意义的成就。四个各业职工部已经建立。其他的职工部将在本届代表大会以后立即建立起来。到一九四九年底，十二个各业职工部将执行其职务。世界工联正在完成其最后的组织机构的建立，正在设立为巩固职工会团结所必须的机关。
    维特里奥在结语中称：各业职工部的口号，就是本届代表大会的口号：保卫组织上的团结，并始终寻求与一切劳动人民的团结！
    在讨论维特里奥的报告时，意大利化学工人工会书记格尔迪和海员工会领袖之一的第斯提芬诺，在发言中阐述了从速建立各该业职工部的必要性。苏联代表叶伐诺夫说：各业职工部的全部活动，应符合反映全体工人利益的世界工联的目标与原则。因此，各业职工部的任务，必须从以下的要求出发：（一）维护职工会以及劳动人民的经济与社会权利；（二）争取较好的生活水准与职业保障；（三）有限制的工作时间与充分就业；（四）反对有种族、性别、年龄之歧视的劳工立法；（五）为实行充分之社会安全制度而斗争；（六）每年休假期间的工资照付；（七）改善工作的劳动条件；（八）促进劳动人民的教育与职业训练。苏联代表团提议通过世界工联执行委员会及工联秘书处在建立各业职工部工作上的活动；并提议授权执委会筹备在最近的将来召开建立代表大会所提出的各业职工部的成立大会。
