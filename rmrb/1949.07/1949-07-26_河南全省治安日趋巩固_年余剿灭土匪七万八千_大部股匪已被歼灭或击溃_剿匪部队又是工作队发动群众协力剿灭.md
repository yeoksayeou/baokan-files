Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 25th: The majority of major bandit gangs in Henan Province have been annihilated or defeated, and public security in the province is becoming increasingly consolidated. Henan has always been known for its strong feudal forces. At the same time, located in the Central Plains, it has repeatedly suffered from natural disasters and constant warfare, leading to hardship for the people. In particular, the Kuomintang reactionaries implemented a policy of aiding and harboring bandits, resulting in a large number of bandits in the province. Since the People's Liberation Army marched into the Central Plains, the Kuomintang bandit gangs, in an attempt to carry out a desperate struggle, sent out a large number of secret agents who, using bandit forces, relied on local tyrants and landlords as a foundation, used the Baojia system and secret societies as tools, and used local ruffians as henchmen, deceiving and threatening the masses everywhere, carrying out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. Large bandit gangs numbered in the thousands, roaming the borders between counties and districts, and in areas where our work was weaker. Scattered bandits gathered at night and dispersed in the morning, conducting covert activities, and taking advantage of various loopholes to carry out sabotage and disturbances, becoming the greatest scourge for the people of Henan Province. Over the past year, through the efforts of the Party, government, army, and people of the entire province, according to preliminary statistics, a total of 78,774 bandits have been killed, wounded, or captured, and 84 heavy machine guns, 1,443 light machine guns, 182 various cannons, 56,390 rifles and pistols, 2,510,713 rounds of ammunition, and 6,197 shells have been seized. Currently, except for a few mountainous areas in Funiu and Tongbai, and the borders between districts and counties where our strength is weaker, such as Shangzhou and Luoyang districts, where bandit gangs are still openly active, the remaining large bandit gangs of several hundred or more have been annihilated or defeated by us. Now, the vast areas of the province are basically under our complete control. The main reason for achieving this success is that the Party and government leading organs in various localities have mobilized the broad masses of the people and made the bandit suppression troops also become work teams, carrying out mass work and solving the urgent problems that the people need to solve, such as providing relief for the spring famine and protecting the summer harvest. At the same time, anti-local tyrant struggles have been carried out in rural areas, raising the people's awareness and making bandit suppression a broad mass movement. In terms of bandit suppression strategy, the policy of urban-rural coordination, military suppression combined with political offensive, and the principle of punishing the ringleaders severely, not questioning the coerced, and rewarding meritorious service were implemented, so that the bandits and secret agents who had committed numerous evils and were stubbornly unrepentant were completely isolated among the people, and the coerced elements and peasants who were forced to become bandits surrendered to the government with their weapons to repent.

　　However, the following shortcomings still exist in the bandit suppression work: First, some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the reactionary nature of bandits and secret agents and their organized and planned sabotage activities, do not understand the complexity and arduousness of the struggle against bandits and secret agents, are blindly optimistic, unwilling to carry out arduous mass work, underestimate the enemy, are careless and lax, and are not vigilant; once they encounter attacks or riots by bandits and secret agents, they are panic-stricken. Second, there have been left-leaning and right-leaning deviations in the implementation of policies. Individual areas have not implemented the policy of actively disintegrating bandit forces, but have engaged in indiscriminate beatings and killings; some areas have misunderstood the lenient policy and have not resolutely suppressed the bandit leaders, thus preventing the people from approaching us and isolating themselves. Third, the troops engaged in the suppression are not meticulous enough in their tactics, have not collected enough materials, fully understood and analyzed the enemy's situation, studied countermeasures in a timely manner, improved bandit suppression tactics, and have a sense of pride and complacency.

　　In June, the Henan Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China focused on studying the past experience of bandit suppression, determined bandit suppression as the central task of the entire Party in Henan Province at present, and called on the entire Party and army to thoroughly eliminate the bandits in Henan in the next six months. The bandit suppression work is still continuing.

　　河南全省治安日趋巩固
  　年余剿灭土匪七万八千
    大部股匪已被歼灭或击溃
    剿匪部队又是工作队发动群众协力剿灭
    【新华社开封二十五日电】河南省大部股匪已被歼灭或击溃，全省治安已日趋巩固。河南封建势力素称浓厚，同时地处中原，历来迭遭天灾，战事不断，民生困苦，特别是国民党反动派实行助匪、养匪的政策，致使该省盗匪众多。自人民解放军进军中原后，国民党匪帮为图进行垂死的顽抗，派出大批特务，利用土匪武装，以恶霸地主为基础，保甲、会门为工具，地痞流氓为爪牙，到处欺骗威胁群众，进行反革命破坏活动。大股土匪数以千计，流窜于县与县、区与区的边境以及我工作较薄弱的地区，零星散匪，夜集明散，隐蔽活动，利用各种空隙进行破坏扰乱，成为河南省人民最大的祸害。年余以来，经全省党政军民的努力清剿，据初步统计，共毙伤俘匪七八、七七四人，收缴重机枪八十四挺，轻机枪一、四四三挺，各种炮一八二门，长短枪五六、三九○枝，各种子弹二、五一○、七一三发，炮弹六、一九七发。现全省除伏牛、桐柏几个山区及我力量较薄弱的分区与分区，县与县的边境如陕州与洛阳分区等，尚有股匪公开活动外，其余数百以上的大股土匪，均被我歼灭或击溃，现在全省广大地区基本上已为我全部控制。获得这个成绩的主要原因是由于各地党政领导机关发动了广大群众，并使剿匪部队同时又成为工作队，进行群众工作，解决人民当前迫切需要解决的问题，如救济春荒，保卫夏收等。同时，各地农村中又进行了反恶霸斗争，提高人民觉悟，使剿匪成为广大的群众性运动。在剿匪的方针上，执行了城乡配合，军事清剿配合政治攻势，以及首恶必办、胁从不问、立功受奖的政策，使作恶多端、顽固不化的土匪特务在人民群众中完全孤立起来，胁从分子和被迫从匪的农民纷纷携械向政府悔过投诚。
    但在剿匪工作上尚存在以下的缺点：第一是部分干部对匪特的反动性及其有组织有计划的破坏活动认识不足，不了解对匪特斗争的复杂性与艰苦性，盲目乐观，不愿进行艰苦的群众工作，轻敌大意，麻痹松懈，不加警惕；一旦遇到匪特的袭击或暴动，即惊惶失措。第二是在执行政策上曾发生左右倾的偏向，个别地区没有执行积极瓦解土匪武装的政策，而发生乱打乱杀的现象；有些地区则对宽大政策了解错误，对匪首不坚决加以镇压，因而使人民不敢向我靠近，而使自己陷于孤立。第三是清剿的部队在战术上不够缜密，没有多方收集材料，充分了解与分析敌情，适时研究对策，提高剿匪战术，并有骄傲自满的情绪。
    六月间河南省中共党代表会议曾着重研究了过去剿匪的经验，确定剿匪为河南省全党目前中心任务，号召全党全军在今后半年内彻底肃清河南土匪。现剿匪工作仍在继续进行中。
