Victorious Crossing of the Yangtze River
Collective Creation of the Second Field Army Representatives at the Literary Congress, written by Zeng Ke and Hu Qi

Act Four

Time: 5:00 PM, April 21, 1949, at the ferry crossing on the Yangtze River east of Anqing.

(As the scene opens, military music and singing come from afar, then wave after wave of soldiers pass through the large decorated arch in front of the propaganda booth. (The arch is decorated with the large red characters "Charge Ashore!" and powerful propaganda slogans: "Salute the Heroic Assault Troops! Salute the Artillery Comrades! Salute the Civilian Laborers and Sailors!") They march across the stage:)

Forward, forward!
We are the People's Liberation Army.
……………
……………

(The propaganda team comrades are active in the propaganda booth. They personally hand cigarettes wrapped in red paper to the soldiers passing through the arch, singing songs and shouting slogans. If they see a soldier without a flower on his chest, they immediately pin one on.)

(After the military song ends, the troops continue to march. Each soldier passing the arch looks at the propaganda slogans and appears even more excited and encouraged. After a while, a propagandist dressed as a clown in red jumps out of the propaganda booth.)

Propagandist: (Sings a rhythmic ditty) (The clown leads, other propagandists follow)

Comrades, run fast, run fast, the enemy guarding the river isn't much, as long as we strike, we'll make them run, make them run!

Comrades, work hard, work hard, tonight we cross the Yangtze, tomorrow we'll have breakfast in Jiangnan, have breakfast!

Communist Party members, listen to me, be the first to cross the Yangtze, bravely killing the enemy is not enough, in emergencies, controlling the troops is key, is key!

(Artillery fire begins)

Boom, boom, boom, comrades, charge together, the enemy are cowards, we are heroes.

Artillery comrades, listen to me, the enemy is already out of ammunition, every shot hits the mark, your guns must be accurate and far-reaching! Eliminate the enemy on the riverbank! On the riverbank!

(A small team of buglers from the ranks approaches)

Bugler comrades, listen to me, tonight we cross to Jiangnan, as long as you blow the charge, not one enemy will escape!

(A group of medics approaches)

Medics with medicine kits, hurry to the wounded, perform surgery quickly, disinfect thoroughly, make contributions crossing the Yangtze.

(A group of messengers with carbines approaches)

Messengers, listen to me, remember the leaders' orders, deliver the orders clearly, completing the mission is paramount! Paramount!

(Shi Quanyi leads all six members of his squad onto the stage)

Speaking of red flowers, praising red flowers, red flowers pinned on our chests, tonight we'll sail the boat to the Jiangnan shore. Sailor heroes, everyone praises, everyone praises!

The squad leader carries a Tommy gun, it's fast and convenient to fire, the hero takes it to Jiangnan, to kill the enemy and earn glory!

A grenade is like a flower in bloom, scaring the enemy to crawl down, seize the opportunity to rush up and stab them to death with bayonets!

Bayonet, bayonet, shining bright, put you on the muzzle, tonight we'll charge to the Jiangnan shore, charging into battle, truly brave, truly brave!

Lin (singing in response): Propaganda comrades are really good, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of toil, speaking well on the Yangtze River bank, raising our spirits, charging across the shore to earn merit, welcome another round, another round.

All: Good, good, good, wonderful, wonderful, welcome propaganda comrades for another round.

Propagandist: Speaking of the Sixth Squad, praising the Sixth Squad, the Sixth Squad is a model, this preparation is really on point, life rafts, earthen boats, creating a whole bunch of these things, winning the assault mission, the beautiful name of crossing the river will be passed down for eternity, for eternity! Salute! (Jumps down)

All (applauding): Good!

Shi: Comrades, there's still a while before we cross the river, let's rest here for a bit.

Yang: Squad leader, how will our squad's battle formation be arranged today?

Shi: Haven't we said it several times already? Just like during the exercise, I'll lead with Zhang Shuanglin, Li Fugui will take three Tommy guns in the front, you and the deputy squad leader will throw explosive packs behind us, Lao Wu and Xiao Lin will carry hand grenades. The light machine gun and rifle grenade team will closely follow behind us.

Yang: Squad leader, let me take the Tommy gun, and switch with Zhang Shuanglin, I guarantee I'll be the first to land!

Zhang: I won't switch, we'll do it just like we practiced!

Yang: You're always in the front, and you don't care about anyone else!

Zhang: A squad always needs an organization, a sequence, I won't switch!

Lin: Squad leader, why do you always have me carrying hand grenades?

Wu: Yes, I'd rather throw explosive packs!

Shi: Comrades, in battle, we can't be short of anything. Explosive packs are very powerful, one blast and it takes out a large area. Without them, the Tommy guns can't advance. If the explosive packs run out and there are no hand grenades to follow up, we won't be able to resolve the battle. Anyway, we're all together in this squad, if we're going to earn merit, we'll earn it together! Does anyone have any other opinions?

Soldiers: No!

(A bugle call sounds)

Shi: Comrades, we're about to board the boat to cross the river, everyone remember our assignments on the boat, right?

All: Remember!

Shi: Who is Boat Left Number One?

Zhang: That's me!

Shi: Who is Boat Right Number Two?

Li: That's me!

Shi: Who is Boat Left Number Three?

Yang: Me!

Shi: What's your task?

Yang: Operate the boat!

Shi: What should you pay attention to?

Yang: When the boat reaches the shore, no matter how fierce the enemy's guns and cannons are, desperately crank the earthen machine!

Shi: Who is Boat Right Number Four?

Wang: That's me, the faster I crank when the boat reaches the shore, the better!

Shi: Who is Boat Left Number Five?

Lin: That's me, if the boat gets a leak, call me to fix it!

(Cheng Baihe hurries on stage)

Cheng: Report Squad Leader, there's me too, me, Number Nine, Number Nine. Don't forget about me.

Wang: Old Man Cheng, where have you been?

Cheng: Ah, I went to the Seventh Squad, Squad Leader, Deputy Squad Leader, my son Cheng Wanli has been assigned to the Seventh Squad as a sailor. I just told him that I'm Sixth Squad Number Nine, and when the order to start comes, I'll tell him to keep his boat close behind mine, don't fall behind!

Shi: Old man, do you remember where we're landing?

Cheng: Good Squad Leader, how could I not remember? Aren't we landing at Dingjiawei? Am I right?

Shi: Right!

Cheng: Good, tell me to land at Dingjiagang, and I won't be off by a single hair, guaranteed no mistakes.

Fang: Old Man Cheng, why are you wearing your new clothes today?

Cheng: Crossing the Yangtze River, this is a joyous occasion, rare to see in a hundred years. Squad Leader, if we're on the first boat, don't forget to give me a certificate of honor!

Shi: Right, I won't forget!

(Shen Da Sao comes on stage, holding a red flower, looking sad and angry)

Shen: Squad Leader, Deputy Squad Leader, please speak on my behalf, you're the ones who put me on the stage, how can you push me down when it comes to the crucial moment?

Shi: What's wrong?

Shen: The comrades of the Eighth Squad won't let me see them across the Yangtze.

Shi: Why?

Shen: I don't know what they discussed, just now when I wanted to get on the boat with them, they kept stopping me, I can't figure out what's going on!

Shi: Okay, I'll go ask them!

Wang: Squad Leader, wait a minute, why would the Eighth Squad suddenly not let her go? Maybe the comrades can all row the boat themselves, so they don't want to bother her, a woman!

Shen: No, we agreed beforehand, saying let me see you across the Yangtze. Look, I've arranged everything at home, and today I've even put on the new cloth shirt I wear when visiting relatives. Now that we're at the door, you're not calling me. Sigh, comrades, please think about it for me, yesterday you gave me a flower of honor, I'm embarrassed to wear it, aren't you throwing dirt on my face?

Cheng: Shen Da Sao, I think you should forget it, you don't need to argue, aren't the comrades thinking of you?

Shen: Old Man Cheng, things should be fair, my rowing skills are not as good as yours, or even your son's?

All: Shen Da Sao, how can you say that, today we're fighting a battle, it's not like usual.

Shen: Fighting a battle, that's why I want to see the People's Liberation Army across the river. Squad Leader, you promised me earlier, you have to keep your word, I must go today!

Shi: Deputy Squad Leader, then help her talk to the Eighth Squad.

(Old Grandma Gu comes on stage carrying a water bottle)

Gu: Ah, ah, all day long I've been rushing to see you off, by the time I got here I couldn't find you, sigh, so you've already arrived at the riverside, if I had come any later, I wouldn't have been able to see you off!

Shi: Old Grandma Gu, we're causing you trouble.

Gu: It's nothing, comrades, congratulations, congratulations on your smooth sailing and all the best! Squad Leader, you should drink some water.

Shi: Old woman, we can't drink tea today.

Gu: Huh, today you're leaving, why aren't you even drinking a sip of tea, are you unhappy with this old woman?

Shi: No, Old Grandma Gu, we're boarding the boat soon, if we drink too much tea, we'll have to urinate, the higher-ups have instructed us several times not to drink.

Gu: Oh, so that's how it is, then I won't blame you. (To Shen) Shen Da Sao, are you seeing them across the Yangtze too?

Shen: Yes, Old Grandma Gu!

Gu: Where's your Mao @?

Shen: I told him to stay at home, oh, I'm asking you to do me a favor, there's leftover rice in my cupboard, please stir-fry it for Mao @ to eat around sunset.

Gu: Don't worry, I definitely won't let your son go hungry, Da Sao, when you get to the other side of the river, please give my regards to Shen Da Ge!

(Wang comes on stage)

Wang: Shen Da Sao, I've already told them, as long as you're really not afraid, the Eighth Squad will of course welcome you to see them across.

Shen: Don't look down on me, I'm not afraid. If I was afraid, I wouldn't have come looking for you.

Shi: Shen Da Sao, that's not what we meant, don't take it to heart, you have a young child at home, we're afraid you can't leave. If you really want to go, arrange things at home, then we'll go together.

Shen (smiles): I'm happy to hear the Squad Leader say that, in that case, should I put the red flower back on?

All: Put it on, put it on!

Shen: Then I'll go to the Eighth Squad! See you in Jiangnan! (Shen and Old Grandma Gu exit)

All: See you in Jiangnan.

(A single cannon shot is heard, followed by a volley of cannon fire. Black smoke rises in patches on the opposite shore. After each volley of cannon fire, the soldiers cheer wildly, shouting: The artillery is hitting well! Good! Right on the bunkers! The majestic advance bugle call sounds again, and the people on stage stand at attention.)

Voice: Comrades, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's advance order has arrived. They order us to advance bravely. In five minutes, across the Yangtze River, thousands of miles long, two million People's Liberation Army soldiers will cross to Jiangnan. This time we have been given the glorious task of the assault, which is the result of the efforts of all our comrades. Now, the sound of the assault cannons has sounded. Remember, we can only advance, there is no retreat. Bravely charge ashore, plant the victory flag in Jiangnan, plant it on the Nanjing city wall, plant it all over China!

All Soldiers: Yes, plant the victory flag in Jiangnan, plant it on the Nanjing city wall, plant it all over China!

(Amidst applause, military music, bugle calls, and cannon fire, a soldier carrying a red flag presents it to the Sixth Squad. The singing and cannon fire continue, and the advancing troops move towards the riverbank. The military band, playing the advance march, heads up the river embankment. After a short pause, fireworks and colored signal flares slowly rise from the opposite shore.)

　　胜利渡过扬子江
    文代会二野代表集体创作  曾克、胡奇执笔
  　第四场
    一九四九年四月二十一日下午五时，在安庆东边的江岸渡口处。开幕时，军乐声，歌声自远而近，接着一队队战士经过鼓动棚前的大彩门（彩门上饰以红色大字：“冲上岸去”，并竖起有力的鼓动标语牌：向突击英雄致敬，向炮兵同志致敬，向民工水手致敬！），穿场而过：
    前进，前进！
    我们是人民解放军。
    ……………
    ……………
    （文工团的宣传员同志，活跃在鼓动棚里，他们把用红纸封好的香烟，亲自递给通过彩门的战士，唱着歌，呼着口号，看见那个战士胸前没有花，马上给他们补戴上去。）
    军歌声告一段落后，队伍行列仍继续着，每个走过彩棚的战士，看着鼓动标语，都显出更加兴奋鼓舞。一会，一个穿红衣，扮着小丑模样的宣传员从鼓动棚中跳出来。
    宣：（唱快板）（化装人主唱，其他宣传员和）。
    同志们，快快跑，快快跑，守江敌人没多少，只要我们打过去，包他一个跑不了，跑不了！
    同志们，加油干，加油干，今天晚上渡长江，明天江南吃早饭，吃早饭！
    共产党员听我言，强渡长江要当先，勇敢杀敌还不算，紧急情况掌握部队是关键，是关键！
    （炮声起）
    炮声轰轰轰，同志们，齐冲锋，敌人是孬种，咱们是英雄。
    炮兵同志们听我言，敌人已经不沾弦（先），弹弹命中不落空，炮要打的准又远！消灭敌人在江边！在江边！
    （部队行列里来一小队司号员）
    司号员同志听我言，咱们今晚过江南，只要你们吹起冲锋号，敌人一个跑不了！
    （行列里来了一伙卫生员）
    卫生员挂药包，赶上前去救彩号，手术要做快，消毒要做好，打过长江立功劳。
    （来了一伙持卡宾枪的通讯员）
    通讯员，听我言，首长命令记心间，命令要传清，完成任务最当先！最当先！
    （史全义领六班全体战士上）
    说红花，道红花，红花红花胸前挂，今晚把船开到江南岸。水手英雄人人夸，人人夸！
    班长挎的汤姆枪，打的又快又便当，英雄带他到江南，杀敌立功真荣光！
    手榴弹出手一朵花，敌人吓的忙爬下，趁此机会冲上去，再用刺刀扎死他！
    刺刀刺刀明晃晃，把你放在枪口上，今晚冲到江南岸，冲锋陷阵真勇敢，真勇敢！
    林（接唱）：宣传员同志真正好，不怕苦，不怕劳，长江岸上说一套，说得我们情绪高，冲过对岸立功劳，欢迎再给来一套，来一套。
    众：好好好，妙妙妙，欢迎宣传员同志再来一套。
    宣：说六班，道六班，六班本来是模范，这次准备可是沾，救生架，土轮船，这个那个创造一大摊，突击任务争取到，渡江美名万古传，万古传！敬礼！（跳下）
    众（鼓掌）：好哇！
    史：同志们，渡江时间还有一会儿，大家先在这里歇一歇。
    杨：班长，今天咱们班战斗队形怎么排？
    史：不是说过好几次了，还是照演习时候那样，我领着张双林，李富贵带三支汤姆枪在头里，你同副班长在我们后边扔炸药包，老吴同小林挎手溜弹。轻机枪同枪溜弹组紧跟我们背后。
    杨：班长，我拿汤姆枪，就跟张双林换一换吧，我保险第一个登岸！
    张：我不换，怎么练习的，就怎么干＠！
    杨：你总在头里，就不管一管别人啦！
    张：一个班总要有一个组织，一个先后，我不换！
    林：班长，你怎么光叫我提手溜弹呢？
    吴：是呀，我愿意扔炸药包！
    史：同志们，打仗＠，什么也不能短，炸药包威力可大，一炸一大片，没有他汤姆枪就发展不了，要是炸药打完了，后边没手溜弹接上气，也解决不了战斗，反正咱们班在一起，要立功，咱们一起立功！大家还有什么意见没有？
    战士们：没有了！
    （一支号角声起）
    史：同志们，马上就要渡江上船了，我们船上分工，大家记清了吧？
    众：记清了！
    史：船左一号是谁？
    张：是我！
    史：船右二号是谁？
    李：是我！
    史：船左三号是谁？
    杨：我！
    史：什么任务？
    杨：开船？
    史：注意什么？
    杨：船靠岸的时候，不管敌人枪炮打的多么厉害，拼命的摇土机器！
    史：船右四号是谁？
    王：是我，船靠岸时摇的越快越好！
    史：船左五号是谁？
    林：是我，船给打漏了，找我补！
    （程百合匆匆跑上）
    程：报告班长，还有我，还有我这个九号，九号。你不要忘了。
    王：程大爷，你到那里去啦？
    程：啊呀，我到七班去啊，班长，副班长，我儿子程万里派到第七班当水手了，刚才我告诉他了，说我是六班第九号，要是等一声号令开动了，我叫他的船要紧跟在我后边，可别落了后！
    史：老人家我们在那里登岸，记住了没有？
    程：好班长呀，我怎么没记住呢，不是在丁家位登岸吗？可对不对？
    史：对！
    程：好哇，叫我在丁家岗登岸，我一分一毫也不差，保险不出错。
    方：程大爷，你怎么今天把新衣服也穿上呢？
    程：过长江＠，这是喜事儿，百年也难遇这一回。班长，要是我们是第一船，你可别忘了给我发光荣证呀！
    史：对，我忘不了！
    （沈大嫂上，手里拿一朵红花，丧眉苦脸，象在生气）
    沈：班长，副班长，叫大家伙儿替我说说吧，是你们把我抬举上台的，怎么事到关口上，又把我推下来呢？
    史：怎么啦？
    沈：你们八班同志不让我送他们过长江。
    史：为什么？
    沈：我也不知道他们怎么商议的，刚才我要跟他们上船，他们老往前拦我，我也摸不清是什么门！
    史：好，我问问他们去！
    王：班长，慢点，八班怎么平空又不让她去呢，怕是同志们自己都会划船，这才不愿再麻烦她这个女人家了！
    沈：不成，事先说好了＠，说让我送你们过长江，看，我把家里事安排的一停二当，今天，把我走亲戚穿的新布衫都穿上了，事到门户前，你们又不叫了。唉，同志呀，你们替我想想吧，昨天你们给我发的光荣花，我也不好意思带了，你们这不是往我脸上抹黑灰吗？
    程：沈大嫂，我看算了，你也不用得争，同志们还不是为你想的？
    沈：程大爷，人办事总要公平，我划船把式不如你老人家，还不如你儿子啦？
    众：沈大嫂，看你说那儿去了，今天要打仗，不是平常。
    沈：打仗，我就为这才要送解放军过江，班长，是你早答应我的，说话可要算数，我今天一定要去！
    史：副班长，那你帮她到八班说说吧。
    （古老奶奶提水壶上）
    古：啊呀，啊呀，一天到晚都慌着送你们，到时候了我可找不着了，唉，原来你们早到了江边上了，我要是再晚来一步，可不是送不了你们啦？
    史：古老奶奶，我们在这里可麻烦你老人家了。
    古：好说咧，同志，恭喜你们，恭喜你们一帆风顺，万事如意！班长，你们快喝水吧。
    史：老人家，今天我们可不能喝茶。
    古：咦，今天你们要走了，怎么连茶也不喝一口，是不高兴我这个老婆子了吗？
    史：不是，古老奶奶，一会就上船，茶喝多了要撒尿，上级嘱咐好几次了，不叫喝。
    古：哦，原来是这样，那我就不怪你们了。（对沈）沈大嫂，你也送他们过长江？
    沈：是呀，古老奶奶！
    古：你毛＠呢？
    沈：我叫他留在家里了，哦，我拜托你老人家一件事，我家碗柜里有剩饭，到半晚夕你替我炒炒叫毛＠吃。
    古：你放心，一定饿不着你儿子，大嫂，你要到了江那岸，会到沈大哥可给我问个好！
    （王上）
    王：沈大嫂，我给你说好了，只要你真不害怕，八班当然欢迎你送他们过去。
    沈：你们不要门缝里看人，把我瞧扁了。我要怕，我就不找着了来。
    史：沈大嫂，不是这个意思，你别多心，你家里有小孩，怕你离不开。你一定要去，把家安排好了，那就一块过吧。
    沈（笑了）：班长说了这话，我还高兴听，既这样，那我把红花再戴上吧？
    众：戴上吧，戴上吧！
    沈：那我就到八班去了！江南见吧！（沈与古老奶下）
    众：江南见。
    （单炮声响了一阵，接着是排炮，对岸黑烟一片片升起，每一阵排炮声后，就是战士们的发狂般欢呼，叫喊：炮兵打的好！好！正揍到地堡上！雄壮的进军号又一次起，台上人肃立。）
    声：同志们，毛主席和朱总司令的进军号令已经来了，他们命令我们奋勇前进，五分钟以后，在纵长千里的长江上，二百万人民解放军就要打过江南去，这次我们担任了光荣的突击任务，是我们全体同志努力得来的，现在，突击的炮声响了，记住，我们只有前进，没有后退，勇猛的冲上岸去，把胜利的红旗插到江南，插到南京城头，插遍全中国！
    全体战士：对，把胜利红旗，插到江南，插到南京城头，插遍全中国！
    （在掌声，军乐号声，炮声中，一个战士扛着一面红旗授予第六班，歌声炮声连续，进军行列向江岸抵进。军乐队吹着进军号拥上江堤。少停，对岸烟火和彩色信号弹徐徐升起。）
