[Jizhong Electric] The state-owned Jizhong Transportation Company has made significant progress in its operations over the past year, completing enormous support-the-front tasks and facilitating the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. The company was established in April of last year and consists of three major teams—automobile, cart, and shipping—as well as twelve transportation stations and cart and boat repair factories, with a total of over one thousand workers and cadres. During the battles to liberate Tianjin, Chahar South, Baoding North, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Laiyuan, the support carts, calculated by single cart, totaled more than 50,000 days, carrying over 39 million catties of military supplies, with the number of support carts accounting for 42 percent of the total number of carts dispatched throughout the year. After the liberation of North China, the company shifted to operating passenger and freight transportation, with significant development. This March, the transportation stations were reduced from twelve small stations in Xinji and other places to seven, and Baoding and Tianjin offices were added. Railway and river transportation were linked together, and transshipment warehouses were organized, offering agency services for buying and selling, receiving and dispatching, package transport, transshipment, combined transport, and warehouse management, forming a vertical and horizontal transportation network. In the course of operation, the transportation stations united 3,200 mass professional and sideline carts and 265 boats. Throughout the year, the stations and teams completed a total of over 238.54 million catties of work and material transportation and 34,661 passengers. The business area is gradually expanding. In the course of operation, the creativity of the workers has also been brought into play. The automobile team converted automobiles into wood-burning vehicles and can produce dozens of parts such as blowers and oxygen tubes. The steel cylinder was reduced by one and a half catties, and the flower pot was reduced by twenty catties. Workers in the shipping team made their own wooden bells and three-way joints. The rubber repair factory imitated belt patching. After the management meeting in December last year, a unified accounting system was established. Funds were changed from being managed by each team and station to being managed by the company in a unified manner. Each unit maintains the integrity of transportation equipment, ensures that material accounts match inventory, and reports sales and disposals on schedule. A system of responsibility for dedicated vehicles and boats has been established, a preliminary accounting system has been established, and the company is gradually moving towards enterprise management. However, there are still major problems in the current work, namely, political work is lagging behind. Some problems among the employees cannot be resolved in a timely manner, resulting in employees' enthusiasm not being consistently full. Some units have extravagant staffing, wasting manpower. Operational management is not strict enough, boats sometimes return empty or are idle, factories often waste materials, and some raw materials purchased are not suitable, resulting in the accumulation of funds. In the future, we must vigorously implement enterprise management and democratic management; in major transportation routes and busy transportation areas, we must vigorously organize mass transportation and combine it with state-owned transportation capacity. Under the principle of taking into account the appropriate interests of both industry and commerce and the transportation industry, and common development, we must correctly grasp the freight rate policy to ensure the smooth flow of materials, so as to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy.

　　冀中国营运输业发展
    联结水路陆路广集车辆船只组纵横运输网代客包运转运
    【冀中电】国营冀中运输公司经营年余，业务有重大开展，完成巨大支前任务，便利了城乡物资交流。该公司成立于去年四月，共辖汽车、大车、航运三个大队及运输栈十二处，附有大车船只修理厂，全体工人、干部共千余名。在解放平津、察南、保北、太原、张家口、大同、涞源战役中，支前大车按单车计算，共五万多天，载运军需品三千九百余万斤，支前车数占全年总发车数的百分之四十二。华北解放后，即转入经营客货运输，且有很大开展。今年三月间运输栈由辛集等十二处小站缩减到七处，增加了保定办事处和天津办事处，将铁路、河路等运输联结在一起，组织转运货栈，代客买卖、代客收发、包运、转运、联运、仓库包管的种种方式，构成纵横交织的运输网。经营当中，各处运货栈共团结了群众专业车和副业车三千二百辆，船二百六十五只。全年总计各栈队共完成工料运输两亿三千八百五十四万余斤，客运三万四千六百六十一人。营业面积逐渐扩大。经营过程中，工人的创造性也得到发扬，汽车队把汽车改装木柴车，并能配制吹风机、氧气管子等零件数十种，钢筒减轻一斤半，花盆减轻二十斤，航运队工人自造木铃铛、三转子；胶皮修理厂仿造皮带烫补，去年十二月经营会议后，统一了会计制度。资金由各队栈各自经营改为公司统一掌握。各单位保持运输工具的健全，掌握材料帐库相符，存销按期报结。树立了专车专船负责制，初步树立了核算制度，逐步走向企业化。但目前工作中尚存在如下主要问题，即政工工作跟不上去。职工中有的问题不能及时解决，致职工情绪不能经常饱满；有的单位编制铺张，浪费人力；经营管理不够严格，船只有时空返或停顿，工厂常废工料，购买原料有的不适用，积压资金。今后要大力贯彻经营企业化与管理民主化；在主要交通路线及运输繁忙地区，大力组织群众运输，使其与国营运输力相结合。在照顾工商业与运输业双方适当利益、共同发展的原则下，正确掌握运价政策，使物资畅通，以达发展生产、繁荣经济之目的。
