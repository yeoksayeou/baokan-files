Wang Ruiji, a representative from the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot who attended the Northeast Railway Labor Model Conference, meticulously researched and manufactured welding rods based on his experience in manufacturing welding rods in the Northeast after returning. The riveters in the riveting group also actively assisted, and they have now succeeded. Initially, waste opium pipe heads were cut into small strips and used as welding rods. Then, 1.5 kilograms of water, 0.9 kilograms of yellow soil, 0.3 kilograms of water glue, and 0.3 kilograms of black lead powder were placed in a pot and heated to boiling, while stirring with a stick to mix evenly. Then, the cut small strips were immersed in the solution for three or four seconds, taken out and dried by fire. The test results showed that due to the small amount of materials and improper mixing, the temperature was too high and too thin when dipping the medicine, so it could not be fully attached to the iron strips. After dipping, the medicine attached to the iron strips cracked and easily fell off after being dried by fire, so it was not successful. In the second experiment, the amount of materials used was doubled and properly mixed. When dipping the medicine, the temperature of the solution was lowered and dipped after it solidified, so that the medicine was fully attached to the welding rod. After dipping, it was allowed to dry naturally in the shade. Then, it was used to weld locomotive boilers and large and small smoke pipes. After many tests, the results were good, saving materials, saving labor, and greatly increasing efficiency. Currently, the locomotive depot has manufactured 7.6 kilograms, with a total value of 315 yuan for water glue and black lead powder. The unit price of each kilogram of welding rod is 450 yuan. After deducting the material costs, a total of 3,105 yuan was saved.

    制成电焊条
    张家口机务段出席东北铁路劳模大会的代表王瑞纪同志，归来后根据东北制造电焊条的经验，精心钻研制造。铆工组工友亦积极协助，现已获成功。开始时，将废大烟管头切成小条，常做电焊条，然后将水一·五公斤、黄土○·九公斤、水胶○·三公斤、黑铅粉○·三公斤，置于锅中加热，使其沸腾，同时用棒搅合，使其均匀混合，然后将切成的小条浸于溶液中，经三、四秒钟取出用火烤干，试验结果，因材料较少，配合不适当，蘸药时温度高，太稀，不能充分挂于铁条上，蘸完后用火烤干，铁条上所附之药开裂，易于掉下，因而没有成功。第二次试验时，所用的材料增加了一倍，适当调合，蘸药时待溶液之温度降低，凝结后再蘸，使药充分挂于焊条上，蘸完后使其自然阴干，遂用它去烧焊机车锅炉及大小烟管，经过多次试验，成绩良好，省料、省工、效力大。现机务段制造了七·六公斤，用水胶黑铅粉共值三百一十五元，电焊条每公斤的单价是四百五十元，除去材料费外，共节省三千一百零五元。
