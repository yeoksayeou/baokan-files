Tianjin Dispatch: Tianjin Department Store's retail department, after days of preparation, officially opened on the 7th. Its main task is to supply urban workers, students, office staff, and citizens with daily necessities. After the opening of the retail department, the company will also send people to Shanghai to directly order goods from various public and private factories in Shanghai or establish a Tianjin general distribution relationship. As for the wholesale prices of goods, they will be determined based on production costs and market transaction prices, but when necessary, they will also be lowered as much as possible to stabilize commodity prices. The company is divided into three major departments: a department store (retail department), a wholesale department, and a production and procurement department (the latter two departments started operating as early as April), and also has an amusement park attached.

　　津市百货公司
  　增设门市部
    【天津电】天津市百货公司门市部，经多日筹备，已于七日正式开幕。其主要任务在供给城市工人、学生、机关职员、市民的日用必需品。门市部开幕后，该公司并将派人驻沪，直接从上海各公私营工厂订货或建立津总经销关系。至货物之批发价格，则根据生产成本和市场成交价格决定，但遇必要时，亦将尽量压低，以收平稳物价之效。该公司共分三大部：百货商场（门市部）、批发部及生产采购部（后两部早于四月间开始营业），另外附设游艺场一所。
