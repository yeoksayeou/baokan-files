Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 22nd - The short commentaries published by this agency on June 25th, entitled "Eliminate Complacency and Suppress Special Agents and Bandits" and "Protect the People's and the Motherland's Property," have aroused great attention within a certain corps of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army. The expanded Party Committee of the corps convened a meeting a few days ago to discuss the above two documents. During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that this is the main direction of our Party's current efforts and must be implemented throughout the entire Party and army. To this end, the Party Committee of the corps specifically calls on all Party organizations in the corps to implement the following two matters:

\t1. Immediately overcome the tendency of complacency and underestimation of the enemy. Every commander and fighter in the entire army should raise vigilance and eliminate the activities of special agents and bandits. All Party members and cadres must be clear-headed and calm, actively consolidate unity with the masses, not be afraid of hardship, stand firm on the position of revolutionary soldiers, and not be subject to any threats or inducements.

\t2. Universally strengthen ideological education in the troops, establish a concept of protecting the people's and the motherland's property, enhance revolutionary responsibility, thoroughly implement and safeguard the Party's policies, prevent fires from occurring in areas and cities where the troops are stationed, mobilize the entire army to cherish horses, oppose waste and corruption, earnestly implement the instructions of the Central China Bureau and the Fourth Field Army's Front Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on saving grain, and ensure that not a single bullet or shell is wasted in combat. Regularly sun and inspect ammunition to prevent it from becoming damp and damaged.

The expanded Party Committee meeting finally decided to reorganize and strengthen the organization of the security departments and the secrecy committee, establish mass anti-espionage and anti-special work, further consolidate the troops, organize cadres for special study, and conduct in-depth reviews in connection with the past.

    四野某兵团党委会讨论贯彻新华社短评精神
    【新华社汉口二十二日电】本社于六月二十五日发表的题为“消灭麻痹倾向扑灭特务匪徒”和“保护人民祖国的财产”的短评，已在人民解放军第四野战军某兵团中引起重大注意，该兵团中共扩大党委会于日前开会讨论上述两文件。在讨论中大家一致认为这是我党当前主要努力的方向，必须在全党全军中贯彻实现。为此，该兵团党委会特号召全兵团党的组织，贯彻执行以下两件事情：
    一、立即克服麻痹轻敌的倾向。全军每个指战员都应提高警惕，消灭特务、匪徒的活动。全体党员干部，必须清醒镇定，积极巩固与群众的团结，不怕艰苦，站稳革命军人的立场，不受任何威胁与利诱。
    二、普遍加强部队的思想教育，树立保护人民祖国财产的观念，提高革命责任心，彻底执行与维护党的政策，防止在部队驻扎的地区和城市发生火警，发动全军爱护马匹，反对浪费贪污，认真执行华中局和第四野战军中共前线委员会关于节约粮食的指示，并要作到在战斗中不浪费一粒子弹和一颗炮弹。平日勤晒勤检查，以免使弹药潮湿和损坏。
    党委扩大会最后决定要把保卫部门和保密委员会的组织，重新健全与充实起来，建立起群众性的防奸肃特工作，进一步巩固部队，并组织干部进行专门学习，并联系过去作深刻的检讨。
