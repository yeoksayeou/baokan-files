Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: TASS, Helsinki reports: The Second Congress of the Finnish People's Democratic League was held from June 28th to July 1st at the "Workers' House" in Helsinki.  Three hundred and four representatives of the league's 140,000 members participated.

    The Chairman of the Finnish Communist Party, Aaltonen, extended congratulations to the Congress on behalf of the Finnish Communist Party, saying: "At present, when the capitalist world is facing a new economic crisis and attempting to find a way out through new wars, all progressive forces in Finland especially need cooperation and unity. No force in the world can stop the progress of the progressive forces in Finland, and the progressive forces in Finland are growing stronger and stronger. The Communist Party has given and will continue to give all support and cooperation to the work of the Finnish People's Democratic League."

    The Congress unanimously decided to pay tribute to the Soviet government. The Congress adopted the basic program of the league and the report on the current situation by the league's chairman, Kuulo. The resolution stated: Finland's situation can only be alleviated by strengthening and further promoting economic relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Establishing close friendly relations with the Soviet Union is the main prerequisite for this kind of economic link. The criminal policy of the current right-wing Social Democratic government in Finland has led to a significant deterioration in Soviet-Finnish relations recently. The Fagerholm government and the Finnish bourgeoisie's attempt to overcome the current economic difficulties by lowering the living standards of the working people is doomed to failure.

    The Congress called for strengthening the unity of the labor movement, vehemently criticized the divisive policies of the right-wing Social Democratic leaders, and strongly protested against the persecution of progressives and workers by the Fagerholm government. The Congress called on the Finnish people to stop policies that endanger Finland's independence and worsen Finland's relations with its great neighbor, the Soviet Union. The Congress re-elected the leadership of the Finnish People's Democratic League. Kuulo was re-elected as the chairman of the league, Talvio was elected as the chairman of the executive committee, and Gerda Antti was elected as the general secretary.

　　芬兰人民民主联盟　举行二届代表大会
    大会决议加强苏芬经济关系
    【新华社北平五日电】据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：芬兰人民民主联盟第二届代表大会，于六月二十八日至七月一日在赫尔辛基“工人之家”举行。参加者有该盟十四万会员的三百零四名代表。
    芬兰共产党主席亚尔托宁代表芬共向大会致贺说：“在现在，当资本主义世界面临着新的经济危机并企图从新战争中寻找出路的时候，芬兰一切进步力量尤需合作与团结。世界上没有任何力量能阻止芬兰进步力量前进，芬兰进步力量正日益强大和增长中。共产党在给予而且将继续给予芬兰人民民主联盟的工作以一切支持与合作。”
    大会一致决定向苏联政府致敬。大会通过该联盟的基本纲领和该联盟主席库洛关于当前形势的报告。决议称：只有加强并进一步促进对苏联与人民民主国家的经济关系，芬兰的情况才能缓和。与苏联建立密切的友谊关系，是这种经济联系的主要的先决条件。芬兰现任右翼社会民主党政府的罪恶政策使近来苏芬关系明显地恶化了。法吉荷尔姆政府与芬兰资产阶级，以降低劳动人民生活水平来克服目前经济困难的企图，是注定要失败的。
    大会呼吁加强劳工运动的团结，猛烈抨击右翼社会民主党领袖的分裂政策，并强烈抗议法吉荷尔姆政府对进步分子和工人的迫害。大会号召芬兰人民阻止危害芬兰独立并使芬兰与其伟大邻邦苏联关系恶化的政策。大会改选了芬兰人民民主联盟的各领导机构。库洛连任该联盟主席，塔尔维奥当选执行局主席，格尔单·安尼当选总书记。
