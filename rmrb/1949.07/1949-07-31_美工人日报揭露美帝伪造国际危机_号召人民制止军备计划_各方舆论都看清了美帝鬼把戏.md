Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 31st: TASS, New York, 28th: Many commentators with differing political views believe that the US government will stir up a fabricated panic about the international situation, and may even create artificial international crises, in order to induce Congress to pass Truman's foreign arms bill. These commentators believe that, given that initial comments from Congress show that even enthusiastic "Cold War" supporters like Vandenberg have some doubts and hesitations about Truman's proposals, the government is even more likely to use the aforementioned means.

American Broadcasting Corporation's broadcast commentator, Yaglonsky, commented on the foreign arms bill, saying: Many congressmen mentioned Dulles's speech in the Senate, in which he said: The US representatives at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference had considered keeping the American people in a state of "artificial panic" in order to maintain tensions between the East and West. Yaglonsky pointed out: Some congressmen suspect that a new "artificial panic" is being planned to persuade Congress to accept the government's armament plan.

The National Council of Arts, Sciences, and Professions—whose members include many of the most famous American writers, artists, educators, and other cultural figures—issued a statement to the press, making the same warning more explicitly. The committee claimed that the Truman administration would create artificial crises to force Congress to pass arms appropriations. The government's entire foreign policy is based on fabricated panic and artificial crises.

　　美工人日报揭露美帝伪造国际危机
  　号召人民制止军备计划
    各方舆论都看清了美帝鬼把戏
    【新华社北平三十一日电】塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：许多政治观点不同的评论员相信：美国政府将掀起国际形势的伪造的惊慌，甚至可能制造人为的国际危机，以诱使国会通过杜鲁门的武装外国法案。这些评论员认为：鉴于国会的首次评论显示，甚至象范登堡一流支持“冷战”最热心的议员，都对杜鲁门的建议存在着一些怀疑和犹豫，政府利用前面所说的那些手段就更有可能。
    美国广播公司的广播评论员亚葛朗斯基评论武装外国法案称：许多议员提起杜勒斯在参院的讲演，其中说：巴黎外长会议的美国代表，曾考虑使美国人民继续处于“人为惊慌”的状态中，以保持东西双方的紧张局面的问题。亚葛朗斯基指出：有些议员怀疑这种新的“人为惊慌”是否正在策划中，以便说服国会接受政府的武装计划。
    艺术、科学与自由职业全国委员会——它的会员中有许多最有名的美国作家、艺术家、教育家及其他文化界人士——向报界发表声明，更明白地提出同样的警告。委员会声称：杜鲁门政府将制造人为的危机，以迫使国会通过武装拨款。政府的全部外交政策建立在伪造的惊慌和人为的危机上。
