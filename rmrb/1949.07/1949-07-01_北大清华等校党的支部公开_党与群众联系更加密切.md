The open Party branches at Peking University, Tsinghua University, and other schools bring the Party and the masses closer together

[Report from this newspaper] Since the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee solemnly instructed that all Party branches and members in factories, schools, and government offices should be made public, the Party branches of Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yanjing University, Normal University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Art College, and the Institute of Iron and Steel Technology have successively opened since the 27th. The lists of Communist Party members, including students, professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, staff, and workers, have been posted on the democratic walls of each school, and have been warmly received and valued by the vast number of teachers, students, workers, and police. Standing on the position of cherishing and trusting the Party, they have criticized the shortcomings of past work, and expressed the hope that Party members will strengthen the connection between the Party and the masses in the future, and that Party members will take the lead and set an example in study and work.

In the two or three days since the Party was made public at Peking University, teachers, staff, and students have been discussing this issue everywhere on campus. They have also raised various questions to Party members, such as "probationary Party members," "the tasks of the branch," "conditions for joining the Party," and "how to join the Party." Some professors at Tsinghua University braved the rain to see the list, and students surrounded the list and discussed, "This is a list that Kuomintang secret agents tried every means to get their hands on but couldn't." They felt that the Party's covert work during the Kuomintang reactionary rule was very necessary and very successful, and they admired the current openness. They said, "The Communist Party puts the Party in front of the masses and under supervision in this way, which makes it easier to maintain the Party's combat effectiveness and purity." Students from Normal University and Fu Jen Catholic University, who were used to seeing the rampant behavior of Kuomintang secret agents on campus in the past, now see the list of Communist Party members made public, and the masses can make criticisms and suggestions to the Party, and Party members listen humbly and consider the opinions of the masses. If it is right, it is right; if it is wrong, it is wrong; if there is a fault, it will be corrected. From this matter alone, it can be seen that Communist Party members and Kuomintang Party members are fundamentally different. Some professors and students also said, "Looking at the Communist Party members, they are all outstanding individuals." A student from the Department of Chemistry at Fu Jen Catholic University was happy to see that there were eight Party members in his department and said, "The Chemistry Department is really great!" Students from the Institute of Iron and Steel Technology believed that if the Party had been made public earlier, the work and study in the school would have been done better in the past. Students from various schools expressed their admiration for the spirit of Party members who devoted themselves to the revolution at the risk of being persecuted at any time. They deeply felt that it was not easy to be a Communist Party member. A student from the Department of Civil Engineering at Tsinghua University said, "I must follow the Communist Party in the future!" Another student added, "Following is not enough, we must run to keep up!" This shows his eagerness to follow the CCP.

Professors and students from various schools have also expressed many opinions to the Party with great concern. A student from Peking University said, "In the future, if we find that Party members are not active and do not get close to the masses, we can criticize them." Some students even asked the General Branch of Peking University to print the list of Party members and distribute it to all students so that they could give suggestions at any time. Ni Genshan, a student from Yanjing University, said, "Party members and the masses must maintain good contact." An associate professor from the Department of Physics at Normal University said, "The hope of the new China mainly rests on the Communist Party. I hope that Party members will not affect the Party's reputation with their personal improprieties." Chu Shenglin, director of the Department of Physics at Yanjing University, hoped that the nature of the Party would be explained more in the future so that everyone could understand. Some students from Tsinghua University and Yanjing University believed that the decisions of the Party branch were often correct, but some Party members were somewhat mechanical when implementing them and lacked the ability to persuade. They hoped that more attention would be paid to this in the future. Many students and workers also believed that Communist Party members were synonymous with good. A worker from Yanjing University said, "Bian Baojun used to have a very spoiled young master's temper, but he changed later and was very kind to us workers. We thought he probably joined the Communist Party, and it turned out to be true!" Regarding individual Party members with great shortcomings and poor work styles, they all reflected, "This person is not worthy!" A student from Tsinghua University said, "Fortunately, there are only a few, otherwise the Communist Party will really be ruined." Therefore, Party members who usually have shortcomings are now determined to study hard, correct their shortcomings, and work hard.

Since the general student Party members of various schools sacrificed some of their studies before liberation in order to unite and organize everyone to carry out the anti-American and anti-Chiang struggle, professors and students are now very concerned about the Party members' studies. Students from Yanjing University said, "I hope that Party members can also play an exemplary role in their studies." Duan Xuefu, director of the Department of Mathematics at Tsinghua University, said, "The two Party members in Mathematics I are not doing very well in their studies and need to pay attention to this!" When a student from Normal University pointed out that individual Party members were not studying well, another student defended him, saying, "The struggle in the cracks is very difficult. How can they take care of their studies? Let's see what happens in the future."

This is a fair statement. When our Party was still under the bloody rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and was carrying out a resolute struggle against the enemy, some Party members sacrificed a part of their studies for the sake of revolutionary work, and sacrificed their own interests for the sake of revolutionary interests. This is a glorious virtue, not a shortcoming. It was easy to not miss classes at that time, but it was difficult to sacrifice one's studies for the revolution and be prepared to sacrifice everything. Now the situation has changed, and the work should be done in a way that does not hinder learning. In fact, many Party members who had fallen behind in their studies after liberation have made up for it. Some Party members in Yanjing University and Tsinghua University have played an exemplary role in this review.

In order to further strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses and accept the supervision of the masses, the Party's general branches or branches have decided to invite representatives from teachers and students to attend the branch meetings in the future in order to listen to their opinions and improve their work.

### 北大清华等校党的支部公开　党与群众联系更加密切

　　北大清华等校党的支部公开
  　党与群众联系更加密切
    【本报讯】自中共北平市委此次郑重指示各工厂、学校、机关等党的支部和党员一律公开后，北大、清华、燕京、师大、辅仁、艺专、铁院等大学支部已于二十七日起先后公开，各校共产党员包括学生、教授、讲助教、职员、工友的名单，已分别贴在各校民主墙上，受到了广大师生工警的热爱与重视。他们并站在爱护和信任党的立场上，对过去的工作缺点提出了批评，并希望今后党员要加强党与群众联系，党员们在学习及工作中要起带头及模范作用。
    北大自党公开后两三日来，校内到处听见教职员和学生讨论着这一问题。并纷纷向党员提出了各种问题，如“候补党员”，“支部任务”，“入党条件”，“怎样入党”等。清华有些教授冒雨赶去看名单，学生们围着名单纷纷议论说：“这就是国民党特务千方百计弄不到手的一张名单”。他们觉得党在国民党反动派统治时期的隐蔽工作做得十分必要和十分成功，对于现在的公开，感到佩服。他们说：“共产党这样把党放在群众面前和监督下，更容易保持中共的党的战斗性与纯洁性”。师大和辅仁的同学在以前见惯了校内国民党特务的横行霸道，现在看到中共党员的名单公开，群众可以向党提出批评和意见，而且党员则虚心地倾听并考虑群众的意见，是则是，非则非，有过则改，就从这件事上也可以看到共产党员和国民党员是根本不同的。也有些教授同学说：“看看共产党员都是些优秀分子”。辅大化学系一位同学看到本系有八个党员，高兴地说：“化学系真棒”！铁院的同学则认为如果党公开得更早一些，则过去学校中的工作和学习会搞得更好。各校同学对于党员在随时可能遭到迫害下献身于革命的精神都表示钦佩，他们深深感到做一个共产党员的不容易。清华土木系一位同学说：“以后一定要跟着共产党走”！另一位接着说：“走已跟不上了，要跟着跑”！显示了他对于追随中共的急切的心理。
    各校的教授同学又都十分关心地对党提出了很多意见。北大一位同学说：“以后发现党员不积极，不和群众接近，就可以批评他了”。有些同学甚至要求北大总支部将党员的名单油印出来发给全体同学，以便能随时提意见。燕大倪艮山同学说：“党员和群众一定要联系好”。师大物理系一位副教授说：“新中国的希望主要寄托在共产党，希望党员不要以个人的不检点影响了党的声誉。”燕大物理系主任褚圣麟则希望以后要多多解释党的性质，使大家了解。清华、燕京有些同学认为党支部的决定常常是正确的，但有些党员在执行时有些机械，没有说服能力，希望以后多加注意。很多同学工人又认为共产党员就是好的代名词，燕大一位工友说：“边宝骏以前少爷的脾气很大，后来变了，对我们工友可好，我们就想他大概加入了共产党，果然是”！对于个别缺点很大、作风不好的党员都反映说：“这个人不大配”！清华一位同学说：“幸好只是少数，否则真要把共产党弄糟了”。因此平时有缺点的党员现在都下决心要好好学习与改正缺点，努力工作。
    由于各校一般学生党员在解放前为了团结和组织大家进行反美蒋的斗争，牺牲了自己的若干功课，因此现在教授和同学们都十分关怀党员的功课，燕大同学说：“希望党员们在学习中也能起模范作用”。清华数学系主任段学复说：“数一的两个党员功课都不太好，要好好注意”！师大一个同学指摘个别党员功课学习不好时，另一个同学代为辩护说：“夹缝里的斗争好艰苦，如何顾得了功课？且看以后吧”。
    这话是说得公平的。当着我们的党还处在国共党反动派的血腥统治下向敌人进行坚决的斗争时，一些党员为了革命的工作，牺牲一部分些课，为了革命利益牺牲自己的利益，乃是光荣的美德，并不是缺点。那时不误功课是轻而易举的，为革命而牺牲自己的功课，并准备牺牲自己的一切，倒是困难的。现在情况变了，工作应该力求不妨碍学习。事实上，解放后许多党员落课都已补上了，燕京、清华两校有些党员在这次温课中都起了模范作用。
    为了更亲密党和群众的关系，接受群众的监督，各民党总支部或支部已决定今后将邀请师长、同学派代表出席支部大会，以便听取意见，更好改进工作。  （金凤）
