　　【Tangshan Telegram】The Jidong Branch of the People's Bank has been carrying out loan business. Since May, it has focused on supporting small and medium-sized industries to expand production and solve the difficulties of funds and raw materials during the off-season production. As of the end of May, the number of loan customers has reached 112, and the average daily balance of bank loans in late May was more than 80 million yuan in Renminbi. Among them, public enterprises accounted for 72.6%, and private enterprises accounted for 27.4%. The loan customers include ceramics, cotton ginning, papermaking, ironworking, oil pressing and other industries, including more than 70 ceramic enterprises, with loans of more than 11 million yuan. In early June, the number of loan customers gradually increased, with a total loan of more than 36 million yuan, and the average balance increased by 34% compared with the end of last month. Most of this loan was used to purchase raw materials and expand production; the ceramic industry is in the off-season, and sales in Tianjin, Beijing, and rural areas are not smooth, so more loans are used to pay wages. After Quanjin Crockery Bureau obtained a loan, it produced one more kiln of goods this month (three kilns in May, four kilns in June), and stored the goods in preparation for large-scale sales in the autumn. After Fuxingcheng Iron Factory obtained a loan, it purchased 100 tons of pig iron and expanded its production plan for June. Other companies such as Xinsheng Electric Iron Factory and Wanhe Iron Factory also used loans to purchase pig iron from the Northeast and Qinhuangdao to manufacture waterwheels, diesel engines, and other components.

　　冀东人民银行发放工贷
  　陶瓷等业获得生产资金
    【唐山电】人民银行冀东分行开展贷款业务，五月以来，有重点地扶植中小工业扩大生产，并解决其淡月生产中资金、原料的困难。截至五月底，贷款户已达一百十二户，五月下旬银行贷款余额每日平均为人民币八千余万元。其中公营企业占百分之七十二点六；私营占百分之二十七点四。贷款户包括有陶瓷、轧花、造纸、铁工、榨油等行业，其中陶瓷业七十余家，贷款一千一百余万元。六月上旬贷款户逐步增多，共贷出三千六百余万元，平均余额较上月底增加百分之三十四。此项货款大部用于购置原料和扩大生产；陶瓷业因系淡月，平津及农村的销路不畅，贷款开支工资的较多。全信缸局获得贷款后，本月份即增出一窑货（五月份出三窑，六月份出四窑），存货准备秋后大量推销。复兴成铁工厂获得贷款后，即购入生铁一百吨，扩大了六月份的生产计划。其他如新生电气铁工厂，万合铁工厂等，也都运用贷款到东北、秦皇岛购买生铁，制造水车、柴油机及其他机件。
