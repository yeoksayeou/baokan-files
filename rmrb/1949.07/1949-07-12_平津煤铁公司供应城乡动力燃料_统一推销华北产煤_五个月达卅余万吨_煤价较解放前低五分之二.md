    Pingjin Coal and Iron Company Supplies Urban and Rural Power Fuel
    Unified Promotion of Coal Produced in North China
    Over 300,000 Tons in Five Months
    Coal Prices 40% Lower Than Before Liberation
    To unify and systematically promote coal production in the entire North China region, avoid competition among coal mines in sales, and systematically and reliably supply power to public and private factories in North China, as well as fuel for urban residents and the vast rural areas, the North China Trade Corporation established the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company after the liberation of Pingjin. This company covers the entire North China region and enables the Yangquan and Jingxing coal mines on the Zhengtai Railway Line, the Mentougou coal mine on the Pinghan Railway Line, the Tangshan and Great Wall coal mines on the Beining Railway Line, and the Datong and Xiayuan coal mines on the Pingsui Railway Line to mutually adjust and rationally solve production and sales problems based on their different outputs, types, production costs, sales distances, and prices under the overall leadership and planning of the company's business. Due to the heavy responsibilities of the company, the organizational structure is also relatively large to adapt to the tasks. The company now has branches in Beijing, Qinhuangdao, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, and the Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company (now merged with and under the leadership of the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company). The original branches in Yangquan, Jingxing, Dezhou, Taiyuan, and other places have several sub-branches and offices to directly maintain close contact with local urban and rural cooperatives and vigorously supply coal. Its business scope includes major and medium-sized cities and parts of rural areas in North China, extending west to Taiyuan, east to Qinhuangdao, north to Zhangjiakou and Datong, and south to Jinan.

    In the five months since its establishment, the company has made significant achievements in business development. First, when Beijing and Tianjin were just liberated, the company ensured the rapid resumption of work in state-owned industries in the two cities under difficult transportation conditions. In particular, the Jibei Electric Power Company in both cities did not feel any panic about coal, thus ensuring the supply of electricity to industry and the vast majority of citizens. The largest cotton mill in Tianjin, with the highest coal demand, was also unaffected by coal shortages at the beginning of liberation, and its huge spinning machines continued to operate without interruption. The company also guaranteed the supply of fuel to the garrison troops around Tianjin and 60-70% of the residents in Beijing and Tianjin. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in Beijing and Tianjin, many small-scale national industries in the two cities were forced to shut down due to the extreme difficulty in supplying fuel. Now they have regained their original power, and most of them have resumed work. Not only has the coal supply been resolved, but also coal prices have been lowered. For example, the price of coal produced in Mentougou is 40% cheaper per ton than before liberation (before liberation, one ton of coal could be exchanged for two and a half bags of flour, but now it only exchanges for one bag and a bit more).

    The supply of coal in rural areas has also gradually developed. However, due to the company's recent establishment, the lack of cadres, the still uncommon establishment of cooperatives and promotion societies in various places, and the limitation of transportation difficulties, coal cannot be universally distributed to every corner of the countryside. According to statistics for the past five months, more than 300,000 tons of coal from the Yangquan and Jingxing mines have been supplied to most of central Hebei, southern Hebei, part of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and a small part of Taihang and Taiyue areas, as well as urban industries.

    In addition to supplying North China's needs
    Also supplies East and Central China
    In addition to supplying a large amount of coal to the North China region, the company is now actively planning to transport coal to the East China and Central China liberated areas and the newly liberated major cities in the south of the Yangtze River, such as Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, for industrial use. According to the company's June statistics, 30,000 tons of Kailuan coal have been sold to Hankou in Central China; 18,000 tons of Kailuan coal have been sold to Qingdao in East China. The company has also established contact with industrial departments in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou to ensure that large quantities of coal produced in North China will be transported south to meet their urgent needs. However, the dying Kuomintang reactionaries have blockaded maritime transportation, preventing more than one million tons of coal stockpiled in North China from being smoothly transported to major cities in the south of the Yangtze River. This is only a matter of time, and transportation difficulties will soon be resolved with the victory of the whole country.

    Because the company comprehensively and vigorously controls the needs of the market supply, it has partially solved the sales problem for various mines; it has also partially solved the problems of mine expenditures and employee living conditions caused by poor sales. For example, Kailuan Mine has difficulty selling coal. Before and after liberation, the mine owed its employees three months' worth of wages, amounting to 500,000 bags of flour. The mine could not pay wages, making it difficult for employees to maintain their livelihood. To this end, the Coal and Iron Company exchanged employee coal tickets for 30,000 bags of flour, 50,000 bolts of foreign cloth, and 25 million RMB in February, solving the employees' livelihood problems. This has made the mine workers appreciate the care and concern of the Communist Party and the People's Government for them. In April and May, the company allocated 1.4 million pit props, over 30 million jin of corn flour, 14 million jin of coarse grains, and 87,000 bags of white flour to the Kailuan Mining Bureau in exchange for coal, not only solving the employees' livelihood but also solving the mine's shortage of pit props. Since June, the company has supplied the equivalent of 200,000 bags of flour in kind each month in exchange for mine coal, guaranteeing the employees' livelihoods and helping them sell their products. By now, the employees of the mine have begun to improve their enthusiasm for production after the difficulties in their lives have been partially resolved. In addition, the company acquired 3,000 tons of coal from the Great Wall Mine, solving the employee's livelihood problem.

    Eliminate Blind Promotion and Waste
    Specifically Divide Sales Areas for Each Mine
    According to the company's June statistics, the coal mines under contract include Yangquan, Jingxing, and Mentougou mines. Kailuan mine coal is acquired in large quantities. A total of more than 500,000 tons has been purchased in May. Some coal from the Great Wall and Xiayuan mines has also been sold; Datong coal is only sufficient for local needs and has not been shipped out for sale. According to the company's plan, based on the different output, quality, and distance from Beijing and Tianjin of each mine, certain sales markets will be divided for each mine to eliminate the huge waste of human and material resources in blind promotion and transportation and to eliminate the phenomenon of mutual market competition that was cultivated during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is now principally determined that the coal from Yangquan (producing nearly 40,000 tons per month) and Jingxing (producing nearly 40,000 tons per month) mines will be mainly sold to small and medium-sized cities and rural areas along the Zhengtai and Shide roads, and the large coal from the two mines will be transported to Beijing and Tianjin for industrial use. Mentougou (average monthly production of 100,000 tons) will supply the needs of citizens and rural areas in the Beijing-Tianjin-Baoding triangle, and also supply the needs of Shanghai citizens. Coal from Datong (monthly production of over 20,000 tons) and Xiayuan (monthly production of over 10,000 tons) mines will mainly supply the needs of small and medium-sized cities and rural areas along the Pingsui line; Kailuan (average monthly production of over 300,000 tons) and Great Wall (over 5,000 tons) mines will mainly supply Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Hankou, and Qingdao, supplemented by North China. In the future, coal sales will vigorously develop business according to their planned scope.

    Problems that need to be solved urgently
    Organic combination of production, transportation, and sales is needed
    The company's business is developing day by day, but there are still some problems that need to be solved urgently due to the lack of cadres and various conditions. First of all, the company cannot currently achieve an organic combination of production, transportation, and sales, and the organizational structure also needs to be reasonably adjusted. For example, each mine is under the unified leadership of the Enterprise Department, while coal sales are led by the Coal and Iron Company of the China Trade Corporation under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; the connection between the two in business often forms uncoordinated and inconsistent phenomena. Therefore, difficulties have repeatedly occurred in guaranteeing the quality of coal sales and controlling prices. For example, the Mentougou coal mine should have produced more fine coal in the spring (this coal has a large market in the spring) to expand broad sales, but the mine produced more raw coal (not suitable for sales in the spring), resulting in slow sales. Furthermore, some mines only focus on improving production efficiency, but the quality of coal is relatively reduced. For example, Yangquan Mine originally determined that large and medium coal each accounted for 40%, and mixed coal accounted for only 20%. However, the mine increased the production of mixed coal to 70% and reduced large and medium coal to 30%. Because mixed coal does not sell well in the market, marketers feel it is difficult to promote. In transportation, the company also feels that the Pingjin Road and Zhengtai Road cannot provide coal cars in a timely manner, resulting in the accumulation of coal production and reduced sales volume. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, it is not possible to transport coal in a timely manner according to market supply and demand, so an uncoordinated phenomenon occurs between production, transportation, and sales. To effectively solve this contradiction, the three must establish close contact with each other. Secondly, there is currently the problem of difficulty in coal sales. On the one hand, this is because North China's coal production is surplus, and in addition to self-sufficiency, most of it must be exported, but maritime transportation is currently blockaded by the Kuomintang reactionaries, making it difficult to transport south; on the other hand, the region is now in the rainy season, making land transportation inconvenient, which happens to be the off-season for coal sales. Therefore, the company currently has a lot of coal in stock, making it impossible for funds to circulate quickly. Although this problem is only a matter of time, it is currently also a problem that needs to be solved urgently.

　　平津煤铁公司供应城乡动力燃料
    统一推销华北产煤
  　五个月达卅余万吨
    煤价较解放前低五分之二
    【本报特讯】为统一与有计划地推销全华北的产煤，避免各煤矿推销的竞争，并有计划、有保证地供应全华北公私营工厂的动力和城市市民与广大农村的燃料之用，华北贸总特于平津解放后成立了带有全华北性的平津煤铁公司，使正太铁路线上的阳泉、井陉煤矿，平汉线上的门头沟煤矿，北宁线上的唐山、长城煤矿及平绥线上的大同、下花园煤矿，都能依其产量的不同，种类的不同，成本高低的不同，销售远近的不同以及价格高低的不同等差别，在该公司业务总的领导与计划下，互相调剂，合理地解决各矿生产与销路问题。由于该公司任务的繁重，为适应任务的组织机构亦较广大，现该公司下设有北平、秦皇岛、保定、张家口等分公司及正太煤铁公司（现与平津煤铁公司合并受其领导），原属阳泉、井陉、德州、太原等地各分公司下又设支公司及办事处数个，以便直接与当地城乡的合作社取得密切联系，大力供煤。其经营范围包括西至太原，东至秦皇岛，北至张家口，大同，南至济南等诸大中城市及华北的部分农村。
    该公司在建立后的五个月中，业务的开展是获得了显著成绩的。首先平津两地刚解放时，该公司在运输困难的条件下保证了两市国营工业的迅速复工，尤以两地的冀北电力公司丝毫没感到煤的恐慌，从而确保了工业上与广大市民之电的供应。天津市的规模最大，需煤量最多的中纺纱厂在解放初亦没受煤的影响，巨大的纺纱机不间断地转动起来。该公司并保障了津市周围的驻军及平津两地百分之六、七十的市民的燃料的供应。在国民党反动派统治平津时，两地小型的民族工业因燃料供应的极端困难停工休业了很多，现重获得了原动力，大多数都复工了。不但煤的供应已获解决，而且煤价也降低了。如门头沟出产的煤其价格较解放前每吨合计便宜百分之四十（解放前每吨煤可换二袋半面粉，现只换一袋多）。
    煤在农村的供应也逐渐地开展起来了。但由于该公司尚是初建，干部的缺乏以及各地合作社、推进社的建立尚不普遍，再加以运输上困难的限制，煤还不可能普遍地深入到农村的每个角落。据五个月来的统计，阳泉、井陉两矿的煤供应到冀中的大部、冀南、冀鲁豫的一部及太行、太岳的少部地区及城市工业的煤计三十余万吨。
  　除供华北需要外
  　并供华东华中
    该公司除大量地供给华北地区煤的需用外，现正积极筹划运往华东、华中两解放区及解放不久的京、沪、杭等江南诸大城市，以供工业需用。据该公司六月份的统计，已售华中的汉口开滦煤三万吨；售与华东青岛开滦煤一万八千吨。现该公司并与京、沪、杭各市工业部门均取得联系，保证今后大批华北的产煤源源南运，供给其迫切的需要。但垂死挣扎的国民党反动派竟封锁海运交通，致华北百万吨以上的存煤，不能顺利地运往江南诸大城市去。这只是个时间问题，不久运输上的困难将会随着全国的胜利而获解决的。
    由于该公司掌握全面地、大力地供应市场的需要，因而，使各矿部分地解决了销路问题；也部分解决了因销路不好而引起的矿方开支与职工生活待遇问题。如开滦矿煤销路是困难的。解放前后矿方曾欠职工三个月的工资面粉达五十万袋，矿方不能发工资，致使职工生活几难维持。为此，煤铁公司于二月份以三万袋面粉，五万匹洋布及二千五百万人民币换取职工煤票，解决了职工的生活问题。使该矿职工已经体贴到共产党、人民政府对他们的爱护与关怀。四、五月份该公司又拨给开滦矿务局窑木一百四十万根，和玉米面三千余万斤，粗粮一千四百万斤，白面八万七千袋换取矿煤，不但解决了职工的生活，而且解决矿方窑木缺乏困难问题。自六月份起，该公司每月供给相等于二十万袋的面粉实物以换取矿煤，保证职工的生活，帮助其推销产品。至此，该矿职工在生活上的困难得到部分解决后，生产情绪已开始提高。此外，该公司又收购了长城矿煤三千吨，解决了职工生活问题。
  　杜绝盲目推销与浪费
  　特划各矿销售地区
    据该公司六月份的统计，包销的煤矿计有阳泉、井陉、门头沟三矿，开滦矿煤是大批的收购，五月来共收购五十余万吨，长城、下花园矿煤也销售一部分；大同煤只够当地需要，尚没运出代销。根据该公司的计划是以其各矿的产量、质量和距离平津远近的不同，划分各矿的一定销售市场，杜绝盲目推销与盲目运销上的人力物力的巨大浪费，消灭各矿间在国民党反动派统治时代养成的互相争夺市场的现象。现原则上确定阳泉（每月产近四万吨）井陉（每月产近四万余吨）两矿之煤主要销售于正太路、石德路沿线的中小城市及农村用，两矿的大炭煤运销平津，供工业上的需用。门头沟（每月平均产十万吨）除供给平、津、保三角地市民与农村需用外，尚可供给上海市民需要。大同（每月产二万余吨）下花园（月产一万余吨）两矿煤主要是供给平绥沿线的中小城市与农村用；开滦（月产量平均三十余万吨）长城（五千余吨）两矿煤则以供应京、沪、杭、汉、青为主，供华北为辅。今后煤的销售将依其规划范围大力地开展业务。
  　急待解决的问题
  　产运销应有机结合
    该公司的业务是日益发展着的，但目前因干部的缺乏及各种条件的限制，尚存在一些问题是急待解决的。首先该公司在产、运、销三者目前尚不能达到有机的结合，组织机构亦需合理调整。如各矿是由企业部统一领导的，而煤的推销是工商部所属华贸之煤铁公司领导的；二者在业务上的连系往往形成不协调和不一致的现象。因此，在煤推销上质量的保证上与价格的掌握上均有困难迭次发生。譬如门头沟煤矿在春季本应多产末煤（此煤在春季销路大），以开展广阔的销路，但该矿却生产原煤多（春天不适合销路），致销售迟滞。再者，有些矿只顾生产效率提高，煤的质量却相对降低，如阳泉矿原确定生产大中煤各占百分之四十，混煤只占百分之二十。但该矿将混煤提高生产额为百分之七十，大、中煤降低为百分之三十。由于混煤在市场上销售不畅，使推销者感到推销困难。在运输上该公司亦感到平津路及正太路不能及时的供给车皮，使产煤堆积，销售量减少。因运输的不便，不能根据市场的供求关系，及时运输，因此产、运、销三者之间即发生不协调的现象。为有效地解决此一矛盾，三者必须互相取得密切联系才可。其次，目前存在煤的销路困难问题，这一方面是由于华北煤产过剩，除自给外，必须输出大部，但目前海运被国民党反动派封锁，致南运尚感困难；另一方面，本区内现已届雨季，陆运不便，恰至煤的销售的淡月。因此，该公司现存煤很多，使得资金不能迅速流转。虽然这一问题只待时间而已，但目前亦是急待解决的问题。
