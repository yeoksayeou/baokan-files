Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 11th: TASS, Prague, July 10th: According to a report from the Electric Communications Agency correspondent in Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party has recently issued a statement regarding the Japanese peace treaty issue. The statement includes the detailed plan for the peace treaty made by the JCP Central Committee plenary session on June 19th. The Japanese Communist Party takes the Potsdam Declaration and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission as the basis for this plan. The JCP demands the punishment of war criminals, the destruction of war potential, the unlimited development of peaceful industries, the establishment of trade relations with all countries, and the achievement of complete national independence. The statement points out: "The biggest obstacle to realizing this peace plan is the Yoshida Cabinet. This cabinet, which sacrifices the masses to ensure that monopoly capital obtains excessive profits, can only lead Japan to lose its economic and national independence." The statement warns that all of this will lead peace-loving people to distrust Japan when it emphasizes that the ruling Democratic Liberal Party openly calls for an anti-communist movement and points out that fascism is becoming more rampant domestically. The statement further indicates that the Yoshida Cabinet has made some "absurd" remarks regarding Japan's future status. The statement cites Yoshida's remarks as an example, in which Yoshida advocated extending the occupation period of foreign troops stationed in Japan. Yoshida expressed doubts about whether Japan can maintain permanent neutrality. The statement concludes: "As the vanguard of the masses, we will fight to overthrow Yoshida's traitorous and reactionary cabinet."

　　关于对日和约问题
  　日共发表声明
  　要求严惩战犯毁灭战争潜力
    【新华社北平十一日电】塔斯社布拉格十日讯：据电通社驻东京记者报道：日本共产党顷发表关于对日和约问题的声明。声明包括六月十九日日共中央全会所作的关于对日和约的详细计划。日本共产党将波茨坦宣言、远东委员会的决议，作为该计划的基础。日共要求惩办战犯，毁灭战争潜力，无限地发展和平工业，与各国建立贸易关系，要求达成国家的完全独立。声明指出：“实现这一和平计划的最大障碍是吉田内阁。这个以牺牲群众来保证垄断资本获得超额利润的内阁，只能使日本导向丧失其经济与民族的独立”。声明于强调当权的民主自由党公开号召反共运动并指出法西斯主义在国内变得更为猖狂时，警告称，所有这些，将导向使爱好和平的人民对日本的不信任。声明进一步指明，吉田内阁对于日本的未来地位已作了某些“荒诞的”谈话。该声明举出吉田的谈话为例，吉田在谈话中主张延长驻日外国军队的占领期限。吉田对日本能否保持永久中立表示怀疑。声明最后称：“作为群众的先锋队，我们将为推翻吉田的卖国反动内阁而奋斗”。
