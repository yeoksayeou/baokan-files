　　【Suiyuan Electric】The Suiyuan Provincial Party Committee's city work conference opened on July 16 and concluded on July 21. The conference determined to support handicraft industries that are beneficial to agriculture and to guide the market to facilitate farmers' transactions in the city. The conference discussed the nature, role, and future work of small and medium-sized cities in eastern Suiyuan. Modern industry is underdeveloped in these small and medium-sized cities, with only a few light industries such as flour, printing, and egg processing. Judging from the residents' occupations, capital usage, and import and export situations, the proportion of handicraft workers is also small. They are basically consumer-oriented, playing the role of material distribution centers, and are heavily dependent on rural areas and large cities. Therefore, future work should first focus on supporting and developing all handicraft industries that are beneficial to agriculture, such as blacksmithing, woodworking, and bag making, and helping them solve difficulties in capital, raw materials, and sales. In particular, it is necessary to promote the organization of supply and marketing cooperatives to open up sales channels and unify the procurement of raw materials. State-owned factories must be further enterprise-oriented, implement democratic management, and adopt a production increase and frugality dividend system to encourage production increases and reduce costs. Second, private factories should fully implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital; industries with no development prospects, such as the jewelry and paper-crafting industries, should be helped to switch industries as soon as possible. Third, attention should be paid to guiding the market, restricting speculative activities, smuggling, and illegal activities that disrupt finance. Standardize weights and measures (foot, peck, scale), open up various markets, protect free trade, and provide farmers and legitimate merchants with the convenience of buying and selling goods, such as establishing farmer reception stations and other institutions. The past malpractices of chambers of commerce, such as private apportionment, corruption, and waste, must be eliminated, and unnecessary corvée labor must be reduced; the main task of the chamber of commerce should be to unite merchants, understand market conditions, and implement laws and policies. Fourth, vigorously organize supply and marketing cooperatives and small production cooperatives. This type of cooperation can solve the difficulties of capital and tools and promote cooperation and mutual assistance in labor and technology. Fifth, strengthen urban public security work, establish worker pickets, and transform vagrants and beggars. Sixth, strengthen municipal institutions and enhance the leadership of municipal work. Based on the characteristics of urban concentration, transform the organizational form and working methods of urban areas to facilitate contact with citizens and implement government orders. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen urban publicity and reporting work.

　　发展有利农业的手工业
  　绥远城工会议确定中小城市工作方针
    【绥远电】绥远省委召开的城市工作会议于七月十六日开幕，二十一日结束。会议确定扶植有利农业的手工业，并指导市场便利农民进城交易。会上讨论了绥东各中小城市的性质、作用及今后的工作。这些中小城市中近代化工业不发达，只有少数面粉、印刷、打蛋等轻工业。从居民的职业、资本使用与出入口等情况看，手工业工人所占的比重也小，基本上是消费性的，起集散物资的作用，对农村及大城市的依赖性较大。因此，今后工作，首先应扶植与发展一切有利于农业的手工业，如打铁、木工、口袋等，帮助他们解决资本、原料、销路等困难，特别要提倡组织供销合作社，以便打开销路、统一采购原料。公营工厂须进一步企业化，实行民主管理；采用增产节约分红制，以鼓励增产，减低成本。其次，私营工厂应全力贯彻劳资两利政策；没有发展前途的行业，如首饰业、纸扎业等，应及早帮助转业。第三、注意指导市场，限制投机，走私，捣乱金融等犯法行为。统一度量衡（尺、斗、秤），开辟各种市场，保护自由贸易，给农民及正当商人以买卖货物的便利，如开设农民招待栈等机构。过去商会的私自摊派，贪污浪费等弊端，必须革除，不必要的工差必须减去；商会主要任务应是团结商人，了解市场情况，贯彻法令政策。第四、大力组织供销合作社，及小型生产合作社，这种合作可以解决资本及工具的困难，发挥劳力及技术上合作互助。第五、加强城市治安工作，建立工人纠察队，改造游民、乞丐等。第六、充贯市政机构，加强市政工作的领导。根据城市集中的特点，改造市区的组织形式和工作方法，以求更便于联系市民，贯彻政令。此外须加强城市的宣传报导工作。
