　　The Basic Goals of the Struggle of the Two Peoples are Consistent, Creating an Inseparable International Friendship
    General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party Sends Congratulatory Message to the CPC on its Anniversary
  　Chairman Mao Replies with Thanks
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 21st] Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China recently received a congratulatory message from Blas Roca, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party in Central America, on the 28th anniversary of the founding of the CPC. Chairman Mao Zedong replied with a message of thanks today. Blas Roca's telegram is as follows:
    To Comrade Mao Zedong, Beijing, China:
    In the name of the socialist working people of the vanguard of the Republic of Cuba, we extend our respects on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, as Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhu De lead the war against the traitorous Kuomintang to achieve great and unparalleled victory. Because the lofty Chinese people, following the socialist line and achieving liberation, have inspired all nations seeking liberation and longing for world peace and socialist practice; especially the Cuban people and the People's Socialist Party are greatly excited by the struggle against the world's reactionary center and the oppressor of our nation, American imperialism. Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the heroic Communist Party of China!
    General Secretary Blas Roca
    Chairman Mao Zedong's reply is as follows:
    Comrade Blas Roca:
    Thank you for your congratulations on the 28th anniversary of the Communist Party of China. China and Cuba are two countries that are far apart, but the basic goals of the struggle of the two peoples are indeed consistent. This situation has created an inseparable international friendship between the two peoples, just like the international friendship of the proletarians and working people of all countries in the world. I wish the brave Cuban people and the Cuban People's Socialist Party victory in the struggle against American imperialist aggression! I wish the common cause of the people of all countries in the world against American imperialism victory!
