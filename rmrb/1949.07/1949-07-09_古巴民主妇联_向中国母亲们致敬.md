(Ping City News) The All-China Democratic Women's Federation yesterday received a letter of salute to Chinese mothers from the Cuban Democratic Women's Federation, passed at the Mother's Day (May 8th) celebration. The letter first praised the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, saying: "The victory of the Chinese people's strength, like a giant star, appears in the world. The huge fortress of Chiang Kai-shek's feudal military regime collapsed in the face of the people's strength. China's glorious democratic fighters have opened up a new path for Chinese women, especially Chinese mothers." The letter expressed fervent admiration and "saluted those mothers who gave their sons for the liberation of the motherland," calling Chinese mothers "simple yet great, humble yet heroic Chinese mothers." Signed by: Garcia Borja, President of the Cuban Democratic Women's Federation.
