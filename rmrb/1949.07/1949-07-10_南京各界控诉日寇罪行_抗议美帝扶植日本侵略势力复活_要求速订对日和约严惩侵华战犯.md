Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 9th. People from all walks of life in Nanjing, commemorating the 12th anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident, have strongly accused the Japanese invaders of their bloody atrocities in Nanjing, protesting against the U.S. imperialist policy of supporting the revival of Japanese aggressive forces, and demanding the swift conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan and severe punishment of Japanese war criminals who invaded China. A reporter interviewed several citizens on the 6th who personally experienced the terror of the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese invaders. They had all gone to the International Tribunal in Tokyo in 1947 to testify, but due to the U.S. imperialists and the Kuomintang's traitorous and reactionary government's protection of Japanese war criminals, their efforts were fruitless, and they returned home in disappointment and indignation. Chen Fubao, a clerk at the Tongchang Hardware Store on Zhonghua Road in Nanjing, testified at the Tokyo International Tribunal about two things: first, on December 12, 1937, when the Japanese invaders entered Nanjing, he witnessed two female compatriots being raped to death by a group of Japanese soldiers at No. 7, Xinkai Road. Second, after the Japanese invaders occupied Nanjing, they forcibly entered the refugee zone established by the International Committee, dragged out more than 300 young men sheltered in the refugee zone and shot them, while many women were raped. He said: These crimes were committed by the Japanese war criminal Nakajima Go, but Nakajima Go was released back to Japan by the Kuomintang reactionary government after the victory against Japan. Wang Chongde, who was a policeman in Nanjing in 1937, was imprisoned by the Japanese invaders in the Overseas Chinese Reception Center on Zhongshan North Road when Nanjing fell. At noon on December 12th of that year, he and more than 2,000 young people who were imprisoned together were divided into four teams by a small group of Japanese soldiers and escorted to the riverside of Xiaguan, where they were mowed down with heavy machine guns. He was fortunate not to be killed at the time and escaped from the corpses afterward. Citizen Li Shigui was a soldier during the war against Japan and was captured by the Japanese invaders during combat. On the day the Japanese invaders occupied Nanjing, he and the remaining captured Chinese soldiers were taken to the Judicial Administration Building on Zhongshan North Road. The Japanese invaders ordered them to climb to the smooth, round roof of the building, and most of them fell to their deaths. The Japanese invaders took pleasure in this. Those who did not die were dragged to Yanziji and collectively massacred by the Japanese invaders with machine guns. He was fortunate not to have fallen to his death or been shot, but he was seriously injured and crawled out of the pile of corpses at night. They all unanimously stated: The Chinese people will never forget this huge blood debt owed by the Japanese invaders. The Chinese people will resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialists' support of Japanese fascist warlords to the end. They painfully demanded that the Japanese war criminals who invaded China, released by the Kuomintang traitorous and reactionary government and the U.S. imperialists, be escorted back to China and severely punished by the Chinese People's Government.

Zhang Shangyi, a technician at a certain machinery repair factory, said painfully at a symposium on the peace treaty with Japan held at the factory: When the Japanese invaded Nanjing, about 2,000 citizens took refuge in the 60th Ordnance Factory. The Japanese invaders drove them out to the open space in the factory and lined them up in rows, mowing them all down with machine guns. After the Japanese invaders committed the crime, they stripped the clothes from the dead, tore them into rags, and distributed them to the factory workers to wipe the machines. He excitedly shouted: "Can we forget this blood debt owed by the Japanese invaders?" A worker named Xu Chao-yi, who lived near Yuhuatai, accused the Japanese invaders of the massacre to the reporter, saying: "At that time, I personally saw many young people being forced by Japanese soldiers' bayonets to dig pits, and then forced to bury each other alive. Every day at 5 p.m., there were no pedestrians on the street, only the terrifying screams of the Japanese devils driving the people to the execution ground." The employees of Nanjing Municipal Public Wireless Factory, Wired Factory, Central Department Store, Yongli Alkali Factory, and other factories also held symposiums on the eve of "July 7th." In their accusations against the Japanese invaders' bloody terror against the people of Nanjing, they firmly stated: We will never allow the Japanese aggressive forces to invade China again and wreak havoc in the Far East! They unanimously opposed the U.S. imperialists' sinful acts of supporting Japanese militarism and demanded that the People's Democratic United Government, which is about to be established, send representatives to participate in the foreign ministers' conference to discuss the Japanese issue and swiftly conclude a peace treaty with Japan to consolidate the foundation of peace in the Far East and world peace.

　　南京各界控诉日寇罪行
    抗议美帝扶植日本侵略势力复活
  　要求速订对日和约严惩侵华战犯
    【新华社南京九日电】南京各界人民于纪念“七七”十二周年时，纷纷控诉日寇在侵占南京期间疯狂屠杀南京市民的血腥暴行，抗议美帝国主义扶植日本侵略势力复活的政策，要求迅速缔结对日和约，严惩日本侵华战犯。记者六日访问了几位亲历日寇在南京屠杀恐怖的市民。他们都曾于一九四七年去日本东京出席过国际法庭作证，但因美帝国主义和国民党卖国反动政府对日本战犯的袒护，毫无结果而在失望和愤恨中回国。陈福宝是南京中华路同昌五金号的店员，他在东京国际法庭上作证两件事：第一件是当一九三七年十二月十二日日寇侵入南京时，在新开路七号目睹两位妇女同胞被一群日寇强奸致死。第二件是日寇在侵占南京后，强入国际委员会设立的难民区，将难民区收容的青年三百余人拖出枪杀，妇女则多被奸污。他说：这些罪行是日寇战犯中岛吾做的，可是中岛吾在抗日胜利后，就被国民党反动政府放回日本去了。一九三七年在南京当警察的王崇德，在南京沦陷时，被日寇关在中山北路的华侨招待所。是年十二月十二日中午，他和被关在一起的二千多青年，被一小队日寇分成四队，押往下关江边，用重机枪扫死。他当时幸未被打死，事后从死尸中逃出。市民李士贵在抗战时是个兵士，在作战中被日寇俘虏。日寇侵陷南京那天，他和其余被俘的中国士兵被押到中山北路司法行政大楼上。日寇命令他们去爬上那光滑的圆形的楼顶，大多数人都堕地摔死。日寇以此取乐。没有死的，又被拖到燕子矶，被日寇用机枪集体屠杀。他幸而未摔死也未被射死，但受了重伤，夜间从死尸堆中爬了出来。他们都一致表示：日寇欠下的这笔大血债，中国人民是永远不会忘记的。对于美帝国主义扶植日本法西斯军阀，中国人民将坚决地反对到底。他们沉痛地要求把被国民党卖国反动政府和美帝国主义释放的日寇侵华战犯押回中国，由中国人民政府严厉惩办。
    某修械厂的技师张尚义在该厂关于对日和约的座谈会上沉痛地说：日本侵占南京时，约有二千市民躲入六十兵工厂。日寇把他们驱逐到厂内空场上排成队，用机枪全部扫死。日寇行凶后，又从死者身上剥下衣裳，撕成破布，发给厂里工人擦机器。他激昂地高呼：“我们难道能忘记日寇所欠的这笔血债吗？”居住在雨花台畔的一个名叫徐超义的工人向记者控诉日寇的大屠杀时说：“那时我亲眼看到许多年青人，在日本兵的刺刀逼迫下挖好土坑，然后又被迫互相活埋。每到下午五时，街上就不见一个行人，只听到日本鬼子赶着老百姓上刑场的恐怖的叫喊声。”南京市公营无线电厂、有线电厂、中央商场、永利铔厂等厂职工，在“七七”前夕也都召开了座谈会。在对日寇对南京人民的血腥恐怖的控诉中，他们坚决地表示：决不允许日寇侵略势力重来侵略中国，为祸远东！他们一致反对美帝扶助日本军国主义的罪恶行为，并要求即将成立的人民民主联合政府派遣代表参加讨论日本问题外长会议，迅速缔结对日和约，以巩固远东和平和世界和平的基础。
