　　Establishing a Regular Learning System
  　The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CCP Issues a Decision on Strengthening Cadre Education
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 30th. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CCP, in order to improve the theoretical, policy, cultural, and professional levels of cadres throughout the city and to improve urban work, has issued a decision on strengthening cadre education. The decision points out that since the liberation of Tianjin half a year ago, the Party has achieved great success in all aspects of work. However, due to the low theoretical and political level of cadres and the lack of deep understanding of the Central Committee of the CCP's urban guidelines and policies, there are still more or less remnants of agricultural socialist thought and the impatience of the petty bourgeoisie. This has led to some mistakes in dealing with labor-capital relations and other issues. At the same time, the state of being unorganized and undisciplined is still serious; individual cadres have even indulged in the extravagant urban life, slackened their work, and pursued personal enjoyment. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the decision stipulates that cadre education work must be strengthened in a planned way in the future, a regular learning system must be established, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought must be studied, and theoretical, policy, cultural, and professional levels must be improved. In order to strengthen the leadership of learning, the decision establishes a General Learning Committee within the Municipal Committee, and the sub-Party committees establish sub-Learning Committees. The general branches and branches directly lead the learning and unify cadre education with organizational life. The General Learning Committee and the sub-Learning Committees should formulate specific methods according to the learning process, select teaching materials, and gradually hold tests, make summaries, and list learning achievements as one of the cadre appraisal items.

　　建立经常学习制度
  　中共天津市委会发出
  　加强干部教育决定
    【新华社天津三十日电】中共天津市委为提高全市干部理论、政策、文化和业务水平，做好城市工作，特发出加强干部教育的决定。决定指出：天津解放半年来，党在各方面的工作已获得很大成绩。但由于干部理论和政治水平不高，对中共中央的城市方针与政策体会不深，还带着或多或少的农业社会主义的思想残余以及小资产阶级的急性病，以致在处理劳资关系等问题上，曾发生某些错误。同时，无组织无纪律状态也还严重存在；个别干部甚至沈溺于城市浮华生活，松懈了工作，追逐个人享受。为克服这些缺点，该决定规定今后必须有计划地加强干部教育工作，建立经常的学习制度，学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，提高理论、政策、文化和业务水平。为加强学习领导，决定市委内成立总学委会，各分党委成立学委分会，总支和支部直接领导学习，将干部教育与组织生活统一起来。总学委和分学委应按照学习过程拟定具体办法，选择教材，并逐步举行测验，作出总结，将学习成绩列为干部鉴定项目之一。
