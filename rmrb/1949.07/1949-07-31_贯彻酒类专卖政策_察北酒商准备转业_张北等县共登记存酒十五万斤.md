　　Implementing the Liquor Monopoly Policy
  　Chabei Liquor Merchants Prepare to Change Professions
    Zhangbei and Other Counties Register a Total of 150,000 Jin of Stored Liquor
    [Chabei News] Since the strengthening of the management of private liquor in Chabei, the declared and registered stored liquor in various counties, according to incomplete statistics as of the beginning of July: Zhangbei, Shangdu, Duolun, Baoyuan, Kangbao, Shangyi, Huade, Chongli and other counties totaled more than 150,000 jin (including 30,000 jin of state-owned stored liquor). It is estimated that there is still a considerable amount of undeclared and unregistered hidden private liquor. In order to save resources for disaster preparedness and help liquor merchants change professions in a timely manner, the Special Commissioner's Office, in addition to issuing announcements on the registration of stored liquor and strengthening anti-smuggling work, reiterated the policy and significance of the state monopoly on liquor sales, instructing all counties to pay attention, quickly follow the decision of North China to establish monopoly institutions, and organize liquor merchants to sell their liquor and change professions. At the same time, in conjunction with local tax bureaus, public security bureaus, and other departments, strictly investigate and ban private brewing. The Special District Tax Bureau and the Monopoly Office have dispatched more than ten cadres to various counties to establish monopoly institutions in order to implement the North China liquor monopoly policy.
    [Another News] Since the establishment of the Liquor Monopoly Office in Zhangbei City on June 22nd, under the direct leadership of the Chabei Special Commissioner's Office, the method of taking liquor in turn from the households storing liquor has been adopted, and more than 2,400 jin of stored liquor have been helped to be sold for liquor merchants. A total of more than 14,000 jin of oat flour has been collected from liquor tax and monopoly profits. After understanding the monopoly policy, liquor merchants have successively requested "Quickly help us sell the liquor, so we can change professions and engage in production." Now liquor merchants have gradually reduced the burden of accumulated funds and are turning to careers that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

　　贯彻酒类专卖政策
  　察北酒商准备转业
    张北等县共登记存酒十五万斤
    【察北讯】察北私酒自加强管理以来，各县申报登记之存酒，据七月初不完全统计：张北、商都、多伦、宝源、康保、尚义、化德、崇礼等县共计十五万斤以上（内公营存酒三万斤）。据估计未申报登记之暗藏私酒，尚有相当数量。专署为节约备荒，帮助酒商及时转业，除布告存酒登记、加强缉私工作外，再次说明酒类专营专卖之政策及意义，指示各县引起注意，迅速遵照华北决定建立专卖机构，组织酒商销酒转业。同时结合当地税务局、公安局等部门，严格查禁私酿。由专区税务局及专卖处抽出干部十余人，分赴各县树立专卖机构，以贯彻华北酒类专卖政策。
    【又讯】张北城自六月二十二日建立酒业专卖处，在察北专署直接领导下，采取向存酒户轮流起酒办法，已帮酒商销出存酒二千四百多斤。共收入酒税及专卖利润莜面一万四千斤以上。酒商了解专卖政策后，纷纷要求“快快帮咱卖了酒，好转业生产。”现酒商已逐渐减去积压资金的负担，转谋有利国计民生的事业。
