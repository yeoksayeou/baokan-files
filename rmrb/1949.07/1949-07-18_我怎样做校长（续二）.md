    How I Work as a Principal (Continued 2)
    By Guo Luowadeyi
  (III) On the Work of Teachers
    Everyone knows that the strength of a teacher collective lies in its organization. But who should do this work? The principal? The Party organization? Or the trade union organization? Obviously, everyone should participate, using the method of a united front. The prerequisite for success is a common effort.
    What exactly is the task of someone like me who is a principal?
    I think my task is first to correctly deploy strengths; to constantly seek to improve teachers' ideological and political levels, as well as their professional abilities; to create conditions for creative research and efforts to improve the quality of teaching work; and finally, to try to help teachers' public activities as much as possible.
    At first glance, all this seems simple, ordinary, and easy to accomplish. But in fact, these tasks are complex and require great effort and unremitting attention to complete.
    I usually deploy manpower for the future at the end of the academic year, based on the teachers' talents and abilities. The year's summary clearly shows each teacher's talents; this is the best time to make necessary re-deployments. But it should not be forgotten that this work often causes dissatisfaction among those being transferred and sometimes hurts teachers' self-esteem. Therefore, it is very important to negotiate with the teacher beforehand and obtain his consent. Only when it is unavoidable should orders be given, without hesitation in taking this approach for the benefit of the work.
    The main direction of effort, of course, is to conduct ideological and political education for teachers and improve their professional quality. This is the decisive factor. If a teacher constantly focuses on self-cultivation, if he consistently pays attention to major political events, and knows the theories and practices of advanced Soviet science, then it is conceivable that he will correctly solve and practice any problem in his actual activities in any school work department.
    We set aside four days each month for teachers to study on their own. Before each study of "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course," before class in the study group on the origins of Marxism-Leninism, or finally before the start of science popularization lectures, we conduct a short political report of two or three minutes. This so-called political report of a few minutes has become a tradition. Teachers eagerly await the political report, and the speaker should prepare well to meet the requirements of our collective. The speakers are our teachers.
    We organize two science popularization reports for teachers each month, explaining the achievements of Soviet science and technology. We strive to cover all aspects of knowledge. Even so, about half of the reports are specifically on pedagogy, teaching methods, and psychology.
    Discussions, study groups, and reading teachers' outlines and articles in the school's collection of pedagogical literature – all this presents a complete concept of teachers' commitment to self-cultivation and to improving their ideological and political levels. This makes it possible to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each teacher and makes it possible to help them when necessary.
    For those teachers who have difficulty attending ordinary study classes and preparing for classes due to family circumstances, we organize special study classes, striving to create the best study environment for them.
    The method of giving teachers individual tasks to prepare reports is of great benefit. Usually, two or three months are set aside to prepare each such report. At the same time, attention should also be paid to ensuring that the work of preparing reports becomes a stimulus for acquiring and consolidating scientific knowledge in all aspects.
    The results of this work are submitted to me in picture form and are often used in collections of pedagogical literature.
    Teachers have great creative potential, but to realize this potential, favorable conditions are needed. Creating these conditions is the principal's task. For example, if a teacher is studying the issue of object-based teaching or the issue of greening the campus, or if he sets his task as studying the practice of promoting "Student Regulations," he needs help in selecting necessary reading materials, ensuring that he can obtain materials, and giving him the opportunity to visit schools where these issues have been well studied and well practiced.
    The entire school should be intimately involved in the work of each teacher, paying attention to it and promoting it on the right path with comradely criticism.
    None of our teachers has not studied a creative educational practice problem. Without this, the life and work of each teacher and the entire school cannot have full value.
    A rigid and clear school schedule is, of course, a condition for the teacher collective to carry out productive work.
    The principal should not tolerate manifestations of disorganization in teachers' work.
    All this ultimately creates a working environment for the entire school and individual teachers.
    Everyone knows that teachers who do not engage in public work cannot consider their lives and work to have full value. The characteristics of teachers' noble activities lie here. The principal, the local trade union committee, and the Party organization should be concerned about this issue. At the beginning of the academic year, cultural and recreational teachers must be attached to a production, attached to a collective farm or state-owned farm.
    Thus, organizing and uniting the teacher collective means promoting the prosperity of all its professional, social, and political qualities. This is the principal's primary duty.
    (IV) On the Work of Students
    The most difficult task for the principal is organizing students.
    The teacher collective and the student collective grow and consolidate simultaneously, with a direct interrelationship. But the student collective still needs special attention and special work.
    The main issues here are: the work plan of student organizations; general and grade-level student meetings; holding open educational conferences jointly with seventh and tenth grade students and their parents; work on the Communist Youth League, Young Pioneers, and student committees; leading student "publications"; and organizing extracurricular and off-campus work.
    Student organizations' plans are usually drawn up monthly, with the participation of teachers attached to the various departments of the Communist Youth League, Young Pioneers, and student committees.
    I pay special attention to student meetings, carefully preparing myself for participating in such meetings and also requiring others to do so, because I believe that only well-prepared general or grade-level student meetings can help organize the student collective.
    I usually personally preside over the general meetings of an entire batch of students entering the school at the same time. These meetings last for two or three minutes, without electing a presidium. The issues discussed at these meetings are: "Student Regulations," the daily schedule, monthly performance summaries, and public welfare work. We also talk about problems that violate the code of conduct and standards, and finally, we also talk about models of labor and conduct that should be regarded as benchmarks.
    The basic requirement I set for myself when attending student meetings is that the ideas should be simple and moving.
    I try to grasp the attention of the meeting with the intonation of my voice, sometimes also with humor and excerpts from Soviet and Russian classical literature. I need to make students understand what my requirements are and what they should do to fulfill my requirements.
    Two or three students' speeches bring the meeting to a close. I then propose that all students be required to complete our decision, entrusting a certain department of the student committee to review its implementation through its duty officers, entrusting a certain grade leader to help a certain student in a certain aspect, and so on.
    Grade-level student meetings are presided over by the homeroom teacher. Here, a presidium is elected, and minutes are taken. The decisions of the grade-level meetings are communicated to the student committee when the issues are directly related to the student committee.
    Open educational conferences are held three times a year: September, December, and March. There are one or two items on the agenda, and most of it is the homeroom teacher's report on academic performance. In March, an item on preparing for exams is added to the agenda. This type of open educational conference attended by seventh and tenth grade students and their parents, as mentioned above, is a good education for students. Here, they receive a frank evaluation of their labor and conduct from teachers and relatives.
    It is conceivable that homeroom teachers and all teachers should be sufficiently tactical and prudent when speaking at this educational conference. Parents are also given advance notice of this.
    The Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations are the basic core for uniting and organizing students. The activities of these organizations largely determine the success of the school's teaching work. This should not be forgotten.
    Working hard for these entire organizations must not be limited to working as much as for their constituent parts (Communist Youth League groups, Young Pioneer groups, etc.). Here, the conduct, achievements, and social activism of Communist Youth League members and Young Pioneers must be established and determined to the greatest extent. Communist Youth League group organizers and Young Pioneer group leaders are chosen by me with extra care, because they should be impeccable in all aspects.
    It is they who provide timely help to a comrade organizer, notifying him, raising issues about him at the Communist Youth League committee or Young Pioneer detachment committee, and finally, when necessary, talking about him at the Communist Youth League conference or the school-wide conference.
    Practice has shown that discussing the academic performance and conduct issues of various Young Pioneers and Communist Youth League members at general meetings has a great impact on the student collective. Of course, one should not be fascinated by this point, but in individual cases, this can play a significant role.
    Before adopting all important school measures, the Communist Youth League committee meetings and the Young Pioneers committees are discussed in advance. If the issue is very important and requires the efforts of the student collective to implement (greening the campus, preparing exhibitions, going to the fields of collective farms, etc.), then the issue is submitted to the school-wide student conference for discussion.

    我怎样做校长（续二）
    郭洛瓦德伊作
  （三）对教师的工作
    大家都知道，教员集体的力量在于组织性。但谁应该做这方面的工作呢？校长？党组织？还是职工会组织呢？显而易见，大家都来，用统一战线的方法。成功的前提在于努力的共同性。
    我当校长者的任务究竟是什么呢？
    我想，我的任务首先在于：正确地部署力量；不断地求教师的思想水平、政治水平及业务能力的提高；创立在改进教学工作质量上可进行创造性的研究与努力的条件；最后，尽量设法帮助教师的公共活动。
    初看起来，这一切好象都很简单，平常而容易完成。但事实上，这些任务复杂得要作很大的努力和不懈的注意才能完成。
    我通常在学年终了时按教师的才能与本领为将来而布署人力。一年的总结，明显地表现了各教师的才能；这时候最好进行必要的重新布署。但不应该忘记，这一工作常常引起被调动者的不满，有时候并触伤教师的自尊心。因此，事先和教师谈判，获得他的同意，乃是非常重要的。只有在不得已时才以命令行事，而不犹豫不决不敢采取这一为了工作利益的办法。
    主要努力的方向，当然是对教师进行思想教育和政治教育，并提高其业务质量。这是决定性的因素。假如一个教师经常注重自我修养，假如他一贯注视政治上的重大事件，知道先进苏维埃科学的理论与实践，则可想而知，他会在任何学校工作部门的自己实际活动上正确地解决并实践任何问题的。
    我们每月抽出四天的时间供教师自修。在每一次研究“联共（布）历史简要读本”的学习开始以前，在自修马列主义起源的研究班上课以前，或最后是在科学普及讲演开始以前，我们进行短短二三十分钟的政治报告。这种通称的政治报告几分钟，已成为传统了。教师们急迫地等待着政治报告，报告人应该很好地准备，以求满足我们集体的要求。做报告人的，便是我们的教师。
    我们每月为教师组织两次科学普及报告，说明苏维埃科学与技术的成绩。我们力求包罗各方面的知识。虽然如此，但约有一半报告是专论教育学、教授法、心理学的。
    交谈会、研究班，阅览学校的各教授法文集中教师的纲要与文章——这一切便提出了关于教师致力于自我修养与致力于提高自己的思想水平、政治水平的完全概念。这使各教师的长处与弱点有可能显露出来，并使必要时帮助他们也可能了。
    为那些因家庭关系而难以上普通的学习课和为上课而准备的教师，我们则组织专门的学习课，力求为他们创立最好的学习环境。
    给教师以准备报告的个人任务这种方法，是有很大的益处的。通常要抽出两三个月的时间准备每一个这样的报告。同时还要注意，准备报告这一工作应该成为获取与巩固各方面的科学知识的刺激。
    这一工作的结果以画面形式交与我，并常常用于教授法文集中。
    教师的创造可能性是很大的，但要实现这些可能性，则需要有利的条件。创立这些条件，便是校长的任务。例如假使有一个教师在研究实物讲授问题或绿化校园问题，或是他将自己的任务定为研究“学生守则”发扬的实践，他便需要帮助他选择必要的读物，保证他可以获得材料，给予他以机会去访问这些问题已被很好地研究过并很好地实践着的学校。
    全校对于每一个教师的工作应该是血肉相关的，应该注视着它，并以同志态度的批评推动它走在正确的道路上。
    我们这里没有一个教师没有研究过一个创造性的教育实践问题。不这样，各教师及全学校的生活和工作便不可能有充分的价值。
    硬性而明确的学校作息制度，是教员集体进行生产性工作的当然条件。
    校长对于教师工作无组织性的表现，应该是不能容忍的。
    这一切终于造成了学校全体及教师个人的工作环境。
    大家都知道，没有公共工作的教师，不能认为自己的生活和劳动有充分的价值。教师的高尚活动的特性便在这里。校长、职工会地方委员会、党组织，应该关心这一问题。在学年开始的时候，必须使文化娱乐教师附属于一种生产，附属于集体农场或国营农场。
    这样，组织并团结教员集体，便意味着促进其一切业务的、社会的与政治的品质的繁荣。这里是校长的首要职务。
    （四）对学生的工作
    校长最困难的任务，乃是组织学生。
    教员集体与学生集体是同时成长巩固的，有直接的相互依赖关系。但学生集体仍是需要有特殊的注意和特殊的工作的。
    这里的主要问题是这样的：学生组织的工作计划；全体的和各级的学生会议；与第七级和第十级的学生及家长共同举行公开的教育会议；对共青团、儿童团及学生委员会的工作；领导学生的“出版物”；组织级外的和校外的工作。
    学生组织的计划通常是按月编制的，编制时有附属于共青团、儿童团及学生委员会各部门的教师参加。
    我对于学生会议格外注意，自己慎密地为参加这种会议而做准备工作，并也要求别人如此，因为我认为只有准备得很好的全体的或各级的学生会议，才能帮助组织学生集体。
    我通常亲自主持同时入校的一整批学生的全体会议。这种会议历时二三十分钟，不选主席团，这种会议讨论的问题是：“学生守则”，每日作息制度，每月成绩总结，公益工作。我们也谈到破坏品行守则和标准的问题，最后，还谈到应该作为看齐标准的、劳动上与品行上的典型。
    我在出席学生会议时为自己定下的基本要求，便是思想要简单动人。
    我力图用声调的抑扬，有时候还用默幽及苏维埃的和俄罗斯的古典文学摘句来掌握会上的注意力。我需要使学生明了我的要求是什么，及为了完成我的要求应该做什么。
    两三个学生的发言，便使会议结束了。我便建议要求全体学生完成我们的决定，委托学生委员会的某某部门通过其值班者审查执行，委托某某级长在某某方面帮助某某学生等等。
    各级的学生会议由级任导师主持。这里是选主席团的，并作会议记录。各级会议的决定，在问题与学生委员会有直接关系时，转达给学生委员会。
    公开的教育会议每年举行三次：九月，十二月，三月。议程上有一两个问题，大部份则是级任导师关于成绩情况的报告。三月份时，议程上补充一项关于准备考试的问题。这种如上所述有第七级及第十级学生及其家长出席的公开的教育会议，对于学生是一种很好的教育。他们在这里获得教师及亲戚对于自己的劳动与品行的坦率评价。
    可想而知，级任导师及一切教师在这种教育会议上发言时应该足够有策略和审慎。家长关于这一点也获有预告。
    共青团和儿童团的组织，是团结与组织学生的基本核心。这些组织的活动，在很大的程度上决定着学校教学工作的成绩。这是不应该忘记的。
    对于整个这些组织顽强地做工作，必须不仅限于象对于其组成环节（各级共青团小组、儿童团小组等等）所做工作一样多。这里要最多地制定和确定着共青团员与儿童团员的品行、成绩及社会积极性。共青团小组组织者及儿童团小组长，是由我格外慎密地选择的，因为他们在各方面应该是无可非议的。
    正是他们对于一个同志组织着及时的帮助，预告他，在共青团委员会或儿童团支队委员会上提出关于他的问题，并最后于必要时，在共青团会议上或全校会议上谈到他。
    实践表明了：在全体大会上讨论各儿童团员与共青团员的成绩与品行问题，对学生集体有极大的影响。当然不应该被这一点迷住了，但在个别情况下，这是可能起很大作用的。
    采行一切重要的学校措施以前，共青团委员会会议与儿童团委员会都是事先要进行讨论的。假如问题非常重要，实行起来必需学生集体的努力（绿化校园，准备展览会，赴集体农场的田地里等等），则将问题提交全校生会议讨论。（未完）
