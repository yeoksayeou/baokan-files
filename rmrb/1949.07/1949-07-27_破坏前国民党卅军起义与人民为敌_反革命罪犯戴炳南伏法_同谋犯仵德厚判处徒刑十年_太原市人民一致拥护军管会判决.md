Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th. Counter-Revolutionary Criminal Dai Bingnan Executed; Accomplice Wu Dehou Sentenced to Ten Years Imprisonment; Taiyuan City People Unanimously Support the Military Control Commission's Verdict.

　　The People's Liberation Army Taiyuan Military Control Commission ordered on the 8th of this month the execution of counter-revolutionary criminal Dai Bingnan, former commander of the 27th Division of the Kuomintang 30th Army, for sabotaging the uprising of the Kuomintang 30th Army on the Taiyuan front in November of last year. In October of last year, after the People's Liberation Army swept away Yan Xishan's bandit troops in central Shanxi, it began to encircle Taiyuan. General Huang Qiaosong, commander of the Kuomintang 30th Army on the Taiyuan front, under the influence of the People's Liberation Army's successive victories and the persuasion of General Xu Xiangqian, recognized the strength of the people's forces and, in response to the demands of the broad masses of officers and soldiers, decided to stage an uprising at the front to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiyuan. Unfortunately, he was betrayed by his subordinate, Dai Bingnan. Dai used double-dealing tactics, expressing agreement with the uprising. After obtaining General Huang Qiaosong's uprising plan, on November 3rd, he conspired with his confidant Wu Dehou, the deputy commander of the 27th Division, to inform Yan Xishan. Yan immediately used a conspiracy to detain General Huang Qiaosong and arrest Jin Tian, the chief of staff of the 8th Column, who was sent by the People's Liberation Army to General Huang Qiaosong's headquarters as a liaison officer. Huang and Jin were both escorted to Nanjing, where they were brutally murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and died heroically. The Kuomintang 30th Army's uprising plan was thus completely sabotaged. Dai Bingnan used the blood of the people to exchange for the position of acting commander of the Kuomintang 30th Army, and accomplice Wu Dehou was also promoted to acting commander of the 27th Division.
    On April 20th of this year, the People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive against Taiyuan. Two days before the liberation of Taiyuan, Dai Bingnan forced his subordinates to continue to act as cannon fodder for the reactionaries, while he, under the pretext of going to the eastern city to supervise the battle, hid in a false wall cabinet in a civilian house, falsely reporting his death to the outside world, attempting to wait for an opportunity to escape. However, with the assistance of the broad masses of the people, the People's Liberation Army finally arrested Dai Bingnan on May 2nd. Wu Dehou was captured during the liberation of Taiyuan.
    On the afternoon of July 8th, the People's Liberation Army Taiyuan Military Control Commission convened a special court to try Dai Bingnan and Wu Dehou, two heinous counter-revolutionary criminals. The special court received as many as 124 indictments from the people. Madam Wang Yifang, the wife of General Huang Qiaosong, also wrote a letter from Wuhu to the Taiyuan Military Control Commission, requesting that Dai Bingnan be severely punished. After the court session began, the citizens participating in the trial denounced the towering crimes of Dai and Wu. After the chief prosecutor read the indictment, prosecutor Li Chengrui also read four pieces of evidence of Dai's sabotage of the Kuomintang 30th Army uprising, including the draft telegram from Yan Xishan to Chiang Kai-shek, which detailed the process of Dai's informing and sabotaging the uprising. In the face of conclusive evidence, Dai and Wu fully confessed to their crimes. After the trial, presiding judge Pei Lisheng read out the verdict: counter-revolutionary criminal Dai Bingnan was sentenced to death and executed on the same day; accomplice Wu Dehou was sentenced to ten years imprisonment and deprived of political rights for ten years. This solemn verdict was unanimously supported by the people's representatives and the people of the city present as jurors.
    On July 9th, the Shanxi Daily published a short commentary entitled "The Chief Culprit Must Be Punished," pointing out that the Taiyuan Military Control Commission's execution of Dai Bingnan was the just demand of the broad masses of the people and was fully in line with the policy principle of the People's Liberation Army that the chief culprit must be punished, the coerced will not be questioned, and the meritorious will be rewarded. The leniency policy of our People's Government is well known, but the leniency policy is not without principles. For those conspirators who continue to do evil, we must resolutely suppress them. Only in this way can we uphold justice, and only in this way can we safeguard the rule of law.

　　Trial Process
    [Taiyuan Special Dispatch] The Taiyuan Military Control Commission Special Tribunal tried the deadly enemy of the people of Taiyuan, the major counter-revolutionary criminal Chiang Kai-shek's 30th Army Acting Commander Dai Bingnan and his accomplice, the 30th Army 27th Division Acting Commander Wu Dehou. The trial began at 12:30 PM, held at the former pseudo-Shanxi High Court. Eight representatives from all walks of life were invited to participate as jurors, and there were 107 seats for the public. After the presiding judge and chief judge Pei Lisheng announced the opening of the court and conducted a simple interrogation, the chief prosecutor and the prosecutor made accusations and read out evidence. The prosecutor also read the original letter from Wang Yifang, the wife of General Huang Qiaosong, sent from Wuhu, requesting the punishment of counter-revolutionary criminal Dai Bingnan. When the prosecutor read: "Dai Bingnan is a sinner of the country and an enemy of the people, so I request the Taiyuan Military Control Commission to severely punish him!" the entire court was silent. After the evidence was read, the presiding judge officially began the interrogation: Did you know about Huang Qiaosong's uprising plan at the time? Dai answered: I knew. Asked: Did you tell Yan Xishan about General Huang Qiaosong's uprising plan? Answer: Yes. Asked: Did you know about the losses suffered by the people of Taiyuan because you sabotaged the uprising? Answer: I know, houses were destroyed, people died, and the war was prolonged. Asked: What crime should you be charged with for sabotaging Huang Qiaosong's uprising? Answer: Capital crime. Asked: Are you worthy of the 300,000 people of Taiyuan? Answer: I am not. After the interrogation of Dai Bingnan was completed, the defendant pressed his handprint on his confession, had his photo taken, and was immediately dismissed from the court to await the verdict. When interrogating accomplice Wu Dehou, Wu fully admitted the fact that he conspired with counter-revolutionary criminal Dai Bingnan to sabotage the uprising; and after the liberation of Taiyuan, he never reported Dai's hiding place. The presiding judge announced the adjournment of the court at 2:20 PM, and the court was reconvened for the second time at 3:15 PM. Presiding judge and chief judge Pei Lisheng read the verdict: Counter-revolutionary criminal Dai Bingnan was sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life, and accomplice Wu Dehou was sentenced to ten years imprisonment and deprived of political rights for ten years. After reading the verdict, Wu Dehou was first ordered to be dismissed from the court, and then he ordered: Tie him to the execution ground! Several guards immediately rushed forward and tied up counter-revolutionary criminal Dai Bingnan. A large truck loaded with guards and cavalry escorted him to the execution ground outside Xin Nanmen to be executed by firing squad.
    The representatives from all walks of life who attended the special court trial of Dai and Wu, upon the court's announcement of the verdict against the two criminals, issued a written statement supporting the verdict. The statement is as follows: We, the representatives of all walks of life, participated in the Taiyuan Military Control Commission's special court trial of counter-revolutionary elements Dai Bingnan and Wu Dehou, and fully support the special court's verdict against the two counter-revolutionary elements Dai and Wu. Because Dai Bingnan and Wu Dehou betrayed the uprising of General Huang Qiaosong of the former Kuomintang 30th Army, causing the 300,000 masses of our Taiyuan to suffer several more months of oppression from Yan Xishan, and causing many masses to fall into hunger and death, if the People's Liberation Army had not liberated Taiyuan, the people of Taiyuan would have been completely squeezed and destroyed by Yan Xishan. Today, in the courtroom, the crimes of Dai and Wu were as solid as iron, and they have all admitted to them. Therefore, we support the special court's verdict of imposing the death penalty on Dai Bingnan and sentencing Wu Dehou to ten years imprisonment.

　　破坏前国民党卅军起义与人民为敌
    反革命罪犯戴炳南伏法
  　同谋犯仵德厚判处徒刑十年
    太原市人民一致拥护军管会判决
    【新华社北平二十六日电】人民解放军太原市军事管制委员会于本月八日下令枪毙在去年十一月间破坏太原前线国民党军第三十军起义的反革命罪犯——前国民党第三十军二十七师师长戴匪炳南。去年十月间，人民解放军扫荡了山西中部的阎匪军之后，开始包围太原。太原前线国民党第三十军军长黄樵松将军，在解放军节节胜利的影响和徐向前将军的劝告下，认识到人民力量的强大，顺应广大官兵的要求，决定阵前起义，配合解放军解放太原。但不幸为他的部下戴匪炳南所出卖。戴匪使用两面派手段，表示同意起义，在取得了黄樵松将军的起义计划之后，于十一月三日与其亲信二十七师副师长仵匪德厚同谋，向阎匪锡山告密。阎匪立即使用阴谋，把黄樵松将军扣押，同时将人民解放军派往黄樵松将军处担任联络员的第八纵队参谋处长晋天逮捕。黄晋二人同被押往南京，横遭蒋匪杀害，壮烈殉难。国民党第三十军的起义计划，就这样全部被破坏。而戴匪炳南则以人民的鲜血，换得了国民党三十军代理军长的职务，同谋犯仵匪德厚也被擢升为二十七师代理师长。
    今年四月二十日，人民解放军对太原发动总攻。戴匪炳南在太原解放前两天，强迫部下继续替反动派充当炮灰，而自己以去东城督战为名，潜匿在一家民房的夹墙大柜里面，对外假报阵亡，企图待机逃跑。但是人民解放军终于在广大人民协助下，于五月二日把戴匪炳南逮捕。仵匪德厚则在太原解放时被俘掳。
    七月八日下午，人民解放军太原市军管会召开特别法庭，审讯戴炳南、仵德厚这两个穷凶极恶的反革命罪犯。特别法庭曾经接到人民控诉书一百二十四件之多。黄樵松将军夫人王怡芳女士，也从芜湖写信给太原市军管会，要求严厉惩办戴匪炳南。开庭后，参加审判的市民，都痛斥戴、仵两匪的滔天罪行。在首席检察官宣读公诉书后，检察官李成瑞，又宣读了戴匪破坏国民党三十军起义的四个证件，其中包括阎匪锡山打给蒋介石的电报底稿，这个电报详细地叙述了戴匪告密破坏起义的经过。在确凿的证据面前，戴、仵两匪全部供认犯罪事实不讳。经过审判以后，庭长裴丽生宣读判决书：反革命罪犯戴炳南判处死刑，当天执行枪决；同谋犯仵德厚判处徒刑十年，褫夺公权十年。这一个严正的裁判，获得了出席陪审的人民代表和全市人民的一致拥护。
    七月九日，山西日报以“首恶者必办”为题发表短评，指出太原军管会枪毙戴匪炳南，是广大人民的正义要求，是完全符合人民解放军首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖的政策原则的。我人民政府的宽大政策，为人所共知，但宽大政策并不是没有原则，对于那些继续作恶的阴谋分子，就一定要坚决镇压，不如此不足以伸张正义，不如此不足以维护法纪。
  　审判经过
    【太原专电】　太原市军事管制委员会特别法庭审判太原市人民的死敌，重大反革命罪犯蒋匪三十军代理军长戴炳南及其帮凶三十军二十七师代理师长仵德厚。审判于上午十二点半开始，假前伪山西高等法院进行，被邀参加陪审的各界人民代表八名，并设有一百零七个旁听席。庭长兼审判长裴丽生宣布开庭及简单审问后，首席检察官与检察官起诉及宣读证件，检察官并宣读了黄樵松将军夫人王怡芳从芜湖寄来的要求惩办反革命罪犯戴炳南的原信。当检察官念到：“戴炳南是国家的罪人，人民的仇敌，所以我请求太原市军事管制委员会严厉惩办他！”整个法庭静寂无声。证件读完，审判长便正式开始审问：黄樵松的起义计划你当时知道吗？戴答：知道。问：黄樵松将军的起义计划是你告诉阎锡山的吗？答：是的。问：你破坏了起义，太原的老百姓所受的损失知道了吗？答：知道，房屋破坏，人民死亡，战争延长。问：你破坏了黄樵松的起义应得何罪？答：死罪。问：你对得起太原三十万人民吗？答：对不起。审问戴炳南完毕，被告人在口供上押手印拍照后，当即退庭，听候判决。在审问同谋犯仵德厚时，仵完全承认了同反革命罪犯戴炳南同谋破坏起义的事实；当太原解放后，他又始终不报告戴的隐藏处。庭长于两点二十分钟宣布休庭，至三点十五分钟第二次开庭，由庭长兼审判长裴丽生宣读判决书：反革命罪犯戴炳南判处死刑，褫夺公权终身，同谋犯仵德厚判处徒刑十年，褫夺公权十年。宣读毕，先令仵德厚退庭，然后喝令：绑赴刑场！几个卫工立即拥上前将反革命罪犯戴炳南捆起，由电辆装满警卫部队的大卡车和骑兵，押往新南门外刑场，执行枪决。
    当时出席特别法庭审判戴、仵两罪犯的各界代表会陪审员，于法庭宣布对戴、仵两匪的判决后，发表书面声明，拥护此一判决。声明如下：我们各界代表会的代表，参加了军事管制委员会特别法庭对反革命分子戴炳南、仵德厚的审判，对特别法庭对戴、仵两反革命分子的判决，完全拥护。因为戴匪炳南、仵匪德厚对出卖原国民党三十军黄樵松将军的起义，使我们太原三十万群众，多受阎匪几个月的压迫，使不少群众陷于饥饿与死亡，若非解放军解放太原，太原人民必为阎匪压榨、摧残死尽。今天法庭上对戴、仵两匪，因其罪恶铁案如山，已全部承认，因此我们拥护特别法庭对戴匪炳南处以极刑，仵德厚判以十年徒刑的判决。
