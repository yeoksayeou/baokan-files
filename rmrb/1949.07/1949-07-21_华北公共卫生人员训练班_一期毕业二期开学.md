　　North China Public Health Personnel Training Class
　　First Term Graduates, Second Term Begins
　　[Tongzhou News] The North China Public Health Personnel Training Class held a grand ceremony in Tongzhou on the 16th to mark the graduation of the first term and the commencement of the second term. Su Jingguan, Minister of the General Health Department of the People's Liberation Army, Xiong Jinqing, Deputy Secretary-General of the Liberated Areas Relief General Association, Kang Keqing, Minister of the Women and Children Welfare Department of the All-China Women's Federation, and more than twenty other guests attended. After a speech by Shen Yuanhui, Director of the Training Class, Minister Su spoke, emphasizing that the mortality rate of the Chinese people, especially infants, is very high, and this cannot be saved by treatment alone. Therefore, the task of active prevention falls on the shoulders of public health personnel. He cited the example of tens of thousands of people in Northeast China dying from pneumonic plague three years ago. Through active prevention in recent years, the number has decreased year by year, with only two deaths this year, which fully proves that prevention is better than treatment. Finally, he encouraged everyone to not be afraid of difficulties and to take on this great work. Minister Kang Keqing said: "The people have improved their lives after liberation, and favorable economic conditions have laid a good foundation for public health work. However, due to thousands of years of feudal rule, there are difficulties for rural areas to accept scientific knowledge, which requires everyone's efforts." She also expressed her respect on behalf of the Women's Federation to the comrades who will be working in the countryside. She encouraged the second term students to study politics and technology hard, and to serve the people wholeheartedly.

　　华北公共卫生人员训练班
  　一期毕业二期开学
    【通州讯】华北公共卫生人员训练班十六日在通州举行第一期毕业、第二期开学典礼大会。人民解放军总卫生部苏井观部长，解放区救济总会熊瑾玎副秘书长，全国妇联妇女儿童福利部康克清部长等来宾二十余人亲往参加。训练班主任沈元晖致词后，接着由苏部长讲话，他着重指出中国人民特别是婴儿的死亡率很大，但这绝非治疗工作所能挽救，因此，积极预防的任务，就放在公共卫生人员的肩上。他举出东北三年前因患鼠疫病死者达数万。近年来经积极预防，逐年减少，今年只死两个，这充分证实了预防胜于治疗。最后他勉励大家不怕困难，担负起这个伟大的工作。康克清部长说：“人民经过翻身，生活改善了，有利的经济条件给公共卫生工作打下良好基础。但由于几千年的封建统治，使农村接受科学知识有着困难，还需大家努力。”她并代表妇联对将下乡工作的同志表示敬意。勉励二期同学努力学习政治、技术，全心全意为人民服务。
