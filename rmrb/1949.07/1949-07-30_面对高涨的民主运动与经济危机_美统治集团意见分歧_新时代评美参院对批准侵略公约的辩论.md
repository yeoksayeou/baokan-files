Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 29th: TASS, Moscow, July 27th: This issue of "New Era" carries an article by Sergeyeva commenting on the US Senate's debate on the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, stating that the debate revealed noteworthy differences of opinion within the US ruling group. Some senators, who were by no means opposed to the policy of aggression, voted against it. One of them was the very influential Republican Senator Taft. These senators also opposed the government's arms program.

It is obvious why some US senators opposed the plan to arm Western Europe. The development of the situation is overturning some imperialist plans. American monopoly capitalists have learned a little lesson from arming Kuomintang China, from the shameful intervention in Greece, and from the failure of the Marshall Plan. Therefore, some senators have to think more about how to arm and when to arm.

    新时代评美参院对批准侵略公约的辩论
    【新华社北平二十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：本期新时代刊载塞尔格叶瓦评论美国政院对北大西洋公约的辩论称：美国参院对批准侵略性的北大西洋公约的辩论，显露了美国统治集团中值得注意的意见分歧。一些决不是反对侵略政策的参议员，投了反对票。其中一个是很有势力的共和党参议员塔夫脱。这些参议员同时也反对政府的武装计划。
    美国某些参议员为什么要反对武装西欧的计划，是显而易见的。形势的发展正在推翻某些帝国主义的计划。美国的垄断资本家在武装国民党中国、在对希腊可耻的干涉和马歇尔计划的失败中，稍微学到了一点教训。因此，某些参议员在如何去武装以及什么时候武装这个问题上，不得不多考虑一下。
