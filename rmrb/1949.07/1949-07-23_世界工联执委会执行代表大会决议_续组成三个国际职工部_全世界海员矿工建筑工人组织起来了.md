Fresinet (France) was elected as the general secretary. The headquarters of the federation will be located in Marseille. After the founding conference, a mass rally was held in Marseille. WFTU General Secretary Saillant said at the meeting: The first truly international seafarers and dockworkers federation in history has been established.
