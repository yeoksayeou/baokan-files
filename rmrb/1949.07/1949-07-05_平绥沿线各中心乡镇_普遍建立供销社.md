　　Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Universally Established in Central Townships Along the Ping-Sui Railway Line

　　[News from Chahar Province] The pilot program for urban and rural supply and marketing cooperatives in Chahar Province has been launched with a focus on areas along the Ping-Sui Railway Line since the end of April. In addition to the cities of Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, the pilot counties include: Zhangbei, Wanquan, Huailai, Yanqing, Zhuolu, Longguan, Chicheng, and Xuanhua. Supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in eighteen central townships (such as Shacheng, Tumu, Kangzhuang, Gonghui, etc.). These eight counties had no cooperative foundation in the past. At the beginning of the pilot program, the first problem encountered was the spreading of rumors and sabotage by special agents and profiteers. However, the pilot program cadres, on the one hand, publicized the policy of supply and marketing cooperatives, combined with exposing rumors; on the other hand, from the very beginning of the organization, they helped the masses solve supply and marketing difficulties and saw practical benefits, quickly dispelling the doubts of the broad masses and gradually establishing a correct understanding of the supply and marketing cooperatives. As of May 25th, 13,695 people had voluntarily joined the cooperatives (excluding Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua).

　　Immediately after their establishment, they provided a relatively large amount of supply and procurement to members and non-members. In May, the supply included: native cloth, foreign cloth, grain, edible salt, and other materials totaling 59,016,232 yuan in Renminbi. A total of grain and other agricultural products were purchased, totaling 55,327,186 yuan in Renminbi. Due to the preferential treatment of state-owned commerce and industry (low-price supply, high-price purchase), through the business activities of supply and marketing cooperatives, essential goods were supplied to the masses at lower than market prices, and agricultural products were purchased at prices higher than the market, thereby reducing the intermediate exploitation of commercial capital.

　　In addition, work was organized in disaster areas to help disaster victims overcome their difficulties and pre-purchase sesame seeds. Longguan, Yanqing, Chongli, Huairou and other counties suffered from enemy disasters and natural disasters such as wind, hail, and drought last year. The masses faced serious difficulties in their lives and production. The supply and marketing cooperatives purchased large quantities of the region's special products - medicinal materials. As of June 15th, 344,222 jin of medicinal materials had been purchased in these four counties, exchanging 158,694 jin of grain and 2,160 jin of edible salt, partially solving the livelihood difficulties of the disaster victims during summer hoeing.

　　In the pilot program, many deviations also occurred. The main one was that a considerable amount of grace viewpoint occurred in the pricing of goods, losing national funds. A few supply and marketing cooperatives used funds inflexibly and stockpiled materials for a long time. For example, the Longguan Supply and Marketing Cooperative stipulated that foreign cloth should be sold to members for 60 yuan per chi, and to non-members for 80 yuan, while the market price at that time was 100 yuan. The Chicheng Supply and Marketing Cooperative stipulated that sesame oil should be sold to members for 120 yuan per jin, while the market price at that time was 180 yuan. The Yanqing Supply and Marketing Cooperative stored more than 100,000 jin of millet for a long time, and the Huailai Supply and Marketing Cooperative stored thousands of bolts of native cloth. This practice of excessively lowering prices and storing materials for a long time damaged the funds of the supply and marketing cooperatives and made them inflexible, affecting business development. In business operations, there was a lack of enterprise spirit, too many business personnel, and excessive expenses.

### 平绥沿线各中心乡镇　普遍建立供销社

　　平绥沿线各中心乡镇
  　普遍建立供销社
    【察省讯】察省城镇供销合作社的试办，自四月底以来在平绥沿线有重点地展开。除张家口、宣化两市外，试办县有：张北、万全、怀来、延庆、涿鹿、龙关、赤城、宣化八个县已在十八个中心乡镇建立了供销社（如沙城、土木、康庄、公会等）。该八个县在过去都没有合作社基础，开始试办时，首先碰到的是特务分子、奸商的造谣破坏，但由于试办干部一面宣传供销社的方针，结合揭破谣言；另外，一开始组织，就帮助群众解决供销困难，见到实惠，很快就解除了广大群众的疑虑，对供销社逐步有了正确的认识。到五月二十五日止，已有一万三千六百九十五人自动入了社（不包括张宣两市）。
    刚一建立，对社员和非社员作了较大量的供给、收购。五月份计供给：土布、洋布、粮食、食盐等物资共折合人民币五千九百零一万六千二百三十二元，共收购粮食及其他农产品共折合人民币五千五百三十二万七千一百八十六元。由于国营商业和工业的优待（低价供给，高价收买），经过供销社的业务活动，低于市价供给群众必需品，较高于市价收买了农产品，因而减轻了商业资本的中间剥削。
    此外，在灾区组织了灾民生产渡灾及预购胡麻等工作。龙关、延庆、崇礼、怀柔等县，去年遭敌灾及风、雹、旱等天灾，群众生活生产上存在严重困难，供销社大量收购该地区的特产品——药材。截至六月十五日止，在该四县已收购药材三十四万四千二百二十二斤，换出粮食十五万八千六百九十四斤，食盐二千一百六十斤，部分解决了灾民在夏锄中的生活困难。
    在试办中，也发生了许多偏向，主要是在货物定价上相当普遍的发生了恩赐观点，亏损了国家资金。少数供销社资金使用不灵活，长期积存物资。如龙关供销社，规定洋布卖社员六十元一尺，非社员八十元，而当时市价是一百元。赤城供销社规定麻油一斤卖社员一百廿元，而当时市价一百八十元。延庆供销社长期存放小米十余万斤，怀来供销社存放土布数千匹。这种过分压低物价与长期存压物资的做法，使供销社资金受损与周转不灵，影响业务发展。在业务经营上缺乏企业化的精神，营业人员过多，经费开支过大。
