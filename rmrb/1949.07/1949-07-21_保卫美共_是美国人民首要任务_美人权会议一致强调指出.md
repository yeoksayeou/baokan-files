Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 20th: TASS, New York - At the plenary and panel sessions of the American Human Rights Conference on July 17th, speakers emphasized that defending the American Communist Party from being destroyed by the trial of its leaders by pro-fascist elements is the first line of defense for the democratic rights of all American people. Congressman Marcantonio of the American Labor Party emphasized in his speech that defending the Communist Party is the most important task of the American people. He said, "I openly condemn the accusation against the Communist Party as the result of a conspiracy by arrogant politicians playing dangerous fascist tricks." Gates, one of the accused leaders of the American Communist Party, spoke at a panel session about the trial of Communist Party leaders, saying, "The accusation and trial themselves are monstrous lies that Hitler once used." Gates called for crushing the evil conspiracy of American reactionaries to establish a police state in the United States. Winter, the leader of the Communist Party of Michigan, said that the Human Rights Guarantee Conference "demonstrates the united spirit of resistance of the American people."
