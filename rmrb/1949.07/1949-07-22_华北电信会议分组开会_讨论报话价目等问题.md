　　North China Telecommunications Conference Holds Group Meetings
  　Discussing Telegraph and Telephone Rates and Other Issues
    [This newspaper reports] The North China Telecommunications Conference has been holding group discussions daily from the 13th to the 19th. To facilitate the discussion and study of relevant issues, the conference established five groups: Business, Finance, Engineering and Materials, Personnel and Cadres, and Military Region Local Communications, produced by the general assembly to conduct research separately. Over the past seven days, the meeting has progressed rapidly, and the issues raised by each group have been more specific and clear. The Business Group proposed: (1) Should bureaus be established in important towns along the long-distance trunk lines? After preliminary discussion, it was considered that bureaus should be established as much as possible in important towns along the trunk lines that are not too far from the trunk lines, can be taken care of by the central bureau, and have needs in the area, to facilitate external communication in these towns. At present, it is temporarily impossible to implement a business operation mode for the communications networks of prefectures, districts, townships, and counties below the original special commissioner's office. When it is necessary to pass through the trunk lines of the state-owned communications network, a line crossing fee will be charged. (2) How should telegraph and telephone rates be determined? After preliminary discussion, the telegraph pricing will be temporarily divided into two categories, intra-provincial and inter-provincial, for calculation purposes. For neighboring provinces, if the distance between the two bureaus is relatively short, the rate will be calculated as intra-provincial within a certain distance range. During the period when the national economy and finance have not yet been fully unified, it is tentatively planned to set prices based on the liberated areas as units, and uniformity will not be forced immediately, but efforts should be made to achieve uniformity within the North China region. For long-distance telephone pricing, the latitude and longitude difference calculation method will still be used for long distances (over 100 kilometers); for distances within 100 kilometers, the starting price will be reduced, and the rate will still be calculated every 20 kilometers. The proposals discussed by the Engineering and Materials Group were: (1) Unifying the allocation of frequency bands occupied by various radio stations and offices in North China (excluding military stations); (2) Calibrating the frequency of radio signals transmitted by various bureaus and stations in North China; (3) Reforming the organization of long-distance telephone lines, establishing engineering sections, and improving work efficiency; (4) Long-distance telecommunications line engineering teams are directly under the district management bureau to improve work efficiency and other issues. In accordance with the spirit of the Labor Union resolution, the Personnel and Cadres Group, in order to improve production efficiency and encourage the progress of employees, formulated preliminary opinions on adjusting employee salaries based on the principle of "more work, more pay," as a basis for off-site research by various units. Furthermore, at 8:00 p.m. on the 20th, the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Trade Union held a welcome reception for attendees from various locations at the auditorium of the Normal University outside Hepingmen, with various entertainment programs performed.

    [Another News Item] In order to allow attendees from various locations to have a deeper understanding of modern telecommunications equipment, the Telecommunications Administration has specially set up a "Telecommunications Industry Exhibition" within the Administration. It is divided into seven departments, including various types of telegraph transceivers. There are specialists to explain and demonstrate the methods of use, but it is not open to the general public.

　　华北电信会议分组开会
  　讨论报话价目等问题
    【本报讯】华北电信会议从十三日起，至十九日止，连日分组讨论。该会为便于讨论并研究有关问题，由大会产生业务、财务、工务器材、人事干部与军区地方通信五组，分别研讨。七日来，会议进行颇为迅速，各组所提出的问题均较具体明确。业务组提出：（一）长途干线沿途重要城镇是否设局？经初步讨论，认为凡通过干线之沿途重要城镇，在离干线不太远、总局能够照顾、而该地又有需要者，并为易于维护线路，应尽量设局，以便利这些城镇的对外联系。原专署以下区乡县通讯网，目前暂不可能实行企业经营方式，在有必要通过国营通讯网之干线时，照收过线费。（二）报话价目如何订定？经初步讨论，电报订价暂先划分全国为本省与省际两类计算之办法，邻省两局相距较近者，在一定距离范围内，按本省计费。在目前全国财经尚未完全统一期间，暂拟以解放区为单位订定，不即强求一律，但在华北区内部应设法求其统一。长途电话之订定，凡属远距离（一百公里以上）者，仍采经纬度差计算方法；一百公里以内者，将起点价目降低，仍按每二十公里计算。工务器材组讨论的提案为：（一）统一划分华北各种无线电台事务所占用之波段（军台除外）；（二）校正华北各局台所发无线电信号之周率；（三）改革长途电话机线组织，成立工务段，增进工作效能；（四）长途电信线路工程队直属区管局提高工作效率等问题。人事干部组根据劳大决议的精神，为着提高生产效率及鼓励员工的进步，对于员工薪资的规定，依据多劳多得的原则，拟定了员工薪资调整的初步意见，作为各单位会外的研究。又二十日晚八时北平市电信局职工会在和平门外师范大学礼堂，欢迎各地出席人员，有各种游艺节目的演出。

    【又讯】电信总局为了使各地出席会议人员对现代化电信设备作深一步了解起见，特在总局内筹设了一个“电信工业展览会”。内分各式电报收发机等七个部门。有专人讲解，试验使用方法，但不招待一般市民。
