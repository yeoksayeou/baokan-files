　　Japanese National Industry on the Verge of Bankruptcy, Yoshida Government Betrays Promises to Serve Monopoly Capital
　　--Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party
　　(Continued from page two of this newspaper on the 7th, to be concluded)
　　(VII) The Consequences of the Democratic Liberal Party's Policies
　　The Yoshida government has almost completely abandoned disaster recovery work. The total recovery and future construction costs for mountain and river management require 150 billion yen, but only 15% of what is needed is included in the budget. Secondly, the government says it has no money, but the government has 34 billion yen in current deposits at the Bank of Japan. These abundant funds are used for monopoly capital, but they leave small and medium-sized enterprises and national enterprises in ruin. In response to this policy of the Democratic Liberal Party, national defense conferences have been held in various places, proposing to fight monopoly capital, with national capital and workers joining hands to fight against the government together. Thirdly, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries are also collapsing. The damage caused by the devastation of the land and the price policies for agricultural and aquatic products, which are insufficient to cover production costs, are making agriculture, forestry, and fisheries increasingly impoverished. At the same time, as a result of the reversal of land reform, the number of land recovery incidents, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, is slightly less than 100,000, but in reality, it is likely to be close to one million. This year's tax revenue is even heavier than in the past. Last summer ploughing season, 50,000 farming households abandoned 25,000 chō (each chō is equivalent to more than 16 Chinese mu -- translator) of land. The result of not having food and giving up production gives foreign capital the power of life and death. The buying and selling of people is prevalent in rural areas. Children around the age of twelve are sold for only about 2,000 yen, with contracts lasting three to five years. These phenomena mainly occur in the agricultural areas of Tohoku and Hokuriku, with no less than 10,000 people bought and sold in a year. Fishermen are also facing a complete collapse.
　　(VIII) The Poverty of Workers and the Government's Suppression of Workers
　　According to the official white paper, workers' wages are rising. But in reality, they are falling. For example, after the Civil Servants Law was established, the basic wage for all civil servants was 6,300 yen, but due to the extension of working hours, the actual basic wage was only 4,300 yen. According to statistics from January and February of this year, more than half of the civil servants earn less than 1,000 yen. Production has increased to 60% of pre-war levels, and if the textile industry is excluded, it is 96% of pre-war levels. Wages are only 37% of pre-war levels. It is very clear how the government serves the big capitalists. The average worker's family of fewer than four people has a monthly deficit of 4,000 to 5,000 yen, and the late or non-payment of wages is a very common phenomenon. Secondly, the Democratic Liberal Party is preparing to lay off 20% to 30% of employees through enterprise and administrative adjustments, which further promotes the bankruptcy of national capital and small and medium-sized enterprises. It is estimated that there are currently about 3 million unemployed people and about 10 million potential unemployed people. The rate of accidents due to increased labor intensity has increased. Taking coal mines as an example, in the first half of 1948, the number of injured workers increased from 30,000 to 67,000 compared with the same period in 1947.
　　On the other hand, the salaries of police officers and prison staff have increased by 50%, and there have been no layoffs. The budget in this area has been increased. The police fee alone has increased by 10 billion yen. Police Chief Suzuki violently suppressed the demonstrations of the Industrial Labor Union Federation and the Labor General Federation in Osaka on March 27 and April 3. He ordered: "Eradicate all obstacles," "Kill without mercy those who speak against us," which aroused the anger and protest of the citizens of Osaka. The government did nothing about this, but instead fueled this situation.
　　(IX) Destroying Culture and Education
　　Cultural figures are writing articles to pay taxes, and they have become skin and bones. Teachers are busy looking for side jobs. The number of students attending school has been reduced to a quarter, and almost all of them are looking for side jobs to pay tuition fees. Regarding the budget for implementing the 6-3 system of education (i.e., a six-year elementary school, and a three-year junior high school and high school -- translator), 78.8 billion yen was originally proposed, but only 2.6 billion yen was approved. From elementary school to university, the content of education has been reduced to colonial education. We advocate abolishing all expenditures that benefit monopoly capital, and expenditures to improve the people's culture and education have priority.
　　(X) Overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet
　　The Yoshida cabinet not only cannot stabilize politics, economy, and society, but makes them more chaotic. If the cabinet cannot fulfill its promises, it should get out. However, in order to cover up the mistakes of his policies, Yoshida said that we are saboteurs and declared that he would carry out suppression. Yoshida set up an examination committee, trampled on the human rights guaranteed by the constitution, and even attempted to set up a non-Japanese committee. These are enough to show their traitorous nature of relying on foreign capital and their comprador nature of living on foreign favors. Yoshida practices autocratic dictatorship within the party and suppresses freedom-loving people outside the party, showing his fascist nature of loyalty to monopoly capital. Only by overthrowing the Yoshida cabinet and establishing a people's democratic government can the Japanese nation be saved. (Translated by Zhuang Tao)

　　日本民族工业濒于破产，吉田政府背弃诺言为独占资本服务     
    ——日本共产党总书记德田球一
    （接七日本报二版、续完）
    （七）民主自由党政策的结果
    吉田政府几乎完全放弃了灾害的恢复工作，治山、治水的恢复费及为将来的建设费合计共需一千五百亿圆，然列入预算的仅为所需的百分之十五。其次，政府说没有钱，但政府在日本银行的活期存款就有三百四十亿圆。这样丰富的资金是为独占资本而使用的，但却使中小企业、民族企业陷于荒废。对于民主自由党这一政策，各地召开了民族防卫大会，提出和独占资本斗争，民族资本和工人提携，共同为反对政府而斗争。第三，农林、渔业也正在崩溃。因国土荒废而遭受的打击及不足偿付生产费的农、水产物的价格政策，使农林、渔业日益贫困。同时，土地改革逆行的结果，收回土地的事件据农林省发表为十万件弱，实际上恐将近百万件。今年税收比过去更为繁重。去年夏耕时，有五万户农民放弃二万五千町（每町约合中国十六亩多——译者）土地。没有食粮而又放弃生产的结果，使外资握有生死之权。农村中盛行买卖人口。十二岁左右的儿童，订立三年至五年卖身契的，只卖二千圆左右。这些现象主要发生在东北、北陆的农作地带，一年间买卖的人口不下一万人。渔民也面临全面崩溃的危机。
    （八）工人的贫困和政府对工人的镇压
    根据官方白皮书所载，工人的工资是向上的。但实际上却是下降的。例如公务员法成立后，全体公务员的基准工资是六千三百圆，但由于工作时间的延长，实质上基准工资只有四千三百圆。据今年一、二月的统计，有半数以上的公务员的薪水在一千圆以下。生产增至战前百分之六十，若除去纺织业，则为战前的百分之九十六。工资仅为战前的百分之三十七。政府如何为大资本家服务，是很清楚的。平均不到四人的工人家庭，每月亏空四千圆至五千圆，而且工资的迟发或不发是很普遍的现象。其次，民主自由党从企业调整与行政调整中，准备裁员百分之二十至三十，这样更促进了民族资本与中小企业的破产。目前失业者估计约三百万人，潜在失业者约一千万人。因劳动强度提高而发生事故的比率增高了，以煤矿为例，一九四八年上半期较一九四七年同期受害工人由三万人增至六万七千人。
    另一方面，警官与监狱职员的薪俸增加了百分之五十，而且也没有裁员。这方面的预算是增加的。仅就警察费一项，就增加了一百亿圆。铃木警察局长对大坂三月二十七日与四月三日产业劳动组合联合会与劳动总同盟的示威，实行暴烈镇压。他下令说：“铲除一切障碍”，“言是非者格杀勿论”，引起大坂市民的愤激抗议。政府对此毫无处置，反而助长这种情势。
    （九）破坏文化教育
    文化人为纳税而写文章，已经弄得皮包骨头。教员忙于找寻副业。上学学生减至四分之一，几乎都是为了付学费而寻求副业。关于实行六三制教育（按即小学六年，初、高中各三年的学制——译者）的预算，本来提出七百八十八亿圆，结果仅批准二十六亿圆。从小学至大学，教育内容已下降为殖民地的教育。我们主张废止一切有利于独占资本的支出，为了提高人民文化教育的支出有优先权。
    （十）打倒吉田内阁
    吉田内阁不但不能使政治、经济、社会得到安定，反而使其更加混乱。内阁如果不能履行诺言，就应滚蛋。可是吉田为了掩饰自己政策的错误，反说我们是破坏者，声明要进行镇压。吉田设立考查委员会，蹂躏为宪法所保障的人权，甚至企图设立非日委员会。这些足以说明他们依存外国资本的卖国性及依靠外国施惠而生活的买办性。吉田在党内实行专制独裁，在党外弹压爱好自由的人们，显示其效忠于独占资本的法西斯本质。只有打倒吉田内阁，建立人民民主政府，才能拯救日本民族。（庄涛译）　　　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社北平七日电】
