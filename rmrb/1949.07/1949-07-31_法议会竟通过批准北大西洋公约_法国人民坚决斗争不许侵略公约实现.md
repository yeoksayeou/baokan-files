Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 30th: Reports from various sources: The French National Assembly and Senate passed the approval of the North Atlantic Treaty on the 27th and 29th respectively. French Communist Party members and some members belonging to the government party and the Republican Union of Progress voted against it. According to l'Humanité, the widespread protest movement against the North Atlantic Treaty launched by the progressive people of France has now turned into a mass movement to prevent the implementation of the treaty due to the passage of the treaty by the National Assembly and the Senate. l'Humanité pointed out that the mass movement against the North Atlantic Treaty, uniting workers, peasants, working people of all trades, and people with different political views, is progressing in France. The newspaper analyzed that peace advocates have gained allies from broad social strata in this struggle. The debate in the National Assembly proved that even the initiators of the treaty showed hesitation and confusion. l'Humanité called on the French people to seize the opportunity to make greater efforts to prevent the implementation of the treaty.
