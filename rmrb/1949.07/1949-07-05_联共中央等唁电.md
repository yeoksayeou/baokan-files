　　联共中央等唁电
    【新华社北平四日电】据塔斯社讯：季米特洛夫逝世后，苏联共产党中央委员会、部长会议最高苏维埃主席团主席及外交部长，分别致电保加利亚共产党中央委员会，部长会议、人民共和国国民会议主席团主席与外交部长，深表哀悼。联共中央致保共中央的唁电称：“苏联共产党中央委员会对国际工人阶级运动的卓越领袖、保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民的领袖季米特洛夫同志的逝世深表悲痛。季米特洛夫同志的逝世，使保加利亚工人阶级和保加利亚共产党失去了他们的战斗的领袖，失去了争取共产主义胜利的坚定的斗士，失去了久经锻炼的、领导保加利亚人民经历严重的考验岁月而向人民民主革命的胜利前进的政治领袖。苏联人民的忠实的朋友季米特洛夫同志高举着无产阶级国际主义和保、苏人民友谊的旗帜，他把这种友谊看作保加利亚的繁荣、自由和独立的基础。季米特洛夫同志的光辉的人格，将永远为争取社会主义的胜利、争取各民族间的和平、争取苏联和保加利亚人民共和国间的不可摧毁的友谊的斗争，树立感召性的范例。
