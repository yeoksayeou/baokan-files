　　Foreign Mail Arrives in Tianjin and Beiping
　　[Report from this newspaper] In order to ensure the smooth flow of national and international mail, the North China Postal Administration, after the postal blockade announced by the traitor He Yingqin, immediately instructed the Tianjin Bureau to negotiate with Taikoo and Jardine Matheson shipping companies. The agreement allowed the company's Tianjin-Hong Kong ships to carry mail from Guangzhou and other unliberated areas, as well as overseas mail. According to a telegram from Taikoo Shipping Company on June 15th and a telegram from the Hong Kong Post Office, the domestic mail from North China destined for the Jiang-controlled areas and overseas has been forwarded as planned. It was also said that arrangements would be made to transport Hong Kong mail to Tianjin via the Hanyang vessel. It is now learned that the vessel arrived in Tianjin on July 1st, bringing 59 bags of mail, 31 bags for the Tianjin Bureau and 28 bags for the Beiping Bureau. Among the 28 bags for the Beiping Bureau, there were 12 bags from San Francisco, 12 bags from London, and 8 bags from New York. The mail handed over to the Tianjin Bureau also included items from Canada and other places. From now on, postal communication between North China and domestic and foreign locations has been unblocked.
