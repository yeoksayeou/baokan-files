　　Henan University Relocates Back to Kaifeng
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 20th] The former Henan University has completely relocated back to Kaifeng and will officially resume classes in the coming days. During the first liberation of Kaifeng in June of last year, some students, led by professors such as Ji Wenfu from the university, entered the liberated areas for study and work. The majority of the remaining faculty, staff, students, and workers were forcibly moved to Suzhou by the Kuomintang reactionary government. In recent years, they have suffered persecution from the Kuomintang reactionaries, experiencing hardship and academic stagnation. After the liberation of Suzhou, in early June, the Henan Provincial People's Government decided to rebuild Henan University and sent personnel to Suzhou to welcome the university back to Bian (Kaifeng). Currently, with the exception of over a thousand students who voluntarily requested to stay in the liberated areas of Jiangnan for work and study, the remaining faculty, students, staff, and their families, totaling over two thousand people, have all returned to Kaifeng. Over 80,000 books and physical, chemical, and medical instruments have also been completely and intactly transported back with the assistance of the government. The returning faculty and students received a warm welcome and care from the People's Government. The Henan Provincial Department of Education and the Kaifeng Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education are actively helping them settle their food and lodging and planning for the resumption of classes.

　　河南大学迁返开封
    【新华社开封二十日电】前河南大学已全部迁回开封，日内即可正式复课。该校于去年六月开封第一次解放时，部分学生曾在该校嵇文甫等教授率领下，进入解放区学习和工作，其余大部分教职员、学生和工友则被国民党反动政府强迫迁至苏州，年来备受国民党反动派迫害，生活痛苦，学业荒废。苏州解放后，六月初旬，河南省人民政府决议重建河南大学，并派专人赴苏迎接该校返汴。现该校除有千余学员自动要求留江南解放区工作和学习外，其余师生职工及眷属两千余人，已全部返抵开封。图书八万余册及理化、医疗仪器等亦在政府协助下，全部完整运回。返汴师生得到人民政府的热烈欢迎与照顾，河南省教育厅，汴市文教局正积极帮他们安置食宿，筹划复课。
