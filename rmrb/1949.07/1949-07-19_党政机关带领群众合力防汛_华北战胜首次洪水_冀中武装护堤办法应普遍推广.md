Party and Government Organs Lead the Masses to Jointly Fight Floods
North China Overcomes First Flood
Armed Dike Protection Method in Central Hebei Should be Widely Promoted
Oppose Complacency, Prevent Greater Floods from Coming

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Under the leadership of party and government organs, the people of North China have overcome the first flood of this year and are continuing to actively prepare for a complete victory in this year's flood prevention. Since late June, there have been continuous rains, with rainfall covering both mountainous and plain areas. The characteristic of this rainfall is its widespread and concentrated nature. For example, in the Sanjiadian area, from July 1st to 10th, the rainfall totaled 300 mm within 79 hours, accounting for 44.5% of the annual average rainfall of 674 mm. In Baoding, there were two periods of rainfall totaling 112 mm within 40 hours on July 7th to 9th, accounting for 22% of the annual average rainfall of 510 mm. Moreover, because the rainfall in the mountains was greater than in the plains, it caused the first significant flood of this year. The Yongding River swelled twice on June 28th and July 4th. Some sections of the embankment in the Changxindian area collapsed but were promptly repaired, preventing further expansion. The river surged again on July 8th. In the Liangxiang section, the right bank overflowed in two places, and the beach collapsed in one place. However, through the active efforts of cadres and the masses to repair sub-dikes and plant willows, no disaster occurred. The Liangxiang section of the river is currently strengthening the construction of fascine dams and repairing sub-dikes to prepare for the second flood. The Hutuo River surged on the 8th, exceeding last year's highest water level, and overflowed and breached in many places. Except for the south bank levee, which had been decided to abandon in consideration of the overall situation, the Langren breach on the north bank was blocked by the 12th, preventing a major disaster. After the 9th, the water level continuously dropped. The Guantai dangerous section of the Yellow River in Quhe County experienced subaqueous movement of the second and third dams on June 27th due to changes in the scouring pattern. After seven days and nights of repair in the rain, the dams were one meter above the water surface on July 7th. Nine dangerous sections in Gao Cun, Zhu Kou, Liu Zhuang, and @ Shan are being repaired. On July 5th, the Baodi Guzhuang breach on the right bank of the Jiyun River was eight zhang wide, and by the 14th, it had widened to twenty zhang, with a water depth of one zhang and five chi, inundating more than 100,000 mu of land and affecting 60 villages. Repairs are currently underway on the Xinlin Road (from Xinan Town to Lintingkou) to prevent the flood from encroaching westward. The North China Water Conservancy Commission has instructed to first contain the ends of the breach to prevent it from continuing to widen, while actively preparing materials and seeking opportunities to block the breach. Personnel have been dispatched to assist. The North Canal and Longfeng Canal also experienced rapid rises, with bank collapses and nine instances of dangerous conditions. Except for the dangerous conditions within Wuqing County, which have been assigned to the Yongding River Flood Control Headquarters of Central Hebei for repair, the Water Conservancy Commission has telegraphed the Eastern Hebei Headquarters to quickly repair and defend the dangerous conditions within Eastern Hebei. Overall, except for the Guzhuang breach of the Jiyun River, which inundated more than 100,000 mu of land, other rivers did not cause major disasters during this flood.

During this flood prevention effort, the general cadres and masses implemented the spirit of the North China Government's instructions on this year's flood prevention work, deeply recognizing the importance of flood prevention. Leading cadres at all levels of the party, government, and military personally took the lead, leading the masses to repair and protect the dikes. For example, the situation at the Guantai dangerous section of the Yellow River was extremely critical, but thanks to the leading cadres at all levels and departments leading the laborers to rescue the dams overnight in the face of gales and rainstorms, the danger was averted after seven days of effort. The Central Hebei District Party Committee proactively convened responsible comrades from the administrative office and the flood prevention headquarters to promptly gather information, analyze the water situation, and study countermeasures, demonstrating a high degree of attention to flood prevention work. The Ninth Special District of Central Hebei also paid attention to preventing sabotage by bandits and special agents, and organized the masses to arm themselves to protect the dikes. Therefore, although this year's first flood was large, it did not cause a major disaster. However, some areas did not pay enough attention to pre-flood inspections and patrols of the dikes. For example, more than ten days after the Guzhuang breach of the Jiyun River, the cause of the breach had not yet been determined, indicating that the river's headquarters had failed to organize the inspection and guard work of the dikes effectively in advance. If someone had been guarding the dike at the time, this breach might have been avoided. The first flood prevention effort revealed that some areas were still inadequately prepared. Some radio and telephone installations were installed too late, so that upstream and downstream could not communicate water conditions in a timely manner after the flood arrived. Some river sections did not build temporary shelters in time, and flood workers did not universally go to the dikes. Some of those who went to the dikes did not bring all their furniture and did not pay attention to repairing the dikes. These phenomena should also be thoroughly checked and corrected in the future. Now the first battle against the flood has been won. However, we must pay attention to preventing the harmful idea of "the first flood is big, the second flood is small" that may arise among some cadres and the masses, and seriously summarize the advantages and disadvantages of this flood prevention effort to educate cadres and the masses. At the same time, we must continue to actively strengthen preparation, inspection, and repair work to welcome the second flood and strive for a complete victory in this year's flood prevention work.

    党政机关带领群众合力防汛
    华北战胜首次洪水
    冀中武装护堤办法应普遍推广
    反对麻痹，预防更大的洪水袭来
    【本报特讯】华北各地人民在党政机关领导下，已战胜今年第一次洪水，并在继续积极准备，以争取今年防汛的彻底胜利。六月下旬以来，阴雨连绵，降雨地带遍及山地平原。此次降雨特点是地区普遍水量集中。如三家店一带，自七月一日到十日，前后七十九小时内降雨量共达三○○公厘，占年平均降水量六七四公厘的百分之四四·五。保定在七月七日到九日前后二次共四十小时内降雨一一二公厘，占年平均降水量五一○公厘的百分之二二。又因山地雨量较平原为大，造成今年的第一次颇大的洪水。永定河在六月二十八日及七月四日，曾两度涨水，上游长辛店区段部分坝岸坍塌，均已抢护，未再扩大，七月八日起水又猛涨；良乡境河段右岸两处漫水，一处滩岸坍塌不已；经干部群众积极抢修子埝、挂柳，并未成灾。该河良乡段刻正加强埽坝，培修子埝，准备迎接第二次洪水。滹沱河在八日猛涨，超过去年最高水位，多处漫溢溃决。其中除南岸堤防由于照顾全局早已决定放弃外，北岸郎仁决口至十二日以前即已堵好，漫水不多，未成大灾。九日以后，水即连续下落。黄河曲河县贯台险工因溜势变化，第二、三坝于六月二十七日下蛰入水，经七昼夜冒雨抢修，七月七日已抢出水面一公尺。高村、朱口、刘庄、＠山等处险工共有九处埽坝下蛰，有的大部入水，正抢修中。蓟运河七月五日右岸宝坻沽庄决口八丈，十四日冲宽至二十丈，水深一丈五尺，已淹地十多万亩，六十个村庄受灾，现正抢修新林路（新安镇至林亭口）以防洪水西浸，华北水利委员会并已指示先裹住坝头，防止决口继续冲宽，同时积极备料，相机修堵，现正派人前往协助。北运、龙凤等河水亦暴涨，堤岸坍塌，发生险工九处，除武清境内险工已由冀中令永定河防汛指挥部负责抢修外，水委会已电告翼东指挥部迅速修防冀东境内险工。总起来说，此次洪水侵袭，除蓟运河沽庄决口淹地十余万亩外，其他各河均未成大灾。
    在此次防汛中，一般干部群众都贯彻了华北政府关于本年防汛工作指示的精神，深刻认识了防汛的重要。各级党政军主要干部都能亲自带头，率领群众上堤修护。如黄河贯台险工，情况至为危急，但由于各级各部门主要干部冒着急风暴雨率领民工连夜抢救，经过七天的努力，终于化险为夷。冀中区党委主动地邀集行署及防汛总指挥部负责同志，及时汇集情况，分析水情，研究对策，表现了对防汛工作的高度重视。冀中九专还注意到防止匪特破坏，组织群众武装护堤，因此，今年第一场洪水虽大，仍未成大灾。也有个别地区对汛前检查，汛期巡守堤防重视不够，如蓟运河在沽庄决口后，十余天尚未查明决口原因，说明该河指挥部事先未能很好地组织堤防的检查守护工作。如果当时有人沿堤防守，可能避免了这次决口。第一次防汛工作表现有些地区准备工作仍不够，部分电台、电话按设太迟，以致洪水到后，上下游不能及时联络水情。有些河段没有及时搭设窝铺，汛工也没普遍上堤，已经上堤的，有的携带家具不全，未能注意修整工作等现象，今后亦应切实检查纠正。现在第一次和洪水的斗争已胜利了。但必须注意防止在某些干部群众中可能产生的“头场水大二场水小”的有害思想，认真总结此次防汛的优缺点，以此教育干部群众，同时继续积极加强准备检查修整工作，迎接第二次洪水，为今年防汛工作的彻底胜利而奋斗。
