　　Worker Li Tianfu
  　Refines Pure Oil from Greasy Waste
    [Taihang Telegraph] Li Tianfu, a warehouse worker at the Shaoming Coal Mine in Neiqiu, has successfully experimented with refining pure oil from machine grease. Every 100 jin of grease can yield 50 jin of pure oil, significantly contributing to material conservation and cost reduction. Li Tianfu is from Lin County, Henan, and has a peasant background. After arriving at the Shaoming Mine last September, he noticed that the mine treated large quantities of machine grease as waste, selling it to soap factories at a very low price (2,250 Jiao currency per jin) to make soap. He felt this was a great waste. He had heard at home that this material could be boiled into oil. He thought: If it could be refined into good oil, it would save the government a lot of money. He secretly searched for materials like alum, brine, and alkali from fellow villagers to refine pure oil. After finding the materials, he began experimenting on March 30th. He added and adjusted the materials while boiling, and after boiling for an hour, clear oil floated to the top. Everyone praised and admired him. The method for boiling the oil is as follows: 12 jin of water, 6 qian of alkali, 6 qian of alum, and 0.5 jin of brine are placed in a pot and boiled to dissolve. Then, 28 jin of grease are added. When the mixed liquid in the pot is about to boil, add 9 round blue stone eggs. Then, simmer over low heat until the water is boiled away, then turn off the heat. The top layer is oil, the middle layer is oil residue, and there is still some oil at the bottom. The oil extracted the first time still contains some residue, but after refining it a second time, it becomes pure oil.

　　工人李天福
  　用油腻炼纯油
    【太行电】内邱邵明煤矿仓库杂工李天福，利用机器油腻试验提炼纯油成功。每百斤油腻可提炼纯油五十斤，在节省材料、减低成本上起了不少作用。李天福系河南林县人，农民出身，去年九月到邵明矿后，看见矿上把大批的机器油腻，当作废物，以很贱的价钱（每斤冀钞二千二百五十元）卖给肥皂厂做了肥皂，他觉得很可惜，他在家时曾听说过此物可以熬油，他想：如能熬成好油，给公家就能省很多钱。他自己曾悄悄的到老乡家找寻提炼纯油的材料白矾、卤水、碱等。材料找到后，即于三月三十日开始试熬。他一边熬一边加配材料，熬过一个钟头后清清的油浮在上面了。大家都很称赞佩服他。熬油的办法是：水十二斤，碱六钱，白矾六钱，卤水半斤，放入锅内沸化后放油腻二十八斤，待锅内混合液体即将开沸时，再放青石圆蛋九个，即用慢火熬，将水熬完后即可熄火，上面即是油，中间是油渣子，下面还有点油。第一次泊出的油，里面还有些渣子，再经过泊一次，即成了纯油。
