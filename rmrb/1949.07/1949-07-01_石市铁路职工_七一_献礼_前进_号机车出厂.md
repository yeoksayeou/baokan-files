　　Shijiazhuang Railway Workers Present "July 1st" Gift
  　"Forward" Locomotive Leaves Factory
    [Shijiazhuang Electric] To commemorate "July 1st," the workers of the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory completed the "Forward" locomotive, the "New China" passenger car, four freight cars named "Unity," "Mutual Aid," "Victory," and "Success," and three bridges named "Competition" with high labor enthusiasm. A grand departure ceremony was held on the 27th. The "New China" passenger car was originally a damaged car bombed by enemy planes. The frame was bent into a convex shape, and the car body and accessories were completely destroyed. It had been lying in the scrap pile for more than half a year. In this competition, the workers decided to repair this car in addition to completing the original production plan, as a gift to "July 1st." The other four freight cars were also picked out from scrap materials. Because they were successfully completed with the unity and mutual assistance of the factory workers, they were named "Unity," "Mutual Aid," "Victory," and "Success." The three bridges were also products outside the competition plan. At the departure ceremony, Mayor Liu Xiufeng said that the workers had gloriously completed and exceeded the production plan due to increased awareness, and had made many inventions, which was worthy of praise. The rationalization of labor organization and the improvement of various systems after the implementation of democratic factory management are the main reasons for this achievement.

　　石市铁路职工“七一”献礼
  　“前进”号机车出厂
    【石家庄电】石家庄铁路机厂职工为纪念“七一”，以高度劳动热忱完成“前进”号机车，和“新中国”客车，“团结”、“互助”、“胜利”、“成功”等四辆货车，“竞赛”号三座桥梁，于二十七日隆重举行出厂典礼。“新中国号”客车，原为被敌机炸毁的破车，车架倾斜成凸字形，车身和附属装置全部毁了，在废堆中躺了半年多。这次竞赛中，职工们决定除完成原订生产计划外，义务加班修理好这辆车，作为对“七一”的献礼。其他四辆货车也是从废料中挑出来的，因是在机厂职工们团结互助下胜利完成的，所以命名为“团结”、“互助”、“胜利”、“成功”。三座桥梁也是竞赛计划外的产品。出厂典礼大会上，市长刘秀峰同志认为由于职工觉悟提高，光荣地完成并超过了生产计划，并有许多创造发明，是值得表扬的。而开展工厂民主管理后，劳动组织的合理化，和各种制度的健全，更是这次获得成绩的主要原因。
