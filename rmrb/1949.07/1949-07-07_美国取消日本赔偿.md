　　US Cancels Japanese Reparations
　　Chen Hanbo
　　The Potsdam Declaration regarding Japan, promulgated on July 26, 1945, stipulated: "Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those industries which would enable her to re-arm for war." The Far Eastern Commission's basic policy toward Japan, published on June 20, 1947, affirmed: "Only industries that maintain Japan's democratic economy and pay reparations in kind shall be allowed to develop, while industries that enable Japan to rearm shall absolutely not be permitted to exist." On August 14, 1947, the Far Eastern Commission passed a resolution to reduce Japan's military industrial potential, specifically stipulating the following principles regarding Japanese reparations: "All basic and secondary war industries should be designated as reparations."

　　These declarations, policies, and resolutions are written clearly, stating that Japan must fulfill reparations, and all of Japan's war industries must be dismantled and transferred as reparations. However, the actions taken by the United States on the issue of Japanese reparations for nearly four years have completely contradicted the aforementioned principles.

　　The first American plan regarding Japanese reparations was the Pauley Plan. In November 1945, a delegation led by Pauley arrived in Japan. Based on plans drafted separately by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, he published a plan. The main content was to divide Japanese industry into three categories: 1. Military industries, such as aluminum production, manganese production, synthetic rubber, etc., were to be completely dismantled and used as reparations; 2. Important industries, such as electricity, shipbuilding, steel, steelmaking, steel refining, machine tool manufacturing, transportation equipment, etc., were to be partially dismantled and allocated as reparations; 3. Basic industries, such as textiles, raw silk, leather making, cement, building materials, lumbering, pottery, coal mines, gold and silver mines, diesel mines, crude rubber manufacturing, light electrical materials, and the extraction of zinc, aluminum, tin, and sulfide ores, etc., were to be entirely retained and not used as reparations. This plan was not only too lenient but also partially preserved Japan's war industries under the guise of important industrial projects. For example, the plan stipulated that Japan could produce 2.5 million tons of steel annually, maintain 1.5 million tons of ships, and be allowed to build 150,000 tons of new ships and repair 3 million tons annually. Subsequently, in August 1946, MacArthur Headquarters, in accordance with the temporary reparations dismantling plan passed by the Far Eastern Commission, designated 1,090 factories as reparations. In April 1947, the US government unilaterally ordered MacArthur to allocate 30 percent of the factories designated above to China (the then Kuomintang government), the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom first. This was the so-called "temporary reparations plan." However, soon after, MacArthur reduced the 1,090 factories he had designated as reparations to 934. The number of aircraft factories originally designated for dismantling was 447, which was reduced to 334. Twenty-four underground aircraft factories were eliminated. The number of privately owned munitions factories originally designated for dismantling was 273, which was later reduced to 235. In early 1948, it was further reduced to 845, including 45 Nakajima aircraft factories and 20 Hatano heavy tank factories that were eliminated. At the same time, MacArthur approved 500 of the 845 factories to be operated by the Japanese and to start work in their original locations, which was equivalent to being eliminated as well. The repeated reduction in the number of factories designated as reparations naturally reduced the number stipulated in the so-called "temporary reparations plan." In fact, to date, only 18 factories have been dismantled and used as reparations.

　　In 1947, Strake, Assistant Secretary of the US Army Department and President of McLoy & Company, and his party arrived in Japan three times. The targets of their investigation had already expanded to investigating Japan's industrial potential, the industrial equipment needed for Japan's economic recovery, and the industrial assets that Japan could provide as war reparations. Strake published an anti-reparations article titled "Retribution is Waste," arguing that reparations hindered Japan's economic recovery and suggesting abandoning reparations. In February 1948, the US Army Department published a report estimating Japanese industrial reparations (commonly known as the Strake Plan), stipulating that the reparations amount would be $412.04 million. This was a 70 percent reduction compared to the reparations amount stipulated in the Pauley Plan. The plan also stipulated that "except for major war industries, do not remove Japan's production equipment." The so-called "major war industries" that could be removed were actually a big lie; aluminum, magnesium, petroleum, and certain chemical industries were still retained by MacArthur. And secondary war industries were openly preserved.

　　By the time of the Draper Plan, it had taken a step further than the previous plans, with the central content becoming an attempt to completely preserve and restore Japan's military industry by canceling reparations. Draper, former Under Secretary of the US Army Department, led a group of individuals related to American monopoly capital to Japan for investigation and published a report in May 1948 (this report was drafted by Johnston, former chairman of Chemical Bank, a member of the group, so it is also known as the Johnston Plan). It advocated that Japan's reparations amount be over $165 million, with the main points being: 1. MacArthur Headquarters could freely dispose of reparations related to Japan's military industry and could replace military industries included in the reparations projects with other equivalent production volumes. It also explicitly stipulated that nitric acid, aluminum production, magnesium production, shipbuilding, and synthetic rubber in military factories could be removed from the war preparedness factories. 2. It believed that Japan's industrial level could "develop freely under the condition of not engaging in military industries." In fact, it was precisely the military industries that could "develop freely" because the developing crude steel and ordinary steel were all part of the military industry. 3. It suggested that the United States provide Japan with loans and that Asian countries resume trade with Japan, with China supplying Japan with various raw materials. This was a pyramid-shaped rule of "Capital America, Industrial Japan, Agricultural China." 4. It believed that war spoils already in the hands of the Soviet Union and China should be counted as formal reparations. This Draper plan was designed to prevent Japan from making reparations in every possible way, to maintain Japan's military industry. The Draper Plan also stipulated that MacArthur could execute the reparations plan with full authority. In this way, the Far Eastern Commission and the Council of Foreign Ministers preparing the peace treaty were disregarded, and the demands for reparations from Japan by other countries that had suffered from Japanese aggression and contributed to the war against Japan, especially China, were wiped out by the US government single-handedly.

　　Recently, the US government has even openly announced the cancellation of the "temporary reparations plan" it had drafted, attempting to completely cancel all reparations in order to step up the restoration of Japan's war industry, more nakedly exposing the ambitions of US imperialism.

　　The facts are already clear: the position taken by the US government on the issue of Japanese reparations is to cancel Japan's reparations, preserve Japanese financial groups, preserve and restore Japan's military industry, help Japan's aggressive forces revive, and turn Japan into its arsenal and base of aggression in the Far East. This domineering behavior of US imperialists completely violates the Potsdam Declaration regarding Japan and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission, seriously damaging the interests of the countries that fought against Japan in the Far East, especially the Chinese people. This reactionary measure of the US government to support Japanese aggressive forces threatens peace in the Far East and the world, stifles the recovery of Japan's peaceful industry and the realization of Japan's democratization, and is equally detrimental to the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this evil act of US imperialism and solemnly declare that any US reparations plan and measures that violate the Potsdam Declaration are illegal. The Chinese people have the right to demand reparations from Japan and will never allow the US government to unilaterally cancel Japanese reparations.

　　美国取消日本赔偿
    陈翰伯
    一九四五年七月二十六日颁布的波茨坦对日公告规定：“日本将被准许保持为维持其经济所需要及可以偿付实物赔偿的工业，但可以使日本重新武装作战的工业，不在其内”。一九四七年六月二十日远东委员会发表的对日基本政策确定：“只有维持日本民主经济及支付赔偿物品的工业，才准其发展，而使日本能重整军备的工业，则绝对不许存在”。一九四七年八月十四日，远东委员会通过减少日本军事工业潜力的决议，具体规定了日本赔偿问题的如下原则：“一切基本和次要的战争工业，都应划作赔偿”。
    这些公告、政策、决议写得明明白白，这就是日本必须履行赔偿，日本的一切战争工业必须拆毁移作赔偿品。但是，美国将近四年来在日本赔偿问题上的所作所为，完全和上述原则背道而驰。
    美国关于日本赔偿问题的第一个计划，是鲍莱计划。一九四五年十一月，鲍莱率领的代表团到达日本，他根据日本外务省和商工省各自拟好的方案，发表了一个计划。主要的内容是把日本工业分为三类，一、军需工业，如制铝、制锰、人造橡胶等等，全部拆除，充作赔偿；二、重要工业，如电力、造船、钢铁、制钢、炼钢、机械工具制造、交通器材等等，部分拆除，拨作赔偿；三、基本工业，如纺织、生丝、制革、水泥、营造材料、锯木、陶器、煤矿、金银矿、柴油矿、粗橡胶制造、轻电器材料、以及锌铝锡硫化矿的提炼厂等等，全部保留，不作赔偿。这一计划不仅过于宽大，而且还在重要工业项目的掩盖下部分地保存了日本的战争工业。例如计划规定日本每年可生产钢铁二百五十万吨，保存船舶一百五十万吨，并允许每年可造新船十五万吨，修理三百万吨。接着，麦克阿瑟总部于一九四六年八月，按照远东委员会通过的临时赔偿品拆迁方案，指定一千另九十个工厂充作赔偿。一九四七年四月，美国政府又片面命令麦克阿瑟把上项指定的工厂的百分之三十，先拨给中（当时的国民党政府）、菲、荷、英四国。这就是所谓“临时赔偿计划”。但不久，麦克阿瑟就把自己指定的充作赔偿的一千另九十个工厂，削减为九百三十四个。原来规定要拆迁的飞机工厂是四百四十七个，被削减为三百三十四个。被消减去的有地下飞机厂二十四个。原来规定要拆迁的私营军火工厂是二百七十三个，后来削减为二百三十五个。一九四八年初，又被削减成八百四十五个，其中有被削减掉的中岛飞机厂四十五个，畑野重坦克厂二十个。同时，麦克阿瑟又批准八百四十五个工厂中的五百个，由日人经营，原地开工，这等于也被削减掉了。充作赔偿的工厂数目的一再削减，所谓“临时赔偿计划”所规定的数目当然亦随之减少。实际上，到现在为止，已被拆迁充作赔偿的工厂仅有十八座。
    一九四七年，美国陆军部帮办、麦克鲁公司总裁斯揣克等一行三次到达日本。他们的调查目标，已经扩展为调查日本的工业潜能、日本经济复兴所需要的工业设备、以及日本可能作为战争赔偿品的工业资产了。斯揣克发表了一篇“报复即浪费”的反赔偿，认为赔偿妨碍日本经济复兴，建议放弃赔偿。一九四八年二月，美国陆军部公布日本工业赔偿估计报告书（即通常所称的斯揣克计划）规定赔偿额为四亿一千二百零四万美元。这比鲍莱计划规定的赔偿额，减少了百分之七十。该计划并规定“除主要的战争工业外，不要把日本的生产设备移去”，所谓“主要的战争工业”可以移去，实际是一大谎话，铝、镁、石油、若干化学工业还是被麦克阿瑟保留了。而次要的战争工业则被公开地保存了。
    到了德莱柏计划，就比以上各次计划更进了一步，中心内容变成企图以取消赔偿来完全保存和恢复日本的军事工业了。德莱柏是前美国陆军部的次长，他率领了一批和美国独占资本有关的人物，到日本进行调查，在一九四八年五月公布了报告书（这份报告书是由该团团员前化学银行董事长强斯敦起草的，所以又称强斯敦计划）。主张日本的赔偿额为一亿六千五百余万美元，其要点有：一、麦克阿瑟总部可以自由处置有关日本军事工业的赔偿，并且可以以其他同等生产量，来代替列入赔偿项目的军事工业，而且又明文规定军事工业的硝酸、制铝、制镁、造船、人造橡胶，可以从战备工厂中取消。二、认为日本的工业水准可以“听其在不从事军事工业的条件下，自由发展”。事实上，可以“自由发展”的，却正是军事工业。因为可以发展的粗钢、普通钢铁，都是属于军事工业的。三、建议美国给予日本贷款，亚洲各国恢复对日贸易由中国供给日本各种原料。这就是“资本美国、工业日本、农业中国”一座金字塔式的统治。四、认为已经入于苏联和中国手中的战利品，都应该算作是正式赔偿。德莱柏的这种计划，就是千方百计地使日本不作赔偿，以保持日本的军事工业。德莱柏计划并规定可由麦克阿瑟全权执行赔偿计划。这样，远东委员会以及准备和约的外长会议，都被弃置不顾了，其他曾经遭受日寇祸害并对对日抗战有过贡献的国家，特别是中国，对于日本的赔偿要求，就都被美国政府一手抹煞了。
    最近，美国政府更公开宣布取消由它们拟定的“临时赔偿计划”，企图根本取消一切赔偿，以加紧恢复日本战争工业，更赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义的野心。
    事实已经清清楚楚，美国政府在日本赔偿问题上所采取的立场，是取消日本的赔偿，保存日本财阀，保存和恢复日本军事工业，帮助日本侵略势力复活，把日本变成它在远东的兵工厂和侵略基地。美帝国主义者这种专横行为，完全违反了波茨坦对日公告及远东委员会的历次决议的，严重的损害远东对日作战各国，首先是中国人民的利益。美国政府这种扶植日本侵略势力的反动措施，威胁着远东和世界和平，窒息日本和平工业的恢复和日本民主化的实现，对于日本工人阶级和广大人民同样也是不利的。中国人民坚决地反对美国帝国主义这一罪恶行为，并郑重地宣布违背波茨坦公告的任何美国的赔偿计划和措施，一概是非法的。中国人民有权要求日本赔偿，决不允许美国政府片面的取消日本赔偿。
