　　Resolutely Suppress Speculation and Maintain Price Stability!
　　Since the price fluctuations in the Tianjin and Beijing areas in late April, the prices of various goods generally remained relatively stable in May and June after the strong efforts of our state-owned trading agencies to stabilize them. However, since the beginning of July, prices in Tianjin and Beijing have again fluctuated for the past twenty or so days, and the rate of increase has been far greater than in the past, with the average price of various goods increasing by about one and a half times. Taking Tianjin as an example, comparing July 24th with June 30th, the price of rice increased by 117 percent, millet and flour both increased by two times, corn increased by 110 percent, cotton yarn increased by 141 percent, Wufu cloth increased by 105 percent, cotton increased by 98 percent, and cooking oil increased by 140 percent. In addition, the prices of Western medicines, electrical materials, and other goods also increased sharply. The rate of price increases in Beijing is roughly equal to that in Tianjin.
　　The main reasons for this price fluctuation in Tianjin and Beijing are as follows:
　　First, it was affected by the price increases in Shanghai. Since the liberation of Shanghai, the prices of various goods have generally been higher than in Tianjin and Beijing. Due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' implementation of a policy of malignant inflation and indiscriminate issuance of paper money, the people in the vast areas of Jiangnan automatically refused to use the pseudo "Gold Yuan Certificates" and switched to using silver dollars as a medium of exchange before our People's Liberation Army marched into Jiangnan on a large scale. Silver dollar speculators took the opportunity to stir up trouble, raising prices and disrupting the market. When our army liberated Shanghai and the vast areas of Jiangnan, the biggest economic difficulty we encountered was how to promptly eliminate silver dollar speculation so that our Renminbi could quickly occupy urban and rural markets, stabilize prices, stabilize people's lives, and ensure the rapid restoration of social and economic order. Over the past few months, through various effective measures taken by our local people's governments and the active assistance of people from all walks of life, the speculative activities of silver dollars have been basically eliminated in major and medium-sized cities in Jiangnan. However, in the vast rural areas, because our various tasks are still in their initial stages and state-owned trade, banking, and other economic institutions have only just begun to be established, silver dollars are still circulating in the market. This has caused our Renminbi to concentrate in major cities, making it difficult to exchange goods between urban and rural areas, and temporarily showing a phenomenon of currency concentration and material shortage in major and medium-sized cities such as Shanghai. In addition, continuous summer rains in the vast areas of Jiangnan in recent months have blocked transportation, greatly reducing the amount of grain and other materials transported from various places to Beijing and Shanghai. Coupled with the Kuomintang reactionaries' blockade of ports such as Shanghai, our foreign trade has also been temporarily stagnant.
　　Based on the above situation, Shanghai's prices have continued to rise again since late June. After the direct train service between Beijing and Shanghai began in early July, Shanghai speculators brought large amounts of cash to Tianjin and Beijing to purchase large quantities of goods. At first, they mainly privately purchased gold and silver for smuggling south, and later they generally hoarded various imported goods, yarn, cloth, grain, and so on. As a result, this has also created the trend of rising prices in Tianjin and Beijing led by Shanghai in recent months.
　　Secondly, the speculative capital in Tianjin and Beijing markets engaging in speculation and disruption is also one of the main reasons for the price fluctuations in Tianjin and Beijing this time. According to reports, not only has private floating capital been very active in the Tianjin and Beijing markets in recent months, but also some of our public-owned stores, agency production, and cooperatives have followed the trend, competing to speculate and hoard, resulting in the fact that prices in Tianjin and Beijing in recent days have not only greatly exceeded those in inland cities in North China (the price of millet in Tianjin on July 23rd was about twice as high as in Shijiazhuang on the same day), but also higher than in Shanghai.
　　Again, the recent heavy rains in various parts of North China have blocked transportation; coupled with the fact that the majority of farmers are afraid of water disasters and reduced autumn harvests, they are unwilling to continue selling the agricultural products they have in hand, which has also played a certain stimulating role in the price increases in Tianjin and Beijing this time.
　　The above points are the main reasons for the price fluctuations in Tianjin and Beijing this time. So, what measures should we take to stabilize current prices?
　　First, we must severely crack down on speculative activities in the market; in particular, we should first punish the speculative activities of certain public-owned stores. Public-owned stores have the responsibility to assist the government in stabilizing prices, and agency production is not allowed to engage in buying and selling, and is not allowed to engage in speculation. Our people's government has long issued clear orders. However, until now, some units have still failed to earnestly implement them. In this price fluctuation in Tianjin and Beijing, some public-owned stores, agency production, and cooperatives have not only failed to vigorously assist our state-owned trade agencies in selling goods to stabilize prices, but on the contrary, they only cared about the interests of their small groups and a few individuals and secretly colluded with private speculators in the market, disregarding the interests of the country and the people,抢购物资违法囤积,操纵物价. This kind of unorganized and undisciplined bad behavior cannot be tolerated by the laws and disciplines of our people's democratic government. Ideologically, it is purely a decadent and hateful capitalist speculative ideology. It is hoped that the government will conduct a prompt inspection and strictly stop various speculative activities of public and private businesses.
　　Second, the leadership agencies in Shanghai have recently been vigorously stabilizing prices and have achieved results. The broad masses of the people in North China must take care of the overall interests and actively support Shanghai's work in stabilizing prices, and help the people of Shanghai and Jiangnan to overcome this temporary difficulty. Recalling the initial liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, there were also continuous price fluctuations. At that time, not only the people in various parts of North China, but also the people in the liberated areas of East China, Central China, Northeast China, and Northwest China used a large amount of materials to support Tianjin and Beijing, so that prices in Tianjin and Beijing could be restored to stability. Today, Shanghai is in a situation similar to that of Tianjin and Beijing in the early days of liberation. We, the people of North China, should also vigorously support Shanghai and the newly liberated areas of Jiangnan, so that Shanghai's prices can also be restored and maintained stably. Shanghai is the largest economic center in the country. If Shanghai's prices are not stable, it will be difficult for prices in North China and Tianjin and Beijing to remain stable independently. Therefore, actively adjusting materials to support Shanghai is actually the most effective way to maintain price stability in Tianjin and Beijing.
　　Third, in this price stabilization work, our state-owned trade agencies must not only severely crack down on speculative activities, but also adjust a large amount of materials at the same time, and use economic power to restore price stability in Tianjin and Beijing. For the floating capital that is pouring into Tianjin and Beijing from Shanghai, we should generally not restrict them if they purchase materials and transport them back to Shanghai, but if they engage in speculative hoarding, they should also be punished accordingly. At the same time, we should also strive to take the initiative and automatically transport a large amount of materials to supply the markets in Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places. We have recently shipped a large amount of coal and salt to supply major cities along the Yangtze River. This is the most effective measure to actively regulate prices in various places and maintain market stability, and should continue to be carried out in the future.

### 严厉取缔投机活动保持物价平稳！

　　严厉取缔投机活动保持物价平稳！
    平津两地物价，自四月下旬发生的一次波动，经我国营贸易机关大力平抑后，五六两月份，各货价格一般是处于相当稳定的状态。但入七月以来，近二十余天的平津物价，又趋波动，而且上涨速度远较过去为甚，各货价格平均上涨了一倍半左右。以天津为例，七月二十四日与六月三十日比较，大米上涨了百分之一百一十七，小米与面粉皆上涨了两倍，玉米上涨了百分之一百一十，棉纱上涨了百分之一百四十一，五福布上涨了百分之一百零五，棉花上涨了百分之九十八，食油上涨了百分之一百四十，此外西药、电料等价格，上涨亦猛。北平各货价格上涨的比率，亦大致与天津相等。
    构成此次平津物价波动的主要原因有下列几点：
    首先是受上海物价上涨的影响。上海自解放以来，各货价格一般皆高于平津。由于国民党反动派实施恶性通货膨胀政策，滥发纸币，因此在我人民解放军大举进军江南以前，江南广大地区人民即自动拒用伪“金元券”，改用银元作交换的媒介。银元投机商人乘机兴风作浪，哄抬物价，扰乱市场。当我军解放上海及江南广大地区时，在经济上所遇到的最大困难，是如何及时肃清银元投机，使我人民币得以很快占领城乡市场，以平稳物价，安定人民生活，保证社会经济秩序的迅速恢复。几月来经过我当地人民政府的各种有力措施，及各阶层人民的积极协助，在江南各大中城市中，目前已基本上肃清了银元的投机活动。但在广大的农村中，则由于我各种工作尚在初创，国营贸易、银行等经济机构，才开始建立，因之银元仍在市场上流通。遂使我人民币，集中流通于各主要城市，城乡物资交流困难，使上海等大中城市，暂时表现了通货集中和物资缺乏的现象。此外，近月来江南广大地区夏雨连绵，交通被阻，各地运往京沪的粮食等类物资大为减少，加以国民党反动派，对上海等港口的封锁，使我对外贸易亦一时处于停滞状态。
    基于上述情况，上海物价自六月下旬起复继续上涨。七月初平沪直达通车开始后，上海投机商人即大批携带现钞，来平津大量采购物资。开始主要是私购金银走私南运，其后即普遍囤积各种进口品及纱、布、粮食等。因之，也就造成了近月来平津物价由上海带头上涨的趋势。
    其次，平津两市之投机资本，在市场上的投机倒把，兴风作浪，亦为此次平津物价波动的主要原因之一。据报近月来平津两市市场上，不但私人游资大为活跃，而且我某些公营商店、机关生产及合作社，亦随波逐浪，竞作投机囤积，致形成最近几天平津物价，不但大大超过于华北内地各城市（天津七月二十三日小米价格与石家庄同日比较约高一倍），而且高于上海。
    再次，最近华北各地雨水较大，交通受阻；加以广大农民怕受水灾秋收减产，因之不愿继续出卖手中所存的农产品，亦对此次平津物价上涨，起着一定的刺激作用。
    以上各点，即为此次平津物价波动的主要原因。那么，对稳定当前物价，我们应当采取哪些措施呢？
    第一、必须严厉取缔市场上的投机活动；尤应首先惩罚某些公营商店的投机活动。公营商店有协助政府平稳物价的责任，机关生产不准作买卖，不准投机倒把，我人民政府早有明令规定。但直到现在为止，有些单位仍未能认真贯彻执行，在此次平津物价波动中，部分公营商店，机关生产及合作社，不但不大力协助我国营贸易机关抛售物资平抑物价，相反的只顾其小集团少数私人的利益在市场上与投机私商暗相勾结，不顾国家和人民的利益，抢购物资违法囤积，操纵物价。此种无组织、无纪律的恶劣行为，是我人民民主政府的法纪所不能容许的。从思想上讲，纯粹是一种腐朽的可恶的资本主义投机思想。希望政府迅速进行检查，严厉制止公私商号的各种投机活动。
    第二、上海的领导机关，最近已在大力平抑物价，并已收到成效。对上海平抑物价的工作，我华北广大人民必须照顾整体利益，积极支援，帮助上海及江南人民来克服这种暂时的困难。回忆平津初解放时，同样也曾发生过连续的物价波动。那时不但华北各地人民，且连华东、华中、东北与西北各解放区人民，均曾用大量物资来支援平津，使平津的物价得以恢复平稳。今天上海所处情况，正如平津初解放时。我们华北人民，也应当用大力来支援上海及江南新解放区，使上海的物价亦能恢复并保持平稳。上海是全国最大的经济中心，如果上海的物价不平稳，我华北及平津的物价断难单独保持平稳。所以主动调剂物资支援上海，实际上也就是保持平津物价平稳的最有效的办法。
    第三、我国营贸易机关，在此次稳定物价工作中，除严厉打击投机活动外，必须同时大量调剂物资，用经济的力量来恢复平津物价的平稳。对于上海涌来平津的游资，如果他们采购物资运回上海，我们一般不应限制，但如进行投机囤积，则应同样予以惩处。同时且应争取主动，自动运送大量物资去供应上海、武汉各地市场。我们最近已运出了大量的煤炭和食盐等，去供应长江沿岸各大城市，这是主动调节各地物价，保持市场安定的最有效的措施，今后仍应继续进行。
