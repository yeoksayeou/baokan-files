　　Red Flags in the Rain on July 1st
    Yu Pingbo
    A sultry summer,
    A dusk with a weather forecast of "scattered showers,"
    The plaza just inside Yongding Gate, leaning west,
    Everyone celebrates the 28th birthday of the Chinese Communist Party.
　
    Here, it is filled with colors of gratitude,
    Vibrating with harmonious and majestic songs,
    Large red flags, circular emblems,
    Sparkling silver lights, intermittently illuminating,
    The giant statues of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin,
    Towering in mid-air,
    As if the great mentors were present.
　
    The wind is coming,
    The rain is coming,
    But the wind cannot blow away the sincerely awaiting hearts,
    This rain cannot drench the inspiring enthusiasm,
    The brothers of the troops say, "We are not afraid!"
    Everyone is not afraid,
    We are together in the wind and rain,
    Singing, dancing, shouting,
    The entire plaza is excited, struggling against the merciless wind and rain.
　
    "The situation has turned around!"
    The red flags rustle and flutter loudly.
    The setting sun reflects a beautiful rainbow,
    Dense clouds reveal a sickle-like newborn moon.
    The rain is about to stop,
    But the rain intensifies,
    Dripping and pattering on the brim of hats, water flowing straight down.
    Even carrying a slight red tinge,
    Sprinkling over people's light-colored clothes,
　
    The heavy rain has just passed,
    The conference has just begun,
    Ten thousand voices cheer,
    Ten thousand people like a sea.
　
    The loudspeakers on the rostrum
    Direct this grand and jubilant evening party
    With ease and comfort,
    As if in a room
    Holding a group meeting.
　
    Come and listen to this twenty-eight-year history of struggle!
    Worthy of song and tears.
    How to forge fortitude from hardship and danger,
    How to nurture brightness from suffering,
    We will soon witness with our own eyes
    The birth of this New China of the People.
　
    The electric lights suddenly went out,
    I sat blankly on the high part of the stands,
    The companions beside me were also quietly silent,
    Doubting in the deep mountains, in the vast wilderness,
    Looking up—only the eternally lonely starry sky.
　
    Tomorrow the newspaper will say there were 30,000 people,
    Some will say, "More than that!
    There were 40,000, 50,000!"
    Where have these tens of thousands of people gone at this moment?
    It turns out they are all silent,
    Waiting patiently.
　
    I deeply recognize the solemn order of the masses
    And that high degree of awakening.
    Although silent!
    It is louder than shouting.
    Convinced that the "Great Era" is truly coming soon,
    Taking the first step of the Long March.
    How could we come to such a dreamlike meeting place?
    How could we live in a brand new country?
    This is something that has not happened in a century,
    This is something that has not been experienced in half a century,
    I don't feel like I am still in this ancient Beiping.

　　七月一日红旗的雨
    俞平伯
    一个闷热的夏天，
    气象预报“有阵雨”的黄昏，
    永定门里西偏的广场，
    大家庆贺中国共产党二十八岁的生辰。
　
    这里，充满着感激的颜色，
    振动着和谐雄壮的歌声，
    大幅的红旗，圆圈招＠，
    闪烁的银灯，断续照明，
    马、恩、列、斯的巨像，
    高标半空，
    如伟大的导师们亲临。
　
    风来啦，
    雨来啦，
    但风，吹不动期待的真心，
    这雨浇不湿鼓舞的热情，
    部队的弟兄们说“不怕！”
    大家都不怕呵，
    我们同在风雨之中，
    歌唱，舞蹈，高呼，
    整个儿的广场激动起来跟无情的风雨斗争。
　
    “风云转啦！”
    红旗刮得花喇花喇的直响。
    夕阳反映美丽的长虹，
    浓云透出镰刀似的新生月亮。
    雨快要歇了，
    雨反而急了，
    滴滴搭搭打在帽沿上水往下直淌。
    更捎带着微微的红色，
    洒遍人们浅淡的衣裳，
　
    暴雨才过，
    大会初开，
    万口欢呼，
    万人如海。
　
    主席台上的扩音器
    把这盛大狂欢的晚会
    指挥到轻松如意，
    仿佛在一间屋子里
    开小组会议。
　
    都来听听这二十八年奋斗史罢！
    可歌可泣。
    怎么样从艰危里锻炼出坚贞，
    怎么样从苦难里孕育着光明，
    我们不久将亲眼看到
    这中华人民新国的诞生。
　
    电火骤然灭了，
    我呆坐在看台的高处，
    旁边的伙伴也静悄悄地，
    疑惑在深山里，大野中，
    抬头——惟有永远寂寞的星空。
　
    明儿报上说有三万人，
    有的说，“不止，不止！
    有四万，五万！”
    这一忽儿，这几万人那里去了？
    原来他们都不则声，
    都在耐心等待。
　
    我深深体认到群众的庄严的秩序
    和那高度的觉醒。
    虽是沉默呵！
    比呼喊还要响哩。
    确信“大时代”真快到了，
    迈开了第一步的万里长征。
    怎么会到如梦的会场来呢？
    怎么会生活在全新的国度里呢？
    这是一世纪来所没有的，
    这是半世纪来所没有经识过的，
    我不觉得，我还在这古老的北平。
