  　Comments on Senate Approval of Aggression Pact
    The People Will Never Support It; Warmongers Have Become More Vulnerable Recently!
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 23rd] TASS Washington, July 22nd: Despite widespread public opposition and serious doubts and reservations from many senators, the U.S. Senate approved the North Atlantic Treaty on the 21st. Although the U.S. government has achieved a formal "victory" with the treaty's approval, observers point out that the government has no reason to be pleased by the treaty's passage. According to observers, despite the U.S. government's months of intense propaganda, forcing people to believe that the North Atlantic Treaty is a "defensive" endeavor, it has failed to gain popular support for the treaty. The U.S. government's frenzied efforts at propaganda have been unsuccessful. The broad masses of the American people actively oppose the North Atlantic Treaty, considering it a dangerous military adventure that undermines the foundation of peace. Observers also point out that popular opposition, as well as domestic and international problems caused by the economic difficulties being experienced by the capitalist world, have to some extent shaken the so-called "bipartisan unity" of American foreign policy. The Republican leadership, which once acted in concert with the Truman administration on the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, "aid" to Greece and Turkey, and other issues, is now unable to agree on the issue of the North Atlantic Treaty. For example, on the one hand, Vandenberg and Dulles strongly urged the Senate to approve the treaty, while some influential Republican leaders, such as Taft and Wherry, expressed opposition. Observers finally pointed out that the Senate debate shows that it will not be easy for the government to pass the plan to arm Western Europe. Many senators who voted in favor of the treaty openly admitted during the debate that they had serious doubts and fears, and only voted in favor because the government assured them that approving the treaty would not obligate the United States to arm Western Europe. The struggle surrounding the approval of the North Atlantic Treaty shows that the position of American warmongers has become more vulnerable in recent months, while the ranks of peace fighters are constantly expanding.

　　华盛顿观察家
  　评参院批准侵略公约
    人民永不会支持它，战争贩子最近已更为脆弱了！
    【新华社北平二十三日电】塔斯社华盛顿二十二日讯：美参院不顾人民的普遍反对和许多参议员的严重怀疑和保留态度，于二十一日批准北大西洋公约。虽然美国政府由于公约的批准而获得了形式上的“胜利”，但是，观察家指出：政府并没有因为公约获得通过而感到高兴的根据。据观察家称：尽管美政府许多月来进行了紧张的宣传，迫使人民相信北大西洋公约是什么“防御”事业，但是，它并不能取得人民对于公约的支持。美政府热狂的努力宣传是不成功的。美国广大人民积极反对北大西洋公约，认为它是破坏和平基础的危险军事冒险。观察家并指出：人民大众的反对以及由于资本主义世界正在经历着的经济困难所引起的国内和国际的问题，已经在一定程度上动摇了美国外交政策的所谓“两党联合”。曾经在杜鲁门主义、马歇尔计划、“援助”希土及其他问题上和杜鲁门政府一致行动的共和党领导方面，现在，在北大西洋公约问题上就不能互相一致了，例如，一方面，范登堡和杜勒斯力促参院批准公约，而象塔夫脱和惠利等一些颇有势力的共和党领袖，则表示反对。观察家最后指出：参院的辩论显示，政府要通过武装西欧计划是不容易的。许多投票赞成公约的参议员辩论时公开承认：他们抱着严重的怀疑和恐惧，只是因为政府保证批准公约并不使美国有武装西欧的义务，他们才投赞成票的。围绕着批准北大西洋公约问题而进行的斗争显示，美国战争贩子们的地位最近几个月来已经更为脆弱了，而和平战士的行列则在不断地扩大着。
