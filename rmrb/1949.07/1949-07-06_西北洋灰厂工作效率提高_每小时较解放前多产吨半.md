　　【Taiyuan Telegram】The Northwest Cement Factory in Taiyuan has increased its production efficiency. The enemy-operated finished product grinding machine was started. From the resumption of work in early May to June 10th, excluding power outages and Sunday breaks, it worked for a total of 233 hours, producing 1,237 tons of finished product, averaging 5.16 tons of cement per hour, an increase of 1.46 tons compared to the pre-liberation April hourly output of 3.7 tons. Quarry workers worked a total of 1,868 shifts (10 hours per shift), mining 4,075 tons of limestone, averaging 2.17 tons per shift, an increase of 1.42 tons compared to the pre-liberation March and April output of 1.42 tons per shift (12 hours). The productivity of general workers in the repair department has also greatly improved. For example, in March before liberation, 13 apprentices and 4 technicians in the foundry department cast an average of 107 30 cm iron balls per shift. After liberation (in May), 7 apprentices and 1 technician worked 86 shifts and cast 15,096 30 cm iron balls, averaging 175 per shift, an increase of 60% in production efficiency compared to before liberation. In early June, they worked 58 shifts and created an amazing production record, casting a total of 15,096 30 cm iron balls, averaging 379 per shift, an increase of 2.5 times in production efficiency compared to before liberation.
