Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 30th: In order to adapt to the characteristics of the city, the Jinan Municipal People's Government has begun to change the organizational form and working methods of the municipal government. The Municipal Government has determined that it is the basic organization of the municipal people's government, and all work and policy decision-making powers are concentrated in the unified management of the Municipal Government. All district governments have been changed to district offices, their staffing has been streamlined, and they are staffed with five people: the district head, secretary, clerk, and assistant, serving as the dispatched agencies of the Municipal Government. The regular work of the district offices, in addition to understanding the situation and reflecting the opinions of citizens as a reference for the Municipal Government's decisions and implementation of policies, also handles welfare and other civil affairs matters under the centralized leadership of the Municipal Government, and mediates general civil disputes, such as real estate, debt, marriage, and other matters assigned by the Municipal Government. The work originally carried out by the district governments, such as cleaning and sanitation, issuing loans, organizing cooperatives, and land reporting, are now handled by the relevant departments of the Municipal Government, and the public security sub-bureaus in the district offices assist in the implementation. All street governments and administrative organizations below the street level have been abolished. As for mass organizations such as production committees, they can be guided by the relevant departments according to their nature. However, in districts with rural areas, the general organization remains unchanged, and the rural township governments remain as before. The work of the police stations should be strengthened; the education and transformation of the old police should also be strengthened. Under the direct leadership of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and sub-bureaus, the police stations carry out the following tasks: (1) Household registration administration, social investigation. (2) Eliminating secret agents and other counter-revolutionary elements. (3) Mediating civil disputes among citizens. (4) Arresting bandits and preventing theft and abduction. (5) Performing patrols and maintaining revolutionary order. (6) Upholding government decrees, protecting public buildings, enforcing bans on opium and gambling, and implementing air defense and anti-poison measures. (7) Managing the city appearance, managing sanitation, and assisting in fire prevention. (8) Managing violations of police regulations and cracking down on illegal activities.

　　济南适应城市特点改变政权组织形式
    【新华社济南三十日电】济南市人民政府为适应于城市的特点，着手改变市政权的组织形式与工作方式。市政府已确定为市人民政权的基本组织，一切工作与政策的决定权均集中于市府统一进行。各区政府一律改为区公所，紧缩其编制，设区长、秘书、办事员、助理员等五人，成为市府之派出机关。区公所的经常工作除了解情况，反映市民意见，作为市府决定与推行政策的参考外，并在市府集中领导下，办理优抚及其他民政事项，调解一般的民事纠纷，如房地产、债务、婚姻等及其他市府交办事项。其原由各区政府所进行的工作如清洁卫生、发放贷款、组织合作社、土地陈报等分别由市府各主管部门负责办理，各区公所里各公安分局则协助执行。街政府及街以下各种行政组织一律取消。至于群众性组织如生产委员会等可分别按照性质，归各该主管部门指导。但在有农村的区则一般组织不动，农村乡政府仍然照旧。派出所的工作应予加强；旧警察的教育与改造工作也应加强。派出所在市公安局与分局直接领导下进行以下工作：（一）户籍行政，社会调查。（二）肃清特务及其他反革命分子。（三）调解市民纠纷。（四）缉拿盗匪，防止偷窃拐骗。（五）执行巡逻，维持革命秩序。（六）维护政府法令，保护公共建筑，执行禁烟禁赌，防空防毒。（七）管理市容，管理卫生，协助消防。（八）掌管违警事件，取缔违法活动。
