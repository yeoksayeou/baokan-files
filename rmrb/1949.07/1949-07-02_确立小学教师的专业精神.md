　　Establishing the Professional Spirit of Elementary School Teachers

　　During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the three years of the People's Liberation War, elementary school teachers in our liberated areas worked hard and demonstrated a sense of responsibility and initiative in serving the people. Some, like Lian Dehua, an old teacher in Zuoquan County, Taihang, who dedicated thirty years to education, regarded education as their lifelong career, showing a high degree of professional spirit by being "the same for thirty years." However, due to objective limitations, some difficulties faced by schools and elementary school teachers (such as funding, teachers' living conditions, and political treatment) were not fully resolved appropriately, leading some elementary school teachers to underestimate elementary education, which affected the regularization of school education. To address this, the North China People's Government recently promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Service for Elementary School Teachers in the North China Region." The main spirit of these "Provisional Regulations" is to clearly define the sacred duties, political status, and living conditions of elementary school teachers, enhance their sense of responsibility and initiative in serving the people, and establish a professional spirit. For example, regarding living conditions, there will be more adequate guarantees in the future, allowing teachers to receive salaries for all twelve months of the year. Absences due to personal or medical reasons will not result in salary deductions due to hiring substitutes, and appropriate care will be provided for teachers facing illness, family difficulties, or during female teachers' maternity periods. In terms of political status, teachers can attend village and district government meetings, raising their political standing.

　　Secondly, to bring elementary education into a more regularized state and overcome certain guerrilla-style habits that occurred in the past war environment, improvement measures have also been formulated, such as implementing systems for leave, examination, assessment, tenure, and transfer. In particular, methods such as electing model teachers and recommending them for further studies in normal schools provide elementary school teachers with broad development prospects, breaking the misconception that "being an elementary school teacher has no future."

　　The "Provisional Regulations on Service for Elementary School Teachers in the North China Region" is one of the major achievements of the North China Elementary Education Conference. It has the same importance as the "Provisional Implementation Measures for Elementary Education in the North China Region" and the "Instructions on Several Important Issues Concerning Elementary Education" promulgated not long ago. Governments at all levels, education departments, and the vast number of elementary school teachers should carefully study these three documents, improve education, enhance the professional spirit of elementary school teachers, establish a worldview of serving the people, study hard, and strive for the educational cause of the new China.

　　确立小学教师的专业精神
    抗战八年及人民解放战争的三年中，我解放区的小学教师曾经艰苦奋斗，发挥了为人民服务的责任心与积极性，甚至有不少如太行左权县三十年的老教师连得华者，把教育工作当做自己的终生事业，“三十年如一日”，表现了高度的专业精神。但由于客观条件的限制，学校和小学教员的一些困难（如经费、教员生活、政治待遇等）未能完全得到适当的解决，致使部分小学教员存在着轻视小学教育的观点，影响学校教育的正规化。为此华北人民政府最近又公布了“华北区小学教师服务暂行规程”，这个“暂行规程”最主要的精神是明确的规定了小学教师的神圣职责以及政治的生活的待遇，提高其为人民服务的责任心与积极性，确立专业精神。举如：在生活待遇上，今后更加有了充分保障，可以领到全年十二个月的薪金，因事因病请假也不因请代理人而减薪金，而且本人有了疾病，家庭有了困难，或女教员生育时期，均予以适当照顾。在政治待遇上，则可以列席村区政务会议，提高了政治地位。
    其次为使小学教育步入正规，克服过去战争环境下发生的某些游击习气，也订出改进办法，如实行请假、检定、考核、任期、调动等制度，特别是选举模范、保送入师范深造等办法，均给予小学教师指出广阔的发展前途，打破了有些人认为“当小学教员没前途”的错误说法。
    “华北区小学教师服务暂行规程”是华北小学教育会议重大成果之一，同不久以前颁发的“华北区小学教育暂行实施办法”，和“关于小学教育几个重要问题的指示”，有着同等重要作用，各地政府，教育部门及广大小学教师都应很好地研究这三个文件，改进教育事业，提高小学教师专业精神，确立为人民服务的人生观，好好学习，为新中国的教育事业而努力奋斗。
