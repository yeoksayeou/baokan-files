Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 9th. The entire staff of the Dalian Glass Factory, a Sino-Soviet joint venture under the Far East Electric Power Company, passed a report to Chairman Mao at a celebration of the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party on July 2nd. The report stated that the factory had completed and exceeded its annual production target for this year in six months. The full text of the report is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:

    We are reporting to you with great excitement: We have won a great victory on the production front. At 8:00 AM on July 1st, the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, we victoriously completed the annual production plan for 1949. This plan represents a 36% increase in production compared to 1948, and a 61% increase compared to the Japanese occupation era (exceeding the factory's highest production level in 25 years). We have also reduced costs by 13.6% and increased labor productivity by 70.9%. This has not only developed our factory, but also greatly improved the lives of all employees, because the factory has implemented a "progressive salary system" with "more work, more pay" and a "piece-rate wage" system.

    This achievement is due to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and yourself, the specific leadership of the Lüda District Party Committee, our study and implementation of the Soviet Union's scientific and excellent system and methods for managing industrial production, and the collective revolutionary heroism displayed by all employees, especially the technical staff and veteran technicians who used their brains to improve production organization and technology, making it more rational. This is the fundamental reason why we completed the annual plan ahead of schedule. Today, on the birthday of our Party, on the eve of China's complete liberation, and on the eve of the upcoming Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to establish the People's Republic of China, we express to you:

    We resolutely support the convening of the new Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the rapid establishment of the government of the People's Republic of China; we are determined to support our people's government through industrial production. To this end, in the second half of the year, in addition to shortening the time for repairing the large melting furnace (for melting glass) by 8% as planned, we will complete an excess production of glass plates equivalent to 35% of this year's plan, and continue to reduce costs by 5%.

    Dear Chairman Mao: To show our determination, all 1,077 employees of our factory are writing you a report with our personal signatures, guaranteeing the completion of the task.

    We shout:

    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live our dear Chairman Mao!
    Labor creates the world, long live the working class!

　　大连玻璃工厂全体职工向毛主席报告生产
    由于中共领导和苏联科学管理经验
  　六个月已超过全年生产任务
    【新华社大连九日电】大连市中苏合营的远东电业公司所属玻璃工厂全体职工，在七月二日举行的庆祝中共诞生二十八周年大会上，通过了给毛主席的一份报告书，报告该厂已在六个月中全部完成并超过了今年全年的生产任务。该报告书全文如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们以万分兴奋的心情，向您报告：我们在生产战线上打了一次大胜仗。我们在中国共产党诞生二十八周年纪念日——七月一日上午八时，胜利完成了一九四九年全年生产计划，这个计划比一九四八年的生产提高百分之三十六，比日寇时代提高百分之六十一（即超过了该厂二十五年来的最高生产水平），并减低成本百分之十三点六，提高劳动生产率百分之七十点九。这不仅发展了我们的工厂，同时也因为厂部实行“多劳多酬”的“累进奖薪制”与“计件工资”制，使全体职工的生活大为改善。
    这一成绩之获得，是由于中国共产党及您的英明领导，旅大区党委的具体领导，我们学习并实施了苏联管理工业生产的科学的优良的制度与办法，全体职工发挥了集体的革命英雄主义，尤其是技术干部与老技术工人开动脑筋，改进了生产组织与技术，使之更合理化。这就是我们提前完成全年计划的基本原因。今天，正值我们党的生日，正值中国即将获得全部解放，正值即将召开新政协成立中华人民民主共和国之际，我们向您表示：
    我们坚决拥护以中国共产党为领导的新政协的召开，并迅速成立中华人民民主共和国政府；我们决在工业生产上来支持我们的人民政府。为此，我们在下半年除了按计划缩短百分之八的修筑溶大窑（化玻璃用）的时间外，要完成相等于本年计划百分之三十五的玻璃板的超额生产，并继续减低成本百分之五。
    亲爱的毛主席：为了表示我们的决心，我们全厂一千零七十七名职工，给您写一个亲笔签名的报告书，保证完成任务。
    我们高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    亲爱的毛主席万岁！
    劳动创造世界，工人阶级万岁！
