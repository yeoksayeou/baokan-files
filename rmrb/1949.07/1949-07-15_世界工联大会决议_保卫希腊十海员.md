　　World Federation of Trade Unions Resolution
  　Defend Ten Greek Seamen
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th] TASS, Milan: The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions passed a resolution on defending the ten leading workers of the Greek Seamen's Union. The resolution stated: The ten seamen sentenced to death by the Greek royalist-fascist government are the loyal sons of the working class and active fighters in the resistance movement during the occupation of Greece by the Hitler bandit gang. After the liberation of Greece, they fought for the democratic reconstruction of the country and for improving the living standards of the working people. In 1948, the royalist-fascist government in Athens sentenced them to death for their self-sacrificing service to the people. This extremely vicious verdict has not been carried out due to the intervention of democratic mass organizations and the United Nations General Assembly. However, the Greek royalist-fascists are eager to kill the ten seamen who are now imprisoned. The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, representing 71.5 million working people united in the World Federation of Trade Unions, protests against the death sentences imposed on the ten Greek seamen and demands the immediate release of these innocent victims of royalist-fascist terror. The Congress instructs the General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions to take appropriate steps, in the spirit of this resolution, towards the United Nations and the governments of Greece, Britain, and the United States.

　　世界工联大会决议
  　保卫希腊十海员
    【新华社北平十四日电】塔斯社米兰讯：世界工联第二届代表大会通过关于保卫希腊海员同盟十名首要工作者的决议。决议中称：被希腊保皇法西斯政府判处死刑的十名海员，是工人阶级的忠诚的儿子，是在希特勒匪帮占领希腊时的抵抗运动中的积极战士。在希腊解放之后，他们为该国的民主重建与为提高劳动人民的生活水平而斗争。一九四八年，雅典保皇法西斯政府因为他们对人民的自我牺牲的服务而将其判处死刑。这种极恶毒的判决，由于民主的民众团体和联合国大会的干涉，才未能付诸实行。然而，希腊保皇法西斯是热望去杀害现在被囚禁在监狱中的那十位海员的。世界工联第二届代表大会代表七千一百五十万团结在世界工联的劳动人民，抗议对十名希腊海员所判处的死刑，并要求毫无稽延的释放这些保皇法西斯恐怖的无辜的受难者。大会训令世界工联总书记按照本决议的精神，对联合国以及希腊、英国和美国的政府，采取适当的步骤。
