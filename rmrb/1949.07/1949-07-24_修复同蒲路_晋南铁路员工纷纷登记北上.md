　　Repairing the Tongpu Railway
  　Railway Workers in Southern Shanxi Register to Go North En Masse
    [Taiyuan Electric Dispatch] Railway workers in Linfen, Yuncheng and other areas of the Taiyuan region are responding to the Taiyuan Railway Bureau's call to repair the Tongpu Railway, and are registering en masse to go north to resume work. Under the leadership of the Linfen City Federation of Trade Unions, a preparatory committee for the Linfen section of the Tongpu Railway was established to lead the railway repair preparations, register railway workers, and mobilize workers to resume work. According to statistics from mid-July, more than 400 workers have registered; in addition to the 278 who have already gone north in batches, the rest are also preparing to depart. To enable employees from various places to quickly get in touch, thirteen liaison stations have been set up between Lingshi Nanguan and Quwo Houma.
