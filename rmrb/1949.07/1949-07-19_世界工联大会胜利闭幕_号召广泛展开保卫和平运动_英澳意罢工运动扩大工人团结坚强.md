The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions has victoriously concluded. This was a congress of great solidarity for the working class of the world. The congress passed resolutions regarding the general report of the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, regarding the defense of peace, the democratic rights of people in all countries, and international trade union solidarity, regarding the defense of the economic and social interests of working people, regarding the report on the establishment of international industrial trade departments, and regarding the activities of trade unions in Asian, Australian, African, and Latin American colonial and semi-colonial countries and the struggle of workers for national independence. The congress also issued a declaration calling on all manual and mental laborers of the world to unite and broadly expand activities to defend peace. On the one hand, the congress relentlessly exposed and attacked right-wing trade union leaders in countries such as the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands. On the other hand, it made the greatest effort to strive for solidarity with the working class in those countries. The congress specifically issued an open letter to workers in the United States, Britain, and other countries, calling on them to return to the big family of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The congress, when electing leading bodies, specifically reserved vice-chair positions for the true representatives of workers in the United States and Britain. It is worth mentioning that although the Chinese delegation was unable to attend the congress due to obstruction by the reactionary Italian government, the report of Liu Ningyi, the head of the Chinese delegation, which was read at the congress, received enthusiastic and resounding applause. This is a clear testament to the militant unity of the working class worldwide.

The strike movements that have recently occurred in Britain, Australia, and Italy are a manifestation of the deepening internal contradictions in those countries. Britain has recently experienced a series of labor disputes and large-scale strikes, the most notable of which is the strike by London dockworkers. Due to the employer and the British government adopting insane repressive measures—declaring a state of "emergency"—the port of London has experienced an unprecedented strike of 14,000 dockworkers, with the potential to spread throughout Britain. The London dockworkers' strike has won the sympathy and support of workers throughout Britain and French dockworkers. The large-scale strike launched by 24,000 coal miners across Australia to demand increased wages has now entered its third week. Due to the heroic persistence of the coal miners and the broad support of workers in all industries across the country, all attempts by the Australian government to break the strike have failed. As a result of the coal miners' strike, Australian industry and transportation have been brought to a standstill, with 600,000 workers ceasing work. The Chifley government is facing this situation with nowhere to turn. The intensification of class struggle in Britain and Australia proves that the determination of workers in both countries to fight for their own rights and interests is increasing, and their internal unity is becoming stronger. More and more workers have begun to recognize the true face of the Labour governments in both countries serving the ruling class. In the past week, 500,000 textile workers and 700,000 steelworkers in Italy have successively held 24-hour general strikes to demand improved living conditions. The steelworkers' strike has been completely victorious. Construction workers throughout Italy have also held a million-person strike to protest the employers' refusal to renegotiate collective contracts and increase wages. This strike is currently continuing to expand.

The movement against the North Atlantic Treaty and to defend peace continues to unfold in various countries. Under the call of the French Communist Party and the direct organization of various democratic groups in France, hundreds of thousands of people in Paris held a grand demonstration on French National Day (July 14th), expressing their will to oppose the North Atlantic Treaty, defend peace, and demand friendship with the Soviet Union. The French people's movement to protest the North Atlantic Treaty is intensifying as the date for the French National Assembly to discuss and ratify the treaty draws nearer. Working people, republicans, and democrats across the country are gathering, or signing petitions, to demand that the representatives of their constituencies vote against the treaty in the National Assembly. In Italy, eight thousand youth representatives from all over the country held a conference in Rome to fight for freedom and peace. On July 10th, Rome also held a 50,000-person anti-war demonstration. Delegation from various regions, carrying petitions with the signatures of millions of people, are arriving in Rome to ask the parliament to reject the North Atlantic Treaty. The Preparatory Committee of the Soviet Peace Congress has been officially formed and has decided to hold the Soviet Peace Congress in Moscow from August 25th to 27th. The Czechoslovak Standing Committee for the Defense of Peace has also been declared established in Prague. At the end of last month, the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Students passed a resolution on the tasks of students in the struggle to defend peace at a meeting held in Bologna, Italy, urging students around the world to fight for peace.

    世界工联大会胜利闭幕
    号召广泛展开保卫和平运动
    英澳意罢工运动扩大工人团结坚强
    世界职工联盟第二届代表大会已经胜利闭幕。这是全世界工人阶级大团结的一次大会。大会通过了关于世界工联活动总报告的决议，关于保卫和平、各国人民的民主权利与国际职工会团结的决议，关于保卫劳动人民经济与社会利益的决议，关于成立国际各业职工部报告的决议，以及关于亚洲、澳洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各殖民地与半殖民地国家职工会活动与工人争取民族独立的决议。大会并发出宣言，号召全世界的体力与脑力劳动者团结一致，广泛展开保卫和平的活动。大会一方面对美英荷等国的右翼职工会领袖进行了无情的揭露和打击，一方面却尽最大的努力，争取与各该国工人阶级的团结。大会特别发出告美英等国工人书，号召他们回到世界工联的大家庭中来。大会在选举领导机关时，并特别为美英两国工人的真正代表保留了副主席的席位。值得提起的是：中国代表团虽因意大利反动政府的阻扰，未能出席大会，但是，在大会上宣读的中国代表团团长刘宁一的报告，却得到热诚与响亮的欢呼，这是全世界工人阶级战斗性的团结一致的显著明证。
    最近时期在英国、澳大利亚与意大利发生的罢工运动，是各该国内部矛盾深刻化的表现。英国在最近发生一连串的劳资纠纷和大规模罢工，其中最引人注意的是伦敦码头工人的罢工。由于雇主与英国政府采取疯狂的高压手段——宣布“紧急状态”的存在，伦敦港口已发生历史上空前的一万四千码头工人的大罢工，并有扩展全英之势。伦敦码头工人的罢工，已赢得英国各地工人与法国码头工人的同情支援。澳大利亚全国二万四千煤矿工人为要求增加工资而发动的大罢工，现已进入第三周。由于煤矿工人的英勇坚持与全国各业工人的广泛支援，澳政府一切击破罢工的企图均已失败。煤矿罢工的结果，使全澳的工业与运输陷于停顿，六十万工人已停止工作，齐佛莱政府正面对着这种情况一筹莫展。英国与澳大利亚阶级斗争的尖锐化，证明了两国工人为保卫自身权益而斗争的决心日益高涨，其内部的团结日益坚强。越来越多的工人，已开始认清了两国工党政府为统治阶级服务的真面目。过去一周，意大利的五十万纺织工人与七十万钢铁工人曾先后举行了二十四小时的总罢工，要求改善生活，钢铁工人的罢工已获完全胜利，全意建筑工人亦举行了百万人的大罢工，以抗议雇主拒绝重订集体合同与增加工资的要求，这一罢工现正继续扩大中。
    反对北大西洋公约与保卫和平的运动继续在各国展开。在法共的号召下，在法国各民主团体的直接组织下，巴黎数十万人民在法国国庆日（七月十四日）举行了盛大的示威游行，表示了反对北大西洋公约、保卫和平、要求对苏友好的意志。法国人民抗议北大西洋公约的运动，正随法国国民议会讨论批准该公约日期的日益迫近而愈趋高涨。全国各地的劳动人民与共和分子、民主分子，正纷纷集会，或签名请愿，要求本选区的议员在国会中否决这一公约。在意大利，全国各地的八千青年代表在罗马举行了争取自由与和平大会。七月十日，罗马又举行了五万人的反战大示威。要求议会否决北大西洋公约的各地请愿代表团，正携带千千万万人民的签名书，纷纷到达罗马。苏联拥护和平大会筹备委员会，已正式组成，该会决定于八月二十五至二十七日在莫斯科举行苏联拥护和平大会。捷克斯洛伐克保卫和平常设委员会亦已在布拉格宣告成立。世界学联执行委员会于上月底在意大利波伦亚举行的会议上，通过了关于学生在保卫和平斗争中的任务的决议，敦促全世界学生为保卫和平而斗争。
