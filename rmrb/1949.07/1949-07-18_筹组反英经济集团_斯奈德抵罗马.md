    Organizing Anti-British Economic Bloc
    Snyder Arrives in Rome
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 17th] Reports from various sources: After conducting economic negotiations with Belgian authorities in Brussels, U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder arrived in Rome on the 15th and "began discussions with Italian government officials on the issue of re-establishing the exchange rate between the lira, the dollar, and the pound sterling" (Reuters). All Rome newspapers believe that Snyder's arrival in Rome is related to "the conflict between the dollar and the pound sterling" and the United States' demand for Italy to reduce tariffs. The Italian Communist Party's newspaper, L'Unità, stated: "Snyder's trip to Europe stems from the U.S. government's attempt to completely crush the pound sterling's resistance to pressure from the dollar." The newspaper claimed that because Italy, like Belgium, is one of London's largest creditors, Snyder is likely trying to exploit this situation to organize an anti-British economic bloc.

    筹组反英经济集团
    斯奈德抵罗马
    【新华社北平十七日电】各方报道：美财长斯奈德在布鲁塞尔与比利时当局进行经济谈判之后，已于十五日抵达罗马，并已于当天与意大利政府官员“开始讨论里拉、美元和英镑重订比值的问题”（路透社）。所有罗马报纸都认为，斯奈德的抵达罗马，与“美元英镑的冲突”以及美国要求意大利减低关税有关。意共机关报团结报说：“斯奈德的欧洲之行，是出于美政府企图完全粉碎英镑对美元压力的抵抗。”该报称：因为意大利亦如比利时一样，是伦敦的最大债主之一。所以，斯奈德很可能试图利用这一局势组织一个反英的经济集团。
