Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: TASS, Milan—The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which opened here on June 29th, victoriously concluded on the evening of July 9th. World Federation of Trade Unions Secretary-General Saillant declared at the closing meeting: The World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee, at its first meeting, elected Vittorio as Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Vice-Chairmen are: Kuznetsov (USSR), Lelièvre (France), Liu Ningyi (China), Toledano (Latin America), Brożek (Netherlands), Dange (India), Pina (Cuba), Diallo Abdoulaye (Africa), Zupka (Czechoslovakia). The two remaining Vice-Chairman positions, intended for representatives from the United States and the United Kingdom, were reserved. When the election of Vittorio, Kuznetsov, Liu Ningyi, Lelièvre, Dange, and others to leadership positions in the World Federation of Trade Unions was announced at the congress, the delegates responded with stormy, prolonged applause. When the representative of the French General Confederation of Labor, Croizat, read out the full text of the World Federation of Trade Unions' resolution on defending peace, defending the democratic rights and economic interests of the working people, and consolidating the unity of the working class, enthusiastic applause erupted again, and the delegates sang the Internationale. The resolution, as well as the World Federation of Trade Unions' letters to American and British workers and trade union members, and to trade union members whose leaders had announced their withdrawal from the World Federation of Trade Unions, were unanimously adopted by the congress. The congress also passed resolutions on Kuznetsov's and Santi's reports on the World Federation of Trade Unions' general policy and struggle for peace, the democratic rights of the people, and international trade union unity; on the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions and national trade union central organizations to defend the economic and social interests of the working people; and on the World Federation of Trade Unions' industrial departments, and on defending the ten Greek sailors—trade union movement leaders sentenced to death by the royalist fascists. Resolutions on other issues were submitted to the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau for final drafting.

In his closing address, World Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Vittorio emphasized that this congress has consolidated the strength of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and consolidated the strength of the international proletariat, who have acquired new and powerful weapons to strengthen the international solidarity of the working people in their struggle for their rights, freedom, democracy, and the maintenance of peace. Vittorio stated: This congress proves that the World Federation of Trade Unions is the only true international organization of the working class capable of achieving the unity of the proletariat of all countries in the world. It proves to the American and British warmongers who lead the imperialist reactionary camp that they are not the masters of the world; the working people of capitalist and colonial countries, united with their liberated brothers in the socialist part of the world, are an invincible force, an indestructible bulwark of peace and progress. When Vittorio called for strengthening the international solidarity of the working people, and strengthening their mighty fortress—the great World Federation of Trade Unions, the delegates responded with stormy applause. All the delegates stood up and sang the Internationale and the Italian proletariat's song—The Red Flag. The meeting hall resounded with thunderous cheers that lasted for a long time.

    【新华社北平十二日电】塔斯社米兰讯：六月二十九日在此间举行的世界工联第二届代表大会，已于七月九日黄昏胜利闭幕。世界工联总书记赛扬在闭幕会上宣称：世界工联执委会在其第一次会议上选出了维特里奥为世界工联主席。副主席为：库兹涅佐夫（苏）、勒里普（法）、刘宁一（中）、托列达诺（拉丁美洲）、布洛兹尔（荷）、丹吉（印）、比纳（古巴）、第阿洛·阿布杜拉（非洲）、朱普卡（捷），另有两个预定要给美国和英国代表的副主席席位，则予以保留。当大会上宣布选举维特里奥、库兹涅佐夫、刘宁一、勒里普、丹吉等人到世界工联的领导职位时，代表们报以暴风雨般的长时间的鼓掌。而当法国总工会代表葛卢阿萨宣读世界工联关于保卫和平、保卫劳动人民民主权利与经济利益、巩固工人阶级团结的决议全文时，会上又响起了热烈的掌声，代表们并高唱国际歌。该决议以及世界工联告美、英两国工人和职工会会员及其他领袖已宣布退出世界工联的职工会会员书，获得大会一致通过。大会并对库兹涅佐夫及杉蒂关于世界工联争取和平、人民的民主权利和国际职工会团结的总政策与斗争的报告、对世界工联及各全国性职工会中央机构保卫劳动人民经济与社会利益的活动，通过了各项决议；而且通过了关于世界工联各业职工部、保卫希腊十名海员——被保皇法西斯判处死刑的职工运动领袖的各项决议。关于其他问题的决议，则提交世界工联执行局最后起草。
    世界工联主席维特里奥在致闭幕辞时，强调声称：本届大会巩固了世界工联的力量，巩固了国际无产阶级的力量，他们已取得新的强有力的武器，这个武器是用以加强劳动人民国际团结，来进行争取他们底权利、自由、民主与维持和平的。维特里奥称：本届大会证明：世界工联是工人阶级的唯一能够实行全世界一切国家无产阶级团结一致的真正国际组织。它向那领导帝国主义反动派阵营的美英战争贩子证明：他们不是世界的主人，资本主义及殖民地国家的劳动人民，与那些世界上社会主义部分中解放了的弟兄团结一起，是不可战胜的力量，是和平与进步的不可摧毁的堡垒。维特里奥号召加强劳动人民的国际团结、加强其强大的堡垒——伟大的世界工联时，代表们报以暴风雨般的鼓掌。全体代表均起立高唱国际歌和意大利无产阶级的歌曲——红旗歌。会议厅响起历时颇久的雷动的欢呼声。
