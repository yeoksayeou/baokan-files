Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 4th: TASS, Milan, June 1st: At the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Congress on June 30th, Solovyov, a member of the Soviet delegation and secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, delivered a speech. After outlining the WFTU's activities in defending world democracy and peace over the past three and a half years, he pointed out that the WFTU has become a militant and authoritative organization, and a serious obstacle to the implementation of sinister plans by imperialist forces. Solovyov then condemned the criminal acts of Jouhaux, Deakin, and Kupers, and other imperialist henchmen who are splitting the world labor movement. He said: The Soviet delegation proposes that the Congress approve the work of the WFTU, which aims to improve the situation of the working class, defend democratic rights and freedoms, and strive for universal and lasting peace. The Congress must condemn the new federation of trade unions that the schismatics are now establishing, and call on the working people and trade unions of all countries to resist this fraudulent organization. The Soviet delegation proposes that, in the name of the Congress, a letter be issued to trade union members in Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and other countries whose leaders have withdrawn from the WFTU, calling on them to disregard the divisive activities of reactionary trade union leaders, and to re-establish close ties and cooperation with the WFTU and its industrial trade departments; to call on trade union members, industrial unions, and local union committees in these countries to establish committees for cooperation with the WFTU in cities and enterprises where circumstances permit, and to take joint action with unions affiliated with the WFTU to defend the interests of the working class. The Congress resolution should emphasize that the doors of the WFTU remain open to all trade union organizations, including those whose leaders have withdrawn from the WFTU.

Solovyov added: The Soviet delegation proposes that the Congress must emphatically lodge a protest with the United Nations, protesting its violation of the legitimate rights of the WFTU, and protesting its obstructive behavior on issues of vital importance to the world's working people raised by the WFTU. We cannot but protest the fact that the UN Economic and Social Council has not resolved the issue of protecting trade union rights and freedoms, but has submitted it to the International Labor Office for handling. The ILO, for the benefit of employers, has replaced this issue with a general debate on the freedom to organize unions. The WFTU Executive Committee must be authorized to again demand that the United Nations grant the WFTU full representation in the United Nations as the world organization of the working class.

The Soviet delegation firmly believes that the WFTU will broadly expand its activities to carry out the great tasks stipulated in its charter, and the tasks that will be determined by this Congress of the WFTU. The Soviet delegation assures the Congress that the Soviet trade unions will always faithfully fulfill their international obligations and actively assist the activities of the WFTU.

　　索洛维耶夫在工联大会上演说
  　斥责加莱等分裂行动
    号召英美工人反对罪恶阴谋
    【新华社北平四日电】塔斯社米兰一日讯：在世界工联代表大会六月三十日会议上，苏联代表团团员和全苏职工会中央理事会书记索洛维耶夫发表演说。他在概述了世界工联在三年半以来保卫世界民主与和平等等活动以后，指出世界工联已成为战斗的权威的组织，成为帝国主义势力实施罪恶计划的严重障碍之一。索洛维耶夫继即斥责加莱、狄金和库伯斯等帝国主义帮凶分裂世界工人运动的罪恶行为。他说：苏联代表团建议代表大会批准世界工联目的在于改进工人阶级情况、保卫民主权利与自由、力争普遍的持久和平的工作。代表大会必须谴责分裂者现正建立的新的职工会联合会，并号召一切国家的劳动人民及各业职工会抵制这个骗人的组织。苏联代表团建议以代表大会的名义发表告英、美、荷、挪、丹、比及其他其领袖已退出世界工联的国家的职工会会员书，号召他们不顾反动职工会领袖的分裂活动，与世界工联及其各业职工部重新建立紧密的联系与合作；号召这些国家的职工会会员、产业工会及各地方性工会委员会，在情况许可的城市及企业中，建立为了与世界工联合作的委员会，并与世界工联所属工会联合行动，以保卫工人阶级的利益。代表大会决定中宜强调：世界工联的大门仍然是对一切职工会组织，包括其领袖退出世界工联的组织敞开着的。
    索洛维耶夫又说：苏联代表团建议代表大会必须着重地向联合国提出抗议，抗议它违反世界工联的合法权利，抗议它对于世界工联所提与世界劳动人民生命攸关的问题上采取阻碍的行为。我们不能不抗议联合国经社理事会不解决保卫职工会权利与自由的问题，而将之提交国际劳工局处理，该局为了雇主的利益，竟将这个问题代之以对组织工会自由的一般争论。世界工联执委会必须受权再度要求联合国给予世界工联在联合国中作为工人阶级的世界组织的充分代表权。
    苏联代表团坚信：世界工联将广泛扩大其活动，以执行会章中所规定的那些伟大任务，及本届世界工联代表大会所将规定的任务。苏联代表团向代表大会保证：苏联职工会将始终忠实地履行其国际义务，并积极地帮助世界工联的活动。
