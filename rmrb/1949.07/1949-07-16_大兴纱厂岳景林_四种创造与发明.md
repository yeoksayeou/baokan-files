    Bringing into Play the Wisdom of the Working Class
    Improving Tools to Develop Production
    In many liberated cities, thanks to the people's government, production competitions in various factories and mines have gradually become widespread. Under the call to restore and develop production and build new cities and a new China, the working class has highly demonstrated their work enthusiasm and creative wisdom, which is most concretely and clearly seen in the improvement of production tools. Here are a few examples.        Editor
    Yue Jinglin of Daxing Textile Factory
    Four Creations and Inventions
    Yue Jinglin is a yarn-winding group leader at the Shijiazhuang Daxing Textile Factory. He has been working for more than twenty years and suffered countless hardships in the old society: during the Kuomintang rule, he endured being ear-pulled, hit with rulers, and forced to kneel by foremen... During the enemy and puppet rule, he was arrested and beaten by Japanese invaders and taken to Osaka, Japan, for forced labor, and only returned to China after Japan surrendered. After liberation, he became a yarn-winding group leader. He works actively and constantly researches and figures out the machines. In the past year, he has had four inventions and creations.
    1. Replacing the Belt Pulley
    In the past, the belt pulley on the yarn-winding machine was inside the frame. When workers wound yarn, they often bumped into it, lightly grazing their arms and severely catching their hair, making it very dangerous, and the switches also took different amounts of effort. No one cared about these things before liberation. After liberation, he was still a maintenance worker and wanted to move the belt pulley to the outside of the frame. He modified one machine once, and the result was very smooth. With the consent of the administration, all yarn-winding machines were modified.
    2. Transforming the Yarn-Winding Dual-Purpose Wooden Spindle
    The wooden spindle on the yarn-winding machine is a two-inch-long round wooden stick. It is not a sophisticated mechanical part, but the wooden tube holes of new and old spinning machines are different sizes, some large and some small. If a small wooden tube is fitted onto a small wooden spindle during yarn-winding, it is very suitable, but if a small wooden spindle is fitted onto a large wooden tube, it will shake. When winding a bobbin of yarn, the wooden tube will be pulled up. In the past, when modifying the machine (i.e., replacing the wooden tube), some thread had to be wrapped around the wooden spindle to make the wooden tube stand firm. This not only wasted yarn but also wasted time. If it was changed to a small-hole wooden tube again, the wrapped yarn had to be removed. He often inspected the work in the workshop and felt it was inconvenient, so he wanted to make the wooden spindle dual-purpose. Finally, he figured out how to make the wooden spindle with one end large and one end small, and then attach the wooden tube, so that it could be used for both. Most of the wooden spindles on the yarn-winding machine have been converted to dual-purpose.
    3. Adding Axle Bowls and Collars to the Yarn-Winding Machine Axle Heads
    The packaging department often found oily yarn, because when winding yarn, the yarn-winding machine axle head leaked oil, or the yarn was contaminated when unloading yarn. Comrade Yue Jinglin came up with the idea of ​​using a collar to hold the axle sleeve in place to prevent it from窜ing outward. Afterwards, he asked a tin smith to make an oil bowl and weld it to the axle head, so that the yarn would never be stained with oil and reduce a lot of oily yarn.
    4. Creating a Broken Yarn Frame
    When winding yarn, some poorly spun yarn bolls from the spinning process are often found. It is difficult to wind, so they are picked out and made into yarn balls (for spinning thread or making yarn packages), but yarn balls are not easy to make. The bad yarn boll often jumps up from the wooden base where it is inserted, like a bird out of a cage, flying around, and even disturbing other threads. Sorting it out not only wastes the workers' time but also damages other yarns. When Yue Jinglin was making the collar, he planned to make a frame and insert those bad yarn bolls horizontally on the frame and then make them. Those bad yarn bolls will no longer be unable to draw out the yarn or break the ends due to the thick ends and thin middle, or the thick head and thin tail. After reporting the plan to the administration, he immediately received permission and support. After the carpenter made it according to his designed drawings, the problem was completely solved.

### 大兴纱厂岳景林  四种创造与发明

    发挥工人阶级的智慧
    改进工具发展生产
    在解放了的许多城市中，由于有了人民的政权，各厂、矿的生产竞赛，逐渐普遍地发动起来。工人阶级在恢复与发展生产，建设新城市、新中国的号召下，高度发挥了工作的积极性与创造的智慧，在生产工具的改进上看得最为具体，明白。这里便是几个例子。        编者
    大兴纱厂岳景林
    四种创造与发明
    岳景林是石家庄大兴纱厂一个摇纱组长，作工二十多年了，在旧社会，遭受过无数的磨难：国民党统治时代挨着工头的揪耳朵、打戒尺、罚跪……，在敌伪统治时代，曾被日寇抓捕毒打，带到日本大坂去作苦工，直到日本投降后才回国。解放后，当了摇纱组长，工作积极，对机器不断研究捉摸，一年来，曾有四种发明与创造。
    一、改换皮带盘
    过去摇纱车上的皮带盘，在车架里面，工人摇起纱来，常常碰着它，轻的磨胳膊，重的带头发，危险性更大，并且开关也不一样劲。解放前是没有人管这些的。解放后他那时还是保全工人，便想把皮带盘改到车架外头去，有一次他便改装了一部，结果很顺利。后经行政上的同意，把全部摇纱车统统改了。
    二、改造摇纱两用木锭子
    摇纱车上的木锭子，是一个两寸长的圆木棍，不是什么精细的机件，但过去的木锭子上下一样的粗细，而新老细纱机木管孔却不一样，有的大有的小，如果在摇纱时，细孔的木管按上小木锭子很合适，而粗孔的木管按上小木锭时，便摇晃，一络起线子来，木管便被带起来，过去改车时（即换用木管时）得把木锭子缠上些线，才能使木管站得稳固，但既浪费纱线，又耽误时间，如果再换成细孔木管时，还得把缠的纱线拔下来。他常在车间检查工作深觉不便，便想把木锭子改成两用的，最后他捉摸着把木锭子改成一头大一头小，再按上木管，便可两用了。摇纱车上的大部木锭子都改成两用的了。
    三、摇纱车轴头添轴碗与卡拉
    打包部常常发现纱线上有油纱，原因是摇纱时，摇纱车轴头，流出油来，或者是卸纱时染污了纱线所致。岳景林同志想出用一种卡拉把轴套卡住，不让它向外窜。之后又找焊锡匠打了一个油碗，焊在轴头上，这样纱再也沾不上油污，减少了许多油纱。
    四、创造打坏纱架子
    当摇纱时，常常发现由细纱而来的一些纺坏了的纱穗，摇纱不好摇，便剔出来打纱球（纺线绳或打纱包用），但打纱球并不好打，那个坏纱穗，常常从插着木座上跳起来，象个出笼的鸟，飞来飞去，甚至扰乱了其他的线。整理它不但耽误工人的时间而且损坏其他纱，岳景林正在作卡拉的时候，便计划作个架子，把那些坏纱穗子横着插在架子上再打，那些坏纱穗再不会因两头粗中间细，或头粗尾细而拉不出线来或断头了。当把计划报告行政后，即得到允许和赞助，当木工按照他设计的图样做好后，便完全解决了问题。
