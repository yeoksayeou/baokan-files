Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 24th: Reports from various sources: The Italian National Assembly debated the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty from July 15th to 21st. Communist, Socialist, and other progressive members of parliament spoke, exposing the aggressive nature of the treaty and the traitorous behavior of the Gasperi government, and firmly opposed the passage of the treaty. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti spoke in parliament on the 20th, explaining the aggressive essence of the treaty and its violation of the United Nations Charter, and strongly denounced the parliamentary majority attempting to pass the treaty. He said: The policy you are implementing is only tightening the shackles that bind Italy. You slavishly execute anti-Soviet policies, blocking Italy's path to joining the United Nations. You participate in all American conspiracies, exacerbating the contradictions between major powers. This step of yours drives the country onto the most dangerous of all possible paths, with the danger of dragging it into war, not for the benefit of the Italian nation, but exactly as Mussolini once threw us into the battlefield. Socialist Party General Secretary Nenni stated during the debate on the 19th that the North Atlantic Treaty is not only a fraud but also a complete betrayal. He declared to the parliamentary and government majority: "Turn back now while there is still time, and remember that if you do not do so, we will organize and destroy the plans of your policies before they cause any unfortunate consequences!" Independent left-wing parliamentarian Smitz stated in his speech that the Italian people have expressed their opinions in petitions, demanding that parliament instruct the government not to involve Italy in military alliances and not to grant other countries war bases within its territory. Although the government mobilized its entire police apparatus, radio, and newspapers, attempting to use threats and intimidation to prevent the collection of signatures on the petition, the Italian people's will to defend peace is so clear and powerful that millions of people, regardless of danger and threats, still signed the petition against the North Atlantic Treaty. Smitz stated: "One day, the people who signed the petition will demand an answer from you, and you will have to answer! At that time, neither deception nor intimidation nor arrest will save you!" However, despite widespread opposition and protests inside and outside the parliament, when the vote was taken on the 21st, the Italian National Assembly, with a reactionary majority, still passed the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty by 323 votes to 160.

　　意国民议会辩论批准北大西洋公约
  　托格里亚蒂坚决反对       
    南尼表示决摧毁反动计划
  　反动议员竟通过批准侵略公约
    【新华社北平二十四日电】各方报道：意大利国民议会于七月十五日至廿一日辩论批准北大西洋公约问题。共产党、社会党与其他进步议员，都在议会发言，揭露该公约的侵略本质与加斯贝利政府的卖国行为，并坚决反对通过该公约。意共领袖托格里亚蒂于廿日在议会发言，说明该公约的侵略实质与违反联合国宪章，痛斥企图通过该公约的议会多数派。他说：你们执行的那种政策，只是销紧束缚意大利的镣铐。你们奴颜婢膝地执行反苏政策，杜绝了意大利参加联合国的道路。你们参加一切美国的阴谋，加剧了大国之间的矛盾。你们的这一步骤，驱使国家走上一切可能的道路中最危险的道路，这里有把它卷入战争的危险，这不是为了意大利民族的利益，而恰恰象墨索里尼曾一度把我们投入战争屠场的那一次一样。社会党总书记南尼在十九日辩论时发言称，北大西洋公约不仅是一个骗局，而且是十足的背信弃义。他向着议会及政府多数派宣称：“趁现在还来得及时应赶快回头，并且记住，你们如果不这样做，我们就将在你们的政策酿成一切不幸后果之前，组织起来，摧毁你们政策的计划！”独立的左翼议员斯密思在发言时称：意大利人民在请愿书内表达了他们的意见，要求议会责成政府不要把意大利牵涉到军事同盟里去，不要在本国领土内给予其他国家以战争基地。虽然政府开动了全部警察机构、无线电及报刊，意图以威胁恫吓阻止征集请愿书的签名，但是，意大利人民保卫和平的意志是如此的明确和有力，数百万人民不顾危险和威胁，仍然在反对北大西洋公约的请愿书上签了名。斯密思称：“终有一天，在请愿书上签了名的人民，会要求你们答复，你们将非答复不可！那时，无论欺骗或威吓逮捕都救不了你们！”但是，不顾议会内外广泛的反对与抗议，至二十一日表决时，以反动派占多数的意大利国民议会，仍然以三百二十三票对一百六十票通过了批准北大西洋公约。
