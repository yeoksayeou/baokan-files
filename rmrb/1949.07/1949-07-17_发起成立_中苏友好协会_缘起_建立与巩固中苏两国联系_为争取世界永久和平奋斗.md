    The October Revolution unveiled a new page in human history. It broke through the front lines of capitalist imperialism, established a socialist state – the Soviet Union – on one-sixth of the earth, and opened up a practical path for the liberation cause of people worldwide. For more than thirty years, the development of the two systems, capitalism and socialism, in the world has presented a clear contrast: the former is becoming increasingly decadent and declining, its culture becoming increasingly backward and reactionary; the latter is thriving, its culture is booming, and its radiance is immense. The Chinese delegation attending the World Congress of Defenders of Peace had the opportunity to visit various aspects of Soviet construction, witnessing the strength of the Soviet state and the happiness of the people's lives, admiring it immensely. The facts clearly demonstrate that the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system. The direction of the Soviet Union is the direction that all mankind should take.

    The October Revolution gave the Chinese people's liberation cause a new look. The Soviet Union gave the Chinese people's liberation cause immense sympathy and help and treated China with true equality. All of this established the profound friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and without this friendship, the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people would certainly not have been easily successful.

    Now, the great cause of the Chinese revolution, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, has achieved a fundamental victory. In the future, our work, in addition to continuing to eliminate the remnants of the enemy, will be to carry out arduous economic construction and cultural construction, transforming our great motherland from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. In order to smoothly carry out this task, we must learn from the Soviet Union's rich experience in nation-building. We believe that genuine and friendly assistance for our country's future economic and cultural construction can only be found from the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union.

    The imperialists will not willingly withdraw from China from now on; they will certainly use every possible means to carry out conspiracies and tricks to sabotage and obstruct our peaceful construction work. To ensure the fruits of our revolutionary victory and peaceful construction work, we must unite with all nations and peoples in the world who treat us equally, and first of all, we must unite with our great friendly nation, the Soviet Union, to fight together against imperialist aggression and strive for permanent world peace.

    In view of this, we specially initiate the establishment of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association," whose mission is to establish and consolidate the cultural, economic, and other ties between China and the Soviet Union, introduce the Soviet Union's nation-building experience and science and technology, develop and consolidate the deep friendship between the two peoples, and strive for permanent world peace. It is hoped that patriotic compatriots from all walks of life in the country will work hard to realize this great task.

    发起成立“中苏友好协会”缘起
    建立与巩固中苏两国联系
    为争取世界永久和平奋斗
    十月革命揭开了人类历史的新的一页。它冲破了资本帝国主义的阵线，在地球六分之一上面创立了社会主义的国家——苏联，并给全世界人民解放事业开辟了现实的道路。三十余年来，世界上资本主义与社会主义两个体系的发展呈现为显明的对照：前者日趋腐朽、没落，其文化日益倒退、反动；后者则欣欣向荣，其文化蓬勃发展，光芒万丈。这次出席世界拥护和平大会的中国代表团，曾参观了苏联各方面的建设，目睹苏联国家之强盛和人民生活之幸福，倾慕不已。事实十分明白地表明了社会主义体系大大地优越于资本主义体系。苏联的方向乃是全人类应走的方向。
    十月革命使中国人民的解放事业面目为之一新。苏联对中国人民的解放事业给予莫大的同情和帮助，并以真正平等的态度对待中国。所有这些就树立了中苏两国人民的深厚友谊，而没有这个友谊，中国人民的革命事业是决然不易成功的。
    现在，中国革命大业在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，已经获得了基本的胜利。今后我们的工作，除继续肃清敌人的残余以外，将是进行艰巨的经济建设和文化建设，把我们伟大的祖国从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。为了顺利地执行这个任务，我们必须要学习苏联建国的丰富经验。我们相信，对于我国今后经济文化建设的真正的友谊的援助，只有从以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线这一方面去找。
    帝国主义者也不会从此就心甘意愿地退出中国的，他们一定还要利用一切的可能，实行阴谋诡计，来破坏和阻挠我们的和平建设工作。我们要保障我们革命胜利的果实及和平建设工作，就必须要联合世界上以平等待我之民族和各国人民，首先要联合我们的伟大友邦苏联，共同奋斗，反对帝国主义侵略势力，争取世界的永久和平。
    有鉴于此，我们特发起成立“中苏友好协会”，其任务是建立与巩固中苏两国文化经济和各方面的联系，介绍苏联的建国经验和科学技术，发展和巩固两国人民的深厚友谊，为争取世界永久和平而奋斗。希望全国各界爱国同胞，都能为实现这一伟大的任务而努力。      【新华社北平十六日电】
