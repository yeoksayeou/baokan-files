　　Looking Forward to the "Literary and Art Congress"
　　Zheng Zhenduo
　　This "Literary and Art Congress" represents an unprecedented great unity since the May Fourth Movement. Its significance is extremely important.
　　It is another literary and artistic revolution. It is another literary and artistic rebirth.
　　In the era of the May Fourth Movement, the banner held by literary and art workers was: opposing the feudal system and opposing imperialism. They were influenced by capitalist democratic ideas, but at the same time, they had a vague socialist tendency. But soon, the communist movement began. At this time, the common slogan was: "Art for life's sake." Afterwards, a large number of European literary works were introduced, and various literary theories and styles had a considerable impact on young literary writers. The Chinese literary scene in the ten years or so after the "May Fourth" presented a situation of a hundred voices competing and all streams flowing together.
　　The influence of the "May 30th" Movement gave many literary writers a more definite direction. They no longer hesitated, they no longer indulged in the description of trivial matters around them, they moved towards the correct path of socialist literature and art. At this time, Soviet literary theories and literary works were introduced in large quantities. The League of Left-Wing Writers became a central organization for the most progressive literary writers.
　　After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, many writers and artists immediately responded to the call of the motherland and devoted themselves to the national salvation front. However, the slogans of "literature joining the army" and "literature going to the countryside" encountered all kinds of obstruction and oppression from the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek regime, and became an unrealizable fantasy in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. However, in the areas of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, literary and art workers and workers, peasants, and soldiers immediately became one from the very beginning.
　　"Literature and art are for the masses of the people, and literature and art are written for workers, peasants, and soldiers."
　　This is no longer a slogan, but has become a practical experience of many years.
　　At the same time, in those years, literary and art workers in the KMT-controlled areas, with the exception of a very small number of dregs, were mostly able to do their best for the "united front against Japan" and for the left-wing literary movement. Under all kinds of persecution and obstruction, like eastward-flowing water, they were able to complete their due mission tortuously under the obstruction of all kinds of shoals, gorges, and piers. Its hardship was no less than that of literary and art workers who directly devoted themselves to the front line of the anti-Japanese war and among workers, peasants, and soldiers.
　　Now, under the call of the "National Literary and Art Congress," it is extremely important for us to gather together, exchange experiences with each other.
　　Now, we are divided and reunited, becoming one, and jointly embarking on the great road of serving the masses of the people, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Its power is extremely great, and its achievements will also be extremely great.

### “文代大会”的前瞻

　　“文代大会”的前瞻
    郑振铎
    这次的“文代大会”，表现着从五四运动以来不曾有过的一次大联合。其意义是极为重大的。
    是又一次的文艺革命。是又一次的文艺的新生。
    五四运动的时代，文艺工作者们所揭持着的大旗是：反对封建制度与反对帝国主义。他们是受着资本主义的民主主义思想的影响的，同时，却有着朦胧的社会主义的倾向。但不久，共产主义的运动也就开始了。这时候，共同的口号是：“为人生的艺术”。其后，欧洲的文艺作品大量的介绍进来，各式各样的文艺的理论和作风也都给年青的文艺作家们以相当的影响。而“五四”后十多年间的中国文坛上，乃呈现着百音竞奏、万流并进的现状。
    “五卅”运动的影响，使许多文艺作家们有了更确定的方向。他们不再徘徊歧路，他们不再迷恋于身边琐事的描述，他们是走向了社会主义的文艺的正确的路线。这时候，苏联的文艺理论和文艺作品大量的介绍进来。左翼作家联盟成为最进步的文艺作家们一个中心的组织。
    抗日战争起来以后，许多作家们，艺术家们立刻响应着祖国的号召，投身于救国的阵线里。但“文学入伍”，和“文学下乡”的口号，遇到了反动的蒋介石政权的百端阻挠与压迫，在国民党统治区域却成了不能实现的空想。不过，在八路军和新四军的区域，则文艺工作者们和工、农、兵们却一开头就打成了一片。
    “文艺是为了人民大众的，文艺是为了工、农、兵而写作的。”
    这已不是口号，而是有了好多年的实践的经验了。
    同时，那些年以来，在国统区的文艺工作者们，除了极少数的败类之外，大都是能够为“抗日的统一战线”，为左翼的文艺运动而尽力尽心的。他们在种种的迫害与阻挠之下，象东流的水似的，竟能在种种的滩石、狭峡、柢柱的阻挡之下，曲曲折折的完成了他们应尽的使命。其艰苦是不下于直接投身于抗日前线与工、农、兵之间的文艺工作者们的。
    现在，在“全国文代大会”的号召之下，彼此共聚一堂，互相交换着经验，那意义是异常的重要的。
    如今是，分而复合，打成一片，彼此共同走上了为人民大众，为工、农、兵服务的大道上去。其力量是极大的，其成就也将是极大的。
    一九四九、六、二十五写。
