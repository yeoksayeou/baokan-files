　　Chapter Sixteen: Love and Hate

　　Pomegranate flowers are red as fire,
　　I love you, and you love me.
　　There are as many young people as grains of sand,
　　Why do you only love me?
　　—Folk song

　　I.
　　The victory of rent reduction was soon followed by spring. Hei Lao Cai took the time to bring up the marriage issue of Da Shui and Xiao Mei at the county committee meeting. The comrades all agreed that they should have gotten married long ago. At this time, Niu Da Shui was serving as the Party Secretary in his original district, and Yang Xiao Mei had already been transferred to work in the County Women's Federation. Hei Lao Cai talked to them and decided to get married on March 8th; the county and district committees each contributed some money to help them prepare.

　　March 8th arrived. They were afraid that the common people would spend money and give gifts, so they didn't spread the news of the wedding. During the day, everyone was busy with their work, and in the afternoon, the male and female comrades from the county sent Xiao Mei to the district. District Squad Leader Gao Tun'er and several team members were busy cleaning up. District Chief Jiao, wearing an apron, came out of the kitchen, smiling, and said, "You're all here! Today is their wedding day, and I'm the chef. Take a look at my skills." Sister Chen said with a smile, "If the District Chief is doing it himself, there can't be any mistakes, right?" Tian Ying busily asked, "Is the bridal chamber ready?" Xiu Nv'er shouted from the west room, "The bridal chamber is here!"

　　Everyone went in and saw three comrades from the District Women's Association laughing and decorating, busy as could be. The window paper had been replaced with new ones and decorated with red paper-cuts. On the kang, there was a new quilt with a bright red cloth cover and white sheets, all issued by the county and district committees. Xiu Nv'er was standing on the table opposite the kang, putting up a picture on the wall; it was a "Twin Lotus" with red flowers and green leaves painted by Grain and Forage Director Gu Zichun.

　　As soon as Xiu Nv'er saw Xiao Mei, she jumped down, took her hand, and asked with a smile, "Bride! Do you see any flaws in the bridal chamber we've prepared for you?" Xiao Mei, blushing, said, "You're getting married soon too, and you're still so naughty!" Tian Ying took out a pair of new pillows she had made and placed them on the kang. Other comrades brought towels, soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and notebooks… Comrade Cheng Ping couldn't come because he was busy, but he sent a pair of congratulatory scrolls, which Xiu Nv'er pasted on both sides of the painting; black, glossy characters were written on the bright red paper:

　　The new people overthrow the old system
　　Old comrades become a new couple
　　There was also a horizontal inscription, pasted above, with four large characters:
　　Revolutionary Love

　　Hei Lao Cai also sent a pair of couplets, which read:

　　Fighting the Japanese is what makes good sons and daughters
　　Saving China is what makes true heroes
　　The horizontal inscription had four vigorous characters:
　　Fighting Companions

　　Just as they were about to paste it up, Gu Zichun came in happily, holding a large sheet of paper in both hands, and said, "Come and see! Come and see!" Everyone gathered around to look. It turned out to be a congratulatory message composed by District Chief Jiao and Gao Tun'er, and written by Gu Zichun, the ink wasn't even dry yet. Gu Zichun deliberately read it out loud so that Yang Xiao Mei could hear it; he read each sentence with great energy:

　　Niu Da Shui is full of courage,
　　Warming Yang Xiao Mei's heart!
　　The couple works hard to resist Japan,
　　They're sure to become more and more passionate!

　　The comrades laughed and said, "Good! Good! Good!" They pasted it together with the couplets and horizontal inscription sent by Hei Lao Cai.

　　II.
　　Everyone joked for a while. Hei Lao Cai suddenly remembered and said, "Hey, where's our Da Shui?" Xiu Nv'er ran out and said, "I'll go find him." Niu Da Shui was hiding in the east room, feeling happy and flustered, not knowing what to do. He heard that Xiao Mei was coming. His heart was pounding, and his face was burning hot; afraid of being laughed at, he didn't dare to go out and pretended to read a newspaper while lying on the kang, but he couldn't take in a single word. When Xiu Nv'er saw him come in, she clapped her hands and shouted, "Come and see, the groom is still studying here!" She snatched the newspaper and pulled him away. The comrades all laughed and came out to see Da Shui, Da Shui's face was red, and he just grinned.

　　The district cadres were busy serving the meal, and the comrades from the county helped out. In the large room to the north, three square tables were joined together in a row, with two long benches placed alongside. The District Chief and others brought the dishes, placing a large basin of meat and a large basin of fish at each end, along with two plates of cold dishes—one with vermicelli, tofu, and cabbage, and the other with cabbage, tofu, and vermicelli. Everyone sat or stood, eating rice and dishes, talking and laughing, and had a great time.

　　Gao Tun'er noticed that Da Shui had only eaten two bowls and put down his chopsticks, so he grabbed his hand and shouted, "This won't do! You usually eat five or six cornbread buns, how come you're eating so little today?" Everyone chimed in and shouted, "No way! No way! We won't let him get married until he's full!" Da Shui smiled and embarrassedly ate another large bowl, but he really had a good appetite!

　　It got dark. The villagers were well-informed, and although they had tried to keep it a secret, they all knew. A lot of people came, and some from other villages also came to join in; the big room was crowded, and even the courtyard was full of people, it was so lively. Niu Xiao Shui and a few others ran over happily, they found a pair of red gauze lanterns that were used for the New Year and lit them brightly, hanging them in the big room. The red light shone on the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on the wall, on the cheerful people in the room, and also on the smiling couple. The captured phonograph played "The Laughter of the Foreign Devils," laughing in a chaotic and jarring way, which made everyone burst out laughing.

　　Xiu Nv'er and the others ran in, pinned two red flowers they had made on Da Shui and Xiao Mei's chests, and forced them to sit on a bench. Ma Danxiao and Wu Quan'er poured two large baskets of peanuts and dates on the table. A little boy came in excitedly with a large teapot, pouring water for everyone. The wedding began.

　　III.
　　Gu Zichun was the master of ceremonies. Everyone stood up and bowed to the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Da Shui and Xiao Mei then stood in front and bowed to the images of the two people's leaders; then they bowed to the introducer and the guests. Gu Zichun shouted with his neck stretched out, "Bride and groom—bow to each other!" Da Shui honestly turned around, stood up straight, and prepared to bow to Xiao Mei; Xiao Mei turned her face and saw Da Shui standing respectfully in front of her, and couldn't help but burst out laughing, then turned and ran. Everyone in the room laughed, shouting, "No, no! You have to bow deeply!" The women pushed Xiao Mei forward, and Xiao Mei hurriedly bowed, and Da Shui quickly returned the courtesy.

　　Everyone sat down, and it was time for the witness to speak. Hei Lao Cai was both the witness and the introducer; he stood up smiling, his eyes swept over everyone, and said, "Comrades! Today's wedding of comrades Da Shui and Xiao Mei is worth celebrating. They participated in the revolution together and were tempered together in the cruel struggle, both becoming excellent revolutionary soldiers. I am truly unspeakably happy! In the past, in the old society, their marriage was not their own choice and they suffered a lot; now, under the Anti-Japanese Democratic Government, these two old comrades have become a new couple, and their future life will definitely be beautiful and happy! However, the enemy has not yet been defeated, and the arduous struggle is still ahead; I hope that you two, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will work harder, help each other, criticize each other, and continue to make progress! Finally…" looking at Da Shui and Xiao Mei, he winking playfully, said, "I hope you will have a chubby baby next year to add a descendant to the revolution!" which made everyone laugh.

　　Next was the guest speech. Li Ershu from Shenjia Village walked to the front with a smile, holding four red paper packages, and put the packages on the table. He swept off his felt hat, revealing his shiny bald head, and bowed very comically, saying, "Today, Da Shui and Xiao Mei are getting married, and everyone in the village is happy from the bottom of their hearts! Everyone wanted to chip in to give them gifts and banners, but the government didn't allow it; there was no other way, so we put together four little trinkets to express our feelings, and everyone came up with four sentences—"

　　Speaking of this, Li Ershu proudly raised a red paper package and recited aloud, "Da Shui Xiao Mei, two flowers—this is a package of peanuts!" He raised the second red paper package: "Wholeheartedly working for us—this is a package of snacks!" Everyone laughed as they listened. He raised the third package and read, "Defeat the devils and live in peace soon—what do you think this is?—Dates!" Finally, he raised the fourth package high and recited in an even louder voice, "Final victory, laugh heartily—haha… these are pears!" Everyone laughed heartily as they listened, clapping and cheering.

　　Gu Zichun shouted loudly again: "Eighth item—bride and groom shake hands!" The male comrades embraced Da Shui, and the female comrades embraced Xiao Mei, and they walked together from both sides. Da Shui's arms were grabbed by several people and stretched out. Xiao Mei twisted her face, too ashamed to bear, and the comrades raised her arms. Two red faces smiled like clouds, and two hot, sweaty hands were clasped together. The comrades applauded and laughed, embracing them into the new room.

　　IV.
　　A red octagonal lantern was also hung in the new room. The comrades joked around for a while in a lively atmosphere. The comrades from the county rushed back; the District Chief and others casually closed the door of the new room and rested. Only Da Shui and Xiao Mei were left. Xiao Mei sat on the edge of the kang, smiling with her head lowered. Da Shui gently closed the door, turned around, and didn't know what to do for a moment.

　　The lamplight shone redly, Xiao Mei raised her head, her face looked very radiant, her eyes looked at Da Shui like two puddles of water and said: "Are you tired? Sit down and rest!" Da Shui sat on a stool next to Xiao Mei, smiling and staring at Xiao Mei without turning his eyes. Xiao Mei pursed her lips and smiled, showing two dimples on her blushing face. She asked embarrassedly: "What are you looking at? Haven't you seen me before?" Da Shui said, "I was thinking about when you used to come to your sister's house, you still had a braid, and when you saw a stranger, you didn't even dare to lift your head. Later, when you were training, you would cry when you couldn't speak, the two of us in the class were really a pair of fools, I laugh when I think about it!" Xiao Mei said: "We two practical gourds are really one vine! … Do you still remember when you broke your tobacco pipe?" The two looked at each other and laughed.

　　After chatting for a while, the red light slowly dimmed. The two of them went to bed to rest. Xiao Mei stroked Da Shui's scarred body, tears suddenly welled up, dripping on the bend of Da Shui's arm; she whispered: "Da Shui! That night you were rolled up in a quilt and carried in, what did the enemy do to you! It really broke my heart!" She put her face against Da Shui's neck and said: "You are so determined! You are really good! You are true gold that has been tempered by fire!" Da Shui said with a trembling voice: "You and the comrades care for me, you really cared for me with everything you have! If it weren't for your patient care, I wouldn't be able to survive!" Xiao Mei said: "Revolution is really a big family; see how everyone treats each other like relatives!"

　　Da Shui thought of his old man, and couldn't help but shed tears and said: "Alas, if my dad were alive, seeing us get married, he would be so happy! The first time your sister came to propose marriage, it would have been so good if it had been successful!" Xiao Mei said: "I was willing at that time, but how could I have been in charge of myself!" Da Shui kissed Xiao Mei and said: "If it weren't for participating in the revolution, the two of us would never have been able to get together!"

　　The light went out. The two of them hugged each other tightly, and it felt like a piece of candy was slowly melting in their hearts; for a long, long time, they were still whispering to each other.

　　V.
　　The news of Niu Da Shui and Yang Xiao Mei's marriage reached the ears of Zhang Jinlong in the town. Zhang Jinlong gritted his teeth and said to Guo San Mazi: "I f*** his sister! That bad seed Niu Da Shui, I knew he had no good intentions! I should have killed him with one knife back then, how happy would that have been!" San Mazi sneered and said: "Don't be angry, I think you've been a cuckold for a long time!" Zhang Jinlong said fiercely: "Let's see, sooner or later I'll have them both die in my hands!"

　　新儿女英雄传
    孔厥　袁静
    第十六回　爱和仇
    石榴花儿红似火，
    我疼你来你疼我。
    年轻人多得象细沙，
    你为什么单爱我？
　　——民歌
    一
    减租胜利，转眼又是春天了。黑老蔡抽空儿把大水小梅的婚姻问题，在县委会上提出来，同志们全体赞成，说他俩早该结婚了。这时候，牛大水在原来的区上当区委书记，杨小梅已经调到县妇联会工作。黑老蔡找他俩谈好了，决定三八节结婚；县委区委都拿出了一些钱，帮助他们筹备起来。
    三八节到了。他们怕老百姓花钱、送礼，没有把结婚的消息传出去。白天，大家忙了一气工作，后半晌，县上的男女同志们送小梅到区上来了。区小队长高屯儿和几个队员正在忙着打扫收拾。焦区长身上围了一块布，从伙房里出来，笑嘻嘻的说：“你们都来啦！今儿个他俩结婚，是我的掌勺，你们瞧瞧我的把式吧。”陈大姐笑着说：“区长亲自动手，还有个错儿呀？”田英忙着问：“新房布置了没有？”秀女儿在西屋喊：“新房在这儿呢！”
    大家走进去，看见区妇会的三位同志，正在咭咭呷呷的笑着布置，忙了个手脚不闲。窗户纸都换了新的，还贴了红的剪花。炕上，是大红布面的新被子，白被单儿、都是县委区委给发的。秀女儿站在炕对面的桌子上，正在往墙上贴画儿，是粮秣主任谷子春画的红花绿叶“并蒂莲”。
    秀女儿一见小梅，忙跳下来，拉住她的手笑着问：“新娘子！你看我们给你收拾的新房，还有什么缺点儿呀”小梅红着脸儿，说：“你也快结婚了，还这么淘气！”田英把自己做的一对新枕头拿过去摆好。旁的同志有送手巾、胰子的，有送牙刷、牙粉的，还有送笔记本的……程平同志有事顾不得来，他可送了一付喜联，秀女儿把它贴在画的两边；鲜红的纸上写着黑得发亮的字：
　　新人儿推倒旧制度
　　旧伴侣结成新夫妇
　　还有一付横额，贴在上边，写着四个大字：
　　革命的爱
　　黑老蔡也送了一付对联，写的是：
　　打日本才算好儿女
　　救中国方是真英雄
　　横额上写着生龙活虎的四个大字：
　　战斗伴侣
    正要贴，忽然谷子春喜冲冲的走进来，两手拿着一张大纸，说：“快来看！快来看！”大家围上去看，原来是焦区长和高屯儿两个编的祝词，叫谷子春写的，那墨迹还没干呢。谷子春故意高声念出来，好给杨小梅听见；一句一句念得怪有劲儿：
    牛大水勇气勃勃，
    温暖了杨小梅的心窝！
    两口子努力抗战，
    准是越干越热火！
    同志们听了大笑，说：“好好好！”就把它跟黑老蔡送的对联、横额贴在一块儿。
    二
    大家说了一阵笑话。黑老蔡忽然想起来，说：“咦，咱们的大水呢？”秀女儿跑出去说：“我去找他。”牛大水躲在东屋，心里乐滋滋、乱麻麻的，不知道做什么好。听见小梅来了。他心儿扑通扑通乱跳，脸上烫得不行；怕给人瞧见笑话，不敢出去，一个人歪在炕上，假装拿起一张报纸看着，可一个字也没有看进去。秀女儿进来瞧见了，就拍着手，大声嚷嚷起来：“你们都来瞧瞧，新郎官还在这儿学习呢！”一把抢了报纸，拉着他就走。同志们都笑着出来看大水，大水满脸都红了，咧着个大嘴只是笑。
    区干部忙着开饭，县上的同志也动手帮忙。在北边的大屋子里，用三张方桌并成一溜，旁边放了两条长板凳。区长他们把菜端来，两头都放了一大盆肉，一大盆鱼，还配搭两碟子凉菜——一碟子是粉条豆腐白菜，一碟子是白菜豆腐粉条。大伙儿坐的坐，站的站，吃着大米干饭，就着菜，有说有笑的，吃了个欢。
    高屯儿发现大水只吃了两碗，就放筷子了，马上抓住他的手喊：“这可不行！你平常总要吃五六个窝窝头，今儿个怎么吃少啦？”众人随口同声的嚷起来：“通不过！通不过！不吃饱不让他结婚！”大水笑着，不好意思的又吃了一大碗，可吃得真开胃啊！
    天黑下来了。老乡们消息挺灵通，虽然瞒着也都知道了。来的人真不少，有些外村的也赶来参加了；大屋子里挤不下，连院里都站满了人，可热闹啦。牛小水几个快活得蹦蹦跳跳的跑来，他们找了一对过年用的红纱灯，点得亮亮的，在大屋子里挂了起来。红光照着墙上毛主席、朱总司令的像，照着满屋子喜气洋洋的人们，也照着一对笑迷迷的新夫妇。缴获来的话匣子，唱“洋人大笑”，叽哩呷啦的乱笑一气，逗得大伙儿全笑开了。
    秀女儿她们跑进来，把自个做的两朵红花，给大水小梅别在胸前，硬拉他俩坐在一条板凳上。马胆小和五圈儿把两大篮花生枣儿倒在桌子上。小小子提着一把大茶壶，兴头头的进来，给大家倒上水。婚礼就开始举行了。
    三
    谷子春司仪。全体起立，向毛主席朱总司令的像鞠了躬。大水小梅又站在前面，给两位人民领袖的像鞠躬；接着又给介绍人和来宾鞠躬。谷子春直着脖子喊：“新郎新娘——相对一鞠躬！”大水老老实实的转过身来，站得笔直，准备给小梅鞠躬；小梅一扭脸，瞧见大水规规矩矩的对她站着，忍不住噗哧一笑，转身就跑。满屋子人都笑起来，喊着：“不行不行！得鞠一个大躬！”妇女们推小梅到前面，小梅慌慌张张的鞠了一躬，大水也忙着还礼。
    大伙儿坐好，该证婚人讲话了。黑老蔡又是证婚人，又是介绍人；他笑迷迷的站起来，眼光向全体扫了一下，说：“同志们！今天大水小梅两位同志结婚，很值得咱们庆贺。他俩一块儿参加革命，又一块儿从残酷的斗争里锻炼出来，都成了很好的革命战士，我心里真是说不出的高兴！过去，在旧社会，他俩的婚姻不能自主，受了许多痛苦；现在，在抗日民主政府下面，他两个老战友，结成了新夫妇，以后的生活一定很美满幸福！可是，敌人还没有打倒，艰苦的斗争还在前面；希望你们俩，在共产党的领导下，更努力的工作，互相帮助，互相批评，不断的进步！最后……”看着大水和小梅，开玩笑的＠①＠①眼睛，说：“希望你俩明年生个胖娃娃，给革命添个后代！”说得大家都笑了。
    接着是来宾讲话。申家庄的李二叔笑呵呵的捧着四个红纸包儿，走到前面，把纸包儿放在桌子上。他—把抹下毡帽头，露出发亮的光脑瓜儿，很滑稽的鞠了一个躬，说：“今儿大水小梅俩结婚，哪一个老百姓的心眼儿里，都欢喜得不成！大伙儿想凑份子给他们送礼、送幛子，公家都不叫送；没办法，只好凑了四样小玩艺儿，表表咱们的心意，大伙儿还琢磨了四句话——”
    说到这儿，李二叔得意的举起一个红纸包儿，高声念：“大水小梅两朵花——这是一包花生！”又举起第二个红纸包：“一心工作为了咱——这是一包点心！”大家听着笑起来。他又举起第三个包儿，念：“打败鬼子早安乐——你们猜这是什么？——是枣儿！”末了，他高高的举起第四个包儿，扯着嗓子更高声的念：“最后胜利笑哈哈——哈哈……这是梨儿！”听得谁都笑哈哈了，一齐拍手叫好。
    谷子春又高声的喊：“新郎新娘——报告恋爱经过！”这就更热闹了。人们乱哄哄的。牛大水先给拉了起来，站在前面。他穿了一身灰布的新制服，头上戴着新军帽，一朵红花别在胸前。他满面红光，笑呵呵的说：“这可叫我说什么呀？我跟她…没个什么恋爱经过！”大伙儿嚷：“不说不行！”大水说：“可当真没有嘛！”有人说：“你说说，你们俩亲过嘴儿没有？”大水满脸是笑，可又皱着眉头说：“这话可太不象问题啦！我两个一块儿工作这么些年，真是小葱拌豆腐——一清二白；别说亲嘴，就连个手指头也没有挨过一下！”
    小水躲在人背后，喊着问：“你想挨了没有？”大水笑嘻嘻的坦白说：“想是想来着；我心眼儿里早就爱上她啦！”他连忙抓下军帽，鞠了个躬，逃下去了。
    同志们大笑；说：“该小梅说啦！”小梅早把脸儿藏在秀女儿的身后面，笑着不出来。女同志们都拉她。小梅推脱不过，就拢了拢头发站起来。她穿着日常的袄儿，外面罩一件干干净净的蓝布褂子，大襟上也别着红花。她一时不知道说什么好，想了半天，才红着脸儿说：“他……他心里爱我，我……这事儿也不知在心里过过多少回啦！”说完，就搂着陈大姐说：“我可真没说的啦！”
    一阵笑声里，谷子春又喊：“第八项——新郎新娘握手！”男同志们拥着大水，女同志们拥着小梅，两边走拢来。大水的胳膊给好几个人抓着伸出来。小梅扭着脸儿，臊得不行，同志们把她的胳膊抬起来。两个红红的脸儿笑得象云彩一样，两只热得出汗的手儿就握在一起啦。同志们鼓掌大笑，把他俩拥进新房里去。
    四
    新房里也挂了个八角红灯。同志们热热闹闹的耍笑了一阵。县上的同志赶着回去了；区长他们随手把新房的门儿带上，也都歇息了。剩下大水小梅两个。小梅坐在坑沿上，笑迷迷的低着头儿。大水轻轻的插上门，回过身来，一时不知道怎么着才好。
    灯光红映映的照着，小梅抬起头来，脸上显得很光彩，眼睛跟两洼水儿似的望大水说：“你累不？坐下歇歇吧！”大水坐在小梅旁边的一个凳子上，笑嘻嘻的，不转眼儿看着小梅。小梅抿着嘴儿笑，羞红的脸上显出两个酒窝儿。她不好意思的问：“你看什么？还没有见过我呀？”大水说：“我想着你从前到姊姊家来，还梳着个辫子呢，瞧见个生人，连头也不敢抬。后来受训的时候，发不上言就哭，咱们俩在班上，可真是一对傻蛋儿，我一想起来就好笑！”小梅说：“咱两个实葫芦，真是一根滕儿！……你还记得你抉烟袋杆儿不？”两个人对看着笑了起来。
    说了一阵闲话，红灯慢慢儿暗下去了。他俩就上炕歇息。小梅抚摩着大水满身的伤痕，眼泪突然涌出来，滴在大水的胳膊弯儿上；她轻声轻语的说：“大水啊！那天晚上你在被窝里卷着抬进来，你给敌人拾掇成了什么样儿！真把我心痛得不行啊！”她脸儿贴着大水的脖子说：“你真坚决！真是好样儿的！你是火炼过的真金啊！”大水激动得声音发抖说：“你和同志们疼我，疼得真没处疼啦！要没你们耐心的招护，我出来也活不了！”小梅说：“革命真是个大家庭；你看谁对谁都跟亲人一样！”
    大水想起了老爹，忍不住掉泪说：“唉，我爹要活着，瞧见咱们结婚，不定多乐呢！头一回你姐姐来说亲，要成功了，该多好啊！”小梅说：“那时候我才愿意呢，可怎么由得了自己呀！”大水亲着小梅说：“要不是参加革命，咱们俩怎么也到不了一块儿！”
    灯熄了。他两个紧紧的抱着，心里象有块糖儿在慢慢的化；很久很久的，还唧唧哝哝说着话儿。
    五
    牛大水杨小梅结婚的消息，传到镇上张金龙耳朵里了。张金龙咬牙切齿的对郭三麻子说：“我操他妹子！牛大水这个坏种，我早就知道他没安好心眼儿！我那会儿要一刀杀了他，该多痛快呀！”三麻子冷笑说：“你也别生气，我看你早就当上王八了！”张金龙狠狠的说：“咱们瞧吧，早晚得叫他俩死在我手里！”
