Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: A certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army's Second Field Army universally launched the "Strong Soldiers and Horses, Consolidate the Troops" campaign in the troops before and after crossing the Yangtze River. This campaign has received the attention of the Political Department of the Field Army, which called on the entire army to treat the health of personnel and horses as an important and regular task in the troops, to make this work universal and in-depth, and to ensure the victory of the continued great advance. When carrying out this campaign, the regiment put forward many specific methods, such as universally vaccinating the soldiers twice and giving each person six quinine pills to prevent epidemics; many companies often prepared Rendan, ginger, garlic, tea, etc., for use in case of illness. The regiment also established permanent health soldier groups and water-boiling groups, which actively and effectively promoted the health work of the troops. In order to reduce the fatigue of the soldiers, the Second Battalion of the regiment proposed that each person should not stand guard more than twice a night in combat situations. In administrative management, the principle of "combining love and strictness" was put forward, that is, strict administrative management combined with caring for the lives of the soldiers. During marching, it is required to master and adhere to the marching route, marching speed, length of rest periods, and the foot-washing system after entering the camp, to reduce the fatigue of the troops. In terms of cleanliness and hygiene, the regiment put forward the slogan: "Actively prevent and eliminate diseases, turn major illnesses into minor illnesses, and eliminate minor illnesses." On the issue of the health of mules and horses, it should be done: (1) Not only feed them at dawn and dusk, but also feed them at night. (2) After drinking, they should be walked. (3) Special attention should be paid to rainy days or when marching uphill and downhill in the second half of the day to avoid falling livestock. Since the launch of this campaign, the regiment has achieved significant results. For example, the Second Battalion of the regiment has only had six people fall ill since the crossing of the Yangtze River, and the rest have remained healthy throughout.
