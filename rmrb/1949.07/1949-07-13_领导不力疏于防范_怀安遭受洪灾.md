[Chahar News] On June 27th, most areas of Huai'an suffered severe hail and flood disasters. The Charnan Special Prefecture has allocated 3,000 catties of relief grain and a portion of seeds to the affected areas, instructing the county to quickly lead the masses in crash replanting. There are several reasons for the flood disaster suffered by the county this time: First, there are two flood discharge and flood control canal dams near Huai'an City, but the riverbanks, canal embankments, and dam dikes have been in disrepair for many years, and the protective forests have been cut down and destroyed. This spring, the county government planned to repair the canals, but some cadres and the masses emphasized the difficulties, and the leadership's determination wavered. Due to inadequate inspection, the canals were not repaired before the rainy season arrived, leading to flooding. Second, when constructing water conservancy projects in the spring, most areas adopted separate plans based on villages, and the construction was carried out in a decentralized manner. The leadership did not make comprehensive and thorough plans, and only focused on developing water conservancy, neglecting flood control and siltation projects. Therefore, the Charnan Special Prefecture has issued a special order to all counties to learn from the lessons, rush to repair dikes and dams, unify leadership, and combine water conservancy construction with flood control and siltation prevention to prevent flood disasters.

　　领导不力疏于防范
  　怀安遭受洪灾
    【察哈尔讯】六月廿七日怀安大部地区遭严重雹灾洪患，察南专署已拨给受灾区三千斤救济粮和一部籽种，指示该县赶速领导群众突击改种。该县此次遭受洪患有以下几个原因：一、怀安城附近有两道放水防洪渠坝，但河沿、渠塄、坝堤年久失修，护堤树林又被砍伐破坏，今春县府计划修渠，但部分干部和群众强调困难，领导上决心动摇。疏于检查，雨季到来还未修好，致洪汛成灾。二、春季兴修水利时，大部地区均采取以村为单位单独计划，分散修筑，领导上未做全面周密计划，只顾开展水利，忽略防洪放淤工程。为此，察南专署特通令各县接受教训，赶修堤坝，统一领导，使兴修水利与防洪放淤结合，以防洪灾。
