    Yongjin on the Beining Line
    
    A Peaceful Train
    On the 25th, this reporter took the "Forward" train along the Beining Line northeast. The moment you step into the station, your tense mood when boarding will calm down; the noisy and chaotic scenes belong to a bygone era.
    
    Two young attendants on the train excitedly recounted the past and present of the train. They seemed even more excited when talking about their work: "Now the superiors see our work. If anyone doesn't do well, everyone offers suggestions to each other. If we do well, we get praised." You can clearly see that workers who have been liberated not long ago have begun to grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. There is nothing dirty on the clean floor under your feet. When I asked them how many times they sweep the floor, they said: Sweep whenever it gets dirty. They immediately recalled the scolding and beatings they suffered in the past for sweeping the floor. During the Kuomintang and when the rich people defecated, they even had to hand them the toilet paper. One person would occupy the seats of several people, and if their tickets were checked, you could prepare your face to be slapped. The attendant surnamed Zhang cited facts within three meters: Look how honest the People's Liberation Army are. Among several soldiers, two are dozing off, two are studying, and one is facing the window, occasionally hearing his slight singing from the rumbling of the wheels, which is much quieter than the voices of the two girls beside them.
    
    I also spoke with a soldier of the Northeast People's Liberation Army. He joined the Northeast People's Liberation Army the year before last and lives in Lishu. Now he works in the Railway Corps. He participated in the Battle of Jilin. He told me about the glorious achievements of the heroes in the battles of Siping, Shenyang, and Jinzhou in the Northeast.
    
    From Tianjin to Kailuan
    In the past, the first thing that caught the eye in Tianjin was the continuous salt piles along the coast of Lunan, like hills. This is the famous Changlu salt production area, with nearly 300,000 mu of salt fields. People at the station told me that more than 4,000 salt police had been abolished, and the salt farmers had gained freedom. The output in May was more than double that of April (nearly three million dan in May). Now Changlu salt can be transported without hindrance to Chahar South, Hebei East, Hebei South, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the Zhengtai Line, and the Henan North Pinghan Line. In this area, you can't see the green crops, only the boundless salt flats. Salt workers and salt farmers are working, either transporting salt from small ditches to large salt fields. Windmills are turning, and the famous yellow croaker is produced in this area.
    
    When the train reached the Luan River, people on the train naturally stuck their heads out of the windows, praising the restoration of the Luan River Railway Bridge. The train traveled slower on the bridge. The Luan River Railway Bridge, which is 650 meters long, and the Yinma River Railway Bridge, which is 150 meters long, and 115 bridges of various sizes were mostly destroyed by the Kuomintang. The Luan River Railway Bridge was destroyed in six places by the enemy. When General Lin Biao's army poured into Shanhaiguan, the Beining Line was quickly opened to traffic on January 20th.
    
    Long before the train left the Luan Coal Mine, coal piles could be seen. After liberation, the output of Kailuan Coal Mine workers has been increasing day by day, exceeding the coal production standard of the past three years, from 2,300 tons per day to 12,000 tons. When traveling east to Kailuan Coal Mine, groups of workers walked out of the coal mine, filled with the joy of labor, singing songs as they walked back to their homes.
    
    You can calculate that in less than half an hour or one or two minutes, trains will pass each other, carrying a large number of sleepers, rails, and food from the fertile Northeast into Shanhaiguan to support the front lines and help with the construction inside Shanhaiguan. On this line, it is easiest to think of the bright future of New Democratic construction.
    
    A Symbol of Harvest
    From Tangshan to Qinhuangdao, this area of hundreds of miles has the most sorghum, which is very consistent with the farmer's proverb: "After the wheat is gone, the sorghum is taller than the ox." This year, the wheat harvest in Zunhua, Yutian, Qian'an, Funing, Lulong, Changli, and Luanxian is more than 100 jin per mu. The sorghum east of Tangshan is as green as the sea. There are the most sweet potatoes on this line, and the sweet potato vines are already one or two feet long. There is no drought or insect pests here, of course, taking the train is even worse than "riding a horse and looking at flowers." In addition, there is also a lot of cotton, and there are also many peanuts in the area near Qinhuangdao to the east. No matter what kind of crop, the rows are always so neat, and there are very few weeds in the rows.
    
    The most and very lush grass is in the low-lying areas on both sides of the railway (there are no crops within ten meters on both sides of the railway). Herds are moving under the whips of children, and the songs of the herders are drowned out by the sound of the train.
    
    A passenger from Changli told me many stories about General Li Yunchang fighting guerrilla warfare with the enemy here. At the foot of Phoenix Mountain in Changli County are dense orchards, where apples, apricots, grapes, and pears are produced. Every village is deeply immersed in dense forests, and it is regrettable that the Kuomintang bandits cut down many fruit trees here.
    
    The Free Bohai Coast
    The train passes through fields and villages, and after passing the summer resort of Beidaihe, Qinhuangdao rushes towards us.
    
    We walked along a unique limestone road in Qinhuangdao towards the seaside, where coal from Kailuan is being prepared for export. What is most exciting and pleasant is that this sea area also belongs to the people themselves. Workers and students put down their fishing rods on the beach, and in a short period of time, they will pull out sea rabbits (i.e., cuttlefish) or large fish weighing several kilograms from the sea. They told me that in the past, let alone fishing here, even standing here would be threatened and beaten.
    
    From Matou to the summer resort of Beidaihe, the sea water in this area is calm, and fishing boats can freely fish. No more arrogant troops take the fish without paying. A fisherman interestingly told me: "The People's Liberation Army sometimes helps to catch fish for half a day. When they leave, even if you give them fish, they don't want it, and they don't even eat if you invite them to dinner." Several ships staying on the Bohai Sea are flying red flags high. Outside the pier, waves are rolling, and fishing boats are emerging in the waves. On the Bohai coast of the people, you can no longer smell the atmosphere of imperialism. What is moving and audible is the fishing songs on the sea.

    北宁线上
    勇进
    平静的列车
    二十五日记者搭“前进号”列车沿北宁线东北行。当你一踏进车站的时候，会使你上车时的紧张心情平静下来，嘈杂混乱的景象已属过去的时代了。
    列车上两个青年的服务生兴奋地叙述着列车上的过去与现在，谈到他们的工作时似乎是更加兴奋了些：“现在在作工作上级看见了，谁做不好了大家互相提意见，作好了受表扬。”你可以明显的知道解放不久的工人，他们已开始掌握了批评与自我批评的武器。在你的脚下清洁的地板上，没有肮脏的东西，我问他们扫地的次数，他们说：什么时候脏了什么时候扫。他们马上记起了过去为扫地而受过的骂与打，国民党及有钱的人们大便时手纸还得给他们拿呢？一个人坐几个人的坐位，如果查他们的票时，你就用脸准备着挨耳光。姓张的服务生引证了三公尺以内的事实：你看那解放军多老实，几个战士当中两个人在瞌睡，两个在学习，还有一个面向着窗子从辘辘车轮声中，间或听出他轻微的歌声，比起他们身边两位姑娘的说话声音要小得多。
    我还与一个东北解放军的战士谈话，他是前年参加东北人民解放军的，家住梨树，现在铁道兵团工作，他参加过吉林之战，他给我谈了东北四平、沈阳、锦州战英雄们辉煌的业之迹。
    从天津到开滦
    过去天津首先映入眼帘的，则是路南沿海的连绵盐堆，象山岗一样，这就是驰名长芦盐产区，盐田近三十万亩。车站上的人告诉我四千多盐警取消了，盐民也得到了自由，五月份的产量比四月增加了一倍还多（五月份近产三百万担）。现在长芦盐可无阻碍的运到察南、冀东、冀南、冀鲁豫、正太线、豫北平汉线等地。在这一带地区你看不到青绿的田禾，只是一望无垠的盐滩，盐工与盐民正在劳作，或将盐从小水沟里运往大盐场，风车在转动，有名的黄花鱼就在这一带出产。
    火车至滦河时，车上的人们自然的从车窗里伸出头来，赞美着滦河大铁桥的修复，在桥上车行得较慢些，长达六百五十米的滦河大铁桥，一百五十米的饮马河铁桥等大小一百十五座桥梁，大都为国民党破坏，滦河大铁桥被敌人破坏六处，当林彪将军的大军涌进关内的时候，北宁线很快的在一月二十日通了车。
    火车还离开滦煤矿很远的时候，煤堆就可以看见了。解放后的开滦煤矿工人，生产量逐日提高着，超过三年来产煤的标准，由每日二千三百吨增至一万二千吨。东行至开滦煤矿时，工人们成群的从煤井里走出来，洋溢着劳动后的欢乐，唱着歌走回自己的家中。
    你计算着不到半点钟或一二十分钟内，总会有车对开过去源源的大批的枕木、铁轨、食粮，从丰饶的东北运进关内来，支援前线与帮助关内建设，在这道线上最容易使你想到新民主主义建设的光明的将来。
    丰收的象征
    唐山以东直至秦皇岛，这一带数百里的地区，高粮最多，很符合农民的：“麦子去了头，高粮满过牛”的农谚。今年，遵化、玉田、迁安、抚宁、芦龙、昌黎、滦县的麦收每亩合百余斤。高粮自唐山以东绿得象海水一样。这一线红薯最多，红薯秧已经一二尺长了，这里没有旱象也看不到虫的灾害，当然坐火车比“走马观花”更差一些。另外棉花也很多，在秦皇岛以东附近地区花生也不少，不管是什么庄稼的行列总是那样的整齐，行列中的草是很少的。
    草最多而且是非常茂盛的是铁路两旁的洼地（铁路两边十几米内没有庄稼），牧群正在孩子们的牧鞭下走动着，牧童们的歌声被列车的响声淹没了。
    一个家是昌黎的乘客，他告诉了我不少李运昌将军在这里与敌人打游击战的故事。昌黎县凤凰山的山腰下尽是丛密的果林，这里出产苹果、杏、葡萄、梨，每个村庄都深陷在稠密的林丛中，使人遗憾的是国民党匪帮在这里将果木树砍去很多。
    自由的渤海滨
    列车穿过田野与村庄，过了避暑胜地北戴河，秦皇岛向我们奔来。
    我们沿着秦皇岛的一条唯一的石灰长路走向海滨，开滦的煤正准备出口。使人感到最兴奋愉快的是这海面亦属人民自己的海面了。工人们、学生们在海滨放下了鱼竿，在不长的时间内会从海里拉出了海兔子（即乌贼）或成斤的大鱼来。他们告诉我，在过去，别说在这里钓鱼的话啦，在站一站也会遭到恐吓与打骂的。
    从马头到北戴河避暑地，这带的海水是平静的，渔船可以自由捕鱼，再也没有强横的军队在这里将鱼拿去而不给钱。渔人有趣的告诉我：“解放军有时帮助捉鱼捉半天，他走时给他鱼也不要，叫他吃饭也不吃。”渤海滨停留着的几只轮船上高高飘扬着红旗，在码头的外面波涛起伏，渔船出没在海浪里，在人民的渤海之滨，你再也闻不见帝国主义的气息，动人听闻的是海面的渔家歌声。
