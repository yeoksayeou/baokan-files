　　From Among the Soldiers, To Among the Soldiers.
    —— After Seeing "Going to the Battlefield," "Zhao Xilai's Celebration of Merit," and "Fair Trade"
    Yushan
    The 67th Army Frontline Cultural Troupe may not be well-known to many people in Beiping, but within the 20th Army Corps and other army units, it is warmly welcomed and known to the majority of commanders and fighters. This is the result of their deep involvement in the companies, living with the soldiers, and using the weapon of art and literature to faithfully serve the troops.
    From the three short plays "Going to the Battlefield," "Zhao Xilai's Celebration of Merit," and "Fair Trade," their achievements in serving the troops are clearly demonstrated. Serving the troops, as referred to here, should have two aspects: one is to directly help the companies carry out the "soldiers performing for soldiers" movement, and the other is for the cultural troupe to perform for the soldiers. A good combination of these two can achieve the task of popularization and improvement, going from the soldiers to the soldiers. There is no doubt that the Frontline Cultural Troupe has done this very well.
    We see "Fair Trade," which is adapted from a script written by the soldiers themselves in "soldiers performing for soldiers," while "Going to the Battlefield" and "Zhao Xilai's Celebration of Merit" are also written based on the content and forms that soldiers like to see and hear, extracted from the "soldiers performing for soldiers" creations. This is why these three short and concise plays have been welcomed by the majority of commanders and fighters.
    In terms of content, these three plays closely grasp the central idea of the troops at that time. "Fair Trade" educates the soldiers that in the new areas, it is even more important to implement the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" to protect and promote the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army. "Going to the Battlefield" explains how liberated soldiers pour out their grievances and change their minds, as well as the strong fighting will of the People's Liberation Army. "Zhao Xilai's Celebration of Merit" reflects how the merit-making movement in the troops effectively stimulated the enthusiasm, initiative, and class consciousness of the soldiers, and transformed backward elements in the movement. These themes are very sharp because they powerfully enlightened the class consciousness of the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, encouraged the commanders and fighters to promote the spirit of new heroism, and thus directly and concretely solved the ideological problems existing in the troops, and helped the political work of the troops. Therefore, the Frontline Cultural Troupe has been valued by the Party and leaders of the troops. For example, the issue of liberated soldiers. Since our army has been winning victories, the proportion of liberated soldiers has increased (some companies account for 80 percent, and generally account for about half). Making these liberated soldiers recognize the deception and concealment of the Chiang bandits, and understand that they are fighting for the people and for their own liberation, is very important work to enlighten their class consciousness. In "Going to the Battlefield," we can see that this problem has been solved (the other two plays will not be cited as examples). As such, these plays have a strong guiding role and a great influence.
    In terms of form, these three plays are short and concise, with simple sets, very combat-oriented, so not only can the drama club perform them, but the soldiers themselves can also perform them. They are fresh, lively, exciting, and encouraging, with some rare expressions, such as the yangko team doing somersaults and performing with bears on the spot in the last scene of "Zhao Xilai's Celebration of Merit." This is obviously something that comes from the soldiers, and these things are bound to be welcomed by the soldiers. Secondly, combat actions are dance-ized and sung and danced simultaneously, such as the actions of sharpening knives, wiping guns, and blasting in "Going to the Battlefield," and the scenes of transporting explosives, bayonet fighting, and charging in "Zhao Xilai's Celebration of Merit." This is a form of military song and dance developed successfully from the peasant yangko dance, suitable for expressing soldiers. It is very novel and creative.
    All three plays have rich troop life, which makes the plays on stage have images and flesh and blood, and shows the characteristics of the People's Liberation Army, which is also a major reason for their success.
    Here, Chairman Mao's policy of popularization and improvement is clearly practiced. Because the comrades of the Frontline Cultural Troupe went deep into the companies to help carry out the "soldiers performing for soldiers" movement and did a good job of this popularization work honestly, they were able to know what the soldiers liked to see and hear? Following the direction of the soldiers, according to the soldiers' level, they absorbed the essence of the soldiers' works, refined and improved them. According to comrades who helped with "soldiers performing for soldiers," the soldiers' own creations are very rich, and their methods of expressing life and solving problems, as well as the forms they use, are unique and cannot be imagined by our literary and art workers. This is our inexhaustible source, and the life that has been processed by the soldiers, becoming an art in its embryonic state, is more convenient for writers and actors to further process and improve. From the performances of the Frontline Cultural Troupe, we once again vividly and concretely recognized the relationship between popularization and improvement, proving the correctness of Chairman Mao's literary and art policy. If you want to do a good job of improvement, you must first do a good job of popularization. This truth is unchangeable.
    The actors can also vividly express the characters of the soldiers, especially Wang Hai in "Going to the Battlefield," who plays the role of a soldier very well and shows Wang Hai's character. He, like the squad leader, Zhao Xilai, etc., also performed well. The two old men performed quite successfully, especially Zhao Xilai's father, who was emotionally rich, natural, and concise in his actions, accurately expressing the character of the character without exaggeration.
    It should also be mentioned that the performance style of the Frontline Cultural Troupe is very good. The reporter said during the report: "Fair Trade" is 25 minutes, "Going to the Battlefield" is 48 minutes, and "Zhao Xilai's Celebration of Merit" is 70 minutes. The result of the performance is almost the same, and some even ended early. People who are used to living in the city may not feel anything great, but in the army, this is very important because the army is often very nervous in training, fighting, and marching. The drama club's performance activities should adapt to this tense and combat environment. At the same time, everything in the army also requires accuracy, and this style becomes very valuable.
    Finally, I would like to briefly raise two points. First of all, I think these three plays are very good with their joy and encouragement and sharp themes, but the ideological depth is still insufficient. Here, I am referring to the explanation and problem-solving are not deep enough, and they have not grasped the most essential aspect of the problem more closely. For example, Wang Hai in "Going to the Battlefield" only shows how active he is, but does not feel the reason why he is so active (it is said in the dialogue, but the impression is not deep). "Zhao Xilai's Celebration of Merit" only shows the enthusiastic scene of Zhao Xilai's current merit, but does not reveal how he made the merit, making people not feel the greatness of his hero. It may be too harsh to require this of such a short play! But I want to raise it only to hope that the comrades of the Frontline Cultural Troupe can make further progress and pay attention to this issue in the future so as to create more successful works. Secondly, since many things are absorbed from "soldiers performing for soldiers," some places feel that the forms are not unified, and some things are not harmonious when put inside, such as the somersaults and bear performances in the last scene of "Zhao Xilai's Celebration of Merit." Can this be further processed! It is raised for research, and the opinion may not be correct. Finally, I hope that the actors of the Frontline Cultural Troupe will pay attention to cherish their voices, and the sandy saliva of singing and speaking will somewhat affect the performance effect of the play.

　　从战士中来，到战士中去。
    ——“上战场”，“赵喜来庆功”，“买卖公平”观后
    羽山
    六十七军战线文工团，在北平的许多人也许还不太知道它，但在二十兵团和别的兵团部队中，它却是个为广大指战员所热烈欢迎和熟知的。这是由于他们深入连队，和战士生活在一起，而又以文艺的武器忠诚地为兵服务的结果。
    从“上战场”，“赵喜来庆功”，“买卖公平”，这三个短小的戏里，已经很确切地显示出他们为兵服务的成绩。这里所指的为兵服务，应该有两方面：一方面是直接帮助连队开展“兵演兵”的运动，一方面是文工团演戏给兵看。很好把这两者结合起来，就能做到从战士中来到战士中去的普及而又提高的任务。毫无疑问，这一点，战线文工团是做得很不错的。
    我们看到“买卖公平”，这就是根据“兵演兵”里，兵自己写的剧本来改编的，而“上战场”和“赵喜来庆功”，也是根据“兵演兵”创作中，提炼出的为兵所喜闻乐见的内容和形式写出来的，所以使得这三个短小精悍的戏，能够得到广大指战员的欢迎。
    在内容上，这三个戏都紧紧把握住部队当时的中心思想，“买卖公平”是教育战士在新区，更要很好地执行“三大纪律、八项注意”，以保护和发扬人民解放军的光荣传统。“上战场”说明了解放战士如何诉苦翻心，以及解放军坚强的战斗意志。“赵喜来庆功”反映部队立功运动，如何有效地发挥了战士的热情积极和阶级觉悟，并在运动中改造了落后分子。这些主题都是很尖锐的。因为它们都有力的启发了人民解放军指战员的阶级觉悟，鼓励着指战员发扬新英雄主义的思想，这样就直接而具体的解决了部队中存在的思想问题，帮助了部队政治工作，因之战线文工团也就被部队党和首长所重视了。比如解放战士的问题，自从我军节节胜利，解放战士的成份增多（有的连队占百分之八十，一般都占一半左右），使这批解放战士认清蒋匪的欺骗蒙蔽，了解自己为人民作战，也为了自己的解放，这种启发他们阶级觉悟的工作，就非常重要。在“上战场”中，我们可以看到这个问题被解决了（另外两个戏不再举例）。如此，这些戏的指导性就很强，影响就很大。
    在形式上，这三个戏都短小精悍，布景简单，非常战斗化，不仅剧社可以演，战士们自己也能演。新鲜，活泼，兴奋鼓舞，里边有一些少见的表现手法，如“赵喜来庆功”最后一场，秧歌队当场翻筋斗，耍狗熊等，这很明显是从战士中来的东西，这些东西是一定为战士喜见乐闻的。其次把战斗动作舞蹈化和且歌且舞，如“上战场”中磨刺刀，擦枪，爆破的动作，“赵喜来庆功”中运炸药，刺杀，冲锋等场面，这是一种由农民的秧歌舞蹈发展成功的，适合表现战士的部队歌舞形式。很新颖和有创造性。
    三个戏里，都有着很充实的部队生活，使台上的戏有形象，有血肉，表现出了人民解放军的特色，这也是成功的一大原因。
    这里很明显地实践了毛主席的普及和提高的方针。由于战线文工团的同志们，深入连队帮助开展了“兵演兵”运动，很老实地做好了这一普及工作，所以他们就能够知道战士们喜闻乐见的是什么？就沿着兵的方向，根据兵的水准，吸取了兵的作品中的精华，加以洗炼和提高。据帮助过“兵演兵”的同志说，战士们自己的创作是非常丰富的，他们表现生活和解决问题的方法，以及使用的形式都独具特点，不是我们文艺工作者所能想象得出来的。这就是我们取之不尽，用之不竭的源泉，而且经过战士们加工过的生活，成为萌芽状态的艺术，是更便利于作家和演员的进一步加工提高的。从战线文工团的演出中，使我们又一次生动而具体地认识了普及和提高的关系，证明毛主席文艺方针的正确。要想把提高工作做好，首先要把普及工作做好，这个真理是不可改变的。
    演员们也都能很生动的表演出战士的性格，特别是“上战场”里的王海，演的真是战士味十足，而且表现出王海的性格。他如班长，赵喜来等也演的不坏，两个老头儿演的相当成功，特别是赵喜来的爹，感情丰富，自然，动作简练，确切，毫不夸大的表现出了人物的性格。
    还应当提起的是：战线文工团的演出作风非常好，报告员报告时说：“买卖公平”二十五分钟，“上战场”四十八分钟，“赵喜来庆功”七十分钟，演出的结果几乎一点不差，有的还提前结束了。在城市里住惯的人，也许感觉不出有什么了不起，但在部队里，这却很重要，因为部队经常在练兵，打仗，行军中很紧张，剧社演出活动应当适应这种紧张、战斗的环境。同时部队一切事情也都要求准确，这种作风就成为很可贵的。
    最后，我想简单的提出两个意见，首先我觉得这三个戏欢欣鼓舞，主题尖锐很好，但思想深度尚嫌不足，这里我指的是说明性和解决问题还不够深刻，还没有更紧的掌握住问题的最本质的那面，比如“上战场”里的王海，只表现了他如何积极，但感不到他为什么会这样积极的道理（对话里说了，但印象不深的），“赵喜来庆功”，只看出赵喜来现在立了功的热烈场面，而没有透露他怎么立的功，使人感觉不出他功臣的伟大劲来。在人物的刻划上多少显的不全面，典型性差，对这样的短剧如此要求，也许过苛了吧！但我要提出来只是希望战线文工团的同志们，能百尺竿头更进一步，今后能注意这一问题，以便创作出更成功的作品。其次，由于许多东西从“兵演兵”中吸取来的，有的地方感到形式不统一，有的东西放到里边不调和，如“赵喜来庆功”最后一场，翻筋斗，耍狗熊。这是不是可以进一步加工呢！提出来做为研究，意见不一定正确。末了希望战线文工团的演员们，注意爱惜自己的嗓子，唱和说话声音的沙唾，是多少影响戏的演出效果的吧。
