　　Yakolev's Learning Spirit
  　Excerpts from Study Notes
    Pei Xuan
    The spirit of learning and the methods of learning directly determine the results of learning. I have gained some insights into this issue from the book "Notes of a Soviet Aircraft Designer" by Yakolev, a famous Soviet aircraft designer. In this book, we can see how he immersed himself in diligent study in real life, and how he became a famous aircraft designer under the nurturing of a rational Soviet system.
    Yakolev's excellent learning methods demonstrated his high degree of diligence. He not only spent nights reading various books extensively, but also tirelessly used the method of combining theory and practice to delve into problems.
    Although Yakolev was a technical science doctor specializing in aircraft construction, he had read many books about travel and adventure in his youth. He had read almost all the works of many famous fairy tale writers, and also read many biographies of celebrities and books about history and art. These books seemed to have little to do with him becoming an aircraft designer, but he said in his autobiography: "Books have cultivated my love for technology, books have taught me ideals and fantasies, taught me to strive for a goal, taught me to love and respect labor, and finally, books have developed my general knowledge and broadened my horizons. Only a comprehensively developed person can become a good engineer and designer. Those who are concerned with small things, who only know the slide rule and certain formulas necessary for their daily work, cannot create anything valuable or interesting." It can be seen that the breadth and depth of knowledge determine the size of the scope of thought. Only after expanding the scope of thought can one appreciate the internal connections between many things and consider problems from more aspects. This method of reading extensively is indispensable in our studies. Of course, this is not "dabbling in everything." We should specialize in one industry and carry out professional learning with focus, planning, and steps in the process of obtaining necessary knowledge, but at the same time, we should also plan to read various books to enrich our knowledge.
    Yakolev found his specialized direction in extensive reading. From wanting to be Robinson Crusoe, the hero Tom Sawyer, wanting to be a railway engineer, a radio engineer, he finally found the aircraft construction work that was most suitable for him.
    He not only read many books on specialized subjects and other aspects of knowledge, but also often ran to factories to practice and observe on the spot. He had made many toys, such as small boats and small trains, and also made a glider that could take off. Not only that, before entering aviation school, when he was about twenty-one or two years old, he had already made an excellent two-seater aircraft with the help of the Soviets! When he was trial-producing gliders and airplanes, he not only spent a lot of time reading many specialized books, such as air, mechanics, etc., but also often went to factories to observe the construction of various airplanes. He spent a lot of time in a place full of broken airplanes to observe those broken parts, study the nature of the damage, think about the causes of the damage, and the weaknesses of the aircraft. This self-study perseverance and the method of learning in practical work are truly worthy of our special imitation.
    It is a great honor that the bright liberated areas and the rational new society allow and help us to exert our strength. We should have Yakolev's spirit of learning, and we should not be afraid of difficulties or troubles to find our specialized direction from "extensive reading," and use the learning method of "thinking more and doing more" to carry out our careers.

　　雅可福烈夫的学习精神
  　读书笔记片断
    沛旋
    学习的精神与学习的方法，是直接决定着学习的成果的。我从苏联著名的飞机构造家雅可福烈夫的“一个苏联飞机构造家的自述”一书中得到了关于这一问题的一些启示。在这本书中我们可以看到他是如何地在现实生活中埋头苦学，又如何地在合理的苏维埃制度的养育下成为著名的飞机构造家。
    雅可福烈夫优良的学习方法表现了他高度的苦学精神，他不仅彻夜地广读着各种书籍，而且还以永不疲倦的精神用理论与实践相结合的方法去钻研问题。
    雅可福烈夫虽是一个专攻飞机构造的技术科学博士，但他在少年时代却是涉猎了许多关于旅行的及冒险事业的书籍，他几乎读遍了许多有名的童话故事作家的全部著作，而且还读了许多名人传记及关于历史的、艺术的书籍，这些书籍对于他成为一个飞机构造家，似乎关系不大，但他在自述中却这样说道：“书籍使我养成了嗜好技术，书籍教会我理想、幻想。教我努力于一种目标，教我爱好尊重劳动，最后，书籍发展了我的一般知识，扩大了我的眼界。只有全面发展的人才能成为一个好的工程师，构造家。凡竞竞于细小事情的人，只知道自己日常工作所必需的计算尺和一定的公式，却不能创造任何有价值和有趣味的东西。”由此可见知识的浅与博，决定着思想范围的大小，只有在扩展了思想的范围之后，才会体会到许多事务之间的与内在的联系，才能更多方面的去考虑问题。这种博览群书的学习方法，在我们学习中是不可缺少的，当然这并不是“事事都沾一手”，我们应该专事一业，在取得必需知识的过程中要有重心有计划有步骤地去进行专业学习，但同时还要有计划地阅读各种书籍来丰富我们的知识。
    雅可福烈夫在博览中找到了自己专攻的方向。从想当鲁滨逊、英雄托马索耶尔，想做铁路工程师，无线电工程师，一直找到了最适于他的飞机构造工作。
    他不仅读了许多专门学科的及其他各方面知识的书籍，而且还常常跑到工厂中去实地练习和观察。他曾制造了许多玩具，小轮船小火车之类的东西，还制过一架能够起飞的滑翔机。不仅如此，他在进入航空学校学习之前，大约是二十一、二岁的时候吧，就已然在苏维埃的帮助之下制成了一架优良的双人飞机了！在他试制滑翔机和飞机的时候，他不单花费了许多时间阅读了许多专门学科的书籍，如空气、力学等等，而且常到工厂中去观察各种飞机的构造，他曾在一个堆满破碎飞机的地方用了很多时间去观察那些破碎的机件，研究了破坏的性质，思索了破坏的原因，以及该机的弱点。这种自学的毅力和在实际工作中学习的方法，真是值得我们特别提出效法的。
    很荣幸，光明的解放区，合理的新社会是允许而且帮助我们发挥自己的力量的，我们应具有雅可福烈夫的学习精神，要不怕困难不怕麻烦地从“博览”中找出自己的专攻方向，并用“多想多作”的学习方法去进行我们的事业。
