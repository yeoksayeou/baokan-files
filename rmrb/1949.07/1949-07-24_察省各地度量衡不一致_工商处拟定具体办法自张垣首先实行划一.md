　　【Chahar News】The weights and measures used in various parts of Chahar Province are extremely inconsistent, causing great inconvenience in daily transactions among the people. This has led some unscrupulous merchants to engage in speculation and trickery, buying with large scales and selling with small scales, using large dippers to buy and small dippers to sell, increasing extra exploitation and affecting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In view of this, the Industry and Commerce Department of the Chahar Provincial People's Government has decided to start with Zhangjiakou this month to carry out standardization work, and then gradually promote it after gaining experience. The steps are as follows: (1) Conduct investigation and registration of existing weights and measures manufacturing, repair, and sales businesses in Zhangjiakou, and order them to apply for business license before they can operate. (2) Those who manufacture and repair illegally will be banned. (3) The finished products of the manufacturing plant must be legally inspected before being sold, and can only be sold after being stamped with the qualified mark "ㄎ". (4) In order to ensure the accuracy of weights and measures during use, all users can apply for inspection at any time, and it is planned to hold inspections on a regular basis. (5) Conduct spot checks on major industries in Zhangjiakou, such as grain, flour shops, meat, oil, wine, and coal industries.

　　察省各地度量衡不一致
    工商处拟定具体办法自张垣首先实行划一
    【察哈尔讯】察省各地所使用之度量衡器极不一致，在民间日常交易上极感不便，致一些奸商投机取巧，大秤买小秤卖，大斗来小斗去，加重额外剥削，影响城乡物资交流，察省人民政府工商处有鉴及此，决定于本月份起，首由张市着手进行划一工作，吸取经验再逐步推广。其步骤如下：（１）对张市现有度量衡制造厂修理、贩卖业进行调查登记，并令其办理申请营业许可执照，始可营业。（２）对不合法的制造与修理者予以取缔。（３）制造厂之成品在出售前必须经过合法之检定，合格后盖有合格标记“ㄎ”字者，始可出售。（４）为了保证度量衡器在使用期间之准确性，所有使用户，可随时申请检定，并拟按期举行检查。（５）对张市主要行业，如粮、面斗局、肉、油、酒、煤等业进行抽查。
