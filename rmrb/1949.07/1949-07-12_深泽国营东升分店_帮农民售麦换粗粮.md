Jizhong Electric: In Shenze County, a disaster area last year due to flooding, the autumn harvest was poor, and the masses lacked coarse grains. This year's wheat harvest is relatively good, and most people are eager to sell their wheat to buy coarse grains for food. In this situation, speculative merchants took the opportunity to vigorously depress wheat prices and raise coarse grain prices. In particular, millet rose from 780 yuan per dou to 900 yuan per dou; in some small markets, wheat was only 650 yuan per dou, while millet rose to 1,000 yuan per dou. To protect the interests of the masses and solve their difficulties in selling wheat and buying coarse grains, the state-owned Dongsheng Branch specially transferred a large quantity of coarse grains (millet, sorghum, etc.) from distant places. Combined with the county's promotion of cooperatives, through disaster area branches and village cadres, it organized the masses by village to exchange grain at the store. Cooperative members who were introduced by the district branches to exchange coarse grains at the store were supplied at 3% below the market price, and the members' wheat was purchased at 2% above the market price. For the masses who were temporarily organized after propaganda and education by district and village cadres, coarse grains were supplied at 2% below the market price, and wheat was purchased at 1% above the market price. At the same time, to solve the difficulties of the general public lacking coarse grains, equivalent exchanges were carried out with the masses in the market at market prices. From the time the new wheat came on the market on June 10 to June 18, the state-owned Dongsheng Branch exchanged and purchased a total of 200,768 jin of wheat with coarse grains, and paid out a total of 167,947 jin of coarse grains. In this way, a reasonable difference between wheat and coarse grains was appropriately controlled, stabilizing prices and打击打击投机奸商. Now coarse grain prices have begun to fall back. In addition: The state-owned Longchang General Store, in order to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage for farmers in villages near Baiyang Lake, has transferred a large amount of fertilizer bone meal from Botou. In the last two months alone, more than 128,000 jin have been transferred and sold to farmers in villages near Baiyang Lake at a price one-third lower than the market price, solving the fertilizer shortage problem for more than 40 villages such as Macun and Duancun for planting late rice and vegetable gardens.

　　深泽国营东升分店
  　帮农民售麦换粗粮
    【冀中电】深泽县去年的水灾地区，因大秋歉收，群众缺乏粗粮，今年麦收较好，一般群众多急于出售小麦换回粗粮食用。在此情况下，投机奸商便乘机大力压低麦价抬高粗粮价格，特别是小米由原来七百八十元一斗涨到九百元一斗；有些小的集市小麦每斗价格只六百五十元，而小米每斗则涨到一千元。国营东升分店为维护群众利益，解决群众售麦换回粗粮的困难，特从远地调运来了大批粗粮（小米红粮等），结合县推进社，通过水灾区分社和村干部以村为单位，组织群众统一到商店交换。合作社员经区分社介绍统一到商店交换粗粮者，低于市价百分之三供给；社员之小麦则高于市价百分之二吸收。对经过区村干部宣传教育后，临时组织起来的群众，粗粮低于市价百分之二供给；小麦则高于市价百分之一吸收。同时为了解决一般群众缺乏粗粮困难，并在市场上按照市场价格与群众进行了等价交换。自六月十日新麦上市以来到六月十八日止，国营东升分店用粗粮和群众交换与购入小麦共二十万零七百六十八斤，付出粗粮共十六万七千九百四十七斤。这样一来，适当掌握了小麦与粗粮间的合理差额，稳定了物价，打击了投机奸商。现在粗粮价格已开始回落。又讯：国营隆昌总店为解决白洋淀附近村庄农民缺乏肥料的困难，特从泊头调运了大批肥田骨粉。只最近两月来就调运了十二万八千余斤，以低于市价三分之一的价格出售给白洋淀附近村庄农民，解决了马村端村等四十多个村庄农民播种晚田及菜园等缺肥困难。
