　　On the Themes and Work Base of Films in the Coming Period
    Shi Dongshan
    First of all, I want to explain: In the past, among our friends, there were different opinions on the methodological question of whether a script should first have a theme or a character. This should be carefully studied separately, but before I raise the question of "on the themes and work base of films in the coming period," I must first discuss the question of "is it right to have a theme first when creating a script?"

    I think: not in ordinary times, but in a time like now, when we often need to deal with the current reality and use literature and art as a weapon to conduct various sharp struggles, then the practice of many comrades in rural areas or the army -- whatever problem occurs in the village (or army), perform a play about it -- is the correct way to use the weapons they have mastered. Originally, in the creative process, the discovery of theme and character is not absolutely separate. When you discover a problem in society and then want to use it as a theme in literature and art, you may have already seen or heard descriptions of the behavior and appearance of several characters, or even some scenes. Or, after discovering a problem, you go to the field to observe and interview some characters and scenes. In short, the theme in literature and art is not some problem or theme in theoretical books. It must be accompanied by characters and scenes that you are familiar with, or can imagine, or can easily observe and interview. Originally, there is not much distance between the two methods, and I think that in drama and film work, the former is more convenient to cooperate with the work plan. Therefore, I think: the way I am now raising the question of "on the themes and work base of films in the coming period" is acceptable.

    Today, many comrades believe that under the current situation, especially under the work policy of cities leading the countryside, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art should not only be for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but also should choose all subjects from the standpoint of the workers, peasants, and soldiers for the benefit of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. I think this understanding is correct and in line with the current reality. First of all, we can estimate that in the future, big cities will be the most acute and complex places for various political, economic, and cultural struggles. In the future, we will see many events or phenomena that are unfavorable to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and even very serious events or phenomena will occur. All kinds of ghosts and monsters and vicious conspiracies will appear, requiring us to expose them in a timely manner. There must be all kinds of ugly and sinister skills and faces that we need to show to the masses, so that everyone understands and is vigilant. Secondly, at the current stage, we must also often hold up a mirror for the broad petty bourgeoisie, the general intellectuals, the young students, and even the national bourgeoisie, to see if many people still have some old shadows, or sometimes show them, or even many people's old shadows have not moved much at all, and they urgently need to be vigilant, or be urged and encouraged, so as to quickly transform themselves. In addition, there is no harm in writing about the praise and advocacy of internationalism and the world peace movement, and even some historical themes. In short, in the future, in addition to first writing about the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we should also write about everything else for the benefit of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The reason is that the scope of the current situation that is related to the interests of the workers, peasants, and soldiers has expanded and become more complex than before. This is our new task of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In this new task, the face of literature and art will be broad, and the roles participating in the struggle will be the workers, peasants, and soldiers themselves, or their vanguards, or their allies. This kind of thing has happened in the past, and it will definitely happen more in the future. Based on the above-mentioned situations that will inevitably occur in the future, if we insist on saying: "In the future, for classes other than the workers, peasants, and soldiers, just show them things that reflect the lives of the workers, peasants, and soldiers," then it is undoubtedly not enough. We should also encourage and praise the allies who participate in the struggle for the benefit of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We should also give "prescriptive" criticism and education to those who are stubborn and unrepentant. And we must expose or show in a timely manner the various conspiracies of the remnants of reactionary forces and the skills and faces that appear by using various postures, so that the masses can understand and recognize them. This situation will inevitably come, and we must be prepared.

    Speaking of big cities, we naturally first think of Shanghai, the sixth largest city in the world and the largest city in China. Shanghai has a population of six million, and has been ruled by imperialists for a long time, especially the place where the culture of the British and American bourgeoisie has been most deeply infected. It is the place where the Kuomintang has spent the most effort in ruling. It has always been a famous den of sin, and was once the paradise of world adventurers. It must be a big city that deserves the most attention in the future.

    Shanghai is also the place with the most factories and workers. Just in terms of light industry, it accounts for more than 50% of the entire China. There are no accurate statistics on other non-industrial workers and free laborers, but we know that the number must be very large. The workers in the South, their temperament, living habits, living interests, and even their living requirements are not exactly the same as those of the workers in the North. They must also need artistic works, especially movies, that make them feel close (Shanghai workers have the habit of watching movies).

    As for the rural environment and farmers' lives in the Jiangnan area, they are also not exactly the same as those in the North. In particular, the steps and process of the land reform in the new Jiangnan area in the future are also different from those in the old areas. We must pay attention to the problems that will occur there at any time. In terms of film work, we must also take Shanghai as the base.

    Shanghai is also the place with the most film studios, film workers, and film production, but the personnel are also the most complex, and the products are also the most complex. There are many film practitioners who retain old habits, but they are quite skilled in technology. Now we need to organize them, influence them, and make them friends who have both skilled technology and good style and correct thinking, so that they can sincerely serve the people.

    Many comrades believe that the film work base in Shanghai is something that must be given great attention. In the future, more diverse, rich, and moving works may be produced there, and more fresh troops are needed there to cope.

    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    In addition, the work of the Cantonese-speaking areas and the millions of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia must also be taken care of in a timely manner. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionary government banned Cantonese films under the pretext of unifying the national language, which was a self-defeating approach; overseas Chinese are the ones who need the most concern and warmth from their motherland. We should also prepare for films for ethnic minorities in regions such as Mongolia and Xinjiang. In the future, our photography studios need to have ethnic minority literary and art workers to learn or work together.

    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    Film work is the same as other practical work. Although the overall plan is in the Central Government, the focus of practical work is not necessarily just one. There can only be one administrative center, but there can be several focuses of practical work. Although there should be a distinction between priority and urgency, it is natural, but how slow is slow, and how light is light, must be accurately grasped.

    In terms of the work environment: Shanghai has more than 30 years of film production history. There are already many subordinate organizations and institutions surrounding this enterprise, such as a temporary actor introduction agency, which can solve the problem of hundreds of mass actors of various classes, men, women, old and young, for you in a few hours. These masses are not as easy to organize as in rural areas or the army. In cities, there must be a professional specialized agency, and this specialized agency can only exist in a group of or very large-scale film enterprises, and it has its certain local and historical conditions. In the past, the Beijing Film Studio often greatly affected the results of its products because it could not solve the problem of mass actors. In addition, the convenience of repairing various parts, and purchasing raw materials and parts, etc., also have local and historical relationships, which cannot be obtained in other places in the short term. For the convenience of work, in order to cope with our current urgent political tasks, I think this is also an issue that should be considered.

    As for the income of Chinese film distribution in the past, half depended on Southeast Asia and half depended on the domestic market, and almost half of the domestic market depended on Shanghai. Now that the Northeast is unified, the above ratio may change, but in the short term, this change will not be too great. Whether this economic issue should be regarded as one of the conditions for us to consider future film work may be a minor matter.

### 关于今后一个时期内电影的主题和工作的据点

　　关于今后一个时期内电影的主题和工作的据点
    史东山
    首先，我要说明：过去在我们朋友间对于创作剧本应该先有主题还是先有人物这一方法问题有着不同的意见，这是应该另行加以细密研讨的，但在我现在要提的“关于今后一个时期内电影的主题和工作的据点”这一问题之前是不能不先把“创作剧本先有主题是否对”的问题来说起一下。
    我以为：不在平时，而在现在这样经常需要我们应付当前现实情势，利用文艺这一武器来作各种尖锐斗争的时期，那么有许多同志在农村或军队中的那种作法——村庄上（或部队中）发生了什么问题，演它一个戏——把自己所掌握的武器这样的运用，是正确的。原来，在创作过程中，主题和人物的发现，不是绝对分开的。你在社会上发现了一个问题，进而想把它用为文艺上底主题的时候，你或者同时就已经见到了或听到人家描绘了几个人物的行为和面貌，以至若干场面，或者，你在发现了一个问题之后，又去实地观察访问了若干人物和场面。总之，文艺上所说的主题，不是理论书本上的什么问题或主题，它必然附带着你所熟悉的，或可以想象得到的，或容易观察访问得到的人物和场面。原来两种方法之间没有太大的距离，而且我觉得在戏剧电影工作上，前者比较便于配合工作的计划，所以我想：我现在要提的“关于今后一个时期内电影的主题和工作的据点”，问题这样的提法是可以的。
    今天有很多同志认为：在今天这样的情势之下，特别在城市领导乡村这工作方针之下，文艺为工农兵服务，应该不只是为工农兵，而也应该站在工农兵的立场上，为工农兵的利益选择一切题材来写。这样的理解，我想是正确的，合乎当前现实情势的。首先我们可以估计到今后的大城市是我们政治经济文化各种斗争最尖锐最复杂的地方，今后在那里，我们会看见许多于工农兵不利的事件或现象，甚至很严重的事件或现象发生，有各式各样的鬼怪恶毒的阴谋会出现，需要我们及时加以揭破，其中必然有各式各样丑恶阴险的身手和嘴脸需要我们表现给群众看，使大家明白，以资警惕。其次，在目前这阶段，我们对于广大的小资产阶级，一般知识分子，青年学生，以至民族资产阶级也得常常拿面镜子给大家照照，是不是有许多人的旧影子选存在着一些，或者有时会显露出来，甚至有许多人的旧影子根本还没有动过多少，急待自己警惕，或加以督促勉励，而资其迅速改造。其他，如国际主义世界和平运动的歌颂和鼓吹，以至有些历史的题材，也无妨一写。总之，今后除了首先应该写工农兵之外，也应该为了工农兵的利益去写其他一切东西，理由就是今后的情势，与工农兵有利害关系的范围比从前扩大了，并且复杂了。这是我们为工农兵服务的新任务。在这个新任务上的文艺，它行将接触的面既广，而出场斗争的角色或者是工农兵自己，或者是他们的先锋队，或者是他们的同盟军。这种事情，过去有过，今后必定更多。根据上述种种今后必然会发生的情形来看，假如我们坚持说：“今后对于工农兵以外的阶层，就拿反映工农兵生活的东西给他们看就行了”，那无疑是不够的。对于为工农兵的利益而参加斗争的同盟军，我们也应该加以鼓励和表扬，对于那些顽固不化的人，我们也应该予以“对症下药”的批评与教育，而对于那些反动势力残余的种种阴谋及其利用各种姿态而出现的身手嘴脸则必须及时加以揭发或表现出来让群众明白认识。这种情势必然会来，我们不能不有个准备。
    　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    谈到大城市，我们很自然地首先会想到那个世界第六大都市，而为中国第一大都市的上海。上海拥有六百万人口，曾经帝国主义者长时期统治，特别是英美资产阶级文化传染最深的地方，是国民党统治最花功夫的地方，向来是有名的罪恶底渊薮，曾经是世界冒险家的乐园，必然是今后最值得注意的一个大城市。
    上海也是工厂和工人最多的地方，单就轻工业而言，就占全中国百分之五十以上，其他非产业工人和自由劳动者还没有精确的统计，但知道数目一定很大。南方的工人，他们的气质，生活习惯，生活趣味，以至于生活要求跟北方工人不尽相同，他们一定也需要使他们感觉亲切的艺术作品，特别是电影（上海工人有看电影的习惯）。
    至于江南的农村环境和农民生活，也是与北方不尽相同的，特别是今后江南新区土地改革的步骤和过程也与老区不同，我们也就不能不随时注意那里将要发生的问题，而在电影工作上来说，也是要以上海为据点的。
    上海也是电影制片厂，电影工作人，以及电影出品最多的地方，但人事也最复杂，出品也最复杂。有许多留有旧习惯的电影从业员，在技术上倒是相当有几手的，现在需要组织他们，影响他们，使他们成为既有熟练的技术而又有良好作风和正确思想的朋友，以至其能诚心诚意地来为人民服务。
    有好多同人都认为上海这个电影工作据点是不可不着重地加以注意的。今后在那里可能产生比较多样性的，内容也丰富动人的作品，而那里也需要比较多的生力军去应付。
    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    其他，如粤语系统的地区，以及南洋千百万侨胞的工作也不可不及时顾到。过去，国民党反动政府以统一国语为借口禁止粤语电影，是因噎废食的作法；外洋侨胞则是最需要祖国的关切和温暖的。对于蒙古新疆等地域少数民族的电影，也应该准备。我们今后的摄影场里需要有少数民族的文艺工作人来学习或共同工作。
    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    电影工作和其他实际工作一样，总的计划尽管在中央，实际工作的重点并不一定只是一个。行政中心只可以有一个，实际工作的重点是可以有几个的。虽然此中又应有轻重缓急之分，是当然的事，但其缓，缓到什么时候，轻，又轻到什么程度，是必须掌握准确的。
    在工作环境上来说：上海有三十多年电影制作的历史，围绕着这个企业的周围已经有很多从属的组织和机构，如临时演员介绍所，它能够在几小时之内，为你解决几百个各种阶层底男女老少的群众演员问题。这些群众，不象在农村或军队中那么容易组织，在城市中，必需有一个职业化的专门机构，而这专门机构在成了群的或非常大规模的电影企业中才能存在，并且有它一定的地方和历史的条件。过去的北平电影制片厂，常常因为不能解决群众演员问题而大大地影响了出品的成绩。其他，如各种机件的修造，原料和零件的配购等等方便，也都有地方的和历史的关系，不是其他地方在短期内所可得的。为了工作上的便利，以应付我们当前紧迫的政治任务，我想这也是应该加以考虑的问题。
    至于历来中国电影发行的收入，一半靠南洋，一半靠国内，而国内又是几乎一半靠上海。现在东北统一了，上述的比例，容有变化，但在短期内，这变化不会太大。这经济上的问题是否应该作为我们考虑今后电影工作的条件之一，那也许是件次要的事。
