Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 1st: News from New Delhi: India's economic and political situation is deteriorating.

　　India is undergoing a severe economic panic, especially with regard to food. Officials of the Indian Ministry of Food and Agriculture recently admitted at a press conference that India is deeply suffering from severe food shortages. The main reason for India's food shortage is the dominance of the feudal tenancy system. The Indian News Chronicle reports that feudal landlords in the Jodhpur principality, who own 75 percent of all land, have established an extremely brutal and terrifying rule. In many villages, murder, robbery, and forced eviction of tenants from the land have become common occurrences. Compulsory acquisition of grain from farmers at official prices has aroused resistance from farmers everywhere, and the police have brutally suppressed them. When residents of Huwan Village in the Qipuer principality refused to sell grain, the police opened fire on them, killing fifteen villagers. At the same time, food speculation is rampant, and members of the ruling Indian National Congress are also involved in food speculation. The "Lightning" magazine recently revealed that large-scale fraud occurred in a batch of grain shipped from the United States. In the nine thousand tons of grain, the majority was sand and chaff mixed with only a very small amount of grain.
　　
    In the large Indian industrial cities of Bombay and Calcutta, the political situation is becoming increasingly acute. Many armed police have poured into the working-class districts of Bombay, occupying important strategic locations and patrolling the streets. In Calcutta, incidents of police firing on a large scale in city streets are becoming more and more frequent. The "Bharat Jyoti" newspaper reported that Calcutta has implemented strict police rule. The West Bengal government has authorized all police officers, from assistant sub-inspectors down, to arrest people without warrants.

　　印度粮食奇缺　政治情势恶化
    【新华社北平一日电】新德里讯：印度的经济及政治情势益见恶化。
    印度正在经受严重的经济恐慌、尤其是在粮食方面。印度粮食及农业部官员最近在记者招待会上承认：印度深感粮食奇缺之苦，印度粮食奇缺的主要原因，就是封建租佃制度的统治。印度新闻纪事报称，拥有全部土地百分之七十五的约德泊土邦的封建地主们，已建立极其残暴恐怖的统治。在许多村庄里，杀人、抢劫和强制将佃户逐离土地，已成为经常发生的事情。按官定价格强制收购农民的谷物，已在各地激起农民的反抗，而警察则对农民予以残暴的镇压。齐浦尔土邦胡万村居民拒绝出卖谷物时，警察向他们开枪，结果村民十五人被杀。与此同时，粮食投机活动猖獗，执政党印度国大党人也参与粮食投机活动。“闪电”杂志最近还揭露在美国运来的一批谷物中，发生大规模欺诈事件，在九千吨谷物中，大部分是仅仅夹杂极少量谷物的砂石和糠皮。
    在印度工业大城市孟买和加尔各答，政治情势日趋尖锐。孟买工人区内涌进许多武装警察，他们占领重要战略据点，并在街头巡逻。在加尔各答，警察在市区街道上大规模开枪的事件已愈来愈多。“巴拉特·焦狄”报载：加尔各答已施行严格的警察统治。西孟加拉政府已授权自助理警长以下的一切警察，不须拘票即可捕人。
