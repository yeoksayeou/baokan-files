Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th. Shanghai has launched a campaign for thrift in government offices. The Military Control Commission and the People's Municipal Government are taking the lead by switching to communal kitchens for all meals starting on the 12th, stopping the use of elevators, and halting the use of all but three cars needed by leading personnel. The Trade Department and Finance Department of the Military Control Commission's Financial and Economic Takeover Committee, the East China Branch of the People's Bank of China, the Shanghai Branch, the East China Foreign Trade Bureau, the East China Foreign Trade Corporation, and the Jianghai Customs have also successively formulated many regulations for saving water and electricity. The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau is also planning to establish a thrift campaign committee to be responsible for promoting and inspecting the thrift campaign. The Shipping Department of the Financial and Economic Takeover Committee plans to move the small tugboats stranded in the Huangpu River to inland rivers to develop shipping and increase income. This thrift campaign, initiated by the leading organs of Shanghai, has now begun to gradually unfold in various public-owned factories. Shen Guiyuan and other workers in the tarpaulin workshop of the East China Coal Industry Corporation have used waste oilcloth to repair 14 large tarpaulins, saving materials for the public. Employees of the iron workshop of the Shenxin No. 9 Factory have made machine parts from scrap iron.

    军管会市政府以身作则
    沪市展开节约运动
    【新华社上海十九日电】沪市展开机关节约运动。军管会暨人民市政府首先以身作则，已于十二日起将伙食一律改为大灶，停止使用电梯，除首长必要乘用的三辆汽车外，其余全部停用。军管会财经接管委员会贸易处、金融处、人民银行华东区行、上海分行、华东区国外贸易局、华东区国外贸易总公司及江海关等亦相继订出了节约水电的许多规定。上海市财政局并拟成立节约运动委员会，负责推动与检查节约运动。财经接管委员会航运处拟把搁在黄浦江中的小火轮开到内河去发展航运、增加收入。沪市各领导机关倡导的这个节约运动，现已开始在各公营工厂中逐渐展开。华东煤业总公司蓬布间工人沈贵元等，已利用废油布修装好大蓬布十四块，为公家节省了材料。申新九厂铁工部职工，将废旧烂铁制成了机器零件。
