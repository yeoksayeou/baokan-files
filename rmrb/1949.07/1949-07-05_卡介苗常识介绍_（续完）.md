　　Eight. At what age is it appropriate to be vaccinated with BCG?

　　Anyone with a negative tuberculin test reaction, regardless of age or gender, can be vaccinated with BCG for immunization. According to survey results, the percentage of the population with negative reactions in Chinese cities is roughly as follows:

　　From birth to four years old - about 80 percent, five to nine years old - about 60 percent, ten to fourteen years old - about 30 percent, fifteen to nineteen years old - about 10 percent.

　　Very few adults over the age of twenty have negative reactions; more than 95 percent are positive. Therefore, BCG immunization should target those with the highest percentage of negative reactions, namely newborns and school-age children.

　　Nine. What is the effect of BCG immunization?

　　Aronson, from 1935, selected 1,550 people with negative tuberculin test reactions and immunized them with BCG. At the same time, 1,457 people with the same negative reactions were used as a control group. These people had the same gender, age, and number and lived in the same environment with the same living habits. The chance of contracting tuberculosis was exactly the same. After thirteen years of continuous investigation, it was found that only six people in the BCG-immunized group died of tuberculosis, while 53 people in the non-immunized group died of the disease.

　　Ten. Is BCG applicable in China?

　　There are only two effective methods of preventing tuberculosis: one is to find ways to isolate sources of infection, and the other is to find ways to increase immunity. The former hopes to send all people with tuberculosis to sanatoriums, where they can receive various treatments. At the same time, the most important thing is to isolate patients so that germs are not spread. After a considerable period of time, the number of patients can be reduced, and new patients are less likely to occur. Although this is a fundamental solution, it is currently impossible to do in China, because there are more patients, accounting for about 4 percent of the total population. Taking Beiping as an example, with a population of about two million, there are 80,000 people with tuberculosis. If all patients were to be sent to sanatoriums, not only is there no such equipment, but even if there were equipment, the living problems of the patients' families could not be solved, because most of the patients are working people. Therefore, this method is not easy to implement at present. Another method that can be done at present is to increase the people's resistance to tuberculosis. If it is found that family members of patients still have negative tuberculin reactions, BCG vaccination should be carried out immediately to increase immunity to the disease. This method should be vigorously promoted to achieve some of the effects of tuberculosis prevention.

　　Eleven. What is the method of BCG vaccination?

　　There are two methods that are more practical in China:

　　A. Scratch Method: This method is very similar to smallpox vaccination. Generally, the skin on the upper outer part of the left arm is cleaned. After the alcohol is completely dry, the vaccine is placed on the skin, and the skin is horizontally and vertically scratched several times with a sterilized needle, with an interval of about four *máo*@① for each line. It is best to use four needles, bound together in a row, and scratch once vertically and twice horizontally. The force should be uniform when scratching, so that it just breaks the epidermis without bleeding. After scratching, the needle can be slightly pressed on the skin so that the vaccine can contact the wound. After the vaccine is dry, the clothes can be put on. With this method, a more concentrated vaccine must be used, containing at least 20 *kèmáo*@② bacteria per cubic centimeter.

　　B. Intradermal Injection Method: Use a diluted vaccine containing one-quarter *kèmáo*@② to one-half *kèmáo*@② per cubic centimeter, and inject 0.1 cubic centimeter intradermally. The advantage of this method is the accuracy of the inoculation amount, but special attention should be paid during injection. Do not inject too deep to become a subcutaneous injection, as this can cause local ulcers or swollen lymph nodes.

　　Twelve. What are the steps for BCG vaccination?

　　BCG must be used with a detailed and thorough plan. Do not vaccinate casually to avoid accidents. The steps are described as follows:

　　A. First, perform a tuberculin test - the best way is to use one tuberculin unit, that is, 0.1 cubic centimeter containing one percent *máo*@② international standard tuberculin or one fifty-thousandth *máo*@② purified protein derivative, for intradermal injection. Observe the reaction after 72 hours. If it is negative, you can retry with ten tuberculin units. If it is still negative, you can vaccinate with BCG. If you want to save time and simplify the procedures, you can skip the previous steps and start with ten tuberculin units. If it is a newborn, you do not need to do this test and you can proceed with vaccination.

　　B. Before vaccination, you should contact the manufacturing room and notify the date and quantity of vaccine needed in advance so that it can be taken on time. In addition, you must pay attention when using it. Concentrated vaccine can only be used for the scratch method, and diluted vaccine can only be used for intradermal injection. The two must not be confused. Be sure to shake the vaccine liquid vigorously before use.

　　C. Four weeks after vaccination, the local reaction should be observed to see if it has been successfully vaccinated, whether there is suppuration or ulceration in the local area, and whether there are any symptoms such as enlarged lymph nodes nearby.

　　D. Two months after vaccination, another tuberculin test should be performed to see if it has turned positive.

　　卡介苗常识介绍

    八、何种年龄宜于接种卡介苗？
    凡结核素试验呈阴性反应的人，不论男女老少，均可以卡介苗作免疫接种，据调查结果我国城市中人口呈阴性反应的百分率大概如下：
    自初生至四岁——约百分之八十，五岁至九岁——约百分之六十，十岁至十四岁——约百分之三十，十五岁至十九岁——约百分之十。
    二十岁以上的成人呈阴性反应的极少，几百分之九十五以上均呈阳性，所以卡介苗免疫接种应选择阴性反应最多者为对象，即新生婴儿及学龄儿童。
    九、经卡介苗免疫，效果如何？
    阿伦孙氏于一九三五年起选择对结核素试验呈阴性的一五五○人，以卡介苗作免疫接种，同时以同样阴性反应的一四五七人作对照，这些人的性别年龄及数目均相等，同时都住在生活习惯相同的环境中，对于感染结核病的机会完全相等，经过十三年继续不断的调查，发觉经卡介苗免疫注射的人中仅六人死于结核病，而未经免疫的人中有五十三人死于该病。
    十、卡介苗在中国是否适用？
    有效的防痨方法不外两种：一种是设法隔绝传染病源，另一种是设法增加免疫力，前者是希望将所有患结核病的人送入疗养院中，一面可以施行各种治疗，同时最重要的是隔离病人，使病菌不致散布，经过相当时期后，病人数目即可减少，新的病人也不易发生。这虽是一个治本的方法，但是中国目前无法办到，因患者较多，几占全人口百分之四，以北平一市而言，有人口约二百万其中即有八万人患结核病，设若要将全体患者送入疗养院，不但无此设备，即算有设备，而病人的家属生活问题无法解决，因大部患者多系劳苦群众，所以这种方法，目下尚不易推行，目前可做的另一方法即是增加人民对于结核病的抵抗力，如发现患者家属中尚有结核素呈阴性反应的人，应立刻举行卡介苗预防接种以增加对该病的免疫力，这个方法应当竭力推行，以达到防痨的部分效果。
    十一、接种卡介苗的方法如何？
    在中国比较能实用者有两种：
    甲、划刺法：该方法与接种牛痘亟相类似，普通多在左肱上部外侧，将皮肤擦洁净俟酒精全干后，将菌苗置皮肤上，以消毒过的针横直画数条，每条间隔约为四＠①；最好以四个针，合订成一排，直划一次，横划两次。划时用力须均匀，以刚刺破表皮而不出血为最佳，划后可将针在皮上略加压力，使菌苗能与伤口接触，等菌苗干后，再将衣服穿上。用此法，则须使用较浓的菌苗，每公撮内至少含二十＠②的细菌。
    乙、皮内注射法：以稀淡的菌苗，每公撮内含四分之一＠②至二分之一＠②，以零点一公撮作皮内注射。此法之优点，在于接种量的准确，惟注射时应当特别注意，切不可过深而成皮下注射，如是可引起局部溃疡或淋巴线肿大等现象。
    十二、接种卡介苗之步骤如何？
    使用卡介苗必须有详细周密的计划，切不可随便接种，以免意外，今将进行步骤，分述如后：
    甲、先作结核素试验——最好的办法是以一个结核单位即零点一公撮内含百分之一＠②，国际标准结核素或五万分之一＠②纯蛋白衍化物，作皮内注射，经七十二小时后观察其反应，如属阴性可以十个结核单位重试，如仍为阴性，即可以卡介苗接种，若为节省时间及手续简便计，可将前部手续省去，即开始时以十个结核单位试验之，如属新生婴儿，可不用作此试验，即可举行接种。
    乙、接种之先，应与制造室取得联络，将需要菌苗之日期及数量先行通知，以便按时取用，此外于使用时必需注意，浓菌苗仅能用作划刺法，稀菌苗只可用作皮内注射，两者切不可混乱，使用前必需将菌液用力摇匀。
    丙、经接种后四星期，应观察局部反应，是否已经接种好，局部有无化脓或溃疡等现象，再附近淋巴线有无肿大等象征。
    丁、经接种两月后，应再举行结核素试验，以视其是否已经转变成阳性。
