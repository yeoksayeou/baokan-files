　　Safeguarding the People's Interests and Consolidating Revolutionary Order
  　The Ping Military Control Commission Issues a Notice to Register Personnel of Reactionary Parties
    Another Opportunity for Counter-Revolutionary Elements to Confess Their Crimes and Start Anew; Those Who Still Attempt to Conceal Themselves and Resist Will Be Severely Punished
    [Ping City News] In order to safeguard the people's interests and consolidate revolutionary order, the Ping Municipal Military Control Commission issued a notice yesterday (the 23rd) to register personnel of reactionary parties (the full text of the notice will be issued separately). To facilitate this work, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has set up registration offices in 20 sub-bureaus in the urban and suburban areas to handle the registration of personnel from reactionary parties and their various provincial and county party headquarters and party affairs offices in exile in this city. Registration offices or registration groups have also been set up in factories, schools, railways, mines, cultural organizations, public enterprises, and government agencies.
    In the half year since the liberation of Beiping, under the influence of the people's government's policies, most of the personnel of reactionary parties have reflected on their past actions, handed over their organizations, weapons, radios, documents, and files, and reformed themselves. However, there are still some personnel of reactionary parties who have not voluntarily registered and confessed their crimes with the public security organs, and some who are incorrigible, continuing to be enemies of the people, engaging in criminal activities such as spreading rumors, arson, poisoning, assassination, disrupting finance, undermining public security, and distorting government laws and decrees. In order to resolutely implement the decrees of the Military Control Commission, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has made proper arrangements for this registration, and will never let go of a bad person, nor wrong a good person. The responsible person of the bureau solemnly stated: This registration of personnel of various reactionary parties is another opportunity for them to confess their crimes and start anew. Those who do not apply for registration, attempt to conceal themselves and resist, or engage in activities that disrupt the registration and continue their counter-revolutionary activities, will be resolutely suppressed.

　　维护人民利益巩固革命秩序
  　平军管会发布布告登记反动党派人员
    再次给反革命分子以悔过自新机会，如尚图隐匿抗拒，定予从严惩处
    【平市讯】北平市军管会为维护人民利益，巩固革命秩序，特于昨（二十三）日发布布告，进行反动党派人员登记（布告全文另发）。市公安总局为便利此项工作进行，除城郊二十个分局均设立登记处，办理本市反动党派和反动党派各流亡省党部、县党部及党务办事处等人员登记外，各工厂、学校、铁路、矿山、文化团体、公营企业及政府各机构等，亦分别设立登记处或登记组。
    北平解放半年来，反动党派人员在人民政府政策感召下，大部进行反省，交出组织、武器、电台、证件及文件等，改过自新，但仍有一部反动党派人员，还未自动到公安机关登记悔过，且有怙恶不悛，继续与人民为敌，造谣、纵火、放毒、暗杀、捣乱金融、破坏治安、歪曲政府法令等罪恶活动者。市公安总局为坚决执行军管会法令，对此次登记，已有妥善布署，决不放过一个坏人，也不冤枉一个好人。该局负责人员严正表示：此次各反动党派人员登记，是再一次给予他们以悔过自新机会。凡不申请登记，企图隐匿抗拒，或有破坏登记之行为，仍进行其反革命活动者，则将坚决予以镇压。
