Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 1st. The Chinese delegation attending the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress took a special plane to Budapest at 3:00 PM today. Before departure, the delegation held a press conference at which the head of the delegation, Liu Ningyi, made the following statement:

　　The purpose of the Chinese workers' delegation's visit to Europe was to attend the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Milan. Due to the Italian government's refusal to issue entry visas, we have been detained in Prague for a full two weeks. During these two weeks, we have been warmly received and assisted by the Czechoslovak Trade Union and other organizations, for which we are deeply grateful.

　　For four years, the World Federation of Trade Unions has continuously struggled to unite the working class, for lasting peace, and to improve the economic and social status of workers. It has overcome various difficulties, defeated the conspiracies of the imperialists to split the solidarity of workers worldwide, and further exposed the conspiracy of the reactionary groups headed by US imperialism to launch a new war, thus greatly promoting the development, unity, and consolidation of the world's democratic forces. The establishment of the industrial trade departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the discussion of the Asian workers' movement will further unite and develop the world workers' movement. Precisely because of this, the imperialists are using various methods to try to undermine the World Federation of Trade Unions and obstruct the convening of the Congress.

　　The Italian government is faithfully implementing this general policy of undermining the unity of the working class, stubbornly refusing to issue entry visas to the Chinese delegation. According to the United Nations Charter, the people of all countries have the freedom to interact with each other. The Italian government's refusal to issue entry visas completely violates the United Nations Charter. The people of New China and the Italian people are extremely willing to establish friendly relations. We are convinced that any obstruction by the Italian government cannot stop the establishment of this relationship.

　　The Chinese delegation has to lodge a serious protest against this malicious behavior of the Italian government. We firmly believe that this behavior of the Italian government will also be condemned by the people all over the world.

　　We guarantee solidarity with the working class of all countries, guarantee full support for the World Federation of Trade Unions, and we are convinced that the victorious advance of the common cause of the world working class cannot be stopped by any reactionary forces.

　　刘宁一在捷京发表谈话
    感谢捷总工会热烈招待帮助抗议意政府恶意拒绝我入境
    【新华社布拉格一日电】参加世界工联代表大会的中国代表团，今日下午三时专机飞布达佩斯。代表团在行前举行记者招待会，由团长刘宁一发表谈话如下：
    中国职工代表团来欧的目的，是参加世界工联在米兰举行的第二届代表大会。由于意大利政府拒发入境签证，我们在捷京勾留了整整二周。两周以来，我们备受捷克总工会和其他机关团体的热烈招待和帮助，深为感谢。
    四年以来，世界工联曾不断地为争取工人阶级的团结、为持久和平和改善工人的经济和社会地位而斗争。它克服了各种困难，战胜了帝国主义者所策动的分裂全世界工人团结的诡计，它更进一步地揭露了以美帝国主义为首的反动集团掀起新战争的阴谋，因而大大促进了世界民主力量的发展、团结和巩固。世界工联各业职工部的建立，与对亚洲工人运动的讨论，将使世界工人运动更进一步地团结与发展。正因为如此，帝国主义者便用种种方法企图破坏世界工联及阻碍代表大会的召开。
    意大利政府忠实地执行着这个破坏工人阶级团结的总方针，顽梗地拒绝了发给中国代表团入境的签证。根据联合国宪章，各国人民有相互来往之自由，意大利政府的拒发入境签证，完全违背了联合国宪章，新中国的人民与意大利人民，极愿建立友善的关系。我们确信，意大利政府方面任何的阻挠行为，都挡不住这种关系的建立。
    对于意大利政府的这种恶意行为，中国代表团不得不提出严重抗议。我们深信：意大利政府的这种行为，也将为全世界的人民所谴责。
    我们保证和各国工人阶级的团结一致，保证全力支持世界工联，我们确信，世界工人阶级共同事业的胜利前进，绝不是任何反动势力所能阻挡的。
