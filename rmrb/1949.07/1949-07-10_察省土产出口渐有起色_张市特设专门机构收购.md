    [Chahar News] Chahar Province is rich in native products. According to investigations, the province's native product exports through Tianjin account for about one-fifth of the country's total exports annually. Among the native products, fruits, mountain goods, and medicinal materials occupy the main position, with an annual output of about 30 million jin. Among them, the red peony of Duolun, the daylily of Datong, sweet apricot kernels from various places in western Ping, apples from Huailai, and grapes from Xuanhua are all sold well at home and abroad. During the Anti-Japanese War, the output of mountain goods and medicinal materials gradually decreased. Currently, the exchange of materials at home and abroad has gradually become active, and the export situation of mountain goods and medicinal materials has also gradually improved in recent months. In view of this, the Provincial Trade Company specially established a specialized agency in Zhangjiakou City in early May to purchase mountain goods and medicinal materials from various places along the Ping-Sui Railway, in order to increase people's income and cooperate with and promote the overall production and construction of Chahar Province. The current problems are: insufficient understanding of the specific situation of the export of mountain goods and medicinal materials, and lack of timely business guidance. These problems will be gradually resolved in the future.

　　察省土产出口渐有起色　张市特设专门机构收购
    【察哈尔讯】察省土产丰富，据调查：每年由津出口土产约占全国总出口数的五分之一。土产中以果、山货、药材占主要地位。年产量约在三千万斤左右。其中如多伦赤芍，大同的黄花，平西各地的甜杏仁、怀来的苹果，宣化的葡萄等，都畅销中外。抗战期间，山货、药材的输出量日趋减少，目前国内外的物资交流已逐渐活跃，近月来山货、药材的出口情况也渐有起色。省贸易公司有鉴及此，特于五月初在张市设立专门机构，收购平绥线各地的山货、药材，以增加人民收入，并配合与推进整个察省的生产建设。目前存在的问题是：山货、药材出口的具体情况了解不够，缺乏及时的业务指导。这些问题今后将逐渐获得解决。
