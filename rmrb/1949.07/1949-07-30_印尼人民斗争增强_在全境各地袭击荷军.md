　　Indonesian People's Struggle Intensifies
  　Attacks on Dutch Troops Throughout the Country
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 29th] According to a TASS dispatch on the 27th, citing Dutch news agency reports: Indonesian people's resistance to Dutch troops is taking place not only in Java and Sumatra, but also on other islands. Recently, the Indonesian people's resistance to the invaders in Borneo has increased. The Indonesian people have achieved some victories in southern Borneo. Lubber, director of a large rubber plantation who recently returned to the Netherlands from Indonesia, told Dutch bourgeois reporters: "The future does not look good for us. In Java and Sumatra, the people's resistance is increasing month by month. Our situation is absolutely hopeless. Our government's policy has failed."
    The intensification of the Indonesian people's resistance can also be seen from the Dutch colonialists' intensified suppression of the Indonesian people. According to the Dutch Communist newspaper "Truth," Dutch colonial authorities have recently established many concentration camps in Java to imprison Indonesian patriots. For example, the concentration camp in Chirajaba holds more than 6,000 people who participated in the national liberation movement.

　　印尼人民斗争增强
  　在全境各地袭击荷军
    【新华社北平二十九日电】据塔斯社二十七日电引荷兰通讯社消息：印尼人民对荷军的抵抗，不仅在爪哇和苏门答腊，也在其他岛屿上进行。最近婆罗洲印尼人民对侵略者的抵抗已形增加。印尼人民已在婆罗洲南部获得若干胜利。最近从印尼返荷兰的大橡树园董事鲁伯对荷兰资产阶级记者说：“对我们来说，前途并不好。在爪哇与苏门答腊，人民的抵抗逐月增强。我们的情况是绝对没有希望的。我国政府的政策已告失败。”
    印尼人民抵抗的增强，也可以从荷兰殖民者加紧对印尼人民的镇压上看出来。据荷共真理报消息：荷兰殖民地当局最近已在爪哇建立许多监禁印尼爱国分子的集中营。例如奇拉加巴的一个集中营内，就拘禁着六千余参加民族解放运动的人们。
