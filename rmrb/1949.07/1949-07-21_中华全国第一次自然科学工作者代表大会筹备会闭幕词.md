Closing Speech at the Preparatory Meeting of the First National Congress of Natural Science Workers of China
Wu Yuzhang

The preparatory meeting of the First National Congress of Natural Science Workers of China has come to a successful conclusion. We have already begun to unite and organize natural science workers. This is a great victory on the agenda of new democratic economic construction. In order to further expand and consolidate our unity, I will talk again about several issues that our science workers should clearly understand today:

I. Stand Firm, Strengthen Unity.

When it comes to standing, we usually talk about class standing. Why do I want to talk about this issue today? Because some natural science workers often think that science transcends class. They are satisfied with deep academic pursuits and mastery of their profession. They don't care who they serve. They will do things for whoever employs them. Let's not talk about those who do not recognize the existence of classes in society. Even those who acknowledge the existence of classes in society often consider themselves as "liberals" or "middle-of-the-roaders," thinking that "natural science has nothing to do with political struggle or class struggle." But in reality, this is not the case. Because "in class society, a person's class nature is a kind of instinct, a kind of essence." No one can escape from society. Now, whether from the domestic or international situation, the political struggle and class struggle are very acute. Your work, directly or indirectly, either serves the revolutionary class or the counter-revolutionary class. One or the other must be the case; there is no middle road. A rifle, a bomb, a cannon, in the hands of imperialists or reactionaries, are counter-revolutionary tools that can kill revolutionary people, and that is a crime. The more sophisticated these killing tools are, the greater the crime. If rifles, bombs, and cannons are in the hands of the revolutionary people, then they become revolutionary weapons that save the vast majority of the people. Isn't this obvious? When you contribute your skills, shouldn't you think about who you are serving? I think you should think about it, and you should recognize whether you are standing on the counter-revolutionary side or the revolutionary side. You cannot consider yourself in a detached position.

China is a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. Now, the targets of the Chinese revolution are the three enemies: imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. They collude with each other and use each other to oppress and exploit the Chinese people. They form a counter-revolutionary and anti-people camp. The basic driving forces of the revolution are the proletariat, the peasant class, and the urban petty bourgeoisie. And in a certain period and to a certain extent, there is also the national bourgeoisie. These four friends, under the leadership of the proletarian party, form a revolutionary united front and a revolutionary camp. The revolutionary experience of the past twenty years has proven that if this revolutionary united front is carried out well, the revolution can achieve victory; otherwise, the revolution will suffer setbacks or failure. Therefore, I hope that our science workers will have class consciousness and stand firm on the revolutionary class's position. Only by standing on the correct class position can our will be unified and our unity be consolidated.

II. Self-Reliance, Overcome Difficulties.

Now, the open reactionary armed forces in the country can soon be eliminated, and the task of economic construction has been put on the agenda. However, due to the existence of foreign enemies—imperialists—and the fact that domestic enemies, although defeated, such as the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, are still attempting to operate from Taiwan and the Philippines, not hesitating to act as a government in exile, colluding with American imperialism, and making a desperate struggle. These domestic and foreign enemies will try every possible means to sabotage the achievements of the revolution. The reactionary clique has openly declared that it will blockade our seaports, and the imperialists are also threatening and enticing us, wanting us to remain within their framework and submit to them. They think that China cannot survive without relying on imperialism, especially Shanghai, the largest seaport in the East with a population of six million. If it is blockaded, it will immediately be unable to survive. They are counting on this move as a fatal blow. Of course, the blockade of Shanghai, cutting off maritime transportation and hindering our own material exchanges, will inevitably create great difficulties for Shanghai. Because Shanghai is the largest seaport for the import of imperialist goods into China, with a particularly large population, and relies heavily on foreign materials, this difficulty is not insurmountable, because during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation, Chiang Kai-shek and the imperialists had strictly blockaded us, and we successfully overcame these difficulties. We were able to overcome difficulties in such small base areas in the past, so can't we overcome difficulties now that we have the strength of the entire China? Although the situation is somewhat different today, people can always transform their environment.

The way to overcome difficulties is to seek self-reliance by thinking of all kinds of methods. This is something we have experience in. If our policies are correct and we can mobilize the broad masses of the people and rely on the masses, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. China has very good material conditions and a large population. The Chinese people are brave and intelligent. There are many past facts that can prove this. For example, when our army needed to cross the river quickly and there was no way to build a bridge, our soldiers could form "human bridges." When we attacked the city and had no ladders, our soldiers could form "human ladders." Our brave soldiers could even, with unparalleled sacrificial spirit, hold explosives and blow up bunkers. These extraordinary difficulties can be overcome, so what other difficulties can we not overcome? We should not be intimidated by the lies of those conspirators. We should be good at utilizing China's vast human and material resources. We have the confidence to be self-reliant and build a new China. Precisely because of the reactionary forces and the imperialists' blockade of Shanghai, Shanghai will undergo a major transformation, turning the semi-colonial Shanghai into an independent Shanghai that does not rely on foreign countries. Then, the difficulties created by the enemy will instead promote Shanghai's happiness. The saying "hardships make a jade perfect" will be proven here. To achieve this great transformation is not easy; it is a combat mission. This requires our science workers and brave people to demonstrate their strength with a fighting spirit.

III. Patriotism and Internationalism

I would also like to say a few words about this issue. In the past, China was a country ruled by reactionaries. Although it had very lovely natural conditions, this reactionary ruler was extremely unlovable. The reactionary rulers made the country a mess and trampled the people into such poverty. What was there to love? But today is different. The beautiful rivers and mountains and abundant resources are already in the hands of the people themselves. What reason do we have not to love it? Therefore, we must become true patriots. When we encounter foreign invasions, we vow not to surrender. No matter what, we must defeat the enemy and preserve ourselves. Many historical events in China's past have proven this point. But when our nation is very strong, we will not invade others, as the American imperialists are doing today. We respect and are friendly to the people of all countries in the world. We treat them as brothers and sisters, especially to the socialist countries of the Soviet Union and the truly people's democratic new democratic countries that treat me equally, we are even more friendly and have aligned interests. This true spirit of internationalism should be possessed. Our natural scientists, like other scientific workers, must recognize this point. Today, the world is divided into two major camps, and the struggle is acute. The American imperialists advocate "cosmopolitanism" as a mask for aggression, which is a very obvious contrast. Our internationalism is the true great unity of the people of the whole world, and it is the true equal combination of all nations. There is no contradiction between internationalism and patriotism. The two are complementary. Without the former, the latter will become narrow nationalism; without the latter, the former cannot be realized.

Comrades in natural science, let us organize and unite to better contribute our wisdom to the people, benefit the people, and serve the people wholeheartedly. This is our aspiration, and this is the starting point of our work in the future. We must, like the People's Liberation Army, continue to complete our tasks with one great victory after another.

　　中华全国第一次自然科学工作者代表大会筹备会闭幕词
    吴玉章
    中华全国第一次自然科学工作者代表大会筹备会胜利闭幕了。我们已经开始把自然科学工作者团结起来，组织起来，这是新民主主义经济建设日程上一个大胜利。为了使我们的团结更加扩大和巩固，我再来讲一讲我们科学工作者今天应该清楚认识的几个问题：
    一、站稳立场，加强团结。
    说到立场，我们通常都是讲阶级立场。为什么今天我要讲这一问题呢？因为有些自然科学工作者，常常认为科学是超阶级的。他们满足于学术的深造，业务的精通。为谁服务他们是不管的。只要谁用他，就替谁做做事。那些不承认社会有阶级存在的人姑且不去说他，就是承认社会有阶级，而常常以“自由主义”、“中间人士”自居，以为“自然科学与政治斗争、阶级斗争无关”。但实际上决不是这样。因为“在阶级社会中，人的阶级性，就是人的一种本能，一种本质。”谁也不能逃出社会之外去。现在无论从国内和国际的情形来说，政治斗争和阶级斗争都是非常尖锐的时代，你的工作直接的或间接的，不是为革命阶级一边服务，就是为反革命阶级一边服务。二者必居其一，绝无中间道路。一枝步枪，一颗炸弹，一尊大炮，操在帝国主义者或反动派手里，就是反革命的工具，可以杀死革命的人民，这就是罪恶。这种杀人的工具越精则罪恶越大。如果枪炮炸弹操在革命的人民手里，那就成了革命的武器，就救了广大的人民，这不是很明显的事情吗？难道你供献你的技能时，不应该想一想为谁服务吗？我认为是应该想一想的，应该认识自己是站在反革命立场呢？还是站在革命的立场呢？不能自居于超然的地位。
    中国是半殖民地半封建的国家，现在中国革命的对象，是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义这三个敌人，他们互相勾结，互相利用来压迫和剥削中国人民，他们结成反革命反人民的营垒。革命的动力基本的是无产阶级、农民阶级与城市小资产阶级。而在一定的时期中，一定的程度上，还有民族资产阶级。这四个朋友在无产阶级的政党领导下，结成革命的统一战线，结成革命的营垒。二十多年来革命的经验证明，这一革命的统一战线如果进行得好，革命就能得到胜利，否则革命就要遭受挫折或失败。因此，我希望我们科学工作者，要有阶级意识，站稳革命阶级立场，只有站在正确的阶级立场上，意志才能统一，团结才能巩固。
    二、自力更生，克服困难。
    现在国内公开的反动派武装力量，不久可以肃清，经济建设的任务已经提到日程上来了。但由于国外敌人——帝国主义者还存在，国内敌人虽然失败了，蒋介石反动集团还企图由台湾而菲律宾，不惜作流亡政府，与美帝国主义勾结，作垂死的挣扎。这些国内外敌人将千方百计地来企图破坏革命的成果。反动派集团已公开宣告要封锁我们海口，帝国主义者也威迫利诱，想要我们就他们的范，向他们屈服。他们以为中国不依赖帝国主义就不能生存，尤其是上海这个六百万人口的东方第一海港，如果一封锁就立刻无法生活下去。他们的算盘打上这一着，以为这是一个致命的打击。当然，封锁上海，使海上交通切断，我们自己的物资交流受阻，必然造成上海的一大困难。由于上海是帝国主义商品输入中国的最大海口，人口特别多，依靠外来的物资很多，但这种困难不是不能克服的，因为八年抗日战争和三年解放战争，蒋介石和帝国主义都曾经严密地封锁过我们，我们很胜利地克服了这个困难。从前那样小的边区我们还能克服困难，难道现在我们有全中国这样大的力量，还不能克服困难吗？今天的情势虽然有些不同，但人总是能改造环境的。
    克服困难的方法，就在于要想种种办法来求得自力更生。这是我们有经验的，如果我们的政策正确，能动员广大的人民，依靠群众，就没有不能克服的困难。我们中国有很好的物质条件，有众多的人民，中国人民是英勇的，聪明的，过去有不少的事实可以证明，例如：当我大军要迅速渡河，河上无法架桥时，我们的战士可以架成“肉桥”；当我们攻城没有梯子时，我们的战士可以架成“肉梯子”；我们英勇的战士更可以无比的牺牲精神，抱着炸药去炸碉堡。这些非常的困难都能克服，难道还有什么困难我们不能克服呢？我们不要被那些阴谋家的谰言所吓倒，我们应当善于利用中国广大的人力物力，我们有信心来自力更生，建设新中国。正因为反动派和帝国主义对于上海的封锁，使上海来一个大转变，把半殖民地的上海变成一个独立而不依靠外国的上海。那末，敌人造成的困难，反而促成上海的幸福，所谓“艰难玉汝于成”将在这里得到证明。要做到这一伟大的转变，不是容易的，是一个战斗的任务。这就要靠我们科学工作者和英勇的人民，以战斗的精神表现自己的力量。
    三、爱国主义与国际主义
    这个问题我也想谈几句，过去的中国是反动派统治的国家，它虽然有极可爱的自然条件，但这个反动的统治者却极不可爱，反动统治者把国家弄得稀烂，把人民＠踏得如此穷困，还有什么可爱的地方呢？但是今天不同了，美丽的河山，丰富的资源已经掌握在人民自己的手中，我们有什么理由不爱它呢？因此我们必须成为一个真正的爱国主义者，当我们遭遇到外寇的侵略时，我们誓不投降，无论如何，我们要击败敌人，保存我们自己。中国过去若干历史事迹都证明了这一点。但当我们民族很强大时，我们也不去侵略别人，象美帝国主义者今天所做的那样，我们对于世界各个国家里的人民是尊重的，友好的，我们是视同手足弟兄，特别对于以平等待我的苏联社会主义国家及真正人民民主的新民主主义的国家，更是友好的，利害一致的。这种真正的国际主义精神是应当具备的，我们自然科学者与其他科学工作者一样，要认清这点。今天世界上分成两大营垒，斗争是尖锐的。美帝国主义者提倡“世界主义”来作为侵略的假面具，这是很明显的一个对照。我们的国际主义才是真正全世界人民的大团结，才是各民族真正平等的结合。国际主义与爱国主义是无丝毫矛盾之处的，两者是相成的，没有前者，后者必变成狭隘的民族主义；没有后者，则前者也无从实现。
    自然科学工作同志们，组织起来，团结起来，更好的把我们的智慧供献给人民，造福于人民，全心全意为人民服务，这就是我们的志愿，这就是我们今后工作的出发点。我们要象人民解放军一样，继续不断地一个大胜利接着又一个大胜利来完成我们的任务。
