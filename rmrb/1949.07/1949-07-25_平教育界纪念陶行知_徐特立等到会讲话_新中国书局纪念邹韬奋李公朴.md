　　Beiping Educational Circles Commemorate Tao Xingzhi
    Xu Teli and Others Attend and Speak
  　New China Bookstore Commemorates Zou Taofen and Li Gongpu
    [Beiping News] Five thousand teachers and staff of primary and secondary schools, as well as students from the Normal University and the Second Division of North China University, gathered at the Si Cun Middle School on Fuyou Street at 7:30 last night (the 24th) to commemorate the third anniversary of the death of Mr. Tao Xingzhi. Veteran educators Xu Teli and Wu Yuzhang, as well as Mr. Li Dequan, Lin Kuangru, Chen Qiyuan and others, attended the meeting and spoke.
    The memorial service began with a dirge. Everyone stood up and bowed their heads in front of Mr. Tao's giant portrait, remembering this brilliant people's educator. A student from the Normal University read a memorial oration, telling Mr. Tao: "Everyone is now living under the banner of Mao Zedong, breathing the air of freedom. In the new China, we see countless educators tirelessly working to educate the next generation. Your legacy has been realized, and we will commemorate you with our work."
    After Chairman Fang Yuyan delivered a speech, Xu Teli, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and a veteran educator, spoke. Old Xu recalled the facts of running education in the Jiangxi Soviet area during the civil war, explaining that Mr. Tao's proposition of "knowing is doing" and the integration of teaching and learning was correct, and that Mr. Tao's direction was the direction of people's education. Then Wu Yuzhang, President of North China University, spoke. Old Wu first pointed out that Mr. Tao was killed by the Kuomintang; then he said that Mr. Tao's education was progressive education that met the requirements of the times. He was a Marxist, and his educational and political lines were in line with the propositions of the Communist Party of China. Finally, Old Wu called on everyone to learn from Mr. Tao. Li Dequan, Lin Liru, and Chen Qiyuan spoke successively. Xue Chengye, chairman of the Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Union, called on all education workers in the city to unite closely under the banner of Mao Zedong and work hard for the people's education, using this to commemorate Mr. Tao. Finally, two children from the Attached Elementary School of the Normal University recited Mr. Tao's poems.
