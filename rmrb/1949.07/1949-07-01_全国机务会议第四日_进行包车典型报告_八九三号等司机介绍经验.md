　　【This Newspaper's Report】Yesterday (30th), the Ministry of Railways' National Locomotive Affairs Conference conducted a model report on contracted locomotives. The 893 Contracted Locomotive Team of the Dunhua Locomotive Depot in Northeast China is a well-known youth team. Driver Wang Yanqing reported that the team members studied technology humbly and conscientiously. Under the influence of the Communist Party members, they united and transformed the backward team members, raised their awareness, and only then created brilliant achievements. In January 1949, the daily mileage of the locomotive was 179.5 kilometers, and the technical speed was 32.7 kilometers. By April, the daily mileage had increased to 425.7 kilometers, and the technical speed had increased to 38.45 kilometers, exceeding the bureau's set standard. Under the principle of driving fast, they did not forget to be cautious and prevented seven accidents. The team members were careful and responsible in their work, strived to study and master the characteristics of the locomotive, maintained the quality of the locomotive, created the highest record of coal saving in the Jilin Railway Bureau, and learned Category B and C maintenance. Zhang Zhongye, driver of Locomotive No. 884 of the Hailar Locomotive Depot of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau in Northeast China, reported that the locomotive had exceeded two inspection checks in thirteen months from March of last year to April of this year, safely traveling 110,100 kilometers without any accidents. This was the result of their establishment of group covenants and handover systems, and the implementation of responsibility to every specific task. Li Yonglu, driver of Locomotive No. 1939 of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Pingjin Railway Bureau, reported that when the contract system was first implemented in Fengtai, everyone did not understand the true meaning of the contract system. However, after the locomotives were contracted, everyone carefully inspected and repaired them, and the efficiency was improved, initially improving the condition of the locomotives. In April, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive came to Fengtai from the Northeast. Locomotive No. 1939 learned the methods and experience of the contract system from them, and also learned criticism and self-criticism, breaking through the difficulties of contracted locomotives, and immediately showed results.

　　全国机务会议第四日
  　进行包车典型报告
    八九三号等司机介绍经验
    【本报讯】铁道部全国机务会议昨（三十）日进行机车包车机型报告。东北敦化机务段八九三包车组是有名的青年组，该组司机王彦清报告说：该包车组大伙虚心认真学习技术，在党员组员的影响下团结改造了落后的组员，提高了觉悟，才创造了光辉的成绩。一九四九年一月该机车的日车公里为一七九·五公里，技术速度三二·七公里，到四月日车公里已提高至四二五·七公里，技术速度提高到三八·四五公里。超过了局定标准。他们在开得快的原则下，丝毫没有忘记稳健，前后防止了七次事故。组员们在乘务作业中仔细负责，努力钻研，掌握了机车的性格，保持了机车的质量，创造了吉林局节约煤的最高纪录，并学会了乙丙检修。东北齐齐哈尔局海拉尔机务段八八四号机车司机张忠业报告该车自去年三月至今年四月，十三个月中超过两次验检，安全行走十一万零一百公里，未发生一次事故，这是由于他们订了小组公约和交接班等各种制度，贯彻负责制到每一个具体工作中的结果。平津局丰台机务段一九三九号机车司机李永禄报告包乘制在丰台开始实行的时候，大家不了解包乘制的真意，但在机车包乘后，大家检修仔细，效力提高，初步改善了机车的状况；四月，毛泽东号从东北来到丰台，一九三九号向他们学习了包乘制的办法与经验，更学习了批评与自我批评，打破包车的困难，立刻就显出了成绩。
