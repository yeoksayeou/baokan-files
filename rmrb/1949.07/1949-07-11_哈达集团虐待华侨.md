　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 10th: A Chinese newspaper in Batavia reported on the 9th: The situation of Overseas Chinese in Yogyakarta is deteriorating day by day. Since the Hatta reactionary group restored its "regime" on July 1st, incidents of abuse of Overseas Chinese have emerged one after another. The morally corrupt Hatta army often breaks into the homes of Overseas Chinese and loots at will. They have no scruples even in broad daylight.
