Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: TASS, Rome dispatch: The Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party published a communique in L'Unità on July 14 regarding the assassination attempt on the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, a year ago, stating that the attempt to murder Togliatti’s life "marked the starting point of the reactionary group launching a suppression, attempting to destroy the democratic movement with violence." The great strength of the people's movement stopped this provocation, which fully demonstrated the political maturity of the masses of the people who are determined to defend their achievements.

The communique pointed out that the activities insisted upon by all party members throughout last year made the party organizations and mass organizations, which the enemy had hoped to weaken, even more powerful and stronger. The Italian Communist Party, under the leadership of Togliatti—who has resumed his work and struggle—has become a reliable fortress of Italian democracy. It leads the broad front of the working people and patriots against the government that serves the privileged class and foreigners and its new attempts to plunge Italy into poverty and war.

The communique finally stated that in order to remind the people of those significant days of July 1948, to encourage all working people to become familiar with the party's activities, and to express the loyalty of millions of communists and democrats to Togliatti, July 17 will be celebrated as "Communist Party Day."
