Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 28th: TASS, Helsinki, July 26th: The Executive Committee of the Finnish Communist Party passed a resolution on the current situation, stating: "When the Fagerholm government was declared established, the Executive Committee of the Finnish Communist Party immediately passed a resolution describing the characteristics of the Fagerholm government's economic policy as follows: 'The purpose of the government's economic policy is to more closely unite Finland with the crisis-stricken Western economy, consolidate the power of the big capitalists, worsen the situation of the working people, and increase the capitalists' income by billions of profits. Twenty capitalist tycoons are trying to split the trade union movement and destroy the fighting strength of the working class, so as to impose the serious consequences of the coming crisis on the shoulders of the working people.' This prediction was fully confirmed last year. The big capitalists launched an attack on the living conditions of workers and laboring peasants.
　　With the assistance of the Social Democratic officials of the Price and Wage Committee, they cut wages in many industrial sectors and institutions, and threatened to further reduce wages. Rents have increased greatly, and the government intends to increase them even higher this year. The price of bread has doubled, and the prices of margarine and many other goods have also risen. Shoes have risen by 6 to 15 percent, firewood by 30 to 35 percent, and bathhouse and barber shop fees by 40 to 50 percent. The devaluation of the mark, permitted by the government at the request of American capitalists, has caused the prices of imported goods to rise and has increased the cost of domestically manufactured goods, such as textiles, shoes, and other industries. In addition, as a result of the devaluation of the mark, the country's foreign debt has increased by 7.5 billion marks, which means that each taxpayer has to bear an additional 7,500 marks in taxes. In other words, a quarter of the reparations that Finland was exempted from paying due to the Soviet Union's reduction of its claims for compensation from Finland has been turned into the profits of capitalists—exporters who profited during the last war. Many large enterprises doubled their profits last year.
　　The economic crisis threatening the capitalist world will undoubtedly reduce the possibility of selling Finnish products to capitalist countries. Our party warns of the threat of crisis and demands that the main part of our foreign trade be turned to countries without crises—the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. But the government refuses to take measures to separate Finland from the Western economy and avoid being affected by the crisis. It follows an anti-Finnish policy that harms our country's interests, and a policy that serves the interests of American capitalists. Although the Fagerholm government's economic policy has seriously affected the lives of the working people, the leadership of the Finnish trade union movement, which is controlled by the Social Democrats, has not taken any steps to improve the living conditions of the working people and repel the capitalists' attacks. This is why trade unions that pay attention to the interests of the working people have taken the initiative at the request of their members to protect the interests of workers in their respective industrial sectors. Seven trade unions have written to the Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions, demanding that immediate measures be taken to raise the wages of the working people. These trade unions represent about 100,000 organized workers in our country. The Communist Party, which has always struggled to improve the living conditions of the working people, once again regards it as its responsibility to support the workers' struggle to improve their situation, and to support all measures taken by the working class's organizations for the same purpose. The interests of workers and all laborers require unity and concentration of forces, so that large companies cannot, as the capitalists did in the 1930s, once again shift the burden of the economic crisis onto the shoulders of the people living in the most difficult economic conditions. Employers are trying to obstruct this unity and are trying to first attack individual workers' organizations, thereby gradually splitting the ranks of the working class. The strikes of workers at the Porssaari factory and dockworkers at the Port of Kemi, and other workers against wage cuts, constitute such a struggle, and if this struggle is victorious, it will be of great significance in repelling the general offensive of big capital. Life proves that the unity and mutual support of the workers is the first prerequisite for victory and success. It is necessary to resolutely repel the activities of capitalist agents who attempt to split the labor movement, and it is necessary to concentrate all forces to counter the onslaught of big capital. The Executive Committee of the Finnish Communist Party advises workers to consolidate their organizational strength and fighting strength, support the struggles of strikers, and insistently demand the improvement of their living conditions."

### 芬共通过当前形势决议  抨击政府反动政策　号召工人团结斗争改善生活

　　芬共通过当前形势决议
    抨击政府反动政策
  　号召工人团结斗争改善生活
    【新华社北平二十八日电】塔斯社赫尔辛基二十六日讯：芬兰共产党执委会通过关于当前形势的决议称：“芬兰共产党执委会曾在法吉荷尔姆政府宣告成立的时候，就立即通过了一项决议，把法吉荷尔姆政府的经济政策的特点描述如下：“政府经济政策的目的，是在使芬兰和遭受危机的西方经济更紧密地联合起来，并巩固大资本家的力量，以恶化劳动人民的境遇，来使资本家增加数十亿利润的收入。二十个资本豪门力图分裂职工运动和破坏工人阶级的斗争力量，以便把行将来临的危机的严重后果强加于劳动人民的肩上。”去年完全证实了这一预断。大资本家对工人和劳动农民的生活条件发动了进攻。
    他们在物价与工资委员会的社会民主党官员的援助下，在许多工业部门和许多工业机构中削减了工资，并威胁着要进一步减削工资。房租已大大增加了，政府有意在本年把它增加得更高。面包价格已上涨一倍，人造奶油与其他许多货物的价格也都上涨了，鞋类涨了百分之六到百分之十五，木柴涨了百分之三十到百分之三十五，而澡堂与理发店的收费上涨了百分之四十到百分之五十。政府按照美国大资本家的要求而许可实行的马克贬值，引起了进口货物价格的上涨。而且使本国制造的货物的成本增高，例如纺织、制鞋和其他工业就是如此。此外，由于马克贬值的结果，国家的外债增加了七十五亿马克，它意味着每一纳税人又多负担七千五百马克的税款。换句话说，因苏联减少对芬的赔偿要求而使芬兰所得到的免付的赔款，有四分之一已化为资本家——上次战争中获利的出口商——的利润了。许多大企业在去年所获得的利润增加了一倍。
    威胁着资本主义世界的经济危机，无疑地将减低芬兰产品售与资本主义国家的可能性。我党警告着危机的威胁，并要求把我国对外贸易的主要部分转向那些没有危机的国家——苏联和人民民主国家。但是政府拒绝采取使芬兰脱离西方经济以免于遭受危机影响的措施，它遵循着损害我国利益的反芬兰的政策，遵循着服务于美国大资本家利益的政策。虽然法吉荷尔姆政府的经济政策严重地影响了劳动人民的生活，然而社会民主党人所控制的芬兰职工运动的领导机构，却不采取任何步骤，去改善劳动人民的生活条件和击退资本家的进攻。这就是那些注意到劳动人民的利益的职工会本着会员们的要求，在维护其各该工业部门的工人利益上采取主动的原因。有七个职工会写信给芬兰职工会中央联合会，要求立即采取提高劳动人民的工资的措施。这些职工会代表着我国约十万名有组织的工人。经常为改进劳动人民的生活条件而斗争的共产党，这一次又把支持工人改进其境遇的斗争，以及支持工人阶级的组织为同一目的而采取的一切措施，看作是它的责任。工人和一切劳动者的利益，要求团结和集中力量，俾使大公司不能象资本家在三十年代所曾做过的那样，再度把经济危机的重担转嫁到生活在最困难的经济条件之下的人民的肩上。雇主们正试图阻挠这一团结，并试图首先打击个别的工人组织，从而达到逐渐分裂工人阶级阵线的目的。鲍萨里工厂工人和开密港的码头工人及其他工人反对削减工资的罢工，构成了这样一种斗争，这种斗争如获胜利，对击退大资本的总进攻，是有着非常重大的意义。生活证明：工人们的团结和彼此声援，是胜利和成功的第一个先决条件。必须坚决击退图谋分裂劳工运动的资本家走卒的活动，必须集中一切力量来反击大资本的猛攻。芬兰共产党执行委员会忠告工人们：巩固他们的组织力量和斗争力量，支持罢工者的斗争，并坚持不屈地要求改进他们的生活条件。”
