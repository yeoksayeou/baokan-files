　　Further Strengthening of International Solidarity of the Working Class
    The activities of international solidarity of the working class have been a prominent event in the past week.
    According to the decision of the Provisional Preparatory Committee of the International Trade Departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the founding congresses of the International Shoe and Leather Workers' Trade Department, the International Hardware Workers' Trade Department, and the International Textile and Garment Workers' Trade Department have been held in Gottwaldov, Turin, and Lyon respectively. The three congresses adopted the charters of their respective trade departments and elected their leadership bodies. The founding congresses of the International Mining Workers' Trade Department, the International Woodworking and Building Materials Workers' Trade Department, and the International Seafarers and Dockers' Trade Department will also be held in Florence and Milan in mid-July respectively. The establishment or impending establishment of the aforementioned trade departments will further strengthen the solidarity of the working classes of all countries. From now on, the central trade unions of various industries in various countries can not only indirectly connect through the WFTU, but also directly contact each other in the trade departments. Moreover, after the establishment of these trade departments, the struggle of the WFTU to defend world democracy and peace can be concretely combined with the vital interests of workers in various countries, thereby greatly enhancing the influence and prestige of the WFTU among the working class.
    The most important event in the international solidarity of the working class is the opening of the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions on June 29. In the Milan Art Palace where the WFTU Congress was held, the slogans "Long live the international solidarity of the working people!" and "Long live the consolidation and lasting peace among all nations!" resonated. On the opening day, WFTU Acting Chairman Vittorio delivered an important speech to the congress, and WFTU General Secretary Saillant made a general report on the activities of the WFTU. The congress will also hear many individual reports, including a report on the activities of Asian trade unions. The congress will elect the leadership of the WFTU. The Chinese people congratulate the convening of this world working-class solidarity congress and wish the congress success. Due to the obstruction of the reactionary Italian government, the Chinese trade union delegation was unable to enter Italy to participate in the WFTU Congress. Previously, the reactionary French government had also prevented the Chinese delegation from going to Lyon to attend the founding congress of the International Textile and Garment Workers' Trade Department. The Chinese trade union delegation has lodged a serious protest with the governments of Italy and France against this reactionary behavior. Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation, also issued a statement in Prague stating: "We guarantee unity with the working classes of all countries and guarantee to fully support the WFTU. We are convinced that the victorious advance of the world working class and its common cause cannot be stopped by any reactionary forces."
    The WFTU is the first truly international workers' organization in history to unite vast numbers of workers of different countries, races, and religions. It unites 65 million organized workers from 52 countries. Since its establishment in 1945, the WFTU has gone through a rather tortuous path. The reactionary trade union leaders of the United States and Britain once joined the WFTU. They originally wanted to seize the leadership of the WFTU from within, so that the WFTU would become a tool to serve the monopoly capitalists and the Marshall Plan. However, this plan failed, and they retreated in disgrace from the WFTU. They had hoped to weaken and destroy the WFTU by withdrawing, but this conspiracy also failed. After they withdrew, the WFTU was not weakened, but strengthened. Since Carey and Deakin withdrew from the WFTU in January, the progressive trade unions of Japan, Germany, Tunisia, the Philippines, Chile, Panama, Mongolia, and South Korea have either joined or are preparing to join the WFTU. The trade departments of the WFTU have also been established, which was already stipulated in the charter of the WFTU, but due to the obstruction of the American and British trade unionists, it had not been implemented for a long time.
    When the conspiracies and tricks of the reactionary trade union leaders of the United States and Britain were shattered one after another, they convened a preparatory meeting of the so-called "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" in Geneva on June 25 and 26, and prepared to formally establish a reactionary "international" trade union organization in November, in an attempt to destroy the WFTU from the outside and undermine the solidarity of the international workers' movement. However, in the face of the further unity of the world working class, their despicable attempts will, as in the past, continue to suffer failure.
    The great strike of two million agricultural workers in Italy, after bravely persisting for 36 days, ended victoriously on June 23. With their own united struggle and the strong support of the entire Italian working class, the agricultural workers smashed all the offensives of the government and landlords, forcing them to accept the agricultural workers' demands on wages, unemployment insurance, and other aspects, and agreed to sign the first unified national contract in Italian history with the agricultural workers. Therefore, the victory of the agricultural workers' strike, which began with the demand for economic rights, also has significant political significance. In today's increasingly acute class struggle in Italy, the victory of the agricultural workers' great strike, as the Italian Communist Party Central Committee's communique pointed out, "is a brilliant example of the unity and determination of the Italian people in the struggle for just demands. It is a major achievement of the power of the people."
    The French people have recently carried out several new struggles. On June 18, a large demonstration of 200,000 people was held in Paris to oppose de Gaulle's conspiracy to carry out a fascist coup. On June 15, one million civil servants held a "warning strike." On June 26, veterans organized a demonstration. In addition, French farmers are fighting to prevent reactionaries from forcibly confiscating products. French merchants are also protesting against the imposition of extra taxes.
    The founding congress of the Korean Democratic Fatherland Front was held in Pyongyang from June 25 to 28. The seventy or eighty North and South Korean democratic parties and public organizations participating in the founding congress unanimously adopted a common program of struggle and elected the Central Committee of the United Front to more effectively lead the nationwide struggle. The achievements of the congress and the establishment of the Democratic Fatherland Front demonstrate the irresistibility of the power of the entire Korean people, who have further united to fight for the democracy, independence, and unification of Korea; at the same time, this also proves that the US imperialist policy of splitting Korea and enslaving the Korean people is suffering serious setbacks. As Xu Xian pointed out in the political report to the congress: Korea "already has all the necessary conditions to become an independent country," "no force can prevent the Korean people from uniting and jointly building an independent and democratic country."
    The agreements reached at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference on the German question and the Austrian treaty have been unanimously welcomed by progressive public opinion around the world. Progressive public opinion pointed out that the most important result of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is the undoubted failure of the policy of dividing Germany, which deteriorated international relations, and the undoubted success of the policy of restoring German unity, ameliorating international relations, and seeking international cooperation. However, regarding the results of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the US officialdom issued self-serving statements. US President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson insisted that the Paris agreement "proves" that the "correct course" that the United States follows in foreign policy is the result of the "firm policy" of the Western countries and the result of the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty. This statement by the US officialdom was refuted by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and exposed by Soviet public opinion. Pravda pointed out that those gentlemen "had to resort to boasting not because everything was going smoothly." "The truth is that the Paris conference reached an agreement only because the representatives of the Western countries abandoned the course they had always followed." Therefore, the purpose of those boastful statements is only "to conceal the weakness of their position and the failure of American foreign policy."

### 工人阶级国际团结进一步增强

　　工人阶级国际团结进一步增强
    工人阶级国际团结的活动，是过去一周中的显著事件。
    根据世界工联国际各业职工部临时筹委会的决定，国际制鞋与皮革业、国际五金业、国际纺织与缝纫业的职工部成立大会，已分别在哥特瓦尔德城、都灵和里昂举行。三个大会通过了各该职工部的会章，并选出了领导机构。国际采矿业职工部、国际木工与建筑器材业职工部及国际海员与码头业职工部，亦将于本月中旬分别在佛罗伦萨与米兰召开成立大会。上述各职工部的成立或行将成立，将使各国工人阶级的团结进一步加强。从今以后，各国的各业中央职工会，不但可以经过世界工联而间接地取得连系，并且可以在各业职工部中直接地互相接触了。不仅如此，这些职工部成立以后，更可使世界工联的保卫世界民主和平的斗争，与各国工人的切身利益具体地结合起来，从而将大大提高世界工联在工人阶级中的影响和威信。
    工人阶级国际团结的最重要事件，是六月二十九日世界职工联盟第二届代表大会的揭幕。在举行世界工联大会的米兰艺术宫中，“劳动人民的国际团结万岁！”“各民族间的巩固与持久和平万岁！”的口号震响着。在开幕日，世界工联代理主席维特里奥向大会发表了重要演说，世界工联总书记赛扬作了关于世界工联活动的总报告。大会还要听取许多个别报告，其中包括关于亚洲职工会活动的报告。大会将选举世界工联的领导机关。中国人民庆贺这个世界工人阶级团结大会的召开，并预祝大会的成功。由于意大利反动政府的阻挠，中国职工代表团未能进入意境参加世界工联代表大会。前此，法国反动政府亦曾阻挠中国代表团赴里昂出席国际纺织与缝纫业职工部的成立大会。对于意法政府的这种反动行为，中国职工代表团已向该两国政府提出严重抗议。中国代表团团长刘宁一并在布拉格发表声明称：“我们保证和各国工人阶级的团结一致，保证全力支持世界工联。我们确信：世界工人阶级及其共同事业的胜利前进，绝不是任何反动势力所能阻挡的。”
    世界工联是历史上第一次把不同国家、不同种族、不同宗教的广大职工团结在一起的真正的国际工人组织。它团结着包括五十二个国家的六千五百万有组织的职工。世界工联自一九四五年成立以来，经过了相当曲折的道路。美英的反动工会领袖曾经参加了世界工联。他们原来想要从内部来夺取世界工联的领导权，以便使世界工联成为替垄断资本家和马歇尔计划服务的工具。可是，这个计划失败了，他们狼狈地退出了世界工联。他们曾经希望以退出来削弱和破坏世界工联，但是，这个阴谋也失败了。在他们退出以后，世界工联不是削弱了，而是加强了。自从加莱和狄金一月退出世界工联以后，日本、德国、突尼西亚、菲律宾、智利、巴拿马、蒙古和南朝鲜的进步工会，已经或者正准备参加世界工联。而世界工联各业职工部也建立起来了，这本是世界工联会章上早已规定了的，但由于美英工贼从中阻碍，曾久久未能实行。
    当美英反动工会领袖的阴谋诡计一个接着一个被打碎以后，他们于六月二十五、二十六两日在日内瓦召开了所谓“国际职工会联合会”的筹备会，并准备在十一月正式建立反动的“国际”职工组织，企图从外部来破坏世界工联，破坏国际工人运动的团结。但是，在世界工人阶级进一步团结面前，他们的这种卑劣企图，必将和过去一样，继续遭受失败。
    意大利二百万农业工人的大罢工，在英勇坚持三十六天之后，已于六月二十三日胜利结束。农业工人在自己的团结斗争和全意工人阶级的有力支援下，粉碎了政府与地主的一切进攻，迫使它们接受了农业工人在工资、失业保险等方面的要求，并同意与农业工人订立意国历史上第一个单一的全国性的合同。因此，以要求经济权利开始的农业工人罢工的胜利，同时具有重大的政治意义。在意大利阶级斗争日益尖锐化的今天，农业工人大罢工的胜利，正如意共中央公报所指出“是意大利人民在争取正当要求的斗争中团结与坚定的辉煌范例。是人民力量的重大成就”。
    法国人民最近进行了几次新的斗争。六月十八日，巴黎举行二十万人的大示威，反对戴高乐企图进行法西斯政变的阴谋。六月十五日，一百万公务员举行了“警告大罢工”。六月二十六日，退伍军人组织了示威。此外，法国农民正进行斗争，阻止反动派用武力没收产品。法国商人也在抗议征收额外税收。
    朝鲜民主祖国联合阵线成立大会于六月二十五日至二十八日在平壤举行。参加成立大会的七、八十个南北朝鲜民主政党和公共团体，一致通过了共同的斗争纲领，并选出了联合阵线的中央委员会，以便更有效地领导全国范围的斗争。大会的成就和民主祖国阵线的建立，表明了全朝鲜人民力量的不可抗拒，它们已进一步团结起来，为朝鲜的民主、独立和统一而进行斗争；同时这也证明：美帝国主义分裂朝鲜和奴役朝鲜人民的政策，正遭受严重的失败。正如许宪在大会的政治报告中指出：朝鲜“已具有成为独立国家的一切必要条件”，“没有任何力量能够阻止朝鲜人民团结起来，共同建立一个独立的民主国家”。
    巴黎外长会议关于德国问题和奥国和约问题所获取的协议，受到全世界进步舆论的一致欢迎。进步舆论指出：外长会议最重要的结果，是分裂德国、恶化国际关系的政策之毫无疑问的失败，是恢复德国统一、改善国际关系、谋求国际合作的政策之毫无疑问的成功。可是，关于外长会议的结果，美国官方却发表了别有用心的声明。美总统杜鲁门和国务卿艾奇逊硬说，巴黎的协议“证明”美国在外交政策上所遵循的“路线正确”，这是西方国家的“坚定政策”的结果，是马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约的结果。美国官方的这一声明，受到苏外长维辛斯基的驳斥和苏联舆论的揭发。真理报指出，那些先生们“不得不采取自诩的办法，并不是因为万事顺利”。“真实的情况是：巴黎会议之所以达成协议，只是因为西方国家的代表们放弃了他们一向遵循的路线的结果”。因此，那些自吹自擂的声明，其目的只是“在于掩饰他们地位的虚弱和美国外交政策的失败”。
