Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 24th: TASS reports: July 21st marks the 9th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet regime in the three republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. In the short span of nine years, despite four years of brutal destruction by fascist bandits, the working people of the three republics, with the cooperation and assistance of the brotherly people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, have not only healed the wounds of war but have also undergone tremendous changes and achieved rapid development in politics, economy, and culture. Now, they are celebrating this great festival with brilliant achievements in post-war construction.

　　Chairman Bai Altan of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Estonia stated: In the four years since the war, not only has Estonia's destroyed industry been rebuilt, but many new factories have also been constructed. The current total industrial output has doubled compared to 1939. Most enterprises have reached the average monthly production level of 1950, the final year of the post-war five-year plan. Agriculture has also recovered. The total output of grain and potatoes has greatly exceeded pre-war levels. Livestock breeding and the productivity of livestock products have rapidly developed and improved. The republic now has three thousand collective farms, with collective farm households accounting for 71 percent of the nation's farm households. The development of a national form of popular culture with socialist content is also significant. The republic has begun implementing a seven-year compulsory education system, and the number of children enrolled in schools has greatly exceeded pre-war levels. Estonia now has its own Academy of Sciences, including twelve research institutes. There are approximately seven hundred workers' and rural clubs, and hundreds of libraries, cinemas, children's welfare agencies, hospitals, general clinics, and medical stations throughout the country.

　　Chairman Lassis of the Council of Ministers of Latvia stated: Thanks to the assistance of the Soviet people, Latvia's industry restored its pre-war production levels two years ago. In the years since the war, industrial output has almost tripled. The vast majority of farmers have resolutely embarked on the path of the socialist collective farm system. The republic has more than three thousand eight hundred collective farms, uniting 82 percent of the nation's farm households. In the cultural field, Latvia now has an Academy of Sciences that includes seventeen research institutes. Institutions of higher education, specialized schools, and secondary schools are undergoing widespread expansion.

　　Lithuania has also achieved tremendous economic progress in the Soviet era, especially after the war. Several metal manufacturing factories have been restored and rebuilt. Confectionery, clothing, weaving, and tobacco factories have greatly exceeded pre-war production levels. Since the war, many factories have been equipped with thousands of the most modern Soviet-made machine tools and other machinery. Various industries are manufacturing two hundred new types of goods: water boilers, generators, metal cutting machines, and oxygen, etc. In agriculture, more than four thousand collective farms have been established. By utilizing advanced Soviet scientific methods, grain yields have increased by 20 to 30 percent. In terms of cultural life, in just a few years after the war, 1,500 books have been published, with a total circulation of over 20 million copies. The number of schools has quadrupled compared to pre-war levels. One out of every three people in the republic is in school. More than three thousand clubs, reading rooms, libraries, and cultural centers have been established in rural areas.
