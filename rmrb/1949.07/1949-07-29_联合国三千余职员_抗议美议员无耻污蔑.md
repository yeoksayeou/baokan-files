Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 28th: Chenggong Lake Dispatch: The Personnel Committee of the United Nations, representing 3,072 staff members of the UN Secretariat, unanimously passed a resolution on the 25th, protesting the slander of UN staff by US legislators. The resolution stated: The repeated "espionage" slanders against UN staff during congressional hearings are "unforgivable acts" attempting to interfere with UN affairs. The UN Personnel Committee expressed indignation at the repeated slander that the UN is a "back door for spies" and felt particularly indignant at the anonymous slander published by the US Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on July 22, saying that UN staff are being "threatened by communist agents."

　　联合国三千余职员
  　抗议美议员无耻污蔑
    【新华社北平二十八日电】成功湖讯：联合国人事委员会代表联合国秘书处三千零七十二名职员，于二十五日一致通过决议，抗议美国议员对联合国职员的污蔑。该决议称：在美国国会举证时一再对联合国职员加以“间谍的”污蔑，这是企图干涉联合国事务的“不可饶恕的行为”。联合国人事委员会对多次污蔑联合国是“间谍进来的后门”，表示愤慨，对于七月二十二日美参院司法小组委员会所发表的匿名污蔑，说联合国职员受到“共产党代理人的威胁”特别感到义愤。
