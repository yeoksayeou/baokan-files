　　Chapter Sixteen: Love and Hate (Continued 1)
    Someone came to find Zhang Jinlong, saying, "The battalion commander asks you to go over immediately." Zhang Jinlong came to the Catholic Church and met He Shixiong in the Western-style house behind the big watchtower. Commander Guiban had just left. He Shixiong discussed the Japanese plan with Zhang Jinlong, and also said that recently there had been letters from Zhang Yinwu's side, wanting to organize a "Kuomintang Vanguard Army" to attack the "bandit area," establish grassroots organizations, assassinate cadres, and prepare to "recover lost territory." The horizontal flesh on He Shixiong's face moved, and he said with a smile, "The Japanese trust us very much. For this job, each person gets an activity fee of 10,000 yuan a day, not including Zhang Yinwu's side. Do a good job!" As he spoke, he took out a stack of Joint Reserve Bank notes and told him to take them to spend first. This was exactly what Zhang Jinlong wanted; he patted his chest and said, "You can't go wrong leaving this matter to me! You'll see later!" He Shixiong allocated him several people, issued weapons, and instructed him on how to do it; Zhang Jinlong set off with his men.
    One day in May, Xiaomei went to the district to distribute military shoes, and in just two days, she received more than 100 pairs. That evening, she prepared to return to the county for a meeting, bundling up the shoes she had collected first and carrying a bundle herself; Niu Dashui happened to be free, and he and the communications员 Wang Quan'er carried the remaining two bundles, sending her back.
    When they set off, it was already dark. There was no moon. Sparse stars shone, barely illuminating the path in the wilderness. As they walked and talked, Niu Dashui suddenly said in a low voice, "Don't make a sound! Look behind the grave mounds! What is that figure doing?" Xiaomei quietly asked, "Where?" Before Dashui could answer, they heard two shots from that side, and bullets flew straight towards them; Xiaomei felt a numbness in her arm, cried out "Ouch," and stumbled. Dashui quickly said, "Lie down!" More shots rang out from the other side, the bullets flying over their heads. Wang Quan'er was so angry that he muttered and cursed, "Where did these bastards come from! Damn it, I'll kill those sons of bitches!" and followed Dashui to return fire.
    They persisted for a while, and the district militia heard the gunfire and rushed over. The two dark figures behind the grave mounds scurried away and fled. Dashui and Wang Quan'er hurriedly looked at Xiaomei, and blood was flowing from her sleeve. Xiaomei gritted her teeth and said, "It's okay, it's okay! I was hit in the arm." The militia searched for a while but couldn't find anyone. Dashui supported Xiaomei, and the group returned, guessing that it must have been a traitor or spy firing a black gun. Fortunately, Xiaomei didn't injure a bone, and she was sent to the clinic for treatment that night.
    Six
    Not long after, another incident occurred.
    A militiaman named Xiaoxiaozi didn't have money to buy cigarettes, so he stole a chicken from the people and took it to the market to sell; he was discovered by Gao Tun'er. Gao Tun'er got angry at the time, slapped him, forced him to return the chicken, and apologize to the people. Xiaoxiaozi was angry, but didn't dare to say anything; after a few days, he pretended to be sick and went home. He wanted to get some money, so he borrowed a small boat to catch fish in the lake.
    That day the fog was very heavy, all around was a white expanse. He cast his net and was reeling it in when he heard someone shout, "Xiaoxiaozi, what are you doing fishing here?" Xiaoxiaozi looked up and saw Zhang Jinlong and someone he didn't recognize in a small boat coming out of the reeds. Xiaoxiaozi was very flustered, but he didn't dare to leave, so he had to bite the bullet and say, "Hey, I'm short on cash, so I'm trying to catch some fish to spend."
    Zhang Jinlong's boat came closer, and he chatted idly with him, asking why he wasn't at the militia and had come home to fish. Xiaoxiaozi didn't dare to hide anything and had to tell the truth. Zhang Jinlong looked at his fish basket and said with a smile, "How many fish can you catch working all day? Don't waste your energy! Come, come, I'll give you some pocket money!" Xiaoxiaozi didn't dare not accept it. Zhang Jinlong said, "We're brothers, we don't distinguish between each other, take it and spend it!" Xiaoxiaozi wanted to ask him what he was up to, but he didn't dare to ask. Zhang Jinlong gave him the money, and they rowed away.
    For three days in a row, Xiaoxiaozi didn't dare to go out. That night, Zhang Jinlong brought a person and suddenly came to find Xiaoxiaozi. Xiaoxiaozi knew that he was a weasel visiting a chicken, up to no good; but he couldn't not receive him. Zhang Jinlong said a few words of small talk to him, then quietly told him that the Eighth Route Army wouldn't last long, and the Japanese soldiers and the constabulary were about to come and sweep through the area, and they were also going to build watchtowers in this village to kill anti-Japanese cadres and members of the district militia. Xiaoxiaozi believed it was true and said in fear, "What should we do?" Zhang Jinlong smiled and said, "Don't be afraid! Others can't escape, but you'll be fine, as long as you keep in touch with me, I'll insure you!" He left Xiaoxiaozi a few boxes of cigarettes and left.
    The next night, Zhang Jinlong came again, saying, "Xiaoxiaozi, don't suffer this poverty! Let's organize a group of people, rob a road, or something; we can also look for opportunities to kill cadres, expand our guns, and get rewarded by the Japanese. What do you say?" Xiaoxiaozi said, "I... I'll think about it." Before leaving, Zhang Jinlong said, "Brother, if it weren't for my friendship with you, I wouldn't say this. Think about it, there are many benefits in it. But there's one thing, if you expose me, don't expect your whole family, big and small, to live!" After he left, Xiaoxiaozi calculated and calculated, and dared not do it, and dared not expose it.
    The fourth time Zhang Jinlong found Xiaoxiaozi, he asked, "Have you decided? Are you going or not?" Xiaoxiaozi was contaminated by him, and there was no way out, so he had to say, "You organize first, and when it's almost ready, I'll go." Zhang Jinlong grabbed him and wouldn't let go; he immediately gave Xiaoxiaozi the task of developing people. Xiaoxiaozi agreed to slowly look for targets.
    Two days later, Zhang Jinlong came to find Xiaoxiaozi again. He had just drunk alcohol, and his eyes were red. He asked Xiaoxiaozi, "How are the people you're developing?" Xiaoxiaozi said, "I haven't found anyone who's right for it yet, I'm afraid if I say it wrong, it'll ruin things!" Zhang Jinlong glared his eyes and said, "You're really useless! Humph, you don't look like a good seed! Forget it, forget it, you can look for them later; we're going to start tomorrow!" Xiaoxiaozi timidly asked, "How are we going to do it?" Zhang Jinlong's face stretched even longer, and that murderous aura was very intimidating; he lowered one eyebrow and said fiercely, "Tch! This time we're all prepared, we're going to smash the district office, kill Gao Tun'er, capture Niu Dashui alive, and wipe out those bastards... Xiaoxiaozi, come with us tomorrow night, let's clean them up!"
    Xiaoxiaozi was frightened, but pretended that nothing was wrong and said, "Oh, I didn't bring back my gun, can I go empty-handed?" Zhang Jinlong said, "Tch, I'll give you two hand grenades!" He casually took out two Japanese-made hand grenades and gave them to Xiaoxiaozi. Xiaoxiaozi asked, "How are we going to do it? Who are all of our people?" Zhang Jinlong, drunk but not confused, said cunningly, "You don't need to worry about the others; just wait until tomorrow night, when the three stars are due south, you wait under the big willow tree by the water pit in the east of Huanghua Village, and someone will come to call you then. He'll clap three times as a signal, and you follow him to the assembly." He also said, "Xiaoxiaozi, you know me, if you do a good job, you'll get your benefits when things are done; if you ruin my business, don't blame me for being ruthless!" Saying that, he dropped a few banknotes and hurriedly left.
    Xiaoxiaozi didn't sleep all night, his heart was in turmoil; he didn't even eat breakfast, just lay on the kang, his head was burning. At noon, Dashui and Gao Tun'er came to see him, carrying noodles and chicken. Dashui saw that Xiaoxiaozi's face looked very bad and asked with concern, "Xiaoxiaozi, is your illness better? You look much thinner these days!" Gao Tun'er grabbed Xiaoxiaozi's hand and said sadly, "Ai, Xiaoxiaozi, I have a firecracker temper, when I get angry, I can't control myself, and I regret it afterwards! Dashui and the others criticized me, I admit I was wrong to hit you, don't take it to heart!"
    Xiaoxiaozi listened, tears streaming down his face, and said, "Captain, don't say that, it's all my fault! I know in my heart... I... I'm really sorry to you!" Xiaoxiaozi was sick at heart, and when he said this, he choked up and couldn't continue, crying even more sadly. Dashui and Gao Tun'er felt very bad in their hearts and hurriedly comforted him, saying, "Everyone has shortcomings, as long as they correct them, that's good. Take good care of yourself, and when your body is strong, go back to work." They also said, "If you have any difficulties, just say it; we will definitely find a way to help you. The comrades care about you very much, and they all want to come and see you!" Xiaoxiaozi said there were no difficulties. They comforted him for a while, then stood up and said, "We still have a meeting tonight, we'll come and see you again in a few days." After giving him a few more instructions, they walked out.
    Xiaoxiaozi felt hot and spicy in his heart. Thinking of these good people, who were about to suffer at the hands of these villians, and they still don't know it, how could he not tell them? His blood rushed up for a moment, and he couldn't care about anything else, he jumped off the kang and chased after them barefoot to the gate and pulled them back. Dashui and Gao Tun'er were very strange, asking him what was the matter. He was afraid and anxious, and told them everything while crying.
    Seven
    Dashui and Gao Tun'er returned to the district and secretly discussed with District Chief Jiao. At first, they wanted to have Xiaoxiaozi follow the spy to the assembly, and their people would aim from afar, as long as they knew the assembly point, they could go and arrest them. But they were afraid that they would act as soon as they assembled, and there wouldn't be time to surround them; and they were afraid of being discovered by the spy while following. In the end, they decided to capture the spy first, and then question him about the assembly point.
    Xiaoxiaozi secretly came to the district office. Dashui and Gao Tun'er told him the plan, and he trembled with fear and dared not go. They persuaded him for a while, and came up with a plan, and Xiaoxiaozi reluctantly agreed.
    When the three stars were due south, the district militia had already prepared and were waiting for news. Xiaoxiaozi was squatting under the willow tree by the pit. After a while, a figure came hesitantly, lightly clapping three times. Xiaoxiaozi stood up and clapped three times as well. The man walked over with a Mauser pistol, and asked, "Are you Xiaoxiaozi?" Xiaoxiaozi said, "Yes. Where are we going?" The man said, "Follow me."
    Dashui and Gao Tun'er suddenly jumped out, pointing their guns at them, saying, "Don't shout! If you shout, I'll kill you! Put down your gun!" The spy said, "Okay, here's the gun!" He flung his arm and fired a shot at them, then turned and ran.
    Dashui and Gao Tun'er chased after him, seeing the spy running towards the wheat field, and they were about to lose him, they anxiously opened fire. The guy was hit by three shots and died on the edge of the wheat field.
    Dashui, Gao Tun'er, and the district militia searched everywhere, but Zhang Jinlong's gang of political bandits were frightened by the gunfire and had already run away.

　　新儿女英雄传
    袁静　孔厥
　　第十六回　爱和仇（续一）
    有人来找张金龙，说：“大队长请你马上过去。”张金龙来到天主堂，在大岗楼后面的洋房里，见到何世雄。龟板司令刚走。何世雄把日本人的计划跟张金龙谈了，又说最近张荫梧那边也有信来，要组织“国民党先遣军”，打进“匪区”，建立下层组织，暗杀干部，准备“收复失地”。何世雄脸上的横肉一动，笑着说：“日本人很信任我们，干这差事，每一个人一天就有一万块钱的活动费，张荫梧那边的还不在内。你好好儿干吧！”说着，掏出一叠联合票，叫他先拿去花。这可正对张金龙的心眼儿；他拍着胸脯说：“这事交给我没错儿！往后你瞧吧！”何世雄给他拨了几个人，又发了武器，指示了办法；张金龙带着人，就出发了。
    五月的一天，小梅到区上发动作劳军鞋，只两天工夫，就收到一百多双。这天傍黑，她准备回县开会，把先收的鞋捆扎好，自己背了一捆；剩下两捆，牛大水刚好有空，和通讯员王圈儿两个背着，送她回去。
    起身的时候，天已经黑了。没有月亮。稀朗朗的星星照着，野地里刚辨清个道儿。他们一边走，一边谈着话，忽然牛大水低声说：“别言声儿！看坟堆后面！那个人影儿干什么的？”小梅悄悄问：“在哪儿？”大水还没来得及答话，就听见那边叭叭的响了两枪，子弹直朝这边飞来；小梅觉得胳膊一麻，哎哟一声，闪了一个踉跄。大水忙说：“快爬下！”那边又响枪，子弹从头上飞过去。气得王圈儿嘟囔着骂：“哪儿来的坏种呀！妈的，打他王八羔子！”就跟着大水还枪打。
    他们坚持了一阵，区小队听见枪声，急忙跑来，坟堆后面那两个黑影儿窜着逃了。大水王圈儿忙看小梅，血从她袖口里流了出来。小梅咬着牙说：“不碍不碍！打在胳膊上了。”小队搜索了一会，没找着人。大水扶着小梅，一伙人就回来，猜想准是汉奸特务打的黑枪。幸亏小梅没伤着骨头，当天晚上就送卫生所医治去了。
    六
    隔了不久，又发生一件事。
    区小队队员小小子没钱买烟卷儿，他偷了老百姓一只鸡，拿到集上去卖；给高屯儿发现了。高屯儿一时起火，打了他一巴掌，逼着他送回鸡，还给老百姓道了歉。小小子气不过，又不敢说什么；过了几天，就装病回家。他想弄几个钱，借了个小船到淀里去罩鱼。
    这天雾很大，四下里白茫茫的。他把网儿撒了出来，正往怀里收，听见有人喊：“小小子，你怎么在这儿治鱼呢？”小小子抬头一看，瞧见张金龙和一个不认得的人坐了一条小船儿，从苇塘里出来。小小子心里很着慌，可又不敢走，只好硬着头皮说：“嗨，手边挺紧，想捞摸两个钱儿花。”
    张金龙的船儿靠拢来，和他扯闲话，盘问他为什么不在小队上，要回家来治鱼。小小子不敢隐瞒，只好照实说了。张金龙看着他的鱼篓子，笑着说：“你忙活一天，能弄多少鱼呀？别瞎费劲儿啦！来来来，我送你几个零花钱！”小小子不敢不接。张金龙说：“咱哥儿俩不分你我，拿上花吧！”小小子想问他这会儿干什么勾当，又不敢问。张金龙给了钱，他们划着船儿走了。
    一连三天，小小子不敢出门。这天晚上，张金龙带了个人，突然来找小小子。小小子知道他黄鼠狼给鸡拜年，没安好心眼儿；可又不能不接待他，张金龙跟他说了几句家常话，就悄悄儿告诉他说，八路军长不了，日本兵和警备队快要来扫荡了，还要在这村修岗楼，杀抗日干部和区小队的队员。小小子信以为真，害怕的说：“那怎么办？张金龙笑着说：“你别害怕！旁人逃不了，你不碍，只要你常跟我联系着点儿，我给你保上险！”他给小小子留下几盒烟，就走了。
    第二天晚上，张金龙又来了，说：“小小子，你别受这个穷罪啦！咱们组织上一拨人，劫个道儿，干个什么的；还可以瞅空子打干部，扩充些枪，在日本人那儿得功领赏。你说好不好？”小小子说：“我……我琢磨琢磨吧。”临走，张金龙说：“老弟，不是我同你的交情，说不到这儿。你想想吧，这里面的好处可多呢。可是有一桩，你要暴露了我，你一家子大大小小别想活着！”他走了以后，小小子盘算来，盘算去，又不敢干，又不敢暴露。
    第四次张金龙找小小子，问：“你决定了没有？去不去？”小小子跟他沾染上了，没办法，只好说：“你们先组织吧，差不多了我就去。”张金龙可攒住不撒手、叨住不松嘴了；他立时给小小子任务，叫他发展人。小小子答应慢慢儿瞅目标。
    过了两天，张金龙又来找小小子。他刚喝了酒，两只眼睛都喝红了。他问小小子：“你发展的人怎么样了？”小小子说：“我还没找到对眼儿的呢，怕说不好，坏了事儿！”张金龙瞪着眼睛说：“你真不中用！哼，看你就不是个人种子！算了算了，你以后再找吧；咱们明天就要动手了！”小小子胆怯的问：“咱们怎么弄呢？”张金龙脸儿拉得更长了，那一股杀气很森人；他压低一条眉毛，凶狠狠的说：“哧！这一回咱们什么都准备好了，就要砸他区公所，打死高屯儿，活捉牛大水，把那些王八蛋操的一网打尽…小小子，明晚上你一块儿去，咱们拾掇他个痛快！”
    小小子听得心惊肉跳，装着没事儿似的说：“嗳呀，我的枪也没带回来，空着手儿也能去呀？”张金龙说：“啐，给你两颗手榴弹！”他随手掏出两个日本造的手榴弹，给了小小子。小小子问：“怎么个干法呢？咱们的人都有些谁？”张金龙酒醉心不醉，狡猾的说：“旁的你不用管；只等明天夜里，看三星正南了，你就在黄花村村东，水坑边的大柳树底下等着，到时候就会有人来叫你。他和你拍三声巴掌为号，你就跟着他来集合。”又说：“小小子，我这个人你也知道，你要好好儿干，事情成了，自有你的好处；你要坏了我的事儿，可别怨我手黑！”说着，丢下几张票子，匆匆忙忙的去了。
    小小子一夜没睡着，心里上上下下，堵着一块疙瘩儿；早起饭也没吃，只是躺在炕上，脑瓜儿直发烧。晌午，大水高屯儿来看他，手里拿着挂面鸡子儿。大水瞧见小小子脸上颜色很不好看，挺关心的问：“小小子，你的病好了没有？我看你这几天瘦多啦！”高屯儿一把抓住小小子的手，难过的说：“唉，小小子，我这个人就是炮仗脾气，一时火儿上来了，由不得自己，过后又卖后悔药！大水他们批评我，我承认我打你不对，你可别放在心上！”
    小小子听了，眼泪直流，说：“队长，你别那么说了，都是我不好！我心里知道……我……我实在对不起你们啊！”小小子心里有病，说到这儿，喉咙里哽得说不下去，更恸的哭起来了。哭得大水高屯儿心里怪难受，忙安慰他说：“谁也有缺点，只要改过来就好啦。你好好儿养病，等身体养结实了，再去工作。”又说：“你有什么困难，你就说；咱们一定想办法帮助。同志们挺关心你，都想来看你呢！”小小子说没困难。他俩又安慰一阵，就站起来说：“今晚上还要开会，过两天再来看你吧。”又叮咛了几句，他俩就走出去了。
    小小子心里热辣辣的“想想这些好人，眼看着就要遭毒手了，他们可还蒙在鼓里呢，怎么能不说给他们呀？他一时血往上涌，什么也顾不得了，猛的从炕上跳下，光着脚儿追到大门口，拉他们回来。大水高屯儿很奇怪，问他是什么事。他又是害怕，又是着急，哭着把什么事儿都说了。
    七
    大水高屯儿回到区上，和焦区长暗暗商量。开头他们想叫小小子跟着那个特务去集合，咱们的人远远的瞄着，只要知道他们集合的地点，就可以去抓。可是怕他们一集合就动作，来不及包围；又怕跟着的时候给特务发觉。最后就决定先抓住那个特务，再盘问集合的地点。
    小小子偷偷的到区公所来了。大水高屯儿把计划告诉他，他吓得发抖，不敢去。他们劝了一阵，又给想了个办法，小小子才勉强答应了。
    三星正南的时候，区小队早准备好，等着信儿。小小子在坑边柳树底下蹲着。一会儿，一个人影探头探脑的来了，轻轻拍了三下巴掌。小小子站起来，也拍了三下。那人提着盒子枪走过来，问：“你是小小子？”小小子说：“是。往哪儿去呀？”那人说：“你跟我走吧。”
    大水高屯儿猛的跳出来，用枪指着他两个，说：“别嚷！嚷就打死你！快放下枪！”那个特务说：“好，给你枪！”他把胳膊一甩，朝这边打了一枪，转身就跑。
    大水高屯儿跟屁股就追，眼看着那特务往麦子地奔，快要抓不住了，急得他俩忙开枪。那家伙中了三枪，死在麦地边上了。
    大水高屯儿和区小队到处搜索，可是张金龙那一伙政治土匪，听到枪声，早吓跑了。
    （未完）
