　　Second Day of National Congress of Literary and Art Workers
  　Guo Moruo Reports on Building New Literature and Art
    Workers Demand Literary and Art Workers Go to Factories to Reflect Workers' Lives and Help with Study
    [Ping City News] Yesterday was the second day of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, chaired by Ding Ling. Guo Moruo gave a general report entitled "Striving to Build the People's Literature and Art of New China." He explained the nature of the new literature and art movement and the united front issue in literary and art circles, and put forward the tasks for national literary and art work in the future (full text in another article). During the conference, two workers were invited to speak. Xu Shirong, a female worker from the Clothing General Factory, asked literary and art workers to go to the factories, reflect their lives more, and help them study. She said that it is not difficult for intellectuals to integrate with workers, and that if workers, peasants, soldiers, and intellectuals unite like a fist, they will definitely be able to build a new democratic society well. Li Jiazhong, a technician from the 70th Ordnance Factory, asked everyone to use more practical actions to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. He said that the "Red Flag Song" was very popular in their factory; the task of turning workers like Sister Ma Fen in the "Red Flag Song" into activists and restoring and developing production can be completed quickly. After the two workers spoke, the poet Ke Zhongping took the stage and recited his new poem commemorating July 1st, "Creating an Industrial Country, Workers Dare to Insure." Before the meeting ended, literary and art workers from the liberated areas stood up to pay tribute to literary and art workers who had struggled arduously under the oppression of the reactionaries in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

　　全国文代大会第二日
  　郭沫若报告建设新文艺
    工人要求文艺工作者到工厂去多反映工人生活和帮助学习
    【平市讯】昨天是全国文代大会第二日，由丁玲主席。郭沫若作总报告，题目是“为建设新中国的人民文艺而奋斗”。他说明新文艺运动的性质和文艺界的统一战线问题，并提出今后全国文艺工作的任务（全文见另文）。在大会进行中，有两位工人被邀请讲话。被服总厂的女工徐士荣要求文艺工作者到工厂去，多反映他们的生活，帮助他们的学习。他说知识分子和工人结合并不是很困难的，工农兵和知识分子团结起来，象一个拳头一样，一定就能够把新民主主义社会建设的很好。七○兵工厂的技工李家忠要求大家多用实际的行动来为工农兵服务。他说“红旗歌”在他们工厂演出，很受欢迎；要把“红旗歌”里面的马芬姐那样的工人变成积极分子，恢复生产发展生产的任务才能很快完成。两位工人讲话后，诗人柯仲平登台朗诵他纪念七一的新诗，“创造工业国，工人敢保险”。会议结束前，解放区的文艺工作者特起立向曾经在国统区反动派压迫下艰苦奋斗的文艺工作者致敬。
