Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th — Nanjing Xinhua Daily recently published an editorial calling for "Practicing Strict Economy and Retrenchment." The editorial stated: Because we took over the Kuomintang's large and bloated bureaucratic structure, and did not immediately implement streamlining and pay attention to economy, the organs are large, the staffing is not reasonable, and many public enterprises also generally have too many redundant personnel and overlapping institutions. Some comrades who came from the liberated areas seriously lack a war perspective and a mass perspective after entering the city. They do not advocate that one person do the work of two people, but often pursue as many staff members as possible. On the other hand, they do not cherish state property enough. Many public buildings and equipment have been damaged, and some materials have been damaged and corroded because they are unattended. The waste of water, electricity, and transportation equipment in various agencies is very large. The editorial pointed out: If all these phenomena are not changed, we will encounter many difficulties in finance and will not be able to restore and develop production well. Especially this year, serious floods and droughts have occurred in many areas, and the lives of farmers are quite difficult. If we do not practice strict economy and retrenchment to reduce the huge financial burden of farmers on cities, there will be no way to improve the relationship between urban and rural areas. The editorial continued: In order to smash the blockade of the liberated areas by imperialism and its running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, to improve the relationship between urban and rural areas to achieve a balance of payments, and then actively accumulate capital for the restoration and development of production, we must: reduce staffing, transfer a group of cadres, and distribute them to the countryside in a planned way to strengthen rural work. And reduce non-essential personnel, and strive for a lean organization. Advocate the concept of labor, advocate strengthening work efficiency, and encourage one person to do the work of two people. In the streamlining work, old personnel should be persuaded to understand the difficulties of the people and do their best to transfer to production. In the streamlining of factories and enterprises, it is necessary to strictly check the various corrupt personnel arrangements of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, which are based on personal relationships and even completely unrelated to production, and strive to rationalize the production organization. The editorial called on all organs, factories, and schools in Nanjing to immediately launch a savings campaign. Factories and enterprises should conscientiously achieve reasonable staffing, save electricity, fuel, raw materials, equipment, etc.; actively improve technology, give play to the creativity of the proletariat, rely on local materials and use waste materials without foreign aid, and care for machines and reduce losses to achieve the goal of reducing costs and increasing production. All organs and schools should strictly implement the regulations of the East China Bureau of the CPC to stop the waste of water, electricity, automobiles, etc. Businesses that can be temporarily postponed should rather not be done; hospitality should be as simple as possible, all gatherings should be simple, and extravagance should be avoided; all personnel of various organs should strictly implement the meal ticket system; and those who can save this year's winter clothes should automatically save them. Salary-system employees should be encouraged to reduce a little automatically without affecting their lives. The materials of each unit should be cleaned up once, and the responsibility for losses should be strictly investigated. In addition, all organs should make efforts to grow vegetables in situations where wasteland and barren land can be utilized to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables.
