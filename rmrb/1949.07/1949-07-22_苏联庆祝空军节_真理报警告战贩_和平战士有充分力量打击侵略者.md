Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 21st: Moscow dispatch: Pravda published an editorial on the Soviet Air Force Day on July 17th, stating: Russia is the birthplace of aviation. The Soviet Union was the first to make discoveries and inventions of significant importance in aviation. However, only after the great October Socialist Revolution, only after the people had seized power in their own hands, and as a result of fulfilling the Stalin Five-Year Plan, did our country become a powerful air force nation. Pravda stated: The Bolshevik Party carried out tremendous organizational work during the years of the Great Patriotic War, using all its strength to build the Soviet Air Force. The Soviet Air Force has proven to be immeasurably superior to the German Air Force in terms of the operational performance of aircraft and the training and technology of personnel.

Pravda pointed out that when the current international reactionaries are plotting a criminal crusade of aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries: those warmongers who exaggerate the possibilities of this plan, their cannibalistic, misanthropic madness, cannot intimidate the fighters defending socialism and democracy. The Soviet people are confident in their own strength and know that warmongers have a long way to go from planning a new war to launching a new war; and the warriors of peace have sufficient strength to contain the aggressors and will inflict direct blows on those thugs who dare to try to plunge mankind into the bloody disaster of war. Pravda declared: There is nothing new in the reactionary newspapers' mad threats. The mad Hitler, in his heyday, also threatened to "eliminate Soviet cities from the face of the earth." However, in three years, 75,000 German aircraft were crushed on Soviet soil, turning into piles of broken, shapeless metal. It would be good for "warmongering" gentlemen, such as the hacks in the New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune who advocate sending American planes to other countries, to remember this often.

### 苏联庆祝空军节　真理报警告战贩  和平战士有充分力量打击侵略者

　　苏联庆祝空军节
  　真理报警告战贩
    和平战士有充分力量打击侵略者
    【新华社北平二十一日电】莫斯科讯：真理报在七月十七日苏联空军节发表社论称：俄罗斯是航空学的出生地。苏联在航空方面最先作了具有显著重要性的发现与发明。但是，只有在伟大的十月社会主义革命之后，只有在人民已把政权掌握在他们手中之后，并且由于履行了斯大林五年计划的结果，我们的国家才成为强大的空军国家。真理报声称：布尔什维克党在伟大爱国战争的年代，曾进行了巨大的组织工作，用全力建立苏联的空军。苏联空军在飞机机器的作战性能与人员的训练和技术上，都已证明比德国空军优越得不可衡量。
    真理报指出目前国际反动派在策划反对苏联与人民民主国家的侵略十字军的罪恶计划时称：那些夸张这个计划的可能性的战争贩子，他们的嗜食人肉的憎恨人类的癫狂，恫吓不了保卫社会主义与民主的斗士。苏联人民确信自己的力量，并且知道：战争贩子从计划新战争到发动新战争，要走一条长远的路程；而和平的战士，则有充分的力量去遏制侵略者，并将以直接的打击，加于那些敢于企图把人类陷入血腥战争大灾难的棍徒们。真理报宣称：反动报纸癫狂的威胁，并没有什么新的东西。癫狂的希特勒，在其全盛时期也曾威胁着要“把苏联的城市从地球上消灭掉”。但是，在三年当中，有七万五千架德国飞机，被粉碎在苏联的土地上，变成一堆堆破烂的不成形的金属。在纽约时报和纽约先驱论坛报上主张派遣美国飞机到别国的文丐之类的“好战”绅士，如若时常地记得这件事，那对他们是会有好处的。
