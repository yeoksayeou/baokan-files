    【平市讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会于十二日上午九时在北平西郊举行第一期保育干部训练班开学典礼。朱总司令，民主妇联蔡畅、李德全正副主席，人民解放军总部后勤部卫生部傅连璋副部长等和来宾二十余人，皆前往参加。由该会妇女儿童福利部康克清部长任主席，报告训练班成立经过、学习课程计划后，朱总司令勉励全体学员，努力改造自私的个人主义观念，处处为孩子，为人民大众，为建设新社会着想，大家动手保育儿童。蔡畅同志指出今日的训练班规模虽小，但本“从无到有，从小到大”，从不科学到科学的原则，由于社会的需要和保育事业的大众化，从旧的慈善观点转变过来，把它看成革命的终身事业，遇到困难不回头，将来的发展是不可限量的。李德全先生勉励大家把母爱扩大到大众的孩子身上，从乳儿幼儿开始，即应注意依照儿童发育各阶段的需要，给以各种语言，视觉，听觉的教育和体格的锻炼，使托儿所的孩子们成为身体健康，头脑灵敏，精神活泼的后代。傅连璋部长则指出保育工作者要有医生那样始终如一为事业而努力的精神和技能，并保证卫生部在可能范围内及时给以帮助。后由学员代表致答辞，表示“诚恳地接受首长们的指示，愿意改造自己的思想，努力学习，为新中国的保育事业服务。”最后全体呼口号并唱歌，大家尽欢而散。
