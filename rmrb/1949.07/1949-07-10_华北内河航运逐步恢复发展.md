　　[Tianjin Dispatch] The major inland waterway routes in North China are gradually recovering. Since its establishment, the North China Inland Waterway Transportation Administration has successively set up five offices in De County, Cang County, Linqing, Daqing River, and Tianjin. Currently, 2,000 ships on the Daqing River and the Grand Canal have completed registration. With the assistance of boat owners, boatmen, and farmers along the river, most of the wooden stakes, trees, and other obstacles in the river have been cleared, making navigation much more convenient than before. This work is still underway near Linqing. Since its establishment in mid-June, the Tianjin office of the Transportation Administration has initially and appropriately resolved some disputes between boat owners and boatmen, and between boat owners and cargo owners. In order to reorganize and organize ships to more systematically grasp and develop inland waterway transportation, the office will soon handle ship registration in the city. Boat owners who apply for registration and pass the examination will be issued a shipping license, which will allow them to travel on various inland waterways in North China.

　　华北内河航运逐步恢复发展
    【天津电】华北各主要内河航线正逐步恢复中。华北内河航运管理局自成立以来，已先后设立德县、沧县、临清、大清河、天津等五个办事处，现大清河及运河的船只，已有两千只完成登记；在船商船工及沿河农民的协助下，河里的木桩、树木及其他障碍物已大部清除，航行较前便利甚多。此项工作现仍在临清附近进行中。航运管理局天津办事处于六月中旬设立后，已初步适当地解决了船主与船工间及船主与货主间的某些纠纷；为了整理组织船只，以更有计划地掌握与发展内河航运，该办事处即将在本市办理船只登记工作，申请登记船商，经审查合格，发给航运证后，即可在华北各内河通行。
