　　Shijiazhuang Establishes
    Civil Engineering and Construction Cooperative
    [Shijiazhuang Electricity] The Shijiazhuang Cooperative Headquarters is implementing the spirit of the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Conference and is gradually organizing independent laborers in the city. Following the shoe industry's joint supply and marketing cooperative, a civil engineering and construction cooperative has also been established and is now open for business. As early as last year, carpenters and tilers in the city organized their own cooperatives and cooperative groups. The total number of organized members in the city is 290. However, because there was no connection between the cooperatives in the past, and the funds were very small, they could not design projects and calculate costs for bidding, and they could only rely on doing small odd jobs to maintain themselves. Small jobs could not solve the workers' regular work and life problems, so most of the organized members dispersed and went to private construction companies or worked as laborers. Recently, the Cooperative Headquarters, based on past experience and the needs of its members, convened a meeting of the heads of construction cooperatives to review and discuss solutions. It was unanimously agreed that the joint organization must be strengthened, and it was decided to establish a "Civil Engineering and Construction Cooperative," which would uniformly contract projects and purchase raw materials, and hire engineers to design projects. After half a month of preparation, it is now open for business. After the news of the establishment of the Joint Cooperative spread, carpenters and tilers came to the Cooperative Headquarters to inquire about the situation and requested to join the cooperative.

　　石家庄成立
    土木建筑联合社
    【石家庄电】石市合作总社贯彻华北供销合作会议精神，逐步将该市独立劳动者组织起来。继鞋业联合供销合作社之后，又成立土木建筑联合社，现已开始营业。按该市木瓦工人远在去年就分别组织自己的合作社与合作小组。全市有组织的社员共二百九十人。但因过去各社之间没有联系，资金又很少，自己不能设计工程和计算成本进行投标，只有靠作零碎的小活来维持，而小活又不能解决工人的经常工作和生活问题，于是已经组织起来的社员大都分散，投奔私人建筑公司或当小工。最近合作总社根据过去经验和社员的需要，召集建筑合作社的负责人开会检讨，并讨论解决办法，一致认为必须加强联合组织，决议成立“土木建筑联合社”，由联合社统一包揽工程采购原料，并聘请工程师设计工程。经过半月筹备，现已开始营业。联社成立消息传出后，木瓦工人纷往合作总社探询情况，并要求入社。
