Jilu Yu Cooperative Headquarters
　　Support Oil Pressing and Straw Braid Industries

　　[Jilu Yu Electric] The General Supply and Marketing Cooperative of this region has established close ties with state-owned trading organizations to support and develop industries such as oil pressing and straw braid making. They have mainly carried out the following tasks: (1) The Puyang Gongqiao Cooperative acquired products from four oil pressing groups, including Xingyuan Village, increasing their production by more than double. Now, due to sluggish sales of rapeseed oil, the trading company has decided to exchange rapeseed for its finished products, allowing the oil pressing groups to continue production; (2) Members in Gaoling, Weihe, and several other counties needed coal, so the General Cooperative negotiated with relevant parties to convert its coal reserves into grain at below-market prices, which was then loaned to the members; (3) Credit deposit and loan services were conducted with 150,000 jin of wheat to adjust the capital turnover of various industries; (4) For the straw braid industries in Qingfeng, Nanle, and Guancheng, the Tongfeng Braid Factory was invited to participate in guidance and provide assistance. At the same time, in order to improve quality, fine and uniform braids were purchased at prices higher than the market price. The above methods have not only powerfully maintained mass production but also assisted in the development of state-owned trade.

　　(Further Telegram) To strengthen the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperatives, the Zhinan District Committee transferred strong cadres to establish the Zhinan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Guidance Office. The General Cooperative is conducting key pilot projects in special districts such as Zhinan. In the past two months, eight county cooperatives and the Puyang Chengguan District Cooperative have been established, and preparations are now underway to rapidly establish district and branch cooperatives. The General Cooperative also plans to launch a region-wide cooperative building campaign in conjunction with the current large-scale production movement.

　　冀鲁豫合作总社
  　扶植榨油草帽辫业
    【冀鲁豫电】本区供销合作总社与国营贸易机关取得密切联系，扶植和发展榨油、草帽辫等业。它们主要进行了以下几个工作：（一）濮阳公桥合作社因收购杏园村等四个打油组的产品，使其生产提高了一倍以上。现以菜油销路不畅，贸易公司已决定以菜籽换其成品，使打油组继续生产；（二）高陵、卫河等数县社员需用煤，总社即与有关方面商妥，将其存煤按低于市价折成粮食，转贷社员；（３）以十五万斤小麦举办信用存贷业务，调剂各业的资金周转；（４）对清丰、南乐、观城的草帽辫业，请同丰辫庄参加指导并给以资助。同时为提高质量，对细辫、匀辫，以高于市价收购。以上办法，既有力保持了群众生产，又协助了国营贸易业务的开展。
    （又电）为加强供销社的领导，直南地委抽调强有力干部，成立直南专区供销合作社指导办事处。总社在直南等专区进行重点试办，两月来已建立了八个县社及濮阳城关区社，现正在准备迅速建立区社与分社。总社并计划结合当前大生产运动，开展全区建社工作。
