　　Transformation of Writing Thought
    Since listening to Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art
    Chen Xue Zhao
    The depth of my understanding and the degree of my implementation of the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech at the Forum on Literature and Art have progressed over a relatively long period, with the tempering of time and revolutionary practice.
    Initially, after the Forum, I completely negated my past writing, believing that what I had written before was purely venting personal emotions. Even if I had written a little about dissatisfaction with the old society, it was from a personal perspective and personal standpoint, and had virtually no connection with the revolution, workers, peasants, and soldiers. At that time, I was at a loss, not knowing where to start writing in the future, or how to start learning to write again, so that my writing could become a truly revolutionary undertaking. I also felt that writing was not easy, and the responsibility of literary and art workers was extremely heavy. These thoughts often revolved in my mind. The more these thoughts revolved, the less confidence I had in my writing future, and the more pessimistic I became. Looking back, the negation of my own writing and the temporary loss of confidence during that period were both understandable and inevitable; without negating the old and incorrect things, it would be difficult to absorb and cultivate new things.
    So how did my confidence in writing gradually increase later? First of all, I must thank the Party and the leading comrades for their help. The greatest and most numerous education and help initially came from the Liberation Daily. I will always remember Comrade Bogu (who has passed away), and I will always remember Comrade Lu Dingyi. Sometimes, when I heard them talk about their opinions on an article in the supplement editorial office, a word correction or a sentence addition or subtraction, I remembered their words very well, which gave me great enlightenment and education. The Party newspaper and these leading comrades gave me benefits that I will always cherish. In the past two years, modifying the works of worker and peasant comrades has also been very educational. Gradually, I have gained some confidence in my writing future, feeling that even if I cannot write anything good, as long as I am useful to worker and peasant comrades, and of some small use to the worker and peasant masses, it is very pleasant to be their literary barber.
    At the Labor Hero Conference in early 1945, I also participated in writing about labor heroes and model workers. This was the first time—after the Forum—that I came into contact with representatives of the working people. Listening to them talk about their heroic deeds gave me excitement and education, and made me feel that being able to pick up a pen for them, to record for them, was such a glorious thing! My confidence in writing grew even more. Later, I worked as a cultural instructor in the Fourth Department of the Party School, getting close to worker and peasant cadres every day and studying with them. Since then, I have become increasingly clear about my ideological state: as long as I am close to the worker and peasant masses, my confidence in writing grows, and my whole life becomes fresh and lively. If I am slightly away from them one day, I become dejected and feel annoyed. But I am still not brave enough or bold enough in writing. My pen is also very sluggish, and I can't keep up with some comrades in reflecting things in a timely manner. I am restrained, always considering things again and again until I see them clearly and understand them completely before daring to pick up the pen. For example, although I have done a little land reform, I have not dared to write even a short report article. In addition, there is also an idea of being original, which binds me even more, and I dare not write.
    Since "August 15th," in these past four years, I have been writing while marching or working, and my writing is my work and my learning. Naturally, I have not yet written anything that satisfies everyone or satisfies myself, but I am not discouraged at all. What I have is the determination to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, my confidence and desire for writing have never been so strong and full. This short period of entering the factory has further strengthened my determination and confidence.
    Finally, I should say how great and correct the literary policy indicated by Chairman Mao, the direction for workers, peasants, and soldiers, is! It was he, after his speech at the Forum, that I found my new writing life!

　　对于写作思想的转变
    自从听了毛主席的延安文艺界座谈会讲话以后
    陈学昭
    我对于毛主席座谈会上讲话的精神的体会深度和贯彻的程度，是经过了一个较长时间，随着时间和革命的实际锻炼而进展的。
    最初，当座谈会之后，我完全否定了自己过去的写作，认为以前写的东西纯粹是发泄个人情感，就使写了一点对旧社会的不满，那也是出于个人观点，个人立场的，对革命和工农兵简直是没有什么联系的。自己在那个时候是茫然的不知道今后应从何着手来从事写作，或者说怎样重新开始来学习写作，使自己的写作成为真正的一件革命事业。我又感到写作是不容易的，而文艺工作者的责任是异常重大的，这些思想常常来回地在我脑子里转着，这些思想转得愈多，我对自己写作的前途和信心就愈加少，愈加悲观。后来想起来，那一个时期对于自己写作的否定和一时的丧失信心，都是情理上说得通的必然经过的程度；如果没有对旧的不正确的东西给以否定，那么就很难吸收和培养起新的东西来的。
    那么后来，我对写作的信心又怎样渐渐地增加起来的呢？首先是要感谢党和领导同志给我的帮助。最初给我教育和帮助最大最多的是解放日报。我会永远记得博古同志（已经过世），我也永远记得陆定一同志，当有时在副刊编辑室里听到他们谈对于一篇文章的意见，一个字的改正或一句话的增减上，他们的片言只字，我都记得很牢，给我很大的启示和教育，党报和这几位领导同志给我的好处是我永远珍贵着的。在近两年的修改工农同志的作品中，给我的教育也很大，渐渐地对自己的写作前途有些信心，觉得即使写不出什么好东西，只要使自己对工农同志有用，对工农大众有些小用处，做他们文字上的理发员也是很愉快的。
    一九四五年年初的劳动英雄大会，我也去参加写劳动英雄和模范工作者，这是第一次——座谈会以后——我去和劳动人民的代表接触，听着他们谈他们英勇的事迹，给我兴奋也给我教育，并且使我觉得还能拿起笔来，为他们写，为他们记录，是多么光荣的事情！对写作的信心也就更大了些。以后我在党校四部做文化教员，天天和工农干部接近，和他们一起学习，从那以后，我愈来愈清楚的看到自己的思想状况：只要一和工农大众接近，我对写作信心就大，而且使我整个生命都变得新鲜和活泼。如果我有一天稍稍远离他们一点，我就又垂头丧气，觉得烦恼了。但对于写作我还是不够勇敢，不够大胆的，我的笔也很滞钝，总赶不上有些同志能及时的反映一些东西，我是拘谨的，总要再三考虑直到看清楚了，自己完全明白了，才敢提笔，例如虽然我也做过一点土改，可是我连报导的短文章也没有敢于写过。另外也有一种标新立异的想法，这就使自己更加束缚住了，不敢动笔。
    “八、一五”后，这近四年来，我一边行军或一边工作，一边就写，我的写就是我的工作，也就是我的学习；自然我还没有写出使大家满意或使自己满意的东西，但是我一点也不丧气，我有的是和工农兵结合，为工农兵服务，向工农兵学习的决心，因而我对于写作的信心和热望也从来没有过的是那样的坚强和饱满。这一次短期进工厂，更加坚定了我的决心和信心。
    最后，我应该说毛主席所指示的文艺方针为工农兵的方向是多么的伟大和正确！是他，在他的座谈会讲话以后，我才找到了我新的写作的生命！
