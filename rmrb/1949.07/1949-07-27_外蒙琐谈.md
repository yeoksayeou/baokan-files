Random Notes on Outer Mongolia
    Miao Qing
    That day, more than a dozen of us young people unanimously asked Comrade Chen to tell us stories about Outer Mongolia. Comrade Chen happily agreed. So he sat down again. Although we didn't applaud, smiles of welcome and excitement appeared on everyone's face. After a moment of silence, Comrade Chen finally began to speak amidst our rapt anticipation:

    "In the past, some people thought Mongolia was a 'poverty-stricken and barren land,' and that Mongolians were 'extremely savage, ugly women and unruly people.' These are completely reactionary lies of Han chauvinism. In fact, Outer Mongolia has plenty of water, grass, cattle, sheep, minerals, and fertile land. The people there cherish justice, honesty, and kindness. If you go to Outer Mongolia, you will see herds of cattle and sheep scattered across the green grasslands, and green streams flowing down the green hills. Songs can be heard everywhere on the hillsides and by the rivers. It is said: 'Songs resound along the green forest riverbank, and cattle and sheep are seen as the wind blows through the grass.' That is absolutely true. There are also many lakes, with lotus flowers and aquatic plants growing densely in them. When the lotus flowers are in full bloom, looking out, the dark blue lake water, the clear sky, and the bright red and green colors competing for beauty on the lake surface... it is truly a beautiful picture. Add to that the schools of fish swimming to and fro, the reflections of the trees, and the reflection of the setting sun, the beauty of it is beyond my ability to describe. If I were to use a Shaanxi saying: 'It's just too beautiful!' As for someone describing it as 'the fragrance of lotus flowers travels for ten miles on the wind,' that is not an exaggeration, but a true fact."

    "Is life there really hard?" Old Zhang asked, taking advantage of Comrade Chen's slight pause.

    "For some to say that life there is hard, that's utter nonsense. The revolution in Outer Mongolia has been successful for twenty years, and they use machines to farm. In the past, twenty years ago, they didn't have enough food, and they relied partly on China or the Soviet Union. But now their industry has greatly developed, and agricultural production is almost entirely mechanized, so now they are self-sufficient in grain."

    "Isn't Outer Mongolia mainly eating beef and mutton?"

    "That's right, Outer Mongolia eats a lot of beef and mutton, and it is quite common. Some people say that Europeans and Americans eat nutritious food, saying they eat bread with butter, but that's only what a small number of the exploiting classes eat. As for the working masses of Europe and America, they toil all day long and endure hunger, while the masses in Outer Mongolia now live very happily. They commonly eat refined grains, beef and mutton, and su oil. Su oil is extracted from sheep's milk through multiple soakings and refinements. Su oil is much more nutritious than butter!"

    "How many cattle and sheep do they have there?" we asked.

    "I'm not too sure of the exact number, but averaging it out per capita, each person... oh, how many head do you think each person averages?"

    "Five head!" Old Wang boldly guessed high. Comrade Chen shook his head.

    "Each person averages more than thirty head!" Comrade Chen finally said.

    "What do the women of Outer Mongolia look like?" Little Li asked mischievously.

    "About the same as here, there are pretty ones and not-so-pretty ones. But the women there can all ride horses and are very strong. They wear colorful silk scarves on their heads, tied in a knot on top like a heroic knot. They wear long robes, with wide belts around their waists. They walk very gracefully. Some are adorned with decorations. Their bodies are beautiful, strong, and agile. There are so many beautiful women like that in Outer Mongolia."

    "Are Mongolians good to Han people?" Old Wang asked.

    "In the past, the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek clique practiced Han chauvinism, invading and oppressing minority nationalities. Of course, the people of Outer Mongolia were dissatisfied with them. So the reactionaries took the opportunity to spread rumors that Outer Mongolia hated Han people. That's complete nonsense. The people of Outer Mongolia hated the Kuomintang reactionaries. That wasn't for any other reason than because they implemented 'Han chauvinism,' which bullied Outer Mongolia too severely."

    "How are they towards Han people now?"

    "The Communist Party is internationalist and patriotic. Domestically, it has always advocated national self-determination and equality among all nationalities. Of course, they are not only not dissatisfied with us now, but are also very good to us. And we also treat our Mongolian compatriots very favorably. For example, we have reduced land taxes for Mongolian compatriots by ten percent. Furthermore, there are also Mongolian banner governments and offices established by Mongolian compatriots within Suiyuan Province. These are just a couple of examples, and there are certainly many others. Now that the Chinese revolution is about to succeed, the reactionaries' Han chauvinism will also be overthrown. Moreover, our liberated areas and Outer Mongolia have the same goals in our current and future struggles. So now, Outer Mongolia not only has no dissatisfaction with us, but is also very friendly to us..."

    After Comrade Chen finished speaking, more than a dozen of us children who had been poisoned by the reactionaries' Han chauvinism finally took an antidote. We felt like we had seen the sun after the clouds had parted, and our spirits felt refreshed. Reflecting on the mistakes of the past, when we had been deceived and had a bad impression of Outer Mongolia, we all looked at each other in shame. Then everyone exchanged joyful smiles.

　　外蒙琐谈
    苗青
    那天，我们十几个年青人异口同声的，要求陈同志给我们讲述外蒙的故事；陈同志欣悦地答应了，于是他重新坐下来，我们虽然没有鼓掌，然而在每个人的脸上却露出了欢迎和兴奋的微笑，经过了一忽儿的沉默，陈同志在我们聚精会神的期待中终于开讲了：
    “过去有些人认为蒙古是‘穷苦盖世，荒凉不毛’之地；认为蒙古人是‘野横备至，丑妇刁民’，这完全是大汉族主义的反动谎言；其实外蒙古有的是水草、牛羊、矿产、良田，其民族性也酷爱正义忠厚和蔼，如果你们到了外蒙，就会看到成群的牛羊散布在青翠的草原，在青青的山丘上，迂泻下绿绿的流水，山崖河边到处是歌声一片。所谓：‘绿林河畔歌声扬，风吹草低见牛羊。’那真是一点也不假，那里的湖泊也很多，湖中荷花水草密密的丛生，当荷花盛开时，一眼望去，如黛的湖水，晴朗的天空，湖面上鲜红与碧绿争艳……那真是一幅美丽的图画，再加上成群的游鱼，游来游去，树的倒影和夕阳的反照，那个美劲，我真是形容不出来，若用一句陕西话说：‘那真是美的太！’至于有人形容为‘风吹荷花十里香’一语，那并非过分夸耀而是真有其事”。
    “那里生活到底苦不苦呢？”趁陈同志稍微一停，老张就发问了。
    “有些人说那里生活如何苦，那才是瞎说呢。外蒙革命成功已将二十年了，人家种地都是机器。在过去，在二十年前，他们的食粮不够用，有一部分是靠中国或靠苏联的，可是现在人家的工业大为发展了，农业生产也差不多都用机器了，所以现在人家的粮食也足以自给了。”
    “不是外蒙古主要是吃牛羊肉吗？”
    “不错，外蒙古吃牛羊肉是非常多而相当普遍的，有人说欧美人吃的营养好，说什么吃面包沾牛油，其实那只是少数剥削阶级吃的，至于欧美的劳苦大众也是劳苦终日忍饥挨饿，而外蒙古现在群众生活得很幸福，人家普遍吃的是细粮、牛羊肉和苏油，苏油是从羊奶中经过多次的泡制提炼出来的，苏油要比牛油的营养大多了！”
    “他们那里的牛羊究竟有多少呢？”我们问。
    “具体的数目我也闹不太清，可是按人口平均下来，每人……噢，你们猜每人平均多少头？”
    “五头！”老王大胆的往多处猜，陈同志摇摇头。
    “每人平均合三十多头！”陈同志终于说出来了。
    “外蒙的女子长的怎么样？”小李调皮地问。
    “和我们这里差不多，也是有漂亮的有不漂亮的。可是那里的女子都会骑马，身体非常强健，她们的头上都是用彩色的纱绸包着头，上边打了一结好象英雄结，身上穿着长衣，腰间缠着宽大的外带，走起路来非常的健美，有的满戴装饰品，身体美丽强健而灵活，象这样美丽的女子到外蒙那可真是太多了。”
    “蒙古人对汉人好吗？”老王问。
    “过去国民党蒋匪集团实行大汉族主义，侵略压迫少数民族，当然外蒙古的人民对他们不满，于是反动派就乘机造谣，外蒙仇视汉人，那完全是瞎说，外蒙人是仇视国民党反动派的，那不是别的，是因为他们实行的‘大汉族主义’欺侮的外蒙太厉害了。”
    “他们现在对汉人怎样？”
    “共产党是国际主义者，又是爱国主义者，对内一向主张民族自决，各民族一律平等，当然现在他们不但不对我们不满，而且对我们很好，而我们对于蒙胞也很优待，如我们在田赋上对蒙胞有减轻百分之十的优待，再者绥远省内还有蒙胞成立的旗蒙政府和办事处。这不过是一两点例子，其他当然还很多，现在中国革命快成功，反动派的大汉族主义，亦将随之被打倒；何况我们解放区和外蒙古现在以及将来的奋斗目标都一致，所以现在外蒙古不但对我们没有丝毫的不满，而且对我们还是很友好，……”
    陈同志说完之后，我们十几个受过反动派大汉族主义毒的孩子，如今才吃了一服解毒药，我们如拨云见日，精神顿觉清爽。回想过去受骗，对外蒙印象不好的错误，真是相顾羞赧，接着大家互相投了一个欣悦的微笑。
