Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 27th: TASS, Washington: Truman, in a message to Congress on the 25th, requested approval of a plan to arm the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty and other countries. Truman once again repeated his long-exposed fallacy, insisting that the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, supplemented by an arms plan, "supports the principles of the United Nations Charter." He vehemently claimed that the guarantees of the United Nations alone are currently "not enough." According to him, it is necessary to arm Western European countries and other countries "so that they can protect themselves from the threat of aggression," although everyone knows that no country intends to attack them. According to Truman, the arms plan is necessary to "support our international economic plan, especially the European Recovery Program," which is to support the Marshall Plan. It is well known that the Marshall Plan has completely failed, and it has caused the stagnation of European industry and the real threat of an impending economic crisis, so Truman's words are simply indescribable. In fact, rearming Western European countries and the obligations stipulated by the Atlantic Treaty, on the one hand, impose an unbearable burden on the American people, and at the same time constitute a major obstacle to the revival of Western European countries. But Truman didn't mention a word about this. Then he brazenly attacked the Soviet Union, saying that it was not the United States but the Soviet Union that was "obstructing the recovery of Europe." In his message, Truman suggested providing Western European countries with three types of assistance: First, a certain amount of dollar aid to enable them to increase their arms production; second, direct delivery of certain basic military equipment; and third, expert assistance in the production and use of military equipment and personnel training. Truman suggested continuing to supply Greece and Turkey with military equipment, and providing Iran, South Korea, and the Philippines with military assistance. He also suggested extending the arms plan to Canada and other countries in the Americas, but such countries should "pay for" their military equipment. Truman asked Congress to earmark $1.45 billion from this year's new appropriations for the implementation of the "grant plan"; and pointed out that most of it should be used to arm Western European countries. Truman said: This amount is "only a small part" compared to the expenses that these countries themselves will spend on military equipment. Truman also said that these countries should not transfer weapons to other countries without the permission of the United States, and that "the President should be authorized to stop aid at any time." Here he made it clear that if the actions of these countries do not conform to the policies of the United States, the United States will stop its aid to them.

　　杜鲁门再次重复破产谬论
  　狂吠武装西欧等国
    实质是加重美人民负担障碍西欧复兴
    【新华社北平二十七日电】塔斯社华盛顿讯：杜鲁门于二十五日咨文国会，要求批准武装北大西洋公约签字国及其他国家的计划。杜鲁门再一次重复他早已被揭穿过的谬论，硬说由武装计划加以补充的侵略性的北大西洋公约，是“支持联合国宪章的原则”。他力称：现时只有联合国的保证是“不够”的。据他说：需要武装西欧国家以及其他国家，“以便它们能够保护它们自己不受侵略的威胁”，虽然谁都知道，并没有那一个国家打算进攻它们。根据杜鲁门的说法，武装计划是“支持我们的国际经济计划，特别是欧洲复兴计划”所必需的，也就是支持马歇尔计划所必需的。尽人皆知，马歇尔计划已完全失败，它已引起欧洲工业的停滞和经济危机临近的真正威胁，所以杜鲁门的话简直是离奇得不可名状。其实，重新武装西欧国家以及大西洋公约所规定的义务，一方面给美国人民压上不可忍受的重担，而同时又构成西欧国家复兴的一个主要障碍。但是关于这一点，杜鲁门却只字未提。接着他就放肆地攻击苏联，说什么不是美国而是苏联“阻挠着欧洲的复兴”。杜鲁门在咨文中建议供给西欧国家以三种援助：一、一定数目的美元援助，使它们能够增加它们的军火生产；二、直接送给某些基本军事装备；三、以专家帮助军事装备的生产和使用与人员的训练。杜鲁门建议继续供给希腊和土耳其以军事装备，并且供给伊朗、南朝鲜及菲律宾以军事援助。他还建议将武装计划扩及加拿大和美洲其他国家，但这类国家应“由它们自己出钱”来取得军事装备。杜鲁门要求国会从本年度的新拨款中，指定十四亿五千万元充作实行“赠款计划”之用；并且指出其中大部分应用在武装西欧国家上。杜鲁门说：这个数目和这些国家自己要花在军事装备的开支比起来“只是很少的一部分”。杜鲁门还说：这些国家未经美国允许，不得将武器转送他国，而且“应该授权总统可以随时停止援助”。这里他明白表示：如果这些国家的行为不合乎美国的政策，美国就将停止对它们的援助。
