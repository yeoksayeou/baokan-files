Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: Moscow Dispatch: Sonina recently published an article in Labor Daily commenting on the British strike struggle, stating that the struggle between British workers and employers has become increasingly acute with the deterioration of the British economy under the Marshall Plan.

The series of labor disputes and large-scale strikes in Britain now prove the growing determination of British workers to defend their rights. Tens of thousands of railway workers in northeastern and northern England have systematically held five weeks of weekend strikes to protest new timetables that make their work extremely arduous. It is very symbolic that large-scale strikes are expanding in state-owned enterprises. In these enterprises, the situation of workers has deteriorated due to the policies of the Labor government. Fifty-two thousand miners in Lancashire recently held a two-week strike, and the strikers only returned to work after receiving assurances that the workers' demands would be met. The strike of tens of thousands of dockworkers on the west coast of Britain in solidarity with striking Canadian sailors has now lasted for more than a month. Nine thousand five hundred dockworkers in Liverpool went on strike to protest the layoff of forty-five dockworkers for refusing to unload the Canadian ship "Dromore". The strike of 14,000 dockworkers in London has gained momentum and threatens to engulf everything.

Right-wing trade union leaders are attempting to intimidate strikers by spreading forged documents about a "Communist conspiracy" among dockworkers. The initiator of this movement is Deakin, the general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union. The current scale of the dock strike has caused alarm among the British ruling group. They sent troops to the port to unload goods and, at the same time, announced the Emergency Powers Act. The government, employers, and right-wing trade union leaders are trying to use this method to stop the strike and force the dockworkers to submit.

Recent strikes in Britain, especially the dock strike, prove that the sentiment of proletarian solidarity is growing among workers. The strikers have demonstrated a high degree of awareness and determination, and they have strictly observed discipline despite material difficulties. Although most of the strikes are economic in nature, they have profound political significance, proving the bankruptcy of the British government's domestic policies. The intensification of class struggle in Britain proves that more and more workers have begun to recognize the true face of right-wing trade union leaders.

    劳动报评英国罢工运动
    英阶级斗争尖锐化
    证明英政府内政政策已破产
    【新华社北平十六日电】莫斯科讯：索尼娜顷在劳动报上撰文评论英国罢工斗争称：英国工人与雇主间的斗争，已随着马歇尔化的英国经济情况的恶化而趋于尖锐化。
    英国现在碰到一连串的劳工纠纷和大规模罢工，这证明英国工人保卫其权利的决心日益增长。数万名铁路工人在英国东北部及北部有系统地举行了五个星期的星期大罢工，以抗议新的行车时间表，这种新的时间表使他们的工作极其辛苦。非常有象征性的是在国营企业中扩展着的大规模罢工。在这些企业中，由于工党政府的政策，工人们的境况已经恶化。兰开厦五万二千名矿工最近举行两星期的罢工，罢工者直到得到保证满足工人的要求之后才复了工。英国西海岸声援罢工的加拿大水手的数万名码头工人的罢工，现在已持续了一个多月。九千五百名利物浦码头工人罢工，以抗议因拒绝起卸加拿大船德罗摩尔号而停雇四十五名码头工人的事件。有一万四千人参加的伦敦码头工人的罢工，已有席卷一切之势。
    右冀工会领袖企图以在码头工人中间散布关于“共产党阴谋”的伪造文件恫吓罢工者。这一运动的倡导人是运输及各业工人工会的总书记狄金。码头罢工现有的规模，已在英国统治集团中引起惊恐。他们派遣军队到港口搬卸货物，同时，宣布了紧急权力法案。政府、雇主和右翼工会领袖们，企图用这种方法制止罢工，强迫码头工人屈服。
    英国最近的罢工，特别是码头罢工，证明无产阶级团结一致的感情，正在工人中间增长着。罢工者表现了高度的觉悟与坚决，他们不顾物质的困难，严守纪律。尽管大多数的罢工都是属于经济性质，然而，罢工却有着深刻的政治意义，证明了英国政府内政政策的破产。英国阶级斗争的尖锐化证明，越来越多的工人，已开始认清右翼工会领袖的真面目。
