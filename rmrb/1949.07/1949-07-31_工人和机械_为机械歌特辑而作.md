　　Workers and Machines
    Written for the Mechanical Song Special
    Cao Ming
    I remember a writer describing a peasant (from the old liberated areas) whose family wept bitterly when his draught cattle died. This writer had a very profound understanding of the feelings between the peasant and one of his important tools of production – the draught cattle.
    This time, working in the Huanggu Railway Factory in Shenyang, I gained a further understanding of the interrelationship between workers and machines, the workers' feelings for machines, and how this relationship and feeling changed with liberation.
    Workers and machines are closely related and inseparable; they cannot do without them in order to carry out production. In daily production, for its sake, he gets his hands full of oil, and lets the oil stains dye his clothes black and shiny. Workers take great care to protect the machine, as if protecting their own hands and feet. If an outsider comes forward and messes up the parts and tools, the worker will get angry. They understand the nature of the machines they use, their characteristics and faults. They don't easily lend their own lathes to others (mainly for fear of breaking them); like the car driven by driver Lao Yang, he drives it very smoothly, and the people sitting inside feel very comfortable. When others drive it, it will bump and make a de--lu, de--lu, shaking sound from time to time.
    When the lumberyard couldn't deliver white pine last year, the sawyer (electric saw) Zheng Lianqi often sawed red pine, so the large saw often broke. Naturally, the large saw could still be welded after it broke, but welding is never as good as being complete, and it is also labor-intensive and costly to repair. This was a very unpleasant thing. Zheng Lianqi looked at it with great heartache. But he didn't blame the wood for being bad, he only said that he was not capable and ruined things. So he wrote a song on a piece of plywood and hung it on the saw repair rack to vent his self-reproach.
    Look at Wang Gui, a skilled worker who has been in the factory for twenty-five years. After liberation, he was promoted to deputy director of the branch factory. At that time, he had to leave the machine that had accompanied him for many years. He reluctantly gave the machine to a partner he was on good terms with and whose skills were not bad. He often made excuses to come back and say a word or two, looking at his old friend (his lathe).
    With the improvement of awareness, workers not only cherish machines, but also, along with dedicating materials and saving raw materials, further transform machines and improve productivity to support the front lines. Old worker Han Zhongzhu, he was at the Tangshan Bridge Factory before the Great Revolution. At that time, he and many workers were involved in the vigorous labor movement under the leadership of Comrade Deng Fa; after the liberation of Shenyang this time, he was the first to transform his lathe, and production efficiency increased. In the past, he only turned sixty threaded pairs a day, but now he turns more than two hundred. Yu Jing, a fitter who had been framed by the Kuomintang, joined the Three People's Principles Youth League, and served as a district team leader, also regretted his past mistakes under the influence and promotion of everyone, made amends for his mistakes, and tried his best to improve the turning tool of the large wheel rim, so that the quality and quantity of the large wheel rim were improved afterward.
    But we have not forgotten the subtle, tortuous, complex and intricate psychology of the workers towards machinery before liberation, which was both joyful and pitiful, and both loving and hateful.
    The workers wrote in their articles recalling the past: "We stood in front of the machine with our empty stomachs, it was drooping, and I was drooping too." "I was wearing tattered clothes, and the machine was dirty, but I was too lazy to wipe it; as long as it could move." "My hands are slow enough, damn it, it turns even slower than me. I am slow because I am unhappy, doesn't it feel unhappy too?"
    From their articles, we can see that the workers gave the machine such deep feelings; giving it a personality. We can also see that the machine suffered the same fate as them. Isn't that right? In the spring of 1947, the workers there launched a three-day strike. At that time, weren't they standing next to the angry, motionless machines with resolute and solemn faces, straightening their hungry and weak bodies, to resist the rule of bureaucratic capital?
    They knew that it was the four major families of Chiang, Soong, Kong and Chen and their pawns - the people who enjoyed good food and drink - who enslaved them, not the machines, but when they got angry, they often ruined machines and tools. I think this stems from two reasons. One is that they consciously wanted to ruin the wealth of the rulers (if the tools and machines are broken, they have to buy new ones); the other is an unconscious act of venting anger, just like workers who get drunk or beat their wives and children when they are poor and helpless.
    Not long after liberation, Jin Yuchun, the "poet" (I gave him that title) of the Huanggu Railway Factory, became known for writing a "Beiping" poem (praising the "Beiping" locomotive that they repaired with their own hands to welcome the liberation of Beiping). Soon after, he sent me a "Mechanical Song", which fully expressed the feelings of workers and machines; later I discovered Zheng Lianqi's self-reproach poem hanging on the saw repair rack; I was very interested. I remember that soldiers in the army once created a rifle poem movement; so why can't workers have a "Mechanical Song" movement? So, I put forward my idea at various meetings such as the communication team leader meeting, the wall newspaper负责人 meeting of each branch factory, and the discussion meeting of the literary and art group. Soon, many poems about machines, tools, raw materials, etc. were collected in various factories. Some of them are written very well, and only workers can write about the familiarity of the production process, the vivid description, the vividness, and the authenticity of the feelings. We outsiders can't compare.
    In the works of the workers, not only the endless talents of the workers are displayed; but also under the enlightenment of democracy and politics in this new society, the workers' understanding and need for literature and art have also been unprecedentedly improved. Workers in many factories spontaneously organized choruses, drama troupes, Yangko teams, started wall newspapers, and wrote scripts. There are also many illustrations on the wall newspapers.
    In the Huanggu Railway Factory alone, the wall newspaper was started ten days after liberation, and half a month before the New Year, a music team (jointly organized by staff and workers, with wind instruments, string instruments, and a hodgepodge of Chinese and foreign instruments), Yangko team, drama troupe, etc. were established. At that time, they asked me for scripts. I thought that there were very few scripts about workers, so I replied casually: "You can write your own, write your own stories".
    "Okay, let's write it ourselves. Anyway, black hands can't act white hands." In a few days, news reports, one-act plays, and three-act plays came out. Naturally, they were all about their own past (reminiscences and accusations of the Kuomintang's crimes), and at the same time reflected the current life (such as improved living conditions, improved status, democratic evaluation of wages, labor insurance, the establishment of a new labor attitude, dedication and thrift, etc.).
    Mechanical Song is a format created by the workers themselves, and it is loved by the masses after a little promotion. Now, many workers in the factory have written poems for their own machines and posted them on the machines to express their feelings and relationship with the machines they operate.
    I think that such mechanical songs can be promoted in various factories. Because it can inspire workers to cherish machines and tools more, understand more about the great significance of their products, and promote the thinking of transforming tools and machines. And more importantly, it is to promote a closer integration of literature and art with production.
    Since the workers have become the masters of the house, their minds have become more flexible. They fight difficulties on the production front and give full play to their creativity; even on the literary and art front, they timely reflect everything around them and constantly create their own formats and languages. This is also another manifestation of the proletarian's rapid, creative, wise, and accurate characteristics.

　　工人和机械
    为机械歌特辑而作
    草明
    我曾记得一位作家描写一个农民（老解放区的）死了他的耕牛时，全家号啕大哭。这位作家对农民与他的生产重要工具之一——耕牛的感情，体会的非常深刻。
    这一次我在沈阳皇姑屯铁路工厂工作，对于工人与机械的互相关系，工人对机械的感情，和这种关系与感情随着解放而起的变化等，有了进一步的体会。
    工人和机械是息息相关，不可分离的，为了进行生产，他离不了它。在每天的生产中，为了它，他弄的满手油污，并让油污把衣服染得黑油油地发亮。工人加意保护机器，好象保护自己的手脚一样，如果外行人走前去把机件和工具弄乱的话，工人会发脾气的。他们懂得自己所使用的机械的性质，它的特点和毛病。他们自己的床子轻易不借给别人使唤（主要怕弄坏了）；象司机老杨开的一部车子，他开起来非常平稳，坐在里面的人觉得很舒服。别人一开，就会颠簸，且不时的发出来得——噜，得——噜，一阵抖动的声音。
    火锯（电锯）工人郑连岐在去年白松木领不来的时候，常锯红松木，因此大锯常常锯断。自然，大锯断了还能焊接，但焊接的总不如完整的好，而且接起来又费工费料。这是一件极不愉快的事。郑连岐瞅着心痛的很。可是他不怨木料不好，只说自己没本事，糟塌东西，他就用一块三合板写上了一首歌，挂在修锯架上，来发泄发泄自咎的心情。
    再看看在该厂呆了二十五年的熟练工人王贵罢，解放后他被升为分厂的副厂长，那时他得离开那伴随了他多年的机器。他十分难受地把机器让给一位与他相好，而技术又不坏的伙伴。他常借故回来说一两句话，瞅瞅他的老朋友（他的镟床）。
    随着觉悟的提高，工人不仅爱护机器，还和献纳器材与节省原料同时，进一步来改造机械，提高生产力，以支援前线。老工友韩忠柱，他当大革命前曾在唐山桥工厂，那时他和许多工人在邓发同志领导下卷入过热火朝天的工人运动里的；这次沈阳解放后，他首先起来改造他的镟床，生产效率提高了。过去每天只镟六十个丝对，现在镟二百个以上。那个曾被国民党陷害过，参加了三青团，担当过区分队长的钳工余靖，也在大伙影响推动之下痛改前非，将功赎罪，极力改良大轮圈的镟刀，使得以后大轮圈的质量和数量都提高。
    不过我们还没有忘记解放以前，工人们对机械那种既喜又怜，又爱又恨的委婉曲折的复杂综错的心理。
    工人们在回忆过去的文章里这样写道：“我们捺着饿瘪了的肚皮站在机器前面，它垂头丧气，我也垂头丧气。”“我穿的破烂不堪，机器也埋汰不堪，可是我懒得擦；只要它还能动弹就行。”“我的双手已经够慢了，他妈的它比我转的更慢。我慢是因为心里不痛快，难道它也不痛快么？”
    从他们的文章里，可以看见工人们给机器以那么深厚的感情；赋予它以性格。还可以看见，机器是和他们遭遇了同一的命运的。可不是吗？一九四七年春天，那儿的工人曾掀起过三天的怠工运动。那时节，他们不是满脸坚决与庄严，挺直了饿软的身子，站在愤怒的、不动的机械旁边去抵制官僚资本的统治吗？
    他们知道奴役他们的是蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族和他们的爪牙——吃香的喝辣的的脚色，而不是机器，不过他们愤怒起来时，常常会糟塌机器和工具。我想，这出自两个原因，一个是他们有意识地要糟塌统治者的财富（工具和机器坏了，他要买新的）；另一个就是无意识的泄忿行为，正象工人穷困无告时即酗酒，或殴打自己的妻、儿一样。
    解放后不久，皇姑屯铁路工厂的“诗人”（我给他起的）金毓春以写了一首“北平号”（是歌颂他们亲手修的以迎接北平解放“北平号”机车的诗）见称。又不久，他送了一首“机械歌”给我看，它充分地表现了工人与机械的感情；后来我又发现了郑连岐的挂在修锯架子上面的自咎诗；我非常感到兴趣。我记得，部队里士兵们曾经创造过枪杆诗运动；那么，工人为什么不能来个“机械歌”运动？于是，我在通讯小组长会议，各分厂的壁报负责人会议，和文艺小组的讨论会等各种会议上，把我这个意思提出。不久，在各个现厂里即收来了许多关于机械、工具、原料等的诗歌。有些写的很不错，而对生产过程的熟悉，描写的生动，有声有色，以及感情的逼真等，就只有工人才写得出来，咱们这些门外汉真望尘莫及的。
    在工人的作品里，不仅显示了工人们无尽的才能；而且在这新社会的民主政治的启导下，工人们对文艺的认识和需要，也空前地提高了。许多工厂里的工人自发地组织歌咏队、剧团、秧歌队，动手办壁报、编剧本，壁报上还有许多插画。
    仅皇姑屯铁路工厂，解放后十天，壁报就办起来了，新年以前半个月，已成立了音乐队（职员与工人合办，有管乐、弦乐、和中外的乐器乱七八糟凑成的），秧歌队、剧团等。当时他们向我要剧本，我寻思关于工人的剧本很少，就随口答道：“你们自己编吧，编你们自己的事”。
    “好，咱自己来编，反正黑爪子演不了白爪子的演”。不几天，活报，独幕剧，三幕剧都出来了。自然，写的尽是他们自己过去的（回忆和控诉国民党的罪恶的事实），同时也反映了现在的生活（如生活改善、地位提高、民主评定工资、劳动保险、新劳动态度的建立、献纳和节约等）。
    机械歌，是工友自己创造出来的格式，稍加提倡，即被群众所喜爱。现在，该厂许多工人已自己给自己的机械编上了诗歌，贴在机械上，以表示出自己对所操纵的机器的感情和关系。
    我觉得，象这样的机械歌，在各个工厂里都可以提倡。因为它可以启发工人更爱护机器和工具，更了解自己的生产品所具有的重大意义，和促起改造工具和机器的思想。而更重要的，是促使文艺与生产更密切地结合起来。
    工人自从当了家，心眼就灵活起来，他们在生产战线上和困难战斗，发挥了创造力；即在文艺战线上，也及时地反映了围绕着他们的一切，并不断地创造自己的格式和语言。这也是无产阶级的迅速、创造、智慧、准确的特点的又一表现。
