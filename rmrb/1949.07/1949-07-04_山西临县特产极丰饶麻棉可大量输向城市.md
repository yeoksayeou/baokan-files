　　Shanxi Lin County's Abundant Local Products, Hemp and Cotton, Can Be Shipped to Cities in Large Quantities
    [Taiyuan Electric] Shanxi Lin County's local and special products have begun to be exported to cities. According to statistics from the county's Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the county has already transported more than 4,000 catties of hemp, more than 2,600 catties of medicinal materials such as licorice root, coltsfoot flower, and rhubarb to Tianjin, Taiyuan and other cities. In addition, more than 30,000 catties of black cashmere will also be shipped to supply the wool textile industry in Taiyuan City as raw materials. Lin County is one of the counties in Shanxi with abundant special products, especially hemp, which is of excellent quality, pure white in color, and has particularly fine fibers, suitable for making rayon. Before the war, it was sold in large quantities to Tianjin and Taiyuan. In recent years, due to the interruption of sales channels, the hemp fields have decreased from 20,000 mu to 3,000 mu. This year, with the complete liberation of North China, the People's Government called on the county to plant 6,662 mu of hemp. The peasants responded positively, purchased hemp seeds one after another, and applied fertilizer with a large amount of black beans. Now it has exceeded the plan. For example, in the First District, the original plan was 1,662 mu, but now 1,803 mu have been sown. If each mu produces 80 catties of hemp, it is estimated that the county will produce 520,000 catties of hemp this year, of which 470,000 catties can be supplied to large cities as raw materials. Cotton can be planted on more than 60,000 mu, producing more than 900,000 catties of cotton, of which 300,000 to 400,000 catties can also be supplied to cities. In order to further promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the county's Bureau of Industry and Commerce is continuing to organize public and private shops to promote local products and specialties in a planned manner in exchange for the necessities of the peasants. In June, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce assigned the task of purchasing local medicinal materials to various rural cooperatives, including 2,000 to 4,000 catties of powdered licorice root (peeled licorice root), 200 catties of Yuanzhi, and several thousand catties of pig bile. In addition, such as eggs, bristles, and fur are all industrial necessities, and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce also plans to purchase them in large quantities and sell them to cities.

　　山西临县特产极丰饶麻棉可大量输向城市
    【太原电】山西临县土货、特产已开始向城市输出。据该县工商局统计，全县运销平津及太原等城市的物品，已有麻四千余斤，甘草、冬花、大黄等药材二千六百余斤，并有三万余斤黑羊绒亦将启运供给太原市毛织业作原料。临县为山西特产丰富的县份之一，特别是麻，品质优良，颜色洁白，纤维特细，适于制人造丝。战前曾大宗销售于天津及太原等地。近年以销路断绝，麻田由两万亩降至三千亩。今年华北全部解放，人民政府号召全县种麻六千六百六十二亩，农民积极响应，纷纷购买麻籽，大量以黑豆施肥，现已超过计划。如一区原计划一千六百六十二亩，现已下种一千八百零三亩。如每亩按产麻八十斤计，估计全县今年将产麻五十二万斤，其中四十七万斤可供应大城市为生产原料。种棉可逾六万亩，可产棉花九十余万斤，其中三十至四十万斤亦可供应城市。为更进一步促进城乡物资交流，该县工商局正继续组织公私商店，有计划地推销本地土货、特产，以换回农民必需品。六月间工商局给各农村合作社布置了收购本地药材的任务，计收粉甘草（剥皮甘草）两千至四千斤，远志二百斤，猪答数千斤等。此外，如鸡蛋、猪鬃、皮毛等均为工业必需品，工商局亦拟大量采购，向城市推销。
