　　Technician Wang Qingtang and Others Successfully Produce
  　High-Voltage Suspension Insulator with a Tensile Strength of 4.5 Tons
    [Tangshan Dispatch] Wang Qingtang and other technicians at the Qixin Porcelain Factory have successfully developed a high-voltage suspension insulator (for high-voltage power lines) with a tensile strength of 4.5 tons over four months. In the past, national technicians at the factory had continuously researched this type of high-voltage suspension insulator for a year, but the tensile strength never exceeded 2.5 tons. After the liberation of Tangshan last year, large power plants in Shijiazhuang, Chengde, and the Northeast successively sent letters requesting to purchase this type of electromagnetic device, but it was not produced because it had not yet been successfully developed. After the liberation of Tangshan, Technician Wang and others continued their research based on the tensile strength of 2.5 tons, increasing the magnet inside the "iron fitting" and reducing the spiral gap from large to small. After many experiments in early May, they finally succeeded. The standard tensile strength for high-voltage suspension insulators is generally four tons, and in the past, imported products were used.

　　技师王庆棠等制成
  　拉力四吨半的高压悬垂吊瓶
    【唐山电】启新磁厂技师王庆棠等，四个月中，研究制造成功了拉力达四吨半的高压悬垂吊瓶（高压电线用）。这种高压悬垂吊瓶，过去曾经该厂国技师连续研究一年，结果拉力始终未超过两吨半。去年唐山解放后，石家庄、承德、东北等地大发电厂均先后函购此种电磁器，惟因尚未成功，故未承做。唐山解放后，经王技师等在拉力两吨半基础上继续研究，把“铁合”内的磁加大，同时把螺旋空由大改小，在五月初，经多次实验终于成功。按高压悬垂吊瓶的拉力标准一般为四吨，过去均用舶来品。
