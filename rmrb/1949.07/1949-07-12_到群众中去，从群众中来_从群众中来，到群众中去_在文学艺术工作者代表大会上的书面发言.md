　　Going to the Masses, From the Masses
  　From the Masses, to the Masses
    —Written Speech at the Literary and Art Workers Representative Conference
    Ding Ling
    Chairman Mao’s speech at the forum on literature and art defined the direction of literature and art in New China. However, to realize this direction, all literary and art workers in the liberated areas must be determined to implement it, work hard, and persevere. In real life, in the life of the broad masses, and in the struggle with the masses, we must transform ourselves, wash away all past personal emotions, and cultivate the masses’ living knowledge, struggle knowledge, and the collective spirit of the masses’ feelings, and try to express what has been experienced. This road is indeed not difficult to walk, because the masses are so good and welcome us so much; but it is also not so simple and without problems. Although the literature and art of the liberated areas have already achieved many successes, as Comrade Zhou Yang said, it is indeed only a beginning. Literary and art workers still need to discard the petty-bourgeois and all individualistic dirty things that have been discarded or are about to be discarded, and must be discarded, more cleanly and thoroughly. They must consolidate and expand the preliminary results of transformation, with the masses as the main body, using the interests of the masses to measure right and wrong, calmly, handling problems from the perspective of policy implementation, and all qualities of serving the masses, and strive to make themselves worthy of Chairman Mao's followers, truly and authentically a people's literary and art worker.
    So what are some of the problems that exist in our initial integration with the masses? As far as I can think of temporarily, there are these issues:
    I. Being a guest or being a master together with the masses. This means what attitude we take when we go down. Being a guest means observing with a polite attitude, listening and watching. Naturally, at the beginning, the masses will welcome you. Although they feel that you are not helping them and have no practical significance to them, they will also help you a little. However, what you get will definitely be superficial, and because of your subjective views, you will misjudge things. Being a master together with the masses means that you feel that the affairs of the masses are your affairs. You not only have to investigate, but also study carefully, and think of solutions for the masses. If you give the masses something first, then the masses will naturally come to you and ask you for advice, telling you the situation in detail without being tiresome. Then, what you want to get will be here.
    II. Being a teacher or being a student. Being a master together with the masses is only your attitude and your thinking, but it does not mean that you should gesticulate and command the masses. Anyone who likes to be self-righteous, offer random ideas, gesticulate, and point fingers is because they are not modest and do not understand the actual situation; such people will not be liked by the masses. We must first adopt the attitude of being a student, learn from the masses, and truly learn well, understand them, and help them come up with ideas, so that your ideas are acceptable to them. This kind of being a teacher while also being a student is most liked by the masses.
    III. Writing or doing a good job. When we go down, it is for writing, but we must first have the spirit of doing a good job, not simply for writing, but with work as the priority, and the result is still for writing. Simply for writing, it is inevitable to temporarily collect some materials, but this is a last resort, a method for people with special life experience and creative cultivation. Because simply for writing, you can often only collect some interesting stories, or see some superficial activities of characters, and you can also write some better reports or general literary works, but it is not easy to grasp policies and understand characters. Participating in work will definitely make you study issues in detail, study the thinking of various characters, and the correctness and deviations in policy implementation. Moreover, you will definitely have to solve in your works the problems that you have solved and have not solved in your work. This is called the ideological and political nature of the work. Only the characters understood in the struggle will be more fleshed out and emotional.
    If these problems are solved appropriately and well, a person's living habits, likes and dislikes, and affections will naturally change. The relationship with the masses will also naturally change from being distant to being one, from superficial politeness to being close friends. You will feel that the masses you loved before were very abstract, and that what you said about loving them before was a lie, or at least not true enough, because you did not know them, did not understand them, so how could you say you truly loved them? At this time, you will feel that you truly love them, and their every breath will move you. You will constantly think of them, and you will feel that you must give them more things. You will feel that they are your spiritual supporters and encouragers; and these people are not just one person, but this aunt, or that uncle, but a group of people, a whole.
    If your lifestyle and ideological style have changed, it means you can write. If you write, there will be fewer mistakes, at least the emotions will be right, and you will not write works that are contrary to the needs of the masses; but it does not mean that you can write very good works. Especially because the authors in the liberated areas are very young, and the old authors are also young, because truly writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers is only just beginning. Life experience is certainly lacking, and literary cultivation is also very poor. The frequency and intensity of war, inconvenient transportation, lack of publications, and the needs of work make it impossible for us to settle down and study for a while, research for a while, and writing something is also very busy. Therefore, writing cannot have very precise plans and the necessary more leisurely time; but we must improve the quality of our works step by step from learning, practice, and training while completing tasks. Due to various conditions, many problems still exist in creation. Some have been solved, some remain to be solved, and this is still a problem that urgently needs discussion and is not easy to solve at once.
    I. Selecting themes. Is based on solving the current work tasks and the actual problems of the mass movement. Because the broad masses have been politically liberated, they not only need to have cultural and artistic life, but also urgently require education and guidance, and want to be told what to do. Therefore, we must give them things in a timely manner to meet their needs. The masses cannot wait for us to slowly digest things in life and make some permanent plans. We must do what the masses need now and strive to write well. Is it okay to write like this? I say yes. If the problem is written deeply and solved correctly, it has great educational significance; if the problem is a general problem, and it is also a serious problem, then it has universal educational significance. If a work can play a very large and very universal educational role, why is it not a good work?
    II. Real people and real events versus typical characters. We not only do not oppose writing about real people and real events, but also promote it. Why do we say this? Is it not necessary to write about typical characters? No. What we mean by writing about real people and real events is not writing about anyone or anything, but writing about typical examples of typical characters. These people are mostly heroes among the masses, and they themselves and their heroic deeds have great typicality. Writing about these people has great educational significance for reality and for the masses. And to understand these people and write about these people is also a very good learning experience for the author. But we are not satisfied with real people and real events. We demand more typical and complete characters and deeds, and we are also working towards this direction. Many works have achieved this requirement.
    III. Collectivist spirit. Whether old or new writers in the liberated areas, writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers are all new writers, lacking complete conditions. Therefore, we do not oppose individual creation, but we must promote the collectivist spirit, that is, before writing, there must be an outline, to explain what you want to write, what problems you want to solve, and to hold a forum to study whether your intentions are correct and whether your views are correct. After writing, widely collect opinions, repeat discussions, and revise repeatedly. Some plays are rewritten after being staged, and after several iterations, if they do not meet the wishes of the masses, if they are not very good, they will still not be released. All better works generally go through this path, because the work does not belong to the individual, but to the people, and this cautious attitude should be adopted. Writers should also have this attitude of listening to criticism and revising their works.
    IV. Language issues. The language of the common people is lively and vivid. They do not quibble over words, they do not put on airs. Their rich language is produced by their rich lives. Everything they say is interesting. Once repeated in the mouths of our intellectuals, it becomes dry and tasteless, and sometimes even the meaning cannot be expressed. Our writing is also very stereotyped. Some are particularly Europeanized, and when you say a sentence, you never say it directly, you always have to go around in circles, as if deliberately not wanting people to understand, or there are a lot of adjectives, the more the better, the more profound the more profound it seems, as if it has a literary atmosphere, but it doesn't let people understand, it doesn't let people read on. Therefore, we must not only understand the lives of the masses, understand their feelings, but also learn how they use language, what kind of words they use to express their emotions, this person is different, that person is different. We must learn well, learn naturally, not mechanically use it, not remove some pretentious Europeanized words, and replace them with some hardware store-like allegorical sayings, colloquialisms, and some unnecessary obscure dialects. We want to use the language of the masses to enrich our own articles, and then to enrich the language of the masses.
    V. Form issues. We advocate learning from national and folk forms, because this is a form that the masses are familiar with and accustomed to, and that the masses like to see and hear. And only by using this form, developing and improving it from this form, can it be easier to penetrate the masses and easier to overthrow feudal literature and art. But we also absorb all excellent and useful traditions from abroad. All scientific creative methods in creation must be learned, especially the experience and characteristics of Soviet literature, which are worth learning well.
    VI. Reviewed by experts and reviewed by the masses. Expert review is necessary, because they are indeed experts in seeing problems. They can easily see where the problems are and give authors a lot of professional help; but the work must also be taken to the masses to listen to their opinions, because since it is written for them to see and serve them, then whether they need it or not and whether they are satisfied are naturally very important, and their opinions should naturally be placed as the first item in our consideration.
    The road we have traveled is still the first step of the Long March. Especially since a large number of us came from the old petty bourgeoisie, although the conditions will be better in the future, with the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the help of the People's Army and the People's Government, and the cooperation of various aspects of the new democratic politics, economy, and culture; but there are still many influences of the old society that will come to invade us from time to time. Our own remaining or just dead old consciousness and old emotions will have the possibility of developing and making a comeback. We must be vigilant at all times, work diligently, adhere to the direction of serving the people, the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers, adhere to a simple, head-down, humble, and cautious style, serve the development of production and construction of industry, work hard, and implement it to the end, so that our flowers of literature and art bloom all over China, then we must work hard towards the following directions.
    I. Go deep into life, live for a longer period of time, focus on one point. In the past, due to different environments, we moved too much. In the future, it will be possible. We must not only be familiar with their lives, but also be familiar with their souls. We must fully love them and care for them, and they must always be active in our minds, with inseparable connections, so that we can use them freely. When we want to talk about them, we can be as clear as we are about our family members, and we can be as natural and relaxed as taking out our daily necessities from our pockets.
    II. Study Marxism-Leninism and the Party's policies. Some of our works often fail to meet the demands of the masses. Some feel useless as soon as they are written. Some works were useful at the time, but after a while, a very short while, a few months, a year, two years, the life of this work that once educated the masses is over. The problem is outdated. Where is the reason? That's because our literary and art workers lack Marxism-Leninism, do not understand the policies enough, and only understand some superficial problems. The problems they understand are often only in line with the views of ordinary people at the time, and are not prescient at all. Therefore, they only dare to record some phenomena truthfully, and do not dare to go deep into the problems, and do not dare to criticize the people and events at the time. Therefore, the stories are very good, there is life, and the language is not bad, but the ideological nature is not enough, the political nature is not sharp, and the combativeness is not strong. Such works, even if they seem to be useful at the time, will not be very great, and it is even more impossible to have a longer and greater value. Writers should have a higher political level than ordinary workers, and have a further and more profound understanding of the work at the time and place. They should not only reflect the fighting situation of life at the time, but also point out the essence of that life, analyze and criticize it, and add infinite enthusiasm to the correct and bright side, so as to educate and influence people, and raise people's ideals and emotions a step further. In order to achieve this goal in the work, then only studying Marxism-Leninism can tell us how to analyze the mutual relations of various classes in society and the situation, contradictions, and development in the changes. It helps us analyze society, helps us grasp the direction of social development, foresee the problems that occur in social development, and how to solve them. If we do not have this standard ruler, we cannot measure objective real life.
    III. Study Western literature in a planned, organized, led, and critical manner, especially Soviet literature, as well as the excellent traditions of Chinese literature, and even more to study and research folk forms. In the past, we read very little, and always explored our own paths, the division of labor was unscientific, and we did not exchange opinions, and there was no opportunity for everyone to contribute their experiences to others; we should now conduct research and learning in an organized and planned manner, and tell literary and art workers and readers what is good, what is bad, how to learn, what to learn, and sort out the experiences and contribute them to everyone.
    IV. Launch creation in an organized and led manner. In the past, the leadership of creation was not enough. We have many talented writers, but most of them are very young. In all aspects, their cultivation is not enough. They bury themselves in the bottom, and they have put a lot of effort into their lives and writing. They have some better works, but they still want to improve, and they need someone to help them. Help them how to organize materials, how to organize better, and ask to help them strengthen the policy nature of the work, infuse the work with correct and strong ideas, and how to summarize his life experience and creative experience, so that everyone will have the confidence to adhere to this arduous work, and it will indeed gradually make the work not only in quantity but also in quality to meet the masses' requirements for literature and art. I think there must also be such an organization and special person in charge.
    V. Cultivate young writers and worker-peasant-soldier writers. Today is an era of great creation. Modern China is full of great lives that are worth singing and weeping and are soul-stirring everywhere. And the people are infinitely wise. They themselves are the heroes of the people. Their emotions are full, and their senses are sharp. They are enthusiastic and bold about creation. They can often create fresh, spicy, and vigorous works that grasp the beating pulse of the people and shout out the voices of the people. We can often see such works. Indeed, this is created by a group of talented people's writers. But if such talents are not paid attention to and cultivated, they will be buried like a flower due to the natural climate or other reasons. He wrote things originally by chance, or did not write, or wrote things that were not as good as before, and slowly his emotions fell again. He is very much in need of someone to pay attention to him, encourage him, and help him. For these people, we should not just talk about it, but have someone who is willing to bury their heads and do this work in a down-to-earth manner.
    VI. Transform old artists. These people are quite familiar with the life of the old society, have a good grasp of folk forms, and have skills and creative talents. What they lack is new perspectives and they are not familiar with new lives and new characters. But they have audiences and readers. Times have changed. Although the people do not need the old content, they like this form and are accustomed to this form. Therefore, we must transform these people from a positive aspect and from an ideological perspective. Help them create, so that they can serve the people well.
    VII. Establish criticism. We have done very little criticism work. Many literary and art workers need guidance, and many readers also need criticism to help them learn. They need to point out the direction for literary and art work and works, distinguish right from wrong, and assess the merits. They raise their hands to welcome, but we don't have it. We have not established a led free debate and correct criticism. It can also be said that there is not enough concern for creation, which makes authors and readers feel depressed in a situation of being neglected and ignored for a long time. If there is a lack of correct criticism as guidance, creation will take many detours. In the future, we must develop and establish criticism, hold forums, and collect opinions. There should be consultation and debate, and more correct conclusions. We must recognize that this is seeking the truth, leading literary and art work, and an attitude of being responsible to the masses, rather than involving personal honor and disgrace and sectarian emotions. A writer who truly serves the people should cultivate a truly, all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, calm, objective, and selfless grand spirit.

　　到群众中去，从群众中来
  　从群众中来，到群众中去
    ——在文学艺术工作者代表大会上的书面发言
    丁玲
    毛主席文艺座谈会讲话，规定了新中国的文艺方向，但要实现这个方向，必须由解放区所有文艺工作者下决心去执行，刻苦努力，坚持不懈。在现实生活中，在与广大群众生活中，在与群众一起战斗中，改造自己，洗刷一切过去属于个人的情绪，而富有群众的生活知识斗争知识，和集体精神的群众的感情，并且试图来表现那些已经体验到的东西。这条路的确不是很难走的，因为群众实在太好，太欢迎我们；但也不是那末简单，毫无问题的。今天解放区的文艺，虽然已经有了很多成绩，如周扬同志所说的，但的确也还只是开始。文艺工作者也还须要将已经丢弃过的或准备丢弃、必须丢弃的小资产阶级的、一切属于个人主义的肮脏东西，丢得更干净更彻底，而将已经获得初步的改造的成果，以群众为主体，以群众利益去衡量是非，冷静的、从执行政策中去处理问题的观点，以及一切为群众服务的品质，巩固起来，扩大开去，务必使自己称得起毛主席的信徒，千真不假地一个人民的文艺工作者。
    那末有些什么问题存在于我们开始去和群众结合的问题上呢？就我临时想到，有这样几个问题：
    一、做客人还是和群众一同做主人。这是说我们抱着一种什么态度下去。作客人就是抱着一种客客气气的态度观察一番，听听看看，自然开始的时候，群众也会欢迎的，虽然他觉得你在那里对他没有什么帮助，没有什么实际意义，但他也会帮助你一些，不过你得到的东西，一定会是表面的，而且会因为你主观的看法，你会把事情看差了。和群众一起做主人，就是你觉得群众的事情就是你的事情，你不特要调查，而且要仔细研究，替群众想出解决的方法，你先给群众以东西，那末群众就自然来找你，请教你。把情形不厌其详的告诉你。那末你要得到的东西就都在这里了。
    二、当先生还是当学生。和群众一起做主人，只是你的态度，你的思想，但并非自己去指手划脚，指挥群众。凡是喜欢自以为是，乱出主意，指手划脚，指指点点的人，都是由于他不虚心，他不懂得实际情况而来的；这样的人是不会为群众所喜欢的，我们首先要抱着当学生的态度，先向群众学习，真的学习好了，了解他们，帮他们出主意，使你的主意为他们所愿意接受，这种从当学生中而又当了先生，是为群众所最喜欢的。
    三、为写作还是为把工作做好。我们下去，是为写作，但必须先有把工作做好的精神，不是单纯为写作，是要以工作为重，而结果还是为了写作。单纯为了写作，临时去搜集一些材料也不可免，但这是一个不得已的办法，是一个特别有了生活经验，和创作修养的人的办法，因为单纯为写作，常常只能搜集到一些有趣的故事，或见到一些人物的表面活动，也能够写出一些较好的报导或一般的文学作品，但不容易掌握政策，理解人物。参加工作，就必定使你详细的去研究问题，研究各种人物的思想，和政策执行上的正确与偏差，而且你就一定会要在作品中去解决你在工作中解决过的和没有解决过的问题。这就叫着作品中的思想性和政治性。也只有在斗争中去了解的人物才会更有血肉，有感情。
    这些问题如果解决得适当，解决得好，一个人的生活习惯，喜恶爱憎，自自然然就起了变化。和群众的关系也就很自然的从有距离到一体，从表面的客气到知心朋友，你就会感到你从前所爱的群众，是很抽象的，你从前所说爱他们是假话，至少是不够真实的话，因为你都不认识他们，不了解他们，如何能说真真的爱呢？这时你才感到你真真的爱上了他们，他们的一呼一息都会震动你，你会不断的想他们，你会感到你必须多给他们一些东西，你会感到他们是你精神上的支持者，鼓励者；而这些人又不只是一个人，是这个大娘，或者是那一个大伯，而是一群人，是一个整体。
    自己的生活作风，思想作风有了改变，是说可以写作了，如果去写，错误会少了，至少是情绪对头了，不会写出与群众须要相反的作品；但不等于就能写出很好的作品。尤其因为解放区的作者们都是很年青的，老作家也是年青的，因为真真写工农兵也才是开始，生活经验固然少，而文学修养也很差，战争的频繁、激烈，交通的不便，出版物缺少，工作的需要，使我们不能安定下来好好地学习一阵，研究一阵，写点东西也是很忙地，因此写作不能有很精密的计划，和必须有的较从容的时间；但我们是要在一方面完成任务，一方面是从学习实践锻炼的里面来逐步提高我们作品质量的。因为各种条件的关系，至今创作中存在着许多问题，有的是已经解决了的，有的是还待解决，甚至这还是一个急须要讨论和又不容易一时解决的问题。
    一、选择主题。是根据解决当前的工作任务与群众运动的实际问题。因为广大群众在政治上解放了，他们不只要有文艺生活，也迫切要求教育指导，要求告诉他们怎么办，所以我们必须适时及时的给他们以东西解决他们的需要。群众等不及我们在生活中去慢慢消化，去作什么永久打算，我们要做到，现在群众需要什么就写什么，而且力求写得好。这样写行不行？我说行。假如问题写得深刻，解决的正确，有很大教育意义；假如问题是一般的问题，又是严重的问题，那末就有普遍的教育意义，如果一个作品能起很大的很普遍的教育作用，为什么不是好作品呢？
    二、真人真事与典型人物。我们不特不反对写真人真事，而且还提倡过的。为什么要这样提，是不是不要写典型人物呢？不是的。我们所说的写真人真事不是什么人都写，什么事都写，是写典型人物的典型事例。这种人大都是群众中的英雄人物，他本人和他的英雄事迹就带着很大的典型性。写了这些人，对现实、对群众有很大的教育意义。而且去了解这些人去写这些人，对于作者也是一种很好的学习。但我们并非满足于真人真事，我们要求更典型、更完整的人物与事迹，我们也向着这方面努力，也有不少作品达到了这种要求。
    三、集体主义精神。解放区作者不管是老作家或新作家，写工农兵都是新作家，都缺乏完备的条件；因此我们不反对个人创作，但必须发扬集体主义精神，就是在写作以前，要有提纲，要说明你想写什么，要解决什么问题，要开座谈会，研究你的企图是否正确，你的观点是否正确。写好之后，又广为搜集意见，重复讨论，再三修改，有些戏是排好了又重写，经过几次三番，如果不合群众意思，如果不是很好，也就仍然不拿出来，凡是较好的作品，一般都经过了这条道路，因为作品不是属于个人的，而是属于人民的，应该采取这种慎重的态度，作家也应该有这种听取批评和修改作品的态度。
    四、语言问题。老百姓的语言是生动活泼的，他们不咬文嚼字，他们不装腔做势，他们的丰富的语言是由于他们丰富的生活而产生的。一切话在他们说来都有趣味，一重复在我们知识分子口中，就干枯无味，有时甚至连意思都不能够表达。我们的文字也是很定型化了的那末老一套，有的特别欧化，说一句话总是不直截了当，总是要转弯抹角，好象故意不要人懂一样，或者就形容词一大堆，以越多越漂亮，深奥的确显的深奥，好象很有文学气氛，就是不叫人懂得，不叫人读下去。因此我们不特要体会群众的生活，体会他们的感情，而且要学习他们如何使用语言，用一些什么话来表现他们的情感的，这个人不同，那一个人又不同。我们要很好的去学，要学的自然，不是生硬的搬用，不是去掉一些装腔做势的欧化文字，而又换上一些开杂货铺似的歇后语，口头语，一些不必要的冷僻的方言。我们是要用群众语言，来丰富自己的文章，而又要再去丰富群众的语言的。
    五、形式问题。我们提倡向民族的民间的形式学习，因为这个是为群众所熟习，所习惯的形式，为群众所喜闻乐见。而且也只有用这种形式，从这种形式中发展、提高了的形式，更容易深入群众，更容易打倒封建的文艺。但我们也吸收一切外国来的优良的有用的传统，在创作上一切科学化了的创作方法，须要学习，尤其是苏联文学的经验和特点，值得好好学习。
    六、经过专家审查也经过群众审查。专家的审查是须要的，因为他看问题的确是内行，他容易看出问题的所在，他会给作者以很多业务上的帮助；但也必须把作品拿到群众中去，听取群众的意见，因为既然是写他们给他们看，是为他们服务，那末他们究竟须要不须要，满意不满意，自然是很重要的，他们的意见自然应该放在我们考虑问题的第一项。
    我们所走过来的路，还是万里长征的第一步，尤其因为我们大批人是从旧的小资产阶级过来的，虽然以后的条件是更好了起来，有毛主席共产党的领导，有人民军队人民政府的帮助，有广大群众给我们的帮助，有新民主主义政治、经济、文化各方面条件的配合；但还有很多旧社会的影响要时时来侵袭我们，我们自己的残余的，或者刚死去的旧意识旧情感都会有发展，有死灰复燃的可能，我们要时时警惕着，兢兢业业，坚持为人民服务的方向，为工农兵的方向，坚持着一种朴素的、埋头的、谦虚的、谨慎的作风，为发展生产，建设工业而服务，努力下去，贯彻到底，使我们的文艺的花朵开遍全中国，那末我们就还要向着以下的方向而努力。
    一、深入生活，较长期的生活，集中在一点。以前由于环境不同，使我们流动太多，以后就有可能了。我们不只要熟悉他们生活，而且还要熟悉他们的灵魂，要带着充分的爱护他们，关心他们，脑子中经常是他们在那里活动，有不可分的联系，这样我们就可以运用自如了。当我们要说到他们的时候，就象对于家里人那样清楚，就可以达到如同在我们口袋里掏出我们的日用品那样的自然和轻松。
    二、学习马列主义和党的政策。我们的作品有一些常常赶不上群众的要求，有的刚写好就觉得没有什么用处了，有的作品在当时有作用，过一阵，很短的一阵，几个月，一年，两年，这个曾经教育过群众的作品的寿命也完了。问题过时了。这个道理在那里，那就因为我们的文艺工作者缺少马列主义，不够了解政策，了解的是些表面的问题，他所了解的问题，常常也只是随着当时的一般人的见解，是毫无预见的，因此只敢实录一些现象，不敢深入问题，不敢对当时当事有所批评。因此故事也很好，生活也有，语言也不坏，可是思想性不够，政治性不尖锐，战斗性不强烈，这样的作品，他即使在当时显得有作用，也不会是很大的，更不可能有更长更大的价值了。作家应该有较一般工作者政治水平高，对当时当地的工作有进一步，比较深刻的看法，他不仅能反映当时生活的战斗的情况，而且要指出那生活的本质是什么，加以分析和批评，对正确那面，对光明那面加以无限的热情，这样才能达到教育人、感化人，把人们的理想和情感更提高一步。为要达到作品能够这样，那末就只有学习马列主义，只有它能够告诉我们如何去分析社会上的各个阶级的相互关系，和在变动中的情况，矛盾，发展，它帮助我们分析社会，帮助我们掌握社会发展的方向，预见社会发展中发生的问题，和应该怎样去解决它。如果我们没有这把标准尺，我们是无法衡量客观的现实生活的。
    三、有计划有组织有领导有批判的学习西洋文学，尤其是学习苏联文学，以及中国文学的优良传统，更要学习研究民间形式。以前我们读书很少，又总是各人摸索各人的路，分工不科学，也不交换意见，没有机会各人把自己的心得供献给人家；我们现在实在应该是有组织有计划的进行研究和学习，要告诉文艺工作者、读者什么是好，什么是坏，怎样去学，学些什么，把经验整理出来，供献给大家。
    四、有组织有领导的发动创作。过去对创作的领导是不够的，我们有很多有才能的写作者，但大半都很年青，从各方面来讲，修养是不够的，他们埋头在下面，在生活上，写作上都尽了很大的力，他们有一些较好的作品，但他们还要求提高，他们须要有人帮助。帮助他们如何整理材料，如何组织更好，要求帮助他们加强作品中的政策性，给作品灌入以正确而坚强的思想，如何总结他的生活经验和创作经验，这样才会使大家有信心来坚持这一个艰巨的工作，也的确才会逐渐使作品不只在量上而且也是在质上满足群众对文艺的要求。我以为这还必须有这种组织机构，和专门的负责人。
    五、培养青年的作家和工农兵作家。今天是一个大创作的时代，现代的中国随处都充满着可歌可泣、动人心魄的伟大的生活。而且人民是智慧无比，他们本身就是人民的英雄，他们的情感充实，感觉锐敏，他们对创作是热情而大胆，他们常常能创作出新鲜、泼辣、生气勃勃，抓紧了人民跳动的脉搏，喊出了人民的心声的。我们常常可以看到这样的作品，的确这是在一群赋有天才的人民大众的作家的手创，但这种人材如果不去注意他，培养他，他就会如同一朵花因为自然的气候，或者旁的原因被埋没下去。他写东西本来是偶然的，或者不写了，或者又写了不及以前的东西，慢慢他的情绪又低了。他是非常需要有人注意他，鼓励他，帮助他的。这些人，我们也应该不只是说说，而是要有专人肯于埋头踏踏实实的做这种工作。
    六、改造旧艺人。这些人对旧社会生活相当熟习，对民间形式掌握得很好，有技术，有创作才能。他们缺乏的是新的观点，对新生活新人物不熟悉，他们却拥有听众、读者。时代变了，人民虽然不需要那旧内容，但他们却喜欢这种形式，习惯这种形式，所以我们要从积极方面，从思想上改造这些人。帮助他们创作，使他们能很好的为人民服务。
    七、建立批评。我们的批评工作做得很少，许多文艺工作者须要指导，许多读者也需要批评来帮助他们学习。他们需要对文艺工作，对作品指出方向，明辨是非，评定高低，他们举起双手来欢迎，可是我们没有，我们没有建立起有领导的自由论争和正确的批评。这也可以说对创作关心不够，使作者读者长久是苦闷的处于被冷淡被忽视的情形中。假如缺少正确的批评作为指导，创作是要走许多弯路的。以后我们要展开和建立批评，开座谈会，搜集意见，应该有商量辩论，有较正确的结论。要认识这是寻求真理，领导文艺工作，向群众负责的态度，而非牵涉个人荣辱，宗派意气。一个真真为人民服务的作家，应该养成一种真真的，一切为工农兵的，冷静的，客观的忘我的大气概。
