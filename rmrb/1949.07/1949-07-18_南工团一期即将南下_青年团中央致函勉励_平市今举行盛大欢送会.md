    The First Phase of the Southbound Work Corps is About to Go South
    The Central Committee of the Youth League Sends a Letter of Encouragement
    A Grand Send-off Rally Will Be Held in Ping City Today
    [Ping City News] The first group of graduates from the Southbound Work Corps is about to go south. The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League yesterday (the 17th) sent a special letter of encouragement, as follows:
    You are about to go south to join the People's Liberation Army and march towards the areas in the south of the Yangtze River awaiting liberation. Most of you are young people, and you represent the new generation of China. With boundless courage and determination, you are going to the army and to the people in the south of the Yangtze River. We believe that you will definitely do a good job in mass work, gloriously complete various combat tasks, and contribute your greatest strength to the complete victory of the People's Liberation War and the construction of a new people's democratic republic. In these struggles, study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought well, and strengthen yourselves so that you can better serve the people in the future. We wish you victory.

Eight organizations, including the Beiping City Student Federation, the Youth Federation, the Youth League Preparatory Committee, the City Federation of Trade Unions, and the City Women's Federation, have formed the "Beiping City All-Circles Send-off Southbound Work Corps Preparatory Committee," and a grand send-off rally will be held today. In addition to the students of the Southbound Work Corps and their families, participants will also include university and middle school students, young workers, young women, primary and secondary school teachers, etc., estimated to be around 30,000 people. The broad masses of students in Ping City deeply admire the revolutionary determination and heroic spirit of the Southbound Work Corps to liberate South China and have launched a letter-writing campaign to comfort and encourage them.
