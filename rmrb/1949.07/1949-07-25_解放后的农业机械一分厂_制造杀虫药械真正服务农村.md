　　The Agricultural Machinery Factory No. 1 After Liberation
  　Manufacturing Insecticide Machinery to Truly Serve the Countryside
    [Report from this newspaper] The Agricultural Machinery Factory No. 1 of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, under the general direction of the head factory to develop agricultural mechanization, is tasked with manufacturing agricultural insecticides, fungicides, and related machinery.

    Before liberation, this factory was nothing more than a decoration established in North China by the pseudo-Kuomintang government, lacking any real substance. Only after liberation did it truly receive the support and attention of the People's Government. In the past half year, through the allocation of more than 100,000 jin of insecticides and fungicides and several hundred sprayers by the agricultural sector to various regions of North China, it has solved a portion of the rural pest and disease problems. Recently, it has also begun repairing damaged sprayers in various regions of North China, repairing and replenishing the unusable sprayers that were left idle in various regions, so that they can return to the front lines of pest control and disease prevention.

    Before liberation, the machinery manufacturing group of this factory had not produced any agricultural machinery. After liberation, all the original master machines were repaired in March and April of this year. In May, they produced five agricultural powder sprayers, and in July production is expected to reach fifty units. It is planned that one hundred units can be produced in September. At the same time, the trial production of sprayers has been successful, and the trial production of 15-horsepower electric rollers is now underway. By the end of this year, it is planned to complete 400 powder sprayers, 500 sprayers, and 60 electric rollers. Currently, all employees are modifying the original machines and creating new tools for new tasks: adding pressure and tampers; manufacturing electric stud welding machines to replace riveting; modifying the poorly functioning two-horsepower electric grinding wheels to double the rotational speed (originally 1,500 revolutions, changed to 3,000 revolutions).

    The pharmaceutical production had been halted before liberation, and the medicine grinding workers were also dismissed. In April, the workers were gradually brought back, and in that month, 2,400 jin of derris powder were produced. In May, this increased to 12,000 jin, and in June, 12,720 jin were produced, exceeding the highest production amount before liberation (10,800 jin). Currently, in response to the call for conservation, the received lime sulfur powder is being tested to make a compound. It is expected that full preparation will begin in a month, which can produce 30,000 jin of compound stock solution, enough for 200,000 trees if used entirely for the prevention and treatment of fruit tree pests and diseases. Other tasks, such as assembling mole cricket poison, designing the manufacturing of rotenone extract and nicotine sulfate, are also underway.

### 解放后的农业机械一分厂　制造杀虫药械真正服务农村

　　解放后的农业机械一分厂
  　制造杀虫药械真正服务农村
    【本报讯】华北农业机械厂第一分厂，在总厂的发展农业机械化的生产总方向下，担任着制造农用杀虫杀菌的药剂和药械的任务。
    这厂在解放前，不过是伪国民党政府设在华北的一个点缀品，并没有实际内容。解放后，才真正得到人民政府的扶助和重视。在近半年来，通过农业部分配了十万斤以上的杀虫杀菌药剂，和几百架喷雾器到华北各区，解决了农村病虫灾害的一部分问题。最近又开始了华北各区废坏喷雾器的修整工作，把各区放置着不能用的喷雾器，加以修理添配，使它仍旧回复到杀虫防病的第一线去。
    该厂制械组，解放前并没有生产过有关农用的任何器械。解放后一切原有的母机，经过本年三、四两月的修整，五月份生产了农用喷粉器五架，七月份生产可达五十架，预定九月份可以生产一百架。同时，试制喷雾器已经成功，现正试制十五马力的电滚子，在本年底，要完成喷粉器四百架，喷雾器五百架，电滚子六十台。现全体职工正改装原有机器，替新任务创造新工具：添设压力、捣子；制造电力钉焊机来代替铆钉的工作；把不好使的二马力电动砂轮，修改后增加一倍的回转速度（原有一五○○回转，改为三千回转）。
    制药工作，在解放前已经停顿，磨药的工人也都遣散，四月份又把工人陆续找回来，当月即生产鱼藤粉二千四百斤，五月份增加到一万二千斤，六月份生产一万二千七百二十斤，超过了解放前生产的最高额（一万○八百斤）。目前为了响应节约，正在将接收的石灰硫磺粉试制为合剂。预计在一个月后即开始全部配制，可以制成三万斤合剂原液，如果全用在果树病虫的防治，够二十万棵树用。其他如装配蝼蛄药水，设计鱼藤精和硫酸尼古丁的制造，都在进行中。
