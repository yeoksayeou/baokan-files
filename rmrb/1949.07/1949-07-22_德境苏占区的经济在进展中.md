　　The Economy of the Soviet Zone of Germany is Progressing
　　Translated by Shen Yu
　　The German Economic Commission, the economic administrative guiding body of the Soviet occupation zone in Germany, recently discussed and approved an economic development plan for the Soviet zone in 1949.

　　In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, wartime industries in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany have been completely dismantled, and all efforts have been concentrated on the development of peacetime industries.

　　Industrial output in 1949 will increase by 16 percent compared to last year. The output of machine building, chemical, optical and electrical machinery manufacturing industries will increase by 20 to 40 percent.

　　This year, the people in the Soviet occupation zone can obtain 145 percent more textiles, 52 percent more shoes, and 40 percent more hosiery than last year. The building materials industry will also produce in large quantities, with brick production increasing by 90 percent. 188,850 houses will be built in cities throughout the occupation zone, and 5,000 new houses will be constructed.

　　Agriculture is also developing rapidly. Grain production in 1948 was 4.1 million tons (only 3.5 million tons in 1946), and potato production was 11.8 million tons (only 9.2 million tons in 1946). Agricultural production will continue to increase in 1949. The number of cattle exceeds 14 percent compared to 1947, and the number of pigs exceeds 45 percent. The number of machine rental stations will also increase.

　　Last year's economic plan in the Soviet occupation zone has been fully realized. There is ample reason to believe that the 1949 plan will be fully realized, and the economy of the Soviet occupation zone will further promote its long-term peaceful and democratic progress.

　　德境苏占区的经济在进展中
    沈予译
    德境苏联占领区的经济行政指导机构——德国经济委员会最近讨论通过了一项一九四九年苏占区的经济发展计划。
    按照波茨坦决议，德境苏联占领区里的战时工业已经完全解除，而已集中一切力量在平时工业的发展上。
    一九四九年的工业产量将比去年提高百分之十六。机器建筑、化学、光学和电机制造各工业的产量将增加百分之二十到四十。
    今年苏联占领区的人民和去年比较起来，可以多获得百分之一百四十五的纺织品，百分之五十二的鞋类，和百分之四十的袜衫类。建筑用物资的工业亦将大量生产，砖的生产可增加百分九十，在全占领区各城市中将修建房屋一八八、八五○所，并新造五千所房屋。
    农业也在大量发展，一九四八年谷类的产量是四百一十万吨（一九四六年仅三百五十万吨），马铃薯的产量为一千一百八十万吨（一九四六年仅九百二十万吨）。一九四九年的农业产量仍将增加。畜牛的数量比一九四七年超过百分之十四，猪的数量超过百分之四十五。机器出赁站的数目也将增加。
    去年苏联占领区的经济计划已经完全实现了，这有充分理由使人相信一九四九年计划必能全部实现，苏联占领区的经济将更促进其和平民主的长足进展。  （译自十八期新时代）
