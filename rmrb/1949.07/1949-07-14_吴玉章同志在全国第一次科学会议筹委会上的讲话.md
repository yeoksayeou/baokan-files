China's economy has been suppressed and bound by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, preventing its development. At the same time, scientific workers have also been suppressed and bound, hindering their progress. Now, the People's Liberation Army has achieved a great victory and will soon achieve victory throughout the country, liberating semi-feudal and semi-colonial China from heavy oppression. This has opened up a new environment for our scientific workers and has also put forward new tasks for them. What are these new tasks? They are the new tasks of economic construction.

The forces of imperialism have been driven out of China. It can be said that China has stood up and gained independence. However, complete and true independence can only be achieved when China's industry is developed and China is no longer economically dependent on foreign countries. China needs to go through a long period of arduous struggle to achieve true economic independence, and this great task falls on the shoulders of our scientific workers.

What is the most urgent thing for scientific workers to do now? First of all, they must unite and organize. In the past, scientific workers were very disunited. The objective reason was that the Kuomintang reactionary government was corrupt, practiced bribery, and excluded dissidents. It gave all interests to American imperialism, causing fatal blows to national capital, and people who advocated justice could hardly survive. Under this environment, it was naturally difficult to unite; the subjective reasons were the various factional struggles within the scientific community, conflicts of personal interests, etc. Especially, there was a lack of consensus in thought and a lack of a correct goal for struggle, thus preventing unity.

Now that the objective obstacles have been removed, and the regime is our own people's democratic regime, we can unite our scientific workers under a common goal and struggle together in this new environment.

Subjectively, true unity can only be achieved when thoughts are unified, will is unified, and there is a correct goal. How can thoughts be unified? It is necessary to understand the laws of the survival and development of things and human society. To achieve this, it is necessary to study the Marxist worldview and outlook on life, that is, to study dialectical materialism and historical materialism, in order to clarify incorrect thoughts, transform thoughts, become a person of the new era, understand the truth of serving the people, and have a correct stand.

What is the common goal? It is to establish a New Democratic People's Republic. "This New Democratic Republic is different, on the one hand, from the old-style, European and American-style, bourgeois-dictatorial, capitalist republic, which is the old democratic republic, a form that is already out of date. On the other hand, it is also different from the latest-style, Soviet-style, proletarian-dictatorial, socialist republic, which is the latest democratic republic, a form that has flourished in the Soviet Union and will undoubtedly be established in all capitalist countries as the ruling form of state composition and political power composition in all advanced countries. However, this type of republic is not yet applicable to colonial and semi-colonial countries in a certain historical period. Therefore, in all revolutionary colonial and semi-colonial countries, the only possible form of state in a certain historical period is the third form, which is the so-called New Democratic Republic. This is a form for a certain historical period, and therefore a transitional form, but an indispensable and necessary form." (Mao Zedong: On New Democracy)

The reason for the difference from the socialist republic lies in the fact that economically backward, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal countries, after achieving political independence, must utilize all urban and rural capitalist elements that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood but not harmful, and unite with the national bourgeoisie to struggle together in order to cope with imperialist oppression and improve their backward economic status. Our current policy is to regulate capitalism, not to eliminate it. However, the direction of our development is socialist, not capitalist. With a common goal, unity can be consolidated and organization can be achieved.

Secondly, work must be intensified. What is before us now is how to rapidly restore production and develop production. Our China, where capitalism has not been greatly developed and the economy is backward, is not without good conditions. First, we have abundant natural resources. Coal and iron are very rich, all kinds of metals are available, and the production of grain and cotton is high. Oil, if developed, will also be considerable. This guarantees that our economy can be greatly developed. Second, we have one-fourth of the world's population—475 million hardworking, intelligent, and bravely struggling people. They can make amazing achievements, such as the accomplishment of repairing the Songhua River Railway Bridge, which amazed any engineer (as shown in the movie "The Bridge"). During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War in the Liberated Areas, although blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek, they relied on their own efforts and made many inventions in military industry and medicine, all of which showed that our young scientists can display their talents. This is an extremely great force. Third, although our industry is small, the large industries are all state-owned and very concentrated, and many have very modern equipment. This is a good foundation for developing a socialist economy. As for agricultural technology, although it is backward, the experience of the Liberated Areas proves that production can be greatly increased with just a slight improvement. With the people's democratic regime, and more importantly, with our Communist Party and Chairman Mao's new thoughts, new theories, new political viewpoints, and new political system, which are supported by the masses of the people, as well as the economic construction of the Soviet socialist and Eastern European new democratic countries as our example, these are all good conditions for us to develop our economy. If our scientific workers can plan and rapidly restore and develop them on the existing industrial and agricultural foundation, our economic prosperity will be rapid.

Since we have a good environment politically and good conditions economically, we must quickly, systematically, step-by-step, and with emphasis develop our new economic construction. Where do we start? I think: First is investigation and statistics. China lacks accurate investigation and statistics in everything. Without this, all construction cannot begin. The investigation is divided into two parts. One is to investigate the existing situation, which is the responsibility of the managers to investigate all enterprises clearly within a limited period. The other is to investigate the undeveloped, that is, what resources are hidden in certain places and what industries are suitable for construction in what places. With accurate materials from investigation and statistics, we can make a three-year or five-year economic construction plan; otherwise, everything is empty talk. Therefore, I believe that the first task of our scientific workers is investigation and statistics.

The second is to cultivate talents. We have too few scientific talents and must cultivate them in large numbers. Not only should we cultivate them in schools, but also in factories, and send them abroad to study. We should compile and translate more foreign books. There are many books on China's economy in various countries, such as Japanese and American books on China's economy, as well as their newly published scientific books and newspapers, which should be translated. We should run several specialized publications for the application and research of students and workers, so that their technology can be improved.

We must master the world's latest science and technology, whether it is invented by the capitalist country America or the socialist country Soviet Union, as long as it is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, we must learn to apply it. However, we must recognize that the direction of our New Democratic economic development is the Soviet socialist direction, not the American capitalist direction.

We must deepen our study, spend a certain amount of time every day to study, not only to study business, but also to study theory, so that theory is linked with practice, especially to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to arm ourselves and to act as a guide for action.

Our conference is not a small and narrow group, but a great union of scientific workers across the country. It is born to adapt to the new era and the new environment. It is guided by the economic program of New Democracy and led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in all aspects. We will surely be able to gloriously complete our tasks.

　　吴玉章同志在全国第一次科学会议筹委会上的讲话
    中国的经济，受了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的压迫和束缚，不能发展。同时，科学工作者也受了同样的压迫和束缚不能发展。现在人民解放军已获得伟大胜利，很快即将在全国获得胜利，把半封建半殖民地的中国从重重压迫下解放出来，这就为我们科学工作者开辟了一个新环境，同时也为我们科学工作者提出了新任务。什么新任务呢？就是经济建设的新任务。
    帝国主义的势力驱逐出中国，可以说中国是站起来了，得到独立了。但必须在中国的工业发展了，中国在经济上不倚赖外国了，才有全部的真正的独立。中国要实现经济上的真正的独立，还需要经过很长的时间和艰苦的奋斗，这个伟大的工作就落在我们科学工作者的身上了。
    现在科学工作者最急迫地要做些什么呢？首先就要团结起来、组织起来。从前科学工作者是很不团结的，客观的原因是由于国民党反动政府贪污腐化、贿赂公行、排除异己。把一切利权送与美帝国主义，使民族资本受到致命的打击，主张正义的人几不能生存。在此环境之下，自然难于团结；主观的原因，则科学界的人有各种派系的斗争，个人利益的冲突等等。尤其是思想不能一致，没有奋斗的正确目标。因此不能团结。
    现在客观的障碍已经去掉，政权已经是我们人民自己的民主政权，我们就可能在这个新环境下把我们科学工作者团结在共同目标之下，共同奋斗。
    主观方面只有在思想统一、意志统一，有一个正确的目标，才能真正团结起来。思想如何才能统一呢？那就要了解事物和人类社会的生存和发展的规律，要做到这一点，就要学习马克思主义的世界观和人生观，就是说，要学习辩证唯物主义、历史唯物主义，才能把不正确的思想澄清，才能改造思想，才能成为一个新时代的人物，才能了解为人民服务的真理，才能有正确的立场。
    共同的目标是什么呢？就是要建立一个新民主主义的人民共和国。“这种新民主主义共和国，一方面与旧形式的、欧美式的、资产阶级专政的、资本主义的共和国相区别，这是旧民主主义的共和国，这种共和国已经过时了。另一方面，也与最新式的、苏联式的、无产阶级专政的、社会主义的共和国相区别，这是最新民主主义的共和国，这种共和国已经在苏联兴盛起来，并且还要在各资本主义国家建立起来，无疑将成为一切先进国家的国家构成与政权构成的统治形式。但是这种共和国，在一定的历史时期中，还不适用于殖民地半殖民地国家之中。因此，在一切革命的殖民地半殖民地国家，在一定历史时期中的国家中的国家形式，唯一的只能是第三种形式，这就是所谓新民主主义共和国。这是一定历史时期的形式，因而是过渡的形式，但是不可移易的必要的形式。”（毛泽东：新民主主义论）
    其所以和社会主义共和国有区别的原因，就在于经济上落后的半殖民地半封建的国家，取得了政治上的独立后，为了对付帝国主义的压迫，为了使落后的经济地位提高一步，中国必须利用一切于国计民生有利而不是有害的城乡资本主义因素，团结民族资产阶级，共同奋斗。我们现在的方针是节制资本主义，而不是消灭资本主义。但是我们发展的方向，是社会主义的而不是资本主义的。共同目标有了，团结就能巩固，就能组织起来。
    其次就要加紧工作。现在摆在我们面前的，就是怎样来迅速恢复生产和发展生产。我们中国，资本主义未能大发展，经济是落后的，但不是没有好的条件。第一，我们有充足的天然富源，煤、铁很丰富，各种金属都有，粮食、棉花的出产很多，石油如开发出来也是不少的，这就保证了我们经济可大大发展。第二，我们有世界四分之一的——四万万七千五百万勤劳、聪敏、英勇奋斗的人民。他们能作出惊人的成绩，如修理松花江铁桥那种成就，使任何工程师都为之吃惊（见电影“桥”所表现）。解放区八年抗战，虽被蒋介石封锁，而自力更生，对于军工、医药有不少的发明，在在都表现了我幼年的科学家能发挥他们的天才，这是一个极其伟大的力量。第三，是我们的工业虽然很少，但是大工业都是国家的，而且很集中，有许多还是很新式的设备，这是发展社会主义经济的好基础。至于农业技术虽然落后，但是以解放区的经验证明，只要稍稍加以改良，就能大大提高生产。我们有了人民民主政权，更重要的是有我们共产党和毛主席的新思想、新理论、新政治观点、新政治制度，为人民大众所拥护，还有苏联社会主义和东欧新民主主义国家的经济建设可作我们的榜样，这些都是我们发展经济的好条件，如果我们科学工作者能在现有的工农业基础上有计划地迅速地把它们恢复和发展起来，我们的经济繁荣将是很快的。
    我们在政治上既然有了好环境，经济上又有好条件，我们就要很快地有计划、有步骤、有重点的发展我们新的经济建设。从何着手呢？我认为：第一是调查统计。中国一切都缺乏确实的调查统计，没有这，则一切建设无从着手。调查分为两部分。一是调查现有的，这就由管理的人负责，限定一个时期，把所有的企业调查清楚；一是调查未开发的，即某些地方究竟蕴藏一些什么富源和什么地方宜于建设什么工业等。有了调查统计的确实材料，我们才能作出三年或五年的经济建设计划，否则一切都是空谈。所以我认为我们科学工作者第一个工作就是调查统计。
    第二是培养人才，我们的科学人才太少了，必须大量地来培养。不只是在学校中培养，而且要在工厂中培养，并送到外国去学习。我们要多编译外国书籍，凡是各国关于中国经济调查的书，如日本和美国关于中国经济的书籍不少，以及他们新出的各种科学书报，都要翻译。要办几种专科刊物，以供学习的人和工作者的应用、研究，使他们的技术得以提高。
    我们要掌握世界上最新式的科学技术，无论它是资本主义国家美国所发明的也好，社会主义国家苏联所发明的也好，只要它有益于国计民生，我们都要去学会来应用。但是要认清楚我们新民主主义经济发展的方向，是苏联社会主义的方向，却不是美国资本主义的方向。
    我们要加深学习，每天要用一定的时间来学习，不仅要学习业务，而且要学习理论，使理论与实际联系，特别要学习马列主义和毛泽东思想来武装自己，来作行动的指南。
    我们的会，不是一个小的狭隘的团体，而是全国科学工作者的大联合。它是适应新时代新环境而产生，它有新民主主义的经济纲领作指导，有中国共产党和毛主席各方面英明的领导，我们一定能够光荣地完成我们的任务。
