Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Fourteenth: TASS Rome reports: The Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress passed a letter at its closing session addressed to workers and trade union members in the US, UK, and other countries whose union leaders have declared their withdrawal from the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The letter points out: As the threat of a new economic crisis in the capitalist world grows daily, monopoly capitalists are intensifying their attacks on the vital interests, rights, and freedoms of working people. Aggressive blocs, led by US imperialism, have been established one after another, and new wars are being prepared. In this situation, working people all over the world need unity more than ever. Not only the welfare of the world but also the fate of the world depends on the unity of working people. However, it is precisely at such a time that the representatives of the central trade union organizations in your countries are undermining the unity of our ranks by not participating in the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress to discuss the most important issues of defending the interests of working people in all countries, and defending peace, democracy, and freedom. Without seeking your opinions, they withdrew from the World Federation of Trade Unions. They maliciously slander the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions and cunningly conceal their own divisive actions. They use this hypocritical way of harming the interests of workers to force you to agree to their destructive work. The leaders of your central trade union organizations and the leaders of the American Federation of Labor are hastily organizing scab unions under the slogan of anti-communism to confront the World Federation of Trade Unions and the democratic trade union movement worldwide.

The letter loudly calls out: Workers, both men and women! You should oppose the establishment of divisive scab unions. You should organize all possible cooperative committees and maintain contact with the World Federation of Trade Unions. Discuss and disseminate the declarations and resolutions of the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress. Demand that your trade union organizations join the International Trade Secretariats (Industrial Departments), which are established by the World Federation of Trade Unions to protect the vital interests of working people in various industries and to organize international cooperation among workers. Workers, both men and women! Strive to bring your trade union organizations back into the ranks of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which firmly defends vital interests, protects the democratic rights of trade unions, and fights for lasting peace and against instigators of war!

　　世界工联号召美英等国工人
    反对工贼破坏团结
  　争取工会组织回到工联
    【新华社北平十四日电】据塔斯社罗马讯：世界工联第二届代表大会在闭幕会上通过告美、英及其他由工会领袖宣布退出世界工联的各国工人与工会会员书。
    该书指出：当资本主义世界新的经济危机的威胁日渐发展之时，独占资本家正在加紧进攻劳动人民的切身利益、权利和自由。以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团先后成立，新的战争在准备中。在这种情形下，全世界劳动人民比以往任何时候更需要团结。不仅世界的福利而且世界的命运也系于劳动人民的团结。但是，正是在这样的时候，你们国家的职工会中央机构的代表们，却破坏我们队伍的团结，不参加世界工联代表大会，讨论最重要的保卫一切国家劳动人民的利益，保卫和平、民主和自由的最重要的问题。他们没有征求你们的意见，就退出了世界工联。他们存心不良地向你们诬蔑世界工联的活动，奸诈地掩盖他们自己的分裂行动。他们用这种虚伪的损害工人利益的办法，硬使你们同意他们的破坏工作。你们的工会中央机构的领袖们和美国劳联的领袖们，正在反共产主义的口号下，匆忙组织工贼工会，用以对抗世界工联和全世界的民主职工运动。
    该书大声号召说：男女工人们！你们应反对成立分裂者的工贼工会。应组织一切可能的合作委员会，与世界工联保持联系。讨论和宣传世界工联第二届代表大会的宣言和决议。要求你们的工会组织加入世界工联为保卫各业劳动人民的切身利益、为组织工人的国际合作而设立的国际各业工会联合会（各业职工部）。男女工人们！争取使你们的工会组织回到坚决维护切身利益，保护工会民主权利，为争取持久和平和反对战争挑拨者而斗争的世界工联的队伍里来吧！
