Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 7th: TASS Sydney, 4th: It is reported that MacArthur Headquarters has decided to adopt more overt methods to suppress the Japanese labor movement. In April, the U.S. occupation authorities in Yokosuka summoned local union leaders and ordered them to have workers fill out specially designed questionnaires. Workers had to answer questions on the form ranging from their height and hair color to the political beliefs of the person filling out the form and the guarantor. Each worker had to sign a statement declaring that he did not belong to the Communist Party or other organizations related to the Communist Party, and was responsible for informing the American occupation authorities of any changes in his status, especially regarding his party affiliation. Although the statement stated that "the signing of this statement is free and voluntary, and no threats, coercion or violence have been used," it was stipulated that those who violated the statement would be subject to criminal prosecution. This move has aroused strong indignation among Japanese workers. Workers refused to fill out this type of questionnaire and refused to sign the statement drafted by the American authorities. In order to suppress this "criminal" behavior of the workers, the American military court sentenced a union leader on June 1st to imprisonment for one to six months and a fine of one hundred US dollars. It is well known that Japanese people cannot obtain US dollars. In this way, the sentenced union leader will be detained indefinitely. All this shows that the American occupation authorities, in violation of the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's decision on Japan's democratic construction, are adopting the methods of pre-Hitler Germany to suppress the Japanese labor movement.

　　麦克阿瑟用希特勒的办法
  　妄图镇压劳工运动
    【新华社北平七日电】塔斯社悉尼四日讯。据悉，麦克阿瑟总部已决定采取更公开的办法镇压日本劳工运动。四月间，横须贺美军占领当局召集该地工会领袖，命令他们叫工人填写特制的调查表。工人必须在表上答复小至身高及头发的颜色，大至填表人及证明人的政治信仰的问题。每个工人都必须签署一张声明书，其中声明他不属于共产党或与共产党有关的其他团体，并负责让美国占领当局知道关于他的地位的任何改变，尤其是关于他的政党关系。虽然声明书上写明“这个声明的签署是自由与自愿的，没有使用威胁，强迫或暴力”，但是对于违背声明的，却规定要受刑事检举。此举已激起日本工人的强烈愤慨。工人们拒绝填写这种调查表，拒绝签署美国当局所拟就的声明书。为了镇压工人这种“犯罪”行为，美国军事法庭于六月一日判处一工会领袖以一到六个月的徒刑及一百美元罚金。人所共知，日本人是无法得到美元的，这样，这位被判刑的工会领袖将被无限期地扣押。这一切就说明：违背波茨坦宣言及远东委员会关于日本民主建设决定的美国占领当局，正在采取前希特勒德国的办法，镇压日本劳工运动。
