Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: Moscow dispatch: A Red Star newspaper observer recently wrote a commentary on the protest movement against the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty, stating: The pact has been signed for more than three months, but signatory countries such as the United States, France, and Italy have yet to ratify the treaty. The observer pointed out that this significant delay naturally does not mean that the ruling groups of these countries do not want to complete the ratification process as soon as possible, but is due to the numerous protests by the masses of people in the signatory countries against the diplomatic policies of the ruling groups of the United States, Italy, and France. The U.S. Senate, House of Representatives, and the President have received many protests demanding that the North Atlantic Treaty not be ratified. These protests come from various strata of the people, including workers, scientists, artists, and writers. In France, as the period for discussing the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty draws closer, a strong popular movement against the ratification of the pact is also surging across the country. This movement includes laboring people from different political views, religious beliefs, parties, and trade unions. In Italy, delegations of people from all over the country are now meeting in Rome, bringing with them petitions signed by the people against the North Atlantic Treaty. Facts have proven that the policy of the ruling groups of the North Atlantic Treaty signatory countries, which aims to unite an aggressive bloc, is being condemned by peace-loving people and all those who advocate the consolidation of universal peace. These people are the overwhelming majority.

　　侵略公约签字国家的统治集团
  　正受到一切爱好和平人民谴责
    红星报观察员著文评论
    【新华社北平十一日电】莫斯科讯：红星报观察家顷著文评论反对批准北大西洋公约的抗议运动称：公约签字已三个多月，但是，象美、法、意这等签字国家，迄今仍未批准该约。观察家指出，这种大大的拖延，自然并不意味这些国家的统治集团不想尽快地完成批准程序，而是由于公约签字国的人民群众对美、意、法统治集团外交政策的无数抗议。美国参众两院和总统接到许多抗议，要求不批准北大西洋公约。这些抗议来自各不同的人民阶层，其中有职工、科学家、艺术家、作家等。在法国，由于讨论批准北大西洋公约的时期愈来愈近，抗议批准该公约的强有力的人民运动在全国也愈加汹涌澎湃。这一运动包括了各不同政治见解、宗教信仰、党派及工会的劳动人民阶层。在意大利，全国各地的人民代表团，现正在罗马会合，他们带来了人民签字的反北大西洋公约的请愿书。事实证明北大西洋公约签字国家统治集团的旨在纠合一个侵略集团的政策，正受到爱好和平的人民和一切赞成巩固普遍和平的人们的谴责。这些人民是占绝大多数的。
