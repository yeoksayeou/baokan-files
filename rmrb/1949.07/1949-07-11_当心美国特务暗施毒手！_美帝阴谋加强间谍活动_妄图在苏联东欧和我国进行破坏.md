Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: Reuters Washington reported: President Truman of the United States signed a bill in late June to strengthen the Central Intelligence Agency, granting the agency supreme power and unlimited discretionary use of funds. This incident shows that the new war planners in Washington are paying increasing attention to espionage as Congress begins to arm the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty. It is widely believed that one of the main tasks of the Central Intelligence Agency, which has obtained new powers and large amounts of funding, will be to promote the military activities and military plans of the United States in guiding the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty. It will take over espionage work in these countries, unify its spy network, stop their mutual reconnaissance activities, and direct them to concentrate their efforts on activities in the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and China. The Central Intelligence Agency was established two years ago. Under the authorization of the President, the agency has established a worldwide underground activity network. The notorious "X Plan" (a despicable plan specifically aimed at inciting rebellion and assassination, assisting anti-communist newspapers, organizing commandos, and assassinating communist leaders in Central and Eastern European countries, with an initial funding of 30 million US dollars) involving the establishment of a UAQ spy network in Central and Eastern European countries is a result of the work of the Central Intelligence Agency. In its work of "unifying" all government espionage activities, the Central Intelligence Agency has established a spy network that links the espionage activities carried out by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, the Department of the Air Force, the Department of State, the Marshall Plan Administration, and other agencies. In addition to receiving reports from specially trained military intelligence officers selected from the Department of State and the Marshall Plan Administration stationed around the world, the Central Intelligence Agency also receives assistance from bankers, industrialists, and right-wing labor leaders. It also welcomes fascist "refugees" to join its underground organizations. In order to help the Central Intelligence Agency further develop contacts with Eastern European countries that have broken away from capitalism since World War II, the latter has helped establish an organization called the "National Committee for a Free Europe." This committee is organized by former State Department officials, industrialists with vested interests in international finance, and labor leaders connected to them. Since Truman signed the bill authorizing the Central Intelligence Agency to cultivate 100 "anti-communist refugees" each year, the committee has taken on a task: "helping the leaders of these 'refugees' keep them in useful occupations when they have to stay in the United States." Members of the International Farmers' Union (Green International) headed by the Polish traitor Mikolajczyk and members of other "peasant parties" in Eastern Europe have joined the Central Intelligence Agency. Former Polish General Moderski testified before the U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee that before he left Poland for the United States to serve as a military attaché at the Polish Embassy, he received a letter of introduction from U.S. Ambassador to Poland Rein to Eisenhower. He stated that he had provided information to American intelligence personnel specially assigned by Eisenhower to contact him. Rein is one of the founders of this new "Free Europe" committee. The leader of the committee is another former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew. The members of the Grew Committee include Farley (former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and owner of the Farley Company), Dulles, Eisenhower, AFL President Green, CIO Secretary Carey, "Time" and "Life" magazine publisher Luce, and the chairman of the U.S. Military Aid to Greece Program Committee, Paul. The work of the Central Intelligence Agency has expanded with the increasing interference of the United States in the internal affairs of other countries around the world. The implementation of the Truman Doctrine in Greece and Turkey and the implementation of the Marshall Plan have given American intelligence personnel a good opportunity to develop their business. As the United States increases its measures to arm the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty, the field for American intelligence personnel to infiltrate the military departments of these countries has become even more widely opened. They need more funds to expand their business, and President Truman has approved giving them an unlimited amount of funds.

　　当心美国特务暗施毒手！
  　美帝阴谋加强间谍活动
    妄图在苏联东欧和我国进行破坏
    【新华社北平十日电】电通社华盛顿讯：美国总统杜鲁门于六月下旬签署了加强中央谍报处的法案，给予该处以无上权力和无限制地任意使用经费之权。这件事表明：华盛顿新战争计划者在国会着手武装北大西洋公约签字国家时，对谍报工作已日益重视。众信：获得新权力与大量拨款的中央谍报处的主要任务之一，将是促进美国指导北大西洋公约国家的军事活动与军事计划。它将要接管在这些国家中的谍报工作、统一它的间谍网，停止它们之间互相侦察的行动，并指挥它们集中力量在东欧新民主国家、苏联和中国进行活动。中央谍报处是在两年前成立的，根据总统的授权，该处已经建立全世界的地下活动网。臭名远扬的涉及在中欧和东欧国家建立ＵＡＱ间谍网的“Ｘ计划”（按系专门从事在苏联及新民主国家煽动叛乱和暗杀、帮助反共报纸、组织突击队及暗杀共产党领袖的卑劣计划，初期经费三千万美元），就是中央谍报处工作的一个结果。中央谍报处在其“统一”一切政府间谍活动的工作中，已经建立了一个和联邦调查局、陆军部、海军部、空军部、国务院、马歇尔计划总署等机关各自进行的间谍活动进行联系的间谍网。中央谍报处除了从国务院和马歇尔计划总署派至全世界各地的精选的受过特别训练的军事情报官员收到报告之外，还从银行家、工业家和右翼的劳工领袖方面得到帮助。它并且欢迎法西斯“难民”参加它的地下组织。后者为了帮助中央谍报处进一步发展对于自第二次世界战争后摆脱资本主义的东欧国家的接触，已经帮助成立了一个叫做“自由欧洲全国委员会”的组织，这个委员会是由前国务院官员与国际财政有利害关系的工业家、以及与他们一脉相连的劳工领袖们组织而成的。自从杜鲁门签字的法案授权中央谍报处每年培植一百名“反共难民”后，该委员会即已担负起一件工作：“帮助这些‘难民’的领袖，在他们不得不停留在美国的时候，把他们保存在有用的职业上。”已经加入中央谍报处一伙的，有以波兰卖国贼米科拉兹柯为首的国际农民联盟（绿色国际）的会员和东欧的其他一些“农民党”的党员。前波兰将军莫杰尔斯基出席美众院非美活动委员会作证时，曾说：在他离波赴美任波兰大使馆武官之前，他接到美国驻波大使雷因给艾森豪威尔的一封介绍信。他表明他曾向艾森豪威尔特派与他接触的美国谍报人员供给情报。雷因是这个“自由欧洲”新委员会的创建人之一。委员会的首领是另外一个前美驻日大使格鲁。格鲁委员会的委员有法莱（按系前民主党全国委员会主席，法莱公司老板）、杜勒斯、艾森豪威尔、劳联主席格林、产联秘书加莱、“时代”与“生活”两杂志的发行人鲁斯，以及美国军事援助希腊计划委员会的主席柏耳。中央谍报处的工作已经随着美国对全世界其他国家内政的干涉而日益扩大。杜鲁门主义在希腊和土耳其两国将实行和马歇尔计划的实施，已经给与美国的谍报人员以开展业务的良机。随着美国增加武装北大西洋公约国家的措施，美国谍报人员渗入这些国家军事部门的园地就更为广大地敞开了。他们需要更多的款项来扩大他们的业务，杜鲁门总统就批准给他们以不限制数目的款项。
