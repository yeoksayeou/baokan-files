  　Convenes Branch Manager Meeting, Establishes Five Major Business Guidelines for the Future
    [Taiyuan Electric] The Taiyuan Trading Company convened a meeting of all district and branch managers to arrange future work. The meeting began on the 23rd of last month and ended on the 26th. Responsible comrades from the company pointed out that since the company entered the city with the army on April 24th, thanks to the correct leadership of the Military Control Commission, the cooperation and assistance of relevant departments, and the hard work of all trade cadres, they basically completed the tasks of purchasing grain and oil in the early stages of military control, ensuring supply, controlling prices, and helping state-owned and private industries resume production. At the same time, some shortcomings were also pointed out, such as insufficient understanding of the situation, which made it impossible to determine a comprehensive plan, resulting in blind and passive business operations. Secondly, insufficient attention was paid to work outside the city. Finally, according to the general policy of trade work of the North China Trading Corporation and the situation in the Taiyuan area, the tasks for July, August, and September were determined: (1) To support industrial production, first of all, to underwrite the products that state-owned industries need to underwrite, and to supply the raw materials that state-owned industries can supply. And use a certain amount of strength to help private industries resume production. (2) Combine the establishment of supply stores and employee consumer cooperatives with state-owned enterprises, and implement quantitative and fixed-price distribution of major necessities for employees, public educators, and their families. (3) The wheat harvest has arrived, and immediately absorb the wheat from farmers by supplying them with an appropriate amount of industrial necessities supplemented by some currency, and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. (4) Continue to support agricultural production, purchase livestock, purchase local products, and inspect the work of supporting agricultural production in the spring. (5) Delineate responsibilities, establish systems, strengthen learning, and gradually establish a regularized and scientific work style.
