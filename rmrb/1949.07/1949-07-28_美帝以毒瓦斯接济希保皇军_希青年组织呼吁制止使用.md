Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 26th: According to the Free Greece News Agency: Poison gas used to attack the Greek Democratic Army was shipped a few weeks ago by several American ships to Piraeus, near Pilamo. In order to avoid detection, these poison gases and other military supplies provided by the United States to the Royalist fascists are unloaded from American ships at night and then transported to Piraeus by Royalist fascist trucks. The entire line of highway from Pilamo to Piraeus is heavily guarded by Royalist fascist police. The Greek Democratic Youth Organization sent a letter to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, pointing out that the US and British governments are supporters of the Athens government's atrocities, and called on the world's youth to rise up in support to stop the realization of the Royalist fascists' new conspiracy to use poison gas.

　　美帝以毒瓦斯接济希保皇军
  　希青年组织呼吁制止使用
    【新华社北平二十六日电】据自由希腊通讯社报道：用以进攻希腊民主军的毒瓦斯，几周前已由若干美国轮船运抵比里犹斯附近的彼拉摩。为了避免被人发觉，美国供给保皇法西斯的这些毒瓦斯及其他军需品，在夜间由美轮上卸下，再由保皇法西斯用大卡车运到比里犹斯。自彼拉摩到比里犹斯的公路全线，都由保皇法西斯的警察严加戒备。希腊民主青年组织曾致函世界民主青联，指出美英政府是雅典政府暴行的支持人，呼吁世界青年群起声援，以制止保皇法西斯企图使用毒气的新阴谋的实现。
