　　[Ji Zhong Electric] Jing Zhequan, a traitor and murderer sentenced to death in Wuqing County and wanted by the North China People's Government, was captured by the people in Feizhuang, Wuqing on the 24th. Traitor Jing once served as the pseudo-mayor of Yangcun Township under the Kuomintang, committing robbery and murder, and all kinds of evil deeds. More than 60 innocent people were thrown into the river and killed by him. His accomplices in the escape were reactionary landlord Yan Xiufeng, who had murdered our village's peasant association representative and arrested our liaison; and habitual bandit Han Zhongzhe, who robbed and killed an innocent cart driver on the road. After the three bandits were captured by the People's Government, they were sentenced to death one after another, ready for execution. However, due to lax guard at the Wuqing County prison, the three bandits escaped from prison on the night of June 17th at 12 o'clock. But because the people of Wuqing were well-organized, the fugitives were all captured one by one. Reactionary landlord Yan Xiufeng was captured by the masses before he could escape outside the city; habitual bandit Han Zhongzhe was captured on the same day by Wang Zhenggang and other militiamen from Nantao Garden and nearby villagers. Jing Zhequan was captured alive by villagers in a shed in Feizhuang. In addition to issuing a circular praising the above villages, the Wuqing County Government also awarded the Nantao Garden militia three rifles and sixty bullets, and the Datao Garden one rifle and twenty bullets.

　　华北人民政府通缉之逃犯
  　荆辙泉已捕获
    【冀中电】华北人民政府通令缉拿之武清县已判死刑汉奸杀人逃犯荆辙泉，已于二十四日于武清费庄被民众捕获。荆逆曾任国民党杨村乡伪大乡长，抢劫杀人，无恶不作，无辜人民被其投河杀害者六十余人。与其伙逃之反动地主阎秀峰，曾杀害我村农会代表，逮捕我交通员；惯匪韩忠哲，路劫杀死一无辜车夫。三匪被人民政府捕获后，曾先后判处死刑，准备执行，因武清县看守不严，该三匪于六月十七日夜十二时越狱潜逃。但由于武清人民组织严密，逃犯都一一被捕获。反动地主阎匪秀峰没跑到城外，即被群众捕获；惯匪韩忠哲当天便被南桃园民兵王振纲等及近村民兵擒获。荆匪辙泉，则在费庄一个草棚里被村民活捉。武清县政府对以上各村除通令表扬外，并奖予南桃园民兵大枪三枝，子弹六十粒，大桃园大枪一枝，子弹二十粒。
