[Jizhong Electric] The victory in the wheat harvest has been achieved in central Hebei, with a total wheat production of 400 million jin. Under the urgent task of rushing to replant seedlings, sowing, and catching and exterminating pests, men, women, old and young helped each other, working day and night to rush the wheat harvest, and all of it was harvested and stored in warehouses before June 20th, taking half a month. In Raoyang alone, eight districts and 125 villages organized 1,372 mutual aid groups, including 5,215 households, a total of more than 10,000 people, who helped each other harvest 32,000 mu of wheat; and harvested 3,660 mu of wheat for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers without labor, shortening the wheat harvest time by one-third compared with previous years. At the same time, widely mobilizing women to participate in the wheat harvest also played a great role. In Wuqi, Anguo and other places in the ninth district, the number of women pulling wheat in the low-lying areas reached more than 85%, and in 125 villages in Raoyang, more than 20,000 women were mobilized, exceeding the number of men harvesting wheat by more than 1,000 people. During the wheat harvest, reactionary landlords, secret agents, and lawless elements attempted to steal wheat, burn fields, and incite the looting of wheat to sabotage the wheat harvest. However, due to the close attention of the leadership in various places and the joint defense patrols of militiamen and the masses, no major theft or robbery incidents occurred, ensuring the safe and victorious wheat harvest. This year's wheat fields suffered from various disasters such as drought, hail, and insects, resulting in a poorer harvest than in previous years. The ninth district was better, with an average yield of 110 jin per mu for watered land and an average of more than 40 jin per mu for dry land, with an average of 88 jin per mu for the entire district. The tenth district had a lower harvest due to less watered land, and the eighth district was the lowest, with an average yield of 34 jin per mu. In order to save and prepare for famine, farmers in various places are exchanging wheat for coarse grains or mixing wild vegetables to eat.

　　冀中胜利完成麦收　全区产麦四万万斤
    【冀中电】冀中胜利完成麦收，总计产麦四万万斤。正当突击补苗播种和捕灭虫害的紧急任务下，男女老幼插伙互助，日夜不停突击麦收，于六月二十日前半月的时间，全部收打入仓。仅饶阳八个区一百二十五个村，就组织起互助组一千三百七十二个组，包括五千二百一十五户，共一万多人，互助收麦三万二千亩；并给无劳动力的烈军工属收麦三千六百六十亩，麦收时间也比往年缩短三分之一。同时广泛发动妇女参加收麦，也起了很大作用。九专区无极、安国等地，下洼拔麦的妇女达到百分之八十五以上，饶阳一百二十五个村，发动妇女两万余人，超过男子收麦人数一千多人。在麦收期间，反动地主、特务不法分子，企图偷麦烧场及煽动抢麦破坏麦收，但由于各地领导上密切注视和民兵群众联防巡逻，没有发生大的偷抢事件，保证了麦收的安全胜利。今年麦田因受到旱、雹、虫等多种灾害，较往年歉收。九专区较好，水地平均每亩产一百一十斤，旱地每亩平均四十多斤，全专区平均每亩八十八斤。十专区因水地较少收成较次，八专区最低，总平均每亩产麦三十四斤。为了节约备荒，各地农民正以小麦换粗粮或打野菜掺着吃。
