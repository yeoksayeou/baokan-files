Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 21st: The North China Electric Power Company is carrying out publicity and education and inspection work among the masses to overcome the electricity theft by a small number of citizens in Tianjin and Beiping. Electricity theft is a bad habit left over from the Kuomintang rule, which has a great impact on future electric power construction. According to statistics, the amount of electricity stolen in Tianjin each month accounts for 20% of the electricity sold by the Tianjin Branch of the North China Electric Power Company. According to the statistics in May, the amount of electricity stolen in Beiping also accounted for 8% of the electricity supplied by the Beiping Branch of the North China Electric Power Company. This not only greatly affects the cost of electricity and increases the burden on legitimate electricity users, but also hinders the full supply of electricity for industrial use. In May and June, Tianjin has uncovered more than 500 cases of electricity theft and recovered 660,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. Efforts are still being made to gradually eliminate electricity theft. The North China Electric Power Beiping Branch has formed a "Anti-Electricity Theft Movement Promotion Committee" to mobilize citizens to launch an anti-electricity theft movement. The company plans to first carry out publicity work, calling on citizens to cherish people's enterprises, and calling on electricity thieves to register voluntarily, and the company will not pursue their past electricity theft. Citizens who report electricity theft will be rewarded. In addition, the company is also preparing to conduct a general inspection, and those who do not stop electricity theft will be severely punished once found.

[This newspaper] The "Anti-Electricity Theft Movement" promoted by the North China Electric Power Beiping Branch is gradually developing. The company conducts publicity through radio stations and sending propaganda vehicles and Yangko teams to major streets inside and outside the city, and sends letters to various agencies, factories, and groups in the city of Beiping to jointly promote the work, hoping to start from themselves and play a leading role among all citizens. Now the Municipal Government, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Federation of Students, the District Offices, and the Public Security Sub-bureaus are studying specific ways to cooperate. The Public Security Sub-bureaus of the four outer districts have completed the deployment of the anti-electricity theft movement. In addition to stepping up inspections, each police station has decided to hold mass meetings regularly to convey the significance of the anti-electricity theft movement, listen to citizens' opinions on the Beiping Branch of the Electric Power Company, and investigate and understand the number of households in the entire district that have not installed electric lights and the reasons why they cannot install lights. Since the 17th, the Electric Power Company has sent propaganda vehicles and Yangko teams to major streets in the city for publicity. In the past five days (until the 21st), the total number of listeners has been more than 16,000. Some citizens have initially realized that the anti-electricity theft movement is to protect their own enterprises and protect their own interests, and then respond with practical actions. For example, Gu Jianju, a user next to No. 1 Zhenjiang Hutong, Inner District 1, reported to the company on the second (18th) day of the anti-electricity theft movement that the meter he used (left by the previous tenant) was running very slowly and did not know if there was any electricity theft. He requested an inspection. The company immediately sent personnel to conduct a detailed inspection and found that a copper wire about two inches long was installed inside the meter, so that most of the current did not pass through the meter coil. Therefore, the meter was running very slowly, which was indeed a method of electricity theft. In order to encourage citizens to respond enthusiastically to the anti-electricity theft movement, the company commended Gu Jianju's voluntary report, and exempted him from repaying the company's losses due to the slow meter, and replaced it with a new meter free of charge.

[Another dispatch] The company convened all employees on the 18th to hold a mobilization meeting for the anti-electricity theft movement. At the meeting, the company representatives, managers, and the director of the Anti-Electricity Theft Movement Promotion Committee reported on the reasons for the anti-electricity theft movement, its significance, the organization of the committee, and the work plan. The representative also called on all employees to first conduct a self-examination of whether their own electricity consumption is illegal; starting from themselves, extending to relatives, friends and neighbors. Finally, Comrade Gong Jianmin of the Staff and Workers' Union called on all employees to respond to the administrative call, and proposed the recent electricity theft incident of Zheng Yongzeng, a technician of the company, to alert everyone. Zheng Yongzeng confessed his guilt on the spot. In order to educate all employees and himself, the company decided to give Zheng a public criticism. It also stated that if the same incident occurs again in the future, it will be dealt with severely.

　　广泛宣传深入检查发动自报
  　平津窃电现象逐步消除
    【新华社北平二十一日电】华北电业公司在群众中开展宣传教育与稽查工作，以克服平津两市少数市民的窃电行为。窃电现象为国民党统治所遗留下来的恶习之一，对今后电业建设影响极大。据统计，天津市每月被窃电量占华北电业天津分公司售电量的百分之二十。北平市据五月份统计，被窃电量亦占华北电业北平分公司供电量的百分之八。这不仅大大影响电的成本与加重正当用电户的负担，且妨碍对工业用电的充分供应。天津市在五六两月中已查获窃电案五百余件，追偿电力六十六万度。现仍在继续努力，以求逐步消除窃电现象。华北电业北平分公司已组成“反窃电运动推进委员会”，发动市民展开反窃电运动。该公司拟首先进行宣传工作，号召市民爱护人民企业，并号召窃电者自动登记，公司对其以往窃电行为可不予追究。对检举偷电者的市民，将给予奖励。此外该公司亦准备进行普遍检查，对不停止窃电行为者一经查出将严加处理。
    【本报讯】华北电业北平分公司所推动的“反窃电运动”，正在逐步开展中。该公司通过广播电台及派宣传车秧歌队赴城内外各主要街道进行宣传，并函请平市各机关、工厂及团体共同推进工作，希望能由自身做起，在全体市民中起带头作用。现市府、市职工总会筹备会、市学联、各区公所、公安分局等正在研究配合工作的具体办法。外四区公安分局已把反窃电运动工作布置完毕。各派出所除加紧检查外，并决定定期召开群众大会，传达反窃电运动的意义，听取市民对于电业公司北平分公司的意见，调查了解全区未装按电灯户数及其不能装灯的原因。电业公司自十七日起派宣传车及秧歌队赴城内各主要街道宣传，五天来（至二十一日止）听众总计一万六千余人。部分市民已初步认识了反窃电运动就是为了保护自己的企业，保护自己的利益，进而以实际行动来响应。如内一区镇江胡同一号旁门用户顾间菊于反窃电运动的第二（十八）日，即自动到该公司报告他用的电表（前住户遗留的）走得很慢，不知是否有窃电情形，请求检查。该公司随即派员前往详细检查，发现电表内部装有长约二寸的铜线一条，使大部分电流不经电表线圈，因此电表走得很慢，确系窃电的一种方法。为了鼓励市民热烈响应反窃电运动，该公司对顾间菊的自动报告予以表扬，对于因为表慢而使公司受到的损失免予清还，并免费另换新表。
    【又讯】该公司于十八日召集全体职工开了一个反窃电运动动员大会。会上该公司代表、经理及反窃电运动推进委员会主任委员分别报告反窃电运动原因、意义、委员会组织情形及工作计划。代表并号召全体职工首先自行检讨自己用电是否有不合法的情形；由本身作起，推及亲友及邻居。最后职工会弓鉴民同志号召全体职工响应行政上的号召，并提出最近查获的该公司技工郑永增窃电事件来警惕大家。郑永增当场坦白悔过。该公司为了教育全体职工及其本人，决定对郑给予当众批评的处分。并提出今后如再有同样事件发生，一定严加处理。
