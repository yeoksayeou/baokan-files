　　Tangshan People's Government Provides Loan Assistance
　　Desheng Pottery Company's Output Increases Monthly
　　[Tangshan Electric] Under the assistance of the Tangshan People's Government, the Desheng Pottery Company has rapidly resumed production. The production situation in June was good. Based on the output in the first half of the month, it is estimated that the total monthly output will be about 20 tons of porcelain and 400 tons of firebricks, reaching the highest production level since liberation. The company was founded in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. During its peak in the thirty-third year of the Republic of China, the factory had about 1,800 employees, and all 38 kilns were in operation, producing more than 1,000 tons of firebricks and more than 160 tons of porcelain per month. Before the Japanese surrender, it was forced to shut down. When it勉强 resumed work in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, there were only 220 employees. Under the oppression of the Kuomintang bandits, the output and sales gradually decreased, and production fell into a state of intermittent operation. In November of last year, it could only barely maintain the production of 13 tons of porcelain and 150 tons of firebricks. After the liberation of Tangshan, all the shareholders left, and the workers' lives were extremely difficult. The People's Government successively provided assistance with loans totaling 750,000 yuan and 800 tons of coal. The factory's funds were able to circulate, and the output gradually increased. It is estimated that in March, 18 tons of porcelain and 190 tons of firebricks were produced; in April, 14 tons of porcelain and 150 tons of firebricks were produced. The number of employees has also increased from 227 at the time of liberation to 455. Recently, the factory's products have sold very well. As of now, orders for firebricks have been placed by: Yongli Alkali Factory in Tanggu, Tianjin Zhongfang, Beiping Shijingshan Power Plant, and other units, with a total quantity of more than 1,390 tons. Due to the leadership and education of the Communist Party and the Trade Union, the workers' awareness and production enthusiasm have been unprecedentedly improved, and their labor attitude has also undergone significant changes. For example, in the past, it took 80 to 90 hours to fire a porcelain kiln, but now it only takes 65 hours to fire, and the color does not decrease; each kiln can save 3 tons of coal. In the past, it took more than 300 hours to fire refractory bricks, but now it only takes 170 hours, saving 7 tons of coal. Recently, a medical room was established in the factory, and the factory is also preparing to build 50 workers' dormitories. There is a bathroom in the factory, and employees can bathe once a week. In addition, issues such as maternity leave for female workers before and after childbirth, and the payment of wages during leave, have been resolved. In the past, apprentices in the factory could only become master craftsmen after three years, and they did not receive wages for three years, only meals; now, the period has been shortened to half a year, and the daily wage is six jin of millet. Since May, workers have organized a staff and workers' school, with 110 people participating in the study. In addition, organizations such as wall newspapers, correspondence groups, and clubs have been established, and the cultural and entertainment activities of the staff and workers have become unprecedentedly active.

　　唐山人民政府贷款扶助
  　德盛窑业公司产量逐月增加
    【唐山电】唐山德盛窑业公司在人民政府扶助下迅速恢复生产。六月份生产情况良好。根据上半月的出产量估计，全月份可出瓷二十吨左右，火砖四百吨，达到解放以来的最高生产水平。该公司创始于民国十九年，民国三十三年最盛时期，全厂职工达一千八百人左右，三十八座窑全部开工，每月可出产火砖一千余吨，瓷器一百六十余吨。日本投降前被迫停工，民国三十五年勉强复工时，仅有职工二百二十人，在国民党匪帮压榨下，产量销路日渐减缩，生产陷于时停时开状态。去年十一月份仅能勉强维持出产瓷器十三吨，火砖一百五十吨。唐山解放后，股东全部离去，工人生活异常困难。人民政府先后共贷款七十五万元，煤八百吨，予以扶助，厂方资金得以周转，产量即逐步提高。计三月份出瓷十八吨，火砖一百九十吨；四月份出瓷十四吨，火砖一百五十吨。职工人数也由解放当时的二二七人增加到四五五人。最近该厂出品销路很好，截至目前为止，订购火砖的计有：塘沽永利碱厂、天津中纺、北平石景山发电厂等单位，数量已达一千三百九十余吨。由于共产党与职工会的领导与教育，职工觉悟程度与生产情绪空前提高，劳动态度也有了显著变化，如烧瓷窑在过去需要八十至九十小时才能烧成，现在则只需六十五小时就能烧成，成色并不降低；每窑可省煤三吨。烧耐烧砖以往需要三百多小时，现在只需要一百七十小时，可省煤七吨。最近厂内建立了一个医药室，厂方并正准备建立工人宿舍五十间，厂内设有浴室，职工每周可入浴一次。此外女工生产前后的休假，工资照发等问题，都得到解决。过去该厂学徒三年才能出师，三年不发工资，只管吃饭；现在则缩短为半年期满，每天工资六斤小米。五月份以来，工人组织了职工学校，有一百一十人参加学习。此外并举办了壁报、通讯小组及俱乐部等组织，职工的文化娱乐空前活跃起来。
