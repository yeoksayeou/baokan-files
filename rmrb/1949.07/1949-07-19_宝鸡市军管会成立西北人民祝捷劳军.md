    [This newspaper's dispatch] According to a broadcast from the Xi'an People's Broadcasting Station on the 18th, the Baoji Military Control Commission and the People's Municipal Government were officially established on the 16th of this month and have begun various takeover operations. Thanks to the assistance of workers, students, and the broad masses of citizens in Baoji, and the bravery and wisdom of the People's Liberation Army, the city was quickly captured, preventing the Hu bandits from carrying out any destruction before they fled in disarray. Except for the destruction of two bridge piers on the Sichuan-Gansu Highway, all large and small factories, enterprises, and buildings in the city are intact. The liberated workers and citizens greeted the People's Liberation Army with smiling faces on the streets. The Renminbi is now circulating in the market.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, Broadcast on the 17th] Xi'an News: After the news of the great victory of the People's Liberation Army on the Northwest Front spread, people from all over the Northwest wrote letters to Deputy Commander Peng and all the officers and soldiers of the First Field Army, expressing their congratulations and condolences. At the same time, they expressed their hope that the People's Liberation Army would annihilate the Hu-Ma bandit troops as soon as possible and liberate the entire Northwest. The market in Xi'an is stable, prices have fallen, and many shops are preparing to expand their business.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, Broadcast] Xi'an, 18th News: The Preparatory Committee of the Xi'an Municipal Democratic Women's Federation called on women and people from all walks of life in the city to enthusiastically comfort the First Field Army and the North China Corps of the People's Liberation Army, which recently annihilated four armies of Hu bandits. In addition to calling for a response to the "Letter of Comfort" campaign initiated by the National Democratic Women's Federation, the committee also launched the organization of a comfort delegation to visit the logistics department and field hospitals to comfort the gloriously wounded officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and pay their respects. On the 14th, the women's comfort delegation sent 19 representatives carrying a large number of comfort items and letters of comfort to visit the logistics department and field hospitals to comfort the gloriously wounded officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and pay their respects.
