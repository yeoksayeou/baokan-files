    [This Newspaper's Report] The gasoline partial distillation boiler of the Jiucheng Glycerin Factory, under the Desert Company belonging to the Public Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government, caught fire on the evening of February 3 this year. Although the main cause of the fire was poor design, poor management was also an important factor. The factory director, Shi Xixian, repeatedly failed to implement the resolutions to establish fire prevention personnel, implement a periodic tool inspection system, and install double steam pipes on the glycerin department's boiler, despite repeated inspections and urging from the company, thus outwardly complying but inwardly opposing. When the distillation boiler started trial operation, he neither made preparations beforehand nor reported to the company, and he himself did not go to inspect it at the time, and he also summoned engineer Wang Lun to a meeting. The company's manager, Li Fusheng, although he repeatedly urged Factory Director Shi to implement the resolutions, did not adhere to principles and there was a lack of unity and disagreements between them, and this situation was not reported to higher authorities in a timely manner. The boiler design was jointly carried out by engineer Wang Lun and Manager Li, and approved by Li, so Shi and Li should both bear the main responsibility in design and management. After the fire, they failed to deeply reflect and deal with it in a timely manner, and have been delaying it until now, which shows that the manager and factory director have not yet recognized the seriousness of their mistakes and their responsibilities. In view of such a numb and indifferent bureaucratic style and the phenomenon of lack of organization and discipline, the North China People's Government has decided to deal with it severely: Factory Director Shi Xixian will receive a demerit of major order; Manager Li Fusheng, because he had not been at the factory long and had not yet accepted production leadership work, will be given lenient criticism and punishment for educational purposes.

　　沙漠公司旧城甘油厂
  　拖延处理失火事件
  　经理厂长同受处分
    【本报讯】华北人民政府公营企业部所属沙漠公司旧城甘油厂汽油部分馏锅炉于本年二月三日晚失火，失火主要原因虽由于设计不良，但管理不善亦为重要原因。该厂厂长史希贤，经公司一再检查督促，终不执行建立防险员与定期的工具检查制度及甘油部锅炉装双汽管的决议，阳奉阴违。分馏锅炉开工试验，事前既不准备，又不报告公司，当时自己也不去检查，且又将工程师王纶召来开会。该公司经理李复生虽曾多次督促史厂长执行决议，但未坚持原则，彼此有意见，不团结，此种情况亦未及时向上级反映。该锅炉设计系工程师王纶与李经理共同进行，并经李批准，所以在设计与管理上，史、李二人均应负主要责任。在失火后，未能深刻检讨，及时处理，一直拖延至今，足见该经理、厂长尚没有认识到其所犯错误之严重性与自己应负之责任。似此麻木不仁的官僚主义作风，及无组织无纪律现象，华北人民政府决定从严处理，厂长史希贤记大过一次；经理李复生因到厂不久，尚未接受生产领导工作，从宽予以批评处分，以资教育。（光）
