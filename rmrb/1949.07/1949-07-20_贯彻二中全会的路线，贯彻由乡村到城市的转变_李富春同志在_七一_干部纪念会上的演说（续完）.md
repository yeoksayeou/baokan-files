Implement the Spirit of the Second Plenary Session, Implement the Transition from Rural to Urban Areas
Comrade Li Fuchun's Speech at the "July 1st" Cadre Commemoration Meeting (Continued)

Second, in the past, the environment was simple, requiring a "one-size-fits-all" approach, but now the situation is complex, requiring "playing the piano."

The Northeast now has both rural and urban areas, agriculture and industry, donkeys and railways, domestic commerce and foreign trade. In terms of class relations, there are more friends, and the internal and external situations are more complex, with diverse forms of class struggle. In short, the situation is complex, so not only are policies becoming more complex—such as economic policies needing to consider all aspects, none of which can be neglected—but also the work itself is becoming more complex. Therefore, our work cannot be like in the countryside, "one-size-fits-all," grasping everything at once, focusing on only one thing at a time while relaxing on others. Now, we must have a comprehensive coordination with a focus, like playing the piano, with all ten fingers working together with different degrees of emphasis and urgency, rather than just one finger. Like a complex machine, every screw must play its role. That is to say, the Party, government, military, and people must earnestly establish committees at all levels, implement the organizational principle of democracy and centralism, require division of labor and responsibility, be planned and accurate, have strong organization, and rely on the organization to promote work and solve problems, with everyone fulfilling their duties, rather than relying on individuals. It requires having a working system and working order, strictly adhering to them, rather than being busy all day without a clue. In this regard, we are still far from making the necessary changes. We are still using handicraft-style working methods, so work efficiency cannot be improved, planning is insufficient, and accuracy is even less to be expected, which hinders the progress our work should have.

Third, past work could be sweeping and widely promoted, but now work requires meticulousness and delving into professional skills.

In the past, in the countryside, the environment was simple, and it was also a time of frequent warfare, with rapidly changing situations. Therefore, our work was accustomed to being sweeping and widely promoted. This sweeping style easily fostered in our comrades a rough and "close enough" mentality. Today, the situation is complex, and the tasks are heavy. We need to carry out meticulous industrial construction work, and we must not be satisfied with rough estimations and general leadership. Instead, we need to delve into professional skills, have prepared plans, concrete leadership, and meticulous organizational work. After policies and plans are determined, to ensure their realization and exceeding, we must rely on the strict organization of every implementation process, specifically study the problems discovered during implementation, and propose solutions, and timely summarize experience to promote work. Being satisfied with a "close enough" result cannot solve the problems. Therefore, we must advocate a work style of deep thinking and in-depth detail. We must promote self-criticism and criticism to deeply study and discover problems, and improve our work, and oppose complacent and stagnant conservative thinking.

Fourth, in the past, we were accustomed to a supply system without budgeting, but now we need economic construction and economic accounting.

In the past, in the rural and wartime environment, we were accustomed to a supply system without budgeting in life and production, and in doing work, we only sought to complete tasks without considering how much money was spent. Now, we need to transition to large-scale economic construction, and we must implement economic accounting. Using the habit of a supply system without budgeting to engage in industrial construction means not calculating labor costs, not calculating raw material usage, and not calculating costs, resulting in significant waste in production and shocking losses of state property. Therefore, we must establish an economic accounting system and a quota system. Completing the production task but wasting labor and state capital and raw materials does not count as completing the task. Even in personal life, we must overcome the egalitarian viewpoints generated by the supply system, adhere to the principles of "no work, no food" and "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," and overcome the viewpoint of "whether you work or not, you get one and a half catties." Today, we must gradually change from a supply system to a wage system. The egalitarianism that exists in today's wage system still stems from the viewpoint of handling the wage system from the perspective of the supply system, starting from ensuring that a certain number of people can be supported, rather than from the principle of "to each according to his work" and developing production. This is wrong.

The above four points are the main aspects in which we need to change our work style. But in order to adapt to the new situation and new tasks, not only must our work style change, but also our organizational form. Today, we are preparing to redefine staffing and re-establish work and life systems. This is not based on the viewpoint of streamlining administration in the countryside in the past, nor is it simply reducing a few people from the original organizational structure, nor is it purely from the perspective of saving financial expenditure. The most important thing is that the situation and tasks have changed, and the organizational form must adapt to it and change accordingly. Therefore, our principle of reorganizing organizational forms today is based on the following two points:

1. The focus of work has shifted from rural to urban areas, requiring centralization and unification, requiring economic construction to be the center, and other work must serve economic construction. From this perspective, we must consider the organizational form. Some we must enrich and strengthen, and some we must change. For example, the current urban organizational structure must be changed. For example, Tianjin has abolished district and street governments and strengthened the work of public security bureaus, sub-bureaus, and police stations. This change is worth studying and learning from. If factories, schools, etc., are still institutionalized and militarized, instead of being suitable for the needs of factories and schools, they must be changed. In addition, none of our organizational structures should be large, have too many levels, or have too many people doing too little, so that they become bureaucratic institutions and styles without realizing it.

2. In the future, we will transition from a wartime environment to construction. The current organizational form and staffing are still formed and left over from the long-term war in the past, which is suitable for wartime requirements but not suitable for today's construction requirements. For example, the staffing and division of labor of rural district and township organizations are suitable for the wartime situation at the time. Now, they should be re-equipped and divided appropriately to suit the requirements of production and cultural and health construction. Furthermore, the organizational form of the military's organs is also suitable for the needs of the tense war at that time, so there are large logistics organs. Now that it is a garrison environment, and the task is mainly training, followed by alert, there is no need for such a large logistics organ. Other political and administrative organs should make appropriate changes based on this change. For example, in the past, it was common to march and fight during wartime, and it was in an inconvenient rural environment, so there were many service personnel and the guard system developed day by day. Every factory, institution, and school needed guard troops. Now that the situation has changed, there is no need for guards, and the number of service personnel should be greatly reduced. Many guards can be withdrawn and the work of preventing spies strengthened to replace them. There are many similar problems. The past decentralized rural wartime organizational forms and staffing are no longer suitable for the current situation and requirements in the Northeast. This is not only about reducing idlers and saving financial expenditure, but also about improving work efficiency, so it must be changed.

The task of the Northeast Party in the future is significant, glorious, and arduous. Restoring and developing the industry of the Northeast is an important condition for moving towards national industrialization. We must shoulder this new task, but we still lack the necessary experience and knowledge, so we must learn humbly, and make a thorough transformation in our thinking and style, and must not have any complacency or a sense of ease. Only by working diligently and diligently can we accomplish this great task. Our Party, after twenty-eight years of arduous struggle, overcoming various serious difficulties, and learning various forms of struggle, finally defeated the enemy and achieved today's brilliant victory. We believe that as long as we closely rely on the masses, learn humbly, and truly and correctly implement Chairman Mao's and the Second Plenary Session's line, we will definitely be able to overcome any difficulties encountered in economic construction and achieve even greater victories in the future. Let us shout:

Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live the new China led by the proletariat!

    贯彻二中全会的路线，贯彻由乡村到城市的转变
    李富春同志在“七一”干部纪念会上的演说（续完）
    第二、过去是环境单纯，要“一揽子”，现在则是情况复杂，要“弹钢琴”。
    东北现在有乡村有城市，有农业也有工业，有毛驴也有铁路，有内地商业也有对外贸易，在阶级关系上朋友多了，内部、外部的情况复杂了，阶级斗争的形式多样性了。总之，情况复杂了，故不仅政策随之复杂，如经济政策要照顾四面八方，缺一不可，工作也随之复杂了。所以我们的工作不能象在农村那样，“一揽子”，一把抓，一个时期只搞一件事，其他可以放松，现在必须是要有重点的全面配合，象弹钢琴那样，十个指头轻重缓急协同动作，而不是一个指头弹。象一架复杂的机器一样，螺丝钉都要发挥其作用，这即是说，党政军民要认真建立各级委员会制，贯彻民主而又集中的组织原则，工作要求分工负责，有计划性，准确性，有坚强的组织，依靠组织去推动工作，解决问题，各尽职责，而不是依靠个人。要求有工作制度工作秩序，严格遵守，而不是终日忙碌毫无头绪。在这点上我们转变得还相当的差的。还是手工业式的工作方法，因此，工作效率不能提高，计划性不够，准确性更谈不到，这就阻碍了我们工作应有的进展。
    第三、过去的工作可以大刀阔斧，面的推广，现在的工作要求精雕细刻，钻研业务。
    过去在农村中，环境简单，加以又是频繁的战争时期，情况变化快，因此我们的工作习惯于大刀阔斧，面的推广。这种大刀阔斧的作风，容易养成我们同志粗枝大叶的“差不多”的观点。今天情况复杂了，任务繁重了，我们要进行细致的工业建设工作，决不能满足于大概的估计与一般的领导，而需要钻研业务，需要有准备的计划，有具体的领导，有细密的组织工作。当政策、计划确定之后，要保证他的实现与超过，就要靠严密地组织每一个执行过程，具体钻研执行当中所发现的问题，并提出解决问题的办法，及时的总结经验推进工作。满足于差不多的一点点效果，是不能解决问题的。因此我们要提倡深思熟虑，深入具体的工作作风。要提倡自我批评与批评去深入研究发现问题，改进工作，反对自满自足、停顿不前的保守思想。
    第四、过去习惯于供给制度不打算盘，现在要经济建设经济核算。
    过去在农村与战争环境，生活与生产上习惯于供给制度不打算盘，做工作只求完成任务不讲花钱多少，现在要转入大规模的经济建设，就必需实行经济核算。拿供给制度不打算盘的习惯去从事工业建设，便不去计算劳动力，不计算原材料使用，不算成本，结果生产上浪费很大，国家财产损失惊人。因此，一定要建立经济核算制、定额制。完成了生产任务。但浪费了劳动力浪费了国家的资本及原材料，那不算完成了任务。即拿个人生活来说，也要克服供给制产生的平均主义观点，坚持实行“不劳动不得食”的原则，以及“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的原则，克服那种“干不干，一斤半”的观点。我们今天必需逐渐由供给制改变为工薪制。今天工薪制中存在的平均主义现象，来源还是以供给制的观点来处理工薪制，是从保证能养活几口人出发，而不是从“按劳取酬”发展生产的原则出发，这是错误的。
    以上四点是我们在工作作风上要改变的主要方面。但为了适应新的情况与新的任务，不仅工作作风要改变，组织形式也要改变的，今天我们正准备重新确定编制，重新确定工作与生活制度，这不是从过去在农村中的精兵简政的观点出发的，也不是简单地照原有组织机构减少几个人，也不是单纯从节省财政开支出发。而最主要的是情况任务变化了，组织形式要与其适应，要随之改变。因此我们今天改变组织形式的整编原则，是根据下面两点出发：
    一、工作重点由农村转到城市，要求集中统一，要求以经济建设为中心，其他工作要为经济建设服务，从这一观点出发来考虑组织形式，有的我们必须充实加强，有的我们必须改变，如现行城市组织机构就必须改变。如天津市将区街政府都取消了，而加强公安局、分局、派出所的工作，这一改变很值得供我们研究参考与学习，如工厂学校等仍然是机关化、军队化，而不是适合工厂与学校需要，均需改变。另外我们的任何组织机构决不要庞大，不要层次太多，不要人浮于事，以至变成官僚主义的机构与作风而不自觉。
    二、今后由战争环境转入建设，现行组织形式及人员配备还是过去长期战争中形成并遗留下来的，是适合于战争要求而不适合于今天建设的要求，如农村区乡组织人员配备和分工，都是适合当时战争情况，现在，就应适合生产的要求及文化卫生建设的要求，重新加以适当的配备与分工。又如军队的机关组织形式，也是适合当时紧张战争需要而建设的，因此有庞大的后勤机关，现在是驻军环境，任务以训练为主，其次为警戒，便不需要有那样大的后勤机关。其他司政机关都要根据这一变化而作适当的改变。如过去战时常要行军作战，又处在交通不便的农村环境，因此勤杂人员配备很多，警卫员制度一天天发展，每个工厂机关学校均要警卫部队，现在情况变了，警卫人员就不需要了，勤杂人员该大大减少了。许多警卫可以撤消而加强防奸工作以代之。诸如此类问题很多。过去的分散的农村的战时的组织形式及人员配备，已不适合于今日东北的情况要求。这不仅是减少闲杂人员，节省财政开支，而且可以提高工作效率，因此必须改变。
    东北党今后的任务是重大的，光荣的，又是艰苦的。恢复与发展东北的工业，是走向全国工业化的一个重要条件。我们必须担负这一新的任务，但是我们还缺乏必要的经验与知识，因此我们要虚心学习，要进行思想上作风上的彻底转变，不能有任何骄傲自满或苟且偷安的情绪。要兢兢业业，努力工作，才能完成这一伟大的任务。我们的党经过二十八年的艰苦斗争，克服了各种严重的困难，学会了各种斗争形式，终于战胜了敌人，获得今日的辉煌胜利。我们相信，我们今后只要紧紧地依靠群众，虚心学习，真正正确地执行毛主席及二中全会的路线，我们一定能够克服在经济建设中所遭逢到的任何困难，取得未来更大的胜利的。让我们高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    无产阶级领导的新中国万岁！
