　　Beiping Automobile Repair Factory Party, Government, and Labor Union Unified Leadership
  　Launches Democratic Self-Criticism Movement
    Listens to Mass Opinions to Improve Organization and Work
    [Our Dispatch] Workers and staff at the Beiping Automobile Repair Factory (formerly the 409 Automobile Factory), while studying the documents of the Factory Management Committee, initially recognized the importance of democratic factory management. To enable workers and staff to more deeply understand their position as masters of the factory, the administrative, Party branch, and labor union jointly organized a study committee to provide unified leadership and conduct a democratic self-criticism movement, listen to mass opinions, and correct all shortcomings in work that hinder worker unity and production. The work style of leading cadres in various departments was also examined and criticized. After two worker symposiums and one staff symposium, the opinions of more than one-third of the factory's workers and staff were collected. Based on these opinions, a general meeting of all workers and staff was held on the 29th of last month, at which administrative and labor union leaders made preliminary self-criticisms: (1) Since the factory was taken over, administrative leaders, due to their focus only on taking over and neglecting management, failed to formulate normal production plans. Many problems, such as production, materials, machinery, wages, and housing, were not resolved in a timely manner, nor were they explained. (2) Since the factory was taken over, waste and theft have been very serious. Production focused on quantity rather than quality, labor discipline was lax, and some staff members were uneasy and perfunctory, all of which caused losses to the factory. (3) The work of the labor union has not been fully developed or deepened. Only labor insurance, propaganda, education, and security work have made relatively good progress, while other youth league organizations and general affairs work have been very dull. Problems raised by the masses have not been answered or resolved in a timely manner, and the masses are dissatisfied with the labor union. At the meeting, the administration also emphasized that the factory will move toward enterprise-based management in the future. The current losses of the factory were pointed out with specific figures, arousing the attention and concern of the masses. In order to conduct in-depth inspection, the group's self-criticism was subsequently arranged. During the self-criticism, the workers criticized themselves and each other from all aspects of labor attitude and production discipline. Finally, the Study Committee summarized the reports of the groups and convened a general meeting of all workers and staff on July 4th, at which Chen Lei, the factory's political commissar, conveyed the summary, clearly pointing out: (1) Workers expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the current factory still retains the old production organization, unreasonable personnel allocation, and production management system, and demanded reforms. Organizationally, they requested the addition of a laboratory and a technical department. (2) They requested the establishment of a Factory Management Committee as soon as possible to implement democratic management, require staff and cadres to be responsible and integrated with the masses, and value the opinions of the masses. (3) Everyone requested strengthening the leadership of political, cultural, and technical learning. (4) They requested solving problems such as housing, welfare, and wages. (5) In production work and labor discipline, rewards and punishments must be clear and fair. Finally, the summary emphasized that everyone's demands are to run the factory well and are completely in line with Chairman Mao's instructions for the development of production. The factory's new organizational structure and the principles for promoting cadres were discussed and announced. For the original staff, according to the factory's production needs, anyone who can take on what position can put forward opinions, but it was emphasized that this is not an election of cadres, but a review and recommendation, and the final decision-making power still belongs to the higher level. This democratic review is carried out by three parties: senior staff group, general staff group, and worker group. This strengthened the workers' sense of ownership, and it is expected that this important work can be completed within a week.

　　北平汽车修配厂党政工统一领导
  　开展民主检讨运动
    听取群众意见改进机构与工作
    【本报讯】北平汽车修配厂（原四○九汽车厂）职工在学习工厂管理委员会文件的过程中，即初步认识了工厂管理民主化的重要；为了使职工更深刻认识主人翁的地位，行政、支部与工会三方面共同组织了学习委员会，统一领导，进行了民主检讨运动，听取群众意见，纠正一切妨碍职工团结与生产的工作缺点。对于各部门领导干部的工作作风，也予以检查和批评。经过二次工友座谈会和一次职员座谈会，搜集了占全厂职工三分之一以上人员的意见。根据这些意见，上月二十九日召开了全体职工大会，行政工会领导干部都作了初步的自我检讨：（一）本厂接管以来，行政领导干部由于思想上只着重接，忽视了管，没有作出正常的生产计划。有许多问题如生产、器材、机具、工资、房子等都没有及时解决，也没加以解释。（二）本厂自接管以来，浪费偷盗现象很严重，生产重量不重质，劳动纪律松驰，某些职员不安心，因循马虎，都造成工厂的损失。（三）工会的工作没有全部展开，也不深入。仅劳动保险、宣教保卫工作比较有进展，其他青工组织、总务工作都很沉闷。群众提出来的问题也未及时答复解决，群众对工会不满。大会上，行政上又着重说明了工厂今后要走向企业化的经营，对于目前工厂的亏累，用具体数字指明，引起群众的重视和关心。为了深入检查，随即布置了小组的本身检讨。检讨中，工友们把本小组的领导干部和自己从劳动态度、生产纪律各方面进行了自我批评与互相批评。最后学委会归纳了各小组的汇报，在七月四日召集了全体职工大会，由本厂政委陈雷传达总结，明确指出：（一）工友对于目前工厂中仍然保存着旧的生产组织，人事配备与生产管理制度不合理等表示不满，要求加以改革，在组织上要求增加化验室、技术室。（二）要求尽速成立工厂管理委员会，实行管理民主化，要职员干部负责任，与群众打成一片，要重视群众的意见。（三）大家要求加强对政治文化和技术学习的领导。（四）要求解决房子、福利、工资等问题。（五）要在生产工作上，劳动纪律上赏罚严明。最后，总结中强调说明，大家的要求是为了把工厂办好，是与毛主席的指示的发展生产方针完全一致的。并讨论公布了本厂的新组织机构，与提拔干部的原则。原有的职员，根据工厂的生产需要，谁能担任什么，可提出意见，但强调这不是选举干部，而是审查推荐，最后的决定权仍属上级。这个民主审查由高级职员组、一般职员组和工友小组三方面进行。这使工友们加强了主人翁的感觉，预计周内可以完成这一重要工作。
