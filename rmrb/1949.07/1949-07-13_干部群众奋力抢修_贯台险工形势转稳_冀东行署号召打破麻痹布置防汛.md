　　Cadres and Masses Strenuously Repair the Breach
    Situation at Guantai Perilous Project Turns Stable
  　Jidong Administrative Office Calls for Overcoming Complacency and Arranging Flood Prevention
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] The Yellow River Guantai Perilous Project, which was once in a state of emergency, has become stable after vigorous repairs. From late June to the 3rd of this month, the Guantai Perilous Project was violently impacted by the upstream flow, causing the dam revetments and protective banks to sink and erode rapidly, creating a very dangerous situation. The Quhe water conservancy team and the local government led the masses in strenuous rescue efforts for several days. Responsible cadres from the Yellow River Commission and the Second Water Conservancy Office rushed to the scene one after another to establish an emergency command headquarters and vigorously lead the masses in transporting materials for repairs. Thanks to the efforts of the cadres and the masses, 500,000 jin of materials and 200,000 jin of straw were quickly transported. As materials were used as soon as they arrived, when 200,000 jin of materials were used, the repair speed finally exceeded the erosion speed, making the dam revetments and protective banks that had sunk into the water rise more than one meter above the water. The dangerous situation has become moderate. However, since the area is a quicksand bottom, it is still difficult to ensure that problems will not occur in the future. Therefore, labor and materials are being rushed to continue repairs.
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] The flood season began on July 10th, and the water level of the Yellow River has been rising continuously. According to the Yellow River Hydrological Station, the water level rose every day from the 1st to the 7th, and began to fall on the 8th. At 16:00 on the 6th, the water level at Shanzhou rose to 293.63 meters, the highest water level in recent days. At 16:00 on the 8th, it dropped to 293.54 meters.
    [Tangshan Telegram] In order to strengthen flood prevention work, the Jidong Administrative Office convened a flood prevention meeting on the 4th, which lasted for four days and has now concluded. The meeting pointed out that although there are many favorable conditions for this year's production, there was a drought this spring, and there may be concentrated rainfall in summer and autumn. The dikes and embankments of each river have not been compacted, the quality inspection system has not been thoroughly implemented, and the flood prevention organization has no foundation. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome all complacency and waiting and see attitudes, and specifically stipulate: 1. From July 1st to September 10th is the flood season, and the areas along the main rivers should focus on flood prevention work; 2. No breaches are allowed when the water level is less than five centimeters from the top of the dike. The middle and lower reaches should vigorously defend, and the mountainous areas should call on the masses to plant trees during the rainy season and build more flood interception dams; 3. Implement the principle of unified leadership and division of responsibility. The Administrative Office has established a general headquarters, with the Jiyun and Luanhe command headquarters under it. Key counties and districts have established county and district command headquarters, which are responsible at different levels; 4. Make good preparations, conduct in-depth publicity and education, and organize all manpower and materials to avoid being caught off guard in the event of danger; 5. Clarify responsibilities and divide responsibilities by section. Treat flood prevention as a major political task for the Party, government, army, and people; 6. Flood prevention burden is mainly the responsibility of the local area, and expenses are uniformly raised and paid by the county to prevent waste.
    [Jinan Telegram] The Xiajin Gouhe dike has been successfully completed. The county is bordered by the Grand Canal to the west and the Gouhe River runs through the middle. It was breached in both 1947 and 1948, causing disasters. In order to prevent summer floods, the county government convened a meeting of district and village cadres on the 13th of last month to arrange for dike repair, calling on everyone to mobilize the masses and accurately calculate so as not to waste a single labor force. The county established a command headquarters, and the districts and villages formed brigades and teams respectively, under unified leadership and division of responsibility. Construction officially started on June 20th. The command headquarters exchanged experiences and commended models at any time; the district and village cadres took good care of the food and lodging of the workers, and everyone's work enthusiasm was extremely high. The dike is 1,030 zhang long, and after four days of assault, 3,974 workers were used and 29,126 cubic meters of soil were used, and it was all completed on the 23rd.

　　干部群众奋力抢修
    贯台险工形势转稳
  　冀东行署号召打破麻痹布置防汛
    【冀鲁豫电】一度告急的黄河贯台险工，经过大力抢修，形势已趋稳定。从六月下旬至本月三日，贯台险工由上大溜顶冲，坝埽及护沿，掏刷而急剧下蛰，形势非常危急，曲河修防队与当地政府，领导群众连日奋力抢救，黄委及第二修防处的负责干部，均先后赶到，建立抢险指挥部，大力领导群众运料抢修。由于干部群众的努力，很快的运到材料五十万斤，秸料二十万斤。随到随修，当用去二十万斤料时，抢修的速度终于超过了掏刷的速度，使蛰陷入水的坝埽与护沿出水一公尺多高。危急的形势转趋和缓。但该处系流沙底，今后仍难确保不出毛病。故仍赶运工料，继续抢修。
    【冀鲁豫电】七月十日伏期开始，黄河水位连续上涨。据黄河水文站报告，从一日至七日，每日上涨，至八日开始回落。六日十六时陕州水位上涨至二九三点六三公尺，为数日来最高水位。八日十六时降至二九三点五四公尺。
    【唐山电】为加强防汛工作，冀东行署于四日召开防汛会议，历时四天，已告结束。会上指出今年生产虽有不少有利条件，但今春天旱，夏秋可能雨量集中，各河堤埝均未夯打，亦未彻底执行验工制度，防止组织又无基础，因此必须打破一切麻痹等待思想，具体规定：一、自七月一日至九月十日为防汛期，沿各主要河流两岸地区均以防汛为中心工作；二、水位在堤顶五公寸以下，不准决口。中下游应大力防守，山地应号召群众雨季造林与多搭拦洪水坝；三、贯彻统一领导，分段负责的原则。行署成立总指挥部，下设蓟运、滦河两指挥部，重点县区成立县区指挥部，分级负责；四、作好准备工作，深入宣传教育，组织一切人力物力，以免临险措手不及；五、明确职责，分段负责。把防汛当成党政军民的重大政治任务；六、防汛负担，主要是地方负责，以县为单位统一筹支，防止浪费。
    【冀南电】夏津沟河堤胜利竣工。该县西临运河，中穿沟河前年和去年均决口成灾。为防夏汛，县政府于上月十三日召开区村干部会议，布置修堤，号召大家发动群众，精确计算作到不浪费一个民力。县成立指挥部，区村则分别组成大队、小队，统一领导分工负责。于六月二十日正式动工。指挥部随时交流经验，表扬模范；区村干部对民工的饭食住宿照顾周到，大家工作热情极高。该堤全长一零三零丈，经四天突击，用工三九七四个，用二九一二六方土，于二十三日全部竣工。
