Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 14th—According to a report from the "Pravda" special correspondent, as cited by TASS: Although the delegation from the New China to the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress was unable to attend the congress due to the obstruction of imperialists, reactionaries, and their running dogs, the report by Liu Ningyi, the head of the Chinese delegation, read on their behalf by the Australian representative, still made the voice of the New China's trade union resound throughout the assembly hall, arousing warm and loud cheers from the delegates. The assembly's cheers for this absent reporter were a striking testament to the unwavering solidarity and militant unity of the working people. The meeting where the Chinese representative's report was heard demonstrated that all obstructions by the reactionaries could not prevent the significant progress of the world trade union movement in uniting.

　　新中国职工会声音响彻世界工联会场
  　刘宁一报告书激起响亮欢呼
    【新华社北平十四日电】据塔斯社引真理报特派记者报道：新中国出席世界工联第二届代表大会的代表团，虽然在帝国主义、反动派及其走狗阴谋诡计的阻扰下，未能出席大会，但是，由澳大利亚代表代为宣读的中国代表团团长刘宁一的报告，仍然使新中国职工会的声音响彻了大会会场，激起了代表们热诚与响亮的欢呼。大会对于这位缺席的报告人的欢呼，实是劳动人民不可动摇的休戚与共及其战斗性的团结一致的显著明证。聆听中国代表报告的那一次会议，显示出反动派的一切阻挠，都阻止不了世界职工运动团结一致的显著进展。
