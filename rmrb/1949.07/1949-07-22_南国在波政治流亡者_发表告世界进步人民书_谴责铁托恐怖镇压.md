　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st— Polish News Agency dispatch: Yugoslav political exiles in Poland recently issued an open letter to progressive people of the world, exposing the unprecedented terror prevailing in Yugoslavia and condemning Tito and his Trotskyist group for turning Yugoslavia into a new base for imperialist aggression. The political exiles are appealing on behalf of the thousands upon thousands of fighters who have been tortured to death in Tito's concentration camps. The letter stated: Thousands upon thousands of people have been imprisoned or executed by the Tito group simply because they voiced opposition to Tito's betrayal of the country and demanded the restoration of friendly relations with those countries fighting for peace and democracy. In one week in March, six hundred people were arrested in Belgrade. In the Sombor concentration camp alone, there are eight thousand Communist Party members. The letter concludes by pointing out: The Yugoslav working class is waging a heroic struggle against the Tito group. Concentration camps exist throughout the country, including near Belgrade.
