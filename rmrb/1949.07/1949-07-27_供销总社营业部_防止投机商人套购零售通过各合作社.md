　　General Cooperative Society Sales Department
  　Preventing Speculative Merchants from Profiteering Through Retail Sales via Various Cooperatives
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal General Cooperative Society Sales Department (located on Xidan North Street), since its official opening on June 29th, in addition to supplying daily necessities to various consumer cooperatives in the city, initially also had a retail department, widely supplying all members of the various consumer cooperatives. Non-cooperative members could also purchase a portion. However, it was soon discovered that speculators were bulk buying goods from the society and reselling them for profit, resulting in fewer purchases by members of the various cooperatives. To correct this phenomenon, the society revised its methods, limiting retail sales to members of consumer cooperatives registered with the General Cooperative Society, who could purchase with their cooperative membership cards. Subsequently, another issue was discovered: some speculative merchants were borrowing the membership cards of cooperative members to make bulk purchases. To safeguard the legitimate interests of cooperative members and prevent speculation, the society recently revised its methods again, ceasing over-the-counter retail sales and focusing exclusively on wholesale to various consumer cooperatives. Members of consumer cooperatives can make purchases through their respective cooperatives. Agencies, organizations, schools, etc., that have not organized consumer cooperatives can make collective purchases from the society by sending a letter, and can enjoy some low-price preferential treatment.

  　防止投机商人套购零售通过各合作社
    【本报讯】北平市供销合作总社营业部（地址在西单北大街），自六月二十九日正式营业以来，除供应本市各消费合作社日用品外，初期并有零售部门，广泛供应凡参加各消费合作社的社员，非合作社社员亦可购买一部分。但不久即发现有投机者套购该社物资，转卖图利，各合作社社员购买的反而较少。为纠正此现象，该社会改订办法，只限于经合作总社备案的各消费合作社社员可向该社营业部零购，凭合作社社员证购买，嗣又发现弊端，有投机商人借用各合作社社员证前往套购。该社为维护合作社社员正当利益，防止投机，最近又改订办法，停止门市零售，专办向各消费合作社批发，凡参加消费合作社的社员，可通过合作社转买。未组织消费合作社的机关、团体、学校等，则可备函向该社集体采购，可享部分低价优待。
