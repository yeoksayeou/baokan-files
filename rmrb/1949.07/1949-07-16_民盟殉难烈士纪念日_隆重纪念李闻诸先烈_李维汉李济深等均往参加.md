    Memorial Day for Martyrs of the China Democratic League
    Grand Commemoration of the Late Pioneers Li, Wen, and Others
    Li Weihan, Li Jishen, and Others Attended
    [Ping Municipal News] Yesterday (the 15th) was the Memorial Day for the Martyrs of the China Democratic League (CDL). At 9:00 AM, the CDL Headquarters Temporary Working Committee and the Peiping Municipal Branch jointly held a memorial meeting in the auditorium on the 6th floor of the Beijing Hotel. In addition to many CDL members, Lin Boqu, Li Weihan, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Peng Zemin, Shi Liang, Tan Pingshan, Cai Tingkai, Chen Qiyou, Zhu Xuefan, Shen Yanbing, Zhang Xiruo, Xie Bangding, Qi Yanming, Yan Baohang, Chen Shaoxian, Chen Cisheng, Li Xijiu, Ouyang Yuqian, Xu Deheng, Xue Yu, Qian Duansheng, Jian Bozan, Ye Shengtao, Rong Zhaozu, Huan Xiang, Wang jin, Zang Kejia, Sun Qimeng, Ke Ling, Bai Yang, and over two hundred others attended. Gao Zhen, the widow of Wen Yiduo, and Zhang Manjun, the widow of Li Gongpu, also attended. Wu Ping, the widow of Zeng Wei, arrived in Peiping a few days ago but was unable to attend due to illness.
    The memorial meeting began with a silent tribute to the martyrs. Shen Junru, as chairman, reported on the life stories and circumstances of the martyrdom of the six pioneers: Li Gongpu was an executive member of the CDL and deputy director of the Democratic Education Committee, assassinated by KMT secret agents in Kunming on July 12, 1946. Wen Yiduo was an executive member of the CDL and head of the Propaganda Department of the Kunming Municipal Branch, also assassinated by KMT secret agents in the streets of Kunming three days after Li Gongpu. Tao Xingzhi was a standing committee member of the CDL and director of the Democratic Education Committee, who died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Shanghai on the morning of the 25th of the same month. Du Binheng was a standing committee member of the CDL and chairman of the Northwest General Branch, shot and killed by Chiang Kai-shek's Hu Zongnan bandits in Xi'an on October 7, 1947. Huang Jingwu was a member of the Central Organization Committee of the CDL and a member of the Shanghai Municipal Branch, and Zeng Wei was a member of the Central Organization Committee of the CDL. Both were kidnapped and murdered by Chiang's secret agents before the liberation of Shanghai. Shen Junru also announced that the CDL has organized a committee responsible for handling the memorial cemetery, memorial hall, and raising living expenses and education fees for the families of the martyrs, to comfort the martyrs and fulfill the responsibilities of those who survived.
    Li Weihan was first invited to speak. He believed that today's memorial day is not just a memorial day for the CDL. The martyred pioneers sacrificed themselves for the cause of the people, and all democratic parties and the Chinese people should commemorate them. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the CDL has sacrificed not only Mr. Li, Wen, Tao, Du, and the other six, but the number must be even greater. He suggested that a detailed investigation should be carried out. He then said that he was either familiar with Mr. Li Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, Tao Xingzhi, Du Binheng, and others, or knew about their experiences. He pointed out that their spirit is worth learning from. First of all, they were connected with the masses, not above the masses. In their minds, the first priority was the masses, not individuals, not small groups. They interacted with the masses and moved forward with them. A person who sees the masses, sees the people, and starts from the people may be great. As Mr. Tao Xingzhi said: "One person falls, and tens of thousands stand up." If a person can only see his own nose and eyes, then he must be insignificant. The greatness of the martyrs, which is worth learning from, lies in the fact that they have always grown up among the people and dedicated themselves to the people. Their thinking did not stop in one place, did not stop at the education they received in the past, did not stop at their background, and did not stop at their past achievements. Their thinking has always been advancing. Their ideological progress is also due to being united with the people because only the masses are the real driving force of historical progress. Being united with the masses, putting the people first, the mind will surely continue to move forward. Because of this, in politics, when many people were still wavering, they clearly distinguished between the enemy and the friend, did not lose their way at the turning point of history, and became an advanced warrior in the course of history. Li Weihan concluded by saying that the enemy is about to collapse completely, but there are still residual forces and imperialism. There will still be many difficulties in construction in the future. We must learn from the spirit of Mr. Li, Wen, Tao, and Du, put the people first, continuously advance our thinking, distinguish between enemies and friends, unite, and work together.
    Li Jishen then spoke, explaining the responsibilities of those who survived. At a time when the whole country is about to be liberated, he pointed out that closer unity is even more important. There is an old saying: It is easy to share adversity, but difficult to share prosperity. But we must be even more united in victory than we were in the past struggles. The spirit of the martyrs who sacrificed the ego and served the people is forever worthy of admiration and learning by those who survived.
    Guo Moruo's speech excited and stirred the atmosphere of the meeting. Mr. Guo said that he was attending the memorial meeting with a joyful and inspiring mood. He pointed out that the martyrs surpassed individual death and crossed over to the eternal life of the people. At a time when the whole country is about to win, we should feel that this is a glorious day. Mr. Guo said that he shed hot tears with great sorrow in Shanghai the year before last and in Hong Kong last year. But this year, we must take an active and progressive spirit, self-sacrifice, and serve the people, and we have no sorrow. Mr. Guo went on to explain that people do have weaknesses, and sacrificing oneself is a very difficult thing. Putting on the magnifying glass of selfishness will make the originally tiny individual look bigger than the universe, and make one person look more than four hundred and seventy million. He asked everyone to learn from the example of the martyrs in the future, and to see the self as smaller, and even smaller, so as to better serve the people.
    Afterwards, the participants spoke one after another. Liu Wang Liming talked about the influence of several specific stories of Mr. Li and Tao on her. Zang Kejia recited Mr. Wen Yiduo's poem "A Word," explaining that Mr. Wen's predictions twenty years ago have now come true. After Wang @ delivered a speech on behalf of the Natural Science Association, Li Boqiu narrated the life story of Mr. Zeng Wei, and Han Zhao'e hoped to learn from Mr. Du Binheng's political morality. The memorial meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.

    民盟殉难烈士纪念日
    隆重纪念李闻诸先烈
    李维汉李济深等均往参加
    【平市讯】昨天（十五日）是中国民主同盟殉难先烈纪念日。上午九时，民盟总部临时工作委员会暨北平市支部在北京饭店六楼礼堂，联合举行纪念会。到会的除民盟盟员多人外，有林伯渠、李维汉、李济深、郭沫若、彭泽民、史良、谭平山、蔡廷锴、陈其尤、朱学范、沈雁冰、张奚若、谢邦定、齐燕铭、阎宝航，陈劭先、陈此生、李锡九、欧阳予倩、许德珩、薛愚、钱端升、翦伯赞、叶圣陶、容肇祖、宦乡、王ｊīｎ＠①、臧克家、孙起孟、柯灵、白杨等二百余人。闻一多夫人高贞、李公朴夫人张曼筠亦到会。曾伟夫人吴平已于日前抵平，因身体不适，未能到会。
    纪念会开始，向烈士行礼默哀后，由沈钧儒任主席，报告六位先烈的生平及殉难经过：李公朴是民盟中执委兼民主教育委员会副主任，在一九四六年七月十二日被匪特枪杀于昆明。闻一多是民盟中执委兼昆明市支部宣传部部长，后李公朴三天亦被匪特枪杀于昆明街头。陶行知是民盟中常委兼民主教育委员会主任委员，同年同月的二十五日早晨因脑溢血病逝于上海。杜斌丞是民盟中常委兼西北总支部主委，一九四七年十月七日被蒋介石胡宗南匪徒枪杀于西安。黄竞武是民盟中央组织委员会委员兼上海市支部委员，曾伟是民盟中央组织委员会委员，两人同在上海解放前被蒋匪特务绑架后杀害。沈氏又宣布，民盟已组织一委员会，负责办理纪念公墓，纪念馆以及筹募家属生活费及子女教养费等事情，以慰先烈，而尽后死者的责任。
    李维汉首先被邀起立讲话。他认为今天这个纪念日不止是民盟的纪念日，殉难的先烈是为了人民事业而牺牲的，一切民主党派和中国人民都要纪念他们。民盟从抗日战争以来，牺牲了的不仅是李、闻、陶、杜等六位先生，数目一定还多，他建议应该有一个详细的调查。接着他说，他对李公朴、闻一多、陶行知、杜斌丞诸先生或者与之相熟识，或者知道他们的经历，他指出他们的精神有值得大家学习的地方。首先就是他们和群众有联系的，不是跨在群众之上的。在他们心目中，第一位是群众，不是个人，不是小团体。他们是在群众中往来，随着群众一道前进的。一个人看到群众，看到人民，从人民大众出发，这个人就可能是伟大的。正如陶行知先生所说：“一个人倒下去了，成万的人站起来。”假如一个人只能看见到自己的鼻子，眼睛，那末他一定是渺小的。先烈的伟大，值得我们学习的地方，就在于一直是在人民中间生长起来的，把自己贡献给人民。他们的思想不是停止在一个地方的，不是停止在过去所受的教育上，不是停止在他的出身上，也不是停止在他过去已有的成就上，他们的思想一直是在前进着的。他们思想上的前进又是因为和人民结合在一起的缘故，因为只有群众才是历史前进的真正动力，和群众结合在一起的，把人民放在第一位，思想就一定会不断的前进。正因为这样，在政治上，在许多人还在摇摆不定的时候，他们清楚的分别出敌和友，在历史转变的关头没有迷失方向，在历史行进中成为了一个先进的战士。李维汉最后说，敌人快要全部垮台了，但还有残余力量，还有帝国主义，今后在建设上还有许多困难，我们要学习李闻陶杜几位先生的精神，把人民放在第一位，思想上要不断的前进，分清敌友，团结起来，共同努力。
    李济深继起讲话对于后死者的责任，加以说明。在今天全国快要解放的时候，他指出更加紧密的团结是更为重要的。古语有一句道：共患难易共安乐难，可是我们要在胜利的时候，比过去苦斗的时候更能团结。先烈们的牺牲小我的精神，为人民服务的精神，永远值得我们后死者的景仰和学习。
    郭沫若的讲话把会场空气兴奋激动起来了。郭先生说是以欢欣鼓舞的心情来参加纪念会的。他指出先烈们是超过了个人的死，渡到人民的永生。在全国就要胜利的时候，我们应该感到这是光荣的日子。郭先生说，前年在上海，去年在香港，他很沉痛的流出了滚热的眼泪。可是今年我们要拿积极进取的精神，自我牺牲，为人民服务，我们没有了悲痛。郭先生接着说明，人究竟是有弱点的，牺牲自我是一件很艰难的事情。套上了自私自利的超度的显微镜就会把原是渺小的个人看得比宇宙还要大，把一个人看得比四万万七千万还要多。他要求今后大家要学习先烈们的榜样，把自我看得小一点，再小一点，以便好好地为人民服务。
    接着与会者先后讲话。刘王立明讲李、陶两先生几件具体故事对她的影响。臧克家朗诵了闻一多先生的诗：“一句话”，说明闻先生二十年前的预言现在都成了事实。王＠代表自然科学会致词后，李伯球讲述曾伟先生的生平事迹，韩兆鹗希望学习杜斌丞先生的政治道德。纪念会于十一时散会。
