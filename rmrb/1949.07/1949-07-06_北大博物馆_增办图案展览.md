　　Adds Pattern Exhibition
　　[Ping City News] Since the Peking University Museum moved to its new location at No. 2 Dongchang Hutong, it has displayed handicrafts such as bronzes, textiles, porcelain, and lacquerware. To commemorate the "July 7th Incident," the museum has borrowed Miao embroidery from Tsinghua University and selected exquisite patterns from its collection of books to add a pattern exhibition for factory workers to use as a reference for improving production. Furthermore, to facilitate visits from the production sector, the museum will be open as usual on "July 7th," from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM.

  　增办图案展览
    【平市讯】北大博物馆自移入东厂胡同二号新址后，已有铜器、织造、瓷器、漆器等手工艺的陈列，顷为纪念“七七”，该馆特由清华大学借到苗民刺绣，并自该馆所藏图书中选出精致图案，增办图案展览，以供各厂工友们改良生产上的参考。又该馆为便利生产界参观，“七七”照常开放，自早八点半起至下午五点止。
