　　The World Mourns Dimitrov
　　Soviet Labor Competitions Exceed Expected Achievements
    Capitalist Economic Crisis Imminent
    The outstanding leader of the international workers' movement, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria, and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Georgi Dimitrov, passed away at 9:35 AM on July 2nd in a sanatorium in Moscow. The news has been met with mourning from working people all over the world. From the obituary issued by Stalin and the Soviet party and government leaders, to the condolences from the central committees of communist parties in various countries, the governments and leaders of various people's democratic countries, and countless progressive parties and people's organizations; from the funeral procession of the working people in Moscow, to the welcome of Dimitrov's remains by 500,000 working people in Sofia; from memorial services with portraits hung, to newspapers recording his life deeds, all are filled with mourning and respect for this comrade who dedicated his entire heroic life to the cause of the working class. Dimitrov made significant contributions to the cause of the international working class. He was loyal to Marxism-Leninism, proletarian internationalism, and the defense of the interests of his country's masses throughout his life, and dedicated himself to this cause until his death. Dimitrov has unfortunately left the working people of the world forever, but his unwavering revolutionary qualities will forever live in the hearts of the working people, and will forever be a model and example for communists and working people.
    The Soviet Union's production plan for the second quarter of this year has achieved its expected goals. Although the final figures have not been summarized, thousands of factories have exceeded their production plans. More than two thousand enterprises had already completed their five-year plan ahead of schedule last year. Now, the people of the whole country, led by the people of Moscow, are tirelessly engaged in labor competitions, full of confidence in striving to complete the five-year plan in four years.
    In the capitalist countries in another corner of the world, the situation is completely different. The United Nations Secretariat's recent publication of "Part One of the Report on World Economic Situation in 1948" fully exposes the extremely deteriorating economic situation in capitalist countries. The situation in the two largest capitalist countries, the United States and the United Kingdom, has worsened in the past week. In the United States, the most prominent event is that the production of the steel industry (the leading industry in heavy industry) is still declining sharply, which has been the twelfth consecutive week of decline. Now, the production volume of the US steel industry is only 60% of its production capacity. Compared with a week ago, it has decreased by another 23.4%, and compared with March of this year, it has decreased by 40%. In the United Kingdom, the most prominent event is the deepening of the dollar crisis (one of the main signs of the British economic crisis). According to British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps' report on British finances on the 6th, the British dollar deficit in the second quarter of this year was as high as 157 million pounds, almost doubling the figure for the first quarter, although the figure for the first quarter was already very large. All facts symbolize that the capitalist economic crisis is about to break out soon. This intensifies the contradictions and struggles between capitalist countries, especially between the United States and Britain. The US opposition to the trade agreement between Britain and Argentina, and the US-British conflict over European payment issues, are recent examples. US Treasury Secretary Snyder went to Europe on the 3rd for a "visit." The purpose of his trip is to find ways to sacrifice others to delay the arrival of the US economic crisis. One of the specific methods is to promote the devaluation of the pound. However, this plan was publicly rejected by Britain. Recently, Britain is also preparing to convene a financial conference of the British Empire. British newspapers do not conceal the purpose of this unusual meeting, which is to "seek ways and methods to resist the dollar offensive."
    Just as the Chinese people are commemorating the 12th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, solemnly declaring their opposition to the United States' delay in concluding a peace treaty with Japan, opposition to the United States' support for the revival of Japanese aggression forces, and demanding the implementation of democratization in Japan, a series of new news about the suppression of Japanese democratic forces has come from Japan. As early as April, the US occupation authorities had forced every Japanese worker to declare that he did not belong to the Communist Party or a group related to the Communist Party. On the 4th of this month, MacArthur, in his anti-communist statement, declared that "the expansion of communism raises the question of whether the communist movement should continue to be given legal status and legal protection." Yoshida's reactionary government immediately responded to MacArthur's statement suggesting that the Japanese Communist Party should be declared illegal. On the 5th, Yoshida's Democratic Liberal Party Congress issued a statement deciding to organize a "Special Anti-Communist Committee" to launch a so-called "movement to expel communism from Japan." At the same time, the Yoshida government is colluding with reactionaries from the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party to organize a fascist "Three-Party Anti-Communist Alliance." In order to find an excuse, the Japanese reactionaries fabricated a replica of the "German Reichstag Fire" incident, killing Sadano Shimoyama, the president of the government's railway company, attempting to use this as an excuse to declare a "state of emergency" in order to crack down on the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese working class's struggle against the government's massive layoffs. This developing struggle is currently being brutally suppressed by the police in various parts of Japan. MacArthur and the Yoshida government under his wing's measures and attempts, which violate the Potsdam Proclamation, seriously endanger the survival rights and democratic freedom of the Japanese people, and once again expose the extremely reactionary essence of the US policy towards Japan.
    The world's people's movement to defend peace and oppose new wars continues to surge. Under the initiative of the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions, the Soviet Writers' Union, and the Anti-Fascist Committee of Soviet Women, the Soviet Union established a preparatory committee for convening a peace conference on the 7th to prepare for convening an All-Soviet Peace Conference and further strive for peace. In the United States, Italy, and France, as the parliaments of the three countries are discussing or are about to discuss the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty, the broad masses of the people in the three countries are rising up to oppose it. Major cities in Italy held large-scale demonstrations against war and the North Atlantic Treaty on June 26th, with a total of 500,000 young men and women and millions of citizens participating. The petition movement against the North Atlantic Treaty initiated by the National People's Petition Committee of Italy has achieved great success. Petition delegations from various regions have arrived in Rome with petitions signed by millions of people, preparing to submit them to the parliament, demanding that the North Atlantic Treaty be rejected. The French people's signature campaign against the North Atlantic Treaty is also underway. Two hundred American progressive scientists, teachers, pastors, and others have recently written to the US Senate, requesting that the North Atlantic Treaty be rejected.
    The Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress has been proceeding enthusiastically in an atmosphere of unity and harmony since its opening on the 29th of last month. In the past ten days of meetings, the congress heard and discussed Saillant's general report on the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Kuznetsov's report on the World Federation of Trade Unions' struggle for peace, the rights of people's democracy, and the World Federation of Trade Unions' united struggle, as well as many other reports. In his report, Kuznetsov put forward nine tasks for the World Federation of Trade Unions and the trade unions of its member countries, suggesting strengthening the exposure of warmongers, exposing and isolating splitters of the trade union movement, and absorbing new trade union members, especially trade unions in colonies and dependencies. After three and a half days of heated discussion, representatives of trade unions from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America fully agreed with Kuznetsov's proposals. Due to the Italian government's refusal to issue entry visas, the Chinese delegation has not been able to attend the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress. However, the report of the Chinese representative Liu Ningyi on the Asian trade union movement has been read out at the congress and has won the approval of representatives from various countries.

### 全世界人民哀悼季米特洛夫　苏联劳动竞赛超过预期成就  资本主义经济危机即将爆发

　　全世界人民哀悼季米特洛夫
  　苏联劳动竞赛超过预期成就
    资本主义经济危机即将爆发
    国际工人运动的卓越领袖保加利亚部长会议主席、保共中央总书记季米特洛夫，于七月二日上午九时三十五分病逝于莫斯科疗养院，消息传来，全世界劳动人民同声哀悼。从斯大林和苏联党政领袖发布的讣闻，到各国共产党中央委员会、各人民民主国家的政府和领袖，各国无数进步党派与人民团体发出的唁电：从莫斯科劳动人民的送丧，到索非亚五十万劳动人民的迎灵；从悬挂遗像的追悼会，到记载生平事迹的报纸，都充满着对这位把自己全部英雄的生命献给工人阶级事业的战友的悼念和敬意。季米特洛夫对国际工人阶级的事业作了重大的贡献，他毕生忠于马克思——列宁主义，忠于无产阶级国际主义，忠于保卫本国人民群众的利益，并为此而鞠躬尽瘁。季米特洛夫不幸和世界劳动人民永别了，但是，他的坚贞的革命者的不朽品质，将永远活在劳动人民的心里，将永远成为共产党人和劳动人民的模范和榜样。
    苏联今年第二季生产计划已得到预期中的成就。最后数字虽未总结，但数以千计的工厂已超过生产计划。两千个以上的企业在去年就已先期完成了五年计划。现在全国人民，由莫斯科人民带头，正不倦地展开劳动竞赛，充满信心地为争取四年完成五年计划而斗争。
    在世界另一角落的资本主义各国，情形却完全两样。联合国秘书处最近发表的“关于一九四八年世界经济形势报告的第一部分”，充分暴露了资本主义国家极其恶化的经济情势，两个最大的资本主义国家——美国和英国，过去一周的情形变得更坏。在美国，最突出的事件是，钢铁工业（重工业中的领导工业）的生产仍在急剧下降，这已经是连续下降的第十二周了。现在，美国钢铁工业的生产量，仅及生产力的百分之六十。比起一周以前又减少了百分之二十三点四，比起今年三月已减少了百分之四十。在英国，最突出的事件是美元危机（英国经济危机的主要标志之一）的深刻化。据英财相克利浦斯六日报告英国财政时宣布，英国今年第二季的美元亏空，竟高达一亿五千七百万镑，比第一季的数字几乎增加一倍，虽然第一季的数字已经是很大了。所有事实象征着资本主义的经济危机很快就要爆发。这就使资本主义国家之间特别是美英之间的矛盾与斗争加剧。美国之反对英国与阿根廷签订贸易协定，美英在欧洲支付问题上的冲突，都是最近的实例。美财长斯奈德于三日已赴欧洲“访问”，他此行的目的，在于设法牺牲他人以延缓美国经济危机的到来。其具体办法之一，就是促使英镑贬值。但是，这个计划被英国公开地拒绝了。最近，英国还准备召开大英帝国的财政会议。英国报纸并不掩饰这个不平常的会议的目的，是“寻求抵抗美元攻势的途径和方法”。
    正当中国人民在纪念“七七”抗战十二周年，郑重宣告反对美国拖延对日和约，反对美国扶植日本侵略势力复活和要求实行日本民主化的时候，日本却又传来了一系列镇压日本民主势力的新消息。早在四月间，必须贺美国占领当局曾强迫每个日本工人必须声明他不属于共产党或与共产党有关的团体。本月四日，麦克阿瑟在其反共声明中，宣称“共产主义的扩展，提出了共产主义运动是否应继续予以合法地位及法律保护的问题”。对于麦克阿瑟这个暗示赞成宣布日共为非法的声明，吉田反动政府立即起而响应。五日，吉田的民主自由党大会发表声明，决定组织“反共特别委员会”，以发动所谓“驱逐共产主义出日本的运动”。吉田政府同时正在纠合民主党与社会党的反动分子，着手组织法西斯的“三党反共同盟”。为了找寻借口，日本反动派制造了“德国国会纵火案”的翻版，杀死政府铁道会社总裁下山定则，企图借此宣布“紧急状态”，以便打击日本共产党，打击日本工人阶级反对政府大批裁员的斗争，而这一发展中的斗争，目前正在日本各地遭到警察的野蛮镇压。麦克阿瑟及其卵翼下吉田政府的这些违反波茨坦公告的措施与企图，严重地危害日本人民的生存权利和民主自由，再次暴露了美国对日政策极端反动的本质。
    全世界人民保卫和平与反对新战争的运动，继续高涨。在全苏职工会中央理事会、苏联作家联盟与妇女反法西斯委员会发起下，苏联已于七日成立了召开拥护和平大会的筹备会，筹备召开全苏拥护和平大会，进一步为争取和平而斗争。在美意法三国，由于三国国会正在或即将讨论批准北大西洋公约，三国广大人民正奋起反对。意大利各大城市在六月二十六日举行了青年反战反北大西洋公约的大示威，共有五十万男女青年与数百万市民参加。意大利全国人民请愿委员会发起的反北大西洋公约请愿书签名运动，已获得巨大成功。各地人民请愿代表团已携带有千百万人民签名的请愿书到达罗马，准备提交议会，要求否决北大西洋公约。法国人民反北大西洋公约的签名运动，也在展开。美国进步科学家、教师、牧师等二百人，最近也致书美国参院，要求否决北大西洋公约。
    世界工联第二届代表大会自上月二十九日开幕以来，一直在团结与和谐的气氛中热烈进行。在过去十天的会议中，曾听取和讨论了赛扬关于世界工联活动的总报告，库兹涅佐夫关于世界工联争取和平、人民民主权利及世界工联团结斗争的报告以及其他许多报告。库兹涅佐夫在报告中提出了世界工联与工联所属各国职工会的九项任务，建议加强揭露战争贩子，揭发并孤立职工运动的分裂者，吸收新的工会团体会员，特别是殖民地与附属国的工会等。经过三天半的热烈讨论，欧、亚、非洲及拉丁美洲各国职工会代表，完全赞同库兹涅佐夫的提议。由于意大利政府的拒发入境签证，以致中国代表团始终未能出席世界工联代表大会。但中国代表刘宁一关于亚洲职工运动的报告，已在大会宣读，并博得各国代表的赞同。
