Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 1st: As the Italian Parliament is scheduled to begin discussing the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty on July 7th, the Italian people's movement against the North Atlantic Treaty is intensifying. According to TASS, on June 26th, major Italian cities—Turin, Milan, Genoa, Bologna, Cagliari, Catania, Venice, and others—held large-scale demonstrations of youth against war and against the North Atlantic Treaty. The National Executive Committee of the Italian Youth League issued a statement saying that a total of 500,000 young men and women, as well as millions of citizens, participated in the demonstrations, fully demonstrating the high level of organization and fighting spirit of Italian democratic youth. At the same time, delegations of people from various regions, carrying all kinds of people's petitions, began arriving in Rome on the 25th. The delegations will submit the petitions to the National People's Petition Committee, which will then submit them to the Parliament. The Naples People's Delegation has brought 10,000 petitions with 234,000 signatures, and another 8,000 are still being signed. The delegation from Reggio Emilia has brought 14,100 petitions with 222,000 signatures, and another 19,000 are being processed. The Ravenna delegation brought petitions with 99,000 signatures. Socialist Carbano Milioli, representing the National People's Petition Committee, paid tribute to the delegations, and pointed out that these signatures were collected in an atmosphere of violence and terror created by the government's policies, and therefore, they have even greater significance.

    【新华社北平一日电】在意大利议会将于七月七日开始讨论批准北大西洋公约的前夕，意大利人民反对北大西洋公约的运动正日趋高涨。据塔斯社报道：六月二十六日，意大利各大城市——都灵、米兰、热那亚、波仑亚、加利阿利、加他尼亚、威尼斯等地，都举行了青年反战反北大西洋公约的大示威。意大利青年联盟全国执行委员会发表公告称：共有男女青年五十万人及市民数百万人参加了示威，这充分表示出意大利民主青年高度组织性与战斗精神。与此同时，带着各式各样人民请愿书的各地人民代表团，已于二十五日起陆续到达罗马，代表团将以请愿书汇交全国人民请愿委员会，再由该委员会提交议会。那不勒斯人民代表团已带来了有二十三万四千人签名的一万件请愿书，另有八千件尚在继续进行签名中。勒佐省的代表团带来了有二十二万二千人签名的一万四千一百件请愿书，另有一万九千件正在整理中。拉温那省代表团带来了有九万九千人签名的请愿书。社会党人卡巴诺·米里奥里代表全国人民请愿委员会向各代表团致敬，他并指出：这些签名是在政府政策所制造的暴力和恐怖气氛中征集的，因此，它就有更重大的意义。
