　　Overcoming Difficulties and Achieving Many Results
  　Blind Production Phenomenon Must Be Overcome
    Summary Report by Zhu, Chief of Transportation Division, North China Highway Bureau
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China Highway Transportation and Mechanical Vehicle Conference continued yesterday (24th). Zhu Tianshun, Chief of the Transportation Division of the Bureau, reported a preliminary summary of the mechanical vehicle work of various automobile companies and factories in North China. He first stated that due to the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, various automobile companies and factories faced new difficulties on their weak existing foundations: (1) Insufficient capital turnover, with more fixed assets and fewer liquid assets. (2) The Kuomintang's massive bureaucratic structure, with few vehicles but many personnel; few workers but many managers. (3) Before the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, most factories and companies under Kuomintang rule had suspended production, with a large number of vehicles but few in use. For example, of the 269 vehicles taken over by the Tianjin Transportation Company, only 42 were operational. (4) After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, commercial vehicles from Tianjin and Beijing flooded into the old liberated areas to compete, and materials and tools were continuously imported, which affected the machinery produced in the original old liberated areas and hindered their business. However, the automobile companies and factories in North China, relying closely on the workers and adopting new working methods, overcame many difficulties, developed their business, and achieved many results. For example, Tianjin was liberated on January 14th, and the Tianjin Transportation Company resumed work on the 17th; in February, only 42 vehicles were operational, but by June this had increased to 91. According to statistics from ten companies in North China (excluding the Changzhi and Houma companies), there are already 695 various vehicles in North China. The capacity of repair factories has increased, with the ability to overhaul 144 vehicles, conduct medium repairs on 43 vehicles, and perform minor repairs on 348 vehicles within a month. After improvements, the number of machine tools has increased to 62, and the number of repair machines and instruments has reached 150.
    Due to fully leveraging the creativity of workers, continuously improving production technology, reducing costs, and paying attention to conservation, each company and factory has achieved considerable gains in production and business in the first half of the year.
    Various factories and vehicle departments have also gained considerable experience and achievements in management. The Shijiazhuang Transportation Factory adopted 47 types of new reporting forms; in terms of vehicle management, most adopted a dividend system based on the responsibility system, which achieved remarkable results. Before the Tianjin Transportation Company adopted this system, 44 vehicles were operational in February, requiring 96 repairs, an average of 2.28 repairs per vehicle; after implementing this system in June, the number of regularly operational vehicles increased to 91, and the number of repairs was only 132, an average of 1.45 repairs per vehicle.
    Finally, he pointed out the problems that need to be solved urgently: (1) Various localities have not been able to rationally allocate manpower and materials according to the new situation, resulting in blind production. For example, the Tianjin Company plans to produce "command arrows," but the Beijing warehouse has a large stock; the relationship between companies, factories, and warehouses has not yet been clearly defined. (2) Insufficient exchange of past experience, with inconsistent systems in various companies and factories, lacking unified standards, and uneven development. For example, some have implemented cost accounting, while others have not; even if cost accounting has been established, it is not consistent with each other, and these problems need to be overcome urgently.

　　克服困难取得不少成绩
  　盲目生产现象急须克服
    华北公路局运输处朱处长总结报告
    【本报讯】华北公路运输机务车务会议昨（二十四）日继续举行，该局运输处朱田顺处长报告华北各汽车公司、工厂机务车务工作的初步总结。首先他说，各汽车公司工厂在薄弱的原有基础上，因为平津的解放，带来了一些新的困难：（一）资金流转不足，固定资产多，流动资产少。（二）国民党的庞大官僚机构，车少人多；工人少、管理人多。（三）平津解放前夕，国民党统治的各工厂公司多停顿生产，车辆数量多，行用的少。如天津运输公司接管二六九辆中，能驶的只有四二部。（四）老解放区在平津解放后，平津商车涌入竞争，材料工具源源输入，致原有老解放区所生产的机具受到影响，业务受到阻碍。但华北各汽车公司工厂，紧紧依靠工人，采用了新的工作方法，克服了不少困难，业务得以开展，取得不少成绩。如天津一月十四日解放，天津运输公司于十七日就复工；二月份能驶的车辆只有四十二部，六月份发展到九十一部。根据华北十个公司（除长治、侯马两公司外）的统计，全华北各种车辆已有六九五部，修理工厂能力提高，大修能力在一个月内已能修到一四四部，中修四三部，小修三四八部。机具经过改进，工作母机已发展至六二具，修理机器、仪器共达一五○具。
    由于充分发挥工人的创造性，生产技术不断改进，减低成本，注意节约，上半年的每公司、工厂生产与业务都有不少的收获。
    各工厂、车务在管理上也都获得不少经验和成绩。石家庄交通工厂采用新式报表达四十七种；在车务管理方面，大多采用了在责任制的基础上建立的分红制，收到了显著的成绩。天津运输公司在采用此制之前，二月份能行驶的车有四四辆，要修理九六次，平均每车修二．二八次；六月份实行此制后，经常能行的车增至九一部，修理次数只有一三二次，平均每车修一．四五次。
    最后，他指出日前需待解决的问题：（一）各地还没有能根据新的形势，合理配备人力物力，盲目生产，如天津公司计划生产“指挥箭”，但北平仓库却存有很多；公司、工厂与仓库之间关系还没有明确的规定。（二）过去经验交流不够，各公司工厂制度不一，缺乏统一标准，发展不平衡。如成本核算，有的已实行，有的还没有；即便树立了成本核算，彼此间也不一致，这些都急待克服。
