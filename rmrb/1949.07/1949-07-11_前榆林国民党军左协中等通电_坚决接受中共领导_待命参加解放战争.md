　　Xinhua News Agency report: Former Yulin Kuomintang Army 22nd Army Commander Zuo Xiezong, 22nd Army Chief of Staff Zhang Zhiying, 86th Division Chief of Staff Zhang Boxue, 256th Regiment Commander Huang Zhenwei, 257th Regiment Commander Gao Lingyun, 258th Regiment Commander Dong Zhengyi, and others, who accepted the CCP's peace terms in late May and were reorganized into the People's Liberation Army, jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on June 14, expressing their firm acceptance of the leadership of the CCP Central Committee and the People's Liberation Army, awaiting orders to participate in the great war to liberate Northwest China. The telegram stated in brief: Yulin is located in a remote border area, with barren land and impoverished people. Xiezong and others have been stationed here, taking from the people for more than 30 years, making no contribution to the people, only increasing guilt and blame. At midnight, searching our hearts, we are filled with shame. Therefore, on May 19, we led our troops to accept the eight peace conditions stated in Chairman Mao's January 14 statement, and the domestic peace agreement conditions proposed by the People's Liberation Army Northwest Military Region delegation, completely severing relations with the Kuomintang reactionaries, resolutely supporting all the propositions of the Chinese Communist Party, obeying the leadership of the CCP Central Committee Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the People's Liberation Army Northwest Military Region, and, according to democratic principles, being reorganized into the People's Liberation Army in designated locations, breaking away from darkness, moving towards light, and serving the people forever. In the past, we were unfortunately misled as tools of a small number of privileged class betrayers and dictators. From now on, we vow to use revolutionary determination and resolute action to, as soon as the reorganization is completed, head to the front lines, under the unified command of the People's Liberation Army, to fight to sweep away the Kuomintang's remaining military forces, liberate Northwest China, and liberate all of China. The telegram also called on: The remaining Kuomintang troops should quickly wake up and repent, make a firm determination, seek a new life, accept Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions and the domestic peace agreement clauses, and be reorganized into the People's Liberation Army according to democratic principles. All vacillation and wait-and-see attitudes will only prolong the suffering of the people and deepen their sins. Those who continue to serve the reactionaries and stubbornly resist will only burn themselves, isolating themselves from the people.

　　前榆林国民党军左协中等通电
    坚决接受中共领导
    待命参加解放战争
    【本报讯】据新华社电：五月下旬接受中共和平条件，改编为人民解放军的前榆林国民党军二十二军军长左协中、二十二军参谋长张之英、八十六师参谋长张博学、二五六团团长黄镇威、二五七团团长高凌云、二五八团团长董正谊等，于六月十四日联名致电毛主席、朱总司令，表示坚决接受中共中央及人民解放军的领导，待命参加解放大西北的伟大战争。电文略称：榆林僻处边陲，地瘠民贫，协中等驻防于此，取用于民者三十余年，对人民毫无贡献，徒增咎责，午夜扪心，惭愧交集。乃于五月十九日率部接受毛主席一月十四日声明之八项和平条件，及人民解放军西北军区代表团所提之国内和平协定条件，与国民党反动派完全断绝关系，坚决拥护中国共产党各项主张，服从中共中央毛主席、朱总司令及人民解放军西北军区的领导，依照民主原则，在指定地点改编为人民解放军，脱离黑暗，走向光明，永为人民服务。过去不幸误为少数特权阶级卖国独裁之工具，今后誓以革命之决心，坚决之行动，一俟改编完毕，即当开赴前线，在人民解放军统一号令之下，为扫清国民党残余军事力量，解放大西北，解放全中国而战。电文并号召：残余之国民党部队，应迅速幡然悔悟，下定决心，求得新生，接受毛主席八项和平条件及国内和平协定条款，依照民主原则改编为人民解放军。一切动摇观望均将延长人民痛苦，甘自加深罪孽。凡为反动派继续效命而顽抗不悟者，尤将自取焚身，绝人自绝。
