The Beiping Public Security Bureau convened a fire prevention meeting yesterday (the 20th), gathering representatives from various public and private enterprises, institutions, labor unions, and public places. 226 representatives from 143 units attended. Bureau Chief Tan Zhengwen announced to the assembly that the Municipal Bureau will implement a strict inspection system for various public and private enterprises, institutions, organizations, public places, etc. He, Deputy Director of the Third Division of the Public Security Bureau, presented five methods for preventing fires: (1) Overcome the thought of numbness and indifference, establish the idea of combining production, anti-espionage, and fire prevention, and establish the organization and equipment for fire protection work. (2) Overcome bureaucratic work styles in leadership, establish democratic management methods, educate and unite workers, rely on the working class, and guarantee production and construction. (3) Strengthen the education of workers, cadres, and the general public in preventing special agents, preventing fires, avoiding disasters, and improving public awareness, so that it becomes a mass movement. (4) Establish a system of principal responsibility, division of labor for cadres, and on-duty systems, set up inspection groups composed of employee elections, and establish a regular inspection system. (5) Immediately organize their own fire protection organizations, carry out general fire protection tasks such as patrolling and night watch, strengthen political and technical training, improve vigilance, and prevent and control sabotage by enemy agents.

After the meeting, the First and Sixth Squads of the Fire Brigade performed firefighting techniques in front of Tiananmen Square. Upon receiving fire alarm calls, they all quickly arrived at the scene. They connected the water pipes in as little as two minutes and began spraying water. Numerous water dragons sprayed into the sky, and more than a thousand spectators responded with applause. They then demonstrated firefighting techniques such as "rope climbing" and "life-saving bag," with quick movements, also earning much applause. The "Atomic" fire extinguisher manufactured by the privately-owned Beiping New China Fire Extinguisher Factory and the foam fire extinguisher manufactured by the Oriental Industrial Cooperative were also demonstrated on-site.
