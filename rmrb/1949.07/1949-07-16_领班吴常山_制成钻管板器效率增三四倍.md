    Foreman Wu Changshan
    Develops Drill Tube Plate Device, Tripling or Quadrupling Efficiency
    Wu Changshan is a foreman at the Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory's machine shop. He observed that when drilling the boiler tube plate holes of locomotives with a "large horizontal drilling machine," it was necessary to drill through with a twist drill bit and then make it the required size one cut at a time, only making ten or so holes a day. Cutting with oxygen and then spinning would yield at most fourteen or fifteen a day. Moreover, twist drill bits were foreign-made goods, and oxygen and calcium carbide were scarce. Now, he has researched and manufactured a "drill tube plate device" to replace oxygen, twist drills, and calcium carbide: the front is a round plate with four square holes on the plate for the up-spin blades of different sizes. Each square hole's outer circumference has two screws for tightening the blades. The back is a tapered drill rod. When working, the blades are placed in the square hole suitable for the required diameter size (installing two blades), tightened with screws, and then mounted on the horizontal drilling machine. When drilling, only a small strip on the circumference of the required size is spun. The blade can spin through the tube plate in only ten or so minutes, which is three to four times faster than before. (Kai Qing, Wang Jingxian)

    领班吴常山
    制成钻管板器效率增三四倍
    吴常山是长辛店铁路机厂机械场领班，他看到“大卧钻孔机”在钻机车的锅炉管板孔时，必须用麻花钻头钻穿后，再一刀刀的做成所需要的大小，一天只能做十来个孔，用氧气切好再旋，一天顶多也不过十四、五个。且麻花钻头是外来货，氧气和电石又缺。现在他研究制成一种代替氧气、麻花钻、电石的“钻管板器”：前面是一个圆盘，盘上有分旋大小圆周的四个上旋刀的方孔，每个方孔的外周上有两个紧旋刀的螺丝，后面是带斜度的钻杆。工作时，把旋刀上在所需的直径大小适合的方孔内（上两把旋刀），用螺丝紧好，再把它上在卧钻孔机上，钻起来，只旋所需要大小适合的圆周边线上一小条，只十来分钟旋刀便能旋透这管板，较以前工作能快到三、四倍。      （凯卿、王景贤）
