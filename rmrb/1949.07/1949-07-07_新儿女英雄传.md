　　New Children's Heroes
    Episode 18: Narrow Escape (Continuation 1)
    Four
    Cui Kulu returned to the bungalow below the sentry post. Coincidentally, the shopkeeper of Fushun Store came to the backyard looking for Guo San Mazi, wanting to borrow "Baochan" to cure his blind old mother's eyes. Zhang Jinlong said glibly on the side: "This Baochan cannot be lent to just anyone! I spent five hundred silver dollars to buy it from Tianjin. It wasn't easy for anyone to get this Baochan. This was on the banks of the Ziya River, in Ziyazhen, at the Ziya Temple, under Jiang Taigong's fishing platform, where a golden light was seen, and only then was this toad found! This was the first one caught by Zhou Wenwang when he asked Jiang Ziya to fish. Now, because people are having disasters, it has come down to relieve the common people. If you worship this toad for three days and three nights with incense burning constantly, and then use the water that has nurtured the toad to wash your eyes, even a blind person of several decades can be cured. It can cure any disease! Many people have come to ask me, but I am reluctant to lend it out."
    The shopkeeper listened to him describing it so vividly, and anxiously begged even more. Guo San Mazi deliberately chimed in from the side, singing a duet with Zhang Jinlong. The shopkeeper listened, fascinated, and hurriedly took out a roll of banknotes, carefully holding the toad jar as he returned.
    The shopkeeper placed the toad in front of the ancestral altar, and the whole family burned incense and kowtowed, busying themselves for a long time. Just as he was about to cover the jar, he was afraid that the Baochan would suffocate, so he gently covered it with a small fan. Who knew that in the middle of the night, the toad jumped out, the jar also fell over, and the toad ran away. The next day, Zhang Jinlong learned of this incident and immediately led his team to surround the shopkeeper's house, demanding the Baochan.
    The shopkeeper's whole family knelt on the ground and begged. Zhang Jinlong said, "You must have taken this Baochan to sell it. If it's taken to America, it wouldn't sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars!" The shopkeeper had no choice but to ask Guo San Mazi to mediate, promising to pay five hundred silver dollars in compensation; after obtaining a guarantee, the team withdrew. The shopkeeper sold off Fushun Store to raise this sum, delivered it to the sentry post, and after saying many kind words, the matter was settled.
    Cui Kulu had just made contact with a Deputy Squad Leader Zhao under his command. That evening, just as he was about to look for Li Lannü, Zhang Jinlong arrived. He had just made a windfall from the Fushun Store shopkeeper and was in a good mood, so he pulled Cui Kulu to the backyard to drink together.
    In the middle of the drinking, Guo San Mazi thought of Li Lannü and sent a guard to fetch her to play. The guard went twice, but Lannü declined, saying she was ill and simply wouldn't come. San Mazi was very annoyed, glanced at Cui Kulu, and sneered, "Hmph, I haven't paid attention these past two days, but I knew someone had greased his soles! Damn it, who knows what tricks he's been up to behind my back!"
    Cui Kulu just drank with his head down, pretending not to hear. Zhang Jinlong looked at the two of them and said with a grinning face, "Ha, this dish today is a bit sour!" San Mazi was a little drunk, his pockmarked face red, and he slapped the table, saying, "Damn it, what sour or not! I'll add some chili peppers and mix in some Coptis chinensis, and let him see how powerful I, Guo, am!"
    Hearing this, Cui Kulu felt resentment in his heart, but he was also afraid of him. He wiped the sweat from his forehead and said with a forced smile, "Alas, these days, women have a lot of tricks, and no one can figure out what's going on!" Guo San Mazi slammed his wine glass on the table, pointed at Cui Kulu, and said, "Don't play dumb, kid! Do you think I don't know?"
    Cui Kulu couldn't help but retort, "Captain, what am I pretending? If she doesn't come, what does it have to do with me!" San Mazi saw that he, a small squad leader, was actually so stubborn, and it only added fuel to the fire. He jumped up and slapped him, cursing his ancestors for eighteen generations. Zhang Jinlong saw that he was drunk and hurriedly pushed him into the inner room.
    Cui Kulu had been subjected to a gutful of insults and was full of anger. He had also drunk too much and couldn't help but mutter angrily, "So powerful, I can't afford to offend you! Sooner or later someone will come and clean you up. Just wait, your head won't be swaggering around for many days!" Saying this, he also went back to the front yard in a fit of pique.
    Who would have thought that Cui Kulu's words were heard by Zhang Jinlong in the inner room. He pondered it and felt that there was something behind the words, so he secretly followed to the front yard and eavesdropped outside Cui Kulu's window. He heard Cui Kulu say to Squad Leader Zhao, "I can't wait any longer. Tomorrow morning, I'll discuss this matter. Damn it, I won't be able to get rid of my hatred until I've shot this bastard!" Squad Leader Zhao deliberately slapped mosquitoes with a fan, and said in a low voice, "Say less! It's not a game if someone hears you." Cui Kulu didn't say anything, but just hummed and sighed in anger. Zhang Jinlong heard someone coming out of the room and hurried away.
    In the middle of the night, Cui Kulu and Squad Leader Zhao were sleeping soundly when suddenly a few people came and tied them up, taking them to the backyard. Zhang Jinlong and Guo San Mazi first brought Squad Leader Zhao in for questioning. Squad Leader Zhao didn't admit anything. Zhang Jinlong got angry and immediately hung him up.
    Then Cui Kulu was interrogated. Cui Kulu knew that things had come to light and was so frightened that he trembled all over, his eyes bulging, and he said, "I don't know anything! I...I...was drunk, who knows what I said?" Guo San Mazi angrily pulled out his gun and said, "This bastard doesn't appreciate good food, I'll shoot you right now!" Saying this, he cocked the gun with a crash.
    Zhang Jinlong secretly winked at San Mazi, and then said to Cui Kulu kindly, "Old Cui, don't be afraid! The Eighth Route Army has a lenient policy, and we also have a lenient policy; as long as you honestly tell the truth, there won't be any problems! I have some face with the Japanese Commander and Captain He, whose death or life depends on my word! I'll give you a way out, tell me quickly!"
    Cui Kulu's chin was touching his chest, sweat was dripping on his feet, and his heart couldn't hold on. He knelt down with a thud, with snot and tears streaming down his face, and said, "Captain Zhang, Brother Zhang! As long as you spare my life, I'll tell you!" Zhang Jinlong patted his chest and said, "I guarantee you, tell me!" Cui Kulu confessed everything from beginning to end.
    Squad Leader Zhao, hanging on the beam, suddenly cried bitterly.
    Guo San Mazi pulled Zhang Jinlong aside and discussed in a low voice. He heard that Cui Kulu and Li Lannü were colluding to murder him, and he was so angry that all his pockmarks turned red. He insisted on killing Cui Kulu immediately. Cui Kulu was so anxious that his eyeballs rolled around. He crawled over and hugged San Mazi's legs, begging and crying. San Mazi kicked him hard, and stabbed him to death on the spot with a bayonet.
    Five
    It was just dawn. Guo San Mazi took some people to arrest Li Lannü. Zhang Jinlong took some people to arrest Yang Xiaomei.
    They tightly surrounded Aunt Chen's house and knocked on the door. The old lady had just gotten up. Xiaomei was sitting on the bed, breastfeeding her child.
    This time, Xiaomei came to carry out work, but she didn't establish a good foundation. She trusted people like Cui Kulu too much. She lived in Aunt Chen's house without changing locations, which was too careless. She felt that her work was going smoothly and didn't have any vigilance at all. At that time, the old lady heard the knock and said, "I'll go see who it is." She went to open the door, and a group of people rushed in.
    Xiaomei saw Zhang Jinlong through the window and was shocked. Knowing that something bad had happened, she hurriedly put down the child, pulled out her small pistol from under the pillow, jumped off the bed barefoot, and hid behind the door. Zhang Jinlong rushed in with his pistol, and Xiaomei gritted her teeth and aimed at the back of his head, but the bullet "fizzled" and didn't go off. Zhang Jinlong turned around to grab her gun, Xiaomei held on tightly, and Zhang Jinlong tried hard to snatch it. Xiaomei lowered her head and bit Zhang Jinlong's finger. Zhang Jinlong couldn't bear the pain and twisted it hard, breaking his right index finger. But several puppet soldiers rushed up and captured Xiaomei.
    Zhang Jinlong, in pain, shook his hand, furrowed his brows, and glared at Xiaomei with resentment. Suddenly, he turned around, picked up a piece of broken brick with his left hand, and knocked Xiaomei unconscious.
    At this moment, the child, Little Pang, was crying loudly on the bed. Zhang Jinlong gnashed his teeth and cursed, "I'll pick you to death, you little bastard!" He picked up Little Pang with one hand, threw him on the ground, and asked a puppet soldier for a bayonet. The puppet soldier said, "This child is so young, what does he know, let it go!"
    Aunt Chen rushed in crying, picked up Little Pang, who had already cried himself voiceless. Zhang Jinlong pointed at Aunt Chen and said, "This old thing is no good either, take them all away!" Two puppet soldiers held Xiaomei up, and together with Aunt Chen and Little Pang, they were pushed out the door.
    Xiaomei woke up and saw that the old lady had also been arrested, so she lay on the ground and refused to leave, saying, "One person is responsible for their own actions, if you don't let the old lady go, I'll die here!" Zhang Jinlong had no choice but to snatch the child and hand him over to a puppet soldier. He kicked the old woman to the ground and kicked her hard a few times before the group left.
    Xiaomei was tied with one arm, and a puppet soldier held the rope behind her, with the puppet soldiers beside her all carrying bayonets. On the way, Xiaomei saw a well by the side of the road, and an old man was drawing water by the well. Xiaomei said many good things to the puppet soldier, asking for a drink of water. The puppet soldier pushed her to the well, and Xiaomei suddenly jumped, broke free from the rope, and jumped into the well.
    The water in the well was not very deep, and she went in feet first, so she couldn't die even if she wanted to. Zhang Jinlong scolded the puppet soldiers, forcing the old man who was drawing water to go down into the well to retrieve her. The old man shed tears and went down into the well tremblingly. After a while, he came up and said, "I pulled her, but she won't come up."
    Zhang Jinlong stood by the well, holding a gun in his left hand and pointing it at Xiaomei, roaring, "You stinky bitch, are you coming up or not? If you don't come up, I'll shoot you dead right now!" Xiaomei cursed upwards from the well, "You dog traitor, go ahead and shoot! I didn't plan to live if I fell into your hands! I'd rather you kill me!" Zhang Jinlong aimed at Xiaomei and fired two shots. One shot hit her left shoulder, piercing her collarbone, and the other shot pierced her ear, staining the well water red.
    Xiaomei hardened her heart, used cold water to wash the wound, and drank water, determined to die, but she still couldn't die, and the wound stopped bleeding. Zhang Jinlong had no choice but to send two more puppet soldiers down into the well, and they finally dragged her up and took her to He Shixiong in the city.
    Later, Guo San Mazi sent people to escort Squad Leader Zhao and Li Lannü together.

　　新儿女英雄传
    第十八回　冤家路窄（续一）
    四
    崔磆碌回到岗楼下面的平房里。刚好福顺号掌柜的到后院找郭三麻子，想借“宝蟾”给他的瞎老娘治眼睛。张金龙在旁边油嘴滑舌的说：“这个宝蟾可不能随便借给人呀！这是我花了五百块现大洋，从天津卫买来了。人家得这个宝蟾可不容易哪。这是在子牙河边，子牙镇上，子牙庙里，姜太公钓鱼台底下，瞧见一片金光，才得的这个蟾！这还是周文王叫姜子牙钓鱼的时候，头一个钓上来的。现在因为人们有灾难，下来救济黎民百姓来了。把这个蟾供起来，三天三夜香火不断，再用养蟾的水洗眼，几十年的瞎子也能治好。反正什么病也能治！好些人来求我，我都舍不得借出去呢。”
    掌柜的听他说得活灵活现，更着急的央求。郭三麻子故意在一边帮着敲边鼓，和张金龙合唱了一台戏。掌柜的听得着了迷，赶忙拿出一卷钞票，小心谨慎的捧着蛤蟆罐儿回去了。
    那掌柜的把癞蛤蟆供在祖先的灵位跟前，一家人烧香磕头，忙活了半天。临时，想把罐儿盖住，又怕宝蟾闷死，就用一把小扇子轻轻儿盖起来。谁知道半夜里，那蛤蟆蹦了出来，罐儿也倒了，蛤蟆也跑了。第二天，张金龙知道了这件事，马上带队伍把那掌柜的家包围起来，非要那宝蟾不行。
    掌柜的一家老小跪在地上哀求。张金龙说：“这宝蟾一定是你弄去卖了。要弄到美国去，还不卖个百二八十万的！”掌柜的没办法，只好又托郭三麻子打圆盘，答应赔五百块现大洋；取了保，队伍才撤了。掌柜的把福顺号倒出去，凑足了这笔款子，送到岗楼上，又说了许多好话，才算完事。
    崔磆碌刚把他手下一个姓赵的副班长联络好，这天晚上，正想找李兰女去，张金龙来了。他刚从福顺号掌柜的那儿发了一笔横财，心时一时高兴，拉着崔磆碌到后院一块儿喝酒。
    喝酒中间，郭三麻子想起李兰女，就打发护兵去找她来玩。护兵去了两趟，兰女推说有病，只是不来。三麻子很着恼，射了一眼崔磆碌，冷笑的说：“哼，这两天我没顾上去，早知道有人鞋底上抹了油啦！他妈的×，不定在背后捣什么鬼呢！”
    崔磆碌只是闷着头儿喝酒，假装没听见。张金龙瞧着他两个，嘻皮笑脸的说：“哈呀，今天这个菜，可有点儿酸溜溜啊！”三麻子有些醉了，麻脸儿通红，拍着桌子说：“他妈的，什么酸不酸！我给他搁上些辣子，再搀上些黄连，叫他瞧瞧我姓郭的厉害！”
    崔磆碌听了，心里恼恨，可又怕他，擦了擦额颅上的汗，讪讪的笑着说：“唉，这年头，娘们的心眼儿多着呢，谁也摸不清是怎么个！”郭三麻子把手里的酒杯往桌上一顿，指着崔磆碌说：“你小子别装蒜！你打量我不知道啊？”
    崔磆碌忍不住顶他说：“队长，我装什么蒜？人家不来，挨我什么事儿！”三麻子见他一个小小的班长，竟然这样嘴硬，更是火上添油，跳起来就扇了他一耳光，嘴里还祖宗十八代的骂。张金龙看他喝醉了，忙推他到里间屋去。
    崔磆碌挨了他一顿窝心脚的话，憋了一肚子火，又喝多了酒，由不得气愤愤的嘟囔：“好厉害，我惹你不起！早晚有人来拾掇你。等着吧，脑袋晃不了几天啦！”说着也赌气回前院去了。
    谁想到崔磆碌这几句话，给里间屋张金龙听见了。他一琢磨，觉得话里有话，忙暗暗的跟到前院，站在崔磆碌窗外偷听。听见崔磆碌对赵班长说：“我可等不及了，明天一早，我就商量这个事儿去。他妈的，非崩了这个兔崽子，解不了我的恨！”赵班长故意用扇子噼噼啪啪打蚊子，一面小声说：“你少说两句吧！叫人听见可不是玩儿的。”崔磆碌不言语了，哼呀吓的直发气。张金龙听见屋里有人出来，急忙走了。
    半夜里，崔磆碌和赵班长正睡得香，突然来了几个人把他俩捆起来，带到后院。张金龙郭三麻子先把赵班长叫来过堂。赵班长什么也不承认。张金龙起了火，马上把他吊起来。
    又审崔磆碌。崔磆碌知道事儿发作了，吓得浑身筛糠似的发抖，两只眼睛直鼓鼓的，说：“我什么也不知道！我……我……喝醉了酒，谁知道我说了些什么呀？”郭三麻子气呼呼的掏出枪来说：“这王八羔子不吃好粮食，我立时崩了你！”说着就哗啦一声，顶上子儿。
    张金龙暗里对三麻子挤挤眼，又对崔磆碌和气的说：“老崔，你别害怕！八路军宽大政策，我们也是宽大政策；只要你老老实实说了，百屁的事儿也没有！我在日本司令、何大队长那儿，还有点面子，要谁死要谁活，就凭我一句话！我给你一条活路，你赶快说了吧！”
    崔磆碌下巴贴着胸脯儿，汗珠子砸脚面，心里撑不住劲；他扑通跪下，一行鼻涕，两行眼泪的说：“张队长，张大哥！只要你们留我一条命，我就说！”张金龙拍着胸脯说：“我保证你，你说吧！”崔磆碌就把来纵去迹，实打实的全招了。
    吊在梁上的赵班长，忽然痛哭起来。
    郭三麻子拉张金龙到一边，低声商量。他听说崔磆碌和李兰女串通一气，要谋害他的性命，气得粒粒麻子都涨红了，非立时杀了崔磆碌不行。崔磆碌急得两只眼珠子骨碌碌的乱转，爬过去抱着三麻子的腿儿哀求，又是哭，又是喊；三麻子使劲踢了他一脚，当场就用刺刀把他挑了。
    五
    天刚亮。郭三麻子带了一部分人，去抓李兰女。张金龙带了一部分人，来抓杨小梅。
    他们把陈大娘家紧紧包围了，就敲门。大娘才起来。小梅正坐在炕上，给孩子喂奶呢。
    这次小梅来开辟工作，扎根没扎好，她太相信崔磆碌这号人了；就住在陈大娘家里，也没换地点，实在太大意了。她自个儿觉得工作挺顺利，一点儿也没警惕。当时大娘听见叫门，说：“我去瞧瞧是谁。”她去一开大门，一伙人就涌了进来。
    小梅从窗眼里瞧见张金龙，吓了一跳，知道坏了事儿，急忙丢下孩子，从枕头下抽出她的小手枪，光脚跳下炕，闪在门后面。张金龙提着盒子枪冲进来，小梅咬着牙，对准他后脑瓜就打了一枪，没想到子弹“臭”了，没有过火。张金龙转身就夺她的枪，小梅死抓着不放，张金龙使劲夺，小梅低下头去一口咬着张金龙的手指头，张金龙痛不过，用力一拧，右手食指就断了。可是后面几个伪军冲上来，把小梅捉住了。
    张金龙痛得甩着手，拧着眉毛，愤恨的瞪着小梅，忽然一转身，用左手扳起一块坑沿砖，一下就把小梅打昏过去了。
    这当儿，孩子小胖在炕上哇哇的哭，张金龙咬牙切齿的骂：“挑死你这小杂种！”他一手提起小胖，摔在地上，就向身边的一个伪军要刺刀，那伪军说：“这么点儿大的孩子懂什么事，算了吧！”
    陈大娘哭着冲进来，抱起小胖，小胖早哭得没声儿了。张金龙指着陈大娘说：“这个老家伙也不是好东西，都给我带起走！”两个伪军架着小梅，连陈大娘带小胖，一块儿押出门去。
    小梅醒过来，看见大娘也给抓起了，就赖在地上不走，说：“一人作事一人当，你们不把老大娘放了，我就死在这儿！”张金龙没奈何，把孩子抢下来交给伪军，又把老婆儿一脚踢倒，狠狠的踹了几下，一伙人才走了。
    小梅给拴着一支胳膊，一个伪军在后面攒着绳头子，旁边的伪军都端着刺刀。走到半路上，小梅瞧见路旁有口井，井边一个老头儿正在提水呢。小梅跟伪军说了许多好话，要喝口水。伪军押着她到井边，小梅猛的一窜，挣脱绳头子，就跳到井里去了。
    井里的水不太深，又是脚先下去的，她想死可死不了。张金龙骂了一顿伪军，逼着打水的老头儿下井去捞。老头儿流着眼泪，哆哆嗦嗦的下井去，一会儿上来说：“拉她她不上来。”
    张金龙站在井边，左手拿枪指着小梅，吼着说：“你这个臭娘们，上来不上来？不上来我马上打死你！”小梅在井里向上骂：“你这个狗汉奸，你就开枪打吧！落到你们手里我就没想活！打死我我更乐意！”张金龙照准小梅，就打了两枪。一枪打中左肩膀，把琵琶骨打穿了，一枪打穿了个耳朵，连井水也染红了。
    小梅狠着心，用冷水泼伤口，又喝水，一心想死，可还是死不了，伤口反倒不流血啦。张金龙没办法，只好又打发两个伪军下井，好容易把她拖上来，押到城里何世雄那儿去了。
    后面郭三麻子派人把赵班长李兰女，也一块儿押送来了。
