The Jizhong Flood Control Headquarters announced that flood control has entered a tense stage, demanding that all districts, counties, and cities urgently mobilize and take the initiative in combat. The instructions are as follows: First, mobilize the masses to complete preparations swiftly, and do not wait until danger is imminent to respond hastily. Second, organize reserve forces to gain time for rescue. Third, flood control cadres should stay on the dikes to inspect and prepare at all times. Fourth, fully prepare materials, patrol during windy and rainy nights, and enforce strict rewards and punishments. Fifth, strengthen the patrol of power lines, especially after rain, to ensure timely information.

[Further News] The Jizhong Flood Control Headquarters has been established, with Luo Yuchuan concurrently serving as Director, and Meng Qingshan of the Armed Forces Department and Ding Shicun of the Water Conservancy Bureau serving as Deputy Directors. The headquarters is equipped with a radio station to contact radio stations upstream of each river.

[Further News] The Hutuo River and Zhurong River have continuously surged, with large flows descending. Five breaches have occurred on the banks of Xin'ying in Anping and Shenze sections, including a five-zhang breach in the old brick dam south of the Xin'ying bridge, a five-zhang breach in Zhangzhuang, and a one-zhang breach in Qianchenggan. Water from each breach is flooding southward. Two breaches have also occurred in the northeast embankment of Langrenxi Baoziying, one over ten zhang wide and the other five chi wide. The water is flowing toward the Changdi area. The main reasons for these breaches are that the new dikes were not compacted firmly, and the water caused severe collapse upon impact; secondly, the water flow was too rapid, and some areas were lax in defense, resulting in complacency. Upstream inquiries and downstream reports were not timely. Anping and Shenze counties have been engaged in rescue work for three days and nights and may begin closing the breaches on the 10th. The water level of the Hutuo River reached 3.15 meters on the 9th, 0.25 meters higher than the 2.9 meters of last year.

[Tianjin Electric] Due to the easing of the upstream water flow, the water levels of various rivers in Tianjin City generally decreased yesterday morning (10th). It tended to rise again at 5:00 PM. The water level of the Nan Canal was 3.94 meters, the Hai River was 3.9 meters, and the Ziya River was 4.02 meters at 5:50 AM yesterday, lower than the previous day. The situation in the evening is still unknown.

　　冀中防汛总指挥部宣布
  　防汛进入紧张阶段
    号召各区县市紧急动员主动作战
    【本报讯】冀中防汛总指挥部顷宣布防汛进入紧张阶段，要求各区县市紧急动员，主动作战，指示第一项，发动群众火速完成准备，不要等险象既成，仓惶应战。第二项，组织后备力量，争取抢险的时间。第三项，防汛干部留在堤上，时刻检查准备。第四项，充分的备料，风雨黑夜加班巡逻，严明奖惩。第五项，加紧巡护电线，尤须于雨后加紧巡修，保证情报及时。
    【又讯】冀中防汛总指挥部成立，罗玉川兼主任，武装部的孟庆山与水利局丁士存兼副主任，总部设电台与各河上游电台联络。
    【又讯】滹沱河、潴龙河连续猛涨，大流下注，安平深泽段辛营两岸决口五处，计新营桥南头旧砖坝漏洞决口五丈，张庄决口五丈，前程干决口一丈。各决口处水向南泛滥。郎仁西报子营东北埝也决口两处，一个宽十几丈，一个宽五尺。水头子向长堤一带贯注。此次决口的主要原因，乃新堤夯打不结实，水一冲，塌陷很厉害；其次为水势过猛，有的疏于防守，麻痹大意。上游电询，下游报告不及时。安平、深泽两县已抢险三昼夜，可能于十日开始堵口。滹沱河水位九日已达三·一五米，比去年二·九米高出了○·二五米。
    【天津电】津市各河水位因上游水势缓和，昨（十日）晨已普遍下降。下午五点又趋上升，南运河水位三·九四公尺，海河为三·九公尺，子牙河昨晨五点五十分为四·○二公尺，较前日下降，入晚情况尚不知。
