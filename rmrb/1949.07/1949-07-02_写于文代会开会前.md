　　Written Before the Literary Congress
　　Feng Zhi
    This congress is the first grand gathering of literary and art workers since the May Fourth Movement, that is, since the New Literature and Art Movement. Literary and art workers from the old liberated areas and those from the former Kuomintang-controlled areas, now newly liberated areas, who have been separated for quite some time, are now shaking hands tightly; workers in the fields of literature and art, who in the past mostly did not consult each other and went their own ways, can now gather together and move forward hand in hand. What a great and important significance this should have for the development of literature and art in the new China! But this gathering was impossible at any time in the past thirty years, and now it can be realized, which cannot but be said to be a result of the victory of the revolution, and also summoned by Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. Therefore, everyone participating in this conference will burst out from the bottom of their hearts with deep feelings of gratitude, expressing respect to the Chinese people's soldiers, the People's Liberation Army, and to the Chinese people's guide, Mao Zedong.
    We know that this congress will produce a new organization. Regarding the tasks of this organization, such as the elucidation of literary and artistic theories, the implementation of literary and artistic policies, the contact and assistance to workers, as well as publication, performance, exhibition...etc., many people have already expressed valuable opinions. Everyone who expresses an opinion has infinite enthusiasm for this new organization, hoping that it will become a sound and flexible organization, producing highly positive effects in its work.
    I, personally, as a participant in the conference, feel a deep sense of responsibility at this time: every word written hereafter must be responsible to the entire new society, just as every brick and tile must be responsible to the entire building. At this time, recognize a kind of seriousness: in the face of the broad masses of the people, we must wash away all the narrow habits of intellectuals. At this time, I hear a loud call, "The people's needs!" If what is needed is water, then we will regard ourselves as the tiniest drop, and throw ourselves into the water; if what is needed is fire, then we will regard ourselves as a wood chip and throw ourselves into the fire.

　　写于文代会开会前
　　冯至
    这次大会是五四以来，也就是自从新文艺运动以来，文学艺术工作者第一次的大会合。老解放区的，和过去是蒋管区现在是新解放区的文艺工作者，他们彼此隔离了一个相当久的时间，而今紧紧地握手了；文学和艺术这两个部门的工作者，过去多半是彼此不相谋，各自走着各自的道路，而今能够聚在一起，携手前进了。这对于新中国的文学艺术的发展该有多么大重要的意义！但这个会合在过去三十年内任何一个时间都是不可能的，而现在能以实现，这不能不说是革命胜利的一个成果，同时也是毛泽东的文艺思想给号召起来的。所以每个参加这次大会的人都会从内心里迸发出感谢的深情，向着中国人民的战士，解放军，向着中国人民的引导者，毛泽东，表示敬意。
    我们知道，由于这次的大会将要产生出一个新的机构。关于这机构的任务如文艺理论的阐发，文艺政策的执行，对于工作者的联系与辅助，以及出版、演出、展览……等，已经有不少的人发表过宝贵的意见。每个发表意见的人对于这新机构都抱有无限的热望，希望它成为一个健全的、灵活的组织，在工作中发生高度的积极的效果。
    我个人，一个大会的参加者，这时感到一种深切的责任感：此后写出来的每一个字都要对整个的新社会负责，有如每一块砖瓦都要对整个的建筑负责。这时认明一种严肃性：在广大的人民的面前要洗刷掉一切知识分子狭窄的习性。这时听到一个响亮的呼声，“人民的需要！”如果需要的是水，我们就把自己当作极小的一滴，投入水里；如果需要的是火，就把自己当作一片木屑，投入火里。
