    Chapter Seventeen: The Fish Escaped the Net
  　The fish that got away is the big one!
    ——Proverb
    I
    As soon as Xiaomei and Dashui got married, she became pregnant. Comrades often joked with them, saying, "Ha, Hei Lao Cai was right, you two really can accomplish the mission!"
    Xiaomei continued to work in the countryside while pregnant. By the second spring, her body was very heavy. The higher-ups assigned a major production task, and she was still very active, refusing to rest when told to. Every day she ran from village to village, held production meetings, and visited families everywhere, helping the people to make family production plans.
    One day, she came back from a meeting, feeling very tired. As soon as she entered the house, she went into labor. She was still standing when the baby presented a foot first. She hurriedly cried out. The landlady rushed to see her, exclaiming, "My goodness! Why are you still standing? Hurry up and lie down!" Xiaomei cried out, "Auntie, what can I do? A little foot is coming out first! I can't give birth!" The landlady said, "If you don't give birth, what will you do? Hurry up and lie down!" The landlady struggled for a long time before pushing the little foot back in.
    The landlady breathed a sigh of relief and said, "You, you're really crazy about your work! You didn't even realize you were so close to your due date?" Xiaomei groaned, "Production… is a big… deal… if we don't do well… we won't… defeat the Japanese devils!" The landlady said, "You've used up all your energy for us folks!"
    Soon, the child was born, a boy, red and chubby, plump and powdery. Many women, hearing the news, brought brown sugar, dates, rice, and eggs to see Xiaomei. Everyone scrambled to hold the baby, whispering, "Look, how strong he is! Big head, big ears, just like Niu Dashui, a perfect copy!" One woman said, "Look at those eyebrows and eyes, how handsome, just like his mother!" The landlady said softly, "Truly: good scallions make good stuffed buns, good parents raise good children!"
    In the evening, Dashui received the news, rode his bike, and came to Xiaomei's place. The two of them gave the child a name, Xiaopang (Little Fatty). Dashui held Xiaopang, looking at him from left to right, loving him to pieces. But he was very busy with work, and Xiaomei urged him to leave, saying that there were aunts and women here to take care of her, so he shouldn't worry. The next morning, Dashui left in a hurry.
    II
    This year, Chairman Mao issued another directive: "Expand the liberated areas, shrink the enemy-occupied areas." Our division's troops launched a spring offensive and recovered more areas.
    At the end of May, Hei Lao Cai returned from a meeting in the division and convened an enlarged conference of the county and districts, first celebrating the victory of the Soviet Union. When everyone heard that the Soviet Union had defeated German and Italian fascism, they applauded and cheered, saying, "With only Japanese fascism left, we must defeat it!" "The little Japanese are even more isolated, let's quickly resolve them!" Hei Lao Cai conveyed the decision of the higher-ups, saying that this time they must resolutely take the town, with the county and district armed forces cooperating with the main force. The comrades were so happy that they jumped up and prepared to cooperate in the battle.
    At this time, most of the Japanese devils in the town had retreated into the city, and the rest lived with a small team of puppet troops in the "headquarters" on South Main Street. There was also a puppet military police battalion, led by Battalion Commander He Shixiong, with Zhang Jinlong following him. The battalion headquarters and Guo San Mazi's First Company were stationed in the Catholic Church, with two large watchtowers in front of the Catholic Church. The Second Company, partly led by someone named Dong, lived in the Wang Family Garden watchtower in East Street; and partly led by He Goupi, lived in the watchtower on West Main Street. The Third Company was on guard duty on the city wall, with eight small watchtowers around the city wall, with small sentry posts between the watchtowers. The defenses were very tight.
    There were flood dikes outside the north and south gates, making it difficult to enter. Our division's troops planned to open the east gate, clear the watchtowers on the northeast city walls, and then deal with the enemies in Wang Family Garden and the Catholic Church. The county brigade planned to attack the "headquarters." Dashui and Gao Tun'er's district squad was to take the watchtower on West Main Street. Other district squads were to clear the enemies on the southwest city walls. Two other county brigades were also mobilized to guard against reinforcements from Baoding and the city.
    That night, Hei Lao Cai led the county brigade and several district squads of this county quietly and secretly to the designated location, Xieliu Village. Hei Lao Cai brought an old blacksmith to find Dashui and Gao Tun'er, saying, "Outside the east gate there is only one dike leading to the city gate, with water on both sides. It's difficult to maneuver on the dike, and we'll definitely get beaten up in the water, so it's best not to attack head-on. The division headquarters has given us a task to send someone into the city to open the city gate. This old man is my former master and is from the town; he knows how to pick locks. You quickly send a comrade who is alert and brave to go with him. This is a dangerous job, but the task is very important. Who do you think is suitable?" Dashui said, "Would it be alright if I went?" Gao Tun'er rushed to say, "Let me go." Hei Lao Cai smiled and said, "It's better for you two leaders not to go." Dashui suggested sending his brother, Xiaoshui, and Gao Tun'er slapped his thigh, saying, "That's it! That kid is very clever and brave, he's the right one to go!" He hurriedly called Xiaoshui over and talked to him. Xiaoshui happily said, "Alright, alright! When do we leave?"
    Hei Lao Cai said, "I'm giving you a luminous watch. Tonight at exactly twelve o'clock, you open the city gate, and the main force outside the east gate will support you with machine guns. Do you have any guarantees for this matter?" The old blacksmith was very tall, with a white stubble beard. He smiled and said, "I guarantee to open it. If I can't pick the lock, I don't want this old life!" He looked at Xiaoshui and said, "Ha! Young man, are you brave enough to go?" Xiaoshui puffed out his cheeks, tilted his head, and said, "What, are you looking down on me? I killed the Japanese platoon leader in Xieliu Village. If I can't complete the task, chop off this little head of mine!"
    Hei Lao Cai laughed when he heard this and said, "Good, good, this task is entrusted to you, one old and one young. Take the town, and you will be the first to contribute!" He took out another watch and said, "This is the commander's watch, let's synchronize them." After synchronizing the watches, Xiaoshui happily put the luminous watch in his small pocket, cocked his pistol, and happily took the master craftsman and left.
    Dashui chased out the door, stopped Xiaoshui, put one hand on his shoulder, and instructed, "Xiaoshui, you're a small person doing big things, the task is not light! You need to understand the situation, think of ways to use your brain, and help the master craftsman well; be brave, be careful, and don't make any mistakes!" Xiaoshui stood up straight, held his head high, and said with great confidence, "Brother, don't worry, I won't come back to see you if I don't complete the task!" Dashui happily patted him and said, "Good brother, when you complete the task and come back, I'll reward you!" Xiaoshui left with the master craftsman. Dashui watched them until they disappeared from sight before turning back.
    III
    The master craftsman and Niu Xiaoshui detoured to the northwest corner of the town. The water in the moat was very deep, and Xiaoshui was afraid that the old man wouldn't be able to swim across, so he wanted to help him; the master craftsman whispered, "Are you looking down on me too?" He held up his clothes with one hand and paddled with the other, swimming across lightly, and Xiaoshui followed behind.
    The two arrived at the foot of the city wall. The city wall was more than ten feet high. A gentle slope, with a @①@① every section. The master craftsman held on with his hands and stepped with his feet, climbing up layer by layer. Xiaoshui followed him up, thinking, "This old man really has some skills!" After descending the city wall, there was a large lotus leaf pit, and people rarely came here. They turned around the edge of the pit, detoured to the east, took small alleys instead of the main street, and arrived at the master craftsman's house.
    At eleven o'clock, the blacksmith asked his old wife to go to the east gate to check the situation. She returned and said that there was no movement there. The master craftsman took the iron rod for lighting the stove and found a few pieces of rag; Xiaoshui asked him, "What are you bringing these for?" The master craftsman smiled and said, "Opening the city gate depends on these things!" Then they set off.
    When they arrived at the beginning of East Street, they leaned against the wall of a small alley and peeked out. It was very dark, and they could faintly see three armed men in front of a soy sauce shop across the street, whispering and discussing something. They only heard one person say, "They must be asleep!" The two climbed over the wall and went in, and one person guarded the door.
    The master craftsman knew that the soy sauce shop owner was out, and guessed that they were either stealing things or messing with women. The two hid in the small alley, waiting anxiously? To run into the city gate, they would not be able to escape his eyes; watching the green hands of the watch quickly converging, the damn guy was still standing at the door. The master craftsman and he were very anxious. Xiaoshui was really clever, suddenly thought of a way, quietly discussed with the master craftsman, the master craftsman said okay, and quickly pointed out the way.
    Xiaoshui tiptoed around to the mouth of the small alley on the west side, hid his body, and threw a small brick at the man. The man looked around, feeling very strange. Xiaoshui threw another one, and the guy angrily asked, "Who is it?" Xiaoshui said, "The good things you're doing!" After saying that, he threw another brick and turned to run. The puppet soldier cursed, carrying his gun and chasing into the alley. The old blacksmith took this opportunity to slip into the city gate.
    Who knew that they were delayed by those three bastards, and twelve o'clock had passed! The main force outside thought the city gate could not be opened, and five machine guns fired at the city tower at the same time. The machine guns on the city tower immediately fired back. The enemies all moved, running to the east city from the city walls and streets. The old blacksmith was in a dilemma and was extremely anxious. He gritted his teeth, calmed his breath, and quickly put the iron rod on the cloth, inserted it into the big lock, and used a clever force to pry it upwards. The big iron lock clanged open!
    The old blacksmith disregarded his life and pulled open the city gate, shouting loudly, "Open, open!" The enemies discovered this, and bullets whizzed from behind, grenades were thrown down from the city, and the machine guns across the street were still roaring. The old blacksmith had to roll on the spot, rolling more than ten feet along the base of the city wall, jumping up and jumping into the river.
    The main force outside the city was very happy when they saw the city gate open. Rifles, machine guns, and many grenade launchers fired fiercely, suppressing the enemy's firepower all at once. A company commander jumped out, pointed his pistol, and shouted, "Charge!" A company of men charged into the city. Several fell, and the company commander was also wounded, he crawled up and shouted, "Comrades, charge!" In an instant, the sound of killing shook the sky, and a company rushed into the city with a whoosh.
    The troops behind also ran into the city. The enemies on the city tower fled in disorder. The main force occupied the east city, consolidated the position; while fighting on the streets, they expanded to both sides of the city wall. By dawn, the enemies in the east and north cities had been wiped out.
    IV
    The general offensive began at eight o'clock in the morning. Gunfire sounded everywhere. The Wang Family Garden watchtower was also surrounded, making it impossible for the enemies to raise their heads. They shouted and shouted for a while, and the watchtower shouted, "We surrender!" The puppet troops walked out one after another with empty hands, and the ones in the back carried bundles of guns. The captain surnamed Dong walked in the end and surrendered. They were all sent to the headquarters.
    At this time, the county brigade had already compressed the enemies in the "headquarters" into the courtyard, and the roofs of the surrounding houses were covered with people. Grenades were thrown down with a *pī*@② *lī* *pā* *lā* sound, and the smoke filled the sky, and the ground was blackened. The Japanese devils and puppet troops charged several times but couldn't get out. A group of them lay scattered in the courtyard. A small number remained hiding in the house and dared not come out.
    The county brigade shouted again from the roof, but the puppet troops inside did not say anything; they smashed the glass windows and threw out their big guns. Hei Lao Cai and his team kicked open the door and went in. The puppet troops were squatting in the corners of the wall, trembling. Lao Cai comforted them for a while before they stood up.
    But there was not a single Japanese devil among the prisoners. Everyone was very strange and searched the whole house. One soldier saw a bed made of bed boards opposite the *kang* (platform bed), so he used his bayonet to lift the felt and looked under the bed, seeing a Japanese devil, sticking his butt out and still drilling inside without moving. Pulling him out, he still tried to crawl in. Finally, he was dragged out by his leg. The Japanese devil's face was blackened by gunpowder, blinking his eyes and squatting on the side without saying a word.
    Another soldier discovered a sack standing in the corner of the wall. At first, he thought it was a bag of grain, but when he touched it, it was soft. It turned out that a Japanese devil was squatting inside, holding the mouth of the sack with his own hands, holding on tightly and not letting go. Two soldiers turned the sack upside down and poured him out.
    A puppet soldier pointed to the *kang*, and Hei Lao Cai lifted the mat on the *kang*, seeing that the *kang* had been pried open. Two Japanese devils were crawling in the *kang* hole. Pulling them out, their faces were as black as Bao Gong's, and their bodies were covered with soot and dirt, really unsightly. Lao Cai asked, "Where are your guns?" The two fools stared blankly, not saying anything no matter what he asked. Later, two Mauser pistols were found under the stove, and three rifles were found in the *kang* hole.
    V
    The enemies on the south and west city walls also surrendered. He Goupi's part of the West Main Street watchtower was very stubborn. Because the district squad had few people and no machine guns, the division headquarters told them not to attack head-on, mainly to threaten and shout.
    Dashui and Gao Tun'er were near the watchtower, and Niu Xiaoshui also came. They were 200 meters away from the watchtower, crawling behind civilian houses; first Dashui and Gao Tun'er took turns shouting: "Hey, fellow puppet soldiers! The city has been completely taken, why don't you surrender? Why are you selling your lives for the Japanese devils?" You shouted and I prompted, I shouted and you prompted, afraid to forget.
    After shouting for a long time, their big loudspeaker voices became hoarse. But the watchtower did not respond. The team members said, "No, let's hit those bastards!" A burst of gunfire passed, and the watchtower also fired back. After firing for a while, they shouted again: "We are all Chinese, don't fight! We treat prisoners well, surrender quickly!" Someone on the tower shouted: "You want guns?" They shouted back: "Yes. Surrender them quickly!" The tower shouted: "You want guns, come up and get them!" The team members got angry and shot again.
    He Goupi's voice shouted from the watchtower: "Gao Tun'er! Gao Tun'er!" Gao Tun'er responded. He Goupi shouted loudly: "Gao Tun'er, I fuck your mother!" Gao Tun'er shouted angrily: "He Goupi, I fuck your grandmother!" He Goupi cursed: "You Eighth Route Army are all raised by the Women's Federation!" The team members got angry and started cursing: "Damn it! Come down, I'll fuck your grandma!" "Damn it! Come up, I'll fuck your grandma!" "If you have the guts, come out!" "If you have the guts! You come first!" Instructor Niu Dashui said to the team members: "Let's not curse, let's shout political slogans to win them over." He led the way and shouted.
    He Goupi was still very stubborn. The division headquarters sent an explosives team, more than 30 people, carrying black explosives in flour sacks, weighing more than 500 pounds. The order brought was to have the district squad cooperate with the explosives team to dig tunnels and blow up the watchtower.
    Dashui and others hurried to find pickaxes, hoes and "ice spears" for breaking ice. Dozens of people started digging from the house. Fearing to dig diagonally; the explosives team leader looked at the direction from behind the sandbag on the roof, throwing a grenade farther and farther. The people digging the tunnel below followed the vibration of the ground, all the way through the trench, to the bottom of the watchtower. There were lights inside. Basket after basket of soil was taken out. After digging for a long time, they dug a tunnel two and a half feet square, all the way through the moat, to the bottom of the watchtower.
    They found a cabinet and carried it inside, filling it with bag after bag of explosives. The long fuse was installed, and everyone ran out to shout: "Fellow puppet soldiers, come down quickly, the explosives have been installed; if you don't come down, you will dance!" He Goupi estimated that it would not explode and shouted ostentatiously: "Dance then. See how you explode it!"
    The sun was only one tree high, and they still did not surrender. They lit the fuse and hurried out. Dashui shouted loudly with a megaphone: "Fellow puppet soldiers, come down quickly! The fuse has been lit, if you don't come down you will explode!"
    Two puppet soldiers were anxious to run down, but He Goupi forced them with a gun, saying: "Don't run! They can't explode us, the Eighth Route Army is useless, they are just playing tricks to scare people!" The puppet soldiers did not dare to run. He Goupi without a nose, droning, still triumphantly shouted towards this side: "You poor Eighth Route Army are useless, you are about to be finished, King Yama is coming to touch your noses!" Before he finished speaking, the cabinet of explosives under the building exploded with a muffled thunder, and the watchtower boomed half the sky high, broken bricks, tiles, and pieces of wood, flying everywhere; the window paper of nearby houses was all shattered.
    The district squad rushed up to grab the guns. He Goupi had already disappeared without a trace, only three or four with missing arms and legs, also fell far away, all were shocked to death. The guns were all blown up, and none could be used.
    VI
    The battles in all places went smoothly, leaving only the two big watchtowers of the Catholic Church that had not been taken. The reinforcements from the city were beaten back by us. The district squad received an order from the headquarters to temporarily withdraw outside the city to rest. Dashui told Gao Tun'er to lead the team away. He himself took the pistol team to cooperate with the main force to take the big watchtower, feeling very excited: this time, they were surrounded on all sides. How could He Shixiong and Zhang Jinlong and their gang of bad guys escape! (To be continued)

    第十七回　鱼儿漏网了
  　跑了的鱼是大的！
    ——成语
    一
    小梅和大水一结婚，就怀了孩子。同志们常跟他俩开玩笑说：“哈，可叫黑老蔡说中了，你们俩真能完成任务呀！”
    小梅怀着孩子，照常下乡工作。到第二年春天，身子就很沉了。上级又布置大生产，她还是很积极，叫她休息她也不休息。天天这村跑那村，开生产会议，还到处串门子，帮助老百姓订家庭生产计划。
    这一天，她刚开会回来，怪累得慌。一进屋，就生养啦。她还立着呢，孩子先出来一个脚丫儿。急得她忙喊叫。房东大娘奔来看她，叫着说：“我奶！怎么你还立着？还不快躺下！”小梅哭出来说：“大娘呀，这可怎么着？出来个小脚丫儿！我不生了！”大娘说：“你不生怎么着？快躺下吧！”大娘给她摆弄半天，才把小脚丫儿塞进去。
    大娘松了一口气，说：“你这个人呀，工作真干得邪！到临月了，你自个儿还不知道啊？”小梅哼哼着说：“生产……大事儿呀，……闹不好……就……打不赢鬼子啊！”大娘说：“你为咱们老百姓，心血都使尽啦！”
    一会儿，孩子生下来了，是个小子，又红又胖，肉呼呼，粉个囊儿的。好些娘儿们听说了，都带了红糖、枣儿、大米、鸡子儿来看小梅。大伙儿抢着抱孩子，悄悄说：“看，长得多结实！肥头大耳的，活象个牛大水，刚好脱了个影儿！”一个媳妇说：“瞧这眉眼儿，多俊呀，就象他娘！”房东大娘小声说：“真是：好葱包的好白子，好爹好娘养的好孩子啊！”
    晚上，大水得了信儿，骑个车子，到小梅这儿来。两个人给孩子起了个名儿，叫小胖。大水抱着小胖，左看右看，爱得不行。可是他工作很忙，小梅催他走，说这儿有婶子大娘们照顾，不用结记。第二天一早，大水就匆匆忙忙的走了。
    二
    这一年，毛主席又发出指示：“扩大解放区，缩小敌占区。”咱们分区的部队发动春季攻势，又收复了好些地区。
    五月底，黑老蔡到分区开会回来，召集县区扩大会议，首先庆祝苏联的胜利。大伙儿听说苏联把德意法西斯打垮了，都鼓掌欢呼，说：“剩下一个日本法西斯，咱们非打垮它不行！”“小日本更孤立了，赶快解决它！”黑老蔡传达上级的决定，说这一回要坚决拿下市镇，县区武装配合大部队，一块打。同志们听了，都喜得跳起来，准备配合战斗。
    这时候，镇上的鬼子大部分撤到城里去了，剩下的和一小队伪军一同住在南门大街的“司令部”里。另有一个伪军警备大队，大队长就是何世雄，张金龙跟着他；大队部和郭三麻子的第一中队，都在天主堂驻扎，天主堂前面，有两个大岗楼。第二中队，一部分姓董的带着，住在东街王家花园岗楼里；一部分何狗皮带着，住在西门大街的岗楼里。第三中队在城上守备，四周围城墙上八个小岗楼，岗楼之间还有小哨位。戒备得很严密。
    那儿北门南门外面都有浸堤水，不好进。我们分区的部队准备打开东门，扫清东北两面城墙上的岗楼，接着解决王家花园和天主堂的敌人。县大队准备打“司令部”。大水高屯儿这个区小队拿西门大街的岗楼。别的区小队分头扫清西南城墙上的敌人。还调来了另外两个县大队，警戒保定和城里敌人的增援部队。
    这天晚上，黑老蔡领着这个县的县大队和几个区小队，悄悄密密的到了指定的地点斜柳村。黑老蔡带着一个老铁匠来找大水高屯儿，说：“东门外只有一道堤通城关、两边都是水，堤上施展不开，在水里非挨揍不行，最好不硬攻。分区司令部给咱们一个任务，要咱们派人突进城里去，把东门的城门开开。这位老人家是我以前的师傅，是镇上的；开锁他有办法。你们赶快派一位同志，要机警勇敢的，跟他一块儿去。这是个危险的工作，任务可太重要，你们看谁去合适？”大水说：“我去行不行？”高屯儿抢着说：“我去吧。”黑老蔡笑着说：“你们两个带队的还是不要去。”大水提出来，叫他兄弟小水去，高屯儿一拍腿，说：“着哇！这孩子挺机灵，胆子也大，就他去合适！”忙把小水叫来，跟他谈。小水高兴的说：“行喽行喽！咱们多会儿走？”
    黑老蔡说：“给你们一个夜光表，今天晚上正十二点你们把城门开开，东门外大部队用机枪接济你们。这事儿你们有没有保证？”老铁匠是个大高个儿，胡子楂儿都白了。他笑嘻嘻的说：“我保证开开。开不了锁，我这条老命就不要了！”他瞧着小水说：“哈！这个小伙计，你敢去呀？”小水鼓起腮帮子，歪着头儿说：“怎么你瞧不起我？斜柳村的鬼子小队长还是我打死的呢。我要完成不了任务，砍我这小脑袋！”
    黑老蔡听得笑起来，说：“好好好，这个任务就交给你们一老一少吧。拿下镇子，你们就是头一功！”他又掏出另一个表来，说：“这是司令员的表，你们对一对吧。”对了表，小水兴高彩烈的把夜光表装在小兜儿里，又把盒子枪顶上子弹，兴头头的拉着老师傅就走。
    大水追出门去，叫住小水，一只手儿搭在他的肩膀上，叮咛说：“小水啊，你可是小人办大事，任务不轻啊！你掌握住情况，多用脑子想办法，好好儿帮助老师傅；胆要大，心要细，可别出了错儿！”小水站得笔直，昂着头，怪有自信的说：“哥，你放心，完不成任务我不回来见你！”大水快活的拍着他说：“好兄弟，完成任务回来，我慰劳你们！”小水跟老师傅去了。大水一直看着他们走得不见影儿，才转身回去。
    三
    老师傅和牛小水绕到镇西北角，壕里的水很深，小水怕老人家凫不过去，想帮他；老师傅小声说：“你怎么也瞧不起我呀？”他一只手举着衣裳，一只手划水，轻轻儿凫过去，小水跟在后面。
    两个人到了城墙跟前。城墙一丈多高。慢坡，一段有一个＠①＠①。老师傅手扒着，脚蹬着，一层层爬上去。小水一面跟着他爬，一面想：“这老头儿真有两手！”下了城墙，就是一大片荷叶坑，人们轻易不到这儿来。他俩转着坑边，绕到东面去，不走大街，单抄小胡同，到了老师傅的家。
    等到十一点钟，铁匠叫他的老伴儿到东门去探探情况。她回来说，那边没什么动静。老师傅拿上通火的铁条，又找了几块破布；小水问他：“带这干吗？”老师傅笑着说：“开城就指着这玩艺儿呢！”两个就出发了。
    到了东大街街头，他俩贴着小胡同的墙根，探出头去望。天很黑，隐隐糊糊的看见斜对面一家酱园的门前，有三个带枪的人，嘁嘁啐啐的不知道在商量些什么。只听见有一个人说：“准睡着了！”那俩个就翻墙进去，一个人在门口守着。
    老师傅知道酱园掌柜的出门了，估计他们不是偷东西就是搞娘们。他俩藏在小胡同里，等得好心焦啊？要跑进城门洞儿，怎么也逃不出他的眼睛；眼看着表上绿光光的长短针快并在一块儿了，那该死的家伙还站在门口不走。老师傅他俩可急坏了。小水这孩子也真机灵，猛然想了个办法，悄悄儿跟老师傅商量，老师傅说行，忙给他指了路。
    小水蹑手蹑脚的绕到西边的小胡同口，隐着身子，朝那人扔了一块小砖头。那人四面望了望，觉得很奇怪。小水又扔了一块，那家伙生气的问：“谁？”小水说：“你们干的好事！”说完，又扔了一块砖，转身就跑。伪军骂着，提着枪追进胡同。老铁匠就趁这个机会闪进城门洞了。
    谁知道给那三个坏蛋一耽误，十二点钟过了！外面的大部队以为开不了城门，五挺机枪一齐朝城楼上打。城楼上的机关枪马上也响了起来。敌人都出动了，城墙上的，街上的，都往东城上跑。老铁匠进退两难，急得要命。他咬着牙，沉住气，忙把铁条垫好布，入进大锁里，往上使巧劲儿用力一撬，大铁锁当啷一声开了！
    老铁匠不顾死活的拉开城门，大声喊：“开喽开喽！”这下敌人发现了，兜屁股枪从后面打过来，城上的手榴弹也往下面扔，对面的机关枪还一股劲吼着。老铁匠只好就地一滚，朝南沿城根鼓碌碌滚了一丈多远，蹦起来就跳到河里去了。
    城外的大部队看见城门开了，可高兴得厉害。步枪、机关枪和好些个掷弹筒打了个猛，一下就把敌人的火力压下去了。一个连长跳出来，盒子枪一指：“快上！”一连人就往城里冲。有几个倒下了，连长也挂了花，他爬起来喊：“同志们冲呀！”一时杀声震天，一个连哗地就冲进城去了。
    后面的部队也呼呼呼的往城里跑。城楼上的敌人纷纷乱逃。大部队占了东城，巩固阵地；一面往街上打，一面往城墙两边扩张。天明，把东城北城的敌人都扫清了。
    四
    上午八点钟开始总攻。四面都响开了枪声。王家花园的岗楼，也给团团围住，打得敌人抬不起头来。这边就喊话，喊了一阵，岗楼上喊：“我们缴枪！”伪军们空着手儿，一个跟着一个的走出来，后边的扛着一捆一捆的枪，姓董的队长走在最后面，也投了降，一伙人都送到司令部去了。
    这当儿，县大队已经把“司令部”的敌人压缩到院子里，四面房上都压了顶，手榴弹ｐī＠②哩啪啦的往下扔，烟土冲天，地都熏黑了。鬼子和伪军冲了几次没冲出去，院子里横七竖八的倒了一地。剩下一小部分躲在屋里不敢出来了。
    县大队在房顶上又喊话，里面的伪军也不言语；砸破玻璃窗，把大枪都扔出来了。黑老蔡一伙踹开门进去，伪军都蹲在墙角落里，哆哆嗦嗦的直发抖。老蔡安慰他们一阵，他们才站起来。
    可是俘虏里一个鬼子也没有，大家很奇怪，就满屋子搜查。一个战士见炕对面有个床板搭的铺，就用刺刀挑开毡子，往床底下一瞧，看见一个鬼子，撅着屁股，一动不动的钻在里面。拉他出来，他还往里钻。末了，揪着他的腿儿拖出来。这鬼子的脸上给火药熏黑了，巴眨着眼睛蹲在一边不说话。
    另一个战士发现墙角立着个麻袋，开头以为是一袋粮食，可是一摸，软个囊囊的，原来是个鬼子蹲在里面，用自己的手攒住麻袋口儿，死抓着不放，两个战士把麻袋颠倒过来，才把他倒出来了。
    有个伪军指指炕，黑老蔡一揭炕上的席，看见炕坯扒开了，两个鬼子钻在炕洞里，拉出来一瞧，脸都黑得跟包公似的，身上又是烟灰又是土，实在不象样了。老蔡问：“你们的枪呢？”他两个傻子似的瞪着眼儿，问什么也不说。后来，从锅台底下找出两支二把盒子，又从炕眼里搜出三支大枪来。

    南边西边城墙上的敌人，也都缴枪了。西门大街岗楼上何狗皮那一部分，可是很顽固。分区司令部因为区小队人不多，也没机枪，叫他们不要硬拿，主要威胁喊话。
    大水高屯儿他们在岗楼附近，牛小水也找来了。他们离岗楼二百米达，爬在民房后面；先是大水高屯儿两个轮流喊：“喂，伪军同胞们！现在城已经全占啦，你们还不缴枪？为什么给日本鬼子卖命呀？”你喊我提着，我喊你提着，怕忘了。
    喊了半天，两个大喇叭嗓子全成哑嗓子了。可是岗楼上应也不应。队员们说：“不行，打他兔崽子！”一阵排子枪打过去，岗楼上也往这边打。打了一阵，这边又喊：“都是中国人，别打喽！咱们优待俘虏，快缴枪吧！”楼上就有人喊：“你们不是要枪啊？”这边忙喊：“要啊。你们快缴吧！”楼上喊：“要枪你们上来拿吧！”气得队员们又打。
    岗楼上何狗皮的声音喊：“高屯儿！高屯儿！”高屯儿应了。何狗皮高声叫：“高屯儿，我操你娘！”高屯儿气得大叫：“何狗皮，我操你姥姥！”何狗皮骂：“你们八路军都是妇救会养的！”队员们急了，就对骂起来：“妈的！操你奶奶下来！”“妈的！操你奶奶上来！”“你们有种你们出来！”“你们有种！你们头里来！”指导员牛大水跟队员们说：“咱们别骂街，还是喊政治口号争取他们。”他又领头喊起来。
    何狗皮还是很顽固。分区司令部派来一个爆炸组，三十多人，用面口袋装的黑色炸药，足有五百多斤，抬得来了。带来的命令是叫区小队配合爆炸组，一块儿掏洞、炸岗楼。
    大水他们忙找来铁镐铁铣和砸冰用的“凌枪”，几十人一齐动手从房里掏起。怕掏斜了；爆炸组长在房上沙土包后面望方向，一会儿扔一颗手榴弹，越扔越远，下面挖洞的人们顺着地皮的震动，一路掏过去。里面点着灯。一筐一筐的土往外出。掏了老半天，方掏了个二尺半见方的坑道，一直通过壕沟，掏到岗楼的下面。
    他们又找了个躺柜抬进去，一口袋一口袋的炸药往里装。装了满满一躺柜。长长的药线安好了，大家就跑出来喊话：“伪军同胞们，你们赶快下来吧，炸药已经装好了；不下来你们就要跳舞啦！”何狗皮估计炸不成，耀武扬威的喊：“跳就跳吧。瞧瞧你们炸的怎么样！”
    太阳只剩下一树高了，他们还不投降。这边点着药线，忙跑出来。大水用广播筒子高声喊：“伪军同胞，你们快下来吧！火捻儿已经点着了，再不下啦就炸啦！”
    有两个伪军急得要往下跑，何狗皮用枪逼着他们说：“别跑！他们炸不着咱们，八路军有屁用，尽是耍手段，吓唬人！”伪军都不敢跑。没有鼻子的何狗皮，嗡着声音，还得意洋洋的朝这边喊：“你们这些穷八路不中用，眼看就完蛋了，阎王爷来摸你们的鼻子啦！”一句话儿没说完，楼底下那一躺柜炸药闷雷似的响了，岗楼呼的轰起半天高，破砖烂瓦木头片儿，四处乱飞；附近民房的窗纸全震破了。
    区小队哗的跑上去抢枪。何狗皮早炸得没影儿了，只有三四个缺胳膊短腿的，也摔了个远，都震死了。枪都炸坏，一支也不能用啦。
    六
    各处战斗都很顺利，只剩下天主堂的两个大岗楼还没拿下。从城里来的援兵给咱们打回去了。区小队接到司令部的命令，暂时撤到城外去休息。大水叫高屯儿领着队伍走了。他自己带着手枪组，配合大部队拿大岗楼，心里挺兴奋：这一回，四面都包围起来了。何世雄张金龙这一伙坏蛋可怎么也逃不了啦！（未完）
