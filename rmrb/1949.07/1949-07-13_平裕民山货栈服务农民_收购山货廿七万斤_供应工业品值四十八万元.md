　　Ping Yumin Mountain Goods Depot Serves Farmers
    Purchases 270,000 Catties of Mountain Products
  　Supplies 480,000 Yuan Worth of Industrial Goods
    [Reported by this newspaper] The state-owned Yumin Mountain Goods Depot has purchased over 270,000 catties of mountain products from Pingxi, Pingbei and other areas in the past three months. In June alone, it supplied industrial products produced in Beiping worth over 480,000 yuan to farmers selling goods in the city. This has not only solved the problem of farmers selling goods in Beiping and eliminated exploitation by private merchants, but has also played a significant role in supplying export trade and facilitating the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

    The Yumin Mountain Goods Depot is a joint venture between the Pingxi Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Beiping Trade Company. Its business is to purchase mountain products suitable for export, such as peach kernels and apricot kernels, produced in Pingxi, Pingbei, Chahar and other places, and to supply county promotion societies, district joint societies and farmers with daily necessities produced in Beiping, such as cotton cloth, matches and iron pots.

    The depot officially opened for business on Yangmeizhu Slanting Street in Beiping on March 28 this year, and its business has gradually expanded over the past three months. In addition to maintaining regular contact with production promotion societies and district joint societies in various counties, in order to facilitate farmers who come to the city to sell mountain products to bring back urban industrial products, a supply and marketing section was specially added on June 1 to supply cotton cloth, soap, socks, cigarettes, etc. at fair prices (lower than those of private merchants). From April to the end of June, the depot purchased a total of more than 270,000 catties of mountain products, of which peach kernels and apricot kernels accounted for 80%, and the rest were peanut kernels, dried apricots, etc. Although April is the season for mountain products to be shipped, due to the fact that the mountain goods depot's business had not officially started, most of the mountain products entering the city were purchased by private merchants. In May, the business got on track, and the areas from which goods came not only included Wanping, Laishui and Fangshan in Pingxi, but also Miyun and Changping in Pingbei. It is estimated that about half of the mountain products entering the city at that time were purchased by the depot. June is the off-season for mountain products, coupled with the busy farming season, so the amount purchased was less than in May. In addition, during this period, the difference between the price of mountain products and industrial products increased (for example, in May, 100 catties of bitter apricot kernels could be exchanged for one bolt of foreign cloth, but in mid-June, it was reduced to half a bolt). Farmers felt that it was more cost-effective to extract oil locally than to transport and sell it in Ping, which is another reason for the decrease in quantity. Mountain products will gradually mature in July. After the Tianjin Foreign Trade Company adjusted its purchase price, it is expected that business will develop in the late July.

    The depot's supply and marketing section is specifically set up for farmers who come to the city to sell goods or for promotion societies to bring goods back. It started business in early June, and the goods prepared include various kinds of cloth (colored cloth, patterned cloth, native cloth, etc.), towels, cotton thread, socks, soap, matches, cigarettes, iron pots, kerosene, salt and other thirty kinds. In June, the business did not develop much because the sales targets were limited to farmers who came to the city to sell goods to the depot. In the whole month of June, the total value of goods sold was more than 483,000 yuan, of which cloth, soap and cigarettes accounted for the majority, and the others were matches, towels, salt, kerosene, etc. Since July, the depot has expanded its business scope. Farmers who come to Beiping to sell mountain products, whether they sell the goods to private merchants or to the depot, as well as production promotion societies and village cooperatives in various counties, can purchase goods and transport them back to the countryside.

### 平裕民山货栈服务农民  收购山货廿七万斤　供应工业品值四十八万元

　　平裕民山货栈服务农民
    收购山货廿七万斤
  　供应工业品值四十八万元
    【本报讯】公营裕民山货栈，三个月来收购了平西、平北等地二十七万余斤山货，仅六月份一个月即供应了进城卖货农民价值四十八万余元的北平所生产的工业品。不仅解决了农民在北平售货的困难和免去私商的剥削，对供应出口贸易及沟通城乡物资交流均起了不少的作用。
    裕民山货栈是平西专署和北平贸易公司合营的，它的业务是收购平西以及平北、察哈尔等地所产的适合出口的桃仁、杏仁等山货，把北平市所产的日常必需品棉布、火柴、铁锅等供应给县推进社、区联社及农民。
    该栈在今年三月二十八日正式在北平杨梅竹斜街开业，三个月来业务逐渐开展，经营的范围也一再扩大。除经常和各县生产推进社、区联社保持联系外，为了便利进城售卖山货的农民带回城市工业品，在六月一日特增设一个供销科，以公道价格（低于私商售价）供给棉布、肥皂、袜子、纸烟等。该栈自四月起至六月底收购山货共二十七万余斤，其中四月份七万斤，五月份十三万斤，六月份七万一千余斤，山货的种类：桃仁、杏仁占百分之八十，其余为花生仁、杏干等。四月份虽是山货上货的季节，但是由于山货栈业务未正式展开，所以进城的山货大部由私商购去，五月份业务步入正轨，来货的区域除平西宛平、涞水、房山外，又增加平北密云、昌平等地，据估计当时进城的山货有半数左右为该栈所收购。六月份是山货青黄不接的淡月，加以农忙，所以收购的数量反较五月减少了，此外在此时期山货价格与工业品的差额加大（如五月苦杏仁百斤可换洋布一匹，六月中旬降为半匹），农民觉得运平售卖不如就地榨油合算，也是数量减少另一原因。七月山货渐次成熟，在天津对外贸易公司调整收购价格后，预料下旬业务将有开展。
    该栈供销科是专为进城卖货农民或是推进社往回带货而设立的，由六月初开始营业，所备的货品有各种布匹（色布、花条布、土布等）毛巾，棉线、袜子、肥皂、火柴、纸烟、铁锅、煤油、食盐等三十余种。六月份由于售卖对象仅限进城卖货给该栈的农民，所以业务无大开展。六月全月卖出货物总值四十八万三千余元，其中以布匹、肥皂、纸烟为大宗，其他为火柴、毛巾、食盐、煤油等。该栈自七月份把业务范围扩大，凡是到北平卖山货的农民所带的货不论是卖给私商或是该栈，以及各县生产推进社、村合作社，都可以购买货品运回农村。
