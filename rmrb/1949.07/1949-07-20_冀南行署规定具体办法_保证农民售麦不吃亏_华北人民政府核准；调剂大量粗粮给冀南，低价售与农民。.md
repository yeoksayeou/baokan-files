    Jinnan Administrative Office Stipulates Specific Measures
    To Ensure Farmers Do Not Suffer Losses When Selling Wheat
    North China People's Government Approves; Transfers Large Quantities of Coarse Grains to Jinnan, Selling Them to Farmers at Low Prices.
    [Jinnan Electric Dispatch] In order to connect urban and rural areas, develop production, ensure that farmers do not suffer losses when selling wheat, and exchange it for coarse grains or industrial products at low prices, the Jinnan Administrative Office has instructed all levels of government under its jurisdiction to call on all organizations, groups, and production departments to sell their surplus coarse grains to farmers ahead of schedule in a planned manner. In the past, although efforts were made to raise wheat prices and lower coarse grain prices, the desired results had not been achieved. In some areas, the price ratio of wheat to coarse grains was equal, and even coarse grains exceeded wheat prices. For example, in Handan City, one jin of wheat could only be exchanged for one jin of sorghum, and one jin of rice could be exchanged for one jin and four taels to one and a half jins of wheat, which was a great loss for farmers. The North China Government has now been requested to transfer a large batch of coarse grains to the area for this purpose. Specific measures are proposed as follows: (1) All surplus coarse grains from government agencies, troops, and groups should be exchanged for wheat at the price stipulated by the trade company, or lent to the trade company. Those who exchange will be treated according to the preferential treatment for cooperatives. Those who lend will be returned the same amount after the company ships coarse grains from Tianjin. If each unit has stored wheat and does not plan to sell it immediately, nor wants to exchange it for coarse grains, it can also entrust the trade company or supply and marketing cooperative to transport and sell it on its behalf, or store the wheat in the trade company, and payment can be made at a price higher than the current price at any time it is sold. (2) Measures for farmers to exchange coarse grains for fine grains: when members and organized masses exchange coarse grains for fine grains, the price of wheat should be raised above the market price, and the price of coarse grains should be lowered below the market price. If exchanging for industrial products, the price difference of the supply and marketing cooperative can be applied. Ordinary farmers who exchange coarse grains for fine grains or industrial products should also be given appropriate consideration. For those who do not exchange wheat for coarse grains, but simply buy coarse grains or sell wheat, organized masses will be treated according to the price difference of the supply and marketing cooperative, and unorganized masses also need to be given appropriate consideration. Finally, the instructions pointed out that in solving the difficulties of production and sales, we should combine farmers to establish supply and marketing cooperatives and lay the foundation for the establishment of cooperatives in general. At the same time, we must prevent price fluctuations; we must appropriately combine administrative power to maintain the price of one jin of wheat approximately equal to one and a half to two jins of sorghum.

    冀南行署规定具体办法
    保证农民售麦不吃亏
    华北人民政府核准；调剂大量粗粮给冀南，低价售与农民。
    【冀南电】为沟通城乡关系，发展生产，保证农民出售小麦不吃亏，并低价换回粗粮或工业品，冀南行署特指示所属各级政府，号召所有机关团体及生产部门，将节余粗粮有计划地提前抛售给农民。过去虽曾努力提高麦价，压低粗粮，但尚未收到应有效果，某些地区小麦与粗粮比价相等，甚至粗粮超过麦价。如邯郸市一斤麦子只换一斤红粮，一斤米则换麦一斤四两至斤半，农民吃亏很大。现已请准华北政府调剂该区大批粗粮，作为是项用途。并提出具体办法如下：（一）凡机关部队与团体节余粗粮，均应按贸易公司规定之价格换成麦子，或借给贸易公司。交换者，按照优待合作社办法。借给者，俟该公司由津运来粗粮后，照数归还。各单位如存麦子，不拟马上出售，亦不愿换粗粮时，亦可委托贸易公司或供销社代为运销，或将麦存贸易公司，何时出售，均可按照高于当时的价格付款。（二）农民以粗粮换细粮的办法：社员及有组织的群众以粗粮换细粮时，应将麦抬高于市价，粗粮压低于市价。如换工业品，可按供销社价格差额待遇。一般农民以粗粮换细粮或换工业品，亦应适当照顾。对不以麦换粗粮，而单纯买粗粮或卖麦者，有组织的群众，按供销社差额价格待遇，无组织群众，亦需加以适当照顾。最后该指示提出，在解决产销困难工作中，应结合农民建立供销社，普遍打下建立合作社的基础。同时并须预防物价波动；要适当的结合行政力量，维持一斤麦的价格约等于斤半到二斤左右红粮。
