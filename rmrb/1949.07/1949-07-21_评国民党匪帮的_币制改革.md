　　A Critique of the Kuomintang Bandit Gang's "Currency Reform"
    As the Kuomintang bandit gang's military, political, and economic situation teetered on the brink of complete collapse, and as their remaining military forces were about to be completely swept away from the Chinese mainland by the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to make a final desperate struggle, and to carry out one last act of plunder and deception against the Chinese people, have recently implemented a so-called "currency reform"! This currency reform is now called "Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates" instead of "Gold Yuan Certificates." Everyone knows that the Gold Yuan Certificates, which the Kuomintang bandit gang loudly trumpeted as "only success, no failure" on August 19th last year, went bankrupt in less than seventy days, and became worthless waste paper within nine months. The lifespan of these newly issued "Silver Dollar Certificates" will certainly be much shorter than that of the "Gold Yuan Certificates." On August 19th last year, I said, "If the Kuomintang can succeed with this kind of currency reform, then all books on economics and monetary theory in the world can be burned." This time, even children understand that if the Gold Yuan Certificates were useless, how could the Silver Dollar Certificates be any better? Therefore, it seems superfluous to criticize the Kuomintang reactionaries' Silver Dollar Certificates for their inevitable failure today, because this has become common knowledge. It's like writing a paper today to prove the failure of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, it's a waste of ink. But what I want to point out here is the deceptive and plundering nature of the Kuomintang bandit gang's issuance of Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates, to alert the people in the Chiang-controlled areas not to be fooled again.

    First, I want to point out that the main purpose of the Guangzhou Kuomintang bandit gang's issuance of "Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates" this time is to solve its financial difficulties, certainly not to facilitate financial circulation. According to Xu Kan, the Kuomintang puppet Minister of Finance himself, the Kuomintang reactionary government's "expenditure must be no less than 45 million yuan per month, while revenue is 10 to 15 million yuan, a difference of about 30 million yuan" (in silver dollars). But we know that Xu Kan's figure is an underestimation. In fact, the Kuomintang reactionary government's monthly income does not exceed 10 million yuan at most, while expenditure reaches 100 million silver dollars (according to a June 29th Guangzhou dispatch from the puppet Central News Agency). It can be seen that the monthly deficit is at least 80 to 90 million yuan. So what method is used to make up for this monthly deficit of 80 to 90 million yuan? In the past, it relied on issuing banknotes, but since the Gold Yuan Certificates were rejected by the people and became waste paper, the Gold Yuan Certificates' printing policy has failed. It must change its tricks and change the name of the currency in order to continue its printing press policy. But if only one kind of Silver Dollar Certificate is issued, then the people will never be fooled again, so it is necessary to stipulate so-called "full redemption." But if it is truly unconditional "full redemption," then if 10,000 are issued today, and 2 lots of 5,000 are redeemed tomorrow, the Kuomintang reactionaries will not get any benefit at all. Why would they bother to issue a Silver Dollar Certificate in such a "laborious" way? Wouldn't it save some printing costs to simply use silver dollars? Therefore, the Kuomintang reactionaries are playing tricks in the so-called full redemption: first, they stipulate the restriction of the place of redemption, that is, although the Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates can be exchanged for silver dollars, the place of redemption is limited to only a few cities such as Guangzhou, Chongqing, Guilin, Hengyang, Kunming, Guiyang, Chengdu, and Lanzhou. However, if there is only a restriction on the place of redemption, then the Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates cannot circulate outside these few cities, so a second clause is added, "All levels of government tax revenue and public utility charges shall accept Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates." In this way, taxes and postal, telegraph, and railway fees must be paid in Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates, while the exchange of Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates for silver dollars is limited to a few cities. Thus, the Kuomintang reactionaries can use this loophole to issue more banknotes that do not need to be redeemed (that is, use the limitation of time and space to prevent the Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates they issue from being immediately redeemed for silver dollars). But is it possible to fully redeem silver dollars unconditionally at the designated redemption points? Not necessarily. Here, the Kuomintang reactionaries drag on another tail: "When the silver dollar casting is not sufficient, the redemption of Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates may be done with gold, and the exchange rate shall be announced by the Central Bank." (Article 7 of the Issuance Regulations). In this way, the puppet Central Bank can change to redeem gold under the pretext that the silver dollars have not been cast well. Because one silver dollar exchange certificate for one silver dollar has less room for flexibility, but the listed price of silver dollars for gold can be adjusted at will, minimizing the value of the exchange certificate and infinitely increasing the gold exchange price. In fact, does the puppet Central Bank have so much gold to redeem? There certainly won't be any. This is just a facade. The puppet Central Bank can change to issue gold deposit certificates on the pretext that the gold has not been shipped, or it can raise the gold price too high, so that people are unwilling to exchange it… In short, there are many ways to make excuses for not redeeming. We can assert that the redemption of Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates for silver dollars, even if implemented, cannot continue for two months. At that time, the Silver Dollar Certificates will become a pile of waste paper, worthless!

    In short, the issuance of "Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates" by the Guangzhou Kuomintang bandit gang this time is another big scam, another big plunder. It wants to use this as a means to make up for the huge deficit finance, to greatly plunder, in order to raise their refugee fund when they flee overseas. I can assert that at the beginning of the issuance of Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates, there will be a price difference between silver dollars and Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates. In the near future, Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates will become worthless, becoming the second Gold Yuan Certificate. The Kuomintang bandit gang's so-called "full redemption" is completely deceptive. This "full redemption" magic trick will soon be exposed. The Kuomintang reactionaries are really big liars. Just imagine, when the Gold Yuan Certificates were rejected by the people in May, the Kuomintang reactionary government stipulated that 500 million Gold Yuan Certificates would be exchanged for one silver dollar. 500 million Gold Yuan Certificates combined with puppet legal currency would be 15 million trillion yuan, far exceeding the total amount of puppet legal currency issued when the puppet Gold Yuan Certificates were issued on August 19th last year (at that time, the Kuomintang government announced that the amount of legal currency issued was about 6 million trillion yuan). When the Gold Yuan Certificates were first issued, one Gold Yuan Certificate was equivalent to half a silver dollar, and the reactionary government forcibly exchanged it from the people according to this ratio; but in less than nine months, the reactionary government recovered it at a price of 500 million yuan for one silver dollar! Isn't this an unprecedented big liar! The fate of the Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates will certainly be even more tragic. Now, the reactionary government stipulates "full redemption," but in less than two months, perhaps 500 million exchange certificates will not be able to be exchanged for one silver dollar!

    Compatriots in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, never be fooled by the Kuomintang reactionaries again! Take the Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates and immediately exchange them for silver dollars. If you can't exchange them, unanimously refuse to use them. Keeping the exchange certificates in your pocket is dangerous every day. The whole country will soon be completely liberated. After liberation, the people's government will not be responsible for redeeming the Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates issued by the puppet government. In the past, the people's government set a ratio to redeem the puppet Gold Yuan Certificates, because the people's government believed that although the puppet Gold Yuan Certificates were issued by the Kuomintang reactionary government, they were the only circulating tool in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and under violence, the people had to use them. Therefore, although the people's government did not recognize the puppet Gold Yuan Certificates, in order to take care of the interests of the majority of the people, it still took on this loss itself. The nature of the puppet Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates is different from this. The people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should refuse the Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates, or after receiving them, immediately redeem them at the puppet Central Bank. If they neither refuse to use them nor redeem them, they will definitely regret it!

    The Kuomintang reactionaries' issuance of Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates this time proves to be an even bigger deception, an even bigger plunder, and an even bigger adventure (this is admitted by the puppet Minister of Finance Xu Kan himself). The failure of this adventure is inevitable, and the exposure of this scam will also be very fast. The people's government will not only not recognize the puppet Silver Dollar Exchange Certificates in the future, but also will not need to redeem them, which is what we can assert.

　　评国民党匪帮的“币制改革”
    当国民党匪帮的军事政治经济已经濒于完全崩溃，当他们的残余军事力量很快地就要被人民解放军最后从中国本土扫除出去的时候，国民党反动政府为了作最后的挣扎，为了向中国人民作最后的一次掠夺，一次欺骗，他们最近又实行所谓“币制改革”了！这次币改的名称是叫做什么“银元兑换券”而不是什么“金元券”了。谁也知道，去年“八一九”国民党匪帮所大吹大擂“只许成功不许失败”的金元券尚且不到七十天便破了产，不到九个月之内便变成一钱不值的废纸，这一回所发行的“银元券”，其寿命一定比“金元券”更短得多。当去年“八一九”时，我曾经说过一句话：“如果国民党这样的改革币制能够成功，那么世界上所有的经济学与货币理论的书都可以付之一炬了”。这一次，连小孩子也明白：金圆券济不了事，银元券还济得了事吗？所以今天我们要再来批评国民党反动派的银元券之必然失败似乎是多余的，因为这已经变成了妇孺皆知的常识。正如今天如果有人要写篇论文来证明国民党反动政权之失败，未免浪费笔墨一样。但是这里我所要指出的是这次国民党匪帮发行银元兑换券的欺骗性与其掠夺性，要唤起蒋管区民众的注意，千万不要再上当了。
    首先我要指出的是广州国民党匪帮这回发行“银元兑换券”的主要目的是解决其财政上的困难，决不是为了金融上的流通行使之方便。据国民党伪财长徐堪自己所宣布，国民党反动政府的“支出每月必不可少于四千五百万元，收入为一千至一千五百万元，相差达三千万元左右”（以银元为单位）。但我们知道徐堪这一数字是低估的，事实上，国民党反动政府的收入每月最多不会超过一千万元，而支出则达一亿银元（据伪中央社六月二十九日广州电）。由此可知每月赤字财政至少为八九千万元。那么用什么方法来弥补这每月八九千万元的赤字财政呢？在过去是依赖发行钞票，但自金元券为人民所拒用变成废纸以后，金圆券的印钞政策已失了效。它必须变一变花样，换一种货币名目，以便继续其印刷机政策。但是如果单单发行一种银元券，那么，老百姓决不会再来上当，所以一定要规定所谓“十足兑现”。但如果是真正无条件的“十足兑现”的话，今天发出一万，明天兑进两个五千，国民党反动派一点好处也得不到，他何至如此“许子之不惮烦”来发行一次银元券，干脆使用银元不是还省些印刷费吗？所以在所谓十足兑现中，国民党反动派就玩花样了：第一是规定兑换地点之限制，即银元兑换券虽可兑换银元，但兑换地点仅限于广州、重庆、桂林、衡阳、昆明、贵阳、成都、兰州等几个都市。然而如果仅有兑换地点之限制，那银元兑换券也不可能流通到这几个都市之外，于是第二又加上一条，“各级政府税收及公营事业收费，一律收受银元兑换券”。这样凡交税款及邮电铁路付费非用银元兑换券不可，而银元兑换券之兑换银元却仅限定于几个都市。于是国民党反动派就利用这个空子可以来多发几张用不到兑现的纸币（即利用时空的限制，使它所发出的银元兑换券不至立刻去兑现银元）。但是不是所有在指定兑换地点都可以无条件地十足兑成银元呢？也不见得，这里国民党反动派再拖上一条尾巴：“银元铸造未充分时，银元兑换券之兑现，得以黄金为之，其兑换率由中央银行挂牌公告。”（发行条例第七条）。这样，伪中央银行就可以借口银元未铸好而改兑黄金。因为一元银元兑换券兑换一个银元是较少伸缩余地的，而银元兑换黄金的牌价却可以高低自如，把兑换券价值尽量压低，把黄金兑价无限提高。事实上，伪中央银行有没有如许黄金来兑换呢？也决不会有的。这不过是一个幌子而已。伪中央银行可以借口黄金未运到而改发黄金存单，也可以把黄金牌价提得太高，使人们不愿去换……总之，借口不兑的方法多得很。我们可以断言，银元兑换券的兑现银元，即令实行，决不可能继续到两个月，那时银元券又变成了一堆废纸，一文不值了！
    总之，这次广州国民党匪帮的发行“银元兑换券”又是一个大骗局，又是一个大掠夺。它想借此为名来弥补庞大的赤字财政，借此来大大搜括一番，以筹措他们流亡到海外时的逃难基金。我可断言：在银元兑换券发行一开始，银元与银元兑换券便会有差价，在很快的将来，银元兑换券便会变成一钱不值，做金圆券第二。国民党匪帮的所谓“十足兑现”是完全骗人的，这一“十足兑现”的西洋镜很快就会被揭穿。国民党反动派真是一个大骗子。试想当金圆券于五月间被人民拒用时，国民党反动政府规定以每五亿金圆券换一个银元，五亿金圆券合伪法币便是一千五百万亿元，远超过了去年“八一九”发行伪金圆券时伪法币的发行总额（当时国民党政府公布法币发行额约为六百万亿元）。当金元券初发行时，金元券一元合银元五角，反动政府根据这一比价向人民强制收兑；但不到九个月，反动政府却以五亿元合银元一枚而收回了！这不是前无古人后无来者的大骗子吗！将来银元兑换券的命运一定比这还要惨，现在反动政府尽管规定“十足兑现”，但是不要到两个月，也许五亿元兑换券还兑不到一枚银元了！
    国统区的同胞们，千万不要再上国民党反动派的当了！拿了银元兑换券立刻去兑换银元，兑换不到便一致拒用，兑换券放在口袋里一天便有一天的危险。全国各地即将完全解放，解放之后，人民政权对于伪政府所发行的银元兑换券，是不需要负责兑换的。过去人民政权对于伪金圆券定一比价收兑，这是因为人民政权认为伪金圆券虽为国民党反动政府所发行，但这是国统区唯一的流通工具，在暴力之下，人民非使用不可。因此人民政权虽不承认伪金圆券，但为了照顾大多数民众的利益，还是把这损失自己挑起来了，伪银元兑换券的性质却与此不同，国统区人民应该拒绝银元兑换券，或在收下以后，立刻去伪中央银行兑现，如果既不拒用，又不兑现，一定后悔莫及！
    国民党反动派这次发行银元兑换券证明是一个更大的欺骗，更大的掠夺，也是一个更大的冒险（这是伪财长徐堪自己承认的）。这一冒险的失败是必然的，这一骗局的揭穿也是很快的。人民政权将来对伪银元兑换券不但不会承认，也不需要收兑，这是我们所可断言的。
