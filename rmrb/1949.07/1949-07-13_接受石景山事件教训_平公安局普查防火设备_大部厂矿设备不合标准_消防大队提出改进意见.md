Learning from the Lessons of the Shijingshan Incident
　　Ping Public Security Bureau Conducts a Survey of Fire Prevention Equipment
　　Most Factory and Mining Equipment Does Not Meet Standards
　　Fire Brigade Proposes Improvement Suggestions

[This newspaper's report] To earnestly learn from the lessons of the fire incident in Shijingshan and eliminate fire disasters, the Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau recently dispatched personnel to Beiping, Changxindian, Fengtai, Mentougou, Shijingshan and other places to conduct detailed inspections of fire prevention equipment in various public and private warehouses, factories, mines, hospitals, gunpowder factories, major hotels, major markets, and entertainment venues. After inspecting more than 200 units, it was found that the fire prevention equipment in most places rarely met standard requirements. A small number of departments that had suffered losses, such as the Tram Company and the Beiping Post Office, paid attention to this issue in terms of ideology and organization. The company conducted education on preventing traitors and fire, and protecting the factory among all employees, and earnestly inspected and added fire prevention equipment. However, the vast majority of units have not paid enough attention to this important issue, and some administrative leaders of the agencies still hold an irresponsible attitude, neither leading inspections nor carrying out education in a practical manner. Even if they organize a vigilance team or fire brigade, no one is specifically organized to lead them. Some mines put gunpowder and iron together, or put gunpowder in dormitories. Some companies' oil and salt warehouses store kerosene or gasoline but lack fire extinguishers. Most departments lack complete fire extinguishing equipment, and also lack inspection of existing fire fighting equipment. Some are locked in a room or placed in the dark, not placed in appropriate places. Some private kerosene merchants and oil refineries do not even have simple and economical sand and water buckets. Based on the above situation, the comrades of the Public Security Bureau and the Fire Brigade put forward specific improvement opinions and fire prevention knowledge to each unit, hoping that they would mobilize all personnel in the future to pay attention to fire prevention work ideologically, designate special personnel to be responsible for regular inspections, and strengthen the technical training of firefighters. It is best to establish various fire prevention responsibility systems in public enterprises.

[Another News Item] The Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau recently sent personnel to various places to investigate the status of fire prevention equipment, first inspecting eight match factories including Danhua and Yongli in the private enterprise sector. After inspection, it was found that Danhua had better fire prevention equipment. The factory's storage rooms and workshops were all built of whole bricks, the top was made of iron bones and iron plates, and the doors and windows were also made of iron. Fire walls were set up at the connection points of each department, and the medicine depot was completely isolated from the factory. The factory has sixteen people who are always specifically responsible for fire prevention matters, and practice once or twice a week to improve their skills. The fire fighting equipment includes a gas machine, 600 feet of 3-inch water hose, 700 feet of 2-inch water hose, 48 foam fire extinguishers, one wrist pump, and many other ladders and hooks. The factory had a fire twenty years ago, which caused heavy losses. The factory learned from the lessons, so it paid attention to fire prevention construction. The disadvantage is that although there are many fire extinguishing appliances, they are completely locked in the warehouse. In the event of something, they still need to be taken out of the warehouse, which is not as good as placing them separately in appropriate mobile positions. Other factories lack complete fire prevention equipment and should pay attention to improvements for their own safety.

　　接受石景山事件教训
  　平公安局普查防火设备
    大部厂矿设备不合标准
  　消防大队提出改进意见
    【本报讯】为了认真接受石景山失火事件的教训，消灭火灾，北平市公安局特于日前派专人分赴北平、长辛店、丰台、门头沟、石景山等处，详细检查各公营民营之仓库、工厂、矿山、医院、火药厂、各大饭店、各大市场及娱乐埸，检查消防设备情形。先后检查了二百多个单位之后，发现各处之消防设备很少合乎标准要求。少数吃过亏的部门，例如电车公司、北平邮政局等，在思想上、组织上对这个问题是注意了，该公司在全体员工中进行了防奸防火，保卫工厂的教育，切实的检查并增添了防火的设备。但是，绝大部分单位，对这一重要问题还没有引起足够的注意，有些机关的行政领导者还抱着不负责任的态度，既不领导检查，又不切实进行教育，即便组织了纠察队或消防队，也没专人组织领导。有的矿山把火药与铁放在一起，或把火药放在宿舍里。有些公司的油盐仓库内存有煤油或汽油，但缺乏灭火器。大多数部门缺乏完备的消火设备，对现有消防器具也缺乏检查。有的锁在一个房子里，或放在暗处，没有配置在适当的处所。有些私营煤油商行及制油厂，甚至连简单而又经济的沙土、水桶都没有。公安局、消防大队的同志们根据上述情况，对各单位都提出了具体的改进意见及消防常识，希望他们今后发动所有人员，在思想上注意消防工作，指定专人，负责定期检查，加强消防队员的技术训练。最好在公营企业中建立各种消防负责制。

    【又讯】北平市公安局于日前派员分赴各地调查消防设备状况，在私营企业方面，首先检查了丹华、永利等八处火柴厂。经检查后认为：消防设备较好的为丹华，该厂储藏室及工作室等均系整砖砌起，上顶为铁骨铁板，门窗也是铁的，在各部相连处，都设有防火壁，药库和本厂完全隔离。该厂有十六个人，经常专门负责消防事宜，在每周内演习一次或二次，使他们技术得到提高。消防器材配有瓦斯机一架，三英寸水龙带六○○英尺，二英寸水龙带七○○英尺，泡沫灭火机四十八个，腕力唧筒一合及其他梯子钩斧等甚多。该厂于二十年前，曾发生一次火灾，损失甚重，该厂接受了教训，因此对消防建设注意了。缺点在于虽然消火器具较多，但完全锁在库内，有了事情还须到库内取出，不如分别配置在适当的机动地位好。其他厂内消防设备多不齐全，为了他们自己的安全，应当注意改进。
