　　One Furnace Produces Over 300 Tons of Iron
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] Following the resumption of coking production in Anshan on the 13th of last month, iron smelting production has also resumed. New No. 1 blast furnace was ignited on the 27th of last month, and on the 28th, it produced the first batch of pig iron, 320 tons. This furnace is the largest iron smelting furnace that has started operation in the country, with a capacity of 400 tons. The successive resumption of coking and iron smelting has established the preconditions for the resumption of steelmaking production.

　　鞍山开始炼铁
  　一炉出铁三百余吨
    【新华社沈阳四日电】鞍山炼焦生产于上月十三日恢复后，炼铁生产亦已接着恢复。新一号鼓风炉于上月二十七日点火，二十八日即产出第一批生铁三百二十吨。该炉是全国已开工的炼铁炉中的最大的一个，其容量为四百吨。炼焦与炼铁的先后恢复，建立了炼钢生产恢复的先决条件，鞍山钢铁公司从此即可展开全面的复工工作。
