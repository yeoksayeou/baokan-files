Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 12th. Under the development and guidance of the Beiping Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Trade Corporation, and Cooperative Headquarters, trade between Beiping City and North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China is becoming increasingly prosperous. At the beginning of the liberation, the Trade Corporation transported grain to Beiping, and by the end of June, the company had transported more than 120 million catties of grain to Beiping from various regions. In May, the company sent personnel and private business representatives to form an investigation team to the Northeast to investigate grain sources and promote Beiping industrial products, so that trade between Beiping and the Northeast was unimpeded. As of June 18, more than 400 private merchants had gone to the Northeast to purchase grain and sell goods. The Pingjin Coal and Iron Company, affiliated with the Trade Corporation, recently purchased 500 tons of iron from Anshan to supply the needs of Pingjin industry, and will continue to purchase and transport it in the future. In May, the Beiping City Cooperative Headquarters established grain and goods warehouses one after another, and set up a warehouse department in the Farmers' Hostel to handle purchasing on behalf of customers and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. At present, each warehouse has successively established trade relations with the industry departments and cooperatives of Shandong, Chahar, Suiyuan, Jizhong, Jinnan, Jidong, Jilin and other provinces and regions. By the end of June, the amount of rice and grain supplied to Beiping by the above-mentioned areas reached 2 million catties, more than 17,000 bags of flour, and a large amount of mountain products, medicinal materials, raw silk, bristles, eggs, and fur were also transported. The goods transported from Beiping to various places are mostly knitwear, cloth, fertilizers and other industrial products necessary for farmers. In June, the Beiping Industrial Exhibition also played a significant role in the development of trade between Beiping and other regions. During the exhibition, the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beiping Municipal People's Government invited delegations from various places to Beiping to hold symposiums to discuss trade, cooperatives and other issues. At the meeting, the Trade Corporation also established further direct trade relations with various regions. In order to strengthen the leadership of this increasingly frequent trade work, the municipal government specially established a trade guidance office in June. Recently, the office has formed two material exchange groups with the Trade Corporation and the Cooperative Headquarters to go to the Northeast and Northwest to negotiate material exchange matters.

    【新华社北平十二日电】在平市工商局、贸易公司和合作总社的开拓和指导下，北平市与华北、东北、西北各地的贸易日益畅旺。解放之初贸易公司即源源运输粮食来平，至六月底该公司自各地运供平市的粮食共达一亿二千余万斤。五月，该公司曾派员与私商代表合组调查组赴东北调查粮源和推销平市工业品，使平市与东北的贸易畅通。截至六月十八日，私商赴东北购粮与销货者已达四百余家。贸易公司所属的平津煤铁公司最近亦自鞍山购回铁五百吨供应平津工业需要，今后将源源购运。平市合作总社则于五月间先后建立了粮货栈，并在农民招待所内附设了栈务部，来办理代购业务，促进城乡物资的交流。现各栈已先后与山东、察哈尔、绥远、冀中、冀南、冀东、吉林等省、区的实业厅和合作社，建立了贸易关系。至六月底，由上述各地供平市的米粮达二百万斤、面粉一万七千余袋，运到的山货、药材、生丝、猪鬃、鸡蛋、毛皮等也很多。由平市运供各地的多为针织品、纱布、肥料等为农民必需的工业品。六月间，平市工业展览会对平市与各地贸易的发展也有很大的作用。在展览期间，中共北平市委会和北平市人民政府，曾邀请各地来平参观的代表团举行讨论贸易、合作社等问题的座谈会，会上，贸易公司又与各地建立了进一步的直接贸易关系。为加强领导这一日益频繁的贸易工作，平市政府特于六月增设贸易指导处。最近，该处已与贸易公司、合作总社合组了两个物资交流小组，分赴东北、西北商洽物资交流事宜。
