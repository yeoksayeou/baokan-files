　　【Jizhong Electric】Yangliuqing Organizes Coal Industry Supply and Marketing Cooperative
  　Low-Priced Coal Sales Satisfy Members
    [Jizhong Electric] Yangliuqing has organized a coal industry supply and marketing cooperative to solve the problem of firewood shortages for citizens. Before the liberation of Yangliuqing, the people suffered greatly from firewood shortages due to the looting and burning by the Kuomintang. According to a survey by the People's Government, the city needs 100 tons of bituminous coal and 200 tons of coal chunks for making briquettes each month. To solve this difficulty, the government established a coal industry supply and marketing cooperative on May 17th, absorbing members based on the principle of equal shares and equal benefits. The burning coal is supplied by Tianjin Coal and Iron Company. By the end of June, 125.5 tons of bituminous coal and 96 tons of lump coal had been transported. To make it convenient for members to buy coal, nine branches were established in various streets throughout the city, with a total of 1,983 members. When selling, the coal chunks are made into coal briquettes and supplied to members at a price lower than the market price. For example, when the first batch of coal arrived, the market price of coal briquettes was 4 yuan per catty, while the supply and marketing cooperative supplied them to members at 3 yuan per catty. Currently, 89.5 tons of bituminous coal and 85 tons of lump coal have been sold. The profits earned by the supply and marketing cooperative are used as the public accumulation fund of the cooperative, which makes the members very satisfied. The cooperative has also stipulated various business systems and decided to hold a member meeting once a month in each branch unit to report on the accounts and business execution, and solicit members' opinions to improve the work in a timely manner.

　　杨柳青组织煤业供销社
  　低价售煤社员满意
    【冀中电】杨柳青组织煤业供销社，解决市民烧柴困难。杨柳青解放前，由于国民党的抢掠焚烧，所以群众的烧柴极感困难。据人民政府调查，全市每月需烟煤一百吨，打煤球的煤块二百吨。政府为解决这一困难，于五月十七日组成煤业供销合作社，以平均入股平均受惠的原则吸收社员。烧煤由天津煤铁公司供给，至六月底运到烟煤一百二十五吨半，块煤九十六吨。为了社员买煤便利，并在全市各街设立了九个分社，共社员一千九百八十三人。出售时，将煤块打成煤球后，低于市价供给社员，如第一批煤运来时，煤球市价四元一斤，供销社则以每斤三元供给社员，现已售出烟煤八十九吨半，煤块八十五吨。供销社所得盈利均作为社的公积金，社员均感满意。该社并规定各种业务制度，决定一个月以分社为单位开社员大会一次，报告帐目及业务执行的情形，征求社员意见，及时改进工作。
