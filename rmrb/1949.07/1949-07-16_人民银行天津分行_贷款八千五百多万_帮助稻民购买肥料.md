    People's Bank of China Tianjin Branch
    Loans Over 85 Million
    To Help Rice Farmers Purchase Fertilizer
    [This newspaper Tianjin news] In order to support rice paddy production in the new Tianjin County area, the Cooperation Department of the People's Bank of China Tianjin Branch has successively provided fertilizer loans totaling over 85 million yuan. The first, second, third, and fourth districts, and the three towns of Xiaozhan, Jian Shuigu, and Gegu, which are famous for rice production in Tianjin County, have a total of 120,000 mu of rice paddies, with more than 920 power machines, totaling over 3,800 horsepower. The average yield per mu is about 600 jin, with a total annual output of over 72 million jin. After the liberation of Tianjin, farmers who had long been exploited by landlords' usury, although they had received land, still lacked capital to manage the land. In May, the Cooperation Department of the People's Bank of China, through the Tianjin County Promotion Agency, provided farmers with loans of 35 million yuan to purchase over 2.8 million jin of soybean cakes, solving the basic fertilizer problem for over 18,700 mu; on the 10th of this month, an additional loan of over 50 million yuan was provided to purchase 2 million jin of soybean cakes and 100 tons of fertilizer powder, solving the topdressing problem. The two loans solved the fertilizer difficulties of 5,200 farming households. The rice seedlings have been fertilized in a timely manner and are developing well. It is estimated that this autumn harvest can increase production by over 19 million jin.

    人民银行天津分行
    贷款八千五百多万
    帮助稻民购买肥料
    【本报天津讯】人民银行天津分行合作部为扶植新区天津县一带稻田生产，先后举办肥料贷款八千五百余万元。天津县产稻著名地区第一、二、三、四区及小站、硷水沽、葛沽三个市镇，共有稻田十二万亩，动力机九百二十余台，合计三千八百余匹马力，每亩平均产量约六百斤，全年总产量达七千二百余万斤。天津解放后，受地主高利贷长期剥削的农民，虽然分得土地，仍缺乏经营土地的资本。五月份人民银行合作部通过天津县推进社给农民贷款三千五百万元，购豆饼二百八十余万斤，解决了一万八千七百余亩的基本肥问题；本月十日增贷五千余万元，购豆饼二百万斤，肥田粉一百吨，解决追肥的问题。两次贷款解决了五千二百户农民的肥料困难。稻秧得到及时施肥，正在很好发育。预计今年秋收可增产一千九百余万斤。
