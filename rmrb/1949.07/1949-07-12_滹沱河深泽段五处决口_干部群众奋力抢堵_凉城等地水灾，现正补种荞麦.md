[Ji Zhong Telegram] Five breaches occurred in the Hutuo River's Shenze section, including Nan Nian, on the 9th. Upon hearing the news, the Ninth Prefectural Committee immediately convened an emergency meeting and dispatched more than ten capable cadres to organize the masses to close the breaches. Currently, the main cadres along the river have been assigned fixed sections to take responsibility for flood control leadership. The rescue teams are already working on the dikes, and watch posts have been set up along each section. In addition, flood control headquarters have been established in each river area, and telephone lines have been connected to the Ji Zhong Flood Control Headquarters to report the situation at any time.

[Suiyuan Telegram] Liangcheng and other areas in eastern Suiyuan have recently suffered from flooding. County and district cadres have gone to the disaster areas to organize the masses to replant buckwheat. Tian Xin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture Department of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, and other comrades have personally gone to the disaster areas to lead the replanting efforts. The disaster-stricken masses have received 100 shi of buckwheat seeds provided by the People's Government. The flooding has raised a high level of vigilance in all counties, and they are mobilizing the masses to build dikes, repair dams, and dredge canals.

[Tianjin Telegram] The water level of various rivers in Tianjin gradually stabilized yesterday (the 11th), slightly lower than the previous day. The Tianjin Flood Control Committee held a general inspection preparation meeting for flood control projects yesterday to discuss the flood control inspection work, which is scheduled to begin on the 12th and be completed within a week.

[Further News] The Tianjin Flood Control Committee recently called on all citizens to automatically protect the dikes and embankments. Anyone who discovers damage to the dikes and embankments should promptly report it to the committee.
