　　A Few Words
  　Immediately Inspect Dangerous Embankment Sections!
    The flood season has arrived, and flood prevention has become an urgent task. The continuous rainy days should further arouse our vigilance! The dangers at Xiache of the Guantai section of the Yellow River, and near Machang Village along the Yongding River's banks, are serious warning signs! All regions must earnestly inspect embankment projects, repair any deficiencies, prepare materials, and implement strict precautions. Historically, spring droughts and autumn floods have been almost a regular occurrence. We must take precautions before trouble arises. The North China Water Conservancy Commission has sent specialists to the Yongding River section to inspect the project and discovered many problems. All relevant areas should follow suit, immediately dispatching specialists to patrol dangerous embankment sections, carefully inspecting every hole and crack, ordering repairs to prevent future troubles. With the recent heavy rains and rising rivers, leading agencies in relevant areas must monitor the flood situation at all times, prepare forces, resolutely combat all complacency, and fight the potentially approaching floods as if in battle, protecting the people's lives and property, and safeguarding the autumn harvest production that is vital to the survival of the entire region's people!

　　三言两语
  　立即检查堤防险工！
    伏汛到了，防汛已成紧迫任务，连日阴雨，更应引起我们警惕！黄河贯台的下蛰，永定河马厂村附近堤岸的出险，都是严重的警号！各地要切实检查堤工，补修缺残，准备工料，严密防范。历年来春旱秋涝几成规律，必须防患于未然，华北水利委员会派专人到永定河段检查工程，发现了很多问题，各有关地区均应效法，即派专人巡视堤防险工，一穴一缝都要认真检查，饬令修补，以免遗患。近日雨多河涨，有关地区领导机关更须随时掌握汛情，准备力量，坚决同一切麻痹现象作斗争，象作战一样地同可能袭来的洪水搏斗，保卫人民的生命财产，保卫全区人民生死攸关的秋季生产！
