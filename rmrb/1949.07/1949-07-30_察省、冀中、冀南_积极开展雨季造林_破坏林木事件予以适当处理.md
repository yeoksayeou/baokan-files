[Comprehensive news from this newspaper] After the North China People's Government issued instructions on rainy season afforestation, Pingxi Special District in Chahar Province, various places in Central Hebei, and Ningnan in Southern Hebei have begun to carry out this work with leadership. Pingxi began planting trees in the rainy season at the beginning of July. After entering the fu (a traditional Chinese period of intense heat, usually referring to the dog days), each county organized work groups to lead the masses in a comprehensive afforestation campaign, combined with weeding, fertilizer application, and flood prevention. Before the fu period, Laishui repaired more than 47,000 jujube trees and planted trees on more than 1,200 mu of wasteland. Many villages exceeded their plans. Nancheng Temple in the Sixth District organized more than 260 people to plant more than 30,000 trees, more than one and a half times the original plan. In five districts and thirty-eight villages in Fangshan, a total of 68,500 fruit trees and willows have been planted, and 15.5 mu of nurseries have been planted. To combine with flood control, villages along the Xiaoging River in Liangxiang planted 64,600 willows on the dikes. Masses in villages along the Yongding River, Juma River, Daqing River, and Xiaoging River in Zhuo, Liang, and Wan are also planting a large number of flood control and windbreak forests on dikes and beaches. In the eight special districts of Central Hebei, more than 131,000 trees were planted on river embankments this spring, which is still more than 70,000 trees short of the annual plan. The special office specially notified all counties in the middle of this month to seize the rainy season and continue to complete the plan, and to replenish the trees that did not survive in the spring. Shijiazhuang, Sixth District, Shulu, has 1,600 mu of land with gullies, and trees have been planted on half of it. In the middle of the month, the Yishui Prefectural Committee issued instructions calling on all cadres and personnel of agencies, troops, organizations, schools, factories, and state-owned stores in the entire special area to ensure that each person plants and keeps alive one tree during the rainy season. This work has now been widely carried out throughout the special area. The special office also held a forestry meeting to check the preparations made in the previous stage. Generally, all counties have paid attention to this. For example, Yong'anzhuang and other ten villages in Mancheng have prepared 1,000 to 2,000 black jujube seedlings each, and launched a campaign to collect apricot kernels and locust seeds for sowing on barren mountains. According to statistics from Wan, Tang, Wang, Man, Lai, Yi and other six counties, nine districts and sixty-six villages have planted more than 70,000 trees and sowed 5,600 nests and ten mu of barren mountains. In the practical work of the Third District of Wan County, branch party members are the core leadership. Nanchangfeng Village alone planted 1,000 willow nests. In order to dispel the masses' concerns, each county has conducted inspections of forest protection work, appropriately handled unresolved incidents of damaging trees, and issued forest certificates to the masses with emphasis, which improved the masses' enthusiasm. The main shortcomings in the initial stage of the rainy season afforestation work in this special area are that the leadership overemphasized the masses' lack of habits and failed to more widely mobilize the masses to create a movement. Individual districts and villages still have a simple task perspective, only seeking leadership convenience, and calling on the militia to plant collectively, which violates the principle of "whoever plants owns" and fails to determine forest rights according to labor. These shortcomings are being corrected. (Central Hebei Branch, Pingxi Prefectural Committee Office, Gu Kedong, Chang Cheng, Southern Hebei Branch.)

Ningnan County, Southern Hebei, seizes the good opportunity after the rain to actively plant trees. After the rain fell on the 7th of this month, the county government sent telegrams to various districts according to the situation, urging them to seize the opportunity and launch a rainy season tree planting campaign from the beginning to the middle of the fu period, calling on each household to plant and keep alive one to five trees, and to plant willows, poplars and other trees in a planned manner along the river banks, and red vitex on the saline-alkali land in the eastern part of the Third District. More than 20,000 trees have now been planted.

　　察省、冀中、冀南
    积极开展雨季造林
  　破坏林木事件予以适当处理
    【本报综合消息】华北人民政府雨季造林指示下达后，察哈尔省的平西专区，冀中各地，及冀南宁南等地已有领导地展开这一工作。平西雨季植树七月初即已着手，入伏后，各县均组织工作组，结合锄苗、压肥、防洪等工作，领导群众全面展开造林运动。涞水伏前修理酸枣树四万七千余棵，荒地种树一千二百余亩，不少村子多超过计划，六区南城寺组织群众二百六十余人，即植树三万多棵，超过原计划一倍半。房山五个区三十八个村，已植果树、杨柳共六万八千五百余棵，种苗圃十五亩五分。为结合防汛，良乡靠小清河两岸村庄，在堤坝上植杨柳达六万四千六百余棵。涿、良、宛沿永定河、拒马河、大清河、小清河各村群众，亦正大量在堤坝、沙滩上种植防洪林、防风林。冀中八专区今春河堤植树十三万一千余棵，距全年计划尚差七万余棵，专署本月中特通知各县抓紧雨季，继续完成，并将春季未成活者补齐。束鹿六区史家庄有沟地一千六百亩土地，植树已达半数。易水地委月中发出指示，号召全专区各机关、部队、团体、学校、工厂、公营商店所有干部人员，雨季每人保证植活一棵树。现全专区已普遍展开这一工作。该专署并曾召开林木会议，检查前一阶段的准备工作，各县一般地均已引起注意，如满城永安庄等十村，仅黑枣树秧即各准备一千至二千棵，并开展了一把杏核运动，搜集洋槐籽，以备荒山播种。据完、唐、望、满、涞、易等六县统计，九个区六十六个村，已植树七万余棵，荒山播种五千六百余窝又十亩。完县三区在实际工作中以支部党员为核心领导，南长丰一村即压杨柳千窝。为了解除群众顾虑，各县均作了护林工作检查，对未解决的破坏林木事件予以适当处理，并有重点地发给群众林木证，提高了群众情绪。该专区雨季造林工作初期阶段的主要缺点，是领导上过分强调了群众没有习惯，未能更广泛地发动群众造成运动。个别区村尚存单纯任务观点，光图领导省事，叫自卫队集体种，违背了谁种归谁的原则，未按劳力确定林权。这些缺点已在纠正。（冀中分社、平西地委办公室、谷克东、常诚、冀南分社。）
    冀南宁南县抓紧雨后良机积极植树。县政府曾于本月七日落透雨后分别情况电示各区，抓紧时机，在头伏起至二伏之间，开展雨季植树运动，号召每户植活一棵至五棵，沿河两岸有计划的栽植柳、杨等树木，三区东部咸地栽红荆。现已植树两万余株。
