　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 19th. A movement to save and self-manufacture materials is unfolding in Nanjing's public and private enterprises. The slogan put forward by the power plant workers is "Ideologically, we do not rely on foreign countries; we try our best to overcome difficulties." They are now studying the self-manufacture of some parts of the generator. The electric lighting factory is also preparing to self-manufacture tungsten filaments for light bulbs. In the past, almost all the materials used by the radio factory came from the United States. After liberation, technicians and workers have given play to their creativity, and now they can self-manufacture some equipment such as small vacuum tubes, transformers, etc., and the products are no worse than American goods. On the 15th of this month, the responsible persons of each unit of the factory established a special team to start inspecting, sorting out, and appropriately using the existing materials in the factory, and to compile statistics on the materials needed in the future. They will establish close ties with other liberated cities to understand the supply of raw materials, and prepare to self-manufacture basic parts. The Jiangsu Postal Administration, under the principle of not hindering official duties, has re-adjusted the train schedules and issued fuel to each vehicle according to the fuel consumption standards stipulated by the Military Control Commission, saving 20 gallons of gasoline per day compared to before. In view of the difficulty in sourcing machine oil, the privately-owned Yongli ＠ factory has also launched a campaign to save machine oil.

　　南京公私企业中
  　开展自制材料运动
    无线电厂已能自制变压器、小型真空管等，不亚于美国货。
    【新华社南京十九日电】南京市公私营企业中正展开节省和自制材料的运动。电厂职工提出的口号是“思想上不依靠外国，尽量想办法克服困难”。他们现正研究自制发电机上的一些零件。电照厂也准备自制灯泡内的钨丝。无线电厂所用材料，过去几乎全部来自美国，解放后技师工人发挥自己的创造力，现在已能自制一部分器材如小型真空管、变压器等，且出品不差于美国货。本月十五日该厂各单位负责人员又成立专门小组，开始检查整理和适当运用该厂中现有材料，统计今后所需要材料，与其他解放区城市建立密切联系，了解原料的供给情况，并筹备自制基本零件。江苏邮政管理局，在不妨碍公务原则下，重行调整行车班次，并按军管会规定之耗油标准，核发各车用油，每日可较前节省汽油二十加仑。私营永利＠厂鉴于机器油来源困难，也发动了节约机器油的运动。
