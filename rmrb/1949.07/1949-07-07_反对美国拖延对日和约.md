　　Oppose the United States' Delay of the Peace Treaty with Japan
　　Lin Desheng
　　The Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945, stipulated: "The authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be eliminated permanently. For we insist that a new order of peace, security, and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world." Article 10 further stipulates: "The Japanese government must remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, religion, and thought, as well as respect for fundamental human rights, must be established." In other words, Japan must eradicate militarism and undergo thorough democratization. However, for more than three years, the US government's policy toward Japan has been contrary to this direction, aiming to maintain the forces of Japanese militarism and transform Japan into an important base for the US against the Soviet Union, communism, and people's democracy. As early as 1946, Republican Congressman Short of the US House Military Affairs Committee's Far East Inspection Group, after returning from inspection, stated: "A naval admiral told me that in the next war, the Japanese would be wearing American uniforms. The United States has secretly transported Japanese Kamikaze pilots back to the United States for training." In August of the same year, MacArthur, in a speech on the first anniversary of Japan's surrender, also emphasized the strategic position of the Japanese islands, pointing out that they would be "springboards for war."

　　To realize this policy, the United States has tried its best to prolong its unilateral occupation, so as to use its control power to shelter the forces of Japanese militarism. Since 1948, important US officials and army and navy generals have continuously emphasized the policy of long-term occupation. In September 1948, US Eighth Army Commander Eichelberger (now a Japan problem advisor to the Department of the Army in charge of the occupying forces in Japan) stated in a speech upon his retirement and return to the United States: "The US military cannot leave Japan until Japan has a police force sufficient to suppress communist demonstrators... We may have been too thorough in disarming Japan." After 1949, the slogan of long-term occupation became even louder. On February 11, Army Secretary Royall, who had recently been removed from office, claimed: "There are currently no plans to reduce our military presence in Japan." MacArthur also made absurd remarks: "America's strategy has been completely changed by the last war. At present, the Pacific has become a Saxon lake, and the line from the Philippines to the Ryukyu Islands, Japan, and the Aleutian Islands has become America's front line... Unfortunately, due to the post-war division of the Allies, Japan has become a stronghold that the United States should retain to protect British and American interests." On June 4, Van, head of the Allied General Headquarters' economic team, openly advocated "indefinitely delaying the peace treaty with Japan." On June 27, US Under Secretary of the Army Voorhees stated before the Senate Appropriations Committee that "the US occupation of Japan will continue for quite some time." When a senator asked how long the Army Department hoped to occupy, Voorhees replied, "No one knows how long it will take." To prolong military occupation, it is necessary to delay the peace treaty with Japan indefinitely. So, what methods does the United States use to delay the peace treaty with Japan?

　　The United States attempts to overturn the Potsdam Agreement and does not follow the procedures and steps that should be followed in the Potsdam Declaration regarding the discussion of the peace treaty with Japan; if a peace treaty according to the United States' intention cannot be concluded, it adopts a delaying attitude.

　　According to the Potsdam Declaration of August 3, 1945, the Council of Foreign Ministers should be the body responsible for preparing the peace treaty with Japan. Article 1 of the declaration states: "Agreement has been reached that an agreement shall be established that meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers representing the Five Great Powers shall be established to continue the necessary preparatory work for peacemaking. and to deal with other matters which the governments participating in the Council of Foreign Ministers may agree to submit to the Council of Foreign Ministers at any time." Article 3 further stipulates, "In carrying out the above tasks, the Council of Foreign Ministers will include the nations that signed the surrender terms imposed on the enemy countries concerned in each task." Therefore, according to the letter and spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, "the necessary preparatory work for peacemaking" is the responsibility of the Five Foreign Ministers' Meeting. The Soviet, American, British, and French Foreign Ministers' Meeting is responsible for the preparation of the peace treaty with Germany, while the Soviet, Chinese, American, and British Foreign Ministers' Meeting is responsible for the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan. Therefore, it is clear that the Council of Foreign Ministers is the body responsible for handling the preparatory work for the peace treaty with Japan. Since China is a country that signed the surrender terms imposed on Japan, the Council of Foreign Ministers to resolve the peace treaty with Japan should be composed of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States.

　　To date, among the countries concerned, there have been two proposals to convene a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan: On July 16, 1947, the United States unilaterally proposed to hold a preliminary meeting in Washington on August 19 of that year; on May 23, 1949, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky suggested at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Meeting that a Council of Foreign Ministers with Chinese participation be convened regularly in accordance with the principles of the Potsdam Agreement to prepare for the peace treaty with Japan. These two proposals fully demonstrate the struggle between maintaining the Potsdam Declaration and destroying the Potsdam Declaration.

　　The US proposal in 1947 advocated that the preparatory work for the peace treaty with Japan should be carried out by the eleven-nation conference participating in the Far Eastern Commission, without going through the Council of Foreign Ministers. At the same time, a majority vote system was adopted at this conference, and the four powers were not allowed to exercise veto power. This suggestion was clearly intended to bypass the Soviet Union's opposition and realize the will of American imperialism by relying on the majority it could manipulate. Although the United States' unilateral proposal was agreed by its accomplice, British imperialism (Britain only requested a postponement and asked India and Pakistan to participate), on July 22, the Soviet government replied, opposing the United States' unilateral decision without consulting other countries. It suggested that the Council of Foreign Ministers should conduct the meeting. On November 27, the Soviet government formally notified the British, American, and Chiang governments, suggesting that a Council of Foreign Ministers with the participation of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and Britain be held in China in January 1948 to prepare for the peace treaty with Japan. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government, in accordance with the US imperialist will, suggested that the Far Eastern Commission be responsible for preparing the peace treaty and proceed in accordance with the commission's voting procedures, that is, adopting a two-thirds majority system, but should include the unanimous consent of the four powers.

　　The United States has also attempted to sign a separate peace treaty. As early as May 1947, former President Hoover, a prominent American reactionary figure, proposed in a speech that the United States sign a separate peace treaty with Japan. On May 29 of the same month, Marshall also expressed great interest in Hoover's proposal at a press conference. In 1948, US Under Secretary of the Army Draper stated that if the Soviet Union did not agree, they would bypass the Soviet Union and act alone. However, whether it was the United States' unilateral decision to conduct the preparatory work for the peace treaty with the recommendation of the eleven-nation conference, or the threat of signing a separate peace treaty with Japan, it could not be realized due to the opposition of the Soviet Union, the opposition of the Chinese people, and the opposition of peace-loving people around the world.

　　In May 1949, Vyshinsky formally proposed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference that a Foreign Ministers' Conference with the participation of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and Britain be convened to discuss the peace treaty with Japan. Acheson initially used the excuse that this was a complex issue to prevaricate, and later repeated his old tune, saying that the Council of Foreign Ministers was not the body to conduct the meeting and that it should be handled by a body composed of the Far Eastern Commission. But as proven above, these suggestions are not in line with the Potsdam principles. After rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal, US Under Secretary of the Army Voorhees and his ilk even loudly voiced the absurd theory of long-term occupation of Japan. The United States' plot to delay the peace treaty is fully exposed.

　　For the sake of lasting peace in the Far East, it is necessary to stop the US plot to use military occupation to support Japanese reactionary forces and turn Japan into its forward base against the Soviet Union, communism, and people's democracy in East Asia. The Chinese people, who persisted in the arduous eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and paid the price of countless lives and property, have full right to demand that a Council of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and Britain be convened promptly in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Potsdam Declaration to prepare for the peace treaty with Japan, terminate the current military occupation of the United States and its perverse actions, and realize the democratization and demilitarization of Japan. This demand is completely in line with the interests of peace-loving people around the world.

　　反对美国拖延对日和约
    林得胜
    一九四五年七月二十六日，波茨坦宣言曾经规定：“欺骗及错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界者之威权及势力，必须永久剔除。盖吾人坚持非将负责之穷兵黩武主义驱出世界，则和平安全及正义之新秩序势不可能。”第十条中又规定：“日本政府必须将阻止日本人民民主趋势之复兴及增强之所有障碍，予以消除，言论宗教及思想自由以及对于基本人权之重视，必须成立。”换句话说，就是日本必须根绝军国主义，必须进行彻底的民主化。但三年多以来，美国政府的对日政策，却一反这个方向，而以保持日本军国主义势力，变日本为美国反苏、反共、反人民民主的重要基地为目的。早在一九四六年，美国众议院军事委员会远东视察团的共和党议员萧特在视察回国后，就说道：“一海军上将告余，在下次战争时，日本人将穿着美国军装。美国已秘密将日本神风队飞行员运回美国训练。”同年八月，麦克阿瑟在日本投降一周年演说中，也强调日本各岛的军略地位，指明将为“战争的跳板”。
    为了实现这一政策，美国尽量延长单方面占领，得以利用其管制权力，来庇护日本的军国主义力量。一九四八年以还，美国重要官员和陆海军将领就不断强调长期占领的政策。一九四八年九月，美国第八军军长艾契柏格（即驻日占领军现改任陆军部日本问题顾问）在退休返美时，曾发表演说称：“直至日本能有足以镇压共党示威者的警察力量以前，美军不能离日……。在美军解除日本武装时，我们或太嫌彻底。”一九四九年以后，长期占领的口号，提得越发响亮了。二月十一日，不久前才行去职的陆军部长罗耀尔声称：“现在并无任何减少吾人在日本驻军的计划。”麦克阿瑟也大放厥词，“美国之战略业因上次战争而完全改观，目前太平洋已成为撒克逊湖，自菲律宾往琉球群岛、日本以至阿留申群岛已成为美国之前卫线……不幸由于战后盟国之分裂，日本已成为美国应保有之保障英美权益的据点。”六月四日，盟总经济组组长范恩公开主张“无限期延缓对日和约”，六月二十七日，美陆军部次长伏利斯在参院拨款委员会上声称，“美国对日占领将继续一颇长时期。”当议员询问陆军部希望占领多久时，伏竟答称，“没有人知道要多久。”要延长军事占领就必须无限期地拖延对日和约。那么，美国采用什么办法来拖延对日和约呢？
    美国企图推翻波茨坦的协定，不依照波茨坦宣言中关于讨论对日和约所应遵循的程序与步骤；如不能缔结按照美国的意旨的和约，就采取拖延的态度。
    根据一九四五年八月三日的波茨坦宣言，外长会议应当是准备对日和约的机构。宣言第一条称：“会议获得协议，应建立代表五大国的外长会议，以继续进行缔造和平的必要准备工作。并负责处理参与外长会议各政府同意而可能随时提交外长会议之其他事宜。”第三条又规定，“为执行上述任务，外长会议将包括强加于各项任务所关的敌国的投降条款上签字的国家。”因此，依照波茨坦宣言的文字与精神，“缔造和平的必要准备工作”是由五国外长会议负责，由苏美英法外长会议负责对德和约准备工作，而由苏中美英外交会议负责对日和约准备工作。所以，很显然的，外长会议乃是处理对日和约准备工作的机构，由于中国是强加于日本投降条款上签字的国家，所以解决对日和约的外长会议，应当由中苏英美四国组成。
    迄今为止，在有关国家间，提出召开对日和约准备会议的共有两次：一九四七年七月十六日，美国单方面提出，要在该年八月十九日于华盛顿召开初步会议；一九四九年五月二十三日，苏外长维辛斯基在巴黎外长会议上，建议依照波茨坦协定的原则定期召集有中国参加的外长会议，以准备对日和约。这两次提出都充分地表现出维护波茨坦宣言与破坏波茨坦宣言之间的斗争。
    一九四七年美国的提议，主张不经过外长会议，而由参加远东委员会的十一国会议，来进行对日和约准备工作，同时，在这次会议中，采用多数表决制，四强均不得行使否决权。这一建议显然是想绕过苏联的反对，借美国所能操纵的多数，实现美国帝国主义的意旨。美国单方面的提议，虽然获得其帮凶英帝国主义的同意（英国仅要求延期举行并要求印度与巴基斯坦参加），但七月二十二日，苏联政府复文，反对美国不事先征求他国意见，而擅自做出决定。并建议由外长会议进行。十一月二十七日，苏政府并正式照会英美蒋政府，建议于一九四八年一月，在中国召开由苏中美英参加的外长会议，准备对日和约。蒋匪政府则依照美帝的意旨，建议由远东委员会负责准备对日和约工作，并依照该会的表决程序进行，即采用三分之二的多数制，惟应包括四强的一致同意。
    美国也曾经企图单独签订和约。早在一九四七年五月，美国著名反动头子前总统胡佛即曾在一次发言中，提议美国单独对日签订和约。同月二十九日，马歇尔在记者招待会中也表示对胡佛提议极感兴趣。一九四八年，美陆军部次长德莱柏表示了如果苏联不同意，就绕过苏联来单独行动。但不论是美国的片面决定由十一国会议进行准备对日和约的建议，或单独对日签订和约的威吓，都因受到苏联的反对，中国人民的反对，全世界爱好和平的人民的反对，而不能实现。
    一九四九年五月，维辛斯基在外长会议里，正式提出召开由苏中美英参加的外长会议来讨论对日和约。艾奇逊最初以这是一个复杂问题为搪塞，后来则仍旧重弹以前的老调，说什么外长会议不是进行的机构，说什么应由远东委员会组成的机构去处理。但恰如上面所证明的，这些建议都与波茨坦原则不相符合。在拒绝了苏联建议之后，美国陆军次长伏利斯之流，竟高弹长期占领日本的谰调。美国拖延和约的阴谋，乃暴露无遗了。
    为了远东的持久和平，必须制止美国利用军事占领、以扶植日本反动势力、把日本变为其在东亚的反苏、反共、反人民民主的前进基地的阴谋。坚持了八年的艰苦抗日战争，付出了无数生命财产的代价的中国人民，有充分的权利要求迅速按照波茨坦宣言的文字和精神召开苏中美英外长会议，准备对日和约，终止美国目前的军事占领及其倒行逆施，而实现日本民主化与非军国主义化。这一要求是与全世界爱好和平的人民的利益完全一致的。
