Technical Problems of Afforestation in the Rainy Season
North China People's Government Ministry of Agriculture Huang Shu

In North China, spring is dry for nine out of ten years, making it difficult to plant trees in high and dry areas. However, during the continuous rains of July and August, taking advantage of this rainy season for afforestation is of particular importance. Farmers in many villages along the Shayhe River, Tanghe River, and Cihe River in western Hebei have long had habits and experience in this regard. The following is a summary of the results of our investigations, experiments, and promotions of rainy season afforestation in this area in recent years, for reference.

What trees are best to plant during the rainy season?

(1) Dry sandy wasteland

Populus simonii (小叶杨, *xiǎo yè yáng*, small-leaved poplar) has the strongest adaptability. On barren sandy ridges or dry riverbanks, take advantage of heavy rain to use finger-thick branches for layering afforestation. They will root and sprout in about a week. The original branches and leaves often do not wither, or only the tender shoots dry out a little. Last year, the survival rate of branches layered by villages in Tang County and Xingtang County on dry sandy wasteland was 70% to 95%. Although some new branches dried out after winter, the new branches and leaves that sprouted this spring are brightly colored and exceptionally strong. Early rainy season *Populus simonii* forests in the area grow very lushly. If the leaves are falling during layering, cut off the tender shoots to reduce water and nutrient consumption, making it easier to survive.

River willows can also sprout in such dry and barren sandy land in the year they are planted, but they often die from drought after winter or the following year after sprouting. Therefore, some farmers say that willows are not considered alive until three years.

*Pyrus betulifolia* (杜梨, *dù lí*, birchleaf pear) and *Ziziphus jujuba* var. *spinosa* (酸枣, *suān zǎo*, wild jujube) can also be planted during the rainy season in dry sandy land to create windbreaks. After afforestation and improvement, jujube trees can be planted during the rain in sandy land with more fine soil, or *Pyrus betulifolia* can be grafted into pear trees, or *Ziziphus jujuba* var. *spinosa* can be grafted into jujube trees.

In addition, *Sophora alopecuroides* (野槐花, *yě huái huā*, foxtail-like sophora), *Lespedeza* (马扫, *mǎ sào*, bushclover) and other perennial herbs are sown in the sandy wasteland between Xingtang and Zhengding during the rainy season to prevent wind and sand, and can be cut annually for firewood.

For afforestation in such dry and barren sandy wasteland, dense planting is essential, so that the trees can shade each other within two or three years, strengthen the role of wind and sand prevention, maintain the moisture and fine soil of the forest land, and accumulate dust brought by the wind, improving the soil and making the trees grow more vigorously. Conversely, if the trees are planted sparsely, they cannot protect each other, and they will grow weaker and become deformed. Therefore, when using poplars, *Pyrus betulifolia*, etc. to create windbreaks, the spacing between plants should not exceed five feet, and at least two rows of forest belts should be planted.

(2) Wet river滩地 (tāndì, shallows, beaches) along the river

*Populus simonii*, river willows, *Salix integra* (杞柳, *qǐ liǔ*, Hakuro nishiki willow), *Tamarix chinensis* (柽柳, *chēng liǔ*, Chinese tamarisk), reeds and *Triarrhena lutariorhizoma* (荻, *dí*, cogongrass) etc. can be combined with rainy season river management and flood control work to build shelterbelts along rivers to protect滩地 and embankments.

Last year, Diaoyutai Village in Tang County used river willow layering and cuttings to create more than 12,000 holes for shelterbelts, with a survival rate of over 95%. Shao堤 (dī, embankment) Village on the opposite bank achieved the same results by layering *Populus simonii* the year before. Some nearby villages transplanted wild *Populus simonii* and river willow seedlings (two years old) from the river灘地 to the embankment, and all of them survived, and the original leaves did not turn yellow and fall.

Some villages along the Tanghe River and Shayhe River used bow-shaped layering method to create poplar and willow mother tree forests last year during the rainy season, with very good results. The so-called bow-shaped layering involves digging a pit one and a half to two feet deep, one foot wide, and one and a half feet long, and bundling two or three finger-thick poplar and willow branches together, bending them into a bow shape, burying both ends downwards at the bottom of the pit, with the back of the bow facing upwards, just exposing it to the ground. The branches will root at both ends that year, and buds will grow in the middle to form long branches. After winter, a section will dry out, and many new branches will sprout the following spring. Each finger-thick original branch can produce three to fifteen new branches, growing into small trees. After another year, a large number of tree seedlings can be harvested. This is a very suitable method for creating mother tree forests.

Along the Shayhe River, it is customary to layer reeds and insert cogongrass during the second伏 (*fú*, a period in the lunar calendar) of summer. That is, the reed stalks are cut down completely and laid flat on the wet灘地. A shovel of soil is pressed on every other node, or a three-inch deep ditch is dug to bury the reed stalks with leaves. After a few days, buds will sprout and root from the nodes. Similarly, cogongrass is cut and inserted into the wet ground, and it is also easy to survive. Such layering and inserting does not damage the roots of the reeds and cogongrass (rooting reeds in spring will damage the reed fields), and can reproduce in large quantities. In addition, during the rainy season, reed roots are often washed down the river. Collecting them and pressing them on the滩地 makes them easiest to survive.

In alkaline滩地, *Salix integra* and *Tamarix chinensis* cuttings or layering can be used for afforestation during the rainy season, which are easy to survive.

(3) Mountain areas

Farmers in the mountainous areas of western Hebei are mostly accustomed to taking advantage of heavy rain during the first伏 of summer to transplant jujube seedlings on slopes, which are very easy to survive. However, locations in the mountains that easily accumulate rainwater and sediment should be selected, and larger pits should be dug so that a pool can be left after planting to store rainwater. Seedlings that are about two feet tall, strong-growing, and have well-developed roots are the best. At the end of July last year, Dongbaoshui Village in Tang County used slopes to plant more than 5,000 jujube trees, all without watering (planted after透雨, *tòu yǔ*, thorough rain). Most of them sprouted that year. As of mid-June this year, inspections showed that more than half of them had sprouted. One household that planted better had 80% sprouting.

Evergreen trees such as *Platycladus orientalis* (侧柏, *cè bǎi*, Chinese arborvitae) and *Picea asperata* (云杉, *yún shān*, dragon spruce) are easy to survive when transplanted to mountains during the rainy season. Last year, the Wutai Mountain Forestry Bureau transplanted wild dragon spruce seedlings (two or three years old) on high mountains, with a survival rate of 95%. Huolu and Pingxi Forest Farms have successful experience in transplanting *Platycladus orientalis* seedlings for afforestation during the rainy season.

Seeds of *Ailanthus altissima* (臭椿, *chòu chūn*, tree of heaven), *Vitex negundo* (荆条, *jīng tiáo*, Chinese chastetree), *Ulmus pumila* (榆树, *yú shù*, Siberian elm) and other small-grained seeds are directly sown or strip-sown on mountain slopes with thicker soil layers at the beginning of the rainy season, with good results. In the past two years, trials in Fuping, Huolu, and other places have resulted in more than half of the seedlings emerging and growing well. As for large seeds such as peaches and apricots, they are not easy to germinate in the year they are sown during the rainy season.

Matters needing attention in rainy season afforestation

(1) Rainy season afforestation in dry areas is easy to survive and can save the labor of watering, which is its advantage. However, on the other hand, because the buds on the tree seedlings have not yet fully developed during the rainy season, the new branches that sprout after planting are relatively weak, and most of the tender shoots will dry out in winter. The following year, new seedlings will sprout from older branches. Therefore, if half of the branches are removed during planting, or all the above-ground branches and stems are cut off in the autumn of the same year, then new seedlings will re-sprout from the ground the following year, and will be exceptionally vigorous.

(2) Rainy season afforestation must be carried out after a thorough rain during continuous rainy days. The timing is difficult to grasp. If it is too early, the farmers are busy weeding the seedlings. If it is too late, the growing season after afforestation is too short, and the seedlings are not easy to overwinter. The most suitable time is from mid-July to early August, taking advantage of the agricultural slack during the rain. Because the time is short, preparations must be made.

(3) During the rainy season, river water rises sharply, transportation is inconvenient, and tree seedlings cannot be stored for a long time. They cannot be transported on sunny days. Adjusting tree seedlings can only be carried out within ten to twenty里 (lǐ, a Chinese unit of distance, approximately 500 meters) along the river, so that seedlings can be taken and planted on the same day. Poplar and willow branches should be cut and layered immediately.

(4) For rainy season afforestation, stronger two- or three-year-old tree branches and seedlings should be selected, so that they can quickly recover and grow after afforestation, and the tissues are more complete by winter, making them resistant to freezing and drought. For example, Diaoyutai Village in Tang County used two-year-old poplar and willow branches to layer river灘地 forests two years ago, with a survival rate of 95%. However, at the same time and in the same place, using poplar and willow branches with a thickness of two or three inches for pole insertion afforestation, although most of them sprouted at the time, the sprouting was very late. By winter, the bark peeled off, and the survival rate was less than 5%. For example, last year during the rainy season, villages in the Fifth District of Tang County planted more than 24,000 jujube trees. In mid-June this year, inspections showed that the ones that had sprouted were all small seedlings with a height of one and a half to two feet, and very few of the larger ones had sprouted. For direct sowing afforestation during the rainy season, it is also necessary to use tree species and perennial herbs with smaller seeds that are easy to germinate, so that they can germinate and grow immediately after sowing in order to overwinter.

(5) In short, rainy season afforestation has both advantages and disadvantages, and it is of particular importance in dry areas. We should vigorously promote it in areas with customs and conditions based on its characteristics. In other areas, small-scale experimental promotion can be carried out to gradually develop the habit of afforestation in three seasons a year, striving to plant trees in one year that would take three years, accelerating the restoration and development of forestry in North China, reducing disasters such as wind, sand, drought, and hail, and increasing the production of timber and fruits to support and promote the construction of a new democratic economy.

　　雨季造林的技术问题
    华北人民政府农业部  黄舒
    华北春季十年九旱，高燥地方种树造林不易成活，而在七八月间，则伏雨连绵，利用这个多雨季节造林，有特殊重要的意义。冀西沙河、唐河与慈河沿岸不少村庄的农民对此已有长期的习惯与经验，兹将近年我们在这一带进行调查、试验与推广雨季造林所得结果，摘要介绍，以供参考。
    雨季栽什么树最好　
    （一）干燥沙荒地
    以小叶杨适应能力最强，在瘠薄之沙岗上或旱河旁，趁着大雨用手指粗的枝子压条造林，经一周左右即可生根发芽，原有枝叶往往不凋谢或仅干掉一点嫩梢。去年唐县、行唐各村在干燥沙荒所压的树枝，成活在百分之七十至九十五，经冬新枝虽干掉一段，但今春新发枝叶，色泽浓艳，异常粗壮。当地早年雨季小叶杨林，生长很茂盛。压条时如将掉叶子，切去嫩梢，减少水份养份消耗，更易成活。
    河柳，在这种干瘠沙地，栽后当年虽亦发芽，经冬寒或至次年发芽后往往旱死，所以有些农民说，柳树三年不算活。
    杜梨酸枣在干沙地也能利用雨季栽植，造成防风林带，经造林改良后，含细土较多的沙地，更可趁雨栽植枣树或栽杜树接成梨树，或以酸枣接成枣树。
    此外野槐花（苦参、野槐卜子）马扫等宿根草类，在行唐正定间的沙荒上，均利用雨季播种，以防止风沙，并可供每年割取作柴火用。
    在这种干瘠沙荒造林，必须密植，以求树木在两三年内互相荫蔽，加强防御风沙的作用，保持林地的水份与细土，并积集由风带来的尘土，改良土壤，使林木愈长愈旺，反之，如果栽得稀疏，则林木不能互相保护，愈长愈弱，变成畸形，所以用杨、杜梨等造防风林时，株距不宜超过五尺，而且要栽两行以上的林带。
    （二）沿河湿润滩地
    小叶杨、河柳、杞柳、柽柳（红荆）及苇荻等，均可结合雨季治河防汛工作，在沿河建造护滩护堤林。
    去年唐县钓鱼台村用河柳压条与插枝造护滩林一万二千余穴，成活百分之九十五以上，对岸的勺堤村前年用小叶杨压条，也得到同样的效果。附近有些村子把河滩上野生的小叶杨与河柳苗（二年生）移植于堤畔，全数成活，且原有叶子不黄落。
    唐河与沙河沿岸有些村子去年雨季用弓形压条法造杨柳母树林，效果很好，所谓弓形压条，就是挖深一尺半至二尺，宽一尺长一尺半的坑，把两三根手指粗的杨柳条并做一束，弯成弓形，两头朝下埋入坑底，弓背朝上，刚使露出地面，当年枝条两头扎根，当中发芽长枝，经冬干掉一段，第二年春天便萌发很多新枝，每根手指粗的原枝，能抽出三至十五个新枝，长成小树，再过一年，即可割取大量树秧。要造母树林这是很适宜的方法。
    沙河沿岸习惯在二伏天压苇插荻，就是把苇子杆整个割下来，平放在湿润的滩地上，每隔一节压上一锨土，或挖三寸深的沟把苇杆带叶埋入，数天后即由节上发芽生根，同样把荻子割下插在湿润地，也易成活，这样压杆插杆，不伤苇荻根部（春季压苇根要伤苇田），且能大量繁殖，又雨季河中往往有苇根冲下来，收集起来压在滩上最易成活。
    带有碱性的滩地，雨季用杞柳（柳子）柽柳（山用柳、红荆）插条或压条造林，均易成活。
    （三）山地
    冀西山地农民，多习惯于头伏趁大雨移植枣苗于坡埝上，很易成活，但须选山间容易积存雨水泥沙的地点，刨大一点的坑，以便栽好以后留一池子，积存雨水。苗子以二尺来高，生长强健且根部发达的最好，去年七月底唐县东雹水村利用坡埝栽枣五千余株，均未浇水（透雨后栽植）当年绝大部分已发芽，至今年六月中检查，已有半数以上发芽，其中有一户栽得较好的，已有八成发芽。
    侧柏、云杉（杆）等常绿树，利用雨季迁植山上，很易成活，去年五台山林牧局在高山上移植二三年生之野生杆苗，成活百分之九十五，获鹿及平西林场在雨季移植柏苗造林，都有成功的经验。
    臭椿、荆条、榆树等小粒种子，在雨季开始时直接点播或条播于土层较厚的山坡上，效果很好，过去两年在阜平、获鹿等地试播，均有半数以上出苗，生长很好。至于桃杏等大颗种子，雨季播种当年不易发芽。
    雨季造林应注意的事项
    （一）雨季在干燥地方造林，既易成活，又可免浇水之劳，这是它的优点；但另一方面，因雨季树秧上的芽尚未发育健全，栽后所发新枝，比较纤弱，到冬季嫩梢即大部干掉，第二年再由较老枝条萌芽，因此在栽植时如把枝梢去掉一半，或在当年秋后把地上枝干全剪去，则至次年重新自地皮萌发新苗，异常茂盛。
    （二）雨季造林，须在透雨后趁着连雨天进行，时间较难掌握，过早则农民正忙于锄热苗，过晚则造林后生长期太短，苗木不易越冬。最适宜的时间，是在七月中至八月初，趁着雨中农隙进行，因时间短促，准备工作必须做好。
    （三）雨季河水暴涨，交通不便，树木又正在生长，树秧不能久放，晴天更不能搬运，调剂树秧，只能顺着河流方向在一二十里内进行，以便当天起苗当天栽，杨柳枝条要现砍现压。
    （四）雨季造林宜选较强健的二三年生树枝及树苗，以求造林后能很快的恢复生长，至冬季组织已较健全，可耐冻旱，如唐县勺堤村前年雨季用二年生的杨柳条压条造河滩林，成活达百分之九十五。但同时同地用粗二三寸的杨柳枝插杆造林，当时大部分虽已发芽，但发芽很晚，至冬季树皮脱离，成活不及百分之五，又如唐县五区各村去年雨季共栽枣树二万四千余株，今年六月中旬检查，已经发芽的都是高一尺半至二尺的小苗，较大的绝少发芽，雨季直接播种造林，也要用种子较小容易发芽的树种及宿根草类，使播后即发芽生长，才能越冬。
    （五）总之，雨季造林既有优点又有缺点，而在干燥地方，则有特殊的重要性。我们应当根据它的特点，在有习惯有条件的地区大力推动。其他地区，可进行少量的试验性推广，逐渐养成一年三季造林的习惯，争取以一年时间栽三年的树，加速华北林业的恢复与发展，减免风沙旱雹等灾害，并增产木材果品，以支持并促进新民主主义经济建设。
