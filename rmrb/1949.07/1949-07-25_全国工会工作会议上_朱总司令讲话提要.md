Comrades:

Since the Sixth National Labor Congress was held last August and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was established, trade union work has made remarkable achievements in various places. Today, when the Chinese people's democratic revolution has basically achieved a nationwide victory, convening such a national trade union work conference is of great significance and carries great tasks.

(1) First of all, we must recognize the position of the working class today. In the new democratic China, the working class has been politically liberated. The workers themselves deeply realize that they have been liberated. They are no longer the ruled class, but the ruling class, the leading class in the new democratic regime, and the masters of the new democratic country. The employees of state-owned enterprises in the new democratic country have been liberated not only politically but also economically. They are no longer exploited, and they are no longer working for capitalists, but for the country, for the people, and for the working class itself. Because state-owned enterprises belong to the country, to the people, and first and foremost to the working class itself. The employees in private capitalist enterprises have not yet achieved complete economic liberation, and they are still subject to capitalist exploitation. This exploitation can only be restricted in the new democratic period, but cannot be eliminated. The existence of the system means that the contradiction cannot be resolved for a while. However, at the same time, these enterprises are private capitalist enterprises under the new democratic regime, and these enterprises can only operate according to the track stipulated by the new democratic regime led by the working class. Therefore, the employees in private capitalist enterprises under the new democratic regime must consciously accept the policy of benefiting both labor and capital economically. This policy of allowing the existence of private capital and implementing the policy of benefiting both labor and capital is absolutely necessary for a long period of time. Only when the Chinese working class leads the new China well, builds it well, and steadily transforms it from an agricultural country into an industrial country, can it be possible to transition from new democracy to socialism, and the working class can achieve complete liberation. This is the fundamental interest of the working class. For this purpose, at the present stage, consciously enduring a certain degree of exploitation by capitalists is to subordinate local and temporary interests to fundamental and long-term interests. Our Communist Party members and trade union workers must educate the workers with this spirit and lead the trade union work. Otherwise, we will fall into the quagmire of economism and tailism. We will not be the vanguard of the proletariat, and we will not be able to correctly organize and lead the workers to complete the historical task of new democracy and transition to socialism. Why? Because, at the present stage, in politics, the working class must unite with the liberal bourgeoisie who are willing to cooperate with us to jointly oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Economically, China's economy is backward, and the proportion of industry and agriculture in the national economy, on a national scale, is about 10% for industry and 90% for agriculture. Chairman Mao instructed us: "This is the basic starting point for all issues during the period of the Chinese revolution and in a considerably long period after the victory of the revolution."

(2) Precisely because the working class is the leading class of the new democratic country, the working class not only leads the bourgeoisie politically, but also leads the private capitalist economy through the state power and state-owned economy it leads, so that it serves the development of production and the prosperity of the economy under the principle of benefiting both public and private interests, and labor and capital. We must restrict private capitalism so that it cannot manipulate the national economy and move in a direction that is beneficial rather than harmful to the national economy. However, on the other hand, we must also remember Chairman Mao's instructions: "For the interests of the entire national economy and for the present and future interests of the proletariat and the working people, private capitalism must not be restricted too much or too rigidly. They must be allowed to have room for existence and development within the orbit of the economic policies and economic plans of the People's Republic." Private capitalism, which exists and develops within the orbit of the economic policies and economic plans of the People's Republic, is an indispensable part of the current entire national economy and is a force that cannot be ignored. The working class, as the leading class of the new democratic country, should not only regard the state-owned economy as its own wealth, but also regard the private capitalist economy as the social wealth of the country it leads.

(3) Therefore, the working class in state-owned enterprises should face production, learn management, learn administration, improve politics, and improve culture. The workers in state-owned enterprises are part of the working class, and the administrative cadres in state-owned enterprises are also part of the working class. There should be no contradiction between the two at all. The source of some of the uncoordinated phenomena that currently exist is either due to the economistic tendencies among the workers or the bureaucratic tendencies among the administrative cadres. The trade unions in public enterprises should regard these two tendencies as ideological tendencies of some members within the trade union, and criticize, educate and correct them. It is wrong for the trade unions in state-owned enterprises to oppose the administrative cadres because they reflect the economistic tendencies of backward workers, and it is also incorrect to adopt an antagonistic attitude in order to oppose the bureaucratic tendencies of administrative cadres. On the other hand, administrative cadres should attach importance to trade union work, support trade union work as much as possible, and enhance the prestige of trade unions among the workers. They should know that the fundamental difference between the new democratic management of production and bureaucratic capitalism is that bureaucratic capitalism relies on coercion and oppression of workers, while we rely on the workers' consciousness. Therefore, the democratization of management and the democratic style of administrative cadres are of particular importance. Trade union work must be done well in order to more easily realize the democratization of management and mobilize the conscious labor enthusiasm of all employees to improve production. In short, in state-owned enterprises, administrative cadres who represent the state in managing production, workers who directly engage in production labor, and trade union work cadres are all the working class. Their tasks are consistent, that is, to do a good job in production. This is the requirement of the state and the requirement of the working class.

In private enterprises, there are two opposing classes, the capitalists and the workers. The trade union is the class organization of the working class and should unswervingly defend the interests of the working class. However, the interests of the working class do not mean unlimited wage increases and unlimited improvements in life. If so, that is the line of economism. It is the emotion of backward workers, not the real interests of the working class. Under the new democratic regime, trade unions in private capitalist enterprises must also educate workers so that they understand the long-term and fundamental interests of the working class, develop production under the principle of benefiting both labor and capital, and strive to learn and improve themselves in production. Of course, in private enterprises, it is not enough to rely solely on government laws and supervision to achieve mutual benefit for labor and capital. Capitalists have various ways to try to deduct workers' wages and increase exploitation profits. It is necessary to go through a certain appropriate struggle by workers to realize mutual benefit. In this struggle between workers and capitalists, the trade union should firmly represent the workers.

(4) Does this mean that trade unions should not strive for possible improvements in the working class's life and workers' welfare? No, the Party and the trade union, first and foremost the People's Government, must guarantee the minimum life of the working class and strive for possible improvements in the working class's life. However, improvements in the working class's life are only possible through the development of production. Now, many large, medium and small cities have been liberated. In addition to guaranteeing the minimum life of the workers, we generally cannot make much improvement in it (of course, the political life of the working class has been fundamentally improved, liberated, and free). Because, first, the old Chinese cities, especially the large cities, were the "prosperity" of the imperialist colonial economy; it was the "prosperity" built on the ruins of feudalism, plundering the fat of the peasants. To transform into a new democratic city, a productive city, generally requires a considerable process, and at present it is in a transitional period of transformation. Second, the destruction of the war for more than ten years, in the past, the revolutionary countryside surrounded the counter-revolutionary-ruled cities, and the rural areas blockaded the urban-rural relations. Now that the cities have been liberated, it is necessary to establish new urban-rural mutual assistance relations and restore the urban-rural economic ties that have been destroyed for many years, which also requires a considerable process, and at present it is also in this transitional period of transformation. Due to these two major reasons, the restoration and maintenance of industrial production in many newly liberated cities is already very difficult, and development is even more out of the question. Many state-owned enterprises are barely maintaining production under the conditions of state subsidies, and many enterprises cannot compete with foreign goods at all due to high production costs. At present, they continue to survive under the conditions of implementing a certain import and export control. Under such circumstances, the minimum life of the working class must also be guaranteed. However, in addition to guaranteeing the minimum life of the workers and persuading and educating the workers to struggle hard to overcome the difficulties, how can we improve treatment and increase wages? Of course, some places, such as the Northeast, are in a better situation, and the lives of workers can also be slightly improved within the possible range. However, it should also be noted that certain special profits generated under special conditions are not the surplus value of workers' labor under normal conditions. This special profit should be collected by the state in the form of taxes to support the war and accumulate capital for industrialization. It should never be made into capitalists' profits, nor should it be used to increase wages and improve the lives of some workers, making them too prominent. The set of methods implemented by the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital in the China Textile Corporation, which made the wages of the China Textile Corporation workers prominently high, was a method of buying off some workers and dividing the unity of the working class, which we should never adopt. Our policy is to develop production and, on the basis of developing production, improve the lives of workers as much as possible. In fact, as production develops, the wealth of the people increases, and the living standards of the people also increase, and the lives of workers also increase. Taking the improvement of workers' lives as a prerequisite for the development of industrial production is putting the cart before the horse. It is a suicidal policy to not pay attention to the development of production and to haggle over the improvement of workers' lives.

In short, the ultimate goal of the revolution is to develop production. It is necessary to develop production in order to support the current liberation war that has not yet ended; it is necessary to develop production in order to build a new China, transform China from an agricultural country into an industrial country, and then transition from new democracy to socialism, especially to develop industry. Developing production and developing industry are the demands of the Chinese people, the demands of the working class, and the demands of our Party.

As the class organization of the working class, the trade union, under the new democratic regime, its task should first be to face production. The necessary struggle against capitalists in private enterprises is also for the purpose of realizing mutual benefit for labor and capital and developing production. In state-owned enterprises, it should be to unite all employees, overcome bureaucracy and complete production tasks.

Secondly, the trade union should become a school for the working class. It is a school for managing production and also a school for the working class to implement class education.

Finally, the trade union is an important pillar of the new democratic regime and a transmission belt for the Party to contact the workers. The Party's industrial policy, industrial plan, wage policy, and labor-capital relations policy are all deeply rooted in the workers through the trade union and realized by the workers. Therefore, comrades working in the trade union should strive to make the trade union become the Party's most important lever for contacting the workers and realizing the Party's policies in the industrial field and among the workers.

Today I will only talk about these points for your reference in the discussion. (End)

### 全国工会工作会议上　朱总司令讲话提要

　　全国工会工作会议上
  　朱总司令讲话提要
    同志们：
    自从去年八月第六次全国劳动大会的召开和全国总工会成立以来，工会工作，在各地都有显著的成绩。现在，在中国人民民主革命基本上已经取得全国胜利的今天，召开这样一个全国性的工会工作会议，其意义与任务是很大的。
    （一）首先，我们要认清工人阶级今天所处的地位。在新民主主义的中国，工人阶级在政治上，已获得解放，工人们，自己也深切体验到，他们自己，是解放了，他们已不是被统治阶级，而是统治阶级，而是新民主主义政权中的领导阶级，新民主主义国家的主人翁。新民主主义国家国营企业的职工，不但在政治上，而且也在经济上获得了解放，他们已不再受人剥削，已不是为资本家做工，而是为国家为人民，为工人阶级自己做工了。因为国营企业，是国家的，是人民的，首先也就是工人阶级自己的。私人资本主义企业中的职工，他们在经济上还没有获得完全解放，他们还受着资本家剥削。这种剥削，在新民主主义时期，只能够受到限制，而不能够消灭。制度的存在，矛盾一时不能解除的，但同时这些企业，是新民主主义政权下的私人资本主义企业，这些企业只能依照工人阶级为领导的新民主主义政权所规定的轨道运转。因此，新民主主义政权下私人资本主义企业中的职工，在经济上要自觉地接受劳资两利的政策。这种容许私人资本存在和实行劳资两利政策的方针，在一个长时期内是完全必要的。只有在中国工人阶级，把新中国领导得好，建设得好，稳步地由农业国变成了工业国，然后才有可能由新民主主义转变到社会主义，工人阶级才能得到彻底的解放。这就是工人阶级的根本利益。为此目的，在现阶段自觉地，忍受资本家之一定限度以内的剥削，就是以局部的暂时的利益，服从根本的长远的利益。我们共产党员，工会工作者，必须以这样的精神来教育工人群众，领导工会工作。否则，我们就会陷入经济主义与尾巴主义的泥坑，我们就不是无产阶级的先锋队，就不能正确地组织，并领导工人群众，完成新民主主义的历史任务，而过渡到社会主义。为什么？因为，在现阶段在政治上，工人阶级要联合愿意与我们合作的自由资产阶级，共同反对帝国主义，封建主义，和官僚资本主义。在经济上，中国经济落后，中国的工业和农业，在国民经济中的比重，就全国范围来说，大约是工业占百分之十左右，农业占百分之九十左右。毛主席指示我们：“这是在中国革命的时期内，及在革命胜利以后，一个相当长的时期内，一切问题的基本出发点”。
    （二）正因为工人阶级是新民主主义国家的领导的阶级，工人阶级，不仅在政治上领导着资产阶级，而且，在经济上也经过它所领导的国家政权与国营经济来领导私人资本主义经济，使之在公私兼顾，劳资两利的原则之下，为发展生产，繁荣经济服务。我们必须限制私人资本主义，使之不能操纵国民生计，向着有益于而不是有害于国民生计的方向走，但是，另一方面，我们又必须记着毛主席的指示：“为了整个国民经济的利益，为了无产阶级和劳动人民现在和将来的利益，决不可以对私人资本主义限制得太大太死，必须容许它们在人民共和国的经济政策与经济计划的轨道内，有存在和发展的余地”。在人民共和国的经济政策和经济计划的轨道内存在和发展的，私人资本主义是当前整个国民经济中不可缺少的一部分，是一个不可忽视的力量。当做新民主主义国家之领导阶级的工人阶级，不仅应把国营经济看做是自己的财富，也应该把私人资本主义经济看做是自己所领导的国家的社会财富。
    （三）因此，工人阶级在国营企业中，应该是面对着生产，学习经营，学习管理，提高政治，提高文化。国营企业的工人是工人阶级的一部分，国营企业的行政管理干部，也是工人阶级的一部分，二者之间，完全不应该有矛盾。目前所存在的若干不协调的现象，其来源或者是由于工人中的经济主义倾向，或者是由于行政管理干部中的官僚主义倾向。公营企业中的工会，对于这两种倾向，都应该看做工会内部一部分会员的思想倾向，批评教育纠正之。国营企业的工会，由于反映了落后工人的经济主义倾向，而和行政管理干部对立起来，固然是错误的，就是为反对行政管理干部中的官僚主义倾向，而采取对立的态度，也是不正确的。另一方面行政管理干部，应当重视工会工作，尽可能支持工会工作，提高工会在工人群众中的威信，要知道，新民主主义的管理生产与官僚资本主义根本不同之点，就是官僚资本主义是依靠对工人的强制压迫，我们是依靠工人自觉，因此管理民主化与行政干部的民主作风，有特别重大的意义，必须把工会工作搞好，才更易于实现管理民主化，来动员全体职工的自觉劳动热忱提高生产。总之在国营企业中，代表国家管理生产的行政管理干部，直接从事生产劳动的工人和工会工作干部，都是工人阶级，他们的任务是一致的，就是搞好生产，这是国家的要求，也是工人阶级的要求。
    在私营企业中，是存在着两个对立的阶级，资本家和工人。工会是工人阶级的阶级组织，应该坚定不移的保卫工人阶级的利益。但是工人阶级的利益，并不等于无限制的增加工资，无限制的改善生活，如果这样，那就是经济主义者的路线。是落后工人的情绪，而不是真正工人阶级的利益。在新民主主义政权下，私人资本主义企业中的工会，也必须是教育工人，使之懂得工人阶级长远的根本的利益，而在劳资两利的原则下，发展生产，并在生产中努力学习，提高自己。当然，在私营企业中，要实现劳资两利，光靠政府的法令和监督是不够的。资本家是有种种办法，力求克扣工人，增加剥削利润的，要经过工人一定的适当的斗争，才能实现两利。在工人与资本家的这种斗争中，工会应该是坚决代表工人的。
    （四）这是不是说，工会不应该争取工人阶级生活之可能的改善与工人福利呢？不是的，党和工会首先是人民政府，必须保证工人阶级之最低生活，并争取工人阶级的生活之可能的改善。但是，工人阶级生活之改善，只有在发展生产中才有可能。现在，许多大中小城市，已经解放了，我们除了保障工人最低生活而外，一般并不能使之有多少改善（当然工人阶级的政治生活，是根本改善了，解放了，自由了）。因为，第一、旧中国的城市，特别是大城市是帝国主义殖民地经济的“繁荣”；是建筑在封建的废墟之上，搜刮农民膏血的“繁荣”，要转变成为新民主主义的城市，生产的城市，一般是要一个相当过程，而目前正处在转变的过渡时期。第二、十数年来的战争破坏，过去是革命的乡村包围反革命统治的城市，乡村封锁城市的城乡关系。现在，城市解放了，要建立新的城乡互助的城乡关系，要恢复多年来被破坏了的城乡经济纽带，也需要一个相当的过程，目前也正处在这种转变的过渡时期。由于这两大原因，目前许多新解放的城市和工业生产，恢复和维持已深感困难，发展更谈不到。许多国营企业是在国家津贴的条件下，勉强维持生产，许多企业因为生产成本过高，根本不能与外货竞争，目前是在实施某种出入口统制的条件下继续生存着。在这种情形之下，工人阶级的最低生活也是要保证的。但是，除了保证工人的最低生活，说服教育工人，艰苦斗争，渡过难关以外，如何还能提高待遇，增加工资呢？当然，有些地方，如东北，情况比较好些，工人生活也可以在可能范围内稍加改善。但是，也应注意到，某些在特殊条件下所产生的特殊利润，那并不是正常状态下的，工人劳动的剩余价值，这种特殊利润，应该以税收形式收归国家，以之支援战争，并为工业化积累资本，绝不应该做成资本家的利润，也不应该用以增加工资，改善部分工人的生活，使之过于突出。国民党官僚资本在中纺公司所实行的一套办法，使中纺工人的工资突出的高，那是收买部分工人，分化工人阶级团结的办法，我们绝不应该采取的。我们的方针，是发展生产，在发展生产的基础上，尽可能改善工人生活。事实上生产发展了，人民的财富增加了，人民的生活水平也就随之提高，工人生活也就随之提高了。以改善工人生活为发展工业生产的前提，那是倒果为因的。不注意发展生产而斤斤于改善工人生活，那是自杀的政策。
    总之，革命的终极目的就在发展生产。为着支援当前尚未结束的解放战争需要发展生产；为着建设新中国，使中国由农业国变为工业国，并进而由新民主主义转变到社会主义，更需要发展生产，特别是发展工业。发展生产，发展工业，是中国人民的要求，也是工人阶级的要求，也就是我们党的要求。
    当做工人阶级的阶级组织的工会，在新民主主义政权下，它的任务首先应该是面向着生产。在私营企业中对资本家之必要的斗争，也是为着实现劳资两利，发展生产，在国营企业中则更应该是团结全体职工，克服官僚主义完成生产任务。
    其次，工会应该成为工人阶级的一种学校，它是经营管理生产的学校，也是工人阶级实施阶级教育的学校。
    最后，工会是新民主主义政权的重要支柱，是党联系工人群众的转动带，党的工业政策，工业计划与工资政策，劳资关系的政策，都是经过工会而深入到工人群众中去，并由工人群众实现之。所以在工会中工作的同志要努力使工会成为党联系工人群众，在工业领域中，在工人群众中，实现党的政策的一个最重要的杠杆。
    今天我只讲这几点，供同志们在讨论中参考。（完）
