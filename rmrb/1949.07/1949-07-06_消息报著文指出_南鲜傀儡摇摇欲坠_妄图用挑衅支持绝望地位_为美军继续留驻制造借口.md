　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: TASS Moscow dispatch: *Izvestia*’s observer wrote on the 2nd: The position of the American puppets in South Korea is becoming increasingly hopeless. The people have risen in armed resistance. Unable to cope with the guerrilla movement, the South Korean authorities are carrying out large-scale repression of peaceful residents, carrying out massacres of entire villages. But this can only deepen the people's hatred of the American occupying forces and their running dogs. The observer commented on the current conspiracies and disintegration in Seoul, saying that the so-called ministers of the South Korean "government" are being exposed one by one for shameful acts of corruption. In early June, Ren Yongxin, the South Korean "government" Minister of Industry and Commerce, was dismissed for bribery and speculation. The struggle within the ruling clique is intensifying, and the "National Assembly" has also been drawn into the struggle. The observer then pointed out that the Seoul running dogs are trying to use provocations to support their tottering position. Recently, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reported that the so-called "Defense" forces of the South Korean puppet "government" are systematically launching attacks on North Korean residential areas along the 38th parallel according to a certain plan, looting, killing, kidnapping residents, burning houses, and taking away livestock. Li Chengwan and his masters are trying to divert the attention of the South Korean people from their difficult economic and political situation and create new excuses for the continued stationing of American troops in Korea. The observer concluded by writing that the communique of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea exposed the provocateurs in Seoul. The South Korean provocateurs and their masters are the enemies of the Korean people, and they have violated international peace.

　　消息报著文指出
  　南鲜傀儡摇摇欲坠
    妄图用挑衅支持绝望地位
  　为美军继续留驻制造借口
    【新华社北平六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报观察家二日写道：南朝鲜美国傀儡的地位愈来愈没有希望。人民已起而武装反抗。无法对付游击队运动的南朝鲜当局，正在对和平居民大肆镇压，整村整村地实行屠杀。但只能加深人民对美国占领军及其走狗的憎恨。观察家评述目前汉城的阴谋及其分崩离析称：南朝鲜“政府”的所谓部长，一个个地因可耻的舞弊行为而被揭发。六月初，南朝鲜“政府”工商部长任永信，已因受贿及从事投机活动而被撤职。统治集团内部的斗争正在加紧，“国民议会”也已卷入斗争。观察家继而指出，汉城走狗们企图用挑衅来支持他们摇摇欲坠的地位。最近，朝鲜人民民主共和国内政部报告，南朝鲜傀儡“政府”的所谓“国防”军，正在按照一定的计划有系统地向北纬三十八度沿线的北朝鲜居民区发动突击，抢劫，杀人，掳绑居民，焚毁住房，夺走牲畜。李承晚及其主子企图以此转移南朝鲜人民对其窘困的经济及政治情势的注意，并替美军继续留驻朝鲜造成新借口。观察家在结语中写道，朝鲜人民民主共和国内政部公报揭露了汉城的挑衅者。南朝鲜挑衅者和他们的主子是朝鲜人民的敌人，他们侵犯了国际安宁。
