Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 30th: Reports from various sources indicate that a fierce struggle has erupted in the US Senate during the debate over cutting foreign aid appropriations. Although the bill for the second year of US foreign aid expenses, totaling $5.43 billion, was formally passed by Congress as early as April 14th, it was cut by over $800 million on July 11th when the bill was submitted to the Senate Appropriations Committee for discussion on actual appropriations. The military budget of over $15 billion for this year was also cut by $1.01 billion on the 15th. Since July 25th, the Senate plenary session has begun debating the reduction plan passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee in a tense atmosphere. Senators, led by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Democratic Senator McKellar, believe that the foreign aid expenses are too large and will place a heavy burden on the US economy. However, senators who oppose the cuts believe that reducing foreign aid funds will paralyze the Marshall Plan. On the 26th, impatient and agitated senators engaged in a brawl amidst boos while discussing the reduction of funding for the Congressional Foreign Aid Oversight Committee. According to Agence France-Presse, Washington, July 27th, the Senate, in a state of chaos and division, has returned the foreign aid appropriation plan to the Appropriations Committee after fierce debate. The chaotic situation in the US Senate regarding the reduction of foreign aid appropriations reflects the deepening divisions within the US ruling bloc as the Marshall Plan suffers setbacks.

　　马歇尔计划遭受失败
    美帝内部摩擦益烈
  　为削减“援外”拨款吵打
    【新华社北平三十日电】各方报道，美国参院在辩论削减援外拨款中发生激烈的斗争。美国第二年度援外费用五十四亿三千万元的法案，虽早在四月十四日即经国会正式通过，但当该案交到参院拨款委员会讨论实际拨款时，却于七月十一日被削减了八亿余元。本年度一百五十余亿元的军事预算，也于十五日被削减了十亿一千万元。自七月二十五日起，参院全体会议在紧张的气氛中开始辩论参院拨款委员会通过的削减方案。以拨款委员会主席、民主党参议员麦克凯勒为首的参议员们，认为援外费用过大，将予美国经济以沉重的负担。但反对削减的参议员们则认为削减援外经费，将使马歇尔计划陷于瘫痪。二十六日，暴躁、激动的参议员们，在讨论到削减国会援外监督委员会的经费时，于嘘嘘声中发生了一场扭打。据法新社华盛顿二十七日电，陷于混乱与分裂中的参院在激烈争论后，已将援外拨款计划送回拨款委员会。美国参院在削减援外拨款问题上所发生的混乱情况，反映了在马歇尔计划遭受失败之下，美国统治集团内部分歧的加深。
