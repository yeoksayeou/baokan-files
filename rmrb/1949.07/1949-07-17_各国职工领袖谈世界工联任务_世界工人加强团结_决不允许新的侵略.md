Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: Reports from various sources: Trade union leaders from various countries attending the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions have recently issued statements discussing the great achievements of the Congress and the future tasks of the working class of each country.

    Vittorio, General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, stated: The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions has demonstrated that the WFTU is a tremendous force. The Geneva meeting held by the splitters was, as even the New York Herald Tribune had to admit, an insignificant farce. Although the American and British trade union leaders betrayed the international trade union movement, the WFTU still reserves seats for the true representatives of the workers in the United States and Britain.

    Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, emphasized: The struggle to win the unity of workers and trade unions is a decisive condition for victory in the struggle against imperialist war-mongers and for peace. If, before the Second World War, the working class of the whole world had opposed the fascist aggressors in an organized way, then the Second World War could have been avoided. However, as a result of the divisive policies of the previous leaders of the Amsterdam International, it was not possible to oppose fascism in an organized way. Now, the working class of the whole world must not and will not allow new aggression against humanity.

    Frachon, General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, declared: The Milan Congress once again confirmed the true international nature of the WFTU. The working people of the United States, Britain, Sweden, and Norway, after experiencing painful tests, will come to the inescapable conclusion that the working class must unite, and they will return to the great family of the WFTU.

    Wickremasinghe, a leader of the Indian Trade Union, stated: The Milan Congress placed the colonial issue at the forefront of its work. Despite the implementation of terror and suppression by American and British imperialism and their running dogs, the colonial workers' movement is drawing lessons from the great victories of the Soviet Union and People's China and is growing stronger day by day.

    Wancke, First Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation in the Soviet Zone of Germany, stated: The German trade union delegation is particularly grateful for the friendly and affectionate attitude of the Congress towards it. Our task is to win over the working masses of West Germany to participate in the struggle against the Marshall Plan and its consequences, against mass layoffs and wage reductions, and against turning West Germany into a base for anti-Soviet war. We will resolutely fulfill our great task.

    Brouwer, Chairman of the Netherlands Unified Trade Union Federation, stated: The task of the Netherlands Unified Trade Union Federation is to liberate the masses of trade union members from the influence of the splitters like Kupers and to restore the unity of the trade union movement.

    各国职工领袖谈世界工联任务
    世界工人加强团结
    决不允许新的侵略
    【新华社北平十六日电】各方报道：出席世界工联第二次代表大会的各国职工会领袖，近日分别发表谈话，论述大会的伟大成就及各国工人阶级今后的任务。
    意大利总工会总书记维特里奥称：世界工联第二届代表大会，已经显示世界工联是一个巨大的力量。分裂分子所举行的日内瓦会议，连纽约先驱论坛报也  不得不承认是一幕无足轻重的滑稽剧。虽然美英职工会领袖背叛了国际职工会运动，但世界工联仍然给美英两国工人的真正代表，保留着席位。
    苏联职工会中央理事会主席库兹涅佐夫强调指出：争取工人和职工会团结的斗争，是反对帝国主义战争贩子、争取和平之斗争取得胜利的一个决定性的条件。如果第二次世界大战之前，全世界工人阶级以有组织的方式来反对法西斯侵略者，那么，第二次大战是可以避免的。但是，由于先前阿姆斯特丹国际领袖们分裂政策的结果，便不能以有组织的方式去反对法西斯主义。现在，全世界的工人阶级决不能而且也决不允许对人类进行新的侵略。
    法国总工会总书记佛拉商声称：米兰大会再一次证实了世界工联真正的国际性质。美国、英国、瑞典和挪威的劳动人民，在经历了痛苦的考验之后，将得出无可逃避的结论，即工人阶级必需团结，他们将回到世界工联的伟大家庭中来。
    印度职工会领袖魏克拉马辛称：米兰大会把殖民地问题放在大会工作的首要地位。尽管美英帝国主义及其走狗们施行恐怖镇压，但是殖民地的工人运动，正从苏联与人民中国的伟大胜利中吸取经验教训，而正在日渐壮大中。
    德境苏占区自由德国职工会联合会第一主席汪克称：德国职工会代表团特别感激大会对它的友好亲爱的态度。我们的任务，是争取西德的劳动群众参加斗争，反对马歇尔计划及其后果，反对大批解雇和减少工资，反对把西德变成反苏战争的基地。我们将坚决地完成我们的巨大任务。
    荷兰统一工会联合会主席布洛兹尔称：荷兰统一工会联合会的任务，是把职工会的群众从库伯斯之流的分裂者的影响之下解放出来，并恢复职工会运动的统一。
