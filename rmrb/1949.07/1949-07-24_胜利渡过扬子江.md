Successfully Crossing the Yangtze River
    A Collective Creation by Representatives of the Second Field Army at the Literary Congress, written by Zeng Ke and Hu Qi
    (A Four-Act Play)
    Time: April 1949.
    Location: A ferry crossing on the north bank of the Yangtze River, east of Anqing.
    Characters:
    Shi Quanyi: Squad Leader of the 6th Squad, × Company.
    Wang Zhiwu: Deputy Squad Leader.
    Li Fugui: Soldier.
    Zhang Shuanglin: Soldier. Nicknamed "Landlubber."
    Yang Hu: A simple and honest young soldier.
    Lao Wu: Soldier.
    Xiao Lin: Soldier.
    Cheng Baihe: An old boatman.
    Cheng Wanli: His son.
    Sister-in-law Shen: A female boat hand.
    Mao@ (sounds like "a," meaning child): Sister-in-law Shen's son, eleven years old.
    Grandma Gu: Sister-in-law Shen's neighbor, over sixty years old.
    A squad of soldiers carrying guns.
    A propagandist wearing red.
    A soldier carrying a red flag.
    Act One: Scene Opens:
    Night. After 12 o'clock, with a slight moonlight. On the silent river embankment, soldiers Lao Wu and Yang Hu are patrolling back and forth with their guns, monitoring the river surface. Below the river embankment, Deputy Squad Leader Wang Zhiwu is leading soldiers Li Fugui, Zhang Shuanglin, and Xiao Lin in digging fortifications.
    Wang Zhiwu (hereafter referred to as Wang, popping his head out of the fortifications): Comrades, let's take a break. Samsung is due south, it's the middle of the night.
    Li Fugui (hereafter referred to as Li): Deputy Squad Leader, where's the pipe?
    Lao Wu (hereafter referred to as Wu): Li Fugui, you have to choose a place to smoke. The enemy is just across the river. Exposing the target could get you hurt.
    Li: You're so timid. There's an embankment here, and the enemy doesn't have binoculars. How could they see us? Deputy Squad Leader, just give me the pipe.
    Wang: You still have to be careful. The enemy over there sometimes fires shells randomly over here, doesn't he? These days, they're guessing we're going to cross the river, and they've brought out the "water tigers" that their American fathers sent them.
    Zhang Shuanglin (hereafter referred to as Zhang): What are "water tigers," Deputy Squad Leader?
    Wang: It's the warships that come here to show off every night these days. They make a fierce "moo moo" sound. But that won't scare us!
    Li: Deputy Squad Leader, you can't say that. Warships are not to be underestimated. If we had dozens of these, wouldn't we be across the Yangtze with a "whoosh"? Why are we doing this the hard way?
    Wang: We can always deal with warships. Last night, as soon as it showed its head, our anti-aircraft artillery fired a shell right into its rear end. It emitted a puff of white smoke and disappeared.
    Zhang: Ah, what I'm worried about now is, what are we going to use to cross? (Stands up, pointing to the Yangtze River.) Look, this is the narrowest part of the Yangtze, and it's still four or five li wide. The water flows with a rushing sound. Who doesn't know that even when it's calm it has three-foot waves? It's deep, too deep to touch the bottom! The river porpoises arching up and down – without a good method and sturdy boats, it won't be easy to cross.
    Yang Hu (hereafter referred to as Yang): You guys are really worrying about nothing. If the higher-ups aren't prepared, they wouldn't just make you cross. We crossed the Yellow River, fought at Yangshan, climbed snow-capped mountains and crossed icy rivers in the Dabie Mountains, plus captured Huang Wei in the Huaihai Campaign. Isn't that much harder?
    Wu (interrupting Yang): Don't be so fearless. Come and look. Aren't those river porpoises arching up? Look how big those two black ears are. Just one flap of those could overturn a boat, let alone that big sharp snout.
    (Silence)
    (Xiao Lin and Zhang Shuanglin also crowd over to look.)
    (The wind howls, and the sound of the river water gently lapping against the riverbank.)
    Zhang: Hey, where'd the river porpoises go? I can't see them anymore.
    Yang: You guys are really seeing ghosts in broad daylight, scaring yourselves. Today, I was chatting with our landlord, Sister-in-law Shen. She said river porpoises are nothing. As long as you don't provoke them, they won't provoke you. Hearing is false, seeing is believing. I think the Yangtze River is just like that!
    Wu: Then...
    Yang: Go away! Just stand your post!
    Wang: Comrades, let's dig these firing positions well. When the squad leader comes back from the company meeting, he might have new tasks for us. (Everyone continues digging fortifications.)
    Li (working while talking to himself): Today is already the end of March. Half a month will pass in the blink of an eye. I wonder how many boats our regiment has managed to get. If we don't even have a steamboat or warship, I think it's a bit...
    Wang: Li Fugui, why do you keep talking about warships and steamboats? That's your old Kuomintang thinking. Even without these things, we can guarantee crossing the Yangtze River. The company commander and political instructor tell us every day to use our brains. Whoever has a good idea should bring it out. For example, you. You're a Southerner, you know how to swim. When they registered sailors yesterday, you refused. If everyone was like you, the difficulties would be even greater.
    Zhang (to Li): That's right. If I were you, I wouldn't be worrying. What's most difficult for me now is that I can't swim. I only came to the Dabie Mountains the year before last. When I saw a duck, I thought a chicken had fallen into the water!
    Lin: Ha, you mountain people are really landlubbers.
    All (laughing): Good, good, that's a great nickname!
    Zhang: Xiao Lin, don't make fun of me!
    Wu: Comrades, be careful. Listen, what's that? (The sound of enemy warships draining water and the roar of engines comes from the distance.)
    Yang: Deputy Squad Leader, the water tiger is here! Let's take down those bastards!
    Wang: Don't rush, let's hide ourselves first!
    (Everyone quiets down. All take cover.)
    (The sound of the warship comes from far to near, and then from near to far.)
    (A cannon fires.)
    Yang: Good, that's a clean shot, one more time.
    Wu: Don't talk.
    (Listening)
    Yang: What are you afraid of? Hey, another shot.
    (Then a burst of artillery fire rings out.)
    All: Great, great! Good!
    (Silence.)
    Yang (coming out of the fortifications): It's dead.
    Wu: The water tiger must have been sunk by our anti-aircraft artillery.
    Zhang: Sunk?
    Yang: Listen, there's no sound anymore.
    Zhang: Good, our anti-aircraft artillery is really powerful.
    Yang: Of course it's powerful. Otherwise, how would they get on our regimental newspaper?
    Zhang: Anti-aircraft artillery is also on the newspaper?
    Li: It's been on for a while, landlubber. You want to know? If you want to know, ask (pointing to Lin) our squad's quick-patter expert to read it to you!
    Zhang: You call me landlubber again, I won't stand for it. (To Lin) Xiao Lin, will you read me about the anti-aircraft artillery?
    Lin (Ignoring him, working.)
    Zhang: Xiao Lin!
    Lin: What?
    Zhang: Read me about the anti-aircraft artillery.
    Lin (recites quick-patter): You're really something, your eyes are on top of your head, I'm working here, and you're jabbering away. (Continues to dig fortifications)
    Wang: Xiao Lin, my firing position is dug, come on, I'll dig yours, you just tell me a story.
    Lin (puts down tools, pulls out newspaper): Right, tell a story, tell a story, telling stories is fun. Pull out a newspaper, everything's black, no lights, no fire. (White) With no lights, I won't say it.
    Wang: You little devil, you're really hard to please. If there's no fire, then hum it. Hum as much as you can.
    Lin: Okay, I'll hum it, you listen (finds two tiles as clappers and sings).
    Anti-aircraft artillery, made in America, I know your history, great victory in the Huaihai Campaign, I liberated you. Wipe you down three times a day, and apply grease to you, don't let the sun shine, don't let the heavy rain pour, when the wind blows and snow falls, take off my cotton-padded coat to wrap you. Why love you so much, just hoping to cross the Yangtze River and make great contributions to the people.
    Shi Quanyi (enters, hereafter referred to as Shi): Deputy Squad Leader, are the fortifications almost done?!
    Wang: You came at the right time, there's only this one gun hole left.
    Shi: That's good, the company meeting today is to give us new tasks.
    All: What task? Is the day of crossing the Yangtze coming sooner?
    Shi: No, the higher-ups want us to prepare well again.
    Yang (hurrying over from the embankment): The more we prepare, the more the enemy prepares. It's better to cross sooner.
    Li: What are you going to cross with? Fly across with wings? We don't even have a decent wooden boat!
    Yang: Boats don't have legs, they can't run here themselves. You're always talking nonsense. Even if you prepare until the New Year, you won't be ready.
    Wang: Alright, alright, don't argue. Let the squad leader tell us about the meeting.
    Shi (to Yang): It's not okay to just worry without being prepared. (To Li) It's not okay to just talk about difficulties without taking action. This was brought up at the company meeting today. Ideas like yours have to be eliminated quickly. Tomorrow morning, everyone will start mobilizing the people to find boats. Those who signed up to be sailors last time will lead everyone in practice tomorrow. Those who haven't signed up need to sign up quickly. The Party Committee has called on us. Whoever prepares first will be given the shock task. We've requested it several times, and we have to sweat a few more drops to get glory!
    Yang: Squad Leader, I didn't mean what I said just now, that was my strange thinking messing around. You can't lose the whole squad's glory because of me. Squad Leader, I'll listen to you. Whatever the higher-ups tell us to do, I'll be the first to do it.
    Zhang: Li Fugui, did you hear that? What else do you have to say?
    Li: Just do it, it won't be difficult for you landlubber, and it won't be difficult for me.
    Shi: That's right, as long as our whole squad works together, we can definitely get the shock troop mission.
    Yang (suddenly discovers something, pulls back the bolt, and shouts): Who's there? Don't move!
    All: What's wrong?
    Wu: S...someone has climbed up to the embankment.
    All (all weapons are locked and loaded): Who?
    Shi: Stay calm, see clearly, everyone get into the fortifications!
    Wu (holding the gun, forces forward): What are you doing? I'll shoot if you don't speak.
    An old man's weak voice: Old General, Old General, don't shoot.
    Yang: Stop, stop, don't move.
    The old man's voice: I, I am a civilian, running away from across the river.
    Yang: Bullshit, you must be an enemy spy. Beat you to death (cocks the gun).
    Shi (pulls Yang back): Take it easy, someone go down and take a look!
    Zhang: I'll go! (To the bottom of the embankment) Don't move, raise your hands.
    (After a short pause, Zhang leads up an old man drenched to the skin.)
    Yang (can't resist, grabs the old man's collar): Say, who sent you?
    Old Man: Old General, I am a good civilian!
    All: A good civilian, why did you cross the river in the middle of the night? Tell the truth, or you'll lose your life!
    Old Man (as if about to kneel): Old General, I really am a good civilian. Last year, when Liu Ruming retreated to the other side of the river, he tied up countless of us riverbank people with our boats. We were beaten and starved, it was unbearable. That's why I crossed the river in the middle of the night, trying to run back!
    Yang: Don't talk nonsense. The enemy would just let you run back?
    Old Man: Old General, we can't live over there on the other side of the river either, I just looked for a chance to run for my life. If I get out, I save my life, if I don't, it's still better than suffering! (Takes off his clothes, pointing to his scars.) Look, they forced me to cross the river to probe for your news, I refused, and they used a rope to hoist me up to the mast, my hands tied behind my back, for a whole day. These...these are the marks from the ropes. If I tell a lie, just give me a bullet.
    Shi: Stand up and speak, where are you from?
    Cheng: I'm from this area, I'm surnamed Cheng, from the edge of Shitou Lake in front, I've lived here for generations.
    Yang: Who can vouch for you?
    Cheng: Old General, if you don't believe me, find any adult or child, they all know me. I'm Cheng Baihe, my son is called Cheng Wanli, my son and I are both boatmen.
    Yang: That's right, then let's go find them.
    Shi: Deputy Squad Leader, then take them with you.
    Yang: Let's go, let's see what kind of bad thing you are.
    —Curtain—
    Act Two:
    The next morning, in front of Sister-in-law Shen's thatched cottage. In front of the house is a low fence, an earthen slope, and behind the slope is the glittering, dazzling Shitou Lake.
    As the scene opens, Sister-in-law Shen carries a bundle of bamboo as thick as a bowl out of the house and stops at the door of the thatched cottage and suddenly turns around.
    Shen (to herself): Huh, why is no one in the house? (Towards the low fence) Mao@, Mao@!
    Mao: Yes!
    Shen: Where did the comrades of the Sixth Squad go?
    Mao (running in from outside): Mom, they've all gone. Deputy Squad Leader Wang said they went out to find boats. They said they need to find twenty boats today!
    Shen: Alas, these young people are so pitiful. They've been digging fortifications for several nights in a row. They only came back when the roosters crowed last night, and they haven't even had a wink of sleep before they went out again.
    Mao: Mom, Grandpa Cheng from the west bank of Shitou Lake sneaked back from Jiangnan.
    Shen: Ah, the old man is back. Did you see him? Did he see your dad?
    Mao: Everyone on the street is talking about it. Mom, I'll go take a look.
    Shen: Go quickly, and find out how your dad is doing over there.
    Mao: Okay, then I'll go.
    (A noisy quarrel comes from the next courtyard.)
    Mao: Grandma Gu from the next courtyard is arguing with someone again.
    Shen: Alas, that old grandma is so narrow-minded. She's always scolding people all day long.
    (The quarrel gets louder and louder, and you can hear an old woman crying out loud: "Comrade, would I deceive you? There really isn't a boat in my house. Who told you that? Who told you that?")
    A soldier's voice: "Sister-in-law Shen in the next courtyard knows. What are you hiding?")
    (The old woman's voice: "Then I'll go ask her, then I'll go ask her.")
    (Grandma Gu enters, shouting and gesticulating, stumbling.)
    (Deputy Squad Leader Wang Zhiwu leads Li Fugui on.)
    Gu: Sister-in-law Shen, you're really trying to frame me. What ghost told you that my family has a boat? Have you ever seen it? Have you ever seen it?
    Shen: Grandma Gu, what's wrong? Sit down and talk slowly!
    Gu: Has a boat, has a boat, didn't Liu Ruming take all the big and small boats from our riverside house by house when he retreated to the other side of the river last year? Don't you know that?
    Wang: Grandma Gu, take your time, if you really don't have one, we can't force you.
    Shen: Yes, the Liberation Army comrades have lived here for almost half a year. Don't you know how they treat the people? If there's anything we can help you with, would we need the comrades to waste their breath?
    Gu: Help where you can. My arms are short, my sleeves are short, I don't have a good way.
    Li (rushes up): Just lend us your boat.
    Gu: Alas, you're really praying at the wrong temple, a mosquito biting the Buddha, biting the wrong person. You don't look for people who have boats, but you come to me instead.
    Shen: Grandma, you can't say that. Whoever helps shows their heart to the Liberation Army. My broken boat has been used for generations and it's falling apart. I was planning to repair it for the comrades to use. If you take it out, it'll be written in your account, don't be confused.
    Gu: Sister-in-law Shen, your words are all good, if my small fishing boat was at hand, would I be angry with the comrades? I would have given it to them long ago.
    Mao: The boat isn't at hand?
    Gu: That's right!
    Mao: (mimicking) That's right. Yesterday I saw your nephew use it to fish under the Big Stone Bridge.
    Gu: That's right, he rowed it to Zongyang Town to sell fish, who knows when he'll bring it back.
    Wang: Grandma Gu, as long as you agree to let us use it, we can wait a little longer, or we can send someone to Zongyang to find it.
    Gu (helplessly to herself): Without oars and rudder, see what use you can make of it.
    Li: You old woman, you really.
    Wang: Grandma, don't worry. We'll replace anything that's missing, and if it's damaged, we'll make a new one for you.
    Gu: Replacing it or not, we're all one family, saying that doesn't help. I'm just suffering, an old woman with no tiles above my head and no land beneath my feet, with no children to rely on, I depend on my nephew to support me with that small fishing boat.
    Wang: Grandma, we know your difficulties. We're crossing the Yangtze River to let you live a good life as soon as possible. We'll give you grain for every day we borrow your boat. If your nephew can come along, I'll give him a water service certificate, and the public will take care of his food and drink. It's a lifetime of glory!
    Mao: There are so many good things? Mom, let's take that small boat and send the comrades across the river.
    Li: We don't need your wife and children, we just need you to clean up the boat and make it tidy.
    Shen: Comrades, I've been married to a boat since I was seventeen or eighteen, and I've raised children for almost thirty years. No matter how big the wind or how high the waves on the Yangtze River, I've never been scared. If you need me, I can help the Liberation Army.
    Li: This isn't like fishing on the river, this is sitting on a boat under real guns and cannons!
    Shen: Comrade, I may not know how to fight, but as long as you dare to fight across, I dare to row the boat across.
    Wang: Lao Li, look at this woman! I asked you to be a sailor, and you didn't sign up.
    Li: Okay, if there are more women like this, what are we afraid of!
    Wang: Grandma, what do you say? Will you lend us the boat?
    Gu: Okay, if you need the boat, ask someone to bring it back tomorrow, but just one thing, my nephew is young and hasn't seen the world, he can't go with you!
    Wang: Okay!
    Shen: Deputy Squad Leader, how many boats are you short? Have you found any leads?
    Wang: We're still far short. Sister-in-law Shen, who else has boats in this area?
    Shen: Yes, there are many boats, but the enemy forced them all to sink into the lake. It's easy to find them. Most of them are in the shallow water on the west bank of the lake. If you see bubbles rising in the lake, there are boats underneath.
    Wang: Ah, is that how it is? That makes it easier.
    Shen: I can go with you to find them, even Mao@ can see them. (Yang Hu and Zhang Shuanglin enter).
    Yang: Damn it, it's discouraging. I've run my legs off, and I can't even find a boat hair.
    Zhang: You're good, show your attitude to the people again!
    Yang: Like you, you can't squeeze a fart out of a stick. Where's the boat the people gave you?
    Wang: What's wrong with you two? How's the boat mobilization going?
    Yang: Deputy Squad Leader, I have a suggestion. Stop being a beggar and suffering. Let's just use a few washbasins to cross. Everyone has those.
    Li: Ran into a wall, huh? You must not have found any. Look at you, we're going to let your group ruin our Sixth Squad's plan.
    Yang: Don't brag, show me one you found.
    Li: See, isn't this it? Sister-in-law Shen, Grandma Gu, one for each person.
    Zhang: Let's go, Lao Yang, let's go find it again. Don't complain about heaven, don't complain about earth, just blame ourselves for not being capable.
    Yang: You're capable, then show it. Let's go!
    Wang: You two stop. I think you should review your mobilization methods. This is a new area, and the people don't understand us. No matter what you do, you have to explain it well. Like this old grandma, she obviously has a boat at home, but we didn't explain it well at first, so it took a lot of effort.
    Shen: Deputy Squad Leader, the people here are just not open-minded. They're scared by the bandit army. If you explain some things to them, it's still easy to handle.
    Gu: I'm just confused, I'm just confused, comrades, don't hold it against me.
    Voice outside the door: Sister-in-law Shen, Sister-in-law Shen?
    Shen: Yes, it's Grandpa Cheng, come in and sit down.
    (Cheng Baihe leads his son Cheng Wanli on).
    Cheng (seeing Wang): Oh, Deputy Squad Leader Wang, you live here!
    Wang: Yes, we're here.
    Shen: Grandpa Cheng, please sit down.
    Gu (simultaneously): Old man, you're still alive, I was so worried about you.
    Li: What, do you all know each other?
    Shen: They're all old neighbors in the neighborhood. (To Cheng) I was going to ask Xiao Mao@ to find you when I heard you came back. (Pauses) You came back alone?
    Cheng: Alone.
    Shen: Where's your boat?
    Cheng: It's still on the other side of the river.
    Shen: Grandpa Cheng, is Mao@'s father alright?
    Cheng: Alas, Sister-in-law Shen, don't mention it. The damned people who dragged him across the river, how could he be alright? You can imagine it with your eyes closed, why do you need to ask in detail!
    Shen: Grandpa Cheng, what exactly happened? You have to tell me properly.
    Cheng: Saying it or not is the same. (Lifts up his clothes.) Look at these bloody welts on my body.
    Shen: What, Mao@'s father was beaten too?
    Cheng: Alas, the old dog Chiang Kai-shek is definitely doomed. He simply doesn't treat people like human beings. I've lived for fifty or sixty years, and it's the first time I've seen this.
    Shen: Grandpa Cheng, was Mao@'s father beaten badly?
    Cheng: Alas!
    Shen: Tell me!
    Cheng Wanli: Sister-in-law Shen, don't be anxious when I tell you. My dad said that Brother Shen over there was beaten so badly by those bad guys that he was vomiting blood, and now he can't even stand up.
    Shen: Really? (Anxiously) My God, why don't you open your eyes and look? This, what should I do?
    Gu (sympathetically): Tsk, tsk, those wicked people, beating a lively Brother Shen until he's vomiting blood. Alas, that's really creating sin!
    Shen (crying): Mao@'s father, Mao@'s father, he's suffered all his life, he's never cheated anyone, he's never harmed anyone, I never thought he'd end up like this.
    Cheng: Sister-in-law Shen, don't be sad. Now we don't look to heaven, we don't look to earth, we just hope that the Liberation Army crosses the river sooner. You haven't seen the lives of the people in Jiangnan. Now every family is crying and howling, harmed so badly that they can't even lift their heads.
    Wang: Sister-in-law Shen, don't worry, we will definitely avenge you.
    Shen: Deputy Squad Leader, tell me, when will you cross the river?
    Wang: This.
    Shen: Tell me, tell me?
    Wang: I don't know when we'll cross, we're not ready yet anyway.
    Shen: Deputy Squad Leader, comrades, you haven't found a boat, my son and I will help you find it. You haven't made the life rafts, I'll find bamboo for you to make them. You can't swim, I'll teach you. I only ask one thing of the comrades, if you can cross the river sooner, you can save the lives of more people sooner.
    Cheng: That's right, you must cross sooner, don't delay. The people of Jiangnan are thinking of you, hoping for you so much that they're going crazy. Comrade, I heard you're looking for sailors? I've been rowing boats on the river for forty or fifty years, I can use the eight winds. I'll sign up with my son, willing to send the comrades across the Yangtze River, do you think that will work?
    Wang: That's great! Old man, you're getting older, and you've suffered a lot on the other side of the river, you should rest more at home. We're very happy to have your son come.
    Cheng: Comrade, I'm a person who can't sit still. When I came back yesterday, everyone at home said the comrades are good, wholeheartedly serving the people, the family said the comrades use a basin of water, they fill a whole tank, there's nothing better. This time, you'll definitely need me to cross the Yangtze River, I'll definitely do my best, ha, this is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
    Wang: Old man, you should rest, it's good enough to have your son.
    Cheng: Comrades. You can rest assured, I will send the comrades across, I guarantee there won't be any trouble. With me, there'll be you.
    Wang: Your wounds haven't healed yet.
    Cheng: Hey, this little wound, it's nothing. Comrade, promise me, let me send you across, I guarantee there won't be any trouble.
    Li: Old man, you can really row a boat, don't just talk.
    Cheng: With this bristly beard, would I lie to you young people?
    Li: Okay, if you're really good, can you jump into Shitou Lake and swim around and come back!
    Cheng: Okay, you watch. (Takes off his clothes and walks towards the embankment.)
    Wang: Old man, don't!
    Cheng: Comrades, watch closely! (With a "thump" sound, he jumps down.)
    Wang: Old man, Old man, you can't do this! (To Li) Li Fugui, look at you.
    Cheng Wanli: (To Wang) Comrade, it's okay, my dad is a pro in the water.
    Li: Deputy Squad Leader, come on, I'll accompany this old man for a swim in the lake, and then you can register me, I want to be a sailor too. (Takes off his clothes and jumps into the lake.)
    Zhang: Li Fugui, be careful!
    Li's voice: It's okay, landlubber. (Loud laughter) Haha, Old man, wait for me, let's have a race!
    Cheng's voice: Come on, young man!

    第一场：幕开：
    夜晚。十二时以后，微微有些月色。在寂静的江堤上，战士老吴与杨虎抱着枪在来回巡逻，监视着江面。江堤的下边，副班长王治五带领战士李富贵、张双林、小林正在挖工事。
    王治五（以后简称王，从工事里冒出头来）：同志们，歇歇吧，三星正南，天已经半夜了。
    李富贵（以后简称李）：副班长，烟袋呢？
    老吴（以后简称吴）：李富贵，抽烟得拣个地方，敌人就在江对面，暴露了目标，小心吃家伙。
    李：瞧你胆小的，隔着个土堤，敌人又没隔山镜，他就能看见了。副班长，还是把烟袋给我吧。
    王：你还是小心些好，江那边敌人有时不是朝这边乱吊炮吗？这两天他们约摸着我们要过江，把他美国老子送来的水老虎也调出来了。
    张双林（以后简称张）：什么叫水老虎？副班长？
    王：就是这两天每天晚上要来这里耍威风的军舰，听他“哞哞”叫的怪厉害，那还能吓住咱们啦？
    李：副班长，你不能这样说，军舰这玩意儿，可不能小看，我们要是有几十只这，说声过长江，不是“呼”的一声就过去了。还叫我们做这个难？
    王：军舰那东西，我们总能对付它，昨晚上它刚一冒头，叫咱们战防炮一颗炮弹，揍到屁股上，冒了一股白烟，就再也看不见了。
    张：唉，我现在发愁的，咱们到底拿啥东西过？（站起来，指着长江。）看，这是长江最狭的地方，都有四五里地宽，水流得哗哗响，谁不知道无风三尺浪？深噢，摸也摸不到底！江猪一弓一弓的，要是没有好把式，没有结实的船，可不容易过得去。
    杨虎（以后简称杨）：你们真是咸吃萝＠淡操心，上级不准备好，总不能叫你硬过。我们过黄河，打羊山，在大别山爬雪山过冰河，加上淮海战役捉黄维，不比这困难得多？
    吴（抢白杨）：不怕，你快来看，那不是江猪弓上来了。看，那两个黑耳朵有多大，光它一忽扇，就把船扇翻了，不用说它那大尖嘴了。
    （静场）
    （小林与张双林也凑过去看。）
    （风呜呜呜着，江水轻轻拍打着江岸的声音）
    张：咦，江猪泥，怎么看不见啦？
    杨：你们真是白天见鬼，自己吓自己，今天我跟咱房东沈大嫂拉呱（扯闲话），她说江猪没什么，只要你不惹他，他也不来惹你，啥事都耳听是虚，眼见是实，我看这长江就是那么回事！
    吴：那……
    杨：去球吧；还是好好站你的岗吧！
    王：同志们，我们把这几个枪眼掏好，一会班长从连上开会回来，说不定还有新任务呢。（大家继续挖工事。）
    李（一面工作，一面自言自语的）：今天已经三月底，半个月时间一霎眼就到，我们全团不知道弄到几只船了。要是连个汽船军舰也没有，我看有点……
    王：李富贵，你怎么开口兵舰，闭口汽船，还是你那一套国民党思想，没有这些东西，咱们也保证打过长江去。连长指导员不是天天给我们说，叫大家都动脑筋，谁有啥好办法就拿出来，比方说你吧，你是南方人，懂水性，昨天登记水手的时候，你就不啃，大家都象你这个样子，那困难就更多了。
    张（对李）：对嘛，我要是你早就不发愁了。我这会最为难的，就是自己不会水，前年才到大别山，看见鸭子，我还以为鸡掉到水里呢！
    林：哈，你们山里，真是旱鸭子。
    众（笑）：好，好，这个外号起得妙！
    张：小林，你尽拿老子开心！
    吴：同志们，小心些，听，这是什么？（远处敌军舰排水声、马达声轰轰传过来。）
    杨：副班长，水老虎来了，揍狗日的吧！？
    王：别忙，还是隐蔽好！
    （大家静了下来。都进入隐蔽。）
    （军舰声自远而近，又由近而远。）
    （一声炮响。）
    杨：好，脆得很，再来一下。
    吴：别说话。
    （听）
    杨：怕什么？喝，又是一炮。
    （接着一阵排炮轰轰响起来。）
    众：痛快，痛快！好！
    （寂静。）
    杨（从工事里走出来）：断了气了。
    吴：水老虎一定叫咱们战防炮打沉了。
    张：打沉了？
    杨：你听啊，什么听音也没有了。
    张：好，咱们战防炮就是厉害。
    杨：当然厉害了。要不，他们怎么登到咱团报上呢？
    张：战防炮也登到报上了？
    李：早登上了，旱鸭子，你想知道不？想知道就叫（指林）咱班上快板专家给您念一念！
    张：你又是旱鸭子，下次再叫，我可不依。（向林）小林，你给我念念战防炮好不好？
    林（不理，正在进行自己工作。）
    张：小林！
    林：干什么？
    张：给我念念战防炮吧。
    林（念快板）：你这人，真是行，眼睛长到脑门顶，我在这里有工作，你偏叽哩瓜啦吵不清。（继续挖工事）
    王：小林，我的枪眼挖好了，来，我给你挖，你就给我讲一讲说一说吧。
    林（放下工具，掏出报纸）：对，讲一讲，说一说，讲讲说说挺快乐，掏出报纸一片黑，四周没灯也没火。（白）没灯没亮的，我不说了。
    王：你这小鬼，真是难侍候呢，没火你就＠吧，能＠多少就多少。
    林：对，那我就＠，你听着（找了两块瓦片当鼓板敲着唱起来）。
    战防炮，美国造，你的来历我知道，淮海战役大胜利，我把你解放了。一天把你擦三遍，还要给你涂油膏，不让太阳晒，不让大雨浇，刮风下大雪，自己脱下棉袄把你包。这样爱你为何故，就是指望渡过长江为人民立下大功劳。
    史全义（上，以下简称史）：副班长。工事挖得差不多啦吧！？
    王：你来得正好，就只剩这么一个枪洞了。
    史：那好么，今天连上开会，就是要给我们新任务了。
    众：什么任务，是不是过长江的日子提前了？
    史：不是，上级要我们再好好准备一下。
    杨（从堤上揍拢过来）：咱们多准备一天，敌人也就多准备一天，还不是一样。倒不如早一天过了算了。
    李：你拿什么过？插翅膀飞过去，连一只象样的木船还没有咧！
    杨：船又没有长腿，它还能自己跑来，你一天到晚二话连篇，准备到过年也准备不好。
    王：好了，好了，不要抬杠了，快点让班长把开会的情形告诉我们吧。
    史（对杨）：不准备妥当，光着急，可不行，（对李）光讲困难不动手也不行。今天连上开会提出来了。象你们这种想法，都得赶快消灭消灭。明天一清早，大家就动手亲自动员老百姓找船，上次报名参加水手的，明天就带大家练，没有报名的，得快些报名，党委会号召我们了，谁先准备好，突击任务就交给他，咱们不是请求了好几次了，光荣还得多出几把汗，才能取到手哩！
    杨：班长，我刚才说的都不算数，那是我的怪思想在捣乱，可不能因为我把全班光荣丢了。班长，听你的，上级叫咱怎么干，我算头一份。
    张：李富贵，听见了，吧，你还有啥意见？
    李：干就干＠，难为不住你这只旱鸭子，就难为不住我。
    史：对了，只要我们全班一股劲，突击队任务一定能当上。
    杨（突然发现了什么，拉开枪栓，惊叫。）哪个，不许动！
    众：怎么啦？
    吴：有……有人爬到堤上来了。
    众（都上了顶膛火）：谁？
    史：沉住气，看清楚，大家快到工事里去！
    吴（端着枪，逼上前去）：干什么的，不说话就开枪了。
    一个老年人微弱声音：老总，老总，别开枪。
    杨：站住，站住，不许动。
    老人的声音：我，我是老百姓啊，从江那边逃过来的。
    杨：扯球蛋，一定是敌人的探子。揍死你（把枪拉得哗哗响。）
    史（拉住杨）：慢点来，下去一个人看看！
    张：我去！（对堤底）不要动，举起手来。
    （少停，张带着一个混身湿透了的老人走上来。）
    杨（耐不住，一把拧住老人的衣领）：你说，什么人派你来的。
    老人：老总，我是好老百姓啊！
    众：好老百姓，半夜三更你怎么过江来的？说实话，小心你老命！
    老人（象要跪下的样子）：老总，我实在是一个好老百姓，旧年刘汝明往江那边退，把我们江北老百姓连人带船都拴去了不知有多少，挨打受饿，实在难熬啊，我这才半夜渡江，往回跑！
    杨：你不要胡说，敌人白白就让你跑回来了。
    老人：老总，在江那边也是活不了啦，就瞅空子拼命往回跑，跑出来了就是一条命，跑不出也比活受罪好！（说着把衣服脱了，指着满身伤痕。）你们看，他们逼我过江来探你们消息，我不肯，就把我用绳子滑到桅杆上，背着手吊了一天，这……这都是绳勒的印子，我要是说一句假话，你们就给我一颗子弹。
    史：你站起来说，你是哪里人？
    程：我就是这一块的，我姓程，就是前边石塘湖边边上的，就在这地方，住了好几辈子了。
    杨：谁能给你做保？
    程：老总，你们不信，随便找一个大人小孩来，他们都认识我，我是程百合，儿子叫程万里，父子俩都是船夫。
    杨：对嘛，那就去找吧。
    史：副班长，那你带他们一块去吧。
    杨：快走，看看你到底是个什么坏东西。
    ——幕——
    第二场：
    第二天上午，沈大嫂茅屋前，屋前有短篱，土坡，坡后为闪亮耀眼的石塘湖。
    开幕时，沈大嫂扛着一捆碗口粗的竹子，自外边走上来，刚到茅屋门口，忽然转过身。
    沈（自言自语）：咦，怎么都不在屋里啦？（向短篱外）毛＠，毛＠！
    毛：嗯！
    沈：六班同志都上么地方去了？
    毛（从外边跑进来）：妈，他们都走了，听王副班长说，他们出去找船了，说今天一天就要他们找出二十只船咧！
    沈：唉，这些年青人啊，真可怜，挖工事挖了几通宵，昨黑夜鸡子叫才回来，连一觉也没睡，就又出去了。
    毛：妈，你扛这些破竹子回来做么事？
    沈：你忘了，昨儿擦黑，六班长不是说要做什么救生架，今天我特地跑了十来家，才找到这多，不晓得他们还使上使不上。老天爷，叫他们早一天过江吧，早一天过江，你爹就能早些回来了。
    毛：妈，石塘湖西岸程家老爷爷从江南偷跑回来了。
    沈：啊，这老头子回来了，你看见啦，他见你爹了吗？
    毛：街上人都在说，妈，我去看看吧。
    沈：快去，好好打听你爹在那边怎么样？
    毛：好，那我就去了。
    （隔院传来吵吵闹闹的声音。）
    毛：隔院古老奶奶不知道又同什么人吵嘴了。
    沈：唉，这个老奶奶，心眼真窄，一天到晚总是指鸡骂狗的。
    （吵嘴声渐高，可以听到一个老太婆光着嗓子哭叫的声音：“同志，我还能哄你啊，我家里真是没有船，么人告诉你们的，么人告诉你们的？”一个战士的声音：“你隔院沈大嫂就知道嘛，你还瞒哄个什么？”老太婆的声音：“那我就去问她，那我就去问她。”）
    （古老奶奶又说又叫，指手划脚，跌跌撞撞上。）
    （副班长王治五领李富贵随上）
    古：沈大嫂，你真会活冤枉人，什么鬼告诉你，说我家有船，你几辈子见啦，你几辈子见啦？
    沈：古老奶奶，么事啊，坐下来慢慢讲嘛！
    古：有船，有船，旧年刘汝明往江那边退的时候，不是把我们江边上的大船小船，挨家挨户的都收走了吗？这你也不是不知道。
    王：古老奶奶，你老人家有话慢慢说，真没有的话，不能硬逼着你要。
    沈：是呀，解放军同志在我们这里住了快上半年了，他们待老百姓么样，你还不知道？还有叫你老奶奶过不去的事情，我们该帮忙的地方还用得同志们费嘴费舌啦？
    古：能帮助的你去帮忙，我手长袖子短，够不上有什么办法哟。
    李（抢上来）：就把你那只船借给我们用用就行了。
    古：唉，你们真是烧香摸错了庙门，蚊子咬菩萨咬错了人啦，人家有船的你们不找，偏偏找到我头上来了。
    沈：老奶奶，话不能这样讲，谁帮忙是谁对解放军的心意，我家那只破船，用了几辈子都零散了，我还打算修补修补给同志们用呢，你拿出来，是记在你的帐上，别糊涂啦。
    古：沈大嫂，你的话都是好话，我那只小渔船，要是在手边的话，还用跟同志生这闲气，早就会拿给他们用了。
    毛：船不在你手边？
    古：就是呀！
    毛：（学舌）就是呀。昨天我还看见你外甥撑着它在大石桥下边打渔呢。
    古：说的就是＠，他划到枞阳镇卖鱼了，谁知道＠时候给送回来。
    王：古老奶奶，只要你答应给我们用，我们可以等一等，再不，就派人上枞阳去找。
    古（无可奈何的自语）：少桨没橹的，看你们＠事用法。
    李：你这老太婆真……………。
    王：老奶奶，你老人家不用担心，少你什么就给你配，损坏了，打上只新的赔你。
    古：赔不赔吧，都是一家人，说那话不顶用处。苦只苦得我个老婆子，上无片瓦，下无寸土，家里又无儿无女，就靠我外甥撑着那只小渔船养活我。
    王：老奶奶，你的难处我们知道，我们打过长江去，还不是为着叫你们早点过好日子，我们借了你家的船，用一天给你一天粮食，要是你外甥能同船一块来，我给他发水上服务证，吃喝都归公家管，还是一辈的光荣呢！
    毛：还有这么多好事情啊，妈，我俩也带上那只小船，送同志们过江吧。
    李：要你们老婆孩子用场不大，只要你们把船上的东西给拾掇干净，弄利洒就行了。
    沈：同志们，我自打十七八岁上就嫁到船上来，生儿养女快三十年了，不管长江刮多大的风，掀多高的浪，还没有吓倒过我，这回要用得着的话，我还可以给解放军出一把力。
    李：这不是平常叫你在江边上打渔，是要坐着船在真枪真炮底下干的！
    沈：同志，我就是不会打仗，只要你们敢打着过，我就敢把船划过去。
    王：老李，看人家女人家！叫你当水手，你都不报名。
    李：好嘛，要多有这样的女人，那还怕什么！
    王：老奶奶，你怎么样，还是把船借给我们用一用吧。
    古：好，你们要用船，明天叫人开回来，就只有一样，我那外甥年青，没见过事，可不能跟你们去！
    王：行嘛！
    沈：副班长，你们船差多少，有了门路了没有？
    王：还差得远呢，沈大嫂，这一片，谁家还有船？
    沈：有，船是不少，都给敌人强迫沉到湖里去了。要找，那也容易，有一大半在湖西岸浅水里边哩，你们看见湖水冒泡，那底下就有船。
    王：啊，还有这个说法啊，那就好办了。
    沈：我还可以跟你去找、连毛＠都能看出来。（杨虎与张双林上）。
    杨：真他妈的泄气，把两条腿都快跑断了，连个船毛也没有。
    张：你行呀，再给老百姓动态度呀！
    杨：象你好，一杠子也压不出个屁来。老百姓给你的船呢？
    王：你们两个人到底怎么回事，船动员得怎么样了？
    杨：副班长，我建个议，别他娘求爷爷告奶奶的活受洋罪，找几个洗澡盆划过去算了。这可家家都有。
    李：碰了钉子啦吧，准没有找着，看你这草杂毛，我们六班的计划一定要给你们这个小组破坏了。
    杨：你别吹牛，你找一只来给我看看。
    李：看就看，这不是，沈大嫂，古老奶奶，一个人就一只。
    张：走，老杨，再去找吧，不怨天，不怨地，只怨我们没本事。
    杨：有本事你就领头使出来，走！
    王：你们站一站，我看你们要检讨下动员方式才好，这儿是新区，老百姓对我们不了解。无论做什么事情，都要好好解释，象这老奶奶吧，家里明明有个船，我们开头没有好好给人家解释，才费了好大劲。
    沈：副班长，我们这里老百姓就是不开通，都是叫土匪军队吓怕了，有些事情给他们说明白了，还是好办。
    古：我是老糊涂了，我是老糊涂了，同志们可别跟我一般见识。
    门外声：沈大嫂，沈大嫂？
    沈：嗯啊，是程大爷，快来坐吧。
    （程百合领着儿子程万里上）。
    程（见了王）啊呀，王副班长，你们就在这里住啊！
    王：对，我们就在这里。
    沈：程大爷，快坐吧。
    古（同时）：老头子啊，你还能活着回来啊，可叫人给你们操坏心了。
    李：怎么，你们都认识？
    沈：都是家门口的老邻居了。（对程）听见你回来，我正要叫小毛＠去找你。（顿）你一个人回来的。
    程：一个人。
    沈：你们家的船呢？
    程：还在江那边。
    沈：程大爷，我们毛＠他爹可还好？
    程：唉，沈大嫂，别提了，给狗日拉过江的，哪还会好？你闭上眼睛也能想得到，还用得着细打听啊！
    沈：程大爷，到底怎么回事？你老人家要好好给我说说。
    程：说不说都一样，（掀起衣服。）你看我身上这些血道道。
    沈：怎么，毛＠他爹也挨打啦。
    程：唉，蒋介石那老狗日“气数”一定要完了，简直拿人不当人，我活了五六十岁，还是头一次。
    沈：程大爷，毛＠他爹打的可厉害不？
    程：唉！
    沈：你说呀！
    程万里：沈大嫂，说出来你可不要心急，听我爹说，沈大哥在江那边给那些坏东西打得直吐血，这一会连站都站不起来。
    沈：真的？（焦急）我的老天爷啊，你怎不睁开眼看看呢，这，这可怎么办？
    古（同情）啧，啧，这些害人精，把个活蹦活跳的沈大哥也给打得吐血啦，唉，这才是活作孽啦！
    沈（哭）：毛＠他爹，毛＠他爹，他活活受了一辈子，从来没有欺过人，害过人，想不到会落到这样下场………
    程：沈大嫂，你也不要难过，这一会我们不盼天，不盼地，只盼解放军早些打过江去就好了。你还没看见江南老百姓过的日子呢，现在哪一家不是鬼哭神嚎的给人家害得连头都抬不起来。
    王：沈大嫂，你放心吧，这个仇我们一定会给你们报的。
    沈：副班长，你说，你们哪一天才能过江呢？
    王：这……
    沈：你说呀，你说呀？
    王：哪一天过，我可不知道，反正我们还没有准备好。
    沈：副班长，同志们，你们船没找好，我跟我儿子帮你们找，你们救生架没做好，我找竹子给你们做，你们不会水，给你们教；我只求同志们一件事，你们能早一天过江，就能早救好些老百姓性命。
    程：对啦，你们一定要早过，可不能耽误了，江南老百姓想你们，盼你们都快发疯了。同志，听说你们不是找水手吗？我在江上划了四五十年船，能用八面风，我领上我这个儿子来报名，愿意送同志们过长江，你们看这能行不能行？
    王：那可好！老人家你上了些年纪，在江那边又吃了好多苦头，你还是在家里多养息养息，有你儿子来，我们已经很欢迎了。
    程：同志，我是个闲不住的人，昨天回来，家里都说同志好，一心一意为老百姓办事，家里人说同志用一盆水，也给挑个满缸，真是再好也没有了。这次你们过长江，一定用得着我，我一定卖把力，哈，这真是百年难遇的事。
    王：老人家，你还是歇歇吧，有你儿子就很好了。
    程：同志们。你们要放一百二十个心，到时候我说什么也要把同志们送过去，有我老头子，就有你们。
    王：瞧你身上的伤还没有好呢。
    程：咳，这一点伤，可算不了什么一回事。同志，答应我，让我送你们过吧，保险不出麻烦。
    李：老头子，你真能架船，可不要卖嘴。
    程：我这胡子八拉的，还能当着你们这些年青人说假话。
    李：好，你要是真行，你能不能跳到这石塘湖里，绕一个转转回来！
    程：好，你们看。（把衣服一脱，走向土堤。）
    王：老人家，可别！
    程：同志们，你们看好！（说着通的一声跳了下去。）
    王：老人家，老人家，这可使不得！（对李）李富贵，你瞧你。
    程万里：（对王）同志，不要紧，我爹在水里可是个老在行。
    李：副班长，来，我也陪这老头子在湖里绕一转，回头你就给我登个记，我也要当水手。（把衣服脱了，也朝湖里跳下去。）
    张：李富贵，你要小心！
    李声：不要紧，旱鸭子。（高朗的笑声）哈哈，老头子，你等一等，我们来比赛比赛！
    程声：来吧，年青人！
