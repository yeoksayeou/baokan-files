　　Today, we joyfully celebrate the fifth anniversary of the rebirth of the Republic of Poland. On this day, our hearts are filled with love for our motherland. The Polish people will remember for centuries the painful and arduous years of struggle against the German fascist invaders. We extend our deepest respects to those who sacrificed themselves in the struggle. Generations of mothers will proudly tell their children that justice and truth have triumphed. Poland, liberated by the victorious Soviet and Polish armies, has risen from blood and tears, from the unwavering struggle of the working people.

　　It has been five years since the establishment of the people's government in Poland. Some people once doubted how long the people's government could last. But today, five years after the victory, who still doubts that the people's government is invincible? Who still doubts that it is a powerful source of Poland's strength and development? The enemy created unprecedented destruction for us in history, but thanks to the people's government, Poland has risen from the ruins so quickly. Only those who have become blind by despising the people, and those who do not believe in the creative power of the working masses, cannot see this. A new Warsaw, the ancient Polish cities of Wrocław and Gdańsk, are rapidly being rebuilt from the ruins created by the enemy; Polish ports are working busily, machines are humming in thousands of factories; the burned-down villages have begun a new life; a new culture is penetrating the countryside; farmers are harvesting grain on land that previously belonged to the nobility, and the grain is increasing year by year; people are living better year by year, they have more and more food and clothing; the mortality rate is decreasing, and people's health is improving. Poland has not only been rebuilt, but is developing into an increasingly beautiful country.

　　Polish workers have never worked as enthusiastically as they do today. Now, they know that they are working for themselves and for the country. Engineers, inventors, and model workers are striving for new achievements in productivity, not for parasites and hostile elements. The working intellectuals recognize that the millions of people they serve are grateful for their work. The strength of the people's government is growing due to the united efforts of all working people. In the past, millions of the poorest farmers went abroad in search of bread and work. Today, the idea of wandering abroad is irrelevant to Polish farmers, because they look forward to the future with confidence. The people's government cares about providing small and middle peasants with increasing assistance year by year.

　　Despite the destruction of the war, Polish farmers are now obtaining richer harvests than before the war. Each year, industry supplies agriculture with more tools, machines, and fertilizers. The people's government does everything possible not only to help Polish farmers obtain good harvests, but also to enable poor and middle peasants to increase land yields through intensive cultivation. People's Poland will ensure that, in due course, not a single farm household will be without oxen and tools, so that all farmers can obtain increasingly greater benefits from their work in the fields. The people's government today guarantees that the prices of farmers' produce will remain fixed even when world market prices fall. Today, Polish farmers can look forward to the future with confidence, because under the people's government, they are not threatened by violent price fluctuations, nor by the economic crises of capitalism, and because the development of consumer and producer cooperatives will help to raise the material and cultural standards of the farmers.

　　To give universal care to the common needs of all working people - this is the highest law that the people's government follows in Poland. Only those who have become blind with hatred, those degenerates and running dogs of imperialism, are unwilling to see that the reborn motherland has become the most precious possession and pride of the Polish working people. The working people are ruling Poland and building it with their creative work and loyalty. Work and emotion can transform Poland into a great country, a country that enriches the great treasury of human progress with its own harvests. We are all creators of the great transformation of Poland's economic, cultural and social life. In Poland, people are changing. The cultural needs of millions of people and the productive forces of the national economy are increasing month by month. If the Three-Year Plan is overfulfilled by the end of this year, then the program put forward by the Polish National Liberation Committee five years ago will be victoriously fulfilled. Now, the average industrial output per person has doubled compared to pre-war levels.

　　In the years after the war, the capitalist countries of Europe have not escaped the specter of crisis; their dependence on foreign imperialism is increasing day by day. For five years, we have accomplished miracles of reconstruction and economic development, because we have not only liberated ourselves from Nazi enslavement, but also from the enslavement of landlords and capitalists; we have victoriously mobilized the inexhaustible human and material resources of our country, and we have received the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union. This is why we have managed to maintain Poland's independence and improve the situation of the working people. In the next six years, we will greatly raise the living standards of the working people; we will make electricity, books, radio, telephones, theaters, and movies available to millions of people, we will eliminate illiteracy, guarantee better medical care and holidays, prolong life, and make it happier. Lasting international peace is necessary to implement this plan. We will defend and strengthen the sincere alliance and friendship of our people with the people of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and this alliance and friendship is the guarantee of Poland's security and development. The continuous strengthening of Poland's economic strength and political unity, as well as its allies and its army, guarantee peace and its independence. We will make every effort to strengthen these forces. The unity of the Polish people (which is the foundation of their success) is necessary to realize the transformation of Poland. We will strengthen this unity. The people's government has proved by its actions that it respects the traditions and feelings of believers, and guarantees complete freedom of belief and religion; it firmly adheres to this program. However, the people's government firmly opposes, and will continue to firmly oppose, those liars and reactionaries who exploit the ignorance of others (which is the result of a long period of backwardness).

　　The road to work, the road to the respect that the people give to their excellent soldiers, is open to every Pole, to every well-intentioned person. Poland's future belongs to all of us and our descendants; Poland's happiness is the goal of our lives, and Poland's strength and greatness are our pride. Let us spare no effort to build the foundation for a new life, and let us remain vigilant against the enemy.

　　波总统贝鲁特
  　在波兰解放日的演辞
    译自波兰通讯社七月二十一日电讯稿
    今天，我们愉快地庆祝波兰共和国新生的第五周年。在这一天，我们的心里充满了对于祖国的热爱。波兰人民将在今后好几世纪内纪忆着反对德国法西斯侵略者斗争中的痛苦与艰辛的岁月。我们仅向在斗争中牺牲的人们致深切的致意。一代一代的母亲们，将引以自豪地告诉她们的孩子说：正义和真理战胜了。为胜利的苏军与波军所解放的波兰，已经从血与泪，从劳动人民毫不畏缩的斗争当中兴起了。
    自从劳动人民的政权在波兰建立以来，为时已有五年了。曾经有一些人怀疑人民政权到底能维持多久。但是，在胜利五年之后的今天，谁还怀疑人民政权是不可征服的呢？谁还怀疑它是波兰强盛与发展的强有力的源泉呢？敌人曾给我们制造了历史上空前的破坏，但由于人民政权的原故，波兰是多么迅速地从废墟中兴起了。只有那些因蔑视人民而变得盲目的人们，和那些不相信劳动群众底创造性力量的人们，才看不到这一点。一个新的华沙、波兰古城罗克劳和但泽，正迅速地从敌人所制造的废墟中兴建起来；波兰的港口繁忙地工作着，机器正在数以千计的工厂里响动着；被焚毁的乡村已开始了新的生活；新的文化正深入到农村去，农民们在先前属于贵族的土地上收割着谷物，谷物正逐年增加着；人民生活得一年比一年好，他们有着越来越多的食物和衣服；死亡率正在减低，人民的健康正在改善。波兰不仅重建起来了，而且正发展为越来越美丽的国家。
    波兰工人从没有象今天这样热情地劳动过，现在，他们深知他们是为他们自己而且也为国家而工作着。工程师、发明家和劳动模范，正在为争取生产力的新成就而奋斗，他们不是为了寄生虫和敌对分子而努力。劳动知识分子认识到他们所服务的千百万人民很感谢他们的工作。人民政权的力量，正由于一切劳动人民的一致努力而增长着。过去，千千万万的最贫苦的农民，曾出国寻找面包和工作。而今天，流浪国外的想法是与波兰农民不相干的，因为他们满怀信心地展望着未来。人民政权关心使小农和中农得到一年比一年增加的援助。
    尽管有战争的破坏，但是，波兰农民现在却获得比战前更丰富的收获。每年，工业供给农业以更多的工具、机器和肥料。人民政权尽一切力量不仅帮助波兰农民去获得丰收，并且也使贫农和中农以深耕细作的方法提高土地的产量。人民波兰将注意在适当的时期内使没有一个农户没有耕牛与工具，使全体农民能在田地的工作中获得越来越大的利益。人民政权在今天已经保证着农民的生产物在世界市场的价格下降的时候仍保持固定价格。今天，波兰农民可以满怀信心地展望着将来，因为他们在人民政权下，并不为价格的猛烈波动所威胁，不为资本主义的经济危机所威胁，而且因为消费与生产合作社的发展，将有助于提高农民底物质与文化水平。
    对于一切劳动人民的共同需要予以普遍的关怀，——这是人民政权在波兰所奉行的最高的法则。只有那些因憎恨而变得盲目的人们，那些蜕化分子和帝国主义的走狗，才不愿看见新生的祖国已成为波兰劳动人民最宝贵的财产和骄傲。劳动人民正在统治着波兰，并以其创造性的工作和忠诚建设着波兰。工作、感情能把波兰改变成伟大的国家，成为以其自己的收获来充实全人类进步的伟大宝库的国家。我们都是波兰底经济、文化和社会生活之伟大转变的创造者。在波兰，人正在改变着。千百万人民的文化需求，国民经济的生产力量在逐月增加着。倘若在本年底以前超过地完成三年计划，那么，就是胜利地履行了人民政权在五年以前的波兰民族解放委员会宣言上所提出的纲领。现在，每人的平均工业生产额较战前已增加了一倍。
    战后几年来，欧洲的资本主义国家并没有摆脱危机的幽灵；它们对外国帝国主义的依赖性一天比一天增加。五年以来，我们业已完成了重建与经济发展的奇迹，因为我们不仅从纳粹的奴役下解放了我们自己，而且也从地主与资本家的奴役下解放了我们自己；我们已胜利地动员了我们国家的无穷尽的人力、物力，我们获得了苏联兄弟般的帮助。这就是为什么我们已使得波兰的独立保持下来，并且改善了劳动人民底境遇的原因。在往后六年的过程中，我们将大大地提高劳动人民的生活标准；我们将使电力、书籍、无线电、电话、剧院、电影能为数以百万计的人民所享受，我们将消灭文盲，保证较好的医药供给与假期，延长人的寿命，并使之更加幸福。国际上的持久和平是实行这一计划所必须的。我们将捍卫与加强我们人民对苏联和各人民民主国家人民的诚挚的联盟与友谊，而这种联盟与友谊，是波兰的安全与发展的保证。波兰底经济力量与政治团结的不断加强，以及它的盟友和它的军队，保证着和平和它的独立。我们将尽一切努力来加强这些力量。波兰人民的团结（这是他们取得成功的基础），是实现波兰的转化所必须的。我们将加强这个团结。人民政权以其所作所为证明了：它尊重教徒的传统与感情，它保证着信仰、信奉宗教的完全自由；它坚决地信守这一纲领。然而，人民政权坚决地反对，而且将来也坚决地反对那些利用他人底愚昧无知（这种愚昧无知是长时期落后的结果）的骗子与反动分子。
    到工作的道路，到人民给他们底优秀战士以尊敬的道路，为每一位波兰人，为每一位善意的人敞开着。波兰的未来是我们大家和我们子孙的；波兰的幸福是我们生活的目标，波兰的力量与伟大是我们底骄傲。让我们不遗余力地去建立新生活的基础，让我们保持对敌人的警惕。【新华社北平二十三日电】
