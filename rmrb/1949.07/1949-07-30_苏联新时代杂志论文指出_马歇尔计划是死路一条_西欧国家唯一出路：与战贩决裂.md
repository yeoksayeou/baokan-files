Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: Moscow dispatch: Leontiev published an article in the latest issue of "New Times" entitled "The Marshall Plan is a Dead End," which stated:

　　With the economic crisis maturing in the United States, the difficulties faced by the Western European countries under the Marshall Plan have become increasingly acute. Against this background, the parties participating in the Marshall Plan have held successive meetings and negotiations.

　　The negotiations between the vicious American creditors and their Western European debtors are surrounded by a fog of conflicting news, rumors, and denials. But two things are undoubtedly clear within the fog: First, the American lenders are forcing the devaluation of Western European currencies, especially the pound sterling; Second, the British rulers oppose this. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps said: "The government has no intention of devaluing the pound sterling." Cripps also said that purchases of goods from the dollar area must be reduced to a minimum, and all other dollar expenditures must also be reduced in the next three months. These words were regarded in the United States as a heavy blow to American exporters of oil, wheat, cotton, and tobacco, whose inventories are increasing to a particularly ominous extent.

　　Britain hopes to compensate for the reduction in purchases from the dollar area by developing bilateral trade and barter agreements with other countries. The British government is posing this threat, hoping that American lenders will loosen their purse strings in order to obtain some more gold and dollar loans from the United States. American exporters are demanding that their government retaliate by reducing or completely stopping Marshall Plan appropriations to Britain. American monopoly capital demands the development of multilateral trade to counter Britain's plans.

　　The conflict between the economic plans of Britain and the United States makes the failure of the Marshall Plan more obvious than ever. The British plan attempts to at least break some of the shackles that the Marshall Plan, for the benefit of American monopoly capital, has placed on Britain's trade with other countries. The American plan intends to take advantage of the current appalling poverty of Western European countries to tighten the noose of economic enslavement, thus solving the irreconcilable contradictions inherent in the Marshall Plan. This irreconcilable contradiction has been a fatal flaw in the Marshall Plan economic system from the very beginning. At that time, the Marshall Plan was touted as a tool to overcome the dollar shortage in Western Europe, but it proved not only not to overcome it, but also to aggravate it, and the dollar shortage has become an epidemic. In addition, short-sighted Western European politicians, especially the British Labor Party rulers, had hoped that the Marshall Plan would enable the imperialist countries to rebuild their position and continue to securely exploit their colonies, but their illusions have also been shattered. American monopoly capital is using the Marshall Plan as a tool to penetrate the colonial kingdoms of other countries.

　　Finally, the Marshall Plan advocates on both sides of the Atlantic fraudulently assured the gullible that this plan would create "Western unity" and a "great Atlantic family," that is, eliminate conflicts between imperialist countries. In the eyes of the world, today's imperialist camp is a place of endless strife, and the most intense conflict is between the United States and its little partner, Britain.

　　The author concludes that the failure of the Marshall Plan is also the failure of the Marshallization policy followed by the governments of Western European countries.

　　It is becoming increasingly clear that American expansion means the economic and political enslavement of European countries, while making these countries victims of sharp conflicts. The policy of kowtowing to American imperialism is leading Western European countries to economic turmoil and crisis. This means increased unemployment, a further decline in already miserable living standards, and a more insecure future.

　　The countries that have entered the dead end of the Marshall Plan have only one way out, and that is to break with the policy of war profiteers and adopt the policy of sincere international cooperation on an equal footing advocated by the Soviet Union and other democratic countries.

　　苏联新时代杂志论文指出
  　马歇尔计划是死路一条
    西欧国家唯一出路：与战贩决裂
    【新华社北平二十九日电】莫斯科讯：里昂捷夫在最近一期新时代发表论文，题为“马歇尔计划死路一条”，内称：
    在经济危机正在美国成熟的情形下，西欧马歇尔化国家面临的困难已变得越来越尖锐。在这种背景下，参与马歇尔计划的各方连续地举行了会议和谈判。
    围绕在狠毒的美国债主和他们的西欧债务人之间所进行的谈判周围，是充满着互相矛盾的消息、谣传和否认的迷雾。但是迷雾里面有两件事是无疑的：一、美国放债人在逼迫西欧货币特别是英镑的贬值；二、英国的统治者反对这样做。英国财政大臣克里浦斯曾说：“政府丝毫无意将英镑贬值”。克里浦斯又说：向美元地区购买的货物，必须减至最低限度，一切其他的美元开支今后三个月也要减少。他这些话在美国被认为是对美国石油、小麦、棉花和烟草出口商的一记沉重的打击。而这些商品的存货却正增加到了特别不祥的程度。
    英国期望用和其他国家发展双边贸易和易货协定的方法来弥补自美元地区购货的减少。英国政府摆出这个威胁，希望美国放债人能够放松钱袋，以便从美国再取得一些黄金与美元贷款。而美国出口商则要求他们的政府进行报复，减少或者完全停止给英国马歇尔计划的拨款。美国垄断资本要求发展多边贸易，以对付英国的计划。
    英国和美国这两个经济计划之间的冲突，使得马歇尔计划的失败比以往任何时候都更为明显。英国计划企图至少打破马歇尔计划为了美国垄断资本的利益而加在英国对其他国家贸易上的一部分束缚。美国计划打算利用西欧国家目前可怖的穷困，以勒紧经济奴役的圈套，这样来解决马歇尔计划所固有的不可调和的矛盾。这种不可调和的矛盾从一开始起就是马歇尔计划经济体系中的致命伤。那时马歇尔计划被吹嘘为克服西欧美元荒的工具，但事实证明它不仅没有克服，而且加重了美元荒，美元荒已经成了一种流行病。此外，近视的西欧政客，特别是英国的工党统治者，曾期望马歇尔计划将使帝国主义国家能以重建它们的地位，以继续对它们的殖民地进行安稳的剥削，但是他们的这一幻想也破灭了。美国垄断资本是利用马歇尔计划作为打入其他国家的殖民地王国的工具。
    最后，大西洋两岸的马歇尔计划拥护者们，奸诈地向容易受骗的人保证：这个计划将造成“西方的团结”和“大西洋大家庭”，也就是说可以消除帝国主义国家间的冲突。在全世界人眼前，今天的帝国主义阵营就是一个无穷无尽纷争的场所，最激烈的冲突是发生在美国和它的小伙伴英国之间。
    作者结语说：马歇尔计划的失败，也就是西欧各国政府所遵循的马歇尔化政策的失败。
    美国的扩张意味着欧洲国家在经济和政治上的被奴役，同时使这些国家成为尖锐冲突的牺牲品，这是一天比一天更为明显的了。向美帝国主义叩头的政策，正将西欧国家引向经济变乱和危机。这意味着失业增加，已经够悲惨的生活水准的进一步低落，和未来的更无保障。
    已经走入马歇尔计划死路的国家只有一条出路，这就是与战争贩子的政策决裂，采取苏联与其他民主国家所主张的在平等基础上的真诚的国际合作方针。
