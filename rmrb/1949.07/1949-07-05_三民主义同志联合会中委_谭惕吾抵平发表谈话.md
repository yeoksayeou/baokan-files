　　Central Committee Member of the Sanmin Zhuyi Comrades Association
  　Tan Tiwu Arrives in Beiping and Issues Statement
    [Our Dispatch] Ms. Tan Tiwu, a Central Committee member of the Sanmin Zhuyi Comrades Association, arrived in Beiping via a circuitous route last month. Ms. Tan, under the guise of a member of the pseudo-Legislative Yuan, engaged in secret work to undermine the reactionary regime. When interviewed by reporters yesterday about her impressions after coming to the liberated areas, Ms. Tan issued the following statement:

    What moved me most in the liberated areas was that the people have stood up, spontaneously supporting their own government and engaging in economic construction with fervor. The working cadres in the liberated areas are hardworking and simple, serving the people wholeheartedly. People's Leader Chairman Mao and other leaders of the CCP are using scientific foresight to wisely lead the Chinese revolution, ensuring that China will inevitably and smoothly complete its New Democratic construction.

    Conversely, the Kuomintang reactionary clique represents the interests of imperialism, bureaucratic capital, and feudal forces. Therefore, even though they know they are about to enter the grave, they will continue to oppose the people and the revolution to the very end. Two months ago, I still hoped that the Li Zongren clique would be able to decide to surrender to the people. Now, facts have proven that Li Zongren still stands on the side of the counter-revolution at the crucial moment. For this kind of reactionary clique that refuses to surrender, only resolute, thorough, and complete annihilation can achieve the complete victory of the people's revolution. As for the ordinary personnel working under the reactionary regime, they should quickly perform meritorious deeds to redeem themselves in order to avoid the fate of following the reactionary leaders into the grave.

    After entering the liberated areas, I have become even more aware that my understanding of the revolution is insufficient and that my ideology and work style need to be transformed. In the future, I am willing to follow the CCP and Chairman Mao's leadership, learn from all democratic progressives, intensify my studies, strive to transform myself, and resolutely stand with the proletariat, in order to contribute my meager efforts to the New Democratic construction.

　　三民主义同志联合会中委
  　谭惕吾抵平发表谈话
    【本报讯】三民主义同志联合会中央委员谭惕吾女士月前绕道来平。谭氏曾以伪立法院委员的身份，从事瓦解反动政权的秘密工作。记者日昨访问谭氏来解放区后观感，谭氏当发表谈话如下：
    在解放区，最让我感动的，是人民翻了身，自动起来拥护自己的政权，紧张地从事经济建设。解放区的工作干部艰苦朴实，全心全意地为人民服务。人民领袖毛主席和中共其他领导者用科学的预见来英明地领导中国革命，使中国将必然顺利地完成新民主主义建设。
    相反地，国民党反动集团代表着帝国主义、官僚资本和封建势力的利益，所以他们明知就要走进坟墓，也要反人民反革命到底。前两个月，我还希望李宗仁集团能够决心向人民投降。现在事实证明了李宗仁到了重要关头仍然是站在反革命方面。对于这种拒绝投降的反动集团，只有坚决彻底干净全部消灭之，才能实现人民革命的彻底胜利。至于在反动政权之下工作的普通人员，应当赶快立功自赎，才能免除跟随反动头目一同走进坟墓的命运。
    本人在进入解放区以后，更加感到自己对革命认识不够，思想作风需要改造。今后愿在中共和毛主席领导下，追随各民主先进，加紧学习，努力改造自己，坚决地和无产阶级站在一起，以期在新民主主义建设中竭尽微力。
