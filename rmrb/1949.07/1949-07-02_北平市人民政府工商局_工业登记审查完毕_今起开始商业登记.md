　　Industrial Registration Review Completed; Commercial Registration to Begin Today

　　[Report from this newspaper] The Peiping Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce is conducting industrial and commercial registration to support industry and develop production. The first phase of industrial registration, focusing on the four key industries of dyeing and weaving, machinery and ironwork, metal smelting, and knitting, was completed on the 15th of last month, totaling over 1,500 businesses. The second phase of industrial registration included 15 industries such as rubber, kiln, paper-making, leather-making, dyeing, sesame oil, matches, cigarettes, soy sauce, carpets, soda, soap and alkali production, foreign wine, flour, and printing. Registration was largely completed by the end of last month. A total of 1,823 businesses applied for registration, of which 1,621 were approved after review. Business licenses are now being issued. This registration process was smoother than the first phase. Before registration, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce led the districts and streets to organize factories into groups for registration according to their organizational systems. The directors and supervisors of various industry associations enthusiastically assisted, making the registration process rapid and minimizing omissions. Among the 15 industries that have been reviewed and approved for business licenses, there are 196 rubber businesses, 32 kiln businesses, 164 leather-making businesses, 194 dyeing businesses, 68 paper-making businesses, 92 sesame oil businesses, 7 match businesses, 11 cigarette businesses, 64 soy sauce businesses, 90 carpet businesses, 27 soda businesses, 296 soap and alkali production businesses, 10 foreign wine businesses, 17 flour businesses, and 25 printing businesses. A total of 202 businesses from various industries were not approved for the following reasons: 1. Incomplete procedures; 2. Some companies should have submitted applications to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval; 3. Reviews are not yet complete. Once the procedures are completed and the reviews are passed, business licenses will be issued.

　　Another report: The Bureau of Industry and Commerce will begin universal commercial registration starting today (the 2nd). There are a total of 124 commercial industries in the city. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce has decided to conduct registration in phases. The first phase of registration will cover 12 industries, including grain depots, rice and flour, coal yards, coal shops, firewood and charcoal, oil shops, fresh and dried fruits, mountain goods, cloth, silk and satin, weaving and dyeing, and cotton, totaling more than 5,000 households. The steps are as follows: first, conduct investigation, statistics, and organizational work; after statistics, registration will be conducted by industry. At the same time, each industry will form an industry registration working committee to assist in registration matters. The directors and supervisors of each industry association will be ex officio members, and others familiar with the industry's situation and fair in their work will be hired as members. This committee will be responsible for receiving, issuing, copying, reviewing, and investigating matters, and will supervise the registration work of its respective industry. On the other hand, under the leadership of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, a municipal registration working committee composed of personnel from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and staff members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will be formed to supervise the work of the industry registration working committees.
