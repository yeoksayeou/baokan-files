Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: Reports from various sources: The nationwide strike of 24,000 Australian coal miners has entered its third week. Across Australia, 600,000 workers have stopped work due to the lack of coal power. The striking miners reiterated that the release of the arrested trade union leaders and the exemption of all fines against the trade union and its leaders are prerequisites for resolving the dispute.

The Australian government continues to carry out a frenzied suppression of the working class. On the 8th, fifty armed policemen and many plainclothes detectives suddenly surrounded the headquarters of the Australian Communist Party and the building housing the Australian Communist Party's "Tribune," conducting a three-hour search and hauling away several truckloads of documents and printed materials. On July 12, the police again searched the "Tribune's" printing plant. In addition, the police also searched many union offices and the residences of union leaders. On the 11th, the Sydney Arbitration Court continued to sentence William, chairman of the miners' union, and Grant, the union's secretary, to twelve months' imprisonment for so-called "contempt of court," and fined the union 2,000 Australian pounds.

The Labor government's high-handed measures have aroused angry protests from workers across Australia. A mass rally of 20,000 people was held in Sydney on the 10th. Many union representatives attending the rally supported the miners' strike in their speeches. The conference also passed a resolution protesting the Arbitration Court's suppression and demanding the abolition of anti-strike legislation. All Australian seamen also held a 24-hour general strike on the 12th in protest.

    澳两万余煤矿工人
    大罢工进入第三周
    全国海员罢工一日声援
    【新华社北平十五日电】各方报道：震撼全国的澳大利亚二万四千煤矿工人的大罢工，已进入第三周。全澳因缺乏煤电而停止工作的工人，已达六十万人。罢工矿工重申以释放被捕的工会领袖，豁免对工会与工会领袖的一切罚金为解决争议的先决条件。
    澳大利亚政府继续对工人阶级进行疯狂的镇压。八日，五十名武装警察与许多便衣侦探突然包围了澳共总部与澳共“论坛报”所在地的大楼，作了三小时的搜查，运走了几卡车的文件与印刷品。七月十二日，警察又搜查了“论坛报”的印刷厂。此外，警察也搜查了许多工会会址及工会领袖的住宅。十一日，悉尼仲裁法庭继续以所谓“蔑视法庭”之罪，判处矿工工会主席威廉姆与该工会书记格兰特以十二个月徒刑，并课该工会以两千澳镑的罚金。
    工党政府的这种高压手段，激起了全澳工人的愤怒抗议。悉尼在十日举行了二万人的群众大会，出席大会的许多工会代表，在发言中支持矿工罢工。大会并通过决议，抗议仲裁法庭的镇压行动，并要求废除反罢工立法。澳大利亚全体海员，至十二日也举行了二十四小时的抗议总罢工。
