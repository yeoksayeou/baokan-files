Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS, Milan dispatch: The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions unanimously adopted a declaration on the closing day, excerpts of which are as follows:

　　Men and women workers! Working people of the world!

　　The World Federation of Trade Unions, established at the First World Congress of Trade Unions, unites trade unions from almost all countries of the world in its ranks, regardless of race, nationality, religion, or political belief. The World Federation of Trade Unions is the greatest achievement of the working class, because the strength of the working class lies in its unity.

　　The World Federation of Trade Unions is operating under complex international circumstances, at a time when imperialists are once again threatening to launch a world war. The freedom-loving people of all nations, who bled to defeat fascism and cherish the hope for a better future, hope that the world will finally be free from the threat of new wars. They believe that friendly international cooperation will be established, and that the full employment of the people and the inviolability of democratic rights and freedoms will be guaranteed.

　　However, the bourgeois governments have treacherously violated the solemn oaths they declared during the war. The tears of widows and orphans have not yet dried, and the cities and villages destroyed by fascist bandits are still in ruins, but the imperialists are already preparing for new wars, trying to establish world hegemony.

　　War is a source of unprecedented enrichment for capitalists. In the United States, Britain, and some other capitalist countries, the arms race is in full swing again. Capitalists place the heavy burden of military expenditure entirely on the shoulders of the working class and all working people. Inflation and taxes are increasing, and market prices are rising catastrophically. At the same time, wages are falling steadily, and the army of unemployed, which now numbers in the tens of millions, is expanding rapidly.

　　The policy pursued by the imperialists—a policy most vividly expressed in the so-called Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty, which serve the purpose of economic and political enslavement of all nations—is a weapon for realizing the aggressive plans of the instigators of new wars.

　　In preparing for new wars, the imperialists are trying to suppress the democratic movement, first and foremost the labor movement. In order to realize their various plans, they are trying to undermine the international solidarity of the working people and to divide and corrupt the ranks of the working class in each country. Within the World Federation of Trade Unions, some have tried in vain to defend the policies and actions of the imperialist groups—warmongers—in their countries. Representatives of the British Trades Union Congress and the American CIO, who supported this anti-people policy, attempted to paralyze the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, with the aim of abolishing the World Federation of Trade Unions and splitting the unity of the world's working class. When these attempts failed, Deakin and Carey withdrew from the World Federation of Trade Unions without consulting the workers in their countries. Now, they are trying to establish a subversive organization hostile to the World Federation of Trade Unions in order to undermine and disintegrate the ranks of the working class in the face of the offensive launched by monopoly capital against the vital interests of the working people. However, these attempts by the enemies of peace and the working class to divide the labor ranks are doomed to failure. No one can destroy the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　The evil plans of the imperialists and their lackeys are opposed by the firm will of hundreds of millions of men and women in all countries of the world who are striving for peace, unity, and cooperation. The democratic forces that defend peace are great and powerful. They far surpass the strength of the reactionaries and are able to contain them. The strength of the defenders of peace is based on a strong democratic labor movement, on the growing national liberation movement in colonial and dependent countries, and on the support of all honest human beings, defenders of peace and progress.

　　Our common task, the task of the working people of the world, is to build an impregnable barrier against the warmongers and to smash the insidious plans of imperialism. Workers of physical and mental labor! We earnestly appeal to you: Launch extensive activities to defend peace, unite regardless of race, nationality, or political and religious beliefs. Where conditions permit, establish peace committees in enterprises and institutions, and unite all physical and mental laborers in the ranks of peace committees.

### 世界工联宣言　世界劳动人民团结起来　粉碎帝国主义战争阴谋

　　世界工联宣言
  　世界劳动人民团结起来
  　粉碎帝国主义战争阴谋
    【新华社北平十三日电】塔斯社米兰讯：世界工联第二届代表大会在闭幕日一致通过宣言，摘要如下：
    男女工人们！世界的劳动人民们！
    在第一届世界职工会代表大会上成立的世界工联，不分种族、国籍、宗教与政治信仰的不同，把全世界几乎一切国家的职工会团结在它的行列中。世界工联是工人阶级最伟大的成就，因为工人阶级的力量在于它的团结。
    世界工联正在帝国主义者又在威胁着发动世界战争的时候，在复杂的国际形势下进行活动。曾为战胜法西斯主义而流血的、怀抱对美好未来之希望的爱好自由的各族人民，希望着世界会最后地摆脱新战争的威胁。他们相信：友好的国际合作将会建立，人民的充分就业与民主权利和自由的不可侵犯性，将会得到确保。
    但是，资产阶级政府却背信弃义地违反了它们在战时所宣布的庄严誓言。寡妇、孤儿的眼泪未干，法西斯匪徒所破坏的城市与乡村仍然是一片废墟，而帝国主义者却已在准备新的战争，力图建立世界霸权了。
    战争是资本家空前致富的源泉。在美国、英国及若干其他资本主义国家，军备竞赛又在全力进行中。资本家把军费的沉重负担完全放在工人阶级与一切劳动人民底肩头上。通货膨胀与捐税增长着，市场价格灾难性地飞涨着。同时，工资却节节降落，人数现已达数千万的失业大军，仍在迅速地扩大着。
    帝国主义者所奉行的政策——这种政策最生动地表现在为经济上与政治上奴役各族人民的这些目的而服务的所谓马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约上面——是实现新战争挑拨者的侵略计划的武器。
    帝国主义者在准备新战争当中，力图镇压民主运动，首先是劳工运动。为了实现他们的各种计划，他们试图破坏劳动人民的国际团结，并分裂与腐蚀每个国家的工人阶级队伍。在世界工联的内部，有人曾徒劳地试图为他们国家的帝国主义集团——战争贩子的政策与行动辩护。支持这种反人民政策的英国职工大会与美国产联的代表们，曾试图瘫痪世界工联的活动，他们的目的在于取消世界工联并分裂世界工人阶级的团结。而当这些企图均告失败之后，狄金与加莱就未经征询他们国家工人们的意见，即行退出了世界工联。现在，他们正在试图成立与世界工联相敌对的颠覆性的组织，以便在独占资本对劳动人民切身利益进行攻势的前面，破坏与瓦解工人阶级的队伍。然而，和平与工人阶级的敌人的这些分裂劳工队伍的企图，是注定了要失败的。没有谁能摧毁世界工联。
    帝国主义者及其走狗的邪恶计划，遇到了全世界各国亿万男女争取和平、团结与合作的坚强意志的反对。维护和平的民主力量，是伟大而强有力的。他们远远超越了反动派的力量，而且能够遏制反动派的力量。和平保卫者的力量，是以强有力的民主劳工运动、以日益增长的殖民地与附属国家的民族解放运动、以一切诚实的人类、和平与进步的保卫者的支持为基础的。
    我们共同的任务，全世界劳动人民的任务，在于对战争贩子树立不可攻破的屏障，在于粉碎帝国主义的阴险计划。体力与脑力劳动者们！我们热诚地向你们呼吁：开展广泛的保卫和平的活动，不分种族、国籍与政治、宗教信仰，团结起来。那里的条件许可，就在那里的企业与机关成立和平委员会，并将一切体力与脑力劳动者团结在和平委员会的行列中。
