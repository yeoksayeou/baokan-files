　　Northeast Completes Huge Water Conservancy Project
  　Can Increase Grain Production by 500,000 Tons
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] From March to the end of May this year, Northeast China completed a vast water conservancy project of 2,844 li on the tributaries of the two major water systems of the Liao River and Songhua River. The benefited land area reached 12 million mu, which can increase grain production by 500,000 tons. The project includes 15 rivers in the Liao River system, such as the East and West Liao Rivers, Hun River, and Taizi River, and the Songhua River system, such as the Tao'er River, Chuole River, and Tongken River. Among them, the East and West Liao Rivers, Taizi River, and Haicheng River in Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces are the key points. The completed water management projects in the two provinces have reached 1,670 li, accounting for about three-fifths of the entire Northeast water management project this time. According to statistics, the Northeast Administrative Committee has invested a total of 80,000 tons of grain in water conservancy since the beginning of spring plowing, accounting for half of the entire agricultural production and construction fund in Northeast China this year. A total of 130,000 migrant workers participated in the construction, with 6 million workdays. A total of 1,914 li of river embankments were repaired, 920 li of drainage canals were dug, and more than 18 million cubic meters of earth were excavated. After the completion of this project, the 7 million mu of waterlogged land that suffered from river flooding last year has been turned into fertile land, and the task of increasing the area of paddy fields by 830,000 mu this year has also been successfully completed. At present, the total area of paddy fields in Northeast China has reached 3 million mu, which is still 200,000 mu less than the 3.2 million mu of paddy fields developed by the Japanese invaders during the puppet Manchurian period, but it has increased by two times compared with the initial 1 million mu after the surrender of the Japanese invaders (at that time, farmers took back a large number of paddy fields and converted them into dry land).
    The guiding principle for water management in Northeast China in the second half of this year, which was determined at the first water conservancy conference held last month, is to consolidate existing projects and prepare for water management work in the spring of next year. During the current summer flood season, flood prevention is the central task. In previous years, various rivers in Northeast China often caused summer floods from the beginning of July to the end of August due to heavy rainfall. According to the forecast of the Northeast Water Conservancy Bureau, the Liao River system is now in a flood cycle (the previous two cycles were in 1929 and 1937). Although Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces have built more than 1,500 li of flood control dikes, and the situation is better than in the past, it is still necessary to pay close attention to prevention. Although the Songhua River system is not in a flood cycle this year, the existing 400 li of dikes have been newly repaired this year. If strict prevention is not taken, danger may also occur. For this reason, the Northeast Water Conservancy Bureau has specially decided to set the period from July 1 to September 10 as the flood prevention period, and has specifically formulated flood prevention measures and instructed various counties to implement them. The measures stipulate that each county should establish a flood prevention committee, with the county magistrate and the head of the agricultural section serving as the chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, to divide the defense zones and organize flood prevention work teams. In addition to preparing various materials in dangerous areas, telephone contact should be established between the upstream and downstream flood prevention committees to communicate information at any time and strictly prevent disasters.
    All rivers in Northeast China generally belong to the Liao River and Heilongjiang River systems. The Liao River originates in the bald mountains in the northern part of Rehe Province. The river itself has a lot of sand, and the sand and soil blown from the Mongolian Plateau every spring are washed into the riverbed by rainwater. Therefore, once a flood occurs, the tributaries flood and cause disasters. The Songhua River, which originates in the foothills of Changbai Mountain and flows into the Heilongjiang River, is also plagued by years of disasters because the water level of the Heilongjiang River is higher and the water of the Songhua River is not easy to flow in. According to years of investigation, the area of land affected by disasters in these two major water systems is about 15 million mu each year.

　　东北完成巨大水利工程
  　可增产粮食五十万吨
    【新华社沈阳二十日电】东北自今年三月至五月底止，完成辽河与松花江两大水系各支流两千八百四十四里的浩大水利工程，受益的土地面积共达一千二百万亩，可增产粮食五十万吨。该项工程包括辽河水系的东西辽河、浑河、太子河等及松花江水系的洮儿河、绰勒河、通肯河等十五条河流。其中又以辽东、辽西两省境内的东西辽河及太子河、海城河为重点，两省内已完成的治水工程达一千六百七十里，约占此次全东北治水工程的五分之三。据统计，东北行政委员会于春耕开始以来，先后投入水利的资金共粮食八万吨，占东北今年全部农业生产建设基金的一半。参加修建的民工共达十三万人，用工六百万个。共修补河堤一千九百十四里，挖排水渠九百二十里，挖土一千八百万立方米以上。这一工程完成后，去年各地因河水泛滥受灾的七百万亩涝地已变成良田，今年增开水田八十三万亩的任务亦因此顺利完成。现东北全境水田已达三百万亩，虽蒋伪满时日寇开发的三百二十万亩水田尚少二十万亩，但较日寇投降后初期的一百万亩（当时农民收回大批水田改为旱田）增加了两倍。
    东北今年下半年治水工作方针，经上月召开之首次水利会议确定为：巩固现有工程，并为明年春季治水工作做好准备，在目前夏汛期内，则以防汛为中心。历年东北各河流自七月初至八月底间，常因多雨而造成夏泛。据东北水利总局预测，今年辽河水系怡为洪水周期（前两个周期为一九二九年和一九三七年）。现辽东、辽西两省虽已修建了防水堤一千五百余里，情况已较以往为好，但仍需切实注意防范。松花江水系今年虽非洪水周期，但现有之四百里堤坝系今年新加修补，如不严防，亦可能发生危险。为此，东北水利总局特决定自七月一日至九月十日止订为防汛期，并具体制定防汛办法，责成各县执行。办法规定各县成立防汛委员会，由县长、农业科长任正副主任委员，划分防区，组织防汛工作大队。各地除在险要地带将各种器材备妥当外，应建立上下游防汛委员会的电话联系，以便随时互通情况，严密防范。
    东北所有河流概属于辽河与黑龙江两水系。辽河发源于热河省北部秃山中，河内本已多砂，加以每年春季自蒙古高原吹来砂土为雨水冲积河底，因之洪水一发，各支流即泛滥成灾。发源于长白山麓、流入黑龙江之松花江，则因黑龙江水位较高，松花江水不易流入，该水系亦连年为患。据历年调查，此两大水系每年受灾的土地面积均在一千五百万亩左右。
