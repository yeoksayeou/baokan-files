　　【Ping City News】Excerpts from the speeches by Lu Dingyi, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Xu Teli, Guo Moruo, Wu Yuzhang, Ma Xulun, Li Dequan, and others at the opening ceremony of the Preparatory Meeting for the First National Congress of Educational Workers:

　　Minister of Propaganda of the CPC Central Committee, Lu Dingyi, first stated in his speech that the people's democratic government attaches importance to culture and education. He explained in detail the difference between the New Democratic Revolution and the Old Democratic Revolution, and the difference between colonial education, semi-colonial and semi-feudal education in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and the New Democratic education in the liberated areas. After introducing the education situation and experience in the liberated areas, he said: "We must promote the New Democratic education implemented in the liberated areas to all parts of the country. We are determined to sweep away the remnants of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism! Our people's cultural and educational undertakings will surely have unlimited bright prospects."
　　Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "The object of the New Democratic education is mainly workers and peasants, including the masses of people from all revolutionary classes. In the future, the focus of Chinese education should be on popularizing and improving the scientific and cultural level of the workers and peasants." Shen Junru, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, reported on the characteristics of Mr. Tao Xingzhi, the great people's educator in China, who ran education by connecting it with reality and combining it with the masses of workers and peasants, calling on educators to learn from Mr. Tao. Xu Teli, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee and an old educator, explained from his own 50 years of experience in education and revolutionary work that educators can truly play the role of education and be supported by the people only by mastering Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. He called on educators to earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, emphasized: "Educators must educate workers, peasants, and the masses of people, and must stand on the position of the working class and the masses of people, and use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to conduct education. Educators must carry out self-education and transform their thinking." Wu Yuzhang, President of North China University, pointed out: The purpose of education is to promote social development. Educators must advance along the road of human social progress. He explained that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can defeat imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China because they can be supported by the broad masses of people. Educators must study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and educate the people with it, so that they can be loved by the people. Finally, he raised the issue of reforming Chinese characters, explaining that Chinese characters are too difficult for the masses of people to understand, and Chinese characters must be transformed into simple, modern, and progressive characters. Ma Xulun, Standing Director of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy and an old educator, said: "The Chinese people have stood up, and education should also have a great revolution." He believes that education that was divorced from the masses and divorced from practical life in the past should be reformed into education that is connected with the masses and not separated from practical life. Li Dequan, representative of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, made a clear comparison between the education in the Soviet Union she had witnessed, the bourgeois education in the United States, and the imperialist enslavement education in colonies and semi-colonies in her speech, saying: "China's education should learn from the Soviet Union and various New Democratic countries, and must never follow the declining path of American bourgeois education." She believes that in the future, China's education must implement the principle of democracy, and all ethnic groups and male and female citizens in the country should have the right to receive education equally.

　　陆定一等讲话摘要
    【平市讯】中华全国第一次教育工作者代表会议筹备会议开幕典礼中，陆定一、李济深、沈钧儒、徐特立、郭沫若、吴玉章、马叙伦、李德全等的讲话摘要：
    中共中央宣传部陆定一部长在讲话中首先说明人民民主政府是重视文化教育的。他详细地说明新民主主义革命与旧民主主义革命的区别，说明殖民地教育、国民党统治区的半殖民地半封建的教育与解放区的新民主主义教育的区别，他在介绍了解放区的教育情况和经验之后，说：“我们要把解放区所实行的新民主主义教育推行到全国各地去。我们有决心把帝国主义的、封建主义的、官僚资本主义的遗毒一扫而光！我们人民的文化教育事业一定有无限光明的前途。”
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深说：“新民主教育的对象是以工农为主，包括各革命阶层的人民大众在内，今后中国教育的重点应该是普及和提高工农大众的科学文化。”中国民主同盟中央常务委员沈钧儒报告了中国伟大的人民教育家陶行知先生办教育联系实际，结合工农群众的特点，号召教育工作者向陶先生学习。中共中央宣传部副部长老教育家徐特立从他本身五十年来从事教育工作和革命工作的经验说明，教育工作者只有掌握马列主义、毛泽东思想才能真正发挥教育的作用，为人民所拥护。他号召教育工作者认真学习马列主义、毛泽东思想。中华全国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若着重指出：“教育工作者要教育工农和人民大众，必须要站在工人阶级和人民大众的立场，用马列主义和毛泽东思想来进行教育。教育工作者要进行自我教育，改造思想。”华北大学校长吴玉章指出：教育的目的是在促进社会的发展。教育工作者要循着人类社会向前发展的大道前进。他说明马列主义、毛泽东思想在中国能战胜帝国主义、封建主义、和官僚资本主义，是由于它能得到广大人民的拥护。教育工作者要学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，以此教育人民，才能为人民所爱好。他最后提出改革汉字的问题，说明汉字对人民大众太难懂，中国文字必须改造成为简单化、现代化的进步的文字。中国民主促进会中央常务理事老教育家马叙伦说：“中国人民翻身了，教育也该跟着有一个大革命。”他认为过去脱离群众，脱离生活实践的教育，应该改革成为联系群众，和生活实践不分离的教育。中华全国民主妇联代表李德全在讲话中把她自己所目睹的苏联的教育，和美国的资产阶级教育，与殖民地、半殖民地的帝国主义奴化教育作了一个鲜明的对比，说：“中国的教育应该向苏联和各新民主国家学习，绝不能走美国资产阶级教育没落的道路。”她认为今后中国的教育必须贯彻民主的原则，国内各民族和男女公民都应有平等地受教育的权利。
