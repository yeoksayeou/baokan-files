　　Output of Some Departments Has Exceeded Pre-Liberation Levels
    [Another Dispatch] Since the liberation and resumption of production in the steel industry, the total number of employees in the factory has decreased compared to the Kuomintang era. However, due to increased labor efficiency, the current production volume has not only reached the level of the Kuomintang rule but has also exceeded it in some departments. For example, the current output of the two sets of coke ovens (fifty ovens) in the coking plant exceeds the Kuomintang era by 10% and the enemy-puppet period by 20%. The production of by-products such as asphalt increased by 60%, and light oil increased by 30% to 90%. In addition, two new products, carbolic acid and motor oil, have been added since liberation. The steel ingot mold castings produced by the foundry's sand casting department after liberation have a 100% yield, with no rejects. Its pipe casting department is the only machine pipe casting factory in Guannei and can cast various water pipes from three inches to one foot. It has officially started operation. The mechanical repair shop can now repair locomotives. (Jia Chi)

　　某些部门产量已超过解放前
    【又讯】钢铁各部门自解放后恢复生产以来，全厂职工人数虽比国民党时期减少；但由于劳动效率提高，目前生产量不但已达到国民党统治时期的水准，而且在某些部门已超过了国民党时期。例如炼焦厂目前所开之两组炼焦炉（五十只），产量比国民党时期超出百分之十，比敌伪时期超出百分之二十。其副产物如沥青增产百分之六十，轻油增产百分之三十到九十。此外，解放后还增加了石炭酸和汽车油两种产品。铸造厂翻砂部在解放后出产的钢锭模铸件，成品率百分之百，没有一件废品。其铸管部为关内唯一的机器铸管厂，可铸三英寸到一英尺的各种水管，一日已正式开工。机械修理厂现在已能修火车头。　　　（家炽）
