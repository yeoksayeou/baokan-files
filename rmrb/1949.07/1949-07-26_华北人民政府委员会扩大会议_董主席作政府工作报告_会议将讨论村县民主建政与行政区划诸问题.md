　　North China People's Government Committee Enlarged Meeting
  　Chairman Dong Delivers Government Work Report
    Meeting to Discuss Village and County Democratic Governance and Administrative Division Issues
    [Ping City News] The third enlarged meeting of the North China People's Government Committee began on July 25th. The meeting is expected to last three days. A total of more than 220 people are participating in the meeting, making it a grand gathering since the North China People's Government moved to Ping. The government committee members present included Dong Biwu, Nie Rongzhen, Bo Yibo, Teng Daiyuan, Xie Juezai, Fan Wenlan, Cheng Fangwu, Yang Xiufeng, Nan Hanchen, Rong Zihe, Ling Biying, Zhang Su, Chen Jinkun, Lan Gongwu, Yu Li, Xing Zhaotang, Xue Xun, Yin Xipeng, Jia Xinzai, Chao Zhefu, Liu Yuchen, and 21 others. Also participating were the heads of various departments of the North China People's Government, as well as Li Gengtao, Director of the Jidong Administrative Office; Dai Jinong, Deputy Director of the Jizhong Administrative Office; Han Zhey, Deputy Director of the Jiluyu Administrative Office; Lü Hongan, Director of the Taihang Administrative Office; Yang Zhirin, Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Government; Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of Beiping; Pei Lisheng, Mayor of Taiyuan; Zang Boping, Deputy Mayor of Shijiazhuang; and Xu Jianguo, Director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau. Observers included counselors of the North China People's Government and heads of various sections, offices, and bureaus of the Pingjin Municipal Governments.
    The meeting began at 8:30 a.m., starting with a brief report by Tao Xijin, Secretary-General of the North China People's Government, on the implementation of the resolutions of the previous meeting and the temporary meeting in April, as well as personnel appointments and removals by the North China People's Government during this period, which he submitted for ratification. Secretary-General Tao then outlined the expected agenda for the three-day meeting, which would primarily include reports on the political situation, cultural and educational work, financial and economic work, and political and legal work; reports and discussions on the suggestions of the North China Workers' Representative Conference, on democratic governance in villages and counties, on administrative divisions, and on changes to the organizational structure of the North China People's Government.
    The meeting then proceeded with Chairman Dong Biwu's report on the current situation and a general assessment of the government's work during this period. Chairman Dong first analyzed the international situation, pointing out the increasing strength of the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries, the growing consolidation of the world's people's forces for peace and democracy, the increasing progress of the struggle against imperialism and war, the approaching economic crisis in the imperialist camp, and the increasing contradictions among the imperialist countries. When discussing the domestic situation, Chairman Dong said: The People's Liberation War has achieved a basic victory and is moving towards nationwide victory. The New Political Consultative Conference is about to convene, and the people's democratic coalition government will soon be established. This is the hope of the people of the whole country, and this is what we will do. Chairman Dong used concrete examples to illustrate that although the people's democratic government also has difficulties, these are surmountable and temporary. The power of the people can solve problems that people consider intractable, such as the issues of beggars, peddlers, and garbage dumps in the cities. The Kuomintang government was never able to handle these issues well, but we have resolved them quickly and satisfactorily.
    Regarding the government's work, Chairman Dong pointed out that in general, there have been achievements, especially in agricultural production, support for the war, disaster relief and flood prevention, and rectifying the political atmosphere. At the same time, he pointed out that shortcomings are manifested in a certain degree of bureaucratic tendencies and political paralysis. For example, the explosions, fires, and sabotage incidents that have occurred in many places have caused serious damage to state property. Another serious shortcoming is that not enough effort has been put into the work of democratic governance. This is a serious shortcoming, because the basic principle of building a revolutionary government is to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses. Finally, Chairman Dong summarized the government's work during this period, pointing out the following three advantages: First, our focus has shifted to the cities, but we do not neglect the countryside. For example, the work proposed at the temporary meeting in April, such as economic crops, solving the spring famine, preventing drought and rushing planting, supporting the front lines, democratic governance, and social security, all focused on the countryside. In addition, after entering the cities, government workers have maintained the simple style of the past in the countryside. Second, North China has begun to engage in peaceful construction, but it has not relaxed its attention to and support for the war. Third, since the last temporary committee meeting, in order to adapt to the development of the situation, the North China People's Government has actively participated in the preparation for the establishment of a new central government. The staff of the North China People's Government is welcoming the birth of the new central government with joy and excitement and with intense work, without relaxing and waiting.
    After Chairman Dong's report, the meeting continued with specialized reports on cultural and educational work, financial and economic work, and political and legal work.

　　华北人民政府委员会扩大会议
  　董主席作政府工作报告
    会议将讨论村县民主建政与行政区划诸问题
    【平市讯】华北人民政府第三次政府委员会扩大会议，于七月二十五日开始举行。会议预计开三天。参加会议的共有二百二十余人，这是华北人民政府移平后一次盛大的集会。出席的政府委员，有董必武、聂荣臻、薄一波、滕代远、谢觉哉、范文澜、成仿吾、杨秀峰、南汉宸、戎子和、凌必应、张苏、陈瑾昆、蓝公武、于力、邢肇棠、薛迅、殷希彭、贾心斋、晁哲甫、刘雨辰等二十一人。参加的有华北人民政府各部门负责人及冀东行署主任李耕涛、冀中行署副主任戴季农、冀鲁豫行署副主任韩哲一、太行行署主任吕鸿安、绥远省政府主席杨植霖、北平市副市长张友渔、太原市长裴丽生、石家庄市副市长臧伯平、天津市公安局局长许建国等。列席的有华北人民政府参议及各部门与平津两市府的各处、室、局负责人。
    会议于上午八时半开始，首由华北人民政府秘书长陶希晋简略报告上次会议及四月临时会议的决议执行情形以及华北人民政府这一时期的人事任免，提请追认。陶秘书长继提出此次会议预计进行三天，主要内容有关于政治形势及文教、财经、政法工作等报告；关于华北职工代表会议建议事项，关于村县民主建政，关于行政区划及华北人民政府组织机构的变更诸问题的报告和讨论。
    会议继由董必武主席作关于目前形势的报告及对这一时期政府工作作总的估计。董主席首先对国际形势做了分析，指出了苏联和各新民主国家的日见强盛，世界人民和平民主力量团结的日见巩固，反帝国主义反战争的斗争日见进展，以及帝国主义阵营经济危机的日见逼近，和各帝国主义国家相互间矛盾的日见扩大。董主席在谈到国内形势时说：人民解放战争，已取得了基本的胜利，正在取得全国胜利。新政治协商会议快要召开，人民民主联合政府很快就要成立。这是全国人民的希望，我们就要这样做。董主席用具体的例子说明人民民主政权虽然也有困难，但这是可以克服的暂时的困难。人民的力量可以解决被人们认为束手无策的难题，比如城市里的乞丐、摊贩、垃圾堆等问题，这是国民党政府始终办不好的，但我们把这些问题迅速地完满地解决了。
    对于政府工作，董主席指出一般是有成绩的，特别是这一时期在农业生产、支援战争、救灾防汛及整饬政风等，均有显著成绩。同时他又指出主席缺点表现在某种程度的官僚主义倾向和政治麻痹性，例如不少地方所发生的爆炸、失火、破坏事件，造成对国家财产的严重损失。另一个严重缺点是对民主建政工作没有用足够力量去进行。这是一个严重缺点。因为革命政权建设的基本原则，就是动员人民群众，依靠人民群众。最后，董主席归纳政府这一时期的工作，指出以下三个优点：一、我们的工作重心转到城市，但并不忽视农村。如四月临时会议所提出的经济作物，解决春荒，防旱抢种，支援前线，民主建政以及社会治安等工作，都是着重农村的表现。此外，政府工作人员进入城市以后，仍然保持了过去农村的朴素作风。二、华北开始着手和平建设，但并不放松对战争的注意与支援。三、上次临时委员会后，为着适应形势的发展，华北人民政府积极参加了准备成立新中央政府的工作，华北人民政府工作人员，是以欢欣鼓舞的心情和紧张的工作，来迎接新中央政府的诞生，而没有放松等待的现象。
    董主席报告完毕后，会议继续进行文教、财经、政法诸工作的专门报告。
