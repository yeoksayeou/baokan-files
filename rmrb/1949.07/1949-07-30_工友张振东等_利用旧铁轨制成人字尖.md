Workers Zhang Zhendong and Others
　　Use Old Rails to Make Frog Points
【Taiyuan News】Worker Zhang Zhendong and others at Jiexiu Station of the Tongpu Railway were rewarded for their successful trial production of "frog points" from old rails. According to this material, all locomotive depots along the Tongpu Railway have been unable to produce them. On December 13th of last year, Comrade Zhang Zhendong of the Jiexiu Works Section discovered that the "frog point" (frog component) of the "second track" at the station was bent and broken for a length of 300 meters, making train operation very dangerous. At that time, due to his increased awareness, he believed, "If my train has an accident, I will be the least honorable!" So he discussed it with workers Liang Wuba and Ren Yuanlong, intending to take two old rails and remake a "frog point." They started work that day. According to the past principle, the two rails for making the "frog point" must be joined head-to-head, but after repeated study by the three of them, for the sake of strength and durability, they changed it to a "single-rail point" style. This also made the length of the rails different from the past: in the past, the left and right rails were both 1.560 meters long, but this time the shorter left rail was sawed to 1.350 meters, and the longer right rail remained at the original length of 1.560 meters. In addition, the position of drilling holes and screwing in screws was also different from the past. In the past, the "eyes" of the "frog point" were drilled in front of the front and rear "iron bricks," but now the "eyes" are drilled in the middle of the two "iron bricks," and the stability of the track is no different from the past, and the train runs smoothly. On December 25, 1948, they successfully modified the first finished product - a No. 10 frog point - weighing 16 kilograms. On March 3rd, the local Railway Administration specially awarded the three comrades 50,000 Jiao (冀钞, a currency) to encourage them.

　　工友张振东等
  　利用旧铁轨制成人字尖
    【太原讯】同蒲路介休站工友张振东等以旧铁轨试制“辙叉”机件“人字尖”成功获奖。按该项材料，同蒲全路各机务段一向不能制作。去年十二月十三日，介休工务段张振东同志，发现站上“二股道”的“人字尖”（辙叉机件）压折了三百米突长，行车非常危险。当时由于他的觉悟提高，认为：“使自己火车出了事故，首先自己是最不光荣的！”于是和工友梁五八、任元龙商议，打算拿旧铁轨两条，另行改作一“人字尖”。当天他们便动开工。要按过去原理，制作“人字尖”的两条铁轨，必须是两尖齐头并合，经他们三个人反复研究后，为了结实、耐用，改成“独股尖”式。这也就使铁条的长度和过去有了区别：以往左右两铁条皆长为一·五六○米突，这次左短者锯成一·三五○米突，右长者仍保持原先长度一·五六○。此外在打眼、上螺丝钉时，位置也和过去不同了。以往“人字尖”的“眼”，是打在前后两块“铁砖”的前面，现在“眼”打在了两“铁砖”中间，铁道稳定程度，亦与过去无异，行车畅通无阻。一九四八年十二月二十五日他们改作成功了第一个成品——十号辙叉人字尖——计重十六公斤。该地铁路管理局于三月三日特奖给该三同志冀钞五万元，以资鼓励。
