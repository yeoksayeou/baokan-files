Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: According to TASS, Sofia: Dimitrov's hearse arrived safely in Sofia on the 6th. Countless people flocked to the central railway station, where black-bordered national flags flew at half-mast. A giant flag bore the golden inscription: "Dimitrov's lifelong cause and will live forever in the hearts of millions of working people."

	A guard of honor was lined up on the station platform. After the hearse entered the station, Bulgarian Communist leaders Chervenkov, Zhankov, Yugov, Terbishev, Damyanov, and Poptomov carried Dimitrov's coffin onto a gun carriage in the square in front of the railway station. The welcoming procession slowly proceeded along the tree-lined avenue towards the city center. Behind the coffin walked, with hats removed, the leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government, personnel of the Soviet government delegation headed by Voroshilov, delegations of working people from Moscow, Leningrad, and Ukraine, the Romanian government delegation, representatives of mass organizations, factories and manufacturing plants, as well as members of the diplomatic corps and hundreds of thousands of Sofia's working people.

	Leading the welcoming procession was a flag team, followed by people holding many wreaths, with the wreath presented by Stalin at the head. In front of the coffin was a velvet screen on which hung the Order of Lenin, Bulgarian Order, and other decorations awarded to Dimitrov. Approximately 500,000 working people took to the streets and squares to bid farewell to their beloved teacher and leader. Deep grief was evident on their faces, and many were in tears. The welcoming procession stopped at the square of the People's Assembly, where Chervenkov, Zhankov, Yugov, Damyanov, Poptomov, and Nechev carried the coffin down from the gun carriage and into the hall of the People's Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: TASS reports: The working people of the world continue to mourn Dimitrov. At memorial services held throughout Bulgaria, the working people expressed infinite grief over Dimitrov's death and vowed to realize the legacy of their teacher and leader, Dimitrov. Employees of the Plovdiv Tobacco Company held a mass meeting on the 6th, at which they observed a minute of silence for Dimitrov and passed a resolution stating: The employees of the Plovdiv tobacco industry will forever be loyal to Dimitrov's legacy, unite more closely around the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and work wholeheartedly for the construction of socialism. All employees of the "May Day" factory in Fana passed a resolution guaranteeing to complete the five-year plan in four and a half years, improve product quality, and tirelessly strengthen the alliance between the working class and the working peasantry.

On the 4th and 5th, Italian Communist Party members of parliament delivered speeches in the Lower and Upper Houses commemorating Dimitrov's death. The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party dispatched representatives Longo, Secchia, and others to Sofia on the 7th to attend Dimitrov's funeral.
