    Wang Zhenyuan of Shijiazhuang Flour Mill No. 2
    Successfully Renovates Wheat Cleaning Machine
    Wang Zhenyuan, a technician at Shijiazhuang Yumin Industrial Company's Flour Mill No. 2, has successfully renovated the wheat cleaning machine, which can reduce the waste of wheat by 4,500 jin per month. The mill's wheat cleaning machine had been in use for over twenty years, and the internal parts were almost entirely replacements, so it often produced broken wheat. Before liberation, it produced about 6,000 to 7,000 jin of broken wheat per month. After liberation, through repeated repairs by workers, this was reduced to 4,500 jin. The main reason was that the design was too old. The air drum scraper used one shaft, with only a four-fen-thick wooden board in between. As soon as the wooden board was broken by the wheat, the wheat would continuously enter the air drum and be broken by the fan blades. In addition, the scraper rotated too fast and hit with too much force, which also easily broke the wheat. If a larger pulley was used to reduce the scraper's rotation speed, the air power would not be enough to scrape out the soil, wheat bran, and wheat hairs, affecting the quality of the flour. After the competition began, technician Wang Zhenyuan carefully studied the machine, saw through its problems. Although he encountered many difficulties during the renovation, he was not discouraged. He repeatedly visited Mill No. 1 to see the new wheat cleaning machines, came up with a solution, separating the scraper and the air drum, installing the air drum with a small shaft on the upper left of the scraper shaft, moving the air duct from the bottom to the top, and adding a pulley on the scraper shaft to drive the air drum. This way, the wheat would no longer enter the air drum. He also reduced the size of the fan blades, narrowed the air duct, and increased the rotation speed by 100 revolutions (originally 800 revolutions), naturally increasing the air power. The original pulley on the scraper was enlarged, reducing the rotation speed by 200 revolutions (originally 800 revolutions), thus reducing the friction when the wheat passed through the scraper and increasing the suction of the air. After the plan was approved by the administration, the wheat cleaning machine was successfully renovated in five or six days. After a month of testing in May, it no longer produced broken wheat.

    石市面粉二厂王振元
    改造净麦机成功
    石家庄裕民实业公司面粉二厂技工王振元，改造净麦机试验成功，每月可减少浪费小麦四千五百斤。该厂净麦机使用了二十余年，内部零件几乎完全是配制的，所以老出碎麦子，解放前每月约出碎麦子六、七千斤。解放后经工人一再修理，曾减至四千五百斤。主要原因是样式太老，风鼓刮刀用着一根轴，中间只隔着一层四分厚木板。只要木板被麦子打破一点，麦子就不断的进入风鼓里，被风扇叶子打碎了，再加上刮刀转数太快，打力太大，亦容易将麦子打碎，如果换个大皮带轮，将刮刀转数减少，风力便不够用，刮刀打出土、麦糠、麦毛，风鼓就吸不出去，影响面粉的质量。竞赛开始后技工王振元经过细心研究，看透了机器的毛病，在改造中虽遇到很多困难，但都没有使他低头。反复到一厂参观新式净麦机，想出了办法，把刮刀和风鼓分开，把风鼓另用一根小轴装在刮刀轴的左上方，风道由下部移到上部，再添一个皮带轮装在刮刀轴上，带动风鼓，这样麦子再也进不到风鼓里去，并把风扇叶子缩小，风道缩细，转数加快一百转（原八百转），风力自然就大了，把刮刀上原来皮带轮加大，转数减少二百转（原八百转），这样麦子通过刮刀时摩擦减少，风的吸力加大。经行政批准这个计划后，五、六天的工夫一部净麦机改造成功了，经过五月份一个月的试验，不再出碎麦子了。
