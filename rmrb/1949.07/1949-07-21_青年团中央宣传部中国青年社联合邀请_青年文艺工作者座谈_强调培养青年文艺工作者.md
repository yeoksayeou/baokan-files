The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League Propaganda Department and China Youth Press Jointly Invite Young Literary and Art Workers to a Forum
Emphasizing the Training of Young Literary and Art Workers
[Our Newspaper] The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the "China Youth Press" jointly invited young literary and art workers attending the Literary and Art Congress yesterday (20th) to discuss how to educate young people through literature and art and how to train young literary and art workers. Those present included Ma Fanto, Liu Qing (author of "Record of Planting Grain"), Luo Binji, Ma Feng, Chen Miao (author of "Red Flag Song"), Fan Zheng, and more than twenty literary and art workers from the troops. Everyone spoke enthusiastically at the meeting, pointing out the close connection between young people and literature and art, as well as the tremendous educational role that literature and art plays in young people. Everyone believes that in the future, literature and art should reflect the lives of young people more, mainly reflecting the stories of production models, combat heroes, and model members of the Communist Youth League among young workers, peasants, and soldiers, using their love for the motherland, love for the working people, heroic deeds in production and war and various work positions, and patriotism and internationalism to educate, enlighten, and encourage the vast number of young people in China. Everyone proposed: It is very important to train young literary and art workers, and young people should be cultivated, assisted, and guided to engage in writing in a planned way. The editors of "China Youth Press" reported that since the publication of "China Youth" last December, the circulation has increased from 7,000 copies to 150,000 copies, making it the youth publication with the widest circulation in the country. The literary and art workers present also reflected that the publication has been welcomed and loved by the vast number of young people in various regions, and put forward many specific suggestions for improvement of the publication.

    强调培养青年文艺工作者
    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会宣传部与“中国青年社”于昨（二十）日联合邀请参加文代会的青年文艺工作者，座谈如何以文艺教育青年及如何培养青年文艺工作者的问题。到会有马凡陀、柳青（“种谷记”作者）、骆宾基、马烽、陈淼（“红旗歌”作者）、范政及部队文艺工作者二十余人。大家在会上热烈发言，都指出青年与文艺的密切关联性，以及文艺对于青年所起的巨大教育作用。大家认为今后文艺应多多反映青年生活，主要应反映青年工农兵中的生产模范、战斗英雄和模范青年团员的故事，以他们热爱祖国，热爱劳动人民，在生产和战争中及各种工作岗位上的英勇行为及爱国主义、国际主义的精神，来教育、启发和鼓舞中国广大的青年。大家提出：培养青年文艺工作者是很重要的，应该有计划地培养、协助、指导青年从事写作。“中国青年社”编辑同志报告了“中国青年”自去年十二月出版以来，发行数字自七千份增至十五万份，为目前国内发行期刊销路最广的青年刊物。到会文艺工作者也纷纷反映该刊物在各地区已受到广大青年的欢迎与热爱，并对于该刊提出许多具体的改进意见。
