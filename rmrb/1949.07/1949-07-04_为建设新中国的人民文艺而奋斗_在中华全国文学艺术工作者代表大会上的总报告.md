Comrades Delegates:

The Congress Preparatory Committee has asked me to give a general report. In this report, I only intend to explain the nature of our literary and artistic movement and the united front of literary and artistic circles, and to propose the tasks of national literary and artistic work in the future for your discussion.

We often like to say "the new literature and art since the May Fourth Movement." Where exactly is this new literature and art since the May Fourth Movement new? What are the differences in nature from the previous literature and art?

For a considerable period of time, those of us engaged in literary and artistic work did not understand this issue clearly or completely. It was not until Chairman Mao Zedong's "On New Democracy" was published that this issue received the most scientific explanation. In that famous work, Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out that the nature of the Chinese revolution at this stage is a new democratic revolution. He summarized the characteristics of the new democratic revolution in the simplest terms, that is, "a revolution against imperialism and feudalism led by the proletariat and the broad masses of the people." This nature of the Chinese revolution determines the nature of China's new culture and new literature and art. That is to say, the new culture after the May Fourth Movement is no longer the outdated old democratic culture, but the new democratic culture against imperialism and feudalism led by the proletariat and the broad masses of the people; the new literature and art after the May Fourth Movement is no longer the outdated old democratic literature and art, but the new democratic literature and art against imperialism and feudalism led by the proletariat and the broad masses of the people. This is what is new about the new literature and art since the May Fourth Movement. This is the difference in nature between the new literature and art since the May Fourth Movement and the previous literature and art.

The tasks of the Chinese revolution against imperialism and feudalism are prescribed by the nature of Chinese society for more than a hundred years. Since the Opium War, the old democratic political movement and the old democratic cultural and literary movements in China have been anti-imperialist and anti-feudal to varying degrees. Therefore, in the characteristics of the new democracy mentioned by Chairman Mao Zedong, that is, in the characteristics of "the people's revolution against imperialism and feudalism led by the proletariat", the leadership of the proletariat is the most fundamental characteristic. Without the leadership of the most revolutionary proletariat, without the leadership of the most scientific proletarian ideology, it would be impossible to correctly define the direction and policies of the revolution, it would be impossible to fully mobilize the power of the people, and it would be impossible to achieve the victory of the Chinese revolution. This is the case in political revolution, and it is also the case in cultural revolution and literary and artistic revolution. This most important truth has been repeatedly proven by the history of China over the past thirty years. The great victories in political revolution and cultural revolution and literary revolution that the Chinese people have achieved today are inseparable from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought. The reason why the political revolution and the cultural and literary revolution since the May Fourth Movement have had the thoroughness and uncompromising nature that has never existed in Chinese history is also due to the leadership of the proletariat.

The oppression of imperialism and feudalism enables the broad masses of the Chinese people to participate in the new democratic revolution. Therefore, how the leadership of the proletariat organizes this broad mass of people into a united front is one of the most important issues in the revolution. Without a broad united front, without a correct united front policy, it would be impossible to unite the strength of the whole country, it would be impossible to defeat the enemy, and it would be equally impossible to achieve the victory of the Chinese revolution. This is the case in political revolution, and it is also the case in cultural revolution and literary and artistic revolution. This important truth has also been repeatedly proven by the history of China over the past thirty years.

The new literary and artistic movement of the past thirty years has mainly been a united front literary and artistic movement. This literary and artistic movement was initially a united front jointly formed by intellectuals with preliminary communist ideas, petty-bourgeois intellectuals, and bourgeois intellectuals. From the May Fourth Movement to the First Great Revolution, it destroyed the rule of feudal and semi-feudal old literature and art, and established a new literature and art with anti-imperialist and anti-feudal content. Writers with communist ideas and revolutionary petty-bourgeois writers who later gradually moved towards communism produced some representative works of this period. These works had a universal impact among intellectuals and played a great role in anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. After the failure of the First Great Revolution, the Chinese right-wing bourgeoisie betrayed the revolution, and the Chinese revolution entered a new period. In the field of literature and art, the left-wing literary and artistic movement emerged. The left-wing literary and artistic movement was a united front literary and artistic movement led by the proletariat, consisting of proletarian intellectuals and revolutionary petty-bourgeois intellectuals. Led by Lu Xun, this movement waged many heroic struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, influenced the broad masses of petty-bourgeois intellectuals and young students to move towards revolution, and trained a large number of revolutionary literary and artistic cadres. Overall, it made great contributions to the Chinese revolution. In this movement, some literary and artistic workers adopted narrow closed-doorist erroneous views on the united front issue. Around the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese literary and artistic circles formed a broad united front led by the proletariat under the common goal of resisting Japan. This united front included proletarian literary and artists, petty-bourgeois literary and artists, bourgeois literary and artists, and all other patriotic new and old literary and artistic figures. Although in this united front, some people at certain stages neglected the principled struggle and serious criticism within the united front, and produced right-leaning deviations, on the whole, the new democratic literary and artistic movement during the War of Resistance Against Japan developed forward and made considerable contributions to the War of Resistance Against Japan and the democratic movement. In the last two or three years, the mainstream direction of the movement has seen even more important developments and achievements. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, literary and artistic workers persisted in their work under all kinds of oppression. In the end, this literary and artistic army was not defeated, and it produced some works with strong political significance that struggled against the Kuomintang reactionaries, and began some efforts to combine with the masses of people under the influence of Mao Zedong's new direction for literature and art. In the liberated areas, due to the fundamental difference in objective conditions, due to the direct education under Mao Zedong Thought, and due to the active study and work of many literary and artistic workers, since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942, problems that had not been resolved since the May Fourth Movement have been solved theoretically and practically. Literature and art began to truly combine with the broad masses of the people, began to truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers first, and underwent great changes in both content and form. This is the basic situation of the literary and artistic united front over the past thirty years. This is also a brief account of the achievements and victories achieved by the literary and artistic united front over the past thirty years.

Over the past thirty years, apart from the feudal literature and art representing the landlord class, which has been theoretically disarmed, and the Kuomintang fascist literature and art representing the big bourgeoisie, which has always been despised by the national literary and artistic circles and the people of the whole country, the main controversy in the Chinese literary and artistic circles exists between two lines: one is the so-called art-for-art's-sake line representing the weak liberal bourgeoisie, and the other is the art-for-the-people line representing the proletariat and other revolutionary people. The result of the struggle over the past thirty years is that the art-for-art's-sake literary theory under the influence of the decadent bourgeois literature and art in Europe and the United States has completely gone bankrupt, and the art-for-art's-sake literary works have also lost the masses. Many writers and artists who were once influenced by this art-for-art's-sake bourgeois literary thought have gradually changed their outlook on life and art, and accepted the leadership of proletarian literary thought. The literature and art serving the people under the leadership of proletarian literary thought has grown stronger, its direction has become clearer, and it has therefore been increasingly welcomed and supported by the broad masses of the people. Such historical facts show that although the Chinese bourgeoisie also wanted to strive for leadership in literature and art, they could not achieve it because they could not combine with the people. Such historical facts show that if any literary and artistic worker does not accept the leadership of the proletariat, his efforts will be fruitless. This profoundly illustrates the new democratic nature of the Chinese literary and artistic movement over the past thirty years. Chairman Mao Zedong said in "On New Democracy": "Before the May Fourth Movement, China's new cultural movement, China's cultural revolution, was led by the bourgeoisie, and they still had a leading role. After the May Fourth Movement, the cultural thought of this class was even more backward than its political things, and there was absolutely no leading role. At most, it played the role of an ally to a certain extent during the revolutionary period. As for the qualifications of the leader, it had to fall on the shoulders of proletarian cultural thought." Indeed, "This is an iron fact that no one can deny."

All literary and artistic workers who seriously want to achieve something in literature and art must remember this important lesson from the history of Chinese literature and art over the past thirty years. Now, the victory of the great Chinese revolution has shaken all the people who have not been involved in the revolution in the past. This makes it possible for the literary and artistic united front to gain a broader foundation than in the past. Chairman Mao Zedong recently said at the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference: "The Chinese revolution is a revolution of the entire nation and the masses of the people. Except for imperialists, feudalists, bureaucrat-capitalists, Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices, all other people are our friends. We have a broad and consolidated revolutionary united front. This united front is so broad that it includes the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie." The same is true of the united front of literary and artistic circles. Literary and artistic workers should first unite politically within the scope mentioned by Chairman Mao Zedong. In literature and art, as in politics, there are different classes in the united front, so there are naturally different artistic viewpoints. These different viewpoints cannot be unified all at once. Therefore, we tolerate the existence of these different viewpoints, but in addition to uniting politically first, we also hope to unite on the position of literature and art serving the people. We hope that through criticism and self-criticism in the literary and artistic circles, and through the efforts of the literary and artistic workers themselves, we can fully achieve the common goal of literature and art serving the people. In literary and artistic circles, as in politics, the united front cannot be consolidated if there is only unity and no criticism. There should be a healthy democratic style in the literary and artistic circles. The unhealthy trend of allowing oneself to criticize anyone but not allowing anyone to criticize oneself is a manifestation of despotism and should not be adopted by our thoughtful literary and artistic workers.

Comrades Delegates: The convening of this unprecedentedly grand and united representative meeting reflects the victory of the Chinese people's political revolution, and also reflects the victory of the Chinese people's cultural revolution and literary and artistic revolution. Under the strong and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, after experiencing a long and cruel armed struggle and other forms of struggle, have finally achieved a great victory throughout the country. The remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries will soon be completely eliminated. The new Political Consultative Conference is being prepared. A national democratic coalition government is about to be established. The Chinese revolution is about to begin a new historical period of extensively engaging in political construction, economic construction, cultural construction, and national defense construction. At such a time, we are holding such a representative meeting. At this meeting, the representatives of patriotic and democratic literary and artistic workers from all fields are attending. At this meeting, we look back on the past and look forward to the future, and we cannot but consider the current tasks of our literary and artistic workers and how this broad literary and artistic united front should strengthen its organization in the future so that we can fight together. This is what needs to be discussed and stipulated at this meeting. In order to arouse discussion among all of you, I will start the ball rolling based on my above understanding of the nature of China's new literature and art and the united front of literary and artistic circles, and first propose the specific tasks of our literary and artistic workers in the future. Please consider:

1. We must strengthen unity, and together with the people of the whole country, strive to completely overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, build a new democratic people's republic, and strive to use the weapons of literature and art to accelerate this struggle and construction.

2. We must delve into reality, express and praise the diligence and heroism of the masses of the people, create people's literature and art that is rich in ideological content and moral qualities and is loved by the masses of the people, so that literature and art can exert the great effect of educating the people. We should pay attention to developing mass literary and artistic activities in factories, rural areas, and troops, and cultivate new literary and artistic forces among the masses.

3. We must eliminate the remaining forces of semi-colonial and semi-feudal old literature and art, and oppose the influence of the literature and art of the bourgeois and Chinese feudalism in the imperialist countries within the new literary and artistic circles. We must critically accept all literary and artistic heritage, develop all excellent and progressive traditions, and fully absorb the valuable experience of the socialist country of the Soviet Union, so as to make patriotism and internationalism organically linked.

Comrades Delegates, our literary and artistic movement has always had a valuable tradition of combining with the political movement. Since the May Fourth Movement, in various historical periods, the mainstream of the Chinese new literary and artistic movement has been an important combat unit of the revolutionary political movement at that time. In order to achieve the victory of the new democratic political revolution and the literary and artistic revolution, many literary and artistic workers have sacrificed their blood and lives together with the heroic Chinese people. During the land revolution, some left-wing writers and artists were killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, more literary and artistic workers sacrificed on the battlefield, sacrificed in prisons, and sacrificed at the hands of secret agents. We should inherit their spirit of selflessness to participate in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capital, and to participate in the construction of a new China.

Our profession is literary and artistic work. We should certainly participate in revolutionary struggles and construction with political actions, but we should mainly participate with our literary and artistic work. The Chinese new literary and artistic movement over the past thirty years, in terms of its social status, in terms of its influence among the broad progressive masses, and in terms of its contribution to the Chinese revolution, has undoubtedly achieved a great victory. However, compared with the rich and brilliant struggles and creations of the Chinese people over the past thirty years, and compared with the demands of the broad Chinese people for literature and art, the achievements of the new literature and art are still very disproportionate. In order to better reflect the people's struggles and creations, and to meet the people's demands, our literary and artistic workers must delve into reality and strengthen learning. The lives of the masses of the people are an inexhaustible source for all literary and artistic workers. We must understand and be familiar with the masses of the people before we can reflect the masses of the people. We must first be students of the masses of the people before we can be teachers of the masses of the people. Therefore, delving into reality is what all creators should strive for first. Secondly, contacting reality does not necessarily mean fully understanding reality. Today's Chinese society is in a great and drastic change. The reality we face is much more complicated than the reality faced by past literary and artistic workers, and we must adopt a very different serious and responsible attitude towards readers, audiences, and listeners than past literary and artistic workers. Therefore, learning revolutionary theories and policies, and learning progressive literary theories, is very necessary for us. Only through this kind of learning can we correctly and profoundly understand reality, and can we improve the ideological content of our literary and artistic works. The artistic quality of our literary and artistic works also needs to be improved, and needs to be improved on the basis of popularization under the correct direction. To improve artistic quality, we must critically accept the Chinese and foreign literary and artistic heritage, absorb those things that are suitable for expressing the people and are easily accepted by the people, and discard those things that are the opposite. In short, whether for the Chinese literary and artistic heritage or for the foreign literary and artistic heritage, we should not blindly despise and exclude them; nor should we blindly worship and copy them.

In addition to these efforts, there is another important fact that we should not ignore, that is, various semi-colonial and semi-feudal old literature and art, as well as the feudal literature and art that has remained unchanged, still occupy a large territory among the backward masses. We should take the responsibility of seizing the position of this reactionary literature and art as our responsibility. We should take various effective methods to fulfill this responsibility. The work done by literary and artistic workers in the liberated areas to transform the old rural literature and art and to transform the old rural artists is one of the effective methods. Within the new literary and artistic circles, it is also undeniable that the influence of the literature and art of the bourgeois and Chinese feudalism in the imperialist countries still exists. We should use the method of criticism and self-criticism to completely eliminate it. We must eliminate these old literature and art and old influences from both the outside and inside of the new literary and artistic movement. We should also actively pay attention to developing mass literary and artistic activities in factories, rural areas, and troops. All of these are for the sake of the new literature and art can develop more healthily, can more widely combine with the people, and can better serve the people. The main shortcoming of the new literature and art since the May Fourth Movement is that it has not combined enough with the masses of the people. Comrades Delegates! If we could say in the past that this shortcoming and other shortcomings of our literary and artistic work were mainly due to the limitations of objective conditions, then now it should be said that everything is ready, except for the east wind. This east wind is the efforts of our literary and artistic workers themselves. We should create literary and artistic works that are worthy of our great nation, and we should satisfy the demands of the broad Chinese people for literature and art.

Comrades Delegates, our tasks are heavy, but we already have a clear direction and have many important and successful experiences. And the most important experience among these experiences is that our literary and artistic workers themselves must go through various different ways to combine with the masses of the people. This should become a conscious movement of literary and artistic workers. Literary and artistic workers who have already initially combined with the masses of the people should remember the many instructions of Chairman Mao Zedong, and do not be proud and complacent. Literary and artistic workers who have not yet combined with the masses of the people should have sufficient understanding and determination, and strive to combine with the masses of the people, and do not regard it as a daunting task. With a humble attitude, diligent study and work, and the help of leadership, we believe that we can complete the historical task of our generation of literary and artistic intellectuals, and can do literary and artistic work that is welcomed by the people and can educate the people!

All anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucrat-capital literary and artistic workers unite, and strive to completely complete the new democratic political revolution! Strive to completely complete the new democratic cultural revolution and literary revolution!

Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!
Long live the victory of the people's literature and art!
Long live the great people's leader and mentor of the people's literature and art, Chairman Mao!

### 为建设新中国的人民文艺而奋斗——在中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会上的总报告

　　为建设新中国的人民文艺而奋斗
    ——在中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会上的总报告各位代表：
    郭沫若
    大会筹备委员会要我来作一个总的报告。在这个报告里，我只打算说明一下我们的文艺运动的性质和文艺界的统一战线问题，并提出今后全国文艺工作的任务，请大家讨论。
    我们常常喜欢说“五四以来的新文艺”。这个五四以来的新文艺到底新在那里？和以前的文艺有什么性质上的不同？
    这个问题，曾经在一个相当长的时间里，我们从事文学艺术工作的人是了解得并不明确或者并不完全的。这个问题，到了毛泽东主席的“新民主主义论”发表以后，才得到了最科学的说明。在那部名著里面，毛泽东主席指出现阶段中国革命的性质是新民主主义的革命。他用最简单的话概括了新民主主义革命的特点，就是“无产阶级领导的人民大众反帝反封建的革命”。中国革命的这种性质就决定了中国的新文化和新文艺的性质。这就是说，五四运动以后的新文化已经不是过时的旧民主主义的文化，而是无产阶级领导的人民大众反帝反封建的新民主主义的文化；五四运动以后的新文艺已经不是过时的旧民主主义的文艺，而是无产阶级领导的人民大众反帝反封建的新民主主义的文艺。这就是五四以来的新文艺的新的地方。这就是五四以来的新文艺和以前的文艺在性质上的区别。
    中国革命的反帝反封建的任务是一百多年来中国社会的性质所规定的。从鸦片战争以来，中国旧民主主义的政治运动和旧民主主义的文化运动文艺运动都是在不同程度上反帝反封建。因此，在毛泽东主席所说的新民主主义的特点中，就是在“无产阶级领导的人民大众反帝反封建”这样的特点中，无产阶级领导又是最根本的特点。没有最革命的无产阶级的领导，没有最科学的无产阶级思想的领导，就不可能正确地规定革命的方向和政策，就不可能充分地发挥人民群众的力量，就不可能取得中国革命的胜利。在政治革命上是这样，在文化革命和文艺革命上也是这样。这一条最重要的真理已经为中国三十年来的历史所反复证明。中国人民在今天所已经取得的伟大的政治革命的胜利和文化革命文艺革命的胜利，都是和中国共产党的领导，和毛泽东思想的领导不可分开的。五四以来的政治革命和文化革命文艺革命为什么有着中国历史上所不曾有过的彻底性和不妥协性，也就是由于有了无产阶级的领导的缘故。
    帝国主义和封建主义的压迫使广大的中国人民大众能够参加新民主主义革命。因此，无产阶级的领导如何把这广泛的人民大众组成统一战线，这是革命中最重要的问题之一。没有广泛的统一战线，没有正确的统一战线政策，就不可能团结全国的力量，就不可能打倒敌人，就同样地不可能取得中国革命的胜利。在政治革命上是这样，在文化革命和文艺革命上也是这样。这一条重要的真理也同样地已经为中国三十年来的历史所反复证明。
    三十年来的新文艺运动主要是统一战线的文艺运动。这个文艺运动在初期就是由具有初步共产主义思想的知识分子，小资产阶级知识分子和资产阶级知识分子所联合组成的统一战线。从五四运动到第一次大革命这一个时期内，破坏了封建主义的和半封建主义的旧文艺的统治，建立了以反帝反封建为内容的新文艺。从具有共产主义思想的作家和后来逐渐走向共产主义的革命的小资产阶级作家，产生了一些这个时期的代表作品。这些作品在知识分子中发生了普遍的影响，在反帝反封建上起了很大的作用。第一次大革命失败以后，中国右翼资产阶级背叛了革命，中国革命进入了一个新的时期，在文艺方面就产生了左翼文艺运动。左翼文艺运动是无产阶级为领导的无产阶级知识分子和革命的小资产阶级知识分子的统一战线的文艺运动。这个运动以鲁迅为旗手，在反帝反封建反国民党反动派上作了许多英勇的斗争，影响了广大的小资产阶级知识分子和青年学生走向革命，并且锻炼出来了大批的革命文艺干部，总起来说，对中国革命有伟大的贡献。在这个运动中，有一部分文艺工作者，在统一战线问题上曾经采取狭隘的关门主义的错误观点。在抗日战争爆发前后，中国文艺界在抗日这个共同目标下组成了无产阶级为领导的广泛的统一战线。这个统一战线包含了无产阶级的文艺家，小资产阶级的文艺家，资产阶级的文艺家，以及其他一切爱国的新旧文艺人士。虽说在这个统一战线中，有一部分人在某些阶段上又忽略了统一战线内部的原则斗争和严肃批评，产生了右倾的偏向，但整个说来，抗日战争时期的新民主主义文艺运动都是向前发展的，对抗日战争和民主运动是有相当贡献的。在最后两三年内，在运动的主流方向，更有重要的发展和成绩。在国民党统治区，文学艺术工作者在百般压迫之下坚持了工作，一直到最后这支文艺军队并没有被打垮，而且产生了一些对国民党反动派作斗争的有强烈政治意义的作品，开始了若干在毛泽东文艺新方向的影响之下的和人民大众结合的努力。在解放区，由于客观条件的根本不同，由于在毛泽东思想的直接教育之下，由于许多文学艺术工作者的积极的学习和工作，从一九四二年延安文艺界座谈会以来，在理论上和实践上都解决了五四以来所未曾解决的问题，文学艺术开始作到真正和广大的人民群众结合，开始作到真正首先为工农兵服务，从内容到形式都起了极大的变化。这就是三十年来文艺统一战线的基本情况。这也就是三十年来文艺统一战线所获得的成绩和胜利的简略叙述。
    三十年来，除了代表地主阶级的封建文艺已经在理论上解除武装，代表大资产阶级的国民党法西斯文艺，一直受到全国文艺界和全国人民的唾弃以外，中国文艺界的主要论争是存在于这样两条路线之间：一条是代表软弱的自由资产阶级的所谓为艺术而艺术的路线，一条是代表无产阶级和其他革命人民的为人民而艺术的路线。三十年来斗争的结果，就是在欧美没落资产阶级文艺影响之下的为艺术而艺术的文艺理论已经完全破产了，为艺术而艺术的文艺作品也已经丧失了群众。曾经在这种为艺术而艺术的资产阶级文艺思想影响之下的许多文学家艺术家，也逐渐改变了他们的人生观和艺术观，接受了无产阶级文艺思想的领导。而无产阶级文艺思想领导的为人民服务的文学艺术，队伍日益壮大、方向日益明确，因此就日益受到广大人民群众的欢迎和拥护。这样的历史事实说明了中国资产阶级虽然也想在文艺上争取领导，但因为他们不能和人民结合，也就没有争取到的可能。这样的历史事实说明了任何文艺工作者如果不接受无产阶级的领导，他的努力就毫无结果。这正是深刻地说明了三十年来中国的文艺运动的新民主主义的性质。毛泽东主席在“新民主主义论”里面说：“在五四以前，中国的新文化运动，中国的文化革命，是资产阶级领导的，它们还有领导作用。在五四以后，这个阶级的文化思想却比较它的政治上的东西还要落后，就绝无领导作用，至多在革命时期在一定程度上充当一个盟员，至于盟长资格，就不得不落在无产阶级文化思想的肩上。”的确，“这是铁一般的事实，谁也否认不了的。”（⑴⑵）
    这个三十年来中国文艺历史的重要教训，一切认真的想在文艺上有所作为的文学艺术工作者都必须记取。现在，伟大的中国革命的胜利震动了一切过去没有卷入革命的人们。这就使文艺统一战线也可能取得比过去更广泛的基础。毛泽东主席最近在新政治协商会议筹备会上说：“中国的革命是全民族人民大众的革命，除了帝国主义者，封建主义者，官僚资产阶级，国民党反动派及其帮凶们而外，其余的一切人都是我们的朋友。我们有一个广大的和巩固的革命统一战线。这个统一战线是如此广大，它包含了工人阶级，农民阶级，小资产阶级和民族资产阶级。”文艺界的统一战线也是这样，文学艺术工作者首先应该在毛泽东主席所说的这样的范围内在政治上团结起来。文艺上和政治上一样，统一战线里面有着不同的阶级，就自然有着不同的艺术观点。这些不同的观点不可能一下子就归于一致。因此，我们容忍这些不同观点的存在，但是我们除了首先在政治上团结之外，还希望在文艺为人民服务的立场上团结。希望经过文艺界的批评和自我批评，经过文学艺术工作者本身的努力，能够完全达到文艺为人民服务的共同目标。文艺界和政治上一样，只有团结，没有批评，统一战线是不能巩固的。文艺界应该有一种健全的民主作风。只准自己批评任何人，不准任何人批评自己的歪风是一种专制主义的表现，应该为我们有思想的文学艺术工作者所不取。
    各位代表先生们：我们这个空前盛大空前团结的代表大会能够召开，反映了中国人民的政治革命的胜利，也反映了中国人民的文化革命和文艺革命的胜利。中国人民在中国共产党的坚强的正确的领导之下，经历了长期的残酷的武装斗争和其他种种形式的斗争之后，终于在全国范围内取得了伟大的胜利。国民党反动派的残余力量不久即可全部肃清。新的政治协商会议正在准备召开。全国性的民主联合政府即将成立。中国革命即将开始一个广泛的从事政治建设，经济建设，文化建设和国防建设的新的历史时期。在这样的时候我们来召开这样一个代表大会，在这个大会上出席了各方面的爱国民主的文学艺术工作者的代表人物，在这个大会上我们回顾过去，瞻望未来，不能不考虑到我们文学艺术工作者当前的任务和这个广泛的文艺界统一战线今后应该如何加强组织以便我们共同奋斗的问题。这是要在这个大会上来讨论和规定的。为了引起各位先生的讨论，我就来抛砖引玉，根据我以上对于中国新文艺的性质和文艺界的统一战线的认识，先来提出我们文学艺术工作者今后的具体任务。请各位先生考虑：
    一、我们要加强团结，和全国人民一起为彻底打倒帝国主义封建主义和官僚资本主义，建设新民主主义的人民民主共和国而奋斗，努力用文学艺术的武器来加紧这种斗争和建设。
    二、我们要深入现实，表现和赞扬人民大众的勤劳英勇，创造富有思想内容和道德品质，为人民大众所喜闻乐见的人民文艺，使文学艺术发挥教育民众的伟大效能。我们要注意开展工厂、农村、部队中的群众文艺活动，培养群众中新的文艺力量。
    三、我们要扫除半殖民地半封建的旧文学旧艺术的残余势力，反对新文艺界内部的帝国主义国家资产阶级文艺和中国封建主义文艺的影响。我们要批判地接受一切文学艺术遗产，发展一切优良进步的传统，并充分地吸收社会主义国家苏联的宝贵经验，务使爱国主义和国际主义发生有机的联系。
    各位代表先生们，我们的文艺运动历来就有一种和政治运动相结合的宝贵的传统。从五四运动起，在各个历史时期，中国新文艺运动的主流都是当时的革命政治运动的一个重要的战斗单位。为了取得新的民主主义的政治革命和文艺革命的胜利，曾经有许多文学艺术工作者和英勇的中国人民一起献出了他们的血和生命。在土地革命时期，有一些左翼文学家艺术家为国民党反动派所杀害。在抗日战争和人民解放战争时期，有更多的文学艺术工作者牺牲在战场上，牺牲在监狱中，牺牲在特务的手里。我们应该继承他们的奋不顾身的精神来参加反帝反封建反官僚资本的斗争，来参加新中国的建设。
    我们的专业是文学艺术工作，我们对于革命斗争和建设固然应该用政治行动来参加，但主要还应该用我们的文学艺术工作去参加。三十年来的中国新文艺运动，就它所取得的社会地位来说，就它在广大进步群众中的影响来说，就它对于中国革命的贡献来说，无疑地是已经获得了伟大的胜利。但是，和三十年来中国人民的丰富辉煌的斗争和创造比较起来，和广大的中国人民对于文学艺术的要求比较起来，新文艺的成就还是显得很不相称的。为了能够更好地反映人民的斗争和创造，满足人民的要求，我们文学艺术工作者就必须深入现实，加强学习。人民群众的生活是一切文学艺术工作者的取之不尽，用之不竭的源泉。我们必须了解熟悉人民群众，然后才有可能反映人民群众。我们必须先做人民群众的学生，然后才有可能做人民群众的先生。所以深入现实是一切创作家首先应该努力的。其次，接触现实还并不就等于完全认识现实。今天的中国社会正处于伟大的剧烈的变化之中，我们所面对的现实比过去的文学艺术工作者所面对的现实要复杂得多，而我们对于读者、观众、听众又必须采取比过去的文学艺术工作者很不相同的严肃的负责态度，因此，学习革命的理论和政策，学习进步的文艺理论，对于我们就十分必要了。只有通过这种学习，我们才能正确地深刻地认识现实，我们才能提高我们的文学艺术作品的思想性。我们的文学艺术作品的艺术性，也需要提高，需要在正确方向之下的以普及为基础的提高。要提高艺术性，就必须批判地接受中国的外国的文学艺术遗产，吸收那些适合于表现人民，并为人民所容易接受的东西，而抛弃那些相反的东西。总之，对于中国的文学艺术遗产也好，对于外国的文学艺术遗产也好，我们不应该盲目地轻视，排斥；也不应该盲目地崇拜，搬用。
    除了这些方面的努力而外，还有一个我们不应该忽视的重要事实，就是各种半殖民地半封建的旧文艺，以及原封未动的封建文艺，在落后群众中间，还占有着很大的地盘。我们应该以夺取这种反动文艺的阵地为我们的责任。我们应该采取各种有效的方法来完成这种责任。解放区的文学艺术工作者所做的改造农村旧文艺和改造农村旧艺人的工作就是有效的方法之一。在新文艺界内部，也不容讳言的仍然存在着帝国主义国家资产阶级文艺和中国封建主义文艺的影响，我们应该以批评和自我批评的方法来彻底消除。我们要从新文艺运动的外部和内部来扫除这些旧文艺和旧影响。我们还要积极地注意开展工厂、农村、部队中的群众文艺活动。所有这些，都是为了新文艺能够更健全地发展，能够更广泛地和人民结合，能够更好地为人民服务。五四以来新文艺的主要缺点就是和人民大众结合得不够。各位代表先生们！假若我们过去还可以说我们的文学艺术工作的这个缺点和其他缺点主要是由于客观条件的限制的话，那么现在应该说是万事俱备，只欠东风了，这个东风就是我们文学艺术工作者本身的努力。我们应该创造出无愧于我们伟大民族的文学艺术作品，我们应该满足广大的中国人民对于文学艺术的要求。
    各位代表先生们，我们的任务是重大的，但我们已经有了明确的方向，已经有了许多重要的、成功的经验。而这些经验中的最重要的经验就是我们文学艺术工作者自己必须经过各种不同的途径去和人民大众结合。这应该成为一种文学艺术工作者的自觉的运动。已经和人民大众有了初步结合的文学艺术工作者应该切记毛泽东主席的多次的训诫，不要骄傲，不要自满，还没有和人民大众结合的文学艺术工作者应该有足够的认识和决心，努力和人民大众结合，不要视为畏途。谦虚的态度，刻苦的学习和工作，再加以领导上的帮助，我们相信，我们是可以完成我们这一代的文学艺术知识分子的历史任务，可以做出为人民所欢迎并能教育人民的文学艺术工作的！
    一切反帝反封建反官僚资本的文学艺术工作者团结起来，为彻底完成新民主主义的政治革命而奋斗！为彻底完成新民主主义的文化革命文艺革命而奋斗！
    中国人民解放万岁！
    人民的文学艺术胜利万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖人民文艺导师毛主席万岁！
