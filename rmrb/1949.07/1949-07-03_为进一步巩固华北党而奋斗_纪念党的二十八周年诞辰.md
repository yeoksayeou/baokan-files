　　Today, we commemorate the 28th anniversary of our Party's founding in North China, which has been completely liberated, and we feel particularly excited and happy.

　　The North China Party now has 1,520,000 members. From the perspective of Party age, members from the Great Revolution period account for 0.03 percent of all members; members from the Civil War period account for 0.66 percent; members from the Anti-Japanese War period account for 39.31 percent; and members from the Liberation War period after the Japanese surrender account for 60 percent. The number of members from the Great Revolution and Civil War periods is very small, but they are all the leading backbone of the Party. Most of the members during the Anti-Japanese War have become working cadres in various fields. The members during the Liberation War period have short Party age and little experience, but they are the new blood of the Party. From the perspective of composition and ideology, the vast majority of the 1,520,000 members are of peasant origin. They are brave in the struggle against the enemy and loyal to the Party and the people. However, due to their low level of Marxism-Leninism and culture, they often inevitably deviate in the implementation of the Party's policies. This is a problem that urgently needs to be solved by the North China Party. From the perspective of the number of grassroots Party organizations—branches—there are 68,000 branches in North China, accounting for 68 percent of the 100,000 villages. This indicates that there are still 32,000 villages in North China without Party branches, which we need to develop.

　　Under the leadership and cultivation of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the North China Party has undergone long-term training in the Great Revolution, the Civil War, the Anti-Japanese War, and the three-year Liberation War, proving that the North China Party has close ties with the masses and is built by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and therefore it has combat effectiveness. During the Anti-Japanese War, it created the famous Taihang Mountain and Wutai Mountain Anti-Japanese Revolutionary Base Areas, crushing countless encirclements and raids by the Japanese invaders. After the Japanese surrender, Chiang Kai-shek launched a counter-revolutionary civil war and attacked the liberated areas. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of North China fought bravely and carried out a great movement to join the army and participate in the war. About one million liberated peasants who had undergone land reform poured into the People's Liberation Army. In completing the huge task of supporting the front lines, the people of North China, except for the old, the young, the sick, and the weak, almost all participated in this work, regardless of gender, and finally assisted the People's Liberation Army in defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries until the armed enemies in North China were completely wiped out. Now, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the North China Party has victoriously entered a new period of restoring and developing production.

　　With the complete liberation of North China, the focus of the Party's leadership has shifted from the countryside to the cities, and from war to construction. Because of these changes, the issue of unity between Party members of worker origin and Party members of peasant origin has arisen, as has the issue of unity between worker-peasant cadres and intellectual cadres, the issue of unity between urban cadres and rural cadres, and the issue of unity between Party cadres and non-Party cadres. We must spend a certain amount of time, according to the spirit of rectification, to oppose mountain-stronghold mentality, departmentalism, and sectarianism, in order to strengthen unity within the Party and between the Party and non-Party cadres.

　　With the development and needs of the revolutionary situation, in the past three years, the North China Party has transferred more than 50,000 local cadres from the old liberated areas, most of whom were sent to Northeast China, Central China, and Jiangnan to open up work, and some of whom participated in the work of the newly liberated cities and newly liberated areas in North China. This has resulted in a shortage of cadres, especially at the district level, in the North China region, and their quality is weak. However, years of experience have proven that the district level is precisely the most important link connecting the county party committee and the branch, and implementing the Party's policies to the grassroots organizations of the Party. Therefore, the weak leadership has placed the task of greatly promoting and cultivating cadres on the North China Party.

　　Based on the above situation, the following new tasks are proposed for the construction of the North China Party:

　　(1) Nearly one million new Party members (this group of Party members poured into the Party after land reform and the Liberation War) have a very low level of Marxism-Leninism. We must spend one year or several years to vigorously educate and improve the level of Marxism-Leninism of these Party members, in order to further consolidate the Party politically, ideologically, and organizationally. Therefore, systematically strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought by cadres and Party members has become an important task of the Party at present. Cadres above the county level should conscientiously read the twelve books according to the decision of the Central Committee. Party committees at all levels in North China should conduct regular examinations and tests to make it a system of the Party. New Party member training classes, branch secretary training classes, and district committees (main cadres) and county committees should attend the provincial Party school for study, mainly teaching the history of the Party and the basic theory of the Party, laying the foundation for a materialistic historical viewpoint. Party members with low cultural levels should strive to learn culture.

　　(2) Our main task in the future is construction. Therefore, all Party members and cadres must learn economics, learn how to run factories, learn how to do business, and learn how to run cooperatives in a short period of time. These are all unfamiliar to us, but we must learn them, and we can learn them.

　　(3) Party committees and leading cadres at all levels in North China should consciously handle and resolve the issues of unity between worker Party members and peasant Party members, worker-peasant cadres and intellectual cadres, urban cadres and rural cadres, new cadres and old cadres, and Party cadres and non-Party cadres. To deal with this issue, we must adhere to the high communist principles, educate all Party members, strictly oppose sectarianism, be strict with ourselves and lenient with others (but not abandon principles), master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and give appropriate education, criticism, and even punishment to all Party members who violate Party discipline, distinguishing between right and wrong and the severity of the offense. Party members who abide by discipline and actively work for the Party should be rewarded and commended.

　　(4) Our Party must be good at uniting the masses, leading the masses forward, and also be good at accepting the supervision of the masses and constantly receiving the education of the masses. Therefore, the Central Committee decided very early on to completely open up the Party branch. After the North China Party implemented this instruction, it consulted with the masses on everything, making it easier for the masses to grasp the Party's policies, making the relationship between the Party and the masses closer, promoting the democratic system in the countryside, and making the alliance between the Party and non-Party members more solid. We must continue this work. Branch meetings should invite representatives of the masses to participate and regularly solicit their opinions on the Party. We must achieve "adhering to the truth and correcting mistakes." Communist Party members must adhere to the Party's line and policies, but if they find real mistakes, they should be prepared to correct them at any time.

　　(5) In order to carry out the revolution well and build China well, the correct leadership of the proletariat and its political party—the Communist Party—is needed, and a solid worker-peasant alliance is needed. This is a matter of course and cannot be shaken. But this does not mean that only the Communist Party is enough. That is not right. Communist Party members can only be a minority of the people of the whole country. To do things well, we must unite all revolutionary classes, all democratic parties, and democratic people. Without the unity of the absolute majority of the people of China, the Chinese revolution cannot be victorious. The whole Party must distinguish between enemies and friends. Only by being good at uniting friends can we more effectively strike at enemies. Therefore, we must regard the vast majority of democratic people outside the Party as the same as our own cadres, and sincerely and frankly consult with them and solve those problems that must be consulted and solved, so that they can work happily and give full play to their enthusiasm, achieving both authority and responsibility. At the same time, starting from unity, we must also give appropriate criticism or struggle to their mistakes and shortcomings in order to achieve the goal of unity. Right-leaning accommodationism and "left"-leaning closed-doorism are both wrong and equally harmful to the cause of the people, and should be prevented and corrected.

　　(6) Raise revolutionary vigilance and overcome complacency. After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist. They will inevitably and are already trying to fight us to the death, and we must not underestimate these enemies. At present, bandits and special agents in North China are adopting various forms—armed, unarmed, open, and secret—to conspire to sabotage the liberated areas and the revolutionary cause. This is the form of struggle that Kuomintang bandits will inevitably adopt against us at their final death, which will be a relatively long-term, complex, and fierce class struggle. Therefore, we must be highly vigilant and learn this struggle in order to finally extinguish the enemy; otherwise, we will suffer undue losses.

　　(7) In the rural areas, with the land reform having ended and the large-scale production movement having been launched, Party organizations at all levels in North China should develop Party members and establish branches in a planned and focused manner, eliminating blank villages. In the newly liberated cities, after trade unions in various industries have been organized and workers have been educated and mobilized, Party members should also be developed and branches established in a planned and focused manner. In developing Party members, whether in cities or villages, we should first absorb advanced elements of the working class into the Party, opposing both closed-doorism and forced recruitment, adhering to the principle of "rather less but better," and following the procedures for joining the Party in accordance with the Party Constitution.

　　Comrades, our Party has already appeared before the people of the whole country in the posture of a victor. But the new task of production and construction is even more arduous. Always remember Chairman Mao's instructions, "Be prudent and humble, guard against arrogance and impetuosity," and maintain our Party's fine traditions of hard work, simplicity, and close ties with the masses, in order to victoriously build a new China.

### 为进一步巩固华北党而奋斗　纪念党的二十八周年诞辰

　　为进一步巩固华北党而奋斗
  　纪念党的二十八周年诞辰
    今天我们在已经完全解放了的华北来纪念我党二十八周年诞辰，感到特别兴奋和愉快。
    现在华北党共有党员一百五十二万人，从党龄上看，大革命时期的党员占全体党员的百分之点零三；内战时期的党员占百分之点六六；抗战时期的党员占百分之三九点三一；日本投降以后解放战争时期的党员占百分之六十。大革命与内战时期党员人数很少，但均为党的领导骨干。抗战时期党员大多数均已成为各方面的工作干部。解放战争时期的党员，党龄短，锻炼少，但他们是党的新血液。从成份与思想上看，一百五十二万党员中绝大多数系农民出身，他们对敌人斗争是英勇的，对党对人民是忠实的，但由于马列主义水平和文化水平很低，因而在执行党的政策上，常常不免发生偏差，这是目前华北党急待解决的一个问题。从党的基层组织——支部的数量上看，全华北共有六万八千个支部，占十万个村庄的百分之六十八。这指明在华北尚有三万二千个村庄没有党的支部，有待我们去发展。
    华北党在党中央及毛主席的领导和培养下，经过了大革命、内战、抗战及三年来解放战争的长期锻炼，证明华北党是与群众有密切联系的，是马列主义与毛泽东思想所建设起来的，因而它是有战斗力的。在抗战期间它创造了有名的太行山和五台山抗日革命根据地，粉碎了日寇无数次的围攻和扫荡。日寇投降以后，蒋介石发动反革命内战，向解放区进攻，华北人民在党的领导下，英勇奋战，进行了伟大的参军参战运动，有一百万左右经过土地改革的翻身农民涌入了人民解放军，在完成庞大的支援前线任务上，华北人民几乎是除老幼病弱外，不分男女全部地参加了这一工作，终于协助人民解放军打退了国民党反动派，直至完全肃清华北的武装敌人。现在华北党在党中央正确领导下，已胜利地进入恢复与发展生产的新时期。
    华北全境解放，党的领导重心，从乡村转移到城市，从战争转移到建设，因为有了这些变化，随着发生了工人出身的党员与农民出身的党员的团结问题，发生了工农干部与知识分子干部的团结问题，发生了城市干部与乡村干部的团结问题，也发生了党的干部与非党干部的团结问题，我们必须花费一定的时间，根据整风的精神，反对山头主义、本位主义、宗派主义，以便增强党内的和党与非党干部的团结。
    随着革命形势的发展和需要，三年以来，华北党从老解放区约抽调出五万以上地方干部，大多数派往东北、华中、江南等地开辟工作，一部分参加了华北新解放城市和新解放区的工作。这样就形成现在华北区的干部特别是区级干部，量少质弱。但多年经验证明，区一级恰恰是联系县委与支部，贯彻党的政策到党的基层组织的最重要的一环，因此形成领导不强，这就课给华北党以大量提拔和培养干部的任务。
    根据以上情况，给华北党的建设提出了下列新的任务：
    （一）有将近百万的新党员（这批党员是在土地改革和解放战争以后涌进党来的），马列主义水平很低，我们必须花费一年或者几年的时间，用大力来教育和提高这些党员马列主义的水平，以便从政治上、思想上、组织上进一步巩固党，因此有计划地加强干部和党员马列主义、毛泽东思想的学习成为目前党的重要任务。县以上干部，应根据中央决定认真读好十二本书，华北各级党委应举行定期考试测验，使之成为党的一种制度。应普遍开办新党员训练班，支部书记训练班，区委（主要干部）、县委应进省委党校学习，主要讲授党的历史及党的基本理论，奠定唯物的历史的观点。文化低的党员要努力学习文化。
    （二）我们今后的主要任务是建设，因此全体党员干部均必须在短期内学会经济，学会办工厂，学会做生意，学会办合作社，这些对我们都是生疏的，但必须学会，我们也能够学会。
    （三）华北各级党委各级领导干部，要自觉地处理解决工人党员与农民党员、工农干部与知识分子干部、城市干部与乡村干部、新干部与老干部、党的干部与非党干部的团结问题。处理这一问题要坚持高度的共产主义原则，以教育全体党员，严格地反对宗派主义，责己从严责人从宽（但不放弃原则），掌握批评与自我批评的武器，对一切违犯党纪的党员应分清是非轻重，给以适当的教育批评直至处分。对遵守纪律，积极为党工作的党员，应予奖励表扬。
    （四）我们的党要善于团结群众领导群众前进，又要善于接受群众的监督，经常获得群众的教育。因此中央很早就决定完全公开党的支部，华北党执行这一指示后，遇事与群众商量，使党的政策更易为群众所掌握，使党和群众的关系更加密切，促进了农村中间的民主制度，使党与非党的联盟更加巩固，我们必须继续这一工作。支部大会应邀请群众代表参加，经常征求他们对党的意见，要做到“坚持真理，修正错误”，共产党员一定要坚持党的路线政策，但如果发现真正有错误，就应准备随时加以纠正。
    （五）为了把革命进行的好，把中国建设的好，需要无产阶级及其政党——共产党的正确领导，需要巩固的工农联盟，这是天经地义，不能动摇的。但这并不等于说只要共产党就够了，这是不对的。共产党员只能是全国人民中的少数，要把事情做好必须团结各革命阶级各民主党派民主人士，没有全中国绝对多数人的团结，中国革命是不可能胜利的。全党必须分清敌友，只有善于团结朋友，才能更有力地打击敌人。因此必须把党外大多数民主人士看成和自己的干部一样，和他们诚恳坦白商量和解决那些必须商量和解决的问题，使他们愉快的工作，充分发挥他们的积极性，做到有职有权。同时从团结出发，对于他们的错误和缺点，亦必须给以适当的批评或斗争，以达团结之目的。右的迁就主义与“左”的关门主义的偏向都是不对的，对人民的事业同是有害的，应加防止与纠正。
    （六）提高革命警惕性，克服麻痹现象。在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然要而且已经在试图和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。目前华北匪特正采取着武装的、非武装的、公开的、秘密的各种形式，阴谋破坏解放区和革命事业。这是国民党匪徒们在其最后死亡时所必然要对我们采用的斗争形式，这将是一个较长期的复杂的剧烈的阶级斗争，故须高度警惕，并学会这种斗争，以便最后扑灭敌人；否则，就会招致不应有的损失。
    （七）在农村中间土地改革已经结束，大生产运动已经开展的情况下，华北各级党应该有计划地有重点地发展党员，建立支部，消灭空白村，在新解放城市中，各业工会已经组织起来，工人已经经过教育发动之后，亦应有计划地有重点地发展党员建立支部，在发展党员中，无论城市与乡村都应首先吸收工人阶级的先进分子入党，既反对关门主义，也反对拉夫主义，坚持宁少勿滥方针，并遵照党章履行入党手续。
    同志们，我们的党已经以胜利者的姿态出现在全国人民面前。但新的生产建设的任务更为艰巨，时刻记住毛主席的指示“谨慎谦虚，戒骄戒躁”，保持我党艰苦朴素，联系群众的优良传统，以便胜利地建设新中国。
