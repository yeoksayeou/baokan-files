　　Lenin on Trade Unions and Specialists

Unless the Communist Party, the Soviet regime, and the trade unions truly cherish all specialists who work honestly, understand their profession, and love their profession, even if they are still ideologically discriminating against communism, as they cherish their own eyes, then there can be no real achievements in socialist construction. Specialists, before entering the highest stage of communist society, are ultimately a special class in society. To make them satisfied with their work under the socialist system, both materially and in terms of rights, both in terms of comradely cooperation with workers and peasants, and ideologically, that is, to make them realize that their work is beneficial to society without relying on the selfishness of the capitalist class, and that they live better than under the capitalist system, we cannot achieve this quickly, but we must achieve it anyway. If an agency does not systematically carry out this work that has already been effective, that is, guaranteeing specialists in all aspects, encouraging outstanding members, defending and protecting their interests, etc., then no one will admit that such an agency is organized even tolerably well.

When trade unions carry out all such work (or systematically participate in relevant work in all agencies), they should not proceed from the interests of the agency, but should proceed from the overall interests of labor and the national economy. Regarding the specialists, the trade unions should be responsible for carrying out extremely arduous and difficult work, that is, constantly promoting the broad masses of workers to establish a correct relationship with the specialists. Only such work can achieve truly significant practical results. (Excerpt from Selected Works of Lenin, Volume 2)

　　列宁论职工会与专门家
    共产党、苏维埃政权以及职工会，不做到真正爱护一切诚实工作、通晓本业并酷爱本业，纵令在思想上还完全是歧视共产主义的专门家们，如同爱护自己的眼珠一样，那末，也就根本谈不上社会主义建设事业中的任何真实成绩了。专门家在尚未进到共产主义社会发展的最高阶段之前，终归还是社会上的一个特别的阶层，要使他在社会主义制度下，无论在物质或权利方面，无论在与工农间的同志合作方面，亦无论在思想方面，即满意于自己的工作，并觉悟到自己这种工作不依赖于资本家阶级底自私自利而对社会有益方面，都比在资本主义制度下，生活得要好些，这点，我们虽不是很快就能实现，但无论如何都要实现。如果一个机关，不来有计划地进行这种已经收到成效的工作，即在各方面保障专门家，鼓励其中优秀分子，捍卫与保护他们的利益等等，那么，任何人也不会承认这样的机关是多少布置得不坏的。
    职工会进行所有这样的全部工作（或有系统地参加一切机关中的相当工作）时，应该不从该机关的利益出发，而应当从劳动与国民经济的整个利益出发。关于专门家这层，职工会应负责进行极艰巨困难的工作，即经常来促进广大的劳动群众，使他们能与专门家建立一种正确关系。只有这样的工作，才能收到真正重大的实际效果。  　　（摘自列宁文选第二卷）
