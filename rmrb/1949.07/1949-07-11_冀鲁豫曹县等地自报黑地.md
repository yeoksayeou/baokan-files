　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan
    Cao County and other places report black land
    ▲ After the wheat collection began, the self-reporting of black land in the new districts and newly recovered areas of the Southwestern Shandong Special Zone and the Linhe Special Zone. According to statistics, Cao County has reported more than 1,000 hectares, Dingtao more than 300 hectares, and Heze more than 150 hectares. This has increased national income and balanced the burden on farmers.
    ▲ Significant achievements have been made in drought-resistant planting, seedling protection, and seedling watering in seven counties including Zhinan Yang. As of the 15th of last month, a total of 6,900 brick wells and 2,911 earth wells have been dug; 74,725 mu have been planted and watered.
    ▲ The Qiwan County Party Committee inspected the work of cadres leading production and believes that there have been achievements (such as leading the masses to dig wells and plant seeds), but there are still the following problems: (1) Many meetings are held after arriving in the village, but problems are not solved. (2) After accepting the planting task in the county, they only pay attention to planting, and do not lead the work of how to protect seedlings, weed, deliver manure, and harrow wheat stubble. (3) Not proceeding from reality: for example, in some places, farmers have already planted, but the cadres are still arranging for planting; (4) Insufficient attention to the problem of how to organize planting for those who are farming on behalf of others and those without labor or livestock. The county party committee is currently studying improvement measures.

　　冀鲁豫
    曹县等地自报黑地
    ▲麦征开始后，○——○鲁西南专区、临河专区之新区和新收复区的自报黑地工作，据统计曹县已报出一千余顷，定陶三百余顷，菏泽一百五十顷。增加了国家收入，平衡农民负担。
    ▲直南阳等七县，抗旱点种、保苗、浇苗工作获显著成绩。截至上月十五日止，共打砖井六千九百眼，土井二千九百一十一眼；点种浇苗七万四千七百廿五亩。
    ▲齐万县县委会检查干部领导生产工作，认为成绩是有的（如领导群众挖井点种等），但尚存有以下几个问题：（一）到村后开会多，但不解决问题。（二）在县上接受了点种任务，下去后也只注意点种，对如何保苗、锄苗、送粪和耙麦茬地等工作都不去领导。（三）不从实际出发：如有的地方农民已经种上了，干部还布置点种；（四）对代耕及无劳畜力的如何组织点种问题注意不够。县委会现正研究改进办法。
