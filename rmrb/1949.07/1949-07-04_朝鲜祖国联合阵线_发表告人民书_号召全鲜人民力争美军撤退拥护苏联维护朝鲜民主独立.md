Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: Tass, Pyongyang, 2nd: The founding assembly of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front issued an appeal to all democratic political parties and public organizations, and to all Korean people, stating that although nearly four years have passed since Korea's liberation from Japanese aggressors, it remains unified. The northern and southern parts of the country are developing in opposite directions. In the north, victorious democratic construction is beginning to realize the people's long-held dreams. In the south, reactionaries are doing their best to establish their rule and suppress democracy. The appeal pointed out that the unification of the Korean people is being hindered by American imperialists and their stooges, Syngman Rhee. The policy of the American imperialists is to turn South Korea into their anti-democratic military and political base in the Far East, into an economic appendage of the United States, and a new source of wealth for Wall Street's monopolistic capital. The appeal emphatically stated that the enslavement of South Korea has aroused the anger of all Korean people. The Korean people are fighting for the withdrawal of US troops and for a unified, independent, and democratic Korea.

The appeal continued: The consistent policy pursued by the Soviet Union at all stages of the development of the Korean question is entirely in accordance with the interests of the Korean people. The Soviet Union has demonstrated its selfless policy of respecting the sovereignty and rights of the Korean people. The Soviet government has always defended and continues to defend the right of the Korean people to achieve national unification and democratic independence.

The appeal urged all democratic parties and public organizations in North and South Korea, as well as all Korean people, to work together to achieve the peaceful unification of Korea. The appeal listed the following program proposed by the Fatherland United Front for peaceful unification: The unification of Korea must be realized by the Korean people themselves; the immediate withdrawal of US troops stationed in Korea and the so-called "United Nations Korean Commission"; North and South Korea should simultaneously hold elections for a single Korean legislative body in September 1949, under the guidance of a committee composed of representatives of democratic parties and public organizations that desire the peaceful unification of Korea; elections should be based on universal and equal suffrage, with voting conducted in secret. The appeal also put forward detailed measures to guarantee freedom of elections throughout Korea, especially to stop the persecution of democratic political parties, public organizations, and their leaders; to grant legal status to all democratic parties and public organizations, giving them the right to freedom of activity; and to lift the ban on the publication of newspapers by democratic parties and public organizations. The program stipulates that the supreme legislative body established on the basis of the general election will adopt the Constitution of the Korean Republic, and a new government will be formed in accordance with this constitution. The appeal concluded, "We have no doubt that the people will enthusiastically support our proposals. The people will remove all obstacles hindering their progress toward unification, independence, and democracy. Long live a unified, independent, and democratic Korean Republic! Long live the united Korean people!"

　　朝鲜祖国联合阵线
  　发表告人民书
    号召全鲜人民力争美军撤退拥护苏联维护朝鲜民主独立
    【新华社北平三日电】塔斯社平壤二日讯：朝鲜民主祖国联合阵线成立大会发表告朝鲜各民主政党与公共团体和全朝鲜人民书称：朝鲜虽然从日本侵略者手中解放以来已近四年，但仍然没有统一起来。国家的南部和北部朝着相反的方向发展着。在北部，胜利的民主建设正开始实现人民多年的梦想。在南部，反动派正尽力建立其统治并压制民主。告人民书指出：朝鲜人民的统一正被美国帝国主义者及其李承晚走狗们所阻碍。美国帝国主义者的政策乃是使南朝鲜变成他们在远东的反民主的军事、政治基地，变成美国的经济附庸和华尔街垄断资本致富的新泉源。告人民书力称：对南朝鲜的奴役已激怒了全朝鲜人民。朝鲜人民正在为争取美军撤退而斗争，为争取统一的和独立的民主朝鲜而斗争。
    告人民书继称：苏联在朝鲜问题发展各阶段中所奉行的一贯政策，是完全符合朝鲜人民利益的。苏联业已证明其尊重朝鲜人民主权及权利的大公无私的政策。苏联政府一向维护并且现在仍继续维护朝鲜人民实现国家统一与民主独立的权利。
    告人民书敦促南北朝鲜一切民主党派和公共团体以及朝鲜全体人民为实现朝鲜的和平统一而共同奋斗。告人民书列举祖国联合阵线为和平的统一而提出如下纲领：朝鲜的统一必须由朝鲜人民自己来实现；立即撤退驻朝鲜的美国军队及所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”；在希望朝鲜和平统一的民主党派及公共团体的代表所组成的委员会的指导下，南北朝鲜于一九四九年九月同时举行朝鲜单一立法机构的选举；选举应以普遍与平等的选举权为基础，用秘密方式投票。告人民书中并提出详细办法，以保障朝鲜全国的选举自由，尤其是停止迫害民主政党公共团体及其领袖；给予一切民主政党及公共团体以合法地位，给予它们以活动自由的权利；取消对民主政党、及公共团体出版机关报的禁令。该纲领预定：在大选基础上成立的最高立法机关将通过朝鲜共和国宪法，根据这一宪法，新政府将成立。告人民书最后称，“我们毫不怀疑，人民定将热烈拥护我们的建议。人民将排除阻碍他们向统一、独立及民主前进道路上的一切障碍。统一、独立、民主的朝鲜共和国万岁！团结的朝鲜人民万岁！”
