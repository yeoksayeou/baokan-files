Acting as an agent for producers to buy raw materials and sell products, introducing direct transactions between cooperatives.
Tianjin Cooperative Freight Station's business develops.

[Reported by this newspaper] The Tianjin Cooperative Freight Station was established and developed its business in uniting cooperatives from various regions to conduct unified purchase and sales, introducing direct transactions between various cooperatives, purchasing necessities for consumer members in the city, and helping production cooperatives obtain raw materials and promote their products, avoiding middleman exploitation and stabilizing the Tianjin market.

From its establishment on May 21st to June 15th, within 25 days, no less than 50 cooperative units from various regions came to Tianjin to purchase goods, including supply and marketing cooperatives at the provincial, municipal, and county levels in Northeast China, Hebei, Shandong, Rehe, and Chahar. Among them, 32 cooperatives completed transactions through the Cooperative Freight Station. According to incomplete statistics, the goods purchased on behalf of these cooperatives included: 690 rolls of cloth, mostly going to Northeast China and Chahar; 1,312,213 *jin* of grain, mostly going to Central Hebei (fine grains went to Peiping); 161 large barrels of kerosene, sold to various regions; 35 bags of alkali (each bag weighing 125 kilograms), mostly going to Shandong and Central Hebei; 559,516 *jin* of bean cake, mostly going to Shandong, Central Hebei, and Western Hebei; and over 20 other types of goods such as newsprint, white sugar, waterwheels, and cement, with significant transaction volumes. Goods sold on behalf of cooperatives included 2,004,001 *jin* of coarse grains and 122,742 *jin* of fine grains transported from Northeast China and Shandong. In addition, there was rice from Xiaozhan near Tianjin and wheat from Central Hebei; 37,500 *jin* of cotton and 31 pieces of cotton yarn (each piece weighing 40), mostly from Central Hebei and the triangle area of Peiping, Tianjin, and Baoding; 16,163 *jin* of peanut oil, mostly from the Bohai region; and a total of 49,000 *jin* of hemp and flax, from Shandong, Northeast China, and Zhangjiakou. Transactions involving other goods such as tobacco leaves, almonds, and *huangqin* [Scutellaria baicalensis] and soap were also considerable. According to incomplete statistics for the first half of June, the total transaction value of goods sold and purchased on behalf of cooperatives was 112,867,641 yuan (50,510,646 yuan for purchases and 62,356,995 yuan for sales). Direct transactions between cooperatives in various regions, introduced by the Cooperative Freight Station, were also very common. For example, Northeast China recently planned to exchange 100 truckloads of grain (60,000 *jin* per truck) for cloth from Central Hebei (mostly Gaoyang cloth; the current supply is insufficient, and it is planned to organize production based on the styles and colors requested by cooperative members in Northeast China, with transactions to be carried out in batches). Direct transportation of grain and cloth can save both parties the expenses of unloading, warehousing, and transaction taxes in Tianjin. For example, each truckload of grain can save at least 63,750 yuan, and with direct transactions of five truckloads per day, this could save 318,750 yuan. This plays a certain role in adjusting the prices of goods in the two regions. Secondly, the Jinan General Cooperative recently exchanged 600,000 *jin* of millet directly for cement in Tangshan. The Cooperative Freight Station also introduced industrial raw materials such as *pixiao* [sodium arsenite] transported by cooperatives from various regions to be sold directly to public and private factories in Tianjin in large quantities. Generally speaking, the transaction prices are based on the principles of benefiting both parties and small profits with quick turnover to strengthen capital turnover. This has established a foundation of credit between the various cooperatives and the Cooperative Freight Station.

In order to establish its own business and fully and promptly guarantee the supply of grain to members in the city and cooperatives in various regions, the Freight Station recently sent people to Northeast China with 2,000 rolls of cloth to exchange for grain. On the other hand, based on the needs of Northeast China, people were sent with 180,000 *jin* of millet to Baiyangdian to purchase reed mats to be transported to Northeast China in exchange for grain.

The Cooperative Freight Station is currently fully committed to serving cooperatives in various regions. It is responsible for introducing the situation in Tianjin, such as market conditions, and does not charge transaction fees. It also provides dormitories, charging each person six *jin* of millet per day for meals, while general private freight stations charge at least fifteen *jin* of millet per day for board and lodging. The commission for transactions introduced by private freight stations is 2% of the total amount. As the Freight Station is newly established and has few cadres, and lacks proficiency in business techniques, such as accurately grasping the daily fluctuations of the market and the quality of goods, the dormitories are insufficient, the warehouse is too small, and it has not been able to establish more extensive transaction relationships with various factories or other parties, causing some inconvenience to customers. However, these shortcomings will be gradually overcome as the Freight Station's business develops.

Judging from the spontaneous situation of large-scale material exchanges by the Cooperative Freight Station in the past month, the main trend is that Northeast China and Chahar (mainly Northeast China) supply a large amount of food grain to Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, and the Peiping-Tianjin area, exchanging it for the cloth, yarn, and cotton textiles they need. Today, due to the large-scale cotton planting in the aforementioned regions (Central Hebei and Southern Hebei) and the current shortage of grain among farmers, the Tianjin Cooperative Freight Station should urgently contact the Northeast Supply and Marketing Cooperative to plan to lend grain from Northeast China to the cooperative members who plant cotton. In addition to solving their food problems, the cooperatives can guarantee the organized purchase of cotton from members at harvest time—based on the current price, guaranteeing the farmers the profits they deserve, enabling them to expand reproduction—to fully supply state factories with cotton for production and stabilize possible fluctuations in cotton prices at that time. All other material exchanges should be centered around this core business activity. Only in this way can it avoid being in a passive state in exchanges.

The Tianjin Cooperative Freight Station recently plans to be transferred to the leadership of the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative in order to grasp the activity plans and situation of the entire region. In addition, it should strengthen the research and investigation institutions, such as promptly providing information on market conditions and the needs of materials and quantities to the cooperatives in various regions, so as to carry out production in a planned and step-by-step manner around supply and marketing. Secondly, the Cooperative Freight Station should be enterprise-oriented as soon as possible: such as establishing strict forms, accounting, transaction regulations and systems, etc. In order to achieve self-sufficiency, it may be advisable to deduct the lowest transaction fees, etc. Furthermore, attention should be paid to leading the improvement of the styles and techniques of products from various regions. For example, a batch of soap recently shipped from the Botou Cooperative was only able to be sold at a low price due to its extremely rough style and packaging, resulting in a significant loss. According to an experienced export trade merchant, "If the straw braid from Xianxian is slightly improved in technology, the price can be increased by half."

　　代生产者买原料卖产品介绍各合作社直接交易
    津合作货栈业务发展
    【本报讯】天津合作货栈在联合各地合作社统一购销，介绍各社间的直接成交，以及为本市消费社员购得必需品，帮助生产社获得原料与推销其产品，避免中间剥削和稳定天津市场的活动中建立起来，并开展了业务。
    从五月二十一日成立至六月十五日二十五天内，各地来津购货的合作社不下五十余单位，包括东北、河北、山东、热河、察哈尔等地区省、市、县各级供销社。其中通过合作货栈成交物品的有三十二个社，据不完全统计，代买物品有：布六九○匹，多走东北、察哈尔；粮食一、三一二、二一三斤，多走冀中（细粮则走北平）；煤油一六一大桶，行销各地；碱三十五包（每包一百二十五公斤），多走山东、冀中；豆饼五五九、五一六斤，多走山东、冀中、冀西；其他如白报纸、白糖、水车、洋灰等二十余种交易数字亦颇可观。代卖的则有东北及山东运来的粗粮二、○○四、○○一斤，细粮一二二、七四二斤，此外尚有天津附近小站来卖的大米及冀中小麦；棉花三七、五○○斤，棉纱三十一件（每件四十＠①），多来自冀中及平津保三角地带；花生油一六、一六三斤，多来自渤海区；麻及胡麻共四九、○○○斤，来自山东、东北、张家口。其他如烟叶、杏仁、黄芩、肥皂等物品成交也不少。据六月上半月不完全的统计，代卖代买成交资金总额为一亿一千二百八十六万七千六百四十一元（代买为五○、五一○、六四六元；代卖为六二、三五六、九九五元），而由合作货栈介绍各地区社间的直接成交，亦极普遍。如最近东北拟以粮一百车（每车六万斤）换冀中布匹（多为高阳布，刻不敷数拟根据东北社员要求式样及颜色组织生产，陆续成交）。粮、布直接运达，可省去双方在津卸车、装库、成交税等费用。如粮食每车至少可省六万三千七百五十元，每天直接成交以五车计，即可省下三十一万八千七百五十元。这对调剂两地物品价格上起着一定的作用。其次如济南总社近以小米六十万斤去唐山直接换取洋灰，合作货栈介绍各地区社运来的工业原料如皮硝等直接售给天津各公、私营工厂为数亦大。一般说，交易价格是把握了两利、薄利多销以加强资金周转的原则。这也就建立了各合作社间及合作货栈的信用基础。
    为建立该栈自身业务，以充分和及时保证供给本市社员以及各地区社的粮食要求，该栈近已派人携布二千匹去东北换取粮食；另方面则根据东北要求，派人带小米十八万斤去白洋淀收购苇席运往东北换回粮食。
    合作货栈在目前完全是以服务各地合作社为宗旨。负责介绍天津行情等情况，不取成交手续费，并设有宿舍，吃饭每人每日按六斤小米收费，而一般私人货栈，每人每天膳宿起码为十五斤小米左右；经私人货栈介绍成交佣钱为总额的百分之二。由于该栈初创，干部少，且在经营技术上不够熟练，如掌握不住每天市场真正行情的涨落，货色好坏等。又宿舍不敷应用，仓库太小，未能与各工厂或其他方面建立起更广泛的成交关系等，致使客人感到某些不便。但所存在的这些缺点，将会随着该栈业务的开展逐步克服的。
    从近一个月来合作货栈大宗物资交流的自发情况看来，主要是东北和察哈尔（东北为主）以大量食粮供给冀中、冀南及平津地区，换回自己所需要的布、纱及棉织品。在今天由于上述地区（冀中、冀南）大量植棉及目前农民缺粮，天津合作货栈应紧急设法与东北供销合作总社取得联系，筹划以东北粮食贷给植棉农的民社员，除解决他们吃粮问题外，秋收时合作社可保证有组织收购社员的棉花——根据当时价格，保证农民应得的利润，使之能扩大再生产——以充分供给国家工厂棉花进行生产，和稳定当时棉价可能发生的波动。而其他一切物资交流则以围绕这个中心业务活动。如此，才不致使自己在交流中陷于被动状态。
    天津合作货栈最近拟拨交华北供销合作总社领导，以便掌握全区活动计划和情况。另外，应该加强调查研究机构，如及时供给各地区社行情及需求物资情况及数量，以便有计划有步骤围绕供销进行生产；其次，合作货栈应尽速企业化：如建立严格表格、会计、交易规章和制度等。为达到自给自足计，不妨抽最低成交手续等费用；再次，要注意领导改进各地产品的式样和技术。如最近一次泊头社运来一批肥皂，因式样和包装极粗糙，只能低价售出，吃亏很大；据一有经验的出口贸易商人谈：“献县的草帽辫如在技术上稍加改进，价格可提高一半。”
