Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 24th: TASS, New York, July 23rd: The Washington Permanent Committee for Peace, which calls for peaceful means to replace the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, recently issued a statement strongly criticizing the Senate's decision to approve the North Atlantic Treaty. The statement said: The Senate's approval of the North Atlantic Treaty is a major decision for the American people. This is the first time in American history that it has undertaken the obligation to pursue a futile policy of military alliances, inviting a global arms race. The statement said that the United States' assumption of this obligation is tragic in nature; however, if the military aid plan currently being prepared can be overthrown, there is still a possibility of avoiding the most serious dangers of war in the future. The Senate debate revealed an indisputable fact: the approval of the North Atlantic Treaty does not grant Truman or the State Department the power to implement the military provisions of the treaty. Many senators who voted in favor of the treaty also opposed the plan to supply Western European countries with armaments. Even supporters of the treaty, such as Connally, Vandenberg, and Dulles, said that the approval of the North Atlantic Treaty does not force the United States to implement a military aid plan. The committee statement further said: The American people are worried about where they are being dragged by the Cold War policy. The arms program will lead to the bankruptcy of the American economy and will inevitably bring the United States closer to war.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 24th: According to Agence France-Presse, New York: Former Progressive Party presidential candidate Wallace declared on the 22nd that he would wage a relentless struggle against Truman's "Military Foreign Aid Plan." He will fight against the plan in the House Appropriations Committee and the House of Representatives. Wallace also stated: The Progressives believe that the road to peace goes through the United Nations, and they oppose this improper foreign aid appropriation, which will trigger a global arms race.

　　华盛顿和平常设委员会
  　抨击参院批准侵略公约
    呼吁人民推翻“军事援外计划”　华莱士反对杜鲁门“援外拨款”
    【新华社北平二十四日电】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：华盛顿要求以和平办法代替北大西洋公约会议的常设委员会顷发表声明，强烈抨击参院批准北大西洋公约的决定。该声明说：参院批准北大西洋公约，对于美国人民来说，是一个重大的决定。这是美国在历史上第一次承担义务以奉行无益的军事联盟政策，招来世界的军备竞赛。声明说，美国承担这个义务，是含有悲剧性质的；但是，如能推翻正在准备中的供给军事援助计划，还有避免将来发生最严重战争危险的可能。从参院的辩论中，看出一个无可争辩的事实：批准北大西洋公约，并没有给予杜鲁门或国务院以执行公约中军事条款的权力。许多投票赞成公约的参议员，同时反对以军备供给西欧国家的计划，甚至象康纳利、范登堡和杜勒斯一流的公约支持者也说：批准北大西洋公约并不迫使美国实行军事援助计划。委员会声明又说：美国人民对于他们要被冷战政策拖到何处去表示忧虑，军备计划将导向美国经济的破产，而且不可避免地将使美国迫近战争。
    【新华社北平二十四日电】据法新社纽约讯：美前进步党总统候选人华莱士于二十二日宣称：他将对社鲁门的“军事援外计划”，进行无情的斗争。他将在众院拨款委员会及众院中，进行反对该项计划的斗争。华莱士又称：进步党人相信，通往和平的道路，是要经过联合国的，他们反对这种不正当的援外拨款，这种拨款将引起全世界的军备竞赛。
