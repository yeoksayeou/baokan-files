　　How I Work as a Principal (Continued 1)
　　by Guo Luowa De Yi
　　(II) Supervision
    The principal has many direct and indirect methods of supervision. How to make more use of certain methods, less use of other methods, and combine them, etc., is a matter of the principal's experience and ability.
    The main ones among these methods are obtaining direct impressions from observing classroom situations, group learning, meetings of the Communist Youth League Committee and the Young Pioneers Committee, and from attending Young Pioneers and their detachment meetings, meetings of various subject committees, and meetings of students at all levels. Observing students' behavior on the streets, in classrooms, during breaks, at gatherings, and at evening parties, and observing the work of teachers and students on duty, etc., are all of great significance.
    Among other methods of leadership and supervision, I believe that individual conversations with teachers, grade supervisors, group tutors, leaders of associations and subject committees are of paramount importance. In order to obtain good results, it is necessary to consider and prepare the content of these conversations in advance, think clearly about the purpose of the conversation and what kind of gains you want. Random conversations, of course, are of little benefit.
    To show how I arrange my time in order to carry out effective supervision and leadership, I am citing an example of my preparation schedule for a work week here.
    On Mondays, I listen to reports from first-grade teachers, mentors of teaching groups (there are several in total), secretaries of the Communist Youth League Committee, and chairpersons of the student committee.
    On Tuesdays, I have conversations with grade supervisors of the fifth and second grades, mentors of literature groups (also several in total), older Young Pioneers leaders, and chairpersons of the Young Pioneers Committee.
    On Wednesdays, I meet with grade supervisors of the sixth and third grades, mentors of technical groups, and chairpersons of various subject committees.
    On Thursdays, grade supervisors of the seventh and fourth grades, mentors of art groups and sports groups, full-time teachers in charge of wall newspapers, and librarians come to me for conversations.
    On Fridays, I talk with grade supervisors and teachers of various subjects in the ninth and tenth grades. A meeting is held, presided over by the principal, with the participation of the dean of academic affairs, leaders of the school's Party organization, and the chairperson of the local trade union committee.
    On Saturdays, we do not hold any meetings. Teachers have ample opportunity to use the whole day for self-study in addition to their teaching time.
    When having individual conversations with teachers or group tutors, I usually familiarize myself with their journals, notebooks, and work plans, discuss the grades and achievements of the whole grade and individual students, and talk about the educational work in the grade. It is here that we decide what methods to take for certain students, which students' homes to visit, what kind of help to give to whom, what kind of parents have come to see whom and why they were invited to the school. We also talk about more general problems, clarifying, for example, what is done well or not well, what hinders the work, and what promotes the work. Since every teacher has some public tasks, the progress of their performance of these tasks is also clarified here.
    We hold meetings presided over by the principal with the grade supervisors, group tutors, and leaders of various subject committees. These meetings are held by each type of worker once or twice a month. We usually listen to reports from one or two workers at such meetings. In this way, we both supervise their work and exchange experiences. We do not make any records. Our decisions and appointments are recorded by me in my work diary. If the problem is very important for the whole school, then it is always made into an order or instruction and announced to the whole school.
    When the Education Committee holds meetings, in addition to listening to theoretical and general problems of our practice, it also listens to reports from grade supervisors, leaders of internal organizations, and group tutors. However, the Education Committee usually only discusses these reports when it has comprehensively studied the problem and already has a draft proposal; in other words, when it is convinced that the problem is truly urgent and solving it realistically will indeed benefit the public cause.
    Supervision of school work can only achieve its purpose if it is constant and uninterrupted and can prevent errors or omissions. If supervision only summarizes errors and shortcomings, then supervision is almost useless. Even just a moment of relaxation, supervision will not achieve its purpose. In my opinion, it is completely obvious that without proper supervision or with weak supervision of the execution of work, the creative potential of the teaching staff will usually diminish. In this case, the teaching staff will not grow and consolidate. In addition, the teaching staff often falls into narrow pragmatic problems, leading to disputes.
    Checking students' notebooks is the most important thing. It is naturally impossible for one person to check all the notebooks, but checking is extremely necessary. I started by adopting a method of randomly checking notebooks of each grade. But for the pending assignments of the graduating classes, I completely check them once every quarter. We also use mutual checking to attract teachers of parallel classes to participate in checking notebooks. After completing the work, these teachers submit a brief written evaluation to me.
    In order not to miss important matters and to understand the progress of teaching work seriously, I keep a diary. There are no special columns in the diary. For example, I only record: Monday, October 10th. Held a meeting of leaders of various subject committees from the fifth to tenth grades. Made a report to so-and-so, discussed what, decided what to do, entrusted what: I also leave some space to prepare to record the scores for inspection or execution. This kind of record is not much every day, if not counting the detailed records of observing classroom situations.
    Every time I observe a classroom situation, I always have a conversation with the teacher at the end. We study the good and bad aspects of the classroom situation in detail, compare the classroom situation with the work plan, and discuss how to better conduct the talk about the class. I often invite teachers to observe my classroom situations.
    Naturally, any supervision will cause certain results and conclusions. Suggestions, preventions, punishments, and rewards are the products of supervision. And these products only become public property when they have been finally tested, measured, and considered.
    I only adopt administrative penalties in special cases. I issue orders about rewards twice a year, the first time is before the school anniversary (late January to early February), and the second time is before the summary of the school year. At the production meeting at the end of the school year, I announce the characteristics of production to all teachers.

　　（二）监督
    校长有许多直接和间接的监督方法。多利用某些方法，少利用其他方法，把它们结合起来等等，便是校长的经验和本领的问题。
    这些方法中的主要的，便是从察看上课情况，小组学习，共青团委员会会议和儿童团委员会会议，及从出席儿童团及其支队集会、各学科委员会会议、各级学生会议之中取得直接的印象。观察学生在街道上，在教室中，在休息时间内，在集会上和在晚会上的行为，观察值班教师及学生的工作等等，都是有很大意义的。
    在其他的领导和监督方法中，我认为与教师，级任导师，小组导师，社团和各学科委员会领导人进行个别谈话是有头等意义的。为了获得良好的结果，必需事先考虑和准备这些谈话的内容，想清楚谈话的目的和想要些什么收获。随便乱谈，当然很少益处。
    为了表明我怎样安排自己的时间以便进行得力的监督与领导，我在这里引用我一个工作周的准备安排为例。
    星期一，我听取第一级的教师、教学小组（共有数个）导师、共青团委员会书记与学生委员会主席等人的汇报。
    星期二，与第五级和第二级的级任导师、文学小组（也共有数个）导师，年长的儿童团领导者及儿童团委员会主席等人进行交谈。
    星期三，我接见第六级和第三级的级任导师，各技术小组导师和各学科委员会主席。
    星期四，第七级和第四级的级任导师、艺术小组和体育小组导师，墙报专任教师、图书馆管理员等人来我这里谈话。
    星期五，与第九级和第十级的级任导师及各学科的教师谈话。举行校长所主持的会议，有教务主任、学校党组织领导人，职工会地方委员会主席参加。
    星期六，我们不举行任何会议。教师除了上课时间以外，有充分的可能利用整日时间从事自修。
    在和教师或小组导师进行个别谈话时，我通常在熟悉他们的杂志，练习本和工作计划，谈论全级和各学生的成绩，谈论级上的教育工作。我们就在这里决定：对某某学生采取什么办法，到这些学生中谁的家里去访问，对谁给予什么帮助，什么样的家长来看过谁和为什么被邀到学校里来。我们也谈到较一般的问题，弄清楚例如什么做得好或不好，什么阻碍工作，什么促进工作。由于每一个教师都有一些公共任务，所以在这里也弄清楚他们执行这些任务的进度。
    我们举行由校长主持的级任导师、小组导师及各学科委员会领导人的会议。这些会议每月分别由每一类的工作者举行一两次。我们通常在这种会议上听取一两个工作者的汇报。这样，我们既监督了他们的工作，又交换了经验。我们不作任何记录。我们的决定和委任，由我记入自己的工作日记中。假如问题对于全校都很重要，那末，从来便把它作成命令或指令通告全校。
    教育委员会在举行会议时除听取理论及我们实践的一般问题外，还听取级任导师、校内组织领导人与小组导师的汇报。但教育委员会讨论这些汇报，通常只是在全面研究过问题，并已有了建议草案的时候；换句话说，在确信问题真正紧迫，实事求是地予以解决后确实会对公共事业有益的时候。
    对于学校工作的监督，只有在监督经常而不间断，并能防止错误或疏忽的情况下，才能达到目的。如果监督只是总结错误和缺点，则监督几乎是无用的。甚至只松懈一阵子，监督便已达不到目的了。在我看来，这是完全明显的：对于执行工作没有适当的监督或监督不强，通常便会使教员集体的创造可能性衰减。在这种情况下，教员集体便不成长不巩固了。此外，教员集体往往还会陷入狭隘的实利问题中，致起争执。
    检查学生的练习本，这是最重要的事情。一个人去检查全部练习本，自然是力量做不到的，但检查却是极其必要的。我开始采用了抽查各级练习本的方法。但对于毕业班次的待查作业，我每季都完全检查一次。我们也用相互检查的方式吸引各平行班次的教师参加检查练习本，这些教师在完成工作后，便向我提出一个简短的书面总评。
    为了不错过大事和认真明了教学工作的进行，我记着日记。日记中没有什么特别栏。例如只这样记：星期一，十月十日。举行第五级至第十级各学科委员会领导人会议。向某某做报告，讨论了什么，决定做什么，委托了什么：我还留下一些地位准备记关于检查或执行的分数。这种记载每天是不多的，如果不算关于察看上课情况的详细记载的话。
    每一次察看上课情况，最后都一定和教师交谈一下。我们详细地研究上课情况的好的和不好的方面，把上课情况和工作计划比较一下，并讨论怎样才能更好地进行谈课。我常常邀请教师去察看我的上课情况。
    自然，任何监督都会引起一定的结果与结论。建议、预防、处罚和奖励，便是监督的产物。而这些产物只有在最后考验过，衡量过和考虑过的，才会成为公共的财产。
    只是在特殊的情况下，我才采用行政处分的办理。我一年发布两次关于奖励的命令，第一次是在校庆日前（一月底至二月初），第二次是在一学年的总结前。在一学年告终时的生产会议上，我向全体教师宣布生产的特性。
