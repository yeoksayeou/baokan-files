Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 14th: The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Second Congress passed the following resolution on the report of the activities of the WFTU and the central organizations of trade unions of various countries to defend the economic and social interests of the working people:

(1) The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions points out that the WFTU and the central organizations of trade unions of various countries have been conducting and are conducting unremitting struggles to fulfill the program adopted by the London World Trade Union Congress and the Paris WFTU Congress to defend the economic and social interests of the working people.

The WFTU has raised the issue of equal pay for equal work to the United Nations, supported the struggle of workers in various countries to improve their living standards, and organized international movements to support the strikes of French miners, American dockworkers, Canadian seamen, and workers in various countries. The WFTU has tasked the central organizations of trade unions in the suzerain states with assisting trade unions in colonial countries, which are fighting to improve the economic and social conditions of the colonies and to oppose discrimination based on race, gender, and religious belief.

(2) In the first period after the end of the war, trade unions in several capitalist countries achieved certain victories in improving the economic conditions of the working people. These are manifested in the enactment of laws in some countries establishing enterprise management committees, prohibiting the dismissal of workers, increasing wages due to high living costs, implementing unemployment relief, and paying wages during holidays. However, as a result of the monopolistic capitalists' offensive against the living standards of the working people, the material situation of the masses of people in capitalist countries has deteriorated greatly.

(3) The Marshall Plan, imposed on Western European countries by American imperialism, has caused massive unemployment and mass poverty, and has made the Marshallized countries lose their independence, with their national industries shrinking. The Marshall Plan has also worsened the living standards of the American working class.

(4) The deterioration of the economic situation of the working people in capitalist countries is accompanied by the reactionaries strengthening their attacks on the democratic rights and freedoms of the working class. Many countries are preparing many anti-labor laws, imitating the example of the Taft-Hartley Act currently in force in the United States. In these countries, strikes have become illegal, and retaliation against trade union organizations is becoming more brutal.

(5) The economic and social conditions of the working people in colonies and dependent countries are particularly difficult. There, forced labor still exists in various forms, and the exploitation of the working class is further deepened by discrimination based on race, gender, and age; there, free trade unions are persecuted by the government, and their leaders are subjected to horrific retaliation.

Discrimination in labor and wages based on race and nationality exists not only in the colonies but also in the United States.

(6) The Congress pays tribute to the democratic trade unions of France, Italy, India, Latin America, and other capitalist and colonial countries, which heroically defend the economic and social rights of the working people in the face of the beastly retaliation of the bourgeois governments and the sabotage activities of reformists and government-supported trade unions.

  Soviet Working People
  Material and Cultural Welfare Rising Daily
  Trade Union Congress Unanimously Satisfied

(7) The Congress notes with satisfaction the daily rise in the material and cultural welfare of the Soviet working people. These achievements are guaranteed by the socialist nature of the Soviet state, where private ownership of the means of production no longer exists, and where there is no contradiction between the government and the workers. The Soviet trade unions play an active role in socialist construction, ensuring the improvement of the living standards of all the working people in the country.

(8) The people's democratic countries, which have embarked on the road of socialist development, have achieved considerable success in improving the economic situation of the working people and in protecting their social rights. These achievements are manifested in the implementation of the principle of equal pay for equal work, in the implementation and development of national social insurance and progressive labor legislation, in the elimination of unemployment in the people's democratic countries, and in the increase of the real wages and living standards of the working people.

(9) The resolutions of the London World Trade Union Congress and the Paris WFTU Congress listed the tasks facing the national trade union central organizations of all countries in their activities to protect the economic and social interests of the working people.

The current Congress calls on the national trade union central organizations of various countries and the trade unions of the world to carry out these resolutions and to wage a resolute struggle against employers and bourgeois governments shifting the entire burden of the looming economic crisis onto the working class.

The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions believes that the further consolidation of the unity of the working class trade unions and the consolidation of the World Federation of Trade Unions are the main weapons in the struggle to improve the economic and social conditions of the working people and to oppose the intensified attacks of capital.

The Congress urges trade unions in various countries to fight for the economic independence of their respective countries and to maintain and develop national industries; maintaining and developing national industries is the only way to victoriously clarify the post-war economic dismemberment, improve the living standards of the masses, and reduce military budgets.

Trade unions in various countries must fight for the economic independence of colonies and dependent countries, against forced slave labor in capitalist and colonial countries, and against discrimination against workers based on age, gender, race, or nationality.

Trade unions in various countries must fight to abolish anti-labor legislation, to stipulate shorter working days, to establish unemployment relief and social insurance funded by the state and employers, free medical treatment, paid holidays, and the promulgation of progressive social legislation such as full employment, and to oppose freezing and reducing wages and increase real wages.

(10) The Congress instructs the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions to widely publicize the program for defending the economic and social interests of the working people adopted by the London World Trade Union Congress and the Paris WFTU Congress, which reflects the social and economic reforms and the experience of the working class struggle in the previous period.

(11) The Congress instructs the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions to establish an International Labor People's Solidarity Fund to assist trade union organizations in various countries. This fund is voluntarily donated by trade union organizations, trade union members, individuals, and groups who support the working class in its struggle for its own immediate interests.

　　世界工联代表大会通过决议
  　保卫劳动人民利益
    支持各国工人为改进生活水平而斗争
    【新华社北平十四日电】塔斯社米兰讯：世界工联第二届代表大会对世界工联与各国职工会中央机构为保卫劳动人民经济与社会利益所进行的活动的报告，通过决议如下：
    （一）世界工联第二届代表大会指出：世界工联及各国职工会中央机构，为履行伦敦世界职工会大会和巴黎世界工联代表大会所通过的保卫劳动人民经济与社会利益的纲领，已经进行而且正在进行着不屈不挠的斗争。
    世界工联向联合国组织提出了同工同酬的问题，支持各国工人为改进其生活水平的奋斗，组织了声援法国矿工、美国码头工人、加拿大海员及各国工人阶级队伍所进行的罢工的国际运动。世界工联对各宗主国的职工会中央机构，提出了援助殖民地国家中职工会的任务，这些职工会正为改善殖民地经济与社会状况，反对以种族、性别和宗教信仰为理由的歧视而斗争。
    （二）在战争结束后的第一段时期，若干资本主义国家的职工会，在改善劳动人民的经济条件上获得了某些胜利，这些表现在某些国家颁布了建立企业管理委员会，禁止解雇工人，因生活费用高昂而增加工资，实行失业救济与假日照付工资等等法令。然而，由于独占资本家对劳动人民生活水平发动进攻的结果，资本主义国家的人民大众的物质境遇已大为恶化。
    （三）美国帝国主义所强加于西欧国家的马歇尔计划，引起了大批失业与群众的贫困，使马歇尔化各国丧失了独立，其民族工业正在减缩中。马歇尔计划也使美国工人阶级的生活水平恶化了。
    （四）资本主义各国劳动人民经济境遇的恶化，伴随着反动派加强对工人阶级的民主权利与自由的进攻。许多国家正仿效美国现行的塔夫脱——哈特莱法的榜样，准备了许多反劳工法。在这些国家里，罢工已成为非法，对职工会组织的报复正变得更加残酷。
    （五）殖民地和附属国内劳动人民的经济和社会状况尤其艰难。在那里，强迫劳动仍然以各种不同的形式存在着，而且因种族、性别和年龄上的歧视而对工人阶级的剥削益加深重；在那里，自由职工会受到政府的迫害，而它们的领袖们遭到骇人听闻的报复。
    由于种族与国籍的理由而在劳动和工资方面加以歧视的现象，不仅存在于殖民地，并且也存在于美国。
    （六）大会向法、意、印度、拉丁美洲及其他资本主义与殖民地国家的民主职工会致敬，它们在资产阶级政府兽性的报复和改良主义者及政府御用职工会进行破坏活动的环境下，英雄地进行保卫劳动人民经济与社会权利的斗争。
  　苏联劳动人民
  　物质文化福利日益上升
  　工联代表大会一致满意
    （七）代表大会满意地注意到苏联劳动人民的物质与文化福利之日益上升。这些成就已由苏维埃国家社会主义的性质所保证着，在那里，生产工具和生产手段的私有权已经不存在，在那里，政府和工人之间没有矛盾。苏联职工会在保证提高全国劳动人民生活水准的社会主义建设中，起着积极的作用。
    （八）已经走上社会主义的发展道路的人民民主国家，其职工会在改善劳动人民的经济情况和在保护他们社会权利方面，业已获得相当大的成就。这些成就表现在生活中实行同工同酬的原则，表现在实行与发展国家社会保险和进步的劳动立法，表现在人民民主国家内失业的消除，表现在劳动人民实际工资和生活水准的提高。
    （九）伦敦世界职工会大会和巴黎世界工联代表大会的决议，列举了一切国家的全国性职工会中央机构在他们保护劳动人民经济和社会利益的活动方面所面临的任务。
    本届大会号召各全国性职工会中央机构与世界各国职工会为执行这些决议，为反对雇主与资产阶级政府把全部迫在眉睫的经济危机的重担转嫁到工人阶级身上，而进行坚决的斗争。
    世界工联第二届代表大会认为，工人阶级职工会团结的进一步巩固，世界工联的巩固，是争取劳动人民经济与社会条件的改善，反对资本加紧进攻的斗争中的主要武器。
    大会敦促各国职工会为各该国的经济独立，为保持与发展民族工业而斗争；保持与发展民族工业，是胜利地澄清战后经济肢解，提高人民群众的生活水平，缩减军事预算的唯一方法。
    各国职工会必须进行斗争，争取殖民地与附属国的经济独立，反对资本主义与殖民地各国强迫的奴隶劳动，反对以年龄、性别、种族或国籍为理由的对工人的歧视。
    各国职工会必须进行斗争，以废除反劳工立法，争取规定缩短工作日，建立失业救济和由国家与雇主出资的社会保险，免费医药治疗，假日照付工资，充分就业等项进步的社会立法之颁布，反对冻结与减低工资，增加实际工资。
    （十）大会指示世界工联执行局广泛公布伦敦世界职工会大会及巴黎世界工联代表大会所通过的保卫劳动人民经济与社会利益的纲领，在这个纲领中，反映着社会与经济的改革，以及在前此时期内工人阶级斗争的经验。
    （十一）大会指示世界工联执委会设立援助各国职工会组织的国际劳动人民团结基金，这一基金是由那些支持工人阶级为它自己的切身利益而斗争的职工会组织、职工会会员、个人与团体自愿献纳的。
