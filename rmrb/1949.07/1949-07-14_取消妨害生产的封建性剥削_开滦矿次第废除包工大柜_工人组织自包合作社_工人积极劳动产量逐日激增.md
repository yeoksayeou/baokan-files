[From Our Correspondent] Reporter Lin Li reports: A mass movement to abolish the Contractor Foremen system—a system of layer upon layer of exploitation—and to establish worker-organized self-contracting production cooperatives has unfolded step by step across the five Kailuan mines. Free from the shackles of the Contractor Foremen, miners are engaging in production labor with great joy and enthusiasm. The Contractor Foremen system was an organization entrusted by the Kailuan mine authorities to concentrate workers' labor and sell it to Kailuan; conversely, the Kailuan mine authorities used it to manage and control the workers, making it one of the tools of their rule over the workers. The five Kailuan mines have a total of over 47,000 workers, of whom 70 to 80 percent are slaves (outsiders) employed by more than 30 Contractor Foremen. Taking Tangshan Mine, which has 11,155 workers, as an example, 8,447 workers were controlled by eleven Contractor Foremen. The Contractor Foremen signed coal mining contracts with the mine authorities, receiving compensation from the mine authorities based on output. Workers' wages were calculated based on labor time (such as eight hours per shift) through the hands of the Contractor Foremen. The surplus from these two different methods of compensation constituted the Contractor Foremen's profits. To increase these profits, the Contractor Foremen used extremely barbaric and cruel means to force workers to overwork, even driving them to the most dangerous areas to extract coal. The tragic incident on June 26th of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), when 27 workers were buried alive in the mine, occurred under such compulsion. Deaths and injuries from crushing and bumping were even more common. In addition, the mine authorities had a provision for additional bonuses (commonly known as "circle money") for production exceeding a certain quantity, but workers often did not receive them, or received less than half of what the mine authorities issued. In September of last year, Tangshan Mine spent 30,000 yuan (gold yuan) on "circle money," of which workers received 14,800 yuan, and the Contractor Foremen received 15,200 yuan. That is to say, the eleven non-laboring Contractor Foremen received more "circle money" than the more than 8,400 workers who labored all day. There were also various uncountable exploitations: for example, delaying the payment of workers' wages to lend money at interest, and hoarding goods for speculation when prices fluctuated, were commonplace. To maintain this illegal extraction, the Contractor Foremen colluded with the mine police with gold bars and beauties. Japanese commanders during the Japanese occupation, Kuomintang agents, hooligans, and thugs were also colluded with to serve as armed forces to suppress workers. Workers who dared to resist could be directly sent to prison, court, or even secretly harmed or executed. Therefore, in every Kailuan strike movement, "Down with the Contractor Foremen" was one of the slogans, but under the cloak of darkness, each time it ended with the killing, arrest, or expulsion of workers and their leaders from the mine.

After the liberation of Tangshan, workers successively put forward requests to abolish the Contractor Foremen system. Some staff members even put forward written opinions, saying: Contractor Foremen are not only a slave system that eats workers' flesh and drinks workers' blood, but also play a role in undermining the long-term construction of the mines. The military representatives stationed at Kailuan and the employee preparatory committee accepted the employees' request and, in mid-April, hired 14 underground workers to form a Contractor Foremen Problem Research Association to investigate and understand the situation. Upon learning this, the Contractor Foremen immediately took preemptive measures. Under the leadership of Pan Shaotang, the head of the Contractor Foremen's Association, they converted all of the Chatozi (direct leaders of underground workers), who had previously been daily workers, into monthly workers (monthly workers receive more money), in an attempt to win over the Chatozi and divide worker solidarity. The hooligans and thugs employed by the Contractor Foremen engaged in passive resistance. For example, when repairing roads and building sheds underground, if they needed cement, they sent sand; if they needed sand, they sent loess, in an attempt to obstruct the elimination of the Contractor Foremen system and prove that the worker self-contracting system could not succeed. What the miners found particularly intolerable was that, when wages were distributed on May 4th, they were embezzled to the tune of 8 million yuan (People's Currency). At this time, Kailuan had not paid wages for several months. Enraged, the workers gathered in front of the trade union and demanded an immediate uprising to overthrow the Contractor Foremen. The trade union immediately convened an emergency meeting of representatives and sent representatives to find Pan Shaotang and others, the heads of the Contractor Foremen. When the workers questioned them, Pan and others equivocated and tried to quibble. After various facts were presented and they could not evade the issue, they finally agreed to pay wages on the 8th. Due to their illegal behavior, the representative meeting filed a lawsuit with the court. The court immediately arrested the chief culprits Pan Shaotang and Wang Jieyi, and ordered the others to be released on bail to return to their contracting units to serve the workers well and await takeover; if there was any sabotage, they would be charged with sabotaging production. At this point, the abolition of the Contractor Foremen system began to enter the stage of action.

On May 18th, the Tangshan Mine Employee Preparatory Committee held a formal meeting of representatives, clearly stating that the abolition of the Contractor Foremen system was the current central task. It exposed the conspiracy to split worker solidarity and studied specific working methods and steps. On the basis of the original Contractor Foremen Problem Research Association, seventeen people were formally elected to form an action committee to lead this work. It was decided to start with the third group of Pan Shaotang, the head of the Contractor Foremen's Association, to gain experience and promote it throughout the mine. The general meeting considered it unreasonable to convert the Chatozi to monthly workers and mobilized the Chatozi to change it themselves. At the same time, the military representatives stationed at the mine also provided strong support. The military representatives negotiated with the factory to abolish the Contractor Foremen system and proposed that all the past benefits given to the Contractor Foremen should be given to the workers. The mine authorities promised to comply one by one and guaranteed that the workers would not lose money. Thus, the Employee Preparatory Committee and the committee leading the abolition of the Contractor Foremen system began to work on three fronts: 1. Order the Contractor Foremen to settle accounts and prepare for handover. Warn those who passively resist, provoke, or sabotage. 2. Discuss the organization, personnel selection, and conditions of the worker self-contracting production cooperative. 3. Organize accusations against the crimes of the Contractor Foremen to awaken the workers' class consciousness and national consciousness. As soon as the miners saw real action being taken, they happily shouted, "We've been waiting for this, we've been waiting for the time to overthrow the Contractor Foremen!" Some composed ballads, some wrote articles for the newspapers. Zhang Lianyou, a staff member who was oppressed by the Contractor Foremen, upon hearing that the Contractor Foremen system was being abolished, also automatically organized the previously disorganized documents in a systematic manner and prepared many statistical tables to be used as a basis for improving worker welfare in the future. The Chatozi, who had been fooled by the Contractor Foremen, then returned the money they had received, declaring that they would not accept the bribery of the Contractor Foremen. Underground worker Zhang Fuquan wrote a poem: "Abolish the Contractor Foremen, workers contract together, workers are in high spirits when they hear it, they should dig one pickaxe but dig three. More coal, high bonuses, making meritorious service in developing production." The coal output rate of the underground workers in this group on May 6th was 1.47 cars (420 kilograms per car, the same below) per person per eight hours, but by the end of May it had increased to 2.04 cars, and on June 4th it increased to 2.23 cars, exceeding the Kailuan coal mining standard (756 kilograms) for the past two or three years by 180 kilograms. On June 15th, the 220 workers in the group produced 660 cars of coal a day, averaging three cars per person, breaking through the one-ton mark. The group with the largest increase in production was coal hole number 7544. From May 15th to 20th, the average output per worker was 3.42 cars, equal to 190 percent of the standard output. On May 30th, it reached the highest efficiency – 5.04 cars, equal to three times the standard output. Combining the workers' unprecedented enthusiasm for production, discussions and studies on the establishment of worker self-contracting cooperatives were carried out at the bottom of the 1,200-foot mine, and nine cooperative committee members were elected. On June 22nd, the death of the sinful Contractor Foremen and the birth of the first worker self-contracting production cooperative were formally announced. Then, on the 28th and 29th, with the support of the People's Court, a reasoning conference of more than 300 miner representatives was held to accuse the Contractor Foremen giant Pan Shaotang. At this point, the overthrow of the Contractor Foremen, which the workers had been striving for through bloodshed and sacrifice for many years, was realized for the first time under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the help of the People's Government.

Now, the preparatory committees for abolishing the Contractor Foremen system in each group of Tangshan Mine have been established, and it is planned to complete the takeover in mid-July. The struggle to abolish the Contractor Foremen system has also been launched in Dongshan Mine, and a large movement of tens of thousands of people has begun. Under such circumstances, the Kailuan Employees' Union must not only go to lead the mass movement to abolish the Contractor Foremen system and liberate the miners from the oppression of the Contractor Foremen, but also strengthen the leadership of the new institutions. In the current initial stage of the new institutions, at least the following matters should be handled quickly: 1. Sign a contracting contract with the mine authorities, strive to fully realize the contracting benefits promised by the mine authorities, and ensure that the benefits given by the mine authorities to the Contractor Foremen are unconditionally transferred to the worker self-contracting production cooperative. 2. Quickly discuss and formulate labor discipline, strictly prevent bad elements from sabotaging production. 3. The unreasonable personnel system and wage system left over by the Contractor Foremen should be quickly adjusted without hindering production. 4. With the consent of the mine authorities, establish an underground production management committee to implement democratic management, oppose destructive behaviors to mine construction that only proceed from immediate interests and do not consider long-term plans, so as to ensure long-term construction and long-term development.

Note: "Contractor Foremen" were a type of feudal intermediary exploitation organization that monopolized the contracting of coal miners to the mine authorities in the past coal mine production. Those who ran Contractor Foremen were mostly local bullies who had colluded with bureaucratic capitalists or warlords. They provided some coal mining tools and simple workshops, gathered workers to contract with the mine authorities to mine coal underground. Workers would lose their jobs if they did not go through them and could only endure their cruel exploitation. The most prominent exploitations were three types: (1) The wages prepaid by the mine authorities to the workers could be taken by the Contractor Foremen to lend out at high interest rates or engage in speculative business, and not paid to the workers for half a month, a month, or even longer. (2) The compensation for workers' work-related injuries or deaths, or the wages owed to workers who died of illness, were mostly embezzled by the Contractor Foremen. After the death of workers without families, they were mostly buried casually, and the compensation or wages were all embezzled. (3) Most of the funds, footage fees, etc. that the workers should have received were embezzled and not issued, and false reports were made to the mine authorities about the project.

    【本报讯】记者林里报导：废除层层剥削的包工大柜，成立工人自包生产合作社的群众运动，已在开滦五矿次第展开。挣脱了包工大柜枷锁的矿工们，正以高度的欢欣和积极性进行生产劳动。包工大柜是受开滦矿方委托，将工人的劳动力集中起来卖给开滦的一种组织；反转来，开滦矿方又利用它来管理和控制工人，使它成为自己统治工人的工具之一。开滦五矿共有工人四万七千余，其中百分之七十到八十是被三十多个包工大柜所雇用的奴隶（外工）。以拥有一万一千一百五十五个工人的唐山矿为例，就有八千四百四十七个工人，为十一个包工大柜所控制。包工柜和矿方订立承包采煤合同，是以产量取得矿方报酬，工人的工资，是经过包工柜的手，以劳动时间（如每班八小时）来计算。两种不同的计酬方法所得的剩余，就是包工大柜的利润。为了增加此种利润，包工柜便用极其野蛮残酷的手段，逼迫工人过度劳动，甚而驱使工人到最危险的地带去取煤。三十一年六月二十六日，二十七位工友淤死于矿底的惨案，就是在这种驱使下发生的。平素砸死碰伤者更时有所闻。此外，生产超过一定数量，矿方本有另加奖金（俗称圈钱）的规定，但工友们往往得不到手，或者所得不足矿局所发之半。唐山矿去年九月份开支圈钱三万元（金元），工人得到一万四千八百元，包工所得一万五千二百元。这就是说，十一家不劳动的包工大柜，所得圈钱比终日劳动的八千四百多工人还多。还有各种算不出来的：比如迟发工人工资去放债收息，物价波动时以工资去囤积居奇，更是常事。为了维护这种非法榨取，包工柜便以金条、美女去勾结矿警。日寇统治时代的日军司令、国民党统治时代的特务、流氓、地痞、打手等，也曾被勾结来作为镇压工人的武力。对敢于反抗的工人，他们可以直接送入监狱、法庭、以至暗害、处死。因此，开滦每次罢工运动，“打倒包工大柜”均为口号之一，但在黑暗笼罩之下，每次又都以工人及其领袖的被杀、被捕、被驱逐出矿做了结局。
    唐山解放后，工人纷纷提出取消包工大柜的要求，一些职员还提出了书面意见，他们说：包工不光是吃工人肉，喝工人血的奴役制度，而且起着破坏矿山长期建设的作用。驻开滦军代表与职工筹委会接受职工的请求，于四月中旬聘请了十四位井下工友，成立了包工问题研究会，着手调查研究，了解情况。包工柜得悉，立刻以先发制人的手段，在包工公所首脑潘绍棠领导下，把向为日工的查头子（井下工人的直接领导者）一律改成月工（月工钱多），企图以此拉拢查头，分化工人团结。包工们所雇用的流氓地痞与打手，则消极怠工。如井下修路搭棚时，要洋灰，他们送砂子，要砂子，他们送黄土，企图以此来阻挠取消包工大柜之进行，以此证明工人自包制不能成功。尤其使矿工们不能容忍的，是五月四日发放工资之际，竟克扣工资达八百万元（人民券）之巨。这时，开滦已有几月工资未发，工人愤怒之余，齐集工会门前，要求立即起来打倒包工大柜。工会当即召开紧急代表会，并派代表找来包工头子潘绍棠等人，在工友们提出质问时，潘等支吾搪塞，企图狡辩，后在种种事实证明及无可推拖的情况下，始答应八日照发工资。由于他们这种犯法行为，代表会向法院提出控告。法院当即将首要分子潘绍棠、王节一二人拘捕，其他令其取保回柜，好好服务，等待接管；如有破坏情事，当以破坏生产论罪。至此，取消包工大柜即开始步入行动的阶段。
    唐矿职工筹委会于五月十八日召开正式代表会，明确提出取消包工大柜为目前中心工作。对阴谋分裂工人团结的勾当做了揭发，并研究了具体工作的方式方法与步骤。在原来包工问题研究会的基础上，正式选举出十七人，为领导是项工作的行动委员会。决议先从包工公所首脑潘绍棠的第三组做起，以取得经验，推广全矿。查头子改月工，大会认为不合理，动员查头自己改过来。同时，驻矿军代表亦做了有力的支援。军代表向厂方交涉取消包工大柜，并提出过去给包工的一切好处，要一律发给工人。矿方一一允诺，并保证不叫工人赔钱。于是，职工筹委会及领导取消包工大柜的委员会即从三方面着手工作：一、责令包工大柜结帐，准备移交。对消极怠工、挑拨破坏者予以警告。二、讨论工人自包生产合作社组织、人选及条件。三、组织控诉包工大柜之罪行，启发工人阶级觉悟与民族觉悟。矿工们一见真的行动起来，均欢欣鼓舞的喊着：“可盼到了，可盼到打倒包工大柜的时候了！”有的编快板、有的给报纸写稿，包工大柜受压迫的职员张连有一听说取消包工大柜，也自动把过去杂乱无章的文件，有系统的整理起来，还作了许多统计表，准备将来做增进工人福利的依据。受包工大柜愚弄的查头子，这时纷纷把拿到手的钱退出来，声明不受包工之贿赂。井下工友张福泉写诗：“取消包工大柜，工人大伙包，工友一听情绪高，该刨一镐刨三镐。多出煤、红利高，发展生产立功劳。”该组井下工友，五月六日每人每八小时的出煤率还是一点四七车（每车四二○公斤，下同），到五月底已增为二点零四车，六月四日增至二点二三车，超过开滦煤二三年来采煤标准（七五六公斤）一八○公斤。六月十五日，该组二百二十个工人一天出煤六百六十车，平均每人达三车，突破了一吨的数量。增产最多的是该组七五四四号煤洞，五月十五至二十日，每工平均产三点四二车，等于标准产量的百分之一百九十。五月三十日竟达最高效率——五点零四车，等于标准产量的三倍。结合着工人们空前未有的生产热情，在一千二百英尺的井底，展开了成立工人自包合作社的讨论与研究，并选出了九名社务委员。六月二十二日，正式宣布了罪恶的包工大柜之死亡，工人自包第一生产合作社的诞生。接着，二十八、九两日，在人民法院支持下，召开了三百多矿工代表的控诉包工巨头潘绍棠的说理大会。至此，多少年来工人们以流血牺牲所努力争取的打倒包工大柜，在共产党的领导与人民政府帮助下第一次实现了。
    现在，唐山矿各组取消包工大柜的筹委会均已成立，拟在七月中旬接管完毕；东三矿也展开了取消包工大柜的斗争，几万人的大运动已经开始。在这种情况下，开滦职工会一方面必须前去领导取消包工大柜的群众运动，把矿工从包工的压榨下解放出来；另方面又必须加强对新机构的领导。在新机构初建的目前，至少应当迅速办理下列几件事：１、和矿方订立承包合同，争取矿方所允诺的承包利益全部实现，做到矿方所给予包工大柜的好处，无条件的转给工人自包生产合作社。２、迅速讨论与制订劳动纪律，严防坏分子破坏生产。３、包工大柜所遗留下的不合理的人事制度，工资制度，在不妨碍生产的条件下，迅速予以调整。４、在矿方同意下，建立井下生产管理委员会，实行民主管理，反对只从眼前利益出发，不做长期打算的对矿山建设的破坏行为，以保障长期建设与长期发展。
    　　　　
    按：“包工柜”是过去煤矿生产中垄断采煤工人向矿方包工的一种带封建性的中间剥削机构。办包工柜的人，多是与官僚资本或军阀有勾结的土劣。他们置备一部分采煤工具和简陋的工房，召集工人向矿方包工下井采煤，工人不通过它就要失业，只有忍受它的残酷剥削。其剥削最显著的有三种：（一）矿方预支给工人的工资，包工柜掌柜的可以拿去放高利贷或干投机倒把生意，半月、一月，甚至更长时间不发给工人。（二）工人因公伤亡的抚恤金，或疾病死亡欠下工人的工资，大部为包工柜克扣。无家属的工人死亡后，则多席卷埋掉，抚恤金或工资即全部贪污。（三）工人应得的资金进尺费等大部克扣不发，并向矿方假报工程。
