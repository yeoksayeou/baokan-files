"China Youth" No. 12 Editorial

Recently, the Chinese Communist Party's branches in Beiping (Beijing) have publicly disclosed their members. This is a major event. Making the Party public is to establish closer ties with the broad masses of people. In all liberated areas, keeping the Party secret only increases unnecessary suspicion among the masses. After the Party members are made public, their excellent qualities and exemplary behavior will make it easier for the masses to further understand the Party, and make it easier for the Party to unite and educate the masses. On the other hand, if there are shortcomings, it will be easier to receive supervision and help from the masses. Therefore, in all places where secrecy is unnecessary, the Party's public disclosure is a sign of a revolutionary organization, and it is the revolutionary organization's attitude of being responsible to the people; conversely, keeping secret is avoiding the masses, separating from the masses, and a manifestation of distrusting the masses.

Some people worry that individual branches or Party members have errors and shortcomings, and that public disclosure will affect the Party's prestige; some people worry that Party members' theoretical understanding is poor and they will be unable to answer questions from the masses. We believe that individual branches or Party members with errors and shortcomings should make self-criticisms and ask the masses for their opinions in order to correct their own errors and shortcomings. Using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to correct shortcomings will only further enhance the Party's prestige. As for Party members with a weaker theoretical basis, they should honestly admit to the masses that their theoretical level is insufficient and that they will work hard to study in the future.

However, making the Party public is not for the sake of being public. We disagree with delaying public disclosure under the pretext of insufficient publicity and preparation, or the timing not being right. At the same time, we also disagree with simple methods such as simply posting a list without proper publicity and preparation within and outside the Party, or extravagant practices of being busy all day for the sake of making the branch public. We must treat making the Party public as an educational task for Party members and the masses.

The Chinese New Democratic Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and its relationship with the Communist Party is very close. After the Party branches are made public, League members will be more easily educated by the Party, and the Party's leadership over the League will be strengthened. Therefore, every League member should warmly welcome and fully support the Party's public disclosure. After the Party is made public, League members should publicize the Party's great contributions to the people and the exemplary deeds of Party members among the masses. They should also set an example by working with the masses to offer correct opinions to the Party, so that the individual errors and shortcomings of the Party branches can be quickly overcome. On the other hand, they must also persuade and explain some incorrect opinions among the masses. After the Party branches in Beiping were made public, most League members adopted the correct attitude mentioned above. However, some individual League members also felt that in public occasions with the masses in the future, League members were one level lower than Party members, and their work became somewhat passive. This is a completely wrong view. All our League members must understand: First, the League is the Party's reserve force and should unconditionally accept the Party's leadership; second, whether Party members or League members are doing work, it is all for the purpose of serving the people better and more, not for showing off or competing for position. Therefore, there is fundamentally no such thing as being "one level higher" or "one level lower". There are also individual League members who, because individual Party members have shortcomings, mistakenly say: "How is the Party compared to the League? How is the League compared to the Party?" This is also incorrect. Individual Party members with shortcomings or errors cannot represent the entire Party organization. The Party organization is to correct the shortcomings or errors of these Party members. In this work, League members should of course provide well-intentioned and realistic help. As for some League members and the masses who meet the requirements for joining the Party and urgently request to join the Party, then we should of course suggest that the Party absorb them into the Party. There are also some League members who agree with the Party's public disclosure, but their views are incorrect. They believe that in the past, when the League came forward and did something wrong, only the League had to bear the responsibility. Now that the Party is public, the Party can bear the responsibility for any wrongdoings. This is also a wrong view. Every League member must recognize that the glory of the Party is the glory of the League, and must regard the Party and the League, and the Party and the masses, as a single entity. The League and the masses must help the Party well, and the Party must strengthen its leadership and education of the League and maintain close ties with the masses. Whether it is the Party or the League, whether there are shortcomings or errors in the work, they must be overcome by using the method of criticism and self-criticism, and absolutely no mutual evasion of responsibility is allowed.

### 青年团员对公开党应有的认识

　　青年团员对公开党应有的认识
    “中国青年”第十二期社论
    最近，中国共产党北平市的支部的党员公开了。这是一件大事。公开党是为了和广大的人民群众取得更密切的联系。凡是已经解放的地方，党不公开，只有使群众增加不必要的怀疑。党员公开以后，他们的优秀品质和模范行为，使群众容易进一步的认识党，使党更容易团结与教育群众。另一方面，如果有缺点，也更容易受到群众的监督与帮助。因此，在一切没有必要秘密的地方，党的公开，是革命组织的标志，是革命组织对人民负责的态度；反之，秘密起来是躲避群众，是脱离群众，是不信任群众的表现。
    有人怕个别支部或党员有错误与缺点，公开了会影响党的威信；有人怕党员理论差，答复不了群众的问题。我们认为个别有错误与缺点的支部或党员，正应该作自我批评，并请群众提出意见，以便改正他自己的错误和缺点，这样使用批评和自我批评的武器来改正缺点，只有使党的威信更加提高·至于理论差一些的党员，也应该向群众老老实实承认自己的理论水平不够，今后努力学习。
    但是公开党不是为公开而公开。我们不同意借口宣传酝酿，时机不到而拖延公开，同时也不同意不经过适当的在党内外的宣传酝酿，只是贴出一张名单就行的简单方式，或是整天为公开支部而忙碌的铺张做法。我们要把公开党当作对党员和群众的一种教育工作来做。
    中国新民主主义青年团是中国共产党领导下的先进青年的群众性的组织，和共产党的关系是很密切的。党支部公开以后，团员更易于受到党的教育，党对团的领导将更会加强。因此，每个团员对于党的公开，应该是十分欢迎十分拥护的。在党公开了以后，团员应在群众中宣传党对人民的伟大贡献，党员的模范事迹。并以身作则地和群众在一起向党提出正确的意见，使党支部的个别的错误与缺点得到迅速克服。而另一方面对群众中的一些不正确的意见，也必须进行说服与解释。在北平公开党的支部以后，大多数团员是采取了上述的正确态度。但有个别团员也感到今后在群众的公开的场合中，团员比党员低了一层，工作有些消极，这是一种完全错误的看法。我们全体团员必须了解：第一，团是党的后备军，应当无条件地接受党的领导；第二，无论党员或者团员做工作，都是为了更好与更多地为人民服务，而不是为了出风头与争地位，因此，根本没有什么叫做高一层或低一层。还有个别的团员，因为个别的党员有缺点，因而错误地说：“党比团如何？团比党如何？”这也是不对的。个别有缺点或错误的党员，不能代表整个党的组织。党的组织是要纠正这些党员的缺点或错误的，在这工作中，团员当然应该给以善意的实事求是的帮助。至于有一些团员和群众具有入党条件，并迫切要求入党，那么，我们也当然应该建议党去吸收他们入党。还有一些团员赞成党公开，但看法不对，他们认为过去团出面，做了错事只有团担当，现在党公开了，有了错事可以由党担当了。这也是一种错误看法。每一个团员要认识到党的光荣就是团的光荣，要把党和团、党和群众看成一体。团和群众要好好帮助党，党要加强对团的领导与教育，密切联系群众。无论是党或团，无论在工作中有了缺点或错误，就要用批评与自我批评的方法来克服，而绝不容许互相推卸责任。
