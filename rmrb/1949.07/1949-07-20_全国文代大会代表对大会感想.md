    I think this congress was very successful. The representatives who attended were widespread, yet all very enthusiastic. The congress lasted for half a month, and throughout that time, it was united in a harmonious and pleasant spirit, unanimously studying and learning Chairman Mao's literary direction of serving the masses of the people. There is a reason for this. First, the congress happened to take place at a time when the People's Liberation Army had achieved successive great victories, and the Chinese democratic revolution had therefore achieved basic success; second, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao gave special care and love to literary and art workers, and the people of the whole country gave warm encouragement, which were the main reasons for the success of the congress. All the representatives, whether from the newly liberated areas or the old liberated areas, felt indescribable excitement at Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's personal speeches, considering it an unparalleled honor; they sincerely expressed their warm gratitude to Vice Chairman Zhou's painstaking six-hour-long report, considering it the most correct explanation and specific instruction of Chairman Mao's literary direction. I believe that after this congress, the new literature and art of New Democracy, through the route of popularization and improvement, will soon have great development.
    Zhang Zhixiang
    This is a congress of unity and a congress of progress. After the meeting, we will surely see the great march of the national literary and art circles and the brilliant achievements of people's literature and art under the banner of Mao Zedong.
    Bai Yang
    This is an unprecedented great unity. From the old liberated areas of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia to Hong Kong and Hainan, from the old seniors in their sixties and seventies to the young literary and art new forces in their twenties, representatives from various departments, various industries, and various forms have come to participate in this grand meeting, expressing their determination to participate in literary and national construction under the banner of Mao Zedong. In such a united mass scene, I only feel that the individual is too small, and there is no other idea except to contribute all my meager strength.
    Mei Lanfang
    I feel very happy and excited to participate in this literary congress.
    What I saw in the venue was light, unity, and an atmosphere of auspiciousness, which enveloped the entire venue and generated a living, fresh force. I was encouraged, and I felt that this short month of study brought back my lost youth, and I felt much younger.
    Many leaders and experts attach such importance to the dramas we perform. They repeatedly praised, encouraged, and enlightened Mr. Lanfang's meager contributions to society over the decades, which made me feel even more ashamed.
    In the future, I will follow Chairman Mao's thinking and move forward in a down-to-earth manner based on what I have learned from this study, to achieve the goal of serving the people.
    Zhou Xinfang
    This time, I came to participate in the unprecedented literary congress, preparing to learn to serve the people. Listening to the grand discussions on drama from all aspects, they all said that local opera has deep roots among the people and a large audience base. Reforming old opera is seen as one of the main tasks. This makes old opera practitioners feel grateful and motivated. Although I have seen, heard, and learned a lot in this month, I always feel that it is not enough. We should naturally work hard to learn more so that old opera can merge with the times.
    Ba Jin
    I am not here to speak at this conference, I am here to learn. And this is the first time I have participated in such a large-scale gathering. I have indeed gained a lot from this conference.
    First, I saw how people combined art and life, mixed words and sweat to create some beautiful, healthy and powerful works, and the soul of the new China radiated light from them.
    Second, for many years I have been writing with a pen, and I often lament that my works are weak and powerless, and I constantly complain that I want to put down my pen. Now I have found that there are indeed many people who not only use pens, but also use actions, blood, and life to complete their works. Those works have inspired countless people and awakened them to participate in the cause of revolution, and they will also educate more young souls.
    Third, I felt the warmth of friendship. Every time I walked into the venue, I had a feeling of returning to my old home. At least half of the seven hundred faces were faces that I had never seen before, but they were not strangers to me. All I saw were sincere and kind faces. I talked, discussed, listened to reports, and exchanged experiences as if I were living among my own brothers, and I didn't feel any restraint. Free, frank, without the slightest estrangement, as if seven hundred people had the same heart.
    Luo Binji
    This conference is indeed "a very good conference," a conference unprecedented in history, a conference glittering with glory due to the victory of the Chinese Communist Party, "a conference needed by the people."
    It is necessary for literary and art workers to unite and sincerely study how to serve the people. It is necessary for literary and art workers to eliminate enemies within the ideological scope and study how to use literary and artistic talents to eliminate the remnants of feudal consciousness and the ideological remnants of the reactionary comprador bourgeoisie dependent on imperialism. As the workers' representatives of the arsenal said, this cannot be solved by pistols. More importantly, literary and art workers must extract new Chinese archetypes from the people.
    This conference is now under the shining banner of Mao Zedong, erecting a radiant signpost, which is—go to the ranks of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    The conference calls on literary and art workers to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, not only a combination of life, but also a combination of hearts and souls. Grasping their thoughts and feelings is also grasping the national and historical soul of China today, so as to extract new Chinese archetypes in the struggle against old thoughts and feelings, the beautiful, majestic, and glorious souls belonging to the proletariat.
    I think the main achievement of the conference lies here. Now that this radiant signpost has been erected, it only remains for literary and art workers to take big steps in this direction.
    Gu Yuan
    I participated in this conference and saw the great convergence of the national literary and art army, which was really exciting. After listening to the reports of Vice Chairman Zhou and the leaders, the reports of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the conference, the speeches of the representatives, and the introduction of experience from various regions and departments, I learned many, many things.
    All the representatives enthusiastically supported the new direction of literature and art indicated by Chairman Mao and are willing to make redoubled efforts to realize this direction. I am deeply convinced that before long, the most beautiful flowers of people's literature and art will bloom in all parts of the country.
    In the past, there were not many works by writers and artists that truly reached the masses, and the mass literary and art movement was not very developed.
    I am going back with excitement, working hard to study and work diligently.

    全国文代大会代表对大会感想
    冯雪峰
    我觉得这次大会是很成功的。到会的代表很广泛，却都很热诚。大会开了半个月之久，始终团结在和谐愉快的精神中，一致地研究和学习了毛主席的为人民大众服务的文艺方向。这是有原因的。首先，大会恰好开在人民解放军接连几次的伟大胜利，中国民主革命因此取得了基本成功的时候；其次，中国共产党和毛主席对于文艺工作者又给以特别的关心和爱护，全国人民也予以热烈的鼓励，这些是大会成功的主要原因。全体代表，无论新解放区的或老解放区的，对于毛主席和朱总司令亲临讲话，都感到不能形容的兴奋，认为这是无上的光荣；对于周副主席不辞辛苦的长至六小时的报告，衷心地表示了热诚的感谢，认为这是毛主席文艺方向最正确的解释和具体指示。我相信，经过这次大会之后，新民主主义的新文艺，经由普及和提高的路线，不久就会有巨大的发展。
    张致祥
    这是团结的大会，进步的大会。会后一定可以看到在毛泽东的大旗下，全国文艺界的大进军，人民文艺的辉煌的成就。
    白杨
    这是一次空前的大团结。从陕甘宁老解放区到香港海南，从六七十岁的老前辈到二十来岁的少壮文艺新军，从民间艺人到国际文艺介绍者，各种部门，各种行业，各种形式，都有代表来参加了这一次的盛会，表示了志愿在毛泽东的旗帜下参与文艺建设与国家建设的决心。在这样的一心一德的群众场面里，我只觉得个人是太渺小了，除了把自己的菲薄力量全部贡献出来，不可能再有别的想法了。
    梅兰芳
    这次参加文代大会，我的心情非常愉快而兴奋。
    在会场中所看到的是光明，团结，一片祥和之气，笼罩着整个会场，产生了一种活生生新鲜的力量。我受到了鼓励，我自己感觉到，这短短一个月的学习，把我逝去的青春，找了回来，我不觉年轻了许多。
    许多首长、专家，对于我们所演的戏剧，是这样的重视。对于兰芳个人几十年来在社会上一点微薄的贡献，一再称许，勉励、启发、我更觉得惭愧。
    我今后要根据我这次学习所得，很虚心地，跟着毛主席的思想脚踏实地向前迈进，以达到为人民服务的目的。
    周信芳
    这次来参加空前未有的文代大会，是预备习学为人民服务。聆听各方面关于戏剧的宏论，都说地方戏深入民间，有很多的观众基础。把改革旧剧看成主要任务之一。这使旧剧人感激和自励。虽然这一个月内看的、听的、学了许多，总觉还是不够。我们自然应该努力多多的学习，使旧剧和时代合流。
    巴金
    参加这个大会，我不是来发言的，我是来学习的。而且我参加象这样一个大规模的集会，这还是第一次。在这个大会中我的确得到了不少的东西。
    第一，我看见人怎样把艺术和生活揉在一块儿，把文字和血汗调和在一块儿创造出来一些美丽、健康而且有力量的作品，新中国的灵魂就从它们中间放射出光芒来。
    第二，好些年来我一直是用笔写文章，我常常叹息我的作品软弱无力，我不断地诉苦说，我要放下我的笔。现在我发见确实有不少的人，他们不仅用笔，并且还用行动，用血，用生命完成他们的作品。那些作品鼓舞过无数的人，唤起他们去参加革命的事业，它们还要教育更多的年青的灵魂。
    第三，我感到友爱的温暖。我每次走进会场总有一种回到老家的感觉。在七百多个面孔中至少有一半是我没有见过的，可是它们对我并不是陌生的。我看到的全是诚恳的亲切的脸。我仿佛活在自己的弟兄们中间一样的谈话，讨论，听报告，交换经验，我不感到一点拘束。自由，坦白，没有丝毫的隔阂，好象七百多个人都有着同样的一颗心似的。
    骆宾基
    这次的大会确实是“一个很好的大会”历史上所没有过的大会，由于中国共产党的胜利的照耀而光耀闪闪的大会，“人民所需要的大会”。
    需要文学艺术工作者团结起来，诚垦地研究怎样来为人民服务。需要文学艺术工作者来肃清属于思想范围的敌人，研究怎样用文学艺术才能把封建意识的残余、依存于帝国主义的反动买办资产阶级的思想残余肃清。确如兵工厂的工人代表所说，这是手枪所解决不了的。更重要的还须要文学艺术工作者们从人民中提炼新的中国人的典型。
    这个大会现在是在毛泽东的光辉旗帜的照辉之下，坚起来一个霞光万道的指示牌，那就是——到工农兵的队伍里去。
    大会号召文学艺术工作者去和工农兵结合，不只是生活的结合，需要心魂的结合。把握住他们的思想感情，也就是把握住中国今天的民族和历史的心魂，才能在打击旧的思想感情中，提炼出新的中国人的典型来，属于无产阶级的美的，雄伟的光辉的心魂来。
    我想大会的主要成就在这里。现在这个霞光万道的指示牌是竖立起来了，以后只看文学艺术工作者向这个方向迈大步了。
    古元
    我参加了这次大会，看见了全国文艺大军的大会合，真是兴奋。听了周副主席及各位首长的报告，听了大会正副主席的报告，听了各位代表的发言，听了各地区各部门的经验介绍，我学习到许多许多知识。
    全体代表都热烈拥护了毛主席所指示的文学艺术的新方向，并愿为实现这个方向而加倍努力。我深信，过不了很久，最美丽的人民文艺的花朵，将在全国各个地区上开放着。
    过去，作家们和艺术家们的作品真正到了群众中去的还不多，群众文艺运动开展得还很少。
    我带着兴奋的心情回去，努力学习，勤劳工作。
