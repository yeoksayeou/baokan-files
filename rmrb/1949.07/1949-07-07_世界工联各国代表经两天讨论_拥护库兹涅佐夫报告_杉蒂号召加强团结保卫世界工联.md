Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Milan Dispatch: At the morning session on the fourth day (July 2nd) of the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress, a report was heard from Santi, Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labour. The evening session was dedicated to discussing the reports of Kuznetsov and Santi. The morning and afternoon sessions on the fifth day (July 4th) continued the discussion of the aforementioned two reports, with Kuznetsov summarizing the discussion on his report.

Santi's report had the same subject as Kuznetsov's report. Santi exposed the divisive activities of the right-wing leaders of American and British trade unions, particularly the leaders of the American Federation of Labor. Santi pointed out that one of the aims of their divisive activities was to prevent the working class from uniting around the trade unions as the capitalist economic crisis developed, thereby avoiding the emergence of a broad movement for reforming the economic system.

Santi continued: In this situation, the working class faces the following tasks: to enthusiastically defend the unity of the World Federation of Trade Unions; to explain the harm of division, especially to the workers in those trade unions whose leaders have withdrawn from the World Federation of Trade Unions without their consent; to help develop the trade union movement in colonial countries; to tirelessly fight against infringements on the rights and freedoms of trade unions; and to take joint action with working people belonging to different trade union organizations on a national scale.

In calling on working people to fight against war, Santi said: Preparing for war means an attack on the living standards of working people in capitalist countries, on their democratic rights, and means replacing democracy with death. Therefore, the nature of trade union organizations themselves must be to fight for peace. The outcome of the struggle will be a stronger trade union movement, and this will depend on its unity. Therefore, the unity of trade unions is inextricably linked not only to the struggle of working people for better living standards, but also to the struggle for peace and democracy. If division on a national scale means betraying the struggle for the social and economic interests of the working class, then division on an international scale means betraying the struggle for peace.

Santi concluded by saying: Now is the time to abandon the splitters, the time to appeal directly to those workers who have fallen into the trap of division to return to our big family—the World Federation of Trade Unions.

At the morning and afternoon sessions on the 4th, the reports of Kuznetsov and Santi were discussed. Representatives of the trade union movements of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America fully agreed with the goals and tasks of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the central organizations of the trade unions affiliated to it, as put forward by Kuznetsov.

　　世界工联各国代表经两天讨论
　  拥护库兹涅佐夫报告
    杉蒂号召加强团结保卫世界工联
    【新华社北平六日电】米兰讯：世界工联代表大会第四天（七月二日）上午的会议，听取意大利总工会书记杉蒂的报告，晚间的会议，讨论库兹涅佐夫和杉蒂的报告。第五天（四日）上午与下午的会议，继续讨论上述两个报告，并由库兹涅佐夫关于报告的讨论作出总结。
    杉蒂的报告和库兹涅佐夫的报告同一题目。杉蒂揭露了美英职工会右翼领袖，特别是美国劳联领袖的分裂活动。杉蒂指出，他们分裂活动的一个目的，就是要在资本主义经济危机发展着的时候，使工人阶级不致在职工会的周围团结起来，从而避免一种改革经济制度的广泛运动的产生。
    杉蒂继称：在这种情况下，工人阶级面临着以下的任务，即：热烈地保卫世界工联的团结，解释分裂的害处，特别是向那些未得他们同意，其领袖即退出世界工联的职工会的职工进行解释；帮助发展殖民地国家的职工运动；不倦地为反对侵害职工会的权利和自由而斗争；在全国的规模上与属于不同的职工会机构的劳动人民联合行动。
    在号召劳动人民为反对战争而斗争时，杉蒂说：准备战争意味着对资本主义国家内的劳动人民的生活水平，对他们的民主权利的进攻，意味着以死亡代替民主。因此，职工会组织的性质本身就必须为和平而斗争。斗争的结果将是职工运动的更加强大，而这将决定于它的团结。因此，职工会的团结，不仅是与劳动人民争取更好的生活水平的斗争，并且也与争取和平与民主的斗争，有不可分离的关系。如果说全国规模上的分裂，意味着背叛争取工人阶级社会和经济利益的斗争，那么，国际规模上的分裂，就意味着背叛争取和平的斗争。
    杉蒂在结语中称：现在正是抛弃分裂者的时候了，正是直接向那些堕入分裂陷境里的职工呼吁回到我们的大家庭——世界工联——来的时候了。
    四日上午与下午的会议，讨论库兹涅佐夫与杉蒂的报告。欧洲、亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国职工运动的代表，完全赞同库兹涅佐夫所提出的世界工联与工联所属各国工会中央机构的目标与任务。
