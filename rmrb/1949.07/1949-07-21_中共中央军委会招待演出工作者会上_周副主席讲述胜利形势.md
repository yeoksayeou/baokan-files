　　CCP Central Military Commission Holds Reception for Performing Arts Workers
  　Vice Chairman Zhou Discusses Victorious Situation
    Hopes that Military Art and Literary Workers Will Advance with the Troops
    Minister Lu, Deputy Director Fu, and Others Unanimously Commend Them for Working for the People
    [This newspaper reports] The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission jointly hosted a reception at Zhongnanhai at 1:00 PM on the 19th for various art and literary work groups participating in this Cultural Congress performance. Over 2,000 people from 32 groups, including various field armies, military regions, local art and literary work groups, and the Peking Opera and Quyi circles of Beiping, attended. Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, Minister of Propaganda of the CPC Central Committee Lu Dingyi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Military Commission Fu Zhong, and Chairman and Vice Chairmen of the Cultural Congress Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, and others were present.
    Vice Chairman Zhou emphasized in his speech: With the victorious development of the revolutionary situation, the ranks of art and literary workers must be further expanded in the future. Military art and literary workers must accept more glorious and important tasks, continue to adhere to working with the troops as they advance, and carry out art and literary work wherever the People's Liberation Army fights. Art and literary workers in the rear of the liberated areas should focus on communicating the exchange of urban and rural art and literary work, further delve into the masses, and develop and strengthen their teams to serve the people. Finally, Vice Chairman Zhou encouraged old art and literary workers in Peking Opera, Quyi, and other fields, pointing out that in the past they used feudal and backward things to influence the broad masses, but in today's New Democratic society, old and backward things are bound to decline. The people need new things, so they should strive to transform themselves to serve the people. Only in this way can they have a bright future.
    Comrade Lu Dingyi, Minister of Propaganda of the CPC Central Committee, said: Today, everyone is united under Chairman Mao's direction for art and literature, and we must work harder to develop the popularization of art and literature, while paying attention to improving ourselves ideologically and helping to transform old art and literature, uniting and learning to serve the people.
    Fu Zhong, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Military Commission, emphasized to the staff of military cultural work troupes and drama clubs that they are the concrete executors of Chairman Mao's direction for art and literature. He pointed out that the direction of military art and literary work is mainly popularization and integration with the masses in order to improve. In addition, art and literary work, like combat, requires a combination of courage and skill, that is, a combination of politics and technology, in order to complete the combat tasks of art and literature.
    Guo Moruo said that in the future, art and literary workers across the country should sincerely accept Chairman Mao's artistic and literary principles, and improve artistic and literary work from popularization, from the old liberated areas to the new liberated areas and the areas to be liberated.
    Mao Dun said: After watching the performances of various cultural work troupes and drama clubs, I feel that I have not only seen their brilliant achievements, but also proved that they have correctly implemented Chairman Mao's artistic and literary direction.

　　中共中央军委会招待演出工作者会上
  　周副主席讲述胜利形势
    希望部队文艺工作者跟部队向前进
    陆部长傅副主任等一致嘉勉为人民工作
    【本报讯】中国共产党中央委员会及中国人民革命军事委员会于十九日下午一时在中南海联合招待参加此次文代大会演出的各个文艺工作团体。出席有各野战军、军区、地方文艺工作团队，及北平平剧、曲艺界等共三十二个团体二千余人。周恩来副主席、中共中央宣传部长陆定一、军委政治部副主任傅钟及文代会正副主席郭沫若、茅盾、周扬等均出席。
    周副主席的讲话中强调指出：跟着革命形势的胜利发展今后文艺工作者的阵营要更加扩大。部队文艺工作者要接受更光荣重大的任务，继续坚持跟着部队前进工作，人民解放军打到哪里，文艺工作作到哪里。解放区后方的文艺工作者要着重沟通城乡文艺工作的交流，更加深入群众和发展壮大自己的队伍，为人民服务。最后周副主席勉励平剧、曲艺界等旧文艺工作者，指出他们过去是拿封建落后的东西影响了广大的群众的，但在今天新民主主义的社会下旧的落后的东西必然要趋于没落，人民需要新的东西，所以他们应当努力改造自己，以为人民服务，只有这样才能有远大的前途。
    中共中央宣传部长陆定一同志说：今天大家都一致团结在毛主席的文艺方向下，对文艺的普及工作要更加努力发展，同时注意在思想上提高自己，并帮助改造旧文艺，团结学习为人民服务。
    军委政治部副主任傅钟着重对部队文工团、剧社的工作人员讲：他们是毛主席文艺方向的具体执行者。并指出部队文艺工作的方向，主要是普及、与群众结合一起才能提高，此外文艺工作要同作战一样，需要勇敢与技术结合，即是政治与技术结合，这样才能完成文艺的战斗任务。
    郭沫若说，今后全国的文艺工作者应诚心诚意的接受毛主席的文艺方针，把文艺工作从普及中提高，从老解放区普及到新解放区、待解放区。
    茅盾说：看过了各文工团、剧社的演出，觉得不仅看到了他们辉煌的成绩，而且证明了他们是正确的执行了毛主席的文艺方向。
