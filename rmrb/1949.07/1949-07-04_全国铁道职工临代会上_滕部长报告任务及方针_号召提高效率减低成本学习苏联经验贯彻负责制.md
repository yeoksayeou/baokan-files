The National Railway Workers' Provisional Congress

　　Minister Teng Reports on Tasks and Policies

　　Calls for Improving Efficiency, Reducing Costs, Learning from Soviet Experience, and Implementing the Responsibility System

　　[Ping Municipal Dispatch] At the second day of the National Railway Workers' Provisional Representative Congress, Minister Teng made a report on the current tasks and policies for railway workers. Minister Teng first gave a profound analysis of the current victorious situation of the national revolution. He pointed out that the Kuomintang's reactionary rule had severely devastated China's industry. If we want to make China economically completely independent, we must not only strive to restore the damaged industry within three to five years, but also achieve a considerable and strong development in several years. Only in this way can we achieve economic independence and establish a solid national defense to protect our motherland's sacred and inviolable borders. Only when industry develops can it be possible to gradually improve the living standards of the working class and the people, consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants, truly exert the role of cities leading the countryside, and lay a solid economic foundation for the future transition to socialism. He pointed out: Only when industrial and agricultural products are developed in large quantities can the degree of national prosperity be explained. Only low-cost goods can expand market capacity. Therefore, railways play a leading and disseminating role in the large-scale exchange of industrial and agricultural products, increasing the turnover rate of industrial raw materials and finished products, and reducing production costs. Therefore, railways must first regard reducing railway transportation costs as a very important factor in the construction of the new China. Therefore, railway workers must take improving efficiency and reducing costs as their goals. The new type of railway that the Chinese people need is none other than a railway network with high efficiency and low cost. At present, in order to achieve national victory, support the People's Liberation War, and quickly, decisively, thoroughly, and completely eliminate all remaining reactionaries, we must achieve "where the army fights, the railway is built."

　　The second part of Minister Teng's report was on how to rely on the working class, unite all railway employees willing to serve the people, restore and build the people's railway network, and fight for the final elimination of the remaining reactionary forces and the acceleration of China's industrialization. He said: The creativity of the industrious Chinese railway workers has long been stifled by imperialism and reactionaries, making them backward and conservative, and trapped in disaster for a long time. Minister Teng used the examples of the revived "Mao Zedong" locomotive, No. 884, and "May 1st Labor" locomotive, and the high labor enthusiasm and creativity of railway workers after liberation, to make a clear contrast with the past. In particular, this year in May, the task of transporting 378 military trains, totaling 756 million ton-kilometers, was completed ten days ahead of schedule, ensuring that 2 million troops crossed the Yangtze River to the south, accelerating the victory of the liberation war. Minister Teng continued to point out: The achievement of these results is due to the railway workers' selfless work, which is inseparable from the development of the liberation war and the active assistance of the peasants. In particular, the advanced experience of socialist Soviet Union was accepted, and the responsibility system with the workers as the masters was implemented. The locomotive section implemented the package ride system, the fixed inspection system by kilometer, and the warm water washing tank system. A new train operation method was implemented, and the organization of clear division of labor and joint labor began. The responsibility system was gradually extended to transportation, engineering, and telecommunications. This system can only be implemented in the Soviet Union and new democratic countries. It has opened up the possibility of active creation and competition for the vast number of employees. Minister Teng also proposed to use the three heroic locomotives of "Mao Zedong," "Iron Bull," and No. 884 as the national flags, and suggested launching a widespread movement of Li Yong, the labor hero's locomotive, which was warmly approved by all the representatives.

　　全国铁道职工临代会上
  　滕部长报告任务及方针
    号召提高效率减低成本学习苏联经验贯彻负责制
    【平市讯】全国铁道职工临时代表议会第二日，由滕部长作关于铁路职工当前任务与方针的报告。滕部长首先对目前全国革命的胜利形势作了深刻的分析，他指出国民党的反动统治使得中国工业受到严重的摧残，我们要使中国达到经济上完全独立，则不独努力争取被破坏的工业能在三、五年内恢复，而且要在若干年内必须做到有相当强大的发展，如此经济上才能得到独立，才能建立起巩固的国防，以保卫我们祖国神圣不可侵犯的边疆。只有工业发展起来，才有可能逐渐提高工人阶级自己和人民的生活水平，才能巩固工农间的联盟，真正发挥城市领导乡村的作用，才能替将来转向社会主义打下了强固的经济基础。他指出：只有工业农业品大量发展的时候，才能说明国家富裕的程度，只有成本低廉的物品，才能扩大市场的容量，所以关于工业品农业品大量交换提高工业原料和成品周转速度，降低生产品成本费，铁路担任着领头和传播的作用，因此铁路首先把减低铁路运输成本费当作自己对新中国建设一个十分重大的因素。因此铁路职工必须把提高效率，减低成本作为自己奋斗的目标，中国人民所需要的新型铁路不是别的，正是效率很高成本很低的铁路网。在目前为了取得全国胜利，支援人民解放战争，迅速干脆彻底全部最后消灭一切残余反动派，我们就必须做到“军队打到那里，铁路修到那里。”
    滕部长报告的第二部分是如何依靠工人阶级，团结一切愿为人民服务的铁路从业员，恢复与建设人民的铁道网，为最后消灭反动派残余力量，加速中国工业化而斗争，他说：勤劳的中国铁路职工的创造性，曾长期为帝国主义、反动派所窒息，使他们落后与保守，长期陷于灾难中。滕部长用死车复活的毛泽东号、八八四号、“五一”劳动号的例子与解放后铁路职工高度的劳动热情与创造性与过去作了鲜明的对比。特别是今年五月提前十天完成三百七十八列车的军运七万万五千六百万吨公里任务，保证二百万大军渡江南下，加速了解放战争的胜利。滕部长继续指出：取得这些成绩是由于铁路职工奋不顾身的工作，这与解放战争的发展农民的积极帮助是分不开的，特别是接受社会主义苏联的先进经验，推行了以职工作主人的负责制，机务方面的包乘制，按公里定检制，温水洗罐制度施行了新行车法，开始了明确分工与联合劳动的组织，负责制逐渐推广到运务、工务、电务等方面，这种制度只有在苏联和新民主主义国家才有可能实行，他给广大职工开辟了积极创造竞赛的可能条件。滕部长并提出以毛泽东号、铁牛号、八八四号三个英雄机车作为全国的旗帜，并建议开展李永劳动英雄的机车的广泛的运动，得到全体代表的热烈赞同。
