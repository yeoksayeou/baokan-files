    Visiting the Writer Wang Tongzhao
    Bai Sheng
    Recently, this reporter visited the veteran writer Wang Tongzhao, who came from Qingdao to Beijing to attend the Literary and Art Congress.
    Mr. Wang was one of the initiators of the Literary Research Association during the May Fourth Movement, along with Mao Dun, Zheng Zhenduo, and others. He wrote many novels and poems and taught at Shandong University in Qingdao and Jinan University in Shanghai. Mr. Wang had a vast collection of books before the War of Resistance, but they were all destroyed by the Japanese invaders, which is something he still feels deeply saddened and resentful about to this day.
    During the War of Resistance, he and Zheng Zhenduo and others lived in seclusion in Shanghai, enduring a difficult life. They were not only spiritually unfree but also subjected to economic pressure. He often could only drink a bowl of thin porridge or buy one or two baked buns on the street to satisfy his hunger.
    His earliest novels, such as "A Leaf," and later works like "Mountain Rain," all reflected the reality of society at the time. "Mountain Rain" is a full-length novel of two hundred thousand words with the rural areas before and after the September 18th Incident as its theme. At the time, this novel was banned from publication by the Kuomintang under the charge of promoting class struggle. Later, he wrote "Spring Bloom," which tells the story of students' revolution after the May Fourth Movement. Mr. Wang said that he is now preparing to write the sequel to "Spring Bloom," titled "Autumn Harvest."
    Speaking of the literary and artistic works of the Liberated Areas, he believes that these works are so real. For example, the works that describe peasants, their language and scenes, are very intimate and thorough to read. Mr. Wang highly praises Zhao Shuli's works, such as "The Ballads of Li Youcai." He said that from this work, he not only saw the author's sincere writing attitude, but also the author's personality was developed in the article, written genuinely and with flavor.
    Mr. Wang believes that the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao to literary and art workers is very important. Literary and art workers can only find a way out by serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Chairman Mao's literary and art direction pointed out the fallacy of literature that was used for the entertainment of the bourgeoisie in the past. Literary and artistic work should move forward on a broad and universal road, which is an epoch-making and important proposition.
    Mr. Wang said that this Literary and Art Congress is where everyone gathered together from all directions under this direction. It can be said to be a grand gathering unprecedented in history. If there were no directional guidance from Chairman Mao, no leadership from Marxism-Leninism, and no people's struggle for liberation, how could there be this unprecedented congress! All this demonstrates the greatness of the people's power now.

    访作家王统照
    柏生
    最近记者走访了由青岛来平参加文代大会的老作家王统照。
    王先生是“五四”时代与茅盾、郑振铎等同为文学研究会发起人之一。他写了许多小说和诗，曾在青岛山东大学及上海暨南大学执教。王先生在抗战前藏书极多，但后来均被日寇所毁，这是他至今谈起来还觉得最伤心痛恨的一件事。
    抗战期间，他和郑振铎等诸位潜居上海，过着艰苦的生活，不但精神上不自由，就是生活上也受着压迫，他常常只能喝一碗稀粥或到街上买一两个烧饼充饥。
    他写的小说最早的如“一叶”，其后如“山雨”等都是反映了当时社会的现实的。“山雨”是以九一八事变前后的农村为主题，一部二十万字的长篇小说。这部小说当时曾被国民党以提倡阶级斗争的罪名禁止出版。以后他又写了“春华”，写的是“五四”运动以后学生的革命故事。王先生说他现在又正在准备写“春华”的后部，题名叫作“秋实”。
    谈到解放区的文艺作品，他认为这些作品都是那么真实，如写农民的作品，语言、情景，读起来就非常亲切透澈。对于赵树理的作品，如“李有才板话”等，王先生极为推崇。他说从这个作品中不但看出了作者的写作态度的诚恳，并且在文章中发挥了作者的个性，写的真切而饶风味。
    王先生认为毛主席给文艺工作者指出的方向非常重要。文艺工作者只有为工农兵服务才有出路。毛主席的文艺方向，指明了过去为资产阶级作消遣的文学的谬误，文艺工作应向广大、普遍的大道上迈步前进，实是划时代的重要主张。
    王先生说，这次的文代大会就是在这个方向下，大家从四面八方会聚起来的，这可以说是历史上从来未有的一次盛大聚会，假若没有毛主席的指示方向，没有马列主义做领导，没有人民谋求解放的斗争，怎么能有这次空前的大会！这一切都表现了现在人民力量的伟大。
