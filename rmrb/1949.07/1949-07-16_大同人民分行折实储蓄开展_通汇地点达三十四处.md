    Datong People's Branch Launches Standard Unit Savings; Exchange Locations Reach Thirty-Four
    [Datong News] Since the Datong City People's Branch began offering standard unit savings deposits, the number of depositors has steadily increased due to various promotional activities. In the twenty-odd days up to the 9th, the number of depositors reached sixty-five households, depositing a total of 2,870 standard units of real goods, equivalent to 610,379.8 yuan in People's Currency; currency deposits amounted to 52,900 yuan, of which workers accounted for forty-six households. However, due to some workers' insufficient understanding of the deposit regulations, deposits are not yet widespread. The bank has decided to send personnel to factories and schools to provide explanations and actively liaise with trade unions and people's organizations.

    Furthermore, in order to facilitate the flow of goods and promote trade, the bank is actively engaged in remittance services. New remittance locations include Beiping, Tangshan, Yuci, and Zhangbei. Including previously established locations, the total number is thirty-four. From June 20th to the end of the month, a total of thirty-four remittances were received, amounting to 5,532,000 yuan in People's Currency, and thirty-two remittances were sent out, totaling 33,133,100 yuan. Preparations are now underway to establish remittance relations with Xiheying, Qinhuangdao, Zhaocheng, Dingxing, Yixian, Dezhou, Cangxian, Wu'an, Xingtai, and Hejian, and telegraphic transfers to Taiyuan are also being actively prepared.

    大同人民分行折实储蓄开展
    通汇地点达三十四处
    【大同讯】大同市人民分行办理折实储蓄存款以来，经过了各种宣传活动，存户不断增加。截至九号的二十多天中，存户已达六十五户，共存入标准实物单位二千八百七十个，合人民券六十一万零三百七十九元八角；存入货币五万二千九百元，其中工人即占四十六户，但目前因有的工人，对存款章则了解还不够，致存款的还不普遍；银行决定在今后派人亲往各工厂学校进行解说工作，主动与工会及各人民团体联系。
    又该行为畅通物资交流，便利贸易，积极举办汇兑业务。新通汇地点已有北平、唐山、榆次、张北等。连前已通汇者共计三十四处。自六月二十日至月终，共计汇入三十四宗，人民币五百五十三万二千元，汇出三十二宗三千三百一十三万三千一百元。现已准备与西合营、秦皇岛、赵城、定兴、易县、德州、沧县、武安、邢台、河间打通汇兑关系，和太原的电汇也在积极准备办理中。
