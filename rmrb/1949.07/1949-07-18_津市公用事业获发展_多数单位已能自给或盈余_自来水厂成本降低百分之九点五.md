Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 17th. Tianjin's public utilities have seen considerable development in the past six months, and most units have now achieved profitability or are breaking even. Workers at the publicly owned Tianjin Waterworks and the privately owned Ji'an Waterworks have been actively repairing and replacing water pipes for several months, reducing water consumption, and paying attention to conservation, resulting in a 9.5 percent reduction in costs. After the Tianjin Branch of the North China Electric Power Company added generating equipment, the power generation increased from over 20,000 kilowatts to over 33,000 kilowatts, and the city's electricity needs can now be met independently. The number of city transportation vehicles has also been increasing monthly. In June, the average daily number of streetcars in operation was 132, exceeding the record during the Kuomintang's management. The number of buses in operation daily was 40, also reaching 80 percent of the highest record before liberation. The city's telephone system, which was severely damaged during the Tianjin liberation campaign, had restored over 15,000 households by the end of June; long-distance wired and wireless telephone services to seventeen routes, including Ping (Beijing), Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Qingdao, have been gradually opened, and wireless telegraph services have been opened to twenty routes. Postal services have also seen significant development with the development of the military victory situation. According to preliminary statistics for June, the telecommunications bureau had a surplus of over 100 million yuan, and the city waterworks made a profit of over 2 million yuan, only accounting for 5 percent. Other businesses such as streetcars and electricity also had surpluses or broke even. Only buses were operating at a loss due to the high price of gasoline and high costs; it is expected that the loss-making situation can be gradually improved after all lines are converted to charcoal-fueled vehicles by the end of July.

The high enthusiasm for production among workers after liberation and the preliminary implementation of democratic enterprise management and enterprise-oriented operation are the main reasons for achieving the above results. At the beginning of Tianjin's liberation, temporary employee representative conferences were generally established in various units to assist in the takeover, inventory, and employee education. At the end of March, some units established employee representative conferences and employee union preparatory committees to further strengthen employee organization, propaganda and education, welfare, and other work, and most units established employee consumer cooperatives. At the same time, factory management committees were formed in various factories, and the monthly production plans were submitted to the employees of each department for discussion. These measures strengthened the workers' sense of responsibility and initiative. Many workers have made inventions in production, ensuring the completion of production plans. In addition, all units have completed the clearing, auditing, and valuation of all assets, and have begun to pilot the cost accounting system since July. Individual units have also recently completed the streamlining of institutions. These measures have enabled the above-mentioned units to take a step forward in enterprise-oriented management.

    津市公用事业获发展
    多数单位已能自给或盈余
    自来水厂成本降低百分之九点五
    【新华社天津十七日电】津市公用事业半年来有相当发展，大多单位现已达到盈余或收支平衡。公营市自来水厂及私营济安自来水厂职工，数月来积极检修和换装水管，减少耗水量，注意节约，使成本降低了百分之九点五。华北电业天津分公司增设发电设备后，发电量由二万余千瓦增至三万三千余千瓦，全市需用电力已可自给。市内交通车辆亦逐月增多，六月份电车每日出车数平均为一百三十二辆，超过国民党经营时的纪录。公共汽车每日出车四十辆，亦达到解放前最高纪录的百分之八十。市内电话在解放天津战役中曾受严重损坏，到六月底已恢复一万五千余户；对外长途有线与无线电话，已陆续开放平沪宁汉青等十七路，无线电报开放二十路。邮政业务随着军事胜利形势的发展亦有很大开展。上述各企业的营业情况，据六月份初步统计，电信局盈余一亿元以上，市自来水厂获利两百余万，仅占百分之五。其他如电车、电业等也有盈余或收支平衡。只有公共汽车一项因汽油价贵，成本过高而入不敷出；预计在七月底全线改为木炭车后，亏蚀情况当可逐步改善。
    各单位职工解放后生产热情的高涨与企业管理民主化、经营企业化的初步实施，是获得上述成绩的主要原因。天津解放之初，各单位普遍成立了临时职工代表会，协助进行接管、清点及办理职工教育等工作。三月底有些单位又成立了职工代表会及职工会筹委员，进一步加强职工组织、宣教、福利等工作，大多数单位并建立了职工消费合作社。同时各厂组成工厂管理委员会，每月的生产计划，均交各部门职工讨论。这些措施加强了职工的责任心与积极性，不少职工在生产中有创造发明，使生产计划的完成有了保证。另外，各单位已完成了全部财产的清审与估价工作，自七月份起已开始试行成本会计制度。个别单位并在最近完成了精简机构的工作。这些措施使上述单位在企业化经营上前进了一步。
