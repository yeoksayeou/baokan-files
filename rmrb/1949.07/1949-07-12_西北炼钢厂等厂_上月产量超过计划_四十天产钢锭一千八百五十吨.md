Taiyuan Dispatch: The Northwest Steel Plant, Yucai Steel Machinery Plant, Kiln Factory and other factories in Taiyuan achieved significant results in production in June. The steel plant originally planned to produce 6,900 tons of coke from May 10th to June 30th, but exceeded the plan by 420 tons; gasoline was originally planned to produce 9 tons, but exceeded the plan by one-third; pig iron was originally planned to produce 1,750 tons, but the actual output exceeded the plan by 835 tons; calcium carbide was originally planned to produce 10 tons, but the actual output was 15.4 tons; steel ingots were originally planned to be produced from May 20th to June 30th at 1,500 tons, but in addition to completing the plan, an additional 350 tons were produced. Only asphalt failed to meet the plan due to the explosion of the coal tar heat exchanger (originally planned to produce 45 tons, actual output was 39 tons). The Yucai Factory's iron ball product in June exceeded the original plan by 3 tons, fishplate bolts were originally planned to be manufactured at 1,200, but the actual output was 1,400, and various steels were originally planned to produce 31.5 tons, but the actual output was 71 tons. The Kiln Factory also largely completed its production tasks in June: such as producing 84 tons of sand bricks, exceeding the original plan by 4 tons; producing 166 tons of crucible mortar, exceeding the original plan by 66 tons; producing 532 tons of sand powder, exceeding the original plan by 118 tons; making 3,500 square feet of glass, exceeding the original plan by 700 square feet. The actual output of other items such as ceramic ware also exceeded the original plan by about 40%. Workers in various factories not only completed their production tasks, but also worked hard to improve their technology: for example, Zhao Fu, the foreman of the Kiln Factory, painstakingly researched and modified the press day and night, and finally succeeded in the experiment, which doubled the original efficiency (pressing 500 sulfuric acid boxes per day). Before liberation, the Yucai Factory used 1,800 kilowatts of electricity to refine a furnace of steel, but now the workers pay attention to saving, and each furnace of steel only uses 1,400 kilowatts of electricity.

　　西北炼钢厂等厂
  　上月产量超过计划
    四十天产钢锭一千八百五十吨
    【太原电】太原西北炼钢厂、育才炼钢机械厂、窑厂等厂生产，六月份获得显著成绩。炼钢厂从五月十日至六月三十日，原计划生产焦炭六千九百吨，结果超过计划四百二十吨；汽油原计划产九吨，结果超过计划三分之一；生铁原计划生产一千七百五十吨，实际产额超过计划八百三十五吨；电石原计划产十吨，实际产品十五点四吨；钢锭原计划从五月二十日至六月三十日生产一千五百吨，结果除完成计划外，并增产三百五十吨。只有沥青因煤焦油热交换器爆炸未能按计划完成（原计划生产四十五吨，实产三十九吨）。育才厂六月份铁球产品超过原计划三吨，鱼尾螺丝原计划制造一千二百个，实际出产一千四百个，各种钢原计划生产三十一吨半，实际生产七十一吨。窑厂六月份的生产任务，亦大部完成：如产砂砖八十四吨，超过原计划四吨。产坩砂浆一百六十六吨，超过原计划六十六吨。生产砂粉五百三十二吨，超过原计划一百一十八吨。制玻璃三千五百平方尺，超出原计划七百平方尺。其他如陶瓷器皿等实际产额均超过原计划百分之四十左右。各厂工人不仅完成生产任务，而且在努力提高技术：如窑厂工长赵富等昼夜苦心研究改装压榨机，最后试验成功，较原来效能（每日压硫酸盒五百个）增产一倍。育才厂解放前炼一炉钢用电一千八百千瓦，现在工人们注意节约，每炉钢只用电一千四百千瓦。
