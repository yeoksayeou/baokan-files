Over a hundred representatives from the National Railway Locomotive Conference also attended as observers.

    First, Comrade Li Jiebo, Director of the ACFTU Railway Work Committee, announced the opening of the meeting, reporting on the process of convening the meeting and its significance. He said: "Chinese railway workers have a glorious history of struggle. As early as 1924, the All-China Railway General Trade Union was organized. Therefore, the ACFTU agreed to the proposal of the Northeast Railway General Trade Union and decided to restore the All-China Railway General Trade Union. The tasks of this meeting are: 1. To discuss the principles and tasks of the people's railway; 2. To discuss the railway responsibility system; 3. To discuss the democratization of railway factory management; 4. To draft the constitution of the All-China Railway General Trade Union; 5. To elect the preparatory committee of the All-China Railway General Trade Union."

    Commander-in-Chief Zhu delivered a speech, emphasizing that the revolution is approaching the final victory nationwide. Under this victorious situation, the greatest task of the railway working class is: "To rapidly restore national railway transportation, support the People's Liberation War, and strive for the final victory of the whole country!" Chairman Dong Biwu spoke, instructing the workers to study three major things at present: First, to learn management, production technology, and administrative work; second, to learn the ability to manage the country; and third, to learn from the advanced Soviet experience in railway management. Comrade Lin Boqu said: "China is transforming from an agricultural country to an industrial country, from a backward country to an advanced country. This great and glorious task requires our working class to undertake and complete it." Mayor Ye Jianying emphasized: "Developing production depends on transportation, first and foremost railway transportation. China's railway construction plays a significant role in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, as well as domestically and internationally, and in promoting economic prosperity." Comrade Bo Yibo said: "Thanks to the heroic repair work of the railway working class, nearly 16,000 kilometers have now been opened to traffic, powerfully supporting the People's Liberation War." He emphatically stated: "We must serve the people wholeheartedly and rely on the working class wholeheartedly. Our working class has the talent and wisdom to create the world, and we must greatly unleash the unity and creativity of the working class!" Vice-Chairman of the ACFTU Li Lisan gave a detailed account of the glorious revolutionary history of the Chinese working class. He said: "The Chinese railway working class has always stood at the forefront and played a leading role in past revolutionary movements. The 'February 7th' railway workers' strike and demonstration is a concrete manifestation of this." Finally, he called out: "There is no other way to improve the lives of our working class except to develop the national industry, increase production more, support the Liberation War, achieve the final victory of the whole country, improve the lives of the people across the country, and only then can the lives of the workers be improved and the working class achieve complete victory." Comrade Feng Wenbin called on all the attending workers and members of the Communist Youth League, saying: "We must organize young workers from all over the country and develop them into members of the Communist Youth League. In one or two years, there will be more 'Youth' locomotives." Subsequently, worker representatives spoke. Zhang Zhongye, driver of the Northeast 884 locomotive, said: "I started working as a railway worker at the age of sixteen. I am twenty-five years old this year. If it were not for the Communist Party, I would be oppressed forever and be a blacksmith for the rest of my life. Now I have been promoted to driver. Today, I am very excited and honored to participate in this meeting. This is the liberation of the workers!" Li Yonggeng, an underground representative from Shanghai, reported on the struggle of workers against the Kuomintang reactionaries before and after the liberation of Shanghai. Wu Zhongyi, driver of the Northeast Youth No. 200 locomotive, said: "I am very happy to participate in this meeting. I will definitely bring the spirit and resolutions of the meeting back and implement them in my work." Pan Shi'an, a representative from Hankou, is a worker who participated in the "February 7th" strike. He recounted the history of the workers' heroic struggle against the reactionary forces based on his personal experience. Hu Tianmin, a representative from Hangzhou, Li Zhengang, a representative from Peiping-Tianjin, and representatives attending the National Locomotive Conference, Su Yinsheng, driver of the "May 1st Labor" locomotive from Fengtai, and Wang Yanqing, driver of the "Youth" locomotive from Dunhua, spoke successively. Finally, the conference passed three telegrams: 1. A salute to Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee; 2. A salute to Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army; 3. Congratulations on the opening of the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
