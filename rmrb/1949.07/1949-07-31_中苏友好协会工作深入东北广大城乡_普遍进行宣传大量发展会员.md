　　Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's Work Deepens in Northeast's Vast Urban and Rural Areas
  　Extensive Propaganda and Large-Scale Membership Development

[By Our Correspondent] Northeast News: Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various parts of Northeast China are actively developing their work in order to establish and develop friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, promote cultural and economic ties and cooperation in various fields, and strive for lasting world peace. The Qiqihar Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, based on the half-year plan of the Heilongjiang Provincial Friendship Association, has formulated a half-year work plan for the Qiqihar City Friendship Association: propaganda activities will be widely carried out to promote the spirit of internationalism and the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship in factories, schools, government agencies, and organizations; it is also expected that membership will reach about 10,000 by the end of the year, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Cultural Club and reading room in the city, as well as the Russian night school, will be established. Since the Harbin City Friendship Association publicly called for large-scale development of new members on July 11, more than 160 units have picked up membership application forms, and more than 16,500 people have applied for membership. For example, more than 120 of the 400 employees of the Harbin Electric Machinery Iron Factory automatically signed up at the beginning. After the Friendship Association sent someone to give a report, the enthusiasm of the employees was greatly increased, and they automatically requested the establishment of a branch preparatory committee. The Harbin City Friendship Association will also gradually carry out its propaganda and publishing work. The Changchun Friendship Association also passed the half-year work plan of the Changchun City Friendship Association on July 16. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in Mudanjiang, Jiamusi and other places were established one after another from last month to the beginning of this month and began their work. Since the preparatory committee of the Shenyang City Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established on June 11, it has established 20 branches in factories, schools, and government agencies, with more than 5,490 members. The Jilin City Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established in May, and the Russian night school sponsored by the association has also begun enrolling students.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in Northeast China, with those in Harbin and the Lushun-Dalian area having the longest history, have achieved great results. The Harbin City Friendship Association was established in October 1945, and its first president was General Li Zhaolin, who was murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents after 14 years of resistance against Japan. In the past four years, the association has held five large-scale and more than 140 small-scale Soviet photo exhibitions and lectures to introduce the Soviet Union's five-year plan and the restoration and development of socialist economic construction before and after the anti-fascist war. The "Introduction to the Soviet Union" (monthly magazine), which was published in 1947, has been published to the twenty-fifth issue, with subscribers all over the country. Soviet students in the Chinese class can speak Chinese, and Chinese students in the Russian class can generally read Russian newspapers. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in the Lushun-Dalian area has been developing continuously for four years and has become a large-scale mass organization. The association has established 763 branches in factories, enterprises, and rural areas, with more than 202,200 members. The Friendship Bookstore under the association has published nearly 600,000 copies of books introducing the Soviet Union, as well as 89 kinds of magazines such as "Sino-Soviet Knowledge," "Friendship Books and Newspapers," and "Friendship Bi-Monthly." The understanding and friendship between the people of the Lushun-Dalian area and the Soviet expatriates have been increasingly enhanced by these activities of the association.

    【本报讯】东北消息：东北各地中苏友好协会，为建立与发展中苏两国人民的友谊与文化经济和各方面的联系，及争取世界永久和平，纷纷展开工作。齐齐哈尔中苏友好协会，根据黑龙江省友协的半年计划，制定了齐市友协的半年工作计划：宣传活动将普遍展开，在工厂、学校、机关、团体中宣传国际主义的精神和中苏友好的重大意义；并预计到年底发展到一万左右会员，市内中苏友好文化俱乐部与阅览室，及俄语夜校均将建立。哈尔滨市友协，自七月十一日公开号召大量发展新会员后，已有一百六十余处取去入会志愿书，而要求入会者已有一万六千五百多人，如该市电汽机械铁工厂四百余职工，一开始就有一百二十多人自动报名，经友协派人前去作过一次报告后，职工热情高涨，更自动要求成立支会筹备会。哈市友协关于宣传、出版工作，亦将次第展开。长春友协也于七月十六日通过了长市友协的半年工作计划。牡丹江、佳木斯等地中苏友好协会，自上月至本月初，均先后成立并展开工作，沈阳市中苏友好协会筹备会于六月十一日成立后，迄今已在工厂、学校、机关中建立了二十个支会，会员已有五千四百九十余人。吉林市中苏友好协会于五月即行成立，该会主办之俄文夜校也开始招生。
