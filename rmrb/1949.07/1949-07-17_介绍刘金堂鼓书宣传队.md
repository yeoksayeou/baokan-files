    Introducing Liu Jintang's Drum Ballad Propaganda Team
    Hua Fei

    Liu Jintang's drum ballad propaganda team is quite famous in the Taiyue District. They have made significant achievements in serving farmers and soldiers, and he has played a leading role in reforming old folk artists. They have become a powerful cultural force in cultural and educational work for publicizing and educating farmers.

    Liu Jintang is from Yangcheng, Taiyue District, Shanxi Province. When he was a child, he was captured by the Kuomintang reactionary army and forced to be a year-round errand boy. Those reactionary officers often forced him to steal farmers' turnips and vegetables, bullying the farmers. Because he was a farmer's son, he found these bad deeds unbearable, so he ran away from home and learned storytelling. At that time (before the War of Resistance, before liberation), the stories told were all feudal superstitions. Families would hire them to tell stories for ancestor worship, fulfilling vows, or celebrating a child's full month. After his home was liberated in 1941, the peasants turned over, and everything was being reformed. Farmers began to dislike the old feudal drum ballads, and his drum ballads could no longer survive if he remained old-fashioned. In the tide of earth-shaking social changes, Liu Jintang first compiled his story of being forced to steal turnips and vegetables as an errand boy in Chiang Kai-shek's army into a new drum ballad to expose the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's army. At the same time, he contrasted this with how good things were after the People's Liberation Army came! After this passage was told, the masses welcomed it, further encouraging his confidence in adapting new books. With the leadership and support of the Anti-Japanese Democratic Government, he began to transform from feudal books to a new drum ballad team serving the people.

    After that, the county government used him as a model, praised him, and promoted his experience to educate and transform more than 100 old storytellers, both professional and semi-professional, in the county, so that they could all serve the people under the leadership of the Anti-Japanese Democratic Government. Their method was to first organize Liu Jintang's drum ballad propaganda team to go to various parts of the county to tell new stories, publicize the benefits of the new stories, and inspire old folk artists to be willing to transform their thinking. Then, they gathered some activists to hold meetings and training, using Liu Jintang's own personal experience to explain that old books must be transformed and can be transformed well. They also explained that in the old society, when telling old stories, people didn't treat us like human beings; in the new society, when telling new stories, the people treat us like teachers. Telling new stories is glorious, and telling old stories has no future. From then on, everyone scrambled to learn new stories. They could all combine with the central work in the countryside to carry out drum ballad propaganda, and the government organized and planned this force. Whenever a central task was deployed, such as production, army expansion, agricultural loans, war preparations, etc., the Civil Education Section would have Liu Jintang compose drum ballads to coordinate the mobilization of the masses to implement this work. Because Liu Jintang himself is a farmer, he understands the ideological situation of farmers in various tasks, so he can vividly and graphically compile a principle issue into a drum ballad, so that people hear something with substance instead of dry clauses. After the composition is finished and revised, the heads of each drum ballad group are gathered to learn, and after learning, it is widely spread. The following is the drum ballad he composed about "Attending Winter School":

    Sisters and brothers, fellow compatriots, listen to me tell you about winter school.
    The Anti-Japanese Government has called for the establishment of winter schools in various villages.
    Regardless of old or young, regardless of men or women, everyone goes to school.
    It's really bad not to know how to read, and you suffer losses everywhere.
    You can be forced to pay back more than you owe, and you forget how much others owe you.
    You can't use an abacus, and you can't write with a pen.
    You don't know which way is up when reading a book, you only see black marks on white paper.
    Now, when spending money, you can't recognize how many yuan and jiao there are.
    When you go to the street to buy things, you take a railway ticket as Jicha (currency issued by the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe Border Region).
    (At that time, the railway bank notes issued in Shanxi)
    In the past, although there were schools, poor people didn't have money, and people weren't taught.
    The Communist Party has come, and the dark society has been overthrown.
    Winter schools are set up in every village, and everyone quickly runs to school.
    In school, it's really good, and you can learn many skills.
    Learn to read, learn to write, learn to keep accounts and write notes.
    The workers and peasants hold power today, and these skills are very important.
    If you learn to use an abacus, you will be numerate and you can calculate the profits and losses.
    If you can read more, you can read the newspaper, and you will know about international events.
    Learning culture is for your own use, and robbers can't steal it away.
    Now that Japan has surrendered, winter school must be done well.
    But some folks still don't understand winter school well.
    Some people go to school just to register, and some people just come to join in the fun.
    The teacher patiently keeps explaining, but he is dozing off below.
    Some people take the opportunity to make noise and say that he is half-baked.
    Everyone must change their old habits and improve their learning spirit.
    Come a little later, arrive a little earlier, don't learn from lazy people.
    Even if there is something urgent, you should ask for leave yourself.
    Cadres should be role models, and students should challenge each other.
    Everyone should strive to be a role model, and a typical winter school is inevitable.
    ………………………………

    This passage of his book not only pointed out the harm of illiteracy and the benefits of attending winter school, but also criticized some incorrect attitudes towards attending winter school, and proposed what correct attitude should be adopted. Therefore, this passage of the book played a great role in mobilizing people to attend winter school.

    Liu Jintang's drum ballad propaganda team not only serves farmers well, but also has made significant achievements in serving soldiers. After the Yuncheng Campaign in 1947, they went to the troops to perform drum ballads to comfort the troops, telling the heroic stories and model battles of whichever regiment they went to... They collected materials and composed on the same day, and performed as soon as they were composed. He could even perform immediately after hearing the materials. This kind of storytelling of real people and real events greatly encouraged the troops, and the troops welcomed it very much. Their eight people spent more than 20 days traveling around the troops and composed and told more than 40 drum ballads. Their writing ability is indeed very amazing.

    介绍刘金堂鼓书宣传队
    华飞
    刘金堂的鼓书宣传队在太岳区是很有名的。为农民服务、为兵服务都做出了显著的成绩，在改造民间旧艺人工作中，他起了带头作用。他们已经成为文教工作上一支有力的宣传教育农民的文化队伍。
    刘金堂是山西省太岳区阳城人，小时候被国民党反动派军队抓去当过年把勤务兵，那些反动军官经常逼着他去偷农民的萝＠吃，欺负农民，因为他是一个农民儿子，对于这些坏事非常难忍，就开小差回家学了说书，那时候（抗战前，解放前）说的净是些封建迷信书，谁家敬神、还愿、生了孩子满月，就雇他们去说书。四一年他家解放后，农民闹翻身，一切都在改造，农民开始对旧的封建的鼓书不欢迎了，他的鼓书再守旧就吃不开。在翻天复地的社会变革浪潮中，刘金堂就首先把他在蒋匪军内当勤务兵被逼偷萝＠偷菜的故事编成新鼓书，来暴露蒋匪军的罪恶，同时对比的说明解放军来了以后怎样好！这段说了以后，群众很欢迎，进一步鼓舞了他改编新书的信心。再加上抗日民主政府的领导与扶植，他从此便开始从封建书中蜕化出来，变成为人民服务的新鼓书队。
    之后，县政府便以他为典型，表扬他，推广他的经验借以教育和改造全县职业性，半职业性的一百多个旧说书的。使其都能在抗日民主政府领导下为人民服务。他们的办法是先组织刘金堂鼓书宣传队到全县各地去说新书，宣传新书的好处，启发民间旧艺人愿意改造自己的思想。然后，集中了一些积极分子开会训练，以刘金堂自己的切身经验说明旧书必须改造，并且可以改造好。并说明在旧社会里说旧书，人家不把咱当人看；在新社会里说新书，人民把咱当先生。说新书是光荣的，说旧书是没前途的。从此大家都争着学新书。都能结合农村中的中心工作进行鼓书宣传，政府里边有组织有计划的领导这一支力量。每逢一个中心工作布置前，如生产、扩军、农贷、备战等等，民教科便让刘金堂编鼓书，来配合动员群众实施这一工作。由于刘金堂本人是个农民，他对农民在各种工作中的思想情况摸的透，所以他能把一个原则问题，形象的生动的编成鼓书，使人听了不是干燥的条文，而是有骨有肉的东西，编好改好以后，就集合各鼓书组长来学习，学回去便普遍传开了。下面就是他编的“上冬学”的鼓书：
    姐妹们，众同胞，听我把冬学表一表。
    抗日政府有号召，各村设立冬学校。
    不分老，不分少，不分男女都到校。
    不识字真不好，到处吃亏可不少。
    欠人的，任人要，人欠咱多少忘记了。
    拿起算盘不会打，拿起笔来写不了。
    拿书不知颠和倒，只知白纸黑圪道。
    到如今，花钞票，认不得几元和几毛。
    到了街上买东西，拿上铁路票当冀钞。
    （当时山西出的铁路银行票）
    过去虽然有学校，穷人没钱人不教。
    共产党，来到了，黑暗社会才推倒。
    村村设立冬学校，大家快往学校跑。
    学校里，真正好，许多本事学不了。
    学识字，学写稿，学会记帐写路条。
    工农今天掌政权，这些本事很重要。
    学会算盘心有数，拐弯帐目也算得了。
    认得字多能看报，国际大事都知道。
    学上文化自己用，响马强盗偷不跑。
    现在日本已投降，冬学越要好好搞。
    可是有些老乡们，对冬学认识还不好。
    有的上学是挂号，有的是来凑热闹。
    教员耐心一直讲，他在下边瞌睡了。
    有的趁空就打闹，都说他是二半吊。
    大家要改老毛病，学习精神要提高。
    迟些回，早些到，不要跟着懒人学。
    纵然有啥要紧事，自己应打请假条。
    干部个个做模范，学员互相把战挑。
    大家争取当模范，典型冬学跑不了。
    ………………………………    
    他这一段书，不仅指出了不认字的害处与上冬学的好处，并且批判一些对上冬学不正确的态度，与提出应该抱怎样正确的态度，因此这一段书对动员上冬学起了很大作用。
    刘金堂鼓书宣传队不仅为农民服务服的好，并且为兵服务也做出了显著的成绩。一九四七年运城战役以后，他们到部队说书劳军，到哪个团说哪个团的英雄故事，模范战斗……当天到了就边搜集材料边编写，编好就说，甚至他听了材料可以马上上场就说。这种说真人真事对部队鼓舞很大，部队非常欢迎，他们八个人在部队里转了二十多天就编说了四十多篇鼓书，他们的编写能力的确也是很惊人的。
