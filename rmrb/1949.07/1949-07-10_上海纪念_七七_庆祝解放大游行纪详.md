　　The grand parade held by the military and civilians of Shanghai on the afternoon of the 6th to commemorate "July 7th" was an unprecedented parade and demonstration in Shanghai's history. This was a total review of the strength of the Shanghai people. In this city, which for many years had been the base for the combined aggression of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism against the Chinese people, the liberated people celebrated their great victory with unparalleled enthusiasm. On this day, the whole city rejoiced, red flags fluttered, crowds surged, and drums and gongs resounded.

　　Participating in this demonstration parade were three infantry divisions and eleven special forces regiments of the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army, 300,000 organized people's groups, and approximately one million citizens. The review and parade began at 4:00 PM and ended late at 12:00 AM. The infantry marched in five districts, while the special forces traveled through the city's main areas. All Shanghai people's organizations, except for a portion that rode trucks with the special forces, conducted district parades simultaneously.

　　At 4:00 PM sharp, Generals Chen Yi, Rao Shushi, and Su Yu, along with Shanghai party, government, and military leaders, and representatives from various agencies and organizations, reviewed the troops at the port headquarters on North Sichuan Road. Democratic figures Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Xu Guangping, Zhang Gangbo, Sheng Pihua, Wu Yaozong, and others also participated in the review.

　　The gigantic portraits of the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu appeared first amidst cheers. The flag of the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army fluttered in the wind, closely following the portraits. The first to be reviewed were the mechanized units, including the brave and skilled tank units, armored units, mechanized engineering units equipped with amphibious vehicles, a column of hundreds of American-made howitzers stretching for miles, anti-aircraft artillery units, and the First Regiment of the mechanized infantry division equipped entirely with American automatic weapons, led by twenty American-made rocket launchers, followed by the Second Regiment equipped entirely with Japanese weapons, and the Third Regiment equipped entirely with American weapons. Following the mechanized units were the colorful floats of Shanghai's various people's organizations. The preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions led the way in a truck, followed by the torch-bearing preparatory committee of the Democratic Youth Federation, the youth league students of the Shanghai Student Federation, the waist drum team of the Youth Cultural Work Troupe, and the floats of more than forty units, including the Democratic National Construction Association, the Women's Federation, the Education Union, the Transportation Company, the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the Shanghai Telephone Company, and the French Water and Electricity Company. After one float after another, the sound of rapid hoofbeats was heard, this was the cavalry. Behind the waving red flags, brave knights wielding shining sabers galloped past in two columns.

　　As the reviewed troops advanced continuously, the representatives from all walks of life on the reviewing stand and the spectators on both sides constantly erupted in fervent cheers. Especially when they saw the invincible new-style artillery rolling past, people felt an indescribable excitement in their hearts. Shouts of "Fight to Taiwan!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" resounded through the sky.

　　After the review, the parade began. The powerful people's mechanized units once again plunged into the torrent of the parade. The marching columns proceeded along North Sichuan Road, the Yangshupu workers' district, Nanjing Road, Gordon Road, Robison Road, Avenue Joffre, and Avenue Edward VII, stretching endlessly. At about 5:00 PM, heavy rain poured down, but the parading people became even more spirited and continued to advance. The cheering crowds, regardless of the rain, surged forward, and hundreds and thousands of hands reached out to the PLA soldiers on the trucks. The male and female students of Yucai School danced the yangko with an air of intoxication, and the employees of the Jinghu and Huhang Railway Bureaus ran closely behind the artillery vehicles, writing slogans such as "Muzzles aimed at Taiwan," "Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive," "Support the front with production," and "Use American goods to fight Old Chiang" on each cannon with colored chalk.

　　When the parade entered North Sichuan Road, a worker excitedly said: "Five years ago, North Sichuan Road was the base of Japanese imperialism. At that time, only armored vehicles that slaughtered the Chinese people roamed here. Forty days ago, the Kuomintang was still continuing to massacre the people here. But now, Shanghai belongs to the people, and the people's own powerful armed forces have appeared. How happy this is!"

　　When the column reached the Yangshupu workers' district, 150,000 workers, students, and teachers from the East District had been waiting for a long time. Organized worker brothers and sisters used megaphones to announce: "Our troops are here!" The red flags in everyone's hands immediately waved, and the sight of ten thousand red flags waving in the sea of people was like a rolling red wave. They desperately threw flowers and colored paper onto the people's soldiers, their guns, horses, and tanks. The soldiers' chests were filled with flowers. The six-mile-long road was covered with colorful confetti. Workers, students, and citizens presented 48 red flags, 100 silk banners, and 14 baskets of flowers to the parading People's Liberation Army. The workers of the Zhaofeng Textile Factory presented the largest silk banner, measuring 140 inches high and 96 inches wide, woven by themselves, which read: "Brave People's Liberation Army, we will always follow you!" When the workers saw the "Discipline Model Company," they excitedly said, "This is the most loving and disciplined team." They immediately presented a red flag with the words "Revolutionary Vanguard." A female worker representative, Tang Guifen, stood on the lead vehicle and shouted slogans excitedly. When a reporter asked her what she thought of the parade, she immediately replied excitedly: "This parade is unprecedented in history. Today, we see not only the power of the People's Liberation Army, but also the power of our great people. From now on, China will no longer suffer from imperialist aggression and the persecution of bureaucratic capitalists." A worker pointed to the Huangpu River and said: "In a hundred years, only today has the Huangpu River become ours. No more imperialist warships will dare to rampage here." The workers of the British Tramway Company specially repaired a "Shanghai Liberation" tram, painting the entire car bright red, inserting 22 red flags on the roof, and hanging portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in front of the car, running around all the tram tracks in Shanghai for a week.

　　On Nanjing Road, an old employee of the "San Yi Printing Company" carried a basket and squeezed into the ranks, forcing new towels, presented by the employees to comfort the troops, one by one under the soldiers' armpits and onto their belts. Children from the slum areas were also dancing the yangko to welcome the PLA. In the Southern District, workers from the Jiangnan Shipyard, embracing a model of the "Chongqing" warship that they had rushed to make in three days and nights, came to participate in the parade. The model was eight feet high and one zhang long, and the equipment on the ship was exactly the same as the original "Chongqing," with nearly 20 large and small cannons arranged on it. Zhou Xinquan, the workers' representative of the shipyard, said: "We made this model in three days and nights, and we will also work hard to build real warships and send them to the PLA to fight to Taiwan and Hainan Island!"

　　Along the way, people sent letters of appreciation to the PLA. From the millions of throats, written in millions of slogans and millions of letters, were powerful and consistent guarantees and requests: "We will always follow the Communist Party!" "Fight to Taiwan, fight to Guangzhou, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!"

　　上海纪念“七七”庆祝解放大游行纪详
    上海军民一百数十万人于六日下午举行的大游行，是上海有史以来规模空前的一次大游行、大示威。这是上海人民力量的总检阅。在这个过去多年来曾经是帝国主义与封建势力、官僚资本主义结合一起侵略中国人民的大本营，解放了的人民以无比的热情来庆祝自己的大胜利。在这一天，全市欢腾如狂，红旗招展，人山人海，锣鼓喧天。
    参加这次示威游行的，有人民解放军第三野战军的三个步兵师和十一个特种兵团，三十万有组织的人民团体队伍以及约百万市民。检阅和游行开始于下午四时，直至夜深十二时始结束。步兵分五区游行，特种部队则穿行全市主要地区。全市人民团体除一部分乘卡车随特种兵游行外，其余则同时进行分区游行。
    下午四时正，陈毅、饶漱石、粟裕三将军偕同上海党政军各首长、各机关各团体代表在北四川路港口司令部检阅部队。民主人士黄炎培、陈叔通、许广平、张纲伯、盛丕华、吴耀宗等亦参与检阅。
    中国人民领袖毛主席和朱总司令的巨像在一阵欢呼声中最先出现。人民解放军第三野战军的军旗紧随巨像迎风飘扬。最先受检阅的是机械化部队，其中有英勇善战的战车部队、装甲部队，配有水陆两用汽车的机械化工兵部队，迤延数里的百门美式榴弹炮队，高射炮队，和以二十门美式火箭炮为前导的全部美械自动火器装备的机械化步兵团第一团，全部日式装备的第二团，全部美式装备的第三团等部队，机械化部队过后，接着是五彩缤纷的上海各人民团体的彩车。市总工会筹备会的卡车在最前面，跟着是高举火炬的民主青年联合会筹委会、上海学联的青年团学生们，青年文艺工作团的腰鼓队、以及民主建国会、妇联、教联、交通公司、上海电力公司、上海电话公司、法商水电公司等四十余单位的花车。一辆又一辆的花车过后，传来了急促的马蹄声，这是骑兵部队，在招展的大红旗后，勇敢的骑士们手执闪光的马刀，成两路纵队疾驰而过。
    当受检阅的部队接连前进时，检阅台上的各界代表和两旁的观众不断发出狂热的欢呼，特别是看到无坚不摧的新式大炮行列滚滚而过，人们心里更是感到不可言喻的兴奋。“打到台湾去！”“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“中国人民解放军万岁！”的口号声响澈云霄。
    检阅过后，即开始游行。强大的人民机械化部队又投入了游行的洪流里。游行队伍经北四川路、杨树浦工人区、南京路、戈登路、劳勃生路、霞飞路、爱多亚路等，延绵不绝的前进着。五时许，大雨如注，但游行的人们，都更加抖擞起精神前进，欢呼的人群也不顾雨水涌过来，成千成百的手伸向卡车上的解放军战士们。育才学校的男女学生如醉如狂的扭着秧歌，京沪、沪杭铁路局的职工们跑步紧随炮车，用纷笔在每个炮身上写着：“炮口对准台湾”、“活捉蒋介石”、“支前生产”、“用美国货打老蒋”等标语。
    游行队伍进入北四川路时，一个工人激动地说：“五年以前，北四川路是日本帝国主义的大本营，那时只有屠杀中国人民的铁甲车在这里横行。四十天以前，国民党也还在这里继续屠杀人民。但是现在，上海属于人民了，人民自己的强大的武装出现了，这是多么叫人高兴啊！”
    队伍行至杨树浦工人区时，东区的十五万职工和学生、教员们老早就在等着了。有组织的工人弟兄姊妹们用喊话筒传过去：“我们的队伍来啦！”每个人手里的红旗立即挥动起来，看人海中万面红旗招展，如红浪翻滚。他们把鲜花彩纸拼命地向人民战士的身上、枪上、马头上、坦克上、装甲车上撒去，战士胸前都被插满了花。长达六里的马路都铺满了彩色纸屑。职工、学生、市民把四十八面红旗、一百面锦旗和十四篮鲜花献给游行的人民解放军。兆丰纺织厂职工献的是自织的高一百四十时宽九十六时的最大一面锦旗，上写着：“英勇的人民解放军，永远跟着你走！”职工们看到“遵纪模范连”时，兴奋地说：“这是爱民最好、纪律最严明的队伍”。他们马上献给一面写着“革命先锋”的红旗。女工代表汤桂芬站在前导车上，兴奋地叫着口号。当记者问她对这次游行有何感想时，她立即兴奋地回答：“这次游行在历史上是空前的。今天看到的不只是人民解放军的力量，而且是伟大的我们人民的力量。从现在起，中国再也不会遭受帝国主义侵略和官僚资本家的迫害了。”一个工人遥指着黄浦江说：“一百年来，只在今天，黄浦江才变成咱们的了，再也没有帝国主义的军舰敢在这里横行霸道了。”英商电车公司工人特地赶修了一部“上海解放号”车，全车身漆得鲜红，车顶分插二十二面红旗，车前悬挂毛主席、朱总司令的肖像，在上海所有的电车轨上行驶一周。
    在南京路，一位“三一印刷公司”的老职员，背着一只筐子挤到队伍里，把职工们慰劳部队的新毛巾一条一条地硬塞到战士们的腋下、皮带上。贫民区的孩子们也在扭着秧歌欢迎解放军。在南区，江南造船所的工人们拥着他们三日夜赶制成功的“重庆号兵舰”的模型，赶来参加游行。该模型高八尺，长一丈，舰上设备都和原来的“重庆号”一模一样，近二十门大小炮排列在上面。造船所工人代表周新泉说：“我们三日夜造成了这个模型，我们还要努力制造真的兵舰，送给解放军，打到台湾和海南岛去！”
    一路上人民向解放军投送着慰劳信。从千万个喉咙里喊出来的，在千万条标语和千万封信里写着的，是强有力的一致的保证和要求：“我们永远跟着共产党走！”“打到台湾去，打到广州去，活捉蒋介石！”
