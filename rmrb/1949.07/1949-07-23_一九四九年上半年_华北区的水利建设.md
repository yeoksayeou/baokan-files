　　Agricultural Department, Farmland Water Conservancy Division

　　Since the plan to increase irrigated land by one million mu by opening canals and one million mu by utilizing wells and springs was formulated at the First North China Agriculture and Forestry Conference in January this year, after half a year of efforts by the masses in various regions under the strong leadership of governments at all levels to achieve this goal, as of the end of June, the entire region has achieved the following results:
　　I. Opening Canals: More than 2,000 new canals were opened and existing canals were repaired in the entire North China region, increasing irrigated land by 1,248,695 mu, including: 1. Chahar Province: 285,714 mu (including 6 new canals in Jianping Special District, increasing irrigated land by 870 mu; 3 old canals repaired, restoring and expanding irrigated land by 5,951 mu; 31 new canals in Yishui Special District, increasing irrigated land by 13,675 mu; 82 old canals repaired, increasing irrigated land by 4,335 mu. 67 new canals in Pingxi Special District, increasing irrigated land by 11,908 mu; old canals repaired, restoring irrigated land by 317 mu. 98 new canals in Chanan Special District, increasing irrigated land by 70,549 mu; 59 old canals repaired, expanding irrigated land by 47,551 mu. 42 new canals in Yanbei Special District, increasing irrigated land by 28,931 mu; 82 old canals repaired, expanding irrigated land by 66,193 mu. 172 new canals in Nankou Special District, increasing irrigated land by 17,890 mu; 2 old canals repaired, expanding irrigated land by 7,806 mu. 11 new canals in Chabei Special District, increasing irrigated land by 4,967 mu; 87 old canals repaired, expanding irrigated land by 4,771 mu). 2. Central Hebei Region: The entire region increased irrigated land (including paddy fields) by 92,418 mu (including 31,218 mu of paddy fields increased by the Anxin Irrigation Canal; 116 springs opened by the Dingxian Mapao Spring Canal, 66 branch canals opened, increasing irrigated land by 1,000 mu; the Gu Ba Canal in Gu'an, Ba County, and Xiong County, opened 12.5 kilometers of main canal, and repaired branch canals, increasing irrigated land by 44,200 mu; the Jin Gao Irrigation Canal in Jin County and Gaocheng County, in addition to repairing the diversion river, clearing silt, reinforcing embankments, and building dams and blocking openings, also opened main and branch canals, increasing irrigated land by 1,600 mu). 3. Southern Hebei Region: In Handan, Jize, Yongnian, Ningnan, and other counties, branch canals were repaired, expanding irrigated land by 63,000 mu. 4. Eastern Hebei: The entire region opened 72 canals, increasing irrigated land by 156,935 mu (including 1 in Qian'an, increasing irrigated land by 200 mu; 3 in Yutian, increasing irrigated land by 115,050 mu; 2 in Baodi, increasing irrigated land by 170 mu; 66 in Ninghe, increasing irrigated land by 41,515 mu). 5. Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region: The Tianlai Canal was repaired, increasing irrigated land by 13,000 mu. 6. Taiyue Region: The entire region repaired and newly opened 91 canals, increasing irrigated land by 47,774 mu. 7. Taihang Region: Repaired and newly opened 933 canals, increasing irrigated land by 134,622 mu (including 27 canals opened and repaired in Xingtai, Neiqiu, and other six counties in the First Special District, increasing irrigated land by 16,638 mu; 4 canals opened and repaired in Qinyang, Bo'ai, and other five counties in the Fourth Special District, increasing irrigated land by 56,550 mu; 37 canals opened and repaired in Qi, Hui, and other six counties in the Fifth Special District, increasing irrigated land by 38,988 mu). 8. Taiyuan City (Jinzhong Administrative Office): The entire region opened canals to increase irrigated land by 327,000 mu (including 6,468 mu in the First Special District, 238,663 mu in the Second Special District, and 81,809 mu in the Third Special District). 9. Suiyuan Province: The entire province opened 38 new canals and restored old canals, increasing irrigated land by 108,232 mu. 10. The Shijiazhuang-Jinan Canal irrigation project directly led by the Ministry of Agriculture has completed the irrigation project of 200,000 mu, and has now released water to irrigate 20,000 mu.
　　II. Waterwheels and Wells: The entire region increased by 8,889 waterwheels, repaired 18,980 old waterwheels; newly dug 6,127 brick and stone wells, repaired 20,408 brick and stone wells; in addition, 157,830 earthen wells were dug, which can not only regularly irrigate 400,000 mu of land, but also guarantee timely sowing of 2 million mu of land. The development of waterwheels and wells in various regions is roughly as follows: 1. Chahar Province: The entire province increased by 2,647 waterwheels, repaired 1,963 waterwheels, newly dug 1,531 brick and stone wells, repaired 2,033 brick and stone wells, and newly dug 7,476 earthen wells. 2. Central Hebei Region: Increased by 3,553 waterwheels, repaired 9,335 old waterwheels, newly dug 3,429 brick and stone wells, repaired 10,124 brick and stone wells, and newly dug 102,280 earthen wells. 3. Southern Shandong Region: Increased by 3,553 waterwheels, repaired 3,814 waterwheels, dug 11,000 wells, and repaired 4,295 old wells. 4. Taihang Region: Increased by 413 waterwheels, repaired 2,683 waterwheels, dug 366 wells, and repaired 554 old wells. 5. Taiyue Region: Increased and repaired 1,057 waterwheels, and repaired 954 wells. 6. Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region: Increased by 21 waterwheels, dug 689 brick wells, repaired 2,311 brick wells, and dug 24,682 earthen wells. 7. Eastern Hebei Region: Increased by 739 waterwheels, and dug 12,352 wells. 8. Suburbs of Shijiazhuang City: Increased by 213 waterwheels, repaired 128 waterwheels, newly dug 112 brick wells, and repaired 137 brick wells.
　　In total, the entire region increased canal-irrigated land by 1.25 million mu and well-irrigated land by 400,000 mu, completing 82.5 percent of the plan to increase irrigated land by 2 million mu. This year's water conservancy work has achieved considerable results, and the number of increased paddy fields has greatly exceeded previous years. The reasons are:
　　I. The development of the war situation has encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for construction. In addition, the reduction of war service tasks, the liberation of large cities, the relatively sufficient supply of materials, and the convenience of transportation have all exceeded the past.
　　II. After the land reform was completed and land rights were determined, the concerns of the masses were reduced, consolidating and improving the masses' desire to improve technology and farmland. Farmers in many areas actively demanded to build water conservancy projects on their own land.
　　III. The leadership has been strengthened, and the allocation of specialized cadres and the organization of water conservancy institutions have been strengthened. Various regions have carried out specific organizational work in a relatively in-depth manner, and have promoted democracy and established a wider range of mass water conservancy organizations (such as the organization of canal committees and water conservancy committees). This is particularly evident in Chahar Province, where the masses are comprehensively led, water conservancy is developed, and larger projects are planned and constructed. For example, the establishment of water conservancy promotion agencies, through business activities to mobilize the masses, develop water conservancy, and solve many difficult problems, has played a great role in the development of waterwheels and wells.
　　IV. This year's widespread spring drought in North China has greatly stimulated the attention of leaders at all levels to water conservancy work. Many waterwheels were loaned out after May, more than 100,000 earthen wells were dug in a concentrated effort in Central Hebei, and 12,000 wells were temporarily arranged to be dug in Southern Hebei. Other regions also opened many small canals in a concentrated effort, which solved a great deal of water supply problems during the drought-resistant sowing period.
　　V. Improving water conservancy management, some places have broken the old feudal and unreasonable traditions, formulated new and more reasonable systems and methods, and solved the problems of water use, water types, and burdens more fairly, reducing disputes and saving water waste, and increasing irrigated land. For example, Taiyuan City's emphasis on the management of Fenhe water conservancy and Jianping Special Commissioner's Office's progress in the management of Ji San Canal.
　　However, on the other hand, there are still many shortcomings in the leadership of water conservancy work: Some regions have not yet regarded the development of water conservancy as a long-term undertaking that must be led in a planned manner. They only dig wells, open canals, and lend out waterwheels when there is a drought, and stop everything when it rains. They have not seriously realized that North China is a region where nine out of ten years are dry, and agricultural production must be centered on water. Therefore, some regions have not done a good job in specific organization, but are only making general appeals; in the use of loans, some regions only distribute loans evenly, regardless of the actual needs, and even many loans cannot be loaned out in time, or are not loaned out at all. In the implementation of work, they do not establish professional institutions, or do not care about professional organizations. Some professional organizations ignore the interests and needs of the masses and have a purely profit-making perspective. Still others, because they do not pay enough attention to the work, can neither go deep into the masses to understand the situation, nor report to the higher authorities in a timely manner, increasing the difficulty of leadership. In the management of canals, some places have still not completely transformed the old feudal organizations, and have not strengthened the management of water distribution between the upper and lower reaches, so disputes have not yet stopped. This deserves serious attention and improvement in the future.

　　一九四九年上半年
    华北区的水利建设
    农业部农田水利处
    自从今年一月在第一届华北农林会议上拟定开渠增加水浇地一百万亩，利用井泉增加水浇地一百万亩的计划之后，经半年来各地群众在各级政府的坚强领导下，一致为实现此一目标而努力的结果，截至六月底止，总计全区已获得以下的成绩：
    一、开渠　华北全区新开及修复旧有渠道二千余道，共增加水浇地一、二四八、六九五亩，其中包括：１、察哈尔省二八五、七一四亩（计建屏专区新开渠六道，增加水浇地八七○亩，修整旧渠三道，恢复及扩大水浇地五、九五一亩，易水专区新开渠三十一道，增加水浇地一三、六七五亩，恢复修整旧渠道八十二道，增加水浇地四、三三五亩。平西专区新开渠六十七道，增加水浇地一一、九○八亩，修整旧渠恢复水浇地三一七亩。察南专区新闻渠九十八道，增加水浇地七○、五四九亩，修整旧渠五十九道，增扩水浇地四七、五五一亩。雁北专区新开渠四十二道，增加水浇地二八、九三一亩，修整旧渠八十二道，增扩水浇地六六、一九三亩。南口专区新开渠一百七十二道，增加水浇地一七、八九○亩，修整旧渠二道，增扩水浇地七、八○六亩。察北专区新开渠十一道，增加水浇地四、九六七亩，修整旧渠八十七道，增扩水浇地四、七七一亩）。２、冀中区全区共增加水浇地（包括稻田）九二、四一八亩（计安新灌溉渠增加稻田三一、二一八亩；定县马刨泉渠开泉一一六眼，增开支渠六十六道，增加水浇地一、○○○亩；固安霸县雄县境内的固霸渠，开干渠十二公里半，并修整支渠，增加水浇地四四、二○○亩；晋县藁城境内的晋藁灌溉渠，除修整引河、清淤、培堤、打坝、堵口外，加开干支渠，增加水浇地一、六○○亩）。３、冀南区在邯郸、鸡泽、永年、宁南等县，修整支渠，增扩水浇地六三、○○○亩。４、冀东全区开渠七十二道，增加水浇地一五六、九三五亩（计迁安一道，增加水浇地二○○亩，玉田三道，增加水浇地一一五、○五○亩；宝坻二道，增加水浇地一七○亩；宁河六十六道，增加水浇地四一、五一五亩）。５、冀鲁豫区修整天赉渠，增加水浇地一三、○○○亩。６、太岳区全区共修复及新开渠九十一道，增加水浇地四七、七七四亩。７、太行区修整及新开渠九百三十三道，增加水浇地一三四、六二二亩（计一专区邢台、内邱等六县开修渠二十七道，增加水浇地一六、六三八亩；四专区沁阳、博爱等五县开修渠四道，增加水浇地五六、五五○亩；五专区淇、辉等六县开修渠三十七道，增加水浇地三八、九八八亩）。８、太原市（晋中行署）全区开渠增加水浇地三二七、○○○亩（计一专区六、四六八亩，二专区二三八、六六三亩，三专区八一、八○九亩）。９、绥远省全省共开新渠及恢复旧渠三十八道，增加水浇地一○八、二三二亩。１０、由农业部直接领导的石津运河灌溉工程，已完成二十万亩的灌溉工程，现已放水浇地二万亩。
    二、水车水井　全区共增加水车八、八八九辆，修复旧水车一八、九八○辆；新打砖石井六、一二七眼，修复砖石井二○、四○八眼；此外并打土井一五七、八三○眼，除能经常浇地四十万亩外，并保证了二百万亩的土地及时播种。各地水车水井的发展情况约略如下：１、察哈尔省全省增加水车二、六四七辆，修复水车一、九六三辆，新打砖石井一、五三一眼，修复砖石井二、○三三眼，新打土井七、四七六眼。２、冀中区增加水车三、五五三辆，修复旧水车九、三三五辆，新打砖石井三、四二九眼，修复砖石井一○、一二四眼，新打土井一○二、二八○眼。３、鲁南区增加水车三、五五三辆，修复水车三、八一四辆，打井一一、○○○眼，修复旧井四、二九五眼。４、太行区增加水车四一三辆，修复水车二、六八三辆，打井三六六眼，修复旧井五五四眼。５、太岳区增加修复水车一、○五七辆，修井九五四眼。６、冀鲁豫区增加水车二十一辆，打砖井六八九眼，修复砖井二、三一一眼，打土井二四、六八二眼。７、冀东区增加水车七三九辆，打井一二、三五二眼。８、石家庄市郊增加水车二一三辆，修复水车一二八辆，新打砖井一一二眼，修复砖井一三七眼。
    总计上述各项，全区共增加渠浇地一百二十五万亩、井浇地四十万亩，已完成增加水浇地二百万亩计划的百分之八十二点五。今年的水利工作，已有相当的成绩，水田增加的数量，大大的超过往年，其原因是：
    一、由于战争形势的开展，鼓舞了群众对建设的积极性，再加战勤任务的减少，大城市的解放，材料的供给上比较充分，运输比较便利等都超过以往。
    二、土改结束，地权确定之后，群众的顾虑减少了，巩固和提高了群众要求改良技术、改良耕地的情绪，很多地区的农民，积极要求在自己的土地上兴修水利。
    三、领导的加强，并加强了专责干部的配置，与水利机构的组织，各地区比较的深入进行具体组织工作，并发扬了民主，建立了较为广泛的群众性的水利组织（如渠委会、水利委会的组织），这特别是表现在察哈尔省，全面的领导群众，开展水利，并有计划的兴修了较大的工程。又如水利推进社的建立，通过业务活动去发动群众，开发水利，解决了不少的困难问题，在发展水车水井的工作上，起了很大的作用。
    四、今年华北普遍春旱，相当的激发了各级领导对水利工作的重视，水车在五月后贷出的很多，冀中突击挖土井十万多眼，冀南临时布置打井一万二千眼，其他各区突击开小渠的也很多，这在抗旱播种期间，解决了很大的水量供给问题。
    五、改进水利管理，有些地方打破了旧的封建的不合理的传统，制定了新的较合理的制度和办法，比较公平的解决了使水、水种和负担的问题，减少了纷争，并节省了水的浪费，增加了水浇地。如太原市对汾河水利管理的重视，建屏专署对计三渠在管理方面的进步等。
    但另一方面，在水利工作的领导上，尚存有不少缺点：若干地区还没有把发展水利作为一个长期性的事业，必须有计划的进行领导，天旱了才去打井、开渠、出贷水车，下了雨又都停止了。还没有严重的认识到华北是个十年九旱的地区，农业的生产，必须以水为中心，因此有些地区没有很好的去具体组织，还只是一般号召；在贷款的使用上，有的地区只是平均分配贷款，不问事实的需要如何，甚至很多贷款不能及时贷下去，或竟不出贷，在执行工作上不去建立专业机构，或不关心专业组织，有的专业组织忽视群众利益与需要，单纯的营利观点，更有的因为对工作不够重视，既不能深入群众了解情况，又不向上级及时报告，增加领导上的困难。在渠道的管理上有些地方仍然没有完全改造旧的封建组织，对上下游水量的分配没有加强管理，因而还没有停止纠纷，这是值得今后严重注意改进的。
