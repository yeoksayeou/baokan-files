Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd—TASS, London, 1st—The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party recently issued a statement saying: The British people are facing the danger of economic decline and increased mass unemployment. The statement pointed out: "The outbreak of the conflict between Britain and the United States over the European payments issue, and the ruthless pressure exerted by the United States to obtain an agreement—an agreement that would severely reduce Britain's gold and dollar reserves—are the result of the rapidly developing economic decline in the United States and the entire capitalist world." Although British production and exports have increased, the situation of the working people has deteriorated. Now, the capitalists' markets are shrinking, and extremely fierce competition is developing between capitalist countries. The low-wage industries of West Germany and Japan, controlled by large American capitalists, are challenging British exports, threatening the British textile and shipbuilding industries. With the disappearance of post-war prosperity, capitalist countries are facing economic decline, and the United States, as the most powerful capitalist country in the world today, is already in an economic downturn. In this situation, the United States not only wants to strengthen its competition in the capitalist world market, but also to increase its dictatorial power in the Marshall Plan as a means of overcoming its overproduction and to prevent countries receiving Marshall Plan aid from signing trade agreements with other countries.

The statement continued: No country has suffered as much from the capitalist world crisis as Britain. The war exposed the collapse of British imperialism's old monopoly position. All developments after the war have further weakened the position of British imperialism, proving the bankruptcy of attempts to resolve the British crisis by continuing imperialist policies. The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party condemned the Labor government for pursuing policies that serve the interests of the United States and British capitalists. The statement said: "Everything the government is doing and planning to do can only strengthen the factors that cause further decline, reduce domestic purchasing power, and intensify the competition and conflict among capitalists in the international arena." The British Communist Party demands a revision of this policy. It calls for reducing military spending and stopping the freeze on wages, reducing compensation paid to former owners of nationalized industries, raising wages and improving workers' living conditions. The statement also emphasized the urgent need to immediately conclude large-scale trade agreements with the Soviet Union, Eastern European countries, and democratic China. The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party finally declared that only by pursuing a policy based on these demands can economic decline and war be prevented.

　　英面临经济危机
  　英共发表声明
  　要求立即与苏联等国贸易
    【新华社北平二日电】塔斯社伦敦一日讯：英国共产党执行委员会顷表声明称：英国人民面临着经济下跌与大规模失业增长的危险。该声明指出：“英美之间在欧洲支付问题上的冲突的爆发，以及美国为了取得协议——这种协议会严重削减英国的黄金与美元准备——而加诸的无情压力，乃是美国国内及整个资本主义世界迅速发展着的经济下跌的结果。”虽然英国的生产和出口已有增加，但是劳动人民的情况却恶化了。现在，资本家的市场正在萎缩，资本主义国家之间正开展着极剧烈的竞争。美国大企业主控制下的西德和日本的工资低廉的工业，正向英国的出口挑战，威胁着英国的纺织工业与造船工业。随着战后繁荣的消失，各资本主义国家正面临着经济下跌，而作为现在世界上最强大的资本主义国家的美国，则已经处于经济下跌中。在这种情形下，美国不仅要加强它在资本主义世界市场上的竞争，而且也要增加其在马歇尔计划中的独裁的力量，作为克服其生产过剩的手段，并以此阻止接受马歇尔计划援助的国家与其他国家签订贸易协定。
    声明继称：世界上没有一个国家遭受资本主义世界危机的影响之大，有象英国这样。战争暴露了英帝国主义旧有垄断地位的崩溃。战后的一切发展，更进一步地削弱了英帝国主义的地位，证明了继续帝国主义政策以解决英国危机的企图的破产。英共执委会谴责工党政府奉行为美国和英国资本家之利益服务的政策。该声明称：“政府所正在作的和计划要作的一切，只能加强造成进一步下跌的因素、减低国内的购买力、以及加剧资本家在国际逐鹿场上的竞争与冲突。”英国共产党要求修改这一政策。它要求减少军事开支和停止冻结工资，减少对国有化工业前业主支付的补偿费，提高工资并改善工人的生活条件。声明又强调迫切需要立即与苏联、东欧国家和民主中国立即缔结大规模的贸易协定。英共执委会最后宣称，只有奉行以这些要求为基础的政策，才能防止经济下跌和战争。
