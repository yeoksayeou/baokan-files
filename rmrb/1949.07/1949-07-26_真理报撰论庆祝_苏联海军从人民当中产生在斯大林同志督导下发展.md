Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: Moscow dispatch: *Pravda*'s editorial celebrating Navy Day writes: The Soviet people love their navy and naval art. They feel a deep patriotic pride in the glorious traditions of the Russian navy that stretch back centuries. The history of the Russian navy has many glorious achievements. And its most brilliant page is the role the Russian navy played in the revolutionary movement, in the October Socialist Revolution, and in the struggle to defend the freedom and independence of the Soviet state. Strictly speaking, the Soviet navy was born from the people. The people's great leader, Stalin, personally supervised the development of the navy and constantly paid attention to the training of naval personnel. *Pravda* emphasized that this is precisely why, during the war launched against us by Hitler's Germany, the Soviet navy gloriously fulfilled its obligations to the motherland and proved itself to be a loyal and reliable assistant to the Soviet army. Soviet naval art, an inseparable part of progressive Stalinist military science, solved the problem of coordinated action between various arms of service in new ways. The victory of the Soviet navy in World War II was precisely won on the basis of coordinated action with the army and air force. *Pravda* also stated: The Soviet people are vigilantly guarding the war-mongers' conspiracies to find new naval bases and to use the naval bases of Marshallized countries. This is an inseparable part of their strategic plan to prepare for new aggression. However, the era in which aggressors could smoothly carry out their evil plans has passed. The growing strength of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp is now and will continue to be able to relegate them to shameful failure. This powerful camp is headed by the Soviet Union. We have been tirelessly and resolutely defending the cause of peace; we must work tirelessly to further strengthen our armed forces, including the navy of our motherland.

　　真理报撰论庆祝
    苏联海军从人民当中产生在斯大林同志督导下发展
    【新华社北平二十五日电】莫斯科讯：真理报庆祝海军节的社论写道：苏联人民热爱他们的海军与海军艺术。他们以数世纪之久的俄国海军的辉煌传统而感到深深的爱国主义的骄傲。俄国海军的历史，有着许多辉煌的功绩。而它的最光辉的一页，则是俄国海军在革命运动中，在十月社会主义革命中，在保卫苏维埃国家自由与独立的斗争中所起的作用。严格地说，苏联海军是从人民当中产生的。人民的伟大领袖斯大林，曾亲自督导海军的发展，经常注意训练海军人员，真理报强调称，这恰恰就是为什么在希特勒德国对我们发动战争期间，苏联海军光荣地完成了它对祖国的义务，并且证明了它是苏联陆军忠诚而可靠的助手。为进步的斯大林军事科学之不可分的一部分的苏联海军艺术，用新的方法解决了各种兵种配合行动的问题。苏联海军在第二次世界大战中的胜利，恰恰就是在与陆、空军配合行动的基础上赢得的。真理报又称：苏联人民，正在警惕地警戒着战争贩子找寻新海军基地、及利用马歇尔化国家海军基地的阴谋。这是他们准备新侵略的战略计划之不可分的一部分。但是，侵略者能够顺利地执行其罪恶计划的时代已经过去了。日益增长的民主与反帝国主义阵营的力量，现在和将来都能够使他们归于可耻的失败。这个强有力的阵营是以苏联为首的。我们一直在不屈不挠地、坚决地保卫着和平事业；我们必须为进一步加强我们武装部队，包括我们祖国的海军而不倦地工作。
