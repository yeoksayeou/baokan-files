Punish Air Bandit Chennault
　　He Sijing

　　A France-Presse dispatch from Hong Kong on the 6th, citing the Hong Kong Wah Kiu Yat Po on the 6th, reported that Chennault will come to China to directly command the Kuomintang bandit gang's air banditry, and will apply for "Chinese nationality" after arriving in Guangzhou. A Central News Agency dispatch from Guangzhou on the 6th from the bandit gang stated that the Guangdong Provincial Council held its 25th Standing Committee meeting on the 6th and passed a resolution to award Chennault the title of "Honorary Citizen" of Guangdong Province.

　　This is a bizarre piece of news! This is one end of the countless conspiracies and acts of collusion between US imperialism and the Chiang bandits. This end shows that US imperialism is trying every possible means to carry out armed interference in China through disguised methods. But this end also shows how desperate both sides have become.

　　The imperialist thug Chennault, leading a group of followers, wants to carry out the imperialist policy of armed interference, but is intimidated by the righteous anger of the people of the world, including the American people. Therefore, he tries his best to change his appearance. Since it is impossible to transform himself, he comes up with a legal means to carry out his air banditry. This legal means is to "apply for Chinese nationality," which is one of the deceptive means commonly used by US imperialists.

　　Undoubtedly, since the Kuomintang bandit gang is offering the title of "Honorary Citizen" to an American imperialist thug, what problem would there be for this foreign thug to obtain "Chinese nationality" from Chiang Kai-shek? Citizens of a certain country must comply with the prescribed conditions to obtain the nationality of another country, but these conditions will not count for the US-Chiang bandit gang.

　　This is Chiang Kai-shek's arbitrary act of selling out nationality, and this act itself is an act of treason. In the past, Chiang Kai-shek sold out China's sovereignty and many economic lifelines. If we do not expose their open and secret treasonous contracts, it will seem unbelievable without written proof. But just by looking at how rampant and lawless US imperialists are in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas, anyone can intuitively feel that we Chinese people have lost basic rights, basic national rights, economic interests, and basic human rights in the face of US imperialists. But selling out nationality itself is directly an act of treason. If a traitor thoroughly sells out nationality, what can he hide his treasonous crimes with?

　　"We award General Chennault the title of Honorary Citizen of Guangdong Province is a custom of civilized countries." Perhaps you say that. But why do you offer the title of "Honorary Citizen" to Chennault? To command your "First Line Air Force, composed of American volunteer air squadrons" and using American planes, to participate in the civil war, kill and injure the Chinese people, and destroy the Chinese people's production and transportation undertakings! Whether offering the title of "Honorary Citizen" or "Chinese Citizen," your purpose is to have American air bandits destroy the lives and property of the Chinese people. This is the so-called custom of civilized countries, this is your criminal civilized custom. By doing so, you will soon be punished by the people. However, you have added an "Honorary Citizen" to accompany your shameful batch of civil war criminals.

　　It is very possible that Chennault is just publicizing that he wants to "apply for Chinese nationality," but does not go through any procedures, and then commands the Chiang bandit air force, because today it is impossible to go to the Chiang bandit's nest to investigate whether Chennault has gone through the procedures. "Applying for Chinese nationality" is very likely pure deception, because people like Chennault would never want to be Chinese. But as long as he goes to Chiang Kai-shek's place to command the air force to participate in the civil war, the Chinese people have the right to declare Chennault a war criminal. If he truly abandons his American nationality and obtains "Chinese nationality," then he is a war criminal of the civil war. If he does not abandon his American nationality, then he is an armed interventionist in the Chinese People's Liberation War, and also a war criminal. Not abandoning American nationality, he can also pose as a Chinese national, or become a dual national of China and the United States, at this time, he is an armed interventionist and also a civil war criminal. In short, he cannot escape the trial of the Chinese people. No matter where he flees to, the Chinese people must pursue him to the end.

　　Failure to punish these air bandits cannot safeguard the security and basic rights of the Chinese and world people; failure to punish this type of imperialist will not only make it difficult to enhance the friendship between the Chinese and American people, but also make it difficult to maintain.

　　惩办空中强盗陈纳德
    何思敬
    法新社香港六日电引香港华侨日报六日载陈纳德将来华直接指挥国民党匪帮底空中强盗行为，并俟到达广州后即将申请“中国国籍”。而匪帮中央社广州六日电则谓粤省参会六日举行第二十五次驻委会议，已通过颁赠陈纳德为广东省“荣誉公民”。
    这是一个离奇的消息！这是美帝与蒋匪之间无数阴谋、无数狼狈为奸的犯罪行为之一端。这一端表明美帝国主义者千方百计地想武装干涉中国而采取变相的方法。但这一端也表明双方已到了何等穷极无聊的地步。
    帝国主义流氓陈纳德，带了一群喽罗要执行帝国主义武装干涉政策，但慑于全世界人民以至美国人民底正义的愤怒，故竭力设法改头换面，又苦于不可能摇身一变，于是就想出一个法律手段来进行其空中强盗行为。这法律手段就是“申请中国国籍”，也就是美帝国主义者常用的欺骗手段之一。
    无疑的，国民党匪帮既将“荣誉公民”底尊号奉献给一个美帝国主义流氓，那末，这个外国流氓之从蒋匪手中取得“中国国籍”还会有什么问题呢？某国人取得他国国籍必须遵从规定的各条件，但这些条件对美蒋匪帮不会算数了。
    这是蒋匪任意出卖国籍的行为，这个行为本身已是一个卖国行为。过去蒋匪出卖了中国主权，出卖了许许多多经济命脉，如果不揭发他们底公开的以至秘密的卖国契约，就好象无文证可凭，难于令人置信。但只要一看美帝国主义者在蒋匪区中何等横行霸道无法无天，谁都可以直觉到我们中国人在美帝国主义者面前一定丧失了基本权利，基本的国家权利、经济利益和基本人权。但出卖国籍本身，直接就是卖国行为。卖国贼彻底到了出卖国籍，他还有什么可以掩盖自己底卖国罪恶呢？
    “我们颁赠陈纳德将军为广东省荣誉公民是文明国底习惯。”也许你们这样说。但你们奉献“荣誉公民”底尊号给陈纳德干什么呢？指挥你们底“由美国志愿航空中队组成”并使用美国飞机的“第一线空军”来参加内战，杀伤中国人民，破坏中国人民底生产和交通事业！奉献“荣誉公民”也好，“中国公民”也好，你们底目的就是要美国空中强盗来破坏中国人民底生命财产。这就是你们所谓文明国底习惯，这就是你们犯罪底文明习惯。你们这样做，你们不久就会受到人民的惩罚。不过你们倒多了一个“荣誉公民”来做你们这批可耻的内战战犯底陪榜了。
    很有可能陈纳德只不过宣传一下要“申请中国国籍”，但不办任何手续，就指挥蒋匪空军，因为今天无法到蒋匪窝子中去调查陈纳德有没有办手续。“申请中国国籍”很可能是纯粹的欺骗，因为陈纳德之流根本不会想做中国人。但只要他到蒋匪那里去指挥空军参加内战，中国人民就有权利宣布陈纳德为战犯。如果他真正抛弃了美国国籍，并取得了“中国国籍”，那末，他就是内战底战犯。如果他不抛弃美国国籍，那末，他是中国人民解放战争底武装干涉者，也是战犯。不抛弃美国国籍，也可以冒充中国国籍，也可以成为中美二重国籍者，这时会，他就是武装干涉者同时又是内战战犯。总而言之，他逃不掉中国人民底审判。无论他逃到天涯地角，中国人民一定要追究到底。
    不惩办这些空中强盗不能维护中国与世界人民底安全与基本权利；不惩办这类帝国主义者，中美两国人民底友谊不仅很难增进，而且很难维系。
