　　Railway Worker Heroes
　　Shake Hands with Chairman Mao
　　"We can see Chairman Mao today!" The representatives of railway workers from all over the country, the representatives of the National Locomotive Conference, braved the heavy rain at 5:00 PM and entered the venue. "Huairentang," a palace of imperial autocracy that the working class could not enter in the past, became the venue for the working class today.
　　After Comrade Zhou Enlai finished his speech, people were talking about Chairman Mao's imminent arrival. Any slight movement at the east and west entrances of the auditorium would immediately draw hundreds of pairs of expectant eyes.
　　"He's here! He's here!" Applause and cheers filled the entire space. The rain outside was still pouring down. At 7:35 PM, Minister Teng Daiyuan accompanied Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De into the room. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De smiled and nodded frequently to the representatives. Minister Teng introduced the heroes from the locomotives to him. Chairman Mao shook hands with Wu Zhongwen, a hero of the Youth locomotive, and asked him how old he was. Wu Zhongwen said that meeting Chairman Mao was like seeing his mother again eight years after he went out to beg for food at the age of nine. Li Yonggeng (a railway worker representative this time), an underground party member who had been fighting the Kuomintang reactionaries for a long time, was almost moved to tears due to excessive excitement. When Chairman Mao stepped onto the stage, the cheers in the hall ceased. In his speech, Chairman Mao earnestly told everyone to unite, rely on the masses to overcome difficulties, and build the railways better.
　　After Chairman Mao's speech, the worker representatives presented a flag to their most beloved leader. Li Yonggeng and Wu Zhongwen held the flag that said: "Chairman Mao, you are the lighthouse of China, you are the guiding star of the working class, we will always follow you!" Zhang Zhongye and Hu Tianmin held the flag that said: "Commander-in-Chief Zhu, you led the million-strong People's Liberation Army to eliminate the reactionaries and lay the foundation for the new China, we will never forget your achievements." and presented them to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De shook hands with them intimately.
　　After the flag presentation, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De walked down from the stage to meet the sixteen railway heroes one by one. The heroes did not leave him until a few minutes later. Guo Shude, the locomotive hero of the Mao Zedong locomotive, said: Chairman Mao came to see us in the rain and said a lot to us. We must step up our studies, learn his thoughts and style, and always maintain the glory of Mao Zedong. Zhang Zhongye, the hero of the 884 locomotive who traveled 110,000 kilometers, said that his father and younger brother were both Communist Party members. He would tell his red family what Chairman Mao said when he returned, so that they could start competitions with each other and always maintain the glory of heroes.

　　铁路工人英雄们
    与毛主席握了手
    “咱们今天可以见到毛主席了!”全国铁路职工的代表们，全国机务会议的代表们，在下午五点钟即冒滂沱大雨进入了会场，“怀仁堂”这个过去工人阶级根本不能进的帝王专制的宫殿，今天变成了工人阶级的会场。
    在周恩来同志结束他的讲话后，人们就纷纷议论着毛主席快来了。礼堂的东、西门口只要稍微有一点动静，几百双期待的眼睛就马上转向那里去了。
    “来了！来了！”掌声，欢呼声占领这里的整个空间，外面的雨依然如注的下着，七时三十五分，滕代远部长伴随着毛主席、朱总司令走进来，毛主席、朱总司令含笑的频频的向着代表们点头，滕部长给他介绍了机车上的英雄们，毛主席握着青年号机车英雄吴忠文的手问他多大了。吴忠文说他见到毛主席，与他九岁时出外要饭八年后又见到他母亲时候的心情一样。长期与国民党反动派作斗争的地下党员——李永赓（这次铁路职工代表），由于过度兴奋眼泪几乎要夺眶而出。当毛主席走上讲台时会场上才终止了欢呼声。毛主席在讲话中谆谆的告诉大家团结一起，依靠群众克服困难，把铁路建设得更好。
    在毛主席的讲话后，工人代表向自己最敬爱的领袖献旗，李永赓、吴忠文拿着那面：“毛主席你是中国的灯塔，你是工人阶级的指路明星，我们永远跟着你走！”张忠业与胡天民拿着那面：“朱总司令你率领百万人民解放大军，消灭反动派，奠定新中国的基础，我们永远不能忘记你的功绩。”的两面锦旗献给毛主席、朱总司令，毛主席和朱总司令同他们亲密地握手。
    献旗毕，毛主席、朱总司令从台上走下来与十六个铁路上的英雄一一相识，几分钟以后英雄们才离开他。毛泽东号的机车英雄郭树德表示：毛主席下着雨来看我们，向我们说了很多的话，我们一定加紧学习，学习他的思想与作风，永远的保持着毛泽东的光辉。行走十一万公里的八八四机车英雄张忠业说他的父亲、弟弟都是共产党员，他回去要将毛主席的话告诉他的红色家庭，来互相展开竞赛，永远保持着英雄的光荣。
