Worker Wang Yushu of the Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau's Locomotive Depot and others successfully researched a method to use copper to replace babbitt metal for locomotive crosshead slide blocks. According to Wang, he began researching this method before 1937 (Republic of China year 26). At that time, he tested a locomotive crosshead slide block (hereinafter referred to as "slide block") with copper plates inlaid at both ends, while the middle part still used babbitt metal. The test results showed that the middle babbitt metal was worn out and unusable, while the copper plates at both ends were still very thick. This uneven wear resulted in the failure of the method. During the Japanese occupation, the enemy also experimented with embedding three copper strips on a slide block, with the rest of the part still using babbitt metal, but this was also unsuccessful. After Zhangjiakou was liberated, Comrade Wang, based on past experience and with the assistance of seven workers, including Zhang Haishui, decided to completely replace the babbitt metal slide block with copper. The experiment began in January of this year, initially on locomotive No. ろ一一五二六. The left side was equipped with a babbitt metal slide block, and the right side was equipped with a copper slide block. After three months of operation, the babbitt metal slide block on the left side was replaced once, while the copper slide block on the right side still had 7 millimeters remaining and could still be used for another three months. During these three months of operation, the babbitt metal slide block on the left side wore down the crosshead bed surface by 1.5 millimeters, while the copper slide block on the right side only wore down by 0.9 millimeters. The test results proved that the copper slide block's efficiency increased by 100% compared to the babbitt metal slide block. Each jin (斤) used can save 1,050 yuan. In addition, Comrade Wang Yushu also transformed the locomotive cylinder babbitt metal piston head into a copper piston head. This method was successfully tested during the Kuomintang rule, but he was unwilling to announce it at that time. Now he introduces that the copper piston head has the following advantages over the babbitt metal piston head: 1. The babbitt metal piston head easily throws out the babbitt metal when the steam pressure is high, while the copper piston head does not have this phenomenon. 2. The babbitt metal piston head cannot be used when worn, while the copper piston head can still be used after being re-filed and drilled when worn. 3. The babbitt metal has a large expansion and contraction force, which can prevent leakage. Although the expansion and contraction force of copper is smaller, this defect can be overcome by making the interface tighter during production. 4. If the babbitt metal piston head leaks slightly, the leakage will become larger and larger, resulting in unusable. A slight leak in the copper piston head will not expand and can still be used. 5. The babbitt metal piston head can be used for a maximum of three months, while the copper piston head can be used for at least six months. Currently, most of the lower slide blocks of all 23 locomotives in the section have been replaced with copper slide blocks, and the upper slide blocks are also being gradually replaced. As for the copper piston heads, they were all replaced in April of this year. (Li Tianzhi et al.)

    工友王玉书发明：铜滑板代乌金
    张家口铁路局机务段工友王玉书等研究机车十字头滑板用铜代替乌金的方法成功。按王于民国二十六年前就开始研究此方法，当时曾试验过机车十字头滑板（以下简称滑板）两头镶铜板，中间仍用乌金，试验的结果，中间的乌金已磨耗不能使用，而两头铜板还很厚，这样因磨耗不平均，结果不能使用。日寇占领时期，敌人亦曾试验过在一块滑板上两头与中间镶三条铜板，其余的部分仍用乌金，结果亦未成功。张家口重获解放后，王同志根据过去的经验，再加上张海水等七位工友协助研究，最后决定完全用铜板代替乌金滑板，由本年一月份起开始试验，最初试用于ろ一一五二六号机车上：左侧装的是乌金滑板，右侧装的是铜滑板，经过三个月的行驶，左侧的乌金滑板更换了一次，而右侧的铜滑板还剩七公厘，仍能使用三个月。在此三个月的行驶期间，左侧的乌金滑板磨耗十字头床子面一·五公厘，而右侧铜滑板仅磨去○·九公厘。由于试验的结果，证明了铜滑板的使用效率比乌金滑板增加了一倍。每用一斤，并可节省人民币一千零五十元。另外王玉书同志又将机车汽缶乌金扒根改造为铜扒根，此方法早在国民党统治时就已试验成功，但那时他却不愿宣布，现在他介绍出铜扒根比乌金扒根有如下几点好处：一、乌金扒根遇汽压高时易将乌金甩出来，铜扒根则无此种现象；二、乌金扒根磨耗时不能使用，而铜扒根磨耗时，重行锉口、旋眼，仍能使用；三、乌金涨缩力大可防止泄漏，铜的涨缩力虽较小，但在制作时接口紧一点，亦能克服此种缺陷；四、乌金扒根稍有泄漏则愈漏愈大，结果不能使用。铜扒根稍有泄漏亦不致扩大，仍能使用；五、乌金扒根最多能使用三个月，铜扒根则最短能使用六个月。现该段所有的二十三台机车下滑板已大部改用铜滑板，上滑板亦正在逐步更换中。至于铜扒根已于本年四月份便已全部更换完了。（李天植等）
