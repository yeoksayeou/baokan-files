Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th: The Shanghai representatives commemorated the July 7th Incident and celebrated the liberation at a conference where three telegrams were passed, addressed to Chairman Mao, all democratic parties and people's organizations nationwide.

In the telegram to Chairman Mao and all democratic parties and people's organizations nationwide, it stated: The liberation of Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and the vast areas of Jiangnan has filled the six million people of Shanghai with joy and excitement. Now, the nationwide liberation is not far off, and we pledge to unite firmly around Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. Externally, we oppose U.S. imperialism's long-term occupation of Japan and its support for Japanese aggressive forces. We demand the swift signing of a peace treaty with Japan in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. We support the Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance, the socialist Soviet Union, and all new democratic countries, and join hands with all people worldwide who are fighting for democracy and peace to defend the world's democratic peace. Internally, we will do everything in our power to support the front lines and thoroughly and cleanly eliminate the remaining forces of the reactionaries. At the same time, to make Shanghai an industrialized production city, we must implement the policy of considering both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, assisting both urban and rural areas, and promoting internal and external exchange. In addition, we must eliminate lurking bandits and secret agents, restore and develop new cultural undertakings, and coordinate in all aspects to ensure the victorious completion of economic construction work, in order to welcome the upcoming New Political Consultative Conference and the soon-to-be-established People's Democratic United Government.

In the telegram to Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Deputy Commander Peng, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, it stated: With the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the long-tested People's Army, the Chinese people are invincible. We must actively support the People's Liberation Army, thoroughly liberate all of China, thoroughly expel the aggressive forces of imperialism, and eradicate the remaining forces of bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism. In the message of sympathy to the wounded and sick soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, it stated: All the people of Shanghai express their respect to you and extend their deep condolences. We hope that you will recuperate in peace, recover your health as soon as possible, so that you can return to the front lines and wipe out the remaining reactionary forces.
