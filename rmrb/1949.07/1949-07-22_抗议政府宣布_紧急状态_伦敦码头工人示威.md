　　Protesting the Government's Declaration of "State of Emergency"
  　London Dockworkers Demonstrate
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 21st: Reports from various sources indicate that on July 17th, over five thousand London dockworkers held a grand demonstration to protest the British government's declaration of a "state of emergency." Demonstrators, holding high the union flags, braved the pouring rain and marched seven miles from the London East End docks to Trafalgar Square, where they were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people. One hundred Canadian sailors were among their ranks. After the demonstrators arrived at Trafalgar Square, a mass protest rally of 15,000 people was held there. Representatives of the striking workers vehemently attacked the rumors against the dockworkers at the meeting. Timothy, of the Stevedores and Dockworkers Union, declared that dockworkers were willing to work on all ships except the two Canadian ships in dispute. He also said to cheers, "The Labour government is trying to starve us by the same methods used by the Conservatives, but we will never, at any time or place, be strike-breaking scabs." Speakers condemned the government for invoking emergency powers against the workers. They argued that the attack on the dockworkers was part of an overall offensive against the people's living standards and the working conditions of the British people. Mills, a Member of Parliament expelled from the Labour Party, spoke at the meeting, expressing his respect for the brave actions taken by British workers in defiance of their corrupt leaders who had betrayed them. Mills condemned "the government's actions as despicable" and condemned its "unwillingness to resolve the dispute." Thomas, a representative of the barge workers' union, said that no matter what force and persecution the government uses, the workers will continue their struggle. He said, "London dockworkers will never betray the labor movement." The protest rally read out telegrams of support for the London dockworkers from the World Federation of Trade Unions and several national trade unions, and the assembled masses expressed their gratitude with enthusiastic cheers for the increasing support given to the London dockworkers by workers around the world.

　　抗议政府宣布“紧急状态”
  　伦敦码头工人示威
    【新华社北平二十一日电】各方报道：七月十七日，五千多伦敦码头工人举行了盛大的示威游行，抗议英政府宣布“紧急状态”。高举工会旗帜的示威者，冒着倾盆大雨，自伦敦东部码头区步行七英里到特拉法加广场，沿途受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。他们的行列中有一百名加拿大水手。在示威者到达特拉法加广场以后，该地举行了一万五千人的群众抗议大会。罢工工人的代表，在会上猛烈攻击对码头工人的造谣。装卸工人与码头工人工会的第摩太宣称，除了争议中的两艘加拿大船以外，码头工人愿意在一切船只上工作。他又在欢呼声中说：“工党政府正企图以保守党所用过的同样方法饿死我们，但是，我们在任何时候任何地点都决不当破坏罢工的黑腿子。”演说者谴责政府引用紧急权力法案反对工人。他们力称，对码头工人的攻击，是对人民生活标准及英国人民的劳动条件的总攻势的一部分。被工党开除党籍的国会议员米尔斯在会上演说，对英国工人不顾叛变了他们的腐败的领袖而采取的勇敢行动表示敬意。米尔斯谴责“政府的行为是可鄙的”，并谴责它“不愿解决争议”。驳船工人工会的代表汤玛斯说，不管政府施用什么力量及迫害，工人将继续其斗争。他说，“伦敦码头工人决不背叛劳工运动”。抗议大会上宣读了世界工联与好几个国家工会对伦敦码头工人的声援电报，与会群众对全世界工人给伦敦码头工人的越来越多的支持以热烈欢呼表示感谢。
