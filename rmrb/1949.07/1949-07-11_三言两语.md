　　Short Remarks
    Thoroughly Investigate the Pangjiabao Mine
    The main mine of Longyan Iron Mine, Pangjiabao, has been damaged by a few lawless elements, and this has been going on for a year without effective handling. This is completely unacceptable. The damage to the Pangjiabao mine is a significant loss to the country and the people and should be taken very seriously. The truth of this matter should be thoroughly investigated, the responsible authorities held accountable, and the few evildoers punished according to the law. Furthermore, we must mobilize and educate the vast number of cadres and the people to cherish state property, and ensure that every piece of copper and iron is used in production. We must resolutely fight against all acts of sabotage and all bureaucratic phenomena that disregard the interests of the state and the people.
    Launch a Study Movement
    Since the publication of Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," personnel in various organizations in Beiping have been studying it earnestly. The current issue is that we must strengthen ideological and organizational leadership. The Study Committee of the North China People's Government has systematically organized this study movement, which is worthy of emulation. It is imperative that every cadre understands the epoch-making significance of this historical document, encourages everyone to open their minds and study hard diligently, and treats this study as a political task. Senior leading organs should take the lead, gain experience, and better assist other parts of North China to launch a wave of study.

　　三言两语
    澈查庞家堡矿场
    龙烟铁矿主要矿场庞家堡被少数不法分子所破坏，而且为时一载至今尚未有效处理，这是完全不应该的。庞家堡采矿场的被损坏，是国家和人民的重大损失，应当引起我们严重重视，彻底清查这一事情的真相，追究有关机关的责任，依法征办少数为非作恶的坏分子，并发动与教育广大干部和人民爱护国家的财产，把一块铜一片铁都用到生产中去，坚决同一切破坏行为，同一切漠祝国家人民利益的官僚主义现象作斗争。
    掀起一个学习运动
    毛主席“论人民民主专政”发表后，在平各机关人员都在认真学习，现在的问题是必须加强思想领导和组织领导，华北人民政府学委会有计划有步骤地组织这一学习运动，是值得效法的。必须让每一个干部了解这一历史文献划时代的重大意义，启发大家打开脑筋认真苦学，要把这一学习当作一个政治任务去作。高级领导机关要首先作起，取得经验，以便更好帮助华北其他各地，掀起一个学习热潮。
