　　Fur Company Supports Zhangjiakou Fur Industry
    [Chahar News] In order to activate capital, absorb and support agricultural and sideline production, enable the North China Foreign Trade Company to organize exports in a timely manner, and avoid losses during the rainy season, the Chahar Provincial Trade Company organized the transportation of export goods to Tianjin in June. This included 10,120,252 jin of sesame, rapeseed, and soybeans; 285,000 jin of wool; 4,189 jin of camel hair; 9,171 jin of bristles; 20,893 jin of asbestos; 12,666 jin of apricot kernels; and approximately 20,000 jin of medicinal materials, totaling 10,472,165 jin, with a total value of 600 million yuan. (Liu Yi)
    [Another News] The fur trade in Zhangjiakou has been stagnant since last winter. In order to support the production of the fur industry in Zhangjiakou, the Chahar Provincial Fur Company purchased approximately 2,000 pieces of raw and cooked fur products from various fur shops in Zhangjiakou at reasonable prices in mid-June, so that the capital of each fur business could circulate. In a spirit of support, it sold more than 1,800 pieces of fur rugs and fur tubes to the Quan Shun Xing Fur Shop in Beiping for shipment to Shanghai. The first batch of goods departed from Zhangjiakou on July 10. The Fur Company also sent personnel to Shanghai to understand the situation and open up sales channels. It is estimated that the fur industry in Zhangjiakou will become active in the future. (Wang Xiaotian)
