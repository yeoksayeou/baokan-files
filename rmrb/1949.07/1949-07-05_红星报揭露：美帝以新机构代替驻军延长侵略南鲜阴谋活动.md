　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: Moscow dispatch: The Red Star newspaper published an article on June 30th entitled "American Expansionists are Prolonging the Occupation of South Korea," exposing that the so-called withdrawal of American troops from South Korea recently clamored about by the United States is merely a new way to prolong the occupation of South Korea. The Red Star newspaper pointed out that long before the so-called withdrawal, the U.S. authorities had made many preparations and established many new institutions of the U.S. occupation forces. These institutions are now replacing the headquarters of the U.S. occupation forces and conducting activities in South Korea. In commenting on the extension of the U.S. occupation of South Korea, the Red Star newspaper pointed out: The Soviet army liberated Korea from the colonial enslavement of Japanese bandits for many years. After fulfilling its great mission of liberation, the Soviet army withdrew from Korea long ago. However, the U.S. army only arrived in South Korea three weeks after the defeat of the Japanese army, but they are still there. The Red Star newspaper stated: The issue of the U.S. military withdrawing from South Korea is an old issue. At the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea, and at the second and third sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union repeatedly insisted on the proposal that the U.S. and Soviet troops withdraw from Korea simultaneously and insisted on giving the Korean people the possibility of organizing a democratic government. The Soviet government's proposal fully conformed to the national interests and long-cherished wishes of the Korean people, so it received enthusiastic support in Korea. The newspaper stated that when pointing out the United States refused to adopt the Soviet proposals: Therefore, there are two lines on the Korean issue: one is the line pursued by the United States, which uses troops to ensure the possibility of establishing a "government" that suits the interests of the U.S. ruling group; the other is the line implemented by the Soviet Union, which advocates the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea to ensure the free realization of the will of the Korean people.

　　红星报揭露：美帝以新机构代替驻军延长侵略南鲜阴谋活动
    【新华社北平三日电】莫斯科讯：红星报于六月三十日发表“美国扩张主义者正延长对南朝鲜的占领”一文，揭露美国近来所喧嚷的所谓美军自南朝鲜的撤退，只是以新的方式延长对南朝鲜的占领。红星报指出，早在所谓撤退之前，美国当局便做了许多准备工作，成立了许多新的美国占领军机构。这些机构，目前便代替了美国占领军总部，在南朝鲜进行活动。红星报在评论美军延长占领南朝鲜时指出：苏军把朝鲜从日寇多年殖民奴役下解放出来。苏军在执行了其伟大的解放使命后，很久以前，即撤离朝鲜；而美军仅在日本军队溃败后三星期才到达南朝鲜，但他们迄今仍留在那里。红星报称：美军自南朝鲜撤退的问题，已是一个老问题了。在美苏对朝鲜联合委员会上，及第二届、第三届联合国大会上，苏联一再坚主美苏两国军队同时从朝鲜撤退的建议，并坚持给朝鲜人民组织民主政府的可能性。苏联政府的建议完全符合朝鲜人民的民族利益及其夙愿，所以在朝鲜受到热烈的支持。该报在指出美国拒绝采取苏联的建议时称：因此在朝鲜问题上存在着两条路线：一条是美国所奉行的路线，它利用驻军，来保证成立适合于美国统治集团利益的“政府”的可能性；另一条是苏联所实行的路线，主张全部外国军队自朝鲜撤退，以保证朝鲜人民的意志自由实现。
