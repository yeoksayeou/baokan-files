[Ping City News] The North China People's Government recently made several regulations on market management and material exchange, and ordered governments at all levels to comply on July 5. The original order is as follows:

At present, in some areas of North China, market management is improper, and material exchange is greatly hindered. For example, some places implement permit management for grain and cotton, prohibiting free trade. Some places, under the pretext of price fluctuations, prohibit the flow of grain into cities or to neighboring areas. These phenomena are harmful to the exchange of urban and rural materials and the development of industrial and agricultural production. In order to overcome the above phenomena, the following regulations are made:

(1) Intra-regional trade in North China should develop material exchange based on the principle of free trade. Without the permission of the North China People's Government, local administrative organs shall not implement measures such as restricting or prohibiting transportation, which are harmful to material exchange.

(2) The main tasks of grain, yarn, and general merchandise exchanges in various cities are to facilitate transactions between merchants and to oppose speculation and manipulation. Illegal activities such as manipulation and monopoly, hoarding and speculation, and buying and selling short (the clear definition of these illegal activities will be explained in a separate document) should be prohibited, but all legitimate transactions must be encouraged.

(3) At present, the currency in the entire region has been unified. Any change in prices is a regional problem, not a problem that can be solved by one region alone. Therefore, when prices fluctuate, the task of market administration is mainly to cooperate with financial and trade organs to appropriately regulate supply and demand and prevent panic buying and selling, so as to avoid the occurrence of sharp rises and falls. However, it should not be attempted to create a disruption of material flow, which may seem beneficial from a local perspective, but is very harmful from a global perspective. Not only will it fail to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices, but it may also stimulate continued price fluctuations, which will in turn affect local areas.

(4) Factories purchasing raw materials and import and export merchants purchasing export goods should be given as much assistance as possible (such as local supply and marketing cooperatives being able to purchase or sell large quantities of raw materials and processed products on behalf of their members, to avoid intermediate exploitation, which would be even better), so that they can supply the needs of cities and exports in large quantities. Assistance should also be given to the promotion of industrial products to promote industrial production.

(5) The North China Region and the friendly neighboring liberated areas have become one, and trade is becoming more frequent. Except for tobacco and alcohol, which are temporarily not allowed to circulate with each other, all other materials should be allowed to circulate with each other and should not be obstructed. As for the procurement of public organs between the North China Region and the friendly neighboring liberated areas, the principle of not setting up stalls with each other should still be followed, and it should be carried out through the trade organs of the neighboring areas.

　　华北人民政府规定办法通令执行
    鼓励市场正当交易  发展城乡物资交流
    【平市讯】华北人民政府顷对市场管理与物资交流做出几点规定，于七月五日令各级政府遵行，原令如下：
    目前华北有些地区，对市场管理不当，对物资交流阻碍很大，例如有些地方对粮棉实施证照管理，禁止自由贩运。有些地方借口物价波动，禁止粮食流入城市或运往邻区。这些现象对于交流城乡物资发展工农生产是有害的。为了克服上述这些现象，特作以下规定：
    （一）华北区内地贸易，应根据自由贸易原则，发展物资交流，各地行政机关未经华北人民政府许可，不得实行限运禁运等有害物资交流之措施。
    （二）各城市粮食、纱布、百货交易所的主要任务是为了便利商民成交，反对投机操纵。对于操纵垄断、囤积倒把、买空卖空等非法行为（这些非法行为的明确界说另文解释），应予禁止，但对于一切正当交易则必须予以鼓励。
    （三）目前全区货币已经统一，物价的任何变动，都是全区性的问题，而不是一个地区所能单独解决的问题。因此在物价波动时，市场行政管理的任务，主要是配合金融贸易机关，适当调节供求，防止争购争售，以免发生暴涨暴跌的现象。但不应企图造成物资断流，从局部看，似属有利，从全局看，则十分有害，不仅不能达到平稳物价之目的，反而可能刺激物价继续波动，返回来仍会影响到局部地区。
    （四）对工厂采购原料，及进出口商人采购出口物资，应尽可能的给以帮助（如各地供销合作社能自行采购或代社员出售大批原料品加工品，避免中间剥削则更好），使能大量供应城市与出口之需要，对工业品之推销，亦应予以协助，以促进工业生产。
    （五）华北区与各友邻解放区已经连成一片，贸易往来日益频繁，除烟酒已规定暂时互不流通外，其他一切物资应准许互相流通，不得阻碍。至于华北区与友邻解放区间公营机关之采购，仍本互不设摊原则，通过邻区贸易机关进行。
