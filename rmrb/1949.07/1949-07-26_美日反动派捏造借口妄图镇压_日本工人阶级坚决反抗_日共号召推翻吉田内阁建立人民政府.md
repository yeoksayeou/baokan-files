Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 25th—Reports from various sources: The reactionary Yoshida government, under the direct instigation of the American occupiers, has recently taken a series of frenzied suppressive actions against the Japanese working class and its vanguard, the Japanese Communist Party, in an attempt to subdue the Japanese working class's resistance to the government's mass layoff plans. On July 13, sixteen railway workers in Suita City, near Osaka, were arrested for participating in demonstrations against layoffs. On July 18, the state-owned railway company, in violation of the Civil Service Law regarding not dismissing employees for participating in trade union activities, announced the dismissal of seventeen left-wing members of the Central Struggle Committee of the National Railway Workers' Union, including Suzuki Ichiku, the vice-chairman of the National Railway Workers' Union, in an attempt to break up the leading organ of the Japanese National Railway workers' struggle. On July 20, the Fukushima District Court issued arrest warrants for ten executive members of the Railway Workers' Union branch in Fukushima, who had led Fukushima railway workers in opposing layoffs and had clashed with the railway bureau. On the same day, armed police in Taira Port arrested eighteen mining leaders who had led miners in resisting police provocations and had once occupied the Taira Port police station. The Yoshida government also fabricated the train derailment incident at Mikata Station in Tokyo, widely publicizing it as "Communist Party sabotage" in order to directly suppress the Japanese Communist Party. After an empty train at Mikata Station suddenly "automatically" moved and killed six people on the evening of the 15th, the Tokyo Police Department immediately ordered the arrest of Communist Party members Iizuka Ichiro and Yamamoto Kyuichi. On the 20th, the Osaka Police Department, claiming that the wall newspaper published by the local party committee of the Japanese Communist Party carried news of the rape of a Japanese girl in Tsuruga Port, which was an "insult" to the occupying forces, raided the Osaka Communist Party headquarters and arrested twelve Communist Party members, threatening to try them on charges of "obstructing the Allied occupation." On the 21st and 22nd, the Osaka police continued to search and arrest, and by the 23rd, the number of arrested Communist Party members and progressive elements had reached sixty-one.
	These frantic actions by the Yoshida government have aroused resolute resistance from the Japanese working class. Demonstrations and work slowdowns are constantly occurring. After the National Railway Company issued the "dismissal" notice to seventeen union leaders, Suzuki Ichiku and others immediately declared their refusal to accept the layoff notice, announcing that they would continue to fight for the free rights of the union. The Political Bureau of the Japanese Communist Party also issued a statement on the 20th, denouncing the reactionary Yoshida government for imitating the Nazi Reichstag fire case by fabricating the recent train derailment incident and the assassination of Shimoyama, president of the National Railway Corporation, as excuses to suppress the Communist Party. The JCP statement called on the Japanese people to rise up, expose, and overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet and establish a people's government.

　　美日反动派捏造借口妄图镇压
  　日本工人阶级坚决反抗
    日共号召推翻吉田内阁建立人民政府
    【新华社北平二十五日电】各方报道：反动的吉田政府在美国占领者的直接指使下，最近对日本工人阶级及其先锋队——日本共产党采取了一系列疯狂的镇压行动，以图压服日本工人阶级对政府大量裁员计划的反抗。七月十三日大坂附近水田城的十六名铁道工人，因曾参加反对裁员的示威而被捕。七月十八日，国营铁道会社违反公务员法关于不得因参加职工运动而开除职工的规定，宣布裁退国营铁道工会中央斗争委员会的左翼委员十七名，包括国营铁道工会副主席铃木市蒯在内，企图借以打散领导日本国营铁道工人斗争的首脑机关。七月二十日，福岛市地方法院发出拘票，逮捕曾领导福岛铁道工人反对裁员并与路局发生冲突的铁道工会分会干事十名。同日，平港的武装警察逮捕了曾领导矿工反抗警察挑衅并一度占领平港警察局的矿工领袖十八名。吉田政府同时还制造了东京见高车火车出轨事件，大肆宣传这是“共产党的破坏”，以便直接镇压日本共产党。在见高车站一列空无一人的火车忽然于十五日晚“自动”行驶并撞死六人后，东京警察局立即下令逮捕共产党员饭冢一郎与山本球一两人。二十日，大坂警察局又以日共地方党部所出版的墙报刊载敦贺港发生日本少女被强奸的新闻是“侮辱”占领军，大举搜捕大坂共产党党部，捕去共产党员十二人，扬言将以“妨碍盟国占领”的罪名，审讯他们。二十一、二十二两日，大坂警察继续搜捕，至二十三日，被捕的共产党员及进步分子已达六十一人。
    吉田政府的这些疯狂行动，引起了日本工人阶级的坚决反抗。示威，怠工事件不断发生。在国营铁道会社发出“裁退”十七名工会领袖的通知后，铃木市蒯等立即声明拒绝接受裁员通知，宣布他们将继续为职工会的自由权利而斗争。日本共产党政治局亦于二十日发表声明，斥责吉田反动政府仿效纳粹国会纵火案的方法，制造最近的火车出轨事件及谋杀国营铁道会社总裁下山案件，作为镇压共产党的借口。日共声明号召日本人民起来揭发与推翻吉田内阁，建立人民的政府。
