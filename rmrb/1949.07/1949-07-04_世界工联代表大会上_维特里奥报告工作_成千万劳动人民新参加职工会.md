　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 2nd: TASS, Milan—Vittorio, acting chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and general secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, addressed the opening of the WFTU Second Congress on June 29th, congratulating the congress on behalf of the Italian General Confederation of Labor and all the laboring people of Italy.

　　Vittorio declared that the WFTU was born in the context of growing international solidarity, uniting 65 million organized laboring people in 52 countries. The WFTU's outstanding achievement is that, for the first time in history, it has united such a vast mass of laboring people, including all races and continents, within one organization.

　　The WFTU emerged as a vivid expression of a new historical stage. This new historical stage began with the victory of the peoples of various countries over Fascism. Its characteristic is that the struggle of trade unions and the struggle for human progress have gained the participation of a new group of laboring people. These tens of millions of laboring people are united closely and sincerely to ensure higher living standards, prevent the revival of Fascism, and save humanity from new massacres. The WFTU has always and will always hold high the banner of fighting for the welfare of the laboring people of the world, social progress, national independence, and peace.

　　Vittorio then briefly outlined the work of the WFTU in its three and a half years of existence. The WFTU has helped the laboring people of several countries, first and foremost the people of colonial countries, as well as the suffering masses of Fascist Spain and Royalist Fascist Greece, who have been subjected to cruel exploitation and ruthless oppression. The WFTU has used all means of expressing its will in the world to resolutely oppose persecution and expose all the crimes of Fascist governments, thereby successfully rescuing more than one leader of the working class and trade unions. The WFTU has supported the struggles of laboring people around the world for economic and social demands. In some countries, laboring people often make various efforts to achieve a considerable improvement in living standards.

　　Vittorio further pointed out that the reactionary wave against the working class and the trade union movement has swept through almost all capitalist countries. The purpose of this reactionary wave is to undermine trade union rights and the democratic freedoms of the laboring people, and to deprive the laboring people of the legitimate means to express their will for peace.

　　Vittorio added that there are factors in the world that no one can hide from the laboring people. In terms of its strength, this factor is superior to all atomic bombs and all secret weapons. This factor lies in the fact that only in the Soviet Union and other countries that have overthrown capitalism are there no crises, depressions, or unemployment. Only in these countries does production steadily increase, and at the same time, the material and cultural well-being of the laboring masses steadily improves.

　　Vittorio emphasized that the most important task facing trade unions is to consolidate their ranks and organize powerful struggles to fight for the daily bread of the laboring people, improve their living standards, maintain their trade unions and democratic fruits, and the greatest ideal of mankind – peace.

　　In conclusion, Vittorio denounced the shameless people who split the unity of the international trade union movement, expressing his belief that the congress will strengthen the unity of the trade union ranks and prove that the trust placed in the WFTU by hundreds of millions of laboring people is justified.

　　世界工联代表大会上
    维特里奥报告工作
  　成千万劳动人民新参加职工会
    【新华社北平二日电】塔斯社米兰讯：世界工联代理主席、意大利总工会总书记维特里奥，六月二十九日在世界工联第二届代表大会开幕时致词，代表意大利总工会与意大利全体劳动人民向大会致贺。
    维特里奥宣称：世界工联是在日益增长的国际团结的情况下产生的，它团结着五十二个国家的六千五百万有组织的劳动人民。世界工联的卓越的功绩，就是它在历史上第一次把如此广大的、包括一切种族与各大洲的劳动人民群众，团结在一个组织里面。
    世界工联是以作为新的历史阶段底生动表现而出现的。这一新的历史阶段，始于各国人民对法西斯主义的胜利，其特点是：职工会的斗争，争取人类进步的斗争，得到了新的一批劳动人民的参加，这一批数以千万计的劳动人民，怀着真诚的愿望，紧密无间地团结起来，以确保较高的生活标准，防止法西斯主义的复活与拯救人类免于新的屠杀。世界工联曾经而且将始终高举着为全世界劳动人民底福利、社会进步、民族独立与和平而斗争的旗帜。
    维特里奥继而简要地概述世界工联在其存在的三年半中的工作。世界工联帮助了若干国家的劳动人民，首先是殖民地国家的人民，以及受到残酷的剥削与无情的压迫的法西斯西班牙和保皇法西斯希腊的劳苦群众。世界工联用尽世界上一切表达意志的方法，来坚决反对迫害，并揭露法西斯政府的一切罪行，从而胜利地营救了不只一个工人阶级与职工会的领袖。世界工联支持了全世界各地劳动人民为经济与社会要求而进行的斗争，在某些国家，劳动人民常常作种种的努力，以求生活标准获得相当的改善。
    维特里奥进而指出：反工人阶级及职工运动的反动浪潮，已几乎席卷了一切资本主义国家。这种反动浪潮的目的，在于破坏职工会权利和劳动人民的民主自由，剥夺劳动人民用以表示其争取和平意志的合法手段。
    维特里奥又称：世界上存在着任何人都不能向劳动人民隐瞒的因素。就其力量来说，这个因素优越于一切的原子弹和一切秘密武器。这个因素在于：只有在苏联及其他推翻了资本主义的国家，才没有危机、萧条或失业。只有在这些国家中，生产才稳步地增加，同时，劳动群众的物质与文化福利也稳步地增进着。
    维特里奥强调指出：职工会面前最重要的任务，便是紧密他们的队伍，并以争取劳动人民的每日食粮组织强有力的斗争，提高他们的生活水平，保持他们的职工会和民主果实与人类最伟大的理想——和平。
    维特里奥在结语中斥责分裂国际职工会团结的无耻之徒，表示相信代表大会将加强职工会队伍的团结，并证明千百万劳动人民对世界工联所寄予的信任是正确的。
