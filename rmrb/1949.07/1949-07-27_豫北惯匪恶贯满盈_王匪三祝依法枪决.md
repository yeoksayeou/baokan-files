[Taihang Telegram] Wang Sanzhu, a habitual bandit from northern Henan captured during the liberation of Anyang, was approved by the North China People's Government. Subsequently, a people's court jointly organized by the Taihang and Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Offices conducted a public trial in Xinxiang on the 15th of this month and immediately sentenced him to execution by firing squad according to the law. More than ten thousand people attended the meeting that day. At the beginning of the meeting, the chief prosecutor filed charges, followed by victims from the area who accused him of his crimes. Bandit Wang was from Weinan County (old Hua County, Henan), and is 29 years old. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, this bandit colluded with Japanese and puppet forces to sabotage the war of resistance. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, he intensified his trampling on the people of northern Henan, serving as the vanguard of Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist and anti-people activities. Wherever he went, he burned, killed, raped, and plundered, committing heinous atrocities. The cruel methods of killing people numbered no less than dozens, the most brutal being cutting open the abdomen and digging out the heart, live flaying, disemboweling to take infants, boiling alive, collective burning, etc. According to incomplete statistics from Weinan and Yanjin counties alone, more than 1,040 people were killed by Bandit Wang. Our democratic government, adhering to the policy of punishing the principal culprits and not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding those who performed meritorious service, pronounced the death penalty on Bandit Wang on the 15th and executed him. The local people were pleased with the democratic government's maintenance of the rule of law and the resolute suppression of heinous criminals.
