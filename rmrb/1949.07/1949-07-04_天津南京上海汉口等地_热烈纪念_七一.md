Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd -- Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou and other places warmly commemorated "July 1st" yesterday. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of party member cadres. Huang Songling, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, reported on the history of the Communist Party of China at the meeting. Huang Min, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, reviewed the achievements and shortcomings in Tianjin's work at the meeting. He pointed out that many shortcomings had occurred in handling labor-capital relations, because of insufficient understanding of China's economic situation, and a lack of deep understanding that in addition to developing state-owned industries, attention must be paid to the development of urban and rural private economies. He called on everyone to work hard to learn how to do economic work well. Many factories and schools in Tianjin held meetings to commemorate the event, and dispatched Yangko teams, propaganda trucks, etc. to promote the event to the public. Employees of the Tianjin Trolleybus Management Office rushed to repair the "July 1st" trolleybus as a gift to "July 1st". All agencies, schools, factories, and shops in Nanjing were decorated with lights and colors to commemorate the event. Employees of the wired radio factory, wireless radio factory, water plant, Nanjing factory of China Agricultural Machinery Company, repair shop, and 401 automobile repair shop held commemorative meetings. Employees of Nanjing Station on the Jinghu Railway and the China Merchants Bureau specially repaired the station and navigation lights along the Yangtze River on "July 1st" to restore their brilliance. The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a gathering of all party members in Nanjing to celebrate. Song Renqiong, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and democratic personage Liang Xi, among others, spoke at the meeting. Song Renqiong called on all party members in the city to be cautious and prudent, not arrogant or impetuous, to promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, to maintain close ties with the masses, and to accelerate the arrival of national victory and the construction of a new Nanjing. The preparatory committee of the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and more than 500 worker representatives from the city went to Yuhuatai on the eve of July 1st to mourn the Communist Party members, workers and other patriotic and democratic people who had been killed there by the Kuomintang bandits over the years. The family members of the martyrs indignantly denounced the crimes of the Kuomintang bandits in massacring the martyrs. Lu Guohua, a relative of a martyr, said: The grievances of the past nineteen years have been redressed today, but the road of revolution has only just begun. We must bury our heads in our work to commemorate the martyrs. The Shanghai Garrison Forces and the employees of various factories held separate meetings to commemorate the event. Representatives from various party, government, and military agencies and people's organizations also gathered to form the Shanghai Preparatory Committee for Commemorating "July 7th" and Celebrating Liberation.
