　　Japanese National Industry on the Verge of Bankruptcy, Yoshida Government Betrays Promises to Serve Monopoly Capital
    --Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party
    (Note: This article is an excerpt from the interpellation speech given by Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, in the Japanese Diet on April 5th this year. The original text was published in the Akahata on April 7th.)
    (1) On Trade
    In my interpellation speech last November, I mentioned that unequal exchange in trade benefits foreign capital and enslaves our nation. The current cabinet has strengthened this policy. Import prices have risen to more than three times the domestic official prices. Most shockingly, the import price of coal is about nine times the price the government sells to steel companies. However, exports are sold at prices much lower than international prices. For example, rayon is only slightly less than one-half of the international price, and ceramics are only one-quarter of the international price. Therefore, by the end of the 1949 fiscal year (i.e., by March 31st of this year), the import surplus had risen to 1.23 billion US dollars, which is equivalent to 405.9 billion yen at the rate of 330 yen per US dollar. Such trade, suffering double losses in both exports and imports, is gradually depleting the nation's wealth. Regarding this issue, our party advocates free trade, state-run trade, and people's management, promoting independent and autonomous trade with the Soviet Union, the Chinese Communist Party, North Korea, and other areas in the Far East. For this purpose, it is necessary to promote the early conclusion of a peace treaty.
    (2) Monopoly Capital Concentrates Industry to Strengthen Exports
    Due to the great foreign demand for steel, the Yoshida cabinet's policy specifically focuses on this as the center of economic revival. Steel production is concentrated in three major companies: Nippon Steel, Nippon Kokan, and Nakayama Steel Works. Their production has increased threefold, while other companies are on the verge of bankruptcy. The mass layoffs at Nagoya Daido Steel can illustrate this. Shipbuilding is concentrated in Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, Mitsui, and Uraga Dock, which hardly manufacture ships for Japan's own use. Textile machinery is concentrated in five major companies, including Toyota and Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, with products entirely for export. Bicycles are concentrated in three companies: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Miyata, and Okamoto, with products almost entirely for export. Aluminum production is concentrated in three major companies: Showa Denko, Nisshin Chemical, and Nippon Light Metal, with most of their products also for export.
    (3) Price Policy Designed for Monopoly Capital
    Price policy is also designed for the benefit of monopoly capital. The prices of products from monopoly enterprises are very high, while the prices of products from small and medium-sized enterprises and agriculture and fisheries are extremely low. Comparing the various commodity prices revised in July of last year with those in 1936, the following shocking figures are revealed: the prices of general agricultural products have increased 60 to 90 times, rice 133 times, while the price of ammonium sulfate (the main raw material for manufacturing chemical fertilizers - translator) has increased 260 times, coal 317 times, and pig iron 462 times. From this, it can be seen that the Yoshida government cruelly exploits the people to support monopoly capital, while small and medium-sized capital cannot avoid destruction.
    (4) Tax Policy that Impoverishes the People and Benefits Monopoly Capitalists and Big Black Market Merchants
    In this year's budget, tax revenue is twice that of last year, but corporate tax (referring to company tax - translator) accounts for only 3.6 percent, with the majority borne by small and medium-sized enterprises. The Democratic Liberal Party promised to reduce income tax, but in fact, income tax has increased by 70 percent compared to last year. Big capitalists and big black market merchants use the deceptive method of claiming "deficits" to evade paying huge amounts of taxes. Therefore, the taxation on the people has actually increased more than twofold. The taxation on farmers has increased sharply, and its proportion to farmers' total income was 5 percent in 1936, increasing to 56 percent in 1948 and about 80 percent in 1949. This makes it impossible for farmers to live. The government, in order to make up for deficits, is said to be planning to tax non-profit corporations. This means taxing labor unions, farmers' associations, and other democratic organizations, which shows fascist dictatorship.
    The Japanese Communist Party thoroughly opposes this monopoly capital-oriented policy, that is, the policy of concentrating capital and resources for monopoly capital, and opposes the rampant activities of big black market merchants. We demand the abolition of bureaucratic rule, the establishment of price controls that serve the people, the immediate abolition of mass taxation, the collection of huge amounts of taxes evaded by big capitalists and big black market merchants, and the establishment of a highly progressive income tax. In this way, prices will fall by one-third, and people's purchasing power can be increased fourfold. Important industries of monopoly capital should be transferred to state ownership and managed by the people, so as to prevent tax evasion. Only in this way can the Japanese economy turn from an abnormal state to a normal state, and move towards true stability.
    (5) Establishing the Ruling Power of Financial Capital
    Up to now, the government has abandoned the state's control over financial power, abolished the Industrial Reconstruction Finance Bank, and stopped issuing public and local bonds, with past issues being prepared for repayment. As a result, financial power is concentrated in nine major private banks. In the past, industry, agriculture, and fisheries were all dominated by bureaucratic control. In order to control these bureaucratic controls, financial capital established the economic dominance of private banks and strengthened their political rule at the same time. The Yoshida cabinet's policy aims at the combination of private large banks and foreign monopoly capital, which will inevitably make our nation a vassal of foreign capital.
    Our party's policy is to overthrow financial capital. Only by transferring finance to state ownership and managing it by the people, so that it serves workers, farmers, fishermen, small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants, and national capital, can we restore an economy that is beneficial to the people.
    (6) The Neglect of State-Owned Enterprises and National Enterprises and the Tragedy of Introducing Foreign Capital
    According to statistics, 52 stations, 36 tunnels, 30 bridges, and 374 lines of the state-owned railways are extremely dangerous due to disrepair. Compared with 1936, the number of railway accidents has increased 2.67 times for line accidents and nearly 29 times for vehicle accidents. It is estimated that the number of major accidents occurring on the lines now is about ten times that of 1936. The phenomenon of neglect in the telephone and telegraph business is even more serious. What is burned cannot be restored.
    The Democratic Liberal Party has begun a movement to sell off the state-owned railways on the grounds of neglect, and as a result, the state-owned railways will be bought by foreign capital. Currently, Mobil Oil has controlled the port facilities in Wakayama of Teikoku Oil and Toa Fuel, which is under its control. Texaco has investments in Nippon Oil and controls the Tsurumi Oil Refinery. Fifty-one percent of the shares of these companies are owned by foreign capital. Even the Wang Jingwei puppet government in China in the past did not do this.
    Our party's policy is to oppose the introduction of foreign capital that enslaves the people. The use of foreign capital should be carried out under the condition that trade is operated by the state and managed by the people, so as to develop trade that is beneficial to the people.
                                                                                                (To be continued)

### 日本民族工业濒于破产，吉田政府背弃诺言为独占资本服务——日本共产党总书记德田球一

　　日本民族工业濒于破产，吉田政府背弃诺言为独占资本服务
    ——日本共产党总书记德田球一
    （按：本文为日共总书记德田球一今年四月五日在日本议会中的质问演说的节译，原文载于四月七日赤旗报。）
    （一）关于贸易
    我在去年十一月的质问演说中，曾提到贸易的不等价交换，有利于外国资本，而使我们民族奴隶化。本届内阁更加强了这一政策。输入价格已升至国内公定价格的三倍以上。最惊人的是煤的输入价格，约为政府卖给制铁公司价格的九倍。但输出品却以远较国际价格为低的廉价出卖。如人造丝仅合国际价格二分之一弱，陶器仅合国际价格四分之一。因此，至一九四九会计年度末（按即至今年三月三十一日止），入超已升至十二亿三千万美元，以每美元合三百三十圆（日圆，下同）计，共合四千零五十九亿圆。象这样在输出、输入方面遭受双重损失的贸易，使国家财富日益枯竭。对于这个问题，我党主张贸易自由，贸易国营，并由人民管理，促进与苏联、中国共产党、北朝鲜及其他远东一带的独立自主的贸易。为此，有促进早日缔结和约的必要。
    （二）独占资本为加强输出而集中产业
    由于外国对于钢铁需要甚大，因此吉田内阁的政策特别以此作为经济复兴的中心。钢铁的生产集中于日铁、日本钢管、中山制钢等三家大公司。它们的生产增加三倍，而其他公司则濒于破产。名古屋大同制铁公司的大量裁员，即可说明此事。造船集中于三菱、川崎、三井、浦贺船坞，它们几乎不制造日本自用的船只。纺织机械集中于丰田、丰和等五大公司，产品完全为了输出。自行车集中于三菱重工业、宫田、冈本等三家公司，产品差不多完全为了输出。铝的生产集中于昭和电工、日新化学、日本轻合金等三大公司，产品也是大部分为了输出。
    （三）为独占资本打算的价格政策
    价格政策也是为独占资本的利益着想。独占企业的产品，价格很高，中小企业及农渔业产品的价格则极贱，以去年七月改订的各种物价与一九三六年相比，则表示了下述惊人的数字：一般农产品价格增加六十倍至九十倍，米一百三十三倍，而硫安（制造化学肥料的主要原料——译者）价格却增加二百六十倍，石炭三百十七倍，铣铁四百六十二倍。由此可见，吉田政府残酷地剥削人民以供养独占资本，而中小资本则不能不走向毁灭。
    （四）使人民濒于死亡，使独占资本家及大黑市商得利的课税政策
    在本年度的预算中，税收为去年的二倍，其中法人税（指公司税——译者）仅占百分之三点六，大部分是由中小企业负担，民主自由党曾答应减轻所得税，但事实上与去年相较，所得税却增加百分之七十。大资本家、大黑市商用借口“亏空”的欺骗办法，逃脱缴纳巨额的税款。因此向人民的课税，实际增加了二倍以上。对于农民的课税，急剧地增加，其与农民总收入的比例，一九三六年为百分之五，一九四八年增至百分之五十六，一九四九年增至百分之八十左右。这样，使得农民无法生活下去。政府为了弥补亏空，据说又要向非财团法人课税。这就是说，要向工会，农会及其他民主团体课税，这显示了法西斯的独裁。
    日本共产党彻底反对这种独占资本的本位政策，即是反对为独占资本而集中资本与资材的政策，反对大黑市商的横行。我们要求废除官僚统治，建立为人民服务的价格管制，即刻废止大众课税，征收大资本家，大黑市商逃避的巨额税收，设立高度累进所得税。这样，物价将下降三分之一，人民购买力可提高四倍。独占资本的重要产业应移归国营，由人民进行管理，这样才可防止漏税。这样日本经济才能由不正常态度转向正常状态，才能走向真正的安定。
    （五）确立金融资本的统治权
    迄今为止，政府放弃了国家掌握的金融支配权，废除产业复兴金库，停止发行公债和地方债，过去发行的准备偿还。结果，金融权力集中于九大私营银行。过去产业、农业、渔业都被官僚统制所支配，金融资本为了支配这些官僚统制，便确立了私营银行的经济支配力，同时加强其在政治上的统治。吉田内阁这种政策，是以私营大银行与外国独占资本的结合为目的，这必然使我们民族成为外国资本的附庸。
    我党的政策是主张打倒金融资本，只有将金融交归国营并由人民管理，使其为工、农、渔夫、中小工商业、民族资本等服务，才能恢复有利于人民的经济。
    （六）国家企业与民族企业的荒废和引进外资的悲剧
    根据统计，国营铁道因年久失修而极其危险者有车站五十二处，隧道三十六处，桥梁三十处，线路三百七十四处。铁路出事次数，一九四六年与一九三六年比较，线路出事增加二点六七倍，车辆出事增加二十九倍弱。现在线路发生的大惨案次数，估计约为一九三六年的十倍。电话电报事业荒废的现象，更加严重。烧毁的也不能恢复。
    民主自由党以荒废为理由，已开始了将国营铁道出售的运动，结果国营铁道将为外国资本所收买。现在，美孚石油公司已控制了帝国石油公司及该公司支配下的东亚燃料公司在和歌山的港湾设备。美国德士古公司在日本石油公司有投资，并控制了鹤见制油厂，这些公司百分之五十一的股票为外国资本所有。这种做法，就是中国过去的汪精卫卖国政府，也没有这样做。
    我党的政策是反对引进奴役人民的外国资本。外资的利用应在贸易由国家经营、并受人民管理的条件之下进行，以便发展有利于人民大众的贸易。
