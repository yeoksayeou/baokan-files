[Ping City News] Since the Ping City Trade Company's Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Branch Company adopted the method of exchanging yarn for cloth to supply raw materials, help promote sales, and support the production of various factories, as of the end of June, according to a company survey comparing the production status of 370 weaving factories (another 40 factories have carried out exchanges, but have not been included because the contract formalities have not been completed) before and after being supported by the company, the factories originally had a total of 135 electric looms in operation, which has now increased to 247, an increase of 82.96 percent. The number of manual looms in operation has increased from 814 to 1323, an increase of 62.53 percent. The original number of employees was 1978, and now the total is 3136, an increase of 57.54 percent. The original monthly output was 23,681 bolts, which has now increased to 47,692 bolts, an increase of 101.39 percent. From the above percentages, it can also be seen that the number of workers and the number of machines in operation have only increased by slightly more than half of the original number, while the monthly output has more than doubled, which fully proves the improvement of workers' production efficiency and the sufficient supply of raw materials.

Among the 370 factories, Yuhua Heji, Fuchang, Yijucheng, Huabei, Xinhua, San Hengtong, Cihua, and others had all ceased production before liberation, and many others were closed or partially closed. After the company's support, for example, one section of the orphanage increased from 29 workers to 97, the number of machines increased from 23 to 61, and the monthly output increased from 920 bolts to 2,745 bolts. The number of workers in the Zhongsheng Factory increased from 11 to 35, the number of machines in operation increased from 6 to 15, and the monthly output increased from 180 bolts to 480 bolts, which is 266.67 percent of the original output.
