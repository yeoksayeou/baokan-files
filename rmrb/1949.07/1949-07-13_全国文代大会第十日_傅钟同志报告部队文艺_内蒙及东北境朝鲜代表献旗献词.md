The Tenth Day of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers

Comrade Fu Zhong Reports on Literary and Art Work in the Armed Forces

Representatives of the Korean People from Inner Mongolia and Northeast China Present Banners and Speeches

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Yesterday (July 12) was the tenth day of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers. The meeting continued, chaired by Ke Zhongping. First, Xiao San reported on his attendance at the 150th Anniversary Commemorative Meeting for Pushkin in the Soviet Union. Then, Fu Zhong, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, reported on "Literary and Art Work of the People's Liberation Army." During the meeting, representatives of the Korean ethnic group from Northeast China and representatives from Inner Mongolia presented banners, speeches, and performances. Before the adjournment, the veteran writer Wang Tongzhao, who had just arrived in Ping from Qingdao, recited a poem he wrote for the congress. In Xiao San's report, he emphasized the Soviet Union's respect and love for Pushkin and the Soviet people's infinite excitement about the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In Fu Zhong's report, he pointed out that the People's Liberation Army attaches great importance to literature and art. As early as the era of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, Chairman Mao instructed in the Gutian Conference Resolution to use literary and art forms to educate the troops. Therefore, literary and art work in the People's Liberation Army has always been an integral part of political work, closely coordinated with combat missions, and has developed under extremely difficult conditions. There are three prominent characteristics of literary and art work in the armed forces: First, it has the strong leadership of the Party; second, it is completely based on reality, serving the masses and serving the needs of combat; third, it is broad-based and rich in content. He welcomed literary and art workers to visit and work in the armed forces.

At 3:50 p.m., during the break in Fu Zhong's speech, representatives of the 1.5 million Korean people in Northeast China presented a banner to the congress. Then, their representative, Cui Feng, delivered a speech to the congress, saying: "Because the Chinese Communist Party has a correct policy towards ethnic minorities, and with the special concern of the Northeast Bureau, I have the honor to participate in this congress, which makes me once again realize the greatness of the Chinese Communist Party." Finally, he expressed his hope that Chinese literary and art workers would provide more guidance and assistance to the Korean literary and art movement. After his speech, at the enthusiastic request of all the representatives, their performing arts troupe sang "Annihilation" and "Song of Meritorious Soldiers."

Then, representatives of the Inner Mongolian ethnic group presented a banner to the congress, "Develop New Literary and Art Movements of All Nationalities." Yongfu, director of the preparatory committee of the Inner Mongolia Literary Association, delivered a speech to the congress on behalf of the two million people of the Inner Mongolian ethnic group. He said: "Before August 15th, the people of Inner Mongolia lived under the multiple oppressions of Japanese imperialism, Kuomintang Han chauvinism, and Inner Mongolian feudal princes and officials. They were politically unequal and unfree, their economic lives were poor, and their culture was equally barren. But now it is different. Under the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party, we also have our own people's performing arts troupes and pictorial agencies. And we have developed from not having a single literary and art worker to having more than 500 literary and art workers." Finally, he hoped that the new literary association, which is about to be established at this congress, would set up a department specializing in the study of literary and art of ethnic minorities.

After his speech, two female representatives from Inner Mongolia who presented the banner performed a "Mongolian Dance," followed by representatives of teachers and students from Fu Jen Catholic University presenting a banner and a speech to the congress. Finally, the veteran writer Wang Tongzhao, who had just arrived in Ping from Qingdao, recited a poem he wrote for the congress, entitled "Ode to the Congress of Literary and Art Workers."

　　全国文代大会第十日
  　傅钟同志报告部队文艺
    内蒙及东北境朝鲜代表献旗献词
    【本报讯】全国文代大会昨天（十二日）为第十日，会议继续举行，柯仲平主席。首由萧三报告出席苏联普式庚一百五十周年纪念大会的经过。继由中国人民解放军军委政治部副主任傅钟报告“人民解放军文艺工作”。会中并有东北境内朝鲜民族代表及内蒙古代表等献旗、献词和表演。休会前并有新从青岛抵平的老作家王统照朗诵他写给大会的诗。萧三的报告中，着重指出苏联对普式庚的敬爱及苏联人民对中国人民解放军的胜利感到无限兴奋的情形。傅钟报告中指出人民解放军是重视文艺的，远在工农红军时代，古田会议决议中毛主席即指示要用文艺的形式来教育部队。因此人民解放军中文艺工作历来就是政治工作的一个组成部分，和战斗任务密切配合，同时又是在极艰苦的条件下发展起来的。部队文艺工作有三个显著的特点：第一它是有党的坚强的领导；第二它是完全从实际出发，服务于群众，服务于战斗的需要；第三它是广大群众性的，内容生动丰富。他欢迎文艺工作者到部队去参观、工作。
    下午三点五十分，傅钟讲话的休息中间有代表东北境内朝鲜民族一百五十万人的代表向大会献旗。接着并由他们的代表崔峰向大会献词，说：“因为中国共产党对少数民族有正确的政策，在东北局特别关心下，我得到参加大会的光荣机会，这使我再一次认识到中国共产党的伟大。”最后，他希望中国的文艺工作者对朝鲜文艺运动多多指导与帮助。他献词以后，在全场代表热烈要求下，他们的文工队唱出“歼灭”和“功臣之歌”。
    接着内蒙古民族代表向大会献旗“开展各民族的新文艺运动”，并由内蒙古文协筹委会主任勇夫代表内蒙古民族二百万人向大会献词，他说：“八一五以前内蒙古人民是在日本帝国主义、国民党大汉族主义以及内蒙封建王公官僚重重压榨下生活的，在政治上不平等不自由，经济生活穷苦不堪，文化也如此荒凉。但是现在不同了，在中国共产党的领导与帮助下，我们也有了人民自己的文工队、画报社了。并且由没有一个文艺工作者，发展到五百多个文艺工作者了。”最后他希望在这次大会上即将成立的新文联能设立一个专门研究少数民族文艺的部门。
    在他的献词以后，并有两位内蒙古的献旗的女代表表演“蒙古舞”，接着是辅仁大学师生代表向大会献旗、献词。最后，新从青岛抵平的老作家王统照朗诵了他写给大会的诗，题为“文代大会颂”。
