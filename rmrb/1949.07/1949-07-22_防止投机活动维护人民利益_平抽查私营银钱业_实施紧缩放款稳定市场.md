　　To prevent unlawful merchants from speculating during price fluctuations and to safeguard the interests of the people, the People's Bank of Beiping Branch dispatched twenty inspection teams on both the 20th and 21st to conduct random business inspections of private banks and money shops in the city. The teams inspected eight banks, including Yanye, Dazhong, Zhongnan, Zhejiang Xingye, United Commercial, Dalu, Zhongfu, and Jin Cheng, as well as twelve money shops, including Fushunde, Derunxing, Chunhe, Tongyuanxiang, Hengxing, Qianxing, Yongzeng, Yiju, Datetong, Housheng, Quanjuhou, and Jinhongyu. On the first day of inspection (the 20th), in addition to uncovering illegal gold and silver speculation at Datetong Money Shop, it was found that most banks and shops had irregularities in their operations. These included insufficient cash reserves, resorting to interbank lending when withdrawals occurred, and having term deposits that were essentially treated as demand deposits to avoid deposit reserves and cash reserves. In the loan portfolios of the banks and shops, the majority of loans were directed towards private businesses, with very little going to the production sector, and among private businesses, grain and cloth merchants accounted for the majority. In addition, it was discovered that accounting procedures were chaotic and incomplete, and that unsecured loans generally exceeded the regulations (the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Private Banks and Money Shops in the North China Region" stipulated that unsecured loans should not exceed 50% of deposits). In some individual banks and shops, the total amount of loans even exceeded the total amount of deposits. The branch has already taken legal action against Datetong Money Shop for its illegal activities. The other findings are still being compiled and will be dealt with separately after the completion of the inspection of all banks and shops.
    [Another Dispatch] While inspecting the banks and shops, the branch also implemented a tightening of credit. On the 20th, it notified all specialized banks and offices to temporarily suspend all general loans in order to stabilize the market.
