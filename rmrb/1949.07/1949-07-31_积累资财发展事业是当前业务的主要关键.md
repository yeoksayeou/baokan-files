　　Accumulating Capital and Developing Enterprises are the Main Keys to Current Business
    Following this, Deputy Director Feng pointed out that accumulating capital and developing enterprises are the main keys to current business. The first thing to do is: everything should be calculated, and everything should have standards. In the past, various units often did not consider market conditions and lacked cost accounting and planning. The factory's establishment, standards, and reporting system have already been discussed and stipulated, but formalistic deviations should be prevented. Secondly, attention should be paid to reducing production costs, improving production quality, continuing to promote conservation, and making good use of machinery and materials. Regarding learning new leadership methods, Deputy Director Feng said: Learn democratic management methods that rely on workers, pay attention to and master statistical figures as a method for researching and solving problems, and launch production competitions and summarize their experiences. Finally, he also gave appropriate instructions on issues such as welfare, vehicle accidents, and wage bonuses, and encouraged all personnel to work hard to learn technology and unite to work hard for people's transportation. Finally, Cao Chengzong, Director of the North China Highway Administration Bureau, pointed out in his speech that the current highway transportation business must be unified, democratized, and gradually standardized to further strengthen the transportation business.

　　积累资财发展事业是当前业务的主要关键
    接着冯副局长提出积累资财，发展事业，为当前业务的主要关键。首先要做到：一切有计算，一切有标准。以往各单位，往往不考虑市场情况，缺乏对成本的计算和计划。工厂的编制、标准和表报制度，已有讨论规定，但应防止形式化的偏向。其次要注意减低生产成本，提高生产质量，继续推行节约，善于使用机具、材料。在学习新的领导方法方面，冯副局长说：学习管理民主化依靠工人的领导方法，注意并掌握统计数字，做为研究和解决问题的方法，并开展生产竞赛，总结其经验。最后他关于福利、车辆肇祸、工资分红等问题也做了适当的指示，并勉励全体人员努力学习技术，团结为人民运输而努力。最后，华北公路总局曹承宗局长讲话中，指出目前公路运输事业须统一化、民主化和逐步正规化，进一步加强运输事业。
