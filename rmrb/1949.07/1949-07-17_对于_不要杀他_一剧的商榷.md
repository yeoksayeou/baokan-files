    A Discussion of the Play "Don't Kill Him"
    Luo Qing
    There have been different opinions about the play "Don't Kill Him" in the past. It is understood that recently the play has sparked some principled debates. In order to seek a more accurate solution to the problem, in addition to publishing Comrade Liu Jia's own article on the creative process and performance effect of "Don't Kill Him" in yesterday's supplement, we are reprinting Comrade Luo Qing's comprehensive opinions on the debate about the play at the Military and Political University to provide a reference for discussion.
              ——Editor
    From my observation, this new type of opera, "Don't Kill Him," is generally quite satisfactory in terms of content and form, theme and technique. It can be called a famous play of the troops, and it can also be said to be a representative work of the new type of opera creation at the present stage.
    The main advantages of the play are three: First, the theme is clear, writing about the mass discipline of the people's army and the relationship between the army and the people, with a strong sense of reality and educational power. Second, all the lyrics and dialogues are quite popular, specific, and concise, making it easy for soldiers and the general public to understand. Third, all the musical arrangements, their melodies and rhythms, are simple and easy to sing, majestic and moving, simple and pleasing to the ear, and in modernization, they also have the unique beautiful colors and moods of Chinese folk songs.
    Not long ago, I heard that some people criticized the play for having principled errors, advocating stopping the performance, or at least fundamentally revising it. Recently, after seeing the discussion opinions on the play by the comrades of the Political Work Group of the Political Department and the Communications Group of the Third Team of the Eighth Brigade in the 50th and 55th issues of the school journal "North China Military and Political University," I understood the focus and nature of the problem. Such a debate is very meaningful, not only can it improve our theoretical and policy level, but also deepen our understanding of the role of the theater movement in the political work of the troops.
    Based on my rough impression of the play, and after repeatedly studying the two different opinions in the school journal, I generally agree with the views of the comrades of the Communications Group of the Third Team of the Eighth Brigade, and disagree with the views held by the comrades of the Political Work Group. This is not to say that the play has no shortcomings, or that there are no principled issues, I also affirm that it has, and not in small numbers, but I think it is not at its basic points. In order to learn from the playwright and comrades, I am willing to study together on several major issues.
    First, from the theme and presentation of the play:
    The theme of the play is to describe the high mass discipline of the people's army and the good relationship between the army and the people. This fine tradition of our party and our army is based on the most central idea of Comrade Mao Zedong's great ideological system on army building, that the army belongs to the people and serves the interests of the people, established and developed. The play certainly did not express our army's excellent historical tradition and various aspects of practice more completely and centrally, but it should be admitted that it has expressed the entire excellent tradition and practical spirit of our party and our army in a fairly prominent and powerful way in a very special practical case. In a word, the theme is very clear.
    Where is the problem of the play?
    First of all, the play takes the serious violation of mass discipline, in which a staff officer of a certain unit, in an emergency marching task, mistakenly forcibly grabs a guide and shoots him, as the theme, rather than taking a good typical example of our army's universal implementation of mass discipline as the theme to describe and develop. Therefore, some people may think that the material of the play does not conform to the principle and direction of singing the bright side of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Chairman Mao's literary thought. The key to the whole problem may lie here. Because this material problem is related to literary direction (which can also be said to be literary theory and policy), disciplinary principles, and mass viewpoints.
    However, as the Political Work Group comrades affirmed, "Using the vivid examples of the masses loving our army, to educate, move, and inspire the troops to cherish the enthusiasm of the people, establish the viewpoint of serving the people, in order to overcome all remarks and actions in the troops that are divorced from the masses, violate the interests of the people, and destroy our army's discipline, to achieve internal unity, unity between the army and the people, and the political purpose of defeating the enemy."
    Has such a "political purpose" been achieved by the play and its actual performance effect? Our common answer will be affirmative. Then, although the play takes a bad typical example, it describes and promotes the good tradition of our army. The bad typical example and the good tradition are originally contradictory, but they are unified here, not unified in the bad typical example, but unified in the good tradition. That is to say, it conforms to Chairman Mao's literary direction and also conforms to the disciplinary spirit of our army. Just on this point, it cannot be regarded as the error and shortcoming of the play, but a brave attempt and a rare characteristic.
    We should completely, and mainly, collect good typical examples in our army to promote the good tradition of our army. Every literary or drama worker should work hard in this direction. Taking this play as an example, another case of completing the task by implementing mass discipline, although it is a secondary line not the main line, also needs to be appropriately strengthened and promoted. However, this creative technique of adopting bad typical examples to promote good traditions should never be said that it should not be tried and adopted. The so-called "consistency of purpose and means" is also one of the essences of Chairman Mao's thought method. And facts have proved that starting from bad typical examples, that is, starting from the opposite side, as long as we correctly grasp the direction and principles of literary creation and policy discipline, and at the same time flexibly use our expression techniques, then the combativeness and criticality expressed in the unity of such literary drama practice and policy discipline practice are often more profound and powerful than the techniques developed from good typical examples or starting from the positive side. Therefore, taking the example of this play, whether we are doing literary drama or policy discipline practice criticism, we should not look at problems superficially but substantially, not mechanically and unilaterally but flexibly and comprehensively, so that we can draw more correct conclusions. This is also a viewpoint and method issue that should be determined first in discussing the play.
    Secondly, the title of the play is "Don't Kill Him." This naming is not accidental. As the name implies (of course, not thinking away from the plot), it reflects the relationship between our army and the people, mainly from the relationship between the masses and the army. As the Political Work Group comrades said in the quotation above, this is also a very important feature and key issue. Yes, the so-called mass discipline and the relationship between the army and the people, only the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army led by the proletariat party and today's People's Liberation Army, have created and established this new era and good tradition, thereby, also creating a new spirit and good tradition of cherishing the army in the broad masses of working people. The play focuses on the people loving the army, which seems to be a reversal of the guest and the host, and cannot be regarded as a point of contradiction. However, I think that either side of describing the army loving the people or the people loving the army can be the main body. Taking this play as an example, the method of reflecting the army loving the people from the people loving the army, and setting off the main aspect from the object is also realistic and in line with the law, because the Chinese people have never had any good feelings towards any military and political forces before and outside the Red Army and the People's Liberation Army. The special love of the people for our army lies not in anything else, but in the fact that our army uniquely possesses the correct policies and revolutionary discipline, and these policies and discipline embody and embody the flesh-and-blood relationship of interests between the army and the people. Therefore, reflecting and describing the army loving the people from the people loving the army, reflecting the subjective and objective unity of the relationship between the army and the people, not only does not weaken the latter but also more powerfully portrays and highlights the latter. Precisely because of this, the play, in handling the key issue of the troops accepting the people's request, "Don't kill him" for the person who violated discipline and killed people, is not blindly copying facts without criticism in creation, but cherishing the facts and actions of the masses' rare and infinite love for our army, and depicting and highlighting them, to reflect the profoundness of the loyalty and enthusiasm of our party and our army to the people. That is to say, the kind of mechanical, simple, and one-sided viewpoint that generally starts from the so-called mass discipline and the relationship between the army and the people, and from the army loving the people as the main body, will inevitably produce divergent opinions on the issue of our troops accepting the masses' request "Don't kill him."
    However, it should be pointed out that the play has a very significant principled shortcoming in the development of the theme and plot: In its entire practice of adopting bad typical examples to promote good traditions, and describing the masses loving the troops to reflect the troops loving the masses, in addition to the fact that the example of a certain staff officer intentionally ordering the shooting and killing of the masses is a very special and lacks greater representation in our troops, it should be considered whether to make certain changes in the technique when the playwright moves it into the script or on the stage. The most obvious thing is: For cadres within the troops (including certain staff officers and squad leaders, etc.) and soldiers (including cooks and guards, etc.), in the process of understanding, reviewing, and ideologically unifying this very serious bad typical example of violating mass discipline, and for the masses (including all villagers) because of the occurrence of the violation of discipline by the troops, they are suspicious, complain (the old woman, the family member of the victim) about the troops, and then to understanding the troops, forgiving the changes in the thinking and emotions of the offender. The description and mastery of the development process is not adequate enough, not appropriate enough, and not adequate enough. As a result, on the one hand, the organizational decisions, leadership intentions, and administrative orders within the troops are highlighted more, and the foundation and basis of the ideological awareness of the cadre and soldier mass discipline education are lacking; on the other hand, it also reveals more of the two extreme tendencies of the masses: when the troops forcibly grab guides and killings occur, they are afraid of and complain about the troops, and even become alarmed when they discover that there are troops coming, which is an exaggeration and does not completely conform to the facts. As far as our army is concerned, the relationship and impression of the masses are essentially different from any warlord's reactionary army. Even if some individual young troops with poor political quality and remnants of warlordism have committed certain violations of discipline among the masses, the masses will not immediately change their attitude towards our army, so this is abnormal and an extreme; when the troops apologize and compensate and execute the criminals, they show love for the troops and maintain the criminals. For example, when the old woman sees the criminal staff officer, she hardly shows any hatred expression. This is again seemingly normal but actually abnormal emotion. Therefore, in the emotional changes of the masses before and after, it is obviously not very coherent, and the transformation is very stiff and abrupt. As far as the troops are concerned, the leadership's execution of discipline lacks the basis of mass class consciousness, and the ideological education struggle is very inadequate, which will weaken the significance and effect of the implementation of policies and disciplines. As far as the local masses are concerned, their love for the troops carries more emotional components, and their understanding of this issue is very inadequate, which also weakens the educational role and power of the troops. Therefore, these places must be revised and supplemented in order to better highlight the theme and make the entire plot more in line with objective reality and laws. As for the fact that the local party and government have no ancillary descriptions or insertions in the process of the occurrence and development of this major event of violating mass discipline, it is also a shortcoming of the play.
    This is the overall advantages and disadvantages of the play in terms of theme and presentation techniques, and the advantages are still the main and basic things. This is my overall understanding and criticism of the play.
    Second, study from the spirit of policy and discipline
    Since the play adopts the worst typical example of violating the interests of the masses, there is an opinion that the play does not resolutely execute the staff officer who violated the discipline and killed people at the end, "which is contrary to the spirit of policy and discipline." Here, let us study how to view the spirit of policy and discipline from the play.
    There is no doubt that policy and discipline are the political life of our party and our army. Our party and our army rely on policy and discipline to maintain and connect the masses of the people and our flesh-and-blood relationship, and obtain the heartfelt support and support of the people, and also obtain the glorious title of the people's army that matches the name and the reality, which is certain. According to the opinions of the comrades of the Political Work Group, "The play also vigorously declared that discipline should be implemented, and also made a solemn decision to execute," which is also affirmative. These two affirmative points are connected with the overall evaluation of the play by the Political Work Group comrades quoted in the previous question, which proves that the play has achieved the "political purpose" of promoting the spirit of policy and discipline of our party and our army, which should also be affirmed. Since this is the case, then there is every reason to affirm that there is basically no "principled problem" of "violating the spirit of policy and discipline" in the play.
    However, the reason of the comrades of the Political Work Group is: "However, only because the masses requested and interceded, the determination was shaken and the decision was changed, which is not good. In fact, it destroys the policy, weakens the discipline, makes the policy and discipline loose, becomes unprincipled, gives the masses a bad impression and understanding, and destroys the prestige and connection of the party among the masses." I think this paragraph is contradictory to the previous two paragraphs. Why is this so? Because the previous two paragraphs are based on the actual content and plot of the play and the actual effect of the performance, while the latter paragraph is divorced from these two actualities and is the result of abstract idealistic deduction. It is a detachment from the spirit and essence of the policy and discipline of our party and our army. It is not to look at the problem comprehensively from all aspects of the entire execution process of policy and discipline (including criticism, confinement, party committee review decisions, sending personnel to apologize and compensate, public trial in public, announcing execution, etc.), effects, and mass influence, but is the result of looking at the problem isolatedly, limitedly, and formally from the point of execution or not. The spirit of policy and discipline is of course entrusted to and expressed in our specific actions, but for so many aspects of a large number of practical actions, we do not attach importance, but only focus on the point of "execution," which is to abandon the actual "political purpose" that the execution of the policy and discipline of our party and our army wants to achieve, and to pursue the so-called supernatural "political purpose." The disciplinary sanctions of our party and our army, on the one hand, lie in maintaining the common interests of the masses and our party and our army, and at the same time, they are also to educate and improve the political awareness of the troops and the masses. It is one of the positive practical actions. Execution only has negative significance for the offender itself, but no positive significance. Execution is completely for educating the troops and the masses, but since the effect and purpose of educating the troops and the masses have been received and achieved in a certain process of discipline execution, why must it be executed? In this case, emphasizing the execution of the execution mechanically and unilaterally, I think is not in line with the spirit of policy and discipline, and has a purely punitive point of view. Therefore, the handling of the troops at that time and the play on this issue is appropriate.
    Third, study from the class point of view and the mass point of view
    Is accepting the masses' request "Don't kill him" a tailism that loses principles? My answer is no. The masses' "Don't kill him" is because the masses have clearly and deeply recognized and realized the correctness and seriousness of the policies and disciplines of our party and our army in their practical experience, and confirmed that their interests have been fully respected and guaranteed. The masses, only the masses, are the final and true verifiers of the practice of our party and our army's policies and disciplines.
    As far as the family members of the victims are concerned, they are rural proletarians or semi-proletarians who have been turned over. After the killing incident that violated mass discipline, the deepest sorrow and contradiction in the hearts of these laborers is: "Our own people killed our own people." That is to say, the masses, to some extent, understand that this unfortunate incident is regarded as an internal problem of the class or the revolutionary camp. Therefore, when the troops made the implementation of strict military discipline and the execution of criminals, they firmly regarded this matter as an internal problem, and insisted that "Don't kill him." How sincere and clear is the class feelings and policy viewpoints expressed in the sentence "Leave him to fight Lao Jiang"! That is to say, the masses also believe that the criminal behavior of a certain staff officer is very serious and should not be forgiven, but when they make it clear that this incident occurred in the People's Liberation Army, who is working for their welfare, which is also their own sons and brothers, and not in any other warlord's reactionary armed forces that oppress them, and make it clear that the criminal behavior of a certain staff officer is only an absolutely individual and extremely accidental phenomenon in our army (which is very different from the general phenomenon of beating and scolding the masses), under the practical spirit and excellent traditions of the serious policies and disciplines of our party and our army, it can be completely corrected and overcome, and the time to correct it will come immediately, they gradually and quickly consider the gains and losses in the internal relationship between a person himself or a son and brother being killed and then using another person himself or son to pay for his life, and for the overall revolutionary interests, so they decided "Don't kill him," "Leave him to fight Lao Jiang." Here, it also reflects the full consciousness and confidence of the masses in their own strength to love, supervise, and educate the troops. Even if this consciousness and confidence may not be very clear in their subjectivity, it has been fully expressed in their objective practice. That is to say, the practical spirit of our party and our army in policies and disciplines has profoundly and rapidly influenced and improved the masses, and improved the masses to participate in the execution practice of our party and our army's policies and disciplines with the mentality and posture of masters. This unity of military and civilian practice has created the conditions allowed by the policies and disciplines of "Don't kill him." Here, the masses are not out of any backward right-wing ideological concerns, such as fearing that after killing a certain staff officer, the relationship between the troops and them will become estranged, continue to deteriorate, and even be retaliated, or close to any vulgar compassion and superstitious ideas of cause and effect. Then the troops' acceptance of their demands is naturally not a concession or appeasement behavior that abandons principles and destroys policies and disciplines. That is to say, on the troops' side, the decision to execute a certain staff officer is completely necessary and correct, and when the masses express unparalleled love and demand "Don't kill him," the troops' acceptance of this demand and non-execution is also necessary and correct. This not only uses the seriousness of the discipline of our party and our army to educate the troops in general, but also uses the masses' very special violation of discipline and the very great forgiveness and love to educate the troops, so that the troops deeply appreciate the greatness of the masses' love and strength, and establish and strengthen their mass viewpoint and discipline viewpoint. Such treatment is flexible and wise, and is in line with the spirit of the party in handling internal problems and the mass viewpoint.
    Fourth, study from the perspective of educating the troops
    The handling of a certain staff officer in the play is based on a real fact. Two problems may also occur here:
    One is whether a certain unit at that time had the possibility to insist on implementing the execution and did not fully strive to do so? In fact and in the plot, the masses at that time disregarded everything to maintain the criminal, entangled with the criminal, and obstructed the execution. Although they were persuaded earnestly in many ways, it was ineffective in the end. Under this specific and vivid situation and scene, there are only two ways to achieve the task of execution: one is to temporarily appease the masses and execute it behind the masses; the other is to forcibly coerce the masses to get out of the way and force the execution on the spot. However, even if these two methods complete the task of execution, they make us commit two more errors. The former is to deceive the masses, and the latter is to threaten the masses. Even if we can carry out various persuasions, explanations, apologies, etc. after the execution, we measure the task of completing the execution and the two errors committed because of this. In terms of the impact and interest relationship in the masses, although the masses may be finally understood for the two errors we committed, it is also possible to further improve the prestige of our army, but is it possible that there are other defects that are enough to damage our prestige and the relationship between the army and the people? If the masses feel the ruthlessness and strictness of our army's discipline, the so-called "enforcement of the law is as strong as a mountain," so that they will be afraid of love, thereby developing a tendency to protect and conceal certain violations of mass discipline, and dare not or are unwilling to actively help supervise and educate our troops? If there is such a possibility, then we accept the masses' request for "Don't kill him" and refuse the masses' request and implement the execution can achieve the "political purpose" of our policy and discipline practice. Comparing the gains and losses, the latter is inevitably outweighed by the losses. This is from the perspective of mass influence.
    The second question is: Will the play not executing a certain staff officer leave a loophole in the practical education of policy and discipline in the troops? Some people may think that no matter how serious the mass discipline is violated, as long as the understanding of the masses is obtained, the troops themselves can routinely act sloppily? I admit that this wrong idea may be produced or exist in the minds of very few backward elements, but as mentioned earlier, in the play, the troops' acceptance of the masses' request not to execute a certain staff officer does not at all forgive any violations of mass discipline because of the love and strength of the masses. That is to say, in the play, there is no suggestion that our troops should follow the same method and outcome for any serious violations of discipline in the future. Of course, here, the play also exposes a big shortcoming and error, such as when the masses forgive the offender and allow him to repent and reform, and know his mistakes and correct them, it is right and completely necessary, but if the old woman says: "Child, you are not guilty..." even if it comes from the mouth of the masses, it is extremely inappropriate, unreasonable, and unreasonable. The family members of the victims, in any case, will not think and say this. If there is such a dialogue, then the playwright should review and correct it ideologically. We should also write the masses' "Don't kill him" to love the troops completely principled, so that it will not leave subjective loopholes in the educational significance of the script. (This has also been corrected during the performance.)
    However, even if the execution is carried out in fact or in the play, and the script itself has no loopholes, it can never be said that this will prevent any individual violations of discipline and the occurrence of wrong ideas from now on. The important or central issue is that the troops themselves are constantly and constantly grasping the practical education of policies and disciplines, and this is a long-term practical struggle task in all aspects. And in terms of this case and the play, it can only be an example, a typical, and an aspect of the practical struggle education of our army's policies and disciplines, but not the only example and the only typical, and can include all aspects. Therefore, we should not demand to use an example and typical, a play, to include and solve all the tasks in the practical struggle education of our army's policies and disciplines. This point is very important whether it is for the understanding of the play or for the actual life of our troops. (End)

    对于“不要杀他”一剧的商榷
    罗青
    对于“不要杀他”一剧，过去即存在过不同的意见。据了解最近对该剧又引起一些带有原则性的争论。为使问题能求得较确切的解决，我们除已于昨日副刊上刊登了流笳同志本人谈“不要杀他”的创作过程及演出效果一文外，特将罗青同志对军大关于该剧争论的发表的综合意见转载于此，以供讨论中参考。
              ——编者              
    “不要杀他”这部新型歌剧，就我观感所得，不论在内容与形式，主题与技巧等各方面，一般的都颇使人满意，可称部队名剧，也不妨说是现阶段新型歌剧创作上的一个代表作。
    该剧的主要优点有三：第一、主题明确，写的是人民军队的群众纪律与军民关系问题，有强烈的现实感与教育力量。第二、全部歌词对话，都相当的通俗、具体、精炼，能使士兵与一般群众易听易懂。第三、全部配曲，其旋律节奏，都简单易唱，雄壮动人，淳朴悦耳，在现代化中，还带有中国民歌特具的优美的色彩和情调。
    不久以前，听说有人批评该剧带有原则性的错误，主张加以停演，至少要予以根本的修改。最近，在本校“华北军大”校刊第五○期及第五五期上，先后看到了政治部政工组和八大队三队通讯组的同志们，关于该剧的讨论意见以后，才知道了问题的焦点和性质的一部。这样的争论是很有意义的，不但能提高我们理论政策水平，而且也可以加深我们对戏剧运动在部队政治工作中作用的认识。
    根据我对该剧粗略的印象，把校刊上两种不同意见，反复研究的结果，我大体上赞同八大队三队通讯组同志们的观点，而不同意象政工组同志们所持的观点。这并非说该剧就没有缺点，或者就没有任何带原则性的问题了，我也肯定它有，并且不在少，但是我认为不是在其基本点上，为了向剧作者和同志们学习，我愿在几个主要问题上来共同研究。
    第一、从该剧的主题和表现手法上来研究：
    该剧的主题，是描写人民军队高度的群众纪律和良好的军民关系问题，我党我军的这一优良传统是依据毛泽东同志伟大的思想体系中关于建军的最中心的思想，军队属于人民，并为人民的利益服务这一点，建立与发展起来的。该剧当然没有把我军的这一优良的历史传统和各方面的实践，更完备的集中的表现出来，但是应当承认，他已在一个极特殊的实践事例上把我党我军整个的优良传统和实践精神，相当突出的有力的表现出来了，一句话主题是很明确的。
    该剧的问题在哪里呢？
    首先该剧所采取的是以某部队的参谋，在紧急的行军任务中，错误的硬抓向导并加枪杀的严重违犯群众纪律的坏的典型为主题，而不是采取我军普遍执行群纪中的好典型为主题，来加以描写和展开的。因此，也许有人认为该剧的取材，不符合毛主席文艺思想中关于歌颂工农兵的光明面的原则方向，全部问题的关键，很可能是发生于此。因为这一取材问题，关系到文艺方向（也可说是文艺理论政策）、纪律原则以及群众观点诸问题。
    但是该剧正如政工组同志们一个肯定的意见所说：“用群众热爱我军的生动事例，教育、感动并激发部队爱护人民的热情，树立为人民服务的观点，借以克服部队中一切脱离群众，违犯人民利益，破坏我军纪律的言论和行动，达到内部团结，军民团结，战胜敌人的政治目的”。
    这样的“政治目的”是不是已为该剧及其演出的实际效果所达到了呢？我们共同的答复将是肯定的。那末，该剧虽然所采取的是一个坏典型，然而却描写和发扬出我军的好传统。坏典型与好传统本来是矛盾着的，可是在这里得到了统一，不是统一于坏典型，而是统一于好传统。这就是说，既符合了毛主席的文艺方向，也符合了我军的纪律精神。单就这一点说，不但不能算是该剧的错误和缺点，而且是一种勇敢的尝试和稀有的特点。
    我们完全应当，主要的以搜取我军中的好典型，来发扬我军的好传统，每一个文艺或戏剧工作者，都应当多向这方向努力，就以该剧来说，对于执行群纪而完成任务的另一事例，虽然是一个副线不是主线，也有再予适当加强描写发扬的必要。然而，这种采用坏典型发扬好传统的创作手法，决不能说不应尝试与采用。所谓“目的与手段一致，”也是毛主席思想方法的精髓之一。并且事实证明，从坏的典型事例，也就是从反面入手，只要我们正确的掌握文艺创作与政策纪律的方向原则，而同时灵活的运用我们的表现手法，则在这样的文艺戏剧的实践与政策纪律的实践的统一性上，所表现的战斗性与批判性，往往是比从好典型或从正面入手展开的手法，更加深刻而有力的。因此，以该剧的范例来说，我们不管是作文艺戏剧或政策纪律的实践的批评，都应当不是表面的而是实质的，不是机械的片面的而是灵活的全面的看问题，这才能得出比较正确的结论。这也是在讨论该剧所应首先确定的一个观点和方法问题。
    其次，该剧剧名是“不要杀他”，这个定名不是偶然的，顾名思义（当然不是离开剧情去想）它是以群众对军队的关系为主体来反映我军对人民的关系的。正如前面所引政工组同志们所说的话一样，这也是一个很重要的特点和关键问题。是的，所谓群众纪律与军民关系，只有无产阶级党所领导的工农红军和今天的人民解放军，才开创和树立了这个新的纪元和好的传统，从而，也才在广大劳动人民群众中，产生了爱护军队的新精神和好传统。该剧以民爱军为主体，似乎是宾主倒置，也不能视为一个矛盾点。然而，在我认为描写军爱民或民爱军的任何一方为主体都可以，以该剧来说，从民爱军来反映军爱民，从客体来衬托主体方面的方法，也是合实际合规律的，因为中国人民对于红军与人民解放军以前和以外的任何军政从来就没有丝毫好感的。人民群众对我军的特殊宠爱，不在别的，正在于我军独特具备着正确的政策与革命的纪律，这种政策与纪律是体现了与体现着军民一家血肉相联的利益关系的。因此，以民爱军为主体来反映与描写军爱民，反映出军民关系主客观的统一，不但丝毫不减弱后者而且更有力的刻画和突出后者，正因为如此，该剧在处理部队接受群众要求，对于违纪杀人者“不要杀他”这一关键问题上，不但不是在创作上无批判的硬搬事实，而是珍视群众对我军稀有的无限的热爱的事实行动，加以刻画和突出，以反映我党我军对人民的忠诚热情的深刻性。这就是说，那种机械单纯片面的从一般所谓群众纪律军民关系，从军爱民为主体出发的观点，就必然产生对我部队接受群众要求“不要杀他”的问题上的分歧意见了。
    可是应当指出该剧在主题与剧情的展开上，有一个很重大的带原则性的缺点：在其采用坏典型发扬好传统，描写群众热爱部队以反映部队热爱群众的全部实践中，除了对某参谋这种有意命令开枪杀害群众，这一事例，在我们部队来说，是非常特殊而缺乏较大的代表性的一个典型，在剧作者将它搬入剧本或舞台时，应否在手法上予以一定程度的改变，这问题还未考虑成熟外，最明显的是：对于部队内的干部（包括某参谋与班长等）士兵群众（包括伙夫警卫员等），在这种十分严重的违犯群纪的坏典型事例的认识、检讨与思想统一过程上，及对于群众（包括所有村民）因部队违纪事件的发生而疑惧、埋怨（被害家属老太婆）部队，而转到谅解部队，赦免犯罪者的这种思想情绪的变化发展过程的描写掌握上，还有很不够入情、不够确当和充分的地方。结果，一方面，便较多的突出了部队内的组织决定，领导意图与行政命令，而缺乏干部与士兵群众纪律教育思想觉悟的基础和根据；另一方面，也较多的暴露出群众两个极端倾向：在部队强抓向导及杀人事件发生时，则恐惧与埋怨部队，甚至一发现有部队来就很惊慌，这是夸大而不完全符合事实的，在我军来说，对群众的关系和印象，无论如何是与任何军阀的反动军队有本质的区别的，即使个别年轻的政治素质差的，有残余的军阀主义的部队，在群众中发生过某些违犯纪律行为，群众也不会就一下子改变了对我军的态度，所以这是不正常的，是一个极端；在部队道歉陪罪和处决犯罪者时，又表现热爱部队维护犯罪者，如老太婆见了犯罪的某参谋时，几乎没表露出什么憎恨的表情，这就又是似正常而实际非正常的情感了。所以在群众的情感的前后变化上，显然是不很联贯，转变得很生硬而突然的。这在部队来说，领导上对纪律的执行是缺乏群众阶级自觉的基础的，思想上的教育斗争是非常不够，这就会削弱了政策纪律执行的意义和效果。在地方群众来说，对于部队的热爱，带着较多的情感成份，在本问题上的认识，表现很不够，也就削弱了对部队的教育作用和力量，因此，这些地方，必须予以修正和补充，才能使主题能够更好的突出，使整个剧情，更符合于客观实际与规律。至于对地方党与政权，在这个违犯群纪的重大事件发生与发展的过程中，竟没有任何附描或插叙，也是该剧的一个缺点。
    这就是该剧在主题与表现手法上，总的优点和缺点，而优点仍然是主要的和基本的东西。这是我对该剧的一个总的认识和批评。
    第二、从政策纪律精神来研究
    由于该剧所采取的是一个违犯群众利益的最坏典型，因而就有一种意见，认为该剧在结局上，没有坚决处决违犯纪律杀人的某参谋，“与政策纪律精神相违背”。这里我们就来研究一下，怎样从该剧来看政策纪律的精神问题。
    没有疑问，政策纪律是我党我军的政治生命，我党我军靠着政策纪律来维护与联系人民大众和我们的血肉关系，取得人民的衷心拥护与支持，也才取得了名实相符的人民军队的光荣称号，这是肯定的。根据政工组同志们的意见，认为“该剧也力申应该执行纪律，而也作出了处决的严正决定”，这也是肯定的。这两个肯定点是与前一问题中所引政工组同志们对该剧的总的评价联系起来说，证明了该剧已达到了发扬我党我军的政策纪律精神的“政治目的”了，这也是应当肯定的。既然如此，那就完全有理由可以肯定该剧在基本上没有“违背政策纪律精神”的“带有原则性问题”的存在了。
    然而政工组同志们的理由是：“但仅又因为群众的请求和说情而动摇了决心，改变决定，这是不好的，实际上是破坏了政策，削弱了纪律，就会使政策与纪律废弛，变为没有原则，就会给群众以不良印象和认识，就会破坏了党在群众中的威信和联系。”我认为这一段话是和前两段话互相矛盾的，为什么会如此呢？由于前两段话，是实事求是的从该剧的内容剧情的实际和演出的实际效果出发的，而后一段话则是离开了这两种实际，流于抽象的唯心推断的结果，乃是脱离了我党我军的政策纪律的精神和实质，不是全面的从政策纪律的整个执行过程、（包括批评、禁闭、党委检讨决定、派员道歉陪罪、当众公审、宣布处决等等）效果、群众影响等等各方面看问题，而是孤立的、局限的、形式的从处决的执行与否一点上看问题的结果。政策纪律的精神当然依托与表现在我们的具体行动上的，可是对于这样多方面的大量的实际行动不加重视，而只重视了“处决”一点，乃是抛开了我党我军政策纪律的执行所欲达到实际的“政治目的”，而去追求所谓超现实的“政治目的”了。我党我军的纪律制裁，一方面在于维护群众和我党我军的共同利益，同时，也是为了教育与提高部队和群众的政治觉悟，是一种积极的实际行动之一，处决对于犯罪者本身说，实际只有消极意义而无积极意义了，处决完全为的教育部队和群众，但既然在纪律执行的一定过程中，已经收到与达到了教育部队和群众的效果和目的，又为什么非处决不可呢？在这种情况下，不顾一切机械片面的强调执行处决，我以为是不合政策纪律精神，带有一种单纯惩罚观点的意味的。因此不论部队在当时及该剧在这问题上的处理都是适当的。
    第三、从阶级观点与群众观点上来研究
    接受群众要求“不要杀他”，是不是失去原则的尾巴主义呢？我的答复是否定的？群众的“不要杀他”，乃是由于群众在他们的实际经验中，明显而深刻的认识与体会到，我党我军政策纪律的正确性与严肃性，确认他们的利益得到了充分的尊重与保障的结果。群众，只有群众，才是我党我军政策纪律实践的最后的真正的检证者。
    就被害家属来说，是一个乡村翻了身的无产者或半无产者，违犯群纪的杀人事件发生以后，在这个劳动者心灵内部最深刻的悲哀和矛盾是：“自己人杀了自己人”，这就是说，群众在某种程度上，懂得把这种不幸事件，看着是阶级内部或革命阵营内部的问题的。因之当部队作出了严整军纪处决罪犯的实施时，他们就坚定不移的把这件事当作是内部问题来处理，而坚持是“不要杀他”。“留下他打老蒋”这句所表现的群众的阶级感情与政策观点话何等的真挚而明确呀！这就是说，某参谋的犯罪行为，群众也认为是十分严正的，本来是不原谅的，但当他们明确了这事件发生在为他们谋福利打天下的人民解放军也就是他们的子弟兵身上，而不是发生在其他任何压迫他们的军阀反动武装身上，明确了某参谋的犯罪行为，只是我军中绝对个别和极其偶然的现象（这与一般打骂群众的现象是有很大差别的）在我党我军严肃的政策与纪律的实践精神及优良传统之下，是完全可以纠正和克服，而且马上就有了纠正的时候，他们便逐渐而又很快的由考虑到一个自己人或一个子弟的被杀再用另一个自己人或子弟来抵罪偿命，对于自己和整个革命利益内部关系上的得失问题，于是决心“不要杀他”，“留下他打老蒋”了。这里也反映了群众对其本身爱护、监督与教育部队的力量的充分自觉性自信心，即使这种自觉性与自信心在其主观上或许还不够十分明确，但在其客观的实践上，已是充分的表现出来了的。这就是说，我党我军在政策纪律上的实践精神，深刻而迅速的影响与提高了群众，提高群众到以主人翁的心情与姿态，来参与我党我军政策纪律的执行实践，这种军民实践的统一，便造成了“不要杀他”在政策纪律上所允许的条件。在这里，群众不是出于任何落后的右的思想顾虑，如怕杀了某参谋以后，将使部队与他们的关系，有发生隔阂，继续恶化，甚至遭到报复的可能，或是近于什么庸俗的慈悲恻隐心肠因果迷信观念等。则部队接受其要求自然也就不是什么放弃原则破坏政策纪律等等的迁就或姑息行为。这就是说，在部队方面，对处决某参谋的决定是完全必要的正确的，而在群众表现无比的热爱，要求“不要杀他”时，部队接受此要求，不执行处决也是必要的正确的。这不但是一般的用我党我军的纪律的严肃性来教育了部队，而且更运用群众对于这非常特殊的违犯纪律行为的非常伟大的宽恕与热爱来教育部队，使部队深刻体会到群众的热爱与力量的伟大，而树立与加强其群众观点与纪律观点，这样的处理是灵活而明智的，是符合党的处理内部问题和群众观点的精神的。
    第四、从对部队教育来研究
    该剧对某参谋的处理，是根据一个实在的事实来的。这里还可能发生两个问题：
    一个是某部队在当时是否有坚持贯彻执行处决的可能而未充分争取做到？事实与剧情上，当时群众不顾一切的维护罪犯，同罪犯缠成一团，阻挠着执行，虽经多方恳切说服，终无效果，在这种具体生动的情况和场面下，只有两种办法，可能达到处决的任务：或者是暂时缓和群众，事后背着群众执行；或者是当场武力胁迫群众让开强迫执行。然而这两种办法，即使完成了处决的任务，却使我们又犯了两个错误，前者是欺骗群众后者是威胁群众，纵然我们可以在处决后再进行多方的说服解释道歉等等的工作，但我们衡量完成处决任务与因此所犯两种错误，在群众中的影响和利害关系来说，虽然群众对于我们所犯的两种错误，可能是最后加以谅解，也有可能更加提高了我军的威信，可是，这里是不是也可能产生另外足以损害我们的威信和军民关系的缺陷呢？如使群众感到我军纪律的无情的森严性，所谓“执法如山”，因而由爱生畏，从而发生包庇隐瞒某些违犯群纪行为的倾向，不敢或不肯积极的帮助监督与教育我们部队？如有此可能，则把接受群众“不要杀他”的要求与拒绝群众要求而贯彻处决两者同样都能达到我们政策纪律实践的“政治目的”，得失相比，后者就未免得而有失了。这是从群众影响来说。
    其次一个问题是：该剧不处决某参谋是否会在部队内留下政策纪律实践教育上的空子，可能有人以为不管犯多么严重的群众纪律，只要得到群众的谅解，部队本身就可以照例马虎行事？这种错误的思想，我承认有可能在极个别的落后分子头脑中产生或存在，但是前面已经说到，在该剧中部队接受群众要求不处决某参谋，却丝毫并没有因群众的热爱与力量而就原谅任何违犯群纪行为的意味，也就是说在该剧中，并没有提供着我们部队今后对任何严重的违犯纪律行为，都应当按照同一方法与结局来处理的暗示。——当然，在这里该剧也暴露了一个很大的缺点和错误，如当群众宽恕犯罪者，许其悔过自新，知错力改是对的，完全必要的，但如写老太婆说：“孩子，你是没有罪的……”云云，即使是出于群众之口，也是极不妥当和极不合理与不合情的。被害者家属，无论如何是不会这样想和这样说的。假如有此对话，则剧作者应当从思想上加以检讨和纠正。我们把群众的“不要杀他”热爱部队，也应当写得完全是有原则性的才对，这样才不会在剧本的教育意义上留下主观的漏洞。（这在演出时，亦已纠正了。）
    不过，即便在事实上或在该剧中执行了处决，以及剧本本身做到一无漏洞，也绝对不能说，就会从此杜绝了任何个别的违犯纪律行为与错误思想的发生，重要的或中心的问题，在于部队本身经常的不断的抓紧政策纪律的实践教育，而这是各方面的一个长期的实践斗争任务，而就这一事例与该剧来说，它只能是我军政策纪律教育斗争实践中一个实例，一个典型，一个方面，而不是唯一的实例和唯一的典型，和可以包括一切方面的，因此我们也不就应要求用一个实例和典型，一部剧本，来包括和解决我军政策纪律教育斗争实践上的全部任务，这一点，不管是对该剧的理解或对我们部队的实际生活来说，都很重要。（完）
