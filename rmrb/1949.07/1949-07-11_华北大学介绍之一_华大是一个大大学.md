　　An Introduction to North China University, Part 1
　　——“Hua University is a Big University”
　　Jin Feng
　　North China University was formed in 1948 through the merger of North China United University and Northern University. North China United University was itself formed by the successive union of Lu Xun Academy of Arts, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Public School, Wartime Youth Training Class, Workers' School, and other institutions. Lu Xun Academy of Arts, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Public School, and the Wartime Youth Training Class were all established when the Anti-Japanese War broke out. Northern University was also formed from many units.
　　"North China University is a big university" (as stated by President Wu Yuzhang), and this is true in every respect.
　　Its vertical growth process貫串了贯串了. From Yan'an to Beiping, Hua University's history distinctly marks the role played by Chinese intellectuals, in combination with workers and peasants, in various historical stages and different work posts since the Anti-Japanese War.
　　In 1937, when the high tide of the national liberation struggle swept across the Chinese mainland, tens of thousands of intellectuals walked out of classrooms, factories, and shops, and plunged into the national salvation movement, rushing to Yan'an, the holy land of anti-Japanese democracy. There, they entered Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Public School, Lu Xun Academy of Arts, Wartime Youth Training Class, Workers' School, and other institutions, beginning to transform passion into reason, and fanaticism into composure. Then, they set off again, standing on various work posts in the anti-Japanese struggle, becoming working cadres in the military, political, economic, and cultural fields throughout the twelve years from the Anti-Japanese War to the People's Liberation War.
　　In 1949, when the Chinese People's Liberation War was about to achieve nationwide victory, once again, more intellectuals consciously and thoroughly threw themselves into the revolutionary torrent, first rushing to Beiping, the red capital after liberation, and pouring into North China University. Here, they quickly discarded their backward ideologies and viewpoints, armed themselves with new and correct thoughts and positions, and became new talents, heading to the posts of political, economic, cultural, and national defense construction of the New Democracy. Ten years later, when new China is covered with the tall chimneys of factories, and vast farms are using new tractors, those glorious talents who have contributed their efforts and sweat to the construction of China will also loudly shout the name of "Hua University" everywhere.
　　From Yan'an to Beiping, from revolutionary war to peaceful construction, there must be several bridges to ferry the old intellectuals of old China, one by one, over to become a part of the great historical project of revolutionary construction of the new China, and Hua University is one of these bridges.
　　Turning the corrupt into strength is mainly because Hua University correctly implemented the Party's policy on transforming intellectuals and has transformed the intellectuals. The achievements are obvious. From August of last year to May of this year alone, 6,844 students have successively graduated from the First Division of Hua University. Among them, the most recent batch of 2,768 students enrolled in Beiping and attended classes in Zhengding. After studying for less than three months, they initially entered Hua University with all sorts of ideas, but now they have gone out with the same belief in serving the people.
　　As a work of building the people's education and culture, Hua University is cultivating talents in all aspects of revolutionary construction. Hua University is indeed a big university, with students ranging from university professors to middle school graduates. All students number approximately 13,000, divided into four divisions, two colleges, one institute, and one hall. The First Division is a political training class, with about 4,000 people in Beiping and about 4,000 people in Zhengding (a batch has recently graduated, and another batch has newly enrolled), and about 2,000 people in the Tianjin branch. The Second Division is the Education College in Beiping, with about 2,000 people, specializing in training and improving middle school teachers and other educational cadres. The Third Division is the Academy of Arts in Beiping, with about 1,000 people, specializing in training and improving cadres of people's literature and art. The Fourth Division is the Research Division, researching various academics and training university faculty. The two colleges are the Agricultural College and the Engineering College, both of which have made models of combining technology and theory with practice. The Agricultural College has close ties with the Ministry of Agriculture of the government, cultivating various cadres in veterinary medicine, agronomy, forestry, agricultural machinery, agricultural chemistry, and other fields. The Engineering College is in contact with the Enterprise Department, and students go to factories for internships, learning technology while getting close to workers, seeking a thorough transformation in their thinking. The Institute of Political Science is dedicated to professors and lecturers from universities in various regions to study politics and transform their thinking; the Translation Hall specializes in translating various foreign masterpieces and university textbooks.

　　华北大学介绍之一
    ——“华大是一个大大学”
    金凤
    华北大学在一九四八年由华北联大及北方大学合并而成，华北联大是先后由鲁迅艺术学院、陕北公学、战时青年训练班、工人学校等校联合而成。鲁艺、陕公、青训班等校都是在抗日战争爆发时成立的。北方大学也是由许多单位合成的。
    “华北大学是一个大大学”（吴玉章校长语），从各方面看来都是如此。
    贯串了它的纵的成长过程。，。从延安到北平，华大的历史鲜明地标志着中国知识分子从抗日战争以来与工农结合在各个不同历史阶段不同工作岗位上所起了的作用。
    一九三七年，当民族解放斗争的高潮冲击过中国大陆，成千成万的知识分子走出了课堂、工厂和商店，卷入了救亡运动，奔赴抗日民主圣地的延安，在那里他们进了陕北公学、鲁迅艺术学院、战时青年训练班、工人学校等，开始化激情为理智，变狂热为沉着，再出发，站到抗日的各种工作岗位上去，成为十二年来从抗日战争到人民解放战争中的军事、政治、经济、文化等各方面的工作干部。
    一九四九年，当中国人民解放战争将取得全国性胜利的一年，再一次，更多的知识分子更清醒自觉地投入革命的洪流，首先奔赴解放后的红色首都北平，涌入华北大学，在这里，他们很快地扔掉他们落后的思想观点，以新的正确的思想和立场武装自己，成为新的人才，到新民主主义的政治、经济、文化、国防等各项建设工作的岗位上去。十年后，当新中国已遍布工厂的高烟囱，广大农场应用着新式拖拉机的时候，那些遍布中国的光荣的为建设出力出汗的人才，他们也会到处响亮地喊出“华大”的名字来的。
    从延安到北平，从革命战争到和平建设，必须有若干座桥，把旧中国的旧知识分子，一个个渡过去，成为参与新中国革命建设的伟大历史工程的一分子，而华大便是这种桥梁之一。
    化腐朽为力量，这主要是由于华大正确地执行了党关于改造知识分子的政策改造了知识分子。成绩是显然的，仅从去年八月到今年五月，从华大第一部陆续毕业出去的学生就有六千八百四十四人，其中最近的一批二千七百六十八人是在北平入学到正定上课的，学习不到三个月，最初是带着各式各样的想法进华大来的，如今却已怀着同一的为人民服务的信念出去了。
    作为建设人民教育文化的工作，华大是培养着革命建设的各方面人才的。华大也确乎是一个大大学，学生包括了从大学教授到中学毕业生。全部学生约一万三千，分为四部两院一所一馆。第一部是政治训练班，在北平有四千人，正定约四千人（最近毕业了一批，又有一批新入学），天津分校约二千人。第二部是教育学院在北平，人数约二千，专门培养和提高中学的师资和其他教育干部。第三部是文艺学院在北平，人数约一千，专门培养和提高人民文艺的干部。第四部是研究部，研究各种学术，培养大学师资。两院是农学院和工学院，都作出了技术理论与实际结合的典范。农学院和政府农业部有密切的联系，培养兽医、有农艺、森林、农业机械、农业化学等各种干部。工学院则和企业部联系，学生要到工厂去实习，一面学习技术，一面与工人接近，求得思想上的彻底改造。一所是政治研究所，专为各地大学教授讲师研究政治，改造思想的；一馆是译学馆，专门翻译各种外国名著和大学教材。
