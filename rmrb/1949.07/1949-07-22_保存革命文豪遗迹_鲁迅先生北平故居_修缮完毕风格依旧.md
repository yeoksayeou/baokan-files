　　Preserving the Legacy of the Revolutionary Literary Giant
  　Lu Xun's Former Residence in Beiping
  　Renovated, Style Remains the Same
    [Beiping News] The North China Higher Education Commission decided to renovate Lu Xun's former residence in Beiping. Since work began on July 4th, all renovations were completed by the 20th. The great writer's former residence is located at No. 21, West Third Alley, Gongmenkou, Beiping. Due to years of disrepair, the house was dilapidated and leaked badly during rainy days. In order to preserve the legacy of the revolutionary giant, the North China Higher Education Commission decided to renovate it in late June. The North China People's Government allocated 200,000 People's Currency, and the renovation was carried out completely according to the original appearance of the residence. The colors of the paint and the paper used to paste the ceiling were kept as close to the original as possible. Therefore, everything at the site now maintains its original style. The Library and Cultural Relics Management Office of the North China Higher Education Commission has also collected more than 20 photos of Lu Xun's former residence, which will soon be displayed in the History Museum.

    【平市讯】华北高等教育委员会决定修缮北平鲁迅先生故居后，自七月四日开工以来，至二十日已全部修缮完竣。这位伟大文豪的故居，是北平宫门口西三条二十一号，因年久失修，房舍残旧，雨天渗漏不堪。为保存革命伟人遗迹，华北高教会于六月下旬决定加以修缮，华北人民政府当拨付人民券二十万元，完全按照先生故居的原样修缮，其油饰的色彩以及裱糊顶棚的纸张，尽可能使之照旧。因此，现在所有该处的一切，仍保持了原有的风格。现华北高教会图书文物管理处并收集了鲁迅故居的照片二十余帧，日内即可在历史博物馆陈列。
