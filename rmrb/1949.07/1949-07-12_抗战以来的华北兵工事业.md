The North China Ordnance Industry Since the War of Resistance

Liu Ding, Deputy Minister of the Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government

We have basically defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by imperialism. Our "ordnance production is one of the decisive factors in victory."

In the spring of 1938, we only produced dozens of spears per month. In 1949, excluding Peiping, Tianjin, and Taiyuan, we were producing 2,500 tons of munitions per month, requiring five trains to transport them to supply the North China People's Liberation Army. The defeated Kuomintang called our army a "sea of fire" tactic. These five trains of munitions could serve as the basis for the "sea of fire." Now, we are accepting the Party's call to convert ordnance to civilian industries, and are preparing entire trains of agricultural implements or railway equipment to supply the people's needs.

Such a great and hard-earned accumulation by the people, a complete set of heavy industries, including iron smelting, steelmaking, zinc smelting, coking, machine manufacturing, and chemical manufacturing. It brings together tens of thousands of peasants, tempered by ten years of experience, with a modern industrial production technical level, a heroic force that doesn't go to the battlefield. It possesses vast industrial equipment, basically all its own glorious creations, apart from confiscations and captures. Today, as we commemorate the 12th anniversary of the War of Resistance, in addition to celebrating our nationwide liberation victory, we also celebrate our acquisition of a valuable byproduct—a complete set of ordnance enterprises including tens of thousands of people!

How did it grow? Indeed, like the People's Liberation Army, it was nourished by blood and sweat, and went through many disasters, difficulties, sacrifices, and disabilities (here we must commemorate the deceased and disabled in our ordnance industry!).

Our workers only included a small number of ordnance repair workers from the Red Army era; workers from the Taiyuan Arsenal; some workers from "private" munitions businesses, railway and mine repair workers; and mostly local handicraft artisans, blacksmiths, carpenters, tinsmiths, silversmiths, kiln workers, saltpeter workers, paper makers, and firecracker makers. They were mostly sons of peasants, gradually trained over the past decade; in addition there were those liberated in the war... etc. Under the conscientious leadership of our Party and military and political leaders, they have been trained into a productive force over twelve years.

Our engineers were originally not ready-made ordnance engineers. They learned entirely from work, just like the commanders of the People's Liberation Army were forged in war. At the beginning they were only students, technicians, or general engineers, and, like other comrades who joined the People's Liberation Army, they had determination and enthusiasm. They came to the liberated areas in batches, crossed the reactionary lines to reach the liberated areas, and rushed back from enemy countries to resist Japan. In addition, our Party continuously sent batches of cadres to learn and work with them, first learning from the enemy, dismantling enemy shells and fuses that exploded on our heads, and experimenting at risk to make acids, fulminate of mercury, black powder, explosives, shells, and bombs, exploring manufacturing methods through sacrifices of health, limbs, and lives. At first, they were like Japanese and German students, and recently like American students (because of the structure and function of those countries' munitions), but they never received diplomas from Japanese, German, or American ordnance engineers!

Factory sites were chosen in various hidden environments, in the valleys of the Taihang Mountains, at the foot of the North Yue Heng Mountains, in village temples or civilian houses, underground in the Hebei Plain and in semi-open air cave dwellings, and around enemy strongholds, relying on natural terrain, the protection of the people, and our own flexible movement to achieve "indestructible, unexterminable". When the enemy attacked, a factory of two or three hundred people could be buried within a day and resume work within two days; small factories could hide in half a day and resume work in half a day. Taking the Huangyandong factory in the Taihang Mountains, which once had three thousand people, as an example, from 1939 to 1944, it was "swept" by the Japanese invaders fifteen times, buried and resumed work at least thirty times, which is thirty battles, or thirty "incidents." We not only heroically repelled the enemy's destructive "sweeps," but also produced countless cadre heroes and Communist Party members from them. Our Huangyandong Ordnance Factory was never destroyed and persisted. It still stands gloriously on the top of the Taihang Mountains today. Its old and simple machines continue their intensive production tasks. Every comrade or soldier who knows its name expresses joy when mentioning it.

Of course, these ordnance factories have been tempered for a long time, from scratch, from small to large, and in the struggle they have "turned from scattered to integrated, from integrated to scattered, and then from scattered to integrated again," going through three major stages. The production index naturally fluctuated. From 1939, the peak was in 1942, the lowest point in 1944, and the peak again in 1949, after which it greatly declined (because we didn't need it anymore). And each year it was "swept" by the Japanese invaders an average of three times, and production fluctuated greatly with small fluctuations, with an average of two months of work stoppage due to "sweeping" each year. But generally, they were able to complete twelve months of production tasks in ten months.

These ordnance factories all had their own complete set of production systems, production meeting system, production planning system, piecework wage system, inspection system, industrial affairs management system, and Party and government work system. When necessary, they used "shock work," "competition," etc. There were often affiliated schools, clubs, cooperatives, hospitals, and ordnance trade unions (industrial unions). The work there was intense, the discipline strict, superiors and subordinates were equal, and the military and the people were united. Generally, a ten-hour system was implemented, and a nine-hour system was implemented in some parts. The ordnance factory was like a school for peasants, where they received culture and technology. Ordnance workers were like the Eighth Route Army, helping peasants harvest during the busy farming season, and large numbers of peasants entered the factory to do short-term work during the slack season. During years of famine, the factory provided even greater assistance to the peasants. Here, the will of the Communist Party and the unity of workers and peasants were fully displayed. Because of this, the peasants cherished the factory as their own.

Our ordnance factory workers have had many amazing deeds in the twelve years of war.

Ordnance factory in the mountainous area - In October 1940, the Japanese invaders besieged the Huangyandong Ordnance Factory. The People's Liberation Army fought day and night on the mountain. In October 1941, when the Lianggou ordnance factory with nearly 2,000 people on the border of Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan was besieged by the Japanese invaders, all the workers and cadres participated in this defense battle for as long as three weeks. The workers in the factory fought day and night, and the workers also sent shells to the mountains at night.

In each "sweep" every year, workers actively participated in anti-sweeping, striking at the enemy. The workers' self-defense team first protected the factory, and then cooperated with the regular army to fight, and led the People's Liberation Army. Countless landmines of the workers' self-defense team protected the factory from destruction.

During the War of Resistance, large teams of workers were often organized to participate in road destruction, transporting rails into the mountains for preservation as steel materials.

Carefully study the burial of machines, and resume work quickly. Whoever can open and close quickly will have more opportunities to work.

During the "sweeping", in addition to the factory closing, a temporary ammunition supply station was organized. Because the sweeping lasted for more than two months, our People's Liberation Army needed temporary replenishment. Completely on-the-spot guerrilla warfare, the enemy cannot find it, and the Eighth Route Army can find it.

Ordnance factories in the plains - In the plain areas, the machinery repair shops of each sub-district, in 1940, the enemy's sweeping and dividing of the plains, several "strengthened public security" policies, and the implementation of the "blockhouse policy" in the Yizhong District, built blockhouse groups and road networks everywhere. Our main force transferred to the mountains, and only three to five workers were persistent in activities, and small armed forces in squads and platoons were active. Our workers also persisted in their work. They were divided into small groups scattered in an area, carrying their own weapons and tools, and maneuvering with the enemy day and night.

In tense situations, they hid during the day and set up stalls at night, and sometimes they had to transfer two or three times at night. This mobile small factory persisted for more than a year, guaranteeing the repair work for the armed soldiers and manufacturing hand grenades and landmines. Their actions were so rapid that they could start work in ten minutes and transfer in ten minutes, move over the enemy's surrounding villages and immediately carry out a battle to break through. They were not only workers, but also trained into very good soldiers.

In the plains, they were completely in a state of secret activity, creating new methods of tunnel warfare. Our workers quickly learned it, and began to dig their own tunnels, relying on the entrance of the cave to persist in production. As soon as the enemy came, they would drill into the cave to hide, and as soon as the enemy left, they would come out to work again. This reduced the number of transfers and extended the working time. They also built underground studios with their own hands, and moved the machine tool lathes underground. In the 8th Military Sub-district of Jizhong, a larger underground studio was built, with tunnels leading to the outside of the village, and fortifications to resist the enemy. The equipment in the cave was gradually perfected and safe, and the workers worked in shifts in the land five feet to one foot deep. The enemy was often making trouble in the village, and they were still working below. Because the secret was well kept, the underground factory developed and persisted until the situation improved again, and then moved back to the ground.

In another corner - Baiyangdian, relying on the "water", the enemy could not enter and a relatively large factory was established (more than 100 people working together). They all learned how to sail boats, and when the enemy suddenly came, they drilled into the dense reeds. At first, the machines and tools were installed on the boats so that they could be transferred at any time. Later, the enemy was unable to destroy this, and they built a factory in the village, using this pool as a base to establish two factories, repairing machines and making hand grenades, landmines, and reloading bullets, and also establishing a triacid factory to make their own yellow explosives and smokeless gunpowder. When the enemy "swept" Baiyangdian with steamboats, they quickly transferred to the reeds. All the workers mobilized to drive wooden piles to block the enemy's steamboats. As a result, the enemy steamboats were blocked by the wooden piles and leaked when touched and could not move forward. In winter, they organized to break the ice to keep the edge of the pond from freezing all winter. Therefore, they safely got the opportunity to produce. Although the periphery of the pond and the entire plain were controlled by enemy bunkers and highways and became underground activities, this group of workers still got the possibility of production. The factories of the two sub-districts (9th and 10th) and the Jizhong Military Region were rooted in Baiyangdian, and only reappeared on land to carry out new factory construction until the counter-offensive against Japan, combining the factories of the various sub-districts to form a larger factory.

As for production technology, we were very difficult under enemy blockade, and fought against difficulties every day. Every difficulty brought the danger of shutdown, but because of this, many miracles appeared in production technology, and many heroes appeared. Party members, branches, and trade unions played their due roles in these jobs.

Of course, we still have many shortcomings, such as serious empiricism, a great lack of political theory and natural science knowledge, and a strong peasant consciousness and peasant style, which are all worthy of great vigilance and transformation in the future. We believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will certainly be able to transform well.

　　抗战以来的华北兵工事业
    华北人民政府企业部副部长  刘鼎
    我们已经基本的战胜了有帝国主义支持的国民党反动派，我们的“兵工生产是胜利的决定因素之一”。
    一九三八年春，我们只月产几十支红缨枪，而一九四九年除平、津、太原以外我们已经月产二千五百吨军火，须用五个列车装运，供应华北解放军。战败的国民党称我军有“火海”战术，这五个列车的军火可以作为“火海”的根据。现在，我们接受党的号召把兵工转为民工，正准备整列车的农具或铁道器材供应人民的需要。
    这样伟大的人民的辛苦的积累，全套重工业，包括炼铁炼钢炼锌炼焦，机器制造，化学制造。它集结了若干万农民，受了十年的锻炼，具有近代工业生产技术水准，是一支不上战场的英雄部队。它拥有浩大的产业的装备，除了征发和缴获者外，基本上全是他们自己光荣的创造。今天我们纪念抗战的十二周年，除了庆祝我们全国解放的胜利，同时我们也庆祝我们获得宝贵的附产物——包含几万人的全套兵工企业！
    它是怎样生长出来的呢？确实是同解放军一样，由血和汗滋养成的，经过了不少的灾难、困难、牺牲、残废（这里必须纪念我们兵工中的牺牲者和残废者！）。
    我们的工人只有极少数红军时代的修械工人；太原兵工厂的工人；部分“私”军火工人、铁路和矿山的修理工人；大部是地方上的手工业工匠、铁匠、木匠、锡匠、银匠、窑工、硝工、纸工、爆竹工；他们大部是农民子弟，在十年当中逐渐训练成的；另外还有战争中解放出来的………等等十二年功夫在我党及军政首长兢兢业业的领导下已经锻炼成生产的部队了。
    我们的工程师原来没有一个是现成的兵工工程师，他们完全是从工作中学成的，如同解放军的指挥员一样是从战争中打出来的。开始他们只是学生、技工或一般工程师，他们与其他参加解放军的同志一样，有决心，有热情。他们有整批来解放区的，有通过反动派防线到解放区的，有从敌国赶回来抗战的。加上我党不断地整批地送来干部，和他们一块儿学着做，首先向敌人学习，拆卸敌人打到我们头上来爆炸的炮弹和引信，冒险试制，制酸，制雷汞，制黑药，制炸药，制炮弹，制炸弹，从健康、肢体、生命的牺牲中探取制法。他们开始好象日德留学生，最近又好象美国留学生（因为他们那些国家军火的构造和作用），不过他们从来没有得过日德美兵工工程师的文凭！
    厂址采取在各种隐蔽的环境中，太行山的山谷中，北岳恒山的山脚边，村庄的庙宇里或民房里，河北平原的地下以及半露天半窑洞，以及敌人据点的周围，靠天然地形，靠人民保护，靠我们自己灵活的运动，做到“打不死，消不灭”。在敌人进攻时，二三百人的工厂在一天以内埋藏起来，两天以内复工；小的工厂半天隐藏，半天复工。以太行山黄烟洞一个曾经有过三千人的工厂来说，从一九三九年到一九四四年被日寇“扫荡”十五次，埋藏和复工共计至少三十次，就是三十次的战斗，或者三十次的“事变”。我们不但英勇地迎击了敌人毁灭性的“扫荡”，而且我们从中涌现了无数干部英雄和共产党员，我们黄烟洞的兵工厂始终未被消灭，撑掌出来了，它直到现在仍然光荣地屹立在太行山的顶上。它的太老、太简陋的机器现在仍然继续着它紧张的生产任务。每一个知道它的同志或战士提及它的名字，都表现欣慰。
    当然这些兵工厂久经锻炼，从无到有，从小到大，而且在斗争中曾经“化零为整，化整为零，又化零为整”，经过了三大阶段。中间生产指数当然在波动中，从一九三九年起，一九四二年到最高峰，一九四四年为最低点，一九四九年又到最高峰，此后却又大大下降（因为我们不需要了）。而每年平均三次被日寇“扫荡”时，生产又在大波动中起伏着小波动，每年平均两个月因“扫荡”而停工。但一般均能在十个月内完成十二个月的生产任务。
    这些兵工厂都有着自己整个一套的生产制度，生产会议制，生产计划制，按件工资制，检验制，工务管理制，党政工作制。必要时用上“突击”“竞赛”……等。经常有附属的学校，俱乐部，合作社，医院和兵工工会（产业工会）。在那里劳动紧张，纪律严明，上下平等，军民团结。一般实行十小时制，部分实行九小时制。兵工厂就好象农民的学校，他们在这里得到文化和技术。兵工工人好象八路军部队一样农忙时帮助农民收获，而农闲时农民大批入厂打短工。度荒年时工厂对农民帮助更大。这里完全呈显了共产党的意志，工农的团结。正因为如此，农民爱护工厂如同自己的工厂。
    我们兵工厂工人在十二年战争中曾经有过不少惊人事迹。
    山岳区的兵工厂——一九四○年十月，日寇围攻黄烟洞兵工厂，解放军在山上不分昼夜地顶着打，一九四一年十月在冀晋豫的边界梁沟近二千人的兵工厂被日寇围攻时，全体工人干部参加了这一次的防卫战达三个星期之久。工人在厂里不分昼夜地顶着做，工人还在夜里向山上送炮弹。
    每年每次“扫荡”中都有工人积极参加反扫荡，打击敌人的，工人自卫队首先保卫工厂，其次配合正规军打仗，给解放军带路。工人自卫队的地雷无数地保卫了工厂免于破毁。
    抗战中经常组织大队工人参加破路，将铁轨运进山地保存当为钢料使用。
    精密研究埋藏机器，又要迅速复工，谁能快开快关，谁就得多做工的机会。
    在“扫荡”时除工厂关门外，另组织临时的弹药供应站。因为扫荡时间长到两个月以上，我解放军就需要临时补充。完全就地游击，敌人来找不着，八路军来就找得着。
    平原地的兵工厂——在平原地区各分区的修械所，在一九四○年敌人对平原的扫荡分割、几次的“强化治安”实行“碉堡政策”，在翼中区遍地建立碉楼群公路网。我部队主力转移到山地，只有三五成群的工作人员在坚持活动和以班排为单位的小股武装活动。我们的工人也在坚持着工作，他们分成小组散在一个区域里，带着自己的武装及工具与敌人昼夜周旋。
    他们在紧张的情况下白天隐蔽，夜间便拉开摊子作工，有时夜间还要转移两三次。这样游动式的小工厂坚持了一年多的时间，他们保证了为武装战士的修械工作与制造着手榴弹和地雷，他们动作的迅速可以在十分钟里开工、十分钟内转移，迁过敌人包围村庄便立即进行战斗突围，他们不仅是工人而且锻炼成了很好的战士。
    在平原上已完全处在秘密活动状态，创造了地道斗争的新方法，我们的工友们也很快的学会了，开始使自己挖好地道，依靠洞口，坚持生产，敌人一来便钻入洞中隐蔽起来，敌人一走便又出来作工，这样便减少了转移的次数使工作时间延长了。他们又以自己的手建造了地下的工作室，把机器车床搬到地下去，在冀中八分区便建造了一个规模较大的地下工作室，里面有地道可达村外，有防御工事可抵御敌人，洞中的设备日臻完善与安全，工友们便分班的在地下五尺——一丈深的土地里面作工，敌人往往在村里闹着，他们还在下面工作。由于保守秘密很好，所以地下工厂便发展起来与坚持到最后情况的好转，又重新搬到地上面来。
    在另外一个角落里——白洋淀，依靠着“水”，敌人无法进入而建立了规模比较大的工厂（一百多人在一起工作），他们都学会了驾船的本领，敌人突来便钻入深密的苇地里，初时把机器工具都按装在船上，以便能随时转移，后来敌人对此终无法破坏，他们又在村中建厂，以此淀为基地建立了两个工厂，修械及造手榴弹地雷和复装子弹，并又建立三酸工厂自制黄色炸药与无烟火药。当敌人以汽船“扫荡”白洋淀时，他们便很迅速的转入苇地里去，工友全部动员起来，下木桩以阻敌人汽艇，结果敌人汽艇因木桩之阻，触之即漏无法前进。冬季便组织起来破冰，维持淀边经冬不结冻。因而他们安全的得到生产的机会，虽然淀的周围及整个平原为敌碉堡公路所控制而成地下活动状态，但这一批的工友仍然得到生产的可能，两个分区（第九第十）与冀中军区的工厂都在白洋淀按下了根基，直至对日反攻时方又重现于陆路进行新的建厂，把各分区的工厂合组起来成为规模较大的工厂。
    至于生产技术方面，在被敌封锁情况下，我们十分困难，每日在向困难作斗争，每件困难都带来停工的危险，但是正因为如此，在生产技术上出现了不少奇迹，出现了不少英雄。党员、支部、工会就在这些工作中，均发挥了它们应有的作用。
    当然我们还存在着很多缺点，如严重的经验主义，大大缺乏政治理论和自然科学知识，以及浓厚的农民意识农民作风，均值得今后大大警惕与改造。我们相信，在毛主席的领导下，我们也一定能改造好的。
