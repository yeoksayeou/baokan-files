　　Go to the Places Where the Revolution Needs You Most!
  　5,000 Graduates of North China University Will Soon Go to Work in the Northwest and Jiangnan
    [Our Newspaper] More than five thousand students from six districts of the first division of North China University are about to graduate and go to various work posts. In the past three months, they have studied the History of Social Development, On New Democracy, Introduction to the Chinese Communist Party, specific policies, etc., listened to special reports by Comrade Bo Yibo, Mr. Guo Moruo, etc., carried out ideological revolution movements and revolutionary work style competition movements, liquidated backward ideas, and cooperated with study visits to factories, rural areas, and troops, and watched revolutionary movies and dramas. They invited labor heroes, village cadres, and combat heroes to give lectures, recognized and criticized past erroneous ideas such as belittling working people and planning for personal and family prospects, and changed their past free and undisciplined work style. They initially established a revolutionary outlook on life and a revolutionary work style, and possessed the minimum conditions for being a revolutionary cadre. When Vice Principal Cheng announced the work areas in the fifth and sixth districts, calling on students to go to the Northwest and Jiangnan to liberate all of China, the students warmly supported and responded to this call. Party members, League members, student unions, and activists took the lead in posting slogans, publishing wall newspapers, and holding discussion meetings. Many students said: "In the past, I thought Jiangnan needed cadres the most, so I asked to go south. Now I know that the Northwest is more important, so I won't go south. I want to go to the Northwest!" "Go to the places where the revolution needs you most!" has become the unanimous slogan of all comrades!
