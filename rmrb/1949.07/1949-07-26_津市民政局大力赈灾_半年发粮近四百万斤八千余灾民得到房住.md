Tianjin Civil Affairs Bureau Vigorously Provides Disaster Relief
	Nearly Four Million Jin of Grain Distributed in Half a Year, Over Eight Thousand Disaster Victims Housed

[Our Newspaper Tianjin Dispatch] The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau has achieved good results in its work of providing relief to disaster victims who suffered from the Kuomintang bandit gang's frantic plunder and destruction over the past six months. As of the end of June, the bureau had distributed a total of 3,729,984.5 jin of disaster relief grain, benefiting 353,156 disaster victims (accounting for about one-sixth of the city's population). In addition to the above grain distribution, the method of "work-for-relief" was implemented in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 10th, and 11th districts, totaling 15,696 workdays, equivalent to 64,278 jin of grain. During the Tianjin Campaign, a considerable number of houses in the suburbs of the city were burned down by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. The municipal government recently submitted a request to the North China People's Government for a loan of 75,278,910 yuan from the People's Bank of China (equivalent to 1,571,885 jin of millet), and organized a large number of cadres to form district and street construction guidance committees based on the specific conditions of each district and street. This work was completed before the rainy season (end of June). A total of 2,451.5 rooms were repaired, providing housing for 1,737 households with 8,422 people. Secondly, the bureau repatriated or sent to other regions a total of 29,530 foreign residents scattered in the city, issuing 964 free tickets and 1,293,765 yuan in travel expenses. Thousands of people from the Northeast who were deceived into entering the customs by the Kuomintang were not only assisted in returning to their hometowns but were also given strong relief. According to statistics from January to April alone, a total of 24,500 jin of grain was distributed, benefiting 3,935 people. In order to solve the unemployment problem in Tianjin, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau specially established a job placement service under the Social Service Office. From March 21st to the beginning of July, the office has helped more than 1,100 people obtain employment.
