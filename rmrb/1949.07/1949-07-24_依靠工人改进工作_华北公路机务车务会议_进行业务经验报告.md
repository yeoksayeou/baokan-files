　　Relying on Workers to Improve Work
　　North China Highway Mechanical and Vehicle Affairs Meeting
　　Conducts Business Experience Reports
　　[Our Newspaper News] The North China Highway Transportation Mechanical and Vehicle Affairs Meeting, from the 19th to the 23rd, listened to business experience reports from automobile companies and factories in Shijiazhuang, Beiping, Tianjin, Chahar, Shanxi, and Handan. In their reports, one important issue was clearly running through: that is, only by closely relying on the worker masses, implementing democratic management, giving play to the workers' enthusiasm and creativity, and launching production competitions, can production and business be smoothly developed. Comrade Fang Shidao, director of the Shijiazhuang Transportation Factory, said in his report: The factory was originally a factory manufacturing paper making, water conservancy, and other machinery. Due to work and task needs, it was completely converted into an automobile parts manufacturing factory in May of this year. However, before this happened, the worker masses were not well mobilized, the reasons for the conversion to parts manufacturing were not explained, and the workers' ideological concerns were not eliminated. Therefore, the workers' emotions were uneasy: they were not familiar with the new production technology, they did not have the confidence to research and improve new machine tools and working methods, the production quality could not be improved, and the factory's business could not be developed. In mid-May, under the leadership of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee, the factory strengthened worker education, improved workers' political consciousness, and launched production competitions, making the working class believe in their own great creativity. First, worker Li Chaoyuan of the machinist group improved the tool for the plane of the snap ring and achieved victory. Workers He Hongfu and other twelve people then automatically established a technical research association. Technical personnel saw the workers' creativity and also humbly learned from the workers, specifically helping the workers to improve their technical level. Technical personnel and workers were practically combined, greatly increasing production quality. In May and June, the tools they successfully improved included: piston eye turning, chamfering of both ends of the piston pin, milling of the snap ring opening, and improved the procedure for snap ring work; they created a new cylinder working method, increasing the original capacity of only three cylinders per day to five. Because they increased production quality and reduced costs, they increased their income by 22,000 jin of millet in May and June.

　　依靠工人改进工作
  　华北公路机务车务会议
  　进行业务经验报告
    【本报讯】华北公路运输机务车务会议，从十九日至二十三日止，连日听取石家庄、北平、天津、察哈尔、山西、邯郸等地汽车公司、工厂的业务经验报告。在他们的报告中，明显的贯串着一个重要问题：就是只有紧紧的依靠工人群众，实行民主管理，发挥工人的积极性与创造性，展开生产竞赛，生产与业务才能顺利展开。石家庄交通工厂厂长方世道同志在报告中说：该厂原系制造造纸、水利等机器的工厂，由于工作和任务的需要，在本年五月份全部改成制造汽车配件厂。但在事前没有很好的动员工人群众，说明改制配件的原因，消除工人思想上的顾虑，因此使得工人情绪不安：对于新的生产技术不熟悉，没有信心去研究与改进新的机器工具与工作方法，生产质量不能提高，工厂业务无法展开。五月中旬，该厂在石家庄市委的领导下，加强工人教育，提高工人政治觉悟，展开生产竞赛，使工人阶级相信了自己的伟大创造力。首先机工股工人李朝元改进涨圈平面工具，获到了胜利。工人何洪福等十二人接着自动成立了技术研究会，技术人员看到了工人的创造力，也虚心的向工人学习，具体帮助工人提高技术水平，技术人员与工人实际结合起来，大大增进了生产质量。在五六两个月中，他们改进成功的工具计有：活塞旋眼、活塞轴两端稍口、涨圈铣口，并改进涨圈工作的程序；创造新的缸筒工作法，使原来每天只能做三个缸筒的，增加到五个。由于他们增进生产质量，和减低成本，在五六两月内，增加了两万二千斤小米的收入。
