The North China People's Government Ministry of Agriculture Invites Experts to Discuss North China Farmland Irrigation

[Ping City News] The North China People's Government Ministry of Agriculture convened a symposium on the development of farmland irrigation in the North China region at Tsinghua University on the morning of the 5th. Attendees included Vice Minister Zhang Chong of the Ministry of Agriculture, Dean Shi Jiayang of the Tsinghua Engineering College, professors from Peking University and Tianjin Beiyang University, and water conservancy experts from the North China Water Conservancy Commission, totaling more than twenty people. First, Chairman Shi Jiayang explained the significance of the meeting and issues related to water conservancy data collection, investigation, engineering design, and personnel training. Then, Zhang Zilin, Director of the Farmland Irrigation Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, reported on the construction of farmland irrigation in North China and put forward concrete suggestions for the development goals of water conservancy next year. In areas such as Chahar, Jinzhong, Jidong, Suiyuan, and Jizhong, large-scale irrigation projects are planned to be built; in the vast plains of Hebei, waterwheels and wells will be developed on a large scale. The meeting then began discussions, unanimously emphasizing that the development of water conservancy construction is of particular importance to agricultural production in the North China region, which suffers from drought nine years out of ten. Extensive exchanges of views were conducted on engineering technology aspects such as dam construction, reservoir storage, and standardization of water conservancy machinery. Finally, preliminary and concrete suggestions were made on organizing inspections of projects to be built in various places and assisting in design, establishing hydrological stations and water level stations, and collecting underground hydrological data. During the meeting, participants visited the siphon waterway experiment at the Beiping Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory and watched films on agricultural irrigation and agricultural machinery presented by the Department of Mechanical Engineering.
