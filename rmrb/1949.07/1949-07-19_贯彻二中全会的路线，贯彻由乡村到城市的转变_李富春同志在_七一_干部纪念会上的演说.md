The anniversary of the birth of the Communist Party of China – this year's "July 1st" – arrives amidst the great victory of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, in overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The Chinese people's own armed forces – the People's Liberation Army, after three years of heroic revolutionary war, having annihilated 5,690,000 reactionary Kuomintang troops, are now advancing southward and northwestward in a great march unprecedented in Chinese history. The final elimination of the remaining enemies is not far off. The basic tasks of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution – opposing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, eliminating the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and establishing a People's Democratic Republic – are nearing complete victory. This victory is great. The Communist Party of China has led the people of the whole country in arduous struggle for twenty-eight years, and with the help of the working people of the world, the Chinese people have finally achieved this victory. This is the result of the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao.

The whole country has entered a new period of construction, and our entire Party will face an even greater and more glorious task: the task of building a new China economically and culturally. We must not take this task lightly. Our victory nationwide is only the first act of the entire people's liberation cause. To transform semi-feudal and semi-colonial China into an independent, self-reliant, prosperous, and strong new China, to transform backward agricultural China into advanced industrial China, and to move towards the path of socialist development, is a more complex, more arduous, and longer-term struggle. This task is more complex and arduous because the country's industry is not very developed, with industry accounting for only 10% of the total national economy, while agriculture and handicrafts account for 90%. "This is the result of the oppression of China by imperialism and feudalism. This is the economic form of old China as a semi-colony and semi-feudal society. This is the basic starting point for all problems during the Chinese revolution and for a considerable period after the victory of the revolution. From this point of departure arise a series of strategic, tactical, and policy issues for our Party." In addition, it must be recognized that even within this 90% of agriculture and handicrafts, only areas with a population of 150 million have undergone land reform. In areas with a population of over 320 million, the rural land system is still basically feudal, and it will take arduous work to resolve this.

This task is more complex and arduous. We must also particularly recognize that the main obstacle to the Chinese people's construction of a new China is imperialism. Old China was a semi-colonial country controlled by imperialism. The thorough anti-imperialist nature of the Chinese people's democratic revolution has made the imperialists extremely hostile to this revolution. Not only did they do their utmost to help the Kuomintang cruelly oppose the Chinese people during the people's revolution, but even after the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, Chairman Mao recently emphatically warned us: "Imperialism and its running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their defeat on this land of China. They will collude with each other even more and use all possible means to oppose the Chinese people." Therefore, we must understand that in uniting the people of the whole country to build a new China, we must be vigilant and oppose any conspiracy or interference by imperialism. This is a major task of struggle. In particular, the people of the entire Northeast and the cadres of the entire Party must never think that, now that the entire Northeast is liberated, imperialism and the remaining forces of the reactionaries can do nothing, and thus become complacent, lax, or even indulge in peaceful enjoyment. This kind of thinking that forgets the enemy, or the view that the forces of imperialism and the remaining forces of the reactionaries are no longer the main enemy, is completely wrong. This is the main source of the right-leaning tendencies within the Party in the Northeast. In various parts of the Northeast, whether in cities or villages, those who are carrying out sabotage, disruption, and attempts to overturn the situation are precisely the conspiratorial activities of imperialism combined with the remaining forces of feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism. Chairman Mao has long instructed us: The enemies with guns have been eliminated, but the enemies without guns still exist and are using every means to carry out a desperate struggle. The whole Party must be vigilant, and must lead the people in the cities and villages to resolutely eliminate the remaining forces of the reactionaries, smash all the conspiracies of imperialism, and carry the revolution through to the end! (⑴⑵)

This task is more complex and arduous because we still lack knowledge and experience in managing and building the country. We must learn humbly, we must delve into new businesses and new tasks, become familiar with them, and master them. We must learn from those who understand, unite with non-Party cadres from all sides, learn from them humbly on the one hand, and help them to progress on the other. We must learn even more from the Soviet Union, learning from the Soviet Union's successful and advanced experience.

To complete the task of building the Northeast, the Party in the Northeast must correctly implement the line of the Second Plenary Session of the Party. The Second Plenary Session instructed us: The Party must earnestly unite the entire working class, the entire peasant class, and the broad revolutionary intellectuals, as well as unite as many petty bourgeois and liberal bourgeois elements as possible who can cooperate with the Communist Party, to form a strong and consolidated united front, carry the revolution through to the end, thoroughly overthrow the domestic counter-revolutionary forces, and jointly build a new China. The Second Plenary Session further instructed us: Under the current situation of nationwide victory, the work of the entire Party should undergo a historic shift. The focus of work must shift from the countryside to the cities, with the cities leading the countryside, taking into account both urban and rural areas, closely integrating industry and agriculture, and the workers and peasants forming a solid alliance. In urban work, the Party must take production and construction as the center, and all other work must revolve around this center. Our general policy for economic construction is the policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, promoting mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and promoting internal and external exchange," as Chairman Mao said. We must use Chairman Mao's "four-way" policy to review and improve our work, and deeply recognize that if we neglect one aspect of the "four-way" policy, we will make serious mistakes. In Northeast industry, the proportion of public industry is greater than that of private industry. Our first task is to restore and develop public industry. We must strive to make public enterprises very good so that they can truly lead the entire national economy forward; however, we should never neglect the protection and possible development of private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood simply because the proportion of private industry is smaller than that of public industry. Because the Northeast is still only a semi-industrialized and semi-agricultural region, and it is economically and politically integrated with the rest of the country, and the level of industry in the rest of the country is even lower than in the Northeast, in order to gradually industrialize the Northeast and thereby promote the process of industrialization throughout the country, in addition to making the greatest efforts to improve public industry, we must also guide and give play to the enthusiasm of private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, we should take effective measures to restrict and ban speculative and disruptive unscrupulous merchants and all behaviors that disrupt national construction economically, in order to implement the policy of taking into account both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital in all aspects, and to implement it in labor policies, tax policies, trade policies, and industrial policies.

If we want to correctly implement the line of the Second Plenary Session without making mistakes, in addition to resolutely and correctly implementing the Party's policies, we must also change our working style. Therefore, I will especially talk about this issue, which is what we often say: do not use the outdated set of rural working styles to engage in urban work and industrial construction, but rather require the establishment of a new working style suitable for the new situation and new tasks. So, what exactly is the outdated rural style, and what is the new style suitable for national scale and urban work and industrial construction? In summary, there are four points:

First, the past was rural, dispersed, and relatively autonomous, but today it is national in scale, centralized, and unified.

In the past, we worked and lived in the countryside for a long time. The areas were dispersed, and due to the war, they were divided. Therefore, each area had considerable independence and autonomy. But now the environment has changed. The Northeast has been completely liberated, and the whole country will soon be completely liberated. Cities and villages, here and there, are already and are in the process of forming a whole. Our task is to manage a unified country and build a unified country, which requires complete centralization. It is no longer acceptable to be so dispersed and autonomous. It is absolutely impermissible to depart from the local and temporary perspective and only plan from the local standpoint. If so, it would be to divide the whole country, which would be an anarchic state of no organization and no discipline. For example, in terms of organizational forms, everything in the city is centralized, and urban work should be centralized in the city. However, we still establish district and street administrations according to the methods of the countryside, and disperse work layer by layer, which is equivalent to dividing the entire centralized and unified city into countless pieces.

To manage and build a unified people's country well, we must implement the principle of centralization and unification, strictly achieve consistency in thought, organization, and action, and strictly pay attention to labor efficiency and a sense of responsibility. Therefore, there must be clearly defined rewards and punishments, and strictly enforced laws, systems, and disciplines that protect unity. Therefore, we must strengthen the proletarian collectivist ideology and the overall concept within the Party, and earnestly overcome the individualistic ideology and localist viewpoints of small producers. On this issue, the understanding of some cadres within the Party is still not profound, and the struggle to strengthen the opposition to tendencies of disorganization and indiscipline has not been implemented and thoroughly deepened in all aspects. Recent incidents in the Northeast involving dereliction of duty, corruption, waste of state property, etc., by some cadres, we have not taken a more serious attitude towards these incidents, have not strictly enforced Party discipline and government laws, and still hold inappropriate views of accommodating cadres. The result is that it becomes condoning and indulgence, which not only fails to make our ranks neat and in unison, concentrating our efforts to overcome difficulties, but also greatly harms the construction of the people's country.

    贯彻二中全会的路线，贯彻由乡村到城市的转变
    李富春同志在“七一”干部纪念会上的演说
    中国共产党诞生第二十八周年的纪念日——今年的“七一”，是在中国共产党领导下的人民解放军和中国人民打垮了国民党反动统治的伟大胜利形势下来到的。中国人民自己的武装——人民解放军，在历经三年的英勇革命战争，消灭了反动的国民党军五百六十九万人之后，现在正向南方和西北，执行着自有中国历史以来未曾有过的大进军。最后肃清残余的敌人，已经为期不远了。中国新民主主义革命的基本任务，反对帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义，消灭国民党的反动统治，建立人民民主主义共和国，已经接近于完全胜利。这个胜利是伟大的。中国共产党领导全国人民艰苦奋斗二十八年，在全世界劳动人民的帮助之下，中国人民终于获得了这个胜利。这是以毛主席为首的党中央正确领导的结果。
    全国已进入一个新的建设时期，我们全党将面临一个更伟大更光荣的任务，在经济上文化上建设新中国的任务。我们不要把这一任务看得容易，我们取得全国胜利还只是整个人民解放事业的第一幕，要想把半封建半殖民地的中国，变成独立、自主、繁荣、富强的新中国，把落后的农业中国变成先进的工业中国，并走向社会主义的发展道路，这是一个更复杂、更艰苦、更长期的斗争。这个任务之所以更复杂、更艰苦，是因为全国的工业还不很发达，工业在全部的国民经济中的比重，只占百分之十，而农业手工业却占百分之九十。“这是帝国主义制度和封建制度压迫中国的结果，这是旧中国表现为半殖民地和半封建社会的经济形态，这是在中国革命时期内及在革命胜利以后一个相当长的时期内一切问题的基本出发点，从这点出发产生了我党一系列的战略上策略上的和政策上的问题。”另外还要看到即在此百分之九十的农业手工业中，经过土地改革的还只有包括一万五千万人口的地区，还有三万万二千余万人口的地区，农村土地基本上还是封建制度，这还要经过艰苦的工作，才能解决。
    这个任务之所以更复杂、更艰苦，我们还必须特别认识中国人民建设新中国的阻力，主要是帝国主义。旧中国是一个被帝国主义控制的半殖民地国家，中国人民民主革命的彻底的反帝国主义性质，使得帝国主义者极为仇视这个革命，不仅在人民革命中竭尽全力地帮助国民党残酷地反对中国人民，即在中国人民革命胜利后，毛主席最近着重地警惕我们说：“帝国主义及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败是不会甘心的，他们还会更互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。”因此，我们必须懂得在团结全国人民建设新中国中，要警惕与反对帝国主义的任何阴谋、任何干涉，这是一个主要的斗争任务。特别全东北的人民，与全党干部决不要以为全东北解放了，帝国主义与反动派的残余势力无所作为了，因而麻痹、松懈，甚至太平享乐，这种忘记了敌人的思想，或者以为帝国主义势力与反动派残余势力已经不是主要敌人的观点完全是错误的，这是东北党内右倾偏向主要危险的根源。在东北各地，无论城市与乡村，进行捣乱、破坏与翻把的，正是帝国主义与封建主义、官僚资本主义残余势力结合起来的阴谋活动。毛主席早已指示我们：拿枪的敌人消灭了，不拿枪的敌人还存在，还用尽一切方法来进行拚死的挣扎，全党必须警惕，而且必须领导城市与乡村的人民坚决的肃清反动派的残余势力，粉碎帝国主义的一切阴谋，将革命进行到底！（⑴⑵）
    这个任务之所以更复杂更艰苦，是由于我们对管理国家与建设国家还缺乏知识与经验，我们必须虚心学习，必须对新的业务新的工作钻进去，熟悉他，掌握他。必须向懂的人去学习，团结各方面的非党干部，一方面向他们虚心学，一方面帮助他们的进步。我们更要向苏联学习，学习苏联胜利的先进的经验。
    东北党要完成建设东北的任务，就必须正确贯彻执行党的二中全会的路线，二中全会指示我们：党必须认真地团结全体工人阶级，全体农民阶级和广大的革命知识分子，以及团结尽可能多的能够与共产党合作的小资产阶级和自由资产阶级分子，结成一个坚强巩固的统一战线，将革命进行到底，彻底打倒国内的反革命势力，共同建设新中国。二中全会更指示我们：在目前全国胜利形势下，全党的工作应该有一个历史性的大转变。工作重心必须由乡村移到城市，由城市来领导乡村，城乡兼顾，工业与农业密切结合，工人与农民要结成巩固的联盟。党在城市工作中，要以生产建设为中心，其他一切工作要围绕这个中心来进行。我们经济建设的总方针，即是毛主席所说的，“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利，城乡互助，内外交流”的方针。我们要以毛主席的“四面八方”的方针，检讨与改进我们的工作，深刻认识“四面八方”中忽视了一方面，我们就要犯严重的错误。东北工业中公营工业的比重比私人工业大，我们第一是应当恢复与发展公营工业，我们必须努力把公营企业搞的很好，使其真正能够领导整个国民经济前进；但决不应因为私人工业比公营工业的比重小而忽视了有利于国计民生的私人工业的保护与可能的发展。由于东北也还只是一个半工业化半农业化的地区，它在经济上、政治上与全国又是结成一体的，而全国工业水平较东北尤低，为了有步骤地使东北达到工业化，并从而推进全国工业化的进程起见，我们除以最大的努力搞好公营工业之外，同时我们必需引导与发挥有利于国计民生的私人企业的积极性，但对于投机捣把的不正当的奸商及一切从经济上捣乱国家建设的行为，则应采取有效办法，予以限制与取缔，以贯彻公私兼顾劳资两利的方针到各个方面去，贯彻到劳动政策、税收政策、贸易政策及工业政策上去。
    我们要想正确地贯彻执行二中全会的路线，不犯错误，除了坚决而正确的贯澈党的政策外，还必需转变我们的工作作风。因此我特别讲讲这个问题，这就是我们时常说的，不要拿农村的不合时宜的一套旧作风来搞城市工作与工业建设，而要求建立适合于新情况新任务的新作风。那么，到底什么是过时的农村作风，什么又是适合于全国规模与城市工作、工业建设的新作风呢？概括起来有四点：
    第一、过去是农村分散，相对自主，今天则是国家规模，集中统一。
    过去我们长期在农村中间工作与生活，地区是分散的，而且由于战争的缘故，是被分割的，所以每个地区有相当的独立自主性。但是现在环境变了，东北已经完全解放，同时全国即将全部解放，城市与乡村，此地与彼地，已经和正在结成一个整体，我们的任务已是要管理一个统一的国家，建设一个统一的国家完全需要集中，再那样分散自主就不行了，决不可从一地一时的局部出发仅仅从本地打算了，如果这样就是把全国分割，就是无组织无纪律无政府状态了。比方在组织形式上，城市一切是集中的，城市的工作应集中于市，但是我们还依照农村的办法建立区街政权，把工作层层分散，这就等于把整个集中统一的城市分为无数块。
    要管理好与建设好一个统一的人民国家，就必须贯彻集中统一的原则，严格作到思想上组织上行动上的一致，严格的讲求劳动效率，与负责精神，因此就必须有赏罚分明的，保护统一的严格遵行的法令、制度与纪律，因此，我们一定要加强党内的无产阶级集体主义思想与整体观念，认真克服小生产者的个人主义思想与本位主义观点，在这问题上，党内有些干部认识仍是不深刻的，对加强反对无组织无纪律偏向的斗争还没有贯彻和认真深入到各方面去，最近东北所发生的一些干部渎职，贪污腐化，浪费国家财产等等事件，我们对这些事件还没有采取更严肃的态度，没有严格执行党纪与政府法令，还存在不适当的迁就干部的观点，结果是变成纵容和姑息，这样不但不能使我们的队伍整齐起来步调一致，集中力量克服困难，而且对人民国家的建设事业危害甚大。（未完）
