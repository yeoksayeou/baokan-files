Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. The CCP Central Committee East China Bureau, in view of the rapid rise of the Yangtze River water level and the precarious situation in the areas along the river in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, with some sections having already breached and caused disasters, the severity of which is unprecedented since 1931, issued instructions on flood prevention and rescue to its subordinate party committees at all levels on the 11th of this month. The instructions require all localities to earnestly implement the following points:

(1) In all areas along rivers and lakes where floods may strike or have already struck, party committees at all levels must take flood prevention, dike protection, and disaster rescue as the current urgent and central tasks of combat. They must quickly establish and strengthen flood prevention and rescue organizations, mobilize the party, government, army, and all the people, unify leadership, assign responsibilities by sections, focus forces, and launch surprise rescue efforts in the most critical areas, and fully organize reserve forces so that they can be continuously投入 into the rescue when necessary.

(2) In dike protection and rescue, leading cadres must take responsibility and lead the way, clarify responsibilities, enforce strict discipline, and hold each section of the embankment area responsible for ensuring the safety of the dike at a certain water level. Otherwise, if rescue efforts are inadequate and a breach occurs, the party committee and government in that area will be held responsible. Conversely, those who complete the rescue task will be rewarded. Cadres responsible for dike protection must lead the masses, work tirelessly day and night, fully promote the spirit of sharing life and death and hardships with the people, and prevent the emergence of localistic tendencies that only care about their own area and disregard the overall situation.

(3) It is necessary to rely on the masses and mobilize the masses. Overcome the masses' ideas of relying on heaven and the government, as well as their侥幸 mentality, and actively engage in self-salvation, launching a mass-based movement to earn merit. In mobilizing the masses for self-salvation, it is necessary to implement a reasonable burden policy—on the one hand, to ensure that all the masses go all out, and on the other hand, to ensure that landlords and rich peasants contribute more money in principle, based on their ability to pay. In flood prevention and dike protection, it is necessary to strengthen vigilance and prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents. Local experience has proven that relying on old embankments for dike protection and rescue without relying on the masses has consistently yielded poor results.

(4) For important embankments and critical locations, it is necessary to dispatch experts and water conservancy engineering teams to take specific responsibility for dike protection and repair. It is necessary to prepare dedicated transportation, assign additional personnel to monitor water conditions, and strengthen communication between localities.

(5) At present, all localities should prioritize repairing dangerous works and treat rescuing disaster victims as secondary. Otherwise, if the importance of the two is reversed, more embankments will breach, the disaster will become more severe, and it will be difficult to manage. However, it is necessary to provide emergency assistance and resettlement to disaster victims who have breached the dikes.

(6) In areas where embankments have breached, party committees in all localities, in addition to paying attention to providing emergency assistance to disaster victims, should mainly focus on how to reorganize production, enable the masses to carry out production for self-salvation, help each other, practice thrift to prepare for famine. On the one hand, actively drain water and plan to plant available grains and vegetables in a timely manner after the disaster. On the other hand, under possible conditions, organize disaster victims to grow miscellaneous grains in the mountains and engage in fisheries and sideline occupations, and the government will provide certain production loans.

    指示防汛抢险
  　分清职责依靠群众组织灾民生产自救
    【新华社上海电】中共中央华东局，以长江江水急涨，苏皖两省沿江地带险象环生，若干地段且已溃决成灾，情况之严重，为一九三一年以来所未有，特于本月十一日向所属各级党委发出关于防汛抢险的指示。指示要求各地切实执行下列各点：（一）沿江沿湖凡水灾可能侵袭和已被侵袭之地，各级党委必须把防汛护堤，抢险救灾作为当前紧急的战斗的中心任务，迅速建立和加强防汛抢救组织，动员党政军及一切人民，统一领导，分段负责，重点使用力量，突击抢救最危急地带，并充分组织后备力量，以便必要时能不断投入抢救。（二）在护堤抢险中，要首长负责，干部带头，分清责任，严格纪律，责成各段圩区在一定水位下确保堤圩。否则抢救不力，溃决成灾，该处党委和政府要负责任。反之，完成抢险任务者，则给以奖励。负责护堤工作的干部，必须领导群众，不辞艰辛，夜以继日的工作，要充分发扬与人民同生死，共患难的精神，并防止产生只顾自己地区，不顾大局的本位倾向。（三）要依靠群众，发动群众。克服群众靠天、靠政府思想及侥幸心理，积极自救，展开群众性的立功运动。在发动群众自救中，要贯彻合理负担政策——一面使所有群众全力以赴，一面使地主、富农本有钱出钱原则，较多负担。在防汛护堤中，要加强警惕，防止匪特破坏。各地经验证明：不依靠群众，而依靠旧圩荡护堤抢险，效果俱坏。（四）重要圩堤险要处，要拨派专家及水利工程队负专责护堤抢修，要准备专用的交通工具，增派专人掌握水情，并加强各地间的联系。（五）目前各地应以抢修险工为主，急救灾民为次。否则两者轻重倒置，圩堤溃决愈多，灾情将愈重，难于收拾。但对破堤的灾民加以急救及安置，则是必要的。（六）在圩堤溃决之处，各地党委除注意急救灾民外，主要的还在于如何重新组织生产，使群众进行生产自救，互助互济，节约备荒。一面积极排水及计划灾后能适时种植可种的粮食蔬菜，一面在可能的条件下，组织灾民上山种杂粮及从事渔业副业等，政府并给以一定的生产贷款。
