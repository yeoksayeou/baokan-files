　　American Chase Bank Violates Laws
  　Dares to Resist Verification of Funds
  　Tianjin Military Control Commission Orders Closure
    [Special Dispatch] The American Chase Bank in Tianjin, failing to comply with the laws and decrees of the People's Government and refusing to submit its funds for verification, was formally notified by the Tianjin Military Control Commission on the 23rd that it must cease operations for liquidation. He Songting, Director of the Financial Department of the Tianjin Military Control Commission, issued the following statement on this matter:
    Since the promulgation of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Banks and Money Shops in the North China Region" and the commencement of registration and verification of funds, most Chinese and foreign banks in the city have generally been able to fulfill the requirements and submit their funds for verification as scheduled. Only the American Chase Bank refused to verify its funds and made the unreasonable demand that our People's Government must first approve the bank as a designated foreign exchange bank before it would submit to verification. At that time, this office, considering that the foreign bank might not fully understand the policies and decrees of the People's Government, granted repeated extensions and gave instructions, pointing out that verification of funds is a law that all banks must abide by; as for the approval to be a designated foreign exchange bank, it is a matter concerning the sovereignty of the People's Government and cannot be obtained by means of coercion. The bank must fulfill the requirement of verifying its funds and obtain legal qualifications before it can request the government to approve it as a designated foreign exchange bank. At the same time, in order to give the bank an opportunity to correct its errors, two extensions were granted after the expiration of the verification period to urge it to change its attitude. However, the bank continued to ignore the government's laws and decrees and advice, persisted in its errors, openly defied the laws and decrees of the People's Government, and refused to fulfill the requirement of submitting its funds for verification. In order to safeguard the dignity of the laws and decrees of the People's Government, this office could not tolerate this and, after the expiration of the second extension period on the 22nd of this month, ordered it to cease operations and announced the above process.

　　美商大通银行违犯法令
  　竟敢抗拒交验资金
  　津军管会令其停业
    【本报特讯】天津美商大通银行不遵守人民政府法令，拒绝交验资金，天津军事管制委员会特于二十三日正式通知该行停业清理。天津军管会金融处处长何松亭就此发表谈话如下：
    自华北区银钱业管理暂行办法公布，并开始登记与检验资金后，本市各华商外商银行一般均能履行规定，如期交验资金。独有美商大通银行，拒绝验资，并提出必须我人民政府先批准该行为外汇指定银行，始能验资的无理要挟。当时本处体念该外商对于人民政府政策法令可能有不了解处，曾予一再展期，并给予训示，指出验资是一切银行必须遵守的法令；至批准为外汇指定银行，则是人民政府主权所关的事，不能用要挟手段获得。该行必须履行验资规定，取得合法资格后，方有可能向政府要求批准其为外汇指定银行。同时为给该行以改正错误的机会，特在验资期满后两次展期，促其改变态度。乃该行对政府的法令和劝告仍不理会，坚持自己的错误，公然违抗人民政府的法令，拒绝履行交验资金的规定。本处为维护人民政府法令的尊严，断难容忍，遂于本月二十二日第二次展期期满后令其停业，并宣布经过如上。
