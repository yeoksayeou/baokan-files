Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 23rd – The General Headquarters of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army has issued a communiqué announcing that in the Yisha Campaign, over 5,700 enemy troops were annihilated, and six cities including Yichang and Shashi were captured. Furthermore, the enemy's Yangtze River defense line was breached between Dangyang and Yichang. The communiqué stated: Before our powerful corps in the Jianghan area began operations on the 6th of this month, Song Xilian, commander of the bandit Xiang-E Pacification Zone, had received an order from the bogus Ministry of National Defense, dreaming of orchestrating a so-called "local counter-offensive plan in Central China." He gathered the forces of four armies and one security brigade to invade Dangyang and Yuan'an, attempting to reoccupy Dang and Yuan, and to spy on Xiangfan, in order to cover the remaining bandits in the Xiang-E-Chuan-Qian area and establish their last resistance base in the southwest. After the bandit army advanced into Yuan'an on the 6th, our army immediately swung south and the remnant bandits collapsed at the first touch. Our army then braved the heat and heavy rain in the water network area, overcame various difficulties, and relentlessly pursued the fleeing enemy. For example, a certain regiment made a forced march of 180 li, crossed 48 rivers, and thrust into Songjiazu between Yichang and Dangyang, annihilating two enemy battalions. A certain unit, braving enemy aircraft and naval bombardment, bravely crossed the Yangtze River and repelled a counterattack by an enemy battalion on the opposite bank of Yichang, seizing and consolidating the advance position for the large army to cross the river. Thanks to the unparalleled bravery of our commanders and fighters, from the start of the battle on the 11th to the 16th, we successively occupied the cities of Dangyang, Yuan'an, Shashi, Jiangling, and Yichang, completely eliminating the remnant bandits north of the Yangtze River, and breaking through the Yangtze River defense line between Dangyang and Yichang, opening the way for our army to advance. During our army's advance, the people of Yisha, who had been long oppressed by the Jiang bandits, warmly welcomed us, spontaneously setting off firecrackers and providing tea and water to comfort our troops, further inspiring the strong will of our commanders and fighters to cross the river and kill the enemy. Preliminary statistics of the battle results are as follows: Annihilation of parts of the enemy's regular army's Second Army, Seventy-ninth Army, One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Army, Fifteenth Army, and local bandit forces such as Liu Lihui's two regiments, and part of the bogus Hubei Security Fourth Brigade, totaling 5,740 men. Among them, 633 enemy officers and soldiers, including Chen Boquan (killed), commander of the 179th Regiment of the 64th Division, and Chen Sizhen (drowned), commander of the 490th Regiment of the 164th Division, were killed or wounded. 4,994 enemy officers and soldiers were captured alive, and 113 enemy troops surrendered. The following were seized: 3 mortars, 27 60mm guns, 4 flamethrowers, 6 grenade launchers, 43 rifle grenades, 33 heavy machine guns, 205 light machine guns, 73 submachine guns, 460 rifles and pistols, 199,602 rounds of ammunition, and other military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 23rd – The Military Control Commissions of Yichang and Shashi have been established by order of the Hubei Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. Peng Ziqi is the Director of the Yichang Military Control Commission, and Yang Minghan is the Deputy Director. Song Peifu is the Director of the Shashi Military Control Commission, and Cui Xizhe is the Deputy Director.
