Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Eighth Dispatch from Milan: After the representatives to the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress had heatedly discussed his report, Soviet delegation leader Kuznetsov delivered concluding remarks on the afternoon of the 4th.

Kuznetsov first pointed out that the speeches of the various representatives showed that trade union organizations in various countries paid great attention to the issue of consolidating trade union unity to defend peace, strive for the improvement of the living standards of working people, and strive for democratic rights and freedoms. All speakers expressed anxiety and concern about the fact that the imperialists are preparing for a new war, and strongly advocated engaging in more active struggles to confront the warmongers.

After listing the various anti-democratic and reactionary measures taken by the British and American ruling classes against the working class with the help of union scabs, Kuznetsov said that in all capitalist, colonial, and dependent countries, the reactionaries are engaging in an offensive against the working class. The reactionaries are wielding weapons and preparing for a new war. He then pointed out that in the current international situation, the unity of the working class forces around the world is particularly necessary. The democratic forces are enormous and unparalleled. They greatly outweigh the reactionary forces. Our common task as workers around the world is to build a barrier to obstruct the plots of the warmongers and overthrow the sinister plans of imperialism. However, democratic forces are only effective when they are united and take action. The workers fully understand this. Moreover, the representatives of the working class at this conference have expressed it very clearly.

Kuznetsov said that to accomplish the task of consolidating the unity of our ranks, it is necessary to carry out persistent work among the workers in enterprises and institutions. The task of the World Federation of Trade Unions and its supporters in these countries is to expand the ranks of supporters of international cooperation of the working class as much as possible. The World Federation of Trade Unions must do everything possible to explain to the workers in those countries the task of the conference, which is to further expand and consolidate the unity of the working class, and must call on these workers to carry out the struggle against splitters. Every trade union member in these countries must know that the doors of the World Federation of Trade Unions and its various trade departments are wide open to all those who are willing to fight faithfully for the improvement of the living conditions of the working people, for peace, and for the freedom of democracy. Comrades! The splitters' conspiracy to destroy the World Federation of Trade Unions has failed. We are fully confident to declare that they will never succeed in their attempt to abolish the World Federation of Trade Unions. They had better not waste their time and the millions of dollars of the American bankers. I am convinced that the World Federation of Trade Unions will find ways to closely unite the ranks of the working class in the struggle to win and consolidate the democratic rights and freedoms of the working people in the struggle for world peace, for raising the living standards of the working class and all working people.

　　库兹涅佐夫在工联会上总结发言
  　号召工人团结对抗战争贩子
    指出世界民主力量大大超过反动派
    【新华社北平八日电】米兰讯：苏代表团长库兹涅佐夫在世界工联二届代表大会的代表们热烈地讨论了他的报告后，于四日下午作总结发言。
    库兹涅佐夫首先指出：各代表的发言显示：各国职工会组织对巩固职工会团结，以保卫和平、争取劳动人民的生活水平的提高及争取民主权利与自由这一问题，予以极大注意。所有发言者都对帝国主义者正准备新战争一事，表示焦虑与担心；并力主从事更积极的斗争，以对抗战争贩子。
    库兹涅佐夫在列举英美统治阶级在工贼帮助下对工人阶级所进行的种种反民主的反动措施后说：在所有一切资本主义、殖民地与附属国家内，反动派正从事对工人阶级的进攻。反动派正挥动着武器并准备着新的战争。他继即指出：在目前国际形势下，全世界工人阶级力量的团结特别需要。民主力量是巨大无比的。他们大大地超过反动力量。我们全世界工人的共同任务，就是建筑阻碍战争贩子的图谋的屏障和倾覆帝国主义的阴险计划。但是，民主力量只有当它们团结起来，并且采取行动的时候，才是有效的。这一点，工人是完全了解的。而且，在这次大会上工人阶级的代表们都表示得非常明确。
    库兹涅佐夫说：要完成巩固我们队伍的团结的这一任务，必须经常在企业、机关的职工当中，进行坚持不懈的工作。世界工联及其在这些国家中的支持者的任务，就是尽可能地扩大工人阶级国际合作的拥护者的队伍。世界工联必须尽一切可能向那些国家的工人解释大会的旨在进一步扩大与巩固工人阶级的团结的任务，必须号召这些工人进行反分裂分子的斗争。这些国家的每一个职工会会员，必须知道世界工联及其各业职工部的大门，是为一切愿意忠心耿耿地为劳动人民生活条件的改善，为和平与民主的自由而斗争的人们，大大地敞开着的。同志们！分裂分子破坏世界工联的阴谋已经失败了。我们有充分的信心宣布，他们在从事取消世界工联的勾当上，将永远不会成功。他们最好是不要浪费时间和美国银行家的数以百万计的金元了。我深信，世界工联在为争取全世界和平、提高工人阶级和全体劳动人民的生活水平，为赢取并巩固劳动人民的民主权利与自由的斗争中，将找到紧密工人阶级队伍的方法。
