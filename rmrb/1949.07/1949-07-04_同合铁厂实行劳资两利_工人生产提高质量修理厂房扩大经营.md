[Ji Zhong Telegraph] Baoding Nanguan private Tonghe Iron Factory has initially implemented the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit. Workers are working hard to produce, and capitalists are expanding their business. In the early days of liberation, Manager Wang Lushe did not understand the policy and mistakenly believed that labor-capital mutual benefit meant equal profit sharing. He only employed six or seven workers to barely maintain operations. This spring, Manager Wang was hired as a representative of the Baoding Municipal All-Circles Representative Conference. He gradually understood the policy, so he expanded his business and increased the number of workers to sixteen or seventeen. However, he was still confused about the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit. In early May, the municipal government, in order to help its development, sent someone to study the spirit of the labor-capital mutual benefit policy with him. His thinking changed, and he immediately convened a meeting of all workers to study and adjust wages and revise working hours. Wages were jointly negotiated based on the workers' skills and efficiency. The workers felt that the wages were low, but considering that the factory had been damaged by the enemy, they only asked for an extra fifteen catties of rice per month to buy a pair of shoes. This suggestion was accepted by Manager Wang, who also proposed that in the future, a portion of the bonus would be drawn each month to reward workers who are active in production. Working hours were also changed from thirteen hours a day to ten hours; the food has also improved. It was also decided to hold a general meeting every half month (because the factory is small and there are few people) to jointly discuss various production, management, and life issues. After the meeting, the workers were very active in production. In the past, they worked for thirteen hours and produced 2,000 catties of iron products. Now, even with ten hours, the output is not less. Manager Wang Lushe happily said: "If the work is regular and the workers' living problems are properly solved, the factory will not suffer. More work is done, better products are produced, and raw materials can be saved. Look, now the workers even pick out iron pieces as small as the tips of their fingers. This time I know that doing things according to policy is beneficial to everyone." They are now planning to repair the factory buildings to continue expanding their business.

　　同合铁厂实行劳资两利
  　工人生产提高质量修理厂房扩大经营
    【冀中电】保定南关私营同合铁工厂，初步贯彻劳资两利政策，工人努力生产，资方扩大营业。解放初期，经理王录舍不了解政策，误解劳资两利是对半分红，只用了六七个工人勉强维持。今年春，王经理被聘为保市各界代表会的代表，对政策逐渐了解，于是扩大营业，增加工人至十六七个。但对劳资两利政策还糊涂。五月初市政府为了帮助其发展，派专人与其研究劳资两利政策精神，思想才转变过来，立刻召集全体工人开会，研究调整工资，改定工时等问题。根据工人技术和效率的高低，共同商订工资。工人觉得工资低，但又念及柜上被敌人破坏，只要求每月多增十五斤米买双鞋穿。这意见被王经理接受了，并提出今后每月从红利中抽一部分，奖给生产积极的工人。工时也由每日十三小时改为十小时；伙食也有所改善。并决定每半月开一次全体会议（因为厂小人少），共同商讨生产、经营、生活各种问题。会后工人生产很积极，过去做工十三小时，出二千斤铁的成品，现在改为十小时一点也不少出货。经理王录舍高兴地说：“工作有定时，适当解决工人生活问题，厂方并不吃亏，活做的多，成品出的好，还可节省原料。你看现在工人连手指头肚大的铁块都拣出来，这回我算知道了按政策办事，就都有利。”现正计划修理厂房，以便继续扩大营业。
