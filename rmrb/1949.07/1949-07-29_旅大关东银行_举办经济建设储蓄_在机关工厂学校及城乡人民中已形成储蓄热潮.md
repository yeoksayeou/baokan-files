Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 28th: The Lü (Shun) Da (Lian) Administrative Office promulgated the Kwantung Bank Economic Construction Savings Measures last month, calling on the people to save and concentrate funds for production and construction. Due to the stable value of the Kwantung currency in the Lüda area, the gradual rise in people's living standards, and the continuous improvement of political awareness, on the first day the measures were promulgated, the amount of money people saved in the bank reached more than 1.1 million Kwantung currency. The savings movement immediately became a craze in various institutions, organizations, factories, schools, and among urban and rural people. In one month, the number of people participating in savings in the entire region reached more than 28,000, and the amount of savings reached more than 62.8 million Kwantung currency. Workers are the most enthusiastic about saving, and many factories have established savings committees. The eight factories affiliated to the Sino-Soviet Fisheries Company have launched a savings competition; 80 workers at the Jin County Aquatic Products Company have each saved more than 500 yuan. 407 employees of the Lüda Shipyard saved more than 173,000 yuan. All the staff of the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions decided to give up smoking and save all the money allocated for cigarettes each month. Under the leadership of labor heroes, farmers also actively participated in the savings movement. For example, Miao Jianying, a special-class labor hero in agriculture in Jin County, promoted farmers in his village to save more than 60,000 yuan. Another special-class labor hero in agriculture in Lüda, Zhao Zhensheng from Dalian County, also promoted the entire village to formulate a savings plan. He guarantees that his whole family will save 15,000 yuan this year.

　　旅大关东银行
  　举办经济建设储蓄
    在机关工厂学校及城乡人民中已形成储蓄热潮
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】旅（顺）大（连）行政公署于上月颁布关东银行经济建设储蓄办法，号召人民节约储蓄，以集中资金投向生产建设。由于旅大地区关东币币值稳定，人民生活逐渐上升，政治觉悟亦不断提高，办法颁布的第一天，该地人民向银行储蓄的款项，即达关东币一百数十万元以上。储蓄运动立刻在各机关、团体、工厂、学校以及城乡人民中，成为热潮。一个月来，全区参加储蓄的人数达二万八千余人，储款额达关东币六千二百八十万余元。工人对储蓄最为踊跃，许多工厂成立了储蓄委员会。中苏渔业公司所属的八个厂都掀起了节约储蓄竞赛；金县水产公司八十名工友每人都储蓄了五百元以上。旅大造船公司四百零七名职工储蓄了十七万三千多元。旅大职工总会全体人员决定戒香烟，将每月配给烟折款全部储蓄。农民们在劳动英雄带头下也积极参加了储蓄运动。如金县旅大农业特等劳动英雄苗建英，推动他所在的村子的农民储蓄了六万余元。另一旅大农业特等劳动英雄——大连县的赵振声，也推动全村订出了储蓄计划。他保证他全家在今年储蓄一万五千元。
