　　Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League
  　Issues Circular Telegram Commemorating "July 7th"
    [Ping City News] The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League today issued a circular telegram commemorating "July 7th." The text of the telegram is as follows:
    As the Chinese People's Liberation War is about to achieve a comprehensive victory, we greet the 12th anniversary of "July 7th" with unparalleled excitement. We extend our respects to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army who have fought bravely in the eight-year War of Resistance and the three-year People's Liberation War, and we pay our respects to the glorious martyrs!
    In the 51 years of resolute struggle against Japanese imperialism and the four years against the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people of Taiwan have strengthened their ranks. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they will resolutely support the slogans of the CCP Central Committee, cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to fight to Taiwan, liberate the compatriots in Taiwan, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and carry the revolution through to the end.
    Smash the US imperialist plot to separate Taiwan!
    Conclude a peace treaty with Japan with China's participation as soon as possible!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!
    Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　July 7th
