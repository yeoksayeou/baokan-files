Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st: The East China Foreign Trade Administration, in order to vigorously support export manufacturers and promote export trade, promulgated the "Interim Measures of the East China Foreign Trade Administration for Promoting Export Trade" on June 29th. These measures shall take effect immediately. The measures stipulate: If the actual domestic cost of export goods is higher than the foreign market price, making it impossible to export, the Trade Bureau may, depending on the circumstances, order state-owned trading companies to purchase them. For export manufacturers with outstanding performance, if it is verified that they have genuine financial difficulties, the Trade Bureau may consult with the Bank of China or designated banks to provide assistance in export usance or packing loans. For exporters holding letters of credit, if their goods can be shipped for export within one month and they are indeed experiencing difficulties in working capital turnover, the Trade Bureau may verify the situation and consult with the Bank of China to purchase their letters of credit. If an exporter applies for consignment export to develop new overseas markets, the Trade Bureau shall give priority to its approval and provide assistance when necessary. For goods that are prohibited from import or require special permission for import, if they are indeed raw materials necessary for manufacturing export products or raw materials for packaging export goods, they may be specially permitted for import with the approval of the Trade Bureau; however, the finished products or packaged outgoing goods should be guaranteed to be exported within six months. Manufacturers who accept foreign commissions to import raw materials for processing and then export them shall, with the approval of the Trade Bureau, import them with their own foreign exchange, but must re-export them within the specified date; and when exporting, they shall hand over the foreign exchange for processing profits and other expenses to the designated bank for transfer to the Bank of China to exchange for foreign exchange deposit certificates. When industrial export product manufacturers apply to import the machinery, raw materials, and foreign materials for packaging their export goods with the foreign exchange earned from exporting their products, the Trade Bureau shall give priority to approving them according to their actual needs. The Trade Bureau may entrust relevant authorities to inspect the standards and quality of industrial export finished products, and assist in their improvement and standardization. In order to meet the needs of foreign sales, the Trade Bureau may also, in conjunction with relevant authorities, formulate export product increase plans and implement them effectively. Excellent export products will be rewarded by the Trade Bureau; inferior export products will be prohibited from export, and all assistance will be stopped.

    【新华社上海一日电】华东区国外贸易管理局为大力扶持出口厂商，推广输出贸易，特于六月二十九日公布“华东区国外贸易管理局推广输出贸易暂行办法”。该办法自即日起施行。该办法规定：出口货之国内实际成本如高于国外市场价格，因而不能出口时，贸易局得酌量情形饬令国营贸易公司收购之。对于成绩优秀之出口厂商，如查明确有资金困难情形，得商请中国银行或指定银行予以出口押汇或打包贷款之协助。凡持有信用状之出口商，其货品能于一个月之内装运出口者，资金周转确属困难时，贸易局得查明情形，商请中国银行收购其信用状。出口商如为开拓海外新市场申请寄售出口时，贸易局得优先核准之；并于必要时予以协助。属于禁止进口或特准进口之货物，如确系制造外销品所必需之原料或包装出口货之原料，得经贸易局核准特许进口；但其制成品或包装之出货，应保证于六个月内输出。凡制造厂商接受国外委托，输入原料加工后仍行输出者，应经贸易局核准自备外汇输入，但须于规定日期内再行输出；并应于输出时将加工利润等费之外汇，交由指定银行移存中国银行掉换外汇存单。凡工业出口品厂商的产品输出所得外汇，申请输入制造其出口货品所必需之机器、原料及包装其出口货之国外材料时，贸易局应按其实际需要优先核准之。工业出口成品之标准与品质，贸易局得委托有关机关检验之，并协助其改良与标准化。为配合外销需要，贸易局并得会同有关机关制定出口品增产计划予以切实执行。优秀之出口品贸易局将予以奖励；货劣之出口品则禁止其出口，并停止一切协助。
