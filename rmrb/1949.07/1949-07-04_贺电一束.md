　　A Collection of Congratulatory Telegrams
　　I. All-China Students' Federation's telegram to all representatives of the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers:
　　We, on behalf of students nationwide, warmly congratulate the convening of your congress. We believe that the congress will, according to Chairman Mao's directive of "integrating literature and art with workers, peasants, and soldiers," define the current tasks of literary and art workers. In the past, your excellent works have inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of our vast number of students and strengthened our fighting will. Today, in the great construction cause of New Democracy, we believe that you will create more and better works to enrich our learning content; more and better reflect the lives and struggles of the working people, in order to guide us to further integrate with workers and peasants.
　　We extend our respect to all representatives of the congress and wish the congress success.
　　All-China Students' Federation
　　July 1, 1949

　　II. All-China Women's Federation's telegram to the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers:
　　Literature and art are powerful weapons for uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and eliminating the enemy. Our advanced literary and art workers have already used this weapon to add considerable strength to the entire revolutionary cause. Now that national victory is approaching, the national literary and art workers, united under the banner of Mao Zedong, will surely play a great role in the construction cause of the New Democratic society. We warmly congratulate the victory and success of the congress.
　　Respectfully, All-China Democratic Women's Federation

　　III. Northeast Bureau, Northeast Administrative Committee, and Military Region's telegram to all representatives of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers:
　　We are delighted to hear that the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers has opened today, and we extend our warm congratulations to you.
　　The gathering of national literary and art worker representatives to hold such a grand meeting is a gratifying event since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.
　　In the long-term heroic and arduous struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, you have not only used the weapon of literature and art to reflect the great and arduous struggle of the Chinese people and to inspire the people's will to struggle, but also bravely participated in various people's liberation causes and movements, writing a new and glorious page in the history of Chinese people's literature and art. Your contributions to the Chinese people's liberation cause are indelible. However, in the past, due to the division and persecution by the Kuomintang reactionaries, literary and art workers from all over the country could not come together to coordinate their actions in a planned way and fully exert their strength. Now that the country is about to be completely liberated, representatives from all over the country can finally gather in the people's Beiping to exchange past experiences and plan future work. And the moving picture of the new China will provide even richer material for literature and art. We believe that you will continue to follow the direction determined by Chairman Mao that literature and art should serve the masses of the people, first and foremost the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and be more united, aligned, and create countless new artistic achievements with profound ideological significance and high artistic standards, playing a greater role in inspiring the people nationwide to participate in the struggle to liberate the whole country and in production and construction. We send this telegram to congratulate you, wish you good health, and wish the congress success.
　　Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
　　Northeast Administrative Committee
　　Northeast Military Region

　　IV. Third Field Army's telegram to the Presidium of the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers:
　　The National Congress of Literary and Art Workers has opened in Peiping, and people's literary and art work can be further developed in the future. In addition to sending representatives from our army to the congress to study and improve the literary and art work of our troops, we send this telegram to congratulate you and are determined to annihilate the remaining enemies and liberate the whole of Jiangnan and even the whole of China to celebrate the success of the congress.

　　贺电一束
    一、全国学联电中华全国文学艺术工作者第一次代表大会全体代表们：
    我们谨代表全国学生热烈地祝贺你们大会的召开，相信大会必将根据毛主席所指示的“文艺与工农兵相结合”的方针，规定文学艺术工作者当前的任务。过去，你们优秀的作品曾经鼓舞了我们广大同学的革命热情，坚强了我们战斗的意志。今天，在新民主主义的伟大的建设事业当中，相信你们一定会创作更多更好的作品，充实我们学习的内容；更多更好的反映劳动人民的生活和斗争，以引导我们进一步与工农相结合。
    谨向大会全体代表们致敬，并预祝大会成功。

    二、全国妇联电中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会：
    文学艺术是团结人民，教育人民，打击敌人，消灭敌人的有力武器，我们的先进的文学艺术工作者，已经运用这个武器给整个革命事业增加了不少的力量。现在全国胜利即将到来，团结在毛泽东旗帜下的全国的文学艺术工作者，在新民主主义社会的建设事业中，一定会发挥伟大的作用，我们热烈祝贺大会胜利成功。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会敬贺
    三、东北局东北行政委员会及军区电全国文艺工作者代表大会全体代表们：
    欣闻全国文艺工作者代表大会今日开幕，我们谨向你们致热烈的庆贺。
    全国文艺工作者代表聚首一堂，举行这样的盛会，这是延安文艺界座谈会以来一个值得欢欣鼓舞的盛举。
    在中国人民反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的英勇艰苦的长期斗争中，你们不但用文艺的武器，反映了中国人民伟大而艰巨的斗争，鼓舞了人民斗争的意志，而且英勇的参加了各种人民解放事业的斗争和运动，在中国人民大众的文艺史上写下了新的光辉灿烂的一页，你们对中国人民解放事业的劳绩是不可磨灭的。但过去由于国民党反动派的分割和迫害，全国各地的文艺工作者不能汇合在一起，有计划的配合行动，充分发挥自己的力量。现在全国快要完全解放了，全国各地的代表终于能在人民的北平汇集在一起，交流过去的经验，策划往后的工作。而新中国动人的图景，将为文艺提供更加丰富的题材。我们相信，你们将会继续遵从着毛主席确定的文艺为人民大众首先为工农兵服务的方向，更加团结一致，整齐步调，共同创造有着深刻思想意义和高度艺术水平的无数新的艺术成果，在鼓舞全国人民参加解放全国的斗争和生产建设中起更巨大的作用。谨电驰贺，敬祝诸位健康，并贺大会成功。

    四、第三野战军电全国文代会主席团：
    全国文代会在平开幕，今后人民文艺工作可得到更广大的发展，除派本军代表前赴大会学习以改进我部队文艺工作外，特电致贺，并坚决的歼灭残敌，解放全江南乃至全中国来庆祝大会的成功。
