　　Beiping City Holds Grand Rally on the Eve of "July 7th" Incident
  　Bo Yibo Speaks on the Basic Reasons for Victory
    Citywide Commemoration of "July 7th" to Be Grandly Held Today
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beiping City Expanded Preparatory Committee for the Commemoration of the "July 7th" Incident held a lecture meeting last night (the 6th) at the Democracy Square of Peking University. Comrade Bo Yibo, Secretary of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Qian Junrui, member of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, and democratic figures Li Da and Sun Jian of the Special Forces of the North China Military Region attended and gave commemorative speeches. Approximately 10,000 people listened to the lectures, including all the students of the Southbound Work Group and students from Peking University and Sino-French University.

    After Comrade Sun Jian of the Political Department of the Special Forces of the North China Military Region recounted the arduous battles of the Eighth Route Army and the people, Comrade Bo Yibo gave a speech. He pointed out that the People's Liberation War was a continuation of the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek replaced Wang Jingwei, and American imperialism replaced Japanese imperialism. The Chinese people continued their mission of striving for independence, democracy, and freedom. The War of Resistance Against Japan, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, achieved complete victory; the People's Liberation War, also under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has achieved a basic victory and will soon achieve national victory. These victories are due to the fact that the Chinese Communist Party has developed such a correct line over the past twenty-eight years, which is what Chairman Mao instructed us, the proletarian-led people's democratic revolution line based on the worker-peasant alliance. This means that the revolution must be led by the most conscious, most determined, and most far-sighted proletariat, and must unite the vast majority of the Chinese people, first of all the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. This line can guide us to defeat enemies like Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and can also guide us to complete the construction tasks of the new China.

    In his speech, Comrade Qian Junrui especially awakened everyone to cultivate revolutionary patriotism combined with internationalism.

    After explaining the significance of commemorating the July 7th Incident, democratic figure Mr. Li Da proposed that commemorating the July 7th Incident must include the people's democratic New China government dispatching plenipotentiary representatives to participate in the peace treaty with Japan concluded in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

    [Report from this newspaper] Today—July 7th—is the 12th anniversary of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and also to celebrate the convening of the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference. All sectors of Beiping City's Party, government, military, and people have specifically decided to hold a grand commemorative celebration meeting in front of Tiananmen Square in Beiping today, and have invited the central and North China-level organs of the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations to participate, totaling sixty-five units.

    The conference will invite leading Party, government, and military leaders and representatives of various democratic parties to give speeches. The entire process of the conference will be filmed by the North China Film Company.

　　平市“七七”前夕盛大集会
  　薄一波讲胜利基本原因
    全市纪念“七七”大会今隆重举行
    【本报讯】北平市扩大纪念“七七”筹备会昨（六）晚在北大民主广场举行讲演会。中共中央华北局书记薄一波同志，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员钱俊瑞同志，民主人士李达和华北军区特种兵部队孙健同志等四人出席作纪念讲演。听讲者有南下工作团全部学员及北大、中法等校学生共约一万人。
    在华北军区特种兵部队政治部孙健同志讲述八路军和人民艰苦作战经过后，即由薄一波同志演讲，他指出：人民解放战争是抗战的延续，抗战胜利后，蒋介石代替了汪精卫，美帝国主义代替了日本帝国主义，中国人民继续了争取独立、民主、自由的任务。抗日战争在中国共产党领导下，完全取得胜利了；人民解放战争，也在中国共产党的领导下，取得了基本上的胜利，不久就可以取得全国的胜利。这些胜利是由于中国共产党二十八年来锻炼出了这样一条正确的路线，这就是毛主席指示给我们的，无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主革命路线，这就是说，革命必须由最觉悟、最坚决、最有远见的无产阶级来领导，而又必须团结全中国人民的绝大多数，首先是农民阶级和小资产阶级及民族资产阶级。这条路线可以引导我们战胜象日本帝国主义和国民党反动派这样的敌人，也可以引导我们完成新中国的建设任务。
    钱俊瑞同志在讲演中特别唤醒大家要培养与国际主义相结合的革命的爱国主义。
    民主人士李达先生在说明纪念七七的意义后，提出纪念七七，必须要有人民民主的新中国政府派遣全权代表参加依照波茨坦协定所缔结的对日和约。
    【本报讯】今日——七七——为抗日战争十二周年纪念日，同时为庆祝新政协筹备会的召开，北平市党、政、军、民各界，特定今日在北平天安门前隆重举行盛大的纪念庆祝会，并邀请中共中央暨华北级各机关及各民主党派，各人民团体参加，共有六十五个单位。
    大会将邀请党、政、军首长及各民主党派代表讲演，大会全部过程，并将由华北电影公司摄成影片。
