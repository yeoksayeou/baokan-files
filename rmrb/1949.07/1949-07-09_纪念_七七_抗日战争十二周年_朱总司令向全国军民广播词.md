Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, July 7th: Commander-in-Chief Zhu broadcasted to the people and army of the whole country from the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station on the occasion of the twelfth anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War. The full text is as follows:

Comrades throughout the country! Commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army!

Today is the twelfth anniversary of our Chinese nation's "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, precisely at a time when the Chinese People's Liberation War has achieved a basic victory. All our compatriots and all the People's Liberation Army should hold a warm celebration for this anniversary.

After the failure of China's first Great Revolution, our nation's vicious enemy, Japanese imperialism, painstakingly plotted to destroy China. Internally, our nation produced such unfilial descendants as the Kuomintang reactionaries, who were utterly subservient and compromising externally, while internally they specialized in oppressing the people, carrying out counter-revolutionary civil war, and massacring Communists and patriotic democratic人士. Thus, they deeply drew Japanese imperialism into China. Before the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, our national crisis was extremely profound, and the entire country was in danger of being destroyed by Japanese imperialism. Under the call and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and other advanced patriotic elements, the Chinese people forced the Kuomintang government to temporarily abandon its policy of non-resistance. Throughout the entire eight-year Anti-Japanese War, Japanese imperialism displayed unparalleled barbarity and cruelty towards the Chinese nation. The Chinese Communist Party and the Anti-Japanese People's Liberation Army under its leadership displayed infinite loyalty to the motherland and infinite courage towards the enemy. The Kuomintang army, except for resisting for a little over a year at the beginning of the war, later adopted a policy of passively resisting Japan and actively opposing the people, actually helping the Japanese aggressors harm the Anti-Japanese War. However, the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, thanks to the persistent struggle of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army under its leadership, thanks to the support and persistence of the Chinese people and all anti-Japanese democratic parties for the war, thanks to the cooperation of the Allied countries, and especially thanks to the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to the Northeast to annihilate the million-strong elite of the Japanese Kwantung Army, finally achieved the final victory.

After Japan surrendered, China could have hoped to gain independence, peace, and democracy from then on, but American imperialism actively invaded China, and the Kuomintang traitorous government sold the country to American imperialism, and with the full support of American imperialism, launched an unprecedented large-scale counter-revolutionary war in China three years ago. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the assistance of the people of the whole country, carried out a heroic resistance to this counter-revolutionary offensive. The People's Liberation War waged by the Chinese people is actually a continuation of the Anti-Japanese War, and its basic purpose is to realize the independence, peace, and democracy that the Anti-Japanese War sought to achieve. The People's Liberation War has now achieved a basic victory. In the past three years, the People's Liberation Army has annihilated 5.59 million reactionary Kuomintang troops. The reactionary, traitorous rule of the Kuomintang has been destroyed. The remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries will soon be completely eliminated.

While the Chinese people have achieved a great military victory, they have also achieved a great political victory. American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries are completely isolated in China; the Chinese people's democratic united front is expanding and consolidating day by day. On May 1, 1948, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed to the people of the whole country to convene a new Political Consultative Conference and establish a democratic coalition government. This proposal received a unanimous response from all democratic parties and people's organizations throughout the country. On June 15th of this year, the preparatory committee of the new Political Consultative Conference, organized by 23 units and 134 representatives, has been established. This preparatory committee is actively preparing to convene a new Political Consultative Conference in the near future. After the new Political Consultative Conference is convened, the National Democratic Coalition Government will be established, and the People's Democratic Republic of China, a people's democratic dictatorship, will be born. This is the great success of the three-year People's Liberation War, and it is also the great success of the Chinese people's thirty-year revolutionary struggle since the May Fourth Movement in 1919. From then on, Chinese history will break away from the old era of feudal, semi-feudal, and semi-colonialism and enter a new era of independence, democracy, peace, unity, prosperity, and strength.

After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, American imperialism, in the Far East, on the one hand, implemented a policy of supporting the Kuomintang reactionaries in attacking the Chinese people, and on the other hand, implemented a policy of supporting the Japanese reactionaries in oppressing the Japanese people and threatening the various nations of Asia. Seeing that its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries in China, is about to be completely finished, American imperialism is further intensifying its support for the revival of Japanese militarism, wanting to use the Japanese invaders to invade our China again. We Chinese people resolutely oppose this perverse act of the United States in supporting Japanese aggressive forces. We firmly demand that Japan be demilitarized and democratically reformed in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. We oppose the long-term occupation of Japan by the United States, turning Japan into an arsenal and base of aggression in the Far East, threatening peace in Asia and the world. We advocate convening a four-nation foreign ministers' meeting with the full-fledged representatives of the People's Republic of China to quickly prepare to conclude a peace treaty with Japan. We hope that the Japanese people will unite to build a democratic Japan, work hand in hand with democratic China, jointly resist the aggression of American imperialism, and prevent the revival of Japanese aggressive forces. We must strengthen the friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union, because this alliance is the most important weapon to help us resist new aggression in the Far East.

The sunshine of the new China has already shone on the earth. We are about to begin a great movement to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong new China throughout the country. Men and women compatriots of our great motherland, our men and women workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, scientists and technical experts, patriotic industrialists, our heroic liberators of the people and defenders of the motherland – commanders, fighters, and political workers of our People's Liberation Army, bring out your infinite loyalty and ability, work a hundred times harder on the political, military, economic, and cultural fronts, eliminate the remnants of the reactionaries, suppress the sabotage of the reactionaries, and develop the construction work of industrial production, agricultural production, and cultural education. We want to build a new China, and we will surely be able to build a new China.

Long live the victory of the Chinese people's Anti-Japanese War!
Long live the victory of the Chinese people's Liberation War!
Long live the independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong new China!

　　纪念“七七”抗日战争十二周年
  　朱总司令向全国军民广播词
    【新华社北平七日电】朱总司令在“七七”抗日战争十二周年纪念日在北平新华广播电台向全国军民广播，全文如下：
    全国同胞们！人民解放军的全体指挥员，战斗员们！
    今天是我们中华民族“七七”抗日战争十二周年纪念日，正是中国人民解放战争已经取得基本胜利的时候。我们全国同胞和全体人民解放军都应当对于这个纪念日举行热烈的庆祝。
    在中国第一次大革命失败以后，我们民族的凶恶敌人日本帝国主义就处心积虑要灭亡中国，我们民族的内部则由于出了国民党反动派这样的不肖子孙，对外一味投降妥协，对内专门压迫人民，进行反革命内战，屠杀共产党员和爱国民主人士，这样，就把日本帝国主义深深地引进了中国。在“七七”抗日战争以前，我们的民族危机真是深重极了，整个国家有被日本帝国主义灭亡的危险。中国人民在中国共产党和其他先进爱国分子的号召与领导之下，逼迫国民党政府暂时放弃了不抵抗主义。在整个八年的抗日战争中，日本帝国主义对中华民族表现了无比的野蛮与残忍。中国共产党及其领导的抗日人民解放军则表现了对于祖国的无限忠诚与对于敌人的无限英勇。国民党军队除了在抗战开始的一年多曾进行了抵抗之外，以后，即采取消极抗日和积极反对人民的政策，实际上帮助日本侵略者危害抗日战争。但是，中国抗日战争由于中国共产党及其领导的人民解放军的坚持奋斗，由于中国人民和各抗日民主党派对于抗战的拥护和坚持，由于各同盟国的合作，特别是由于苏联出兵东北一举歼灭了日本关东军的百万精锐的帮助，终于取得了最后的胜利。
    日本投降以后，中国原可希望从此得到独立、和平与民主了，但是美国帝国主义又积极侵略中国，国民党卖国政府又把国家出卖给美国帝国主义，并在美国帝国主义的全力支持之下，在三年前发动了在中国史无前例的大规模的反革命战争。中国人民解放军在全国人民的援助之下，对于这个反革命进攻实行了英勇的抵抗。中国人民所进行的人民解放战争实际上是抗日战争的继续，它的基本目的就是实现抗日战争所要实现的独立、和平和民主。人民解放战争现在已经得到了基本的胜利。人民解放军在过去三年中间歼灭了反动的国民党军队五百五十九万人。国民党反动卖国的统治，已经灭亡。国民党反动派的残余力量不久就可以全部肃清。
    中国人民在军事上得到伟大胜利的时候，在政治上也得到了伟大的胜利。美国帝国主义和国民党反动派在中国是完全孤立起来了；中国的人民民主统一战线，是一天天的扩大起来，巩固起来了。一九四八年五月一日，中国共产党中央委员会向全国人民提议召集新政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府。这个提议得到了全国各民主党派和人民团体的一致响应。今年六月十五日，由二十三个单位，一百三十四个代表所组织的新政治协商会议筹备会已经成立，这个筹备会，正在积极筹备在最近召开新的政治协商会议。新的政治协商会议召开以后，全国民主联合政府即将成立，人民民主专政的中华人民民主共和国即将诞生。这是三年人民解放战争的大功告成，这也是中国人民自一九一九年五四运动以来三十年革命斗争的大功告成。中国的历史从此将脱离封建半封建和殖民地半殖民地的旧时代，进入独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的新时代。
    在抗日战争结束以后，美国帝国主义在远东，一方面实行扶植国民党反动派进攻中国人民的政策，一方面又实行扶植日本反动派压迫日本人民和威胁亚洲各民族的政策。美国帝国主义看见它在中国的走狗国民党反动派快要全部完蛋，就更加加紧扶助日本军国主义复活，想要利用日本侵略者再来侵略我们中国。我们中国人民坚决反对美国扶植日本侵略势力这种倒行逆施。我们坚决要求按照波茨坦协定实现日本非军国主义化并进行民主改革。我们反对美国长期占领日本，把日本变成远东的兵工厂和侵略基地，威胁亚洲和世界的和平。我们主张召开有中华人民民主共和国全权代表参加的四国外长会议，迅速准备缔结对日和约。我们希望日本人民团结起来建设一个民主的日本，与民主的中国携手合作，共同抵抗美国帝国主义的侵略，和防止日本侵略势力的复活。我们要加强中国和苏联的友好同盟，因为这个同盟是帮助我们抵抗远东新侵略的最重要武器。
    新中国的阳光，已经普照大地了。我们在全国范围内，就要开始建立一个独立的、民主的、和平的、统一的、富强的新中国的伟大运动。我们伟大祖国的男女同胞们，我们的男女工人们，农民们，学生们，知识分子、科学家和技术专家们，爱国的产业家们，我们英勇的人民的解放者和祖国的保卫者——我们人民解放军的指挥员，战斗员和政治工作人员们，拿出你们的无限的忠诚和能力，在政治的、军事的、经济的、文化的战线上，百倍努力地工作，消灭反动派的残余，镇压反动派的破坏，发展工业生产、农业生产和文化教育的建设工作。我们要建设一个新中国，我们一定能建设一个新中国。
    中国人民抗日战争胜利万岁！
    中国人民解放战争胜利万岁！
    独立、民主、和平、统一、富强的新中国万岁！
