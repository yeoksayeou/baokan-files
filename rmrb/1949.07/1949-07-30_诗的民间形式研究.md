　　Research on Folk Forms of Poetry
　　Ji Chuyang
　　Recently, in some of the poetry I've been reading, there are quite a few poems written in two-line stanzas. I think that writing poetry in a two-line style, if not intentional, or with a simple "catering" mentality, is acceptable. Because Li Ji's "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" is an achievement obtained through practice under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought and policy, utilizing the Shaanxi folk tune "Shuntianyou."
　　We are by no means against the use of old forms. I remember Lenin saying something insightful in "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" when discussing whether German communists should participate in the bourgeois parliament at the time: "Parliamentary politics are, of course, 'politically obsolete' for the German communists. However, we should understand that what is obsolete for us cannot be regarded as obsolete for the class or for the masses." So if there is an old form that is widely circulated among the people (such as Shuntianyou in the Shaanxi area), why can't we use it? Undoubtedly, imbued with a new mass perspective, we not only do not oppose its use, but we should use it. But this does not mean that we must use it, or that we should use it as if it were the only one.
　　Some people, because Comrade Lu Dingyi praised Li Ji's "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" in "Reading a Poem," cling to this form, thinking that this form is the only form of poetry. This is incorrect. Still others insist on making whatever poem they write into a two-line form, which is even more wrong. Because the achievement of "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" can only show the general direction of literary and artistic massification in practice, and the form of "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" itself should not be mistaken as the only form of poetry. If so, this is likely to hinder the development of poetry and prose and the diverse forms under the unified principle in the practice of massification.
　　In my opinion, the main point of Comrade Lu Dingyi in "Reading a Poem" is to say: "Seize the feudal cultural bunkers." In fact, we have not yet achieved brilliant victories on our new cultural front as we have on our military front. Therefore, we must systematically and step-by-step attack the feudal cultural positions and seize the feudal cultural bunkers. But this does not mean that everyone who writes poetry should write poetry in the form of "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang." But what should we learn from "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang"? I think the most important thing is to learn how Comrade Li Ji infused a clear new mass perspective in the use of folk forms, so that poetry, in the practice of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao's general policy for literature and art, produced and achieved artistic and political effects.
　　There are many folk forms, not just the "Shuntianyou" type, and most of them have a local character. Therefore, if we want to use old forms, we should not only limit ourselves to this type, and especially we should not rigidly pursue form only on these two lines, causing poetry to lose its vitality and become a stereotypical yoke. This tendency is anti-realistic. In fact, from the current poetry creation of the workers, peasants, and soldiers themselves, it is not all so two-line, or so even, symmetrical, and stylized. "Lenin, in his 'Partisan Warfare,' said that Marx recognized all kinds of forms of struggle, and did not simply imagine any forms, but only summarized, organized, and made conscious the forms produced in the mass struggle." What does this illustrate? This tells us the question of where a form of struggle comes from. I think: if one deviates from the vivid content of the struggle life, and only pursues form for the sake of form, that will not add anything to the total combat destination of poetry serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
　　Comrade Lu Dingyi said in another article: "Our peasants love art, but their 'food' has always been either crudely made or extremely feudal. We revolutionary cultural workers have a responsibility to provide them with new food that is good in terms of ideology, politics, and skills." "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" is undoubtedly a harvest of this effort, and our poetry workers and beginners in writing poetry must also move forward in this spirit.

　　诗的民间形式研究
    纪初阳
    最近在读到的一部分诗歌作品里，就形式讲两行两行的诗很不在少数。我想：把诗写成两行两行的样式，如果不是故意，或抱着某一种单纯的“迎合”心理，是可以的。因为李季的王贵与李香香就是利用了陕北民间的顺天游这一曲调在毛主席文艺思想、方针指导下由实践而获得的成果之一。
    我们决不反对旧形式的运用，记得列宁在右倾幼稚病一书中论德国共产党人当时应不应该参加资产阶级的议会时说过这样几句透辟的话：“议会政策，对于德国共产党人，自然是‘政治上已经过时’了。不过我们应该晓得，对于我们过了时的，不能看作于对阶级也过了时，对于群众也过了时”。那么如果有一种旧的形式，很广泛的流传在民间（如顺天游在陕北一带），为什么我们不可以运用呢，无疑的，贯串着一种新的群众观点，我们不仅不反对运用，而且是应该运用的。但这不等于说非运用它不可，或运用着仿佛这是惟一的一种。
    有些人因为陆定一同志在“读了一首诗”中表扬了李季的“王贵与李香香”，便死抱住这一形式，认为这种形式便是诗的唯一形式，这是不对的。还有人不管写什么内容的诗，非要把它弄成两行两行的样子不可，这更是错误的。因为“王贵与李香香”的这一成果，只能显示着实践文艺群众化的这一总的文艺的方向，而不能把“王贵与李香香”本身这一形式误会成是诗的惟一形式。若然，这是很可能阻碍诗文及在群众化的实践中，在统一的原则下的多样的形式的发展的。
    在我看陆定一同志在“读了一首诗”中的最主要的意思是说：“夺取封建文化的碉堡”。实在说在我们新的文化战线上还并没有如我们在军事战线上那样已获得了辉煌的战绩。所以我们必要有计划有步骤的向封建文化阵地进攻，向封建文化碉堡进行夺取。可是这并不就等于要写诗的人都写“王贵与李香香”那样形式的诗。但向“王贵与李香香”学习什么呢，我觉得最重要的是学习李季同志如何在运用民间形式这一点贯串了鲜明的新的群众观点，而使诗在毛主席所指示的文艺为工农兵服务这一总的方针的实践中，产生了获得了艺术的政治效果。
    民间的形式是很多的，并不止于“顺天游”一种，且它大半带有着地方性，因此，我们如想运用旧形式也不该只止干这一类，尤其是不应当死板的专在这两行两行上做形式的追求，使诗失掉了生动活泼而走向定型的栲枷，这倾向是反现实的。事实上从当前工农兵自己的诗创作中来看也并不都是那么两行两行，或那么均齐，对称和程式化的。“列宁在论游击战争中说到马克思承认各种各样的斗争形式，而且并不是空想出什么形式，只不过把群众斗争中所产生的形式综合起来，组织起来，并使之得到自觉性”。这说明了什么呢，这在告诉我们一个斗争的形式是从那里来的问题。我想：如果离开了生动的斗争的生活内容，而只为了形式而形式，那并不会使诗在为工农兵服务的这一总的战斗的到达点上增加什么的。
    陆定一同志在另一篇文章里说：“我国农民对艺术是爱好的，但是他们的‘食粮’向来是一则粗糙制造，二则封建意味极为浓厚，我们革命文化人，有责任来给他们以思想上政治上和技巧上很好的新的食粮”。“王贵与李香香”不消说是这一努力的收获，而我们的一些诗歌工作者和初学写诗的人也必须本着这一精神前进。
