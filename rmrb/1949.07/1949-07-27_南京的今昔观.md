　　A View of Nanjing, Past and Present
　　Professor Liang Xi, Central University

　　Nanjing, as a capital city, although it can only be considered a place of temporary security in history, and the fatuous, licentious, and tyrannical rulers of the small dynasties wanted to enjoy the pleasures of the Southern Dynasties, they could not do without this half of the country.

　　Nanjing, although not considered a cultural city, every fiery student movement that occurred, such as the "May 20th" and "April 1st" parades, easily exceeded 10,000 people, racking the brains of the Kuomintang reactionaries' secret agents.

　　Nanjing, although not comparable to the cosmopolitan Shanghai, the treasonous treaties of the big compradors, big foreign slaves, and big traitors over the past twenty years have all been nodded, signed, and thoughtlessly concluded in this stone city of crouching tiger and coiling dragon.

　　Therefore, until the fall of the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty, you would be making a mistake if you underestimated Nanjing, and you would be going down the wrong path if you overestimated Nanjing. So, what is the best way? You only need to look up and down, past and present, look at the world, broaden your mind, and observe and experience objectively, and you will discover many contradictory, irreconcilable, and disproportionate things that seem to be divided into two extremes.

　　Here, there was the Ming Taizu, who rose from being a monk, ascended, and shed his cassock to become the founding emperor, while his grandson, the Jianwen Emperor, was an emperor who fell into distress, shaved his head, and entered the mountains to become a monk. This is a contrast.

　　Here, there is an evergreen, one or two-thousand-year-old, historically famous old tree - the Six Dynasties Pine, while nearby, there are morning glories - morning glory flowers - that wither beyond recognition in less than half a day after blooming. This is another contrast.

　　Here, there is the luxurious, elegant, and aristocratic American-equipped residential area of Shanxi Road with large mansions and villas, while not far away, there are slums where the poor are cold, hungry, and have incomplete doors, windows, and walls. This is yet another contrast.

　　Here, Chiang Kai-shek single-handedly created the New Life Movement during the ten years of suppressing the communists, yet it once produced thousands upon thousands of Kuomintang party members and civil servants who sang with courtesans and danced with dancing girls every night, and played mahjong and poker every day. This is another contrast.

　　In short, the changes in Nanjing were originally too numerous to count. In the same area or at the same time, completely different things happened and completely dissimilar characters were produced. Even the old men who shouted "respond to all changes with constancy" were changing themselves.

　　Moreover, in this great era, three thousand years of history have been overturned, hundreds of millions of people have been emancipated, and all things, all people, and all places have undergone earth-shattering changes. How could Nanjing not change? I would like to talk about the changes in Nanjing before and after liberation here.

　　First, the changes in the economic situation. This can be further divided. (1) Gold and U.S. dollars. Gold and U.S. dollars, known as "Boss" and "Second Child" in Nanjing and Shanghai, were the magic weapons for U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang's bureaucratic bourgeoisie to collude with each other to manipulate politics and exploit the economy. The Kuomintang reactionary government unprecedentedly not only allowed but also welcomed the U.S. imperialist's paper money, allowing it to circulate in large quantities in our country; and it condoned the big and small corrupt officials who used their positions, their power, and their own banks and money shops to "throw out" and "suck in," "suck in" and "throw out." The IOU's and U.S. dollars earned more and more, and the family property became richer and richer. However, on the other hand, the national bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie who engaged in legitimate businesses were forced to the end of the road; and the majority of the working masses were even more cold and hungry, and were abandoned on the streets. Since the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River and quickly liberated Nanjing and Shanghai, the "harmful spirits" of the "Boss" and "Second Child," following U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang bureaucratic bourgeoisie, suddenly disappeared without a trace.

　　(2) Silver dollar dealers. Due to the drastic devaluation of the legal tender, the massive issuance of gold yuan, and the Kuomintang reactionaries' best efforts to smuggle gold, U.S. dollars, and silver dollars to South China, Taiwan, and the United States, the people of Nanjing, like the people of Shanghai, did not trust paper money and did not save paper money. As a result, the streets and alleys had long become the world of Yuan Datou. After liberation, the student union, women's federation, and New Youth League mobilized tens of thousands of students and citizens to launch a large-scale propaganda movement, persuading, lecturing, and convincing, so those who changed their professions changed their professions, and those who closed their businesses closed their businesses, and silver dollar dealers completely disappeared in Nanjing.

　　(3) Imported goods. Imported goods, especially the colorful American goods, became necessities for the bureaucratic bourgeoisie in the Kuomintang era, and decorations for the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. As for the working class, they simply could not afford them and had little to do with them. Therefore, before liberation, American luxury goods flooded department stores; after liberation, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie fled, and the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie felt that these things were only decorations and seemed dispensable. As a result, major stores underwent a major change, and all the charming American luxury goods could not find a market. I believe this is a good phenomenon for domestic goods manufacturers.

　　(4) General prices. In the Kuomintang era, prices rose month by month, day by day, and even hour by hour and moment by moment, making life extremely painful. When the People's Liberation Army arrived in Nanjing, prices stabilized, completely changing the world. Although prices in Nanjing rose again after the liberation of Shanghai, the fluctuations were not severe, and everyone could live a normal life.

　　Second, the ideological changes of intellectuals. Transforming ideology is a difficult task that must be carried out gradually and subtly. Nanjing has been liberated for less than three months, can we say that intellectuals have changed their ideology? However, what I want to point out is a small number of professors, and a partial change of ideology. Several scholars, who had always been complacent and closed off in the sacred and independent shell of science, have recently suddenly left their laboratories from time to time and mingled with the masses, engaging in social and political work, and are very active. They themselves admit that their previous style was inappropriate and have also realized that science cannot transcend politics. Several doctors, who used to like to use English even for the most common words, now prefer to say the Chinese transliteration of even translated American names and place names, even if the pronunciation is incorrect, instead of using the original names. As for the books of the new era, everyone is indeed spontaneously and enthusiastically studying them, and there are often forums.

　　Third, the drastic changes in the emotions of young students. (1) Reflected in contact with the army. "A scholar meeting a soldier, there is no reasoning to be done," is an old Chinese saying. Most students avoid soldiers when they see them, and it is best not to have contact with them. However, while students want to be estranged from the soldiers, the soldiers of the corrupt Kuomintang army want to provoke the students. Once, the soldiers stationed across from the Central University's female dormitory looked up at the female students on the opposite building every day from the garden, and suddenly had a whim and asked to visit the female dormitory, which made everyone laugh and cry and was extremely annoying. Now it is very different. The female comrades of the People's Liberation Army have become the teachers or friends of the female students, and the male comrades have become the teachers or friends of the male students, teaching singing, teaching yangko dance, talking and laughing, and mingling together, and the emotions are extremely excited. (2) Reflected in the parade. In the past, every parade was met with beatings and injuries at best, and death at worst. After the parade, due to the collusion between internal and external agents, arrests and detentions often occurred according to the clues. In this harsh environment, young students lived in constant fear and had the opportunity to enter concentration camps at any time, which was extremely terrifying. However, this year's July 7th anniversary, a mighty parade of 300,000 people in Nanjing, with students accounting for a considerable number, singing, slogans, yangko dance, gongs and drums, costumes, stilts, everyone following the red flag, everyone following the Communist Party, the students were completely crazy, this kind of emotion, I cannot describe with pen and ink. (3) Reflected in work. In the Kuomintang era, the school authorities did not allow students to mind their own business and only allowed students to study hard, so young people's talents could not be expressed. This time, the military control commission entrusted the teachers and students of each school to do management work, and the students performed the most actively, without Sundays, without holidays, and without distinguishing between day and night, everyone buried themselves in hard work, treating school affairs as their own family affairs, and the emotions were very high. (4) Reflected in the poverty relief fund. About two months after the People's Liberation Army liberated Nanjing, the military control commission sent more than 10 million RMB to Central University, saying that it was a poverty relief fund for poor students. Many students automatically declared to the military representatives that there was no need for relief. The same was true for other vocational schools. Strange! Did the students suddenly become rich? Two months ago, they were still petitioning in groups to the pseudo-presidential palace, seeking survival and seeking full public funding. Now that the people's government has sent the relief fund to their doorsteps, many students are refusing it. What is going on? What kind of emotion is this? I will not say it, please let the young people explain it themselves. Let the people explain it.

　　Fourth, the change in lifestyle. The war criminals flew away by plane, took cars, and trains, and even took their pet dogs away on the night of April 22nd. Not to mention the wives, misses, and young masters, there was no reason for them to stay in Nanjing? Those who stayed behind were probably 90% of the common people, so the lifestyle of the people of Nanjing underwent a major change. Heavy makeup and gorgeous decorations suddenly decreased, and lipstick also decreased greatly. Was this an order from the people's government? No. Although during Chiang Kai-shek's rule, several edicts were indeed issued to prohibit perming, the result was that those who were prohibited were prohibited, and those who permed permed, and Chiang Kai-shek's imperial edict was no match for the small sign of the hairdresser's electric perm, hot perm, and water perm. As for the people's government, it does not care about those small things. Then, did the young students in Nanjing with intense personalities interfere with those heavy makeup and lipstick on the streets? Even more so, no. The news reporters of American imperialism have deliberately fabricated and slandered the fact that students in Beiping forced women wearing fox fur coats to crawl on the ground, and Chinese students will never be so naive, so will Nanjing students interfere with these things? This is because the simple, heroic, cloth clothes, cloth pants, cloth shoes, and octagonal hats of the male and female comrades of the People's Liberation Army have moved the young men and women of Nanjing, so the general attire has changed unconsciously, and changed to a different lifestyle. The restaurants have also changed. Many wealthy restaurants in Nanjing have closed down, leaving only second- and third-class ones, and the taste and standards of the dishes also seem to have decreased a bit. There are fewer adults and gentlemen, and more ordinary people. Corrupt officials have fled, and hardworking communists have replaced their positions. The opportunity for large banquets is naturally gone, and the lifestyle has naturally changed. The movies have also changed. It is said that after the liberation of Nanjing, American leg films, gangster films, and films exaggerating white people did not sell well. Young people liked to watch Soviet or PLA films with educational significance the most, followed by general Chinese films. This is also a change in lifestyle.

　　In addition, electric lights, telephones, small trains, buses, etc., have all undergone significant changes before and after liberation.

　　Everything is changing, everything is changing, everyone is changing, Nanjing is changing, Shanghai is changing, and the whole of China is changing. Now it is only the beginning of the change. In the future, when the whole of China breaks free from the shackles of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism and steps onto the stage of new democracy, the changes will be even greater. Not to mention the socialist stage; not to mention the communist stage. We need to change, we need to change greatly, change a lot, and change quickly.

### 南京的今昔观

　　南京的今昔观
    中央大学教授  梁希
    南京，作为都城论，虽然在历史上只算是一个偏安之局，而昏庸，荒淫，暴戾的小朝廷统治者，要消受南朝金粉，却少不得这一座半壁江山。
    南京，虽然算不得文化城，而每一个如火如荼的学生运动发生，例如“五二○”和“四一”游行队伍动辄超过一万人，伤尽了国民党反动派中统军统人员的脑筋。
    南京，虽然比不上十里洋场，而二十多年来大买办，大洋奴，大汉奸的卖国条约，都在这个龙蟠虎踞的石头城里，点点头，签签字，不假思索地订定了的。
    所以，到蒋介石王朝灭亡为止，你若使把南京估计得太低，你就要犯错误，你若使把南京估计得太高，你又要走错路。那末怎么才好呢？你只要上下古今，俯仰天地，放大眼界，放宽胸襟，客观的视察一番，体会一番，你就会发见好许多矛盾的不调和的不相称的看起来好象是分为两极性的东西。
    在这里，有过一个由和尚出山，飞升，脱却袈裟而做开国皇帝的明太祖，而他的孙子，却是一个由皇帝落难，削发，入山而做和尚的建文帝。这是一个对照。
    在这里，有着一棵四季常绿的，一两千年不死的，历史上有名的老树——六朝松，而它的附近，却有开花不到半天便萎缩得不成样子的朝颜——牵牛花。这又是一个对照。
    在这里，有耸立着豪华的幽雅的贵族化的美国设备的大公馆大别墅的山西路住宅区，而相隔不远，就是穿不暖吃不饱门窗板壁不全的贫民窟。这又是一个对照。
    在这里，是蒋介石在十年剿共中一手制造的新生活运动的发源地，却曾经产生了几千几万夜夜捧歌妓捧舞女天天打麻将打扑克的国民党党员和公务员。这又是一个对照。
    总而言之，南京的变化，本来是多得数不清楚的。在同一地区或同一时期，竟会发生了绝然不相同的事情，产生了绝然不相类的人物。即使是一犬吠影百犬呔声叫嚣着“以不变应万变”的老爷们，他们自己也在那里变。
    何况在这个大时代里，三千年历史翻了身，几万万人民翻了身，一切事，一切人，一切地方，都起了惊天动地的大变化，南京那得不变呢？我想在这里说说南京解放前后的变动。
    第一、经济情形的变化。这里头还可分开来说。（一）黄金美钞。黄金和美钞，在南京上海大家称为“老大”和“老二”的，这是美帝和国民党的官僚资产阶级互相勾结着操纵政治剥削经济的法宝。国民党反动政府史无前例地不但允许而且欢迎了美帝的纸币，让它在我们的国内大量地流通；并且纵容大小的贪官污吏们，利用地位，利用权势，利用他们自己的银行钱庄，“抛出”“吸进”，“吸进”“抛出”。条子美钞越赚越多，家私愈弄愈富。然而另一方面，经营正当事业的民族资产阶级小资产阶级，被迫得走头无路；而大部分劳工群众，则更其衣不暖，食不饱，被抛弃在街头了。自从人民解放军横渡长江，把南京和上海迅速解放以后，“害人精”的“老大”“老二”，跟着美帝走，跟着国民党官僚资产阶级走，骤然销声而匿迹。
    （二）银元贩。由于法币的激烈变值，由于金圆券的大量滥发，更由于国民党反动派的尽量把黄金美钞和银元向华南和台湾以及美国偷运，南京人也和上海人一样，谁也不信任纸币，谁也不贮蓄纸币。以致大街小巷丁丁当当地早已成了袁大头的世界。解放后，学联，妇联和新青团动员了好几万学生和市民，发起了一个大规模的宣传运动，劝导，讲演，说服，于是改行的改行，停业的停业，银元贩子在南京完全绝迹。
    （三）舶来品。舶来品，尤其是五光十色的美国货，在国民党时代，成为了官僚资产阶级的必需品，资产阶级与小资产阶级的点缀品，至于劳工阶级，则根本买不起，不大发生关系。所以，解放以前，美国奢侈品充斥百货公司；而解放以后，官僚资产阶级逃跑一空，资产阶级与小资产阶级则因为这种东西本来不过作为点缀品，似乎可有可无。于是各大商店起了一个大变化，所有迷人的美国豪华物品找不到销路。我相信，这对于国货厂商是一个好现象。
    （四）一般物价。国民党时代，物价月月涨，日日涨，到后来甚至时时涨，刻刻涨，生活痛苦极了。解放军一到南京而物价稳定，完全变了一个世界。虽然上海解放以后，南京物价又涨高，然波动并不厉害，大家可以过正常的生活。
    第二、知识分子的思想变化。改造思想是一件困难的事，必须潜移默化，逐渐进行。南京解放不到三月，我们难道可以说知识分子便改变了思想吗？不过，我所要举出来的，是少数的教授，并且是局部的思想改变。有几位学者，一向是自满自足地闭塞在科学神圣和科学独立的甲壳里的，近来忽然时时离开研究室，和群众打成一片，从事于社会性的事业和政治性的工作了，并且十分积极。他们自己也承认从前的作风不妥，也觉悟到科学不能超政治。有几位博士，从前连最普通的字面都喜欢用英语，现在忽然连翻译出来的美国人名地名，也宁可说出声音不正确的中国译名，而不用原名了。至于新时代的书籍，大家的确在自发地热心地学习，并且时常有座谈会。
    第三、青年学生情绪的剧烈变化。（一）表现在和军队的接触。“秀才碰到兵，有理说不清”，这是一句中国的老古话。学生们大都是见大兵而避之，不接触为上策。可是，学生想和兵疏远，而国民党腐败军队的士兵却要来惹学生。有一回，中央大学女生宿舍对门驻扎的士兵，天天从园子里仰望对面楼上的女学生，忽然异想天开，来要求参观女生宿舍了，闹得大家啼笑两难，讨厌极了。现在可大大不同，人民解放军的女同志，成为了女学生的师长或朋友，男同志成为了男学生的老师或朋友，教唱歌，教秧歌舞，说说笑笑，打成一片，情绪极其兴奋。（二）表现在游行。从前每一次游行，轻则被打，受伤，重则丧命。而游行以后，由于校内特务和校外特务勾通，按图索骥，时常有逮捕拘禁事件发生。青年学生在这个恶劣的环境里，朝不保暮，随时有进集中营的机会，恐怖极了。而今年七七纪念，南京三十万人浩浩荡荡大游行，学生占了一个相当的数目，唱歌，口号，秧歌舞，锣鼓，化装，高跷，大家跟着红旗走，大家跟着共产党走，学生完全发狂了，这种情绪，我不能用笔墨描写出来。（三）表现在工作上。国民党时代，学校当局不许学生管闲事，只准学生读死书，所以青年的才能无从表现。这回，军管会委托各校师生做管理工作，学生表现得最积极，没有星期，没有假日，更不分昼夜，个个埋头苦干，把校务当做自己的家务，情绪非常高涨。（四）表现在清寒救济金上。人民解放军解放了南京大约两个月，军管会送了一千多万人民币到中央大学，说是清寒学生救济金。有好许多学生竟自动向军事代表声明，都说无须救济。其他专科学校也如此。奇怪！学生们忽然富起来了？两个月以前，还在成群结队地向伪总统府请愿，求生存，求全面公费。而人民政府把救济金送上门来，好许多学生偏偏又不要了。这是什么一回事？这是什么样的一种情绪？我不说了，请青年们自己来解释吧。让人民来解释吧。
    第四、生活方式的改变。战犯们飞的飞，坐汽车的坐汽车，坐火车的坐火车，四月二十二夜半连爬儿狗都带走了，太太，小姐，公子哥儿更不消说，那有留在南京之理？留下来的大概是百分之九十的老百姓，南京人的生活方式于是乎起了一个大变化。浓装艳服的装饰骤然减少，口红也大大地减少，这难道是人民政府的命令吗？不是的。虽然在蒋家天下的时候，确乎下过几道禁止烫发的手谕的，结果，禁者自禁，烫者自烫，蒋介石的皇皇圣旨，反而敌不过理发师电烫火烫水烫的小招牌。至于人民政府，是不管那些小事情的。然则南京性质激烈的青年学生是不是在街道上干涉过那些浓装艳服和口红呢？更不是的。北平学生逼迫马路上穿狐皮大衣的女太太在地上爬，已经被证明了，是美国帝国主义的新闻记者故意造谣和诬蔑，中国学生决不会幼稚到这种地步的，难道南京学生会干涉这些事情吗？这，由于人民解放军男女同志们那些朴素的英武的布衣，布裤，布鞋和八角帽，感动了南京的青年儿女们，所以一般的装束，在不知不觉中改变，而换了一个生活方式。饮食店也改了一个样子。南京好许多阔绰的餐馆关了门，留下来的都是二、三等以下的，菜肴的口味和标准也似乎降低了一点。大人先生少，平民多，贪官污吏逃跑，耐苦耐劳的共产党员代替了他们的职务，大请客的机会自然没有了，生活方式也自然改变。电影也改了一个局面，听说南京解放以后，美国的大腿片，强盗片，夸张白种人的片子销路不大好，青年们最欢喜看苏联或解放军的有教育意义的片子了，其次就是中国的一般电影片，这也是生活方式的一种变化。
    此外，电灯，电话，小火车，公共汽车等等，解放前后都有显著的变化。
    事事在变，物物在变，人人在变，南京在变，上海在变，整个中国也在变。现在还不过是变的开始，将来全中国挣脱了半封建半殖民地的枷锁，踏上了新民主主义的阶段，变化还要大。何况还有社会主义阶段；何况还有共产主义阶段。我们需要变，需要变得大，变得多，并且变得速。
