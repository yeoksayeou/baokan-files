　　Riveter's Song
    Riveter Liu Yongsheng

    Riveters, riveters, skilled in technique, pioneers in the workshop;
    All the world's buildings, can be repaired and manufactured;
    Can make mine locomotive roads, iron-boned bridges can be built.
    All kinds of vehicles can be made, airplanes and cannons I created.
    Submarines, battleships, cruisers, all kinds of ships are exquisitely made.
    Repairing locomotives is even more capable, all kinds of difficulties can be overcome.
    Material shortages can be overcome, research, creation, and invention,
    We repaired the "Beijing" locomotive, the boiler interior was repaired meticulously.
    Door panels, side panels, top panels, throat plates, tube sheets all replaced.
    Large and small smoke tubes replaced together, screw stays, screw sleeves, and rivets.
    When we pick up our tools, we can use any kind,
    The sledgehammer swings with a thousand pounds of force, the pneumatic hammer is like a charge.
    Repair more locomotives for the front, supporting the People's Liberation Army.
    Guangzhou and Taiwan will be liberated soon, to save our worker brothers.
    If you ask whose responsibility is great, the riveter's shoulders are not light.
　　Steam Hammer Song
　　Forgeman Wu Penghan

    Steam hammer, steam hammer, your power is truly great, you can transform society, you can boost industrial development, you produced countless machines, ships, trains, airplanes, cannons, and tanks.
    Steam hammer, steam hammer, I truly love you, and you love me too, because of you, help me greatly increase production. You love me, every day I give you a bath and add oil, protecting your lifespan. The two of us are inseparable, forever companions, struggling together, striving to produce, supporting the front lines, defeating Chiang Kai-shek and sharing peace.
　
　　Lovable Machine
　　Machine Worker Pan Rizhen
　
    Lovable machine,
    You have many years of history,
    You are our friend,
    You don't rest all year round.
    You can create tools,
    And also transform the whole world.
    I can't leave you all year round,
    Your sound roars and rumbles,
    As if fighting on the front lines,
    Cannons and machine guns charge at the enemy.
    We must protect the hardworking you,
    We will never let you break down,
    We personally pour oil, cherishing you,
    If you break down,
    I'd rather be a little sick myself.
    If I pour a little oil on you,
    It will eliminate a few more enemies.
    From now on,
    I will cherish you even more,
    Let's unite together,
    Produce more,
    Support the front lines.
　　I'm Sorry, Saw!
　　Sawmill Worker Zheng Lianqi
　
    So worried, the saw blade is broken and cannot be repaired.
    My hands are clumsy, the saw blades are broken in piles.
    Truly finished, when I connect this one, that one breaks.
    Incapable, the broken saw blades pile up like a mountain.
    Truly unskilled, the saw I repair cuts the material crooked.
    Truly ashamed, the repaired saw blades are not enough.
    Clumsy hands, the saw blade breaks easily where I press it.
    Red pine, it's not its fault, it's just me.
    Wasting tools, it makes me feel so bad.
　　Planer Turnover
　　Intern Technician Li Peiyuan
    I am a planer, strong and sturdy, today the workers are in power, and I have also turned over and seen the light of day.
    In the past: our days were truly difficult to describe, we were used as capital by the capitalists.
    The capitalists relied on us to exploit, making us tired with aching backs and sore legs.
    When the Japanese came, it was even worse, oppressing workers like horses and oxen, the workers would goof off or slip away, damaging tools and hitting us, leaving us covered in wounds. If he didn’t work hard, I wouldn’t work hard, just fooling the Japanese.
    The Kuomintang, the Second Manchuria, were the same as the Japanese, so we goofed off even more and didn’t want to work.
    The workers’ children were hungry and crying, their wives were calling out, scattering and fleeing everywhere, and my illness could no longer be supported. They threw me in a pile of scrap iron.
    Liberation, a great change, old and young workers working together with one heart, everyone like fierce tigers coming down the mountain, pulled me out of the scrap iron pile and let me see the light of day, the workers contributed effort, and worked overtime, sweating a lot, curing my illness, washing my face clean. To commemorate the proletarian martyrs and heroes, they gave me a name called "February 7th".
    From then on, day and night in the factory, I work with the workers, sing together, and make a joyful noise, for victory, launching a great production drive, rushing to complete tasks, striving to be a model, and feeling glorious. In the great competition, we and our fellow workers work happily, planing, planing, planing out axle tiles and axle boxes, making locomotives to send to the front lines, supporting the big cars going south.

　　机械歌特辑
　　铆工歌
    铆工  刘永盛
　
    铆工铆工技术精，工作堆里是先锋；
    世界一切建筑物，修理制造都能行；
    能作矿山马机道，铁骨桥梁都能成。
    各种车辆都能作，飞机大炮我造成。
    潜舰战舰巡洋舰，各机轮船造的精。
    修理机车更能干，百般困难能完成。
    材料不足能克服，研究创造又发明，
    我们修出北平号，锅炉内部修的精。
    门板侧板天顶板，喉板管板全换通。
    大小烟管一齐换，螺撑螺套与铆钉。
    提起我们用工具，使用哪种都能行，
    大锤轮起千斤力，风锤好似打冲锋。
    多修机车前方送，支援人民解放军。
    广州台湾早解放，好救工人众弟兄。
    要问谁的责任大，铆工肩上可不轻。 　　汽锤歌
　　锻冶工  吴鹏汉
    汽锤，汽锤，你的力量真大，你能改造社会，你能助长工业发展，你生产了无数的机械、轮船、火车、飞机、大炮和坦克。
    汽锤，汽锤，我真爱你，你也爱我，为了你，帮助我大量的增产。你爱我，每天给你洗澡加油，保护你的寿命。咱俩个形影相随，永作伴侣，共同奋斗，努力生产，支援前线，打垮蒋介石共享太平。
　
　　可爱的机械
　　机器工人  潘日珍
　
    可爱的机械，
    你有好多年的历史，
    你是我们的朋友，
    你一年到头都不歇。
    你能创造工具，
    也能改造全世界。
    我一年到头不能离开你，
    你的声音轰隆轰隆的响，
    好象在前方作战，
    大炮机枪冲向了敌人。
    我们要保护劳苦的你，
    我们决不让你出故障，
    我们亲手浇油，爱护你，
    要是你出故障，
    倒不如叫我害一点病。
    我给你浇上一点油，
    就会多消灭几个敌人。
    从今以后，
    我要更好好爱护你，
    咱俩团结起来，
    多多生产，
    支援前线。
　　对不起你呀，大锯！
　　火锯工人  郑连歧
　
    好发愁，锯条坏的没法修。
    手头拙，锯条坏的成了垛。
    真完蛋，接上这个那个断。
    不会干，锯条坏的堆成山。
    真不才，修出锯来拉料歪。
    真抱愧，修的锯条不够使。
    大笨手，压出锯条爱断口。
    红松木，它没错来只怪我。
    费器才，弄的心里好难过。
　　刨床翻身
　　实习技术员  李培元
    我是刨床，身强力壮，今天工人掌了权，我也翻身见了天。
    早先：咱的日子实难言，咱被资本家把握当本钱。
    资本家靠咱来剥削，把咱累的腰酸腿又弯。
    鬼子来，更糟糕，压迫工人当马牛，工人们就泡蘑菇或溜号，破坏工具敲打咱，打的咱满身疮伤。他不使劲，咱也不使劲，反正糊弄鬼子。
    “括”民党，二满洲，跟鬼子一个样，咱更泡泡磨磨不爱干。
    工人们饿的孩子哭老婆叫，四散奔逃，我的病也支持不了。被他们把咱扔在破铁堆里。
    解放了，大转变，老少工人齐心干，个个都象猛虎下了山，把我从破铁堆里翻出使我见了天，工人们又献工，又加班，流了好些汗，治好了我的病，洗净我的脸。为了纪念无产阶级烈士英豪给我起了个名字叫“二七号”。
    从此白日黑夜在厂房，我跟工人们一块干，一块唱，一块闹喧天，为了胜利，展开大生产，突击完成任务，争取模范，咱也光荣。大竞赛咱跟工友干的欢，刨呀刨呀刨出轴瓦轴箱，作出火车头送前线，支援大车下江南。
