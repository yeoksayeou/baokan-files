　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 23rd: The provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan, awaiting liberation, have suffered immense disasters due to the flooding of the Yangtze River, Pearl River, Min River, and their tributaries. The disaster areas in Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong alone encompass about one hundred counties, with the total number of victims in all provinces exceeding ten million. Among them, 57 out of 78 counties in Hunan Province have been affected, with five million victims; Guilin, Liuzhou, Chengdu and other places have become inundated.

　　In contrast to the Liberated Areas' People's Government, which is fully leading the people in flood control and disaster relief, and resettling and providing relief to the victims, the Kuomintang bandit gang allows the floods to worsen everywhere, fails to take any flood control measures, and not only does not provide effective relief to the victims, but also loots in the chaos, intensifying extortion. The Kuomintang Hunan Province "Flood Relief Committee" report stated: "Wailing sounds fill the fields, a truly heartbreaking sight. However, the supply of military grain is even more urgent, like a burning fire; human and natural disasters are pressing in on each other." Under these circumstances, the victims are displaced and many are dying. According to Kuomintang Central News Agency reports: in Guangdong, the number of victims who died by the 8th of this month has exceeded 70,000, and in Hunan, the number of deaths had reached more than 57,000 by the 16th. The broad masses of people in the yet-to-be-liberated areas, who are mired in dire circumstances, are increasingly filled with hatred for the remnant Kuomintang bandit gangs. They yearn for the People's Liberation Army to arrive soon and liberate them from the deep disasters caused by the remnant Kuomintang bandit gangs.

　　残匪任令水灾扩大趁火打劫
    待解放区湘粤等省人民渴望我军早日解救灾难
    【新华社北平二十三日电】待解放的湖南、广东、广西、江西、贵州、四川等省已因长江、珠江、闽江及其各支流泛滥而酿成巨灾，仅湖南、广西、广东三省灾区即达百县左右，各省全部灾民在千万以上。其中湖南全省七十八县中受灾县份即达五十七县，灾民达五百万；桂林、柳州、成都等地尽成泽国。
    与解放区人民政府全力领导人民抢险治水并安置和救济灾民相反，国民党匪帮任令各地水灾扩大，毫不进行任何治水措施，对灾民则不仅不予有效救济，反趁火打劫，加紧勒索，国民党湖南省“水灾救济委员会”关于湖南水灾的报告即称：“遍野哀鸿，惨不忍睹。而军粮供应更急如星火，人祸天灾交相逼至。”在此种情形下，灾民流离失所，大量死亡。据国民党中央社消息透露：广东灾民至本月八日死亡者已在七万人以上，湖南至十六日已死亡五万七千多人。现陷于水深火热中的待解放区广大人民，对残余国民党匪帮的仇恨日益高涨。他们渴盼人民解放军早日到来，把他们从残余国民党匪帮的深重灾难中解放出来。
