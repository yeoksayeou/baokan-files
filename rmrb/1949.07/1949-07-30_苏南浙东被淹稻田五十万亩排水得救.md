Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 29th: A large portion of the flooded rice fields in Southern Jiangsu and Eastern Zhejiang have been drained and rescued. In the Changzhou Special District of Southern Jiangsu, including Jiangyin, Liyang, Wujin, Yixing, and Jintan counties, over 790,000 mu of rice seedlings were affected by floods after heavy rains in mid-July, accounting for over 11% of the district's total farmland. Jiangyin was particularly severely affected, with 270,000 mu of flooded fields. After mobilization and organization by local Party and government cadres to dredge rivers and drain accumulated water, over 500,000 mu of rice fields have been rescued. Only滩田 (tidal flats),芦田 (reed fields), or low-lying fields have not yet been drained. The Changzhou Special District Office is assisting farmers in replanting and switching to other crops. In Eastern Zhejiang, including Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Tongxiang, Zhuji, and other eleven counties and cities, some flooded rice fields have also been saved thanks to the joint efforts of the military and civilians in drainage. In the Linqiao District of Hangzhou, with the assistance of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army stationed there, over 3,280 mu were rescued in six days.

　　苏南浙东被淹稻田五十万亩排水得救
    【新华社上海二十九日电】苏南、浙东各地被淹稻田，经排水抢救后，大部已出水。苏南常州专区所辖江阴、溧阳、武进、宜兴、金坛等五县，自本月中旬大雨后，受灾秧田达七十九万余亩，占全区田亩百分之十一强。其中尤以江阴最为严重，淹田达二十七万余亩。经各地党政干部动员、组织农民疏通河道，排泄积水，现已救出秧田五十余万亩，仅滩田、芦田或低洼田尚未出水。常州专署正协助农民进行补种和改种。浙东杭县、绍兴、桐乡、诸暨等十一县市被淹稻田，由于军民合力排水部分亦已获救。杭县临乔区受灾稻田，经驻地解放军某团的协助，六天中救出三千二百八十余亩。
