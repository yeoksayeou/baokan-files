The 698 sponsors, led by Song Qingling, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Guo Moruo, included representatives from China's various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic figures from all fields. In the center of the venue, a red banner with the words "Long Live the Friendship Between the Peoples of China and the Soviet Union" was hung high. On the rostrum, oil portraits of Lenin, Stalin, Sun Yat-sen, and Mao Zedong were displayed. The meeting opened with the majestic music of the Chinese People's Liberation Army March and the Soviet national anthem. The meeting elected Song Qingling, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo, Lin Boqu, Dong Biwu, Wu Yuzhang, He Xiangning, Li Jishen, Tan Pingshan, Shen Junru, Zhang Lan, Ma Xulun, Chen Yun, Lu Dingyi, Xu Teli, Bo Yibo, Nie Rongzhen, Peng Zhen, Ye Jianying, Zhang Bojun, Peng Zemin, Cai Tingkai, Cai Chang, Li Dequan, Teng Daiyuan, Li Lisan, Zhu Xuefan, Chen Boda, Luo Ruiqing, Shi Liang, Ma Yinchu, Liao Chengzhi, Shao Lizi, Wang Kunlun, Zhang Naiqi, Lan Gongwu, Zhou Jianren, Feng Wenbin, Hu Qiaomu, Zhang Xiruo, Li Da, Zhou Yang, Liang Xi, Mao Dun, Xiao San, Liu Yuhou, Chen Qiyuan, Yan Baohang, Qian Junrui, and Xie Bangding and others, fifty-one in total, as the presidium. At the beginning of the meeting, Guo Moruo delivered an opening speech (full text to be published separately), followed by Qian Junrui reporting on the initiation process, stating that after returning to China, the Chinese delegation attending the World Peace Congress deeply felt that enhancing the deep friendship between China and the Soviet Union was a major guarantee for building a new China and striving for lasting world peace. At the meeting of delegation members held on the 8th of this month, it was decided to jointly launch the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association with patriotic and democratic figures from all fields. This proposal was warmly received by representatives of democratic figures from all parties. This is the origin of today's meeting.

Subsequently, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Zhou Enlai, Wu Yuzhang, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ye Jianying, Zhang Xiruo, Li Lisan, Mao Dun, Li Dequan, and Shao Lizi spoke at the inaugural meeting. The speakers unanimously believed that the Soviet Union had given great sympathy and help to the liberation cause of the Chinese people and treated China with a truly equal attitude. The deep friendship between these two major peace bulwarks of China and the Soviet Union is an important factor for world peace. In order to promote and consolidate the traditional revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union for more than 30 years, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should be widely established throughout the country and developed into a group with rich practical work content for the broad masses.

After the meeting passed the charter of the Preparatory Committee and elected Song Qingling, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo and other eighty-one people as members of the Preparatory Committee (list to be published separately), it announced the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. For the convenience of work, the meeting, in accordance with the provisions of the charter, approved the establishment of an Executive Committee under the Preparatory Committee, and on the spot, Qian Junrui, Xiao San, Huan Xiang, Shen Zhiyuan, Lai Yali, Liao Chengzhi, Wang Kunlun, Yan Baohang, Xu Guangping, Xin Zhichao, Wang Zhixiang, Ding Zan, Lu Cui, Cao Jinghua, Chen Jiakang, Cao Yu, Zhang Zhongshi, Fan Hong and other eighteen people were organized into it. The meeting also passed a congratulatory telegram to Marshal Stalin of the Soviet Union and Chairman Mao Zedong. (Attached picture)
