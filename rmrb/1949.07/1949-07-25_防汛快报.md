　　The Jilu-Yu Yellow River Committee telephone team completed 808 li of line construction along the river in four months, greatly facilitating flood control work. The team was established last winter and consists of 80 members, mostly farmers, lacking technical skills. After training and continuous improvement in their work, the team members are now able to master general techniques. They once completed the glorious task of erecting high-altitude lines across the Yellow River. Recently, after summarizing and evaluating models, the employees unanimously proposed ensuring smooth telephone communication during the flood season.

    Continuous rain in parts of southern Hebei has caused water accumulation and flooding. 150,000 mu of low-lying areas in seven counties including Gaotang and Enxian were flooded. After the local government mobilized the masses to dig ditches for drainage, Gaotang has rescued 24,000 mu; Enxian built more than 10 li of canals in just half a day, and 1,500 mu of fertile land was exposed.

    The masses in the counties along the river in southern Hebei are rushing to repair dikes and dams. In the second district, the Yunhe River dikes within the borders of Xiajin, Enxian, Wucheng, and Qinghe counties are 500 li long. The currently repaired river dikes are two to four chi higher than the highest water level last year, and most of them have now been completed. The masses in Fudong County of the fifth district collected 1,200 cartloads of bricks and rushed to repair three brick dams. Ninghe County repaired a total of 22,487 cubic meters of soil for the banks and dangerous sections of the Fuyang River, the North Hui River, and the Xiao Zhang River, which has now been completed. Renxian, Zhentang, and other counties are also actively repairing dikes for flood control.

    After the breach at Dagu Village in Baodi, eastern Hebei, the Jiyun River water has gradually receded, but due to the sudden arrival of mountain floods in the northwest, another breach occurred at Laogaozhai in Baodi on the 19th. The county flood control headquarters immediately organized a rescue effort. The embankment was completed on the 20th. It is estimated that if there are no major changes in the water situation, the breach can be closed by the end of the month. The main reason for the breach was the leadership's negligence in inspecting the dikes in advance, which led to water seeping through rat holes, causing the disaster.

　　防汛快报
    冀鲁豫黄委会电话队，四个月完成了八百零八里的沿河架线任务，大大便利了防汛工作。该队建自去冬，队员共八十人，多系农民，缺乏技术。经训练及在工作中不断提高，现队员都能掌握一般技术。他们曾完成了横跨黄河架起高空线的光荣任务。近经过总结评模后，员工们一致提出在大汛期间保证电话畅通。

    冀南部分地区霪雨聚水成灾。高唐、恩县等七县被淹洼地十五万亩。当地政府发动群众挖渠疏水后，高唐已救出两万四千亩；恩县仅半天即修渠十余里，一千五百亩良田露土。

    冀南沿河各县群众正赶修堤坝。二专区夏津、恩县、武城、清河四县境内，运河大堤共长五百里，现修筑之河堤高于去年最高水位二至四尺，现已大部完成。五专阜东县群众，集砖一千二百车，赶修砖坝三处。宁河县修补滏阳河、北浍河、小漳河堤岸和险工共二二四八七方土，现已竣工。任县、振堂等县也正积极修堤防汛。

    冀东宝坻大沽村决口后，蓟运河水已逐渐下降，但因西北部山洪骤至，宝坻老高寨十九日又决口一处。县防汛指挥部闻讯后即组织抢堵。二十日埝头已做好。估计水势如无大变化，月底即可合龙。决口原因主要是事先领导上疏于堤岸检查，致水透鼠穴，酿成灾害。
