(Ping City News) The following is the full text of the "July 7th" Commemoration Broadcast Speech given by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, on July 4th at the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station:

　　Fellow countrymen:
　　July 7th is a glorious day for the Chinese people. From the Marco Polo Bridge Incident on July 7, 1937, to today, it has been exactly twelve years! At a time when the People's Liberation War has achieved basic victory, and at a time when the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference has been established, we are welcoming this glorious festival of the people with boundless joy, and celebrating the establishment of the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference.
　　Here, let us express our deep condolences to the soldiers and civilians who heroically sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance Against Japan! Let us express our highest respect to the People's Liberation Army, who are marching arduously in this sweltering heat for the liberation of the whole country!
　　The great goal of the War of Resistance Against Japan, like the People's Liberation War, is to defend the independence, democracy, and happiness of the people's motherland. For this great goal, the soldiers and civilians of the whole country fought heroically and unyieldingly for eight years, and finally achieved the final victory, expelling the Japanese invaders from our territory.
　　This is an immortal epic that is both moving and shocking to the world! This is a great epic written by the loyal and righteous soldiers and civilians of the whole country with their blood, tears, and lives!
　　From the day of July 7th, the entire Chinese people, regardless of men, women, old or young, regardless of the front or the rear, stood up and waged an unprecedentedly great war to defend the people's motherland, curbing the ferocious flames of the Japanese invaders' aggression, and impressing the people of the world, who praised us unanimously. Today, when we think of the heroic deeds of the loyal and righteous soldiers and civilians of that time, and think of the inhumane burning and massacres of the Japanese invaders, we still feel glory, and we still feel pain and indignation!
　　Glory belongs to the people, and not to Chiang Kai-shek and his diehard clique for their private gain. During the War of Resistance, what Chiang Kai-shek said was united resistance, but in reality, he was undermining united resistance; he used the excuse of resistance to carry out fascist dictatorship, suppress the people, and suppress democratic parties. Chiang Kai-shek's elite troops were not used for resistance against Japan, but for preventing the Communists, and for eliminating dissidents. Moreover, he abandoned territory and people, and conspired to surrender and compromise. If it were not for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the adherence of democratic and patriotic people to the anti-Japanese national united front, and if it were not for the large-scale guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines led by the Chinese Communist Party, China's War of Resistance Against Japan would probably have ended tragically long ago, and there would be no situation today!
　　Although the facts are like this, Chiang Kai-shek "greedily took the credit of Heaven as his own effort," and after the victory of the War of Resistance, he disregarded the public opinion of the people of the whole country, and disregarded the sincerity of the Chinese Communist Party and various democratic parties and progressive people in enduring for the sake of the country, and openly violated the Kuomintang-Communist truce agreement, tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and launched a counter-revolutionary civil war. Domestically, he implemented white terror, persecuted democrats, and massacred workers and students; externally, he willingly served as a running dog of American imperialism, selling out territory and sovereignty, and surrendering naval bases, determined to drag China into a desperate situation!
　　Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party has won victories in the three-year Liberation War, and has now basically defeated Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule; the time for eliminating the remaining reactionary forces is not far away. But we must not forget Chairman Mao's words: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their defeat on this land of China, and they will still collude with each other, using all possible means, to oppose the Chinese people." Therefore, "we must never relax our vigilance against the crazy revenge schemes of the imperialist elements and their running dogs because of victory."
　　Very obviously, as a result of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese imperialism has fallen. What has replaced it is American imperialism. It threatens the independence, democracy, and happiness of the Chinese people. For three years, American imperialism has not only used a large amount of military fire, money, technology, and military talent to assist the Chinese reactionaries to massacre the Chinese people, but also actively supported Japan, allowing the Japanese nation to act as a robber and cannon fodder for the United States in the Far East. Recently, it has become even more intensified, and it does not hesitate to unilaterally stop Japan's reparations to China, refuses the Soviet Union's proposal to invite China to discuss the preparation of a peace treaty with Japan, and attempts to seize our country's Taiwan and Hainan Island as permanent sea and air force bases for the United States. These aggressive conspiracies are absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.
　　Eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and three years of the Liberation War have sacrificed countless martyrs' heads and blood, and sacrificed countless people's lives and property, in exchange for the victory of the War of Resistance and the achievement of today's liberation. The people of the whole country must not let the blood of the martyrs flow in vain, and must not let the conspiracies of American imperialism and its running dogs be realized!
　　On the day the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference was established, Jishen said this: "The preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference is the beginning of building a new China that meets the aspirations of the people, and we are participating with great joy and excitement. This beginning is actually a great revolutionary fruit." How can we ensure this great revolutionary fruit? The people of the whole country must unite more closely under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, convene the New Political Consultative Conference as soon as possible, establish a democratic coalition government, eliminate the remaining reactionary forces, and build a new democratic China!
　　The current domestic and international situation requires us to carry out the following main tasks, that is: resolutely oppose American imperialism's unilateral cessation of Japan's reparations to China; resolutely oppose American imperialism's annexation of Taiwan; endorse Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Japan quickly in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, and prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression! Promote Japan's democratization! Only in this way can we be worthy of the tens of millions of soldiers and civilians who died, and can we ensure the great revolutionary fruit!

### 纪念“七七”  李济深播讲词

　　纪念“七七”
    李济深播讲词
    【平市讯】中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深七月四日在北平新华广播电台讲的“七七”纪念广播词，全文如下：全国同胞们：
    七七是中国人民光荣的日子。从一九三七年七月七日芦沟桥炮响到今天，整整十二年了！正当人民解放战争取得基本胜利的时候，正当新政治协商会议筹备会成立的时候，我们是以无限欢欣的心情来迎接这个人民光荣的节日，来庆祝新政治协商会议筹备会的成立的。
    在这里，让我们对于为抗日战争而英勇牺牲的死难军民，致其深切的悼念！让我们对于为着解放全国而溽暑长征的人民解放军致其崇高的敬意！
    抗日战争的伟大目标，如同人民解放战争一样，是在于保卫人民祖国的独立、民主、幸福的。为了这一伟大目标，全国军民英勇抗战百折不挠，历时八年，终于获致最后胜利，驱逐日寇出境。
    这是可歌可泣，震撼中外的不朽史诗！这是全国忠义军民用血泪和生命写下的伟大史诗！
    从七七那天起全中国人民无分男女老幼，无分前方后方的挺身而起，进行了空前伟大的保卫人民祖国的战争，遏阻了日寇侵略的凶焰，叫全世界人士刮目相看，交口称颂。到今天我们想起了当年忠义军民的英雄事迹，想起了日寇惨无人道的焚烧屠杀，犹感到光荣，犹感到痛愤！
    光荣是属于人民的，而非蒋介石及其死党所得而私。抗战期间，蒋介石口里说的是团结抗战，实际上是破坏团结抗战；他借口抗战而厉行法西斯独裁，压制人民，压制民主党派。蒋介石的精锐部队不用之于抗日，而用之于防共，用之于诛锄异己。犹复弃地弃民，阴谋投降妥协。假如当年没有中共的领导以及民主爱国人士的坚持抗日民族统一战线，没有中共领导的大规模的敌后游击战争，中国抗日战争恐怕早就悲惨完结，更不会有今天的局面了！
    事实虽然如此，而蒋贼却“贪天之功以为己力”，于抗战胜利之后，竟不顾全国人民公意，不念中共以及各民主党派各进步人士相忍为国之诚，公然破坏国共停战协定，撕毁政协决议，发动反革命的内战。对内则实施白色恐怖，迫害民主人士，残杀工人和学生；对外则甘为美帝走狗，出卖领土主权，拱让海军基地，务把中国拖到绝境！
    幸而中共领导的人民解放大军，在三年解放战争中节节胜利，现已基本上打垮了蒋介石的反动统治；反动残余力量，肃清之期，已在不远。但是可不要忘记中共毛主席的话：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的，他们还会要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。”所以“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性。”
    非常明显的，对日抗战胜利的结果，日本帝国主义倒下了。代之而来的是美帝国主义。它威胁着中国人民的独立、民主、幸福。三年以来，美帝国主义不仅仅以大量军火金钱技术及军事的人才援助中国反动派，来屠杀中国人民，并且积极扶助日本，让日本民族替美国在远东作强盗，当炮灰。最近更变本加厉，竟不惜单独的停止日本对华赔偿，拒绝苏联建议邀请中国讨论准备对日和约，并妄图攫取我国的台湾、海南岛作为美国永久性的海空军的基地。凡此侵略阴谋，绝非中国人民所能容忍。
    八年对日抗战，三年解放战争，牺牲了无数烈士头颅鲜血，牺牲了无数人民生命财产，才换得抗战的胜利，才获致今天的解放。全国人民决不能让烈士的血白流，决不能让美帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋实现！
    在新政治协商会议筹备会成立的当天，济深曾这样的说：“新政治协商会议筹备会是建设一个符合人民愿望的新中国的开始，我们是以非常的欢欣鼓舞的心情来参加的。这一个开始其实就是一个伟大的革命果实。”我们怎样确保这一个伟大的革命果实呢？我们全国人民必须在中共毛主席领导之下更加紧密的团结，迅速召开新政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府，肃清残余反动力量，建设新民主的中国！
    当前国内外的形势，要求我们进行以下的主要工作，这就是：坚决反对美帝国主义单独地停止日本对华赔偿；坚决反对美帝国主义吞占台湾；赞同苏外长维辛斯基的建议，迅速按照波茨坦协定，缔结对日和约，防止日本侵略势力抬头！促进日本民主化！也唯有这样才对得起千万死难军民，才能确保伟大革命果实！
