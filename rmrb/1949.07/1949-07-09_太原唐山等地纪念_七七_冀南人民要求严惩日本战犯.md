　　Taiyuan, Tangshan and other places commemorate "July 7th"
　　People of southern Hebei demand severe punishment for Japanese war criminals

[Comprehensive report from this newspaper] The citizens of Taiyuan warmly commemorated the 12th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War. The city was filled with the sounds of gongs and drums all day long, and stilt walkers and Yangko dancers performed everywhere. Mayor Pei Lisheng, at a grand commemorative meeting attended by more than 20,000 people, called on all Taiyuan citizens to unite, eliminate the hidden reactionary remnants, and strive to build a new Taiyuan for the people.

From "July 1st" to "July 7th," Tangshan City held a commemorative week. The Tangshan Municipal Committee sent people to give lectures in factories, mines, government offices, and schools. Various middle schools also formed several propaganda teams to take to the streets to conduct propaganda activities about "July 1st" and "July 7th." The Kailuan Tangshan Mine workers' wall newspaper issued a special edition; workers at the East Repair Machine Factory spent one hour of their spare time each day studying documents such as "From 'September 18th' to 'July 7th.'"

People from all walks of life in towns and villages in the southern Hebei region generally held commemorative meetings and discussion forums for the 12th anniversary of the Anti-Japanese War. According to incomplete statistics from the region, the damage caused to the people of the area by the Japanese invaders during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, including deaths, injuries, those seized to serve as forced laborers and those conscripted for labor service, reached more than 1.07 million people. 1.28 million houses were burned down, and more than 500,000 head of livestock were lost. As a result, agricultural production in the area decreased from an average of 250 jin per mu before the war to 80 jin per mu after the war. At this year's commemorative meetings in various places in the region, the masses still felt the pain and demanded severe punishment for Japanese war criminals, demanded that Japan compensate for the losses, eradicate fascism, and realize a democratic Japan.
