[Ping City News] The Third Enlarged Committee Meeting of the North China People's Government, which began on the 25th of this month, concluded on the evening of the 27th after three days. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Dong Biwu gave a report on the current situation and an assessment of the government's work. Subsequently, Vice Chairman Bo Yibo, Minister of Education Chao Zhefu, and Minister of Justice Xie Juezai gave reports on financial and economic work, cultural and educational work, and political work, respectively. The meeting also heard a speech by Deputy Minister of Civil Affairs Lei Renmin on his views on the current rural political construction work, and a statement by Director of the Labor Bureau Li Zaiwen on the suggestions made to the government by the North China Workers' Representative Conference. Regarding the decision made by the government committee's interim meeting in April to organize two specialized groups to study the issues of North China's administrative divisions and changes in the organizational structure of the government, the conveners of the two groups, Vice Chairman Yang Xiufeng and Vice Chairman Bo Yibo, also presented the results of their research at this meeting.

On the afternoon of the 26th, the government committee members, heads of various departments, and heads of administrative offices, provinces, and cities attending the meeting were divided into five groups to review and discuss Chairman Dong's report, the reports on finance, economics, culture, education, and political and legal affairs, and rural political construction work. On the 27th, each group submitted its review opinions to the general assembly for discussion, and everyone supplemented them with their speeches. The meeting unanimously agreed that in this period, the government's work, such as supporting the war, fighting drought and planting crops, disaster relief and flood prevention, building railways and highways, restoring and developing primary school education, initially establishing local health work, and strengthening rural public security work, had made many achievements, which showed that the government's work since the second committee meeting was oriented towards the countryside. The meeting also specifically mentioned the two serious shortcomings pointed out by Chairman Dong, believing that political paralysis existed seriously in some aspects and must be given serious attention and determined to overcome it quickly. The tendency of some bureaucratic work styles should also be thoroughly examined and earnestly improved. In terms of rural political construction, everyone believed that after land reform and party rectification in rural areas, democratic forces and democratic implementation had greatly developed. The current rural political construction issue is to further deepen the implementation of the people's democratic dictatorship, and the key lies in mobilizing the people and relying on the people. Therefore, in practice, it is necessary to overcome the problem of formalism and conform to the wishes and demands of the people. At the same time, it was believed that rural political construction work is not a short-term shock, but should be infiltrated into various tasks and carried out on a daily basis.

In addition, Zang Boping, Deputy Mayor of Shijiazhuang, introduced the convening of the city's People's Representative Conference. Han Zheyi, Deputy Director of the Hebei-Luyu Administrative Office, raised the issue of the burden of rural sideline occupations and the Yellow River management plan. Deputy Minister of Civil Affairs Lei Renmin talked about the work of preferential treatment and farming assistance in the rear as the army moved forward. Deputy Ministers of Health Zhu Lian and Liu Heyi proposed that rural health work should be popularized and developed; they also made suggestions on reforming traditional Chinese medicine, uniting Chinese and Western medicine, reforming old-style midwifery, and how to establish medical and pharmaceutical cooperatives. Committee member Jia Xinzhai expressed great satisfaction with the work of the North China People's Government, pointing out that the achievements of the government's work were primarily due to the correct leadership of Chairman Dong. In the general discussion, Vice Chairman Lan Gongwu, Committee Member Xing Youtang, and Committee Member Rong Zihe all called for attention to the government's maintenance of a hard-working and simple style and the implementation of streamlining and thrift.

Finally, the meeting gave principled approval to the comprehensive review opinions of the government's various work reports and passed important resolutions on changing the administrative divisions of North China and on the organizational structure and personnel appointments of the Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan Provincial People's Governments. Before the closing of the meeting, Chairman Dong summarized the meeting and reiterated the issue of overcoming the bureaucratic work style in the government's work; North China will implement democratic political construction in rural areas in the future, and all localities must pay attention to overcoming formalism; regarding the issue of government work cadres, Chairman Dong emphasized that Party members and non-Party members should unite and cooperate and work together.

　　华北人民政府委员会议闭会
  　通过重要决议
    确定变更华北行政区划及河北山西平原省府组织机构等
    【平市讯】华北人民政府第三次委员会扩大会议自本月二十五日起，历时三天，已于二十七日晚闭会。会议首由董必武主席作关于目前形势及政府工作估计的报告，继由薄一波副主席、教育晁哲甫部长、司法部谢觉哉部长分别作了关于财经工作、文教工作、政治工作的报告。会议并听取了民政部雷任民副部长对于目前农村建政工作意见的发言，劳动局栗再温局长对于华北职工代表会议向政府建议事项的说明。关于今年四月政府委员会临时会议决定组织两专门小组分别研究华北行政区划及本府组织机构变更问题，亦由两组召集人杨秀峰副主席及薄一波副主席于此次会议上先后将研究结果作了报告。
    二十六日下午，出席会议各政府委员、各部门负责人及各行署省市负责人，分成五个小组，对董主席报告与财经、文教、政法等报告及农村建政工作分别进行审查讨论。二十七日各组将审查意见提交大会讨论，并经大家发言补充。会议一致认为这一时期在政府工作中诸如支援战争，抗旱抢种，救灾防汛，修建铁路公路，恢复与发展小学教育，初步建立地方卫生工作，加强农村治安工作等，均有不少成绩，这都说明了委员会第二次会议以来，政府工作是面向农村的。会议又特别提到董主席所指出的两个严重缺点，认为政治麻痹性在某些方面是严重存在着，必须引起大家深刻注意，确定办法，迅速克服。若干官僚主义作风的倾向，亦应深入检查，切实改进。在农村建政方面，大家认为农村经过土地改革与整党，民主力量与民主实施有很大的发展，目前农村建政问题，就是进一步深入地实现人民民主专政问题，其关键在于发动人民群众，依靠人民群众，因此在做法上要克服形式主义的毛病，要适合人民群众的愿望和要求。同时认为农村建政工作不是短期的突击，而要渗透在各工作中去日常进行。
    此外，石家庄市臧伯平副市长介绍该市人民代表会议的召开情形。冀鲁豫行署韩哲一副主任提出农村副业的负担问题及治黄计划。民政部雷任民副部长谈到大军向前进，后方的优抚代耕工作。卫生部朱琏、刘和一两副部长提出农村卫生工作应普及地开展；对改造中医，团结中西医，改造旧式接产及如何建立医药合作社均有所建议。贾心斋委员表示对华北人民政府工作非常满意，他指出政府工作的成绩，首先是由于董主席领导的正确。在大会讨论中，蓝公武副主席，邢有棠委员及戎子和委员等对政府保持艰苦朴素作风及实行精简节约问题，也均提出大家注意。
    会议最后关于大会对政府各工作报告的综合审查意见作了原则通过，并通过关于变更华北行政区划及关于河北、山西、平原省人民政府组织机构与人事任命等重要决议。会议闭幕前，董主席总结此次会议，再次阐明关于克服政府工作中的官僚主义作风问题；华北今后实行农村民主建政，各地必须注意克服形式主义；关于政府工作干部问题，董主席强调指出党员与非党员应团结合作，共同努力。
