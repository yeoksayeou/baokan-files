　　On the People's Democratic Dictatorship
  　——In Commemoration of the 28th Anniversary of the Communist Party of China
    Mao Zedong

    The date, July 1, 1949, signifies that the Communist Party of China has journeyed through twenty-eight years. Like a person, it has its infancy, youth, adulthood, and old age. The Communist Party of China is no longer a child, nor a teenager, but an adult. People die in old age, and so do parties. When classes are eliminated, everything that serves as a tool of class struggle—political parties and state machinery—will gradually decline and end their historical mission, moving towards a more advanced human society, because they will have lost their function and are no longer needed. We are the opposite of bourgeois political parties. They are afraid to talk about the elimination of classes, the elimination of state power, and the elimination of parties. We openly declare that it is precisely for the purpose of creating conditions and striving to eliminate these things. The Communist Party and the state power of the people's dictatorship are such conditions. To deny this truth, is not to be a communist. Young comrades who have just joined the Party and have not read Marxist-Leninist works may not yet understand this truth. They must understand this truth in order to have a correct world outlook. They must understand that the elimination of classes, the elimination of state power, and the elimination of the Party are paths that all mankind must take, the only question is time and conditions. Communists all over the world are more astute than the bourgeoisie; they understand the laws of the survival and development of things, they understand dialectics, and they see further ahead. The reason why the bourgeoisie does not welcome this truth is because they do not want to be overthrown. Being overthrown, such as the current overthrow of the Kuomintang reactionaries by us, and the past overthrow of Japanese imperialism by us and the people of various countries, is painful and unimaginable for those who are overthrown. For the working class, the laboring people, and the Communists, it is not a matter of being overthrown, but of working hard to create conditions so that classes, state power, and political parties will naturally wither away, enabling mankind to enter the realm of Great Harmony (Datong). In order to clarify the issues we are about to discuss below, let us briefly mention the long-term prospect of human progress here.

    Our Party has gone through twenty-eight years, and as everyone knows, it has not been a peaceful journey, but one through difficult circumstances. We have had to fight enemies both at home and abroad, within and outside the Party. Thank you to Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, who gave us weapons. These weapons are not machine guns, but Marxism-Leninism.

    In 1920, in his book "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," Lenin described the process by which the Russians sought revolutionary theory. The Russians had to endure hardship for decades before they found Marxism. Many things in China are the same as, or similar to, Russia before the October Revolution. The oppression of feudalism is the same. Economic and cultural backwardness is similar; both countries are backward, but China is even more backward. Advanced people, in order to revitalize the country, do not hesitate to struggle hard to find revolutionary truth; this is the same.

    Since the defeat in the Opium War of 1840, advanced Chinese people have gone through untold hardships to seek truth from Western countries. Hong Xiuquan, Kang Youwei, Yan Fu, and Sun Yat-sen represented the faction that sought truth from the West before the birth of the Communist Party of China. At that time, Chinese people seeking progress would read any book that contained new Western ideas. The number of students sent to Japan, Britain, the United States, France, and Germany reached an alarming extent. At home, the imperial examination system was abolished, and schools sprang up like mushrooms after a rain, striving to learn from the West. In my youth, I myself studied these things. These were the culture of Western bourgeois democracy, the so-called "new learning," including the social doctrines and natural sciences of that time, and were opposed to the Chinese feudal culture, the so-called "old learning." For a long time, those who learned these new things developed a confidence that they could save China. Apart from the old learning faction, few in the new learning faction expressed doubts themselves. To save the country, there was only reform; to reform, there was only learning from foreign countries. At that time, only the Western capitalist countries were progressive; they had successfully built modern bourgeois states. The Japanese were successful in learning from the West, and the Chinese also wanted to learn from the Japanese. In the eyes of the Chinese at that time, Russia was backward, and few people wanted to learn from Russia. This was the situation of Chinese people learning from foreign countries from the 1840s to the early 20th century.

    The aggression of imperialism shattered the dream of Chinese people learning from the West. It is strange, why is it that teachers are always invading students? Chinese people learned a lot from the West, but it did not work, and ideals could never be realized. The situation in the country got worse day by day, and the environment forced people to be unable to survive. Doubt arose, grew, and developed. The First World War shook the whole world. The Russians carried out the October Revolution and established the world's first socialist state. The great revolutionary energy of the Russian proletariat and laboring people, which had been hidden underground and unseen by foreigners in the past, suddenly erupted like a volcano under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin. Chinese people and all of humanity looked at the Russians with different eyes. Only then, and only at this time, did a brand-new era appear in the thinking and lives of Chinese people. Chinese people found Marxism-Leninism, this universal truth that applies everywhere, and the face of China changed.

    Chinese people found Marxism through the introduction of the Russians. Before the October Revolution, Chinese people not only did not know Lenin and Stalin, but also did not know Marx and Engels. The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October revolution helped the advanced elements all over the world, including China, to use the proletarian world outlook as a tool for observing the destiny of the country and re-considering their own problems. Follow the path of the Russians—this is the conclusion. In 1919, the "May Fourth" Movement took place in China. In 1921, the Communist Party of China was founded. Sun Yat-sen, in despair, encountered the October Revolution and the Communist Party of China. Sun Yat-sen welcomed the October Revolution, welcomed the help of the Russians to the Chinese people, and welcomed the cooperation between the Communist Party of China and him. Sun Yat-sen died, and Chiang Kai-shek rose. In the long period of twenty-two years, Chiang Kai-shek dragged China into a desperate situation. During this period, the anti-fascist Second World War, with the Soviet Union as the main force, defeated three imperialist powers and weakened two imperialist powers. Only one imperialist country, the United States, remained undamaged in the world. However, the domestic crisis in the United States was very deep, and it wanted to enslave the whole world. It used weapons to help Chiang Kai-shek kill millions of Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people, after driving out Japanese imperialism, carried out a three-year People's Liberation War and achieved a basic victory. In this way, the civilization of the Western bourgeoisie, the democracy of the bourgeoisie, and the scheme of the bourgeois republic all went bankrupt in the minds of the Chinese people. Bourgeois democracy gave way to people's democracy led by the proletariat, and the bourgeois republic gave way to the people's republic. This created a possibility: to reach socialism and communism, to reach the elimination of classes and the Great Harmony of the world, through the People's Republic. Kang Youwei wrote the "Book of Great Harmony," but he did not and could not find a path to reach Great Harmony. The bourgeois republic, which existed in foreign countries, cannot exist in China, because China is a country oppressed by imperialism. The only path is to reach the elimination of classes and the Great Harmony of the world through the People's Republic led by the proletariat.

    Everything else has been tried and has failed. Some of those who once cherished other things have fallen, some have awakened, and some are changing their minds. Events have developed so quickly that many people feel surprised and feel the need to re-learn. This mood of people is understandable, and we welcome this kind and demanding attitude of relearning.

    The vanguard of the Chinese proletariat learned Marxism-Leninism after the October Revolution and established the Communist Party of China. Then it entered the political struggle, went through tortuous paths, and finally achieved a basic victory after twenty-eight years. Twenty-eight years of experience, like Sun Yat-sen said in his deathbed testament "forty years of experience," led to the same conclusion, which is: "Deeply understanding that to achieve victory, it is necessary to awaken the masses and unite with those nations in the world that treat us as equals, and struggle together." Sun Yat-sen and we have different world outlooks, and observe and handle problems from different class positions, but in the 1920s, on the issue of how to fight imperialism, we reached such a basically consistent conclusion.

    Twenty-four years have passed since Sun Yat-sen's death, and the theory and practice of the Chinese revolution, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have greatly developed and fundamentally changed the face of China. Up to now, the main and basic experiences that the Chinese people have gained are these two things: (1) Domestically, awaken the masses. That is, unite the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie, form a domestic united front under the leadership of the working class, and from this develop to establish a state of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance; (2) Unite with those nations in the world that treat us as equals and struggle together with the people of various countries. That is, unite with the Soviet Union, unite with the new democratic countries, unite with the proletariat and the broad masses of people of other countries, and form an international united front.

    "You lean to one side." That's right. Leaning to one side is what Sun Yat-sen's forty years of experience and the Communist Party's twenty-eight years of experience have taught us. Deeply understanding that to achieve victory and consolidate victory, it is necessary to lean to one side. Based on forty years and twenty-eight years of experience, the Chinese people will either lean to the side of imperialism or lean to the side of socialism, without exception. Sitting on the fence is not possible, and there is no third road. We oppose the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries who lean to the side of imperialism, and we also oppose the illusion of a third road. Not only China, but the whole world is the same, either leaning to the side of imperialism or leaning to the side of socialism, without exception. Neutrality is disguised, and there is no third road.

    "You are too provocative." What we are talking about is dealing with domestic and foreign reactionaries, i.e., the imperialists and their running dogs, not dealing with anyone else. For these people, the question of provocation or not does not arise, because they are reactionaries. Drawing a clear line between the reactionaries and the revolutionaries, exposing the conspiracies and tricks of the reactionaries, arousing vigilance and attention within the revolutionary ranks, strengthening our own morale, and diminishing the enemy's prestige, can isolate the reactionaries, defeat them, or replace them. In the face of beasts, we must not show the slightest timidity; we must learn from Wu Song on Jingyang Ridge. In Wu Song's view, the tiger on Jingyang Ridge is the same whether you provoke it or not; it is going to eat people anyway. Either kill the tiger or be eaten by the tiger; one of the two must happen.

    "We want to do business." Absolutely right, business must always be done. We only oppose domestic and foreign reactionaries who hinder us from doing business; we do not oppose anyone else. Everyone should know that it is not others, but the imperialists and their running dog, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique, who are hindering us from doing business with foreign countries and even hindering us from establishing diplomatic relations with foreign countries. Unite all forces at home and abroad to defeat the domestic and foreign reactionaries, and we will have business to do, and we will be able to establish diplomatic relations with all countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty.

    "We can win without international aid." This is a wrong idea. In the era of imperialism, the true people's revolution of any country, if it does not have the assistance of international revolutionary forces in various ways, it is impossible to achieve its own victory; even if it is victorious, it is impossible to consolidate it. The victory and consolidation of the great October Revolution were like this; Stalin had already told us this. The Second World War, which defeated three imperialist countries and liberated the countries of Eastern Europe, was also like this. The present and future of the People's China will also be like this. Please think about it, if there were no Soviet Union, if there were no victory in the anti-fascist Second World War, especially the defeat of Japanese imperialism, if there were no emergence of the new democratic countries, if there were no oppressed nations of the East rising up to fight, if there were no struggles between the people of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and other capitalist countries and the reactionaries ruling them, if there were no combination of all these things, then the international reactionary forces piled on our heads would surely be many times greater than they are now. In this situation, could we win? Obviously not. Even if we won, it would be impossible to consolidate our victory. The Chinese people have had too much experience with this. Sun Yat-sen's last words about uniting international revolutionary forces had already reflected this kind of experience.

    "We need the aid of the British and American governments." At present, this is also a naive idea. The rulers of Britain and America are still imperialists; would they give aid to people's countries? Why do we do business with these countries, and why would these countries be willing to lend us money on mutually beneficial terms in the future? This is because the capitalists of these countries want to make money, and the bankers want to earn interest, in order to alleviate their own crises, and it is not aid to the Chinese people. The Communist and progressive parties in these countries are promoting trade with us and even the establishment of diplomatic relations. This is goodwill, and this is aid, and it cannot be compared with the behavior of the bourgeoisie in these countries. During his lifetime, Sun Yat-sen appealed to capitalist countries for aid countless times, but everything came to nothing and he was subjected to ruthless blows. During his lifetime, Sun Yat-sen only received international aid once, and that was the aid from the Soviet Union. Please read Mr. Sun's will; there he earnestly urges people not to look to the aid of imperialist countries, but to "unite with those nations in the world that treat us as equals." Mr. Sun had experience; he had suffered losses and been deceived. We must remember his words and not be deceived again. In the international arena, we belong to the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union; true friendly assistance can only be found in this direction, and not in the direction of the imperialist front.

    "You are dictators." Lovely sirs, you are right; we are exactly like that. All the experience that the Chinese people have accumulated over decades tells us to implement the people's democratic dictatorship, or the people's democratic autocracy; in short, it is the same thing, which is to deprive the reactionaries of the right to speak and only allow the people to have the right to speak.

    Who are the people? In China, at the present stage, they are the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. These classes, united under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, form their own state, elect their own government, and exercise dictatorship and autocracy over the running dogs of imperialism, namely the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, as well as the Kuomintang reactionaries representing these classes and their accomplices. These people are suppressed, only allowed to behave themselves, and not allowed to talk or act recklessly. If they talk or act recklessly, they will be immediately banned and punished. For the people internally, a democratic system is implemented, giving them freedom of speech, assembly, and association. The right to vote is only given to the people, not to the reactionaries. These two aspects, that is, the democratic aspect for the people internally and the dictatorial aspect for the reactionaries, are combined together, which is the people's democratic dictatorship.

    Why should we do this? Everyone knows very well. If we do not do this, the revolution will fail, the people will suffer, and the country will perish.

    "Don't you want to eliminate state power?" We do, but we don't want it now, and we can't want it now. Why? Imperialism still exists, domestic reactionaries still exist, and domestic classes still exist. Our current task is to strengthen the state machinery of the people, which mainly refers to the people's army, the people's police, and the people's courts, in order to protect national defense and protect the interests of the people. This is to serve as a condition to enable China to steadily advance from an agricultural country to an industrial country, from a new democratic society to a socialist and communist society, to eliminate classes and realize Great Harmony under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party. State machinery such as the army, police, and courts are tools for class oppression. For hostile classes, it is a tool of oppression, it is violence, and it is not something "benevolent." "You are not benevolent." That's right. We will never practice benevolence towards the reactionary behavior of the reactionaries and reactionary classes. We only practice benevolence within the people, and not towards the reactionary behavior of the reactionaries and reactionary classes outside the people.

    The people's state is to protect the people. With the people's state, the people have the possibility to educate and transform themselves in a democratic way on a national scale and on a general scale, to free themselves from the influence of domestic and foreign reactionaries (this influence is still very great now and will exist for a long time, and cannot be quickly eliminated), to transform their bad habits and bad ideas from the old society, not to let themselves go astray under the guidance of the reactionaries, and to continue to advance towards socialist society and communist society, to complete the historical task of eliminating classes and entering Great Harmony.

    The method we use in this regard is democratic, that is, the method of persuasion, not the method of coercion. People who break the law will also be punished, will also be imprisoned, and there will also be the death penalty, but this is an individual situation and is different in principle from the dictatorship of the reactionary class as a class.

    For the reactionaries and reactionary people, after their regime is overthrown, as long as they do not rebel, do not sabotage, and do not make trouble, they will also be given work, allowed to live, and allowed to transform themselves in labor and become new people. If they are unwilling to work, the people's state will force them to work. Political work and propaganda and education work will also be done for them, and they will be done very carefully and fully, just as we have done for the captured officers. This is also practicing benevolence, but we will never forgive their reactionary behavior, and will never allow their reactionary behavior to have the possibility of free development.

    This kind of transformation work for the reactionary classes can only be done by a state of people's democratic dictatorship. When this work is done well, the main exploiting classes in China—the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie—will be finally eliminated. Remaining is the national bourgeoisie, and at the present stage, much appropriate education work can be carried out for many people among them. When socialism is implemented, that is, when private enterprises are nationalized, further education and transformation work will be carried out for them. The people have a powerful state machine in their hands and are not afraid of the national bourgeoisie rebelling.

    The serious problem is the education of the peasants. The peasant economy is dispersed, and according to the experience of the Soviet Union, it takes a long time and careful work to achieve the socialization of agriculture. Without the socialization of agriculture, there is no complete and consolidated socialism. And in order to socialize agriculture, it is necessary to develop a powerful industry dominated by state-owned enterprises. The state of people's democratic dictatorship must solve this problem step by step. This article does not intend to discuss economic issues in detail, so I will not elaborate here for the time being.

    In 1924, the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, personally directed by Sun Yat-sen and attended by communists, passed a famous declaration. This declaration stated: "The so-called civil rights systems of modern countries are often exclusively owned by the bourgeoisie and have become tools for oppressing the common people. The civil rights doctrine of the Kuomintang, however, is shared by the general common people and cannot be privately owned by a few." Apart from the question of who leads whom, as a political program, the civil rights doctrine stated here is in line with the people's democratic dictatorship that we are currently implementing.

    Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Sun Yat-sen and took the dictatorship of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and the landlord class as a tool to oppress the Chinese common people. This counter-revolutionary dictatorship was implemented for twenty-two years, and now it has been overthrown by the Chinese common people led by us.

    The foreign reactionaries who scold us for practicing "dictatorship" or "totalitarianism" are the very people who practice dictatorship or totalitarianism. They implement a class dictatorship, a class totalitarianism of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat and other people. The bourgeoisie of modern countries that Sun Yat-sen spoke of oppressing the common people refers to these people. Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary dictatorship was learned from these reactionary guys.

    The Song Dynasty philosopher Zhu Xi wrote many books and said many things, which everyone has forgotten, but one sentence has not been forgotten: "Treat others as they treat you." This is what we are doing, that is, treating the imperialists and their running dog, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique, as they treat the imperialists and their running dog, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique. That's all, what else is there!
    The revolutionary dictatorship and the counter-revolutionary dictatorship are opposite in nature, and the former is learned from the latter. This learning is very important. If the revolutionary people do not learn this method of treating the counter-revolutionaries, they cannot maintain their regime, their regime will be overthrown by domestic and foreign reactionaries, domestic and foreign reactionaries will be restored in China, and the revolutionary people will suffer.
    The basis of the people’s democratic dictatorship is the alliance of the working class, the peasant class, and the urban petty bourgeoisie, and mainly the alliance of the workers and peasants, because these two classes account for 80 to 90 percent of the Chinese population. Overthrowing imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries mainly relied on the strength of these two classes. From new democracy to socialism, we mainly rely on the alliance of these two classes.
    The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class is the most farsighted, selfless, and has the most thorough revolutionary spirit. The entire revolutionary history proves that without the leadership of the working class, the Revolution will fail; with the leadership of the working class, the Revolution will succeed. In the era of imperialism, no other class in any country can lead any true revolution to victory. The Chinese national bourgeoisie has led revolutions many times, and they have all failed, which is clear proof.
    The national bourgeoisie has great importance in the present stage. We still have imperialism standing beside us, and this enemy is very fierce. It will take a long time for China to achieve true economic independence. Only when China’s industry develops and China is no longer economically dependent on foreign countries will it have true independence. China's modern industry is very small in proportion to the entire national economy. There are no reliable figures yet. According to certain materials, modern industry accounts for only about 10 percent of the total output of the national economy. In order to deal with the oppression of imperialism and to raise the backward economic position a step further, China must utilize all urban and rural capitalist factors that are beneficial to the national economy and the people’s livelihood and not harmful, unite the national bourgeoisie, and strive together. Our current policy is to restrict capitalism, not to eliminate it. However, the national bourgeoisie cannot act as the leader of the revolution, nor can it occupy a major position in the state power. The reason why the national bourgeoisie cannot act as the leader of the revolution and why it should not occupy a major position in the state power organs is because the social and economic position of the national bourgeoisie determines their weakness, their lack of foresight, their lack of sufficient courage, and many of them are afraid of the masses.
    Sun Yat-sen advocated "awakening the masses" or "supporting the farmers and workers." Who should "awaken" and "support" them? Sun Yat-sen meant the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. But this is actually impossible. Sun Yat-sen’s forty years of revolution failed. What is the reason? In the era of imperialism, the bourgeoisie cannot lead any true revolution to victory, and that is the reason.
    Our twenty-eight years are very different. We have many valuable experiences. A disciplined party armed with the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, which adopts the method of self-criticism and is in contact with the masses. An army led by such a party. A united front of all revolutionary classes and all revolutionary factions led by such a party. These three are the main experiences. These are what distinguish us from our predecessors. Relying on these three, we have achieved a basic victory. We have traveled a tortuous road. We have fought against opportunist tendencies within the Party, both right and left. Whenever we made serious mistakes in these three things, the revolution suffered setbacks. Mistakes and setbacks have taught us and made us relatively smarter, and we have handled our affairs better. Any political party, any individual, mistakes are always unavoidable, and we ask to make fewer mistakes. When mistakes are made, we ask to correct them as quickly, thoroughly, and well as possible.
    Summarizing our experience, concentrating on the point, is the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party) and based on the alliance of workers and peasants—this is our formula, this is our main experience, this is our main program.
    The Party's twenty-eight years is a long period, and we have only done one thing, which is to achieve a basic victory. This is worth celebrating, because it is the victory of the people, because it is a victory in such a large country as China. But we still have many things to do. For example, when walking, the past work is only like completing the first step of the Long March. The remaining enemies are waiting for us to wipe them out. Serious economic construction tasks are before us. Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle, and some of the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do them. This is the difficulty. The imperialists calculated that we could not do a good job in the economy. They stood aside to watch and waited for our failure.

    We must overcome difficulties, and we must learn what we do not understand. We must learn economic work from all experts (no matter who they are). Take them as teachers, learn respectfully, and learn honestly. If you don't understand, you don't understand; don't pretend to understand. Don't put on bureaucratic airs. Dig in, a few months, a year or two, three or five years, and you can always learn it. The Soviet Communists also didn't know much about economic management at the beginning, and the imperialists also waited for their failure. But the CPSU was victorious. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, they were not only good at revolution, but also good at construction. They have already built a great, glorious, and brilliant socialist country. The CPSU is our best teacher, and we must learn from the CPSU. We can completely rely on the weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship, unite all the people in the country except the reactionaries, and steadily reach our destination.

　　论人民民主专政
  　——纪念中国共产党二十八周年
    毛泽东
    一九四九年的七月一日这一个日子表示，中国共产党已经走过了二十八年了。象一个人一样，有他的幼年，青年，壮年和老年。中国共产党已经不是小孩子，也不是十几岁的年青小伙子，而是一个大人了。人到老年就要死亡，党也是这样。阶级消灭了，作为阶级斗争的工具的一切东西，政党和国家机器，将因其丧失作用，没有需要，逐步地衰亡下去，完结自己的历史使命，而走到更高级的人类社会。我们和资产阶级政党相反。他们怕说阶级的消灭，国家权力的消灭，和党的消灭。我们则公开声明，恰是为着促使这些东西的消灭而创设条件，而努力奋斗。共产党和人民专政的国家权力，就是这样的条件。不承认这一条真理，就不是共产主义者。没有读过马克思列宁主义的刚才进党的青年同志们，也许还不懂得这一条真理。他们必须懂得这一条真理，才有正确的宇宙观。他们必须懂得，消灭阶级，消灭国家权力，消灭党，全人类都要走这一条路的，问题只是时间和条件。全世界共产主义者比资产阶级高明，他们懂得事物的生存和发展的规律，他们懂得辩证法，他们看得远些。资产阶级所以不欢迎这一条真理，是因为他们不愿意被人们推翻。被推翻，例如眼前国民党反动派被我们所推翻，过去日本帝国主义被我们及各国人民所推翻，对于被推翻者来说，这是痛苦的，不堪设想的。工人阶级，劳动人民和共产党人，则不是什么被推翻的问题，而是努力工作，创设条件，使阶级、国家权力和政党很自然地归于消灭，使人类进到大同境域。为着说清我们在下面所要说的问题，在这里顺便提一下这个人类进步的远景的问题。
    我们党走过二十八年了，大家知道，不是和平地走过的，而是在困难的环境中走过的，我们要和国内外党内外的敌人作战。谢谢马克思，恩格斯，列宁和斯大林，他们给了我们以武器。这武器不是机关枪，而是马克思列宁主义。
    列宁在一九二○年在左派幼稚病一书中描写过俄国人寻找革命理论的经过。俄国人曾经在几十个年头内，经历艰难困苦，方才找到了马克思主义。中国有许多事情和十月革命以前的俄国相同，或者近似。封建主义的压迫，这是相同的。经济和文化落后，这是近似的，两个国家都落后，中国则更落后。先进的人们，为了使国家复兴，不惜艰苦奋斗，寻找革命真理，这是相同的。
    自从一八四○年鸦片战争失败那时起，先进的中国人，经过千辛万苦，向西方国家寻找真理。洪秀全，康有为，严复和孙中山，代表了在中国共产党出世以前向西方寻找真理的一派人物。那时，求进步的中国人，只要是西方的新道理，什么书也看。向日本，英国，美国，法国，德国派遣留学生之多，达到了惊人的程度。国内废科举，兴学校，好象雨后春笋，努力学习西方。我自己在青年时期，学的也是这些东西。这些是西方资产阶级民主主义的文化，即所谓新学，包括那时的社会学说和自然科学，和中国封建主义的文化即所谓旧学是对立的。学了这些新学的人们，在很长的时期内产生了一种信心，认为这些很可以救中国，除了旧学派，新学派自己表示怀疑的很少。要救国，只有维新，要维新，只有学外国。那时的外国只有西方资本主义国家是进步的，他们成功地建设了资产阶级的现代国家。日本人向西方学习有成效，中国人也想向日本人学。在那时的中国人看来，俄国是落后的，很少人想学俄国。这就是十九世纪四十年代至二十世纪初期中国人学习外国的情形。
    帝国主义的侵略打破了中国人学西方的迷梦。很奇怪，先生为什么老是侵略学生呢？中国人向西方学得很不少，但是行不通，理想总是不能实现。国家的情况一天一天坏，环境迫使人们活不下去。怀疑产生了，增长了，发展了。第一次世界大战震动了全世界。俄国人举行了十月革命，创立了世界上第一个社会主义国家。过去蕴藏在地下为外国人所看不见的伟大的俄国无产阶级及劳动人民的革命精力，在列宁斯大林领导之下，象火山一样地突然爆发出来了，中国人和全人类对俄国人都另眼相看了。这时，也只是在这时，中国人从思想到生活，才出现了一个崭新的时期。中国人找到了马克思列宁主义这个放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，中国的面目就起了变化了。
    中国人找到马克思主义，是经过俄国人介绍的。在十月革命以前，中国人不但不知道列宁，斯大林，也不知道马克思，恩格斯。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。一九一九年，中国发生了“五四”运动。一九二一年，中国共产党成立。孙中山在绝望里，遇到了十月革命和中国共产党。孙中山欢迎十月革命，欢迎俄国人对中国人的帮助，欢迎中国共产党和他合作。孙中山死了，蒋介石起来。在二十二年的长时间中，蒋介石把中国拖到了绝境。在这个时期中，以苏联为主力军的反法西斯的第二次世界大战，打倒了三个帝国主义大国，削弱了两个帝国主义大国，世界上只剩下一个帝国主义国家即美国没有损失。而美国的国内危机是很深重的，它要奴役全世界，它用武器帮助蒋介石杀戮了几百万中国人。中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，在驱逐日本帝国主义之后，进行了三年的人民解放战争，取得了基本的胜利。就是这样，西方资产阶级的文明，资产阶级的民主主义，资产阶级共和国的方案，在中国人民的心目中，一齐破了产。资产阶级的民主主义让位给无产阶级领导的人民民主主义，资产阶级共和国让位给人民共和国。这样就造成了一种可能性：经过人民共和国到达社会主义和共产主义，到达阶级的消灭和世界的大同。康有为著了“大同书”，他没有也不可能找到一条到达大同的路。资产阶级的共和国，外国有过的，中国不能有，因为中国是受帝国主义压迫的国家。唯一的路是经过无产阶级领导的人民共和国，到达阶级的消灭和世界的大同。
    一切别的东西都试过了，都失败了。曾经留恋过别的东西的人们，有些倒下去了，有些觉悟过来了，有些正在换脑筋。事变是发展得这样快，以至使很多人感到突然，感到要重新学习。人们的这种心情是可以理解的，我们欢迎这种善良的要求重新学习的态度。
    中国无产阶级的先锋队，在十月革命以后学了马克思列宁主义，建立了中国共产党。接着就进入政治斗争，经过曲折的道路，走了二十八年，方才取得了基本的胜利。积二十八年的经验，如同孙中山在其临终遗嘱里所说“积四十年之经验”一样，得到了一个相同的结论，即是：“深知欲达到胜利，必须唤起民众，及联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗。”孙中山和我们具有各不相同的宇宙观，从不同的阶级立场出发去观察和处理问题，但在二十世纪二十年代，在怎样和帝国主义作斗争的问题上，却和我们达到了这样一个基本上一致的结论。
    孙中山死去二十四年了，中国革命的理论和实践，在中国共产党领导之下，都大大地向前发展了，根本上变换了中国的面目。到现在为止，中国人民已经取得的主要的和基本的经验，就是这两件事：（一）在国内，唤起民众。这就是团结工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，在工人阶级领导之下，结成国内的统一战线，并由此发展到建立工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家；（二）联合世界上以平等待我之民族及各国人民共同奋斗。这就是联合苏联、联合各新民主国家、联合其他各国的无产阶级及广大人民，结成国际的统一战线。
    “你们一边倒”。正是这样。一边倒，是孙中山的四十年经验和共产党的二十八年经验教给我们的，深知欲达到胜利和巩固胜利，必须一边倒。积四十年和二十八年的经验，中国人民不是倒向帝国主义一边，就是倒向社会主义一边，绝无例外。骑墙是不行的，第三条道路是没有的。我们反对倒向帝国主义一边的蒋介石反动派，我们也反对第三条道路的幻想。不但中国，全世界也一样，不是倒向帝国主义，就是倒向社会主义，绝无例外。中立是伪装的，第三条道路是没有的。
    “你们太刺激了”。我们讲的是对付国内外反动派即帝国主义者及其走狗们，不是讲对付任何别的人。对于这些人，并不发生刺激与否的问题，刺激也是那样，不刺激也是那样，因为他们是反动派。划清反动派和革命派的界限，揭露反动派的阴谋诡计，引起革命派内部的警觉和注意，长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风，才能孤立反动派，战而胜之，或取而代之。在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦，我们要学景阳冈上的武松。在武松看来，景阳冈上的老虎，刺激它也是那样，不刺激它也是那样，总之是要吃人的。或者把老虎打死，或者被老虎吃掉，二者必居其一。
    “我们要做生意”。完全正确，生意总是要做的。我们只反对妨碍我们做生意的内外反动派，此外并不反对任何人。大家须知，妨碍我们和外国做生意以至妨碍我们和外国建立外交关系的，不是别人，正是帝国主义者及其走狗蒋介石反动派。团结国内国际的一切力量击破内外反动派，我们就有生意可做了，我们就有可能在平等互利和互相尊重领土主权的基础之上和一切国家建立外交关系了。
    “不要国际援助也可以胜利”。这是错误的想法。在帝国主义存在的时代，任何国家的真正的人民革命，如果没有国际革命力量在各种不同方式上的援助，要取得自己的胜利是不可能的；胜利了，要巩固，也是不可能的。伟大的十月革命的胜利和巩固，就是这样的，斯大林早已告诉我们了。第二次世界大战打倒三个帝国主义国家并解放东欧各国，也是这样。人民中国的现在和将来，也是这样。请大家想一想，假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，对于我们来说特别是打倒了日本帝国主义，假如没有各新民主国家的出现，假如没有东方各被压迫民族正在起来斗争，假如没有美国、英国、法国、德国、意大利、日本等等资本主义国家内部的人民大众和统治他们的反动派之间的斗争，假如没有这一切的综合，那么，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力必定比现在不知要多几多倍，在这种情形下，我们能够胜利么？显然是不能的。胜利了，要巩固，也不可能。这件事，中国人民的经验是太多了。孙中山临终时讲的那句联合国际革命力量的话，早已反映了这一种经验。
    “我们需要英美政府的援助”。在现时，这也是幼稚的想法。现时英美的统治者还是帝国主义者，他们会给人民国家以援助吗？我们同这些国家做生意以及假设这些国家在将来愿意在互利的条件之下借钱给我们，这是因为什么呢？这是因为这些国家的资本家要赚钱，银行家要赚利息，借以解救他们自己的危机，并不是什么对中国人民的援助。这些国家的共产党和进步党派，正在促成和我们做生意以至建立外交关系。这是善意的，这就是援助，这和这些国家的资产阶级的行为，不能相提并论。孙中山的一生中，曾经无数次地向资本主义国家呼吁过援助，结果一切落空，反而遭到了无情的打击。在孙中山一生中，只得过一次国际的援助，这就是苏联的援助。请读者们看一看孙先生的遗嘱罢，他在那里谆谆嘱咐人们的，不是叫人们把眼光向着期待帝国主义国家的援助，而是叫人们“联合世界上以平等待我之民族”。孙先生有了经验了，他吃过亏，上过当。我们要记得他的话，不要再上当。我们在国际上是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线一方面的，真正的友谊的援助只能向这一方面去找，而不能向帝国主义战线一方面去找。
    “你们独裁”。可爱的先生们，你们讲对了，我们正是这样。中国人民在几十年中积累起来的一切经验，都叫我们实行人民民主专政，或曰人民民主独裁，总之是一样，就是剥夺反动派的发言权，只让人民有发言权。
    人民是什么？在中国，在现在阶段，是工人阶级，农民阶级，小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，这些阶级在工人阶级及共产党的领导之下，团结起来，组成自己的国家，选举自己的政府，向着帝国主义的走狗即地主阶级和官僚资产阶级以及代表这些阶级的国民党反动派及其帮凶们实行专政，实行独裁，压迫这些人，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。如要乱说乱动，立即取缔，予以制裁。对于人民内部，则实行民主制度，给予言论集会结社等项的自由权。选举权，只给人民，不给反动派。这两方面，即是说对人民内部的民主方面和对反动派的专政方面，互相结合起来，就是人民民主专政。
    为什么理由要这样做？大家很清楚。不这样，革命就要失败，人民就要遭殃，国家就要灭亡。
    “你们不是要消灭国家权力吗”？我们要，但是我们现在还不要，我们现在还不能要。为什么？帝国主义还存在，国内反动派还存在，国内阶级还存在。我们现在的任务是要强化人民的国家机器，这主要是指人民的军队，人民的警察和人民的法庭，借以保护国防和保护人民利益，以此作为条件，使中国有可能在工人阶级及共产党的领导之下稳步地由农业国进到工业国，由新民主主义社会进到社会主义社会与共产主义社会，消灭阶级和实现大同。军队、警察、法庭等项国家机器，是阶级压迫阶级的工具。对于敌对的阶级，它是压迫的工具，它是暴力，并不是什么“仁慈”的东西。“你们不仁”。正是这样。我们对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施仁政。我们仅仅施仁政于人民内部，而不施于人民外部的反动派和反动阶级的反动行为。
    人民的国家是保护人民的。有了人民的国家，人民才有可能在全国范围内和全体规模上用民主的方法教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响（这个影响现在还是很大的，并将在长时期内存在着，不能很快地消灭），改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，不使自己走入反动派指引的错误路上去，并继续前进，向着社会主义社会和共产主义社会发展，完成消灭阶级和进入大同的历史任务。
    我们在这方面使用的方法，是民主的即说服的方法，而不是强迫的方法。人民犯了法，也要处罚，也要坐班房，也有死刑，但这是个别的情形，和对于反动阶级当作一个阶级的专政来说，有原则的区别。
    对于反动阶级和反动派的人们，在他们的政权被推翻以后，只要他们不造反，不破坏，不捣乱，也给工作，让他们活下去，让他们在劳动中改造自己，成为新人。他们如果不愿意劳动，人民的国家就要强迫他们劳动。也对他们做政治工作，做宣传教育工作，并且做的很用心，很充分，象我们对俘虏军官们已经做过的那样。这也是施仁政，但我们决不宽恕他们的反动行为，决不让他们的反动行为有自由发挥的可能性。
    这种对于反动阶级的改造工作，只有人民民主专政的国家才能做到。这件工作做好了，中国的主要的剥削阶级——地主阶级和官僚资产阶级就最后地消灭了。剩下一个民族资产阶级，在现阶段就可以向他们中间的许多人们进行许多适当的教育工作。等到实行社会主义即实行私人企业国有化的时候，再进一步对他们进行教育和改造的工作。人民手里有强大的国家机器，不怕民族资产阶级造反。
    严重的问题是教育农民。农民的经济是分散的，根据苏联的经验，需要很长的时间和细心的工作才能做到农业的社会化。没有农业的社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。而欲农业社会化，必须发展以国有企业为主体的强大的工业。人民民主专政的国家，必须有步骤地解决这个问题。本文不打算多谈经济问题，这里暂不详说。
    一九二四年，孙中山亲自指导的有共产党人参加的国民党第一次全国代表大会，通过了一个著名的宣言。这个宣言上说：“近世各国所谓民权制度，往往为资产阶级所专有，适成为压迫平民之工具。盖国民党之民权主义，则为一般平民所共有，非少数人所得而私也。”除了谁领导谁这一个问题以外，当作政治纲领一点来说，这里所说的民权主义，是和我们现在所实行的人民民主专政相符合的。
    蒋介石背叛孙中山，拿了官僚资产阶级和地主阶级的专政作为压迫中国平民的工具。这个反革命专政，实施了二十二年，到现在才为我们领导的中国平民所推翻。
    骂我们实行“独裁”或“极权主义”的外国反动派，就是实行独裁或极权主义的人们。他们实行了资产阶级对无产阶级及其他人民的一个阶级的独裁制度，一个阶级的极权主义。孙中山所说压迫平民的近世各国的资产阶级，正是指的这些人。蒋介石的反革命独裁，就是从这些反动家伙学来的。
    宋朝的哲学家朱熹，写了许多书，说了许多话，大家都忘记了，但有一句话还没有忘记：“即以其人之道，还治其人之身。”我们就是这样做的，即以帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动派之道，还治帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动派之身。如此而已，岂有他哉！
    革命的专政和反革命的专政，性质是相反的，而前者是从后者学来的。这个学习很要紧，革命的人民如果不学会这一项对待反革命的统治方法，他们就不能维持政权，他们的政权就会被内外反动派所推翻，内外反动派就会在中国复辟，革命的人民就会遭殃。
    人民民主专政的基础是工人阶级、农民阶级和城市小资产阶级的联盟，而主要是工人和农民的联盟，因为这两个阶级占了中国人口的百分之八十到九十。推翻帝国主义与国民党反动派，主要是这两个阶级的力量。由新民主主义到社会主义，主要依靠这两个阶级的联盟。
    人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。在帝国主义时代，任何国家的任何别的阶级，都不能领导任何真正的革命达到胜利。中国民族资产阶级曾经多次领导过革命，都失败了，就是明证。
    民族资产阶级在现阶段上，有其很大的重要性。我们还有帝国主义站在旁边，这个敌人是很凶恶的。中国在经济上要实现真正的独立，还需要经过很长的时间。只有中国的工业发展了，中国在经济上不倚赖外国了，才有真正的独立。中国的现代工业在整个国民经济的比重上是很小的。现在还没有可靠的数目字，根据某些材料来估计，现代工业不过只占全国国民经济总生产量的百分之十左右。为了对付帝国主义的压迫，为了使落后的经济地位提高一步，中国必须利用一切于国计民生有利而不是有害的城乡资本主义因素，团结民族资产阶级，共同奋斗。我们现在的方针是节制资本主义，而不是消灭资本主义。但是民族资产阶级不能充当革命的领导者，也不能在国家政权中占主要的地位。民族资产阶级之所以不能充当革命的领导者和所以不应当在国家政权机关中占主要地位，是因为民族资产阶级的社会经济地位规定了他们的软弱性，他们缺乏远见，缺乏足够的勇气，并且有不少的人害怕民众。
    孙中山主张“唤起民众”，或“扶助农工”。谁去“唤起”和“扶助”呢？孙中山的意思是说小资产阶级及民族资产阶级。但这在事实上是办不到的。孙中山的四十年革命是失败了，这是什么原因呢？在帝国主义时代，资产阶级不可能领导任何真正的革命到胜利，原因就在此。
    我们的二十八年，就大不相同。我们有许多宝贵的经验。一个有纪律的有马、恩、列、斯的理论武装的采取自我批评方法的联系人民群众的党。一个由这样的党领导的军队。一个由这样的党领导的各革命阶层各革命派别的统一战线。这三件是主要的经验。这些都是我们区别于前人的。依靠这三件，使我们取得了基本的胜利。我们走过了曲折的道路。我们曾和党内的机会主义倾向作斗争，右的和左的。凡在这三件事上犯了严重的错误的时候，革命就受挫折。错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，越迅速，越彻底，越好。
    总结我们的经验，集中到一点，就是工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政——这就是我们的公式，这就是我们的主要经验，这就是我们的主要纲领。
    党的二十八年是一个长时期，我们仅仅做了一件事，这就是取得了基本的胜利。这是值得庆祝的，因为这是人民的胜利，因为这是在中国这样一个大国的胜利。但是我们的事情还很多，譬如走路，过去的工作只不过象万里长征走完了第一步。残余的敌人尚待我们扫灭。严重的经济建设任务摆在我们面前。我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。这就是困难。帝国主义者算定我们办不好经济。他们站在一旁看，等待我们的失败。
    我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。不要摆官僚架子。钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。苏联共产党人开头也不大会办经济，帝国主义者也曾等待过他们的失败。但是联共是胜利了，在列宁和斯大林领导之下，他们不但会革命，也会建设。他们已经建设起来了一个伟大的光辉灿烂的社会主义国家。联共就是我们的最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习。我们完全可以依靠人民民主专政这个武器，团结全国除了反动派以外的一切人，稳步地走到目的地。
