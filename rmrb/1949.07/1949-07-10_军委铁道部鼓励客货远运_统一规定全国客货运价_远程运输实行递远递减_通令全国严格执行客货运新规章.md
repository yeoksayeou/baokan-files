Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, July 9th: To encourage long-distance passenger and freight transport, the Military Commission Railway Department has stipulated that unified national passenger and freight rates will be implemented from July 10th, and a decreasing rate system will be implemented for long-distance transport. Passenger fares are set as follows: third class is RMB 4 yuan per kilometer, second class soft seat is 8 yuan, and first class soft seat is 16 yuan. A decreasing rate will be applied starting from 200 kilometers, reducing by 42% at 2,000 kilometers, meaning only 58 yuan will be charged per 100 yuan. Freight is divided into 20 classes, with general luxury goods, valuables, and non-essential goods being classified into higher grades, while essential industrial and agricultural products, essential goods for people's livelihood, and important export goods have lower freight rates. For example, cosmetics, wool fabrics, gemstones, and sea cucumbers are classified as the first class, with a freight rate of 272 yuan and 73 fen per ton per kilometer (the same below). Silk fabrics, incense sticks, and bristles are classified as the second class, with a freight rate of 231 yuan and 82 fen. Cotton yarn and alcohol are classified as the eighth class, with a freight rate of 81 yuan and 82 fen. Cotton and raw silk are classified as the fourteenth class, with a freight rate of 24 yuan and 55 fen. Books are also classified as the fourteenth class. Wheat, firewood, cement, linen yarn, and iron products are classified as the fifteenth class, with a freight rate of 19 yuan and 09 fen. Rapeseed, peanut kernels, raw cotton, edible salt, ashes, and agricultural machinery are classified as the sixteenth class, with a freight rate of 13 yuan and 64 fen. Coarse grains, fertilizers, and ores are classified as the eighteenth class, with a freight rate of 5 yuan and 45 fen. Coal and pig iron ingots are classified as the nineteenth class, with a freight rate of only 2 yuan and 73 fen. Peat and dry animal manure are classified as the twentieth class, with a freight rate of only 1 yuan and 36 fen. A decreasing rate will be applied to freight starting from 100 kilometers, reducing by 42.6% at 2,000 kilometers, meaning only 57 yuan and 40 fen will be charged per 100 yuan. Goods not filling an entire car will be charged double the freight rate for less-than-carload shipments. To reward exports or particularly encourage the transport of certain goods, specific freight rates will be determined as needed. For example, the freight for cement is stipulated to be reduced by 50% of the standard price. There are also different reduction regulations for export goods. Parcel transport is divided into four levels. Ivory, gemstones, and gold and silver products are the first level, with a freight rate of 9 yuan and 09 fen per kilogram per 10 kilometers (the same below). Liquor, cotton, and bicycles are the second level, with a freight rate of 4 yuan and 55 fen. Salted fish, eggs, and fruits are the fourth level, with a freight rate of 1 yuan and 82 fen. Other items are classified into the third level, with a freight rate of 2 yuan and 57 fen. Special items have special pricing, such as movie films, which are reduced by 50% of the actual freight rate. To facilitate the supply of daily necessities to urban residents, fresh meat, fresh vegetables, and chicks will all be reduced by 30% of the fourth-level freight rate.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, July 9th: The freight rate schedule, commodity classification table, passenger rate schedule, passenger rate miscellaneous fee calculation rules, freight rate miscellaneous fee calculation rules, and current interim passenger and freight transport rules formulated by the Freight Rate Conference of the Railway Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, have been submitted to the People's Revolutionary Military Commission for approval. From July 10th, they will be implemented uniformly in the Northern Railway, the Southern Railway (excluding the Handan Management Office under the Zhengzhou Bureau), and the Northeastern Railway (the freight rate schedule and commodity classification table will not be implemented in the Northeast for the time being). All previous freight rates, miscellaneous fees, rules, and supplements implemented by various bureaus that conflict with these regulations will be abolished. The Railway Department has issued a circular to all bureaus to strictly enforce them. The circular pointed out that the formulation of these passenger and freight rates and rules has great significance in promoting the exchange of goods throughout the country, developing production, prospering the economy, and bringing national railway passenger and freight operations onto a unified path. The circular also pointed out that all railway bureaus should pay close attention to the following three points when implementing the above regulations:

　　(1) The newly formulated freight rates and rules should be implemented immediately after promulgation. All bureaus should grasp the time, make rapid arrangements, mobilize business personnel to organize closely, and assign responsible cadres at all levels to personally supervise and inspect the site during implementation to ensure the smooth completion of this innovative task.

　　(2) The freight rates and rules formulated this time are general in nature, especially the commodity classification, which may not be entirely suitable for individual regions and individual railways. All management bureaus should listen to feedback at any time, study it, and promptly submit specific opinions to the Railway Department so that regional special prices or supplements can be formulated, or other improvements can be made.

　　(3) The freight rates and miscellaneous fees this time are based on the price index of various places in May of this year. In the future, any increase or decrease in freight rates and miscellaneous fees will be based on these regulations. To accurately grasp the calculation, all bureaus should report to the Railway Department on time in accordance with the previously promulgated methods.

　　In addition: The Railway Department has established three inspection teams in Shanghai, Jinan, Hankou, Zhengzhou, and Taiyuan, Pingjin, which departed to various places on the 8th to inspect the implementation of the above new regulations.
