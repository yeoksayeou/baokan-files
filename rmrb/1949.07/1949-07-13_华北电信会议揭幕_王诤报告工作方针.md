　　The North China Telecom Conference Opens
  　Wang Zheng Reports on Work Guidelines
    [Our Newspaper] The North China Telecom Conference, jointly convened by the North China Bureau, the North China People's Government, and the North China Military Region, and presided over by the Telecommunications General Bureau of the Central Military Commission, opened at 10:00 AM on the 12th in the auditorium of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau. In the morning, Liu Yin, Deputy Director of the Telecommunications General Bureau, reported that the main purpose of the conference was to resolve six major issues: (1) the establishment of command bureaus in the North China region and the division of their jurisdictions; (2) the construction and management of local telecommunications and the relationship between local military and government telecommunications organs; (3) the organization and reorganization plans of the command bureaus; (4) the review and approval of the construction plans and operating budgets of the command bureaus; (5) the adoption of unified telecommunications regulations for North China; and (6) the determination of salary standards and telegram and telephone rates for telecommunications bureaus that have already implemented enterprise management.
    At 2:00 PM, Comrade Wang Zheng, Director of the Telecommunications General Bureau, gave a report on work guidelines. In addition to pointing out the importance of building North China's telecommunications, he pointed out that a lot of experience had been accumulated in operating telecommunications in rural areas in the past, which should be absorbed, but not mechanically applied. Special attention should be paid to the working experience of new urban equipment. He said that good systems of the past should be retained and strengthened, and unsuitable systems should be removed, and new systems and regulations should be re-established. In addition to providing many specific opinions on the issues to be resolved at this conference, Comrade Wang Zheng also explained who state-owned telecommunications enterprises should serve and the scope of future business. He pointed out that the service targets should be: 1. To serve the government's upper and lower levels of communication; 2. To serve state-owned, public, and private enterprises; 3. To serve the news media; 4. To serve residents, and when necessary, to handle military telegrams to serve the military. The conference also invited Meng Guimin, Director of the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, Jiang Wen, Director of the Communications Department of the Northeast Military Region, and He Ziming, Director of the Jinzhou Postal and Telecommunications Administration, to attend and introduce Northeast experience. At the same time, five groups were formed, namely, business, engineering and equipment, military region and local communication, finance, and cadre personnel, to study and discuss relevant issues separately.
