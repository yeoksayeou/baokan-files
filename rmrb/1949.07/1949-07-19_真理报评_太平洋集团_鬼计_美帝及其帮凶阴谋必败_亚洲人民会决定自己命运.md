Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: TASS, Moscow: *Pravda* published a prominent international commentary on the 17th, discussing the frequent activities of planning the Pacific Group. The commentator pointed out that when Chiang Kai-shek met with Philippine President Quirino, they announced that they were establishing a "holy alliance" against communism. The commentator stated that Chiang Kai-shek and Quirino were not secretly conferring alone. According to news dispatches, Philippine generals, and most importantly, representatives of MacArthur, were also present. The commentator stated that this indicates who is the instigator and prompter of the new version of the Pacific Group. The commentator pointed out that although Chiang Kai-shek and Quirino posed as "main protagonists," the presence of MacArthur's special representative at the Philippine meeting clearly indicated what the proposed Pacific Group intends to use as its foundation. The main role in it is naturally assigned to Japan, which is under American protection. The commentator concluded: American imperialism and its accomplices can consult at various conference tables at will, but the people of Asian and Pacific countries will decide their own destiny. This adventurous plan to form a Pacific Group is doomed to fail.

    真理报评“太平洋集团”鬼计
    美帝及其帮凶阴谋必败
    亚洲人民会决定自己命运
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于十七日以显著地位刊载的国际评述中，曾论及策划太平洋集团的频繁活动。评论员指出，当蒋介石与菲律宾总统季里诺会晤时，他们宣布是在建立反共“神圣同盟”。评论员称，蒋介石与季里诺并不是暗中单独会商的。据新闻电讯称，菲律宾的将领，而且最重要的，连麦克阿瑟的代表都出席了。评论员称，这指明谁是太平洋集团新版的鼓动者和授意人。评论员指明，虽然蒋介石与季里诺冒充“主要主人公”，但事实上，麦克阿瑟特别代表的出席菲律宾会议，却清晰指明拟议中的太平洋集团打算用什么作基础。其中的主要角色，自然而然地分派给美国庇护下的日本。评论员结语称：美帝国主义及其帮凶可以随意在各种会议桌上磋商，但是，亚洲各国和太平洋各国的人民，会自己决定他们的命运。这种成立太平洋集团的冒险计划，是注定要失败的。
