　　Remembering Mr. Tao Xingzhi – On the Third Anniversary of His Death
　　Cao Jianpei
　　I met Mr. Tao in the autumn of 1928. At that time, I went to Xiaozhuang from my hometown to study, and that was when I began to know him. At that time, his name was not Tao Xingzhi, but Tao Zhixing. Xiaozhuang School was only run for three and a half years before it was closed down by the people's enemy, Chiang Kai-shek.

　　After Xiaozhuang School was closed, Mr. Tao was wanted. He fled to Japan in 1930. Soon after, he secretly went from Japan to Shanghai. Because the wanted order had not been canceled, he secretly raised donations to establish the Natural Garden and the Children's Science Correspondence School, engaging in the "Movement to Bring Natural Science Down to the Masses," introducing natural science to children and the general public.

　　After the "January 28th Incident," Mr. Tao founded the Shanhai Industrial and Educational Group in Mengjia Muqiao near Dachang, between Baoshan and Shanghai counties, advocating "work to sustain life, learning to understand life, and unity to protect life." Regarding his educational career and educational ideas, from the Xiaozhuang Movement to the Shanhai Industrial and Educational Group, from Yucai School to the Social University, there have been many narratives of his theory and practice. I don't need to mention much here. I would like to briefly talk about what his educational career did for the people.

　　(1) Raising Funds for Water Pumps to Save Farmers from Drought
　　In the summer of about 1933, the Dachang area of Baoshan County was very dry. The residents near the Shanhai Industrial and Educational Group were panicked and lived in fear. Farmers ran around crying out, unable to think of a way to make it rain. Some superstitious people had to turn to the gods—relying on the Great Sage Bodhisattva to pray for rain. Seeing such a drought, Mr. Tao saw that farmers in every household were sighing and weeping with anxiety. He thought: if it is so dry and we still sit in school as usual, waiting for students to come to class, the school will have to close. So he ran around to raise donations, running around for several days, and finally raised several thousand yuan from his friends to purchase and rent three or four water pumps. He organized the teachers and students of the Shanhai Industrial and Educational Group and nearby residents, regardless of age or gender, into the "Drought Relief Industrial and Educational Group." Then, they used water pumps to pump water from the Liehe River to Dachang, irrigating the fields in this area, and using this opportunity to explain to the farmers the reasons why it was not raining, in order to break the farmers' superstitious ideas. Subsequently, the farmers' rice seedlings, bean seedlings, vegetable seedlings, and cotton seedlings all turned from yellow to green, growing vigorously. The farmers saw that their crops were saved and happily pointed to the water pumps, saying, "You are truly a living bodhisattva!"

　　(2) Organizing Cotton Industrial and Educational Group to Improve Cotton Products
　　Foreign imperialists had been buying cotton in the Shanghai area at high prices for years, but suddenly one year they stopped buying. Farmers planted a lot of cotton, but suddenly could not sell it. They could not get money to buy food and felt panicked.

　　Cotton production accounted for more than 70% of the agricultural products near the Shanhai Industrial and Educational Group. Mr. Tao then organized the farmers in this area to establish the "Cotton Industrial and Educational Group." He helped farmers find ways to improve cotton varieties, so that they could be harvested in large quantities with pure and beautiful quality, sold at high prices, and also publicized the principles of foreign imperialist aggression to farmers. With this organization, cotton would not suffer from excessively low prices, and at the same time, they also understood some principles of imperialist aggression.

　　(3) Showing Literacy Movies to Farmers
　　Although Mengjia Muqiao was only twenty or thirty miles away from Shanghai, farmers near Dachang had rarely or almost never seen movies. He thought about how to let farmers also see movies. He first selected some teachers and students to learn how to operate the generator, then bought a projector, and then rented movies related to production from Shanghai film studios to show in the countryside. Before the screening, he also did one thing, which was to revise the film instructions, making them short, about a hundred words or so, so that farmers who were barely literate could understand them. In addition, he also printed admission tickets with very popular explanations. After these procedures were in place, he then mobilized the young teachers to publicize to the common people, explaining that the Industrial and Educational Group would be showing a movie on a certain day. The movie was free, but there was only one condition, that the farmer who knew the words on the admission ticket could go in to see the movie.

　　On the day the movie was shown, the front door of the movie theater was filled with young teachers, who collected tickets and maintained order in the theater. When farmers still did not recognize the words on the admission tickets and instructions, the young teachers used this opportunity to carry out literacy education. The farmers watched movies without spending money, and also learned to read, which was truly joyous.

　　(4) Running a Workers' Kindergarten
　　After the autumn of 1933, Mr. Tao's educational interest, or rather, Mr. Tao's educational direction, turned to the workers. He realized that it was wrong to only popularize farmer education and not worker education; so he used to write a Hoe Song, and at this time, he added: "It's useless to rely on the hoe alone, unite with machines to make revolution!" During this time, he devoted a lot of energy to opening a workers' kindergarten near the Large Self-Ringing Bell on Rue Robert in Shanghai. From this time on, the workers in the Rue Robert area had a place to entrust their children while they went to work, reducing the burden. This kindergarten was run for about two years, and finally closed down due to: (1) financial difficulties, and (2) the oppression of the reactionary government.

　　(5) Running Workers' Night Schools
　　During this period, Mr. Tao devoted almost most of his time to popularizing worker education. Many factories in Shanghai, especially the factories in the Yangshupu area, had workers' night schools. The school sites of the primary schools in the Yangshupu area were all turned into our workers' night school sites at night. He compiled a set of worker literacy readers called "Old and Young Can Understand." Everyone attending the worker literacy classes could get a free copy.

　　Okay, there are many of Tao's educational undertakings, and I have only described a few examples above.

　　Today is July 25th, the third anniversary of Mr. Tao's death. On this commemorative day, how should we, the comrades of the Living Education Society, commemorate Mr. Tao?! I think:

　　First, Mr. Tao's education is connected to the masses, combined with reality, and serves the masses. In the past, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, his Living Education could not be smoothly promoted. In today's liberated areas, Mr. Tao's ideal educational undertaking can be universally realized. Because Mr. Tao's education is in line with the New Democratic education policy. Therefore, when we commemorate Mr. Tao this year, I feel that our comrades of the Living Education Society should strengthen the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism and move forward with the times. At the same time, we must strengthen loyalty and unity, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise and great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, strive for the popularization of New Democratic education! Fight!

　　Second, learn from Mr. Tao's creativity in the field of education. Mr. Tao's educational methods are constantly changing, constantly developing, and progressing. When we commemorate the third anniversary of Mr. Tao's death this year, we must learn and promote his creativity to accelerate the popularization and improvement of New Democratic education.

　　回忆陶行知先生--逝世三周年纪念
    曹建培
    我认识陶先生是在一九二八年的秋天，因为那时，我是从家乡到晓庄去求学，才开始认识他的。那时他的名字不是叫陶行知，而是叫做陶知行。晓庄学校一共只办了三年半的时间，以后就被人民的公敌蒋介石把他封闭了。
    晓庄学校封闭后，陶先生被通缉，他于一九三○年亡命日本。不久又秘密从日本到上海，因为通缉令尚未取消，他就暗地里募捐，筹办自然学园，又办儿童科学通讯学校，从事“自然科学下嫁运动”，把自然科学介绍给儿童，把自然科学介绍给人民大众。
    “一二八”后，陶先生创办山海工学团于上海宝山两县之间大场附近的孟家木桥，主张“工以养生，学以明生，团以保生”。关于他的教育事业和教育主张，从晓庄运动到山海工学团，从育才学校到社会大学，它的理论和实际，都已有很多的叙述，在这里，我无需多提。我想在这里略略说一说，他的教育事业，到底为人民办了一些什么事情。
    （一）筹募抽水机，为农民救旱
    约摸在一九三三年的夏天，宝山县大场一带，天旱得很，山海工学团附近一带的居民，人心惶惶，不可终日，农友们奔走呼号，想不出一点方法来使天下雨，一些迷信的人们，只好求之神--靠大圣菩萨来求雨。陶先生看到这样的天旱，家家户户的农民，都急得叹息流泪。心里就想：天这样的旱，如果还象往常一样，坐在学校里，等着学生来上学，这个学校就要关门了。于是他东奔西走，劝募捐款，前后奔走了好几天，好容易从他的几位朋友中，募了几千元的款子，购买和租借了三、四部抽水机，他把山海工学团的师生和附近的居民，不分老幼男女，都组织在“救旱工学团”里，于是就用抽水机把通到大场洌河一带的河水吸起，灌溉这一带的田地，并利用这个时机向农民解释天不下雨的道理，以破除农民迷信观念。随后农民的谷苗、豆苗、菜苗、棉苗，统统从黄变青，蓬蓬勃勃的生长起来。农民看到了自己的禾苗得救了，就喜的指着那几部抽水机说：“你这真是活菩萨！”
    （二）组织棉花工学团改进棉花产品
    外国帝国主义者，连年都是用高价在上海附近一带收买棉花，突然有一年不收买了，农民种了许多棉花，忽然卖不出去。得不到钱买粮食，感到恐慌。
    山海工学团附近的农产品，棉花出产占百分之七十以上。陶先生又把这一带农民组织起来，成立“棉花工学团”。帮助农民设法，改进棉花品种，使之收获量多而质纯美，可以获高价出售，并向农民宣传外国帝国主义者侵略的道理，农民有此组织，棉花才不会遭到过低的价格，同时，也懂了点帝国主义侵略的道理。
    （三）给农民看识字电影
    孟家木桥距离上海虽然只有二、三十里路，在大场附近的农民，还是很少或者几乎没有看到过电影，他心里想着，怎样给农民也看一看电影。他首先挑选了一些先生和学生，学会了开动发电机，然后买了一部放映机，再在上海影片场租借有关生产的电影片，拿到乡下去放映。在放映之前，还做一项工作，就是把电影说明书，从新改过，把它改得短短的，约百字左右，使得粗识几个字的农民都能看得懂。另外还印发一种入场券，上面有很通俗的说明，这些手续具备之后，接着就动员小先生去宣传老百姓，说明工学团某一天将要放映电影。这个电影不卖票，但只要一个条件，就是要识得入场券上字的农民就可进去看电影。
    电影开放的那天，电影场的前门，站满了小先生，由他们收票，维持影场秩序，凡农民对入场券和就明书还有不认识的字，小先生就利用这个机会，进行识字教育。农民看了不化钱的电影。又识了字，真是喜气洋洋。
    （四）办工人幼儿团
    一九三三年的秋后，陶先生教育的兴趣，也可以说，陶先生教育的方向，转到工人方面来了，他意识到，仅只普及农民教育，而不普及工人教育，这是不对的；所以他从前写了一首锄头歌，这时，又把它加了：“光靠锄头不中用呀，联合机器来革命呀！”一句，他在这时，化了很大的精力，在上海劳勃生路大自鸣钟附近，开办了一个工人幼儿团，从这时起，劳勃生路一带的工人，有了一个寄托孩子而去做工的地方，减少了累赘。这个幼儿团办了约有二年之久，终因：（一）经济困难，（二）反动政府的压迫而停办了。
    （五）办工人夜校
    陶先生在这个时期，差不多把大部分的时间，都放在普及工人教育方面。上海许多工厂，特别是杨树浦一带的工厂的工人，都有了工人夜校，杨树浦一带的小学校的校址，夜间都变成了我们的工人夜校的校址了。他编了一套工人识字读本叫“老少通”。凡上工人夜校识字班的人，都可以免费人手一册。
    好了，陶氏的教育事业很多，我上面不过说明几个例子而已。
    今天是七月二十五日，是陶先生逝世三周年纪念的节日，当此纪念的节日的时候，我们生活教育社的同志们，应该怎样纪念陶先生呢？！我认为：
    第一、陶先生的教育是联系群众的，是结合实际的，是为群众服务的，在以前国民党反动统治时代，他的生活教育是不得顺利推行的。在今天解放区，陶先生理想的教育事业，是可以普遍的实现了。因为陶先生的教育是适合新民主主义教育方针的。因此，当我们今年纪念陶先生的时候，我觉得我们生活教育社的同志们，应该加强马列主义的理论学习，跟着时代前进。同时，要加强忠诚团结，在中国共产党领导下，在中国人民英明伟大领袖毛主席领导下，为普及新民主主义教育努力！奋斗！
    第二、学习陶先生在教育事业上的创造性。陶先生的教育方法，是时时在变化的，时时在发展和进步的。当我们今年纪念陶先生逝世三周年纪念的时候，我们要学习并发扬他的创造性，为加快普及和提高新民主主义的教育而服务。
