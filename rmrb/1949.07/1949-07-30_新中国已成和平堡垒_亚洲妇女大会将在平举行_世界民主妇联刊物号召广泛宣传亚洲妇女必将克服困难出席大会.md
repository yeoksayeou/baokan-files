Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 29th. The World Federation of Democratic Women's "News Report" published news of the Asian Women's Conference being held in Beiping.

The publication pointed out: "The Chinese Women's Federation's invitation to hold this conference on Chinese territory has new significance. China is emerging from thousands of years of feudalism and oppression. The glorious victory of the New China proves that gold, dollars, airplanes, and tanks cannot do anything to the people who are determined to live freely. Those women who have stepped forward to protect their children from the threat of new and brutal wars are treating the victorious Chinese women with gratitude; they have made their motherland a fortress of peace, rather than an aggression base that the imperialist war-makers hoped for."

The publication called on all branches of the World Federation of Women to vigorously publicize the significance of the conference in all parts of the world, and is convinced that women from Asian countries will overcome difficulties by all means to attend the conference. Regarding imperialist countries, the publication said: "We emphasize that the participation of women from France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Britain, the United States and other countries in the conference should oppose military intervention and the colonial wars being waged by their governments in practical ways and concrete activities. Representatives from these countries will report on these activities at the conference."

It is reported that women in Vietnam and other countries are enthusiastically preparing to participate in the conference. The Vietnamese Women's Federation stated in a letter to the World Federation of Democratic Women that their preparatory work "is just like they once participated in the preparations for the Vietnamese General Counter-Offensive with full enthusiasm."

The Czechoslovak Women's Federation will organize an "International Day of Solidarity with Asian Women" this summer to let all Czech women know the importance of uniting with Asian women who are fighting for freedom. Donations will be collected during the International Day to support the women representatives attending the Asian Women's Conference.

　　新中国已成和平堡垒
  　亚洲妇女大会将在平举行
    世界民主妇联刊物号召广泛宣传亚洲妇女必将克服困难出席大会
    【新华社布拉格二十九日电】世界民主妇联“消息汇报”登载亚洲妇女大会将在北平举行的消息。
    该刊指出：“中国妇联之邀请该会在中国国土上举行这个大会，具有新的意义。中国正从数千年的封建和压迫中脱颖而出。新中国的光辉胜利，证明了金元和飞机坦克对于决心要自由生活的人民都起不了任何作用。那些挺身而起以保护她们的子女免受新的残酷战争威胁的妇女们，以感谢的心情来对待胜利的中国妇女们，她们已使其祖国成为和平的堡垒，而非帝国主义战争制造者所希望的侵略基地。”
    该刊号召世界妇联各支部在世界各处竭力宣传该会的意义，并深信亚洲各国妇女将用一切方法克服困难，出席大会。对于帝国主义国家，该刊说：“我们强调法、荷、比、英、美等国妇女们的参加大会，应以实际方式和具体活动来反对军事干涉，反对他们政府正在进行的殖民地战争。这些国家的代表们将在大会上报告这些活动。”
    据悉，越南等国妇女正热烈进行参加大会的筹备工作。越南妇联会在给世界民主妇联的信里，表示她们的筹备工作“正如她们曾经怀着满腔热情参加越南大反攻的准备工作一样”。
    捷克斯洛伐克的妇联会将在今夏组织一个“和亚洲妇女团结的国际日”，以便使全捷妇女们知道与正在为自由而奋斗的亚洲妇女们团结的重要性。国际日中将进行募捐，以资助参加亚洲妇女大会的妇女代表们。
