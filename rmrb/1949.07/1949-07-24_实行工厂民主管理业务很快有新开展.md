The Northern China Transportation Company's Automotive Department also pointed out in its report that they had not adequately educated the workers, leading to disunity between new and old workers. Administratively, they had not listened to the workers' opinions, which hindered the department's work. However, after administrative self-criticism and active mobilization of the workers to engage in criticism and discussion, the establishment of a trade union and a factory management committee, and reliance on the workers in business, new developments emerged in May. The automobiles traveled 27,700 kilometers, saving 330 gallons of gasoline. In June, the mileage increased to 40,300 kilometers, saving 477 gallons of gasoline. This increased the company's revenue and improved business. In June, the company felt a shortage of gasoline and that gasoline vehicles were too costly, so it decided to convert to charcoal-fueled vehicles. Initially, the leadership felt incapable of carrying out the conversion, but the workers were willing to accept the task. After two experiments, overcoming the difficulty of tools, they successfully completed the conversion. Nine workers spent nine days completing the first charcoal stove, costing over 80,000 yuan in labor and materials, saving 50,000 yuan compared to outsourcing to private merchants and 30,000 yuan compared to having the Beigouyan Repair Shop do it. This not only reduced costs but also met the urgent needs of the business. They mobilized and organized drivers to help mechanics repair vehicles, increasing the number of serviceable vehicles from 17 or 18 out of 55 in April to 43 or 44 in the second half of June. This reliance on the workers created brilliant achievements.

The Tianjin Transportation Company, after explaining their business losses, pointed out that the reasons, besides the lack of a strict economic accounting system and problems in business development and management, were mainly the failure to adequately educate and mobilize the workers. The workers' awareness had not been raised, and some workers were lax in production. Some individuals were late six times in a month. In the company's maintenance yard, there were 56 instances of lateness and 16.5 days of absenteeism in February, March, April, and May. This laxity hindered business progress. By June, the leadership paid attention to this, and work improved daily. They used old materials to convert seven charcoal stoves. The number of broken-down vehicles decreased, guaranteeing the number of vehicles in operation (increased from the original 40 to 43). Mileage also reached over 90,000 kilometers, and business income increased compared to before. (Trace)

　　实行工厂民主管理业务很快有新开展
    北平运输公司汽车部在报告中也指出他们原先没有很好的教育工人群众，新旧工人之间存在着不团结的现象，行政上没有很好的听取工人意见，因此汽车部工作不能展开。但经过行政上的自我检讨，积极发动工人群众，展开批评讨论，成立工会与工厂管理委员会，在业务上依靠工人群众，在五月份就有了新的开展，汽车行驶了二万七千七百公里，节省汽油三百三十加仑；到了六月份，行驶里程增到四万零三百公里，节省汽油达四百七十七加仑。增加了公司的收入，营业得以上升。六月份，公司方面感到汽油缺乏，汽油车花费成本过高，乃有改装木炭车之决定。当时领导上以为自己无力改装，但工人们愿意接受该项任务，他们经过两次的试验，克服了工具的困难，果然改造成功。九个工人花了九天功夫，完成了第一部木炭炉，费工料共计八万多元，较比给私商包办省了五万元，比北沟沿修理厂代制省三万元。这不但减低了成本，而且满足了业务上迫切的需要。他们发动组织司机，帮助技工修理车辆，从四月份五十五部车辆保持十七八辆能行驶的车子，到六月份下半月竟增高保持能行驶的车辆达四十三四部。这样依靠工人群众，才创造了辉煌的成绩。
    天津运输公司在说明了他们营业亏本的情形之后，指出其中的原因，除了严格的经济核算制没有建立，业务开展和管理上存在着问题之外，主要是没有很好的教育发动工人群众，工人的自觉性没能提高，有些工人在生产上表现松懈，个别工人在一个月中竟迟到六次，该公司的保养场在二、三、四、五四个月中，迟到的有五十六次，旷工的有十六天半。这种松懈现象，防碍业务进展。到了六月份，领导上注意及此，工作日见进步。他们利用旧料，改造个炭炉达七部；坏车减少，保证行驶车辆（原定四十部，增至四十三部）；跑车亦达九万多公里，营业收入较比以前都增多了。（迹）
