Title: Work Reports Do Not Match Reality; Work in Tanglou Village Exists in Name Only; Leading Cadres of Shan-Yu County Do Not Go Deep Enough and Should Conduct Self-Criticism and Rectification

[JiluYu Telegram] The Shan-Yu County Party Committee of the Lake West District considers the production of Tanglou Village (a key village of the county party committee) in Shan-Yu County to be among the best in the county. In their report to the district party committee in May, they cited this village as a good example. When the district party committee, in order to cautiously gain experience, went to the village to investigate and understand the situation, Comrade Zhang Deren, the secretary of the district committee, happily introduced the village, saying: the seven mutual aid teams in the village have organized the twenty-eight families without livestock into the mutual aid teams, and the remaining thirty-two families have expanded on the original basis, so there is no wasteland. Five women have been organized to participate in agricultural production, and many manure pits and pigsties have been renovated, and some new toilets have been added... It seems that there is no problem with the village's increased production task this year. After the comrades who were inspecting the work of the district party committee understood the situation among the masses, what was the actual situation? 1. There were only four ox-sharing teams in the village, and those without livestock still did not participate in mutual aid. There was no analysis or research into whether there were any problems within these four groups or how to improve them. 2. Some pigsties were indeed renovated. However, the pigs still run around outside the pigsties as before, and there is no accumulation of manure in the sties; the number of toilets has indeed increased compared to the past, but who would go to the toilets in this village where every family has a toilet and there are very few passers-by? 3. A lot of effort has been put into mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production, including holding meetings, individual mobilization, etc. But due to the past plundering by the Jiang bandits and the poor harvests of grain, eight out of ten families in the village had no food this spring, and the masses urgently demanded how to get through the spring famine and how to sell the woven cloth to the south of the railway to earn more money. We did not start from the situation of the masses, improve the quality of the local cloth, and try to promote sales, and organize women to participate in agricultural production when it was necessary and possible. Instead, we went everywhere saying "weaving has no future" without considering the actual situation, needs, and possibilities; and forced women to go to the fields to hoe wheat; and very formally let the masses add more toilets, renovate pigsties, and hold meetings. But it is difficult to say what effect this had on production. 4. Although timely sowing in the spring ploughing was achieved, it violated the principle of voluntarism and mutual benefit because of the lack of equivalent exchange, causing dissatisfaction among the middle peasants. It is not difficult to see from here that the local county and district leadership is quite bureaucratic in its leadership of this village. Why does this phenomenon occur? 1. There is a lack of specific and detailed implementation at each level when deploying work. The district party committee deploys to the county, the county deploys to the district in the same way, and the district deploys to the village in the same way. The purpose of the work was also not clearly explained: why should we organize production, how should we lead; so that the cadres can only understand in empty principles and theories, but cannot understand according to the actual situation: what are the benefits of organizing mutual aid for the vital interests of the masses in the village, what kind of mutual aid do the masses need, how to organize it, etc., and they still have not been able to solve it well in their minds. Therefore, there is great blindness in production leadership. 2. After the work is deployed, what follows is reporting and numerical figures. Little is done in conducting concrete and in-depth investigation and research, helping to summarize experience, and promptly telling cadres how to work, what is done right, and what is done wrong, so as to gradually cultivate and improve the leadership ability of cadres (at present, there are few and weak cadres, and concrete guidance and help from the leadership is especially needed). Therefore, after the district held a meeting of village cadres, the work team went to the village to ask for figures. How did the village deal with this work? Some villages still take statistics, and some villages report casually. As the village branch secretary of Chenhai Village in Caihai District said: "When investigating, just say how many manure pits we dug." If such statistical materials are put together as comprehensive materials to explain the problem and guide the work, it is very dangerous.

### 工作报告与实际不符  汤楼村工作徒具空名  单虞县区领导不深入应检查纠正

    工作报告与实际不符
    汤楼村工作徒具空名
    单虞县区领导不深入应检查纠正
    【冀鲁豫电】湖西分区单虞县汤楼村（县委重点村）的生产，单虞县委认为是在全县中较好的村子。他们在五月份向地委的报告上，曾以该村作为较好的例子举了出来。当地委为了慎重取得经验，深入该村调查了解情况的时候，该区分委书记张德仁同志满意的向大家介绍：该村七个互助组，已把无牲口的二十八家组织到互助组里，下余三十二家又在原有的基础上扩大了进去，因此无荒地。组织了五个妇女参加农业生产，改造了不少粪坑、猪圈，增添了一些新厕所……。似乎这个村子今年的增产任务没有什么问题了。经过地委检查工作的同志在群众中了解，实际情况如何呢？一、村里原只有四个＠犋组，没有牲口的依然没参加互助，而这四个组内部有没问题，如何提高，也没有分析研究；二、猪圈是改造了一些。但是，猪仍和过去一样，在猪圈外跑着，圈里没有积粪；厕所的确比过去增加了，但这个每家都有厕所，又很少来往行人的村庄，谁往里面拉呢？三、发动妇女参加农业生产，在该村工作的同志确实是费了很大力气，开会，个别动员，……但该村由于过去蒋匪的抢掠和粮食的歉收，今春十有八家没有饭吃，群众迫切要求的是如何渡过春荒，如何把织的布卖到铁路南去，赚的钱更多一些。我们没有从群众这种情况出发，提高土布的质量，设法推广销路，在必需与可能情况下，组织妇女参加农业生产，而不据实际情况、需要与可能，反到处讲：“纺织没有前途了”；硬去动员妇女下地锄麦；非常形式主义地让群众多加厕所，改造猪圈，开会。但究竟对生产起到了什么作用，就很难讲了。四、春耕及时下种虽做到了，但因没有等价，违犯了自愿两利的原则，造成了中农不满。从这里不难看出，当地县区在对于这个村子的领导上官僚主义是相当严重的。为什么发生这种现象呢？一、在布置工作时缺乏逐级的具体化，地委布置到县，县照样布置到区，区照样布置到村。关于工作的目的性，亦未明确的讲解：为什么要组织起来生产，如何领导；使干部只能空洞的在原则理论上了解，而不能根据实际情况领会：组织互助对村里群众的切身利益有什么好处，群众需要怎样的互助，如何去组织等等，则仍在思想上没能很好的解决。因之，在生产领导上有很大的盲目性。二、工作布置下去之后，紧接着是要报告，要数目字，对具体深入的调查研究，帮助总结经验，及时告诉干部如何工作，哪些作的对，哪些作的不对，逐渐培养和提高干部的领导能力，却作的少（目前干部少而弱，领导上具体的指导和帮助尤其需要）。因之，区里开过村干会之后，工作组便到村里问数字，村里如何应付这一工作呢？有的村还统计，有的村随便报，如蔡海区陈海村的村支书说：“调查时就说咱挖了多少粪坑。”如果把这样的统计材料弄到一块当作全面的材料来说明问题，指导工作，那是很危险的。
