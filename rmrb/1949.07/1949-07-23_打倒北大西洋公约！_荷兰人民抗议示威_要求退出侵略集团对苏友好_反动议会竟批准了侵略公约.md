Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: Reports from various sources: When the Dutch Parliament began discussing the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty on July 15th, the working people of the Netherlands launched a protest movement against its ratification. The Dutch Committee for the Defense of Peace wrote to members of Parliament, stating that the North Atlantic Treaty violates the United Nations Charter, which the Netherlands had signed. This treaty is a threat to peace. It brings new disasters to millions of people. The Committee for the Defense of Peace called on all members of Parliament to vote against the treaty. The working people of Rotterdam held a mass protest demonstration on the 17th. Large numbers of male and female workers marched on the streets, carrying flags inscribed with slogans such as "Down with the North Atlantic Treaty!" and "We need peace!" Several thousand working people of Amsterdam held a grand rally on the 18th under the slogans of "Down with the North Atlantic Treaty! Friendship with the Soviet Union! Long live peace!" Dutch Member of Parliament Hotezak addressed the meeting. When he called on the Dutch government to withdraw from the North Atlantic bloc, stop war preparations, and establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, the attendees responded with thunderous applause. Within the parliament, Dutch Communist Party members and other progressive members of parliament also struggled to demand the rejection of the treaty. However, despite the fierce opposition from the people and progressive members of parliament, the Dutch Parliament, dominated by reactionaries, actually approved the North Atlantic Treaty on July 19th by a vote of 67 to 7.

    【新华社北平二十二日电】各方报道：当荷兰议会自七月十五日起讨论批准北大西洋公约时候，荷兰劳动人民发动了反对批准该公约的抗议运动。荷兰拥护和平委员会致书国会议员称：北大西洋公约违反了荷兰曾签字的联合国宪章。这一公约是对和平的威胁。它为千百万人民带来新的祸难。拥护和平委员会要求全体国会议员投票反对该公约。鹿特丹劳动人民于十七日举行了群众性的抗议示威。大队男女工人手执书写“打倒北大西洋公约！”“我们需要和平！”等标语的旗帜，在各马路上游行。阿姆斯特丹数千劳动人民于十八日在“打倒北大西洋公约！对苏联友好！和平万岁”的口号下，举行盛大集会。荷兰国会议员霍特萨克向大会发表演说。当他要求荷政府退出北大西洋集团、停止战争准备及与苏联、人民民主国家建立友好关系时，与会者报以雷动的掌声。在议会以内，荷共议员与其他进步议员也为要求否决该公约而进行了斗争。但是，不顾人民与进步议员的猛烈反对，以反动派占多数的荷兰议会，竟于七月十九日以六十七票对七票批准了北大西洋公约。
