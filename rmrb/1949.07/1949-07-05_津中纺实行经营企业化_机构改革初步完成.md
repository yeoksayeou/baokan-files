　　Tianjin China Textile Implements Enterprise-Oriented Management
  　Institutional Reform Initially Completed
    [This Newspaper Tianjin Electric] The institutional reform of the China Textile Company has been initially completed. This is an important step in transforming the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital institution into a people's enterprise institution. This work began in April after Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report. At that time, the company leadership used the principle of enterprise-oriented management to study the company's organization. Based on the spirit of not disrupting the original enterprise institutions, it adjusted the unreasonable parts according to the actual situation and actual needs. In terms of personnel, it was decided that, except for those who committed heinous crimes and were washed away, the personnel of each section would be retained according to actual needs, work ability, and political conditions. After the heads of each section deliberated and discussed this decision, they put forward specific reorganization opinions. After the employee representatives' meeting studied and revised them, the Provisional Management Committee formally discussed and finally decided to implement them. Currently, the company has a total of 160 employees (the Materials Section is not yet included in the calculation). The surplus personnel, except for some who went to the Trade Corporation to help collect cotton and some who entered the raw cotton training class to learn technology, individual personnel were introduced to work in the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Railways, and most were sent to political training classes for study. After the study, the government will assign work. During the study period, in addition to the government providing for their living expenses, their family living expenses will be appropriately subsidized. Those who voluntarily seek other jobs will be given two months' salary.

　　津中纺实行经营企业化
  　机构改革初步完成
    【本报天津电】中纺公司机构改革初步完成。这是变国民党官僚资本机构为人民企业机构的重要步骤。这一工作开始于四月间刘少奇同志报告后，当时该公司领导上即以经营企业化的原则研究公司组织，并以不打乱原有企业机构的精神，根据实际情况和实际需要将不合理的部分加以调整。在人事上决定除罪大恶极者予以洗刷外，每课人员根据实际需要、工作能力以及政治条件分别留用。这一决定经过各课负责人酝酿讨论后，即提出具体的编整意见，经过职工代表会研究、修正，再由临时管理委员会正式讨论，最后决定施行。现该公司职员共一百六十人（材料课尚未计算在内），编余人员除一部去贸总帮助收棉花和一部进入原棉训练班学习技术外，个别人员分别介绍到农业部、铁道部工作，大部送入政治训练班学习，学习后再由政府分配工作，在学习期间本人生活由政府供给外，其家庭生活费用，均酌予补助，自愿另寻工作者，则发给两个月薪金。
