How Did Fengtai Railway Enterprise Achieve Democratic Management?
By Our Correspondent Xing Jun

　　Since June, the Fengtai Railway factories and sections have preliminarily realized democratic management. More than sixty outstanding workers were elected as members of the management committee, beginning to connect the leadership and the masses, enhancing unity among the workers, and effectively promoting production. The rapid development of the production and thrift campaign in the area since July is mainly due to the serious consideration of workers' opinions when formulating plans. For example, the workers of the locomotive section suggested that the leadership pay attention to calculating costs and overcome production blindness; during the discussion of the foreman responsibility system in the engineering section, worker representatives in the management committee, based on their personal experience, proposed that "the current division of labor based on the nature of the work is not very suitable, because before the thorough renovation of the lines, there are more concentrated and key tasks that require concentrated efforts. It is better for each track team to divide into groups within its scope and adopt the method of 'joint responsibility for section of the line'"; the issue of issuing long-term train passes for official business was a headache for the administrative head. This time, the worker representatives advocated that only the foremen of each track team and those who frequently go to the section to collect materials should be issued one each, and all others should use temporary tickets… These facts not only satisfied the workers but also changed the old staff's thinking that "it is difficult to run things when workers are in charge." Recently, the section chief voluntarily guaranteed to inspect the line on foot for 100 kilometers per month, overcoming the bureaucratic style of not going deep into the field in the past, which is also clearly a direct impact of the realization of democratic management.

　　However, being shortly after liberation, the workers' awareness is not high enough, and there are few new capable cadres. Although many old staff members have made some progress, their old ideas and old styles basically dominate, which determines the long-term nature of realizing democratic management. Therefore, the whole process is manifested as: at the beginning, the workers lacked confidence in reforming management, thinking that "the section chief has the final say anyway," "changing things around is just changing the soup but not the medicine," and "can things be done without someone who can write and calculate?" At this time, the central link should be to patiently enlighten the workers' awareness as masters. When the workers initially understand that the management committee is in their own interests, they immediately generate another emotion, expressing that it is not easy to accept that the factory (section) chief has the final say, advocating that workers should outnumber staff in the management committee (such as the bridge factory proposing a ratio of two to one), and intentionally or unintentionally reflecting the bad practices of the old supervisors in the past and the unreasonable problems in the section. After the leadership supports the workers' correct opinions and correctly explains some of their confused ideas, the workers can have a relatively complete understanding of realizing democratic management. Therefore, once the thinking is unified, the remaining issues such as election methods and the qualifications of committee members will be easily solved. Having a management committee does not mean that democratization has been achieved. After the establishment of the management committee, it is also necessary to conduct criticism and self-criticism under leadership. Naturally, at the beginning, some staff members will feel some pressure, which is necessary because it can promote their awareness, improve relations between employees, and enhance worker unity. Recently, the work of the engineering section has been particularly vigorous, which is the result of worker representatives using concrete facts to criticize the old supervisors' unbearable bureaucracy in the past, eliminating years of estrangement, and then achieving concerted efforts. Otherwise, it would be like the first establishment of the management committee in the rolling stock inspection section, where a few staff members were still in power and the workers had no opportunity to speak (later re-elected at the request of the workers), creating a gulf between the leadership and the masses.

　　Realizing democratic management is not and should not be carried out in isolation. In the process of strengthening workers' education, it is necessary to combine it with other work. Before the establishment of the management committee, the locomotive section quickly adjusted personnel and appropriately dealt with the bad elements who had oppressed the workers in the past and still did not know repentance; during the establishment of the management committee, the rolling stock inspection section found that the workers' union was not supported by the majority of the workers because the staff members were in power and mostly served the staff members. Later, it was transformed, and activists emerged. Timely explanations were given to some workers who were emotionally unstable due to unreasonable wages, explaining that appropriate adjustments would be made soon; these were all necessary. At the same time, the democratization movement was carried out on the basis of the "Red May" production surge and the "July 1st" production increase competition. The workers had demands for increased production, and the leadership emphasized the realization of democratic management to do a good job in production, so the front and back were connected, the spirit was consistent, and the phenomenon of attending to one thing and losing sight of the other was prevented.

　　The realization of democratic management in the Fengtai Railway Enterprise is only the beginning. At present, many management committee cadres have not played their due role due to lack of management experience, which first requires the leadership to consciously cultivate and improve them, and second, to strengthen the work of the workers' union and establish a workers' representative assembly. Experience has proved that the quality of the workers' union's work is directly related to the realization of democratic management. The failure to pay attention to the establishment of a workers' representative assembly at that time was a defect, which needs to be completed in a planned way from the current central work in order to more powerfully guarantee the realization of the management committee's tasks.

　　丰台铁路企业是怎样实现管理民主化的？
    本报记者  邢军
    从六月，丰台铁路各厂段，民主化管理初步实现；六十余名优秀职工，被选为管委会委员，开始沟通领导与群众的联系，增强着职工间的团结，有力的推动了生产。七月以来，该地区生产节约立功运动的迅速展开，主要由于制定计划时认真听取了工人意见。例如机务段职工，建议领导注意计算成本，克服生产盲目性；工务段在讨论工务负责制时，参加管委会的工友，以切身体验提出“目前机械按照工作性质实行分工负责制还不太适合，因为在路线未彻底整修之前，需要集中力量有重点的突击任务较多，不如各道班在所属范围内，划分小组，采取‘路线分段共同负责’的办法为好”；对规定因公发长期乘车证的问题，是行政主管最感头疼的事，此次职工代表主张除各道班工长和经常到段领料的各发一张外，其余一律应用临时票；……这些事实，不但获得工友的满意，同时转变了旧职员认为“工人当家事难办”的思想。最近段长自动保证每月步行巡查路线一百公里，克服以往不深入现场的官僚作风，也显然是实现管理民主化的直接影响。
    不过处于解放不久，工人觉悟还不够高，新的得力干部又少，许多旧职员虽有了若干进步，但旧思想、旧作风基本上占统治地位的情况下，决定了实现管理民主化的长期性；因而整个过程表现是：开始，工人对改革管理的信心不足，认为“怎么也是段长说了算”，“变来变去是换汤不换药”，“办事的还能离了能写会算的”？此时中心一环，应是耐心启发工人主人翁的自觉。当工人初步了解到管委会与自己的切身利益时，则立刻产生另一种情绪，表现对厂（段）长有最后决定权不易接受，主张管委会成员工人应多于职员（如桥厂提出工人与职员二与一之比），并有意无意的反映出旧主管以往的坏作风和本段内不合理的问题。当领导上支持了工友的正确意见，正确的解释了他们存在的某些糊涂观念之后，工友对实现管理民主化，才得以比较完整的认识。因此，思想统一了，其余选举方法，委员条件等问题，即迎刃而解。有了管委会，并不等于实现了民主化，还必须于管委会成立之后，进行有领导的批评与自我批评。自然在开始，有的职员会感到精神上的某些压力，这种压力是必要的，因为它可以促使他们的觉悟，改善员工间的关系，增强职工团结。近来工务段工作，所以特别有生气，就是经过了职工代表，拿具体事实批判了旧主管以往令人难忍的官僚主义，消除了历年的隔阂，而后达到齐心努力的结果。否则，便象检车段第一次成立管委会那样，依然少数职员当权，工人没说话机会（后来在工人要求下改选了），使领导与群众划开一条鸿沟。
    实现管理民主化，不是也不应该是孤立进行的，在加强职工教育这一过程中，必须结合其他工作。机务段在成立管委会前，迅速调整了人事，把以往欺压工人现仍不知悔过的坏分子作了适当的处理；检车段在成立管委会中，发现职工会因职员当权，多为职员办事，不为广大职工所拥护，后来进行了改造，涌现出积极分子。对某些工友因工资不合理而情绪不稳的，及时作了解释，说明不久将作适当调整；这都是必要的。同时民主化运动，是在红五月生产突击，和迎接七一增产竞赛的基础上进行的，工人有提高生产的要求，领导上就强调了实现民主化管理来搞好生产，所以前后是衔接的，精神是一致的，防止了顾此失彼的现象。
    丰台铁路企业，实现管理民主化，还仅是开始。目前不少管委会干部，因缺乏管理经验，尚未起其应起的作用，这首先需要领导上有意识的去加以培养提高，其次是加强职工会工作，建立职工代表会。经验证明，职工会工作的好坏，对实现管理民主化有着直接关系，当时没有注意建立职工代表会是一缺陷，需要从开展目前中心工作中有计划完成，以便更有力的保证管委会任务的实现。
