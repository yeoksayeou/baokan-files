    Thirty-Three Gold Shops Switch Trades
    [Tangshan Electric] With the help and guidance of the People's Government, thirty-three gold shops in Tangshan, Linxi, and Lutai have completed the exchange of their gold and silver reserves at preferential bank rates and have begun to switch trades. Most of the gold shops have switched to operating general merchandise and grain and oil businesses, or are also engaged in small-scale food processing industries. However, the seventeen gold shops in Tangshan City have not yet completely exchanged their inventory, and a small number of gold shop storefront signs have not been changed, attempting to engage in speculative trading. In addition to implementing strict supervision, the People's Bank branch has also taken control of the remaining silver ingots, urging them to switch trades as soon as possible.

    唐山林西芦台三地
    三十三家金店转业
    【唐山电】唐山、林西、芦台三地三十三家金店经人民政府帮助与劝导，已将所存金银，按银行优待牌价兑换完毕，开始转业。大部金店转营杂货、油粮业，或兼作菜米加工的小工业。但唐山市的十七家金店，存货仍未全部兑清，少数金店铺面字号也未涂改，企图兼作投机买卖。人民银行分行除实行严密监督外，并对残存的银桌子采取管制，促其及早转业。
