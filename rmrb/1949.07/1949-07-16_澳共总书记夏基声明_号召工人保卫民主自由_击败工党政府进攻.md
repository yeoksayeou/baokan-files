Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 15th: TASS Sydney, July 11th: Sharkey, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Australia, issued a statement in a special edition of the "Tribune," calling on all workers and progressive people to defend democracy and freedom and oppose the offensive of the Australian Federal Labor Government. The statement said that the Labor Government is implementing the instructions of the ruling class in an attempt to extinguish the workers' movement. Severe anti-labor bills have been passed and are being brutally enforced. Labor leaders have betrayed the workers, and they are unleashing police rule upon us. These attacks on workers' organizations are in preparation for another economic depression and are part of war preparations. The statement also emphasized that the offensive against the working class will be defeated, and the solidarity of miners and the solidarity of all workers will win the great class struggle. The law freezing union funds, the conviction of union leaders, and the Gestapo-style raid on the CPA headquarters all more effectively illustrate how the so-called Labor government serves the ruling class than any propaganda. The statement concluded by calling on the people to expose all activities of Australian fascism, demand the release of arrested union leaders, abolish anti-strike laws, demand fair handling of the coal miners' demands, and return the property forcibly taken by the police during the raid on the CPA headquarters.

    澳共总书记夏基声明
    号召工人保卫民主自由
    击败工党政府进攻
    【新华社北平十五日电】塔斯社悉尼十一日讯：澳共总书记夏基在“论坛报”特刊上发表声明，号召全体工人及进步人民保卫民主自由，反对澳大利亚联邦工党政府的进攻。该声明称，工党政府正在执行统治阶级的指示，以图扑灭工人运动。严厉的反劳工法案已经通过，并正在横蛮地施行。工党领袖背叛了工人，他们在我们面前展开了警察统治。这些对工人团体的进攻，乃是准备应付另一次经济萧条，并且是战争准备的一部分。声明同时着重指出，对工人阶级的攻势将归失败，矿工的团结和全体工人的团结，将赢得伟大的阶级斗争。工会基金冻结法、对工会领袖的判罪、对澳共总部的盖斯塔波式的突袭搜查，这一切，比任何宣传都更有效地说明了所谓工党政府是如何为统治阶级服务的。声明在结语中号召人民揭发澳大利亚法西斯主义的一切活动，要求释放被捕的工会领袖，废除反罢工法，要求公平处理煤矿工人的要求，并归还警察袭入澳共总部搜查时所强行取去的财物。
