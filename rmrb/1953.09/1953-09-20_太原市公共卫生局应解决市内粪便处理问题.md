    Taiyuan Public Health Bureau Should Address the City's Fecal Matter Disposal Problem
    A reader from Taiyuan, Pei Runmin, writes: Recently, while conducting grassroots general election work in the streets, I discovered that fecal pits within the city of Taiyuan are generally not being emptied, which is affecting cleanliness and hygiene. Last year, the Taiyuan Public Health Bureau organized farmers from the suburbs to haul away fecal matter, but once the busy farming season arrived, the farmers were unable to come and haul it away. Some farmers were charging very high prices for hauling, charging 10,000 yuan to empty one bucket of fecal matter, which residents felt was too much of a burden. This year, the Taiyuan Public Health Bureau used trucks to transport fecal matter, but this only cleared the fecal matter from a few public toilets, and the fecal matter disposal problem for the general public has still not been resolved. It is hoped that the Taiyuan Public Health Bureau will quickly find a way to solve this problem.

    太原市公共卫生局应解决市内粪便处理问题
    太原市读者裴润民来信：最近我在街道进行基层普选工作时，发现太原市市内粪坑普遍没人掏，影响清洁卫生。去年太原市公共卫生局曾组织过市郊农民拉运粪便，但是一到农忙季节，农民就不能来拉运了。有些农民拉运的价钱很高，掏一桶粪要一万元，住户都感到负担太重。今年太原市公共卫生局曾用汽车运粪，但是仅能清除几个公共厕所的粪便，至于一般市民的粪便清理问题仍然没有得到解决。希望太原市公共卫生局迅速设法解决这个问题。
