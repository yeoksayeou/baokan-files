A Message to Soldiers from the East China Military Region Liberation Army Theater Creation Studio:

My good comrades-in-arms—dear comrades of the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army:

When our Volunteer Army comrades are lying in the snow and ice of fighting Korea, fiercely striking the American aggressors, when our People's Liberation Army comrades are vigilantly guarding the motherland's islands surrounded by storms and waves, guarding the motherland's cities, factories, mines, oil fields, warehouses, and bridges day and night, don't you feel a tremendous force supporting us and encouraging us?

Yes, that is our great motherland, our heroic people.

Let us recall the support our motherland and people gave us during the Dongshan Island battle on the southeast coast in mid-July.

After the battle broke out, militiamen, workers, students, doctors, women… automatically organized transportation teams, stretcher teams, nursing teams, and medical surgery teams, regardless of fatigue and danger, braving enemy planes' strafing and bombing, throwing themselves into the battle.

In Nanshan Village, there was a militiaman named Sun Zonggui. He was a very kind farmer who had not been tempered by war. He suffered from gout in his right leg and couldn't move while lying at home, so he didn't have time to go up the mountain with the young people. The enemy entered the village and discovered him, wanting to grab him to lead the way. Seeing that he really couldn't move, the enemy had no choice but to scold him and leave. At this time, he disregarded the pain in his leg and ran to the front pit to find his team. His right leg was numb, so he used his left leg and two elbows to crawl onto the position to participate in the battle, killing and wounding more than ten enemies. The captain advised him to go down to rest, but he resolutely refused, saying, "I must fight. At this time, one more gun can kill more enemies!"

Lin Kunji, a militiaman from Jianmei Village, noticed someone hiding in the rice field. He guessed it was an enemy, so he cleverly hid in the gap in the wall, monitoring the enemy's movements. The enemy raised his gun and walked over. He thought to himself, "What should I do? If I catch him, I'm empty-handed. If I don't catch him, how can I just let the enemy go?" The enemy was getting closer, and he remembered what the instructor said: "You are a tiger, and the enemy is a mouse." Thinking of this, he suddenly gained courage. As the enemy approached the wall, Lin Kunji jumped up and shouted, "Stop!" The enemy was stunned by this sudden situation. He pretended to throw a grenade and sternly said, "Surrender your guns, or I'll blow you up!" The frightened enemy obediently raised his gun above his head and surrendered.

This is our resourceful and decisive militia, this is our fighting people.

Our reinforcements gathered in the Bachimen Strait, preparing to cross the sea by boat. Under the slogan of "Gaining time is victory," the boatmen actively responded to the call of the motherland, passing through the water columns thrown up by artillery shells, rowing quickly, and rapidly ferrying the reinforcements to the island. An old boatman was seriously injured, and his comrades wanted him to go down. He said, "Comrade soldiers, you don't leave the front line even when you are injured. Can my little injury delay the big event?" He still skillfully held the helm until he finally couldn't support it and fainted on the boat...

This is the people who are willing to sacrifice everything to support us.

The members of the "Women's Support the Front Group" in Shitan Village, hearing that there was a situation, automatically ran to the group leader He Quanzhi's place, requesting assignments. He Quanzhi led them, carrying boiling water, porridge, and firewood to our army's positions. Bullets flew past their heads, ears, and bodies, but no one slowed down their pace under the threat of death. They jumped over ditches, crossed streams, and climbed mountains to deliver water to the trenches. At this time, the soldier's heavy machine gun barrel turned red, there was no water in the storage pipe, and everyone's mouth was dry! What precious water!

The soldiers solemnly swore to the motherland: "Thank you for the people's support, we will resolutely annihilate the enemy at the foot of the mountain!"

The women replied: "Wherever the army is, we will deliver water there!"

When the soldiers were injured, the women carried the wounded back to the village, taking care of them carefully and trying to ensure their safety.

He Quanzhi encountered several bandits. Hearing their local accents, she intentionally asked:

"Are you from Dongshan?"

"What if we are?"

"Why are you here to fight your fellow villagers?"

"Alas, we were also caught by the Kuomintang to be soldiers!" one bandit said with emotion.

"Why not surrender your guns and go home to work?" He Quanzhi boldly launched a political offensive against the enemy.

"Has the Communist army's policy on prisoners changed?"

"How could it change? 'No killing of those who surrender their arms' is still the Communist army's old rule!"

"Really? Sister!"

"I guarantee it."

In this way, He Quanzhi worked to disintegrate several enemies.

These are the women of our motherland, these are the heroic people.

When the enemy invaded Dongshan City, Li Yijun, a Young Pioneer female member, contacted three other members and held a "squad meeting," solemnly swearing: "Learn from the Korean Young Pioneer guerrillas." And they passed three resolutions: 1. Write slogans to encourage the people to fight the enemy; 2. Monitor the sabotage activities of bad elements; 3. Not to succumb in front of the enemy. Immediately, they began their actions: two people stood at both ends of the street as sentries, and two people deftly pasted slogans. Soon, slogans appeared on the streets: "Fight against the Kuomintang bandit army!" "Actively support the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The enemy opened the door of the cooperative, and bad elements took the opportunity to loot. Li Yijun and the others secretly recorded their names. For those they didn't recognize, they followed them to their homes and recorded the house numbers. After the remnants of the bandits were annihilated by our army, they handed the list to the government.

Even while the battle was going on, a child braved the artillery fire to carry a load of water to our army. On the way, he was intercepted by the enemy. The enemy wanted to grab the water to drink, but he poured both buckets of water on the ground, angrily saying, "I'm sending it to the army comrades to drink, not for you!" The enemy became beastly, and this upright and brave child, in order to support his army, sacrificed himself under the bullets of the ferocious enemy!

This is our next generation, this is the children of the Mao Zedong era.

My good comrades-in-arms, can we not be moved by the heroic behavior of the heroic people of our motherland? Doesn't our heart want to say such a sentence: "What a great motherland! What heroic people!" My good comrades-in-arms, love her, defend her, with our fighting!

    伟大的祖国，英雄的人民
    华东军区解放军剧院创作室  杨履方
    我的好战友——亲爱的志愿军、解放军同志们：
    当志愿军战友们在战斗的朝鲜卧雪枕冰、狠狠地打击美国侵略者的时候，当解放军战友们警惕地守卫在周围是风暴卷着波涛的祖国海岛上，日夜警卫着祖国的城市、工厂、矿山、油田、仓库和桥梁的时候，不是感到有一股巨大的力量在支援我们、鼓舞我们吗？
    是的，那就是我们伟大的祖国，英雄的人民。
    让我们来回想一下七月中旬东南沿海东山岛战斗中祖国和人民对我们的支援吧。
    战斗发生以后，民兵、工人、学生、医生、妇女……就自动组织了运输队、担架队、护理队、医疗手术队，不顾一切疲劳和危险，冒着敌机的扫射和轰炸，投入了战斗。
    南山村有个民兵孙宗贵，他是一个十分善良的农民，没有经过战争的锻炼。他右腿患风痛病，躺在家里不能动弹，没有来得及跟年青人一起上山去。敌人进庄发现了他，要抓他去带路，见他实在不能动，敌人没办法，骂了他一顿，只好走了。这时，他顾不得腿疼，跑到前坑洞去找自己的队伍。右腿麻木了，他用左腿和两个手肘爬上阵地去，参加了战斗，打死和打伤了十多个敌人。队长劝他下去休息，他坚决不肯，说：“我一定要打，这时候，多一杆枪就能多打死几个敌人！”
    健美村的民兵林坤基，发现有一个人在稻田里躲躲闪闪地，他猜准是敌人，就机警地躲在墙垛的缺口里，监视着敌人的动静。敌人端起枪走上来了，他心想：“怎么办？抓住他吧，我是赤手空拳，不抓吧，怎能眼睁睁地放过了敌人呢？”敌人快靠近了，他想起指导员的话：“你是猛虎，敌人就是老鼠。”想到这里，陡然增加了勇气。敌人靠近墙垛了，林坤基纵身跃起，大叫一声：“站住！”敌人被这突然的情况吓呆了。他装出要扔手榴弹的姿势，厉声地说：“快缴枪，动，我就炸死你们！”惊魂未定的敌人顺从地把枪举到头上，投降了。
    这就是我们机智果敢的民兵，这就是我们战斗的人民。
    我们的增援大军集结在八尺门海峡，准备乘船渡海，船工们在“争取时间就是胜利”的口号下，积极地响应了祖国的号召，穿过被炮弹磞起来的水柱，快桨如飞，迅速地把援军渡到岛上。有个老船工身上负了重伤，同志们要他下去。他说：“大军同志，你们负了伤都不下火线，我这点伤还能误了大事？”他仍旧老练地把着舵，直到最后支持不住，晕倒在船上……
    这就是为了支援我们，不惜牺牲一切的人民。
    石坛村“妇女支前小组”的组员们，听见有了情况，都自动跑到小组长何全枝那里，请求分派任务。何全枝领着她们，挑着开水、稀饭、柴火到我军阵地上去。子弹在她们头上、耳边、身旁“嗤…嗤”地飞过去，但是没有一个人在死亡的威胁下放缓脚步。她们跳过沟，跨过溪，爬上山，把水送到战壕里去。这时战士的重机枪枪筒打红了，储水管里没水了，每个人的口都干渴了！多么珍贵的水啊！
    战士们庄严地向祖国宣誓：“感谢人民的支援，坚决把敌人消灭在山下！”
    妇女们回答说：“大军在那里，我们就把水送到那里！”
    战士们负伤了，妇女们又把伤员背回村里，一面精心看护，一面设法保障他们的安全。
    何全枝碰见了几个匪军，她听见他们讲话是本地口音，心里一动就有意地问：
    “你们是东山人吗？”
    “东山人，怎么样？”
    “你们为什么来打家乡人？”
    “唉，我们也是被国民党抓去当兵的啊！”一个匪军感慨地说。
    “缴枪投降，回家来生产不好么？”何全枝大胆地向敌人展开了政治攻势。
    “解放军的俘虏政策变了没有？”
    “怎么能变？‘缴枪不杀’还不是解放军的老规矩！”
    “真的？大嫂！”
    “我担保。”
    何全枝就这样，争取瓦解了几个敌人。
    这就是我们祖国的妇女，这就是英雄的人民。
    敌人侵入东山城时，少年先锋队女队员李艺君和另外三个队员联系，开了一次“小队会议”，庄严地宣誓：“向朝鲜少年游击队学习。”并且通过了三项决议：一、写标语鼓舞人民与敌人作斗争；二、监视坏分子的破坏活动；三、不在敌人面前屈服。马上，她们就开始了行动：两个人站在街道两头放哨，两个人敏捷地贴标语。很快，街头上就出现了：“向国民党匪军作斗争！”“积极支援英勇的中国人民解放军！”“毛主席万岁！”的口号。
    敌人打开了合作社大门，坏分子乘机抢掠，李艺君她们就暗地里记下他们的姓名。不认识的人，就尾随到他家，记下门牌号数。残匪被我军歼灭后，她们就把名单交给政府。
    还在战斗进行的时候，有一个孩子冒着炮火挑了一担水送给我们军队，半路上，被敌人截住了。敌人要抢水喝，他把两桶水都倒在地下，气愤愤地说：“我是送给大军同志喝的，不给你们喝！”敌人发了兽性，这个正直而勇敢的孩子，为了支援自己的军队，牺牲在凶暴的敌人的子弹下！
    这就是我们的下一代，这就是毛泽东时代的儿童。
    我的好战友，我们能不为祖国的英雄的人民这种英雄的行为所感动吗？我们的心里不想说出这样一句话吗：“多么伟大的祖国！多么英雄的人民啊！”我的好战友，爱她吧，保卫她吧，用我们的战斗！
