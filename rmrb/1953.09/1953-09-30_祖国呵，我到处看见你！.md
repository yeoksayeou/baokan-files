Oh, Motherland, I See You Everywhere!
Zhu Ziqi

I have traveled through the villages and cities of many countries,
I have made friends and brothers in Europe and the Americas,
In these fiery days and months of fighting for peace,
Oh, Motherland, I see you and hear you everywhere!
I see you! In the cheers of "Long Live China" that shook the Vienna Music Hall,
In the flags flying in Budapest Square that read "Salute to Mao Zedong,"
In the applause that resounded for a long time in the Santiago National Theater welcoming the Beijing delegation,
And also in the mourning music played in Paris for our good friend Fajon...
Oh! The youths of Bucharest parade with Huang Jiafu, a hero of the Volunteer Army,
The girls of Copenhagen present flowers and gifts to Sun Xiaoju, a model female worker.
Oh! The hands of the Warsaw audience saluting the Chinese song and dance troupe have just been lowered,
The glorious Smetana Theater in Prague is filled with cheers for the Chinese acrobatic troupe again!
Motherland, I see you and hear you everywhere! When we see and hear you,
An excited cry echoes in each of our hearts:
Dear Motherland, how glorious we are as your people!
Dear Chairman Mao, how happy we are as your children!

It was the snowy and freezing winter days of December 1952,
Suddenly, the good news from Shangganling was spread to the venue of the World People's Peace Congress,
Suddenly, Chairman Fajon read out the ode sent by the Anglo-American prisoners of war in Korea to the Congress.
Friends waved to congratulate us, and cheers of great joy rang out endlessly.
Good, good, you have made the American aggressors lose face!
Good, good, you have won honor for us!
It was the sultry summer days of June 1953,
Robbers ran amok south of the 38th parallel, and bandits appeared on the streets of Berlin!
Everyone anxiously watched this low-clouded sky with anger,
Suddenly, the iron hammer of the Chinese and Korean people swung and beat the rabid mad dogs half to death.
The poet Kuba cheered by the Rhine River: "Well done! Well done!"
The sculptor Seitz said: "Chinese People's Volunteers, you are the number one peace fighters in my heart!"

It was by the wide Hungarian sea—Lake Balaton, the children gathered,
It was in the morning when the spring was rippling and the rosy clouds were flying, the children gathered,
A Young Pioneer wearing a red scarf recited Chairman Mao's poem on the Long March,
The listeners were as quiet as lake water, and the sound of the poem resounded into the clouds,
Just like the people by Beihai in Beijing could hear it.
It was in a small Czechoslovak village under the Tatras, the music was playing,
It was on the wheat field in the summer dusk celebrating the harvest, the music was playing,
A group of cooperative farm women in national costumes were doing the Hebei Yangko dance,
The music became more and more energetic, and the dancers danced more and more happily,
Just like stepping on the soft threshing floor of the Jizhong Plain.
It was in Leipzig, at the international fair where tens of thousands rushed,
We saw the magnificent Chinese Pavilion standing in the center like a palace,
Countless rows of visitors are countless currents, never ending!
Countless rows of visitors praised in unison: Walking into the Chinese Pavilion is like entering a garden,
On the right are agricultural products piled up like mountains, and on the left are the roaring sounds of machines.
In the palace, the loudspeaker broadcasts familiar songs: "Stalin! Mao Zedong!"
Outside the palace, German young men and women dance and sing.

Once, a young man who escaped from the Salazar barbed wire fence ran to us, [1]
His comforting words were filled with hope: I finally met you, Chinese comrades!
His comforting words conveyed the heavy breathing of fishermen and porters from the Iberian Peninsula...
His scorching hands handed over a photo of Chairman Mao: "Secretly printed by workers in Lisbon.
Let this simple respect be our gift, please take it to Beijing."
That gray-haired Brazilian old man, why do you keep talking about China to everyone?
Why do you seem like a child with tears in your eyes when you talk about China?
He said, only because there I saw the future of my country!
Only because there I understood the true meaning of the word "great" for the first time.
He said, when I drank sweet rice wine with the farmers who were given land in South China,
I thought of my brothers crawling in the coffee fields: Get up! Saadi! [2]
Oh! Respected Italian comrade Guaglini lies sleeping on the road of battle,
When he lay down, he did not forget to sing his favorite song praising the Chinese Long March heroes:
"The invincible sons and daughters of workers and peasants shattered the medieval Great Wall of the East,
I salute the poet, the commander, and the glorious land of his golden-faced soldiers!" [3]
When I and international friends sit around the campfire on autumn nights for vacation,
Who will start humming "The East is Red" again? The tune is so deep and moving.
The friends who hum "The East is Red" are Spanish, Syrian, Tunisian...

Thank Chairman Mao! He allows the citizens of our glorious People's Republic of China,
To walk proudly through every place in the world singing songs of peace and friendship.
When the smiling and beautiful Chinese image appears on the streets and alleys,
People everywhere wave and greet us.
Praises come from all directions! Envious eyes shoot from all directions!
We are free people who have stood up and become masters of the country!
We are the great Chinese people who are advancing shoulder to shoulder with our glorious Soviet brothers!

I have traveled through the villages and cities of many countries,
Oh, Motherland, I see you and hear you everywhere!
How many friends shouted "Cheers!" to welcome your first five-year plan!
How many friends shouted "Long live peace!" to celebrate your brilliant achievements! [4]
Oh, Motherland, every step you take forward brings a huge echo in the world,
The world is full of hope listening to your footsteps, forward, China! My motherland!
Although I am in the distant West, my heart is always beating by your side!
Every time I see and hear you, happiness surges in my heart!
This great happiness calls us to meet new victories and enter into greater struggles!
This great happiness commands every son and daughter of the motherland to advance more bravely in their respective positions!
Written in Prague, September 1953

[1] Salazar was the Prime Minister of the Portuguese fascist government.
[2] Saadi is a common nickname for Brazilians.
[3] Italian comrade Guaglini died of illness at the World Peace Council in Prague this spring. After his death, a passionate long poem praising the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and Chairman Mao was found in his drawer, and these are two lines from the poem.
[4] Chinese words such as "Cheers" and "Long Live Peace" are often heard at international gatherings or banquets.

专栏：

    祖国呵，我到处看见你！
    朱子奇
    一
    我走过了好些国家的乡村和城市，
    我结识了许多欧洲和美洲的朋友和兄弟，
    在为和平而斗争的这些红火的日月里，
    祖国呵，我到处看见你又听见你！
    我看见你！在震动维也纳音乐厅的“中国万岁”的欢呼声中，
    在写着“向毛泽东致敬”的飘扬在布达佩斯广场的旗帜上，
    在圣地牙哥国家剧院久久轰响的迎接北京代表的掌声里，
    也在巴黎为我们的好朋友法奇而奏出的哀乐里……
    呵！布加勒斯特的青年们抬着志愿军英雄黄家富游行，
    哥本哈根的姑娘们向模范女工孙孝菊献花献礼。
    呵！华沙的观众向中国歌舞队致敬的手刚放下，
    辉煌的布拉格斯密达剧院为中国杂技团的叫好声又腾起！
    祖国，我到处看见你又听见你！当看到和听到你的时候，
    我们每个人的心里都重复响起一阵激动的呼声：
    亲爱的祖国呵，我们作为你的人民是多么光荣！
    亲爱的毛主席呵，我们作为你的儿女是多么幸福！
　　二
    是一九五二年十二月雪花飘飘的严冬日子，
    突然，上甘岭喜报传到了世界人民和平大会会场，
    突然，主席法奇念出寄自朝鲜英美战俘致大会的颂词。
    朋友们向我们扬手道贺，痛快万分的喊声响个不止。
    好哇，好哇，你们使美国侵略者丢了脸！
    好哇，好哇，你们为我们争得了荣誉！
    是一九五三年六月那一串闷热的夏天的日子，
    强盗们横行在三八线南，匪徒出现在柏林街头！
    人人愤怒而焦虑地注视着这低云的天空，
    突然，中朝人民的铁锤舞动，把狂吠的疯狗打个半死。
    诗人库巴在莱茵河边喝采：“打得妙！打得妙！”
    雕刻家赛兹说：“中国人民志愿军呵，你是我心中的第一位和平战士！”
　　三
    是在宽阔的匈牙利海—巴尔东湖旁，孩子们集合了，
    是正当春光荡漾、朝霞飞舞的早晨，孩子们集合了，
    一个戴红领巾的少先队员念起了毛主席的长征词哩，
    听诗的人静如湖水，念诗的声音响入云霄，
    就像北京的北海边的人们也能听到。
    是在达达尔山下一个捷克斯洛伐克小村庄，音乐在响，
    是在庆贺丰收的夏日黄昏时分的麦田上，音乐在响，
    一群身穿民族服的合作社农妇在扭河北秧歌舞哩，
    音乐声愈奏愈起劲，跳舞的人愈跳愈欢，
    就像踩在柔和的冀中平原打谷场上。
    是在莱比锡呵，在那万人奔赴的国际集市上，
    我们看见宫殿似的雄伟壮丽的中国馆立在中央，
    无数排参观行列是无数股奔流，永远流不完！
    无数排参观行列同声颂扬：走进中国馆好像到了花园，
    右边是农业品堆成山，左边是机器声隆隆响。
    宫殿里，扩音机播出人们熟悉的歌声：“斯大林！毛泽东！”
    宫殿外，德国青年男女一面舞来一面唱。
　　四
    有一次，一个逃出萨拉查铁丝网的青年奔向我们，〔一〕
    欣慰的话里浸透着希望：我终于见到你们，中国同志！
    欣慰的话里传出伊比利亚半岛渔夫和搬运工人的沉重呼吸……
    灼热的手递来一张毛主席的像片：“里斯本工人秘密印行。
    就让这朴素的敬意作为我们的礼物，请捎到北京去吧。”
    那位满头银发的巴西老人，你为何见人就谈中国谈个不休？
    为何一谈中国你就好像小孩似的热泪满眶呢？
    他说，为只为在那儿我瞧见了我的祖国的未来！
    为只为在那儿我第一次懂得了“伟大”这个字的真实含意。
    他说，当我在南中国和分得地的农民同饮甜米酒时，
    就想起我那匍匐在咖啡地里的兄弟：起来哟！萨地！〔二〕
    呵！敬爱的意大利同志瓜格里尼长眠在战斗的路途，
    躺下时，还不忘唱他那首心爱的颂扬中国长征英雄的歌：
    “百战百胜的工农子弟冲碎了东方中世纪的长城，
    我向诗人、统帅和他的黄金面孔士兵的光辉国土致敬！”〔三〕
    当我和国际友人围坐在秋夜的营火边度假日时，
    就会听到谁又哼起“东方红”呢？音调那般深沉动人。
    哼起“东方红”的朋友是西班牙人、叙利亚人、突尼斯人……
    五
    感谢毛主席！他让我们光荣的中华人民共和国的公民们，
    唱着和平与友爱的歌阔步走过世上各个地方。
    当微笑着的美丽的中国人形象出现在大街小巷时，
    到处的人们向我们招手问候。
    赞美声四面传来！羡慕的眼光四面射来！
    我们是站起来了的作了国家主人的自由人民！
    我们是和光荣的苏维埃弟兄并肩前进的伟大中国人民！
    六
    我走过了好些国家的乡村和城市，
    祖国啊，我到处看见你又听见你！
    多少友人为欢迎你的第一个五年计划而高呼“干杯！”
    多少友人为庆贺你的辉煌成就而高呼“和平万岁！”〔四〕
    祖国啊，你每一个前进的足音，都在世上召来巨大回声，
    世界充满希望倾听你的足音，前进，中国！我的祖国！
    我虽然在辽远的西方，但心儿永远在你身边跳动！
    每当看见和听到你时，就心头涌着幸福！
    这莫大的幸福召唤我们迎向新的胜利进入更大的斗争！
    这莫大的幸福命令每个祖国儿女在各自岗位上更勇猛前进！
    一九五三年九月写成于布拉格
    〔一〕萨拉查是葡萄牙法西斯政府的总理。
    〔二〕萨地是巴西人常用的小名。
    〔三〕意大利同志瓜格里尼今年春天病逝于布拉格世界和平理事
          会。去世后，在他的抽屉里发现一篇歌颂中国工农红军和
          毛主席的热情的长诗，这是诗中的两句。
    〔四〕像“干杯”“和平万岁”这类中国话，在国际集会上或宴
          会上常听到。
