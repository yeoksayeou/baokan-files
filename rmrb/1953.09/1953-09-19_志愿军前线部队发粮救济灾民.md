Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th. Following the decision and instructions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army leadership to allocate 1 million catties of grain to relieve the people of Korea in the war zone, the frontline units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are currently working with local Korean governments to distribute the relief grain.

　　After the relief grain arrived in the central frontline area, the leading organs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units stationed in this area and the local Korean government formed many joint working groups to conduct in-depth investigations of the disaster situation in various villages and planned the distribution. A working group in the Shangganling war zone worked continuously for more than ten days, distributing more than 50,000 catties of relief grain, helping more than 2,000 people in the area who had suffered from the war. Seok Gil-rong, a female member of the Korean Democratic Youth League who was gloriously wounded in the Shangganling Campaign for supporting our army, received 2,000 catties of relief grain. The thirty-six orphans in Lipseok-ri, Cheorwon County, not only received relief grain, but also received a large number of stationery and books donated by a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. A certain unit of the Volunteer Army on the Kim Sung front has also distributed more than 47,000 catties of relief grain to disaster victims in the war zone.

　　A portion of the distributed relief grain was voluntarily saved from the rations of cadres and soldiers of various units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. A certain unit of the Volunteer Army on the western front donated more than 203,000 catties of saved grain and a large number of clothes, shoes, and socks, etc. A certain unit of the Volunteer Army on the Pyeonggang front also donated more than 20,000 catties of saved grain to the Korean people in the驻地.

　　The selfless help and relief activities of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have greatly encouraged and strengthened the enthusiasm and confidence of the Korean people in the war zone to restore production and rebuild their homes. An elderly Korean man who was building a house carved the words "Volunteer Army" on the roof beam after receiving relief grain. He said: "I want my descendants to know that this house was built with the grain given by the Volunteer Army." Farmer Shin Min-chun said: "This year's crops in my family were planted with the help of the Volunteer Army, and now the Volunteer Army is distributing grain to help us. I will never forget this kindness." After receiving relief grain, many families of the Korean People's Army wrote letters to tell their children. Some Korean people also wrote letters to the Volunteer Army to express their heartfelt thanks. The Korean people in the three villages of Im Nam, Du Mok, and Hak Bang on the Kim Sung front, who received relief, wrote more than 70 letters of thanks to the Volunteer Army. Farmer Shin Geum-sook wrote in a letter: "We will respond to Marshal Kim Il-sung's call with practical actions to restore production and thank the excellent sons and daughters sent by the great Chinese people – the Chinese People's Volunteer Army – for their meticulous care for us."

    志愿军前线部队发粮救济灾民
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】中国人民志愿军领导机关拨粮一百万斤救济战区朝鲜人民的决定和指示下达后，目前中国人民志愿军前线各部队正协同各地朝鲜政府，进行救济粮食的发放工作。
    救济粮到达中部前线地区后，驻在这个地区的中国人民志愿军部队领导机关和当地朝鲜政府组成了许多联合工作组，深入各里调查灾情，并进行了有计划的发放。在上甘岭战区的一个工作组，连续工作十多天，发放救济粮五万多斤，使这个地区遭受战争灾害的人民二千多人得到了帮助。曾在上甘岭战役中因支援我军作战而光荣负伤的朝鲜民主青年同盟女盟员石吉荣得到救济粮二千斤，铁原郡立石里的三十六个孤儿不但得到了救济粮，同时还得到了志愿军某部赠送的大批文具和书籍。金城前线志愿军某部也已将救济粮四万七千多斤，发放给战区灾民。
    在发放的救济粮食中，有一部分是中国人民志愿军各部队的干部、战士自动从自己伙食中节省出来的。西部前线志愿军某部捐献了节约粮食二十万三千多斤和大批衣服、鞋袜等，平康前线志愿军某部也将节约的两万多斤粮食，捐赠驻地的朝鲜人民。
    中国人民志愿军无私的帮助和救济活动，极大地鼓舞和加强了战区朝鲜人民恢复生产、重建家园的热情和信心。有一位正在修建房子的朝鲜老人得到救济粮后，在屋梁上刻了“志愿军”三个字。他说：“我要让子孙后代都知道：这所房子是吃着志愿军救济的粮食盖成的。”农民辛民春说：“我家今年的庄稼是志愿军帮助种的，现在志愿军又发粮救济我们，这种恩情我永远不会忘记。”许多朝鲜人民军家属们收到救济粮后，纷纷写信告诉自己的子弟。有的朝鲜人民还写信给志愿军表示衷心的感谢。金城前线受到救济的任南、杜木、鹤芳三个里的朝鲜人民，给志愿军写了七十多封感谢信。农民申金叔在信上写道：“我们要用恢复生产的实际行动来回答金日成元帅的号召，并感谢伟大的中国人民派来的优秀子弟——中国人民志愿军对我们无微不至的关心。”
