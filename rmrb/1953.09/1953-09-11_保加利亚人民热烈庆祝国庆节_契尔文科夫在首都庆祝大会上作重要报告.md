(Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 10th) The Bulgarian people warmly celebrated the ninth anniversary of the National Day of the People's Republic of Bulgaria (September 9th).

On the eve of the National Day—the 8th—a grand celebration meeting was held in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Present at the meeting were Heroes of Socialist Labor, Dimitrov Prize winners, representatives of the People's Army, workers in science and literature, as well as diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Vulko Chervenkov, participated in the celebration meeting and delivered an important report at the meeting. In his report, he first expressed his deep respect to the great Soviet people and the glorious Soviet army. He then summarized the tremendous achievements of the Bulgarian people in implementing the first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953). He said that Bulgaria's first Five-Year Plan had been basically completed in four years. From 1949 to 1952, Bulgaria had manufactured hundreds of new types of industrial products. In 1952, our heavy industry produced in fifty-six days the equivalent of the total output of all heavy industry throughout 1939. More than half of the poor and middle peasants in the country have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives. The food problem has been solved. The material and cultural level of the working people has been greatly improved. The output of consumer goods in 1952 has doubled compared to 1948 and increased by two times compared to 1939. The average real wage of industrial workers throughout the year in 1952 increased by more than 38 percent compared to 1939. The second Five-Year Plan, which is about to be submitted to the National Assembly for deliberation, will bring the entire national economy completely under socialist control, further develop socialist industry and transportation, make science and art more prosperous, and further improve the material life and cultural level of the working people. Our urgent task is to ensure, in the next few years, on the basis of further developing agriculture, the supply of sufficient marketable grain to the residents and sufficient raw materials to the industry.

Chervenkov talked about the international situation, and he emphasized the willingness of the Bulgarian government to resolve some outstanding issues with its neighbors—Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia. He said: The Bulgarian people believe that the peaceful policies of the countries of the peaceful and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, as well as all peaceful forces, will further ease international tensions and further isolate the warmongers. The Bulgarian people will contribute all their strength to this noble goal.

Chervenkov's report was met with warm applause from the audience.

On September 9th, a grand military parade and a procession of 300,000 people were held in Sofia's "9/9" Square. Celebratory processions were also held in Plovdiv, Stalin (Varna) , Ruse, and other cities in Bulgaria.

    保加利亚人民热烈庆祝国庆节
    契尔文科夫在首都庆祝大会上作重要报告
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚人民热烈庆祝保加利亚人民共和国国庆（九月九日）九周年。
    在国庆节前夕——八日，保加利亚首都索非亚举行了隆重的庆祝大会。到会的有社会主义劳动英雄、季米特洛夫奖金得奖人、人民军的代表、科学和文艺工作者，以及苏联和各人民民主国家的外交使节。
    保加利亚人民共和国部长会议主席伏·契尔文科夫参加了庆祝大会，并在会上作了重要的报告。他在报告中首先向伟大的苏联人民和光荣的苏联军队表示深切的敬意。接着他综述了保加利亚人民执行第一个五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）的巨大成就。他说，保加利亚第一个五年计划已在四年内基本上完成了。从一九四九年到一九五二年间，保加利亚已经制造了数百种新式的工业品。一九五二年，我们的重工业在五十六天中所生产的产品，就相当于一九三九年全年全部重工业的产量。全国有一半以上的贫农和中农都参加了农业生产合作社。粮食问题已经解决了。劳动人民的物质和文化水平已大为提高。一九五二年消费品产量已比一九四八年增加了一倍，比一九三九年增加了两倍。一九五二年产业工人全年的平均实际工资，比一九三九年增加百分之三十八以上。即将提交国民议会审议的第二个五年计划，将使整个国民经济完全受社会主义的控制，使社会主义工业和运输业进一步发展，使科学和艺术更加繁荣，劳动人民物质生活和文化水平更加提高。我们刻不容缓的任务就是：在最近几年中要在进一步发展农业的基础上，保证以充足的商品粮食供给居民，以充足的原料供给工业。
    契尔文科夫谈到了国际形势，他着重指出了保加利亚政府愿与邻国——土耳其、希腊、南斯拉夫——解决一些悬而未决的问题的意愿。他说：保加利亚人民相信，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国的和平政策以及一切和平力量，将使国际紧张局势得到更进一步的缓和，并使战争贩子更进一步孤立起来。保加利亚人民将为这一崇高的目的贡献出全部的力量。
    契尔文科夫的报告不断博得全场热烈的掌声。
    九月九日，索非亚的“九九”广场上举行了盛大的阅兵和三十万人的游行。在普罗夫迪夫、斯大林城、鲁西和保加利亚其他城市，也举行了庆祝节日的游行。
