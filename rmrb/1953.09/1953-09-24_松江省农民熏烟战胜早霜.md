    Songjiang Province Farmers Use Smoke to Combat Early Frost
    Farmers in Songjiang Province, promoting the advanced Soviet experience of frost prevention using the smoke method, combatted early frost, preventing serious damage to the ripening autumn crops. A general frost occurred in Songjiang Province on September 16th and 17th. After receiving a weather forecast about the cold wave from the meteorological station in advance, the Provincial People's Government immediately telegraphed instructions to the county people's governments to lead farmers in setting fires to create smoke in order to prevent frost damage. The county people's governments then organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to mobilize farmers to create smoke. The Baoqing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Baoqing County People's Government dispatched nearly a hundred cadres to the countryside overnight to help farmers prepare smoking materials and educate farmers on fire prevention matters. Farmers in various places made relatively full preparations, placing firewood and artemisia around the farmland in advance; many rural areas adopted the method of dividing the village's land into sections with assigned responsibility to ensure that all cultivated land could be smoked. The early frost was basically defeated everywhere. Crops that were slightly damaged by frost due to thin smoke were mostly able to recover, which would not hinder the harvest.

    松江省农民熏烟战胜早霜
    松江省农民推行苏联防冻的先进经验熏烟办法，战胜早霜侵袭，使即将成熟的秋禾未受严重损害。松江省各县九月十六、十七两天普遍降霜。省人民政府在事前接到气象台关于寒潮来袭的预报后，立即电令各县人民政府领导农民点火熏烟，以防霜害。各县人民政府随即组织大批干部下乡，动员农民熏烟。中共宝清县委员会和宝清县人民政府派出近百名干部连夜下乡，帮助农民准备熏烟物资，和教育农民注意防火等事宜。各地农民都作了较充分的准备工作，事先将柴草和青蒿放在农田周围准备着；很多农村为使全村耕地都能熏着烟，采取了全村土地分片包干的办法。各地基本上战胜了早霜的侵害，有些因烟大稀薄稍受霜害的作物，也大部可以恢复原状，对收成无大妨碍。
