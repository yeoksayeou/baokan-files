Building Protective Forest Belts to Transform Sandy Wasteland into Fertile Soil
Grain Production in Eastern Henan Sandy Area Increases by 20 Percent

After the construction of protective forest belts to block wind and sand in the sandy areas of eastern Henan, many sandy wastelands and alkaline lands have begun to be planted with crops and fruit trees. Before liberation, due to the repeated course changes of the Yellow River, especially the dyke breach at Huayuankou by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in 1938, millions of mu of uncultivable sandy wasteland and alkaline land were created in eastern Henan. Every spring and winter, the north wind brought yellow sand, filling the sky. In the sandy areas, some cultivable land had extremely low yields due to the impact of wind and sand. The peasants had been living in poverty.

After liberation, in order to improve the lives of the people in the sandy areas, the People's Government established a sandy wasteland afforestation management office to lead the masses in planting trees and fighting against wind and sand. In the past four years, a total of 46 million trees have been planted along the Yellow River flooded area, protecting 2 million mu of farmland. Key large areas of sandy wasteland have been basically eliminated. The distribution of protective forest belts can be roughly divided into two major systems: one starts from Zhengzhou, passing through Zhongmu, Weishi, Fugou, Xihua to Huaiyang, with a total length of about 250 kilometers; the other starts from Lanfeng, eastward through Minquan, Shangqiu to Yucheng, with a total length of about 100 kilometers. In addition, three small forest belts have also been built between Lanfeng, Kaocheng and Caoxian in Shandong, Yuxiangpu in Minquan and Suixian, and between Minquan and Ningling. The trees in the protective forest belts are now generally two to three meters high, with the highest reaching seven meters. The forest belts are like green walls, blocking the shifting sand within and near the forest belts, allowing crops to grow safely in a suitable environment. Since afforestation, many sandy wastelands that could not be cultivated and cultivated land that could only grow autumn crops have now begun to be cultivated or have increased yields. A large area of wasteland in northern Minquan County, which had never been planted with crops, has been reclaimed more than 3,000 mu since afforestation in 1950. Tucheng Township in the suburbs of Kaifeng was a severely sandy area. In 1950, there was not a single mu of wheat field. In 1951, 710 mu of wheat were planted, with an average yield of 46 jin per mu. Last year, 1,171 mu of wheat were planted, with an average yield of 90 jin per mu. This year, the wheat planting area has been expanded to 3,200 mu, and the yield per mu has increased to 110 jin, with the highest yield reaching 350 jin. Peasants in the sandy areas generally report that the yield of general cultivated land has increased by 20 percent after afforestation. Due to the expansion of cultivated land area and the increase in yield, the lives of peasants in the sandy areas have also been greatly improved. In Yifeng Village, District Four of Lanfeng County, when afforestation began in 1950, the entire village had only one cart and 24 head of livestock, and the annual harvest of wheat was 18 dan. After the protective forest grew, the entire village harvested more than 100 dan of wheat this year, the number of livestock gradually increased to 65, four carts were added, and more than 30 thatched houses were built. In the sandy area, there have also appeared large-scale orchards. The horticulture group of Yifeng Forest Farm cultivated more than 1,400 mu of apples, 68 mu of pears, and 96 mu of grapes. The forest farm and the masses jointly cultivated more than 560 mu of apples, 47 mu of pears, and 44 mu of peaches. It is estimated that in five or six years, an annual income of 7 billion yuan can be obtained.

Now, the counties in eastern Henan are planning to adjust the existing forest network and forest belts, and add a wider backbone forest belt: starting from Zhengzhou, passing through Zhongmu, Kaifeng, Lanfeng, Minquan, Shangqiu and other counties, extending to Anhui, to prevent the severe north wind and the flying sand caused by the Yellow River precipitation period. At the same time, promote grass cultivation and sand fixation on shifting sand dunes, in order to completely eliminate sandy wasteland. In addition, mobilize the masses to cultivate a large number of fruit trees, and cultivate pit wood forests and fuelwood forests to develop the rural economy and improve people's lives. Plant green manure crops and implement pasture rotation to improve the soil in the sandy area and increase pasture production. In a few years, this poor and backward sandy area will be transformed into an agricultural area with fertile land and abundant products.

    营造防护林带争取变沙荒为沃土
    河南省东部沙区农作物增产二成
    河南东部沙区营造防护林带拦阻风沙后，许多沙荒和碱地已开始种植农作物和果树。解放以前，由于黄河历次改道，特别是蒋介石匪帮一九三八年在花园口决堤放水，在河南东部地区造成数百万亩不能耕种的沙荒和碱地。每年春冬两季，北风一起，黄沙满天。沙区中，一些可以耕种的土地，因受风沙影响，产量极低。农民们一直是过着穷困的生活。
    解放后，人民政府为了改善沙区人民生活，特建立沙荒造林管理处，领导沙区群众植树造林，向风沙作斗争。四年来，沿着黄河泛道共已造林四千六百万株，可防护农田达二百万亩，重点大片沙荒已经基本上消灭。防护林带的分布约可分为两大系统：一是自郑州起，经中牟、尉氏、扶沟、西华至淮阳，全长约二百五十公里；一是自兰封起，东经民权、商邱至虞城，全长约一百公里。另在兰封、考城及山东曹县之间，民权、睢县榆厢铺，民权、宁陵之间也建造了三条小型林带。防护林带的树木，现在一般已高达二、三公尺，最高者达七公尺。林带像绿色的城墙，把流沙拦阻在林带内及其附近，使农作物得在适宜的环境内安全生长。自造林以后，许多不能耕种的沙荒和只能种植秋季作物的耕地，现在已经开始耕种或增加了产量。民权县北部从未种过庄稼的大片荒地，自一九五○年造林后，已开垦了三千多亩。开封郊区土城乡是沙荒严重地区，一九五○年没有一亩麦田，一九五一年种小麦七百一十亩，每亩平均收四十六斤，去年种小麦一千一百七十一亩，每亩平均产量九十斤，今年小麦种植面积扩大到三千二百亩，每亩产量提高到一百一十斤，最高产量达三百五十斤。沙区农民普遍反映：造林后，一般耕地产量已增加二成。由于耕地面积的扩大和产量的提高，沙区农民生活也大大改善。兰封县四区仪封村，一九五○年开始造林时，全村只有一辆大车、二十四头牲口，全年收获麦子十八担。防护林长起来后，今年全村收了一百多担麦子，牲口逐渐增到六十五头，添了四辆大车，还盖了三十多间草房。在沙区内，还出现了规模宏大的果园，仪封林场园艺组栽培了苹果一千四百多亩，梨六十八亩，葡萄九十六亩。林场和群众合伙栽培苹果五百六十多亩，梨四十七亩，桃四十四亩。预计五、六年后，每年能得收益七十亿元。
    现在，河南东部各县正在计划着调整现有林网林带，加建一条较宽的基干林带：从郑州起，穿过中牟、开封、兰封、民权、商邱等县，延伸到安徽，以阻止北来剧风和黄河降水期所起的飞沙。同时在流动沙丘上，推广育草固沙，以期全面彻底地消灭沙荒。另外，发动群众，大量栽培果树，培育坑木林、薪炭林，以发展农村经济，改善人民生活。种植绿肥作物，实行牧草轮作，以改良沙区土壤和增加牧草产量。几年以后，这个贫困落后的沙区，将可变成一个土地肥沃、物产丰饶的农业区域。
