    National Native Products Conference Opens in Beijing Yesterday
    [This newspaper dispatch] To study the national situation regarding the exchange of native products, to strengthen guidance on the production and sales of native products going forward, and to determine the principles and policies of native products management, the National Native Products Conference, under the auspices of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government, opened in Beijing on September 21. Participating in the conference were responsible persons from relevant departments at the central level, representatives from commercial administrative departments of major administrative regions and provinces (cities), managers from native product companies, trading companies, ethnic minority trading companies, and hemp companies of major administrative regions and provinces (cities), as well as representatives from cooperatives in some areas of North China, totaling more than 150 people.
    Wu Jianhua, Acting Director of the Agricultural Products Procurement Bureau of the Central Ministry of Commerce, and Chen Jingzhi, Deputy Manager of the China Native Products Company, reported at the first day of the meeting on the significance of convening the National Native Products Exchange Conference, as well as the main content and tasks of the conference. They pointed out in their reports that in the past three years, the exchange of native products has been widely carried out throughout the country, and great achievements have been made. The primary task of this conference is to summarize the experience of native product exchanges and to study the guidelines and tasks of native product exchanges during the period of the country's planned economic construction, in order to strengthen guidance on the production and sales of native products, expand mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and consolidate the worker-peasant economic alliance. At the same time, it was pointed out that since the dissolution of the China Native Products Company in August of last year, state-owned commercial departments in various regions have lacked unified leadership in the management of native products, and therefore, blind deviations have occurred in purchasing and sales businesses in various regions. In order to adapt to the needs of national economic construction and development, and to strengthen leadership over the management of native products, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council decided to establish the China Native Products Company, under the leadership of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Commerce, to be responsible for leading the business work related to native products of native products companies, trading companies, ethnic minority trading companies, and hemp companies throughout the country.
    In order to properly determine the current management principles and tasks of native products, and to ensure that the native product purchasing and sales plans of various regions are mutually coordinated, the conference will also organize internal exchanges. Currently, representatives from major administrative regions and provinces have begun to report on the production and sales of native products at the meeting.

    全国土产会议昨天在北京开幕
    【本报讯】为了研究全国土产交流情况，加强今后土产产销工作的指导，确定土产经营的方针和政策，全国土产会议在中央人民政府商业部的主持下，于九月二十一日在京开幕。参加这次会议的，有中央一级有关部门的负责人，各大行政区、省（市）商业行政部门的代表和各大行政区、省（市）土产公司、贸易公司、少数民族贸易公司、烟麻公司的经理，以及华北某些地区的合作社的代表等共一百五十多人。
    中央商业部农产品收购局代理局长吴建华和中国土产公司副经理陈静之在第一天的会议上报告了召开全国土产交流会议的意义以及会议的主要内容和任务。他们在报告中指出：过去三年来，在全国范围内广泛开展了土产交流工作，并且有了很大的成绩。这次大会的首要任务是总结土产交流的经验，研究在国家有计划的经济建设时期中土产交流的方针和任务，以便加强对土产产销工作的指导，扩大城乡互助，巩固工农经济联盟。同时指出，从去年八月间中国土产公司撤销后，各地国营商业部门在土产经营上缺乏统一的领导，因此各地在购销业务中发生了盲目的偏向。为了适应国家经济建设发展的需要，加强对土产经营的领导，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会决定设立中国土产公司，在中央人民政府商业部的领导下，负责领导全国各地土产公司、贸易公司、民族贸易公司、烟麻公司有关土产的业务工作。
    为了很好地确定目前土产的经营方针和任务，使各地区的土产购销计划互相衔接，会议并将组织内部交流。现在，各大行政区、各省的代表已开始在会上汇报土产产销情况。
