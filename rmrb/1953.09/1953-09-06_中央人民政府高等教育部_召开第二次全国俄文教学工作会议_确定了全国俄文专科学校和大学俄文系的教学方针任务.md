    The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government convened the Second National Russian Language Teaching Work Conference in August, determining the policy and tasks of the teaching work of national Russian language specialized schools and university Russian language departments.
    With the progress of national construction, Russian language schools nationwide have greatly developed. Currently, there are seven regular Russian language specialized schools and ten universities with Russian language departments (groups) in the country. Over the past two years, national Russian language specialized schools and Russian language departments (groups) of various universities have cultivated a considerable number of Russian language cadres for the country. Various schools have successively established teaching and research sections, initially formulated teaching plans and syllabi, and paid attention to the work of cultivating teachers. Teaching work has gradually become standardized, changing the previous blitz training method.
    The Second National Russian Language Teaching Conference reviewed the Russian language teaching work of the past two years, believing that the direction and tasks of past Russian language teaching work were not clear enough; the teaching plans and syllabi were not unified; the number of teachers was small, and their quality was low; and there was a lack of suitable unified teaching materials. Based on the actual requirements of national construction tasks and the specific conditions of various schools, the conference determined that the task of Russian language specialized schools is to cultivate translation talents and middle school teachers, with a general schooling period of three years. The task of university Russian language departments (groups) is to cultivate middle school teachers, with a general schooling period of three or four years. Russian specialized schools and university Russian language departments (groups) with the necessary conditions should establish graduate classes to cultivate higher education teachers and translation cadres of higher quality, with a study period of one or two years. The task of Russian language courses in higher education institutions is to cultivate students' ability to preliminarily read Russian books in their respective majors. Russian language courses in various higher education institutions should be offered according to possible conditions.
    According to the above policy, the Russian Language Teaching Conference studied the teaching plans and syllabi of Russian language specialized schools and university Russian language departments (groups), believing that the professional courses currently taught in various Russian language specialized schools should be gradually discontinued to concentrate efforts on doing a good job in the teaching of basic Russian (except for schools run by various professional departments with special tasks), but students should also learn a certain amount of scientific and technical vocabulary. Various Russian language specialized schools and university Russian language departments (groups) should offer Chinese language and physical education courses.
    The Russian Language Teaching Conference emphasized the importance of cultivating new Russian language teachers and improving the quality of existing Russian language teachers, believing that students in teacher training classes should be students with excellent character and learning, and the idea that students are unwilling to become teachers is wrong. This conference also studied the issue of "accelerated Russian language teaching," believing that many specific methods of "accelerated teaching" still need to be further studied. Its main feature is to concentrate the main vocabulary and grammar for breakthroughs, but the breakthrough points must be continuously consolidated and comprehensively popularized. Schools with special tasks must adopt "accelerated" methods to train a group of cadres who have a slight understanding of Russian in a short period of time. However, regular Russian language specialized schools, university Russian language departments (groups), and Russian language courses in higher education institutions have a longer study period and should not generally adopt the "accelerated teaching" method.

    中央人民政府高等教育部
    召开第二次全国俄文教学工作会议
    确定了全国俄文专科学校和大学俄文系的教学方针任务
    中央人民政府高等教育部八月间召开了第二次全国俄文教学工作会议，确定了全国俄文专科学校和大学俄文系的教学工作的方针和任务。
    随着国家建设事业的进展，全国俄文学校有很大发展。现在全国有七所正规的俄文专科学校，有十所大学设有俄文系（组）。两年多来，全国俄文专科学校和各大学俄文系（组）已为国家培养了不少俄文干部。各校先后成立了教研室，初步制定了教学计划和教学大纲，并注意了培养师资的工作，教学工作逐渐走上正规，改变了过去突击训练的方式。
    第二次全国俄文教学会议检查了两年来俄文教学工作，认为过去俄文教学工作的方针、任务不够明确；教学计划、教学大纲不统一；师资数量少，质量低；缺少适用的统一的教材。会议根据国家建设任务的实际要求和各校具体条件，确定了俄文专科学校的任务是培养翻译人才和中等学校师资，学制一般为三年。大学俄文系（组）的任务是培养中等学校师资，学制一般为三年或四年。有条件的俄专和大学俄文系（组）应设立研究生班，培养高等学校师资和质量较高的翻译干部，学习时间一年或二年。高等学校俄文课的任务是培养学生初步阅读所学专业的俄文书籍。各高等学校的俄文课，应根据可能条件开设。
    根据上述方针，俄文教学会议研究了俄文专科学校和大学俄文系（组）的教学计划和教学大纲的问题，认为各俄文专科学校现在所讲授的专业课应逐步停授，以集中力量作好基础俄语的教学（各专业部门所办的有特殊任务的学校例外），但也要使学生学到一定的科学技术词汇。各俄文专科学校和大学俄文系（组）应设中国语文课和体育课。
    俄文教学会议强调指出培养新的俄文师资和提高现有俄文师资的质量的重要性，认为师资班的学生应该是品学兼优的学生，学生不愿当教师的思想是错误的。这次会议对“俄文速成教学”问题也作了研究，认为“速成教学”很多具体方法尚需继续研究，它的主要特点是把主要的词汇和语法集中起来突破，但突破一点必须继续巩固，普及全面。负有特殊任务的学校要在短时期内培养出一批略懂俄文的干部，不得不采取“速成”办法。但正规的俄文专科学校，大学俄文系（组）和高等学校俄文课有较长的学习时间，不宜普遍采用“速成教学”的方式。
