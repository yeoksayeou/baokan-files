    [Reported by this newspaper] The Industry Department of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened mobilization rallies for the production increase and thrift campaign on August 26th, respectively.
    Wang Xinghua, the head of the Industry Department of the Harbin Municipal Committee, clearly pointed out the guidelines for the production increase and thrift campaign at a factory cadre meeting. He said: "Each enterprise must, based on last year's experience in increasing production and practicing thrift and the enterprise's production and sales situation, put forward its own requirements for increasing production and practicing thrift." That is, "For products of good quality that are in short supply because they are needed for national construction and people's lives, efforts should be made to fully exploit the enterprise's potential, increase production, and overfulfill or complete plans ahead of schedule on the basis of consolidating and improving quality (each enterprise's production increase and thrift plan should be submitted to the higher-level department in charge for approval). For products that currently have sales problems and whose quality and specifications do not meet the needs of national construction and the people, efforts should be concentrated on improving quality and completing trial production plans for new products in order to open up market sales, and the phenomenon of blindly increasing production should be resolutely avoided. All enterprises should pay attention to reducing costs, opposing waste, and breaking through the state's technical and economic norms to create and save more wealth for the country."
    In terms of methods, each enterprise should start by summarizing the implementation of the plan for the first eight months, and the factory leading cadres should report to all employees to let them know the completion of the 1953 state plan of the enterprise, the existing problems, and the direction of future efforts, publicize the great significance of carrying out the production increase and thrift campaign to the employees, point out the direction of production increase and thrift for the enterprise, put forward the specific goals for the whole factory to strive for before the end of the year in production increase and thrift; and call on all employees to check the completion of the plan for the first eight months by work section and group, continue to find tricks, revise and supplement the action plan of the work section and group, put forward the specific goals for production increase and thrift before the end of the year, and launch a competition after discussion. The purpose of the competition is to comprehensively and balancedly overfulfill the production plan; in addition to the general requirements of completing quality, quantity, safety, balance, and complying with labor discipline, the content of the competition should also be based on the different situations of enterprises to carry out competitions aimed at solving key production problems. In order to effectively achieve the purpose of increasing production and practicing thrift and creating wealth for the country, it is necessary to do a good job in plan management, technical management, promotion of advanced experience, implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts, safe production, and consolidation of labor discipline.
    At the Benxi City Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Mobilization Rally, Xu Hongwen, the acting manager of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, put forward specific requirements for production increase and thrift to its subordinate units: In terms of basic construction, it is necessary to implement the responsibility system for construction, technology, and inspection, and formulate and implement construction operation regulations; in addition to requiring completion on schedule or ahead of schedule, civil construction projects should reduce costs by 3% in general; open-pit mining projects should also complete tasks ten days ahead of schedule and reduce costs by 5%. In terms of production, the main products such as steelmaking should overfulfill the annual plan by 1.5%; pig iron should overfulfill the annual plan by 1.03%; concentrate powder should overfulfill the annual plan by 11.5%; sintering should overfulfill the annual plan by 13.5%; and coke should overfulfill the annual plan by 3.6%. The responsible cadres of the Benxi City Federation of Trade Unions called on cadres of various units at the meeting to conscientiously study relevant documents, recognize the important significance of carrying out the production increase and thrift campaign, and then formulate a production increase and thrift plan according to the requirements of the higher authorities and the specific situation of the unit. Office personnel should closely integrate with the workers and masses to jointly carry out the production increase and thrift campaign.
    The meeting emphasized that the focus of carrying out the production increase and thrift campaign should be determined after serious discussion based on the production and sales situation. For products that are not widely sold and of poor quality, efforts should be concentrated on improving quality, and the tendency to blindly increase production should be opposed.
    Furthermore, after the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized factories and mines throughout the city to carry out the production increase and thrift campaign, the General Branch Committee of the Shenyang No. 6 Machinery Plant of the Chinese Communist Party immediately convened a meeting, clearly pointed out the consistency between the production increase and thrift campaign and the central work, and reviewed the implementation of the plan in the first half of the year. The inspection revealed many problems. For example, the operation plan was inaccurate and incomplete, the dispatching work was unsound, the equipment maintenance and upkeep work was poor, and the intermittent working hours in the first half of the year reached 36,022 hours, which was equivalent to producing 212 fewer standard water pumps, resulting in a loss of 3.64 billion yuan of wealth; due to lax labor discipline and more defective products, the operation plan was also seriously disrupted. Therefore, it was decided to further consolidate labor discipline and improve product quality. The leading cadres put forward the slogan "The central link of carrying out the production increase and thrift movement is to comprehensively and balancedly implement the operation plan and reduce defective products" to all employees.
    Then, the factory held a general meeting of all employees for comprehensive mobilization, and held a production increase and thrift exhibition, organized employees to visit, and improved employees' confidence. The lathe operators of the shaft group of the fourth workshop, due to learning the Kolesov new tool method, guaranteed to complete the 1953 state plan three months ahead of schedule; the vast majority of office personnel actively went deep into the workshop, striving to contribute more to the production increase and thrift campaign, so as to overfulfill the state plan more.

    哈尔滨、本溪举行动员大会
    开展增产节约竞赛运动
    沈阳机械六厂职工保证超额完成国家计划
    【本报讯】中共哈尔滨市委会工业部、中共本溪市委会在八月二十六日分别召开了增产节约竞赛动员大会。
    哈尔滨市委工业部部长王兴华在工厂干部大会上，明确指出了增产节约竞赛的方针。他说：各个企业必须根据去年增产节约经验和本企业的产销情况，提出自己的增产节约的要求。即“凡产品质量好，为国家建设和人民生活需要而又供不应求者，应在巩固和提高质量的基础上，充分发挥企业的潜力，增加生产，超额或提前完成计划（各企业的增产节约计划应呈报上级主管部局批准）。凡目前产品销路有问题，质量规格不适应国家建设和人民需要者，应集中力量提高质量，完成新产品试制计划，以打开市场的销路，坚决避免发生盲目增产的现象。所有企业都应注意降低成本，反对浪费，突破国家的技术经济定额，给国家创造和节约更多的财富”。
    在作法上，各企业应从总结上八个月计划执行情况入手，由厂领导干部向全体职工做报告，使职工知道本企业一九五三年国家计划完成的情况、存在的问题及今后努力方向，向职工宣传开展增产节约竞赛的重大意义，指出本企业增产节约的方向，提出全厂年前增产节约的具体奋斗目标；号召全体职工按工段，小组检查上八个月计划完成的情况，继续找窍门，修订和补充本工段、小组的行动计划，提出年前增产节约的具体奋斗目标，在讨论后展开竞赛。竞赛的目的是为了全面均衡地超额完成生产计划；竞赛的内容除一般应有完成质量、数量、安全、均衡和遵守劳动纪律等要求外，还应按不同企业情况展开以解决生产关键问题为内容的竞赛。为了能切实地达到增产节约，给国家创造财富的目的，必须把计划管理、技术管理、推广先进经验、贯彻苏联专家建议、安全生产和巩固劳动纪律的工作做好。
    在本溪市增产节约竞赛动员大会上，本溪钢铁公司代经理徐宏文对所属各单位提出了增产节约的具体要求：在基本建设方面，要贯彻施工、技术、检查等责任制，制订和贯彻施工操作规程；土木建筑各工程除要求按期或提前完工外，在总的方面要求降低成本百分之三；露天矿工程也要求提前十天完成任务，并降低成本百分之五。在生产方面，主要产品如制钢要求超额完成全年计划百分之一点五；生铁超额完成全年计划百分之一点零三；精选粉超额完成全年计划百分之十一点五；烧结超额完成全年计划百分之十三点五；焦炭超额完成全年计划百分之三点六等。本溪市总工会负责干部在会上号召各单位干部认真学习有关文件，认清开展增产节约竞赛的重要意义，然后根据上级要求和本单位的具体情况，制订出增产节约计划。科室人员与工人群众要密切结合，共同开展增产节约竞赛。
    会议强调指出：开展增产节约竞赛的重点，应根据产销情况认真经过讨论来确定，凡是产品销路不广、质量不好的，应集中力量提高质量，反对盲目增产的偏向。
    又讯：中共沈阳市委员会动员全市厂矿开展增产节约竞赛以后，中共沈阳机械六厂总支委员会立即召开会议，明确指出增产节约竞赛与中心工作的一致性，并检查了上半年执行计划的情况。通过检查暴露了不少问题。如作业计划不准确、不全面，调度工作不健全，设备检修与保养工作差，上半年间断工时达三万六千零二十二小时，等于少生产了二百一十二台标准水泵，损失了三十六亿四千多万元的财富；由于劳动纪律松懈，废品多，也严重地打乱了作业计划。因此决定进一步巩固劳动纪律，提高产品质量。领导干部向全体职工提出了“开展增产节约运动的中心环节是全面、均衡地贯彻作业计划，压缩废品”的口号。
    接着该厂召开了全厂职工大会进行全面动员，并举办了增产节约展览会，组织职工参观，提高了职工的信心。四车间轴组的车工们由于学习了科列索夫新车刀法，保证提前三个月完成一九五三年国家计划；绝大多数科室人员都积极深入车间，争取在增产节约竞赛中多贡献一分力量，以便更多地超额完成国家计划。
