In the first year of the planned economic construction by the state, the capital market is becoming increasingly prosperous. According to the seasonal pattern in the past, the first and second quarters of the year were the off-season, and business conditions gradually improved entering July and August. However, this year's situation has changed this pattern, presenting a strong performance in the off-season.

The total turnover of social commodities in the capital market in the first half of this year increased by 97% compared to the first half of last year; it has continued to rise since July and August. Looking at the turnover of commodities in state-owned trade, August increased by 8.24% compared to July and increased by 77.3% compared to August last year. The turnover of cooperative commodities also increased, with August increasing by 31.7% compared to July and increasing by approximately 42% compared to August last year.

With the improvement of people's purchasing power, people's needs for goods have also undergone great changes. For example, the requirements for the specifications, quality, style, novelty, taste, and nutrition of goods have also increased. This can be fully proven from the market trading situation. For example, according to the transaction statistics of the Beijing Yarn and Cloth Exchange, in the first and second quarters of this year, higher quality fabrics, such as worsted wool, Paramount, and khaki, accounted for 25.26% of the total transaction volume of various fabrics, while the same period in 1951 only accounted for 9.38%. In terms of meat, the sales volume of pork in the first half of this year increased by 54% compared to the same period last year and increased by 69.49% compared to the same period in 1951. The sales volume of mutton has also increased significantly, with the first half of this year increasing by 61.2% compared to the same period last year and increasing by more than 95% compared to the same period in 1951.

In the continuous improvement and changes in people's needs, the state-owned trade departments have made great efforts to ensure the supply of materials to the capital and the stability of market prices. For example, from January to August this year, the total turnover of state-owned trade commodities increased by approximately 1.1 times compared to January to August last year. Among them, the grain company has worked hard to adjust various grain varieties and appropriately increased the proportion of fine grain supply. The cotton yarn and cloth company has increased the supply of fancy fabrics. From January to August this year, the various fancy fabrics and colored fabrics supplied reached 71.36% of the total supply, while white fabrics accounted for 28.64%. In the same period in 1951, white fabrics still accounted for 49% of the supply.

The increase in the supply of several daily necessities also shows the improvement of people's purchasing power. For example, the number of watches supplied by the Beijing branch of the China Department Store Company increased by 69.7% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. The supply of bicycles from January to August this year increased by 217% compared to the same period last year. The number of various fruits supplied by the Beijing branch of the China Native Produce Company increased by 240.6% from January to August this year compared to the same period last year, and fish increased by 207.4%. Although state-owned businesses have paid attention to large-scale supply, some commodities still cannot keep up with the development of people's needs. For example, finished uniforms with new styles and good quality, various fabrics with good quality and new patterns, beautiful leather shoes, and some other high-quality daily necessities are still felt to be insufficient. In the customer opinion book of the Wangfujing branch of the Beijing Company, there are many opinions from customers because they cannot buy satisfactory products due to the incomplete variety.

Currently, various state-owned trading companies and cooperatives are actively developing sources of goods. In addition to organizing and preparing for the production and supply of autumn and winter goods, they are also vigorously organizing urban-rural exchanges. The Beijing Cooperative Business Organization Conference has ended. Now the relevant state-owned companies and cooperatives are participating in the North China exchange meeting held in Tianjin to promote the down-to-the-countryside flow of industrial and handicraft products. At the same time, the state-owned commercial departments in Beijing are expanding commodity circulation, increasing the variety of commodities, further strengthening business management, and reducing commodity costs on the basis of the work done in the first half of the year, in order to supply the people with inexpensive and high-quality commodities.

### 首都市场今年日益繁荣出现淡季不淡景象  上半年商品流转总额比去年增加近一倍

    首都市场今年日益繁荣出现淡季不淡景象
    上半年商品流转总额比去年增加近一倍
    在国家有计划的经济建设开始的第一年，首都市场日益繁荣。按过去的季节规律来说，上半年的一、二季度是淡季，进入七、八月份，营业情况才逐渐好转。但今年的情况改变了这一规律，呈现了淡季不淡的景象。
    今年上半年首都市场的社会商品流转总额比去年上半年增加百分之九十七；七、八月份以来又不断上升。以国营贸易的商品流转额来看，八月份比七月份增加百分之八点二四，比去年八月增加百分之七十七点三。合作社商品流转额亦有增加，八月份比七月份增加百分之三十一点七，比去年八月增加约百分之四十二。
    随着人民购买力的提高，人民对商品的需要也发生了很大的变化。比如对商品的规格质量、式样新旧以及味道营养等的要求也日益提高了。这可以从市场交易的情况充分得到证明。如北京市纱布交易所的成交统计，今年一、二季度中较高质料的布匹，如华达呢、派拉蒙、卡其等占到各种布匹总成交量的百分之二十五点二六，一九五一年同时期仅占到百分之九点三八。在肉食方面，今年上半年猪肉销售量比去年同时期增加了百分之五十四，比一九五一年同时期增加百分之六十九点四九。羊肉的销售量也有很大增加，今年上半年比去年同时期增加百分之六十一点二，比一九五一年同时期增加达百分之九十五以上。
    在人民需要的不断提高和变化中，国营贸易部门作了很大的努力，保证了对首都的物资供应和市场物价的稳定。比如今年一月至八月国营贸易的商品流转总额比去年一月至八月增加了约一点一倍，其中粮食公司曾努力调剂了各种粮种，适当地增加了细粮的供应比重。花纱布公司增加了花色布的供应，今年一月至八月所供应的各种花布、色布，达到供应总量的百分之七十一点三六，白布占百分之二十八点六四。而一九五一年同时期白布还占到供应量的百分之四十九。
    从几种日用品的供应量也可看出人民购买力的提高。如中国百货公司北京市公司所供应的手表，今年第二季度比第一季度增加了百分之六十九点七。今年一月份至八月份自行车的供应量比去年同时期增加百分之二百一十七。中国土产公司北京市公司供应的各种水果的数量，今年一月份至八月份比去年同时期增加了百分之二百四十点六，鱼类增加百分之二百零七点四。虽然国营商业注意了大量供应，但有些商品还是赶不上人民的需要的发展。比如式样新、质料好的制服成品，质料好的新花色的各样布匹，漂亮的皮鞋，以及其他一些质量较高的日用品，还是感到不足的。北京市公司王府井门市部的顾客意见簿上，就有很多是属于顾客因为品种不全买不到称心的用品而提出的意见。
    目前各国营贸易公司和合作社正在积极地开辟货源，除组织准备对秋冬货的生产与供应外，并在大力组织城乡交流工作。北京市合作社业务组织会议已经结束。现在有关国营公司和合作社正在参加华北在天津举行的交流会议，以促使工业品和手工业品的下乡。现在北京市的国营商业部门正在上半年工作的基础上，开展增产节约运动，以扩大商品流转，增加商品品种，进一步加强经营管理工作，降低商品成本，以供应人民价廉物美的商品。
