    The Soviet Union and International Trade
    Nesterov, Chairman of the Soviet Chamber of Commerce

    I.
    Increasing trade relations with all countries—including those in the capitalist world—is the unwavering policy of the Soviet government.

    Recent examples of this policy include the business agreements signed between the Soviet Union and several capitalist countries, including trade agreements with France, Finland, Iran, Denmark, Greece, Norway, Sweden, Argentina, and Iceland, and payment agreements with Egypt. Furthermore, negotiations for trade agreements are proceeding smoothly with other countries.

    The nature and content of these trade agreements demonstrate that they are based on mutual benefit and equality between the contracting parties. In the current situation, trade agreements without harsh obligations and political conditions are of great importance to many Western countries. The provisions in trade agreements with the Soviet Union regarding payment arrangements are of great value to capitalist countries experiencing foreign exchange shortages.

    The development of trade between the Soviet Union and Finland is a good illustration. The economic relations between the two countries are based on the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance concluded five years ago. The desire of both governments to strengthen and develop these relations is embodied in the five-year (1951-1955) exchange of goods agreement signed in 1950, supplemented by a four-year trade agreement from 1952 to 1955. Since then, Soviet-Finnish trade has continuously increased. The trade volume in 1951, calculated at comparable prices, increased ninefold compared to 1938, and in 1953 it will almost double that of 1952. The agreement signed on February 23 this year expanded the scope of exchange and provided Finland with more opportunities to obtain needed goods. The development of trade with the Soviet Union enables Finland to maintain domestic employment levels and solve supply and foreign exchange problems. If Finland were to purchase the same goods from capitalist countries, it would have to draw on a large amount of foreign exchange from its limited reserves. On the other hand, the substantial amount of goods that Finland sells to the Soviet Union is now difficult to market in other countries. The multilateral agreements concluded between Finland and the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are also an important factor in Finland's foreign trade, making it easier for Finland to expand the sale of products and obtain needed goods.

    Another example is the development of trade relations between the Soviet Union and Iran based on the 1940 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The one-year agreement that came into effect in June this year stipulates an increase in the quantity of barter trade. Iran expressed great satisfaction with the signing of the agreement and its favorable terms. Iranian newspapers emphasized that Soviet-Iranian trade relations are based on mutual benefit, mutual respect, equality, and friendly cooperation.

    As is well known, not all countries are able to adhere to these principles with other countries, especially Iran. Some countries exploit Iran's economic difficulties to force it to accept harsh trade terms, further worsening Iran's financial and economic situation. Trade with the Soviet Union, on the other hand, is very beneficial to Iran. Iranian newspapers estimate that the new barter agreement will save Iran foreign exchange worth 11.1 billion rials (Iranian currency) per year.

    As is known, the Soviet Union signed a trade agreement and a payment agreement with France on July 15, 1953. The trade agreement has a term of three years, with each party exporting goods worth nearly 12 billion francs in the first year. According to the agreement, the Soviet Union will supply France with corn, anthracite, asbestos, asphalt, chromium ore, manganese ore, oil, etc., and France will export rayon and rayon fabrics, woolen fabrics, coffee beans, lead, citrus fruits, vanilla extract, etc. In addition, in the second and third years, France will build 5,000-ton merchant ships, transportation equipment, and boilers for the Soviet Union. Transactions will be settled in francs.

    The trade and payment agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Argentina on August 5, 1953, stipulates that the Soviet Union will supply Argentina with oil, coal, and equipment for the petroleum, coal mining, and electric power industries, railway equipment, tractors, and agricultural machinery, etc. These materials, especially machinery and equipment, are of great significance for Argentina's economic development. Because the United States has consistently refused to supply Argentina and other Latin American countries with the equipment urgently needed for industrial development. More than half of the goods that Argentina will export to the Soviet Union in the first year will be linseed oil and wool.

    Each of the above agreements has become the subject of extensive commentary in foreign newspapers. Western countries warmly welcome the expansion of trade relations with the Soviet Union. This is not only due to obvious economic benefits; foreign public opinion has not ignored the very important fact that every new progress in trade relations with the Soviet Union will help normalize international trade and improve the overall international situation. For example, the French newspaper "Liberation" pointed out that the Soviet-French agreement guarantees "that French heavy industry can obtain a large amount of necessary raw materials such as chromium, manganese, and asbestos, which we have always been forced to buy from the United States at high prices and pay in dollars. It should be pointed out that some of these commodities are listed as 'strategic materials' by the US Battle Act. Thus, the materials that the Soviet Union will supply us are what the United States forbids us to export to the Soviet Union! This convinces us how unreasonable some of the discriminatory measures imposed on our foreign trade are."

    The press of American monopoly capital has launched vicious attacks on every trade agreement signed with the Soviet Union. Washington's "psychological warfare" strategists even regard the Soviet Union's efforts to develop normal trade relations as a "threat to the Western world," but in this regard, American propaganda is more ineffective than ever, because Western countries are striving to restore normal trade with the Soviet Union and other countries in the democratic camp after extremely careful consideration.

    II.
    As a result of some capitalist countries' economies being turned to war service, trade in some commodities of vital importance to the peaceful economy has declined sharply. The militarization of the economy has disrupted commercial relations in the capitalist world, causing trade to decline and making it more parasitic and military-oriented. The plunder of some countries by others has also become more intense and cruel. Due to the shrinking of the market, it is more difficult to find markets for goods, thus intensifying the contradictions between capitalist countries.

    The difficulties encountered by the capitalist world in trade are mainly due to the insatiable greed of American monopoly capital. The principle underlying the US foreign trade policy is to exert pressure on competitors and seize their markets, control world raw materials, and monopolize investment areas.

    As a result of this expansionist policy of the United States, the percentage of American monopoly capital in the total export trade of major capitalist countries has greatly increased. For example, in 1952, the United States accounted for 20.5 percent of the total, while in 1937 it was 14 percent. The reason why the United States has been able to do this is because it has seized the markets of Germany, Japan, and Italy and driven Britain, France, and other countries out of their original markets. American monopoly capital also expands export trade with the help of government subsidies and dumping policies, and under the guise of "aid," it invades the markets of its "allies" and vassal states, eliminates opponents, and undermines the economies of other capitalist countries.

    The United States' trade surplus has reached an unprecedented level in history. From 1946 to 1952, the United States exported goods and services worth US$123 billion, while imports during the same period did not exceed US$78 billion. This one-sided trade is a source of huge profits for a small group of American monopolists. But as a result, not only because it has drained the gold and foreign exchange of Western European countries and thus undermined their economies, but also because it has led the US trade policy itself into a dead end. In the six years from 1946 to 1952, the trade deficit of capitalist countries with the United States, even after allocating US$13 billion worth of gold and foreign exchange to compensate, still reached US$32 billion.

    The huge long-term trade deficit of Western European countries is the main reason for their increasing economic difficulties. In 1952 alone, as a result of artificial dependence on the United States, the dollar gap of Western European countries reached US$2.43 billion.

    Latin America had a trade surplus of US$990 million in 1950, but in 1952, it had a trade deficit of US$720 million. Asia and Oceania had a trade surplus of US$1.36 billion in 1950, but in 1952, they owed the United States US$2.001 billion. Africa has not escaped this common fate, and by the end of 1952, it had a trade deficit of US$1.49 billion.

    This huge trade deficit has almost exhausted the gold and foreign exchange reserves of most capitalist countries. The severe and prolonged foreign exchange crisis is undermining the economies of some capitalist countries, especially those that cannot survive without expanding foreign trade, such as Britain. The unfavorable situation in the trade balance of Italy, France, and other countries is also unprecedented.

    While expanding export trade, American monopoly capital uses tariff barriers to prevent the import of foreign goods in order to dominate the entire capitalist world market.

    In the post-war years, American monopoly capital has disrupted the traditional trade relations between capitalist countries and controlled most of the markets in Western Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. For example, in the total export trade of major capitalist countries to Western Europe, the United States accounted for 42 percent in 1952, while it accounted for only 34 percent in 1937. Latin America accounted for 75 percent and 54 percent respectively during the same period, and Southeast Asia accounted for 34 percent and 25 percent respectively during the same period.

    The American monopoly capital group is pursuing its expansion policy at the expense of its partners, mainly Britain, resulting in a fierce battle for the market. The total value of British exports to Western Europe was only 21 percent less than that of the United States in 1937, but in 1952, it was 53 percent less. In 1952, the total value of American exports to Latin America was nine times that of Britain. In 1937, British exports to Southeast Asia exceeded the United States by 50 percent, but in 1951, the United States exceeded Britain by 18 percent. Britain is waging a tenacious struggle against American expansion, and the competition between Britain and the United States in the markets of Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the Near East, and Britain's dominions Australia and New Zealand is becoming increasingly fierce.

    III.
    The world trade situation has become increasingly unbearable for many capitalist countries, especially Western European countries. The protests against the US manipulation of international trade are getting louder and louder in political and business circles. At the same time, they demand unimpeded trade between the East and the West.

    Over the past two years, the necessity of normalizing international trade has become a topic frequently discussed in newspapers with various tendencies, and a topic that is debated more and more in the parliaments of many countries.

    The International Economic Conference held in Moscow in April 1952 greatly promoted the widespread discussion of this issue. The Moscow Conference proved that opportunities for restoring and developing normal international trade do exist. The conference convinced participants that different economic and social systems should not be an obstacle to promoting mutually beneficial trade and peaceful economic cooperation between countries.

    From April 13 to 25, 1953, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe held the East-West European Trade Conference in Geneva, and from May 18 to 23, the 14th Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce was held in Vienna. Both conferences discussed world trade issues. From the discussions of these two conferences, we can see the significant differences between the United States and other countries in the capitalist world, especially Western European countries, on international trade issues.

    Commenting on the results of the aforementioned Geneva conference at a press conference, Gunnar Myrdal, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, said that the conference had achieved good results and laid the foundation for further consultations and trade development. Western newspapers believe that the achievements of the conference should be attributed to the efforts of the Soviet delegation.

    The 14th Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce, attended by business people from 34 countries, unexpectedly changed direction, although it initially stipulated "unified Europe" and other agendas that made it easier for American goods to invade the Western European market. Western European business representatives loudly protested against the various restrictions imposed on international trade and the shrinking of foreign markets. They openly stated that they could not support proposals that were solely determined by the profits of American monopoly capital groups. What was particularly significant in the debate was the repeated mention of the need to expand East-West trade.

    Commenting on the desire of Western European countries to expand trade with the East, "US News & World Report" estimated that the current amount of imports from the democratic and socialist camp by Western European countries is only about a quarter of the pre-war level. The publication said: "If these imports can be increased to even half of the pre-war level, the trade deficit of Western Europe with the dollar area can be greatly reduced - possibly by a third." This article deliberately does not mention that even if trade between East and West only returns to the pre-war level, it will greatly alleviate the economic difficulties of Western European countries, reduce unemployment, and so on. However, Western business people and Western newspapers who demand the normalization of international trade are increasingly mentioning the benefits of restoring East-West trade. Some far-sighted businessmen in Western Europe and other capitalist countries are beginning to realize the necessity of an independent trade policy that is not influenced by American monopoly capital, and the necessity of developing trade with all countries, regardless of social system.

    The Soviet Union has provided ample proof of its sincere desire to promote international trade. The Soviet Union's policy is to steadfastly safeguard and consolidate peace, cooperate with all countries, and develop trade relations on the basis of respecting the interests of both parties. There is no doubt that reality will increasingly force capitalist countries to restore and expand trade with the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union.

    苏联和国际贸易
    苏联商会主席　涅斯捷罗夫
    一
    增进和各国——包括资本主义世界各国在内——的贸易关系，是苏联政府坚定不移的政策。
    关于这一政策的最近例证是苏联和一些资本主义国家签订了商务性的协定，包括同法国、芬兰、伊朗、丹麦、希腊、挪威、瑞典、阿根廷和冰岛的贸易协定，同埃及的支付协定。另外还同其他国家顺利地进行着缔结贸易协定的谈判。
    这些贸易协定的性质和内容都说明协定是以缔约双方互利和平等为基础的。在目前情形下，对于许多西方国家来说，不附带苛刻义务和政治条件的贸易协定是十分重要的。和苏联签订的贸易协定中所规定的有关支付的处理，对感受外汇短缺的资本主义国家来说，有很大的价值。
    苏联和芬兰间的贸易发展的情况就是一个很好的说明。两国经济关系是以五年前缔结的友好、合作和互助条约为基础的。双方政府加强和发展这些关系的愿望体现在一九五○年签订的为期五年（一九五一到一九五五年）的换货协定中，此后又辅以从一九五二到一九五五年的为期四年的贸易协定。苏芬贸易此后即不断增加。一九五一年的贸易额以比较价格计算较一九三八年增加九倍，一九五三年差不多将增为一九五二年的两倍。今年二月二十三日签订的协定，扩大了换货范围，为芬兰提供了更多的机会获得所需的货物。对苏贸易的发展，使芬兰能够保持国内就业水平并能解决供应和外汇等问题。如果芬兰向资本主义国家购买相同的货物，它就不得不从有限的储备中动用大量的外汇。另一方面，芬兰售给苏联的数量颇大的货物现在在其他国家内是不易找到市场的。芬兰和苏联及人民民主国家间缔结的多边协定，也是芬兰对外贸易中一个重要的因素，这使芬兰更加容易地扩大销售产品和得到所需的货物。
    另一例证是苏联根据一九四○年通商航海条约发展和伊朗的贸易关系。今年六月起生效的为期一年的协定，规定增加易货数量。伊朗对协定的签订及其优厚条款深表满意。伊朗报纸强调指出：苏伊贸易关系是建立于互利、互相尊重、平等和友好合作的基础之上的。
    如所周知，并不是所有国家对其他国家，特别是对伊朗，能够遵守这些原则的。有些国家利用伊朗的经济困难强迫它接受苛刻的贸易条款，使伊朗财政和经济情况更为恶化。而同苏联进行贸易，则对伊朗大有好处。伊朗报纸估计，新换货协定将使伊朗一年中节约价值达十一亿一千万里阿尔斯（伊朗币）的外汇。
    一九五三年七月十五日，苏联同法国签订了一项贸易协定和一项支付协定。贸易协定的期限为三年，在第一年内双方各自输出货物近一百二十亿法郎。根据协定，苏联将供给法国玉蜀黍、无烟煤、石绵、沥青、铬矿、锰矿、石油等，法国将输出人造丝及人造丝织品、毛织品、咖啡豆、铅、柑橘、香草精等。此外，在第二年和第三年，法国将为苏联建造五千吨的商船以及运输器材和汽锅。双方交易将以法郎结算。
    苏联和阿根廷于一九五三年八月五日签订的贸易和支付协定规定，苏联将供给阿根廷石油、煤以及石油工业、采煤工业和电力工业的装备，铁路器材，拖拉机和农业机器等等。这些物资，特别是机器和器材，对阿根廷经济发展具有极其重大的意义。因为美国一向拒绝供给阿根廷及其他拉丁美洲国家工业发展所亟需的各种装备。阿根廷第一年输往苏联的货物中，将有一半以上是亚麻仁油和羊毛。
    上述每一协定都成为外国报纸广泛评论的题目。西方国家热烈欢迎扩展对苏贸易关系。这还不仅仅由于明显的经济利益；国外的舆论并未忽视这样一个十分重要的事实：对苏贸易关系中每一个新的进展都会有助于国际贸易的正常化，并改善整个的国际局势。例如，法国的“解放报”曾指出，苏法协定保证“法国重工业能获得大量必需的原料如铬、锰和石绵等，而这些我们一向是被迫以高价到美国购买并需以美元偿付的。应该指出的是内中有些商品被美国的巴特尔法列为‘战略物资’。这样，苏联将供给我们的物资是美国禁止我们输往苏联的！这就使我们信服，强施于我们对外贸易上的若干歧视性措施是多么无理。”
    美国垄断资本的报刊对每次同苏联签订的贸易协定都发出恶毒的攻击。华盛顿的“心理战”战略家们甚至把苏联这种发展正常贸易关系的努力当作“对西方世界的威胁”，但是在这方面，美国的宣传比以往更无济于事，因为西方国家力求和苏联及民主阵营其他国家恢复正常贸易是经过极为慎重的考虑的。
    二
    一些资本主义国家的经济转为战争服务的结果，使得一些对和平经济至关紧要的商品贸易急剧衰退。经济军事化已经破坏了资本主义世界的商业关系，使贸易衰退，并使之具有更大的寄生性和军事性。一些国家对另外一些国家的掠夺也变得更猛烈和残酷。由于市场的缩小，就更难以找到销货市场，因而使资本主义国家间的矛盾也日益尖锐化了。
    资本主义世界在贸易方面遇到的困难，主要由于美国垄断资本的贪得无厌。美国对外贸易政策依据的原则是：对竞争敌手施以高压并夺取它的市场，控制世界原料，独占投资范围。
    美国的这种扩张政策的结果，使美国垄断资本在主要资本主义国家出口贸易总额中所占的百分比大大增加了，例如，一九五二年美国占总额的百分之二十点五，而一九三七年则为百分之十四。美国所以能够如此，就因为美国夺得了德国、日本和意大利的市场并把英国、法国和其他国家从他们原有市场里驱逐了出去。美国垄断资本扩张出口贸易还借助于政府补贴和倾销政策，并打着“援助”的幌子侵入其“盟国”及附庸国的市场，把对手挤掉，并破坏其他资本主义国家的经济。
    美国的出超达到历史上空前的程度。一九四六年到一九五二年期间，美国出口货物和服务达一千二百三十亿美元，而同期的进口并未超过七百八十亿美元。这种片面的贸易是一小撮美国垄断资本家巨大利润的来源。但其结果，不仅仅因为榨干了西欧国家黄金和外汇因而破坏了它们的经济，而且也使得美国贸易政策本身走上绝路。从一九四六年到一九五二年的六年中，资本主义国家对美贸易的逆差，即使已拨出价值一百三十亿美元的黄金和外汇来弥补，仍达三百二十亿美元。
    西欧国家巨大的长期贸易逆差就是它们经济困难日增的主要原因。仅一九五二年一年，由于人为的对美国的依赖的结果，西欧国家的美元差额就达到二十四亿三千万美元。
    拉丁美洲在一九五○年贸易顺差达九亿九千万美元，但一九五二年则为入超七亿二千万美元。亚洲和大洋洲一九五○年出超为十三亿六千万美元，但在一九五二年则对美负债达二十亿零一千万美元。非洲也未能逃脱这一共同的命运，到一九五二年年底，入超达十四亿九千万美元。
    这种巨大的贸易逆差几乎已经耗尽了大多数资本主义国家黄金和外汇的储备。严重而延续的外汇危机正瓦解着一些资本主义国家的经济，特别是一些不扩展对外贸易就不能生存下去的国家，如英国更是如此。意大利、法国及其他国家在贸易平衡上的不利情况也都是前所未有的。
    美国垄断资本一面扩张出口贸易，一面用关税壁垒来阻止外国货物进口，以便独霸整个资本主义世界市场。
    美国垄断资本在战后年代已经破坏了资本主义国家间传统的贸易关系，控制了西欧、拉丁美洲和东南亚大部分的市场。例如，在各主要资本主义国家对西欧的出口贸易总额中，美国在一九五二年占了百分之四十二，而在一九三七年才占到百分之三十四。拉丁美洲同期为百分之七十五和五十四，东南亚同期为百分之三十四和二十五。
    美国垄断资本集团是以牺牲它的伙伴，主要是英国来推行其扩张政策的，结果发生了一场激烈的市场争夺战。英国对西欧出口总值在一九三七年仅少于美国百分之二十一，而在一九五二年则少百分之五十三。美国一九五二年对拉丁美洲出口总值比英国多九倍。一九三七年，英国对东南亚出口超过美国百分之五十，但在一九五一年，美国则超过英国百分之十八。英国正对美国的扩张展开顽强的斗争，而英美在东南亚、中东、近东以及英国的自治领澳大利亚、新西兰的市场上的争夺战也就越来越尖锐了。
    三
    世界贸易情况已使许多资本主义国家，特别是西欧国家，越来越难以忍受。对美国操纵国际贸易的抗议声浪在政界和工商界中越来越高了。他们同时要求不受阻碍地进行东西方的贸易。
    过去两年来，国际贸易正常化的必要性已成为具有各种倾向的报纸经常讨论的题目，成为许多国家议会中越来辩论得越多的主题。
    一九五二年四月在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议，大大促成了这一问题的广泛讨论。莫斯科会议证明，恢复和发展正常国际贸易的机会确实是存在的。会议使得与会者相信，不同的经济和社会制度不应成为国与国间增进互利贸易与和平经济合作的障碍。
    一九五三年四月十三日到二十五日，联合国欧洲经济委员会在日内瓦举行了东西欧贸易会议，五月十八日到二十三日在维也纳举行了国际商会第十四届大会，这两个会议都讨论了世界贸易问题。从这两次会议的讨论中可以看出美国与资本主义世界其他国家，特别是西欧各国，在国际贸易问题上的显著的分歧。
    联合国欧洲经济委员会执行秘书古恩那·密达尔在记者招待会上评论上述日内瓦会议的结果时说，会议获得了良好的效果，并为进一步的商谈和发展贸易打下基础。西方报纸都认为会议所以获得成就应归功于苏联代表的努力。
    三十四个国家的工商界人士参加的国际商会第十四届大会，初期虽然规定了“统一欧洲”等为美国货物更易入侵西欧市场的一些议程，但是会议却出乎意料地转换了方向。西欧商界代表们大声抗议加于国际贸易的种种限制和国外市场的萎缩。他们公开表示不能支持单纯由美国垄断资本集团利润决定的议案。辩论中特别显著的是一再提到扩大东西方贸易的必要性。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”于评论西欧各国扩大与东方的贸易这一愿望时，估计西欧国家目前来自民主与社会主义阵营的进口数量仅及战前约四分之一。这个刊物说：“如果这些进口那怕能够提高到战前的一半，西欧对美元区的贸易逆差就可以大大缩减——可能缩减三分之一。”这篇文章故意不提到，如果东西方间贸易即使只恢复到战前水平，就会大大减轻西欧国家的经济困难，减少失业等等。不过，要求国际贸易正常化的西方工商界人士和西方报刊却日益经常提到恢复东西方贸易的好处了。西欧及其他资本主义国家的一些较有远见的商人，开始认识到不受美国垄断资本影响的独立贸易政策的必要性，和同所有国家，不分社会制度，发展贸易的必要性。
    苏联已为其增进国际贸易的真诚愿望提供了充分的证明。苏联的政策是坚持不懈地维护和巩固和平、和所有国家合作并在尊重双方利益的基础上发展贸易关系。毫无疑问，现实将日益迫使资本主义国家恢复并扩展对以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的贸易。
