Reader Letters Summary

Editor's note: Readers Jing Rongsheng and Yang Ronglin wrote to reflect: After the Huainan Mining Bureau Drilling Team implemented the specialized responsibility system, they did not dare to boldly cultivate cadres, and even opposed the cultivation of cadres to the establishment of the specialized responsibility system. This not only violates the basic spirit of establishing the specialized responsibility system, but also is harmful to the work of cultivating national construction cadres; this is a relatively common problem at present and deserves attention. Now we publish a summary of readers' letters and the opinions of the Basic Construction Department of the Ministry of Fuel Industry on this issue, hoping that other units will also pay attention to preventing and correcting similar phenomena.

The Establishment of the Specialized Responsibility System and the Cultivation of Cadres Should Be Combined

Letters from Readers Jing Rongsheng and Yang Ronglin

Jing Rongsheng and Yang Ronglin of Huainan Mining Bureau wrote: The leading cadres of the Huainan Mining Bureau Drilling Team opposed the cultivation of cadres to the establishment of the specialized responsibility system. When they established the specialized responsibility system, they stipulated that only the captain and the squad leader could control the feeding handle and the lifting handle on the drilling rig; the rest of the drillers were not allowed to hold the handle, but only did work such as going on the platform and moving drill rods. Therefore, the drillers' urgent need to learn operating skills was not met, and their ideological emotions fluctuated. However, the leadership did not pay attention to and promptly study and solve this problem. The students who graduated from the Drilling Team of the Cadre School of the Ministry of Fuel Industry have initially possessed a certain theoretical and technical foundation and the determination to serve the motherland's drilling cause after four months of theoretical study and two months of drilling room operation practice; after another six months of practice, they can generally be promoted to captain or technician. However, when they went to Huainan Mining Bureau for internship, they did not get the opportunity to hold the handle. Most of them were assigned to work in geology and administrative management. After repeated requests, one person was assigned to the drilling rig, and he still only did sweeping and going on the platform. How can this achieve the purpose of internship?

The practice of the leading cadres of the Huainan Mining Bureau Drilling Team to oppose the establishment of the specialized responsibility system and the cultivation of drilling talents is wrong. Before the establishment of the specialized responsibility system, the drilling work efficiency was low, the quality was poor, and there were many accidents, which is a fact. However, to overcome these shortcomings, the leadership should pay more attention to the political education of workers and improve the technical level of ordinary drillers in a planned way. Especially in the period of the country's planned economic construction, it is even more wrong to neglect the cultivation of a new generation of drilling technicians for the sake of establishing a specialized responsibility system.

Opinions of the Basic Construction Department of the Ministry of Fuel Industry

The Basic Construction Department of the Ministry of Fuel Industry wrote: The opinions of Comrades Jing Rongsheng and Yang Ronglin are correct. One of the important purposes of establishing the specialized responsibility system is to cultivate technical employees who are proficient in their business, so as to successfully complete the current national construction tasks and prepare conditions for future construction work; and only by actively cultivating and improving the political consciousness and technical level of the working masses can the specialized responsibility system be effectively implemented. Therefore, it is completely wrong for the Huainan Mining Bureau Drilling Team to neglect the cultivation of technical personnel when establishing the specialized responsibility system, and even to oppose the two. This erroneous view and practice also exists in some factories and mines at present.

In coal mine drilling work, there are already some examples of combining the cultivation of cadres and the establishment of the specialized responsibility system. For example, the No. 4 drilling rig of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau Drilling Team cultivated eight deputy squad leaders and more than 20 skilled drillers due to the correct implementation of the "package teaching and learning" method from March to December last year, and at the same time completed the work task.

In April this year, the National Coal Mine Geological Drilling Conference also studied this issue and made the following provisions: (1) When drilling into coal seams, marker layers, and complex formations, the squad leader must personally hold the handle; (2) General normal drilling can be done by the assistant (or deputy squad leader) to control the feeding handle; (3) In order to accelerate the training of drilling technicians, apprentices or interns must be given certain handle holding opportunities, but the squad leader must guide them. This shows that the leading departments such as the Ministry of Fuel Industry attach importance to the cultivation of drilling technicians.

In short, while ensuring work quality, efficiency, and safety, drillers should be given more handle holding time. This means that leaders should not only be responsible for the project, but also be responsible for cultivating technical talents.

The Low Quality of the Runheji Sluice Project

The Huai River Governance Committee Should Conduct Inspections

Letters from Readers Rao Shipei and Zhang Zhenhuan: The Huai River Governance Committee built a modern ship lock next to the Runheji diversion sluice. This is beneficial to the material exchange and shipping business in the middle and upper reaches of the Huai River. However, due to the leadership's lack of attention to construction at the Runheji Sluice Headquarters, the quality of the project is very poor. According to incomplete statistics, there are 343 honeycomb holes and 26 exposed steel bars in the entire concrete project. After being washed by river water, some holes have gradually expanded. Between the third and fourth floors of the second gate chamber on the east side, some hollow holes can fit a fist due to the concrete not solidifying.

Due to the lack of planning in the construction, the phenomenon of idling and rework is also very serious. For example, the drainage layer was originally planned to be completed in five to seven days, and the migrant workers were notified in advance to go to the embankment on time; as a result, this project was completed in one month, causing the migrant workers to idle for a whole month. At that time, it was the busy farming season, which directly affected agricultural production. For example, drainage ditches, reservoirs, and other projects were dug and leveled, leveled and dug, reworked again and again, causing great waste.

The workers are dissatisfied with the poor quality of the project and the waste of rework in the construction. They have repeatedly put forward suggestions to the leadership to improve the work. However, the leaders of the Runheji Sluice Headquarters did not adopt the opinions of the masses. When the masses criticized them for not paying attention to the quality of the project in the Huai River Governance Weekly, Zhou Yu, the project commander, also said that the critics were "writing" manuscripts indiscriminately. When the workers reported the problem of poor project quality to Xu Ruifu, the political commissar, Xu Ruifu also used "this is a minor problem" as an excuse to perfunctorily deal with it. Even worse, when the Huai River Governance Committee was about to accept this project, the leaders of the Runheji Sluice Headquarters brushed the inner gate wall with gray water, plastered the outer gate wall with mud, and put one meter deep of water in the gate, attempting to cover up the shortcomings.

We suggest that the Huai River Governance Committee thoroughly inspect the quality of the Runheji Sluice project and the work of the project headquarters, and take necessary measures.

The Newly Built Staff Dormitories of the State-Owned No. 120 Factory

Rework of the Heating Project Wasted 1.2 Billion Yuan

Letters from Readers Liu Xuanbin and Liu Qimin: The quality of the heating project in the staff dormitories built by the State-owned No. 120 Factory last year was poor. Some of them were not usable at all, and the room would freeze in winter. When the rework and repair were carried out this year, serious problems such as the foundation of the underground ditch sinking, the pipeline leaking, the cover plate being crushed, the cloth wrapping the pipeline rotting, the asbestos ash falling off, and the heating colliding with the sewer were found. Therefore, the amount of rework reached 60% of the entire project, causing the country to waste 1.2 billion yuan in rework costs.

The contracting unit (the former Fourth Engineering Department of the Northeast Heavy Industry Department) had many intolerable errors in design and construction. They arbitrarily cut corners and did not construct according to the drawings. For example, more than 400 of the ditch cover plates were made of thin plates with poor pressure resistance, which did not meet the standard at all. 23% of them were crushed during rework. In some places, such as the ditch at the entrance of each house in the family residential area, even such a cover plate was not installed before filling the soil. They also violated the design and construction regulations by passing the heating pipe at the south end of the sixth branch line through the two manholes of the sewer. This not only made the heating unable to flow smoothly, but also affected the quality of the sewer and needed rework. Some ditch walls were built unevenly, not horizontally or vertically, and the width was inappropriate; 90% of the ditch walls were not brushed with asphalt and other moisture-proof layers, so that the cloth wrapped on the pipeline was completely rotten, and a large amount of asbestos ash also fell off, affecting insulation. In addition, the foundation of the ditch concrete was sunken in 32 places and 164 meters, and there were 576 meters of cracks from 3 mm to 15 mm wide. The cement piers of the sliding supports of the trunk pipeline were crushed in 72 places.

We request that the leaders of the former Fourth Engineering Department of the Northeast Heavy Industry Department seriously investigate the responsibility for this problem and take serious measures.

The Suiyuan Provincial Theater Troupe

Chaotic Situation in Reorganization

Letters from Qu Naijian, Wang Xiufang, and Feng Run of the Suiyuan Provincial Theater Troupe: The Suiyuan Provincial Cultural Troupe and the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Cultural Troupe were merged into the Suiyuan Provincial Theater Troupe in June this year. In the reorganization, due to the departmentalism of the leading cadres of the Suiyuan Provincial Cultural Bureau and the Provincial Cultural Troupe, a chaotic situation occurred.

At the beginning of the reorganization, Zhou Dapeng, the person in charge of the Suiyuan Provincial Cultural Bureau, and Shi Daqian, the head of the Provincial Cultural Troupe, did not consider the actual situation and work needs, but only wanted to get more people, and used the words "salary system can be implemented" to encourage the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Cultural Troupe to send more people. As a result, the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Cultural Troupe sent 19 more people than originally stipulated, even the accountant and the band came. The theater troupe's establishment was exceeded, and the higher authorities could not approve it. In addition to setting up a music group to accommodate some personnel, it was necessary to mobilize some personnel to change jobs. Among the four people who changed jobs from the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Cultural Troupe, there was a female comrade who was six months pregnant and suffering from serious heart disease. She was introduced to the North China Administrative Committee Cultural Bureau for job assignment. After arriving in Beijing, the North China Cultural Bureau did not accept her and transferred her back to Suiyuan. Such a long-distance trip is obviously inappropriate.

After the reorganization, some comrades felt ideologically unstable. We hope that the relevant leading departments can quickly deal with it and end the chaotic situation of the theater troupe as soon as possible.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    编者按：读者景荣生、杨荣林来信反映：淮南矿务局钻探队在实行专责制后不敢放手培养干部，甚至把培养干部和建立专责制对立起来。这不但违背了建立专责制的基本精神，而且对于培养国家建设干部的工作是有害的；这是在目前比较普遍而值得注意的一个问题。现在我们把读者来信和中央燃料工业部基本建设司对这个问题的意见摘要发表，希望其他单位也注意防止和纠正类似的现象。
    应该把建立专责制和培养干部结合起来
    读者景荣生、杨荣林的来信
    淮南矿务局景荣生、杨荣林来信：淮南矿务局钻探队领导干部把培养干部和建立专责制对立起来。他们在建立专责制时规定：只有机长和班长才能掌握钻机上的给进把和升降机把；其余的钻工一律不准扶把，只是干些上台板和搬钻杆等工作。因此，钻工们学习操作技术的迫切要求得不到满足，思想情绪有了波动。但领导方面并不重视和及时研究解决这个问题。中央燃料工业部干部学校钻探队毕业的学员经过了四个月的理论学习和两个月的钻房操作实习，都初步具备了一定的理论技术基础和为祖国钻探事业服务的决心；再经过六个月的实习，一般可以提拔为机长或技术员。但他们到淮南矿务局实习时，却得不到扶把的机会，绝大部分人被分配做地质和行政管理等工作。经他们一再要求，有一个人被分配到钻机上去，同样还是光干扫地和上台板等活。这样怎能达到实习的目的呢？
    淮南矿务局钻探队的领导干部这样把建立专责制和培养钻探人材对立起来的做法是不对的。在建立专责制以前，钻探工作效率低、质量差、事故多，这是事实。但是要克服这些缺点，领导方面更应该重视工人的政治教育，有计划地提高普通钻工的技术水平。特别在祖国有计划的经济建设的时期，为了建立专责制而忽视培养新一代的钻探技术人员，更是不对的。
  中央燃料工业部基本建设司
      的意见
    中央燃料工业部基本建设司来信：景荣生、杨荣林两同志的意见是正确的。建立专责制度的重要目的之一，正是为了培养精通业务的技术员工，以便顺利完成当前国家的建设任务并为将来的建设工作准备条件；而也只有积极培养和提高工人群众的政治觉悟和技术水平，才是贯彻专责制的有力保证。因此，淮南矿务局钻探队在建立专责制时忽视培养技术人员，甚至把二者对立起来，这是完全错误的。而这种错误的观点和做法，在目前某些厂矿单位也是存在的。
    在煤矿钻探工作中，已经有一些把培养干部和建立专责制结合起来的范例。如焦作矿务局钻探队四号钻机在去年三月到十二月间，由于正确地实行了“包教包学”的办法，培养出正副班长八人、熟练钻工二十余人，同时完成了工作任务。
    今年四月，全国煤矿地质钻探会议上，也曾研究了这个问题，并作出如下规定：（一）钻机在钻进煤层、标志层和复杂地层时，必须由班长亲自扶把；（二）一般正常的钻进，可由助手（或称副班长）掌握给进把；（三）为加速培养钻探技术工人，必须给学徒工或实习员一定的扶把机会，但班长必须在旁指导。这说明中央燃料工业部等领导部门是重视培养钻探技术工人的。
      总之，在保证工作质量、效率和安全的情况下，应该给钻工较多的扶把时间。这就是说：领导人不仅要对工程负责，而且也要对培养技术人材负责。
  润河集船闸工程质量低劣
    治淮委员会应进行检查
    读者饶师佩、张震环来信：治淮委员会在润河集分水闸旁建筑了一座近代化的船闸。这对淮河中上游的物资交流和航运事业是有利的。但是，由于润河集船闸指挥所领导方面对施工重视不够，工程质量十分低劣。据不完全统计，整个混凝土工程有蜂窝、漏洞三百四十三处，漏钢筋二十六处。经过河水冲刷，有些漏洞已逐渐扩大。在东边第二块闸室的三层与四层间，由于混凝土不凝结，有的空心洞可以伸进一个拳头。
    由于施工计划性不强，窝工、返工现象也很严重。如排水层原计划五天至七天造好，事前就通知民工按时上堤；结果这个工程一个月才完工，致使民工整整窝工一个月。当时正是农忙时期，这就直接影响了农业生产。又如排水沟、蓄水池等工程，挖了又平，平了又挖，一再返工，造成很大浪费。
    工人们对工程质量低劣和施工中返工浪费的情况是不满意的，他们曾一再向领导方面提出改进工作的意见。但是润河集船闸指挥所的领导同志没有采纳群众的意见。当群众在治淮周报上批评他们不重视工程质量时，工程指挥周玉三还说批评者是“乱写”稿子。工人们向政治委员徐瑞甫反映工程质量低劣的问题，徐瑞甫也以“这是细小问题”为藉口来搪塞敷衍。更恶劣的是，当治淮委员会要验收这个工程时，润河集船闸指挥所领导方面就把里闸墙刷上灰水，外闸墙糊上泥浆，闸内放进一公尺深的水，企图掩盖缺点。
    我们建议治淮委员会彻底检查润河集船闸工程的质量和工程指挥所的工作，并进行必要的处理。国营一二零厂新建职工宿舍
  暖气工程返工浪费十二亿元
    读者刘选斌、刘启民来信：国营一二零厂在去年修建的职工宿舍，暖气工程质量低劣，有的根本不能使用，冬天室内还会结冰。今年返工修理时，更发现了地沟基础下沉、管道漏水、盖板压碎、包管道的布烂掉、石棉灰脱落、暖气与下水道相碰等严重问题。因此，返工量达全部工程的百分之六十，使国家浪费了十二亿元的返工费用。
    这个工程的承包单位（原东北重工业部第四工程处）在设计、施工中有许多不能令人容忍的错误。他们任意偷工减料，不按图施工。如地沟盖板有四百多块用的是耐压力很差的薄板，根本不合标准，在返修时已有百分之二十三被压碎了。有的地方，如家属住宅每幢房子进屋地段的地沟，甚至连这样的盖板都没安就填上了土。他们又违犯设计与施工规程，将管道第六支线南头的暖气管从下水道的两个窨井内通过，这样不但使暖气不能畅通，而且使下水道质量也受到影响而需要返工。有些地沟墙砌得高低不平、横竖不成缝、宽度不适当；有百分之九十的地沟墙未刷沥青等防潮层，以致管道上所包的布已全部烂掉，石棉灰也大量脱落，影响保温。此外，地沟混凝土有三十二处、一百六十四公尺的基础下沉，裂缝三米厘到十五米厘宽的有五百七十六公尺。干线管道滑动支架的水泥橙有七十二处被压碎。
    我们要求原东北重工业部第四工程处的领导方面对这个问题认真追查责任，进行严肃处理。
  绥远省话剧团
    整编中情况混乱
    绥远省话剧团曲乃健、王秀芳、冯润来信：绥远省文工团在今年六月份和山西省总工会文工团合编为绥远省话剧团。在整编中，由于绥远省文化局和省文工团领导干部存在着本位主义思想，发生了混乱情况。
    整编开始时，绥远省文化局负责人周大鹏和省文工团队长史大千等，不考虑实际情况和工作需要，只想多搞些人来，并用“可以实行薪金制”的话，鼓励山西省总工会文工团多来些人。结果，山西省总工会文工团按原来规定多来了十九人，连会计和乐队都来了。话剧团编制超额，上级不能批准，除了增设音乐组可以容纳一些人员外，便又不得不动员部分人员转业。山西省总工会文工团转业的四个人中，有一个怀孕六个月而又患着严重心脏病的女同志。她被介绍到华北行政委员会文化局分配工作，到北京后，华北文化局不收，又调回绥远。这样长途往返显然是不妥当的。
    整编后的话剧团，有些同志思想波动不安。我们希望有关领导部门能迅速处理，及早结束话剧团这种混乱情况。
