Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, September 4th: The Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) and the Korean People's Army (KPA) actively assisted the Korean people in repairing Jianlong (also known as Shiyan) Reservoir, one of North Korea's important irrigation facilities, on August 14th, after it was destroyed by the US invasion army's air force.

Jianlong Reservoir is located at the intersection of Pingwon County and Sunan County in South Pyongan Province, North Korea. The reservoir has a circumference of more than 30 kilometers and a storage capacity of 34.42 million cubic meters, irrigating more than 3,400 hectares of land. It is one of North Korea's famous irrigation facilities. On May 13th and 14th of this year, the reservoir was severely damaged by the barbaric bombing of the US invading air force. The dam of the reservoir was destroyed, and floods inundated large areas of land in Sunan County, Pingwon County, Daedong County, and the suburbs of Pyongyang, turning hundreds of hectares of fertile land into rivers. More than 2,000 households were affected by the disaster, and more than 800 Korean residents were drowned. At that time, the Korean government immediately took emergency measures to help the victims resettle and resume production. The CPV troops stationed nearby also carried out rescue operations under enemy air raids and distributed a large amount of food, seeds, and clothing to aid the Korean victims.

The repair work of Jianlong Reservoir began on May 23rd. The commanders and fighters of the CPV and the KPA participating in the repair project worked day and night on the dam under the slogan "One more drop of sweat, the Korean people can produce one more dou of grain." They dug silt from mud pits as deep as their waists and transported earth from several miles away, averaging more than 70 li per person per day, carrying more than 4,000 jin. When continuous heavy rain caused the water level to rise above the dam, Zheng Bo, the commander of a certain unit of the CPV, issued a call to the troops at the construction site to "race against the flood" and personally joined the soldiers in filling grass bags and blocking the flood, working continuously in the rain for 12 hours. During the 80-plus days of intense repair work, the CPV troops contributed more than 200,000 man-days, transported more than 2 million cubic meters of earth, repaired 5,200 meters of canals, and built more than 47,000 meters of ring-pool roads. With the joint efforts of the Chinese and Korean troops and the Korean people, the destroyed reservoir was quickly revived. During the repair of the reservoir, the anti-aircraft artillery units of the Chinese and Korean forces played an important role in ensuring the smooth progress of the entire project. They shot down seven enemy planes in three days.

The repair project of Jianlong Reservoir was successfully completed on August 14th. On August 17th, a grand completion ceremony was held for Jianlong Reservoir. At the meeting, Park Mun-kyu, the Minister of Agriculture of the Korean Cabinet, read out a letter of thanks from Marshal Kim Il-sung to the KPA and CPV troops who assisted in repairing the reservoir. Park Mun-kyu, on behalf of the Korean government, presented a banner to the CPV unit where the immortal internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, who participated in the Jianlong Reservoir repair project, served before his death. To thank the CPV and KPA soldiers for their great contributions in the Jianlong Reservoir repair project, the Korean people of South Pyongan Province built a magnificent monument on the banks of the reservoir.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 4th: Marshal Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, wrote a letter on August 17th to the CPV units participating in the repair of the Jianlong (Shiyan) Reservoir, thanking them for their contributions in helping the Korean people restore construction. The full text is as follows:
To all the officers and soldiers of the CPV units:

The Jianlong (Shiyan) Reservoir, which was barbarously bombed by the American aggressors, has been completely restored today under your selfless labor and active struggle.

On behalf of the Korean people and in my personal name, I express my highest praise for your glorious achievements in the project of repairing the reservoir, which is of great significance to Korean agriculture, and extend my fighting congratulations and deep gratitude.

You have not only defeated the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people—the American imperialist armed aggressors—in battle and achieved brilliant victories, but today, in the rear of Korea, you have further promoted the spirit of lofty internationalism and sincerely assisted us. Regardless of the various difficulties in the construction, you completed the reconstruction of the reservoir in a short period of time. This new victory achieved by the Chinese and Korean people in the work of restoring the reservoir in the struggle for happiness once again proves that the flesh-and-blood unity of the Chinese and Korean people is an invincible and unbreakable iron force. Your achievements will shine forever on the monument of the reservoir.

I wish you new achievements and victories in the common struggle for the victory of the Chinese and Korean people and world peace.

Kim Il-sung
Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
August 17, 1953

    志愿军协助朝鲜修复见龙贮水池
    金日成首相函志愿军部队致谢
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军部队，积极协助朝鲜人民在八月十四日修复了被美国侵朝空军炸毁的朝鲜人民重要灌溉设施之一——见龙（即石岩）贮水池。
    见龙贮水池位于朝鲜平安南道平原郡和顺安郡交界的地方。贮水池周长三十多公里，贮水量达三千四百十二万立方公尺，可灌溉三千四百多顷土地，是朝鲜著名的灌溉设施之一。今年五月十三、十四两日，这个贮水池在美国侵朝空军的野蛮轰炸下受到严重的破坏。贮水池堤坝被毁，洪水淹没了顺安郡、平原郡、大同郡与平壤市郊区的大片土地，将数百公顷良田冲成河流。受灾人民有二千多户，被溺毙的朝鲜居民达八百名以上。当时，朝鲜政府立即采取了紧急措施，帮助灾民安家，生产渡荒。驻在附近的中国人民志愿军部队也在敌机轰炸下进行了抢救，并散发了大批粮食、种籽和衣物救济朝鲜灾民。
    见龙贮水池的修复工程开始于五月二十三日。参加这一修复工程的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军指挥员、战斗员们，在“多流一滴汗、朝鲜人民就能多打一斗粮”的口号下，日夜在堤上进行抢修工作。他们从深及腰部的泥坑里挖出淤泥，并从数里外搬来土方，平均每人每天往返七十多里，背重四千多斤。在连日大雨、水位将要超过堤坝时，中国人民志愿军某部指挥员郑波在工地上向部队发出了“和洪水赛跑”的号召，并且亲自和战士们一道装草袋、堵洪水，连续在雨中进行了十二小时的紧张的劳动。在八十多天紧张的抢修工作中，中国人民志愿军部队共出人工二十多万个，运土二百多万立方公尺，修水渠五千二百公尺，筑环池公路四万七千多公尺。在朝中人民部队和朝鲜人民的共同努力下，被毁的贮水池又迅速地复活了。在贮水池的修复过程中，朝中部队的高射炮部队在保证全部工程的顺利进行上起了重要作用。他们曾在三天内击落了七架敌机。
    见龙贮水池的修复工程在八月十四日全部胜利结束。八月十七日，举行了见龙贮水池竣工典礼大会。会上，朝鲜内阁农业相朴文圭朗读了金日成元帅给协助修复贮水池的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军部队的感谢信。朴文圭并代表朝鲜政府将锦旗赠给参加见龙贮水池修复工程的不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教烈士生前所在的中国人民志愿军部队。为了感谢中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军勇士们在抢修见龙贮水池工作中的伟大功勋，平安南道的朝鲜人民并在贮水池畔建立了一座雄伟的纪念碑。
    【新华社平壤四日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成元帅，在八月十七日写信给中国人民志愿军参加修复见龙（石岩）贮水池的部队，感谢他们在帮助朝鲜人民恢复建设中所建立的功勋。全文如下：中国人民志愿军部队全体将士们：
    被美国侵略者野蛮地炸毁了的见龙（石岩）贮水池，在你们的忘我劳动和积极斗争下，今天又完全恢复了。
    我代表朝鲜人民并以我个人的名义，对你们在修复在朝鲜农业上有重大意义的贮水池工程中的辉煌功勋，表示崇高的赞扬，并致以战斗的祝贺和深深的感谢。
    你们不仅在战斗中打败了朝中人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义武装侵略者，取得了辉煌的胜利，而且今天在朝鲜后方，更发扬了高度的国际主义精神，真诚地援助我们。你们不顾修建中的各种困难，在短短的时间内，完成了贮水池的重建。我们朝中人民在为了幸福而斗争的恢复贮水池工作中所取得的这个新的胜利，又证明了朝中人民的血肉般的团结，是一种必胜不败的钢铁般的力量。你们的业绩，将在贮水池的纪念碑上永放光芒。
    我预祝你们在为朝中人民胜利与世界和平的共同斗争中，获得新的成就和胜利。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成
    一九五三年八月十七日
