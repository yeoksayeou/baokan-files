    [This newspaper dispatch] Since the second half of August, most drought-affected areas in the south have successively received rainfall, and farmers are actively rushing to plant late autumn crops.
    After rainfall in Zhejiang Province in late August, party and government organs at all levels immediately led farmers in carrying out crash planting and seedling replanting work. Counties such as Pujiang, Shouchang, and Yiwu have experienced more rainfall, and crash planting, crop conversion, and seedling replanting work have entered a climax. In areas with more intermediate rice such as Chun'an, Xianju, Huangyan, Lin'an, Tonglu, Yuqian, and Kaihua counties, thanks to relying on the masses to overcome difficulties, preparations for harvesting and crash planting were made before the rain. After the rain, timely harvesting and planting were generally achieved. As of now, over 85% of the areas in Jiande County have completed the crash planting task. In the drought-affected areas of Jinjiang Special District, Fujian Province, the masses have been actively rushing to plant after the rain, with 150,000 mu of late rice and 500,000 mu of sweet potato fields already planted. Since the second half of August, all parts of Jiangxi Province have made the crash planting a task that overrides everything else in the countryside. The Shangrao Special District of the province has transferred a large number of cadres from government offices, led by responsible cadres of the special district party and government, to various counties to assist local people's governments in leading the masses to rush to plant autumn crops such as millet, corn, and soybeans. Shangrao County had completed 90% of the area to be planted by August 25th. In parts of Fengcheng, Nanchang, Shanggao and other counties in Nanchang Special District, the planting task has been basically completed. In Chongren County, the drought resistance work team was immediately transformed into a crash planting work team after the rain, and a crash planting was carried out. The county rushed to plant more than 4,000 mu of various miscellaneous grains in five days. In Hubei Province, late rice was basically transplanted in mid-August, with an increase in the area compared to last year. Since then, various regions have also planted a large number of late autumn crops. The rush planting and replanting work in drought-affected areas of Hunan Province is also proceeding intensively. In the four counties of Liuyang, Li County, Pingjiang, and You County, more than 24,000 mu of late crops were converted to other crops in late August. In Chaling County, more than 80,000 mu of autumn crops have been replanted. In Guangxi Province, Rong County and Yongning Special District basically completed rice transplanting in mid-August, Qinzhou Special District transplanted more than 90%, and Ping Le, Yishan and other Special Districts transplanted about 50%. After harvesting early rice, the counties of Guilin Special District immediately planted sweet potatoes and beans and other miscellaneous grains. The autumn planting area in all counties this year has been expanded by more than 20% compared to last year. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region also promptly notified all regions after the rain to seize the opportunity to complete the rush planting and crop conversion work. Binyang County rushed to plant more than 90% of the area to be planted within a few days. In Guangdong Province, all efforts were made to rush to transplant rice seedlings in mid-August. The eastern Guangdong area has transplanted 90% of seedlings, the western Guangdong area has transplanted 14%, and after the rain on the 17th, transplanting throughout the province was no longer a problem. In Yunnan Province, widespread rainfall also occurred in various places from August 19th to 24th. The masses in various places rushed to save rice seedlings. Responsible cadres of the CCP Dayao County Committee went deep into the fields to solve the problem of rational water use, saving all 800 mu of rice seedlings that were about to die. After the rain, the masses of Chuncha Township in Wuding County repaired three drainage ditches and diverted mountain water into the fields, benefiting more than 800 mu of land. In addition, the masses in some disaster-stricken areas in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces also actively planted late autumn crops such as buckwheat and sweet potatoes.
    At present, party and government leading organs in various disaster-stricken areas are continuing to lead the masses to strengthen drought prevention and resistance work, and are actively removing pests, weeding, and processing fertilizer, in an effort to increase the harvest of late autumn crops. Drought still exists in a few areas of Zhejiang Province. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has issued a notice proposing specific measures to continue to protect autumn crops. In Jiangsu Province, the rainfall in Yixing, Liyang, Jintan and other counties, as well as Songjiang Special District and coastal counties, has been relatively small. Although the drought has eased, it has not been resolved, so efforts should still be made to secure water sources and continue drought resistance. Although widespread rainfall has occurred in the south of Anhui Province, most areas north of the Huai River have not received rain, and the drought situation remains tense. The local leading organs are paying close attention to this situation. Rainfall in various parts of Yunnan Province is also uneven. Rainfall is still scarce in some areas. The masses in various places are continuing to block mountain water to save seedlings and rice, seizing the opportunity to repair ponds, and paying attention to storing and conserving water. In some areas, cadres and the masses developed a blindly optimistic attitude because of the rain. After inspection, they discovered that drought prevention and resistance work is still an important task to ensure a bumper harvest in late autumn. For example, in Yongwu Township, Guixian County, Guangxi Province, rice transplanting was completed in mid-August, followed by rain. Therefore, cadres and the masses relaxed their drought prevention and resistance work. Recent inspections revealed that many fields have become dry again, some have already cracked. Only then did they pay attention to drought prevention and resistance work again. In addition, in some areas this year, the labor force has not been fully mobilized and organized in the drought resistance and crash planting, the accumulation of fertilizer is insufficient, and the cultivation is rough, which has already affected the growth of autumn rice. Therefore, strengthening field management and doing a good job in weeding, pest control, and processing fertilizer have become very important tasks to ensure increased production of late autumn crops.

    南方受旱地区相继降雨
    农民积极抢种晚秋作物
    各地亟需继续防旱抗旱加强田间管理
    【本报讯】八月下半月以来，南方受旱地区大部已先后落雨，农民积极抢种晚秋作物。
    浙江省在八月下旬降雨后，各地党政机关立即领导农民进行抢种、补苗工作。浦江、寿昌、义乌等县下雨较多，抢种、改种、补苗工作已进入高潮。中稻较多的淳安、仙居、黄岩、临安、桐庐、于潜、开化等县不少地区，由于依靠群众克服困难，在雨前就作好了收割和抢种准备工作，雨后一般都做到适时收割和种植。建德县到目前为止，已有百分之八十五以上的地区完成抢种任务。福建省晋江专区受旱地区，群众在雨后积极抢种，有十五万亩晚稻和五十万亩番薯田已经抢插完毕。江西省各地八月下半月以来，都把突击抢种作为农村中压倒一切的任务。该省上饶专区抽调大批机关干部由专区党政负责干部率领，分赴各县协助当地人民政府领导群众抢种小黍、玉米、大豆等秋季作物。上饶县在八月二十五日以前就已完成应抢种面积百分之九十。南昌专区的丰城、南昌、上高等县部分地区已经基本上完成了抢种任务。崇仁县在雨后立即把抗旱工作队转为抢种工作队，突击抢种，全县在五天内就抢种各种杂粮四千余亩。湖北省晚稻在八月中旬已经基本插完，比去年晚稻面积有增加。以后，各地又大量种植了晚秋作物。湖南省受旱地区的抢种、补种工作也在紧张进行。浏阳、澧县、平江、攸县等四县，在八月下旬改种了晚庄稼二万四千余亩。茶陵县已补种秋季作物八万余亩。广西省容县、邕宁专区八月中旬已基本结束了插秧工作，钦州专区插秧百分之九十以上，平乐、宜山等专区都插秧百分之五十左右。桂林专区各县在收割了早禾以后，紧接着又种上了红薯和豆子等杂粮。今年各县的秋种面积都比去年扩大了百分之二十以上。桂西僮族自治区也在雨后及时通知各地，抓紧时机完成抢种改种工作。宾阳县数天内就抢种了应种面积百分之九十以上。广东省八月中旬全力抢插秧苗，粤东区已插秧百分之九十，粤西区已插秧百分之十四，十七日雨后，全省插秧已无问题。云南省各地也在八月十九日到二十四日普遍降雨。各地群众都突击抢救禾苗。中共大姚县委负责干部深入田间解决了合理用水问题，使快要干死的八百亩秧苗全部获救。武定县春岔乡群众雨后抢修了三条排水沟，把山水引到田里，使八百多亩田得到水。此外，江苏、安徽两省部分受灾地区群众，也积极抢种了荞麦、红薯等晚秋作物。
    目前，各受灾地区党、政领导机关正继续领导群众加强防旱抗旱工作，并积极除虫、除草、加工施肥，尽力争取晚秋作物增加收获量。浙江省少数地区旱象仍然存在，该省农林厅已经发出通知，提出继续保秋的具体措施。江苏省宜兴、溧阳、金坛等县和松江专区及沿海各县雨量较少，旱象虽然缓和，但仍未解除，所以仍应争取水源，继续抗旱。安徽省江南各地虽已普遍降雨，但淮北绝大部分地区仍未下雨，旱情仍然紧张。当地领导机关十分注意这一情况。云南省各地雨量也不平均，有的地区雨量仍然稀少，各地群众正继续堵山水救苗禾，抓紧修整水塘，注意蓄水、保水。有的地区的干部和群众，因为下过了雨而产生了盲目乐观情绪，经过检查，才又发现防旱抗旱工作仍是保证晚秋丰收的重要工作。如广西省贵县永梧乡在八月中旬即已插秧完毕，插秧后接着又下了雨，因此干部和群众都放松了防旱抗旱工作，经过最近检查，发现许多田地又已呈现干旱，有的已经开坼，此后才又重视了防旱抗旱工作。另外，有的地区今年在抗旱抢种中，没有充分发动和组织劳动力，积肥不足，耕作粗糙，目前已影响了秋禾的生长，因此，加强田间管理，做好除草、除虫、加工施肥等，已成为保证晚秋作物增产十分重要的工作。
