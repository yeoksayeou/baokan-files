Xinhua News Agency, dated 16th: Vietnam News Agency reports that the Vietnamese Council of Ministers held a meeting at the end of August, presided over by President Ho Chi Minh. The meeting decided to continuously strengthen the people's power in all aspects in order to better advance the resistance war and achieve greater victories.

General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, reported on the military situation at the meeting. He emphasized that the recent withdrawal of French colonial troops from Na San was a major failure of the French army's plan to reoccupy the Northwest region of Vietnam and a major victory for the Vietnamese people. With the liberation of Na San, almost the entire Northwest region has been liberated.

In his report, General Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that the Vietnamese people must be vigilant against the enemy's new military conspiracies, actively strengthen armed forces in the enemy's rear and in the liberated areas, and not miss any opportunity to eliminate the enemy.

The meeting heard a report by Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong summarizing the first phase of the movement to mobilize the masses to implement the government's land policy, and the work plan for the second phase. The meeting also heard a report on the production movement.

The meeting adopted a plan to mobilize the peasant masses and approved the policy of protecting religious freedom proposed by the Vietnam National United Front.
