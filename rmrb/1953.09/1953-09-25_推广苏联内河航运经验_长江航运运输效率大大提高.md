Promoting Soviet Inland Waterway Navigation Experience
Yangtze River Shipping Transport Efficiency Greatly Improved

    The Yangtze River Shipping Administration, by implementing advanced Soviet inland waterway navigation experience and improving towing methods, channel markers, and dock loading and unloading operations, has greatly improved the efficiency of ship transportation.
    In terms of towing, in April of this year, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration began piloting the "push towing method" (binding three or five barge fleets into an arrowhead shape, with the ship pushing the barges forward from the middle) on the Hankou to Huangshi route. The results proved that this advanced towing method increased speed by 20% and saved 13% to 15% of fuel compared to the "single-line towing method." In August, the "push towing method" was universally implemented on the Hankou to Yichang route.
    In terms of ship dispatching, since September 1st, 20 fast passenger and cargo ships along the entire Yangtze River have implemented a method of rhythmically dispatching ships according to new ship operation charts. This advanced Soviet experience had already been trialed in the Huaxin and Huagang fleets in April and May of this year, with good results. Before dispatching ships according to the operation chart, the Huaxin fleet could only make three round trips from Hankou to Huangshi per month. Now, it can make five round trips per month. After promoting this dispatching method, port loading and unloading departments, cargo owners, and passengers can know in advance when ships will arrive, allowing them to make all preparations with ease, quickly load and unload cargo after the ship arrives, and shorten mooring time. In addition, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration's dispatching机构 can clearly see the cargo throughput of each port from the ship operation charts, facilitating the mobile and timely dispatch of ships berthed at each port, thereby improving ship turnover rate and maximizing overall transportation efficiency.
    To ensure the safety of navigation, the Channel Engineering Department of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration began learning from the advanced experience of Soviet inland waterway markers in January of this year, setting up beaded new navigation markers on the Hankou to Yichang route. The entire project was completed ahead of schedule in August. The old Yangtze River markers did not serve as navigational aids. The new markers are set up on average every two kilometers or so, and all emit light at night. Incoming and outgoing ships do not need navigation guides and can navigate smoothly day and night. Sailors said: "The new Soviet-style markers are really good. Now we can navigate at night just like during the day. Navigation is safer, and ship turnover is faster. We must learn from the advanced Soviet experience." The Yangtze River Shipping Administration is now preparing to comprehensively set them up along the entire Yangtze River in a step-by-step manner to ensure the safety of ships navigating day and night.
    Port loading and unloading operations are an important link in ensuring cargo transportation and strengthening ship turnover. Since the Yangtze River Shipping Administration convened a port director meeting in April to discuss strengthening port operations, the ports of Jiujiang, Chongqing, Yichang, Anqing, Zhenjiang, and others have achieved remarkable results in improving this work. For example, due to the leadership's emphasis on fully relying on and mobilizing stevedores, the loading and unloading efficiency of the Jiujiang Port Authority has increased month by month. The loading and unloading efficiency of the port in February was: 53 tons per hour for liner ships and 26 tons per hour for barge ships. By April, it had increased to: 117 tons per hour for liner ships and 72 tons per hour for barge ships. In July and August of this year, when the weather was hot and the loading and unloading efficiency of general ports decreased, the port was still able to create several new records. Due to the improvement of loading and unloading operations, not only was the ship operation schedule guaranteed and the transportation task over-fulfilled, but also labor costs were reduced by 28% to 30%, and workers' income increased by 30%.
    In order to organize Yangtze River water transportation rhythmically and conduct planned management, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration began a comprehensive production reform in the second half of this year. In the process of production reform, the bureau will further promote advanced Soviet experience, tap the potential of Yangtze River shipping, improve transportation efficiency, and better serve to promote the exchange of urban and rural materials and the economic construction of the motherland.

### 推广苏联内河航运经验  长江航运运输效率大大提高

    推广苏联内河航运经验
    长江航运运输效率大大提高
    长江航运管理局推行苏联先进内河航运经验，改进了拖驳运输方法、航道标志、码头装卸工作，使船舶运输效率大大提高。
    在拖驳运输方面，今年四月份，长江航运管理局在汉口到黄石市的航线上开始试行“推船运航法”（即将三个或五个驳船队绑成箭头形，轮船夹在中间推驳船前进的运航法）。结果证明，这一先进的拖驳运输法，比“一列式拖驳运输法”的速度提高百分之二十，节省燃料百分之十三到十五。八月份，在汉口到宜昌的航线上已普遍实行“推船运航法”。
    在调度船只方面，长江全线自九月一日开始已有二十艘快速客货轮实行了按新式船只运行图表有节奏地调度船只的办法。这一苏联先进经验早在今年四、五月份，就在华新、华钢两船队试行中，得到良好效果。没有按照运行图表调度船只之前，华新船队每月从汉口到黄石市只能往返三次。现在每月可往返五次。推广这个调度方法之后，港湾装卸工作部门，货主、旅客都能事先知道船只何时到达，可以从容进行一切准备工作。使船只到达后，迅速装卸货物，缩短停泊时间。此外，长江航运管理局的调度机构从船舶运行图表中，可以清楚地看出各港湾的货物吞吐量，便于机动、及时地调度停靠各港湾的船舶。从而使船舶周转率提高，发挥了全部的运输效能。
    为了保证航行的安全，长江航运管理局航道工程处从今年一月份开始，学习了苏联内河航标的先进经验。在汉口到宜昌的航线上设置连珠式的新航标。全部工程已提前于八月份完成。长江旧有的航标，不起助航的作用，新标志平均每二公里左右设置一个，夜间全部放光。来往船只不用航行指南，昼夜可顺利航行。船员们说：“苏联新式航标真好。现在我们夜间航行和白天一样。航行安全了，船舶周转也快了。我们要好好学习苏联先进经验。”长江航运管理局现正准备在长江全线有步骤地全面设置，以保证船舶昼夜航行的安全。
    港湾装卸作业是保证货物运输、加强船舶周转的一个重要环节。自长江航运管理局在四月份召开港长会议，讨论加强港湾作业后，九江、重庆、宜昌、安庆、镇江等港在改进这一工作上都收到显著成绩。如九江港务局由于领导上的重视，充分依靠与发动搬运工人，使装卸效率逐月提高。该港在二月份装卸效率是：班轮每小时五十三吨，轮驳每小时二十六吨。到四月份就提高到：班轮每小时一百十七吨，轮驳每小时七十二吨。在今年七、八月份天气炎热，一般港湾装卸效率降低的情况下，该港还能创造几次新纪录。由于装卸作业的改进，不但保证了船舶运行时刻，超额完成了运输任务，同时也降低了力资百分之二十八到三十，增加了工人收入百分之三十。
    为了有节奏地组织长江水上运输，进行计划管理，长江航运管理局从今年下半年开始，展开全面的生产改革。在生产改革过程中，该局将进一步推广苏联先进经验，发掘长江航运的潜在能力，提高运输效率，更好地为促进城乡物资交流和祖国经济建设服务。　（本报中南记者站）
