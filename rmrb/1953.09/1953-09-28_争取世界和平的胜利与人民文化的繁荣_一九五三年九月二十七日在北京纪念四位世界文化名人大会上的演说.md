The Chinese people, embracing the confidence of peace and victory and respecting the cultural heritage of mankind, accepted the suggestion of the World Peace Council and are commemorating four great international cultural figures this year in 1953: China's Qu Yuan, Poland's Nicolaus Copernicus, France's François Rabelais, and Cuba's José Martí.

These four great contributors and advocates of human culture are immortal. Although Qu Yuan died 2,230 years ago, Copernicus died 410 years ago, Rabelais died 400 years ago, and José Martí, if he were still alive, would be 100 years old, they still live in the hearts of the people of the world. Although they were born in different eras and different countries, they jointly fought for the justice and progress of mankind throughout their lives, and their creative labor added valuable heritage to human culture. Their ideals, their work, and their struggles are connected with the interests of the people of that time and place, and from the perspective of the specific historical significance of their lives, they are also connected with the current interests of the people of the world.

Last year we commemorated Hugo, da Vinci, Gogol, and Avicenna, and this year we commemorate these four great cultural figures again. We deeply realize that the people of the world have full confidence in inheriting and carrying forward the excellent cultural traditions of mankind, and in uniting to make the lofty ideals jointly pursued by the cultural giants—friendship among peoples, free life, and lasting peace—possible to realize.

The first cultural giant to be commemorated at this meeting is China's Qu Yuan.

Qu Yuan was China's first great patriotic poet. Throughout his life, he yearned for freedom and justice, loved his country and people, hated the corrupt and incompetent ruling class, and finally sacrificed his life to bury his ideals. His works have had a profound influence on the development of Chinese literature, leaving a brilliant model for later poets. For more than two thousand years, the patriotic enthusiasm expressed in his poems has continuously generated new inspiring power for readers of all eras.

Qu Yuan was born in 340 BC, during the "Warring States" period in Chinese history. The twelve major powers of the Spring and Autumn period had already merged into seven major powers, fighting each other to complete the unification of China. He was born in the Chu state in the Yangtze River basin, and he hoped that the Chu state could save the people from their suffering and complete this glorious task. Although Qu Yuan was a descendant of the Chu aristocracy, he had been in close contact with the common people for a long time and deeply felt their suffering, so he had an upright character and progressive ideas, and his works were full of strong popular character.

Qu Yuan loved his country and people. Not only did he express his strong political inclinations in his works, sympathizing with the suffering of the people, but also in his position as "Left Minister" of the Chu state, he always adhered to the enlightened political ideal of sympathizing with the people. He admired the wise emperors of ancient China who had once benefited the people, hated the aristocratic groups who indulged in pleasure and were arrogant, and advocated abolishing the aristocratic system, widely employing talented people, revitalizing the country, and improving people's livelihood. This kind of enlightened political thought, of course, could not be tolerated by the Chu nobles in power who pursued personal interests. Therefore, in the court of the Chu state, fierce struggles took place between Qu Yuan and those nobles who acted perversely and recklessly.

Unfortunately, King Huai of Chu was a shallow, indecisive, and conceited mediocrity. Although he had once relied on Qu Yuan, he not only did not adopt Qu Yuan's advice to alleviate the suffering of the people, but instead listened to the slander of the villains around him, gradually alienated and finally exiled him. For more than twenty years thereafter, Qu Yuan lived a life of exile in grief and anger, suffering almost unbearably; but he loved his homeland and people and never left the Chu state. When King Huai of Chu was surrounded by reactionary nobles, indulging in extravagance and recklessness, so that the Chu state, which had the largest territory and the richest products among the seven Warring States, declined in his hands, Qu Yuan's pain and anxiety were extremely deep.

But the unfortunate experiences and isolated feelings instead made Qu Yuan's literary talent bloom with unprecedentedly brilliant flowers. During his exile, he constantly used poetry to embody his lofty ideals. His poems are full of majestic imagination and crystal-clear thoughts and feelings, expressing his noble character,激越 spirit of resistance, and deep love for his country and people. His enemies originally attempted to use slander and framing to erase his name from the memory of the people, but the facts were contrary to their wishful thinking: Qu Yuan, the immortal author of "Li Sao," not only deeply won the sympathy of the people of Chu, but was also forever inseparable from the glorious cultural tradition of the entire Chinese people.

Since Qu Yuan loved his country and people, when in 278 BC, the twenty-first year of King Qingxiang, son of King Huai of Chu, the Qin army broke through the capital of Chu and drove south, occupying the area around Dongting Lake south of the Yangtze River, Qu Yuan felt the despair of the future of the Chu state and finally jumped into the Miluo River in Hunan Province, ending his tragic life. The upright Qu Yuan failed in the political struggle. His failure has aroused sympathy and admiration from the people for thousands of years. Obviously, this sympathy and admiration are mainly due to his sincere love for his country and people, his pursuit of ideals, and his unwavering personality and integrity. Qu Yuan's achievement in literature lies in the fact that his poems perfectly express these noble qualities, thus achieving a high degree of unity of ideological and artistic value.

Qu Yuan's poems are a precious treasure in the classical Chinese literary heritage and one of the great contributions of the Chinese people to human culture. The popular character and patriotism expressed in Qu Yuan's literary creation have been given new meaning in our era and have gained abundant power to defeat the evil forces.

Today, we also commemorate Nicolaus Copernicus of Poland, the pioneer of modern natural science. In the process of mankind's pursuit of objective truth, Copernicus is a milestone.

In Europe more than four hundred years ago, the feudal ruling forces of the Middle Ages used the tedious philosophy of slaves to build a dark prison for human thought. But human thought cannot be imprisoned, it must advance along the road of social development. When the emerging bourgeoisie led the peasants and the earliest proletariat to attack the feudal economic base of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance era appeared in the cultural history of Western Europe, which was the "era that needed giants." Among those heroic figures who fought like dragons and tigers against the corrupt and stinking medieval culture, Copernicus was the most outstanding in the field of natural science.

Like the "complete men" of that time who were not limited by the division of labor, Copernicus was versatile and knowledgeable. He was an excellent mathematician, a famous economist, a prestigious doctor, he was proficient in mechanics and surveying, familiar with Latin, Greek and all ancient arts; he was also a painter and a social activist. However, what made his name immortal was his great contribution to astronomy. His epoch-making masterpiece "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" broke through the theological prison of the Middle Ages, liberated human reason, and declared the victory of science.

In Europe, since Aristotle, mankind has had a deep-rooted belief in the special position of the earth in the sky. The "geocentric theory" or "geokinetic theory" of the Greek astronomer Ptolemy was the basis of this belief. This erroneous theory was beneficial to consolidating the concept of divine power and feudal autocracy, so the feudal forces of the Middle Ages fully supported this false science, using it to prove that the world was immutable and that the ruling power of the world was also immutable, so as to support the feudal ruling class of the Middle Ages and facilitate the continued enslavement of the people. However, with the development of social productive forces, the truth cannot be buried for long. After nearly forty years of hard research, Copernicus finally discovered the error of Ptolemy, exposed the evil tricks of the feudal ruling class, and replaced the "geocentric theory" and "anthropocentric theory" with a new concept of the world. With the courage given by science, he challenged the dark ruling forces at that time: "The earth is not the center of the universe, but only one of many planets, revolving around the sun with them, and rotating around its own axis." In an era when human thought could not go beyond the Bible, Copernicus's bold declaration was of course a major revolutionary action. It not only directly confronted subjective speculation with objective truth, but also made mankind begin to understand using science and practice, using real knowledge to replace belief in supernatural powers.

Copernicus's great discovery about the rotation of the earth not only greatly promoted the development of astronomy, but more importantly, it improved the possibility of mankind's understanding of the world, laid the foundation for a correct worldview, and thus opened up a new era for natural science.

Copernicus and his successors have always observed and understood the world with a critical eye and their own practice in order to explore and master objective truth. In the history of human culture, his name is incompatible with all reactionary obscurantism, brainwashing policies, superstition and blind obedience. Their scientific working methods and the revolutionary spirit of challenging reactionary forces in order to develop scientific knowledge are forever worthy of learning by all mankind.

Among the great warriors who fought for civilization and progress for mankind, we cannot forget the French humanist François Rabelais. If Copernicus was one of the vanguards who attacked feudal Western Europe in the Middle Ages from the scientific front, Rabelais was one of the vanguards who attacked from the literary front.

Rabelais, an outstanding satirical writer, bravely praised the heroic struggle of the progressive social forces in Western Europe against the dark feudal rule with his epic novel "Gargantua and Pantagruel." In this comprehensive masterpiece, which took twenty years to write, Rabelais used extensive life knowledge and extraordinary imagination to expose the social contradictions of feudal France, and outlined the prototypes of cold and despotic rulers, hypocritical hypocrites, and sham scholars. The grand realistic power of this work not only bombarded the ghosts of the Middle Ages like thunder at that time, but still radiates fresh brilliance even today. That kind of sharp satire of the aggressors makes today's peaceful humanity feel joy and encouragement as well.

As a smart and brave warrior, Rabelais was truly carefree and fearless, treating the enemy like grass. His "Gargantua and Pantagruel," the verdict of that era, sharply summarized the turbulent social situation at that time: on the one hand, the infighting of feudal princes, the tyranny of the Catholic Church, and the inevitable and disgraceful decline of these reactionary forces, and on the other hand, the suffering, sorrow, and joyful struggle incited by the resistance of the common people. Rabelais was not an observer of the times, his love and hate were very clear. He sharply satirized the invaders Anarche and Picrochole, the war instigator Friar John. The judge "who lived by eating children," "the cat king in a leather robe," and the coward who could only "scratch the back of his head" in front of the enemy; at the same time, he enthusiastically praised the embodiment of the noble people, the brave warrior Friar John and the "beggar at the jail gate," who represented the people in this work and bravely participated in the battle and defended their interests. Although in order to emphasize the character of the characters required by that era, the author borrowed astonishing exaggeration, the historical authenticity of the development was not damaged by these peculiar plots and styles at all, but was particularly prominent and persuasive.

Rabelais's opposition to the feudal social system went beyond the general concept of humanism. His beliefs and strength were directly rooted in the world of the common people. The origins of his heroes were "grass-cutters, threshers, warehouse keepers, pig breeders, lantern bearers, charcoal burners, horse drivers, packers, vegetable growers, as well as coppersmiths, gardeners, homeless vagrants, shepherds, barbers, ale brewers, and people who didn't even have shirts on their bodies." At the same time, Rabelais created portraits of heroic people with genius imagination and masterful generalization, pushing them to the stage of history and predicting their great future. In this way, this humanist warrior not only in literary writing, but actually in social struggle, placed himself in clear opposition to the feudal ruling class.

Rabelais, the great French realist writer, transcended his era and stood with us, participating in the new battle for justice. His contempt and hatred for combat and aggression mobilized even greater forces today; his predictions for the happy future of mankind have begun to be realized today.

Finally, we want to commemorate another respectable "apostle of freedom," Cuba's José Martí. In terms of the historical tasks he shouldered and the realistic significance of the struggles he engaged in, Martí is closer to us.

Martí grew up in Cuba, which was ruled by Spanish colonists, and personally experienced the oppression and humiliation of the colonists. At the age of sixteen, he was punished with forced labor for his patriotic revolutionary activities. However, the enthusiasm of the revolutionaries cannot be conquered. After repeated imprisonment and exile. Martí still insisted on the ideal of seeking liberation for the suffering Cuban nation, used writing and practical actions to launch the Cuban nation's revolutionary struggle for freedom and independence, and laid the foundation for the Cuban Revolutionary Party. Finally, in a Cuban war of liberation that he organized, he gloriously ended his entire life dedicated to the people. Although his career has not yet been fully realized today, his name has become a banner calling for struggle in the hearts of the Cuban people. His firm democratic spirit, his hatred and resistance to racial discrimination, his sharp insights into the aggressive nature of the developing American imperialism and the inherent contradictions of the capitalist system, his series of heroic struggles to support national freedom and national independence, oppose economic monopoly and military oppression... have profound significance for today's cause of peace and democracy, especially the glorious future of Latin America.

Like all humanitarian warriors, Martí affirmed the dignity of man. He said that it is noble to be a human being. He also said that if one cannot contribute to the happiness and tranquility of others, one cannot be called a human being. Because of this noble sentiment, he not only became a heroic revolutionary, but also a poet who fought for human progress.

Martí fully expressed his revolutionary character in his creative process. His poems are permeated with deep love for the people,狂烈 joy for the struggling life, and firm belief in victory. His poems are beautiful and popular. The people love this kind of poet, the people appreciate this kind of poet, and the people can always gain confidence and strength from his enthusiastic lines of poetry to resist injustice and strive for freedom. He himself proudly announced in the "Preface to the Book of Free Poems": "These poems were not written with academic ink, but with my blood." This precisely illustrates the essence of José Martí as a warrior fighting for true equality between nations, as an active supporter of human freedom and progress, and as a revolutionary poet with a pen in one hand and a gun in the other.

José Martí once said: "The future depends on peace," and this loud and combative call has been enthusiastically responded to by the people of the world today.

Qu Yuan, Copernicus, Rabelais, and José Martí, although their eras are different, the brilliance they have emitted in the history of human culture is as eternal and beautiful as the stars in the sky. Their precious cultural heritage has become the common wealth of all progressive mankind. Their common pursuit of truth, serving the people, and sacrificing themselves is always worthy of respect and promotion. In their lives and achievements, we deeply realize that the beautiful future of all mankind is the common goal pursued by outstanding cultural warriors of all nations from ancient times to the present. At the same time, we also deeply realize that respecting and carrying forward the excellent cultural traditions of all nations and promoting cultural exchange between all nations are indeed necessary conditions for enhancing understanding and friendship between nations, enriching and improving human culture, and striving for lasting world peace.

Therefore, today we commemorate Qu Yuan, Copernicus, Rabelais, and José Martí, we must connect it to the current situation of the world and culture. We cannot fail to see that the brutal tigers and wolves and the foxes and rats that bring disaster to the country and the people that Qu Yuan cursed, the persecutors of free thought that Copernicus attacked, the aggressors and war instigators that Rabelais satirized, and the national oppressors that Martí fought against with his life, especially that vulture that he deeply hated that tried to seize the whole world in its claws—are appearing in new guises today, engaging in their nefarious activities. These enemies of peace are inciting war everywhere, undermining the peace movement, and shamelessly obstructing the free development of all nations and economic and cultural exchanges, they hate human progress and freedom, persecute the consciences of artists and scientists, trample and destroy human culture, the material and cultural life of mankind is suffering serious challenges from war instigators.

The scum of the Chinese nation, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, under the protection of American imperialism, has never dared to mention the name of Qu Yuan, and has even banned the commemoration of Qu Yuan, because Qu Yuan's stern condemnation of traitors in his era is whipping the despicable bones of these scum. Under the rule of Nazi Germany, the Copernicus statue erected by the Polish people in the 19th century was demolished. The French bourgeoisie was afraid of touching Rabelais's sharp satire, like being afraid of hot chestnuts, so that they exclaimed in panic that they "had lost their meaning." Under the cowardly connivance of the rulers of Cuba, Martí's statue was insulted by American sailors. All these phenomena show that those who oppose the people must oppose culture. Those national scum who sell out national independence and national sovereignty are executing the will of gold dollars, on the one hand, attempting to eliminate the culture created by the people from libraries, museums, and the ground, and on the other hand, slavishly welcoming the decadent and reactionary American way of life, stifling the excellent cultural traditions of all nations, and depriving all nations of their self-esteem, so as to establish a bloody rule of gold dollars. However, the excellent cultural achievements of all nations cannot be destroyed after all, and the noble people's cultural traditions will inevitably last forever. Last year, the people of the world commemorated Hugo, da Vinci, Gogol, and Avicenna, this year, the people of the world are commemorating Qu Yuan, Copernicus, Rabelais, and José Martí again, and there will be similar commemorations year after year in the future, which is a powerful proof.

Today, the Korean armistice that the people of the world are concerned about has been realized, but it remains to be consolidated. War instigators are still trying to undermine the armistice at all times, obstruct the success of the political conference, and strengthen the threat to peace in other areas. Under such circumstances, we commemorate four great international cultural celebrities, we should further emphasize the close relationship between peace and culture. Defending world peace through cultural exchange has been an important task in the world peace movement for more than four years. However, the smooth mutual exchange of cultures of all nations, like the situation in economic exchange, can only be fully realized under peaceful conditions. If peace is threatened or even destroyed, cultural exchange and development will inevitably be hindered and trampled. Therefore, the struggle to defend peace and defend culture is inseparable. At this commemorative meeting, we have to appeal to the people of the world: concentrate the power of world public opinion to consolidate the Korean armistice, stop other current wars, and eliminate all war threats. We advocate strengthening cultural exchange between nations on an equal basis to promote mutual understanding and respect between nations, but at the same time, we firmly oppose the so-called "cosmopolitanism" and the disguised cultural aggression of using the American way of life to enslave the world. We advocate resolving all international disputes through peaceful negotiation, but we must oppose the conspiracy of war instigators who use the name of negotiation to propose some preconditions for negotiation, in an attempt to achieve the reality of undermining negotiation. This is the key to the struggle to defend lasting world peace and promote the excellent traditions of human culture today.

In their respective eras, Qu Yuan, Copernicus, Rabelais, and José Martí have brilliantly fulfilled their due obligations. They are immortal. Succeeding these great cultural pioneers and striving for the realization of lasting world peace and the greater prosperity of people's culture, this responsibility falls on our shoulders. Let us fight for the realization of people's friendship, free life, and lasting peace for all mankind with the same spirit of pursuing truth, serving the people, and sacrificing ourselves.

Long live the development of people's culture!
Long live peace!

    争取世界和平的胜利与人民文化的繁荣
    ——一九五三年九月二十七日在北京纪念四位世界文化名人大会上的演说
    郭沫若
    中国人民怀抱着和平胜利的信心和对于人类文化遗产的尊重，接受了世界和平理事会的建议，在今年一九五三年纪念四位伟大的国际文化名人，中国的屈原、波兰的尼古劳斯·哥白尼、法国的弗朗索瓦·拉伯雷和古巴的何塞·马蒂。
    这四位伟大的人类文化的贡献者和拥护者，他们是永垂不朽的。屈原死了虽然已经二千二百三十年，哥白尼死了四百一十年，拉伯雷死了四百年，何塞·马蒂如果还活着，也有了一百岁，但他们依然还活在世界人民的心里。他们虽然各自出生在不同的时代和不同的国度，他们却共同为着人类的正义和进步奋斗了一生，他们的创造性的劳动给人类文化增加了宝贵的遗产。他们的理想、他们的工作、他们的斗争，是和当时当地的人民的利益相联系的，从他们一生的特定的历史意义来考察，也是和世界人民当前的利益相联系的。
    去年我们纪念了雨果、达·芬奇、果戈里和阿维森纳，今年我们又纪念这四位伟大的文化人物，我们深切地体会到，世界人民有着充分的信心，为继承并发扬人类优秀的文化传统，而团结一致，使世界文化巨人们共同追求的崇高理想——人民友谊、自由生活与持久和平，能够有实现的可能。
    这个纪念会所要纪念的文化巨人，第一个是中国的屈原。
    屈原是中国第一个伟大的爱国诗人。他一生渴望自由和正义，热爱他的祖国和人民，憎恨腐败无能的统治阶级，最后用自己的生命殉葬了自己的理想。他的作品在中国文学发展史上发生了深远的影响，为后来的诗人们留下了光辉的楷模。两千多年来，他的诗篇中所表现的爱国热情，对于各个时代的读者一直产生着新的鼓舞力量。
    屈原生于纪元前三百四十年，中国历史上的“战国”时代，由春秋时代的十二个大国已经归并而为七个大国，相互斗争着想完成中国的统一。他生在长江流域的楚国，他希望楚国能够拯救人民的疾苦，来完成这项光荣的任务。屈原虽是楚国贵族的后裔，但由于他长期接近平民，深切地感受到民间的疾苦，因而有着正直的性格和进步的思想，他的作品是具有浓厚的人民性的。
    屈原热爱自己的祖国和人民。他不但在自己的作品中表现了强烈的政治倾向，同情人民的苦难，而且在他所担任的楚国“左徒”的职位上，他一直坚持着同情人民的开明的政治理想，他慕仰中国古代曾经为民造福的贤明的帝王，痛恨恣意享乐、猖狂自大的贵族集团，并主张取消贵族政制，广泛地任用贤能，振兴国家，改善民生。这种开明的政治思想，当然不能见容于追逐个人利益的楚国当权贵族。于是，在楚国的朝廷里，屈原和那些倒行逆施、胡作非为的贵族之间，发生了激烈的斗争。
    不幸，楚怀王是一个浅薄无定见、妄自尊大的庸君，他虽然曾经重用过一次屈原，但他不但没有采纳屈原的忠告，减轻人民的苦难，反而听信周围的宵小的谗言，逐渐疏远了并且终于放逐了他。此后二十多年，屈原在国内悲愤地过着流亡的生活，困顿到几乎不能忍受；但他爱恋着自己的乡土和人民，从不肯离开楚国一步。当楚怀王被反动贵族所包围，一味地骄奢淫逸，轻举妄动，以致在战国七国中版图最大、物产最丰富的楚国就衰败在他的手里，屈原的痛苦和忧虑是万分深切的。
    但不幸的遭遇和孤愤的心情，反而使屈原的文学天才开放出了空前未有的灿烂的繁花。在流放期间，他不断地用诗歌创作来体现他的崇高的理想。他的诗篇充满着磅礴的想像和晶莹的思想感情，表现了他的崇高的品质，激越的反抗精神和对于祖国和人民的深厚的爱。他的敌人们原来企图利用诽谤和陷害来将他的名字从人民的记忆中抹掉的，但是事实和他们的妄想恰恰相反：屈原，千古不朽的“离骚”的作者，不仅深深获得了楚国人民的同情，并和整个中国人民的光荣的文化传统永远分不开了。
    屈原既热爱他的祖国和人民，故当纪元前二七八年，楚怀王的儿子顷襄王的二十一年，秦国的大兵攻破了楚国的都城，并长驱南下，占领了长江以南洞庭湖一带区域的时候，屈原感觉到楚国前途的绝望，终于跳进湖南境内的汨罗江里，结束了他的悲剧的一生。正直的屈原在政治斗争中是失败了。他的失败几千年来一直引起人民的同情和崇敬。显然，这种同情和崇敬，主要地是由于他对于祖国和人民的真诚的爱，对于理想的追求，和坚持不屈的人格和操守。屈原在文学上的成就，正在于他的诗篇完满地表现出这些高贵的品质，从而达到思想性和艺术性的高度的统一。
    屈原的诗篇是中国古典文学遗产中的怀宝，是中国人民对于人类文化的巨大贡献之一。屈原在文学创作中所表现的人民性和爱国精神，在我们所生活的时代，已经赋予了新的意义，并取得了战胜罪恶势力的充沛的力量。
    今天，我们还要纪念波兰的尼古劳斯·哥白尼，这位现代自然科学的先驱。在人类对于客观真理的探求过程中，哥白尼是一个里程碑式的存在。
    在四百多年以前的欧洲，中世纪的封建统治势力，利用奴婢的烦琐哲学，给人类的思想建立了黑暗的牢狱。但人类的思想是怎么也监禁不住的，它必须沿着社会发展史的道路前进。当新兴的市民阶级带领着农民和最初的无产阶级，开始向中世纪的封建经济基础进攻的时候，在西欧文化史上出现了文艺复兴时代，就是那个“需要巨人的时代”。在那些和腐臭的中世纪文化相搏斗的生龙活虎一般的英雄们中间，哥白尼是自然科学界中最为出色的一个。
    像当时那些不受分工限制的“完人”们一样，哥白尼是多才多艺，学识广博的。他是卓越的数学家，是著名的经济学家，是有威望的医生，他通晓力学和地形测量，熟悉拉丁文、希腊文和一切古代艺术；他还是一位画家，一位社会活动家。然而，使他的名字永垂不朽的，是他在天文学上的伟大的贡献。他的具有世界历史意义的巨著“天体运行”，冲破了中世纪的神学的牢狱，使人类理智得到解放，宣布了科学的胜利。
    在欧洲，从亚里士多德起，人类对于地球在天空中的特殊地位，原有着深固的信仰。希腊天文学家托伦梅的“地球中心说”或“天动说”，就是这种信仰的基础。这种错误的学说对于巩固神权观念和封建专制是有利的，因而中世纪的封建势力全力支持这种虚伪的科学，利用它来证实世界是一成不变的，世界的统治权力也是一成不变的，这样来为中世纪的封建统治阶级撑腰，以便于向人民继续进行奴役。但是，随着社会生产力的发展，真理是不能长久被掩埋住的。哥白尼经过将近四十年的辛苦的研究，终于发现了托伦梅的错误所在，揭穿了封建统治阶级的罪恶伎俩，用新的关于世界的概念代替了“地球中心说”和“人类中心说”。凭着科学所给予的勇气，他向当时黑暗的统治势力挑战了：“地球不是宇宙的中心，仅只是许多行星中间的一个，和它们一起绕着太阳公转，并且绕着自己的轴而自转。”在人类的思想不能超越圣经一步的时代，哥白尼的这样大胆的宣布，当然是一种重大的革命行动，它不但用客观真理和主观臆说直接地相对抗，并且由于使人类开始懂得用科学和实践、用真正的知识代替了对超自然力量的信仰。
    哥白尼的关于地球运转的伟大发现，不仅大大地推动了天文学的发展，更重要的是提高了人类认识世界的可能性，为正确的宇宙观奠定了基础，从而给自然科学开辟了新时代。
    哥白尼和他的继承者们，为了探求和掌握客观真理，一直是用批判的眼光，用自己的实践来观察世界和认识世界的。在人类文化史上，他的名字和一切反动的蒙昧主义、愚民政策、迷信和盲从是势不两立的。他们的科学的工作方法，为了开展科学知识而向反动势力挑战的革命精神，永远值得全人类学习。
    在为人类争取文明和进步的伟大战士中间，我们不能忘记法国人文主义者弗朗索瓦·拉伯雷，如果说哥白尼是从科学阵地进攻西欧封建中世纪的先锋之一，拉伯雷便是从文学阵地进攻的先锋之一。
    拉伯雷，杰出的讽刺作家，用他的史诗一般的长篇小说“巨人与巨人之子”勇敢地礼赞了中世纪的西欧进步社会力量向黑暗封建统治进攻的英雄斗争。在这部用二十年时间写成的包罗万象的巨著中，拉伯雷用渊博的生活知识、奇绝的想像暴露了封建法兰西的社会矛盾，勾画出阴冷的专制统治者、假仁假义的伪君子、冒充的学者们的原形。这部著作的宏大的现实主义力量，不仅在当时像雷霆一样轰击了中世纪的幽灵，就一直到今天也仍然放射着新鲜的光彩。那种对于侵略者的辛辣的讽刺，使今天的和平人类也一样感受到喜悦和鼓舞。
    作为一个聪明而勇敢的战士，拉伯雷真是无所顾虑，无所畏惧，把敌人看作草芥一样。他的“巨人和巨人之子”，那个时代的判决书，尖锐地总结了当时动乱不安的社会情况：一方面是封建王侯的火并，天主教会的专横和这些反动势力的必然的可耻的没落，另一方面则是平民的苦难、悲哀和反抗斗争所激起的欢喜。拉伯雷不是时代的旁观者，他的爱憎是十分鲜明的。他一针见血地讽刺了侵略者阿那尔赫和毕可肖、战争挑拨者米田共。“靠吃小孩过活”的法官“穿皮袍的猫王”，以及在敌人面前只能“搔搔后脑”的懦夫；同时又热情地颂扬了崇高的人民的化身，杀敌勇士约翰修士和“牢城口乞丐”，他们在这部作品中代表着人民勇敢的参加了战斗，并且保卫住自己的利益。虽然为了强调那个时代所要求的人物的性格，作者借用了惊人的夸张手法，但历史发展的真实性却丝毫没有被这些奇特的情节和风格所损害，反而显得分外地凸出和富有说服力。
    拉伯雷反对封建社会制度，是超越了一般的人文主义概念的。他的信念和力量直接生根在平民世界里面。他的英雄们的出身就是“刈草的、打谷的、管仓库的、养猪的、提灯的、烧炭的、赶马的、包装的、种菜的以及铜匠、园丁、无家可归的流浪汉、牧人、理发师、酿造麦酒的、身上连衬衫都没有的人们。”同时，拉伯雷以天才的想像和巨匠的概括创造出英勇人民的肖像，把他们推到历史的舞台口，预言了他们的伟大的未来。这样，这位人文主义战士就不仅是在文学写作中，而且实际上是在社会斗争中，将自己和封建统治阶级处于鲜明的对立的地位。
    拉伯雷，伟大的法兰西现实主义作家，超越了他的时代，和我们站在一起，参加了新的正义的战斗。他对于战斗和侵略的轻蔑和憎恨，在今天动员了更强大的力量；他对于人类的幸福未来的预言，在今天已经开始取得实现。
    我们最后要纪念另一位可尊敬的“自由的使徒”，古巴的何塞·马蒂。在他所肩负的时代任务上，在他所从事的斗争的现实意义上，马蒂是更为接近我们的。
    马蒂是在西班牙殖民者所统治的古巴长大的，亲身经受过殖民者的压迫和侮辱。十六岁，他就因为爱国的革命活动而受到强迫劳动的惩罚。但是，革命者的热情是不能够征服的。经过一再的监禁和流放。马蒂仍然坚持着为痛苦的古巴民族求解放的理想，用写作和实际行动发动了古巴民族争取自由和独立的革命斗争，为古巴革命党奠定了基础。最后在他所组织的一次古巴解放战争中，他光荣地结束了他的全部献给人民的一生。虽然他的事业到今天还没有得到完满的实现，他的名字在古巴人民的心中却已成为一面号召斗争的旗帜。他的坚定的民主精神，他的对于种族歧视的憎恨和反抗，他的对于发展中的美帝国主义的侵略本质和资本主义制度内在矛盾的犀利透视，他的拥护民族自由和民族独立，反对经济垄断和军事压迫的一系列的英勇斗争……对于今天的和平民主事业特别是拉丁美洲的光荣的前途，具有着深切的意义。
    像一切人道主义战士一样，马蒂肯定着人的尊严。他说过，作一个人是高尚的。他又说过，如果不能对旁人的幸福和安宁有所贡献，谁就不能称为一个人。由于具有这种崇高的情操，他不但成为英勇的革命家，而且成为一个为人类进步而战斗的诗人。
    马蒂在他的创作过程中充分地表现了他的革命家的本色。他的诗浸透了对于人民的深厚的爱，对于斗争生活的狂烈的喜悦，对于胜利的坚决的信仰。他的诗是优美的同时也是通俗的。人民喜爱这种诗人，人民感激这种诗人，人民永远能够从他的热情充沛的诗行中间获得信心和力量，来反抗不义，争取自由。他自己在他的“自由诗集的序言”中曾骄傲地宣布过：“这些诗不是用学院派的墨水，而是用我的血写成的。”这正说明了作为争取民族间的真正平等而奋斗的战士，作为人类的自由和进步的积极拥护者，作为一只手提笔另一只手拿枪的革命诗人，何塞·马蒂的本质。
    何塞·马蒂又曾经说过：“未来决定于和平，”他这种宏亮的战斗的呼声，在今天更得到了全世界人民的热情的响应了。
    屈原、哥白尼、拉伯雷和何塞·马蒂，他们的时代虽然不同，但他们在人类文化史上所放出的光彩，却像天上的群星一样永恒而美丽。他们的宝贵的文化遗产已成为全体进步人类的共同财富。他们所共通的追求真理，服务人民和牺牲自我的精神永远值得尊敬和发扬。在他们的生活和业绩中我们深切地体会到。全世界人类美好的未来是古今来各民族的优秀的文化战士所共同争取的目标。同时，我们也深切地体会到，尊重和发扬各民族优良的文化传统，促进各民族文化的交流，确实是增进民族间的了解和友谊、丰富和提高人类文化、争取世界持久和平的一项必要条件。
    因此，今天我们纪念屈原、哥白尼、拉伯雷和何塞·马蒂，就必须联系到世界人类和文化目前所遭遇到的情况。我们不能不看到，屈原所咀咒的残暴的虎狼与祸国殃民的狐鼠，哥白尼所攻击的自由思想的迫害者，拉伯雷所讽刺的侵略者和战争挑拨者，马蒂用生命与之相搏斗的民族压迫者，尤其是他所深恶痛绝的那匹企图将全世界攫在它的爪子里的秃鹰——在今天，以新的面貌出现着，进行着它们的鬼蜮活动。这些和平的敌人到处挑拨战争，破坏和平运动，而且无耻地阻挠各民族的自由发展和经济与文化的交流，它们仇恨人类的进步和自由，迫害艺术家和科学家的良心，践踏和毁灭人类的文化，人类的物质生活与文化生活正遭受着战争挑拨者的严重的挑战。
    中国民族的败类，蒋介石匪帮在美帝国主义的卵翼下面，从来不敢提到屈原的名字，并曾经禁止过对于屈原的纪念，因为屈原在他的时代对于卖国贼的严正的呵斥正鞭打着这些败类的卑贱的骨头。在纳粹德国统治下面，波兰人民在十九世纪树立起来的哥白尼铜像被拆毁了。法国资产阶级害怕触到拉伯雷的辛辣的讽刺，像害怕火栗一样，以致慌张地叫嚷着它们“已失掉了意义”。在古巴统治者的懦怯的纵容下，马蒂的铜像则受到了美国水兵的侮辱。这一切现象说明：反对人民的，就必然反对文化。那些出卖民族独立和民族主权的民族败类正执行着金元的旨意，一方面企图把人民创造的文化从图书馆、博物馆和地面上消灭掉，另一方面则奴颜婢膝地迎接着堕落的反动的美国生活方式，扼杀各民族的优秀文化传统，剥夺各民族的自尊心，以便于建立金元的血腥统治。但是，各民族的优秀文化成就毕竟是不能毁灭的，尊贵的人民文化传统必然永存。去年，全世界人民纪念了雨果、达· 芬奇、果戈里和阿维森纳，今年，全世界人民又在纪念屈原、哥白尼、拉伯雷和何塞·马蒂，今后年年岁岁都将会有同样的纪念，就是一个有力的证明。
    今天，全世界人民所关心的朝鲜停战已经实现了，但还有待于巩固。战争挑拨者还时时刻刻企图破坏停战，阻挠政治会议的成功，并在别的区域加强对于和平的威胁。在这样情况下，我们纪念四位伟大的国际文化名人，我们还应该更进一步强调和平与文化的密切关系。通过文化交流来保卫世界和平，是四年多来世界和平运动中的一项重要的任务。但是各民族文化的顺畅的相互交流，就和经济交流方面的情形一样，要在和平的条件下才有充分的实现可能。如果和平遭受到威胁或甚至破坏，文化的交流和发展就一定会受到阻碍和蹂躏。因此，保卫和平和保卫文化的斗争是分不开的。我们在这个纪念会上就不得不向全世界人民呼吁：集中世界舆论的力量来巩固朝鲜停战，停止其它现行战争，消灭一切的战争威胁。我们主张加强在平等的基础上各民族文化的交流，以促进各民族间的相互谅解和尊重，但我们同时坚决反对所谓“世界主义”以美国的生活方式来奴役世界的变相的文化侵略。我们主张用和平协商的方式解决一切的国际争端，但我们必须反对假借协商之名，提出一些谈判的先决条件，以企图收到破坏协商之实的战争挑拨者的阴谋。这就是在今天保卫世界持久和平和发扬人类文化优良传统的斗争关键之所在。
    在各自的时代，屈原、哥白尼、拉伯雷和何塞·马蒂已经辉煌地完成了他们应尽的义务。他们是永垂不朽的。接替这些伟大的文化先驱者，争取世界持久和平的实现和人民文化的更加繁荣，这个责任落在我们的身上了。让我们以同样的追求真理、服务人民和牺牲自我的精神，为实现全人类的人民友谊、自由生活与持久和平而斗争。
    人民文化发展万岁！
    和平万岁！
