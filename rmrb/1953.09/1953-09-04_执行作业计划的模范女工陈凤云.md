    Model Woman Worker Chen Fengyun Executes Work Plan
    Chen Fengyun, an advanced worker in the external grinding team of the Second Mechanical Workshop of the Dalian Machine Tool Factory (formerly Machinery Factory No. 18), executes the work plan with exemplary proactive actions. She not only achieves a balanced and exceeding monthly, weekly, and daily completion of planned tasks, ensuring product quality, but also actively assists workshop cadres and workers in improving shortcomings in plan management, promoting the advancement of plan management work.
    Chen Fengyun was originally a housewife. After joining the factory at the beginning of last year, she continuously improved her class consciousness under the education of the Party and progressed rapidly. In March of this year, she became a glorious Communist Party member. After the factory strengthened its plan management work, she further realized that all national work is carried out according to plans. The work of each person and each unit is part of the entire national plan. If a person does not work according to their plan, it will disrupt the plans of the team, the section, and the workshop. If the workshop's plan cannot be completed, it will be difficult to complete the factory's plan. If the factory cannot complete the plan, the national plan will be disrupted, just like a small part being damaged, causing the entire machine tool to stop running. If everyone works blindly and chaotically, how can the country smoothly carry out construction? How can we quickly embark on socialism? Therefore, she made up her mind: she must execute the plan like obeying national laws.
    When she receives the individual weekly work plan assigned to her by the workshop, she first carefully reviews whether the plan content is practical and whether the entire task meets the requirements of the machine tool's load, and whether there are any errors or omissions. Once she discovered that the plan mistakenly scheduled a small set of small shafts that should be done on a small lathe on a large lathe, and there was another shaft scheduled on the large lathe that she had never done before and did not know if the plan was appropriate. She went to the drawing room to inquire and learned that it was scheduled incorrectly, so she immediately found the planner to correct it. There was also a batch of shafts that had already been sent, but were not on the plan, so she immediately asked the foreman to add them. Every time she discovers that there are errors in the plan, she can promptly offer suggestions for correction.
    When the team discusses the work plan, Chen Fengyun always considers the planned man-hours realistically, actively uses her brain, and thinks of ways to improve work efficiency in order to create more wealth for the country. Once, when discussing the plan, Kong Lianfeng said, "The plan gives twenty-two minutes to make a small shaft, which cannot be done." Chen Fengyun first did a trial run, and completed it in fourteen minutes. She introduced the actual man-hours and operating methods to everyone, and Kong Lianfeng had nothing to say. When discussing the plan, she carefully studies what jigs and tools are needed for each type of work and promptly raises them to the leading cadres to ensure that the plan is not affected. In this way, in June and July, she completely eliminated the interrupted man-hours of waiting for tools.
    Chen Fengyun studied the past implementation of the plan and found that the main factor disrupting the plan was downtime, and the reason for downtime was often that production preparation work was not done well. Therefore, in order to ensure the realization of the plan, she always arrives at the factory early every day and fully prepares for production: familiarizes herself with the drawings, checks micrometers and jigs, and contacts the foreman and dispatcher to prepare the work, and adds oil to the machine tool. In this way, she can start working as soon as she goes to work every day, ensuring that she does not run around all day and proceeds with production smoothly. In order not to affect the completion of the plan, she always contacts the foreman or dispatcher when a batch of work is not finished, urging them to quickly prepare the next batch of work so that she can take over and work without wasting time. Once, when she was about to finish a batch of shafts, she asked the foreman to prepare the next batch of work immediately. The foreman went to the lathe of the previous process and saw that two batches of seventy-four shafts were still lying on the ground, none of which had been made. Seeing that Chen Fengyun was about to stop work, she asked the foreman to immediately revise the plan, change a batch of work for her to do, and indicate the reason for the modification in the original planned task to alert the foreman and dispatcher to pay attention to strengthening the dispatching work. Chen Fengyun strictly demands herself and must complete the plan on time, so if there are any difficulties, she always tries her best to overcome them. Once, an apprentice who changed shifts with her only completed four hours of the quota in eight hours. Seeing that the plan was about to be disrupted, she seized every second after taking over and finally caught up with the apprentice's task and completed the day's plan. Because she has a high sense of responsibility for the national plan, she is also very concerned about whether others are working according to the plan, and if she finds any phenomena of picking and choosing work or not implementing the plan, she will criticize them unceremoniously. With her help, the workers in the external grinding team now all work strictly according to the plan.
    Although Chen Fengyun always overfulfills her plan, she is not satisfied with the status quo and often looks for tricks to improve production further. She considered: the lathe implements high-speed cutting, and the work is done faster. If our grinding machine can't keep up, the workers in other groups are wasting their efforts. We must find a way to keep up with them so that the workshop's production can be comprehensively improved! After repeated deliberation, she finally came up with the "fast grinding method" of leg-on-knife and hand-held work, which combines hand and leg movements, shortening the time for grinding a shaft from two minutes to thirty-four seconds. After the team promoted her advanced experience, although the work-hour quota was generally reduced by 30 percent, everyone could still overfulfill their plan. Chen Fengyun often considers the overall interests, so she automatically asks to do supplementary work, short-line work, and work with particularly precise quality that others are unwilling to do.
    Defective products are the biggest obstacle to completing the plan. Chen Fengyun deeply understands this. In order to ensure product quality, she insists on implementing the system of stamping the first part with an inspection mark. During the operation, she frequently checks the micrometer and the parts with inspection marks, and actively contacts the inspector to ask the inspector to spot-check the jigs and parts. In this way, her defective product man-hours often do not exceed five per thousand. When she sees others producing defective products, she feels as heartbroken as if she had made them herself. Therefore, she strictly implements the spot-check system and often educates others: Don't just focus on quantity and disregard quality, causing waste to the country! Especially for apprentices with low technical skills, she has to explain three or four times for each piece of work, and constantly spot-checks them, so the defective products made by her apprentices are also decreasing.
    In order to complete the national plan, she strictly abides by labor discipline. Except for once when her child was seriously ill and she took a few days off, she has not taken a single day off in a year and a half. The machine she uses is also well maintained. Except for normal wear and tear that needs to be repaired, it has never had an accident.
    Chen Fengyun also attaches great importance to original records, and she is very concerned about the accuracy of the records. Not only does she report the exact time to the recorder every time she finishes a batch of work, but she also helps the recorder to record the records accurately. Once, she found that the recorder had reversed the man-hours of two jobs, so she immediately asked the recorder to correct it. She believes that only when the records are accurate can accurate plans be made, and potential strengths can be continuously brought into play.
    Because Chen Fengyun resolutely implements the work plan with the responsible attitude of the master of the country, the employees of the Dalian Machine Tool Factory now call her "the model for executing the work plan."

    执行作业计划的模范女工陈凤云
    大连机床厂（原机械十八厂）第二机械车间外磨小组先进工人陈凤云，以模范的积极行动执行作业计划，不仅自己做到了按月、按周、按日均衡、超额地完成计划任务，保证产品质量，还积极帮助车间干部、工人改进计划管理缺点，推动了计划管理工作的前进。
    陈凤云原来是家庭妇女，去年年初进该厂工作以后，在党的教育下不断提高阶级觉悟，进步很快，今年三月，她就成为光荣的共产党员了。工厂里加强计划管理工作开始以后，她进一步认识到国家的任何工作都是有计划地进行的。每个人、每个单位的工作，都是整个国家计划的一部分。要是一个人不按照自己的计划工作，就会打乱小组、工段、车间的计划，车间的计划不能完成，工厂的计划也很难完成，工厂不能完成计划，国家计划就会被打乱，就像一个小零件损坏了，使得整个机床停止转动一样。要是每个人都盲目乱干，国家怎么能够顺利进行建设？怎么能够很快走上社会主义呢？于是她下了决心：一定要像遵守国家法律一样来执行计划。
    她接到车间交给她的个人周作业计划时，首先就认真地审查计划内容是否切合实际，考虑整个任务符不符合机床负荷的要求，有没有错漏的地方。有一次她发现计划上把一份应当排在小床上干的小套小轴，错排在大床上，还有一份排在大床上的轴她过去没干过，不知道计划排得合不合适，她就到图纸房打听，知道是排错了，她便马上找计划员把它改正过来。还有一批轴已经送来了，计划上却没有，她就立刻请工长补充上去。她每次发现计划有编错的地方，都能及时提出意见修正。
    小组讨论作业计划时，陈凤云总是实事求是地考虑计划工时，积极开动脑筋，想办法提高工作效率，以便为国家创造更多财富。有次讨论计划，孔莲凤说：“小轴计划给二十二分钟干一个，干不出来。”陈凤云就先干一个活作试验，结果十四分钟就完成了。她把实际工时和操作方法向大家作了介绍，孔莲凤没有话说了。在讨论计划时，她认真研究每种活需要用什么胎具、工具，及时向领导干部提出来，以便保证计划不受影响。这样，在六七月份，她就完全消灭了等工具的间断工时。
    陈凤云研究了过去执行计划的情况，发现打乱计划的主要因素是间断时间，而造成间断时间的原因，往往是生产准备工作没有做好。因此，为了保证计划的实现，她每天总是提前到工厂，充分做好生产准备工作：熟悉图纸，检查千分尺和胎具，联系工长、调度员准备好活，在机床里加油。这样，她每天一上班就可以动手干活，保证一天不乱跑，顺利进行生产。为了不影响计划完成，她总是在一批活还没干完时，就联系工长或调度员，催他们赶紧给准备下一批活，以便接手就干，不浪费时间。有次她快干完一批轴，要求工长立刻准备下一批活，工长到上道工序的车床上去一看，两批共七十四个轴还撩在地上，一个也没干出来，陈凤云眼看要停工，就请工长立刻修改计划，换一批活给她干，并在原来的计划任务上，注明修改的原因，以引起工长、调度员的警惕，注意加强调度工作。陈凤云严格要求自己，必须按时完成计划，因此有什么困难，她总是想尽办法加以克服。有次和她换班的一个徒工，八小时只完成四小时的定额，眼看计划要被打乱，她接班以后，就抓紧每一秒钟时间，终于把徒工的任务撵了出来，完成了当天的计划。由于她对国家计划有高度的责任心，她也非常关心别人是否按照计划干活，发现有挑活干、不执行计划的现象，就不客气地提出批评。在她帮助下，外磨小组工人现在都严格地按照计划进行工作。
    陈凤云虽然总是超额完成自己的计划，但她并不满足现状，还是经常找窍门，力求把生产更提高一步。她考虑到：车床实行高速切削，活干得更快了，要是咱们磨床跟不上，别组工人也是白费劲，总得想法跟上他们，使车间生产全面提高！经过再三琢磨，她终于想出了腿上刀、手拤活——手腿联合动作的“快速磨活法”，使磨一根轴的时间从二分钟缩短到三十四秒钟。小组推广她的先进经验以后，虽然工时定额普遍降低了百分之三十，每个人还都能超额完成自己的计划。陈凤云经常考虑到整体利益，因此，别人不愿干的补数活、短线活、质量特别精密的活，她都自动要求给她干。
    废品是完成计划的最大障碍。陈凤云深深体会到这点。为了保证产品质量，她坚持执行第一个活打检印的制度。在操作过程中，按检印活勤对千分尺、勤量活，并经常主动和检查员联系，请检查员抽查胎具和活。这样，她的废品工时，经常不超过千分之五。她看见别人产生了废品，也和自己干了废品一样感觉心痛，因此她严格执行抽查制度，经常教育别人：不要只图数量，不顾质量，给国家造成浪费！特别对技术水平低的徒工，干一件活总要给讲解三四次，还不断去抽查，因此她带的徒工，废品也越来越少。
    为了完成国家计划，她严格遵守劳动纪律，除了有一次孩子生重病请了几天假外，一年半以来从没歇过一天工。她使用的机器也保养得很好，除了正常的磨损须进行修理外，也从没出过一次事故。
    陈凤云对原始记录也很重视，她很关心记录的准确性。她不仅每干完一批活，就把准确的时间报告记录员，还帮助记录员把记录记准。有次她发现记录员把两份活的工时记颠倒了，就立刻叫记录员改正。她认为：记录记准了，才能订出准确的计划来，潜在力量才能不断发挥。
    由于陈凤云以国家主人翁的负责态度，坚决贯彻作业计划，大连机床厂的职工们现在都称呼她是“执行作业计划的模范”。
