    东巴基斯坦各界人民
    举行反帝国主义斗争日
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社喀喇蚩九日讯：据巴基斯坦报纸报道：“东巴基斯坦人民回教联盟”主席毛拉纳·巴沙尼和“人民回教联盟”喀喇蚩支部主席马茂德—乌哈克·乌斯曼，号召巴基斯坦居民在九月十一日举行“反对帝国主义斗争日”。
    这个号召获得居民的广泛响应，而且获得除了回教联盟以外的所有政治党派和各团体的支持。东巴基斯坦共产党组织、“自由巴基斯坦”党喀喇蚩支部、喀喇蚩市工会委员会和银行职员工会，纷纷号召巴基斯坦人民抗议帝国主义国家对中东国家的罪恶活动。
    东巴基斯坦共产党组织说，它将参加举行“反对帝国主义斗争日”，并号召一切进步的组织、团体和个人联合起来，结成反对帝国主义的统一阵线。“自由巴基斯坦”党喀喇蚩支部的声明说：“帝国主义国家使尽一切阴谋诡计，以保持他们在被奴役的国家的统治。伊朗的摩萨台政府是被借着美国的帮助而推翻的。法国和美国串通一气，竭力压制摩洛哥和突尼斯的自由的声音。”
