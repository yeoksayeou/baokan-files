    Strengthen the Leadership of the Electricity Sector over Overhaul Work
    A common shortcoming in China's power industry at present is that power generation and supply are not safe enough, and accidents occur constantly. In March of this year, a boiler wall tube explosion occurred at a power plant in Taiyuan, stopping power supply for seven hours, forcing the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's blast furnace to stop production, causing great losses. In April, the Jilin Power Plant cut off power to the local paper mill six times in a row, disrupting the paper mill's production order and reducing the factory's paper production by more than 100 tons in one month. Other units such as the Fushun Power Plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and the Tianjin No. 1 Plant also experienced similar accidents in the first half of this year. There are many reasons for these accidents, but the general reason is that the machine overhaul work of these power departments is not done well, the overhaul quality is very low, some hidden accidents in the machine equipment have not been discovered and corrected in time during the overhaul, and the equipment that should be repaired and improved has not been dealt with in time during the overhaul. For example, the third power plant of the Xiangzhong Electric Power Bureau has experienced five furnace beam fracture accidents in succession last year and this year. The last time it happened was after they had just carried out the overhaul work, and the machine only ran for eight hours.
    Why is the quality of machine overhaul work in power plants in various places not good? This is because the leading cadres of the electric power bureaus and power plants in various places do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of overhaul work, and have not fully realized that high-quality regular overhaul is one of the important conditions for ensuring safe and economical operation and fully completing the plan. Therefore, they did not fully prepare for the overhaul, such as establishing a sound overhaul work headquarters and various necessary organizations (such as security organizations, acceptance organizations, etc.); carefully formulating a comprehensive and meticulous overhaul plan; according to the overhaul data files of the last overhaul, the equipment defect records submitted by the operation personnel, accident records, technical security records, etc., compiling practical overhaul items without omissions; formulating construction cards according to the projects (including the construction requirements of each project and detail, the main materials required, spare parts and their specifications, the person in charge and man-hour standards, etc.), and fully preparing various spare parts, materials and tools, etc. In the overhaul process, they one-sidedly pursue "fast speed", are careless, do not carry out overhaul according to technical standards, and arbitrarily reduce items. After the overhaul, they do not seriously carry out acceptance according to strict acceptance system, nor do they make records. For example, in the acceptance documents of the overhaul of Fushun Power Plant, most of the items are not signed by anyone in charge, and it is not known whether segment acceptance has been carried out; the overhaul record cards are abolished in disguise, and it is impossible to verify whether the overhaul meets the technical requirements.
    The power industry is an important part of China's industrial construction, and it is closely related to the production of countless factories and mines and the lives of the people. Once the machines of the power plant stop, the machines of countless factories will be forced to stop production. In industries such as metallurgy, chemical industry, and coal mining, even terrible and malicious accidents may occur. Therefore, the main task of the electric power sector is to ensure safe power generation and transmission. The key link in doing this work well is to effectively improve the quality of overhaul work and shorten the time for overhaul work. All employees of the electric power sector must seriously and earnestly treat this work and earnestly correct the shortcomings in the overhaul work.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the overhaul work, the following issues need special attention at present: First, we must strengthen quality education for overhaul personnel and improve their political consciousness and sense of responsibility. Second, we must fully prepare for the overhaul. We must establish a formal overhaul system and a responsibility system in the overhaul work. We must strengthen the replenishment and sorting of spare parts and the supply of materials, and strive to unify the overhaul time with other enterprises to reduce the loss of equipment utilization rate. Third, the leaders of electric power departments in various places should attach importance to the work of cultivating technical employees, improve their technical level, and strengthen the overhaul force. In recent years, due to the development of basic construction work, many technicians and skilled workers have been transferred to support basic construction. A large number of apprentices and interns have been added to the production department, and the technical force has been relatively weakened. However, the technical problems that need to be solved in the overhaul require higher and higher technical knowledge. Under this circumstance, the work of cultivating new technical forces has become an important work and also an important link to improve the overhaul quality in the future. This point must be given due attention. Finally, it is necessary to earnestly study and promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the successful experience of various bureaus and factories in overhaul work, such as the mechanization of overhaul, the improvement of tools, the improvement of technology, and organizational leadership. Launch a movement to improve the quality of overhaul among employees. The experience of Tangshan Power Plant in strengthening technical management is worthy of study and reference by electric power departments in various places. In short, as long as these tasks are done earnestly, the quality of overhaul work can be improved, and the safe power transmission can be further guaranteed.

### 加强电业部门对检修工作的领导

    加强电业部门对检修工作的领导
    我国电力工业目前的一个普遍缺点，是发电供电不够安全，事故不断发生。今年三月，太原某电厂锅炉墙管发生爆炸，停止供电七小时，使太原钢铁厂的高炉被迫停止生产，造成了极大的损失。四月，吉林发电厂对当地的造纸厂连续停电六次，打乱了造纸厂的生产秩序，使该厂在一个月内减产纸一百多吨。其他如抚顺发电厂、石景山发电厂、天津一厂等单位，在今年上半年也曾发生类似事故。造成这些事故的原因很多，但普遍的是这些电业部门的机器检修工作做得不好，检修质量很低，机器设备中的一些隐形事故没有在检修中被及时发现和纠正，应该加以修理和改进的设备也没有在检修中及时处理。例如湘中电业局的第三发电厂，去年和今年连续发生了五次炉梁断裂事故，最后一次是在他们刚刚进行了检修工作，机器只运转了八小时之后发生的。
    为什么各地发电厂机器检修工作的质量不好呢？这是因为各地电业局和发电厂的领导干部对检修工作的重要性认识不足，没有充分了解到质量优良的定期检修是保证安全经济运转全面完成计划的重要条件之一。因此，在检修前没有充分做好准备工作，例如建立健全的检修工作指挥部和各种必须的组织（如保安组织、验收组织等）；认真制订全面与周密的检修计划；根据上次检修的资料文件、运行人员提出的设备缺陷纪录、事故纪录、技术保安纪录等，编制切合实际的无遗漏的检修项目；按项目制订施工卡片（包括各项目和细目的施工要求，所需主要材料，备品及其规格，负责人及工时标准等），以及充分准备各项备品、材料和工具等等。而在检修过程中，则片面追求“快速”，粗枝大叶，不按技术标准进行检修，随便削减项目。在检修之后，又不认真按照严格的验收制度进行验收，也不作记录。如抚顺发电厂检修的验收文件，大部项目无人签署负责，不知是否进行过分段验收；检修纪录卡片无形中废除，检修是否符合技术要求也无从查考。
    电力工业是我国工业建设工作中的一个重要组成部分，它和无数工厂矿山的生产以及人民的生活有着密切的关系。发电厂的机器一停，无数工厂的机器都将随着被迫停止生产，在冶金、化学、煤矿等工业里，甚至可能酿成可怕的恶性事故。因此，电业部门的主要任务，就是要保证安全发电和送电，而作好这一工作的关键环节，就是切实提高检修工作的质量，并缩短检修工作的时间。电业部门的全体职工，都必须认真严肃地对待这项工作，切实纠正检修工作中的缺点。
    为了加强对检修工作的领导，目前特别需要注意如下几个问题：一、要对检修人员加强质量教育，提高他们的政治觉悟和责任心。二、充分做好检修的准备工作，要建立正规的检修制度和检修工作中的责任制，要加强备品备件的补充与整理工作和材料供应工作，并力求作到与其他企业统一检修的时间，以减少设备利用率的损失。三、各地电业部门领导上要重视培养技术员工的工作，提高他们的技术水平，壮大检修力量。近年来由于基本建设工作的展开，不少技术人员和熟练工人被抽调去支援基本建设，生产部门中补入了大批学徒工和实习员，技术力量是相对减弱了，而检修中所需要解决的技术问题却日益要求较高的技术知识，在这种情况下，培养新的技术力量的工作就成为一个重要工作，也是今后提高检修质量的一个重要环节，这点必须予以应有的重视。最后，就是要认真学习与推广苏联先进经验及各局厂在检修工作上的成功经验，如检修的机械化、工具的改善、技术的改进及组织领导等等。在职工中展开提高检修质量的运动。唐山发电厂加强技术管理的经验，值得各地电业部门的学习和参考。总之，只要认真地做好这些工作，检修工作的质量就可能提高，安全送电就可以有进一步的保证。
