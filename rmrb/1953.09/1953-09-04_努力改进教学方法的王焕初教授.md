    Professor Wang Huanchu Strives to Improve Teaching Methods
    Northwest Institute of Technology Academic Affairs Office
    Professor Wang Huanchu, Director of the Mathematics Teaching and Research Office at Northwest Institute of Technology, has achieved good results in learning from advanced Soviet experiences to improve teaching methods. Students are generally satisfied with his teaching. We conducted a teaching effectiveness check on the first-year undergraduates of the Department of Chemical Engineering, and the results are as follows: Out of the entire class of forty-six students, no one had difficulty understanding Professor Wang Huanchu's lectures; twenty-six people fully understood, accounting for 56.5%; twenty people could understand but found it somewhat difficult, accounting for 43.5%. Through the exercise sessions, eleven students had no difficulty completing the problem sets independently, while the rest found it difficult but were still able to complete the assignments on time, with only one person unable to complete the assignment. Eighty-seven percent (i.e., forty students) of the students were able to complete the homework within the prescribed self-study time, while six people exceeded the study time, averaging one to two hours per week. More than 75% of all students achieved excellent or good grades last year, and none failed. Due to the improvement of teaching methods and the increase in teaching efficiency, the use of class time last year was reduced by more than one-third compared to the past.
    Professor Wang Huanchu's teaching is conducted in three ways: classroom lectures, exercise sessions, and tutoring, with classroom lectures and exercise sessions as the focus. Each teaching method is permeated with the following basic characteristics:
    First, building a solid teaching foundation based on students' existing knowledge.
    The first-year students at Northwest Institute of Technology come from various middle schools and regions, and some are cadres transferred from work positions, so their levels are very uneven. Some have not studied analytical geometry, solid geometry, or even trigonometry, while others have studied it but have forgotten it. If this "gap" cannot be well filled, it will be difficult to conduct higher mathematics teaching. Professor Wang Huanchu attaches great importance to this point in his teaching. Therefore, at the beginning of each class, he always uses a very short time to let students recall the knowledge they have already learned in the past that is needed for the current lesson and answer questions, and then writes the results of the Q&A on the blackboard. This completely clears the obstacles in the lecture, allowing the lecture to proceed smoothly.
    Second, inspiring students to consciously participate in teaching.
    Advanced Soviet teaching experience tells us that in any teaching method, students must feel that they are participating in teaching, rather than passively accepting knowledge. Professor Wang Huanchu is able to achieve this in his classroom lectures and exercise sessions. When preparing lessons, he focuses on analyzing the teaching materials, finding the connection between the knowledge that students have learned and have not yet learned, as well as the key to the problem, and then considers what conditions should be met in order to solve the key problem, and how to inspire students to achieve the goal of making students understand the new teaching material by themselves. When conducting classroom lectures, Professor Wang Huanchu is very good at concentrating students' attention. When he encounters important points that require students to make their own judgments, he asks questions to make students think and answer.
    The exercise sessions hosted by Professor Wang Huanchu are also organized according to the same spirit. After explaining which category the exercises to be done in this section belong to, and what theories and methods these exercises are based on, he first lets a student work on the blackboard, while the rest of the students work on their own exercise books. When most of the students have finished, he asks the whole class to stop and jointly review the calculation results on the blackboard, first asking the students whether the calculation results are correct, whether the entry method is correct, then criticizing each step of the calculation, and making affirmative and correct conclusions, and finally making comprehensive supplements and explanations. He uses this method to cultivate students' habit of independent thinking and their ability and confidence to solve problems independently.
    Third, explaining new content on the basis of constantly consolidating existing knowledge.
    The entire teaching process is a process of constantly consolidating learned knowledge, adding new knowledge, and gradually improving. Therefore, the responsibility of a teacher is not only to be good at explaining new content, but also to be good at helping students consolidate the theoretical knowledge they have learned. Professor Wang Huanchu is very meticulous in helping students consolidate their existing knowledge. When he explains each definition, theorem, and formula, he not only requires students to be able to understand it, but also to remember it firmly. When necessary, he also tells students the memory method. Later, every time he conducts a lesson and uses these definitions, theorems, and formulas, he leads the students to review them once. For example, when explaining the derivative of the tangent function, first review the derivative of the sine function, the derivative of the cosine function, and the derivative of the quotient of functions, and then guide the students to derive the derivative of the tangent function. As a result of such repeated review and application, students can master it very skillfully.
    In order to enable students to understand and consolidate the new knowledge taught in a timely manner, Professor Wang Huanchu makes a very brief summary after each class, and leaves three to five minutes for students to deeply think about the content taught in this class based on the summary and the important steps of the calculation written on the blackboard, so as to consolidate it in their memory.
    Whenever Professor Wang Huanchu explains a new concept or definition, he always analyzes it into several new combinations of existing knowledge, finds the connection between them, and then deduces it step by step, so that students can accept it more easily.
    Fourth, explaining theories from concrete problems, and then organizing students to apply theories to solve practical problems.
    Lenin once pointed out: "When lecturing, the basic concepts of the course must be clearly defined." Therefore, in classroom lectures, it is very important to explain its physical concepts from reality. When Professor Wang Huanchu talks about the definition of derivative, he starts from the concept of velocity and rate of change. He derives differential equations based on physical phenomena such as the movement of a simple pendulum and atmospheric pressure. He derives the concepts of sequences and series from a sentence in Zhuangzi's book: "A foot-long stick, take half of it every day, will never be exhausted for ten thousand generations." This vivid teaching method will give students a deep impression and will not make them feel that this is just a boring mathematical formula.
    In exercise sessions and homework, Professor Wang Huanchu pays great attention to cultivating students' ability to apply theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems.
    Professor Wang Huanchu's achievements in teaching are closely related to his ability to handle teaching materials well. His handling of teaching materials also reflects the characteristics of his teaching methods.
    Professor Wang Huanchu only talks about theory in the classroom, not examples. Therefore, in the teaching materials, he writes the examples in great detail. Not only does he include all the theories and calculation methods of this section, but he also pays attention to the review of students' existing knowledge (the review covers a wide range, and has key points and systems). In terms of the operation of examples, he strives for detailed steps. When applying the theorems or formulas taught in this course, he notes the chapters, so that students can read and understand it by themselves without any difficulty. In this way, the classroom lectures only focus on the main and systematic theories, as well as the calculation methods and formulas derived from the theories, and use examples only where it is necessary to use examples to explain the theories. As for general examples and relatively trivial problems, they are all left for students to read in self-study time, thus improving the efficiency of classroom lectures and also cultivating students' habit of independent thinking and independent research.
    The fact that Professor Wang Huanchu has achieved certain results in improving teaching methods and improving teaching effectiveness is not accidental. This is not only due to his many years of teaching experience and high professional level, but more importantly, due to his serious and responsible teaching attitude, and his unremitting efforts to study and learn from advanced Soviet experiences.
    Professor Wang Huanchu has always been serious and conscientious in his teaching work. He was originally a supporter of so-called genius education in the old society. After the ideological remolding and learning movement, due to the improvement of political consciousness and the call of the great achievements of the motherland's construction, he changed his old teaching views, thereby improving his enthusiasm and sense of responsibility in teaching work. He often said: "We cannot let a student with unqualified grades go to society and cause losses to the country's economic construction." In the past year, he has made great efforts in lecturing, understanding students' learning situations, and handling teaching materials, often staying up late at night. He can go deep into the students to understand the level of each student and the problems existing in their studies, and take measures such as pre-class review to help students make up for the shortcomings of the past in the connection of mathematical knowledge, so as to eliminate the difficulties for students in listening to lectures in the classroom, and appropriately organize students' mutual assistance in self-study to help students with poor grades, etc. These are of great help to improving the quality of teaching. Although he has been teaching higher mathematics for a long time and has certain teaching experience, he is not complacent because of this; on the contrary, he can humbly learn from advanced Soviet teaching experience. Moreover, in the process of learning, he never forgets our current specific situation and existing problems, and actively and proactively thinks of solutions. He is familiar with the important principles and methods of Kairov's "Pedagogy" and always pays attention to applying these theories to teaching practice. Due to this persistent effort, Professor Wang Huanchu finally achieved his expected teaching goals.

    努力改进教学方法的王焕初教授
    西北工学院教务处
    西北工学院数学教研室主任王焕初教授，在学习苏联先进经验改进教学方法方面，收到了良好的效果。学生对于他的教学普遍地感到满意。我们曾在化工系本科一年级进行了一次教学效果的检查，结果如下：全班四十六个同学，对于王焕初教授的课堂讲授，没有一个人听不懂，其中完全能懂的二十六人，占百分之五十六点五；能听懂，但感到有些困难的二十人，占百分之四十三点五。通过习题课，有十一人自己作题完全没有困难，其余的感到困难，但仍能按时完成作业，只一人不能完成作业。百分之八十七（即四十人）的同学能在规定的自学时间内完成作业，有六人超过学时，平均每周超过一至两小时。全体同学去年全年成绩达到优、良的在百分之七十五以上，没有一个不及格。由于改进教学方法，提高了教学效率，去年一年的学时使用，较以前缩短了三分之一强。
    王焕初教授的教学，是按照课堂讲授、习题课和辅导三种方式进行的，而以课堂讲授和习题课为重点。每一种方式的教学方法，都贯串着以下几个基本特点。
    第一，根据学生已有的知识，建立稳固的教学基础。
    西北工学院一年级的学生，是从各地各中学来的，有一部分是从工作岗位上调来的干部，程度很不整齐。有的没有学过解析几何、立体几何，甚至没有学过三角，有的学过又忘了。如果不能很好地把这一“漏洞”弥补起来，进行高等数学的教学是很困难的。王焕初教授在教学中十分重视这一点，因此每堂课开始，他总是先用极短的时间，把本节课所需要的、过去学生已经学过的知识，让学生回忆一下，并作回答，然后把问答结果写在黑板上。这样就完全扫清了讲课中的障碍；使得讲授能够顺利地进行下去。
    第二，启发学生自觉地参加教学。
    苏联先进教学经验告诉我们，在任何教学方式中，必须让学生感到自己是在参加教学，而不是被动地在接受知识。王焕初教授在他的课堂讲授以及习题课的进行中，都能做到这一点。在备课时，他着重于教材的分析，找出学生已学和未学知识之间的联系，以及问题的关键所在，进而考虑为了解决关键性的问题，应具备那些条件，以及如何启发学生，以达到使学生自行理解这一新教材的目的。在进行课堂讲述时，王焕初教授很能集中学生的注意力。遇到需要学生自己判断的重要地方，就提出问题，使学生思考、回答。
    王焕初教授主持的习题课，也是根据同样的精神组织的。在说明本节所要作的习题是属于那一类的，这类习题所依据的理论和方法是什么之后，就先让一个学生在黑板上作，其余学生在自己的习题本上作。等到大部分学生作完时，就令全班停止下来共同审查黑板上的演算结果，先问学生这演算结果对不对，入手方法对不对，再批判演算的每一步骤，并作出肯定的正确的结论，最后作全面的补充和解释。他用这样的方法来培养学生独立思考的习惯和独立解决问题的能力和信心。
    第三，在不断地巩固已有知识的基础上，讲解新的内容。
    整个教学过程，是不断巩固已学知识，增加新的知识，逐步提高的过程。因此一位教师的职责，不仅要善于讲解新的内容，而且要善于帮助学生巩固已学到的理论知识。王焕初教授在帮助学生巩固已有知识方面，做得是十分细致的。他讲解每一定义、定理和公式，不但要求学生能够理解它，并且能够很牢固地记住它。必要时还告诉学生以记忆方法。以后在每进行一节课，用到这些定义、定理和公式的时候，都要领导学生温习一次。例如：在讲正切函数之导数时，先温习一下正弦函数之导数，余弦函数之导数，和函数之商的导数，然后再引导学生推出正切函数之导数。这样反复温习和运用的结果，学生都能很纯熟地来掌握它。
    为了使学生能及时地理解和巩固所讲的新知识，王焕初教授在每一节课后都要作出极简要的总结，并留出三五分钟让学生针对总结和黑板上所写着的演算的重要步骤，将本节课所讲的内容作深刻的思考，以巩固地留在记忆中。
    王焕初教授每当讲解一个新的概念或定义时，总要把它分析为几个已有知识的新的组合，找出它们之间的联系，然后把它一步一步地推演出来，这样学生就会更容易接受。
    第四，从具体问题出发阐明理论，再组织学生应用理论解决实际问题。
    列宁曾指出：“讲课时必须明确所讲课程的基本概念。”因此在课堂讲授中，从实际出发阐明其物理概念是十分重要的。王焕初教授在讲导数定义的时候，是从速度和变率的概念开始的。他根据单摆的运动，大气压力等物理现象引导出微分方程。他从庄子书中的一句话“一尺之棰，日取其半，万世不竭”，引导出序列和级数的概念。这种生动的讲授方法会给学生以深刻的印象，不会使他们感到这只是枯燥无味的数学公式。
    在习题课和家庭作业中，王焕初教授很注意培养学生应用理论知识解决实际问题的能力。
    王焕初教授在教学上所获得的成绩，和他善于处理教材有密切关系。他在处理教材方面，也反映了他在教学方法上的特点。
    王焕初教授在课堂上只讲理论，不讲例题，因此，在教材里面，他就把例题写得十分详细。不但将本节的理论和计算方法全部包括进去，同时还注意到学生已有知识的复习（复习面很广，而且有重点，有系统）。在例题的运算方面，并力求步骤详细。在应用本课程内所讲过的定理或公式时，就注明章节，务期学生能毫不困难地自行阅读，而加以理解。这样，课堂讲授的只是主要的系统的理论，以及由理论推出的计算方法和公式，在必须运用例题才能阐明理论的地方，才用例题。至于一般的例题和比较枝节的问题，则都留给学生在自学时间阅读，因而提高了课堂讲授的效率，同时也培养了学生独立思考和独立钻研的习惯。
    王焕初教授在改进教学方法，提高教学效果方面，能收到一定的成绩，并不是偶然的。这不只是由于他具有多年的教学经验和较高的业务水平，更重要的是由于他的认真负责的教学态度，由于他不懈地努力钻研、学习苏联的先进经验。
    王焕初教授在教学工作上一贯是严肃、认真的。他原先也是旧社会所谓天才教育的支持者。在思想改造学习运动以后，由于政治觉悟的提高，和祖国伟大建设成就的感召，他改变了旧的教学观点，从而提高了在教学工作上的积极性和责任心。他常常说：“我们不能让一个成绩不合格的学生走到社会上去，使国家经济建设受到损失。”最近一年来，他在讲课、了解学生学习情况以及教材的处理等方面，曾做了很大的努力，常至深夜不眠。他能深入到学生中间，去了解每一位学生的程度和学习上存在的问题，并采取课前回忆的办法，帮助学生弥补过去在数学知识上不衔接的缺点，以扫除学生在课堂上听课的困难，适当地组织学生在自学上的互助，以帮助成绩较差的学生等等，这些对于提高教学质量是有很大作用的。虽然他讲授高等数学已有很久的历史，具有一定的教学经验，但他并未因此骄傲自满；相反的，他能虚心地学习苏联先进教学经验。而且在学习过程中，一刻也没有忘记我们目前的具体情况和存在的问题，积极地、主动地想出解决办法。他熟知凯洛夫“教育学”的重要原理和方法，并且时刻注意把这些理论运用到教学实践中去。由于这种坚持不懈的努力，王焕初教授终于达到了自己预期的教学目的。
