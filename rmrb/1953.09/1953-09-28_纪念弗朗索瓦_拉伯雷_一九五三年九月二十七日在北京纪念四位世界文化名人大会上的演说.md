François Rabelais was a great French humanist, one of the most outstanding scholars and warriors of the European Renaissance. This year marks the 400th anniversary of his death. His struggles and efforts occupy a glorious page in the history of human cultural development. The Chinese people, responding to the call of the World Peace Council, join progressive people around the world and the French people in solemnly commemorating this great French writer.

Rabelais was born in the town of La Devinière (near the ancient city of Chinon) in France. His father was a lawyer who worked in the Chinon court. His year of birth was previously thought to be 1483, but according to recent research, it was 1494 or 1495. He received his early education in the Seuil monastery. In 1519, he entered the Franciscan monastery in Fontenay-le-Comte, where he enthusiastically studied various languages, ancient philosophy, and literature. Later, he transferred to the Benedictine monastery. In 1530, he entered the medical school of the University of Montpellier. Two years later, he went to Lyon to work as a physician in the municipal hospital. Lyon was then the cultural center and publishing center of France. While practicing medicine, he devoted himself to literary work. In 1532, he began publishing some scientific works. As a result, he enjoyed a great reputation in the medical field. Later, he published "The true chronicles of the Grand Pantagruel, King of the Dipsodes, with his deeds and prowess." This work later became the second part of the famous humanist novel "Gargantua and Pantagruel." This work made him famous, but also aroused the condemnation of the theological faculty of the University of Paris. In 1534, his "The Horrible and Dreadful Life of the Great Gargantua, Father of Pantagruel" was published. This became the first part of "Gargantua and Pantagruel." Due to the profound satire of the old society in these novels and the progressive, anti-ignorance humanist ideas expressed in them, the dark forces persecuted him even more severely, forcing him to flee Lyon. In 1546, he published the third part, "The Heroic Deeds and Sayings of Good Pantagruel," and in 1552, he published the fourth part. As for the fifth and final part, it was not published until 1564, after his death.

He died in 1553. The attacks of the dark forces on this great humanist did not stop until his last breath.

Rabelais was a learned scholar. He was a philosopher, mathematician, physician, jurist, musician, geologist, astronomer, botanist, architectural theorist, as well as an artist and poet. Due to his innate talent and his own efforts, his erudition reached a level that only a few could achieve.

But most importantly, he was a fearless cultural warrior. He endured the hardships of life, resisted the constant persecution and oppression of the dark forces, and unflinchingly and mercilessly exposed and ridiculed this dark age, giving the dark forces a heavy and fatal blow. His combative novel "Gargantua and Pantagruel" is not only an immortal and great literary work, but also one in which he poured all his experiences gained from studying real society, all his hopes, and all his anger.

This great work made the dark forces feel threatened, feel infinite hatred and anger, and always wanted to strangle it. But there is no power in the world that can strangle it. In that dark age, Des Périers was forced to commit suicide, and Dolet was hanged and burned in Paris. It caused many clamors and noises in contemporary times. But in Lyon, it was constantly being reprinted. This proves how much the vast number of readers loved it. Due to denunciation, Rabelais was also in danger of being arrested and imprisoned. He had to flee France as soon as the third volume of "Gargantua and Pantagruel" was published. Rabelais created his great novel in this era when the dark forces were rampant, and the words were full of hatred for the dark forces and tyrannical rule.

This great novel is even more significant because it is permeated with a belief: he is convinced that the people and the cause of justice will surely prevail. This powerful optimism, like the sun shining with intense light, penetrates the thick clouds and covers the world. It is a satirical novel, and also a prophecy. He prophesies the permanent victory of peace.

The scale of this long work is extraordinarily grand, almost an encyclopedia of his time. It expounds the scientific principles and philosophical viewpoints of that era. It is full of far-reaching and profound ideals, which are planning the entire course of human history. With great realistic persuasiveness, it exposes the contradictions of feudal French society. It is rooted in the fertile soil of the people. In this novel, the active characters are giants born from ordinary people. Those great, excellent, and kind people are subjected to the attacks of countless robbers of all kinds. If they want to live, to stand, and to achieve their goals, they must arm themselves and fight to the death with the invaders, and completely eliminate them. It broadly expresses the lower strata of feudal French society and the tragic fate of the oppressed people. That light and hope are pinned on the "Great Utopia," the prosperous and fair country he described, and the two kind giants Gargantua and Pantagruel. The struggle between good and evil, light and darkness, expresses how the people's will and wishes are pinned on the victory of good and light. Pantagruel's first battle against the fierce three hundred giants, and his duel with the giant general Loupgarou, who wielded a mace with thirteen diamond thorns at the end, each diamond as large as the bell of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and an unbreakable magic wand, effortlessly subdued them, because those demons were standing on mud feet and not on the land of the people. Pantagruel goes with full confidence to eradicate those invaders of "Utopia," and will not lay down his arms until he has completely eliminated them.

Pantagruel repelled the crazy invader Picrochole III for the second time. Friar John is his loyal comrade-in-arms. Together with the patriots of "Utopia," the noble warriors, they formed the "good people's" army, overthrowing Picrochole and crushing all his arrogant and despicable plots to dominate the world.

From beginning to end, this novel is full of satire and ridicule of the then-authoritative church figures, monks, and the Pope. It also exposes the scenes of the feudal laws running rampant and the pseudo-science of medieval scholastic philosophy. In short, he denounced with extreme hatred all the corrupt feudal state machinery that aimed to oppress the working people; he exposed irreconcilable social contradictions. His strong satire swept away all darkness and evil. He gave the reactionaries a fatal blow. This is why he was constantly oppressed by the reactionaries, and why his novel still shines brightly today and is loved by us.

Gorky believed that Rabelais belonged to the ranks of great writers, who "are good at and dare to express and expose the dirty, shameless, and ugly way of life based on the vampires and parasites cruelly oppressing the people." He said: Rabelais "irreproachably correctly and seriously condemned the crimes of the ruling class." Rabelais's greatness lies here, the merit of all his creations lies here, and his moving power lies here.

His novel calls on everyone to fight for great purposes; it is permeated with love for humanity and the belief that human power is limitless. He holds a deep belief that "life on earth is for peace, not for war." It is for creation, not for destruction. This is also the common belief held by all progressive people of all times.

Rabelais's era was a great era in human history, an era that produced Shakespeare, Cervantes, Leonardo da Vinci, and Michelangelo, an era that produced giants. Engels said: "It was an unprecedented and greatest progressive revolution, an era that needed and produced giants, an era that needed and produced giants in terms of thinking, passion, character, and versatile erudition." And Rabelais was one of the giants needed and produced by this era.

Rabelais, this giant, like the giants he described in his novel, fought to the end for human progress and for defending the cause of justice.

It is of great significance that we commemorate the 400th anniversary of his death in this era, in an era as great as the Renaissance era and the era that produced Rabelais. In our era, war-mongers are clamoring for war and threatening peace. But the forces of peace, the voices of justice, are growing stronger and louder. If the war-mongers dare to launch aggression, they will surely be completely defeated and eliminated by the armies of the good people, like Picrochole.

"Life on earth is for peace, not for war." In commemorating this great writer Rabelais, we must always remember his famous saying.

Peace will achieve lasting victory.

    纪念弗朗索瓦·拉伯雷
    ——一九五三年九月二十七日在北京纪念四位世界文化名人大会上的演说
    郑振铎
    弗郎索瓦·拉伯雷是法兰西的伟大的人文主义者，是欧洲文艺复兴时代最优秀的学者与战士之一。今年是他逝世四百周年的纪念。在人类文化的发展史上，他的战斗与努力是占有辉煌的篇页的。中国人民响应世界和平理事会的号召，和全世界进步人类一起，和法兰西人民一起，隆重的纪念这位伟大的法兰西作家。
    拉伯雷生于法国拉德维尼尔城（近于古城希农）。他的父亲是一个律师，在希农法院里供职，他的生年，过去都以为是一四八三年，但根据最近的考证，是在一四九四年或一四九五年。他曾在塞伊僧院里受到初步的教育。一五一九年，他进了枫德纳·拉·孔德城的圣芳济会修道院，在那里热心的研究各国语文，古代哲学和文学。后来转到本笃会修道院去。一五三○年，他进了蒙彼利埃大学的医学院求学。过了两年，他到里昂去当市立医院医师。里昂是当时法兰西的文化中心、出版业的中心，他一方面行医，一方面就献身于文学事业。一五三二年，他开始发表一些科学著作。因此他在医学界享有盛名。后来出版了一部“提普索提国王潘塔格吕埃尔真正性格的实录以及他的惊人事迹与武功”。这部作品后来成为那著名的人文主义长篇小说“加冈都亚与潘塔格吕埃尔”（“巨人与巨人之子”）的第二部。这部作品使他扬名于世，但同时也惹起巴黎神学院的斥责。一五三四年，他的“潘塔格吕埃尔的父亲，伟大的加冈都亚的骇人听闻的一生”出版了。这成了“加冈都亚与潘塔格吕埃尔”的第一部。由于这些小说中对旧社会的深刻讽刺和这些小说中所表现的进步的，反愚昧的人文主义思想，黑暗势力对他的迫害更甚了，使他不得不逃出里昂。一五四六年，他出版了第三部“善良的潘塔格吕埃尔的英雄行为和传说”，一五五二年出版了第四部。至于第五部，最后的一部，在一五六四年才出版，已在他逝世之后了。
      他死于一五五三年。黑暗势力对于这位伟大的人文主义者的攻击，一直到他的最后一息，还没有停止。
    拉伯雷是一位渊博的学者，他是哲学家、数学家、医学家、法学家、音乐家、地质学家、天文学家、植物学家、建筑学理论家，同时又是艺术家和诗人。由于天赋的才能和自己的努力，他的博学达到了只有少数人才能达到的程度。
    但最重要的还在于他是一位大无畏的文化战士。他忍受着生活的艰苦，抵抗着黑暗势力的不断的迫害与压迫，毫不屈服的，而且毫不留情的揭发着，嘲笑着这个黑暗时代，而给黑暗势力以沉重的致命打击。他的战斗性的长篇小说“加冈都亚与潘塔格吕埃尔”，不仅是一部不朽的伟大的文学作品，而且是把他自己研究现实社会所得到的一切体验，自己的一切希望和自己的一切愤怒，都灌注在其间了。
    这部伟大的作品使黑暗势力感到威胁，感到无限的恨与怒，老想要扼杀它。但天下没有一种力量是能够扼杀它的。在那个黑暗时代，德培尔埃被迫自杀，多雷在巴黎被绞杀后，尸体再被烧掉。它引起了当代许多叫嚣和吵闹。但在里昂，它却不断地被翻印。这便证明广大的读者是如何喜爱它。由于告密，拉伯雷也有被捕下狱的危险。“加冈都亚与潘塔格吕埃尔”第三部一出版他就不得不逃出法兰西国境。拉伯雷就在这个黑暗势力猖獗异常的时代创作他的伟大的长篇小说，字里行间充满了对黑暗势力和暴虐统治的仇恨。
    这部伟大的小说，更具有特别重大意义，它渗透着一种信念：他确信人民和正义事业必将得到胜利。这样强有力的乐观主义，像强烈的光芒四射的太阳，穿透浓云密雾而遍照人间。它是一部讽刺小说，同时也是一篇预言。他预言着和平的永久胜利。
    这篇长篇作品的规模异常弘伟，简直是他那个时代的一部百科全书。它阐述了那个时代的科学原理和哲学观点。它充满了远大高深的理想，这理想是在规划整个人类历史的发展的进程。它以巨大的现实主义说服力，暴露了封建的法兰西社会的矛盾。它是植根于人民的肥沃的土壤中的。在这部长篇小 说里活动着的是一些从普通老百姓中间产生的巨人。那些伟大的，优秀的，善良的人，受到形形色色的数不清的强盗的侵犯。他们要活下去，要站得住，要达到自己的目的，就必须自己武装起来，和侵略者作决死的斗争，而把他们彻底的消灭掉。它广泛的表现了封建法兰西的下层社会，被压迫的人民的悲惨命运。那光明和希望是寄托在“伟大的乌托邦”，那个他所描写的繁荣和公道的国家，和那两个善良的巨人加冈都亚、潘塔格吕埃尔身上。善与恶，光明与黑暗的斗争，正表达出了人民的意志和愿望，是如何的寄托在善与光明的胜利上。潘塔格吕埃尔第一次跟凶恶的三百巨人的斗争，跟那个手使一根狼牙棒，棒端有十三颗金刚钻刺、每一颗金刚钻至少有巴黎圣母院的大钟那样大，且是永远不会折断的魔棒的巨人将军卢勃加鲁的决斗，毫不费力的制服了他们，就因为那些妖魔是泥脚的，不是站在人民的土地上的。潘塔格吕埃尔满怀信心的去铲除那些对“乌托邦”的侵略者，在没有把他们彻
  底消灭之前，他决不放下武器。
    潘塔格吕埃尔第二次又打退了疯狂的侵略者毕可肖三世。约翰修士是他的忠实战友。他们和“乌托邦”的爱国者们，崇高的战士们，组成了“善良的人民”军队，打倒毕可肖，粉碎他那独霸世界的一切狂妄卑劣的阴谋。
    这部长篇小说，从头到尾，充满了对于当时大有权威的教会人士、僧侣和教皇的讽刺、嘲笑。他也暴露了封建法律的逞凶肆虐的画面，暴露了中世纪烦琐哲学的伪科学。总之，他在那里以异常憎恨的心情，痛斥了一切以压迫劳动人民为目的的腐朽了的封建国家机器；他揭发了不可调和的社会矛盾。他的强烈的讽刺，扫荡着一切的黑暗和罪恶。他给反动派以致命的打击。这就是他为何要受到反动派不断压迫的原因，也就是他的这部长篇小说到今天还光芒四射、为我们所爱读的原因。
    高尔基认为拉伯雷是属于那样的伟大作家之一，那就是“善于而且敢于表现、暴露那种以吸血鬼和寄生虫残酷地压迫人民为基础的肮脏的、无耻的、丑恶的生活方式”。他说：拉伯雷“无可非难地正确地而且严肃地指责了统治阶级的罪恶”。拉伯雷的伟大就在这里，他的全部创作的功绩就在这里，他的感人的力量就在这里。
    他的这部长篇小说号召大家为了伟大的目的而斗争；它渗透着对于人类的热爱，渗透着人的力量是不可限量的信念。他抱着一种深刻的信念。“人生在世是为了和平，而不是为了战争”。是为了创造，而不是为了破坏。这也就是一切时代的一切进步人类所抱着的共同的信念。
    拉伯雷的时代是人类历史上的一个伟大时代，是产生莎士比亚、塞凡提司、莱昂纳多·达·芬奇、米凯兰杰罗的时代，是一个产生巨人的时代。恩格斯说道：“是一个前所未有的最伟大的进步的革命，是一个需要和产生巨人的时代，需要和产生在思考力，热情和性格方面，在多才多艺的学识渊博方面的巨人的时代”。而拉伯雷就是这个时代所需要、所产生的巨人之一。
    拉伯雷这个巨人，正像他在那部长篇小说里所描写的巨人般地，为了人类的进步，为了保卫正义的事业而斗争到底。
    我们在这个时代，在一个和文艺复兴时代，和产生拉伯雷的时代同样伟大的时代，纪念他的逝世四百周年是有其重大意义的。在我们这个时代，战争贩子们正在叫嚣着战争，威胁着和平。但和平的力量，正义的呼声，正在日益壮大，日益响亮。战争贩子们如敢于发动侵略，那必定会像毕可肖似的被善良的人民的军队彻底的打垮而被消灭的。
     “人生在世是为了和平，而不是为了战争”我们纪念这位伟大的作家拉伯雷，就要永远记着他的这句名言。
    和平是会得到永久的胜利的。（附图片）
