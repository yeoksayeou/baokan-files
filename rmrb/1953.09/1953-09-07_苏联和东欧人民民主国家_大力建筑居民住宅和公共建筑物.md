Xinhua News Agency, September 6th dispatch from Moscow: Soviet cities continue to vigorously construct residential houses and various public buildings. In Magnitogorsk in the Urals, residential buildings with a total area of more than 33,000 square meters have been built in the first half of this year. By the third quarter of this year, at least 24,000 square meters of residential buildings, a joint clinic, three schools, and several children's welfare institutions will be completed there. In Rostov, an apartment building or office building is completed every two or three days. There are currently 200 construction sites in the city. In Petrozavodsk, the capital of the Karelo-Finnish Republic, a beautiful building has been built for the Karelo-Finnish branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. A new theater is being built opposite it, and the construction of new apartment buildings on Kirov Square is still in full swing. In Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Republic, construction frames stand everywhere on the main thoroughfares and in the suburbs. Construction workers are building many apartment buildings, universities, middle schools, hospitals, cinemas, and office buildings. The residential area of ​​newly built houses in the city this year will increase to two and a half times that of last year. Baku, the capital of the Azerbaijan Republic, is also becoming more and more beautiful. A monumental government building has recently been completed in the center of the city's Stalin Square. This building overlooks the Caspian Sea and is surrounded by lush trees. Baku is now also building a new building for the city's Stalin Museum.

　　Simultaneous with state construction of buildings, the Soviet government also actively helps the working people to build private houses. Anyone who wants to build a private house can receive land from the government and a long-term loan of 10,000 rubles for a period of seven to ten years. In the first two years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), the Soviet working people, with the help of the government, built a total of more than 7 million square meters of private houses. The residential area of private houses built this year will reach more than 3.5 million square meters. By the end of this year, the working people of various cities in the Uzbek Republic will have completed more than 3,000 private houses. Since the beginning of this year, the Republic's public utilities banks have lent workers and staff 15 million rubles in long-term loans, an increase of 12 percent over the entire year last year. In Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Republic, 4,800 private houses are currently under construction. In Frunze, the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2,000 citizens are building their own houses. Several well-equipped private residential areas have appeared near Leningrad. These residential areas are equipped with clubs, pharmacies, kindergartens, and other cultural and welfare institutions.

　　Xinhua News Agency, September 6th dispatch: Eastern European People's Democratic countries are building residential and public buildings.

　　Major industrial cities in Czechoslovakia, such as Ostrava, Kladno, and Most in Slovakia, are undergoing residential construction. Ostrava alone will have 8,000 new houses completed this year for metallurgical workers and miners. Since the establishment of the people's regime, 25,000 well-equipped houses have been built in this city. In Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, construction workers are building new houses and renovating old buildings to make Prague more beautiful. By the end of this year, it is expected that more than 1,100 new houses will be completed.

　　In Warsaw, the capital of Poland, 5,785 new houses, 76 commercial buildings, two kindergartens, four nurseries, a cultural palace, a clinic, and two pharmacies have been completed in the first half of this year. Currently, there are more than 20 residential construction sites in Warsaw.

　　The total residential area of ​​houses built in Romania this year will be twice that of last year. Miners and construction workers alone will receive more than 5,000 houses this year. In Bucharest, the capital, new residences, parks, theaters, and underground tramways are under construction. Hunedoara, a metallurgical worker city, is building new workers' residential areas and cultural palaces. Iasi, an ancient city in Romania, has now become a huge economic and cultural center. In addition to the many new factories that have been built, it also has 88 primary and secondary schools, 42 secondary technical schools, and a higher education institution including 32 departments.

　　Hungary is building 23,000 houses this year, and a large amount of funds has been allocated for the construction of working people's apartment buildings. By the end of this year, Budapest will have 1,000 new houses and many new kindergartens, schools, and shops. Stalin City will have 1,029 new houses completed, Komló will have 500 new houses completed, and Gyöngyös will have 400 new houses completed.

　　The Albanian government also pays attention to improving the living conditions of the working people. During the Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), the average annual housing construction cost was approximately twelve times that of the pre-war year of 1938. In the first two years of the Five-Year Plan, houses with a residential area of ​​more than 100,000 square meters have been built nationwide, and 600 apartment buildings have been built in Tirana, the capital city alone. Currently, housing construction is accelerating throughout the country. During the entire Five-Year Plan period, new houses with a residential area of ​​186,000 square meters will be built nationwide.
