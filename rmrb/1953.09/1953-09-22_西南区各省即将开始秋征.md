Southwest Region Provinces to Begin Autumn Grain Collection Soon

The 1953 agricultural tax autumn collection in the Southwest Region is about to begin. The central government has clearly stipulated that this year's agricultural tax policy is "tax according to the amount of land cultivated, the amount of grain that should be produced, tax rate, and legally prescribed reductions and exemptions, with no tax increase for increased production." In order to correctly implement the guidelines and policies set by the central government and prepare for the autumn collection, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces and Chongqing City have each held agricultural tax work conferences. The meetings first discussed and studied this year's agricultural tax policy, and reviewed the achievements and shortcomings of agricultural tax work in recent years based on this policy. Regarding the agricultural tax work of the past few years, all localities unanimously agreed that great achievements have been made in balancing the national fiscal budget, stabilizing grain prices, ensuring military and civilian food supplies, and supporting the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. However, on the other hand, there are still many shortcomings and errors in the work. The most significant is that there are still abnormally high and abnormally low yields in different regions, which affects the fairness and reasonableness of the burden on farmers; secondly, the implementation of reduction and exemption policies is not sufficient, resulting in two deviations: "reductions and exemptions that should have been granted were not granted" and "reductions and exemptions that should not have been granted were granted"; and in the work of transporting grain into warehouses, serious casualties of people and livestock occurred due to insufficient attention and lax organization. Based on the above situation, all localities have proposed that this year's autumn collection must focus on adjusting yields, legally reducing and exempting taxes, and organizing grain into warehouses, and that the key to doing these tasks well lies in the leadership's attention, earnestly implementing the mass line, and strengthening policy education for cadres. The special districts and counties of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces are now preparing to convey and deploy downwards level by level in accordance with the spirit of the above-mentioned meetings. Yunnan Province is also preparing to conduct a typical experiment on adjusting yields in Kunming to gain experience and guide the adjustment of yields in other parts of the province. After the adjustment, the yields will be fixed to stabilize and improve the farmers' production enthusiasm.

Guizhou and Xikang provinces, because the autumn harvest season is later and the autumn collection starts later, have not yet held meetings, but have also carried out preparatory work. The Finance Department of Guizhou Province has also organized forces to conduct in-depth investigations in typical areas to grasp the materials so that they can be well-informed when holding meetings.

In order to guide and assist the provinces and cities in effectively implementing the instructions on agricultural tax work in 1953 recently issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government, and to do a good job in this year's autumn collection, the Southwest Finance Administration has organized three working groups, in addition to sending personnel to participate in the agricultural tax work conferences of the provinces, which will go to the provinces and cities to participate in typical experiments, and conduct key inspections after the experiments are completed, so as to guide the smooth progress of the autumn collection work in a timely manner.

### 西南区各省即将开始秋征

    西南区各省即将开始秋征
    西南区一九五三年农业税秋征即将展开。今年的农业税收政策，中央已明确规定为“种多少田地，应产多少粮食，依率计征，依法减免，增产不增税”。为了正确地贯彻中央所定的方针和政策，做好秋征的准备工作，四川、云南两省和重庆市均已分别召开了农业税收工作会议。会议首先对今年的农业税收方针作了讨论与研究，并根据这一方针检查了几年来农业税工作的成绩与缺点。对于过去几年的农业税收工作，各地一致认为在平衡国家财政预算和稳定粮价、保证军需民食以及支援抗美援朝等方面成绩是很大的。但另一方面在工作中也还存在着不少的缺点和错误。最显著的是地区之间田土产量还存在着畸高畸低现象，影响了农民负担的公平合理；其次是对于减免政策贯彻得不够，产生了“应该减免的没有减免”和“不应减免的也减免了”的两种偏向；在运送入仓工作中由于重视不够，组织不严，因而发生了严重的人畜伤亡事故。根据以上情况，各地提出今年秋征必须做好调整产量、依法减免和组织入仓工作，而做好这些工作的关键又在于领导重视，认真贯彻群众路线和加强干部政策教育。四川、云南两省各专区和县现正准备根据上述会议精神，逐级向下传达布置。云南省并准备在昆明进行调整产量工作的典型试验，以吸取经验，指导全省其他各地的调整产量工作，调整以后，即将产量固定下来，以稳定和提高农民生产情绪。
    贵州、西康两省由于秋收季节较晚，秋征开始较迟，现虽尚未召开会议，但亦进行了准备工作。贵州省财政厅并组织了力量，选择典型地区进行深入调查，掌握材料，以便召开会议时做到心中有数。
    西南财政管理局为了指导并协助各省市切实贯彻最近中央人民政府政务院所发布的关于一九五三年农业税工作的指示，做好今年秋征工作，除分别派员参加各省农业税收工作会议外，特组织了三个工作组，将分赴各省、市参加典型试验，试验完毕即进行重点检查，以便及时指导秋征工作的顺利进行。
