Autumn Harvest on the Banks of the Yili River

In July, while farmers in other parts of the country are busy weeding, the Yili River Valley is awash in gold, and the Uyghur farmers are starting their autumn harvest in earnest.

This is Turpan Weizi, a Uyghur village on the north bank of the Yili River. This year, the village has had a bumper harvest of autumn crops such as wheat, oats, fruits, and watermelons.

In previous years, the autumn harvest here would continue until heavy snowfall. This year is different. To complete the autumn harvest ahead of schedule, the whole village started preparations as early as May and June. Women sat in the shade of trees making straw ropes, men repaired farm tools... In the past, Uyghur women did not work in the fields, but now, under the leadership of the village women's federation, they are all mobilized to participate in the autumn harvest. Like the men, they harvest in the fields during the day and help with threshing at night. (Photo by our reporter Zhu Bo)

The Youth League took the lead in mobilizing the whole village to establish temporary mutual aid groups to better complete the autumn harvest task ahead of schedule. This is a scene of Padi Ji'er, a female Youth League member, helping Musa Li bundle wheat.

In the boundless wheat fields, the Uyghur compatriots are stepping up the wheat harvesting work.

Communist Party members Hami'erding, Amai Ti, Tuohe Ti, and Yaku Bu of Turpan Weizi Village, Yining County, are meeting to study the steps to complete this year's autumn harvest work ahead of schedule.

Tuohe Ti and his wife Er Yi Han sharpened their sickles before the autumn harvest to prepare for the harvest.

In the past, women here did not participate in agricultural production labor, but this year is different. In order to complete the autumn harvest ahead of schedule, the Women's Federation mobilized all the women in the village to actively participate in the autumn harvest movement.

Mahe Mu Ti is a labor model. He and six other Uyghur compatriots voluntarily organized an agricultural production cooperative. This is the chairman of the district farmers' association and Mahe Mu Ti inspecting the results of this year's trial planting of new seeds.

The farmers of Turpan Weizi Village set off in groups to the wheat fields to harvest wheat.

In order to complete the autumn harvest work ahead of schedule, in addition to continuing to harvest wheat, Tu'er Mi's family also left two people at home to thresh the wheat.

This year, Turpan Weizi Village also had a bumper harvest of fruits. Women and children are busy harvesting fruits.

While the farmers are busy with the autumn harvest, they still try to use their spare time to build their new houses. More than 30 households in Turpan Weizi Village have started building new houses this year. This is Ta Yi'er Bai Ke cleaning the newly built house. In a few days, after the new house is dry, he can move in.

Mahe Mu Ti Agricultural Production Cooperative planted 40 mu of watermelons this year, which are big and sweet, and are the best-growing watermelons in the village.

    伊犁河畔的秋收
    七月，全国其它地方农民正在紧张地锄草的时候，在伊犁河谷，却遍地是黄金色，维吾尔族的农民都紧张地开始了秋收。
    这是伊犁河北岸的一个维族村庄——吐鲁番圩孜，今年这个村庄秋季作物：小麦、燕麦、水果和西瓜等都获得丰收。
    往年，这里秋收要继续到下大雪，今年不同了，全村为了提前完成秋收，早在五、六月份就开始了秋收的准备工作，妇女们坐在树荫下打草绳，男人们整修农具……。往年维族妇女不下地，现在在村妇联领导下全部动员起来参加秋收工作。她们和男人一样，白天在地里收割，夜晚还帮助打场。（本报记者朱波摄）
    青年团带头发动全村成立临时互助组，以便更好地来提前完成秋收的任务。这是青年团女团员帕地吉尔帮助木沙里捆麦子的情形。
    在一望无际的麦田里，维族同胞正在加紧小麦的收割工作。
    伊宁县吐鲁番圩孜村的共产党员哈米而丁、阿买提、托合提和亚库布等在开会，研究提前完成今年秋收工作的步骤。
    托合提和他的妻子尔伊汗在秋收前就把镰刀磨得快快的，准备秋收。
    往年，这里的妇女是不参加农业生产劳动的，可是今年不同了，为了提前完成秋收，妇女联合会对全村妇女做了动员工作，要她们也积极参加秋收运动。
    麻合木提是个劳动模范，他和其他六家维族同胞自愿地组织了农业生产合作社。这是区农会主席和麻合木提在一起察看今年试播新种的结果。
    吐鲁番圩孜村的农民们，成群结队地出发到麦地里去收割小麦了。
    为了提前完成秋收工作，吐尔米家除了继续收割麦子以外，还留了两个人在家打麦。
    今年吐鲁番圩孜村的水果也是丰收。妇女和孩子们都在忙着收获水果。
    农民们在紧张的秋收中，仍想法利用空闲时间来修建自己的新房子，吐鲁番圩孜村今年已动工修建新房子的有三十多户人家。这是塔伊尔拜克在打扫刚修好的房子，再过几天，新房子干燥后就可以搬过去了。
    麻合木提农业生产合作社今年种了四十亩西瓜，又大又甜，是全村长得最好的西瓜。
