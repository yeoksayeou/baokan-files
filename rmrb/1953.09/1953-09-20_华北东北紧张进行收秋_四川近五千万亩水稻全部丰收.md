Xinhua News Agency reports: Farmers in North and Northeast China are tensely carrying out the autumn harvest.

In the North China region, the major autumn crops have ripened successively. In Yuncheng, Linfen, Changzhi, and other special districts of Shanxi Province, the harvesting of corn, millet, and other crops has begun. Jincheng County had already completed the harvesting of more than 450,000 mu of broomcorn millet, mung beans, sorghum, and millet by the end of August. In the earlier harvesting areas of Handan, Shijiazhuang, and other seven special districts of Hebei Province, autumn grains such as sorghum and corn are now on the market. In eastern and western Suiyuan Province, naked oats, buckwheat, and peas have all ripened. Harvesting work has begun in Wudong, Wuchuan, and other places, and the counties behind the Daqing Mountains have finished harvesting wheat and naked oats. The growth of autumn crops in North China this year has generally been good. Except for some areas in the plains that have experienced reduced production due to spring drought and autumn flooding, most areas and mountainous regions are expected to have a bumper harvest. The output of Shanxi Province is expected to exceed last year's output by about 12 percent. Most counties in the mountainous areas of Hebei Province have a 70 percent harvest this year, and individual counties in the plains can reach a 100 percent harvest. Farmers in waterlogged areas are draining water and recovering land. Most of the early autumn crops can generally be harvested. Although the area of late autumn crops is small, and there has been some reduction in production, the impact is not significant. In Suiyuan Province, except for some areas where production has been reduced due to drought, Guyang and other counties have an average harvest of about 70 percent. Although there has been more rain in the suburbs of Beijing this autumn, the impact has been small, and the autumn seedlings are growing well. Most areas are expected to have a bumper harvest.

The vast areas of Northeast China are beginning the autumn harvest under the slogan "reap as it ripens" and "prevent frost and protect the autumn, return every grain home." Areas such as western Liaoning, Rehe, and Lushun, where the season is earlier, have already started harvesting. Areas such as Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Jilin, where the season is later, are preventing frost and protecting the autumn, actively promoting the early ripening of crops, and have begun harvesting early-maturing crops such as broomcorn millet. Judging from the crop growth in various places, most areas of Northeast China can obtain a better harvest this year, except for some areas along the rivers that have suffered reduced production due to flooding. At present, leading organs in various places have sent cadres to the villages to specifically lead the protection of the autumn harvest. With the help of the government and supply and marketing cooperatives, farmers in various places have prepared various tools for the autumn harvest. Many mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives have formulated autumn harvest action plans, which implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, especially cherishing grain.

[Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 18th dispatch] Nearly 50 million mu of rice in Sichuan Province have all been harvested with a bumper yield and have basically been completely reaped. More than 30 counties along the Yangtze River and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, such as Luxian, Jiangjin, and Neijiang, have generally increased production by about 10 percent. Counties such as Baxian, Qijiang, and Jiangjin, which once suffered from drought, are also estimated to have increased production by more than 5 percent. The rice in more than 30 counties in northern Sichuan has achieved the largest harvest in history. In the western Sichuan Plain, where the season is later, the harvesting of mid-season rice is nearing completion. Cadres and farmers in Zizhong County described the situation of this year's overall bumper harvest as: "In previous years, it was not easy to find high yields, but this year it is not easy to find low yields."

The yields of state-owned farms and mutual aid teams in various places are even higher than those of ordinary farmers. The 674 mu of rice in the state-owned Wanxian Mountain Agricultural Experiment Station produced an average of more than 580 jin of rice per mu, an increase of 20 percent compared to last year, and 30 percent higher than the yield of local farmers. The more than 79,000 mutual aid teams in Jiangjin Special District generally harvested more grain than individual farmers. It is estimated that the yield of perennial mutual aid teams is about 5 percent higher than that of individual farmers.

    华北东北紧张进行收秋
    四川近五千万亩水稻全部丰收
    据新华社讯：华北、东北两区农民正在紧张地进行收秋。
    华北区大秋作物先后成熟，山西省运城、临汾、长治等专区已开始收割玉米、谷子等作物，晋城县八月底就将四十五万多亩黍子、绿豆、高粱、谷子收割完毕。河北省邯郸、石家庄等七个专区收割较早的地区，高粱、玉米等秋粮现已上市。绥远省绥东绥西的莜麦、荞麦、豌豆都已成熟，武东、武川等地收割工作已开始，大青山后各县已把小麦、莜麦收完。华北区今秋作物生长情况一般良好，除平原部分地区因春旱和秋涝减产外，一般地区和山区都可望丰收。山西省产量约可超过去年产量百分之十二。河北省山区多数县份今年都有七成收成，平原地区个别县可达十成年景。水涝地区农民正在排水脱地，早秋作物一般可收获大部，晚秋作物面积较少，虽有些减产，但影响不大。绥远省除部分地区因旱减产外，固阳等县平均约有七成年景。北京市郊区虽秋季多雨，但影响不大，秋苗生长得很好，大部地区可望丰收。
    东北广大地区正在“熟一片、割一片”“防霜护秋、颗粒还家”的口号下开始秋收。季节较早的辽西、热河和旅大等地区已动镰收割。季节较晚的黑龙江、松江、吉林等地区正在防霜护秋，积极促成庄稼早熟，并开始收割糜子等早熟作物。从各地作物生长情形看，今年东北除部分沿江河地区受涝减产外，大部地区可获得较好收成。目前，各地领导机关都派干部深入到村屯，具体领导护秋收割。各地农民在政府、供销合作社的帮助下，已准备了秋收用的各种工具。许多互助组和农业生产合作社都已订好秋收行动计划，在计划中贯彻了增产节约，特别是爱护粮食的精神。
    【新华社成都十八日电】四川省近五千万亩水稻全部丰收，并已基本收割完毕。长江两岸和成渝铁路沿线的泸县、江津、内江等三十多个县，大部地区都增产一成左右。曾一度遭受干旱的巴县、綦江、江津等县，估计也增产半成以上。四川北部三十几个县的水稻获得历年最大的丰收。节令较迟的川西平原，中稻收割已接近完毕。资中县干部和农民形容今年全面丰收的情形说：“往年不容易找到高额产量，今年不容易找到低额产量。”
    各地国营农场和互助组的产量更高过一般农民。国营万县山区农事试验场六百七十四亩水稻，平均每亩产五百八十多斤稻谷，比去年增产百分之二十，比当地农民产量高出百分之三十。江津专区七万九千多个互助组，一般都比个体农民多收了粮食。估计其中常年性互助组的产量高出个体农民百分之五左右。
