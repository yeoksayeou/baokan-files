    The Ministry of Railways prepares to launch a patriotic labor competition
    This year, it will increase production and economize 4.1 trillion yuan
    [Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways, and the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union of China jointly convened a national conference of senior cadres of the railway system in early September to discuss increasing production, increasing revenue, practicing strict economy, and tightening expenditures in order to overfulfill the national plan. Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, made a mobilization report at the meeting, calling on all railway workers to increase production and save 4.1 trillion yuan this year. At the meeting, each Railway Administration and Engineering Bureau put forward their respective goals.
    After analyzing the completion of the main indicators in the first half of the year, the meeting made estimates for the work in the second half of the year. According to the materials already available, it is estimated that in the second half of the year, with the exception of mineral construction materials transport, which may decrease slightly due to the nearing completion of projects, the transport of other materials such as coal, timber, and cotton will increase. This is a condition for completing the national transportation plan in the second half of the year. However, there are only three months left from now until the end of the year, and the construction time for some engineering departments is only one to two months, which is very short. In the past six months, the quality of railway work has been very low, and there have been many accidents. Although the lines affected by floods have been reopened to traffic, the roadbeds still need to be reinforced. In addition, some places have more rain this year, and the winter climate may be very cold, which will cause some difficulties in transportation. If these potentially difficult factors cannot be adequately estimated in advance and necessary measures are taken, it will not be possible to smoothly complete the production increase and savings plan.
    The meeting emphasized that while actively implementing the production increase and savings plan, it is necessary to grasp the policies. Striving to load more wagons and complete more converted ton-kilometers is the main content of increasing production and increasing revenue in the railway system. Railway Administrations, Sub-bureaus, sections, and stations must strive for the leadership and specific assistance of local Party committees and governments, closely liaise with cargo owners, actively organize freight transport, and strengthen planned transport, but prevent repeating the mistake of blindly soliciting cargo sources. The main content of savings in the railway system is to suspend projects that can be postponed or are optional, improve labor organization, reduce unnecessary agency and non-production personnel expenditures, prevent waste, utilize obsolete and waste materials, and continue to carry out the struggle to save fuel. In practicing strict economy and tightening expenditures, expenditures related to transportation equipment, locomotive and vehicle maintenance, and line maintenance and overhaul must not be reduced; welfare expenditures for employees stipulated in collective contracts must not be compressed at will. In practicing strict economy and tightening expenditures, the development of work should be carefully considered to ensure the organic connection between this year's and next year's work. After the launch of the production increase and savings campaign, work should be maintained in a normal order, and the phenomenon of arbitrary overtime work that disregards the health of employees should be prevented.
    In order to smoothly complete the production increase and savings plan, the meeting believes that: First, ideological leadership should be strengthened to make the broad masses of railway employees realize the great political and economic significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and realize the favorable conditions and arduousness in completing the plan. Therefore, it is necessary to oppose both the blindly optimistic and relaxed mood, and to oppose the thinking that emphasizes objective difficulties. Second, mobilize and organize all railway employees to launch a patriotic labor competition, tap potential, find shortcuts, and promote the advanced experience of the former Changchun Railway of China to ensure the completion of the production increase and savings plan. Third, each bureau should analyze the completion of the production and financial plans in the past eight months, formulate effective measures to ensure the realization of the production increase and savings plan, and revise technical organizational measures; strengthen specific leadership, and overcome bureaucratic work styles and generalized leadership methods. In addition, inspection work should also be strengthened, commendations and criticisms should be made in a timely manner, and the progress of the work should be reported to the Ministry of Railways every ten days. The meeting finally pointed out that while seizing the time to complete this year's annual transportation plan and basic construction plan, it is also necessary to grasp the policy of increasing production, practicing strict economy, focusing on key construction, and advancing steadily, learn from the experience and lessons of this year's work, and realistically and actively prepare and compile the plans for 1954.
    Finally, Minister Teng Daiyuan made a summary. The Political Department of the Ministry of Railways and the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union of China separately convened meetings of political work cadres and trade union cadres to further discuss methods to ensure the completion of the production increase and savings plan.

    铁路系统准备开展爱国劳动竞赛
    今年将增产节约四万一千亿元
    【本报讯】中央人民政府铁道部、铁道部政治部和中国铁路工会全国委员会在九月初联合召开了全国铁路系统高级干部会议，讨论增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支，以超额完成国家计划的问题。中央人民政府铁道部部长滕代远在会上作了动员报告，号召全路职工今年度增产节约四万一千亿元。会上，各铁路管理局、工程局分别提出了奋斗目标。
    会议在分析了上半年主要指标的完成情况后，对下半年工作做了估计。根据已经掌握的材料估计，下半年除矿物性建设材料的运输，由于工程接近完工阶段，可能稍有减少外，其他如煤、木材、棉花等物资的运输都将增加。这是下半年可以完成国家运输计划的条件。但是，从现在到年底只剩了三个多月，有些工程部门的施工时间只剩了一个月到两个月，时间很短促了。半年来，铁路工作质量很低，事故也很多；遭受水害的线路虽已通车，路基还须加固。加以某些地方今年雨水较多，冬季气候可能十分寒冷，将造成运输方面的一些困难。如果事先不能适当地估计到这些可能造成困难的因素，并采取必要措施，就不可能顺利地完成增产节约计划。
    会议着重指出：在积极执行增产节约计划的同时，必须掌握政策。争取多装车和完成更多的换算吨公里，是铁路系统增加生产、增加收入的主要内容。铁路各管理局、分局、段站必须争取地方党和政府的领导及具体帮助，密切与货主联系，积极组织货运，加强计划运输，但要防止重犯盲目招揽货源的错误。铁路系统节约的主要内容，是停办可以推迟或可做可不做的工程，改善劳动组织，缩减不必要的机构和非生产人员的开支，防止浪费，利用呆旧废料，并继续开展节约燃料的斗争。在厉行节约、紧缩开支中，对于运输有关设备、机车车辆检修以及线路维修大修等开支不得削减；对于集体合同中规定的职工福利开支，不得随意压缩。在厉行节约、紧缩开支中，应周密考虑工作的发展，确保今年和明年工作的有机衔接。增产节约运动开展起来以后，应保持工作按照正常秩序进行，防止不顾职工健康任意加班加点的现象。
    为了顺利完成增产节约计划，会议认为：首先应加强思想领导，使广大铁路员工认识到增产节约的重大政治意义和经济意义，认识到完成计划中间的有利条件和艰巨性，因此，既须反对盲目乐观、轻松愉快的情绪，也要反对强调客观困难的思想。其次，动员组织全路职工开展爱国劳动竞赛，挖掘潜力，寻找窍门，推广前中国长春铁路的先进经验，保证完成增产节约计划。第三、各局应分析八个月来生产财务计划完成的情况，订出保证实现增产节约计划的有效措施，并修订技术组织措施；加强具体领导，克服官僚主义作风和一般化的领导方法。此外，还应加强检查工作，及时表扬批评，并在每十天将工作进行情况向铁道部汇报。会议最后指出：在抓紧时间完成今年年度的运输计划和基本建设计划的同时，还应掌握增加生产、厉行节约、重点建设、稳步前进的方针，吸取今年工作当中的经验教训，实事求是地、积极着手准备和编制一九五四年各项计划。
    最后，滕代远部长作了总结。铁道部政治部和中国铁路工会全国委员会分别召集政治工作干部、工会干部开会，进一步讨论了怎样保证完成增产节约计划的方法。（据人民铁道报消息）
