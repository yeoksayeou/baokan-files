    Struggling to Increase Grain Harvests
    Small Interests Subordinate to Larger Interests, Waterlogging Finds an Outlet
    In many areas of the Tianjin Special District in Hebei Province, waterlogging has caused disasters, inundating autumn crops and hindering autumn plowing and planting. Many cadres in the Tianjin Special District have gone deep into the disaster areas, mobilizing the masses to find ways to drain the water from various aspects. In Wen'an County, the crops east of Shigezhuang to Zuogezhuang were flooded, and the autumn harvest seemed hopeless. Later, after county and district cadres and technicians conducted in-depth surveys of the waterlogged areas, they found a way to discharge water to the low-lying areas of Wen'an. However, to use this method of drainage, the consent of the masses in the Ma Wuying Township, located in the low-lying area, was needed. Therefore, the county first drew a waterlogging map and then convened a meeting of the CCP District Committee secretaries and township cadres, using the waterlogging map to explain the principle of small interests being subordinate to larger interests to the district and township cadres. After discussion, everyone agreed to this drainage method, and the water is now being drained. At the border between Ba County and Shengfang Town, there is also a large area of ​​flooded fields, and the water needs to pass through the land in Shengfang to be introduced into the reed ponds and wastelands, which would cause some crop losses. After discussions between the masses on both sides, the masses who benefited reasonably compensated the masses whose crops were damaged by drainage, and an agreement was reached, saving the crops in this area. Wuqing County and the suburban areas of Tianjin City also adopted an agreement method to find four drainage outlets, which can drain water from large areas of land and has now started draining. In Yangliuqing Town, some crops have been saved due to leading cadres conducting in-depth field investigations and fully mobilizing the masses to find drainage outlets. The town has made use of all possible drainage conditions. Because all counties can grasp the principles of drainage, mobilize the masses, and rely on the masses to find solutions, according to incomplete statistics for the entire region, there are currently twenty-three places where flooding can be opened, and five culverts and canals can be used for drainage. Many autumn crops have been saved.

    Rushing to Repair Embankments, Turning Danger into Safety
    The Party committees and governments at all levels in the Jiaozhou area of ​​Shandong led the broad masses to quickly overcome the floods and protect the autumn crops. In August, due to heavy rain and rising rivers, some counties in the Jiaozhou area suffered from floods. Responsible comrades from the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office immediately led a large number of cadres deep into the riverside areas to lead the masses in flood control and drainage work. The flood of the Dagu River exceeded the safe water level twice, and there were several places where the embankment body leaked water and dozens of dangerous spots overflowed, the situation was very critical. Many responsible cadres and the broad masses worked day and night on the embankment, rushing to repair and block the breaches in time, finally repairing the river embankments that had been in danger or were about to be in danger, eliminating the threat of flooding. In some areas, many autumn crops were flooded due to overflowing river water. After draining the water, most of the autumn crops have been saved. Now, farmers in various places are carrying out vegetable planting, seedling support, and preparations for the autumn harvest.
    Unified Dispatch of Waterwheels for Drought Resistance
    Some areas in Shaanxi are currently experiencing drought, and farmers urgently need waterwheels to irrigate their land. The Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Cooperatives, the Water Conservancy Bureau, and other departments have taken emergency measures, dispatching special personnel to the countryside to dispatch waterwheels to support farmers in their drought resistance work. This year, the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Cooperatives supplied farmers with 10,000 waterwheels, most of which have played their due role in production. However, due to the lack of a thorough supply plan, some areas have a surplus of waterwheels, while others still need a large number of waterwheels. In order to enable all waterwheels to play the greatest role in drought resistance, comrades engaged in dispatch work went deep into various places to understand the specific situation and conducted on-site dispatch according to the distance of the area. Now, in addition to调回来returning more than 200 waterwheels from Zhouzhi County and allocating them to areas in Chang'an County and other places that urgently need waterwheels, dispatching is still continuing.
    Watering Acre by Acre, Rice with Scorched Leaves Turns Green Again
    In the Yao Erbao mutual aid team of the Puhui Township, Xiagang District, Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, several rice paddies with rice already in the milky stage were lacking irrigation water, the rice leaves turned yellow and began to wither.
    One night, the team members gathered on the threshing floor to read the newspaper. After reading the "Emergency Circular on the Drought Situation in the South and Opinions on Drought Prevention and Resistance" from the Central Production Drought Prevention Office, team leader Yao Erbao said: "We can't delay any longer, let's all start tomorrow!" That night, they discussed methods such as watering high fields first, watering low fields later, and irrigating dry fields frequently. Every day, Zhu Changbao was responsible for checking the rice fields and discussing which fields to water the next day, allocating labor, and consulting with individual households whose fields were connected to cooperate in watering for drought resistance.
    In less than three days, the team's fields were watered in order, acre by acre. The rice that had already "scorched" is now turning green and growing again, and the rice grains are also like rat's eyes, plump and full. Now, the team members are preparing for the autumn harvest with joy.
    Experiencing the Benefits of Organization in Drought Resistance
    In the drought resistance and autumn protection work in the Jinjiang Special District of Fujian Province, the leadership, according to the specific situation of each period, put forward timely requirements, gave play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and the masses, and greatly reduced the affected area. At the beginning of drought resistance, they proposed methods of rationally managing and fully utilizing existing water sources, discovering new water sources, and gradually expanding the irrigated area. However, as the drought expanded and deepened, it was no longer possible to blindly expand the irrigated area, because this would create the danger of trying to protect everything, but ultimately protecting nothing. Therefore, they consulted with the masses to carry out planned seedling protection. Under this general requirement, for white land that had not been transplanted or this year's fields that had already been transplanted but could not be saved, they strived to replant late sweet potatoes or plant other late-maturing crops. In the urgent struggle against drought, the broad masses of farmers urgently demanded mutual assistance and cooperation. The leading cadres at all levels in the Jinjiang Special District adapted to this requirement and provided correct leadership, so that many farmers organized themselves by river, stream, water inlet, and pond to resist drought. When a pond or well was dug deeper and deeper, so deep that waterwheels could not be used and water needed to be lifted with a crane, these mutual aid organizations would then separate to lift water. In the struggle against drought, farmers deeply realized the need for this kind of mutual assistance, so the number of temporary mutual aid groups greatly increased.
    Due to the strengthening of leadership, 90% of the late rice in the Jinjiang Special District has been transplanted during the drought resistance period, and the middle rice and other autumn crops have also reduced the degree of damage. In late August, they seized the opportunity of rain to rush to plant and protect the autumn crops. Now, all kinds of crops in the special district have turned green.
    Election Cadres Assist Farmers in Protecting Autumn Harvest
    The cadres engaged in the general election work in various parts of Jiangsu Province have grasped the principle that the general election must be subordinate to production and have assisted local cadres in leading the masses to devote themselves wholeheartedly to the struggle against drought and to protect the autumn harvest. The cadres in charge of the general election work in Wangxian Township, Jiading County, consulted with village cadres and experienced farmers in various villages, organized 37 water-pushing teams and 6 water-treading teams, and watered more than 500 mu of land in two days, turning withered rice green. After research by the working group and village cadres in Huangtang Township, Danyang County, water conservancy groups were established in each electoral district to lead the masses in drought resistance. The drought situation in Zhubei Township, Yixing County, was serious, and nearly one-fifth of the township's rice fields were damaged by drought. Therefore, the working group took drought resistance and autumn protection as the current central task, mobilized the masses to dig ditches to divert water, and organized the masses to rent water-lifting machines to lift water, rescuing more than 840 mu of rice fields in ten days. The working group in Jiuli Township, Changshu County, cooperated with village cadres in the drought resistance work, mobilized the masses to organize temporary work teams, and appropriately adjusted agricultural tools. Now, most of the fields have been watered, so that the rice will not suffer serious damage due to drought within ten to fifteen days. According to the specific situation in their respective areas, the cadres of the general election working groups mobilized and led the masses to eliminate rice borers, and also achieved great results.

    为增加粮食收获量而斗争
    小利服从大利，积水有了出路
    河北省天津专区许多地方积水成灾，淹了秋庄稼，妨碍了秋耕秋种。天津专区许多干部都深入灾区，发动群众从多方面寻找排泄积水的出路。文安县史各庄以东至左各庄中间的庄稼被积水淹了，眼看秋庄稼收成无望，后来经过县区干部和技术人员深入积水地区勘察，才找出了向文安低洼处泄水的道路。但是用这方法泄水，应当取得位于低洼处的马武营乡群众的同意，于是首先由县里绘制积水图，然后召开中共区委书记及乡干部会议，运用积水图向区乡干部讲解小利服从大利的原则，经过讨论，大家都同意这样排水，现在积水已开始排泄。霸县和胜芳镇交界处也有一大块被淹的田地，积水需要通过胜芳境内的土地，才能引入芦塘荒洼，这样有一部分庄稼就要遭受损失。这种情势经过双方群众讨论，由受益群众合理地补偿因排水受到损失的群众的庄稼，结果达成了协议，使这块土地中的庄稼得到拯救。武清县和天津市郊区采取协议的办法也找到了四处排水出路，能使大块土地内的积水泄出，现在已开始排泄。杨柳青镇被淹的地，由于领导干部深入实地调查，充分发动群众想办法找排水出路，已有一部分庄稼得救。该镇把可能利用的排水条件都已经利用起来。由于各县都能掌握排水原则，发动群众和依靠群众想办法，据全区目前不完全的统计，已有二十三处可以开沽和利用五个涵闸及渠道泄水。许多秋庄稼已经得到拯救。
    （厉树仁、李玉琪、王山）
    抢修堤坝，转危为安
    山东胶州地区各级党委、政府领导广大群众迅速地战胜水灾，保卫了秋禾。八月间，因为雨多河涨，胶州地区有些县份曾遭受水灾。地委、专署负责同志立即带领大批干部深入沿河各地，领导群众进行防洪、排水工作。大沽河的洪水，有两次超过保险水位，曾有数处堤身透水、数十处险工漫溢，情况非常危急。许多负责干部和广大群众昼夜在堤上工作，及时抢修、抢堵，终于修复了已经出险和将要出险的河堤，消除了水灾的威胁。有些地区曾因河水泛滥，不少秋禾被淹。经过排除积水，大部秋禾已被救出。现在，各地农民正进行种菜、扶苗和准备秋收等工作。
    统一调度水车抗旱
    陕西一些地区现正呈现旱象，农民急需水车浇地。陕西省合作联社、水利局等部门采取紧急措施，派遣专人下乡，调度水车，支援农民进行抗旱工作。今年，陕西省合作联社给农民供应了一万部水车，绝大部分都在生产中起了应有的作用，可是，因为供应计划不大周密，有的地区水车过剩，有的地区仍然需要大量水车。为了使全部水车在抗旱工作中发挥最大的作用，进行调度工作的同志深入各地了解具体情况，根据地区远近，就地进行调度。现在除从盩厔调回二百多部水车，拨往长安等县急需水车的地区外，仍在继续调度中。
    挨丘挨亩灌水，卷梢稻子回青
    江苏省江阴县夏港区普惠乡姚二宝互助组有几丘稻田里已经上浆的稻子，缺了养稻水，稻叶发黄，开始枯萎。
    一天夜晚，组员们齐集在打麦场上读报，读了中央生产防旱办公室“关于南方旱情及防旱抗旱意见的紧急通报”后，组长姚二宝就说：“我们也不能再拖啦，明天大家动手吧！”当晚并讨论好高田先车、低田晚灌、干田勤灌等办法，每天由朱长宝负责检查稻田，并讨论好明天车那几丘水，分配好劳动力，会同好合田丘的单干户，去车水抗旱。
    不到三天，全组田亩顺着次序，挨丘挨亩地都灌上了水。已经“卷梢”的稻子，现在又发青生长了，稻粒子也像老鼠眼睛一般，粒粒饱满地上足了浆。现在组员们以满怀喜悦的心情，准备秋收工作了。
    抗旱中体会到组织起来的好处
    福建省晋江专区领导方面在抗旱保秋工作中，根据各个时期的具体情况，提出适合时宜的要求，发挥了广大干部和群众的积极性，使受灾面积大大减少。在开始抗旱时，他们提出合理管理和充分运用现有水源，发现新水源，逐步扩大灌溉面积的办法。但随着旱情的扩大和加深，就不能再继续盲目地扩大灌溉面积，因为这样有造成什么也保，最后什么也保不住的危险，所以就和群众商量，进行有计划的保苗。在这一总的要求下，对没有插秧的白地或虽已插秧但已经无法挽救的本田，就争取改插晚蕃薯或种植其他晚熟作物。在紧急的抗旱斗争中，广大农民迫切要求互助合作。晋江专区各级领导干部适应这一要求加以正确领导，使许多农民都以一道河、一条溪、一个水口、一个池塘为单位组织起来抗旱。当一个池塘、一个水井愈挖愈深，深到不能用水车而需要用吊杆吊水的时候，这些互助组织就又分散开吊水。在抗旱斗争中农民深深体会到这种互助的需要，所以临时互助组大大增加了。
    由于加强了领导，晋江专区连作晚稻百分之九十已在抗旱期间抢插完毕，中稻及其他秋季作物也减轻了受害的程度。八月下旬，又趁雨抢种、保秋，现在该专区的各种作物都已转青了。
    普选干部协助农民保秋
    江苏省各地普选工作干部，掌握了普选必须服从生产的原则，协助当地干部领导群众全力投入抗旱保秋的斗争。嘉定县望仙乡的普选工作干部，到各村和村干部、老农商量，组织了三十七个推水组、六个踏水组，两天浇了五百多亩田的水，使枯稻转青。丹阳县皇塘乡工作组和乡村干部研究后，按各选区成立水利小组领导群众抗旱。宜兴县渚北乡旱情严重，干坏的稻田将近全乡稻田的五分之一，于是工作组把抗旱保秋作为当地当前的中心工作，发动群众挖沟引水，并组织群众租戽水机戽水，前后十天抢救稻田八百四十余亩。常熟县九里乡的工作组在抗旱工作中，配合乡村干部，发动群众组织临时伴工组，适当调剂农具，现在大部分的田都车上了水，使稻谷在十天到半个月内不致因天旱遭受严重影响。各地普选工作组干部根据当地具体情况，又动员和领导群众消灭螟虫，也取得很大成绩。
