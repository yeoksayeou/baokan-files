Strengthening Leadership in Coal Mine Tunneling Work

The object of production in coal mines is the coal seam buried in the geological stratum. To extract this coal, it is first necessary to excavate the working space for coal mining underground, including various roadways and coal mining faces. To ensure smooth production and prevent unexpected accidents, it is essential to complete the above tunneling work before coal mine production begins, ensuring that each mine has stable and continuous production of mining faces and the necessary reserve faces. Only by doing a good job in tunneling can the continuous and balanced production of coal mines be guaranteed; only then can planned management be implemented, labor productivity improved, safety enhanced, and so on.

However, the current situation in coal mines across China is that tunneling work is generally lagging behind the needs of production development, which seriously affects production. One of the important reasons why coal mines did not fulfill the state plan in the first half of this year is that coal mines in various regions have relaxed their tunneling work, with a total of approximately 100,000 meters of tunneling tasks not completed. Due to the lack of sufficient prepared working faces, when some coal mines are affected by geological changes and major accidents, production has to be suspended or reduced, and the state plan cannot be completed. Some coal mines may even have their production affected next year as a result.

This lagging situation in tunneling work is the result of the insufficient understanding of the importance of tunneling work by leading cadres at all levels of coal mines, and the relaxation of leadership over tunneling work. Many coal mine cadres often lack foresight in their leadership work. They only seek to complete today's coal production tasks and do not know how to prepare for tomorrow's production by doing tunneling work. Sometimes, when the production target is not completed, they even reduce or stop tunneling, and transfer tunneling workers to rush coal mining. Although this approach completes or even exceeds the production target at that time, this "living off the old capital" approach sows the seeds of crisis for future production. Because of the lack of understanding of the importance of tunneling, the labor organization and technical conditions of tunneling work in various coal mines are also poorly improved. Tunneling teams are frequently transferred randomly. For example, a tunneling team in the Huainan Mining Bureau was transferred as many as six times in one month. The lack of technical and political backbones in tunneling teams is even more common.

Another important reason for the backwardness of tunneling work is that the production geological work in coal mines across China is generally not done well. Before liberation, China's coal mines were exploited under the plunder policy of imperialism and bureaucratic capital. They dug and mined haphazardly, grabbing whatever they could, so there was no geological work to speak of, and it was impossible to leave us any useful geological data. However, after liberation, coal mines in various regions did not strengthen geological work in a timely and serious manner, so that many mines have not yet clarified the geological structure, technical boundaries, and burial volume, which makes tunneling lack a correct direction and carries great blindness, resulting in continuous production interruptions or reductions. This situation occurs almost frequently, especially in Shandong and western Beijing, where geological conditions are complex.

The failure of coal mines in various regions to vigorously and conscientiously promote advanced experience in tunneling work, so that the level of tunneling work cannot be quickly improved, is also a serious reason for the current backwardness of tunneling work. In recent years, due to the study of advanced Soviet experience and the active creation of workers, many advanced experiences in tunneling work have emerged in coal mines across the country, such as the Ma Liuhai and Cui Guoshan tunneling team experiences, as well as large-hole blasting, hollow blasting, finished sheds, deep-hole operations, crack method, and water-air drills. These advanced experiences have played a great role in accelerating tunneling. However, because the leadership of coal mines in various regions does not pay enough attention, these advanced experiences have not been well consolidated and developed, and this year there is even a phenomenon of regression. According to the reflections of some coal mine labor models, many coal mines have not seriously conveyed some of the advanced experiences exchanged by labor models from various regions last year. Labor models from Shandong coal mines said that they did not know that there were so many advanced tunneling experiences at all.

In order to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy in coal mine enterprises, strive for a good turn in the production situation, and make full preparations for next year's production, vigorously strengthening tunneling work is the central link in the current coal mine work. To this end, the mining bureaus in various regions should first strengthen the leadership of tunneling work, so that leading cadres at all levels and all employees fully understand the importance of tunneling work, effectively reverse the tendency to neglect tunneling work and disorderly mining, and require a firm grasp of the balance between mining and tunneling, and maintain 25% of the prepared working faces. This requires improving the labor organization and technical conditions of tunneling work, equipping with backbones with a certain political and technical level, reasonably adjusting the wages of tunneling workers, and ensuring the timely supply of materials and vehicles, planning to solve the mechanical problems of tunneling, giving full play to mechanical efficiency, and promoting the mechanization of tunneling work. Tunneling workers and equipment tools should be fixed. Establish a regular tunneling meeting system, study and solve key problems in tunneling, pay attention to tunneling dispatch in production scheduling, strengthen the special responsibility system for tunneling, and strengthen the leadership of the tunneling area. A deputy mine director should be designated to be specifically responsible for tunneling work. The experience of the Beipiao Mining Bureau in reversing tunneling work has proved that these measures are very effective.

Second, we should strengthen production geological survey work to create better conditions for tunneling work. This requires quickly equipping production geological survey personnel, studying the situation of production mines, distinguishing the importance and urgency according to production requirements, and gradually and systematically clarifying the geological structure, technical boundaries, burial volume, etc., so as to plan the tunneling project and correctly calculate the amount of coal on the working face and the amount of coal prepared, correctly carry out planned management, grasp the balance between mining and tunneling, and prepare certain conditions for next year's production.

Third, we must vigorously promote advanced experience, which is the most effective way to accelerate tunneling progress. It is required to strengthen the leadership in promoting advanced experience, seriously organize tunneling teams to learn from the advanced experience of Ma Liuhai, Cui Guoshan, etc., earnestly organize technical personnel to help in a specific way, give play to the role of combining technology and labor, and consolidate and promote these advanced experiences. It is required that all tunneling faces promote finished sheds, promote hollow blasting and large-hole blasting methods, carry out deep-hole operations, and select suitable and efficient drilling methods according to the different conditions of the working face to improve efficiency.

### 加强煤矿掘进工作的领导

    加强煤矿掘进工作的领导
    煤矿的生产对象是埋藏在地层下面的煤层，要把这些煤开采出来，先要在地层下面开掘出采煤的工作场所，包括各种巷道和采煤工作面。为了使生产顺利进行，并不受意外事故的影响，就必须在煤矿生产之前做好以上各项掘进工作，使每个矿井有稳固的经常生产的采掘工作面及必须的后备工作面。只有做好了掘进工作，煤矿持续的均衡的生产才有保证；实行计划管理、提高劳动生产率、改善安全等等工作也才有可能实现。
    但现在我国各地煤矿中，却普遍存在着掘进工作落后于生产发展需要的严重状况，以致严重地影响了生产。今年上半年煤矿没有完成国家计划的重要原因之一，就是各地煤矿放松了掘进工作，掘进任务总共约有十万公尺没有完成。由于没有足够的准备工作面，有的煤矿受到地质变化和重大事故影响时，生产就只得停顿或减产，国家计划也就无法完成，有的煤矿甚至连明年的生产也将因此而受到影响。
    掘进工作的这种落后状况，是煤矿各级领导干部对掘进工作的重要性认识不足，放松了对掘进工作领导的结果。不少煤矿干部在领导工作上往往缺乏远见，他们只求完成今天的产煤任务，而不知为明天的生产做好掘进准备。有时，产量任务完不成时，甚至减少或停止掘进，把掘进工人调来突击采煤，这种做法当时虽然完成了甚至超额完成了产量任务，但这种“吃老本”的做法却为今后的生产种下了危机。由于对掘进的重要性认识不足，因此各地煤矿对掘进工作的劳动组织和技术条件的改善也做得很差，掘进队经常乱调动，例如淮南矿务局有一个掘进队一个月内竟被调动了六次之多。掘进队中缺乏技术上与政治上的骨干更是普遍现象。
    造成掘进工作落后的另一重要原因，是各地煤矿的生产地质工作普遍做得不好。我国的煤矿解放前是在帝国主义和官僚资本的掠夺政策下开采的，他们乱掘乱采，抢一点算一点，当然没有什么地质工作可言，也就不可能给我们留下什么可用的地质资料。但解放后，各地煤矿也没有及时地认真加强地质工作，以致到现在许多矿井都还没有弄清地质构造、技术边界及埋藏量，这就使得掘进没有正确的方向，带着很大的盲目性，以致不断发生生产中断或者减少等现象，这种情况特别是在山东和京西等地质条件复杂的矿井几乎是经常发生。
    各地煤矿在掘进工作中没有大力地认真地推广先进经验，以致掘进工作的水平不能很快提高，这也是目前掘进工作落后的一个严重原因。几年来由于学习苏联先进经验及工人们的积极创造，各地煤矿中曾出现了不少掘进工作的先进经验，如马六孩、崔国山掘进队经验及大眼爆破、空心爆破、成品棚子、深孔作业、龟裂法、水风钻等，这些先进经验对于加速掘进曾起了很大作用。但因各地煤矿领导上不够重视，这些先进经验没有得到很好的巩固和发展，今年更呈倒退现象。据有些煤矿劳动模范们反映，许多煤矿都没有认真传达去年各地劳动模范交流的一些先进经验，山东煤矿的劳动模范们说，他们竟完全不知道有这么多掘进的先进经验。
    为了实现煤矿企业增产节约的目标，争取生产情况的好转，并为明年的生产做好充分的准备，大力加强掘进工作是目前煤矿工作中的中心环节。为此，各地矿务局首先应加强对掘进工作的领导，要使各级领导干部和全体职工充分认识掘进工作的重要性，切实扭转忽视掘进工作和乱采乱掘的倾向，要求紧紧掌握采掘平衡，保持百分之二十五的准备工作面。这就要改善掘进工作的劳动组织及技术条件，配备具有一定的政治水平及技术水平的骨干，合理调整掘进工人的工资，并保证材料与车辆的及时供应，有计划地解决掘进用的机械问题，发挥机械效能，促进掘进工作的机械化。掘进工人及设备工具应固定化。建立定期的掘进会议制度，研究解决掘进中的关键性问题，在生产调度中注意掘进调度，加强掘进专责制，加强掘进区的领导，应指定一个副矿长专负责掘进工作。北票矿务局扭转掘进工作的经验证明了这些措施都是十分有效的。
    第二、应加强生产地质测量工作，为掘进工作创造更好的条件。这就要迅速配备生产地质测量人员，研究生产矿井情况，依生产要求分别轻重缓急，逐渐地有步骤地弄清地质构造、技术边界、埋藏量等，以便有计划地布置掘进工程和正确计算工作面煤量与准备煤量，正确地进行计划管理，掌握采掘平衡，为明年的生产准备一定的条件。
    第三、必须大力推广先进经验，这是加速掘进进度最有效的办法。要求加强推广先进经验的领导，认真组织掘进队学习马六孩、崔国山等先进经验，切实组织技术人员深入具体帮助，发挥技术与劳动相结合的作用，巩固与推广这些先进经验。要求所有掘进工作面推广成品棚子，推广空心爆破、大眼爆破法，进行深孔作业，并根据工作面的不同条件，选择适用的效率高的打眼方法，以提高效率。
