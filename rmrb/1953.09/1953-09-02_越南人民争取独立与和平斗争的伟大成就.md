　　The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, created by the Vietnamese people through a long revolutionary struggle, has traversed eight glorious years of history. In the just war against aggression, the Vietnamese people have consolidated and developed the victory of the August Revolution of 1945, defended the banner of the national liberation movement, and strengthened the cause of world peace and democracy. The international status of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has also been elevated. Today, people throughout the world who love peace, freedom, and justice are warmly congratulating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the brilliant achievements it has won over the past eight years.

　　What is the basic situation in Vietnam today? It is this: The French imperialists, who tore up the "Franco-Vietnamese Agreement" and perfidiously launched a colonial war, have suffered serious defeats. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese people have shattered the despicable plans of the French aggressors and American interventionists to re-enslave the Vietnamese people and turn Vietnam into an American military base, and have achieved great victories in the struggle for national liberation and the defense of peace.

　　From December 1946 to July 1953, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated more than 280,000 enemy troops and liberated a large part of the territory. In arduous and heroic battles, the People's Army has strengthened its equipment, technology, and combat effectiveness, and has grown into an armed force capable of conducting mobile warfare and siege warfare. The Vietnamese people support the People's Army with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, giving it an infinite source of mass strength. The democratic policies implemented by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the political, economic, and cultural fields have promoted the war of resistance of the patriotic people of all strata in Vietnam. In the vast Vietnamese liberated areas, the people's power, based on the alliance of workers and peasants and uniting people of all strata and all democratic parties, has been universally established and is developing and consolidating day by day. The People's Government has overcome various difficulties in finance and economy, created favorable conditions for developing production, and initially improved the material and cultural life of the masses. Particularly important is that the People's Government has implemented a land policy in the countryside to mobilize peasants against feudalism, which has played a profound role in the socio-economic development of Vietnam and the mobilization of the people's strength to resist the war. All these revolutionary achievements have become the fundamental guarantee for the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation to move towards final victory.

　　The victory of the Vietnamese national liberation war proves that the struggle of awakened nations to defend peace and freedom is invincible. Now is the time for the French ruling clique, which launched an unjust war, to learn the lessons it deserves from its own failures.

　　The French war against Vietnam has not only left a dirty history of the colonial system in Vietnam, but has also brought endless disasters to the French people. In this long and hopeless war, France has used about half of its national army, sacrificed the lives of hundreds of thousands of French soldiers, and spent three trillion francs. France's military budget is constantly increasing, the financial deficit has reached an alarming figure, and prices are rising rapidly with inflation. This year, French taxes account for 31 percent of national income, and the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in the country has reached 3.1 million. The war of aggression against Vietnam has greatly deepened France's financial and economic crisis, and the living conditions of the broad masses of the people are deteriorating. And the United States is precisely using these serious difficulties and weaknesses of France to step up its control and plunder of France, thereby deepening France's national crisis day by day. For several years, successive French governments have attempted to solve France's financial and political crisis without stopping the war in Vietnam, but the result has been the opposite. Countless facts prove that without stopping the war against Vietnam, France's political and economic crisis will become increasingly unalleviated.

　　The French working class and the French people, led by the French Communist Party, have carried out a long and arduous struggle with practical actions to oppose the war of aggression against Vietnam and to realize their demands on the Vietnam issue. The heroic deeds of peace fighters Henri Martin and Raymonde Dien are brilliant manifestations of the French people's indomitable will to oppose the Vietnam War and demand peace. At the recent French National Conference for Peace Negotiations, the French people continued to demand an end to the Vietnam War and launched a nationwide mass movement. French Communist Party Secretary Duclos recently commented on Henri Martin's release from prison, pointing out that "the forces against the Indochina War are growing day by day, and even government officials have been affected."

　　Not long ago, the French government crisis broke out, and Laniel said in his speech requesting authorization to form a cabinet: "My government will relentlessly seek opportunities to end this war." Bidault also said that his government "will use the Korean armistice as a lever to strive to end the war in Indochina." These words are of course promises they had to make in the face of the French people's urgent demand to end the Vietnam War, but in any case, this is enough to show that ending the Vietnam War is a common demand of all strata of the French people and some political figures.

　　However, the "new policy" implemented by the newly appointed French Laniel government on the Vietnam issue contradicts the promises he made to the French people himself. He announced that the French government will negotiate with the puppet regimes of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to grant them "complete independence and sovereignty." It is very clear that negotiating with puppets cannot end the war. This has nothing to do with the French people's demand to end the Vietnam War and the Vietnamese people's demand for peace and independence.

　　Why does the French government want to adopt such a "new policy"? It is not difficult for people to see that this is the result of the United States exerting pressure on France, and the Laniel government succumbing to this pressure.

　　When French Foreign Minister Bidault held a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France on July 10, he openly requested the United States to increase its economic assistance to France in order to implement a new military offensive plan in Vietnam. This plan attempts to forcibly conscript Vietnamese to expand the French aggressor army and delusionally seize the initiative on the Vietnamese battlefield. Dulles immediately supported this plan to accelerate and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. The communiqué of the three foreign ministers' meeting even used the so-called "the outcome of the Korean armistice must not endanger the restoration and guarantee of peace in other parts of Asia" as a smokescreen in an attempt to cover up this sinister plan of the US-French collusion, and claimed that the war of aggression against Vietnam was "very important" to the US, Britain, and France. Subsequently, the US Congress approved an appropriation of 400 million US dollars to France to continue the war in Vietnam. The US Department of Defense and the State Department saw that after the Korean armistice, the Vietnam War was the only large-scale ongoing war, so they tried their best to stir up the flames of war in Vietnam in order to create tension in the Far East.

　　These activities of the United States are obviously a continuation of its consistent policy of aggression against Vietnam. The United States has always borne 40% of the French military expenditure for aggression against Vietnam; it is only because of the support of the United States that France has been able to continue this war. People still remember that in his shameful statement on June 27, 1950, former US President Truman, in addition to announcing armed intervention in Korea, aggression against our country's Taiwan, and stepping up intervention in the Philippines, also announced stepping up aggression against Vietnam. Since then, American generals have regarded the Korean War and the Vietnam War as the United States' "double-barreled war" in Asia. Recently, the United States has continuously demanded France to internationalize the Vietnam War, demanding that the United States directly aid the Bao Dai puppet regime, directly participate in the war plan, and directly manipulate the command of the Vietnam War, in fact, it is to replace France's position in Vietnam and expand this war. These conspiracies of the American and French aggressors cannot but arouse stronger opposition from the Vietnamese people and the Asian people.

　　The eight-year history of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam shows that the United States' blatant intervention in Vietnam and its vigorous assistance to the French aggressors have not and cannot save the shameful failure of imperialism on Vietnamese soil. France can only climb out of the quagmire of the Vietnam War by following the principle of resolving international disputes in a spirit of consultation rather than by force.

　　People know that the Vietnamese people love peace. The arduous struggle they have waged against the French colonialists for the past eight years has been to build a peaceful and free life in their own motherland. The Asian people and the people of the whole world warmly expect and support the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to achieve greater achievements and victories in the struggle for national liberation and the defense of peace.

    越南人民争取独立与和平斗争的伟大成就
    越南人民经过长期的革命斗争而缔造的越南民主共和国，已经走过了八年光荣的历史道路。越南人民在反侵略的正义战争中，巩固并发展了一九四五年八月革命的胜利，捍卫了民族解放运动的旗帜，并加强了世界人民的和平民主事业。越南民主共和国的国际地位也随着提高了。今天，全世界爱好和平、自由与正义的人民，都在热烈地祝贺越南民主共和国八年来所赢得的光辉成就。
    目前越南的基本形势是什么呢？这就是：撕毁“法越协定”、背信弃义地发动了殖民战争的法帝国主义，已经遭到了严重的失败。在胡志明主席和越南劳动党的领导下，越南人民打破了法国侵略者和美国干涉者企图重新奴役越南人民并把越南变为美国军事基地的卑鄙计划，而取得了民族解放和保卫和平斗争的很大胜利。
    越南人民军自一九四六年十二月到一九五三年七月，共歼灭敌人二十八万余名，解放了很大部分的国土。人民军在艰苦而英勇的战斗中，增强了自己的装备、技术和战斗力，并成长为一支能够进行运动战和攻坚战的武装力量。越南人民以高度的爱国热忱支援人民军，使它获得群众力量的无穷泉源。越南民主共和国政府在政治、经济、文化各方面所实施的民主政策，促进了越南各阶层爱国人民的抗战事业。在广大的越南解放区，以工农联盟为基础、团结各阶层人民和各民主党派的人民政权，已经普遍建立，并且日益发展和巩固。人民政府克服了财政经济方面的种种困难，创造了发展生产的有利条件，初步改善了人民群众的物质和文化生活。特别重要的是，人民政府在农村中实行了发动农民反对封建主义的土地政策，对于越南的社会经济发展和人民抗战力量的发挥，起着深刻的作用。所有这些革命的成果，就成为越南人民争取民族解放斗争走向最后胜利的根本保证。
    越南民族解放战争的胜利证明，觉醒了的民族保卫和平与自由的斗争是不可战胜的。现在是发动不义战争的法国统治集团必须从自己的失败中得到应有的教训的时候了。
    法国对越南的战争，不仅在越南留下了殖民制度的肮脏的历史，而且给法国人民带来无穷的灾难。在这个长期的无望的战争中，法国已经动用了约占全国半数的军队，葬送了数十万法国士兵的生命，消耗了三万亿法郎的金钱。法国军事预算不断增加，财政赤字达到惊人数目，随着通货膨胀，物价迅速上涨。今年法国赋税竟占国民收入的百分之三十一，全国失业者和半失业者已达三百一十万人。侵略越南的战争极大地加深了法国的财政经济危机，使广大人民的生活条件越来越恶化。而美国正是利用法国的这些严重困难和弱点，步步加紧对法国的控制和劫夺，从而使法国的民族危机也日益深重了。数年以来，法国历届政府企图在不停止越南战争的情况下来解决法国的财政和政治危机问题，但是，结果却适得其反。无数的事实证明，不停止对越南的战争，法国的政治经济危机将愈来愈不能缓和。
    以法国共产党为领导的法国工人阶级和法国人民，为了反对侵越战争，为了实现自己对越南问题的主张，曾以实际行动进行了长期的顽强斗争。和平战士亨利·马丁与雷蒙达·第安的英勇事迹，就是法国人民反对越南战争，要求和平的不屈意志的光辉表现。在不久以前举行的法国争取和平谈判全国会议上，法国人民继续提出了结束越南战争的要求，并展开了全国性的群众运动。法国共产党书记杜克洛最近在评论亨利·马丁出狱时指出：“反对印度支那战争的力量在一天天增长，甚至政府人士都受到了影响。”
    不久以前，法国政府危机爆发，拉尼埃在要求授权组阁的演说中说：“我的政府将毫不松懈地寻求结束这个战争的机会。”皮杜尔也说他的政府“将把朝鲜停战作为一根杠杆，努力用来结束在印度支那的战争。”这些话当然是他们在法国人民迫切要求结束越南战争的情势下不得不做的许诺，但这无论如何足以说明结束越南战争是法国各阶层人民和一些政界人士的共同主张。
    然而新上台的法国拉尼埃政府，对越南问题所实行的“新政”，却和他自己向法国人民所做的许诺相矛盾。他宣布法国政府将和越南、高棉、寮国的傀儡政权进行谈判，使它们获得“完整的独立与主权”。事情很明白，和傀儡们进行谈判，是不可能结束战争的。这和法国人民要求结束越南战争以及越南人民要求和平与独立，是毫不相干的。
    为什么法国政府要采取这样的“新政”呢？人们都不难看到，这是美国向法国行使压力，而拉尼埃政府屈服于这种压力的结果。
    法国外长皮杜尔在七月十日举行美英法三国外长会议时，公开要求美国增加对法国的经济援助，以便在越南实行新的军事进攻计划。这个计划企图强迫征调越南人以扩充法国侵略军，并妄想夺取越南战场上的主动权。杜勒斯立即支持了这个加速进行和扩大侵越战争的计划。三外长会议公报竟以所谓“朝鲜停战的结果绝不得危及亚洲其他地方和平的恢复与保障”为烟幕，企图用以掩盖美法密谋的这个罪恶计划，并声称侵略越南的战争对美英法“是十分重要的”。接着，美国国会就批准给法国四亿美元的拨款，用来继续进行越南战争。美国国防部和国务院看到，朝鲜停战后，越南战争是唯一大规模的现行战争了，于是就来竭力煽动越南的战火，以制造远东的紧张局势。
    美国的这些活动显然是它对越南的一贯侵略政策的继续。美国一直就负担了法国侵越军费的百分之四十；只是由于美国的支持，法国才能把这个战争继续下来。人们都还记得，前美国总统杜鲁门在一九五○年六月二十七日的可耻声明中，除了宣布武装干涉朝鲜、侵略我国台湾和加紧干涉菲律宾外，同时又宣布加紧侵略越南。从此以后，美国将军们就把朝鲜战争和越南战争看作美国在亚洲的
    “双管战争”。近来美国不断地向法国要求把越南战争国际化，要求由美国直接援助保大傀儡，直接参加作战计划，直接操纵对越南战争的指挥权，实际上就是要代替法国在越南的地位，并扩大这个战争。美国和法国侵略者的这些阴谋，不能不引起越南人民和亚洲人民更加强烈的反对。
    越南民主共和国的八年历史说明，美国对越南的露骨干涉和对法国侵略者的大力援助，并没有、也不能挽救帝国主义在越南土地上的可耻失败。法国只有按照用协商精神而非用武力解决国际争端的原则，才能使法国从越南战争的泥沼中爬出来。
    人们知道，越南人民是爱好和平的，八年来他们所进行的反对法国殖民者的艰苦斗争，就是为了在自己的祖国建立和平与自由的生活。亚洲人民和全世界人民都热烈期望和支持越南民主共和国在争取民族解放和保卫和平的斗争中获得更伟大的成就和胜利。
