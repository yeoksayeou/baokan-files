    Eliminate Chaos in Survey and Statistical Work
    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has announced the "Directive on Clearing Existing Survey and Statistical Forms and Prohibiting the Random Issuance of Survey and Statistical Forms." This directive is an important document for overcoming the chaotic phenomena in survey and statistical work and strengthening survey and statistical work to meet the needs of planned economic construction. Governments at all levels and all business departments should, in accordance with this directive, conscientiously clear and control survey and statistical forms, eliminate the current chaotic state of survey and statistical work, improve the planning of survey and statistical work, and ensure that existing forces are used to do a good job of the survey and statistical work necessary for national planned economic construction.
    Over the past three years, governments at all levels and various business departments have conducted many important surveys and statistics, collected some necessary statistical data, trained a group of survey and statistical cadres, and locally (mainly in the state-owned economy) established a simple statistical reporting system, providing some necessary conditions for future planned economic construction. On the other hand, due to the rapid development of work in various regions and departments, there are many new things that need to be understood; a large proportion of cadres still lack work experience, and some leading cadres, although having some work experience, have adopted simple coping methods in the face of complex new things, resulting in intolerable chaotic phenomena in survey and statistics, which is particularly serious in rural areas. In rural areas, forms are rampant, many forms have complex items, contents are mutually repetitive, and even various absurd and naive requirements are put forward, wasting countless manpower and materials, which has become a heavy burden for cadres at all levels, and has created a bad influence among the masses, hindering normal production work and other important tasks.
    Why has this chaotic phenomenon occurred in survey and statistical work? The directive of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government clearly pointed out that it is "due to certain organs using subjectivism, decentralism, and bureaucracy to conduct surveys and statistics." Many of our organs, many cadres, when formulating forms and indicators, want to survey and statistically analyze everything, and require detailed reporting of everything. They have not thought about how much manpower and materials it will cost to fill in so many forms and indicators seriously? And whether the reported figures are correct? Whether they have practical utility? Not considering the necessity and practical possibility of the work, relying solely on subjective wishes, and not adopting appropriate methods for survey and statistics based on specific objects and specific conditions, is the main manifestation of subjectivism in the current survey and statistics.
    Organizational decentralism is also an important reason for the chaotic phenomenon in statistical work. Although the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a decision on unified leadership of statistical work in January this year, the unified leadership system for statistical work has not yet been seriously established. Many organs do not contact each other, nor do they go through approval procedures, and each issues its own set of survey and statistical forms. Even the various departments of the same organ lack unified leadership, and often send people to the same organ to demand data separately, or repeatedly arrange survey and statistical forms with the same content, which causes duplication and waste of survey and statistics. A factory or a rural area can receive dozens or hundreds of forms from many organs, the contents are mutually repetitive, and the survey scope, indicator explanations, and calculation methods are inconsistent, so that many different figures are produced for the same indicator, and they are reported upwards.
    Bureaucratic working methods have further increased the severity of the above-mentioned chaotic phenomena. Many comrades do not treat scientific survey and statistical work with a serious and responsible attitude, but with a very perfunctory attitude. The design of forms does not go through careful research, so many forms cannot be filled in, or because each has its own survey scope and calculation method, it is impossible to comprehensively compare them when they are reported. Many organs only care about randomly issuing forms, and do not consider organizing and researching them. After the data is reported, it is shelved. Even discarded at will, and when there is a need, forms are issued again. Many organs, despite the existence of readily available data, do not organize and research it, but still demand it from below in many ways, without considering the difficulties below.
    In order to overcome the above-mentioned chaotic phenomena, and to quickly reduce unnecessary burdens on lower levels, the existing statistical forms should be conscientiously cleared in the spirit of inspecting subjectivism, decentralism, and bureaucracy. However, if the clearing of statistical forms does not have the practical leadership of governments at all levels and the close cooperation of various business departments, it will not achieve good results. Therefore, it is required to establish a responsibility system at all levels and a division of labor responsibility system, requiring governments at all levels and various business departments to clear the survey and statistical forms issued by various regions and departments in the past, by region and by system, with a serious and responsible attitude, and to abolish all unnecessary and impossible forms to fill in.
    It should be recognized that our economic construction has just begun, and in order to implement planned management, the requirements for statistical data from all aspects are naturally very urgent. However, the current statistical work foundation is weak and far from meeting the needs of all aspects. Therefore, when issuing survey and statistical forms, we must carefully consider what statistical data is urgently needed for national construction, and what is not very needed, or completely unnecessary. It should be recognized that issuing one more form, or adding an indicator in the form, will more or less increase the burden on cadres and the people. Even for statistical data that is very necessary, we should consider whether the lower levels have the strength to fill it in. Otherwise, "the top demands randomly, and the bottom creates randomly," which is a waste of manpower and resources, and still does not achieve the purpose of survey and statistics. At present, there are still five different economic components in our country. For various economic components, our planned statistical work must put forward different requirements and adopt different methods. For example, the statistics of private industrial and commercial enterprises must be clearly distinguished from the statistics of state-owned enterprises; in rural areas, the characteristics of small-scale peasant economy should be grasped, and it is impossible and unnecessary to conduct overly complex surveys and statistics on agricultural production and farmers' activities, and the census method should not be abused. If survey and statistics are carried out subjectively, it will not only arouse farmers' opposition, but may also have a destructive effect on agricultural production.
    While clearing statistical forms, a unified leadership system for statistical work must be established. All survey and statistical reports must be reviewed and approved by governments or statistical agencies at all levels in accordance with the prescribed procedures. The directive of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government pointed out that in the past, "governments, statistical departments, and various business departments at all levels did not strictly manage survey and statistical work, and the examination and approval system for survey and statistical reports was not seriously and thoroughly established, so that the state of anarchy in statistical work continued to spread and failed to be quickly prevented." Therefore, statistical agencies at all levels must, under the leadership of the government at the same level, be responsible for strictly managing and supervising and inspecting all survey and statistical work, and should earnestly implement the examination and approval system for survey and statistical reports approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. Anyone has the right to refuse to fill in any form that has not been legally approved, and statistical agencies at all levels and all statistical cadres should be responsible for exposing and conducting an uncompromising struggle against this state of anarchy in statistical work.
    The directive of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government also pointed out that "while clearing survey and statistical forms, governments at all levels and various business departments must attach importance to survey and statistical work, and effectively complete the survey and statistical tasks stipulated by the state; prevent tendencies such as not attaching importance to survey and statistical work due to the clearing of survey and statistical forms, and resisting and coping with survey and statistical tasks stipulated by the state." It should be recognized that the purpose of prohibiting the random issuance of survey and statistical forms is to strengthen survey and statistical work, not to weaken survey and statistical work. In order to better organize and lead the national survey and statistical work, it is necessary to further strengthen statistical institutions, conscientiously and gradually establish a scientific statistical system, and conduct systematic and practical ideological and political education and business education for statistical cadres. Only in this way can we gradually bring survey and statistical work onto the right track, and enable statistical work to complete its due tasks in planned economic construction.

### 消灭调查统计工作中的混乱现象

    消灭调查统计工作中的混乱现象
    中央人民政府政务院公布了“关于清理现行调查统计表格及禁止乱发调查统计表格的指示”，这一指示是克服调查统计工作中的混乱现象，加强调查统计工作以适应有计划的经济建设需要的一个重要文件。各级政府及各业务部门应该根据这一指示，认真清理并控制调查统计表格，消灭调查统计工作目前所存在的混乱状态，提高调查统计工作的计划性，保证以现有的力量做好国家计划经济建设所必需的调查统计工作。
    三年多来，各级政府及各业务部门，曾分别做了许多重要的调查统计，收集了一些必要的统计资料，培养了一批调查统计干部，局部地（主要是在国营经济部分）建立了简单的统计报告制度，为今后有计划的经济建设提供了一些必要的条件。另一方面，由于各地区、各部门的工作发展迅速，需要了解的新事物很多；有很大一部分干部还缺乏工作经验，也有一部分领导干部虽然有些工作经验，但在复杂的新事物面前却采取了简单应付的办法，以致在调查统计方面产生了不可容忍的混乱现象，这种现象在农村里尤为严重。各地农村表格泛滥，许多表格项目繁杂，内容互相重复，甚至提出了各种荒唐幼稚的要求，浪费了无数人力物力，既成为各级干部的沉重负担，并在群众中造成恶劣的影响，妨碍生产工作及其它重要工作的正常进行。
    调查统计工作为什么会产生这种混乱现象呢？中央人民政府政务院的指示中明白指出，是“由于某些机关用主观主义、分散主义、官僚主义的方法来进行调查统计”。我们许多机关，许多干部，在制定表格和指标时，样样东西都要调查统计，样样要求详细填报。他们没有想一想，这样多的表格和指标都要认真填报，究竟要耗费多少人力物力？而填报上来的数字是否正确？是否都有实际效用？不考虑工作的必要性和实践的可能性，单凭主观愿望，不根据具体对象具体条件来采用适当的方法进行调查统计，就是目前调查统计中主观主义的主要表现。
    组织上的分散主义也是造成统计工作混乱现象的重要原因。虽然中央人民政府政务院在今年一月即已颁发统计工作统一领导的决定，但统计工作的统一领导制度，到现在还没有认真建立起来。许多机关互不联系，亦不经过审批手续，各自颁发一套套的调查统计表格。甚至同一机关的各个部门也缺乏统一领导，往往分别派人到同一机关要索资料，或重复布置同样内容的调查统计表格，这样就造成调查统计的重复浪费。一个工厂，一个农村可以接到从许多机关发来的几十、几百种表格，内容互相重复，调查范围、指标解释及计算方法又互不一致，以致同一指标产生许多不同的数字，纷纷向上报送。
    官僚主义的工作方法，更增加了上述混乱现象的严重程度。许多同志不用认真负责的态度，而用十分草率的态度来对待科学的调查统计工作，设计表格不经过认真研究，因此许多表格无法填报，或者报来了因各有各的调查范围，各有各的计算方法，无法综合比较。许多机关只管乱发表格，并不考虑整理研究，资料报来了即束置高阁。甚至随要随丢，再有需要时即再发表格。许多机关尽管存在着现成可用的资料，但不加以整理研究，却仍然多方面地向下面索要，毫不考虑下面的困难。
    为着克服上述混乱现象，为了迅速减轻下级不必要的负担，应该以检查主观主义、分散主义和官僚主义的精神来认真清理现行统计表格。但清理统计表格如果没有各级政府的切实领导，及各业务部门的通力合作，也是不会获得良好效果的。所以要求建立各级负责和分工负责制度，要求各级政府及各业务部门，按地区按系统，用认真负责的态度来清理各地区各部门过去所颁发的调查统计表格，废止一切不需要与不可能填报的表格。
    应当认识：我国经济建设刚刚开始，为着实行计划管理，各方面对统计资料的要求自然十分迫切。但目前统计工作基础薄弱，远不能满足各方面的要求。因而在颁发调查统计表格时，必须慎重考虑，究竟什么统计资料是国家建设所迫切需要的，什么是并非十分需要，或者完全不需要的。要认识多发一张表格，或在表格中间增加一个指标，就要或多或少加重干部和人民的负担。即使是十分需要的统计资料，亦应该考虑下面究竟有无力量填报。否则
    “上面乱要，下面乱造”，徒然劳民伤财，仍达不到调查统计的目的。现在我国还存在着五种不同的经济成分，对于各种经济成分，我们的计划统计工作必须提出不同的要求，并采用不同的方法。如对私营工商业的统计，必须与对国营企业的统计有明确的区别；在农村中更应该掌握小农经济的特点，对农业生产及农民活动不可能、亦不需要进行过分复杂的调查统计，更不能滥用普查方法。如果主观主义地进行调查统计，则不但会引起农民反对，且可能对农业生产起破坏作用。
    与清理统计表格同时，必须建立统计工作的统一领导制度，所有调查统计报表必须按照规定手续，经各级政府或统计机关审查批准。中央人民政府政务院的指示中指出，过去“各级政府、统计部门及各业务部门对于调查统计工作管理不严，调查统计报表的审批制度并未认真地、周密地建立起来，以致统计工作的无政府状态得以继续蔓延，未能迅速防止”。因此各级统计机关必须在同级政府的领导下，负责严格管理和监督检查一切调查统计工作，应该按照中央人民政府政务院批准的调查统计报表的审批制度，认真贯彻。一切未经依法批准的表格，任何人都有权拒绝填报，各级统计机关及全体统计干部且应负责揭发，与这种统计工作的无政府状态进行不妥协的斗争。
    中央人民政府政务院的指示中又指出，“与清理调查统计表格同时，各级政府及各业务部门必须重视调查统计工作，切实完成国家所规定的调查统计任务；防止因清理调查统计表格而可能发生对调查统计工作不重视，以及对国家所规定的调查统计任务抗拒应付等类偏向”。应该认识：禁止乱发调查统计表格目的是为加强调查统计工作，而不是为削弱调查统计工作。为着更好地来组织和领导全国的调查统计工作，必须进一步加强统计机构，认真地逐步地建立科学的统计制度，并对统计干部进行系统的、切合实际的思想政治教育和业务教育。只有如此，才能把调查统计工作逐渐纳入正轨，才能使统计工作在有计划的经济建设中完成其应完成的任务。
