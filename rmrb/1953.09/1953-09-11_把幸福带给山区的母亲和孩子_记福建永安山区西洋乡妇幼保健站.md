Bringing Happiness to Mothers and Children in Mountainous Areas
    ——A Story of the Xiyang Township Maternal and Child Health Station in Yong'an Mountainous Area, Fujian
    Ye Ding
    Xiyang Township is a village in the mountainous area of Yong'an, Fujian Province, surrounded by mountains, with scattered villages. In the past, there was an extreme lack of medical and health facilities. When farmers got sick, they often could not get timely treatment; the health and lives of women and children were even more frequently threatened.
    In August of last year, the People's Government established a maternal and child health station here, which brought about a major change in the health of mothers and children in Xiyang Township.
    In June of this year, I visited this health station. In a spacious and clean courtyard, there were separate delivery rooms, nurseries, recuperation rooms, pharmacies, etc. On the whitewashed walls hung colorful pictures of maternal and child health knowledge and patriotic health campaigns. The delivery room was equipped with a delivery bed covered with white cloth, a stethoscope, a sterilizer, and surgical instruments. The maternity recuperation room had brand-new furniture, brand-new mosquito nets, and brand-new bedding. This new facility in a mountainous rural area gave people an impression of cleanliness, freshness, and orderliness everywhere.
    Here, people can often see pregnant women coming for prenatal check-ups; some bring their children to see a doctor, requesting the health station to check their temperature and apply medicine; sometimes there are also mothers who come from afar, carrying their children, bringing local fruits and produce to visit the working comrades of the health station.

    "One foot in the coffin, one foot outside the coffin," the mountainous women will never forget the pain of childbirth that the old society brought them. In the past, people thought that childbirth was a dirty and ugly thing. During labor, the parturient women were not allowed to go to bed, some knelt, and some squatted on the ground; if the placenta did not come out, people would put tung oil on the hair comb and feed it to the parturient women to make them vomit and exert force; dirty scissors and broken bowl pieces were used to cut the umbilical cord. There was a parturient woman named Luo Yue in Xiyang Township. Because the placenta did not come out, the old midwife tied straw sandals to the umbilical cord, put a brick into the stove to burn it red, poured vinegar on it, and asked the parturient woman to squat on the brick, trying to use this sour gas to induce the child to be born. The result was still ineffective. What to do? The old midwife finally had to use her long, dirty fingernails to pull hard, causing both the adult and the child to die. The traditional feudal customs and terrible old-fashioned midwifery in old China cast a shadow of terror on the hearts of women. Countless mothers and babies died of puerperal fever and tetanus! Those who lived often suffered from incurable diseases for life. The children, due to the hard life and poor care, were reduced to skin and bones. At that time, according to the local people, "Children suffer when they can't be born, and they suffer when they live!"

    "Go to the countryside, change unreasonable midwifery methods, establish scientific methods, relieve women's pain of childbirth, and protect the health of our next generation!" According to this spirit, the People's Government sent an assistant midwife in April 1952. However, at the beginning, she encountered strong ideological resistance from the women: "You are so young and have never given birth to a child, what do you know about midwifery!" She was even scolded during prenatal check-ups. However, the assistant midwife was not discouraged and visited door to door, patiently explaining the reasons to the women. When she saw that their children had sores, she would wash them and apply medicine. One day, Wu Cheng, a parturient woman in a village, fainted due to retained placenta caused by old-fashioned midwifery, bleeding non-stop. Her family members were crying, and the old midwife stood aside, unable to come up with an idea. At this time, the family members, seeing that the parturient woman had no hope of survival, asked the assistant midwife to try. At the critical moment, the assistant midwife rushed to the scene overnight, and used manual removal to remove the placenta and injected the parturient woman with a cardiotonic. This parturient woman, who had escaped death, was finally rescued. Wu Cheng said with tears in her eyes: "Comrade, if you hadn't come to rescue me, I would have lost my life!" Another time, the baby born to parturient woman Lin Xiulian had "pseudo-death" due to prolonged labor. His family members thought he was really dead and were disheartened. But the assistant midwife calmly picked up the baby's feet, pointed his head downwards, gently patted his back a few times, and then moved his head. The baby's nose fluttered twice, and he cried out "Wow!" Lin Xiulian's mother-in-law, who was over sixty years old, was shocked when she saw this scene: "Oh! I used to see how many children were buried like this, these children died too unjustly!" These examples spread quickly in the countryside. Soon, women from Nan Hanyang, eight miles away from Xiyang Township, and Chengjiashan, fifteen miles away, voluntarily requested to use the new midwifery method.

    Living facts educated the women. The work situation opened up, and in August, this health station was established amidst the laughter of the women.

    In mountainous areas, villages are scattered, and villages are often more than ten miles apart. Apart from self-delivery, women have to rely on local old midwives to give birth. Transforming these old midwives, instilling scientific knowledge, teaching them the new midwifery method, and continuing to serve women in mountainous areas is an important task in rural maternal and child health work.

    After the establishment of the Xiyang Township Health Station, from December 1952 to April of this year, old midwives were concentrated in Xiaoluo, Fuzhuang, and Neilu townships for preliminary training. At first, the elderly old midwives heard the principles of the new midwifery method and thought they were as incompatible as fire and water. However, they personally saw the assistant midwife repeatedly saving dying parturient women and rescuing "pseudo-dead" babies. In the face of the truth, they went from doubt to belief, and from belief to admiration. In this way, some of them voluntarily signed up, and some participated in the training class with a "try and see" mentality.

    In the classroom, lacking models, the assistant midwife used cloth to make babies, and used real objects such as scissors and umbilical cord thread to explain the entire process of midwifery; she also used posters to explain in detail the unreasonableness of the old midwifery method and the benefits of the new midwifery method. The assistant midwives did it once, and they learned it the same way; they went with them during midwifery and let them pay attention to every action. This allowed them to be educated through practice. "How silly!" Once, an old midwife couldn't help but exclaimed after listening to the principles of the new midwifery method: "In the past, I always thought that parturient women had to squat when giving birth so that the dirty blood could flow out clearly and would not get sick. Today I know that this will kill people." Liu Xiuying, an old midwife who was sixty years old, said: "In the past, I used dirty scissors to cut the umbilical cord, and when the child died, I blamed the parturient woman for having a bad life."

    After the end of the study, they all signed a "midwifery covenant" to ensure that they would do their job well. They became assistants to the health station and reported their work to the health station every month. Hu Xing, who was over fifty years old, used the new method to deliver fifteen babies safely. She made postpartum visits for every child she delivered. She also actively mobilized pregnant women to go to the health station for prenatal check-ups. By May of this year, they had delivered sixty-seven babies using the new method, and there had been no cases of puerperal fever or tetanus.

    Many superstitious and unhygienic infant-rearing customs are circulating in the mountainous areas. When children get sick, they do not ask doctors for treatment, but ask the Bodhisattva for "blessings"; when infants develop thrush, they use needles to prick it, causing it to bleed non-stop; some people do not bathe or change clothes for their children for a long time, often causing ulcers to develop between the infants' thighs and armpits. In order to protect the health of the next generation, the assistant midwives and health workers of the health station vigorously publicized new infant care methods. They often carried medicine boxes, climbed mountains and ridges, and went deep into the homes of parturient women to check the health of the parturient women, the amount of milk, and the temperature and weight of the infants. If they found that the infants had problems, they would advise them not to seek gods or ask witches, but to find ways to ask doctors for treatment; sometimes they would do it themselves. After the child of Liao Fuxing, a woman in Xiyang Township, was born, both eyes were red and swollen like goldfish eyes due to gonorrhea bacteria invasion, and pus was flowing every day, and the oral cavity was also inflamed. Her family members said that the child was useless. After their visit, they washed the child's eyes, applied medicine, and injected "penicillin", saving the child's life. Once, when visiting the home of parturient woman Pan Xian, the parturient woman was sick in bed, the infant's body was ulcerated, and no one took care of him. They boiled water themselves, bathed the infant, and applied medicine. Pan Xian said with tears in her eyes: "Only the People's Government cares about the suffering of our women like this!"

    In this way, the health station gradually established close ties with the masses. On the road and in the mountains, when women encountered the assistant midwife of the health station, they would hold hands and affectionately shout "Comrade!" They often took things that they were reluctant to eat themselves to entertain the assistant midwife. It is precisely because of this that the superstitions and unhygienic habits passed down from generation to generation in the mountainous areas have gradually been replaced by scientific hygiene. In the past, mothers who lacked milk often chewed the rice and spat it into the baby's mouth. Now, many women have changed this habit; they also understand the benefits of bathing the baby regularly, and they know how to use vegetable juice, tofu, and flour to increase the baby's nutrition. When it's hot and adults sweat, they wash their nipples clean before breastfeeding.

    把幸福带给山区的母亲和孩子
    ——记福建永安山区西洋乡妇幼保健站
    野丁
    一西洋乡是福建省永安山区的一个村庄，四面群山环抱，村落分散。过去，这里极端缺乏医药卫生设备，农民有了病，往往得不到及时的治疗；妇女和儿童的健康和生命，更经常遭受着威胁。
    去年八月间，人民政府在这儿建立了一所妇幼保健站，使西洋乡的妇幼健康状况起了大的变化。
    今年六月间，我访问了这个保健站。在一所宽敞、清洁的院子里，分设着产房、婴儿室、疗养房、药房等。粉刷得白白的墙上挂着有关妇幼卫生常识和爱国卫生运动的五彩图片。产房里安置一张盖着白布的产床，这里有听筒、消毒器和做手术用的器具；产妇疗养房里有崭新的家具、崭新的蚊帐、崭新的被褥。这个山区农村的新设施，处处给人以整洁、新鲜、有条理的印象。
    在这里，人们经常能看到怀孕的妇女们来做产前检查；有的带孩子到这儿来看病，要求保健站验体温、敷药；有时还有一些远道赶来的母亲，抱着孩子，携带着乡里的水果和土产来探望保健站的工作同志。二
    “一脚在棺材里，一脚在棺材外”，山区妇女们永远忘不了旧社会带给她们的生育的痛苦。以前，人们认为生孩子是又脏又丑的事情。生产时，产妇不能上床，有的跪着，有的蹲在地上；胎盘不下，人们就在头梳上抹着桐油给产妇吃，使她呕吐、用力；剪脐带时用脏剪刀、破碗片。西洋乡有个产妇叫罗月，因为胎盘不下，旧产婆用草鞋绑在脐带上，拿一块砖头放到灶里烧红后，泼上醋，叫产妇蹲在砖头上，想借这种酸气把孩子催生下来。结果仍然无效。怎么办呢？旧产婆最后只好用那只指甲又长又脏的手，硬扯硬拉，弄得大人小孩都死掉了。旧中国传统的封建习俗和可怕的旧法接生，在妇女们的心上罩上一层恐怖的阴影。死于产褥热和破伤风的母亲和婴儿不知有多少！活着的，也常因此染上终身不治的病症。孩子呢，也因为生活苦，保育不好，弄得皮包着骨头。那时候，照当地群众的说法：“孩子生不出受罪，活着也受罪！”三
    “到农村中去，改变不合理的接生方法，树立科学的方法，解除妇女生产的痛苦，保护我们下一代的健康！”根据这种精神，人民政府一九五二年四月间派来了一个助产士。但是，一开始她就碰到妇女们强烈的思想抗拒：“你年纪轻轻的，又没生过孩子，懂得什么接生！”进行产前检查时，甚至遭到痛骂。然而，助产士并不灰心，挨家挨户地去访问，苦口婆心地对妇女们讲道理。见到她们的孩子身上有烂疮了，就替他洗，敷上药。有一天，下乡村的产妇吴成，因为旧法接生，胎盘被阻，流血不止而昏过去，家里人哭哭啼啼，旧产婆呆在一旁，拿不出主意。这时，家里人看到产妇已没有活的希望，就叫助产士去试一试。正在危急的关头，助产士连夜赶到了，用人工剥离法，剥离了胎盘，给产妇注射了强心针。这个九死一生的产妇终于被救活过来了。吴成流着泪说：“同志，要不是你来救，我这条命活不成了！”又有一次，产妇林秀莲生下的婴儿，因产程过长，发生“假死症”。他家里人以为真死了，心灰意冷。但助产士不慌不忙地把婴儿的两脚掂起，头向下，在背上轻轻拍了几拍，又搬着头，只见婴儿的鼻子搧了两搧，“哇！”的一声哭起来了。林秀莲那六十多岁的婆婆看到这情形，不禁大吃一惊：“哎呀！从前我看到多少孩子就这样被埋掉，这些孩子真死得太冤枉啊！”这些事例一传十，十传百，很快地在乡间传开来。不久，离西洋乡八里路的南瀚洋和十五里的程家山，妇女们都自动来请求用新法接生。
    活生生的事实教育了妇女们。工作局面打开了，八月间，这所保健站在妇女们的欢笑声中成立了。四
    山区里，村落分散，村与村之间往往相隔十多里路，妇女们生孩子除了自接，只好靠当地的旧产婆。把这些旧产婆加以改造，灌输科学知识，使她们学会新接生法，继续为山区妇女服务，是乡村妇幼卫生工作中一项重要的工作。
    西洋乡保健站建立后，从一九五二年十二月至今年四月，先后在小螺、福庄、内炉等乡，集中旧产婆进行了初步的训练。上了年纪的旧产婆们，起先听到新接生法的道理，像水火一样不相容。但是，她们亲眼看到助产士历次救活了垂死的产妇，救活了“假死”的婴儿，在真理面前，她们从怀疑到相信，从相信到钦佩。就这样，她们有的自动报了名，有的抱着“试试看”的心情，参加了训练班。
    课堂中，缺乏模型，助产士用布制成婴儿，用剪刀、脐带线等实物，来说明接生的整个过程；又用挂图详尽地说明了旧接生法的不合理和新接生法的好处。助产士们做了一遍，她们照样学一遍；接生时和她们一道去，让她们在旁边留心每一个动作。这样就使她们从实践中受到了教育。“多么傻呀！”有一次，一个旧产婆在听了新接生法的道理以后，情不自禁地叫起来：“过去我总以为产妇生孩子时得蹲着，才能使脏血流清，不会生病，今天我知道这会害死人。”六十岁的旧产婆刘秀英说：“从前用脏剪刀断脐带，孩子死了，我还怪产妇命不好。”
    学习结束后，她们都订了“接生公约”，保证把工作做好。她们成了保健站的助手，每月向保健站汇报自己的工作情况。五十多岁的胡兴，用新法接了十五胎，平平安安。她每接生一个孩子，都作了产后访视。她还积极动员孕妇到保健站来进行产前检查。到今年五月间，她们用新法接生了六十七个婴儿，没有发生过产褥热和破伤风。五
    山区里流传着许多迷信和不卫生的育婴习俗。孩子生了病，不请医生治疗，而求菩萨“保佑”；婴儿嘴巴生鹅口疮用针刺，刺得流血不止；有的人长久不给小孩洗澡、换衣，常使婴儿股间、腋下发生溃烂。为了保护后一代的健康，保健站的助产士、保健员们大力宣传了新育儿法。她们常常背着药箱，爬山越岭，深入到产妇家里，看看产妇的健康状况、奶量，检查婴儿的体温、体重。发现婴儿有毛病，就劝告她们不要求神、请巫婆，要设法请医生医治；有时她们也自己动手来医。西洋乡妇女廖福兴的孩子生下后，两只眼睛因淋病菌侵入，红肿得像金鱼的眼睛一样，天天流脓，口腔又发炎。家里人说这孩子不中用了。她们访视后，给孩子洗眼睛，敷药，还给注射了“盘尼西林”，把这个孩子救活过来。有一次，访视到产妇潘先家里时，产妇病在床上，婴儿全身溃烂，没有人照顾。她们自己烧开水，给婴儿洗澡、敷药。潘先眼眶里含着热泪说：“只有人民政府才这样关心我们妇女的痛苦啊！”
    这样，保健站就逐渐和群众建立起紧密的联系。路上、山上，妇女们遇到保健站的助产士，就拉着手，亲切地喊着“同志！”她们常常拿自己舍不得吃的东西来招待助产士。也正因为这样，山区里世代相传的迷信、不卫生的习惯，也渐渐地被科学卫生所代替。以前，缺奶的母亲们，往往把饭嚼碎后吐到婴儿嘴里，如今，许多妇女已经改变这种习惯；她们也懂得经常给婴儿洗澡的好处，懂得用菜浆、豆腐、面粉来增加婴儿的营养。天热，大人身上出汗，她们先把奶头洗干净然后喂奶。
