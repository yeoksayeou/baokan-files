Shanxi's enterprises and institutions began to handle stagnant materials in June, and some units have already made some progress.

In mid-June, the Shanxi Provincial Finance and Economics Committee convened a meeting of 35 units, including state-owned and local state-owned enterprises, to study the handling of stagnant materials in various enterprises. At the meeting, it was learned that the total value of materials stockpiled in various enterprises throughout the province was over 280 billion yuan. The stockpiled materials include various machinery, tools, hardware of all sizes, cement, railway special equipment, postal and telecommunications special equipment, electrical equipment, engine oil, civil engineering materials, auto parts, lead wire, glass, and many other types. The vast majority of these materials are usable, some can be used after processing and repair, and a very small portion cannot be used due to prolonged stockpiling and needs to be scrapped. Some units' stockpiled materials are exactly what other units urgently need. For example, the Provincial Electric Power Bureau has a batch of stockpiled cement and sealant, while the Provincial Engineering Bureau needs cement, and the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant needs sealant. These materials were immediately adjusted.

The meeting stipulated the principles and prices for handling stagnant materials and decided that the Taiyuan, Datong, and Yangquan Municipal Finance and Economics Committees would organize stagnant materials processing centers respectively. Except for materials that are uniformly distributed by the state, general materials can be taken to the stagnant materials processing centers for trading. In addition, it was decided to organize mutual visits to warehouses by various enterprises and institutions to carry out adjustment and allocation.

In the past three months, many enterprises and institutions have taken active steps to handle stagnant materials. Taiyuan, Datong, and Yangquan have all organized stagnant materials processing centers, and many factories and mines have organized visits to warehouses. So far, the province has handled stagnant materials worth approximately 20.7 billion yuan. The materials handled by the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau account for 63 percent of the total amount of stagnant materials, the Provincial Transportation Bureau accounts for 51 percent, and the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant accounts for 29 percent.

However, judging from the overall situation of handling stagnant materials, the materials already handled in the province account for only 7 percent of the total amount of stagnant materials; some units, such as the Provincial Department of Industry, the Provincial Engineering Bureau, the Department of Agriculture, and the Taiyuan Paper Mill, have not yet started processing. To this end, the Shanxi Provincial Finance and Economics Committee issued a circular, requesting leading cadres of all units to pay attention to and personally lead this work, and actively handle the stagnant materials that have not yet been processed.

    山西各企业单位有计划地处理呆滞物资
    山西省各企业单位从六月份开始进行处理呆滞物资的工作，有的单位已作出一些成绩。
    山西省财政经济委员会曾于六月中旬召集国营及地方国营企业等三十五个单位开会，研究处理各企业单位的呆滞物资。会上了解全省各企业单位积压的物资共值二千八百余亿元。积压的物资，有各种机械、工具、大小五金、水泥、铁路专用器材、邮电专用器材、电器设备、机油、土木建筑材料、汽车零件、铅丝、玻璃等，种类甚多。这些物资，绝大部分是可以使用的，有一部分加工修配后即能使用，有极少部分因积压过久，不能使用，需要报废。有些单位积压的物资，正是其他单位迫切需要的。如省电业局积压了一批水泥、臭胶，省工程局正需要水泥，太原重型机器厂正需要臭胶。对这类物资，随即进行了调剂。
    会上对处理呆滞物资的原则、价格等作了规定，并决定由太原、大同、阳泉市财政经济委员会分别组织呆滞物资处理所，除国家统一分配的物资外，一般物资都可以拿到呆滞物资处理所进行交易。另外决定组织各企业单位互相参观仓库，进行调剂调拨。
    三个月来，许多企业单位已积极行动起来，处理呆滞物资。太原、大同、阳泉三市都组织了呆滞物资处理所，不少厂矿组织参观了仓库。到目前为止，全省已处理的呆滞物资约值二百零七亿元。省水利局处理的物资占呆滞物资总额的百分之六十三，省交通局处理的占百分之五十一，太原重型机器厂处理的占百分之二十九。
    但就整个处理呆滞物资工作的情况看来，全省已处理的物资，不过占呆滞物资总额的百分之七；有些单位如省工业厅、省工程局、农业厅、太原造纸厂等，尚未开始处理。为此，山西省财政经济委员会发出通报，要求各单位领导干部重视并亲自领导这一工作，积极处理尚未处理的呆滞物资。
