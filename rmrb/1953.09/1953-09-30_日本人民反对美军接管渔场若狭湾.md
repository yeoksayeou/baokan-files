Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 29th: The conspiracy of the US-Japanese reactionaries to turn Wakasa Bay, a Japanese fishing ground, into a huge US military base is arousing strong opposition from the Japanese people.

Wakasa Bay is located on the west coast of central Japan and is one of Japan's best fishing grounds. The bay produces 4 million kan (one kan equals 7.5 market pounds) of fish annually, worth 1.6 billion yen, on which 5,400 fishing households along the coast depend for their livelihood. Disregarding the lives of Japanese fishermen, the Yoshida traitorous government announced in August that the coastal waters of Wakasa Bay would be designated as a US military exercise area. Recently, the "US-Japan Joint Committee" has been preparing to take over Wakasa Bay and plans to establish a large integrated military base there, mainly for air force exercises. The area they plan to take over is very large, stretching from Cape Kyoga of Yosa Peninsula in Kyoto Prefecture in the west to Echizen Cape of Nyuu District in Fukui Prefecture in the east, crossing many coastal cities such as Maizuru, Higashi-Maizuru, Obama, and Tsuruga. According to the US military's plan, in addition to designating the sea area within 20 nautical miles from the coast as an exercise area, many seaplane bases, radar bases, anti-aircraft gun positions, submarine bases, and gun emplacements will be established. Obama will be expanded into a military port, and the island of Kanmuri in the bay will become a naval gun bombardment target. The entire Wakasa Bay area will become a jet aircraft exercise area.

If this plan of the US-Japanese reactionaries is implemented, the 5,400 fishing households along the coast of Wakasa Bay will be unable to live because they cannot fish. At the same time, the port of Maizuru will lose its value as a link between the fishing grounds and the three major consumer cities of Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe, and the fisheries and people's lives in these cities will also be greatly affected. Therefore, the people along the coast of Wakasa Bay and in the above-mentioned areas have launched an opposition movement to protect their fisheries and livelihoods. Fishermen in Fukui Prefecture have been fighting continuously since August. The Fukui Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and the Wakasa District Committee have strongly supported the struggle of the local fishermen from the beginning. On September 3rd, representatives from many groups, including the Wakasa District Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, the Wakasa District Council of Trade Unions, the Nishizu Youth League, and the Wakasa Cultural Council, held a meeting and established an opposition action committee to promote the movement against the US military's takeover of Wakasa Bay. The Fisheries Association Federation, consisting of 80 fisheries cooperatives, is also beginning to launch an opposition movement.

People from all walks of life in Maizuru City have also launched an opposition movement. On August 28th, the Maizuru City Council held an emergency meeting and resolved to oppose the US military's takeover of Wakasa Bay. On September 3rd, representatives from many groups, including local trade union organizations, youth leagues, and agricultural cooperatives in Maizuru City, as well as representatives from the city council and the municipal government, also held a meeting of the action committee against the takeover of Wakasa Bay. The meeting decided to convene a general assembly of citizens, unite with the people of Fukui Prefecture to carry out the struggle, and call on the people of Japan to launch a nationwide opposition movement.

    日本人民反对美军接管渔场若狭湾
    【新华社二十九日讯】东京消息：美日反动派企图把日本的渔场若狭湾变为美国巨大军事基地的阴谋，正引起日本人民的强烈反对。
    若狭湾位于日本中部西海岸。是日本最好的渔场之一。湾内每年产鱼四百万贯（每贯合七点五市斤），合价十六亿日元，沿岸有五千四百户渔民赖以为生。吉田卖国政府不顾日本渔民的死活，已在八月间宣布将若狭湾沿岸海面划为美军的演习场。最近，“美日联合委员会”已在准备接管若狭湾，并计划在那里建立一个以空军演习场为主的庞大的综合性军事基地。他们计划接管的区域很大，将西起京都府与谢半岛的经岬，东到福井县丹生郡的越前岬，横跨舞鹤、东舞鹤、小浜、敦贺等许多沿海大城市。根据美军计划，除了把距海岸二十海里以内的一带海面划为演习场外，并将设立许多水上机场、雷达基地、高射炮阵地、潜水艇基地以及炮台等。小浜将扩大为军港，湾内的冠岛将变成舰炮轰击目标，整个若狭湾全境将变成喷气式飞机的演习场。
    如果美日反动派的这个计划一旦付诸实施，若狭湾沿岸的五千四百户渔民，即将由于不能捕鱼而无法生活。同时，舞鹤渔港也将失去联结各渔场和京都、大阪、神户三大消费城市的价值，这些城市的渔业和人民生活，也将受到很大影响。因此，若狭湾沿岸和上述地区的人民，为了保卫渔业经营和生计，已展开反对运动。福井县的渔民自八月起就不断地进行了斗争。日本共产党福井县委会和若狭地区委员会自始就以大力支持了当地渔民的斗争。九月三日，日本共产党若狭地区委员会、若狭地区工会评议会、西津青年团、若狭文化协议会等许多团体代表举行会议，成立了反对行动委员会，来推动反对美军接管若狭湾的运动。由八十个渔业合作社组成的渔业公会联合会也正在开始发动反对运动。
    舞鹤市的各阶层人民也发动了反对运动。八月二十八日，舞鹤市议会曾召开紧急会议，决议反对美军接管若狭湾。九月三日，舞鹤市地方工会组织、青年团、农业合作社等许多团体的代表及市议会、市政当局的代表，也召开了反对接管若狭湾行动委员会的会议。会上决定召开全体市民大会，和福井县人民联合起来进行斗争，并号召日本各地人民，展开全国性的反对运动。
