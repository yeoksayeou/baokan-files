The Ministry of Agriculture notified various regions to do a good job in wheat seed treatment.

In early July, Wenxian County and Nanyang City in Henan Province, and other places, discovered that wheat seeds that had suffered frost damage either did not germinate or had low germination rates. Therefore, agricultural agencies in some frost-affected areas organized farms and farmers to conduct experiments. It has now been proven that frost damage has little effect on wheat seeds, and the general germination rate is above 90 percent. The Central Ministry of Agriculture has recently notified various regions of the above experimental results and requested that various regions do the following tasks before sowing:

　　(1) This year, many areas have had a lot of rain, and the moisture content of wheat after entering the warehouse is high, and the after-ripening process is slow. Therefore, it is necessary to publicize to the masses the implementation of sun-drying of seeds to avoid mold and insects in the wheat seeds and reduce the germination rate. Before sowing, persuade the masses to use wind selection and screening to remove shriveled, damaged, diseased, and insect-infested grains to ensure the quality of the wheat seeds and improve the germination rate.

　　(2) Call on the masses to conduct germination tests before autumn sowing. If the germination rate is too low, it should not be used as seed. If the germination rate is slightly low but can still be used as seed, the amount of sowing should be increased proportionally.

　　(3) In areas where wheat diseases and insect pests are serious, preparations should be made as early as possible to organize the masses to soak and mix seeds. For example, to prevent loose smut, the method of combining seed soaking with manure and seed isolation should be used. To prevent stem nematode disease, mud water or salt water can be used to select seeds. To prevent underground pests, the method of mixing arsenic-poisoned grain with seeds can be used.

### 中央农业部通知各地做好麦种处理工作

    中央农业部通知各地做好麦种处理工作
    七月初，河南温县、南阳等地曾发现遭受霜灾后的麦种有不发芽或发芽率低的情况。因此，一些遭受霜灾地区的农业机关，曾组织农场及农民群众进行试验，现已证明霜害对麦种影响不大，一般发芽率都在百分之九十以上。中央农业部近已将上述试验结果通知各地，并要求各地在播种前做好下列各项工作：
    （一）今年不少地区雨水多，小麦入仓后水分大，后熟作用缓慢。因此必须向群众宣传，实行晒种，以免麦种发霉生虫，降低发芽率，并在播种前，说服群众风选筛选，去掉瘪粒、坏粒、病粒、虫粒，以保证麦种质量，提高麦种的发芽率。
    （二）号召群众，在秋播前，进行发芽试验，如发芽率太低，则不应作种，如发芽率略低，尚可作种的，则应按比例增加播种量。
    （三）在小麦病虫害严重的地区，要及早做好准备，组织群众浸种拌种。如防治黑穗病，应用浸种与粪种隔离相结合的办法。防治腺虫病可用泥水或盐水选种。防治地下害虫，可采用信石毒谷拌种的方法。
