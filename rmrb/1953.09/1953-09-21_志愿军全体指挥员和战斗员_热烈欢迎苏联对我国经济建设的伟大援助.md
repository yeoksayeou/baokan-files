The achievements of our country's construction and the happiness of my family are inseparable from the help given by the great Soviet Union. Now the Soviet Union is helping us build so many large factories and enterprises, so that our country can better gradually transition to socialism. I am truly excited and grateful."

We must be a hundred times more vigilant and be prepared to smash any aggressive conspiracy of the enemy!"

    热烈欢迎苏联对我国经济建设的伟大援助
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十日电】中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员热烈欢迎和感谢苏联对我国经济建设的伟大援助。九月十七日，中国人民志愿军各部队的报纸、新闻简讯和黑板报，都以显著地位刊登了毛主席给马林科夫主席的感谢电和中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会副主任李富春同志“关于与苏联政府商谈苏联对我国经济建设援助问题的报告”。指挥员战斗员们欢欣鼓舞地互相传告着这个重大消息。
    中国人民志愿军的指挥员、战斗员们对苏联政府和苏联人民的伟大援助一致表示感谢。守卫在东线鱼隐山阵地上的某部战士徐金英说：“苏联老大哥这种全面的、长期的帮助，使我国的工业化有了根基。中国工业化了，以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的力量也就更加强大了。这一消息使我更爱祖国，更爱苏联！”许多战士由此想起了正在日新月异中的故乡。某部班长刘士国说：“我家住在淮河边的安徽凤台县，从前年年闹水灾，十年九不收，但是在苏联专家帮助下开始根治淮河以后，再没有闹水灾，家乡人民的生活逐渐好起来了。我们祖国建设的成就，我们家庭的幸福，都与伟大的苏联给予的帮助分不开的。现在苏联又帮助我们建设这样多的大工厂大企业，使我们祖国能够更好地逐步过渡到社会主义。我真是又兴奋又感激。”
    苏联对我国经济建设的伟大援助更加鼓舞了中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员保卫祖国、保卫和平的战斗意志。某部战士吴帮友说：“在苏联的援助下，再过几年，我们祖国就会建设得更加美好了，我们保卫和平的力量也愈加强大了。我们的神圣职责就是使美国侵略者不敢再在朝鲜发动战争，保证祖国平平安安地进行建设。我们一定百倍地提高警惕，准备粉碎敌人的任何侵略阴谋！”
