    Drug Prices at Beijing Municipal Third Hospital Should Be Adjusted

    Zhou Zhen of the Beijing Company of the China National Food Export Corporation writes: The drug prices at Beijing Municipal Third Hospital are generally more than 20% higher than the listed prices of state-owned pharmaceutical companies, and some are even several times higher. For example, the price of streptomycin at pharmaceutical companies is 18,000 yuan per vial, but the hospital sells it for 32,000 yuan, which is more than 77% higher; the price of Remifen at pharmaceutical companies is 200 yuan per tablet, but the hospital sells it for 500 yuan per tablet, which is 150% higher; the price of aspirin at pharmaceutical companies is 40 yuan per tablet, but the hospital sells it for 300 yuan per tablet, which is 6.5 times higher. It is understood that some hospitals in other places also have similar situations with drug prices. This phenomenon is unreasonable. I believe that Beijing Municipal Third Hospital should quickly adjust its drug prices.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    北京市立第三医院药品售价应作调整
    中国食品出口公司北京市公司周镇来信：北京市立第三医院的药品售价，一般都超过国营医药公司牌价百分之二十以上，有的竟超过牌价数倍。如医药公司的链霉素价格是每支一万八千元，该院却卖三万二千元，贵了百分之七十七以上；医药公司的雷米丰价格是每片二百元，该院售价每片是五百元，贵了百分之一百五十；医药公司的阿斯匹灵每片卖四十元，该院每片售价三百元，竟贵了六倍半。据了解，其他地方某些医院的药品售价也有类似情形。这种现象是不合理的。我认为：北京市立第三医院应该迅速调整药品售价。
