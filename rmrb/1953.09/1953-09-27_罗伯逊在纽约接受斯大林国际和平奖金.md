Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 26th: According to TASS, a ceremony for awarding the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples" to Paul Robeson, outstanding American peace fighter and renowned progressive leader, was held on September 23rd in the music hall of the Theresa Hotel in New York. Attendees included writer Howard Fast, Charlotte Bass, the 1952 Progressive Party vice-presidential candidate, Baldwin, secretary of the National Committee of the American Progressive Party, Willard Uphaus, a member of the World Peace Council, William Foster, chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, Samuel Sillen, editor of the "Masses & Mainstream" magazine, writer Frederick Field, former Governor of Minnesota and Progressive Party leader Elmer Benson, artists Rockwell Kent and Charles White, as well as representatives from the New York Peace Committee and many workers, scientists, writers, actors, and artists.

    The award ceremony was presided over by Fast. Dr. William Du Bois read the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on the establishment of the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples." Du Bois said that Robeson could not go to Moscow to receive the prize because the US State Department refused to issue him a passport. He then gave a detailed account of Robeson's life and his struggle for peace and a better future for the American people.

    Amidst thunderous applause, Fast read congratulatory letters to Robeson from Soviet writers Fadeyev, Surkov, Simonov, Sholokhov, Ehrenburg, Tikhonov, and others, as well as letters from groups and public figures in China, Poland, France, Belgium, and the United States.

    Fast also read a congratulatory telegram from Academician Skobeltsyn, chairman of the Committee for the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples," who expressed the committee's respect for Robeson, conveyed the friendly congratulations of millions of Soviet people, and expressed confidence that the American people, like the people of other countries, do not want war and yearn for peace.

    Fast then delivered a speech, emphasizing the great significance of the international peace movement. He said that the struggle for peace is the greatest, most difficult, and most noble struggle ever undertaken by mankind, and the heroes in the struggle for peace are the noblest and bravest heroes mankind has ever had. This struggle is most difficult in the place where the threat of war is greatest. Robeson is one of America's greatest and bravest sons, linking the American people's powerful struggle for freedom with the struggle of all mankind for human liberation. He stands tall in a sea filled with hatred and hypocrisy, cruel terror and mad persecution, lies and deceit. It is very appropriate that he receives this beautiful and noble award today. Fast concluded by pointing out that Robeson's receipt of this award is an honor for millions of Americans.

    When Fast presented Robeson with the gold medal and certificate of the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples," the audience applauded enthusiastically.

    Robeson then delivered his acceptance speech. He said, "I have been, am, and always will be a steadfast and strong friend of the Soviet Union." He had just traveled throughout the Americas, speaking and singing to more than 80,000 Americans and Canadians, and millions of other Americans want peace. They feel uneasy because a small handful of people in power talk about peace but are clearly preparing for war. This open expression of dissatisfaction and deep concern comes from people in all walks of life in the United States.

    Robeson said that as Americans, when we see evildoers among us making false pious statements at domestic or international conferences, we should stop them. We should be inspired by the example of our many great leaders, both in and out of prison. We can be proud that we are honored to contribute our strength to this great struggle for lasting peace. Robeson then spoke of the reactionaries' obstruction of his singing to the people. He said, "When a person is attacked for his entire people, we can say that he is sacrificing for his entire people. Our sacrifices, like the sacrifices of the Rosenbergs, radiate brightly in the hopes of people of different cultures, races, and faiths in various countries. Our historical mission will not fail to be accomplished, and the awarding of this prize to the American peace fighter proves this point."

    At the end of the ceremony, everyone stood up, cheered for Robeson, and shouted, "Long live the eternal friendship between the Soviet and American peoples! Glory to our friend Paul Robeson! Long live world peace!"

    罗伯逊在纽约接受斯大林国际和平奖金
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：以“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金授予美国杰出的和平战士和著名进步领袖保罗·罗伯逊的仪式，九月二十三日在纽约黛丽莎大饭店的音乐厅里举行。参加仪式的有作家霍华德·法斯特，一九五二年进步党副总统候选人夏洛特·巴斯，美国进步党全国委员会书记鲍德温、世界和平理事会理事威拉德·厄普豪斯，美国共产党全国委员会主席威廉·福斯特，“群众与主流”杂志编者塞缪尔·西伦，作家弗雷德里克·费尔德，前明尼苏达州州长、进步党领袖埃默·本逊，艺术家罗克威尔·肯特和查尔斯·怀特以及纽约和平委员会代表和许多工人、科学家、作家、演员和艺术工作者。
    授奖仪式由法斯特主持。威廉·杜波依斯博士宣读了苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于设立“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的决议。杜波依斯说：罗伯逊不能到莫斯科去接受奖金，因为美国国务院拒绝发护照给他。他接着详细地叙述了罗伯逊的生平和罗伯逊为争取和平与美国人民更美好的将来而斗争的事迹。
    法斯特在暴风雨般的欢呼声中宣读了苏联作家法捷耶夫、苏尔科夫、西蒙诺夫、萧洛霍夫、爱伦堡、吉洪诺夫等人致罗伯逊的贺信，并宣读了中国、波兰、法国、比利时等许多国家和美国的团体和公众领袖的贺信。
    法斯特又宣读了“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会主席、苏联科学院院士斯科贝尔琴的贺电，斯科贝尔琴在电文中表示了委员会对罗伯逊的敬意，转达了千百万苏联人民的友好祝贺，并表示确信美国人民和其他国家人民一样，是不要战争，热望和平的。
    法斯特接着发表演说，他着重指出国际和平运动的巨大意义。他说：争取和平的斗争是人类所曾进行过的最巨大的、最困难的和最崇高的斗争，争取和平的斗争中的英雄，是人类所曾有过的最崇高和最勇敢的英雄。在那个战争威胁最大的地方，这种斗争最困难。罗伯逊是美国的最伟大和最勇敢的儿子之一，罗伯逊把美国人民争取自由的强大斗争和全人类争取人类自由的斗争联结起来。他屹立在充满着憎恨与伪善、残酷的恐怖与疯狂的迫害、谎话和欺骗的海洋中。今天他得到这个美丽、崇高的奖金是非常适当的。法斯特最后指出，罗伯逊得到这奖金是千百万美国人的光荣。
    当法斯特把“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的金质奖章和奖状授予罗伯逊的时候，全场热烈鼓掌。
    接着由罗伯逊致答词。他说：我过去、现在和将来永远是苏联的一个坚定的和坚强的朋友。我刚在美洲大陆各地作过旅行，我对八万多美国人和加拿大人讲过话，唱过歌，还有成千成万的其他美国人要和平。他们感到不安，因为一小撮当政者嘴里谈着和平，实际上显然在准备战争。这种公开的不满表示和深切关怀，来自美国各阶层的人民。
    罗伯逊说：作为美国人，在看到我们中间的干坏事的人在国内的或国际的会议上发表假作虔诚的言论的时候，应该制止他们。我们应该受到在狱中和不在狱中的我们许多伟大领袖的榜样的鼓舞。我们可以引为骄傲的，是我们能够荣幸地在这个争取持久和平的伟大斗争中贡献我们的力量。罗伯逊接着谈到反动派阻挠他向人民演唱的情形。他说：当一个人为了他的全体人民而受到打击的时候，我们就能说他在为他的全体人民牺牲。我们的牺牲，正如罗森堡夫妇的牺牲一样，在文化不同、种族不同、信仰不同的各国人民的希望的照耀下，放射出万丈光芒。我们的历史任务是不会不完成的，授予美国和平战士这一奖励证明了这一点。
    仪式完毕时，全体起立，为罗伯逊欢呼，并高呼“苏联与美国人民的永恒友谊万岁！光荣归于我们的朋友保罗·罗伯逊！世界和平万岁！”
