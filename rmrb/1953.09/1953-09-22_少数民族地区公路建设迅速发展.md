    Rapid Development of Highway Construction in Minority Areas
    [This newspaper dispatch] The highway transportation construction in minority areas across the country is developing rapidly. Of the more than 5,000 kilometers of highways built this year, 57% were built in minority areas. Among them are the famous Kangzang Highway, Qingzang Highway, Cheng'a Highway, and Lanlang Highway. The construction of these highways is of great significance for the development of the political, economic, and cultural life of minority areas.
    All these highway construction projects were carried out in extremely difficult environments. However, thanks to the efforts of all workers, military personnel, and the active participation and support of the people in minority areas, most of the tasks were completed according to plan. This year, the focus of the Qingzang Highway construction is the Chala Ping section from Huangheyan to Bayan Har Mountain. This section has to pass through several areas of loose sandy soil and dozens of miles of swamps and marshy land (a loose mixture of corroded organic matter and soil covering the ground to a depth of one to two meters), and bridges have to be erected over the Yellow River and the Dahei River. Most of the sections along the line are located on plateaus with an altitude of 4,500 meters to 4,900 meters above sea level, where the air is thin and the temperature changes unpredictably. In the morning, the sun can make people faint, and at night, the water in the washbasin freezes into ice. But all these difficulties were overcome by the road-building heroes. The workers who built the marshy sections figured out how to dig away the thawed peat layer by layer, and if it was not thawed, they used explosives to blast it, and then transported dry soil from one kilometer away to pad it. Workers in the loose sandy soil areas transported stones from far away to pave the road surface. The Tibetan people knew that this highway was being built for them, and they also automatically collected yak dung as fuel for the road-building workers. They also organized a transportation team of 2,000 yaks to support the construction of the Qingzang Highway. When the Tibetan people saw the workers building the wooden pontoon bridge over the Yellow River in the severe cold of minus 40 degrees, they carried fresh milk and ghee from their tents 20 miles away every morning to feed the workers. After everyone came up with ideas, the labor efficiency of each section has been significantly improved. At the beginning, each worker could only dig one cubic meter of earth, but now it has generally increased to four cubic meters. Xu Chuntian and Sun Deshui dug 22.6 cubic meters in one day. There are no inhabitants for hundreds of miles along the Kangzang Highway, and the climate here is a quarter later than in the inland areas. The workers who built the highway slept for many years on the damp ground or snow covered with branches and stones. There is no water in the high mountains, so they melt snow to cook. When food was scarce, they ate thin porridge, tsampa paste, and wild vegetables, and continued to persevere in their work. When they encountered cliffs where there was no place to set foot, they erected scaffolding or used ropes to hold their waists, suspended in mid-air, and still drilled holes and exploded. Tibetan officials also came to the construction site to help solve various difficulties in the work. Many Tibetan people who participated in the road construction had never used shovels or steel picks before, but they quickly learned road construction techniques. One pastoral group created a new record of digging five cubic meters of earth per person per day. With the rapid progress of road construction and the widespread development of patriotic unity competition, many model figures have emerged among the Tibetan migrant workers. In July alone, a certain section selected five model groups and nine model migrant workers, and five headmen were also rewarded for their active work. When Qinghai renovated the Tongxun (Tongren County to Xunhua County) highway, 500 Tibetan migrant workers, under the leadership of Zhaxi, Vice Chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Tongren County, launched a red flag competition, which powerfully promoted the progress of the project.
    The development of highway transportation in minority areas is of great significance for the development of political, economic, and cultural relations in minority areas. For example, before liberation, ethnic minorities such as Tibetans, Miao, Zhuang, Hui, and Yi in Xikang could not get salt or clothes; after the Kangzang Highway was opened to traffic, wool, leather goods, and medicinal materials produced in Xikang were continuously transported out along the highway, and at the same time, a large number of salt, cloth, department stores, and other goods were transported in from the highway. In the past, one dou of rice could not be exchanged for one jin of salt, but now you can buy one jin of salt for 2,500 yuan everywhere. Today, primary schools have been established in all major cities and towns in Xikang, and a ethnic college has also been opened in Kangding. The same is true for minority areas in Sichuan. Before the Wenchuanchuan County to Lixian County section of the Cheng'a Highway was opened to traffic on March 15 this year, more than 20 shops were added to Xuecheng Town. The average turnover of shops in the town in early March increased by 58.63% compared with the same period in January, and the prices of major commodities decreased day by day. In order to welcome the new prosperity after the opening of traffic, a market four times larger than the original was added to the town. At the same time, the National Bank and state-owned commercial departments also united private merchants to organize sales groups to go deep into the mountain villages to supply ethnic minorities with daily necessities and purchase local specialties. After the opening of traffic, various construction tasks in Xuecheng Town will also be carried out more quickly. A hydroelectric power station and a school that can accommodate 1,000 students will be built this year.

    少数民族地区公路建设迅速发展
    【本报讯】全国少数民族地区的公路交通建设事业正在迅速发展。今年全国修建的五千多公里公路中，有百分之五十七是在少数民族地区修建的。其中有著名的康藏公路、青藏公路、成阿公路、兰郎公路等。这些公路的修建，对于发展少数民族地区的政治、经济和文化生活有很大的意义。
    所有这些公路的建设工程都是在极端艰苦的环境下进行的，但是由于全体职工、军工的努力和少数民族地区人民的积极参加和支持，大都按计划完成了任务。青藏路今年施工的重点是从黄河沿到巴颜喀喇山的查拉坪一段。这一段要经过几处绵沙地带和数十里的沼泽地、沮洳地（一种覆盖在地面一至二公尺左右深的稀松的腐蚀有机质与土壤的混合物），还要在黄河和大黑河上架设桥梁。沿线大部分地段都在拔海四千五百公尺到四千九百公尺的高原上，空气稀薄，气温变化无常，上午太阳能把人晒得晕倒，晚上漱口缸里的水就冻成冰了。但所有这些困难都被筑路的英雄们克服了。修建沮洳地段的工人，想办法将解冻了的泥炭层一层一层地挖去，没有解冻的就用炸药炸，然后再从一公里外运来干土垫上。在绵沙地段的工人从很远的地方运石头来铺砌路面。藏民们知道这条公路是为他们修建的，也自动为筑路的工人收集牦牛粪作燃料用，他们还组织了一支包括二千头牦牛的运输队，支援修建青藏公路。当藏民看到工人们在零下四十度的严寒中修筑黄河木便桥时，他们每天早上从二十里外的帐房里，把新鲜的牛奶和酥油背来送给工人们吃。经过大家想办法，各工段的劳动效率已显著提高，刚开始每工只能挖一方土，现在普遍已增到四方。像徐春田、孙德水两人一天就挖了二十二点六方。康藏公路沿线几百里都没人烟，这里的气候，要比内地晚一个季度。修筑公路的工人就长年睡在垫上树枝和石头的湿地上或雪地上。高山上没有水，他们就化雪水煮饭。粮食困难的时候，他们吃稀饭，吃?粑糊糊，吃野菜，继续坚持工作。碰到悬崖绝壁上没有下脚的地方，他们就搭起架子或者用绳子拦住腰，悬在半空中，照样打眼爆炸。藏族的官员们也到工地上来帮助解决工作中的各种困难问题。参加修路工作的许多藏民，他们过去从未使用过铁锹、钢镐，但很快就学会了筑路技术。有一个牧民小组创造了每日每人挑土五公方的新纪录。随着筑路的迅速进展和爱国团结竞赛运动的普遍展开，藏族民工中出现了许多模范人物。仅某工段七月份即评选出五个模范小组和九个模范民工，五个头人也因工作积极而受到奖励。青海整修同循（同仁县到循化县）公路时，有五百藏族民工，在同仁县藏族自治区人民政府副主席扎喜的领导下，展开红旗竞赛，有力地推动了工程的进展。
    少数民族地区公路交通事业的发展，对发展少数民族地区的政治经济文化关系很大。例如西康的藏族、苗族、僮族、回族、彝族等少数民族，解放前吃不到盐，穿不上衣服；康藏公路通车后，西康出产的羊毛、皮货、药材都源源地沿着公路运了出来，同时又从公路运进大批的盐、布、百货等物品，过去一斗米换一斤盐都换不到手，现在只要用二千五百元到处可以买到一斤盐。如今西康各主要城市镇都设立了小学，康定还开办了一所民族学院。四川的少数民族地区也是如此，成阿公路汶川县到理县段今年三月十五日通车前夕，薛城镇上就增添了二十多家商店。全镇商铺营业额三月初平均比一月同一时期增加百分之五十八点六三，各主要商品的价格逐日下降。为了迎接通车后新的繁荣，镇上新添了一个比原来扩大了四倍的市场。同时，国家银行和国营商业部门也团结私商组织推销组深入山寨，供应各少数民族生活日用品，并收购土特产。薛城镇在通车后，各项建设工作也将更加迅速开展起来，水力发电站和容纳一千学生的学校都将在今年开始修建。
