Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The Central People's Government's Ministry of Grain issued a circular on the 8th, instructing national major regions and provincial/municipal state grain organizations to rapidly resolve the current problems existing in grain procurement. The circular stated: Currently, in some areas, due to limited storage capacity, grain from grassroots purchasing stations has not been transferred in a timely manner; staffing is insufficient; organizational setup cannot meet the demands of the masses; fund allocation is not prompt, significantly affecting large-scale grain procurement. The Fenghuang Purchasing Station in Nanchang County, Jiangxi, due to insufficient storage capacity, has been placing rice directly on the ground. In areas like Shucheng, Feixi, and Lu'an in the Lu'an Special District of Anhui, and Nanling County in the Wuhu Special District, the failure to transport grain from grassroots purchasing stations in a timely manner has affected the continued large-scale purchase or forced suspension of purchases. The establishment of grain purchasing stations and staffing in Henan Province are far from meeting the needs of farmers selling grain after the autumn harvest, causing farmer dissatisfaction. Some areas have experienced delayed fund allocation for grain purchases, leading to failures to purchase. The circular pointed out: Grain departments in all regions must recognize that vigorously purchasing grain and meeting the needs of farmers to sell grain is the primary task at present. Grain entering the market has a certain seasonality, and it is necessary to seize the time to organize all forces to solve the various problems that exist currently. The circular emphasized: Attention to purchasing work should not be limited to conference arrangements and written instructions, but personnel should be sent for in-depth inspection to promptly discover and effectively solve existing problems. Currently, all regions must:

    First, in grain purchasing, transport grain as it is collected, promptly transferring the grain from grassroots purchasing stations, especially grain from grassroots cooperatives, to transportation hubs, ensuring continued purchasing by all grassroots purchasing stations. If transportation is difficult, local governments should be consulted in a timely manner to assist in renting and repairing ancestral halls, temples, civilian housing, or constructing simple temporary sheds that can shelter from wind and rain.
    Second, concentrate forces to allocate all available personnel to grassroots purchasing stations for purchasing. In areas with too few institutions, purchasing stations should be added. If there are insufficient personnel, local governments can be relied upon to hire temporary staff.
    Third, allocate funds in a timely manner to ensure no failures to purchase. Grain departments above the county level should closely contact local People's Banks, and be prepared at all times. The allocation period for grassroots purchasing stations far away should be appropriately extended. If there are difficulties, local financial committees can be requested to temporarily borrow funds and pay interest.
    Fourth, in areas where there are insufficient personnel at certain purchasing stations or too few purchasing stations, private grain merchants can be organized to purchase on behalf of the state, provided that effective leadership can be ensured.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Since September, the middle-season rice in the south has begun to enter the market in large quantities, and the wheat purchase in the north is nearing its end. Autumn crops such as sorghum, corn, millet, beans, and other miscellaneous grains are successively pouring into the market. Middle-season rice and miscellaneous grains account for a very large proportion of China's total grain output. Currently, the market in grain producing areas nationwide presents a busy scene of farmers selling grain, and state-owned grain departments and cooperatives have actively launched purchasing work.

    In Sichuan, Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other provinces where middle-season rice is entering the market in large quantities, the daily purchase volume in late August was over 10 million jin. In August, the East China region completed 123.83% of its rice purchase plan; the Southwest region completed 164.49%. However, the Central South region, which accounts for the largest rice production in the country, only completed 81.68% of its monthly plan. The main reason why the national rice purchase plan was not completed on schedule in August was that farmers in the south were reluctant to sell due to drought. After entering September, the drought in the south was relieved, and the season for middle-season rice entering the market in large quantities has arrived. After relatively full preparation, grain departments in various regions are vigorously purchasing. In August, the national miscellaneous grain purchase plan was completed at 171.77%. In the past half month, the market volume of autumn grain has shown an upward trend.

    In order to do a good job in grain purchasing, the financial and economic leading departments in various regions are strengthening leadership over purchasing work and the supply of materials to farmers.

    中央粮食部向各地粮食部门发出通报
    集中最大力量收购秋粮
    购粮工作在全国粮产区市场上普遍展开
    【新华社十七日讯】中央人民政府粮食部于八日发出通报，要全国各大区和省、市国家粮食机构，迅速解决当前收购粮食中存在的问题。通报说：目前，一部分地区因仓容有限，基层收购点的粮食没有及时调走；人员配备不够；组织设置不能满足群众要求；资金调拨不及时；相当影响了大力收购粮食。江西南昌县凤阳收购站因仓容不够，已将稻谷倒置在地上。安徽六安专区舒城、肥西、六安和芜湖专区的南陵县等地因基层购粮站的粮食未及时调运，影响继续大量购进或被迫停收。河南省购粮站的设置和人员配备远不能满足秋粮成熟后农民售粮的要求，引起农民不满。有些地区曾有购粮资金调拨不及时发生脱购现象。通报指出：各地粮食部门必须认识大力收购粮食，满足农民售粮要求是当前的首要任务。粮食上市有一定季节性，必须抓紧时间组织一切力量解决当前存在的各种问题。通报着重指出：重视收购工作不能只限于会议布置、文电指示，要派人深入检查，及时发现和切实解决现存的问题。目前各地必须：
    一，购粮中随收随运，及时把基层购粮点的粮食特别是基层合作社的粮食调运到交通点线，保证各基层购粮点继续收购。如调运困难，应及时商请当地政府协助，租修祠堂、庙宇、民房，或搭盖简单可避风雨的临时仓棚。
    二，集中力量把可以抽调的人员都配备到基层购粮点去收购。机构过少的地方应增设收购站，如人员不足时可依靠当地政府雇用临时人员。
    三，及时调拨资金，保证不脱购。县以上粮食部门应密切和当地人民银行联系，随时准备。对路途较远的基层收购点调拨期限酌予放宽。如有困难可请示当地财委暂借，并付予利息。
    四，在某些购粮点人员不足或购粮点过少的地方，在能够切实领导的条件下，可组织私营粮商为国家代购。
    据新华社讯：九月份以来，南方中稻开始大量上市，北方小麦收购已是尾声，秋季作物高粱、玉米、谷子、豆类等杂粮相继涌入市场。中稻和杂粮在我国粮食总产量中占有极大比重。目前，全国粮产区市场上，呈现着农民售粮的繁忙景象，国营粮食部门和合作社已积极展开收购工作。
    中稻大量上市的四川、广东、湖北、江西、浙江、江苏等省，八月下旬每日收购量在一千万斤以上。八月份华东区完成大米收购计划百分之一百二十三点八三；西南区完成了百分之一百六十四点四九。但大米产量占全国第一位的中南区只完成月计划百分之八十一点六八。八月份全国大米收购计划没有按期完成，其主要原因之一是因南方天旱，农民有惜售思想。进入九月后，南方旱象解除，中稻大量上市的季节已经到来。各地粮食部门经过较充分的准备后，大力收购。八月份全国杂粮收购计划完成了百分之一百七十一点七七。近半个月来，秋粮上市量呈现出上升的趋势。
    为了做好购粮工作，各地财经领导部门正在加强对收购工作的领导和对农民的物资供应工作。
