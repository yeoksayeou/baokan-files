    The Central Grain Ministry is Studying Revisions to Pricing Methods for Grain Transfers
    Letter from the Central People's Government Grain Ministry: After reading the criticism by comrades Liu Xun and two others from the Henan Provincial Grain Bureau published in the People's Daily on August 13 regarding the inconsistent handling of grain transfer pricing issues, we immediately conducted an inspection of this work. We believe that the criticisms made by comrades Liu Xun et al. are correct. Recently, due to changes in circumstances, the original grain transfer pricing methods are no longer applicable and should be revised; however, this issue involves a wide range of factors, and therefore it has not been handled promptly. Under these circumstances, when dealing with disputes between the parties involved in the transfer regarding pricing issues, we often favored the grain-issuing party and were not firm enough in implementing the original grain transfer pricing methods. We are now actively studying revisions to the grain transfer pricing methods, which will be issued soon; before the new methods are issued, we will resolutely implement the original regulations to reduce disputes.

    中央粮食部正在研究修订调拨粮食时的作价办法
    中央人民政府粮食部来信：读了八月十三日人民日报登载的河南省粮食厅刘勋等三同志对我们处理粮食调拨作价问题不统一的批评后，我们当即对这个工作进行检查。我们认为刘勋等同志提出的批评是对的。最近因为情况有变化，原来的粮食调拨作价办法已有不适用之处，应该加以修订；但是这个问题牵涉很广，因此未能及时办理。在这种情况下，我们处理交接双方对作价问题的争执时，往往偏重于照顾发粮方面，而对原有调拨作价办法的贯彻执行不够坚决。我们现在正积极研究修改调拨作价办法，不久即可下达；在新办法未下达前，当坚决按原规定执行，以减少纠纷。
