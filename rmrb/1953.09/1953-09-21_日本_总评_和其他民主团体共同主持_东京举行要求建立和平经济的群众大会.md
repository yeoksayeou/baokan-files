Xinhua News Agency, September 19th Dispatch from Tokyo: Under the joint auspices of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (abbreviated as "Sohyo") and other Japanese democratic groups, a mass rally opposing the U.S. Mutual Security Agency "Aid" and defending industry was held in Tokyo on the 17th. Leaders of "Sohyo" and guests attending the meeting delivered speeches, calling on the Japanese people to smash the Yoshida government's conspiracy to accept "aid" from the U.S. Mutual Security Agency to carry out large-scale rearmament, and advocating the establishment of a peaceful economy.

    The conference issued a peace declaration, demanding the establishment of Japan's peaceful economy on the basis of free trade. The declaration opposed the so-called "enterprise rationalization" of dismissing workers and intensifying labor being carried out by Japanese monopoly capitalists, and protested against U.S. "aid" and the rearmament of Japan.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 12th Dispatch from Tokyo: The struggle of the people of Yamagata Prefecture against the Yoshida government's establishment of a firing range by the "National Security Force" in Otakane Village has been won. The Yoshida government had long attempted to seize this village located in eastern Yamagata Prefecture to use as a firing range, and to provide it for use by the U.S. military at the same time in accordance with the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement." The local people launched a strong resistance struggle against the plans of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. Kyodo News acknowledged: "The National Security Force was forced by the angry villagers of Otakane Village in eastern Yamagata Prefecture on the 4th to give up its plan to use the firing range in the village."

    At the same time, the movement against the U.S. military's establishment of a training ground in Wakasa Bay, Fukui Prefecture, is developing. Influenced by the strong opposition of fishermen in Fukui Prefecture to military bases, and in order to safeguard their own interests, the chairmen of fisheries associations in various parts of Kyoto held a meeting on the afternoon of the 1st to discuss the issue of the U.S. military establishing a training ground in Wakasa Bay. The chairmen of the thirty-three fisheries associations attending the meeting unanimously passed a resolution and petition opposing the U.S. military's establishment of a maritime training ground in Wakasa Bay.

    东京举行要求建立和平经济的群众大会
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：在日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）和其他日本民主团体的主持下，十七日在东京举行了一个反对美国共同安全署“援助”、保卫产业的群众大会。“总评”的领袖和参加大会的来宾在会上发表了演说，号召日本人民粉碎吉田政府接受美国共同安全署的“援助”来进行大规模重新武装的阴谋，并主张建立和平经济。
    大会发表了和平宣言，要求在自由贸易的基础上建立日本的和平经济。宣言反对日本垄断资本家所正在进行的解雇工人和加强劳动强度的所谓“企业合理化”，并抗议美国的“援助”和重新武装日本。
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：山形县人民反对吉田政府“保安队”在大高根村设立打靶场的斗争已获得胜利。吉田政府早就企图霸占这个位于山形县东部的村子做打靶场，并按照美日“行政协定”同时供美军使用。当地人民对美、日反动派的计划展开了强烈的反抗斗争。共同社承认：“国家保安队四日被山形县东部大高根村的愤怒的村民们所迫，不得已放弃了使用该村中的打靶场的计划。”
    同时，反对美军在福井县若狭湾设立演习场的运动正在发展。京都各地渔业公会会长在福井县渔民强烈反对军事基地斗争的影响下，并且为了维护自身的利益，于一日下午举行会议，讨论美军在若狭湾设立演习场的问题。出席会议的三十三个渔业公会的会长一致通过了反对美军在若狭湾设置海上演习场的决议和请愿书。
