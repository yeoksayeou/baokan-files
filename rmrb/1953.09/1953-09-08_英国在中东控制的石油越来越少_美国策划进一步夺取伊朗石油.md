(Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch) Since the complete cessation of oil production by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Iran in August 1951, the balance of power between the United States and Britain in controlling Middle Eastern oil production has undergone significant changes over the past two years due to the intensified efforts of the United States to squeeze out Britain.

The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was Britain's only oil company in Iran, and it was originally the main pillar of Britain's "oil empire" in the Middle East. In 1945, Iran's oil production accounted for about two-thirds of the total oil production in the Middle East. In 1950, it still ranked first in Middle Eastern oil production, accounting for more than one-third of the total. With the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company as its core, Britain controlled 52.9 percent of oil production in the entire Middle East region. Therefore, the cessation of production by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company immediately put Britain at a disadvantage in the oil competition between the United States and Britain in the Middle East. In 1952, the percentage of oil production controlled by Britain in the Middle East plummeted to 33 percent.

As everyone knows, the United States has been intensifying its intrusion into the Middle East since the war and vying with Britain for control of oil. The oil production controlled by the United States in the Middle East quickly increased from 31 percent in 1946 to 44.4 percent in 1950. After the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company ceased production, the United States took the opportunity to vigorously expand the production of oil companies under its control and seize British markets. For example, the crude oil production of "Aramco" (in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia), the largest US oil company in the Middle East, increased by nearly 60 percent in 1952 compared to 1950. The crude oil production of other Middle Eastern oil companies with US capital participation, such as the Kuwait Oil Company, also increased rapidly. As a result, by 1952, the portion controlled by the United States in the total Middle Eastern crude oil production had increased to 59 percent, overwhelming Britain, which had controlled oil production in the Middle East for decades.

At the same time, the same changes took place in the refining industry in the Middle East. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's refinery in Abadan, southern Iran, was the largest refinery in the world. In 1950, it refined 458,000 barrels of oil per day. After the Abadan refinery closed, the remaining largest refineries in the Middle East were Aramco's refinery in Ras Tanura and the Bahrain Petroleum Company's refinery on Bahrain Island. Both of these are US refineries, with a total refining capacity of 200,000 barrels per day. As a result, the United States also squeezed out Britain's original dominant position in refining and controlled the Middle Eastern refining industry. In 1952, the United States controlled more than two-thirds of the total Middle Eastern refining capacity.

Due to the cessation of production by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Britain has not only been squeezed out of many oil markets by the United States in the past two years, but has also been forced to pay urgently needed foreign exchange to purchase oil from the United States. At the beginning of the cessation of production by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951, the then British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gaitskell, admitted that the cessation of production by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was estimated to cost Britain $350 million in foreign exchange annually. In the three months from July to September 1952 alone, Britain was forced to purchase $130 million worth of oil from the United States.

But the United States is not satisfied with this and is actively planning to further invade Iran and replace the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's position in Iran.

### 英国在中东控制的石油越来越少  美国策划进一步夺取伊朗石油

    英国在中东控制的石油越来越少
    美国策划进一步夺取伊朗石油
    【新华社七日讯】自从一九五一年八月英伊石油公司在伊朗的石油生产完全停止以后，由于美国加紧排挤英国，两年来美英控制中东石油产量的势力消长情况起了很大的变化。
    英伊石油公司是英国在伊朗唯一的石油公司，这个公司原是英国在中东的“石油帝国”的主要支柱。一九四五年时，伊朗的石油产量约占中东石油总产量的三分之二。在一九五零年，它仍居中东石油产量的第一位，占中东石油总产量的三分之一多。以英伊石油公司为主，英国在整个中东地区控制的石油产量达百分之五十二点九。因此，英伊石油公司的停止生产就立刻使英国在中东和美国的石油竞争处于不利的地位。一九五二年，英国在中东石油产量中控制的百分比激减到百分之三十三。
    大家知道，美国自从战后以来就在加紧侵入中东，和英国争夺对石油的控制权。美国控制的中东石油产量很快地从一九四六年的百分之三十一增加到一九五零年的百分之四十四点四。英伊石油公司停止生产后，美国更趁机竭力扩张它控制下的石油公司的生产，夺取英国的市场。如美国在中东最大的石油公司“阿美石油公司”（在沙特阿拉伯的达兰）一九五二年的原油产量比一九五零年增加了近百分之六十。有美国资本参加的科威特石油公司等其他中东石油公司的原油产量也迅速增加。结果，到一九五二年，在中东全部原油产量中，美国所控制的部分就增加到百分之五十九，而压倒了几十年来一直在中东控制着石油生产的英国。
    同时，在中东的炼油业方面也起了相同的变化。英伊石油公司设在伊朗南部阿巴丹的炼油厂是全世界最大的炼油厂。在一九五零年，它每天炼油四十五万八千桶。阿巴丹炼油厂关闭后，剩下的中东最大炼油厂，就是阿美石油公司在拉斯·塔努拉的炼油厂和巴林石油公司在巴林岛上的炼油厂。这两个都是美国炼油厂，每天共可炼油二十万桶。这样一来，美国在炼油方面也排挤了英国原有的优势地位，而控制了中东的炼油业。一九五二年，美国控制了中东炼油总量的三分之二多。
    由于英伊石油公司停止生产，两年来英国不但在许多石油市场中被美国排挤出来，而且还被迫付出它迫切需要的外汇去向美国购买石油。在一九五一年英伊石油公司停止生产之初，当时的英国财政大臣贾兹克尔承认，英伊石油公司停止生产，估计会使英国每年损失外汇达三亿五千万美元。单单在一九五二年七月至九月三个月内，英国就被迫向美国购买了一亿三千万美元的石油。
    但是美国并不以此为满足，而在积极筹划进一步侵入伊朗，取代前英伊石油公司在伊朗的地位。
