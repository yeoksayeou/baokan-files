　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 31st: The repatriation of prisoners of war through direct repatriation is nearing completion, but many Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who insist on repatriation are still being detained by the U.S. side as hostages.
　　At the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee meeting on August 29th, Colonel Li Pingyi, our side's member, questioned the other side, demanding a response as to whether they intended to repatriate all our prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation but were forcibly detained by the other side, as quickly as possible. The other side's member, after our side presented conclusive evidence and repeatedly pressed for an answer, only stated that they "noted" our side's questioning, but still avoided giving a concrete response to the demands made by the Korean and Chinese side.
　　However, many Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who have been repatriated prove that there are still many Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who should be directly repatriated but are being detained by the U.S. side as hostages. For example, according to Xu Zhengxiang, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war who returned from Busan on the 13th, Wu Chengde, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war, has been held in solitary confinement in a small enclosure in the Busan prisoner of war camp. After the armistice agreement was signed and took effect on the evening of July 27th, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, such as Hu Zhengming, who were lurking in the prisoner of war camp, threatened him to assassinate Wu Chengde, but he sternly refused. According to Du Ziming, a returnee from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, when he was in the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp, he was detained by the U.S. side in an earthen cell along with Wang Fang, Wei Lin, Li Yan, Li Decai, Luo Xingyi, and others, all prisoners of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Wang Fang and Wei Lin have been imprisoned by the U.S. side for about a year. These prisoners of war on our side have not yet been repatriated. In addition, there are Sun Zhenguan and Zhang Zeshi, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who served as prisoner representatives in the incident of detaining U.S. prisoner of war camp commander Dodd. They were arrested by the U.S. side from the prisoner of war camp on June 10th last year and secretly detained, and their whereabouts are still unknown. The U.S. side must make a responsible and honest explanation for these prisoners of war on our side who have not yet been directly repatriated.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 1st: The U.S. prisoner of war camp authorities are using various pretexts to put our prisoners of war into prisons, attempting to forcibly detain them.
　　Park Won-il and Hong Jong-yoon, Korean People's Army prisoners of war who returned on August 31st, said that at least 1,000 prisoners of war on our side were being held in prisons in the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp. In just over half a month from the end of July to August 16th, in the second battalion of the fifth prisoner of war camp where they were detained, four prisoners of war on our side, Cai Genzhi, Li Fenglong, Jin Xiufeng, and one surnamed Zong, were imprisoned without any reason.
　　Cai Genzhi was imprisoned for "disobeying orders" because he refused to pick up toilet paper for an American officer. Li Fenglong's "crime" was because he led the singing of hometown songs. The nineteen-year-old Jin Xiufeng was arrested for resisting the U.S. military's attempt to snatch his cap badge. The person surnamed Zong was a medical worker who was arrested for treating a sick prisoner without the permission of the prisoner of war camp authorities.

### 美方扣留我志愿军许多被俘人员以为人质

    美方扣留我志愿军许多被俘人员以为人质
    【新华社开城三十一日电】直接遣返战俘的遣返工作将近完成，但是还有许多坚持遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员被美方扣留以为人质。
    在八月二十九日战俘遣返委员会会议上，我方委员李平一上校曾向对方提出质问，要求对方答复是否打算将被对方强迫扣留的所有坚持遣返的我方被俘人员予以尽速遣返。对方委员在我方提出确凿证据并一再追问下，仅表示“注意”到我方的质问，但对朝中方面提出的要求仍避不作具体答复。
    但是，许多遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员证明：还有许多应该直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员被美方加以扣留以为人质。例如，据十三日自釜山归来的志愿军被俘人员徐正祥说：中国人民志愿军被俘人员吴成德一直被单独拘禁在釜山战俘营的一个小围场里。七月二十七日晚停战协定签字生效以后，潜伏在战俘营内蒋匪特务胡正明等曾威胁他去谋杀吴成德，被他严词拒绝。据中国人民志愿军归来人员杜资明说：他在巨济岛战俘营的时候，曾与中国人民志愿军被俘人员王芳、魏林、李彦、李德才、骆星一等人一起被美方拘禁在一所土牢里。其中王芳、魏林二人已被美方囚禁了一年左右。现在这些我方被俘人员尚未被遣返回来。另外，还有在扣留美方战俘营长官杜德的事件中，充任战俘代表的中国人民志愿军被俘人员孙振冠和张泽石，他们在去年六月十日被美方从战俘营抓走秘密拘禁起来，至今下落不明。美方必须对这些尚未被直接遣返的我方被俘人员，作出负责和诚实的交代。
    【新华社开城一日电】美方战俘营当局正在以各种藉口把我方被俘人员关进监狱，企图将他们强迫扣留。
    八月三十一日归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员朴元一和洪钟润说，在巨济岛战俘营至少有一千名我方被俘人员被关在监狱里。仅仅从七月底到八月十六日半个多月中，在他们被拘留过的第五战俘营第二大队里，就有蔡根植、李奉龙、金秀凤和一位姓宗的四名我方被俘人员被毫无理由地关进监狱。
    蔡根植因为拒绝替美国军官拾大便纸被加以“违拒命令”罪名关进监狱。李奉龙的“罪名”是因为他领头唱家乡歌曲。十九岁的金秀凤则因为抗拒美军抢夺他的帽徽而被抓去。姓宗的是一位医务工作者，因为未经战俘营当局允许给一个病俘治病而被逮捕。
