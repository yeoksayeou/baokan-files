    At Tanggu New Port (Continued)
    By our reporter Lin Li
      Watery Great Wall
    The long breakwater, like the arms of a giant, protects the waters of the port area, extending into the vast sea.
    The two large dikes are 30.6 kilometers long. They are entirely built of cement and stone, designed to defend against wave impact and resist silt intrusion. Only by walking on the banks of these two dikes can you truly appreciate the greatness and arduousness of the Tanggu New Port project.
     "Let's go see the block manufacturing plant first: that's the first step in building the breakwater project." Wang Jinzeng, the vice chairman of the construction team's trade union, arranged my itinerary.
    The block manufacturing plant arranges many hard stones into a huge square, cementing them together, and then sends them into the sea to build the breakwater. These "blocks," the large ones weighing thirty to forty tons each, and the small ones fifteen tons (two small ones are used as one). The area near Tanggu is all saline-alkali flats and plains, making it difficult to find even a small stone. These thousands upon thousands of tons of stones were all transported from Tangshan and Changli. Comrade Wang Jinzeng, introducing these facts, couldn't help but make a comparison: "The ancients spoke of 'The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains,' but that was ultimately told as a myth. Now, we not only truly moved mountains from hundreds of miles away, but also filled the sea with them. This is truly called moving mountains and overturning the seas!"
    We followed the crane tracks that moved the "blocks," and soon reached the seaside. Here was moored the "Taishan No. 6" crane ship, a "transfer station" for moving "blocks" from land to ship. Wang Jinzeng specifically told me to pay attention to the name "Taishan." He said: We named the crane ship "Taishan" to say that even Mount Taishan, we can move it into the sea.
    At this time, the "Taishan No. 6" crane ship had already moved thirty-odd "blocks" from land onto a barge, and the tugboat had also fastened its ropes, ready to leave the shore. The captain, looking at the people on the shore, shouted, "Comrades going out to sea, come up quickly. Cast off..." With this loud roar, I jumped onto the tugboat and went out to sea.
    The tugboat followed the main channel for about seven kilometers, then turned its direction and headed straight for the north breakwater. Near the north breakwater, the "Taishan No. 5" crane ship was moored. The people building the breakwater live on this ship day and night.
    When they spotted our tugboat, they crowded on the deck to look out from a long distance. As soon as the tugboat approached the crane ship, a group of young people jumped aboard. They asked the people on the tugboat: Did you bring the rice and flour sent by our mothers? Are there any cigarettes sent by our sweethearts? Is there today's newspaper? What's the news on land...? The people on the tugboat, while answering this series of questions, handed over the rice and flour. In this chaotic moment, I followed a young man who had grabbed the cigarettes and newspaper and jumped onto the "Taishan No. 5" crane ship.
    This young man was named Liu Jizhi, twenty-four years old, and was the propaganda committee member of the Youth League branch. On the right side of his forehead, he had a finger-length scar. Next to it were two or three purple bumps. He said he got these from bumping into stones while moving them. But then he explained, "This doesn't count as a work injury. In this kind of work, it's common to fall or bump into something, nobody cares." He said that there were more than thirty people working on this ship, most of them young, including ten Youth League members. Their task is to throw the rubble into the sea, above the water surface, and then sort out a flat wall base from it, and pile up those fifteen-ton and twenty-four-ton "blocks" to build a watery Great Wall. In this way, each of them moves at least 40,000 catties of stone every day. They live at sea for a long time and work extremely hard. Because their work must be determined by the rise and fall of the tide, it is extremely intensive. Liu Jizhi said: We can't be like the people on land, working eight hours a day step by step. Our foothold is this ship. When the tide comes in, we hurry to seize the time to work, sometimes working fourteen or fifteen hours a day. When the tide recedes, the ship is trapped in the mud, and we can't even move.
    The young people who work here are all brave and strong, and all are excellent swimmers. As long as the work requires it, they will not hesitate to raise their hands and jump into the sea with a "plop." Their skin is tanned by the sun. In addition to the erosion of seawater, a layer of white alkali appears. Their work is hard and intense, but they are very happy. As soon as the work stops, they talk, sing, and have fun. When I was talking to Liu Jizhi, some people were learning from Xin Fengxia to sing "Liu Qiao Files a Complaint," and some were learning from Wang Kun to sing "The White-Haired Girl." More people liked to sing the song "Heroes Conquer the Dadu River." Even those who can't sing are learning that heroic, unrestrained tune: "The boat is leaving..."
    That night, I slept in the cabin with the people building the watery Great Wall.
    The next morning, the engineers were going to a farther place to see the end of the breakwater. Captain Zhang Qinglü called a landing craft parked a hundred meters away to send them. He summoned them with a whistle. But the people on the landing craft said, "The tide is going out soon, we're afraid we won't be able to come back." The captain thought they were being lazy, and his face flushed with anger. He grabbed the whistle rope and pulled it hard. The whistle sounded a long "woo-woo-woo-woo-," this heart-stirring roar represents the strictest and most urgent order. The people on the landing craft didn't say anything more and drove the boat over. The captain's anger hadn't disappeared, he said to the people, as if talking to himself, "You can't be careless when working on a ship." It turns out that the crew's high level of discipline is cultivated in these daily lives.
    The landing craft is the fastest means of transportation at sea. When it travels, it is like a swallow flying in the sky, strong, light, and fast. I also went with the engineers to the end of the north breakwater.
    We strolled on the breakwater. Ahead was the boundless ocean, and on the left and right were rolling waves. Behind, this Great Wall built of millions of tons of stones was like a thin line. Although the breakwater was as stable as Mount Tai, it always felt like it was shaking and moving. Here, the breakwater has three different shapes, clearly delineating three different eras. This breakwater was originally built during the Japanese imperialist rule. At that time, the "blocks" they used to build the dike weighed only twenty-three tons and were made of cement. Now it has turned black, and the sea water has washed away the edges and corners of the "blocks," and many places need to be repaired and reinforced. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, this dike was also repaired. But they changed the cement "blocks" into cement "circles." At that time, they also boasted that it was a "creation" that saved national wealth. This circle is hollow in the middle, 2.5 meters high, 2.6 meters in diameter, and 0.3 meters thick, with a total weight of only thirteen tons. They threw rubble into the middle of the circle to replace the cement blocks. However, because the stones and the "circle" were not combined into a whole, the rubble naturally sank soon. The thin cement "circle" could not withstand the impact of the waves, so some are now completely overturned, some are leaning to one side, and some are riddled with holes. They have lost their effective function and must be completely reworked. Now - in the people's era, the "blocks" used to build the breakwater are made of the hardest granite. The waves cannot wash away its edges and corners, and nothing can knock it down. From a distance, it looks like a neat and whitewashed wall. The people who build the breakwater say to anyone they see: "This will never break. You can even drive a jeep on it!" Indeed, a medium-sized jeep can come up and drive around swaggeringly.
    Here, I also heard a strange thing: it turns out that many of the stones (limestone) thrown under the "blocks" and "circles" have been eaten rotten by insects. The workers brought me a stone weighing more than a hundred catties, which had dozens of holes on it, like a hornet's nest. Each hole has an insect, and the insect's shell is hard, about the size of a peanut. The staff here can't explain what this insect is called, and it's hard to estimate the extent of its harm. They said: The insect and the stone specimens eaten by the insect have been sent to the Chinese Academy of Sciences for analysis and testing. They believe that Chinese scientists will come to a clear conclusion and give preventive measures. But they hope it will be as soon as possible. Because the specimens were sent months ago, and there has been no response so far.

    在塘沽新港（续）
    本报记者  林里
      水上长城
    长长的防波堤，像一个巨人的两臂，护围着港区的水面，伸向茫茫的海里。
    两条大堤长达三十点六公里。完全是用水泥、石块筑成的。是用来防御波浪冲击、抵挡淤泥侵袭的。只有走上这两条大堤的堤岸，你才能真正体会到塘沽新港工程的伟大和艰巨。
     “先到方块制造厂看看吧：那是建筑防波堤工程的第一步。”筑港工程队的工会副主席王金增同志给我安排着行程。
    方块制造厂，是把许多坚硬的石块，排成一个巨大的方形，用水泥把它凝结在一起，然后送到海里——砌防波堤。这种“方块”，大的每个体重三、四十吨，小的也有十五吨（小的两个当一个用）。塘沽附近全是咸滩和平原，要找一块小小的石头都不容易。这些成千成万吨的石头，都是从唐山、昌黎运来的。王金增同志介绍着这些情况，情不自禁的打了个比喻：“古人们说‘愚公移山’，但那终究是当神话故事来说的。现在我们不光真的把几百里地以外的山移了过来，并且还要把它填到海里。这才真真叫做移山倒海哩！”
    我们顺着搬“方块”的起重吊车的铁轨走去，不远就是海边。这里停着“泰山六号”起重船，是把“方块”从陆地移到船上的“转运站”。王金增特别叫我注意“泰山号”这个名字。他说：我们给起重船取名“泰山”号，就是说：即便是泰山，我们也能把它搬到海里。
    这时，“泰山六号”起重船，已把三十几个
  “方块”从陆地搬上了驳船，拖轮也拴好了绳索，准备离岸。船长望着岸上的来人，喊道：“出海的同志赶快上来。开船了……”我就随着这嘹亮的吼声，跳上了拖轮，出海了。
    拖轮顺着主航道，走了大约七公里，就调转方向，直奔北防波堤而去。在北防波堤跟前，停着
  “泰山五号”起重船。修筑防波堤的人们，就成天成夜地住在这只船上。
    当他们发现了我们这只拖轮时，老远老远就挤在甲板上眺望。拖轮刚一靠近起重船，一伙青年人就跳了上来。他们问拖轮上的人：是不是带来了母亲送给的米面？是不是有爱人送给的香烟？是不是有今天的报纸？陆地上有什么消息……在拖轮上的人，一面回答着这一连串的问题，一面把米呀面呀的递过去。在这乱烘烘的一刹那间，我随着一个抢去了香烟、报纸的青年，跳上了“泰山五号”起重船。
    这位青年叫刘吉志，二十四岁，是青年团支部的宣传委员。他前额的右边，带着一条手指头长的血疤。旁边还有两三个紫色的疙瘩。他说这是搬石头时碰伤的。但接着解释说：“这可不算工伤。干这种活，摔一块，碰一块是常事，谁也不在乎。”他说，在这只船上工作的共有三十几个人，绝大部分是青年，其中有十个青年团员。他们的任务是把乱石头抛在海里，超出水面，然后从中整理出一条坦平的墙基，把那十五吨、二十四吨的“方块”垒上去，筑成一条水上长城。就这样，他们每人每天顶少搬动四万斤石头。他们长时地生活在海上，工作异常紧张。因为他们的工作必须根据潮水的涨落来决定。所以带有极大的突击性。刘吉志说：我们可不能像陆上的人们，按步就班地一天工作八点钟。我们的立脚点就是这只船。潮水一来，赶快抢时间工作，有时候一天工作十四、五个钟头。潮水一落，船就陷在泥里，那就连动都不能动了。
    在这里工作的青年，个个勇敢强壮，个个是出色的游泳能手。只要工作需要，他们便毫不犹豫地把两手一举，纵身一跃，“扑通”一声跳在海里。他们的皮肤，被太阳晒得黑黝黝的。加上海水的浸蚀，又泛起了一层白碱。他们的工作艰苦、紧张，然而心情十分愉快。只要工作一停下来，就说的说，唱的唱，玩个不亦乐乎。当我和刘吉志谈话的时候，就有人学着新凤霞唱“刘巧告状”，有人学着王昆演唱“白毛女”。更多的人喜欢唱“英雄战胜大渡河”的歌曲。连那不会唱的人，也学着那英雄奔放、豪迈无羁的调子：“开船了………”
    这天夜里，我和修筑水上长城的人们一起睡在船舱里。
    第二天早晨，工程人员要到更远的地方，去看防波堤的尽头。船长张庆绿叫停泊在百公尺以外的登陆艇去送。他用汽笛呼唤。而登陆艇上的人们说：“快退潮了，去了怕回不来。”船长以为他们偷懒，一下气红了脸，就使劲地捉住汽笛的绳索，狠狠地拉着。汽笛发出“呜——呜——呜——呜——”地四声长鸣，这动人心弦的吼声，代表着最严厉、也是最紧急的命令。登陆艇上的人们也就再不说什么，把艇开了过来。船长的怒气还没有消失，他对着人，又像在自语着：“船上做事，一点不能马虎。”原来，船员们的高度的纪律精神，就是在这些日常生活中养成的。
    登陆艇是海上最快的交通工具，行驶起来，就像燕子飞翔在天空，矫健、轻快，疾驰如飞。我也随着工程人员，一起到了北防波堤的尽头。
    我们漫步在防波堤上，前看是无边的海洋，左右是滚滚翻腾的巨浪，后面，这条由千百万吨石头筑起的长城，却像一条纤细的线。尽管防波堤稳如泰山，眼里总觉得它在摇晃、动弹。在这里，防波堤有三种不同形状，恰好划清了三个不同时代。这条防波堤，最初是日本帝国主义统治时期建筑的。那时，他们筑堤用的“方块”，只有二十三吨重，是水泥制成的。现在已经变成黑色，海水冲去了“方块”的棱角，许多地方需要修补、加固。国民党反动派统治时期，也修过这条大堤。但他们把水泥
  “方块”，改成了水泥“圆圈”。当时还吹嘘说，是节省国家资财的“创造”。这种圆圈当中是空的，高二点五公尺，直径二点六公尺，厚度零点三公尺，总共只有十三吨重。他们把圆圈当中投以乱石，以代替水泥方块。但因石头和“圆圈”没有结合成一个整体，不久乱石自然下沉了。单薄的水泥“圆圈”，经不起海浪的冲击，所以现在有的完全倾倒，有的东倒西歪，有的溃烂不堪，已经失去了它的应有效能，必须全部返工。现在——人民的时代，建筑防波堤用的“方块”，是最坚硬的花岗石制成的。海浪冲不去它的棱角，又没有什么东西能够把它打倒。远远看是一道整齐而刷白的墙壁。修筑防波堤的人们，见人就说：“这，永也没有个坏。你还可以在上边开吉普车哩！”的确，上来一辆中型吉普，都可以大摇大摆地开起来。
    在这里，我还听到一件奇怪的事：原来抛在“方块”和“圆圈”底下的那些石头（属石灰石），不少已被虫子吃烂。工人们搬给我一块百多斤重的石头，那上面就有几十个窟窿，像马蜂窠一样。每个窟窿里都有一个虫子，虫子的外壳坚硬，有花生豆那么大。这里的职工人员不能解释这叫什么虫子，也很难估计它的危害程度。他们说：虫子、被虫子吃坏的石头标本，已送中国科学院分析、化验去了。他们相信中国的科学家们，会得出明确结论，并给以预防之法。不过他们希望愈快愈好。因为标本送去数月，至今还没有一个回音。
