    Sichuan Rural Areas Establish Grain Purchasing Network
    A grain purchasing network has been established in the broad rural areas of Sichuan Province, ensuring the overfulfillment of grain purchase tasks.
    There are now more than 2,100 grain purchasing stations in Sichuan Province, nearly double the number last year. In September, Longchang County added eleven regular purchasing stations, allowing farmers in the county to sell grain within a distance of no more than fifteen *li*. In addition, grain departments in various regions have also organized many mobile purchasing teams to go deep into remote rural areas to purchase grain. The establishment of these fixed and regular purchasing stations has extended the purchasing network to the broad rural areas. Moreover, all purchasing stations have paid attention to simplifying purchasing procedures, improving work efficiency, and ensuring the supply of materials this year, greatly satisfying the farmers' requirements for selling grain. According to statistics from the grain department, the province's grain purchases in August this year increased by 37.7 percent compared with the same period last year.

    四川农村建立粮食收购网
    四川省广大农村建立了粮食收购网，保证了购粮任务的超额完成。
    四川全省现在已有粮食收购站二千一百多个，较去年增加近一倍。九月份隆昌县又增设了十一个定期收购站，该县农民在不超过十五里路程内就可售粮。此外，各地粮食部门还组织了很多的流动收购组，深入偏僻乡村巡回购粮。这些固定收购站和定期收购站的建立，使收购网遍及广大农村，又加上各收购站今年都注意简化收购手续，提高工作效率，保证物资供应工作，大大满足了农民售粮要求。据粮食部门统计，全省今年八月份粮食收购量较去年同期增加百分之三十七点七。
