Xinhua News Agency, Ulanhot, 21st. The autumn crops in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are being harvested across the board, marking an unprecedented bumper harvest in the region in the eight years since liberation. According to estimates based on the harvest in the four eastern leagues, the average yield has reached over 95%. In the fertile areas along the Liao River and Xin Kai River, the average yield has reached 100%. The yields everywhere have generally exceeded the local average for normal years, and many large-scale high-yield fields have emerged. Some of these high-yield fields have already met the Inner Mongolia's high-yield reward standards for this year. For example, in Tongliao County of Jerim League, the average yield of various crops has reached 3,400 catties per hectare (one hectare equals fifteen mu). The highest yield of millet in the Dongsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative reached 12,000 catties per hectare, exceeding the county's highest harvest record in 1950 by 44%. The county has 33,000 hectares of large-scale high-yield fields, of which about 500 units, including demonstration farms, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, or individual farmers, have met Inner Mongolia's high-yield reward standards for this year.

This spring, the Autonomous Region organized labor models, directors of agricultural production cooperatives, and leaders of mutual aid teams to learn from the high-yield experience in Zhaoyuan County, Northeast China. This greatly enhanced the farmers' enthusiasm and confidence in improving agricultural techniques. Most agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams adopted high-yield techniques such as equidistant wide sowing, thinning, seedling protection, and applying fertilizer in stages. Under the leadership of production mutual aid organizations, ordinary farmers also reformed their agricultural production techniques. Therefore, this year's cultivation generally achieved the requirements of uniform, complete, and vigorous seedlings. At the same time, due to dense planting, the number of plants per hectare also increased compared to the past. In Kailu County, the number of millet seedlings per hectare increased by 100,000 compared to last year. Mongolian and Han farmers also vigorously carried out drought prevention and resistance movements. In addition to generally adopting timely early sowing and moisture conservation to resist drought, they also dug irrigation canals and wells to find springs. In Zhaowuda League, where spring drought was relatively severe, farmers used snow and ice accumulated in the Greater Khingan Mountains to irrigate more than 2,900 hectares of land. After summer, there was more rainfall. Party and government leaders at all levels personally went to the countryside to lead farmers in flood prevention and disaster relief. On the banks of the Liao River and Xin Kai River, where the flood situation was urgent, Naqin Shuang'er, deputy director of the Eastern District Administrative Office of the Autonomous Region, personally led Mongolian and Han farmers to organize 2,700 flood prevention teams to fight the floods. Although the flood level of the two rivers once exceeded the guaranteed water level, the farmers' courageous protection finally saved the embankments, enabling hundreds of thousands of hectares of fertile land on both sides of the Liao River and Xin Kai River to achieve a bumper harvest.

    内蒙古自治区今年大秋作物空前丰收
    【新华社乌兰浩特二十一日讯】内蒙古自治区大秋作物已全面进行收割，这是全区自解放后八年来空前的一次丰收。根据东部四个盟收割的情况估计，平均产量已达到九成五以上，土地肥沃的辽河和新开河两岸，平均产量已达到十成。各地普遍超过了当地常年产量，并出现了许多大面积的丰产田，有些丰产田已达到内蒙古今年丰产奖励的标准。如哲里木盟的通辽县各种作物每垧（一垧十五市亩）平均产量都达到三千四百斤，东升农业生产合作社每垧谷子的最高产量达到一万二千斤，超过一九五零年该县丰收最高纪录的百分之四十四。全县有三万三千垧大面积的丰产田，其中约有五百个包括示范农庄、农业生产合作社、互助组或个体农民的单位都达到了内蒙古今年丰产奖励的标准。
    今年春天，自治区曾组织劳动模范、农业生产合作社主任、互助组组长等到东北肇源县实地学习了那里的丰产经验，大大提高了农民们对改进农业技术的热情和信心，大部分农业生产合作社、互助组都采用了等距宽播、间苗、保苗、分期追肥等丰产经验，一般农民在生产互助组织的带动下，也进行了农业生产技术的改革，所以今年耕作中普遍达到了苗匀、苗全、苗旺的要求。同时由于密植结果，每垧地的棵数也比过去增加了，开鲁县每垧谷子比去年增加十万棵苗。蒙、汉族农民并大力开展防旱抗旱运动，除普遍采取适时早播、保墒抗旱的办法外，还开渠灌溉、打井挖泉。在春旱比较严重的昭乌达盟，农民曾利用大兴安岭的积雪、积冰，浇了二千九百多垧地。入夏后雨水较多，各级党、政领导人都亲自下乡带领农民防洪抢荒。在汛情紧急的辽河和新开河两岸，自治区东部区行政公署副主任那钦双和尔亲自领导蒙、汉族农民组织了二千七百个防汛队，向洪水作斗争，虽然两河洪水位曾一度超过保证水位，但在农民们勇敢的防护下，终于保住了大堤，使辽河、新开河两岸数十万垧良田获得了丰收。
