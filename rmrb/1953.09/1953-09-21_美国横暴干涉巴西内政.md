　　Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, September 17th: The Uruguayan newspaper "El Bien Público" published on September 16th an official report from the Chilean ambassador to Rio de Janeiro to the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the United States' serious interference in Brazil's internal affairs. The Chilean ambassador's report pointed out that the United States is exerting pressure on Brazil to prevent it from selling iron ore to People's Democratic countries on terms more profitable than selling to the United States. The Chilean ambassador, citing reliable sources, said that the U.S. State Department had notified the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that if Brazil sold iron ore to Czechoslovakia and Poland, the United States would halt the delivery of American goods to Brazil until the barter between the two countries was completed.

    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社蒙得维的亚十七日讯：乌拉圭“公理报”在九月十六日发表了智利驻里约热内卢大使关于美国严重干涉巴西内政事给智利外交部的官方报告。智利大使的报告指出美国正向巴西施行压力，阻止巴西把铁矿以比卖给美国更能获利的条件卖给人民民主国家。智利大使在报告中引证可靠人士的消息说，美国国务院通知巴西外交部说，如果巴西把铁矿卖给捷克斯洛伐克和波兰，美国就将在两国换货没有完成以前，停止把美国货物交给巴西。
