    朝鲜国营商业逐渐恢复销售额日有增加
    鸭绿江朝鲜客船航运已经恢复
    【新华社平壤十六日电】由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在停战前后继续不断地实行了降低物价和保障人民生活的政策，朝鲜北部人民的购买力正在不断提高，国营商业亦在迅速恢复。在各市镇的国营商店、消费合作社、市场和农村的市集，顾客络绎不绝。人们除购置食物和用具外，并纷纷购置修建住宅和暖炕用的各种工具、材料和秋、冬两季用的服装。学生们成群结队地在选购各种文具。
    为了满足人民不断增长的需要，朝鲜商业省所属各商业部门在停战后积极进行恢复和扩展商业网的工作，计划在今年下半年把商业网扩展到上半年的百分之一百二十四。平壤、南浦等城市新近增设的国营百货店都已开始营业。平壤市最近还将增设六个百货店和分别销售工业品、水果、食品等物的商店。晚间，各城市的街头上还出现了国营商店派出的许多流动零售队。在商业网迅速扩展的情况下，各个国营商店、合作社的销售额不但没有降低，而且也有增加。其中，属于平壤市商业管理所的商店在停战后的销售额，就比战争时期平均约增加了百分之四十。
    【新华社平壤十六日电】在战争期间中断了的鸭绿江朝鲜客船航运，已从九月五日恢复通航。从新义州开往龙岩浦、薪岛和多沙岛方面的客船每天早晨自新义州起航；往返于新义州和清城镇之间的客船隔天航行一次。由于鸭绿江客船的恢复运行，西海岸和义州、碧潼方面的水上交通更加便利。
