    Do a Good Job in Organizing the Enrollment of New Students in National Institutions of Higher Education
    The unified enrollment results for national institutions of higher education in 1953 will be announced today. This year, the enrollment work of national institutions of higher education has been smoother than in the past few years. This is because the situation of the candidates has undergone great changes.
    These changes are manifested in: First, young students in various regions are very enthusiastic about applying for institutions of higher education. A total of more than 80,000 people applied in the 73 examination areas across the country, which is more than any year in history. This is the result of the development of school education, especially senior high school education, in New China. Second, the composition of the candidates is better. Due to the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government's implementation of the policy of opening up to workers and peasants in school education, this year's new applicants are largely composed of intellectual youths and children of workers and peasants, including graduates of workers and peasants' short-term middle schools, in-service cadres from government agencies, and employees from factories and mines. This has greatly strengthened the political quality of students in institutions of higher education. Third, the students' level of cultural knowledge is higher than last year. In recent years, senior high schools have worked hard to overcome chaotic phenomena and strengthen teaching work. Most schools also organized students to make up lessons and review appropriately during the summer vacation. Therefore, this year's candidates' total scores in various subjects have also greatly improved compared to last year. The above situation shows that this year's enrollment task of more than 71,000 people in national institutions of higher education is relatively guaranteed both in quantity and quality.
    This year's distribution method for enrolling new students has also been improved compared to last year, mainly in: First, when distributing new students, we should not only consider the needs of national construction first, but also appropriately take care of students' personal aspirations for further education, so as to teach students according to their aptitude. Second, the admission standards for various departments and majors in institutions of higher education are based on the teaching requirements, with a focus on the subject scores related to the main courses of the students' major. For example, science and engineering focuses on the examination scores of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Third, when specifically assigning new students to various schools and departments, we strive to make the level of new students in the same major in a certain school roughly uniform, in order to facilitate teaching work.
    Because this year's number of candidates is large and the quality is good; and because the method of distributing new students has been improved, we believe that this year's enrollment plan can be fully realized.
    However, in the past few years, we have not paid enough attention to ideological education for high school graduates regarding further education, which easily leads them to have some incorrect or not completely correct ideas on the issue of further education. For example, in the choice of departments and majors, they only want to enter departments such as engineering, medicine, and art, and are unwilling to enter teacher training and science departments such as mathematics, political science and law, finance and economics, and physical education. Those who want to enter engineering are only willing to enter general mechanical manufacturing and radio engineering and telecommunications, and are unwilling to enter geology, mining, civil engineering, and the military industry. In terms of the length of study, they only want to enter four-year or five-year undergraduate programs, and are unwilling to enter specialized courses. In the choice of schools, they only want to enter a few institutions of higher education with better conditions, and are unwilling to enter general institutions of higher education. In the choice of enrollment areas, they only want to enter schools in large cities (mainly Beijing), and are unwilling to enter schools in medium-sized cities. In addition, some students are willing to enter schools in their own region and are unwilling to enter schools in other regions. The above-mentioned ideas not only exist among students, but also among some parents and teachers. This situation, coupled with the relatively tight schedule of this year's enrollment work and certain shortcomings in the distribution work, may cause some difficulties in the registration and enrollment of new students. We must overcome these difficulties in order to fully realize this year's enrollment plan for institutions of higher education.
    As everyone knows, whether the enrollment work can be done well has a significant impact on ensuring the quality of training senior construction talents in institutions of higher education; and the planned distribution and organization of new students to register and enroll on time is the decisive link in realizing the entire enrollment plan. Therefore, we hope that relevant parties can cooperate with each other and earnestly do a good job in the final stage of enrollment, that is, the work of organizing new students to enroll.
    First of all, the propaganda departments of local Party committees, education administrative departments, the New Democratic Youth League and student union organizations, and high school teachers should, according to the list of new students distributed by the National Higher Education Enrollment Committee, conduct necessary publicity and education work for the local new students. It is necessary to repeatedly explain to them that the focus of the country's entire construction undertaking is indeed industry, first of all heavy industry, but this does not mean that industrial construction can be carried out in isolation; on the contrary, various construction undertakings must be effectively coordinated. Various national construction undertakings must be developed in a certain proportion, and the training of senior construction talents must also be carried out according to a certain plan in order to meet the needs of all aspects. It is wrong to think that only industrial construction or a certain undertaking in industrial construction is important, while other construction and other undertakings are dispensable. The state's planned distribution of new students is based on the needs of various construction undertakings for cadres, and appropriately takes into account personal aspirations for further education. Generally speaking, the needs of national construction and personal aspirations for further education have their consistent aspects (this is the main aspect), but there are also inconsistent aspects. When personal aspirations conflict with national needs, one should consciously give up personal aspirations to obey the state's distribution. This is beneficial to both the country and the individual. This is a concrete manifestation of our patriotism. All relevant parties should be good at using various methods such as local newspapers, radio broadcasts, as well as reports, forums, and individual talks, to criticize views that do not take into account the needs of national construction and one-sidedly emphasize personal enrollment aspirations; on the one hand, they should introduce typical examples of those who take care of national needs and consciously obey the distribution, to educate and inspire everyone's patriotic enthusiasm.
    Secondly, we must earnestly do a good job in organizing new students to register and enroll on time. We hope that students can all register and attend classes on time, without hesitation or idling away their studies. In order to ensure that new students arrive at school on time, all relevant parties should consult with the local transportation departments to solve the problem of transportation for students entering the school, help poor students solve the difficulties of travel expenses, and ensure that more than 10,000 new students distributed from East China, Central South, and Southwest China to North China, Northeast, and Northwest China can smoothly arrive at school. In addition, we also hope that students will promote the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance, and jointly solve the difficulties in life during the journey, so as to arrive at school safely and in a timely manner and register for classes on time. Most schools will start in early October this year, and there are only half a month between the announcement of the list and the start of school. If new students are not organized to register and enroll on time, it will be difficult for the school's original teaching plan to be realized as scheduled.
    Third, we require all institutions of higher education to earnestly do a good job in welcoming new students. First of all, we must introduce to new students the nature and tasks of the school, the specific training objectives of the departments and majors, and the specific conditions of the school's teachers and equipment, so that they have sufficient understanding of the majors they are about to start learning, as well as the importance of these majors in national construction, so that they love the majors they study. This is an ideological education work that must be done well before formal teaching begins. In addition, the school administration should try its best to arrange the houses needed by new students and the necessary supplies for living and studying, so that they can settle down quickly after arriving at school. At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize the original students of the school to actively help new students solve the difficulties in life and study, help new students familiarize themselves with the various rules and regulations of the school, and establish mutual assistance and friendship among students through organizations such as the Party, the Youth League, and the Student Union, and hold necessary forums and get-togethers.
    Finally, we require all relevant parties to appropriately educate and help those candidates who have not been admitted, so that those with low levels can continue to conduct self-study and tutoring to improve their knowledge level; those with weak physiques should strengthen physical exercise, and take appropriate rest when necessary to improve their health; those who lack documents should apply to certain agencies in order to apply next year.
    We hope that all relevant parties will cooperate closely and do a good job in all aspects of the enrollment of new students to ensure the full realization of this year's enrollment plan.

### 做好组织全国高等学校新生入学的工作

    做好组织全国高等学校新生入学的工作
    一九五三年度全国高等学校统一招生今天开始发榜。今年全国高等学校的招生工作比过去几年都要顺利。这是因为考生的情况有了很大的变化。
    这种变化表现在：第一，各地青年学生报考高等学校十分踊跃。全国七十三个考区共有八万多人报考，人数之多超过了历史上的任何一年。这是新中国学校教育首先是高级中学发展的结果。第二，考生成分较好。由于中国共产党和人民政府在学校教育方面贯彻执行了向工农开门的方针，今年报考的新生成分，工农出身的知识青年及工农子弟占很大的比例，其中包括工农速成中学毕业生、机关在职干部和厂矿企业里的职工。这就大大地加强了高等学校学生的政治质量。第三，学生的文化知识水平比去年的为高。由于近年来高级中学努力克服混乱现象，加强教学工作，今年暑期大部分学校又适当地组织学生进行了补课和复习，所以今年考生的各科考试成绩总分数比之去年也有很大提高。上述情况说明，今年全国高等学校七万一千多人的招生任务不论在数量上和质量上都是比较有保证的。
    今年对于录取新生的分配办法，比之去年也有所改进，主要表现在：第一，在分配新生时，不但首先要根据国家建设的需要，而且也要适当地照顾学生的个人升学志愿，以便做到因材施教。第二，高等学校各科系专业的录取标准，是根据教学上的要求，以学生所学专业的主要课程有关的学科成绩为主。例如理工科着重数学、物理、化学三科的考试成绩。第三，向各校各科系专业具体分配新生时，力求某个学校同一个专业的新生程度大体整齐，以利教学工作。
    由于今年考生的数量较多、质量较好；又由于分配新生的办法已有改进，我们相信今年的招生计划是可以全部实现的。
    但是，过去几年来，我们平日不太注意向高中毕业生进行有关升学的思想教育，这就容易使他们在升学问题上产生一些不正确的或不完全正确的思想。例如在科系专业的选择上，只愿入工科、医科、艺术等科系，不愿入师范和理科中的数学、政法、财经以及体育等科系。而愿入工科的又只愿入普通机械制造和无线电工学和电讯等专业，不愿入地质、采矿、土木建筑、兵工等专业。在修业年限上，只愿入四年制或五年制本科，不愿入专修科。在学校选择上，只愿入少数条件较好的高等学校，不愿入一般的高等学校。在入学地区的选择上，只愿入大城市（主要是北京）的学校，不愿入中等城市的学校。此外，一部分学生愿入本地区的学校，不愿入外地区的学校。上述种种思想不仅在学生中存在着，而且在一部分学生家长和教师中也存在着。这种情况加上今年的招生工作时间比较紧迫，分配工作中还有某些缺点，就可能在新生报到入学方面造成一些困难。我们必须克服这些困难，才能够全部实现今年高等学校的招生计划。
    大家知道，能否做好招生工作对于保证高等学校培养高级建设人才的质量是有重大影响的；而有计划地分配和组织新生按时报到入学，则是实现整个招生计划的决定环节。因此，我们希望有关方面能够互相配合，认真做好招生的最后阶段工作，即组织新生入学的工作。
    首先各地党委宣传部门、教育行政部门、新民主主义青年团和学生联合会组织以及高中教师，要根据全国高等学校招生委员会公布的新生分配名单，向当地新生进行必要的宣传教育工作。要反复地向他们说明：国家整个建设事业的重点固然是工业，首先是重工业，但这并不是说工业建设可以孤立地进行；相反，各种建设事业是必须有效地配合进行的。国家各种建设事业必须按照一定的比例发展，而高级建设人才的培养也就必须按照一定的计划进行，才能适应各方面的需要。以为只有工业建设或工业建设中的某种事业才是重要的，而其他建设和其他事业都是可有可无的看法是错误的。国家有计划地分配新生是根据各种建设事业对干部的需要，并适当地照顾到个人升学志愿来进行的。一般地说，国家建设的需要和个人的升学志愿有其一致的方面（这是主要的方面），但也有其不一致的方面。当个人的志愿和国家需要发生矛盾时，就应该自觉地放弃个人的志愿来服从国家的分配。这不论对国家对个人都是有利的。这就是我们爱国主义的一种具体表现。各有关方面应该善于运用当地的报纸、广播以及报告会、座谈会和个别谈话等多种多样的方式，一方面批判那些不照顾国家建设的需要、片面强调个人入学志愿的看法；一方面要介绍那些照顾国家需要、自觉地服从分配的典型例子，来教育和启发大家的爱国主义热情。
    其次，要认真做好组织新生按时报到入学的工作。我们希望同学们都能够按时报到入校上课，不要犹疑徘徊，自荒学业。为了保证新生按时到校，各有关方面应该和当地交通部门协商解决入校学生的交通工具的问题，要帮助贫苦同学解决旅费的困难，要使华东、中南、西南分配到华北、东北、西北地区的一万余新生能够顺利地到达学校。另外，我们也希望同学们发扬友爱互助精神，共同解决旅途中的生活上的困难，以便平安而又及时地到达学校，按时注册上课。今年大部分学校在十月上旬开学，而从发榜到开学，中间仅有半个月的时间，假如不组织新生按时报到入学，那就会使学校原定的教学计划难于如期实现。
    第三，我们要求各个高等学校要认真做好迎接新生的工作，首先要向新生介绍学校性质、任务和所设科系专业的具体培养目标以及学校的师资、设备等方面的具体情况，使他们对自己将要开始学习的专业，以及这些专业在国家建设中的重要性有足够的认识，使他们爱好自己所学的专业。这是正式授课前必须做好的思想教育工作。另外，学校行政方面要尽量把新生所需的房子以及生活上和学习上必需的用品安排妥当，使他们到校后能够很快地安定下来。同时要动员学校原有的学生主动地帮助新生解决生活上和学习上的困难，帮助新生熟悉学校的各种规章和制度，通过党和青年团以及学生联合会等组织，举行必要的座谈会和联欢晚会等活动，来建立同学间的互助友爱关系。
    最后，我们要求各有关方面要适当地教育和帮助那些没有被录取的考生，使程度低的人，能够继续进行自修和补习，提高自己的知识水平；体格弱的人要加强身体锻炼，必要时作适当休养，以增进自己的健康；缺乏证件的人，要向一定的机关去申请，以便明年报考。
    我们希望各有关方面密切配合，做好新生入学的各项工作，保证今年招生计划的全部实现。
