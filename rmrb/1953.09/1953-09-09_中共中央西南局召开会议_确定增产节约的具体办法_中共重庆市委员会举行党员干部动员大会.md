    【Benbao Chongqing Eight Telegraph】In early September, the CCP Central Southwest Bureau held a meeting to discuss increasing production, practicing economy, and exceeding the national plan. After reviewing the completion of the annual national plan in the region's industrial and agricultural production, commerce, taxation, and other aspects, the meeting believed that the most urgent task in the region's financial and economic work is to increase production, increase income, practice strict economy, and tighten expenditures, so that the previously unfulfilled plans can be completed in the coming months and strive to overfulfill them. The meeting considered that increasing industrial and agricultural production and completing the national production plan are the basic aspects of increasing income, while expanding commodity circulation is the key to increasing income, completing tax tasks, and opening up sales channels for industrial and agricultural products. To this end, industrial and mining enterprises must strengthen planning management, find tricks, tap potential, and carry out production increase and economy campaigns. In terms of agricultural production, in addition to vigorously organizing the autumn harvest, in disaster areas, it is necessary to mobilize replanting and rushing to plant late autumn crops, and expand the purchase of local specialties. Commercial departments should strengthen business management, accelerate capital turnover, expand sales and purchases in a planned manner, and vigorously organize material exchanges. For the goods currently accumulated in several ports, all means of transportation must be mobilized to carry out rush transportation and accelerate commodity transfer. In order to increase tax revenue, all localities should carefully calculate accounts, strive to open up tax sources, and carry out the struggle against tax evasion. In order to practice strict economy and tighten expenditures, the meeting decided that all expenditures should be prioritized, and those that can be avoided should be avoided, and those that can be postponed should be postponed; at the same time, the establishment plan should be strictly implemented to reduce redundant personnel. In addition, it particularly emphasized that grain losses should be reduced and grain should be saved from preservation, processing, and transportation. Finally, the method of mobilization and communication was determined.
    The CCP Chongqing Municipal Committee held a mobilization meeting for Party member cadres in the city on the 8th to increase production and practice economy. At the meeting, Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, made a report entitled "Strive to Guarantee the Completion and Overfulfillment of the National Plan." Cao Diqiu specifically examined and analyzed the situation and reasons for the failure of various enterprises to complete the national plan, and called on all employees to mobilize and launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy. To this end, all units must conduct in-depth mobilization and formulate practical plans for increasing production and practicing economy. Industrial and mining enterprises should strengthen planning management and carry out production increase and economy campaigns. Commercial departments should actively expand commodity circulation and meet the needs of the people. At the same time, in taxation, it is necessary to overcome the conservative thinking of cadres, expand tax sources, and combine with the struggle against tax evasion to strive to overfulfill tax tasks. Cao Diqiu finally said: As long as we can fully mobilize the masses, implement the Party's policies, grasp the key, tap potential, and strive to increase production, increase income, practice strict economy, and tighten expenditures, we will surely be able to overfulfill the national plan.

    中共中央西南局召开会议
    确定增产节约的具体办法
    中共重庆市委员会举行党员干部动员大会
    【本报重庆八日电】九月初，中共中央西南局召开会议，讨论增产节约及超额完成国家计划问题。会议检查了全区工、农业生产，商业、税收等方面完成全年国家计划的情况后，认为当前全区在财政经济工作方面最迫切的任务就是增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支，使以往未完成的计划在今后数月中完成并争取超额完成。会议认为：增加工农业生产，完成国家生产计划，是增加收入的基本方面，而扩大商品流通，则是增加收入，完成税收任务，为工、农业产品打开销路的关键。为此，工矿企业必须加强计划管理，找窍门，挖潜力，开展增产节约竞赛。农业生产方面除大力组织秋收外，在灾区必须发动补种、抢种晚秋作物，扩大土特产收购。商业部门应加强经营管理，加速资金周转，有计划地扩大推销和收购，大力组织物资交流。对于当前积压在几个口岸的货物，必须动员一切交通工具突击运输，加速商品调运。为增加税收，各地应算细账，努力开辟税源，并进行反偷税漏税的斗争。为厉行节约、紧缩开支，会议决定对于各项开支要分清轻重缓急，能不办的就不办，可缓办的就缓办；同时，应严格执行编制计划，减少冗员。此外，并特别强调必须从保存、加工、运输等方面减少粮食损耗，节约粮食。最后，并确定了动员和传达的办法。
    中共重庆市委员会于八日召开全市党员干部增产节约动员大会。会上，市委书记曹荻秋作了“为保证完成与超额完成国家计划而斗争”的报告，曹荻秋具体检查与分析了各企业未完成国家计划的情况与原因，号召全体职工动员起来，开展群众性的增产节约运动。为此，各单位必须深入动员切实制订增产节约计划。工矿企业应加强计划管理，开展增产节约竞赛。商业部门则应积极扩大商品流转，满足人民需要。同时，在税收中要克服干部保守思想，扩大税源，结合反偷税漏税斗争，争取超额完成税收任务。曹荻秋最后说：只要我们能充分发动群众，贯彻党的政策、抓住关键、发掘潜力，努力增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支，我们一定能超额完成国家计划。
