Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister of our country, and Li Dongjian, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent successive replies to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on September 13th and 14th, putting forward the reasonable suggestion that the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly should take steps as soon as possible to expand the membership of the political conference. Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky wrote to the President of the United Nations General Assembly on the 18th, requesting that the "Secretary-General's Memorandum on the Implementation of Resolution No. 3 Adopted by the General Assembly on August 28, 1953" be included in the agenda of the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the proposal of China and North Korea on expanding the political conference.

The proposal of China and North Korea has been met with sympathy from all governments and public opinion that wish and support the successful holding of the political conference after the Korean armistice.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in an important speech on September 17th, accurately pointed out: "The real question now is whether neutral countries should participate in this conference. Our opinion is that it would be beneficial if such countries participated, because they are sometimes able to reconcile differences and ease tensions." He also said that the Korean issue is an Asian issue, and "Asian countries do not want to be ignored; do not want to be left aside..."

Mrs. Pandit, head of the Indian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, also commented on Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's reply to the UN Secretary-General, saying: "A round table conference provides a greater possibility of reaching mutual understanding than any other method."

Indonesian Foreign Minister Sunarjo also said that Indonesia believes that the Korean political conference should adopt the form of a round table conference.

It should also be noted the legitimate opinions and demands reflected in the public opinion of many countries. For example, the British "Times" also stated in its editorial on the 15th that "the Korean dispute contains many problems that cannot be solved solely by the belligerent parties." "The legitimate nature of the United Nations is that of a world organization and a peacemaker, and it must avoid being forced to play the role of an alliance of belligerent countries as much as possible."

However, the United States is violating the will of the majority of the United Nations member states and is stepping up behind-the-scenes activities, arrogantly attempting to prevent the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly from discussing the reasonable proposals of China and North Korea. On September 13th, Murphy, the US Assistant Secretary of State in charge of United Nations affairs, hastily made an absurd speech regarding Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal. On September 17th, Dulles, in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, even falsely accused China and North Korea of "adopting delaying tactics" on the political conference. People want to ask, what justifiable reasons can they produce? They cannot produce any such reasons. Dulles, Murphy, and their ilk can only adopt a rude and unreasonable attitude to oppose the Eighth UN General Assembly's discussion of the issue of expanding the membership of the political conference.

Murphy arbitrarily said that the United Nations has already chosen the members of "its side," and therefore he "sees no reason to put this issue on the agenda of this General Assembly meeting again." He also said: The United States' claim that the political conference is a conference between the two belligerent parties must be adhered to (Reuters). Dulles said that the United States, in accordance with the resolution of the Seventh General Assembly, has made specific proposals regarding the time and place of the political conference on behalf of the "United Nations side." It seems that all the problems have been solved. However, Dulles does not consider the simple fact that the issue of the membership of the political conference cannot be decided by one party alone, but should be resolved through joint consultation between the two parties.

The obvious fact now is that the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" adopted by the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly does not express the true will of the majority of the United Nations member states, but was adopted under the pressure of the United States. The representatives of Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and other countries that proposed the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" stated at the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly that the political conference should be conducted in the form of a round table conference and should not become a conference between two opposing camps. These countries' representatives not only put forward this claim verbally but also took corresponding actions. For example, the representatives of Australia and New Zealand put forward a supplementary proposal suggesting inviting the Soviet Union to participate in the political conference; the four Commonwealth countries also put forward a supplementary proposal suggesting inviting India to participate. Looking at these two proposals together, it is very clear that they advocated inviting relevant neutral countries other than the two sides of the Korean armistice to participate in the political conference, instead of insisting on the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" that is, in fact, the United States' proposal regarding the political conference being limited to the armistice parties.

Furthermore, what kind of reaction did these two proposals receive at the Seventh General Assembly? The proposal to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the political conference was unanimously passed by almost all member states; and the proposal to invite India to participate in the political conference was also passed by a majority in the Seventh General Assembly's Political Committee. Although some countries that originally agreed to India's participation in the political conference, under the strong pressure of the United States, did not vote in favor of India's participation in the political conference when voting, as they had originally expressed, they never expressed their approval of the United States' opinion, but abstained. The countries that agreed with the United States' unreasonable claim to refuse India's participation in the political conference were only seventeen Latin American countries and the United States' two puppets, Greece and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang representative.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out in his speech on September 17th: The vote yielded some interesting results. "Twenty-one votes were against India, of which eighteen were cast by the Americas, and seventeen out of the eighteen were cast by the so-called Latin America. I have great respect for the Latin American countries. There is no doubt about that. But the fact shows: when almost all European countries and almost all Asian countries need something in the political conference, many countries in the entire American continent do not want this thing. Of course, they have the full right not to want this thing, just as they have the full right to want this thing. However, what we are considering is the Asian issue, the issue of Asia. Can the will of Asia be despised because some people who have nothing to do with this issue are indeed not as concerned as the Asians, can the combined will of Asia and Europe be despised? This is a very special situation."

The Fifteen-Nation Proposal adopted by the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which refused to consider the principled proposals of China and North Korea and did not conform to the principles of the United Nations and the true will of the majority of member states, is a fact known to the world. For this fact, the reactionary forces of the United States, such as Dulles and Murphy, cannot deny or overturn it even with the most eloquent of tongues. In any case, now, Dulles, Murphy, and their ilk still cannot say that the United Nations agrees with the United States' "must adhere to" "the claim that the political conference is a conference between the two belligerent parties." On the contrary, this fact only proves that the Eighth Session of the United Nations should fully discuss the issue of expanding the membership of the political conference.

Why has this unreasonable claim of the United States been strongly opposed by the Seventh General Assembly and world public opinion, creating a situation in which it admits it is unprecedentedly isolated? This is because the sinister purpose hidden behind the United States' unreasonable claim, that is, the heads of the US reactionary clique have openly announced their willingness to withdraw from the political conference with the Lee Seung-man clique in ninety days, and then sabotage the armistice and expand the evil plan of the war, runs counter to the goal of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and further consolidating the peace and security of the Far East and all countries in the world, and conflicts with the interests of the peace and security of all countries, especially the Far East.

The British "Yorkshire Post" has repeatedly stated that there is "a great divergence of views" between Britain and the United States. The newspaper said: "We are convinced that the obvious factual issue is: the time has come to convene a round table conference to prepare for a broader solution."

On September 13th, British Labour Party leader Attlee also cried out loudly against the United States' coercion of other countries invading Korea to issue a "Sixteen-Nation Declaration" on the possible expansion of the Korean War: "I feel it is my duty to express some anxiety about American policy." He also said, "I think it is most regrettable that India is opposed to participating in the political conference."

However, the reactionary ruling clique of the United States, precisely because it saw that its sinister purpose of preparing to realize the conspiracy with the Lee Seung-man clique to sabotage the political conference and carry out new adventures, might be declared bankrupt due to the opposition of various countries; therefore, it tried its best to oppose the political conference adopting the form of a round table conference, and insisted on turning the political conference into the second Panmunjom negotiations, in order to exclude countries concerned with and supporting the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, especially the Soviet Union and other relevant countries in Asia.

Murphy openly believed that if the United Nations General Assembly considered expanding the membership of the political conference, it would be a harmful "interference." He categorically issued orders saying: "The overly enthusiastic criticism of non-participants should not complicate its (the political conference) work." Murphy also openly advocated that the participants of the political conference should have "a certain degree of freedom," and that the Lee Seung-man clique should have "a certain degree of freedom" "in particular." According to the explanation of the United Press, Murphy was afraid that the past angry criticisms of Lee Seung-man's calls for "unification by force" to sabotage the armistice by various countries would be detrimental to the future work of the United States and Lee Seung-man to sabotage the political conference.

This confirms some keen "impressions" of the United States' "allies." "New York Post" reporter Lash reported that: "Some of our allies have the impression that the United States is not eager to discuss its claims on the issue of Korean unification, because the United States wants to go its own way in the political conference, just as it did in the recent United Nations General Assembly; reliable diplomatic sources said that the United States not only hopes to exclude India from the political conference, but even tries to use a method to prevent Britain, France, and other countries that supply troops to the Unified Command from having a real say in this conference."

Similarly keen "impressions" can also be found in the public opinion of many countries. For example, the Swedish "Morning Post" commented: Public opinion in Britain, France, Canada, and many other countries believes that the United Nations should organize a round table conference in order to reach an agreement on the Korean issue and the general Far East issues related to it. The participation of some countries that did not participate in the war can help reach an agreement. But it is very obvious that the United States holds a completely different view on this issue. The United States believes that the task of the United Nations is only to support the views of the United States and give the United States the right to contact the other party to solve all problems.

The reactionary ruling clique of the United States cannot, of course, turn a deaf ear to the voices of world public opinion against the unreasonable claims of the United States. In order to suppress this voice, the reactionary ruling clique of the United States, in addition to exerting blatant pressure on its partners, also uses various despicable tricks. For example, Dulles once hypocritically stated: The United States is prepared to convene a "second stage" conference after the political conference to discuss the so-called broader issues of the Far East, at which time non-Korean War belligerents can all participate. This is a trick to cover up their conspiracy to sabotage the political conference and to perfunctorily deal with the reasonable demands of various countries to expand the membership of the political conference. This is also like the Chinese saying of inviting them to eat "empty dumplings."

Now, this trick has been used again. United Press reporter Olson reported the opinions of Washington's "well-informed sources" saying: "Secretary of State Dulles has hinted that once the Korean conference is likely to continue discussing broader issues in the current Far East after discussing the issue of Korea's political status, then the United States is willing to expand the member states participating in the conference. From the perspective of the United States' position, the countries that the common party suggested to participate in the conference today are not unacceptable in the 'second stage' of the conference."

However, this is a very shameful deception and is another manifestation of the United States' hegemony. Can the conference discussing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and other Far East issues be arranged by Dulles and his ilk at will? Can the United States decide who should not participate or when to participate in the discussion of these issues that are obviously closely related to the interests of peace and security in the Far East?

It can be seen from this that the essence of the problem facing the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly today is very clear. The Korean issue will still be a test of the foreign policy of various countries.

Now the will of the people of the world is: to expand the membership of the political conference and invite neutral countries to participate in order to help the successful completion of the political conference's tasks. No one can doubt this now.

    扩大政治会议的成员是合理的和必要的
    胡思升
    我国周恩来外长和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国李东建副外相于九月十三日和十四日先后致联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的覆函，提出了联合国第八届大会应尽速采取步骤来扩大政治会议的成员的合理建议。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基于十八日写信给联合国大会主席，要求把“秘书长关于一九五三年八月二十八日大会通过的第三项决议案的执行情况的备忘录”列入第八届联合国大会的议程，以讨论中朝两国关于扩大政治会议的建议。
    中朝两国的建议，得到了一切愿望和支持朝鲜停战后开好政治会议的各国政府和公众舆论的同情。
    印度总理尼赫鲁先生在九月十七日发表的重要演说，确切地指出：“目前真正的问题是，是否应当有中立国参加这个会议。我们的意见是，如果有这类国家参加是有益于事的，就是因为它们有时能够调和分歧与缓和紧张情势。”他又说，朝鲜问题是亚洲问题，“亚洲各国不愿被忽视；不愿被撇在一边……”
    印度出席联合国大会的代表团团长潘迪特夫人就周恩来外长致联合国秘书长的复电也发表评论说：“圆桌会议比其他任何方式都更能提供较大的达到互相谅解的可能性。”
    印尼外交部长苏纳约也说，印度尼西亚认为，朝鲜政治会议应当采用圆桌会议的方式。
    还应当注意到许多国家公众舆论所反映的正当意见和要求。譬如，英国“泰晤士报”在十五日的社论中也说：“朝鲜争端包含着许多问题，是不可能单单由交战国双方加以解决的。”“联合国的正当性质是一种世界性质和缔造和平的性质，它必须尽量避免被迫担任一种交战国联盟的角色。”
    但是，美国却违反联合国多数会员国的意志，正在加紧幕后活动，专横地企图阻止第八届联合国大会讨论中朝两国的合理建议。九月十三日美国负责联合国事务的助理国务卿墨菲情急地对我国周恩来外长的建议发表荒谬演说。九月十七日，杜勒斯在联合国大会上演说时竟又诬蔑朝中两国对政治会议“采取拖延策略”。人们要问，究竟他们能够拿出什么站得住脚的理由来呢？他们是拿不出任何这样的理由来的。杜勒斯、墨菲之流只能采取蛮横无理的态度来反对八届联大讨论扩大政治会议的成员问题。
    墨菲武断地说联合国已经选择了它的“一方”的成员，因而他“认为没有任何理由把这个问题再放在这次联大会议中讨论”。他又说：美国关于政治会议是交战两方之间的会议的主张，是必须坚持的（路透社电）。杜勒斯说美国已遵照七届联大的决议代表“联合国一方”提出关于政治会议的具体时间和地点的建议。好像一切问题都已解决了。然而杜勒斯却毫不考虑到这样一个简单的事实：政治会议的成员问题不能由一方单独作出决定，而应该由双方共同协商才能够解决的。
    现在的明显的事实是：联合国第七届大会通过的“十五国提案”，是并不能表达联合国多数会员国的真正意志的，是在美国的压力下通过的。“十五国提案”的提案人英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、加拿大等国的代表在第七届联合国大会上的发言，都主张应以圆桌会议的形式进行政治会议，不要成为两个相对而坐的敌对阵营的会议。这些国家的代表不仅在口头上提出这个主张，而且采取了相应的行动。譬如澳大利亚和新西兰代表提出了一个补充提案，建议邀请苏联参加政治会议；英联邦四个国家也提出了一个补充提案，建议邀请印度参加。把这两个提案合在一起来看，就很清楚地表明，他们是主张邀请朝鲜停战双方以外的有关中立国家参加政治会议的，而不是坚持事实上是美国的提案的“十五国提案”关于政治会议应限于停战双方的规定的。
    再说，这两个提案又在七届联大中得到了怎样的反应呢？邀请苏联参加政治会议的提案得到几乎全部会员国的一致通过；而邀请印度参加政治会议的提案，也在七届联大政治委员会上得到多数通过。原来赞同印度参加政治会议的某些国家，虽然在美国强力的压迫下，在投票时没有像它们原先所表示的对印度参加政治会议问题投赞成票，但是它们也绝没有表示赞同美国的意见，而是弃权。赞同美国拒绝印度参加政治会议的无理主张的国家，不过是十七个拉丁美洲国家和美国的两个傀儡希腊及蒋匪帮代表而已。
    印度总理尼赫鲁在九月十七日的演说中指出：这次表决得出了某些有趣的结果。“有二十一票反对印度，其中十八票是美洲投的票，而十八票中有十七票是所谓拉丁美洲投的票。我是很尊重拉丁美洲的国家的。这是毫无疑问的。但是事实表明：当几乎所有的欧洲国家和几乎所有的亚洲国家都需要政治会议中有一种东西时，而整个美洲的许多国家却不要这种东西。固然它们有充分的权利不要这种东西，正如他们也有充分的权利要这种东西一样。但是，我们所考虑的是亚洲问题，是亚洲的问题。由于某些对这一问题没有什么关系的人的确不像亚洲人那样关切，是不是亚洲的意志就可以被藐视呢，是不是亚洲和欧洲的联合意志可以被藐视呢？这是一个非常特殊的情况。”
    联合国第七届大会通过的十五国提案，既拒不考虑中朝两国的原则建议，也不符联合国的原则和多数会员国的真正意志，这是举世所共知的事实。对于这个事实，美国反动势力如杜勒斯、墨菲之流即使有三寸不烂之舌也不能加以抹煞和推翻。无论如何，现在，杜勒斯、墨菲之流也依然不能说联合国是赞同美国“必须坚持”“关于政治会议是交战两方之间的会议的主张”的。相反地，这种事实只是证明联合国八届大会完全应该讨论扩大政治会议的成员问题。
    为什么美国的这个无理主张会在七届联大和世界舆论面前受到强烈的反对，造成连它自己也承认陷于空前孤立的境地呢？这是因为美国隐藏在它的无理主张后面的阴谋目的，即美国反动集团的首脑业已公开宣布它准备与李承晚集团在九十天后退出政治会议，然后破坏停战，扩大战争的罪恶计划，与和平解决朝鲜问题、进一步巩固远东和世界各国和平与安全的目标背道而驰，与各国特别是与远东各国的和平与安全的利益相冲突。
    英国“约克郡邮报”一再说明英国和美国之间“见解上的分歧很大”，该报说：“我们深信，明显的事实问题是：召开一个圆桌会议来准备作更广泛的解决，现在是时候了。”
    九月十三日，英国工党领袖艾德礼也对美国胁迫其他侵朝国家发表关于可能扩大朝鲜战争的“十六国宣言”，大声疾呼地说：“我觉得我有责任对美国政策表示某种焦虑”。他并表示“我认为最可遗憾的是，竟反对印度参加政治会议。”
    但是，美国反动统治集团正是因为看到它准备实现和李承晚集团一起破坏政治会议，进行新的冒险的阴谋目的，有可能因各国的反对而宣告破产；所以，它便竭力反对政治会议采取圆桌会议的形式，而坚持要把政治会议变为板门店谈判第二，以便排除关心并支持和平解决朝鲜问题的各国特别是苏联和亚洲其他有关国家参加。
    墨菲公然认为联合国大会如果考虑扩大政治会议的成员，那就是一种有害的“干预”。他断然发号施令说：“不应让非参加者的过分热烈的批评使它（政治会议）的工作复杂化。”墨菲并公然主张政治会议的参加者应有“一定的自由”，“特别”应当使李承晚集团有“一定的自由”。据合众社的解释，墨菲是害怕过去各国对李承晚破坏停战叫嚣“武力统一”的行动的愤怒批评，会对今后美国和李承晚破坏政治会议的工作不利。
    这就证实了美国的“盟国”的锐敏的一些“印象”。“纽约邮报”记者拉希曾报道说：“我们的一些盟国有这种印象，即美国并不急于要讨论它对朝鲜统一问题的主张，因为美国想照着它在最近联合国大会上的做法，在政治会议上独行其是；可靠的外交界人士说，美国不仅希望把印度排斥在政治会议之外，甚至还试图运用一种办法，使英、法和其他供应军队给统一司令部的各国在这次会议上没有真正的发言权。”
    同样锐敏的“印象”，也在许多国家的舆论中可以找到。例如瑞典“晨报”评述：英国、法国、加拿大和其他许多国家的舆论都认为，联合国应该组织一个圆桌会议，以便朝鲜问题和与之有关的一般远东问题达成协议。某些没有参加战争的国家参加会议可以有助于达成协议。但十分明显的是，美国在这个问题上所持的看法是完全不同的。美国认为，联合国的任务只是支持美国的观点，给美国以权利去与对方接触来解决所有问题。
    美国反动统治集团对于世界各国舆论反对美国无理主张的声浪，当然不能充耳无闻。为了压制这种声浪，美国反动统治集团除了对它的伙伴们施行露骨的压力以外，还使用各种卑劣的诡计。譬如，杜勒斯就曾假惺惺地声言：美国准备在政治会议之后召开“第二阶段”的会议，以讨论所谓广泛的远东问题，那时非朝鲜战争交战国就都可以参加。这就是一条诡计，用以掩盖它们破坏政治会议的阴谋，并搪塞各国要求扩大政治会议的成员的合理主张。这也就是像中国俗话所说的请它们吃“空心汤团”。
    现在，这个诡计又使出来了。合众社记者奥尔逊报道华盛顿的“消息灵通人士”的意见说：“国务卿杜勒斯已经暗示过，一旦朝鲜会议有可能在讨论朝鲜政治地位问题之后继行讨论当前远东较为广泛的问题，那么美国愿意把参加会议的成员国加以扩大。照美国的立场来看，共方今天建议参加的国家在会议的‘第二阶段’中并不是不可接受的。”
    然而，这是非常可耻的欺骗，而且是美国横行霸道的又一表现。难道讨论和平解决朝鲜问题及其他远东问题的会议，能听凭杜勒斯之流的喜欢来一手安排的吗？难道讨论这些显然密切关系到远东各国和平与安全的利益的问题，可以让美国来决定谁不应该参加或在什么时候参加的吗？
    由此可见，今天摆在联合国第八届大会面前的这个问题的实质，是再明显不过了，朝鲜问题仍将是对各国外交政策的一个考验。
    现在全世界人民的意志是：扩大政治会议的成员，邀请中立国家参加，以便有助于政治会议任务的圆满达成。这一点现在任何人都不能加以怀疑了。
