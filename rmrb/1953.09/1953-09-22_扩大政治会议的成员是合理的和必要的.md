Title: Expanding the Membership of the Political Conference is Reasonable and Necessary

Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister of our country, and Li Dongjian, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent successive replies to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskj√∂ld on September 13th and 14th, putting forward the reasonable suggestion that the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly should take steps as soon as possible to expand the membership of the political conference. Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky wrote to the President of the United Nations General Assembly on the 18th, requesting that the "Secretary-General's Memorandum on the Implementation of Resolution No. 3 Adopted by the General Assembly on August 28, 1953" be included in the agenda of the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the proposal of China and North Korea on expanding the political conference.

The proposal of China and North Korea has been met with sympathy from all governments and public opinion that wish and support the successful holding of the political conference after the Korean armistice.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in an important speech on September 17th, accurately pointed out: "The real question now is whether neutral countries should participate in this conference. Our opinion is that it would be beneficial if such countries participated, because they are sometimes able to reconcile differences and ease tensions." He also said that the Korean issue is an Asian issue, and "Asian countries do not want to be ignored; do not want to be left aside..."

Mrs. Pandit, head of the Indian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, also commented on Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's reply to the UN Secretary-General, saying: "A round table conference provides a greater possibility of reaching mutual understanding than any other method."

Indonesian Foreign Minister Sunarjo also said that Indonesia believes that the Korean political conference should adopt the form of a round table conference.

It should also be noted the legitimate opinions and demands reflected in the public opinion of many countries. For example, the British "Times" also stated in its editorial on the 15th that "the Korean dispute contains many problems that cannot be solved solely by the belligerent parties." "The legitimate nature of the United Nations is that of a world organization and a peacemaker, and it must avoid being forced to play the role of an alliance of belligerent countries as much as possible."

However, the United States is violating the will of the majority of the United Nations member states and is stepping up behind-the-scenes activities, arrogantly attempting to prevent the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly from discussing the reasonable proposals of China and North Korea. On September 13th, Murphy, the US Assistant Secretary of State in charge of United Nations affairs, hastily made an absurd speech regarding Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal. On September 17th, Dulles, in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, even falsely accused China and North Korea of "adopting delaying tactics" on the political conference. People want to ask, what justifiable reasons can they produce? They cannot produce any such reasons. Dulles, Murphy, and their ilk can only adopt a rude and unreasonable attitude to oppose the Eighth UN General Assembly's discussion of the issue of expanding the membership of the political conference.

Murphy arbitrarily said that the United Nations has already chosen the members of "its side," and therefore he "sees no reason to put this issue on the agenda of this General Assembly meeting again." He also said: The United States' claim that the political conference is a conference between the two belligerent parties must be adhered to (Reuters). Dulles said that the United States, in accordance with the resolution of the Seventh General Assembly, has made specific proposals regarding the time and place of the political conference on behalf of the "United Nations side." It seems that all the problems have been solved. However, Dulles does not consider the simple fact that the issue of the membership of the political conference cannot be decided by one party alone, but should be resolved through joint consultation between the two parties.

The obvious fact now is that the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" adopted by the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly does not express the true will of the majority of the United Nations member states, but was adopted under the pressure of the United States. The representatives of Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and other countries that proposed the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" stated at the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly that the political conference should be conducted in the form of a round table conference and should not become a conference between two opposing camps. These countries' representatives not only put forward this claim verbally but also took corresponding actions. For example, the representatives of Australia and New Zealand put forward a supplementary proposal suggesting inviting the Soviet Union to participate in the political conference; the four Commonwealth countries also put forward a supplementary proposal suggesting inviting India to participate. Looking at these two proposals together, it is very clear that they advocated inviting relevant neutral countries other than the two sides of the Korean armistice to participate in the political conference, instead of insisting on the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" that is, in fact, the United States' proposal regarding the political conference being limited to the armistice parties.

Furthermore, what kind of reaction did these two proposals receive at the Seventh General Assembly? The proposal to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the political conference was unanimously passed by almost all member states; and the proposal to invite India to participate in the political conference was also passed by a majority in the Seventh General Assembly's Political Committee. Although some countries that originally agreed to India's participation in the political conference, under the strong pressure of the United States, did not vote in favor of India's participation in the political conference when voting, as they had originally expressed, they never expressed their approval of the United States' opinion, but abstained. The countries that agreed with the United States' unreasonable claim to refuse India's participation in the political conference were only seventeen Latin American countries and the United States' two puppets, Greece and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang representative.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out in his speech on September 17th: The vote yielded some interesting results. "Twenty-one votes were against India, of which eighteen were cast by the Americas, and seventeen out of the eighteen were cast by the so-called Latin America. I have great respect for the Latin American countries. There is no doubt about that. But the fact shows: when almost all European countries and almost all Asian countries need something in the political conference, many countries in the entire American continent do not want this thing. Of course, they have the full right not to want this thing, just as they have the full right to want this thing. However, what we are considering is the Asian issue, the issue of Asia. Can the will of Asia be despised because some people who have nothing to do with this issue are indeed not as concerned as the Asians, can the combined will of Asia and Europe be despised? This is a very special situation."

The Fifteen-Nation Proposal adopted by the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which refused to consider the principled proposals of China and North Korea and did not conform to the principles of the United Nations and the true will of the majority of member states, is a fact known to the world. For this fact, the reactionary forces of the United States, such as Dulles and Murphy, cannot deny or overturn it even with the most eloquent of tongues. In any case, now, Dulles, Murphy, and their ilk still cannot say that the United Nations agrees with the United States' "must adhere to" "the claim that the political conference is a conference between the two belligerent parties." On the contrary, this fact only proves that the Eighth Session of the United Nations should fully discuss the issue of expanding the membership of the political conference.

Why has this unreasonable claim of the United States been strongly opposed by the Seventh General Assembly and world public opinion, creating a situation in which it admits it is unprecedentedly isolated? This is because the sinister purpose hidden behind the United States' unreasonable claim, that is, the heads of the US reactionary clique have openly announced their willingness to withdraw from the political conference with the Lee Seung-man clique in ninety days, and then sabotage the armistice and expand the evil plan of the war, runs counter to the goal of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and further consolidating the peace and security of the Far East and all countries in the world, and conflicts with the interests of the peace and security of all countries, especially the Far East.

The British "Yorkshire Post" has repeatedly stated that there is "a great divergence of views" between Britain and the United States. The newspaper said: "We are convinced that the obvious factual issue is: the time has come to convene a round table conference to prepare for a broader solution."

On September 13th, British Labour Party leader Attlee also cried out loudly against the United States' coercion of other countries invading Korea to issue a "Sixteen-Nation Declaration" on the possible expansion of the Korean War: "I feel it is my duty to express some anxiety about American policy." He also said, "I think it is most regrettable that India is opposed to participating in the political conference."

However, the reactionary ruling clique of the United States, precisely because it saw that its sinister purpose of preparing to realize the conspiracy with the Lee Seung-man clique to sabotage the political conference and carry out new adventures, might be declared bankrupt due to the opposition of various countries; therefore, it tried its best to oppose the political conference adopting the form of a round table conference, and insisted on turning the political conference into the second Panmunjom negotiations, in order to exclude countries concerned with and supporting the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, especially the Soviet Union and other relevant countries in Asia.

Murphy openly believed that if the United Nations General Assembly considered expanding the membership of the political conference, it would be a harmful "interference." He categorically issued orders saying: "The overly enthusiastic criticism of non-participants should not complicate its (the political conference) work." Murphy also openly advocated that the participants of the political conference should have "a certain degree of freedom," and that the Lee Seung-man clique should have "a certain degree of freedom" "in particular." According to the explanation of the United Press, Murphy was afraid that the past angry criticisms of Lee Seung-man's calls for "unification by force" to sabotage the armistice by various countries would be detrimental to the future work of the United States and Lee Seung-man to sabotage the political conference.

This confirms some keen "impressions" of the United States' "allies." "New York Post" reporter Lash reported that: "Some of our allies have the impression that the United States is not eager to discuss its claims on the issue of Korean unification, because the United States wants to go its own way in the political conference, just as it did in the recent United Nations General Assembly; reliable diplomatic sources said that the United States not only hopes to exclude India from the political conference, but even tries to use a method to prevent Britain, France, and other countries that supply troops to the Unified Command from having a real say in this conference."

Similarly keen "impressions" can also be found in the public opinion of many countries. For example, the Swedish "Morning Post" commented: Public opinion in Britain, France, Canada, and many other countries believes that the United Nations should organize a round table conference in order to reach an agreement on the Korean issue and the general Far East issues related to it. The participation of some countries that did not participate in the war can help reach an agreement. But it is very obvious that the United States holds a completely different view on this issue. The United States believes that the task of the United Nations is only to support the views of the United States and give the United States the right to contact the other party to solve all problems.

The reactionary ruling clique of the United States cannot, of course, turn a deaf ear to the voices of world public opinion against the unreasonable claims of the United States. In order to suppress this voice, the reactionary ruling clique of the United States, in addition to exerting blatant pressure on its partners, also uses various despicable tricks. For example, Dulles once hypocritically stated: The United States is prepared to convene a "second stage" conference after the political conference to discuss the so-called broader issues of the Far East, at which time non-Korean War belligerents can all participate. This is a trick to cover up their conspiracy to sabotage the political conference and to perfunctorily deal with the reasonable demands of various countries to expand the membership of the political conference. This is also like the Chinese saying of inviting them to eat "empty dumplings."

Now, this trick has been used again. United Press reporter Olson reported the opinions of Washington's "well-informed sources" saying: "Secretary of State Dulles has hinted that once the Korean conference is likely to continue discussing broader issues in the current Far East after discussing the issue of Korea's political status, then the United States is willing to expand the member states participating in the conference. From the perspective of the United States' position, the countries that the common party suggested to participate in the conference today are not unacceptable in the 'second stage' of the conference."

However, this is a very shameful deception and is another manifestation of the United States' hegemony. Can the conference discussing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and other Far East issues be arranged by Dulles and his ilk at will? Can the United States decide who should not participate or when to participate in the discussion of these issues that are obviously closely related to the interests of peace and security in the Far East?

It can be seen from this that the essence of the problem facing the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly today is very clear. The Korean issue will still be a test of the foreign policy of various countries.

Now the will of the people of the world is: to expand the membership of the political conference and invite neutral countries to participate in order to help the successful completion of the political conference's tasks. No one can doubt this now.
