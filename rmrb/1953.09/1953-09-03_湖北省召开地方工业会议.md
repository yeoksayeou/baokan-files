    Hubei Province Holds Local Industry Conference
    The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened its first special (city) and county local industry conference in July. The conference summarized the rectification work of local industries in special districts and counties during the first half of the year, and focused on studying how local industries can implement the policy of serving agricultural production and the lives of urban and rural people, and how to rely on workers to give full play to the enthusiasm of all workers and staff to improve production.
    Over the past few years, local industries in special districts and counties have made considerable achievements in production and construction. However, because most local industries were taken over from the original agency production, the policy of serving agricultural production was not clear enough in the construction process, and there was a lack of research on the overall situation of production, supply, and sales. This has caused some blindness in development and production, bringing many difficulties to local industries. For example, some counties built brick and tile factories, but rarely produced after completion. Some towns, based only on temporary needs or purely from a profit-making perspective, massively developed rice mills without considering long-term supply relationships, resulting in excessive installations and oversupply, causing great difficulties in operation. Some farm implement factories did not base their production on the needs of local farmers and did not pay attention to product quality. The farm implements produced did not meet the specifications needed by local farmers, resulting in a large backlog of products, financial exhaustion, and inability to maintain production. In addition, some farm implement factories blindly manufactured new-style improved farm implements, which could not be promoted locally. Furthermore, the leadership structures of general factories and mines were large, with too many non-production personnel. After the rectification in the first half of the year, the blind development of the above problems has been basically stopped. Most factories have improved quality and increased production. After rectification, farm implement factories in various places corrected the previous bias of only making new-style farm implements and being unwilling to make old farm implements that the masses were accustomed to. They turned to producing old-style farm implements as the main focus, and steadily trial-produced new farm implements. For example, blacksmiths from the Ebei Machinery Factory dispersed to the countryside to make farm implements according to the needs and styles of local farmers, which was well received by the farmers. Workers in the plow casting group of the Tongcheng Farm Implement Factory used their brains to find ways to enlarge and deepen the bottom of the furnace, increasing the output per furnace from 180 to 300, while ensuring product quality. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the Xinzhou Enterprise Company conducted repeated research on the situation and existing problems of various factories in the county, and began to carry out a rectification of organizational structure and leadership methods. It clarified the production direction of "determining production by sales, using local materials, producing and selling locally, and serving the needs of urban and rural people," and fully invested in production under the slogan of "increasing output, reducing costs, and improving quality." So far, it has achieved considerable results. Taking the oil pressing factory as an example, the factory's productivity increased by 28.8 percent, the oil yield increased by 3.12 percent, and the cost decreased by 10.64 percent. After rectification and changing its management methods, the Hanyang Yimin Power Plant reversed the serious situation of long-term losses, and now has a surplus of 9 million yuan per month. The Qianjiang Printing Factory also saw a great improvement in business after changing its business style of waiting for customers to come to the door. Other factories such as the Yunmeng Oil and Power Plant, the Shishou People's Rice and Power Plant, and the Yichang and Shayang printing factories have also improved after rectification.
    However, the rectification work of local industries in special districts and counties in the first half of the year also had serious shortcomings. The policy of local industries serving rural production was not clear enough, and the focus was more on negative aspects, emphasizing "closing, merging, consolidating, and shrinking." The emphasis on staffing and quotas was excessive and not based on the conditions and characteristics of local industries. Therefore, it formed a purely organizational rectification, with overly high demands, and a lack of ways to find solutions from production, resulting in too much "closing and shrinking," causing difficulties in dealing with the transfer of workers. The conference fully discussed and studied the characteristics of local industries, and believed that although local industries in special districts and counties are small and scattered, they belong to local state-owned enterprises and are part of the socialist economy. They supplement the insufficient production of large state-owned industries, undertake the task of accumulating funds for national construction, and at the same time have close ties with agricultural production, supplying part of the production and living materials for farmers. Therefore, local industries will inevitably continue to improve with the development of the vast agricultural economy. Due to its connection with the rural economy, it has regional, decentralized, seasonal, and handicraft production characteristics, which stipulate that the construction and production management policies of local industries in special districts and counties must clearly serve local agricultural production and the lives of farmers, and develop the local economy. Different tasks and requirements must be put forward according to different regions, adapting to local conditions, carefully considering the needs of local people and current possibilities, preventing blind production, overcoming the ideas of being divorced from reality, being greedy, liking the new and disliking the old, and being fond of the grandiose and eager for success. It is also necessary to oppose shoddy manufacturing, oppose capitalist management styles and purely profit-making perspectives, and oppose the supply system mentality. The conference believed that to implement the policy of local industries in special districts and counties serving rural production, it is necessary to do a good job in production with all our strength. It is necessary to mobilize and rely on all workers, continuously strengthen political and ideological education among workers, gradually improve the level of enterprise management, improve product quality, and reduce costs.
    After the closing of the conference, Xiaogan and Huanggang special districts have held meetings to convey the spirit, and the remaining special districts are also holding meetings or actively preparing to convene meetings to implement the spirit of the conference. (Fan Kun)

    湖北省召开地方工业会议
    中共湖北省委在七月间召开首次专（市）县地方工业会议，总结了上半年专、县地方工业的整顿工作，着重研究了地方工业如何贯彻为农业生产和为城乡人民生活服务的方针，如何依靠工人，发挥全体工人职员的积极性以搞好生产。
    专、县地方工业，这几年来在生产和建设上，都取得不少的成绩，但由于地方工业大部分是从原来的机关生产接办的，在建设的过程中，为农业生产服务的方针不够明确和缺乏对产供销全面情况的研究，因而造成在发展和生产上的若干盲目性，给地方工业带来了不少的困难。如像有些县建设的砖瓦厂，建成后即很少进行生产；有些城镇只从一时的需要，或单从营利观点出发，就大量发展碾米厂，没有考虑到长期的供应关系，因而设置过大，供过于求，给经营上造成很大困难；有些农具厂不根据当地农民需要，不注意产品质量，生产出的农具，不合当地农民需用的规格，造成产品大量积压，资金枯竭，无法维持；另有些农具厂，盲目制造新式改良农具，在当地无法推广。另外一般厂矿领导机构庞大，非生产人员过多。上面这些问题，经过上半年的整顿，基本上制止了盲目发展。大多数工厂改进了品质，提高了生产。各地农具厂经过整顿后，纠正了以往只做新式农具，不愿做群众已惯用了的旧农具的偏向，转向以生产旧式农具为主，稳步试制新农具。如鄂北机械厂打铁工人分散下乡，根据当地农民需要和农具式样打制农具，颇得农民好评。通城农具厂铸犁组工人，动脑筋想办法，把炉底改大、改深以后，每炉产量由一百八十个提高到三百个，并且还保证了产品质量。新洲企业公司，在党委领导下，对该县各厂情况和存在问题进行了反复研究，着手从组织机构和领导方法上进行了
    一次整顿，明确了“以销定产、就地取材、就地产销，为城乡人民需要服务”的生产方向，在“增加产量、降低成本、提高品质”的口号下，全力投入生产。到目前为止，已取得不少成绩。以榨油厂为例，该厂生产率提高了百分之二十八点八，出油率提高了百分之三点一二，成本降低了百分之十点六四。汉阳益民电厂经过整顿，改变了经营方式后，扭转了长期亏本的严重情况，每月尚可盈余九百万元。潜江印刷厂改变了等客上门的经营作风后，营业也大有起色。其他如云梦油电厂、石首人民电米厂、宜昌、沙洋两地印刷厂等经过整顿后，都有了改进。
    但上半年专、县地方工业的整顿工作，也存在较严重的缺点，表现在贯彻地方工业为农村生产服务，从搞好生产，打开销路，来实现整顿工作的方针不够明确，从消极方面出发的多，强调“关并统缩”，不根据地方工业的条件特点，过分强调定员定额。因此形成单纯组织整顿，要求又过高，缺乏从生产上想办法，致使“关缩”过多，造成处理工人转业的困难。此次会议充分地讨论、研究了地方工业的特点，认为专、县地方工业虽然小而分散，但是属于地方国营企业，是社会主义经济的一部分。它补助国营大工业的生产不足，担负着为国家建设积累资金的任务，同时它又与农业生产有着密切的联系，供应着农民生产和生活资料的一部分。因此，地方工业必然随着广大的农业经济发展而不断的提高。由于它与农村经济相联系，因而产生了地区性，分散性、季节性和手工业生产方式的特点，并从而规定了专、县地方工业的建设与生产经营方针，必须明确为当地农业生产农民生活服务，和发展当地的经济事业，必须按不同地区提出不同的任务要求，因地制宜，仔细考虑当地人民的需要和目前的可能，防止盲目生产，克服脱离实际的贪多、喜新厌旧和好大喜功的思想，并要反对粗制滥造，反对资本主义的经营作风和单纯营利观点，反对供给制思想，会议认为要贯彻专、县地方工业为农村生产服务的方针，必须要全力搞好生产。必须发动与依靠全体工人，不断的加强在工人中的政治思想教育工作，逐步提高企业管理水平，提高产品质量，降低成本。
    会议闭幕后，孝感、黄冈两专区已经开过会议，进行传达，其余各专区也正在开会或积极准备召开会议，贯彻大会的精神。（凡坤）
