Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 31st: The "Truth Daily" recently published an article written by Chichikina, entitled "The Conspiracy of the United States to Expand the War in Southeast Asia."

The article stated: When people heard the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, they were filled with hope that all disputes in Asia could be resolved and the war in Indochina would also end. However, the ink was barely dry on General Harrison's signature on the Korean Armistice Agreement when aggressive forces began plotting a war against Asia. In this regard, the pronouncements in the reactionary American newspapers regarding the possibility of expanding and intensifying the war in Indochina became particularly blatant.

Chichikina went on to say that not long ago, the United States Department of State published a booklet on the war in Indochina. This booklet unabashedly admits that the United States' military intervention in Indochinese affairs will continue to intensify. Even according to official reports, the monthly average of war materials shipped from the United States to Indochina in the past six months has almost doubled compared to 1952. But this still does not satisfy the American aggressors.

An article published in the "Wall Street Journal" is sufficient to illustrate the American aggressive conspiracy. According to the newspaper, Secretary of State Dulles and his assistants have drawn up a detailed plan to promote the war in Indochina, with the aim of ending the war within eighteen months. The "Wall Street Journal" stated: The crux of this plan is to prepare and launch a large-scale offensive, which French Commander-in-Chief General Navarre intends to launch from October 1953 to April 1954. As for the United States, it guarantees to support the French army with air force, navy, and even ground forces when necessary.

The puppet regimes of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam bear important tasks in the Dulles-Navarre plan. Therefore, people clearly realize why American newspapers have recently been constantly encouraging these regimes and talking about giving Indochina "independence."

Chichikina said: It is very obvious that all this talk about "independence" is just a new conspiracy by the United States, aimed at seizing France's position in Asia, usurping political power in Indochina, and seizing its natural resources. The US President himself openly stated at the annual governors' conference on August 4th that the United States has a direct interest in such a solution to the Indochina issue. He said: "Let us assume that we lose Indochina. If Indochina is finished... the small piece of land left there will be almost indefensible. The tin and tungsten in that area, which are of great value to us, will be unobtainable." He also said: "The whole situation there is very unfavorable to the United States, because in the end, if we lose that place, how can the free world (should be read as the United States) hold onto the rich empire (?) of Indonesia?" Chichikina emphasized that what the so-called "free world" is interested in is only tin, tungsten, and rubber. In other words, it is the wealth of Indochina, Indonesia, and Burma. And the representative of the so-called free world is none other than the American capital that is trying to arbitrarily exploit the Southeast Asian countries.

The author concluded by writing: Everything shows that the United States is not interested in establishing lasting peace in Asia.

    揭发美国准备在东南亚扩大战争的阴谋
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三十一日讯：“真理报”最近刊载了契奇金纳写的一篇文章，题为“美国企图在东南亚扩大战争的阴谋”。
    这篇文章说：在人们听到朝鲜停战协定签字的消息的时候，他们的心里就燃起了希望，希望亚洲一切的争执问题都可以得到解决，印度支那的战争也将结束。但是哈利逊将军在朝鲜停战协定上签字的墨迹未干，侵略的势力就开始在策划对亚洲进行战争的阴谋。在这方面，美国反动报纸上关于扩大和加紧进行印度支那战争的可能性的言论变得特别嚣张。
    契奇金纳接着说，不久以前，美国国务院发表了一个关于印度支那战争的小册子。这个小册子毫不隐讳地承认美国对于印度支那事务的军事干涉将继续加紧进行。即使根据官方的报告，在过去六个月中，每月由美国运往印度支那的战争物资平均比一九五二年几乎增加一倍。但是这还不能使美国侵略者满意。
    “华尔街日报”上刊载的一篇文章足以说明美国的侵略阴谋。据这个报纸说，国务卿杜勒斯和他的助理们已经详细拟订了一项推动印度支那战争的计划，目的是要在十八个月以内结束战争。“华尔街日报”说：这个计划的要点是准备和发动一次大规模的攻势，法军总司令纳瓦尔将军打算从一九五三年十月到一九五四年四月发动这个攻势。至于美国，它保证以空军、海军、必要时甚至以陆军支持法国军队。
    高棉、寮国和越南的傀儡政权，在杜勒斯—纳瓦尔计划中担负了重要的任务。因此，人们清楚地认识到：为什么美国的报纸最近不断为这些政权打气，并且大谈甚么给印度支那“独立”。
    契奇金纳说：非常明显，这一切关于“独立”的谈判只不过是美国的一种新阴谋，目的在于夺取法国在亚洲的地位，攫夺在印度支那的政治权力，夺取它的天然富源。美国总统本人在八月四日举行的州长年会上曾公开说：美国对这样一种解决印度支那问题的办法有直接的利害关系。他说：“让我们假定我们失去了印度支那。如果印度支那完了……那里剩下的一小片土地将是几乎无法防守的。那个地区中对我们有很大价值的锡和钨就将无法得到了。”他又说：“那里的整个局势对美国非常不利，因为最后如果我们失去那个地方，自由世界（应读为美国）怎么能守住印度尼西亚的这个富饶帝国（？）呢？”契奇金纳强调说：所谓“自由世界”感到兴趣的只不过是锡、钨、橡胶。换句话说，就是印度支那、印尼和缅甸的财富。而所谓自由世界的代表正是竭力想任意剥削东南亚国家的美国资本。
    作者最后写道：一切表明美国对建立亚洲的持久和平是不感兴趣的。
