Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 5th: The southwest mechanical industry will begin to specialize in production starting this year. At present, all state-owned mechanical factories in the southwest have determined to specialize in the production of one or several products based on the technical conditions of each factory and the actual needs of the southwest and other parts of the country. For example, the Chongqing Machine Tool Factory will specialize in manufacturing gear-making machines in the future, and the Pneumatic Tool Factory will specialize in manufacturing air compressors. Chongqing Factory 206 has been renamed Chongqing Diesel Engine Factory, and Factory 202 has been renamed Chongqing Automobile Spring Factory.昆明Factory 203 has also been renamed Kunming Machine Tool Factory and will produce several precision machine tools such as boring machines, milling machines, and grinding machines. Factory 204, which previously specialized in repairing electric motors, will be renamed Kunming Electric Motor Factory and will specialize in making generators and transformers. The Guizhou Machinery Factory, which was previously formed by the merger of several small factories and mainly did repair work, has now been renamed Guiyang Mining Machinery Manufacturing Factory. Southwest local state-owned mechanical factories will also be organized to carry out specialization, making them factories that supply agricultural machinery and construction machinery. Some local state-owned mechanical factories will be organized to process for state-owned factories; others will specialize in undertaking the mechanical repair tasks of state-owned factories.
	Organizing and implementing specialization is a practical and feasible way to develop the mechanical industry. This will make full use of the original production equipment of each factory and give full play to the original production strengths of each factory. In the past, the weaknesses of the mechanical industry were that products were not fixed, production was extremely uneven, and the capacity of production equipment could not be fully utilized, resulting in low output and high costs. After specialization, a single product can be produced in large quantities, which facilitates the organization of assembly line operations and the improvement of production technology, and this situation can be changed relatively quickly. For example, after the Chongqing Automobile Spring Factory fixed its products, its total production value this year will increase by 58% compared to last year, even with the transfer of some equipment.

    西南区机械工业今年开始实行专业分工
    【新华社重庆五日电】西南机械工业从今年起开始走向生产专业化。现在西南各国营机械工厂都已根据各厂的技术条件和西南以及全国其他地区的实际需要，确定专门生产一种或几种产品。例如重庆机床厂今后将专门制造制齿机，风动工具厂专门制造空气压缩机等产品。重庆二零六厂已改为重庆柴油机厂，二零二厂改为重庆汽车弹簧厂。昆明二零三厂，也已改为昆明机床厂，将做镗床、铣床、磨床等几种精密机床。过去专门修理电机的二零四厂将改为昆明电机厂，专门做发电机和变压器。贵州机器厂过去由几个小厂合并而成，主要做修理工作，现已改为贵阳矿山机械制造厂。西南各地方国营机械工厂也将组织起来，进行专业分工，使它成为供应农业机械、建筑用机械的工厂。有些地方国营机械厂将组织起来为国营厂加工；另外一些将专门承当国营厂的机械修理任务。
    组织起来实行专业分工是发展机械工业切实可行的途径。这样可以充分利用各厂原有的生产设备，发挥各厂原有生产特长。过去机械工业的弱点，是产品不固定，生产极不均衡，生产设备能力不能充分发挥，产量既少，成本又高。专业分工以后，一种产品可大量生产，便于组织流水作业和提高生产技术，这种现象就能比较迅速的改变。例如重庆汽车弹簧厂产品固定后，在部分设备调出的情况下，今年的生产总值还将比去年增加百分之五十八。
