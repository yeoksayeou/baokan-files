The Sichuan Province has a bumper harvest this year. In areas where the autumn harvest has been completed, rice, miscellaneous grains, and many local specialties have generally increased in production. In order to supply the needs of farmers for industrial products after the bumper harvest, promote the sales of agricultural products, expand urban-rural material exchanges, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives have expanded their purchase and sales plans for the third and fourth quarters. In terms of department store supplies, the planned sales figures for daily necessities such as sugar, matches, towels, and socks, which are in high demand by farmers, will increase by 50% to 230% in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The estimated sales volume of various dark-colored printed cloths, khaki, and flannel fabrics will increase by ten to more than forty times compared to the same period last year, and the varieties and colors will be more complete. Currently, efforts are being made to actively organize sources of goods and strengthen allocation work. State-owned commercial departments have sent people to purchasing points in various provinces and transit stations along the way to urge the timely transfer of various items. Provincial purchasing and supply stations are actively purchasing and trying to accelerate the turnover of goods. The Chengdu Supply Station of the Provincial Department Store Company recently improved the procedures for the entry and exit of goods, reducing the turnover time of goods entering and leaving the warehouse by half. Department store companies and cooperative systems are now vigorously organizing local sources of goods and actively promoting local industrial and handicraft products. Sugar, machine-made paper, alkali, and most matches produced by local state-owned industries have been sold exclusively by the Provincial Department Store Company. Processing and ordering have been increased for local private industries. Recently, department store purchasing and supply stations in Chengdu, Luxian, Neijiang, and other places have purchased cloth shoes, umbrellas, oilcloth, towels, socks, and other products produced by local handicrafts, and sales have been very smooth. In addition, many grassroots department stores and cooperatives have developed local sources of goods, actively purchasing handicrafts needed by farmers, purchasing and selling them themselves, which is very popular among producers and consumers. While expanding the supply of industrial products, state-owned commercial and cooperative systems have expanded the amount of investment according to actual needs and actively purchased and promoted agricultural products. The Provincial Trading Company increased its investment amount in the second half of the year by 90% compared to the first half of the year in order to purchase a large number of local specialties that are being launched on the market. The cooperative system expects that the total sales amount in the second half of the year will increase by nearly two times compared to the first half of the year. At present, the most important grain purchase work has entered the action stage, and more than 1,900 grain purchase bases across the province are gradually launching purchase work. In areas where the autumn harvest has been completed, grain is being actively put on the market. The purchase figures for local specialties are also constantly increasing. The current problems are: some state-owned commercial and cooperative cadres still have the negative management thinking of "fearing stockpiles, not fearing out-of-stock situations," and the concept of serving industrial and agricultural production is not clear enough, and they do not actively develop sources of goods in terms of material supply. At present, the sales plans of some state-owned stores and cooperatives are still low, and they have a poor understanding of the needs of the local people, the production and sales of goods, and market changes. Therefore, in some places, once the purchasing power of farmers pours into the market, it often exceeds expectations, and state-owned stores or cooperatives are temporarily overwhelmed and unable to cope, resulting in temporary out-of-stock situations for certain items, and speculative private merchants take the opportunity to raise prices. In terms of grain purchase, most can achieve reasonable prices, and farmers can sell their grain as soon as they arrive. However, it has also been found that some places do not have sufficient preparation for purchase locations and personnel, and farmers line up to sell grain, waiting from morning to night. Some farmers are eager to sell and sell at low prices to private merchants. And the market lacks management of private merchants, and some speculative private merchants take the opportunity to suppress and raise prices, illegally purchasing outside the market, causing market chaos. The above-mentioned problems have aroused the attention of the Provincial Department of Commerce and the preparatory committee of the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives and other relevant leading departments. In places where problems have occurred, they are being resolved in a timely manner. At the same time, the negative management thinking of "fearing stockpiles, not fearing out-of-stock situations" of cadres in state-owned commercial and cooperative departments is being corrected through work arrangements, inspections, and various meetings, so that everyone can actively expand commodity circulation, invigorate the urban and rural economy, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

    四川省商业部门和合作社系统
    适应农民需要扩大供销计划
    部分单位还有“怕积压、不怕脱销”思想亟待克服
    四川省今年全面丰收。在秋收已完的地区，稻谷、杂粮和许多土特产普遍获得增产。为供应丰收后农民对工业品的需要和推销农产品，扩大城乡物资交流，巩固工农联盟，国营商业部门和合作社已扩大了第三、四季度的收购和销售计划。百货供应上对农民用量较大的糖、火柴、毛巾、袜子等日用品，第三季度计划销售数字比第二季度增加了百分之五十到二、三倍。纱布类的各种深色花布、卡其布、绒布等预计销售量比去年同期则增加了十倍到四十多倍，品种花色也更加齐全。目前正在积极组织货源，加强调拨工作，国营商业部门已派人到省外各地采购点及沿途各转运站，督促各种物品及时转运。省内各采购供应站正在积极进行采购，并设法加速商品流转。省百货公司成都供应站最近改进了商品进出手续，使商品进出库的流转时间减少了一半。百货公司和合作社系统现正大力组织地方货源，积极推销地方工业和手工业产品。地方国营工业所出产的糖、机制纸、碱及大部分火柴，已由省百货公司包销。对当地私营工业已增加了加工、订货。最近成都、泸县、内江等地百货采购供应站，曾收购了当地手工业生产的布鞋、雨伞、油布、毛巾、袜子等，推销均很顺利。另有不少基层百货商店和合作社，就地开辟货源，积极采购为农民所需要的手工业品，自购自销，甚受生产和消费者的欢迎。与扩大供应工业品同时，国营商业和合作社系统已按实际需要扩大了投放金额，积极收购和推销农产品。省贸易公司为大量收购陆续上市的土特产，下半年投放金额比上半年增加百分之九十。合作社系统预计下半年推销总额较上半年增加将近两倍。目前最重要的粮食收购工作已由准备进入行动阶段，全省一千九百多个购粮基点正陆续展开收购工作。在秋收已完的地区，粮食上市十分踊跃。土特产收购数字也在不断上升。目前存在的问题是：部分国营商业和合作社干部还存在“怕积压、不怕脱销”的消极经营思想，为工农业生产服务的观念不够明确，在物资供应方面不去积极地开辟货源。目前有些国营商店和合作社的销售计划还是偏低的，而对当地群众的需要，物品的产销情况及市场的变化了解就更差。因此，有些地方当农民购买力一旦涌入市场，往往超过预计，国营商店或合作社临时手忙脚乱已应付不足，以致造成某些物品一时脱销，投机私商则乘机抬价。在粮食收购方面，大部分都能作到价格合理，农民随到随收。但也发现有的地方对收购地点和人员准备不足，农民排队售粮，从早等到晚。有的农民急于出售，就低价卖给私商。而市场上对私商又缺乏管理，一些投机私商就乘机压价、抬价，在市场以外非法收购，造成市场的混乱。上述问题已引起省商业厅及合作社省联社筹备委员会等有关领导部门的注意，在已发生问题的地方，正在及时解决，同时，并不断通过对工作的布置、检查及各种会议，纠正国营商业和合作社部门干部的“怕积压、不怕脱销”的消极经营思想，使大家积极地扩大商品流转，活跃城乡经济，巩固工农联盟。（本报记者林沫）
