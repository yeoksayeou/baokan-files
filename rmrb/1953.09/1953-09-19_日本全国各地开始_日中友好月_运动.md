Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The "Sino-Japanese Friendship Month" movement, organized by the Japan-China Friendship Association, began on September 18th throughout Japan. Prior to this, the Japan-China Friendship Association held a Kansai region activist conference in Osaka on August 30th to discuss expanding the Sino-Japanese friendship movement and launching the "Sino-Japanese Friendship Month" movement. Participants included Masao Shimada, Director of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Moriichi Muto, Professor of Ritsumeikan University and Director of the Japan-China Friendship Association Kyoto Federation, and 64 representatives from branches in Osaka, Kobe, Nara, and other places.

The work reports from various branches and branch preparation committees showed that the Sino-Japanese friendship movement in various places has achieved further development. For example, the Japan-China Friendship Association Kyoto Federation has held seven "Lectures on Chinese Affairs" since August 4th, with a large number of attendees each time. The Sino-Japanese friendship movement has penetrated many labor union organizations, and Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto has become an activity center for the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. The members of the Kobe branch preparation committee and local residents have been very active in assisting the departure of the Japanese "Guardians of the Remains of Chinese Martyrs" and preparing to welcome Japanese returnees from China. In addition, the Sino-Japanese friendship movements in Nara, Amagasaki, Wakayama, and Osaka are also continuing to develop.

Regarding the activities of "Sino-Japanese Friendship Month," various branches and branch preparation committees are preparing to universally launch a movement to invite a delegation from the Chinese Red Cross to visit Japan and promote Sino-Japanese trade, hold celebrations for China's National Day, worker representative meetings, commemorative meetings for Lu Xun, and screen Chinese films, according to the overall plan. In addition, Osaka plans to perform "The True Story of Ah Q"; Kyoto will hold a large-scale exhibition introducing the situation in China; Kobe and Nara have decided to hold branch establishment conferences in late September and October 1st; Wakayama Prefecture, which recently suffered a major flood, also plans to launch a movement to thank China for remitting funds to relieve Japanese flood victims.

During the discussion on expanding the Sino-Japanese friendship movement and strengthening publicity activities, the attendees unanimously agreed that it is necessary to combine the people's demands for peace, their demands for daily life, and the Sino-Japanese friendship movement.

    日本全国各地开始“日中友好月”运动
    【新华社十八日讯】东京消息：日中友好协会举办的“日中友好月”运动于九月十八日在日本全国各地开始。在这以前，日中友好协会于八月三十日在大阪召开了关西地方活动分子会议，讨论关于扩大日中友好运动及开展“日中友好月”运动。到会的有日中友好协会理事岛田政雄、日中友好协会京都联合会理事长立命馆大学教授武藤守一以及大阪、神户、奈良等地分会的代表六十四人。
    各分会及分会筹备会的工作报告显示出：各地的日中友好运动已获得进一步的发展。如日中友好协会京都联合会自八月四日以来举行了七次“中国事情讲演会”，每次听讲的人都很多。日中友好运动已深入到许多工会团体，京都的立命馆大学已成为日中友好运动的活动中心。神户分会筹备会的会员和当地居民对协助日本“中国人殉难者遗骨护送团”起程及筹备迎接从中国回国的日侨等方面，都非常活跃。此外，奈良、尼崎、和歌山和大阪等地的日中友好运动，也在继续发展中。
    关于“日中友好月”的活动，各分会和分会筹备会正根据总的计划，准备普遍展开邀请中国红十字会代表团访问日本和促进日中贸易的运动，举行庆祝中国国庆大会、工人代表会议、纪念鲁迅大会以及放映中国电影等活动。此外，大阪还计划公演“阿Q正传”；京都将举办介绍中国情况的大规模的展览会；神户、奈良两地决定在九月下旬和十月一日举行分会成立大会；最近曾遭到大水灾的和歌山县并计划展开一个感谢中国汇款救济日本水灾灾民的运动。
    在讨论扩大日中友好运动和加强宣传活动等问题时，到会者一致认为必须把人民对和平的要求、对日常生活的要求和日中友好运动结合起来。
