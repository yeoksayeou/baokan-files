According to TASS, September 11th: The Soviet "Red Star" published an article written by Vilhinin, entitled "Ceylon Resists American Manipulation."

Vilhinin wrote: In 1951, due to the insistence of the United States, trade between Ceylon and the People's Republic of China was stopped. The United States, taking advantage of its monopoly in rubber purchases, drastically reduced the price of Ceylon rubber. The US refusal to pay normal prices seriously affected Ceylon: it reduced rubber production, bankrupted farmers and employers, and increased unemployment. In addition, the reduction in rubber sales made Ceylon unable to purchase even half of the rice it needed. Famine broke out across the country.

Vilhinin continued: For two years, the Ceylonese government has repeatedly sent delegations to the United States in an attempt to reach an agreement on selling Ceylon rubber at normal prices and buying American rice. However, the monopolists on the other side of the Atlantic, caring only about their own profits, remained steadfast in their attitude. Subsequently, Ceylon rejected the American demands and began trade negotiations with the People's Republic of China.

Vilhinin continued: After successful negotiations between the People's Republic of China and Ceylon at the end of last year, a five-year trade agreement was concluded under mutually acceptable conditions. According to this agreement, the People's Republic of China will buy 50,000 tons of rubber from Ceylon each year and sell rice to Ceylon.

Referring to the importance of this agreement, the Prime Minister of Ceylon pointed out: This agreement saved Ceylon from misfortune. According to Ceylonese newspapers, this agreement solved Ceylon's serious food shortage problem, eliminated the threat of economic collapse, and saved 300,000 people from unemployment. Thanks to the establishment of relations with China, Ceylon has already achieved a favorable trade balance in May of this year.

The people of Ceylon warmly praised the agreement concluded with the People's Republic of China. As for the American monopolists, they were greatly angered by Ceylon's "bad example" and feared that other Asian countries would follow Ceylon's lead. That is why the former Director of the Mutual Security Agency, Harriman, said: The United States must pay serious attention to the issue of the new relationship between Ceylon and China and threatened to take sanctions against Ceylon.

American reactionary newspapers also threatened Ceylon. However, Washington's threat to Ceylon failed, because the issue of selling rubber at normal prices was a matter of life and death for Ceylon.

Vilhinin pointed out that America's manipulation policy has bankrupted in Ceylon. It is also encountering increasing resistance in other countries in Southeast Asia. Newspapers in these countries unanimously agree with Ceylon's actions, considering them important and courageous, and advocating the development of trade with China and other democratic countries.

### 苏联“红星报”载文指出  美国的操纵政策在锡兰破产了

    苏联“红星报”载文指出
    美国的操纵政策在锡兰破产了
     【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社十一日讯：苏联“红星报”发表维尔希宁所写的一篇文章，题目是“锡兰抵抗美国的操纵”。
    维尔希宁写道：一九五一年，由于美国的坚持，锡兰和中华人民共和国的贸易被停止了。美国利用它在购买橡胶方面的垄断，剧烈地减低锡兰橡胶的价格。美国的拒绝付给正常价格，严重地影响了锡兰：减少了橡胶的生产，使得农民和雇主破产，失业人数增加。此外，橡胶销售量的缩减，使得锡兰甚至无力购买它所必需的大米的一小半。全国发生了饥荒。
    维尔希宁接着说：两年来，锡兰政府为了谋求达成关于以正常价格出售锡兰橡胶及买进美国大米的协议，曾经一再派遣代表团到美国去。但是，大西洋那边的垄断资本家只顾他们自己的利润，态度坚决不变。此后，锡兰就拒绝了美国的要求，开始和中华人民共和国进行贸易谈判。
    维尔希宁继续说：去年年底，中华人民共和国和锡兰之间的谈判成功以后，在双方都能接受的条件下缔结了一项五年贸易协定。按照这项协定，中华人民共和国将每年从锡兰买进五万吨橡胶，并卖大米给锡兰。
    锡兰总理在谈到这项协定的重要性时指出：这项协定把锡兰从不幸中挽救出来。据锡兰的报纸说，这项协定解决了锡兰的严重粮食缺乏的问题，消除了经济崩溃的威胁，并且使三十万人免于失业。由于和中国建立了关系，今年五月份锡兰已经获得了有利的贸易平衡。
      锡兰人民热烈赞扬和中华人民共和国缔结的协定。至于美国垄断资本家们，他们由于锡兰的“坏例子”而大为愤怒，害怕其他亚洲国家跟锡兰学。这就是为什么前共同安全署署长哈里曼说：美国对于锡兰和中国之间新的关系的问题，必须予以严重的注意，并威胁要对锡兰采取制裁手段。
      美国反动报纸也威胁锡兰。但是，华盛顿对锡兰的威胁失败了，因为以正常价格销售橡胶的问题，对锡兰是一个生死问题。
    维尔希宁指出，美国的操纵政策在锡兰破产了。它在东南亚其他国家中，也正遭遇到越来越大的反抗。这些国家的报纸一致赞同锡兰的行动，认为这是重要的和勇敢的行动，并主张发展和中国及其他民主国家的贸易。
