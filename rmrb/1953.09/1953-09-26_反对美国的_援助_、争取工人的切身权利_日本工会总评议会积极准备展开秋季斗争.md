Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the largest trade union organization in Japan, is actively preparing to launch an autumn struggle. According to Sohyo's plan, the focus of this struggle will be concentrated on: opposing the American Mutual Security Agency's "aid," demanding wage increases, opposing the management's large-scale layoffs through "enterprise rationalization," and revising labor contracts.

The first mass rallies are scheduled to be held in Tokyo on September 28th and 29th to oppose the Yoshida government's acceptance of the so-called "aid" from the American Mutual Security Agency. Mass rallies planned to be held across the country when the next Diet session convenes are also in active preparation. The slogans raised at the rallies will include: "Oppose Japanese rearmament, oppose accepting aid from the Mutual Security Agency, oppose supplying military bases to the American military."

On the 17th, Sohyo and the left-wing Socialist Party jointly sponsored a public rally in Tokyo to oppose American Mutual Security Agency "aid." The conference passed a resolution pointing out that American Mutual Security Agency "aid" is a means to conceal Japanese rearmament and a prelude to establishing a war economy. The resolution stated that the participants are determined to continue to fight against American Mutual Security Agency "aid" and rearmament in order to defend the peace clauses of the Japanese Constitution.

    反对美国的“援助”、争取工人的切身权利
    日本工会总评议会积极准备展开秋季斗争
    【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：日本最大的工会组织日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）正在积极准备展开秋季斗争。根据“总评”的计划，这次斗争的中心将集中在：反对美国共同安全署的“援助”、要求增加工资、反对资方大规模解雇工人的“企业合理化”和修改劳工合同。
    第一个群众集会准备在九月二十八日和二十九日在东京举行，反对吉田政府接受美国共同安全署的所谓“援助”。计划在下届国会会议召开时将在全国各地举行的群众集会，也在积极准备中，大会提出的口号将包括：“反对日本重整军备，反对接受共同安全署的援助，反对以军事基地供给美军。”
    十七日，“总评”和左派社会党在东京联合主办了一次公共集会，反对美国共同安全署“援助”。大会通过了一项决议，指出美国共同安全署“援助”是掩饰日本重整军备的一种手段，是建立战争经济的先声。决议声明，与会者决心继续为反对美国共同安全署“援助”和重整军备而斗争，以保卫日本宪法的和平条款。
