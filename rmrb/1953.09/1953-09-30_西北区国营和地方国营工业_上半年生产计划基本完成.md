Northwest Region State-owned and locally state-owned industries basically completed their production plans for the first half of 1953. According to statistics from the Northwest Administrative Committee Statistics Bureau: From January to June, the total output value completed 99.71% of the plan, reaching 45.86% of the annual plan; more than double the total output value of the same period last year.

The specific situation of industrial production in the first half of the year is as follows: In the state-owned industrial system, the total output value completed 101.06% of the plan, reaching 46.98% of the annual plan. Among them, the petroleum industry, which accounts for a large proportion of Northwest industry, exceeded the plan by 5.49%, and the total output value increased by one-half compared with the same period last year; the textile industry completed 99.63% of the plan, and the total output value increased by nearly one time compared with the same period last year; construction enterprises completed 92.97% of the plan, and the total output value increased by nearly five times compared with the same period last year. In the local state-owned industrial system, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang and Xi'an all exceeded the plan, with Ningxia exceeding by 38.57%, Shaanxi completed 98.99% of the plan, and Gansu only completed 79.64% of the plan. The total industrial output value of these provinces and cities has increased significantly compared with the same period last year. The total amount of profits turned over to the state by the state-owned industrial system exceeded the plan, and the unit cost plans of many factories and mines were also well implemented. The product cost of Yumen Oil Mine decreased by 31.1% compared with the same period last year, and the product costs of Xi'an Power Plant, Lanzhou Power Plant and several cotton textile factories have been reduced significantly compared with last year. The average labor production value of each worker in the state-owned industry in the entire region also exceeded the plan, and increased by about 35% compared with the same period last year. On the basis of increased production, the average wage of employees increased by 19.73% compared with last year. Factories and mines have made considerable progress in enterprise management and technological improvement.

However, judging from the implementation of the overall industrial production plan, it is still not satisfactory. First, many factories and mines still cannot complete the plan evenly and comprehensively. The general situation is "loose at the beginning and tight at the end." Some workers in some departments said: "Look at the beginning of the month, slow down in the middle of the month, and rush at the end of the month." The same is true for each quarter. Therefore, the product plan for the first half of the year was not well completed. Except for petroleum and power departments, the region did not complete the product plans for cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and flour. Among the 47 major products in the region, 12 products did not complete the plan. Some factories and mines completed the total output value plan and product plan, but did not complete the labor plan, cost plan, financial plan or material supply plan. Second, the situation of neglecting quality is still very serious. In May, the substandard rate of light fuel oil at Yumen Oil Mine accounted for 39.1% of the output, the average scrap rate of the main products of the casting workshop of Northwest First Machine Manufacturing Plant was over 40%, and the scrap rate of wool scouring machine boards cast by Lanzhou Machine Factory reached 75%. In addition, the substandard rate in printing and dyeing and coal industry is also very high. In addition, industrial accidents in the first half of the year were also quite serious. In the machinery industry, the equipment utilization rate has not been fully utilized. At present, the factories, mines, and construction enterprises in the Northwest region are carrying out a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and will make greater efforts to ensure the comprehensive and overfulfillment of the national plan, and to improve the level of enterprise management.

    西北区国营和地方国营工业
    上半年生产计划基本完成
    西北全区国营及地方国营工业一九五三年上半年生产计划基本完成。据西北行政委员会统计局统计：一月份到六月份，总产值完成计划百分之九十九点七一，达到全年计划百分之四十五点八六；比去年同期总产值增长了一倍多。
    上半年工业生产的具体情况是：国营工业系统，总产值完成计划百分之一○一点○六，达到全年计划百分之四十六点九八。其中，占西北工业比重较大的石油工业，超额完成计划百分之五点四九，比去年同期总产值增长了二分之一；纺织工业完成计划百分之九十九点六三，比去年同期总产值增长了将近一倍；建筑企业完成计划百分之九十二点九七，比去年同期总产值增长了将近五倍。在地方国营工业系统中，宁夏、青海、新疆和西安市，都超额完成了计划，宁夏超额数字为百分之三十八点五七，陕西完成计划百分之九十八点九九，甘肃只完成了计划百分之七十九点六四。这些省、市工业总产值都比去年同期有显著的增长。国营工业系统上缴利润总额超额完成，许多厂矿单位成本计划也执行得很好。玉门油矿产品成本比去年同期降低了百分之三十一点一，西安电厂、兰州电厂和几个棉纺织厂的产品成本，都比去年降低了不少。全区国营工业平均每一工人劳动生产价值，也超额完成了计划，比去年同期提高了百分之三十五左右。在增加生产的基础上，职工平均工资比去年增加了百分之十九点七三。各厂矿在企业管理、技术改进等方面，都有了不少进步。
    但是，从整个工业生产计划的执行情况来看，还是不能令人满意的。第一，许多厂矿还不能均衡地全面地完成计划。一般情况是“前松后紧”。有些部门中的工人说：“月初看，月中缓，月末赶。”每一季度也是一样。因此，上半年的产品计划完成得不很好。全区除石油及电业等部门完成产品计划外，棉纱、棉布、面粉等部门都没有完成产品计划。全区四十七种主要产品中，有十二种产品没有完成计划。有的厂矿完成了总产值计划、产品计划，但没有完成劳动计划、成本计划、财务计划或物资供应计划。第二，忽视质量的情况还很严重。玉门油矿五月份轻机油的次品率占产量百分之三十九点一，西北第一机器制造厂铸工车间主要产品报废率平均在百分之四十以上，兰州机器厂铸造洗毛机板报废率达到百分之七十五，其他如印染、煤业中的次品率也很高。此外，上半年工伤事故也相当严重。在机械工业中，设备利用率还没有充分发挥出来。现在西北全区厂矿、建筑企业职工正开展增产节约竞赛，将以更大的努力来保证全面地超额完成国家计划，并将企业管理水平提高一步。
