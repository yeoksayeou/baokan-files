    Harbin Junior Technical School Should Take Care of the Living Habits of Hui Students
    A reader from Harbin wrote: Certain leading cadres of Harbin Junior Technical School are not concerned enough about the lives of Hui students. There are sixteen Hui students in the school, all of whom live on campus, but the school has never had a Hui Muslim dining hall. Only after repeated requests from Hui students did the school set up a Hui kitchen. However, this kitchen is often occupied and moved, and sometimes the dishes made for Hui students are still served from the general kitchen, often containing pork and pork bones. When Hui students raised objections to the school about this, some teachers instead said they had ideological problems. When Hui students reported this to the school's Party branch secretary, the Party branch secretary also said without concern, "Let me look into it..." and then did nothing about it. The food in the Hui kitchen is very bad, with vegetarian food every day. The Hui students requested some beef for cooking, but the school did not resolve this. In addition, a small number of Han students in the school also have behaviors that do not respect the customs of the Hui people, and the school does not promptly educate them, which affects the unity of Hui and Han students. I believe that the school leaders should immediately pay attention to the above problems and correct this phenomenon of not taking care of the customs of Hui students.

    哈尔滨初级技工学校校方应照顾回族学生的生活习惯
    哈尔滨一读者来信：哈尔滨初级技工学校某些领导干部对回族学生的生活不够关心。该校有回族学生十六人，全部在校内住宿，但过去学校却一直没有回民食堂。经回族学生多次请求，校方才设立回民伙房。可是这个伙房常被占用和迁移，有时给回族学生做的菜仍是从大伙房盛来的，时常发现猪肉和猪骨头。回族学生为此向校方提意见，有的老师反而说他们有思想问题。回族学生向学校党支部书记反映，党支部书记也毫不关心地说：“等我了解了解……”以后就不管了。回民伙房的伙食很不好，天天吃素，回族学生要求弄点牛肉做菜，校方也不解决。此外，该校少数汉族学生还有不尊重回民风俗习惯的行为，校方也不及时予以教育，影响了回汉同学的团结。我认为，该校领导方面应该立刻注意以上问题，并纠正这种不照顾回族学生的风俗习惯的现象。
