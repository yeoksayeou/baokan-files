    The people in the valley are moving forward
    ——A Record of New Developments in Yao People's Production Reform
    Cai Zhongyun Tang Zesheng Jiang Huifen
    The Yao Mountain valley area is a remote mountainous region in the southwest of Libo County, Guizhou Province. More than 160 Yao households live here. Below Yao Mountain, the Zhang River meanders through fields and hills, and the land on both banks of the Zhang River is fertile, suitable for growing rice, millet, corn, and cotton. However, during the period of reactionary rule, this fertile land did not bring happiness to the Yao people. For many years, the Yao people suffered long-term oppression, massacre, and plunder by the Kuomintang reactionary government, landlords, and bandits. The Yao people had no interest in developing production, and these fertile lands were left barren. In the past, the Yao people did not have iron plows and harrows and did not know how to grow paddy fields. They relied on growing miscellaneous grains such as corn and millet for many years. Due to the lack of agricultural tools, the Yao people had developed the habit of "going up the mountain to hunt" and "eat when they caught something." Their agricultural production was generally in a backward state. Most of the Yao villages still used the relatively primitive "slash-and-burn" method of production. They cut down the wild forests on the barren slopes and in the cracks of rocks with knives, burned them clean with fire, and sowed the seeds after the fire went out. They never plowed, hoed, or applied manure, and waited for the harvest after sowing. This production method often brought many natural disasters to the Yao people. Once, Mo Zhian, a Yao villager from Laqiao Village, set fire to the mountain to grow millet. The fire was blown up by the wind, causing a mountain fire that destroyed countless forests and burned all the houses and livestock of several families on the slope to ashes. After the forest was burned down, this area was often subjected to strong winds.
    After liberation, in order to support the Yao people in Yao Mountain to develop production, the People's Government helped the Yao people improve agricultural tools and farming methods, and successively distributed more than 3,800 pieces of high-quality iron agricultural tools, as well as a large number of ploughing cattle, fertilizers, seeds, and grain loans, solving the Yao people's serious lack of production materials. Now, in every Yao household's thatched cottage, there are plows, harrows, hoes and other agricultural tools. This has greatly increased the Yao people's enthusiasm for production and encouraged their sentiment for production reform.
    In the spring of the year before last, when the people of the motherland were enthusiastically engaged in the agricultural production increase campaign, every Yao villager in the Yao Mountain valley also carried a high degree of production enthusiasm, actively carrying out activities to improve agricultural tools and farming techniques on the basis of their original production. The People's Government absorbed a large number of Yao cadres to study production technology in the county agricultural training class, and often organized the Yao people to go down the mountain to visit state-owned farms and the production of mutual aid groups of Han and Yi farmers. This enabled the Yao people to understand a lot of knowledge about agricultural production, and actively launched activities to learn the use of agricultural tools and rice field technology from Han and Yi farmers. Despite the rugged roads in the valley, and despite the crazy attacks of strong winds and rain, the Yao people never gave up a single opportunity to learn production technology.
    In the process of learning production technology, the Yao people experienced a difficult process. For example, when Yao villager Lan Bushui first learned to plow the fields, he did not know how to use the cattle, and the cattle would not move; he could not hold the plow, and the plowing was crooked. After working hard for a day, he was exhausted and sweating, but he still could not plow a piece of land well. Sometimes he was very discouraged, feeling that using this thing to grow millet was not as good as growing corn on the barren slope, but when he thought of the life of drinking wild vegetable porridge in the past, he was determined to learn to grow paddy fields. Every day, as soon as the sky was slightly bright, he called Yao villagers Lan Fuya, He Laodi, etc. to go down the mountain to find Han and Yi farmers to teach them. After their hard study, they finally learned all the techniques of using plows and harrows and growing paddy fields. Those who learned went to teach those who did not, and many Yao people slowly learned these farming methods.
    In the past, during the busy farming season, the Yao people carried dilapidated wooden plows and harrows and "crowbars" with a small amount of iron to the ground to turn the soil. One person could only turn half a load of corn land in a day. Now, after the Yao people have learned the technique of using cattle plows and harrows, one person can plow more than a dozen loads of corn land in a day. The production efficiency has increased more than ten times than before. In the past, the Yao people generally had to plant corn at the end of March, but now they have planted all the corn in mid-February. After the production efficiency was improved, the Yao people saved a lot of labor, and then they used this labor to process the land and develop production. In the past, Yao villagers He Laokang, He Laofang, He Jinguide and others never applied fertilizer to the land they cultivated. Now they have also developed the habit of accumulating fertilizer. They often go to cut grass and pick up manure. Some raise cattle and pigs to step on manure, build manure pits, and accumulate piles of manure and grass. Generally, the Yao people are also more meticulous in farming than before. For example, the Yao villager Han Laoyong's mutual aid group plowed and harrowed one more time and hoeed two more times this year when planting cotton and corn than in previous years, and they also developed the habit of selecting seeds. This year, the Yao people in many villages not only finished planting corn, millet, cotton, and sweet potatoes in advance, but also reclaimed a lot of wasteland and expanded the cultivated area. For example, the eleven Yao households in Laqiao Village, which used to cultivate the least land, only had one hundred loads of land in the past, which was not enough for cultivation. This year, they organized two mutual aid groups and planted the one hundred loads of land with corn and cotton in advance, and also added thirty loads of wasteland to plant millet and sweet potatoes. At the same time, they also planted 350 loads of paddy rice for the first time, which they had never planted before.
    In order to further develop production, the Yao people have also organized many mutual aid groups with various fraternal ethnic groups, and the national unity and friendship has been further consolidated from the mutual assistance in production labor. For example, the Li Laoda mutual aid group jointly organized by the Yao, Miao, and Yi ethnic groups has made great progress in production since its establishment more than a year ago. Yao villager He Laonai and others live on the mountain, and it is inconvenient to carry manure down the mountain. Yi villager He Shugang gave them more than 30 loads of manure from the foot of the mountain, and the Yao people applied manure to He Shugang's corn land on the mountain. Yao villager Li Laoda did not know how to grow rice and accumulate fertilizer. Miao villager Wang Dengyuan taught him when they exchanged work in the mutual aid. As a result of the organization, the farming technology was improved, and a lot of labor was saved to process the land. Now, they generally plow three times and hoe three times when planting corn and cotton, and each load of land is also fertilized with five to seven loads of manure. The crops are growing more vigorously than ever before, and they have achieved a bumper harvest that has never been seen in history. Yao villager He Xinmin, a member of the group, used to plant eight loads of corn land, and the best year only yielded more than 400 kilograms of net corn. After participating in the mutual aid group and using cattle plows and applying fertilizer, this year his eight loads of corn land has yielded 640 kilograms of net corn, an increase of more than 50% compared with previous years. At present, his cotton and millet are growing even more vigorously. Many Yao people have generally obtained a bumper harvest. This is something that has never happened in Yao Mountain! Now, Yao Mountain is showing a new atmosphere everywhere.
    The Yao people, who are constantly developing in production, have gradually changed their past poor life. In the past, many Yao people could not eat white rice and salt all year round, and many people had no clothes to wear. This year, the average Yao person can eat two dou of white rice and more than ten kilograms of salt, and each person can wear a new set of clothes a year. Almost every Yao household raises pigs. Some Yao people have also entered primary schools and folk schools to study. Although the production technology of the Yao people in the Yao Mountain valley has not completely escaped the "slash-and-burn" method; their lives are not as good as those of the Han and Yi people. However, they firmly believe that with wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the active support of the People's Government and the friendly assistance of the people of all fraternal ethnic groups, it will not be long before they can leapfrog to catch up with the production of all fraternal ethnic groups. Now, the Yao people are full of high production enthusiasm and confidence, and are continuing to reform production tools and production technology, striving to achieve a state of having enough to eat and wear in the coming years.

    山谷里的人们在前进
    ——记瑶民生产改革的新气象
    蔡中运　唐泽生　江慧芬
    瑶山夹谷一带，是贵州省荔波县西南边的一个偏僻山区。这里聚居着一百六十多户瑶族人民。瑶山下面，有一条漳江，曲折地绕着田野和山岗奔流着，漳江的两岸，土地肥沃，是一片适宜种植稻谷、谷子、苞谷、棉花的好地方。但是，在反动统治时期，这些肥美的土地，并没有给瑶民们带来幸福。好多年来，瑶民们长期地遭受着国民党反动政府、地主、匪首的压迫、屠杀和抢掠，瑶民们没有心思发展生产，这些肥沃的土地一直被荒芜着。以前，瑶民们没有铁质犁耙农具，也不会种稻田，常年靠种苞谷、谷子等杂粮为生。由于农具的缺乏，瑶民们曾养成了“上山打猎”、“赶上吃饭”的习惯。他们的农业生产还普遍处在落后状态中，一般是广种薄收，而绝大部分村寨中的瑶民，还在使用着比较原始的“刀耕火种”的生产方式，他们在荒草坡上和石头缝里，用刀将荒林砍倒放火烧光，火熄后就播种，从来不犁、不锄、不上粪，下种后就等着收成了。这种生产方法，常常给瑶民们带来了许多自然灾害。一次，拉苕寨瑶民莫志安放火烧山种谷子，火被风卷起，引起漫山大火，烧毁了无数山林，把坡上的几家房屋和牲畜全部烧成灰烬。森林烧光后，这里便经常遭受大风的侵袭。
    解放后，人民政府为了扶持瑶山中的瑶民们发展生产，帮助瑶民改良农具和耕作方法，先后发放了三千八百多件优良铁质的农具，和大批的耕牛，肥料，种籽，口粮等贷款，解决了瑶民们严重缺乏生产资料的困难。现在，在每户瑶民的茅屋里，都摆着犁、耙、锄等农具。这便大大地提高了瑶民们的生产积极性，鼓舞着瑶民们生产改革的情绪。
    前年春天，祖国人民热烈进行农业增产运动的时候，瑶山夹谷里每个瑶民也怀着高度的生产热情，在他们原有的生产基础上，积极地开展了改良农具与耕作技术的活动。人民政府大量吸收了瑶族干部到县农训班学习生产技术，并经常组织瑶民们下山来参观国营农场和汉、彝族农民互助组的生产。使瑶民们懂得了农业生产上的许多知识，积极地向汉、彝族农民展开了学习使用农具和种水田技术的活动。尽管山谷里的道路崎岖难走，尽管大风雨疯狂袭击，瑶民们始终没有放弃过一次可以学习生产技术的机会。
    在学习生产技术中，瑶民们曾经历了一段艰苦困难的过程，如瑶民兰布水初学犁田时，不会使牛，牛不走；不会拿犁，犁起来东倒西歪，忙了一天，累的满头大汗，还犁不好一块田。有时他很灰心，感到用这家伙种谷子还不如在荒草坡里种苞谷好，但他想起过去喝野菜稀饭的生活时，还是下了决心，一定要学会种水田。每天天一麻麻亮，他就叫着瑶民蓝甫亚，何老弟等下山去找汉、彝族农民教他们。经过他们苦心学习，终于学会了使用犁耙和种稻田的全部技术。学会了的又去教不会的，许多瑶民便也慢慢地学会了这些耕作方法。
    往年农忙的时候，瑶民们扛着破烂的木犁木耙和带有少量铁质的“翻撬”下地翻土，一人一天只能翻完半挑苞谷地，如今，瑶民们学会了使用牛犁牛耙的技术后，一人一天就能犁完十几挑苞谷地，生产效率比以前提高了十多倍，过去，瑶民们一般要在三月底才能种好的苞谷，如今他们在二月中旬就全部种好了。生产效率提高后，瑶民们节省了许多劳动力，接着他们又把这些劳动力用到土地加工和发展生产上去。从前瑶民何老扛、何老芳、何金贵等种地从不上粪，现在他们也养成了积肥的习惯。他们经常去打草拣粪，有的养了牛和猪踩粪，盖了粪坑，积存起一堆一堆的粪草。一般瑶民在耕作上也比以前细致了，像瑶民韩老勇互助组今年栽种棉花、苞谷、比往年要多犁耙了一道，多薅了二道，并且还养成了选种的习惯。今年，许多村寨的瑶民，不但提前种完了苞谷、谷子、棉花、红苕，还开垦了很多荒地，扩大了耕种面积。如过去耕地最少的拉苕寨十一户瑶民，往年仅有一百挑地，不够耕种，今年，组织了两个互助组，提前将一百挑地分别种上苞谷、棉花后，还添开了三十挑荒地来栽种谷子、红苕，同时，还第一次种上了他们从来没有种过的三百五十挑田的稻谷。
    为了进一步发展生产，瑶民们还和各兄弟民族组织了许多互助组，从生产劳动互助中，更加巩固了民族团结友谊。如瑶、苗、彝三族联合组织的黎老大互助组，成立一年多来，生产上就有了很大发展。瑶民何老奶等住在山上，抬粪下山不方便，彝族何树刚就把山下的三十多挑粪给他们，何树刚在山上的苞谷地，瑶民又给他上粪，瑶民黎老大不会种田积肥，苗族王登源在互助换活时便教他，由于组织起来的结果，提高了耕作技术，节省了许多劳动力用到土地加工上去。如今，他们种苞谷、棉花，一般都犁了三道，薅了三道，每挑地也放了五挑到七挑粪，庄稼长的比任何时期都茁壮，获得历史上未有过的丰收，瑶民组员何信民，往年他种的八挑苞谷地，最好的年成只收到四百多斤净苞谷。参加了互助组和使用牛犁，施肥后，今年他这八挑苞谷地已收了六百四十斤净苞谷，比往年增产百分之五十以上。目前，他的棉花、谷子长得更加茁壮。许多瑶民一般都获得了丰收。这都是瑶山从没有过的事情呵！如今瑶山上到处呈现了一片新生的气象。
    在生产上不断发展的瑶民，已经逐渐改变了过去穷困的生活。以前很多瑶民整年吃不上白米和盐，许多人没有衣服穿，今年一般瑶民已经可以吃到二斗白米，十几斤盐，每人一年可以穿上一套新衣，差不多每户瑶民都养了猪。一些瑶民还进了小学和民校去读书。虽然，瑶山夹谷里的瑶民们的生产技术，至今还没有完全摆脱“刀耕火种”的方法；生活还没有像汉、彝族一样的好。可是，他们深信，有了中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，在人民政府的积极扶持和各兄弟民族人民的友爱帮助下，用不了多长日子，他们就可以飞跃地赶上各兄弟民族的生产了。现在，瑶民们都满怀着高度的生产热情和信心，正继续进行生产工具与生产技术的改革，争取在近年内达到有吃有穿的地步。
