Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: American bourgeois news agency reporters are reporting with unease that more and more capitalist countries are disregarding the American "embargo" and developing trade relations with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies.

Associated Press reporter Arthur Gaver sent a dispatch from London, pointing out that many countries, including Britain, France, Argentina, Greece, Egypt, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway, have recently concluded dozens of trade agreements and temporary contracts with the Soviet Union one after another, and negotiations on concluding other trade agreements are still underway. Through these trade agreements, these countries are able to sell many commodities that cannot be sold on the capitalist world market. According to Gaver, "Allied" officials believe these trends are "of great significance."

When talking about Britain, Gaver said that although the British government is still implementing the so-called strategic embargo, it is under pressure from business circles to relax the "embargo" measures against the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China. He explained this situation by saying: "Since West Germany and Japan are competing with Britain in the British traditional market again, some manufacturers are demanding more freedom to open up new markets."

    许多资本主义国家愿意与民主阵营发展贸易
    【新华社八日讯】美国资产阶级的通讯社记者怀着不安的心情报道：越来越多的资本主义国家顾不得美国的“禁运”令，而与苏联、中国及人民民主国家发展贸易关系。
    美联社记者阿瑟·加佛向自伦敦发出一条电讯，指出英国、法国、阿根廷、希腊、埃及、丹麦、荷兰、挪威等许多国家最近相继和苏联缔结了数十个贸易协定和临时合同，目前还正在进行关于缔结其他贸易协定的谈判。通过这些贸易协定，这些国家得以售出许多在资本主义世界市场上销不掉的商品。据加佛向说，“盟国”官员们认为这些趋势是“有重大意义”的。
    加佛向在谈到英国时说，尽管英国政府还在执行所谓战略禁运，但它却受到工商界人士的压力，要求放宽对苏联、东欧及中国的“禁运”措施。他解释这种情形说：“由于西德和日本又在英国传统市场上与英国展开竞争，因此一些制造商要求更多的自由来开辟新的市场。”
