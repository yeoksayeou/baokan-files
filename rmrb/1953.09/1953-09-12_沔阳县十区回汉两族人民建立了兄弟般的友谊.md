Reader's Letters (Excerpts)

    Readers Zhu Baiyang and Xu Yixiang wrote: The tenth district of Mianyang County, Hubei Province, is an area where the Hui and Han ethnic groups live together. There are more than 500 Hui households in the district, accounting for 6% of the total number of households. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, disputes often occurred between the Hui and Han peoples. After liberation, the people's government correctly implemented the ethnic policy, and the relationship between the Hui and Han peoples has greatly improved.

    This spring, after the Hubei Provincial People's Government sent a working group to the tenth district to inspect the implementation of ethnic policies, the Mianyang County People's Government sent a special person to Hongmiao Township in the tenth district to deeply publicize ethnic policies, and the unity between the Hui and Han peoples was further strengthened. In the past, the Hui and Han peoples of Hongmiao Township rarely exchanged labor during production. Recently, the deputy township chief (Han nationality) of Hongmiao Township took the lead in exchanging labor with the Hui people and took care of the Hui people's living habits, which promoted the joint production and mutual labor exchange between the Hui and Han people. Mutual aid groups jointly organized by the Hui and Han peoples have also begun to appear in various townships.

    In June of this year, when the Hongmiao Township People's Government mobilized laborers to inspect and repair the main embankment, it happened to coincide with the Hui people's "Eid al-Adha." In order to take care of the Hui people's customs, the district people's government decided to give the Hui laborers two days off to celebrate "Eid al-Adha." The Hui people were extremely happy and specially invited Han cadres and representatives from all walks of life to participate in the celebration. The Han people sent flowers to the Hui people to congratulate them, and the celebration was filled with an atmosphere of great national unity. After the Hui laborers participating in the dike repair returned to the construction site after the holiday, their labor enthusiasm was greatly improved, and they completed seven days of work in three days.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    沔阳县十区回汉两族人民建立了兄弟般的友谊
    读者朱柏扬、徐贻湘来信：湖北沔阳县第十区是回汉两族杂居地区，全区共有五百多户回民，占总户数百分之六。在国民党反动统治时期，回汉两族人民之间时常发生纠纷。解放后，人民政府正确贯彻了民族政策，回汉两族人民的关系大大改善了。
    今年春天，湖北省人民政府派工作组到十区检查执行民族政策情况后，沔阳县人民政府又派专人到十区红庙乡深入宣传民族政策，回汉两族人民的团结更加加强了。过去红庙乡回汉两族人民之间生产时很少换工。最近红庙乡副乡长（汉族）带头与回民换工，并照顾回民的生活习惯，带动了回汉人民共同生产和串工。回汉两族人民共同组织的互助组也开始在各乡出现。
    今年六月红庙乡人民政府动员民工查修干堤时，刚好碰到回胞的“尔德节”。区人民政府为了照顾回民风俗，决定让回族民工放假两天庆祝“尔德节”。回民们高兴极了，在举行庆祝会时，特邀请了汉族干部和各界人民代表参加；汉族人民向回民送花庆贺，庆祝会中充满了民族大团结的气氛。参加修堤的回族民工在假期结束后回工地工作，劳动积极性大大提高，在三天中就完成了七天的任务。
