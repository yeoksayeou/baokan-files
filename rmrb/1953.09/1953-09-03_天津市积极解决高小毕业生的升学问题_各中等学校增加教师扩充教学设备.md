The Tianjin Municipal People's Government is actively taking measures to solve the problem of enrollment for higher primary school graduates and school-age children. On September 1, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Committee and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Committee held a joint meeting to discuss and adopt specific measures to solve this problem. It was decided to continue recruiting a batch of new students for the first year of junior high school and the first grade of primary school in some municipal primary and secondary schools around September 10, and to recruit a batch of higher primary school graduates in the newly established municipal and private intermediate cultural schools.

The unified enrollment work for secondary schools and primary schools in Tianjin was held in July, and a total of 6,527 new students were admitted to senior high schools, technical schools, and normal schools, 11,604 new students for the first year of junior high school, and 31,857 new students for the first grade of primary school. Among all the applicants, there were 12,280 students in the city who applied for junior high school and more than 12,000 school-age children who applied for primary school who were not admitted. In order to solve their schooling problems, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, after careful research, formulated the following measures based on the principle of consistency between needs and possibilities:
\tMiddle School: (1) Add 20 two-part classes in existing municipal secondary schools, which can accommodate 1,000 students. In addition to recruiting some day students from the reserve students admitted in the previous examination, some more students can be recruited. (2) Use the original site of the Workers' and Peasants' Normal School to add four municipal intermediate cultural schools, implementing a half-day class system, which can enroll about 3,000 students. This type of school is of the nature of junior high school, offering the main courses of junior high school. After graduation, students can apply for senior high school with the same academic ability. (3) Add private intermediate cultural schools, which can enroll about 4,000 students. Students pay a certain amount of tuition each semester. In order to take care of the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, workers, and the poor students, the government has a 30% semi-free quota and a 20% fully free quota. In order to solve the problem of schooling for students in Tianjin as soon as possible and the difficulty of lacking school dormitories, no boarding students are admitted. The above can enroll about 8,000 primary school graduates.
\tPrimary School: Add about 4,000 new students for the first grade of primary school in existing municipal primary schools. In order to overcome the shortage of classrooms, the existing full-day third grade will be changed to half-day, and some houses will be built as classrooms. In addition, assist private primary schools to further expand the enrollment of new students by about 1,000. It is suggested that public and private factories and enterprises expand the enrollment quota of primary schools for the children of their employees as much as possible.

In the unified enrollment in July, many students who applied for junior high school and primary school were not admitted, mainly because the people's economic life has gradually improved since liberation, and their political awareness has been continuously improved. The need for cultural education has increased year by year, and the number of students enrolled has increased sharply year by year. Judging from the situation in Tianjin, the number of primary school students enrolled in 1953 increased by 111% compared with the beginning of 1949, and the number of junior high school students enrolled in 1953 increased by 166.8% compared with the beginning of 1949. The number of senior high school students enrolled this year increased by 50% compared with last year. In order to adapt to the needs of the development of cultural and educational undertakings, the expenditure on educational construction has also increased greatly year by year. For example, the basic construction cost of secondary schools in the city alone this year reached more than 39 billion yuan. As early as May and June, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government repeatedly studied the enrollment work this year, and tried its best to tap potential and expand the enrollment quota in the existing primary and secondary schools by adding two-part systems, merging classes, expanding class quotas, and assisting private primary schools to increase classes.

Huang Huoqing, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference Committee, pointed out in his speech at the joint meeting: The People's Government has made great efforts to solve the problem of further education for primary school graduates and the enrollment of school-age children. This time, the enrollment has been expanded, and most of the primary school graduates in the city can enter higher schools, and the problem of enrollment of school-age children can also be solved to a large extent; however, it still cannot fully meet the needs of the people. This is mainly because the state's financial expenditure must be mainly used for economic construction, and secondly, there are still certain difficulties in terms of teachers. Our current educational institutions cannot train more teachers. Even if there is money and houses, it is impossible to run a school without teachers. Therefore, this temporary difficulty in the course of victory and development can only be gradually overcome with the development of economic construction. This point should be explained to the broad masses of the people in depth, and we should overcome this temporary difficulty together. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the concerted efforts and support of people from all walks of life, the current temporary difficulties can be completely overcome.

Also reported: This summer, Tianjin's secondary schools have increased a large number of administrative leading cadres and teachers, and expanded teaching equipment, which provides favorable conditions for improving teaching quality and cultivating qualified talents.

This summer, Tianjin's secondary schools have added a total of more than 270 administrative leading cadres and teachers, including 29 outstanding teachers cultivated and selected from primary and secondary schools, and a total of 240 graduates from this year's college and junior college graduates and Tianjin Normal College's accelerated training class. The teachers selected from primary and secondary schools are generally transferred to various middle schools to serve as principals and deans; the graduates of each school are assigned to various schools to engage in teaching work according to their professional knowledge, skills, and actual work needs. In addition, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government is also preparing to transfer a group of cadres with university degrees and teaching experience from various government agencies and units to work in secondary schools to meet the needs of teachers in secondary schools.

In terms of teaching equipment, the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau has purchased a large number of experimental instruments and teaching aids in physics, chemistry, biology, geography, etc., including 110 microscopes, more than 40 lunar and terrestrial operation instruments, and various teaching aids such as animal and plant industrial wall charts and globes; it has also purchased a batch of demonstration instruments for junior high schools. These instruments and teaching aids will be distributed to various schools before the start of school in accordance with the principle of general care and key distribution. In addition, 2.6 billion yuan has been distributed to various schools to purchase books according to their needs to meet the teaching needs of various schools. In order to more widely carry out sports activities and enhance the health of teachers and students, various schools have also added various sports and health equipment.

The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has also allocated 12 sets of physical, chemical, and biological instruments to middle schools in Tianjin, including various experimental instruments, models, specimens, and even working tools.

Each school has also added new classroom tables and chairs, desks, beds, and other supplies. The Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau has also given priority to allocating 28 million yuan to schools such as Tianjin No. 1 Middle School and Tianjin No. 16 Middle School for the manufacture of experimental platforms.

    天津市积极解决高小毕业生的升学问题
    各中等学校增加教师扩充教学设备
    天津市人民政府正积极采取措施，解决高小毕业生就学及学龄儿童入学问题。在九月一日天津市人民政府委员会和各界人民代表会议协商委员会举行联席会议，讨论并通过了解决这个问题的具体办法。决定于九月十日左右在市立一部分中小学续招
    一批初中一年级及小学一年级新生，并在新设的市立及私立中级文化学校招收一批高小毕业生。
    天津市中等学校及小学统一招生工作已于七月间分别举行，共录取高中、技术学校、师范学校新生六千五百二十七名，初中一年级新生一万一千六百零四名，小学一年级新生三万一千八百五十七名。在全部报考的学生中，有本市投考初中的学生一万二千二百八十名及投考小学的学龄儿童一万二千余人未被录取。天津市人民政府为了解决他们的就学问题，经过缜密研究，根据需要与可能一致的原则，拟定了如下几项措施：中学方面：（一）在现有市立中等学校增设二部制二十班，可收学生一千人，除在前次考试中录取的备取生中补取一部分走读生以外，尚可以续招一部分。（二）利用原工农师范校舍增设市立中级文化学校四所，实行半日上课制，可招收学生三千名左右。这一类的学校为初级中学性质，开设初中主要课程，学生毕业后可以同等学力投考高级中学。（三）增设私立中级文化学校，可招收学生四千名左右，学生每人每学期缴纳一定数额的学费。政府为照顾烈军工属及贫苦学生，设有百分之三十的半免费额与百分之二十的全免费额。为尽先解决天津市学生就学问题及学校宿舍缺乏的困难，一律不招收住宿生。以上可共招收小学毕业学生约八千人左右。
    小学方面：在现有市立小学增收小学一年级新生四千人左右。为克服教室不足的困难，将现有的整日制三年级改为半日制，并修建部分房屋作为教室。此外，则协助私立小学再扩大招收新生约一千人左右，建议各公私营工厂企业单位尽可能扩大职工子弟小学之招生名额。
    七月间的统一招生，有不少投考初中及小学之学生未被录取，主要原因是由于解放后人民经济生活逐步改善，政治觉悟不断提高，在文化教育方面的需要日益增长，入学人数逐年激增。就天津市情况来看，一九五三年小学入学人数较一九四九年初增加百分之一百一十一，一九五三年初中入学人数较一九四九年初增加百分之一百六十六点八。高级中学入学人数今年较去年增加了百分之五十。为适应文化教育事业发展的需要，教育建设经费亦逐年有极大的增加。如今年全市中等学校仅基本建设费用即达三百九十余亿元。天津市人民政府早在五、六月间，即反复研究过今年的招生工作，并在现有中小学中以增设二部制、并班、扩大班级名额、协助私立小学增班等办法尽可能挖掘潜力，扩大了招生名额。
    天津市各界人民代表会议协商委员会主席黄火青在联席会议上发言中指出：人民政府为了解决小学毕业生的升学及学龄儿童的入学问题，已经作了很大的努力，这一次扩大招生，全市小学毕业生大部分可以升学，学龄儿童的入学问题也可解决一大部分；但是，它还不能完全满足人民的要求，这主要是由于国家的财政开支，必须主要地用来进行经济建设，其次在师资方面，也还有一定的困难，我们现在的教育机构还不能培养出更多的师资。即使是有钱有房子，没有教员也是无法办学校。因此，这种胜利和发展途中的暂时困难，只能随着经济建设的发展而逐步加以克服。这一点，应向广大群众深入进行解释，共同渡过这一暂时的困难。我们相信：在共产党和人民政府的领导之下，在各界人士的一致努力和支持之下，目前这一暂时的困难是完全可以渡过的。
    又讯：天津市中等学校今年暑期中增加了大批行政领导干部及师资，扩充了教学设备，为提高教学质量，培养合格人才提供了有利条件。
    今年暑期，天津市中等学校增加行政领导干部和教师共二百七十余人，其中有各中小学培养选拔出来的优秀教师二十九人，和本届高等学校专科学校毕业生、天津师范学院速成班毕业生共二百四十人，各中小学选拔的教师一般被调配到各中学担任校长和教导主任工作；各校毕业学生则根据其专业知识技能和实际工作需要，分别输送到各校担任教学工作。另外，天津市人民政府还准备在各机关单位抽调一批有大学程度和教学经验的干部到中等学校工作，以适应中等学校的师资需要。
    在教学设备方面，天津市教育局购置了大批物理、化学、生物、地理等方面的实验仪器和教具，其中有显微镜一百一十架，月地运行仪四十余座，有各种动植物工业挂图，地球仪等教具；还为初级中学购置了一批示教仪器。这批仪器、教具，将按一般照顾、重点分配的原则，在开学前分发给各校。另外还分发了二十六亿元由各校根据需要购置图书以适应各校教学需要。为了更广泛地开展体育运动，增进师生健康，各校还增添了各种体育卫生设备。
    中央人民政府教育部也拨给天津市中学十二套物理、化学、生物仪器，其中包括各种实验仪器、模型、标本以至工作用具等。
    各校还新添了课室桌椅、办公桌、床铺等用具。天津市教育局还重点拨给市一中、市十六中等校各二千八百万元作制造实验台等之用。
