Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 17th: The workers in the building materials production sector of Korea are responding to Marshal Kim Il-sung's call, accelerating the restoration and increase of the production of various building materials needed in large quantities after the war. According to the planned schedule, the factories in the building materials sector will complete the basic restoration project within this year, and from next year, they will be able to produce a large number of building materials.

In the brick and tile industry, which occupies an important position, the workers are enthusiastically launching an increase production competition, and the restoration work is proceeding very quickly. Among them, the Changguang Brick Factory in Pyongyang has begun a huge repair project and large-scale production, and the daily output has exceeded the pre-war level. The workers of the Jiangjie City Pottery Factory put forward the slogan of "Rebuilding the beautiful Jiangjie City" and are changing to mechanized production. After the renovation is completed, the output of each machine can replace forty technicians. Pottery factories in Hamhung, Qingjin, and Jiangnan are adding equipment and improving production methods. It is expected that the production efficiency can be increased to two to three times the past by next year. Pottery workshops are being rebuilt in Shunchuan, Anzhou, Shariwon, Hamhung, Wonsan, Kaesong, and Jiangjie. After these workshops are completed in the spring of next year, they can produce about 100 million bricks and a large number of other building materials every year.

Factories manufacturing cement and glass in various places are also rapidly recovering. The Tiannaili Cement Factory, which has been repaired, has now started production. The huge Shenghuli Cement Factory will start production in October. Although the Nampo Glass Factory suffered serious damage during the war, it will soon be able to resume production due to the efforts of all the factory's employees.

People from all walks of life in Korea unanimously support the workers' struggle to restore construction.机关 staff and residents in many areas voluntarily participate in voluntary labor to restore and rebuild factories.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 17th: According to Pyongyang newspapers, Korean science and technology personnel who have returned from studying in the Soviet Union over the years are using the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to actively participate in the construction of the motherland and have made great contributions.

While inviting Soviet experts to teach in Korea, the Korean government has sent students to the Soviet Union every year since 1946 to study advanced science and technology. In order to meet the increasing needs of building the country, the number of students studying in the Soviet Union has increased year by year. After the previous students studying in the Soviet Union graduated, they returned to China during the war one after another to serve in Korean industrial and mining enterprises, science and education departments. They gave full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and many people established meritorious service during the war. For example, Wei Zaichun, the chief technician of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, adopted scientific design methods in the design work of restoring and constructing railways and bridges, creating a large amount of wealth for the country, and was therefore awarded the third-class national flag medal. Quan Shien, the director of the Special Treatment Department of the Medical Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Health, used and promoted advanced Soviet medical methods to cure a large number of wounded soldiers of the People's Army. Li Yuking, the deputy technician of the Shuifeng Power Plant, applied advanced Soviet technology to complete the winter bulletproof wall project during the war, ensuring production.

After the ceasefire, Korean science and technology personnel who returned from studying in the Soviet Union launched a tense work to restore and build the people's economy. In order to commend their achievements and further develop their creative talents, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party convened a meeting of more than 400 science and technology personnel who had studied in the Soviet Union in economic, cultural and other departments on September 12. At the meeting, Park Yong-bin, Minister of the Organization and Guidance Department of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, called on everyone to work hard to create and promote advanced production methods and experience, continuously improve production efficiency, and further strengthen the work of training technicians and technical personnel.

    朝鲜建筑材料工厂年内完成基本恢复工程
    留苏归国的技术人员积极参加祖国建设
    【新华社平壤十七日电】朝鲜建筑材料生产部门的工人们，响应金日成元帅的号召，正加紧恢复和增加生产战后大量需要的各种建筑材料。根据预定计划，建筑材料部门各工厂将在年内完成基本恢复工程，从明年起就可以生产大量的建筑材料。
    在占重要地位的砖瓦业中，工人们热烈展开了增产竞赛运动，恢复工作进行很快。其中，平壤市的昌光炼瓦工厂已开始进行庞大的修复工程和大规模的生产，日产量已超过战前的水平。江界市窑业工厂的工人们，提出了“重建美丽的江界市”的口号，正在改用机械进行生产。改建工作全部完成后，每台机器的生产量可代替四十名技工。咸兴、清津、江南等窑业工厂都在增添设备，改进生产方法，预计到明年可把生产效率提高到过去的两倍到三倍。顺川、安州、沙里院、咸兴、元山、开城、江界等地正在重建着窑业工场。这些工场在明春完工后，每年约可生产一万万块砖和大批其他建筑材料。
    各地制造水泥、玻璃的工厂也在迅速恢复着。已修复的天内里水泥工厂现已开始生产。规模巨大的胜湖里水泥工厂将在十月间开始生产。南浦玻璃工厂虽在战时遭受了严重的破坏，但由于全厂职工的努力修复，不久也可恢复生产。
    朝鲜各界人民一致支援工人们恢复建设的斗争。许多地区的机关工作人员和居民都自动参加恢复和重建工厂的义务劳动。
    【新华社平壤十七日电】据平壤报纸报道：历年从苏联留学归国的朝鲜科学技术人员，运用着苏联的先进经验，积极参加建设祖国的工作，作出了很大的贡献。
    朝鲜政府在邀请苏联专家来朝教学的同时，从一九四六年起每年都派遣学生去苏联学习先进的科学技术。为了适应建设国家的日益增加的需要，留苏学生的人数一年比一年多。前几期留苏学生毕业以后，已在战时先后返国，服务于朝鲜工矿企业、科学和教育等部门。他们发挥积极性和创造性，不少的人在战时建立了功勋。例如，任铁道省设计局技师长的韦在春，在恢复与建设铁道和桥梁的设计工作中，采用科学的设计方法，为国家创造了大量的财富，并因此荣获三级国旗勋章。任保健省医务局特殊治疗部部长的全时恩，利用和推广先进的苏联医疗法，治愈了大批人民军伤员。任水丰发电厂副技师长的李裕敬，应用苏联先进技术，在战时完成了冬季的防弹墙工程，保障了生产。
    停战以后，留苏归国的朝鲜科学技术人员紧张地展开了恢复建设人民经济的工作。为了表扬他们的功绩，进一步发挥他们的创造才能，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会在九月十二日召集经济、文化等部门的留苏科学技术人员四百多人举行会议。劳动党中央组织指导部部长朴永彬在会上号召大家努力创造和推广先进的生产方法和经验，不断提高生产效率，并进一步加强培养技工和技术人员的工作。到会的留苏人员一致表示感谢党和政府的培养与器重，决心把自己的精力和技术及科学知识，贡献给恢复和发展战后人民经济的伟大事业。
