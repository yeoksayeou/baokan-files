Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 3rd: The Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House continues to publish the Russian translation of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung." The third volume of the Russian translation has now been published. This volume is the second half of the Chinese version of Volume II. This is because the Chinese version of Volume II is very thick, and the publishing house could not publish it in one volume in Russian, so it was changed to the Russian version of Volume II and Volume III. Volume III includes works from the Anti-Japanese War period, from 1939 to 1941. The Foreign Languages Publishing House is currently preparing to publish the fourth volume of the Russian version of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung" (i.e., the Chinese version of Volume III), which is expected to be released at the end of 1953.

    苏联出版“毛泽东选集”俄译本第三卷
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：莫斯科外国书籍出版局继续出版“毛泽东选集”的俄译本。目前俄译本第三卷已经出版。这一卷是中文版第二卷的后半部。这是因为中文版第二卷非常厚，出版局无法用俄文本出版一册，所以改成俄文版第二卷和第三卷。第三卷包括抗日战争时期一九三九年到一九四一年的著作。外国书籍出版局目前正在准备出版俄文版“毛泽东选集”第四卷（即中文版第三卷），预计将在一九五三年年底发行。
