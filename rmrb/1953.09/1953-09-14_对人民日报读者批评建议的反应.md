Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to the People's Daily
    Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance Bureau
    Inspection of the Timber Stockpile Incident Completed
    Letter from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance Bureau: The People's Daily on June 17th carried readers' criticisms of our bureau's timber stockpile. We have conducted an inspection of this issue. Our bureau is responsible for supplying timber for the basic construction projects of all municipal government agencies and enterprises. However, due to insufficient understanding of the construction plans of various units and a lack of planning in our work, the turnover rate of our timber inventory is relatively high, often reaching around 10,000 cubic meters. Last September, among the timber we took over from the Construction Materials Company that was transferred from the Northeast, small and medium-sized timber amounted to 3,000 cubic meters. Units were unwilling to use this specification, so it was not allocated in time. This further increased the amount of stockpiled timber. Inspection has confirmed that a small amount of the stockpiled timber has begun to rot. We are now strengthening warehouse management, gaining a deeper understanding of the material requirements of each unit, and strictly managing the use of timber to reduce waste. Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration
  Determined to Improve the Quality of Coal Produced by its Mines
    Letter from the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration: The opinions of readers Jing Zhai, Liu Kai, and Guo Sheng in the "Summary of Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on August 6th are correct. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to improving coal quality, and we are now determined to improve. Zhao Gezhuang Mine and other mines under our administration have accepted users' suggestions and are paying attention to adjusting the proportion of lump and fine coal in each wagon of raw coal, and the coal quality has improved. According to our investigation, the gangue content of No. 2 raw coal from Tangjiazhuang Mine is 2 to 3 percent, exceeding the stipulated 1.5 percent. We are now trying to improve the conditions for picking gangue and promoting a reward system for picking gangue to reduce the gangue content of raw coal. At the same time, we have also decided to regularly educate employees on improving coal quality, in order to further improve the quality of raw coal from each mine.

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    北京市人民政府财政局
    对积压木材事件已作检查
    北京市人民政府财政局来信：六月十七日人民日报上，读者批评我局积压木材。我们对这个问题已进行检查。我局负责供应全北京市机关、企业基本建设工程的木材，但由于对各单位建筑工程的计划了解不够，工作还缺乏计划，因此，库存木材的周转量较大，经常达一万公尺左右。去年九月间，我们接管建筑器材公司由东北调来的木材中，中小方的达三千公尺。这种规格各单位都不愿用，所以没有及时拨出。这就更增加了库存木材的积压量。库存木材中经检查确有少数开始腐烂，我们现在正加强仓库保管工作，并深入了解各单位用料情况，严格管理木材的使用，以减少浪费。开滦煤矿总管理处
  决心提高所属各矿产煤质量
    开滦煤矿总管理处来信：八月六日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏中，读者静斋、刘楷、国盛的意见是正确的。过去我们对提高煤炭质量确实重视不够，今后决心加以改进。我矿所属赵各庄等矿现已接受用户建议，注意调整每个车皮原煤块末的比例，煤炭质量已有所提高。唐家庄矿二号原煤含矸石量，据我们调查达百分之二到百分之三，超过了百分之一点五的规定；现在正设法改善拣矸石的条件，推行拣矸石的奖励制度，以减低原煤含矸石量。同时我们还决定经常对职工进行提高煤质的教育，以期进一步改善各矿的原煤质量。
