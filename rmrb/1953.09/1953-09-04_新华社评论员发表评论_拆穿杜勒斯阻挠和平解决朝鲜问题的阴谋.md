Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: Xinhua News Agency commentator Jiang Nan published a commentary on the speech delivered by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to the U.S. Veterans of Foreign Wars convention on the 2nd, saying:

    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech on the Korean issue that was supposedly of a "foreign policy" nature. But Dulles is too far removed from normal "diplomatic" concepts; he does not proceed from facts, but from the opposite of facts, repeating a clumsy, intimidating cliché, attempting to use it to promote his policy that runs counter to peace in Korea. This approach exposes his true colors as a liar and conspirator all at once.

    Dulles, like a clown in a circus, walks upside down on his head and hands, his mouth describing a world turned upside down, a truth turned upside down. This trick, though laughable, does no good to promoting peace. He said that it was not the United States that invaded Korea, but the Korean and Chinese people who resisted the American invading army; he said that he was wholeheartedly concerned about "peace," as if he had never been to the 38th parallel to personally plot an advance into North Korea. But history cannot be tampered with, and lies do not become truths just because they are repeated many times. Syngman Rhee launched the Korean War, he refused to stop the war, and clamored for a "march north." All these facts have already become established in the world's just public opinion. No matter how the liar juggles his guns, he cannot escape the condemnation of justice throughout the world. As for Dulles' guilty conscience and his attempt to use words like "the aggressor miscalculated" to cover up his failure in military adventures in Korea, this is also completely futile; everyone knows that this sentence fits the United States perfectly. As soon as the armistice agreement was signed, the U.S. ruling group's public opinion admitted that the United States had already failed in Korea, and some newspapers even frankly pointed out that the Korean War had nothing to do with America's "security" at all, complaining that the United States had miscalculated. Even Dulles himself had to admit in his speech that some people in the American ruling group were already despondently thinking that "our (American) soldiers fought in vain in Korea."

    Dulles is trying to disguise a man-eating wolf as a benevolent old man. Although the United States has openly stated that it will station troops in South Korea for a long time and do everything possible to cultivate the battered and scarred traitor Syngman Rhee to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; according to him, the United States does not seem to want to turn Korea into its own base. If so, can the American troops stationed in South Korea hang in the air? According to Dulles, the purpose of the United States seems only to seek "unification" for the "free" Korean "people," and Dulles seems to be shedding tears of "sympathy," hoping that people will "think about the Korean people who have suffered long-term devastation." But Dulles' crocodile tears are overdone, and he completely forgot the blood shed by millions of Korean people under the various unprecedentedly cruel atrocities of the United States. His ugly appearance cannot but make all people of conscience feel disgusted and angry.

    Dulles once again trotted out the so-called "U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" and the declaration of the sixteen nations that invaded Korea, which was concocted by the United States, to make intimidating noises against the Korean and Chinese people. Not only that, Dulles also reaffirmed that if the political conference lasted for three months and did not achieve the goals of the United States, he would "suspend negotiations" and "withdraw from the conference" together with Syngman Rhee. This set of methods used by Dulles, the master of blackmail, is worthless. It only further reminds the people of the world that it is a small group of American warmongers led by Dulles who are preparing to manipulate and disrupt the political conference to obstruct peace in Korea and condone Syngman Rhee in re-igniting the war. In addition to this, Dulles' intimidation and blackmail also make the people of the world see clearly the United States' attempt to further invade Indochina. As for the Korean and Chinese people, they have already beaten back the invaders with iron fists and are vigilantly watching all anti-peace conspiracies. Even if Dulles and his ilk shout themselves hoarse to intimidate today, it will not have any effect.

    The only practical meaning of Dulles' doing this is, as he nakedly stated in his speech, to raise the value of the running dog Syngman Rhee in order to coerce America's "allies" to let the United States lead them by the nose on the Korean issue. Dulles said: "South Korea is not a puppet. It has its own will." Naturally, the reason why a running dog is a running dog is that it does indeed need to have its "will," that is, to listen attentively to its master and bark and yell at random to scare people when needed. People only need to look at the shouts of "march north" repeatedly issued by Syngman Rhee before and after the resumption of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the issue of the political conference, and it is not difficult to see Dulles' intentions at a glance.

    The duet of Dulles and Syngman Rhee has been sung from before the signing of the armistice agreement to after the signing, and it has not ended to this day. The same program was also performed at the United Nations General Assembly, which recently closed. The United States used Syngman Rhee as a "club" to beat its "allies," forcing them to accept the United States' arbitrary demands to turn the political conference into negotiations between the belligerent parties and exclude India from participating in the conference. Now, Dulles has once again stated in his speech that in order to force its "allies" to let the United States manipulate and disrupt the political conference in order to prevent the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and maintain tensions in the Far East, the United States will intensify its use of Syngman Rhee as a big stick.

    However, Dulles' trick is not a foolproof plan. Even the public opinion of some capitalist countries, including the United States, has pointed out that the United States has paid a heavy political and moral price for its arbitrary actions in the recent United Nations General Assembly. In particular, the resolution passed by the majority of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on India's participation in the political conference proves that the United States is opposed to most of the world. The fact is that Dulles' cloven hoof is being exposed in front of more and more people. Now, in the Indian and Western European bourgeois public opinion, some people have pointed out that rather than the United States having to bow to its running dog Syngman Rhee, it is the United States itself that opposes holding a round table conference and obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. An Indian newspaper said, "Washington seems prepared to disregard the united opposition of most of America's friends and allies in order to please Syngman Rhee." Of course, this is not about "pleasing" but about using Syngman Rhee as a road roller for the United States' policy of obstructing peace.

    Dulles' trick is indeed not very clever. All pretexts cannot conceal the evil conspiracy. All gullible people should open their eyes and look at the facts. All people who are willing to realistically ease international tensions and promote peace should refuse to let this kind of swindler push themselves into the abyss of disaster.

    拆穿杜勒斯阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的阴谋
    【新华社三日讯】新华社评论员江南就美国国务卿杜勒斯二日向美国退伍军人团代表大会发表的演说发表评论说：
    杜勒斯以美国国务卿的身份就朝鲜问题发表了一篇据说是属于“外交政策”性质的演说。但是杜勒斯和正常的“外交”观念离得太远了一些，他不是从事实而是从事实的反面出发，重复了一通笨拙的恫吓性的滥调，企图借此来宣扬他的与朝鲜和平背道而驰的政策。这种做法把他的说谎者、阴谋家的本来面目一下子就暴露出来了。
    杜勒斯像马戏团里的丑角一样，倒立着用头和双手来走路，他的嘴里描述着颠倒过来的世界，颠倒过来的真理。这个把戏尽管令人失笑，但是对于促进和平却毫无好处。他说侵略朝鲜的不是美国而是抵抗美国侵略军的朝中人民，他说他一心一意挂念着“和平”，好像他从来没有到过三八线来亲自策动向北朝鲜进军。但是，历史并不能窜改，谎话并不因多说几遍就可以变成真实。李承晚发动朝鲜战争，他拒绝停战，叫嚣“向北进军”。所有这些事实，都已在世界公正舆论中成了定案。说谎者不管怎样掉弄枪花，也逃不脱全世界正义的谴责。至于杜勒斯作贼心虚地想用什么“侵略者打错了算盘”的话来掩饰自己在朝鲜从事军事冒险的失败，这也完全是白费心机，人人都知道这句话安在美国身上恰恰合适。停战协定刚刚签字，美国统治集团舆论就承认美国在朝鲜已经失败，有一些报纸甚至坦白指出朝鲜战争根本与美国的“安全”无关，抱怨美国是失算了。连杜勒斯自己也不得不在他的演说里承认，美国统治集团中间的一些人已经颓丧地认为“我们（美国）在朝鲜作战的军人是白白地作战了”。
    杜勒斯企图把吃人的狼装扮成仁慈的老爹。尽管美国已经公开表明要在南朝鲜长期驻军，并竭尽一切力量来培植遍体鳞伤的走狗卖国贼李承晚，以阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决；但是据他说，美国似乎并不想把朝鲜变成自己的基地。既是这样，那么美国在南朝鲜的驻军难道可以挂在空气上面吗？根据杜勒斯所说，美国的目的似乎只是要替“自由的”朝鲜“人民”求得“统一”，杜勒斯似乎还含着一泡“同情”之泪，希望人们“替长期遭受浩劫的朝鲜人民着想”。但是杜勒斯的猫哭老鼠的把戏做得过分了一些，他完全忘记了在美国种种空前残酷的暴行之下，朝鲜千千万万人民所流的鲜血。他的丑恶形状不能不使得一切有良知的人们感到恶心和愤怒。
    杜勒斯再一次抬出了所谓“韩美共同防御条约”和美国一手制造的侵朝十六国宣言来虚声恫吓朝中人民。不仅如此，杜勒斯还再次申明如果政治会议进行了三个月而没有达到美国的目的时就要“中止谈判”并和李承晚一起“退出会议”。杜勒斯这个讹诈能手所施展的这一套手法是一文不值的。它只是进一步提醒了世界人民：准备操纵和破坏政治会议以阻挠朝鲜和平，并纵容李承晚重新挑起战争的正是以杜勒斯为首的一小撮美国战争贩子。除此以外，杜勒斯的恐吓和讹诈也叫世界人民看清楚了美国进一步对印度支那进行侵略的企图。至于朝中人民，他们已经用铁拳打退了侵略者，并正在警惕地注视一切反和平的阴谋。杜勒斯之流今天即使叫破了喉咙来进行恐吓，也是起不了任何作用的。
    杜勒斯之所以要这样做，只能有一个实际意义，如他在演说里所赤裸裸地表明了的，就是要抬高走狗李承晚的身价，用以胁迫美国的“盟国”在朝鲜问题上听任美国牵着鼻子走。杜勒斯说：“韩国并不是一个傀儡。它有它自己的意志。”自然，走狗之所以成为走狗，也的确需要有它的“意志”，这就是专心听命于它的主人而在需要的时候乱咬乱叫一通来吓唬人。人们只要看一看在讨论有关政治会议问题的联合国大会复会前后李承晚连续发出的“向北进军”的叫嚣，对杜勒斯的用心就不难一目了然。
    杜勒斯、李承晚的双簧，从停战协定签字以前唱到了签字以后，至今还没有收场。在刚刚闭幕不久的联合国大会上也公演了同一出节目。美国利用李承晚这根“棍棒”来敲打它的“盟友”，压迫它们接受美国把政治会议变成交战双方的谈判和排斥印度参加会议的专断的主张。现在，杜勒斯在演说里再次表明：为了强迫其“盟国”听任美国操纵和破坏政治会议，以阻止朝鲜问题的和平解决和维持远东紧张局势，美国将变本加厉地利用李承晚这一根大棒。
    但是，杜勒斯的这种诡计也并不是什么如意算盘。甚至包括美国在内的一些资本主义国家的舆论都指出美国由于它在最近的联合国大会中的专横行径已付出了政治上和道义上的重大代价。特别是联合国大会政治委员会多数通过印度参加政治会议的决议，证明了美国是和大部分的世界对立的。事实是，杜勒斯的马脚已经在越来越多的人的面前露出来了。现在，在印度和西欧的一些资产阶级舆论中间，都有人指出与其说美国必须向它的走狗李承晚低头，不如说美国自己反对举行圆桌会议和阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。印度的一家报纸说，“华盛顿为了取悦李承晚，似乎准备不理会美国大部分朋友和盟国的联合反对。”当然，这并不是什么“取悦”而是利用李承晚来充当美国阻挠和平的政策的辗路机。
    杜勒斯的把戏确实玩得很不高明。一切幌子都掩饰不了邪恶的阴谋。一切轻信的人应该睁开眼睛看一看事实。一切愿意实事求是地缓和国际紧张局势和促进和平的人们，应该拒绝听任这一类骗子手把自己推进灾难的深渊。
