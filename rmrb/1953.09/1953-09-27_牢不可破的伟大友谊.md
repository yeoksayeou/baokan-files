    The Government Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, left Moscow on the 25th, after holding successful talks with the Soviet government. In a statement before leaving Moscow, Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out that "the results of the negotiations will greatly contribute to further strengthening the fraternal and close relations between the Korean and Soviet peoples, and will contribute to the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the guarantee of peace and security in Asia and the world." The Chinese people and all peace-loving people of all countries express warm congratulations on this great result of the Soviet-Korean talks.
    The Korean people are now facing new and great tasks. After winning the righteous war of resistance against aggression and defense of peace, they must further strive for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on the basis of national unification, and begin the work of restoring their national economy, which has been severely damaged by the war.
      This is an arduous but sacred task. The US aggressor forces, which were defeated by the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, are still trying in every possible way to obstruct and undermine the Korean people's cause of consolidating peace, restoring the economy, and seeking unification. The Korean people must continue to defeat all its conspiracies. At the same time, the restoration and reconstruction work that the Korean people have already begun in order to further strengthen the democratic base contains such ambitious plans: they will effectively use all resources, rationally use manpower and machinery, and accelerate the training of technical personnel, so as to rapidly reach a level that creates a solid foundation for the people's lives to be improved quickly. At present, the most important thing is to seek the reconstruction of important industries and cities, and the restoration and further development of agriculture.
    There is no doubt that the Korean people are fully qualified to complete this new task. This condition is first of all the great victory won by the Korean people in the three-year war of resistance against aggression, as well as the indomitable patriotic spirit they displayed in the test of war and their indestructible unity based on the worker-peasant alliance closely around the Korean Workers' Party; it also includes the infinite and profound friendship of the great Soviet people and all progressive mankind towards the Korean people, and the international assistance that is being given to the Korean people on an ever-increasing scale.
    The people of all countries in the world cherish the great contribution of the Korean people to the peace of the Far East and the world with gratitude and pride, and regard the current new task of the Korean people as a cause closely related to their own interests.
    It is no accident that the Korean people immediately received the great sympathy and assistance from the great Soviet government and its people after the armistice was realized. The history of the Korean people's mastery of the destiny of the country is inseparable from the Soviet Union's internationalist assistance. The Soviet-Korean talks show that the friendly and cooperative relations between them have been further developed and strengthened. The Soviet Union has paid special attention to the issue of assisting the Korean people in restoring the national economy. The one billion rubles allocated by the Soviet government to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea free of charge will be used to restore and build many important peaceful industries that form the basis for Korea's development of the national economy and improvement of the people's lives; at the same time, the Soviet Union will supply Korea with equipment and materials for restoring transportation, developing agriculture, and cultural and educational welfare, as well as a large number of daily necessities for residents.
    The great Soviet Union's friendly assistance to the Korean people is profound and selfless. When the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, G.M. Malenkov, hosted a banquet for the Government Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on September 19, he said: "The friendship between the people of our two countries is built on mutual respect for the sovereignty and independence of our two countries, and on the determination of both sides to strive for the consolidation of peace and international security. This means that this friendship can be further consolidated and developed." When the Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Il-sung, spoke about the great assistance from the Soviet Union at the banquet, he said: "This assistance will also consolidate the friendship between the Korean and Soviet peoples, consolidate our worker-peasant alliance, and provide new contributions to the cause of peacefully resolving the Korean issue, peacefully unifying our motherland, and ensuring peace and security in Asia."
    Obviously, the friendship and assistance of the countries in the peace, democracy and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union to the Korean people will be strengthened day by day. In particular, the Chinese people, who fought side by side with the Korean people to jointly resist aggression and defend peace and whose blood has condensed into an indestructible friendship with the Korean people, will continue to carry out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, support the Korean people in restoring national unity and completing reconstruction work.
    The slogans of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference celebrating the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China vividly reflect the feelings of the Chinese people. The slogans say:
   "Celebrate the great victory of the Korean armistice! The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a great victory for the Korean and Chinese people against the US war of aggression, a great victory for the peace and democracy camp's adherence to the policy of peacefully resolving the Korean issue, and a great victory for the people of all countries' demand for negotiated solutions to international disputes. Strive for the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement! Strive for the speedy convening of the political conference and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue!"
    "Salute the heroic Korean people! Congratulate the Korean people on their great victory in the struggle against US aggression and defending the independence of their motherland! Wish the Korean people new victories in the cause of restoring and developing the national economy and striving for the peaceful reunification of their motherland! Long live the close unity and friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!"
    "Commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers! Resolutely abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement, heighten vigilance, hold your positions, prevent any aggression and sabotage activities from the enemy, and strive to ensure the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue!"
    "The people of the whole country should make concerted efforts to continue to deepen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, do a good job in providing preferential treatment, support the Chinese People's Volunteers, strive for the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, strive for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and assist the Korean people in carrying out restoration work!"
    The Chinese people firmly believe that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, with the fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the Korean people will overcome all difficulties and obstacles and victoriously complete the task of rapidly restoring and developing the national economy, improving the material welfare of the people, and further strengthening the material foundation for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, just as they have achieved victory in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad.
    The primary task now is to further consolidate and expand this indestructible friendship and unity.
    The people of Asia and the Pacific are increasingly aware that Chairman Malenkov's statement at the Kremlin banquet that "objective conditions enable the progressive social forces of the East to turn Asia into a fortress of peace" is a glorious task. We must take on this task with a hundred times the courage. The aggressive plans of the reactionary and aggressive forces headed by the United States to undermine the political conference and continue to maintain world tension are being carried out blatantly. They used the majority vote machine in the General Committee of the Eighth UN General Assembly to reject the proposal of Vyshinsky, the head of the Soviet delegation, to include the discussion of expanding the membership of the political conference on the agenda. US news agencies began to promote the active construction of the so-called "strong new defense line across Korea" by the US invading troops in South Korea, and stepped up the training and equipment of the Syngman Rhee army. They are stepping up their bets on Yoshida, Chiang Kai-shek, Bao Dai and other anti-people scum to plot new Far East war conspiracies.
    However, it can be asserted that the reactionary and aggressive forces' carrying out of these dirty deeds will only make them drill deeper into a dead end. History is developing completely contrary to their reactionary dreams. As long as the people of Asia and the Pacific become more vigilant and unite, the conspiracies of the reactionary and aggressive forces will be thoroughly bankrupt.
    The indestructible friendship between the great Soviet people and the Chinese and Korean people has formed a strong fortress of peace. We must continue to expand and consolidate it and make more and greater contributions to the peace of the Far East and the world.

### 牢不可破的伟大友谊

    牢不可破的伟大友谊
    以金日成首相为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团，在和苏联政府之间举行了完满的会谈之后，已于二十五日离开了莫斯科。金日成首相在离开莫斯科前发表的谈话中，指出“谈判的结果将大大地有助于进一步加强朝鲜人民和苏联人民之间的兄弟般的亲密关系，并将有助于和平解决朝鲜问题和保证亚洲及世界的和平与安全。”中国人民和一切爱好和平的各国人民，对于苏朝两国会谈的这一巨大结果，表示热烈的庆贺。
    朝鲜人民现正面临着新的伟大任务。他们要在正义的反抗侵略保卫和平战争获得胜利后，进一步争取在全国统一的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题，并开始进行恢复其遭受战争严重破坏的国民经济的工作。
      这是艰巨的而又是神圣的任务。被朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军所击退的美方侵略势力，仍在千方百计地企图阻挠和破坏朝鲜人民巩固和平、恢复经济与谋求统一的事业。朝鲜人民必须继续打败它的一切阴谋计划。同时，朝鲜人民为更加加强民主基地而业已开始的恢复与重建工作，包含着这样的远大计划：他们将有效地运用一切资源，合理地使用人力和机械，加速技术人员的训练，使经济迅速达到一个水平，以创造人民生活得以很快提高的稳固基础。目前最重要的是谋求重要工业和城市的重建，和农业的恢复及其进一步的发展。
    毫无疑问，朝鲜人民是完全有条件来完成他们这个新的任务的。这种条件，首先是朝鲜人民在三年反侵略战争中所取得的伟大胜利，以及他们在战争考验中所显示的刚毅的爱国精神和他们紧密地围绕在朝鲜劳动党周围的以工农联盟为基础的不可摧毁的团结力量；同时也包括伟大苏联人民及全体进步人类对朝鲜人民所怀抱的无限深厚的友谊，和正以越来越大的规模给予朝鲜人民的国际援助。
    世界各国人民怀着感激与骄傲的心情，珍视朝鲜人民对远东及世界和平所作的伟大贡献，并把朝鲜人民当前的新任务视为与自己的利益密切相关的事业。
    朝鲜人民在停战实现之后，立刻得到了伟大苏联政府及其人民的巨大同情与援助，并不是偶然的。朝鲜人民掌握国家的命运的历史，就是和苏联的国际主义援助分不开的。苏朝两国的会谈，显示它们之间的友好合作关系有了进一步的发展和加强。苏联并特别注意了援助朝鲜人民恢复国民经济的问题。苏联政府无代价地拨给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的十亿卢布，将用于恢复与建筑许多作为朝鲜发展国民经济和提高人民生活的基础的重要和平工业；同时苏联将供给朝鲜用于恢复交通、发展农业和文教福利事业的设备和器材，以及大量的居民日用必需品。
    伟大的苏联对朝鲜人民的这种友谊援助是深厚的、无私的。苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫在九月十九日设宴招待朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团时说：“我们两国人民的友谊建筑在互相尊重我们两国的主权和独立的基础上，建筑在双方决心为巩固和平与国际安全而奋斗的基础上。这就是说，这种友谊完全可以得到进一步的巩固和发展”。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成在宴会上谈到苏联的伟大援助时说：“这些帮助同时将巩固朝苏两国人民的友谊，巩固我国的工农联盟，并对和平解决朝鲜问题、和平统一我们祖国及保证亚洲和平与安全的事业提供新的贡献”。
    显然地，以苏联为首的和平民主与社会主义阵营各国，对于朝鲜人民的友谊援助将日益加强。特别是为了共同反抗侵略保卫和平而与朝鲜人民并肩作战、以自己的鲜血和朝鲜人民凝结成牢不可破的友谊的中国人民，将继续进行抗美援朝运动，支持朝鲜人民恢复国家统一和完成重建工作。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年的口号，生动地反映了中国人民的心情。口号说：
   “庆祝朝鲜停战的伟大胜利！朝鲜停战协定的签订，是朝中人民反对美国侵略战争的伟大胜利，是和平民主阵营坚持和平解决朝鲜问题的政策的伟大胜利，是各国人民要求协商解决国际争端的主张的伟大胜利。争取朝鲜停战协定的彻底实施！争取政治会议的迅速召开和朝鲜问题的和平解决！”
    “向英雄的朝鲜人民致敬！祝贺朝鲜人民反对美国侵略、保卫祖国独立斗争的伟大胜利！祝朝鲜人民在恢复和发展国民经济及争取祖国和平统一的事业中得到新的胜利！中朝两国人民的亲密团结和友谊万岁！”
    “中国人民志愿军的指挥员和战斗员们！坚决遵守朝鲜停战协定，提高警惕，坚守阵地，防止敌人方面的任何侵袭和破坏活动，为保障朝鲜停战协定的彻底实施、争取朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗！”
    “全国人民一致努力，继续深入抗美援朝运动，做好优抚工作，支持中国人民志愿军，争取朝鲜停战协定的彻底实施，争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，援助朝鲜人民进行恢复工作！”
    中国人民深信，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家的兄弟般的援助下，必将克服一切困难和障碍，胜利地完成尽速恢复和发展国民经济、提高人民的物质福利和进一步加强和平统一祖国的物质基础的任务，就像他们在对国内外敌人进行斗争中取得了胜利一样。
    现在的头等任务，就是要把这个牢不可破的友谊和团结力量进一步巩固和扩大起来。
    亚洲和太平洋各国人民正在越来越深刻地认识到，马林科夫主席在克里姆林宫的宴会上所说的“客观条件使东方的进步社会力量可以把亚洲变成和平堡垒”是一个光荣的任务。我们必须百倍英勇地把这个任务担当起来。以美国为首的反动侵略势力企图破坏政治会议并继续保持世界紧张局势的侵略计划，正在露骨地进行着。它们在八届联大总务委员会以多数票表决机器否决了苏联代表团团长维辛斯基所提出的把讨论扩大政治会议成员问题列入议程的建议。美国通讯社开始宣传美国侵朝军队在南朝鲜积极建筑所谓“强有力的横跨朝鲜的新防线”，并加紧训练和装备李承晚军队。它们加紧地把策划新的远东战争阴谋的赌注押在吉田、蒋介石、保大及其他反人民的渣滓上。
    但是，可以断言，反动侵略势力进行这些龌龊勾当，只有使它们自己向着死角钻得更深。历史是完全违反它们的反动梦想发展的。只要亚洲及太平洋各国人民进一步警惕起来，团结起来，反动侵略势力的阴谋计划一定会遭到彻底的破产。
    伟大的苏联人民和中朝人民的牢不可破的友谊，已经形成了强大的和平堡垒，我们一定要把它继续扩大和巩固起来，对远东与世界的和平作更多更大的贡献。
