    Qin Tianxiang Punished for Interfering with Freedom of Marriage

    A letter from the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CCP Jingdezhen Municipal Committee: Regarding the issue of "Qin Tianxiang, former manager of Jingdezhen Porcelain Coating Company, should not have interfered with Wang Guanyi's freedom of marriage," published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column of the People's Daily on May 15th, we have already taken action. Qin Tianxiang received a public admonishment within the Party and a demerit on the administrative side; Pan Zhiying received an administrative admonishment, and it is recommended that the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League also take disciplinary action; Zhu Qingshu, Qian Huiying, and Jiang Guanghe of the Jingdezhen Municipal People's Court, wrote written self-criticisms. The unreasonable marriage agreement between Wang Guanyi and Fang Mingquan has been dissolved with the approval of the People's Court.
