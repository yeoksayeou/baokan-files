Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: The imperialist countries, headed by the United States, manipulated the United Nations Security Council and refused to discuss the issue of France's brutal interference in the Moroccan situation, which was raised by fifteen Asian and Arab countries. This act of hostility towards the colonial people's desire for national independence has aroused strong dissatisfaction in Arab and Asian public opinion.

During the Security Council's discussion, the Associated Press sent a telegram from Cairo saying: "The attitude of the United States and Britain on the Moroccan issue has aroused strong anti-Western sentiment throughout the Arab world. Arab newspapers have been criticizing Western imperialism. Even in little Transjordan, newspapers have expressed public indignation and launched a campaign against France, Britain, and the United States."

The Malayan newspaper "The Vanguard" also criticized the attitude of the United States on September 2nd. The newspaper said that the United States' support for colonialism has become a habit, providing not only spiritual assistance but also material assistance. "The actions taken by the U.S. and British governments should be a lesson to people everywhere struggling for freedom." The newspaper continued: "'Voice of America' broadcasts in more than forty languages that the United States is a warrior of the 'free world.' But in reality, the United States has been following a policy of creating hatred among millions of people. Morocco is just one example."

The United States' obstruction of the Security Council's discussion of the Moroccan issue has provoked such a strong reaction that even the reactionary Scripps-Howard newspaper chain in the United States has expressed concern. The editorial in this newspaper chain said that this attitude of the United States, in addition to alienating the African and Asian groups, will also alienate many small countries. By doing so, the United States will "find that it has no support."

Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: According to TASS, New York, September 4th: At the United Nations Security Council meeting on September 3rd, the discussion on the request of fifteen countries to include the Moroccan issue on the Security Council's agenda was concluded, and votes were taken on various proposals.

The representatives of the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Chile voted in favor of inviting representatives from thirteen non-Security Council member states out of the fifteen countries to participate in the discussion. The representatives of the United States, Britain, France, Denmark, and Colombia voted against.

Next, a vote was taken on the proposal by the Lebanese representative to allow the thirteen countries to send two representatives to speak at the Security Council. The representatives of the United States, Britain, France, Denmark, and Colombia voted against, while the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Lebanon, Chile, and Greece voted in favor of this proposal.

After this, a vote was taken on the proposal by the fifteen countries to include the Moroccan issue on the Security Council's agenda. The Soviet Union, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Chile voted in favor, while the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, Denmark, and Colombia voted against, and the Greek representative abstained.

None of the above proposals were passed in the Security Council because seven votes were required for passage. The colonial powers of the United States, Britain, and France thus prevented the Security Council from discussing the Moroccan issue.

    美、英、法等殖民国家阻止安理会讨论摩洛哥问题
    阿拉伯及亚洲国家舆论强烈表示不满
    【新华社五日讯】以美国为首的帝国主义国家操纵联合国安全理事会，拒绝讨论亚洲及阿拉伯集团十五国所提出的法国横暴干涉摩洛哥局势问题。这种敌视殖民地人民民族独立愿望的行为，已引起阿拉伯及亚洲国家舆论的强烈不满。
    在安理会讨论过程中，美联社就从开罗发出电讯说：“美国和英国在摩洛哥问题上所持的态度，已引起了整个阿拉伯世界的强烈反对西方的情绪。阿拉伯的报纸已对西方帝国主义进行抨击。甚至在小小的外约旦，报纸也表达了民众的愤慨情绪，发动了反对法国、英国和美国的运动。”
    马来亚报纸“时代先锋报”在九月二日也抨击美国的态度。该报说，美国支持殖民主义已经成为惯例，除了给予精神上的援助以外，还给予物质的援助。“美国和英国政府所采取的行动，对各地为争取自由而斗争的人民来说，应当是一个教训。”该报接着说：“‘美国之音’用四十几种语言大事广播说，美国是‘自由世界’的战士。但是实际上，美国一直遵循着在千百万人民中制造仇恨的政策。摩洛哥只是一个例子而已。”
    美国阻止安理会讨论摩洛哥问题引起如此猛烈的反应，使得美国反动的斯克里浦斯—霍华德系报纸也发出担心的言论。该系报纸的社论中说，美国这种态度除了使得美国疏远非洲及亚洲集团外，还要疏远许多小国家。美国这样做，将“发现美国是没有人支持的”。
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社纽约四日讯：联合国安全理事会在九月三日的会议上，结束了关于十五国要求把摩洛哥问题列入安理会议程的讨论，并对各项建议进行表决。
    苏联、巴基斯坦、黎巴嫩和智利代表投票赞成邀请十五国中十三个非安理会理事国的代表参加讨论。美国、英国、法国、丹麦和哥伦比亚代表投票反对。
    接着，就黎巴嫩代表提出的允许十三国推派两个代表在安理会上发言的建议进行表决。美国、英国、法国、丹麦和哥伦比亚代表投票反对，苏联、巴基斯坦、黎巴嫩、智利和希腊投票赞成这一建议。
    在这以后，对十五国要求把摩洛哥问题列入安理会议程的建议进行表决。苏联、巴基斯坦、黎巴嫩、智利投赞成票，美国、英国、法国、丹麦和哥伦比亚代表投反对票，希腊代表弃权。
    上述各项建议在安理会上都没有得到通过，因为必需有七票赞成才能通过。美国、英国和法国诸殖民国家就这样阻止了安理会讨论摩洛哥问题。
