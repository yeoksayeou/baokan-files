    Guarding American POWs Not Directly Repatriated
    Indian Soldiers Enter New Camp in Boksan-ri
    (Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 23) Two hundred soldiers from the Indian Rajputana Rifles Regiment, who will be responsible for guarding South Korean and non-Korean POWs who will not be directly repatriated, entered their new camp in Boksan-ri on the afternoon of the 23rd. They were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Karan.
    Boksan-ri is located in the northern half of the demilitarized zone, about half a mile west of Panmunjom. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have built many dormitories and other houses here for the Indian troops to use. The dormitories are made of wood, with walls plastered with two or three inches of stucco. This will help the Indian troops keep warm in the upcoming harsh winter. The POW camp for POWs not directly repatriated is located in the nearby village of Songjwa-dong, and these POWs will arrive on the 24th. The POW camp covers an area of 40,000 square meters and is located in a beautiful area full of chestnut and fruit trees. The newly built dining hall and dormitories in the POW camp are spacious, with each house being 90 feet long and 20 feet wide. In addition, there are dozens of Korean huts for the POWs to live in, with heated platforms (炕). Sports equipment includes two basketball courts, a parallel bar, and a horizontal bar. There is a hospital nearby to serve the POWs.

    看管不直接遣返的美方战俘
    印度士兵开入钵山里新营房
    【新华社开城二十三日电】将要负责看管不直接遣返的南朝鲜战俘和非朝鲜籍战俘的印度拉杰浦塔纳步枪团的二百名士兵，于二十三日下午开入在钵山里的新营房。他们是由卡兰中校指挥的。
    钵山里位于非军事区的北半部，在板门店以西约半英里的地方。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军已在这里建筑了许多宿舍和其他房屋供印度部队使用。宿舍是用木头盖的，室内墙壁上涂有两三英寸厚的灰泥。这使印度部队在即将到来的严冬中可以御寒。供不直接遣返的战俘居住的战俘营设在附近的松左洞村庄中，这些战俘将于二十四日到达。这个战俘营占地四万平方公尺，地点幽美，遍地是栗子树和果木树。战俘营的新建的饭厅和宿舍都很宽敞，每一个房子都是长九十英尺，宽二十英尺。此外并有几十间朝鲜小屋供战俘居住，屋中有炕。运动设备包括两个篮球场，一个双杠，一个单杠。附近有一所为战俘服务的医院。
