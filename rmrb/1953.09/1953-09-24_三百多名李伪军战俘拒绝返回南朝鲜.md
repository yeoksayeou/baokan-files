Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 23rd. Many Rhee Syngman soldier POWs have requested to remain in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In the spirit of respecting the POWs' right to repatriation and allowing them to return to their homes, the Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly tried to persuade them. However, more than 330 people have expressed their refusal to return to South Korea for various reasons.

    A POW surnamed Jin told reporters about his life in South Korea. He said that he never wore a complete set of clothes from childhood until he was fifteen years old. He was naked in the summer and froze in the winter, hiding in his house and crying. Under the rule of the Rhee Syngman reactionary regime, the only small cow in his family was also taken away by the Rhee Syngman soldiers. The harvest of one year's farming was not enough to pay rent and taxes. Every year, from the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, there was nothing to eat, so they had to grind bean leaves into powder and cook it into a thin soup to fill their stomachs until the following spring when they could dig wild vegetables from the newly green mountains to survive. However, the Rhee Syngman gang's persecution of his family did not stop there. In September 1950, the Rhee Syngman gang also grabbed him to be cannon fodder.

    When the Korean-Chinese side personnel persuaded him to return to South Korea, this young man, who had suffered countless hardships, couldn't help but shed tears. He said: "Can I go back to live that hellish life again? I never dreamed that I would be able to study, but now I have reached the second grade of junior high school. The food I eat here, I have never eaten before. In 1952, I visited a rural village in the northern part of the Republic. I personally visited an old lady. She said that before the land reform, her family was still a hired laborer, but now she has three cows, a sewing machine, and a large cabinet full of clothes. From that time on, I made up my mind: I must stay in the Republic and work hard. I would rather die than leave the embrace of the Republic again!"

    A Rhee Syngman soldier POW surnamed Yin also refused to return to South Korea. He expressed his hatred for the Rhee Syngman gang's traitorous policies and the atrocities of the American invading army in South Korea. He said: "I used to serve in the US 24th Division, and the atrocities of the US military that I have seen alone are difficult to describe. When the US military retreated, they burned down the entire Icheon Township in Icheon County, Gyeonggi Province, which was my home. When I ran back home, the house had already turned into a pile of rubble, and there were blackened corpses around the house. My mother was crying there. As soon as she saw me, she asked: 'Why did these Americans set the fire?' In Yangpyeong County, Gyeonggi Province, American beasts raped Korean women in front of us. I also personally saw a company of the US 24th Division dismantle the houses of the common people one by one to use as firewood. I will never forget all of this." He went on to say that after he was captured, he saw that a Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier broke a Korean villager's jar, and the soldier specifically went to the villager's house to apologize and compensate. He said: "I can now see very clearly who are the friends and enemies of the Korean people."

    三百多名李伪军战俘拒绝返回南朝鲜
    【新华社开城二十三日电】许多李伪军战俘要求留在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，朝中方面本着尊重战俘遣返权利及让战俘重返家园的原则，曾多次地向他们进行劝说，结果仍有三百三十多人因各自不同的理由表示拒绝回到南朝鲜。
    一个姓金的战俘向记者叙述了他在南朝鲜的生活。他说，他从小到十五岁就没有穿过一件完整的衣服，夏天裸着身子，冬天冻得躲在屋子里哭。在李承晚反动政权统治下，他家里仅有的一条小牛，也被李伪军抢走了。种一年地的收获还不够交租和纳税。每年从阴历十一月就没有东西吃，只好把豆叶磨成粉，煮成稀汤充饥，直到来年春天才能从刚刚发青的山上挖取野菜糊口。但是，李承晚匪帮对他一家人的迫害还不止此，一九五零年九月李匪帮又把他抓去当炮灰。
    当朝中方面人员劝他回到南朝鲜去时，这个曾经受过无数困苦的青年不禁流下了眼泪。他说：“我还能再回去过那地狱一般的生活吗？我过去连做梦也想不到会能读书，可是现在我已经达到初中二年级的程度了。我在这里吃到的饭菜，从前一次也没有吃过。一九五二年，我曾经到共和国北部的一个农村里去参观。我亲自访问过一个老大娘。她说，土地改革前她家里还是一个雇工，可是现在她已经有三条牛、一个缝纫机和一个装满衣裳的大柜子了。从那时起，我就下了决心：我一定要留在共和国好好工作。我死也不愿再离开共和国的怀抱！”
    一个姓尹的李伪军战俘也不愿再回南朝鲜，他表示痛恨李承晚匪帮的卖国政策和美国侵略军在南朝鲜奸淫烧杀的兽行。他说：“我曾经在美军第二十四师当过兵，仅仅我所见到的美军暴行就难以说尽。美军败退时把京畿道的利川郡利川邑全部放火烧光了，那地方正是我的家。我跑回家里时，家里房子早已变成了一片瓦砾，在房子周围还有一个个已经烧黑的尸体，我母亲正在那里痛哭。她一见我就问：‘这些美国人为什么要放火呢？’在京畿道杨平郡，美国兽兵当着我们的面强奸朝鲜妇女。我还亲眼看到美军第二十四师一个连队把老百姓的房子一间间拆开来当柴烧。这一切我都永远不会忘记。”他接着说，他在被俘后见到：一位中国人民志愿军战士把一个朝鲜老乡的罐子打破了，那个战士特地到老乡家去道歉和赔偿。他说：“谁是朝鲜人民的朋友和敌人，我已经可以看得很清楚了。”
