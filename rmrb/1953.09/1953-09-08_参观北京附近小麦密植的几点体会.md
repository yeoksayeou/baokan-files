Some Experiences from Visiting Wheat Close Planting near Beijing
Liu Ding'an, Director of the Agricultural Administration Department of the Ministry of Agriculture
Wang Shou, Director of the Grain Production Department of the Ministry of Agriculture

Recently, we successively participated in wheat close planting observation and discussion meetings held by the State-owned Shuangqiao Farm, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, Beijing Agricultural University, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, and the State-owned Wulidian Farm. We observed the growth of closely planted wheat in these units and listened to the opinions of agricultural experts, working cadres, and model laborers on wheat close planting. We have the following insights on the issue of wheat close planting:

First, wheat close planting is an effective way to increase production at present. We have personally seen that all wheat fields implementing close planting have achieved significant production increases. For example, the State-owned Shuangqiao Farm planted closely planted wheat with a row spacing of 4.5 inches last year, yielding an average of 260 catties per mu, while sparsely planted wheat with a row spacing of 1 foot 3.5 inches yielded only 138 catties per mu. The cultivation conditions were completely the same in both areas, and the production increased by 88% simply due to the implementation of close planting. This year, the farm adopted three different close planting methods for further close planting cultivation: row spacing of 7.5 centimeters (equivalent to 2.25 inches), 15 centimeters (equivalent to 4.5 inches), and 15 centimeters cross-seeding. As a result, 280 mu of wheat yielded an average of 344.24 catties per mu, an increase of 88.8% compared to the farm's average of 182.3 catties per mu last year, and more than twice the wheat yield of local farmers. The closely planted wheat at Beijing Agricultural University, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and the State-owned Wulidian Farm also proved that closely planted wheat yields much higher than sparsely planted wheat by local farmers under the same cultivation conditions.

Second, the main reasons for wheat lodging and chlorosis are not close planting. Many people believe that wheat close planting can increase production, but they worry that poor ventilation and light penetration after close planting will easily lead to lodging and chlorosis. Some even cite examples of lodging and diseases caused by other reasons to oppose close planting. After several observation and discussion meetings, everyone agreed that lodging and chlorosis are closely related to poor varieties and improper fertilization and irrigation techniques. For example, the high-yield land of Gongwangsi Farm of Agricultural University grows No. 3 and No. 6 wheat varieties of Agricultural University, which are resistant to chlorosis and have stiff stalks that are not prone to lodging. Although close planting with a row spacing of 15 centimeters was used and more fertilizer was applied, there was no lodging or disease infection. Other wheat varieties in the variety comparison field near this high-yield land, although the row spacing was twice as wide (more than 30 centimeters) and less fertilizer was applied, suffered from lodging and disease infection. The State-owned Shuangqiao Farm and Wulidian Farm both grow the Yanda 1885 variety of wheat. The Shuangqiao Farm used close planting with a row spacing of 7.5 centimeters and 15 centimeters cross-seeding, and there was no lodging at all; the wheat planted with a row spacing of 15 centimeters at the Wulidian Farm lodged a lot due to poor management. It can be seen that the reason for lodging is not close planting, but mainly due to poor varieties and fertilization management and other techniques.

Third, appropriate close planting is feasible under the existing conditions of the masses. During the discussion meeting at Shuangqiao Farm, the model laborers who participated in the discussion believed that close planting could definitely increase production, but they had the following questions: Can dry land and thin land be closely planted? How to closely plant without new planters? According to the results of dry land close planting at Agricultural University, these questions were answered. The Lugouqiao Farm of the university has 62.9 mu of dry land wheat with poor soil quality. All of it was cultivated with old-fashioned plows (some used double plows to plow to a depth of five or six inches, and some were not deeply ploughed), the amount of fertilizer applied was not more than that of local farmers, and the seeds used were also local farmer varieties. The only difference was that they planted with a row spacing of 15 centimeters (equivalent to 4.5 inches) and sowed 20 to 24 catties of seeds per mu. As a result, the average yield per mu was 254 catties, and the worst piece of land also yielded 233 catties per mu, while local farmers who sparsely planted with a row spacing of 1 foot 7 inches only yielded 131 catties per mu. Regarding the relationship between close planting and soil moisture, the Lugouqiao Farm of the university also conducted a preliminary investigation. According to measurements taken during the driest period, the soil in the closely planted wheat field was only dry to a depth of one inch, while the soil in the sparsely planted wheat field was dry to a depth of more than two inches. This fact proves that close planting not only does not consume more water in the soil, but also reduces evaporation. It can be seen that dry land and thin land can also be appropriately closely planted. As for agricultural implements, they are not a reason to hinder close planting. For example, Agricultural University does not have tractors and new planters. Their closely planted wheat is planted using the farmer's single-legged drill and double-legged drill (double drills), and the results are very good. These facts prove that close planting can also be implemented with old-fashioned agricultural implements. Regarding the question of whether intercropping can be done with closely planted wheat, we also found a preliminary answer when we visited the intercropped wheat in Baipenyao Village in the suburbs. Under the leadership of the Li Zonghe Agricultural Production Cooperative, the villagers made various close planting experiments using old agricultural implements on the basis of the original wide rows, and intercropped corn, peanuts and other crops in these close planting experimental fields, and they all grew very well.

    参观北京附近小麦密植的几点体会
    中央农业部农政司司长  刘定安
    中央农业部粮食生产司司长  王绶
    最近我们先后参加了国营双桥农场、华北农业科学研究所、北京农业大学、北京市农林局及国营五里店农场所召开的小麦密植观摩座谈会，实地观察了这些单位密植小麦的生长情况，听取了农业专家、工作干部和劳动模范对小麦密植的意见。我们对小麦密植问题得到下面几点体会：
    一、小麦密植是当前行之有效的增产办法。我们亲眼看到，所有实行密植的麦田，都获得了显著增产成效。例如国营双桥农场，去年种植的行距四点五寸的密植小麦，每亩平均收二百六十斤，而行距一尺三点五寸的稀植小麦，每亩只收一百三十八斤，两地栽培条件完全相同，仅仅由于实行了密植，便增产百分之八十八。今年该场又采用行距七点五公分（合二点二五寸）、十五公分（合四点五寸）和十五公分交叉播种三种不同密植办法，作进一步密植栽培，结果二百八十亩小麦，每亩平均产麦三百四十四点二四斤，较去年该场每亩平均一百八十二点三斤，又提高了百分之八十八点八，高于当地农民的小麦产量两倍多。北京农业大学、华北农业科学研究所及国营五里店农场的密植小麦也都同样证明：密植小麦产量比当地农民在同样耕作条件下稀植的都高的多。
    二、小麦倒伏和生黄疸的主要原因不是密植。很多人认为小麦密植能增产，但担心密植后通风透光不好，容易倒伏和生黄疸。有的还把由于其他原因所造成的倒伏和病害的例子拿来反对密植。经过几次观摩座谈，大家一致认为：倒伏和黄疸是与品种不好，施肥和灌水技术不当等密切关连的。如农业大学恭王寺农场丰产地，种的是抗黄疸和秆硬不易倒伏的农大三号和六号品种小麦，虽然用行距十五公分的密植，并施用了较多肥料，既没有倒伏也没有感染病害。这块丰产地近旁的品种比较试验地里的其他品种的小麦，虽然行距宽了一倍（三十公分以上），并且施肥较少，但倒伏和感染病害的却很多。国营双桥农场和五里店农场都种的是燕大一八八五品种小麦，双桥农场用行距七点五公分及十五公分交叉播种密植的毫无倒伏；五里店农场用十五公分行距播种的小麦，由于管理不善却倒伏了不少。可见倒伏的原因不是密植，主要是由于品种和施肥管理等技术不良所致。
    三、在群众现有条件下，适当密植是可行的。在双桥农场座谈时，参加座谈的劳动模范认为密植肯定是可以增产的，但是他们有下面这样一些疑问：旱地薄地能不能密植？没有新式播种机如何密植？根据农业大学的旱地密植结果：这些问题得到了解答。该校芦沟桥农场有六十二点九亩土质不好的旱地小麦，全部用旧式犁耕地（有的用套犁办法耕深到五、六寸，有的并未耕深），施肥量不比当地一般农民多，种籽也用的是当地的农家品种，所不同的，是他们播种的行距是十五公分（合四寸半），每亩下种籽二十斤至二十四斤，结果每亩平均收麦二百五十四斤，最坏的一块地每亩也收了二百三十三斤，当地农民用一尺七寸行距稀植的，每亩只收一百三十一斤。至于密植和土壤水分的关系，该校芦沟桥农场也作了初步调查，据在最干旱时候的测定：密植麦田土壤只干到一寸多，而稀植麦田反而干到二寸多。这一事实证明了密植不仅不会多消耗土壤中的水分，反而可以减少蒸发。由此可见，旱地、薄地也可以适当密植。至于农具也不是阻碍密植的一个理由。如农业大学没拖拉机和新式播种机，他们的密植麦就是用农民的独腿耧及双脚耧的插耧
    （套耧）办法播种的，效果都很好。这些事实证明，用旧式农具也是可以实行密植的。关于密植小麦能不能间作问题，我们在参观郊区白盆窑村的间作小麦时，也找到初步的答案。该村在李宗和农业生产合作社带头下，全村群众都在原来宽行基础上，利用旧农具，作了各种密植试验，并且在这些密植试验田中，间种了玉米、花生等作物，生长都很好。
