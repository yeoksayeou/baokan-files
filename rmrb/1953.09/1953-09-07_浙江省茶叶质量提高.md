Zhejiang Province has completed its tea picking and processing work, and both tea production and quality have improved compared to last year. Although this year's spring tea was affected by natural disasters such as frost and ice, tea farmers paid attention to tea garden management, so most areas were able to maintain last year's production levels, and some areas even increased production by about 3 percent; summer tea also generally increased in production. In terms of quality, both spring and summer teas have improved significantly compared to last year. For example, Xinchang County only produced 81 dan of Grade 1 and 2 spring Mao Green Tea last year, while this year's Grade 1 and 2 spring Mao Green Tea reached 4,323 dan. In Pujiang County, Grade 1 to 3 black tea increased by 51 percent compared to last year.

This year, leaders at all levels generally attached importance to leading tea production, actively guiding tea farmers to organize themselves into cooperative tea-making groups on the basis of existing mutual aid and cooperation, and helping to solve the difficulties in tea-making. Each county convened meetings of tea farmer representatives to conduct political education for tea farmers and introduce advanced production technologies to enable farmers to produce good tea. When purchasing tea, each purchasing station also set up tea stoves at the purchasing locations and invited technicians to provide processing guidance. As a result, many farmers learned and improved their tea-making skills and improved the quality of their tea.

    浙江省茶叶质量提高
    浙江省采制茶叶的工作已结束，茶叶产量和质量都比去年提高。今年春茶虽受霜、冰等自然灾害影响，但由于茶农注意了茶园管理，大部地区仍能维持去年产量，部分地区还比去年增产百分之三左右；夏茶也普遍增产。质量方面，春茶、夏茶都比去年提高很多，如新昌县去年只产一、二级的春毛绿茶八十一担，今年一、二级的春毛绿茶达四千三百二十三担，浦江县今年一到三级的红茶，比去年增加百分之五十一。
    今年各级领导普遍重视了对茶叶生产的领导工作，积极领导茶农在原有互助合作基础上，组织起来合作制茶，帮助解决制茶存在的困难。各县都曾召开茶农代表会议，向茶农进行政治教育和介绍先进生产技术，使农民生产好茶。在收购茶叶时，各收购站还在收购地点设了茶灶，请技工进行加工指导，因此，很多农民学习和改进了制茶技术，提高了茶叶的品质。
