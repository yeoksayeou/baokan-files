Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 29th: This morning, two more Korean People's Army prisoners of war and one Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war returned to Panmunjom from the Indian custodial camp. Yu Changxin (transliteration), one of the two returning Korean People's Army personnel, told the members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, Indian officers, and news reporters after arriving at Panmunjom: "The Syngman Rhee agents in the camp ordered us to prepare to rush out of the camp on a large scale when the Indian army asked us to go to listen to the explanations. Those agents told us that if the Indian officers and soldiers tried to stop us, we should kill them."

Yu Changxin was forced by the agents to serve as the patrol leader, responsible for closely monitoring the prisoners of war. He said, "In order to prevent the prisoners of war from expressing their desire to go home, the agents forbade them from contacting the Indian guards. In our camp, apart from the Syngman Rhee agents, the vast majority of people were eager for the explanation work to begin so that they could have a chance to go home."

Yu Changxin crossed the barbed wire on the evening of the 27th and escaped the control of the agents. He unwrapped the bandage on his swollen left arm to show everyone the tattoo he had desperately tried to dig out.

Including the sixty-five Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war repatriated the day before yesterday, a total of one hundred and one Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have requested repatriation before the explanation work has even begun.

    我方被俘人员又有三名从印度看管营归来
    余昌新揭露美李特务图谋在解释开始时强迫战俘冲出营场
    【新华社开城二十九日电】二十九日上午又有两名朝鲜人民军被俘人员和一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员从印度看管营回到板门店。回来的两名朝鲜人民军人员之一余昌新（译音）在到达板门店后告诉中立国遣返委员会委员、印度军官和新闻记者说：“在营场里的李承晚特务命令我们准备在印度军队要我们去听解释时，便大规模冲出营场。那些特务告诉我们说，如果印度军官和士兵想要制止我们的话，就把他们杀死。”
    余昌新被特务们强迫担任巡逻队队长，负责严密监视战俘。他说，“特务们为了制止战俘表示他们回家的愿望，禁止他们和印度卫兵接触。在我们的营场里，除了李承晚特务之外，绝大多数人是渴望解释工作开始，以便他们能有机会回家。”
    余昌新在二十七日晚上越过了铁丝网，摆脱了特务的控制。他把发肿的左臂上的绷带解下来，让大家看看他曾经极力要挖掉的刺字。
    连前天遣返的六十五名中国人民志愿军被俘人员在内，在解释工作尚未开始之前就要求遣返的朝中被俘人员总共已有一百零一名。
