[Report from this newspaper] Since last winter, various regions across the country have actively engaged in farmland irrigation construction and improved irrigation management. This work has already achieved great success. Although some areas experienced drought in the spring and summer seasons, all farmland irrigation projects have played a significant role in ensuring increased grain production.

Since last winter, the Northeast region has actively implemented drought prevention measures such as well digging and canal construction in the historically drought-prone provinces of Liaoxi and Rehe, as well as southern Heilongjiang and western Jilin. Currently, over 12,000 water wells have been dug, over 40,000 old wells have been repaired, over 4,700 waterwheels have been added, and over 1,500 canals have been opened, benefiting a total of over 100,000 hectares of farmland. In the North China, Northwest China, and Henan and Shandong provinces, irrigation has greatly developed: over 16,000 small canals have been constructed, over 60,000 water wells have been dug, and 120,000 waterwheels have been loaned out. This year, Hebei province has drilled over 14,000 cone wells, expanding the irrigated area.

The southern rice-producing areas universally launched farmland irrigation construction movements last winter and this spring. In the East China, Central South, and Southwest regions, over 640,000 small irrigation projects such as canals, ponds, dams, and culverts were built. The Southwest region added and repaired over 4,000 waterwheels. Hunan and Jiangxi provinces built 1,070 small reservoirs, improving the irrigation and drainage conditions of 42 million mu of paddy fields and expanding part of the irrigated area. After experiencing a drought last year, the Hubei Provincial People's Government issued 180 billion yuan in relief funds to provide work relief and help farmers build irrigation projects, gradually eliminating the threat of drought. It has now completed over 68,000 small ponds and dams, and 339 large and medium-sized valley reservoirs and diversion dams, benefiting 2.8 million mu of farmland.

In order to adapt to the shallow river levels this year, the Ningxia Provincial People's Government has specifically allocated funds to lengthen the diversion dams of the Tanglai, Hanyan, and Huinong canals, and built temporary dams on the Qin Canal to increase the canal's water intake. Within the irrigation area, a rotational irrigation system and a moderate shallow irrigation method were implemented to save water. For cultivated land that was slightly higher and could not be easily irrigated, water was lifted and irrigated using water buckets and other tools. Therefore, not only was it guaranteed that all the land in the irrigation area was fully irrigated, but the irrigated area was also expanded by 50,000 mu. Major canals in the Suiyuan province have carried out measures such as clearing diversion channels and building temporary dams to improve the water intake of the canals. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the temporary dam project at the head of the Yihe Canal was quickly built, introducing 60% more water than planned, ensuring the water use of over 300,000 mu of cultivated land in Wuyuan and Anbei counties. The Huangyang Sluice, which controls an irrigation area of 1.2 million mu, experienced extreme difficulties in water intake due to siltation of the diversion channel. Based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, old ships were converted into channel head guidance and diversion equipment, increasing the water intake by about 20% and preventing some sediment from entering the channel, initially overcoming the difficulties in water intake. This is the first application of diversion equipment in our country. This successful experience will be of great help to water diversion on rivers with high sediment content in the future. In addition, all available natural water sources were utilized for irrigation in various places.

Due to the construction of farmland irrigation projects and the improvement of irrigation management, the irrigated area has been expanded, overcoming the threat of drought in some areas and playing a significant role in increasing grain production. In the Yuncheng area of ​​Shanxi, wheat field irrigation was carried out this year for the first time in areas that had never irrigated wheat before, increasing wheat yields. Shaanxi province vigorously promoted winter and spring irrigation. State-operated canals irrigated 710,000 mu in winter, an increase of 81% compared to previous years, and irrigated over 500,000 mu in spring. Various private canals irrigated over 500,000 mu of land in winter and spring, playing a significant role in increasing wheat yields. The wheat yield per mu in most wheat fields in the Jinghui Canal and Luohui Canal irrigation areas exceeded 300 jin. Winter irrigation was carried out in all irrigation areas of Ningxia province, and spring wheat generally had a bumper harvest. The average wheat yield per mu in Lingwu and Pingluo counties reached 270 jin, and the wheat yield per mu in Zhongning and Jinji counties exceeded 300 jin. The Hexi region of Gansu province also achieved a bumper harvest due to the construction of farmland irrigation projects. The wheat yield per mu in Wuwei county was around 150 jin to 220 jin, an increase of more than 10% compared to last year. The Northeast region's 1.2 million hectares of spring wheat increased by about 10% compared to last year, Sichuan province's main rice crop increased by about 10%, the Dongting Lake area of ​​Hunan province increased by 10% to 20%, and western Hunan increased by 15% to 20%.

    全国各地兴修农田水利
    对克服旱灾、增产粮食起了显著的作用
    【本报讯】全国各地自从去年冬季以来，积极兴修农田水利，改进灌溉管理。这一工作现已获得很大成绩。春、夏两季部分地区曾发生旱象，所有农田水利工程，在保障粮食增产方面，都发挥了显著的功效。
    东北区自去年冬季开始，在历年受着干旱威胁的辽西、热河两省和黑龙江省南部、吉林省西部，积极进行打井、开渠等防旱措施。现在已打成一万二千多眼水井，修理了四万多眼旧井，添置了四千七百多部水车，开了一千五百多条渠道，受益农田面积共有十万多垧。在华北、西北两区和河南、山东两省，灌溉事业有很大发展：兴修了一万六千多条小型渠道，打了六万多眼水井，贷出了十二万部水车。河北省今年锥井一万四千多眼，扩大了灌溉面积。
    南方水稻产区，去冬今春普遍开展了兴修农田水利运动。华东、中南、西南三区兴修了小型渠道、塘、坝、涵闸等水利工程六十四万多处，西南区添置和整修了四千多架筒车，湖南、江西两省建筑了一千零七十座小型水库，改进了四千二百万亩稻田的灌溉排水情况，并扩大了部分灌溉面积。湖北省在去年发生旱灾以后，人民政府发出一千八百亿元的救济经费，以工代赈，帮助农民兴修水利，逐步消除了旱灾威胁，现已完成小型塘坝六万八千多处，大中型山谷水库、拦水坝等工程三百三十九处，受益农田面积达二百八十万亩。
    宁夏省人民政府为适应今年河道水浅的情况，特拨出经费，加长了唐徕、汉延、惠农等大渠的挑水坝，在秦渠上修建临时拦河坝，以增加渠道进水量。在灌区内，实行了轮灌制度和适量浅灌的办法以节省用水，对于地势稍高引不上水的耕地，则用水斗、水桶等工具提水灌田，因此不但保证了灌区所有土地全部灌上了水，并扩大了五万亩田的灌溉面积。绥远省各大渠道都进行了清挖引水渠道和修筑临时坝等措施，改进渠道进水情况。在苏联专家的指导下，迅速筑成义和渠首临时拦河坝工程，引进了多于预定百分之六十的水量，保证了五原、安北两县三十多万亩耕地的用水。控制一百二十万亩灌溉面积的黄杨闸，由于泥沙淤积引水渠道，进水极感困难，根据苏联专家的建议，用旧船改装成渠首引向导流设备，增加了百分之二十左右的进水量，并收到防止一部分泥沙进入渠道的作用，初步克服了引水困难。这是导流设备在我国第一次应用，这一成功经验，对今后在含沙较多的河流上引水，将有很大帮助。此外，各地并利用了一切可以利用的自然水源进行灌溉。
    各地由于农田水利工程的兴修，灌溉管理工作的改善，扩大了灌溉面积，克服了一些地区的旱灾威胁，对粮食增产起了很大的作用。山西运城一带，一向不浇灌小麦的地区，今年开始进行了麦田灌溉，提高了小麦产量。陕西省大力提倡冬春灌溉，各国营渠道冬灌七十一万亩，比往年增加百分之八十一，并春灌五十多万亩。各民营渠道冬春两季灌田五十万亩以上，对于提高小麦产量起了不小的作用。泾惠渠和洛惠渠灌区的大部分麦田，每亩小麦产量超过三百斤。宁夏省全部灌区都进行了冬季灌溉，春小麦普遍丰收。灵武、平罗等县每亩小麦平均产量达二百七十斤，中宁、金积两县每亩小麦产量达三百多斤。甘肃省河西地区也因兴修农田水利，得到丰收。武威县小麦每亩产量在一百五十斤到二百二十斤左右，比去年增产一成以上。东北区一百二十万垧春小麦比去年增产一成左右，四川省大部水稻约增产一成，湖南省沿洞庭湖地区增产一成到二成，湘西增产一成半到二成。
