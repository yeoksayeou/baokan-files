    China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Xi'an Purchasing and Supply Station
    Assists Xi'an Hand Weaving Industry to Improve Product Quality
    The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Xi'an Purchasing and Supply Station is actively assisting the Xi'an hand weaving industry to improve product quality and produce novel patterned cloth to meet the needs of the broad masses in urban and rural areas.
    The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Xi'an Purchasing and Supply Station, based on the future development of industry and agriculture in the Northwest and the different needs of urban and rural consumers in the Northwest region, believes that if the Xi'an hand weaving industry improves product quality, reduces costs, and produces new varieties, it can find a market in rural areas. In order to help the Xi'an hand weaving industry solve production difficulties, produce new varieties, improve quality, and expand sales, the station organized labor and management representatives from Xi'an hand weaving factories in June this year to visit hand weaving factories in Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, and other places to learn about production techniques and operating methods. After the visit, the factories' confidence in management greatly increased. They all examined the shortcomings of past processed varieties and colors and actively improved production equipment. Now, 14.1% of the looms processing for the station have been converted to electric motor production, and all processing looms have been appropriately adjusted to move towards specialized production.
    In order to welcome the peak season after the autumn harvest and meet the needs of the broad masses, especially the peasants, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Xi'an Purchasing and Supply Station has expanded the cotton cloth processing plan for the hand weaving industry in the third quarter by 33%. In addition, to take care of some factories with relatively difficult capital turnover, the station also lent an appropriate amount of cotton yarn; the People's Bank will also grant an appropriate amount of production funds as appropriate.
    Starting in August, various hand weaving factories in Xi'an have begun to produce six varieties that could not be produced in the past, such as youth striped cloth, worker-peasant striped cloth, March 8th plaid cloth, and colored plaid serge, as well as dozens of novel patterns. These six kinds of cloth have been initially trial-woven successfully, with a total of more than fifty colors. Among them, the quality of March 8th plaid cloth and youth striped cloth has caught up with the quality of products from Suzhou and other places; the cost of individual varieties is even lower than the products from Suzhou and other places. The first batch of more than 1,000 bolts of patterned cloth was delivered to the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Xi'an Purchasing and Supply Station in mid-August according to the contract and will soon be on the market.

    中国花纱布公司西安采购供应站
    协助西安手工织布业提高产品质量
    中国花纱布公司西安采购供应站，积极协助西安手工织布业，提高产品质量，生产新颖花布，满足城乡广大群众的需要。
    中国花纱布公司西安采购供应站，根据今后西北工、农业的发展，西北区城乡消费者需要的不同特点，认为西安手工织布业如果提高产品质量，降低成本，生产新的品种，是可以在农村中找到销路的。为帮助西安手工织布业解决生产中的困难，生产新的品种，提高质量扩大销路，该站于今年六月份曾组织西安手工织布业工厂的劳资代表，去无锡、常州、苏州等地参观手工织布厂生产技术与操作方法。参观后各厂经营信心大大提高，都检查了过去加工品种、色泽等的缺点，积极改进生产设备。现在给该站加工的织机已有百分之十四点一改为电机生产，并对全部加工织机作了适当调整，以便走向专业生产。
    为迎接秋收后旺季，满足广大群众，特别是农民的需要，中国花纱布公司西安采购供应站，把第三季度对手工织布业的棉布加工计划扩大了百分之三十三。另外，为照顾部分资金周转比较困难的工厂，该站并借给适当数量的棉纱；人民银行也将酌情贷给适量的生产资金。
    八月份起，西安市各手工织布业工厂已开始生产过去不能生产的青年条布、工农条布、三八格布、彩格哔叽等六种品种，数十种新颖的花样。这六种布已初步试织成功，一共有五十多种花色。其中三八格布、青年条布的质量都赶上了苏州等地产品的质量；个别品种的成本比苏州等地的产品还低。第一批一千多匹花布，已于八月中旬按合同交给中国花纱布公司西安采购供应站，不久即可应市。
