    Bumper Harvest of Various Crops in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area
    Farmers Actively Save Grain Money to Purchase Farm Tools to Prepare for Expanded Production Next Year
    This year, various crops in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area have achieved a universal bumper harvest.
    After the completion of the first phase of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the Party and People's Government of the Flood Diversion Area, on the one hand, led the masses to continue to complete the second phase of the project, and on the other hand, vigorously led and assisted the 180,000 people in the Flood Diversion Area to carry out production and construction. In order to adapt to the flood season, the masses in the Flood Diversion Area sowed a large amount of summer-harvested crops such as barley, wheat, broad beans, and rapeseed in the autumn and winter of last year, and the sown area increased by more than double compared with previous years, accounting for 80% of the total cultivated area. Thanks to careful cultivation, increased fertilization, and the role of organization, the Flood Diversion Area achieved a bumper harvest this summer. The yield per unit area increased by 10% compared with last year, and the total output increased by more than double compared with last year. This spring, the Flood Diversion Area also planted early-maturing crops that could be harvested before the major flood in paddy and dry fields. These early-maturing crops were harvested before the end of July. The yield per unit area of early rice increased by more than 10% compared with last year. After mid-August, the whole area entered the autumn harvest, and autumn harvest crops also increased in production generally compared with last year. The yield of intermediate rice is generally 400 to 500 catties per mu. The masses in the Buhe safety zone harvested as much as 676 catties of sorghum per mu. According to the estimation of the masses, sesame can be harvested at one dan per mu, and soybeans can be harvested at 300 catties. Many five-member households harvested about 100 dan of early and mid-season rice this year, with an average of about 20 dan of grain per person. Some people said: This year's harvest is enough to eat for two years.
    The masses in Guanxi Township, Douhu Dyke safety zone, said: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, there are three good things: the People's Government is doing a good job in flood diversion, the safety zone dykes are well-built, and the production is well-led." This represents the feelings of everyone in the flood diversion area.
    After achieving a bumper harvest this year, the masses in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area are actively saving and storing grain money, purchasing farm tools and waterwheels, and plowing paddy and dry fields to prepare for expanding production and striving for a bumper harvest next year. The masses in the Buhe area alone have deposited 270 million yuan in the bank and 50,000 catties of broad beans.

    荆江分洪区各种农作物普遍丰收
    农民纷纷节约粮款添置农具为明年扩大生产准备条件
    荆江分洪区今年各种农作物普遍丰收。
    荆江分洪工程第一期工程完成后，分洪区党、人民政府就一面领导群众继续完成第二期工程，一面大力领导和协助分洪区十八万群众进行生产建设。为了适应分洪季节，分洪区群众在去年秋冬大量播种了大麦、小麦、蚕豆、菜子等夏收作物，播种面积比往年增加了一倍以上，占总耕地面积百分之八十。由于耕作仔细，施肥加多，并发挥了组织起来的作用，分洪区取得了今年夏季的丰收，单位面积产量比去年增加了一成，总产量要比去年增加一倍以上。今年春天，分洪区水旱田又种了大汛前能收割的早熟作物，这些早熟作物已在七月底以前收获完毕，早稻单位面积产量要比去年增加一成以上。八月中旬以后，全区进入秋收，秋收作物也比去年普遍增产，中稻产量一般的每亩可收四百到五百斤。埠河安全区的群众高粱最多的每亩收到六百七十六斤。据群众的估计，芝麻每亩可收到一石，黄豆可收到三百斤。很多五口之家的户，今年收的早稻、中稻就有一百石左右，平均每人有二十石左右的谷，有的群众说：今年收一年可以吃两年。
    阧湖堤安全区关西乡的群众说：“在毛主席领导下有三好：人民政府对分洪搞得好，安全区堤修得好，生产领导得好。”这代表了分洪区每个人的心情。
    荆江分洪区群众取得今年丰收后，正积极节约与储存粮款，添置农具、水车，翻耕水旱田，为明年扩大生产争取丰收准备条件。仅埠河区群众就在银行存款二亿七千万元，蚕豆五万斤。
