    李平一上校在战俘遣返委员会九月三日会议上
    要美方遣返全部坚持遣返的我方被俘人员
    【新华社开城三日电】九月三日战俘遣返委员会举行会议。朝中方面首席委员李平一上校将包括朴相显等二百四十九名朝鲜人民军被俘人员及包括吴成德等一百五十二名中国人民志愿军被俘人员的名单提交联合国军方面。这些朝中被俘人员是坚持遣返而联合国军方面企图予以强迫扣留的朝中被俘人员的一部分。李平一上校要求联合国军方面遵守停战协定的规定，履行联合国军方面在九月二日战俘遣返委员会上关于在九月六日或九月六日以前将一切坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员全部遣返完毕的诺言，把今天朝中方面所提名单中列举的人员连同其他联合国军方面企图强迫扣留的所有坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员在九月六日或九月六日以前全部遣返给朝中方面。
    在九月三日的战俘遣返委员会上，李平一上校并抗议联合国军方面参加遣俘工作的警卫人员和工作人员最近竟连续以石头、罐头盒、旧皮靴等打伤遣返中的朝中被俘人员乃至于参加遣俘工作的朝中工作人员。李平一上校要求联合国军方面采取严厉措施来制止这种挑衅性的野蛮行动，以保证类似事件今后不再发生。
