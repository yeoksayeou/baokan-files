Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 26th – The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission decided on the 25th to postpone and extend for five days the deadline originally set for September 26th for the start of explanation work and visits for POWs not directly repatriated, changing it to October 1st. The Korean-Chinese side has agreed.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 26th – Special correspondent of this agency reports: The explanation work for POWs not directly repatriated, originally scheduled to begin on September 26th, will be postponed for five days and will begin on October 1st. This is clearly the result of the US side obstructing with absurd suggestions regarding the explanation work. Signs indicate that the US side is attempting to continue delaying the start of the explanation work in order to achieve its goal of sabotaging and obstructing the explanation work.

According to reports from American news agencies, Hamblen, commander of the US repatriation group, declared that he agreed to a five-day postponement, and he also stated that he would not object if the explanation work continued to be postponed. He told American reporters: "The Allied forces are not in a hurry to carry out the explanation work." Hamblen also demanded that the five days of postponement be deducted from the ninety-day period for explaining to the POWs. According to Hamblen's plan, the longer the start of the explanation work is delayed, the shorter the period for explaining to the POWs, the fewer opportunities for the POWs to express their desire to be repatriated, and the more POWs the US side can forcibly detain.

Hamblen put forward yet another extremely unreasonable demand, supposedly based on the Armistice Agreement. However, the Armistice Agreement clearly does not provide any basis for Hamblen's unreasonable demand. Article 8 of the Annex "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" of the Armistice Agreement stipulates that the explanation work should be carried out within ninety days from the date the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over the POWs. Now, although the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has taken over all the POWs, the explanation work has not been able to start immediately due to the obstruction of the US side. Therefore, the ninety-day period should obviously be counted from the start of the explanation work, which is fully in line with the spirit of the principle stipulated in Article 1 of the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" to "ensure that all POWs have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice." Hamblen's unreasonable demand, coupled with his absurd suggestions for the explanation work, thoroughly exposes his sinister conspiracy to deprive the POWs of their right to repatriation.

    对不直接遣返战俘的解释工作和访问
    我方同意推迟并顺延五天进行
    迹象显示美方企图继续拖延解释工作的开始
    【新华社开城二十六日电】中立国遣返委员会二十五日决定，将原规定于九月二十六日开始的对不直接遣返战俘进行解释工作和访问的期限推迟并顺延五天，改在十月一日开始。朝中方面已予同意。
    【新华社开城二十六日电】本社特派记者报道：原定在九月二十六日开始的对不直接遣返的战俘进行的解释工作，将延期五天，到十月一日开始进行。这显然是美方用关于解释工作的荒谬建议进行阻挠的结果。迹象显示：美方企图继续拖延解释工作的开始，以便达到其破坏和阻挠解释工作的目的。
    据美国通讯社报道：美方遣返组司令汉布伦宣称，他同意延期五天，他同时表示，如果解释工作继续延期，他也不反对。他向美国记者们说：“联军方面不急于进行解释工作。”汉布伦还要求把延期的五天从对战俘进行解释工作的九十天期限中扣去。按照汉布伦的打算，解释工作的开始越是拖延得久，向战俘进行解释的期限就越短，战俘表达他们要求遣返的愿望的机会就越少，而美方强迫扣留的战俘也就越多。
    汉布伦提出这又一个极端无理的要求，据说是根据停战协定的。但是停战协定显然没有替汉布伦这种无理要求提供任何根据。停战协定附件“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第八款规定，解释工作应在中立国遣返委员会接管战俘之日起的九十天之内进行。现在中立国遣返委员会虽然已经接管了全部战俘，但是解释工作由于美方的阻挠，并没有能够同时立即开始。因此，九十天的期限显然应该从解释工作开始时算起，这是完全符合于“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第一款中“保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利”这一原则规定的精神的。汉布伦的这个无理要求，加上他对解释工作的荒谬建议，彻底暴露了他企图剥夺战俘遣返权利的罪恶阴谋。
