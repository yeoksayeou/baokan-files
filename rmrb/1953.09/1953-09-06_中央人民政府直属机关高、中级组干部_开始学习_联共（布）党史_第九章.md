	High and Mid-Level Cadres of Central People's Government Directly Subordinate Organs
	Begin Studying Chapter Nine of "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union"
	High and mid-level cadres of various units directly under the Central People's Government have completed the first eight chapters of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" and began studying Chapter Nine in late August.

	This theoretical study in central units is organized according to the principle of voluntarism. With the exception of a very small number who did not participate in the study due to old age or illness, a total of 60,228 cadres voluntarily signed up for theoretical study.

	Based on the current study situation of cadres in various organs directly under the Central People's Government, the following problems still exist:

	First, there is a tendency for grade assignment to be too high. According to statistics, 2,292 people participated in the advanced group, accounting for 3.8 percent of the total number of students; 42,025 people participated in the intermediate group, accounting for 69.78 percent; and 15,911 people participated in the elementary group, accounting for 26.42 percent. When studying the book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," there were originally 1,347 people in the advanced group, but now there are 945 more than in the past; the number of people in the intermediate group has increased even more, while the number of people participating in the elementary group has decreased significantly. This has created a phenomenon of high level assignment. For example, the advanced group of the Ministry of Light Industry originally had 34 people, but now it has increased to 65 people (some of whom have very poor theoretical foundations and are not suitable for participating in the advanced group); of the 485 cadres participating in the study in the Ministry of Forestry, only 12 are in the elementary group. Some units do not even have an elementary group at all. This phenomenon of grade assignment being too high affects the learning effect.

	Second, there is a phenomenon of spontaneous development in learning. Judging from the recent study of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union," only a few units, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Culture, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, have tightened their grip on leadership and can still adhere to the collective study system. The leading comrades of the ministries have generally made mobilization reports to the advanced groups, reviewed past studies, and re-stipulated the time for collective study. Most units, using the excuse of being busy with work, cannot adhere to the study system, resulting in a relaxation. A few units, due to the lack of a leadership core, cannot adhere to the study system and have completely fallen into a spontaneous development phenomenon where no one is responsible. The experience of six units of the Central Ministry of Culture shows that in order to prevent the phenomenon of spontaneous development in advanced group study, the principal leader must be responsible, a core group must be established to strengthen leadership, and necessary inspections must be carried out with a focus on promoting conscious learning in order to maintain the study.

	Third, regarding the issue of the organs' Party committees leading theoretical instructors. According to preliminary statistics, nearly 200 theoretical instructors are ready to give lectures in various units, accounting for approximately 40 percent of the graduates of the training courses for theoretical instructors and counselors in the central-level organs. The Party committees of many organs are actively strengthening their leadership over them, encouraging them to give lectures boldly, and at the same time specifically helping them prepare lessons carefully in order to improve teaching quality. For example, the Central Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and other units have established lecturer groups under the leadership of the Party committee; some units have established study rooms or teaching and research offices so that teachers can collectively study teaching outlines, unify answers to difficult questions, and summarize teaching experience. However, the Party committees of a few units have not given specific leadership to the theoretical instructors, but have dispersed the theoretical instructors to various departments and bureaus, which are controlled by the Party branches, for instruction. Therefore, it is often difficult to guarantee teaching quality, and a phenomenon of spontaneous development has occurred.

	The theoretical study of the elementary groups directly under the Central People's Government has also begun. The leadership generally formulated a plan to complete the "Reader on Common Knowledge of Economic Construction" in one to one and a half years. A few units' elementary groups study the Reader on Political Common Sense and the Basic Issues of the Chinese Revolution. The issue of elementary group teachers has been largely resolved by various units. The State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Heavy Industry and other units have mobilized by leading comrades, requiring everyone to treat learning with a realistic attitude, and introduced the learning content. However, some cadres participating in the elementary group study are not very enthusiastic. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the leadership has not formulated a practical plan for the elementary group study and has not seriously mobilized and organized lectures.

### 中央人民政府直属机关高、中级组干部  开始学习“联共（布）党史”第九章

    中央人民政府直属机关高、中级组干部
    开始学习“联共（布）党史”第九章
    中央人民政府直属机关各单位高、中级组干部，已学完“联共（布）党史”前八章，从八月下旬起开始学习第九章。
    中央各单位这次理论学习，是按照自愿原则组织起来的。除极少部分因年龄较大或生病未参加学习外，自愿报名参加理论学习的干部共六万零二百二十八人。
    从目前中央人民政府直属各机关干部的学习情况看来，尚存在以下几个问题：
    第一，编级中有偏高现象。据统计，参加高级组的有二千二百九十二人，占学习人数的百分之三点八；中级组四万二千零二十五人，占百分之六十九点七八；初级组一万五千九百十一人，占百分之二十六点四二。高级组在学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书时，原有一千三百四十七人，而现在较过去增加九百四十五人；中级组的人数增加更多，而参加初级组的人数则大为减少。这样就形成编级偏高的现象。例如轻工业部高级组原有三十四人，现增至六十五人（其中有个别干部理论基础很差，不适于参加高级组）；林业部参加学习的干部共四百八十五人，初级组仅有十二人。有的单位甚至根本没有初级组。这种编级偏高的现象，影响了学习效果。
    第二，学习中有自流现象。就最近学习“联共
    （布）党史”的情况看，只有少数单位如中央人民政府外交部、对外贸易部、文化部、内务部等领导方面抓的较紧，尚能坚持集体学习制度。部的领导同志一般都向高级组作了学习动员报告，检查了过去的学习，并重新规定了集体学习的时间。大多数单位多藉口业务忙，不能坚持学习制度，产生了松懈现象。有个别单位由于缺乏领导核心，不能坚持学习制度，已完全陷于无人负责的自流现象。中央文化部六个单位的经验说明，要防止高级组学习中的自流现象，必须首长负责，建立核心组加强领导，并在提倡自觉学习的基础上，有重点地进行必要的检查，才能使学习坚持下来。
    第三，关于机关党委对理论教员的领导问题。据初步统计，各单位准备担任讲课的理论教员已有近二百名，约占中央一级机关理论教员、辅导员训练班毕业学员的百分之四十。许多机关的党委正积极加强对他们的领导，鼓励他们大胆讲课，同时具体地帮助他们认真备课，以提高教学质量。例如，中央对外贸易部，中央邮电部等单位，在党委领导下建立了讲师团；有些单位建立了学习室或教学研究室，使教员能集体研究讲授提纲，统一解答疑难问题，总结教学经验。但有少数单位的党委，对理论教员未加具体领导，把理论教员分散到各司、局，由各党支部掌握，进行传授。因此，往往很难保证教学质量，而且产生了自流现象。
    中央人民政府直属机关初级组的理论学习，也已开始。领导方面一般都制订了计划，准备以一年到一年半的时间学完“经济建设常识读本”。少数单位的初级组学习政治常识读本和中国革命的基本问题。初级组的教员问题，各单位大体都已解决。国家计划委员会、重工业部等单位已由领导同志进行了动员，要求大家用实事求是的态度来对待学习，并介绍了学习内容。但有些单位参加初级组学习的干部，情绪不很高。形成这种现象的原因，主要是领导方面对初级组的学习没有拟定切实可行的计划，未认真进行动员和组织讲课。
