Correcting Erroneous Views on Planned Management
    Learning to Manage Enterprises with Scientific Methods
    Xu Xing, Deputy Director of the Central South Branch of the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration

    In the past four years, the non-ferrous metal factories and mines in the Central South region have basically completed political reforms, and there has been great progress in enterprise management in general. However, judging from the requirements of the country's overall economic construction, especially the Five-Year Economic Construction Plan that began this year, our work is far from meeting the needs of the new situation. At present, the problems existing in various factories and mines are numerous and very serious. The first is that several major products have not completed their production tasks for the first half of this year. Some factories and mines have completed their tasks, but as a result of overtime rushes and increased labor intensity for workers. Low work efficiency and low equipment utilization rates are common phenomena in various factories and mines. In the second half of last year, Soviet experts pointed out that the Shuikoushan Mining Bureau's Third Factory still had 24 to 42 percent of its potential untapped, and the factory's equipment utilization rate was only 28 percent. In addition, high material consumption, untimely supply, high costs, and other shortcomings are serious and common.

    Why are there so many serious problems in production? The most fundamental reason is that management is lagging behind production. The scale of production has expanded, and the enthusiasm of the masses has increased; however, management work has not kept up with the needs of the new situation, and planned management has not been well established in factories and mines. Most of our factory and mine leaders come from rural areas, or have just been transferred to factories and mines from rural areas. They are unfamiliar with the knowledge of using planned management as a scientific method to manage modern enterprises. Some even have incorrect views on planned management and have ideological resistance to accepting this scientific management method, resulting in the relaxation of planned management and the implementation of operation plans under various pretexts. For example:

    Some factory and mine leaders emphasize "conditions," believing that their enterprises have poor political conditions, weak cadre strength, and chaotic work, and therefore cannot implement operation plans or implement planned management. These comrades do not understand that implementing operation plans can create conditions for the normal development of enterprise management; nor do they understand that operation plans are the central link in strengthening planned management, and that doing this work well can gradually improve other work in the enterprise. Therefore, the more unfavorable the conditions in a factory or mine, and the more chaotic the work, the more necessary it is to focus on operation plans. In the first half of the year, the Xikuangshan Mining Bureau transferred more than a hundred technical cadres to support national capital construction. At that time, the bureau's leaders believed that the strength of technical cadres had been weakened too much, which would affect the work. However, later, in the implementation of planned management, the professional level of cadres was improved, and production was brought into line, so they felt that the existing technical cadres were able to do the work well. Similarly, the material warehouse of the Shuikoushan Mining Bureau's First Factory was originally very chaotic and clamored for too few cadres; but after implementing planned management and rectifying the work of the sections, this chaotic phenomenon was completely reversed.

    Some mine leaders say that planned management can be carried out in factories, but mines rely on the weather, and the sand output from the working faces is sometimes good and sometimes bad, and the conditions of each working face are different, and no one can control it, so how can planned management be implemented and operation plans be promoted? I think this statement is also incorrect. It is a fact that the conditions of the working faces in mines often change, and it also increases the difficulty of promoting planned management, but this difficulty can be completely overcome. The Xikuangshan Mining Bureau has good examples. Before formulating the operation plan, the bureau made precise and detailed appraisals of the working faces, and conducted appraisals of the rock hardness, direction, slope, specification, operation method, arrangement, number, and depth of the blast holes for each working face. Then, the operation plan was formulated based on the appraisal results, which made the operation plan more practical. Therefore, it is not that mines cannot promote operation plans and implement planned management, but whether we pay attention to it or not.

    Some factory and mine leaders believe that we completed production tasks in the past without planned management, so why do we need planned management now? These comrades do not understand that although production tasks were completed in the past, they were not completed well or very well. For example, some factories and mines completed them by rushing overtime and increasing the labor intensity of workers; some completed the output but failed to complete the quality; or the material consumption was high and the cost was too high. These are not in line with the requirements of our production technology and financial plan. Under such circumstances, of course, it is necessary to carry out planned management, because with good planned management, there are complete operation plans and sound scheduling systems. Not only can the production tasks be overfulfilled, but they can also be completed in a balanced manner, which will also help improve product quality and reduce product costs. After the implementation of planned management in Xikuangshan, the main figures in mid-June were very different compared with the month before the implementation of planned management: the efficiency of manual miners increased by 35.5 percent, the mechanical mining capacity increased by 294 percent, the direct cost per ton of ore in mechanical mining decreased by 50.16 percent, and the cost per ton of ore in manual mining decreased by 16.82 percent. Moreover, balanced production was initially achieved. Twenty-three of the twenty-six mining groups in the bureau were able to complete their production tasks on a ten-day and monthly basis in a balanced manner in June. This proves how important planned management is for our factories and mines.

    In addition, some leading comrades think that the realization of planned management is very easy and simple. They say that the operation plan is the main link of planned management, and the operation plan is the small group plan of the past, but the production tasks are arranged on a ten-day and daily basis. Isn't the realization of planned management achieved with such an operation plan? Under this understanding, a very hasty attitude was adopted towards the formulation of the operation plan. The operation plan was not handed over to the masses for good discussion, and the masses were not mobilized to tap potential and find tricks, and there was even less talk about formulating technical and organizational measures plans and promoting advanced experience to ensure the realization of the operation plan. This view and practice is actually to cancel planned management, and its error is very obvious.

    These situations show that our leading organs must also educate the leading cadres of factories and mines to make everyone clearly understand the important significance of planned management. If this work is neglected, it will delay and delay the comprehensive realization of planned management in our factories and mines. At the same time, some leading cadres who still have resistance to strengthening planned management should, from now on, unremittingly study the instructions and documents of the higher authorities, deeply understand the specific conditions of their enterprises, criticize various erroneous ideas that ignore planned management, take active actions, and strive to implement planned management and transform enterprises.

    纠正对计划管理的错误看法
    学会用科学方法管理企业
    有色金属工业管理局中南分局副局长    许兴
    四年来，中南全区各有色金属厂矿已基本上完成了政治改革，在企业管理工作上一般都有了很大的进步；但从国家整个经济建设特别是今年开始的五年经济建设计划的要求来看，我们的工作还远不能适应新形势的要求。目前各厂矿存在的问题很多，很严重。首先是几种主要产品没有完成今年上半年的生产任务。有的厂矿虽然完成了任务，但却是加班突击、增加工人劳动强度的结果。工作效率低、设备利用率低，是各厂矿普遍存在的现象。去年下半年，苏联专家指出水口山矿务局第三厂还有百分之二十四到四十二的潜力未发挥，这个工厂的设备利用率只达到百分之二十八。此外，材料消耗大，供应不及时，成本高等等缺点，都是严重而普遍地存在着。
    为什么生产上存在这么多严重的问题呢？最根本的原因是管理落后于生产。生产规模扩大了，群众的劳动热情提高了；而管理工作却跟不上新形势的需要，计划管理在厂矿中没有很好地建立。我们的厂矿领导干部大多出身于农村，或者是刚从农村调到厂矿来。他们对于运用计划管理这一科学方法来管理现代化企业的知识是生疏的，有些对计划管理甚至有不正确的看法，对接受这一科学管理方法，思想上存在抵触情绪，结果便在各种藉口下，放松了计划管理和作业计划的推行。比如：
    有的厂矿领导干部强调“条件”，认为本企业政治条件差，干部力量弱，工作混乱，不能推行作业计划、贯彻计划管理。这些同志不懂得推行作业计划是能够为企业管理的正常发展创造条件的；也不懂得作业计划是加强计划管理的中心环节，把这一工作搞好，就可以连带地逐步搞好企业中的其他工作。因而，越是厂矿条件差，工作混乱，就越需要抓作业计划。上半年，锡矿山矿务局抽调了百多名技术干部支援国家基本建设，当时该局领导干部认为技术干部力量削弱太多，对工作会有影响。但后来在实施计划管理中，提高了干部的业务水平，把生产纳入了正轨，就感到现有的技术干部已能够把工作做好。同样，水口山矿务局第一厂的材料库，原来工作很乱，并叫嚷着干部太少；但经过实施计划管理、整顿科室工作以后，这一混乱现象也完全被扭转过来。
    有的矿山的领导干部说，工厂里可以搞计划管理，但矿山是靠天吃饭，掌子出砂时好时坏，各个掌子情况也不同，谁也不能控制，怎么能实施计划管理，推行作业计划呢？我认为这种说法也是不对的。矿山中掌子的情况时常变化是事实，也给推行计划管理增加了困难，但这困难是完全可以克服的。锡矿山矿务局已有好的例子。该局在制订作业计划前，精密细致地做了掌子鉴定，对每个掌子的岩石软硬、方向、坡度、规格、作业的方法、炮眼的排列、个数、深度等等，都进行了鉴定。然后，根据鉴定结果制订作业计划，这样就使得作业计划更加切合实际。所以，不是矿山不能推行作业计划和实施计划管理，而是我们重视与否的问题。
    有的厂矿领导干部认为：过去我们没有搞计划管理也完成了生产任务，现在何必要搞什么计划管理呢？这些同志不了解：过去虽然完成了生产任务，但完成得不够好或者很不好。如有些厂矿是加班突击增加工人劳动强度来完成的；有的完成了产量却完不成质量；或者材料消耗大，成本过高。这些都是不适合我们的生产技术财务计划的要求的。在这样情况下，当然需要搞计划管理，因为搞好计划管理，有完善的作业计划，有健全的调度制度，生产任务不但能超额完成，而且能均衡完成，同时有助于提高产品的质量和降低产品的成本。锡矿山实施计划管理后，六月中旬的几项主要数字和未实施计划管理前一月比较起来，就有了很大的差别：手采工效率提高了百分之三十五点五，机采能力提高了百分之二百九十四，机采每吨矿石直接成本降低了百分之五十点一六，手采每吨矿石成本降低了百分之一十六点八二。而且初步达到了均衡生产，该局六月份二十六个采矿小组，已有二十三个能按旬按月均衡完成生产任务。从这里证明，搞计划管理对于我们厂矿是如何重要。
    另外有些领导同志则把实现计划管理看得很容易、很简单。他们说：作业计划是计划管理的主要环节，而作业计划就是过去的小组计划，不过把生产任务按旬按日排定一下。有了这样的作业计划不就是实现了计划管理吗？在这样认识下，对制订作业计划采取了极草率的态度，不把作业计划交给群众好好讨论，也不去发动群众挖潜力、找窍门，更谈不到制订技术组织措施计划和推广先进经验来保证作业计划的实现。这种看法和做法，实际上是取消计划管理，其错误是很明显的。
    这些情况，说明我们领导机关还必须对厂矿的领导干部进行教育，使大家明确认识计划管理的重要意义。如果疏忽了这一工作，就会延缓和迟误计划管理在我们厂矿的全面实现。同时，对加强计划管理还存在抵触情绪的某些领导干部，应从现在起，不懈地钻研上级的指示及文件，深入地了解本企业的具体情况，批判各种忽视计划管理的错误思想，采取积极行动，为贯彻计划管理而努力，为实现企业的改造而努力。
