    Former British Labour Government Trade Minister Dissatisfied with US Policy of Restricting East-West Trade
    Advocates Breaking Free from US Interference and Expanding Trade with Democratic Countries
    [Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th] According to a TASS report from London: The British International Trade Promotion Committee reported that British manufacturers have lost at least £40 million worth of orders in the past year or so as a result of the ban on East-West trade. The committee has listed the lost orders from the Soviet Union, China, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary in a table, but the committee's report says that this table is neither complete nor representative.
    The committee's report pointed out: "Due to the development of the international situation in recent months, people are increasingly interested in the possibility of trading with China, the Soviet Union, and Eastern European countries."
    [Xinhua News Agency, London, 4th] According to a TASS report from London: Former Labour government Trade Minister Harold Wilson published an article in the "Tribune" weekly, advocating that Britain break free from US interference and independently formulate its own trade policy.
    Wilson pointed out that Britain's military spending abroad is much greater than the "aid" it receives from the United States. He said that Britain would be much better off without American "aid," both economically and politically.
    Wilson wrote that the Republican Congress had made people abandon the last bit of hope that the United States would adopt a more liberal policy.
    Wilson emphasized that Britain must not only expand its trade within the Commonwealth, but also expand its trade with the Soviet Union and other democratic countries. Wilson said: "East-West trade is valuable for our self-reliance plan, and important for our hope of full employment. This trade must not be discriminated against for the sake of political hysteria. Many restrictions on East-West trade were unreasonable even under the circumstances of the Korean War. Now, these restrictions are meaningless and should be eliminated."

    英前工党政府贸易大臣不满美国限制东西方贸易的政策
    主张摆脱美国干涉扩大和民主国家的贸易
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国国际贸易促进委员会报告说，过去一年左右，由于禁止东西方贸易的结果，英国厂商至少损失了价值四千万英镑的订货。委员会把所损失的苏联、中国、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利的订货列成了表格，但是委员会的报告说，这个表格是既不完全又没有代表性的。
    委员会的报告指出：“由于近几月来国际形势的发展，人们对于与中国、苏联以及东欧国家进行贸易的可能性已越来越感到兴趣。”
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦四日讯：前工党政府贸易大臣哈罗德·威尔逊在“论坛”周刊上发表文章，主张英国摆脱美国的干涉，独立制订自己的贸易政策。
    威尔逊指出，英国在国外的军事开支比从美国得到的“援助”多得多。他说，不论在经济上也好，在政治上也好，英国不要美国的“援助”，就会好得多。
    威尔逊写道，共和党的国会使人们放弃了以为美国会采取一种比较自由的政策的最后一点希望。
    威尔逊强调指出，英国不但必须扩大它在英联邦以内的贸易，同时还必须扩大与苏联和其他民主国家的贸易。威尔逊说：“东西方贸易对于我们的自立计划是有价值的，对于我们充分就业的希望是重要的。决不能为了政治歇斯底里而歧视这种贸易。对东西方贸易的许多限制即使是在朝鲜战争的情况下也是不合理的。现在，这种限制已经没有意义，而应该加以消除了。”
