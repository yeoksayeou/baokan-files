The CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau issued instructions to Party committees in North China on September 10 regarding strengthening leadership in the autumn harvest distribution work of agricultural producers' cooperatives. The instructions stated: The autumn harvest season has arrived, and whether the land of agricultural producers' cooperatives can increase production and whether the distribution after the increase is reasonable are issues of utmost concern to the broad masses of cooperative members. Currently, there is a saying circulating among cooperative members: "Whether to dissolve or not depends on the autumn; we'll continue if we get more grain, we'll dissolve if we get less." The masses outside the cooperatives are also closely watching the income situation of the cooperative members to decide whether to join next year. Therefore, the autumn harvest distribution work of agricultural producers' cooperatives is one of the key issues for the consolidation and development of agricultural producers' cooperatives after the autumn. The instructions mentioned the lessons learned from the autumn of last year when some local Party organizations underestimated the importance of this work, resulting in only paying attention to production and neglecting distribution, or only emphasizing increasing public property and neglecting increasing the actual income of individual cooperative members. Some agricultural producers' cooperatives had large increases in production, but the actual income of cooperative members decreased instead. In addition, some cooperatives did not follow the mass line in distribution, leading to many disputes, or there was no distribution for a long time, resulting in significant losses, which not only directly harmed the actual interests of cooperative members and affected the consolidation of the cooperatives, but also created a bad influence among the masses. The instructions call on the relevant county Party committees to pay attention, to start early this year, and after necessary meetings or short-term training for a certain number of cadres, clearly explain the policies and practices to them, and then let them go deep into key agricultural producers' cooperatives to make a model of this work and promote the overall situation. It is imperative that the autumn harvest distribution work of agricultural producers' cooperatives can be carried out with leadership, preparation, and order.

Regarding the matters that should be paid attention to in the distribution work, the instructions pointed out the following points: (1) The members should democratically agree on a simple and easy-to-implement distribution method, and do their best to distribute as they harvest to prevent a large amount of grain from being centralized, accumulated, transferred, borrowed, or misappropriated, so as to avoid chaos and losses. (2) The interests of land, labor, agriculture, and sideline industries must be taken into account; for harvests of different prices and different qualities, the actual needs of the members should be taken into account to adjust the distribution to ensure everyone is satisfied. (3) First, the personal interests of the members should be taken care of, ensuring that the actual income of the members is not lower than the level before joining the cooperative and is increased. Only on this principle can the necessary public accumulation be made and the necessary production expenses for next year be deducted, so that there is the possibility of expanding reproduction next year. However, if this year's total income is not high and the actual income of the members has not increased, then the public accumulation that is not urgently needed at present should be resolutely reduced, and unnecessary expenses should be reduced to ensure the income of the members. (4) Some cooperatives in the past had too much debt and too much investment. If repaying the loan would cause the income of the members to drop significantly compared to before joining the cooperative, the methods of repaying in installments or paying only interest or suspending both principal and interest should be resolutely implemented to maintain the income of the members at a level no lower than the actual level before joining the cooperative and consolidate the production enthusiasm of the members. (5) Through the distribution work, the operation and management of the cooperative should be effectively rectified and improved to achieve democratic unity within the agricultural producers' cooperative and further consolidate the cooperative.

The instructions finally required local cadres to actively focus on improving the overall work of the cooperative when leading the distribution work, closely integrate it with the production work after the autumn harvest, and regard distribution as an important step in rectifying and consolidating the cooperative and educating the members and the masses. It called on the Communist Party members in the cooperative to treat the distribution work with their own exemplary actions and selfless spirit, and not to hinder the correct progress of the distribution work and the consolidation of the cooperative for the sake of personal gain. In the distribution process, it is also necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of the members, commend and reward good people and good deeds, and publicize good experiences. After the autumn harvest, a plan should be made immediately to shift to autumn and winter production and plan for next year's production so that production will not be interrupted.

    中共中央华北局指示各地党委
    加强领导农业生产合作社的秋收分配工作
    中共中央华北局九月十日向华北各地党委发出关于加强领导农业生产合作社的秋收分配工作的指示。指示说：秋收时期已到，农业生产合作社的土地能否增产和增产后分配是否合理，是广大社员最关心的问题。现在社员中流传着“散不散，秋后看；多分粮就办，少分粮就散”的说法。社外群众也密切注视着社员收入的情形，以决定他们明年是否入社。所以农业生产合作社的秋收分配工作，是秋后农业生产合作社能否巩固和发展的关键问题之一。指示提到去年秋季一些地区党的组织对此项工作重要性估计不足的教训，结果只注意生产忽略分配，或只强调增加公共财产忽视增加社员个人的实际收入。一些农业生产合作社增产虽多，但社员的实际收入反而减少，以及有的社在分配时不走群众路线，形成很多纠纷，或长期没有分配，损耗很大，不但直接损害了社员的实际利益，影响到社的巩固，并在群众中造成不好的影响。指示唤起各有关县委注意，叫他们今年及早下手，对一定数量的干部经过必要的会议或短期训练，交代清楚政策和作法，然后让他们深入到重点农业生产合作社去，把这项工作做出样子，推动全盘。务使农业生产合作社的秋收分配工作，能够有领导、有准备、有秩序地进行。
    关于分配工作中应注意的事项，指示指出以下各点：（一）由社员民主议定简单易行的分配办法，并尽可能做到随收随分，防止粮食大量集中、积存，层层转手、借用、挪用，以免造成混乱和损耗。（二）对土地、劳力，农业、副业等方面的利益必须兼顾；对不同价格、不同质量的收获物，要照顾社员的实际需要调剂分配，做到人人满意。（三）首先照顾社员个人的利益，保证社员的实际收入不低于入社前的水平并有所增加，在此原则下方可积累必要的公积金和扣除明年必要的生产开支，使明年有扩大再生产的可能，但如今年总收入不多，社员的实际收入没有增加，则应暂时坚决减削目前不急需的公共积累，并紧缩不必要的开支，以保证社员的收入。（四）有些合作社过去贷款过多，投资过大，归还贷款若使社员收入较入社前显著下降时，应坚决执行分期分批交还或只付利息或本息均暂停付等办法予以解决，保持社员收入不低于未入社前的实际水平，巩固社员的生产情绪。（五）经过分配工作，切实整顿与改善合作社的经营管理，达到农业生产合作社内民主团结，并使社进一步巩固。
    指示最后要求各地干部在领导分配工作中，积极从改善合作社的全面工作着眼，密切结合秋后的生产工作，把分配当作整顿与巩固合作社，教育社员和群众的重要步骤。号召社员中的共产党员以自己的模范行动和大公无私精神对待分配工作，不得为图私利而妨碍分配工作的正确进行和合作社的巩固，在分配过程中，还需加强对社员的政治思想教育，表扬和奖励好人好事，宣传好的经验。秋收结束后，应即作出计划转入秋冬生产，并筹划明年生产，使生产不致中断。（新华社）
