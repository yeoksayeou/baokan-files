	First Session of Zhejiang Mass Art School Opens
	The first session of the Zhejiang Mass Art School, sponsored by the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government's Cultural Affairs Bureau, opened on September 11th. This is a school for training core members of amateur arts activities in factories and rural areas, as well as folk artists. Through learning, students will clarify the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, master necessary professional knowledge and skills, and learn some excellent small local operas, music, dance and other programs, and then return to various places to promote them after graduation, in order to meet the growing cultural and entertainment needs of the working people.
	The students in this session were selected from farmers in six counties of the Ningbo Special Zone by the school, a total of sixty people. Many of the students are good at excellent folk music and dance programs such as "Lotus Seed Row," "Lion Dance," and "Ancient Vase," and some are the main actors and directors of rural Yue Opera troupes.
	During the study period, the school will organize students to perform their own familiar quyi, folk songs, dances, etc., and then jointly study, sort out, process and improve them, and select excellent programs for performance and promotion. At the same time, the school is also preparing to teach students some ready-made excellent local opera programs, as well as group dances, folk dances, etc., and will systematically hold some relatively popular lectures on professional knowledge such as performance, directing, sight-reading, teaching singing, and makeup. The school will also summarize the experience of carrying out mass art activities and study how rural theater troupes can combine activities with production through seminars, group discussions, and other methods.

	Nanjing Film Machinery Factory Successfully Trial-Produces Picture Lens
	The Nanjing Film Machinery Factory has successfully trial-produced picture lenses and started mass production from September. This kind of picture lens is installed on film projectors and used to display movie pictures on the screen. In the past, our country could not manufacture them. In March of this year, Cao Fengsheng, a technician at the Nanjing Film Machinery Factory, began research and design of the picture lens, and cooperated with optical workshop technicians Wang Dejun and Jiao Qisheng to finally successfully trial-produce it. The brightness of this picture lens reaches 98% of the brightness of lenses manufactured in the Soviet Union, and other performances are also very good.

	Datong Coal Mine Construction Site Cultural Service Team Performs for Workers at the Construction Site
	The Propaganda Department of the Datong Coal Mine Party Committee and the Cultural and Educational Department of the Mine Trade Union, etc., transferred a group of cadres in early May. After short-term training and preparation, they formed a cultural service team at the construction site to carry out recreational and publicity activities in various basic construction sites.
	The cultural service team at the construction site often goes deep into the construction site and workers' dormitories for propaganda and visits, and organizes seminars; they often "take materials on the spot" to educate the masses with vivid facts. The cultural service team at the construction site also uses various forms of publicity to meet the cultural requirements of employees, such as showing movies and slides, holding picture exhibitions, setting up mobile libraries, and organizing good news teams and quyi groups. Wherever the quyi group goes, the workers surround them and express their welcome. In addition, the cultural service team at the construction site helps the grassroots trade unions at the construction site to establish and improve propaganda organizations and cultivate propaganda forces in each unit they go to.

    浙江群众艺术学校第一期开学
    浙江省人民政府文化事业管理局主办的浙江群众艺术学校第一期在九月十一日开学。这是一所训练工农业余文艺活动骨干分子及民间艺人的学校。通过学习将使学员们明确工农兵的文艺方向，掌握必要的业务知识和技术，学会一些优秀的小型地方戏曲、音乐、舞蹈等节目，毕业后带回各地推广，以满足工农群众日益增长的文化娱乐要求。
    这一期学员是由学校派人到宁波专区六个县从农民中挑选而来的，共计六十名。学员中很多人擅长“莲子行”、“狮舞”、“古瓶”等优秀民间音乐舞蹈节目，有的是农村越剧团的主要演员和编导。
    在学习期间，学校将组织学员表演他们自己熟悉的曲艺、民歌、舞蹈等，然后共同研究、整理、加工提高，选择其中优秀的节目加以演出推广。同时学校还准备对学员教授一些现成的优秀地方戏曲节目及集体舞、民间舞等，并将有系统地配合举行一些表演、导演、识谱、教唱、化妆等业务知识的比较通俗化的讲座。学校中还要通过座谈、小组讨论等方式，总结开展群众文艺活动的经验，研究农村剧团如何结合生产进行活动。
    南京电影机械厂试制画面镜头成功

    大同煤矿工地文化服务队到工地为工人演出
    中共大同煤矿党委宣传部和矿区工会文教部等单位，于五月初抽调一批干部，经过短期训练和准备，组成了工地文化服务队，深入到各基本建设工地进行文娱宣传活动。
    工地文化服务队常常深入工地和工人宿舍进行宣传和访问，组织座谈；他们往往“就地取材”，用生动的事实来教育群众。工地文化服务队还运用各种宣传形式，来满足职工群众的文化要求，如放映电影、幻灯片，举办图片展览，设立流动图书馆，组织报喜队和曲艺组等。曲艺组到那里，工友们就把他们围起来，表示欢迎。此外，工地文化服务队每到一个单位，就帮助工地基层工会建立和健全宣传组织，培养宣传力量。
