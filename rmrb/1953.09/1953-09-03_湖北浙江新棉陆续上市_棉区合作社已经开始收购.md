    New Cotton from Hubei and Zhejiang Enters the Market Successively;
    Cotton Area Cooperatives Begin Purchasing
    New cotton in Hubei and Zhejiang provinces has entered the market successively, and cooperatives in cotton-producing areas have started their purchasing work.
    Learning from the experience of purchasing cotton last year and wheat this year, the cooperatives have made full preparations for the cotton purchasing work this year. Before the new cotton entered the market, Huanggang Special District in Hubei Province formulated purchasing plans from September to December based on cotton production, and developed monthly plans according to the new cotton market situation. This ensures that they have a clear understanding of fund allocation, organizational structure, and staffing, preventing the purchasing process from being affected by plans that are divorced from reality as happened in the past. As early as late July, the Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative issued a "Notice on Preparing for Cotton and Hemp Purchasing," and cooperatives in cotton-producing areas have been working intensely on various preparations. Yuyao County, which produces the largest amount of cotton, held a meeting on August 2nd for directors, business cadres, and inspectors of grassroots cooperatives in cotton areas. The meeting conveyed the policies and guidelines for new cotton purchasing, formulated purchasing plans, and discussed solutions to issues such as publicity, education, organizational leadership, and specific work steps. In terms of organizational structure, Huanggang Special District in Hubei Province plans to set up 254 purchasing stations in accordance with the principles of economic accounting and convenience for farmers to sell their cotton. In order to implement the "better quality, better price" policy and overcome the phenomenon of downgrading and price suppression that occurred in some areas last year, the Central South Cooperative Affairs Administration, the Hubei Provincial Cooperative, and the Special District Cooperative Section have trained 208 cotton inspectors, respectively, and each cotton-producing area has also trained a batch of its own. The Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative held a cotton inspector training class as early as early May, training inspection personnel. These inspectors have improved their political and professional skills during the training, ensuring that they can correctly implement the state price policy during purchasing.
    This year's purchasing task is very large. The planned figures for Huanggang Special District in Hubei Province from September to December alone are 50% higher than the planned figures for the entire last year. Limited by their own capabilities, the cooperatives will increase the proportion of ginned cotton purchased according to the specific circumstances; however, they will still try their best to purchase seed cotton for processing in order to meet the needs of the textile industry. To this end, all counties are actively organizing processing forces to ensure timely processing.
    In order to achieve "fast transportation," the cooperatives have negotiated and signed transportation contracts with transportation departments to ensure fast collection and transportation as much as possible. In areas relying on manual transportation, organized farmers such as mutual aid groups or members' groups are relied upon to implement "contracted transportation."
    While preparing for purchasing, the cooperative departments are actively organizing sources of goods to prepare for peak season supply after autumn. Huanggang Special District in Hubei Province has comprehensively formulated a supply plan for the entire district based on actual investigation materials. The total supply amount in the third quarter of this year is 17% higher than that in the first quarter, and the fourth quarter is 50% higher than that in the first quarter. Each county in the district is actively improving the work of opening up sources of goods. The first step is to improve the business of wholesale stations, reduce circulation links, and sign supply contracts with state-owned trading companies and production and sales contracts with local handicrafts to organize local sources of goods.
    In addition, regarding the adjustment of cotton purchasing prices this year, Zhejiang Province has conducted publicity and education work for cotton farmers. However, some cooperative cadres in cotton areas do not fully understand the significance of this year's adjustment of the cotton-grain price ratio and seasonal price differences and dare not openly explain it to the masses. The Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative has issued instructions to correct this.

### 湖北浙江新棉陆续上市  棉区合作社已经开始收购

    湖北浙江新棉陆续上市
    棉区合作社已经开始收购
    湖北、浙江两省的新棉已陆续上市，棉区各合作社已展开收购工作。
    今年合作社接受去年购棉及今年收麦的教训，对收购棉花工作作了充分准备。湖北省黄冈专区各县在新棉上市前就根据棉花产量制定了从九月份到十二月份的收购计划，并根据新棉上市情况，制定出月度计划。这样在资金调拨上、组织机构上和人员配备上都能做到“心中有数”，使今后不再因计划脱离实际而影响收购。浙江省合作社早在七月下旬就发出“关于做好棉麻收购准备工作”的通知，棉区合作社紧张地进行了各项准备。产棉数量最多的馀姚县，合作社在八月二日召开了棉区基层合作社主任、业务干部、验货人员会议，传达新棉收购方针、政策，制订了收购计划；讨论解决了有关宣传教育、组织领导、具体工作步骤等问题。在组织机构上，在符合经济核算和便利农民出售的原则下湖北黄冈专区计划设置二百五十四个收购站。为了贯彻“优级优价”政策，克服去年部分地区压级、压价的现象，已分别由中南合作事业管理局、湖北省合作社、专区合作科训练了棉花检验人员二百零八人，各产棉区自己还训练了一批。浙江省合作社早在五月上旬就举办了棉花检验人员训练班，训练检验人员。这些验货人员在训练中都提高了政治、业务水平，保证了在收购中能正确贯彻国家价格政策。
    今年收购任务很大，湖北黄冈专区仅九月至十二月的计划数字就比去年全年计划多百分之五十。合作社限于本身力量，将根据具体情况，增加皮棉收购比例；但仍将尽力收购籽棉加工，以适合纺织需要。为此，各县正积极组织加工力量，做到及时加工。
    为了做到“快运”，合作社已与运输部门协商签订运输合同，尽量做到快收快运。靠人力运输的地方，依靠互助组或社员小组等有组织的农民实行
    “包运”。
    与收购准备工作同时，合作部门正积极组织货源，准备秋后旺季供应。湖北黄冈专区根据实际调查材料，综合制定全区供应计划。今年第三季度的供应总额较第一季度增加百分之十七，第四季度较第一季度增加百分之五十。该区各县正积极改进开辟货源工作。首先是改进批发站业务，减少流转环节，并与国营贸易公司签订了供应合同，与当地手工业签订产销合同，组织地方货源。
    此外，关于今年棉花的收购价格的调整，浙江省对棉农进行了宣传教育工作，但部分棉区合作社的干部，对今年调整棉粮比价及季节差价的意义领会不足，不敢正面向群众宣传解释。浙江省合作社特发出指示，予以纠正。
