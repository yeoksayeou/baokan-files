    The "Five Excesses" Phenomenon Still Exists in Tuqiao Township, Base Point of the Tong County Party Committee; Frequent Visits by Work Teams Hinder Agricultural Production
    Tuqiao Township, a base point of the Tong County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, still suffers from the serious "five excesses" and chaotic work practices, hindering autumn production efforts.
    From June 26th to August 16th, a period of over fifty days, fifty-one cadres from seventeen units at higher levels came to work in Tuqiao Township. People came from central-level organs down to the county and district levels, including personnel from party and government systems, mass organizations, and economic enterprises. Some came to understand the situation, some to rectify organizations, and others to inspect work, conduct typical investigations, or experience life, averaging fourteen cadres working in the township every day. They convened their own meetings with local cadres and the masses. In fifty days, they held seven meetings of the township government committee, eight meetings of the Party branch committee, four meetings of Party member congresses, sixteen meetings of the Communist Youth League, and five meetings of the armed forces committee. Some township cadres repeatedly attended meetings. The township held so many meetings that a series of meetings had to be held in the villages as well. There were already too many meetings for general cadres, and even more for Party members, League members, and mutual aid team leaders. This situation seriously hindered production and aroused dissatisfaction among local cadres and the masses. The leader of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League's work team lived in the township, yet the weeds in the two mu of cornfield belonging to Weng Shilan, the deputy secretary of the township's Communist Youth League branch, were two and a half feet high. Township cadres were overwhelmed and unable to cope. Some refused to meet with members of the work teams. The Wu Yuqin mutual aid team, because of the frequent visits from work teams which affected production, refused further visits.
    This area had just been divided into townships, and concrete help for township cadres was very important. Although there were many work teams from higher levels, few people specifically helped the township cadres or taught them working methods. For example, the county and district only made arrangements for autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, but few people concerned themselves with how to help the township cadres implement these arrangements concretely. Township cadres were simply busy and unable to delve deeply. Cadres receiving subsidies in the township did not know how to work, only helping village cadres hold meetings. Many concrete problems in the work were not solved, and experiences could not be summarized. The county, district, and township's generalized leadership methods had not changed. The relationship between the township and the village was unclear, and work was duplicated. Since the division of townships, the five kinds of committees in the township and villages had never studied their work. Either the township cadres monopolized everything or they relied on the village director for everything. Some village directors said, "Being a village director is more troublesome than being a village head." Therefore, the work still remained on the shoulders of the village cadres.
    The Tong County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has sent a work team to inspect the work of the township and, in response to the above situation, has put forward suggestions for improving the work of cadres in the base point township. It has also stipulated that the entry of work teams into the base point township must be strictly controlled to correct the practice of various agencies and units going to the base point township to investigate everything. In order to prevent the phenomenon of decentralism, the work of the base point township must be carried out under the unified leadership of the county party committee, the district party committee, and the township branch committee. Cadres going to the countryside must complete their own work on the premise of doing a good job in the central work and must not disrupt the township's work plan. The Tong County Party Committee believes that the key to doing a good job in the base point township lies mainly in the leadership of the county and district. At present, all work in the base point township is in its initial stage, and the county and district leadership must specifically help the township to do a good job. It is wrong to only designate a base point without giving cadres methods.

    中共通县地委基点乡土桥乡还存在“五多”现象
    工作组来往频繁妨碍农业生产
    中共通县地委基点乡——土桥乡仍存在严重的“五多”及工作上的忙乱现象，妨碍秋季生产工作。
    自六月二十六日到八月十六日五十多天内，就有上级十七个单位共五十一个干部到土桥乡工作。上自中央一级机关，下至县区，都有人来这里，其中包括党政系统、群众团体、经济企业单位等的人员。这些人有的是来了解情况的，有的是来整顿组织的，有的则是来检查工作、作典型调查，或体验生活的，平均每天有十四个干部在乡里工作。他们召集当地干部和群众各开各的会，五十天共召开乡政府委员会七次，党支部委员会八次，党员大会四次，青年团会十六次，武装委员会五次，有的乡干部重复参加会议；乡里开了这样多的会，到了村里还得照样开一连串的会。一般干部的会已经够多，党员、团员、互助组长的会议更多。这种情况，严重地妨碍了生产，引起了当地干部和群众的不满。团中央工作组的组长就住在该乡，而该乡团支部副书记翁士蓝的二亩玉米地里长的草却有二尺半高。乡干部忙乱不堪，难以应付，有的就拒绝和工作组的人员见面，吴玉琴互助组因为工作组访问过勤，影响生产，就表示拒绝访问。
    该地本来刚划过乡，具体帮助乡干部的工作是很重要的。上级工作组虽然多，却很少有人具体帮助乡干部，教给他们工作方法。如对秋收、秋种、秋耕工作，县、区只作了布置，但对如何帮助乡干部具体实现，就很少有人过问。乡干部只是忙乱，不能深入，乡里受补助的干部不知道怎样作工作，只是帮助村干部开开会，许多具体工作中的问题没有解决，经验总结不出来，县、区、乡一般化的领导方法还没有改变。乡和村的关系不明确，工作重复。自划乡以来，乡和村里的五种委员会从来没有研究过工作，不是乡干部包办，就是事事依靠村主任，有的村主任说：“当村主任比当村长时还事多。”因此，工作还是停留在村干部身上。
    中共通县地委已派工作组检查了该乡的工作，针对以上情况，对基点乡干部的工作提出了改进意见。并规定要严格控制进入基点乡的工作组，纠正各机关单位事事都到基点乡调查的作法。为防止分散主义的现象，基点乡的工作要在县委、区委、乡支委统一领导下进行工作。下乡干部要在作好中心工作的前提下，完成自己要完成的工作，不得打乱乡的工作计划。通县地委认为：基点乡工作搞好的关键，主要在于县、区领导，目前基点乡的一切工作都在初创，县、区领导须具体帮助乡搞好工作，只确定基点而不给干部办法是不对的。
