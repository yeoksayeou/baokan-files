The Soviet Ministry of Trade has established nearly five hundred department stores and branches in one hundred and forty cities across the country. The network of department stores and shops is expanding every year. Recently, dozens of new stores have opened in Moscow. The largest store in the Soviet Union, the Moscow State Department Store, is being renovated. It has a total area of ​​47,000 square meters, and the counters in each shopping area are two and a half kilometers long. Seventy-two new stores have also opened in various districts of Leningrad this year, many of which are located on the bottom floor of apartment buildings.

With the expansion of the trade network and the increase in people's demand for daily necessities, the turnover of department stores and shops has also greatly increased.
