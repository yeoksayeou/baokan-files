Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The Standing Council of the Japan-China Friendship Association and Hiratsuka Tsunejiro, Chairman of the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade, sent letters to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade in July and August this year, respectively, requesting to send delegations to China to participate in the 1953 National Day celebrations and visit.

After receiving the letter, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace telegraphed the Japan-China Friendship Association on September 8, agreeing to their dispatching a delegation of 15 representatives from all sectors of Japan to China in late September to participate in the National Day celebrations and visit. On the 7th, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade also telegraphed Hiratsuka Tsunejiro, Chairman of the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade, proposing that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also intends to send a delegation to visit Japan. If this proposal can be agreed upon by the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade and efforts are made to realize it, then the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade agrees to the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade sending a delegation including representatives of various parties within the League, together with industrial trade experts, not exceeding 25 people, to visit China in late September.

On September 15th and 17th, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade successively received telegrams from the Japan-China Friendship Association and the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade regarding the list of delegations to China and related issues. After receiving the telegrams, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade jointly replied to the above-mentioned two groups in Japan on September 19. The telegram reads as follows: To the Standing Council of the Japan-China Friendship Association: To Mr. Hiratsuka Tsunejiro, Chairman of the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade:

    1. Your association's telegram of September 17 and the list of 15 delegation members have been received. The number of your representatives and the breadth of representation listed in the telegram fully meet our original intention and hope for the invitation, and we express our sincere welcome. Our association has now applied to our government for entry visas for the 15-member delegation of your association. We hope that you will telegraph us the exact date of arrival of your delegation in Hong Kong to assist.

    2. Your League has not replied in your two telegrams to our inquiry in our telegram of September 7 as to whether you agree to our proposal for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to send a delegation to visit Japan, and whether you are willing to work hard to promote its realization, which has added serious difficulties for us in considering the procedures for your League's delegation to enter the country. We hope that you will give us a clear answer immediately so that we can formally apply to our government for your League's delegation to enter the country.

    In addition, the list of names listed in the two telegrams from your League only includes a part of the various parties within your League, but does not yet include representatives of other parties within your League. We hope that after receiving the telegram, you will supplement the list of representatives of other parties within your League as soon as possible for unified consideration. As for your League's request to increase the total number of visiting delegations to 31, due to the limited quota for receiving foreign guests during our National Day, it is difficult to increase the number. Please limit the number to 25.

    3. Once the entry visas are approved by our government, the travel expenses of your association's delegation to our country and the travel and accommodation expenses within our country will be our full responsibility. If your League needs any travel and accommodation expenses, our association is also willing to bear the same responsibility.

    We hereby send this telegram and look forward to your prompt reply.
                Chinese People's Committee for World Peace
                China Council for the Promotion of International Trade
                 September 19, 1953

    关于日本各界代表来我国参加国庆观礼问题
    我和大与国际贸易促进会电复日本两团体
    【新华社二十日讯】日本日中友好协会常任理事会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟理事长平冢常次郎，在今年七、八月间分别致函中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国国际贸易促进委员会，要求派遣代表团来中国参加一九五三年国庆典礼并访问。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会接信后，在九月八日电复日本日中友好协会，同意他们派遣一个由日本各界代表十五人组成的代表团于九月下旬前来中国参加国庆观礼并访问。七日，中国国际贸易促进委员会亦电复日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟理事长平冢常次郎，提出中国人民政治协商会议亦拟派代表团访问日本，如此项建议能获日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟同意并努力促其实现，则中国国际贸易促进委员会同意日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟派遣一个包括该联盟内各党派代表连同产业贸易专家共不超过二十五人的代表团，于九月下旬来中国访问。
    九月十五日和十七日，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国国际贸易促进委员会又先后接获日本日中友好协会和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟关于来华代表团名单及有关代表团来华问题的来电。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国国际贸易促进委员会接到来电后，于九月十九日联名复电日本上述二团体。电文如下：日本日中友好协会常任理事会：日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟理事长平冢常次郎先生：
    一、贵协会九月十七日来电及十五名代表团名单已悉。来电中表列之贵代表人数及代表方面之广泛性，完全符合敝会邀请之原意与希望，谨表热诚之欢迎。现敝会已向我国政府申请贵协会十五名代表团之入境签证，盼即电告贵代表团到达香港之确实日期，以便协助。
    二、贵联盟对敝会九月七日去电所询之我国人民政治协商会议派代表团访问日本之建议是否同意，并是否愿努力促其实现，在贵联盟两次来电中均未见复，使敝会在考虑办理贵联盟代表团入境手续上增加严重困难。盼即给予明确答复，以便对贵联盟代表团入境事好向我国政府提出正式申请。
    此外，贵联盟两次来电所列名单，仅包括贵联盟内各党派之一部分，但尚未见包括贵联盟内其他党派之代表，望接电后尽速将贵联盟内其他党派代表之名单补齐，以便统一考虑。至贵联盟所要求拟将访问代表团全体人数增至三十一人事，由于我国国庆节招待外宾有一定限额，碍难增加，仍请限于二十五人以内。
    三、一俟入境签证获得我国政府批准后，贵协会代表团来我国之旅费和在我国境内之旅居费，均将由我们负完全责任。如贵联盟对旅费及旅居费有所需要时，敝会亦愿负同样之责任。
    谨此电达，并盼速复。
                中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
                中国国际贸易促进委员会
                 一九五三年九月十九日
