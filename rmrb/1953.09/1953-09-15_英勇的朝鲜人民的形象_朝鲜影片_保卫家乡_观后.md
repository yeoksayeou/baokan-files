The Korean film "Defend the Homeland," showcasing the revolutionary heroism and patriotism of the Korean people, has been released to Chinese audiences, following the Korean films "My Hometown," "Young Guerrilla," and "Return to the Frontline." The Korean film artists are working under extremely difficult wartime conditions, reproducing the heroic and moving deeds of the Korean people in their struggle against American imperialist aggression on the screen, which is in itself a moving thing. From the several Korean films shown in China, we have seen that the young Korean people's film industry is advancing along the correct path of realism. These films prove that Korean film artists have a deep understanding of the people of their country who are fighting.

"Defend the Homeland" depicts a small village in North Korea, with characters who are ordinary Korean farmers. Many vivid scenes show us the magnificent land of Korea and the heroic spirit of the Korean nation. The film succinctly depicts the free and happy life of Korean farmers before and after liberation, demonstrating the boundless strength of people who have gained a happy life to resist the enemy. Whether it is the protagonist Li Yunyi (Labor Party cell secretary) and his wife Jin Shunde (League of Women committee chairman), or the old farmer Cui Daju, and all the Korean farmers, they have all suffered from the oppression and exploitation of Japanese imperialism and landlords. Li Yunyi and Jin Shunde were once forced to live as hunters in the remote mountains and wilderness. After the liberation of North Korea, they were reborn, reclaiming wasteland and building a happy life with their own hands. Farmers sang and danced, celebrating the harvest. Under the leadership of Li Yunyi, they studied politics and culture. Children began to attend school happily, and young people had great ideals for the future. The young girl, Piao Yingchun, wanted to study animal husbandry, to turn the Korean grasslands into pastures and let everyone wear woolen clothes; Piao Yingchun’s lover, Jin Dahao, wanted to build his country as rich and strong as the Soviet Union, building huge factories and mechanizing agriculture. Just as the Korean people saw their lives improving day by day and were full of bright ideals for the future, American imperialism and its lackey Li Seung-man launched an armed invasion of North Korea. The Korean people fought heroically against the enemy to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland. We see in the film the heroic posture of the Korean People's Army, which in a very short period of time, with an overwhelming force, pushed the American and Li gangs, who dared to provoke the war, to a small corner in the southern part of Korea. At this time, the American imperialists gathered a large number of troops and invaded North Korea again. For strategic reasons, the Korean People's Army temporarily retreated. Li Yunyi's village was temporarily occupied by the enemy. The Korean Labor Party organized guerrillas behind enemy lines. A guerrilla team composed of Li Yunyi and Jin Shunde destroyed the enemy's transportation, burned the enemy's warehouses, attacked the enemy's headquarters, rescued arrested patriotic compatriots, and finally destroyed the enemy's communication lines, annihilating all the enemies who were preparing to escape. The guerrillas powerfully coordinated the military operations of the Korean People's Army.

When describing the activities of this guerrilla team, the film focuses on portraying the guerrillas' resourcefulness and bravery. They initially had no guns or weapons, and later they seized them from the enemy. When the enemy robbed the farmers of their grain, preparing to transport it away, the guerrillas cleverly eliminated the enemy. They posted leaflets around the enemy's headquarters, summoning the compatriots who were temporarily under the enemy's rule to organize and resist the enemy. The descriptions of these plots are compact and vivid. From here, we see the lofty patriotism and revolutionary heroism of the Korean people. In particular, the scene where Li Yunyi valiantly and tenaciously resisted the enemy, covered the guerrillas' transfer, and finally heroically sacrificed himself in a battle, left us with a deep impression. His wife, Jin Shunde, inherited his leadership work, and with the same strong fighting spirit, annihilated a large number of enemies and recovered their hometown. From these steel-like heroic figures, it is fully demonstrated that the Korean nation is a heroic nation that no enemy can defeat. These glorious images, defending the independence and freedom of the motherland, and at the same time defending world peace, powerfully inspire people who oppose imperialist aggression.

The war against American imperialist aggression depicted in the film is a war of the entire North Korean people. Everyone contributed their strength to this war. Even the old farmer Cui Daju, who initially had some conservative ideas, also killed the enemy when the enemy insulted his daughter-in-law and joined the guerrillas. The guerrilla captain Li Yunyi asked Cui Daju: "The guerrillas sleep in the open every day, and have to walk dozens of miles of mountain roads overnight, can you bear it?" Cui Daju expressed his determination: "Don't look at me being a bit old, what am I afraid of! The gun, I seized it from the devils, and I also carried the grain. . . ." He contributed all his strength for his motherland.

The film exposes the enemy's bloody crimes. Peaceful villages are submerged in artillery fire, and unarmed Korean people are massacred in batches. Even babies in swaddling clothes were not spared, and were shot to death in their mother's arms. They wanted to subdue the Korean people with bloody means, but what they got was a shameful failure.

The film "Defend the Homeland" praises the revolutionary heroism and patriotism of the Korean people, and proves that no matter how powerful the enemy is, they can only suffer a shameful defeat in front of such people—this has been proven by the facts today.

    英勇的朝鲜人民的形象
    ——朝鲜影片“保卫家乡”观后

    继朝鲜影片“我的故乡”“少年游击队”“重返前线”之后，中国观众又从银幕上看到了表现朝鲜人民的革命英雄主义和爱国主义精神的影片“保卫家乡”。朝鲜的电影艺术工作者，在战时极困难的条件下，进行工作，把朝鲜人民在抗击美帝国主义侵略的斗争中的可歌可泣的英雄事迹，再现在银幕上，这件事情本身，就是令人感动的。我们从在中国放映过的几部朝鲜影片里，看到年轻的朝鲜人民电影事业，是遵循着正确的现实主义的道路在前进着。这些影片证明了朝鲜电影艺术家们对于正在战斗的祖国人民有着深刻的理解。
    “保卫家乡”所描写的是北朝鲜的一个小村庄，其中的人物都是些普通的朝鲜农民。许多生动的画面使我们看到了朝鲜的壮丽国土和朝鲜民族的英雄气概。影片扼要地描写了朝鲜农民在解放前后的自由幸福的生活，表现了获得幸福生活的人们抗击敌人的无穷尽的力量。无论是影片中的主角李云一（劳动党里细胞委员长）和他的妻子金顺德（里妇女同盟委员长），或是老农民崔大叔，以及所有的朝鲜农民，都曾经饱受过日本帝国主义和地主的压迫和剥削。李云一和金顺德曾经被逼得走头无路，在深山荒野里以打猎为生。北朝鲜解放后，他们才获得了新生，开荒生产，用双手建造了幸福生活。农民们载歌载舞，庆祝丰收。他们在李云一领导下，学习政治和文化。儿童们开始愉快地上学，青年人对于未来怀着远大的理想。年轻姑娘朴英顺想学牧畜，要把朝鲜的草原都变成牧场，让每个人都穿上件羊毛衣；朴英顺的爱人金达浩，想把他的祖国建设得像苏联一样富强，建设巨大的工厂，使农业机械化。就在朝鲜人民看到自己的生活一天天提高，并对未来充满光明的理想的时候，美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚，向北朝鲜开始了武装侵略。朝鲜人民为了保卫祖国的独立和自由，与敌人进行了英勇的战斗。我们看到影片里描写了朝鲜人民军的英雄姿态，他们在极短几天内，以排山倒海之势，把胆敢挑动战争的美李匪帮压到朝鲜南部地区的一个小角落里。美帝国主义者在这时聚集了大批兵力，再次进犯北朝鲜。朝鲜人民军为了战略上的原因，暂时向后撤退了。李云一的村子就暂时被敌人侵占。朝鲜劳动党组织了敌后的游击队。李云一和金顺德等组成的一支游击队，破坏敌人的交通运输，烧毁敌人的仓库，袭击敌人的司令部，解救被捕的爱国同胞，最后破坏了敌人的通讯连络，使预备逃走的敌人全部就歼。游击队有力地配合了朝鲜人民军的军事行动。
    影片在描写这支游击队的活动时，着力地刻划了游击队员的机智和勇敢。他们最初没有枪枝武器，以后从敌人手里夺了来。敌人把农民的粮食抢了去，准备运走，游击队以巧妙的方法消灭了敌人。他们把传单贴在敌人的司令部周围，召唤那些暂时还受着敌人统治的祖国同胞，组织起来反抗敌人。这些情节的描写是紧凑的，生动的。从这里，我们看到了朝鲜人民的崇高的爱国主义和革命英雄主义精神。尤其李云一在一次战斗中，英勇顽强地抗击敌人，掩护游击队转移，最后壮烈牺牲的镜头，给我们留下了深刻的印象。他的妻子金顺德继承了他的领导工作，以同样坚强的战斗精神，歼灭了大量敌人，收复了他们的故乡。从这些钢铁般的英雄人物身上，很充分地表现了朝鲜民族是任何敌人也打不倒的英雄民族。这些为保卫祖国独立、自由，同时也是保卫世界和平的光辉的形象，有力地鼓舞着反对帝国主义侵略的人们。
    影片所描写的抗击美帝国主义侵略的战争，是北朝鲜全民的战争。每个人都为这战争献出了自己的力量。连最初有些保守思想的老农民崔大叔，也在敌人侮辱他的儿媳妇时，砍死了敌人，参加到游击队里来了。游击队的队长李云一问崔大叔：“游击队每天睡露天地，一夜得走几十里山路，你能受得了吗？”崔大叔表示了他的决心：“别看我上点年纪，怕什么！枪，我是从鬼子手里夺来的，粮食也背来了。……”他为了他的祖国，贡献出了他的一切力量。
    影片揭露了敌人血腥的罪行，和平的村庄淹没在炮火里，手无寸铁的朝鲜人民被整批的屠杀。连襁褓的婴儿也不能幸免，被他们打死在母亲怀里。他们想用血腥手段制服朝鲜人民，但他们所得到的是可耻的失败。
    “保卫家乡”这部影片歌颂了朝鲜人民的革命英雄主义和爱国主义精神，无论任何强大的敌人在这样的人民面前只能得到可耻的失败，——这是今天已经被事实证明了的。
