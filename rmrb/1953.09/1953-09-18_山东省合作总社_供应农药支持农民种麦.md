Shandong Provincial Cooperative Federation

Supplying Pesticides to Support Farmers in Wheat Planting

    The Shandong Provincial Cooperative Federation is actively supplying pesticides such as arsenic trioxide and "666" to support farmers in planting wheat.

    In order to not miss the agricultural season and promptly supply farmers' needs, the Shandong Provincial Cooperative Federation signed supply contracts with the county-level cooperative associations as early as April, and organized the procurement of goods according to the planned quantities of each county. Starting from early August, the Shandong Provincial Cooperative Federation began to allocate various pesticides used for autumn planting to cooperative associations throughout the province in advance, according to the contracts. According to incomplete statistics, the pesticides that have been transferred to cooperative associations in various regions now include more than 660,000 jin of arsenic trioxide, 90,000 jin of arsenic concentrate, more than 30,000 jin of "666", and more than 6,000 jin of "Ceresan."

    The Shandong Provincial Cooperative Federation attaches great importance to the quality and specifications of pesticides. A portion of the arsenic trioxide purchased from the Hunan Native Produce Company did not meet the specifications stipulated in the contract, and the provincial federation processed it before allocating it to the county federations. The price of pesticides is also relatively low. For example, the market price of "666" is 20,000 yuan per jin, while the cooperative sells it for more than 14,000 yuan per jin.

### 山东省合作总社  供应农药支持农民种麦

    山东省合作总社
    供应农药支持农民种麦
    山东省合作总社积极供应信石、“六六六”等农药，支持农民播种小麦。
    山东省合作总社为了不违农时，及时供应农民需要，早在四月份就和各县联社签订了供应合同，根据各县计划数量，有计划地组织进货。从八月上旬开始，山东省合作总社便按照合同，提前向省内各地合作社调拨秋种中使用的各种农药。据不完全统计，现已调至各地合作社的农药，计信石六十六万余斤，信精九万斤，“六六六”三万多斤，“西力生”六千余斤。
    山东省合作总社对农药的质量、规格很重视。从湖南土产公司购进的一部分信石，不合合同中规定的规格，该省社进行加工后才调拨给各县社。农药价格也比较便宜。如“六六六”市价每斤两万元，合作社出售价格是每斤一万四千余元。
