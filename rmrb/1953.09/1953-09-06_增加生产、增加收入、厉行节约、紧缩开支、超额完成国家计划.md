Increase Production, Increase Income, Practice Strict Economy, Tighten Expenditures, Overfulfill the National Plan

This year is the first year of our country's first Five-Year Plan. Completing this year's plan is of extremely significant importance to our country's current and long-term construction, and to its influence at home and abroad. Therefore, we must increase production, increase income, practice strict economy, and tighten expenditures to ensure the victorious and overfulfilled completion of the national plan.

Thanks to the active efforts of the vast number of workers, farmers, and cadres at all levels, the implementation of the national economic plan in the first half of this year has been generally satisfactory. However, it should be pointed out that the plan completion of individual industrial production departments is not good enough; some financial and economic departments have not completed their profit remittance plans; and agricultural harvests will be affected in some areas due to drought or floods. We need to pay close attention to these situations.

In terms of industrial production: the total industrial output value in the first half of this year exceeded the national plan; but it should be pointed out that some industrial products did not meet the plan, some products were of poor quality, and some departments did not complete their plans to reduce costs. The central industrial ministries and local enterprises generally did not complete the planned remittance of profits and depreciation fees well enough. Therefore, in the industrial sector, we need to make even greater efforts to ensure the comprehensive and overfulfilled completion of the national plan.

In terms of basic construction: the plan completion in the first half of the year was generally good. However, since construction started later this year, most projects still need to be completed through hard work in the second half of the year; and this will require enormous effort.

In terms of agricultural production: Due to disasters in some areas, the autumn harvest in these areas may result in reduced yields this year. Therefore, the tasks on the food front remain arduous, and we must pay close attention to increasing the harvest of this year's crops, controlling grain, and saving grain.

In terms of state-owned commerce: Due to insufficient market estimates and some improper measures in the first half of this year, the total sales completed were too low. In the second half of the year, due to market expansion, it is necessary to greatly exceed the figures of the first half of the year in order to meet market needs.

In terms of taxation: Although the planned tasks were completed in the first half of the year, it is necessary to complete nearly more than half of the annual plan in the second half of the year, which also requires great efforts.

The above is the general situation in the current financial and economic work, and doing everything possible to overfulfill the national plan, increase production, increase income, practice strict economy, and tighten expenditures is the most urgent task in the current financial and economic work.

In order to accomplish the above tasks, the following measures must be taken:

In terms of increasing production and increasing income:

First of all, increasing production and overfulfilling the national plan is the main source of increasing income. In industrial production and transportation, we must mobilize the masses to complete the first annual plan of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. It is recommended that each industrial ministry and local party committee conduct an in-depth mobilization and inspection of this. Every factory, mine, and transportation enterprise should mobilize and organize the masses to tap potential, find tricks, promote advanced experience, and propose effective measures and methods to complete and overfulfill the national plan; at the same time, actively improve enterprise management, strengthen planning management, implement job plans, and establish and improve the responsibility system, to achieve the purpose of increasing production, overfulfilling production plans, and remitting profits. In industrial production, for products where raw materials and sales are guaranteed, and in the transportation industry, in places where there are abundant sources of goods, with the approval of the higher-level management organs, production increase plans should be proposed. When completing and overfulfilling production plans, not only should attention be paid to the completion of product quantity, but also special attention should be paid to improving quality, reducing costs, and saving raw materials, to create more wealth for the country, to increase national income. In terms of agricultural production, all effective measures should be taken and the masses should be mobilized to increase grain yields. In some drought-stricken areas in the south, where possible, the masses should be organized to rush-plant and replant late autumn crops; in some waterlogged areas in the north, the masses should be organized to drain accumulated water and rescue crops. All localities must lead the autumn harvest and autumn planting work well, and do everything possible to increase the harvest of grain and other crops. At the same time, on the premise that farmers increase grain production, we should strive to complete the predetermined plan for the collection of agricultural taxes in accordance with the tax rate, and implement tax reductions and exemptions for households in difficulty in accordance with the law. For disaster-stricken areas, it is necessary to accurately ascertain the disaster situation, properly resettle the victims, mobilize the masses in the disaster areas to produce for self-help, and prevent famine next spring. Government relief must be mainly focused on severely affected areas and the most urgent needs, and appropriately controlled within a certain limit.

Secondly, vigorously organize the exchange of goods. State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives should actively and systematically organize purchases (especially the purchase of grain, cotton, and daily consumer industrial products), expand sales, accelerate capital turnover, and reduce circulation costs. This can not only promote the development of industrial and agricultural production but also open up tax sources and accumulate funds for the country from the commercial sector. The views of some comrades in the commercial sector who neglect saving expenses and neglect remitting profits should continue to be corrected. Trade departments should pay special attention to controlling grain, cotton, and other cash crops to ensure market stability.

Thirdly, do a good job in tax collection. It is necessary to ensure the completion of the tax collection plan and increase tax revenue with the development of production, the expansion of material exchanges, and the in-depth struggle against tax evasion. We must pay attention to implementing policies, and continue to correct the tendency of policies being divorced from tasks existing in tax leadership organs and tax staff, especially to take effective measures to prevent tax evasion. Party committees and financial departments at all levels must strengthen their leadership over tax work, and any tendency to relax tax work is wrong.

In terms of practicing strict economy and tightening expenditures:

In addition to the various economic organs and their subordinate enterprises, and the various administrative departments and their subordinate units taking effective measures to practice strict economy, first, all departments must resolutely reduce those appropriations for undertakings that can be reduced, postponed, or are optional; second, streamline administrative organizations and save administrative expenses. The personnel originally planned to be increased in national institutions at all levels this year will no longer be increased, and redundant personnel must be streamlined and reduced in a planned and appropriate manner to save expenditures; individual adjustments that must be made should be carried out under the conditions of streamlined staffing; third, mobilize party members, government officials, soldiers, and civilians, especially farmers, to pay attention to saving grain, and organs and troops should put forward specific measures and specific requirements for saving grain.

It must be pointed out here that the measures to tighten expenditures should not be understood as passive methods. We are resolutely reducing those miscellaneous projects precisely to concentrate our efforts on major construction projects. We will make our greatest efforts to ensure the completion of those basic construction projects that play a decisive role in our country's industrial construction and some necessary projects that can rapidly increase production capacity.

It must also be pointed out here that the tendency of not strictly controlling expenditures and relaxing financial supervision that may grow and has already grown in the financial departments must be strictly prevented and resolutely corrected.

It is now September, time is very tight, and party organizations at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party should, with great effort, cooperate with the central departments and governments at all levels to carefully check the various items of income and expenditure this year, in order to mobilize the whole party and the entire people, carry forward positive factors, overcome negative factors, and boost our energy to increase production, practice strict economy, and expand income, so as to ensure the victorious and overfulfilled completion of the 1953 national economic annual plan. At the same time, it is recommended that the central ministries and various regions should draw on this year's experiences and lessons, master the policy of increasing production, practicing strict economy, focusing on key construction projects, and advancing steadily, use a realistic and pragmatic approach, avoid subjectivism, and actively prepare and compile the various plans for 1954.

We firmly believe that, thanks to the high degree of enthusiasm shown by the vast number of workers, farmers, and cadres at all levels in welcoming the country's first Five-Year Plan, thanks to our party's rich experience and indomitable perseverance in overcoming various difficulties, and thanks to the huge potential forces that still exist in all aspects, as long as party organizations and cadres at all levels maintain a clear mind, strengthen ties with the masses, rely on the masses, and conscientiously implement the party's policies; give full play to the wisdom of the whole party, be good at grasping key points, tap potential, and accurately calculate and control income and expenditure, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and victoriously and overfulfill this year's construction plan.

    增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支、超额完成国家计划
    今年是我国第一个五年计划的头一个年度。完成今年的计划，无论对于我国当前的和长远的建设事业来说，无论对于国内外的影响来说，都是有极其重大的意义的。因此，必须增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支，以保证国家计划胜利地、超额地完成。
    由于广大工人、农民和各级干部的积极努力，今年上半年国民经济计划的执行情况，一般说来，是比较令人满意的。但是，应该指出：个别工业生产部门的计划完成情况还不够好；某些财经部门的利润上缴计划没有完成；农业因有些地区遭受天旱或水灾，收成将有所影响。这些情况，都需要我们加以十分的注意。
    工业生产方面：今年上半年的工业总产值是超额完成了国家计划的；但是应该指出：有几种工业产品没有完成计划，有些产品质量不好，有些部门没有完成降低成本的计划。中央各工业部及地方企业完成上缴利润及折旧费计划的情况，一般地说，完成得还不够好。因此，在工业方面，还需要以更大的努力来保证全面地、超额地完成国家计划。
    基本建设方面：上半年计划完成的情况，一般说还好。但是，由于今年开工较晚，因此，大部分工程还有待于下半年来努力完成；而这是要化极大的力量才能办到的。
    农业生产方面：由于某些地区遭受灾害，今年这些地区的秋收，可能减少产量。因此，今后在粮食战线上的任务，还是艰巨的，必须十分注意提高今年农作物的收获量，掌握粮食和节约粮食。
    国营商业方面：今年上半年因对市场估计不足，有些措施失当，完成销售总额过少，下半年由于市场扩大，必须大大地超过上半年的数字，才能适应市场的需要。
    税收方面：虽然上半年完成了计划任务，但是下半年内，要完成将近全年计划的过半数，这同样需要作很大的努力。
    上述这些，就是当前财政经济工作中的一般情况，而尽一切可能超额完成国家计划，增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支，就是当前在财政经济工作方面最迫切的任务。
    为了完成上述任务，必须采取以下措施：
    在增加生产、增加收入方面：
    首先是增加生产，超额完成国家计划，这是增加收入主要的源泉。在工业生产和交通运输方面，要发动群众提前完成五年计划的第一个年度计划。建议各个工业部和各地党委对此进行一次深入的动员和检查。每一个厂矿、交通运输的企业，都应发动和组织群众，挖掘潜力，寻找窍门，推广先进经验，提出完成和超额完成国家计划的有效措施和办法；同时要积极改善企业的管理工作，加强计划管理，推行作业计划，建立和健全责任制度，以达到增加生产、超额完成生产计划与上缴利润的目的。在工业生产中，凡原料和销路均有保证的产品，在运输业中，凡货源多的地方，经过上级管理机关的批准，均应提出增产的计划。在完成和超额完成生产计划时，不仅要注意产品数量的完成，而且要特别注意提高质量，降低成本，节约原材料，为国家创造更多的财富，以增加国家收入。在农业生产方面，应采取一切有效措施并动员群众增加粮食的收获量。在南方某些旱灾地区，凡有可能时即应组织群众抢种、补种晚秋作物；在北方某些水涝地区，要组织群众排除积水，抢救庄稼。各地都要很好地领导秋收、秋种工作，尽一切可能提高粮食和其他农作物的收获量。同时，在农民增加粮食产量的前提下争取农业税的征收按照税率完成预定计划，并对困难户实行依法减免。对于受灾地区，要确实弄清灾情，妥善安置灾民，发动灾区群众生产自救，并预防明年春荒。政府的救济，必须主要放在重灾区和最迫切需要的方面，并适当控制在一定限度以内。
    其次是大力组织物资交流，国营商业部门与供销合作社应积极地有计划地组织收购（特别是粮食、棉花和日常消费工业品的收购），扩大推销，并加速资金周转，减低流转费用。这样不仅可以推动工农业生产的发展，而且可以开辟税源，并从商业方面给国家积累资金。商业部门中某些同志忽视节约费用的观点与忽视上缴利润的观点，应继续予以纠正。贸易部门要特别注意掌握粮食、棉花及其他经济作物，以保证市场的稳定。
    再次是做好税收工作。要保证完成税收计划，并随着生产的发展，物资交流的扩大和反偷漏斗争的深入而增加税收。要注意贯彻政策，要继续纠正在税务领导机关和税务工作人员中存在着的政策与任务脱节的偏向，特别是要采取有效措施防止偷税漏税。各级党委及财政部门必须加强对税收工作的领导，任何放松税收工作的偏向，都是错误的。
    在厉行节约、紧缩开支方面：
    除各个经济机关和所属企业、各个行政部门和所属单位应采取有效措施，厉行节约以外，第一，一切部门，都要坚决削减那些可以削减的，可以推迟的，或可办可不办的事业拨款；第二，精简行政机构，节约行政经费。原拟今年在国家各级机构中增加的人员，不再增加，并须有计划地妥善地精减冗员，节约开支；个别必须增加的，在精简编制的条件下，进行调整；第三，动员党政军民特别是农民注意节约粮食，机关、部队要提出节约粮食的具体措施和具体要求。
    这里必须指出：不应把紧缩开支的措施了解为消极的办法，我们坚决削减那些杂七杂八的项目，正是为了集中力量于主要的建设事业。对于我国工业建设起决定作用的那些基本建设工程和能够迅速增长生产能力的某些必要的工程，我们将以最大的努力来保证其完成。
    这里还必须指出：财政部门中可能滋长和已经滋长的不严格控制开支与放松财务监督的偏向，必须严加防止，坚决纠正。
    现在已是九月，时间已很紧，中国共产党各级党的组织应以很大的力量，协同中央各部门与各级政府，对今年各项收入和支出逐项地加以认真检查，以便动员全党和全体人民，发扬积极因素，克服消极因素，鼓起劲来，增加生产，厉行节约，扩大收入，以保证一九五三年国民经济年度计划胜利的超额的完成。同时，建议中央各部及各地区应吸取今年的经验和教训，掌握增加生产、厉行节约、重点建设、稳步前进的方针，以实事求是的方法，避免主观主义，积极准备和编制一九五四年的各项计划。
    我们深信：由于广大工人、农民和各级干部为迎接国家的第一个五年计划所表现出的高度的积极性，由于我党有着克服各种困难的丰富经验和坚忍不拔的毅力，由于我们在各方面尚存在着巨大的潜在力量，只要各级党的组织和各级干部，保持清醒的头脑，加强与群众的联系，依靠群众，很好地贯彻党的政策；发扬全党的智慧，善于抓住关键、发掘潜力，精确地计算和掌握收入与支出，我们就一定能够克服一切困难，胜利地、超额地完成今年的建设计划。
