Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th - At the POW Repatriation Commission meeting on September 7th, the US representative, Mr. Fredericksdaugh, blatantly overturned the promise to unconditionally repatriate all Korean and Chinese captured personnel who insisted on repatriation. He claimed that all Korean and Chinese captured personnel who insisted on repatriation had been sent back on the 6th, and refused to repatriate a large number of our captured personnel who were still forcibly detained by the US side.

Recently, the Korean-Chinese side submitted three lists to the US side of our captured personnel forcibly detained by the US side who insisted on repatriation, including 644 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and 152 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Our side has ample evidence to prove that these people firmly demand repatriation. The US representative has repeatedly stated at meetings of the Military Armistice Commission and the POW Repatriation Commission that it would unconditionally repatriate all Korean and Chinese captured personnel who insisted on repatriation. US Secretary of State Dulles also stated on September 2 that the US side would fulfill the agreement to repatriate all POWs who insisted on repatriation.

However, after carefully checking the lists against the Korean and Chinese captured personnel who had already been repatriated, 245 of the Korean and Chinese captured personnel listed in these lists who insisted on repatriation had not been repatriated, including 228 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and 17 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. At the POW Repatriation Commission meeting on the 7th, Colonel Li Pingyi, the chief commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side, submitted the list of these 245 people to the US side, demanding that the US side repatriate all of them. Colonel Li Pingyi questioned the US side: Why are you still detaining a large number of our captured personnel who insist on repatriation? When are you going to repatriate them all? The US representative did not respond to this question.

The Korean-Chinese side representative also quoted a public statement by US Secretary of the Army Stevens, pointing out that the US side has forcibly detained at least 112 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Stevens publicly admitted on August 13 that the US side had detained 250 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and said that they would be detained until the final exchange of prisoners of war. Since August 14, the US side has only repatriated 138 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers on September 6. The Korean-Chinese side representative pointed out: Stevens' statement represents the senior US authorities, and the US side cannot overturn this statement that the whole world knows. He asked where these 112 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who insisted on repatriation had gone, and demanded a clear answer from the US side.

US representative Colonel Fredericksdaugh was unable to deny the statement made by US Secretary of the Army Stevens, so he had to escape answering by proposing an adjournment.

Sources here point out that the Korean-Chinese side has completed the repatriation of all American POWs who insisted on repatriation under its custody. The US side has the responsibility to repatriate all of our captured personnel who they are forcibly detaining and who insist on repatriation. The whole world is watching whether the US side will fulfill the promises made by official US representatives, including US Secretary of State Dulles.

    美方悍然扣留大批坚持遣返的我方被俘人员
    我方在战俘遣返委员会上要美方明确交代
    【新华社开城七日电】在九月七日战俘遣返委员会的会议上，美方代表弗莱德斯达夫公然推翻无例外地遣返一切坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员的诺言，声称一切坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员已在六日遣送完毕，拒绝遣返大批仍然被美方强迫扣留着的坚持遣返的我方被俘人员。
    朝中方面最近曾三次向美方提出被美方强迫扣留的坚持遣返的我方被俘人员名单，其中包括朝鲜人民军被俘人员六百四十四人，中国人民志愿军被俘人员一百五十二人。我方有充分的材料证明这些人是坚决要求遣返的。美方代表在军事停战委员会以及战俘遣返委员会的会议上，曾经一再声称将无例外地遣返一切坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员。美国国务卿杜勒斯在九月二日也表示，美方将履行遣返一切坚持遣返的战俘的协议。
    但是，在将名单与已经遣返归来的朝中被俘人员仔细核对以后，这些名单中所列举的坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员，还有二百四十五人没有遣返，其中有朝鲜人民军被俘人员二百二十八人，中国人民志愿军被俘人员十七人。在战俘遣返委员会七日会议上，朝中方面首席委员李平一上校把这二百四十五人的名单提交给了美方，要求美方将他们全部遣返。李平一上校质问美方：为甚么到现在你方还要扣留大批坚持遣返的我方被俘人员？你方准备在甚么时候将他们全部遣返？美方代表对这一质问没有作任何回答。
    朝中方面代表并引用美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯的公开声明，指出美方至少还强迫扣留了中国人民志愿军被俘人员一百一十二人。斯蒂文斯在八月十三日公开承认美方扣留了中国人民志愿军被俘人员二百五十人，并说要把他们扣留到交换战俘的最后。从八月十四日以来，美方只在九月六日遣返了中国人民志愿军被俘人员一百三十八人。朝中方面代表指出：斯蒂文斯的声明是代表美国高级当局的，美方不能推翻这一个全世界都知道的声明。他追问这一百一十二名坚持遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员到那里去了，并要求美方作明白的答复。
    美方代表弗莱德斯达夫上校无法否认美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯的声明，他只好用提议休会来逃避回答。
    此间人士指出，朝中方面已经将在其收容下的坚持遣返的美方战俘全部遣返完毕，美方有责任把他们所强迫扣留的坚持遣返的我方被俘人员全部予以遣返，全世界都注视着美方是否履行包括美国国务卿杜勒斯在内的美国官方代表所提出的诺言。
