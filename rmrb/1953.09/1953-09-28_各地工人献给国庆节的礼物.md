Workers Across the Country Present Gifts to Celebrate National Day

    Li Xikui's Shunting Team Exceeds its National Day Gift Plan
    The national railway shunting team banner—the Shenyang Station Li Xikui Shunting Team—formulated a National Day gift plan in early September and launched a competition to celebrate National Day. The team originally had six members, but because some of them participated in the inspection work team for collective contracts, only four remained. However, due to their study and implementation of the advanced experience of the former Sino-Soviet Railway, and their improvement of the high-tech gravity shunting method, the Li Xikui Shunting Method continued to be consolidated and improved. As a result, four people completed the tasks of six. Whenever they had time, they held meetings to study shortcomings and problems in their work and promptly found solutions. The team's National Day gift plan was exceeded in early September. The average train formation time was only 26 minutes, and the train dismantling time averaged 20 minutes, which was 343 car-hours shorter than the original target set by Shenyang Station, saving the country a significant amount of wealth.

    Bai Shuanbao's Team Completes Plan 11 Days Ahead of Schedule
    The Bai Shuanbao Team of the Western Mining Department of the Longyan Iron Mine, with practical actions to welcome National Day, on September 19, 11 days ahead of schedule, fully and evenly exceeded the state plan by 0.98% on a shift, daily, and weekly basis. All team members said they would never be arrogant and would create more wealth for the country, ensuring that they would complete another 17 meters of tunneling by the end of the month.
    Anshan Iron and Steel Complex's Initial Rolling Mill Trial-Produces Nine Pieces of Mechanized and Automated Equipment
    The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex's Initial Rolling Mill decided to successfully trial-produce nine pieces of mechanized and automated equipment in September, including an automatic scale for the charging machine, an automatic valve changer for the soaking pit, and an automatic iron scale remover for the No. 1 rolling mill roller table, and put them into production as a gift for National Day.
    Zhang Shoujin, the dedicated technician of the Rationalization Proposal Team, and the leadership of the Electrical Repair Workshop jointly studied and formulated an engineering progress plan. According to the types of work required for each piece of mechanized and automated equipment, they divided the work and assigned specific personnel to each item for construction. The workshop finally included the construction plan for the mechanized and automated equipment in the September production work plan. By September 8, five pieces of mechanized and automated equipment, including the automatic iron scale remover for the No. 1 rolling mill roller table, the automatic valve changer for the No. 1 soaking pit, the improvement of the iron scale car track in the rolling mill central trench, and the automatic baffle at the entrance of the 18-stand continuous rolling mill, were completed. After a mid-term repair, they can be installed and put into production. Of the other four pieces, two have been completed and will be installed after testing, and two are still under research and trial production.

    Huaibei Salt Field Completes September Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    The vast number of salt workers at the state-owned Huaibei Salt Field enthusiastically launched a production increase and economy campaign to welcome National Day. The Lu Detie Team of the Fourth Row and Fourth Polder of the Pugang Station in Guantong Field completed 113.2% of the autumn production task by September 18. The next day, they revised their labor competition plan. Lu Detie, the production team leader, said: "We will strive to complete this plan as a gift to National Day!" Everyone unanimously guaranteed that from September 20 to the end of the month, they would increase production by 5,000 dan of salt in ten days. By September 20, the entire salt field had completed the September production plan ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by 133.19%. (Yang Dongye, Chen Jing, Qin Jun)
    Feng Baizhong Improves Production Efficiency Sevenfold
    During the production increase and economy campaign, the workers of the Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Mine Repair and Assembly Plant received an urgent task to plane "drill bit joints" for the mine engineering company. The mine estimated that one worker in one shift could plane two. When worker Feng Baizhong was doing this work, he held the joint in his hand, looked at the teeth on it, and counted that there were forty teeth. Planing the teeth was the most time-consuming work, and while planing, he had to find the line; if he wasn't careful, the work would not meet the specifications. Feng Baizhong put down the joint and thought: Planing two a day is too slow, how can that meet the needs of exploration? We must find a way to improve efficiency. He picked up a forty-tooth gear used on the planer and found that it was the same as the teeth on the joint. He used the forty-tooth gear to make a jig, and also installed a safety gate next to the gear to avoid wrong teeth. When planing, he didn't need to find the line, it was fast and could guarantee quality. When he started using this new tool, the workpiece vibrated when the planer was turned on. Feng Baizhong was not afraid of difficulties, so he made a support to prop it up. As a result, the workpiece did not vibrate, and he could plane sixteen joints per shift, improving efficiency sevenfold. He used this achievement as a gift to National Day.

    各地工人献给国庆节的礼物
    李锡奎调车组超额完成了献礼计划
    全国铁路调车组旗帜——沈阳车站李锡奎调车组，为了迎接国庆节，在九月初订出了献礼计划，开展了竞赛。全组本来有六个人，因为有的人参加了检查集体合同的工作组，只剩下四个人。但由于他们学习和贯彻了原中长铁路的先进经验，做好高技术溜放法，使李锡奎调车法继续得到巩固和提高，因此四个人完成了六个人的任务。一有空，他们就开会研究工作中的缺点和问题，及时找出改进办法。小组的国庆节献礼计划已在九月上旬超额完成。编组列车时间平均只二十六分，列车解体时间平均为二十分，比沈阳站原定指标缩短了三百四十三个车小时，给国家节省了大量财富。

    白拴宝小组提前十一天超额完成计划
    龙烟铁矿西部采矿部白拴宝小组，以实际行动迎接国庆节，在九月十九日，提前十一天按班、日、周全面均衡地超额完成了国家计划百分之零点九八。全组工人表示决不骄傲，要为国家创造更多的财富，保证到月底再完成十七公尺的掘进任务。
    鞍钢初轧厂试作九件机械化、自动化设备
    鞍钢初轧厂职工决定在九月份把装入机自动磅秤、均热炉自动变更瓣、压延南一号辊道自动出铁皮等九件机械化、自动化设备试作成功，投入生产，作为给国庆节的献礼。
    合理化建议小组的专责技术员张守金和修理电气工段领导方面共同研究，制订出工程进度计划，并按着每件机械化、自动化设备试作中所需要的工种，进行了分工，专人专件地施工制作。工段最后把机械化、自动化设备的施工计划列入九月份生产工作计划内。到九月八日有压延南一号辊道自动出铁皮、一号均热炉自动变更瓣、压延中地沟铁皮车轨道改进及十八连轧入口自动挡板等五件机械化、自动化设备制作完毕，经过中修后即可安装使用，投入生产。其他四件中，有两件已经作完，经试验后再行安装；有两件正在研究试作。

    淮北盐场提前完成九月份生产计划
    国营淮北盐场广大盐工，为迎接国庆节热烈展开增产节约劳动竞赛。灌东场蒲港所四排四圩卢德铁小组，到九月十八日就完成了秋产任务百分之一百十三点二强，第二天他们又修订了劳动竞赛计划。生产组长卢德铁说：“我们争取完成这个计划，向国庆节献礼！”大家一致保证从九月二十日到月底十天中，要增产五千担盐。到九月二十日，全盐场九月份生产计划已提前完成，还超过计划百分之一百三十三点一九。　（杨东野、陈竞、秦俊）
    冯百中提高了生产效率七倍
    开滦赵各庄矿修配厂职工在增产节约竞赛中，接到一项紧急任务，给矿井工程公司刨“钻头接头”。矿上估工一班一人刨两个。工人冯百忠做这活时，他把接头拿在手里，看着上面的牙齿，数了数有四十个齿；刨牙齿是最费事的活，一边刨一边还得找线，一不留神就会做得不合乎规格。冯百忠放下了接头，心想着：一天刨两个太慢了，那能满足勘探需要呢？一定得想办法提高效率。他顺手拿起刨床上用的四十齿牙轮，发现和接头上的牙齿一样，他就用四十齿牙轮做个胎，牙轮的旁边还安一个保险闸，以免错了齿，刨时不用找线，又快又能保证质量。开始使用这个新工具时，刨床一开，工作物就震动，冯百忠不怕困难，就又做了一个支柱支上，结果工作物不震动了，每班可以刨十六个接头，提高效率七倍。他用这个成绩来给国庆节献礼。
