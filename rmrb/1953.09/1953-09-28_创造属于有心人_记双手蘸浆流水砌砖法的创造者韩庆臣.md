Creation Belongs to the Attentive
    -- On Han Qingchen, Creator of the Double-Handed Slurry Dipping Bricklaying Method
    By Our Correspondent Chang Gong

    The No. 15 and 16 coke oven project, which started on July 1st this year, is a part of the No. 7 blast furnace system project of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. According to the national plan, this project was to be completed by the end of September this year, but it encountered a major difficulty. The project required more than 10,000 tons of refractory bricks, with at least 180 tons to be laid daily to complete on schedule. However, there were very few skilled workers at the time. Out of every group of sixteen people, there were only one or two experienced workers. Due to the low technical level, they could only lay about 80 tons per day at most. This meant a delay of more than three months, which would greatly affect other projects. The soon-to-be-completed No. 7 blast furnace needed its coke for production, and the large rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant also needed its gas. What to do? Xu Xing, the manager of the Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company, convened many special meetings to solve this problem, but to no avail.

    It was at this moment—on July 17th—that worker Han Qingchen created an advanced method of laying refractory bricks, increasing work efficiency threefold while maintaining 100% quality. Soviet expert Comrade Baukoff believed that this new creation was a significant contribution to industrial furnace construction engineering.

    Regarding worker Han Qingchen's creation, one can hear the following story from cadres and workers by simply visiting the construction site of the No. 15 and 16 coke ovens: In the afternoon of July 17th, Han Qingchen invited Section Chief Wang Runzhi of the Engineering Department to the construction site. They were seen talking about something. Section Chief Wang Runzhi then walked to the furnace wall and began laying bricks with a trowel, while Han Qingchen stood by watching. After a short while, Section Chief Wang Runzhi put down the trowel and said to Han Qingchen, "I don't think I can do it. You try." Han Qingchen replied, "Okay, let me try." He then picked up a refractory brick with his left hand, poured the silica slurry from the trowel onto the furnace wall with his right hand, spread it with the trowel, dipped the brick, which had only been daubed a few times, into the spread silica slurry a few times, and then laid it on the furnace wall. This brick was not only laid quickly, but the joints were also filled with slurry, making it very sturdy. Seeing that this brick was better than those laid usually, he quickly called to Section Chief Wang Runzhi: "Look, is this brick okay?" Section Chief Wang Runzhi walked over and examined it carefully, then said happily: "Yes, good quality." He then called the workers to come and see, and everyone said that the brick was well laid.

    Han Qingchen looked at the brick carefully again and again, his confidence growing. So he continued to experiment with the dipping method. First, he laid the bottom ash, then discarded the trowel and used his hands to take the brick, dip it in the silica slurry basin, and lay it on the furnace wall. It was really fast and good. He then convened a meeting of all the workers in the group to solicit their opinions. Many workers at the time said that this method was good, but in order to give full play to the effectiveness of this method, the labor organization must be changed. So he divided the sixteen workers in the group into two subgroups, and each subgroup was divided into brick arranging, ash spreading, bricklaying, seam pointing, and cleaning, etc., implementing parallel assembly line operations.

    The next morning, all the workers in the group arrived. He said to all the workers in the group: "If we can succeed in the experiment today, we will solve the company's difficulties and ensure the completion of the project on schedule." Everyone was immediately invigorated by his words and began experimenting with the new method. As a result, the superiority of this new method was demonstrated in the laying of the first row of bricks. In the past, it would take at least an hour and a half to lay a row of bricks, and the quality could not be guaranteed. Now, it only took twenty-nine minutes to lay the same row of bricks, and the quality reached 100%. At this time, Deputy Manager Zhang Lianwen of the company and Soviet expert Comrade Baukoff arrived, watching their trial of the new method and giving them greater encouragement. After watching their performance, Soviet expert Comrade Baukoff and Deputy Manager Zhang Lianwen repeatedly praised them.

    Worker Han Qingchen's creation is not mysterious at all. He said to me: "Our construction today is for the happiness of tomorrow. If everyone can put their heart into the construction, won't happiness come faster?" And he acted according to what he said. He is from Dacheng, Hebei, thirty-one years old this year, and has eighteen years of work experience. In the past, he experienced countless hardships; his mother and sister died of hunger and cold. But after liberation, he began a life of unprecedented happiness. Therefore, he was particularly active and attentive as soon as he started working. After he was approved to join the glorious Communist Party of China in April 1950, he devoted everything to the Party. No matter how arduous the tasks the Party gave him, he was always able to complete them ahead of schedule or on schedule. After Anshan Iron and Steel Company began its basic construction in April 1952, he created many construction methods and solved many difficulties in the restoration of the No. 17 and 18 coke ovens and the heating furnace of the seamless steel pipe plant, because he was very attentive to the projects, and was selected as a labor model of the whole company.

    This year, he was transferred to the construction site of the No. 15 and 16 coke ovens. At the groundbreaking ceremony on July 1st, he heard Manager Xu Xing say: "The No. 15 and 16 coke ovens are a very important project. If they cannot be completed on schedule or if the project quality is poor, it will directly affect our country's industrialization." But after the construction that day, due to the small number of experienced workers and the large number of new workers, the technical level was not high; and the project task was very heavy, and it was designed according to advanced Soviet experience, and the technical requirements were very strict. Therefore, it was often impossible to complete the task and guarantee the project quality. He is an administrative group leader and a Communist Party member. His task is to lead all the workers in the group, ensure the project quality, and strive to complete the project ahead of schedule or on schedule. Therefore, he concentrated his efforts on solving the current main difficulty.

    At the beginning, he paid special attention to improving the technical level of the workers. He often took the initiative to give technical lessons to the workers during the time before and after work; during the daily construction process, he personally held everyone's hands to teach; especially on Sundays, he invited the workers to his home to study. However, after more than ten days, he felt that this method was good, but it was a slow process and could not be effective in a short time, nor was it compatible with the overall project requirements. Therefore, while improving the technical level of the workers, he also studied with technician Dai Yinshun to improve tools and operating methods. Later, he also found Engineering Section Chief Wang Runzhi to study together. Engineering Section Chief Wang Runzhi was an experienced refractory bricklayer, so he went with him to conduct on-site experiments. In the afternoon of July 17th, their experiment was successful, creating an advanced method of laying refractory bricks with the double-handed slurry dipping parallel assembly line operation.

    创造属于有心人
    ——记双手蘸浆流水砌砖法的创造者韩庆臣
    本报记者　常工
    今年七月一日开工的十五、十六号炼焦炉工程，是鞍山钢铁公司第七号高炉系统工程中的一项。按照国家计划，这项工程要在今年九月底以前完成，但却遇到了一个很大的困难。因为这项工程共需砌筑耐火砖一万多吨，每天至少要砌筑一百八十吨以上才能如期完工。可是，当时技术工人很少，每组十六个人中，只有一两个老工人。由于技术水平很低，每天最多只能砌筑八十吨左右。这样，要推迟三个多月才能完工，对于其他工程影响极大。即将完工的第七号高炉，开工生产时需要它的焦炭，大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂，也需要它的煤气。怎么办呢？工业筑炉工程公司经理徐行为了解决这个问题，曾经召开过多次专门会议，但是都没有结果。
    就在这个时候——七月十七日，工人韩庆臣创造了砌筑耐火砖的先进方法，工作效率提高到三倍，质量达到百分之百。苏联专家巴乌可夫同志认为他的这一个新创造是对工业筑炉工程的一个重大贡献。
    关于工人韩庆臣的这一创造，只要人们走上十五、十六号炼焦炉工地，就可以从干部和工人的口中，听到这样的故事：七月十七日的下午，韩庆臣邀工程科长王润芝到工地上来，他们不知说些什么，只见工程科长王润芝走到炉墙跟前，就拿上铲子去砌砖，韩庆臣则在旁边站着看。没有多大一会，工程科长王润芝就把铲子一放，对着韩庆臣说：“我看不行，你再试试看。”韩庆臣就说：“好，让我来试试。”接着他左手拿起一块耐火砖，右手就把铲子上的矽浆倒在炉墙上，顺手用铲子一摊，把那块只抹了几下的耐火砖，在摊平的矽浆上蘸了几下，就砌上炉墙。这块耐火砖不但砌的很快，而且砖缝里都挤满了浆，挺结实。他一看这块砖比平时砌的要好，就连忙招呼工程科长王润芝：“你看这块砌的行不行？”工程科长王润芝走上去仔细地看了一遍，便高兴地说：“行，好质量。”接着他就招呼工人们来看，大家也都说这砖砌的好。
    韩庆臣对这块砖仔细地看了又看，信心更大了，于是他就采取蘸浆的办法继续试验下去，先把底灰铺好，扔掉铲子用手拿砖在矽浆盆里蘸了就往炉墙上砌，真是又快又好。接着他就召集全组工人开会，征求大家的意见。当时许多工人都说这个方法好，但要使这个方法充分发挥功效，必须改变一下劳动组织。于是他把全组十六个工人，分成两个小组，每个小组再按工序分成排砖、铺灰、砌砖、抅缝与清扫等，实行平行流水作业。
    第二天一早，全组工人就都来到了。他向全组工人说：“咱们今天要能够试验成功，就给咱们公司解决了困难，保证按期完成工程任务。”大家听他这样一讲，就都立刻振奋起来，按照新方法试验，结果在砌第一趟砖中，这种新方法就显示出它的优越性。过去砌一趟砖，最少也要一个半钟头，并且还不能保证质量。现在砌同样的一趟砖，却只要二十九分钟，并且质量还达到百分之百。这时公司张连文副经理和苏联专家巴乌可夫同志都来了，看他们试行新方法，给予他们更大的鼓励。看过他们表演，苏联专家巴乌可夫同志和张连文副经理都连连称赞。
    工人韩庆臣的这一创造，并没有什么奥妙，他对我说：“我们今天的建设，就是为着明天的幸福。每个人对建设都能用心，幸福不是就能来得更快吗？”而他就是按着他所说的话去作的。他是河北大城人，今年三十一岁，已有十八年的工龄。在过去，他曾经历了无数的困难，他的母亲和妹妹就是死在饥寒交迫中。但在解放以后，他便开始了从未有过的幸福生活。因此，他一开始参加工作，就特别的积极、用心。一九五○年四月，他被批准参加光荣的中国共产党后，他更把自己的一切都交给党，无论党给他的任务多么艰巨，他总是能够提前或按期完成。一九五二年四月，鞍钢开始基本建设后，他在修复十七、十八号炼焦炉和无缝钢管厂的加热炉等工程中，就因为他对工程很用心，曾经先后创造了许多施工方法，解决了许多困难，被选为全公司的劳动模范。
    今年，他被调到十五、十六号炼焦炉工地，在七月一日的施工典礼大会上，他听徐行经理这样说：“十五、十六号炼焦炉是一项很重要的工程，如果不能按期完成，或者工程质量低劣，这都将直接影响到我们国家的工业化。”但在那天施工以后，由于老工人少，新工人多，技术水平不高；而工程任务很繁重，又是按照苏联先进经验设计的，技术上要求也很严格，因此，就经常完不成任务，也保证不了工程质量。他是一个行政小组长，又是一个共产党员，他的任务就是要领导全组工人，保证工程质量，争取提前或按期竣工。因此，他也就把自己的力量都集中在解决当前的这一主要困难上面。
    一开始，他特别关心提高工人的技术水平。经常利用上下班前后的时间，主动地给工人上技术课；在每天的施工过程中，他亲自把着大家的手教；特别是在星期天，他把工人请到他家去学习。但是，经过十多天以后，他却感到这个办法好是好，却是个慢工夫，一时不能收效，也和整个工程要求不相适应。因此，在提高工人技术水平的同时，他又和技术员戴荫荪研究改进工具和操作方法。以后他又找工程科长王润芝一起研究，工程科长王润芝是个砌耐火砖的老工人，就和他一起去实地试验。七月十七日下午，他们的试验成功了，创造出双手蘸浆平行流水作业砌筑耐火砖的先进方法。（附图片）
