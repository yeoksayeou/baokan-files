The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Mobilizes Workers to Launch Production Increase and Economy Practice Competition
Many Factories, Enterprises, and Basic Construction Units' Workers Have Launched Challenges and Responses

[This newspaper reports] The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting on September 12th, gathering responsible cadres from Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in factories, enterprises, and basic construction units throughout the city to deploy the launch of a production increase and economy practice competition. At the meeting, Fang Zhongru, Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a report.

In his report, Fang Zhongru analyzed the progress made by various factories, enterprises, and basic construction units in completing their plans over the past eight months. In order to overcome the current shortcomings in the work and further improve the level of enterprise management, so as to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's national plan, he required Party organizations at all levels to cooperate with administrative authorities at all levels to mobilize all workers, technicians, and staff to launch a production increase and economy practice competition, and to do the following work well: In factories, planning management work should be established and improved, and operation plans should be well-written. The masses should be mobilized to formulate group pacts around the operation plans and launch labor competitions. In conjunction with this work, the work of departments and offices should be further strengthened, and the responsibility system should be improved. In various basic construction units, the focus should be on implementing the construction progress plan, an important aspect, and the masses should be mobilized to discuss and formulate group pacts around the construction progress plan, and launch competitions. On this basis, the masses should be mobilized to gradually establish administrative responsibility systems, construction responsibility systems, technical responsibility systems, and supply responsibility systems, etc., in order to improve management. In addition, Party organizations and trade union organizations at all levels must strengthen ideological and political education work, improve the awareness of the masses, and overcome the phenomenon of lax labor discipline.

Fang Zhongru emphasized that in the production increase and economy practice competition, the concept of comprehensively fulfilling the plan must be implemented, and the tendency to only look at quantity and ignore quality and cost must be prevented, as well as the phenomenon of using excess output to compensate for insufficient quality or using the excess of secondary products to compensate for the insufficiency of primary products in order to superficially complete the task. Secondly, in the course of the competition, great attention must also be paid to the lives and safety of the workers. Fang Zhongru finally called on the workers of all factories, enterprises, and basic construction units in the city to give play to their enthusiasm and creativity and strive to complete and over-fulfill this year's national plan.

Zhang Jianying, the representative of Factory 603, on behalf of all the workers of the factory, proposed the conditions for strengthening planning management, preparing operation plans, and increasing production and practicing economy for the country by 4 billion yuan, and challenged the workers of all factories, enterprises, and basic construction units in the city. Xi'an People's Flour Mill and other units have successively put forward response conditions, guaranteeing the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's national plan.

    中共西安市委动员职工开展增产节约竞赛
    许多工厂企业和基本建设单位的职工已展开挑战和应战
    【本报讯】中共西安市委员会在九月十二日召集全市工厂企业和基本建设单位的党、行政、工会、青年团负责干部举行会议，布置开展增产节约竞赛。会上，中共西安市委书记方仲如作了报告。
    方仲如在报告中分析了各工厂企业和基本建设单位过去八个月完成计划的情况。为了克服目前工作中的缺点，将企业管理水平提高一步，以保证完成和超额完成今年的国家计划，他要求各级党的组织协同各级行政，动员全体工人、技术人员和职员，开展增产节约竞赛，并做好以下工作：在工厂方面，应建立与健全计划管理工作，编好作业计划。发动群众，围绕作业计划订立小组公约，开展劳动竞赛。与此工作相结合，还应进一步加强科、室工作，健全责任制度。在各基本建设单位，应抓住贯彻施工进度计划这一重要环节，发动群众讨论并围绕施工进度计划订立小组公约，开展竞赛。并在这一基础上发动群众逐步建立行政责任制、施工责任制、技术责任制及供应责任制等，以改善管理。此外，各级党的组织和工会组织必须加强思想政治教育工作，提高群众觉悟，以克服劳动纪律松弛的现象。
    方仲如强调指出：在增产节约竞赛中，必须贯彻全面完成计划的观点，防止只看数量不顾质量和成本的偏向，防止为了表面上完成任务，以产量的超额去弥补质量的不足或以次要产品的超额去弥补主要产品的不足的现象。其次，在竞赛过程中，还必须十分关心工人的生活与安全。方仲如最后号召全市各工厂企业和基本建设单位的职工发挥积极性与创造性，为完成和超额完成今年的国家计划而奋斗。
    六○三工厂的代表张剑英，代表该厂全体职工在会上提出加强计划管理、编好作业计划，为国家增产节约四十亿元的条件，向全市各工厂企业和基本建设单位职工挑战。西安人民面粉厂等单位纷纷提出应战条件，保证完成和超额完成今年的国家计划。
