(Xinhua News Agency, 11th) The national unified college entrance examination was held from August 20th to 23rd. Currently, the grading and scoring work has been completed, and the National College Entrance Examination Committee is conducting admission and assignment work according to the needs of the country.

    This year, a total of 80,758 new students participated in the national unified college entrance examination. Together with the 11,000 outstanding primary school teachers and outstanding graduates of secondary normal schools who were selected and promoted to higher normal schools by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, the total number of candidates applying for national colleges and universities was 91,758. This year's applicants not only meet the country's needs in terms of quantity, but also the quality of the candidates is generally better than last year. Among the candidates who participated in this year's national unified college entrance examination, there were 1,508 graduates from workers' and peasants' quick-track middle schools. This is the first group of worker-peasant intellectuals cultivated by the laboring people under their own regime since liberation to enter colleges and universities for study. In addition, there were 9,536 incumbent cadres who applied. The examination results of candidates nationwide are better than last year, and their health conditions have also greatly improved. After physical examinations, candidates with serious illnesses who are temporarily unsuitable for studying in colleges and universities have been advised to take temporary recuperation. The above situation provides an important guarantee for colleges and universities to enroll qualified new students this year.

    According to preliminary statistics, this year's candidates across the country mostly concentrated their choices on engineering and medical fields. In order to realize national industrialization, it is a very good phenomenon that young students volunteer to study engineering and medicine. However, from the perspective of the country's overall needs, such as the higher vocational courses in colleges and universities that cultivate much-needed senior technicians for national construction, the state's enrollment tasks are very large, but very few students apply; the national construction cause needs a large number of talents in higher normal, geological, mining, and civil engineering fields, but few candidates apply for these departments. In order to take into account the candidates' application wishes as much as possible under the premise of conforming to the needs of the national construction cause, the National College Entrance Examination Committee will consider students' wishes as much as possible if the candidates' examination results are qualified; however, for certain departments and schools that are urgently needed for national construction but have fewer applicants, assignment will have to be guided based on the needs of national construction and the candidates' conditions. This requires candidates to fully understand the needs of the national construction cause, prepare to overcome difficulties, and accept unified national assignment.

    In order to more rationally assign and admit candidates, the National College Entrance Examination Committee held its second meeting on September 5th. In addition to researching and discussing the principles and methods for assigning and admitting new students, it was also decided to require the various local enrollment agencies, educational administrative departments, schools, and local organizations of the Communist Youth League and student federations to closely cooperate in carrying out publicity and education work, explaining to candidates the overall needs of national construction, enabling candidates to establish a correct understanding of all aspects of the national construction cause, and laying a solid ideological foundation for candidates to obey the unified national assignment.

    全国高等学校统一招生考试已经结束
    将按照国家建设的需要分配录取的新生
   【新华社十一日讯】全国高等学校已在八月二十日到二十三日举行统一招生考试。目前阅卷、评分工作已经结束，全国高等学校招生委员会正按照国家需要进行录取分配工作。
    今年参加全国高等学校统一招生考试的新生共有八万零七百五十八人，连同中央人民政府教育部决定抽调升入高等师范学校的优秀小学教师、中等师范学校毕业的优秀学生一万一千人，实际报考全国高等学校的考生共九万一千七百五十八人。今年报考学生，不仅在数量上满足了国家招生的需要，并且考生的质量一般也比去年有所提高。参加今年全国高等学校统一招生考试的考生中有工农速成中学毕业学生一千五百零八人，这是解放以来劳动人民在自己的政权下培养出来的第一批升入高等学校学习的工农知识分子，另有报考的在职干部九千五百三十六人。全国考生考试成绩比去年好，健康情况也有很大进步，经过体格检查后，凡患有严重疾病暂时不宜进入高等学校学习的考生，都劝其暂行疗养。上述情况使今年高等学校要求录取合格新生有了重要保证。
    今年全国考生填报志愿，据初步统计，多集中在工科和医科。为了实现国家工业化，青年学生志愿学工学医，这是很好的现象。但就国家的全面需要来看，如培养国家建设中急需的较高级的技术员的高等学校中的专修科，国家招生任务很大，但报考学生却很少；国家建设事业需要大量的高等师范、工科中的地质、采矿和土木建筑方面的人材，但考生报考这些系科还很少。全国高等学校招生委员会为了在服从国家建设事业需要的前提下尽可能照顾考生的报考志愿，如考生考试成绩合格，将尽可能考虑学生志愿；但为国家建设所迫切需要而报考学生较少的某些系科、学校，将必须根据国家建设需要和考生条件指导分配。这就要求考生充分认识国家建设事业的需要，准备克服困难，接受国家统一分配。
    为了更合理地分配录取考生，全国高等学校招生委员会在九月五日召开了第二次委员会议，除对录取分配新生的原则办法加以研究讨论外，并决定要求各地招生机构、教育行政部门、学校和青年团、学生联合会各地方组织密切配合大力进行宣传教育工作，向考生解释国家建设的全面需要，使考生树立对国家各方面建设事业的正确理解，为考生服从国家统一分配打下稳固的思想基础。
