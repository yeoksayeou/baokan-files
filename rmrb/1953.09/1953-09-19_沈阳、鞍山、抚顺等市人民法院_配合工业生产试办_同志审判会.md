    People's Courts in Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, and other cities
    Cooperate with Industrial Production to Trial "Comrades' Courts"
    This spring, the People's Courts of Shenyang, Anshan, and Fushun each selected a factory to pilot the establishment of "Comrades' Courts." Key pilot experiences have proven that "Comrades' Courts" have played a significant role in strengthening labor discipline, reducing liability accidents, and increasing production enthusiasm.
    Before starting the key pilot work, the People's Courts of Shenyang, Anshan, and other cities organized cadres to study Soviet documents related to "Comrades' Courts" and made full ideological preparations. After being approved by local Party and government leaders, they went deep into the factories to understand the situation and gradually discovered some serious violations of labor discipline and operating procedures. For example, in a workshop in a factory in Fushun, from January to March 1953, 13 people violated operating procedures, and 9 people were absent from work without reason 12 times. Another example is a factory in Shenyang, which found two cases of corruption, five cases of theft, seven cases of assault, and eleven violations of labor discipline and operating procedures in January 1953. Similar situations also existed in Anshan. "Comrades' Court" staff then carried out publicity activities in the key pilot factories. The Party, the trade union, and the administration convened various meetings and used broadcasts and wall newspapers to publicize the nature and tasks of the "Comrades' Court," making everyone realize that the "Comrades' Court" is a mass self-education organization whose main task is to consolidate labor discipline and reduce liability accidents. They also organized discussions within and outside the Party, among cadres and the masses, and won the support and welcome of the workers. With the support of factory leaders, the work of establishing "Comrades' Courts" was smoothly launched. The masses elected the chairman and members of the "Comrades' Court" on a work section (workshop) basis. Its members included activists among the workers, workshop and trade union cadres, etc.
    The "Comrades' Court" adopted a cautious attitude in handling cases, selecting several typical cases for trial to educate the workers. For example, one day a factory in Shenyang had a total of 113 absentees. The day after the "Comrades' Court" meeting, the number was reduced to 86, and there were no more cases of absenteeism without reason. After the establishment of the "Comrades' Court" in a factory in Anshan, the number of fights and violations of operating procedures was greatly reduced; some people who were not at ease with their work also actively produced. Many workers said, "This medicine is really effective, it gets better after taking it!" Through the education of the "Comrades' Court," many workers' enthusiasm for production has been improved. For example, after being educated, Wei Rongxian, a worker in a factory in Anshan, took the initiative to work actively, not only completing his personal production tasks on time, but also promoting the production of the entire class, changing the past situation where tasks could not be completed on time. Workers Zheng Detian and Shen Dequan, after being educated, challenged other groups; worker Pan Baoze, after being educated, worked hard to study production and made creations. Many workers reflected: "'Comrades' Courts' use vivid facts to explain policies and laws to everyone, and educate us so that we don't make mistakes. This method is really good." Some group leaders also said: "This time the plan can be easily handled, and our production will not fall behind." Factory leaders are also very satisfied. When a "Comrades' Court" was held in a factory in Shenyang, more than 300 people from other factories attended and felt that the role of the "Comrades' Court" was very large, and they also requested a trial establishment.
    Editor's note: The "Comrades' Court" is different from the court of the state power organ. It is guided by the trade union of the industrial and mining enterprises where it is located and the local court, and handles cases related to labor and production discipline, minor liability accidents and theft, and disputes among employees in a mass-based sanction and education manner, in order to consolidate labor discipline and increase the labor enthusiasm of employees. The trial establishment of "Comrades' Courts" by the People's Courts of Anshan, Shenyang, and Fushun has played a certain role in consolidating labor discipline, reducing liability accidents, and promoting production; however, this is a new work, and the experience is not yet mature. At present, it can only be piloted in a small number of state-owned enterprises with strong leadership.

    沈阳、鞍山、抚顺等市人民法院
    配合工业生产试办“同志审判会”
    今年春天沈阳、鞍山、抚顺三个市的人民法院，各选择了一个工厂试建“同志审判会”。重点试办的经验证明，“同志审判会”对加强劳动纪律、减少责任事故、提高生产积极性等方面，起了很大作用。
    沈阳、鞍山等三个市人民法院在开始重点试办工作以前，曾组织干部学习了苏联有关“同志审判会”的文件，作了充分的思想准备。经当地党、政领导方面批准后，又深入工厂了解情况，逐步地发现了一些违反劳动纪律和操作规程的严重情况。如抚顺某厂一个车间从一九五三年一月至三月就有十三人违反操作规程，有九人无故旷工十二次。又如沈阳某厂，一九五三年一月份计发现贪污事件两起、盗窃事件五起、殴打事件七起，违反劳动纪律及操作规程的有十一起。鞍山亦有类似情形。“同志审判会”工作人员随后分别在重点试办的工厂中进行宣传活动，由党、工会和行政召集各种会议，利用广播、壁报，宣传了“同志审判会”的性质和任务，使大家认识了“同志审判会”是群众性的自我教育组织，其主要任务是巩固劳动纪律、减少责任事故；并在党内、党外、干部和群众中分别组织了讨论，获得了职工群众的拥护与欢迎。在工厂领导方面的支持下，顺利地展开了建立“同志审判会”的工作。以工段（车间）为单位，由群众选出“同志审判会”的主席和委员。其成员包括工人中的积极分子、车间和工会的干部等。
    “同志审判会”对案件的处理，采取了慎重的态度，选择若干典型案件进行审判，以教育职工群众。如沈阳某厂有一天缺勤人数计一百十三人，“同志审判会”开会后第二天，即减至八十六人，无故旷工的现象没有了。鞍山某工厂在“同志审判会”建立后，打架及违反操作规程的情形，大为减少；某些不安心工作的人也积极生产了。许多工人说：“这副药真灵，吃了就好！”通过“同志审判会”的教育，许多工人的生产积极性提高了。如鞍山某厂工人魏荣咸受到教育后，工作积极主动，不仅能按时完成个人的生产任务，而且推动了全班的生产，改变了过去不能按期完成任务的情况。工人郑德田和申德全，经过教育后，即向其他小组提出挑战；工人潘宝泽被教育后，努力钻研生产，有了创造。许多工人反映：“‘同志审判会’用活生生的事实向大家交代了政策、法令，教育了我们，使我们不犯错误，这个办法真好。”有的小组长也说：“这回计划可好办了，我们生产不会落后了。”工厂领导方面也感到很满意。沈阳有一个厂在一次“同志审判会”开会时，其他工厂有三百多人列席旁听，感到“同志审判会”的作用很大，也要求试建。
    编者按：“同志审判会”不同于国家权力机关的法院。它受所在地工矿企业工会和当地法院的指导，以群众性的制裁和教育感化的方式来处理有关劳动、生产纪律的案件，轻微的责任事故和盗窃案，以及职工群众间的纠纷，借以巩固劳动纪律和提高职工的劳动热忱。鞍山、沈阳、抚顺三市人民法院试建“同志审判会”，对巩固劳动纪律、减少责任事故、推动生产等方面起了一定作用；但这是一项新的工作，经验还不成熟，目前只能在极少数领导较强的国营企业中重点试建。
