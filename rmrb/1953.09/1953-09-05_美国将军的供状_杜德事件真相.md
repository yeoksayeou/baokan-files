    An American General's Confession
    —The Truth About the Dodd Incident
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xiang Ming

    On May 7, 1952, Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Camp 76 on Geoje Island, at the risk of bloodshed, detained U.S. Army Brigadier General Dodd, the camp commander. This incident shocked the world and thoroughly exposed the U.S. side's conspiracy to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

    The Dodd incident was a direct result of the U.S. military's massacres and forced detention of prisoners of war. According to returned Korean People's Army personnel who personally participated in the incident: in the prisoner-of-war camps, the U.S. military authorities consistently used Lee Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek gang special agents to carry out a reign of terror, implement fascist education, force prisoners to tattoo characters on their arms, press blood fingerprints on forged so-called "petitions" refusing repatriation, and illegally carry out "screenings" in an attempt to forcibly detain large numbers of prisoners of war to recruit cannon fodder for the Lee and Chiang gangs. However, the U.S. negotiators at the Panmunjom conference table stubbornly clung to the absurd claim of "voluntary repatriation," using it to deceive the people of the world and conceal the truth about their forced detention of prisoners of war. Under these circumstances, the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were compelled to use the method of detaining Dodd to expose the deception manufactured by the U.S. negotiators and to demand that the U.S. side stop this criminal policy that violated humanitarian principles and international law.

    At 1:30 PM on the 7th, Dodd arrived outside the gate of Camp 76. Under the tight guard of a newly added platoon of armed infantry and two heavy machine guns, only a corner of the gate was opened for him to speak with representatives of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war standing inside the gate. They were about two meters apart. The representatives of the People's Army prisoners of war raised protests to Dodd that had been raised many times before but had yielded no results, listing the U.S. military's atrocities of mistreating and killing prisoners of war, forced "screenings," interruption of food and water supplies, and infringement of the legitimate rights of prisoners of war, demanding that he guarantee that they would not happen again in the future. For nearly two hours, Dodd appeared indifferent to the prisoners' protests, merely whittling at a pencil with a small knife. At 3:15 PM, suddenly, one Korean People's Army prisoner of war grabbed Dodd's hand, another hugged his waist, and two others grabbed his legs, dragging and pulling this fat, noisy American brigadier general into the barbed wire. Then, the gate was closed. At this time, Dodd had completely lost the ability to control himself, trembling all over, his face pale, his legs limp, unable to even speak, like a pile of mud, carried by the prisoners of war from the gate to the inside. Simultaneously captured with Dodd was Lieutenant Colonel Wilbur Raven, commander of the U.S. military police 94th Battalion. He was a bit more agile than Dodd. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, he forcefully broke free from the hands of the person who grabbed him and ran away.

    Within minutes of Dodd's detention, a banner seven meters long and two meters wide written in English was hung at the gate of Camp 76. Gao Guang, a returned Korean People's Army member who had personally drafted this banner, clearly remembers that it read: "We have captured prisoner-of-war camp commander Brigadier General Dodd and absolutely guarantee his safety. After we have completed proper negotiations with him, we will safely repatriate him to you. You will be fully responsible for any adverse consequences caused by serious armed action."

    Dodd was carried into Camp 76, where surgeons among the prisoners of war bandaged the finger that had been cut by the small knife when he was grabbed. A representative of our prisoners of war said to him: "We are true humanitarians, unlike you. Please don't be afraid. We absolutely guarantee your safety." Dodd said: "I hope you release me quickly, otherwise my subordinates will be angry!" The prisoner-of-war representative told him that the time of his release depended on whether he could quickly agree to the prisoners' reasonable demands in the negotiations.

    The Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Camp 76 specially vacated a tent that originally housed one hundred people to serve as Dodd's residence, dividing it into five small rooms with blankets and white cloth: a clean bedroom, a tidy office, and a lounge, etc. Beautiful paper flowers were also placed on the table. In addition, Dodd was asked to notify his subordinates to send him a telephone and a cot. To take care of his life, it was allowed to send him meals on time from the outside, and two unarmed American soldiers were sent to serve him. Except for the last point, because none of the American soldiers dared to enter the tent, the others were all implemented.

    After Dodd was settled, the prisoners-of-war representatives formally told him that representatives from all prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island should be sent here to participate in the negotiations in order to comprehensively resolve the problems of the various prisoner-of-war camps. Dodd immediately ordered the prisoner-of-war camp administration authorities over the telephone to send a jeep and three trucks carrying two prisoner-of-war representatives from Camp 76, led by a U.S. Army captain, to the various prisoner-of-war camps to notify them.

    In the evening, representatives from various prisoner-of-war camps came to Camp 76. The prisoners of war in Camp 76 beat gongs and drums, threw paper flowers at them, and warmly welcomed the representatives in.

    At 9:00 PM that night, the Korean and Chinese prisoners-of-war representatives held an inaugural meeting of the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation (Committee). Forty-three representatives from seventeen prisoner-of-war camps attended the meeting, including four representatives of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war and three female representatives. Some of the prisoners of war from Camp 76 also participated in the meeting. On the front wall of the conference room hung the national flags of Korea and China, and under the flags were colored portraits of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong drawn by the prisoners of war themselves. The surrounding walls were adorned with paper flowers of various colors. Dodd was also called to attend this meeting. After the representatives were seated, he was led into the venue. This executioner, whose hands were stained with blood, seemed particularly polite at that time. He walked to the stage, took off his general's hat with a stiff brim and a white star, first saluted the Korean and Chinese flags and the portraits of the leaders, then saluted all the prisoner-of-war representatives, and then asked the chairman: "Where should I sit?" After the chairman designated a seat for him, he sat down obediently. This inaugural meeting only lasted for more than an hour, electing the head and deputy heads of the delegation. Sun Zhenguan, a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, was elected as the deputy head. After the meeting, an evening party was also held to celebrate the meeting of the Korean and Chinese prisoner-of-war representatives and the capture of Dodd. Dodd himself was also invited to watch the entertainment program.

    The news of Dodd's detention spread like wildfire to the various prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island. This exciting and gratifying news brought them new fighting strength. Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in Camp 602 worked overnight to make slogans and write extra editions. The next morning, a large banner eight meters long and one meter wide made of yellow-green tent cloth was hung at the gate of the barbed wire fence, with the words "Capturing Brigadier General Dodd is an action taken by prisoners of war because they could no longer endure!" written in Chinese and English. In the most conspicuous place in the camp, it was posted in large red letters: "One Brigadier General Dodd Captured!" Thousands of people gathered around the extra edition, thousands of people were cheering and clamoring. One said, "People without guns captured a person with a gun!" Another said, "The murderous executioner has fallen into our hands!" In those days, the various prisoner-of-war camps hung the national flags of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Thousands upon thousands of prisoners of war lined up in front of the barbed wire, playing joyous songs with homemade instruments, singing, and shouting slogans, expressing their support for their negotiating representatives, their insistence on the right of prisoner-of-war repatriation, and their struggle for humane treatment. At that time, the U.S. military officers and soldiers became "docile," and even Lieutenant Colonel Raven saluted the Korean and Chinese prisoner-of-war representatives flatteringly.

    From the 8th, the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation formally began negotiations with Dodd. The form of negotiation was mainly through exchange of documents, often requiring several exchanges of documents for one issue. On the 8th, the U.S. military authorities announced that Colonel Colson would replace Dodd's position, so the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation had to negotiate with both Dodd in the prisoner-of-war camp and Colson outside the prisoner-of-war camp at the same time. Colson's office was set up in a small tent outside the gate of Camp 76. He and Dodd exchanged opinions through telephone. Every day, they would have Dodd give an oral answer to all the Korean and Chinese prisoners-of-war representatives on the results of their discussions. If everyone had any opinions, they would raise them to Dodd and Colson, and they would study them and give a new answer. On the 9th, U.S. Eighth Army Commander Van Fleet even personally came to Geoje Island to give instructions to Colson and spoke with Dodd in the prisoner-of-war camp by telephone.

    The tables in the office tent of the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation were filled with textual and pictorial materials secretly collected by representatives from various prisoner-of-war camps on the U.S. military's mistreatment and killing of prisoners of war, including the major events of the U.S. military's massacre of prisoners of war that they had compiled themselves, the U.S. military's Far East Command's newspaper - Stars and Stripes, South Korea's "Democratic News," "Pusan Daily," and fragmented materials published in American newspapers and periodicals. Dodd came here every day to answer questions, and when he saw these incriminating evidences, he appeared restless and very embarrassed.

    The main content of the negotiations was the four demands put forward by the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, including demanding that the U.S. military authorities immediately stop all atrocities against prisoners of war, stop the so-called "voluntary repatriation" used to illegally detain prisoners of war, stop forced "screenings," and recognize the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation. In the face of truth and justice, Dodd and Colson had to accept most of the prisoners' demands. They admitted that there had been bloodshed in the prisoner-of-war camp, resulting in the death and injury of many prisoners of war, and they guaranteed to do everything possible to prevent such incidents from happening again. They agreed not to conduct forced "screenings" of prisoners of war in the future. They promised to recognize the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation and guarantee that its activities would not be restricted. In addition, the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation raised the issue of communicating with their families, and Dodd and Colson also agreed, and received many letters to family members from the prisoners of war in Camp 76 and letters of gratitude to Premier Kim Il-sung.

    The content of the above four demands was typed into a formal document by the U.S. military prisoner-of-war camp administration authorities, personally signed by Colson and Dodd, and delivered to the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation on the evening of the 10th.

    Clark, who was embarrassed by Colson and Dodd's confessions and promises, awkwardly concealed it by saying that Colson's promises were "made under extreme duress." But the fact is: it was the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were coerced, not this prisoner-of-war camp commander who possessed numerous armed forces.

    On the morning of the 8th, the day after Dodd was detained, the U.S. military drove up twenty-two tanks and patrolled back and forth around the barbed wire fence of Camp 76. About a regiment of infantry dug fortifications around the camp, and artillery was set up on the hills on both sides. At 9:00 AM on the 9th, Colson, as soon as he took office, threatened the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war through the broadcasting system: "I will give you ten minutes to release Dodd, otherwise, I will use force to rescue him." The Korean prisoners of war told Dodd: "If Colson uses force to disrupt the peaceful negotiations we are conducting, we will not be able to guarantee your safety." Dodd then notified Colson not to use force. Early on the 10th, U.S. military tanks surrounded Camp 76 again and posed as if they were about to rush in. After Dodd found out, he panicked and called Colson to "quickly withdraw the armed soldiers and tanks." On this day, Colson issued five ultimatums, each time deploying tanks to surround Camp 76. However, the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were very calm. As long as they said to Dodd "They're here again," he would immediately panic, grab the headset, and talk to Colson. If the person on the other end of the phone was a colonel, he would shout loudly, "I don't want the colonel, I want to talk to the general." Then, he would say to Colson: "Don't use force to come in, I am very safe here."

    9:45 PM on the 10th was the time for the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation to release Dodd. Before Dodd was released, according to the notification of the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation, Colson sent Lieutenant Colonel Raven and another person, holding a receipt, unarmed, waiting to pick up Dodd at the gate. Dodd's car, marked with a white star, was parked next to them. According to the request of the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation, the surrounding tanks were rumbling backward. The Korean and Chinese prisoners of war would never allow Dodd to be released under the pressure of force.

    At 9:35 PM, the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation led Dodd into the office. A representative asked him: "You have lived here for a few days, do you have any opinions?" Dodd handed this representative a pre-written note. The main idea was: I have received the highest humanitarian treatment here. In the very difficult prisoner-of-war camp environment, my life has not been affected in any way. In our negotiations, you have guaranteed my freedom of speech and action. In the future, I will definitely do my best to abide by the agreement and strive to realize this agreement. I thank all the Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Camp 76 and wish you good health.

    At 9:45 PM, Lieutenant Colonel Raven handed over the receipt written in both Korean and English. It read: "To the representatives of the Korean and Chinese Prisoner-of-War Delegation: I, Wilbur Raven, Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army, Commander of the U.S. Military Police 94th Battalion, under the order of General Colson, at 9:45 PM on May 10, 1952, at the main gate of Camp 76, receive from two Korean and Chinese prisoner-of-war representatives Brigadier General Dodd, prisoner-of-war camp commander, who was detained by the prisoners of war of Camp 76 at 3:15 PM on May 7, 1952. Wilbur Raven (signature)" Dodd, who had been detained by the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war for seventy-eight hours and thirty minutes, waved his hat goodbye to the prisoner-of-war representatives when he was about to leave the gate.

    However, as soon as Dodd left the barbed wire fence, the U.S. military authorities tore up all their promises in front of the people of the world and carried out a frantic and cruel massacre of the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, beginning the "Bonner Terror Period." The Korean and Chinese prisoner-of-war representatives who participated in that negotiation were also secretly imprisoned by the U.S. military authorities and have not been repatriated to this day. The Korean and Chinese people have the right to demand that the U.S. military authorities immediately release and repatriate the Korean and Chinese prisoner-of-war representatives, and immediately repatriate all the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who insist on repatriation in accordance with the armistice agreement.

    美国将军的供状
    ——杜德事件真相
    新华社记者  向明
    一九五二年五月七日，巨济岛第七十六号战俘营的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，冒着流血的危险，扣留了美军战俘营长官杜德准将。这件事情曾经轰动了全世界，使美方强迫扣留朝中战俘的阴谋彻底暴露出来。
    杜德事件，是美军大批屠杀和强迫扣留战俘的直接后果。据亲身参与这一事件的朝鲜人民军归来人员说：在战俘营里，美军当局一贯利用李、蒋匪帮特务分子进行恐怖统治，施行法西斯教育，强迫战俘在臂上刺字、在伪造的所谓拒绝遣返的“请愿书”上按血印，非法进行“甄别”，企图大批扣留战俘为李、蒋匪帮搜罗炮灰。而美国的谈判代表却在板门店会议桌上，一口咬住“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，并以此欺骗世界人民，掩饰其强迫扣留战俘的真相。朝中被俘人员在这种情况下，迫不得已才用扣留杜德的方法来戳穿美国谈判代表所制造的骗局，并要求美方停止这种违反人道原则、违反国际公法的罪恶政策。
    七日下午一时三十分，杜德来到第七十六号战俘营的大门外，在临时增加的一个武装步兵排和两挺重机枪的严密警戒下，只开了一角大门，和站在门里的朝鲜人民军被俘人员代表谈话。他们中间相距约二公尺。人民军被俘人员代表向杜德提出以前提过多次、但未获得任何结果的抗议，列举美军虐杀战俘、强迫“甄别”、中断食粮和饮水供给以及侵犯战俘合法权利等暴行，要求他保证今后不再发生。谈了将近两个钟头，杜德对于被俘人员的抗议显然毫不在意，只是漫不经心地拿着小刀在削铅笔。三时十五分，突然，由一个朝鲜人民军被俘人员抓住杜德的手，另一个人抱住腰，两个人抱住腿，把这个肥头大耳、哇哇乱叫的美国准将，连拖带拉地弄进了铁丝网，然后，把大门关起来。这时，杜德已完全失去了控制自己的能力，全身发抖，脸色惨白，两腿瘫软，连话都不会说，好像是一堆泥，由被俘人员从大门口一直抬到里边。和杜德同时被抓的，还有美军宪兵第九十四大队的大队长威尔伯·莱汶中校，他比杜德要机伶一点，看到形势不妙，便用力从抓他的人手中挣脱跑掉了。
    杜德被扣以后几分钟，第七十六号战俘营的门口，就挂出了一幅七公尺长、两公尺宽用英文写的标语。曾经亲自草拟这个标语的朝鲜人民军归来人员高光，还清楚地记得上面写着：“我们生俘了战俘营长官杜德准将，绝对保证他的生命安全。待我们和他进行正当的谈判完毕之后，就安全地遣返给你们。如因严重的武装行动而造成的不良后果，将由你们负完全责任。”
    杜德被抬进了第七十六号战俘营，由被俘人员中的外科医生，给他包扎好在他被抓进来的时候被削铅笔的小刀划破了的手指。我方被俘人员代表对他说：“我们是真正的人道主义者，不像你们那样，请你不要害怕，我们绝对保证你的生命安全。”杜德说：“希望你们赶快放了我，否则我的部下就要发怒了！”被俘人员代表就告诉他：释放他的时间决定于他本人是否能在谈判中很快答应战俘们的合理要求。
    第七十六号战俘营的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，特地把原来住一百个人的一个帐篷腾出来，给杜德作住所，用毯子和白布隔成五间小屋：有洁净的卧室，整齐的办公室和休息室等，桌上还摆了漂亮的纸花。此外，并要杜德通知他的部下给他送进来一个电话机、一只行军床。为了照顾他的生活，允许外边按时给他送饭，同时派两个不带武器的美国兵来服侍他。除了最后一点由于美国兵中没有一个人敢进帐篷来以外，其他的都实现了。
    杜德被安置好以后，被俘人员代表正式告诉他，要巨济岛各战俘营都派代表来这里参加谈判，以便通盘解决各战俘营的问题。杜德马上从电话上命令战俘营管理当局，开来一辆吉普车和三辆卡车，载着七十六号战俘营的两个被俘人员代表，由一个美军上尉带领，到各战俘营去通知。
    晚上，各战俘营的代表都到七十六号战俘营来了。七十六号战俘营的被俘人员敲锣打鼓，向他们抛纸花，热情地把代表们欢迎进来。
    当晚九时，朝中被俘人员代表举行朝中战俘代表团（委员会）成立大会，到会的有十七个战俘营的四十三个代表，其中有志愿军被俘人员代表四人，女代表三人。第七十六号战俘营的一部分被俘人员也参加了这个会议。会议室正面墙上挂着朝、中两国的国旗，旗子底下是由被俘人员自己画的金日成首相和毛泽东主席的彩色像，墙的四周都缀满了各色纸花。在这个大会上，杜德也被叫来参加。当代表们入坐以后，他被引进了会场。这个双手沾满鲜血的刽子手，那时显得特别有礼貌。他走到台上，脱下了帽沿笔挺的、嵌有白星的将军帽，先向朝、中国旗和领袖像敬礼，又向全体战俘代表敬礼，然后问主席：“我应该坐在什么地方？”主席给他指定座位后，他就规规矩矩地坐下来。这个成立大会只开了一个多小时，选出正副团长，志愿军被俘人员代表孙振冠被选为副团长。会后，还举行了庆祝朝中战俘代表会合与俘获杜德的晚会，杜德本人也被请去看游艺节目。
    杜德被扣的消息，像一阵风似的传到巨济岛上的各战俘营。这个令人振奋的、大快人心的消息，给他们带来了新的斗争力量。第六零二战俘营里的志愿军被俘人员连夜赶制标语、编写号外。第二天早晨，铁丝网的大门口就挂出了一幅八公尺长、一公尺宽，黄绿色帐篷布制成的大标语，上面用中文和英文写着：“俘掳杜德准将是战俘们出于忍无可忍的行动！”营场里最醒目的地方，贴出了红笔大字书写的：“俘掳杜德准将一名！”几千人都围在号外的跟前，几千人在欢呼、喧嚷。这个说：“没有枪的人抓了一个有枪的人！”那个说：“杀人的刽子手落到我们手里了！”这几天，各战俘营都悬挂起中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗，成千上万的被俘人员排队站在铁丝网跟前，用自制的乐器奏着欢乐的歌曲，唱歌、喊口号，表示支援自己的谈判代表、坚持战俘遣返权利和争取人道待遇的斗争。那时，美军官兵都变得“驯善”起来，甚至莱汶中校见到朝中战俘代表，都谄媚地敬礼。
    从八日起，朝中战俘代表团和杜德正式开始谈判。谈判的形式主要是文件往来，常常因为一个问题要来往几次文件。八日，美军当局宣布以柯尔生代替杜德的职务，朝中战俘代表团就要同时和战俘营里的杜德与战俘营外的柯尔生两个人谈判。柯尔生的办公室就设在第七十六号战俘营门外的一个小帐篷里。他和杜德通过电话来交换意见，每天，把他们商量的结果，由杜德向全体朝中战俘代表作口头答复，如果大家有意见，再向杜德与柯尔生提出，由他们研究后重新答复。九日，美军第八军军长范佛里特还亲自到巨济岛来向柯尔生面授机宜，并与战俘营里的杜德通过电话。
    朝中战俘代表团在自己办公帐篷的桌子上，摆满了各战俘营代表带来的、秘密搜集好的美军虐杀战俘的文字和图片材料，包括他们自己编写的美军屠杀战俘大事记，美军远东司令部的机关报——星条报、南朝鲜的“民主新闻”、“釜山日报”以及美国报刊上登载的片断材料。杜德每天到这里来解答问题，当他看到这些罪证时，显出坐立不安、十分窘迫的样子。
    谈判的主要内容是朝中被俘人员所提出的四项要求，其中包括要求美军当局立即停止对战俘的一切暴行、停止借以非法扣留战俘的所谓“自愿遣返”、停止强迫“甄别”、承认朝中战俘代表团。在真理和正义的面前，杜德和柯尔生不得不接受战俘们的大部分要求。他们承认战俘营内有过流血事件发生、结果有许多战俘被打死打伤，他们保证尽一切力量使这类事件不再发生；他们同意此后不再对战俘进行强迫“甄别”；他们答应承认朝中战俘代表团、保证其活动不受限制。此外，朝中战俘代表团提出要和他们的家属通信的问题，杜德和柯尔生也答应了，并接收了第七十六号战俘营被俘人员的许多封家信和给金日成首相的感激信。
    上述四项要求的内容，由美军战俘营管理当局用打字机打成正式文件，并由柯尔生和杜德亲自签署后于十日晚送交朝中战俘代表团。
    被柯尔生和杜德的供状和诺言弄得狼狈不堪的克拉克，曾尴尬地掩饰说，柯尔生的诺言是“在极大的威胁之下作出的”。但事实是：受到胁迫的是朝中被俘人员，并不是这位拥有众多武装力量的战俘营长官。
    八日晨，杜德被扣的第二天，美军就开来二十二辆坦克，围着第七十六号战俘营的铁丝网来回巡逻，大约一个团的步兵在营场四周挖工事，在两边的山头上架起了炮。九日上午九时，柯尔生一上台，就通过广播器威胁朝中战俘：“限你们十分钟以内释放杜德，否则，我将用武力来营救他。”朝鲜被俘人员告诉杜德说：“如果柯尔生用武力来破坏我们之间所进行的和平谈判，我们将无法来保证你的生命安全。”杜德便通知柯尔生不要使用武力。十日一早，美军坦克又包围了七十六号战俘营，并且摆出向里冲的架势，杜德知道以后，十分惊慌地打电话叫柯尔生“赶快把武装兵和坦克撤退”。在这一天，柯尔生发出过五次最后通牒，每次都出动坦克把七十六号战俘营包围起来。但是，朝中被俘人员却十分镇静，只要向杜德说一句“又来了”，他马上就张慌失措，抓起耳机找柯尔生讲话。假若碰到对方是上校接电话，他就厉声嚷道：“我不要上校，我要找将军讲话。”然后，就对柯尔生说：“千万不要用武力进来，我在这里很安全。”
    十日下午九点四十五分是朝中战俘代表团释放杜德的时间。杜德释放前，按照朝中战俘代表团的通知，柯尔生就派了莱汶中校和另一个人，拿着接收证，不带武器，在大门口等着接杜德。旁边停着标有一颗白星的杜德的轿车。按照朝中战俘代表团的要求，四周的坦克正在轰隆轰隆地向后撤退，朝中被俘人员决不允许在武力的压迫下释放杜德。
    九点三十五分，朝中战俘代表团把杜德引进办公室，一个代表问他：“你在我们这里生活了几天，有什么意见？”杜德把事先写好的一个纸条交给这位代表。上面写着，大意是：我在你们这里受到了最高的人道主义待遇。在非常困难的战俘营环境下，我的生活并未受到任何影响。在我们的谈判中，你们保证了我在言论上和行动上的自由。今后，我一定尽自己的力量遵守协议，并为实现这个协议而努力。我感谢第七十六号战俘营的全体朝鲜人民军战俘，祝你们身体健康。
    九点四十五分，莱汶中校交来了用朝英两种文字写的接收证。上面写着：“朝中战俘代表团诸位代表：美军第九十四宪兵大队大队长、美国陆军中校威尔伯·莱汶，奉柯尔生将军之命，于一九五二年五月十日下午九时四十五分，在第七十六号战俘营正门，从两位朝中战俘代表处，接收到一九五二年五月七日下午三点十五分被第七十六号战俘营战俘所拘禁的战俘营长官杜德准将。威尔伯·莱汶（签字）”被朝中被俘人员扣押了七十八个小时又三十分钟的杜德，在临出大门时，还向战俘代表挥帽告别。
    但是，杜德一出铁丝网，美军当局就在全世界人民面前撕毁了它的一切诺言，对朝中战俘进行了疯狂而残酷的屠杀，开始了“波纳恐怖时期”。而参加过那次谈判的朝中战俘代表，也都被美军当局秘密监禁起来，至今未被遣返。朝中人民有权要求美军当局立即释放并遣返朝中战俘代表，并立即按照停战协定遣返全部坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员。
