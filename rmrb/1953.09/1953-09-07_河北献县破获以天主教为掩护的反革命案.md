The Cangxian Prefectural Public Security Bureau of Hebei Province, with the strong cooperation of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau, after a long and thorough investigation, recently cracked a case of imperialist elements using Catholicism to carry out counter-revolutionary secret sabotage activities in Xian County and other places in Cangxian Prefecture, Hebei Province. The principal offenders, Zhang Siqian (from Xian County, acting bishop of the Xian County Catholic Diocese, president of the Society of Jesus), Jia Shushan (from Renqiu County, chief priest of the Xian County General Church), and accomplices Wang Junde, Lan Luyi, Wang Dewang, and others, a total of eight people, have all been arrested.

The counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Siqian and Jia Shushan, etc., are all loyal pawns of imperialism disguised in religious garb, using the titles of "President of the Society of Jesus" and "Catholic Priest" as a front. The principal offender, Zhang Siqian, also known as Zhang Yuting, went to Paris via Beijing in 1948, when North China was about to be completely liberated, for specialized "training" in Rome. In April 1950, he was sent back to Shanghai and then sent to Tianjin by Pu Mindao, an imperialist element of the Chinese Society of Jesus in Shanghai. After that, he immediately used his position as acting bishop of the Xian County Catholic Diocese and president of the Society of Jesus as a cover to carry out counter-revolutionary secret sabotage activities. At the same time, Zhang quickly colluded with Jia Shushan, one of the counter-revolutionary criminals in the "Xian County International Espionage Case." Jia was sentenced to imprisonment by our judicial organs in the "Xian County International Espionage Case" for inciting the People's Liberation Army and young people to flee, and for providing information to the imperialists; after being leniently released, he not only did not repent but actively developed the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary," and recruited some landlords and members of the Home Returning Corps (还乡团) into his organization to continue carrying out anti-people conspiracies and sabotage activities. In order to facilitate sabotage, Zhang used his power as acting bishop to force Catholic priests and monks in Xian County to engage in illegal secret activities, and established a number of secret organizations in the name of "evangelization"; and in the name of "secret evangelization," he deceived the Catholic masses, controlled some of the Catholic clergy in the Xian County Diocese, and, according to the instructions of the imperialist element Pu Mindao lurking in Shanghai, worked with Jia to carry out counter-revolutionary secret sabotage activities in the Xian County Diocese, Tianjin and other places. Zhang and Jia had tried in every possible way to gather confidential information about our People's Government, especially our People's Public Security organs. In order to send the collected intelligence to the imperialist elements in the Shanghai Catholic Church, Zhang established intelligence stations in the Xian County Diocese in the name of "secret evangelization," and also set up a secret liaison station in Tianjin, which was responsible for contacting the imperialist element Pu Mindao in Shanghai by Wang Junde (president of the Tianjin Jesuit Society). They also spread reactionary remarks everywhere, blatantly calling on Catholics to "die for the Lord" and "unite to resist," plotting to incite riots. In order to achieve the above goals, they also secretly set up mimeograph machines and typewriters in Renqiu County, Jiaohe County, and other places to print various reactionary propaganda materials, and a reactionary priest named Lan Luyi, who was transferred from Shanghai to Tianjin, was specifically responsible for writing reactionary propaganda materials. When U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower came to power, Zhang Siqian and others openly boasted about the U.S. military might and spread fear, admiration, and flattery of the United States. In addition to instilling reactionary ideas into Catholics, they threatened clergy and the general public with "removing divine power" and "stopping divine deeds" to prevent them from participating in the anti-imperialist and patriotic movement; and they organized landlords to counter-attack and settle accounts with peasants, threatening the emancipated peasant Catholics to kneel down and beg the landlords for mercy. Even more viciously, they used deceptive and lucrative means to send the minions they had fostered into our village political power organizations to carry out sabotage activities such as gathering intelligence, spreading rumors, and disintegrating militia organizations, and also instigated their minions to rob our cadres of their guns and plot to carry out assassinations.

The counter-revolutionary secret sabotage activities of the principal offenders Zhang Siqian and Jia Shushan were actively supported and encouraged by imperialist elements. Imperialist elements often sent large sums of money from abroad in the name of the "Church" as funds for their counter-revolutionary activities; and instructed Zhang Siqian and other criminals on how to actively carry out conspiracies and sabotage activities. Among the documents seized, in a letter personally written to Zhang Siqian by imperialist element J.B. Janssens from Rome on March 12 this year, it was mentioned: "The report you made last year about you... has reached my hands, and I received this information with great pleasure..." Janssens also encouraged Zhang and others in the letter, saying: "Bless you, so that you can get help and be able to persevere in your own heroic cause."

Zhang Siqian and other criminals engaged in counter-revolutionary activities in an extremely secretive manner. The names they usually used were all "aliases." Zhang Siqian used the aliases Zhou Zhen and Zhou Muzhen, while Jia Shushan used the alias Ji Shan; and many place names and personal names were encoded into secret codes for secret contact. They also dug many cellars, under-the-kang cellars, partition walls, and secret rooms in the Xian County Catholic Diocese. In one household in a village in Jiaohe alone, there were as many as seven such facilities. Zhang Siqian and Jia Shushan attempted to use these cellars and secret rooms as their bases for carrying out counter-revolutionary conspiracies for a long time.

In this case cracked by our People's Public Security organs, in addition to arresting Zhang Siqian, Jia Shushan, and other criminals, 83 reactionary documents and reactionary books, mimeograph machines, typewriters, and other evidence of crimes such as contact codes and secret lists were seized. Now our People's Public Security organs are conducting a thorough interrogation of the criminals.

Imperialist spies and counter-revolutionary elements have a long history of engaging in counter-revolutionary conspiracies within the Xian County Catholic Church. In 1947, we cracked an international espionage case headed by Shang Jianxun. This time, we cracked a counter-revolutionary secret sabotage activity case headed by Zhang Siqian and Jia Shushan. This is another major victory in the anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle of the Chinese people and patriotic Catholics. This also fully shows that imperialism and its running dogs are painstakingly unwilling to accept the great victory of our people. Therefore, all the people and patriotic Catholics must continue to be vigilant and be prepared at any time to severely and painfully strike at the conspiracies of imperialist elements and counter-revolutionary elements who use the church to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, in order to protect the people's freedom of religious belief and religious activities.

    河北献县破获以天主教为掩护的反革命案
    河北省沧县专署公安处，在天津市人民政府公安局大力配合下，经过长期周密的侦察以后，于日前在沧县专区献县等地破获了帝国主义分子利用天主教进行反革命秘密破坏活动案。主犯张思谦（献县人，献县天主教区代理主教，耶稣会会长）、贾书善（任邱县人，献县总本堂神甫）和从犯王峻德、蓝路一、王德望等八人均已就捕。
    反革命分子张思谦和贾书善等都是披着宗教外衣，以“耶稣会会长”、“天主教神甫”为招牌的帝国主义的忠实爪牙。主犯张思谦又名张玉亭，于一九四八年华北即将全部解放时，由北京去巴黎转罗马受专门“训练”，一九五零年四月被派回上海，继由上海中华耶稣会的帝国主义分子蒲敏道将其派到天津。之后，他即以献县天主教区代理主教和耶稣会长的职务作掩护，进行反革命秘密破坏活动。同时张犯很快就和“献县国际间谍案”的反革命罪犯之一贾书善相勾结。贾犯曾在“献县国际间谍案”中因煽惑解放军及青壮年逃亡，供给帝国主义情报，被我司法机关判处徒刑；经宽大释放后，不仅不知悔改，反而积极发展反动组织“圣母军”，并将一些被斗地主及还乡团分子网罗在其组织中，继续进行反人民的阴谋破坏活动。为了便于进行破坏，张即利用代理主教的权力，逼使献县天主教神甫、修士等转入非法秘密活动，以“传教”为名成立了若干秘密组织；并以“秘密传教”为名，欺骗教徒群众，把献县教区的一部分天主教神职人员控制在手里，根据潜藏在上海的帝国主义分子蒲敏道的指示，与贾犯潜伏在献县教区、天津市等地，进行反革命秘密破坏活动。张、贾两犯曾经多方刺探我人民政府特别是我人民公安机关的机密情况。张犯为了把搜集的情报送交上海天主教内的帝国主义分子，在献县教区内，以“秘密传教”为名，设立情报站，并且在天津市专设了一个秘密联络站，由王峻德（耶稣会天津会院院长）负责和上海帝国主义分子蒲敏道联络。他们还到处散布反动言论，明目张胆地号召教徒“为主致命”，“联合起来反抗”，阴谋策动暴乱。为达到以上目的，他们还在任邱县、交河县等地秘密设置了油印机、打字机，印刷各种反动宣传品，并由从上海调到天津的一个叫蓝路一的反动神甫，专管编写反动宣传品。当美国总统艾森豪威尔登台时，张思谦等竟公然大肆吹嘘美国军事威力，散布恐美、崇美、媚美思想。他们除向教徒灌输反动思想外，并以“摘神权”、“停止神功”等威胁神职人员和广大教徒，阻止他们参加反帝爱国运动；并组织地主向农民反攻倒算，威胁翻身农民教徒，向地主跪祷求情。更恶毒的是他们竟用欺骗利诱手段，把豢养的爪牙派进我村政权组织内，进行刺探情报、散布谣言、瓦解民兵组织等破坏活动，并主使其爪牙劫夺我干部的枪支，阴谋进行暗害活动。
    主犯张思谦、贾书善的这些反革命秘密破坏活动，是得到帝国主义分子的积极支持和鼓励的。帝国主义分子经常以“教会”名义，从国外寄来大批金钱作为他们进行反革命活动的经费；并指示张思谦等犯积极进行阴谋破坏活动的办法。在查获的证件中有：今年三月十二日罗马方面的帝国主义分子杨森斯（J．B．Janssens）亲自写给张思谦的信中曾说到：“你去年所作的关于你们……报告，已到了我的手里，我以极大的高兴，收到了这些情报……。”杨森斯并在信中鼓励张犯等说：“祝福你们，以便你们能得到帮助，并能坚持你们自己的英雄事业。”
    张思谦等犯，从事反革命活动极为诡密。他们平日所用的名字都是“化名”。张思谦曾化名周真、周慕真，贾书善则化名绩善；并把很多地名、人名编成暗号，秘密联系。他们还在献县天主教区内挖有地洞、炕下洞、夹壁墙和暗室多处，仅在交河某村一户中，就有这样的设备七处之多。张思谦、贾书善就企图依据这些地洞、暗室，作为其长期进行反革命阴谋活动的阵地。
    我人民政府公安机关此次破案，除逮捕张思谦、贾书善等犯外，并查获各种反动文件、反动书籍八十三件，油印机、打字机以及联络暗号、秘密名单等罪证多种。现在我人民公安机关正对案犯进行严密审讯中。
    帝国主义间谍、反革命分子在献县天主教会内从事反革命阴谋活动是有长期历史的，一九四七年曾被我破获了以尚建勋为首的国际间谍案一起，此次又破获了以张思谦、贾书善为首的反革命秘密破坏活动案。这是我国人民与爱国教徒反帝爱国斗争的又一重大胜利。这也充分说明帝国主义及其走狗对于我国人民的伟大胜利是处心积虑死不甘心的。因此全体人民和爱国教徒必须继续提高警惕，随时准备对帝国主义分子、反革命分子利用教会进行反革命破坏活动的阴谋给以严厉的痛击，以保护人民宗教信仰和宗教活动的自由。
