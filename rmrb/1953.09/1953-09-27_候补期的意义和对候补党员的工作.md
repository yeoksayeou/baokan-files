    The Meaning of the Probationary Period and Work with Probationary Party Members
    Soviet Union, Si. Kuerjin
    Editor's Note: This article is the editorial department of the Soviet "Communist" magazine's reply to questions raised by many readers. Readers wrote to "Communist" asking to clarify the meaning of the probationary period and how party organizations conduct work with probationary party members. This is also a matter of concern for many readers in our country. Therefore, we have translated and published this article here.

    The issue of Party membership is a fundamental issue in Party building. The Communist Party constantly concerns itself with the purity of its ranks, improving its members, and enhancing the title of Party member. As everyone knows, the solidarity, discipline, and consciousness of the Party, and ultimately the fate of the Party's resolutions, are largely determined by the Party's members.

    The strength of the Communist Party lies not only in the number of its members but primarily in their quality. Faced with the new tasks of massive communist construction, the Party demands a higher sense of responsibility from every Party member for the cause of the Party. Comrade Malenkov, in his summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, pointed out that it is necessary to continue to improve the quality of the Party, to avoid pursuing quantity, but to concentrate efforts on raising the political level and Marxist cultivation of Party members and probationary Party members, and to enhance the political activity of Communist Party members, so that all Party members become staunch fighters for the realization of the Party's policies and resolutions.

    The clear requirements for Party members expressed in the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted at the 19th Party Congress fully correspond to the Party's tasks at the current stage. Implementing the provisions of the Party Constitution will further consolidate Party discipline, strengthen the initiative and enthusiasm of Communist Party members, and enhance their vanguard role in communist construction.

    The supplementary provisions regarding probationary Party members introduced to the Party Constitution at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union embody the Party's concern for the purity and quality of its ranks. The adoption of these supplementary provisions is to improve the work of Party organizations with probationary Party members and to strengthen the probationary Party members' own sense of responsibility during the probationary period.

    Why must everyone joining the ranks of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union undergo a probationary period? What is the meaning of this probationary period?

    The Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union states that the probationary period is necessary to enable probationary Party members to familiarize themselves with the Party Program, the Party Constitution, and the Party's strategy, and to enable Party organizations to assess the personal qualities of probationary Party members.

    Article 3 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union specifies in detail the obligations of Party members at the present stage of communist construction. Party members should strive to safeguard the unity of the Party, as it is the main condition for the Party's strength and power; Party members must be active fighters for the implementation of the Party's resolutions; set an example in labor, and strive to protect and consolidate socialist public ownership; strengthen ties with the masses daily; grasp the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism; abide by Party and state discipline, conduct self-criticism and criticism from below; report shortcomings in work to the Party's leading organs up to the Central Committee of the Party, regardless of who is involved; be loyal and honest to the Party; keep Party and state secrets; resolutely implement the Party's instructions on the correct selection of cadres.

    Obviously, everyone joining the Communist Party of the Soviet Union should have the determination to correctly implement all the Party's instructions and fulfill the obligations of a Communist Party member. The probationary period has significant importance in educating Communist Party members. During the probationary period, the Party must examine each probationary Party member's loyalty to the cause of communism, their political awareness and discipline, and their qualities.

    The Central Committee of the Party, Lenin, and Stalin have repeatedly pointed out the significance of the probationary period and the ideological education work of probationary Party members. V.I. Lenin demanded the adoption of strict rules to ensure that the probationary period truly becomes a serious test, rather than an empty formality.

    The Party regards the work of admitting new Party members, the work of probationary Party members, and their education as inseparable tasks. This has been mentioned more than once in many Party documents—resolutions of congresses, conferences, and the Central Committee. For example, the decision of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) adopted in December 1935 on the summary report on the work of checking Party membership cards pointed out: "The plenary session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) resolutely condemns the fact that occurs in many Party organizations: when new Party members or probationary Party members are admitted, they are forgotten, and no concern is shown for these new, immature members who have not understood all the traditions of Bolshevik organization." Later, in 1938, the Central Committee, in its resolution "On the Procedure for Admitting New Members to the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," instructed Party organizations to treat the work of dealing with new Party members as the most important task, to educate new Party members in the spirit of Bolshevik Party character, and to absorb them into Party work and social work. In several subsequent resolutions, the Central Committee also made similar instructions to Party organizations.

    From this, it can be seen how much importance the Communist Party attaches to the education of its new recruits and how significant the probationary period is.

    How do Party organizations work with probationary Party members?

    The probationary period should become a school for Party education and training. That is to say, Marxist-Leninist study for probationary Party members should be well arranged, they should be actively involved in Party life, and the personal qualities of each probationary Party member should be examined to see if they can become a Party member.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has specifically explained in several resolutions how to arrange the education work of new Party members. For example, in the resolution on the work of admitting new Party members to the Party by the Gorky Oblast Committee adopted in August 1951, the Central Committee suggested that the Oblast Committee increase the responsibility of grassroots organizations, district committees, and municipal committees for cultivating probationary Party members into Party members, so that the probationary period is truly used to educate and examine the personal qualities of probationary Party members and to familiarize probationary Party members with the Party Program, the Party Constitution, and the Party's strategy. The Central Committee tasked the Party's grassroots organizations, district committees, and municipal committees with actively involving probationary Party members in social life and Party life, caring for them so that they can all complete the Party's assignments, attend Party meetings, strictly abide by Party and state discipline, and improve their ideological and political level and professional level.

    One of the most important tasks of Party organizations is to arm new Party members ideologically, to care for them so that they can understand the Party's policies and understand the essence of the requirements that the Party makes of its members. According to the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, every Communist Party member should "strive to raise their awareness and grasp the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism." It is the responsibility of Party organizations to help Communist Party members fulfill this obligation to study Marxism-Leninism. Raising the political level of Party members and probationary Party members is a necessary condition for strengthening their vanguard role in all areas of life and for making the Party masses more active and improving the work of Party organizations.

    However, facts show that some Party organizations are preoccupied with affairs and have forgotten ideological work, and still pay little attention to the ideological and political education of Party members, and propaganda work is still poorly organized. Probationary Party members need more help in studying Marxist-Leninist theory, but some Party organization secretaries handle this work very simply, believing that as long as probationary Party members are enrolled in groups or schools, everything will be fine. This formalistic attitude towards work will prevent many probationary Party members from studying well. Party organization secretaries should understand the learning situation of each probationary Party member in political schools or groups; they should consider and meet the requirements of probationary Party members; and they should care about probationary Party members' study of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. To this end, the Party organization committee or secretary should set up special courses for probationary Party members and organize lectures on the Party Constitution for them. The leaders and lecturers of the lectures should use vivid examples to illustrate how to implement the principles of the Party Constitution and how to apply the principles of the Party Constitution to the Party's practical work. If the study of the Party Constitution is not carried out abstractly, but is closely linked to life and closely linked to the Party's practical activities, then new Party members will better understand the principles of the Party Constitution and better understand their obligations and rights.

    The ideological and political education of probationary Party members is not limited to courses in political schools and groups. In many Party organizations, attention is paid to making probationary Party members read newspapers, magazines, and literary works, as well as conducting individual and collective friendly talks with probationary Party members. The secretaries of grassroots organizations, the responsible comrades and secretaries of various departments in district committees and municipal committees, can help leaders become more familiar with probationary Party members and better cultivate them to join the Party by holding such talks.

    The education of probationary Party members, like the education of all Communist Party members, relies on the level of Party work in grassroots organizations and depends on the degree to which the principle of democracy within the Party is implemented. One of the most important methods of educating and training Communist Party members is Party meetings. Long ago, the Central Committee of the Party pointed this out, tasking Party organizations to ensure that "Party members receive Bolshevik education in the daily practical work of the branch. To this end, the discussion and resolution of specific issues at branch meetings must conform to the Party's policies and instructions."

    However, in many grassroots Party organizations, the role of Party meetings is not fully recognized, meetings are not held regularly, and the preparation work for meetings is not done well. At meetings, there is often a limitation to discussing business issues, and little attention is paid to the Party's organizational work and ideological education work. Therefore, the meetings are lifeless, lack the necessary criticism and self-criticism, and do not consider the suggestions and criticisms of ordinary Communist Party members. Obviously, such meetings are of little help to the education of Party members. This is why new Party members in some Party organizations are not active enough at Party meetings. There are also cases where some people have only spoken once at meetings—when they narrated their history when they were admitted to the Party. For example, at the Party meetings held throughout 1952, not a single probationary Party member spoke at the Party organization of the locomotive depot in Povorino District, Voronezh Oblast.

    Article 54 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union emphasizes the great significance of Party meetings in the life of Party organizations. The Party congress is the highest leading body of the Party organization. Party congresses are held at least once a month. These meetings should be better than many Party meetings are now. Party organizations should pay special attention to new Party members who speak for the first time at meetings of grassroots organizations. It often happens that some people want to speak at meetings, but they do not have the courage. Even if they have the courage to speak, they are also flustered. Therefore, it is important to support and encourage these comrades, and inappropriate jokes or comments are not allowed. The caring attitude of the person presiding over the meeting can help the speaker overcome embarrassment and timidity; and it will make him dare to actively participate in Party meetings in the future.

    It is best to examine the personal qualities of probationary Party members in vivid, practical work. However, Party organizations in many places rarely absorb probationary Party members into their activities, nor do they assign them Party work. Some leaders are afraid that probationary Party members will not be able to complete their tasks smoothly, so they would rather give the tasks to trained Party members than to probationary Party members. This "excessive caution" will harm the education of probationary Party members.

    In some Party organizations, only a small portion of Communist Party members are absorbed into work. At the plenary session of the Vladimir Oblast Committee, it was pointed out that less than half of the members of the Party organization of the "Free Proletariat" factory have tasks, forming a situation where some people bear too much work, while others do not do any Party work. As the Party organization has developed and the number of people has increased, the secretaries of grassroots organizations sometimes do not know what tasks should be assigned to whom. This situation mostly occurs where the secretaries are inexperienced and the district committee does not provide enough help to them. The activities of grassroots organizations are multifaceted, and there are places where every Communist Party member can exert their strength.

    Party secretaries and Party organizers often assign Party tasks to Party members not at Party congresses or committee meetings, but by assigning tasks. This reduces the Party members' sense of responsibility for completing tasks. Of course, the situation where Party secretaries and Party organizers assign work tasks to Party members in their work cannot be completely avoided. If things are urgent and cannot wait for the Party organization's meeting, this can be done. However, Party secretaries and Party organizers should assign many tasks to probationary Party members or Party members at the Party congress. If not at the plenary session, it can also be arranged at the Party meetings of the workshop, the Party group's meeting, or the Party organization committee's meeting. This can enhance the Communist Party members' sense of responsibility for completing tasks. When Party organization secretaries assign tasks to probationary Party members, they should promote their initiative, making them often feel that they are Communist Party members and are ready to overcome various difficulties in their work, rather than simply treating it as a task assigned by the Party.

    Educating probationary Party members is the responsibility of the entire Party organization. But this does not mean that Party members cannot be entrusted to provide various assistance to probationary Party members. For example, in terms of studying Marxist-Leninist theory or implementing Party tasks. To give an example, suppose a probationary Party member is assigned to hold a discussion meeting in the workshop, but he has never held a discussion meeting before. Obviously, he will have difficulties. Therefore, it is necessary to entrust a Party member with experience in holding discussion meetings to help this probationary Party member. The experienced Party member will tell this new comrade where to obtain materials, what kind of materials to obtain, what issues to pay attention to, and how to collect examples from the lives of all workers and the actual work of the Party organization. When the probationary Party member has completed the task, he should be talked to in order to understand what problems he encountered when holding the discussion meeting and what issues he should pay attention to in the future. It is also necessary to provide assistance when probationary Party members are performing other tasks.

    When Party organizations supervise the probationary period, they should pay attention to the boundary between Communist Party members and probationary Party members. There have been cases where this boundary has been blurred: probationary Party members vote together with all Party members at Party congresses, some are elected to the presidium of the congress, and some are even elected as leaders of Party groups. In addition, there are also facts that the boundary between grassroots organizations and groups of probationary Party members is unclear. In a district in Velikie Luki Oblast, probationary Party members passed resolutions on admitting Party members, and the district committee also approved the resolutions. This kind of violation of the Party Constitution cannot be tolerated.

    The task of Party organizations is to constantly observe each probationary Party member. They may make mistakes and have shortcomings in their work. They should be helped to correct their shortcomings, and the reasons for their mistakes should be analyzed with them, and they should be told how to act in certain situations. Party organizations cannot allow administrative orders to replace the assistance and education work for probationary Party members. However, there are cases where Party organizations give probationary Party members severe Party disciplinary actions soon after they join the ranks of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Sometimes, probationary Party members make mistakes because they do not know all the requirements that the Party makes of a Party member. The secretaries of grassroots Party organizations and the staff of district committees often do not explain in detail to probationary Party members the obligations, discipline, and procedures for Party members to transfer from one Party organization to another as stipulated in the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Sometimes probationary Party members violate these rules and requirements because they do not know them.

    Here is an example: Due to the negligence of the secretary of the grassroots organization and the staff of the district committee, a probationary Party member became a violator of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Comrade Chukanova, who was admitted as a probationary Party member in August 1952, was sent from Troitsk District, Altai Krai, to Moscow in November 1952 to participate in a six-month training class for accountants. No one clearly explained to her that when going to this training class—the journey is so far—she should obtain a certificate of temporary cancellation of Party registration from the district committee, and when she arrived in Moscow, she should give this certificate to the relevant district committee and be temporarily incorporated into the Party organization so that she could attend Party meetings, participate in Party work, and pay Party dues on time.

    Without this certificate, Comrade Chukanova could not register as a Party member in Moscow, could not be incorporated into the Party organization, and no one collected her Party dues. She was outside the circle of Party life, became a violator of Party discipline, and could have automatically left the Party for failing to pay Party dues on time. After she wrote to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Troitsk District Committee cared about issuing her the appropriate certificate. If the secretary of the Troitsk District Committee had simply explained to her the procedures for Communist Party members to transfer from one organization to another when she was admitted as a probationary Party member and issued her a probationary Party member certificate, then she would not have gone to Moscow without the certificate from the district committee, and she would not have violated Party discipline.

    From the first day of joining the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, probationary Party members should truly understand the Party's requirements for discipline. Secretaries of grassroots organizations and secretaries of district committees should greatly help probationary Party members in this regard. Many district committees have good regulations: when the secretaries of district committees issue Party membership cards and the secretaries of grassroots organizations register probationary Party members, they should make probationary Party members aware of their obligations, know the system of paying Party dues, and the procedures for Party members to transfer from one organization to another as stipulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Everyone who joins the Communist Party of the Soviet Union must nominate three Party members as introducers. As everyone knows, these introducers are of great significance to the work of admitting Party members. However, introducers usually believe that the task of the introducer has been completed after the person being introduced joins the Party. This is incorrect. Introducers should help comrades who are still in the probationary period without waiting for the Party organization's assignment.

    Party organizations are responsible for probationary Party members during the probationary period and should help probationary Party members prepare to join the Party in accordance with the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Every Party organization must successfully complete this task.

    × × ×

    The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out that many Party organizations have not done a good job in helping probationary Party members prepare to join the Party and have not paid attention to examining their personal qualities; therefore, the probationary period often becomes an empty formality, extending the probationary period of many probationary Party members for several years.

    In order to increase the sense of responsibility of Party organizations and probationary Party members themselves during the probationary period, the Party Constitution adopted by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union added new provisions that task Party organizations with helping probationary Party members prepare to join the Party. According to Article 18 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, at the end of the probationary period, Party organizations should handle the issue of probationary Party members at Party meetings. Regarding this issue, Party organizations have the right to extend the probationary period of probationary Party members, but it shall not exceed one year. If it is found that they are not suitable for joining the Party due to their personal qualities, their qualifications as probationary Party members can be revoked.

    When Party organizations implement the instructions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, they have begun to pay more attention to the political awareness of probationary Party members and the improvement of their cultural level, and have begun to more widely absorb probationary Party members into Party work. However, in many Party organizations, the shortcomings in the work of probationary Party members pointed out by the 19th Party Congress have not yet been overcome. There are still many overdue probationary Party members; although most of them are honest people who are loyal to the cause of communism and sincerely hope to join the Communist Party. Why are there still so many overdue probationary Party members in some Party organizations? It is because educational work has not been carried out well for probationary Party members. District committees and municipal committees rarely guide the secretaries of grassroots organizations on how to implement the instructions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the work of probationary Party members; at the standing committee meetings of district committees and municipal committees, reports from grassroots Party organizations on the work of probationary Party members are rarely heard. In many Party organizations, the work of probationary Party members has not been brought up for discussion at the plenary meetings of Party committees. At Party meetings, Party organization secretaries rarely report on how probationary Party members are studying, how they are implementing Party tasks, and how they are preparing to join the Party. Probationary Party members themselves rarely express their opinions on this issue at Party meetings.

    The fact that the facts of Article 18 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union cannot be correctly explained can only be proved by the weak leadership of district committees and municipal committees in this regard. Some secretaries of district committees and secretaries of grassroots Party organizations mistakenly believe that this article is actually to "clean up" probationary Party members and more quickly "liberate" those overdue probationary Party members. For example, the Yeranetsk District Committee (Nikolaev Oblast) tasked the secretaries of grassroots organizations with overdue probationary Party members to discuss the issue of probationary Party members at regular Party meetings, and suggested: "Go through the formalities for joining the Party or revoke the qualifications of probationary Party members." The incorrect instructions given by the district committee to grassroots Party organizations have been repealed by the Oblast Committee.

    Of course, patiently carrying out the work of probationary Party members and helping probationary Party members prepare to join the Party is arduous work. It is certainly easier to hastily pass resolutions revoking the qualifications of probationary Party members whose probationary period has expired. Not long ago, the workshop Party organization in a factory in Dagestan expelled a probationary Party member, saying that this probationary Party member did not perform well enough and could not understand the educational content of political classes. In fact, this probationary Party member joined the Party at the front line in 1945, had been rewarded by the government several times for his military achievements during the Great Patriotic War; in the factory, he also consistently exceeded production quotas, helped young workers master technology, participated in social life, and studied in political groups. The factory Party committee revoked the incorrect decision of the workshop Party organization and suggested that the Party organization help this probationary Party member prepare to join the Party.

    Some Party organization staff members believe that Article 18 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union only applies to those probationary Party members who joined the Party after the 19th Party Congress or whose probationary period has not been overdue for a long time. This incorrect interpretation hinders the review of the issue of overdue probationary Party members. Some Party organizations, on the contrary, focus all their attention on probationary Party members who have been overdue for a long time; forgetting about probationary Party members who were recently admitted, resulting in these probationary Party members again experiencing the phenomenon of overdue probationary periods. From this, it can be seen that when Party organizations examine the issue of overdue probationary Party members at plenary sessions and help them prepare to join the Party, they should not weaken their work with the remaining probationary Party members.

    Party organizations sometimes turn extending the probationary period into a method of Party punishment. There are people whose probationary periods have been extended for violating Party discipline, losing probationary Party member certificates, and immoral behavior. This phenomenon cannot be tolerated. In some places, when reviewing the issue of overdue probationary Party members, decisions were made to extend the probationary period by one month to three months. The District Committee of the Hohhot Party (Voronezh Oblast) approved the decision of the grassroots Party organization to extend the probationary period of two probationary Party members by one month and the probationary period of three probationary Party members by two months. In the grassroots Party organization of Buturlinovsky District, five probationary Party members were extended their probationary period by one month due to insufficient political cultivation. Is this decision correct? No, it is incorrect. Extending the probationary period for such a short time means treating this issue formalistically. For example, in the Kalinin Oblast, there was such a thing that when the district committee approved the decision of the grassroots organization to extend the probationary period (one month), the supplementary probationary period had already expired.

    Extending the probationary period is necessary so that the Party organization can better examine the probationary Party member and give the probationary Party member the opportunity to express themselves. Later, it can be confidently resolved whether he is worthy of this noble title of Party member. But can the probationary Party member be examined and determined whether he can obtain the honor of becoming a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in such a short period—one month, two months, or three months? Of course, it is impossible.

    Secretaries of grassroots organizations often ask: How should the issue of probationary Party members be reviewed at Party meetings; should the Party organization raise the issue of probationary Party members itself or wait for probationary Party members to submit applications for extending the deadline? Grassroots organizations should not require probationary Party members to submit such applications. Grassroots organizations should take the initiative to bring the issue of probationary Party members who have reached the end of their term to Party meetings; at the same time, the Party organization secretary or committee should carefully analyze and comprehensively study the specific circumstances of probationary periods that have been exceeded in advance. If the Party organization secretary (committee) knows that a probationary Party member is going through the formalities for joining the Party, and that he needs another month to complete this matter, there is no need to discuss the issue of extending this probationary period by one month at the plenary session, as long as the secretary reports this matter to the Party meeting.

    The ending part of Article 18 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union points out that the decisions of the Party's grassroots organizations on extending the probationary period or revoking the qualifications of probationary Party members shall only be effective after being approved by the Party's district committee or municipal committee. Must these resolutions of district committees and municipal committees be approved by the Oblast Committee, the Krai Committee, or the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Republics, or do these decisions not need to be submitted to the higher-level Party organs for review?

    The Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union does not require the Oblast Committee, the Krai Committee, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Republics to approve these resolutions of the district committee or municipal committee. If it is found during the probationary period that a probationary Party member is not suitable to be admitted to the Party due to his personal qualities, the Party's grassroots organization can revoke his qualification as a probationary Party member for this reason. At the same time, according to the provisions of Article 18 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, this resolution can take effect after being approved by the district committee and the municipal committee, and does not need to be submitted to the Oblast Committee, the Krai Committee, or the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Republics for approval. The certificate of the probationary Party member whose qualification has been revoked shall be returned after being approved by the district committee or the municipal committee. Of course, the person whose qualification has been revoked can appeal to the higher-level Party organs. The Oblast Committee, the Krai Committee, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Republics should review such cases of revoking Party membership in the petition.

    But not all resolutions of the district committee or municipal committee on revoking the qualification of probationary Party members do not need to be approved by the higher-level Party organs. For example, if a probationary Party member is expelled due to some kind of fault, according to the provisions of Article 10 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, this resolution of the district committee or municipal committee shall only be effective when approved by the Party's Oblast Committee, the Krai Committee, or the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Republics. In this case, the certificate of the probationary Party member whose qualification has been revoked can only be returned after being approved by the Party's Oblast Committee, the Krai Committee, or the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Republics.

    The resolution of the grassroots organization on extending the probationary period shall be recorded in the registration form of the probationary Party member after being approved by the district committee and the municipal committee in accordance with the procedures stipulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. No notes related to the extension of the deadline are made on the probationary Party member certificate held by the probationary Party member. The appropriate records on the probationary Party member registration form are necessary, because when a probationary Party member transfers from one organization to another, without a record of the extension of the probationary period, it will cause unnecessary document exchanges. When the district committee registers such probationary Party members transferred from other organizations, it will have to inquire with the place where he originally worked whether the extension of his probationary period is true and when it will be extended. And this will delay the solution of the probationary Party member's issue of joining the Party to a certain extent.

    In the register of Party members who have been probationary Party members and have rejoined the Party, the period of interruption of Party standing shall be noted in accordance with the general rules. It shall also be recorded in the Party membership card, registration form, and report form.

    This is also an important issue: Can the district committee and the municipal committee change the resolution of the grassroots organization on extending the probationary period or revoking the qualification of the probationary Party member? Yes, the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union authorizes the district committee and the municipal committee to approve the resolutions of the grassroots organizations, and they can change any resolution of the grassroots organization concerning probationary Party members.

    If the district committee helps the secretaries of grassroots organizations more in solving these problems, then the errors and shortcomings in the implementation of the provisions of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on probationary Party members are easy to prevent and eliminate.

    If Party organizations are familiar with probationary Party members, do not treat them in a formalistic and generalized way, but treat them separately, then the task of educating probationary Party members, absorbing them into actively participating in Party life and social life, that is, the work of cultivating them to join the Party, can be successfully completed. The various probationary Party members differ in their political cultivation and social education, and the nature of their work is also different. Party organizations should take these into account. They should know the weaknesses and strengths of each probationary Party member, his requirements and hobbies, what his interests are, the situation of his production work, how he performs in social life, and how he fights for the cause of the Communist Party. Treating Communist Party members separately is the foundation of the Party's education. This principle must also be followed when admitting probationary Party members.

    Strengthening the ideological and political education of probationary Party members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union should first take the further improvement of the Party's internal work of the Party organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as a prerequisite. Party organizations should constantly educate probationary Party members, improve their ideological level, and make them politically cultivated and conscious Communist Party members.

    候补期的意义和对候补党员的工作
    苏联　斯·库尔金
    编者按：这篇文章是苏联“共产党人”杂志编辑部对许多读者所提问题的答复。读者们给“共产党人”写信要求说明候补期的意义和党组织怎样进行候补党员的工作。这同样是我国许多读者所关心的问题。因此，我们把这篇文章译载在这里。
    关于党员资格的问题是党的建设的根本问题。共产党经常关怀着自己队伍的纯洁，关怀着改善自己的成员和提高党员的称号。谁都知道，党的成员在很大的程度内决定着党的团结性、纪律性、自觉性，最后还决定着党的决议的命运。
    共产党之所以有力量，不仅在于党员的数量，而首先在于党员的质量。党在巨大的共产主义建设的新任务面前，要求每个党员对党的事业有更高的责任心。马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上关于苏联共产党中央委员会的工作的总结报告中指出，必须继续改善党的质量，不允许追求数量，而要集中力量来提高党员和候补党员的政治水平和马克思主义的修养，提高共产党员的政治积极性，使全体党员都成为争取实现党的政策和决议的坚强战士。
    在第十九次党代表大会上所通过的苏联共产党党章中所表述的对党员的明确的要求，完全符合于党在现阶段的任务。实现党章的条例，就会更加巩固党的纪律，加强共产党员的积极性和主动性以及他们在共产主义建设中的先锋作用。
    在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会对党章所提出的关于候补党员的补充条文，便体现了党对自己队伍的纯洁和质量的关怀。这些补充条文的通过，就是为了改善党组织对候补党员的工作，并加强候补党员自己对候补期的责任心。
    为什么参加苏联共产党队伍的每个人都必须经过候补期呢？这个候补期的意义何在呢？
    苏联共产党党章中指出，候补期之所以必要，是为了使候补党员熟悉党纲、党章、党的策略，并使党的组织得以考察候补党员个人的品质。
    在苏联共产党党章第三条中，对党员在共产主义建设现阶段的义务做了详尽的规定。党员应尽力卫护党的统一，因为党的统一是党强大有力的主要条件；党员必须是为实现党的决议而斗争的积极战士；在劳动中起模范作用，尽力爱护和巩固社会主义公有制；每日加强与群众的联系；领会马克思列宁主义基础；遵守党和国家的纪律，开展自我批评和自下而上的批评；向党的领导机关直至党的中央委员会报告工作中的缺点，不管报告牵涉到什么人；对党忠诚老实；保守党和国家的机密；坚决执行党关于正确挑选干部的指示。
    显然，每一个参加苏联共产党的人都应该有决心去正确地执行党的一切指示，履行共产党员的义务。候补期在教育共产党员方面有着重大的意义，在候补期党要考察每个候补党员对共产主义事业的忠诚、政治觉悟和纪律性，以及他的品质。
    党的中央委员会、列宁和斯大林已不止一次地指出候补期和对候补党员的思想教育工作的意义。乌·伊·列宁要求采用严格的规则以使候补期真正成为严重的考验，而不是空洞的形式。
    党把接收新党员的工作、候补党员的工作和对他们的教育工作看作是互相不可分割的工作。关于这一点在党的许多文件中——代表大会、代表会议和中央委员会的决议中，都曾不止一次地提到过。例如，在一九三五年十二月，党中央委员会全体会议所通过的关于检查党证工作的总结报告的决定中就指出过：“联共（布）中央委员会全体会议坚决指责在许多党组织中所发生的这种事实：当接收了新党员或候补党员以后就把他们忘记了，没有对这些新的、还没有成熟的和没有领会布尔什维克组织性的一切传统的党员，表示关怀。”稍后，在一九三八年，中央委员会在“关于接收联共（布）新党员的程序”决议中，责成党组织把对待新党员的工作当作最重要的任务，要以布尔什维克的党性精神来教育新党员，并吸收他们参加党的工作和社会的工作。在中央委员会的以后的若干决议中，也曾向党组织提出了类似这样的指示。
    由此可见，共产党对自己新的补充队伍的教育是多么重视，候补期的意义是多么重大。

    党组织怎样对候补党员进行工作呢？
    候补期应成为党的教育和锻炼的学校。这就是说，应当很好地安排候补党员的马克思列宁主义的学习，积极吸收他们参加党的生活，考察每个候补党员个人的品质是否能成为一个党员。
    苏联共产党中央委员会在若干决议中具体地说明了如何安排新党员的教育工作。例如，在一九五一年八月所通过的关于高尔基州委会接收新党员入党工作的决议中，中央委员会建议州委会提高基层组织、区委会和市委会对培养候补党员转为党员的责任心，以使候补期真正用来教育和考察候补党员的个人品质并使候补党员熟悉党纲、党章和党的策略。中央委员会向党的基层组织、区委会和市委会提出了这样的任务：积极吸收候补党员参加社会生活和党的生活，关心他们，使他们都能完成党的委托，出席党的会议，严格遵守党和国家的纪律，提高自己的思想政治水平和业务水平。
    党组织最重要的任务之一，就是从思想上来武装新党员，关心他们使他们能够理解党的政策，懂得党对自己的党员所提出来的要求的实质。根据苏联共产党党章的规定，每个共产党员应当“努力提高自己的觉悟，领会马克思列宁主义基础”。党组织的责任，就是帮助共产党员去履行学习马克思列宁主义的这个义务。提高党员和候补党员的政治水平，是加强他们在一切生活领域中的先锋作用，是使党员群众更加积极和改善党组织工作的必要条件。
    然而，事实证明有些党组织醉心于事务而忘记了思想工作，对于党员的思想、政治教育工作仍然很少注意，宣传工作仍然组织得不好。在学习马克思列宁主义理论方面，候补党员是需要更多的帮助的，而有些党组织的书记却非常简单地来处理这件工作，他们认为只要把候补党员编入小组或学校那就算万事大吉了。这种形式主义的工作态度会使许多候补党员不能好好地学习。党组织书记应当了解每个候补党员在政治学校或小组里的学习情况；应当考虑和满足候补党员的要求；关心候补党员对苏联共产党党章的学习。为此，党组织委员会或书记应当为候补党员设立专门的课程，为他们组织关于党章的讲座。讲座的领导者、讲课者要用生动的例子来说明怎样实现党章的原则，怎样把党章的原则运用到党的实际工作中去。如果学习党章时不是抽象地进行，而是与生活紧密联系，与党的实际活动紧密联系着，那末新党员会更好地领会党章的原则，去更好地理解自己的义务与权利。
    候补党员的思想政治教育不仅限于政治学校和小组的课程。在许多党组织里，注意到使候补党员阅读报纸、杂志和文学作品，以及与候补党员进行个别的和集体的友谊谈话。基层组织的书记，区委会、市委会中各部门的负责同志和书记来进行这种谈话，可以帮助领导者们更熟悉候补党员，更好地培养他们入党。
    候补党员的教育，也像对所有的共产党员的教育一样，是依靠于基层组织的党的工作水平，是取决于党内的民主原则贯彻的程度。教育和锻炼共产党员的最重要的方法之一，就是党的会议。很早以前，党中央委员会就指出了这一点，它责成党组织要做到使“党员在支部的日常的实际工作中受到布尔什维克的教育，为此在支部的会议上讨论和解决具体问题时，必须符合党的政策和指示”。
    但是，在许多党的基层组织中，对党的会议的作用认识不足，会议不能经常召开，会议的准备工作做得不好。在会议上往往局限于讨论业务问题，对于党的组织工作和思想教育工作问题则很少注意。因此，会议进行得没有生气，缺乏应有的批评和自我批评，不考虑普通共产党员的建议和批评。显然，这种会议很少有助于党员的教育工作。在某些党组织中，新党员在党的会议上所以表现得不够积极就在于此。也有这样的情形，有些人在会议上只发过一次言——就是在被接收入党时叙述过自己的历史。例如，沃龙涅什州波沃林斯克区机车库的党组织，在一九五二年全年中举行的党的会议上，就没有一个候补党员发言。
    苏联共产党党章第五十四条强调指出党的会议在党组织生活中的重大意义。党员大会是党组织的最高领导机关。党员大会至少每月召开一次。这种会议应开得比现在许多党的会议要好。对于在基层组织的会议上首次发言的新党员，党组织应特别注意。时常有这种情况：有的人想在会议上说话，可是又没有勇气。即令他有勇气说话，在说话时也是张皇失措。因此，支持和鼓励这些同志是很重要的，不允许不适当的戏言或评语。主持会议的人关心的态度可以帮助说话者克服窘困、畏缩；而且使他以后敢于积极地参加党的会议。
    最好是在生动的，实际的工作中来考察候补党员的个人品质。但是许多地方的党组织很少吸收候补党员参加自己的活动，也不分配他们作党的工作。有的领导者恐怕候补党员不能顺利地完成任务，所以宁愿把任务交给受过锻炼的党员而不愿交给候补党员。这种“过分的小心”，会使候补党员的教育工作受到损害。
    在某些党组织中，仅仅有一小部分共产党员被吸收参加工作。在弗拉基米尔州委会全体会议上指出了：在“自由无产阶级”工厂的党组织成员中有任务的人不到一半，形成了有一些人担负工作过多，另一些人则任何党的工作也不作。由于党组织发展了，人数增多了，基层组织的书记有时就不知道把什么样的任务应该分配给什么样的人。这种情形大多发生在书记经验不足，区委会对他的帮助不够的地方。基层组织的活动是多方面的，是可以使每一个共产党员都有发挥力量的地方。
    党的书记、党的组织员时常不是在党员大会或委员会的会议上，而是以分配工作的方式把党的任务分配给党员。这会降低党员完成任务的责任心。当然，党的书记和党的组织员在工作中分配党员工作任务的情况是不能完全避免的，如果事情紧急，不能等待党组织的会议，是可以这样作的。但是，党的书记和党的组织员要交给候补党员或党员许多任务，是可以在党员大会上布置的，如果不是在全体大会上，也可以在车间的党的会议、党小组的会议或党组织委员会的会议上来布置。这可以提高共产党员完成任务的责任心。党组织的书记把任务交给候补党员时，应当发扬他们的自觉精神，使他们常常感到自己是一个共产党员，随时去克服工作中的各种困难，而不只是简单地当作这是党所分配的任务。
    教育候补党员是整个党组织的责任。但并不是说，就不能委托党员对候补党员进行各种帮助。例如，在学习马克思列宁主义理论或执行党的任务方面。举个例子说吧，分配一个候补党员在车间召开座谈会，但他从来没有召开过座谈会，显然，他是会有困难的。因此，委托一个有召开座谈会经验的党员去帮助这个候补党员，这是必要的。有经验的党员会告诉这位新同志，在那里取得材料，要取得什么样的材料，要注意些什么问题以及怎样从全体工人的生活和党组织的实际工作搜集事例。当候补党员完成了任务以后，就应当和他谈话，了解他在举行座谈会时曾发生过什么问题，今后应该注意些什么问题。在候补党员执行其他任务时也需要给他们帮助。
    党组织对候补期进行监督时，应当注意到共产党员和候补党员之间的界限。曾发生过这样界限混淆不清的事情：候补党员在党员大会上和全体党员一起投票表决，有的被选入大会主席团，甚至被选为党小组的领导人。此外，还有基层组织和一群候补党员之间界限分不清的事实。在维里科鲁克州的一个区，候补党员们通过了接收党员的决议，同时区委会还批准了这个决议。这种破坏党章的情况是不能容许的。
    党组织的任务，就是经常地注视每个候补党员。他们在工作中可能会发生错误和缺点，应当帮助他们改正缺点，和他们一起分析犯错误的原因，告诉他们在某些场合下应该怎样去活动。党组织里是不能容许以行政命令来代替对候补党员的帮助和教育工作的。可是有这样的事情，党组织在候补党员参加苏联共产党的队伍不久就给他们以党的严厉处分。
    有时，候补党员犯错误是因为不知道党向一个党员所提出的一切要求。基层党组织书记、区委会书记往往不向候补党员详细说明苏联共产党党章对共产党员所规定的义务、纪律以及党员从一个党组织转到另一个党组织的手续。有时候补党员就是因为不知道而破坏了这些规则和要求。
    这就是一个例子：由于基层组织书记和区委会的工作人员疏忽，使一个候补党员成为了苏联共产党党章的破坏者。一九五二年八月被接收为候补党员的楚卡诺娃同志，在一九五二年十一月从阿尔泰边疆区特洛伊茨克区被派到莫斯科参加会计人员半年训练班学习。谁也没有清楚地对她说明，到这个训练班去时——路途是这么远——应当在区委会去领取临时注销党员登记的证明书，到了莫斯科的时候把这个证明书交给有关的区委会并临时编入党的组织，以便出席党的会议，参加党的工作并按期缴纳党费。
    没有这种证明书，楚卡诺娃同志就不能在莫斯科办理党员登记，不能编入党组织，也没有人收她的党费。她处在党的生活圈外，成为了党的纪律的破坏者，并可能因为没有按期缴付党费就自然而然地脱离了党。在她给苏联共产党中央委员会去了信后，特洛伊茨克区委会才关怀到应发给她适当的证明书。假如特洛伊茨克区委会书记在接收楚卡诺娃同志为候补党员、发给她候补党员证书时，即使简单地向她说明了共产党员从一个组织转到另一个组织的手续，那末，她一定不会没有区委会的证明书就到莫斯科去，也不会破坏党的纪律。
    候补党员从参加苏联共产党第一天起，就应当切实领会党关于纪律的要求。基层组织书记、区委会书记应在这方面大大地帮助候补党员。在许多区委会里有很好的规定：区委会书记在发给党证时，基层组织书记在接收候补党员登记时，要使候补党员认识到他们的义务，知道缴纳党费的制度以及苏联共产党中央委员会所规定的关于党员从一个组织转到另一个组织的手续。
    每一个参加苏联共产党的人要提出三个党员作介绍人。谁都知道，这些介绍人，对接收党员入党工作是有很重大的意义的。但是，通常介绍人在被介绍人入党之后，就认为介绍人的任务已经完结。这是不正确的。介绍人不要等待党组织的委托，就应当帮助还在候补期的同志。
    党组织对候补期中的候补党员负责，并按苏联共产党党章的规定，应当帮助候补党员准备入党。每个党组织都必须成功地完成这个任务。

    苏联共产党第十九次代会大会指出：许多党组织对帮助候补党员准备入党的工作做得很不好，没有注意考察他们个人的品质；因此候补期往往变成空洞的形式，使许多候补党员的候补期延长好几年。
    为了提高党组织和候补党员自己对候补期的责任心，苏联共产党第十九次代表大会所通过的党章补充了新条文，这些新条文责成党组织帮助候补党员准备入党。根据苏联共产党党章第十八条的规定，在候补期届满时，党组织应在党的会议上处理候补党员的问题。关于这个问题，党组织有权延长候补党员的候补期，但不得超过一年。如果发现由于他的个人品质不宜接收入党，可以取消他的候补党员资格。
    党组织在执行苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的指示时，已开始更加关怀候补党员的政治觉悟和他们的文化水平的提高，开始更广泛地吸收候补党员参加党的工作。但是在许多党组织里至今仍没有克服第十九次党代表大会所指出的对候补党员的工作中的缺点。还有不少过期的候补党员；尽管他们大多数都是忠于共产主义事业的正直的人，诚恳地希望参加共产党的人。为什么有些党组织中还有许多过期的候补党员呢？就因为对候补党员没有很好地进行教育工作。区委会和市委会很少指导基层组织书记怎样去实现苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于候补党员工作的指示；在区委会和市委会的常委会上，很少听取基层党组织关于候补党员工作的报告，在许多党组织里，关于候补党员的工作没有提到党委会全体会议上来讨论。在党的会议上，党组织书记很少报告候补党员如何进行学习、如何执行党的任务，如何准备入党。候补党员自己也很少在党的会议上对这个问题发表意见。
    不能正确地解释苏联共产党党章第十八条的事实，只能用区委会和市委会这方面领导不强来证明。某些区委会书记和基层党组织书记错误地认为这一条实际上是为了“清除”候补党员并更迅速地“解放”那些过期的候补党员。例如，耶拉涅茨克区委会（尼古拉也夫州）责成凡是有过期的候补党员的基层组织的书记在党的例会上要讨论候补党员的问题，并且建议：“办理入党手续或取消候补党员资格”。区委会给基层党组织的不正确的指示，已被州委会废止了。
    当然，耐心地进行候补党员的工作、帮助候补党员准备入党，是件繁重的工作。匆忙地通过取消候补期已过的候补党员资格的决议，当然要容易得多。不久以前达格斯坦一个工厂中的车间党组织开除了一个候补党员，说是这个候补党员表现得不够好，不能够领会政治课的教育内容。其实，这个候补党员是一九四五年在前线入党的，在伟大卫国战争期间因为战功曾几次得到政府的奖励；在工厂里，他也一贯地超额完成生产定额，他帮助青年工人掌握技术，参加社会生活，在政治小组学习。工厂党委会取消了车间党组织的不正确的决定，并建议党组织帮助这个候补党员准备入党。
    某些党组织的工作人员认为，苏联共产党党章第十八条只是适用于第十九次党代表大会后入党的或超过候补期不长的那些候补党员。这种不正确的解释阻碍了对过期的候补党员问题的审查。还有些党组织相反地把全部注意都集中在过期很久的候补党员的身上；忘记了不久以前接收的候补党员，结果这些候补党员又产生了候补期过期的现象。由此可见，党组织在全体大会上考察过期的候补党员的问题、帮助他们准备入党时，不应当削弱对其余的候补党员的工作。
    党组织有时把延长候补期变成党的处罚的方法。就有人因为破坏党的纪律、遗失候补党员证书和不道德的行为而被延长候补期。这种现象是不能容许的。有的地方在审查过期的候补党员的问题时，通过了把候补期延长一个月—三个月的决定。霍霍尔党的区委会（沃龙涅什州）批准了基层党组织关于延长两个候补党员的候补期一个月，三个候补党员的候补期两个月的决定。布图尔里诺夫斯克区的基层党组织中，有五个候补党员因为政治修养不够而被延长了一个月的候补期。这种决定正确吗？不，不正确的。把候补期延长这么短，这就是说形式主义地对待这个问题。例如，在加里宁州曾有这样的事情，基层组织关于延长候补期（一个月）的决定被区委会批准时，补充规定的候补期限已经满了。
    延长候补期之所以必要，是为了使党组织能够更好地审查候补党员，使候补党员有表现自己的可能。以后就可以有把握地解决他是否无愧于这个崇高的党员称号。可是能不能在这么短的期间——一个月、两个月或三个月——来考察候补党员和决定他能否获得成为一个苏联共产党党员的荣誉呢？当然是不可能的。
    基层组织书记往往要问：怎样在党的会议上来审查候补党员的问题；应当党组织自己提出关于候补党员的问题还是等待候补党员提出延长期限的申请书呢？基层组织不应当要求候补党员提出这样的申请书。基层组织应主动地把期满的候补党员的问题提到党的会议上来；同时党组织书记或委员会应当预先仔细地分析和全面研究超过候补期的具体情况。如果党组织书记（委员会）知道，某一个候补党员正在办理入党手续，而且他还需要一个月的时间来办理这件事，就没有必要在全体大会上来讨论这个候补期延长一个月的问题，只要书记把这件事报告给党的会议就可以了。
    苏联共产党党章第十八条结尾部分指出，党的基层组织关于延长候补期或取消候补党员资格的决议，要经过党的区委会或市委会批准后，方始有效。区委会、市委会的这些决议是否必须经过州委会、边疆区委会、加盟共和国共产党中央委员会批准，或者这些决定无需送交上级党的机关审查呢？
    苏联共产党党章没有要求州委会、边疆区委会和加盟共和国共产党中央委员会批准区委会或市委会的这些决议。如果在候补期间查明候补党员由于他个人品质不宜被吸收入党，党的基层组织按此理由可以取消他的候补党员的资格，同时，根据苏联共产党党章第十八条的规定，这个决议在区委会和市委会批准后就能生效，不必送交州委会、边疆区委会、加盟共和国共产党中央委员会批准。被取消资格的候补党员的证书，在区委会或市委会批准之后就要收回。当然，被取消资格的人可以向上级党机关提出申诉。州委会、边疆区委会、加盟共和国共产党中央委员会应审查申诉书里关于取消党籍的这类事情。
    但并不是区委会或市委会关于取消候补党员资格的一切决议，都不必由上级党机关批准。例如，候补党员因某种过失被开除，根据苏联共产党党章第十条的规定，区委会或市委会的这个决议，只有在党的州委会、边疆区委会或加盟共和国共产党中央委员会批准时，方始有效。在这种情况下，被取消候补党员资格的证书，只有在党的州委会、边疆区委会、加盟共和国共产党中央委员会批准后，才可收回。
    基层组织关于延长候补期的决议经过区委会、市委会批准后，按苏联共产党中央委员会所规定的程序，要记载在候补党员的登记表上。候补党员持有的候补党员证书上，不做任何有关延长限期的记号。在候补党员登记表上的适当的记载是必要的，因为在候补党员从一个组织转到另一个组织时，没有关于延长候补期的记录，会引起多余文件的往来。区委会登记从别的组织转来的这样的候补党员时，就不得不询问他原来工作的地方他的候补期的延长是否真实，延长到何时。而这在一定程度内将会拖延候补党员入党问题的解决。
    在曾转为候补党员而又重新入党的党员的表册中，按一般的规则要注明党龄中断期。在党证、登记表和报告表中也都要记载上。
    这也是一个重要问题：区委会、市委会能不能改变基层组织关于延长候补期或取消候补党员资格的决议呢？可以的，苏联共产党党章授权区委会、市委会批准基层组织的决议，它们能够改变基层组织任何有关候补党员的决议。
    假如区委会在解决这些问题方面更多地帮助基层组织书记，那末在执行苏联共产党党章关于候补党员的规定中的错误和缺点，是容易防止和消除的。
    假如党组织很熟悉候补党员，不是形式主义的一般化的对待他们，而是有分别地来对待他们，那末，教育候补党员的任务，吸收他们积极参加党的生活和社会生活，也就是培养他们入党的工作，是能够顺利完成的。各个候补党员在政治上的修养。和所受的社会教育是有差别的，工作的性质也各不相同，这些，党组织是应当估计到的。应当知道每个候补党员的弱点和长处，他的要求和爱好，他的兴趣是什么，他的生产工作情况，在社会生活中表现得如何，怎样为共产党的事业而战斗。分别地对待共产党员是党进行教育的基础。在接收候补党员时，也必需遵守这个原则。
    苏联共产党候补党员的思想政治教育的加强，首先要以苏联共产党党组织的党内工作进一步提高为先决条件。党组织应经常教育候补党员，提高他们的思想水平，使他们成为有政治修养和有觉悟的共产党员。（刘竞译自苏联“共产党人”杂志一九五三年第九期）
