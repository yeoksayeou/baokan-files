Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 18th, TASS dispatch: TASS Statement on Soviet Union Testing New Types of Atomic Bombs

    According to the plan for scientific research on atomic energy, the Soviet Union tested several new types of atomic bombs in the past few weeks. The results of the tests were good, fully confirming the calculations and assumptions of scientists and design engineers.

    As long as responsible figures in the United States continue to reject the Soviet Union's repeated proposals for banning atomic weapons, then it is perfectly understandable that the Soviet Union, out of security concerns, must pay attention to the production of atomic weapons. At the same time, the Soviet Union has always strived to reach agreements with other countries to unconditionally ban atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other types of weapons of mass destruction, to greatly reduce armaments, and to establish strict international supervision to supervise the implementation of these resolutions; the Soviet Union will continue to pursue a policy of strengthening international peace.

    At the same time, the Soviet Union is carrying out work to use atomic energy for industrial purposes. The Soviet Union believes that making atomic energy serve the cause of peaceful progress is its most important task.

    苏联最近试验了几种新型的原子弹
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日电：塔斯社关于苏联试验新型原子弹的声明根据原子能科学研究的计划，苏联在前几个星期试验了几种新型的原子弹。试验的结果良好，完全证实了科学家和设计工程师的计算和假定。
    只要美国负责人士继续拒绝苏联一再提出的关于禁用原子武器的建议，那末，苏联从安全的要求出发，不得不注意原子武器的生产，这是十分可以理解的。同时，苏联是始终努力谋求和其他国家达成协议，来无条件禁用原子武器、氢武器和其他类型的有大规模毁灭性的武器，大大裁减军备和建立严格的国际监督以监督这些决议的实施的；苏联将继续执行加强国际和平的政策。
    与此同时，苏联正在进行利用原子能于工业用途的工作。苏联认为使原子能为和平进步事业服务是它最重要的任务。
