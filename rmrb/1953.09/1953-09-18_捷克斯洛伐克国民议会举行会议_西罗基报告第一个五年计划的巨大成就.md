Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 17th: The 78th session of the Czechoslovak National Assembly was held in Prague on the 15th and 16th. Czechoslovak Republic President Zápotocký, Prime Minister Široký, and responsible comrades from the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, various departments of the Republic's government, and people's organizations attended the meeting. Representatives of foreign diplomatic missions in Czechoslovakia were also invited to attend the meeting as observers.

After the opening of the meeting on the 15th, Fierlinger was elected as the new chairman of the National Assembly.

At the afternoon session on the 15th, Prime Minister Široký delivered an important report on behalf of the Republic's government. He reported on the great achievements made by the Czechoslovak people in socialist construction and transformation during the first five-year plan (1949-1953), the tasks currently facing the Republic, and the measures the government has decided to take.

Široký pointed out: The tasks of socialist construction and transformation in Czechoslovakia are being victoriously completed. This year's industrial production has doubled compared to 1948 and will soon exceed the highest industrial level of Czechoslovakia in the capitalist era by a factor of two. This year, the total industrial output will reach the target set by the expanded five-year plan (Note: The original five-year plan stipulated that by the end of 1953, total industrial output should increase by 57 percent compared to 1948, and the expanded five-year plan stipulated an increase of 98 percent). The main result of the socialist construction and transformation carried out during this five-year plan is that today's Czechoslovak economy, especially industrial production, has laid a solid foundation for national independence, national economic strength, and defense. The reason the Czechoslovak working class has been able to achieve these great successes is that it is under the leadership of the Communist Party and has formed a solid alliance with the laboring peasants; because it follows the immortal teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

Široký then summarized the great role played by the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union in these achievements and described the improvement in the living standards and welfare of the working people over the past five years. He said that this year's social insurance and other social and cultural expenditures will reach 22.3 billion crowns (Czech currency), an increase of 81 percent compared to 1949. As early as December 1952, the Czechoslovak Communist Party's representative meeting emphasized that economic development should be further ensured in accordance with the law of proportional development. The Republic's government believes that effective measures must be taken in 1954 to ensure that the development of the various sectors of the national economy is in line with this law. Our most important task is first of all to ensure the extensive development of the raw material base for heavy industry. An equally urgent task is to greatly increase the production of coal and electricity. At the same time, the government will pay attention to ensuring the correct proportional relationship between the production of capital goods and consumer goods, and between the development of industry and agriculture, and to ensuring the establishment of correct proportional relationships between the various production departments. Široký pointed out: Some heavy industry targets in the expanded five-year plan have obviously been set too high, and in this case, the growth of light industry and the food industry has been stipulated to be proportionally too low. However, the victories our country has achieved in economic construction and transformation have created the conditions for further attention to the development of consumer goods production and ensuring the improvement of residents' living standards; the investment rate in heavy industry can be reduced.

When talking about achievements in agriculture, Široký pointed out that half of the villages across the country have now established unified agricultural cooperatives, and the people across the country have achieved important successes in their efforts to develop agricultural production on the basis of cooperatives. But the important task in the future is to ensure the improvement of agricultural production levels. On the basis of providing extensive assistance to farmers, and in the spirit of strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, the government will create economic preconditions for the continuous development of large-scale cooperative production.

Široký also discussed the international situation. He said that the Czechoslovak people will continue to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and expressed agreement and full support for the Soviet government's proposals for a peaceful settlement of the German issue.

On the 16th, the National Assembly continued to meet and warmly discussed Široký's report. The meeting finally unanimously approved Prime Minister Široký's report.

The meeting was then adjourned.

    捷克斯洛伐克国民议会举行会议
    西罗基报告第一个五年计划的巨大成就
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】捷克斯洛伐克国民议会第七十八届会议于十五、十六两日在布拉格举行。捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统萨波托斯基，总理西罗基，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会、共和国政府各部和人民团体的负责人都参加了会议。各国驻捷外交使团的代表也应邀列席会议。
    十五日会议开幕后，选出了费林格为国民议会的新主席。
    在十五日下午会议上，西罗基总理代表共和国政府作了重要报告。他报告了捷克斯洛伐克人民在第一个五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）期间，在社会主义建设和改造方面所获得的巨大成就，共和国目前所面临的任务和政府决定采取的措施。
    西罗基指出：捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设和改造的任务正在胜利完成中。今年工业生产量已比一九四八年增加了一倍，即将超过资本主义时代捷克斯洛伐克的最高工业水平一倍。今年工业的生产总量将达到扩大后的五年计划所规定的目标（按：原订的五年计划规定，到一九五三年底工业总产量要比一九四八年增加百分之五十七，扩大后的五年计划规定要增加百分之九十八。）。在这次五年计划期间实行的社会主义建设和改造的主要结果，就是今天的捷克斯洛伐克的经济特别是工业生产，已为国家的独立、国家的经济力量和防务打下了牢固的基础。捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级所以能够获得这些伟大成就，是因为它是在共产党的领导下，并和劳动农民结成巩固的联盟；因为它遵循了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的不朽教导。
    西罗基接着总结了苏联的无私援助对这些成就所起的巨大作用，并叙述了五年来劳动人民生活福利增进的情形。他说，今年的社会保险费及其他社会和文化事业费，将达二百二十三亿克朗（捷币），比一九四九年增加百分之八十一。早在一九五二年十二月，捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表会议就曾强调指出，应该保证依照按比例发展的法则来进一步发展经济。共和国政府认为，必须在一九五四年采取有效的措施，使国民经济各部门相互关系的发展符合这一法则。我们最重要的任务首先就是保证重工业原料基地的广泛发展。同样迫切的任务就是大大增加煤和电力的生产。同时，政府将注意保证资本财和消费品、工业和农业的生产发展之间的正确比例关系，保证各生产部门之间建立正确的比例关系。西罗基指出：扩大后的五年计划中某些重工业目标显然已被提得太高了，在这种情况下轻工业和食品工业的增长按照比例来说是被规定得过低了。但是，我国在经济建设和改造方面获得的胜利，已为进一步注意消费品生产的发展和保证居民生活水平的提高创造了条件；重工业的投资率可以减低。
    西罗基在谈到农业方面的成就时指出：目前全国已有半数的村庄建立了统一农业合作社，全国人民在以合作社为基础努力发展农业生产方面，已经获得了重要的成就。但今后重要的任务是：保证农业生产水平的提高。政府将在给农民以广泛援助的基础上，本着加强工农联盟的精神，为不断发展合作社的大规模生产创造经济前提。
    西罗基还论述了国际形势。他表示捷克斯洛伐克人民将继续为和平解决朝鲜问题而努力，并对苏联政府关于和平解决德国问题的建议表示赞同和充分的支持。
    十六日，国民议会继续举行会议，热烈地讨论了西罗基的报告。会议最后一致通过了西罗基总理的报告。
    会议至此宣告闭幕。
