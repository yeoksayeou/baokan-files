The masses in the flood-stricken areas of Shen County, Shandong Province, are carrying out a production and self-salvation movement through mutual aid organizations, actively rushing to harvest crops and replanting late-autumn crops, and have made great achievements.

Some areas of Shen County suffered frost damage in the spring, resulting in reduced wheat production. In the autumn, they suffered from floods again, with some autumn crops submerged and most experiencing reduced yields, resulting in a relatively serious disaster situation. After the disaster, the masses and a small number of grassroots cadres were once emotionally unstable and dispirited, and some even planned to sell their cattle and flee to escape the famine. At this time, the county and district leadership determined that production for disaster relief was the central task at hand, and actively mobilized and led the masses to drain water, rush to harvest, and replant late-autumn crops, launching a movement of organized production for self-salvation. Areas where the work was done well, such as Gaomiao Township in the First District and Yang’erzhuang Township in the Second District, have achieved great results.

After the cadres of Yang’erzhuang Township understood the people's thinking, they first mobilized and comforted the disaster-stricken households, initially stabilizing the people's emotions. Then, they convened a People's Representative Conference, explaining the government's determination and confidence in leading the masses in production and self-salvation, as well as the favorable conditions for production and disaster relief. Through comparing examples, the representatives unanimously recognized that it was necessary to vigorously mobilize the masses to plant late-autumn vegetable crops and carry out production for self-salvation in order to overcome the famine. Based on the situation at the representative meeting, a Mutual Aid and Cooperation Representative Meeting was held to educate on the victory over the famine through organization. After the meeting, the representatives went to mobilize and lead the masses in their groups to specifically calculate the accounts in detail and make famine relief plans. At the same time, the township cadres went deep into the key Yatanli Village to help Li Mingtian's mutual aid team create experience in order to promote others. As a result, under the leadership of Li Mingtian's mutual aid team, Yatanli Village launched a production and self-salvation movement, which drove the entire township. By the beginning of September, the township had more than 110 households planting 48 mu of radishes, more than 30 mu of various vegetables, and planned to plant 37 mu of spinach. In terms of harvesting, 1,700 mu of sorghum had been harvested, and 40 percent of 1,350 mu of millet had been harvested. Gaomiao Township in the First District also launched a production and self-salvation movement by mobilizing the masses to rush to harvest autumn crops and plant famine relief crops through the Zhang Shanyu and Zhang Guiyue mutual aid teams.

Currently, the production and self-salvation movement is gradually expanding among the masses in the disaster-stricken areas of Shen County.

    山东莘县水灾地区群众组织起来生产自救
    山东省莘县遭受水灾地区群众通过互助组织开展生产自救运动，积极抢收庄稼、改种晚秋作物，已作出很大成绩。
    莘县部分地区春季遭受霜灾，麦子减产。秋季又遭受水灾，秋禾一部被淹，大部减产，因之灾情比较严重。灾情发生后，群众和少数基层干部曾一度思想动荡，情绪消沉，有的人还准备把牛卖掉，出去逃荒。就在这时，县区领导方面确定以生产救灾为当前中心任务，积极发动和领导群众排水、抢收、改种晚秋作物，开展了组织起来生产自救的运动。工作做得较好的地区如一区高庙乡、二区杨二庄乡等已获得很大成绩。
    杨二庄乡干部了解了群众思想情况后，首先对受灾户进行动员和慰问，初步稳定了群众情绪，接着便召开人民代表会议，说明政府领导群众生产自救的决心和信心以及生产救灾的有利条件。并通过实例对比，使代表们一致认识到必须大力发动群众种植晚秋蔬菜作物，进行生产自救，才能渡过灾荒。根据代表会议情况，继续召开了互助合作代表会，进行组织起来胜利渡过灾荒的教育。会后，各代表都分头开会动员，领导本组群众具体算细账，订渡荒计划。同时，乡干部深入重点雅谈里村帮助李明田互助组创造经验，以便推动其他。结果，在李明田互助组的带动下，雅谈里全村便展开了生产自救运动。并带动了整个乡。到九月初为止，全乡已有一百一十余户种萝卜四十八亩，各种菜三十多亩，还计划种菠菜三十七亩。在抢收方面，一千七百亩高粱已抢收完毕，一千三百五十亩谷子已抢收了百分之四十。一区的高庙乡也是通过张善雨、张桂月两个互助组发动群众抢收秋季作物、抢种渡荒作物，展开了生产自救运动。
    目前，生产自救运动正在莘县受灾地区群众中逐渐扩展。
