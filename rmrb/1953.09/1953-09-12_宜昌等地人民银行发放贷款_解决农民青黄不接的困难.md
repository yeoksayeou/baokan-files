People's Banks in Yichang and other places issue loans to solve the difficulties of farmers during the lean season

The sub-branches of the People's Bank in the Yichang Special District of Hubei Province have issued loans to help farmers overcome the difficulties of the lean season. For example, the Changyang sub-branch issued 6.32 million yuan in sideline loans in early August, solving the one-month food problem for 314 people. Chenxiang District in Yingshan suffered a severe drought and urgently needed waterwheels to protect the seedlings. However, a few farmers lacked food to hire workers to operate the waterwheels, and there was a phenomenon of selling green seedlings. After discovering this situation, the Chenxiang business office of the People's Bank immediately took loans to the countryside and lent them to households with difficulties in fighting drought. In the three townships of Qiaotou, Yinmiao, and Caihe alone, 43 households were lent 1.92 million yuan, solving their difficulties in drought resistance and production.

Xinhua News Agency: The Jibei District business office of the Jiangdu County People's Bank in Jiangsu Province issued 60 million yuan in living loans before the autumn harvest this year, solving the problem of food shortage for 1,072 farmers in eight townships, and exempting them from the exploitation of usury.

    宜昌等地人民银行发放贷款
    解决农民青黄不接的困难
    湖北省宜昌专区各县人民银行支行，发放贷款帮助农民渡过青黄不接的困难。如长阳支行在八月上旬发放副业贷款六千三百二十万元，解决三百一十四人一个月的口粮。应山陈巷区旱象较重，急需车水保苗。但少数农民雇工车水缺口粮，有卖青苗现象。人民银行陈巷营业所发现这一情况后，立即带款下乡，贷给车水抗旱中的困难户。仅桥头、殷庙、蔡河三个乡，就贷给四十三户一百九十二万元，解决了他们抗旱生产的困难。
