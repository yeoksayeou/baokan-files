    Disaster-stricken Farmers in Laixi County, Yuwang Township, Carefully Plan for Production and Self-Salvation

    A letter from the Communications Group of the Laiyang Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong Province: Yuwang Township in the Fifteenth District of Laixi County experienced continuous rainfall for seven days from July 29th to August 4th. Excessive rainfall led to flooding. After condolences and relief from the local People's Government, the morale of the disaster victims began to stabilize. In order to further promote production and disaster relief work, the township convened a meeting of disaster victim representatives on August 17th to discuss how to carry out production for self-salvation. Some representatives suggested planting late autumn crops and more vegetables (such as radishes; if the land is too wet to plant, sand can be added, nests dug, seeds planted, and then covered with sand). They said: If each person plants three fen of radish greens, with each fen producing 250 jin, the harvest would be 750 jin. The meeting also studied how to level the land and drain waterlogged areas to minimize the reduction in autumn crop yields and strive to plant wheat in a timely manner. In addition, everyone came up with some ways to engage in sideline occupations. Some planned to make tofu, push wheelbarrows, or weave strips, while women planned to make shoes, socks, and weave belts. After careful calculation in all aspects, the representatives said with confidence: "In the past, we engaged in production through unity and mutual assistance, and now we must also unite and help each other to overcome the disaster and get through the famine."

    After the meeting, the representatives conscientiously conveyed the production and self-salvation methods to the disaster victims. The disaster victims generally supported the decisions of the meeting and actively prepared to plant late autumn crops. On August 18th alone, the cooperative sold 450 jin of buckwheat seeds, 21 jin of radish seeds, and 9 jin of turnip seeds. According to a survey in Qianyugezhuang Village, 142.5 mu of waterlogged land in the entire village has been planted with buckwheat, 15 mu has been planted with radishes, and another 133 mu is being prepared for planting soon.

    莱西县于汪乡受灾农民精打细算进行生产自救
    中共山东省莱阳地方委员会办公室通讯组来信：莱西县十五区于汪乡在七月二十九日到八月四日七天内连续降雨，因雨水过多，致酿成水灾。经过当地人民政府的慰问、救济，灾民情绪开始稳定。为了进一步开展生产救灾工作，八月十七日这个乡又召开灾民代表会议，讨论怎样进行生产自救的问题。有些代表提出了应该补种晚秋并多种菜蔬（如因地湿不能种，可挑些沙、扒窝、点种，再盖上沙）。他们说：如果每人种三分萝卜菜，每分产二百五十斤，便可收七百五十斤。会上又研究了如何整地排涝，使秋季作物少减产，并争取适时种上小麦的问题。此外，大家又想出一些办法来搞副业，有的计划作豆腐、推小车，或者编条货，妇女们计划做鞋袜、织带子等。经过各方面的精打细算，代表们有信心地说：“过去是团结互助搞生产，现在还得团结互助救灾渡荒。”
    会后，代表们认真地向灾民传达了生产自救的办法。灾民普遍拥护会议的决定，并积极打谱补种晚秋。八月十八日一天，合作社就卖出荞麦种四百五十斤、萝卜种二十一斤、蔓菁种九斤。据前于格庄调查，全村遭涝的土地已种上荞麦的有一百四十二亩半，种上萝卜的有十五亩，最近准备要种的还有一百三十三亩。
