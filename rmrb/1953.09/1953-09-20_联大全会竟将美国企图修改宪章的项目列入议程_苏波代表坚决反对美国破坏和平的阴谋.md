Xinhua News Agency, September 19th Dispatch from TASS: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the afternoon of September 17th and adopted the General Committee's report on the agenda of the General Assembly and the procedures for the committees to discuss various topics.

    Soviet Representative Malik spoke against including the item aimed at revising the United Nations Charter on the agenda. Malik pointed out that from the speeches of the US representative in the General Committee on September 16th and US Secretary of State Dulles in the plenary meeting on the morning of September 17th, it can be clearly seen that the US insists on including this issue on the agenda with a direct political purpose, namely, to remove the most important principle of the United Nations organization from the UN Charter – the principle of unanimity among the five permanent members of the Security Council. Any attempt to revise the Charter can only worsen international tensions and will not help to ease international relations. Malik emphasized that for anyone who cherishes the interests of international peace and security and sincerely strives for a peaceful settlement of international disputes, the main task now is not to revise the Charter, but to strictly abide by the Charter and not allow it to be undermined. He said that certain countries have repeatedly attempted to undermine the United Nations. Their method is mainly to have the United Nations pass resolutions that violate the basic principles of the Charter and violate the principles and norms of international law. At the first plenary meeting of this session, under great pressure, the General Assembly adopted an illegal decision in violation of the United Nations Charter, preventing the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate status in the United Nations. Under these circumstances, it is obvious that certain countries may use the issue of revising the United Nations Charter to once again undermine the United Nations and undermine the cause of peace and international cooperation.

    Polish Representative Naszkowski and Ukrainian Representative Baranov also spoke against including these items on the agenda.

    US Representative Lodge particularly insisted on including the issue of revising the Charter on the agenda. He insisted that the United States has no definite plan or preconceived notions regarding the issue of revising the Charter.

    Malik replied to Lodge's speech. He pointed out that this statement by the US representative does not conform to the facts.

    Malik also opposed including the so-called issue of the detention of prisoners of war from World War II on the agenda. Malik pointed out that the issue of World War II prisoners of war is not within the jurisdiction of the United Nations according to Article 107 of the United Nations Charter. Those who are engaged in the Cold War have exhausted all their poor tricks in the infamous Cold War, and therefore they have fabricated all kinds of lies about the so-called Soviet detention of World War II prisoners of war. The Soviet Union's work of repatriating prisoners of war from Germany, Japan, and other countries has long been completed. Now someone is trying to have the United Nations General Assembly discuss this issue, only to incite international hostility and hatred.

    Lodge insisted on including this so-called prisoner of war issue on the agenda and made the same old slanderous attacks against the Soviet Union.

    Belarusian Representative Kiselev and Czechoslovak Representative David opposed including this issue on the agenda. Kiselev cited examples to illustrate how the "situations" regarding the so-called Soviet Union's failure to repatriate German, Japanese, and Italian prisoners of war were fabricated. He particularly pointed out that the names of missing and already deceased personnel were deliberately included in the prisoner of war lists.

    The issue of preparing for revising the Charter and the issue of prisoners of war were both included on the agenda of the General Assembly.

    The General Assembly adopted the inclusion of the issue of the treatment of Indian people in the Union of South Africa and the issue of racial conflict caused by the South African government's implementation of the policy of racial segregation on the agenda, and adopted the General Committee's recommendations on assigning various issues on the agenda to the General Assembly's committees and on the closing of this session of the General Assembly on December 8th.

    联大全会竟将美国企图修改宪章的项目列入议程
    苏波代表坚决反对美国破坏和平的阴谋
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社十九日讯：联合国大会九月十七日下午举行全体会议，通过了总务委员会关于大会议程及各委员会讨论各项议题的程序的报告。
    苏联代表马立克发言反对把目的在于修改联合国宪章的项目列入议程。马立克指出，从美国代表九月十六日在总务委员会上的发言和美国国务卿杜勒斯九月十七日上午在全体会议上的发言中，可以清楚地看出，美国坚持把这一问题放进议程，有着直接的政治目的，即从联合国宪章中取消联合国组织最重要的原则——安全理事会五个常任理事国一致的原则。任何修改宪章的企图都只能使国际紧张局势恶化，而不能有助于国际关系的缓和。马立克强调指出，对于任何珍视国际和平与安全的利益并真诚努力谋求和平解决国际争端的人来说，现在的主要任务不是要修改宪章，而是要严格地遵守宪章，不许它遭到破坏。他说，某些国家一再企图破坏联合国。而它们的方法主要是使联合国通过一些违反宪章的基本原则并违反国际法的原则和准则的决议。本届大会就在第一次全体会议上，在一种巨大的压力下通过了一项非法的违反联合国宪章的决定，阻止中华人民共和国取得其联合国的合法地位。在这种情况下，显而易见，某些国家可能利用修改联合国宪章的问题来再一次破坏联合国，破坏和平与国际合作的事业。
    波兰代表纳希科夫斯基和乌克兰代表巴拉诺夫斯基也发言反对把这些项目列入议程。
    美国代表洛奇特别坚持把有关修改宪章的问题列入议程。他硬说对于修改宪章的问题，美国并没有确定的计划，也没有任何先入之见。
    马立克答复洛奇的发言。他指出美国代表这种说法是不符合事实的。
    马立克并反对把所谓拘留第二次世界大战战俘的问题列入议程。马立克指出，第二次世界大战战俘问题根据联合国宪章第一百零七条是不在联合国权限之内的。进行冷战的人已在声名狼藉的冷战中用尽了他们可怜的一切法宝，因此便来捏造种种所谓苏联扣留第二次世界大战战俘的谎言。苏联遣返德、日及其他国家战俘的工作早就结束了。现在有人企图使联合国大会讨论这个问题，只是为了煽动国际间的敌意和憎恨。
    洛奇坚持把这个所谓战俘问题列入议程，并对苏联进行了老一套的诽谤性的攻击。
    白俄罗斯代表基谢列夫和捷克斯洛伐克代表戴维反对把这个问题列入议程。基谢列夫举例说明关于所谓苏联没有遣返德国、日本和意大利战俘的“情况”是怎样捏造出来的。他特别指出，在战俘名单中故意列入失踪和已经阵亡的人员的名字。
    有关为修改宪章作准备的问题及战俘的问题结果都列入了大会议程。
    大会通过把南非联邦印度籍人民待遇问题和由于南非政府实行种族隔离政策而引起的种族冲突问题列入议程，并通过了总务委员会关于把议程中各项问题分配给大会各委员会的建议及关于本届大会在十二月八日闭幕的建议。
