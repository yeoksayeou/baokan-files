Reader's Letters Abstract

    Mongolian Revolutionary Soldier's Family Member Xiruhuala Resolves to Develop Animal Husbandry Production

    Readers Lao Du and Chaganleren from Ulanhot City wrote: Xiruhuala, a Mongolian woman from Jilin Gacha, Balin Right Banner, Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has been repeatedly selected as a model military family member and a model worker due to her active labor.

    When Xiruhuala was one year old, her father was forced to hang himself due to poverty. From the age of seven, she and her brother herded cattle and horses for the herdlords. After the liberation of Inner Mongolia, Chairman Mao's radiance shone on the grasslands, and Xiruhuala became her own master. In 1948, Xiruhuala encouraged her husband, Qiemusileng, to join the People's Liberation Army. She herself actively engaged in production at home. In five years, her family increased from fourteen head of livestock to seventy-one. Because she could select good breeds, pay attention to livestock reproduction, and carefully care for the lambs, the livestock reproduction rate reached 100% last year and this year. Xiruhuala is very concerned about the patriotic movement. She took the lead in making donations, making military shoes and socks, supporting the front lines, and actively participating in the propaganda work for suppressing counter-revolutionaries. She did not accept special treatment from others, and even gave pasture to military family members in need. In 1950, Xiruhuala was elected as the Director of the Women's Federation of Jilin Gacha; in 1952, she joined the Communist Youth League; this year she joined the glorious Communist Party. In the past two years, Xiruhuala has been repeatedly selected as a model military family member and a model animal husbandry worker. But she is not proud at all. She said: I will work hard to develop animal husbandry production on our grassland to support the industrial construction of the motherland.

    蒙族革命军人家属希如花拉决心发展牧业生产
    乌兰浩特市读者老杜、查干乐人来信：内蒙古自治区昭乌达盟巴林右翼旗吉林嘎查的蒙族妇女希如花拉由于积极劳动，几次被选为军属模范和劳动模范。
    希如花拉一岁时，父亲被生活逼迫上吊死了，从七岁起她便和哥哥一起给牧主放牛马。内蒙古解放了，毛主席的光辉照到草原上，希如花拉才翻身作了主人。一九四八年，希如花拉鼓励丈夫切木斯冷参加了解放军。她自己在家积极生产。五年工夫，她家从十四头牲畜增加到七十一头。由于她能选择好种，注意牲畜的繁殖，细心地爱惜小羔，去年和今年的牲畜繁殖率都达到百分之百。希如花拉对爱国运动很关心。她曾带头捐献，做军鞋军袜，支援前线，积极参加镇压反革命的宣传工作。她不用别人的优待，还拿出牧草送给有困难的军属。一九五○年希如花拉被选为吉林嘎查妇联主任；一九五二年她参加了青年团；今年她参加了光荣的共产党。两年来，希如花拉几次被选为军属模范和牧业劳动模范。但她毫不骄傲。她说：我要好好发展我们草原上的牧业生产，支援祖国的工业建设。
