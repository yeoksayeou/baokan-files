    "A Peculiar Attitude Towards People"
    Xiang Zhen
    On August 16th, the Xin River in Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province, swelled dramatically. In the evening, a worker rescuing state timber was trapped on a sandbar in the river. The wind and rain were heavy at the time, and the river was constantly rising, threatening to submerge the sandbar; the worker's situation was very dangerous.

    Those of us on the shore noticed a small motorboat docked by the river and immediately consulted with the people on board, requesting them to sail out and rescue the worker. After we managed to find the missing battery, gasoline, and a driver for the boat, and after Wang Dexiu, chairman of the Shangrao City Federation of Trade Unions, offered to be responsible for the consequences of sailing the boat, the people on the boat went to the Jiangxi Provincial Transportation Company's Engineering Section to ask for instructions. They returned and said, "We cannot sail the boat without a slip from the Engineering Section. These are the instructions from above!"

    Therefore, we had to brave the heavy rain and rush to the company's Engineering Section to negotiate. A comrade named Wang Mingzhang (said to be the deputy section chief of the Engineering Section) received us and gave many "reasons" why the boat could not be used. After we repeatedly explained the situation, he then demanded someone guarantee that the motorboat would not be damaged. So, Comrade Wang Dexiu wrote a guarantee in the name of the Chairman of the Shangrao City Federation of Trade Unions, and only then did he slowly write a slip authorizing the boat to sail.

    To rescue this worker who was trapped in the river while rescuing state property, more than ten of us negotiated with the Jiangxi Provincial Transportation Company's Engineering Section from a little after six o'clock in the evening until about half past eleven at night, spending a full five and a half hours dealing with "formalities." Fortunately, the water level did not continue to rise later, and the life of this worker comrade was rescued.

    Wang Mingzhang of the Jiangxi Provincial Transportation Company's Engineering Section emphasized "procedures" and "responsibility" so mechanically, while showing such indifference to rescuing a life; this is precisely the kind of "peculiar attitude towards people" that Comrade Stalin pointed out. Compared with the heroic deeds of Martyr Luo Shengjiao and others, this attitude makes one feel intensely how disgraceful it is!

    “奇异的对人态度”
    向真
    八月十六日，江西省上饶市的信江江水暴涨。傍晚时，有一个抢救国家木材的工人被困在江中的一个沙墩上。当时风雨很大，江水不断上涨，沙墩会被水吞没；这位工人的处境很危险。
    我们在岸上的人发现江边停有一只小汽船，就马上和船上的人商量，请求开船去抢救。经我们设法找到了船上所缺的电瓶、汽油和一个会驾驶的人，并由上饶市总工会主席王德修提出愿对开船后果负责后，船上的人就跑到江西省运输公司工务段去请示。他们回来后说：“没有接到工务段的条子，不能随便开船。这是上级指示！”
    于是，我们只好冒着大雨赶到该公司的工务段去接洽。一位名叫王铭章的同志（据说是工务段副段长）接待我们，讲了很多“道理”，说是船不能开。经我们再三说明情况，他又提出要有人保证汽船不受损坏。于是，王德修同志就以上饶市总工会主席的名义写了张保条，他才慢吞吞地写了张通知开船的条子。
    为了搭救这位因抢救国家资财而被困在江中的工人，我们十多个人从傍晚六点多钟起和江西省运输公司工务段一直交涉到晚十一点半左右，足足办了五个多钟头的“手续”。幸亏后来水位没有继续上升，这位工人同志的生命才被抢救出来。
    江西省运输公司工务段王铭章这样机械地强调“手续”、“责任”，而对抢救人命却表现得那样淡漠；正是斯大林同志指出的那种“奇异的对人态度”。和罗盛教烈士等的英雄事迹对比，这种态度使人强烈地感到是多么可耻！
