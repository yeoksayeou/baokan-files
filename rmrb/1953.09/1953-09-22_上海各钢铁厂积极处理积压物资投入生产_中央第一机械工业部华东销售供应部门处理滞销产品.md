Shanghai's state-owned and joint state-private steel plants have put 600 to 700 billion yuan worth of backlogged materials into production, saving the country a lot of money.

The Shanghai Steel Company's First, Second, and Third Plants had many backlogged steel ingots and steel billets, which have now been rolled into steel. The First Plant used to have 1,000 tons of steel ingots that were backlogged due to poor surface conditions. After inspection this time, with the technical assistance of the New Shanghai Steel Plant, more than 80 percent of the steel ingots met the specifications and became good steel. Many defective flat steel, round steel, and wire rods that were backlogged in the past have recently been bought by cooperatives in Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian and other places to make agricultural implements for farmers. Some steel ingots, scrap steel, etc., have been returned to the furnace by the factories as raw materials for steelmaking. A diesel generator set with a large power generation capacity that had been backlogged for more than three years in the Second Plant of Shanghai Steel Company has now been transferred to a mining area of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government for use.

The handling of these backlogged materials has greatly accelerated the turnover of funds in the factories. The Third Plant of Shanghai Steel Company had some difficulties in fund scheduling in the first half of this year due to some unusable materials backlogged in the newly built and expanded sand casting workshop, gas generator, workers' dormitory, and other projects. After the plant handled these materials, these difficulties were immediately resolved. At present, the plant is preparing to use some of its working capital for automation measures in the steel rolling workshop's steel baking furnace. The New Shanghai Steel Plant has stopped the backlog of finished products due to finding sales for finished wheels, and has paid off part of the profits that were not completed in the first half of the year. The Second Plant of Shanghai Steel Company estimates that after all the backlogged materials are processed, the funds that can be turned into cash will be equivalent to all the funds needed for the steel window material workshop that the plant is about to build.

In the past few years, Shanghai's steel plants have backlogged many steel ingots, steel, steel castings, as well as various raw materials and equipment. Among these materials, some are defective products and waste products from the production of various factories in the past few years, and some are finished products that have not been sold in time; there are also some that have been left over from the period of the enemy and puppets and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Since April and May of this year, the factories have begun to handle these backlogged materials. In the process of handling these materials, the supply and marketing, finance, and technical supervision departments of the factories have classified and studied various backlogged materials, and re-examined and analyzed the quality. The East China Steel Company and its affiliated factories have actively contacted other relevant departments to find sales channels for materials. (Xinhua News Agency)

The East China Sales Office of the Sales Bureau and the East China Supply Office of the Supply Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building actively handled slow-moving products and backlogged materials, and have found sales channels for materials worth 17.5 billion yuan that were piled up in warehouses. The East China Sales Office and the Supply Office both designated special personnel to do this work in July and August of this year; the Supply Office also established a Materials Processing Committee. In order to promote the sale of backlogged products, the Sales Office has sent more than 900 letters to state-owned enterprises across the country seeking customers. Old-fashioned small steam power generation equipment and gas engines, cultural machines, cement mixers and other products that were originally thought to be unsalable have now found some buyers. A set of steam power generation equipment will soon be installed and generate electricity in Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, and four gas engines will be transported to the grain processing departments in Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, for production. After the eight members of the Materials Processing Group of the Supply Office visited more than 40 state-owned factories and basic construction units in Shanghai, they also supplied 150 tons of bamboo steel, wire rod, lead wire and other materials to construction departments such as the East China Construction Engineering Company. In addition, more than 1,000 tons of medium carbon steel billets were put into the production of steel rolling mills under the East China Steel Company. In addition, a batch of small tools, electric fans, electric refrigerators, flushing toilets and other materials with various specifications have been promoted by holding exhibitions, and many of them have sales targets. The achievements made in actively handling slow-moving products and backlogged materials have increased the confidence of the staff of the two offices. They have now formulated a plan to further expand sales work, and strive to revive 280 billion yuan of funds for the country by the end of the year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海各钢铁厂积极处理积压物资投入生产
    中央第一机械工业部华东销售供应部门处理滞销产品
    上海市各国营和公私合营钢铁厂把清理出来的价值六、七百亿元的积压物资，运用到生产中去，为国家节省了许多资金。
    上海钢铁公司第一厂、第二厂和第三厂，有许多积压的钢锭、钢胚，现在已被轧成了钢材。第一厂过去有一千吨钢锭，因为表面情况不好被积压下来，这次经过检验，又得到新沪钢铁厂技术上的帮助，结果有百分之八十以上的钢锭都合乎规格，变成了好的钢材。过去积压的许多扁钢、圆钢、盘元中的次品，最近已由山东、江苏、福建等地的合作社买了去，给农民制造农具。有些钢锭、废钢材等，已被各厂重新回炉做了炼钢原料。上海钢铁公司第二厂积压了三年多的一套发电能力很大的柴油发电机，现在调到中央人民政府重工业部一个矿区去用。
    这些积压物资的处理，大大加速了各厂资金的流转。上海钢铁公司第三厂在新建和扩建的翻砂车间、煤气发生炉、工人宿舍等工程中，由于积压了一部分不能使用的物资，今年上半年曾一度发生资金调度上的困难。该厂在处理了这些物资以后，这些困难就立刻得到解决。目前该厂准备把一部分机动资金，用到轧钢车间烘钢炉的自动化等措施上去。新沪钢铁厂由于找到了车轮成品的销售，成品积压现象已经停止，并缴清了上半年未完成的一部分上缴利润。上海钢铁公司第二厂估计全部积压物资处理完毕后，可以变活的资金，相等于该厂即将新建的钢窗料车间所需要的全部款项。
    上海各钢铁厂过去几年来积压了许多钢锭、钢材、钢铁铸件以及各种原材料和设备器材。这些物资中，有的是几年来各厂生产中的次品、废品和一些没有及时销出的成品；还有的是从敌伪时期和国民党反动派时期就积留下来的。今年四、五月份以来，各厂开始处理这些积压物资。在处理过程中，各厂的供销、财务、技术监督等部门，对各种积压物资作了分类和研究，并对质量情况重新做了检验、分析。华东钢铁公司及所属各厂，都积极和其他有关部门联系，找寻物资销路。　（新华社）
    第一机械工业部所属销售局华东销售办事处和供应局华东供应办事处积极处理滞销产品和积压材料，已使价值一百七十五亿元压在仓库里的物资找到了销路。华东销售办事处和供应办事处在今年七、八月间都曾指定专人做这项工作；供应办事处还成立了物资处理委员会。销售办事处为推销积压产品，先后向全国各地国营企业部门发出了九百多封征求顾主的信件。原来认为找不到销路的老式小型蒸汽发电设备和煤气机、文化机、水泥搅拌机等产品，现在已有一部分找到了买主。有一套蒸气发电设备很快就要在山西省长治县安装发电，四部煤气机也就将运到四川省成都市粮食加工部门投入生产。供应办事处物资处理小组的八个人员在分头访问了上海四十多个国营工厂和基本建设单位后，也使一百五十吨的竹节钢、盘元、铅丝等材料供应了华东建筑工程公司等建筑部门。另有一千多吨的中炭钢胚投入了华东钢铁公司所属轧钢厂的生产。此外，一批零星而规格繁多的小工具、电风扇、电气冰箱、抽水马桶等物资，因用举办展览会的办法进行推销，也有很多有了销售对象。积极处理滞销产品和积压材料取得的成绩，提高了这两个办事处工作人员的信心，他们现已拟定了进一步开展推销工作的计划，争取在年底为国家复活二千八百亿元的资金。（新华社）
