Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 9th—Saigon dispatch: As preliminary contacts are being made in negotiations between the Vietnamese puppet group of Bảo Đại and the French government regarding allowing Bảo Đại “independence”, the so-called “nationalists” of the Bảo Đại group, instigated by the United States, are stepping up pressure on France.

On September 4th, Bảo Đại's Prime Minister Nguyễn Văn Tâm flew to Paris to find Bảo Đại in order to gather representatives of various reactionary groups to participate in formal negotiations with France. On the very day that Nguyễn Văn Tâm flew to Paris, according to the Associated Press, Bảo Đại's "Chairman" of North Vietnam, Nguyễn Hữu Trí, organized a "spontaneous" anti-French demonstration in Hanoi, demanding "independence." Then, on the following day, the heads of five reactionary religions in South Vietnam, in the name of groups participating in the "Nationalist Congress," jointly issued a statement fiercely demanding "complete independence" from France. This statement demanded that Bảo Đại, like the Cambodian puppet King Sihanouk under the instigation of the United States, use "drastic measures" to force France to concede.

France is exceptionally annoyed by these actions that deviate from France. Agence France-Presse pointed out with dissatisfaction that this "fierce" statement on Vietnamese "independence" aims to "exert pressure on France."

At the same time, news from Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, indicates that negotiations between France and the Cambodian puppet group are not progressing smoothly. France fears that the concessions made to Cambodia will weaken its position in Cambodia, and also fears that these concessions will in turn affect Bảo Đại's demand for more concessions in the French-Vietnamese negotiations. Therefore, after France and Cambodia reached an agreement on the "transfer" of judicial and police powers at the end of August, the negotiations were deadlocked because Cambodia insisted that all French troops must withdraw from Cambodian territory. Negotiations were suspended for a week and resumed on September 5th. According to a message from Phnom Penh by the Associated Press on the same day, at the meeting on the 5th, France had agreed to "transfer" five battalions of Cambodian puppet troops from the French army to Cambodia; Cambodia also allowed North African troops in the French army to remain stationed on the east bank of the Mekong River within Cambodian territory. However, the meeting on the same day "did not reach a final agreement on all issues."

    亟图把法国从印度支那挤出去
    美国策动保大向法国施行压力
    【新华社九日讯】西贡消息：在越南保大傀儡集团和法国政府间关于允许保大“独立”的谈判正在初步接触的时候，美国策动保大集团的所谓“民族主义者”加紧向法国施行压力。
    九月四日，保大内阁总理阮文心为了搜罗各反动集团的代表人物参加和法国进行的正式谈判，曾飞到巴黎去找保大。恰恰在阮文心飞到巴黎的当天，据合众社报道，保大的北越“主席”阮友智就在河内组织了一次“自发”的反法示威，要求“独立”。接着在第二天，南越的五个反动宗教头子又以参加“民族主义者大会”的团体的名义，联名发表声明，激烈要求从法国手里取得“完全的独立”。这个声明要求保大要像在美国唆使之下的高棉傀儡国王西哈努克一样“用激烈的手段”来迫使法国让步。
    法国对这些背离法国的行动感到异常烦恼。法新社不满地指出，这个“激烈”的关于越南“独立”的声明，目的在“向法国施行压力”。
    同时，从高棉首都金边传来的消息表明：法国和高棉傀儡集团间的谈判进行得并不顺利。法国害怕对高棉所做的让步要削弱它在高棉的地位，同时又怕这些让步也会转而影响保大在法越谈判中提出更多的要求。所以在八月底法国和高棉就“移交”司法和警察权力方面达成协议以后，谈判曾因高棉坚持法军必须全部从高棉领土撤退而陷于僵局。谈判停顿了一星期后，在九月五日复会。据美联社当天从金边发出的消息说：在五日的会议上，法国已经答应将法军中的五营高棉伪军“移交”给高棉；高棉也允许法国军队中的北非部队留驻在高棉境内的湄公河东岸。但是，当天会议“没有就一切问题达成最后协议”。
