    My Understanding of Teaching Reform in Higher Industrial Schools
    —Gains from Attending the National Administrative Conference of Higher Industrial Schools
    Zhang Guofan, Vice President of Tianjin University

    The Characteristics of New-Type Higher Industrial Education
    The recently concluded National Administrative Conference of Higher Industrial Schools further discussed the nature of teaching reform, providing everyone with a clearer understanding. However, this understanding is still principled and not specific enough, and specific understanding is extremely important to us. Here, I would like to attempt to raise a specific issue for discussion, in order to more deeply understand the nature of teaching reform. This issue is: what exactly are the characteristics of new-type higher education, that is, higher education led by the ideology of the working class?
    I believe the first characteristic is its political ideological nature. Education is a superstructure, and it must change with the transformation of the socio-economic system. Education that is divorced from reality and politics does not exist. We are in a New Democratic society, and our higher education must be guided by Marxism-Leninism. The talents cultivated by our universities should not only possess specialized technology but also a dialectical materialist worldview. Only such talents can meet the needs of national construction. The second characteristic is having clear purpose and planning. Since higher education serves a specific political economy, the arrangement of departments and faculties, the setting of specializations, the teaching plan, and even the content of textbooks and teaching methods must all adapt to this task. In order to effectively carry out its tasks, all teaching activities of the school must be conducted in a planned and step-by-step manner, and not haphazardly. This shows that correctly formulating and implementing the teaching plan is a top priority in the new-type universities. The third characteristic is the unity of theory and practice. Adapting to this characteristic, the teaching plan of new-type universities not only stipulates that students should lay a solid theoretical foundation in school, but also stipulates that students should conduct many experiments and internships. Students cultivated in this way are not merely "generalists" who can only talk on paper, but national construction talents who can assume certain responsibilities in production posts. The fourth characteristic is its collectivity. The relevant parties must cooperate and coordinate, each contributing their best efforts, in order to run the higher education cause well. Within the school, all teachers must be organized. From formulating teaching plans, writing textbooks, to researching teaching methods, guiding students' self-study, and conducting scientific research work, all must be carried out in an organized manner. Outside the school, the cooperation between schools and factories and mines, and the connection with scientific research departments, are essential for students' production internships and teachers' professional improvement. Factories, mines, and scientific research departments must vigorously assist universities and see higher education as a part of their own cause.
    I believe that the above four points are the main characteristics of new-type higher education, that is, higher education led by the ideology of the working class. Conversely, the old higher education, led by bourgeois ideology, is exactly the opposite. It is so-called "supra-political," without purpose or plan, divorced from theory and practice, and individualistic. It can be seen from this that to transform the old universities into new-type universities through teaching reform is indeed a very arduous task.

    On Learning from the Soviet Union
    In the past year, China's higher education has achieved considerable success in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reform. Experience has proven that correctly applying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is the only way for teaching reform. The problem lies in how to be considered "correctly applying." We say "learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union must be combined with China's actual conditions," "learning the spirit and essence of the Soviet experience," and "not learning in form." These formulations are all good, but they are still not concrete enough. How to turn these principles into concrete practical guidelines is not an easy task. For example, we ask: What is the essence of Soviet higher education, and what is its form? We should certainly study its essence conscientiously, but can the formal part be changed at will? These issues are worthy of study. According to my personal experience, the spirit of Soviet higher education is manifested in the high degree of Marxist-Leninist ideology, the completeness of the scientific system, purposefulness, planning, organization, and the unity of theory and practice. We must learn these spirits. However, we cannot mechanically transplant the current standards of Soviet higher education, because we do not currently have the same conditions as the Soviet Union. Speaking of form, those are also some of the best forms found by the Soviet Union through more than 30 years of experience. Such as the organization of the teaching research and guidance office, and the division of teaching into five components—theoretical teaching, production internship, course design and graduation thesis design, examinations, and holidays—so that each part has a certain arrangement. These organizational forms are necessary to complete the teaching task, and we cannot easily change them when learning from the Soviet experience. Some of them can be slowed down or lowered in standards due to insufficient conditions, such as graduation thesis design, but we must recognize that this deficiency must be made up for in the future. But some systems are only determined based on the Soviet situation: such as the length of study for a certain major being three, four, or five years, which is mainly determined based on the level of science and technology and production in the Soviet Union, as well as the urgency of the state's need for talents. Our situation is different, so there is no need to copy them.

    The Path to Training Engineers
    At this conference, there was much debate on the training goals of the four-year undergraduate program. It was finally determined that the undergraduate program should in principle train engineers who are adapted to China's actual conditions and level of science and technology (it is the title of the graduates, not the position). That is to say, the four-year undergraduate program of higher industrial schools is to train talents who can become engineers in the future. Therefore, students must at least be given some basic training as engineers in school. What knowledge and basic training should a future engineer have? The Soviet teaching plan stipulates that as a creative engineer, one should have knowledge in five areas: (1) Basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism; (2) Theoretical knowledge of general natural sciences; (3) General technical basic knowledge; (4) Enterprise economics and knowledge of worker, factory safety and fire prevention; (5) Professional knowledge. I believe that knowledge and training in these five areas are all necessary and indispensable. However, the study period in our universities is generally only four years, one year less than in the Soviet Union. We certainly cannot demand that we meet the current standards of the Soviet Union, but we cannot simply reduce it by 20% across the board. On the one hand, we must reduce class hours, and on the other hand, we must ensure a certain quality. Solving the contradiction between these two is the first problem we should solve when formulating the teaching plan.
    Tianjin University has taken the following measures to solve this problem. From a general point of view, we believe that basic theoretical training is particularly important for a future engineer in school (this does not mean that professional training can be ignored), because basic theory is the foundation of professional knowledge. This is the first point. The development of basic theory is relatively slow and can be applied for a long time. The development of professional technology is relatively fast, and what is learned in school may change when one gets to the job. Therefore, professional and technical knowledge can and must be gradually increased on the job. This is the second point. Therefore, the number of class hours for basic theory courses has been reduced less in the newly revised teaching plan of Tianjin University. Secondly, in order to ensure that the cadres trained do have specialized knowledge, our standards cannot be lowered too much compared with the Soviet standards, otherwise there will be no so-called specialization (of course, it is impossible not to lower it under the current conditions). Therefore, the main way out is to reduce the requirements for professional training. This can be done in different ways for different majors. One is to reduce the specialization of the major, so that those courses that prepare for the abandoned specialization can be omitted or learned less. For example, the fuel chemical industry major, according to the Soviet plan, has three specializations: "Coking and Coking Products," "Artificial Liquid Fuels," and "Gasification." Because we only engage in one specialization, "Coking," we can learn less or not learn "Colloid Chemistry" and "Gasification" in industrial chemistry, which are mainly prepared for the other two specializations. Talents trained in this way are still very specialized in coking, although knowledge in the other two aspects is limited. For majors in the Soviet teaching plan that do not have specialization, similar methods are adopted to narrow the breadth of the major, or focus on design, or focus on construction, or focus on one aspect of the manufacturing process. As for how to determine the specifics, it is of course necessary to refer to the needs of the business department and consider the conditions of the faculty. Talents trained in this way have a sufficient theoretical basis on the one hand, and a certain specialty on the other hand, and the number of class hours borne during the learning period is not too heavy. Comparing the recently revised teaching plan of Tianjin University with the Soviet teaching plan, it can be seen that the engineers we train in four years can guarantee a certain quality.

    The Issue of Combining Needs and Possibilities
    The correct combination of needs and possibilities is the key to steadily carrying out teaching reform in universities. In the past, the requirements were too high and too hasty, "taking care of needs more and considering possibilities less," which was due to the failure to combine needs and possibilities well. Because of the tight production tasks, the industrial departments are in urgent need of cadres, so they require schools to "be fast, be many, and be good" in training cadres; but they do not consider the specific conditions of the schools and the complexity and arduousness of training senior technical cadres. Within the school, merely because of the temporary enthusiasm of teachers and students, unrealistically high requirements are often put forward. For example, seeing that Tsinghua University has made a sudden advance in learning Russian, regardless of the school's faculty conditions, it is also required to make a sudden advance in learning Russian; seeing that Soviet experts at Harbin Institute of Technology offer a certain course, this department also wants to offer the same course. It is good to learn from advanced schools. But regardless of the conditions, simply imitating and always "looking at the mountain high" will lead to a tendency to demand too high and too hastily. This is one aspect. On the other hand, if we do not consider the needs of national construction, and only emphasize difficulties, be content with existing conditions, and do not actively create new conditions, we will fall far behind the needs. To properly combine needs and possibilities, we must consider the possibility as much as possible when putting forward needs; when considering the possibility, we should also consider the needs as much as possible. Such considerations are not one-sided. At the same time, we must also see that both needs and possibilities will develop; what can meet today's needs may not be able to meet tomorrow's needs; what is impossible today will become possible tomorrow with subjective efforts; what cannot be achieved by one person's efforts or one school's efforts may be achieved by the joint efforts of all schools. In short, problems must be viewed from a comprehensive, developmental, and specific condition perspective in order for needs and possibilities to be correctly combined.

    The Key to Improving Teaching Quality
    No matter how excellent the teaching organization, teaching content, teaching methods, and teaching system are, if there are no excellent teachers to master and apply them, they will still not be able to play their role. Therefore, improving the quality of teachers is a prerequisite for improving teaching quality. And the quality of teachers depends on their level of Marxism-Leninism and their level of science and technology. Making the thought of Marxism-Leninism and a high level of science combine in concrete teaching activities is the central issue of teaching reform and the primary task of university leaders. Therefore, on the one hand, we must lead teachers to study Marxism-Leninism in depth and systematically, and on the other hand, we must guide teachers to carry out scientific research work. Only by constantly expanding one's field of knowledge under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, constantly enriching one's knowledge with new achievements in science, in factories, in laboratories, in the jungle of complex scientific problems, and in arduous research work, is "improving the quality of teachers" in the full sense. Therefore, combining the study of Marxism-Leninism with scientific research work is the key to improving teaching quality. This work can only be done well and not badly.

    我对高等工业学校教学改革的几点认识
    ——参加全国高等工业学校行政会议的收获
    天津大学副校长  张国藩
    新型高等工业教育的特点
    不久以前召开的全国高等工业学校行政会议，对教学改革的性质作了进一步的讨论，使大家有了更清楚的认识。但是这种认识还是原则性的，不够具体的，而具体的认识，对于我们却是十分重要的。这里我想试图提出一个具体问题来加以探讨，借以更深刻地认识教学改革的性质。这个问题就是：新型的，即工人阶级思想领导的高等教育，其特点究竟是什么呢？
    我认为，第一个特点就是它的政治思想性。教育是上层建筑，它必须随着社会经济制度的变革而变革。脱离现实，脱离政治的教育是不存在的。我们处在新民主主义社会，我们的高等教育必须以马克思列宁主义为指导原则。我们的高等学校所培养的人材，不仅应该具有专门技术，而且应该具有辩证唯物主义的世界观。只有这样的人材，才能适应国家建设的需要。第二个特点是有明确的目的性和计划性。高等教育既然是为一定的政治经济服务的，那末，院系的安排、专业设置、教学计划以至教材内容、教学方法都必须适应这个任务。为了有效地执行自己的任务，学校的一切教学活动必须有计划、有步骤地进行，而不能是杂乱无章的。这说明正确地拟定和执行教学计划，在新型的高等学校，是一项头等重要的工作。第三个特点就是理论和实际的一致性。适应这个特点，新型高等学校的教学计划，不但规定学生要在学校里打下深厚的理论基础，也规定了学生要作很多次的实验和实习。这样培养出来的学生才不是仅能纸上谈兵的“通才”，而是能够在生产岗位上担当一定责任的国家建设人材。第四个特点就是它的集体性，有关的各个方面必须配合协调，各尽其力，高等教育事业才能办好。在校内，所有教师都要组织起来。从制订教学计划、编写教材到研究教学方法、指导学生自学、进行科学研究工作等，都要有组织地来进行。在校外，学校和厂矿的合作，和科学研究部门的联系，是对学生的生产实习和教师的业务提高必不可少的。必须使厂矿和科学研究部门大力协助高等学校，把高等教育看成是他们本身事业的一部分。
    我认为以上四点就是新型的、也就是工人阶级思想领导的高等教育的主要特点。反之，旧的、为资产阶级思想所领导的高等教育则恰恰与之相反。它是所谓“超政治”的、无目的无计划的、理论脱离实际的、个人主义的。由此可见，要使旧的高等学校，经过教学改革，变成新型的高等学校，确实是十分艰巨的工作。
    关于学习苏联
    一年以来，我国高等教育在学习苏联先进经验进行教学改革方面已经取得了相当大的成绩。经验证明，正确地运用苏联先进经验是教学改革唯一的道路，问题就在于如何才算是“正确地运用”。我们说“学习苏联先进经验要和中国实际情况相结合”，“要学习苏联经验的精神和实质”，“不要形式地学”，这些提法都是很好的，但是还嫌不够具体。如何能把这些原则变为具体实践的指针，不是一件很容易的事情。例如我们问：什么是苏联高等教育的实质，什么又是它的形式呢？它的实质我们固然应该认真学习，而它的形式部分是不是就可以随便变动呢？这些问题都是值得研究的。据我个人的体会，苏联高等教育的精神表现在高度的马克思列宁主义思想性，科学体系的完整性，目的性，计划性和组织性，理论和实际的一致性等方面。这些精神我们必须学习。但是苏联高等教育的现行标准，我们就不能生硬地搬来，因为我们目前还没有苏联那样的条件。说到形式，那也是苏联三十多年的经验所找出来的一些最好的形式。如教学研究指导室的组织，又如把教学分为五个组成部分——理论教学，生产实习，课程设计和毕业论文设计，考试，假期，使每一部分有一定的安排等。这些组织形式都是为完成教学任务所必需的，我们在学习苏联经验的时候，就不可以轻易变动。其中有的因为我们条件不足，如毕业论文设计，虽然可以缓作，或者降低一些标准，但这一缺欠，我们必须认定是要在以后弥补起来的。但有的制度只是针对苏联情况而定的：如某专业的修业年限三年、四年或五年，主要是根据苏联的科学技术和生产水平以及国家需要人材的缓急而确定的。我们的情况不一样，就不必照抄。
    培养工程师的道路
    在这次会议上大家对四年制本科的培养目标有不少争论，最后确定本科原则上是培养适应中国实际情况和科学技术水平的工程师（是毕业生的称号而不是职位）。这就是说，高等工业学校四年制的本科是要培养出将来能作工程师的人材的，因此在学校里至少就要给学生作工程师的一些基本训练。一个未来的工程师应该具有那些知识和基本训练呢？苏联的教学计划规定，作为一个具有创造性的工程师，应该具有五方面的知识：（一）马克思列宁主义的基础知识；（二）一般自然科学的理论知识；（三）一般技术基础知识；（四）企业经济和工人、工厂的安全和防火知识；（五）专业知识。这五方面的知识和训练，我认为都是必要的，缺一不可的。但是我们高等学校的学习期限一般只有四年，比苏联少一年，我们当然不能要求达到苏联的现行标准，但也不能平均地打一个八折。我们一方面要削减时数，一方面又要保证一定的质量，解决这两者的矛盾，就是我们在拟订教学计划时所当首先解决的问题。
    天津大学是采取下面的措施来解决这个问题的。从总的方面说，我们认为一个未来的工程师，在学校的基本理论训练尤为重要（这不等于可以忽视专业训练），因为基本理论是专业知识的基础。这是第一点。基本理论的发展是比较缓慢的，可以在很长的时期之内应用，专业技术的发展则是比较快的，在校所学的东西，到工作岗位就可能有所改变。所以专业技术知识是可以而且必须到工作岗位上逐渐增加的。这是第二点。所以在天津大学新修订的教学计划中，基本理论课程的时数就比较削减得少。其次，要使培养出来的干部确实具有专门知识，我们的标准就不能比苏联的标准降低太多，否则就无所谓专（当然，在目前条件下，不降低是不可能的）。所以主要出路，在减少对专业训练的要求。这可以针对不同的专业，采取不同的办法。一是减少专业的专门化，这样，那些为放弃了的专门化作准备的课程就可以不学或者少学。例如燃料化工专业，按照苏联的计划有“炼焦与炼焦产品”、“人造液体燃料”和“气化”三个专门化，因为我们只搞“炼焦”一个专门化，对主要为其他两个专门化作准备的“胶体化学”和工业化学中的“气化”等部分，就可以少学或者不学。这样培养出来的人材，对炼焦方面还是很专的，虽然在其他两方面的知识，有所限制。对苏联教学计划中没有专门化的专业，也采取类似办法，缩小专业的广度，或者专重设计，或者专重施工，或者专重制造程序的某一方面。至于如何具体确定，当然要参照业务部门的需要并考虑到师资条件。这样培养出来的人材，一方面有足够的理论基础，一方面也有一定的专长，而在学习期间所负担的学时并不太重。以天津大学最近修订的教学计划和苏联的教学计划相比较，可以看出我们用四年的时间训练出的工程师是可以保证一定的质量的。
    需要和可能互相结合的问题
    需要和可能的正确结合，是稳步进行高等学校教学改革的关键。过去要求过高过急，“照顾需要多、考虑可能少”，就是由于没有把需要和可能很好地结合起来。工业部门因为生产任务紧，需要干部就急，因此要求学校在培养干部方面要“又快、又多、又好”；而对学校的具体条件，和培养高级技术干部的复杂性和艰巨性，考虑得很不够。在学校内，仅仅由于师生一时的热情，也常常提出脱离实际的过高的要求。例如，看见清华大学突击学习了俄文，不管学校师资条件如何，也要求照样地突击学习俄文；看见哈尔滨工业大学苏联专家开有某某课程，也要本系开同一门课程。向先进学校学习，原是好的。但不顾条件，只是一味模仿，永远“望见那山高”，这就会造成要求过高过急的偏向。这是一方面。另一方面，若不考虑国家建设的需要，一味强调困难，安于现成的条件，不积极创造新的条件，则又会远远落在需要的后面。要使需要和可能适当地结合，必须在提出需要的时候，尽先考虑可能性；在考虑可能性的时候，也应尽量考虑到需要。这样的考虑才不是片面的。同时也要看到需要和可能都是会发展的；能满足今天的需要，不见得能满足明天的需要；今天不可能的，加上主观的努力，明天就会变为可能；一个人的努力、或一个学校的努力不能达到的，各校的共同努力或者就能达到。总之，必须从全面，从发展，从具体条件出发来看问题，需要和可能才可以正确地结合起来。
    提高教学质量的关键
    不论教学组织、教学内容、教学方法、教学制度怎样优良，如果没有优秀的教师去掌握和运用，那仍然是不能发挥它们的作用的。所以，提高教师的质量，是提高教学质量的先决条件。而教师的质量决定于他们的马克思列宁主义水平和科学技术水平。使马克思列宁主义思想和高度的科学水平在具体教学活动中结合起来，就是教学改革的中心问题，也是高等学校领导工作者的首要任务。因此，一方面要领导教师们深入地、系统地学习马克思列宁主义，另一方面，必须引导教师们进行科学研究工作。只有在马克思列宁主义指导下，经常在工厂、在实验室、在复杂的科学问题的丛林中、在艰苦的研究工作中不断扩展自己的知识的领域，不断以科学上的新的成就来丰富自己的知识，才是完全意义上的“提高教师质量”。所以，把学习马克思列宁主义和科学研究工作结合起来，是提高教学质量的关键。这个工作，是只许做好不许做坏的。
