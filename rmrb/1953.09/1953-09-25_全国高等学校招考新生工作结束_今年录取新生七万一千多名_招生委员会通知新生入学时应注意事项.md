The national college enrollment work for 1953 has concluded successfully. A total of 71,540 new students were enrolled this year. The unified list of newly enrolled students will be officially released on the 25th. In addition to issuing admission notices to each admitted student, the National College Enrollment Committee will publish the list of admitted students in local newspapers in each major administrative region.

This year, young students across the country enthusiastically applied for colleges and universities. Excluding the 7,000 primary school teachers and 4,000 normal school graduates directly transferred to higher normal schools, totaling 11,000 students who did not participate in the unified entrance examination, there were 80,128 applicants in the 73 examination areas (Tibet did not set up an examination area due to the lack of high schools) across the country. Among them, 54,698 were graduating high school students, accounting for 68.28 percent of the total number of applicants; 13,475 were educated youth from society, accounting for 16.83 percent; 8,754 were in-service cadres, accounting for 10.91 percent; 1,418 were graduates of Workers and Peasants’ Accelerated Middle Schools this year, accounting for 1.77 percent; 722 were outstanding graduates from secondary industrial technical schools and 398 were students who had completed their service period after graduation, totaling 1,120, accounting for 1.38 percent; 663 cadres were transferred, accounting for 0.83 percent. The number of applicants exceeded any previous year, which is one of the signs of the development of education at all levels (mainly senior high schools) and social spare-time education since liberation.

The political quality of the students applying this year is also relatively good. According to the statistics of the family background of the applicants, workers accounted for 7.47 percent; poor and lower-middle peasants accounted for 18.78 percent; revolutionary staff members accounted for 14.28 percent; and intellectual youth from worker, peasant, and revolutionary cadre families accounted for 40.53 percent. Communist Party members accounted for 2.62 percent of the applicants, and Communist Youth League members accounted for 34.74 percent. This is an important achievement of schools at all levels vigorously implementing the policy of opening the door to workers and peasants and strengthening the work of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League in schools. This batch of fresh blood will be cultivated into the backbone of senior construction talents for the new China.

In recent years, senior high schools have begun to overcome the phenomenon of being rushed and have paid attention to strengthening teaching work. Most schools conducted make-up classes and reviews during the summer vacation, and educated youth from society and in-service cadres actively studied on their own. As a result, the average total score of the admitted new students in each subject was above 230 or 240 points, which is 70 or 80 points higher than last year. However, the academic performance of the admitted new students is uneven in different regions. Taking the percentage of students with a total score of 280 points or more in each subject as a percentage of the total number of applicants in each region, the Northeast region accounted for 76 percent; the North China region accounted for 74.53 percent; the East China region accounted for 74.32 percent; the Central South region accounted for 58.52 percent; the Northwest region accounted for 53.76 percent; and the Southwest region accounted for 45.31 percent. The good quality of the students applying this year has created favorable conditions for improving the quality of teaching in colleges and universities.

However, because the education department did not pay enough attention to guiding senior high school graduates, educated youth from society, and in-service cadres in applying to higher schools, this year's candidates showed a lack of comprehensive understanding of national construction work in their choice of majors and departments. Generally, they applied for majors such as mechanical manufacturing, radio engineering, telecommunications, medicine, and art. As a result, the number of applicants for these departments exceeded the needs of the enrollment plan; while majors such as geology, mining, civil engineering, ordnance, various departments of higher normal schools, mathematics in science, finance and economics, politics and law, and sports had fewer applicants and could not meet the requirements of the enrollment plan. In terms of the choice of the length of study, there were more applicants for undergraduate courses and too few for specialized courses. In the choice of schools, more people applied to a few famous universities, with some schools exceeding their enrollment numbers by more than four times, while too few people applied to some newly established universities. In terms of regional choices, they were willing to go to universities in large cities, especially in Beijing, and were unwilling to go to schools in small and medium-sized cities. In order to fully realize this year's enrollment plan, the National Enrollment Committee conducted unified allocation based on national needs and with reference to individual admission wishes. The principles of this allocation are: First, to meet the needs of the national enrollment plan first, then appropriately consider the candidate's own admission wishes, and combine individual wishes with the national plan; Second, the admission scores of each subject should be based on the scores of the main courses; Third, when specifically allocating to various schools, departments and majors, the academic level of the students of the original school should be taken into account, and efforts should be made to ensure that the levels are uniform in order to facilitate teaching. In addition to drawing 12,000 people from the East China, Central South, and Southwest regions with more applicants to enroll in schools in North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China, reasonable adjustments were also made between various college departments and majors within each major region. In addition to recruiting 71,540 officially admitted students, a certain number of students with slightly lower test scores were selected as alternate students in order to supplement the number of mobile students during the registration process and were directly controlled by the schools, departments, and majors with fewer applicants.

National colleges and universities require new students to enroll in early October. In order to organize the admitted new students to register on time, the National College Enrollment Committee issued a notice and instructed some schools in the Northeast and North China regions to form a new student reception team to work in East China, Central South, and Southwest. At the same time, it requires the propaganda departments of local party committees, education administrative departments, the Communist Youth League of China, and local organizations of student federations, as well as senior high school teachers, to vigorously assist local enrollment agencies to carry out necessary publicity and education work and organizational work for the newly admitted students in the area, solve the difficulties of transportation and travel expenses for poor students, so that they can register and attend classes in the designated schools, departments and majors in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency: The National Higher Education Enrollment Committee issued the following urgent notice to all students applying for higher education this year: (1) After receiving the official admission notice from the National Higher Education Enrollment Committee, officially admitted new students should bring the following documents to register for admission on time according to the school, department, and major specified on the notice: (1) Admission ticket; (2) Academic certificate; (3) Household registration transfer certificate; (4) In-service cadres must bring proof of documents from the original service agency; (5) Those who had scholarships in senior high school should bring proof of scholarships from the original school; (6) Those whose family economy is really difficult and need to subsidize general study expenses must bring a certificate from the people's government above the district level; (7) Two half-length one- or two-inch bareheaded photos. (2) In addition to receiving the notification from the Enrollment Committee, alternate students must also receive a notification from the designated school allowing them to register for admission before they can go to register for admission (the documents to be carried during registration are the same as those for officially admitted students). (3) Due to the different basic construction conditions of various schools this year, the enrollment time for new students in most schools will be in early October, and a few schools may postpone it. Therefore, the specific time for registration and enrollment in each school will be determined by each school. (4) The lists of officially admitted and alternate students will be published in newspapers in the six major cities of Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Xi'an simultaneously on September 29. (5) The travel expenses required for registration and enrollment for newly admitted students are generally self-provided. Students whose families are really in difficulty can apply to the local enrollment agency for a subsidy for part or all of the travel expenses after obtaining relevant proof. (6) Students transferred from East China, Central South, and Southwest to Northeast, North China, and Northwest should negotiate with the transportation department through the local enrollment agency to purchase collective train and boat tickets. (7) All national colleges and universities should conscientiously do all the necessary preparations for welcoming new students.

    全国高等学校招考新生工作结束
    今年录取新生七万一千多名
    招生委员会通知新生入学时应注意事项
    一九五三年度全国高等学校招考新生工作已胜利结束，今年被录取的新生共七万一千五百四十名。新生统一分配的名单，在二十五日正式发榜。全国高等学校招生委员会除对每一个录取新生发给录取通知外，各大行政区录取新生的名单将在当地报纸上公布。
    今年全国各地青年学生报考高等学校的很踊跃，除高等师范学校直接抽调七千名小学教师和四千名师范学校毕业生共一万一千名入学没有参加统一招考外，分设在全国各个省市七十三个考区（西藏因无高中未设考区）共有报考新生八万零一百二十八名。其中有本届高中毕业生五万四千六百九十八名，占报考学生总数百分之六十八点二八；社会知识青年一万三千四百七十五名，占百分之一十六点八三；在职干部八千七百五十四名，占百分之一十点九一；工农速成中学本年毕业生一千四百一十八名，占百分之一点七七；中等工业技术学校本届优秀毕业生七百二十二名和毕业后服务期满的学生三百九十八名共一千一百二十人，占百分之一点三八；抽调干部六百六十三名，占百分之零点八三。报考人数超过历史上任何一年，这是解放以来各级学校教育（其中主要是高级中学）和社会业余教育发展的标志之一。
    今年报考学生政治质量也较好，据报考学生家庭成分统计，工人占百分之七点四七；雇农、贫农、中农占百分之一十八点七八；革命职员占百分之一十四点二八；工农和革命干部家庭出身的知识青年占百分之四十点五三。报考学生中共产党员占百分之二点六二；青年团员占百分之三十四点七四。这是各级学校大力贯彻向工农开门的方针和学校共产党、青年团工作加强的重要成果，这批新鲜的血液将会培养成为新中国高级建设人材的骨干。
    由于近年来高级中学开始克服了忙乱现象和注意加强教学工作，大部分学校今年暑期又进行了补课和复习，社会知识青年和机关在职干部又都积极努力自修。因而今年被录取新生学科成绩各科总分平均在二百三十分或二百四十分以上，比去年要提高七十分或八十分。但被录取新生学科成绩在各地区是不平衡的，以各科总分在二百八十分以上的学生占各地区报考学生总数的百分比来说，东北区占百分之七十六；华北区占百分之七十四点五三；华东区占百分之七十四点三二；中南区占百分之五十八点五二；西北区占百分之五十三点七六；西南区占百分之四十五点三一。由于今年报考的学生质量较好，就为提高高等学校教学质量创造了有利的条件。
    但是，由于教育部门平日对高级中学毕业生和社会知识青年、机关在职干部的指导升学工作注意得不够，以致今年考生在报考的志愿上及科系选择上表现对国家建设工作缺乏全面认识，一般多是报考工科中的机械制造、无线电工学和电讯、医科、艺术等科系专业，因此造成这些科系报考的人就超过了招生计划的需要；而工科中的地质、采矿、土木建筑、兵工等专业，高等师范学校各个科系，理科中的数学，财经、政法、体育等科系专业，报考的人较少，不能满足招生计划的要求。在修业年限选择上，报本科的较多，报专修科的太少。在学校选择上，少数著名高等学校报考的人较多，个别学校超过招生数四倍以上，有些新成立的高等学校报名的太少。在地区选择上愿到大城市特别是愿到北京的高等学校，不愿到中小城市的学校。全国招生委员会为了全面地实现今年的招生计划，根据国家需要和参照个人入学志愿，进行统一的分配。这次分配的原则是：一、首先要满足国家招生计划的需要，再适当地照顾考生本人的入学志愿，并使个人志愿与国家计划相结合；二、各科录取成绩以各科主要课程成绩为主；三、具体分配到各校科系专业时，要照顾到原校的学生程度，力求程度整齐，以利教学。除从报考学生较多的华东、中南、西南三区抽调一万二千人到华北、东北、西北学校入学外，各大区内部各个高等学校科系专业之间也进行了合理的调整。除了取满七万一千五百四十人正式录取生外，为着补足报到过程中的流动人数，又选择考试成绩稍差的一定名额作为备取生，交给报考志愿较少的学校科系专业直接掌握。
    全国高等学校要求新生在十月上旬入学。为了组织被录取新生能按时报到入学，全国高等学校招生委员会发出通知并责成东北区及华北区部分学校组成迎接新生入学工作组到华东、中南、西南进行工作，同时要求各地党委宣传部门、教育行政部门、中国新民主主义青年团和学生联合会的各地组织以及高级中学教师，大力协助当地招生机构，根据统一分配的名单，对当地被录取的新生进行必要的宣传教育工作和组织工作，解决交通工具和贫苦学生的旅费困难，使他们能及时到指定的学校科系专业去注册上课。　（新华社）
    全国高等学校招生委员会向今年全体报考高等学校的学生发出紧急通知如下：（一）正式被录取的新生，在接到全国高等学校招生委员会的正式通知书后，根据通知书上指定的学校科系专业携带下列证件按时报到入学：（1）准考证；（2）学历证件；（3）户口迁移证；（4）在职干部要带原服务机关证明文件；（5）原在高级中学有助学金的要带原校助学金证明；（6）家庭经济实在困难需要补助一般学习费用的，须带区以上人民政府的证明；（7）本人半身一、二寸脱帽照片两张。（二）备取生除接到招生委员会通知外，还须接到指定学校的允许报到入学通知后才能前去报到入学（报到时应携带的证件与正式录取生同）。（三）由于今年各个学校基本建设情况不同，大多数学校新生入学时间将在十月上旬，少数学校可能延期。因此，各校报到入学的具体时间将由各校掌握。（四）正式录取和备取学生名单将在九月二十九日同时在北京、沈阳、上海、武汉、重庆、西安六大城市报纸上公布。（五）被录取的新生报到入学所需的旅费一般以自备为原则，家庭实在困难的学生，在取得有关的证明后，可向当地招生机构申请补助一部或全部旅费。（六）华东、中南、西南外调到东北、华北、西北的学生，应通过当地招生机构向交通部门交涉集体购买车船票。（七）全国各个高等学校应认真做好迎接新生入学的各项必要的准备工作。
