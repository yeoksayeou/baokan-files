Economic Cooperation and Mutual Assistance Among Countries of the Peace and Democracy Camp
	Chen Youwei

Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his speech at the closing session of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "The Soviet government attaches particular importance to further strengthening relations with the countries of the democratic camp. ... The decisive advantage of the democratic camp and one of its fundamental differences from the imperialist camp is that it will not be divided by internal contradictions and struggles, and the main source of its strength and progress is the mutual concern for the interests of all countries in the democratic camp and their close economic cooperation. Therefore, the friendly relations between the countries of the democratic camp and their fraternal cooperation will continue to develop and be constantly consolidated."

The economic cooperation among the countries of the peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, is a manifestation of a completely new type of international relations that has never existed in history. This cooperation is based on the fundamental interests of the working people of all countries and the principles of proletarian internationalism, and its purpose is to achieve common economic upsurge. The infinitely rich natural resources spread across the vast land from the Pacific to the Baltic Sea, and the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production in various countries, provide a very solid material foundation for economic cooperation among countries. In particular, the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to the people's democratic countries has become an important factor in the rapid development of economic cooperation and mutual assistance among countries of the democratic camp.

Foreign trade is the most important form of economic cooperation among the countries of the peace and democracy camp. In recent years, trade between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries has continued to expand, in stark contrast to the increasing shrinkage of trade with the capitalist world. Before World War II, the Soviet Union's share in the foreign trade of six countries, including Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, averaged less than 1 percent; but by 1951, it had increased to an average of more than 40 percent. From 1946 to 1952, the volume of foreign trade among the five countries of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria increased almost six and a half times. The volume of trade between our country and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries has also increased rapidly in the past three years. In 1952, China's exports to the Soviet Union accounted for 54 percent of total exports, and imports accounted for 53 percent. The proportion of trade between our country and the countries of the peace and democracy camp in our country's total foreign trade value has increased from 26 percent in 1950 to 72 percent in 1952. From 1948 to 1952, the total volume of foreign trade among the countries of the peace and democracy camp has increased more than twofold.

The circulation of commodities in the democratic world market is carried out and developed entirely according to the needs of the continuous improvement of the economies of various countries. In this market, every democratic country can find the various materials necessary for the development of its own economy, and export materials that are needed by other friendly countries and are abundant or unique to its own country. For example, Bulgaria exchanges mineral products, tobacco, and fresh fruits for the Soviet Union's industrial equipment and agricultural machinery; Romania exports oil and timber to Czechoslovakia and obtains metallurgical and chemical industrial products from there; the German Democratic Republic exchanges precision instruments, optical instruments, and electrical equipment for Hungary's agricultural products and motorcycles; Poland exports locomotives and coal mining equipment to Albania, and the latter supplies the former with petroleum, asphalt, and tobacco.

The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have now successively entered the stage of implementing long-term plans for the development of the national economy, so it is possible for them to sign long-term trade agreements and coordinate the national economic plans of various countries with each other. In this way, every country can foresee and continuously obtain the machinery, equipment, raw materials, and various commodities it needs within a certain period of time, and at the same time ensure the sale of its own products. That is to say, when developing the national economy, every country in the peace and democracy camp can not only rely on its own resources and its own production capacity, but also estimate in advance the economic assistance that various friendly brother countries can provide.

The Soviet Union, with its strong strength and advanced technology, provides a wide variety of commodities needed by various countries. This plays the most important role in the development and consolidation of the democratic world market and in the economic upsurge of various countries. The Soviet Union exports various kinds of commodities to the people's democratic countries, including: machinery, lathes, power equipment, agricultural machinery, non-ferrous metals, mineral sands, petroleum and chemical products, as well as cotton, grain, and daily consumer goods for the people. From 1948 to 1952, the Soviet Union's supply of machinery and industrial equipment to the people's democratic countries increased tenfold. The number of machines imported by our country from the Soviet Union has increased year by year. If we take 1950 as 100, then by 1952, the import of mining machinery had increased to 257.1 percent, and the drilling machine increased to 358.77 percent. From 1946 to 1951, Bulgaria's imports of machinery and equipment from the Soviet Union almost increased sixfold.

Not only that, the Soviet Union has also given a large amount of credit loans to various countries, which can generally be divided into three categories: 1. Credit for the supply of food and raw materials to various countries; 2. Gold and currency credit; 3. Long-term credit for the supply of machinery and equipment to various countries. The former includes the credit provided by the Soviet Union to the Eastern European people's democratic countries, which suffered severe war damage, for the supply of food and raw materials shortly after the end of the European War, and the recent extra supply of food and raw materials worth 231 million rubles to the German Democratic Republic; the second includes the agreement signed in December 1948 for the Soviet Union to grant Czechoslovakia a gold loan, and the agreement signed in February 1950 for the Soviet Union to grant our country a US$300 million loan (for our country to use to pay for the purchase of machinery equipment and various construction equipment); the latter includes the credit agreement signed in June 1950 for the Soviet Union to supply Poland with industrial equipment during the period 1951-1958. The credit loans granted by the Soviet Union to the people's democratic countries play a significant role in promoting the economic development of the brother countries, which is fundamentally different from the various investments made by imperialism in order to control and enslave other countries and make them subordinate to itself.

The joint operation of enterprises by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries based on the principle of equality is one of the main forms of their economic cooperation. These enterprises are established in the form of joint-stock companies, with their capital divided equally, each belonging to the governments of the Soviet Union and the country where the enterprise is located. The Soviet-Romanian joint-stock company is a typical example of a joint-stock enterprise between the Soviet Union and a people's democratic country. With the Soviet Union supplying equipment and providing technical personnel, this company, which operates business departments including petroleum, transportation, and tractors, has enabled Romania to now produce almost all the equipment needed by its own petroleum industry, to manufacture inland river vessels and medium-sized seagoing ships, and to establish its own tractor industry, mass-producing for the first time various agricultural machines, including crawler tractors. It should be pointed out that this kind of joint-stock company does not enjoy any privileges at all, but strictly abides by the various laws and regulations of the country where it is located. In the leadership of the enterprise and the distribution of profits, the principle of equality between the two parties is fully observed. The quantity, type, price, and sales of products are controlled by the country where the company is located. The various products produced by this kind of joint-stock company are primarily intended to meet the needs of the economic development and people's livelihood of the country where it is located. This is completely different from the fact that imperialism uses the form of joint-stock companies (such as the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Iran) to plunder the resources of other countries, strangle the national industries of backward countries, and extract high profits.

Scientific and technological assistance, the exchange of advanced experiences, and the mutual training of cadres are also important aspects of economic cooperation and mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries often sign scientific and technological cooperation agreements to exchange the latest achievements they have obtained in scientific technology and production organization.

The Soviet Union is a treasure trove of experience in building socialism for the people's democratic countries. It often provides brother countries with various patent rights and licenses free of charge, enabling them to quickly equip their industries with the latest technology. For example, Czechoslovakia used the technical designs of Soviet coal mining combines and walking excavators, Romania used the Soviet drilling equipment and harvester design blueprints, and Poland and Hungary began to build subways in their capitals based on the design and construction blueprints of the Moscow subway. The comprehensive assistance provided by the Soviet Union in science and technology is of great significance to the economic construction of the people's democratic countries. As Comrade Stalin pointed out: "No capitalist country can give the people's democratic countries such genuine assistance and technically skilled assistance as the Soviet Union. The problem is not only that this assistance is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The problem is first of all that the basis of this cooperation is a sincere desire for mutual assistance and common economic upsurge."

The Soviet Union's assistance to the people's democratic countries is not merely the supply of various commodities. Its purpose is to enable the brother countries to transform their industries with the latest technology and equipment in the shortest possible time and accelerate the development of their national economies. With the assistance of the Soviet Union in providing complete sets of equipment and technical guidance, Bulgaria built the Stalin Chemical Factory, the largest in the Balkan Peninsula, with an annual output of 70,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, Poland and Romania established their own automobile and tractor industries, Hungary built the Stalin Varos Metallurgical Factory, whose annual output will exceed the total steel output of the entire pre-war Hungary, and Albania built the Stalin Textile Factory, which meets the clothing needs of the entire country. The expansion and construction of our country's Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the China Changchun Railway, the Fuxin Open-pit Coal Mine, and the Harbin Flax Factory have also received great assistance from the Soviet Union. A significant favorable condition for the people's democratic countries to build the foundation of socialism today is that they will no longer suffer the huge difficulties that the Soviet Union suffered in the past under the capitalist encirclement and international isolation, but can receive the selfless and comprehensive assistance of the powerful socialist country and the strong support of the entire peace and democracy camp.

Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic, which are relatively developed industrially and technologically advanced, also often provide other people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe with technical assistance. For example, the construction of power stations in Romania and the construction of textile factories in Bulgaria have received assistance from technical experts from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic. In addition, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries often send exchange students and trainee cadres to each other, and often organize various visiting groups and delegations to go to the brother countries to exchange experiences. Various rich industrial and agricultural exhibitions held among the brother countries are also an effective form of exchanging experiences, learning from each other, and promoting cooperation.

European people's democratic countries are also carrying out cooperation in developing industrial mutual assistance and jointly developing and using natural resources. For example, the mutual assistance agreement between Hungary and Czechoslovakia stipulates that the bauxite produced in Hungary will be transported to Czechoslovakia for aluminum refining, while the Hungarian-Romanian mutual assistance agreement stipulates that the natural gas of Romania will be used to establish new chemical factories in the two countries, and that high-voltage transmission lines will be erected for the common use of the two countries in order to more effectively use power sources to meet the needs of the industrial development of the two countries.

The friendly cooperation and sincere mutual assistance among the countries of the peace and democracy camp have brought about the expected results of the common economic upsurge of the countries. The Soviet Union's total industrial output this year will be almost two and a half times that of pre-war 1940, and 29 times that of 1925. The industrial output of the European people's democratic countries in 1952 increased by an average of nearly two times compared with the pre-war period. At present, the socialist industrial output of the European people's democratic countries accounts for more than 95 to 99 percent of the total industrial production, and the proportion of industry in the national economy in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary has exceeded 70 percent, while Romania and Bulgaria, while continuously improving agricultural production, have also exceeded 60 percent and 50 percent respectively. The development of our country's economy in the three years since liberation has also been very rapid. In 1952, the output of many industrial products other than coal exceeded the highest annual output in our country's history, and the steel output was more than nine times that of 1949. At present, in our country's entire modern industry, the proportion of state-owned industry has reached about 60 percent. Due to the rapid development of industry in various countries, many industrial products that originally needed to be imported in large quantities by the people's democratic countries can now be exported. And on the basis of economic development, the people's material and cultural living standards have also been improved.

The common economic upsurge of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries has greatly strengthened the strength of the democratic camp, thus providing a more reliable guarantee for the cause of world peace, which is a great encouragement to the people of all countries in the capitalist world who are striving for national independence and social progress.

The US aggressive bloc forced Britain, France, and other countries to impose an economic blockade on the Soviet Union, China, and the European people's democratic countries, in an attempt to stifle them. However, not only did it not achieve its goal, but it consolidated the new democratic world market formed by these countries and deepened the economic crisis of capitalism. Recently, the United States has been forcing its satellite countries to continue to implement this bankrupt policy, but this has aroused dissatisfaction among the public opinion and some members of the ruling class in these countries. The Soviet Union, China, and the European people's democratic countries are always welcome to restore and increase trade relations with capitalist countries, because this is helpful to world peace and international cooperation, and it is also in the interests of the people of all countries.

    和平民主阵营各国的经济合作与互助
    陈有为
    马林科夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议闭幕会议上的演说中，曾经指出：“苏联政府特别重视进一步加强与民主阵营各国的关系。……民主阵营的具有决定意义的优点和它与帝国主义阵营的根本区别之一，便是它不会因内部的矛盾和斗争而分裂，它的力量和进步的主要泉源，便是对于民主阵营一切国家的利益的相互关切和它们之间的密切的经济合作。因此，民主阵营各国间的友好关系和它们的兄弟般的合作将不断地发展，不断地巩固。”
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国之间的经济合作，是历史上从未有过的一种完全新型的国际关系的表现，这种合作是建立在各国劳动人民的根本利益与无产阶级国际主义原则之上的，其目的是为了求得共同的经济高涨。遍布在从太平洋到波罗的海这一片广阔土地上的无限丰富的自然资源，和各国工农业生产的迅速发展，为各国间的经济合作提供了十分雄厚的物质基础。特别是苏联对各人民民主国家的无私援助，成了民主阵营国家经济合作互助事业迅速发展的重要因素。
    对外贸易是和平民主阵营各国之间经济合作的最主要的形式。近几年来，苏联和人民民主国家之间的贸易不断扩展，与资本主义世界贸易的日益萎缩成了强烈的对照。在第二次世界大战以前，苏联在阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克等六国对外贸易中所占的比重，平均还不到百分之一；而到一九五一年时，却已平均增加到百分之四十以上了。一九四六年至一九五二年间，波、捷、匈、罗、保等五个国家相互之间的对外贸易额差不多增加了六倍半。我国对苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易额，最近三年来也有了迅速的增长。一九五二年我国对苏联的出口占出口总额的百分之五十四，进口占百分之五十三。我国对和平民主阵营各国的贸易，在我国对外贸易总值中所占的比重，已从一九五零年的百分之二十六增加到一九五二年的百分之七十二。从一九四八年到一九五二年，和平民主阵营各国之间的对外贸易总额，已经增加了两倍以上。
    民主世界市场上的商品流转，是完全根据各国经济不断提高的需要而进行和发展的。在这个市场上，每一个民主国家可以找到发展本国经济所必需的各种物资，并输出为其他友好国家所需而又是本国所盛产或特产的物资。例如：保加利亚以矿产品、烟草和鲜果换取苏联的工业设备与农业机器；罗马尼亚向捷克斯洛伐克输出石油和木材，并从那里得到冶金和化学工业的产品；德意志民主共和国以精密仪器、光学仪器和电工器材交换匈牙利的农业品与摩托车；波兰向阿尔巴尼亚输出机车、采煤工业设备，而后者则以石油、沥青和烟草供给前者。
    苏联和各人民民主国家现在都已相继进入了实行长期发展国民经济计划的阶段，因此它们之间已有可能签订长期的贸易协定，而使得各国的国民经济计划能够彼此协调。这样，每一个国家可能预知并在一定时期内源源不绝地得到本国所需的机器、装备、原料和各种商品，同时也使本国产品的销售得到了保证。也就是说，和平民主阵营里的每一个国家在发展国民经济的时候，不仅可以依靠本国的资源和本国的生产能力，而且还可以把各个友好的兄弟国家在经济上所可能提供的帮助事先估计在内。
    实力雄厚、技术先进的苏联，提供了为各国所需的品种繁多的商品物资。这对于民主世界市场的发展和巩固，以及对于各国经济的高涨起着最主要的作用。苏联对各人民民主国家输出各种各样的商品，其中包括：机器、车床、动力装备、农业机械、有色金属、矿砂、石油和化学产品以至棉花、粮食与人民日用消费品等。在一九四八年到一九五二年间，苏联供应各人民民主国家的机器和工业装备，已增加到十倍。我国自苏联进口的机器逐年增多，如以一九五○年为一百，则到一九五二年时，矿山机械的进口已增为百分之二百五十七点一，钻探机增为百分之三百五十八点七七。保加利亚从一九四六年到一九五一年间从苏联输入的机器和装备几乎增加了六倍。
    不仅这样，苏联还给了各国大量的信用贷款，这些信用贷款一般可以分为三类：一、以粮食和原料供应各国的信贷；二、黄金与货币信贷；三、以机器装备供应各国的长期信贷。前者如苏联在欧战结束不久时对深遭战争灾害的东欧各人民民主国家供应粮食与原料的信贷，和最近对民主德国额外供应价值两亿三千一百万卢布的食物与原料的信贷；第二种如一九四八年十二月签订的苏联给予捷克斯洛伐克以黄金贷款的协定，和一九五○年二月签订的苏联给予我国三亿美元贷款（供我国用以偿付购买机器设备与各项建设器材之用）的协定；后者如一九五○年六月签订的一九五一—一九五八年间苏联以工业装备供应波兰的信贷协定。苏联给予各人民民主国家的信用贷款，对于促进各兄弟国家经济的发展起着重大的作用，这与帝国主义为了控制和奴役别国、使之附属于自己的各种投资，是根本不同的。
    苏联与各人民民主国家根据平等原则合股经营企业，是它们经济合作的主要形式之一。这些企业按照合股公司的形式成立，其资金平分两半，各属于苏联和该企业所在国的政府。苏罗合股公司是苏联和人民民主国家合股经营企业的一个典型例子。在苏联供应装备和提供技术人员的情况之下，这个经营着包括石油、运输和拖拉机等业务部门的公司，已经使罗马尼亚现在能够生产本国石油工业所需的近乎全部的设备，能够制造内河船只与中型的航海船舶，并建立起了本国的拖拉机工业，在历史上第一次大量生产包括履带式拖拉机在内的各式农业机器。应该指出，这种合股公司丝毫也不享有任何特权，而是严格遵照所在国的各项法规而活动的。在企业的领导和利润的分配上，完全遵守双方平等的原则。而在产品的数量、种类、价格与销售方面，则受所在国的控制。这种合股公司所出产的各项产品，首先是为了满足所在国的经济发展与人民生活的需要。这和帝国主义利用合股公司（例如在伊朗的前英伊石油公司）形式来掠夺他国资源、扼杀落后国家民族工业、榨取高额利润的事实是不可同日而语的。
    科学技术上的帮助、先进经验的交流和互相培养干部，也是苏联和各人民民主国家之间进行经济合作与互助的重要内容。苏联和各人民民主国家相互之间经常签订科学与技术合作协定，交流它们在科学技术与生产组织上所获得的最新成就。
    苏联是各人民民主国家建设社会主义的经验的宝库，它经常以各种专利权和许可证无偿地供给兄弟国家，使它们能够很快地以最新技术来装备工业。如捷克斯洛伐克利用了苏联的采煤康拜因、走动挖土机的技术设计，罗马尼亚利用了苏联的钻探设备与收割机的设计蓝图，波兰与匈牙利根据莫斯科地下铁道的设计与建筑蓝图而开始在本国首都兴建地下铁道。苏联在科学技术上所提供的全面的帮助，对于各人民民主国家的经济建设有着很重要意义，这正如斯大林同志所指出的：“没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚
    愿望。”
    苏联对各人民民主国家的援助，不仅是单纯供应各种商品而已，其目的是为了使各兄弟国家在最短期内以最新式的技术与装备来改造本国的工业，加速其国民经济的发展。在苏联提供全套装备与技术指导的帮助之下，保加利亚建立起了年产七万吨化学肥料的巴尔干半岛上最大的斯大林化学工厂，波兰和罗马尼亚建立起了本国的汽车与拖拉机工业，匈牙利兴建了年产量将超过战前匈牙利全国钢铁产量的斯大林瓦若斯冶金工厂，阿尔巴尼亚建立了满足全国人民衣着之需的斯大林纺织工厂。我国鞍山钢铁公司、中长铁路与阜新露天煤矿、哈尔滨亚麻工厂等的扩充和建设，也得到了苏联的大力帮助。各人民民主国家今天建设社会主义基础的一个意义重大的有利条件是，它们不会再遭受到像过去苏联那样在资本主义包围与国际孤立情况之下所遭受到的巨大困难，而可以得到强大的社会主义国家的大公无私的全面帮助和整个和平民主阵营的有力支持了。
    工业比较发达、技术比较先进的捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国，也经常给东欧其他人民民主国家以技术上的帮助。如罗马尼亚的动力站的建设，保加利亚纺织工厂的建设，就曾得到捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国技术专家们的帮助。此外，苏联和各人民民主国家还常常互派留学生与实习干部，并经常组织各种参观团和代表团到各兄弟国家去交流经验。在各兄弟国家之间互相举办的各种内容丰富的工农业展览会，也是交流经验、互相学习和增进合作的一种有效形式。
    欧洲各人民民主国家之间也进行着发展工业上
    的互助与共同开发和使用自然富源的合作。例如，匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克的互助协定规定，以匈牙利所盛产的铁矾土运往捷克斯洛伐克炼制铝，匈罗互助
    协定则规定利用罗马尼亚的天然煤气在两国建立新
    的化学工厂，并架设两国公用的高压输电线，以便
    更加有效地利用动力来源来满足两国发展工业的需要。
    和平民主阵营各国之间的友好合作与真诚互助，带来了各国经济共同高涨的预期结果。苏联今年的工业总产量差不多将等于战前一九四○年的两倍半，而为一九二五年的二十九倍。欧洲各人民民主国家的工业产量在一九五二年平均已比战前增加了近两倍。现在欧洲各人民民主国家的社会主义工业产量已占全部工业生产量的百分之九十五至九十九以上，而工业在国民经济中的比重，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利都已超过了百分之七十，罗马尼亚和保加利亚在农业生产量不断提高的同时，也已分别超过了百分之六十和五十。我国经济在解放三年多来的发展也是十分迅速的。一九五二年除煤以外的许多工业品产量都已超过了我国历史上最高的年产量，钢产量等于一九四九年的九倍多。现在，我国全部现代工业中，国营工业的比重已达到了百分之六十左右。由于各国工业的迅速发展，人民民主国家许多原来需要大量输入的工业品，现在已经可以输出了。而在经济发展的基础上，人民的物质与文化生活水平也提高了。
    苏联和各人民民主国家经济的共同高涨，大大地加强了民主阵营的实力，因而使世界和平事业得到了更加可靠的保障，这对于正在争取民族独立与社会进步的资本主义世界各国人民，是一种极大的鼓舞。
    美国侵略集团强迫英法等国对苏联、中国及欧洲各人民民主国家实行经济封锁，想以此窒杀它们，然而不仅没有达到目的，反而巩固了这些国家所构成的新的民主世界市场，加深了资本主义的经济危机。最近，美国还在强迫各仆从国家继续实行这个破了产的政策，但已引起了这些国家的舆论和统治阶级一些人士的不满。苏联、中国和欧洲人民民主国家是随时欢迎与资本主义各国恢复和增进贸易关系的，因为这样对世界和平和国际合作是有帮助
    的，而且也是符合各国人民的利益的。
