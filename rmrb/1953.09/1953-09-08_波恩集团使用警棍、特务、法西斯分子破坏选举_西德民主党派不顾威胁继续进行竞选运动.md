Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 7th (TASS dispatch): The West German federal parliament elections were held on September 6th to elect 484 members of the federal parliament. Voting began at 8:00 AM local time and ended at 6:00 PM, followed by the counting of votes. The number of West German voters is 33 million.

Hamburg Radio reported: Approximately 80 percent of voters cast their ballots.

According to Deutsche Presse-Agentur: The election was conducted in a tense atmosphere. For this election, West German authorities mobilized 100,000 police officers, on standby at all times. Groups of mobile police were stationed in front of many polling stations. In many cities in the Ruhr area, police cars traveled from one polling station to another. In Munich and other places, in addition to police and plainclothes secret agents, the authorities also had so-called "local defense corps" led by fascists.

The police and fascists tore down campaign slogans of the Communist Party, the All-German People's Party, and the Social Democratic Party, while campaign slogans of the Christian Democratic Union and other government coalition parties were posted everywhere.

According to news from Bonn: Election results are expected to be announced on the morning of September 7th.

Xinhua News Agency, September 7th, Berlin News: On the eve of the West German elections, the Bonn ruling clique used batons and fascist terrorists to intensify the terror and persecution of parties opposing Adenauer's election, and to arrest West German patriots and travelers from Democratic Germany to West Germany en masse. In order to carry out this task, in addition to using the police, Adenauer also established the so-called "civilian election protection force," organizing various fascist elements to carry out terrorist activities.

In Cologne and Mülheim, terrorists from the "German Youth League" threw explosives at places where the Communist Party was holding election rallies. In Frankfurt am Main, terrorists from the "German Youth League" rode in trucks of the American military newspaper "Stars and Stripes" back and forth in front of the Communist Party's district headquarters, and set fire to many windows displaying the "Socialist People's Newspaper" with burning liquid.

In Warendorf, Münster district, fascist thugs smashed the windows of the Communist Party's local headquarters on the night before the election. In Cologne, police arrested people posting Communist Party election leaflets. The police also searched and wrecked Communist Party offices.

Members of the youth organizations of Adenauer's government coalition parties also attacked a Social Democratic Party election demonstration in Jenfeld, Hamburg, on September 3rd. In many other cities, many Social Democratic Party members posting campaign slogans were also attacked. For this reason, in Lambrecht, members of the Social Democratic youth organization "Eagle Troupe" and Communist youth members jointly protected the election posters of the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party.

American occupation forces also mobilized to help Adenauer "maintain order." In southern Hesse, large numbers of American troops stood guard at various intersections with automatic rifles.

At the same time, starting from September 1st, the Bonn government began a large-scale arrest of West German patriotic democrats and travelers from the German Democratic Republic to West Germany, and the total number of people arrested has reached several thousand. The excuse for the mass arrest was "the intrusion of East German communists," while the real content was to intimidate voters and strengthen anti-German Democratic Republic propaganda. According to Adenauer's order, the Bonn border police used tyrannical means to deal with travelers from the German Democratic Republic to West Germany. At the border, they used guns and rubber batons to force travelers with valid inter-zone documents to leave the carriages and detain them. Adenauer issued a statement to the press on the 3rd, saying that all people from the German Democratic Republic to West Germany should be detained until after the September 6th election.

Xinhua News Agency, September 7th, Berlin News (TASS dispatch): The German Communist Party and other progressive parties, regardless of the Bonn authorities' despicable persecution and open terrorist means, bravely and firmly carry out their own election campaigns. In the election campaign, the German Communist Party held grand rallies and meetings, at which German Communist Party activists nominated as candidates for the Federal Parliament delivered speeches to the working people.

On September 4th, German Communist Party Chairman Max Reimann delivered a speech at an election rally of 20,000 people in Essen. Max Reimann pointed out that the Adenauer regime has brought fatal consequences to the cause of German peace and unification and the welfare of West German residents in the past four years. He called on the working people of the Ruhr to vote for the Communist Party candidates in the upcoming elections, because the Communist Party candidates are loyal defenders of the unification and independence of the motherland, and brave protectors of the interests of the working people. The Chairman of the German Communist Party denounced the statement of US Secretary of State Dulles, saying that this was the US interfering in the election struggle on Adenauer's side, with the aim of putting pressure on voters to ensure the victory of the government coalition parties. Heinz Renner, a member of the Federal Parliament, emphasized in his speech: The cause of peace, national reunification, and the happy future of the German people is in the hands of the German people themselves.

The German League for Unity, Peace, and Freedom held an election rally in Bamberg. Engineer Plem, a representative of the party, delivered a speech at the meeting. He emphasized that Adenauer is the main obstacle to a peaceful solution to the German question, eliminating division, and achieving German unification. The current requirement is to reach an all-German agreement.

In order to try to maintain their rule, the Bonn Group mobilized propagandists and police to obstruct the election campaigns of progressive parties, especially the Communist Party's election campaign. The authorities bought up groups of fascists to go to the German Communist Party, the German League for Unity, Peace, and Freedom, and the All-German People's Party to hold meetings and use various means to disrupt the meetings of these parties. On the 4th, when former Weimar Republic Prime Minister Jo Wirth delivered a speech at a rally in Karlsruhe, more than 100 fascist bandits, with the direct connivance of the police, disrupted the meeting. When Heinz Renner, a member of the Federal Parliament, delivered a speech at a German Communist Party election rally in Kassel, a group of provocateurs similarly attempted to prevent the working people from listening to the speeches of the Communist Party candidates.

    波恩集团使用警棍、特务、法西斯分子破坏选举
    西德民主党派不顾威胁继续进行竞选运动
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社柏林七日讯：西德联邦议院选举于九月六日举行，选举联邦议院的四百八十四个议员。投票从当地时间早上八时开始，到十八时结束，接着便开始数票。西德选民的人数为三千三百万。
    汉堡电台报道：约有百分之八十的选民投了票。
    据德意志通讯社报道：选举是在紧张的气氛中进行的。为了这次选举，西德当局动员了十万名警察，随时戒备。在许多投票站前面，有一群群的机动警察在站岗。在鲁尔区许多城市中，警车从一个投票站开到另一个投票站。在慕尼黑和其他地方，当局除了拥有警察和便衣特务以外，还有以法西斯分子为首的所谓“地方防务团”。
    警察和法西斯分子把共产党、全德人民党以及社会民主党的竞选标语都撕了下来，而基督教民主联盟和其他的政府联盟党派的竞选标语却到处张贴着。
    据波恩的消息说：选举结果可望于九月七日晨揭晓。
    【新华社七日讯】柏林消息：在西德选举的前夕，波恩统治集团利用警棍和法西斯恐怖分子，加紧对反对阿登纳当选的党派的竞选活动进行恐怖迫害，并大批逮捕西德爱国分子与从民主德国到西德的旅客。为了执行这个任务，除了使用警察，阿登纳还成立了所谓“保护选举的民军”，把各种法西斯分子组织起来进行恐怖活动。
    在科隆和米尔海姆，“德国青年联盟”的恐怖分子把爆炸物扔到共产党举行竞选集会的地方。在美因河畔法兰克福，“德国青年联盟”的恐怖分子乘坐着美国军方“星条报”的卡车，在共产党区总部的门前来回行驶，并以燃烧液放火焚烧许多陈列着“社会主义人民报”的橱窗。
    在门斯特区的华伦道尔夫，法西斯党徒在选举前一天的晚上，打碎了共产党该地总部的窗户。在科隆，警察逮捕张贴共产党选举传单的人。警察还搜查和捣毁了共产党机关。
    阿登纳政府联合党派的青年组织的成员，九月三日也袭击了社会民主党在汉堡的燕菲尔德举行的选举示威。在其他的许多城市中，许多张贴竞选标语的社会民主党员也遭到袭击。为此，在兰姆布莱希特，社会民主党的青年组织“鹰团”团员和共产党的青年党员曾联合起来保护社会民主党与共产党的选举招贴。
    美国占领军也出动帮助阿登纳“维持秩序”，在黑森南部，大批美国军队手持自动步枪在各十字路口站岗。
    同时，从九月一日起，波恩政府开始大规模逮捕西德的爱国民主人士和从德意志民主共和国到西德的旅客，被逮捕的总人数已达数千人。大逮捕的藉口是“东德共产党人的侵入”，而真正内容是恫吓选民并加强反德意志民主共和国的宣传。根据阿登纳的命令，波恩边界警察使用了横暴的手段对付从德意志民主共和国到西德的旅客。他们在边界上用枪枝和橡皮警棍强迫带着有效的区际文件的旅客离开车厢，把他们拘留起来。阿登纳三日向报界发表声明说，所有从德意志民主共和国到西德的人要拘留到九月六日选举以后。
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社柏林五日讯：德国共产党和其他进步党派不顾波恩当局的卑鄙的迫害和公开的恐怖手段，勇敢坚强地进行自己的竞选运动。德国共产党在竞选运动中，举行盛大的集会和会议，被提名为联邦议员候选人的德国共产党活动家在这些会议上向劳动人民发表演说。
    九月四日，德国共产党主席马克斯·雷曼在埃森的一个两万人的竞选集会上发表演说。马克斯·雷曼指出，阿登纳政权在四年中给德国和平与统一的事业以及西德居民的福利带来了致命的后果。他号召鲁尔的劳动人民在即将来到的选举中投共产党候选人的票，因为共产党候选人是祖国的统一和独立的忠实捍卫者，是劳动人民利益的勇敢保护者。德国共产党主席痛斥美国国务卿杜勒斯的声明，说这是美国站在阿登纳方面干涉竞选斗争，目的在对选民施行压力，以保证政府联合党派的胜利。联邦议院议员海恩茨·雷纳在演说中着重地说：和平、祖国统一和德国人民幸福的未来的事业，掌握在德国人民自己的手中。
    德国人争取统一和平与自由联盟在班堡召开了竞选集会，该党代表普勒姆工程师在会上发表演说，他着重指出，阿登纳是和平解决德国问题、消除分裂和达成德国统一的主要障碍。当前的要求是达成全德协议。
    波恩集团为了想竭力保住自己的统治地位，动员了宣传人员和警察以阻挠进步党派的竞选运动，首先是阻挠共产党的竞选运动。当局收买了成群的法西斯分子，去到德国共产党、德国人争取统一和平与自由联盟和全德人民党进行集会的地方，用种种手段来破坏这些党派的集会。四日，前魏玛共和国总理约·维尔特在加尔斯卢合的集会上发表演说时，有一百多名法西斯匪徒在警察的直接纵容下捣乱会场。联邦议院议员海·雷纳在卡塞尔的德国共产党竞选集会上发表演说时，同样有成群挑衅者企图阻挠劳动人民听取共产党候选人的演说。
