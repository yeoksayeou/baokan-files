Xinhua News Agency, Tehran: The United States is stepping up its financial "aid" to the Iranian Zahedi government in order to infiltrate Iran more quickly.

    Iranian Deputy Prime Minister Amid Nuri announced that the US government has recently given the Iranian government $45 million in "emergency aid," as well as $23.4 million in this year's "Point Four Program" funds, $7 million in leftover funds from last year's "Point Four Program," and $20 million in "military aid," totaling nearly $100 million.
    A statement issued by the US President's "Summer White House" on the 5th revealed the purpose of US "aid" to Iran, saying that it hopes US aid "will help effectively and promptly use Iran's abundant resources," which blatantly revealed the United States' ambition to seize Iranian oil resources that were previously controlled by Britain.

    美国“援助”伊朗近一亿美元
    企图迅速夺取伊朗石油资源
   【新华社讯】德黑兰消息：美国正加紧给予伊朗萨希迪政府财政“援助”，以便更快地侵入伊朗。
    伊朗副首相阿米德·诺里宣布，美国政府最近已给予伊朗政府四千五百万美元的“紧急援助”，另外并给伊朗政府以今年的“第四点计划”拨款二千三百四十万美元、去年“第四点计划”的余款七百万美元，以及“军事援助”二千万美元，合计近一亿美元。
    美国总统的“夏季白宫”在五日发表的声明中透露美国“援助”伊朗的目的说，希望美国的援助“有助于有效地及早使用伊朗丰富的资源”，这就露骨地表示了美国夺取过去由英国控制的伊朗石油资源的野心。
