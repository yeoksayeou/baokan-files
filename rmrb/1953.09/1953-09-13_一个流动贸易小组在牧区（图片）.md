    A Mobile Trade Team in Pastoral Areas
    When the herdsmen of all ethnic groups on the pasture heard that the trade team was coming, many waited on the hills. An old herdsman, Umak, pointed to the hill ahead and said, "Look, they are already climbing the mountain!"
    Sometimes the trade team couldn't find the herdsmen, so they set up their own tents on the high mountains to stay.
    With the arrival of summer, the third mobile trade team dispatched by the Tekes County Trade Company of Xinjiang, crossed valleys and passed through forests to find herdsmen, purchase their products (livestock, wool, etc.), and transport tea, salt, cloth, tobacco, sugar and other materials to supply the needs of the herdsmen.

    Herdsmen are buying tea transported by the trade team.
    Herdsman Mursal brought a cow to sell to the trade team in exchange for daily necessities.
    Comrades of the trade team are cooking; the water is melted snow, and the firewood is branches picked up from the forest.
    Pargul bought floral fabric for two girls. She said, "My daughter is studying in the county town and I should choose a beautiful floral fabric to make a skirt for her."
    Pastoral woman Patina said, "No one wanted this kind of wool in the past, but now I can use it to exchange for daily necessities."
    After working in one place for a few days, the comrades of the trade team take their goods and go to another place to find herdsmen.
    The comrades of the trade team often visit the herdsmen to understand their requirements for the trade team. This old Kazakh woman, Su Yumuhan, said to the comrades of the trade team, "Can you bring some toys for my grandson?"
    After work, the comrades of the trade team seize the time to study ethnic policies and ethnic languages.

    一个流动贸易小组在牧区
    牧场上的各族牧民听说贸易小组来了，很多人在山头上等候着，老牧民乌马克指着前边山头说：“看哪，他们已经爬上山来了！”
    贸易小组有时找不到牧民，就在高山上自己搭帐房住宿。
    夏季来了，新疆特克斯县贸易公司派往牧区的第三流动贸易小组，越过山谷，穿过森林，去寻找牧民，收购牧民的产品（牲畜、羊毛等），并把茶、食盐、布、烟、糖等物资运去，供应牧民的需要。（本报记者　朱波摄）
    牧民在购买贸易小组运来的茶叶。
    牧民木尔沙里牵来一头牛，卖给贸易小组，换回日用品。
    贸易小组的同志在烧饭，水是溶化的雪，烧柴是从森林里拣来的树枝。
    帕尔古尔为两个女孩子买花布。她说：“我的女儿在县城读书，应该挑一块美丽的花布给她作裙子穿。”
    牧妇帕提娜说：“像这种羊毛过去是没有人要的，现在却可以用它换日用品了。”
    贸易小组的同志，在一个地方工作几天后，又带着货物，到另外一个地方去寻找牧民。
    贸易小组的同志经常访问牧民，了解他们对贸易小组的要求。这位柯族老太太苏玉木汗对贸易小组的同志说：“你们能不能给我的孙子带一些玩具来？”
    贸易小组的同志，在工作后，就抓紧时间学习民族政策和民族语言。
