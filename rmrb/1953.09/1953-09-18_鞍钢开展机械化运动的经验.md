Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Experience in Carrying Out the Mechanization Movement
Anshan City Federation of Trade Unions

I. From competitions to increase labor intensity to competitions to create new technologies and transform old equipment, combining labor with technology

In 1952, Anshan Iron and Steel Company launched a competition to propose rationalization suggestions, find shortcuts, and summarize and promote advanced experiences, and the workers' enthusiasm was very high. However, the methods at that time were basically to increase labor intensity and conduct physical competitions. However, labor intensity has a certain limit and cannot be sustained. Therefore, many workers became ill in the second and third quarters. In October, Zhang Mingshan of the Small Steel Rolling Mill, with the strong support of the leadership and the help of Soviet experts, successfully created the "anti-wrapping disc." From then on, in the Small Steel Rolling Mill and in all enterprises in Anshan City, a vigorous movement to mechanize production was launched.

In the past six months, the workers have been very enthusiastic in this movement. Everyone is thinking about mechanizing production to replace manual operation, reduce physical labor, and improve the working environment. This shows that this movement is welcomed by all employees and reflects their urgent needs.

At the same time, this movement is closely integrated with solving key production problems; it is a shift from generally proposing rationalization suggestions to concentrating the wisdom of all employees to solve key production problems; it is a development from past competitions that strengthened physical labor and sought shortcuts to competitions that combine labor with technology. It overcomes the past tendency of "thousands of shortcuts, but tasks are not completed" in the movement, and has important significance for transforming old enterprises and accelerating national economic construction.

II. It is necessary to attach importance to the transformation of production equipment in old enterprises

In the past six months, we have successfully created 299 mechanized equipment. Some of them were not successfully researched and tested by Japanese and American experts before liberation, but were successfully researched by liberated Chinese workers and technicians. This fully demonstrates the superiority of our social system, which infinitely unleashes the creative wisdom and grand power of the working class. At the same time, it also powerfully illustrates that we should break all concerns, believe in and rely on the wisdom of the working class, implement the principle of combining labor with technology, and actively transform the production equipment of existing enterprises. Our country is currently in a period of planned economic construction, and the state invests the main human and material resources in basic construction, which is absolutely necessary. Therefore, our production plants and mines should not adopt a passive attitude of waiting for the state to invest a large amount of money to increase equipment, but should give play to the creative talents of all employees to transform old enterprises, increase production, and accumulate more wealth for the country.

At present, the production equipment of most of our factories and mines has not been transformed. For example, the loading and unloading work of the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department, the calendering of the Medium Plate Factory, the ingot casting workshop of the Steelmaking Plant, the soaking furnace of the Primary Rolling Plant, the coking of the Chemical Plant, the ventilation and dust removal of the Concentrator and the mine, and many tasks of the basic construction department are still operated in a handicraft manner. The leading cadres of these departments should clearly recognize the importance of transforming the production equipment of old enterprises, strengthen the leadership of the mechanization movement, and vigorously transform existing equipment.

III. Strengthen rationalization suggestion work, implement the principle of combining labor with technology, and give play to the collective creation power

According to the development of the movement, it is crucial to improve and strengthen the rationalization suggestion organization, absorb old technical workers with creative talents and technologically advanced technical personnel, establish a technical leadership core with prestige among the masses; put forward topics related to the creation and improvement of mechanized equipment based on the key issues in production at different times, widely mobilize employees to put forward rationalization suggestions; implement the principle of combining labor with technology, and give play to the collective creation power of the working class to quickly research and implement various mechanization, which plays a decisive role in the development of the movement. This is one of the main experiences that has been proven by the Small Steel Rolling Mill. In this movement, various factories and mines have learned from this experience, successively improved and rectified the rationalization suggestion organization, reorganized the committee or group composed of leading cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, old technical workers, and advanced technical personnel, established various systems, and reviewed and discussed various suggestions in accordance with the principle of balanced production, adopting the method of "one person proposes, everyone studies," and finally decided by the factory director. When there are differences of opinion that cannot be resolved, a special study is conducted again at a technical meeting attended by old workers, or Soviet experts are consulted. In short, no small suggestion from employees is let go. Whenever a suggestion is adopted, the rationalization suggestion committee designates a special person to assist in drawing, budgeting materials, assisting in production, and making an experimental plan; in the research and experiment, any shortcomings are promptly put forward to the employees, calling on everyone to assist in the realization of the suggestion, to break through the key production problems in each period, and gradually realize the mechanization of the production process. These measures have greatly improved the creative enthusiasm of the masses of employees and effectively exerted the due role of the rationalization suggestion organization.

IV. Deeply carry out ideological education, improve the class consciousness of employees, and overcome various ideological obstacles

The entire process of the mechanization movement is a process of improving equipment technology, and it is also a process of advanced thinking defeating backward thinking. In the movement, we constantly conduct education on the prospects of the national construction plan to all employees, so that all employees realize that in order to build the motherland more beautifully, we must rely on the power of the working class itself to gradually realize national industrialization. In the movement, we focus on enlightening and cultivating the advanced thinking of old workers and technicians in various different types of work, which plays an important role in the smooth development of the entire movement. In the movement, there are roughly the following ideological situations among employees: Old technical workers still retain the influence they received in the old society, and generally have the idea of ​​valuing face, fearing "losing face" if they are not successful, and the individualistic thinking of "showing off their skills." Some of the technicians, when they encounter suggestions from workers that they have not learned in books, doubt that they will not be successful, so they dare not get involved, fearing that they will lose face if they are not successful; another part of the technicians have the idea of ​​aiming too high, and like to design a huge device based on books, and then hand it over to the workers to make. General skilled workers often stick to the old ways, thinking that this is how it has been for many years, and that mechanization of production will fundamentally change the operation method, fearing trouble, disliking it, and even fearing that it will affect their excess piece-rate wages during the experiment, so they are not active during the experiment. Units with better development of the movement are all due to the leaders' in-depth investigation of the employees' thinking, using various forms of publicity and agitation to educate the employees, cultivate typical examples, establish advanced thinking, use real people and real events to educate the employees and break the employees' various ideological obstacles, and seize the opportunity to commend and cultivate advanced workers and technicians. Especially for technicians, it is necessary to conduct regular and meticulous ideological work, fully carry out criticism and self-criticism, in order to form and consolidate the ideological foundation of the mechanization movement.

V. Learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with an open mind, and earnestly implement the suggestions of Soviet experts

In the movement, various factories and mines have had many creations and improvements. At the beginning of the research, the enterprise leaders, engineering and technical personnel, and workers were not very confident, and many were affirmed only after the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts. At the same time, in the process of research and experiment, Soviet experts put forward many valuable technical suggestions, and many creations were successful only after the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions. Soviet experts personally participated in research and inspection work, and enthusiastically provided technicians with various technical reference books. For example, the successful "anti-wrapping disc" export nozzle and the pushing groove of the steel pushing machine in the Small Steel Rolling Mill were successful after implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. Tang Fulin, the assistant engineer of the Thin Plate Factory, created the double lifting platform of the rolling mill, which was successful after the Soviet experts revised the original suggestion. The Engineering Team of the Mechanical Department conducted the major repair project of the No. 2 blast furnace under the personal guidance of Soviet experts from beginning to end. Soviet experts put forward eleven major construction suggestions related to mechanization, such as steel rope brick sending machine, brick grinding machine, oxygen manifold, and mobile lifting tray. This series of facts educated all employees more deeply each time, improved the ideological consciousness of the employees, and actively learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and earnestly implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts in the movement. This is one of the important factors for the great harvest of the entire movement.

VI. Existing problems

At present, there are still the following four problems in the mechanization movement of Anshan Iron and Steel:

1.  The leading cadres of some factories and mines do not have a clear enough understanding of the idea of ​​transforming old enterprises. Some mistakenly believe that the original production level of their units is too low to create and improve on the existing basis; or they believe that their units are already mechanized production and do not need to be improved; individual unit leaders are afraid of mechanization, believing that it is not "storming" and that it is better to use manual operation to "storm" and create a new record. Therefore, in these factories and mines, the movement has not yet been launched.

2.  In the research, production and experimentation process of mechanization initiatives, there is still a contradiction that cannot be closely coordinated with production. Some leading cadres are afraid of affecting production, and take the attitude of "rather not experiment than affect the completion of the national plan"; others take the attitude of "rather not complete the plan than experiment successfully." Both of these attitudes are one-sided, thus affecting the normal development of the movement.

3.  Factory management work has not kept up. For example, after the mechanization of certain production processes, the proper placement and deployment of surplus labor, the issue of ensuring that the original wages are not reduced, the issue of balanced production and the supply of raw materials, the issue of operating procedures and technical appraisal, etc. Some units have not solved this series of problems in a timely manner, hindering the development of the movement.

4.  Trade union work still has shortcomings, mainly manifested in: the summary and promotion of advanced experience is not done enough; rewards and commendations are not timely; there are shortcomings in the ideological education of employees, especially the ideological education of technicians is somewhat relaxed, and the technicians of some factories and mines have not been fully mobilized.

    鞍钢开展机械化运动的经验
    鞍山市总工会
    一、由提高劳动强度的竞赛，走向创造新技术、改造旧设备，使劳动与技术相结合的竞赛
    一九五二年，鞍山钢铁公司曾展开提合理化建议、找窍门、总结和推广先进经验的竞赛运动，工人的积极性非常高。但是，当时的做法基本上都是提高劳动强度，进行体力比赛。而劳动强度是有一定限度的，是不能持久的，所以在二、三季度中，工人累病的很多。十月份，小型轧钢厂张明山在领导方面大力支持和苏联专家的帮助下，创造“反围盘”成功了。从这以后，在小型轧钢厂，在全鞍山市各企业部门就轰轰烈烈地展开了使生产机械化的运动。
    半年来，在这个运动中，工人情绪非常饱满，大家都想法使生产机械化来代替人力操作，以减轻体力劳动，改善作业环境。这说明了，这个运动是为全体职工所欢迎的，反映了职工迫切的要求。
    这个运动同时是与解决生产中的关键问题密切结合着的；是由过去一般地提合理化建议走向集中全体职工的智慧解决生产中的关键问题；是由过去加强体力劳动、找窍门的竞赛发展到使劳动与技术相结合的竞赛。它克服了过去运动中“窍门千千万，任务完不成”的偏向，对改造旧企业，加速国家经济建设有重要的意义。
    二、必须重视改造旧企业的生产设备
    半年来，我们创造成功的二百九十九件机械化设备，有些是解放前日本和美国的专家们研究试验都没有成功的，而解放了的中国工人和技术人员研究成功了。这充分说明了我们的社会制度的优越性，它无限量地发挥了工人阶级的创造智慧和宏伟的力量。同时它也有力地说明了，我们应该打破一切顾虑，相信和依靠工人阶级的智慧，贯彻劳动与技术相结合的方针，来积极改造现有企业的生产设备。我们的国家目前处于有计划的经济建设时期，国家将主要的人力和物力都投资于基本建设方面，这是完全必要的。因此，我们生产厂矿不应该采取坐待国家大量投资来增加设备的消极态度，而应发挥全体职工的创造才能改造旧企业，增加生产，为国家积累更多的财富。
    目前我们大部分厂矿的生产设备还没有进行改造，像鞍钢运输部的装卸工作、中板厂的压延、炼钢厂的铸锭车间、初轧厂的均热炉、化工厂的炼焦、选矿厂和矿山的通风排尘，以及基本建设部门的很多工作，都还是手工业方式的操作，这些部门的领导干部应该明确认识改造旧企业生产设备的重要意义，加强对机械化运动的领导，大力进行现有设备的改造。
    三、加强合理化建议工作，贯彻劳动与技术相结合的方针，发挥集体主义的创造力量
    根据运动开展情况来看，健全与加强合理化建议组织，吸收有创造才能的老技术工人和思想先进的技术人员参加，建立在群众中有威信的技术领导核心；根据不同时期生产上的关键提出有关机械化设备创造改进的课题，广泛发动职工提出合理化建议；贯彻劳动与技术相结合的方针，发挥工人阶级集体主义的创造力量，迅速研究实现各项机械化，对运动的开展起着决定作用。这是小型轧钢厂已经证明了的主要经验之一。在这次运动中，各厂矿都学习了这一经验，先后健全与整顿了合理化建议组织，重新改组了由党、行政、工会、青年团领导干部、老技术工人和先进的技术人员参加的委员会或小组，建立了各种制度，按照平衡生产的原则，对各种建议进行审查讨论，采取“一人提出大家研究”的办法，最后由厂长决定。遇有意见分歧不能解决时，则在有老工人参加的技术会上再一次进行专门研究，或向苏联专家请教。总之，决不放过职工任何一个细小的建议。每当一个建议被采纳的时候，合理化建议委员会便指定专人协助制图，预算材料，协助制作，并作出试验计划；在研究试验当中，遇有缺点便及时向职工提出来，号召大家协助实现该项建议，来突破每个时期生产上的关键，逐步地实现生产过程的机械化。这些措施大大提高了职工群众的创造热情，切实地发挥了合理化建议组织应有的作用。
    四、深入进行思想教育，提高职工的阶级觉悟，克服各种思想障碍
    机械化运动的整个过程，是改进设备技术的过程，同时也是先进思想战胜落后思想的过程。在运动中，我们不断地向全体职工进行国家建设计划远景的教育，使全体职工认识到为了把祖国建设得更美好，就必须依靠工人阶级自己的力量，逐步实现国家工业化。在运动中着重启发、培养各个不同工种的老工人及技术人员的先进思想，对整个运动的顺利开展起着重要作用。在运动中，职工中大体有以下几种思想情况：老技术工人还残存着在旧社会中所受的影响，普遍存在着爱面子，不成功怕“丢人现眼”的思想和个人“露一手”的单干思想。技术人员中有些是遇到工人提出的建议是自己在书本上没有学到的时候，就怀疑不一定能成功，于是就不敢插手，怕一旦不成功时丢人；另一部分技术人员则存在好高骛远的思想，喜欢自己根据书本设计一套庞大的装置，然后交给工人去制作。一般熟练工人则往往墨守成规，认为多少年就是这样过来的，生产机械化就会根本改变操作方法，怕麻烦，嫌不顺手，甚至怕在试验当中影响自己得超额计件工资，因此在试验当中就不积极。运动开展较好的单位，都是由于领导上深入调查职工的思想，用各种不同的宣传鼓动形式向职工进行教育，培养典型，树立先进思想，以真人真事来教育职工和打破职工的各种思想障碍，抓紧表扬与培养先进的工人与技术人员。尤其是对技术人员，要进行经常的细致的思想工作，充分开展批评与自我批评，才能形成和巩固机械化运动的思想基础。
    五、虚心学习苏联先进经验，切实实行苏联专家建议
    在运动中，各厂矿有着许许多多的创造和改进。在开始研究时，我们的企业领导干部、工程技术人员和工人的心里是不大托底的，很多是经过苏联专家的热心指导，才被肯定下来。同时，在研究试验过程中，苏联专家提出了很多技术方面的宝贵建议，有许许多多的创造都是由于实行了苏联专家的建议才获得成功的。苏联专家亲自参加研究和检查工作，热心地供给技术人员各种技术参考书。如小型轧钢厂已经成功的“反围盘”出口咀子，推钢机的推钢槽，都是执行了苏联专家建议而后获得成功的。薄板厂的助理工程师汤富麟创造的轧钢机双重升降台，就是由苏联专家修改了原建议后而获得成功的。机械处工程队在大修二高炉工程中，自始至终都是在苏联专家亲自指导下进行的，苏联专家提出了钢绳送砖机、磨砖机、氧气汇流排、活动吊盘等十一件重大的有关机械化的施工建议。这一系列的事实，一次比一次更深刻地教育了全体职工，提高了职工的思想觉悟，在运动中都积极地学习苏联先进经验，认真地执行了苏联专家建议，这是整个运动所以取得巨大收获的重要因素之一。
    六、目前存在的问题
    目前，鞍钢的机械化运动还存在以下四个问题：
    一、部分厂矿的领导干部对改造旧企业的思想还不够明确。有的错误地认为本单位原有生产水平太低，不能在现有的基础上创造改进；或者认为本单位已经是机械化生产了，不需要再改进；个别单位的领导干部怕机械化，认为没有“突击”性，不如人力操作来个“突击”可以创个新纪录。因此，在这些厂矿中，运动还没有开展起来。
    二、在机械化创议的研究制作与试验过程中，还存在着与生产不能紧密配合的矛盾。有的领导干部怕影响生产，就采取了“宁肯不试验，也别影响国家计划的完成”的态度；还有的采取了“宁可完不成计划，也要试验成功”的态度。这两种态度都是片面的，因此影响到运动不能正常地开展起来。
    三、工厂管理工作没有跟上去。如某些生产过程机械化之后，剩余劳动力的适当安置调配，保证不降低原有工资的问题，均衡生产与原材料的供应问题，操作规程和技术鉴定的问题等。这一系列的问题，有些单位没有及时解决，阻碍了运动的开展。
    四、工会工作还存在着缺点，主要表现在：总结与推广先进经验做得不够；奖励表扬不及时；职工的思想教育工作还有缺点，特别是对技术人员的思想教育有些放松，有些厂矿的技术人员还没有充分发动起来。
