    Strive to Increase Production and Practice Economy to Guarantee Overfulfillment of the National Plan
    Shenyang City's Mechanical Factories Launch Competition
    [From our Northeast Correspondent] Shenyang City, the center of the nation's machine manufacturing industry, is seeing its mechanical factories launch a production increase and economy drive, with workers chanting the slogan: "Make a hundredfold effort to guarantee the overfulfillment or early completion of the first year's production tasks of the Five-Year Plan."
    In the two production increase and economy movements of 1951 and 1952, the machine manufacturing workers of Shenyang City made huge contributions to the country. They created wealth equal to 1,915,700 tons of grain, increased the variety of products manufactured to 480, and successfully shouldered the glorious task of "producing machines." This time, the mechanical system's employees are expressing their desire to use even greater efforts to guarantee the overfulfillment of the national plan.
    After the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called for a production increase and economy competition on July 14th, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the China Machine Manufacturing Workers' Union convened a meeting of member representatives on August 6th to mobilize the launch of the production increase and economy competition. At the meeting, the representatives all expressed their determination to guarantee the overfulfillment of the national plan. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the China Machine Manufacturing Workers' Union also organized a competition among workers of the same trade in the metal processing workshops of the mechanical system and convened a signing conference for the same-trade production increase and economy competition on August 19th. Now, each mechanical factory has plunged into the production increase and economy competition. The Heavy Machinery Plant put forward specific measures to guarantee the increase in production and saving of 68.4028 billion yuan of wealth for the country by the end of the year. The workers in each workshop of the plant are enthusiastically studying ways to tap potential. In July, the fitter group in Workshop One needed 360 hours to assemble a 400-kilogram air hammer. After everyone discussed and implemented professional division of labor and assembly line operations, it has now been shortened by 20 hours. Group C of the steelmaking open hearth furnace studied the Soviet experience of rapid steelmaking and produced a furnace of steel in six hours and seventeen minutes on August 5th. Recently, it has been shortened to five hours and forty-seven minutes, with a quality reaching one hundred percent. Mechanical Factory No. 6 decided to re-revise its original production increase and economy struggle plan on the basis of strengthening planned management. The factory's employees discovered various favorable conditions in production and made the following revisions to the originally planned production increase and economy plan: The total value of goods was revised to exceed the annual national plan by 14.6 percent; the total value of production was revised to exceed the annual national plan by 21.5 percent; labor productivity was revised to exceed the annual national plan by 20.7 percent; and the cost plan was revised to be 11.31 percent lower than the national plan. The employees of the Second Workshop of the Third Machine Tool Factory guaranteed that they would increase production of 33.5 lathes for the country in the second half of the year. In addition to proposing specific measures to ensure the improvement of output and quality, all the employees of the Third Workshop also proposed to increase the equipment utilization rate to 94 percent by October and guaranteed the elimination of machine tool and personal accidents. All the employees of the metalworking workshop of the Fifth Electrical Factory proposed to strengthen the quality responsibility system and inspection system, so that the average quality index would reach 99.7 percent by October. In order to ensure the improvement of the production balance rate, they also proposed to strengthen original records, supply raw materials in a timely manner, and strengthen dispatching work. Wang Mingxian's group of Mechanical Factory No. 6 used to be a group with lax labor discipline and backward production. After consolidating labor discipline education, the workers improved their awareness. This time, in discussing the production increase and economy plan, they earnestly studied advanced experience and tapped the potential in various aspects. For example, worker Qi Baoqing studied and improved the belt device and turret installation of the 2533 lathe, increasing the efficiency of the lathe by 50 percent. Other workers improved the water turbine drilling method, reducing waste products by more than 50 percent. All the workers in the group are full of confidence and decided to complete the group's production increase and economy struggle plan 27.5 days ahead of schedule.
    Now, the production increase and economy competition in various factories of the Shenyang City mechanical system is flourishing.

    努力增产节约保证超额完成国家计划
    沈阳市各机械厂展开竞赛
    【本报东北记者站讯】全国机器制造业中心——沈阳市的各机械厂展开了增产节约竞赛，工人们的口号是：“百倍努力保证超额或提前完成五年计划的第一年生产任务。”
    沈阳市机器制造业工人在一九五一年和一九五二年两次增产节约运动中，曾经对国家作了巨大的贡献，他们创造了价值一百九十一万五千七百吨粮食的财富，制造出的产品品种增加到四百八十种，胜利地担当了“出机器”的光荣任务。这次机械系统的职工们表示要用更大的努力来保证超额完成国家计划。
    中共沈阳市委在七月十四日号召开展增产节约竞赛后，中国机器制造业工会沈阳市委员会在八月六日召开了会员代表大会，动员开展增产节约竞赛。会上，代表们都表示要保证超额完成国家计划。中国机器制造业工会沈阳市委员会还组织了机械系统金属加工车间的同工种竞赛，并在八月十九日召开了同工种增产节约竞赛签字大会。现在，各机械厂纷纷投入增产节约竞赛中。重型机器厂提出具体措施，保证到年底为国家增产节约六百八十四亿零二十八万元的财富。该厂各车间工人热烈地研究挖潜力的办法，一车间钳工组七月份装配一台四百公斤空气锤，需要三百六十小时，经过大家讨论，实行专业分工，流水作业，现在已缩短了二十小时。炼钢平炉丙组学习苏联快速炼钢经验，八月五日用六小时十七分钟出了一炉钢，最近又缩短到五小时四十七分钟，质量达到百分之百。机械六厂决定在加强计划管理的基础上重新修订原来的增产节约奋斗计划。该厂职工发掘出生产上各种有利条件，把原订的增产节约计划作了如下的修改：商品总值修订为超过全年国家计划百分之十四点六；生产总值修订为超过全年国家计划百分之二十一点五；劳动生产率修订为超过全年国家计划百分之二十点七；成本计划修订为较国家计划降低百分之十一点三一。第三机床厂二车间职工，保证下半年要为国家增产三十三台半车床；三车间全体职工除了提出保证提高产量质量的具体办法外，还提出到十月份要使设备利用率达到百分之九十四，并保证消灭机床和人身事故。电工五厂金工车间的全体职工提出以加强质量责任制和检查制度等办法，使质量平均指标到十月份要达到百分之九十九点七。为了保证生产均衡率的提高，他们还提出了加强原始记录，及时供应原材料，以及加强调度工作等。机械六厂王明显小组曾经是一个劳动纪律松弛、生产落后的小组，经过巩固劳动纪律教育，工人们提高了觉悟。他们这次在讨论增产节约计划中，认真学习了先进经验，挖掘出各方面的潜力。例如工人齐宝清研究改进了二五三三车床的皮带装置和塔轮的安装，提高车床效率百分之五十。其他工人改进了水轮钻孔方法，使废品减少百分之五十以上。该小组全体工人充满信心，决定提前二十七天半完成小组增产节约的奋斗计划。
    现在，沈阳市机械系统各厂的增产节约竞赛正在蓬勃开展。
