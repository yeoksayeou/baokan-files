Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th Dispatch from TASS: As the West German election struggle enters a tense stage, Bonn's Minister of Interior, Lehr, publicly announced a series of measures aimed at undermining the election campaigns of the German Communist Party, the League of Germans for Unity, Peace and Freedom, the "All-German People's Party," and the "Liberal League." These police measures are among the many actions taken by Bonn's revanchists to intimidate democratic organizations.

The various reactionary parties within the Bonn government bloc are adopting all sorts of means to achieve the results they desire on election day, September 6th. Reports indicate that the Bonn police authorities have confiscated the election materials of some democratic parties, arrested people who were promoting the German Communist Party's election program, prohibited newspapers like the "New People's News" and "People's Echo," the organs of the Essen organization of the German Communist Party, from being published, and banned election rallies of various democratic parties and organizations. Lehr's police department condones fascists and participates in attacking the election activities of various democratic parties. For example, on August 8th, a group of fascist thugs massacred people participating in a German Communist Party rally in a certain residential area, and the police also participated in this incident. Josef Ledwohn, the First Secretary of the North Rhine-Westphalia State Committee of the German Communist Party and a candidate for the Federal Parliament, Kulu Gai, the secretary of a local organization of the German Communist Party, and many workers were seriously injured. In Brunswick, police used rubber batons to beat people participating in an election meeting.

According to newspaper reports, the judicial organs of the Adenauer government are also actively participating in undermining the election campaign of West Germany's patriotic and peaceful forces. Since the beginning of the election campaign, thousands of patriots have been arrested and imprisoned. The Dortmund Special Court sentenced peace fighters Paul Schneider, Bruno Heinemann, Johann Czambor, and Josef Kaiser to fifteen months in prison for distributing leaflets suggesting that the government and the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic hold all-German negotiations. A group of patriots such as Oskar Noman, Karl Dickan, Jupp Angenvoort, and other candidates for the Federal Parliament of the German Communist Party are still in prison. However, West Germany's patriotic forces, regardless of this persecution, are fighting the Bonn clique for a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 3rd Dispatch from German News Agency: Some Americans, using the Social Democratic Party's foreign policy program as a pretext, are openly interfering in the West German election campaign in order to save Adenauer's position at the last minute.

The Social Democratic Party's foreign policy program includes: convening a Four-Power Conference, mainly to reach an agreement on the "future status of Germany," establishing an all-German committee to prepare for universal elections in Germany, and this committee can only pass decisions on the basis of unanimous consent. After the universal elections are held, an all-German National Assembly and a German government should be established, and this government will be on an equal footing with other countries at the peace conference, etc. Eichler and Erler, members of the Executive Committee of the Social Democratic Party, also advocated Germany's participation in the United Nations.

According to the West German "Dimitag" news agency, American figures "see in the Social Democratic Party's program the possibility that the Social Democratic Party may depart from its current policy on certain foreign policy issues—not only for electoral tactical reasons." The news agency reported that American figures stated that they would not accept without opposition a federal government acting under the influence of the Social Democratic Party that would change West Germany's foreign policy. American figures also warned that if the promises made by Adenauer in the Bonn and Paris treaties could not be fulfilled, the result would be "the disintegration of the occupation status and its inevitable consequences for the Federal Republic," and if Adenauer's policy were changed, "it would be difficult to realize the economic loans granted to West Germany by the United States."

Before this threatening statement was issued, Adenauer had a meeting with U.S. High Commissioner to Germany Conant, who told Adenauer: "The U.S. government will not discuss with a government different from the current one the issues it has raised regarding the revision of the Bonn and Paris treaties."

    美国与西德反动派
    破坏西德民主党派竞选运动
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：正当西德竞选斗争进入紧张的阶段，波恩内政部长勒尔公开宣布了一些措施，旨在破坏德国共产党以及德国人争取统一和平与自由联盟、“全德人民党”和“自由主义联盟”的竞选运动，这些警察措施是波恩复仇主义者恫吓民主组织的许多行动中的一种。
    波恩政府集团内各反动党派正采取各种手段，以求在九月六日选举的一天达到他们所期望的结果。各报指出，波恩警察机关没收了一些民主党派的竞选材料，逮捕了宣传德国共产党竞选纲领的一些人，不准德国共产党埃森组织的机关报“新人民报”和“人民回声报”这样一些报纸出版，不准各民主党派和组织举行竞选集会。勒尔的警察局纵容法西斯分子并参加袭击各民主党派的竞选活动。例如，八月八日一批法西斯打手屠杀了参加德国共产党某居民点集会的人，警察也参与了这一事件，德国共产党北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州委员会第一书记、联邦议院议员候选人约瑟夫·莱德温，德国共产党地方组织的书记库鲁格伊和许多工人都受了重伤。在不伦瑞克，警察用橡皮棍殴打参加竞选大会的人。
    据报纸指出，阿登纳政府的司法机关也积极参加了破坏西德爱国的和平力量的竞选运动。自竞选运动开始以来就有上千爱国者被捕入狱。多特蒙德特别法庭判处和平战士帕乌尔·施奈德，布鲁诺·海涅曼，约翰·查姆鲍和约瑟夫·凯撒监禁十五个月，因为他们散发建议政府和德意志民主共和国人民议院举行全德谈判的传单。一批爱国者如奥斯卡·诺曼、卡尔·迪克安、尤普·安根福特及另外的德国共产党联邦议院议员候选人，直到现在还被关在监狱里。但是，西德的爱国力量不顾这些迫害，正对波恩集团进行斗争，以争取一个统一、民主与和平的德国。
    【新华社讯】据德意志通讯社波恩三日讯：某些美国人以社会民主党的外交政策纲领为藉口，正在公开地干涉西德选举运动，以便在最后一分钟挽救阿登纳的地位。
    社会民主党关于外交政策的纲领包括：召开四大国会议，主要地就“德国未来的地位”达成协议，成立一个全德委员会以便在德国准备举行普遍选举，这个委员会只能在一致同意的基础上通过决定。在举行普遍选举之后应成立全德国民议会及一个德国政府，这个政府在和平会议上将与其他国家处于平等地位等。社会民主党执行委员会委员埃希勒和艾尔勒并主张德国参加联合国。
    据西德“迪米塔格”新闻社报道，美国人士从社会民主党的纲领中“看出社会民主党有可能在有关外交政策的某些问题上离开它当前的方针——不仅是为了选举策略的原因。”该通讯社报道，美国人士表示，他们不会不加反对地接受一个在社会民主党的影响下行事的联邦政府，这个政府将改变西德的外交政策。美国人士并警告说，如果阿登纳在波恩和巴黎条约中所作的诺言不能实现的话，结果将是“占领状态的瓦解及其对于联邦共和国的不可避免的后果”，如果阿登纳政策改变了的话，“美国给予西德经济贷款的事就难以实现了”。
    在这个威胁性的声明发表之前，阿登纳与美国驻德高级专员康南特曾进行过一次会谈，康南特告诉阿登纳：“美国政府不会与一个不同于现政府组成的政府讨论它所提出的修改波恩与巴黎条约的问题。”
