Following Beijing and Tianjin, Wuhan and Guangzhou are also taking concrete measures to address the enrollment issues for elementary school graduates.

The Wuhan Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee convened an expanded meeting on September 3rd to discuss issues related to elementary school graduates' enrollment. In the early days after Liberation, Wuhan had only over 50,000 elementary school students. By the end of 1952, this number had grown to over 130,000. During this period, the number of middle school students also increased from 7,000 to over 17,000. This is an encouraging phenomenon reflecting the increased cultural aspirations of the broad masses after their liberation. However, the number of teachers and facilities has not kept pace with the growth of students, and despite expanded enrollment in middle schools across the city, the demand for enrollment from this year's elementary school graduates cannot be met. After studying the above situation, the Consultative Committee believes that this is a difficulty encountered in China's development, and it is necessary, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, to mobilize all sectors of society, students, and students' parents to work together to overcome this difficulty.

The Consultative Committee agreed with the following measures proposed by the Wuhan Municipal Education Bureau based on the instructions of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and in conjunction with local conditions: Regarding the handling of elementary school graduates: 1. Appropriately increase the enrollment quota for the first year of junior high school without affecting teaching; 2. Middle schools that did not implement a two-shift system last year due to insufficient conditions should implement a two-shift system as much as possible to increase the number of two-shift classes; 3. If a classroom and dormitory can be arranged near each school, some students can also be admitted. Students who still cannot enroll after taking the above measures: (1) Factories and enterprises are requested to vigorously recruit older elementary school graduates as apprentices. It would be even better if factories and enterprises could run their own primary technical schools. At the same time, improve the teaching in vocational schools throughout the city, such as accounting and typing schools, to absorb older elementary school graduates. (2) Organize self-study for younger students with poor grades on a voluntary basis, with teachers designated by the original school to provide guidance, preparing them to take the exam next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou. August 28th. The Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Education Bureau convened a meeting of representatives from some middle and primary school principals, educational unions, and other relevant units. In accordance with the spirit of the People's Daily editorial "Solving the Elementary School Graduates' Enrollment Problem Realistically," the meeting discussed ways to increase student enrollment: 1. Increase the number of classes in some public and private middle schools with relatively spacious school buildings; 2. Increase the number of students per class from 50 to 60 in public and private middle schools with large classrooms; 3. Schools that have not opened a two-shift system should consider opening a two-shift system; the teachers needed to increase student enrollment will mainly be promoted from public and private primary school teachers and transferred from technical school teachers, and any shortfall will be selected from unemployed intellectuals and transferred from government cadres. These measures will solve the enrollment problem for some elementary school graduates. Currently, the Guangzhou Municipal Education Bureau has postponed the date of announcing the results of the first-year junior high school entrance exam to consider admitting candidates whose scores in major subjects such as Chinese and mathematics are close to the admission standard.

The number of elementary school students transferring schools in Wuhan this summer is higher than in previous years. Especially in industrial areas, the number of children of workers or cadres from other places is very large, while the number of classes in local schools is limited, making it impossible to accommodate them. Some students are required to transfer to other schools due to job transfers or relocation of their parents. However, individual schools overemphasize "standardization" in dealing with student transfer issues, failing to properly resolve the issue based on actual circumstances, causing students' parents to search for schools everywhere, resulting in great dissatisfaction. There are also individual students who do not need to transfer schools but request to transfer in order to "go to a good school." According to preliminary statistics from the Jianghan District of the city, 365 elementary school students were transferred from within the city, 735 were transferred from other places, and 150 were transferred from government organizations. Therefore, elementary school transfer work has encountered great difficulties.

The Wuhan Municipal Education Bureau has now instructed each district to appropriately resolve this issue based on the actual situation. First, resolve the issue of student transfers within the city: All students who must transfer schools due to job transfers or other special difficulties of their parents will be resolved by each district in a unified manner.

Second, regarding the transfer of students from other places, handle it according to the following circumstances: 1. If the number of children of workers or cadres from factories, enterprises, and other units is very large and the schools in the area cannot accommodate them, actively suggest and assist the unit in preparing to run a primary school for their children (if the number of people is small and the school has vacancies, they should be placed); 2. Students transferring from other places who do not fall into the above categories can register with the local district government (the registration deadline is September 3rd), and will be placed as much as possible based on the actual situation of the school in the district. If it is still not possible to resolve all cases, other solutions will be found later.

In order to ensure that students transferring schools do not lose their schooling, the Wuhan Municipal Education Bureau also instructed each district to do a good job in ideological mobilization, explaining to school teachers that, under today's circumstances, "standardization" should not be overemphasized (such as some schools emphasizing the principle of 45 students per class, and that more will affect teaching). The realistic problem of students dropping out of school should be considered first. Students and parents should also be told that if there are no special difficulties, they should not transfer schools for the time being, so as to avoid the phenomenon of some schools being too crowded and some schools being too loose.

In order to enable each school to earnestly do a good job in enrollment and transfer work, the Wuhan Municipal Education Bureau decided to postpone the elementary school opening date to September 8th, with classes starting on the same day (originally scheduled to open on September 1st, with formal classes starting on the 7th).

    武汉和广州积极解决小学毕业生升学问题
    武汉市教育局指示各区适当地解决小学生转学问题
    继北京、天津两地之后，武汉、广州市也采取具体措施解决小学毕业生升学问题。
    武汉市各界人民代表会议协商委员会九月三日召开了扩大会议，对有关小学毕业生升学问题作了讨论。解放初期，武汉全市小学生只五万多人，到一九五二年年底已发展到十三万多人。在这时期中，中学生也由七千人发展到一万七千多人。这是广大人民翻身后文化要求提高的令人兴奋的现象。但目前师资和设备赶不上学生发展的需要，全市中学虽扩大招生，仍不能满足本届小学毕业生的升学要求。协商委员会研究了上述情况，认为这是我国发展中遇到的困难，必须在共产党和人民政府的领导下，动员社会各阶层人民、学生和学生的家长，共同努力来克服这个困难。
    协商委员会同意武汉市教育局根据中央人民政府教育部指示并结合当地情况提出的以下一些办法：在处理小学毕业生方面：一、在不影响教学的原则下，适当增加初中一年级招生名额；二、去年因条件不足未实行二部制的中学，尽可能推行二部制，以增加二部制的班次；三、在各校附近如能解决一部教室、宿舍，也可以增收些学生。采取以上办法后，仍不能升学的学生：（一）拟请各工厂企业部门大力招收小学毕业生中年纪较大的作学徒。各工厂、企业如能自办初级的技术学校更好。同时改进全市职业性的学校如会计、打字等学校的教学，使之吸收年龄较大的小学毕业生。（二）年龄小、成绩差的学生，在自愿原则下组织自学，由原校指定教师辅导，准备明年参加考试。
    广州市人民政府教育局八月二十八日召集了部分中、小学校长、教育工会和其他有关单位的代表，根据人民日报社论“实事求是地解决小学毕业生升学问题”的精神，讨论了增招学生的办法：一、在一部分校舍较宽广的公、私立中学增加班次；二、在教室大的公、私立中学，把每班学生数目从五十人增加到六十人；三、没有开两部制的学校，酌量开设两部制；因增加学生而需要增加的师资，主要从公、私立小学教师中提升和从技术学校教师中抽调，不足的再从失业知识分子中挑选和从机关干部中抽调。用这些办法，将可解决一部分小学毕业生的升学问题。目前，广州市教育局已将初中一年级考生发榜日期延迟，准备补取语文、数学等主要科目考试成绩接近录取标准的考生。（新华社）
    武汉市今年暑期转学的小学学生，较往年为多；尤其是工业区域，外来的工人或干部子弟数量很大，而当地学校班次有限，无法容纳。有些学生因家长工作调动或搬家，要求转往他校学习；而个别学校对学生转学问题，过分强调“正规化”，未能根据实际情况予以妥善解决，以致学生家长到处找学校，引起极大的不满。也有个别学生可以不转学，但为了“上好学校”而要求转学。据该市江汉区初步统计，由市内转入的小学生有三百六十五人，外地转入的有七百三十五人，机关转入的有一百五十人。因此，小学转学工作已发生很大困难。
    武汉市教育局现已根据实际情况，指示各区适当地解决这一问题。首先解决市内学生转学的问题：凡学生因家长工作调动或其他特殊困难必须转学的，由各区统一掌握解决。
    其次，关于外来学生的转学问题，根据下列情况处理：一、工厂、企业等单位的工人或干部子弟，如数量很大，该地区学校又无法容纳，应积极建议并协助该单位筹办子弟小学（如人数少，学校又有空额时要予以安插）；二、不属于上述情况的外地转学生，可到当地区政府登记（登记日期限九月三日截止），根据该区学校实际情况尽量予以安插，若仍不能全部解决，以后另想办法。
    为了保证不使转学学生失学，武汉市教育局并指示各区要作好思想动员工作，对学校教师说明，在今天的情况下不能过分强调“正规化”（如有的学校强调四十五人一班的原则，多了会影响教学工作等）。应首先考虑学生失学的现实问题。对学生和家长，也要讲明，如没有特殊困难，可以不转学的就暂时不要转学，以免发生有些学校过挤，有些学校过松的现象。
    为了使各校能够认真作好招生和转学工作，武汉市教育局决定将小学开学日期延至九月八日，开学后即日上课（原定九月一日开学，七日正式上课）。
