    Overwhelmingly Disastrous Statistical Reporting Forms
    Si Gengsheng
    Investigation and statistics are important tools for national construction, especially for the implementation of planned management. Therefore, after the start of planned economic construction, all parties have attached particular importance to investigation and statistical work. However, due to the failure to overcome subjectivism, decentralism, and bureaucratism in investigation and statistical work—and the failure to adequately consider the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy in rural areas—some serious adverse consequences have arisen in the course of work, which must be quickly corrected.
    
    Too Many Types of Statistical Forms
    The excessive, complex, and chaotic issuance of investigation and statistical reports has become a widespread phenomenon. Rural cadres, in particular, feel that statistical forms are overwhelmingly disastrous. In the past, almost every campaign and every task had its own reporting forms. The issuing agencies ranged from the central government to the district and township levels. According to a survey in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, there were as many as 31 issuing agencies below the county level, including various sections and bureaus of the county people's government, mass organizations such as women's and youth leagues, the Marriage Law Implementation Committee, and Xinhua Bookstore. Each unit issued many types of forms, and many of these forms had more than one sheet. In Yuci County, Shanxi Province, four units issued more than 300 types of forms from January to March 1953. The Shanxi Provincial Finance Committee issued four sets of forms, including the "Agricultural Production Gross Output Value and Labor Employment Statistics," totaling 74 sheets, and one set of agricultural census forms with 28 types. Some agricultural production forms were even sent directly to farmers to fill out. According to an inspection by the Liaodong Provincial Statistics Bureau, in the third quarter of 1952, 11 provincial-level units, 21 county-level cities, and five districts and towns in the province issued 316 types of investigation and statistical forms on their own, including 11 daily reports, two tri-daily reports, 31 five-daily reports, 31 ten-daily reports, 89 monthly reports, 31 quarterly reports, five semi-annual reports, eight annual reports, and 108 one-time surveys. Among them, 145 types were sent to districts and villages for completion. In 1952, the province arranged 12 types of regular reports in the agricultural field alone. Since last spring, the Lv Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Juxian County, Shandong Province, has received 255 types of reporting forms issued by various levels, and currently, 61 types are still backlogged and have not been filled out.
    
    There are also many reporting forms for urban private industrial and commercial enterprises. A flour mill in Xi'an City received more than 120 types of reporting forms last year. According to an inspection by the Liaodong Provincial Statistics Bureau, 29 types of monthly and quarterly reports for private businesses were arranged in 1952.
    
    Independent Arrangements, Mutual Duplication
    Due to the lack of coordination among various departments at the higher levels, grassroots units often receive multiple sets of reporting forms from various leading agencies. The Finance Committee of a certain special district arranged for the counties to submit semi-monthly reports on public and private purchases and sales. Subsequently, the Provincial Department of Commerce arranged for monthly reports on private commercial purchases and sales. Then, the Provincial Finance Committee arranged for ten-daily reports on the proportion of public and private sectors. Although the purpose was the same, the forms and submission times were different, so the county industrial and commercial sections had to prepare three different reports for the same data. The rural finance section, currency management section, and planning section of the Songjiang Central Branch of the People's Bank of China in Jiangsu Province often received reporting forms with the same content arranged by various departments of the provincial branch at the same time. As a result, the three sections often went to various state-owned specialized companies to request figures separately. On one occasion, comrades from the three sections ran into each other at a company and realized that they were all there for the same figures. The Agricultural and Forestry Section of Haidian District, Beijing, issued 44 types of forms to various villages from January to October last year, including those from the central and North China agricultural and forestry departments, the Municipal Agricultural and Forestry Bureau and its affiliated sections, and the District People's Government and its Agricultural and Forestry Section. Many of these forms were largely similar in content and duplicated each other. There were five types of forms for investigating the mutual aid and cooperation movement alone: one issued by the central agricultural department, one issued by the Municipal Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, and three issued by the District People's Government, with basically the same content. According to an inspection in Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, among the 104 types of agricultural reporting forms, there were a total of 759 "items" and 1,692 "sub-items." Among the 759 "items," 658 "items" were duplicated, with the most duplicated item appearing 44 times. The duplication of "sub-items" was even more extensive.
    
    Complex Content, Broad Scope
    The complexity and variety of the reporting form content are truly astounding. It is well known that health agencies want to collect statistics on the number of mosquitoes, flies, and rats eliminated. The childcare survey form issued by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Public Health includes seven major categories and 87 columns, even asking about what games children play and whether they touch their mother's breasts when sleeping. Ziwu Village in Dingxian County, Hebei Province, received a statistical form from the higher authorities called "Comparison of Agricultural Tax Land Yield," which required filling in 80 mu numbers, 80 yield numbers, 80 average yield numbers, and 80 percentages, totaling 320 numbers. There was also a ten-day propaganda network statistics form for drought prevention and spring plowing with 126 indicator numbers. Although drought prevention and spring plowing only lasted for ten days, it was difficult to complete these propaganda reporting forms even with three or five weeks of concentrated effort. The set of 28 agricultural census forms issued by the Shanxi Provincial Finance Committee had 303 items, 465 columns, and 114 instructions, totaling more than 10,000 words, requiring each farmer to answer "83 questions." Juxian County, Shandong Province, needed to collect statistics on the number of trees in each village, the age of the trees, the types of chickens, and their ages. The livestock and veterinary survey form in Weinan, Shaanxi Province, was divided into 13 categories, including horses, mules, donkeys, camels, cattle, buffaloes, goats, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, and bees. Each category was further divided into six columns: original, increase, purchase, sale, death, and existing. Each column was then divided into four sub-items: male, female, breeding, and castrated. It was necessary to go through more than 300 procedures to fill out this form properly.
    
      Currently, many of the reporting forms in rural areas are clearly unnecessary and meaningless. According to the preliminary review of 24 types of agricultural forms collected in Dingxian County, only one was fully usable, six were partially usable, and the other 17 were completely useless and even harmful. These 24 types of forms had a total of 1,567 columns, of which only 174 were useful. Even if these forms were filled out without any errors, only about 10 percent of the material would be useful, and about 90 percent would only increase the burden on farmers and cadres.
    
      Industrial and commercial reporting forms also have similar situations. For example, the Market Management Office of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce arranged for private factories to submit a "Commodity Production, Sales, and Price Survey Form," requiring each enterprise to separately report the production and sales situation, price profit margin, and percentage (divided into public and private sectors) for different trademarks and specifications of commodities in each quarter of the pre-war, post-war, and 1949-1952 periods, as well as the percentage of four sales methods (retail, wholesale, salesperson, special contract) and the percentage of eight sales targets (local wholesalers, local retailers, out-of-town, peddlers, exclusive sales, acquisitions, orders, processing). As a result, most factories were unable to fill out the form, and the few who filled it out left most of it blank. According to an inspection by the Liaodong Provincial Statistics Bureau, the monthly and quarterly reports for private businesses arranged in 1952 covered everything from stationary merchants, traveling merchants, exchanges, brokers to peddlers. Among them, the income statement for stationary merchants was divided into eight major categories and 54 indicators, and the expense item alone was further divided into 23 indicators, including employee salaries, food, welfare, delivery, travel expenses, insurance, rent, repairs, depreciation, packaging, electricity and water, bad debts, payments, discounts, and miscellaneous expenses. As a result, it was simply impossible to implement.
    
    Other examples include the cultural department requiring each theater to report "audience composition," and the higher-level bank requiring the lower-level bank to report "savings targets," all of which are difficult to achieve.
    
    Filing Deadline, As Urgent As a Shooting Star
    Many reporting forms have a deadline of 20 days or half a month for submission, and some even have deadlines of five days, two days, or even the same day. Some forms are forwarded through various levels, and by the time the forms reach the reporting unit, the deadline has already passed. For example, the pest and disease prevention survey form in Qingyang County, Gansu Province, stipulated that the district government should fill it out by July 2nd, but the form did not reach the Maling District until July 13th. The spring sowing area survey form stipulated that it should be submitted by April 30th, but in the Maling District, it was not distributed to the township until mid-July. The investigation form for government agencies and schools issued by the East China Cultural and Educational Committee on January 21, 1953, had a deadline of January 26th, so each unit had to work overtime overnight to rush to complete it. Working overtime to rush statistical figures has become commonplace in many statistical departments. Due to the pressure of tight deadlines, reporters cannot cope and have to randomly estimate and report, and the higher levels believe it to be true. This phenomenon of "forced confession and belief" is also very common.
    
      Serious Adverse Consequences
    Due to the chaos of reporting forms, serious adverse consequences have already been caused. The main manifestations are in the following aspects:
    
    First, the masses are very dissatisfied, and the credibility of the government and many leading agencies has been damaged, and the work enthusiasm of cadres has also been harmed. Some of the reporting forms have unclear purposes; some are overly trivial, unnecessary, or have excessive demands, making them impossible to complete; some are even absurd, inexplicable, or even violate policies, causing political errors. These types of reporting forms not only increase a lot of unnecessary trouble for the masses, but also cause some undue concerns and ideological confusion among the masses. The masses reflect: "When there is nothing to do after eating, they come to make trouble," "The government wants to manage everything, even the number of lice and bedbugs that are caught," "Flies and mosquitoes are easy to kill, but counting them is difficult."
    
    So many reporting forms in the countryside are pressing down on the heads of rural cadres, making it difficult to cope with them. They are often troubled by the reporting forms. People reflect: "Township cadres run all over the streets for statistical forms," "Township cadres go to the countryside with a basket of statistics," "Cadres are easy to be, forms are difficult to handle; the work is done well, but the forms are overwhelming," "District and village cadres are in a dilemma, they are criticized by superiors for not completing tasks, and the masses oppose forced orders." Some cadres have to take measures to delay, suppress, or fabricate because of the tight deadlines and the high demands of superiors. Some reflect: "A lot of debt is not a concern, a lot of lice are not itchy, a lot of forms are not dealt with"; some reflect: "The superiors force us to report, so we have to make up random numbers."
    
    Second, it causes a great waste of manpower and material resources. In Heilongjiang Province, the budget for printing farmer account books alone is as high as 1.3 billion yuan (not approved), and if it is printed and distributed, the labor cost will be difficult to calculate. According to the East China Democratic Women's Federation, the "Statistics Form on the Number of Women Participating in Mutual Aid Groups and Agricultural Production Cooperatives" issued by the federation (this form was never reported after it was issued) wasted more than 1.3 billion yuan. This money could build seven nurseries that can accommodate 100 children, allowing hundreds of mothers to be freed from the burden of children and participate in production. Many reporting forms are never reported after they are issued, and many reporting forms are useless even if they are reported, wasting money and resources. If we calculate the waste of this manpower and material resources nationwide, it must be very alarming.
    
    Third, it affects the completion of important statistics. Due to the proliferation of various reporting forms, not only are the necessary ones not obtained, but even the most needed data cannot be reported. According to the results of the report inspection in Lintong County, only one-fifth of the reports need to be filled out, and the other four-fifths of the energy is taken up by reports that should not be filled out.
    
    Fourth, it causes confusion in statistical figures. The same question is reported to this agency with one number, and to that agency with another number. Each system and department has its own numbers, which contradict each other and are confusing. Most of the forced reports are unreliable, and not only do they not help the work, but they are often harmful.
    
    Now, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has issued the "Instructions on Cleaning Up the Current Investigation and Statistical Forms and Prohibiting the Random Issuance of Investigation and Statistical Forms." This chaotic situation in investigation and statistical work must not be allowed to continue. It is hoped that governments at all levels and various business departments will earnestly implement these instructions and resolutely eliminate the chaotic state in investigation and statistical work.

    泛滥成灾的调查统计表
    司更生
    调查统计是国家建设，特别是实行计划管理的一个重要工具；因此在有计划的经济建设开始后，各方面都特别重视调查统计工作。但由于调查统计工作中的主观主义、分散主义、官僚主义未能及时克服——在农村中未很好照顾小农经济的特点，因此在工作进行中产生了一些严重的恶果，必须迅速纠正。
    统计表的种类太多
    调查统计报表发得过多、过繁、过乱，已成普遍现象。乡村干部尤其感到统计表格泛滥成灾。过去，每个运动，每项工作几乎均有报表。发表机关上至中央下至区乡。据浙江省萧山县检查，仅县级以下的发表机关就有县人民政府各科、局，妇女、青年等群众团体，贯彻婚姻法委员会，新华书店等三十一个单位之多。而每个单位又发许多种表格。而许多种表格，每种还不止一张。山西省榆次县四个单位，一九五三年一至三月份共发表格三百多种。山西省财委所发“农业生产总值及劳动就业统计”等四套表格共七十四张，农业普查表一套二十八种，有些农业生产表格，并直接发到农户填报。据辽东省统计局检查一九五二年第三季内该省省属十一个单位、二十一个县市和五个区镇自行颁发的调查统计表格有三百一十六种，计日报十一种、三日报二种、五日报三十一种、旬报三十一种、月报八十九种、季报三十一种、半年报五种、年报八种、一次调查一百零八种，其中发到区村填报的一百四十五种；该省一九五二年内只在农业方面就布置了十二种定期报表。山东莒县吕鸿宾农业生产合作社自去春以来接到层层颁发的报表二百五十五种，目前还积压六十一种未填。
    城市私营工商业报表也不少。西安市某面粉厂去年一年内收到一百二十多种报表。辽东省据统计局检查，一九五二年布置的私营商业月、季报表就有二十九种。
    各自布置，互相重复
    由于上级各部门间互不联系各发报表，基层单位往往接到各级领导机关的数套报表。某专区财委向各县布置了公私购销半月报，继之省商业厅又布置了私营商业购销月报，接着省财委又布置了公私比重旬报，虽然目的相同，但由于表式及报送时间不同，县工商科上报同一个资料不得不作三种不同的报表。中国人民银行江苏省松江中心支行农村金融股、货币管理股、计划股往往同时接到省分行各部门所布置同样内容的报表，结果三个股常常分别到各个国营专业公司去要数字，有一次三个股的同志在一个公司碰了头，才知道都是为一个数字来的。北京海淀区农林科在去年一月至十月发给各村的表格四十四种，其中有中央和华北农林部门的，有市农林局及其所属各科的，有区人民政府及其农林科的，这些表格很多是大同小异，内容重复。单是调查互助合作运动情况的表格就有五种：中央农业部门发的一种、市农林局发的一种、区人民政府发的三种，内容基本上相同。另据陕西临潼县检查，在一百零四种农业报表中共有七百五十九个
  “项”和一千六百九十二个“目”，在七百五十九个
  “项”中有六百五十八个“项”是重复的，重复最多的项达四十四次。“目”的重复则更多。
    内容繁杂，范围太广
    报表内容要求之繁杂，花样之多，真是无奇不有，实属惊人。卫生机关要统计消灭蚊子、苍蝇、老鼠的数字，已是众所周知的了。北京市公共卫生局颁发的育儿法调查表包括七大项八十七栏，连小孩子作何玩耍，睡眠时是否摸着母亲的乳房等等都要调查填报。河北省定县子位村接到上级发来的有一张名为“农业税土地产量比较”的统计表，共需填八十个亩数，八十个产量数，八十个平均产量数和八十个百分比，共三百二十个数字。还有防旱春耕突击旬宣传网统计表共有一百二十六个指标数字。虽然防旱春耕仅仅突击一旬，而填报这些宣传情况的报表突击三旬甚至五旬也难完成。山西省财委发的农业普查表一套二十八种，有三百零三项，四百六十五栏，填表说明一百十四条，长万余言，要求每个农民都要解答“八十三问”。山东省莒县要统计各村有多少棵树，树龄几年；鸡的种类及其年龄。陕西省渭南畜牧兽医情况调查表分马、骡、驴、驼、黄牛、水牛、山羊、绵羊、猪、鸡、鸭、鹅、蜂等十三项，每项又分原有、增殖、买入、卖出、死亡、现有等六栏，每栏又分公、母、种用、骟等四个小目，必须经过三百多道手续才能填好这张表。
      目前农村的报表显然有很多是不需要和毫无意义的。据定县收集到二十四种农业表格的初步审查，只有一种完全可用，六种部分可用，另十七种根本无用而且有害。二十四种表格共一千五百六十七栏，有用者仅为一百七十四栏。这些表格即使填得一无差错，也仅有百分之十左右的材料有用，百分之九十左右是徒增农民与干部的负担。
      工商业报表亦有类似情况。如上海市工商局市场管理处向私营工厂布置了一种“商品产销价格情况调查表”，要求各企业将不同商标、不同规格的商品分战前、战后及一九四九年至一九五二年逐年各季的产销情况、价格利润幅度及其百分比（分公私），四种销售方式（门市、批发、推销员、特约）的百分比，八种销售对象（本埠批发商、本市零售商、外埠、行商、包销、收购、订购、加工）百分比，填表上报。结果大部分厂无法填报，少数填报的也是大部空白。据辽东省统计局检查一九五二年布置的私营商业月、季报表，从座商、行商、交易所、经纪人到摊贩都布置了月、季报表，其中座商所得额报表分八大项五十四个指标，仅各项费用支出一项就又分为职工工薪、伙食、福利、送货、旅费、保险、租赁、修理、折旧、包装、灯水煤、贷账、付账、折扣、杂费等二十三个指标，结果是根本行不通。
    其他又如文化部门要各剧场填报“观众成分”，上级银行要下级银行填报“储蓄对象”等等，都是难以作到的。
    填报限期，急如星火
    许多报表是限二十天、半月上报，个别有规定五天、两天，甚至也有限当天上报的。更有些经过层层转发，表格到填报单位时已经过了限期。如甘肃省庆阳县病虫害防治调查表，规定区政府七月二日填报，而表格发到马岭区时已是七月十三日。春季播种面积调查表，规定四月三十日上报，但在马岭区发到乡上时已到七月中旬。华东文教委员会一九五三年一月二十一日发出的机关学校调查表，限期一月二十六日前完成，于是各单位就连夜加班进行突击。为赶统计数字加班、加点来突击，在许多统计部门已经常化了。由于逼着限期快报，填报者无法应付，只好随便一估乱报，上面也就信以为真；这种“逼供信”的现象，亦很普遍。
      严重的恶果
    由于报表的混乱，已经造成了严重的恶果。主要表现在以下几个方面：
    一、首先是群众很不满意，并且已经损害到政府和许多领导机关的威信，还伤害了干部的工作积极性。报表中有些是目的不明确；有些是过分琐细，没有必要，或者要求过高，没有可能；有些则是十分荒唐，莫明其妙，甚至违犯政策，造成政治性的错误。这类报表不仅增加了群众很多不必要的麻烦，而且引起群众一些不应有的顾虑和思想混乱。群众反映是：“吃了饭没事干，就来找麻烦”，“政府什么都要管，连捉多少虱子、臭虫也要管了”，“苍蝇、蚊子好打，就是数数困难”。
    乡村中这样多的报表压到乡村干部的头上，实在难以应付，他们常常为报表苦恼。人们反映：“乡干满街跑，为了统计表”、“乡干下乡，统计一筐”，“干部好当，表格难挡；工作搞得好，表格吃不消”，“区村干部两头作难，完不成任务上级批评，强迫命令群众反对”。若干干部因时间紧迫和上级要求太高，难以完成任务，就只好采取拖压或捏造的办法。有的反映：“债多不愁，虱多不痒，表多不理”，“能压就压，不催不报”；有的反映：“上面逼着要，只好瞎乱造”。
    二、造成人力物力的极大浪费。黑龙江省仅农户台账一项的印刷费预算即达十三亿元之多（未批准），如果印发下去，所费的劳动力将难以计算。另据华东民主妇女联合会估计，该会所发“妇女参加互助组农业生产合作社人数统计表”（此表发下后，从未上报），仅费用就浪费人民币十三亿余元。这笔钱可办能容一百个孩子的托儿所七个，可使数百个母亲解除孩子的牵累而参加生产。有很多报表发下后根本未上报，很多报表虽然上报了，但根本无用，白费钱财，如将全国范围内的这项人力物力的浪费计算起来，一定是十分惊人的。
    三、影响了重要统计的完成。由于各种报表的充斥，不仅应该要的得不到，而且连最需要的资料也报不上来。据临潼县报表检查的结果，有必要填报的报表不过五分之一，此外五分之四的力量被不该填报的报表占去。
    四、造成了统计数字的混乱。同一个问题报给这个机关一个数字，报给那个机关又一个数字，各系统各部门各有各的数字，互相矛盾，莫衷一是。逼报的数字，大多靠不住，不仅对工作没有帮助，往往反而有害。
    现在，中央人民政府政务院发布了“关于清理现行调查统计表格及禁止乱发调查统计表格的指示”。调查统计工作中的这种混乱状况绝不容忍再继续下去了。希望各级政府及各业务部门认真执行这个指示，坚决消灭调查统计工作中的混乱状态。
