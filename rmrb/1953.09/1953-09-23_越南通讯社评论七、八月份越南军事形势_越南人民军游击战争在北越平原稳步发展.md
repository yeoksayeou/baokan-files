Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The Vietnam News Agency published a commentary on the military situation in Vietnam in July and August.

The commentary said: In recent months, guerrilla warfare has developed steadily in the northern Vietnamese plains. In addition to removing many enemy strongholds, the People's Army troops have launched attacks on enemy-occupied cities, including Haiphong and many provincial capitals such as Jian'an and Nam Dinh, and have continuously intercepted trains, highways, and river transport teams on the enemy's main transportation lines. The development of guerrilla warfare has made the enemy's strongholds in the northern Vietnamese plains feel the great pressure from the People's Army and has put the enemy in danger of being attacked from both inside and outside.

The commentary pointed out: This is why the French aggressors regard expanding the puppet army, withdrawing many strongholds, and concentrating mobile forces to deal with the constantly strengthening guerrilla warfare as matters of absolute importance.

The commentary said: Promoting the plan to pacify the Northern Vietnamese plains has now become the main activity of the French colonialists in the military field. The French colonialists concentrated their forces to carry out mopping-up operations in their rear. However, they were fiercely resisted by the Vietnamese People's Army and guerrillas everywhere, and suffered heavy losses.

The commentary pointed out the weaknesses of the mopping-up operations launched by the French army in Hung Yen, Ha Dong and other places: Because the enemy concentrated a large number of troops in a small area for a long period of mopping-up operations, guerrilla warfare in other places was able to take advantage of the opportunity to develop. At the same time, most of the enemy troops participating in the mopping-up operations were puppet troops with very low morale, so they were easily disintegrated by the tenacious resistance of the People's Army. The commentary explained: Taking advantage of the fact that the enemy concentrated a large number of troops in the mopping-up area, the People's Army strengthened its activities in the Red River Delta and central North Vietnam, removing many important strongholds in Thai Binh, Hai Duong, Vinh Phuc and other provinces, and annihilated a large number of enemy troops.

The commentary finally pointed out: The military situation in Vietnam in the past two months is that the French army is stepping up the implementation of the Navarre Plan, but it has been attacked by the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people are raising their vigilance to defeat France's new military plan.

    越南通讯社评论七、八月份越南军事形势
    越南人民军游击战争在北越平原稳步发展
    【新华社二十一日讯】越南通讯社发表了关于七、八月份越南军事形势的评论。
    评论说：近几个月来，游击战争在北越平原稳步发展。人民军部队除了拔除许多敌军据点以外，曾经向敌占城市发动了进攻，其中包括海防市和建安、南定等许多省会，并不断截击敌军主要交通线上的火车、公路和内河运输队。游击战争的发展已使敌军在北越平原地区的据点感受到人民军的重大压力，并使敌人面临着遭受内外夹攻的危险。
    评论指出：这些就是为什么法国侵略者把扩充伪军、撤退许多据点和集中机动部队来应付不断加强的游击战等，当作具有绝对重要性的事情的原因。
    评论说：推行平定北越平原的计划现已成为法国殖民者在军事方面的主要活动。法国殖民者集中兵力在他们的后方进行扫荡。但他们到处遭到越南人民军和游击队的猛烈抗击，损失惨重。
    评论指出法军在兴安、河东各地发动的扫荡的弱点说：由于敌军在一个小地区里面集中大量部队进行长期的扫荡，因而其他各地游击战争能够乘机发展起来。同时，参加扫荡的敌军大部分是伪军，士气非常低，因而很容易被人民军的顽强抗击所瓦解。评论说明：人民军乘着敌人在扫荡地区集中了大量部队，在红河三角洲和北越中部地区加强活动，拔除太平、海阳、永福等省的许多重要据点，歼灭了大量敌军。
    评论最后指出：过去两个月的越南军事形势是：法军在加紧推行纳瓦尔计划，但遭到越南人民的打击。越南人民正在提高警惕，以挫败法国的新军事计划。
