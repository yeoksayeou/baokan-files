The Shanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture convened a provincial wheat production technology conference from July 27th to August 3rd. The conference summarized the experiences of various regions in implementing dense planting of wheat and fighting against frost and insect pests to increase production, and formulated a technical guidance plan for wheat sowing throughout the province this autumn.

The conference called for further promotion of wheat yield increase techniques this year, so that the average wheat yield per mu in the province will reach 110 jin next year. At the same time, the wheat planting area will be expanded by about 5% to increase the total wheat yield of the province from another aspect.

According to the technical situation of wheat planting in various regions this year, the conference particularly emphasized advocating the advanced dense planting method of narrow rows, uniform sowing, and appropriately increasing the amount of sowing on large areas of land. The conference also stipulated the density and sowing amount of wheat. The row spacing should generally be shortened to 4 to 6寸 (inches); the sowing width should be widened to 2 to 3寸 (inches); for paddy fields with an original sowing amount of less than 20 jin, increase it by one-fifth or one-third, but not more than 25 jin, and for returning stubble fields, not more than 27 jin; for dry land with an original sowing amount of less than 10 jin, increase it by one-third or one-half, but not more than 15 jin.

The following points were also determined for other cultivation techniques: (1) When wheat is affected by frost damage, farmers should be mobilized to hoe more, topdress more fertilizer, and irrigate more to rescue it in time; before frost, management should be strengthened, the land should be carefully cultivated, and sowing should be done in a timely manner to increase the cold resistance of wheat. (2) Strengthen technical instruction, put all the newly promoted plows into use, and in areas with the largest number of old plows, organize the masses to plow finely and deeply. Areas with suitable conditions should promote the use of tandem plows to achieve the purpose of deep plowing. (3) In order to overcome the phenomenon of "missing seedlings and broken ridges," it is necessary to pay attention to techniques in terms of seeds, fertilizers, sowing techniques, and pest and disease control. In particular, production techniques should be rewarded in terms of mutual assistance and equivalent price policies.

Finally, the conference believed that the guarantee for increasing production by improving technology lies in strengthening specific leadership and promoting the above-mentioned experiences and scientific technologies for high yields. To this end, first of all, attention should be paid to educating farmers so that they recognize and value the significance of increasing wheat yields. Secondly, technical instruction should be organized in a planned manner. Technical training should be conducted for cadres leading wheat production, so that they can go to the countryside to publicize and implement the technology. Local cadres should also help agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and skilled wheat growers to adopt new technologies and conduct experiments to ensure that they strive for increased wheat production next year.

    山西省农业厅总结今年小麦增产技术经验
    山西省人民政府农业厅在七月二十七日至八月三日召开了全省小麦生产技术会议，总结了今年各地实行小麦密植和与冻、虫灾害作斗争的增产经验，并制订出全省今秋小麦播种技术指导方案。
    会议要求今年进一步推广小麦增产技术，使全省明年小麦产量平均达到每亩一百一十斤，同时扩大小麦播种面积百分之五左右，以从另一方面来提高全省小麦总产量。
    会议根据今年各地种植小麦的技术情况，特别强调提倡在大面积土地上实行窄行、匀种，适当增加播种量的先进密植法。会议并规定了小麦密度及播种量。行距一般要缩短到四寸至六寸；播幅加宽到二寸至三寸；水地原播种量二十斤以下者，再增加五分之一或三分之一，最多不超过二十五斤，回茬地不超过二十七斤；旱地原播种量十斤以下者，再增加三分之一或二分之一，最高不超过十五斤。
    在其他耕作技术上还确定了以下几点：（一）在遇到小麦发生冻害时，要发动农民多锄、多追肥、多灌溉，及时抢救；冻前要加强管理，精耕细作，适时播种，以增加小麦抗寒力。（二）加强技术传授，把已推广的新犁全部使用起来，在数量最大的旧犁地区，组织群众细犁深耕，有条件的地区推广套犁法，以达到深耕目的。（三）为克服“缺苗断垅”现象，必须从种籽、肥料、播种技术、防治病虫害等方面讲究技术，特别在互助等价政策上奖励生产技术。
    最后，会议认为提高技术达到增产的保证在于加强具体的领导，推广上述丰产经验与科学技术。为此，首先要注意教育农民使他们认识和重视提高小麦产量的意义。其次要有计划地组织技术传授。对领导小麦生产的干部要进行一次技术训练，以便使他们分头深入农村宣传贯彻技术。各地干部对农业生产合作社、互助组以及种麦能手还要帮助他们采用新的技术和进行试验，以保证争取明年小麦增产。
