Under the urging and assistance of employees, the Tax Bureau, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Shanghai's industrial and commercial businesses have generally launched a self-inspection and supplementary tax reporting campaign. In order to rectify tax payment discipline, the Shanghai Municipal Tax Bureau is handling tax cases according to their respective circumstances; the People's Courts of various districts have also successively convened sentencing rallies to handle a number of tax cases transferred by the Tax Bureau to the courts, according to government policies and the severity of the circumstances.

Since the Third Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee suggested that the Shanghai Municipal People's Government rectify the tax payment discipline of the industrial and commercial sector and called on industrial and commercial businesses throughout the city to carry out self-inspection and supplementary reporting, the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the federations of industry and commerce in various districts have successively mobilized, communicated, and urged industrial and commercial businesses to conduct self-inspection and supplementary reporting. The broad masses of workers and shop assistants in Shanghai responded to the call of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, actively persuading and assisting capitalists in conducting inspections, and exposing some capitalists who were not serious in their self-inspection and attempted to conceal the facts of tax evasion and underpayment. The Tax Bureau of various districts simultaneously launched guidance and accounting work. The tax evasion and underpayment problems discovered so far further prove that the situation of tax evasion and underpayment in Shanghai's industrial and commercial sector is quite common and serious. For example, the Songshan District Tax Bureau inspected 47 industrial and commercial businesses and found that all of them had tax evasion and underpayment problems, with the amount of tax evasion and underpayment accounting for 31.9% of the declared amount. The Changshu District Tax Bureau inspected 42 self-calculating households and found that 40 households had tax evasion and underpayment; it inspected 69 households subject to democratic appraisal and found that 67 households also had tax evasion and underpayment. In the self-inspection and supplementary reporting work, some industrial and commercial businesses are more serious and responsible. For example, Yang Zhangquan of Qian Da Firm in the Yimiao District can take the initiative to invite employees to assist, quickly organize manpower, and discover problems by combining accounting records with facts and classifying them. Some industrial and commercial businesses, such as Ying Hongchang of Saichang Factory in the Luwan District, in addition to actively conducting inspections themselves, also helped promote inspections in the same industry. However, there are still many industrial and commercial businesses that are still waiting and watching, perfunctorily dealing with the matter, and trying to muddle through.

The Tax Bureau of various districts in Shanghai generally handle industrial and commercial businesses with tax evasion and underpayment problems discovered in the self-inspection and supplementary reporting process according to the severity of their evasion and their attitude. Industrial and commercial businesses that conduct serious self-inspection and earnestly conduct supplementary reporting are generally given lenient treatment. For example, at a conference convened by the Jiangning District Tax Bureau at the District Federation of Industry and Commerce on September 4th, it was announced that Yagong Iron Factory and others, because they were able to actively conduct self-inspection and supplementary reporting and recognize their mistakes, were given lenient treatment, with no fines or late payment fees, and were only ordered to pay supplementary taxes. Two households that did not have an honest attitude towards self-inspection and supplementary reporting were publicly warned by tax officials at the meeting and ordered to conduct thorough inspections within three days, otherwise they would be strictly dealt with. Huachang Electric Motor Factory had tax evasion problems and did not seriously conduct self-inspection and supplementary reporting, and in addition to being ordered to pay supplementary taxes, a fine of one time the amount was added. As for some industrial and commercial businesses whose tax evasion situation is particularly serious, and whose attitude is bad, or even deliberately undermining tax payment discipline and resisting the Tax Bureau's inspection, they are transferred by the Tax Bureau to the court for severe punishment. For example, the Tax Bureau transferred two cases to the Penglai District People's Court for handling. One case was: Shao Zhihong, the capitalist of Tongguang Sand Casting Factory, has consistently failed to comply with tax payment discipline. During the 1952 income tax final settlement period, he deliberately avoided meeting and resisted declaration, and evaded business tax by "flying across the sea" and conducted "guerrilla transactions", sheltering travelling merchants from tax evasion and obtaining illegal profits from it, successively evading more than 1 billion yuan in business tax; the other case was: Wang Guozhong, the capitalist of Xinmin Electric Welding Shop, deliberately undermined the national tax revenue system, owing more than 30 million yuan in income tax and business tax. After repeated urging by the Tax Bureau, he resolutely refused to pay, and maliciously scolded and insulted tax officials, causing a very bad influence in the industry. These two cases were investigated and verified by the Penglai District People's Court. The court, because Shao Zhihong and Wang Guozhong dared to deliberately evade national taxes and undermine tax payment discipline after the "Five-Anti" campaign, and the circumstances were egregious, in order to uphold the law, convened a sentencing rally on September 4th and sentenced Shao Zhihong and Wang Guozhong to imprisonment, sent them to labor reform during the execution period, and recovered all taxes payable and statutory late payment fees.

The tax case handling meetings of the Tax Bureau of various districts in Shanghai and the sentencing rallies of the People's Court of various districts have greatly educated many industrial and commercial businesses. Through these meetings, they realized that only by conducting self-inspection and supplementary reporting honestly can they receive lenient treatment. Some industrial and commercial businesses that did not seriously conduct self-inspection and supplementary reporting before are now also starting to actively confess their problems.

    上海市工商户展开偷漏税自查补报工作
    认真自查补报户受到税务局宽大处理
    个别严重违法户被法院判处有期徒刑
    上海市工商业户的自查补报工作，在职工、税务局及工商业联合会的督促协助之下普遍展开。为了整饬纳税纪律，上海市各区税务分局正分别情况，对税务案件进行处理；各区人民法院也先后召开宣判大会，根据政府政策，分别情节轻重，处理了一批由税务局移送到法院的税务案件。
    自上海市各界人民代表会议协商委员会常务委员会第三次扩大会议建议上海市人民政府整饬工商界纳税纪律，号召全市工商业户开展自查补报工作以后，上海市工商业联合会和各区工商业联合会先后对工商业户进行了动员、传达，督促工商业户自查补报。上海市广大工人、店员响应上海市总工会的号召，积极劝导和协助资方进行检查，对一些不认真自行检查企图隐瞒偷税漏税事实的资方进行了揭发。各区税务分局同时展开辅导、查帐工作。目前发现的偷税漏税问题，进一步证明上海市工商界偷漏税收的情况相当普遍而严重。如嵩山区税务分局检查了四十七家工商业户，全部都有偷税漏税问题，偷漏税所得额占申报额百分之三十一点九。常熟区税务分局检查了四十二户自行计算户，发现有四十户偷税漏税；检查了六十九户民主评议户，也发现有六十七户偷税漏税。在自查补报工作中，有的工商业户比较认真负责。如邑庙区乾大行杨璋全能主动邀请职工协助，迅速组织人力，以帐面结合事实，分门别类发掘问题。有的工商业户，如卢湾区赛昌厂应洪昌等除自己主动进行检查外，还帮助推动同业进行检查。但是目前还有不少工商业户，还在存心等待观望，敷衍塞责，企图蒙混过关。
    上海市各区税务分局对于自查补报中发现有偷税漏税问题的工商业户，一般都按其偷漏情节的轻重及其表现态度加以处理。对于认真自查、切实进行补报的工商业户，一般都予以宽大处理。如江宁区税务分局九月四日在该区工商业联合会召开的大会上，即宣布亚工铁工厂等因为能积极自查补报、认识自己的错误，决定予以宽大处理，不罚、不加滞纳金，仅令其补税。有两户对自查补报态度不老实，税务局干部即在会上公开提出警告，限令在三天内切实进行检查，否则将予以严格处理。华昌电机厂有偷税问题，且不认真自查补报，除令其补税外，加处罚金一倍。至于某些偷漏情况特别严重，而又态度恶劣，甚至故意破坏纳税纪律，抗拒税务局检查的工商业户，则由税务局移送法院予以严惩。如税务局移送蓬莱区人民法院处理了两个案件。一个案件是：通光翻砂厂资方邵志鸿一贯不遵守纳税纪律，在一九五二年所得税汇算清交期间，故意避不见面，抗拒申报，又以“飞过海”方式偷漏营业税，并进行“游击交易”，包庇行商偷税，从中获取非法利润，先后偷漏营业额达十亿余元；另一个案件是：新民电焊行资方王国忠蓄意破坏国家税收制度，拖欠所得税及营业税三千余万元，经税务局一再催促，仍坚决抗交，而且恶意谩骂、侮辱税务工作人员，在同业中引起极不好的影响。这两个案件经蓬莱区人民法院调查属实。该法院因邵志鸿、王国忠在“五反”后仍敢蓄意偷漏国税，破坏纳税纪律，情节恶劣，为了严肃法纪，于九月四日召开宣判大会，判处邵志鸿、王国忠有期徒刑，在执行期间遣送劳役改造，并追缴全部应交税款及法定滞纳金。
    上海市各区税务分局的税务案件处理会议和各区人民法院的宣判大会，使许多工商业户受到很大教育。通过这些会议，他们认识到只有老老实实地进行自查补报，才能得到宽大处理。有些原来没有认真自查补报的工商业户，现在也开始主动交代问题。
