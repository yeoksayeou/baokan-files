    Yuanhua Coal Mine Long-Term Neglect of Safety in Production
    Frequent Accidents Cause Serious Losses

    Reader Du Jin writes: On May 29th, a fire at the No. 1 West Direct Shaft of the Tongzibao Mine of the jointly state-private Yuanhua Coal Mine in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, caused a serious loss of fifteen worker deaths, six minor injuries, and several days of production stoppage due to workers such as Huang Shiwu smoking underground, resulting in 1,600 tons less coal produced. The Yuanhua Coal Mine frequently experiences accidents. From January to mid-May of this year, there were 337 accidents of varying severity, resulting in six worker deaths and 238 minor injuries. Frequent accidents not only threaten the lives, safety, and health of workers, but also seriously affect production. According to the first quarter inspection this year, the mine produced approximately 5,800 tons less coal due to work-related injuries and sick leave. In the first half of this year, except for March and April, the mine did not complete its production plan in other months, and in June it only completed 73.86 percent of the plan.

    The main reasons for the frequent serious accidents at the Yuanhua Coal Mine are:

    First, the idea of combining production with safety has not been implemented among the broad masses of workers. From January of last year to May of this year, the mine conducted two safety inspections in conjunction with production reforms and discussions and revisions of production plans. Some problems were discovered and resolved during the inspections, but because the masses were not earnestly mobilized, many key issues were not resolved. After each accident, the leadership did not educate everyone through typical examples, but formed a simple tendency towards punitive measures. Therefore, the thinking of many workers who neglected safety in production has not been corrected for a long time, and some cadres even have the mistaken idea that "safety is incompatible with production, and production is incompatible with safety."

    Second, workers lack systematic technical operating procedure education, so violations of technical operating procedures are very common. An analysis of the 996 accidents in 1952 showed that accidents caused by violations of operating procedures accounted for 97.2 percent, and roof falls and rib spalling accounted for about 80 percent of general accidents.

    Third, there is a lack of various responsibility systems to ensure safety in production. For example, cadres in safety organizations lack a clear division of labor and do not cooperate well with each other, creating a phenomenon where everyone has the right to intervene, but no one is responsible for anything, leaving those below at a loss. The company has a technical inspection section, but the organization is unsound and the strength is weak. The labor organization in some units has not been reasonably adjusted. For example, Well No. 26 assigned technically skilled workers to the first group, but the second group did not have a single technically skilled person, so this group had two dead blasting accidents in a row. Regarding the safety responsibility system, although the leadership drafted regulations on the scope of responsibilities of each unit a long time ago, they did not mobilize everyone to discuss and implement them, resulting in a long-term chaotic situation where no one was responsible. For example, before the accident on May 29, technicians Feng Jiajun and others knew that workers in the first-level group had previously caused a fire by smoking underground, but they neither raised any objections nor reported it to their superiors. The masses reflect: "The higher-ups are high above, the middle-level officials push and shove responsibility, and the lower-level officials are carefree." In addition, the past inspection system at the mine entrance was later abolished. The leadership once called for the establishment of a shift handover system, but it was not implemented due to the lack of specific content. The safety reward and punishment system that was implemented in the past was also aborted due to imperfections in the system itself.

    I believe that the leading cadres of the Yuanhua Coal Mine should learn from the painful lessons of past accidents and conduct practical inspections and improvements in their work in response to the above problems.

### 源华煤矿长期忽视安全生产  经常发生事故造成严重损失

    源华煤矿长期忽视安全生产
    经常发生事故造成严重损失
    读者杜劲来信：湖北黄石市公私合营源华煤矿桐梓堡矿厂第一层西直井，五月二十九日因修井工人黄世五等在井下吸烟而引起火灾，造成死亡职工十五人，轻伤六人，停产数日，少产煤一千六百吨的严重损失。源华煤矿是经常发生事故的，从今年一月到五月中就发生大小事故三百三十七次，死亡工人六人，轻伤二百三十八人。频繁的事故不仅威胁着工人的生命安全与身体健康，而且也严重地影响了生产。据今年第一季度检查，该矿因工伤病假而少产煤约五千八百多吨；该矿今年上半年除三、四月份外，其它月份都没有完成生产计划，六月份甚至只完成计划的百分之七十三点八六。
    源华煤矿经常发生严重事故的主要原因是：
    第一、没有把生产必须和安全相结合的思想贯彻到广大职工群众中去。该矿从去年一月到今年五月曾结合生产改革和讨论修订生产计划，进行过两次安全检查。在检查中也发现和解决了一些问题；但由于没有认真发动群众，很多关键性的问题都没有得到解决。在历次发生事故后，领导方面都没有通过典型事例教育大家，而形成了简单的惩办主义倾向。因此，很多职工忽视安全生产的思想长期没有得到纠正，某些干部甚至有着“要安全就不能生产，要生产就不能安全”的错误思想。
    第二、对职工缺乏系统的技术操作规程教育，因而工人违犯技术操作规程的情况很普遍。从一九五二年九百九十六次事故中分析，因违犯操作规程造成的事故占百分之九十七点二，在一般事故中冒顶、片帮事故要占百分之八十左右。
    第三、缺乏保证安全生产的各种责任制度。如安全组织中的干部缺乏明确的分工，没有很好地互相配合，形成人人有权过问，事事无人负责，下面无所适从的现象。公司有技术检查科，但组织不健全，力量薄弱。有些单位中劳动组织没有合理调整。如二十六号井将技术熟练的工人编为第一小组，可是第二小组就没有一个技术熟练的人，因而这个组曾连续发生过两次死炮爆炸事故。在安全责任制方面，领导方面虽然很早就拟订了各单位职责范围条例，但没有发动大家讨论和贯彻执行，形成了长期无人负责的混乱现象。如五月二十九日的事故发生以前，技术员冯家君等知道一层组工人曾因在井下吸烟失过火，可是既没提出意见，也没向上报告。群众反映：“上级是高高在上，中级是你推我让，下级是吊儿浪当”。此外，过去的井口检查制，后来也取消了。领导方面曾号召建立交接班制度，但因无具体内容而没有执行；过去实行过的安全奖惩制度也因制度本身不完善而流产了。
    我认为源华煤矿的领导干部应吸取历次事故的惨痛教训，针对上述问题，切实检查和改进工作。
