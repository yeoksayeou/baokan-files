Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 26th dispatch from the German News Agency: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, delivered a report at the 16th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany on the achievements in implementing the new policy and the issue of its thorough implementation, entitled "The Road to Peace, Unity, and Prosperity." This report has been accepted as the basis for the future work of the Socialist Unity Party.

Ulbricht first pointed out that the national income of the German Democratic Republic is increasing year by year, and the level of national income in 1953 will be 15% higher than in 1952.

The total industrial output from January to August this year increased by 11.3% compared to the same period last year. The average production value in the past few months reached 134.4% of that in 1936.

Ulbricht pointed out that the agreements of the Soviet-German talks provided great possibilities for the further development of industrial production. In the second half of this year, the total output value of state-owned industries will increase from 14.5 billion marks to 16.5 billion marks; the production of private industries will increase by 18%, and handicrafts will increase by 21%. The portion of national income allocated to people's consumption will increase by 16% compared to the level of 1952. The pace of economic progress in the German Democratic Republic is far higher than in any capitalist country, and this rate of development will be guaranteed throughout the entire Five-Year Plan period.

When mentioning the continuous increase in the people's purchasing power, he pointed out that if the number of goods sold in 1950 is 100, it increased to 124 in 1951 and 145 in 1952. According to the new policy, it will increase to 177 in 1954 and 185 in 1955. The people's purchasing power in 1955 will be greatly higher than the figures originally stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. Ulbricht then talked about the need to fully exploit the production potential in various industrial sectors. He said: In order to improve the living standards of the working people, we must produce more. This means increasing labor productivity, improving work organization, and using the most advanced technology. The most important thing is to do everything possible to reduce costs.

Ulbricht pointed out the important assistance the Soviet Union provided to the German Democratic Republic in improving the situation in the German Democratic Republic. He said: The most important task in improving the living standards of the working people is to systematically continue to implement the policy of reducing prices and greatly expand the supply of goods to residents. The primary condition for achieving this is to increase production. He said: In 1954, the existing rationing system will be abolished, and prices will be reduced again by 4 billion to 5 billion marks.

Ulbricht spoke of the important achievements made in agriculture. He pointed out that since 1946, the yield per unit area of ​​corn, potatoes, and sugar beets has been continuously increasing. The number of livestock has also increased significantly. According to the new policy, the decision to reduce the amount of agricultural products that farmers must sell to the state allows individual farmers and cooperative farmers to freely sell more agricultural products. In 1953, farmers will directly benefit by about 1 billion marks as a result.

Ulbricht said: At present, there are a total of 4,800 agricultural production cooperatives in the German Democratic Republic, occupying 739,000 hectares of land, including 61,000 farming households, with 137,600 members. 13% of all cultivated land in the German Democratic Republic is owned by cooperatives. All the work of the cooperatives has proven them to be a huge force. Their organization of spring plowing, sowing, harvesting, etc. are all first-rate. He pointed out that the principle of completely voluntary membership must be strictly observed.

Ulbricht emphasized that the government and the party will continue to further consolidate the alliance of workers and working peasants. This alliance is fighting to defend peace, strive for the conclusion of a German peace treaty, and oppose re-militarization and the enslavement policies of the American arms magnates and the Adenauer government of West Germany.

Ulbricht finally mentioned the preparations for the Fourth Party Congress. He announced: As a political party of the working class, the Socialist Unity Party believes that its most important task is to strengthen the German Democratic Republic as a bastion of peace and a model of democratic economic and cultural life, and to consolidate the power of the workers and peasants. He said: The new policy proposed by the Socialist Unity Party provides a prospect for a prosperous and happy future for all the German people.

In his report, Ulbricht referred to the situation in West Germany, pointing out that the improvement of the living standards of the people of the German Democratic Republic is of all-German importance. He said: "If the people of West Germany recognize the power of the workers and peasants and the superiority of the planned economy in the German Democratic Republic, as well as the achievements made by the workers, the concerted action of the working class and the cooperation between the workers of West Germany and the German Democratic Republic can be achieved more quickly. That is why achieving economic progress by thoroughly implementing the new policy is of such great importance for winning over the people of West Germany."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 27th dispatch from the German News Agency on September 24th: The Anti-Fascist Democratic League of the German Democratic Republic, composed of various Democratic Parties (including: the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Christian Democratic Union, the Free Democratic Party, the Democratic Farmers' Party, the National Democratic Party, the Free German Trade Union Federation, the Free German Youth League, the Democratic Women's Federation) held a meeting on September 21st to discuss how to implement the new policy as soon as possible.

After discussions, all parties unanimously agreed to the covenant set by the Anti-Fascist Democratic League of the German Democratic Republic. In this covenant, all parties and organizations guaranteed to mobilize their party (association, league) members to strive for the successful and effective implementation of the new policy, and to wage a persistent struggle against all enemies who attempt to undermine the complete implementation of the new policy.

The covenant pointed out: "The Democratic League has the task of consolidating the German Democratic Republic and defending it from attacks by enemies from within and without."

When mentioning that the German people must live in peace with the people of the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries, the Democratic League emphasized its friendly policy with the above-mentioned countries and its struggle against any instigation that is hostile to these countries.

    在德国统一社会党中央第十六次全体会议上
    乌布利希报告贯彻新方针所取得的成就
    德国民主联盟举行会议讨论贯彻执行新方针问题
    【新华社二十六日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记瓦尔特·乌布利希在德国统一社会党中央委员会第十六次全体会议上，就执行新方针中所取得的成就和贯彻执行新方针的问题作了题为“走向和平、统一与繁荣的道路”的报告，这篇报告已被接受作为统一社会党今后工作的基础。
    乌布利希首先指出，德意志民主共和国的国民收入一年比一年增加，一九五三年国民收入的水平将比一九五二年高百分之十五。
    今年一月到八月的工业总产量比去年同期提高了百分之十一点三。过去几个月中平均生产值达到一九三六年的百分之一百三十四点四。
    乌布利希指出，苏德会谈的协议提供了工业生产进一步发展的巨大可能。今年下半年，国营工业的生产总值将从一百四十五亿马克提高到一百六十五亿马克；私营工业的生产将增加百分之十八，手工业将增加百分之二十一。国民收入中人民消费所占部分将比一九五二年的水平提高百分之十六。德意志民主共和国的经济进步的速度远比任何资本主义国家的为高，在整个五年计划期间，均将保证这种发展的速度。
    在提到人民的购买力不断提高时，他指出，如以一九五○年出售货物的数字为一百，一九五一年即增加到一百二十四，一九五二年增加到一百四十五。根据新方针，一九五四年将增加到一百七十七，一九五五年将增加到一百八十五。一九五五年人民的购买力将比五年计划中原来所规定的数字大大提高。乌布利希接着谈到，必须充分发挥各工业部门中的生产潜力。他说：为了改善劳动人民生活，必须生产更多的东西。这就是说提高劳动生产率，改进工作组织，使用最先进的技术。最重要的是尽一切可能降低成本。
    乌布利希指出苏联给予德意志民主共和国的经济援助在改善德意志民主共和国情况方面的重要帮助。他说：改善劳动人民生活的最重要的工作是有步骤地继续执行减低物价的政策和大大地扩大对居民的物品供应，做到这一点的首要条件是增加生产。他说：一九五四年将取消现存的配给制，同时将再度减低物价四十亿至五十亿马克。
    乌布利希谈到在农业中所取得的重要成就。他指出，自一九四六年以来，玉蜀黍、马铃薯和甜菜的单位面积产量不断提高。牲畜数量也大大地增加了。根据新方针减低农民缴售额的决定，使个体农民与合作农民可以自由出卖更多的生产品。一九五三年农民因此将直接得益约十亿马克。
    乌布利希说：目前在德意志民主共和国共有四千八百个农业生产合作社，占有土地七十三万九千公顷，包括六万一千个农户，拥有十三万七千六百个社员，德意志民主共和国全部耕地的百分之十三为合作社所有。合作社的全部工作已证明它们是一个巨大的力量。他们组织的春耕播种、收割工作等都是头等的。他指出，必须严格遵守入社完全自愿的原则。
    乌布利希强调政府和党将继续进一步巩固工人与劳动农民的联盟。这个联盟为了保卫和平，争取缔结对德和约，反对重新军国主义化和美国军火大王与西德阿登纳政府的奴役政策而进行斗争。
    乌布利希最后提到第四次党代表大会的筹备工作。他宣布：作为一个工人阶级的政党，统一社会党认为，它的最主要的任务是加强作为和平的堡垒和民主的经济与文化生活高涨的典范的德意志民主共和国与巩固工人与农民的权力。他说：统一社会党所建议实行的新方针为全体德国人民提供了一个走向繁荣与幸福的未来的前途。
    乌布利希在报告中曾联系到西德的情况，指出德意志民主共和国人民生活水平的提高具有全德的重要性。他说：“如果西德人民认识到了德意志民主共和国国内工人与农民的权力和计划经济的优越性，以及工人所取得的成就，工人阶级的一致行动与西德和德意志民主共和国工人之间的合作就可以更快地达到。这就是为什么贯彻执行新方针而取得经济上的进步，对于争取团结西德人民具有这样巨大的重要性的原因。”
    【新华社二十七日讯】德意志通讯社柏林二十四日讯：由德意志民主共和国各民主党派（包括：德国统一社会党、基督教民主联盟、自由民主党、民主农民党、国家民主党、自由德国工会联合会、自由德国青年联盟、民主妇女联合会）组成的德意志民主共和国反法西斯民主联盟于九月二十一日召开了会议，讨论如何尽快地贯彻执行新方针的问题。
    各党派在讨论之后一致同意德意志民主共和国反法西斯民主联盟所定出的公约。各党派及团体在这个公约上保证动员他们的党（会、盟）员为成功地和有效地执行新方针、为与所有企图破坏完满执行新方针的敌人展开坚持的斗争而努力。
    公约指出：“民主联盟负有巩固德意志民主共和国和保卫它不受来自内部与外部敌人的打击的任务。”
    在提到德国人民必须与苏联及各人民民主国家的人民和平相处时，民主联盟强调了它与上述国家的友好政策并进行反对任何敌视这些国家的挑拨煽动的斗争。
