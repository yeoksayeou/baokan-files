    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 31st, TASS dispatch: The German Communist Party, disregarding all obstacles from the Bonn group, has been launching an election campaign across West Germany in recent days. "Fight for peace, bread, and freedom! Fight for the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany! Oppose Adenauer's policy of concluding military treaties! Oppose militarization and West Germany's joining aggressive blocs!" These are the main slogans of the German Communist Party's election campaign.
    German Communist Party Chairman Max Reimann delivered a speech at an election rally of thousands of people in Stuttgart. In his speech, Reimann talked about the Soviet government's note of August 15th regarding the German question and the results of the Soviet-German negotiations in Moscow. Reimann said that all Germans in the East and West believe that the Soviet note is the salvation of the German people. This note is in the interests of the German people and also in the interests of the people of European countries. Reimann sharply criticized Adenauer's anti-national policies. He said that if the Adenauer government were to remain in power for another four years, it would mean the implementation of the Bonn and Paris military treaties. However, we Communists hope to implement a different policy after the September 6th elections in Bonn.
    The German Communist Party also held an election rally in Oberhausen Sterkrade. Emil Sandel, the German Communist Party's candidate for the Federal Parliament, said at the rally that the lives of metalworkers and miners in the Ruhr area can only be improved if the Adenauer government is dealt a fatal blow in the September 6th elections.
    Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, August 29th, TASS dispatch: The Austrian "Abend-Echo" published the following Bonn news:
    Due to a slip of the tongue by a prominent political leader of the Bonn Christian Democratic Union, politicians in Bonn and the West German public have learned the details of the sources of Adenauer's election funds. Of Adenauer's total campaign funds of more than 75 million marks, 6 million marks were given to him by the US High Commissioner to West Germany, Conant; the Federation of West German Industrialists, who used to support Hitler, gave him 50 million marks, the Catholic Church gave 1.5 million marks, and the banking sector gave 18 million marks. This huge sum shows that Washington and West German industrialists linked to Wall Street are very concerned about the growing resistance to Adenauer's policies and have therefore decided to spare no expense to win him a victory in the elections.

    德共举行竞选集会号召人民击败阿登纳政府
    美国及西德垄断资本家供给阿登纳集团巨额竞选经费
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社柏林八月三十一日讯：德国共产党不顾波恩集团的种种阻碍，最近几天来正在西德各地展开竞选运动。“为和平、面包和自由而斗争！为建立一个统一的、民主的和爱好和平的德国而斗争！反对阿登纳的缔结军事条约的政策！反对军国主义化和西德加入侵略集团的政策！”这就是德国共产党竞选运动的主要口号。
    德国共产党主席马克斯·雷曼在斯图加特的几千人的竞选集会上发表演说。雷曼在演说中谈到苏联政府八月十五日关于德国问题的照会和苏德在莫斯科谈判的结果。雷曼说，东西部全体德国人认为，苏联的照会是拯救德国人民的。这个照会既符合德国人民的利益，也符合欧洲各国人民的利益。雷曼对阿登纳的反民族政策给予了尖锐的批评。他说，要是阿登纳政府能再执政四年，那就是意味着实现波恩与巴黎军事条约。但是，我们共产党人希望在波恩九月六日选举以后执行另一种政策。
    德国共产党召开的竞选集会也在欧伯豪森斯特尔克拉德举行了。德国共产党的联邦议院候选人艾米尔·桑德尔在集会上发言说，只有在九月六日的选举中给阿登纳政府以致命的打击，鲁尔的五金工人和矿工的生活才有可能改善。
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社维也纳八月二十九日讯：奥地利“晚报”登载了下面一条波恩消息：
    由于波恩基督教民主党某一位显要政治领袖言谈大意，波恩政界人士和西德公众得知了阿登纳竞选经费来源的详细情况。在阿登纳全部七千五百多万马克的竞选经费中，六百万马克是美国驻西德高级专员康南特给他的；以前向来掏腰包支持希特勒的西德工业家联合会给了他五千万马克，天主教教会给了一百五十万马克，银行界给了一千八百万马克。这样一笔巨额款项说明，华盛顿和与华尔街有关系的西德工业界人士很为阿登纳的政策日益遭到强烈的抵抗而担忧，因而决定不惜任何代价，要为他在选举中争得胜利。
