The Great Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance
——Editorial from the Soviet "Pravda" on September 18th

Today, "Pravda" published the news of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, G.M. Malenkov, receiving the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Union, Zhang Wentian. During the meeting, the ambassador presented G.M. Malenkov with a telegram from the Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong, thanking the Soviet Union for its assistance in the economic construction of the People's Republic of China.

While accepting the telegram, Comrade G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, said that the Soviet people are rejoiced by the achievements of the great Chinese people in improving the economy and culture of their country. The further development of the Chinese economy and the cause of industrialization have a solid foundation and are in safe hands. Comrade G.M. Malenkov said that the Soviet government sincerely wishes the People's Republic of China prosperity and strength, and sincerely wishes the great Sino-Soviet friendship alliance to be further strengthened for the sake of our two peoples, and for the consolidation of peace and international security.

The telegram of Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, published in today's "Pravda," is an important document proving the further strengthening of the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The telegram reads: "The Central People's Government Committee of the People's Republic of China, at its meeting on September 15, 1953, listened with satisfaction to the report by Comrade Li Fuchun, representative of the government delegation of the People's Republic of China, on the issue of consultations with the Soviet government regarding the Soviet government's assistance to our country's economic construction. The Central People's Government Committee unanimously believes that, thanks to the great Soviet government's agreement to provide systematic economic and technical assistance in the construction and reconstruction of 91 new enterprises in China, as well as 50 enterprises currently under construction and reconstruction, the Chinese people will be able to gradually establish their own powerful heavy industry by learning from the advanced experience and the latest technological achievements of the Soviet Union. This is of extremely great significance for China's industrialization, for China's gradual transition to socialism, and for strengthening the power of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union."

Comrade Mao Zedong, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their great, comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance. He said that the Chinese government and the Chinese people are willing to strengthen the economic cooperation and friendly alliance between the Soviet Union and China with their unremitting efforts, in order to jointly strive for the cause of world peace.

The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries have formed a strong democratic and socialist camp, and its strength is constantly growing and expanding. One of the decisive advantages of the socialist camp, and the fundamental difference between it and the imperialist camp, lies in the fact that it has no internal contradictions and struggles, and it is united as a whole. Mutual concern for the interests of the democratic camp countries and close economic cooperation are the most important sources of its strength.

The Soviet Union and China have unswervingly implemented the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in February 1950, and have established a broad system of economic and cultural ties between the two sides. Mutually beneficial trade, scientific and technological assistance, cooperation in the development of the national economy, science and culture, cooperation in training cadres, loans, exchange of production experience—these are the basic directions of the ever-increasing fraternal ties between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

The Soviet Union has granted the People's Republic of China long-term loans on preferential terms; and has unconditionally transferred to the government of the People's Republic of China its rights regarding the joint management of the Chinese Changchun Railway and all its affiliated property. The Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies established on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit are working very effectively. The Chinese working people are widely adopting the extremely rich experience accumulated by the Soviet people in political power, economic and cultural construction, and are constantly receiving assistance from Soviet experts who come to China at the request of the Central People's Government.

The Chinese people, led by the glorious Communist Party of China, have made significant achievements in transforming their great country. Chinese peasants have been freed forever from the oppression of landlords for generations and have obtained land. The revolutionary land reform and the elimination of the feudal landlord land ownership system have changed the face of the Chinese countryside. Now, China's agriculture is on the rise. The conditions for China's industrialization and the vigorous development of the productive forces of this great country have been created. China has already been able to produce such important products that used to be imported from foreign countries, such as iron rails, mining equipment, universal milling machines and lathes, generators, and transformers. The first batch of domestically produced locomotives, tractors, automobiles, and motorcycles have been manufactured.

The government of the People's Republic of China has formulated a five-year plan, the basic task of which, as pointed out by the recent meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, is to concentrate all forces on building China's heavy industry and ensuring the continuous growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy. The Five-Year Plan for the development of the economy of the People's Republic of China stipulates the further development of industrial production, and first of all the rapid development of the machine manufacturing industry, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, the fuel and power industry, transportation and agricultural machinery manufacturing. Hundreds of new factories and mines will be established, and new railways will be laid. This year, the total amount of capital construction will increase by 40 percent compared to last year. The total amount of capital construction in Northwest China will increase sixfold. There, 170 major construction sites have already begun construction work. In the process of implementing the Five-Year Plan, and in the process of national industrialization, the worker-peasant alliance will be increasingly consolidated. On the basis of the development of production, the material and cultural standards of the people will continue to improve.

In realizing the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union is and will continue to provide the People's Republic of China with necessary assistance.

The Chinese people widely use Soviet experience in their economic construction. At the beginning of this year, Comrade Mao Zedong called on the Chinese people to learn from the Soviet Union, saying: "We are going to carry out great national construction, the work before us is arduous, and our experience is insufficient, so we must conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Whether inside or outside the Communist Party, old cadres, new cadres, technicians, intellectuals, as well as the masses of workers and peasants, must sincerely learn from the Soviet Union. We must not only study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also study the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must launch a nationwide upsurge of learning from the Soviet Union to build our country."

The Chinese people strengthen the power of the great peace and democracy camp with their outstanding achievements in the struggle for a new life. This camp, which accounts for one-third of the world's population and is closely united, is a powerful and invincible force in the struggle to defend and consolidate world peace.

    伟大的中苏友好同盟
    ——苏联“真理报”九月十八日社论
    今天“真理报”刊载了苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫接见中华人民共和国驻苏联大使张闻天的消息。在接见时，大使将中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东感谢苏联对中华人民共和国经济建设援助的电文呈递格·马·马林科夫。
    苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫同志在接受电文时说，苏联人民为伟大的中国人民在提高他们国家的经济和文化中所取得的成就而欢欣鼓舞。中国经济的进一步发展和工业化的事业有着稳固的基础，并掌握在牢靠的手中。格·马·马林科夫同志说，苏联政府谨祝中华人民共和国繁荣昌盛，谨祝为了我们两国人民、为了巩固和平和国际安全的伟大的中苏友好同盟获得进一步的加强。
    刊载于今天“真理报”上的中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志的电报，是证明中苏两国人民的伟大友谊进一步加强的重要文献。电报中写道：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府委员会，在一九五三年九月十五日举行的会议上，满意地听取了中华人民共和国政府代表团的代表李富春同志所作的关于与苏联政府商谈苏联政府对我国经济建设援助问题的报告。中央人民政府委员会一致认为，由于伟大的苏联政府同意在建设和改建中国的九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建的五十个企业中给以系统的经济的和技术的援助，中国人民将能够在学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术成就的努力之下，逐步地建立起自己的强大的重工业，这对于中国工业化、使中国逐步地过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，都具有极其重大的作用。”
    毛泽东同志代表中国政府和中国人民对于苏联政府和苏联人民的伟大的、全面的、长期的、无私的援助表示衷心的感谢，他说，中国政府和中国人民愿以自己的不懈的努力来加强苏中两国的经济合作和友好同盟，以利为世界和平事业的共同奋斗。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家结成强大的民主和社会主义阵营，它的力量在不断的成长和壮大。社会主义阵营的有决定意义的优越性之一，以及它和帝国主义阵营之间的原则性的区别就在于：它没有内部矛盾和斗争，它是团结成为一个整体的。民主阵营各国利益上的互相的关心和密切的经济合作，就是它取得力量的最重要的源泉。
    苏联和中国始终不渝地执行着一九五○年二月签订的友好同盟互助条约，已经建立了双方经济和文化联系的广泛系统。互利的贸易，科学技术的援助，在发展国民经济、科学和文化中的合作，在培养干部中的合作，贷款，交流生产经验——这些就是苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民日益增长的兄弟联系的基本方针。
    苏联在优惠的条件下给予中华人民共和国长期的贷款；并把自己关于共同管理中国长春铁路及其所属的一切财产的权利，无偿地交给中华人民共和国政府。在完全平等和互利的基础上开办的苏中联合股份公司很有成效地工作着。中国劳动人民正在广泛地采用苏联人民在政权、经济和文化建设方面所积累的极其丰富的经验，经常获得应中央人民政府的请求到中国的苏联专家的帮助。
    光荣的中国共产党所领导的中国人民，在改造自己伟大的国家中获得重大的成就。中国农民永远地摆脱了世世代代的地主压迫，获得了土地。革命的土地改革和封建地主土地占有制的消灭，改变了中国农村的面貌。现在，中国的农业在高涨中。中国工业化和这个伟大国家的生产力量的蓬勃发展的条件已经创造出来了。中国已经能够生产过去要从外国输入的这样一些重要产品，如铁轨、采矿设备、万能铣床和车床、发电机、变压器。第一批本国的机车、拖拉机、汽车和机器脚踏车已经制造出来。
    中华人民共和国政府制订了五年计划，它的基本任务，正如中央人民政府委员会最近一次会议所指出的，是集中一切力量建立中国的重工业，并保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重不断增长。中华人民共和国的发展经济五年计划规定进一步发展工业生产，而首先是迅速发展机器制造业，黑色金属和有色金属冶金业，燃料和电力工业，运输业和农业机器制造业。数百个新的厂矿将建立起来，新的铁路将铺设起来。今年的基本建设总量将比去年增加百分之四十。中国西北的基本建设总量将增加为六倍。那里已有一百七十个大工地开始进行建设工作。在执行五年计划的过程中，在国家工业化的过程中，工农联盟将日益巩固。在发展生产的基础上，人民的物质和文化水平将不断提高。
    在实现五年计划中，苏联正在而且将来还要给予中华人民共和国必需的帮助。
    中国人民在自己的经济建设中广泛地采用苏联的经验。毛泽东同志在今年年初号召中国人民向苏联学习，他说：“我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。无论共产党内、共产党外、老干部、新干部、技术人员、知识分子以及工人群众和农民群众，都必须诚心诚意地向苏联学习。我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。
    中国人民以自己在为新生活而斗争中的卓越成就加强着伟大的和平民主阵营的力量。这个占人类人口三分之一的、紧密地团结一致的阵营，是保卫和巩固世界和平斗争中的有力的、不可战胜的力量。
