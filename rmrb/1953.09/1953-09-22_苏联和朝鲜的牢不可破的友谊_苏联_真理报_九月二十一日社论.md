The talks between the Soviet government and the delegation of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have concluded. The talks were conducted in an atmosphere of sincerity and full mutual understanding.

During the talks, issues related to the further development and strengthening of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as issues related to the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, were discussed. Both sides reached a full understanding that the friendly and cooperative relations already established between the two countries are in the interests of the people of both countries and conducive to consolidating the cause of peace and security in the Far East.

As pointed out in the communique of the Soviet-Korean talks published in "Pravda" on the 20th, both sides reached a consensus that the achievement of the Korean armistice created conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue based on the national unification of Korea, giving the Korean people the opportunity to solve the issue of the Korean national structure themselves. The Soviet government and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expressed their willingness to cooperate with all relevant countries for this purpose.

During the talks, special attention was paid to the issue of how the Soviet Union could provide economic assistance to the Korean people who suffered enormous losses in the war for their independence and freedom. The discussion covered how to use the 1 billion rubles that the Soviet government gratuitously allocated to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the purpose of restoring its war-torn national economy. The aforementioned funds will be used to restore and build a number of the largest industrial enterprises that form the foundation for developing the national economy and improving the material living standards of the working people. At the same time, an agreement was reached on the following: The Soviet Union will supply the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with various equipment and materials, agricultural machinery, tools, fertilizers, purebred breeding stock, and daily necessities; at the same time, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea may postpone the repayment of all previous loans granted by the Soviet Union, and new, more favorable conditions for repaying the aforementioned loans were stipulated.

The Soviet people, together with all progressive humanity, hold deep friendship towards the heroic Korean people who defended their homeland's land from interference.

Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, G.M. Malenkov, said in his speech on September 19: "Today, the word Korean has become a symbol of the great and unwavering national spirit, a symbol of lofty and selfless service for the freedom and independence of the motherland.

The glorious Korean people have written a new and brilliant page in the history of their liberation struggle. This page teaches us that there is no force in the world that can destroy a nation that has taken the destiny of its country into its own hands.

The invincible will, courageous spirit, and heroism of the Korean patriots in the struggle have two sources: the recognition of the profound justice of their cause and the unprecedented solidarity of all progressive humanity with the Korean people."

Peace-loving mankind excitedly regards the selfless assistance of the great Chinese people to the heroic Korean people as a remarkable manifestation of international cooperation. The immortal feats of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers prove that the unity between the people of Asian countries is unbreakable. This is a sign of a new era beginning in the East, a sign of the determination of the Asian people to strive for and safeguard national freedom and independence.

The glorious Korean and Chinese patriots, with their heroic struggle, defended the cause of peace in the East, greatly cooled down the fanaticism of the aggressors who attempted to launch a new world war, and dealt a very effective blow to the reactionary forces' long-term plan to suppress the progressive movements of the people in the Asian and Pacific regions who are embarking on the path of national freedom and independence.

International reactionary forces have not been able to prevent the people of all countries from advancing on the road of progress, nor have they been able to impose humanity's yesterday as its tomorrow. People cannot ignore the fundamental changes that have taken place in the Asian and Pacific regions, changes that have left their mark on the post-war life of more than one billion people in this region. It is no longer possible to isolate the new major power, the People's Republic of China, which pursues a policy aimed at defending peace. Now is the time to abandon the policy that violates common sense and the requirements of historical development, stubbornly believing that it is currently possible to resolve major issues related to the establishment of peace between countries without the great China.

The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is the most important milestone in the struggle of all peace-loving forces in the world against aggression and international adventurism. The armistice vividly proves that as long as all peace-loving forces are persevering, acute international problems can be properly resolved. At the same time, the Korean armistice has also opened the way for the Korean people to achieve national unification and peaceful development.

However, it is clear that the prospect of a thorough and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue does not suit the taste of the American aggressive forces. They are trying to undermine the Korean armistice and worsen the situation in the Asian and Pacific regions.

Therefore, all peace-loving forces today bear an even greater responsibility. They can and must take the Korean armistice as a starting point and make further efforts to further ease international tensions throughout the world (including the East).

Objective conditions enable the progressive social forces in the East to turn Asia into a fortress of peace. The most important of these objective conditions is the international prestige of the People's Republic of China and its policies. The People's Republic of China now appears as a powerful stabilizing factor in the Asian and Pacific regions. China will never again be the object of colonial countries' meat cutting and exploitation. It has not only formally, but also actually, achieved sovereignty and is now pursuing its own independent policy.

The People's Republic of China is a new major power that works together with all peace-loving forces to consolidate peace and international security. This is indeed one of the most important historical results in the international situation in recent decades, a result that not only illuminates the path that has already been traveled, but also illuminates the future.

The Soviet people and peace-loving people all over the world will be pleased to welcome the results of the talks between the Soviet government and the delegation of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They will regard this result as an important step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and ensuring lasting peace in the Far East and the world.

At the same time, the results of the talks are also a major contribution to further strengthening the firm friendship between the Soviet and Korean people. The fraternal relations between the Soviet and Korean people are growing stronger. The Soviet people are pleased that the Korean people have also formed an unbreakable friendship with the great Chinese people.

Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Il-sung, said:

"Today, the most urgent and important task facing our people is to quickly restore and develop the national economy destroyed by the war, restore and improve the material welfare of our people, and further strengthen the material foundation for the peaceful unification of our motherland. These tasks are certainly enormous and arduous.

But there is no doubt that the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, and with the fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the various people's democratic countries, will overcome all difficulties and obstacles and victoriously complete these tasks, just as they achieved victory in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad."

The working people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, under the leadership of the glorious Workers' Party, are launching restoration work in every corner of the country. They cherish the greatest historical achievement – the worker-peasant alliance – like the apple of their eye, constantly consolidate it, and fight victoriously to improve their living conditions.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea embodies the sincere hope of all the Korean people who yearn for the restoration of national unity and peace. It relies on the strong assistance of the Soviet Union to heal the wounds inflicted by the interventionists, and there is no doubt that it will achieve great success in restoring and further developing its economy and culture and in improving the welfare of the working people. The friends of the Korean people in the Soviet Union and throughout the world are confident that Korea will achieve complete peace and embark on the path of comprehensive economic and cultural prosperity.

    苏联和朝鲜的牢不可破的友谊
    ——苏联“真理报”九月二十一日社论
    苏联政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团之间的会谈已经结束了。会谈是在真诚和充分互相谅解的气氛中进行的。
    在会谈过程中讨论了与双方有关的进一步发展与加强苏联和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国之间的友好关系的问题以及与和平解决朝鲜问题有关的问题。双方获致充分谅解，认为：苏朝两国之间已经建立的友好合作关系是符合两国人民的利益并有利于巩固远东和平与安全事业的。
    如二十日在“真理报”上刊载的苏朝会谈公报所指出：双方达到了一致的意见，认为朝鲜停战的达成，创造了一种条件，便于在朝鲜全国统一的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题并给朝鲜人民以自己解决朝鲜国家结构问题的机会。苏联政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府表示愿意为了这个目的而与一切有关国家合作。
    在会谈过程中，特别注意了苏联如何在经济上援助在争取他们的独立与自由的战争中遭受巨大损失的朝鲜人民的问题。讨论了怎样使用苏联政府无代价地拨给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国作为恢复其遭受战争破坏的国民经济之用的十亿卢布的问题。上述款项将用于恢复和建筑许多构成发展国民经济和提高劳动人民生活物质水平的基础的最大的工业企业。同时还达成了如下的协议：苏联供给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国各种设备和器材，农业机器、工具、肥料、纯种公畜，日用必需品；同时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府可延期偿付苏联以前贷予的一切贷款，并规定了清偿上述贷款的新的、更优惠的条件。
    苏联人民和全体进步人类一起，对保卫了自己祖国的土地不受干涉者侵害的英雄的朝鲜人民，怀着深厚的友情。
    苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫在九月十九日的谈话中说：“今天，朝鲜人这个字眼已成为了伟大的刚毅的民族精神的象征，成为了为祖国的自由与独立而从事崇高的忘我的服务的象征。
    光荣的朝鲜人民在解放斗争史上写下了新的灿烂的一页。这一页教导我们：世界上没有一种力量可以摧毁一个已经把国家的命运掌握在自己手里的民族。
    朝鲜的爱国者在斗争中的必胜的意志，勇敢的精神和英雄气概有两个源泉：认识到自己事业的深刻的正义性和全体进步人类与朝鲜人民空前的团结一致。”
    爱好和平的人类兴奋地把伟大中国人民对英勇朝鲜人民的忘我的援助看作是国际合作的卓越表现。英勇的中国人民志愿军的不朽功绩证明：亚洲各国人民之间的团结是牢不可破的。这是在东方开始的新纪元的标志，这是亚洲人民争取并维护民族自由和独立的决心的标志。
    光荣的朝鲜和中国的爱国者以他们的英勇斗争捍卫了东方的和平事业，使力图发动新的世界大战的侵略者的狂热大大冷却下来了，对反动势力的以镇压正在走上民族自由和独立的大道的亚洲及太平洋区域人民的进步运动为目的的长远计划是一个非常有效的打击。
    国际的反动势力没有能够阻止各国人民在进步道路上前进，没有能把人类的昨天当作它的明天强加给人类。人们不能忽视在亚洲和太平洋区域已经发生了根本的变化，这一变化并且在这一地区的十亿以上人口的战后生活中烙了印记。想使实行以保卫和平为目的的政策的新的大国中华人民共和国孤立，已经是不可能的了。现在是时候了，应当放弃那种违反常识和历史发展要求、固执地认为在目前可以没有伟大的中国而解决有关建立各国之间和平的重大问题的政策了。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订是世界一切和平力量反对侵略和国际冒险势力的斗争中的最重要的里程碑。停战生动地证明：只要一切爱好和平的力量能坚忍不拔，尖锐的国际问题是可以获得应有的解决的。同时，朝鲜停战也给朝鲜人民打开了全国统一与和平发展的道路。
    但是，很显然，彻底和平解决朝鲜问题的远景是不适合美国侵略势力的口味的。他们正在力图破坏朝鲜停战，使亚洲和太平洋区域的形势恶化。
    因此，今天一切爱好和平的力量就负有更大的责任。他们可以而且必须以朝鲜的停战为出发点，再作努力，使全世界（包括东方在内）的国际紧张局势进一步缓和。
    客观条件使东方的进步社会力量可以把亚洲变成和平堡垒。这些客观条件中的最重要的一个条件是中华人民共和国的国际威望和它的政策。中华人民共和国现在以强大的稳定因素出现于亚洲和太平洋区域。中国永远不再是殖民国家鱼肉和剥削的对象了。它不仅在形式上，而且在实际上取得了主权，现在并执行着自己的独立自主的政策。
    中华人民共和国是一个新的大国，这个大国跟一切爱好和平的力量在一起，共同为巩固和平与国际安全而努力。这确实是近数十年来国际局势中的一个最重要的历史结果，这个结果不仅照亮了已经走过了的道路，而且也照亮了未来的前程。
    苏联人民和全世界爱好和平的人民将满意地欢迎苏联政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团的会谈结果。他们将认为这个结果是和平解决朝鲜问题和保障远东和全世界持久和平的一个重要步骤。
    同时，会谈结果也是对进一步加强苏朝人民牢固友谊的一个重大贡献。苏联和朝鲜人民之间的兄弟关系日益加强。苏联人民高兴的是：朝鲜人民也与伟大的中国人民结成了牢不可破的友谊。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成说：
    “今天，摆在我国人民面前的刻不容缓的最重要的任务，就是尽速恢复和发展为战争破坏的国民经济，恢复和提高我国人民的物质福利和进一步加强和平统一我们祖国的物质基础。这些任务当然是巨大而繁重的。
    但是毫无疑问，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的兄弟般的援助下，将克服一切困难和障碍，胜利地完成这些任务，就像他们在对国内外敌人进行斗争中取得了胜利一样。”
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的劳动人民，在光荣的劳动党领导下，正在全国各个角落展开恢复工作。他们像爱护眼珠一样爱护最伟大的历史成果——工农联盟，并使之不断巩固，和胜利地为改善自己的生活条件而斗争。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国体现着渴望恢复国家统一、渴望和平的朝鲜全体人民的衷心希望。它依靠着苏联大力帮助，医治着干涉者带给它的创伤，而且毫无疑问，它在恢复和进一步发展本国经济和文化中以及在提高劳动人民的福利方面，一定会获得巨大的成就。朝鲜人民在苏联和在全世界的朋友深信，朝鲜将获得完全的和平，走上经济和文化全面高涨的道路。
