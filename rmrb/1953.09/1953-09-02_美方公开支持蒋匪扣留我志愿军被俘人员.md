Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 31st. Special Correspondent Wu Min reports: It is believed here that the United States' assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in forcibly detaining Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war is another provocative act of undermining the armistice agreement.

On August 26th and 27th, Kuomintang planes sent Kuomintang secret service chief Fang Zhi and other secret agents to Jeju Island for two consecutive days. These secret agents carried photos and letters of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and distributed them in the prisoner-of-war camps with the support and assistance of the United States. A U.S. spokesman said on August 21st that "the United Nations Command does not object and will cooperate within its authority and capability" with these secret agents sent by Chiang Kai-shek from Taiwan.

General Li Sang Cho today presented a second strong protest at the Military Armistice Commission, exposing Chiang Kai-shek's plan to detain prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated and send them to Taiwan with the assistance of the United States. Immediately after the armistice agreement was signed, the U.S. military authorities distributed Chiang Kai-shek's statement in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camps, threatening prisoners of war not to request repatriation.

Brigadier General Bryan, the senior U.S. member of the Military Armistice Commission, maintained a three-week guilty silence regarding General Li Sang Cho's first strong protest against this violation of the armistice agreement, thereby condoning Chiang Kai-shek's implementation of his plan.

This violation of the armistice agreement is all the more serious because the U.S. military authorities deliberately obstructed the Joint Red Cross team from visiting the prisoner-of-war camps in South Korea, and effectively prevented the Korean-Chinese Red Cross personnel from completing their humanitarian services in accordance with the armistice terms. Three Neutral Nations Inspection Teams have been sent to South Korea to investigate the U.S. obstruction of the Joint Red Cross team's visit.

The fact that the U.S. military authorities used violence against Korean-Chinese Red Cross personnel to prevent them from completing their humanitarian services, while brazenly violating the armistice agreement and "cooperating within their authority and capability" with Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, provides evidence of the U.S.'s lack of sincerity. The United Nations Command members of the Military Armistice Commission are abetting this violation of the armistice agreement by maintaining a guilty silence.

These repeated violations of the armistice agreement by the U.S. are clearly part of a broad plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war at the last moment and undermine the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which is scheduled to begin its mission in September. U.S. and Lee Syngman troops are inflicting new wounds on returning prisoners of war, forcing them to renounce repatriation before they reach Panmunjom. Prisoners of war who have been repatriated from various prisoner-of-war camps say that they were forced to pass through what they called "threat zones" before repatriation, the purpose of which was to intimidate them and dissuade them from returning home. Those who insisted on repatriation were beaten with rifle butts or wounded by gas grenades.

A few prisoners of war who managed to escape from the prisoner-of-war camps where non-directly repatriated prisoners of war are being held have returned to Kaesong. They said that Chiang Kai-shek and Lee Syngman's secret agents are intensifying their activities to intimidate prisoners of war and make them give up their right to repatriation. These secret agents are coercing prisoners of war to discuss plans to undermine the interpretation work stipulated in the armistice agreement. One of these plans stipulates forcing prisoners of war to "escape" on the way to the demilitarized zone and while under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents' recent visit to the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camps with U.S. cooperation is clearly intended to intensify these terror activities before the prisoners of war are handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for supervision.

### 美方公开支持蒋匪扣留我志愿军被俘人员

    美方公开支持蒋匪扣留我志愿军被俘人员
    【新华社开城三十一日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：这里认为，美国协助蒋介石特务分子进行强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员的阴谋，是破坏停战协定的另一项挑衅行动。
    国民党飞机在八月二十六日和二十七日，连续两天把国民党特务头子方治和其他特务分子送到济州岛，这些特务分子带着卖国贼蒋介石的照片和信件，在美国的支持和协助下在战俘营中散发。一个美方发言人曾在八月二十一日说：“联军司令部并不反对，并将在它的权限和能力范围内”与蒋介石由台湾派来的这些特务分子“合作”。
    李相朝将军今天在军事停战委员会上提出的第二次强硬抗议，揭露了蒋介石在美国协助下扣留不直接遣返战俘并把他们送到台湾的计划。就在停战协定刚刚签订后，美国军事当局在济州岛战俘营中散发了蒋介石的声明，威胁战俘们不得要求遣返。
    军事停战委员会美方首席委员勃里安，对李相朝将军对这种违反停战协定行动所提出的第一次强硬抗议，保持了三星期的罪恶的缄默，从而纵容蒋介石实施他的计划。
    由于美国军事当局故意阻挠联合红十字会小组访问在南朝鲜的战俘营，并使朝中红十字会人员实际上不能按照停战条款完成他们人道主义的服务，这种违反停战协定的行为就更其严重了。三个中立国视察小组已被派到南朝鲜去调查美方阻挠联合红十字会小组访问的行动。
    美国军事当局一方面对朝中红十字会人员使用暴力，以阻止他们完成人道主义的服务，同时却悍然违反了停战协定，“在权限和能力范围内”与蒋介石特务分子进行“合作”，这种事实提供了美方没有诚意的证据。军事停战委员会的联合国军方面的委员们正在用保持罪恶的缄默的办法来助长这种违反停战协定的行动。
    美方这种一再违反停战协定的行动，显然只是在最后一刻强迫扣留战俘、并破坏定于九月间开始执行任务的中立国遣返委员会工作的广泛计划的一部分。美军和李承晚军队在正要回来的被俘人员身上加上新的伤痕，使他们在即将前往板门店之前放弃遣返。从各战俘营中被遣返回来的被俘人员，都说他们在遣返前被迫通过他们所说的“威胁区”，其目的在于恐吓他们，使他们不要回家。那些坚持遣返的人，遭到了枪托的殴打，或被毒气手榴弹击伤。
    从拘留不直接遣返的战俘的战俘营中设法逃出来的少数被俘人员，已回到了开城，他们说蒋介石和李承晚的特务分子正加紧活动，恐吓战俘们，使他们放弃遣返的权利。这些特务分子威逼战俘们讨论破坏停战协定所规定的解释工作的计划。其中的一个计划，规定强迫战俘在前往非军事区途中和在中立国遣返委员会看管下“逃跑”。蒋介石特务分子在美国的合作下最近到济州岛战俘营里去访问，显然就是要在战俘们被交给中立国遣返委员会看管之前加紧这些恐怖活动。
