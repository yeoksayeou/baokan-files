    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 9th: The Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on September 9th.
    Li Xiangchao, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side, once again firmly demanded that the United Nations Command provide a clear and responsible explanation regarding its forcible detention of large numbers of captured North Korean and Chinese personnel.
    Li Xiangchao pointed out: Shortly after both sides signed the terms of reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Syngman Rhee government and army of the United Nations Command forcibly detained more than 27,000 captured North Korean and Chinese personnel. In response, General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, repeatedly stated that efforts would be made to recover them, but no explanation has been given to date. It must be emphasized and reminded to the other side that the Korean-Chinese side has never considered this matter to be concluded. The United Nations Command must provide an explanation for this incident involving more than 27,000 of our captured personnel. Even during the process of repatriating prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation under the custody of both sides, the United Nations Command did not abandon its attempt to forcibly detain captured North Korean and Chinese personnel. On August 13th, the U.S. Secretary of the Army publicly announced the forcible detention of 250 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who insisted on repatriation, of which at least 112 are still under the forcible detention of the United Nations Command. Furthermore, among the three lists of 644 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who insisted on repatriation submitted by the Korean-Chinese side to the United Nations Command on September 2nd, 3rd, and 5th, according to the verification by the Korean-Chinese side, 228 have still not been repatriated. Li Xiangchao emphasized and reminded the United Nations Command that it cannot escape the serious responsibility it should bear for the above-mentioned un-repatriated captured personnel of our side at any time.
    Rear Admiral Daniel B. Brewster, Senior Member of the United Nations Command, did not provide a clear and responsible explanation at the meeting regarding the captured North Korean and Chinese personnel forcibly detained by the United Nations Command. On the contrary, he presented a so-called list of United Nations Command captured personnel who might still be in the hands of the Korean-Chinese side, saying that he wanted the Korean-Chinese side to provide an explanation. Li Xiangchao then pointed out that the Korean-Chinese side had completely repatriated all captured personnel of the United Nations Command who insisted on repatriation on September 6th, and would soon release all captured personnel of the United Nations Command who requested not to be directly repatriated to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The counter-list presented by the United Nations Command was merely to confuse the public and cover up its crime of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.
    At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on September 9th, Li Xiangchao also raised the incident of the Swedish members of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team stationed in Daegu being beaten by United Nations Command personnel, based on the letter from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to the Military Armistice Commission on September 8th. Li Xiangchao pointed out that according to the express provisions of the Armistice Agreement, both sides have the obligation of providing full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its inspection teams. All personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission shall enjoy the privileges and immunities enjoyed by accredited diplomatic personnel in accordance with international practice. The unreasonable and tyrannical actions of the United Nations Command personnel against the members of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team in Daegu violated the relevant clauses of the Armistice Agreement and were an insult to the entire Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.
    Li Xiangchao firmly demanded that the United Nations Command immediately take practical and effective measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again and to ensure the thorough implementation of the relevant clauses of the Armistice Agreement.

    美方强迫扣留大批朝中被俘人员
    李相朝中将再一次要求美方作负责的交代
    【新华社开城九日电】九月九日朝鲜军事停战委员会举行会议。
    朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将，再一次坚决要求联合国军方面，就它所强迫扣留的大批朝中被俘人员向朝中方面作明白负责的交代。
    李相朝中将指出：在双方签订中立国遣返委员会的职权范围后不久，联合国军方面的李承晚政府和军队，即强制扣留了二万七千余名朝中被俘人员。对此，联合国军总司令克拉克曾一再声明努力追回，但至今未作任何交代，必须强调提醒对方，朝中方面绝未认为此次事件已告结束，联合国军必须对此次牵涉二万七千余名我方被俘人员的事件作出交代。即在此次遣返双方收容下坚持遣返的战俘之过程中，联合国军方面也未放弃强迫扣留朝中被俘人员的企图。八月十三日，美国陆军部长曾公开宣布强制扣留了二百五十名坚持遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，其中至少尚有一百十二名至今仍处于联合国军方面强制扣留之下。而九月二日、三日及五日，朝中方面所先后向联合国军方面提出的包括六百四十四名坚持遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员的三次名单中，根据朝中方面的查对，也仍有二百二十八名尚未被遣返。李相朝中将强调提醒联合国军方面，对于上述未被遣返的我方被俘人员，联合国军方面在任何时候都不能逃脱它所应负的严重责任。
    联合国军方面首席委员勃里安少将，在会上并没有就联合国军方面所强迫扣留的朝中被俘人员作出明白负责的交代。反之，却提出一个所谓可能现仍在朝中方面手中的联合国军被俘人员的名单，说是要朝中方面交代。李相朝中将乃指出：朝中方面已于九月六日全部遣返完毕一切坚持遣返的联合国军被俘人员，并即将把所有要求不直接遣返的联合国军被俘人员一律释交中立国遣返委员会。联合国军方面所提出的反名单，只是为了要混淆视听，借以掩饰其强迫扣留战俘的罪行。
    在九月九日的军事停战委员会上，李相朝中将还根据九月八日中立国监察委员会给军事停战委员会的信件，提出了驻扎大邱的中立国视察小组的瑞典组员遭受联合国军工作人员殴打的事件。李相朝中将指出：根据停战协定的明文规定，双方有义务对中立国监察委员会及其中立国视察小组，给予充分保护及一切可能的协助与合作。中立国监察委员会的一切人员，并享有被认可的外交人员按照国际惯例所享有的特权待遇与豁免。联合国军人员此次对大邱的中立国视察小组组员所进行的无理横暴行为，破坏了停战协定的上述有关条款，是对于整个中立国监察委员会的侮辱。
    李相朝中将坚决要求联合国军方面立即采取实际有效措施，使类似事件不再发生，保证停战协定有关条款的彻底实施。
