    Primary School Teachers Should Not Assign Elementary School Students to Do Work for Them
    Ya Mi and Wei Zhagen from the Second District Public Office of Huguan County, Shanxi Province, wrote: Liu Zhenbao, a primary school teacher in Huangshan Village in our district, often assigns students to farm and do chores for him. In March of this year, he secretly took two students home to plant corn for him, affecting the students' studies for two days. The village chief knew about it and gave him suggestions, but he still didn't correct it. In mid-May, he took four more students home to pull seedlings. Before dawn, he ordered the students to go to the fields to work, and they worked until dark, and he didn't even let the students eat their fill. This time, the four students worked for him for six days without pay, and the parents were very dissatisfied. Liu Zhenbao should make a profound self-criticism for this behavior that disregards students' studies and damages their health.

    小学教员不应该支派小学生替他干活
    山西省壶关县二区区公所雅弥、魏扎根来信：我区黄山村小学教员刘振保经常支派学生替他种地干活。今年三月间他私下带了两个学生回家替他栽种玉茭，影响了学生两天的学习。村长知道后向他提意见，他仍不改正。五月中，他又带了四个学生回家拔苗。天还没有亮，他就叫学生下田干活，一直干到天黑，而且还不让学生吃饱饭。这次四个学生无代价地替他干了六天活，家长们都很不满意。刘振保对这种不顾学生学习和损害学生健康的行为，应作深刻检讨。
