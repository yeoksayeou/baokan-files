    Film screening units in Shenyang improve operational management
    Under the leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Culture, film personnel in Shenyang, after listening to the transmitted reports from the "National Film Screening Network Management Training Conference" and studying the work experience of Soviet rural screening teams, have universally improved their understanding of screening work and improved the operational management of screening units. The city's film education work teams have established a "zonal contract system" for each team, and each team has formulated a "touring work route chart." Among the 600,000 people in the suburbs, fixed screening areas and locations will be gradually established, so that farmers can see films regularly in a planned manner. The city's eleven state-run cinemas and four private cinemas have also reformed various systems according to their specific conditions. At present, cinemas in the city have abolished the preferential treatment for public security personnel and the preferential treatment for union members on Sunday mornings; in order to protect the physical and mental health of young children, children under one meter tall are prohibited from entering; at the same time, in order to allow children to see films, three state-run cinemas have added children's matinees. From August 1st, a system of dividing cinemas into grades based on the quality of cinema equipment to determine ticket prices has been implemented. A reserved seating system has been implemented in first-class cinemas, and preferential group ticket prices have been reasonably adjusted.
    The Northeast holds film screening cadre training classes
    In order to train film screening cadres, the Cultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee, after seven months of preparation, opened a film screening cadre training class in Jilin City. The training class brought together more than 200 students from six provinces and five cities in the Northeast region, and officially opened on August 15th. Through six months of technical and political studies, the training class will enable students to become projectionists who skillfully master projection technology and propagandists with a high level of political awareness, and will go to various parts of the Northeast to assist in carrying out film education work in the Northeast region.
