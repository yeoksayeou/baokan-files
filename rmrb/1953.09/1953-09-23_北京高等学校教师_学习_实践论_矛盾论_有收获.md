Beijing's higher education teachers, under the leadership of the Beijing Higher Education Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, studied "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" from April to July this year. More than 6,500 teachers and some staff members from universities and colleges across the city participated in the study (excluding Renmin University of China). The teachers' enthusiasm for learning has always been high. Generally, they were able to carefully study the documents, and many teachers also took notes and wrote study心得 [xīndé - notes/ reflections].

After this study, the teachers had a preliminary understanding of the content of materialism and dialectics. After studying "On Practice," everyone realized that all objective things have certain laws of development, and criticized past idealist ideas such as "social phenomena are ever-changing, chaotic and without certain laws" and "heroes create the times." Many people realized that an important reason why their past work was not done well was that they did not recognize that there were objective laws in the work, and often acted according to subjective wishes. After the teachers understood the correct relationship between knowledge and practice, they realized that most of their past knowledge came from books and lacked practical experience; they also realized that one-sidedly emphasizing the role of abstract thinking in scientific research work was wrong. Many people also combined their work and study to conduct a more in-depth examination of the phenomenon of "theory being divorced from practice," and further realized that research work must be closely integrated with practice in order to achieve better results. Some teachers in science and engineering colleges used to think that natural scientists were thorough materialists, but now they are beginning to realize that bourgeois idealist views often invade the field of natural science. For example, after some teachers at Beijing Agricultural University studied "On Practice," they saw more clearly the reactionary nature of Morgan's theory and improved their understanding of Michurin's theory.

The study of "On Contradiction" enabled everyone to realize the law of contradiction that universally exists in objective things, and also to realize that "only by acknowledging contradictions, analyzing contradictions, and resolving contradictions can we move forward." Many teachers realized that their past views on many issues were wrong because they were influenced by metaphysical thinking. Some teachers also criticized the metaphysical thinking in the teaching content. They more deeply realized that dialectics is the correct method of analyzing things and a powerful weapon for scientific research work.

After studying, the teachers also found a way to learn from the Soviet Union's reform of teaching work. After studying dialectical materialism, they improved their understanding of the superiority of Soviet textbooks, thereby generally increasing the teachers' enthusiasm for learning Soviet textbooks. At the same time, they also had a further understanding of how to better learn Soviet textbooks. A teacher at Beijing Agricultural University said: "Now I feel that without the correct standpoint, viewpoint and method, it is impossible to truly understand the essence of Soviet textbooks." The teachers felt that after learning the theory, they improved their ability to criticize British and American textbooks.

The study of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" further improved the teachers' understanding of the importance of studying political theory, and laid a good foundation for long-term, systematic political theory study in the future. In the past, many teachers' understanding of Marxist-Leninist theory was extremely vague, thinking that Marxism-Leninism was just a "subject." After studying "On Practice," they knew that Marxist-Leninist theory is a guide for revolutionary struggle, and it is the universal truth that correctly reflects the objective world. Many teachers gradually realized that Marxism-Leninism is a powerful weapon for improving thought and guiding practical work. Teachers who study natural science also began to realize that Marxism-Leninism is the foundation of scientific research work, and workers in any natural science field must study it.

Facts have proved that only by gradually mastering the theoretical weapons of Marxism-Leninism can teachers consciously and deeply criticize bourgeois ideology. At the beginning of the study, many cadres did not have a sufficient understanding of this point. They wanted to solve the problem with simple methods of "criticism" and "self-criticism," but the results were not as expected.

In this study, ideological leadership was still insufficient, and no in-depth analysis and research was conducted on the teachers' ideological situation. Therefore, the essential central issues were often not grasped in the discussion. For example, when studying "On Contradiction," some teachers ignored the main content of "On Contradiction" and talked a lot about contradictory phenomena in nature, or entangled themselves in the concept of "contradiction," thus causing the study to take a detour. In the discussion outlines of various schools, it was not clearly stated what problems should be solved in each stage, and sometimes some problems that were divorced from reality were put forward for everyone to discuss, so the results were not great. The Party committees of many schools did not seriously discuss the above issues. In the future, we should focus on cadre study and the analysis and research of teachers' thoughts, strengthen the specific leadership of the Party committee over the work of the Academic Committee, and overcome the above shortcomings. Secondly, not enough attention was paid to the learning situation of young teachers, and no research was done on the special problems they raised in the study, and no due assistance was given.

### 北京高等学校教师  学习“实践论”“矛盾论”有收获

    北京高等学校教师
    学习“实践论”“矛盾论”有收获
    北京市高等学校教师，在中共北京市高等学校委员会的领导下，从今年四月到七月学习了“实践论”和“矛盾论”。参加学习的有全市高等学校的教师和部分职员共六千五百余人（中国人民大学除外）。各校教师学习的情绪始终是饱满的。一般都能认真钻研文件，有不少教师还作了笔记，写了学习心得。
    经过这次学习以后，教师们对唯物主义理论和辩证法的内容有了初步的认识。学习了“实践论”，大家认识到一切客观事物都有一定的发展规律，批判了过去认为“社会现象千变万化，杂乱无章，没有一定规律”和“英雄造时势”等唯心思想。很多人认识到过去工作做不好的重要原因在于不承认工作中有客观规律，往往根据主观愿望办事。教师们了解了认识和实践的正确关系后，认识到自己过去的知识大都来自书本，缺乏实际经验；也认识到科学研究工作中片面强调抽象的思考作用是不对的。很多人还联系工作和学习，比较深刻地检查了“理论脱离实际”的现象，进一步认识到研究工作必须密切结合实践，才能有更好的成就。一部分理工学院的教师过去认为自然科学工作者是彻头彻尾的唯物论者，现在开始认识到资产阶级的唯心论观点也往往侵入到自然科学的领域。例如北京农业大学的一些教师在学了“实践论”以后，更清楚地看到了摩尔根学说的反动性，提高了对米丘林学说的认识。
    “矛盾论”的学习，使大家认识到客观事物中普遍存在着的矛盾法则，也认识到“只有承认矛盾、分析矛盾、解决矛盾，才能前进”。不少教师认识到过去对很多问题看法有错误，都是因为受形而上学思想的影响。有一些教师还批判了教学内容中的形而上学思想。他们更加体会到辩证法是正确分析事物的方法，是科学研究工作的有力武器。
    教师们经过学习以后，也找到了学习苏联改革教学工作的门径。他们学习了辩证唯物论后，提高了自己对苏联教材的优越性的认识，因而普遍提高了教师们学习苏联教材的积极性。同时，对如何更好地学习苏联教材也有了进一步的体会。北京农业大学有一个教师说：“现在感到没有正确的立场、观点和方法，是不能真正领会苏联教材的实质的。”教师们感到学了理论，提高了对英美教材的批判能力。
    “实践论”“矛盾论”的学习，进一步提高了教师们对学习政治理论的重要性的认识，并为今后长期的、系统的政治理论学习奠定了一个良好的基础。过去很多教师对马克思列宁主义理论学习的认识是极为模糊的，以为马克思列宁主义只不过是一门“学问”。学了“实践论”之后，他们知道马克思列宁主义理论是革命斗争的指南，它是正确地反映客观世界的普遍真理。很多教师逐渐体会到马克思列宁主义是提高思想指导实际工作的有力武器。研究自然科学的教师，也开始认识到马克思列宁主义是科学研究工作的基础，任何一门自然科学的工作者都必须学习。
    事实证明：只有使教师们逐步掌握马克思列宁主义的理论武器，他们才有可能自觉地和深入地批判资产阶级思想。在学习开始时，许多干部对这一点认识不足，他们想用简单的“批判”“检讨”方式解决问题，结果收不到应有的效果。
    在这次学习中，思想领导还很不够，没有深入地对教师的思想情况进行分析研究。因此在讨论中常常抓不着本质的中心问题。例如学习“矛盾论”时，有些教师竟撇开“矛盾论”的主要内容，说了很多自然界的矛盾现象，或纠缠于“矛盾”的概念，因而使学习走了一段弯路。在各校的讨论提纲中，每阶段要解决什么问题，说得不够明确，有时提出一些脱离实际的问题让大家进行讨论，因而收到的效果不大。很多学校的党委对上述问题也没有认真地进行讨论。今后应抓紧干部学习和对教师思想的分析研究工作，加强党委对学委会工作的具体领导，克服上述缺点。其次，对年青教师的学习情况也注意得不够，没有研究他们在学习中所提出的特殊问题，给以应有的帮助。
