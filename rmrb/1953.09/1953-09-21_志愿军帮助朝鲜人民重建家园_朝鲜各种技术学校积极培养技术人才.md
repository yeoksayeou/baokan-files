Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, September 20th: The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) recently issued a circular instructing all CPV units to assist the Korean people in treating diseases, providing relief to disaster-stricken people, restoring production, rebuilding their homes, and enhancing the combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. The "Volunteer Army News," published by the leading organ of the CPV, recently published an editorial entitled "Enhancing Solidarity with the Korean People," calling on all commanders and fighters to heighten their vigilance, stand fast at their posts, and guard against new enemy plots of aggression. At the same time, they must continue to strengthen internationalist solidarity with the Korean people as an important task.

In accordance with the instructions of the Political Department of the CPV and the call of the "Volunteer Army News," many CPV units have recently held meetings to plan and arrange various tasks to help the Korean people rebuild their homes and restore production. A certain unit of the CPV on the western front decided at a meeting to organize troops to vigorously assist the Korean people in the autumn harvest and the repair of houses, and to help the Korean people solve various difficulties in restoring production. The political department of a certain unit of the CPV guarding the west coast conducted a general inspection of the work of helping the Korean people rebuild their homes within the army at the end of August. It instructed all units to assist the local Korean government in repairing the destroyed schools in the garrison area as soon as possible, so that students could enroll in time.

A certain unit of the CPV on the eastern front has made great achievements in actively helping the Korean people rebuild their homes and restore production since the Korean armistice. Commanders and fighters braved the scorching sun and heavy rain to cut grass and accumulate fertilizer for Korean farmers, and female comrades in many unit organs also actively participated. One unit cut more than 100,000 catties of grass for farmers in three villages and built two small school buildings that could accommodate more than 100 students. A certain unit also allocated 100 vehicles to help the local Korean government transport building materials, transporting 600,000 catties of timber to a certain county in ten days.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, September 19th: Since the Korean armistice, various units of the CPV near the war zone have helped the Korean people build many school buildings. A certain unit of the CPV on the Iron Triangle front helped the local Korean people build two middle schools and eight primary schools in less than two months. A certain unit of the CPV on the eastern front also helped the Korean people build several schools. These schools were all destroyed by American aggressor aircraft during the war.

The commanders and fighters of the CPV have demonstrated a high degree of internationalism in building school buildings. When building the largest school in Ichon County—the Sixth Middle School—Li Zhiming, deputy director of the political department of a certain unit of the CPV, personally went to the construction site to lead the construction. Commanders and fighters braved the heavy rain, worked day and night, and built ten large classrooms that could accommodate 450 students in a few days. A certain unit of the CPV on the front line of Pyonggang County not only helped residents build two primary schools, but also donated school supplies to Korean orphans in the schools. A certain unit of the CPV that participated in the Battle of Kumsong, after being rotated from the front line, cooperated with the local Korean government to help the Korean people in Changdo County build the Changdo County No. 1 Middle School, which was completely destroyed by the American aggressor army. New classrooms, offices, lounges, and student dormitories were built in a short period of time, and a spacious and flat playground was opened up for the students.

Now, these schools have opened one after another. The Korean people expressed their deep gratitude to the selfless assistance of the CPV. At the opening ceremony of Changdo County No. 1 Middle School, Principal Li Jong-ho said: "American imperialism destroyed our school, and the Chinese People's Volunteers helped us build it. When all the teachers and students of our school enter and leave the new school buildings every day, when our new students enroll and graduating students leave school, we will always remember the profound internationalist friendship of the Chinese People's Volunteers!"

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 19th: In order to meet the needs of national reconstruction and vigorously train technical personnel, the State Construction Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea immediately began to reorganize and expand technical schools and construction personnel training institutes at all levels after the armistice. At present, some technical schools have officially opened, and more than 1,300 workers are receiving education in these schools. The Central Construction Personnel and Cadre Training Institute is also training many technicians and administrative cadres through short-term training methods.

Two construction vocational schools in Jaeryong County, Hwanghae Province, and Bukcheong County, Hamgyongnam Province, have opened, and the number of new students enrolled this year is more than twice that of last year. The two-year staff school and the one-year design draftsman training institute newly established in Pyongyang will officially open on October 1. The five-year Construction University will also open on October 1. This Construction University will enroll more than 400 new students this year. The university has departments of bridges, tunnels, and hydropower, and is affiliated with a three-year industrial cadre department and a two-year design cadre training institute. In addition, construction vocational schools will be established in Pyongyang and Sinuiju in mid-October.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 15th: Farmers in various parts of northern Korea are now actively engaged in the autumn harvest, harvesting millet, corn, sorghum, early rice, and other crops. This year, millet, corn and other crops in South Pyongan Province, Kaesong area and other places are estimated to exceed the harvests of previous bumper years.

In order to ensure the timely completion of the autumn harvest and the payment of tax in kind, farmers in various places have formulated autumn harvest plans before the autumn harvest and made full preparations, preparing farm tools such as sickles and straw bags for storing grain in advance. For example, farmers in the suburbs of Nampo City and Ryonggang County, South Pyongan Province, began harvesting millet and corn from mid-August, and the harvested area has now completed more than 50%. After the harvest, many farmers have begun to pay tax in kind to the government in a timely manner to support the country's reconstruction work.

    志愿军帮助朝鲜人民重建家园
    朝鲜各种技术学校积极培养技术人才
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十日电】中国人民志愿军政治部最近发布通报，指示志愿军各部队协助朝鲜人民医治疾病，救济受灾人民，恢复生产和重建家园，增进中朝人民的战斗友谊。中国人民志愿军领导机关出版的“志愿军报”最近以“增进与朝鲜人民的团结”为题发表社论，号召全体指挥员、战斗员在提高警惕，坚守岗位，防备敌人新的侵略阴谋的同时，必须将继续增进与朝鲜人民间的国际主义团结作为当前的重要任务。
    根据中国人民志愿军政治部的指示和“志愿军报”的号召，志愿军许多部队已在最近召开了会议，有计划地布置帮助朝鲜人民重建家园，恢复生产的各项工作。西线志愿军某部在会议上决定组织部队大力帮助朝鲜人民进行秋收和修盖房屋，并且帮助朝鲜人民解决在恢复生产中的各种困难。守卫在西海岸上的志愿军某部政治部八月底在该部全军范围内普遍检查了帮助朝鲜人民重建家园的工作，并指示各部队协助当地朝鲜政府早日修复驻区内各大村镇被毁的学校，使学生能及时入学。
    东线的中国人民志愿军某部在朝鲜停战后，积极帮助朝鲜人民重建家园和恢复生产已经取得较大成绩。指挥员战斗员们冒着烈日和大雨为朝鲜农民割草积肥，许多部队机关的女同志也积极参加。有一个单位给三个里的农民割草十多万斤，修建了两所可容一百多学生的小学校舍。某部还调拨汽车一百辆帮助当地朝鲜政府运输建筑器材，在十天中就给某郡运送木材六十万斤。
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】朝鲜停战以来，中国人民志愿军临近战区各部队帮助朝鲜人民修建了许多所学校校舍。铁原前线志愿军某部在不到两个月的时间内，就帮助当地朝鲜人民修建了两所中学校、八所小学校。东线的志愿军某部也帮助朝鲜人民修建了好几所学校。这些学校都是在战争期间被美国侵略者的飞机炸毁的。
    中国人民志愿军指挥员和战斗员们在修建学校校舍时都表现了高度的国际主义精神。修建伊川郡最大的一所学校——第六中学时，志愿军某部政治处副主任李志明亲赴工地领导施工。指挥员、战斗员们冒着大雨，昼夜不停地工作，在数天内就建筑起能容四百五十名学生的十个大教室。平康郡前线志愿军某部除帮助居民修建了两所小学外，还捐学习用品给学校中的朝鲜孤儿。曾经参加金城反击战的志愿军某部从前沿阵地上换防下来后，就协同当地朝鲜政府帮助昌道郡的朝鲜人民修建了被美国侵略军毁坏殆尽的昌道郡第一中学校。在短时期内修建了新的课堂、办公室、休息室和学生宿舍，并且为学生们开辟了一块宽阔平整的操场。
    现在，这些学校已经陆续开学。朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军无私的援助表示深切的感谢。昌道郡第一中学校的开学典礼上，校长李锺浩说：“美帝国主义破坏了我们的学校，中国人民志愿军帮助我们建设起来。当我们全校师生每天出入在新校舍的时候，当我们新的学生入学和毕业同学离校的时候，我们将永远记着中国人民志愿军国际主义的深厚友情！”
    【新华社平壤十九日电】为了适应国家恢复建设的需要，大力培养技术人才，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国家建设委员会在停战以后立即着手整理和扩大各级技术学校和建设人员养成所。目前有些技术学校已经正式开学，已有一千三百多名工人在这些学校里受教育。中央建设人员干部养成所也正在用短期训练的办法培养着很多技术人员和行政干部。
    在黄海道载宁郡和咸镜南道北青郡的两个建设专科学校已经开学，今年招收的新生超过去年度的两倍。在平壤新创办的二年制的职工学校和一年制的设计绘图员养成所，将于十月一日正式开学。五年制的建设大学也将在十月一日开学。这所建设大学今年将招收新生四百多名，该大学内设有桥梁、隧道及水力等学部，并附设三年制的产业干部学部和二年制的设计干部养成所。另外，十月中旬将分别在平壤和新义州创办建设专科学校。
    【新华社平壤十五日电】朝鲜北部各地农民现正积极进行秋收，收割谷子、玉米、高粱、早稻等作物。今年，平安南道、开城地区等地的谷子，玉米等农作物，估计都将超过往年丰年的收成。
    各地农民们为了保证及时地完成秋收和缴纳现物税的工作，在秋收以前就订出了秋收计划，并作了充分准备，事前准备好镰刀等农具和装粮食用的草袋。例如，平安南道南浦市郊区和龙冈郡农民从八月中旬即开始收割谷子和玉米，收割面积现已完成了百分之五十以上。有很多农民在收割完毕后，已开始向政府缴纳现物税，及时支援国家的恢复建设工作。
