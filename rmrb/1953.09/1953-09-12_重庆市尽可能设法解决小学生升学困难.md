Under the deep concern of the Party and the People's Government, Chongqing's educational undertakings have greatly developed in the past four years. The number of elementary school students in the city has now reached 146,461, an increase of 66,951 compared with the 79,510 elementary school students in the city at the time of liberation, an increase of more than 84 percent. The number of middle school students in the city has now reached 29,651, an increase of 16,913 compared with the 12,738 middle school students in the city at the time of liberation, an increase of more than onefold. Despite this, existing schools still cannot meet the actual needs.

In this year's unified enrollment of Chongqing's secondary schools in August, despite the difficulties of a lack of teachers and insufficient school buildings, all possible efforts were made to increase the enrollment quota. This year, 6,300 new junior high school students were enrolled, an increase of 40 percent compared with the 4,481 new junior high school students enrolled last year. Due to the large number of elementary school graduates in the two semesters of the 1952 academic year, and the increase in the number of elementary school graduates from other places coming to Chongqing to take the junior high school entrance examination compared with last year, the total number of applicants reached more than 15,000. Therefore, although 6,300 people were enrolled, more than 9,000 people still failed to be admitted. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chongqing Municipal People's Government are very concerned about and attach great importance to this issue, and have held special meetings. After careful study, based on Chongqing's specific conditions and various factors, the following measures have been decided to be adopted to solve the problem as much as possible:

(1) Based on the conditions of teachers and school buildings, add more classes for the first semester of junior high school in some secondary schools, mainly using the method of two-part day school system to solve the problem of school building shortages. A certain number of elementary school graduates will be admitted from the junior high school candidates who failed the unified enrollment according to certain score standards. (2) Run night middle schools in areas with dense populations using the original school buildings, and enroll elementary school graduates with certain score standards according to certain regulations. (3) Assist people who are enthusiastic about education to run private middle schools. (4) Run tutoring classes in elementary schools with suitable conditions in various districts, focusing on tutoring elementary school courses, and absorb as many elementary school graduates who have failed to enter junior high school as possible. (5) Elementary school graduates with poor grades who cannot enter higher education may, according to certain regulations, be allowed to return to the sixth grade of the school to continue their studies on a voluntary basis, provided that the original school can accommodate them.

    重庆市尽可能设法解决小学生升学困难
    在党和人民政府的深切关怀下，四年来，重庆市教育事业有了很大的发展。全市小学生，现已达到十四万六千四百六十一人，较解放时全市小学生七万九千五百一十人，增加了六万六千九百五十一人，即增加百分之八十四强。全市中学生，现已达到二万九千六百五十一人，比解放时全市中学生一万二千七百三十八人，增加了一万六千九百一十三人，增加一倍多。尽管如此，现有学校仍不能适应实际的需要。
    重庆市各中等学校本年八月举行的一次统一招生，在师资缺乏、校舍不足的困难情况下，仍尽一切可能，增加了招生任务。今年招收初中新生六千三百人，较去年招收初中新生四千四百八十一人，增加了百分之四十。由于一九五二年学年度两个学期的小学毕业生人数太多，而外地到重庆市来投考初中的小学毕业生，又较去年有所增加，投考人数共达一万五千余人。因此，虽然招收了六千三百人，仍然有九千余人未能录取。对于这一问题，中共重庆市委和重庆市人民政府非常关怀和重视，曾召开了专门会议，经过缜密研究，根据重庆市的具体情况和各项条件，决定采用下列措施，尽可能地进行解决：
  （一）根据师资、校舍条件，在部分中等学校增设初中一上的班次，主要是用走读二部制的办法解决校舍困难，从本届统一招生未录取的初中考生中，根据一定的分数标准，录取一定数量的小学毕业生入学。（二）在人口集中的地区利用原校舍开办夜中学，按照一定的规定，吸收一定分数标准的小学毕业生入学。（三）协助热心教育事业的人士开办私立中学。（四）在各区有条件的小学中办补习班，重点补习小学的课程，尽可能吸收一些未能考入初中的小学毕业生入学。（五）成绩过差、不能升学的小学毕业生，按一定的规定，在原校可容纳的情况下，以自愿为原则，允许回到学校六年级继续学习。
