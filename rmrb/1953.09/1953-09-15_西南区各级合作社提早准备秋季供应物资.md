Southwest Region Cooperatives at All Levels Prepare for Autumn Supply of Goods Early

    In order to ensure the smooth completion of the autumn harvest and support agricultural production, cooperatives at all levels in the Southwest Region have made early preparations for the autumn supply of materials.

    Before the autumn harvest, the preparatory committees of the provincial cooperative federations attached importance to the leadership of the autumn supply and marketing work. In July, the preparatory committee of the Sichuan Provincial Cooperative Federation issued instructions that autumn supply and marketing work must be done well, requiring "sufficient supply without delaying agricultural time."

    In summarizing the supply work in the spring and summer of this year, cooperatives in various places criticized the past neglect of investigating and studying the needs of residents, the failure to prepare in the off-season, and the rush to purchase goods in the peak season, resulting in poor quality and unsuitable specifications, as well as untimely supply and unsuitable prices. It was emphasized that the policy of "obtaining materials locally, processing locally, and supplying locally" should be implemented. Cooperatives at all levels generally started preparing for the autumn supply work as early as May and June. Measures were taken such as holding meetings of cooperative member representatives, going deep into member groups with samples of agricultural tools to solicit opinions, and holding production material exhibitions on market days to understand the needs of members and improve the specifications and quality of agricultural tools. The No. 2 District Cooperative of Bishan County, Sichuan Province, accepted the opinions put forward by the meeting of cooperative member representatives and sent cadres to Zitong Township to investigate the quantity and specifications of agricultural tools needed by farmers for the autumn harvest. After the agricultural tools were made, the opinions of the farmers were solicited again, so in July, more than 560 pieces of autumn harvest agricultural tools such as threshing tools, bamboo baskets, and sickles were supplied to the members. Cooperatives in various counties of Xikang, and Longchang, Fengjie, and Hejiang counties of Sichuan Province, implemented the method of "guaranteeing replacement, exchange, and repair" for agricultural tools that did not meet the specifications, which was welcomed by farmers, and many farmers paid in advance to order goods. Many grassroots cooperatives also organized ironworkers to go to the countryside to help farmers repair agricultural tools, saving farmers' production time.

    Cooperatives at all levels have corrected the tendency to seek far and wide for sources of goods, to face large cities, and to neglect local industrial and handicraft products. In mid-June, the Chengdu Purchasing Station of the Sichuan Provincial Cooperative Federation revised the third quarter plan, and according to the needs of cooperative members, added more than 20 kinds of local industrial and handicraft products such as Bishan floral cloth, Chengdu processed cloth, and towels. Many cooperatives have begun to attach importance to and support handicraft production. Changshou County in Sichuan Province, Guiding County in Guizhou Province, and Yiliang County in Yunnan Province, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, organized handicraftsmen to actively operate after holding a meeting of handicraft representatives to serve the autumn harvest. In Changshou County alone, the iron, bamboo, and wood agricultural tools purchased and processed by grassroots cooperatives from handicraftsmen reached more than 165,000 pieces.

    At present, some cooperatives still have the phenomenon of underestimating the needs of members and formulating plans that are too small, resulting in the shortage of agricultural tools and daily necessities in the current autumn harvest supply. Speculators are taking the opportunity to raise prices, which affects the autumn harvest. This situation has attracted attention in various places.

    西南区各级合作社提早准备秋季供应物资
    为了保证顺利完成秋收，支持农业生产，西南区各级合作社及早进行了秋季物资供应的准备工作。
    秋收前，各省合作社联合社筹备委员会都重视了秋季供销工作的领导。四川省合作社联合社筹备委员会于七月即发出了必须做好秋季供销工作的指示，要求做到“充分供应，不误农时”。
    各地合作社在总结今年春夏供应工作中，批判了过去忽视调查研究居民的需要，淡季不准备，旺季仓促进货，致使进货质量差、规格不合，同时有供应不及时、价格不合适等缺点。强调指出要贯彻“就地取材、就地加工、就地供应”的方针。各级合作社秋季供应工作一般早在五、六月份即先后进行准备。采取召开社员代表会议，带农具样品深入社员小组征求意见及逢场（赶集）日召开生产资料展览会等办法，了解社员需要，改进了农具的规格和品质。四川璧山县二区合作社接受社员代表大会提出的意见，派出干部到梓桐乡，进行对农民秋收农具数量、规格的调查。农具制就后，又征求农民的意见，因而七月份即供应社员挞斗、箩筐、镰刀等秋收农具五百六十多件。西康各县、四川隆昌、奉节、合江等县合作社，对不合规格的农具并实行“包掉、包换、包修”的办法，受到农民欢迎，不少农民都预先付钱订货。许多基层社还组织了铁工下乡，帮助农民修补农具，节省了农民生产时间。
    各级合作社纠正了组织货源问题上的舍近求远，面向大城市，忽视地方工业品与手工业品的偏向。四川省合作社联合社成都采购站在六月中旬修订第三季度计划，根据社员群众的需要，增加了璧山花布、成都加工布和毛巾等二十余种地方工业品和手工业产品。许多合作社已开始重视和支持手工业生产，四川省长寿、贵州省贵定、云南省宜良等县，在当地党委统一领导下，召开手工业代表会后，组织手工业者积极经营，为秋收服务。仅长寿县各基层社向手工业者收购和加工的铁、竹、木农具即达十六万五千余件。
    目前，有的合作社对社员需要仍有估计不足，制订计划偏小的现象，致使在当前秋收供应中发生了农具和生活用品脱销的现象，投机商人借此抬高价格，影响秋收。这种情况各地已引起重视。
