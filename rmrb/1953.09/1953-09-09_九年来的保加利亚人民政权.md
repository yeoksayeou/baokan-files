    Nine Years of the People's Government in Bulgaria
    Petkov, Bulgarian Ambassador to China
    Today, the Bulgarian people are celebrating the ninth anniversary of their great national day – Liberation Day.
    On September 9, 1944, under the leadership of the working class and its vanguard – the Communist Party, the Bulgarian people launched a nationwide armed uprising and overthrew the fascist monarchy in our country.
    The glorious and invincible Soviet army's offensive in the Balkans was of decisive significance for the victory of the September 9th Uprising. In pursuit of the defeated German fascist bandits, the Soviet army entered Bulgaria as a liberator, providing tremendous assistance and decisive influence to the victorious outcome of the uprising. As a result of the victory of the uprising, the Fatherland Front government was established, a people's democratic system was established, and a path was opened for the establishment of a socialist system in our country.
    This great event in our history is primarily due to the great Soviet Union's consistent policy against imperialism and the victory won by the brave and invincible Soviet army – the liberator. Precisely for this reason, our National Day is also a day for the Bulgarian people to express their heartfelt gratitude and thanks to their liberator, a festival for maintaining eternal friendship and cooperation with the fraternal Soviet people.
    In the past nine years of peaceful creative labor and socialist construction, the face of our country has changed. In the years since the establishment of the people's democratic government, especially in recent years, our country has transformed from an agricultural country with weak small-commodity production, backward agriculture, and underdeveloped light industry (mainly textiles) into an industrial and agricultural country. A path has been opened to rapidly overcome our country's economic backwardness, industrialize it, transform and improve agriculture, achieve comprehensive cultural prosperity, and create various conditions for the free and unlimited development of productive forces. The achievements made during this period and the wealth of experience accumulated in the planned construction of a socialist economy have opened up beautiful prospects for the happy future of our motherland and people.
    Thanks to the successful completion of the Dimitrov Five-Year National Economic Plan in four years, our socialist industry has grown rapidly. During the Five-Year Plan, more than seven hundred industrial enterprises were established and expanded. The characteristic of our industry during this period was the establishment of giant industrial enterprises that produce means of production. During the Five-Year Plan, the production of means of production increased 5.5 times compared with 1939 and 1.5 times compared with 1948. Due to the rapid development of our country's industry, we are now able to produce 130 kinds of complex machines and lathes, such as various internal combustion engines, diesel engines, air compressors, machinery for the mining industry, conveying equipment, cranes, automatic telephone exchanges, and many other machines that we had never produced before. Bulgaria is currently manufacturing all agricultural machinery except tractors and combine harvesters.
    During the Dimitrov Five-Year Plan, our power supply stations – the most important factor in national industrialization – increased significantly. The state invests large amounts of capital every year to build new power stations and expand old ones, and lay new power transmission lines. In 1952, the power generation of our country's power stations increased 4.1 times compared with the pre-war year of 1939 and 1.5 times compared with 1948.
    Great production achievements have been made in mining. In 1952, mineral extraction exceeded the 1948 level by 3.2 times, exceeding the target set by the Five-Year Plan by more than one time. This created a solid foundation for the development of non-ferrous and ferrous metallurgy industries, which in turn established a foundation for the further development of the entire national economy.
    In 1952, coal production increased by 73.7 percent compared with 1948 and 2.4 times compared with 1939. The coal extraction plan was overfulfilled by 13.1 percent. During the Five-Year Plan, coal mining has been mechanized; advanced Soviet technology has been widely adopted in Bulgarian mines. The degree of mechanization of coal mining has reached 64.5 percent, and the degree of mechanization of coal transportation has reached 91.5 percent.
    During the Dimitrov Five-Year Plan, the foundation for the industrialization of our country's economy was expanded. In 1952, the total industrial output of Bulgaria increased 1.3 times compared with 1948 and more than three times compared with 1939, with the plan being overfulfilled by 20.1 percent. The industrial Five-Year Plan was completed in three years and ten months.
    The rapid speed of industrial development has changed the contrast between industrial products and agricultural products. Although agricultural products increased in 1952, the output value of industrial products still exceeded that of agricultural products.
    The result of industrialization and agricultural development has greatly changed the source of our country's domestic raw material demand.
    Currently, our country is producing a sufficient quantity of man-made nitrogen fertilizers. Industry can fully meet the needs of the national economy for sulfuric acid. The import of steel bars, copper, cotton, wool, and other items has been reduced. All of these goods were basically imported from abroad before liberation.
    The majority of our country's middle and poor peasants have freed themselves from their primitive, backward small-scale operations and voluntarily joined agricultural production cooperatives. The number of agricultural production cooperatives reached 2,747 in 1952. They own 60.5 percent of the country's cultivated land. The main grain-producing areas have basically been cooperativized. The number of state-owned farms is also increasing. All of these have changed the face of our country's agriculture.
    The successful completion of the Five-Year Plan in agriculture has enabled our country's agriculture to better meet the growing demand of residents for agricultural products and to supply raw materials to industry in recent years.
    When pointing out the achievements of our country's agriculture, Chervenkov said: "Today, we can confidently say that in our agriculture, agricultural production cooperatives have achieved victory, and today, it is the true representative of our country's agriculture. Such a revolutionary transformation, such a victory, is equivalent to the second September 9th in our country in terms of importance."
    These achievements in agriculture would be inconceivable without the help of the great Soviet Union. At the same time, these achievements are also the result of mechanization, government assistance to agriculture through machine tractor stations, and the widespread use of higher agricultural technology.
    In 1952, the rate of machinery and equipment in our country's agriculture exceeded the task set by the Five-Year Plan. 48.6 percent of all field work is done by machines; 18.7 percent of crops are harvested by combine harvesters. The high degree of mechanization of field work has increased agricultural productivity and created conditions for the prosperity and cultural life of our country's countryside. As a result of the mechanization and adoption of advanced agricultural technology in 1952, agricultural production cooperatives harvested an average of 12.6 percent more wheat, 35.8 percent more corn, 22.1 percent more rice, and 20.7 percent more cotton per hectare than individual farmers.
    The production of technical crops has developed smoothly during the Five-Year Plan. This crop increasingly meets the raw material needs in our country's industry to a greater extent. For example, the planting area of cotton has reached 185,000 hectares, an increase of six times compared with 1939. The planting area of hemp has exceeded three times that of 1939, sugar beets – 2.5 times, tobacco – 1.5 times, and so on.
    The attitude of the masses towards labor has also changed. During the Five-Year Plan, we launched the Stakhanovite movement, and almost the entire working class was involved in socialist competition. As a result of this competition, labor productivity in 1952 exceeded the 1953 level stipulated by the Five-Year Plan by 11.6 percent. Great achievements have also been made in reducing the cost of industrial products. The national economy saved 2.81 billion leva (Bulgarian currency) in four years due to the reduction in the cost of industrial products. The number of rationalization proposers, inventors, and innovators has increased. Tens of thousands of rationalization proposals have been adopted in recent years alone.
    The achievements of various departments of the national economy have enabled our country to abolish the rationing system in 1952 and transition to the development of state-owned trade in accordance with unified retail prices. After the abolition of the rationing system, the state has implemented three price reductions on consumer goods. These are undoubtedly significant measures that have decisive significance for the development of our country's national economy and the improvement of the living standards of the working people. The implementation of these measures has increased the actual income of the working people. In 1952, the average annual salary of industrial workers increased by 38 percent compared with 1939. The income of agricultural production cooperatives has also increased. The increase in the purchasing power of the working people and the storage of goods has made it possible for the circulation of retail goods to be widely developed.
    The state's expenditures on cultural life and housing construction have increased significantly. In the four years of the Five-Year Plan, more than 3.4 million square meters of housing area were built.
    The state pays great attention to the further development and improvement of education and science. Many schools have been built; almost all school-age children have been enrolled in school. Institutions of higher learning have opened their doors to the children of workers and peasants. In 1952, the number of university students in the People's Republic of Bulgaria was two times more than in 1939, and the number of students in middle schools and secondary specialized schools was five times more than in 1939.
    The phenomenon of illiteracy in our country has been completely eliminated.
    The early completion of the Five-Year Plan is a great victory for the working people of our country. The achievements we have gained have created a solid foundation for the further development of our country's national economy. Relying on the brotherly and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and the development of our country's industry and agriculture, our country is advancing along the road indicated by Dimitrov, the mentor and leader of the Bulgarian people.
    In unbreakable unity, under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Chervenkov, under the banner of friendship with the Soviet Union, united by the firm will to build socialism in our country, the working people of our country are celebrating the ninth anniversary of the great national day of their motherland with new victories on the political and economic fronts, and with greater determination in the struggle for peace together with the great Chinese people, the people of various people's democratic countries, and all countries striving for peace under the leadership of the great Soviet Union.

    九年来的保加利亚人民政权
    保加利亚驻华大使  彼得科夫
    保加利亚人民在今天庆祝自己的伟大的国庆节——解放日的九周年。
    一九四四年九月九日，保加利亚人民在工人阶级和它的先锋队——共产党的领导下，举行了全民的武装起义，推翻了我国的法西斯君主制度。
    光荣无敌的苏军向巴尔干的进攻，对于九月九日起义的胜利，有着决定性的意义。苏军在追击败退的德国法西斯匪帮时，作为一个解放者，进入了保加利亚，对起义的胜利结局给以巨大的帮助和决定性的影响。起义胜利的结果，建立了祖国阵线政府，树立了人民民主制度，并为在我国建立社会主义制度开辟了途径。
    我国历史上的这一伟大事件，首先是由于伟大的苏联一贯执行了反对帝国主义的政策，和勇敢无敌的苏军——解放者赢得胜利的结果。正因为如此，所以我们的国庆日，同时也是保加利亚人民对他们的解放者表示衷心感激和谢意的日子，是同兄弟般的苏联人民保持永恒友谊和合作的节日。
    在进行和平的创造性劳动和社会主义建设的过去九年中，我国的面貌改观了。在人民民主政权建立后的年代中，特别是最近几年来，我国已由一个有着微弱的小商品生产和落后的农业、不很发达的轻工业，而且主要是纺织工业的农业国，变成了一个工业和农业的国家；为迅速克服我国经济落后现象、使它工业化、改造和提高农业、获得文化的全面繁荣开辟了道路，并为生产力的自由和无限制地发展创立了各种条件。在这一时期中取得的成绩和在有计划地建设社会主义经济中积累起来的大量经验，已为我们祖国和人民的幸福未来开辟了美丽的远景。
    由于在四年内顺利地完成了季米特洛夫五年国民经济计划，我国社会主义工业迅速成长起来。在五年计划的年代中，建立和扩充了七百多个工业企业。我们的工业在这个时期中的特点是，建立了生产生产资料的巨型工业企业。在五年计划中，生产资料的生产比一九三九年增加了五点五倍，比一九四八年增加了一点五倍。由于我们祖国工业的这种迅速发展，目前我们已能生产一百三十种复杂的机器和车床，如各种内燃发动机，柴油发动机，空气压缩机，采矿工业用的机械，输送装置，起重机，自动电话站和其他很多机器，这些机器我们以前都没有生产过。目前保加利亚已在制造着除拖拉机和自动联合收割机以外的所有其他农业机器。
    在季米特洛夫五年计划的年代中，我们的动力供应站——国家工业化的最重要的因素，显著地增加了。国家每年以大量资金来建筑新的和扩建旧的电力站，敷设新的电力输送线。一九五二年我国电力站的发电量比战前一九三九年增加了四点一倍，比一九四八年增加了一点五倍。
    在采矿方面获得了伟大的生产成绩。一九五二年，矿的开采量超过一九四八年的水平三点二倍，超过了五年计划规定的任务一倍多。这就为发展有色和黑色冶金工业创造了巩固的基础，而这些冶金工业又为进一步发展整个国民经济建立了基础。
    一九五二年，煤的生产比一九四八年增加了百分之七十三点七，比一九三九年增加了二点四倍。开采煤的计划超额完成了百分之十三点一。在五年计划的年代中，煤炭的开采已经机械化；在保加利亚的矿井中已经广泛地采用了先进的苏联技术。采煤工作的机械化程度达到百分之六十四点五，煤炭运送的机械化程度，达到了百分之九十一点五。
    在季米特洛夫五年计划的年代中，我国经济工业化的基础扩大了。一九五二年，保加利亚的全部工业品产量比一九四八年增加了一点三倍，比一九三九年多三倍有余，计划被超额完成百分之二十点一。工业的五年计划在三年又十个月中便完成了。
    工业发展的飞快速度改变了工业品同农产品的对比关系。一九五二年农产品虽然有增加，但工业品的产值仍超过了农产品的产值。
    工业化和农业发展的结果，使我国国内原料需求的来源方面产生了很大的变化。
    目前，我国已在生产充分数量的人造氮素肥料。工业已能充分满足国民经济中对硫酸的需要。钢筋、铜、棉花、羊毛和其他物品的入口，已经减少。所有这些货物在解放前基本上都由国外运入。
    我国的大部分中农和贫农已摆脱了他们的原始的、落后的小规模经营，自愿地参加了农业生产合作社。农业生产合作社的数量在一九五二年达到二千七百四十七个。它们拥有全国耕地面积的百分之六十点五。主要的产谷区，基本上已经合作社化了。国营农场的数字也在增加。所有这些都改变了我国农业的外貌。
    五年计划在农业方面的顺利完成，使我国农业最近得以更好地满足居民对农产品的日益增长的需求，并以原料供应工业。
    契尔文科夫在指出我国农业的成就时，说道：“今天，我们可以有信心地说，在我们的农业中，农业生产合作社已经取得了胜利，今天，它已是我国农业的真正代表。这样一个革命性的改造，这样一个胜利，从重要性上说来，就相当于我们国家的第二个九月九日。”
    农业方面的这些成就，如果没有伟大的苏联的帮助，将是不可思议的。同时，这些成就也是机械化、政府通过机器拖拉机站来帮助农业和广泛使用更高度的农业技术的结果。
    一九五二年，我国农业中的机器设备率，超过了五年计划的任务。全部田间工作的百分之四十八点六是用机器进行的；百分之十八点七的作物是用联合收割机收割的。田间工作的高度机械化提高了农业的生产率，并为我国农村的富裕和文化生活创造了条件。农业生产合作社在一九五二年实行机械化和采用先进农业技术的结果，平均每公顷土地比个体农民多收百分之十二点六的小麦，玉蜀黍多收百分之三十五点八，大米——百分之二十二点一，棉花——百分之二十点七。
    技术作物的生产在五年计划的年代中得到了顺利的发展。这种作物愈益以更大的程度满足着我国工业中的原料需求。例如，棉花的种植面积已达到十八万五千公顷，比一九三九年增加了六倍。大麻的种植面积超过一九三九年三倍，糖萝卜——二点五倍，烟草——一点五倍，以及其他等等。
    群众对劳动的态度也发生了转变。在五年计划的年代中，我们曾发起斯大哈诺夫运动，几乎全体工人阶级都投入了社会主义竞赛。进行这一竞赛的结果，使一九五二年劳动生产率超过了五年计划所规定的一九五三年水平的百分之十一点六。在降低工业品成本方面也获得巨大成就。国民经济在四年中因降低工业品成本而节约了二十八亿一千万利瓦（保币）。合理化建议者、发明者和革新者的人数增加了。仅在最近数年中就采用了成万件的合理化建议。
    国民经济各部门的成就使我国能在一九五二年废除了配给制，并过渡到依照统一零售价格来发展国营贸易。在废除配给制以后，国家曾对消费品实行了三次减价。这些无疑都是重大的措施，它们对于发展我国国民经济和改善劳动人民生活有着决定性的意义。这些措施的实行增大了劳动人民的实际收入。一九五二年，工业工人每年的平均工资比一九三九年增加了百分之三十八。农业生产合作社的收入也增加了。劳动人民购买力和商品储存的增加，使零售商品的流通获得了广泛发展的可能。
    国家用于文化生活和住屋建筑的费用，显著地增加了。在五年计划的四年中，建筑了三百四十万平方公尺以上面积的住屋。
    国家以极大的关怀注意着教育和科学事业的进一步发展和改进。建筑了很多学校；几乎所有学龄儿童都已入学。高等学校为工农子弟敞开大门。一九五二年，保加利亚人民共和国的大学生人数比一九三九年多二倍，中学和中等专科学校的学生人数比一九三九年多五倍。
    我国的文盲现象已完全消除。
    提前完成五年计划，是我国劳动人民的一个巨大胜利。我们已获得的成绩为我国国民经济的进一步发展，创立了牢固的基础。我国依靠着伟大苏联的兄弟般无私的帮助和我国工农业的发展，正在依照保加利亚人民的导师和领袖季米特洛夫所指示的道路前进。
    在牢不可破的团结中，在党和契尔文科夫同志领导下、在与苏联友好的旗帜下、为在我国建设社会主义的坚定意志所联合起来的我国劳动人民，正在用在政治和经济战线上的新胜利，用在伟大苏联领导下，同伟大的中国人民、各人民民主国家和所有争取和平的各国人民一起，更加坚决地进行争取和平的斗争，来庆祝自己祖国伟大国庆节的九周年。
