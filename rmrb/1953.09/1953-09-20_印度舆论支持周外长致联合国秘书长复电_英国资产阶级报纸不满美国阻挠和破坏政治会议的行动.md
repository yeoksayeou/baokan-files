Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 18th: The Indian newspaper "Today" published an editorial on the 15th commenting on the reply from Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, to the UN Secretary-General.

The newspaper wrote: "The conditions put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai are very clear. All countries except South Korea, the United States, and some Latin American countries under US pressure agree in principle with these proposals. The vote in the UN Political Committee on the issue of India's participation in the political conference illustrates this point." The newspaper pointed out that accepting China's suggestions "can greatly increase the likelihood of the political conference's success. As it stands, the possibility of the political conference failing is greater. The idea of the political conference taking a round-table format is also reasonable. Britain, Canada, Australia, and other countries also support this proposal."

The newspaper said: "If the United States continues to insist on its own way, how can the political conference be held? If the United States insists on its decision, will Britain, Canada, Australia, and Arab countries support it? Since Britain and other Commonwealth countries have consistently supported such principles, can they now oppose them?"

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: London dispatch: British bourgeois public opinion has widely expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' arbitrary actions in using the United Nations to obstruct and sabotage the Korean political conference.

The "Times" said in its editorial on the 15th: "The Korean dispute contains many issues that cannot be resolved solely by the belligerent parties." The paper also said: "The proper nature of the United Nations is that of a world body and a peacemaker, and it must avoid being forced to assume the role of a belligerent alliance."

The "Yorkshire Post" said in an editorial entitled "Two Tasks for the United Nations General Assembly" that the UN General Assembly should make decisions on two issues without delay. "One is the question of the status of the United Nations itself. Will it continue to be a truly worldwide organization... or will it merely become another name for an anti-communist group of allied countries led by the United States?" The other issue is the membership of the Korean political conference. In addressing this issue, the paper said that the US’s ideas now “should be replaced by more reasonable arguments” and that “Britain and the countries that agree with Britain must continue to express their views as strongly as possible.”

The "Daily Herald" commented on the proposal to invite representatives of the Chinese and North Korean governments to attend the UN General Assembly to discuss the issue of membership of the political conference, saying, "We hope that the British delegation will firmly advocate inviting China and North Korea to hear their views. What is there to object to?... If many countries adopt Murphy's policy of refusing to allow the other party to express their views, the prestige of the United Nations will suffer."

    印度舆论支持周外长致联合国秘书长复电
    英国资产阶级报纸不满美国阻挠和破坏政治会议的行动
    【新华社新德里十八日电】印度“今天报”十五日发表社论，评论我中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来致联合国秘书长的复电。
    该报写道：“周恩来总理所提出的条件是很清楚的。除了南朝鲜、美国和某些受到美国压力的拉丁美洲国家之外，一切国家都同意这些建议的原则。联合国政治委员会就印度参加政治会议问题所举行的表决就说明了这一点”。该报指出，接受中国的建议，“可以大大增加政治会议成功的可能性。照现在的情况，政治会议失败的可能性是比较大的。政治会议采取圆桌会议形式的意见也是合理的。英国、加拿大、澳大利亚和其他国家也赞成这个主张”。
    该报说：“如果美国仍然坚持己见，政治会议怎么能举行呢？如果美国坚持它的决定，英国、加拿大、澳大利亚和阿拉伯国家会赞成它吗？既然英国和其他联邦国家一直赞成这样的一些原则，现在它们能够反对这些原则吗？”
    【新华社十八日讯】伦敦消息：英国资产阶级舆论对于美国利用联合国来阻挠与破坏朝鲜政治会议的专横行动，纷纷表示不满。
    “泰晤士报”在十五日的社论中说：“朝鲜争端包含着许多问题，是不可能单单由交战国双方加以解决的。”该报又说：“联合国的正当性质是一种世界性质和缔造和平的性质，它必须尽量避免被迫担任一种交战国联盟的角色。”
    “约克郡邮报”在题为“联合国大会的两项任务”的社论中说，联合国大会目前应该毫不延迟地对两个问题作出决定。“一个是关于联合国本身的地位问题。它还是继续成为真正的全世界性的组织……还是仅仅成为以美国为首的盟国反共集团的另一个名称呢？”另一个问题是朝鲜政治会议的成员问题。在谈到这个问题时，该报说，美国的观念现在“该用较为合理的论据来代替了”，“英国和赞成英国意见的国家必须继续尽可能强烈地表达它们的意见”。
    “每日先驱报”评论邀请中朝政府代表出席联合国大会讨论政治会议成员问题的建议说，“我们希望英国代表团坚决主张邀请中国和北朝鲜，听取它们的意见。这有什么可反对的呢？……如果许多国家都采取墨菲的拒绝让他方发表意见的政策，联合国的威望将会遭受损失。”
