    Shanxi and other places should educate farmers to change the habit of mixing wheat seeds with vegetable oil

    Yu Zhiping from the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture writes: Some farmers in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and parts of the northeastern provinces have the habit of mixing wheat seeds with vegetable oil when sowing. They believe that mixing seeds with vegetable oil can replace fertilizer and prevent smut disease. However, according to several years of experiments by the Shanxi Provincial Farm and the Changzhi Special District Farm, mixing seeds with vegetable oil not only does not increase production but also reduces wheat yield; it not only does not prevent wheat smut disease but also increases the incidence rate. Preliminary analysis shows that mixing wheat seeds with vegetable oil has the following disadvantages:

    (1) Vegetable oil coating the seed epidermis hinders the seed's absorption of moisture and air from the soil, causing some seeds to germinate slowly and some to rot.

    (2) The main components of vegetable oils are carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and do not contain the substances needed by crops - nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Therefore, it has no effect on promoting crop growth and development; on the contrary, the free fatty acids produced by its decomposition by microorganisms are harmful to wheat seedlings, so the more vegetable oil used during seed mixing, the more severe the seedling shortage.

    (3) The castor and sesame oils commonly used by farmers have no bactericidal power and cannot prevent diseases at all; and the seeds mixed with oil germinate slowly, and the seedlings are tender and weak, which increases the chance of being invaded by pathogens and the infection rate of smut disease.

    Therefore, I suggest that agricultural administrative departments and agricultural technicians in areas where there is a habit of mixing seeds with oil should educate farmers to change the habit of mixing wheat seeds with vegetable oil.

    Editor's note: The Grain Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture believes that Comrade Yu Zhiping's opinion is correct. Although the area where there is a habit of mixing wheat seeds with vegetable oil is not widespread, this practice wastes financial resources and affects the harvest, which is very detrimental to farmers. The local agricultural technology guidance departments should pay attention to this issue and actively use practical experiments to persuade farmers to change this habit.

### 山西等地应该教育农民改变用植物油拌麦种的习惯

专栏：读者来信摘要

    山西等地应该教育农民改变用植物油拌麦种的习惯
    山西省人民政府农业厅于志平来信：山西、陕西、山东、河南、河北以及东北各省部分地区的少数农民，在播种小麦时有用植物油拌种的习惯。他们认为，用植物油拌种可顶肥料，防治黑穗病。但据山西省农场、长治专区农场几年来的试验结果，植物油拌种不但不能增加生产，反而会使小麦减产；不但不能防治小麦黑穗病，反而会使发病率增高。经初步分析，用植物油拌种播种小麦有以下几个害处：
    （一）植物油拌种使种籽表皮涂抹油脂，阻碍了种籽吸收土壤中的水分和空气，使一部分种籽发芽迟缓，一部分种籽腐烂。
    （二）植物油类主要成分是由碳、氢、氧三元素组成，并不含有作物所需要的物质——氮、磷、钾，因此对作物毫无促进生长发育的效力；相反地，其被微生物分解所产生的游离脂肪酸有害于小麦幼芽幼根，因此拌种时使用植物油愈多则缺苗也愈严重。
    （三）农民所习惯用的蓖麻、胡麻等油类并无杀菌力，根本不能防治病害；而经过油类拌种的种籽发芽迟、幼芽嫩弱，反而增加了被病菌侵害的机会和黑穗病感染率。
    因此，我建议有用油类拌种习惯地区的农业行政部门及农业技术工作者，应该教育农民改变用植物油拌种的习惯。
    编者按：中央农业部粮食司认为于志平同
    志的意见是对的。目前有用植物油拌种小麦习
    惯的地区虽然不广，但这种做法既浪费财力，
    又影响收获，对农民是很不利的。当地农业技
    术指导部门应该注意这个问题，并积极用进行
    实际试验的做法来说服农民改变这种习惯。
