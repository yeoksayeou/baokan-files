    A Visit to the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant
    Member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Delegation to the Soviet Union, Zhao Su
    On a clear day, we visited the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant in Sverdlovsk.
    The Ural Heavy Machinery Plant began construction in 1928 and started production in 1933. The purpose of the Soviet Communist Party and the government in establishing this factory was to supply various machinery and equipment needed for the national economy. With the increasing development of the Soviet national economy, the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant has also rapidly expanded and developed. Now its scale is so grand that it can produce iron-making machines, blast furnaces, turbines, machine tools, lathes, excavators, and various mining equipment. This factory can complete the entire production process from sand casting, iron smelting, manufacturing heavy parts to assembly.
    Our tour began with the sand casting workshop, where we saw workers (both male and female) making various sand molds. They all used electrical machinery to operate. Previously, when people worked with their hands, it took eight or nine hours to make a sand mold. Now, with electrical machinery, they can make eight or nine sand molds in just one hour. Moreover, they are now manufacturing various sand molds weighing from one ton to seventy tons. In the forging workshop, there was a steam hammer weighing 250 tons, with a pressure of 10,000 tons, capable of hammering steel blocks weighing 150 tons. In the excavator parts processing workshop, there was a finished large bucket for a heavy-duty excavator. More than twenty of us walked into the bucket, and it still seemed very spacious. This huge bucket will be installed on the world's newest and largest automatic walking excavator. This new excavator weighs 1,400 tons, and its long-arm lever is 65 meters long. The bucket capacity is 20 cubic meters, capable of digging 38 to 40 tons of soil at a time. Such a large machine is very agile in operation, and each operation takes less than a minute. According to people in the factory, not long ago, the Sverdlovsk Conservatory of Music's symphony orchestra came to perform for the workers in the factory, but they couldn't find a spacious place in the workshop to use as a stage. As a result, they chose the bottom plate of this large excavator. A sixty-member orchestra, with their instruments, played on it.
    In many workshops of the factory, all kinds of complex machines are installed in an orderly manner. They are all automated or semi-automated, so only a few workers can produce various machines and lathes. And these machines and lathes can be used to build many new factories and produce many new machines. Therefore, the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant is aptly called the "factory of factories."
    The employees of the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant have contributed their greatest strength and wisdom, and have brought into play a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creative spirit in completing the tasks given by the state and in the struggle to expand the factory and improve product quality. Ninety-eight percent of the workers in this factory are Stakhanovite workers, and forty-two people have won the Stalin Prize for their outstanding labor achievements and contributions, including the factory director, workers, engineers, and staff. We have not only seen the photos of these model workers on the factory's honor roll, but also personally met some of them.
    The employees of the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant are not satisfied with their existing achievements, and therefore are constantly strengthening their political and technical studies. More than 800 people are participating in technical night schools, night colleges, and Marxist-Leninist night universities, and some employees are participating in specialized schools without leaving production. And those employees who do not attend night school study political and technical courses every Monday and Thursday. What to learn? How to learn? Each worker can choose voluntarily. Due to such extensive and frequent learning, the political and technical level of the workers is constantly and rapidly improving. For example, when the factory began manufacturing the first batch of less efficient self-propelled excavators, it took almost two hundred people two months to complete the assembly; but now, it only takes sixty people twenty days to complete a more complex assembly. This summer, all personnel are working hard to improve technology and tap production potential in order to produce more, newer, better, and cheaper products for the country, and strive to complete the five-year plan quota ahead of schedule.
    July 15th of this year was the 20th anniversary of the opening of the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant. All the employees of the factory presented a heavy-duty excavator with a digging capacity of 20 cubic meters, which they designed and manufactured, as a precious gift. This shows that the workers of the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant have made a major new contribution to the Soviet Union's communist construction project.
    The Ural Heavy Machinery Plant not only created all the complete conditions needed for the employees to work, but also established various facilities to meet their material and cultural needs as much as possible. The factory has parks, cultural palaces, stadiums, and libraries, nurseries and schools, department stores and canteens, cinemas and theaters, as well as trams and cars running on clean streets. The employees live a happy and fulfilling life here. They widely participate in various cultural, artistic and sports activities in their spare time. The factory's cultural palace has a total of twenty-one entertainment groups and twenty-three different sports activities.
    The children of the employees receive meticulous care and attention in the nurseries. We visited a nursery that could accommodate one hundred children. Because it was summer, many children had gone home, and some had gone to villas to escape the heat, and would not return for more than a month. According to comrades in the nursery, the cost per child per month is 330 rubles, but his parents only need to bear up to 30% - generally 20% to 25%, and the rest is paid by the state. Due to the increasing scale of the factory, in addition to the original seventeen nurseries, ten more will be built.
    The employees of the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant, like the people of Sverdlovsk, often go to the extremely beautiful lakeside and mountain areas outside the city for rest on holidays. On the shores of Shartash Lake and Beskatda Lake in the Ural region, tourists' cars are often parked in rows. This year, the factory also specially built a swimming pool for the employees on nearby Balde Lake.
    The Ural Heavy Machinery Plant is located in a beautifully landscaped green area. It is not only a place for people to work selflessly, but also a paradise for a happy life. Like other places we visited in the Soviet Union, it showed us the beautiful reality and even more brilliant prospects of socialist countries. This is a great encouragement to us, and makes us work harder and more conscientiously to learn from the Soviet Union, and strive for the industrialization of the motherland and the gradual transition to a socialist society!

    乌拉尔重型机器制造厂访问记
    中苏友协总会赴苏参观团团员    赵粟
    在一个天气晴朗的日子里，我们访问了斯维尔德洛夫斯克的乌拉尔重型机器制造厂。
    乌拉尔重型机器制造厂于一九二八年开始修建，一九三三年开始生产。苏联共产党和政府建立这个厂的目的，是为了供应国民经济所需的各种机器设备。随着苏联国民经济的日益发展，乌拉尔重型机器制造厂也迅速地扩大和发展起来。现在它的规模已是那样宏大，能够生产冶铁机、高炉、透平机、工作母机、车床、掘土机以及矿业方面的各种设备。这个工厂可以完成从翻砂、冶铁、制造重型零件直到装配的全部生产过程。
    我们参观的程序是首先到翻砂车间，在那里看到了工人们（有男工也有女工）正在制作各种砂型。他们都用电气机械来操作。从前人们用两只手工作时，八、九小时内才能制出一个砂型，现在有了电气机械，只需一小时就可以造出八、九个砂型来了，而且现在制造的有从一吨到七十吨重的各种砂型。在锻冶车间里，有一个自身重二百五十吨的汽锤，其压力达一万吨，可锤一百五十吨重的钢铁块。在掘土机零件加工车间里，放着一个制造好了的重型掘土机的大掘斗。我们二十几个人都走到掘斗里去，掘斗还显得很宽敞。这个巨大的掘斗将安装在世界上最新也是最大的自动步行掘土机上。这部新掘土机重达一千四百吨，它那长臂式的杠杆有六十五公尺长，掘斗容量为二十立方公尺，一次能挖土三十八到四十吨。这样庞大的机器，动作起来却非常灵巧，人们每操作一次只需不到一分钟的时间。据厂里的人说，不久以前，斯维尔德洛夫斯克音乐馆的交响乐队来向厂里的工人演出，但在车间里找不到一个宽敞地方作演奏台，结果他们选中了这个大掘土机的底板。六十个人的乐队带上乐器就在这上面演奏起来。
    在工厂的许多车间里，井井有条地安装着各种各样的复杂机器。它们都是自动化或半自动化了的，因此只要少数工人就可以生产出各种不同的机器和车床来。而这些机器和车床，又可以用来建立许多新的工厂，出产许多新的机器。因此，乌拉尔重型机器制造厂就十分恰当地被人们称为“工厂的工厂”。
    乌拉尔重型机器制造厂的职工们在完成国家所给予的任务和为扩大工厂、提高产品质量的斗争中，贡献出了自己最大的力量和智慧，发挥了高度的劳动积极性和创造精神。这个工厂有百分之九十八的工人都是斯大哈诺夫式工作者，有四十二个人因卓越的劳绩与贡献而荣获了斯大林奖金，其中包括厂长、工人、工程师和职员。我们不但在工厂的光荣榜上看到过这些模范们的照片，而且也亲自会见了他们中间的一些人。
    乌拉尔重型机器制造厂的职工们并不满足于自己已有的成就，因而总是在不断地加强政治和技术的学习。他们参加技术夜校、夜学院和马克思列宁主义夜大学学习的就有八百多人，还有的职工在不脱离生产的情况之下参加了专科学校的学习。而没有进夜校的职工们则在每星期一、四学习政治和技术课程。要学什么？怎样学法？每个工人都可以自愿选择。由于这样广泛的和经常的学习，工人们的政治、技术水平总是不断地在迅速提高着。例如，当工厂着手制造第一批生产效率较低的自行挖掘机时，几乎要二百人用两月时间才能装配完成；可是现在只要六十个人用二十天的功夫就能完成更加复杂的装配工作。今年夏天，全体人员都在努力提高技术和发掘生产潜力，以便给国家生产更多、更新、更好、更便宜的产品，并争取提前完成五年计划的定额。
    今年七月十五日是乌拉尔重型机器厂开工二十周年纪念日。全厂职工们把他们所设计和制造的掘土量达二十立方公尺的重型掘土机，作为珍贵的献礼。这说明，乌拉尔重型机器制造厂的工人们，对苏联的共产主义建设工程作出了重大的新的贡献。
    乌拉尔重型机器制造厂不仅为职工们创设了为工作所需的一切完备条件，而且为了尽量满足他们的物质与文化生活需要而建立了各种设施。全厂有公园、文化宫、体育场和图书馆，有托儿所和学校，有百货商店和食堂，有电影院和戏院，还有在清洁的街道上行驶着的电车和汽车。职工们就在这里过着愉快幸福的生活。他们在业余时间广泛地参加各种文化艺术和体育活动。该厂的文化宫共有二十一个文娱小组和二十三种不同的体育活动。
    职工们的子女在托儿所里受到无微不至的关怀与照顾。我们曾参观了一个可容一百名儿童的托儿所。因为是在夏天，许多孩子回家去了，有的则到别墅去避暑，要一个多月再回来。据托儿所里的同志说，每个孩子每月的费用为三百三十个卢布，但他的家长最多只需负担百分之三十——一般的是百分之二十到二十五，其余都由国家支付。由于工厂规模日益扩大，现在除了原有的十七个托儿所外，将再建立十所。
    乌拉尔重型机器制造厂的职工们和斯维尔德洛夫斯克人一样，常常在假日里到城外湖光山色极为美丽的地方去休息。在乌拉尔区的沙尔塔什湖、别斯卡答湖的湖滨上，常常成排地停放着游客们的小汽车。今年，这个工厂还特地在附近的巴尔得湖上为职工们修建了一个游泳场。
    乌拉尔重型机器制造厂处在一个风景优美的绿化地区。这里不仅是人们忘我劳动的场所，同时也是幸福生活的乐园。和我们在苏联参观的其他地方
    一样，它向我们展现了社会主义国家的美好的现实与更加灿烂的远景。这对我们是一种莫大的鼓舞，使我们更加努力、认真地向苏联学习，为祖国的工业化与逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗！
