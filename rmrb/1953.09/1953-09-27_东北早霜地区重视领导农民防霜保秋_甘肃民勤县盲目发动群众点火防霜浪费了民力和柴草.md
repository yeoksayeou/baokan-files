    Early frost has fallen in parts of northeastern and eastern Northeast China since early September. Leading organs in these areas have paid attention to this situation and actively led the masses to light fires and create smoke to prevent frost damage. Most counties and banners in Heilongjiang Province attach great importance to frost prevention work. The Nehe County Party Committee, according to instructions from the Provincial Party Committee, issued emergency instructions and organized cadres to go to the countryside to mobilize the masses for frost prevention. Frost prevention command centers were established in key areas, with dedicated personnel monitoring thermometers at night, organizing experienced farmers to accurately assess frost signs, and directing farmers to light fires and create smoke. Qinggang County organized hundreds of county and district cadres in late last month to go deep into villages and settlements to mobilize the masses to carry out frost prevention and autumn protection. Now, frost prevention organizations have been established in various districts and villages, regarding frost and cold prevention as one of the most important tasks for protecting autumn crops and striving to increase yields. Lalin, Bayan, Shuangcheng, Yilan, and other counties in Songjiang Province have also mobilized the masses to create smoke for frost prevention based on their specific local conditions. Shuangcheng County has achieved significant results in frost prevention work due to prior explanations to the masses about the scientific principles of frost prevention, as well as good material and organizational preparations. Leading cadres from Xifeng and Xi'an in Liaodong Province, Shuangliao in Liaoxi Province, and Shulan in Jilin Province have led work groups to go deep into districts and villages to lead the masses in frost prevention. Cadres from the Third District of Shuangliao County consulted with villagers and the masses in advance to study past frost conditions and prevention methods. Everyone agreed to use smoke to prevent frost in low-lying areas and in soybean and sorghum fields. In mid-September, more than 1,700 people participated in frost prevention work, protecting 1,700 hectares of crops from frost damage.
    However, some cadres and farmers lack sufficient understanding of frost prevention work. Some are complacent, believing that frost will not necessarily come soon. Others are pessimistic, believing that frost is an irresistible disaster. Among the farmers, there are also ideas of fearing trouble, disliking hard work, and being reluctant to use firewood for smoke. Various localities are now criticizing and educating against these ideas to further strengthen frost prevention work, while also using various methods to promote early maturity of crops to avoid frost damage.
    Furthermore, it is reported that leading cadres in Minqin County, Gansu Province, blindly mobilized the masses to light fires for frost prevention, wasting manpower and firewood. After receiving a telephone instruction from the Wuwei Prefectural Commissioner's Office on September 10th regarding frost prevention, various agencies immediately dispatched cadres to the countryside to lead farmers in frost prevention, and mobilized teachers and students from schools to go to the suburbs during their spare time to conduct publicity and mobilization. Broadcast loudspeakers and reading groups also introduced experience to the masses in the evening. However, they did not carefully investigate the specific situation of local climate changes, nor did they consult with experienced old farmers about frost prevention. They then mobilized farmers to light fires. Many areas in the Second District started fires in the fields that night, and thick smoke still shrouded the fields until the next morning, but there was no frost, thus wasting a lot of manpower and firewood.

    东北早霜地区重视领导农民防霜保秋
    甘肃民勤县盲目发动群众点火防霜浪费了民力和柴草
    东北北部和东部部分地区，自九月初旬以来，已先后降落早霜，各该地领导机关已注意这一情况，积极领导群众拢火熏烟，防止霜害。黑龙江省大部县、旗对防霜工作都很重视，讷河县委根据省委指示，除发出紧急指示外，并组织干部下乡发动群众防霜。在重点区设立防霜指挥部，有专人在夜间掌握寒暑表，组织有经验的农民，看准降霜征兆，指挥农民点火熏烟。青岗于上月下旬即组织县区干部数百名，深入村屯发动群众展开防霜保秋工作，现各区村都已设立防霜组织，把防霜防冻作为当前保护秋禾争取增加收获量的重要工作之一。松江省拉林、巴彦、双城、依兰等县也都根据当地具体情况，发动群众熏烟防霜。双城县由于事先向群众讲清防霜的科学道理，做好物资准备和组织准备，防霜工作已收到很大效果。辽东省的西丰、西安，辽西省的双辽和吉林省的舒兰等县的领导干部，都分别率领工作组深入区村，领导群众防霜。双辽三区干部，事先到村屯和群众研究过去降霜情况和预防办法，大家同意在洼地及大豆、高粱地用熏烟法防霜，在九月中旬便有一千七百余人参加防霜工作，使一千七百垧庄稼免受霜害。
    但也有部分干部和农民对防霜工作认识不足，有的麻痹大意，认为霜不一定马上就来，有的消极悲观，认为霜是无法抗拒的灾害。在农民中还存在怕麻烦、嫌费工、舍不得柴火熏烟等思想。各地现正一面对这些思想进行批判与教育，进一步加强防霜工作；一面利用各种方法，促进庄稼早熟，免受霜害。
    又讯：甘肃省民勤县领导干部盲目发动群众点火防霜，浪费了民力和柴草。民勤县在九月十日接到武威专署防霜的电话指示以后，各机关立即抽调干部下乡领导农民防霜，并发动学校的教师和学生利用课余时间到城郊去宣传动员，各处广播筒、读报组在晚上也向群众介绍经验。但是，他们没有很好地考查当地气候变化的具体情况，也没有向防霜有经验的老农商讨，便发动农民点火，二区不少地区当晚就在地里烧起火来，直到第二天早晨，浓烟还笼罩着田间，但并未落霜，因此，浪费了很多的民力和柴草。
