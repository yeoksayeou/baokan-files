    The Soviet Union Actively Develops the Textile Industry and Increases Textile Production
    Will Fulfill the Five-Year Plan's Production Targets for Woolen and Silk Fabrics Ahead of Schedule
   [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th] Moscow News: In order to further improve the material well-being of the people, the Soviet government is actively developing the textile industry and increasing the production of textiles. The Soviet Union's output of cotton fabrics this year will be 34 percent higher than in 1940; woolen fabrics will increase by 75.8 percent compared to 1940; and silk fabrics will almost increase sixfold compared to 1940. The production targets for woolen and silk fabrics set in the Fifth Five-Year Plan will be completed one or two years ahead of schedule. Currently, the Soviet Union is expanding and renovating existing textile industrial enterprises. In the next three years, the Soviet Union will expand and renovate a total of 35 woolen mills and 11 silk mills. After expansion and renovation, these factories will greatly increase the production capacity of the Soviet textile industry; woolen industrial enterprises alone can produce an additional 44 million meters of woolen fabrics in the next two years. In addition, the Soviet Union is currently building new textile factories in cities such as Minsk, Ivanovo, Kalinin, Darnitsa, and Krasnoyarsk, some of which will begin production before the end of 1954. These factories under construction are very large in scale. For example, a silk factory currently under construction in Krasnoyarsk can produce 46.5 million meters of various silk fabrics annually.
    Textile workers across the Soviet Union, responding to the call of the Communist Party and the government, have launched socialist production competitions, striving to tap production potential to increase production, reduce costs, and improve product quality. Workers, engineers, and technicians of textile industrial enterprises in Moscow and the Moscow region have recently decided to increase production this year by 3.3 million meters of woolen fabrics, 3.5 million meters of silk fabrics, 10 million meters of cotton fabrics, and a large quantity of knitwear. Workers at the Naro-Fominsk Textile Factory in the Moscow region have recently been overfulfilling their production plans by 3,000 to 4,000 meters of cloth per day. They guarantee to double their output in 1954 compared to 1950 and increase the variety of silk and satin production. After recalculating their potential, the staff of the Shebakov Woolen Combine Factory in Moscow decided to increase production by 133,000 meters of high-quality fine woolen fabrics above the plan this year and reduce costs by 1.208 million rubles. The Tbilisi Woolen Mill has guaranteed to complete its production plan ahead of schedule, produce 100,000 meters of woolen fabrics above the plan by the end of this year, and save 24 tons of wool and 19,000 meters of fabrics. Workers at the Minsk Fine Wool Combine Factory have also launched a competition to increase production. During the competition, fine yarn worker Saulova completed 116 to 133 percent of her production tasks on August 11th and 12th.

    苏联积极发展纺织工业增加纺织品产量
    将提前完成五年计划规定的毛织品和丝织品的生产任务
   【新华社十四日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联政府为了进一步增进人民的物质福利，正在积极发展纺织工业，增加纺织品的产量。苏联今年棉织品的产量将比一九四○年多百分之三十四；毛织品将比一九四○年增加百分之七十五点八；丝织品差不多将增加为一九四○年的六倍。第五个五年计划为毛织品和丝织品规定的生产任务，将提前一年或两年完成。现在，苏联正在扩大和改建现有的纺织工业企业。在今后三年中，苏联总共将扩大和改建三十五个毛织工厂和十一个丝织工厂。这些工厂经过扩大和改建后，将使苏联纺织工业的生产能力大大提高；单是毛织品工业企业就可以在今后两年内多生产四千四百万公尺的毛织品。此外，苏联现在还正在明斯克、伊凡诺佛、加里宁、达尔尼查和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克等城市建造新的纺织工厂，其中有些工厂将在一九五四年年底以前开工生产。这些正在建筑的工厂的规模很大，例如目前正在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克建筑的一个丝织厂，每年就可以生产四千六百五十万公尺的各种丝织品。
    苏联各地的纺织工人响应共产党和政府的号召，纷纷展开社会主义生产竞赛，努力发掘生产潜力来增加生产、降低成本和改进产品质量。莫斯科市和莫斯科州纺织工业企业的工人、工程师和技术人员，最近已决定要在今年增产三百三十万公尺的毛织品、三百五十万公尺的丝织品、一千万公尺的棉织品和大量的针织物。莫斯科州的纳罗—福明纺织厂的工人们，近来每天都超计划生产三、四千公尺的布匹。他们保证在一九五四年把产量增加到一九五○年的两倍，并增加生产丝、绸的种类。莫斯科的谢巴科夫毛织联合工厂的工作人员在重新计算了自己的潜力之后，决定要在今年超计划增产十三万三千公尺质量很高的细毛织品，并减低成本一百二十万八千卢布。第比利斯呢绒工厂已保证要提前完成生产计划，在今年年底超计划生产十万公尺毛织品，并节省二十四吨羊毛和一万九千公尺的织物。明斯克细呢联合工厂的工人们也展开了增加产量的竞赛。在竞赛期间，细纱工沙乌洛娃曾在八月十一、十二日两日完成了生产任务百分之一百一十六至一百三十三。
