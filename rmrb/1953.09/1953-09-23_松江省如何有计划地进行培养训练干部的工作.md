    How Songjiang Province Systematically Carries Out the Work of Training Cadres
    Li Xingchun
    The nation's planned economic construction requires a large number of talents. To meet this requirement, the Organization Department of the CCP Songjiang Provincial Committee and the Personnel Department of the Provincial People's Government formulated a plan for training cadres in 1953. The implementation of this plan has promoted various tasks, and the cadre work in Songjiang Province has gradually become proactive. According to statistics at the end of June, the province had organized more than 22,700 cadres for various training programs, of which more than 13,600 had already completed their training. The political awareness and professional capabilities of the cadres after training have generally improved significantly. Cadres who were previously unwilling to work in basic construction departments or cooperatives are now dedicated to their work. The improvement in the professional abilities of ordinary cadres after training is also very significant. For example, some newly promoted construction workers in basic construction units have become familiar with construction drawings and operating procedures after studying. The increase in the number and quality of cadres has significantly increased the strength to complete current tasks. After a large number of cadres were trained, the vacancies in many units were filled, the institutions were strengthened, the newly established institutions were equipped with cadres in a timely manner, and the task of transferring cadres to the state was overfulfilled. In the past six months, the province has added more than 5,000 cadres, and the phenomenon of work being affected or overtime due to insufficient personnel has changed. The hundreds of cadres needed for the many new institutions added in the province in the first half of the year have also been trained and promoted, so that new work can be launched in a timely manner. Among the more than 1,000 newly promoted cadres, 51 percent have been trained, and 40 percent have been trained through reserve lists or apprenticeship methods, so they can generally adapt to the requirements of the work. In the first half of this year, the province also transferred 1,646 cadres to the state, overfulfilling the task of transferring cadres to other provinces. Units that have done a better job, such as the Songjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, have achieved a situation in cadre work where there are no vacancies, the quality is guaranteed to a certain extent, they do not complain about difficulties when transferring cadres to higher levels, and they do not ask for people when increasing institutions.
    Songjiang Province's cadre training work is carried out in a planned manner. After the country entered the construction period, the demand for cadres became extremely urgent. If not trained in a planned manner, it would be difficult to meet the requirements of the development of the construction cause in terms of quality and quantity. As a result, not only would cadre work be passive, but also the national construction would be affected due to a lack of talent. This year, Songjiang Province not only has a provincial plan for training cadres, but also most units have specific plans on how to implement it. Units with specific implementation plans are able to arrange the annual tasks by quarter, so that they can carry out the cadre training work in an orderly manner according to the plan, which not only avoids confusion and passivity, and the phenomenon of being tight first and then loose, but also makes the cadre training work easy to check and not be squeezed out by other work. This is the case with the Department of Agriculture. The Department of Agriculture not only has agricultural technical schools and tractor schools to train agricultural technical cadres for future agricultural construction in a planned way, but also can meet the current needs in a planned way. This year, the department needs to establish 180 agricultural technology promotion stations, so they planned to open eight training courses to train 1,108 cadres. The department also regularly goes deep into various schools and training courses to check work, solve problems, and overcome various difficulties in the training work. Conversely, some units, because they do not have a plan for training cadres, either have vacancies or the quality does not meet the requirements.
    The implementation of the cadre training plan was not very serious at the beginning, and the Songjiang Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Government have been constantly fighting against these erroneous attitudes. For example, when the plan was first implemented, the Education Department put the formulated plan in the drawer and neither implemented it nor studied it. When the Personnel Section of the Industry Department asked the leading cadres to implement the plan, the reply was: "Production is very busy, let's put the plan for training cadres aside for a while." The department even transferred the only cadre who was doing training work to other work. The leading cadres of the Songjiang Provincial People's Court regarded the training of cadres as the sole responsibility of the Party's Organization Department and the government's personnel department, and did not care about it. After discovering these problems, the Organization Department of the Songjiang Provincial Party Committee and the Personnel Department of the Provincial People's Government immediately concentrated their efforts to study and solve them. After research, it was found that the reason why many leading cadres adopted an irresponsible and passive attitude towards this work was mainly because they did not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of training cadres during the period of national planned economic construction. According to this situation, the problem was first solved from the ideological perspective of the cadres. The Deputy Secretary of the Songjiang Provincial Party Committee and the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government personally explained the importance of training cadres for national construction at the meetings of responsible cadres of various agencies and units; at the same time, they organized responsible cadres of various agencies and units and comrades doing cadre work to study various relevant documents, and invited units that had done a good job in cadre work to introduce their experiences. After everyone's ideological understanding was clear, the Organization Department and the Personnel Department organized key inspections, held meetings, and carried out criticism and self-criticism. In this way, the cadre training work was fully launched.
    After the work was launched, new ideological obstacles occurred. The responsible cadres of the Jiamusi City Cooperative Union said: "Our cadres have low education and shallow qualifications, and it is too late to train them now!" "Economic work is not simple, what problems can be solved by training for a few days!" Some basic construction units are still afraid that the training work will affect production, and want to wait until the winter when construction is not possible before training cadres. Some units do not send students according to the conditions. A storage and transportation company sent bookkeepers and over-measurement personnel to the cadre school to replace section-level backbones to study. Some units even sent embezzlers and cadres who had made mistakes to study. Some departments felt that the quality of their cadres was still acceptable, and were afraid that the organizational departments would find out after training and let them transfer to other places, so they did not open training classes. The Organization Department of the Songjiang Provincial Party Committee and the Personnel Department of the Provincial People's Government criticized the erroneous ideas such as departmentalism by holding symposiums and issuing circulars, and instructed all localities to ensure that students are sent according to the prescribed conditions. At the same time, they went deep into the No. 103 construction site to create experience in training cadres during construction, and used this fact to educate and promote those units that believed that cadres could not be trained during construction. After repeated education and urging, most responsible cadres have realized the significance of training a large number of cadres, and regard the training of cadres as the "basic construction work" in cadre work. The Songjiang Provincial Department of Commerce, Acheng County Party Committee, and Shuangcheng County Party Committee have all included this work in the departmental work plan. Leading cadres also regard it as one of the important leadership work, often discussing and discussing it at meetings, and conducting inspections and summaries. The cadre training work can therefore be carried out relatively smoothly.
    Due to the attention of leading cadres at all levels, in the past six months, various units have not only expanded the cadre training institutions, equipped them with more than 250 cadres, but also created a variety of ways to train cadres. In addition to using the method of regular schools to train cadres, Songjiang Province also runs temporary professional training courses according to the needs of various fields. At present, professional training courses in basic construction, industry, agriculture, health, grain, forestry, cooperation, and justice have been opened. In order to solve the problem of technical guidance in spring plowing and summer hoeing, special agricultural technical training courses have also been opened. As long as these training courses are closely combined with the central work, and the teaching aspect adheres to the principle of less but refined, they can both improve the quality of cadres and solve the key problems in the current work. Many effective methods have also been adopted for the training of on-the-job cadres. Opening spare-time schools and conducting regular business education is one of the methods to improve on-the-job cadres. The existing schools and training courses in Songjiang Province can only complete 30 percent of the training tasks of on-the-job cadres, and the work requires cadres to improve universally. Opening spare-time schools is an effective way to solve this problem. Songjiang Province and Harbin City have now jointly established a spare-time industrial university, and the Provincial Design Company has opened a spare-time technical school and cadre work lectures. These schools can systematically improve the professional level of cadres. With the development of the work, it is necessary to constantly promote cadres. Formulating a cadre reserve list is a planned and targeted method of training and promoting cadres; the method of formulating a cadre reserve list is: each department ranks the cadres according to its own situation, and the leadership studies and determines which cadres can be promoted to section chiefs and which people can be promoted to section chiefs. After the list is determined, a special person is designated to be responsible for training and education, so that they have considerable leadership ability within a certain period of time. In this way, when the work develops or it is necessary to transfer cadres to higher levels, the work of the unit will not be affected. In addition, many units have also adopted methods such as organizing business research meetings, thematic discussions, technical or advanced experience lectures, apprenticeship, or through arranging, summarizing, and checking work to consciously improve the professional level of cadres. As long as these methods do not become formalistic, they are all conducive to the growth of cadres.

    松江省如何有计划地进行培养训练干部的工作
    李兴春
    国家有计划的经济建设需要大批人材。为了满足这个要求，中共松江省委组织部和省人民政府人事厅制订了一九五三年培养训练干部计划。这个计划执行的结果，对各项工作都起了推动作用，松江省的干部工作也逐渐转为主动。据六月底的统计，全省已组织二万二千七百多名干部进行各种训练，其中有一万三千六百多名已经训练完毕。经过培养训练的干部，一般的政治觉悟和业务能力都有显著提高。过去不愿在基本建设部门工作或不愿在合作社工作的干部，现在都安心于自己的工作。经过训练后一般干部业务能力的提高也非常显著。例如有些基本建设单位新提拔的施工员，经过学习已经熟悉了施工图纸和操作规程。干部数量的增加和质量的提高，显著地增加了完成当前各项工作任务的力量。大量地培养和训练干部以后，许多单位的缺额补上了，机构充实了，新建的机构及时地配备了干部，并且超额完成了向国家输送干部的任务。半年来，全省共补充了五千多名干部，因为人员不足而影响工作或者加班加点的现象已经改变。全省半年来新增加的许多机构所需要的数百名干部，也已经训练和提拔上来，使新的工作能够及时展开。新提拔的一千多名干部中，有百分之五十一经过了训练，有百分之四十是采用后备名单或带徒弟等办法培养出来的，因之能够大体上适应工作的要求。全省在今年上半年还向国家输送干部一千六百四十六名，超额完成了向外省输送干部的任务。作得较好的单位如松江省农业厅等，在干部工作方面已经做到既不缺额，质量也有一定程度的保证，向上输送干部时不喊困难，增加机构时不伸手要人。
    松江省的培养训练干部工作是有计划地进行的。国家进入建设时期后，对干部的要求极为迫切。如果不是有计划地培养，就很难在质量和数量上满足建设事业发展的要求，其结果不但使干部工作陷于被动，还将因为缺少人材而使国家建设受到影响。今年松江省不但有全省的培养训练干部计划，而且大多数单位都有如何贯彻执行的具体计划。有了具体执行计划的单位，都能够把全年任务按季度加以排列，使自己能够按照计划有条不紊地进行培养训练干部的工作，不但避免了忙乱被动和先紧后松现象，而且使培养训练干部的工作便于检查和不被其他工作挤掉。农业厅的情况就是这样。农业厅不但有农业技术学校和拖拉机学校等有计划地为将来的农业建设培养农业技术干部，同时也能有计划地满足目前的需要。今年该厅需要建立一百八十个农业技术推广站，他们便有计划地开办了八个训练班，训练了一千一百零八名干部，该厅还经常深入到各个学校训练班去检查工作，解决问题，克服培养训练工作中的各种困难。相反地，有些单位因为没有培养训练干部的工作计划，不是干部缺额就是质量达不到要求。
    对于培养训练干部计划的执行，开始不都是很认真的，松江省委和省人民政府就不断地和这些错误态度进行了斗争。例如开始执行计划时，教育厅把订出的计划放在抽屉里既不执行也不研究。工业厅人事科向领导干部提出要贯彻计划时，得到的答复是：“生产很忙，把培养训练干部的计划往后放一放再说吧。”该厅甚至把仅有的一个做培养训练工作的干部调做其他工作。松江省人民法院的领导干部，把培养训练干部当做只是党的组织部和政府人事部门的事情，不予过问。松江省委组织部和省人民政府人事厅发现这些问题后，随即集中力量研究解决。经过研究，发现许多领导干部所以用不负责任的消极态度对待这一工作，主要是因为对国家有计划的经济建设时期培养训练干部工作的重要意义认识不足。根据这种情况，首先从干部思想上解决问题。松江省委副书记和省人民政府主席亲自分别在各机关各单位的负责干部会议上说明培养训练干部对国家建设的重要意义；同时组织各机关各单位的负责干部和做干部工作同志学习各种有关的文件，并请干部工作做得较好的单位介绍经验。在大家的思想认识明确以后，组织部和人事厅又组织重点检查，召开会议，开展批评与自我批评。这样，干部的培养训练工作全面展开了。
   工作展开以后，新的思想障碍又发生了。佳木斯市合作联社的负责干部说：“我们的干部文化低、资历浅，现训练也不赶趟啊！”“做经济工作不简单啊，训练几天能解决啥问题！”有些基本建设单位仍怕培养训练工作影响生产，要等冬季不能施工时再训练干部。有些单位不按条件选送学员。有个储运公司把记帐员、过量员等送到干部学校顶替股长级骨干去学习。有的单位甚至把贪污分子和犯了错误的干部送去学习。有些部门觉得自己的干部质量还可以，怕训练后组织部门摸着底让他们向外输送，因而不开训练班。松江省委组织部和省人民政府人事厅采用召开座谈会发通报等方式对本位主义等错误思想进行了批评，指示各地必须保证按规定条件选送学员。同时，深入到一○三工地创造了施工中培养训练干部的经验，用这个事实教育推动那些认为施工中不能培养干部的单位。经过反复的教育督促，大部负责干部已经认识到大量培养训练干部的意义，把培养训练干部的工作当做干部工作中的“基本建设工作”。松江省商业厅、阿城县委、双城县委等都把这一工作列入部门工作计划之内。领导干部也把它当做重要的领导工作之一，经常在会议上研究讨论，并进行检查和总结。培养训练干部的工作因而能够比较顺利的展开。
    由于各级领导干部的重视，半年来，各单位不但扩大了培养训练干部的机构，配备了二百五十多名干部，并且创造了多种多样的方式进行训练干部的工作。松江省除了采用正规学校的办法培养训练干部外，还根据各方面的需要开办临时的专业性的训练班。目前已经开办的有基本建设、工业、农业、卫生、粮食、林业、合作、司法等专业训练班。为了解决春耕夏锄中的技术指导问题，还开办过专题的农业技术训练班，这些训练班只要紧紧地与中心工作相结合，教学方面掌握少而精的原则，都能够做到既提高干部质量，又解决了当前工作中的关键问题。对于在职干部的培养，也采取了许多行之有效的办法。开办业余学校，进行经常性的业务教育，就是提高在职干部的方法之一。松江省现有的学校和训练班只能完成百分之三十在职干部的训练任务，工作又要求干部普遍提高。开办业余学校是解决这个问题的有效方法。松江省与哈尔滨市现在已经合办了业余工业大学，省设计公司开办了业余技术学校和干部工作讲座。这些学校都能够较系统地提高干部的业务水平。随着工作的发展，需要不断地提拔干部，制定干部后备名单，是一种有计划、有目标地培养和提拔干部的方法；制定干部后备名单的办法是：各部门根据自己的情况将干部排队，由领导方面研究确定那些干部可以提拔为科长，那些人可以提拔为股长等。名单确定之后，即指定专人负责培养教育，使其在一定时期内具备相当的领导能力。这样，在工作发展或需要向上输送干部时，本单位的工作就不致受到影响。除此，许多单位还采取了组织业务研究会、专题讨论会、技术或先进经验讲座、带徒弟、或通过布置、总结和检查工作等方式来有意识地提高干部的业务水平。这些办法只要不流于形式主义，就都有利于干部的生长。
