Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 27th: Volunteer Army POW Wang Xu, who was repatriated on the 25th by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, said that as the explanation work approached, the US special agents in the camp prepared to hold our POWs hostage for a "demonstration" and put forward three demands to sabotage the explanation work: (1) Explanation representatives must enter the camp to explain; (2) Only collective explanations are accepted; (3) Open the barbed wire gates between small camps of 500 people each. He said: "I heard the special agents talking about how if the explanation representatives entered the camp, they would insult them, beat them, and if necessary, kill them, so that the explanation work could not be carried out at all. Opening the gates between the camps would make it even easier for the special agents to contact each other."

Wang Xu had previously been in charge of administrative work in the Fourth Brigade of the Third Regiment of the Jeju Island Third Prisoner-of-War Camp. Therefore, he knew many inside stories about the US authorities and Chiang Kai-shek bandit spies conspiring to sabotage the explanation work. That's why after he escaped from the camp and requested repatriation, the special agents in the camp panicked. The special agents even detained a major and a lieutenant of the Indian custodial forces for a time, demanding that Wang Xu be handed back to them. This also shows how rampant the special agent activities in the camp were.

According to Wang Xu, the special agents brought radios into the camps under the control of the Neutral Nations Supervision Commission in order to receive secret instructions from the US side. He pointed out that there was a radio station in Camp No. 25, which was in charge of a "principal" from the CIE "school" of the US intelligence agency. In the camp, he also saw an mimeographed publication produced by the special agents. The special agent bosses tied this publication to stones and transmitted it to various camps to instruct special agent activities and conduct reactionary deceptive propaganda. In addition, they also used semaphore, tied letters to the necks of the police dogs they brought in to transmit information and direct special agent activities. On the morning of September 14, after Chinese People's Volunteer Army POW Gui Rangpin climbed over the barbed wire fence of the camp and escaped, Wang Xu saw the special agents use these methods to direct various camps to strengthen their guard. Later, the special agents patrolled and guarded every night with shovels, kitchen knives, and wooden sticks. He also saw three Chiang Kai-shek special agents from Taiwan who had originally been on Jeju Island acting as "UN military interpreters" and frequently contacting the special agents in various camps. On the 25th, when he was repatriated to Panmunjom and got off the bus, he recognized Chiang Kai-shek special agent Wei Jingmeng, who appeared as a "UN military correspondent."

Wang Xu said: Because our POWs continued to break through special agent control and demand repatriation after arriving at the camps under the control of the Neutral Nations Supervision Commission, the special agents were extremely anxious. They frantically carried out terrorist control over our POWs, and even continued to forcibly tattoo characters on the bodies of the prisoners of war. Some people were tattooed with more than eighty characters. Wang Xu personally saw a tall POW who was suspected by special agents have the words "Anti-Communist" tattooed on his forehead. The special agents threatened: If anyone escapes again, the characters will be tattooed on their faces! Anyone who wants to return home will be killed if caught.

Wang Xu pointed out that in order to sabotage the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides, the US side made various arrangements in advance. He said that shortly after the agreement on the prisoner-of-war repatriation issue was reached on June 8, the CIE special agent agency under the US military headquarters in Tokyo sent a tall American who called himself a "doctor" to the Third Prisoner-of-War Camp to summon the special agents to arrange work. At 8:00 a.m. on July 19, Colonel Hansen and Colonel Osman, two "psychological warfare experts" from Tokyo, summoned special agents and POWs in charge of administrative work at the Mosepho US Military Police Headquarters for a meeting. At that time, Wang Xu personally heard them openly mobilize and say: "If you can guarantee that no one returns to the Communists after you arrive in the demilitarized zone, you will be saving face for the United States!" On July 20, Colonel Osman held the same meeting in the Third Regiment, he said: "After arriving in the demilitarized zone, you can take any action to cause trouble for the Indians. They dare not cause you trouble. When the CCP representatives explain to you, you can scold them and beat them. Try to control the prisoners of war and say as little as possible, only say that you want to go to Taiwan."

In early August, the translator of Colonel Nolsam, the US military commander of the Third Prisoner-of-War Camp on Jeju Island, Chiang Kai-shek special agent "Teacher Shi," gave the CIE "school principal" of the Third Regiment an order. At 6:00 p.m. that night, when the "Deputy Brigade Commander" of the Fourth Brigade held a meeting to convey the order, Wang Xu saw the original text of the order in his notebook. The order stipulated: (1) Each brigade must list the names of "wavering and suspicious elements" and kill them all before arriving in the demilitarized zone; (2) Establish core secret groups to closely monitor the prisoners of war; (3) After arriving at the Neutral Nations Supervision Commission camp, use police dogs, bugles, flags, and opportunities such as going on errands and seeing a doctor to contact each other. The first and second items of this order were carried out that night. Only a group of arrested "wavering elements" were not killed, because the US military said that if they were killed at this time, the United States would not be able to escape responsibility. It would be better to take them to the Neutral Nations Supervision Commission camp and see what happens before killing them. At that time, it could be said that the prisoners of war fought each other to death. Wang Xu said: "Before I escaped from the camp, there were still five people detained inside. One of them, the special agents were prepared to kill on the 25th." According to Wang Xu, the special agents had brought many knives into the camp, some of which were brought in in the hidden compartments at the bottom of wooden boxes, and some were brought in wrapped in cloth on the handles of round fans. Moreover, on September 7, the day before they departed from Jeju Island, the "Deputy Regiment Commander" of the Third Regiment told the special agents and administrative personnel of each brigade many ways to murder our POWs who wanted to return home. One way was to hang the prisoners of war with ropes, and then fabricate a suicide note, saying that he committed suicide because he did not want to return to the mainland; another was to put iron powder in the rice for the prisoners of war to eat, so that no traces of injury could be found after death. Wang Xu said that this kind of iron powder was also brought into the camp.

    我志愿军被俘人员王旭
    揭露美方利用蒋李特务破坏解释工作阴谋
    【新华社开城二十七日电】二十五日经中立国遣返委员会遣送回来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员王旭说，营场里的美方特务分子在解释工作临近的时候，准备挟持我方被俘人员进行“示威”，提出破坏解释工作的三点要求：（一）解释代表要进营场解释；（二）只接受集体解释；（三）打开五百人一个的小营场之间的铁丝网门。他说：“我曾听特务们谈过，如果解释代表进了营场，就准备侮辱他们，打他们，必要时杀了他们，使解释工作根本弄不成，打开营场之间的门，就更便利于特务互相联系。”
    王旭过去曾在济州岛第三战俘营第三联队第四大队担负过行政工作，因此，知道美方当局和蒋匪特务预谋破坏解释工作的许多内幕情形。所以他逃出营场要求遣返后，营场内的特务就着了慌。特务们竟一度把印度看管部队的一个少校和一个中尉扣留起来，要求把王旭交还给他们。从这一点也可看出营场内的特务活动是多么猖獗。
    据王旭说，特务们把电台带进了中立国看管的营场里，以便接受美方的秘密指令。他指出，在二十五号营场内就有一部电台，这部电台是由美国特务机关CIE“学校”的一个“校长”负责的。在营场里，他还看到特务们出的一种油印刊物。特务头子把这种刊物绑在石头上传至各营场以指示特务活动和进行反动欺骗宣传。此外，他们还用打旗语、把信绑在他们带进去的警犬脖子上传递信息和指挥特务活动。九月十四日清晨，中国人民志愿军被俘人员贵让品在攀越营场铁丝网逃出以后，王旭曾看到特务们用这些方法指挥各营场，加强警戒，以后特务每夜都拿着铁锹、菜刀和木棍等巡逻放哨。他还看到三个原在济州岛的台湾蒋匪特务在充当“联合国军译员”经常与各营场的特务进行联系。就在二十五日他在被遣返到板门店下车之时，他就认出了一个以“联合国军战地记者”身分出现的蒋匪特务魏景蒙。
    王旭说：由于我方被俘人员在到达中立国看管营地后，不断有人突破特务控制要求遣返，特务分子们极为着急，他们疯狂地对我方被俘人员进行恐怖控制，并且竟继续强迫在战俘身上刺字。有的人被刺上了八十多个字。王旭亲眼看到一个高高的被俘人员因受到特务怀疑，他的额上就被刺了“反共”两个字。特务们并威胁说：如果再有人逃跑，就都要把字刺在脸上！想回国的人抓住就要被弄死。
    王旭指出，为了破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作以及朝中方面的解释工作，美方在事前作了种种布置。他说，在六月八日战俘遣返问题达成协议后不久，东京美军总部所属的CIE特务机关，便派了一个自称“博士”的高个子美国人到第三战俘营召集特务们布置工作。七月十九日上午八时，又有两个从东京来的“心理战专家”汉生上校和奥斯门上校在摹瑟浦美军宪兵司令部召集战俘营特务分子及担负行政工作的被俘人员开会。当时，王旭曾亲自听见他们公开动员说：“你们到非军事区后，如能保证没有一个人回到共产党去，就是给美国争了面子！”七月二十日，奥斯门上校又在第三联队召开同样的会议，他说：“到非军事区后，你们可以采取任何行动找印度人的麻烦，他们是不敢找你们麻烦的。中共代表向你们解释时，你们可骂就骂，可打就打，尽量控制战俘少说话，只说要到台湾去。”
    八月初旬，济州岛第三战俘营美军长官诺尔萨姆上校的翻译、台湾蒋匪特务“史老师”曾交给第三联队CIE“学校校长”一道命令。这天晚上六点钟当四大队“大队副”开会传达时，王旭在他的笔记本上就看到了这个命令的原文。这个命令规定：（一）要各大队列出“动摇可疑分子”的名单，在到达非军事区以前把他们全部杀掉；（二）建立核心秘密小组，严密监视战俘；（三）到中立国看管营地后用警犬、吹号、旗子及出公差、看病等机会进行联络。这项命令的第一、第二项在当夜都执行了，只有逮捕起来的一批“动摇分子”没有杀，因为美军说这时杀掉了他们，美国就脱不了干系，不如把他们带到中立国看管营场后看情形再杀掉，那时可说是战俘互相殴斗致死。王旭说：“在我逃出营场以前，有五个人还押在里面。其中一个，特务们准备在二十五日加以杀害。”据王旭知道，特务们已带了许多刀子进入营场，有的是放在木箱底的夹层里带进去的，有的是用布缠在圆扇柄上带进去的。而且，九月七日，他们由济州岛动身的前一天，第三联队的“副联队长”就曾对各大队的特务及行政人员说了许多谋杀要回国的我方被俘人员的方法，一种是用绳子把战俘吊死，然后捏造遗书，说是他因不愿回大陆而自杀；一种是把铁粉放在饭里给战俘吃，这样死后检查不出伤痕。王旭说，这种铁粉也带进了营地。
