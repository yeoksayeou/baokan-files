This is the Glory the Motherland Gives Me
	Wu Chuanyu

	I grew up in Indonesia. Since returning to the motherland in 1951, I have received warm care from the people of the motherland, which has made me deeply feel the warmth of the motherland. Under the education of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, my political awareness and cultural level have improved. I have realized that every athlete in New China bears the glorious task of improving the people's health and working ability, and is not just for the entertainment of the idle class as in the old society.

	Last year, I represented the motherland in the 15th International Olympic Games held in Finland. Following that, I participated in the 6th International Student Union Sports Performance hosted by the International Student Union Council and won the 100-meter backstroke championship.

	This year, before we went to Bucharest, the capital of Romania, to participate in the 4th World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival, we stayed in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, for about two weeks. There, the Soviet elder brother prepared a large car for our swimmers, taking us to and from the swimming pool for practice every day, and also sent the best swimming instructor to help us practice. I told the Soviet swimming instructor: "My best record for the 100-meter backstroke in China is one minute and eleven seconds six." When we tried swimming in the pool, the Soviet swimming instructor found that my fingers were not closed, my starting posture was incorrect, and my physical strength was insufficient. Based on these shortcomings, he told me the correct practice methods and helped me revise my practice plan. Previously, I practiced once a day after 2:00 PM. Each time, I started with slow swimming, then leg kicks and arm strokes. This made me very tired when practicing fast swimming, so my progress was very slow. From September last year to before leaving the country this year, my score only improved by one-tenth of a second. After the Soviet swimming instructor's guidance, I changed my practice method, practicing twice a day, in the morning for physical strength and in the afternoon for speed. When starting practice, I would first do gymnastics and warm-up exercises, and then practice fast swimming. The swimming methods were different every day, such as quickly swimming four times twenty-five meters on the first day, resting for two minutes each time; quickly swimming five times twenty-five meters on the second day, resting for one minute each time; quickly swimming six times twenty-five meters on the third day, resting for forty-five seconds each time. ... This method not only reduces the consumption of physical strength, but also maximizes one's physical strength. On the twelfth day, five Soviet national referees gave me a formal test. At this time, my 100-meter backstroke score had already improved to one minute and six seconds four (in a 25-meter swimming pool). They also issued a certificate to me.

	On August 4th, the International Friendship Sports Competition of the festival officially opened. On the 6th, I participated in the preliminary round of the men's 100-meter backstroke, with a score of one minute and eleven seconds seven. The score in the semi-final the next day was one minute and nine seconds. However, I felt that I had not used all my strength, so I was confident that I would get a better score in the final.

	At 4:00 PM on August 9th, the backstroke final began. I was very nervous at the time. Being timid during the competition would affect speed, so I immediately thought of the people of the motherland hoping that I would achieve excellent results, and I also thought of the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers. They risked their lives to resist US aggression and aid Korea, defending the motherland, while I did not have to risk any lives. As long as I exerted my strength as much as possible, I could win glory for our great motherland. Thinking of this, I calmed down.

	After the starter gave the signal, the seven finalists jumped into the water and took their ready positions. As soon as the starting gun fired, we all started swimming at the same time. My starting action was poor, as the Soviet coach had reminded me in Moscow. Due to the short practice time, I could not immediately correct my starting action. I swam forward at top speed, side by side with other swimmers. While swimming, I paid close attention to the swimmers from Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, because their records in the semi-finals were very close to mine. After swimming about sixty meters, the Czechoslovakian swimmer had fallen behind a bit. At about eighty meters, I was still swimming side by side with a Soviet swimmer and a Hungarian swimmer. I put in another effort, using all my strength to swim forward, and as a result, I surpassed my two opponents slightly. In the end, I won the 100-meter backstroke championship with a score of one minute and eight seconds four. The Hungarian swimmer won second place, and the Soviet swimmer won third place.

	When I came out of the water, I was greeted by thunderous applause from the audience. The Chinese representatives who came to watch the competition were even more excited because their country's athlete had won the championship. About ten minutes later, the awards ceremony began. With an excited heart, I stepped onto the awards platform. The chairman of the swimming competition committee first hung a gold medal around my neck, and then warmly congratulated me on my victory; then he awarded a silver medal to the second place winner and a bronze medal to the third place winner. They also presented us with bouquets of beautiful flowers.

	After the awards ceremony, our national anthem was played, and the national flags of the Soviet Union, China, and Hungary were slowly raised.

	At this moment, I couldn't help but think that this was the first time China had won first place in an international sports competition. With Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the Chinese people have gained this glory. I fully realize that our victory is inseparable from the selfless help of our Soviet friends, and I will always learn from the Soviet Union. In the future, I will practice even more diligently and help my comrades improve their swimming skills so that we can have more opportunities to win greater glory in future international competitions.

    这是祖国给我的光荣
    吴传玉
    我生长在印度尼西亚。一九五一年我回到祖国以后，受到祖国人民热情的照顾，这使我深深感到祖国的温暖。在中国共产党和人民政府的教育下，我的政治觉悟和文化水平都有了提高。我认识到每一个新中国的运动员担负着提高人民健康水平和劳动能力的光荣任务，他不是像在旧社会里那样只给有闲阶级消遣。
    去年我代表祖国参加了在芬兰举行的第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会。接着，我又参加了国际学联理事会主持的国际学联第六届理事会体育表演，获得了一百公尺仰泳冠军。
    今年，在我们去罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特参加第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节以前，我们在苏联首都莫斯科停留了大约两个星期。在那里，苏联老大哥为我们游泳员准备了一辆大汽车，每天接送我们到游泳池去练习，同时还派了一位最好的游泳指导帮助我们练习。我告诉苏联游泳指导：“我在中国一百公尺仰泳的最高成绩是一分十一秒六。”当我们在游泳池里试游时，苏联游泳指导发现我手指没有并拢、起跳姿势不正确以及体力不够等缺点。他就根据这些情况，告诉我正确的练习方法，并帮助我修订了练习计划。以前，我每天在下午两点钟以后练习一次。每次练习时，都是先练慢游，然后练打腿、划手。这样在练习快游时，已经很疲累了，因此成绩提高得很慢，从去年九月到今年出国前，成绩只提高了十分之一秒。经过苏联游泳指导指点后，我就改变了练习方法，每天练习两次，上午练体力，下午练速度。开始练习时，先做体操和准备活动，接着就练习快游。游的方法每天不一样，如第一天是快速游四次二十五公尺，每次休息二分钟；第二天是快速游五次二十五公尺，每次休息一分钟；第三天是快速游六次二十五公尺，每次休息四十五秒钟。……这个方法不但可以减少体力的消耗，同时可以使自己的体力得到最大的发挥。到了第十二天，苏联的五个国家裁判员给我作了一次正式的测验。这时我的一百公尺仰泳成绩已经提高到一分六秒四了（二十五公尺的游泳池）。他们还发给我证明书。
    八月四日，联欢节国际友谊体育比赛正式开幕了。六日那天，我参加了男子一百公尺仰泳初赛，成绩是一分十一秒七。第二天复赛的成绩是一分九秒。但是我自己感觉到还没有用尽所有的力量，因此我有信心要在决赛中得到更好的成绩。
    八月九日下午四时，仰泳决赛开始了，当时我心里很慌。在竞赛时胆怯是会影响速度的，于是我立刻想到祖国人民在希望着我得到优异的成绩，我也曾想到中国人民志愿军的英雄们。他们冒着生命危险抗美援朝，捍卫着祖国，而我并不要冒什么生命的危险，只要把自己的力量尽量发挥出来，就可以为我们伟大祖国争取光荣。想到这里，我就镇静下来了。
    发令员发出信号以后，我们七个决赛者跳入水中，采取了准备姿势。枪声一响，我们同时起游。我的起游动作较差，在莫斯科时苏联教练早已提醒过我。由于练习时间的短促，我还不能立刻纠正我的起游动作。我用着最高的速度，和其他游泳选手并肩前进。在游的时候，我非常注意捷克斯洛伐克和苏联的游泳选手，因为在复赛时他们的纪录和我很接近。游了六十公尺左右，捷克斯洛伐克选手已经落后一些，八十公尺左右的时候，我依旧和一个苏联选手及一个匈牙利选手并肩前进。我再加一把劲，用尽所有的气力向前游去，结果超过了两个对手一些。最后我获得了一百公尺仰泳冠军，成绩是一分八秒四。匈牙利选手获得第二名，苏联选手获得第三名。
    当我出水的时候，我受到全场暴风雨般的喝采。来看比赛的中国代表们更是高兴，因为自己国家的选手荣获了冠军。大约十分钟以后，开始了授奖典礼，我带着一颗激动的心，踏上了授奖台。游泳竞赛委员会主席首先把一个金质的奖章挂上我的颈项，然后热烈地祝贺我的胜利；其次把一个银质的奖章授给第二名，把一个铜质的奖章授给第三名。他们还献给我们一束美丽的鲜花。
    授奖典礼结束后，演奏了我国国歌，苏、中、匈三国国旗徐徐升起。
    这时，我不禁想到在国际体育竞赛中，中国第一次获得了第一名的荣誉。有了毛主席，有了共产党，中国人民才获得这个光荣。我充分认识到我们的胜利是和苏联朋友的大公无私的帮助分不开的，我要永远向苏联学习。以后我要更认真地练习，并帮助我的同志们提高游泳技术，使我们可以有更多的机会在将来国际竞赛中获得更大的光荣。
