    Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government
    Instructions on Procuratorial Work in the Election of the National and Local People's Congresses
    The Central People's Government Committee, at its 20th meeting on January 13, 1953, passed the "Resolution on Convening the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses at All Levels," and promulgated the "Election Law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and Local People's Congresses at All Levels" on March 1st. This indicates that our people's democratic dictatorship is about to enter a more complete and consolidated stage. Now, grass-roots election work in various regions is about to be universally launched. During the election period, in all areas where People's Procuratorates are established, the People's Procuratorates should closely cooperate with the election work as one of the main current tasks, supervise the accurate implementation of the Election Law from the perspective of procuratorial work, and report all illegal acts in the election to ensure the smooth completion of the election work.
    (1) In order to ensure the implementation of Articles 62, 63, and 64 of the Election Law, in all areas where People's Procuratorates are established, the People's Procuratorates shall accept the accusations and complaints of the people, or based on the reports of procuratorial correspondents, file public prosecutions with the People's Courts or People's Tribunals against those who use illegal means such as violence, threats, fraud, and bribery to undermine the election or obstruct voters from freely exercising their right to vote, as well as those who commit illegal acts such as forging election documents, fabricating votes, and concealing facts. If any organization or individual commits criminal acts of suppressing or retaliating against the people's accusations and complaints, the People's Procuratorate shall be responsible for investigation and file a public prosecution in accordance with the law.
    (2) In order to ensure the implementation of Articles 4 and 5 of the Election Law, in all areas where People's Procuratorates exist, the People's Procuratorate shall supervise the lawful conduct of the voter qualification review work, and participate as much as possible in the trial of litigation cases related to voter qualifications as stipulated in Article 45 of the Election Law by the People's Tribunals or People's Courts, and supervise their judgments in accordance with the law.
    People's Procuratorates at all levels should, in the general election work, be under the leadership of the local government and in contact with the local election committee, so as to facilitate the above-mentioned work. In particular, it is necessary to widely publicize the Election Law in order to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in the election and make the masses fully value their electoral rights. In areas with People's Procuratorate correspondents, the strength of the Procuratorate correspondents should be mobilized and organized to promptly reflect various illegal acts in the election. In order to create pilot experience for general elections, the Provincial People's Procuratorate and Provincial Branch should assign certain cadres to participate in the election experiment work in key counties and townships, summarize experience at any time, inform the subordinate People's Procuratorates, and report to this Procuratorate at each level.

    中央人民政府最高人民检察署
    关于在全国及地方各级人民代表大会选举工作中检察工作的指示
    中央人民政府委员会于一九五三年一月十三日第二十次会议通过了“关于召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的决议”，并于三月一日公布了“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”，这表示我们人民民主专政的国家制度即将进入一个更加完备和更加巩固的阶段。现在各地基层选举工作即将普遍地展开。在选举期间，凡设有人民检察署的地区，人民检察署均应密切配合选举工作，作为当前主要工作任务之一，从检察工作方面监督选举法的确切执行，检举选举中的一切违法行为，以保证选举工作任务的顺利完成。
    （一）为保障选举法第六十二条、第六十三条、第六十四条规定的实施，凡设有人民检察署的地区，人民检察署应接受人民的检举和控告，或根据检察通讯员的报告，对于在选举中有采用暴力、威胁、欺诈、贿赂等非法手段破坏选举或阻碍选民自由行使其选举权利的违法行为，以及犯有伪造选举文件、虚造票数、隐瞒蒙混等违法行为者，向人民法院或人民法庭提起公诉。如有任何机关或个人对于人民的检举、控告有压制、报复之犯罪行为者，人民检察署应负责检查，并依法提起公诉。
    （二）为保障选举法第四条及第五条规定的实施，凡有人民检察署的地区，人民检察署应监督选民资格审查工作的依法进行，并尽可能参加人民法庭或人民法院审理选举法第四十五条所规定的有关选民资格的诉讼案件，监督其依法判决。
    各级人民检察署在普选工作中应在当地政府领导下和当地选举委员会取得联系，以利上述各项工作的进行。特别是广泛宣传选举法，以发挥群众参加选举的积极性，使群众充分重视自己的选举权利。在有人民检察通讯员的地区，应动员组织检察通讯员的力量，及时反映选举中的各种违法行为。省人民检察署及省分署为创造普选试点经验，应指派一定干部参加重点县、乡选举试验工作，随时总结经验，通报所属人民检察署，并层报本署。
          中央人民政府最高人民检察署
                    一九五三年九月十五日
