    Improving Leadership, Strengthening Unity, and Steadily推进推进教学改革——A Few Experiences from Attending the National Conference of Administrative Leaders of Higher Industrial Schools
    President of Tangshan Railway College, Gu Xi
    In June 1950, Chairman Mao made the following instructions regarding educational reform: "Reform the old school education and old social culture in a step-by-step and cautious manner, and strive for all patriotic intellectuals to serve the people. On this issue, the idea of delaying and being unwilling to reform is wrong, and the idea of being too hasty and attempting to reform with crude methods is also wrong." The actual work in the past three years has shown that those who consciously followed Chairman Mao's instructions have achieved success, and those who violated Chairman Mao's instructions and blindly carried out work have stumbled and made mistakes, thus causing losses to the country's education construction.
    Due to insufficient understanding of the necessity, complexity, long-term nature, and unevenness of higher education reform work, many shortcomings and errors have arisen in actual work over the past three years. Before the ideological reform and learning movement, due to our low ideological awareness, vague political understanding, and lack of concrete analysis of the essence of things, we believed that higher education had become worker class-led and of a new democratic nature after liberation, and that everything was fine. Therefore, we lacked vigilance against bourgeois ideology, and we were not clear in our minds on how to specifically establish worker class ideological leadership within the schools, and how higher education institutions could actually serve the people and national construction. Therefore, there was a tendency to delay reform in the actual work at that time. After the ideological reform and learning movement, this tendency was overcome, and the significance of Chairman Mao's instruction that "ideological reform, first of all the ideological reform of various intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reform and gradually implement industrialization" was truly realized in practice. The victory of the ideological reform and learning movement has brought significant achievements to the subsequent adjustment of departments and teaching reform, and has brought a new atmosphere to various tasks within the school. However, because our school leadership had insufficient understanding of the complexity, long-term nature, and unevenness of ideological reform and teaching reform, there were "hasty" and "crude" biases in actual work. For example, some comrades, because they did not understand the long-term nature of ideological reform, often impatiently shouted about the "restoration" of bourgeois ideology; some staff members regarded teachers as another class in the school, and had antagonistic emotions as soon as they heard that they should serve teaching; some senior students complained that teachers' teaching reforms were too slow and too little; in revising teaching plans, generally, they all required the professional training goals and the teaching goals of each course to catch up with the Soviet standards... Coupled with the subjective and formalistic approach to leadership and work methods, all work was carried out comprehensively and completed within a limited time, regardless of conditions, which further fueled the development of "excessive demands" and a tense and busy phenomenon. Therefore, correcting this tendency, improving leadership, strengthening unity, and steadily推进推进教学改革 have become the central tasks for us in the coming period.
    The recently convened National Conference of Administrative Leaders of Higher Industrial Schools appropriately solved the problems that exist in our actual work, clearly defined the working principles, and pointed out the steps and methods for carrying out the work. In the past three years, especially in the past year, the progress of various higher industrial schools has been great, but in order to make faster progress in the future, the conference focused on examining the shortcomings and errors in the past work, and focused on finding the reasons for these shortcomings and errors from the leadership aspect. In this way, the conference achieved significant achievements and provided favorable conditions for overcoming shortcomings and errors in the future. The leading comrades of the higher education department reviewed the shortcomings and errors in the leadership work at the meeting, expressed the determination to improve leadership, and proposed specific methods to improve leadership. At the same time, it was also reflected in the progress of leadership work during the meeting. This spirit of self-criticism from the leadership of the higher education department has educated the leaders of various schools, pointed out the direction and methods for improving school leadership, and enabled the principles and policies of higher education, the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and the leadership and work methods of the mass line to be better implemented in the leadership work of the school.
    In the past year, our understanding of how to learn from the Soviet Union in conjunction with reality has been incomplete and unclear. We have had a high degree of enthusiasm for learning from the Soviet Union, but because the question of "how to learn" has not been well resolved, we have neglected this important aspect of combining with reality. And the facts of the past year have shown that the degree of combining with reality determines the effectiveness of learning from the Soviet Union, and this is the case in a school, a department, a major, a teaching and research group, and a course. From the perspective of a school, I believe that in order to solve this problem, we should formulate a relatively long-term outline plan based on the general line and general tasks of the current transition period, the national higher education development plan, and the advanced experience of similar schools in the Soviet Union, and according to this plan, determine the school's basic construction plan, equipment addition plan, and various types of faculty's annual balance plan, and so on. This will enable the school leadership to have a clear understanding, and the phenomenon of blindness and busyness in the school's work can be gradually reduced. And because the vast number of teachers, students, and staff can clearly see the prospects for the school's development, they will receive practical patriotic ideological education, and will generate infinite power in their work and study, and their enthusiasm and initiative in work and study can be highly developed. From the perspective of a major, I believe that first of all, the training goals of this major should be determined based on the requirements of the business departments, the specific situation of the school's teachers and students, and the guidance of Soviet experts. The training goals of each major should be specific and clear, and the relevant teachers and students should have a consistent understanding in this regard. Then, based on the professional training goals, the actual situation of the major's teachers and students, and the teaching plan of the same major in the Soviet Union, the teaching plan of the major should be formulated. In this way, the textbook compilation plan will have a basis, and the training and improvement of teachers will have specific goals.
    Experience has shown that the training and improvement of teachers is the key to successfully carrying out teaching reform. To do this work well, we must first solve the unity problem. In the past, because some teachers did not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of unity, there were often phenomena of disunity or insufficient unity due to some minor issues, and they could not consciously use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to help each other and strengthen unity. The excessive concerns of some older teachers caused by the extreme emotions and subjective one-sidedness in the ideological reform and learning movement, and the dissatisfaction with certain young teachers; as well as the self-importance of some young teachers and the underestimation of the role played by older teachers in teaching, have also affected the unity among teachers and the development of teacher training and improvement work. The school leadership should effectively solve these problems in the future. Secondly, the problem of insufficient number of teachers must be solved. Due to the insufficient number of teachers, teachers have an excessive teaching burden, and do not have the spare energy and time to study, which also affects the training and improvement of teachers. Although the solution to this problem is still somewhat difficult at present, the situation is improving year by year, especially after this summer vacation, the conditions in this regard are even better, so we are also confident that we will gradually solve this problem. Third, the work of training and improving teachers should be carried out with goals, plans, and steps. As long as the outline plan for the school's development and the teaching plans for each major are determined, the annual balance plan for various types of teachers and the annual improvement plan for the quality of teachers can be formulated. With a plan, we can follow the plan, proceed in an orderly manner, and strive to achieve the predetermined goals.
    The improvement of teachers' Marxist-Leninist theoretical level has a decisive significance for the successful teaching reform. As Comrade Stalin said: "In any department of state work and party work, the higher the political level and the degree of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff, the higher the work itself, the more effective it is, and the more effective the results of the work..." This is a truth that has been proven by the practice of millions of people, and it is equally applicable to the teaching reform work in our higher education institutions. From the practice of the past three years, the vast majority of teachers have realized the importance of studying Marxism-Leninism, and therefore the consciousness and enthusiasm for learning are gradually increasing. The recent three months of studying "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" have achieved preliminary results, and the basic viewpoints of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" have been widely guiding the thinking and work of teachers. However, in the past, there were still some problems in our teachers' studies, such as insufficient learning guidance, excessive learning demands, and certain formalism in learning methods. Therefore, we should strengthen learning guidance in the future, promote the spirit of seeking truth from facts in the learning process, and on the one hand, recognize the importance of learning, and on the other hand, recognize the long-term nature of learning, everything should proceed from the actual effect of learning, everything should be for improving the actual effect of learning, as long as the actual effect of learning can be continuously improved, the consciousness and enthusiasm for learning will be further improved.
    Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, I feel that as long as we can improve leadership, strengthen unity, discover and master the objective laws of teaching reform, and resolutely implement the resolutions of the National Conference of Administrative Leaders of Higher Industrial Schools, we will certainly be able to complete the glorious task entrusted to us higher industrial education workers by the country.

    改进领导，加强团结，稳步进行教学改革
    ——参加全国高等工业学校行政会议的一点体会
    唐山铁道学院院长  顾稀
    一九五○年六月，毛主席对教育改革曾经作过如下的指示：“有步骤地谨慎地进行旧有学校教育事业和旧有社会文化事业的改革工作，争取一切爱国的知识分子为人民服务。在这个问题上，拖延时间不愿改革的思想是不对的，过于性急、企图用粗暴方法进行改革的思想也是不对的。”三年来的实际工作表明，凡自觉地遵照着毛主席的指示做的都取得了成绩，凡违背了毛主席的指示，盲目地进行工作的都碰了钉子，犯了错误，因而对国家的教育建设造成了损失。
    由于对高等教育改革工作的必要性、复杂性、长期性和不平衡性认识不足，因而这三年来在实际工作中产生了许多缺点和错误。思想改造学习运动以前，由于我们的思想觉悟不高，政治认识模糊，对事物的本质缺乏具体的分析，以为解放后高等教育已成为工人阶级领导的、新民主主义性质的，一切都没有问题了，因而对资产阶级思想缺乏警惕，对在学校内部如何具体地确立工人阶级思想领导，对高等学校如何实际地为人民大众为国家建设服务等问题，思想上是不明确的，所以在当时的实际工作中存在着拖延不改的倾向。思想改造学习运动后，克服了这种倾向，并且在实践中真正体会到了毛主席指示的“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一”的意义。思想改造学习运动的胜利，使以后的院系调整和教学改革获得了十分重大的成绩，使学校内部的各种工作呈现出一种新的气象。但由于我们学校领导方面对思想改造和教学改革的复杂性、长期性、不平衡性认识不足，因而在实际工作中又产生了“性急”和“粗暴”的偏向。例如：有些同志由于不了解思想改造的长期性，常常急躁地叫嚷资产阶级思想的“复辟”；有的职工把教师看成学校中的另一阶级，一听到要为教学服务，就有对抗情绪；有些高年级学生埋怨教师的教学改革太慢太少；在修订教学计划中，一般的都要求专业培养目标及各课程教学目标赶上苏联的标准……加上领导方法和工作方法上的主观主义、形式主义，各种工作不问条件，总是全面开展，限期完成，这就更助长了“要求过急”和紧张忙迫现象的发展。因之纠正这种倾向，改进领导，加强团结，稳步进行教学改革，就成为我们今后一个时期的中心任务。
    最近召开的全国高等工业学校行政会议适当地解决了我们在实际工作中存在的问题，明白地确定了工作方针，指明了工作进行的步骤和方法。三年来特别是最近一年来，各高等工业学校的进步是很大的，但为了今后能够更快地进步，会议着重检查了过去工作当中的缺点和错误，又着重地从领导方面找出产生这些缺点和错误的原因。这样，使会议获得了重大的成就，并为今后克服缺点和错误提供了有利条件。高等教育部门的领导同志在会议上检讨了领导工作上的缺点和错误，表示了改进领导的决心，提出了改进领导的具体办法，同时在会议进行中又体现出领导工作已在实际地改进着。高等教育部门领导方面的这种自我批评精神，教育了各校的领导人，提示了改进学校领导的方向和方法，使高等教育的方针政策，实事求是的工作精神，群众路线的领导方法和工作方法，能更好地贯彻在学校的领导工作中。
    过去一年来，我们对怎样结合实际学习苏联，在认识上是不完整的，不明确的。我们对学习苏联虽有高度的热情，但由于“如何学法”这个问题没有很好解决，因而忽视了结合实际这一重要的方面。而一年来的事实表明；结合实际的程度如何，决定了学习苏联的效果如何，这无论在一个学校，一个系，一个专业，一个教研组，一门课程都是如此。从一个学校来说，我认为要解决这个问题，就应根据当前过渡时期的总路线总任务，根据全国高等教育的发展计划，根据苏联同类学校的先进经验，制订一个较长期的轮廓计划，据此计划来确定学校的基本建设计划，设备添置计划，各种类的师资逐年平衡计划，等等。这样使学校领导方面能做到心中有数，学校工作中的盲目现象和忙迫现象就可逐渐减少，而广大师生员工因为能清楚地看到学校发展的远景，受到了实际的爱国主义思想教育，工作和学习中将会产生无限的力量，工作和学习的积极性和主动性就可高度地发挥起来。从一个专业来说，我认为首先应根据业务部门的要求，根据学校师生的具体情况，根据苏联专家的指导来确定这一专业的培养目标。各专业的培养目标应该具体、明确，有关师生在这方面应该有一致的认识。而后再根据专业培养目标，根据该专业师生的实际情况，根据苏联相同专业的教学计划，来制订该专业的教学计划，这样，教材编译计划也就有了依据，师资的培养和提高也就有了具体目标。
    经验证明，师资的培养和提高，是能否胜利进行教学改革的关键问题。要做好这项工作，必须首先解决团结问题。过去，由于部分教师对团结的重要性认识不足，因之常常为了一些细小问题，产生不团结或不够团结的现象，不能自觉地运用批评和自我批评的武器来互相帮助，加强团结。思想改造学习运动中的偏激情绪和主观片面所引起的部分年长教师的顾虑过多，和对某些年青教师的不满情绪；以及部分年青教师的自高自满和对年长教师在教学中所起作用的轻视，也影响了教师间的团结以及师资培养和提高工作的开展，这些问题，学校领导方面今后应当有效地予以解决。其次，要解决师资数量不足的问题。由于师资数量不足，教师的教学负担过重，没有余力和时间来进修，也影响了教师的培养和提高。这个问题的解决目前虽还有些困难，但情况是在逐年改善着，特别是在今年暑假以后，这方面的条件更加好些了，所以我们也有信心逐步地解决这一问题。第三，培养和提高师资的工作要有目标、有计划、有步骤地来进行。只要学校发展的轮廓计划及各专业教学计划确定后，各种类师资的逐年平衡计划及师资质量的逐年提高计划就可以拟定出来。有了计划，就可遵照计划，循序渐进，为达到预定的目标而努力了。
    教师的马克思列宁主义理论水平的提高，对胜利地进行教学改革工作有着决定性的意义。正如斯大林同志所说：“在国家工作和党工作任何一个部门中，工作人员底政治水准和马克思列宁主义觉悟程度愈高，工作本身也愈高，愈有成效，工作底结果也愈有效力；……”这是已为千万人的实践证明了的真理，对我们高等学校的教学改革工作来说也同样适用。从三年来的实践中，绝大多数教师已体会到学习马克思列宁主义的重要性，因而学习的自觉性和积极性是在逐渐地提高着。最近三个月的
  “实践论”、“矛盾论”的学习，已收到了初步的效果，“实践论”、“矛盾论”的基本观点已在广泛地指导着教师的思想和工作。但是，过去一时期我们的教师学习中还存在着一些问题，如学习指导不够，学习要求过急，学习方法上存在着某些形式主义等等；因之今后应加强学习指导，提倡学习过程中的实事求是的精神，一方面要认清学习的重要性，另一方面还要认清学习的长期性，一切从学习的实际效果出发，一切为了提高学习的实际效果，只要学习的实际效果能不断地提高，学习的自觉性和积极性就会进一步提高的。
    在马克思列宁主义指导下，我觉得只要我们能改进领导，加强团结，发现和掌握教学改革的客观规律，坚决贯彻高等工业学校行政会议的决议，我们就一定能完成国家交付给我们高等工业教育工作者的光荣任务。
