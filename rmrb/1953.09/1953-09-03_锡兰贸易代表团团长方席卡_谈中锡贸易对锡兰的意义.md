    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 2nd—Fan Xi Ka, head of the Ceylon government trade delegation who came to our country to negotiate the renewal of the Sino-Ceylon trade contract, made a statement to a reporter from the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao on August 28 while passing through Hong Kong. He said, "The 1953 Sino-Ceylon trade contract is being implemented very smoothly." Fan Xi Ka believes that doing business with China "is an extremely smart and correct step" for Ceylon. He also said: "I can say without hesitation that the entire Ceylon today unanimously supports the government in doing business with China."

    Fan Xi Ka further used specific facts to illustrate the benefits Ceylon received from Sino-Ceylon trade. He said: "When we went to China last year, Ceylon's rubber industry was in a very serious crisis. Because the price of rubber in the world market at that time was artificially suppressed to a very low level, many rubber plantations in Ceylon were forced to close down, and many workers also lost their jobs. Ceylon made a deal with China, and China ordered a large amount of rubber from Ceylon at a price much higher than the market price at the time, so that these rubber plantations that were forced to close down could resume production."

    锡兰贸易代表团团长方席卡
    谈中锡贸易对锡兰的意义
    【新华社二日讯】香港消息：前来我国商洽续订中锡贸易合同问题的锡兰政府贸易代表团团长方席卡，在途经香港时曾在八月二十八日对香港大公报记者发表谈话。他说：“一九五三年的中锡贸易合同，已经在很顺利地执行着。”方席卡认为：和中国做生意对锡兰“是极其聪明而正确的一步”。他并说：“我可以毫不踌躇地说：整个锡兰，今天是一致支持政府与中国做生意的。”
    方席卡进一步用具体事实说明中锡贸易使锡兰得到的好处。他说：“当去年我们到中国的时候，锡兰的橡胶工业正陷入极度严重的危机。由于当时世界橡胶市场价格被人为的因素压得极低，锡兰许多橡胶园被迫停业，许多工人也失了业。锡兰和中国作成了生意，中国以比当时市价高出许多的价格向锡兰订购了大量的橡胶，这些被迫停业的橡胶园，才得以重新恢复生产。”
