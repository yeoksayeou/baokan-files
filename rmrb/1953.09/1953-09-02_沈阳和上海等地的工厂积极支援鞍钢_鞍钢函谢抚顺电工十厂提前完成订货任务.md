Factories in Shenyang and Shanghai Actively Support Anshan Iron and Steel

Anshan Iron and Steel Sends Letter Thanking Fushun Electric Engineering Tenth Factory for Completing Orders Ahead of Schedule

Factories in Shenyang and Shanghai are vigorously supporting the basic construction and production of Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

Due to the implementation by the Industry Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China of the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on ensuring the completion of Anshan Iron and Steel's processing orders, the relevant factories were deployed and supervised. The factories in Shenyang have a clearer understanding of the great significance of supporting Anshan Iron and Steel and are actively striving to complete Anshan Iron and Steel's processing orders on schedule. For example, the Second and Fourth Machinery Factories and the Fourteenth Electric Engineering Factory have placed Anshan Iron and Steel's processing orders in a primary position. Each factory has assigned a factory director to specifically lead this work, and the Shenyang Chemical Plant has also assigned a Party branch secretary to a key workshop.

In order to ensure the completion of Anshan Iron and Steel's processing orders, the factories have taken some specific measures. For example, after the Fourth Machinery Factory received a batch of blower orders from Anshan Iron and Steel in July, it drew up a schedule to ensure the completion of the task and posted it in the department. From the department to the last process of production—the assembly workshop—there were dedicated personnel in charge. The factory was afraid that tools, fixtures, and materials would have problems during the production process, so a person was specially assigned to the production department to be responsible for scheduling work. In order to better control and grasp the production of parts, a statistician and a dispatcher were also specially assigned to regularly check the parts warehouse. In order to ensure quality, the inspection department also established six inspection systems. The Fourteenth Electric Engineering Factory also established a professional team to be specifically responsible for Anshan Iron and Steel's processing orders. The factories also strengthened ideological leadership and called on employees to establish an overall concept and put Anshan Iron and Steel's orders first. The Second Machinery Factory and the Fourteenth Electric Engineering Factory have strengthened publicity and mobilization. The Second Machinery Factory seized the first process and mobilized the employees of that process to complete the task ahead of schedule in order to promote the work of other processes.

On August 11, the Industry Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of factory cadres to exchange experiences in supporting Anshan Iron and Steel. Although the factories still have some difficulties, such as the blueprints not arriving in time, the lack of tools, fixtures, and raw materials, they said they would try everything possible to ensure the completion of Anshan Iron and Steel's processing orders on schedule.

In order to put Anshan Iron and Steel's seamless steel pipe plant into production ahead of schedule, the employees of the Shanghai Joint State-Private Hua Tong Electric Motor Factory and the privately-owned Xin Cheng Electric Motor Factory accepted the task of manufacturing a large number of universal conversion control switches, electric steam valves, and starters with great enthusiasm. The employees of the Hua Tong Electric Motor Factory put forward the slogan "Ensure that small switches do not delay large-scale production" and launched a labor emulation campaign. The work related to this task was completed immediately wherever it went without delay. The planner compiled a new work plan, which originally took a week to compile, in three days. During installation, the phenolic molding powder supplied by the joint state-private Tian Shan Chemical Plant was suddenly interrupted due to a broken mold. The workers of the Hua Tong Electric Motor Factory immediately organized a shock team to rush to make molds for the Tian Shan Chemical Plant, trying their best to reduce the time of the supply interruption. The inspectors also stayed in the workshop all the time, inspecting one as soon as it was installed. As a result, the task of manufacturing a large number of universal conversion switches was completed four days ahead of schedule. The many electric steam valves and forty starters undertaken by the Xin Cheng Electric Motor Factory were also delivered twenty days ahead of schedule than originally planned.

Since July, the Harbin Railway Administration has been organizing direct trains to transport materials to Anshan Iron and Steel to support its normal production, with good results. For example, in the past, the ore, mineral powder, and fuel transported from the mines in Fushun, Benxi, Anping, Ganjingzi, and Nanguanling to Anshan Iron and Steel often could not be loaded according to plan because there were no direct trains, resulting in the arrival of too many or too few vehicles at Anshan Iron and Steel, affecting normal production. In July, after the Harbin Railway Administration organized direct trains, the mines basically achieved balanced loading and departure according to plan, and Anshan Iron and Steel also achieved timely receiving and unloading, which provided a strong guarantee for the normal production of Anshan Iron and Steel. At the same time, the railway transportation business has also benefited a lot.

In addition, the Fushun Longfeng Coal Mine is actively repairing old fire areas to increase production and ensure a sufficient supply of coking coal to Anshan Iron and Steel.

The Fushun Electric Engineering Tenth Factory successfully completed Anshan Iron and Steel Company's orders ahead of schedule. Anshan Iron and Steel Company sent a letter to all the employees of the factory on August 10 to express their gratitude. The letter stated: "We sincerely thank you for successfully completing the order for more than 6,000 pieces of high-voltage porcelain materials for the three major projects of the large rolling mill, the seamless steel pipe plant, and the No. 7 blast furnace ahead of schedule, providing a material guarantee for the timely start of the three major projects. For this reason, we would like to extend our revolutionary greetings to all comrades who are actively and selflessly working hard. May we work together for the future industrialization of the motherland."

### 沈阳和上海等地的工厂积极支援鞍钢  鞍钢函谢抚顺电工十厂提前完成订货任务

    沈阳和上海等地的工厂积极支援鞍钢
    鞍钢函谢抚顺电工十厂提前完成订货任务
    沈阳市和上海市等地的工厂大力支援鞍山钢铁公司的基本建设和生产。
    由于中共沈阳市委工业部贯彻了中共中央东北局财经工作部关于保证完成鞍钢加工订货任务的指示，对有关各厂进行了布置与督促检查，沈阳各厂对支援鞍钢的重大意义有了较明确的认识，积极争取按期完成鞍钢加工订货任务。如机械二厂、四厂和电工十四厂都把鞍钢的加工订货任务放在了首要位置。各厂都抽出一名厂长专门领导这一工作，沈阳化工厂并在关键车间配备了一名党支部书记。
    各厂为保证完成鞍钢加工订货任务，采取了一些具体措施。如机械四厂在七月份接受鞍钢一批送风机订货任务后，就排了一个保证完成任务的进度表，贴在科室内，从科室一直到生产的最后一个工序——装配车间都设有专人负责。该厂恐怕工具、卡具和材料在生产中途发生问题，特在生产科设一人专来负责调度工作。为了很好地控制与掌握部件的生产情况，还专设了一名统计员和一名收发员，经常到零件仓库进行检查。为了保证质量，检查科还建立了六种检查制度。电工十四厂也成立了一个专业小组，专门负责鞍钢加工订货任务。各厂还加强了思想领导，号召职工树立整体观念，把鞍钢定货任务放在第一位。机械二厂和电工十四厂都加强了宣传鼓动工作。机械二厂抓住了第一道工序，发动该工序职工提前完成任务，以推动其他工序的工作。
    八月十一日，中共沈阳市委工业部召开工厂干部会议，交流了支援鞍钢工作的经验。各厂虽然还有一些困难，如图纸不能及时到厂，缺乏工具、卡具和原材料，但他们表示要想尽一切办法来保证按期完成鞍钢加工订货的任务。
    为着使鞍钢无缝钢管厂提前投入生产，上海公私合营华通电机厂和私营新成电机厂的职工们，都以极大的热情接受了制造大批万能转换控制开关、电动汽阀和起动机的任务。华通电机厂的职工们提出“保证不让小开关耽误大生产”的口号，展开了劳动竞赛。有关这一任务的工作不论到那里都毫不停留地立即完成。计划员在三天内就把原来需要一个星期才能排好的新的作业计划编好。安装时，由公私合营天山化工厂供给的胶木桃子突然因模子坏了而中断了，华通电机厂的工人们立即组织突击小组为天山化工厂赶制模子，尽力减少了供应中断的时间。检验员们也一直守在车间里，装好一只立即检验一只。结果，提前四天完成了这次承制的大批万能转换开关的任务。新成电机厂所承制的许多电动汽阀和四十部起动机也比原计划提前二十天交货。
    哈尔滨铁路管理局从七月份开始编组直达列车，为鞍钢运送物资，支援鞍钢正常生产，效果很好。比如过去从抚顺、本溪、安平、甘井子、南关岭等各矿山运到鞍钢去的矿石、矿粉和燃料，因为没有直达列车，常常不能按计划均衡地装车，以致到达鞍钢的车辆常常过多或过少，影响正常生产。七月份，哈尔滨铁路管理局编组直达列车后，各矿山基本上做到了按计划均衡装车、发车，鞍钢也做到了按时接车、卸车，使鞍钢的正常生产得到了有力的保证，同时，铁路运输营业方面也得到了不少好处。
    此外，抚顺龙凤煤矿正在积极修复旧火区，以提高产量，保证对鞍钢炼焦煤的充分供应。
    抚顺电工十厂胜利地提前完成了鞍山钢铁公司的订货任务，鞍山钢铁公司特于八月十日写信向该厂全体职工致谢。信中写道：“衷心地感谢您们胜利地提前完成了为大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、七号高炉三大工程制造六千余件高压电瓷材料的订货任务，为三大工程的按期开工提供了物质保证。为此，谨向积极忘我劳动的全体同志致以革命的敬礼。愿共同为祖国工业化前途而努力。”
