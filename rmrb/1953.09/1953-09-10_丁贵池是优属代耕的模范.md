Reader's Letters Abstract:

    Ding Guichi is a Model of Preferential Treatment for Military Dependents in Farming
    Hu Zhen from the People's Government of Shimen County, Hunan Province, writes: Ding Guichi, the village chief of Fudi Village, Gucheng Township, Seventh District of Shimen County, is a mutual aid team leader. Last year, his mutual aid team contracted to farm seven mu of land belonging to Wen Jiji, a military dependent. Wen Jiji's family has a difficult life, and these seven mu of land have consistently yielded little grain each year due to insufficient fertilizer and poor cultivation. In order to enable the military dependent to harvest more grain, Ding Guichi led the farmers of the entire mutual aid team to donate 25,000 jin of pig manure, cow manure, and other fertilizers, applying them to Wen Jiji's seven mu of land. He also found seven oxen and plowed and harrowed these fields four times each, making them meticulous and good. When transplanting rice seedlings, Ding Guichi saw that the seedlings Wen Jiji had kept were yellow and thin, so he replaced them with 360 bundles of his own dark and strong seedlings, encouraging other team members to also replace Wen Jiji's seedlings with good ones; as a result, all of Wen Jiji's seedlings were replaced with good ones. Because the weeding, water conservancy protection, and other work on these seven mu of land were done well, there was no drought or insect plague last year. At the autumn harvest, each mu of land yielded an average of 720 jin of grain. Wen Jiji said happily: "My family has been planting this large field for seventeen years, and we have never harvested so much. The mutual aid team has done such a good job of farming for us, I am truly grateful." Because Ding Guichi led his mutual aid team to do a good job in farming for military dependents, he was honorably elected as a model for farming for military dependents at the Shimen County People's Government's commendation meeting for preferential treatment for military dependents in September last year.
    This spring plowing season, Ding Guichi's mutual aid team continues to contract to farm for Wen Jiji. He first called a meeting of mutual aid team members to summarize last year's farming work and review the shortcomings of last year's farming, which was that there was no distribution of work according to labor, and transplanting, weeding, and harvesting were somewhat chaotic. In response to these shortcomings, they improved their work methods and allocated work according to the strength of labor, with each person responsible for doing their job well. Now the rice in Wen Jiji's fields is growing thick and strong, and it is estimated that this year's yield will be higher than last year's.
    Under the leadership of Ding Guichi's mutual aid team, all thirteen farming teams in Gucheng Township attach great importance to farming work, and their achievements are very good.

    丁贵池是优属代耕的模范
    湖南省石门县人民政府胡真来信：石门县七区古城乡福堤村村长丁贵池，是一个互助组长，去年他的互助组包耕军属文吉级家的七亩田。文吉级家里生活很困难，这七亩田因为施肥不足、耕作不精细，所以年年粮食收得少。丁贵池为了使军属多打粮食，就带动全互助组的农民捐出了二万五千斤猪栏粪和牛栏粪等肥料，施到文吉级的七亩田里去；又找了七条牛，把这些田四犁四耙，做得又细致又好。插秧时，丁贵池看见文吉级留的秧苗又黄又瘦，就把自己的黑壮的秧苗换给他三百六十把，带动了别的组员也把好秧换给文吉级；结果文吉级的秧苗全部换成了好秧。这七亩田因为扯草、防护水利等工作做得好，去年没有发生过旱象，也没有发生过虫灾。秋收时，每亩田平均收了七百二十斤谷。文吉级高兴地说：“这块大田，我家已经种了十七年，从来也没有收过这样多。互助组代耕得这样好，真使我感激。”因为丁贵池领导他的互助组做好了代耕工作，去年九月石门县人民政府召开优属代耕评模大会时，他光荣当选为代耕模范。
    今年春耕开始，丁贵池互助组仍旧给文吉级包耕。他先找互助组员开会，总结去年的代耕工作，检查出去年的代耕缺点是没有按劳分工，插秧、扯草、割谷还有些混乱。他们针对这些缺点，改进工作方法，根据劳力强弱分配了工作，各人负责把自己的工作作好。现在文吉级田里的稻子长得又粗又壮，估计今年的产量比去年还要提高。
    在丁贵池互助组的带动下，古城乡十三个代耕小组都很重视代耕工作，而且成绩很好。
