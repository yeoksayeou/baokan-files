    Longchang County, Sichuan, Exceeds Grain Purchase Plan Under Unified Leadership
    Longchang County, Sichuan Province, exceeded its rice procurement plan by 105% in August, and its sorghum procurement volume exceeded the plan by more than threefold. The main reason for the success of Longchang County's autumn grain procurement work was the correction of the past decentralization in the procurement work. All units unified their division of labor and closely cooperated to carry out the procurement work.
    This year, before the start of the procurement work, the county grain bureau, cooperatives, and specialized companies held a joint meeting to study how to coordinate and cooperate and arrange procurement issues, and signed procurement contracts. For example, in the work of purchasing yellow millet on behalf of the state, in order to avoid duplication of collection points and inconsistent inspection levels, the grain bureau and the cooperative negotiated to adopt a method of comprehensive division of labor and cooperation. The grain bureau was responsible for setting up procurement stations in urban areas, and the cooperatives were entrusted with procurement business in rural areas. Where there were grain bureau warehouses, the grain bureau warehouses were responsible for inspecting quality grades, weighing, receiving, dispatching, and storing grain, and the cooperatives were responsible for settlement, payment, and reporting in the procurement process. The specialized company's task of procuring sorghum was also entirely entrusted to the cooperative. Initially, the cooperative was concerned that sorghum would be difficult to store and lacked sorghum storage equipment, so the grain bureau introduced to the cooperative many experiences in storing sorghum. With the decision of the County Finance Committee, the specialized company also purchased more than 30 million yuan of wooden boards to be handed over to the cooperative for storing sorghum. On August 13, the bank, specialized company, cooperative, grain bureau, and tax bureau jointly issued instructions stipulating that both procurement units and recirculation units should take each market fair as a period, draw up procurement fund and recirculation payment plans, and the bank should uniformly dispatch funds. In the event of a breakthrough in the plan, the bank should be responsible for supplying funds to meet the needs of the procurement unit. After various major issues in the procurement work were resolved uniformly at the county level, the relationship between the grass-roots units presented an unprecedented unity of action and mutual support.
    At the beginning of the procurement, sorghum was marketed fiercely, and fund allocation was difficult, so the bank promptly sent special personnel to send funds to the countryside to support the procurement. Employees of specialized sales outlets in various districts often helped cooperatives study the problem of sorghum storage. When the employees of the specialized sales outlet in the Second District were very busy at the cooperative, they also took the time to help the cooperative with procurement. Grain bureau warehouse employees also often helped cooperative cadres who were unfamiliar with business in preparing reports and settling accounts. The employees of the Second District Bank's business office helped the procurement departments prepare appropriation plans for each market fair, and made payments at any time, regardless of whether it was early or late. Recently, the cooperative, the grain bureau, and the specialized company, under the leadership of the County Financial and Economic Committee, jointly established a procurement office and organized a joint inspection team to further strengthen the relationship between them.
    How does Longchang County do a good job in unified leadership and coordinated actions of various departments in the procurement of autumn grain?
    First, leading cadres of various units conducted policy studies and established an overall concept. In the struggle against bureaucracy, the County Financial and Economic Committee pointed out the importance of unified leadership and coordinated action through typical examples, organized financial and economic department cadres to repeatedly study the state's commercial policies, focusing on criticizing departmentalism; at the same time, it criticized and dealt with individual cadres whose departmentalism was particularly serious and affected their work, and commended units that did a good job in coordinated action. In this way, the overall concept of cadres in the financial and economic departments was strengthened.
    Second, the County Financial and Economic Committee earnestly helped various financial and economic units overcome difficulties. For example, the cooperative and the specialized company once negotiated poorly on the issue of warehouse boards needed for sorghum storage (the specialized company emphasized that there were no instructions from the higher level and dared not make a decision; the cooperative was unable to purchase them due to limited handling fees), so the County Financial and Economic Committee decided that the specialized company should purchase them to ensure that the procurement would not be affected, so that the problem was quickly resolved. During the procurement of sorghum, there was not enough warehouse space, so the County Financial and Economic Committee instructed the district financial and economic group leaders to vigorously assist, and as a result, the problem of lack of warehouses in most areas was also smoothly resolved. The District Chief of the Ninth District also personally led the employees of the cooperative and the specialized sales outlet to find warehouses to store sorghum.
    Third, adhere to the principle of resolving issues through agreements between relevant departments. During this procurement, various major and universal specific issues were uniformly studied and decided by relevant units at the county level, and then notified for implementation. All issues involving both parties were jointly instructed by both parties. When county-level units had disputes that could not be resolved, they were uniformly resolved by the County Financial and Economic Committee. When grass-roots units had disputes, they were uniformly resolved by the district financial and economic group. If the district could not resolve it, it would be reported to the higher-level unit for resolution.
    Fourth, pay attention to resolving legacy issues. The principle of resolving legacy issues is: state-owned commerce must implement the spirit of supporting cooperatives, and cooperatives must also overcome the "free-ride mentality." We must proceed from reality and possibility, do not pursue responsibility rigidly, and should not hinder the current procurement work. For example, before the procurement, the county grain bureau and the cooperative unified and resolved the problems of the poor quality rate, storage fee, pre-purchased grain, storage depreciation, processing, and the misappropriation of grain bureau funds by the grass-roots cooperative last year. Among them, the grain bureau made necessary concessions to the cooperative on issues such as the poor quality rate, pre-purchased grain, and storage depreciation; the cooperative also guaranteed to return the misappropriated funds truthfully; the cooperative's outstanding pre-purchased sorghum to the specialized company last year was also decided to be recovered by the specialized company with the assistance of the cooperative after this year's autumn harvest; the specialized company will return the deducted handling fee to the cooperative.

    四川隆昌县在统一领导下购粮超过计划
    四川省隆昌县八月份超额完成稻谷收购计划百分之一百零五，红粮收购量也超额完成了计划三倍多。隆昌县秋粮收购工作取得成绩的主要原因是纠正了过去收购工作中的分散主义，各单位统一进行了分工，密切地配合展开收购工作。
    今年，隆昌县在收购工作开始以前，县粮食局、合作社和专卖公司就召开了联席会议，研究了如何协同配合、安排收购的问题，并订立了收购方面的合同。例如代购黄谷的工作，为了避免设立收购点的重复和验级不一致的现象，粮食局和合作社协商采取了全面分工配合的办法。粮食局除在城区设收购站外，乡区收购业务就委托给合作社；有粮食局仓库的地方，粮食局仓库负责检验品质等级、过秤、收发和保管粮食，合作社负责收购中的结账、付款，做表报等工作。专卖公司收购红粮任务也全部委托合作社，起先合作社顾虑红粮不好保管，又缺乏保管红粮的设备，粮食局就介绍给合作社许多保管红粮的经验；经县财委决定，专卖公司也添购了三千多万元的木板交给合作社，作为保管红粮之用。在八月十三日，银行、专卖公司、合作社、粮食局、税务局又发出联合指示，规定收购单位与回笼单位都以逢场为一期，编出收购用款和回笼交款计划，由银行统一调度资金；遇到突破计划的情况，银行要负责供应资金，满足收购单位的需要。收购工作中的各种重大问题在县里统一解决后，各基层单位的关系呈现了空前步调一致和互相支援的现象。
    开始收购时，红粮上市很猛，资金拨付困难，银行就及时派专人送款下乡，支持收购。各区专卖分销店职工都经常帮助合作社研究红粮的保管问题。二区专卖分销店职工当合作社很忙时，还抽空帮合作社收购。粮食局仓库职工也经常帮助合作社业务生疏的干部造表报、结账。二区银行营业所职工，每场都帮助收购部门编拨款计划，并且做到不分早晚随时付款。最近，合作社、粮食局和专卖公司又在县财政经济委员会的领导下，联合成立了收购办公室，组织了联合检查小组，进一步密切了互相间的关系。
    隆昌县收购秋粮中是怎样做好统一领导各部门协同动作的呢？
    第一、各单位领导干部进行了政策学习，树立了整体观念。县财政经济委员会在反官僚主义斗争中通过典型事例，指出统一领导、协同动作的重要性，组织财经部门干部反复进行了国家商业政策的学习，着重地批判了本位主义思想；同时并批评和处理了个别因本位主义特别严重影响了工作的干部，表扬了协同动作作得好的单位。这样，就加强了财经部门干部的整体观念。
    第二、县财政经济委员会认真帮助各财经单位克服困难。例如合作社和专卖公司曾经为保管红粮需要仓板的问题，协商不好（专卖公司强调上级没有指示，不敢作主；合作社则因手续费有限，无力购置），县财政经济委员会就决定由专卖公司购置，保证不得影响收购，使问题迅速获得解决。收购红粮中库房不够用，县财政经济委员会就指示区财经小组长大力协助，结果，大部地区的缺乏仓房问题也都得到顺利解决。九区区长还亲自领导合作社和专卖分销店职工找仓库堆存红粮。
    第三、坚持各有关部门协议解决问题的原则。这次收购中，各种重大的及带有普遍性的具体问题，都是由县级各有关单位统一研究协议作出决定，再通知执行。凡是有关双方的问题，都是由双方发出联合指示。县级各单位有问题争执不能解决时，则统一由县财政经济委员会解决。各基层单位有争执时，则统一由区财经小组解决。区里无法解决时才报上级单位解决。
    第四、注意解决遗留问题。解决遗留问题的原则是：国营商业要贯彻扶持合作社的精神，合作社也要克服“沾光思想”。要从实际和可能出发，不要硬追责任，并且不应妨害目前收购工作。如县粮食局和合作社在收购前，曾把去年代购黄谷品质差率、保管费、预购粮、仓储折耗、加工、基层社挪用粮食局粮款等问题，提出来统一协商作了解决。其中，粮食局在品质差率、预购粮、仓储折耗等问题上对合作社都作了必要的照顾；合作社也保证将挪用的粮款照实退回；合作社欠专卖公司去年预购的红粮，也决定按照实际和可能在今年秋收后，由专卖公司协助合作社收回；专卖公司则将扣下的手续费退还给合作社。（本报西南记者站  达武）
