Guangzhou state-owned commercial departments actively supply daily necessities to the people.

    To welcome this year's peak season and supply the people with daily necessities, Guangzhou's state-owned commercial departments have revised and expanded their purchasing and sales plans, procuring 183 types of products, encompassing all department stores and industrial sectors in the city. The total value of processing, ordering, purchasing, and exclusive sales in the third quarter of this year has increased by four and a half times compared to the same period last year, accounting for 82 percent of the total output value of these industries in the third quarter. A large number of industrial products, such as flashlights, batteries, basins, toothpaste, rubber shoes, and plastic products, are transported and sold by the Guangzhou Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Merchandise Corporation to the vast rural areas of South China and grain-producing areas such as Sichuan and Hunan. Currently, Guangzhou's state-owned commercial departments are mobilizing more than 300 knitting factories in the city to vigorously produce autumn and winter goods, such as sweaters and sanitary clothing, to supply the domestic market.

Producing Suitable Overshoes for Farmers

    The Changsha Private Lihua Rubber Factory used to primarily sell overshoes to cities, with styles that were small, had low insteps, and narrow forefeet, which were not suitable for farmers. This year, the factory workers actively suggested improvements in production, changed the size and style of the overshoes, and manufactured overshoes with wide forefeet and high insteps that are suitable for farmers. As a result, sales have greatly increased and are selling well in rural areas. In the first half of this year, the factory sold a total of 200,000 pairs of overshoes, which is approximately equal to the total output of the entire last year.

Shanghai Socks and Underwear Industry Facing the Countryside

    The Shanghai socks and underwear industry pays attention to producing products suitable for farmers' needs. By the end of August, 37 electric hosiery factories had successively modified 202 electric hosiery machines to weave thick cotton socks needed by farmers in winter. These hosiery machines have now produced more than 20,000 dozens of thick cotton socks for supply to various regions. Underwear factories have greatly increased the production of brightly colored and thick-flannel cotton shirts and pants, and sanitary shirts and pants. The factories have particularly increased the production of fully-open sanitary shirts for farmers, and sanitary shirts with turn-down collars and round collars that are popular with workers and students.

New Improvements to "Peacock Spreading its Tail" Printed Cloth

    In early August, the Shanghai Shenxin No. 6 Factory received a letter of suggestion stating that the "Peacock Spreading its Tail" printed cloth is indeed beautiful and lovely, but unfortunately, there is a drawback: when making quilt covers, the peacocks on the two side edges cannot be pieced together into a whole peacock. It would be even better if the peacock pattern could be pieced together. The workers and technicians in the factory's printing and dyeing department felt that this suggestion was very correct. Therefore, the technicians on the engraving, color mixing, and printing machines all engaged in heated discussions. After careful research, they decided to first measure the width of the cloth, and then slightly bring the three peacock patterns in the middle closer together so that half a peacock flower is printed on both sides of the cloth. In this way, they can be pieced together to form a complete peacock spreading its tail pattern. The preparatory work was completed before the end of August, and printing began on September 1st. The printing workers said: We must print the colors of the printed cloth brightly and beautifully to make consumers satisfied.

Supplying a Variety of Winter Clothing

    The Changchun City Company of the China National Merchandise Corporation, having learned from the lessons of the past years when the supply of cotton clothing was not timely, resulting in "first sold out, then overstocked," went to government agencies and factories in the early third quarter of this year to understand the opinions of employees on the styles, specifications, and colors of winter clothing, shoes, and hats. They actively organized the processing of raw materials and held a winter goods sample exhibition to widely solicit public opinion. In late August, they invited salespersons from various department stores and cooperatives to visit the samples and solicit opinions. By early September, the more than 80 types of winter goods samples that were initially processed, such as cotton cadre uniforms, woolen trousers, cotton leather shoes, and leather hats, were able to be as diversified as possible. For the cotton cadre uniforms alone, there were more than 30 types, including zippered, snap-buttoned, and leather-collared ones for men and women. Currently, more than half of the cotton cadre uniforms have been processed according to plan, and more than 2,000 pairs of various cotton shoes have also been processed, and the quality and specifications are relatively good and have already met with customers.

Autumn and Winter Clothing Arrives at Construction Sites

    The service departments of various basic construction sites in Shenyang City have been continuously delivering autumn and winter supplies to the construction sites. Many of these goods are processed according to the production and living characteristics of construction workers. Among them are various clothing and light, soft, and thick-soled cloth shoes that nails cannot penetrate, as well as long-barreled rubber-soled shoes that can withstand cement immersion. In the Nanhai construction site service department, there are beautiful commodities from all over the country. The salespersons are patiently receiving customers. Therefore, in late August, the number of customers at this service department has doubled compared to a month ago.

Signing Heating Coal Supply Contracts

    Coal and Building Materials Stores in various parts of Jilin Province have signed heating coal supply contracts with local government agencies, enterprises, and organizations. According to the contract, the purchasing units can take all the coal for winter use in the third quarter. In this way, in winter, we can concentrate our efforts to supply the needs of the general residents and avoid the phenomenon of queuing to buy coal and being overwhelmed. At present, the total amount of heating coal ordered by government agencies and enterprises from Coal and Building Materials Stores has reached 170,000 tons, and many units have begun to pick up and transport it.

Distributing Sweaters, Yarn, and Cotton to Various Regions

    The Harbin Area Department Store Wholesale Station has prepared most of the autumn and winter supplies needed by the urban and rural people in the area. Various cotton leather shoes, leather hats, cotton coats, and other processing raw materials have been allocated to processing factories to begin processing. Yarn, sweaters, cotton clothing, and cotton rubber shoes purchased from Northeast China and various parts of Guannei have also been successively transported and allocated to department stores in various cities and counties in a timely manner. From early August to August 20th, three trainloads of sweaters and more than 19,000 pounds of yarn were allocated. Batches of cotton have also been allocated to various regions.

    Currently, they are both seizing the procurement of certain insufficient winter goods and organizing processing factories to improve processing varieties and styles, providing a variety of high-quality autumn and winter supplies to the urban and rural people.

Fujian Provincial Department Store Company Expands Business Variety to Meet People's Needs

    In order to fully supply the autumn and winter supplies for the urban and rural people, the China National Merchandise Corporation's Fujian Provincial Company has expanded the system's second-half commodity circulation plan by 30% compared to the original plan, and the business varieties have also increased from more than 2,100 to more than 3,500. The newly added items include canned food, stationery, children's clothing, shoes and hats, toys, etc., which are commodities that have not been operated in the past or have been operated very little. In order to meet the needs of urban and suburban workers, peasants, residents, and students, the Fuzhou Department Store is also preparing to continue to expand the business variety to more than 5,000.

    满足消费者日益增长的需要
    广州国营商业部门积极供应人民日用品
    广州国营商业部门为了迎接今年旺季，供应人民日用品，修改扩大了购销计划，采购产品达一百八十三种，范围遍及全市所有的百货工业行业。今年第三季度加工、订货、收购、包销的总金额比去年同期增加了四倍半，占这些行业三季度生产总值的百分之八十二，大批工业产品如电筒、电池、面盆、牙膏、胶鞋、塑胶制品等，由中国百货公司广州采购供应站运销华南广大农村和四川、湖南等产粮地区。目前，广州国营商业部门正动员该市三百多家针织厂，大力生产秋冬货物绒衫和卫生衣，供应国内市场。　　　　　　　（据新华社讯）
    给农民生产合适的套鞋
    长沙市私营利华橡胶厂，过去生产的套鞋主要是卖给城市的，式样小巧、脚背矮、前掌窄的，不适合农民穿用。今年该厂工人积极建议改进生产，改变了套鞋的尺寸式样，制造了适合农民穿的前掌宽、脚背高的套鞋，因此销售量大大增加，畅销农村。今年上半年该厂共销售了二十万双套鞋，约等于去年全年总产量。
    上海袜子内衣行业面向农村
    上海袜子、内衣行业，注意生产适合农民需要的产品。到八月底，已有三十七家电机织袜厂陆续改装了二百零二台电动织袜机，织农民冬季需用的厚棉毛袜。这些织袜机现已生产两万多打厚棉毛袜供应各地。各内衣厂大量增添了颜色鲜艳和带厚绒的棉毛衫裤和卫生衫裤。特别增加了专供农民用的全开襟的卫生衫，和工人、学生喜欢的翻领、圆领等式样的卫生衫。
    “孔雀开屏”花布的新改进
    八月初，上海申新六厂接到一封建议信，信中说，“孔雀开屏”花布的确美丽可爱，可惜有个缺点，做被面时两幅边上的孔雀拼来拼去拼不成整只。如能使孔雀图案拼得拢，那就更好了。该厂印染部工人和技术员们，觉得这个意见很对。于是雕刻、调色、印花机上的技术员们都展开了热烈讨论，经过细心研究，决定先把布的宽度量好，然后把当中的三只孔雀图案稍稍靠拢点，使得布的两面边上刚好印上半只孔雀花，这样拼起来就能成一整只孔雀开屏图案了。八月底前作好了准备工作，九月一日已开始印花。印花工人说：我们要把花布的颜色印得鲜艳、美丽，使消费者称心如意。
    供应多种多样的冬装
    中国百货公司长春市公司，接受了往年棉装供应不及时造成的“先脱销、后积压”的教训，今年在第三季度初，就到机关、工厂了解职工对冬装、鞋帽样式、规格、颜色的意见，积极组织加工原料，并举办了冬货样品展览会，广泛征求了群众意见。八月下旬又邀请各百货商店和合作社营业员参观样品，征求意见。到九月上旬初步加工的棉干部服、呢裤子、棉皮鞋、皮帽子等八十多种冬货样品，都能尽量作到多样化，仅棉干部服一项，就有男女穿的拉锁式的、暗扣的、带皮领的三十多种。现在棉干部服已按计划加工出半数以上，又加工各种棉鞋两千多双，质量规格都比较好，已和顾客见面了。
    秋冬衣着运到了工地
    沈阳市各基本建设工地服务部，已将秋冬季用品源源送到工地。这些货物有很多都是按着建筑工人生产和生活的特点加工的。其中有各种服装和钉子扎不透的轻软厚布底鞋，以及可抵挡水泥浸渍的长统胶底鞋。南湖工地服务部里，摆满了来自全国各地的优美商品，营业员们耐心地接应着顾客，因此，八月下旬这个服务部的顾客已比一个月前加多了一倍。
    签订取暖煤炭供应合同
    吉林省各地煤业建筑器材商店，已分别与当地机关、企业、团体签订了取暖煤炭供应合同。按照合同规定，购买单位可在第三季度里把全部冬季用煤取完。这样到了冬天，就可集中力量来供应一般居民的需要，不致有站队买煤和应接不暇的现象。现在，各地机关、企业向煤业建筑器材商店，订购取暖煤的总量已达十七万吨，很多单位已开始提运。
    把绒衣、毛线、棉花拨到各地去
    哈尔滨地区百货批发站已把该地区内城乡人民需要的秋冬物资大部准备好了。各式棉皮鞋、皮帽子、棉大衣等加工原料已拨到加工厂开始加工；从东北和关内各地采购的毛线、绒衣、棉衣、棉胶鞋等也陆续运到，及时拨给各市县百货公司。八月初到八月二十日，就拨出三火车绒衣和一万九千多磅毛线。成批的棉花也拨到各地。
    现在，他们正在一面抓紧采购某些不足的冬货；一面组织加工厂改进加工品种、样式，把种类多，质量好的秋冬物资供应给城乡人民。
    福建省百货公司扩大经营品种满足人民需要
    中国百货公司福建省公司，为了充分供应城乡人民的秋冬季用品，全省百货公司系统的下半年商品流转计划比原订计划扩大了百分之三十，经营品种也由两千一百多种增加到三千五百多种。新增加的有罐头食品、文具、童装、鞋帽、玩具等，这些都是过去没有经营或很少经营过的商品。福州百货商店为满足城市和市郊工农群众以及居民、学生的需要，还准备继续扩大经营品种至五千多种。
