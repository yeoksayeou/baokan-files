Xinhua News Agency commentator Jiang Nan comments on a trick in American diplomacy: In recent days, the results of the recently concluded United Nations General Assembly meeting continue to be a central topic of commentary in newspapers around the world. Many newspapers in Western Europe and Asian countries have expressed indignation at the domineering attitude of the United States in this UN General Assembly, and are also dissatisfied with the striking fact that the representatives of the Syngman Rhee group, with American indulgence, openly threatened other countries at this UN General Assembly meeting not to support India's participation in the political conference. For example, the British "Sunday Times" wrote on August 30: Syngman Rhee is obviously not a "friend of peace," "It's ridiculous that this small and stubborn tail is wagging the American dog."

At this United Nations General Assembly meeting, the United States brought Syngman Rhee's so-called "Minister of Foreign Affairs" Byun Yung-tae into the meeting hall of the United Nations General Assembly and staged a ventriloquist act. First, this Byun Yung-tae delivered a speech at the General Assembly, violently scolding India and threatening that if India participated in the political conference, the Syngman Rhee group would withdraw. Then, U.S. Representative Lodge said at the General Assembly that, in view of South Korea's attitude, "India's participation would undermine the success of the conference." Then, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles publicly stated his opposition to India's participation in the conference. The United States relied on such methods and other behind-the-scenes activities to put pressure on its "allies" and unreasonably prevent the United Nations General Assembly from passing the recommendation regarding India's participation in the political conference.

The reason why the United States arranged such a ventriloquist act of letting the Syngman Rhee group shout first and then the United States declare its support is obviously a trick of the United States, forcibly dressing up the Syngman Rhee dog as a beast to intimidate the United States' "allies," attempting to create the impression that the United States has no choice but to cater to Syngman Rhee, and the United States' "allies" have no choice but to accommodate Syngman Rhee. However, this trick is obviously not clever. Apart from ancient myths, a house dog can never become a beast, and a tail cannot wag a dog after all. Everyone knows that the Syngman Rhee group relies on American dollars and bayonets to maintain its rule. Without American support, the Syngman Rhee group's rule could not last even a day. Therefore, the reason why the Syngman Rhee group dares to be so arrogant is naturally the result of the support and instigation of the American reactionary group behind the scenes. In fact, the United States is now using Syngman Rhee as a pistol to oppress its "allies" to accept the will of the United States. At this United Nations General Assembly, the United States used this pistol to point at its "allies," forcing them to accept the unreasonable proposition of turning the political conference into negotiations between the belligerent parties.

In fact, this trick of American diplomacy is not a new trick. The United States used it before the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. After the armistice agreement was signed, amid the Syngman Rhee group's clamoring, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Syngman Rhee held talks and secretly formulated a plan to manipulate and sabotage the upcoming political conference. Later, U.S. officials said with great fanfare that the United States must implement this plan, and the United States' "allies" must accept this plan.

Signs indicate that the United States will continue to use this trick in the future during the preparation for and holding of the political conference, using Syngman Rhee to oppress the United States' "allies," in order to facilitate the United States' domineering manipulation of the political conference and obliterate the opinions of its "allies," and to realize the United States' conspiracy to prevent a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and maintain the tense situation in the Far East.

### 新华社评论员评美国外交中的一条诡

    新华社评论员评美国外交中的一条诡计
    【新华社二日讯】新华社评论员江南评美国外交中的一条诡计说：这几天来，刚闭幕的联合国大会会议的结果继续是世界各国报纸评论的中心之一。西欧和亚洲国家许多报纸在评论中都对美国在这次联合国大会中的专横态度表示愤慨，并且都不满地谈到这样一个令人注目的事实，就是李承晚集团代表在美国纵容下竟然在这次联合国大会会议上公开恐吓其他国家不得支持印度参加政治会议。例如，英国“星期日泰晤士报”在八月三十日就写道：李承晚显然不是“和平之友”，“这个小而倔强的尾巴竟然摇起美国这条狗来了，这简直不像个样子”。
    在这次联合国大会会议上，美国把它的走狗李承晚的所谓“外务部长官”卞荣泰带进联合国大会的会议厅里，演出了一出双簧戏。起先是，这个卞荣泰在大会上发表了一篇破口谩骂印度的演说，并威胁说，如果印度参加政治会议，李承晚集团就要退出。接着是，美国代表洛奇在大会上说，鉴于南朝鲜的态度，“印度的参加会破坏会议的成功”。接着是，美国国务卿杜勒斯公开发表声明，反对印度参加会议。美国就是依靠这种手段及其他幕后活动，来对它的“盟国”施加压力，无理阻止联合国大会通过关于印度参加政治会议的建议。
    美国所以要安排这样一种让李承晚集团先叫嚣、然后美国声明支持的双簧戏，显然是美国的一条诡计，硬把李承晚这只走狗打扮成一头猛兽，来恫吓美国的“盟国”，企图造成这样一种印象，似乎是美国不得不迎合李承晚，美国的“盟国”也只好迁就李承晚。但是，这种诡计显然并不高明。除了古代神话以外，家狗终究不能变成猛兽，尾巴也毕竟无法摇狗。尽人皆知，李承晚集团是靠着美国的美元和刺刀才维持其统治地位的，没有美国的支持，李承晚集团的统治连一天都不能维持。因此，李承晚集团所以胆敢如此嚣张，自然是美国反动集团在背后支持和指使的结果。实际上，美国现在是把李承晚作为压迫美国“盟国”接受美国意志的一支手枪。在这次联合国大会上，美国就是用这支手枪来指向它的“盟国”，迫使它们接受把政治会议变成交战双方谈判的无理主张。
    其实，美国外交的这条诡计也并不是新鲜的花样，在朝鲜停战协定签订以前，美国就使用过了。在停战协定签订以后，在李承晚集团大肆叫嚣声中，美国国务卿杜勒斯和李承晚举行了会谈，秘密拟订了操纵和破坏即将举行的政治会议的计划。其后，美国官员就煞有介事地说，美国必须执行这个计划，美国的“盟国”必须接受这个计划。
    迹象说明，美国今后在准备政治会议和举行政治会议期间，必将继续使用这条诡计，利用李承晚来压迫美国的“盟国”，以便于美国专横地操纵政治会议而抹煞它的“盟国”的意见，实现美国阻止和平解决朝鲜问题、维持远东紧张局势的阴谋计划。
