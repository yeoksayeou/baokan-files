The first stage of the repatriation of prisoners of war (POWs) following the Korean armistice has concluded. POWs not directly repatriated have now begun to be transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The Chinese and Korean side, adhering to the armistice agreement, has completed the repatriation of all U.S. POWs who insisted on repatriation in the first stage. However, the U.S. side still detains a portion of our captured personnel who should be directly repatriated, and has not provided a clear and responsible explanation to date. Apart from the people detained by the U.S. side, tens of thousands of POWs directly repatriated by both sides have returned to their homeland, which is gratifying to the parents of POWs of all countries and people around the world who long for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The situation of the exchange of POWs in the first stage at Panmunjom further vividly demonstrates the two drastically different policies of both sides towards POWs.

The POWs repatriated by the Chinese and Korean side were "rosy and healthy" (Reuters), wearing neat clothes. Almost everyone carried a small bag containing their belongings from the POW camps. Some even carried their musical instruments and religious prayer books. They happily waved goodbye to the Chinese and Korean escorts. An Associated Press reporter even admitted that some of the POWs "were reluctant to leave" because the Chinese and Korean side treated them "like friends." However, the Chinese and Korean captured personnel repatriated by the U.S. side were emaciated, weak, sick, and disabled, with as many as 4,579 requiring immediate hospitalization (including more than 1,300 who were repatriated by the U.S. as "healthy" POWs). Many of them suffered from serious lung diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and scabies due to the U.S. side's torment in their living conditions. More than 110 people suffered from mental illnesses due to damage to their nervous systems caused by the U.S. side's electric shocks, or due to other physical and mental persecutions. Many others suffered injuries and illnesses caused by the U.S. side's use of rifles, bayonets, gas bombs, sulfuric acid, wooden sticks, and other various tortures in the POW camps. More than 500 people have become permanently disabled. Four others died after returning to their homeland despite medical treatment due to excessive harm. Such a tragic scene could only be seen in the slave markets of ancient Rome and the Auschwitz concentration camps of Hitler.

The returning Chinese and Korean captured personnel angrily accused the U.S. side of its brutal crimes of torturing and killing POWs, and more comprehensively exposed the facts of the U.S. side's abuse and large-scale massacre of POWs in POW camps in Geoje Island, Busan, and other places. The cruelty of these facts far exceeded what had been heard before. Countless accusations from our captured personnel have more thoroughly exposed the U.S. side's lies of claiming to be "humanitarians" and "respecting the individual will of POWs."

The full exposure of the U.S. side's crimes of violating the Geneva Convention and abusing POWs is what the bloodstained executioners are extremely afraid of. In the past, although American and British news agencies and U.S. POW camp officials admitted some of their crimes, the U.S. government has always denied them in every possible way. In this repatriation of POWs, they tried even harder to cover them up. On the one hand, they detained a large number of our captured personnel who were most cruelly persecuted—that is, those they called "criminal POWs" (and only repatriated some of them after our side specifically requested repatriation), in an attempt to obliterate some of the evidence. On the other hand, they mobilized the entire U.S. propaganda machine to fabricate lies slandering our side for "abusing POWs," in an attempt to divert people's attention from their true atrocities of torturing and killing POWs. For this despicable purpose, they used fascist methods to prohibit the repatriated American POWs from speaking, and controlled news reports about their statements with "the strangest censorship regulations" (Associated Press). Some POWs were detained and lost their freedom. In addition, they did everything possible to obstruct and restrict the work of the International Red Cross personnel in visiting Chinese and Korean POWs in the U.S. POW camps in South Korea. However, no matter how hard they try to hide their bloody hands in all aspects, they can only make their crimes more obvious. Most of the American, British, and other POWs repatriated by our side, including Dean, the captured commander of the U.S. 24th Division, said that they received good treatment from our side in accordance with humanitarian principles and the provisions of the Geneva Convention. This formed a stark contrast with the atrocities of American torture and killing of POWs accused by our returning captured personnel.

The heinous crimes committed by the U.S. side against Chinese and Korean captured personnel are partly due to the brutal nature of the imperialist aggressors. Their purpose in invading Korea was to enslave the Korean people and then enslave the Chinese people, so the POWs who fell into their hands first became the objects of their abuse and destruction. On the other hand, the United States also adopted an unprecedentedly sinister policy in the Korean War, attempting to forcibly detain POWs to supplement the remnant forces of its running dogs Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. In order to achieve this goal, they used all kinds of coercion, abuse, and massacre to conduct so-called "screenings," forcing some of our captured personnel to express "unwillingness to return" or not dare to request repatriation.

The returning captured personnel of our side accused countless facts of the U.S. side's inhumane actions in detaining POWs. For example, in the 82nd POW camp on Geoje Island, more than 300 of our captured personnel were killed overnight in mid-March of last year for refusing "screening." In the 2nd POW camp in Busan, the U.S. side cut off the POWs' food supply for as long as nine days to force them to accept the so-called "screening." Kim Jin-won, a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army, had one of his eyes gouged out by the U.S. military with an iron hook. They held the bloody eye and asked him: "Do you still want to go back to North Korea?" People will forever remember how the American jackals in human skin "respected the individual will of POWs"!

The atrocities of the U.S. aggressors in forcibly detaining POWs have not stopped even now. Not only has there been no action to realize Clark's promise to "continue to work hard" to recover the more than 27,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army forcibly detained by the Syngman Rhee clique, but also a large number of our captured personnel who should be directly repatriated were detained in violation of the armistice agreement. The U.S. side still refuses to explain the 228 of them, even after our side repeatedly questioned them at the Military Armistice Commission meeting based on conclusive lists. On the contrary, they adopted the method of "the thief crying 'stop thief'" in an attempt to confuse right and wrong. The U.S. side fabricated a "list" on September 9, falsely claiming that our side still detained 3,100 U.S. POWs who had "not yet been repatriated." However, two days ago, on September 7, the U.S. Secretary of State himself first revealed the truth of this deception. Dulles admitted to reporters in Washington: "I don't know of any evidence that would prove that they (the Chinese and Korean side) are holding any American POWs." According to a United Press dispatch on the 7th, among the POWs that the U.S. side called "unrepatriated," even "dead souls" like George Davis were included. Everyone knows that this Davis, who was praised by the U.S. Air Force as a "jet ace pilot," was killed by Zhang Jihui, a hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force, on February 10 last year. The Korean and Chinese side had already announced it in the war report, but the U.S. side still listed him as "missing" and said that the Chinese and Korean side "detained" him! It can be seen from this to what extent the U.S. side is shameless and vulgar in order to cover up its guilt of detaining POWs.

More noteworthy is that the U.S. side is stepping up its plot to forcibly detain POWs in the second stage of repatriating POWs. The Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs have both sent more agents to infiltrate our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated, in an attempt to continue to control and coerce our captured personnel after the POWs are transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, so that they cannot express their desire to request repatriation, and to undermine our explanatory work. Since the beginning of August, the "CIE" and other intelligence agencies of the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo have openly dispatched agents in large numbers to POW camps to organize secret organizations such as "commando teams," "spy teams," and "suicide squads" to strengthen control over POWs, and to falsely claim in the name of POWs that the original organization of POWs cannot be disrupted during the period of custody in neutral countries, which is even more sufficient to prove that there are ulterior and despicable intentions. At the same time, the U.S. side forced our captured personnel to universally tattoo and inscribe characters, causing them to be covered in blood and all kinds of dirty and reactionary slogans, in an attempt to prevent them from returning to their homeland.

However, the desire of our captured personnel to return to their homeland will be expressed as long as there is an opportunity to express it without being threatened by agents. On the very first day that some of our captured personnel were handed over to the custody of the neutral countries, nine people immediately escaped the control of the U.S. agents and firmly demanded repatriation. On September 14, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army requested repatriation. On September 16, four more captured soldiers of the Korean People's Army requested repatriation. Moreover, even before our explanatory work has started, many of our captured personnel have revealed to the Indian troops of the neutral countries who are guarding the POWs the various facts that the U.S. agents have used violent means to coerce them. According to an officer of the Indian army guarding the POWs, an "astonishing" number of POWs who are not directly repatriated may decide to return to the Chinese and Korean side.

The issue in the future is still to defeat the various conspiracies of the U.S. side to forcibly detain POWs and ensure the implementation of the provisions of the armistice agreement on the repatriation of POWs. At the meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, Chief Commissioner Li Sang-cho, Lieutenant General, of the Korean and Chinese side, emphasized and reminded the other side: The Korean and Chinese side has never considered this incident to be over regarding the more than 27,000 captured personnel of our side who were forcibly detained by Syngman Rhee, whom Clark has repeatedly declared "efforts" to "recover," and the U.S. side must give an explanation; regarding the captured personnel of our side who should have been directly repatriated this time but were detained by the U.S. side, the United Nations Command cannot escape its serious responsibility at any time. The people of China and Korea fully support our solemn attitude and demands. At the same time, we believe that under the fair handling of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the repatriation rights of our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated can be realized, and the U.S. side's lie of so-called "unwilling to return" of our captured personnel will be further exposed.

    美国所谓战俘“不愿遣返”的谎言进一步被揭穿了
    李高
    朝鲜停战后遣返战俘工作的第一阶段已告结束；不直接遣返的战俘随之开始移交中立国遣返委员会了。中朝方面信守停战协定，在第一阶段中，已将所收容的一切坚持遣返的美方战俘全部遣返完毕；但美方还扣留了一部分应予直接遣返的我方被俘人员，迄今还没有作明白负责的交代。除了被美方扣留了这一部分人之外，双方直接遣返的战俘已有数万人重返祖国家园，这是各国战俘的父母以及全世界渴望和平解决朝鲜问题的人士所引为欣慰的。
    板门店第一阶段交换战俘的情况，进一步鲜明地显示了双方对待战俘的两种截然不同的政策。
    中朝方面所遣送的战俘们，“红润而健康”（路透社），穿着整齐的衣服。几乎每人手里提着一个小包，保藏着他们从战俘营带回的财物。有的人还抱着自己的乐器、带着自己的宗教祈祷书。他们愉快地和中朝方面的护送人员挥手告别。合众社记者也承认，战俘们因中朝方面待他们“像朋友一样”，有的“舍不得走”。但美方遣送的中朝被俘人员，却是瘦骨嶙峋，疲病残废，其中需要立即送医院治疗的病伤人员达四千五百七十九人之多（其中有一千三百多人是被美方当作“健康”战俘遣返的）。他们中许多人因受美方在生活上的折磨而患着严重的肺病、肠胃病和癣疥等疾病。一百一十多人因被美方的电刑损害了神经系统，或因受其他肉体上、精神上的迫害而患了精神病。许多人则是在战俘营中遭受美方的步枪、刺刀、毒气弹、硫酸、木棍以及其他种种酷刑拷打而造成的伤病。五百多人已成终身残废。还有四个人因受害过重，回到祖国后救治无效。这种惨酷情景，只有在古罗马的奴隶市场和希特勒的奥斯维辛集中营中才能看到的。
    归来的中朝被俘人员愤怒地控诉了美方虐杀战俘的残暴罪行，更全面地揭露了美方在巨济岛、釜山等处战俘营中虐待战俘和大规模屠杀战俘的事实，这些事实的惨酷程度远远超过前此所闻的不知多少倍。我方被俘人员的无数控诉，把美方口口声声自称“人道主义者”、“尊重战俘个人意志”的谎言，更彻底地揭穿了。
    美方违反日内瓦公约虐待战俘罪行的全面被揭露，是满身血腥的刽子手们所万分恐惧的。在过去，虽然美英通讯社和美方战俘营官员都承认了一些他们的这种罪行，但美国政府还是百般抵赖。在这次遣返战俘工作中，他们更加千方百计地企图加以掩盖。他们一方面把那些受迫害最残酷的我方被俘人员——即他们所称的“犯罪的战俘”大批地加以扣留（直到我方指名要求遣返之后才遣返了其中的一部分），企图湮灭一部分证据；一方面发动美国整个宣传机器，编造诬蔑我方“虐待战俘”的谎言，企图转移人们对他们真正虐杀战俘的暴行的注意力。为了这个卑鄙的目的，他们用法西斯办法禁止被遣返的美国战俘发言，并以“最奇怪的检查条例”（美联社语）控制有关他们的言论的新闻报道。有的战俘则被拘禁而失去了自由。另外，他们还百端阻挠、限制联合红十字会人员在南朝鲜美方战俘营中访问中朝被俘人员的工作。但是，尽管它们想从各方面来藏住自己的血手，却只有使得他们的罪行欲盖弥彰。大多数从我方遣返的美英等国战俘，包括被俘的美国第二十四师师长迪安在内，都说出了他们受到我方根据人道原则和日内瓦公约规定给予良好待遇的情况，这和归来的我方被俘人员所控诉的美国虐杀战俘的暴行，形成了强烈的对照。
    美方对中朝被俘人员犯下的这种滔天罪行，一方面是由于帝国主义侵略者所具有的残暴特性所造成的；他们侵略朝鲜的目的就是为了奴役朝鲜人民并进而奴役中国人民，因此落到他们手里的战俘就首先变成了他们虐待摧残的对象。另一方面，美国在侵朝战争中还采取了一种史无前例的罪恶政策，企图强迫扣留战俘来补充其走狗李承晚和蒋介石的残余兵力。为了达到这个目的，他们就使用种种胁迫、虐待和屠杀手段，进行所谓“甄别”，强迫一部分我方被俘人员表示“不愿遣返”或不敢要求遣返。
    归来的我方被俘人员控诉了无数件美方为扣留战俘而做出的惨绝人寰的事实。例如在巨济岛第八十二号战俘营，我方被俘人员因拒绝“甄别”，去年三月中旬一夜之间就被杀死了三百多人。在釜山第二战俘营，美方曾断绝战俘口粮供应达九天之久来强迫战俘接受所谓“甄别”。朝鲜人民军被俘人员金津元，被美军用铁钩子挖掉一只眼睛。他们拿着血淋淋的眼睛问他：“还要回北朝鲜去吗？”人们将永远记住，披着人皮的美国豺狼们是怎样地“尊重战俘个人意志”的！
    美国侵略者强迫扣留战俘的暴行直到现在也还没有停止。不仅美方纵容李承晚集团强制扣留的朝鲜人民军被俘人员二万七千余人，至今未见采取任何行动来实现克拉克“继续努力”加以追回的诺言，而且违反停战协定的规定，扣留了大批应予直接遣返的我方被俘人员。其中的二百二十八名，经我方在军事停战委员会会议上根据确凿名单一再提出质问，美方仍拒不交代。相反地，他们还采取“贼喊捉贼”的办法希图混淆黑白。美方在九月九日捏造了一份“名单”，诬称我方尚扣留了三千一百名美方战俘“尚未遣返”。可是两天前，即九月七日，美国国务卿自己就首先泄露了这个骗局的真相。杜勒斯在华盛顿向记者们承认：“我不知道有什么证据，足以证明他们（中朝方面）扣留着任何美国战俘。”据合众社七日电，在美方称为“未被遣返的战俘”中，竟把乔治·戴维斯这样的“死魂灵”也算在内了。大家知道，这个曾被美国空军捧为“喷气机王牌驾驶员”的戴维斯，在去年二月十日被中国人民志愿军空军英雄张积慧所击毙，朝中方面早就在战报中公布过，而美方现在还把他列名为“失踪”，还说是中朝方面把他“扣留”了哩！由此可见，美方为了掩饰自己扣留战俘的罪责，竟无耻下流到了什么地步。
    更值得注意的，是美方正在遣返战俘的第二阶段中加紧布置强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。李承晚和蒋介石匪帮都已增派特务混入不直接遣返的我方被俘人员中，企图在战俘移交中立国遣返委员会后继续控制和胁迫我方被俘人员，使他们不得表示要求遣返的意志，并破坏我方的解释工作。从八月初以来，东京美军总部的“CIE”等特务机关公然大批地派遣特务到战俘营中去组织“特工队”、“特务队”、
    “决死队”等秘密组织，以加强对战俘的控制，并假冒战俘名义要求在中立国看管期间，不能打乱战俘的原来编组，这就更足以证明其中有着不可告人的卑鄙意图。同时，美方强迫我方被俘人员普遍文身刺字，把他们残害得全身血迹斑斑，满身是各种肮脏反动的标记口号，企图使他们不敢回到祖国。
    但是我方被俘人员渴望返回祖国的意愿，只要能有表达的机会，不受特务的威胁，就会表达出来的。就在一部分我方被俘人员交给中立国看管的头一天，马上有九人逃出美方特务的控制，坚决要求遣返。九月十四日有一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员要求遣返。九月十六日又有四名朝鲜人民军被俘人员要求遣返。还有，我方的解释工作还没有开始，就已有许多我方被俘人员向看管的中立国印度部队人员揭露美方特务用强暴手段胁迫他们的种种事实了。据看守战俘的印度军队的一位军官说，有“令人惊讶”的大量不直接遣返的战俘可能决定要回到朝中方面来。
    今后的问题仍然是必须击败美方强迫扣留战俘的各种阴谋，保证停战协定关于遣返战俘的规定的实施。在朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将曾强调提醒对方：对于克拉克一再声明“努力”“追回”的被李承晚强制扣留了的二万七千余名我方被俘人员，朝中方面绝未认为此次事件已告结束，美方必须作出交代；对于这次应该直接遣返而被美方扣留了的我方被俘人员，联合国军方面在任何时候都不能逃脱它所应负的严重责任。中朝两国人民完全支持我方这个严正的态度和要求。同时，我们相信，在中立国遣返委员会的公正处理下，不直接遣返的我方被俘人员的遣返权利，是可以实现的，美方的所谓我方被俘人员“不愿遣返”的谎言将被进一步揭穿。
