    Good Crop Growth in Yunnan
    This year, crops in various parts of Yunnan Province are generally growing well. Corn in the mountainous areas and rice in the plains are growing lushly. Currently, rice in the inland areas has begun to bud and head, while early rice in the southern border areas has already been harvested, achieving a bumper harvest. In cotton-producing areas such as Binchuan, cotton picking has begun. Based on the experience of Yuanjiang County in harvesting early rice and combined with the specific conditions of the area, Mengzi Special District has inspected and supplemented various agricultural tools needed for the autumn harvest. In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of the autumn harvest and planting work, Simao Special District has strengthened production offices at all levels and is being led by the Party Committee Secretary. Counties such as Pu'er have also convened representatives of iron, wood, and bamboo handicraft industries to mobilize them to produce agricultural tools to serve the autumn harvest.
    Hunting Harmful Beasts to Protect Crops
    Under the leadership of the People's Government and the People's Armed Forces Department, people in Guizhou, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Yunnan and other places are actively hunting wild animals to reduce disasters and protect the autumn harvest. In Weining County, Guizhou Province, with the militia as the backbone, the broad masses of the local people launched a "beast-fighting to protect seedlings" campaign. Within a month, they killed nine tigers, nine leopards, nine hundred and twenty-seven yellow muntjacs and rock goats, more than eighty wild boars, foxes, porcupines, badgers, wolves, etc., and more than one hundred rabbits, wild cats, mountain rats, badgers and wild dogs. Since the end of July, farmers in Lueyang County, Shaanxi Province, have been closely combining with autumn field management and actively organizing to encircle wild boars. According to incomplete statistics, more than 320 wild boars have been killed in thirteen days, initially changing the phenomenon of wild boars seriously damaging crops in previous years.
    The militia in the Yuebei area of Guangdong Province collectively captured and annihilated fourteen tigers, two leopards, six hundred and fifty-six wild boars, and seven wild cattle, and were commended by the Central South Military Region. Under the leadership of the People's Government, people in thirty-four counties including Yuxi and Pu'er in Yunnan Province have also captured a large number of wild animals.
    Repairing Farm Tools to Welcome the Autumn Harvest
    Farmers on both sides of the Yangtze River in Anhui Province are actively repairing and adding farm tools to welcome the autumn harvest. As of now, Guanfeng Township, Eling District, Nanling County, has oiled 164 grain containers, sorted out 194 loads of rice baskets, 158 manure baskets, and 42 reed mats. Peng Yushan Mutual Aid Team in the 14th district has oiled six grain containers. According to the calculation of labor force and farmland, the whole team only needs three, and the remaining three are prepared to be used by groups and households lacking containers under the principle of equivalent exchange. Puhe Village, Fen Shui Township, Wuwei County, sent representatives to Huangfu in Jiangnan to purchase rice forks (for raking rice). The Gao Chongjun Mutual Aid Team in Tishu Township not only repaired the original five boats, but also bought a new one.
    In order to do a good job in autumn harvesting in a planned way, while sorting out and adding agricultural tools, many state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams have also formulated autumn harvest plans and made appropriate adjustments to labor and agricultural tools to ensure timely harvesting so that the rice does not germinate and the grass does not rot.
    Overcoming Floods and Protecting Autumn Crops
    Since August, Henan has experienced continuous rainfall, and all rivers have risen at the same time. Dozens of dangerous points have occurred successively in Bo'ai, Zhongmu, Fengqiu, Dongming and other counties, resulting in a tense situation in some areas of the Yellow River and along the entire Qin River. The broad masses of people and flood control troops in the counties along the river went to the embankment overnight in the rain to engage in the intense battle of flood control and rescue. In this flood control effort, the commanders and fighters of the flood control troops took the lead in going into the water to rescue dangerous points regardless of hardships. Together with the broad masses of people, after three days and nights of intense work, they blocked more than 80 series of ditches and protected more than 100,000 mu of autumn crops that were about to be harvested from being flooded. The masses along the river who overcame the threat of this flood are now continuing to control floods while also entering the autumn harvest.
    Organizing Medical Personnel to Go to the Countryside to Serve Farmers
    Various parts of Hunan Province have generally begun to harvest mid-season rice. Harvesting in the lake area began after August 10 and will be basically completed by the end of the month. Although the maturity period of mid-season rice in mountainous and hilly areas is relatively late, some counties in the Qianyang Special District will also begin harvesting. In the plain areas of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the harvesting of mid-season rice has entered a climax.
    Because the weather this year is extremely hot, in order to protect the health of farmers, various places have organized health cadres from hospitals and health centers, as well as a large number of doctors of Chinese and Western medicine, to carry medicines to the countryside to conduct field rounds of medical assistance during the harvest season. For example, the health centers in Anxiang districts mobilized doctors of Chinese and Western medicine to go deep into the fields and organized medical teams to make rounds of diagnosis and treatment for farmers. Taoyuan dispatched twenty-five county and district health cadres, carrying emergency water and other medicines, to cooperate with one thousand and nine doctors to go to the fields for treatment, protecting the health of the masses and strongly supporting the autumn harvest work.
    Strengthening Autumn Harvest Leadership and Mastering Three Key Aspects
    Due to the leadership's grasp of three key aspects, Jianhu, Xinghua, Yancheng, Gaoyou, Fengxian, Chuansha, Nanhui and other counties in Jiangsu Province, as well as other areas where early, middle and late rice are interplanted, have completed the timely harvesting of 7.5 million mu of early rice fields, generally increasing production by 10% to 20% compared with last year. The first key aspect is that local Party committees and governments attach importance to the leadership of the autumn harvest, criticize and reverse the paralysis of some cadres and the masses, and focus on the autumn harvest in the autumn harvest areas. For example, before the autumn harvest, Xinghua County arranged for each district and township to convene various meetings one after another to discuss the issue of doing a good job in the autumn harvest. The Deputy Secretary of the Xinghua County Party Committee and responsible comrades of the County Party Committee personally went to the countryside to inspect and help with the work. Many areas have also implemented the policy of voluntary mutual benefit through convening mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings; further rectified and improved mutual aid teams, especially paying attention to the leadership of seasonal teams, and made organizational preparations for the autumn harvest work. The second key aspect is to fully prepare various aspects such as the site, tools, and labor force during the autumn harvest. Some areas lacking labor and cattle power, in addition to fully mobilizing women and rationally using the labor force, also organized external support as early as possible. For example, Jianhu County adjusted more than 2,850 male and female laborers and more than 750 cattle to other places during the autumn harvest. The third key aspect is that the mutual aid teams in various places have played the role of organization and have led individual farmers to do a good job in the autumn harvest. The mutual aid teams in various places that have the conditions have formulated autumn harvest and autumn planting (cultivation) plans, and general mutual aid teams have also arranged various tasks in the autumn harvest, rationally using labor and agricultural tools, and developing production potential on the basis of the original manpower and agricultural tools.

    在秋收的季节里
    云南庄稼成长良好
    云南省各地今年庄稼一般都成长良好，各地山区的包谷、平坝的水稻都长得肥旺。目前内地各地区的水稻已开始打苞、出穗，南部边疆各地的早稻业已收割，并获得了丰收，宾川等产棉区棉花已开始收摘。蒙自专区根据元江县收割早稻的经验结合该区具体情况，进行了检查与添补秋收所需的各种农具。思茅专区为了加强对秋收与秋种工作的组织领导，已加强各级生产办公室，并由党委书记亲自掌握领导。普洱等县还召开了铁、木、篾手工业代表会，发动他们制作农具为秋收服务。
    捕打害兽，保护禾苗
    贵州、陕西、广东、云南等地人民在人民政府和人民武装部的领导下，积极捕打野兽，减少灾害、保卫秋收。贵州威宁县以民兵为骨干，动员当地广大群众展开了“打兽保苗”的斗争，只在一个月内就打死老虎九只、豹子九只、黄麂岩羊九百二十七只、野猪、狐狸、刺猪、滚猪、狼等八十多只，兔子、野猫、山耗子、巩猪、野狗共一百余只；陕西略阳县农民从七月底起，紧密结合秋田管理，积极组织起来，开始围剿野猪。根据不完全统计，十三天就已经打死野猪三百二十多条。初步改变了历年来野猪严重糟害庄稼的现象。
    广东省粤北地区民兵共捕歼老虎十四只、豹子二只、山猪六百五十六只，山牛七头，受到了中南军区的通报嘉奖。云南玉溪、普洱等三十四个县的人民，在人民政府领导下，也捕获了大批野兽。
    修补农具迎接秋收
    安徽省长江两岸农民，积极修补与添置农具，迎接秋收。南陵县峨岭区官峰乡到目前止，已油好斛桶一百六十四张，整理稻箩一百九十四担，粪箕一百五十八只，簟垫四十二床。十四选区彭玉山互助组已油好六张斛桶。按照劳动力、田亩计算，全组只需三张，其余三张准备在等价交换的原则下给缺桶的组、户使用。无为县芬水乡蒲河一村，推出代表到江南黄府购稻?子（?稻禾用）。提树乡高崇军互助组除修补了原有的五只船外，并公买了一只新船。
    为了有计划地做好秋收工作，在整理添置农具同时，很多国营农场、农业生产合作社、互助组，还订出秋收计划，将劳动力、农具，进行适当的调整，保证及时收割，做到稻子不芽，草不烂。
    战胜洪水，保住秋禾
    八月以来，河南连续降雨，各条河流同时涨水。博爱、中牟、封邱、东明等县，先后发生险工数十处之多，造成黄河个别地区吃紧、沁河全线紧张形势。沿河各县广大群众及防汛部队连夜冒雨上堤，投入防汛、抢险的紧张战斗。在这次防汛中，防汛部队的指战员们，不辞艰苦，带头下水，抢救险工。他们和广大群众在一起，经过三昼夜的紧张工作，堵塞了串沟八十多处，保卫了十余万亩丰收在望的秋禾未被水淹。战胜这次洪水威胁的沿河群众，现一面继续防汛，一面已进入了秋收。
    组织医务人员下乡为农民服务
    湖南省各地已普遍开始收割中稻。滨湖区八月十日以后开始收割，月底就可基本完成。山区、丘陵区中稻的成熟期虽较迟，但黔阳专区部分县也将开始收割；湘西苗族自治区的平原地带，中稻收割已进入高潮。
    因为今年天气酷热，为了保护农民健康，各地在收割期中都纷纷组织卫生院、卫生所的卫生干部，及大批中西医生，携带药品下乡，进行田间巡回医救工作。如安乡各区卫生所发动中西医生深入田间，组织医疗组巡回替农民诊病。桃源抽出县区卫生干部二十五人，携带救急水等药品，配合一千零九个医生分赴田间进行医治，保护了群众的身体健康，有力地支持了秋收工作。
    加强秋收领导，掌握三个环节
    江苏省建湖、兴化、盐城、高邮、奉贤、川沙、南汇等县及其他早中晚稻夹种地区由于领导上掌握了三个环节，七百五十万亩早稻田已及时收割完毕，一般比去年增产一成到二成左右。第一个环节是各地党委和政府重视对秋收的领导，批判与扭转了部分干部和群众的麻痹思想，在秋收地区以秋收工作为中心。如兴化县在秋收前，就布置各区、乡先后召开各种会议讨论做好秋收工作的问题。中共兴化县委副书记及县委各负责同志并亲自下乡检查与帮助工作。不少地区还通过召开互助合作代表会，贯彻了自愿互利政策；进一步整顿和提高了互助组，特别是重视对季节性组的领导，为秋收工作做好了组织准备。第二个环节是充分做好秋收中的场地、工具、劳力等各种准备工作。有些地区劳力、牛力不够，除充分发动妇女和合理使用劳动力外，也及早的组织了外力支援。如建湖县在秋收中就向外地调剂了二千八百五十多名男女劳动力，七百五十多头黄牛。第三个环节是各地互助组发挥了组织起来的作用，并带动单干农民做好了秋收工作。各地有条件的互助组都订立了秋收秋种（耕）计划，一般互助组也把秋收中的各项工作进行了安排，合理的使用劳力、农具，在原有的人力农具的基础上，发挥了生产上的潜力。
