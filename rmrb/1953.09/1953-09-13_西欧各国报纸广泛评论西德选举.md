Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch: According to TASS, newspapers in Western European countries have widely commented on the results of the West German elections. Various newspapers pointed out the anti-democratic nature of the election and noted that the election results have increased the danger of war in Western Europe. Many newspapers called for intensifying the struggle for peace.
    The British "Daily Worker" commented: Adenauer and Dulles are using the election results to accelerate military preparations and intensify the implementation of the plan to establish a West German army. Adenauer's victory is an alarm foretelling the revival of German militarism.
    Many bourgeois newspapers in Britain are uneasy about Adenauer's revanchism and the plans of Bonn and Washington in the future. Sefton Delmer, the "Daily Express" correspondent in Berlin, pointed out in a dispatch that German capitalists who supported Adenauer "supported his election campaign with a total of 1.5 million pounds." Delmer said that these capitalists believe that as long as Adenauer starts building an army, he will get a lot of dollars, weapons and equipment. Delmer wrote: "It is speculated that new steps will be taken in this regard in the near future. First, the German Federal Parliament will pass the European Defense Treaty. Second, the United States will put pressure on France to approve this treaty immediately without delay." The "Daily Express" wrote in an editorial: "When Germany reappears on the political stage, you can hear the sound of military boots. If anyone thinks that Germany will be satisfied with a European army in which its soldiers only play a second-rate role, then he is wrong..." The "Times" also predicted that "Washington will put pressure on Paris to get France to ratify the agreement on the European Defense Community." The "Evening Standard" published a letter from Shinwell, one of the leaders of the British Labour Party and former Minister of Defence, which stated that the West German election results are a threat to European peace.
    Many bourgeois newspapers in France also expressed concern about the West German election results. Pierre André, a member of the Independent Republican Party of the French National Assembly, published a statement in "Le Monde." He pointed out: "Obviously, we will soon hear people talk about the European Army and the European Defense Community again. If the parliaments of Western countries approve the shocking Treaty of Paris and guarantee Germany's leading position in Western Europe, then Germany's military leadership will lead us to war. It should be hoped that France will not forget the lessons of history in the past 30 years. For our diplomacy, it is now more necessary than ever to maintain vigilance and prudence if our diplomacy intends to defend peace."
    French democratic newspapers called on the broad masses of people to carry out a more resolute struggle against the deadly policies that may make West German revanchists even more rampant. Ma Flier wrote in "Liberation": "Undeniably, the United States is encouraging Adenauer and supporting German militarists. In order to implement its Cold War policy against the East, the United States needs a West Germany that is strong militarily and economically... At this moment when West Germany is about to be armed, France is facing the same dangers as in 1914 and 1939. No French person wants to suffer the same danger again." Commenting on the French officials' position of expressing "great satisfaction" with the reactionary wave in West Germany, the newspaper said: "The German elections and Adenauer's remarks are an alarm. France's national security requires us to continue the struggle against arming Germany. We must rise up to defend peace, defend France, and oppose Bonn provocateurs. This is clear to everyone. Undoubtedly, this requires another kind of government, not a government that expresses 'great satisfaction'." Pierre Gudaad pointed out in "L'Humanité": The West German election results mean that "the worst German nationalists and revanchist groups are in power." "This situation contains a serious danger to peace in Europe and the world. French security is already facing a direct threat." Gudaad wrote: "The French people who have not forgotten the lessons of recent history are uniting to protest this sinful policy."
    The Dutch "Truth Daily" said in a commentary, "Adenauer's party used an election system that distorted democracy and simply deprived parties that received less than 5% of the total votes of their seats in parliament... Intimidation, lies, terror, incitement, the support of the occupiers, the money of the big arms manufacturers—these are the methods and means by which Adenauer obtained votes.”
    Commenting on the West German election results, the Danish "Land and People's Daily" pointed out that terror and violence affected the election results. It emphasized that the results of the Federal Parliament elections produced the threat of West Germany "accelerating militarization and Nazification." The newspaper said: "The threat from the south, the threat of German militarism to Denmark and to all of Europe, is about to become a reality again. Denmark should be vigilant about the future development of the West German events."
    The Swedish "Morning News" expressed unease about Adenauer's speech intimidating the German Democratic Republic. The newspaper said that in Adenauer's speech, we heard the sound of the German army advancing again.
    The Swiss "Advance News" editorial wrote: "There is no freedom or democracy to speak of in the Federal Parliament election." "Advance News" went on to say that Dulles and Adenauer hoped to turn West Germany into a source of new aggression by instigating riots like the one on June 17. The newspaper pointed out that the so-called "unified Europe" and the policy of arming West Germany are also a threat to Switzerland. "Advance News" called for intensifying the struggle for peace and increasing vigilance against the conspiracies of the enemies of peace.

### 西欧各国报纸广泛评论西德选举

    西欧各国报纸广泛评论西德选举
   【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社讯：西欧各国报纸普遍评论西德选举的结果。各种报纸都指出这次选举的反民主的性质，并指出选举的结果已使西欧战争的危险增加。许多报纸号召加紧争取和平的斗争。
    英国“工人日报”的评论写道：阿登纳和杜勒斯利用选举结果来加速进行军事准备和加紧实现建立西德军队的计划。阿登纳的胜利就是预告着德国军国主义复活的一个警报。
    英国许多资产阶级报纸对阿登纳的复仇主义和今后波恩与华盛顿的那些计划感到不安。“每日快报”驻柏林记者塞夫顿·德尔麦在一篇通讯中指出，拥护阿登纳的德国大资本家“以总数达一百五十万英镑的巨款来支持他的竞选活动”。德尔麦说道：这些资本家认为，只要阿登纳一着手建立军队，它就能得到大量的美元、武器和装备。德尔麦写道：“据推测，最近期间在这一方面就要采取新的步骤。第一，德国联邦议院要通过欧洲防御条约。第二，美国要对法国施行压力，要它立即批准这一条约，不再拖延。”“每日快报”在社论中写道：“当德国重新出现在政治舞台上的时候，你就能听到军靴发出橐橐之声。如果有人认为，德国会以他的士兵仅充当二流角色的这样一个欧洲军为满足，那他的想法就错了……”“泰晤士报”也预言，“华盛顿要对巴黎加施压力，使法国批准关于欧洲防务集团的协定”。“标准晚报”刊载了英国工党领袖之一，前国防大臣辛威尔的来信，信中说道，西德选举结果对欧洲和平是一种威胁。
    法国许多资产阶级报纸对西德选举结果也表示忧虑。法国国民议会独立共和党议员皮埃尔·安德烈在“新闻报”上发表了一项声明。他指出：“显然，我们很快又会听到人说欧洲军和欧洲防务集团了。假使西方各国的议会一旦批准骇人听闻的巴黎条约，并保证德国在西欧的领导地位，那么德国的军事领导权就会把我们引向战争。应当希望，法国不会忘记近三十年来历史的教训。对于我们的外交说来，现在比过去任何时候都更加需要保持警惕和谨慎，如果我们的外交是打算保卫和平的话。”
    法国民主报纸号召广大人民群众更加坚决地进行斗争，反对可能使西德复仇主义分子更加猖狂的致命政策。马·福里埃在“解放报”上写道：“无可辩驳的，美国在给阿登纳打气，给德国军国主义者撑腰。美国为了执行它对付东方的冷战政策，需要一个在军事和经济上强大的西德……在这个西德将要被武装起来的时刻，法国又面临着像一九一四年和一九三九年那样的危险。没有一个法国人愿意再遭受同样的危险。”该报在评论法国官方人士对西德的反动浪潮表示“十分满意”的立场时说：“德国选举和阿登纳的言论是一个警报。法国的民族安全要求我们继续进行反对武装德国的斗争。必须起来保卫和平，保卫法国，反对波恩挑拨者。这一点是每个人都明白的。无容置疑，为此就需要另外一种政府，而不需要一个表示‘十分满意’的政府。”皮埃尔·古达德在“人道报”上着重指出：西德选举结果意味着“德国最坏的民族主义者和复仇主义者集团掌握政权”。“这种局势蕴藏着对欧洲和全世界和平的严重危险。法国安全已经面临直接的威胁。”古达德写道：“没有忘记不久前历史教训的法国人民正在团结起来一致抗议这种罪恶的政策。”
    荷兰“真理报”在一篇评论中说，“阿登纳的党利用了曲解民主的选举制度，干脆剥夺了得票不到总票数百分之五的党派在议会中的席位……威吓、撒谎、恐怖、煽动、占领者的支持、大军火制造商的钱——这些就是阿登纳赖以获得选票的方法和手段。”
    丹麦“国土与人民报”评论西德选举结果时指出，恐怖和暴力影响了选举的结果。它着重说，联邦议院的选举结果产生了西德“加速军国主义化和纳粹化的威胁”。该报说：“从南面来的威胁、德国军国主义对丹麦和对全欧洲的威胁又要成为现实的事了。丹麦应当警戒西德事件的未来的发展。”
    瑞典“晨报”对阿登纳威吓德意志民主共和国的演说表示不安。该报说，在阿登纳的演说中，我们又听到了德国军队前进的声音。
    瑞士“前进报”社论写道：“联邦议院的选举根本谈不到什么自由、民主。”“前进报”接着说，杜勒斯和阿登纳希望通过策动像六月十七日那样的骚乱，把西德变成新侵略的策源地。该报指出，所谓“统一欧洲”和武装西德的政策对瑞士也是一个威胁。“前进报”号召加紧进行争取和平的斗争，并对和平敌人的阴谋提高警惕。
