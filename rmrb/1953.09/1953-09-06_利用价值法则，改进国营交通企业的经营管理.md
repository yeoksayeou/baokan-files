Utilizing the Law of Value to Improve the Operation and Management of State-Owned Transportation Enterprises
Sun Dagang, Director of the Planning Department of the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government

I.

Comrade Stalin pointed out in "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" that although the law of value does not have a regulatory effect in socialist production, it still influences production because the consumer goods necessary to compensate for the labor force expended in the production process are still produced and sold as commodities subject to the law of value. It is precisely here that the influence of the law of value on production can be seen. Therefore, economic accounting and profitability issues, cost issues, pricing issues, etc., in socialist enterprises have practical significance. Socialist enterprises cannot but consider the law of value.

In New China, commodity production is carried out on a broader scale, and the law of value has a greater role. Socialist state-owned enterprises need to appropriately solve problems such as economic accounting, profitability, cost, and pricing, and need to consider the law of value. State-owned transportation enterprises are naturally no exception.

How does the law of value affect state-owned transportation enterprises? First, it requires each transportation enterprise to organize reasonable transportation and conduct detailed accounting based on the characteristics of its transportation tools and production conditions; to discover and fully utilize the internal potential of the enterprise, continuously reduce costs, carry out the most efficient transportation at the most economical price, and increase accumulation for the country.

It cannot be said that our transportation enterprises have well understood the role of the law of value and estimated them in their own accounting, and used them for the benefit of society.

Why are there still some chaotic phenomena in pricing policies? Why are there so many non-production personnel in each enterprise? Why do our ships have such long non-production berthing times in ports? Why can't we learn from advanced Soviet experiences and promote advanced experiences among workers? Not making good use of the law of value is one of the main reasons.

Therefore, recognizing the role of the law of value in state-owned transportation enterprises and using this law to improve our operation and management of enterprises is a very important thing. As Comrade Stalin said, "This is a good practical school, which accelerates the growth of our economic work cadres and accelerates their transformation into real socialist production leaders at the current stage of development." [1] We should make it a reality in our work.

II.

One of the general requirements of the law of value is to attach importance to the labor expenditure in production. Therefore, the increase of labor productivity is an important condition for the development of production.

At present, the main efforts to improve labor productivity in enterprises under the Ministry of Transportation should be: (1) fully utilize the potential capacity of existing equipment and better mobilize and organize various transportation tools; (2) encourage invention and creation, and learn from advanced Soviet experience; (3) improve labor organization and operating methods, and improve the work efficiency of each transportation worker.

It should be pointed out that we are not doing a satisfactory job in improving labor productivity. On the one hand, we are counting on the state to order a large number of machine tools from abroad, but on the other hand, we are abandoning a large number of machine tools. In shipbuilding, on the one hand, some ships cannot be well repaired, and on the other hand, shipyards do not have enough production tasks; in waterway transportation, on the one hand, the problem of port workers waiting for work is serious, and on the other hand, the non-production berthing time of ships in ports is very long; learning from Soviet experience is still very unsystematic, and there are still many obstacles. Some navigation leading agencies were lax after promoting the one-column towing method in inland rivers, and the pilot work of advanced voyages at sea has not been well summarized, which are all good examples. Workers' inventions and creations are still subjected to bureaucratic indifference and have not been systematically summarized and promoted; and backwardness in labor organization is even more obvious: the structure of many of our enterprises is unsound, there are no production scheduling organizations, there are no or no emphasis on technical operating procedures, the responsibility system has not been universally established, and the most serious thing is that a large number of surplus labor has not been resolved for a long time, and patriotic production competitions are also extremely infrequent or often reduced to formalities.

Comrade Malenkov said: "Technical norms are of great significance in improving labor productivity." [2] Many of our enterprises have not yet implemented quota management, and the quotas of some enterprises are still mostly experimental statistical quotas. As for the average advanced quotas, if there are any, I am afraid they are very few. Low quotas cannot stimulate the growth of labor productivity, and without quota management, there can be no cost accounting and planning management.

The biggest enemies of improving labor productivity are conservatism and treating enterprise management with a bureaucratic attitude. Conservatives cannot see the potential factors and are unwilling to examine the problem from a developmental perspective. Bureaucrats are only satisfied with principle leadership and vested achievements. Whether it is conservatism or bureaucracy, they are unwilling to systematically and practically study the instructions of the higher authorities and the advanced experiences that have been implemented in other enterprises with remarkable results to improve their work. They think that low work efficiency is natural; they even think that it is not necessary to conduct in-depth and detailed investigations and studies on the specific situations of each enterprise in a realistic manner, find the central link, and point out the direction of development, but as long as general instructions are given, things can be done well. Facts have proved that if conservative ideas and bureaucracy are not overcome, our enterprise management will not be able to move forward.

III.

Another requirement of the law of value is that every enterprise must have profits (of course, the issue of profits in our state-owned enterprises is fundamentally different from the issue of profits in capitalist enterprises), that is, to increase accumulation for the country, which requires us to strictly implement the system of economy.

The system of economy is the socialist method of operation, an important source of capital accumulation for state-owned enterprises, and is of decisive significance to national industrialization. We must fully and rationally utilize production resources and manage enterprises carefully and meticulously in order to better develop our economy.

It should be said that the system of economy has not been well established in our transportation industry. This is mainly manifested in:

First, our costs are countless in our minds. When making financial plans, some enterprises always expect to lose a certain amount throughout the year, but at the end of the year, they have unexpected surpluses. The planned profit of an enterprise in the first quarter of 1953 was 600 million, while the actual profit was 6 billion, but the production plan was not completed. The serious problem is that this phenomenon is not accidental in enterprises under the Ministry of Transportation. With the cost management situation like this, it is not difficult to imagine the huge waste in raw materials, materials, fuel, tools, etc. Whether in transportation or capital construction, many units use the method of increasing consumption quotas and labor volume indicators to hide huge reserves in the cost plan. We can no longer tolerate this phenomenon to continue. The only way is to strengthen financial supervision over each enterprise, practically study the production conditions of each enterprise, take necessary measures to eliminate "ambushes," and ensure the cost is reduced step by step.

Second, Comrade Malenkov criticized the huge losses and non-productive expenditures in Soviet transportation enterprises, saying: "In many shipping and automobile transportation agencies, due to failure to complete the transportation plan, the downtime of carriages, ships, and automobiles is very long, and the amount of overspending and losses due to extra fuel consumption and many losses caused by poor management is huge." [3] Our situation is also like this. Taking the whole year of 1952 as an example, according to the statistics reported by various ports, the non-production berthing time of sea ships accounted for 58% of the total berthing time. According to the statistics for the first quarter of this year, the loading and unloading time only accounted for 16% of the total berthing time of ships under the Shanghai Dispatch Section of the Yangtze River, and the non-loading and unloading berthing time accounted for 84%; the waiting time of dock workers was also very serious. A certain port lost 49% of the total working hours in the first quarter of this year. It is already common for ship repairs to be delayed, and the high cost of ship repairs seriously affects the cost of transportation (according to statistics from a certain shipping bureau, ship repair costs account for 25% of the cost).

Third, the loss of goods caused in the transportation process is also alarming. Rice and flour are loaded onto ships, and rot during navigation either due to broken water pipes on the ship or due to poor loading and sealing of the cabin. During the loading and unloading process, bags are often broken, causing a large amount of loss. In ports, sometimes boxes of glass are broken, cars of soybeans germinate, and many iron pipes are bent when unloaded from ships. Although there is currently a lack of national statistics on this type of loss, the total amount is certainly alarming! But this has not aroused the attention of our leaders at all levels, and timely measures have not been taken to correct it.

Fourth, administrative expenses account for a large proportion of the financial plans of our enterprises and capital construction units. The management fees of individual enterprises are as high as 15%, and some enterprises and capital construction units do not even have a more accurate calculation of management fees. Many enterprises have a huge management structure. The normal staffing of a large ocean-going ship is 40 to 50 people, while the crew of our coastal small and medium-sized ships is as many as about 100 people.

As Comrade Malenkov pointed out: "Many leaders have forgotten the system of economy. They do not care about the rational and economical use of state funds. They have not given appropriate attention to the improvement of the financial and economic work of the enterprises and institutions they lead." This is very bad. "We must eradicate all phenomena of waste of materials, manpower, and financial resources, and ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the task of reducing product costs in a planned way." [4]

IV.

To improve the operation and management of our transportation enterprises and correct the serious shortcomings that are widespread in various enterprises, we must improve the leadership level of Party organizations in various enterprises.

The thinking of leaders at all levels in our transportation departments lags behind the requirements of the Party and the state and the consciousness of the masses. As long as you deeply understand the actual situation, you will find that some instructions of the Party and the government have not been implemented, many workers' creations have been buried, and the labor achievements of grassroots production units have been shelved in file folders and drawers. Party organizations in enterprises must pay attention to and check this bureaucratic phenomenon constantly and rely on the strength of the masses to launch an uncompromising struggle against bureaucratic phenomena.

First, we must launch self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism. In socialist state-owned enterprises, we must effectively raise the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to fight against all inert forces that hinder production development. The leading force of Party organizations should be manifested in: when a new thing is still in its infancy, it can be discovered and given enough support to develop and grow; when a new danger is also seen in its infancy in a timely manner, and does not allow it to develop into a threat. For the Party to be able to do this, it must be vigilant at all times, and carry out criticism in the competition to promote good factors and overcome bad factors. Comrade Stalin called socialist competition "a manifestation of the masses' realistic revolutionary self-criticism, which relies on the creative initiative of millions of working people." [5] He also revealed the contradictions that the Stakhanov movement had to overcome: "Obviously, this movement had to break through certain dikes. Someone hindered it, someone restricted it, and this Stakhanov movement, having accumulated elites, broke through these dikes and flooded the country." [6] It should be said that we have not done enough in mastering and using the weapon of criticism to break through certain old dikes. We are often satisfied with peaceful coexistence, and even we are blinded by certain inert forces, causing the development of transportation enterprises to be in a slow state, which is urgently needed to be overcome.

Second, we must strengthen discipline in various enterprises. Transportation enterprises are connected by points and lines, and require close cooperation and coordinated actions from various places in order to better complete tasks. It cannot be said that the coordination and cooperation between our various ports and ships, between stations and vehicles, and between vehicles and factories has been done very well; of course, this coordination is the responsibility of higher-level leaders, but the conscious and active cooperation between various production units also has the same major significance. Is it true that "there are still a few staff members who have forgotten that the enterprises entrusted to them to manage are state-owned enterprises, and they even attempt to turn these enterprises into their hereditary territories, where this leader - if he can still be called that - believes that he can do anything 'as he pleases'." [7] We have this here, and this phenomenon of not complying with unified plans and not cooperating with each other must be overcome. The task of Party organizations in transportation enterprises is to establish and maintain a high degree of organization and discipline. To safeguard the seriousness of state laws and ensure the completion of plans, we must wage an uncompromising struggle against all phenomena of violating laws and regulations and acting independently.

Third, we must correctly select cadres to improve the composition of our leading cadres. We should resolutely promote activists in production to leading positions and help them learn to do leadership work smoothly. The main conditions for selecting cadres can only be political quality and business ability. We must resolutely use outstanding, competent, advanced, and loyal people to lead our enterprises. We must never allow "some honest and business-savvy staff members to be squeezed out under various pretexts because they are unwilling to tolerate shortcomings and make the leaders uncomfortable." [8] Party organizations must discover, help, train, and promote activists in production to leading positions through inspection work to replace those complacent, conservative, and decadent bureaucrats.

Fourth, strengthen ideological work. Because economic work has a lot of administrative affairs and it is relatively easy to see results, therefore, among our leading cadres, there are quite a few people who are busy with administrative affairs all day long and start to be fascinated by the vested achievements, and slowly forget the great role of ideological work, and do not fully realize that every change in the international and domestic situation directly affects our production tasks; do not fully realize that China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society before liberation, and that the petty bourgeoisie still accounts for the majority of the population today, and all kinds of non-proletarian ideas are eroding us every day. Wherever ideological leadership is relaxed, fertile soil is created for the revival of hostile views and concepts. Comrade Malenkov pointed out: "Underestimating the importance of ideological work is to a large extent the result of some of our leading cadres failing to strive to improve their consciousness, enrich their knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, and absorb the historical experience of the Party. Without this, it is impossible to become a truly mature leader. A person who lags behind ideologically and politically, lives according to memorized formulas, and loses his sense of fresh things cannot correctly analyze the domestic and international situation, cannot and does not deserve to stand at the forefront of the movement, and sooner or later he will be abandoned by real life." [9] I think everyone who does leadership work should conduct a painful introspection based on this passage by Comrade Malenkov: have we lost our political sensitivity and the Bolshevik spirit of progress? Are we or will we degenerate into a short-sighted political mediocrity? It is worth noting that the Party organizations in many of our departments have failed to actively play a leading role ideologically. The Party organizations must promptly face up to this fact, go deep into the grassroots production units, mobilize the most active and most revolutionary forces in production, and ideologically remove the remnants of feudal and capitalist ideas, the prejudices and harmful traditions of the old society from people's minds, so as to be able to assume the responsibility of leading production.

    利用价值法则，改进国营交通企业的经营管理
    中央人民政府交通部计划司司长  孙大光
    一
    斯大林同志在“苏联社会主义经济问题”中指出，价值法则在社会主义生产中，虽然没有调节作用，可是它总还影响生产，因为抵偿生产过程中耗费的劳动力而必需的消费品，还是作为受价值法则支配的商品来生产和销售的，正是在这里可以看出价值法则对生产的影响。所以在社会主义企业里的经济核算和赢利问题，成本问题，价格问题等等，就具有现实意义。社会主义的企业就不能不考虑到价值法则。
    在新中国，商品生产在更广大的范围内进行，价值法则具有更大的作用，社会主义性质的国营企业更是需要适当解决经济核算、赢利、成本、价格等问题，更是需要考虑到价值法则。国营交通运输企业自然也不能例外。
    价值法则如何影响国营交通运输企业呢？它首先要求各运输企业根据自己底运输工具的特性和生产条件，组织合理的运输，进行精细的核算；发现和充分利用企业内部的潜在力量，不断地降低成本，以最经济的价格，进行效率最高的运输，并为国家增加积累。
    还不能说我们交通运输企业已经很好地认识了价值法则所发生的作用，并在自己底核算中估计到它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利了。
    为什么在价格政策上还存在一些混乱现象？为什么各企业里有那么多的非生产人员？为什么我们的船舶在港口有那么长的非生产停泊时间？为什么我们不能很好地学习苏联先进经验和推广工人中的先进经验？没有很好利用价值法则是其中的一个主要原因。
    因此，认识价值法则在国营交通运输企业中的作用，利用这一法则来改进我们对企业的经营和管理，是一件非常重要的事情。斯大林同志下面的一段话，“这是很好的实践的学校，它加速我们经济工作干部的成长，加速把他们变成现今发展阶段上真正的社会主义生产领导者。”〔一〕我们应该使它在工作中实现。
    二
    价值法则的一般要求之一是要重视生产中的劳动耗费。因此，劳动生产率的提高便是发展生产的重要条件。
    目前在交通部所属各企业中如何提高劳动生产率的问题，主要的努力方向应该是：（一）充分发挥现有设备的潜在能力，并把各种运输工具更好地动员起来组织起来；（二）鼓励发明和创造，学习苏联先进经验；（三）改进劳动组织和操作方法，提高每一交通工人的工作效率。
    应该指出：在提高劳动生产率方面，我们做得是不能令人满意的。我们一方面指望着国家大量向国外定购机械工具，而另一方面我们却又把大量机械工具废置不用。在修船工作上，一方面有些船只不能得到很好的修理，另一方面修船厂又没有足够的生产任务；在水路运输方面，一方面港口工人待时问题严重，另一方面船舶在港非生产停泊时间很长；学习苏联经验还非常没有系统，而且依然存在着不少阻力，有些航务领导机关对内河推广一列式拖带法的先紧后松，海上先进航次的试点工作没能很好的总结，都是很好的例证。工人们的发明创造还遭受到官僚主义的冷淡，没有系统地加以总结和推广；而在劳动组织方面的落后，更是显而易见：我们很多企业的机构是不健全的，没有生产调度机构，没有或不重视技术操作规程，责任制没有普遍建立起来，而最严重的是大量劳力的过剩长期得不到解决，爱国主义的生产竞赛也是极不经常或往往流于形式。
    马林科夫同志说：“在提高劳动生产率方面，技术定额有很大的意义。”〔二〕我们很多企业还没有实行定额管理，有些企业的定额，大部分还是试验统计定额，至于说平均先进定额，如果有的话，恐怕也是很少的。定额过低不能刺激劳动生产率的增长，而没有定额管理，便说不上成本核算和计划管理。
    提高劳动生产率的最大敌人是保守主义和以官僚主义态度对待企业管理。保守主义者看不见潜在的因素，更不愿从发展的观点上来考察问题。而官僚主义者则只满足于原则领导和既得的成绩。无论保守主义也好，官僚主义也好，他们都是不愿系统地、实际地研究上级指示和在其他企业已经实行而且卓著成效的先进经验来改进自己底工作。他们认为工作效率低是当然的；他们甚至认为可以不必深入细致地实事求是地考察每一企业的具体情况，找出中心环节，指出发展方向来，而只要给予一般的指示，就可以把事情办好的。事实证明保守思想和官僚主义如果不被克服，我们的企业管理将不可能前进一步。
    三
    价值法则的另一个要求是每一个企业都要有赢利（当然在我国国营企业中的赢利问题与资本主义企业的赢利问题是有根本不同的性质的。），也就是说要替国家增加积累，这就要求我们厉行节约制度。
    节约制度是社会主义的经营方法，是国营企业资金积累的重要来源，对国家工业化是有决定意义的。必须充分地、合理地利用生产资源，精打细算地来管理企业，才能更好地发展我们的经济。
    应该说，节约制度在我们交通事业中还远没有很好地建立起来。这主要表现在：
    第一、我们的成本是心中无数的。有些企业在做财务计划时，总是预计全年要亏损若干，而到年终决算时，却又有了意外的盈余。某一企业一九五三年第一季的计划利润是六亿，而实际利润是六十亿，但生产计划却没有完成。严重问题是这种现象在交通部所属企业中这还不是偶然的。成本管理情况如此，也就不难想像在原料、材料、燃料、工具等方面的巨大浪费。不论在运输和基本建设方面，许多单位都用提高消耗定额和劳动量指标的方法来使成本计划中埋伏下庞大的后备力量。我们再也不能容忍这种现象继续存在下去了，唯一的办法是要加强对各企业的财政监督，切实地研究每个企业的生产条件，采取必要的措施来消灭“埋伏”，并保证有步骤地降低成本。
    第二、马林科夫同志批评苏联运输企业中的巨大损失和非生产的开支时说：“在许多轮船和汽车运输机构中，由于未能完成载运计划，车厢、轮船和汽车的停歇时间很长，由于燃料的额外消耗以及因经营不善而引起的许多损失，超支和亏损的数额是很大的。”〔三〕我们的情况也正是这样，以一九五二年全年来看，根据各港报来的资料统计，海船非生产停泊时间要占总停泊时间的百分之五十八。今年第一季度的统计，长江上海调度段所属船舶全部停泊时间中装卸时间只占百分之十六，非装卸停泊时间占百分之八十四；码头工人待时情形也很严重，某港今年第一季度共损失全部工时的百分之四十九。修船脱期已经是经常的事，而修船费用之高，严重地影响着运输的成本（某海运局统计，修船费占成本的百分之二十五）。
    第三、在运输过程中造成的货物损失也是惊人的。大米、面粉装上船，在航行中或由于船上水管破裂，或由于配傤封舱不佳而致糜烂，在装卸过程中又常把口袋弄破而造成大量的损耗。在港口有时成箱的玻璃被打碎，成车的大豆发了芽，许多铁管在卸船时被弄弯。虽然目前这种损失还缺乏全国的统计，但总数可以肯定是惊人的！但这还没有引起我们各级领导上应有的注意，及时采取必要的措施来纠正。
    第四、行政管理费用在我们企业和基本建设单位的财务计划中都占很大的比例，个别企业的管理费高达百分之十五，有些企业和基本建设单位甚至没有关于管理费用较确实的计算。不少企业都有一个庞大的管理机构，一条远洋大船的正常定员是四十至五十人，而我们沿海中小船只的船员有多至百人左右的。
    正如马林科夫同志所指出：“许多领导者已经忘记节约制度，他们不关心合理地和节省地使用国家经费，他们对他们所领导的企业和机关的财务经济工作的改进没有予以适当的注意”，这都是很不好的，“必须根除一切浪费物力、人力和财力的现象，有计划地保证完成和超额完成降低产品成本的任务。”〔四〕
    四
    要想改进我们运输企业的经营管理，纠正普遍存在于各企业中的严重缺点，必须提高党组织对于各个企业的领导水平。
    我们交通部门的各级领导思想是落后于党和国家底要求及群众觉悟的，只要你深入了解一下实际情况，你就会发现党和政府底一些指示没有贯彻，许多工人的创造被埋没，基层生产单位的劳动业绩被搁置在公文夹和抽屉中。这种官僚主义现象，企业中的党组织必须经常不断地注意和检查，并依靠群众力量，向官僚主义现象展开不妥协的斗争。
    第一、必须展开自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。在社会主义性质的国营企业里，必须有效地举起批评与自我批评的武器，向一切障碍生产发展的惰性力量进行斗争。党组织的领导力量应该表现在：当一个新生事物还在萌芽中，就能够被发现，并得到足够的支持，使之发展成长起来；当一个新的危险在萌芽中也能及时看出，并不使其发展成为一种威胁。党要能够做到这一点就必须时时刻刻地提高警觉，并在竞赛中开展批评，以发扬好的因素克服坏的因素。斯大林同志把社会主义竞赛称作“群众实事求是的革命自我批评的表现，这种自我批评是依靠千百万劳动群众创造的主动性”〔五〕。他并且揭露了斯达哈诺夫运动所要克服的那些矛盾：“显然，这一个运动曾须冲破某些堤防。有人妨碍过它，有人拘束过它，而这个斯达汉诺夫运动既经把精锐积蓄起来，就冲破这些堤防而泛滥于全国了。”〔六〕应该说：我们在掌握和使用批评武器来冲破某些旧的堤防，还是做得非常不够的，我们往往满足于和平共居，甚至我们被某些惰性力量所蒙蔽，致使得交通企业的发展处于一种迂缓的状态中，这是亟须克服的。
    第二、必须加强各个企业中的纪律性。运输企业是点线相连的，需要各地密切配合和协同动作，才能更好地完成任务。还不能说我们各个港口和船舶之间，车站与车辆之间以及车船与工厂之间的联系配合已经做得很好了；当然这种配合在更高一级的领导上是要负重大的责任的，但各生产单位之间的自觉地主动地配合，也有同样的重大意义。是不是“还有少数工作人员，忘记委托他们管理领导的企业是国家企业，竟然企图把这些企业变为他们的世袭领地，在这里，这种领导者——假如还可以这样称呼他的话——认为他能够‘随心所欲’地做任何事情。”〔七〕在我们这里是有的，这种不遵守统一的计划不协同配合的现象是必须克服的。党组织在运输企业中的任务就在于建立并保持高度的组织性和纪律性。维护国家法令的严肃性，保证计划的完成，向一切违法乱纪各自为政的现象进行不妥协的斗争。
    第三、必须正确地挑选干部，来改善我们领导干部的成份。应该坚决地把生产中的积极分子提拔到领导岗位上来，并帮助他们顺利地学会做领导工作。挑选干部的主要条件只能是政治品质和业务能力，坚决地以优秀的、称职的、先进的、忠诚的人来领导我们的企业。决不能容许“一些正直的、通晓业务的工作人员，因他们对缺点不肯容忍而使领导上感到不舒服，结果便在各种藉口下被排挤出去”。〔八〕党组织必须通过检查工作来发现生产中的积极分子，帮助他们，培养他们，并提拔他们到领导岗位上来，以代替那些居功自傲，故步自封的腐朽的官僚主义者。
    第四、加强思想工作。由于经济工作有很大的事务性和比较容易看出成绩，因此，在我们领导干部中，很有一些人成天忙于事务并开始醉心于既得的成绩，而慢慢地忘记了思想工作的重大作用，没有充分认识到国际国内情势的每一变化都直接影响到我们的生产任务；没有充分认识到中国在解放前是半殖民地半封建社会，直到今天小资产阶级还占人口的多数，形形色色的非无产阶级思想每天都在侵蚀我们。凡是对思想领导放松的地方，就给敌对的观点和观念的复活造成肥土沃壤。马林科夫同志指出：“低估思想工作的重要性在很大程度上是我们一部分领导干部没有努力提高自己的觉悟、充实马克思列宁主义的知识和吸取党的历史经验的结果。而没有这一点，就不可能成为真正的成熟的领导者。一个人如果在思想上和政治上落后，按照死记的公式生活、丧失对于新鲜事物的感觉，他就不能正确地分析国内外的形势，不能也不配站在运动的前列，而且迟早终有一天他会被现实生活抛弃。”〔九〕我觉得每一个做领导工作的人，都应该根据马林科夫同志底这一段话进行一番痛切的反省，是不是我们已经丧失了政治上的敏感和布尔什维克底上进心，是不是我们已经或将要堕落成为一个鼠目寸光的政治上的庸人？值得注意的是我们很多部门的党组织没能积极地在思想上起领导作用。党组织必须及时正视这种事实，深入到基层的生产单位去，把生产中最活动最革命的力量发动起来，从思想上清除人们意识中封建的资本主义的残余、旧社会的偏见和有害传统，这样才能负起领导生产的责任。
