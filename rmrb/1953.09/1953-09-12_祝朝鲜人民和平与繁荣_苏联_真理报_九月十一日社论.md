The government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, arrived in Moscow on the 10th at the invitation of the Soviet government. The Soviet people from all walks of life express their respect to all the heroic people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea through the Korean government delegation, who defended their right to control their own destiny and the destiny of their motherland in the heroic struggle against the interventionists.

American imperialism launched the Korean War, attempting to occupy the entire Korean Peninsula and turn it into a springboard for attacking the Soviet Union and People's China, and to undermine the peaceful cause of the Chinese people in transforming their great country. The aggressors not only deployed their elite land, sea, and air forces, but also the armed forces of their allies into Korea. However, they failed to achieve their original goals, and instead suffered huge military, moral, and political defeats.

The people's democratic system withstood the comprehensive test in the Korean War, demonstrating its vitality and ability to organize the defense of national independence. The Korean people's struggle against the interventionists and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee clique, once again proved that loyalty to the cause of freedom and independence of the motherland can generate great perseverance, heroism, and a spirit of collective heroism. The Korean people, attacked by the most powerful war machine of modern imperialism, have become invincible because they are fighting for a just cause.

At the same time, people will never forget the lofty achievements of the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers who went to aid the Korean people. Not only the great Chinese people but all progressive mankind are proud of this achievement.

During the war years, the heroic Korean people received fraternal support and assistance from the entire peace and democracy camp. The American ruling circles have not been able to isolate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea internationally. The Korean people have defended their independence because they belong to the democratic camp, and the characteristic of the interrelationship within this camp is close cooperation and genuine brotherly friendship. The peace and democracy camp resolutely demanded a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. A large-scale movement to stop the bloodshed in Korea was launched in various countries around the world. The Soviet government's consistent and firm struggle to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue created the necessary preconditions for the conclusion of the armistice agreement, thereby turning the war into peace.

The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a great victory for the heroic Korean people and the valiant Chinese People's Volunteers. At the same time, it is also a great victory for the entire peace and democracy camp. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement clearly and convincingly demonstrates that the people's desire for peace has grown into such a powerful force that the open and hidden enemies of peace have to yield to this force.

Now, the most important tasks facing the Korean people are to restore the national reunification of the Korean nation and to restore the national economy destroyed by the war. All upright people are eager for the glorious patriots of Korea to successfully complete these tasks and achieve prosperity under peaceful conditions.

The Soviet people warmly support the Soviet government's decision to assist the Korean people. The Soviet government has allocated 1 billion rubles for the restoration of the national economy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The governments of Poland, Hungary, and other people's democratic countries have also adopted decisions on assisting the Korean people. Fraternal assistance inspires the working people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to perform meritorious services in the struggle to restore the national economy and improve the people's living standards. The outstanding qualities of the Korean working people, which promoted victory in the war: heroism, perseverance, and unlimited loyalty to the motherland and its interests, are being further developed in a peaceful environment. Only a month and a half after the guns fell silent and the barbaric bombings by the American air force ceased, many mines and factories in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have been restored. According to the Korean Central News Agency, the initial Soviet assistance is to help Korea restore and rebuild the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works, the Kim Chaek city steel plant, the Nampo non-ferrous metal plant, the Sunghori chemical factory and cement factory, and the Supung hydroelectric power plant. The restoration of these enterprises will lay the foundation for the rapid restoration and continued development of the industry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Premier Kim Il-sung of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea said in a statement upon arriving in Moscow on the 10th: "I am deeply convinced that this visit of the Korean government delegation to Moscow will help to further consolidate the fraternal friendly relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, help to most rapidly restore and develop the destroyed national economy and further consolidate the people's democratic system of our republic, and at the same time will help to unite our motherland in a peaceful manner, and help to strengthen peace and security in Asia."

The peace-loving people of all countries are pleased with the achievements made by the working people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the great cause of restoring the national economy destroyed by the war, while they have not forgotten for a minute that the international aggressive forces are still full of malice towards the Korean people. The signing of the armistice agreement is a victory for the idea of peaceful resolution of all international disputes and a clear demonstration of the bankruptcy of the notorious American "policy of strength." However, the certain relaxation of international tensions resulting from the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement runs counter to the wishes of those who are closely tied to aggressive policies and international adventurous policies.

The peace-loving people of all countries are concerned that the future of Korea depends first and foremost on the interests of the Korean people themselves, and therefore they cannot ignore the war-mongering statements made by some American leaders on the Korean issue. They cannot fail to notice the provocative actions of the Syngman Rhee clique, which is loyal to the United States, which even openly declared that it would tear up the armistice agreement. All sensible people can see very clearly that the aggressive forces cannot intimidate the Korean people and the Chinese people, nor can they force them to abandon their national interests.

The Soviet Union is ready to do its best to help the Korean people, to ensure that they live a peaceful life and heal the serious wounds caused by the war.

    祝朝鲜人民和平与繁荣
    ——苏联“真理报”九月十一日社论
    以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团应苏联政府的邀请，在十日抵达莫斯科。苏联各界人民通过朝鲜政府代表团向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国全体英勇的人民表示敬意，他们在反抗干涉者的英雄斗争中捍卫住了自己支配自己的命运和支配祖国的命运的权利。
    美帝国主义发动了朝鲜战争，企图占领整个朝鲜半岛，并把它变为进攻苏联和人民中国的跳板，破坏中国人民改造自己伟大国家的和平事业。侵略者不但把自己精锐的陆、海、空军部队、而且把自己盟国的武装力量也投入了朝鲜。但是，他们没有能够达到原定的目标，反而遭到了军事上、道义上和政治上的巨大失败。
    人民民主制度在朝鲜战争中经受住了全面的考验，表现出了自己的生命力和组织保卫民族独立的能力。朝鲜人民反对干涉者和他们的走狗李承晚集团的斗争又一次地证明了：对于为祖国的自由和独立的事业的忠诚，能够产生伟大的坚韧、英勇、集体英雄主义的精神。遭受到现代帝国主义最强大的战争机器进攻的朝鲜人民已成为不可战胜的，因为他们是为正义事业而战。
    同时，人们永远不会忘记前往援助朝鲜人民的光荣的中国人民志愿军的崇高的功绩。不但伟大的中国人民而且全体进步人类也都为这种功绩而骄傲。
    英雄的朝鲜人民在战争年代中受到整个和平民主阵营的兄弟般的支持和援助。美国统治集团并没有能使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在国际上陷于孤立。朝鲜人民保卫住了自己的独立，因为他们是属于民主阵营的，而这个阵营的相互关系的特点是密切的合作和真正的兄弟般的友谊。和平民主阵营坚决要求和平解决朝鲜问题。世界各国曾展开了争取停止朝鲜流血的声势壮大的运动。苏联政府为争取和平解决朝鲜问题所进行的始终不渝的和坚定的斗争，为缔结停战协定创造了必需的先决条件，从而使战争变为和平。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订是英雄的朝鲜人民和英勇的中国人民志愿军的伟大胜利。同时，也是整个和平民主阵营的巨大胜利。朝鲜停战协定的签订，明显而令人信服地表明了：人民要求和平的愿望已成长为如此强大的力量，以致公开的和隐藏的和平敌人不得不对这种力量让步。
    现在，朝鲜人民面前摆着恢复朝鲜国家的全国统一这一最重要的任务，以及恢复被战争所破坏了的国民经济的任务。所有正直的人们热望朝鲜的光荣爱国者胜利完成这些任务，并在和平的条件下获得繁荣。
    苏联人民热烈支持苏联政府关于援助朝鲜人民的决定。苏联政府已拨出十亿卢布作为恢复朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国民经济之用。波兰、匈牙利和其他人民民主国家的政府也通过了关于援助朝鲜人民的决定。兄弟般的援助鼓舞着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的劳动人民在恢复国民经济、提高人民生活水平的斗争中建立功勋。在战争中促进了胜利的朝鲜劳动人民的杰出的品质：英勇、坚毅、对祖国和祖国利益的无限忠诚，在和平环境里更加发扬光大。炮声沉寂下来和美国空军野蛮的轰炸停止以后不过一个半月，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的许多矿山和工厂都已恢复了。据朝鲜中央通讯社消息，苏联的初步援助，就是决定帮助朝鲜恢复和改建金策制铁所、金策市的炼钢厂、南浦的有色金属厂、胜湖里的化学工厂和水泥工厂以及水丰发电厂。这些企业恢复后就有可能为迅速恢复和继续发展朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的工业奠定基础。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成在十日抵达莫斯科时发表谈话说：“我深信，朝鲜政府代表团这次到莫斯科来，将有助于进一步巩固朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟之间的兄弟般的友好关系，有助于最迅速地恢复和发展被破坏了的国民经济并进一步巩固我们共和国的人民民主制度，同时也将有助于用和平方式统一我们的祖国，有助于加强亚洲的和平与安全。”
    各国爱好和平的人民对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的劳动人民在恢复被战争破坏的国民经济这一伟大事业中所取得的成绩感到欣慰，同时他们一分钟也没有忘记国际的侵略势力对朝鲜人民仍旧满怀恶意。停战协定的签订就是和平解决一切国际争端的思想的胜利，是臭名昭彰的美国“实力政策”破产的明证。可是，由于朝鲜停战协定的签订而产生的国际紧张气氛的某些缓和是与那些紧紧地系身于侵略政策和国际冒险政策的人物的愿望相背的。
    爱好和平的各国人民关心的是：朝鲜的前途首先要取决于朝鲜人民本身的利益，因而他们不能忽视一些美国首脑人物对朝鲜问题所作的充满好战气息的声明。他们不能不注意到为美国效忠的李承晚集团的挑衅性的蠢动，这一集团竟公开宣称要撕毁停战协定。一切理智的人都看得很清楚：侵略势力是吓不倒朝鲜人民和中国人民的，也不可能使他们放弃自己的民族利益。
    苏联准备尽力帮助朝鲜人民，保证他们过和平的生活和医治战争带来的严重创伤。
