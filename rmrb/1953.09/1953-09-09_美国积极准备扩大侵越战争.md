Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The United States is increasingly brazen in clamoring for the expansion of direct aggression against Indochina.

    Four weeks after US President Eisenhower delivered his speech in Seattle advocating aggression against Indochina, US Secretary of State Dulles, at the annual meeting of the American Legion on September 2nd, again clamored for expanding interference in Indochina. Dulles' speech exposed the US attempt to seize the rich resources of Indochina. He said, "The outcome of the struggle (in Indochina) is related to our (the United States') vital interests in the Western Pacific." After the Korean armistice, "the United States must not lose interest in the Western Pacific region." He even bluntly stated that Indochina "is no longer a French colony."

    Agence France-Presse, Washington, September 2nd dispatch: US diplomatic sources believe that Dulles' speech "is a very important development in the US attitude towards the war in Indochina." Agence France-Presse believes that after Dulles' speech, "the role of the United States in the Indochina war is no longer limited to being a friend of France and the member states of the Union, and supplying materials and money."

    The United States is also actively carrying out deployments to expand the war of aggression against Indochina. According to a United Press Washington dispatch: The US Embassy in France has been discussing Marshal Navarre's military plan with the French government, "The US Embassy has made it clear that the next battle must be decisive, and therefore, France and the United States must do everything possible to make it decisive." Reuters said: "Washington officials hope that Navarre can achieve some important victories in the upcoming battle, so as to impress the French Parliament and the US Congress, and prompt them to give more support to the Indochina battlefield throughout 1954." US munitions in support of France's new military plan are also being shipped to Indochina in a steady stream. United Press reported that the US Department of Defense and the State Department fully recognize that, since the only large-scale war currently underway is in Indochina, Indochina must be given priority in obtaining munitions. In addition, according to Washington "columnist" Allen, in addition to allocating a large amount of munitions, the United States plans to provide 1 billion US dollars in aid to the French invading Vietnam in this fiscal year.

    美国积极准备扩大侵越战争
    【新华社六日讯】美国越来越嚣张地叫喊要扩大对印度支那的直接侵略。
    在美国总统艾森豪威尔在西雅图发表他的侵略印度支那的演说以后四个星期，美国国务卿杜勒斯又于九月二日在美国退伍军人团年会上叫喊扩大对印度支那的干涉。杜勒斯的演说暴露了美国企图攫夺印度支那富源的目的，他说：“（在印度支那）斗争的结果关系到我们（美国）在西太平洋的切身利益。”在朝鲜停战后，“美国决不能对西太平洋地区不再关心”。他甚至露骨地说，印度支那“已不再是一个法国殖民地。”
    法新社华盛顿二日消息说：美国外交界人士认为杜勒斯的演说“是美国对印度支那战争的态度上的很重要的发展。”法新社认为：在杜勒斯演说发表以后，“美国在印度支那战争中的作用不再限于作法国和联邦成员国的友人和供给物资和金钱了。”
    美国扩大侵略印度支那战争的部署也在积极进行中。据合众社华盛顿消息透露：美国驻法国大使馆已与法国政府对侵越法军总司令纳瓦尔的军事计划进行商谈，“美国大使馆已经说清楚，下一个战役必须是决定性的，因此，法国和美国必须尽一切能力使它成为决定性的。”路透社说：“华盛顿官方人士希望纳瓦尔在即将来到的战役中能够获得一些重要的胜利，从而使法国议会和美国国会都得到好印象，并促使他们在一九五四年整个一年中给印度支那战场更多的支持。”美国支持法国新军事计划的军火也正在源源运往印度支那。合众社消息说，美国国防部和国务院完全认识到，由于现在正在进行的唯一大规模战争是在印度支那，因此必须使印度支那优先得到军火。又据华盛顿的“专栏作家”艾伦透露，美国除了拨运大量军火以外，将计划在本会计年度中以十亿美元援助侵越法军。
