    In Geoje Island – A Diary of an American Officer –
    Fang Cheng

    I. This morning, those prisoners of war who "would rather die than go home" caused trouble again. What a nuisance!

    II. Tonight, petitions from "prisoners of war" expressing "refusal to be repatriated" were sent over again. We cannot but consider their "individual rights" based on "humanitarian principles."

    III. The sick and wounded prisoners of war being discharged from the hospital tonight are really too much, actually repaying our "medical treatment" like this!

    IV. According to the "principles" of the Geneva Convention, we prepared a large amount of food and water for the prisoners of war today.

    V. Repatriation of prisoners of war began today. Before parting, we presented many souvenirs.

    VI. Representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross Societies are coming to visit. We received orders this morning to quickly send people to "fully cooperate" with them and "provide them with convenience."

    一、今天早晨，那些“宁死也不愿回家”的战俘们又闹事了，真麻烦！
    二、今晚，“战俘”们表示“拒绝遣返”的请愿书又送来了。我们不能不以“人道原则”来考虑他们的“个人权利”。
    三、今晚出院的病伤战俘们也实在太那个了，居然这样来报答我们的“医疗”！
    四、根据日内瓦公约的“原则”，我们今天给战俘们准备了大批的食物和水。
    五、今天开始遣返战俘了。临别，我们赠送了不少纪念品。
    六、朝中红十字会代表要来访问了。今天上午已接到命令，赶紧派人与他们“充分合作”，并“予以便利”。
