Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th -- Today, one Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel, who was not directly repatriated by the U.S. side, returned to the embrace of the motherland after breaking through the control of Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents. His name is Gui Rangpin. On the 13th, he was handed over by the U.S. side to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody. At dawn on the 14th, while the special agents in the prisoner-of-war camp were not awake, he quietly crawled out of the barbed wire and expressed his true wish for repatriation to the guard troops.

　　At 10:30 a.m. on the 16th, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission sent a medium-sized jeep, accompanied by six Indian soldiers, to take him to the Panmunjom conference area. Here, Gui Rangpin was warmly welcomed by General Li Xiangchao, General Ding Guoyu, and staff members of the Korean and Chinese side.

　　Gui Rangpin was wearing a self-made Chinese People's Volunteer Army cap with a red star drawn on it, which he had made himself during the two days he was held in isolation. After getting out of the car, he widened his eyes to examine the welcoming crowd and asked, "Are these all our people?" This twenty-five-year-old youth, having suffered long-term cruel persecution, often harbored suspicion and fear of his surroundings. When our staff told him that he had returned to the embrace of the motherland, tears of excitement streamed down his sallow face.

　　Then, in the rest tent, he accused the U.S. side and Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents of forcibly tattooing Kuomintang flags and insulting words on the chests and backs of prisoners of war, as well as their criminal activities of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

    突破特务控制要求遣返
    我被俘人员一人归来
    【新华社开城十六日电】今天，一名没有被美方直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员在突破蒋匪特务分子的控制以后，回到了祖国怀抱。他的名字叫贵让品。他在十三日被美方交给中立国遣返委员会看管，十四日拂晓，他乘战俘营中的特务们没有醒来时，悄悄地爬出铁丝网，向看管部队表示了要求遣返的真实意愿。
    十六日上午十时半，中立国遣返委员会派一辆中型吉普车并由六个印度士兵陪同，将他送到了板门店会场区。在这里，贵让品受到了李相朝将军、丁国钰将军和朝中方面工作人员的热烈欢迎。
    贵让品戴着自制的中国人民志愿军军帽，帽子上还画着一颗红星，这是他在两天被隔离看管期间亲手做成的。他下车以后就睁大了眼睛审视着欢迎他的人群，并问道：“这里都是我们的人吗？”这个二十五岁的青年因长期受着残酷的迫害，以致经常对周围环境抱着怀疑和恐惧的心理。当我方工作人员告诉他已经回到祖国怀抱以后，他的枯黄的脸庞上流下了激动的眼泪。
    然后，他就在休息帐篷里，向记者控诉美方和蒋匪特务在战俘胸前和背上强迫刺上国民党旗子和侮辱性字句以及强迫扣留战俘的罪恶活动。
