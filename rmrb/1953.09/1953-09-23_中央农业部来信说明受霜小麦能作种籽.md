    Central Ministry of Agriculture Letter Explains Frost-Affected Wheat Can Be Used as Seed
    Editor's Note: Recently, we have continuously received letters from readers in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanxi and other places, asking whether frost-affected wheat can be used as seed. Now, we are excerpting the reply from the Central Ministry of Agriculture on this issue as follows:
    This year, it was the wheat plants that suffered frost damage, not the wheat seeds. According to existing scientific experiments, frost-damaged wheat can germinate, and the germination rate is very high. In order to solve this problem, Henan Province conducted germination tests on frost-affected wheat in eight special districts, twenty-two counties and cities. These areas tested seventy-seven varieties, with the most tests reaching more than ten times. The test methods were divided into indoor tests and field tests. The results of the tests in various places showed that the germination rate was generally above 90%. For example, the germination rate of "Si San Ba" wheat in Xingyang, Zhengzhou Special District, reached 98%, and the germination rate of "Bai He Lu" wheat, which was reborn after frost, reached 100%. Anhui Provincial Farm also collected twenty-two kinds of frost-damaged wheat seeds near Bengbu for testing, and the results showed that the average germination rate was above 90%.
    As for whether using this frost-damaged wheat as seed will reduce production? Although the grains of frost-affected wheat are relatively shriveled and small and contain less nutrients, this can only slightly affect the growth of seedlings and has little impact on the growth and grain-filling process of wheat. Whether wheat can achieve a bumper harvest is determined by many factors, such as soil, water, fertilizer, variety, cultivation techniques, and whether natural disasters can be prevented and controlled in time. Seeds are only one of many factors. In 1950, the grains of wheat affected by yellow rust in some areas were even smaller than the grains of wheat affected this time, but by using this wheat as seed and carrying out processing and management of the wheat fields, the wheat harvest was still not bad.
    Furthermore, historical facts and the experience of veteran farmers can also prove that using frost-affected wheat as seed will not affect the germination rate and yield. In Huixing Town, Qian Shanzhou, Henan Province, wheat suffered severe frost damage twenty years ago. The growth and harvest of wheat fields where farmers used frost-affected wheat as seed were the same as in normal years. Some elderly farmers in Linyi, Shandong, believe that as long as frost-damaged wheat seeds are not moldy or broken, they can generally germinate, head, and set grain. They also remember that more than thirty years ago, there was a time when wheat was more severely frozen than this year, but the wheat fields sown with frost-affected wheat seeds that year had very good emergence and harvest.
    Although there is no problem with the germination rate of frost-damaged wheat as seed, this kind of wheat is different from ordinary wheat after all. In particular, some areas have experienced rain (during harvest), dampness (during threshing or storage), and pests and diseases after the wheat was frosted. Therefore, when using it as seed in these areas, seed selection should be done well through methods such as screening, wind selection, and water selection, and germination rate tests should be carried out. In areas with wheat smut, seed disinfection should also be done well. Seed selection and disinfection should never be ignored.

### 中央农业部来信说明受霜小麦能作种籽

    中央农业部来信说明受霜小麦能作种籽
    编者按：近来我们不断收到河南、安徽、江苏、山西等地读者来信，询问受霜小麦能否作种籽的问题。现在将中央农业部对这一问题的答复摘发如下：
    今年受霜灾的是麦株，不是麦种。根据现有的科学试验证明，受霜害的小麦是可以发芽的，并且发芽率很高。河南省为了解决这一问题，曾有八个专区、二十二个县和市进行了受霜小麦的发芽试验。这些地区试验的品种有七十七种，试验的次数最多的达十几次，试验的方法分室内试验和田间试验两种，各地试验结果，发芽率一般都在百分之九十以上。如郑州专区荥阳“四三八”小麦发芽率到百分之九十八，霜后重生的“白河潞”小麦发芽率到百分之百。安徽省农场在蚌埠附近也搜集受霜害麦种二十二种进行了试验，结果发芽率平均在百分之九十以上。
    至于用这种受霜害小麦作种籽会不会减产呢？受霜小麦颗粒虽然比较瘪小，含有养分较少，但这只能轻微地影响幼苗生长，对小麦生长、结实过程影响不大。小麦能否丰产，是由土壤、水分、肥料、品种、栽培技术及自然灾害能不能及时防治等多种因素所构成的，种籽只是多种因素之一。一九五○年一些地区遭黄锈病的小麦颗粒，比这次受害的小麦的颗粒还小，可是用这种小麦作种，经过对麦田加工管理，小麦收成依然不坏。
    再从历史事实和老农的经验也可以证明，受霜小麦作种发芽率和产量都不会受到影响。河南前陕州会兴镇在二十年前小麦曾受严重霜灾，农民用受霜的小麦作种的麦田生长情况和收获量都和常年一样。山东临沂一些年老的农民认为受过霜害的小麦种籽只要不霉、不碎，一般都能发芽、抽穗、结实。他们还记得在三十多年前，有一次小麦受冻比今年还重，可是那年用受霜麦种播种的麦田，出苗和收成都很好。
    受霜害的小麦作种籽对发芽率虽然没有问题，但是这种小麦毕竟和一般小麦不同，特别是有些地区小麦在受霜以后又受到雨淋（收获时）、潮湿（在打场或储存时）和病虫害，因此这些地区在用它做种籽时更应通过筛选、风选、水选等方法做好种籽精选工作，并进行发芽率试验；有黑穗病的地区还应做好种籽消毒工作；绝不能忽视种籽精选和消毒工作。
