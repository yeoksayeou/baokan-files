 Shandong Province Cooperatives at all levels, in supplying production materials, actively implement the policy of using local materials, local processing, and local supply, vigorously explore sources of small farm tools and fertilizers, and expand supply, achieving great results. According to statistics, the province supplied farmers with more than one million pieces of small farm tools in May, June, and July; and supplied more than 330 million jin of oil cake, more than 41 million jin of chemical fertilizer, and more than 33 million jin of miscellaneous fertilizer in June and July. Most of these small farm tools and fertilizers were purchased, processed, and supplied locally by county cooperatives. Cooperatives in Laiyang, Wendeng, Changwei and other special districts, in the case that the supply of soybean cake could not meet the needs of farmers, on the one hand, purchased large quantities of cottonseed, hemp seed, raw kernels, manure, etc. locally, and organized local processing and supply; on the other hand, mobilized members to send their soybeans to the cooperatives for processing. This not only helped farmers solve the difficulty of lacking fertilizer, but also increased farmers' income. In particular, more than 90% of the supply of small farm tools relied on local solutions. In May, the Changwei Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Industrial Production Cooperative held a production and marketing integration meeting, signed 63 contracts and 13 agreements, with a total transaction value of 228.8 million yuan, which further strengthened the planning of the cooperative in the supply of small farm tools. In May and June, the Yutai, Fucheng, Juye, Shanxian, Jinxiang and other county cooperatives in the Huxi Special District processed and supplied various small farm tools through local handicraft and industrial production cooperatives, totaling more than 40,000 pieces. In June, the Cuyang Nanyi Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased more than 23,300 jin of scrap iron and organized the processing of small farm tools, which not only met the farmers' needs for small farm tools, but also helped farmers sell scrap products.
    Due to the active implementation of the management policy of using local materials, local processing, and local supply by cooperatives at all levels, not only were the demands of farmers further met, but also the cost of goods was reduced. At present, cooperatives at all levels are actively organizing the supply of autumn production materials to vigorously support farmers' autumn harvest and autumn planting. Cooperatives in various counties of Laiyang Special District have prepared 120,000 pieces of various small farm tools. Laixi County Cooperative has purchased more than 7.7 million jin of soybean cake and hemp seed cake. Other local cooperatives are also actively preparing a large number of small farm tools and fertilizers and other production materials.

    山东省各级合作社贯彻就地取材方针
    大量供应农民生产资料
    山东省各级合作社在供应生产资料中，积极贯彻就地取材、就地加工、就地供应的方针，大力开拓小农具和肥料来源，扩大供应，得到了很大成绩。据统计，全省在五、六、七三个月中共供应给农民小农具一百万件以上；六、七两个月份共供应油饼三亿三千余万斤，化学肥料四千一百余万斤，杂肥三千三百余万斤。这些小农具和肥料，大部分是由各县合作社就地采购、就地加工供应的。莱阳、文登、昌潍等专区合作社，在豆饼供应不能满足农民需要的情况下，一方面就地采购大批棉籽、麻籽、生仁、大粪等，就地组织加工供应；一方面发动社员将自己的大豆送到合作社来加工。这不仅帮助农民解决了缺乏肥料的困难，而且还增加了农民的收入。特别是小农具的供应，百分之九十以上都是依靠当地解决的。五月份昌潍专区供销合作社和工业生产合作社，召开了一次产销结合会议，签订了六十三份合同，十三份协议，交易总值达两亿二千八百余万元，使合作社在供应小农具工作上进一步加强了计划性。湖西专区的鱼台、复程、钜野、单县、金乡等县合作社，在五、六月份通过当地手工业和工业生产合作社加工供应的各种小农具，约在四万件以上。徂阳南驿供销合作社在六月份收购了两万三千三百余斤废铁，组织加工小农具，不仅满足了农民对小农具的需要，而且还给农民推销了废品。
    由于各级合作社积极贯彻就地取材、就地加工、就地供应的经营方针，不仅进一步满足了农民的要求，而且还降低了商品的成本费用。现在各级合作社正积极组织秋季生产资料的供应，以大力支持农民秋收、秋种。莱阳专区各县合作社已准备各种小农具十二万件。莱西县合作社已购进豆饼、麻籽饼七百七十余万斤。其他各地合作社也积极准备大批小农具和肥料等生产资料。
