What the West German Election Shows
Tan Rui

The second West German Federal Assembly election was held on September 6th. In this election, the Christian Democratic Union—Christian Social Union continued to steal the majority of seats in the Federal Assembly, allowing the Adenauer group to maintain its puppet regime.

What does the West German election show?

Anyone with eyes can see that this election was a dark and terrifying farce, carried out through deception, extortion, intimidation, and assassination.

With the help of his American masters, Adenauer spent twenty months formulating a reactionary election law that further restricted electoral rights. This election law stipulates that half of the members are directly elected by each constituency, and the other half are allocated according to the proportion of votes obtained by the candidate parties on the state lists. Among the half of the seats allocated proportionally, if a party obtains less than 5% of all votes, it cannot obtain a seat. At the same time, the election law also prohibits parties from jointly campaigning. These heavy and unreasonable restrictions are undoubtedly to facilitate the ruling reactionary party's manipulation of the election, seizing seats to ensure that they continue to occupy the majority in the parliament, while forcibly excluding the true representatives of the people, especially the representatives of the German Communist Party, from the parliament. This reactionary election law was even regarded by the West German bourgeois press as Adenauer's means of preparing for an "unarmed coup." The Adenauer group used this election law, as well as the conspiracy of redrawing electoral districts (splitting up constituencies where the Communist Party had an advantage, such as the Ruhr), to invalidate hundreds of thousands of votes obtained by the German Communist Party in this election, thereby depriving it of its seats in the Federal Assembly. But this is just one step in the Adenauer group's manipulation of the election.

During the campaign, the Adenauer government adopted despicable means to obstruct the German Communist Party and other democratic organizations from carrying out campaign activities, arresting, persecuting, and even assassinating their candidates, confiscating their campaign materials, and instigating fascist elements to attack and disrupt their campaign rallies, preventing them from contacting voters. On the eve of the election, the Bonn authorities even more frantically carried out mass arrests, arresting more than 7,000 patriotic people who opposed Adenauer's policies in a few days. During the voting, the Adenauer regime dispatched 100,000 armed military police and mobilized a large number of fascist elements to monitor and threaten voters. In such a fascist atmosphere of terror, the West German people were not carrying out any election, but were forced to sign and acknowledge the Adenauer group's continued occupation of power.

The ugliness of the matter doesn't stop there. This West German election was directly subjected to the shameless and tyrannical interference of American reactionary forces. In order to support the Adenauer group, the United States not only paid them 6 million marks in campaign expenses, not only released a large number of Nazi war criminals to help Adenauer "campaign," but also tried every means in diplomacy to support Adenauer. The United States tried its best to delay the holding of a Four-Power conference to discuss the German issue, making a hypocritical gesture of being willing to discuss the German issue with the Soviet Union, in order to ease the West German people's dissatisfaction with the Adenauer regime's reliance on its American masters and obstruction of German reunification. Eisenhower even wrote a letter to Adenauer, expressing his public support for him, saying that the Adenauer regime and the U.S. government "have been ardently working together" to restore the peaceful reunification of Germany.

But this was not enough. Three days before the election, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles personally stepped forward, using the tactics of a Chicago gangster to threaten the West German people, openly declaring that if the current Bonn government coalition headed by Adenauer were defeated in the election, the German people would suffer disastrous consequences. This undisguised interference in the West German election aroused great anger among all sections of the West German people. West German public opinion strongly condemned this as a great insult to the German people. Social Democratic newspapers believed that Dulles's actions made West Germany "suddenly become an American constituency." Hamburg Mayor Brauer called on the West German people to condemn Dulles's statement based on the premise that "Germans are colonial people." Even the British bourgeois press expressed dissatisfaction with Dulles's actions, accusing it of "blatantly disrupting international etiquette" and being "extremely reckless."

Dulles's interference in the West German election was not accidental. Interfering in the internal affairs of other countries has always been an aggressive tactic used by the American ruling clique; only by relying on this tactic can American reactionary forces cultivate reactionary regimes in other countries that listen to their commands. Dulles, who is accustomed to issuing orders, has never taken the sovereignty of other countries into account, let alone West Germany, which is just a puppet state manufactured by the United States! But this completely exposes the lie that the United States has always claimed that West Germany is an "equal country."

What is the reason that made Dulles so panicked that he shamelessly came out publicly to interfere in the West German election, threatening the West German people to elect Adenauer?

It is well known that Adenauer is a docile tool for the imperialist group headed by the United States to implement the division of Germany and transform Germany into a base for aggressive war. The Western countries created the Bonn puppet state four years ago and supported the Adenauer group to implement their German policy. Adenauer, a national traitor who was once called by the British bourgeois press as someone who "always cooperates with loyalty and a suitable posture, and always seeks compromise at the cost of betraying German interests," has faithfully followed the policies of the Western occupiers since taking office, becoming a powerful assistant for them to rule and enslave the West German people. For four years, in order to maintain the division of Germany and obstruct the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, Adenauer has vigorously opposed the East and West German people reaching an agreement on the issue of German reunification, repeatedly rejecting the proposals of the German Democratic Republic to hold all-German conferences. In order to implement the Western countries' plan to restore West Germany as a war hotbed in Europe, Adenauer actively rebuilt the Hitler Wehrmacht, employing Nazi war criminals and fascist elements in large numbers. In Adenauer's foreign ministry alone, 85 percent of the main officials were former Hitler elements. In May of last year, Adenauer signed the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" treaty with Western countries, selling out national interests, turning West Germany into a dependent province of Western countries, continuing to be occupied for fifty years, and providing twelve divisions of mercenary troops to the Western European aggressive bloc, turning the West German people into cannon fodder for the Western reactionary forces to carry out new aggressive adventures. Adenauer's consistent traitorous acts have proved to his American masters that he is the most loyal lackey. No wonder the American propaganda machine praised him as "the most enthusiastic supporter of the United States in Europe," saying that he was "almost the only real American candidate" in this election.

The German people have always been fiercely opposed to Adenauer, a traitor. The reason why the Adenauer group can continue to govern is not because the West German people need it, but because the reactionary forces of the United States need it. Recently, due to the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and the entire peace camp, the possibility of a peaceful resolution of the German issue has greatly increased. The German people and the people of the world are urgently demanding that the German issue be resolved quickly. However, the reactionary forces of the United States are attempting to collude with the Adenauer group to continue to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the German issue in order to maintain tensions and prepare for new war adventures. Therefore, after the Bonn election, the United States and the Adenauer group became even more arrogant. Washington released air that "the United States will adopt a 'take it or leave it' policy when dealing with the Soviet Union on the German issue after this incident (referring to the Bonn election); the Soviet Union will have to agree to hold free elections as the basis for unifying Germany, otherwise, the division of Germany will be maintained" (Agence France-Presse, Washington). Observers in London pointed out that the United States will exert pressure on Britain and France in the future, requiring them to "adopt a tough policy towards the Soviet Union to the point where it is difficult for the Soviet Union to meet Western demands, making German unification extremely unlikely." At the same time, Adenauer also frantically clamored to "liberate the East," claiming that "strength is needed" to achieve the goals of "unifying Germany" and "unifying Europe." Therefore, the re-emergence of the Adenauer group is undoubtedly a serious threat to German reunification and European peace.

The Bonn election thoroughly exposed what the United States has consistently insisted on, that holding "all-German free elections" as a prerequisite for resolving the German issue, is all about. Now people can see that under American occupation and interference, and under Adenauer's fascist tyranny, there can be no "free elections" at all. The so-called "all-German free elections" advocated by the United States is actually to impose the West German-style electoral violence on the entire German people, to extend Adenauer's rule to the whole of Germany, and to turn the entire Germany into a vassal state and military base of the United States. This is incompatible with the goal of Germany being restored as a unified, independent, and peaceful country. Facts have proven that only in accordance with the Soviet Union's proposal, with the East and West German parliaments and democratic forces forming a provisional all-German government to prepare for elections, can the German people achieve the peaceful reunification of Germany without foreign interference.

Although the Adenauer group has maintained its puppet regime, it cannot prevent the realization of the German people's noble aspiration for peaceful reunification. As Comrade Malenkov pointed out: "The fate of Germany is in the hands of the German people." In this election, the West German people have further realized the correct path they should follow in striving for peace, reunification, and independence, and their struggle against the Adenauer group's treasonous conspiracy will surely rise more courageously.

    西德选举说明了什么
    谭文瑞
    西德的第二届联邦议院选举已于九月六日举行了。在这次选举中，基督教民主联盟—基督教社会联盟继续窃取了联邦议院中的多数席位，使阿登纳集团得以维持它的傀儡政权。
    西德的选举说明了什么呢？
    只要有眼睛的人都可以看到，这次选举完全是一幕黑暗、恐怖的丑剧；它是在欺骗、讹诈、恫吓和暗杀之下举行的。
    阿登纳在他的美国主子的帮助下，曾费了二十个月的时间制订了进一步限制选举权利的反动的选举法。这个选举法规定议员的一半由各选区直接选出，另一半则按州名单中候选政党所得选票比例分配。而在一半按比例分配的议席中，如果一个政党所得选票不足全部选票的百分之五，就不能得到议席。同时，选举法还禁止各政党联合竞选。这种重重的无理限制，无疑是为了便利当政的反动政党操纵选举，夺取议席，以便保证它们在议会中继续占据多数，而硬把真正的人民代表特别是德国共产党的代表排斥出议会。这种反动的选举法，甚至连西德的资产阶级报刊也认为是阿登纳准备“非武装政变”的手段。阿登纳集团就是利用这一选举法以及重划选区（把像鲁尔这样的共产党占优势的选区分割开来）的阴谋，将德国共产党在这次选举中所得到的数十万选票作废，从而剥夺了它在联邦议院中的议席。但是这还只不过是阿登纳集团操纵选举的一个步骤。
    在竞选期间，阿登纳政府采取了卑鄙的手段，百般阻挠共产党和其他民主组织进行竞选活动，逮捕、迫害甚至暗杀他们的候选人，没收他们的竞选材料，并唆使法西斯分子袭击和破坏他们的竞选集会，阻止他们与选民接触。在选举前夕，波恩当局更疯狂地进行大逮捕，几天之内便抓了七千多反对阿登纳政策的爱国分子。在投票的时候，阿登纳政权又出动了十万名武装军警并动员了大批法西斯分子对选民进行监视和威胁。在这样的法西斯的恐怖气氛之下，西德人民那里是进行什么选举，只是被强制画押，承认阿登纳集团继续霸占政权而已。
    事情的丑恶尚不止此。西德的这次选举直接受到美国反动势力无耻的横暴干涉。为了扶植阿登纳集团，美国不但付给他们以六百万马克的竞选费用，不但释放了一大批纳粹战犯来帮助阿登纳“竞选”，而且，在外交上想尽办法给阿登纳撑腰。美国曾极力拖延举行讨论德国问题的四大国会议，作出了愿意与苏联讨论德国问题的虚伪姿态，以缓和西德人民对阿登纳政权投靠美国主子阻挠德国统一的不满情绪。艾森豪威尔并曾写信给阿登纳，对他表示公开的支持，说什么阿登纳政权和美国政府为了恢复德国的和平统一，“一直在热烈地共同奋斗”。
    但是，这还不足。在选举前三天美国国务卿杜勒斯竟亲自出马，以芝加哥流氓的一套恐吓手段向西德人民进行威胁，他公然宣称：假使目前的以阿登纳为首的波恩政府联盟在选举中被击败的话，德国人民将会遭到灾难性的后果。杜勒斯的这种毫不掩饰的干涉西德选举举动，激起了西德各阶层人民的极大愤怒。西德舆论纷纷指斥这是对德国人民的莫大侮辱。社会民主党的报纸认为杜勒斯的做法，使西德“突然成为美国的选区”。汉堡市市长布劳尔要求西德人民斥责杜勒斯这种以“德国人是殖民地人民”为前提的声明。甚至英国的资产阶级报纸也对杜勒斯的行径表示不满，指责它是“悍然破坏国际礼貌”的“极端卤莽”的行为。
    杜勒斯对西德选举的干涉举动，并不是偶然的。干涉他国内政本来就是美国统治集团惯用的侵略手段；只有依靠这种手段，美国反动势力才能在其他国家培植听他们差遣的反动政权。惯于发号施令的杜勒斯从来没有把其他国家的主权放在眼里，何况西德只不过是美国一手制造的傀儡国家！但是这却彻底揭穿了美国一向把西德说成是“平等国家”的谎言。
    是什么缘故使得杜勒斯如此惊慌失措，以致他毫不知羞耻地公开出面来干涉西德选举，威胁西德人民要他们选阿登纳呢？
    人所共知，阿登纳是以美国为首的帝国主义集团实行分裂德国并变德国为侵略战争基地的驯服的工具。西方国家在四年前制造了波恩傀儡国家，并扶植阿登纳集团来推行它们的对德政策。阿登纳这一个曾被英国资产阶级报纸称为“永远以忠心耿耿和合适姿态来合作，永远以出卖德国利益的代价来谋求妥协”的民族叛徒，在登台以后便唯命是从地奉行西方占领者的政策，成为它们统治和奴役西德人民的得力助手。四年来，为了保持德国的分裂，并阻挠缔结对德和约，阿登纳曾竭力反对东西德人民在统一德国问题上达成协议，再三拒绝德意志民主共和国提出举行全德会议的建议。为了执行西方国家将西德重新恢复为欧洲的战争温床的计划，阿登纳积极重建希特勒国防军，大批启用纳粹战犯和法西斯分子，仅仅在阿登纳的外交部里就有百分之八十五的主要官员是从前的希特勒分子。去年五月，阿登纳与西方国家签订了出卖民族利益的“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”条约，使西德变为西方国家的附庸省份，继续被占领五十年，并向西欧侵略集团提供十二个师的雇佣军，把西德人民作为西方反动势力进行新侵略冒险的炮灰。阿登纳一贯的卖国行径，向他的美国主子证明了他是一个最忠心的奴才，难怪美国的宣传机器要称赞他为“欧洲最热心支持美国的人物”，说他是这次选举中“差不多唯一真正的美国候选人”。
    对于阿登纳这样一个卖国贼，德国人民一直是激烈反对的。阿登纳集团之所以能继续执政，并不是因为西德人民需要它，而是因为美国的反动势力需要它。最近以来，由于苏联、德意志民主共和国以及整个和平阵营的不懈努力，使和平解决德国问题的可能性大大增加，德国人民和全世界人民都迫切地要求使德国问题迅速获得解决，但是美国的反动势力却企图与阿登纳集团串通一气，继续阻挠德国问题的和平解决，以保持紧张局势并准备新的战争冒险。因此在波恩选举后，美国与阿登纳集团就更加嚣张了。华盛顿方面放出空气说：“美国在这次事件（指波恩选举）以后与苏联在德国问题上打交道时将采用一个‘要就要，不要就拉倒’的政策；苏联将不得不同意举行自由选举，作为统一德国的基础，否则就保持德国的分裂”（法新社华盛顿电）。伦敦的观察家指出：美国今后将对英法施以压力，要它们“对苏联采取强硬政策到一种叫苏联很难满足西方要求的地步，这样使德国统一成为极不可能。”与此同时，阿登纳也疯狂地叫嚣要“解放东部”，扬言“需要实力”来达到“统一德国”和“统一欧洲”的目的。因此，阿登纳集团的重新登台，无疑的对德国的统一以及欧洲的和平都是一种严重的威胁。
    波恩的选举彻头彻尾地暴露了美国所一贯坚持的以举行“全德自由选举”作为解决德国问题的先决条件，是怎么一回事。现在人们可以看到，在美国的占领和干涉之下，在阿登纳的法西斯暴政统治之下，是根本不可能有什么“自由选举”的。美国所主张的所谓“全德自由选举”，实际上就是要将西德式的选举暴行强加在全德人民身上，就是要把阿登纳的统治扩展到全部德国，使整个德国都变为美国的附属国和军事基地。这与德国恢复成为一个统一、独立与和平的国家的目的是不相容的。事实证明，只有按照苏联的建议，由东西德议会与民主力量组成一个全德的临时政府，筹备选举，才能使德国人民在不受外国的干预之下实现德国的和平统一。
    阿登纳集团虽然保持了它的傀儡政权，但是它决不能阻止德国人民要求和平统一的崇高愿望的实现。正如马林科夫同志所指出的：“德国的命运掌握在德国人民手中。”西德人民在这次选举中更加认识到他们争取和平、统一与独立所应依循的正确道路，他们反对阿登纳集团卖国阴谋的斗争必将更勇猛地高涨起来。
