    Serious Waste in China Lantern Slide Company
    Reader Xing Diffei writes: The China Lantern Slide Company has serious waste issues. The company's production department warehouse is full of "rejects," with nearly six thousand catties of lantern slides, worth approximately 500 million yuan; many of these lantern slides should not have become rejects. For example, the "White Haired Girl" lantern slides printed in June this year, consisting of one hundred and twenty-one frames per set; because two or three frames were missing from a set, the rest were all treated as "rejects." The warehouse is now very damp, and some lantern slides have begun to mold and rot. The company's distribution group also has an inventory of more than 34,000 sets of lantern slides, worth more than 840 million yuan. The reason is that the slides were not printed in time. For example, the lantern slides promoting the Marriage Law were only printed when the campaign month for implementing the Marriage Law in various regions was about to end, resulting in them not being sold. When manufacturing lantern slide projectors, due to the carelessness of the cutters, more than 3,000 catties of iron sheets were wasted. In addition, more than twenty usable lantern slide projectors, because they had been left unused for a long time and looked a bit old, were smashed into scrap iron and sold. These two items alone wasted more than 50 million yuan of state property. The company's serious waste issues cannot continue. I request that the leading cadres of the China Lantern Slide Company inspect the above issues and handle them promptly.

    中国幻灯公司浪费现象严重
    读者邢涤非来信：中国幻灯公司浪费现象很严重。该公司制片部的仓库里堆满了“废品”，幻灯片数量近六千斤，价值约五亿元；这些幻灯片有许多不应该成为废品的。如今年六月印制的“白毛女”幻灯片，每套一百二十一幅；因为一套中少了两、三幅，其余就全部被作为“废品”了。现在仓库房很潮湿，有些幻灯片已开始发霉腐烂。该公司发行组也积压幻灯片三万四千多套，价值八亿四千多万元。原因是片子印制不及时，譬如宣传婚姻法的幻灯片，在各地贯彻婚姻法运动月将结束时才印制出来，以致卖不出去。在制造幻灯机时，由于剪裁的人漫不经心，浪费了铁片三千多斤。另外，有二十多架可用的幻灯机，因为搁置时间较长，样子有点旧了，该公司却把它捣成废铁出卖。这两项共浪费国家资财五千多万元。该公司这种严重浪费现象不能继续下去了。我要求中国幻灯公司的领导干部对上述问题进行检查，并及时处理。
