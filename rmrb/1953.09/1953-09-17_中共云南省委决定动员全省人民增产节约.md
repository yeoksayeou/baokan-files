[This Newspaper Dispatches] The CCP Yunnan Provincial Committee held an enlarged meeting on September 7th, deciding to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy throughout the province. The meeting studied the province's production income, savings, expenditures, and other aspects of the situation and conditions, and clearly recognized that as long as the people of all ethnic groups and cadres at all levels throughout the province actively take action, develop their wisdom, seize the key, and deeply explore the potential forces in production, they will certainly be able to successfully complete this year's national plan.
    The CCP Yunnan Provincial Committee instructed the relevant departments, commissions, and subordinate party committees at all levels, as well as various industrial and mining enterprises, to examine each item of income and expenditure this year, and formulate specific targets in order to mobilize the entire party and the people of the province to actively complete them. The Provincial Committee decided to conduct a widespread and in-depth mobilization throughout the province, and called on all people's organizations to work together and strive to launch a mass campaign to increase production and practice economy.
