Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 27th: On September 27th, sixty-five Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war were handed over to the Korean-Chinese side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. This is another group of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated, who risked their lives to break through the rule of a large number of Chiang and Rhee secret agents posing as prisoners of war, and returned to the embrace of the motherland.

　　When the returning Korean-Chinese prisoners of war were escorted by the Indian Custodial Forces to the temporary handover point in Panmunjom, they immediately accused Brigadier General Singh, Deputy Commander of the Indian Custodial Forces, Brigadier General Paneth and other personnel of the Indian Custodial Forces, as well as many journalists from both sides, of the heinous crimes committed by Chiang and Rhee secret agents in the prisoner-of-war camps of the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war under the direct arrangement and instruction of the U.S. military. These Korean-Chinese prisoners of war presented various material evidences, and listed the names of several Chiang and Rhee secret agents who are still carrying out such criminal activities. They described how the Chiang and Rhee secret agents persecuted the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camps under the custody of the U.S. and Rhee armies, and how, before some of the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war were about to be transferred to the custody of the Indian Custodial Forces, they strengthened the secret service organizations, and forced the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war to participate in training and exercises aimed at undermining the custody of the Indian Custodial Forces and the explanations of the Korean-Chinese representatives; how a large number of people pretended to be Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, carrying various deadly weapons, mixed into the prisoner-of-war camps under the custody of the Indian army, and continued to carry out their secret service rule in the camps; how they coerced, intimidated and monitored the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, making it impossible for them to request repatriation, and held them hostage to carry out various sabotage activities.

　　It is known to the world that the reason why the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" in the Armistice Agreement stipulates that non-directly repatriated prisoners of war should be released by the detaining party to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody by the Indian Custodial Forces is to ensure that every non-directly repatriated Korean-Chinese prisoner of war can be completely free from the control, threat and persecution of the U.S. military and the Chiang and Rhee secret agents, so that they can hear the explanations of the Korean-Chinese representatives regarding their repatriation rights without any interference or threat, and express their desire to return home. In order to ensure the faithful implementation of this basic provision, the Korean-Chinese side has twice strongly protested against the U.S. side for continuing to condone the Chiang and Rhee secret agents to carry out various criminal activities aimed at obstructing the repatriation of prisoners of war against the non-directly repatriated Korean-Chinese prisoners of war after the signing of the Armistice Agreement. They resolutely demanded that the U.S. side immediately stop such activities, thoroughly eliminate the secret agents, and no longer allow the Chiang and Rhee secret agents to pretend to be Korean-Chinese prisoners of war and mix into the prisoner-of-war camps under the custody of the Indian Custodial Forces. The facts have now proved that the U.S. side has not only failed to eliminate the secret agents, but has sent more secret agents to pretend to be Korean-Chinese prisoners of war and mix into the prisoner-of-war camps under the custody of the Indian Custodial Forces. Not only has it not stopped its criminal activities aimed at obstructing the repatriation of prisoners of war by means of force, but it is intensifying such activities. The Korean-Chinese people and the people of the world will never tolerate the situation in which the U.S. side uses Chiang and Rhee secret agents to seriously undermine the Armistice Agreement and the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

　　According to the arrangements of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the countries to which the prisoners of war belong will begin to conduct explanatory work to all prisoners of war affiliated to the countries to which they belong within ninety days starting from October 1st. Therefore, how to lift the serious secret service threat to which the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war under Indian custody are suffering, ensure the freedom and convenience of the Korean-Chinese representatives to carry out explanatory work, and ensure that the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war can listen to the explanations and apply for repatriation without any interference has become the primary task of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces.

    六十五名我志愿军被俘人员
    愤怒控诉美方利用蒋李特务迫害战俘罪行
    【新华社开城二十七日电】九月二十七日有六十五名中国人民志愿军被俘人员由中立国遣返委员会遣交朝中方面。这是陆续冒着生命的危险突破大批冒充战俘的蒋、李特务的统治，回到了祖国怀抱的又一批不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员。
    归来的上述朝中被俘人员，由印度看管部队护送到板门店的临时交接地点时，即向在场的印度看管部队副司令官辛格准将、旅长潘恩泰尔准将和其他印度看管部队人员以及双方的许多新闻记者，控诉在美军直接布置和指使下蒋、李特务在朝中被俘人员的战俘营内所犯的滔天罪行。这些朝中被俘人员拿出各种物证，并列举至今仍在进行此种罪恶活动的若干蒋、李特务的姓名，叙述了蒋、李特务如何在美李军队看管下的战俘营中，迫害朝中被俘人员，如何在若干朝中被俘人员即将被移交印度看管部队看管前，加强了特务组织，并强迫朝中被俘人员参加旨在破坏印度看管部队的看管与朝中代表的解释的训练与演习；如何大量冒充朝中被俘人员，携带各种足以致命的武器，混入印军看管下的战俘营，并在营内继续施行其特务统治；如何在胁迫、恐吓并监视朝中被俘人员，使之无法要求遣返，并挟持他们进行各种破坏活动。
    举世皆知：停战协定中“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”之所以规定应把不直接遣返的战俘从拘留一方释交中立国遣返委员会，以便印度看管部队看管，就是为了要保证每一个不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员，都能完全不再受美军及蒋、李特务的控制、威胁与迫害，使他们能够不受任何干扰与威胁地听到朝中代表有关他们遣返权利的解释，并表达他们要求回家的愿望。为了保证这一基本规定的忠实执行，朝中方面曾两度严重抗议美方于停战协定签字后，仍继续纵容蒋、李特务对不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员进行各种企图阻挠战俘遣返的罪恶活动，坚决要求美方立即停止这种活动，彻底清除特务，不得再以蒋、李特务冒充朝中被俘人员，混入印度看管部队看管下的战俘营。现在事实已经证明：美方不但没有清除特务，反而派来更多特务，冒充朝中被俘人员，混入印度看管部队看管下的战俘营。不但没有停止其旨在以武力威胁阻挠战俘遣返的罪恶活动，反而变本加厉地在进行这种活动。对于美方利用蒋、李特务严重破坏停战协定和“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的情况，决非朝中人民和全世界人民所能容忍。
    根据中立国遣返委员会的安排，战俘所属国家即将于十月一日开始在九十天内向一切依附于该所属国的战俘进行解释工作，因此，如何解除在印度看管下的朝中被俘人员所正遭受的严重特务威胁，保证朝中代表进行解释工作的自由与便利，保证朝中被俘人员得不受任何干扰地听取解释和申请遣返，已刻不容缓地成为中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队的首要任务。
