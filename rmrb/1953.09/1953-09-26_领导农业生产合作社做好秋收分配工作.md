Leading Agricultural Production Cooperatives to Do a Good Job in Autumn Harvest Distribution

The autumn harvest has begun in various places one after another, and agricultural production cooperatives are about to carry out autumn harvest distribution. This year, there are more than 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, several times more than last year. This situation shows that the influence of agricultural production cooperatives has expanded much more than last year. Hundreds of thousands of new members and those preparing to join, as well as the vast majority of mutual aid team members and individual farmers in the areas affected by the cooperatives, will observe its future from the results of the cooperative's distribution, and thus decide the path they will take. Therefore, doing a good job in the autumn harvest distribution of agricultural production cooperatives is not only a key to whether each agricultural production cooperative can be consolidated, but also a major issue related to whether the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement can develop smoothly.

What issues should be paid attention to in doing a good job in the autumn harvest distribution of agricultural production cooperatives?

Making the actual income of members as much as possible higher than before joining the cooperative, or at least striving not to be lower than the actual income before joining, is a very important issue that must be addressed in doing a good job in the autumn harvest distribution of agricultural production cooperatives. The only reason why farmers voluntarily organize or participate in cooperatives is that cooperatives can further meet their requirements for developing production and increasing income compared to mutual aid groups. Failure to develop production will certainly cause dissatisfaction among members; but even if production is good but dividends are not high, members will never be satisfied. The wheat yield of the Jia Zhenbin Cooperative in Malou Township, Lushan County, Henan Province, has increased year by year, but because the cooperative has a lot of loans and a large scale, the income of the members has decreased year by year. After the summer wheat harvest distribution this year, the members had many opinions, and some members cried and clamored to withdraw from the cooperative. This shows how important increasing the income of members is to consolidating agricultural production cooperatives; and there are still many agricultural production cooperatives similar to the Jia Zhenbin Cooperative in the country today. Among the 409 old and new agricultural production cooperatives in Rehe Province, 162 have large scale and many loans. According to a recent statistic in Changzhi Special District, Shanxi, 80 agricultural production cooperatives still have a lot of external debts due to incomplete correction of deviations. Some agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing blindly carried out construction, and the amount of loans reached more than 30% of the total income, and individual loans even accounted for 76% of the total income. If the amount due this year is repaid, the income of the members will be greatly reduced. In addition, many agricultural production cooperatives have poor management and waste a lot. This will also affect the income of the members.

In order to ensure the income of the members, the following issues should be paid attention to this year: First, the public accumulation fund should be appropriately calculated. This must be based on the existing economic strength of the agricultural production cooperative, carefully calculated, and resolutely avoid extravagance and waste. Livestock and farm tools that do not need to be added should not be added. Fertilizers that can be solved by accumulating coarse fertilizer should not be planned to buy fine fertilizer. In particular, those agricultural production cooperatives that have not increased production much and whose members cannot get much benefit should carefully calculate how much public accumulation fund should be retained. If the retention of the fund will reduce the income of the members, it is better not to retain it temporarily this year. Secondly, some of the work in the cooperative that is done for next year's production or cannot be profitable this year should be put into next year's production or later to distribute dividends with the consent of the members, so as not to reduce the income that the members should get this year. Third, for those cooperatives with excessive loans, if they can find ways to increase income and tighten expenses, and the calculation of the distribution results shows that the income of the members is still lower than before joining the cooperative, the local agricultural production leading organs should consult with relevant parties and allow them to postpone the payment of loans or pay them in installments to help them overcome difficulties.

Making all kinds of members in the cooperative (i.e., hired peasants, poor peasants, middle peasants, and well-to-do middle peasants who participate in the cooperative) obtain appropriate benefits in the autumn harvest distribution work is another key to consolidating and developing agricultural production cooperatives at present. Since agricultural production cooperatives are semi-socialist production organizations built on the basis of individual economy, distributing harvests is a very complex issue. In a cooperative, the amount of production investment of each member household (including land, draft animals, farm tools, funds, etc.), the amount of labor, the strength of labor, and the level of technology are different. Based on their own interests, the members have different requirements for distribution, and there are various contradictions in between. In distribution, we must take care of the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy and be good at regulating these contradictions. Last year, the price of means of production obtained in the autumn harvest distribution in some areas was too high, which damaged the enthusiasm of some members. This year, some areas have set the land remuneration too low, resulting in a decrease in the income of some members with more land and less labor, which is also not good. The principle of distribution must be fair and reasonable. The interests of land and labor, agriculture and sideline occupations should be taken into account. For harvests with different prices and different qualities, the actual needs of the members should also be taken into account, and reasonable adjustments and distributions should be made to satisfy everyone.

In leading the distribution work of agricultural production cooperatives, the original distribution ratio should be reviewed, and it should be based on the specific local conditions and the opinions of all members. If the members think that there are places that need to be revised, appropriate revisions should be made. In the distribution work, the calculation of labor remuneration is relatively complicated. According to the feedback from various places, many agricultural production cooperatives lack experience in management this year. In the calculation of workdays, there is no distinction between slack work and busy work, no distinction between agricultural work and sideline work, no distinction between technical work and ordinary work, and even individual cooperatives do not distinguish between public work and private work. As for the fact that the accounts are not accurate enough and the accounts are not announced on time, it is almost a common phenomenon. If these problems are not solved, the distribution work will be difficult to do well. Therefore, before the distribution, it is necessary to do a good job in clearing accounts and correctly calculating workdays, and to announce the accounts so that each member feels fair and reasonable. In addition, since the current cooperatives are still producing on relatively scattered small pieces of land, the quality of each piece of land is different, and the degree of processing and fertilization is also different. Therefore, the same crops in a cooperative have different qualities. In distribution, how to reasonably adjust the good and bad quality harvests so that the members do not get things that are too good or too bad is also an important issue to achieve fair and reasonable distribution. As for a cooperative with a variety of crops and different needs of each member household, attention should also be paid to satisfying the needs of the members as much as possible. In short, the fairness and rationality of distribution are reflected in many aspects. Only by carefully handling various issues and thinking from the reasonable demands of the members everywhere can the distribution work be done well. Now some agricultural production cooperatives think that the distribution work is too troublesome and advocate that "the income and expenditure of agricultural and sideline occupations should be divided by household, anyway, the meat rots in the pot." This view is wrong. It is true that there are many difficulties in carrying out a relatively reasonable distribution, and it is impossible to guarantee that there is not a single mistake in all calculations under today's conditions, but it must not be done carelessly to avoid trouble, so as to affect the unity of the members and the consolidation of the cooperative.

Achieving rapid and timely distribution is also a must-pay attention to the issue in the autumn harvest distribution. The members' annual large expenses are counting on the autumn harvest distribution. In addition, the history of the cooperatives is very short, and they lack conditions such as warehouse management. Therefore, in order to meet the needs of the members and avoid losses to the harvests, it is necessary to advocate distribution as soon as the harvest is collected, and the distribution should be completed in time after the autumn harvest is completed. Only by distributing properly as soon as possible can we immediately organize autumn plowing and autumn planting and winter production after the autumn harvest. Last year, some agricultural production cooperatives delayed the distribution until December, which made the members very dissatisfied and caused many troubles in advance payments and borrowings, and the grain also suffered losses. This lesson should be remembered. In order to achieve timely distribution, the organs and cadres leading the mutual aid and cooperation work in various places must immediately take action to lead each cooperative in the local area to do all the necessary preparatory work such as calculating income and expenditure, clarifying accounts, and evaluating work points. Last year, some cooperatives adopted the method of trial distribution before the autumn, which made the distribution work prepared and orderly, and the result was very good. This year, some cooperatives have done a good job in preparing distribution plans before the autumn harvest, which is also good. This method is to preliminarily estimate the agricultural and sideline income of the cooperative, deduct the production investment and necessary expenses, and calculate the distribution amount of each standard mu and each workday and the preliminary total income of each member according to the distribution ratio of land and labor. The distribution is carried out accordingly during the autumn harvest. When estimating the total income of the cooperative, it is slightly lower than the actual income, and the final amount is made up when the distribution is completed. In areas with a late autumn harvest, the distribution preparation can be done in accordance with this method now.

### 领导农业生产合作社做好秋收分配工作

    领导农业生产合作社做好秋收分配工作
    各地秋收已先后开始，农业生产合作社就要进行秋收分配。今年全国共有农业生产合作社一万多个，比去年增加了数倍。这个情况说明农业生产合作社的影响已比去年扩大得多。数十万户新入社和准备入社的人，以及在合作社影响所及地区的广大互助组员和个体农民，都要从合作社分配的结果来观察它的前途，从而决定他们自己要走的道路。因此，做好农业生产合作社的秋收分配工作，不仅是关系着每一个农业生产合作社能否巩固的主要关键，而且是关系着整个互助合作运动能否顺利发展的重大问题。
    做好农业生产合作社的秋收分配工作应注意那些问题呢？
    尽可能使社员的实际收入较入社前有所增加，至少也要争取不低于入社前的实际收入，这是做好农业生产合作社秋收分配工作必须注意解决的十分重要的问题。农民所以自愿组织或参加合作社，唯一的原因就是合作社比互助组能进一步满足他发展生产、增加收入的要求。生产不能发展当然会引起社员的不满；但只是生产好而分红不多，社员也决不会满意。河南省鲁山县马楼乡贾振彬社小麦产量逐年增加，但因为社内贷款多、摊子大，社员收入反而逐年下降。今年夏季麦收分配以后，社员意见很多，有的社员哭着闹着出社了。由此可见增加社员收入对巩固农业生产合作社是多么重要；而与贾振彬社相类似的农业生产合作社，今天在全国还为数不少。热河省新老农业生产合作社四百零九个，其中就有一百六十二个摊子大、贷款多。山西长治专区最近统计，有八十个农业生产合作社，因纠偏不彻底还有不少外债。北京郊区有些农业生产合作社因盲目进行建设，贷款数目达到总收入百分之三十以上，个别的贷款竟占总收入百分之七十六，如归还了今年应还款数，社员的收入就会大大减少。另外，许多农业生产合作社因经营管理不善，浪费很大。这也将使社员的收入受到影响。
    为了保证社员的收入，今年应注意以下几个问题：首先应该适当地计算公积金，这必须从农业生产合作社内现有的经济力量出发，精打细算，切实避免铺张浪费。牲畜、农具能够不增添的就不要增添，肥料能够用积粗肥办法解决的就不要计划买细肥。特别是那些增产不太多、社员还不能得到多少好处的农业生产合作社，更要仔细计算，公积金能留多少就留多少，如留了社员收入就要减少，宁可今年暂时不留。其次，社内有一些工是为明年生产做的或是今年还不能获利的应征求社员同意，放在明年的生产中或以后去分红，以免减少今年社员应得的收入。再次，那些贷款过多的社，如想办法增加收入，紧缩开支以后，计算分配结果社员所得仍然低于入社前的，当地农业生产领导机关应和有关方面商量，酌量允许它们缓缴贷款或分期缴还，帮助它们渡过困难。
    在秋收分配工作中使社内各种成员（即参加合作社的雇农、贫农、中农、富裕中农）都得到适当的利益，这是目前巩固、发展农业生产合作社的另一个主要关键。由于农业生产合作社是建立在个体经济基础上的半社会主义性质的生产组织，分配收获物是
  一个很复杂的问题。一个社里，各户社员的生产投资多少（包括土地、耕畜、农具、资金等）、劳力多少、劳力强弱、技术高低各不相同，社员基于自己的利益，对分配的要求也各不相同，这中间就存在各种各样的矛盾。在分配时，我们必须照顾小农经济的特点，善于调节这些矛盾。去年有的地区秋收分配结果，生产资料所取得的代价太高，损伤了一部分社员的积极性；今年有的地区又把土地报酬订得过低，结果使一些土地较多劳力较少的社员收入减少了，这也是不好的。分配的原则必须做到公平合理。土地与劳力、农业与副业等方面的利益均需兼顾；对不同价格不同质量的收获物，也要照顾社员的实际需要，加以合理地调剂分配，做到人人满意。
    在领导农业生产合作社的分配工作当中，应该审查一下原订的分配比例，要根据当地的具体情况和全体社员的意见办事，如社员认为有需要修改的地方应作适当修改。在分配工作中，劳动报酬的计算是比较复杂的，根据各地的反映，今年许多农业生产合作社因为缺乏经营管理的经验，在劳动日的计算上，有闲工与忙工不分、农业活与副业活不分、技术活与普通活不分，甚至个别社还有公活与私活不分的现象。至于账目记的不够精确，不按期公布账目差不多是相当普遍的现象。如果这些问题不解决，分配工作就很难做好。所以在分配以前，要做好清理账目和正确计算劳动日的工作，要公布账目，使每个社员都感到公平合理。另外，由于目前的合作社还是在比较分散的小块土地上进行生产，各块土地质量有所不同，加上加工施肥的程度也各不相同，所以一个社里的同种作物，质量就有好坏的不同，在分配时，如何把质量好的和差的收获物都作到合理调剂，不使社员们得到的东西偏好偏坏，也是达到分配公平合理的一个重要问题。至于一个社有多种作物，各户社员的需要有所不同，也应注意尽量满足社员的需要。总之，分配的公平合理是表现在多方面的，只有认真仔细地处理各种问题，处处根据社员意见，从社员的合理要求着想，才能把分配工作做好。现在有一些农业生产合作社因为嫌分配工作太麻烦，主张“农业副业收入和开支按户一分就行了，反正肉烂在锅里”。这种主张是错误的。要进行比较合理的分配的确有不少困难，各项计算要保证完全没有一点错误，在今天的条件下也是不可能的，但决不能因避免麻烦而马虎了事，以影响社员的团结和社的巩固。
    做到分配迅速及时，也是秋收分配中的一个必须注意的问题。社员们一年一度较大量的开支都指望着秋收分配，加之合作社的历史很短，缺乏仓库保管等条件，因此为了满足社员的需要和避免收获物遭受损失，应提倡随收随分，秋收完毕分配也及时完毕。也只有及早分配停当了，才便于在秋收之后立即组织秋耕秋种和冬季生产。去年有的农业生产合作社拖迟到十二月份还没有分配，使社员很不满意，并引起许多预支预借的麻烦，粮食也遭受了损失。这个教训应该记取。要做到分配及时，各地领导互助合作工作的机关和干部就要立即行动起来，领导本地的各个社做好收支计算、澄清账目、评好工分等一切必要的准备工作。去年有的社采取在秋前事先进行试分的办法，使分配工作进行得有准备、有秩序，结果很好，今年有些社在秋收前做好分配方案的作法也是好的。这个办法是把社内农副业收入初步加以估计，扣除生产投资及必要开支以后，按土地劳力分配比例算出每一标准亩及每一劳动日的分配量和每一社员的初步总收入。秋收时即照此进行分配。在估计全社总收入时比实际收入稍低一些，分配完毕时最后补齐。在秋收较晚的地区，现在就可仿照这个办法做好分配准备。
