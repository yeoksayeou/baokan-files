Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: Associated Press news feature writer Warren Bennett admitted that it has become increasingly difficult for the United States to maintain its control in the capitalist world and to implement its aggression plans.

In a dispatch issued by the Associated Press on August 29, Bennett said that for many years the United States has always "told its allies what to do... The allies obeyed." But he admitted that the United States' position of command has been severely shaken due to the Soviet Union's unwavering pursuit of a peaceful policy and the beginning of a trend towards easing international tensions. He said that among many countries, there is now a trend of "resisting what they call American control."

Bennett said: "The two largest Western allies, the United States and Britain, have clashed over whether India should participate in the Korean peace conference. Even before the conference was held, the two countries had policy splits. This may indicate how difficult it will be to maintain Western harmony."

Bennett then expressed anxiety about the political situation in France and Italy, the two main vassal states of the United States in continental Europe. He pointed out that in Italy, the pro-American Gasperi regime has collapsed, and "now Italy, like France, has entered a period of shaky government." He said that a recent major strike movement in France "weakened France." He was particularly disturbed by the fact that both important continental countries have "communist parties with large numbers of members." He is also worried about the fate of Adenauer, the main supporter of the United States in West Germany, in the elections scheduled for September 6.

Bennett's dispatch also revealed that the United States faces more than just these difficulties. He pointed out that the dispute between Egypt and Britain "undermines anti-communist defense work in this crucial region"; and that France's exile of the Sultan of Morocco "does nothing to improve the already existing tensions between the Arab world and the West."

Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: TASS, New York, September 2nd: "U.S. News & World Report"'s correspondent in London wrote an article on Anglo-American contradictions. He wrote:

"Distrust of American claims on how to deal with communists (the magazine refers to people's democratic countries this way – editor) is growing rapidly in Britain. Differences between the two major Western powers have been apparent for months, and have become more acute with the end of the Korean War and the Russians mastering the hydrogen bomb.

Now, the British are more convinced than ever that they are right and the Americans are wrong. Criticism of the United States is being conducted openly or semi-openly in the United Nations and elsewhere...

The reason is a widespread desire for peace. Churchill is convinced that for the future of Britain, it is necessary to ease tensions with Russia and Communist China. His staff reminded him that military spending should be reduced. So Britain is continuing to try to get Communist China into the United Nations and hopes to seek a solution to world problems at a summit meeting of Britain, the the US, Russia (and France if necessary)."

The article also said: "The fact is that now that the Korean armistice has been achieved, commercial interest groups are exerting great pressure. They foresee that if Britain does not take goods that have not been taken to the Chinese market so far for military reasons, Japan and Germany will take that market."

Xinhua News Agency: New York dispatch: New York "Herald Tribune" columnist Stuart Alsop fears that the United States' control over Britain cannot continue. In an article from London, he said that the British are now "filled with that new sense of being able to be completely independent. Because this has happened, the most convenient tool of American policy - Britain's dependence on American economic aid - hardly exists anymore."

Alsop pointed out that in this new situation, if the United States continues to regard Britain as a "beggar" and ignores its wishes, it "will be absolutely fatal" to the Anglo-American "alliance."

    美联社记者承认美国越来越难推行侵略计划
    纽约“先驱论坛报”担心美国难以继续控制英国
    【新华社四日讯】美联社新闻特稿作者华伦·贝奈特承认美国已经越来越难于保持它在资本主义世界中的控制地位，越来越难于推行它的侵略计划。
    贝奈特在美联社八月二十九日发的一篇电讯中说，多年来美国总是“告诉它的盟国应该怎么做。……盟国是听命的。”但是他承认，美国这种发号施令的地位，由于苏联始终不渝地执行和平政策和国际紧张局势的开始趋于缓和，而发生了严重的动摇。他说，许多国家当中现在产生了一种“抗拒它们所称的美国的控制”的趋势。
    贝奈特说：“西方两个最大的盟国美国和英国，已经在是否应让印度参加朝鲜和平会议的问题上发生争执。甚至在这个会议召开之前，两国就发生了政策分裂。这可能表明：要维持西方的和谐将是多么困难的事。”
    贝奈特然后又对美国在欧洲大陆上两个主要仆从国家法国和意大利国内的政治情况表示焦急。他指出，在意大利，亲美的加斯贝利政权已经垮台，“现在意大利像法国一样，进入了一个政府摇摇欲坠的时期”。他说，法国最近发生的一次大罢工运动“削弱了法国”。他特别对这两个重要大陆国家里都有“党员众多的共产党”这个事实表示不安。他也对美国在西德的主要支持者阿登纳在定于九月六日举行的大选中的命运感到担心。
    贝奈特的电讯还透露出，美国感到棘手的事还不止此。他指出：埃及和英国发生的争端，“使这个举足轻重的地区中反共的防务工作受到损害”；而法国放逐摩洛哥素勒檀，“对于阿拉伯和西方之间已经存在的紧张关系也没有什么好处”。
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社纽约二日讯：“美国新闻与世界报道”驻伦敦记者写了一篇文章，谈到英美矛盾。他写道：
    “英国对于美国在如何对付共产党（该杂志这样称呼人民民主国家——编者）问题上的主张的不信任情绪正在迅速增长。两大西方国家之间的分歧数月来已经十分明显，而由于朝鲜战争的结束和俄国人掌握了氢弹更突然趋于尖锐化。
    现在，英国人比以往更加相信，他们是对的，美国人错了。在联合国和其他地方，对美国的批评在公开地，或半公开地进行。……
    其原因是普遍的对于和平的渴望。邱吉尔确信，为了英国的前途，需要缓和与俄国和共产党中国的紧张关系。他的参谋们提醒他军费开支应该减少。所以英国在继续设法使共产党中国加入联合国，并希望在英、美、俄（如果必要再加上法国）的最高级会议上谋取世界问题的解决。”
    文章还说：“事实是，在现在朝鲜停战已经实现的时候，商业利益集团发出了很大的压力。他们预见到，如果英国再不把迄今出于军事考虑没有拿去的货物拿到中国市场上去，日本和德国就会占去那个市场了。”
    【新华社讯】纽约消息：纽约“先驱论坛报”专栏作家斯图尔特·艾尔索普担心美国对英国的控制关系难以继续。他在发自伦敦的一篇文章中说，英国人现在“充满着那种已经能够完全独立的新的感觉。就是因为出现了这种情况，美国政策最方便的工具——英国对美国经济援助的依赖性——几乎不再存在了。”
    艾尔索普指出，在这一新的情况下，如果美国再把英国看作是一个“叫花子”而不理睬它的愿望的话，对于美英“联盟”来说，“将是绝对的致命伤”。
