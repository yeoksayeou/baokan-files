The people in wheat-producing areas such as Henan, Hebei, and Shandong are simultaneously draining waterlogged areas and preparing intensively for wheat planting.

In Henan Province, most of the waterlogging in affected areas was drained by the end of August, and the flooded fields are suitable for planting wheat. Currently, the People's Government has prepared more than 100 million jin of wheat seeds, which have been distributed to various counties and sold or lent by economic departments. To ensure uniform emergence, seed germination tests have been conducted in various places, and the masses have been mobilized to select good varieties and inspect self-retained wheat seeds. Since the summer, a manure accumulation campaign has been launched. Puyang, Xinxiang, Anyang and other three special districts have accumulated base fertilizer averaging 1,500 to 2,000 jin per mu. Cooperatives have also prepared a large amount of fertilizer to support autumn planting.

The Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry held a wheat yield increase conference in mid-August to study the reasons for the increase or decrease in wheat production, the technology of increasing production, and emphasized the importance of drainage, fertilizer accumulation, and material supply to ensure the completion of the wheat yield increase plan. After the meeting, specific arrangements were made in various places. First, a fertilizer accumulation campaign continued throughout the province. According to estimates from 39 counties, the general amount of accumulated fertilizer can reach more than 1,000 jin per mu of wheat field, and more than 2,000 jin in mountainous areas. In Raoyang and other four counties of the Dingxian Special District, 870,000 carts and more than 60,000 loads of fertilizer have been accumulated, and about two carts of fertilizer can be applied to each mu of wheat field. The province has also prepared more than 100 million jin of commercial fertilizer and issued fertilizer loans of more than 40 billion yuan. In terms of seeds, in addition to mobilizing the masses to exchange good varieties, the People's Government has also supplied about 100 million jin of wheat seeds and issued wheat seed loans of more than 100 billion yuan. Agents for seed dressing for 12 million mu of wheat fields and for controlling underground pests in 6 million mu of wheat fields are also ready and will be supplied to farmers at low prices, on credit, or free of charge, depending on the situation. The wheat planting season in the province is approaching. Party and government organs in the waterlogged areas are vigorously leading the masses to drain water and reclaim land. It is estimated that 70% of the waterlogged land in the province can be drained and planted with wheat before wheat planting. The area of wheat planted in the province this year is expected to expand to 35 million to 36 million mu.

In Shandong Province, the waterlogging has been drained relatively quickly in most areas. Except for a few low-lying areas, there is currently no waterlogging in Laiyang and Jiaozhou Special Districts. Except for 50,000 mu of low-lying land and a part of the detention area, Taian Special District can ensure timely wheat planting. The masses in some severely affected areas have stabilized their emotions after receiving relief and condolences from the People's Government, and are also actively draining water and preparing for wheat planting. Some areas in the southern Linyi, Jining and other special districts have drought conditions. Farmers are taking advantage of the morning and evening moisture to cultivate the land, or implement harrowing before plowing. In terms of fertilizer, according to statistics from seven special districts and one county, more than 170 million jin of autumn planting fertilizers, such as cake fertilizer, chemical fertilizer, and miscellaneous fertilizer, have been prepared. More than 750,000 jin of agricultural medicine have also been prepared. Jining, Changwei, and Taian Special Districts have also prepared more than 5,700 waterwheels and 5,800 walking plows for lending and sale. The masses have been mutually assisting and exchanging wheat seeds in the disaster-stricken areas lacking wheat seeds. The government has also prepared some seeds and loans to support farmers in difficulty. It is estimated that the difficulty of autumn planting wheat seeds can be basically solved. To strengthen technical guidance for wheat planting, the province and some special districts have held meetings to study the experience of increasing wheat production. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has also sent cadres to study autumn planting technology and the use of new walking plows and chemical fertilizers, and to go to key areas to create experience in planting wheat well.

The problems existing in autumn planting in the above areas are, first of all, the slow progress of drainage in some areas, which hinders wheat planting. This is mainly because there is no unified control of water conditions and unified leadership of drainage. Some places have upper drainage and lower blockage, causing conflicts. All localities should quickly negotiate and solve disputes specifically according to the principles of downstream obeying upstream, upstream taking care of downstream, and preventing the relocation of water damage, to accelerate the progress of drainage work. Secondly, the shortage of fertilizer is still a serious problem in many areas. In addition to the government and economic departments continuing to make great efforts to supply it, all localities should also find ways to solve it according to the principle of obtaining materials locally and supplying them locally, and mobilize the masses to solve it by themselves. In addition, some disaster-stricken areas have masses selling livestock due to living difficulties or lack of feed. Local People's Governments should also pay attention to care and assistance.

    河南河北山东人民政府积极帮助农民
    大力准备种麦所需物资
    河南、河北、山东等产麦地区人民与排除积水同时，正紧张准备种麦工作。
    河南省受涝地区，在八月底已把积水大部排出，受涝的田地都可种麦。现在人民政府准备的一亿多斤麦种已经分配到各县，由经济部门分别出售或贷放。为保证出苗整齐，各地进行了种籽发芽试验，并发动群众选用良种和检查自留麦种。从夏季开展积肥运动以来，濮阳、新乡、安阳等三个专区已经积攒了平均每亩地够上一千五百斤至二千斤的基肥。合作社也准备了大量肥料支持秋种。
    河北省农林厅在八月中旬召开了小麦增产会议，研究了小麦增产减产的原因，增产的技术，并强调要做好排水、积肥及物资供应等工作，从各方面保证小麦增产计划的完成。会后各地都作了具体安排。首先在全省范围内继续开展了积肥运动。据三十九个县的估计，一般积肥量每亩麦田可达千斤以上，山区可达两千斤以上。定县专区饶阳等四县已积肥八十七万车又六万多驮，每亩麦田可施肥两车左右。全省并已准备了一亿多斤商品肥料，发放肥料贷款四百余亿元。种籽方面，除发动群众互换良种外，人民政府并供应麦种约一亿斤，发放麦种贷款一千多亿元。可供一千二百万亩麦田种籽拌种和六百万亩麦田除治地下虫害的药剂，也已准备就绪，将按不同情况以低价、赊销、免费等办法供应农民。现在该省种麦季节已经迫近，内涝地区党政机关正在大力领导群众排水脱地，据估计，到种麦前该省有百分之七十的受涝地都可脱水种麦。该省今年种麦面积，可望扩大到三千五百万亩至三千六百万亩。
    山东省大部地区内涝排除较快。莱阳、胶州两专区目前除个别洼地外已无积水。泰安专区除五万亩洼地和一部分滞洪区外，都可保证适时种麦。部分受灾较重地区的群众，受到人民政府的救济和慰问后，情绪已经稳定，也在积极排水，准备种麦。南部临沂、济宁等专区有些地区有旱象，农民正在趁早晚地潮时耕地，或实行先耙后耕。肥料方面，据七个专区和一个县的统计，现已准备好饼肥、化学肥料和杂肥等秋种肥料一亿七千多万斤。农用药剂也准备了七十五万多斤。济宁、昌潍、泰安三专区并准备了水车五千七百多部和步犁五千八百多部进行贷卖。各受灾地区缺乏的麦种，群众已进行了互济互换，政府并准备了一部分种籽和贷款支持困难的农户，估计秋种麦种困难，可以基本解决。为加强种麦技术指导，省和部分专区曾召开会议研究了小麦增产经验。省农林厅并抽派干部学习秋种技术及新式步犁、化学肥料的用法，分赴重点地区，创造种好小麦的经验。
    以上各地在秋种中存在的问题，首先是还有一些地区排水进度缓慢，妨碍了种麦工作。这主要是因为没有统一掌握水情和统一领导排水，有的地方上排下堵，发生矛盾。各地应迅速协商，根据下游服从上游、上游照顾下游、防止水害搬家的原则，具体解决纠纷，以加速排水工作的进度。其次是不少地区肥料缺乏的情况还比较严重，除政府和经济部门继续大力设法供应外，各地还要根据就地取材、就地供应的原则设法解决，并发动群众自行解决。此外，有些受灾地区群众有因生活困难或缺乏饲料而出卖牲畜的，当地人民政府也应注意照顾和扶助。
