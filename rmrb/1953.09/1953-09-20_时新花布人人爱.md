Everyone Loves Fashionable Printed Cloth
Ruò Lán

The needs of the people are changing
As the national production undertakings develop, the living standards and purchasing power of the broad masses of working people in urban and rural areas have generally improved. They have gradually become more particular about their clothing. The old, plain patterns of several years ago can no longer meet the growing needs of the people's lives. Since liberation, the varieties and colors of cotton cloth have continuously developed and changed along with the gradual increase in consumer purchasing power. From the perspective of the types of varieties sold in Hunan Province from 1950 to the second half of 1952: In 1950, the proportion of white cloth and colored cloth was almost the same, but by 1952, colored cloth had increased to about twice that of white cloth. Comparing the first half of 1953 with the same period in 1952, white cloth decreased by 48 percent, while printed cloth increased by 100 percent.

During this year's peak season for printed cloth sales, when the broad masses of working people needed to choose their favorite patterns to make new clothes, many printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, mainly state-owned printing and dyeing factories, produced light-colored printed cloth that was not popular and was heavily stockpiled in warehouses or lying in the glass windows of cloth stores. At that time, state-owned printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai alone had stockpiled more than 80,000 bolts. People took one look at these printed fabrics and said, "The patterns are old, and the colors are not bright." Some shook their heads and said, "The patterns are too old-fashioned and outdated." A batch of light-colored cloth purchased by Shanghai Tongshengxiang Cloth Store from the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation three years ago still remains on display. Some patterns in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places are still designed from more than a decade ago, repeating the same old designs year after year. Cadres at the Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory used to think that the main sales targets for these printed fabrics were rural women, who did not have high demands, so they did not seek to improve the colors. Later, when they sent people to collect opinions from consumers in various cities and towns and rural women, they realized that this was not the case. What they wanted were popular "sparrow-stepping on plum blossoms," "mandarin ducks playing with lotus," "phoenix and peony," "hundred children" and other large floral prints, as well as "small cherry," "small polka dot" and other delicate small floral prints, plaid fabrics, etc. They did not want the old-fashioned printed cloth with red flowers and green leaves. An employee in Shanghai who used to work on printed fabric pattern design said, "Since liberation, the people's living standards have generally improved, and the market has prospered, but there has been no improvement in textiles and dyeing, especially the patterns are still the same old ones, which of course cannot meet the needs of the people."

Strive for Improvement in Variety, Pattern, and Quality
Since the National Textile Quality Conference was held in Shanghai in June this year to study how to improve the variety, pattern, and quality of printed cloth, production departments and sales departments in various places have actively tried to improve the shortcomings in production and sales. The Xi'an Municipal Textile, Yarn and Cloth Company conducted an in-depth understanding of the local commodity needs, re-compiled the variety plan, reduced the varieties that did not sell well by 80 percent, and increased the varieties with novel patterns and colors by 80 percent. In addition, it is also planned to increase more than 40 kinds of fashionable printed fabrics loved by the masses. The sales volume of improved floral gabardine, floral tribute cloth, and floral fine twill cloth in July and August this year increased by more than double compared with the same period last year. In Shanghai, the work in design, production, and sales has been greatly improved. The staff of these three departments checked their shortcomings through criticism and self-criticism and strengthened the liaison system. Design staff participated in the work of the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation to select patterns, and also worked with the staff of the Processing Section of the East China Textile Administration Bureau twice a week to understand the sales situation in the market, absorb the opinions of the masses, and improve the pattern design in a timely manner. Printing and dyeing factories have also stopped using sluggish pigments that affect the color, and try to pay attention to bright colors when mixing and dyeing. There have also been improvements in packaging. In order to improve the quality of gauze, the Shanghai textile system has begun to pilot new textile and printing and dyeing quality standards in a focused manner in late August. The technical departments of these factories are studying ways to improve various major shortcomings that have been discovered, from technical measures, operating methods, machine maintenance, and other aspects. The workers of the Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory are currently studying how to make the colors of printed cloth and colored cloth more washable and sun-resistant, and the base cloth stronger. Since the beginning of August, all employees of the state-owned Qingdao Printing and Dyeing Factory have actively launched a major quality inspection campaign. The workers' slogan is: "Improve quality and meet the needs of farmers for all kinds of printed cloth that has colorfastness, new patterns, does not shrink, and has great tensile strength." This has set off a production competition. All the technical staff of the engineer's office have also gone deep into the workshops separately. The engraving department, which is responsible for making floral boards, used to be able to make only sixteen sets of floral boards per month. After improving the working methods, it can produce ten sets in half a month. In order to diversify the colors of the printed fabrics, the workers in the printing and dyeing workshop overcame various technical difficulties and increased the original five base colors of the printed fabrics to seven, and improved the mixing method and the base color construction method, thus making the colors of various printed fabrics more vivid and durable.

Large Quantities of Printed Cloth for Autumn and Winter Use are Gradually on the Market
Printing and dyeing factories in various places are currently rushing to produce a large number of sturdy and beautiful cloths for autumn and winter use to supply the vast number of farmers. According to the preferences of farmers, the state-owned Qingdao Printing and Dyeing Factory selected the patterns and colors of cloth for autumn and winter use, and began mass production in July. It was decided to produce various novel and beautiful printed cloth and colored cloth, including large floral gabardine with magpies playing with plum blossoms, groups of chickens teasing each other, mandarin ducks playing with lotus, and parrot and grape patterns, which are specially for making quilt covers, and more than forty kinds of plaid printed cloth and small printed cloth for making clothing materials. These small printed cloths are designed by art designers based on the scene of this year's rural harvest, drawing various floral cloth patterns of crops, including golden wheat ears, orange-yellow corn, light green Chinese cabbage, purple eggplants, and bright red peppers. In addition, there are patterns drawn with fruits such as apples, pears, and cherries as themes. The printed fabrics designed by Shanghai printing and dyeing factories based on patterns that are popular among the people have been transported to all parts of the country. These new dark-colored printed fabrics have folk colors and are most popular among farmers in various places. They are sold out as soon as they leave the factory. In July, the art staff of the Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory carried product samples and went deep into various places to understand the needs of the masses, and collected many folk art works such as paper-cuts and embroideries from the masses in various places for future reference when designing patterns. Now, the cloth that the masses love to use in autumn and winter is being rushed to produce in large quantities.

Tens of millions of bolts of printed cloth and colored cloth that have been printed and processed are being transported to rural areas across the country by trains and ships.

    时新花布人人爱
    若蓝
    人民的需要在变化
    随着国家生产事业的发展，城乡广大劳动人民的生活水平和购买力普遍提高了，他们对衣着也就渐渐地讲究起来，若干年前那些老式的平淡的花样，已经不能满足人民生活日益增长的需要。解放以来，棉布的品种和花色，是随着消费者购买力的逐渐增长不断地发展和变化着的。从湖南全省一九五○年到一九五二年下半年销售品种的类别来看：一九五○年，白布和色布所占的比例相差无几，到一九五二年，色布即增长到为白布的二倍左右了。一九五三年上半年与一九五二年同期比较，白布下降了百分之四十八，花布却上升了百分之百。
    今年花布旺销的季节，广大劳动人民正需要选择自己所喜爱的花样来做新衣服的时候，而上海、天津、青岛等地很多印染厂，主要是国营印染厂，所出产的浅色花布不受人欢迎，大量积压在仓库里或躺在布店的玻璃橱窗里。当时国营上海印染各厂在仓库里就积压了八万多匹。人们一望这些花布，就说：“花样老一套，花色不鲜艳。”有的看了摇摇头说：“花样太老式，过时了。”上海同盛祥布店三年前向花纱布公司购进的浅色布，到现在有很多还睡在橱窗里。上海、天津、青岛等地有些花样还是十几年以前设计的，年年搬老一套。天津印染厂的干部原来一向认为这些花布主要销售对象是农村妇女，她们要求不高，因此不求花色的改进。后来，他们派人到各城镇的消费者和广大农村妇女中征集意见时，才知并不是那么回事。她们要求的却是目前流行的“雀蹬梅”、“鸳鸯戏莲”、“凤凰牡丹”、“百子图”等大花布和“小樱桃”、“小圆点”等各种花样细巧的小花布、方格布等。并不要那种红花绿叶老一套的花布。上海一个曾从事花布图案打样的工作人员说：“解放后，人民的生活普遍提高了，市场也繁荣了，但在纺织物和印染方面没有跟着改进，尤其是图案还是老一套，这当然不能满足人民的需要了。”
    从品种、花样、质量上求改进
    自今年六月间，在上海召开的全国纺织质量会议，研究了如何改进花布的品种花样和质量以后，各地生产部门和销售部门都积极设法改进产销中的缺点。西安市花纱布公司对当地的商品需要情况进行了深入的了解，重新编制了品种计划，把不合销路的品种减少了百分之八十，花样、色泽新颖的品种增加了百分之八十。另外，还计划增加四十多种群众喜爱的时新花色布匹。经过改进的花哔叽、花贡呢、花细斜等布，今年七、八月间的销售量比去年同期增加一倍以上。在上海设计、生产和销售三个方面的工作，有了很大改进。这三个部门的工作人员通过批评与自我批评，检查缺点，加强了联系制度。设计工作人员参加了花纱布公司评选花样的工作，并且会同华东纺织管理局加工科人员每周两次到市场了解销售情况，吸收群众意见，及时改进花样设计。印染厂也已停止使用影响色泽的呆滞颜料，在配料和印染时，尽量地注意色彩鲜艳。包装方面也已有了改进。为了提高纱布质量，上海纺织系统在八月下旬已开始有重点地试行新的纺织、印染质量标准。这些厂的技术部门正针对已发现的各种主要缺点，从技术措施、操作方法、机器检修等各方面来研究改进办法。上海第一印染厂的职工们目前正在研究怎样使花布、色布的颜色更加耐洗、耐晒，底子布更加结实。国营青岛印染厂的全体职工，从八月初旬起，积极地展开了质量大检查运动。工人们的口号是：“提高质量，满足农民弟兄需要的各种花色牢、花样新、不缩水、拉力大的花布”。掀起了生产竞赛。工程师室的全体技术人员，也分头深入车间。负责制作花板的雕刻部，过去每月只能做十六套花板，经改进工作法后，半个月就能出十套。印染车间的职工为了使花布样色多样化，他们克服了种种技术上的困难，从原来的五种花布底色，增加到七种，并改进了配料方法和底色施工方法，因而使各种花布的色泽更加鲜明耐牢。
    大批秋冬穿用的花布陆续上市
    各地印染厂目前正赶制大量坚固美观的各种秋冬季用布，供应广大农民。国营青岛印染厂根据农民的爱好，选定了秋冬季用布的花样和色泽，从七月份开始即大量生产。决定生产各种新颖美观的花布、色布，其中有喜鹊闹梅、群鸡相逗、鸳鸯戏荷和鹦鹉葡萄图等专供做被面用的大花哔叽，有四十余种供做衣服料用的方格花布和小花布。这些小花布由美术设计人员根据今年农村丰收的情景，绘制各种农作物的花布图案，包括金黄的麦穗、橙黄的玉米、嫩绿的大白菜、紫色的茄子和鲜红的辣椒等。此外还有以苹果、梨、樱桃等果类为题材绘制的图案，上海各印染厂根据民间喜闻乐见的图案设计的花布，有的已运销全国各地，这些新的深色花布都带有民间色彩，最受各地农民的欢迎，一出厂就全部销光了。天津印染厂美术人员在七月间携带产品样本，深入各地了解群众的要求后，并向各地群众搜集了许多剪纸、刺绣等民间艺术作品，以备今后设计花样时作为参考。现在，秋冬季群众喜爱的用布正大量赶制中。
    目前已经印染加工完毕的成千万匹花布和色布，正由火车和船只运往各地农村。
