    Quickly Resolve the Difficulty of Insufficient Animal Power for Some Farmers in Autumn Plowing and Sowing
    Li Mingyao and Chen Chu, Communist Party of China, Chongning County, Sichuan Province, write: In Erxiang Village, Wanshou Township, Chongning County, there is a severe shortage of cattle power for autumn plowing and sowing this year.

    This village has more than 1,500 mu of paddy fields. During the spring plowing season, there were only about 30 head of cattle, and the cattle power was already insufficient. At that time, cattle from neighboring villages were borrowed to transplant the seedlings. After transplanting, some families in the village sold strong cattle and replaced them with young cattle, and some fed cattle jointly with other villages. As a result, the cattle power was greatly weakened. Why did this phenomenon occur? There are three main reasons: First, there is a shortage of fodder, and the price of grass is high, which puts a heavy burden on cattle owners. With the improvement of the rural economy, many farmers are building new houses and pigsties, so the price of grass has increased, and cattle farmers are unwilling to raise cattle. Second, everyone doesn't cherish jointly raised cattle. The method of jointly raising cattle in the village is to feed them in rotation without a dedicated person in charge, which leads to the phenomenon of "only using the 'hard-working cattle' during busy months, and no one cares about them during idle months," making the cattle thin or even die. Third, some farmers rent cattle from others without paying, infringing on the interests of cattle owners. For example, Wang Juru in the village rented Wu Deshan's cattle for plowing, and still owes 130 jin of rice, which made Wu Deshan so angry that he sold the strong cattle and replaced them with young cattle.

    In order to ensure the smooth progress of autumn plowing and sowing, district and township cadres in areas lacking draft animals should quickly organize the masses to study solutions.

### 迅速解决部分农民在秋耕秋种中畜力不足的困难

    迅速解决部分农民在秋耕秋种中畜力不足的困难
    中共四川省崇宁县委员会李明耀、陈楚三来信：崇宁县万寿乡鹅项村今年秋耕秋种中，牛力很缺乏。
    这个村共有水田一千五百多亩，在春耕时共有耕牛三十多只，牛力已感不足，当时借用了邻乡的牛才把秧栽下去了。插秧后村里有些人家把壮牛卖了换成小牛，有的和别村伙喂，结果，牛力大大减弱。为什么会产生这种现象呢？主要原因有三个：一、草料缺，草价贵，牛主负担太重。随着农村经济的好转，农民盖新房、修猪圈的很多，因此草价提高，养牛户不愿养牛。二、伙养的耕牛大家都不爱护。该村伙养耕牛的方法是轮流喂，没有专人负责，这就造成了使“狠心牛”或“忙月都争用，闲月无人管”的现象，把耕牛拖瘦甚至拖死。三、有些农民租用别人的耕牛不给钱，侵犯了牛主利益。如该村王九如租用吴德善的牛代耕，至今还欠一百三十斤米未付，以致吴德善气得把壮牛卖了换成小牛。
    为了使秋耕秋种工作能够顺利进行，缺少耕畜地区的区乡干部应该赶快组织群众研究解决办法。
