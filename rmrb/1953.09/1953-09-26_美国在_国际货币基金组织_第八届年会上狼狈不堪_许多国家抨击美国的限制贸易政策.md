Xinhua News Agency, Washington: At the eighth annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund held in Washington from September 9th to 12th, the strong dissatisfaction of many countries in the capitalist world with the US foreign trade policy put the United States in a very awkward position.

The International Monetary Fund, nominally an international organization, is actually a tool of the United States. Because the status of each country in the International Monetary Fund is determined by the amount of shares each country holds in the fund, the United States alone controls 30.5% of the votes in the organization and has a dominant position. The United States has consistently used this organization to force other countries to abolish import restrictions, lower tariffs, and abolish foreign exchange controls to facilitate the dumping of US goods into other countries. However, the United States itself has built high tariff barriers and adopted various restrictive measures to prevent the import of goods from other countries into the United States.

Many countries have long been very dissatisfied with this hegemonic practice of the United States. This dissatisfaction was fully expressed at this year's annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund. Before the opening of the meeting, many Asian and Latin American countries were brewing a movement to demand that the United States change its trade policy. Representatives of these countries also stated that although the International Monetary Fund, under the manipulation of the United States, has consistently demanded that countries abolish trade restrictions, unless the United States lowers tariffs, they will be forced to continue to implement foreign exchange restrictions. During the course of the meeting, the speeches of many countries' finance ministers, especially those from Asian countries, demanding that the United States revise its policies accounted for a large part of the discussion. These countries demanded that the United States fulfill what it requires other countries to do, demanding that the United States lower tariffs or simplify tariffs, reduce restrictions on imports of various agricultural products, and give merchants from other countries a fair chance to sell goods in the US domestic market. The chairman of the annual meeting, Pakistani Finance Minister Muhammad Ali, also openly called on the United States to implement a policy of "trade, not aid." In his speech, Ali also mentioned Eisenhower's promise to ease trade policies when he ran for president in 1952, to expose the US government's inconsistency between words and deeds. This dissatisfaction was so strong that even the annual report of the International Monetary Fund had to, while defending the United States, suggest that the United States revise its trade policy.

Under these circumstances, on the one hand, the United States insisted on its self-serving trade policy and refused to make any changes, while on the other hand, it did not dare to openly exert pressure, fearing that it would be completely isolated at the meeting. The US delegation decided to adopt a delaying tactic of not responding to the demands of other countries, only letting US Treasury Secretary Humphrey come out and emptily express that "the United States will fully note the impact of US economic policy on the welfare of other countries in the world." However, this tactic of avoiding the edge of the sword by the United States did nothing to reverse the awkward position of the United States throughout the meeting. According to Reuters, "At past annual meetings, the US delegation always played the role of a commanding parent," always ordering other countries that "unless they abide by the rules, the US Congress will not give them this or that aid," but, "At this year's annual meeting, the situation has completely changed." "The US delegation had to quietly listen to" other countries' "lectures" every day. Reuters even said that the United States at this meeting was "forced to adopt a more passive and negative attitude than at any international conference after the war."

    美国在“国际货币基金组织”第八届年会上狼狈不堪
    许多国家抨击美国的限制贸易政策
    【新华社讯】华盛顿消息：在九月九日至十二日于华盛顿举行的国际货币基金组织第八届年会上，资本主义世界许多国家对于美国对外贸易政策的强烈不满，使美国处境十分狼狈。
    名为国际机构的国际货币基金组织，实际上是美国的御用机构。由于各国在国际货币基金组织中的地位是根据各国在基金中的股份多寡来决定的，美国一国就在该组织中控制了百分之三○点五的票数，拥有支配一切的地位。美国一贯利用这个机构来逼迫其他国家取消入口限制、降低关税、废除外汇管制，以便利美国商品对其他国家的倾销。而美国本身却高筑关税壁垒并采取种种限制办法，来阻止其他国家的货物输入美国。
    许多国家对美国这种专横的做法，早就十分不满。这种不满情绪在国际货币基金组织本届年会上充分表现出来。在会议开幕之前，许多亚洲国家和拉丁美洲国家就在酝酿一个运动，要求美国改变贸易政策。这些国家的代表并且表示，尽管国际货币基金组织在美国操纵下，一贯要求各国取消贸易限制，但除非美国降低关税，否则它们就将被迫继续实行外汇限制。在会议进行过程中，许多国家的财政部长，特别是亚洲国家的财政部长要求美国修改政策的发言，占了讨论的很大部分。这些国家要求美国履行它自己要别国做的事情，要求美国降低关税或简化关税，减少各种农产品进口的限制，给他国商人在美国国内市场销售商品的公平机会。年会主席巴基斯坦财政部长穆罕默德·阿里也公开要求美国实行“贸易而非援助”的政策。阿里并在他的演说中提到艾森豪威尔在一九五二年竞选总统时所作放宽贸易政策的诺言，以揭露美国政府的言行不符。这种不满情绪是如此强烈，甚至国际货币基金组织的年度报告书，也不得不在替美国辩解的同时，建议美国把贸易政策加以修改。
    在这种情况之下，美国一方面坚持它的损人利己的贸易政策，拒绝作任何修改，另一方面又不敢公开施加压力，害怕在会上陷于完全孤立。美国代表团决定对其他国家的要求采取一律不予答复的拖延态度，只由美国财政部长汉弗莱出来空空洞洞地表示：“美国将充分注意到美国经济政策对世界其他各国福利的影响”。然而，美国这种回避锋芒的手段，丝毫扭转不了美国在整个会议期间十分狼狈的处境。据路透社说，“在过去历届年会上，充当发号施令的家长要角的总是美国代表团”，它总是命令别的国家“除非守规矩，否则美国国会将不给它们这个或那个援助”，但是，“在这届年会上，情况完全变了。”“美国代表团竟不得不每天静听”别的国家的“训话”。路透社甚至说，美国在这届会议上“被迫采取较之战后任何国际会议都要被动与消极的态度”。
