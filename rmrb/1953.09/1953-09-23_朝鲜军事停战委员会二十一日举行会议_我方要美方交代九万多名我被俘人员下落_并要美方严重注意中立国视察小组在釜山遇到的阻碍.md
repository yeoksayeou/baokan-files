    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 22nd: The Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on September 21st. At the meeting, the Chief Commissioner from the Korean-Chinese side, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, made a specific analysis of the so-called list of over 3,000 captured UN forces personnel that the U.S. side presented at the Military Armistice Commission on September 9th. Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho explained that after preliminary checking of this list by the Korean-Chinese side, it was found that 519 had already been repatriated, and 380 had already been notified to the UN forces in previous lists as having been released on the front lines, or having escaped, or having died. Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho pointed out that this shows that the list submitted by the U.S. side was crudely made and had not been carefully checked at all. As for the remaining part of the list, some were non-direct repatriates, and most had never been captured at all. The Korean-Chinese side reserves the right to continue to comment on this in detail.

    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho also questioned the other side at the meeting about the whereabouts of our captured personnel who have not yet been repatriated. The U.S. Secretary of the Army once publicly stated that 250 captured Chinese People's Volunteers who insisted on repatriation were being held as hostages, but only 138 captured Chinese People's Volunteers were subsequently repatriated. The U.S. side has not yet fully repatriated the list of captured Korean People's Army personnel who insisted on repatriation, which our side has repeatedly submitted, nor has it provided a satisfactory explanation. Regarding the more than 27,000 captured personnel from our side who were forcibly detained by the South Korean Syngman Rhee government and its army, the U.S. commander has repeatedly claimed that he will continue to make efforts to recover them, but has not yet provided any explanation. Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho presented a list of 98,742 captured personnel from our side who have not yet been repatriated or accounted for by the U.S. side, demanding that the U.S. side provide a responsible and specific explanation for each of them. Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho pointed out that, based on the lists of Korean-Chinese captured personnel submitted by the U.S. side during the armistice negotiations, the lists of Korean-Chinese captured personnel compiled by the U.S. side and forwarded by the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as letters from Korean-Chinese captured personnel and publicly published materials by the U.S. side, the Korean-Chinese side has checked the repatriated Korean-Chinese captured personnel and the lists of dead and escaped prisoners of war submitted by the U.S. side. The results of the verification show that at least 83,158 captured Korean People's Army personnel and 15,584 captured Chinese People's Volunteers were held by the U.S. side, but were neither repatriated nor on the lists of deaths and escapes submitted by the U.S. side. The total number of these captured personnel is more than 76,000 more than the total number of Korean-Chinese captured personnel whom the U.S. side claims are not directly repatriated. Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho pointed out that the U.S. side cannot evade the responsibility of providing a responsible explanation for this series of issues.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 21st: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on September 21st, the Chief Commissioner from the Korean-Chinese side, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, demanded that the U.S. side pay serious attention to the difficulties encountered by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Teams stationed in Pusan in supervising and inspecting the replacement of combat materials due to the U.S. side's violation of the armistice agreement, and demanded that the U.S. side immediately take corrective measures and report the correction status to the Military Armistice Commission in order to respond to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

    In a letter to the Military Armistice Commission on September 17th, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission attached a memorandum submitted by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Team stationed in Pusan, reporting the difficulties and obstacles encountered by the team in its work, including the following facts:

    1. U.S. officers in charge of managing combat materials in Pusan refused to grant the Neutral Nations Supervisory Team the right to inspect the replaced combat materials; U.S. officers in charge of managing the docks refused to open a box containing air force materials that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Team requested to inspect, and said that his superiors had instructed him not to open any boxes even if the Neutral Nations Supervisory Team requested it.

    2. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Team was unable to board ships to inspect the combat materials carried by ships entering the port of Pusan.

    3. According to the materials provided by the U.S. side, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Team knew that the ship "Morning Light" was carrying a flamethrower, but when the team requested to inspect the weapon, the U.S. officer in charge replied to the team the next day that the item was neither on the ship nor unloaded, refusing the team to conduct the inspection.

    朝鲜军事停战委员会二十一日举行会议
    我方要美方交代九万多名我被俘人员下落
    并要美方严重注意中立国视察小组在釜山遇到的阻碍
    【新华社开城二十二日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会于九月二十一日举行会议。会上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将对美方于九月九日军事停战委员会上提出的所谓要求朝中方面交代的三千余名联合国军被俘人员的名单，作了具体的分析。李相朝中将说明，朝中方面初步查对这一名单后，发现其中五百十九名已予遣返，三百八十名早已在历次提交联合国军方面的名单中通知过已在前线释放或已逃亡或已死亡。李相朝中将指出，由此可见，美方交来的名单是粗制滥造、根本没有经过详细查对的。至于该名单中的其余部分，一部分是不直接遣返者，而大部分从来就没有被俘过。对此，朝中方面保留继续予以具体评论的权利。
    李相朝中将并在会上追问对方关于仍未遣返的我方被俘人员的下落。美方陆军部长曾公开声明扣留了二百五十名坚持遣返的我方中国人民志愿军被俘人员作为人质，而嗣后仅遣返了一百三十八名中国人民志愿军被俘人员。对于我方历次提出的坚持遣返的我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员的名单，美方至今未予全部遣返，亦未作出满意的交代。对于南朝鲜李承晚政府及其军队破坏协议强迫扣留的二万七千余名我方被俘人员，美方司令官虽一再声称将继续努力予以追回，但至今亦未作任何交代。李相朝中将提出美方至今未予遣返亦未作任何交代的九万八千七百四十二名我方被俘人员的名单，要求美方对其中每一个人作出负责与具体的交代。李相朝中将指出，朝中方面根据停战谈判中美方历次交来的朝中被俘人员的名单、红十字国际委员会转来的美方编制的朝中被俘人员名单以及朝中被俘人员来信和美方公开发表的材料，核对了已遣返的朝中被俘人员和美方交来的死亡和逃亡的战俘名单，核对的结果显示，至少仍有朝鲜人民军被俘人员八万三千一百五十八人和中国人民志愿军被俘人员一万五千五百八十四人，曾为美方所收容，但既未被遣返亦不在美方交来的死亡与逃亡的名单之中，这些被俘人员的总数比美方声称的不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员总数多七万六千余人。李相朝中将指出，美方对于这一系列的问题决不能逃避作出负责交代的责任。
    【新华社开城二十一日电】军事停战委员会二十一日会议上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将要求美方严重注意由于美方违反停战协定，使驻釜山的中立国视察小组监督与视察作战物资的替换的工作遭遇困难的事件，并要求美方立即采取纠正措施及将纠正情况报告军事停战委员会，以便答复中立国监察委员会。
    中立国监察委员会在九月十七日写给军事停战委员会的信中，附有驻釜山的中立国视察小组提出的备忘录，报告小组在工作中所遇到的困难和阻碍，其中包括下列事实：
    一、美方在釜山负责管理作战物资的军官拒绝给予中立国视察小组视察替换的作战物资的权利；美方负责管理码头的军官拒绝打开中立国视察小组要求检查的一个装有空军物资的箱子，并说他的上级曾指示他，即使中立国视察小组提出要求也不要打开任何箱子。
    二、中立国视察小组不能上船检查驶进釜山港的轮船所载运的作战物资。
    三、中立国视察小组根据美方提出的材料，知道晨光号轮船载有一具火焰喷射器，但当小组要求视察该项武器时，美方的负责军官在第二天回答小组说该项物资既不在船上也没有卸下，拒绝小组进行视察。
