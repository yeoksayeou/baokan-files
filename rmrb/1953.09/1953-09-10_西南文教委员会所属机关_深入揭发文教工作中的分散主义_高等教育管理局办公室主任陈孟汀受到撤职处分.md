The organizations affiliated with the Southwest Cultural and Educational Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Cultural and Educational Committee organs) focused all their efforts on opposing decentralism in June during the in-depth anti-bureaucracy struggle, and achieved good results.

The decentralism of the Southwest Cultural and Educational Committee organs is prominently manifested in the fact that a few leading Party cadres broke away from the leadership of the Party, violated the decisions and instructions of the Party, and attempted to turn their small units into independent kingdoms. For example, Comrade Chen Mengting (already demoted), Director of the Office of the Southwest Higher Education Bureau and former Deputy Director of the Higher Education Section of the Southwest Cultural and Educational Department, after learning that the higher leading body had decided on the candidate for Director of the Southwest Higher Education Bureau, violated the organizational principles of the Party and, at a Party meeting, groundlessly said that Han Ming (formerly Secretary of the Jiangjin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Sichuan Province) was not suitable and requested discussion of this issue (which was stopped). He also privately wrote a letter to the Higher Education Department of the Central Government, opposing this decision.

The transfer of Comrade Han Ming to the position of Director of the Southwest Higher Education Bureau was decided by the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and submitted by the Chairman of the Southwest Administrative Committee to the State Council for approval. The Party Constitution stipulates that "an individual Party member obeys the Party organization to which he belongs, the minority obeys the majority, the lower-level organizations obey the higher-level organizations, and the partial organizations uniformly obey the Central Committee" and "strictly abide by Party discipline and unconditionally implement resolutions," but Chen Mengting, for personal purposes, carried out personal activities, violated the Party Constitution, and undermined the Party's decision. After the current director took office, he excluded him, not showing important official documents and letters to the director; he also told the cadres below: "Han Ming is new and doesn't understand the situation, and doesn't solve problems," in order to undermine the director's prestige. When he went to Chengdu, he gave the authority to sign official documents within the bureau to a section chief. He also privately convened a meeting on the adjustment of departments and faculties, only notifying the director to attend the meeting the night before it was held. Chen Mengting's purpose in doing this was to try to turn the Southwest Higher Education Bureau into his personal independent kingdom. During the restructuring of institutions in January of this year, he privately designated and announced a list of several section chiefs or office heads within the bureau, thus forming his own small circle by means of private co-option.

The development of Chen Mengting's errors to such a serious extent was not accidental. In his work, he consistently failed to ask for instructions or report to his superiors, and made decisions and handled major issues related to universities and colleges without authorization. He introduced his staff member as a section chief, making false reports to deceive. When he went out to work, he made reports everywhere indiscriminately, arbitrarily reprimanding school administrators and teachers. At the same time, he violated policies, disrupted financial and economic systems, and casually promised the schools to buy cars and allocate tens of billions of yuan for construction, causing great damage to the prestige of the Party and the government and to cultural and educational work.

Comrade Chen Mengting's decentralist errors, which deviated from the Party's leadership, had developed to such a serious extent that he ideologically departed from Marxism-Leninism and developed bourgeois individualism; organizationally, he became independent from the Party, engaged in small circles, and attempted to turn the Higher Education Bureau into his own independent kingdom; and stylistically, he departed from the Party's style and revived certain styles of the Kuomintang. Due to the consistency of his errors and their serious danger to the prestige of the Party and the government, as well as to cultural and educational work, the Southwest Cultural and Educational Committee, with the approval of the Chairman of the Southwest Administrative Committee, imposed an administrative penalty of demotion. The Party's disciplinary action will be decided through internal Party discussion.

Comrade Chen Mengting's mistakes are inseparable from the mistakes of Comrade Xu Fangting, the former Deputy Minister of the Southwest Cultural and Educational Department and the current Director of the Southwest Education Bureau. Comrade Xu Fangting took a long-term attitude of tolerance and even protection towards Chen Mengting's mistakes. He did not take a firm stand from the Party's perspective to seriously struggle against Chen Mengting's erroneous behavior of engaging in personal activities and excluding the current director, nor did he report it to his superiors, but only told everyone "not to brew." He himself also had the erroneous behavior of attacking the current Director of the Southwest Higher Education Bureau. Xu Fangting's decentralism, which deviated from the Party's leadership, rejected the Party's instructions, and made independence demands of the Party, was particularly prominent before and after the anti-bureaucracy struggle. In his report at the cadre meeting of the Cultural and Educational Committee organs to mobilize the anti-bureaucracy struggle, Comrade Zhang Ziyi, Director of the Southwest Cultural and Educational Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out that in addition to carrying out the anti-bureaucracy struggle in accordance with the instructions of the higher authorities, the Cultural and Educational Committee organs should also solve the problems of some cadres being disunited with newly dispatched cadres and the tendencies of some cadres towards pride, complacency, lack of organization, and lack of discipline. However, Xu Fangting, as one of the Party group members and actually responsible for leading the anti-bureaucracy struggle in the Cultural and Educational Committee organs, ignored the instructions of the Southwest Bureau and continued to resist, expressing resentment and confrontation. For example, he said, "Minister Zhang doesn't understand the situation," and "What's so great about it? He only has a guiding relationship with me;" he spread the atmosphere in the organs that "Minister Zhang's speech is incorrect." Later, when the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on the plan for the anti-bureaucracy struggle of the Party organization of the Cultural and Educational Committee organs, it once again raised the above-mentioned issues and demanded that they be resolved, but Xu Fangting still refused to implement them. This is the most blatant manifestation of rejecting the Party's leadership and instructions. When Comrade Liao Jingdan, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Southwest Bureau, raised the issue of decentralism during the inspection, Xu Fangting repeatedly resisted and denied that decentralism existed in the Cultural and Educational Committee organs. This shows that Xu Fangting's decentralism of making independence demands of the Party has developed to a very serious extent.

The ideological source of Comrade Xu Fangting's decentralism is based on bourgeois individualism, dissatisfaction with the Party, and therefore rejection of the Party's leadership and instructions, and making independence demands of the Party. He and Chen Mengting and others, under the same ideological source, combined to form sectarian tendencies, excluding cadres who were decided by the Party and sent to work in the cultural and educational organs, and attempting to turn the cultural and educational organs into an independent kingdom. When Comrade Xu Fangting first arrived at the Cultural and Educational Department, he worked cautiously and actively. After he achieved some success in his work, he began to become proud and complacent, satisfied with some achievements in routine administrative affairs, not very interested in politics, and not working hard in learning. Therefore, he began to lag behind politically, and his thoughts began to deviate from Marxism-Leninism, breeding bourgeois individualist thoughts.

Under the influence of the decentralism of comrades Xu Fangting, Chen Mengting, and others, bourgeois liberalism and a lack of Party principles grew in the Cultural and Educational Committee organs, so that many young cadres could not learn the correct style of the Party, resulting in ideological confusion, unclear right and wrong, and serious tendencies such as lack of organization and discipline. For example, some cadres of the Southwest Higher Education Bureau were arrogant, considering themselves "superior" and looking down on everyone. Even a staff member dared to sign important official documents. Bourgeois thoughts grew within the Party organization of the Cultural and Educational Committee organs. There was no democratic life, and there was an extreme lack of criticism and self-criticism. This greatly weakened the Party's leading role in the cultural and educational organs. The phenomenon of each doing his own thing and no one being responsible in the work was also quite serious. What was even more serious in the work was that they did not conscientiously implement the instructions of the higher authorities or even violated the instructions of the higher authorities and engaged in their own things. For example, regarding the work of setting up majors in universities and colleges, the Central Ministry of Education had instructions, stating that due to the lack of teachers and equipment in higher education, it was currently impossible to set up many majors; referring to the professional settings of the Soviet Union, the professional settings of engineering in national universities and colleges in 1952 were proposed based on the needs of the country for cadres in the short term and the current possible conditions of higher industrial schools. However, the leadership of the original Southwest Cultural and Educational Department did not seriously study these instructions, nor did they consider the region's teachers, equipment, and the actual situation of each school at that time. They asked the schools of engineering to quickly decide on the professional settings, formulate teaching plans for the fourth year of undergraduate programs and the second year of specialized programs, and stipulated that they should all be implemented starting from the autumn of this year; they also required that departments and faculties such as literature, science, politics, law, finance and economics, and teacher training be able to start adopting the professional system in this year's freshmen. In terms of time, the schools were required to report the professional settings of specialized programs to the department within seventeen days, and the professional settings of undergraduate programs within one month. A total of one hundred and two majors were set up in universities and colleges in the entire region this time. According to the results of the inspection conducted by the Central Higher Education Department in March of this year: among the fifty-one engineering majors alone, there were as many as nine that should be discontinued or adjusted due to poor conditions, another five that needed to be changed in nature, and sixteen that needed to be greatly supplemented with conditions to continue operating. This excessively rapid and high demand for teaching work is one of the important reasons for the current phenomenon of excessive teaching tasks in schools, excessive tension and busyness of teachers and students, poor health conditions, and poor digestion of learning by students. Regarding the mistakes of comrades Xu Fangting and others, the Party adhered to the policy of education and repeatedly helped Xu Fangting and others to recognize their mistakes and patiently waited for their awakening. However, Xu Fangting and others continued to passively resist. Later, although comrades Xu Fangting and others also made preliminary self-criticisms, they were extremely superficial. In order to educate all cadres and Comrade Xu Fangting himself, the Southwest Cultural and Educational Committee requested the Chairman of the Southwest Administrative Committee to approve an administrative demerit penalty for Comrade Xu Fangting (because it was the first time he had committed such a serious error), and ordered Comrade Xu Fangting to make a written self-criticism. The Party's disciplinary action will be decided after the Party organization examines his written self-criticism.

At the plenary staff meeting held on June 25, Comrade Zhang Ziyi made a summary report. He first made a comprehensive analysis and criticism of the nature and harm of the errors of Chen Mengting and others.

The Southwest Cultural and Educational Committee organs then continued to deeply examine and criticize the subjective and bureaucratic work styles that were divorced from reality in their work, deepen cadres' understanding of policies and guidelines, improve cadres' ideological level, and strengthen cadres' confidence in doing their work well. On this basis, everyone put forward many suggestions and methods for improving their work. Now, all organs and units have formulated work plans and systems for requesting instructions, reporting, and learning. In terms of cadres' political and theoretical learning, emphasis is placed on strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism and improving the political and ideological level of cadres. The Southwest Higher Education Bureau recently convened a meeting on the adjustment of secondary technical schools and adopted the Southwest Region's plan for the adjustment of secondary technical schools. The adjustment work of secondary technical schools has now begun. In terms of cultural center work, the Southwest Culture Bureau has sent a working group to Kunming to deeply examine and solve the existing problems in cultural center work. The Southwest Health Bureau, the Southwest News and Publication Bureau, and other organs and units affiliated with the Cultural and Educational Committee are actively adjusting their establishments and improving their work, and are implementing the spirit of the anti-bureaucracy and anti-decentralism struggle into their actual work.

    西南文教委员会所属机关
    深入揭发文教工作中的分散主义
    高等教育管理局办公室主任陈孟汀受到撤职处分
    西南文化教育委员会所属机关（以下简称文委机关）在深入开展反官僚主义斗争中，于六月间集中全力反对了分散主义，并收到了良好效果。
    西南文委机关的分散主义，突出地表现在少数党员负责干部脱离党的领导，违背党的决定、指示，企图把自己的小单位变成独立王国。如西南高等教育管理局办公室主任、原西南文教部高等教育处副处长陈孟汀同志（已撤职），在他知道上级领导机关决定西南高等教育管理局局长的人选后，竟破坏党的组织原则，在党的会议上，毫无根据地说韩明
    （原任中共四川省江津地委书记）不行，并要求讨论这个问题（被制止）。他又私自写信给中央高等教育部，反对这一决定。
    韩明同志的调任西南高等教育管理局局长，是中共中央西南局决定，由西南行政委员会主席提请政务院批准的。党章规定：“党员个人服从所属党的组织，少数服从多数，下级组织服从上级组织，部分组织统一服从中央”、“严格地遵守党纪和无条件地执行决议”，但陈孟汀为了个人目的，进行个人活动，违反党章，破坏党的决定。在现任局长到职后，他又加以排斥，不把重要公文函电给局长看；又对下面的干部说：“韩明新来，不了解情况，不解决问题”，以打击局长的威信。他去成都时，把局内的公文签署权交给一科长。他还私自召开院系调整会议，到开会前一天晚上才通知局长出席会议。陈孟汀这样作的目的，在于企图把西南高等教育管理局变成他个人的独立王国。今年一月间调整机构时，他私自在局内指定并宣布了几个科长或办公室负责人名单，这样就用私人拉拢手段形成了自己的小圈子。
    陈孟汀的错误发展到如此严重的程度，并不是偶然的。他在工作中对上级一贯不请示不报告，擅自决定和处理有关大、专学校的重大问题。他介绍自己的科员是科长，作假报告实行欺骗。他出去工作时，到处乱作报告，任意训斥学校行政负责人和教师。同时违反政策，破坏财经制度，随便答应学校方面买汽车，拨数十亿元的修建费等，使党和政府的威信及文教工作受到很大的损失。
    陈孟汀同志脱离党的领导的分散主义错误已发展到如此严重程度，以致在思想上离开马克思列宁主义，发展资产阶级个人主义；在组织上向党闹独立，搞小圈子，企图把高等教育管理局变成自己的独立王国；在作风上离开党的作风，复活着某些国民党的作风。由于他的错误带有一贯性及其对党和政府的威信以及对文教工作的严重危险性，经西南文委提请西南行政委员会主席批准，在行政上予以撤职处分。党内处分由党内讨论决定。
    陈孟汀同志的错误，是和原西南文教部副部长、现任西南教育局局长徐方庭同志的错误分不开的。徐方庭同志对陈孟汀的错误长期采取容忍以至包庇的态度。他对陈孟汀进行私人活动，排斥现任局长的错误行为，不是站在党的立场进行严肃的斗争，也不向上级报告，只是叫大家“不要酝酿”。他自己也有打击西南高等教育管理局现任局长的错误行为。徐方庭同志脱离党的领导，拒绝党的指示，向党闹独立性的分散主义，在反官僚主义斗争前后表现得异常突出。西南文委主任、中共中央西南局宣传部部长张子意同志在文委机关的干部大会上动员开展反官僚主义斗争的报告中，指出文委机关除按照上级指示进行反官僚主义斗争外，还应解决某些干部对新派来的干部闹不团结以及某些干部的骄傲自满、无组织无纪律的倾向等问题。但徐方庭同志身为党组干事之一，又实际负责领导文委机关反官僚主义斗争，竟对西南局的指示，置之不理，继续进行抗拒，发牢骚表示对抗。如说“张部长不了解情况”，又说“有什么了不起，他和我仅只指导关系”；在机关中散布“张部长讲话不正确”的空气。以后中共中央西南局在批示文委机关党组织反官僚主义斗争计划时，再次提出上述问题，要求加以解决，但徐方庭同志仍拒不执行。这是拒绝党的领导和指示的最露骨的表现。当西南局宣传部副部长廖井丹同志在检查中提出分散主义问题时，徐方庭又一再表示抗拒，否认文委机关中存在着分散主义。这说明徐方庭向党闹独立性的分散主义，已发展到十分严重的程度。
    徐方庭同志的分散主义的思想根源，是从资产阶级个人主义出发，对党不满，因此拒绝党的领导和指示，向党闹独立性。他和陈孟汀等在同一思想根源下，结合起来，形成宗派主义倾向，排斥由党决定而派去文教机关工作的干部，企图使文教机关变成独立王国。徐方庭同志初到文教部时，还谨慎地积极地工作。在工作中有了一些成绩后，他就开始骄傲自满起来，满足于日常行政事务工作中的一些成绩，对政治不很感兴趣，对学习不努力，因此政治上开始落后，思想上开始离开马克思列宁主义，滋长着资产阶级个人主义思想。
    在徐方庭、陈孟汀等同志的分散主义影响下，在文委机关中滋长着资产阶级自由主义，缺少党的原则的空气，使许多青年干部，学不到党的正确的作风，产生思想混乱，是非不明，以及严重的无组织无纪律等倾向。如西南高等教育管理局的某些干部趾高气扬，自以为“高人一等”，目空一切，一个科员也敢于签署重要公文；在文委机关的党组织内滋长着资产阶级思想，没有民主生活，极端缺乏批评与自我批评。这样就大大削弱了党在文教机关中的领导作用。工作中各自为政、无人负责的现象，也是相当严重的。在工作中表现更严重的是不认真执行上级的指示甚至违背上级指示，自搞一套。例如关于高等学校的专业设置工作，中央教育部曾有指示，说明由于高等教育师资、设备的缺乏，目前还不可能设置很多专业；参照苏联的专业设置，先就短期内国家需要干部的情况及高等工业学校目前的可能条件，提出一九五二年全国高等学校工科的专业设置。但原西南文教部领导方面并没有认真研究这个指示，也不考虑本区的师资设备以及各校当时的实际情况，要求各校工科从速决定专业设置，制订本科四年级和专科二年级的教学计划，并规定一律从本年度秋季开始执行；还要求文、理、政法、财经、师范等系科，能在本年新生中开始采行专业制度。在时间上，要求各校把专科的专业设置情况在十七天内报部，本科的专业设置在一月内报部。全区高等学校此次一共设置了一百零二个专业。据今年三月中央高等教育部派人检查的结果：仅工科的五十一个专业中，因条件太差应该停设或调整的就有九个之多，另有五个是需要改变性质的，有十六个是需要大力补充条件才能继续办下去的。这种对教学工作过急过高的要求，是造成当前学校中教学任务过重、师生过分紧张忙迫、健康情况不佳、学生学习消化不良等现象的重要原因之一。对徐方庭等同志的错误，党坚持了教育的方针，曾反复帮助徐方庭等认识自己的错误，耐心等待他们的觉悟。但徐方庭等仍继续消极对抗。后来徐方庭等同志虽然也作了初步检讨，但极不深刻。为了教育全体干部和徐方庭同志本人，西南文委提请西南行政委员会主席批准，在行政上给徐方庭同志以记过处分
    （因为他犯这种严重错误还是第一次），并责令徐方庭同志作书面检讨。党内处分由党组织审查他的书面检讨后决定。
    在六月二十五日召开的全体工作人员大会上张子意同志作了总结报告，他首先就陈孟汀等人的错误性质及其危害性作了全面的分析和批判。
    西南文委机关紧接着又继续深入检查、批判了工作中脱离实际的主观主义和官僚主义的工作作风，加深干部对政策方针的认识，提高干部的思想水平，加强做好工作的信心。在这个基础上，大家提出了许多改进工作的意见和办法。现在各机关单位都制订了工作计划和请示、报告以及学习等制度。在干部政治理论学习方面，强调加强马克思列宁主义的学习，提高干部的政治思想水平。西南高等教育管理局最近召开了中等技术学校调整会议，通过了西南区中等技术学校调整方案。中等技术学校的调整工作现已开始。在文化馆工作方面，西南文化局已派工作组去昆明，深入检查并解决文化馆工作中存在的问题。文委所属的西南卫生局、西南新闻出版局等机关单位，都在积极地调整编制，改进工作，把反官僚主义、反分散主义斗争的精神贯彻到实际工作中去。    （甘泉）
