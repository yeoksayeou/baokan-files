Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: An additional four non-directly repatriated Korean People's Army prisoners of war broke through the control of the Syngman Rhee special agents on the 16th and expressed their desire to be repatriated. Up to now, a total of fourteen Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have risked their lives to win freedom before the explanation work even began.

These four people who demanded repatriation today have been separated from the rest of the prisoners of war, awaiting the decision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

As the last batch of five hundred Korean People's Army prisoners of war were about to enter the fenced-in camp this afternoon, one Korean People's Army prisoner of war rushed out and told the Indian guard beside him that he was determined to go home. Syngman Rhee's special agents jumped out and violently beat him, trying to drag him back. The Indian guard rushed forward to save him and sent him to the camp hospital for treatment.

Earlier this afternoon, one Korean People's Army prisoner of war from another batch of prisoners of war also broke through the control of the special agents and demanded repatriation.

Two other Korean People's Army prisoners of war took advantage of the opportunity to get off the truck outside the prisoner-of-war camp this morning to first escape the control of the Syngman Rhee special agents. They left the other prisoners of war and ran into the bushes to hide. They immediately told the Indian troops that they wanted to be repatriated.

The injury of a Korean People's Army prisoner of war this afternoon shows that the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents are using terror tactics to prevent prisoners of war from expressing their will to be repatriated. This is precisely why the American military authorities are afraid of the presence of representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Observer representatives and reporters were again forced to move further back, yesterday being twenty meters away, now being seventy meters away, so that they can only glimpse the passing prisoners of war from afar through the ten-meter gap between the large tarpaulins covering the barbed wire.

Today, 1,994 Korean People's Army prisoners of war were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody. Since the transfer began six days ago, the US side has handed over a total of 3,982 Korean People's Army prisoners of war and 5,636 Chinese People's Volunteers prisoners of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th: This morning, another Korean People's Army prisoner of war broke through special agent control and demanded repatriation upon arrival at the Neutral Nations custody camp. This Korean People's Army prisoner of war has been isolated and guarded by Indian troops. Up to now, seventeen Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have risked their lives to win freedom before the explanation work even began.

### 我方被俘人员五名突破特务控制要求遣返

    我方被俘人员五名突破特务控制要求遣返
    【新华社开城十六日电】另外有四名不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员十六日突破李承晚特务的控制，表示希望被遣返。直到目前为止，一共已有十四名朝中被俘人员在解释工作开始以前冒着生命危险争取到了自由。
    今天要求遣返的这四个人，已经和其余的战俘分隔开来，等待中立国遣返委员会的决定。
    当今天下午最后一批五百名朝鲜人民军战俘正要走进围有铁丝网的营场时，一个朝鲜人民军战俘冲出来，告诉在旁边的印度卫兵说，他决心要回家。李承晚的特务跳出来凶暴地打他，想把他拖回去。印度卫兵赶上前去救了他，把他送到营场医院去治疗。
    今天下午早一些时候，另一批战俘中的一名朝鲜人民军战俘也突破特务的控制，要求遣返。
    另外两名朝鲜人民军战俘今天上午乘在俘虏营外面下卡车的机会，首先摆脱李承晚特务的控制。他们离开其他的战俘，跑到矮树丛里去隐蔽。他们随即对印度军队说，他们希望被遣返。
    今天下午一名朝鲜人民军战俘的受伤，表明李承晚和蒋介石特务采取恐怖手段阻止战俘表示他们希望遣返的意志。正因为这样，美国军事当局才害怕朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表到场。观察代表和记者又被迫更向后移动，昨天相距二十公尺，现在相距七十公尺，因而他们只能通过盖在铁丝网上的大帆布之间的十公尺的空隙，远远瞥见走过的战俘。
    今天有一千九百九十四名朝鲜人民军战俘交给中立国遣返委员会看管，从六天前移交开始时，到现在为止，美方共交出三千九百八十二名朝鲜人民军被俘人员和五千六百三十六名中国人民志愿军被俘人员。
    【新华社开城十八日电】今天上午，又有一个朝鲜人民军被俘人员在到达中立国看管营场时突破特务控制要求遣返回国。这个朝鲜人民军被俘人员已由印度军队隔离看管。到现在为止，已有十七个朝中被俘人员在解释工作开始以前冒着生命危险争取到了自由。
