Letter from National Model Agricultural Laborer Han Enlai: Increasing production and practicing economy are long-term tasks for the people of the whole country. It is greatly beneficial to both the country and ourselves for us farmers to actively increase production and practice economy. When we sell the increased grain and industrial raw materials to the state, our income increases; when the state has sufficient grain and industrial raw materials, it can better develop industry; when the state is industrialized, it can supply farmers with a large number of agricultural machines, chemical fertilizers, and daily-use industrial products, helping farmers improve production and improve their lives. Last year, I visited the Soviet Union and witnessed the highly developed state of agricultural production and the happy life of the farmers there. We Chinese farmers must follow the path of Soviet farmers, and we should now actively increase production and practice economy to support the country's industrial construction.

This year, our cooperative has thoroughly implemented the business policy of focusing on agricultural production, adhered to fixed division of labor and quota management, improved the enthusiasm of the members, and improved farming techniques. Of the cooperative's ninety hectares of crops, except for five hectares of corn seeds that are of poor quality, the rest are growing luxuriantly and pleasingly. The twenty hectares of double-seedling soybeans planted with seeders are growing with thick stalks, many branches, and dense pods. Each bean plant generally bears seventy or eighty pods, twenty or thirty more than in previous years. It is estimated that the yield per hectare can reach four to five thousand catties. The twenty hectares of rice, the rice grains are growing plump, it is estimated that each hectare can yield more than ten thousand catties... However, we will never be complacent because of this, but will earnestly do a good job in the autumn harvest, ensuring that every grain returns home and guaranteeing an increase in grain production this year. Now, each production team has assigned special personnel to repair farm tools, carts, and ropes, leveled four threshing grounds, and prepared for harvesting. The cooperative management committee pays attention to grasping the agricultural season, strengthens planning, and ensures that one piece is harvested as soon as it is ripe, and promptly pulled to the threshing ground, so as to avoid losses from the crops being overripe and grain shattering and from wind and birds eating them. Improve the quality of land cutting, land pulling, and threshing operations: when cutting soybeans, do not leave "horse ears"; when cutting millet, hands should be light and knives should be fast, and pay attention to not dropping grains. When pulling the land, the cart box should be padded tightly, leaving no gaps, so as not to leak grains; in order to prevent the grains falling on the cart from being wasted, the cart box is swept every time it is unloaded. The threshing ground is first pressed with stone rollers, and then beaten with curtain catties, the soybeans are beaten twice, and the millet is turned twice; in order to avoid beating "package pot fields" (because the threshing ground is not dry and the grain is pressed on the ground), the threshing ground has now been repeatedly pressed three or four times, and a layer of yellow soil has been laid on top, making it "deng deng hard". We also pay attention to livestock management: now the livestock pens have been tidied up, and they are all very strong; during the autumn harvest, the livestock are not allowed to be outside, so as to avoid them eating crops and harming the threshing ground; livestock should be muzzled when pulling the land and threshing. In addition, we must combine the autumn harvest with the work of selecting seeds and autumn plowing, laying the foundation for increasing production next year. According to the needs of the whole cooperative, the five hectares of seed collection fields (two hectares of rice, two hectares of soybeans, and one hectare of corn) should be cut, stacked, threshed, and stored separately; this year, fifteen hectares of land should be plowed in autumn, and plowing and harrowing should be combined.

In addition, we have also researched the following methods in terms of increasing production and practicing economy:

(1) Hand in public grain well and actively sell surplus grain to the state to support national industrial construction. We have decided to select good grain for public grain after threshing, screen out broken, half, and shriveled grains from soybeans, fan the rice with a winnowing machine, and remove the tips and tails from the corn; and organize carts to deliver them all within three days. In addition to the grain needed by the members themselves, all the surplus grain will be sold to the cooperative and sold to the state.

(2) According to the labor and animal power of the whole cooperative, engage in sideline production in a planned way after the autumn harvest to increase income. After the autumn harvest, forty strong laborers and ten cattle plows will be drawn from the cooperative to participate in winter logging in the mountains; twenty half-laborers and women will be drawn to cut woolly grass at home, and after the snow falls and freezes, they will switch to weaving production, making grass ropes and weaving grass bags for local basic construction. In addition, we must also help members do a good job in household sideline production. Currently, the members of the whole cooperative have sixty piglets and thirty medium-sized pigs weighing one hundred seventy or eighty catties. They must be fed diligently (bran and vegetables) and the pens must be padded frequently to prevent the pigs from getting sick and growing fat.

(3) Reduce unnecessary consumption and concentrate resources on investing in expanding reproduction. For example, the original decision to put tiles on the twenty-one brick houses was later changed to putting thatch on them; during the hoeing period, members were organized to cut more than 50,000 bundles of foreign grass in the Dianzi instead of tiles, saving more than 21 million yuan. During the spring plowing, we considered that everyone would concentrate on building houses during the hoeing period, and there would be no time to graze livestock and cut green grass, so we opened up four hectares of wasteland on the Nanshan Gang to plant barnyard grass, preparing to cut green grass to feed the livestock during the hoeing period; now these four hectares of land can yield sixty dan of barnyard grass as grain, and the barnyard grass can still be used to feed livestock. With these savings methods, we estimate that we can buy another new-style plow and a batch of chemical fertilizers next year. In addition, the members have also paid attention to careful calculation in making clothes and eating and drinking to avoid waste.

In order to ensure that the above things are done well, the cooperative cadres, party members, league members, and production activists not only take the lead in increasing production and practicing economy, but also pay attention to cultivating typical examples and promoting the work of the general public, and use concrete examples to educate members. We must turn increasing production and practicing economy into the actual actions of all members, and win a great victory on the front of increasing production and practicing economy. At the same time, we hope that agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and the vast number of farmer brothers in various places will actively work hard to increase production and practice economy.

    全国农业劳动模范韩恩来信
    保证粮食丰收，努力增产节约
    全国农业劳动模范韩恩来信：增加生产、厉行节约，是全国人民长期的任务。我们农民积极增产节约，对国家、对自己都有很大好处。我们把增产出来的粮食和工业原料卖给国家，自己就增加了收入；国家有了充分的粮食和工业原料，就能更好地发展工业；国家工业化了，就能供给农民大量的农业机器、化学肥料和日用工业品，帮助农民提高生产和改善生活。去年我到苏联参观，亲眼看到苏联农业生产高度发展的情况和农民的幸福生活。我们中国农民要走苏联农民的路，现在就应该积极增产节约，支援国家的工业建设。
    今年我们合作社由于贯彻了以农业生产为主的经营方针，坚持了固定分工和定额管理，提高了社员劳动热情，改进了耕作技术，全社九十垧庄稼，除了五垧苞米籽粒较差外，其余都长得丰盛喜人。用播种机种的二十垧双苗眼大豆长得秸粗、杈多、荚密，每棵豆子一般结荚七、八十个，较往年多结二、三十个，估计每垧产量可达四、五千斤。二十垧水稻，稻籽都长得鼓鼓的，估计每垧能打一万多斤……。可是我们决不因此自满，还要认真做好秋收，做到颗粒还家，保证今年粮食增产。现在各生产队已抽出专人修理好农具和大车、绳套，平完四个场院，做好了收割的准备工作。合作社管理委员会注意掌握农时，加强计划性，做到熟一片割一片、并及时拉到场院，以免庄稼过熟崩粒和风磨鸟食的损失。提高割地、拉地、打场的作业质量：割豆子不留马耳朵；割谷子手要轻、刀要快，注意不掉粒。拉地时要把车箱垫严，不留缝子，以免漏粒；为了使掉在车上的谷粒不糟蹋，每卸一次车就扫一次车箱。打场先用石滚子压，后用帘斤打，豆子打二遍，谷子翻二场；为了不打“包锅场”（因场院不干而把粮食压在地皮上），现在场院已反复压了三、四回，上面铺了一层黄土，弄得“登登硬”。我们并注意牲畜管理：现在牲畜圈已经整理好了，都挺结实；秋收时牲畜一律不放在外面，以避免它们吃庄稼和祸害场院；在拉地、打场时牲畜要兜嘴。另外，我们还要结合秋收做好选种和秋翻地工作，给明年增产打下基础。根据全社需要，五垧采种田（水稻二垧、豆子二垧、苞米一垧）要单割、单垛、单打、单藏；今年要秋翻十五垧地，并做到翻耙结合。
    此外，我们在增产节约方面还研究出下面几个办法：
    （一）缴好公粮并积极向国家出售余粮，支援国家工业建设。我们决定打完场后就挑好粮做公粮，大豆要筛出破、半、瘪粒，稻谷用风车扇一遍，苞米去尖去尾；并组织好大车在三天内送完。除了社员们自己需要的粮食以外，把余粮全部送到合作社卖给国家。
    （二）根据全社人力、畜力情况，在秋后有计划地搞副业生产，增加收入。秋后在社内抽出较硬实的劳力四十个和牛爬犁十张，入山参加冬季采伐工作；抽出二十个半劳力和妇女在家割乌拉草，落雪封冻后转入编织生产，打草绳子、织草袋子供当地的基本建设用。此外，还要帮助社员搞好家庭副业，目前全社社员家所养的有六十头小猪、三十头一百七、八十斤的中猪，都要勤喂食（糠菜）、勤垫圈，使猪不生病，长的胖。
    （三）减少不必要的消费，集中力量投资扩大再生产。如原决定上瓦盖的二十一间砖房，后来决定改上草盖；在挂锄期间组织社员到甸子里割出五万多捆洋草代替了瓦，节省了二千一百多万元。春耕时，我们考虑到挂锄期间大家集中力量整房子，没空放牲畜、割青草，所以在南山岗上开了四垧荒地种上稗子，准备在挂锄期间割青喂牲口；现在这四垧地可以打六十石稗子当粮食，稗草仍可以喂牲口。我们用这些节约办法，估计明年可以再买一台新式犁和一批化学肥料。此外，社员们在做衣服和吃喝上也注意了精打细算，避免浪费。
    为了保证做好上面这些事情，合作社干部、党员、团员、生产积极分子不但积极在增产节约工作中带头，并且注意了培养典型、推动一般的工作方法，用具体范例来教育社员。我们一定要把增产节约变成全体社员的实际行动，并在增产节约战线上打个大胜仗。同时，希望各地农业生产合作社、互助组以及广大农民兄弟都积极为增产节约而努力。
