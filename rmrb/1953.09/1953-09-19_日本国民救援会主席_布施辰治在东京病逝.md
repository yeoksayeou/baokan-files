    Japanese National Relief Association Chairman
    Tatsuji Fuse Dies in Tokyo
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] Tatsuji Fuse, chairman of the Japanese National Relief Association and advisor to the Free Lawyers Group (i.e., the Free Lawyers Association), passed away in Tokyo on the 13th due to illness, at the age of 72.
    Tatsuji Fuse was a prominent Japanese legal professional who actively fought for Japan's democratic cause for 50 years. In many incidents where Japanese militarists suppressed the Japanese people before the war, and in cases such as the "Mitaka Incident" and the "Matsukawa Incident" fabricated by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries after the war to persecute the Japanese people, Tatsuji Fuse spoke out righteously, exposing the ruling clique's evil conspiracies and defending the persecuted Japanese people. Tatsuji Fuse was also actively involved in the Japanese people's relief efforts.
