    The Unprecedented Isolation of the United States in the United Nations
    Pei Wen
    From August 17 to August 28, the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly held its final meeting to discuss the composition of the political conference. The result of the twelve-day meeting once again proved to the world that the United States, which has tried every possible means to maintain international tension, is in an unprecedentedly isolated position in the United Nations, due to the increasing number of countries that support a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.
    Regarding the composition of the political conference, there are two main proposals. The Soviet Union, China, and North Korea firmly advocated that the political conference should take the form of a round-table conference with joint consultation among the countries concerned. According to this proposal, in addition to the countries on both sides of the armistice, other countries concerned with the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue should also participate. Only in this way can it be ensured that the political conference is conducted in an atmosphere of peaceful consultation, and that the political conference makes a more effective contribution to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This is fully in line with the principle of resolving international disputes on the basis of equal consultation, and it is extremely beneficial to consolidating peace in the Far East and the world. However, the so-called "fifteen-nation proposal" concocted by the United States opposed the round-table conference format for the political conference, and unreasonably limited the countries participating in the conference to the "two sides" of the armistice, excluding all countries that could help peacefully resolve the Korean issue from the meeting, leaving the countries on the "two sides" of the armistice to conduct face-to-face negotiations.
    Why does the United States advocate such a form of political conference? As the British "Manchester Guardian" and the Indian "National Herald" pointed out: it is to "more openly assert its own views" and to "limit the effectiveness of the political conference," to put it more clearly, it is to facilitate manipulation and sabotage of the political conference, and to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    During the discussion, the proposals of the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea were widely supported. Even the United States' closest "allies," such as Britain and France, agreed with the round-table conference format and did not agree with turning the political conference into a "political Panmunjom meeting" or composing the political conference "of opposing sides." As for the United States' proposal, it generally did not receive support. Even the public opinion of countries participating in the "fifteen-nation proposal" concocted by the United States criticized the United States' proposal. Even the conservative British "Observer" said indignantly: "At present, the attitude of the United States is difficult to explain by purely rational standards."
    When the United States could not find many reasons to defend its proposal, it found some so-called reasons to oppose the round-table conference. But none of these reasons can stand. The United States insisted that if the political conference were held in the form of a round-table conference, the veto power of South Korea's Syngman Rhee would be cancelled. This is completely absurd, because the statement of the Chinese and North Korean governments on the composition of the political conference clearly stated that any resolution of the political conference must be agreed upon by both sides of the Korean armistice to be established. Isn't the Syngman Rhee government part of one side of the armistice? The United States also insisted that if the political conference were held in the form of a round-table conference, it would limit the number of countries on the United Nations forces side attending the political conference. This so-called reason is equally untenable, because the statement of our government has clearly stated that any country that participated in the war in Korea with troops as part of the United Nations forces can be considered as a party to the armistice to participate in the meeting. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea also fully agreed with this point in its statement. Can this be said to be a restriction on the number of countries on the United Nations forces side participating in the political conference? The United States government insisted that if the political conference adopted a round-table conference format, it might expand the agenda of the meeting, so that it would affect the resolution of the Korean issue. This is even more unworthy of refuting, because the Chinese and North Korean governments have pointed out in their statements that the political conference should first negotiate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, including the United Nations forces and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and then discuss other issues. In this way, the political conference will first solve the Korean issue. How can it be said that it will affect the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue?
    After discovering that its proposal did not receive much support, and its sophistry was not agreed to by its vassal states, the United States launched a series of activities in the United Nations and within various vassal states to force these countries to submit to the United States' proposal. It even brought the running dog Syngman Rhee's so-called "Minister of Foreign Affairs" Byun Young-tae into the General Assembly, directing him to rant against India, increasing pressure on the United States' "allies," attempting to use such despicable and dirty means to maintain the majority it has always held hostage in the United Nations, in order to start the voting machine and impose its barbarous and unreasonable proposal on the United Nations. On August 27 and 28, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations General Assembly plenary meeting voted. The result of the vote was that although the United States' "fifteen-nation proposal" was barely passed, it was by no means the "great victory" boasted by the United States' propaganda machine. On the contrary, the result of the vote proved that the United States was in an unprecedentedly isolated position in the United Nations.
    Let us study the voting record: Although the "fifteen-nation proposal" was passed, only forty-three votes were in favor of this proposal. Despite the result of a round of threats and inducements by the United States, it only collected slightly more votes than necessary to pass. At the same time, the vote on the proposal of the Soviet Union's participation in the political conference, which was passed by the United Nations General Assembly, received fifty-five votes in favor from the General Assembly, which means that there were twelve more votes supporting the Soviet Union's participation in the meeting than those supporting the United States' proposal. Due to the United States' arrogant opposition, the proposal for India's participation in the political conference was not voted on at the United Nations General Assembly plenary meeting, but the vote on this proposal in the Political Committee is enough to illustrate the United States' isolation. According to the voting record, only twenty-one votes were against India's participation in the political conference, while twenty-seven votes were in favor of India's participation in the political conference, and eleven abstained. It is especially worth pointing out that among the countries that voted against, apart from the United States, as the United States' "New York World-Telegram and Sun" admitted, "they are merely some insignificant countries." Except for Greece, all twelve countries in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, the main war machine manipulated by the United States, did not support the United States. Even among the fifteen countries that sent troops to invade Korea with the United States, only the puppet Greece and the vassal Colombia cast a vote for the United States. This is the so-called "great victory" of the American propagandists, who are accustomed to putting on a brave face. It is worth noting that, as revealed by Associated Press reporter Roberts: without the United States' "big stick" and "dollars" "exerting strong and unwelcome pressure on its friends," it is unimaginable to achieve such a so-called "great victory." According to Roberts: "For example, Turkey and the Philippines decided to abstain when they really wanted to vote in favor of India (participating in the political conference)." Roberts also admitted: The United States "suffered deep wounds" while achieving these so-called "victories." "The cracks left by the United States' pressure tactics may remain for a long time to come and poison it when other issues arise." "New York Times" reporter Hamilton said more clearly about the United States' situation in this United Nations General Assembly: "The United States is in a difficult position that it has never been in since the United Nations began working seven and a half years ago." Even Dulles, who is known for boasting, lying, and reversing black and white, had to express "regret" in the face of such a cold reality.
    Resolving international disputes through peaceful consultations has been approved and supported by more and more countries and clear-headed politicians. This is the general trend of historical development, and no country can resist it. The more the United States refuses peaceful consultations and the more it tries to maintain international tension, the more it will inevitably fall into isolation. This can be said to be a certain law.
    The peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is an urgent issue related to the interests of people all over the world, and how the political conference is composed and how it is conducted has a major relationship with whether the Korean issue can be resolved smoothly. Therefore, the Chinese and North Korean people and all people in the world who advocate peace in Korea should continue to fight against all the conspiracies and tricks of the United States, strive for the convening of the political conference on a sound and reasonable basis, and strive for a thorough and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    美国在联合国的空前孤立
    沛文
    从八月十七日到八月二十八日，第七届联合国大会召开了最后一次会议，讨论了政治会议的组成问题。十二天会议的结果，再一次向全世界证明：由于赞成朝鲜问题和平解决的国家越来越多，因此，千方百计地企图保持国际紧张局势的美国在联合国中的地位空前的孤立了。
    关于政治会议的组成，有两种主张。苏联和中朝两国坚决主张政治会议应采取有关国家共同协商的圆桌会议的形式，按照这一主张，除了停战双方的国家参加，还应有其他关心朝鲜问题和平解决的国家参加。只有这样，才能保证政治会议在和平协商的空气中进行，也才能保证政治会议对和平解决朝鲜问题作出更有效的贡献，这是完全符合在平等协商的基础上解决国际争端的原则的，也是对巩固远东与世界和平极其有利的。而美国一手包办的所谓“十五国提案”，却反对政治会议采取圆桌会议的形式，无理地把参加会议的国家只限于停战“双方”，所有能够帮助朝鲜问题和平解决的国家都被排斥在会议之外，让停战“双方”的国家，进行面对面的谈判。
    美国为什么要主张这样一种形式的政治会议呢？正像英国“曼彻斯特卫报”和印度“国民先驱报”所指出的：是为了“更公然地自作主张”，是为了“限制政治会议的效用”，说得更明白一点，就是为了便于操纵和破坏政治会议，为了阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    在讨论过程中，苏联和中朝两国的主张，受到了广泛的赞同。甚至美国最要好的“盟国”像英国和法国也是同意圆桌会议的形式的，不赞成把政治会议变成“政治上的板门店会议”，不赞成政治会议“由对立双方组成”。至于美国的主张则普遍地得不到支持。甚至参加美国包办的“十五国提案”国家的舆论也对美国的主张加以抨击，连英国保守的“观察家报”都愤愤不平地说：“目前美国的态度很难用纯粹理性的标准加以解释。”
    当美国不能找出很多理由来为自己的主张辩护时，他就找了一些所谓理由来反对圆桌会议。但这些理由是没有一个能够成立的。美国硬说要是政治会议按照圆桌会议的形式来开的话，南朝鲜李承晚的否决权就被取消了。这完全是无稽之谈，因为中朝两国政府关于政治会议组成问题的声明中明确提出：政治会议的任何决议，必须得到朝鲜停战双方的一致同意才能成立，难道李承晚政府不是属于停战的一方吗？美国还硬说，政治会议要采取圆桌会议来开的话，会限制了联合国军方面出席政治会议的国家的数目。这个所谓理由同样无法立足，因为我国政府的声明已经明白提出：凡以军队参加联合国军在朝鲜进行战争的国家，可被考虑作为停战的一方参加会议，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的声明中对这一点也完全表示同意。这能够说是对联合国军方面参加政治会议的国家数目的限制吗？美国政府又硬说要是政治会议采取圆桌会议的形式，可能扩大会议的议程，以致所谓会影响到对朝鲜问题的解决。这更不值得一驳，因为中朝两国政府声明中已经指出：政治会议应该先行协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，包括联合国军及中国人民志愿军在内，及和平解决朝鲜问题，然后再谈其他问题。这样，政治会议首先解决的就是朝鲜问题，如何能说会影响朝鲜问题的和平解决呢？
    美国在发现它的主张得不到多少支持，它的诡辩也得不到它的仆从国家的同意之后，就在联合国中和各个仆从国家之内，展开了一系列的强迫这些国家屈从美国主张的活动，甚至把走狗李承晚的所谓“外务部长官”卞荣泰带进大会，指使他狂叫反对印度，增加对美国“盟国”的压力，企图用这种卑鄙龌龊的手段来维持它在联合国中向来挟持的多数。以便开动表决机器把自己的蛮横无理的主张，强加于联合国。八月二十七日和二十八日，联合国大会政治委员会和联合国大会全体会议进行了表决，表决的结果，虽然勉强通过了美国的“十五国提案”，但是这决不像美国宣传机器吹嘘的那样，是一次什么“大胜利”，恰恰相反，表决的结果，证明了美国在联合国中陷入空前孤立的地位。
    让我们研究一下表决的记录吧：“十五国提案”虽然通过了，但是赞成这个提案的只有四十三票，尽管美国威吓利诱了一通的结果，也不过搜罗了比必要通过的票数稍稍多了一点。而同时在联合国大会通过的关于苏联参加政治会议的提案的表决，却获得了大会五十五票的赞成，这就是说支持苏联参加会议的比支持美国提案的要多十二票。由于美国横蛮的反对，印度参加政治会议的提案没有在联合国大会全体会议上表决，但是，这个提案在政治委员会的表决也就足够说明美国孤立的情况了。根据投票纪录，反对印度参加政治会议的只有二十一票，而赞成印度参加政治会议的却有二十七票，弃权的也有十一票。尤其值得指出的是，投反对票的国家中，除去美国而外，像美国的“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”所承认的“仅仅是一些无足轻重的国家”。除了希腊而外，美国操纵的主要战争机器北大西洋侵略集团中的十二个国家全部没有支持美国，甚至和美国一道派遣军队侵略朝鲜的十五个国家中，也只有傀儡希腊和附庸哥伦比亚给美国投了一票。这就是惯于打肿脸充胖子的美国宣传家们的所谓“大胜利”。值得注意的是，像美联社记者罗伯茨透露的：要是没有美国的“大棒”和“美元”“对它的朋友施以强大的和不受欢迎的压力”的话，要取得所谓这样的“大胜利”是不可想像的。据罗伯茨说：“比如，土耳其和菲律宾就是在它们真正想投票赞成印度（参加政治会议）时决定弃权的。”罗伯茨又承认：美国在取得这些所谓“胜利”的同时“遭到很深的创伤”。“美国的压力策略所留下来的裂痕可能在今后长期留下来，而在其他问题发生时毒害它。”“纽约时报”的记者汉密尔顿关于美国在这次联合国大会中的处境，更说得明白：“美国处于自从联合国在七年半以前开始工作以来从未有过的困难境地”。就是以吹牛撒谎、颠倒黑白著称的杜勒斯，在如此冷酷的现实面前，也不得不表示“遗憾”了。
    用和平协商办法解决国际争端，已经被越来越多的国家和头脑清醒的政治家们赞成和支持，这是历史发展的大势所趋，任何国家都不能抗拒。美国愈是拒绝和平协商，愈是企图保持国际紧张局势，它就必然会愈加陷于孤立，这可以说是肯定的规律。
    朝鲜问题的和平解决，是有关全世界人民利益的迫切问题，而政治会议的如何组成和如何进行又和朝鲜问题能否顺利解决有着重大关系。因此，中朝人民和全世界主张朝鲜和平的人们应该为反对美国的一切阴谋诡计，争取政治会议在健全合理的基础上召开，争取朝鲜问题的彻底和平解决而继续奋斗。
