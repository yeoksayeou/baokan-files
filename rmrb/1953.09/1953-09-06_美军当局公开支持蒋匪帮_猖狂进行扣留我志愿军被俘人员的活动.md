Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 5th. Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: With the open support and assistance of the U.S. military authorities, the Kuomintang bandit gang's criminal activities of forcibly detaining Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war have become even more rampant.

It is reported that the so-called delegation dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, led by the special agent head Fang Zhi, has completed its conspiracy to force the detention of prisoners of war in the U.S. POW camp on Jeju Island, and left Jeju Island on the afternoon of September 2nd to arrive in Busan, where it will carry out its same activities in the U.S. prisoner of war hospitals. The news said that during the seven days in the Jeju Island POW camp, these Chiang Kai-shek special agents "worked day and night" to force our prisoners of war to listen to speeches and conduct individual talks, openly threatening them not to request repatriation and coercing them to go to Taiwan.

It is reported that under the planning of these Chiang Kai-shek special agent leaders, Chiang Kai-shek special agents lurking among the prisoners of war had already submitted a presumptuous demand to General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, on August 27th, aimed at sabotaging the smooth completion of the task of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The Chiang Kai-shek special agents demanded that after the prisoners of war are handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody, they should still be allowed to use their original reactionary organizations to control and persecute prisoners of war, hang Chiang Kai-shek's national flags, force prisoners of war to listen to Chiang Kai-shek's broadcasts, read Chiang Kai-shek's books and newspapers, and allow the Chiang Kai-shek gang to directly dispatch special agents to the prisoner of war camps under the custody of the Neutral Nations to carry out various sabotage activities. The Chiang Kai-shek special agents also demanded that after the prisoners of war are handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody, they can arbitrarily use the excuse that the Korean-Chinese side "has conspiracies or aggressive acts" to disrupt the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side; and they can arbitrarily use the excuse that the personnel or troops of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission "assist" the Korean-Chinese side to "replace" the personnel or members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. These presumptuous demands made by the Chiang Kai-shek special agents posing as prisoners of war were planned with the support and assistance of the U.S. side. The U.S. side also released rumors to help the Chiang Kai-shek special agents engage in rampant extortion, saying that the prisoners of war "will decide whether they are willing to be transported to the demilitarized zone based on this reply." This cannot but make people suspect that the U.S. side is attempting to use this completely unacceptable demand put forward by the Chiang Kai-shek special agents to directly undermine the armistice agreement and refuse to hand over the prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in order to more smoothly achieve the evil goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

At the same time, it is reported that the agents of the Chiang Kai-shek gang stationed in Washington, Tokyo, and Busan are stepping up their planning with the U.S. side for the evil conspiracy to undermine the implementation of the armistice agreement and forcibly detain prisoners of war.

People here pointed out that with the open support and assistance of the U.S. side, the increasingly rampant conspiracy of the Kuomintang bandit gang to forcibly detain prisoners of war puts the prisoner of war agreement in the armistice agreement in danger of being severely undermined. The U.S. side must immediately stop this sabotage activity and take responsible and effective measures to expel all the special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandit gangs lurking in the prisoner of war camps, so that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can smoothly begin and complete its task.

### 美军当局公开支持蒋匪帮  猖狂进行扣留我志愿军被俘人员的活动

    美军当局公开支持蒋匪帮
    猖狂进行扣留我志愿军被俘人员的活动
    【新华社开城五日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：在美军当局公开支持和协助下，国民党匪帮强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员的罪恶活动更加猖狂了。
    有消息说，蒋匪帮派遣的由特务头子方治率领的所谓代表团，在济州岛美方战俘营内策划强迫扣留战俘的阴谋已经完毕，并且在九月二日下午离开济州岛到达釜山，将在美方战俘医院内进行其同样活动。消息说，这批蒋匪特务在济州岛战俘营的七天内，“日夜努力”来强迫我方被俘人员听演说和进行个别谈话，公开恫吓他们不得要求遣返，并胁迫他们到台湾去。
    有消息说，在这些蒋匪特务头子的策划下，潜伏在战俘中间的蒋匪特务已在八月二十七日提出了破坏中立国遣返委员会顺利完成其任务、旨在强迫扣留战俘的狂妄要求，交给联合国军总司令克拉克。蒋匪特务要求在战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管以后，仍然允许他们利用其原有的反动组织来控制和迫害战俘、张挂蒋匪国旗、强迫战俘收听蒋匪广播、阅读蒋匪书报，和允许蒋匪帮直接派遣特务到中立国看管战俘的战俘营去进行各种破坏活动。蒋匪特务还要求在战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管以后，可以任意藉口朝中方面“有阴谋或有进攻行为”，破坏朝中方面的解释工作；并且可以任意藉口中立国遣返委员会的人员或军队“协助”朝中方面，而“撤换”中立国遣返委员会的人员或成员。这些冒充战俘的蒋匪特务提出的这种破坏停战协定的狂妄要求，是在美方的支持和协助下策划的。美方并且放出谣言，帮蒋匪特务大肆讹诈，说甚么战俘“将根据这答复来决定他们是否愿意被运到非军事区去”。这不能不使人怀疑，美方是在企图利用蒋匪特务提出的这种完全不能接受的要求，来直接破坏停战协定，拒绝把战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会，以便更顺利地达到强迫扣留战俘的罪恶目的。
    与此同时，有消息说，蒋匪帮驻华盛顿、东京和釜山的代理人正在与美国方面加紧策划破坏停战协定的实施和强迫扣留战俘的罪恶阴谋。
    此间人士指出：在美方的公开支持和协助下，国民党匪帮愈益嚣张的策划强迫扣留战俘的罪恶阴谋，使停战协定中有关战俘的协议面临着被严重破坏的危险。美方必须立即停止这种破坏活动，并采取负责和有效的措施，将潜伏在战俘营里的所有蒋介石和李承晚匪帮的特务分子逐出战俘营，以便中立国遣返委员会得以顺利地开始和完成其任务。
