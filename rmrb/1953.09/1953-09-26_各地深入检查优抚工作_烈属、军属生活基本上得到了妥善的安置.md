Throughout the country, in accordance with the notice from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government regarding strengthening preferential treatment work to commemorate the "August 1st" Army Day, widespread inspections of the progress of preferential treatment work have been carried out. According to statistics from nine provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, and Henan, and four cities, including Tianjin, a total of thirty-six inspection teams were dispatched. Some special districts and counties also devoted certain efforts, combining drought resistance and disaster prevention, to conduct in-depth inspections of preferential treatment work in districts and townships.

From this inspection, it can be seen that the preferential treatment work in many regions has been done very well, creating a set of practical and feasible working methods. The lives of families of martyrs, military personnel, and demobilized soldiers in rural and urban areas have been largely properly settled. In rural areas, due to the implementation of a fixed substitute farming system in most regions, the output of families of martyrs and military personnel has gradually stabilized. Since the implementation of the fixed substitute farming system in 1951, the model substitute farming village of Beizhao Bazhuang in Hebei Province has seen an increase in the yield of substitute farmed land every year. At present, the village has established a fixed system for preferential treatment work, with a general inspection of preferential treatment work throughout the village every month. In terms of production loans, families of martyrs and military personnel receive priority consideration, with each household of ordinary people receiving a loan of 40,000 yuan, and households in need among families of martyrs and military personnel receiving a loan of 150,000 yuan. Village cadres are also assigned to take care of household chores for families of martyrs and military personnel, providing them with ideological education and helping them develop production plans. As a result, the morale of families of martyrs and military personnel is constantly maintained at a high level, and they consciously engage in production. In Jiangxi Province, Gao'an, Wannian, Yiyang and other counties have signed substitute farming contracts with families of martyrs and military personnel this year. After the substitute farming team works on the land of families of martyrs and military personnel, they insert a sign stating the number of acres of substitute farming, the situation of intensive farming, and requiring the masses and cadres to inspect. While implementing the fixed substitute farming system, most regions have also promoted new cultivation methods on substitute farmed land, practicing intensive farming. As a result, the land of many families of martyrs and military personnel has achieved a bumper harvest. In Shenze and Handan counties, Hebei Province, 1,462.8 mu of substitute farmed land belonging to 267 families of martyrs and military personnel in fifteen villages were mostly plowed once, harrowed twice, and hoed three times, resulting in relatively high yields (only 114.8 mu of land had poor crop growth and lower yields due to lack of fertilizer or poor soil quality). According to recent inspections in Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Rehe and other provinces in Northeast China, 20 to 30 percent of the substitute farmed land is cultivated according to new cultivation methods. Due to the improvement of cultivation methods by the Wang Yujun mutual aid group, the six mu and four fen of land belonging to Zou Hongguo, a military family in Harna Village, Beipiao County, Rehe Province, reached a yield of 1,300 jin per mu last year, and it is estimated that the yield this year can be increased to 1,600 jin. Families of martyrs and military personnel in various regions are satisfied with this year's substitute farming work, and generally reflect that "it is getting better year by year." Toubao Town, a first-class model township for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of military personnel in Fujian Province, has added five sets of clothes and bought fifty jin of fertilizer for the field after the bumper harvest of early rice this year. Lin Qingfa, a military family who often lacked food in the past, now has enough food to eat this year. In general, families of martyrs and military personnel have become more stable in their moods due to improved living conditions. They all sincerely thank the government and the masses for their love and care.

During the inspection of preferential treatment work, various regions also inspected the resettlement of demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns. According to inspections in Hebei and Shandong provinces, except for a few demobilized soldiers with driving skills, most have been properly resettled. Taking Shexian County, Hebei Province, as an example, the twenty demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns without houses or land have been allocated houses and land after returning to their hometowns; those who lacked houses and land have also been supplemented with housing and farmland. In addition to providing material assistance to demobilized soldiers, they are also encouraged to participate in various social activities. The vast majority of demobilized soldiers have become familiar with production work in a short period of time after returning to the countryside, and many demobilized soldiers have become skilled in production. Twenty-three demobilized soldiers in Guanfang Township, Shexian County, Hebei Province, generally showed great enthusiasm in production. Liu Wenfang, a demobilized soldier, had a bumper harvest of wheat this year, and he bought a donkey and a pig. The vast majority of demobilized soldiers who have returned to the cities have found jobs. They can all modelly abide by labor discipline and enthusiastically participate in the economic construction of the motherland in their new economic work positions.

This inspection also found some shortcomings in the work of substitute farming and resettling demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns in some areas: in the process of rectifying substitute farming work, some areas excessively reduced the scope of substitute farming, so that some families of martyrs and military personnel who should have enjoyed substitute farming did not receive reasonable treatment. After inspection, this shortcoming is being gradually corrected. As for the organizational form of substitute farming, some areas in Zhejiang, Fujian and other provinces are in a state of temporary dispatch of labor. In some old liberated areas in North China, the fixed substitute farming system began to loosen this year. Some areas adopted the method of allocating grain according to work points, without a fixed substitute farming system, which resulted in the phenomenon of military families sitting and eating substitute farmed grain. There is a lack of fertilizer in some substitute farmed land. According to a survey of two townships in the suburbs of Beijing, more than 55 percent of the 37.7 mu of land lacked fertilizer. The lack of fertilizer affected the yield. According to a survey of three villages in North China, the yield of land belonging to families of martyrs and military personnel will be about 7 percent lower than that of the masses. In terms of resettling demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns, there are also some improper things. At present, a small number of demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns have not been properly resettled in terms of life and work, and their illnesses have not been well treated, which has led to a situation in which some demobilized soldiers are not at ease in agricultural production and blindly flow to the cities. According to statistics from Shandong Province from January to June this year, 1,209 demobilized soldiers went to the cities to find work.

Some areas have done a relatively poor job in ideological education for families of martyrs and military personnel. Therefore, some families of martyrs and military personnel have a dependence mentality. For example, a military family in Xintai County, Shandong, is unwilling to work and relies on the government's substitute farming and relief. After receiving relief grain, they eat and drink extravagantly, and have sold 8.3 mu of the 15.5 mu of land allocated during the land reform. According to a survey of Mishan and Jixi counties in Songjiang Province, Northeast China, a considerable number of young and middle-aged women in families of martyrs and military personnel do not participate in production. Some military families say: "It's the same whether you work or not, anyway, there is government relief and substitute farming by the masses." And the township cadres did not actively educate them, so that they felt the glory of labor.

In order to further improve the autumn harvest and autumn planting work for families of martyrs and military personnel, some areas with poor substitute farming work have formulated improvement plans; some provinces and cities have studied and deployed preferential treatment work.

    各地深入检查优抚工作
    烈属、军属生活基本上得到了妥善的安置
    全国各地根据中央人民政府内务部关于纪念“八一”建军节加强优抚工作的通知，普遍检查了优抚工作的进行情况。据河北、山东、湖北、河南等九个省和天津等四个市的统计，共派出了三十六个检查组。有些专署和县也都抽出一定力量，结合抗旱防灾深入区乡对优抚工作进行了检查。
    从这次检查中可以看出，许多地区的优抚工作做得很好，创造了一套切实可行的工作方法，农村和城市的烈、军属和转业军人的生活，基本上得到了妥善的安置。在农村中由于多数地区实行了固定代耕制，烈、军属的产量已逐步稳固下来。河北省代耕模范村——北赵八庄自一九五一年实行固定代耕制以后，烈、军属的代耕土地年年增产。目前该村在优抚工作方面已订出固定的制度，每月全村普遍检查一次优抚工作。在生产贷款方面烈、军属可得到优先照顾，群众每户贷四万元，烈、军属中的困难户每户贷十五万元。村干部还分片负责照顾烈、军属家务，他们经常向烈、军属进行思想教育，帮助制定生产计划。烈、军属的思想情绪因而经常保持饱满，自觉地从事生产。江西省高安、万年、弋阳等县在今年和烈、军属订了代耕合同，代耕组在烈、军属的土地上工作后，插上一块牌子，上面写明代耕的亩数、精耕细作的情况，要求群众和干部来检查。在实行固定代耕制的同时，多数地区还在代耕地上推广了新耕作法，精耕细作，许多烈、军属的土地因而获得了丰收。河北省深泽、邯郸两县十五个村二百六十七户烈、军属的一千四百六十二亩八分代耕地，大都做到犁一遍，耙二遍、锄三遍，收获量都相当高（仅有一百十四亩八分地因缺肥或土质不良，庄稼长得不大好，产量较低）。东北地区的松江、黑龙江、热河等省，据最近检查，有百分之二十到三十的代耕地都按照新耕作法耕种。热河省北票县哈尔脑村军属邹洪国的六亩四分地，由于代耕的王玉军互助组改进了耕作方法，去年每亩产量达到一千三百斤，估计今年的产量可提高到一千六百斤。各地烈、军属对今年的代耕工作是满意的，普遍反映：“一年比一年好”。福建省一等拥军优属模范乡透堡镇，今年早稻丰收后军属黄思曾已添置了五套衣服，还买了五十斤肥田粉。往年经常缺粮的军属林庆法今年已有足够的粮食吃。一般烈、军属均因生活得到改善，情绪更趋安定，他们都衷心感谢政府和群众对他们的爱护和关怀。
    在优抚工作检查中，各地还检查了回乡转业军人的安置情况。据河北、山东两省的检查，除少数有驾驶技术的转业军人外，一般都得到了妥善的安置。以河北省涉县为例，无房无地的二十个回乡转业军人，回乡后已分得了房屋和土地；缺房少地的，也补给了住房和耕地。除在物质上给转业军人以帮助外，还吸收他们参加各种社会活动。绝大部分的转业军人在回到农村以后，在短期内就熟悉了生产工作，许多转业军人已成为生产上的能手。河北省涉县关防乡二十三名转业军人，在生产中普遍表现了很大的积极性，转业军人刘文芳的小麦今年丰收，他买了驴子还买了猪。回到城市里的转业军人，绝大部分有了职业。他们在新的经济工作岗位上都能模范地遵守劳动纪律，热情地参加祖国的经济建设。
    这次检查也发现若干地区在代耕工作和安置回乡转业军人等方面还存在一些缺点：有少数地区在整顿代耕工作中，过分地压缩了代耕面，使某些应享受代耕的烈、军属没有得到合理的待遇。经检查后，这个缺点正在逐步纠正中。至于代耕的组织形式，浙江、福建等省的部分地区处在临时派工的状态中。华北等地的一部分老解放区，固定代耕制今年开始松了下来，有的地区采取按工筹粮的办法，没有固定代耕制，因而发生了军属坐吃代耕粮的现象。某些地区的代耕土地有缺乏肥料的现象，据北京市郊二个乡镇的调查，三十七亩七分地中缺肥的就占百分之五十五以上。由于肥料不足，影响了产量。据华北区三个村的调查，烈、军属土地的产量将低于群众百分之七左右。在安置回乡转业军人方面，同样发现有不妥的地方。目前，尚有少数回乡转业军人在生活上和工作上没有得到妥善的安置，对他们的疾病没有很好地给予治疗，以致造成一部分转业军人不安心农业生产、盲目地流向城市的现象。据山东省今年一月至六月的统计，到城市找工作的转业军人达一千二百零九人。
    有些地区对烈、军属的思想教育工作做得比较差，因此，一部分烈、军属有依赖思想。如山东新泰县有一个军属，不愿意劳动，依靠政府的代耕和救济，领到救济粮后大吃大喝，土地改革时分得的十五亩半地已卖掉八亩三分。据东北松江省密山、鸡西两个县的调查，有相当数量的烈、军属青壮年妇女没有参加生产，有些军属说：“干不干都是一样，反正有政府的救济和群众的代耕。”而乡干部并未积极地对他们进行教育，使他们感到劳动的光荣。
    为了进一步做好烈、军属的秋收秋耕工作，某些代耕工作做得较差的地区，已订出改进计划；有的省、市，对优抚工作作了研究和布置。
