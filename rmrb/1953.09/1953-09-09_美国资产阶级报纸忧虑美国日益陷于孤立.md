Xinhua News Agency, August 8th:

    The disappearance of America's "hydrogen bomb monopoly," the increasing unpopularity of war preparations, the growing pressure from people of all countries for solving international problems through negotiation, and America's isolation in the United Nations General Assembly have made it impossible for the American bourgeoisie to conceal their anxiety.

    "U.S. News & World Report," an important mouthpiece of American monopoly capital, has issued somber tones in almost consecutive issues. The August 28th issue reluctantly mentioned the fact that the Soviet Union has hydrogen bombs, saying, "The fact that Russia has a hydrogen bomb changes the situation, that's for sure." It continued, "The pressure to deal with Russia will become stronger and stronger. Britain insists on trying to deal. France and Italy are the same." Even "The United Nations is actually tending to unite to confront the United States; wanting to force the United States and Russia to negotiate agreements related to the world… This country (the United States) is slowly but surely being isolated and pressured.”

    "U.S. News & World Report" then said, "Neutralism will be more appealing to Europe than before. Britain has self-righteously wanted to act as an 'honest broker' between the United States and Russia. It is trying to stand in the middle in the United Nations. France is evading defense obligations opposed by Russia. Italy, like France, is leaving the European army. More and more the idea is to try to get out of the line of fire..."

    The magazine said in its August 7th issue, "It seems that America's allies are trying in every way to isolate themselves from the United States and go their own way."

    The magazine continued, "The United States is still trying to buy friendship with dollars." But it admitted, "The whole plan to buy friendship is proving to be a big failure."

    Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: According to TASS, Rome, 3rd: The Italian bourgeois newspapers "Corriere della Sera" and "Il Globo" published editorials opposing the ratification of the so-called "European Defense Community" agreement and opposing the establishment of a "European Army."

    "Corriere della Sera" said: "Frankly speaking, the possibility of establishing a European Defense Community is less than one percent. The Americans still believe that this group can be established. But they are the only ones who believe in this; in Europe, everyone holds the opposite view, or at least is skeptical."

    "Corriere della Sera" pointed out that the time for establishing the "European Group" has passed because "the situation has changed: the situation in France has changed, and the situation in Italy after the election has also changed. Most importantly: the entire situation in Europe has changed."

    "Il Globo" said that the idea of establishing a "European Army" is a "utopia that causes many contradictions."

    Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: TASS, New York, 4th: "The Wall Street Journal" published an article by Ray Vicker, an editor of the newspaper, who had just returned from a three-month trip to Latin America. He had spoken with politicians, businessmen, landowners, and farmers in Brazil, Chile, Guatemala, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina.

    Ray Vicker drew attention to the rising tide of movements in Latin America demanding various reforms, and pointed out that these many movements demanding reform have anti-American overtones.

    He further wrote: Because the United States has grasped economic power in Latin America through its investment and trade policies, the people of Latin America are dissatisfied with the United States. The average person often accuses the Americans of being insincere when they preach democracy. Moreover, it is also hypocritical when it promotes "free enterprise." For example, Venezuelans point out that the United States first talks about free trade, and then restricts oil imports. Chileans say that American free enterprise only advocates a free market for copper when it suits the United States. When the Korean War started and copper prices rose, the United States cut the stipulated maximum price for purchasing foreign copper by 27.5 cents per pound and refused to increase it again. And today, when prices are falling, the United States wants Chile to sell copper at market prices and refuses to discuss the price issue. The people of Bolivia complain that their tin transactions with the United States are also conducted in this way. When market prices rise, the United States stipulates price limits, and only when prices are trending downward does the United States advocate free trade.

    The people of Uruguay are dissatisfied with the tariff policy of the United States.

    Latin Americans complain that these arrogant acts of American trade policy have a direct and harmful impact on the economic welfare of the people of Latin American countries.

### 美国资产阶级报纸忧虑美国日益陷于孤立

    美国资产阶级报纸忧虑美国日益陷于孤立
    【新华社八日讯】美国的“氢弹垄断”的消失，备战政策的日益不得人心，各国人民要求用协商方式解决国际问题的压力的加强，美国在联合国大会上的孤立，使得美国资产阶级掩藏不住他们的焦灼。
    美国垄断资本的重要喉舌“美国新闻与世界报道”在差不多接连的两期中，连续发出低沉的调子。八月二十八日出版的一期无可奈何地提到苏联已有氢弹的事实，并说：“俄国拥有氢弹使局势改观，这是确定无疑的”。它继续说：“要求和俄国打交道的压力会越来越强。英国坚持要设法试打交道。法国和意大利也是一样。”甚至“联合国实际上也趋向联合起来和美国对抗；想压迫美国和俄国谈判关系世界的协议……这个国家（美国）正在缓慢而肯定地被孤立起来，受到逼迫。”
    “美国新闻与世界报道”接着说：“中立主义对欧洲将比以前更有号召力。英国已沽名钓誉地想在美国与俄国之间充当‘老实掮客’。它正设法在联合国中站在中间。法国在逃避俄国所反对的防务义务。意大利像法国一样，在离开欧洲军。愈来愈多的想法是设法脱出火线……”
    该刊在八月七日的一期中又说：“看来美国的盟国正努力以一切方法使它们自己与美国隔离，独自走它们自己的路。”
    该刊继续说：“美国仍然在试用美元来收买友谊。”可是它承认：“收买友谊的整个计划正证明是个大失败。”
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社罗马三日讯：意大利资产阶级报纸“晚邮报”和“环球报”发表社论，反对批准所谓“欧洲防务集团”协定，反对成立“欧洲军”。
    “晚邮报”说：“坦白说，成立欧洲防务集团的可能性不到百分之一。美国人仍然相信这个集团可以成立。但是相信这件事情的只有他们了；在欧洲，大家都持相反的看法，至少是抱怀疑态度。”
    “晚邮报”指出，成立“欧洲集团”的时机已经过去了，因为“局势有了改变：法国的局势改变了，选举后意大利的局势也改变了。最重要的是：欧洲整个局势已经有了改变。”
    “环球报”说，成立“欧洲军”的想法是“乌托邦，它引起了许多矛盾”。
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社纽约四日讯：“华尔街日报”发表了刚在拉丁美洲旅行三个月归来的该报编辑雷·维克的一篇文章。他曾与巴西、智利、危地马拉、委内瑞拉、秘鲁、玻利维亚和阿根廷的政治家、商人、地主和农民谈过话。
    雷·维克促使大家注意，在拉丁美洲要求进行种种改革的运动正在高涨，并指出这许多要求改革的运动都带有反美色彩。
    他进一步写道：由于美国通过它的投资与贸易政策而在拉丁美洲掌握经济大权，拉丁美洲人民对美国是不满的。一般人时常指责说，美国人在宣传民主时是口是心非的。而且，它在宣传“自由企业”的时候，也是伪善的。譬如委内瑞拉人指出，美国先谈论自由贸易，然后又对石油进口加以限制。智利人说，美国的自由企业只在自由市场对美国合适的时候，才主张要铜的自由市场。当朝鲜战争开始，铜价上涨的时候，美国把规定收购外国铜的每磅最高价格削减了两角七分五，并拒绝再增加。而今天当价格下跌时，美国又要智利按市场价格卖出铜，并拒绝讨论价格问题。玻利维亚人民抱怨说，他们与美国的锡交易也是这样进行的，在市场价格上涨时，美国规定限价，只有在价格有下跌趋势时，美国才主张自由买卖。
    乌拉圭人民不满的是美国的关税政策。
    拉丁美洲人抱怨说，美国贸易政策的这些狂妄行为，对拉丁美洲各国人民的经济福利都有直接有害的影响。
