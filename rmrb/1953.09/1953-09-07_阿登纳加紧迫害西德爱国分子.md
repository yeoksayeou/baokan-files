Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 6th: The "Truth" newspaper correspondent in Berlin, P. Naumov, reported: With the approach of the Federal Assembly elections, the fascist terror in West Germany is becoming increasingly rampant. Naumov wrote: In West Germany, dissatisfaction with the Bonn government's anti-people policies is rising, which has shocked Adenauer and his American backers. They fear that the results of the West German Bundestag elections on September 6th will be unfavorable to them. Therefore, the Adenauer government and the American authorities in West Germany are using all means to exert brutal pressure on voters, intimidate them, anesthetize them, and force them to vote for Adenauer.

The ruling parties, funded by American monopoly capital and the Ruhr corporations colluding with them, are conducting election campaigns entirely in the American style. They widely use the most shameless methods of cajoling and deceiving voters, and use provocations, blackmail, and bribery to intimidate their opponents.

Naumov pointed out: Terrorist tactics are mainly aimed at those who steadfastly and selflessly protect the national interests of Germany - the Communists. Thousands of German patriots have been imprisoned on the eve of the election. Police and fascist bandits attacked Communist election rallies. They have repeatedly created shocking provocations to create excuses to ban and dissolve progressive organizations.

Adenauer not only has the police at his disposal, but also many fascist thug units, who attack Communist gatherings, using knives and other weapons to intimidate voters. Adenauer's courts are also actively participating in preventing the election campaigns of West German peace-loving patriotic forces, throwing thousands of patriots into prison.

Naumov pointed out: While the Bonn authorities are brutally persecuting democratic organizations, they are enthusiastically giving halls, radio stations, and other campaign propaganda tools to open Hitlerites. At the same time, the latter openly demanded the "revival of Germany" in the fascist spirit, and threatened that once they came to power, they would barbarically persecute democratic forces.

    阿登纳加紧迫害西德爱国分子
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：“真理报”驻柏林记者普·瑙莫夫报道：随着联邦议院选举的临近，西德的法西斯恐怖越来越猖狂了。瑙莫夫写道：在西德，对于波恩政府的反人民政策的不满情绪在日益高涨，这使得阿登纳和他的美国撑腰人大感震惊。他们害怕九月六日西德议会下院联邦议院选举的结果会对他们不利。因此，阿登纳政府和西德美国当局便使用一切办法向选民施以残暴的压力，威吓他们，麻醉他们，并迫使他们投阿登纳的票。
    美国垄断资本以及与它们勾结的鲁尔大公司资助的统治党派，完全按照美国方式来进行竞选运动。它们广泛地使用最无耻的笼络和欺骗选民的办法，并且使用挑衅、讹诈和贿赂手段，恐吓它们的反对者。
    瑙莫夫指出：恐怖手段主要是针对最坚定和忘我地保护着德国民族利益的人——共产党人的。成千的德国爱国者在选举前夕被囚禁了。警察和法西斯匪徒攻击共产党的竞选集会。它们接二连三地制造惊人的挑衅事件，以便制造藉口来禁止和解散进步组织。
    阿登纳手下不仅有警察，同时还有许许多多法西斯暴徒部队，他们向共产党集会组织攻击，他们使用刀子和其他武器，恐吓选民。阿登纳的法庭也积极参加阻止西德爱好和平的爱国力量的竞选运动，把成千的爱国者关入监牢。
    瑙莫夫指出：波恩当局一方面残酷地迫害民主组织，另一方面热烈地把礼堂、电台和其他竞选宣传手段让给公开的希特勒分子使用。同时，后者公开要求以法西斯精神“复兴德国”，并扬言一旦他们当权，他们将野蛮地迫害民主势力。
