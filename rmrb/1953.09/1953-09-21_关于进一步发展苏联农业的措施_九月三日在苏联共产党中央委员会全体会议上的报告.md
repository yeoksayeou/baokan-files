The great achievements of the Soviet people in the development of socialist industry have enabled the Communist Party and the government to tackle the problem of producing a wide range of consumer goods in our country.

The great Lenin taught us: "Large-scale machine industry (which at the same time can transform agriculture) is the only possible material basis for socialism." Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have built a fully developed heavy industry, which is a powerful foundation for the socialist economy. Now, with such a foundation, it is possible to organize a rapid increase and significant expansion in the production of consumer goods by all sectors of the light and food industries, because the main goal and primary task of socialist production is to satisfy to the maximum extent the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the entire society.

However, to organize a rapid increase in the production of consumer goods, it is necessary to develop our agriculture at an accelerated pace.

At the present stage, the most urgent and primary task of the national economy is: while continuing to vigorously develop heavy industry, to achieve a rapid increase in all sectors of agriculture and, within the next two to three years, to significantly increase the supply of grain to the entire population of the country, while ensuring that the material well-being of all collective farmers is raised to a higher level.

Therefore, the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Party considers it necessary to submit to this plenary session for consideration proposals for the implementation of several important and urgent measures to ensure a rapid increase and multifaceted development of agriculture.

(1) The situation in agriculture and the task of producing abundant agricultural products

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the collective farm system, which has decisive advantages over any private agriculture—whether small-scale commodity production or large-scale capitalist production—has been established in the countryside. In the countryside, the world's greatest socialist agricultural system has replaced the old system of 25 million scattered, tiny individual peasant farms—it has developed and consolidated. Now, our country's socialist agricultural system includes 94,000 collective farms, 8,950 machine-tractor stations, and more than 4,700 state farms.

Our country's agriculture is the most mechanized in the world. Everyone knows that in capitalist countries, modern agricultural equipment is concentrated in the hands of a small group of agricultural capitalists, while in the work of the vast majority of working farmers, manual labor and primitive tools prevail.

The Soviet state supplies agriculture with first-class equipment from machine-tractor stations, which enables it to solve the problem of mechanizing the most important agricultural operations. In 1952, the mechanization of collective farm operations was as follows: in sowing grain, 87 percent; in harvesting grain with combines, 70 percent; in plowing fallow land, 96 percent; in autumn plowing, 97 percent; in cotton cultivation, 98 percent; in sugar beet cultivation, 95 percent. The mechanization of agricultural production has greatly lightened the labor of collective farmers; it has enabled our society to save a great deal of labor. It has enabled our country's agriculture to develop according to modern scientific agronomic principles.

The public enterprises of collective farms equipped with modern agricultural machinery are developing and consolidating. The productive forces of socialist agriculture, based on collective farms and state farms, are becoming ever greater, and their commodity output is increasing. For example, from 1926-1927 to 1952-1953, the commodity output of agriculture increased as follows: grain from 10.3 million tons to 40.4 million tons, potatoes from 3 million tons to 12.5 million tons, meat (pork) from 2.4 million tons to 5 million tons, dairy products from 4.3 million tons to 13.2 million tons. Significant achievements have been made in the production of cotton, sugar beets, and other industrial crops. The increase in agricultural production has enabled the socialist state to increase the quantity of agricultural products annually to meet the needs of industry for raw materials and the growing needs of the people for food.

With the consolidation and further development of the public enterprises of collective farms, their wealth is increasing, and the cash and in-kind income of collective farmers is increasing. It is enough to note that the public accumulation fund of collective farms increased by one hundred percent from 1940 to 1952. Today, the actual income of collective farmers is several times higher than that of laboring peasants before the revolution. A profound cultural revolution has taken place in the countryside.

All this proves that the collective farm system has fundamentally changed the production base and the way of life of millions of peasants in accordance with new socialist principles. The collective farm system has opened up a broad path to prosperity and a cultured life for all laboring people in Soviet villages. The alliance of the working class and collective farmers has become an invincible force.

However, we must frankly admit that we have not made good use of the enormous potential in large-scale agricultural production. We have a significant number of backward, even neglected, collective farms and entire districts. In many collective farms and districts, the yield per unit area of crops remains very low. The productivity of agricultural production, especially in livestock products, grain crops, forage crops, potatoes, and vegetables, has increased very slowly. The rate of development of our large-scale socialist industry, the increase in the urban population, and the improvement of the material well-being of the working people are clearly out of balance with the current level of agricultural production.

We can cite several facts to illustrate this. From 1913 to 1952, the total output of large-scale industry in the USSR (calculated at comparable prices) increased by twenty-seven times, and the output of means of production increased by forty-seven times. The development of socialist industry has led to a rapid increase in the urban population: from 1926 to 1952, the urban population increased by more than three times. With the continuous increase in the wealth of socialist society, the material well-being of the working people has also improved. Now, the actual wages of Soviet workers are several times higher than the pre-revolutionary level. This means that our country is becoming more prosperous year by year, and the material well-being of the working people is constantly improving, and therefore, naturally, agriculture is being asked for more and more.

However, the rate of development of socialist agriculture is obviously lagging far behind the rate of industrial development and the growth of the people's demand for consumer goods. It is enough to note that from 1940 to 1952, industrial output increased by 2.3 times, while the total output of agriculture (calculated at comparable prices) increased by only 10 percent.

Our country's grain supply is guaranteed; we have the necessary state reserves, and to a certain extent, we can even export grain; in this sense, we generally satisfy the country's demand for grain. With the improvement of the material well-being of the people, the needs of the people gradually shift from bread to meat and dairy products, vegetables, and fruits. However, it is precisely in these sectors of agriculture that the imbalance between the rapidly growing needs of the people and the level of production has become increasingly apparent in recent years. The backwardness of several important sectors of agriculture has hindered the further development of light industry and the food industry and has obstructed the increase in the income of collective farms and collective farmers. The overall low level of agricultural production and the backwardness of several important sectors of agriculture are due to what?

The Communist Party has consistently adhered to the policy of vigorously developing heavy industry as a necessary condition for the successful development of all sectors of the national economy and has achieved significant successes in this area. Attention was completely focused on the completion of this most important task of the national economy, and large amounts of resources and funds were allocated for this purpose. Our best cadres were engaged in the work of industrializing the state. We did not ensure the possibility of the rapid simultaneous development of heavy industry, agriculture, and light industry. It is necessary to create the necessary conditions for this purpose. Today, we have these necessary conditions. We have a powerful industrial base, increasingly powerful collective farms, and cadres trained in all aspects of economic development.

However, the backwardness of several important sectors of agriculture is due to other reasons, the roots of which lie in the shortcomings in our work, in the shortcomings in the leadership of agriculture, that is, these reasons are due to ourselves.

Among these reasons, first of all, certain sectors of agriculture have violated the principle of material interest. The principle that an enterprise and every worker receives material benefits for labor is one of the basic principles of socialist management. V. I. Lenin pointed out that the transition to communism requires many years, and during this transition period, the economy "should not directly rely on enthusiasm, but should use the enthusiasm generated by the great revolution as an auxiliary, rely on personal interest, rely on the encouragement and commercial principles of individuals..." V. I. Lenin further pointed out that otherwise, "we will not be able to transition to communism; we will never be able to lead these millions of people to communism."

However, it has been proven that certain important sectors of agriculture have not applied this principle of material well-being, this principle of material encouragement for the working people.

This is especially true in livestock farming, where the figures show that in the collective farms of the Central Asian republics, the income from the sale and delivery of cotton to the state is 17 to 36 rubles per labor-day unit, in the Ukrainian Republic, the income from sugar beets is 12 rubles per labor-day unit, and in the USSR as a whole, the income from the sale of industrial crops to the state is approximately 18 rubles per labor-day unit. For example, in highly mechanized regions, such as the North Caucasus, collective farms earn 8 to 14 rubles per labor-day unit from the sale of grain to the state. At the same time, livestock farming earns only 5 rubles per labor-day unit on average in the USSR, and only 4 rubles in Ukraine. Therefore, compared to other sectors of agriculture, livestock farming is in an economically disadvantageous position.

In livestock farming, due to the predominance of manual labor, production costs are high. At the same time, it has been proven that the current prices for the purchase and procurement of livestock products cannot serve as a force to stimulate the development of livestock farming in collective farms and collective farmers, and in the current situation, it cannot provide collective farms and collective farmers with the income they deserve. The situation is the same with vegetables and potatoes.

In addition, many collective farms have violated the most important provisions of the collective farm charter. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the basis of the collective farm economy is the principle of correctly combining the public interest with the personal interests of collective farmers under the condition that personal interests are subordinate to the public interest.

Based on this guiding principle, the collective farm charter stipulates that in a collective farm, there is a main, decisive public economy, and at the same time, each collective farm household has the right to engage in small-scale private farming. Since the public economy of the collective farm has not developed sufficiently and cannot fully meet the public needs of the collective farm and the personal needs of the collective farmers, such auxiliary farming is necessary.

Many collective farms have violated this basic principle of the collective farm. This cannot but lead to, and in fact has already led to, a decrease in the number of cows, sheep, and pigs in the private economy of collective farmers.

The violation of the principle of material interest of collective farms and collective farmers is particularly evident in the current situation. Our industry is developing at a very fast pace. It lacks labor. We have long since eliminated unemployment. The wages of industrial workers are constantly increasing, and their lives are improving year by year. In such a situation, if work in the public economy does not provide the collective farmer with the income he deserves for his labor-day unit, if his personal interests in the auxiliary economy are also harmed, then he can easily find another job—he runs to the city, to the factory to work. This is the reason for the reduction of the private economy of collective farmers and the outflow of the agricultural population from backward collective farms.

One of the important reasons for the serious backwardness of certain sectors of agriculture is the obviously unsatisfactory use of the powerful equipment supplied and to be supplied by the state to machine-tractor stations. In some sectors of agriculture and agricultural work, manual labor still prevails. Although the mechanization level of grain, sugar beet, and cotton cultivation is high, important sectors such as livestock farming, potatoes, vegetables, and flax are lagging behind in mechanization. Many machine-tractor stations have not made good use of tractors and other machinery.

One of the important reasons for the serious backwardness of certain sectors of agriculture is the unsatisfactory leadership of the Party, Soviets, and agricultural organs over collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, especially in the selection, appointment, and training of agricultural personnel and in Party political education work in the countryside.

Finally, it is necessary to talk about the reasons on the part of the collective farms themselves, the chairmen of the collective farms, the management committees of the collective farms, and the collective farmers. In many collective farms, labor discipline is still lax, and not all members of the collective farm fully participate in the production of the collective farm. Not everywhere is the labor of collective farmers well organized. There are still many cases of irresponsibility and neglect of public property.

The goal of further developing socialist agriculture is to improve the well-being of the people. Everyone knows that with the victory of socialism, the consumption of the masses is also constantly increasing. For example, in the past twenty-eight years, the production of consumer goods has increased by approximately twelve times, and the amount of food supplied to the population has increased significantly. However, the well-being, purchasing power, and demand of the Soviet people have developed even faster, and the production of food is far from meeting their ever-growing needs. Therefore, the task of improving the diet of the population is of particular importance.

We must set ourselves the task of making food consumption reach the level of dietary standards based on science, which are necessary for the comprehensive development of a healthy person. In this regard, the main task is to improve the composition of consumer goods, the main method of which is to increase the production of livestock products and vegetables.

To fully meet the needs of the population for dairy products and dairy products, it is necessary to obtain 26 tons of cow's milk from every 100 hectares of usable arable land, pastures, and meadows in our country. And to obtain 26 tons of milk, we need at least 10 cows per 100 hectares of arable land, pastures, and meadows, with an average annual yield of 2,500 to 2,600 kilograms.

To meet the needs of the population for meat and meat products, it is necessary to obtain 2.7 tons of meat from every 100 hectares of arable land, pastures, and meadows. Pig farming must be widely developed, with at least 3 tons of pork produced per 100 hectares of arable land.

We need to have 340 hens per 100 hectares of arable land, with each hen laying at least 110 eggs per year.

It is necessary to significantly increase the production of sugar, melon crops, fruits, berries, and other products.

It is our responsibility to reach such a level of food production as soon as possible. The time required to reach such a level will largely depend on ourselves, on our leadership, and on the organizational work of the Party organizations. If we concentrate our capabilities, resources, and efforts to solve this problem, do not limit our leadership to general instructions, but strive to strengthen every collective farm, every state farm, every machine-tractor station, we will reach such a level of consumption in a short period of time, and for many products, it will take only two to three years.

We have a considerable number of collective farms that have contributed all their efforts to produce abundant grain for our country. In the past two to three years, many of these collective farms have moved from a backward state to the ranks of the advanced. For example, the Molotov collective farm in Ramensky district, Moscow region. Three years ago, several smaller collective farms that were far behind the Molotov collective farm merged with it. Due to the skillful management of the collective farm committee headed by Comrade Puzachikov, the entire collective farm, including the previously backward collective farms that merged with the Molotov collective farm, has made great progress in the past two to three years and has become a highly developed and profitable enterprise. The average annual milk yield per cow has increased from 2,500 kilograms to 4,208 kilograms. The harvest of all crops has increased, with potatoes reaching 16.2 tons per hectare and vegetables reaching 29.4 tons per hectare. The number of livestock has also increased, and this collective farm is obtaining more and more livestock products.

The high productivity of livestock farming and the extremely high yield per unit area of all crops have enabled the Molotov collective farm to earn 3 million rubles in cash income. This collective farm spent 612,000 rubles last year on the construction of livestock houses. Each labor-day unit of the collective farmer earned 25 rubles and 80 kopecks (in cash).

If we compare the standards necessary to meet the needs of the population for livestock products with the actual achievements of the Molotov collective farm, we can see the following situation:

To ensure the consumption of the population according to standards based on science, it is necessary:

- 20 head of beef and dairy cattle per 100 hectares of arable land, pastures, and meadows
- Including 10 head of cows
- 2,700 kilograms of meat (net weight)
- 26 tons of milk
- Average milk yield per cow is 2,500 to 2,600 kilograms

The Molotov collective farm in 1952 had:

- 35 head of beef and dairy cattle per 100 hectares of arable land, pastures, and meadows
- Including 19 head of cows
- 3,100 kilograms of meat (net weight)
- 71 tons of milk
- Average milk yield per cow is 4,208 kilograms

According to all the above indicators, the Molotov collective farm has already surpassed the national standards that we must reach. It should be remembered that the figures of the Molotov collective farm only include public livestock, that is, they do not include livestock owned by collective farmers.

If all our collective farms reach the level of the Molotov collective farm—this work is within the reach of every collective farm—the problem of producing abundant agricultural products will be solved.

Socialist agriculture has all the possibilities to solve the problem of fully supplying the Soviet people with grain and supplying industry with raw materials in the shortest possible time. However, to turn this possibility into reality, it is necessary to strengthen all collective farms organizationally and economically, primarily in each collective farm, to promote capable organizers who can successfully manage large-scale socialist enterprises to leading positions.

It is crucial to give collective farms and collective farmers more material incentives to increase crop yields and develop public livestock farming. For this purpose, the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Party consider it necessary to raise the prices for the procurement and purchase of livestock products, potatoes, and vegetables. For example, the procurement prices for livestock and poultry delivered to the state by compulsory delivery have been increased by more than 5.5 times, dairy products and butter by 2 times, potatoes by 2.5 times, and vegetables by an average of 25 to 40 percent.

As for purchase prices, meat prices have been increased by an average of 30 percent, dairy products by 50 percent. At the same time, it should be noted that the retail prices of livestock products, potatoes, and vegetables have not been increased; on the contrary, they have been reduced every year. The policy of reducing retail prices of consumer goods will continue consistently.

In the current situation, it is appropriate to reduce the compulsory delivery standards for livestock products by collective farmers, the delivery standards for potatoes and vegetables by collective farms. The compulsory delivery standards for livestock products by workers and employees have been significantly reduced.

Due to the reduction in compulsory delivery standards, collective farms and collective farmers will have more surplus products to sell at higher purchase prices and at collective farm market prices. In this regard, it is necessary to amend the current state and cooperative procurement system. It is necessary to transition from the current procurement system to a contract system, which will enable the state to plan in advance the quantity of products received in addition to compulsory delivery and to guarantee collective farms and collective farmers the sale of their products, while also allowing them to advance funds and purchase necessary industrial goods through mutual trade.

To implement urgent measures for the further development of agriculture, the Soviet state will spend an additional 150 billion rubles this year and 350 billion rubles in 1954. A significant part of these expenditures is allocated for new basic investments in agriculture, to provide collective farms and collective farmers with more material incentives to develop livestock farming, produce potatoes and vegetables, so that in the coming years, these sectors of agriculture will achieve significant progress. As a result of the implementation of the above measures, collective farms and collective farmers will receive an additional 130 billion rubles in income in 1953 and more than 200 billion rubles in 1954.

Increasing procurement and purchase prices and reducing compulsory delivery standards are crucial for increasing the material interests of collective farms and collective farmers in the further development of agriculture. However, it is necessary to correctly assess the economic aspects of these measures. At present, their importance and necessity are obvious. However, the main road to the development of collective farm production is not determined by them.

A feature of the economy of a socialist society is the gradual reduction of prices based on the improvement of production, the increase in labor productivity, and the increase in output, with the reduction of the unit cost of production. Overcoming the backwardness of livestock farming, potatoes, and vegetable production, and achieving a continuous strong rise in all sectors of agriculture, the main method is to increase the production level of collective farms, increase total output and commodity output, and reduce the unit cost of production. Then, at the current level of procurement and purchase prices, all sectors of collective farm production will receive huge incomes.

Now there are hundreds and thousands of advanced collective farms that earn huge incomes by delivering and selling meat, dairy products, wool, potatoes, and vegetables to the state at the current procurement and purchase prices. Such collective farms not only fulfill their obligations to the state but also ensure an annual increase in fixed public accumulation funds and generous remuneration per labor-day unit. Therefore, this is not only a matter of increasing procurement and purchase prices but mainly a matter of the level of economic development.

Taking specific collective farms as examples can better illustrate this. The "October 12" and "May 1" collective farms in Kostroma district, Kostroma region, have almost the same soil and climatic conditions, but their work results are very different.

This can be seen from the following figures:

Comparison of economic indicators of the "October 12" and "May 1" collective farms in 1952:

"October 12" collective farm:
- Arable land, pasture, and meadow area: 998 hectares
- Crop yield per hectare (in tons):
  - Grain: 1.85
  - Potatoes: 19.5
  - Vegetables: 16.4
- Milk yield per cow: 5,233 kilograms
- Number of public livestock per 100 hectares of arable land, pasture, and meadow:
  - Beef and dairy cattle: 26
  - Including 10 cows
  - Pigs (per 100 hectares of arable land): 142
  - Poultry (per 100 hectares of arable land): 240
- Livestock products obtained per 100 hectares of arable land, pasture, and meadow:
  - Meat (net weight): 1,300 kilograms
  - Dairy: 50.9 tons
- Cash income of the collective farm: 2,109,000 rubles
- Income per hectare of arable land, pasture, and meadow: 2,113 rubles

"May 1" collective farm:
- Arable land, pasture, and meadow area: 904 hectares
- Crop yield per hectare (in tons):
  - Grain: 0.71
  - Potatoes: 7
  - Vegetables: 8.6
- Milk yield per cow: 1,272 kilograms
- Number of public livestock per 100 hectares of arable land, pasture, and meadow:
  - Beef and dairy cattle: 13
  - Including 6 cows
  - Pigs (per 100 hectares of arable land): 8
  - Poultry (per 100 hectares of arable land): 15
- Livestock products obtained per 100 hectares of arable land, pasture, and meadow:
  - Meat (net weight): 500 kilograms
  - Dairy: 8.5 tons
- Cash income of the collective farm: 151,000 rubles
- Income per hectare of arable land, pasture, and meadow: 167 rubles

The secret of the achievements of the "October 12" collective farm is the appropriate selection and appointment of workers. This collective farm is led by Praskovya Andreevna Malinina, who is very knowledgeable about the business and manages the farm very well. The advantage of Malinina's management is that she and the collective farm management committee she leads rely on the collective farmers and the activists of the collective farm. Here, the role of the collective farm Party organization in leading the enterprise and educating the collective farmers is indeed evident.

Many such examples can be cited. All this proves the enormous potential of collective farms for the further development of agriculture.

I will continue to analyze the situation in the various sectors of agriculture in detail.

(2) The situation in livestock farming and measures for its further development

We are facing the most urgent task in livestock farming because the backwardness of livestock farming is of a long-term nature, and without taking decisive measures, we will not be able to improve the situation quickly.

Our livestock farming was already lagging behind before the war. In the post-war years, a lot of work has been done to restore and further develop livestock farming. From July 1945 to July 1953, the number of beef and dairy cattle in the USSR increased by 11.3 million head, sheep and goats by 53.9 million head, pigs by 25.1 million head.

At first glance, with such an increase in numbers (indeed, these numbers are very large), it seems that there is no need to be alarmed. However, the actual situation is not like this.

Let me cite some figures to illustrate the situation of livestock in the USSR (based on the number of livestock at the beginning of the year, in millions):

These figures show that the number of cows in our country at the beginning of 1953 was 3.5 million head less than at the beginning of 1941 and 8.9 million head less than at the beginning of 1928.

The entire agricultural sector, developing along the path of expanded reproduction, has advanced quite far, while the development of livestock farming has been extremely slow. The productivity of livestock products in collective farms and state farms remains low. The situation in some regions and republics is particularly intolerable. For example, in 1952, the collective farms of Kirov region produced 727 kilograms of milk per cow; Novgorod region 777 kilograms; Voronezh region 819 kilograms; Kostroma region 906 kilograms; Azerbaijan Republic 373 kilograms; Georgian Republic 457 kilograms; Kirghiz 537 kilograms; Armenia 814 kilograms; Byelorussian SSR 829 kilograms.

It is necessary to overcome the backwardness of livestock farming in the shortest possible time, primarily to develop livestock farming in collective farms and state farms, and to take decisive measures to increase the number of livestock and improve the productivity of livestock products.

In the post-war years, livestock farming in collective farms has developed rapidly. By the beginning of 1953, the number of beef and dairy cattle in collective farms had increased by 10.2 million head compared to 1940, including 2.8 million head of cows; the number of sheep and goats had increased by 35.3 million head; the number of pigs had increased by 7.9 million head; the number of poultry had increased by 58 million head.

If we overcome the serious difficulties that stand in the way of the development of public livestock and have delayed the breeding process, then the number of livestock in collective farms will increase even faster. The problem is that the production of feed, the construction of livestock houses, and the mechanization of labor-intensive work in livestock farming have lagged far behind the rate of increase in the number of livestock in collective farms.

Can we overcome these difficulties in the shortest possible time? If we better lead the development of livestock farming, if we select excellent workers for the livestock breeding department and train them well, and if we increase the economic interests of collective farms and collective farmers in the development of public livestock farming, then we will definitely be able to and will overcome these difficulties.

In this regard, I want to discuss in detail the situation regarding the procurement of livestock products. Currently, the procurement work often limits itself to mechanically distributing tasks according to the number of livestock in collective farms, and the principle of delivery per hectare is grossly violated. Those advanced collective farms in regions and districts with developed livestock farming are allocated increasingly more tasks for the delivery of livestock products every year, while those collective farms that do not care about the development of public livestock farming are allocated fewer tasks, and in fact, they are allocated special quotas. This method destroys the economic interests of collective farms and collective farmers in increasing the number of public livestock and improving its productivity.

Here is a typical example. The collective farms in Moscow region are allocated 39.5 liters of cow's milk per hectare of arable land, pasture, and meadow to the state, while the collective farms in Ryazan region are allocated only 14.8 liters. The conditions for the development of livestock farming in Moscow region and Ryazan region are almost the same. However, the collective farms in Lukhovitsy district of Moscow region and Ribnovsky district of Ryazan region deliver 57 liters of cow's milk and 5.5 kilograms of meat per hectare to the state, while the collective farms in Ribnovsky district deliver only 31 liters of cow's milk and 4.7 kilograms of meat. The collective farms in Ukraine deliver much more livestock products per hectare to the state than in other places, for example, in Byelorussian SSR. The collective farms in Ukraine are allocated 6.3 kilograms of meat per hectare, 25 liters of cow's milk, while the collective farms in Byelorussian SSR are 3.9 kilograms of meat, 12.8 liters of cow's milk. However, the conditions for the development of livestock farming in Byelorussian SSR, especially for pig farming, are very good. The Party organizations and Soviet organs of Byelorussian SSR have not really made efforts to increase the number of livestock and improve its productivity. In 1952, the collective farms in Byelorussian SSR had less than one pig per 100 hectares of arable land, and pork accounted for only 13 percent of the total meat delivered, which is not accidental.

What reason is there to set different delivery quotas for collective farms, districts, and regions with roughly the same conditions for livestock farming? The procurement workers try to justify this by saying that it is because the economic development of the collective farms, districts, and regions is unbalanced. They believe that more developed collective farms should deliver more products: since you have kept more young animals this year and obtained more milk, you should be allocated a larger delivery quota. Every time a collective farm develops to a level higher than that of its neighboring collective farms, the procurement workers come to level it, just like a park gardener prunes a bush.

It is necessary to stop this unacceptable practice. It is necessary to strictly adhere to the principle of delivery per hectare as stipulated by the Party and the government, so that in an administrative region, there is generally only one delivery quota per hectare. Only when the nature of the soil is different can there be exceptions with some deviations from the general quota in the locality.

As I said, the interest of collective farms and collective farmers in the development of public livestock is largely determined by the prices for the procurement of livestock products. Due to the increase in procurement and purchase prices, collective farms will be able to earn an additional 38 billion rubles from meat and dairy products this year. The income from the delivery and sale of livestock products to the state will become the main income of collective farms in livestock farming.

Due to the insufficient development of livestock farming, some collective farms often have arrears in the compulsory delivery of livestock products. The corresponding decisions of the Party and the government stipulate the cancellation of the arrears in the delivery of livestock products by collective farms in the past few years to give this sector of agriculture more opportunities for rapid development. It is proposed to take the same steps for collective farmers, workers, and employees who have had arrears in the delivery of livestock products in the past few years, so that they can quickly obtain cows.

Not only in the procurement of livestock products, but also in other issues related to the development of livestock farming, serious mistakes have been made. For many years, the leadership of the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and State Farms, the leadership of many local organizations, have not shown genuine concern for the situation in livestock farming, have allowed unsatisfactory situations to exist, have not raised and solved the problem of developing livestock farming, which we should have done long ago.

Let me use a few examples to illustrate this. In collective farms and state farms, the situation with the number of cows is unsatisfactory. The USSR Ministry of Agriculture and State Farms and many local Soviet organs have tried to increase the total number of beef and dairy cattle, but have paid less attention to increasing the number of cows as much as possible.

In 1953, collective farms could have increased the number of cows by 1.5 million head, but in fact, only 500,000 head were increased. This is because collective farms handed over 1 million head of cows to the state in exchange for pigs and fat bulls, and at the same time, 500,000 head of cows were sold or used within the collective farm. Thus, 1.5 million head of cows were used in one year, accounting for 18 percent of the total number of cows in collective farms. In the livestock departments of the collective farms in Voronezh region, 23 percent of their total number of cows were used in this way last year, in Kazakh SSR 24 percent, in Kirov, Molotov, and Vladimir regions 26 percent.

By the beginning of 1953, the number of cows accounted for 43 percent of the total number of beef and dairy cattle, while in 1941 it was 51 percent. In collective farms, cows accounted for 28 percent of the total number of beef and dairy cattle, and in state farms 31 percent.

To obtain sufficient milk, at least 50 percent of the cattle population must be cows, at least 60 percent in urban suburbs, and at least 40 percent in the collective farms of Kazakhstan, Central Asia, South Caucasus, North Caucasus, the steppes, semi-deserts, and highlands of Altai, Astrakhan, Chkalov, and Chita, and the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the Tuva Autonomous Oblast. However, now in the collective farms of Byelorussian SSR, cows account for only 26 percent of the total number of cattle, in Ukrainian SSR, Kursk, and Voronezh regions only 24 percent, in Rostov region only 21 percent, in Moldavian SSR only 21 percent, how can we talk about a sufficient supply of milk?

In the main dairy product regions, such as Voronezh, Yaroslavl, Tambov, Molotov, Sverdlovsk, Kurgan, Omsk, and Novosibirsk regions, the number of cows has decreased significantly. The insufficient increase in the number of cows explains why the regions that have long been the main suppliers of butter now produce less butter than before. For example, in Siberia, 75,000 tons of butter were produced in 1913, while only 65,000 tons were produced in 1952.

State farms have also progressed slowly in increasing the number of cows. Now they have 1.3 million head of cows, which is 500,000 head less than in 1935. Due to the strange "theory" held by the personnel of the USSR Ministry of State Farms, 200,000 head of cows in state farms are not used for milking but for feeding calves, resulting in the state losing more than 20 million tons of milk annually. The secretary of the Gorno-Altaisk party committee, Comrade Soroka, reported that four years ago, the Aba and Koksin state farms in the Altai Territory stopped milking 2,000 head of Simmental cows. Some of these cows can produce 3,000 kilograms of milk. These state farms delivered 3,500 tons of milk to the state, and now this milk is used to feed calves, and a large amount of milk is wasted and stolen.

The draft resolution stipulates that the number of cows should be increased to 29.2 million head in 1954, which is 4.9 million head more than at the beginning of 1953, including 11.5 million head of cows in collective farms, that is, an increase of 3 million head of cows in the same period.

It is proposed that if the plan for increasing the number of cows is fulfilled, the plan for beef and dairy cattle should be considered fulfilled.

Everyone knows that for many years, the work of planning and calculating the fulfillment of various livestock production plans has started from January 1. The actual situation shows that this procedure is of no use and only harmful. To implement the plan for increasing livestock, the livestock farming of collective farms must have a large number of non-producing, selected, and prepared livestock to be handed over to the state, sold, and used for food by January 1. They must purchase calves from collective farmers, transfer pigs in autumn, and maintain the "rooster" poultry department.

After the investigation on January 1, collective farms immediately reduce a large part of the livestock. For example, in December 1951, all collective farms in the country delivered 232,000 head of beef cattle to the state, and in January 1952, 889,000 head were delivered. In December 1951, the collective farms in Ukrainian SSR delivered 16,700 head of cattle, and in January 1952, 219,000 head were delivered, which is thirteen times the original amount.

According to the estimate of the Central Statistical Administration of the USSR, to fulfill the meat delivery plan for the first quarter of 1952, collective farms delivered 200,000 head of beef cattle more than they should have, because of the lack of feed in winter and poor feeding, which made the livestock very thin.

This has caused great losses to both collective farms and the state.

The economic year in livestock farming actually ends on October 1. By that time, the storage of forage and the preparation of winter construction will be completed, and the livestock will have fattened, which will enable collective farms to deliver heavier livestock as meat after the summer grazing, thus reducing the number of deliveries. By the beginning of October, the work of allocating livestock for different purposes (for breeding, selecting for food, etc.) in collective farms will be completed. Therefore, it is necessary to determine that the economic year in livestock farming begins on October 1.

One of the most serious shortcomings in the development of livestock farming is the excessive number of non-productive females, the high mortality rate of livestock, especially young animals. Last year, in collective farms, compared to 1940, 11 head of calves were born per 100 head of cows, 27 head of lambs per 100 head of ewes, and 163 head of piglets per 100 sows. In the past two years, in the collective farms of Novgorod, Kostroma, and Kurgan regions and the Altai Territory, one out of every three calves died, in 1952, in the collective farms of Voronezh and Ivanovo regions, one out of every two lambs died, in the collective farms of Voronezh, Tambov, and Rostov regions, one out of every five piglets died, in Byelorussian SSR, one out of every four piglets died.

In addition, many more examples can be cited to prove that the leadership of the development of livestock farming is absolutely unsatisfactory.

However, the problem is not in the number of examples. One thing is clear: to get livestock farming out of its current state of neglect, it is necessary to decisively raise the level of leadership in the development of livestock farming in addition to taking many measures.

The draft resolution proposes many measures to significantly increase the number of various productive livestock and improve the productivity of dairy products, wool, and livestock fattening. Due to the planned increase in the number of livestock and the improvement of livestock product productivity, it is planned to increase the total procurement of meat to 410 million tons (300 million tons in 1952), dairy products to 1,430 million tons (1,000 million tons in 1952), eggs to 4.3 billion (2.6 billion in 1952), wool to 2.3 million tons (1.82 million tons in 1952). As I said, livestock products will be procured at higher new prices.

It is necessary to decisively improve the feed situation in collective farms and state farms. In many regions and collective farms, the neglect of feed sources has become absolutely intolerable.

It is necessary to decide on the development of different feed production according to the soil and climatic conditions of the regions.

However, all regions must make every effort to increase the production of succulent feed, and this must become a rule, because if there is no succulent feed, the dairy yield cannot be significantly increased. For example, in the central regions, succulent feed will be potatoes, fodder beets, sugar beets, carrots, pumpkins, and turnips; in the southern regions, fodder watermelons, pumpkins, and beets.

At the same time, more attention should be paid to the cultivation of corn, sunflowers, cabbage, and other feed crops that can be stored.

We should especially emphasize the use of such a valuable feed crop as corn. Many countries with developed livestock farming widely use corn as feed, and this is not accidental. However, in the USSR, even in the most suitable places for corn cultivation, corn is only cultivated on a very small area.

Many regions of the USSR have good conditions for growing corn. We can cite many facts to prove that the collective farms and state farms of Ukraine have a high yield per unit area of corn. As early as 1948, the agronomist Comrade Tarant of the "Communist International" state farm in Poltava region used the square nest method to make a large area of land produce more than 7 tons of corn per hectare. In the "Chkalov" collective farm of Dnepropetrovsk region (chairman is Shevchenko), the average yield per hectare has been 5 tons for five years. I have not mentioned the outstanding achievements of the famous corn cultivation expert, the member of the "Red Partisan" collective farm of Likhovsky district, Dnepropetrovsk region, Mark Ozer, who has increased the yield per unit area of corn every year, reaching an unprecedented figure in 1949—22.4 tons per hectare.

The experience of Moscow region shows that the cultivation of corn ensures a bumper harvest of green fodder in the central regions. The square nest method makes it possible to produce 50 tons or more of green fodder per hectare. For example, the "New Life Path" collective farm and the "Gorky-2" state farm in Moscow region have produced 70 to 80 tons of corn per hectare as green fodder. Most collective farms, even if they do not produce 70 to 80 tons, can produce 25 to 30 tons of fresh corn per hectare, which can obtain 225 to 260 kilograms of butter per hectare of corn.

Some local leaders complain about the lack of feed, while at the same time proposing to reduce the area of corn cultivation. Our comrades in Ukraine have also made this mistake. I ask: can they propose a feed grain with a higher yield?

It is necessary to take decisive measures to increase the production of corn and to significantly expand the area of corn cultivation for feed storage. The cultivation of corn for feed storage should be promoted to the central black soil and non-black soil regions, the Byelorussian and Baltic republics. At the same time, in the southern regions of the Urals and Siberia, the northern regions of the Far East and Kazakhstan, the expansion of corn cultivation for livestock is also very important.

When increasing corn, sunflowers, and other feed crops, we must ensure that every collective farm and state farm builds a storage room that can store 5 to 6 tons of high-quality feed for each cow.

The Party organs, especially in the central black soil and non-black soil regions, must overcome the phenomenon of not paying enough attention to the cultivation of potatoes as feed.

The utilization and improvement of natural pastures and meadows are not satisfactory. In 1952, collective farms stored 960 kilograms of hay per head of beef and dairy cattle, while the figure for 1940 was 1,100 kilograms. It is necessary to significantly increase the yield of natural and artificial grasslands and to develop the cultivation of alfalfa, timothy, and red clover as much as possible. In the southern regions, Sudan grasslands should be given special attention because they produce a large amount of high-quality hay. Wild vetch and oat hybrids grow well in the northern and central regions.

All collective farms should widely implement summer outdoor livestock farming and use the "green moving belt" (the "green moving belt" refers to the cultivation of crops that mature at different times on a piece of land to continuously supply fresh feed) as an effective measure to increase the yield of dairy products.

If the Party, Soviets, agricultural organs, and all agricultural workers do not seriously start to establish a fixed feed base in every collective farm and state farm, livestock farming will not be able to move forward. However, many Party and Soviet workers still consider the production and storage of feed to be a secondary issue. Some comrades do not give specific, daily guidance to the work of producing and storing feed in every collective farm and state farm, but instead, they launch some campaigns and make some speeches full of promises.

For example, the secretary of the Voronezh regional party committee, Comrade Tyomin, understands the task of completing the feed storage as follows: in his report to the plenary session of the regional party committee (this report was later published in the regional newspaper), he said: "We must consider that in livestock farming, the starting point, the basic issue is not the feed base. First is leadership, then the feed base."

He then proposed to complete the haymaking work in a ten to fifteen-day campaign. He said: "Only by launching a comprehensive campaign can this battle be won." He demanded to "establish many collective farm joint headquarters or district headquarters to organize and direct this work."

Let us ask: if such imaginary collective farm joint headquarters are established to direct the haymaking work, then what about the district party committees and district executive committees, what role will they play? The Voronezh regional party committee and the regional executive committee themselves have abandoned the leadership in feed storage. As a result, by August 25, 1952, there were still 159,000 hectares of natural pastures and sown fodder that had not been harvested, and the feed storage plan was only 57 percent completed.

If the feed issue is not solved, the productivity of livestock products cannot be significantly improved.

We can no longer tolerate the situation where the milk yield of many collective farms has not exceeded 1,000 to 1,070 kilograms per cow for more than ten years. This is completely intolerable. Because, like the advanced state farms "Karavaev," "Gorky-2," "Forest Glade," "Kholmogory," and the advanced collective farms "October 12" in Kostroma region, "New Life" in Arkhangelsk region, due to the use of abundant succulent feed, the average milk yield per cow has reached 4,500, 5,000, 6,000 kilograms, and even more in recent years.

Attention must be paid to the issue of improving the productivity of pig farming, and efforts must be made to raise pigs fatter, because the production of pig farming has not yet occupied its due position in the meat supply of our country. In 1952, the total production of pig farming was 160 million tons, while in 1940 it was 150 million tons.

Increasing the wool production of our country is also of great significance. In many regions and districts, the shearing yield of sheep has reached a very high level. In 1952, the collective farms of Stavropol Territory sheared 5.2 kilograms of fine wool per sheep. However, the wool of our country is still not enough. The leading cadres of Kazakh SSR should be severely criticized. The republic now has only 17 million head of sheep and goats, while in 1928 it had more than 19 million head. Although the number of fine-wool sheep has increased to more than four times that of 1940, the average wool yield has decreased from 2.4 kilograms to 1.9 kilograms. Therefore, it is not surprising that Kazakh SSR can only fulfill 60 to 70 percent of the wool supply plan.

Further improving the mechanization level of fodder production in collective farms is of great significance for solving the feed problem. In the past three years, the work of mechanizing fodder harvesting and storage by machine-tractor stations has increased significantly, but the level of total work in fodder production by machine-tractor stations is still very low, far behind the mechanization level already achieved in grain production.

Special attention should be paid to the mechanization of hay harvesting and stacking in a short period. Delaying these works will result in a huge loss of hay. Everyone knows that if hay is not cut down for a long time, or if it is not stacked after being cut down, then its most valuable nutrients will be lost. Therefore, if hay is delayed, the yield of hay per hectare will be greatly reduced.

In 1954-1955, it is planned to increase the mechanization level of hay harvesting and collection to 80 percent; hay stacking to 65 percent; feed storage to 75 percent; row cultivation and inter-row cultivation of root feed crops to 95 percent. It is planned to significantly expand the work of machine-tractor stations to fundamentally improve grasslands and pastures. At the same time, efforts must be made to improve the mechanization level of labor-intensive work in pastures.

Ensuring that all livestock have livestock houses is very important, and it is necessary to increase the sales of building materials to collective farms through the system of the All-Union Consumer Cooperative Association and local cooperatives and local state industries. It is advisable to suggest that collective farms with appropriate conditions produce bricks, tiles, and lime with their own strength and funds to meet their own needs for the above materials. So far, we have discussed the causes of the backwardness of public livestock farming and the path of development. This is our main task. However, we must not forget the livestock owned by the members of collective farms. The situation in this regard is also unsatisfactory. Compared to the pre-war level, the number of cows owned by residents has decreased by 6.5 million head. The number of collective farm households without cows has increased by 45 percent.

The new agricultural tax law recently passed by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has given greater encouragement to collective farm households in livestock farming.

While developing public livestock farming, local Party, Soviet, and agricultural organs must completely eliminate incorrect measures that violate the interests of collective farm households in private livestock farming.

Only those who do not understand the policy of the Party and the policy of the Soviet state would think that collective farm households owning productive livestock within the scope of the collective farm charter would pose a threat to the socialist system. At the same time, it is necessary to eliminate such a prejudice that owning private livestock by industrial workers or office workers is a disgraceful thing.

The measures to allow collective farm households, industrial workers, and office workers to own livestock do not in any way mean to neglect the development of livestock farming in collective farms and state farms.

The development of public livestock farming has been and remains the main method of solving the livestock problem. In the future, when public livestock farming develops to the level of being able to fully meet the demand of collective farmers for livestock products, collective farmers will have no need to raise livestock privately.

However, we have not yet reached this level, and public livestock farming has not yet been able to fully meet the demand of the entire population, including collective farmers, for livestock products. Therefore, collective farm households raising livestock privately do not hinder but help public livestock farming, and are beneficial not only to collective farmers but also to collective farms and the state.

Therefore, to further develop livestock farming, it is necessary to: fundamentally improve the leadership of the development of livestock farming, select and appoint excellent cadres to the livestock breeding department;

- Increase the economic interests of collective farms and collective farmers in the development of public livestock farming;
- Take necessary measures to increase the number of public livestock, especially cows, and improve the productivity of livestock, so as to achieve significant results in 1954;
- Strengthen the feed base of livestock farming and ensure that all livestock have sufficient feed;
- Improve the mechanization level of feed production and pastures, build good livestock houses for all public livestock, and improve the care and management of livestock;
- Help collective farmers to obtain productive livestock.

Comrades! The rapid development of livestock farming is of great importance to the state and is the most urgent task of the Party and the state in agriculture at present. We must complete a major and complex task. However, no matter how great the difficulties, we must complete this work successfully in the next two to three years and quickly increase the production of livestock products.

(3) On increasing the production and delivery of potatoes and vegetables

The next urgent problem to be solved is the problem of increasing the production of potatoes and vegetables. The demand for potatoes and vegetables has increased to such an extent that it must be admitted that their current level of production is far from sufficient. In recent years, the production and total yield of these crops have not only not increased but have even decreased. The area of vegetable cultivation has decreased by 250,000 hectares compared to 1940. The area of potato cultivation has generally increased in the country, but in some regions, it has not reached the pre-war level. In Novgorod region, the area of potato cultivation by collective farms is 38 percent of the pre-war level, in Velikiye Luki region 59 percent, in Smolensk region 61 percent.

However, what is even more surprising is the significant reduction in the yield per unit area in many districts, which has led to a decrease in the total yield of potatoes.

The decrease in the total yield of potatoes and the insufficiency of vegetable production have prevented us from significantly improving the supply of these products to the laborers in cities and industrial centers and the supply of raw materials to food industry enterprises. I have already mentioned that the shortage of potatoes also has a bad effect on the development of livestock farming.

Since there is a great possibility of increasing the yield, but the production of potatoes and vegetables in collective farms has not increased in recent years, and many districts have even reduced it, what is the reason?

One of the reasons for the backwardness of potato and vegetable production is that collective farms and collective farmers do not have a great material interest in the production of these crops. In other crops, such as cotton, sugar beets, tea, and citrus fruits, we have a whole set of material incentive systems to increase production. Until now, we have not had such a system for potatoes and vegetables. Inappropriate procurement prices, incorrect measures taken by procurement agencies to set delivery standards, especially by raising the standards of collective farmers in areas near cities and food industry regions and setting higher standards for advanced collective farms, have destroyed the interests of collective farms in increasing the production of these crops.

It is necessary to correct these shortcomings and provide great material incentives to increase the production of potatoes and vegetables by collective farms. The method of incentive is to increase the procurement prices of potatoes and vegetables, reduce the compulsory delivery standards, purchase more at higher prices, and exempt collective farms with a large proportion of potato and vegetable cultivation from the delivery of grain.

However, it must be pointed out that we have done everything we can in increasing procurement prices. The procurement prices of potatoes and vegetables cannot be increased any further. If we do so in the future, we will incur a loss when selling potatoes and vegetables. In this way, not only will we not be able to reduce the retail prices of potatoes and vegetables according to the consistent policy of the Party and the government, but we will also have to increase the retail prices, which is not in the interests of the people. Needless to say, the Party and the government cannot and will not do this.

Therefore, what we mainly need to do is to strive to increase the yield of these crops, which is still very low. However, the possibility of increasing the yield is very great. The average yield of collective farms is 140 to 150 centners of potatoes per hectare, but several hundred advanced collective farms have already harvested 200 to 300 centners per hectare. The achievements of several thousand advanced agricultural workers are even more outstanding. The female member of the Ukrainian collective farm, Marta Khudoli, harvested 800 centners of potatoes per hectare; the female members of the collective farms in Moscow region, Dianova and Kozhukhanzheva, each harvested more than 500 centners of potatoes per hectare.

If we can increase the yield of potatoes in all collective farms next year, even to the average yield level of collective farms, then this task will be fully realized, and the production of potatoes will be greatly increased. From this, it can be seen that the main source of increased income from potatoes and vegetables is to increase the yield. To achieve this goal, it is first necessary to ensure the full mechanization of the sowing, cultivation, and harvesting of potatoes and vegetables. The main work of sowing and harvesting grain crops has almost been completely mechanized, while last year, the mechanization of potato sowing by collective farms was only 14 percent, and the mechanization of potato harvesting was less than 6 percent.

The problem of mechanizing potato cultivation is mainly the problem of its cultivation method. If we cannot use a more advanced method to fully mechanize inter-row cultivation, we will not be able to solve the problem of mechanization. Is this method already in use in our country? Yes, it has been used, which is the square nest method. Advanced collective farms have long adopted this method. The Stalin collective farm in Serpukhov district, Moscow region, began to use the square nest method to cultivate potatoes as early as 1943. In recent years, many collective farms that have recognized the superiority of this method have also begun to widely adopt it. For example, in this spring, most of the potatoes in Moscow region were cultivated using this method. What are the advantages of the new method? Its advantage is that: it can mechanize inter-row cultivation whether it is horizontal or vertical, and it can greatly reduce manual labor in the care of seedlings. In addition, it can create the best conditions for the development of plants and thus for a bumper harvest.

I will give a few examples: the "Path to Communism" collective farm in Ramensky district, Moscow region, has 920 hectares of arable land. Inter-row crops account for 460 hectares, including 277 hectares of potatoes and 120 hectares of vegetables. There are 321 labor force members in the farm, including 160 engaged in field work. Therefore, one field worker in the collective farm needs to take care of about 3 hectares of inter-row crops. Can a collective farm member manage such a large piece of land with the help of horses and manual labor and still obtain a bumper harvest? Obviously not. In 1951, when the collective farm members began to use the square nest method to sow potatoes, the machines for square nest sowing had not yet appeared. These machines were still being tested. They decided to use cultivators. The judgment of the collective farm members was correct; that is, even if manual work is used and there are no machines, the square nest method should be used to sow. It is better to spend more labor on sowing to create conditions for mechanized operations.

After all operations were mechanized, the yield of the collective farm increased rapidly. In 1952, the yield of potatoes sown with the square nest method was 167 centners per hectare, while the yield of potatoes sown with the ordinary method was only 80 centners per hectare.

This year, almost all the land in the collective farm is sown with potatoes using the square nest method. In the collective farm, the work of sowing four rows of potatoes with the square nest method is done by one person-day, and the cultivator makes three rounds of inter-row cultivation on one hectare of potatoes, which only takes 0.6 person-days. In this way, the sowing and inter-row cultivation of potatoes with the square nest method only takes 1.6 person-days per hectare; if the ordinary sowing method is used, these works would require more than 30 person-days. When using the square nest method, one person-day spent on sowing potatoes can make the collective farm obtain 23 centners of potatoes per hectare, while the ordinary method can only obtain 1.5 centners of potatoes. If the potato sowing machine is well mastered, the labor productivity will be even higher. This requires competent workers. Our people are developing. We already have a considerable number of people who have mastered the technology and are achieving outstanding results. In the "Path to Communism" collective farm in Ramensky district, Moscow region, the machine operator Comrade Akimfyev operated a four-row potato sowing machine and broke the quota of 8 hectares per day, sowing 12.4 hectares per day. If we remember that there are 8 people working on one machine, we can see that each person-day can sow 1.5 hectares of potatoes! The machine operator Comrade Ledkin of the "Voroshilov" collective farm in Bronnitsky district, Moscow region, can sow 10 to 11 hectares of potatoes with a four-row sowing machine in one work shift. These are the advantages of the square nest method! Our task is to widely use this method in production.

It must be pointed out that the responsible personnel of the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and State Reserves have taken an incorrect attitude towards this matter. Their plan requires the use of square nest sowing machines as much as possible in the conditions allowed by sowing machines. However, we now have few machines, and if we follow the plan of the Ministry of Agriculture and State Reserves, only half of the land can be cultivated using the new method. We cannot agree with this. It should be pointed out that the square nest method was initiated in collective farms when we did not have special machines. And it has been applied very effectively in advanced collective farms. Next year, we must universally use the square nest method to sow potatoes. The industry is striving to increase the production of potato sowing machines, but they will still not be enough for use. The sowing of potatoes will have to use cultivators or plows, but the square nest method must be applied. If we do this, and thus mechanize the inter-row cultivation of potatoes, we can be sure that the yield of potatoes will be significantly increased next year.

Everyone knows that when using cultivators and plows to implement the square nest method, the work of planting potatoes is done by hand. In this way, manure and tubers can be planted together in the hole, which is very important for increasing the yield per unit area. In the same "Path to Communism" collective farm (Ramensky district), when planting with a cultivator on sandy soil, half a kilogram of manure and mineral fertilizer mixture was placed in each hole. At harvest time, 15.6 tons of potatoes were harvested per hectare. The method of placing fertilizer in the hole can make the fertilizer used more effectively. Originally, to obtain such a yield, about 30 to 40 tons of manure were needed per hectare of soil, but by placing the fertilizer in the hole, only 10 tons were needed. Any collective farm or state farm can use the square nest method to plant potatoes with a cultivator or plow, and at the same time, place manure and mineral fertilizer in the hole. Everything depends on the leadership, the understanding of the importance of the new method, and the perseverance and skill in organizing this work, that is, the correct allocation of manpower, the designation of land for planting crops, and the arrangement of other work.

Regarding the seeds, it must also be mentioned. As the saying goes: "Do not expect good seeds from bad seeds." Unfortunately, we have neglected the potatoes used for seeds, and this neglect has sometimes reached a criminal degree. Many collective farms and state farms use poor-quality seeds and do not meet the standards. However, the use of standard potatoes is a particularly important and often decisive condition for obtaining a bumper harvest. For example, the advanced collective farms in Moscow region sow 2 to 3 tons per hectare. After good cultivation, they harvested 20 to 25 tons of potatoes per hectare. Unfortunately, most collective farms, with the tacit approval of their leaders, sow only 1 ton or 1.5 tons of potatoes per hectare. Of course, with such a standard and the use of poor-quality and small seeds, especially careless inter-row cultivation, there is no hope for a bumper harvest of potatoes.

We cannot allow this situation to continue. Allowing cultivation under such a standard is deliberately causing the collective farm to have a poor harvest, and such workers must be severely punished. Each collective farm must have its own seed potatoes, and they must be stored in September, no later than September, and they must be selected from a bumper crop. At that time, the potatoes are dry and will be well preserved. The work of storing seed potatoes is delayed until the last few days of harvest, and the harvest is delayed until the end of October, sometimes until November. The wet season has arrived, early frost has fallen, and the collective farm has not yet stored its seeds. Therefore, the potatoes are often damaged by frost and are not completely dry when stored.

In the spring, when the pits are opened, half of the potatoes are already rotten. If each collective farm and state farm stores its seed potatoes in September and we must do this resolutely, then we will have enough seed potatoes. The area of early-maturing potato varieties must be greatly expanded, and in the southern regions, more attention should be paid to the summer cultivation of potatoes using the method of Academician Lysenko.

Comrades! Potatoes are of great importance to the national economy. Potatoes can not only be used as food but also as raw materials for the production of alcohol, starch, etc. If the same area is used to grow potatoes and grain, the alcohol obtained from potatoes will be four times that obtained from grain. Potatoes are a good feed for livestock, mainly pigs, dairy cows, and poultry.

The materials of Academician D. N. Pryanishnikov prove that the production of one pood of pork requires about 10 poods of potatoes. If 15 poods of potatoes are grown per hectare and then a small part of the grain is used to feed pigs, it will be possible to increase the pork by 90 poods. If dairy cows are properly fed with potatoes, the result will definitely be the production of more milk and butter.

The task of increasing potato production has become one of the main tasks for further developing agriculture. If we have enough potatoes, we will be able to significantly increase the production of pork, milk, and butter in the next two years. The role of the Central Non-Black Soil Region in the production of potatoes and vegetables should be specially mentioned. I remember that the conditions in Moscow, Leningrad, Ryazan, Tula, and other regions, as well as in Byelorussian, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian republics, are very suitable for the large-scale cultivation of potatoes. Unfortunately, these regions produce very few potatoes and vegetables.

Until now, the plans for vegetable cultivation by agricultural organs have been incorrect. If a district is assigned 100 hectares of land to grow white cabbage, then it will definitely allocate this quota evenly to all the collective farms in the district. The situation is the same for the cultivation of cucumbers, tomatoes, and other vegetables. From an economic point of view, this principle is completely wrong. The cultivation of vegetables requires special conditions and special soil. Most vegetables, especially white cabbage, can have a much larger yield in wet lowlands. However, our method is to allocate the same quota to collective farms with waterfront land and collective farms without such soil conditions. Collective farms have to cultivate white cabbage and other vegetables on unsuitable land. Although these collective farms have spent a lot of labor and money on this, the harvest is still very small.

So, what should be done about the allocation of vegetable cultivation? The best solution to this problem should be to concentrate the cultivation of vegetables in areas with soil most suitable for vegetable cultivation. This is the path taken by the Party and Soviet organizations in Moscow region, which have submitted a draft resolution on "Concentration of crops and mechanization of vegetable cultivation in collective farms" for the government's consideration. The proposal of Moscow region has been considered and approved by the government. Now, the vegetable cultivation in the collective farms of the region, mainly the cultivation of white cabbage, will be concentrated on the most suitable land for this purpose—the waterfront land.

Previously, in Moscow region, there were 1,373 collective farms cultivating vegetables, and today, the supply of vegetables to the market will mainly be concentrated in 252 collective farms, of which 141 are located in the waterfront area. The area of vegetable cultivation in the waterfront areas of the Moskva River, Oka River, Yakhroma River, and Klyazma River will increase from 6,000 hectares in 1952 to 12,000 hectares in 1954. Due to the concentrated cultivation of vegetables, the yield will increase, and Moscow region should actually fully meet the needs of Moscow city and other cities in the region for white cabbage, carrots, and sugar beets, and to a considerable extent, meet the needs for tomatoes and cucumbers.

To solve the problem of concentrated vegetable cultivation in other regions, districts, and republics, it is necessary to follow the example of the people of Moscow.

The mechanization of inter-row cultivation is of particular importance for increasing the yield of vegetables. It is abnormal that until now, the cultivation of vegetables in most collective farms is basically done by hand. Why not use the square nest method for some vegetables? When asked this question by the department heads, they replied that there are no square nest machines. But this reason is untenable! Because white cabbage and tomatoes are still planted by hand as usual, so changing to the square nest method for planting will not require more labor. Even if this planting method requires a little more labor, the collective farm will still be compensated in the subsequent work. Using the square nest method for planting, we can mechanize inter-row cultivation with a tractor, and if there is no tractor-drawn tool, we can use a horse-drawn cultivator. Timely cultivation is beneficial to the harvest. Therefore, in the spring of 1954, white cabbage, tomatoes, and eggplants should be planted using the square nest method. Cucumbers, pumpkins, squash, and watermelons should also be planted using the square nest method.

One of the important methods to increase the yield of vegetables is to use the method of cultivating seedlings in peat humus containers. This valuable suggestion was made by Professor Edelshtain more than twenty years ago. Unfortunately, the agricultural organs have hardly made efforts to promote the method of cultivating seedlings in peat humus containers. In the places where this method has been adopted, surprising results have been achieved. The "In Memory of Ilyich" collective farm in Miginsky district, Moscow region, has achieved an average early-maturing white cabbage yield of 447 centners per hectare in thirteen years since the adoption of the method of cultivating seedlings in peat humus containers. The collective farmers, by adopting the method of cultivating seedlings in peat humus containers, have increased the yield of white cabbage by 100 centners per hectare. There is a Gorky state farm near Moscow, where agronomist Feratov works. He is a very enthusiastic person about his work. After adopting the method of cultivating seedlings in peat humus containers, he achieved a bumper harvest of early-maturing vegetables. In 1953, the state farm began to harvest early-maturing white cabbage and deliver it to the state starting from June 25, and cauliflower starting from June 11. The average yield of early-maturing white cabbage was 298 centners per hectare, and cauliflower was 241 centners per hectare. The income from early-maturing white cabbage was 65,000 rubles per hectare, and from cauliflower was 82,000 rubles per hectare. The state farm delivered early-maturing vegetables worth 7,334,000 rubles to the state by August 1, 1952, and early-maturing vegetables worth 11,115,400 rubles in the same period in 1953. This is the effect of this new method of increasing the yield of vegetables. The problem now is to organize every vegetable-producing state farm and collective farm to cultivate seedlings in peat humus containers.

Now, very few collective farms and state farms cultivate valuable vegetables such as eggplants, peppers, pumpkins, tomatoes, and green beans. This limits the canned food production of the food industry. The current task is to expand the cultivation of these vegetables and increase their yield in the next one to two years. In regions suitable for growing watermelons and muskmelons, more watermelons and muskmelons should be grown.

Finally, there is the issue of greenhouses and hotbeds. Without establishing good hotbeds and greenhouses, our vegetable industry cannot be improved. According to rough estimates, collective farms need about 14 million hotbed frames for seedling cultivation, but all collective farms have only about 5 million hotbed frames this year. The work of supplying hotbed frames to various collective farms has not been organized yet. The price of hotbed frames currently on sale is too high. The problem of hotbed development should be solved immediately.

Wherever possible, efforts should be made to utilize the waste heat from industrial enterprises. Vegetable-growing collective farms often do not have enough biological fermentation heat energy to heat hotbeds and soil, nor do they have enough coal and firewood to heat greenhouses. However, the waste heat from industry (steam, hot water), which is almost free, is utilized very little. The actual situation of some collective farms shows that these fuel sources can be effectively used to heat greenhouses and hotbeds.

The "Third Five-Year Plan" collective farm in Ukhtoma district, Moscow region, is using industrial waste heat. In 1952, the members of the collective farm built a greenhouse with an area of 1,080 square meters, using the waste steam from a factory near the collective farm to heat the greenhouse. Unfortunately, such examples are too few. The industrial waste heat from Donbass, Leningrad, Gorky, Sverdlovsk, and other cities has not been utilized, although there is a great possibility in this regard.

It is necessary to suggest that collective farms and state farms widely use steam and electricity to heat hotbeds, which can reduce the labor of collective farmers and increase the yield of vegetables. For example, the "In Memory of Ilyich" collective farm in Moskovoretsky district began to use steam to heat hotbeds in 1952. This year, the collective farm has 1,200 steam-heated hotbed frames. As of August 1, 1953, the average yield per hotbed in the collective farm was: 28 kilograms of vegetables for steam-heated hotbeds; 19 kilograms of vegetables for hotbeds heated by biological fermentation. Calculated by the labor days spent on cultivating vegetables in hotbeds, the yield per labor day was: 26 kilograms of vegetables for steam-heated hotbeds; 15 kilograms of vegetables for hotbeds heated by biological fermentation. The collective farm harvested 485 centners of white cabbage per hectare in 1953, 260 centners of tomatoes. The cash income from vegetables per hectare of vegetable land in the collective farm reached 56,000 rubles. The remuneration per labor day of the collective farm in 1952 was only 22 rubles and 76 kopecks in cash.

From this, it can be seen that to increase the production of potatoes and vegetables, it is necessary to: increase the material interests of collective farms and collective farmers in the cultivation of these crops; mechanize the planting, inter-row cultivation of potatoes and vegetables, and widely adopt the square nest method; adjust the vegetable cultivation areas, concentrate the cultivation of vegetables in riverbank areas, lowlands, and lowlands; increase the accumulation of manure and other local fertilizers as much as possible, increase peat fertilizer, so that potatoes and vegetables are planted in land with sufficient fertilizer; increase hotbeds and greenhouses, and use peat humus containers to cultivate seedlings.

The task of increasing the production of potatoes and vegetables is arduous. It is necessary to make these crops' production be able to fully meet the needs of the residents of our country in the shortest possible time. This task is within our capability. This task should be solved and can be solved.

(4) On increasing the yield per unit area of grain and industrial crops

To overcome the backwardness of livestock farming and the production of potatoes and vegetables, we must ensure that the production of grain is increased even more rapidly in the future. This is not only to meet the ever-growing demand for food by the population but also to rapidly increase all sectors of agriculture, primarily livestock farming.

The achievements of grain production are much greater than those of some other sectors of agriculture. We have not only restored grain production, which suffered from war injuries, in a relatively short period but have also expanded it. The sowing area of such valuable grain as wheat has been rapidly expanding. Now the sowing area of wheat is 8.1 million hectares larger than before the war. Ukraine, North Caucasus, and Crimea have made great achievements in the development of grain production. The sowing area of wheat in these places has been restored and even expanded, and the sowing area of winter wheat has increased particularly significantly, and its yield per unit area has increased.

Many collective farms and entire districts have a yield of 150 to 200 poods of wheat per hectare. The Stalin collective farm in Volna district, Chuvash Autonomous Region, has a yield of 212 poods of spring wheat per hectare. The collective farms in Bashkir district, Nikolaev region, had a yield of 170 poods per hectare for all winter wheat sowing in 1952.

This is a great achievement. However, a considerable part of collective farms and state farms still have a low yield per unit area of grain, especially leguminous crops. In this regard, the backward regions include the non-black soil regions, the central black soil regions, the Volga region, western Siberia, and the districts of Kazakhstan.

Collective farms and state farms have a great potential to increase the production of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and other grains year by year.

Special attention must be paid to wheat. To increase the production of winter wheat and spring wheat, in addition to the original regions where these crops are sown, there are broad possibilities in the central black soil regions, the Volga region, many regions of the Ukrainian forest-steppe, and some regions of the non-black soil regions. As long as all necessary agronomic and technical conditions are followed, the winter wheat and spring wheat in these regions can have a very high yield per unit area.

It is necessary to resolutely overcome the phenomenon of backwardness in the production of grain forage crops, whose yield per unit area is still very low.

Our sowing area of grain forage crops is not enough, and the yield per unit area is very low. Therefore, the storage of buckwheat and millet has been greatly reduced. The importance of buckwheat is known to everyone. However, what attitude is taken towards the cultivation of this crop? As usual, it is not sown in time, it is sown in bad land, the land is not plowed well, auxiliary pollination is not carried out, bees are not raised, etc. No serious efforts have been made to increase the yield of millet, and the wide-row sowing method has hardly been adopted, and even in the places where it has been adopted, inter-row cultivation is not carried out regularly. Millet and other crops sown with the wide-row method will not have a high yield per unit area if inter-row cultivation is not carried out. At the same time, it must be pointed out that we have not encouraged the production of grain forage crops enough. During procurement, 40 pounds of millet is equivalent to 34 pounds of wheat or 40 pounds of rye, which cannot increase the interest of collective farmers in sowing millet. It is necessary to determine the correct exchange price of these crops. We have the possibility to increase the production of rice in the southern regions, South Caucasus, Central Asia, South Kazakhstan, and the Far East.

Another serious shortcoming is that many collective farms have not actually adopted the bonus system, a powerful incentive method, for the sowing of grain. The yield standards for obtaining bonuses are set too high, so many collective farm members do not receive this bonus. It is now necessary to modify the method of issuing bonuses.

We must not forget about millet. It is necessary to continue efforts for this grain. Select varieties with a very high yield per unit area and test them in experimental stations and collective farms and state farms. To ensure that the entire population obtains a variety of food, it is necessary to make every effort to increase the production of leguminous crops—peas, beans, broad beans, and soybeans.

After the war, the sowing area of oilseed plants in collective farms has increased significantly and has already exceeded the pre-war level. There is a great possibility to significantly increase the yield of sunflowers. Unfortunately, its yield is very low. There are many collective farms and entire districts that take good care of sunflowers and have a high yield per unit area. For example, Mariye district in Stalin region is like this, where the collective farms can harvest more than 18 centners of sunflower seeds per hectare.

If we change to the square nest method to sow this crop, we can mechanize the cultivation, carry out high-quality and timely cultivation, and greatly increase the yield per unit area of sunflowers. In this way, we can meet the national demand for vegetable oil.

In addition to sunflowers, it is necessary to make every effort to increase the production of oilseed flax, castor beans, peanuts, mustard, flax, and other oilseed crops.

We have achieved great success in the development of cotton farming. This year, the area of cotton sown in irrigated land exceeded the area of 1940 by 317,000 hectares. In 1952, the yield of raw cotton per hectare in various irrigation areas exceeded the pre-war yield by 6 centners. The cotton produced last year was 70 percent more than in 1940. There are hundreds of collective farms with an average yield of 30 to 40 centners of raw cotton per hectare, and many work teams and brigades have a yield of 50 centners and more than 50 centners of raw cotton per hectare.

Title: Further Expand the Production of the Most Valuable Crop

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th

In the future, it will be necessary to further expand the production of this most valuable crop. The republics that grow cotton still have a great deal of untapped potential. If we consider that last year, one-third of the cotton-growing collective farms produced less than fifteen centners of raw cotton per hectare, it is clear that the yield of these collective farms can be increased to at least twenty to twenty-five centners per hectare. This task is primarily before the cotton-growing collective farms of Kazakhstan, which until now have had very low yields of cotton per unit area: an average of eleven to twelve centners per hectare. In the Kirghiz Republic, the Turkmen Republic's Tashauz Province, and the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Republic, cotton production has increased very slowly. The Khorezm and Samarkand provinces of the Uzbek Republic have a great potential for increasing cotton production that has not yet been realized.

The restoration and development of unused irrigation lands have not been done well, which hinders the further development of cotton cultivation. The work of improving the soil has not been satisfactory. It is necessary to ensure a significant increase in cotton production in the shortest possible time and to fully meet the needs of the light industry for this valuable raw material.

The production of sugar beets has achieved significant results. The area sown with sugar beets in 1953 was 28 percent higher than in 1940, and the yield per unit area has also increased. Domestic sugar production surpassed the pre-war level as early as 1950 and has been increasing steadily since then. However, the demand of the population for sugar still exceeds its production.

Our task is to increase sugar beet production by 65 to 70 percent by the end of the five-year plan, increasing the total annual harvest from 220 million centners in 1952 to about 350 million centners. The methods are: expanding the sowing area in the main sugar beet growing regions, transplanting sugar beets to new areas, and primarily increasing the yield per unit area and the total harvest.

The comparative materials from Kursk and Kharkov states eloquently demonstrate that, on the one hand, we have such great potential for increasing sugar beet yields, while on the other hand, due to poor agricultural technology, collective farms and the state have suffered huge losses. These two states are neighbors and are developing agriculture under the same conditions. However, their results are so different.

The number of centners of sugar beets delivered to the state per hectare by each is:

1940	1950	1951	1952
Kursk State	92	94	139	96
Kharkov State	183	190	213	185

In 1952, the collective farms of Kursk State cultivated 131,000 hectares of sugar beets, while the collective farms of Kharkov State cultivated only 62,000 hectares. Yet, the amount of sugar beets delivered to the sugar factories by these two states is almost equal: Kursk State is 12.6 million centners, while Kharkov State is 11.5 million centners. The reason for this phenomenon is mainly due to the different levels of agricultural technology.

The following is the data on the time spent on the main field work in 1952:

Kursk State	Kharkov State
Sowing	20 days	10 days
Loosening	45 days	30 days
Idle period	55 days	30 days
Harvesting	70 days	55 days

Kharkov State takes much better care of the sugar beet crop than Kursk State. These data show that the leadership of agriculture in Kursk State is unsatisfactory.

Such crops as long-fiber flax and hemp also need attention. In recent years, we have created favorable conditions for the development of these crops. Many collective farms that have completed and overfulfilled the delivery plans for flax and hemp have earned high incomes from these crops, earning 10,000 rubles or more per hectare of flax and hemp cultivation. Despite the fact that the government has provided significant assistance to the machine-tractor stations and collective farms in the regions where flax and hemp are grown, the production of these crops is still in an extremely unsatisfactory state. In many states, territories, and republics, there is a lack of interest in increasing the production of long-fiber flax and hemp. The area sown with these crops has not only not been restored to the pre-war level, but has also decreased significantly compared to 1950 over the past three years. The yield per unit area and the commercial yield of these crops are still very low. Little attention is paid to ensuring that collective farms have their own long-fiber flax seeds.

The situation is particularly bad in the restoration and development of flax production in the Smolensk, Ivanovo, Kostroma, Kirov, Velikiye Luki, Bryansk, and Dyatkovo states, as well as in the Altai and Krasnoyarsk territories; in the development of hemp production in the Bashkir and Moldavian Autonomous Republics, Oryol, Tambov, and Gorky states, and the Belarusian SSR.

The main reason hindering the development of flax and hemp production is the backward state of mechanization of their cultivation, harvesting, and especially the primary plowing. Each collective farm has to spend a lot of labor on spreading flax, soaking flax, and cleaning up flax from the ground. Due to the lack of labor and the backwardness of mechanization, collective farms cannot timely carry out these works and cause significant losses to flax. Agricultural authorities must seriously start the work of mechanizing all flax production operations. The experience of flax processing in Novosibirsk State is worth noting. Last year, ten collective farms in the Maslyanino and Polotnoye districts of this state experimented with directly sending flax from the field to the flax factory. The threshing and processing of flax were carried out by the factory. As a result, the fiber commercial production of these collective farms increased by three to three and a half times, and the flax seeds increased by two to four times.

The USSR Ministry of Agriculture and the USSR Ministry of Light Industry must study this experience and pay attention to its widespread application. The work should be organized in such a way that collective farms deliver unthreshed flax to flax factories, and flax factories organize the pulling of flax, the removal of seeds, the soaking of flax, and the processing of flax stalks. Hemp factories must be prepared to accept hemp stalks. Mechanized workshops for flax and hemp dry stalks should be built in each flax and hemp factory, and mechanized flax threshing workshops should also be built.

It is also important to expand the production of tobacco, low-grade tobacco, tea, fruits, grapes, citrus fruits, and other crops in collective farms and state farms.

Increasing the yield per unit area is a major task in agriculture. To this end, some important and urgent measures must be taken.

The efficiency of cultivation must be thoroughly improved. In many collective farms and state farms, the adoption of crop rotation, especially the organization of crop rotation, is poor. The main reason for this phenomenon is the neglect of the work of cultivating forage seed. The work of cultivating perennial forage seeds in collective farms and state farms must be decisively improved, and their yield per unit area must be increased. The task of sowing forage crops must not only be completed in the next two to three years but must also establish the necessary reserves. Measures must be taken to ensure that each collective farm and state farm is self-sufficient in perennial and annual forage seeds. At the same time, we must consider the organization of commercial seed cultivation, primarily in regions where very high yields of forage seeds can be obtained.

We must plant more forage legumes. In the northern regions, forage legumes sown for seed cultivation often do not mature. Therefore, a large number of collective farms in the northern regions have not been self-sufficient in forage legume seeds. It is necessary to decide in which regions the commercial production of forage legume seeds should be organized.

An important factor in increasing the yield per unit area is the timely plowing of fallow land and autumn plowing, and sowing crops at the most appropriate time. In some regions, the low yield per unit area of winter crops is due to the fact that these winter crops are sown very late and are sown on fallow land that has not been properly plowed in a timely manner and is insufficiently fertilized, or are sown on newly plowed land that was not fallowed the previous year. In the non-black soil region, many collective farms delay the sowing of winter crops until the second half of September, and some collective farms even delay the sowing until October. It is clear that not following agricultural technology methods will result in significant losses to winter crops.

In many regions, one of the reasons for the low yield per unit area of spring crops is that until now, spring crops have been sown very late and are sown on soil that has been plowed in the spring and is not well cultivated. In 1951, 38 percent of the spring crops were sown on land that was plowed in the spring; in 1952, 33 percent; in 1953, 41 percent; and in 1953, in states such as Smolensk, Pskov, Novgorod, Velikiye Luki, Voronezh, and Kostroma, 80 to 90 percent of the spring crops were sown on land that was plowed in the spring. It is natural that it is difficult to obtain a high yield per unit area by sowing crops in this way. Such a situation must no longer be allowed to continue. This autumn, all the land to be sown next spring must be plowed.

The seed issue must also be given serious attention. Many collective farms and state farms do not pay enough attention to their own seeds and borrow large amounts of grain seeds from the state every year. A lot of time, labor, money, and transportation are wasted on the transportation of grain seeds. This spring, collective farms in the central states alone borrowed more than 500,000 tons of grain seeds, accounting for about 30 percent of the seeds they needed. About 30 million rubles of state funds (not including the expenses of collective farms) have been spent on the transportation and cleaning of this batch of seeds. There is another point worth noting. The borrowed seeds are often not suitable for the soil and climatic conditions of the sowing area. Under such circumstances, it is natural that one cannot expect a high yield per unit area.

Now is the time to rectify the work of cultivating seeds. In 1954-1955, it is necessary to transition to sowing high-quality seeds for all crops. This year, the government has established a new system for the reserve of seeds in collective farms and state farms. The work of reserving seeds must be done at the most appropriate time, storing the best selected seeds, primarily reserving seeds from the harvest of seed plots that have been cultivated according to agricultural technology standards. If the seed plots do not have enough good seeds before the plan for delivering grain to the state is completed, it is necessary to store the best grain from the general crop plots with the highest yield per unit area. At present, all conditions have been created for collective farms and state farms to fully prepare the best seeds of varieties with high yield per unit area. The brutal method of reducing the sowing standard per hectare must be decisively corrected.

In recent years, the incorrect attitude of agricultural authorities, collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms towards the use of local fertilizers must be criticized and considered a serious shortcoming. The significance of this issue is underestimated, which is harmful. Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain why the plans for the accumulation of manure and the mining of peat have not been completed.

Everyone knows that manure is a very valuable fertilizer. By the end of this five-year plan, we will have about 400 million tons of manure annually, which is roughly equivalent to 20 million tons of mineral fertilizers, or about 3.5 times the amount of fertilizers currently produced by industry. The collection, proper storage, and use of manure must be given close attention. The phenomenon of improperly storing manure must be eliminated because improper storage of manure will cause it to be affected by the climate, resulting in the loss of a lot of valuable property. Each collective farm and state farm's livestock breeding department must build manure storage rooms. Manure must be transported to the fields in a timely manner and plowed into the soil. Measures must also be taken to mechanize the labor-intensive work of loading and spreading manure, organizing the production of manure spreaders and loaders, and using these machines in the fields of collective farms and state farms.

In white, grayish, acidic soil areas, the application of lime, and in alkaline soil areas, the application of gypsum, is of great significance for increasing the yield per unit area. Therefore, it is necessary to significantly increase the production of lime in building materials enterprises, local industrial enterprises, and production cooperatives, and to organize the mining and crushing of gypsum and its transportation to collective farms.

While using local fertilizers to increase the yield per unit area, it is necessary to significantly expand the production of mineral fertilizers. The government plans to increase the production of mineral fertilizers. This year, collective farms and state farms will receive 600,000 tons of mineral fertilizers from industry, which is almost double the amount received by agriculture in 1940. In the following years, the production of fertilizers will increase significantly. The work of storing mineral fertilizers will be rectified and mineral fertilizers will be used well. It is also necessary to use bacterial fertilizers on a large scale.

The implementation of the above measures will improve the efficiency of cultivation and significantly increase the yield per unit area of all crops.

(5) Improving the Work of Machine-Tractor Stations

Machine-tractor stations play a major and decisive role in the further development of agriculture. Machine-tractor stations now have 969,000 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower each), an increase of 74 percent over the pre-war period; 255,000 grain combine harvesters, an increase of 66 percent over 1940; and many other machines.

In the post-war years, machine-tractor stations have received many new machines. Before the war, tractors were mostly wheel-type; after the war, many diesel-engine crawler tractors were supplied. Their number has increased to 14 times that of 1940. New types of cultivation tractors have been created—Belarus, KDP-35, and KhTZ-7; the production of trailed machines and tools has been organized. The production of cotton pickers, sugar beet combines, and other machines is increasing day by day.

Every year, the mechanization of production in collective farms is increasing, the use of manual labor is decreasing, and the labor productivity of collective farmers is continuously improving. This shows that the further development of all sectors of agriculture primarily depends on the improvement of the work of machine-tractor stations.

Unfortunately, many party, Soviet, and agricultural authorities do not understand that mechanization is an indispensable condition for maintaining the rate of development and the huge scale of production. Many party, Soviet, and agricultural authorities do a poor job of guiding machine-tractor stations, do not provide proper supervision to ensure that agricultural work is completed in a timely and good manner, and do not properly select and train personnel for machine-tractor stations. The main shortcomings in the work of machine-tractor stations are that the use of equipment is completely unsatisfactory. This is the main reason why many very important sectors of agriculture are lagging behind.

It is necessary to fundamentally change the attitude towards machine-tractor stations, to resolutely eliminate the serious shortcomings in their work, and to implement the full mechanization of agricultural work.

The main task of machine-tractor stations is to strive to increase the yield per unit area of all crops in collective farms, to ensure an increase in the number of public livestock, and at the same time to improve the productivity of their products, and to increase the total and commercial production of agricultural and livestock products in the collective farms they serve. Machine-tractor stations must mechanize the work of sowing grain and technical crops, mechanize labor-intensive work in livestock breeding, as well as in the production of potatoes and vegetables, apply scientific achievements and the most advanced experience to collective farm production, and ensure the further organizational and economic consolidation of collective farms on this basis, thereby improving the material well-being of collective farmers.

Machine-tractor stations must ensure that all the areas they cultivate achieve a high yield per unit area. If tractors and other machines are used effectively, agricultural work is done well, and all work is completed in the shortest possible time, this goal can be achieved. However, many machine-tractor stations have not performed this very important task. They do not follow the established agricultural technology methods, delay the work period, plow the soil poorly, and sow crops poorly, which will inevitably reduce the harvest. Last year, more than half of the machine-tractor stations did not complete their plans. In the work of sowing spring and winter crops, more than 20 percent of the work was not completed on time. Important work such as the mid-season cultivation of fallow land, autumn plowing, mowing, and feed storage was also done poorly. There were significant losses in the harvesting work. This is because a considerable number of tractors and other machines did not work in the fields. In 1952, only 34 percent of the tractor drivers completed their production quotas per shift. In the machine-tractor stations of Novosibirsk State, Kalinin State, Smolensk State, Yaroslavl State, Velikiye Luki State, Pskov State, Novgorod State, and the Belarusian SSR, the organization of tractor use was particularly poor.

One of the main reasons for this situation is that machine-tractor stations do not have skilled machine operators. The complex equipment of machine-tractor stations requires skilled workers. However, this equipment is operated by seasonal workers assigned by collective farms to do temporary field work. Tractor drivers are actually not under the jurisdiction of the machine-tractor station director. If he wants to work, he works; if he does not want to work, the director has difficulty doing anything about it. Today he operates a tractor, and tomorrow he might return to the collective farm or go to work in industry. This, to a considerable extent, explains why labor discipline is lax and personnel turnover is high. Every year, 30 to 35 percent of tractor drivers leave the tractor brigade, and in many tractor brigades, tractor drivers and machine operators change several times a year. If we want to fundamentally improve the work of machine-tractor stations, we must make skilled machine operators fixed personnel who can make the most of the equipment and ensure the further development of all sectors of collective farms.

Therefore, it is necessary to make tractor drivers, tractor brigade leaders and their assistants, excavator operators and their assistants, record-keeping fuel workers fixed personnel of machine-tractor stations and include them in the staffing of machine-tractor stations. They should learn various trades during the agricultural off-season, be employed in repair shops, engage in the mechanization of livestock breeding in collective farms, and do other work in machine-tractor stations. Tractor-drawn agricultural machine operators and excavator operators, as well as combine harvester assistants, should be included in the staffing of machine-tractor stations as seasonal workers.

It is necessary to improve the material interests of tractor brigade workers to make them use machines more effectively and increase the yield per unit area.

The wage system that determines the remuneration of tractor brigade workers by labor days and piecework has proven its advantages in practice; according to this system, workers receive wages according to the production quotas they complete, and material remuneration according to the yield per unit area of crops. This system will continue in the future.

It is planned to increase the cash remuneration that tractor brigade workers receive from machine-tractor stations in labor days. In addition, as usual, they will receive remuneration in labor days the same as collective farmers; the method of giving them additional wages for overfulfilling the plan for the yield per unit area of crops will also be retained. The method of paying wages to tractor drivers and other workers in the tractor brigade, that is, paying grain wages according to the guaranteed minimum wage, will be changed. Previously, they received grain from collective farms, and now they will receive it from machine-tractor stations. In the future, the grain that tractor brigade workers should receive according to the guaranteed minimum wage (remuneration in labor days) and the grain they should receive for harvesting crops using combines and other machines will be handed over to the state procurement stations by collective farms together with the material wages paid to the state. Machine-tractor stations will receive the grain for tractor brigade workers from the procurement stations.

Once the yield per unit area increases, the productivity of livestock products increases, the production of potatoes and vegetables develops, the income of collective farms and the wages per labor day increase, the wages of tractor drivers and other workers in the tractor brigade will also increase significantly. This will undoubtedly stabilize personnel and ensure better use of equipment.

The training system for tractor drivers, combine operators, and other workers must be fundamentally changed. So far, the training of these cadres has been very poor. A person attends a training class for two to three months, is taken to the machine a few times, and is considered a trained tractor driver. In the spring, this tractor driver will barely drive a tractor to the field. If the machine breaks down, he will have to sit by the tractor waiting for the mechanic to come because he does not know what to do. This reduces productivity, machines often break down, and the quality of work is poor. The system of short-term training classes that still exists today does not provide the trainees with the necessary technical knowledge. This situation must be fundamentally changed. It is necessary to train knowledgeable machine drivers and operators for machine-tractor stations who can operate tractors, combines, and other machines, and master the technology of mechanical work, repairs, and other work. To establish the training of personnel on a proper basis, it is necessary to reorganize existing mechanization schools and extend the training period. The training system for machine operators should be completed in the shortest possible time. There should be no delay in this matter.

In recent years, many experienced and skilled tractor drivers have left machine-tractor stations to work in factories in cities. We should call on these former machine operators to return to machine-tractor stations.

It can be expected that due to the inclusion of tractor drivers in the staffing of machine-tractor stations and the receipt of guaranteed higher wages, many former tractor drivers will also be willing to work in machine-tractor stations. It should be notified to the responsible persons of various departments not to prevent them from returning to work.

The issue of selecting managers for machine-tractor stations must be given special attention. In September 1951, the government issued a decision on "Measures to Improve the Work of Machine-Tractor Stations," which stipulated increased wages and bonuses for achieving planned production, as well as other forms of encouragement for managers of machine-tractor stations.

However, many local party organizations have not taken measures to supplement machine-tractor stations with skilled personnel, have not utilized the possibilities provided by this decision, and have not exerted much effort to encourage engineers and technicians to work in machine-tractor stations. Moreover, the vast majority of managers of machine-tractor stations are not up to the level of training in engineering, technology, and agriculture required for large-scale mechanized agricultural production. I will cite some figures to illustrate the level of education of the leadership of machine-tractor stations.

Education level (in percentage):
With higher education	With secondary specialized education	With primary education (actual work experience)
Director	22.6	47	30.4
Chief Engineer	14.8	20.8	64.4
Foreman	1.3	8.8	89.9

Many directors, chief engineers, and foremen of machine-tractor stations are filled by people who have not received specialized education, and this absolutely unacceptable situation must be paid attention to. It is not difficult to understand that due to the lack of necessary training, they often cannot cope with the work entrusted to them by the state. It is completely possible to appoint people who have received specialized education and can successfully manage such a large and complex enterprise as a machine-tractor station to these positions.

It should be noted that our educational institutions have not adequately considered the needs of agriculture when training senior and middle-level personnel. The work of training engineers and technicians for machine-tractor stations and state farms has been particularly poor. From 1940 to 1950, the total number of agricultural specialists increased by 53 percent, while the number of agricultural specialists with engineering education increased by only 12 percent.

The further improvement of the work of machine-tractor stations primarily depends on whether we can supply machine-tractor stations with managerial and engineering and technical personnel. The directors of machine-tractor stations should generally be mechanical engineers and agronomists who have received the necessary training in agricultural mechanization. It is necessary to appoint people who have received higher specialized education to be the chief engineers and chief agronomists of machine-tractor stations. Someone might ask: What should be done with machine-tractor station directors who have not received specialized education but have shown good managerial abilities? Of course, this question cannot be generalized. We have many machine-tractor station directors who, although they have not received specialized education, have become familiar with their business in actual work and are good at leading the work of machine-tractor stations. These workers should be retained in their positions and helped to obtain higher education.

To strengthen the work of machine-tractor stations with managerial and engineering and technical personnel, it is necessary to send mechanical engineers from industry and other sectors of the national economy to machine-tractor stations in the near future to serve as directors, chief engineers, and workshop foremen. It is necessary to send mechanical technicians to machine-tractor stations to serve as mechanics.

Machine-tractor stations have a lot of equipment, but it is not enough for us to successfully complete the tasks we face. Therefore, the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Party have drawn up a huge plan for the production of tractors and other machines, stipulating that from May 1, 1954 to 1957, 500,000 general-purpose tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower each), 250,000 cultivation tractors, and a large number of agricultural machines and automobiles will be supplied to agriculture. In the following years, machine-tractor stations will receive many new types of cultivation tractors and highly efficient machines for sowing and harvesting technical crops, feed crops, potatoes, and other vegetables, as well as machines for the full mechanization of mowing, harvesting green fodder crops, and labor-intensive operations in the livestock department. This will help to greatly expand the mechanization of agricultural production.

We must demand that industrial departments be more proactive in designing new machines and improving existing machines. Due to the lack of attention from the USSR Ministry of Machine Building and the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement, good new machines that are urgently needed for agriculture are often delayed for a long time without being manufactured, or the number manufactured is very small. Some departments have done a poor job in completing the production plans for some agricultural machines.

The quality of the machines produced is not good. Therefore, the complaints of agricultural workers are justified. For many years, combine operators, workers of machine-tractor stations, and state farms have pointed out the serious shortcomings of the C-4 self-propelled combine, which does not meet the needs of agriculture, especially the needs of agriculture in relatively humid regions. However, the USSR Ministry of Machine Building and the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement have not taken the necessary measures to eliminate these shortcomings.

The use of row planting allows tractor-drawn and horse-drawn inter-row cultivators to perform inter-row cultivation, which will play an important role in increasing the yield per unit area of intercropped crops such as corn, sunflowers, and castor beans. However, to adopt this method, seed row planters are needed. The work in this regard has progressed very slowly. It is true that the "Red Star" factory in Kirovograd produces a seed row planter for row planting of corn, sunflowers, and other crops. However, to obtain a square, manual correction is still needed. Moreover, this method of manual correction has not been effective and has not resulted in a square. Therefore, it is necessary to install an automatic device, like a potato planter, using a measuring gauge. The principle has already been successfully applied on the C-6 seed row planter.

It is necessary to manufacture a seed row planter to row plant intercropped crops in places where the planting density is relatively large. It should be ordered that research institutes and factories design this seed row planter more quickly. The USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement should organize the testing of this machine to enable factories to produce this machine and supply it to machine-tractor stations. Only by mechanizing sowing and inter-row cultivation can the yield per unit area of all intercropped crops be quickly increased. We have no other way. The workers, engineers, and technicians of our industrial enterprises must fully and timely complete the task of manufacturing high-quality machines, which is their glory.

In addition, special attention must be paid to the repair and maintenance of tractors and other machines. We can no longer tolerate the improper maintenance of the excellent equipment of machine-tractor stations, resulting in damage and inability to use them before their useful life expires. Many machine-tractor stations still do not have repair shops, rooms for parking machines, and sheds, and lack other production buildings.

The following facts illustrate the poor situation of machine-tractor stations: 429 machine-tractor stations do not have repair shops at all, and the equipment of the repair shops of about 5,000 machine-tractor stations is not sufficient and cannot meet the requirements for repairs. Many machine-tractor stations do not have the necessary housing for engineering and technical personnel, tractor driver dormitories, and other buildings. Although this situation exists, the funds allocated for the construction of production buildings and housing for machine-tractor stations over the past three years have only been used 80 to 85 percent. The local agricultural authorities are primarily responsible for this, as they have not taken measures to fully utilize these funds, and the party organizations have not provided the necessary supervision in this regard.

This mismanagement must be ended. In the next three years, each machine-tractor station must have a standard repair shop, at least two to three tractor parking sheds, two to three sheds for combines, a necessary number of sheds for agricultural machines, other production buildings, and housing. A considerable amount of funds has been allocated for these purposes. Our task is to properly and seriously use these funds and complete the assigned tasks.

The organization of the supply of equipment, tools, metals, and other materials, especially spare parts, to machine-tractor stations is very important.

It is necessary to more effectively utilize the existing rural power stations, build new power stations and wind power generators, and connect machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms with the national power system, thereby expanding the scope of electrification of agricultural production and enabling collective farmers to use more electricity in their daily lives. The supply of machines powered by electricity to agriculture is very important.

Due to the increase in the total amount of mechanization work in collective farms, machine-tractor stations have begun to receive more material remuneration. The current material wage rate is determined according to the following principle: the larger the harvest of a collective farm, the higher the material wage rate. This system has many shortcomings because the amount of the harvest depends not only on the quality of work of machine-tractor stations but also on the quality of work of collective farms.

It often happens that the same tractor brigade of a machine-tractor station works for two adjacent collective farms. However, one collective farm has a good harvest, while the other has a poor harvest. What is the reason? The reason is that the collective farm with a good harvest used good seeds and fertilizers, while the other collective farm did not do so, resulting in a poor harvest. The first collective farm generously paid the machine-tractor station for its work with materials, while the second collective farm paid very little remuneration, although the actual amount of labor expended by the machine-tractor station for each hectare in the two collective farms was the same. After the payment in kind, the amount of grain and other products remaining in the two collective farms for the payment of each labor day's wages is almost the same.

Given the current system of paying machine-tractor stations for their work in kind, it cannot encourage the most advanced collective farms. Therefore, it is necessary to determine a certain rate of payment in kind to encourage machine-tractor stations to strive for an increase in the yield per unit area. The Presidium of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Party instruct the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement to make suggestions on this issue.

It is necessary to stop the incorrect practice of determining the yield of grain and the production of other crops based on estimated figures rather than actual harvests. This system does not stimulate the increase of crop yields and even hinders the struggle against losses during harvesting (which is still serious in collective farms). The current method of estimating yields does not make the management of machine-tractor stations consistently act, and it does not make them care not only about increasing yields but also about not suffering losses during the harvesting of crops. It is necessary to organize the calculation of the actual amount of crops received in the warehouse and to give bonuses according to the actual amount received, so that the workers of machine-tractor stations will directly care about the actual harvest of grain and other crops.

The production relations between machine-tractor stations and collective farms will continue to be regulated by their contracts. It is necessary to amend the standard contracts according to the new tasks of machine-tractor stations. It must be emphasized once again that the contracts between machine-tractor stations and collective farms have legal force, and the performance of the contracts is the obligation of both machine-tractor stations and collective farms. Local Soviets and party organizations are responsible for ensuring that machine-tractor stations and collective farms systematically supervise the performance of the obligations stipulated in the contracts.

Therefore, to further improve the work of machine-tractor stations, it is necessary to:

Gradually make a group of skilled machine operators fixed personnel, for which purpose the training system for tractor drivers, combine drivers, and other machine operators must be fundamentally changed, and mechanization schools must be universally established to replace short-term training classes;

Strengthen the ranks of managers of machine-tractor stations;

Improve the role of machine-tractor stations in the further development of livestock breeding, resolutely improve the use of equipment, and ensure that agricultural work is carried out at the highest level and in the shortest possible time;

Establish tractor and agricultural machine repair shops, garages, and sheds in each machine-tractor station, and vigorously build housing for machine-tractor station experts and workers.

Party organizations must improve the leadership of machine-tractor stations, strive to further consolidate collective farms in organizational and economic terms, and play a greater role in agriculture. The guarantee of success lies here.

(6) The Work of Agricultural Authorities and Strengthening the Assistance to Collective Farms in Agronomy and Livestock Breeding

Comrades, the task of overcoming the backwardness of some sectors of agriculture and raising the entire agricultural production to a new, higher level has made great demands on the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement, the USSR Ministry of State Farms, local agricultural authorities, and all agricultural specialists.

The agricultural authorities employ tens of thousands of specialists who are loyal to our party and devote all their energy and knowledge to the continued development of agriculture. However, can we say that all agricultural authorities are doing their work well? No, comrades, we cannot say that. The facts show that the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement and the USSR Ministry of State Farms are unacceptably lagging behind the requirements of life and have not considered the changes taking place in collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms.

It should be pointed out that the organization of the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement itself and its local authorities are not suitable for quickly and effectively solving the problems arising in collective farms and machine-tractor stations. This organization is very complex, with many overlapping departments and often poor results. It is not surprising that this department cannot effectively and correctly lead local authorities and produce bureaucracy and paperwork when solving urgent problems. The connection between the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement and actual activities is very poor, and it has no connection with collective farms and machine-tractor stations. This department does not understand the local situation but tries to regulate the activities of local agricultural authorities, collective farms, and machine-tractor stations from the center and often issues instructions that are of no use to the local area.

Ask a comrade from North Caucasus if he has gone to the department to ask how to grow wheat? I believe you will get a negative answer. Ukrainian agricultural workers did not ask the Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement how to grow sugar beets, and Uzbek agricultural workers did not ask how to grow cotton. This is understandable because our country has cultivated experienced workers in various places. However, the department's workers still continue to lead as before, mistakenly believing that they are the only ones who understand everything and can do everything. V. I. Lenin pointed out: "If we apply the law unchanged to all parts of Russia, that would be a mistake." He said: "If in Central Asia, Ukraine, and Siberia, the same set of rules are used and they are all pressed into the same mold, that would be very absurd." These instructions are also useful today.

The shortcomings of the work of the Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement are particularly evident in agricultural planning. The plan has many unnecessary indicators, restricting the initiative of local authorities, machine-tractor stations, and collective farms. Just one point is enough: every year, the tasks of sowing and livestock breeding allocated to collective farms include 200 to 250 indicators. For example, the central plan includes such measures as when the fattening of pigs obtained by crossbreeding should be completed, the work of sowing tall plants as a fallow land screen, and many other tasks. Due to the assignment of a very complicated task with many indicators, it is inevitable that a large number of various reports will be made. Many agricultural specialists and collective farm workers spend their energy on making various reports, submissions, and statistics. In one year, each collective farm has to submit nearly 10,000 indicators to the district agricultural authorities. Compared with the pre-war period, the number of indicators in collective farm reports has increased by about eight times.

We criticize the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement, but this does not mean that we therefore underestimate its role. On the contrary, the role of the department should be strengthened. To adapt to the changed situation, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement must be reorganized, and the cadres must be significantly reduced.

The USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement should first draft the plans for agriculture and its various sectors, supply agriculture with materials, technology, and funds, procure agricultural products, select, appoint, and train personnel, promote advanced experience and scientific achievements, and solve the organizational problems of collective farms.

In this regard, the agricultural and agricultural procurement departments of the union republics and autonomous republics, as well as the agricultural and agricultural procurement bureaus of the territories and states, should play a more important role. This means that local agricultural authorities must be supplemented with capable personnel, reorganized, and the cadres must be reduced, and they must have closer ties with production.

Special attention must be paid to the issue of leading agriculture in the Russian Federation. More than 57 percent of the collective farms and 62 percent of the machine-tractor stations in the country are within the territory of the Russian Federation. The sowing area of the Russian Federation accounts for more than 62 percent of the total sowing area of the USSR. The number of livestock in the Russian Federation accounts for more than 50 percent of the total number of livestock in the country.

However, unlike other union republics, the Russian Federation has only recently had a real Ministry of Agriculture with the necessary powers and funds. Even the machine-tractor stations within the territory of this republic do not belong to the Ministry of Agriculture. Previously, the Ministry of Agriculture was tasked with the production of potatoes and vegetables, but in fact, the Ministry of Agriculture did not have the necessary materials and technical equipment for this. As a result, the Ministry of Agriculture had to limit its activities to issues such as rabbit breeding, beekeeping, and fur farming. This sounds like a joke, but unfortunately it is not a joke, it is a fact.

The Russian Federation, which has a variety of agricultural production, must have a real Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement with the necessary powers and funds. This department should be responsible for guiding the work of various sectors of agriculture and collective farms and machine-tractor stations within the territory of the Russian Federation.

The issue of strengthening the assistance to collective farms in agronomy and animal husbandry is also very important. We have done and are doing a lot of work in this regard. However, we have not yet fully utilized the possibilities in this regard.

The state has trained tens of thousands of agricultural specialists in institutions of higher and secondary education. The agricultural authorities alone have more than 350,000 specialists with higher and secondary education.

However, how are these specialists being used? As a result, only 18,500 specialists, that is, only 5 percent of the specialists, are directly working in collective farms. There is only one specialist for every five collective farms! Fifty thousand specialists, that is, 14 percent of the specialists, are working in machine-tractor stations. On the other hand, 75,000 specialists, that is, 25 percent of the specialists, are working in agricultural authorities. Their connection with the production of collective farms is very poor.

The issue of properly using agricultural specialists has been raised more than once. In recent years, the government has decided to increase the wages of specialists working in machine-tractor stations. Today, an agronomist and engineer working in production in a machine-tractor station receives wages that are not less than those of an engineer working in industry, and in many cases, even more. Although the government has made this decision, most of the specialists still prefer to stay in various authorities.

What is the cause of this abnormal situation? First of all, agricultural authorities have not solved the issue of using specialists from the perspective of state interests when solving the issue of using specialists. Many responsible persons in agricultural authorities believe that their main task is to write orders, regulations, and instructions, and they try to place specialists at the office desk. Agricultural authorities rarely try to arouse the professional pride of each specialist, rarely stimulate his creative spirit and the spirit of a reformer who is tenacious in improving cultivation and livestock breeding.

This attitude towards the valuable reserve of agricultural workers is fundamentally wrong. We must still make specialists work in production—collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms—and do their real work—improving the yield per unit area and developing livestock breeding.

The draft resolution stipulates that at least 100,000 agricultural specialists should be sent to work in machine-tractor stations by the spring of 1954, so that each collective farm has an agronomist, and large collective farms have an agronomist and an animal husbandry specialist. In a machine-tractor station that systematically serves a collective farm, the agronomist must check the implementation of the contract between the machine-tractor station and the collective farm. He is responsible for supervising the implementation of all measures stipulated in the agricultural technology regulations. An agronomist must not allow the concealment of poor-quality work, and he must remember that any slight liberalism towards the phenomenon of not following agricultural technology regulations and tolerating poor work is harmful to the collective farm and the state. An agronomist should be interested in every matter related to the quality of agricultural work, actively support the adoption of every new and advanced experience in collective farms.

It should be the responsibility of the chief agronomist of a machine-tractor station to act as a state inspector to supervise the quality of work stipulated in the contract between the machine-tractor station and the collective farm. In this regard, if the chief agronomist is directly led by the head of the state agricultural bureau in agricultural technology rather than by the director of the machine-tractor station, this is very correct. This is necessary because it can prevent the consideration of production and agricultural technology issues from being based on narrow local interests. Sometimes, a director of a machine-tractor station, in order to increase the productivity of a tractor and save fuel, will tolerate shallow plowing or delay the start of spring sowing work until the soil dries up. The responsibility of the chief agronomist of a machine-tractor station is to never allow violations of agricultural technology requirements under any circumstances and to always proceed from the following premise: only when the work of the machine-tractor station is completed at a high level and in a timely manner can a high yield per unit area be obtained. Agronomists must become true organizers of work for a bumper harvest.

The USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement must draft regulations on the status of the chief agronomist of machine-tractor stations, clearly and accurately defining his rights and obligations.

Due to the increasing organizational role of machine-tractor stations in the production of collective farms, the district agricultural and agricultural procurement bureaus are obviously no longer necessary. In the executive committees of Soviets, a few workers are needed to draft plans and do accounting work, and the main specialists should be transferred to work in machine-tractor stations and collective farms.

It is necessary to discuss in detail such an important issue as the propaganda and application of scientific achievements and advanced experience in agriculture.

Each collective farm, territory, and republic has many agricultural innovators, advanced collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms. In our time, managing an enterprise without drawing on the experience and achievements of innovators, advanced collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms means deliberately wanting it to fall behind.

Unfortunately, we are still doing very poorly in promoting and applying new things. Each collective farm—if we can put it this way—has to rely on its own strength, its own wisdom, its own experience, and its own actual work. However, with the rich experience accumulated by the advanced ones, we can apply it to all collective farms.

The agricultural and agricultural procurement departments and their local authorities have so far treated new things in agriculture with indifference and passivity, as if they had not seen them. Many valuable and tested methods for increasing the yield per unit area have not been adopted for many years.

Leading agriculture primarily means studying, summarizing, and promoting advanced experience and scientific achievements. Agricultural propaganda must become an important and indispensable part of the entire work of the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement and the USSR Ministry of State Farms and their local authorities.

It should be pointed out that the poor organization of the work of promoting advanced experience and scientific achievements is not only the responsibility of these two departments and their local authorities. There are also many party and Soviet authorities that have handed over this important task of agricultural propaganda to a small number of workers, while they themselves stand idly by.

The responsible persons of party and Soviet authorities must not only report on the necessity of promoting the best experience but, more importantly, they must study this experience themselves and actively promote it in various collective farms and state farms. Before calling on others to take action, a responsible person should go to the scene to study the advanced methods of management and enterprise management so that he can have a clear concept of the work he is calling on others to do and can provide the necessary instructions and assistance when visiting farms and state farms.

Party and Soviet authorities should call on the chairmen, management committee members, brigade leaders, team leaders, and individual collective farmers of backward collective farms to visit advanced enterprises and study their entire working methods in detail on the spot. Appropriate influence measures should be taken to make backward collective farms and state farms carry out their entire work according to the example of advanced collective farms and state farms.

Newspapers, especially agricultural newspapers, have done a poor job of propagating scientific achievements and the best experience. There are few excellent books published on these issues, and the books that are published often give a superficial account of the facts and do not grasp the essence of the new working methods.

The organization of the production of popular science and educational agricultural films is poor—the quality of the films is often unsatisfactory. Those responsible for the production of agricultural films are often people who have no contact with agriculture and lack knowledge of agriculture.

Now let's talk about the learning of collective farms and state farms in agriculture and animal husbandry. Currently, there are more than 2.5 million collective farmers and state farm workers studying in three-year training classes. This is of course a good thing. However, the teaching level is low and it is often detached from reality. This academic year, only 60 percent of the collective farmer students passed the exam. There are 30,000 collective farms that have not organized agricultural and animal husbandry learning for collective farmers.

Agricultural science plays a great role in the further development of agriculture.

It must be pointed out that Soviet science has made a great contribution to the development of agriculture, but it is still lagging behind the needs of production. Some research institutes and experimental stations have not solved the urgent problems of improving the efficiency of cultivation and livestock breeding well. In scientific institutions, criticism and self-criticism have not been fully developed, and there has been no development of creative discussions and free exchange of opinions. Some scientists often like to be flattered.

You know, the government is spending huge sums of money to develop science and has created very favorable working conditions for scientists. However, unfortunately, we still have some such scientific workers who, after defending their dissertations, actually do not continue their research work, and for many years have made no new contributions to science, collective farms, and state farms. Sometimes their dissertations have neither scientific value nor practical value. The backwardness of some research institutions from reality can be seen from the fact that the yield per unit area of crops and the productivity of livestock products in some experimental centers of research institutes and experimental stations are still inferior to those of advanced collective farms and state farms.

All scientific institutions must strive to solve the problems of increasing the yield per unit area, developing livestock breeding, the economic and organizational problems of agriculture, and the mechanization and electrification of the production of collective farms and state farms.

The agricultural exhibitions of districts and states should become an important form of propaganda of scientific achievements and promotion of advanced experience, as well as a competition for the widespread application of these achievements and experience. Before the war, many districts and states held such exhibitions every year. In recent years, they have paid little attention to organizing them. This situation should be improved. The central cities of each district and state must hold agricultural exhibitions every year. Each advanced collective farm, each state farm, and each machine-tractor station should have the opportunity to display its achievements and experience at the agricultural exhibition. Unlike the past, the exhibition should set aside a certain place to display the production indicators of backward collective farms and state farms, so that they can see how far behind they are from the best enterprises. This will prompt them to learn the advanced methods of these advanced collective farms. It is proposed to pass a resolution on holding the USSR Agricultural Exhibition in 1954.

Therefore, to improve the work of various agricultural authorities and strengthen the assistance to collective farms in agronomy and animal husbandry, it is necessary to:

Fundamentally improve the leadership of agriculture and raise it to the level of being able to complete new tasks;

Strengthen the role of agricultural authorities in the development of agriculture, increase the number of personnel in agricultural authorities, and make their connection with machine-tractor stations and collective farms closer;

Improve the technical services of agricultural and animal husbandry methods of collective farms, send at least 100,000 agronomists and animal husbandry specialists to work in collective farms, so that each collective farm has one or two specialists;

Resolutely strengthen the work of promoting advanced experience and agricultural scientific achievements.

The shortcomings I mentioned in the leadership of collective farms and machine-tractor stations also fully apply to state farms. The high cost of production of grain, meat, dairy products, and other items in state farms is still a major shortcoming in their work.

The state has prepared all the necessary conditions for the good management of each state farm, but due to the difference in leadership quality, the results are completely different.

Here is an example. The "Miners" State Farm and the "Komsomol" State Farm are both in the October District of Rostov State, and their production conditions are almost the same, but here are the results of their work in 1952:

Miners State Farm
Total sowing area 3,982 hectares
Total number of cattle 1,190 heads
Including cows 352 heads
Pigs 813 heads
Milk production per cow 3,035 kg
Cost per centner of livestock products:
Milk 90 rubles
Pork 646 rubles
Amount delivered to the state:
Milk 9,595 centners
Meat 1,419 centners
Profit after settlement 686,000 rubles.

Komsomol State Farm
Total sowing area 3,222 hectares
Total number of cattle 1,117 heads
Including cows 409 heads
Pigs 661 heads
Milk production per cow 1,934 kg
Cost per centner of livestock products:
Milk 114 rubles
Pork 1,457 rubles
Amount delivered to the state:
Milk 6,279 centners
Meat 932 centners
Loss after settlement 407,000 rubles.

What is the cause of such a stark contrast in the results? Because the leader of the "Miners" State Farm is the experienced livestock breeder Comrade Bovarenkin, while the leader of the "Komsomol" State Farm, Comrade Ponderenko, is an unskilled poor organizer. Although it is obvious that he is not up to his job, the Ministry of State Farms has allowed him to serve as the director for ten years.

Many state farms are led by poorly trained workers. Among the 2,064 directors of state farms under the Ministry of State Farms, 644 directors, that is, 31 percent of the total, are even actual workers who have not received secondary specialized education. Among the responsible persons in various departments and livestock breeding departments, 93 percent have not received specialized education. In state farms, about three-quarters of the workers holding the position of chief mechanical engineer are actual workers.

Our task is to make every state farm profitable and produce a lot of commercial products. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to strengthen the ranks of the leadership cadres of state farms. It is necessary to carry out rectification work in backward state farms, eliminate waste phenomena, practice strict economy of state funds, and greatly reduce production costs. It is necessary to consider abolishing the current state subsidy system because it fosters a dependent mentality in the leaders of state farms and does not encourage them to fight tenaciously to improve the work of state farms.

We must make all state farms demonstration enterprises—that is our task.

(7) The Problem of Party Political Work in the Countryside

Comrades! To smoothly solve the agricultural tasks before us, party organizations must do a lot of organizational and political work. It is wrong to think that agriculture will calmly, smoothly, and naturally continue to improve.

The party and the government are now creating all the material, technical, and organizational conditions for further strengthening collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms. Some of our workers may develop a mentality that now everything is fine and we can rest easy. There is no more dangerous mentality than this. This mentality can cause great harm.

Without the organizational work of party state committees, district committees, party primary organizations, and the leaders of machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms, material conditions and potential will not spontaneously produce the desired effects. To utilize these potentials and conditions, we must mobilize all our manpower and material resources, do a lot of organizational work, and mobilize the broad masses of collective farmers, machine-tractor station workers, and state farm workers to complete the task of further improving agriculture.

We have considerable strength in the countryside. Now there are 76,000 collective farms with collective farm party organizations. The number of party members in the countryside has now exceeded one million. There are more than two million Komsomol members in the countryside. If we can correctly dispose of and utilize these forces, then we can complete all these tasks and overcome all the difficulties we encounter on the road to our goal. For this, district party organizations should rely more on non-party activists and advanced figures in collective farms.

In recent years, the measures taken by the party to expand party democracy, expand criticism and self-criticism, have to a great extent promoted the initiative of party members, strengthened party organizations, and strengthened the connection between party organizations and the labor masses.

At the same time, it must be admitted that the work of rural party organizations still has serious shortcomings. In many party organizations, party political work is detached from economic tasks. Our workers talk a lot about politics and economics being inseparable and about politics having to be combined with the completion of economic tasks, but in reality, they separate political work from daily economic construction work. This phenomenon can be seen first in the work of agricultural leaders, especially collective farm chairmen.

To achieve results, we must focus on the main aspects, and the main aspect is to strengthen machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms with skilled and capable cadres and our excellent workers. To complete the urgent tasks in agriculture, it primarily depends on strengthening machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms with experienced, tested, honest, and capable organizers who can organize work and correctly select and assign personnel.

No instructions, no matter how well and how detailed they are, can play the role they should in improving agriculture if there are no good executors and capable organizers to carry them out on the spot. If the leaders of collective farms are not experienced workers, instructions will bring no benefit.

Collective farms have grown and have become large-scale farms with diverse economies. Before the merger, the average collective farm had 589 hectares of arable land, and now it has 1,693 hectares. Leading such a farm is indeed a complex and responsible task.

The Central Committee of the Party and the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a decision three years ago on strengthening the cadres of collective farm chairmen and other leaders. Work has also been done in the past to improve the selection of cadres for collective farm leaders. A considerable number of specialists and actual workers with organizational experience have been promoted to the position of collective farm chairman.

However, the supply of cadres to strengthen the work of collective farms is still poor. Only 16,600 collective farm chairmen have higher or secondary specialized education. The education level of the majority of collective farm chairmen is still very low.

Due to the poor selection of collective farm chairmen, they are often transferred. About one-third of the collective farm chairmen have terms of less than one year. Many collective farms change chairmen two or three times a year. Among them, many are dismissed for being unable to perform their duties or for abusing their power. There are many such cases: district party committees transfer those who have failed in their work or have committed theft from one collective farm to another, forcing farmers to accept them.

Now the task is to strengthen the cadres of collective farm chairmen in a short period of time and improve their education. At the same time, it is necessary to pay great attention to the selection of brigade leaders. With the merger of collective farms, brigades have also begun to expand, and it is necessary for experienced people, good organizers, and honest collective farmers to lead them.

The party has cultivated many excellent cadres in the countryside. In many districts, it is possible to strengthen the cadres of collective farm chairmen with local workers. However, we still have many districts that need help in this regard. It is worth noting that in many states, there is a certain difficulty in the issue of collective farm cadres. These difficulties are due to the loss of a considerable number of cadres during the war. In addition, in the post-war years, a large number of collective farmers with the highest education and culture have transferred to the industrial sector. Therefore, the possibility of selecting good cadres in some districts is restricted. We must help these districts.

In addition to selecting local cadres and transferring specialists, it is also necessary to send party members from various industrial centers to take up the leadership work of collective farms.

The party has sent 25,000 workers to the countryside, and they have done great work in the socialist transformation of agriculture. In addition, the party sent 17,000 party workers to help collective farms in 1933, taking up the work of political departments. In various periods, thousands of other industrial workers have been sent to machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms. This is a great help to collective farmers. Most of the workers sent have enthusiastically engaged in this work and have gloriously repaid the party's trust. Although they did not initially have the necessary agricultural knowledge, they quickly mastered their business because of their high political education and organizational work experience and proved to be capable leaders, doing a lot of work to consolidate collective farms. We can cite many examples to illustrate the excellent work done by party members sent to the countryside. Party organizations should fully support these people because they are doing arduous and noble work for the people, consolidating the alliance between workers and peasants.

In the current situation, the help of socialist cities to collective farm villages is an important form of further strengthening the alliance between workers and peasants—the unshakable foundation of Soviet social forces.

We can confidently say that if the party issues a call to party members in industrial centers, many volunteers will be found who are willing to go to the countryside to work and contribute their strength and knowledge to the cause of further consolidating the system of collective farms. We must send party members who understand the importance of this work and have been tested, and those who regard themselves as permanent rather than temporary workers in the countryside. We must take care of them.

If we strengthen collective farms with cadres, then various kinds of commissioners who often do not understand agriculture and do not provide the necessary assistance to collective farms on a regular basis will no longer be needed. Sending workers to collective farms to do permanent work is incomparably better than sending commissioners.

The urgent task of improving agricultural leadership is to improve the role of district party committees and district executive committees of Soviets in the development of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms. If we do not strengthen the district link, do not correctly allocate party forces, and do not skillfully organize the entire party work, we will not be able to raise the leadership of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms to the level of adapting to new tasks.

Many agricultural districts do not have enough trained party and Soviet cadres. The working ability of some district party committee and district executive committee of Soviets personnel does not meet the increased requirements for leaders. It is particularly necessary to talk about the cadres of district party committee secretaries of agricultural districts. If we examine the resumes, the situation is more or less satisfactory. More than 90 percent of the secretaries have been party members for eight years or more, and 80 percent have received secondary and higher education.

Where is the weakness of the leadership cadres of agricultural districts? The weakness is that some of them do not understand agriculture very well and do not have the necessary organizational work experience. About half of the district party committee secretaries of agricultural districts have been doing party work for less than five years. One-third of the secretaries have been doing this work for less than a year. Many district party committee and district executive committee of Soviets leaders are inexperienced cadres who find it difficult to lead districts, machine-tractor stations, and collective farms at the required level.

Can we send the necessary party and Soviet cadres to strengthen the district link? Of course, we can. We just need to correctly allocate and use manpower, reduce the personnel of state, territorial, and republican central institutions, abolish redundant upper-level institutions, and transfer a large number of excellent workers to strengthen the district link, collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms.

Some states have not trained the necessary cadres for party and Soviet work, and therefore transfer workers with poor work ability. If there is no help from the Central Committee, such states will find it difficult to solve the problem of improving district leadership with their own strength. We should help them. Therefore, it is necessary to select several thousand excellent cadres from excellent communists and send them to work in the district party committees and district executive committees of Soviets of agricultural districts.

It should be noted that the issue of replacing inexperienced leadership cadres must be handled with care. Party and Soviet workers with weak abilities can only be replaced by stronger, more trained, and more experienced workers. Those who are removed from office, if they have a good attitude towards the party, should be sent to training classes and party schools for education to make them good leaders. It is obviously beneficial to include the study of technical, economic, and organizational issues of socialist agriculture in the curriculum of cadre training classes and party schools.

Rural work is the most important and glorious work. Party organizations must eliminate the arrogant and bureaucratic attitude of some communists, even those in responsible positions, towards the countryside. Some workers still regard the work of agricultural districts, machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms as secondary work. Such people do not understand this simple truth: without the rise of agriculture, it is impossible to successfully solve the tasks of communist construction. Without abundant grain, meat, milk, oil, vegetables, and other agricultural products, a communist society cannot be built.

Our task is to make party organizations pay attention to the rapid development of agriculture. It is necessary to strengthen the cadres of all departments related to the leadership of agriculture. A large number of specialists working in offices should be transferred to production to strengthen the cadres of leaders and general cadres of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms; strengthen the cadres of district party committees and district executive committees of Soviets. This work must begin immediately and be basically completed by next January or February, so that thousands of newly promoted capable party and non-party organizers can fight for increased production and the development of livestock breeding by next spring.

Next, it is necessary to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible for the leadership of machine-tractor stations and collective farms. In each district, there are a large number of party, Soviet, and agricultural authorities, and each collective farm has almost five or six responsible workers. Under such circumstances, no one actually takes responsibility for the affairs of collective farms and machine-tractor stations, and no one takes care of political work among the masses.

It can be said that the district party committee secretary, the chairman of the district executive committee of Soviets, the head of the agricultural department of the district executive committee, the director of the machine-tractor station, and many other people are all responsible for the work of collective farms and machine-tractor stations. But who is actually responsible for collective farms in the district? No one can give you a positive answer because no one is responsible for a specific collective farm. This is where the fundamental shortcomings in the leadership of collective farms lie. In fact, there is no one responsible for the leadership of collective farms, and often the leadership is carried out in this way: party committee or district executive committee of Soviets workers travel by car to inspect collective farms, and in one day they travel around half the district, often issuing orders without even getting off the car.

There are also major shortcomings in the leadership of the primary party organizations of collective farms. This is first reflected in the fact that district party committees rarely work with the secretaries of collective farm party branches; they do not give the necessary attention to the consolidation of party organizations and the unification of non-party activists in collective farms around the party organization. In many party organizations, the work of educating communists in Marxism-Leninism is still done poorly.

State party committees and district party committees have not taken the necessary measures to improve the role of collective farm party organizations in solving the tasks of collective farms. Many collective farm party organizations are too large. Many collective farm party organizations are led by full-time secretaries. The Central Committee of the Party, at the request of the state party committees and district party committees, has decided that 3,747 collective farms with the largest party organizations can set up a full-time secretary. However, not all party committees take the selection of collective farm party branch secretaries seriously. Often, those who are immature, untrained, and sometimes even randomly selected are recommended for this work.

In many collective farms, political work among the masses is still at a very low level, and political education of the working people has not been given the necessary attention. There are some responsible persons who do not conduct in-depth daily work among collective farmers but only issue orders, violating Soviet laws. In many collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, the service for the cultural life of collective farm men and women, machine-tractor station workers, and state farm workers is very poor. Some district party and Soviet authorities pay little attention to organizing film screenings for residents.

Some districts also underestimate the role of Komsomol organizations as a powerful force in the struggle to improve agriculture. Few Komsomol members and rural youth are attracted to solve the tasks of improving agriculture and developing public livestock breeding.

In agriculture, women—our glorious collective farm women, machine-tractor station workers, and state farm workers—play a particularly important role, providing excellent examples of selfless labor in various production departments of collective farms and state farms. To be honest, many party organizations have not realized this, and the work done among women is not satisfactory.

State party committees and district party committees must resolutely eliminate these serious shortcomings and improve the level of political work among the broad masses of laborers.

To achieve this goal, it is necessary to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible for social and political work in the countryside and the leadership of machine-tractor stations and collective farms. The time has come for the leadership of the party to strengthen its connection with the production departments that have a decisive meaning. In the current stage, it is necessary to reorganize the work of party organizations in this way: certain collective farms are worked on by certain workers, and they are responsible for these collective farms, correctly selecting cadres, correctly allocating personnel, conducting political work among the collective farm members, and solving the tasks of these collective farms.

To exchange views on this issue, we now present our views as follows: We believe that the district party committee should have a group of workers led by the district party committee secretary in each machine-tractor station. For example, if a district has three machine-tractor stations, then this district can organize three groups of instructors (one group for each machine-tractor station), so that one collective farm (at most two collective farms) has one instructor who is responsible for the district party committee in the collective farm. The role of instructors in the general party organizations, especially in the district party committee, should be particularly strengthened. Therefore, attention should be paid to the selection and training of instructors.

The district party committee secretary who leads the group of instructors must guide his subordinate instructors to serve the collective farms in the area of the machine-tractor station, organize the work of the party in the workers of the machine-tractor station and various collective farms, and be responsible for the situation of these collective farms to the district party committee. To specifically lead the work of collective farms and primary party organizations, the district party committee secretary must spend all his working time in the machine-tractor station. This is good because it can reduce bureaucracy and do more practical work. Therefore, it is not necessary to set up a deputy director for political work in the machine-tractor station. The standing committee of the district party committee led by the first secretary should oversee the work of the group of instructors in various machine-tractor stations and collective farms, and at the same time lead all the economic and cultural life of the entire district.

We believe that the implementation of these measures can promote the entire organizational work and party work, and eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible for collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and primary party organizations.

Now let's talk about the shortcomings in the style and methods of leadership of agricultural work by the state party committee. The Central Committee of the Party has every reason to demand the improvement of this leadership work. The materials we have show that many party and Soviet leaders have not delved into the affairs of collective farms. These workers have not thoroughly studied the economy and advanced experience of collective farms, work roughly, and replace actual help to collective farms with empty talk and hot and cold work.

Even some state party committee secretaries do not understand agriculture, do not want to study it, but use some useless empty talk and shallow instructions to deal with it. If the leader of the state party organization does not even know which collective farm has a good harvest, which collective farm chairman is good, and which brigade leader is advanced, can we consider this normal? If the state party committee secretary or the secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of a union republic does not fully understand the advantages of advanced work methods in agriculture, does not know the livestock situation of collective farms in the state, for example, what crops are best as feed, and the yield of these crops in collective farms and state farms, can we allow such a situation to exist? Unfortunately, we still have such leaders.

It is necessary to resolutely eliminate the shallow methods of leading agriculture. To lead correctly, it is necessary to study the situation of various places, study the situation of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, and maintain close contact with cadres, especially with collective farm chairmen, study advanced experience and apply it in production. Party and Soviet leaders do not have to become agronomists, but they should be familiar with agricultural issues. Any worker who wants to become a truly useful worker can do this. I think such a requirement is completely correct.

Comrades! Now in various regions, there are many economically consolidated collective farms that have good harvests, high productivity of livestock products, successfully complete their obligations to the state, have high incomes, and guarantee high material and cash remuneration for the labor days of collective farmers every year. The implementation of the above-mentioned measures to further improve agriculture will ensure that the income of collective farms and collective farmers continues to increase significantly. The cultural and material demands of collective farmers will increase greatly and will continue to increase.

Therefore, we must talk about some issues of building cultural life and improving facilities in collective farm villages. Many workers ask: How will this work be carried out in the future? The answer is only one: It depends on the specific conditions. In places where collective farms have grown and have the necessary material potential for this (there are already quite a few such collective farms), it is necessary to first build production buildings and improve the construction of residential areas for collective farmers.

With the development of collective farms, collective farms will be able to use part of their income to build public buildings, nurseries, kindergartens, and maternity hospitals, thereby creating better conditions for collective farm women to engage in collective farm production and participate more actively in social life. In economically consolidated collective farms, funds can be allocated to build clubs, thereby creating better conditions for social and political work and cultural and educational work among collective farmers. It is suggested that collective farms help collective farmers repair and build houses, granaries, and courtyard buildings, help them obtain saplings of fruit trees planted in their own orchards, and supply collective farmers with fuel and other needs. At the same time, it must be remembered that the main aspect is to increase the harvest, develop livestock breeding, and develop various sectors of agriculture. Only on the basis of a new and significant increase in agricultural production can the task of improving collective farm villages be solved, and the task of further improving the cultural and living standards of collective farmers can be solved. Constantly caring for the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the working people is the most important responsibility of all party organizations and Soviets.

I would also like to talk about the issue of hamlets (XYTOP). Everyone knows that the republics along the Baltic Sea—Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia—have many hamlets. Now that these republics have basically completed the work of collectivization, some local workers have raised such questions: What to do with the hamlets? How to deal with the hamlets? We believe that there can be no two opinions here. In other republics and states, according to the decision of the government, the hamlets were abolished even before the war. We advocate the gradual abolition of the hamlet system and the establishment of public collective farm villages. This can create more favorable conditions for the improvement of collective farm production and can improve the cultural living conditions of collective farmers, establish good schools, hospitals, maternity hospitals, and children's welfare institutions.

However, it is wrong to rush into solving this problem in practice. Party and Soviet authorities should, together with collective farmers, comprehensively consider the possible local conditions and then, based on possible conditions, solve the problem of where, when, and how to carry out this work. We believe that the correct solution can be found. Collective farmers themselves do not want to live in hamlets, and they will raise the issue of improving cultural living conditions.

To implement the major measures for the further development of agriculture, it will to a great extent depend on the work of party organizations among the masses. The creative power of agricultural workers is boundless, and we should mobilize this power more actively. Party workers and all communists should widely publicize the urgent tasks of developing agriculture, promote the socialist competition to improve the yield per unit area of crops and the productivity of livestock products. To this end, it is necessary to often go deep into the masses, often do work among the masses, understand people well, understand their difficulties and demands, be good at discovering and supporting beneficial innovations in a timely manner, and prevent possible errors and failures. Party organizations should rely on the advanced figures in collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms in all their work, and their ranks will grow and strengthen day by day.

Party organizations must: ensure the improvement of party organizational work and mass political work, closely combine party political work with the work of solving economic tasks; immediately take measures to strengthen the cadres of district party committees, machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms, and raise the leadership work of all agricultural cadres to a higher level; change the incorrect view of some workers who regard rural work as secondary work; eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible for the leadership of collective farms, reorganize the district party committee organizations, and make party organizations and the production of collective farms and state farms closely connected; improve the level of leadership of state party committees and district party committees in agricultural work, resolutely prohibit the commandism of some workers.

The responsibility of party organizations is: to mobilize all male and female collective farmers, machine-tractor station workers, and agricultural specialists to struggle for further increasing the yield per unit area of various crops and developing public livestock breeding, so that each collective farm successfully completes its obligation to deliver agricultural products to the state, has the necessary seeds and other reserves, and ensures the further strengthening of public economy and the increase of remuneration per labor day of collective farmers.

Comrades! The Soviet state is extremely powerful and is advancing confidently towards communism. An important part of the program of communist construction is: on the basis of the great development of socialist industry—the leading force of the national economy—to actually solve the task of producing abundant agricultural products in our country.

Now, this task has become an urgent task for all our people. The successful solution of this task will also promote the further consolidation of the alliance between the working class and collective farmers.

We are confident that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working class, collective farmers, our intelligentsia, and all Soviet people will complete this task in the shortest possible time. This will be a big step forward for our country towards communism!

    关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施
    九月三日在苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议上的报告
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫
    同志们！苏联人民在发展社会主义工业方面所取得的巨大成就，使得共产党和政府能够直接着手解决在我国生产丰富的日用品的问题。
    伟大的列宁教导我们说：“大规模的机器工业（它同时能够改造农业）是社会主义唯一可能有的物质基础。”苏联人民在共产党的领导下已建立了全面发展的重工业，它是社会主义经济的强有力的基础。现在，有了这样的基础，就有实际的可能来组织轻工业和食品工业一切部门的迅速的高涨和大大地扩充日用品的生产，因为社会主义生产的主要目标和首要任务是最大限度地满足整个社会不断增长的物质和文化要求。
    但是为了组织日用品产量的迅速高涨，必须以加大的速度来发展我们的农业。
    在现阶段，最迫切的和首要的国民经济任务是：在继续大力发展重工业的同时，求得农业所有部门的迅速高涨，并在今后两三年内大大增加对我国全体居民的粮食供应，同时保证把全体集体农民的物质福利提高到更高的水平。
    因此，党中央委员会主席团认为，有必要把关于执行若干重要而迫切的措施以保证农业得到迅速高涨和多方面发展的建议，提交这一次的全体会议审议。
    （一）农业情况以及出产丰富的农产品的任务
    在共产党领导下建立起来的集体农庄制度比任何私人农业生产——不论是小规模的商品生产还是大规模的资本主义生产——具有决定意义的优越性。在乡村中，世界上最伟大的社会主义农业制度代替了旧有的制度——二千五百万分散的、小得可怜的个体农户——发展了并且巩固起来了。现在，我们国家的社会主义农业制度包括九万四千个集体农庄，八千九百五十个机器拖拉机站和四千七百多个国营农场。
    我们国家的农业是世界上机械化程度最高的。大家都知道，在资本主义国家中，现代的农业设备集中在一小撮农业资本家的手中，而在绝大多数劳动农民的耕作中，手工劳动和原始工具占统治地位。
    苏维埃国家以机器拖拉机站的头等设备供给农业，使它能够解决最重要的农业操作的机械化问题。在一九五二年中，集体农庄的操作的机械化程度，在谷物播种方面达百分之八十七，在用联合机收割谷物方面达百分之七十，在休耕地犁耕工作方面达百分之九十六，秋耕方面达百分之九十七，棉花种植方面达百分之九十八，甜菜种植方面达百分之九十五。农业生产的机械化大大减轻了集体农民的劳动，它使我们的社会大大地节省了劳动。它使我们国家的农业能按照现代的科学农学方针发展。
    有着现代化农业设备的集体农庄的公有企业正在发展和巩固。以集体农庄和国营农场为基础的社会主义农业的生产力愈来愈大，它的商品产量正在增加。例如，从一九二六—一九二七年到一九五二—一九五三年，农业的商品产量增加如下：谷物从一千零三十万吨增加到四千零四十万吨，马铃薯从三百万吨增加到一千二百五十万吨，肉类（毛猪的）从二百四十万吨增加到五百万吨，奶类从四百三十万吨增加到一千三百二十万吨。在棉花、甜菜和其他工业作物的生产方面已获得了巨大的成就。农业产量的增加使得社会主义国家有可能逐年增加农产品的数量，来适应工业对原料的需要和满足人民对食品的日益增长的需要。
    随着各集体农庄公有企业的巩固和进一步发展，它们的财富也在增加，集体农民的现金和实物收入也在增加。指出一点就够了，这就是集体农庄的公积金从一九四○年到一九五二年已增加了一倍。今天集体农民的实际收入已比革命以前的劳动农民的收入多了好几倍。乡村中已发生了深刻的文化革命。
    这一切都证明：集体农庄制度已按照新的社会主义方针根本地改变了生产基础和千百万农民的生活方式。集体农庄制度为苏维埃乡村所有的劳动人民开辟了走向富裕和有文化的生活的广阔道路。工人阶级和集体农民的联盟已成为一种不可战胜的力量。
    然而，我们必须很坦白地说，我们还没有好好利用大规模农业生产中的巨大的潜力。我们有着为数并不少的落后的、甚至处于无人过问状态的集体农庄和整个整个的区。在许多集体农庄和区内，作物的单位面积产量仍然很低。农业生产率、特别是饲畜业的产品生产率、粮食作物和饲料作物、马铃薯和蔬菜的种植提高得非常缓慢。我们的大规模社会主义工业的发展、城市人口的增加和劳动人民的物质福利的提高的速率，和目前农业生产的水平之间存在着明显的不平衡。
    我们可以引几件事实来说明。从一九一三年到一九五二年，苏联大规模工业的总产量（按比较价格计算）增加到二十七倍，生产资料的产量增加到四十七倍。社会主义工业的发展引起了城市人口的迅速增加：从一九二六年到一九五二年，城市人口已增加到三倍以上。随着社会主义社会财富的不断增加，劳动人民的物质福利也提高了。现在苏联职工们的实际工资比革命前的水平高好几倍。这就意味着我们的国家正在一年比一年繁荣，劳动人民的物质福利正在不断增进，因此，自然就会向农业提出越来越大的要求。
    然而，社会主义农业的发展速度显然是大大落后于工业发展的速度和人民对日用品需要的增长的。指出一点就够了：从一九四○年到一九五二年，工业产量增加到二点三倍，而农业总产量（按比较价格计算）仅增加了百分之十。
    我们国家的谷物供应有了保证，我们有着必要的国家贮备，而且在一定程度上还可以把谷物输出，在这种意义上，我们一般地是可以满足国家的谷物需要的。随着人民的物质福利的增进，人民的需要就逐渐从面包转移到肉类和奶类产品、蔬菜和水果等方面了。但是，正是在这些农业部门中，人民迅速增长的需要和生产水平之间的不平衡的状态近年来愈来愈明显了。一些重要的农业部门的落后，延缓了轻工业和食品工业的进一步发展，阻碍了集体农庄和集体农民的收入的增加。整个农业生产水平不高和若干重要的农业部门落后是什么原因呢？
    共产党曾坚持不渝地遵循尽力发展作为国民经济各部门顺利发展的必要条件的重工业的方针，并且在这方面已获得了重要的成就。注意完全集中在完成这个最重大的国民经济任务上，并且为完成这个任务指拨了大量的资源和经费。我们最好的干部都从事使国家工业化的工作。我们曾没有保证重工业与农业和轻工业同时迅速发展的可能性。必须为这个目的创造必要条件。今天，我们已具备这些必要条件了。我们有了一个强大的工业基础，力量日渐增长的集体农庄，和在经济发展各方面训练有素的干部。
    但是，若干重要的农业部门落后还有其他一些原因，这些原因的根源在于我们工作中的缺点，在于农业领导方面的缺点，就是说，这些原因是由于我们自己而造成的。
    在这些原因中，首先是某些农业部门违反了物质利益原则。一个企业和每一个工人因付出劳动而得到物质利益的原则是社会主义经营的基本原则之一。乌·伊·列宁指出，过渡到共产主义需要许多年的时间，在这个过渡时期中，经济“不应直接依靠热情，而应该以大革命所产生的热情为辅助，依靠个人利益，依靠对个人的鼓励和商业原则……”乌·伊·列宁进一步指出，否则，“我们将不能过渡到共产主义；我们将永远不能把这千千万万的人民带到共产主义。”
    然而事实证明，某些重要的农业部门没有应用这个物质福利原则，这个对劳动人民进行物质鼓励的原则。
    首先在饲畜业中就是如此，数字证明，中亚细亚各共和国的集体农庄把棉花交售和出售给国家的收入，每个劳动日单位是从十七卢布到三十六卢布，在乌克兰共和国甜菜每个劳动日单位的收入是十二卢布，在苏联，一般说来，把工业作物出售给国家，每个劳动日单位的收入差不多达十八卢布。例如，在机械化程度很高的地区，例如，在北高加索，集体农庄出售谷物每个劳动日单位得到八卢布到十四卢布的收入。同时饲畜业将产品交售和出售给国家的收入，在苏联每个劳动日单位平均仅为五卢布，乌克兰则只有四个多卢布。因此，和农业的其他部门比较，饲畜业处在经济上不利的地位。
    在饲畜业中，由于人力劳动占明显的优势，所以生产费用很大。同时，事实证明，现有的收购和购买牲畜产品的价格，不能作为刺激集体农庄和集体农民发展饲畜业的力量，而且在目前的情况下，它不能使集体农庄和集体农民得到应有的收入。蔬菜和马铃薯的情形也是如此。
    此外，许多集体农庄违反了集体农庄章程的最重要的规定。斯大林同志曾指出，集体农庄式的经济的基础是在个人利益服从公共利益的条件下，正确地把公共利益和集体农民个人利益结合起来的原则。
    从这个指导原则出发，集体农庄章程规定：在集体农庄内，存在着主要的、具有决定意义的公有经济，同时每一个集体农户有权经营小规模的私人经济。既然集体农庄的公有经济没有充分发展、又不能充分满足集体农庄的公共需要和集体农民的私人要求，那末，这种辅助经济是必要的。
    许多集体农庄已违反了这个集体农庄的主要原则。这不能不引起、而实际上已经引起了集体农民私人经济中乳牛、羊、猪的头数的减少。
    违反集体农庄和集体农民物质利益的原则在目前情况下特别表现得明显。我们的工业正在以很大的速度发展。它缺乏劳动力。我们老早就没有了失业现象。产业工人的工资不断提高，他们的生活一年比一年改善。在这种情况下，如果在公有经济中的工作没有使集体农民得到他应得的劳动日单位的应有收入，如果他的辅助经济中的私人利益又受到损失，那末，他很容易去寻找另外的职业——他跑到城市里去，跑到工厂里去做工。这就是集体农民私人经济缩减和落后的集体农庄的农业人口外流的原因。
    某些农业部门严重落后的一个重要原因是，对于国家供给和将继续供给机器拖拉机站的效力强大的设备，利用得显然不能令人满意。在若干农业部门和农业工作中，手工劳动仍然占优势。虽然谷物、甜菜和棉花种植的机械化水平颇高，而像饲畜业、马铃薯、蔬菜、亚麻等作物的生产这样一些重要部门的机械化却落后了。许多机器拖拉机站没有好好利用拖拉机和其他机器。
    若干农业部门严重落后的一个重要原因是，党、苏维埃和农业机关对于集体农庄，机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导不能令人满意，特别是在选择、配备和训练农业人员方面和在乡间进行党的政治教育工作方面。
    最后，必须谈一谈集体农庄本身、集体农庄主席和集体农庄管理委员会、集体农民方面的原因。在许多集体农庄里面，劳动纪律仍然松懈，并不是全体集体农庄庄员都充分参加了集体农庄的生产。并不是每一个地方集体农民的劳动都组织得很好。仍然存在有不少对于公共财产采取不负责任和忽视态度的情形。
    进一步发展社会主义农业的目标是为了增进人民的福利。大家都知道，随着社会主义的胜利，群众的消费量也不断增加。例如，在过去二十八年中，消费品的生产量约增为十二倍，其中供给居民的食品的数量大大地增加了。然而，苏维埃人民的福利、购买力和需求发展得更快，食品生产量远不能满足他们不断增长的要求。因此，改进居民的饮食的任务就具有特别重要的意义了。
    我们一定要为我们自己规定这样一个任务，使食品消费达到以科学为根据的、一个健康的人全面协调发展所需要的饮食标准的水平。在这一方面，主要任务是改进消费品的成分，其主要办法是提高牲畜产品和蔬菜的产量。
    为了充分满足居民在奶类和奶产品方面的需要，必须从我们国家内每一百公顷可利用的耕地、草地和牧场得到二十六吨牛奶。并且，为了要得到二十六吨牛奶，我们在每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场上至少要有十头母牛，每年平均产量达二千五百到二千六百公斤。
    为了满足居民对肉类和肉类产品的需要，必须从每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场得到二点七吨肉类。养猪业必须广泛地发展，每一百公顷耕地至少要生产三吨猪肉。
    我们在每一百公顷耕地上要喂三百四十只母鸡，每只母鸡每年至少生一百一十个蛋。
    必须大大增加糖、瓜类作物、水果、浆果和其他产品的产量。
    我们的责任是尽速地达到这样一个食品生产水平。达到这样一个水平所需要的时间将大部分取决于我们自己，取决于我们的领导和党组织的组织工作。如果我们集中我们的能力、资源和力量来解决这个问题，不把我们的领导限制在一般指示上而努力加强每一个集体农庄、每一个国营农场、每一个机器拖拉机站，我们将在很短的时期中达到这样一个消费水平，有许多产品，只要两三年就行了。
    我们有相当多的、在为我们国家出产丰富的粮食方面贡献了全部力量的集体农庄。在过去两三年中，许多这种集体农庄已从落后状态进入先进的队伍中去了。以莫斯科州拉孟斯基区的莫洛托夫集体农庄为例。三年前，一些大大落后于莫洛托夫集体农庄的较小的集体农庄与它合并了。由于以普扎奇科夫同志这样一个卓越的集体农庄生产组织者为首的集体农庄委员会的精明的经营，在过去两三年内整个集体农庄，包括与莫洛托夫集体农庄合并的以前落后的集体农庄在内，已大有进展，已成为一个高度发展和获利甚厚的企业了。每头母牛平均每年的产乳量已从二千五百公斤增加到四千二百零八公斤。一切作物的收获量都增加了，其中马铃薯每公顷增加到十六点二吨，蔬菜每公顷增加到二十九点四吨。牲畜的数目也增加了，这个集体农庄正在得到愈来愈多的牲畜产品。
    饲畜业的高度生产率和一切作物的极高的单位面积产量，已使莫洛托夫集体农庄有可能获得三百万卢布的现金收入。这个集体农庄去年为建筑牲畜房花了六十一万二千卢布。集体农民每一劳动日单位得到二十五个卢布八十戈比（以现金计算）。
    假使我们把上述满足居民们在牲畜产品方面的需要所必需的标准，和莫洛托夫集体农庄的实际成绩相比较，我们可以看出下列的情况：
    要保证居民的消费量，根据以科学为基础的标准，必须：
    每一百公顷的耕地、草地和牧场有二十头食用牛和乳牛
    其中包括十头母牛
    肉类净重二千七百公斤
    奶类二十六吨
    每头母牛平均产奶量是二千五百到二千六百公斤
    莫洛托夫集体农庄在一九五二年有：
    每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场有三十五头食用牛和乳牛
    其中包括十九头母牛
    肉类（净重）三千一百公斤
    奶类七十一吨
    每头母牛平均产奶量是四千二百零八公斤。
    根据所有上述指标，莫洛托夫集体农庄已经超过了我们必须达到的全国标准。应该记住，莫洛托夫集体农庄的数字只包括公有的牲畜，也就是说，不包括集体农民私有的牲畜在内。
    假如我们所有的集体农庄都达到了莫洛托夫集体农庄的水平的话——这项工作是每一集体农庄力所能及的——生产丰富的农产品的问题就解决了。
    社会主义农业有一切可能性，来在可能最短的时期内，解决充分供应苏联人民以粮食，供应工业以原料的问题。但是，要把这种可能性变为现实，就有必要在组织上和经济上加强所有的集体农庄，首先是在每一个集体农庄里，把有能力成功地管理大规模的社会主义企业的有才干的组织者提升到领导地位。
    给予集体农庄以及集体农民更多的物质鼓励以增加作物收获量并发展公有饲畜业，这是至关紧要的。为此，苏联部长会议和党中央委员会主席团认为有必要提高牲畜产品、马铃薯和蔬菜的收购与购买价格。例如，以义务交售方式交售给国家的牲畜和家禽的收购价格就提高到五点五倍以上，奶类和牛油二倍，马铃薯二点五倍，蔬菜平均提高百分之二十五到百分之四十。
    至于购买价格，肉类平均提高百分之三十，奶类百分之五十。同时有必要指出：牲畜产品、马铃薯和蔬菜的零售价格并没有增加，正好相反，而是每年降低。降低消费品零售价格的政策将始终如一地继续下去。
    在目前情况下，降低集体农民义务交售给国家的牲畜产品标准，降低集体农庄交售的马铃薯、蔬菜标准是适当的。工人和职员的饲畜业义务交售牲畜产品的标准大大地降低了。
    由于义务交售标准降低，集体农庄和集体农民将有更多的剩余产品以较高的购买价格以及集体农庄市场价格出售。在这方面，有必要修改目前的国家与合作社收购制度。有必要从目前的收购制度转变到合同制度，这将使国家能事先计划除义务交售以外所收到的产品的数量，并给集体农庄和集体农民以保证，保证他们产品的售出，同时使他们能够预支款项，以相互买卖方式，买进必要的工业品。
    为执行使农业进一步发展的紧急措施，苏维埃国家今年将再支出一百五十多亿卢布，一九五四年将支出三百五十多亿卢布。在这些支出中，有相当大的一部分规定用来对农业作新的基本投资，给予集体农庄和集体农民更多的物质鼓励以鼓励他们发展饲畜业，生产马铃薯和蔬菜，以便在今后数年中，使农业的这些部门获得显著进展。由于执行上述措施的结果，集体农庄和集体农民在一九五三年将得到一百三十多亿卢布的额外收入，在一九五四年将得到二百多亿卢布。
    提高收购和购买价格，降低义务交售标准，对于增加集体农庄和集体农民在进一步发展农业方面的物质利益是至关紧要的。不过，有必要正确地估计这些措施的经济方面。在目前，它们的重要性和必要性是明显的。但是决定集体农庄生产发展的主要道路的并不是它们。
    社会主义社会经济的一个特点是在生产改善、劳动生产率提高和产量增加的基础上进行有步骤的减低物价。克服饲畜业、马铃薯和蔬菜生产中的落后状态和取得所有农业部门继续强大的高涨的主要方法，是提高集体农庄生产水平，增加总产量和商品产量，减低生产品的单位成本。然后，在现有的收购和购买价格的水平上，集体农庄生产的所有部门将得到巨额的收入。
    现在已经有成百上千的先进集体农庄以现有的收购和购买价格向国家义务交售和出售肉类、乳类、羊毛、马铃薯和蔬菜而得到巨额的收入。这样的集体农庄不但胜利地履行了他们对国家的义务，而且保证了每年使固定公积金增加和使每个劳动日单位的报酬优厚。因此，这不仅是提高收购和购买价格的问题，而且主要是经济发展的水平的问题。
    拿具体的集体农庄来做例子，可以更好地说明这一点。科斯特罗马州科斯特罗马区的“十月十二日”集体农庄和“五一”集体农庄，土壤和气候条件差不多都相同，然而它们工作的结果则大不相同。
    这可以从下列数字得到说明：
    “十月十二日”集体农庄和“五一”集体农庄一九五二年经济指数的比较如下：
    “十月十二日”集体农庄
    耕地、草地和牧场面积九百九十八公顷
    作物产量每公顷以吨计算：
    谷物——一点八五
    马铃薯——十九点五
    蔬菜——十六点四
    每头母牛产奶五千二百三十三公斤
    公有牲畜头数（每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场上所有牲畜头数）：
    食用牛和乳牛——二十六
    其中有母牛十头
    猪（每一百公顷耕地）——一百四十二
    家禽（每一百公顷耕地）——二百四十
    所得畜产品（每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场）：
    肉类（净重）——一千三百公斤
    乳类——五十点九吨
    集体农庄现金收入——二百一十万零九千卢布
    每公顷耕地、草地和牧场收入——二千一百一十三卢布
      “五一”集体农庄
    耕地、草地和牧场面积九百零四公顷
    作物产量每公顷以吨计算：
    谷物——零点七一
    马铃薯——七
    蔬菜——八点六
      每头母牛产奶一千二百七十二公斤
    公有牲畜头数（每一百公顷的耕地、草地和牧场）：
    食用牛和乳牛——十三
    其中有母牛六头
    猪（每一百公顷耕地）——八
    家禽（每一百公顷耕地）——十五
    所得畜产品（每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场）：
    肉类（净重）——五百公斤
    乳类——八点五吨
    集体农庄现金收入——十五万一千卢布
    每公顷耕地、草地和牧场收入——一百六十七卢布
    “十月十二日”集体农庄获得成就的秘诀是由于适当地挑选和配备了工作人员。这个集体农庄是由普拉斯科薇雅·安德烈耶夫娜·马利宁娜领导的，她非常熟悉业务，并且把农庄管理得非常好。马利宁娜同志管理的优点就是她和她所领导的集体农庄管理委员会善于依靠集体农民和集体农庄的积极分子。在这里，集体农庄党组织在领导企业和教育集体农民方面所起的作用确实是明显的。
    可能举出许多这样的例子。所有这些都证明各集体农庄对于进一步发展农业是具有多么巨大的潜力。
    我再来继续详细地分析农业各部门的情况。
    （二）饲畜业的情况和进一步发展饲畜业的措施
    我们在饲畜业方面面临着最迫切的任务，因为饲畜业的落后具有长期性质，不采取决定性的措施，我们就不能迅速改善这种情况。
    我们的饲畜业在战前期间就已经落后。在战后年代中，为了恢复和进一步发展饲畜业，已做了许多工作。从一九四五年七月到一九五三年七月期间，苏联的食用牛和乳牛增加了一千一百三十万头，绵羊和山羊五千三百九十万头，猪二千五百一十万头。
    初看起来，有了这样的增加数字（的确，这些数字是很巨大的），似乎就不必感到惊慌。可是，实际情形并不是这样的。
    让我举出一些数字来说明苏联牲畜头数的情况
  （根据所比较的牲畜在年初的头数，单位百万）：
    这些数字说明我国的母牛在一九五三年年初比一九四一年年初要少三百五十万头，比一九二八年年初要少八百九十万头。
    沿着扩大再生产方针发展的整个农业前进得颇远，而饲畜业的发展则极端缓慢。集体农庄和国营农场的牲畜产品生产率仍然低。某些州和共和国的乳牛产品生产率的情况特别不能容忍。例如，一九五二年，基洛夫州集体农庄每头乳牛产乳七百二十七公斤；诺夫哥罗德州的集体农庄七百七十七公斤；倭罗格达州八百一十九公斤；科斯特罗马州九百零六公斤；阿塞拜疆共和国每头乳牛产乳三百七十三公斤；格鲁吉亚共和国四百五十七公斤；吉尔吉斯五百三十七公斤；亚美尼亚八百一十四公斤；白俄罗斯八百二十九公斤。
    必须在最短期间克服饲畜业方面的落后状态，首先要发展集体农庄和国营农场的饲畜业，并采取决定性的措施来增加集体农庄和国营农场的牲畜的头数和提高牲畜的产品生产率。
    在战后年代中，集体农庄的饲畜业已有迅速的发展。在一九五三年年初，集体农庄的食用牛和乳牛比一九四零年增加了一千零二十万头，其中母牛增加了二百八十万头；绵羊和山羊增加了三千五百三十万头；猪增加了七百九十万只；家禽增加了五千八百万只。
    如果我们克服横在发展公有牲畜的道路上的、并且已延缓了牲畜繁殖过程的严重困难，那末，集体农庄牲畜头数将增加得更快。问题在于：饲畜业中的饲料生产、房舍的建筑和费力工作的机械化，大大落后于集体农庄牲畜头数的增加速率。
    我们能够在最短期间克服这些困难吗？如果我们更好地领导饲畜业的发展，如果我们为牲畜饲养部选择优秀的工作人员并很好地教育他们，而且增加集体农庄和集体农民在发展公有饲畜业中的经济利益，那末，我们一定能够而且也会克服这些困难的。
  在这方面，首先我要详细谈谈关于牲畜产品的收购的情形。目前，收购工作往往限于按照集体农庄的牲畜头数来机械地分配任务，每公顷交售的原则被粗暴地违反了。那些饲畜业发达的州和区的先进集体农庄，每年被分配以愈来愈多的交售牲畜产品的任务，而那些不关心公有饲畜业发展的集体农庄被分配的任务较少，实际上，它们被分配的是特殊的定额。这种办法破坏了集体农庄和集体农民在发展公有牲畜头数和提高它的产品生产率中的经济利益。
    下面是一个典型的例子。莫斯科州的集体农庄，每一公顷的耕地、草地和牧场交售给国家三十九点五公升牛奶，而利森州的集体农庄只交售十四点八公升。莫斯科州的卢霍维齐区和利森州的里布诺夫斯克区发展饲畜业的条件都差不多。而卢霍维齐集体农庄每公顷交售给国家五十七公升牛奶和五点五公斤肉类，而里布诺夫斯克区的集体农庄只交售三十一公升牛奶和四点七公斤肉类。乌克兰的集体农庄每公顷交售给国家的牲畜产品要比别的地方，例如白俄罗斯的集体农庄，多得多，这是没有理由的。乌克兰集体农庄每公顷交售的肉类数量规定为六点三公斤，牛奶二十五公升，而白俄罗斯集体农庄肉类是三点九公斤，牛奶十二点八公升。但是白俄罗斯的发展饲畜业的条件，特别是养猪的条件很好。白俄罗斯的党组织和苏维埃机关并没有真正尽力争取增加牲畜头数和提高它的产品生产率。在一九五二年，白俄罗斯集体农庄每一百公顷耕地养的猪不到一只，同时猪肉在交售的肉类总量中只占百分之十三，这并不是偶然的事。
    有什么理由为在饲畜方面有着大致相同的发展条件的集体农庄，定出不同的交售定额呢？收购工作者试图辩解说，这是因为各集体农庄、各区和各州的经济发展不平衡。他们认为，较为发展的农庄应交售更多的产品：既然你今年保存下了较多的幼畜，得到了较多的牛奶，那么就应分配到较大的交售定额。每当一个集体农庄发展到超出其邻近各农庄的水平时，收购工作者就来剪平它，就像公园花匠修剪园里的灌木丛一样。
    必须制止这种不能容许的事情。必须严格遵守党和政府在交售牲畜产品方面所订定的按公顷计算的原则，以便在一个行政区域内，一般只能有一个每公顷的交售定额。只有当土壤的性质有所不同时，才许可有与当地一般定额有某些出入的例外。
    正如我所说过的，集体农庄和集体农民们发展公有饲畜业的兴趣，大部分决定于收购牲畜产品的价格。由于收购和购买价格的提高，集体农庄今年已经可以从肉类和奶类上多获得三十八亿卢布的收入。向国家交售和出售牲畜产品的收入将成为集体农庄在饲畜业上的一笔主要收入。
    由于饲畜业没有充分地发展，某些集体农庄在牲畜产品的义务交售方面常有拖欠。党和政府的相应决定规定勾销集体农庄在过去几年中积欠的牲畜产品缴售数，以便使农业的这一部门有更多的可能来迅速发展。兹建议对于在过去几年中在牲畜产品交售方面有拖欠的饲养牲畜的集体农民、工人和职员也采取同样步骤，以便使他们得以尽速得到母牛。
    不仅是在牲畜产品的收购方面，在饲畜业发展的其它问题上也犯着严重的错误。一些年以来，苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部的领导，以及许多地方性机构的领导，对于饲畜业的情况没有表示真正的关怀，容忍不能令人满意的情况存在，没有提出、也没有解决发展饲畜业问题，而这是我们早就应该做的事。
    让我用几个例子来说明这一点。在集体农庄和国营农场中，母牛头数的情况是不能令人满意的。苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部以及许多地方苏维埃机关设法想使食用牛和乳牛的总数增加，却较少注意到尽量增加母牛的头数。
    一九五三年，集体农庄本来可以把母牛的数目增加一百五十万头，然而实际只增加了五十万头。其所以这样，是因为集体农庄把一百万头母牛代替猪和肥公牛交给了国家，同时有五十万头母牛拿去卖掉了，或者供集体农庄内部的需要。于是，一年之内用掉了一百五十万头母牛，占集体农庄全部母牛数目百分之十八。在倭罗格达州集体农庄的饲畜部门，去年这样用掉的母牛占他们母牛总数的百分之二十三，在哈萨克共和国，占百分之二十四，在基洛夫、莫洛托夫和乌拉季米尔等州，占百分之二十六。
    到一九五三年，母牛数目在全国食用牛和乳牛总数中占百分之四十三，而一九四一年占百分之五十一。在集体农庄里，母牛占食用牛和乳牛总数百分之二十八，在国营农场里则占百分之三十一。
    为了得到充足的牛奶，牛群总数中最低限度必须有百分之五十的母牛，在城市郊区最低限度必须有百分之六十，在哈萨克、中亚细亚、南高加索、北高加索的草原、半草原和高山地区，在阿斯特拉罕、契卡洛夫和赤塔等州，在布利亚蒙古苏维埃社会主义自治共和国和图瓦自治州等地的集体农庄，最低限度必须有百分之四十。可是，现在白俄罗斯共和国集体农庄的母牛只占全部牛群头数的百分之二十六，在乌克兰共和国、在库尔斯克和沃罗涅兹州只占百分之二十四，在罗斯托夫州只占百分之二十一，在摩尔达维亚共和国只占百分之二十一，这样我们怎能谈得上什么充足的牛奶供应呢？
    在主要的奶产品地区，如倭罗格达、亚尔干日尔、雅罗斯拉夫、坦波夫、莫洛托夫、斯维德洛夫斯克、库尔干、鄂木斯克和新西伯利亚各州，母牛的头数已大为减少。母牛头数增加的不足说明，为什么老早就已发展为主要的牛油供应地的各州，现在生产的牛油却比以前减少了。例如，在西伯利亚，一九一三年生产了七万五千吨牛油，而一九五二年却只生产了六万五千吨。
    在增加母牛方面国营农场也进展得很慢。现在它们有一百三十万头母牛，那就是比一九三五年少五十万头。由于苏联国营农场部人员所持的奇怪的“理论”，国营农场中有二十万头母牛不是用来挤奶而是用来喂牛犊的，结果，国家每年损失二十多万吨牛奶。戈尔诺阿尔泰斯克州党委员会书记索罗卡同志报告说，阿尔泰边疆区的阿贝和科克辛国营农场四年前就停止对二千头西门答拉母牛的挤奶工作。这些母牛中有的能供给三千公斤牛奶。这些国营农场交给国家三千五百吨牛奶，而现在这些牛奶却被用来喂牛犊，大量牛奶被浪费和盗窃掉了。
    决议草案规定要在一九五四年把母牛的头数增加到二千九百二十万头，比一九五三年年初增多四百九十万头，其中集体农庄母牛头数增加到一千一百五十万头，也就是在同一时期中增加三百万头母牛。
    兹建议，只要增加母牛的计划能够完成，关于食用牛和乳牛的计划便可算是完成。
    大家知道，许多年以来，计划和计算各种牲畜生产计划的完成情况的工作是从每年一月一日开始的。实际情况表明，这种手续毫无好处，而只有坏处。为了要实行增加牲畜的计划，集体农庄的饲畜业必须在一月一日以前养有很大一批不生产的、挑选出来准备交给国家、出卖及供食用的牲畜，它们必须向集体农民购买小牛，必须在秋季实行猪的转群，并且维持“公鸡”家禽部。
    在一月一日的调查以后，集体农庄便立刻要减少很大一部分牲畜。譬如，在一九五一年十二月，全国集体农庄交售给国家二十三万二千头食用牛，一九五二年一月便交售了八十八万九千头。一九五一年十二月，乌克兰共和国集体农庄交售了一万六千七百头牛，一九五二年一月交售二十一万九千头，即为原来的十三倍。
    据苏联中央统计局的估计，集体农庄为了完成一九五二年第一季的交售肉类计划，交售的食用牛比它们应该交的多二十万头，这是因为冬季缺少饲料，并且饲养得很差，使得牲口都很瘦弱的缘故。
    这使集体农庄和国家都遭到了极大的损失。
    在饲畜业中，经济年度实际到十月一日结束。到那个时候，草料的储存和冬季建筑的准备工作将告完成，家畜也长肥了，这将使集体农庄在夏季的牧放以后，得以长肥了的比较重的牲畜作为肉类交售，这样交纳的头数就可以少一些。到十月初的时候，在集体农庄中，分派牲畜用于不同目的（用于养育，选出作为食用等等）的工作将告完成。因此，有必要确定饲畜业的经济年度自十月一日开始。
    饲畜业发展中的最严重缺点之一是母牲口的不生育的现象过多，牲畜的死亡率，尤其是幼畜的死亡率很高。去年在集体农庄中，与一九四○年比较，每一百头母牛少生了十一头小牛，每一百头母羊少生了二十七头羔羊，每一百只母猪少生了一百六十三只幼猪。在过去两年中，在诺夫哥罗德、科斯特罗马和库尔干州以及阿尔泰边疆区的集体农庄，每三头小牛中就有一头死亡，在一九五二年，在倭罗格达州和伊凡诺佛州的集体农庄，每两头羔羊中就有一头死亡，在沃罗涅兹、坦波夫和罗斯托夫州的集体农庄，每五只幼猪中就有一只死亡，在白俄罗斯共和国，每四只幼猪中就有一只死亡。
    此外还能举出许多例子来证明对于发展饲畜业的领导是绝对不能令人满意的。
    但是，问题并不在于例子的多少。有一点是很清楚的：要使饲畜业摆脱目前的不受注意的状态，必须在采取许多措施之外坚决提高在发展饲畜业方面的领导水平。
    决议草案中提出了许多措施，争取在一九五四年大大增加各种有产品的牲畜的头数，并提高乳品产量、羊毛产量和牲畜肥度。由于计划增加牲畜头数和提高牲畜产品生产率，打算在明年把肉类总收购量提高到四百一十万吨（一九五二年为三百万吨），奶类一千四百三十万吨（一九五二年为一千万吨），蛋四十三亿个（一九五二年为二十六亿个），羊毛二十三万吨（一九五二年为十八万二千吨）。我已经说过，牲畜产品将按更高的新价格予以收购。
    必须坚决改善集体农庄和国营农场中的饲料状况。许多地区和集体农庄中不重视饲料来源的现象已经变得绝对不能容忍了。
    必须按照各地区的土壤和气候条件来决定发展不同饲料的生产。
    但是一切地区要尽一切力量增加多汁饲料的生产，这必须变成一条规则，因为假使没有多汁饲料，奶产量便不可能大大增加。譬如在中部地区，多汁饲料将为马铃薯、饲畜用甜菜及制糖甜菜、胡萝卜、南瓜和萝卜，南部地区的多汁饲料为饲畜用西瓜、南瓜和甜菜。
    同时还应更多注意种植玉蜀黍、向日葵、白菜和其他一些可以储存的饲料作物。
    我们应该特别强调利用像玉蜀黍这种有价值的饲料作物。许多饲畜业发达的国家都广泛地利用玉蜀黍作饲料，这并不是偶然的事。但是在苏联，即使是在最适于种植玉蜀黍的地方，玉蜀黍也只是在极少的地面上种植。
    苏联许多州具备有种玉蜀黍的良好条件。我们可以举出许多事实，说明乌克兰的集体农庄和国营农场的玉蜀黍的单位面积产量很高。早在一九四八年，波尔塔发州的“共产国际”国营农场的农学家塔朗同志利用方形簇种法，使很大一片地区每一公顷土地的玉蜀黍产量达到七吨之多。在第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州的“契卡洛夫”集体农庄（主席是谢尔比娜），五年以来，每公顷的平均产量是五吨。我还没有谈到著名的玉蜀黍种植专家，第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州利霍夫区“红色游击队”集体农庄庄员马尔克·奥泽尔在这方面的卓越成就，他使得玉蜀黍的单位面积产量每年都在增加，在一九四九年达到空前的数字——每公顷产玉蜀黍二十二点四吨。
    莫斯科州的经验说明，种植玉蜀黍，就保证了中央地区青储饲料的丰收。方形簇种法使每一公顷能出产五十吨或更多的青储饲料作物。例如，“新生活之路”集体农庄和莫斯科州的“高尔基—二”国营农场在每一公顷的土地上已出产了七十至八十多吨玉蜀黍作为青储饲料。多数集体农庄即使出产不了七十至八十吨，只要每公顷出产二十五至三十吨鲜玉蜀黍，那就可以从一公顷玉蜀黍得到二百二十五至二百六十公斤牛油。
    有些地方的领导人员抱怨说缺少饲料，而同时却提出减少种植玉蜀黍的面积。我们乌克兰的同志也犯了这种错误。试问：他们能提出有更高产量的饲料谷物吗？
    必须大力采取措施以增加玉蜀黍的产量，并大力扩大贮藏作饲料用的玉蜀黍的种植面积。贮藏作饲料用的玉蜀黍的种植应推广到中央黑土地带和非黑土地带各州及白俄罗斯和波罗的海各共和国。同时，在乌拉尔和西伯利亚的南部地区、远东和哈萨克的北部地区的集体农庄和国营农场，扩大饲畜用玉蜀黍的种植面积也是非常重要的事。
    在增加玉蜀黍、向日葵和其它饲料作物的时候，我们必须确使每一个集体农庄和国营农场建造足能为每头母牛储存五吨到六吨优良饲料的储藏室。
    党机关，特别是在中央黑土地带和非黑土地带的党机关必须克服对种植马铃薯作为饲料不够注意的现象。
    对于自然草场和牧场的利用与改进是不能令人满意的。在一九五二年，集体农庄为每头食用牛和乳牛储存了九百六十公斤的干草，一九四○年的数字是一千一百公斤。有必要大量提高自然草地和人工草地的产量，尽一切可能发展紫花苜蓿、马草、牛草和红豆草的种植。在南部地区，苏丹草地应得到特别的重视，因为这种草地生长大量的质量好的干草。野豌豆和燕麦杂种在北部地区和中部地区生长得很好。
    各集体农庄有必要广泛实行夏季露天牲畜饲养，利用“绿色活动带”（塔斯社编者按：“绿色活动带”系指在一片土地上种植接二连三地在不同时间成熟的作物以连续供给新鲜饲料）作为提高奶类产量的有效措施。
    假如党、苏维埃、农业机关以及所有农业工作者不认真着手在每一个集体农庄和国营农场建立固定的饲料基地的话，饲畜业是不可能向前推进的。但是，还有许多党和苏维埃的工作者认为，生产并储存饲料是次要的问题。某些同志对于每一个集体农庄和国营农场中的这种工作不是给予具体的、日常的指导，而是忽冷忽热地开展一些运动，发表一些满篇诺言的谈话。
    例如，倭罗格达州党委书记西奥明同志对于完成饲料储存方面的任务是这样了解的：他在州党委会全体会议上作报告（这篇报告以后在州报纸上发表了）时说：“我们必须认为，在饲畜业方面，出发点、基本问题并不是饲料基地。首先是领导，然后才是饲料基地。”
    他接着建议以十天到十五天时间的突击来完成割草工作。他说：“只有发动全面突击，这场战斗才能获胜。”他要求“成立许多集体农庄共有的总部或区总部来组织并指导这个工作”。
    请容我们问一问：如果成立这种空想的许多集体农庄共有的总部来指导割草工作，那么，把区党委和区执行委员会置于何处呢，它们要起什么作用呢？倭罗格达州党委和州执行委员会自己放弃了在饲料储存中的领导。结果是，到了八月二十五日，还有十五万九千公顷的天然草场和人种畜草没有收割，饲料储存计划只完成了百分之五十七。
    如果饲料问题不得到解决，牲畜的产品生产率就不能大大提高。
    我们不能再容忍十年多来许多集体农庄的牛奶产量没有超过每头牛一千到一千零七十公斤的现象。这是完全不能容忍的。因为，像“卡拉瓦耶夫”、“高尔基—二”、“林中旷野”、“霍尔摩戈尔卡”这样一些先进的国营农场和像科斯特罗马州
   “十月十二日”、亚尔干日尔州“新生活”这样的先进集体农庄，由于使用了丰足的多汁饲料，几年来已达到了平均每头牛产奶四千五百、五千、六千公斤，甚至更多。
    应当对提高养猪业产品生产率的问题予以严重的注意，应尽力把猪养得更肥，因为养猪业的生产量还没有在我国的肉类供应中占它应有的地位。一九五二年养猪业的总产量共为一百六十万吨，而一九四○年是一百五十万吨。
    增加我国的羊毛生产同样具有巨大的意义。在许多州和区内，羊的剪毛量达到了很高的水平。斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区各集体农庄一九五二年每头羊的细毛剪毛量达五点二公斤。然而，我国的羊毛仍然是不够的。哈萨克共和国的领导干部应当受到严厉的批评。该共和国现在只有一千七百万头绵羊和山羊，而在一九二八年却有一千九百多万头。虽然细毛绵羊的头数已增加为一九四○年的四倍多，但羊毛平均产量却由二点四公斤减少到一点九公斤。因此，哈萨克只能完成羊毛供应计划的百分之六十到七十，这是不足为奇的。
    进一步提高集体农庄饲料生产机械化的水平，对于解决饲料问题具有重要的意义。过去三年中，机器拖拉机站在使饲料收割和保藏机械化方面的工作有了大大的增加，但是机器拖拉机站在饲料生产中的总工作量的水平还是很低，远远落后于谷物生产方面已经达到的机械化水平。
    特别应当注意在短时期内进行干草的收割和堆集工作。拖延这些工作的时间就会使干草量遭到巨大损失。大家知道，干草如果长时间不割下来，或是割下后长时间不把它堆集起来，那么它的最有价值的营养料就会受到损失。因此，让干草拖延不割，我们得到的每公顷干草产量就会大大减少。
    在一九五四—一九五五年内，计划将干草的收割和收集工作的机械化水平提高到百分之八十；干草堆集工作百分之六十五；饲料保藏工作百分之七十五；秣草作物和块根饲料的播种和行间中耕工作百分之九十五。计划大大扩大机器拖拉机站的工作以根本改良草地和牧场。同时必须尽力提高饲畜部费力劳动的机械化水平。
    保证所有牲畜都有牲畜房，是非常重要的，必须通过全苏消费合作社中央联合会的系统和地方合作社与地方国营工业的系统，增加对集体农庄的建筑材料的销售量。应当建议具有适当条件的集体农庄，用自己的力量和资金生产砖、瓦和石灰，以满足它们自己对上述材料的需求。到这里为止，我们已经讨论了公有饲畜业落后的原因和发展的道路。这是我们主要的任务。然而，我们不能忘记集体农庄庄员私有的牲畜。在这一方面的情况也是不能令人满意的。与战前水平相比较，居民私有的母牛的头数减少了六百五十万头。没有母牛的集体农庄农户的数目增为百分之四十五。
    苏联最高苏维埃最近通过的新农业税法，在饲养牲畜方面给了集体农庄庄员以更大的鼓励。
    在发展公有饲畜业的同时，地方党、苏维埃和农业机关必须完全消灭在集体农庄庄员私有牲畜方面违反集体农庄庄员利益的不正确的措施。
    只有不懂得党的政策、不懂得苏维埃国家的政策的人才会认为，集体农庄农户在集体农庄章程所规定的范围内拥有有产品的牲畜意味着对社会主义制度的威胁。同时，也必须消除这样一种偏见，即认为产业工人或机关工作者私有牲畜是件不体面的事。
    建议使集体农庄庄员、产业工人和机关工作者拥有牲畜的措施丝毫不意味着要忽视集体农庄和国营农场的饲畜业的发展。
    发展公有饲畜业曾经是并且仍然是解决饲畜问题的主要方法。到将来，当公有饲畜业发展到能够完全满足集体农民对牲畜产品的需求的水平时，集体农民私人饲养牲畜就没有什么好处了。
    但是，现在我们没有达到这种水平，公有饲畜业还没有能完全满足包括集体农民在内的全体居民对牲畜产品的需求，因此，集体农户自己饲养牲畜对公有饲畜业不但没有妨碍，而且还有帮助，不但对集体农民有利，对集体农庄和国家也同样是有利的。
    因此，为了使饲畜业进一步发展，必须：根本改进对饲畜业发展的领导，挑选固定的优秀干部到牲畜饲养部门去工作；
    提高集体农庄和集体农民在发展公有饲畜业中的经济利益；
    采取必要的措施增加公有牲畜、特别是母牛的头数，提高牲畜的产品生产率，以便在一九五四年就获得重大的成就；
    加强饲畜业的饲料基地，保证所有牲畜都能得到足够的饲料；
    提高饲料生产和牧场中费力工作机械化的水平，为所有的公有牲畜建筑良好的畜房，改善对牲畜的保养和照顾；
    帮助集体农民获得有产品的牲畜。
    同志们！最迅速地发展饲畜业对国家具有非常重要的意义，而且是目前党和国家在农业方面最迫切的任务。我们必须完成重大的和复杂的任务。但是，不管有多大的困难，我们必须在最近两三年内胜利地完成这项工作，迅速提高牲畜产品的产量。
    （三）关于增加马铃薯和蔬菜的产量及交售量
    下一个必须解决的迫切问题是增加马铃薯和蔬菜的产量的问题。对马铃薯和蔬菜的需求量已增加到如此的地步，以致必须承认它们现在的生产水平是十分不够的。最近几年以来这些作物的产量和总收获量不仅没有增加，甚至还减少了。蔬菜的播种面积比一九四○年减少了二十五万公顷。马铃薯的播种面积整个说来在全国增加了，但是在个别的州，却远没有达到战前的水平。在诺夫哥罗德州集体农庄的马铃薯种植面积为战前水平的百分之三十八，维利基鲁基州为百分之五十九，斯摩棱斯克州为百分之六十一。
    但是特别惊人的是许多区的单位面积产量的降低，以致使马铃薯的总收获量减少。
    马铃薯总收获量的减少，和蔬菜生产的不足使我们不能大大改善以这些产品供应城市和工业中心的劳动人民和以原料供应食品工业企业。我前面已经说过，马铃薯的不足也对饲畜业的发展产生了坏的影响。
    既然有着巨大的可能性提高产量，可是集体农庄的马铃薯和蔬菜的生产近来都没有提高，许多区甚至反而减少了，原因究竟在那里呢？
    马铃薯和蔬菜生产落后的原因之一是集体农庄和集体农民在发展这些作物的生产中，没有很大的物质利益。而在其他作物方面，如棉花、甜菜、茶叶和柑橘类水果方面，我们有一整套的物质鼓励制度来增加生产。一直到现在为止，我们在马铃薯和蔬菜方面还没有这种制度。不适当的收购价格，收购机关拟订交售标准的不正确的措施，特别是由于把邻近城市的地区和食品工业地区集体农民的标准提高，以及把先进集体农庄的标准订得较高，便使集体农庄在增加这些作物的产量方面的利益受到了破坏。
    必须纠正这些缺点并给以巨大的物质鼓励。以使集体农庄的马铃薯和蔬菜产量增加。鼓励的方法是提高马铃薯和蔬菜的收购价格，降低义务交售标准，更多地以更高的价格来购买，免除马铃薯和蔬菜栽种比例大的集体农庄交售谷物的义务。
    然而，必须指出，在提高收购价格方面，我们已经做了我们所能做的一切。马铃薯和蔬菜的收购价格不能再增加了。如果我们将来照这样做，在售出马铃薯和蔬菜的时候，就要赔本。这样，不但不能按照党和政府的一贯政策降低马铃薯和蔬菜的零售价格，反而要把零售价格提高，这是和人民利益不符合的。不用说，党和政府不能也不会这样做。
    因此，我们要做的主要是尽力提高这种作物的收获量，这种收获量现在还是很低的。但是，提高它的收获量的可能性是很大的。集体农庄平均每公顷收获一百四十公担到一百五十公担马铃薯，然而有好几百个先进集体农庄每公顷却已收获了二百公担到三百公担。几千个先进农业工作者所得到的成绩更为出色。乌克兰集体农庄女庄员马尔塔·胡多丽每公顷收获了八百公担马铃薯；莫斯科州的集体农庄女庄员迪阿诺娃同志和科茹汉泽娃同志每公顷收获了五百多公担马铃薯。
    如果我们明年能够把所有集体农庄的马铃薯收获量提高，甚至提高到集体农庄的平均收获量的水平，那末，这项任务就充分实现，那末，马铃薯的生产将大大提高。由此可以看出，增加由马铃薯和蔬菜得到的收入的主要来源是提高收获量。要达到这个目的，首先要保证马铃薯和蔬菜的播种、中耕和收获工作的全面机械化。种植和收获谷类作物的主要工作差不多已完全机械了，而去年集体农庄种植马铃薯的工作仅仅机械化了百分之十四，收获马铃薯工作的机械化程度还不到百分之六。
    马铃薯种植机械化的问题，主要是它的种植方法的问题。如果我们不能用比较先进的使行间中耕完全机械化的方法来种植马铃薯和蔬菜，我们就不能解决机械化的问题。这种方法是否已在我国应用了呢？是的，已经应用了，这就是方形簇种法。先进的集体农庄早就采用这种方法了。莫斯科州谢尔普霍夫区斯大林集体农庄早在一九四三年就开始用方形簇种法来种植马铃薯了。近年来许多认识到这
  一方法的优越性的集体农庄都已开始广泛地采用它了。例如，在今年春天，莫斯科州的马铃薯大部分都是用这种方法种植的。新方法的好处究竟在什么地方呢？它的好处就在于：它可以使中耕工作无论是横行或纵行都能机械化，在照料幼苗工作中可以大大减轻人力劳动。此外，它可以为植物的发展、从而为取得丰收创造最好的条件。
    我举几个例子来说：莫斯科州拉孟斯克区的
  “走向共产主义之路”集体农庄共有九百二十公顷耕地。中耕作物占其中的四百六十公顷，其中包括二百七十七公顷的马铃薯和一百二十公顷的蔬菜。农庄中有三百二十一个有劳动力的庄员，其中有一百六十个从事田地工作。因此，一个从事田地工作的庄员需要照顾约三公顷中耕作物。难道一个农庄庄员能够借马的力量和人力管理得了这样大一块田地，还能获得丰收吗？显然是不可能的。在一九五一年集体农庄庄员们开始采用方形簇种法播种马铃薯时，供方形簇种用的机器还没有出现。这些机器还在试验中。他们决定用中耕机。集体农庄庄员们的判断是正确的；就是，即使是用手工工作，而没有机器，也应该用方形簇种法来种植。宁可多费一点劳动在种植方面，也要为机械化的操作创造条件。
  一切操作机械化之后，该集体农庄的收获量就急剧地上升了。一九五二年，用方形簇种法种植的马铃薯每公顷可收一百六十七公担，而用普通方法种植的马铃薯每公顷只收到八十公担。
    今年这一集体农庄中，几乎全部田地上都是用方形簇种法种植马铃薯的。在集体农庄中，用方形簇种法种植四行马铃薯的工作只用一个人日，而拖拉机在一公顷马铃薯地上进行三个来回的中耕工作只要○·六个人日。这一来，用方形簇种法时，每公顷马铃薯的种植和中耕工作只要一·六个人日；如果要换普通的种植方法，这些工作就需要三十多个人日。在用方形簇种法时，用在种植马铃薯的一个人日可以使集体农庄每公顷获得二十三公担的马铃薯，而用普通方法只能获得一公担半的马铃薯。只要很好地掌握了种植马铃薯的机器，劳动生产率就会更加提高。这就需要能够胜任的工作人员。我们国家的人民正在发展。我们已有了相当多的已掌握了技术和正在获得卓越的成绩的机器操使者。在莫斯科州拉孟斯克区“走向共产主义之路”集体农庄，机器操使者阿基姆斐耶夫同志操使一部四行马铃薯种植机打破了每天八公顷的定额，每天种植十二点四公顷。假使我们记住一部机器上有八个人工作，我们就可以看出每个人日能种植一公顷半马铃薯！莫斯科州布朗尼茨基区“伏罗希洛夫”集体农庄的机器操使者列德金同志在一个工作班的工作时间中操使一部四行种植机可以种十到十一公顷的马铃薯。这些就是方形簇种法的好处！我们的任务就是要把这种方法广泛地利用到生产方面去。
    必须指出，苏联农业和农业储存部的负责人员在这件事情上采取了一种不正确的态度。他们的计划要求在种植机器允许的情况之下尽量利用方形簇种法种植马铃薯。而我们现在所有的机器还少，如果根据农业和农业储存部的计划，只有一半土地才能利用新方法耕种了。我们不能同意这一点。应该指出，方形簇种法是当我们还没有专用机器的时候已在集体农庄中创始。而它在先进的集体农庄中应用得十分有效。明年我们必须普遍利用方形簇种法种植马铃薯。工业方面正在努力增加马铃薯种植机的产量，但是它们还会不敷应用的。种植马铃薯将必须利用中耕机或犁，但是一定要应用方形簇种法。如果我们做到这一点，从而使马铃薯的中耕工作机械化，我们可以肯定，马铃薯的产量明年一定会大大地提高。
    大家都知道，以中耕机和犁来实行方形簇种法时，栽种马铃薯的工作是靠手来做的。这样就可以把粪肥和块茎一同种入坑中，这对增加单位面积产量是非常重要的。在同一个“走向共产主义之路”集体农庄（拉孟斯克区）中，在沙地上用中耕机栽种时，在每个坑中放进了半公斤粪肥和矿质肥料的混合物。在收获时，每公顷收获了十五点六吨马铃薯。把肥料放进坑中去的方法可以使肥料使用得更加有效。本来，要获得这样的收成，必需在土壤上大约用三十吨到四十吨粪肥，然而，把肥料放进坑中就只要十吨。任何集体农庄或国营农场都可以采用方形簇种法用中耕机或犁来栽种马铃薯，同时把粪肥和矿质肥料放进坑中。一切都取决于领导，取决于对新方法的重要性的领会和组织这件工作的坚毅和技巧，即是说，正确地配备人力，指定田地来栽种作物和布置其他工作。
    关于种子方面，也必须谈一谈。俗语说得好：
  “不望坏籽出良种”。可惜得很，我们轻视了做种用的马铃薯，这种轻视的态度在有些时候甚至达到了罪恶的程度。许多集体农庄和国营农场使用不良的种子，并且还不够标准。然而，用够标准的马铃薯是得到丰收的特别重要而且常常是决定性的条件。例如，莫斯科州先进的集体农庄每公顷种下两三吨。在好好地培养后，它们每公顷收到了二十到二十五吨马铃薯。不幸的是，大多数集体农庄在领导者们的默许下，每公顷只种植了一吨或者一吨半马铃薯。当然，有着这样的一个标准和利用不良的和小的种子尤其是马马虎虎地中耕，马铃薯的丰收就没有希望了。
    不能容许事情这样继续下去了。容许这种标准之下的种植就是故意地要使集体农庄歉收，这种工作人员一定要加以严惩。每一个集体农庄必须有它的做种用马铃薯，在九月间就必须把它们贮藏起来，决不能迟于九月，它们必须是从丰收的作物中选出来的。那时候，马铃薯是干燥的，而且会保得很好。做种用的马铃薯的储藏工作一直迟到收获的最后几天，而收割要挨到十月底，有时要到十一月。潮泾时期到来了，早霜已降，而集体农庄还没有贮藏起它的种子。因此马铃薯经常受到霜的侵袭，并没有完全干就被贮藏起来了。
    在春天一打开坑的时候，一半的马铃薯已坏了。如果每一个集体农庄和国营农场的做种用马铃薯在九月就贮藏好而且我们必须坚决地这样做，那末，我们将有足够的做种用马铃薯。种植早熟马铃薯品种的面积必须大大扩大，至于南部各州，必须更加注意用李森科院士的方法进行马铃薯的夏季种植。
    同志们！马铃薯对国民经济有重大的意义。马铃薯不但可以作食物而且也可以作制造酒精、淀粉等的原料。如以同样的面积来种植马铃薯和谷物，从马铃薯获得到的酒精就为从谷物获得的酒精的四倍。马铃薯是牲畜，主要是猪、乳牛以及家禽的一种很好的饲料。
    德·纳·普里扬尼索科夫院士的材料证明，生产一普特的猪肉，大约需要十普特马铃薯。如果每公顷种植十五吨马铃薯，然后再加一小部分谷物拿来喂猪，那末就有可能使猪肉增加九十普特。如果适当地用马铃薯来饲养母牛，结果一定可以生产更多的牛奶和牛油。
    增加马铃薯产量的任务正成为更进一步发展农业的主要任务之一。假如我们有足够的马铃薯，我们就能够在以后的两年中大大增加猪肉、牛奶和牛油的产量。中央非黑土地带在生产马铃薯和蔬菜的工作中所起的作用应该特别加以叙述。我记得莫斯科、列宁格勒、利森、图拉和其他几州以及白俄罗斯、拉脱维亚、立陶宛和爱沙尼亚共和国的条件很适于大量种植马铃薯。不幸，这些州只生产很少的马铃薯和蔬菜。
    直到现在，农业机关种植蔬菜的计划还是不正确的。如果一个区被摊派一百公顷土地种植白菜，于是，它一定会把这一定额平均分摊给区里面所有的集体农庄。种植黄瓜、番茄和其他菜蔬的情况也是这样。从经济的观点来看这一原则是完全错误的。蔬菜的种植需要特别的条件和特别的土壤。多数蔬菜，特别是白菜，在潮湿的低地上可以有大得多的产量。可是，我们的办法却是对处于近水的河滩地的集体农庄和没有这种土壤条件的集体农庄分派同样的定额。集体农庄不得不在不适宜的土地上种植白菜和其他蔬菜。虽然这些集体农庄在这上面花费了很多劳力和金钱，所得的收获还是很少。
    那么，关于蔬菜种植的分配应该做些什么呢？这个问题最好的解决应该是，将蔬菜的种植集中在土壤最适于种植蔬菜的地区。这就是莫斯科州的党组织和苏维埃组织已经采取的道路，它们曾提出“关于作物集中以及集体农庄蔬菜种植机械化”的决议草案供政府考虑。莫斯科州提出的建议得到政府的考虑与批准。现在，该州集体农庄中的蔬菜种植，首先是白菜的种植，将集中在最适于这个目的的土地上——河滩地。
    以前在莫斯科州，有一千三百七十三个集体农庄种植蔬菜，今天供给市场的蔬菜的种植主要将集中于二百五十二个集体农庄，其中一百四十一个座落在河滩地带。莫斯科河、奥卡河、雅赫罗马河、克利亚兹马河流域河滩地带的蔬菜种植面积将自一九五二年的六千公顷增加到一九五四年的一万二千公顷。由于蔬菜的集中种植，产量增加，莫斯科州应该实际上充分满足莫斯科城以及该州其它城市对白菜、胡萝卜和食用甜菜的需要，相当程度地满足对于番茄和黄瓜的需要。
    为解决其他各州、各边疆区、各共和国的蔬菜集中种植问题，应该效法莫斯科人的榜样。
    行间耕耘的机械化对增加蔬菜的产量具有特别重要的意义。必须认为这种情形是不正常的：直至现在，大部分集体农庄的蔬菜种植基本上还是用手工进行的。有一些蔬菜的播种为什么不采用方形簇种法呢？向部的领导人提出这个问题时，他们回答说：没有方形簇种的机器。但这个理由是站不住脚的！因为白菜和番茄现在也还是照例是用手工种植，因此，改用方形簇种法种植，是不用多花劳动力的。即令这种种植的方法要稍微多花一些劳动力，集体农庄在以后的工作中仍能得到补偿的。用方形簇种法种植，我们就有可能用拖拉机使行间耕作机械化，如果没有拖拉机曳引的工具，也可用马拉中耕机。及时的耕耘对收成一定有利。因此，一九五四年春季应当用方形簇种法种植白菜、番茄和茄子。应当用方形簇种法种植黄瓜、瓢瓜、南瓜和西瓜。
    提高蔬菜收获量的重要方法之一就是用在泥炭腐植容器内培育菜秧的方法。这一有价值的建议是二十余年前由艾德斯坦教授提出来的。可惜农业机关差不多没有设法推广在泥炭腐植容器内培育菜秧的方法。在采用了这种方法的地方都获得了惊人的成果。莫斯科州米吉兴区的“纪念伊里奇”集体农庄自从在泥炭腐植容器内培育菜秧后，十三年中平均早熟的白菜的收获量是每公顷四百四十七公担。集体农民们由于采用了在泥炭腐植容器内培育菜秧的方法，使每公顷白菜收获量增加了一百公担。莫斯科附近有一个高尔基国营农场，农学家费拉托夫同志就在那里工作。他是一个十分热心于自己工作的人。他采用了在泥炭腐植容器内培育菜秧的方法之后，使早熟蔬菜丰收，每公顷获利优厚。一九五三年从六月二十五日起该国营农场就开始收获早熟白菜并交给国家，而花椰菜从六月十一日起开始收获并交给国家。早熟白菜每公顷平均收获量是二百九十八公担，花椰菜是二百四十一公担。每公顷早熟白菜的收入为六万五千卢布，每公顷花椰菜的收入为八万两千卢布。该国营农场一九五二年在八月一日以前共交给国家七百三十三万四千卢布价值的早熟蔬菜，一九五三年的同时期内共交了一千一百一十五万四千卢布价值的早熟蔬菜。这就是这一新的提高蔬菜收获量的好方法的效果。现在的问题是：要组织每个生产蔬菜的国营农场和集体农庄用泥炭腐植容器培育菜秧。
    现在各集体农庄和国营农场极少种植像茄子、胡椒、瓢瓜、番茄、绿豆这一类的有价值的蔬菜。这就限制了食品工业的罐头生产。现在的任务是：在最近一两年中扩大这类蔬菜的播种和提高其收获量。在适宜种西瓜和香瓜的地区应该多种西瓜和香瓜。
    最后是关于温室和温床的问题。如果不建立很好的温床温室，我们的蔬菜业就不可能提高。根据大概的估计，集体农庄仅是在培养菜秧方面就需要一千四百万个温床架，而各集体农庄今年一共只有温床架五百万个左右。只到现在还没有组织对各集体农庄供应温床架的工作。现在出售的温床架的价格太高。发展温床问题应该立即解决。
    凡是有可能的地方，都应当尽力利用工业企业的废弃热力。种蔬菜的集体农庄常常没有足够的生物发酵热能用来给温床、土壤加热，也没有足够的煤和柴用来给温室加热。然而，几乎是不要花钱的工业废弃热力（蒸气、热水）被利用得相当少。某些集体农庄的实际情况表明：这些燃料来源是可以有成效地用来给温室、温床加热的。
    莫斯科州乌赫托马区的“第三个五年计划”集体农庄就正在使用工业废弃热力。一九五二年，该集体农庄庄员建筑了面积达一千零八十平方公尺的温室，利用该农庄附近一个工厂的废弃蒸汽为温室加热。可惜这种例子太少了。顿巴斯、列宁格勒、高尔基、斯维德洛夫及其他城市的工业企业废弃热力没有加以利用，虽然在这方面有着巨大的可能。
    必须建议集体农庄和国营农场广泛地使用蒸汽和电力为温床加热，这样就可以减轻集体农民的劳动，提高蔬菜的收获量。例如，莫斯克沃列茨基区的“纪念伊里奇”集体农庄从一九五二年起开始用蒸汽为温床加热。今年，该农庄有一千二百个用蒸汽加热的温床架。今年八月一日，该集体农庄平均每一个温床得到的收获量为：用蒸汽加热的温床二十八公斤蔬菜；用生物发酵方法加热的温床十九公斤蔬菜。以在温床上培植蔬菜所花费的劳动日来计算，则每一劳动日所得收获量为：用蒸汽加热的温床二十六公斤蔬菜，用生物发酵方法加热的温床十五公斤蔬菜。该农庄在一九五三年每公顷收获四百八十五公担白菜，二百六十公担番茄。该农庄每公顷菜地的蔬菜现金收入达五万六千卢布。该集体农庄一九五二年每一劳动日的报酬仅现金一项就达二十二卢布七十六戈比。
    由此可见，要增加马铃薯和蔬菜的生产，必须：提高集体农庄和集体农民在种植这些作物方面的物质利益；使马铃薯、蔬菜的栽种、行间耕种机械化，广泛地采用方形簇种法；调整蔬菜种植地区，把蔬菜集中栽种在河滩地、洼地和低地；尽量增加粪肥和其他当地肥料的积存，增加泥炭肥料，以使马铃薯和蔬菜栽种在肥料充足的土地；增加温床和温室，利用泥炭腐植容器培植菜秧。
    增加马铃薯和蔬菜的生产的任务是艰巨的。必须在最短的期间内使这些作物的生产能够充分满足我国居民的需求。这个任务我们是能胜任的。这个任务应当解决而且一定可以解决。
    （四）关于提高谷物和工业作物的单位面积产量
    要克服饲畜业发展和马铃薯、蔬菜生产中的落后状态，我们必须保证今后更加迅速地提高谷物的产量。这不仅是为了满足居民对粮食的日益增长的需求，而且是为了迅速提高一切农业部门、首先是饲畜业。
    谷物生产比其他一些农业部门的成绩大得多。我们不仅在比较短的时期内恢复了遭受战争创伤的谷物生产，而且把它扩大了。像小麦这样有价值的粮食的播种面积迅速地扩大着。现在小麦播种面积比战前大八百一十万公顷。乌克兰、北高加索和克里米亚发展谷物生产的成绩很大。这些地方的小麦播种面积恢复了，而且扩大了，而冬麦的播种面积增加的特别多，它的单位面积产量提高了。
    许多集体农庄和整个整个的区每公顷收到一百五十至二百普特的小麦。楚瓦西自治共和国伏尔纳区斯大林集体农庄每公顷收二百一十二普特春麦。尼古拉耶夫州巴希坦区的集体农庄一九五二年全部冬小麦播种面积的产量为每公顷一百七十普特。
    这是很大的成绩。但是相当大一部分集体农庄和国营农场的谷物、特别是豆科作物的单位面积产量仍然低。在这方面落后的有非黑土带地区、中央黑土地带各州、伏尔加河流域、西伯利亚西部和哈萨克各区。
    集体农庄和国营农场有很大的可能性来使小麦、裸麦、大麦、燕麦及其他谷物的生产量一年比
  一年提高。
    必须特别注意小麦。为了提高冬小麦和春小麦的生产，除了原来种植这些作物的地区以外，中央黑土带各州、伏尔加河流域、乌克兰森林草原的许多地区以及非黑土带的一些地区有着广泛的可能性。只要遵守一切必要的农学技术条件，这些地区的冬小麦和春小麦是可以有很高的单位面积产量的。
    必须坚决克服谷类饲料作物生产落后的现象，这种作物的单位面积产量仍然是很低的。
    我们的谷类饲料作物的播种面积不够，单位面积产量很低。因此，荞麦和粟的储存量大大减低了。荞麦的重要是大家都知道的。然而对种植这种作物抱的是什么态度呢？照例是不及时播种，把它种在坏地上，土地耕耘得不好，不进行辅助受粉，不养蜂等等。没有真正努力提高粟的收获量，宽行播种法几乎没有采用，即使有的地方采用，也不经常进行行间耕耘。用宽行播种法播种的粟和其他作物，如果不进行中耕，也不会有很高的单位面积产量。同时必须指出，我们对谷类饲料作物的生产鼓励得不够。在收购的时候，四十磅粟折合三十四磅小麦或四十磅裸麦，因而不能提高集体农民对种植粟的兴趣。必须确定这些作物的正确折合价格。我们有可能在南部、南高加索、中亚细亚、南哈萨克和远东各州、各共和国增加大米的生产量。
    另一个严重的缺点是：许多集体农庄对谷物种植实际上没有采用奖金制度这种有力的鼓励办法。得到奖金的收获量标准定得太高，以致许多集体农庄的农民得不到这项奖金。现在已经有必要修改发给奖金的办法了。
    我们也不要忘记小米。必须继续为这种谷物而努力。选出单位面积产量很高的品种，并在试验站和集体农庄、国营农场加以试验。为了保证全国居民获得多种食品，必须全力增加豆科作物——豌豆、豇豆、扁豆、黄豆的生产。
    战后集体农庄含油植物的播种面积已经大大增加，并已超过战前水平。向日葵的产量有大大提高的可能。可惜它的产量却很低。有许多集体农庄和整个整个的区对向日葵照顾得很好，单位面积产量很高。譬如斯大林州的马里耶区就是这样，那里的集体农庄每公顷可收十八公担以上的向日葵子。
    如果我们改用方形簇种法来播种这种作物，那就可以使耕作机械化，质量优良地、及时地进行耕作，并大大地提高向日葵的单位面积产量。这样，我们就可以满足全国对植物油的需要。
    除向日葵外，还必须尽力增加榨油用亚麻、蓖麻子、花生、芥子、亚麻荠和其他含油作物的生产。
    我们在植棉业发展方面取得了很大的成绩。今年在受灌溉田地播种的棉花的面积超过一九四○年的面积三十一万七千公顷。一九五二年，在各灌溉区的原棉收获量每公顷超过战前六公担。去年生产的棉花比一九四○年多百分之七十。有数百个集体农庄每公顷平均收到三十到四十公担的原棉，而有许多工作队和工作组每公顷则收到五十公担和五十公担以上的原棉。
    今后必须进一步扩大这一最有价值的作物的生产。种植棉花的共和国在这方面还有大量的未被利用的潜力。如果考虑到，去年三分之一的植棉的集体农庄每公顷所收的原棉不到十五公担的话，那就很明白，这些集体农庄的收获量至少也可以提高到每公顷二十到二十五公担。这项任务首先是摆在哈萨克的植棉集体农庄的面前，这些集体农庄的棉花单位面积产量直到现在还是很低的：平均每公顷十一到十二公担。在吉尔吉斯共和国，土库曼共和国的塔萨乌兹州，卡拉·卡尔巴克自治共和国中棉花生产提高得很慢。乌兹别克共和国花剌子模州和萨马尔坎德州有大量增加棉产量的潜能还没有发挥。
    恢复和开发未被利用的灌溉田地的工作做得不好，这就阻碍着植棉业的进一步发展。改良土壤的工作做得不能令人满意。必须在最短期间保证大量提高棉花产量，并充分满足轻工业对这一有价值原料的需要。
    甜菜的生产获得了重大的成就。甜菜的播种面积一九五三年比一九四○年增加了百分之二十八，甜菜的单位面积产量也增加了。国内食糖的生产早在一九五○年就超过了战前的水平，而且从这时候起不断地增加着。但是，居民对糖的需求仍超过它的产量。
    我们的任务在于：到五年计划结束时，使甜菜的生产增加百分之六十五到百分之七十。使甜菜每年的总收获量由一九五二年的二亿二千万公担增加到三亿五千万公担左右。方法是：扩大主要甜菜种植区的播种面积、把甜菜移植到新的地区，更主要是增加它的单位面积产量和总收获量。
    库尔斯克和哈尔科夫这两个州的比较材料雄辩地说明了：一方面，我们有着这样大的增加甜菜收获量的潜力，而另一方面，由于农业技术的低劣，集体农庄和国家遭到了巨大的损失。这两个州彼此为邻，而且是在同一的条件下发展农业的。但是它们的结果多么不同。
    它们每一公顷的甜菜交售给国家的公担数目是：
    一九四○　一九五○　一九五一　一九五二
    库尔斯克州　九二　九四　一三九　九六
    哈尔科夫州　一八三　一九○　二一三　一八五
    一九五二年，库尔斯克州集体农庄种植了十三万一千公顷甜菜，而哈尔科夫州集体农庄少一半，只种植了六万二千公顷甜菜。而这两个州交售给制糖工厂的甜菜数量几乎是相等的：库尔斯克州是一千二百六十万公担，而哈尔科夫州是一千一百五十万公担。发生这种现象的原因主要是由于农业技术水平不同。
    下面就是说明一九五二年主要田间工作所花时间的材料：
    库尔斯克州  哈尔科夫州
    播　种　二○天　一○天

    哈尔科夫州对甜菜种的照顾远胜过库尔斯克州。这些材料说明着库尔斯克州对农业的领导不能令人满意。
    像长纤维亚麻、大麻这样一些工业作物也需要予以注意。近几年来，我们已为发展这些作物创造了有利的条件。许多完成和超额完成亚麻和大麻交售计划的集体农庄从这些作物上得到了高额的收入，每公顷亚麻和大麻耕地得到了一万以至更多卢布的收入。尽管政府在战后时期给予了那些栽种亚麻和大麻地区的机器拖拉机站和集体农庄以巨大的帮助，这些作物的生产仍然是处于极端不能令人满意的状态。在许多州、边疆区和共和国内，对增加长纤维亚麻和大麻生产采取漠不关心的态度。这些作物的耕种面积不但没有恢复到战前的水平，而且，和一九五○年相比，过去三年中的耕种面积减少了许多。这些作物的单位面积产量和商品产量仍然是很低的。很少注意保证集体农庄得到自己的长纤维亚麻种子。
    在恢复和发展亚麻生产方面情况特别坏的有：斯摩棱斯克、伊凡诺佛、科斯特罗马、基洛夫、维利基鲁基、布利安斯克、第乌门等州，及阿尔泰、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区；在发展大麻生产方面特别坏的有：巴什基尔和摩尔多夫自治共和国，奥尔洛夫、坦波夫和高尔基州，以及白俄罗斯加盟共和国。
    阻碍亚麻和大麻生产发展的主要原因之一，是这些作物的耕种、收割、特别是头耕方面的劳动机械化处于落后状态。
    每一个集体农庄不得不花费许多劳动来铺麻、沤麻及把亚麻从地上收拾起来。由于劳动力的不足，由于机械化的落后，集体农庄不能及时进行这些工作，并使亚麻遭到巨大的损失。农业机关必须认真着手进行一切亚麻生产操作机械化的工作。新西伯利亚州亚麻加工的经验是值得重视的。去年，该州的马斯利亚宁诺和波洛特诺两区的十个集体农庄，试验直接从耕地上把亚麻送到亚麻工厂。亚麻的脱粒和加工是由工厂进行的。结果，这几个农庄的纤维商品生产量增加到三倍至三倍半，亚麻子增加到二倍至四倍。
    苏联农业和农业储存部和苏联日用品工业部，必须研究这个经验并注意使这个经验得到广泛应用。必须这样来组织这个工作：各集体农庄应把未脱粒亚麻交给亚麻工厂，亚麻工厂再组织抽麻、清除种子、沤麻和亚麻秆的加工。大麻工厂必须准备接收大麻秆。在各亚麻工厂和大麻工厂内必须为亚麻和大麻干茎的加工开始建筑机械化的车间，并且还要建筑机械化的亚麻脱粒车间。
    进一步扩大烟草，下等烟草，茶叶，水果，葡萄，柑橘类水果和其他作物的生产是各集体农庄和国营农场的重要任务。
    提高单位面积产量是农业中的主要任务。在这方面必须要采取一些重要的和迫切的措施。
    耕作的效率必须彻底提高。在许多集体农庄和国营农场中的作物轮种制的采用，特别是在掌握作物轮种制方面组织得不好。这种现象的主要原因是由于忽视牧草种子的培育工作。集体农庄和国营农场培育多年生牧草种子的工作必须坚决地予以改进，它们的单位面积产量必须提高，种植牧草的任务不但必须在今后两三年内完成，而且必须要建立必要数量的储备。必须采取措施使每一个集体农庄和国营农场在多年生和一年生牧草种子方面能够自给自足。同时，我们必须考虑到组织商品种子的培育，首先要在那些能得到很高牧草种子产量的地区培育。
    我们必须多种植作肥料用的羽扇豆。在北部各区为培育种子而种植的羽扇豆经常不能成熟。因此占颇大面积的北部各区的集体农庄，以前一向在羽扇豆种子方面不能自给自足。必须决定在那些地区应该组织羽扇豆种子的商品生产。
    提高单位面积产量的一个重要因素是及时地犁耕休耕地和秋耕地，并在最适宜的时间播种作物。一些地区冬季作物的单位面积产量之所以低，是因为：这些冬季作物种植得很晚，而且是种在没有及时好好耕耘过的、施肥不足的休耕地上，或者是种植在前一年没有休耕过的新犁的土地上。在非黑土地带，许多集体农庄把冬季播种工作拖到九月下半月，而有些集体农庄甚至把播种工作拖到十月的情况，再不能任其存在。非常清楚，不遵循农业技术的方法就会造成冬季作物的巨大损失。
    许多地区春季作物单位面积产量低的原因之一是：直到现在为止，春季作物种植得很晚，而且是种植在春天才犁的和中耕得不好的土壤上。在一九五一年，集体农庄有百分之三十八的春季作物种植在春天才犁的土地上；一九五二年有百分之三十三；一九五三年有百分之四十一；而一九五三年，像斯摩棱斯克、普斯科夫、诺夫哥罗德、维利基鲁基、倭罗格达和科斯特罗马等州，有百分之八十到百分之九十的春季作物种植在春天才犁的土地上。这样地种植作物，自然难以得到很高的单位面积产量。这样的情况再不能使其继续存在下去。在今年秋天，必须要把明年春天要播种的全部土地犁好。
    种子问题也应该十分重视。许多集体农庄和国营农场很不关心他们自己的种子，他们每年从国家贷得巨额的种子。许多时间、劳力、金钱和运输工具白白用在谷物种子的运输上。今年春天，单是在中央各州的集体农庄就贷到五十多万吨的谷物种子，约占它们所需要的种子的百分之三十。三千多万卢布的国家经费（其中尚不包括集体农庄的费用）已花在这批种子的运输和清选工作上。这里还有另外一点值得我们注意。贷来的种子往往不适宜于播种地区的土壤和特有的气候条件。在这种情况之下，自然，不能希望得到很高的单位面积产量。
    现在是整顿培育种子的工作的时候了。在一九五四—一九五五年，必须要转变到使各种作物都播种优良种子。今年，政府建立了各集体农庄和国营农场储备种子的新制度。储备种子的工作必须在最合宜的时候，把精选的优良种子贮藏起来，首先要从按照农业技术播种标准耕作的种子地段上的收获物中储备种子。在向国家交售谷物的计划还未完成以前，如果种子地段没有足够良种的话，就必须把具有最高的单位面积产量的一般作物地段的最好的谷物储藏起来。目前已创造了各种条件，使集体农庄和国营农场能充分地为自己准备单位面积产量很高的品种的最好种子。减低每公顷播种标准的粗暴办法必须坚决地加以纠正。
    最近几年来，农业机关工作者，集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的许多负责人员在使用本地肥料方面的不正确的态度必须加以指责，并认为这是一种严重的缺点。对于这个问题的意义，估计过低，是有害的。否则就不可能解释储聚粪肥和开采泥炭的计划为什么没有完成。
    大家知道，粪肥是一种很有价值的肥料。到这个五年计划结束时，我们大约每年能有四亿吨粪肥，这个数目差不多相当于二千万吨的矿质肥料，或者相当于目前工业生产的肥料的三点五倍。对于粪肥的收集、适当储存和使用必须予以密切的注意。必须消灭不适当地保藏粪肥的现象，因为不适当地保藏粪肥会使它受到气候的影响，结果损失许多有价值的财产。每个集体农庄和国营农场的牲畜饲养部必须建筑粪肥储藏室。粪肥必须全部及时地运往田间并且把它犁到土壤中去。还必须采取措施使装卸粪肥和撒播粪肥这样的费力工作机械化，组织制造粪肥撒播机和粪肥装载器的事宜，并在集体农庄和国营农场的田间使用这些机器。
    在白色灰状酸性土壤地区施用石灰，和在碱性土壤地区施用石膏一样，对于提高作物单位面积产量具有重大的意义。因此，必须在建筑材料工业企业、地方工业企业和生产合作社的企业中大大增加石灰的产量并组织石膏的开采和捣碎工作和把它输送到集体农庄。
    在使用本地肥料以提高单位面积产量的同时，必须大大扩充矿质肥料的生产。政府计划要增加矿质肥料的产量。今年，集体农庄和国营农场将从工业方面得到六百万吨矿质肥料，这差不多为农业方面在一九四○年得到的数量的两倍。以后几年，肥料的生产将大大增加。矿质肥料的贮藏工作将加以整顿并应使矿质肥料得到好好地利用。也必须大规模地使用细菌肥料。
    上述措施的执行将提高耕作的效率并大大提高一切作物的单位面积产量。
    （五）改进机器拖拉机站的工作
    机器拖拉机站在进一步发展农业的工作中起着主要的和决定性的作用。机器拖拉机站现在共有九十六万九千部拖拉机（按十五匹马力计算），比战前增加了百分之七十四；二十五万五千部谷物收割联合机，比一九四○年增加了百分之六十六；还有许多别的机器。
    在战后几年中，机器拖拉机站得到了许多新机器。在战前，拖拉机多半是轮转式的；而在战后则供应了许多柴油引擎履带式拖拉机。它们的数目已增为一九四○年的十四倍。新式的耕作用拖拉机已经创造出来——贝拉鲁斯式、КДП—三五式和霍茨—七式；吊挂式机器和工具的制造已经组织起来。摘棉机、甜菜联合机和其他机器的制造数目正在一天天增加。
    每年，集体农庄生产的机械化程度都在增加，使用手工劳动越来越减少，集体农民的劳动生产率正在不断提高。这说明，农业各部门的进一步发展首先有赖于机器拖拉机站工作的改进。
    不幸的是，有许多党、苏维埃和农业机关的工作人员还不了解，机械化是我们要保持发展的速率和生产的巨大规模不可或缺的条件。许多党、苏维埃和农业机关对机器拖拉机站的指导工作做得不好，它们没有进行适当的监督，以便及时地、很好地完成农业工作，它们没有适当地选择和训练机器拖拉机站工作人员。机器拖拉机站工作中的主要缺点，就是对设备的利用完全不能令人满意。这就是许多非常重要的农业部门之所以落在后面的主要原因。
    必须从根本上改变对机器拖拉机站的态度，必须坚决地消除它们工作中的严重缺点，并实行农业工作的全面机械化。
    机器拖拉机站的主要任务就是尽力提高集体农庄一切农作物的单位面积产量，保证增加公有牲畜的头数，同时并提高它的产品生产率，增加他们所服务的集体农庄的农产品和牲畜产品总产量及商品产量。机器拖拉机站必须完成谷物和技术作物种植工作的机械化，在饲畜业以及马铃薯和蔬菜的生产中实行费力劳动的机械化，把科学的成就和最先进的经验运用到集体农庄生产中去，并且保证在组织上和经济上进一步巩固集体农庄，在这种基础上提高集体农民的物质福利。
    机器拖拉机站必须保证它们所耕作的全部地区获得很高的单位面积产量。假如拖拉机和其他机器都被有效地使用，假如农业工作作得很好，并且在极短的时间内做好的话，这种目标是可以达到的。但是许多机器拖拉机站却没有执行这个极为重要的任务。他们不遵守已确定的农业技术方法，拖延工作期限，土壤翻得很坏，作物播种得不好，这势必使收成减少。去年，有半数以上的机器拖拉机站没有完成它们的计划。在播种春季和冬季作物的一切工作中，有百分之二十以上的工作没有及时进行。像休耕地的中耕、秋耕、割草和饲料储存这样的重要工作也进行得很坏。在收割工作中有大量损失。所以如此，是因为有相当大数目的拖拉机和其它机器在田间工作中没有出动。在一九五二年，只有百分之三十四的拖拉机手完成他们的每班生产定额。在新西伯利亚州、加里宁州、斯摩棱斯克州、雅罗斯拉夫州、维利基鲁基州、普斯科夫州、诺夫哥罗德州和白俄罗斯共和国等地的机器拖拉机站，使用拖拉机的组织工作做得特别坏。
    这种情况的主要原因之一是，机器拖拉机站没有熟练的机器操使者。机器拖拉机站的复杂装备需要熟练技工。但是这些装备却由集体农庄指派来做临时田间工作的季节性工人来管理。拖拉机手实际上不受机器拖拉机站站长的管辖。他高兴就上班，他要是不上班，站长很难对他有什么办法。今天他操纵一部拖拉机，明天他就可能回到集体农庄，或是到工业中去工作。这在相当大的程度上说明了为什么劳动纪律松弛，人员变动很大。每年有百分之三十到三十五的拖拉机手脱离拖拉机队，在许多拖拉机队里，拖拉机曳引机器的操使者每年会变动几次。假如我们要决定性地改进机器拖拉机站的工作，就一定要使能够胜任的机器操使者成为固定的人员，他们必须能够最充分而有成效地利用设备，并能保证使集体农庄的各部门更进一步发展。
    所以，必须使机器拖拉机站的拖拉机手、拖拉机队队长和他们的助手、挖掘机操使者和他们的助手、保持纪录的装燃料工人都成为固定人员，并列入机器拖拉机站的编制。他们应学会各种行业在农闲的时候被雇用于修理厂，从事集体农庄饲畜业的机械化工作和机器拖拉机站的其他工作。拖拉机曳引的农业机器和掘泥机器的操使者以及联合机助理操使者都应作为季节性工人而列入机器拖拉机站的编制。
    必须提高拖拉机队工人的个人物质利益，以便使他们最有效地利用机器和提高单位面积产量。
    以劳动日单位和按件计算办法决定拖拉机队工作人员报酬的工资制度，已在实践中证明其优点；根据这种制度，工作人员按照他们完成的生产定额获得工资报酬，按照作物单位面积产量获得实物报酬。这种制度将来还是要保存下去。
    计划增加拖拉机队工作人员自机器拖拉机站得到的劳动日单位的现金报酬。此外，和往常一样，他们将和集体农民同样地得到劳动日单位的报酬；他们原来因超额完成农作物单位面积产量计划而得到额外工资的办法也予以保留。拖拉机手和拖拉机队其他工人原来的工资支付办法，就是按照有保证的最低限度工资给予谷物工资的办法，将予以改变。以前，他们从集体农庄那里领得谷物，而现在他们将从机器拖拉机站领取。今后，拖拉机队工人按照有保证的最低限额工资（劳动日单位报酬）所应得的粮食，以及利用联合机和其他机器收割作物所应得的粮食，都与交给机器拖拉机站的实物工资一起，由集体农庄交到国家收购站。机器拖拉机站将自收购站领取拖拉机队工作人员的粮食。
    一旦单位面积产量增加，牲畜的产品生产率提高，马铃薯和蔬菜的生产发展，集体农庄的收入以及每一劳动日单位的工资便会提高，拖拉机手和拖拉机队其他工人的工资也就会大大提高。这样无疑地就可以使得人员安定下来。因而，就可以保证更好地利用设备。
    训练拖拉机手、联合机操使者及其他许多行业的工人的制度，迫切需要加以改变。到目前为止，这些干部的训练工作做得非常坏。一个人上了两三个月训练班，被领到机器前面去了几次，就得自己开机器——一个拖拉机手这样就训练成功了。在春天，这个拖拉机手就会勉强地开一部拖拉机到田里去。假如机器发生故障的话，他就只好在拖拉机旁边坐下来等待机械师到来，因为他不知道怎么办了。因此，生产率降低了，机器经常发生故障，工作的质量也很低。一直到现在还存在的短期训练班制度并没有给予受训人员必要的技术知识。这种情况必须加以根本的改变。必须为机器拖拉机站训练知识广泛的机器驾驶员和操使者，使他们能操使拖拉机、联合机和其它机器，并能掌握做机械工作、修理和其它工作的技术。为使人员训练工作建立在适当的基础上，有必要改组现有的机械化学校，并延长训练期限。应该采用工业中的职业学校和工厂学校的训练制度。训练机器操使者的制度应该在尽可能短的时间内完成。在这个问题上不得有一天迟延。
    在最近几年中，许多熟悉业务的、经验丰富的拖拉机手离开了机器拖拉机站到城市中的工厂里工作去了。我们应该号召这些旧日的机器操使者回到机器拖拉机站去。
    可以预料到，由于拖拉机手列入机器拖拉机站编制，并且得到有保证的较高工资，许多过去的拖拉机手也将愿意在机器拖拉机站工作。应该通知各企业部门的负责人不要阻止他们回来工作。
    关于挑选机器拖拉机站管理人员的问题，必须予以特别的注意。一九五一年九月，政府通过了一个“关于改进机器拖拉机站工作的措施”的决定，它就增加工资及达到计划产量的奖金，以及对于机器拖拉机站管理人员的其他形式的鼓励作出了规定。
    但是，许多地方的党组织没有采取措施，给机器拖拉机站补充熟练的人员，没有利用这个决定所提供的可能性，没有尽什么力量鼓励工程师和技术人员到机器拖拉机站去工作。而且机器拖拉机站绝大多数管理人员在工程、技术和农业方面所受的训练的水平，适应不了大规模机械化农业生产的需要。我来举出一些数字，说明机器拖拉机站领导人员的教育水平情形。
    教育水平（以百分比计算）：
    受过高等教育者  受过中等专门教育者  受过初等教育者
  　（实际工作经验者）
    站　长　二二·六　四七　　三○·四
    总工程师　一四·八　二○·八　六四·四
    工长　一·三　八·八　八九·九
    许多站长、总工程师和工长的工作是由没有受过专门教育的人们充任的，对于这种绝对不能容许存在的情况必须予以注意。不难了解，由于缺乏必要的训练，他们常常不能胜任国家托付给他们的工作。用受过专门教育、能够成功地管理机器拖拉机站这种庞大、复杂的企业的人们来担任这些职务，是完全可能的。
    应该指出，我们的教育机构训练高级和中级人员时，是没有适当地考虑农业的需要的。为机器拖拉机站和国营农场训练工程和技术人员的工作做得特别差。从一九四○年到一九五○年，农业专家总数增加了百分之五十三，而受过工程教育的农业专家人数只增加了百分之十二。
    机器拖拉机站的工作能否进一步改进，首先要看我们供给机器拖拉机站以管理和工程技术人员的情况。机器拖拉机站站长一般必须是受过农业机械化方面的必要训练的机械工程师和农学家。应该任命受过高等专门教育的人们担任机器拖拉机站的总工程师和总农艺师。有人或许会问：对于没有受过专门教育、但已表现有很好的管理才能的机器拖拉机站站长应该怎么办呢？当然，在这个问题上，不能一概而论。我们有不少机器拖拉机站的站长虽没有受过专门教育，但在实际工作中熟悉了自己的业务，并善于领导机器拖拉机站的工作。这些工作人员应该留任原职并帮助他们获得较高的教育。
    要以管理人员和工程技术人员来加强机器拖拉机站的工作，就必须在最近的将来从工业和国民经济的其他部门派遣机械工程师到机器拖拉机站充任站长、总工程师和修理间工长。应派遣机械技术人员到机器拖拉机站去当机械师。
    机器拖拉机站有很多的设备，但是还不足以使我们胜利地完成我们面临的任务。所以，苏联部长会议和党中央委员会已订出一个生产拖拉机和其他机器的巨大计划，规定从一九五四年到一九五七年五月一日要供应农业以五十万部一般用拖拉机（以每部十五匹马力计算），二十五万部耕作用拖拉机，以及大量的农业机器和汽车。在以后几年内机器拖拉机站将得到许多新式的耕作用拖拉机，和用于耕种并收割技术作物、饲料作物、马铃薯和其他蔬菜的效能极高的机器，以及使割草、收割青储饲料作物的工作和饲畜部门中的费力操作全面机械化的各种机器。这将有助于大大扩大农业生产机械化。 
    我们必须要求各工业部更主动地设计新机器，改进现有的机器。由于苏联机器制造工业部和农业和农业储存部的关心不够，那些为农业所迫切需要的好的新机器常常毫无理由地拖延很久还未制造，或者制造的数量极少。有一些企业部门在完成制造一些农业机器的计划方面，做得不能令人满意。
    制出的机器的质量不很好。所以农业工作者抱怨是有理由的。许多年以来，联合机操使者、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工人一直指出了C—4 自动推进联合机的严重缺点，它不符合农业的需要，特别是不符合于比较潮湿地区的农业的需要。但是苏联机器制造工业部和农业和农业储存部没有采取必要措施来消灭这些缺点。
    方形簇种法使拖拉机曳引与马匹曳引的中耕机有可能进行行间中耕，这种方法在保证中耕作物——玉蜀黍、向日葵、蓖麻子——单位面积产量增加方面将发挥重要作用，但为采取这种方法，必需有种子条播机。工业在这方面的工作进展得很缓慢。诚然，基洛夫格勒的“红星”工厂生产一种种子条播机，用于来进行玉蜀黍、向日葵与其它作物的方形簇种。但是要得出一个方形，仍需要靠手的矫正。而且这种用手矫正的办法也还没有见效，并没有得出方形来。这就有必要装置一个自动器，像马铃薯种植机一样，利用尺度量器了。在C—6型种子条播机上利用这个原则已经得出良好的结果。
    必须制造一种种子条播机，以在需要栽种密度相当大的地方，用方形簇种法，栽种中耕植物。应该指令研究机关与工厂更迅速地设计出这种种子条播机，苏联农业和农业储存部应该组织这种机器的试验，以使工厂生产这种机器供应给机器拖拉机站。只有我们使播种机械化，中耕机械化，才有可能迅速增加所有中耕作物的单位面积产量。我们没有别的道路。我们工业企业的工人、工程师与技术人员要充分地、及时地完成制造质量高的机器的任务，这是他们的光荣。
    此外，必须特别重视拖拉机和其它机器的修理和保养工作。我们决不能再容忍让机器拖拉机站的精良设备受到不适当的保养，以致不到逾龄时间，就损坏而不能使用了。许多机器拖拉机站到现在还没有修理工场，没有停放机器的房间和敞棚，并缺少其他生产用的房屋。
    在这方面，以下的事实说明了机器拖拉机站存在的不好的情况：四百二十九个机器拖拉机站根本没有修理间，大约五千个机器拖拉机站的修理间的设备不够完备，不能符合修理的要求。许多机器拖拉机站没有工程人员和技术人员所必需的住宅，没有拖拉机手的宿舍和其他房屋。虽然有这种情况，三年来建筑生产用房屋和机器拖拉机站的住宅的拨款却只用去了百分之八十到八十五。首先应对这一情况负责的是各地方农业机关的领导，他们没有采取措施来充分利用这笔款项，而党组织也没有在这个问题上作必要的监督。
    必须结束这种管理不当的情形。在今后三年中，每个机器拖拉机站必须一律有一个标准修理间，至少有两个到三个保管拖拉机的停车间，两个到三个保管联合机的敞棚，必要数量的保管农业机器的棚舍，其他生产用房屋和住宅。为了这些目的已拨出相当大数目的款项。我们的工作是要正当地，郑重其事地来利用这笔款项，并完成所规定的任务。
    组织对机器拖拉机站的设备、工具、金属和其他原料、特别是零件的供应，是非常重要的。
    必须更有效地利用现有的农村电力站、修建新电力站和风力发电设备、并把机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场与国家电力系统结合起来，通过这些办法来扩大农业生产电气化的范围，并使集体农民在日常生活中使用更多的电力。以电力发动的机器供给农业是十分重要的。
    由于集体农庄中机械化工作的总量增加了，机器拖拉机站已开始得到更多的实物报酬。现在的实物工资率是根据下一原则规定的：集体农庄的收获量愈大，实物工资率就愈高。这种制度有很多缺点，因为收获量的多少不仅要看机器拖拉机站的工作质量而定，而且要看集体农庄的工作质量而定。
    常有机器拖拉机站的同一个拖拉机队为两个靠近的集体农庄工作。但是一个集体农庄的收成很好，另一个的收成却很坏。问题在那里呢？问题在于，收成好的集体农庄使用了优良的种子和肥料。而另外一个集体农庄没有这样做，结果收成很坏。第一个集体农庄优渥地以实物支付机器拖拉机站的工作，而第二个集体农庄付出的报酬却很低，虽然机器拖拉机站在两个集体农庄中为每一公顷所付出的实际劳动量是一样的。在实物支付以后，在两个集体农庄中，余下来用作支付每个劳动日单位工资的谷物和其它产品的数量差不多是一样的。
    鉴于目前的对于机器拖拉机站所作的工作支付实物的制度，并不能鼓励最先进的集体农庄，所以应该确定一定的实物支付率以鼓励机器拖拉机站争取提高单位面积产量。苏联部长会议、党中央委员会主席团指令苏联农业和农业储存部就这个问题提出建议。
    应该终止下述不正确的做法，就是只是根据估计数字，而不是根据实际的收成来确定谷物的收成和其它农作物的产量。这种制度并不能刺激作物产量的增加，甚至还阻碍了为反对收割中的损失（这种情况在集体农庄中仍然是严重的）而进行的斗争。目前的估计产量的办法并没有使机器拖拉机站的管理人员始终贯彻地行事，并没有使他们不仅是关心提高产量，还关心到在收割作物的时候不受损失。必须组织计算仓库实收的作物数量，并按照实收数量的多少来给以奖金，这样机器拖拉机站的工作人员就会直接关怀谷物和其他作物的实际收获量。
    机器拖拉机站和集体农庄之间的生产关系将继续由它们之间的合同来规定。应该根据机器拖拉机站的新任务，对标准合同作一些修改。必须再一次地强调指出：机器拖拉机站和集体农庄之间的合同具有法律的效力，履行合同是机器拖拉机站和集体农庄双方的义务。地方苏维埃和党组织有责任保证有系统地督促机器拖拉机站和集体农庄履行合同所规定的义务。
    可见，为了进一步改进机器拖拉机站的工作，必须：
    逐渐使一批熟练的机器操使者成为固定的人员，为此目的，拖拉机手、联合机驾驶员以及其他机器操使员的训练制度必须加以根本的改变，要普遍设立机械化学校，来代替短期训练班；
    增强机器拖拉机站管理人员的阵容；
    提高机器拖拉机站在进一步发展饲畜业中所起的作用，坚决改进设备的使用情况，并保证在最适宜的时间内和最高的水平上来进行农业工作；
    在每一个机器拖拉机站设立拖拉机和农业机器修理厂、汽车间和敞棚等。大力兴建机器拖拉机站专家和工作人员的住宅。
    党组织有责任改进对机器拖拉机站的领导，努力使他们在组织上和经济上进一步巩固集体农庄方面及进一步提高农业方面发挥更大的作用。成功的保证就在这里。
    （六）农业机关的工作和加强对集体农庄在农艺和饲畜方面的帮助
    同志们，克服某些农业部门的落后状态和把整个农业生产提到一个新的更高的水平的任务，向苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、地方农业机关、全体农业专家提出了重大的要求。
    农业机关使用有数以万计的、忠于我们的党的、以他们全部的精力和知识献给农业的继续发展的专家。但是，我们能说所有农业机关对于它们的工作都做得很好吗？不，同志们，我们不能这样说。事实证明，苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部不可容许地落后于生活的要求，它们没有考虑到在集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中正在发生的变化。
    应该指出，苏联农业和农业储存部的机构本身及其地方机关，对于迅速而有效地解决集体农庄和机器拖拉机站所发生的问题并不是适宜的。这个机构非常繁复，它有许多彼此重叠而工作又常常没有良好效果的局和司。这个部不能有效地和正确地领导地方机关，并在解决迫切问题时产生官僚主义和文牍主义的情形，这是不足为奇的。苏联农业和农业储存部和实际活动的联系很差，它和集体农庄、机器拖拉机站没有联系。这个部不了解地方的实际情况，却试图从中央来规定地方农业机关、集体农庄和机器拖拉机站活动的各个方面，并常常发出对当地没有用处的指示。
    问一问从北高加索来的同志，看他们有没有到部里去问怎样种小麦？我相信你会得到一个否定的答复的。乌克兰农业工作者没有问农业和农业储存部怎样种甜菜，乌兹别克农业工作者也没有问怎样种棉花。这是可以理解的，因为我们国家在各地培养了有经验的工作人员。然而部的工作人员依然像以前一样继续领导，错误地以为他们是仅有的懂得一切、能做到一切的人。乌·伊·列宁指出：“如果我们把法令一成不变地用于俄国各地，那就是一个错误。”他说：“如果在中亚细亚、乌克兰和西伯利亚用同样的一套，把它们压进同一个模子，那是十分荒谬的。”这些指示在今天也同样有用。
    农业和农业储存部的工作的缺点在农业计划方面特别显著。计划中有许多不必要的指标，限制住了地方机关、机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的主动性。只要提出下面一点就够了：每年给集体农庄分配的种植业和饲畜业任务中，有二百到二百五十个指标。例如，中央计划了这样一些措施，如由杂交得来的猪的养肥工作应于什么时候结束，播种高茎植物作为休闲地屏障的工作以及其他许多工作等等。由于分派下来了有着许多指标的过分庞杂的任务，下面就必然要制作一大堆各式各样的报告。许多农业专门人材和集体农庄工作人员把精力花在制作各种各样的报告、呈文和统计上去了。在一年中，每一个集体农庄要交将近一万个指标给区农业机关。和战前相比，集体农庄报告中的指标的数目约增为八倍。
    我们批评苏联农业和农业储存部，并不意味着，我们因此就把它的作用估低了。相反，部的作用要更加加强。为了符合于改变了的情况，农业和农业储存部必须改组，干部要大大地裁减。
    苏联农业和农业储存部首先应该拟定农业和它的各部门的计划，以物资、技术和资金供应农业，收购农产品，选拔、安插和训练工作人员，推广先进经验和科学成就以及解决集体农庄的组织问题。
    在这一方面，各加盟共和国和自治共和国的农业和农业储存部以及边疆区和州的农业和农业储存局要起更加重大的作用。而这就意味着，地方农业机关必须补充能够胜任的工作人员，必须改组，干部要裁减，并且要和生产有更加紧密的联系。
    必须特别提到对俄罗斯联邦农业的领导问题。全国有百分之五十七以上的集体农庄和百分之六十二的机器拖拉机站在俄罗斯联邦境内。俄罗斯联邦的播种面积占苏联全部播种面积的百分之六十二以上。俄罗斯联邦的牲畜头数占全国牲畜总头数的百分之五十以上。
    虽然如此，和其他加盟共和国不同，俄罗斯联邦直到最近才有一个拥有必要的权力和经费的真正的农业部。甚至这个共和国境内的机器拖拉机站都不属于农业部。以前，农业部奉命从事马铃薯和蔬菜的生产，实际上，农业部连在这方面都没有必要的物资和技术设备。结果农业部不得不把它的活动限于养兔、养蜂和毛皮业等问题。这听起来像一个笑话，但不幸这不是一个笑话，这是一个事实。
    有着种类繁多的农业生产的俄罗斯联邦，必须有一个拥有必要的权力又有经费的真正的农业和农业储存部。这个部应该负责指导农业各部门和俄罗斯联邦境内的集体农庄和机器拖拉机站的工作。
    加强对集体农庄在农艺和动物饲养方面的帮助的问题也非常重要。我们在这方面已经做了并且正在做许多工作。但是这方面的可能性我们也还没有充分加以利用。
    国家在高等教育机关和中等教育机关中培养了几十万名农业专门人材。单是农业机关就有三十五万多名受过高等教育和中等教育的专门人材。
    但是这些专门人材的使用情况如何呢？结果只有一万八千五百名专门人材，即只有百分之五的专门人材直接在集体农庄工作。每五个集体农庄只有一个专家！五万名专门人材即百分之十四的专门人材在机器拖拉机站工作。另一方面，七万五千名专门人材即百分之二十五的专门人材在农业机关中工作。他们和集体农庄生产的联系是非常不够的。
    适当地使用农业专门人材的问题已不止一次地提出过。在最近几年中，政府已决定提高在机器拖拉机站工作的专门人材的薪水。今天，在机器拖拉机站从事生产的一个农学家和工程师的薪水并不比参加工业的工程师少，在许多情况下，甚至还要多。虽然政府作了这种决定，大部分专门人材仍然愿意留在各机关内工作。
    产生这种不正常的情况的原因是什么呢？首先是各农业机关在解决使用专门人材的问题时并不是从国家利益的观点出发的。农业机关的许多负责人员认为他们的主要工作就是写命令、法规和指示，他们企图把专门人材放在办公桌旁边。农业机关很少想办法去启发每一个专门人材的职业自豪感，很少去激发他的创造探求的精神和百折不挠地改进耕作和牲畜饲养的改造者的精神。
    这种对待农业工作人员珍贵的后备军的态度根本是错误的。我们还是必须使专门人材在生产方面——集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场——工作，从事他们真正的工作——提高单位面积产量和发展饲畜业。
    决议草案规定一九五四年春天至少要送十万个农业专门人材到机器拖拉机站去工作，使每一个集体农庄都有一个农学家，大的集体农庄有一个农学家和一个动物饲养学家。在一个有系统地为一个集体农庄服务的机器拖拉机站工作的农学家必须检查机器拖拉机站和集体农庄之间的合同履行情况。他有责任监督农业技术规程所规定的一切措施的实行。一个农学家决不能容许隐瞒质量低的工作，他要记住，他对于不遵守农业技术规程和容忍拙劣工作的现象稍微采取一点自由主义的态度都是对集体农庄和国家有害的。一个农学家应该对于有关农业工作的质量的每一件事情都感到兴趣，积极地支持集体农庄中每一个新的和先进的经验的采用。
    应该责成一个机器拖拉机站的总农艺师负起一个国家监察员的责任，来监督机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的合同中所规定的工作质量。在这一方面，如果总农艺师在农业技术方面直接受州农业局局长的领导而不受机器拖拉机站站长的领导，这是很正确的。这是必要的，因为这样可以使有关生产和农业技术的问题的考虑不致从狭窄的局部利益出发。有些时候，一个机器拖拉机站站长为了要使一部拖拉机的生产力提高和节省燃料，会容忍浅耕或把春季播种工作开始的时间一直拖到土壤变干以后。一个机器拖拉机站的总农艺师的责任就是在任何情况下，不容许违反农业技术的要求，并始终从这样一个前提出发，就是：只有在机器拖拉机站的工作在高度水平上及时完成，才能得到很高的单位面积产量。农艺师必须成为一个为获得丰收而从事的工作的真正组织者。
    苏联农业和农业储存部必须拟定关于机器拖拉机站总农艺师的地位的条例，清楚地、准确地规定他的权利和义务。
    由于机器拖拉机站在集体农庄生产方面的组织作用的日益加强，现在区农业和农业储存局显然已无存在的必要。在苏维埃区执行委员会中有几个工作人员拟订计划和做会计工作就够了，应该把主要的专门人材调到机器拖拉机站和集体农庄去工作。
    有必要来详细谈谈像在农业中宣传和应用科学成就和先进经验这样重要的问题。
    每一个集体农庄、边疆区和共和国都有许多农业上的革新者、先进集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场。在我们这个时代，管理一种企业而不吸取先进集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的经验和革新者成就，那就意味着，故意要使它落后。
      可惜得很，我们在推广和应用新东西方面还做得
  很差。每一个集体农庄——如果我们可以这样说的话——不得不依靠自己的力量、自己的智慧、自己的经验和它自己的实际工作。但是，有了那些先进者所累积的丰富经验，我们就可以把它应用到所有集体农庄去。
    农业和农业储存部和它所属地方机关迄今还以漠不关心和被动的态度来对待农业方面的新事物，好像它们没有看见似的。许多提高单位面积产量的有价值的和经过试验的方法，多年以来未被采用。
    领导农业首先意味着研究、总结和推广先进经验和科学成就。农业宣传必须成为苏联农业和农业储存部及苏联国营农场部及它们的地方机关全部活动中的主要的、不可或缺的一部分。
    应该指出，对于宣传先进经验和科学成就的工作组织得不好，不仅应由这两个部和它们的地方机关负责。还有许多党和苏维埃机关，把农业宣传这个重要任务，交给一小部分的工作人员去做，而他们自己却袖手旁观。
    党和苏维埃机关的负责人不仅必须报告关于推广最好的经验的必要性，并且最重要的是，它们自己必须研究这种经验并在各集体农庄和国营农场积极推广这种经验。在号召别人行动以前，一个负责人应该到现场去研究先进的工作方法和管理企业的方法，以便他对于号召别人做的工作可能有一个明确的概念，在访问农庄和农场的时候可以给予必要的指示和援助。
    党和苏维埃机关的负责人应号召落后集体农庄的主席、管理委员会委员、工作队队长、小组组长和个别集体农民参观先进企业，在现场详细研究他们的全部工作方法。应该采取适当的影响措施，使落后的集体农庄和国营农场能按照先进集体农庄和国营农场的榜样进行他们全部工作。
    报纸，特别是农业报纸，关于科学成就和最好的经验的宣传是不能令人满意的。关于这些问题的优秀书籍出版得很少，而出版的书籍往往对事实作了肤浅的叙述，没有抓住新的工作方法的本质。
    通俗科学和教育农业影片的摄制工作组织得很不好——影片的质量往往不能令人满意。负责摄制农业影片的往往是些与农业没有接触、对于农业知识很缺乏的人们。
    现在来谈谈集体农庄和国营农场关于农业和动物饲养的学习情况。目前有二百五十多万集体农民和国营农场工作人员在三年制的训练班学习。这当然是一件好事情。但是教学水平很低，它时常是脱离实际的。这一个学年，考试及格的集体农民学生只有百分之六十。有三万个集体农庄没有组织集体农民的农业和动物饲养学习。
    农业科学在进一步发展农业方面有很大的作用。
    必须指出，苏维埃科学对于农业的发展作出了巨大的贡献，尽管如此，它仍然落后于生产的需要。某些研究所和实验站未能很好地解决提高耕作和饲畜的效率的迫切问题。在科学机关中，批评和自我批评没有充分展开，也没有展开创造性的讨论和意见的自由交换。某些科学家时常喜欢别人的阿谀奉承。
    你们知道，政府不惜拿出巨款来发展科学，而且已为科学家们创造了非常有利的工作条件。然而
  ，不幸得很，我们仍有一些这样的科学工作者，他们在论文答辩以后，实际上就没有继续从事研究工作了，而且多年以来对科学、对集体农庄和国营农场的生产没有作出新的贡献。有时他们的论文既没有科学价值也没有实际价值。某些研究机关落后于实际可以由下列事实看出：研究所和实验站的某些实验中心的作物单位面积产量和牲畜产品生产率，还比不上先进的集体农庄和国营农场。
      所有科学机关必须努力解决提高单位面积产量、发展饲畜业的问题，农业的经济和组织问题，以及集体农庄和国营农场生产机械化和电气化的问题。
    区和州的农业展览会应该成为宣传科学成就和推广先进经验以及促进展开广泛地应用这些成就和经验的竞赛的一种重要形式。战前，许多区和州每年都要举行这样的展览会。近年来就很少注意去组织它们了。这种情况应该加以改善。各区和州中心每年必须举行农业展览会。使每一个先进的集体农庄、每一个国营农场和每一个机器拖拉机站都有机会在农业展览会上展出它的成就和经验。与过去不同的是，在展览会中应该拨出一定的地方陈列落后的集体农庄和国营农场的生产指数，使它们看到它们是如何地落后于最好的企业。这样就会促使它们去学习这些先进的集体农庄的先进的方法。建议通过关于一九五四年举行苏联农业展览会的决议。
    因此，为了改进各农业机关的工作和加强对集体农庄在农艺和动物饲养方面的帮助，必须：
    根本地改进对农业的领导，把农业提高到能完成新任务的水平；
      加强农业机关在发展农业中的作用，增派人员到农业机关中去，使它们与机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的联系更为密切；
      改进对集体农庄农业和动物饲养方法的技术服务，至少派十万个农学家和动物饲养学家到集体农庄去工作，以便使每个集体农庄有一两个专门人材；
    坚决地加强宣传先进经验和农业科学成就的工作。
    我所提到的集体农庄和机器拖拉机站领导工作的缺点，也完全适用于国营农场。国营农场在生产谷物、肉类、奶类以及其他物品的高昂的成本，依然是它工作中的一个很大的缺点。
    国家为每一个国营农场的良好经营准备了一切必要的条件，然而因为领导质量的差别，结果也完全不同。
    这里就有一个例子。“矿工”国营农场和“青年团”国营农场都在罗斯托夫州十月区，并且生产条件也相差不多，然而，这里是它们一九五二年工作的结果：
      “矿工”国营农场
    整个播种面积三千九百八十二公顷
    牛的总数一千一百九十头
    其中母牛三百五十二头
    猪八百一十三只
    每头母牛产奶三千零三十五公斤
    每一公担牲畜产品的成本：
    牛奶九十卢布
    猪肉六百四十六卢布
    向国家交售量：
    牛奶九千五百九十五公担
    肉类一千四百一十九公担
    结算结果获利六十八万六千卢布。
      “青年团”国营农场
    整个播种面积三千二百二十二公顷
    牛的总数一千一百一十七头
    其中母牛四百零九头
    猪六百六十一只
    每头母牛出产牛奶一千九百三十四公斤
    每一公担牲畜产品的成本：
    牛奶一百一十四卢布
    猪肉一千四百五十七卢布
    向国家交售量：
    牛奶六千二百七十九公担
    肉类九百三十二公担
    结算结果亏损四十万七千卢布。
    产生这种截然不同的结果的原因是什么呢？因为“矿工”国营农场的领导者是有经验的饲畜家鲍瓦连金同志，而“青年团”国营农场的领导者庞达连科同志是一个没有受过必要训练的不好的组织者。虽然他显然不能胜任他的职务，但是，国营农场部竟容许他担任场长达十年之久。
    许多国营农场都是由训练不好的工作人员领导的。苏联国营农场部所属的二千零六十四个国营农场场长中，有六百四十四个场长、即占总数的百分之三十一的场长，是甚至没有受过中等专门教育的实际工作者。在农场各部门和牲畜饲养部的负责人员中，有百分之九十三没有受过专门教育。在国营农场约有四分之三担任主任机械工程师职位的工作人员是实际工作者。
    我们的任务是要使每一个国营农场都有赢利，并且出产很多商品。为了达到这个目的，必须加强国营农场的领导干部的阵容。必须在落后的国营农场中进行整顿工作，消除浪费现象，厉行节约国家资财和大力减低生产成本。必须考虑取消现行的国家补助制度，因为它养成国营农场领导者的依赖心理，不能鼓励他们为改善国营农场的工作而进行顽强的斗争。
    要使得所有国营农场都成为可以示范的企业——这就是我们的任务。
    （七）乡村中的党的政治工作问题
    同志们！要顺利地解决我们面前的农业方面的任务，就需要党组织进行许多组织工作和政治工作。如果认为农业会平静地、顺利地、自然而然地进一步提高，那是错误的。
      党和政府现在为进一步加强集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场而创造着一切物质上和技术上以及组织上的条件。我们有一部分的工作人员可能因此而产生这样一种心理：认为现在万事大吉，可以高枕无忧了。没有比这样一种心理再危险的了。这种心理可能带来极大的损害。
    要是没有党的州委会、区委会、党的基层组织以及机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场的领导者来进行组织工作，物质条件和潜力是不能自发地产生应有的效果的。为了利用这些潜力和条件，必须动员我们全部的人力物力，进行大力的组织工作，发动广大的集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员来完成进一步提高农业的任务。
    我们党在乡村有不小的力量。现在七万六千个集体农庄中都有集体农庄党组织。乡村中的党员数目现已超过一百万人。乡村中青年团员计有二百万人以上。如果我们能正确地支配和利用这些力量，那末我们就能完成这一切任务，克服在我们达到目的的道路上所遇到的一切困难。为此各级党组织应该更加依靠非党积极分子和集体农庄中的先进人物。
    近几年来党为展开党内民主、展开批评和自我批评而采取的措施，在很大程度上促进了党员积极性的发挥，促进了党组织的巩固以及党组织和劳动群众联系的加强。
    同时必须承认，乡村党组织的工作还存在着严重的缺点。在许多党组织中党的政治工作跟经济任务脱了节。我们的工作人员讲得倒不少，说政治与经济是不可分割的，说政治必须与完成经济任务结合起来，而实际上他们却把政治工作与日常的经济建设工作割裂开了。这种情形首先可以从农业领导干部、特别是集体农庄主席的工作中看出来。
    为了能取得成绩，必须把注意力集中在主要的方面，这主要的方面就是：以熟练的、有能力的干部和我们优秀的工作人员来加强机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场。要完成提高农业方面的迫切任务，首先依赖于：用有经验的、经过考验的、忠诚老实的、能够组织工作和正确选拔、配置人员的领导人，来加强机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场。
    任何指示，无论制定得多么好和多么详尽，如果没有好的执行者和有能力的组织者实地执行，就不能在提高农业方面起应有的作用。如果领导集体农庄的不是一些内行的工作人员，指示就不会带来任何好处。
    集体农庄已经壮大，并成为大规模的、拥有多样性经济的农庄。在合并以前平均每个集体农庄有五百八十九公顷的耕地，而现在就有一千六百九十三公顷的耕地。领导这样的农庄，确是一件复杂的、责任重大的工作。
    党中央委员会和苏联部长会议在三年前通过了一项关于加强集体农庄主席和其他领导工作人员阵容的决定。过去也曾在改进集体农庄领导干部的选拔工作方面做过一些工作。相当多的专家以及有组织工作经验的实际工作者被提拔为集体农庄的主席。
    可是供给领导干部以加强集体农庄的工作还是做得不好。仅仅有一万六千六百个集体农庄的主席具有高等或中等专门教育程度。而大多数集体农庄主席的教育程度还很低。
    由于选拔集体农庄主席的工作做得不好，他们时常被调换。约有三分之一的集体农庄主席的任期都不到一年。还有许多集体农庄一年换两三个主席。其中有许多人都是因为不能胜任工作或是滥用职权而被撤职的。有不少这样的例子：区党委会把那些工作失败的或犯有盗窃罪的人从一个集体农庄调到另一个集体农庄，强迫农民接受他们。
    现在任务是：在短期内加强集体农庄主席的阵容，改进对他们的教育工作。同时也必须十分注意生产工作队队长的选拔工作。随着集体农庄的合并，生产工作队也开始扩大了，因而必须由有经验的人、好的组织工作者、诚实的集体农民来领导。
    党在乡村中曾经培养了许多优秀的干部。在许多区可以用当地的工作人员来加强集体农庄主席的阵容。但是我们还有不少的区，这一方面需要帮助。值得注意的是：在许多州内感到集体农庄干部问题有一定的困难。这些困难是由于在战争期间损失了相当多的干部而造成的。此外，在战后年代里大批教育和文化程度最高的集体农民都转到工业部门中去工作了。因此在某些区内选拔好的干部的可能性就受到限制。我们必须帮助这些区。
    除了选拔地方干部，调动专门人材以外，还必须选派各工业中心的共产党员去担任集体农庄的领导工作。
    党曾经派遣了二万五千名工人去到乡村，他们在农业的社会主义改造方面进行了巨大的工作。此外，党在一九三三年，还派遣了一万七千名党工作人员去帮助集体农庄，担任政治部的工作。在各个时期，还有成千其他工业工作人员被派到机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场。这是对集体农民的重大的帮助。大多数被派的工作人员热情地投入这一工作，并且光荣地报答了党的信任。虽然他们起初并没有必需的农业知识，但是，因为他们有着高度的政治修养和组织工作的经验，很快地掌握了自己的业务，表现出自己是有才能的领导者，并且为巩固集体农庄做了许多工作。我们可以援引许多例子，说明党派遣到乡村里去的共产党员所做的卓越的工作。党组织应当全力支持这些人，因为他们在为人民进行着艰巨而崇高的工作，巩固着工农联盟。
    在目前的情况下，社会主义城市以干部帮助集体农庄乡村，是进一步加强工农联盟——苏维埃社会力量的不可动摇的基础——的重要形式之一。
    我们完全有可能保证所有集体农庄得到经过训练的干部。叫受过高等教育的农业专门人材担任集体农庄主席当然很好。但是，我们也必须重视很好的实际工作组织者。我们有许多实例说明有许多集体农庄的主席是实际工作者，但是他们的工作也做得很好。
    落后的集体农庄首先需要好的组织者。我们选拔集体农庄主席时，应当竭力使每一个集体农庄的领导者是能够团结集体农民和胜利地领导大规模的经济的有经验、有文化的组织者。
    有什么理由在现在，当我们苏维埃知识分子增加了的时候，党不号召也不吸引城市的优秀人物
  （假如说是五万名左右共产党员罢），把他们派去加强乡村的工作呢。我以为我们是能够做到这一点的。在这里，在全体会议上，我们应对这个问题和对其他的问题一样地交换意见。
    我们可以满怀信心地说，如果党对工业中心的共产党员发出这样的号召，那么，就能找到许多志愿去到乡村工作并把他们的力量和知识贡献给进一步巩固集体农庄制度的事业的人。必须要派遣认识到这个工作的全部重要性、经过考验的共产党员，派遣那些认为自己是乡村中永久的而不是暂时的工作人员的人。我们必须照顾他们，关怀他们。
    如果我们用干部加强集体农庄，那么，那些各式各样的、往往是不懂农业和不是经常给集体农庄以必需的援助的委员就没有必要了。派遣工作人员去到集体农庄去做永久工作，比较派遣委员有着无比的好处。
    改进农业领导的迫切的任务是提高区党委会和区苏维埃执行委员会在发展集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中的作用。如果不加强区的环节，不正确地配置党的力量，不善于组织整个党的工作，我们就不可能把对集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导提高到能适应新任务的水平。
    许多农业区没有足够的受过训练的党和苏维埃干部。有些区党委和区苏维埃执行委员会的工作人员在业务上不能适应目前对领导人员所提出的提高了的要求。特别应该谈谈的是农业区区党委书记的阵容。如果审查一下履历表，情况多多少少是不错的。有百分之九十以上的书记有八年和八年以上的党龄，百分之八十受过中等和高等教育。
    那么农业区领导干部的弱点在什么地方呢？弱点在于：他们中间有些人不大懂农业，没有必需的组织工作经验。农业区区党委书记中有一半左右做党的工作在五年以下。有三分之一的书记做这个工作还不到一年。许多区党委和区苏维埃执行委员会的领导人都是经验少的干部，他们很难以应有的水平领导区、机器拖拉机站和集体农庄。
    我们有没有可能派必要的党和苏维埃的干部来加强区的环节呢？不用说是有的。只不过应当正确地配置和使用人力，缩减各州、边疆区和共和国中心机构的人员，撤消多余的上层机构，把很大一部分优秀的工作人员调去加强区的环节、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场。
    有些州没有提拔做党和苏维埃工作的必要的后备干部，因而把工作能力差的工作人员调来调去。如果没有中央委员会的帮助，这样的州就很难用自己的力量来解决改善领导区的任务。我们应当帮助他们。因此，必须从优秀的共产党员中选拔数千优秀的干部，把他们派到农业区的区党委和区苏维埃执行委员会去工作。
    应当注意的是，必须慎重处理更换缺乏经验的领导干部的问题。党和苏维埃的能力薄弱的工作人员只能以更强的、更有训练和更有经验的工作人员去替换。那些被解职的同志，假如他们对党采取好的态度的话，应把他们送到调训班和党校加以教育，使他们成为好的领导者。把对关于社会主义农业的技术、经济和组织等问题的研究列入干部调训班和党校的课程中，显然是有益的。
    农村工作是最重要而光荣的工作。党组织应当铲除某些甚至担任负责职务的共产党员对待农村的傲慢和官僚主义的态度。还有一些工作人员认为农业区、机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场的工作是次要的工作。这种人不懂得这个简单的真理：没有农业的高涨就不可能胜利地解决共产主义建设的任务。没有丰裕的粮食、肉、牛奶、油、蔬菜及其他农业产品，共产主义社会是不能够建成的。
    我们的任务就是：使党组织注意尽速发展农业。必须以干部来加强有关领导农业的各个部门。要把大批在机关里工作的专门人材调到生产上去，加强集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导干部和一般干部；加强区党委会和区苏维埃执行委员会的领导阵容。这个工作必须立即开始，至迟在明年一、二月基本完成，以使成千的新提拔起来的有才干的党与非党的组织者到明年春天能为提高产量和发展饲畜业而斗争。
    其次，必须消灭机器拖拉机站和集体农庄领导中无人负责的现象。在各区里面有大批的党、苏维埃和农业机关的工作人员，平均每一个集体农庄都差不多有五、六个负责工作人员。在这种情况下，实际上谁也不负责过问集体农庄和机器拖拉机站的事情，不过问群众中的政治工作。
    可以这样说，区党委书记、区苏维埃执行委员会主席、区执行委员会农业科科长、机器拖拉机站站长以及其他许多人都在负责集体农庄和机器拖拉机站的工作。但是区里面实际负责集体农庄工作的是谁呢？没有任何人对你作肯定的答复，因为对具体的集体农庄没一个人负责。这里就存在着对集体农庄领导的根本缺点。实际上是无人负责领导集体农庄的，往往是这样进行领导：区党委或区苏维埃执行委员会的工作人员坐着汽车巡视集体农庄，一天工夫就跑遍半个区，常常是汽车都不下就发号施令。
    对集体农庄基层党组织的领导也存在重大的缺点。这首先表现在：很少例外的区党委对集体农庄党支部书记不大进行工作；对巩固党的组织和把非党集体农民中的积极分子团结在党组织的周围一事，没有予以必要的关怀。在许多党组织里面，以马克思列宁主义教育共产党员的工作仍然进行得不好。
    州党委会和区党委会没有采取应有的措施以提高集体农庄党组织在解决集体农庄任务中的作用。许多集体农庄的党组织过于庞大。许多集体农庄党组织是由专职书记来领导。党中央委员会根据州党委会和区党委会的请求，已决定三千七百四十七个有最大的党组织的集体农庄可以设置一个专职书记。但是并不是到处的党委会都认真地对待集体农庄党支部书记的选拔工作。常常是那些不成熟的、没有受过训练的、甚至有时是随手抓来的人被推荐来担负这一工作。
    在许多集体农庄中群众政治工作还停在很低水平上，对劳动人民的政治教育没有给予应有的注意。还有些负责人员，不对集体农民进行深入的日常工作，而只下命令，破坏苏维埃法律。在许多集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中，对集体农庄男女庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员的文化生活方面的服务做得很糟。有些区的党和苏维埃机关很少注意为居民组织电影放映工作。
    还有一些区对作为争取提高农业的斗争中的强大力量的青年团组织估计不足。很少吸收青年团员和农村青年，去解决提高农业和发展公有饲畜业的任务。
    在农业中，妇女们——我们光荣的集体农庄女庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的女工作人员——是起着特别巨大的作用的，她们在集体农庄和国营农场的各个生产部门中提供了忘我劳动的卓越的范例。老实说，有许多党组织没有认识到这一点，在妇女中间所做的工作不能令人满意。
      州党委会和区党委会必须坚决清除存在着的这些严重缺点，提高党在广大劳动人民群众中的政治工作的水平。
    要达到这一目的，必须消灭对乡村的社会政治工作以及机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的领导工作无人负责的现象。党的领导与具有决定意义的生产部门加强联系的时候已经到来了。在现阶段必须这样来重新组织党机构的工作：一定的集体农庄由一定的工作人员进行工作，并对这个农庄负责，由他负责正确地选拔干部，正确地分配人员，在集体农庄庄员中间进行政治工作，解决本农庄的任务。
    为了就这个问题交换意见，现在提出我们的看法如下：我们认为，农村区党委应在每个机器拖拉机站中有一组受区党委书记领导的工作人员。举例说，如果一个区有三个机器拖拉机站的话，那末这个区就可以组织三个指导员小组（每个机器拖拉机站一个小组），以使一个集体农庄（最多两个集体农庄）有一个指导员，他在集体农庄中对区党委负责。指导员在一般党的机关中、特别是在区党委中的作用应该特别提高。因此，应该注意选拔指导员和培养他们。
    领导指导员小组的区党委书记必须指导他所属的指导员，为机器拖拉机站地区内的各集体农庄服务，组织党在机器拖拉机站工人以及各集体农庄中的工作，并对区党委负责这些集体农庄的情况。为了具体领导集体农庄和党基层组织的工作，区党委书记必须把自己的全部工作时间花在机器拖拉机站。这样就好了，因为这样就可以减少文牍主义，多做实际工作。因而也就不必要再在机器拖拉机站中设立负责政治工作的副站长了。受第一书记领导的区党委的常务委员会，应该掌握在各机器拖拉机站和集体农庄中工作的指导员小组的工作，同时还要领导全区的一切经济和文化生活。
    我们认为，实行这些办法，就可以推进整个组织工作和党的工作，消灭各集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和党的基层组织无人负责的现象。
    现在要谈谈党的州委会领导农业工作的作风和方法中的缺点。党中央委员会有一切理由要求改进这种领导工作。我们掌握的材料说明有许多党和苏维埃的领导工作人员并没有深入到集体农庄事务中去。这些工作人员没有充分研究集体农庄的经济和先进经验，工作粗枝大叶，以空话、忽冷忽热的工作代替了对集体农庄的切实帮助。
    甚至有一些州党委书记也不懂农业，不想去研究它，而是用一些毫无用处的空话和肤浅的指示来应付。如果州的党组织的领导者甚至不知道那一个集体农庄丰收，那一个集体农庄主席好、那一个工作队长先进，难道我们可以认为这是正常的吗？要是州党委书记或是加盟共和国共产党中央委员会书记不完全了解农业中先进工作法的优点，不知道州内集体农庄饲畜情况，譬如，什么作物作为饲料最好，集体农庄和国营农场的这些作物的收获量如何等等，难道我们可以容许这种情况存在吗？遗憾的是，我们还有这样一些领导者。
    必须坚决铲除肤浅地领导农业的办法。为了能正确地领导，必须研究各地方的情况，研究集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场的情况，和干部、首先是和集体农庄主席保持紧密的联系，研究先进的经验并应用在生产中。党和苏维埃领导工作者不一定要成为农学家，但是他们应当通晓农业问题。任何一个工作人员，只要他希望成为一个真正有用的工作者，这是可以办到的。我想，这样的要求是完全正确的。
    同志们！现在全国各地区有着不少在经济上巩固的集体农庄，这些集体农庄获得丰收，牲畜的产品生产率很高，胜利地完成对国家的义务，收入丰厚，每年保证集体农民的劳动日得到高额的实物报酬和现金报酬。实行上述关于进一步提高农业的措施，就能保证集体农庄和集体农民的收入不断地大大增加。集体农民的文化和物质要求将大大增加，而且将要继续增加。
    因此，我们必须谈一谈集体农庄乡村的文化生活建设和改善设备的一些问题。许多工作人员问：这项工作今后如何进行？回答只有一个：这要看具体条件。在那些集体农庄已经壮大、并且有着这方面的必要的物质潜能（这样的集体农庄已经有不少了）的地方，必须首先建设生产用的房屋以及改善集体农民居住区的建筑。
    随着集体农庄的发展，集体农庄将有可能把自己的一部分收入用于建设公有建筑、托儿所、幼儿园和产妇院方面，从而为集体农庄女庄员创造更好的条件，使她们从事集体农庄生产和更积极参加社会生活。在经济上巩固的集体农庄，可以拨款建筑俱乐部，从而为集体农民中间的社会政治工作和文化教育工作创造更为优越的条件。建议集体农庄帮助集体农民修理和建筑房屋、谷仓及宅旁建筑物，帮助他们获得在自己的果树园中栽种的果树幼苗，供应集体农民燃料和其他需要。同时必须牢记，主要的方面是提高收获量，提高饲畜业，发展农业的各个部门。只有在农业生产有新的大力提高的基础上，才能解决改善集体农庄乡村的任务，才能解决进一步提高集体农民的文化和生活水平的任务。经常关心提高劳动人民的物质文化生活水平，是一切党组织和苏维埃的最重要的责任。
    我还想谈一个问题，就是关于庄子（XYTOP ）的问题。大家知道，波罗的海沿岸各共和国——立陶宛、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚——有许多庄子。现在当这些共和国基本上完成了集体化的工作时，当地某些工作人员提出了这样的问题：对庄子怎么办？应当如何处理庄子？我们认为，这里不能有两种意见。在其他的共和国和州内，根据政府的决定，庄子还在战前就取消了。我们主张逐步取消庄子制度，而建立公共的集体农庄乡村。这就能够创造更加有利的条件来提高集体农庄生产，可以改善集体农民的文化生活条件，建立良好的学校、医院、产妇院和儿童福利机关。
    但是，在实际解决这个问题上犯急性病是不对的。党和苏维埃机关应该会同集体农民一道全面地考虑当地的可能的条件，然后根据可能的条件来解决关于在什么地方、什么时候以及如何进行这一工作的问题。我们相信一定可以找到正确的解决办法。集体农民自己不愿意过庄子生活，他们将提出必须改善文化生活条件的问题。
      要实现关于进一步发展农业的重大措施，在很大程度上要依靠党组织在群众中的工作。农业工作人员的创造力量是无穷无尽的，我们应该更加积极地动员这种力量。党的工作人员、全体共产党员应当广泛地宣传发展农业的迫切任务，促进提高作物单位面积产量和牲畜的产品生产率的社会主义竞赛。为此，必须经常深入群众，经常对群众进行工作，很好地去了解人们，了解他们的困难和要求，善于及时地发现和支持有益的创举，预防可能的错误和失败。党组织在自己的全部工作中应该依靠集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中的先进人物，依靠农业和饲畜业中的能手，他们的队伍将一天一天成长和壮大起来。
    党组织必须：保证提高党的组织工作和群众政治工作，把党的政治工作跟解决经济任务的工作密切地结合起来；立即采取措施加强区党委会、机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场的干部的阵容，把对所有农业部门干部的领导工作提高到更高的水平；改变一部分工作人员把乡村工作看成次要工作的这种不正确观点；消灭在集体农庄领导中的无人负责的现象，改组区党委机关，使党组织和集体农庄及国营农场的生产紧密联系起来；提高州党委员会和区党委员会领导农业工作的水平，坚决禁止某些工作人员的命令主义；克服对领导集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场采取官僚主义的表面态度。
    党组织的责任是：发动所有男女集体农民、机器拖拉机站工作者、农业专门人材为进一步提高各种农作物的单位面积产量和发展公有饲畜业而斗争，使得每一个集体农庄胜利完成向国家交售农产品的义务，使它们有必要的种子和其他储备，并保证进一步加强公有经济和提高集体农民劳动日单位的报酬。

    同志们！苏维埃国家正无比强大，它满怀信心地向共产主义前进。共产主义建设纲领的重要的组成部分是：在社会主义工业——国民经济的主导力量——大大发展的基础上，实际地解决在我国生产丰足的农产品的任务。
    现在，这个任务已成为我们全体人民的迫切任务。这一任务的胜利解决也将促进工人阶级和集体农民联盟的进一步巩固。
    我们坚信：在共产党的领导下，工人阶级、集体农民、我们的知识分子和全体苏维埃人民，一定会在最短的期间内完成这一任务。这将是我国向共产主义迈进的一大步！
