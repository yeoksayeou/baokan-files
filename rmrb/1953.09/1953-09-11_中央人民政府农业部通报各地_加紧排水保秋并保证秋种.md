The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued a circular to all regions on September 10 regarding draining accumulated water to save the autumn harvest and ensuring autumn planting. The full text of the circular is as follows:

Since the beginning of autumn, heavy rains have fallen continuously in the northeastern provinces and in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other provinces, causing river water to rise sharply, and autumn crops have suffered varying degrees of damage. After vigorous rescue efforts by various regions and a turn in the weather, the water level has gradually receded. At present, all flood-affected areas must continue to exert their utmost efforts to drain water, save the autumn harvest, and ensure the timely sowing of wheat.

I. All areas with accumulated water should take all possible methods to dredge and guide drainage according to urgency, strive to reduce the flooded area, and try to rescue all crops that can be salvaged; promptly disseminate effective experience among farmers to avoid rotting seedlings, and try to reduce losses of grain and other crops this year; make every effort to increase the harvest of grain and other crops. At the same time, we should continue to prevent autumn floods, repair breaches, and prevent dykes from overflowing in drainage channels with large and rapid flows.

II. In areas where excessive rain makes it easy for pests to breed, while draining water to save seedlings, a portion of the labor force should be appropriately organized, or the masses should appropriately divide the work themselves to eliminate pests in a timely manner to prevent their spread, ensuring that drainage, seedling rescue, and pest control are all done effectively.

III. All disaster-stricken areas should earnestly understand the situation of farmers lacking wheat seeds and quickly take measures to help farmers solve the difficulties of wheat seeds based on the principle of on-site adjustment. As for the lack of fertilizer, farmers should be encouraged to accumulate fertilizer to solve the problem. Especially in many disaster areas, the replanting area has increased, and the fertilizer is relatively reduced, and the land is weak. If fertilization is not increased vigorously and appropriately, it will inevitably affect the wheat harvest next year. The "Four Cleanliness" method (clean houses, clean courtyards, clean toilets, clean pigsties) proposed by Henan Province can be used for reference. We must earnestly rectify and restore mutual aid and cooperation organizations to improve their mutual assistance effectiveness. We must also overcome various difficulties brought about by the disaster, such as the reduction of agricultural tools and plowing cattle.

IV. In disaster areas, the policy of production for disaster relief should be earnestly implemented to stabilize the emotions of the victims, vigorously lead the masses to engage in production for self-rescue, replant vegetables, collect wild vegetables and other substitutes for food, and save resources during the famine. And use loans and relief grain funds in a timely manner to help the victims solve their difficulties, support the victims to restore production, and overcome the famine.

V. Areas with low-lying terrain that cannot complete drainage and wheat planting should prepare early spring wheat and early-maturing crop seeds and autumn grain seeds suitable for local spring sowing next year to prepare for next year's sowing.

    中央人民政府农业部通报各地
    加紧排水保秋并保证秋种
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部在九月十日发出了关于排除积水抢救秋禾并保证秋种的通报。通报全文如下：
    入秋以来，东北各省和河北、山东、河南等省，连降大雨，河水猛涨，秋禾遭受不同程度的损害。经各地大力抢救和天气转晴后，水势逐渐下落。目前各受淹地区，必须再接再厉大力排水，抢救秋禾，保证小麦适时播种。
    一、凡有积水地区，应分别缓急，采取一切可能方法进行疏导，尽力缩小水淹面积，尽力抢救一切可能挽救的庄稼；及时传播农民中的有效经验，避免禾苗腐烂，尽力减少今年粮食和其他农作物的损失；尽一切可能提高粮食和其他农作物的收获量。同时，应继续预防秋汛，抢堵决口，对水大流急的排水河道也须预防漫决。
    二、凡因雨多地湿害虫容易滋生的地区，应在排水救苗同时，适当组织一部分劳动力或由群众自行适当分工及时除治，勿使蔓延，做到排水、救苗、除虫三不误。
    三、各受灾地区，应切实了解农民缺乏麦种的情况，迅速采取措施，本就地调剂的原则，帮助农民解决麦种的困难。至于所缺肥料，应鼓励农民积肥解决，特别是许多灾区，增加了复种面积，肥料相对减少，地力薄弱，如不大力适当增肥，势必影响明年麦收。河南省所提四净办法（屋净、院净、厕净、圈净）可以参考。切实整顿与恢复互助合作组织，提高其互助效用。还须克服灾害带来的各种困难，如农具、耕牛之减少等等。
    四、在灾区应切实贯彻生产救灾政策，安定灾民情绪，大力领导群众生产自救，补种蔬菜，采集野菜等代食品，节约度荒。并及时运用贷款和救济粮款，帮助灾民解决困难，扶植灾民恢复生产，战胜灾荒。
    五、地势低洼不能完成排水种麦的地区，应及早准备适合于当地明年春播的春麦与早熟作物种子和秋粮种子，为明年播种作好准备。
