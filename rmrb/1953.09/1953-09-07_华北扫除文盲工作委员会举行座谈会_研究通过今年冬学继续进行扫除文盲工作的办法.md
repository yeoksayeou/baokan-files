    The North China Administrative Committee's Illiteracy Eradication Work Committee Office convened a symposium from August 27th to 31st, bringing together the directors of the illiteracy eradication committees' offices from three provinces and two cities in North China, as well as key special districts and counties. They exchanged information on the illiteracy eradication work in various parts of North China and studied specific methods for continuing illiteracy eradication work through winter study programs.
    After rectification, the illiteracy eradication work in the North China region has resulted in approximately 700,000 people learning 2,000 characters in the past year. If we use 1,000 characters as the standard, about 1 million people have reached this standard. Currently, 2.2 million people are still persisting in regular study. This year's winter illiteracy eradication work will be carried out through the winter study movement. The symposium clarified that this year's winter study movement must be based on rectification and, following the principles of serving production and voluntary participation by the masses, be carried out in a guided and planned manner. In the winter study movement, a group of illiterates will be eliminated; at the same time, political and production education will be carried out.
    Peasants who voluntarily participate in winter study and have the conditions to learn culture will be organized into cultural or literacy classes (groups) to carry out literacy education. In the cultural literacy classes, political and current affairs lessons will be given regularly, and a wide range of farmers will be absorbed to participate in listening to the lessons. Political lessons generally take the form of large lectures, and teaching should also be conducted through entertainment and exhibitions that are easy to attract the masses. According to the experience of rural illiteracy eradication work in North China over the past year, literacy education can be carried out using improved conventional teaching methods, absorbing some of the advantages of rapid literacy methods, according to the characteristics of adult spare-time learning.
    In accordance with the rectified policy, this year's winter study movement will mainly rely on volunteer teachers to carry out teaching, with literate people teaching illiterate people, and people who know more characters teaching people who know fewer characters. Attention will also be paid to mobilizing teachers who have already met the illiteracy eradication standards to actively participate in this winter's illiteracy eradication work. In addition, an appropriate number of full-time teachers will be set up as the backbone.
    This year's winter study period will strive to officially start classes in November throughout the North China region and end at the beginning of spring plowing in March 1954, transitioning to regular people's schools. Efforts will be made to end the previous period of illiteracy eradication work before this year's autumn harvest. During the autumn harvest, full-time teachers are required to be trained once. Near the end of the autumn harvest, volunteer teachers will be selected and hired according to past experience in selecting volunteer teachers, and short-term training will be conducted.
    The symposium also studied the organizational leadership issues of this year's winter study movement. The general principals of people's schools in each province, city, and district will lead the principals of people's schools and full-time teachers to carry out their work under the dual leadership of the county's illiteracy eradication office and the district government. In order to solve the problems of winter study teaching and administration in a timely manner, the school department can be jointly organized by the principals of people's schools, primary school teachers, and volunteer teachers, with each responsible for their respective tasks. Due to the emphasis on rapid literacy in the past year, which neglected the usual teaching of winter schools and people's schools, before carrying out the winter study illiteracy eradication work this year, all localities must conduct extensive and in-depth publicity to prepare ideologically for carrying out this year's winter study.

    华北扫除文盲工作委员会举行座谈会
    研究通过今年冬学继续进行扫除文盲工作的办法
    华北行政委员会扫除文盲工作委员会办公室在八月二十七日到三十一日召集华北三省二市及重点专区、县的扫除文盲委员会办公室主任举行座谈会，交换了华北各地扫除文盲工作情况，并研究了通过冬学继续进行扫除文盲工作的具体办法。
    华北区的扫除文盲工作经过整顿后，一年来已有约七十万人学会了两千字，如以识一千字为标准，约有一百万人达到了这一标准。现在坚持常年学习的仍有二百二十万人。今年冬季的扫除文盲工作，决定通过冬学运动进行。座谈会明确了今年的冬学运动，必须在整顿基础上，根据服务生产及群众自愿的原则，有领导、有计划地深入开展，在冬学运动中，扫除一批文盲；同时在冬学运动中开展政治教育与生产教育。
    凡自愿参加冬学而有条件学文化的农民，将组织文化或识字班（组）进行识字教育。在文化识字班中，定期上政治时事课，并将吸收广大农民参加听课。政治课一般采取上大课方式，同时也要通过文娱展览等易于吸引群众的形式进行教学。根据华北一年来农村扫除文盲工作的经验，识字教育可按照成人业余学习特点，吸收速成识字法若干优点，以改进了的通常教学方法进行教学。
    按照整顿后的方针，今年冬学运动主要依靠义务教师进行教学，识字的人教不识字的人，识字多的人教识字少的人，并注意发动已经达到扫除文盲标准的教员积极参加今冬扫除文盲工作。另外将适当设置一定数量的专职教师作为骨干。
    今年冬学期限，华北全区争取在十一月正式开班上课，到一九五四年三月底春耕开始时结束，转为常年民校。在今年秋收前争取结束上期扫除文盲工作。秋收期间，要求把专职教师训练一次。秋收将近结束时，按以往选拔义务教师的经验，分别选聘义务教师，进行短期训练。
    这次座谈会还研究了今年冬学运动的组织领导问题。各省市区民校总校长，在县的扫除文盲办公室与区政府双重领导下，领导民校校长、专职教师进行工作。为了及时解决冬学教学及行政等问题，可由民校校长、小学教师及义务教师等共同组织校部，分工负责。由于去年强调速成识字忽视冬学、民校的通常教学，今年在开展冬学扫除文盲工作前，各地必须进行一次广泛深入的宣传，为开展今年冬学作好思想准备。（新华社）
