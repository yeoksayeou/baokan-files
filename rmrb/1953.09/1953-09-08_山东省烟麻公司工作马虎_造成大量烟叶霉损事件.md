    Shandong Tobacco and Hemp Company's Careless Work
    Causes Large-Scale Mold Damage to Tobacco Leaves
    Reader Ping Yu writes: In the past, when the Shandong Tobacco and Hemp Company's affiliated flue-cured tobacco factory carried out labor competitions, the leadership onesidedly emphasized increasing output, resulting in a large amount of tobacco leaves being sent to the finished product warehouse for storage before being thoroughly cured, leading to mold and deterioration. In March of this year, the Shandong Tobacco and Hemp Company organized an inspection team to specifically inspect the mold and deterioration of tobacco leaves in the factory and overturned the accumulated stacks of tobacco. However, because the work of preventing mold and deterioration of tobacco leaves was not done thoroughly, the deterioration of tobacco leaves continued to occur. In July of this year, millions of pounds of red and yellow tobacco prepared for export by the company were initially inspected by the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and a large portion of it was found to be substandard. Afterwards, although the company organized more than 300 workers to process and select the tobacco, the selection work was done very hastily, and the processed tobacco leaves were still found to be substandard upon inspection. The company simply stopped actively trying to deal with this batch of tobacco; later, only after repeated urging from the China National Native Produce Export Corporation, did they have to select and process it bundle by bundle, handful by handful. However, due to the prolonged delay, the mold damage to the tobacco leaves increased, and the state property suffered great losses.
    The Shandong Tobacco and Hemp Company and its affiliated flue-cured tobacco factory's careless attitude towards work, which caused undue losses to state property, is intolerable. It is recommended that the China National Tobacco and Hemp Corporation conduct a serious inspection of the above-mentioned events, deal with them seriously, and help the Shandong Tobacco and Hemp Company improve its future work.

### 山东省烟麻公司工作马虎  造成大量烟叶霉损事件

专栏：读者来信摘要

    山东省烟麻公司工作马虎
    造成大量烟叶霉损事件
    读者平羽来信：山东省烟麻公司所属烤烟厂过去在开展劳动竞赛时，由于领导方面片面强调提高产量，以致有大量烟叶因为未经烤透就送交成品库储存，而霉烂变质。今年三月份，山东省烟麻公司曾组织了检查大队专门检查该厂烟叶霉烂情况，并把积存烟叶倒垛。但由于防止烟叶霉烂的工作做得不彻底，烟叶变质情况仍在继续发生。今年七月份该公司准备出口的数百万斤赤黄烟，经过中央对外贸易部商品检验局初步检验，有很大一部分是不合规格的。事后该公司虽然组织了三百多工人进行加工挑选，但是由于挑选工作做得十分草率，加工过的烟叶经检验仍然不合规格。该公司竟也就不再积极设法处理这批烟叶了；后来经中国土产出口公司多次催促，才只得每包、每把地进行挑选加工。但由于拖延日期过久，烟叶霉损增多，国家财产受到很大损失。
    山东省烟麻公司和所属烤烟厂对待工作的马虎态度，使国家财产遭受不应有的损失，这是令人不能容忍的。建议中国烟麻公司对上述事件认真检查，严肃处理；并帮助山东省烟麻公司改进今后工作。
