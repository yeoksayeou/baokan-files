Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 21st: U.S. authorities are desperately fabricating pretexts to deceive public opinion at home and among its allies, who are demanding the withdrawal of troops from Korea, and to conceal the U.S. plot to station troops in South Korea long-term and obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

According to a dispatch from International News Service reporter Hyman in Seoul on the 20th, "Senior military officials in Seoul and Tokyo are very distressed by the possibility that public opinion in the United States and the United Nations may demand the withdrawal of combatants." "The commanders of the Allied forces are trying their best not to reduce the UN forces due to pressure from domestic demands for troop withdrawals." To this end, they have fabricated a ridiculous excuse, saying that the Rhee Syngman puppet army, which was expanded under the support of the United States, needs "close monitoring" by the U.S. military, attempting to use this lie to "convince the American people that all or most of the American troops still need to remain in Korea."

However, it can be seen that this statement by the United States is still the same old trick that has long been exposed. Everyone knows that the Rhee Syngman army is entirely nurtured by the United States. The United States equips it, trains it, and commands it to attack North Korea, and it launched this war. In fact, it is the most docile pawn in the hands of its American master. Now, the United States wants to portray this pawn as a fierce lion that is difficult to control. No one will be fooled by this. Hyman admitted in the same message that the Rhee Syngman army is currently expanding under the support of the United States. The puppet army has American military advisors, and the support units of the puppet army's three corps and each division have also been equipped with American aid. According to the United States, it is afraid of this Rhee Syngman puppet army, even afraid enough to use a large number of troops to "closely monitor" it; however, the United States uses advisors, money, and equipment to cultivate something it fears. How can this make sense?

This is obviously illogical. The real intention of the United States has in fact been revealed in Hyman's report. He said: The presence of U.S. troops in Korea makes "this mountainous peninsula will become an American garrison. A well-informed staff officer said that garrisoning Korea means there will be a long-term plan to build military fortresses and residential areas for military dependents." It can be seen that the so-called "monitoring" of the Rhee Syngman army is merely to deceive the American people and its allies, so that they agree to keep troops stationed in South Korea for a long time and continue to serve the U.S. government's aggressive policies. The U.S. plan is to refuse to withdraw troops in order to continue to maintain tension in Korea and make South Korea a bridgehead for its aggression in the Far East.

From this, one can also see the attitude of the United States towards the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. According to the armistice agreement, the withdrawal of foreign troops is a matter that the Korean political conference should discuss first and is a prerequisite for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The U.S. attempt to station troops in South Korea long-term, like its stubborn opposition to the Korean political conference adopting a round-table format and inviting neutral countries to participate, proves that the U.S. is deliberately obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and lacks sincerity towards the Korean political conference.

### 美国准备在南朝鲜长期驻军  证实美国对政治会议无诚意

    美国准备在南朝鲜长期驻军
    证实美国对政治会议无诚意
    【新华社开城二十一日电】美国当局正竭力制造藉口，欺骗其国内和盟国要求自朝鲜撤出军队的舆论，掩饰美国准备在南朝鲜长期驻留军队、阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的阴谋。
    据国际新闻社记者希马夫二十日自汉城发出的电讯透露：“汉城和东京的高级军官对美国和联合国的舆论可能要求撤回战斗员一事很伤脑筋”。“联军司令官们正竭力不使联合国军因受到国内要求撤回军队的压力而减少”。为此他们制造出一种可笑的藉口，说什么：在美国一手扶植下扩大起来的李承晚伪军，需要美军“严密监视”，企图用这种谎话来“说服美国人民，让他们相信，所有的美国军队或大部分的美国军队仍需要留在朝鲜”。
    然而，人们可以看出，美国的这种说法，仍旧是那一套早已为人识破的老戏法而已。谁都知道，李承晚军队完全是美国喂养起来的，美国给它装备，给它训练，美国要它向北朝鲜进攻，它就发动了这次战争，实际上，它是美国主子手里牵着的最驯顺的走狗，现在美国要把这条走狗说成是难于控制的猛狮，这是没有人会上当的。希马夫在同一条消息中承认，目前，李承晚军队正在美国的扶植下进行扩充，伪军里有着美国军事顾问，伪军三个兵团和每个师的支援部队也已经用美国的援助装备起来。照美国的说法，它是害怕这支李承晚伪军的，甚至怕得要用大批军队来加以“严密监视”；可是，美国又用顾问，又用钱，又用装备来培植它害怕的东西，这怎么能说得通呢？
    这显然是不合逻辑的。美国的真正意图事实上在希马夫的报道中已透露出来了。他说：美国军队留在朝鲜，使“这个多山的半岛将变成一个美国的驻防地，一个消息灵通的参谋军官说，驻防朝鲜意味着要有一个建筑军事要塞和军属居住区的长期计划”。可见所谓“监视”李承晚军队，不过是为了欺骗美国的人民及其盟国，使他们同意把军队长期驻留在南朝鲜，继续为美国政府的侵略政策服务。美国的打算就是要拒绝撤军以便继续在朝鲜保持紧张形势，并使南朝鲜成为它在远东进行侵略的桥头堡。
    人们由此也可看出美国对和平解决朝鲜问题的态度。按照停战协定，撤退外国军队问题是朝鲜政治会议应首先讨论的一个问题，是和平解决朝鲜问题的先决条件。美国企图在南朝鲜长期驻军的态度，就像它顽固地反对朝鲜政治会议采取圆桌会议形式及邀请中立国参加一样，证明美国蓄意阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题，对于朝鲜政治会议并无诚意。
