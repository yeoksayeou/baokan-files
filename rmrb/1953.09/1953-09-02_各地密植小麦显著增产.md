Significant Wheat Yield Increases Through Close Planting Across Various Regions

In regions that focused on promoting close planting of wheat last year, this year's harvests have seen marked increases, proving that close planting of wheat is the most effective method for increasing yield per unit area. In Hebei Province and other areas that originally practiced wide-row, large-ridge, sparse planting, the promotion of over 400,000 mu of close-planted wheat last year has resulted in good harvests this year. The Xu Sizeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fancun, a suburb of Shijiazhuang, used a multi-row seeder method to reduce row spacing on its 42.5 mu of wheat land, implementing close planting across the board. This year, the average yield per mu reached 477 jin, an increase of 57% compared to last year's average, exceeding the average yield of the entire village this year by 41.3%. The Hu Yanyu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xing'an Village, Gaocheng County, close-planted 59.1 mu of wheat last year. This year, the average yield per mu was over 385 jin, doubling the yield of ordinary farmers in the area. In Dongniujiaomiao Village, Xingtai County, all 137 mu of wheat land in the village were close-planted, resulting in a general increase of about 30% compared to last year. In Shandong Province, wheat fields where close planting was promoted also saw significantly higher yields this year compared to last year. In Laiyang County, close-planted wheat yielded 30% more than sparsely planted wheat. In Huangfu Village, Dali County, Shaanxi Province, the row spacing was adjusted from the original 6.5 to 8 inches by modifying the three-legged seeder, reducing it to 5.5 inches. This year, the village's 418 mu of wheat had an average yield of 247 jin per mu, exceeding the county's average yield by 45% and increasing by 97.6% compared to last year. Furthermore, in Dali County, Lei Zhenyong learned from Shi Anfu's method of broadcasting in furrows with a 5-inch row spacing and a 3-inch sowing width, using an average of 21 jin of seeds per mu, resulting in a yield of 737 jin per mu this year. Winter wheat close-planting experiments conducted in Shanxi Province last winter also yielded good results. According to over 120 comparative experiments, close-planted wheat generally yielded 15% to 20% more than sparsely planted wheat, with the highest reaching over 50%.

In southern rice-growing areas, the wide-row strip planting of close-planted wheat also yielded higher than sparse planting. The Weiyuan County Farm in Sichuan Province, using wide-row strip planting with a 6-inch sowing width and an 8-inch row spacing, harvested an average of 565 jin of wheat per mu, more than four times the yield of sparse hill-drop planting in the past.

Close-planted wheat also possesses a certain degree of cold resistance. Close-planted wheat in areas that suffered from frost damage last winter and spring experienced less damage and recovered faster. For example, the Yang Shiqin Production Cooperative in Sixian County, Anhui Province, under the guidance of the farm, used a multi-row seeder to reduce the row spacing from 8 inches to 4 inches and improved cultivation and fertilization techniques. Despite the frost damage, it still achieved a yield of 209 jin per mu. Under the same conditions, sparsely planted wheat yielded only 186 jin per mu. In Tianqiao Township, Linquan County, Anhui Province, where wheat generally yielded only 70 to 80 jin per mu after frost damage, the close-planted wheat of the old farmer Huang Wenjing, using a multi-row seeder, yielded 200 to 300 jin per mu. In Wen County, Henan Province, the close-planted wheat (3.5-inch row spacing) of Zhang Tushu and Sun Fu suffered only 20% mortality from frost damage; the sparsely planted wheat of Ma Xiaojin and Ma Qiwu, using ordinary sowing methods, suffered 90.5% mortality. The Shi Yucheng Mutual Aid Team in Zhilou Village, Shan County, Shandong Province, implemented narrow-ridge, even, and close planting on 25 mu of its 30.4 mu of wheat land last year. The remaining 5 mu of wheat land also had a wider sowing width than in the past. At the same time, they did a good job in drought prevention and moisture retention, timely sowing, and increased fertilizer application. This year, the wheat seedlings grew strong, and the stalks were firm. Despite suffering a series of disasters such as freezing, wind, and drought, the average yield per mu still reached 276.3 jin, an increase of 131 jin per mu compared to last year and 154 jin per mu more than the local masses' wheat this year.

Farmers in regions with successful experiences in promoting close planting of wheat now have a further understanding of it. When these regions began promoting close planting of wheat last autumn, many farmers had concerns, the most common of which were fears that close planting would easily lead to yellowing, lodging, and insufficient soil fertility, resulting in only stalks and no ears. Some also believed that dry land was not suitable for close planting. Practice has proven that these concerns are unfounded, educating these people and leading them to begin correcting their incorrect views on close planting of wheat. For example, the old farmer Li Laojing initially wanted to compete with the close-planted wheat of the Xu Sizeng Cooperative using his sparsely planted wheat, but in the face of the stark contrast in yield between the two, he was completely convinced.

However, there were also some shortcomings in the promotion of close planting of wheat in various regions, the main one being that some cadres and farmers had not truly thoroughly understood how to implement close planting. For example, Zhang Linsheng in Xiajiluo Village, Zhaocheng County, Shanxi Province, used over 30 jin of seeds per mu for close planting, exceeding the local masses' seed usage by 1.5 times, but he did not reduce the row spacing, increase the number of rows, or appropriately widen the sowing width and scatter the seeds evenly. As a result, the wheat seedlings grew crowded, and after removing one-third of the wheat seedlings in the spring, the yield per mu was still lower than the average yield of the entire village by 9%. In addition, some individual regions adopted the method of using multi-row seeders to combine rows for close planting, but due to the close distance between the two rows and poor technical mastery, some wheat seeds were buried too deep in the soil, resulting in broken rows and missing seedlings. In the future promotion of close planting of wheat, attention should be paid to strengthening technical guidance and overcoming these shortcomings.

    各地密植小麦显著增产
    去年重点推广小麦密植的地区，今年的收成都显著的增加了，证明密植小麦是提高单位面积产量的最有效的办法。河北省等地原来实行宽行大垅稀植的地区，去年推广了四十多万亩密植小麦，今年都得到很好的收成。石家庄市郊范村许思曾农业生产合作社的四十二亩半小麦，去秋用套耧办法缩小行距，全部实行了密植，今年每亩平均产量四百七十七斤，比去年每亩平均增产百分之五十七，超过今年全村平均产量百分之四十一点三。藁城县兴安村胡雁雨农业生产合作社去年密植的五十九亩一分小麦，今年每亩平均收麦三百八十五斤多，比当地一般农民的产量增加一倍。邢台县东牛角庙村，全村一百三十七亩小麦地，全部实行了密植，今年普遍较去年增产三成左右。山东省推广小麦密植的麦田，今年的产量也都比去年增加很多。莱阳县密植的小麦比稀植的要多产百分之三十。陕西省大荔县的黄甫村在原来六寸半到八寸行距的基础上，调整了三腿耧脚，使行距缩小到五寸半，今年全村四百一十八亩多小麦，每亩平均产量二百四十七斤，超过全县平均产量百分之四十五，较去年增产百分之九十七点六。又大荔县雷振永学习史安福顺沟撒种，五寸行距三寸播幅，播种量平均每亩二十一斤，今年每亩得到了七百三十七斤的产量。山西省从去冬进行的小麦密植试验也都得到良好的结果。据一百二十多个对比试验，密植的比稀植的小麦一般都增产百分之十五到二十，最高的达百分之五十以上。
    南方水稻地区推广的宽幅条播密植小麦，也比稀植的产量高。四川威远县农场，采用六寸播幅八寸行距的宽幅条播小麦，平均每亩收麦五百六十五斤，较过去点播稀植的增产四倍多。
    密植的小麦还具有一定的抗寒作用。去冬今春遭受霜冻害地区的密植小麦受害程度较轻，恢复生长也较快。如安徽省宿县杨士钦生产合作社，在农场指导下，用套耧将八寸行距缩小到四寸，并改进了耕作和施肥技术，虽然经过霜害，每亩仍获得二百零九斤的收成。在同样条件下稀植的小麦，每亩只打一百八十六斤。安徽省临泉县田桥乡，小麦遭受霜冻后，一般每亩只收七、八十斤，但老农黄文敬用套耧密植的小麦，每亩能收二、三百斤。河南温县张图书和孙福的密植小麦（行距三寸半），受霜灾后只冻死了百分之二十；马小近和马奇武用一般播种法稀植的小麦冻死了百分之九十点五。山东省单县知楼村史雨成互助组三十点四亩小麦，去年有二十五亩小麦实行窄垄均匀密植，其余五亩多小麦也比过去加宽了播幅，同时都做好防旱保墒、适时播种、增施肥料等工作，今年麦苗生长茁壮，秸秆坚实，虽然遭受了一连串的冻、风、旱等灾害的侵袭，每亩平均仍获得了二百七十六点三斤的产量，比去年每亩增产了一百三十一斤，比今年当地群众的小麦每亩多收一百五十四斤。
    推广小麦密植有成就的地区的农民，目前对小麦密植已有了进一步的认识。这些地区在去年秋开始推广小麦密植时，许多农民都有顾虑，最普遍的是怕密植容易生黄疸，容易倒伏，怕地力不够只长秆子不长穗。也有的认为旱地不能密植。实践证明了这些顾虑是没有根据的，它教育了这些人，使他们开始纠正了对小麦密植的不正确的看法。如老农李老景开始想农业生产用稀植麦和许思曾合作社的密植麦竞赛，可是在两种产量相差悬殊的对比下，他已心服口服。
    但是各地在推广小麦密植中也曾存在若干缺点，其中主要的是有些干部和农民还没有真正透彻了解如何实行密植。如山西赵城县下纪落村张林生为了密植，每亩地用种子三十多斤，超过当地群众用种量一倍半，但并没有缩小行距，增加行数，也没有适当加宽播幅，匀散种粒。结果麦苗生长拥挤不堪，在春季拔去了三分之一的麦苗后，每亩产量较全村平均产量仍减产了百分之九。此外也有个别地区采用靠耧并垄办法实行密植，由于两行距离太近和技术掌握不好，致有部分麦种被土埋的过深，造成断条缺苗现象。在今后推广小麦密植中，应注意加强技术指导，克服这些缺点。
