    Hebei Province's Duliujian River Opens Floodgates for Diversion

    The recently completed floodgate of the Duliujian River in Hebei Province was opened on September 1st. This will allow accumulated water in Jinghai and other areas to be smoothly discharged into the sea, creating favorable conditions for drainage work. This year, there has been abundant rainfall in North China, with particularly high rainfall in Hebei Province. The rainfall in the Tangshan and Cangxian regions has reached approximately 800 millimeters. In August, continuous heavy rain caused widespread flooding in the five major river systems of Hebei Province, leading to waterlogging disasters in many places. In order to alleviate the flood disaster, the Hebei Provincial Party and government leading organs, with the approval of the Central Government, opened the Duliujian River floodgate to implement flood diversion measures.

    After the Duliujian River diverts the floodwaters, it can reduce waterlogging on 300,000 mu of farmland in the Daqing River East Depression, including Baxian, Wen'an, Shengfang, and Jinghai, allowing floodwaters from the Xingaifang diversion and accumulated water in southern Baxian to be discharged into the Duliujian River through the Daqing River East Depression. It can also lower the water level of the Ziya River, greatly reducing the waterlogging disaster in the Jiakou Depression, which covers an area of 500,000 mu west of the Grand Canal and east of the Ziya River in Jinghai County. This will create extremely favorable conditions for drainage work in the vast areas south of Jiakou Depression along the Heilonggang River, including more than ten counties such as Jinghai and Qingxian. Most or part of the accumulated water in these areas can be discharged into the Jiakou Depression through the Heilonggang River and then into the Ziya River. Farmers in the vast areas can expect to plant their crops. The areas with deeper waterlogging can also be drained early, so as not to delay spring plowing next year. (Xia Ming?, Zhang Peng)

    河北省独流减河开闸分洪
    最近完工的河北省独流减河进洪闸于九月一日提闸放水，静海等地的积水将可顺利宣泄入海，为排水工作创造了有利条件。今年华北地区多雨，河北省雨量特别大，唐山和沧县专区的雨量已达八百公厘左右。八月间，霪雨连绵，河北省五大河系普遍涨水，很多地方积水成灾。河北省党政领导机关为了减轻水患，经中央批准后，便开放独流减河进洪闸，采取分洪措施。
    独流减河分洪后，可以使大清河东淀包括霸县、文安、胜芳、静海等地的三十万亩农田减除水患，使新盖房分洪水和霸县南部积水通过大清河东淀宣泄入独流减河；还可使子牙河水位降低，南运河以西，子牙河以东包括静海县五十万亩面积的贾口洼大大减除积水灾害。这样就给贾口洼以南沿黑龙港沿岸的静海、青县等十余县的广大地区的排水工作创造了极有利的条件。这些地区大部或部分积水都可通过黑龙港泄入贾口洼，再泄入子牙河。广大地区农民播种有望。积水较深的部分，也可提早泄出，不误明年春耕。    （夏鸣?、张鹏）
