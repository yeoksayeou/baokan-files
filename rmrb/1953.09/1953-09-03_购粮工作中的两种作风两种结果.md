Two Styles and Two Results in Grain Procurement Work
Jing Ruiqing

The Northwest Region Cooperative's work of purchasing grain on behalf of the state was arranged as early as May this year. Except for individual areas where the maturity period was later and the purchase contracts have not yet been signed, the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and the city of Xi'an have all signed purchase contracts one after another and are conducting purchases. This year, the cooperative's total purchase task accounts for a large proportion of the state's purchase plan, which is a major political task for the cooperative.

Judging from the situation in Shaanxi Province, most areas, especially the main wheat-producing areas, have had a bumper harvest this year. According to preliminary statistics, the province has increased production by more than 35% compared to last year. Under such favorable conditions, it is possible to successfully carry out the purchase work and complete the task. However, as of now, most cooperatives are far from completing the purchase task according to the original plan. According to our recent preliminary inspection in Weinan, Baoji and other places, the main problems currently existing in the purchase work are as follows:

First, some leading cadres of cooperatives do not have sufficient understanding of the major political task of purchasing grain on behalf of the state, and mistakenly believe that this is the cooperative's "incidental work," holding a negative attitude of "collecting as much as they can." For example, the Lintong County United Cooperative actually only sent one person to guide the purchase work, and he also had to handle other businesses, so he did not have enough understanding of the situation of the various purchasing points, and even less could he do specific leadership and assistance to the lower-level cooperatives. Some primary cooperatives did not actively carry out purchases, but passively waited for farmers to come to sell. For example, the Baoji Weihe Bridge Cooperative locked its doors three times a day when the purchase began (locked the door for breakfast, locked the door for lunch, and locked the door after 2 pm). When the masses carried wheat, they had to take it elsewhere to sell when they saw the door locked, which affected the purchase work.

On the contrary, cooperatives that attach importance to purchase work and can actively think of ways to carry out purchase work have a large purchase volume. The Mei County and Chaoyi County Cooperative United Cooperative, together with the responsible cadres of the grain department, went to the countryside to conduct on-site inspections, discovering problems and guiding work at any time. Therefore, as of the end of July, Mei County's purchase volume accounted for more than 60% of the total task.

Secondly, in terms of purchase methods, many cooperatives do not consider the convenience of farmers, thus affecting the purchase work. The Lei Ya Cooperative in Baishui County set up a purchasing station in a deep courtyard, without a sign outside. Some wheat-selling farmers could not find the place, and some, even if they found the place, had to go to the street store to collect money after weighing. As for the necessary reception for the masses, it was out of the question. The Pinglu Temple Cooperative in Pucheng County only prepared one scale for purchasing, and did not even have tools for inspecting wheat. When inspecting the wheat, they had to pour the wheat out of the bag, inspect it, and then put it back in to wait for weighing. In this way, the masses felt that selling wheat at the cooperative was too slow and troublesome, which was both troublesome and time-consuming, and they were reluctant to sell wheat at the cooperative.

In contrast, some cooperatives take more consideration for the masses when purchasing, simplifying procedures, selecting appropriate locations, and providing thoughtful hospitality, which are welcomed by the masses. For example, the Qishan and Fengxiang counties cooperatives, because they felt that the chaff had to be removed once when weighing, they changed to using fixed wooden buckets to remove the chaff, saving the masses a lot of time and improving work efficiency. The Bai Sa Cooperative in Sanyuan County concentrated the necessary procedures such as inspection, weighing, ticketing, and payment in the purchase, arranged in order, and farmers only needed to go through the procedures in order when selling grain, without asking questions. The cadres of the Baoji Xiguan Cooperative personally boiled water in the morning to wait for the masses, and took turns eating during meals, collecting grain whenever they arrived, whether early or late, never delaying the masses' time, thus mastering more than 80% of the market grain and over-fulfilling the purchase plan for July. The masses in these places realized that their own cooperative was good and were willing to sell wheat to the cooperative. Therefore, improving the methods and methods of purchase business and taking care of the convenience of the masses as much as possible is an important guarantee for vigorously carrying out purchase work.

Third, the general cooperatives do not do enough in combining purchases with organizing the supply of goods, and cannot meet the needs of farmers after selling wheat for purchases. Many cooperatives' retail sales have decreased compared to before after the start of purchases, and the currency withdrawal figures are very poor. For example, in the Chengguan Cooperative in Qishan County, the total daily sales of three stores in early July were less than one-third of the daily wheat purchase and supply, and after mid-July, it dropped to one-fifth. In addition, the business methods cannot actively facilitate the masses, and the method of delivering goods to the countryside is not adopted, but sitting and waiting in the store, thinking that it is troublesome to bring goods to the countryside and there is not much income. In fact, according to the experience of many cooperatives, delivering goods to the countryside in exchange for grain is an effective way to carry out purchase work.

There are also individual cooperative cadres who are afraid of trouble and are unwilling to sell goods in small quantities, and mistakenly limit the number of goods that members can buy. For example, the Baoji Weihe Bridge Cooperative stipulates that oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar must be bought in half a catty or one catty, and small quantities such as four taels or ten taels are not sold, and cloth must be bought at least one foot, and half a foot is not sold. This phenomenon must be quickly corrected.

Fourth, in the purchase work, some cooperatives do not pay attention to cooperating with banks and other relevant departments to help farmers clear their loans and debts, thinking that this is a matter for the banking sector. Therefore, they procrastinate in accepting loans that farmers request to voluntarily repay before they are due, and loans that farmers request to repay in grain, which affects farmers' enthusiasm for repaying loans. Some cooperative cadres actively cooperate with relevant departments in the purchase to go to the countryside to collect old loans in exchange for wheat, solving the inconvenience for farmers to sell wheat and repay loans. For example, the Chang'an Weibin Cooperative cadres recovered 170 million yuan in loans from July 10 to the end of the month, including 70,000 catties of wheat used to pay off loans.

From the above problems, it can be seen that two different styles in the purchase work have produced two different results. Cooperatives in various places should immediately correct those wrong ideas and styles, and learn those methods and methods that facilitate the masses and actively purchase, in order to successfully complete the purchase task.

    购粮工作中的两种作风两种结果
    景瑞卿
    今年西北区合作社代国家收购粮食的业务，早在五月间就作了布置。除个别地区因成熟期较晚还没有签订代购合同外，陕西、甘肃、新疆、青海各省及西安市都已先后签订了代购合同进行收购。合作社今年总的收购任务，占国家收购计划的比重很大，这是合作社的一项重大的政治任务。
    根据陕西省的情况来看，今年大部分地区特别是主要产麦区丰收，据初步统计，全省比去年增产百分之三十五以上。在这样有利条件下，顺利展开收购工作，是能够完成任务的。可是截至目前，大部分合作社完成收购任务的情况，较原订计划还差得很远。根据我们最近在渭南、宝鸡等地的初步检查，目前收购工作中主要存在着如下几个问题：
    首先，就是有些合作社的领导干部，对代国家收购粮食这一项重大的政治任务认识不足，错误地认为这是合作社的“捎带工作”，抱着“收多少算多少”的消极态度。如临潼县联社实际上只派了一个人指导收购工作，还要兼办其他业务，因而对各收购点的情况了解不够，更无法做好对下级社的具体领导与帮助。有的基层合作社没有积极展开收购，而是消极的等待农民上门来卖。如宝鸡渭河桥合作社，收购开始时是一天三锁门（早饭锁门、午饭锁门、下午两点以后锁门），群众把麦背来，一看门锁着，只好拿上到别处去出卖，这样就影响了收购工作。
    相反的，凡是重视收购工作能主动想办法开展收购工作的合作社，收购量就大。郿县和朝邑县合作社联合社，与粮食部门的负责干部下乡实地检查工作，随时发现问题、指导工作，因此，郿县截至七月底，收购量已占总任务的百分之六十以上。
    其次，在收购的方式方法上，很多合作社不是从便利农民方面设想，因而影响了收购工作。白水县雷衙合作社把收购站设在一个深院里，外面也没挂出牌子，有的售麦农民找不到地方，有的就是找到地方，过磅后还得到街上门市部去取款，至于对群众必要的招待更是谈不上。蒲城县平路庙合作社，收购时只准备了一杆秤，连验麦的工具也没有，验麦时要把麦从口袋里倒出来，验完后再装进去等着过秤。这样，群众感到在合作社卖麦太慢、太麻烦，既费事、又耽误时间，多不愿到合作社去卖麦。
    与此相反，有些合作社在收购时多替群众着想，简化手续、选择适当地点、招待周到，受到群众欢迎。如岐山、凤翔等县合作社，因为感到在过秤时都要除一次皮，便改用固定的木斗除皮，节省群众许多的时间，而且也提高了工作效率。三原县柏嵯合作社在收购中，把验级、过秤、开票、付款等必经手续，集中一起，排成次序，农民卖粮时只是按顺序办理手续，不再问东问西。宝鸡西关合作社干部，早晨起来就亲自烧开水等候群众，吃饭时轮着吃，无论早晚随到随收，从不耽误群众时间，因而掌握了上市粮的百分之八十以上，超额完成了七月份的收购计划。在这些地方的群众，都体会到还是自己的合作社好，都愿把麦拿到合作社来卖。因此改进收购业务的方式与方法，尽量照顾群众的便利，是大力开展收购工作的重要保证。
    第三，一般合作社对于结合收购组织货源供应做的不够，不能满足农民售麦后购买的需要。很多合作社在开始收购以后零售额反而较前降低，货币回笼数字很差。如岐山县城关合作社，七月上旬三个门市部每天销货总额还不到每天购麦投放额的三分之一，至七月中旬以后，下降到五分之一。另外，经营方式不能主动便利群众，不采用送货下乡的方法，而是坐守门市，认为带货下乡麻烦，没多大收入。其实根据好多合作社的经验，送货下乡以货换粮是展开收购工作的有效办法。
    还有个别合作社干部怕麻烦，不愿零星卖货，错误地限定了社员买货数量。如宝鸡渭河桥合作社规定油、盐、酱、醋，必须买半斤或一斤，如四两、十两等零数一律不卖，布至少要买一尺，半尺不卖。这种现象必须迅速纠正。
    第四，有些合作社在收购工作中，对于配合银行等有关部门，帮助农民清还贷款与欠款等工作不重视，认为这是银行部门的事，所以对农民未到期而要求自愿归还的贷款，以及农民要求以粮折还的贷款都推拖收受，影响农民还贷款的情绪。有些合作社干部在收购中，主动配合有关部门，下乡用麦折收旧贷，解决农民卖麦还贷款的不便。如长安渭滨合作社干部从七月十日到月底，即收回贷款一亿七千万元，其中就有顶贷款的七万斤小麦。
    从以上的几个问题中，可以看出在收购工作中两种不同的作风，产生了两种不同的结果。各地合作社应该立刻纠正那些错误的思想与作风，学习那些便利群众、积极收购的方式与方法，以期胜利地完成收购任务。（原载群众日报）
