    The Symbol of the Eternal Friendship Between the People of the Soviet Union and Poland
    ——A Visit to the Construction Site of the "Stalin Palace of Culture and Science" in Warsaw
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xie Wenqing
    "When you see a towering building under construction in the city center, you've arrived in our Warsaw." A Polish student who was on the same plane with me leaving Beijing, knowing I was going to Warsaw, introduced the city to me in this way: "That is the Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science, a gift from the Soviet people to the Polish people. It symbolizes the eternal friendship between the Polish and Soviet peoples." On July 20th, as the plane slowly landed in the cloudless Warsaw sky, I immediately spotted this huge building under construction.
    The Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science was built according to Stalin's initiative, with an agreement signed by the governments of the Soviet Union and Poland in Moscow on April 5, 1952. All construction costs of the Palace of Culture and Science, including the wages and labor protection expenses of the Polish workers participating in the construction project, are borne by the Soviet side. Major construction materials such as steel bars and water pipes, as well as all the modern machinery required for construction, are supplied by the Soviet Union. The design of the Palace of Culture and Science is a meticulous masterpiece of Soviet architects. Led by Academician L. Rudnev of the Soviet Academy of Architecture, the Soviet architects spent a lot of effort in the design to ensure that the building embodies the style of Polish national architecture. To commemorate the great teacher of the world's working people, Comrade Stalin, the best friend of the Polish people, and to commemorate the Soviet people's fraternal assistance to the Polish people, the Polish Parliament and the Council of Ministers decided in March of this year to name this socialist building the "Stalin Palace of Culture and Science." In front of the Palace is Stalin Square, covering an area of more than 50,000 square meters.
    I visited the construction site of the Palace of Culture and Science three times. However, each visit not only made me deeply appreciate the consolidation and development of the profound friendship between the Soviet and Polish peoples, but also witnessed the high achievements of socialist architectural science. Currently, the steel skeleton has reached a height of thirty stories, and the wall decoration and internal installations have progressed to the seventeenth floor. However, on such a vast construction site, there are not many workers to be seen. As my Polish friend Janina told me, "There are very few people, but it rises one floor per week." A Soviet veteran worker, Comrade Ponomorev, who works there, said to me: "This Palace of Culture and Science is 220 meters high and has a volume of 800,000 cubic meters. Since the start of construction, 500,000 cubic meters of concrete, more than 13 million bricks, and tens of thousands of tons of steel have been used. Look!" He pointed to the various cranes and transport trucks that were working and said, "All materials are made according to the design drawings, then loaded onto trucks by automatic loaders and transported to the construction site, and then hoisted by cranes to be installed where needed."
    What this Soviet veteran worker said was completely true. During my three visits to the construction site, I did not see anyone carrying, lifting, or picking things at all. Manual labor is reduced as much as possible. There are seventeen electric automatic cranes working there. There are Soviet-produced "Beksum" Type 14 electric cranes that can lift five tons. At the highest point of the building, there are four "Ubek" Type 15 high-altitude universal cranes that can lift fifteen tons. This type of crane can not only lift ready-made heavy steel materials to the highest floor, but also install them where they are needed. Its position is always maintained about ten meters above the highest floor of the building. It can be applied to the construction of houses of any height. On this construction site, which relies entirely on machines, the "most strenuous" labor for workers is nothing more than operating machines, adjusting currents, and welding steel, water pipes, etc. Therefore, the number of female workers on the construction site accounts for more than 15% of all workers. In addition, socialist construction technology also ensures that construction work can proceed smoothly in the severe cold of minus forty degrees Celsius. The construction of the Stalin Palace of Culture and Science is also carried out day and night, regardless of windy, cloudy, rainy, or snowy weather. Every night, from all over Warsaw, one can see the bright lights on the "Ubek" Type 15 high-altitude universal cranes and the white sparks emitted from the welding pipes.
    The construction project of the Stalin Palace of Culture and Science is also the best school for Polish construction workers and technicians. In their joint work with Soviet workers, Polish workers are learning and using the latest socialist technologies and working methods. Currently, Polish workers account for one-third of all workers participating in the construction. In order to train more Polish workers who master the latest technologies, the number of Polish workers participating in the construction will soon increase to one-half of all construction workers. The joint work of Soviet and Polish workers embodies the deep friendship between the two peoples. Soviet technicians and workers impart socialist technology and working methods to their Polish worker brothers. For example, Polish worker P. Vicaikin, who was a farmer not long ago, has now become the most outstanding work team leader. The work team he leads adopts the Soviet Kovalev working method, exceeding the plan by 250%. The work team led by Polish worker A. Shenu exceeded the plan by 226%. Excellent workers like them have emerged in batches.
    Every day, workers, farmers, and students from all over Poland continue to come to Warsaw in an organized manner to visit the construction project of the Stalin Palace of Culture and Science, in order to personally understand the progress of this construction project that embodies the friendship and assistance of the Soviet people to the Polish people. On average, thousands of people visit each month, and during the "Soviet-Polish Friendship Month" in November of last year, there were as many as 3,000 people per day. After the visitors returned, they spread the word. Polish worker Y. Puvichin said to me when talking about the Soviet government and people's fraternal assistance to the Polish people in all aspects: "In the anti-fascist struggle, the sons and daughters of the Polish and Soviet people shed blood together on Polish soil; today, in peaceful construction, the workers of our two countries are sweating together in the same place. This traditional friendship has been deeply engraved in the hearts of the Polish people!" His words immediately reminded me of a memory from my recent visit to various parts of Poland. It was on August 6th in Wroclaw, southwestern Poland. In the Soviet Army Martyrs Park in the city, I met a child named Gertke. When I asked him how old he was, he replied, "I am as old as the number of years since the Soviet army liberated this place!" I continued, "So, you are nine years old?" He nodded in agreement. He uses the method of remembering his age to firmly remember the liberators of his motherland. He said that he and his classmates often water and plant flowers in front of the tombs of the Soviet army martyrs. Gratitude and friendship towards the Soviet people have indeed been deeply engraved in this child's heart. Throughout Poland, wherever the Soviet army fought, the local people have built memorial towers. In some places, they have also built tombs and erected monuments for each fallen hero. Flowers are constantly placed in front of the tombs throughout the year.
    Currently, on one side of the construction site of the Stalin Palace of Culture and Science, there are still remnants of the walls and ruins of houses that were burned down by the German fascist bandits. Everyone who visits here can see how deep the disaster the fascist bandits brought to Warsaw, and that the Soviet people, after the glorious Soviet army eliminated the fascist bandits and liberated Poland, sent such a precious gift to Warsaw. A Polish technician who accompanied me on the visit pointed to the remaining ruins on the construction site and said to me, "The traces left by these beasts will soon be replaced by precious Soviet gifts!"

    苏波两国人民永恒友情的标志
    ——访华沙“斯大林文化科学宫”建筑工地
    新华社记者  谢文清
    “当你看到市中心有一座正在建造着的高入云层的建筑物时，那你就到达我们的华沙了。”和我同乘飞机离开北京的一位波兰留华女学生知道我要到华沙去，她就这样向我介绍华沙：“那就是华沙文化科学宫，是苏联人民送给波兰人民的礼物，它标志着波、苏两国人民永恒的友情。”七月二十日，当飞机在万里无云的华沙天空慢慢着陆时，我一眼就看见了这座巨大的正在建造着的建筑物。
    华沙文化科学宫是根据斯大林的倡议而由波苏两国政府于一九五二年四月五日在莫斯科签订的协定建造的。文化科学宫的全部建造费用，包括参加建筑工程的波兰工人的工资和劳动保护费用在内，都由苏联方面负担。主要建筑材料如钢筋、水管等，以及全部施工所需的近代化机器，都由苏联供给。文化科学宫的设计，是苏联建筑师们的精心杰作。由苏联建筑科学院院士列·鲁德涅夫所领导的苏联建筑师们，在设计上化费了许多精力，使这座建筑物体现着波兰民族建筑的风格。为了纪念世界劳动人民的伟大导师、波兰人民的最好的朋友斯大林同志，为了纪念苏联人民对波兰人民的兄弟般的帮助，波兰议会和部长会议在今年三月间通过决定，把这座社会主义的建筑物命名为“斯大林文化科学宫”。宫前是占地五万多平方公尺的斯大林广场。
    我曾经三次到文化科学宫的建筑工地参观。但是，每一次参观不仅使我深深地体会到波苏人民之间的深厚友谊的巩固和发展，而且还看见了社会主义建筑科学的高度成就。目前，钢筋骨架已经高达三十层，墙壁装饰和内部装置等已进行到十七层。但在如此广阔的工地上，却看不到多少工人。正像波兰朋友雅妮娜对我所说的：“人很少，但一星期就高出一层。”一位在那里工作的苏联老工人波诺莫莱夫同志对我说：“这个文化科学宫高二百二十公尺，体积为八十万立方公尺。从建筑开始起到现在为止，已用了五十万立方公尺的混凝土、一千三百多万块砖和数万吨钢材。你看！”他指着正在工作着的各式起重机和运输卡车说：“一切材料都是按设计图样制好，然后用自动装车机装上卡车运到工地上来，再用起重机吊起来安装在所需要的地方。”
    这位苏联老工人的话完全不错。我三次在工地上参观，就根本没有看见用人扛、抬、挑的事情，在那里，体力劳动是尽可能地减轻的。那里有十七架电气自动起重机在工作。有苏联本年度出产的能起五吨重的“贝克斯姆”十四型电气起重机。在建筑物的最高的顶端，架设着四部能起十五吨重的“乌贝克”十五型的高空万能起重机。这种起重机不但能把现成的笨重钢材吊到最高一层，而且能把它们安装在需要的地方。它的位置经常保持在建筑物最高一层之上约十公尺。不管建造多么高的房屋均可适用。在这一切依靠机器的工地上，工人“最繁重”的劳动不过是操纵机器，调节电流和接焊钢材、水管等，因此，工地上的女工人数就占全体工人的百分之十五以上。此外，社会主义的建筑技术还保证了建筑工作能在零下四十多度的严寒中丝毫无阻地进行。斯大林文化科学宫的施工，也是不管风天、阴天、雨天、雪天，都昼夜不停地进行的。每天晚上，从华沙各处都可望到“乌贝克”十五型高空万能起重机上闪亮的灯光和电焊管放射出的白色火花。
    斯大林文化科学宫的建造工程，又是波兰建筑工人和技师们最好的学校。波兰工人们在和苏联工人的共同工作中，正在学习和使用着最新的社会主义技术和工作法。目前，在参加施工的全部工人中，波兰工人占三分之一。为了训练出更多的掌握最新技术的波兰工人，参加施工的波兰工人不久将增加到全部施工工人的二分之一。苏联和波兰职工的共同工作体现着两国人民的深情厚谊。苏联技术人员和工人把社会主义的技术和工作法传授给波兰的工人兄弟。例如，不久之前还是农民的波兰工人普·维彩金，现已成为最优秀的工作队长。他领导的工作队采用苏联郭瓦廖夫工作法，超过计划百分之二百五十。波兰工人阿·舍努领导的工作队超过计划百分之二百二十六。像他们这样的优秀工人已经成批成批地涌现出来了。
    每天，波兰各地的工人、农民和学生继续不断地、有组织地到华沙来参观斯大林文化科学宫的建筑工程，为的是要亲自了解这个体现苏联人民对波兰人民的友情和帮助的建筑工程的进展情况。平均每月参观的有上千的人，而在去年十一月的“波苏友好月”中，每天多至三千多人。参观的人回去之后都作了传达。波兰工人叶·普维钦在对我谈到苏联政府和人民对波兰人民各方面的手足般的援助时说：“在反法西斯的战斗中，波、苏人民的子弟在波兰国土上共同流过血；今天，在和平建设中，我们两国的工人又在同一地方共同流着汗。这种传统的友情已深深地刻划在波兰人民的心坎上！”他的话立刻引起了不久前我在波兰各地参观时的一段回忆。那是八月六日在波兰西南部的弗罗茨拉夫城。我在该城的苏军烈士公园中遇见一个名叫格特克的小孩子。当我问他几岁的时候，他回答说：“苏军解放这里有几年，我就有几岁！”我接着说，“那么，你是九岁了？”他同意地点了点头。他是用记忆自己年龄的办法牢记着自己祖国的解放者的。他说他还常常和同学们到苏军阵亡将士的墓前浇水栽花。对苏联人民的感谢和友情，确已深深刻划在这孩子的心坎上了。在波兰全国，凡是有苏军作过战的地方，当地人民都建有纪念塔。有的地方还为每个阵亡的英雄建墓、立碑。墓前，一年四季鲜花不断。
    目前，在斯大林文化科学宫工地上的一边，还残存着一两处被德国法西斯匪徒所焚毁的房屋的残垣断壁。每一个到此参观的人都可以看出：法西斯匪徒给华沙带来了多么深重的灾难，而苏联人民，在光荣的苏联军队消灭了法西斯匪徒和解放了波兰之后，又给华沙送来了这么贵重的礼物。陪我参观的一位波兰技师指着建筑工地上仅存的残垣断壁对我说，“这些野兽留下的残迹不久就要被珍贵的苏联礼品所代替了！”
