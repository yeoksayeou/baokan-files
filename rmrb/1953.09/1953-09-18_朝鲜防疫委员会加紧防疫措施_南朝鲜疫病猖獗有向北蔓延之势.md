Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 17th: The epidemic encephalitis that recently occurred in South Korea is spreading rapidly and is about to spread to the vicinity of the 38th parallel. The National Emergency Anti-Epidemic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held an enlarged meeting on September 12th to decide on emergency anti-epidemic measures.

The National Emergency Anti-Epidemic Committee stipulates that thorough inspection of the epidemic situation should be carried out in cities along important roads, especially in the area of the 38th parallel and the coastal area close to the 38th parallel. The meeting also stipulated various measures for anti-epidemic organizations and anti-epidemic personnel at all levels to strengthen anti-epidemic work, as well as measures to launch mass anti-epidemic and hygiene campaigns among the People's Army troops and local residents.

Li Bingnan, Minister of Public Health of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, recently issued a special statement saying: Encephalitis has occurred in South Korea under the rule of the American and Syngman Rhee gangs and is spreading rapidly to various places. We also remember the fact that the encephalitis that occurred and prevailed in South Korea in 1949 spread to the northern part of the Republic. Therefore, we must now be vigilant to prevent encephalitis from spreading across the border. Li Bingnan said: It is the primary task of all anti-epidemic workers to earnestly protect the people from being attacked by this malignant infectious disease.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 16th: Under the rule of the American and Syngman Rhee gangs, the health situation in South Korea is deteriorating and diseases are rampant.

According to sources in Seoul: The epidemic of summer encephalitis that began at the end of August is becoming more and more rampant. As of September 9th, summer encephalitis has spread to 26 cities and counties in Gyeonggi Province's Seoul and Yangju, North Jeolla Province's Jeonju, Gimje, and Okgu, and South Gyeongsang Province's Busan, Masan, and Dongnae. According to official figures released by the Syngman Rhee gang, the number of people suffering from encephalitis has reached 89, and 14 people were found to have contracted encephalitis on September 8th alone. By September 6th, 23 people had died from encephalitis.

In recent months, smallpox has also been prevalent in various parts of South Korea. According to the South Korean "Peace Daily", more than 800 people have been found to be suffering from smallpox in various cities, of whom 75 have died. In Busan alone, 300 patients have been found. Seventy percent of smallpox patients are infants aged two or three years old, most of whom have not been vaccinated. According to foreign news agencies, 220 out of every 1,000 infants in South Korea die prematurely, which is the highest infant mortality rate in the world.
