    Southwest Region Begins to Strengthen Leadership over Handicraft Industry

    Party and government leading organs and relevant departments in some areas of Southwest China have begun to attach importance to and strengthen leadership over the handicraft industry. Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Luzhou, Zigong and other places have successively carried out the work of adjusting the handicraft industry and have achieved results.

    Before carrying out the adjustment work, most areas conducted investigations and research to understand the situation and problems existing in the local handicraft industry. In the investigation work, in addition to typical household surveys and general surveys, some areas also held forums for handicraft workers, apprentices and handicraft operators to understand the situation. When carrying out the adjustment work, they generally selected key industries first, gained experience, and then adjusted other industries. Most places convened handicraft representative meetings to explain the policies of the Party and the People's Government towards the handicraft industry, and to criticize some erroneous understandings of the handicraft industry.

    Therefore, after the adjustment of the handicraft industry in various places, a new atmosphere has emerged. Many handicraft operators, after clearly understanding the prospects for development, actively engaged in production and operation. For example, after the handicraft representative meeting in Yuanjiang County, Yunnan Province, the blacksmith Bi Hongfu in the Second District took the initiative to sign a contract with the Second District Supply and Marketing Cooperative to process sickles. Some workers and apprentices have also corrected their attitude towards labor and actively learned techniques. Many handicraft owners and apprentices have signed production contracts and master-apprentice contracts, and some entire industries have signed collective contracts or agreements.

    All localities have clearly pointed out that handicraft production must pay attention to improving quality, reducing costs, and implementing the policy of self-production and self-sales. In mid-June, Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, held the second county-wide handicraft representative symposium to specifically study the issue of handicraft production serving the autumn harvest and agricultural production. For handicraft industries that are needed by the masses and have development prospects, the relevant departments of the People's Government provide assistance to solve their difficulties through processing orders, loans, and organizing raw material supply. For some handicraft industries that have no prospects for development, relevant departments are guiding them to switch to other industries. For example, Changshou County in Sichuan is guiding industries that manufacture superstitious items to switch to other industries.

    In terms of the entire region, the work of adjusting the handicraft industry and strengthening production leadership has been done relatively well in large and medium-sized cities, and many counties have made achievements. However, a large number of county party and government leading organs have not attached importance to strengthening leadership over the handicraft industry and have not led the adjustment of the handicraft industry. These shortcomings should be corrected immediately.

### 西南部分地区  开始加强对手工业的领导

    西南部分地区
    开始加强对手工业的领导
    西南部分地区党、政领导机关和有关部门已开始重视和加强对手工业的领导，重庆、成都、昆明、贵阳、泸州、自贡等地，都先后进行了调整手工业的工作，并已取得成绩。
    在进行调整工作之前，大部分地区都进行了调查研究工作，了解当地手工业存在的情况和问题。在调查工作中，除典型户调查和普遍调查外，有的地区还分别召开了手工业工人、学徒和手工业者座谈会，了解情况。在进行调整工作时，一般是先选择重点行业进行，取得经验后，再调整其他行业。各地大都召开了手工业代表会议，交代党和人民政府对手工业的政策，批判一些对手工业的错误认识。
    因此，各地手工业经过调整后，大都出现了新气象，有许多手工业者明确认识发展前途后，积极生产经营。如云南省元江县第二区铁匠毕鸿富在该县手工业代表会议结束后，即主动与第二区供销合作社订立加工镰刀的合同。有些工人、学徒也端正了劳动态度，积极学习技术。不少手工业主和学徒签订了生产合同和师徒合同，也有全行业签订集体合同或协议的。
    各地都明确指出：手工业生产必须重视提高品质，降低成本，贯彻自产自销的方针。云南省宜良县于六月中旬召开了全县第二次手工业代表座谈会，专门研究手工业生产为秋收及农业生产服务的问题。对于群众需要、有发展前途的手工业行业，人民政府有关部门以加工订货、贷款、组织原料供应等，帮助他们解决困难。对于某些没有发展前途的手工业行业，有关部门正指导他们转业。如四川长寿县正指导制造迷信品的行业转业。
    就全区说来，大、中城市调整手工业、加强生产领导的工作作得比较好，不少县份做出了成绩。但还有很大一部分县的党、政领导机关没有重视加强对手工业的领导，没有领导进行手工业的调整工作。这些缺点应即纠正。
