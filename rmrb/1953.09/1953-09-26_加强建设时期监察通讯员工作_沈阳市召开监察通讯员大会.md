Strengthening the Work of Supervisory Correspondents During the Construction Period
Shenyang City Holds Supervisory Correspondents Conference

In order to meet the needs of the national construction period and vigorously carry out the work of people's supervisory correspondents, the Shenyang Municipal People's Supervisory Committee convened the Third Shenyang Municipal People's Supervisory Correspondents Conference on September 3.

In the past six months, the work of supervisory correspondents in Shenyang City has achieved certain results. There are currently 258 supervisory correspondent groups and 1,184 people's supervisory correspondents in the city, a fourfold increase compared to 1952. These supervisory correspondents are distributed among 148 government agencies, factories, mines, and other units. In the first half of this year, the Municipal People's Supervisory Committee received a total of more than 210 pieces of people's supervisory correspondence. These letters exposed major problems in economic construction, such as the Shenyang Municipal Native Produce Company's blindly purchasing frozen and rotten fruits, causing huge losses worth more than 7 billion yuan. When the Shenyang Municipal Trust Company saw a shortage of calculators in the market, it raised prices, causing market price fluctuations and giving speculators an opportunity to disrupt the market. In addition, supervisory correspondents also reported incidents of embezzlement of public funds that occurred in the commercial system. The Shenyang Municipal Supervisory Committee organized inspections based on the above clues and made appropriate handling of these incidents. The court and relevant agencies gave administrative and legal punishments to the derelict and those who violated laws and regulations, respectively.

The meeting affirmed these achievements and pointed out that the following points must be paid attention to in order to do a good job in supervisory correspondence: First, in-depth mobilization of the masses and democratic election of supervisory correspondents are the key to doing a good job in supervisory correspondence. Second, in order to consolidate and improve the enthusiasm of supervisory correspondents, the leadership of each unit must promptly and earnestly handle the opinions reflected by the supervisory correspondents. Third, supervisory correspondents must maintain close ties with the masses, unite the masses, and pay attention to cultivating activists, so that supervisory work can be established on a broad mass basis.

Finally, the meeting heard a report from Sun Liyu, Deputy Mayor of Shenyang City. He pointed out that in the new period of the country's planned economic construction, the task of supervisory correspondents is to supervise and inspect the implementation of various government policies and decrees, and promote the realization of the task of national industrialization and gradual transition to socialist society. In their work, supervisory correspondents must grasp the current key issues, such as paying attention to the issue of increasing production and practicing economy in factories, and paying attention to the issue of financial expenditures in agencies, and fighting against bureaucracy and illegal and disciplinary phenomena. In order to accomplish the above tasks, he called on supervisory correspondents to strengthen the study of political theory and national policies and laws, and improve their working ability.

    加强建设时期监察通讯员工作
    沈阳市召开监察通讯员大会
    为适应国家建设时期的需要，大力开展人民监察通讯员工作，沈阳市人民监察委员会在九月三日召开了第三届全市人民监察通讯员大会。
    半年来，沈阳市监察通讯员工作取得了一定的成绩。全市现有二百五十八个监察通讯小组、一千一百八十四名人民监察通讯员，人数比一九五二年增加了四倍。这些监察通讯员分布在一百四十八个政府机关、厂矿企业等单位中。市人民监察委员会今年上半年共收到二百一十多件人民监察通讯。这些来信揭发了经济建设中的重大问题，如沈阳市土产公司盲目采购冻烂水果，造成价值七十余亿元的巨大损失。沈阳市信托公司出卖计算器时看到市场缺货，便抬高价格，造成市场物价波动，并给奸商扰乱市场以可乘之机。另外，监察通讯员还反映了商业系统中所发生的盗窃公款的事件。沈阳市监察委员会根据上述线索组织了检查，并对这些事件作了适当的处理，法院和有关机关对失职人员和违法乱纪分子，分别给予了行政和法律处分。
    会议肯定了这些成绩，指出要作好监察通讯工作必须注意如下几点：第一、深入发动群众，民主选举监察通讯员，是做好监察通讯工作的关键。第二、为了巩固和提高监察通讯员的积极性，各单位领导方面必须及时认真处理监察通讯员所反映的意见。第三、监察通讯员要密切联系群众，团结群众，注意培养积极分子，使监察工作建立在广泛的群众基础上。
    会议最后听了沈阳市人民政府孙力余副市长的报告。他指出：在国家开始有计划的经济建设的新时期，监察通讯员的任务就是监督和检查政府各项政策、法令的执行，促进国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会的任务的实现。监察通讯员在工作中要抓住当前关键性的问题，如在工厂目前要注意增产节约问题，在机关要注意财政开支问题，与官僚主义和违法乱纪现象做斗争。为了完成上述任务，他号召监察通讯员应加强政治理论和国家政策法令的学习，提高工作能力。
