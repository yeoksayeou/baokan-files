    Incompetent Work at Yibin Special District Farm
    Early Rice Seeds Sold as Medium Rice Seeds
    Zhou Xiaogang, Huang Xialing, and Kang Jirong from the Construction Section of the Gao County People's Government in Sichuan Province write: This February, our county purchased 50 jin of early rice "Nante No. 1" seeds and 100 jin of medium rice "Zhongnong No. 4" seeds from the Yibin Special District Farm. Both types of seeds were properly packaged and came with cultivation instructions. At the time, the "Zhongnong No. 4" seeds were trial-planted by our county's farm and several model laborers. In order to promote improved rice varieties to farmers, the farm sowed and transplanted on time, adopting advanced techniques and meticulous cultivation. However, these "Zhongnong No. 4" seeds universally began to head before developing stalks, just twenty days after transplanting. Due to poor growth and development, there were only five or six plants per seedling, the plants were short, and the ears were short with sparse grains. As a result, these rice paddies on the farm saw a 59% reduction in yield per mu, with the output being much lower than that of ordinary local farmers. Farmers widely complained, saying: "The farm's crops are in terrible shape!" Our county's model laborers Deng Qianzhi and Li Xiaowu, who planted "Zhongnong No. 4" seeds in high-yielding fields, also experienced reduced yields, saying the farm had harmed them.
    Why did this happen? It turned out that the Yibin Special District Farm mixed up the early rice "Nante No. 1" seeds and the medium rice "Zhongnong No. 4" seeds. Our county farm planted the early rice "Nante No. 1" seeds according to the sowing date for medium rice "Zhongnong No. 4," naturally missing the optimal planting time. This careless approach by the Yibin Special District Farm caused undue losses to the production of our county's farm and these model laborers. The Yibin Special District Farm should investigate this issue.

### 宜宾专区农场工作不负责任  错把早稻种当成中稻种出售

    宜宾专区农场工作不负责任
    错把早稻种当成中稻种出售
    四川省高县人民政府建设科周孝刚、黄遐龄、亢吉荣来信：我县今年二月向宜宾专区农场购买早稻“南特号”谷种五十斤，中稻“中农四号”谷种一百斤；两种稻种都是包装完备，并附有栽培说明。当时“中农四号”谷种就分别由我县农场和几个劳动模范试种。农场为了向农民推广优良稻种，就按时播种、插秧，并采用先进技术，精耕细作；可是，这些“中农四号”谷种在栽后二十天还没发棵就普遍抽穗了。由于生长发育不良，每窝只五、六棵，植株矮小，穗短籽稀。结果，农场这些稻田每亩减产百分之五十九，产量比当地一般农民低得多。农民纷纷反映说：农场的庄稼好糟！我县劳动模范邓乾之、李孝武把“中农四号”谷种种在丰产田里，也减了产，说农场害了他们。
    为什么会发生这样的情况呢？原来宜宾专区农场把早稻“南特号”谷种和中稻“中农四号”谷种包错了。我县农场按中稻“中农四号”的播种日期种早稻“南特号”，自然迟误了农时。宜宾专区农场这种粗枝大叶的作风，使我县农场和这几个劳动模范的生产受到不应有的损失。宜宾专区农场应该对这个问题进行检查。
