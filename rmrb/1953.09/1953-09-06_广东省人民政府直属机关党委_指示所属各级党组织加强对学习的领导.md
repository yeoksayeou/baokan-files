    The theoretical study for high and middle-level cadres in organs directly under the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, which began on July 1st, has seen increased emphasis on leadership of learning in various units compared to before. Learning systems have been established, and learning committees have been formed. Most units have assigned full-time cadres to be responsible for leading the learning. Currently, cadres in various units have listened to reports on the first, second, and third sections of Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)."

    However, some problems also exist in the learning process in various units: Some units still do not pay enough attention to the leadership of learning. For example, since the beginning of the study, the general party branch of the Department of Commerce has not conducted thorough arrangements and inspections, so only 50 percent of the middle-level group can conscientiously adhere to the learning. The general party branch of the Department of Health rarely discusses the leadership of middle-level group learning at meetings. The propaganda committee member of the general party branch of the Department of Education also does not pay attention to the leadership of learning. In addition, it has also been found that some cadres are not clear about the purpose and requirements of learning, and there are shortcomings in learning methods. For example, some comrades in the Department of Education get entangled in some nouns and definitions during the learning process. Some comrades do not study the documents carefully, are eager to "link with reality," or attempt to solve many problems at once. The Department of Provincial Cadre School designated too many reference documents, which affected the study of the main documents. The Post and Telecommunications管理局 (Bureau) lacked preparation before organizing discussion sessions, and there was no central focus, resulting in little gain. In addition, it was also found that some comrades are not humble and conscientious in their studies, and individual comrades show complacency and are unwilling to listen to lectures.

    In response to the above situation, the CPC Committee of Organs Directly Under the Guangdong Provincial People's Government issued instructions to party organizations at all levels: First, the purpose of studying Chapters Nine to Twelve of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" is to enable cadres to learn about the theories and experiences of socialist economic construction. It requires understanding how, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) transitioned from war to peaceful economic construction based on new circumstances, realized the transition from the wartime communism policy to the New Economic Policy, launched the work of restoring the national economy, and led the country to a new historical stage of industrialization and agricultural collectivization. Second, party organizations at all levels must complete the leadership of learning as a political task of the party, regard learning as one of the main contents of the branch's work, and include it in the party's work plan; strengthen the party's specific leadership over learning, clarify the division of labor, and the general party branch and branch secretaries must effectively undertake the task of leading learning; unify learning leadership and improve learning groups, to avoid the past tendency of some units pushing learning leadership to the learning committee while lacking specific leadership over the learning committee; strictly implement the reporting system. Third, all units must adhere to the learning system. The learning time is generally six hours per week. If it cannot be adhered to due to special circumstances, it must be reported to the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee for approval. During the study, if it is found that the organization is inappropriate, necessary adjustments should be made.

    广东省人民政府直属机关党委
    指示所属各级党组织加强对学习的领导
    广东省人民政府直属机关高、中级组干部理论学习，自七月一日开始以来，各单位对学习的领导比前重视，建立了学习制度，成立了学委会，多数单位指派专职干部负责领导学习。目前各单位干部已听过了关于“联共（布）党史”第九章第一、二、三节的报告。
    各单位在学习中同时也存在着一些问题：有些单位对学习的领导仍然不够重视。如商业厅党总支自从学习开始以来，没有很好地进行布置与检查，因此中级组能认真地坚持学习的只有百分之五十。卫生厅党总支很少在会议上讨论中级组的学习领导问题。教育厅党总支宣传委员也不重视学习领导。另外，也发现有些干部对学习的目的和要求不明确，在学习方法上有缺点。如教育厅有个别同志，在学习中纠缠于一些名词、定义。有的同志没有认真地学习文件，急于要求“联系实际”，或企图一下解决许多问题。省干部学校指定的参考文件过多，以致影响到对主要文件的学习。邮电管理局在组织讨论会前缺乏准备，没有中心，收获不大。此外，也发现了有些同志学习不虚心、不认真，个别同志表现自满，不愿听课。
    中共广东省人民政府直属机关党委针对上述情况，对各级党的组织发出了指示：一、学习“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章的目的，在于使干部学习有关社会主义经济建设的理论和经验，要求了解联共（布）党在列宁、斯大林领导下，如何根据新的情况，由战争进到和平经济建设的过渡，实现了由战时共产主义政策进到新经济政策的转变，展开了恢复国民经济的工作，把国家引上工业化和农业集体化的新的历史阶段。二、各级党的组织必须把领导学习当作党的政治任务来完成，把学习作为支部工作的主要内容之一，列入党的工作计划；加强党对学习的具体领导，明确分工，党总支、支部书记必须切实把领导学习的任务担当起来；统一学习领导，健全学习小组，以避免过去有些单位把学习领导推给学委会，而又缺乏对学委会作具体领导的偏向；严格执行汇报制度。三、各单位必须坚持学习制度，学习时间一般每周为六小时，如因特殊事故不能坚持时，须报告党委宣传部批准；学习中，如发现编级不适当，应作必要的调整。
