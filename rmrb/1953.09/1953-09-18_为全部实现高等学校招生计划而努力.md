    Strive to Fulfill the Enrollment Plan of All Institutions of Higher Education
    Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of the Central Higher Education Ministry and Deputy Chairman of the National Higher Education Enrollment Committee
    The unified enrollment work for national institutions of higher education for 1953 is coming to an end, and the admission lists will be announced in a few days. Now, I would like to discuss the following issues with the more than 70,000 new students admitted this year, as well as with comrades in relevant departments:
    First, let's talk about the policy of unified enrollment of new students and the principle of planned distribution of new students.
    Why do national institutions of higher education need to conduct unified enrollment? This is because, on the one hand, the country's various construction endeavors urgently need a large number of high-level construction talents, and on the other hand, the number of graduates from senior high schools nationwide is too small. This is a major contradiction. Whether this contradiction can be resolved is a crucial link in whether China's higher education can develop smoothly. The solution to this problem is unified enrollment by national institutions of higher education. This approach has three advantages: First, it can increase the source of students in a planned way. Second, through unified enrollment and the planned distribution of admitted students, it can both ensure the needs of national key construction and appropriately take care of the needs of various construction endeavors. Third, currently, individual school enrollments are prone to deviations such as excessively high demands on students' levels, which are divorced from reality, or excessively lowered admission standards, which affect the quality of cultivating high-level construction talents. Unified enrollment can appropriately ensure the quality of new students.
    The general principle for the planned distribution of new students this year is: first, to meet the country's need for cultivating construction talents, and at the same time, to appropriately consider individual students' aspirations for further education. Specifically: First, distribution should be based on national needs, according to grades, and with reference to the filled-in application preferences. Those who cannot be distributed according to their filled-in preferences will be appropriately distributed to a certain school, department, or major by the National Enrollment Committee, based on the national enrollment plan and with reference to the applicant's conditions. Second, in the distribution, priority should be given to ensuring the completion of the enrollment plans for majors and departments in heavy industry, defense industry, and related fields such as geology and architecture. Special attention should be paid to political quality when allocating students to defense industry schools. Third, the policy of opening higher education to workers and peasants must be earnestly implemented, and appropriate consideration should be given to ethnic minority students and overseas Chinese students. Fourth, in terms of regional allocation, candidates from the North China, Northeast, and Northwest regions, where there are fewer students, should be allocated to schools in their respective regions in principle; among the candidates from the East China, Central South, and Southwest regions, where there are more students, those who apply to the North China, Northeast, and Northwest regions should be allocated to those regions; candidates from the East China, Central South, and Southwest regions should generally not be mutually transferred.
    This year, more than 90,000 people applied, and more than 70,000 new students were admitted. Given this, it seems that the enrollment tasks of each school are easy to complete, but this is not the case. Looking at the first choices filled in by 8,069 applicants in the North China examination area, students' preferences are mostly concentrated in a few schools, a few departments, and a few majors. For example, about 58 percent of students applied for engineering, exceeding the enrollment plan by 16 percent; medicine accounted for about 16 percent, exceeding the enrollment plan by 6 percent; conversely, some departments are severely short and cannot complete the enrollment plan. According to the enrollment plan, in addition to transferring elementary school teachers and normal school graduates for direct advancement, normal schools in the North China region must also enroll 10 percent of students through examination. Currently, only about 3 percent have applied, which is almost 7 percent less than the enrollment plan. In addition, science is also short by 1.76 percent. Although many students apply for engineering, their filled-in preferences are mostly concentrated in a few majors such as "general machinery manufacturing" and "radio engineering and electrical communication." Students applying for civil engineering, geology, and mining are fewer than the enrollment plan. If the situation in all examination areas across the country is the same as in North China, then this year's enrollment plans for each school, each department, and each major will not be fully realized. Therefore, some students will be appropriately allocated according to the national enrollment plan and with reference to their conditions. In order to smoothly complete the 1953 enrollment plan, we hope that all admitted students will correctly understand the relationship between national needs and personal aspirations, consciously obey the state's unified allocation, and happily embark on new learning positions.
    Some students who applied for engineering will be assigned to study geology, mining, and civil engineering. We hope that these students will happily accept the assignment. In terms of our country's construction needs, it is not permissible to fail to complete the enrollment plans for these majors. To develop industry, we need abundant resources. These resources are buried underground. If we do not train thousands of geologists to explore and discover them, we will not be able to find abundant resources for national construction. Once abundant resources are found, people are needed to mine them, which requires us to train a large number of mining engineers. In the establishment and renovation of all factories and mines, basic construction must first be carried out, which requires the training of a large number of civil engineers. With the work of engineers in geology, mining, and civil engineering, heavy industries such as smelting, machinery manufacturing, and chemical industry, as well as general light industry, can develop. All aspects of industrial construction are mutually coordinated, and it is impossible to lack any department. If the number of students applying for geology, mining, and civil engineering this year is less than the original plan, and the state does not make unified allocation, this will have a significant impact on national industrial construction.
    This year, the number of students applying to aviation, ordnance, and other national defense industry colleges is not large either. As everyone knows, only by establishing the necessary defense industry can we effectively defend the security of the motherland and peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, studying at national defense industry colleges is supremely glorious.
    We ask students not only to see the importance of industrial construction but also to see the importance of all construction endeavors of the motherland in a comprehensive way. Here, we ask students to see the importance of higher normal education. As everyone knows, the machine tool manufacturing industry in industry is the foundation of all industries, and higher normal education is the "machine tool factory" in the educational undertaking of creating national construction talents. Now, the People's Government is determined to run higher normal schools well. We hope that students assigned to normal schools will enthusiastically respond to the government's call and accept this glorious learning task.
    We want to emphasize the importance of comprehensive universities. Comprehensive universities are the foundation of single-discipline institutions of higher education and scientific research endeavors. Only by running comprehensive universities well can we cultivate a large number of teachers for basic courses in general institutions of higher education and scientific research talents. Therefore, we call on students assigned to comprehensive universities to enthusiastically go to various departments and majors to study. Especially students assigned to mathematics majors should do so even more. Mathematics is the foundation of industrial education and scientific research work. Without sufficient mathematical talents, industrial education will be difficult to carry out due to the lack of teachers for basic mathematics courses; if young people do not master mathematical knowledge, they cannot become qualified engineers; if mathematics majors cannot be run well, our country's research work in natural sciences and social sciences will also be greatly restricted, and the cultural, scientific, and technological level of the entire country will not be able to improve more quickly.
    We also warmly hope that students will actively participate in specialist courses so that the country can obtain the urgently needed large number of technical talents in a timely manner. Old China left us with very few talents. From 1927 to 1947, the total number of engineering graduates from institutions of higher education was only about 31,000; since liberation, in order to meet the needs of national industrial construction, the number of national higher industrial schools has more than doubled; and more than 20,000 people have already graduated from engineering and participated in national construction work. However, this is still far from the number needed for national industrial construction. This has led to the contradiction between the country's need for a large number of technical talents and the difficulty for institutions of higher education to supply them in a timely manner. If all institutions of higher education run four-year or five-year undergraduate programs, not only will this contradiction not be resolved, but it will greatly expand this contradiction. To resolve this contradiction, in addition to running undergraduate programs to meet the needs of long-term construction talents, it is also necessary to run a certain number of specialist courses. In terms of the needs of national construction, a large number of construction talents will be needed from 1955 to 1956. Only by running specialist courses can we relatively satisfy this demand. Therefore, among the 71,548 new students enrolled in national institutions of higher education in 1953, 26,950 will enter specialist courses, accounting for nearly 38 percent of the total enrollment. That is to say, on average, less than one in three new students will enter a specialist course. Since opening specialist courses to rapidly cultivate various technical talents is the country's most urgent requirement, we believe that students will happily participate in specialist course studies.
    Students consciously obeying the state's unified allocation and reporting for enrollment in a timely manner meets both the requirements of the state and guarantees individual learning opportunities. The reason why it meets the requirements of the state is that various construction endeavors of the country can obtain a large number of construction talents within a certain period of time. At the same time, everyone knows that the construction of school buildings, the allocation of teachers, and the supplementation of equipment in various institutions of higher education are all determined according to the original enrollment plan. If the national enrollment plan is fully realized and all admitted students can consciously obey the unified allocation, the existing human, material, and financial resources of national institutions of higher education can be fully utilized; otherwise, it will create a chaotic situation in which some schools cannot accommodate due to too many applicants, and some schools cannot complete their tasks due to too few applicants. This is not good for the state or for individuals. Therefore, we hope that students can report in a timely manner to avoid delaying learning opportunities and wasting their studies.
    Here, we also ask education administrative departments above the provincial and municipal levels across the country, teachers in senior high schools, and comrades in the Communist Youth League and student federations at all levels to vigorously assist the local higher education enrollment committees in doing a good job in the publicity, education, and organization work during the allocation stage of this year's enrollment work, so as to ensure the full realization of the enrollment plan. First of all, we ask everyone to organize the newly admitted students to participate in report meetings based on the list of newly admitted students in the region announced in the newspapers, and to conduct persuasive education targeting their specific ideological problems. Secondly, we must organize and urge the newly admitted students to report to the designated schools on time as much as possible, assist them in solving the difficulties of transportation and travel expenses for poor students, and call on them to promote the spirit of friendship, love, and mutual assistance, and overcome difficulties in life or other aspects during the journey, so as to smoothly reach their destination. Leading cadres of national institutions of higher education must mobilize all teachers, students, and staff to do a good job in welcoming new students to school. First of all, they must do a good job in the ideological education of new students, especially to make them understand the training goals and importance of the majors they are about to enter, love the majors they are about to study, and try to quickly stabilize their emotions and concentrate on studying. At the same time, appropriate arrangements should be made for the lives of new students, and they should be helped to familiarize themselves with the school environment and various regulations on study and life.
    Finally, we want to say a few words to the candidates who were not admitted this year. First of all, we want to say a few words to the cadres who participated in the examination this time but were not admitted. We believe that their enthusiasm for going to institutions of higher education to learn skills in order to enhance the strength of national construction is very good. The main reason for not being admitted today is that their cultural and scientific level is still relatively low. We hope that they will return to their original organizations, work with peace of mind, and strive to improve their studies, and take the exam again next year. At the same time, we hope that the responsible comrades of the original organizations will support and help them to improve their studies in order to prepare a reserve force for the country to cultivate high-level construction talents. To the high school graduates who participated in the examination this time but were not admitted, we hope that they will continue to improve their studies. Those students who are in poor physical condition should calm down and recuperate or exercise. Again, we would like to say a few words to the social educated youth who were not admitted this time. The reason why they were not admitted is mostly because their level is too poor, a small number of people because their physical condition is poor, and individual ones because they did not complete the necessary certification procedures. We hope that those with poor levels will continue to work hard to improve their studies, those with poor physical condition will pay attention to recuperation or exercise, and those who lack certificates should try to apply to relevant parties in accordance with certain procedures in the future so that they can take the exam next year. The enrollment of institutions of higher education in 1954 will be even more than this year. As long as everyone studies hard, pays attention to good health, and applies for the necessary certificates, there will be opportunities to take the exam next year.
    In order to ensure the timely supply of national construction talents of various kinds, doing a good job in this year's enrollment work is an important step. Let us all strive to successfully complete this year's national higher education enrollment plan!

    为全部实现高等学校招生计划而努力
    中央高等教育部副部长  全国高等学校招生委员会副主任委员  
    曾昭抡
    一九五三年度全国高等学校的统一招生工作快结束了，几天以内就要发榜。现在，我想对今年录取的七万多新生以及有关部门的同志们谈下面几个问题：
    首先来谈谈统一招考新生的方针和有计划地分配新生的原则。
    为什么全国高等学校要统一招生呢？这是因为一方面目前国家各种建设事业迫切需要大量的高级建设人才，一方面全国高级中学的毕业生数量太少，这是一个很大的矛盾。能不能解决这个矛盾，是我国高等教育事业能否顺利发展的重要环节。而解决这个问题的办法就是全国高等学校统一招考。这种作法的好处有三点：第一，可以有计划地增加学生来源。第二，通过统一招考和有计划地分配录取的新生，既可保证国家重点建设的需要，同时也可适当地照顾各种建设事业的需要。第三，在目前，个别学校招生，容易产生对学生程度要求太高而脱离实际，或是过分降低录取标准而影响培养高级建设人才的质量的偏向。通过统一招生，则可以适当地保证招收新生的质量。
    今年有计划地分配新生的总原则是：首先满足国家培养建设人才的需要，同时适当地照顾个人的升学志愿。具体来说：第一，要根据国家需要，按成绩等第，参照所填志愿来进行分配；未能依所填志愿分配的，由全国招生委员会根据国家招生计划，参照报考学生条件，适当地分配到一定学校的一定科系和专业。第二，在分配时，首先要求保证重工业、国防工业及与此密切相关的地质、建筑等方面的科系和专业的招生计划的完成。在给国防工业等学校分配学生时，应特别注意政治质量。第三，要切实贯彻高等学校向工农开门的方针，并适当地照顾少数民族学生和华侨学生。第四，在地区调配方面，学生少的华北、东北和西北区的考生，以分配入本区学校为原则；学生多的华东、中南和西南区考生当中，报考华北、东北、西北区的，分配到各该区；华东、中南、西南区考生原则上不得互调。
    今年共有九万多人报考，而录取的新生为七万多人。既然如此，似乎各个学校的招生任务是容易完成的，其实不然。从华北考区八千零六十九名报考学生所填的第一志愿来看，同学们的志愿大都集中在几个学校，几个科系，几个专业。例如，报考工科的同学约百分之五十八，超过招生计划百分之十六；医科约占百分之十六，超过招生计划百分之六；反之，有些科系却又缺得很多，不能完成招生计划。根据招生计划，华北区师范学校除了抽调小学教师和师范学校毕业生直接升学外，尚须招考百分之十的学生，现在报考的仅有百分之三左右，即比招生计划差不多要少百分之七。此外理科也缺少百分之一点七六。报考工科的学生虽然很多，但所填志愿多数集中于“普通机械制造”及“无线电工学与电气通讯”等几个专业。而报考土木建筑、地质、采矿等专业的同学，则又少于招生计划。假如全国各个考区都和华北的情况一样，那末，今年各个学校、各个科系、各个专业的招生计划，将不能全部实现。因此，有一部分同学将要按照国家招生计划，参照本人条件，适当地予以分配。为着顺利地完成一九五三年度的招生计划，我们希望全体录取的同学正确地认识国家需要和个人志愿的关系，自觉地服从国家的统一分配，愉快地走上新的学习岗位。
    一部分报考工科的同学，将要分配到地质、采矿、土木建筑专业去学习。我们希望这部分同学能够愉快地服从分配。就我们国家建设的需要来说，不完成这些专业的招生计划是不允许的。要发展工业就需要有丰富的资源，这些资源都埋藏在地下，假如不培养成千上万的地质工程师去勘探发现，我们就无法为国家建设找到丰富的资源。找到了丰富的资源，还要有人去开采，这就要求我们培养大量的采矿工程师。在一切工厂、矿山的开设和改建中，首先要进行基本建设，这就需要培养大量的土木建筑工程师。有了地质、采矿和土木建筑等部门工程师的工作，冶炼、机器制造、化工等重工业和一般轻工业才能发展起来。工业建设的各个方面都是互相配合的，缺少一个部门就不行。假使今年报考地质、采矿、土木建筑等专业的同学不足原定计划，而国家又不作统一调配，这将对国家工业建设发生重大的影响。
    今年报考航空、兵工等国防工业学院的同学也不算多。而大家知道，只有建立起必要的国防工业，才能有效地保卫祖国的安全和远东与全世界的和平。因之到国防工业学院学习，是无上光荣的。
    我们要求同学们不但要看到工业建设的重要性，并且必须全面地看到祖国各种建设事业的重要性。这里我们要求同学们要看到高等师范教育的重要性。大家知道，工业中的母机制造工业是一切工业的基础，而高等师范则是造就国家建设人才的教育事业中的“母机工厂”。现在人民政府决心办好高等师范学校，我们希望分配到师范去的同学们热烈响应政府的号召，接受这一光荣的学习任务。
    我们要着重说一下综合大学的重要性。综合大学是单科性高等学校和科学研究事业的基础。只有办好综合大学，才能大量地培养一般高等学校的基础课的师资和科学研究人才。因此，我们号召分配到综合大学去的同学们，热情地到各科系和专业去学习。尤其分配到数学专业的同学，更应该这样。数学是工业教育和科学研究工作的基础，没有足够的数学人才，工业教育就因缺乏数学基础课的师资而难于进行；如果青年们不掌握数学知识，就不能成为合格的工程师；如果不能办好数学专业，我国自然科学和社会科学的研究工作，也就会受到极大的限制，整个国家的文化科学技术水平就无法更快地提高。
    我们也热烈地希望同学们踊跃地参加专修科的学习，使国家能够及时得到迫切需要的大量的技术人才。旧中国留给我们的人才是很少的。自一九二七年至一九四七年这二十年间，高等学校的工科毕业生总共只有三万一千人左右；而从解放以来，为了适应国家工业建设的需要，全国高等工业学校发展了两倍多；并且已有二万多人从工科毕业，参加了国家建设工作。但是，这和国家工业建设所需要的数量来比，还相差很远。这就发生了国家需要大量技术人才，而高等学校难于及时供应的矛盾。假使高等学校都办四年制或五年制本科的话，不但不能解决这个矛盾，而且会大大扩大这个矛盾。要解决这个矛盾，除了办理本科以解决长期建设的人才的需要外，还须要办理一定数量的专修科。就国家建设的需要来说，一九五五年到一九五六年都需要大量的建设人才，只有办理专修科，才能相对地满足这个要求。因此，一九五三年度全国高等学校招收的七万一千五百四十八名新生，就有二万六千九百五十人要进入专修科，计占招生总数百分之三十八弱，也就是说，平均不到三个新生中就有一个人要入专修科。开办专修科以迅速培养各项技术人才既然是国家最迫切的要求，我们相信同学们一定会愉快地参加专修科学习的。
    同学们自觉地服从国家统一分配，及时报到入学，这既符合国家的要求，也保证了个人学习的机会。说它是符合国家的要求，道理就在于国家的各种建设事业在一定时间内都能够得到大批的建设人才。同时，大家知道，各高等学校的校舍修建、师资配备、设备补充，都是根据原定招生计划来确定的，如果国家招生计划全部实现，全体录取同学都能够自觉地服从统一分配的话，就可以充分发挥全国高等学校现有的人力、物力和财力的作用；否则，就会产生有的学校因报考人数太多而容纳不了，有的学校因报考的人数太少而完不成任务的混乱现象。这不论对国家、对个人都是不好的。因此，希望同学们能够及时报到，免得贻误学习机会，荒废学业。
    这里，我们也要求全国各个省市以上教育行政部门和高级中学的教师同志们、各级青年团和学联的同志们大力协助各地高等学校招生委员会，做好今年招生工作分配阶段的宣传教育和组织工作，以便保证全部实现招生计划。首先要求大家根据报纸公布的本地区被录取的新生名单，组织他们参加报告会，针对他们的具体思想问题，进行说服教育。其次，要尽可能地组织和督促被录取的新生按时到指定的学校去报到入学，协助他们解决交通工具和贫苦同学的旅费困难，号召他们发扬友爱互助的精神，克服旅途中生活上的或其他方面的困难，以便顺利地到达目的地。全国高等学校负责干部，要动员全校师生员工做好迎接新生入学工作，首先要做好新生的思想教育工作，尤其要使他们了解所要入的专业的培养目标及其重要性，爱好自己将要学习的专业，尽量使他们的情绪迅速地安定下来，专心学习。同时，要对新生的生活作适当安排，帮助他们熟悉学校环境和学习上、生活上的各种规章。
    最后，我们要向今年没有被录取的考生讲几句话。首先要对这次参加报考而未被录取的在职干部同志们谈几句话。我们认为他们这种为增强祖国建设力量而要到高等学校去学习本领的热情是很好的。今天未被录取的主要原因是他们的文化科学水平还比较低。希望他们回到原机关，一面安心工作，一面努力进修，明年再来报考。同时，我们希望原机关的负责同志支持和帮助他们进修，以便替国家培养高级建设人才准备后备力量。这次参加报考而未被录取的高中毕业同学，我们希望他们继续进修，那些体格较差的同学，应该静心疗养或锻炼。再次，我们向这次未被录取的社会知识青年说几句话。他们未被录取的原因，多数因为程度太差，少部分人是因为体格较差，个别的是因为没有办好必要的证件手续。我们希望程度差的要继续努力进修，体格差的注意疗养或锻炼，缺乏证件的人今后要设法按照一定的手续向有关方面去申请，以便明年报考。一九五四年高等学校招生比今年更要多些，只要大家好好学习，注意搞好健康，申请到必要的证件，明年都有报考的机会。
    为着保证及时供应国家各种建设人才的需要，做好今年招生工作是重要的步骤之一。让我们大家为胜利地全部完成今年全国高等学校招生计划而努力吧！
