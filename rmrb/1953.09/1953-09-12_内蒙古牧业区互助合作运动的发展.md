The mutual aid and cooperation movement in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas has greatly developed in recent years under the leadership and promotion of the Communist Party and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,600 various types of animal husbandry production mutual aid groups have been organized in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, including Hulunbuir League, Jirem League, Chahar League, Xilin Gol League, and Hinggan League. In the New Barag Right Banner of Hulunbuir League, last winter, herders participating in disaster prevention mutual aid groups accounted for 96 percent of the banner's total nomadic households.

At present, the forms of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas can be roughly divided into three types. One is the seasonal mutual aid group, which is organized according to the production season and needs of preventing snowstorms, lambing, shearing, wolf hunting, haymaking, going to "Aoter" (grazing in places with good water and grass), and sideline production. After the production task is completed, they graze separately again. This type of mutual aid group is the most numerous. The second type is the joint grazing mutual aid group, which is mostly found in pastoral areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas with fewer livestock. The characteristic is that it focuses on mutual assistance in livestock grazing, adopting methods such as rotational grazing or dedicated grazing. This can save labor and prevent herders with fewer livestock from being occupied by a small number of livestock. As a result, manpower can be freed up for sideline production and increased income. This type of mutual aid group can often persist throughout the year and is quite common in pastoral areas. The third type is a more advanced mutual aid group with a certain division of labor and a production plan. These types of mutual aid groups are still very few in number. There are the Huhele Tai mutual aid group in Hulunbuir League, the Erdun Aoqi'er mutual aid group in Hinggan League, the Dere Shen'ai Li mutual aid group in Jirem League, and the Temuer mutual aid group in Xilin Gol League. Because these mutual aid groups can carry out reasonable division of labor according to the production plan and implement mutual assistance in many aspects throughout the year, although the number is small, the good influence in the pastoral area is very large.

The mutual aid and cooperation movement in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas has developed based on the needs of the vast number of herdsmen in production and on the basis of the masses' inherent labor mutual assistance. The characteristics of the pastoral area are vast land and sparse population, lack of labor, and the threat of snowstorms, wolves, and other disasters (such as epidemics) every year in animal husbandry production. Poor herdsmen also lack production tools such as yurts, vehicles, and horses for grazing livestock. Under these circumstances, to overcome difficulties and develop production, it is necessary to organize mutual assistance. On the other hand, among the Mongolian herdsmen, they have had various types of labor mutual assistance forms for hundreds of years due to production needs. Such as Hurqi (joint grazing), Hote (mutual grazing within a residential unit), and Shaoerqi (an organization for mutual assistance to prevent natural disasters) are all mutual aid forms commonly used by the vast number of herdsmen. In Xilin Gol League, Chahar League, and other places, because herdsmen have to haul salt or engage in other sideline production every year, they also have customary mutual assistance in vehicles, livestock, and manpower. These inherent labor mutual assistance forms among herdsmen, although still relatively primitive, are a good foundation for the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas.

Although laboring herdsmen have the need for mutual aid and cooperation in production and have their own inherent forms of labor mutual assistance, without the active advocacy and support of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the pastoral areas would not have been able to develop to its current scale in just a few years. In 1948, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region formulated a policy of preserving the pastoralist economy, "no struggle, no division, no class division," and advocated and promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the pastoral areas based on the actual situation and economic characteristics of animal husbandry; but it must be very prudent and cautious, and the forms and contents of mutual aid and cooperation must be determined according to the characteristics of the pastoral areas. After this, leading cadres of party and government at all levels in Inner Mongolia specifically studied the production situation of the people in the pastoral areas. On the one hand, they learned that the vast number of people in the pastoral areas had the need to organize and generally had the requirements for mutual aid and cooperation. At the same time, they also learned that there were various types of mutual aid forms among the Mongolian herdsmen. Based on these circumstances, the Inner Mongolia Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party clearly pointed out in 1949 that the mutual aid and cooperation of joint grazing in the herding of herdsmen "is a method that can be advocated in the future in organizing herdsmen's cooperation and mutual assistance" and should be promoted. In 1950, the Inner Mongolia Branch Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed at the cadre meeting of the Xilin Gol and Chahar Leagues that "appropriate organization of herdsmen's production cooperation should be carried out to solve difficulties such as insufficient labor and prevention of natural disasters." In addition, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government provided material assistance. For example, in 1950, it lent 7,000 ewes to poor herdsmen in Hulunbuir League. The Huhele Tai mutual aid group, an advanced mutual aid group in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas, was organized by four poor herdsmen who received government loans at that time. All these facts show that the reason why the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas can develop to its current scale today and become a new form of production organization in animal husbandry production is inseparable from the active advocacy and support of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government.

The results of promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas in recent years have demonstrated its superiority. It has brought practical benefits to the herdsmen. This is first manifested in solving the difficulties of insufficient labor and production tools and effectively preventing natural disasters. For example, in a blizzard in New Barag Right Banner of Hulunbuir League in 1949, 12,000 livestock died, but since everyone actively participated in disaster prevention mutual aid organizations, in the ten major snowstorms in the winter of 1951 and the spring of 1952, the banner lost only 700 livestock. Three households of herders, such as Sajingga, in Boged Aola Sumu (district) of the banner, organized a disaster prevention mutual aid group in the winter of 1950, and cooperated in using vehicles, yurts, and pens, and made windbreak walls and sheepfolds in advance. As a result, they did not suffer any losses in the two-day and two-night blizzard, while herdsman Nashun in the same Sumu, because he did not participate in the mutual aid group, was weak and unable to resist the wind and snow, and seventy livestock were crushed to death by snow in one night.

Secondly, it has improved the reproduction rate of livestock and the survival rate of young animals. For example, the Hulunbuir League pastoral area has widely mobilized and organized lambing mutual aid, which has increased the survival rate of young animals year by year. The survival rate of young animals in the pastoral area of the league was 92.5 percent in 1950, 95.45 percent in 1951, and 97 percent in 1952. The Dere Shen'ai Li mutual aid group in Jirem League, in 1952, all 144 young animals bred survived, and the total number of livestock in the group increased by 27.7 percent compared with 1951. The Baladen joint grazing mutual aid group of the Sixth Zuo (district) of the Western United Banner of Xilin Gol League, in 1952, the reproduction rate of sheep reached 121 percent, and the reproduction rate of goats reached 126 percent (due to good feeding management, the twin lamb rate of both sheep and goats reached more than 20 percent), and the survival rate of sheep and goat lambs was 100 percent, with no losses.

Third, it has initially solved the difficulty of organizing settled nomadism and improved grazing techniques. Because the vast majority of Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas are nomadic areas, gradually moving towards settled nomadism through mutual aid and cooperation is an important step to change the face of the people's lives in the pastoral areas and achieve prosperity for both people and livestock. From the herdsmen's mutual aid production in recent years, it can be seen that as long as the herdsmen can be organized, the difficulties in settled nomadism can be gradually overcome. For example, Qiqige Hote in the Western United Banner of Xilin Gol League (this is a mutual aid organization in a residential unit with female youth league member Qiqige as the leading backbone), has a total of nine herder households, thirty people, sixteen laborers, twelve yurts, forty-seven wooden carts, and twenty-three willow fences, and livestock including forty-six horses, two hundred and thirty-two cattle, and nine hundred and fifteen sheep. From the autumn of 1951, Qiqige led the laborers of each herder household to organize and go to Aoter, and the livestock ate very fat and strong. In the winter of 1951, an old man named Man Ga, the old couple of Tegusi, and Zhambula's wife were left in the winter camp with kang, and Ulahu's sick wife and Dali Zabu's wife were sent to Beizi Temple, where the League People's Government was located, for treatment. All the livestock of the Hote were taken to Aoter far away by four strong and healthy laborers, and they migrated from November 1951 until March 1952 before returning to lamb. From here, it can be seen that Qiqige Hote's practice is already a prototype of settled nomadism. This allows the sick to be treated, the old people without labor to rest, and the livestock to graze and eat good grass. In 1952, the livestock (horses, cattle, sheep) reproduction rate of Qiqige Hote reached 103 percent. Of the two hundred and two young animals born, only one was lost due to illness, and the survival rate reached 99.5 percent. There are many such mutual aid organizations in the Second Zuo of the Eastern United Banner of Xilin Gol League and the Taipusi Left Banner of Chahar League.

In general, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has advocated and promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the pastoral areas in recent years, which has made the vast number of herdsmen experience the benefits of being organized. In the better mutual aid groups, they have initially developed the habit of collective labor and improved their political awareness. In the patriotic livestock increasing competition movement, mutual aid groups can generally play a backbone and advanced role, thus improving the patriotic production enthusiasm of the masses.

The above-mentioned achievements in promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas are inseparable from adhering to the correct policy over the years. The main policies are as follows:

1.  Widely publicize the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation among laboring herdsmen, and develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement among herdsmen steadily, rather slow than chaotic. Starting from the production needs of the herdsmen, and according to the habits of the herdsmen, various forms are allowed; implement the spirit of from small to large, from low-level to high-level, from simple to complex. And focus on organizing herdsmen's mutual aid and cooperation in disaster prevention and lambing, organizing settled nomadism and sideline production. Furthermore, pilot the establishment of higher-level animal husbandry production mutual aid organizations in a guided and focused manner to gain experience.
2.  Firmly and unswervingly implement the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and oppose any coercive commandism.
3.  Strengthen the organizational leadership of mutual aid groups, try to combine mutual aid groups with supply and marketing cooperatives, combine them with improving grazing techniques, and provide appropriate material assistance.

The promotion of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas in recent years has not been smooth sailing. Not only have deviations occurred in the past, but there are still some problems that have not been well resolved. For example, in the past, there were tendencies of coercive commandism in various places. Some areas in Jirem League forced herdsmen to combine livestock into groups, and some areas in Hulunbuir League forced herdsmen to divide livestock into groups, and even forced large groups of livestock to graze together regardless of the production characteristics of the nomadic areas. Although these deviations were discovered and corrected by the leadership in a timely manner, they did cause a lot of concerns among the herdsmen. In contrast, there are also some cadres who, under the pretext of being afraid of making mistakes of mechanically copying, do not seriously and steadily organize herdsmen's mutual aid and cooperation, but let it go its own way, thus hindering the development of mutual aid organizations. Among the problems that have not been well resolved, there are mainly two. One is that even now, some cadres in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas have not clearly distinguished the policy of benefiting both herdsmen and herdowners from the policy of mutual aid and cooperation. They still cannot understand very well that although these two policies are aimed at developing animal husbandry production, they must be different when implemented, that is, when dealing with the relationship between herdowners and hired laborers, suruk households, and poor herder households, the policy of benefiting both herdsmen and herdowners must be used to resolve it, otherwise one party will suffer and affect production. However, when solving the relationship between laboring herdsmen in production, we advocate and develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, because only by organizing the vast number of laboring herdsmen can livestock be increased rapidly and massively, and improvements in living can be obtained. Another problem is that compared with agricultural areas, it is not very clear what differences there should be in the specific practices of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in pastoral areas. The road to organizing in agricultural areas is very clear. That is, from temporary seasonal mutual aid to year-round mutual aid, to production cooperatives, to collective farms. In pastoral areas, due to the special circumstances, it is obvious that the road taken in agricultural areas cannot be exactly the same, but it is still not fully resolved what special forms should be passed through to transition to modernization and collectivization. All these problems need to be gradually resolved in future practice.

    内蒙古牧业区互助合作运动的发展
    程海洲
    内蒙古牧业区的互助合作运动，几年来在共产党和内蒙古自治区人民政府的领导与推动下，已有很大发展。根据不完全的统计，在内蒙古自治区呼纳盟、昭乌达盟、察哈尔盟、锡林郭勒盟、兴安盟等牧业区内，已组织起各种类型的畜牧业生产互助小组二千六百多个，在呼纳盟新巴尔虎右翼旗，去年冬季参加防灾互助组的牧民，占全旗总游牧户的百分之九十六。
    目前内蒙古牧业区互助合作组织的形式，大体可分三种。一种是季节性的互助组，它是按照防止风雪灾害、接羔、剪毛、打狼、打草、走“敖特尔”（到有好水草的地方放牧）和副业生产等生产季节和生产需要组织起来的。生产任务完了就又各自放牧。这种互助组的数量最多。一种是合群放牧互助组，这种互助组多在牲畜较少的牧区和半农半牧区，特点是着重于牲畜放牧上的互助，采取轮流放牧或专人放牧等办法；这样可以节省劳力，使牲畜少的牧户不被少数牲畜占去全部精力，因之可以抽出人力进行副业生产，增加收入；这种互助组多能常年坚持不散，在牧区相当普遍。再一种是有一定分工和有生产计划的较高级的互助组，这类互助组现在还为数很少，在呼纳盟有胡和勒泰互助组，在兴安盟有额尔敦敖其尔互助组，在昭乌达盟有德热申爱里互助组，在锡林郭勒盟有特木尔互助组等。这些互助组由于能按照生产计划进行合理分工，常年地在多方面实行互助，虽然为数不多，在牧区发生的良好影响是很大的。
    内蒙古牧业区的互助合作运动，是根据广大牧民生产上的需要和在群众固有的劳动互助的基础上发展起来的。牧业区的特点是地广人稀，劳动力缺乏，再加之在牧业生产中，年年有风雪灾害，而且一年四季有狼害和其他灾害（如疫病等）的威胁，穷苦牧民又缺乏放牧牲畜用的蒙古包、车辆、马匹等生产工具，在这种情况下，要想克服困难，发展生产，就必须组织起来进行互助。另一方面，在蒙族牧民中，数百年来因生产上的需要，他们曾经有各种类型的劳动互助形式。如呼尔其（合群放牧）、浩特（在一个居住单位内互助放牧）、绍尔奇（为了防止自然灾害进行互助的组织）等，都是广大牧民所习惯采用的互助形式。在锡林郭勒盟、察哈尔盟等地，由于牧民年年要拉盐或搞其他副业生产，在车辆、畜力和人力上也都有习惯上的互助。牧民中的这些固有的劳动互助形式，虽然还较原始，但对于内蒙古牧业区互助合作运动的发展来说，却是很好的基础。
    尽管劳动牧民在生产中有互助合作的需要，并且有着自己固有的劳动互助形式，但如果没有中共内蒙古党委和内蒙古自治区人民政府的积极倡导和扶植，牧业区的互助合作运动是不可能在短短几年中发展到今天这种规模的。内蒙古自治区在一九四八年根据牧业区的实际情况与畜牧业经济特点，制订了保存牧主经济、“不斗不分，不划阶级”的政策，并提倡与推行牧业区的互助合作运动；但需要十分稳重与谨慎，必须根据牧业区的特点来规定互助合作的形式与内容。在此以后，内蒙古各级党政负责干部具体地研究了牧业区人民的生产情况，一方面了解到牧业区广大人民有组织起来的需要，普遍有互助合作的要求，同时也了解到在蒙族牧民中原来就存在着各种类型的互助形式。根据这些情况，中国共产党内蒙古工作委员会在一九四九年明确指出牧民放牧中合群放牧的互助合作“是将来在组织牧民合作互助上可以提倡的一种办法”，应加以推广。一九五○年中共中央内蒙古分局在所召集的锡、察盟干部会议上又提出“要适当组织牧民的生产合作，以解决劳力不足及防止自然灾害等困难”的号召；除此以外，内蒙古自治区人民政府并从物质上加以扶助。如一九五○年即在呼纳盟贷给贫苦牧民七千只母羊，现在内蒙古牧业区的先进互助小组胡和勒泰互助组，就是由当时四户得到政府贷羊的贫苦牧民组织起来的。所有这些事实，都说明现在内蒙古牧业区的互助合作运动所以能够发展到今天这种规模，成为畜牧业生产中的一种新的生产组织形式，是与中国共产党内蒙古党委和内蒙古自治区人民政府的积极倡导和扶植分不开的。
    内蒙古牧业区几年来推行互助合作运动的结果，已经显示了它的优越性。它给牧民带来了实际利益。这首先表现在解决了劳动力、生产工具不足的困难和有效地防止了自然灾害等方面。如呼纳盟新巴尔虎右翼旗在一九四九年的一次暴风雪中，曾死亡了一万二千头牲畜，但自从大家积极参加防灾互助组织以后，在一九五一年冬季和一九五二年春季的十次大风雪中，全旗仅损失七百头牲畜。该旗博格德敖拉苏木（区）牧民沙金嘎等三户，一九五○年冬季组织防灾互助组，把车辆、蒙古包、圈棚等合作使用，预先做好防风墙和羊圈，因而在两昼夜的暴风雪中没有一点损失，而同一苏木的牧民那顺，因未参加互助组，人力单薄，不能抵御风雪，一夜被雪压死七十头牲畜。
    其次是提高了牲畜的繁殖率和幼畜的成活率。如呼纳盟牧业区由于广泛地发动和组织了接羔互助，已使幼畜的成活率逐年提高。该盟牧业区一九五○年幼畜成活率为百分之九十二点五，一九五一年提高到百分之九十五点四五，一九五二年提高到百分之九十七。昭乌达盟德热申爱里互助组，一九五二年繁殖的一百四十四头幼畜，全部成活，全组牲畜比一九五一年增加了百分之二十七点七。锡林郭勒盟西部联合旗第六佐（区）巴拉登合群放牧互助组，一九五二年绵羊的繁殖率达到百分之一百二十一，山羊达到百分之一百二十六（由于饲养管理得好，绵、山羊的双羔率都达到了百分之二十以上），绵、山羊羔的成活率均为百分之百，无一损失。
    第三，初步解决了组织定居游牧的困难，改进了放牧技术。由于内蒙古牧业区绝大部分是游牧区，因之经过互助合作逐渐走向定居游牧，是达到改变牧业区人民的生活面貌和达到人畜两旺的重要步骤。从这几年的牧民互助生产中，已经可以看出：只要牧民能够组织起来是可以逐步克服定居游牧中的困难的。如锡林郭勒盟西部联合旗其其格浩特（这是以女青年团员其其格为领导骨干的居住单位的互助组织），共有九户牧民，三十人，十六个劳动力，十二个蒙古包，四十七辆木车和二十三块柳条笆，牲畜计有四十六匹马，二百三十二头牛，九百一十五只羊；从一九五一年秋天起，由其其格带领各牧户的劳动力组织起来走敖特尔，牲畜吃得很肥壮。一九五一年冬季即把一个叫满嘎的老人、特古斯老两口子和占布拉的爱人留在有火炕的冬营地，并把有病的乌拉呼的爱人与大力札布的爱人送到了盟人民政府所在地贝子庙去治病。全浩特的牲畜由四个身强力壮的整劳动力带着到远处走敖特尔，从一九五一年十一月一直游牧到一九五二年三月份才回来接羔。从这里可以看到，其其格浩特的做法，已经是定居游牧的雏型了。这样就使得有病的治了病，无劳动力的老人得到了休息，牲畜游牧吃到了好草。其其格浩特一九五二年牲畜（马、牛、羊）的繁殖率达到百分之一百零三，生下来的二百零二个幼畜只因病损失了一个，成活率达到百分之九十九点五。像这样的互助组织在锡林郭勒盟东部联合旗第二佐和察哈尔盟的太朴寺左旗都有很多。
    总起来讲，内蒙古自治区由于几年来在牧区倡导和推行了互助合作运动，已使广大牧民体验到组织起来的好处，在较好的互助组内并初步养成了集体劳动的习惯，提高了政治觉悟。而在爱国增畜竞赛运动中，互助组一般都能起骨干和先进作用，因之提高了群众的爱国生产热情。
    内蒙古牧业区在推行互助合作运动中所以能够获得上述成绩，是与几年来一直坚持正确的方针分不开的。方针主要有下列三条：
    一、在劳动牧民中广泛宣传互助合作的好处，宁慢勿乱地、稳步地发展牧民中的互助合作运动。从牧民的生产需要出发，根据牧民的习惯，允许有多种多样的形式；贯彻由小到大，由低级到高级，由简单到复杂的精神。并且把组织牧民互助合作的重点放在防灾接羔、组织定居游牧和副业生产上面。再就是有领导和有重点地试办较高级的牧业生产互助组织，以便取得经验。
    二、坚定不移地贯彻自愿互利的原则，反对任何的强迫命令作法。
    三、加强对互助组的组织领导工作，尽量使互助组与供销合作社相结合，与改进放牧技术相结合，并给予适当的物质上的扶助。
    内蒙古牧业区几年来在推行互助合作运动中，并不是一帆风顺的。不但在过去曾经发生过偏差，而且至今还存在着一些问题尚未得到很好解决。比如过去在各地曾经发生强迫命令的偏向，昭乌达盟有的地区曾经强迫牧民把牲畜合群，呼纳盟有的地区曾经强迫牧民把牲畜分群，甚至有的不顾游牧区的生产特点而强迫把大群牲畜组织在一起放牧。这些偏向虽经领导上发现后都及时纠正了，但因此也确实引起了牧民的很多顾虑。与此相反，也有另外一些干部，他们借口怕犯生搬硬套的错误，不去认真稳步地组织牧民的互助合作，而任其自流，因而使互助组织的发展受到阻碍。在尚未得到很好解决的问题中，主要有两个。一个是至今在内蒙古牧业区还有一些干部，对牧工、牧主两利政策与互助合作政策划不清界限，他们还不能够很好地了解，虽然这两个政策都是为了发展畜牧业生产，但执行起来必须有所区别，那就是在处理牧主与雇工、苏鲁克户以及贫苦牧户间的关系时，必须是用牧工、牧主两利政策来解决，不然必有一方会吃亏而影响生产；但当解决劳动牧民间在生产中的关系时，我们是提倡和发展互助合作运动的，因为广大的劳动牧民只有组织起来才可能迅速地和大量地增加牲畜，获得生活的改善。另一个问题是牧业区的互助合作运动与农业区比较起来，在具体作法上应该有那些不同，尚不十分明确。在农业区组织起来的道路是很清楚的。那就是由临时的季节性的互助到常年互助，到生产合作社，到集体农庄。在牧业区，由于情况特殊，很明显不能与农业区所走的道路完全一样，但到底应该经过那些特殊的形式过渡到现代化与集体化，则还是尚未完全解决的问题。所有这些问题，都需要在今后的实践中逐步求得解决。
