CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee Holds Basic Construction Work Conference
Determines Completion of State Plan on the Basis of Ensuring Project Quality

[Reported by this newspaper] The CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee convened a basic construction work conference in mid-August, focusing on inspecting the quality of basic construction projects in the first half of the year. The conference determined that the primary task of basic construction in the province for the second half of the year is to complete the state construction plan on the basis of ensuring and improving project quality.

The conference concentrated on inspecting the quality of basic construction projects in various locations. Judging from the 30 percent of projects that have been completed across the province, the quality of some projects is relatively good, but many major projects do not meet quality standards, and some have even experienced serious quality accidents. For example, the cotton cleaning room project of the Jinhua Textile Factory undertaken by the Fourth Construction District of the Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Company, the Fenhe Highway Bridge project constructed by the Taiyuan Municipal Construction Engineering Company, and the factory building project of the 8301 construction area undertaken by the Third Engineering Department of the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry, all experienced quality accidents. These accidents not only directly caused huge losses in manpower and materials but also delayed the progress of the projects and seriously shortened the service life of the buildings and equipment. The conference believes that this is the result of failing to establish a unified concept of good, fast, and economical, and insufficient attention is still being paid to project quality.

Therefore, the conference believes: First, a mass movement for quality inspection must be launched. Through inspection, identify shortcomings in technical management and establish a technical responsibility system to ensure project quality in response to these shortcomings. To make the technical responsibility system easy to inspect and implement, clear quality standards must also be stipulated, a leadership work system established, and a technical person-in-charge system and a daily and hourly quality inspection system implemented. Second, on-site leadership must be strengthened. All units must tighten construction districts and assign cadres to construction sites to take on practical work. A determination must be made to reduce the administrative work of technical personnel, give full play to their technical effectiveness, do a good job in technical management, improve the technical level of workers, and ensure project quality. Third, a preliminary construction operation plan must be established. Fourth, earnestly implement wage and reward policies, ensure strict rewards and punishments, and promote the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of employees. Fifth, care for the lives of employees and solve problems related to employee food, accommodation, and medical care in a timely manner based on the principle of doing what can be done.

In order to effectively improve project quality and complete the construction plan, the conference determined that all basic construction sites should conduct a quality inspection campaign in the second half of the year. The conference also put forward specific measures to improve construction management and political work.

After the meeting, the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee transferred more than 40 cadres to form working groups, which went to four key construction sites at the end of August to help conduct quality inspections.

    中共山西省委员会召开基本建设施工工作会议
    确定在保证工程质量基础上完成国家计划
    【本报讯】中共山西省委员会在八月中旬召开了基本建设施工工作会议，着重检查了上半年基本建设的工程质量，确定下半年全省基本建设的首要任务是在保证提高工程质量的基础上完成国家建设计划。
    会议集中地检查了各地基本建设工程的质量。从全省已完工的百分之三十的工程来看，有些工程的质量是比较好的，但是还有不少主要工程不合乎质量标准，有的甚至发生了严重的质量事故。例如山西省建筑工程公司四工区承建的晋华纺织厂清花间工程、太原市市政建设工程公司施工的汾河公路桥工程、中央第二机械工业部第三工程处负责施工的八三○一工区工厂场房工程等，都发生了质量事故，不仅直接造成人力和物力的巨大损失，而且推迟了工程进度，严重地缩短了建筑物和设备所应有的使用年限。会议认为这是没有树立起好、快、省的统一观念，对工程质量仍重视不够的结果。
    为此，会议认为：第一，要展开群众性的质量检查运动。通过检查发现技术管理上的缺点，并针对这些缺点建立保证工程质量的技术责任制度。为使技术责任制度便于检查执行，还要规定明确的质量标准，建立领导工作制度，实行技术专人负责制和每日每时的检查质量的制度。第二，必须加强工地领导。各单位必须紧缩工区，把干部分配到工地担负实际工作。要决心把技术人员的行政工作减少，充分发挥他们的技术效能做好技术管理工作，提高工人技术水平，保证工程质量。第三，要建立初步的施工作业计划。第四，认真贯彻工资、奖励政策，做到赏罚严明，发扬职工的积极性和责任感。第五，关心职工群众的生活，根据能办即办的原则及时解决职工饮食住宿与医疗卫生问题。
    为了切实改进工程质量，完成建设计划，会议确定下半年各个基本建设工地都要进行一次质量检查运动。会议并在改进施工管理和政治工作方面提出了具体的措施。
    会后，中共山西省委抽调了四十多个干部组成工作组，在八月底分赴四个重点工地，帮助进行质量检查。
