The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU, having heard and discussed the report of Comrade Khrushchev on measures for the further development of Soviet agriculture, resolves:

I. The socialist agriculture of the USSR, developed and consolidated under the leadership of the Communist Party, is based on a powerful industrial-technical foundation. It is the largest and most mechanized agriculture in the world. This agriculture has indisputably proven its decisive advantages over small-scale peasant economy and large-scale capitalist agricultural production.

Collective farms equipped with modern technology are constantly developing, and the collective farm system is becoming increasingly consolidated. Collective farms and state farms have ensured a significant increase in agricultural productivity and the large-scale production of agricultural products for the market. In the post-war years, grain production has not only recovered but also significantly increased, ensuring the supply of grain in our country. The state procurement of cotton, sugar beets, meat, milk, wool, and other agricultural products has increased. In addition to the products delivered to the state, our agriculture also sells large quantities of grain through cooperative and collective farm trading organizations. Due to the comprehensive development of the collective farm economy, the public wealth of the collective farms has increased, and the cash and in-kind income of the collective farmers have also increased.

In the years of peaceful construction and in the difficult years of war, socialist agriculture has demonstrated its great vitality, showing its ability to produce more and more grain for the population and more and more raw materials for light industry and the food industry.

However, the level of agricultural production has not fully satisfied the growing needs of the population for grain and the needs of light industry and the food industry for raw materials. The level of agricultural production is not commensurate with the technical equipment of agriculture and the potential of the collective farm system.

Now, since we have established a powerful and technically advanced heavy industry in our country, and the collective farms have been significantly strengthened, we have all the conditions to ensure the rapid growth of all sectors of agriculture on this basis and, in the next two to three years, significantly increase the supply of grain to the entire population of our country, while ensuring the supply of raw materials for light industry and the food industry.

At the same time, the Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU notes that the enormous potential of large-scale socialist agriculture remains underutilized. In many collective farms and many regions, the yield per unit area of grain and other crops, flax, sugar beets, oilseeds, and other crops remains low. The increase in agricultural productivity, the development of livestock farming, the production of potatoes, vegetables, flax fiber, feed grains, and other feed crops do not meet the requirements of the national economy. The backwardness of these sectors and several other important sectors of agriculture hinders the further development of light industry and the food industry, which are essential for meeting the indispensable needs of the population, and seriously impedes the increase in the income of collective farms and collective farmers.

The development of livestock farming is particularly unsatisfactory. In many collective farms, this important sector has not produced large quantities of products for the market and has not achieved high profits. The care of livestock is poorly organized. In recent years, the increase in the number of livestock has been slow, and the number of cows in the country has not yet reached the pre-war level. The reproduction rate of livestock is low, and significant losses are caused by the death of livestock; a large number of cows do not give birth. Collective farms have not properly developed the feed base for livestock farming, have not produced enough good hay, preserved feed, root crops for livestock, and potatoes. Livestock do not have satisfactory housing, and labor-intensive operations in the livestock sector have not been sufficiently mechanized.

A major shortcoming in the development of agriculture is the serious backwardness in the production of potatoes and vegetables, which prevents the improvement of the supply of these products to cities and industrial centers. The backwardness in potato production is an obstacle to the further development of livestock farming.

The work in state farms has significant shortcomings; state farms have not become exemplary and highly profitable socialist enterprises. In many state farms, the yield of crops and the productivity of livestock products are low; there are cases of poor management, large non-production expenditures, and waste of money and materials, which result in high actual production costs. Many state farms do not have good production buildings, and livestock often live in primitive, unimproved sheds. The mechanization of livestock work and several other production sectors of state farms is seriously lagging behind, and the scale and quality of construction work are insufficient.

What are the reasons for the low level of overall agricultural production and the obvious backwardness of many important sectors of agriculture?

The Communist Party has consistently pursued the policy of developing heavy industry as a necessary condition for the successful development of all sectors of the national economy and has achieved great success in this area. The main attention was focused on completing this primary task of the national economy, and the main resources and financial means were also used for this purpose. Our best cadres were previously engaged in the work of industrializing the state. We did not have the opportunity to develop agriculture and light industry at a very high speed simultaneously with the development of heavy industry. The necessary conditions for this had to be created. Today, we have these conditions. We already have a powerful industrial base, consolidated collective farms, and cadres trained in all aspects of economic construction.

Some of the main sectors of agriculture have other reasons for their backwardness, and the root cause of the shortcomings in our work and the shortcomings in the leadership of agriculture is that we ourselves have created them.

One of the main reasons is the violation of the principle that agricultural workers have a material interest in the development of production and in increasing their own income, which is one of the fundamental principles of socialist management. The facts show that the principle of material interest, which was successfully applied in the production of cotton, sugar beets, tea, citrus fruits, has not been extended to several other important sectors of agriculture.

The principle of obligatory deliveries of agricultural products and livestock by collective farms to the state, established by the Party and the government, based on the interests of the development of all public economic sectors of the collective farms, is completely correct. However, in the actual procurement work, this principle has been distorted, and often those advanced, well-working collective farms with high yields of agricultural products and high livestock productivity generally deliver more products to the state than those backward, poorly working collective farms.

Such an abnormal situation cannot stimulate the increase in the yield of agricultural products and the productivity of livestock products and cannot encourage advanced collective farms. In such a situation, advanced collective farms and diligent collective farmers who have increased agricultural production do not receive encouragement, and they do not have a more favorable position than those collective farms and collective farmers who do not care much about strengthening the public economy, increasing the yield of agricultural products, and the productivity of livestock products.

The backwardness in the development of livestock farming and the production of vegetables and potatoes is to a large extent due to the fact that the state has not given sufficient encouragement to the development of these important sectors of agriculture. The prices for the procurement and purchase of livestock products, potatoes, and vegetables, which have been in effect for a long time, have not been able to stimulate the collective farms and collective farmers in a material sense to develop these important sectors of agriculture.

In many collective farms, the most important principle of the organizational and labor structure of the collective farm economy has been violated. This principle is: to correctly combine the public interests and private interests in the collective farm under the condition that private interests are subordinate to public interests. According to the charter of agricultural labor cooperatives, the primary and decisive factor in the collective farm is the public economy. At the same time, each collective farm household has the right to engage in small-scale personal subsidiary farming to meet the consumption needs that the public economy cannot fully satisfy. Due to the violation of this principle, due to the increase in the procurement standards for products from household plots, and due to some shortcomings in our policy on personal subsidiary farming taxes for collective farmers, the number of cows, pigs, and sheep owned by collective farmers has decreased. This situation not only harms the interests of collective farmers but also distorts the nature of the organizational and labor structure of the collective farm, which is the only correct form of collective economy during the entire socialist period.

One of the main reasons for the serious backwardness in several very important sectors of agriculture is that the powerful technical equipment provided by the socialist state for agriculture has not been fully utilized. In a large number of machine-tractor stations, the working hours of tractors and combine harvesters per shift remain low; the phenomenon of machines standing idle is serious; the most important field work is often delayed, resulting in losses and defects in the entire harvest. The current situation is that, on the one hand, there is a high degree of mechanization in the cultivation of grain, sugar beets, and cotton, while, on the other hand, important sectors of the national economy, such as livestock farming and the production of potatoes, vegetables, flax, and other crops, are lagging behind in mechanization.

To this day, no set of machines has been created that can ensure the complete mechanization of agricultural work under all natural and economic conditions in the country. Even in grain cultivation, which has reached a high degree of mechanization in plowing, sowing, and harvesting, there are still labor-intensive operations on the threshing floor after grain harvesting, the collection and stacking of straw and chaff, the application of organic and mineral fertilizers. In the production of feed, despite the significant mechanization of mowing, the next most important operation of stacking hay has almost not been mechanized. In the design and production of new agricultural machines, in improving the design of machines for mass production and increasing their quality, there is a serious lag.

Some complex technical work in machine-tractor stations, which should be done by technically skilled cadres, is now entrusted to seasonal workers who are temporarily taken from various collective farms during the agricultural season. Most of the leaders of machine-tractor stations do not have sufficient engineering and agricultural knowledge and cannot ensure the skilled leadership of large-scale, mechanized agricultural production.

Some sectors of agriculture are seriously lagging behind mainly because the leadership of the Party, Soviets, and agricultural organizations over collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, primarily in the selection and placement of agricultural cadres and in conducting Party political work in the countryside, is unsatisfactory.

The production of large-scale socialist agriculture, armed with modern machines, can only develop successfully under the condition of constant skilled leadership.

After the merger, collective farms have become multi-sectoral, complex economies. Now we have all the necessary conditions to widely use modern machines, utilize the achievements of Soviet agronomy, and the richest experience of advanced figures and innovators in agriculture.

All this requires skilled leadership for each collective farm, state farm, machine-tractor station, district, for each sector of agriculture and the entire agricultural production. This urgently requires skilled leaders for collective farms, machine-tractor stations, state farms, and districts, agronomists, mechanization engineers, livestock specialists, economists, and other agricultural specialists. Without this most important condition, large-scale socialist agricultural production cannot continue to advance.

At the same time, among the 350,000 specialists working in agricultural organizations, who have higher or secondary education, 18,500 specialists work in various collective farms; 50,000 specialists work in machine-tractor stations. Among the 94,000 chairmen of collective farms, only 2,400 have higher education, and only 14,200 have secondary specialized education. The vast majority of the directors, chief engineers, and chief agronomists of machine-tractor stations have not received higher education. Most agronomists, engineers, livestock specialists, veterinarians, and other specialists are distributed in various organizations, while machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms feel a severe shortage of skilled agricultural cadres.

The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU also notes that some departments, especially the Ministry of Wood and Paper Industry of the USSR, the Ministry of Building Materials Industry of the USSR, the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the USSR, the industrial departments of local industry and cooperatives, have provided extremely insufficient assistance to agriculture in supplying collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms with wood, bricks, lime, and roofing materials, which hinders the construction of livestock housing and other production buildings in collective farms and state farms, as well as construction work in machine-tractor stations.

Finally, it is necessary to point out the causes arising from the collective farms themselves, the chairmen and management boards of collective farms, and the collective farmers. In many collective farms, labor discipline remains lax, and not all collective farmers fully participate in the production of the collective farm. The labor of collective farmers is not well organized everywhere. There are still many cases of irresponsible and neglectful attitudes towards public property.

The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU acknowledges that the situation in several important sectors of agriculture is unsatisfactory and believes that it is necessary to urgently take a number of major measures to raise the backward sectors of agriculture, backward collective farms, state farms, and districts to the level of advanced ones, in order to ensure the powerful rise of the entire socialist economy. Our task is: in the next two to three years, to fully satisfy the growing needs of our country's population for grain and to ensure the supply of raw materials for light industry and the food industry.

II. Further Development of Livestock Farming and Reduction of Obligatory Deliveries of Livestock Products by Collective Farmers, Workers, and Employees

Collective farms and state farms have, in a short period, healed the serious losses inflicted on livestock farming during the war years and significantly increased the number of livestock. From July 1945 to July 1953, the number of cows in the USSR increased by 11.3 million, sheep and goats by 53.9 million, pigs by 25.1 million, and horses by 6.2 million.

The achievements in the development of livestock farming have led to an increase in the state procurement of livestock products: in 1952, the procurement of meat reached 300 million tons, which is 1.5 times the 1940 level; the procurement of milk reached 1,000 million tons, almost 1.6 times the 1940 level; the procurement of wool reached 182,000 tons, which is 1.5 times the 1940 level.

Many state farms and collective farms have already achieved a very high level of productivity of livestock products. In the state farms "Karavaev" in Kostroma Oblast, "Omsk" in Omsk Oblast, "Gorky-II," "Forest Steppe," and "Kholmogory" in Moscow Oblast, in recent years, each cow has produced an average of 5,500 kg of milk per year. In 1952, more than 200 state farms had an average milk yield of 4,000 kg per cow. In the collective farms "October 12" in Kostroma Oblast, "Stalin" in Lukhovitsy District of Moscow Oblast, "Molotov" in Lamin District, "New Life" in Kholmogory District of Arkhangelsk Oblast, and many other collective farms, in 1951 and 1952, the average milk yield per cow was 4,000 to 5,000 kg, and even more.

State farms that have achieved a high yield of 6.5 to 7 kg of fine wool per sheep include "Soviet Wool" and "Bolshevik" in Stavropol Krai, "Rubtsov" in Altai Krai, "Chelevlyubrun" in Grozny Oblast; as well as the collective farms "Soviet State" in Stepanovsky District of Stavropol Oblast, "Second Five-Year Plan" in Ipatovsky District, and several collective farms in Rostov Oblast, Grozny Oblast, and Altai Krai.

In the collective farms "October of the World" and "New Path" in Chernigov District of Chernigov Oblast, as well as in several collective farms in Poltava Oblast and Moscow Oblast, there are 2 to 4 tons of pork per 100 hectares of arable land.

The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU notes at the same time that the current number of public livestock and the level of their productivity are still insufficient. The number of cows in the country is still 3.5 million less than the pre-war level and 8.9 million less than in 1928. In 1952 alone, the total number of cattle and sheep in the country decreased by 2.2 million, including 550,000 cows. At the same time, it should be noted that the number of horses in the country is also decreasing: it is 60% less than before the revolution and 27% less than in 1940. Under normal management, the decrease in the number of horses should have led to a significant increase in the number of livestock producing livestock products. However, this is not the case. The state's plans for increasing livestock have not been fulfilled year after year. Due to poor care for livestock, the productivity of livestock products is extremely low. In recent years, the amount of milking, shearing, and other quality indicators of livestock farming have been declining. Due to the death of livestock, collective farms suffer significant losses every year, and the target for reproduction is not achieved. Many leaders of collective farms, local Soviet organizations, and agricultural organizations do not organize the work of breeding public livestock in livestock farms but continue to purchase large quantities of livestock from collective farmers.

In recent years, collective farms and state farms in the Kazakh Republic, Kirghiz Republic, Kalinin Oblast, Kaluga Oblast, Kostroma Oblast, Novgorod Oblast, Voronezh Oblast, Smolensk Oblast, Kirov Oblast, Novosibirsk Oblast, and Voronezh Oblast have produced particularly large shortcomings in the development of livestock farming.

Livestock farming has not been able to fully develop even in the pre-war years and has not been able to fully meet the needs of the population for meat and dairy products; it has not been able to fully meet the needs of the most important raw materials for light industry. Now, when the national economy has risen to a new, higher stage, and the demand for livestock products has greatly increased, the long-standing backwardness of livestock farming has become a serious obstacle to further increasing the material well-being of the working people and developing light industry and the food industry.

The unfavorable situation in the development of livestock farming is primarily due to the backwardness in the production and storage of feed. In many collective farms, the development of forage farming is insufficient, the yield of natural and sown forage is particularly low, the production of root crops, melon feed, and livestock corn and sunflowers is in a state of neglect. The production of potatoes for livestock is also insufficient. Due to the low yield of feed crops and the insufficient mechanization of mowing, especially stacking, collecting, and storing straw, the plans for storing coarse feed have not been fulfilled year after year. The serious obstacle to increasing labor productivity in livestock farms is the labor-intensive work in livestock farming, primarily the supply of water and the production of feed, which have not been fully mechanized. In various livestock farms, low-productivity manual labor still predominates.

The work of watering livestock in arid steppe regions is also unsatisfactory, which hinders the increase in the number of livestock and their productivity.

Many collective farms have not completed the plans for the construction of livestock housing, so in winter, livestock are crowded together in poorly equipped livestock houses.

One of the important reasons for the backwardness of livestock farming is the insufficient attention to the material interests of collective farms and collective farmers in the development of this very important sector of agriculture. Until now, many collective farms have sold a significant part of their livestock products to the state as obligatory delivery quotas, and the current prices for meat, milk, butter, and eggs for procurement and purchase are not based on the necessary material interests of collective farms and collective farmers in the development of public livestock farming.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, and many local Soviet and agricultural organizations have, for many years, tolerated the shortcomings in the development of livestock farming without taking the necessary measures to increase the production of feed, ensure that all livestock have housing, expand the production of feed and mechanize labor-intensive work in livestock farms, improve the breeding of livestock, and protect young livestock. Scientific achievements and the experience of advanced breeders have not been sufficiently applied in production, and only good collective farms and state farms have adopted them.

The situation with livestock owned by collective farmers is unsatisfactory. Many local Party, Soviet, and agricultural organizations have obviously relaxed their attention to this matter and do not help each collective farm household to have livestock within the limits prescribed by the charter of agricultural labor cooperatives and to provide their livestock with feed and pasture.

The Plenum believes that the most rapid development of livestock farming, primarily the development of livestock farming in collective farms and state farms, is of great importance to the state, and today it is the most urgent task of the Party and the government in the field of agriculture.

The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU decides:

1. To consider the main task of the Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, the Party, Soviets, and agricultural organizations to be the elimination of the intolerable backwardness in the development of livestock farming, the creation of a solid feed base, the construction of housing for livestock and poultry, the rapid increase in the productivity of livestock products, the acceleration of the increase in the number of livestock, the improvement of livestock breeds, and the significant increase in the production of livestock products in the next two to three years.

2. To consider it necessary to increase the number of livestock by 1954 to the following figures:
   - Cows to 29.2 million, total cattle to 65.9 million, sheep and goats to 144.4 million, pigs to 34.5 million.

   To increase the number of dairy cows in collective farms as quickly as possible in order to achieve the goal of having at least 60% of the total livestock in suburban collective farms and at least 50% in other regions of the country be dairy cows, and at least 40% in the collective farms of Kazakhstan, Central Asia, the North Caucasus, the South Caucasus, Astrakhan, Chelyabinsk, Chita, Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republic, and Tuva Autonomous Oblast in the steppe, semi-desert, and mountainous regions. If the goal of increasing the number of dairy cows has been achieved, then the goal of increasing the number of livestock should be considered achieved.

   To develop poultry farming, it is necessary to have at least 100 to 200 laying hens per 100 hectares of grain crops in collective farms by 1954-1955, depending on the specific conditions of the region. In steppe collective farms, the number of turkeys should also be significantly increased, and collective farms with pastures and ponds should raise geese and ducks in addition to chickens.

   The fish farming in the ponds of collective farms should also be significantly developed.

   The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR and the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR should include in their plans the targets for increasing the number of livestock and their productivity in the oblasts, krais, and republics; the Councils of Ministers of the republics and the executive committees of the krais, oblasts, and districts should include in their plans the targets for their districts and collective farms. When determining these targets, it is necessary to consider the economic and natural conditions of the regions that are favorable for the development of certain types of livestock farming and unfavorable for the development of other types of livestock farming.

3. To strictly adhere to the principle of obligatory deliveries of livestock products to the state per hectare, established by the Party and the government. It is not allowed to adopt the harmful practice of increasing the tasks for advanced livestock collective farms. Each district can only implement one obligatory delivery standard per hectare.

4. To abolish the incorrect practice of planning and calculating the fulfillment of livestock farming tasks as of January 1st of each year. According to this practice, collective farms, in order to report the fulfillment of the plan, have to keep and feed a large number of non-production and selected livestock, ready for delivery to the state, sale, or consumption, until January 1st. It is necessary to plan and calculate the fulfillment of livestock farming tasks as of October 1st of each year, because at that time the storage of feed, the repair of livestock houses, and the preparation for winter are almost completed, the livestock are well-fed, and it is possible to ensure the fulfillment of the plan for the delivery of good meat to the state.

5. The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the Party and Soviet organizations to widely explain to collective farmers, workers, and employees the decisions of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU on increasing the reserves and procurement prices of livestock products, the decisions on the state procurement plan and conditions for meat, milk, and eggs in the second half of 1953 (the purpose of these decisions is to increase the material interests of collective farms and collective farmers in the development of public livestock farming), as well as the decisions of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU on reducing the obligatory delivery standards of livestock products by collective farmers, workers, and employees.

   The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, local Party, Soviet, and agricultural organizations to take measures to unconditionally fulfill the 1953 obligatory delivery plan and the state procurement plan for livestock products.

6. To suggest that collective farms, based on the decision of the general meeting of the collective farm, can advance to collective farmers approximately 25% of the funds from the sale of livestock and livestock products. This advance payment should be made to collective farmers every quarter, with 15% being the full reward for all labor days of the previous quarter, and the remaining 10% being the reward for labor days in livestock farming and feed production. At the same time, it is stipulated that the advance payment received by collective farmers as the reward for labor days in livestock farming and feed production should not be reduced during the final distribution of cash income.

   The existing practice of rewarding with bonuses for overfulfilling the plan in the breeding of small livestock, the protection of large livestock, and the increase in their productivity should be continued and the bonuses should be paid on time.

7. The Plenum considers that, while striving for the full development of livestock farming, local Party, Soviet, and agricultural organizations should thoroughly correct the harmful practices that harm the interests of collective farmers in private livestock, because the presence of a certain number of private livestock in each household of the collective farm is an important condition for increasing the material well-being of farmers and increasing the total amount of livestock products in the country, which is beneficial for both collective farmers and the state. To make it easier for collective farmers to obtain private livestock, according to the case files, those collective farmers who did not have private livestock as of July 15, 1953, will not be required to deliver meat in the second half of 1953 and in 1954.

   To cancel the arrears of obligatory deliveries of private livestock products by collective farmers, workers, and employees to the state up to January 1, 1953. It is necessary to explain to collective farmers, workers, and employees that the state takes this measure, on the one hand, to help them preserve their existing private livestock, and on the other hand, to make it easier for those who do not have livestock to obtain livestock.

8. If the Party, Soviet, agricultural organizations, and all agricultural workers do not seriously take up the task of establishing a permanent feed base in each collective farm and state farm, livestock farming cannot move forward. In many districts and collective farms, the neglect of the feed base has reached an absolutely intolerable level.

   The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, local Soviets, agricultural organizations, and the leaders of machine-tractor stations and state farms to eliminate the neglect of the feed base in the shortest possible time and to fully ensure that public livestock have excellent hay, various coarse feed, root crops, preserved feed, green feed, feed grains, and other compressed feed.

   Measures should be taken to expand the cultivation of perennial grasses, annual grasses, corn, sunflowers, root crops, and melon feed, and significantly increase their yield per unit area. For this, it is necessary to take decisive measures to improve the cultivation technology of feed crops. It is necessary to take measures to cultivate feed grains in the central black earth and non-black earth oblasts, Belarus, the Baltic republics, the southern Urals, Siberia, the Far East, and the northern regions of Kazakhstan. Each collective farm and state farm must store at least 5 to 6 tons of feed for each dairy cow. Each collective farm and state farm must build feed storage facilities with a capacity sufficient to fully complete their feed production plans. Since potatoes are high-quality feed, the production of potatoes for livestock must be significantly increased, especially in the non-black earth regions, the Urals, the central black earth oblasts, and western Siberia.

   Collective farms and state farms must widely practice summer outdoor grazing of livestock and establish a zoning system for the use of pastures.

   Measures should be taken to improve veterinary services for livestock. The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR should investigate the use of seasonal pastures and submit proposals for their more effective and rational use to the Council of Ministers of the USSR for review by January 1, 1954.

   It is suggested that collective farms provide livestock herders with the necessary living and housing conditions, work clothes, and shoes.

9. During the periods of mowing and collecting straw, rewards should be given to collective farmers and tractor brigade workers for mowing and storing hay based on the number of labor days, which can reach 10% of the total amount of hay and straw prepared, recorded in the accounts, and acknowledged by the management board of the collective farm; during the second mowing of natural meadows - 20%; in collective farms that have completed the hay storage plan, rewards should be given based on the number of labor days for the amount of hay stored above the plan by 30%. In addition, during the preparation of feed, starting from the beginning of the year, it is possible to give collective farmers a part of the income in advance based on the number of labor days of all collective farmers, which can reach 5% of the total amount of stored hay and 10% of the collected and stacked straw. It is suggested that collective farms provide collective farmers with pastures for grazing livestock and help collective farmers obtain transport for loading the prepared feed.

10. To correct the indifferent attitude of many machine-tractor stations towards the development of livestock farming. In 1954, the level of mechanization of mowing, raking, and stacking hay in collective farms should be increased to 65%, and the level of mechanization of stacking large haystacks should be increased to 50%; in 1955, the level of mechanization of mowing, raking, and stacking hay should be increased to 80%, and the level of mechanization of stacking large haystacks should be increased to 65%; in 1954 and 1955, the level of mechanization of preparing preserved feed should be 65% and 75%, respectively, the level of mechanization of cultivating preserved feed crops and root crops for livestock should be 75% in 1954 and 95% in 1955, the level of mechanization of collecting and stacking straw from fields harvested with combines should be 50% in 1954 and 70% in 1955.

   To expand the production and supply of the following products for agriculture: various types of mowers, rakes, hay collectors, haystackers, hay wagons, green feed harvesting combines, corn harvesters, excavators, ditch diggers, drainage equipment, earth-moving machines, road-building machines, bush-cutting machines, peat root-cutting machines, excavators, water supply mechanization pumps, wooden and metal troughs, cast iron, asbestos-cement, reinforced concrete and gas pipes, automatic waterers, cableways, and various types of electric motors.

   The Ministry of Machine Building should strengthen the design work of new machines and tools necessary for the comprehensive mechanization of feed production, drainage, and fundamental improvement of pastures and meadows, as well as the mechanization of labor-intensive processes in livestock farming.

11. To ensure that collective farms build the following number of livestock houses in 1954: 4.2 million cattle and calf houses, 16.3 million sheep houses, 4.5 million pig houses, 27 million poultry houses, and 30 million chicken houses.

   The State Planning Committee of the USSR should allocate the necessary number of boards, timber, and other building materials to collective farms.

   To increase the production of bricks, tiles, and lime by local industrial enterprises and cooperative industrial enterprises for collective farms. It is suggested that collective farms, under economically advantageous conditions, produce bricks, tiles, and lime with their own forces and resources.

   The State Planning Committee of the USSR, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, and the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR should, within three months, study the improvement of the local timber industry to meet the needs of collective farms and state farms and submit proposals to the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

12. To ensure the significant development of livestock farming in state farms, to increase the productivity of their products, to reduce production costs, and to increase the amount of meat, milk, wool, hides, and other products delivered to the state, it is necessary to ensure the production of sufficient and high-quality hay, sweet feed, and significantly increase the amount of compressed feed produced by state farms themselves. Construction work must be decisively improved, all livestock must have improved housing. In the next two to three years, the production of all sectors of state farms should be fully mechanized. In 1954-1955, the necessary number of residential buildings, schools, and other cultural and service facilities for workers and other employees of state farms should be built. The State Planning Committee of the USSR should allocate the necessary funds, materials, and equipment in the annual plans.

13. The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU requires local Party organizations to pay attention to the fact that it is necessary to decisively strengthen the leadership of the development of livestock farming. Public livestock farming is the most complex sector of agriculture, requiring constant attention and competent leadership. Party organizations must change their indifferent attitude towards livestock farming, especially towards the backward collective farms and state farms. It is necessary to use all forces to quickly master the technology of managing large-scale livestock farming and its economics and to train many skilled cadres for this main sector of agriculture. It is necessary to properly distribute the forces of the Party and the Komsomol to strengthen the ranks of livestock farming workers with thousands of Party members and Komsomol members.

   If all local Party, Soviet, and agricultural organizations, agricultural specialists and organizers, Communist Party members and Komsomol members, all collective farmers and workers of machine-tractor stations and state farms decisively and persistently develop livestock farming and spare no effort and resources to achieve this goal, our country will, in the next two to three years, obtain the necessary amount of meat, milk, butter, eggs, and other livestock products for the population, as well as the main raw materials for light industry and the food industry.

III. Increasing the Production and Delivery of Potatoes and Vegetables by Collective Farms and State Farms

Our country has great potential for the production of potatoes and vegetables. Advanced collective farms and state farms have utilized these potentials to produce large quantities of potatoes, cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers, and other vegetables. The Stalin collective farm in Shuya District of Ivanovo Oblast has an average yield of 30 tons of vegetables and 45 tons of cabbage per hectare. The best brigades of this collective farm can produce 50 tons of cabbage and carrots and 32 tons of cucumbers per hectare. The Stalin collective farm in Chernobyl District of Kiev Oblast has a potato yield of 60.7 tons per hectare. In some sections of the Gorky state farm in Moscow Oblast, the cabbage yield per hectare reaches 80 to 100 tons, and the carrot yield reaches 40 to 60 tons.

However, the utilization of the potential for increasing the production of potatoes and vegetables is still unsatisfactory, and the best experience accumulated for increasing the yield of these crops has not been fully utilized.

Many collective farms and state farms plant potatoes on poor lands and very late. Sometimes, the planting rate per hectare does not reach the standard. The inter-row cultivation of potatoes and vegetables is poorly organized. Late and poor harvesting work has caused significant losses. Due to the indulgence of local Soviets and agricultural organizations, an incorrect attitude towards the storage of seed potatoes has formed in collective farms. Seed potatoes are not stored in September, when the climate is most suitable, but in October and November, when it is humid, rainy, and early frosts begin. As a result, the stored potatoes are damp or slightly frozen and not sorted, and a large part of them spoil during storage.

The development of greenhouses and greenhouses is poor, resulting in a small amount of vegetables produced in winter and spring, and insufficient cultivation of cabbage, tomato, and other vegetable seedlings.

The serious backwardness of collective farms and state farms in the production of potatoes and vegetables is primarily due to the fact that, for several years, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR and the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR have not raised and solved such basic issues in the production of potatoes and vegetables as the mechanization of planting, inter-row cultivation, and harvesting of these crops, the improvement of planting methods, and the provision of greater economic incentives to collective farms and state farms to produce these crops.

Machine-tractor stations are rarely involved in the production of potatoes and vegetables. In the cultivation of grain, 90 to 95% of the main work is completed by machine-tractor stations. Last year, machine-tractor stations only did 40% of the potato planting work for collective farms and less than 6% of the potato harvesting work, and almost no work was done in vegetable cultivation. Until recently, the production of potatoes and vegetables was based on manual labor and did not receive sufficient economic incentives, which could not but and actually led to serious backwardness.

The application of scientific achievements and advanced experience is one of the main conditions for the successful development of potato and vegetable production. The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR and the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, as well as their local organizations, have a conservative attitude towards new advanced methods of planting potatoes and vegetables, primarily towards the square-nest method of planting these crops and the cultivation of seedlings in peat-humus containers. These methods, which have been researched for many years and are highly efficient, have not been introduced to collective farms and state farms for large-scale adoption for a long time. In 1953, only 318,000 hectares of land were planted with potatoes using the square-nest method, which is less than 10% of the total potato planting area. The method of cultivating seedlings in peat-humus containers is only adopted by some advanced collective farms and state farms.

The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU considers that the main task in the production of potatoes and vegetables is to significantly increase the yield of these crops through extensive mechanization and the application of advanced agricultural methods. The task is: in the next two to three years, to ensure that the production of potatoes and vegetables not only fully meets the needs of urban residents, industrial centers, and processing industries but also meets the needs of livestock farming for potatoes.

The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU decides:

1. To further increase the production of potatoes and vegetables, the following areas should be increased in 1954:
   - In collective farms: potatoes, 4,128,500 hectares; vegetables, 1,003,400 hectares. It is ensured that 153,100 hectares of irrigated land in collective farms are used for potato cultivation and 284,200 hectares for vegetable cultivation;
   - In state farms under the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR: potatoes, 218,000 hectares; vegetables, 72,500 hectares; in state farms under the Ministry of Food Industry of the USSR: potatoes, 44,000 hectares; vegetables, 20,000 hectares.

2. To set the yield per hectare of potatoes and vegetables in 1954 not less than:
   - In collective farms: potatoes, 14 tons; cabbage, 17.5 tons; cucumbers, 11 tons; tomatoes, 13.5 tons; onions, 8.5 tons; carrots, 12 tons; sugar beets, 13 tons;
   - In state farms: potatoes, 14 tons; cabbage, 21 tons; cucumbers, 11.5 tons; tomatoes, 16.5 tons; onions, 10 tons; carrots, 13.5 tons; sugar beets, 15.5 tons.

3. The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, local Soviets and agricultural organizations, collective farms, state farms, and machine-tractor stations should significantly increase the production of potatoes, especially in the very favorable conditions of the central regions of the European part of the USSR. The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, local Soviets, and agricultural organizations must implement a series of measures to increase the potato yield in the central regions of the European part of the USSR and primarily ensure:
   - The widespread adoption of the square-nest method of potato planting, the extreme mechanization of the inter-row cultivation and harvesting of this crop;
   - The distribution of potatoes on the best lands, including flood-prone lands;
   - The expansion of potato cultivation on irrigated lands;
   - The significant increase in the use of fertilizers, especially manure.

4. The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, the Soviets and agricultural organizations of the republics, krais, and oblasts are tasked with ensuring that in 1954 and 1955, the mechanization of the main work of inter-row cultivation and harvesting of potatoes and vegetables in collective farms and state farms reaches the following levels (as a percentage of the total work volume): in 1954, the mechanization of potato planting, inter-row cultivation, and harvesting in collective farms should be 40 to 65%; in state farms, 80 to 90%. In 1955, the level of mechanization of potato planting, inter-row cultivation, and harvesting should be increased to 80 to 90% in collective farms and to 90% in state farms.

5. To increase the level of mechanization of vegetable planting in collective farms in 1954 to 50%, seedling planting to 35%, inter-row cultivation of vegetables to 70%. The level of mechanization of these works in state farms should be increased to 80 to 85%. In 1955, the level of mechanization of vegetable planting in collective farms should be increased to 80 to 90%, seedling planting to 70 to 80%, inter-row cultivation of vegetables to 80 to 90%. It is ensured that in 1955, the level of mechanization of all vegetable planting work in state farms is increased to 95%.

6. The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, local Soviets and agricultural organizations, the directors of machine-tractor stations and state farms should ensure the widespread adoption of the square-nest method of planting potatoes and vegetables, which makes it possible to mechanize the inter-row cultivation of these crops in two directions. It is ensured that in 1954, the planting of potatoes, tomatoes, and cabbage in collective farms and state farms is generally carried out using the square-nest method. Since there are still not enough potato planting machines for the entire region to implement mechanical planting in 1954, the square-nest method of potato planting should still be widely used with plows, inter-row cultivators, and other agricultural implements.

7. To widely use the method of cultivating seedlings in peat-humus containers, as this method can significantly increase the yield and ensure the early ripening of vegetables. The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, local Soviets and agricultural organizations should ensure that, starting from 1954, peat-humus containers are produced and seedlings are cultivated in containers in all collective farms and state farms. Local Soviet organizations should allocate the task of producing peat-humus containers to collective farms and supervise the completion of these tasks.

8. To ensure the widespread and comprehensive mechanization of the planting and harvesting of potatoes and vegetables, the following machines and tools should be provided for agricultural production: four-row square-nest potato planters; four-row inter-row cultivators with fertilizer attachments; inter-row cultivators and fertilizer applicators towed by KhTZ-7 tractors; potato digging combines; leaf-cutting devices; seedbed planters towed by KhTZ-7 tractors; square-seedling planters; machines for producing peat-humus containers with mechanized feeding and mixing devices; sprinklers and sprayers towed by KhTZ-7 tractors; artificial rain sprinklers; universal loaders suspended from tractors; various fertilizer applicators for manure, peat, mineral fertilizers, and lime; automatic sprayers for spraying liquid organic fertilizers and solutions of mineral fertilizers, large-capacity trucks for transporting vegetables, potatoes, organic fertilizers, and mineral fertilizers, and many other machines.

9. The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the Party and Soviet organizations to widely explain to collective farmers, workers, and employees the decisions of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU on the "State plan for the procurement and purchase of potatoes and vegetables in 1953 and the increase in the procurement prices of these products" and the "Development of trade in potatoes and vegetables by collective farms," which aim to increase the material interests of collective farms and collective farmers by all means to expand the production of potatoes and vegetables.

10. To increase the material interests of collective farms in vegetable production, to reduce the obligatory delivery standards of these crops to the state, and to increase the purchase prices, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, the Councils of Ministers of the union republics, the executive committees of the krais and oblasts are instructed to draft new standards for the obligatory delivery of potatoes by collective farm households and collective farmers to the state, applicable within the district, and new standards for the obligatory delivery of vegetables by collective farms, and submit them for approval by the Council of Ministers of the USSR within one month.

   When drafting new standards, the standards for regions with similar conditions for planting potatoes and vegetables should not be significantly changed in the future. The obligatory delivery standards for regions near cities and industrial centers should only be slightly higher than for other regions.

11. To quickly increase the production of vegetables in regions near cities and industrial centers, the Councils of Ministers of the republics, the executive committees of the krais and oblasts are instructed to follow the example of Moscow Oblast and develop specific measures to concentrate vegetable planting in flood-prone areas, lowlands, and drained peatlands, to mechanize vegetable planting work, and to increase vegetable production on this basis.

12. Given the extreme importance of increasing the production of potatoes and vegetables in state farms, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR is instructed to designate an additional 154 state farms in 1953-1954, and the Ministry of Food Industry of the USSR is instructed to designate an additional 7 state farms to produce vegetables and potatoes.

13. The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, the Councils of Ministers of the republics, the executive committees of the krais and oblasts are instructed to ensure the completion of the tasks for the construction of greenhouses and greenhouses in collective farms and state farms as stipulated in the national economic plan for 1953.

   In 1954, collective farms and state farms will begin using 9,197,000 greenhouse frames and greenhouses with an area of 514,500 square meters. In 1955, they will begin using 11,896,000 greenhouse frames and greenhouses with an area of 745,400 square meters. In 1954, collective farms and state farms will build 2,789,000 greenhouse frames and greenhouses with an area of 252,000 square meters. In 1955, they will build 2,858,000 greenhouse frames and greenhouses with an area of 362,000 square meters.

   It is stipulated that collective farms and state farms will widely use greenhouses and greenhouses heated by steam, water, and electricity, and will use the surplus heat from industrial enterprises on a large scale to heat greenhouses, greenhouses, and soil.

   It is necessary to follow the example of the collective farms of Moscow industrial enterprises, to take care of and help collective farms build greenhouses and greenhouses with the resources of the collective farms. The State Planning Committee of the USSR is instructed to include in the national economic plan the production of materials and components necessary for the construction of greenhouses and greenhouses for collective farms and state farms, to sell these to them, and to supply them with fuel.

14. After pointing out the serious shortcomings in the supply of seed potatoes and criticizing the harmful measures to reduce the planting standards, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, local Soviets and agricultural organizations, and the administrative personnel of collective farms and state farms are instructed to take the necessary measures to ensure that, starting from the 1953 harvest, collective farms and state farms will fully meet their own needs for high-quality seed potatoes and will not allow the planting standards to be reduced. It is stipulated that at the beginning of the large-scale harvest, each collective farm and state farm must store the seed potatoes.

15. In 1953, the successful harvesting, procurement, and purchase of potatoes and vegetables are very important for the work of supplying these crops to the population. The Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurements of the USSR, the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the USSR, the Councils of Ministers of the republics, the executive committees of the krais and oblasts are instructed to ensure the successful completion of the procurement and purchase plans for potatoes and vegetables. They should make every effort to help collective farms organize harvesting work, especially the mechanization of harvesting work, and to help them transport potatoes and vegetables from the fields and collective farm warehouses to the procurement points, piers, and railway stations.

   The Ministry of Transport of the USSR, the Ministry of Maritime and River Transport of the USSR, and the Ministry of Automobile Transport of the USSR should provide transport to those collective farms that have completed the obligatory delivery plan for potatoes and vegetables and the plan for in-kind payments, to transport the products they sell in the collective farm market.

16. To more fully and correctly utilize the mineral fertilizers allocated for the cultivation of potatoes and vegetables, it is stipulated that in 1953 and 1954, these crops will be lent mineral fertilizers to collective farms, which will be repaid with the potatoes or a type of vegetable harvested in the current year. The Ministry of Rural Automobile Transport of the USSR and machine-tractor stations are instructed to transport mineral fertilizers from state warehouses, and machine-tractor stations and collective farms are instructed to apply these fertilizers to the fields.

17. It is necessary to strengthen the vegetable planting brigades of collective farms and state farms, to organize collective farmers, machine-tractor station workers, and state farm workers to learn the best methods of planting vegetables and potatoes, and to train personnel to operate potato planters, seedling planters, and other machines in each collective farm and state farm.

   Through training courses, radio, film, publications, and special lectures and seminars, all collective farmers and workers of machine-tractor stations and state farms should be familiarized with modern equipment and methods of planting potatoes and vegetables. Mastering this technology is a decisive condition for the successful mechanization of the planting, inter-row cultivation, and harvesting of vegetables and potatoes.

18. The Central Committees of the Communist Party of the union republics, the Central Committees of the Communist Party of the krais and oblasts, the district Party committees, and the primary Party organizations in collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms are instructed to decisively improve the leadership of the development of vegetable and potato production. The planting of vegetables is one of the complex sectors of agriculture. To correctly lead this sector, it is necessary to understand it. A Party leader who does not know the mechanization and scientific methods of cultivating potatoes and vegetables, and does not know the essence of square-nest planting, sowing, and other agricultural technical measures, cannot lead the work of further developing the planting of vegetables and potatoes. The Plenum requires Party leaders to ensure the rapid development of vegetable and potato production.

IV. On Increasing the Yield per Unit Area of Grain, Industrial Crops, and Oilseeds

The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU, having heard and discussed the report of Comrade Khrushchev on measures for the further development of Soviet agriculture, resolves:

Title: Significant Achievements and Tasks in the Development of Grain Production

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th

	Significant achievements have been made in the development of grain production. Compared to 1940, the area under cultivation for the most valuable grain crop, wheat, has increased by 81 million hectares. Important grain-producing regions such as Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and Crimea, which suffered severe damage during the war, have quickly restored their agriculture and significantly increased the production of grains, especially winter wheat. Many collective farms and state farms are harvesting 150 to 200 poods or more of wheat per hectare.

	The cultivation areas for sugar beets, sunflowers, and many other industrial crops have been restored and expanded. The expansion of sugar beet cultivation and the increase in yield per unit area have ensured a more adequate supply of sugar to consumers. Significant achievements have been made in cotton production, particularly in the Uzbek, Tajik, and Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republics. Therefore, our country's industry now produces much more cotton textiles than before the war.

	At the same time, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union noted that, although significant achievements have been made in the production of grain, industrial crops, and oilseeds, there are still some major shortcomings. In many collective farms and state farms, especially in the non-black soil regions, the Central Black Earth region, the Volga region, and Siberia, the yield per unit area of grain, oilseeds, legumes, and long-staple flax remains low. In recent years, the area under cultivation for corn and its yield per unit area have decreased in the collective farms of Ukraine.

	The main reasons for the low yield per unit area of crops are the unsatisfactory quality of work by machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms, as well as the neglect of scientific farming by many Soviet officials, machine-tractor station directors, state farm directors, and collective farm chairmen.

	Many machine-tractor stations have not been able to quickly complete field work, the quality of their work is low, and they have not fulfilled the autumn plowing plan. Therefore, a significant portion of spring crops is sown in fields plowed in the spring. The delay in spring sowing has reached an unacceptable level. Fallow land is plowed late, and intertillage work is done poorly. Winter crops are sown late. The bad habit of sowing seeds of different grades and inferior seeds, and sowing less than the standard amount per hectare, has not been completely eliminated.

	Advanced scientific farming methods such as narrow-row sowing of grain and interplanting, as well as square-nest sowing of corn, sunflowers, and other crops, have been proven effective in practice but have not been widely adopted. The best and most productive varieties have not been actively promoted. The production of high-quality seeds of buckwheat, millet, long-staple flax, perennial grasses, and annual grasses has been neglected.

	Many local party organizations have not conducted adequate work among the masses to promote advanced scientific farming methods. They have not properly organized collective farmers, machine-tractor stations, and state farms to complete all tillage and harvesting work at the most appropriate times with high-quality work.

	One of the main reasons for the low yield per unit area of grain, oilseeds, and industrial crops in many regions is the inadequate use of organic and mineral fertilizers, especially manure, peat, and peat-based fertilizers. Due to the lack of storage facilities for manure, the manure in collective farms is poorly stored, reducing its effectiveness. In the Belarusian Republic, Bryansk Oblast, Smolensk Oblast, Veliky Luki Oblast, and other regions, there has been insufficient sowing of crops such as vetch and sainfoin for green manure. In most collective farms in acidic soil and white-gray soil regions, lime has not been used to neutralize the soil.

	Due to the untimely and poor care of grain, oilseeds, and industrial crops, as well as losses during harvesting, many collective farms and state farms have lost a significant amount of agricultural products.

	The work of machine-tractor stations in terms of adherence to deadlines and work quality has not been supervised. State inspectors responsible for supervising the work quality of machine-tractor stations—chief agronomists of district agricultural administrations, chief agronomists and senior agronomists of republic agricultural departments, and chief agronomists of krai and oblast agricultural administrations—have not overseen the work of machine-tractor stations and have not performed their supervisory duties. There is still a practice of setting planned yields per unit area, according to which advanced collective farms and their field brigades are assigned to achieve especially high yield targets per unit area, making it impossible for collective farmers and machine-tractor station drivers to earn additional income for outstanding work, which is incorrect.

	To further increase the total and commercial production of grain, industrial crops, and oilseeds, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided:

	1. Since grain production is the foundation of all agricultural production, it is necessary to fully develop grain production, especially the most valuable grain crops winter wheat and spring wheat, by further increasing the yield per unit area in the main wheat-producing regions, as well as in the Central Black Earth region and the right bank of the Volga region. It is necessary to increase the production of hard wheat in the southeastern regions, Kazakhstan, and western Siberia.

	2. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, local Soviets, and agricultural organizations are instructed to take measures to eliminate the backwardness in grain production, especially buckwheat and millet. To increase the interest of collective farms and collective farmers in growing buckwheat and millet, it is permitted for collective farms:

	(a) To exchange buckwheat for other grains to be delivered to the state and as payment in kind for machine and tractor services, at the rate of 100 kilograms of buckwheat for 200 kilograms of naked wheat or 250 kilograms of wheat. It is suggested that collective farms reward collective farmers and machine-tractor station workers with grain bonuses equal to 50% of the amount by which the collective farm exceeds its buckwheat production target, regardless of the collective farm's total grain harvest and the completion of grain deliveries to the government.

	(b) To exchange millet for other grains to be delivered to the state and as payment in kind for machine-tractor station services, at the rate of 100 kilograms of millet for 105 kilograms of wheat or 125 kilograms of naked wheat. It is suggested that collective farms reward collective farmers and machine-tractor station workers with grain bonuses equal to 50% of the amount by which the collective farm exceeds its millet production target, regardless of the collective farm's total grain harvest and the completion of grain deliveries to the government.

	The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement is tasked with widely conducting trials of small millet (a variety of millet) in research institutes and experimental stations to determine the varieties with the highest yield suitable for different regions and to develop a method of cultivating small millet to promote this high-yielding grain in collective farms and state farms.

	3. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, as well as the local party organizations, Soviets, and agricultural organizations of the southern, Transcaucasian, Central Asian, and Far Eastern regions and republics, are instructed to take measures to significantly increase rice production, expand the area under rice cultivation, ensure timely preparation of irrigation networks, improve cultivation methods, and conduct harvesting at the most appropriate times.

	Special attention should be paid to the production of legumes (peas, soybeans, etc.), which is of great importance for improving the supply of food to the people.

	4. Increase the production of grain feed crops: corn, barley, and oats, which is of great importance for solving the problem of livestock breeding. In the next two to three years, the production of these crops must be developed to provide sufficient grain feed for the livestock of collective farms and state farms.

	In the southern, southeastern, and central regions of the black soil and non-black soil zones, the area under corn cultivation must be expanded. To increase the yield per unit area of corn, it is necessary to widely use square-nest sowing, which will save a lot of labor and ensure the mechanization of intertillage work, thereby increasing the yield per unit area. At the same time, it is necessary to decisively transition to the cultivation of hybrid corn.

	5. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that to increase cotton production, collective farms and state farms must significantly increase the yield per unit area, cultivate virgin lands, and cultivate new irrigated lands to expand the area under this crop, as well as improve soil conditions. It is necessary to accelerate the breeding of high-yielding, early-maturing, medium-staple, and long-staple cotton varieties suitable for mechanized cultivation and adapted to specific soil and climatic conditions.

	The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement and local Soviets and agricultural organizations are instructed to take measures to better utilize existing cotton pickers and to instruct the Ministry of Machine Building to take measures to design more advanced new cotton pickers and cotton-stalk harvesters by 1954-1955.

	6. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Ministry of State Farms, local Soviets, and agricultural organizations are instructed to improve the cultivation methods of sugar beets, mechanize the harvesting work, use fertilizers, and take necessary measures to combat diseases and pests affecting the sugar beet harvest, to further increase the production of this crop.

	To further mechanize the harvesting and loading of sugar beets, the Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement should significantly increase the production of sugar beet combines and design several loading machines by 1953-1954 to begin production in 1954 and use them in all collective farms and state farms growing sugar beets.

	7. The task of the party, Soviet, and agricultural organizations in the flax and hemp growing regions is to expand the area under flax and hemp cultivation and significantly increase the yield and commercial production of these crops. It is necessary to improve the cultivation methods of flax and hemp: sowing them after the most suitable preceding crops, fundamentally improving seed breeding, timely and effective harvesting, and primary processing of flax and hemp to minimize losses, and further mechanize the main operations of intertillage and harvesting of these crops.

	It is necessary to build mechanized flax and hemp processing workshops and flax scutching workshops in flax and hemp factories to ensure that by 1955, 85 to 90% of the commercial production of flax stalks and branches is fully processed by flax factories.

	8. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Ministry of State Farms, the Councils of Ministers of the republics, local Soviets, and agricultural organizations are instructed to take measures to further increase the production of sunflowers and expand the area under sunflower cultivation in Kazakhstan, Siberia, and the Urals, ensure the scientific cultivation of oil crops, including the widespread use of square-nest sowing in sunflower and castor bean cultivation, and mechanize the intertillage and harvesting of these crops. Ensure the breeding and promotion of new, early-maturing, high-oil-content, and disease-resistant varieties of oil crops.

	9. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Ministry of State Farms, local Soviets, and agricultural organizations are instructed:

	(a) To take necessary measures to expand the area under fruit and berry cultivation, ensure the completion of the plan for establishing new orchards, vineyards, and berry gardens in 1953, and significantly increase the area under fruit and berry cultivation in 1954 and 1955.

	Improve existing orchards, vineyards, and berry gardens, and under no circumstances allow them to become overgrown due to poor care, ensuring a bountiful harvest of berries, grapes, and other fruits in 1954;

	(b) Increase the area under watermelon and melon cultivation, as it is necessary to significantly increase the supply of watermelons and melons to industrial centers across the country in 1954 compared to 1953.

	10. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Ministry of State Farms, local Soviets, and agricultural organizations are instructed:

	(a) To eliminate the neglect of breeding high-quality seeds of perennial and annual forage grasses, ensure that each collective farm and state farm has self-sufficiency in seeds of perennial and annual forage grasses, and also breed these crops for the market, mainly in regions where the yield of forage grass seeds has been consistently high for many years;

	(b) Ensure the completion of autumn plowing of all fields to be sown in the spring of 1954 in collective farms and state farms, and ensure the completion of the autumn plowing plan. Ensure the plowing of fallow land in April and May 1954 to be sown with winter crops in 1955, especially fallow land to be sown with winter crops in 1956; in June and July 1954, plow fallow land in Siberia and the southern Urals to be sown with spring wheat in 1955.

	In regions with sufficient moisture, especially in the black soil and non-black soil zones, as well as in the forest-steppe regions of Ukraine, it is possible to obtain good harvests by sowing winter crops on semi-fallow land, gradually converting all fallow land in these regions into semi-fallow land in the coming years and sowing early-maturing crops on it.

	11. Ensure the accumulation and use of local fertilizers (manure, peat, liquid manure, and various decayed plant fertilizers). In regions with peat deposits, increase peat production for use as fertilizer and bedding. On a large scale, organize the preparation and use of decayed plant fertilizers and organic-mineral mixed fertilizers to increase the use of organic fertilizers in collective farms by 50 to 100% compared to 1952 within two to three years.

	The Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Ministry of Metallurgy are instructed to increase the production capacity of mineral fertilizers (in standard units) from 1954 to 1963, reaching 16.5 to 17.5 million tons in 1959 and 28 to 30 million tons in 1964. In 1955, the production of granular superphosphate should increase to 45% of the total superphosphate production, and in 1958, to 60%. Ensure that from 1956 onwards, only granular nitrates are supplied to agriculture. Develop plans for the widespread use of apatite and local phosphate rocks in agriculture.

	The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Ministry of State Farms, local Soviets, and agricultural organizations are instructed to take measures to eliminate storage losses, improve storage facilities, and improve the use of mineral fertilizers.

	12. Neutralizing acidic soils and using gypsum in saline soil regions is an important method for increasing the yield per unit area. In this regard, the Councils of Ministers of the union republics are instructed to ensure a significant increase in lime production from 1954 onwards in building materials industries, local industries, and production cooperatives to meet the needs of agriculture, and to strive to reduce the price of lime.

	13. In the next two to three years, increase the production of chemical pesticides, especially DDT, hexachlorane, and chloropicrin, to twice the planned amount for 1953, and in the following years, organize the production of organic phosphorus compounds to fully meet the demand for chemical pesticides in agriculture. In the next two years, produce and supply more high-efficiency pest control machines and devices to collective farms, state farms, and the personal plots of collective farmers and workers for pest control.

	14. Further improve the work of machine-tractor stations to enable them to play a greater role in the development of collective farm production.

	Machine-tractor stations are the industrial, material, and technical foundation of the collective farm system, and today they are the decisive force in the development of collective farm production and the most important organ through which the socialist state exercises leadership over collective farms. In recent years, significant achievements have been made in the mechanization of agriculture. Machine-tractor stations have received a lot of modern equipment, making it possible to mechanize many labor-intensive operations, reduce the labor of collective farmers, and significantly increase labor productivity.

	These highly technical machine-tractor stations play an organizational role; they are large state enterprises, and about three-quarters of the tillage work in collective farms is done by them. Therefore, to significantly improve the production work of collective farms in all areas, it is necessary to rely primarily on machine-tractor stations.

	At the same time, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union noted that there are serious shortcomings in the work of machine-tractor stations. Many machine-tractor stations do not have skilled tractor drivers, skilled tractor brigade leaders, skilled machine operators, and other workers. The machine operators of machine-tractor stations are overworked. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that in the current situation, where machine-tractor stations have become large state enterprises with complex machinery, it is incorrect that they do not have permanent machine operators.

	Currently, the system of training personnel in machine-tractor stations has serious shortcomings. There are not enough mechanical schools to meet the demand for machine operators, so machine-tractor stations have to train tractor drivers, combine drivers, and other tractor brigade workers in short-term courses, which generally reduces the quality of training.

	Many party organizations, Soviets, and agricultural organizations in districts, krai, and republics have not paid due attention to the work of selecting, assigning, and training administrative personnel for machine-tractor stations. They have not taken the opportunity to attract technical personnel from industrial and scientific institutions to work in machine-tractor stations.

	Therefore, many directors of machine-tractor stations, chief engineers of repair shops, and managers are people who have only practical experience but no specialized education. Machine-tractor stations and specialized technical stations lack experts with higher agricultural and animal husbandry education to work in collective farms.

	Most machine-tractor stations have poorly organized repair and storage of tractors and agricultural machinery. Many machine-tractor stations do not have repair shops, necessary equipment, tractor storage sheds, or open sheds for storing agricultural machinery, as well as other production buildings and buildings for workers.

	The material and technical supply work of machine-tractor stations is also poorly organized. Industrial departments have not supplied machine-tractor stations with sufficient quantities of spare parts, tools, oil tanks, metal, and other materials in a timely manner, which has seriously hindered the work of machine-tractor station brigades.

	To further improve the work of machine-tractor stations and enable them to play a greater role in the mechanization of all production work in collective farms, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided:

	1. The main task of machine-tractor stations is to increase the yield per unit area of all crops in collective farms by all possible means, ensure an increase in the number of public livestock, and simultaneously increase the productivity of livestock products, increase the total and commercial production of agricultural products and livestock in the collective farms they serve. Machine-tractor stations must complete the mechanization of field work for crops, further mechanize labor-intensive operations in livestock breeding and potato and other vegetable production, apply scientific achievements and the most advanced methods to collective farm production, and ensure the further consolidation of collective farms in organizational and economic terms, thereby improving the material well-being of collective farmers.

	2. The most important task of party organizations, Soviets, and agricultural organizations is to provide machine-tractor stations with permanent machine operators who can fully and effectively utilize the equipment, thereby ensuring a further and powerful increase in the production of all sectors of collective farms.

	To accomplish this task, it is decided: in machine-tractor stations and specialized technical stations, tractor drivers, tractor brigade leaders and their assistants, excavator operators and their assistants, fuel recorders, and those who care for tractors and agricultural machinery pulled by tractors, as well as combine assistants, should become permanent workers and be included in the staff of machine-tractor stations. Those who care for tractors and agricultural machinery pulled by tractors, as well as combine assistants, should be included in the staff of machine-tractor stations as seasonal workers.

	The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, local party organizations, Soviets, and agricultural organizations should, in the near future, ensure that all machine-tractor stations are staffed with permanent workers and organize the year-round employment of tractor drivers and other permanent workers of tractor brigades. For this purpose, it is necessary to encourage tractor drivers, combine drivers, machine operators, and other permanent workers to master several trades. During the agricultural off-season, permanent members of tractor brigades should be employed in repair shops and mechanization teams in livestock breeding, as well as in construction and other work.

	3. In addition to establishing a fixed wage system and encouraging workers of tractor brigades, it is also necessary:

	(a) To establish the following cash wages for workers of tractor brigades in machine-tractor stations, depending on the region: tractor drivers, tractor brigade leaders, and their assistants, 5 to 8 rubles per labor day; fuel recorders, 3 to 4 rubles per labor day; combine assistants, 4 to 6 rubles per labor day; operators of machinery pulled by tractors, 2 rubles 50 kopecks per labor day;

	(b) To establish the current guaranteed minimum grain wages in kind for tractor brigade workers in machine-tractor stations and specialized technical stations based on actual harvests as payment per labor day, while collective farms should transfer the grain that should be given to tractor brigade workers according to the current guaranteed minimum to procurement organizations;

	(c) Machine-tractor stations and specialized technical stations should pay wages to permanent workers of tractor brigades for work in repair shops and mechanization of livestock breeding according to wage rates and piecework rates established by the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement;

	(d) For tractor drivers and other permanent workers of tractor brigades in machine-tractor stations and specialized technical stations who do not have personal plots, provide personal plots.

	4. To improve the training of skilled machine operators, it is necessary to adopt the system of training machine operators in industrial vocational schools. Therefore, existing mechanical schools will be reorganized into agricultural machinery schools to train the following specialists:

	(a) Tractor drivers and machine operators who have studied the operation of diesel tractors, combines, and complex agricultural machinery for one year and have mastered mechanics;

	(b) Tractor drivers who have studied the operation of tracked and wheeled tractors and agricultural machinery for half a year and have mastered mechanics;

	(c) Combine drivers and mechanics who have studied the operation of self-propelled combines and tractor-pulled combines and the installation and assembly of machinery for mechanizing livestock breeding for half a year.

	According to the standards for students of vocational schools, agricultural machinery schools should be provided with clothing, shoes, and shirts.

	5. On the basis of vocational schools of the Ministry of Culture of the USSR and factory training schools, organize 250 vocational schools and agricultural mechanization training schools, and open at least 300 new agricultural mechanization schools by 1954-1957, each with 240 to 270 students, and build 200 school buildings, 315 practice buildings, and 600 dormitories for existing agricultural mechanization schools.

	The Ministry of Culture of the USSR, in conjunction with the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement and the Ministry of State Farms, should submit proposals to the Council of Ministers of the USSR on the organization of these agricultural mechanization vocational schools and training schools.

	6. To supply machine-tractor stations and state farms with more tractors, agricultural machinery, and equipment, the national economic plan should provide for the supply of at least 500,000 general-purpose tractors (each with 15 horsepower) to agriculture from 1954 to May 1, 1957, 250,000 tillage tractors, and the necessary number of agricultural machinery, automobiles, mobile repair shops, oil product containers, and other equipment.

	7. It should be noted that in machine-tractor stations, the level of complex agricultural machinery equipment and their repair and maintenance production and technical base are extremely disproportionate. Many machine-tractor stations do not have repair shops, storage sheds, open sheds, and other production buildings and facilities for workers.

	Given the importance of strengthening the production and technical base of machine-tractor stations, it is decided: each machine-tractor station and specialized technical station must have a standard repair shop that meets the requirements, at least two to three tractor storage sheds, two to three combine open sheds, the necessary number of sheds for storing agricultural machinery and open concrete platforms, a fuel station, a car shed, a spare parts warehouse, an office, a water supply station, and at least a minimal drainage system.

	The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement and its local organizations, krai and oblast executive committees, and Councils of Ministers of the republics are instructed:

	(a) To ensure the completion and use of 673 repair shops, 1,130 open sheds and sheds, and 81,200 square meters of buildings as planned by the national economy in 1953, and to begin the construction of 500 new repair shops;

	(b) To ensure the completion and use of 4,200 repair shops, 8,400 tractor storage sheds, 8,400 combine open sheds, 15,000 sheds and 15,000 open concrete platforms for storing agricultural machinery, 2,880 fuel stations, 3,600 car sheds, and 3,600 spare parts warehouses during the period from 1954 to 1956;

	(c) To build 9 repair factories and 6 inter-district major repair shops during 1954-1956, and to complete the construction and start the operation of 36 repair factories and 15 inter-district major repair shops during 1954-1955;

	(d) To expand and reconstruct 41 repair factories and 125 inter-district major repair shops during 1954-1955. The funds for all repair enterprises of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement should be provided from the state budget of the USSR.

	The Ministry of Forestry and Paper Industry, the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, and the Ministry of Metallurgy should prioritize the shipment of construction materials allocated to machine-tractor stations.

	8. To create the necessary living conditions for workers, engineers, technical personnel, and other employees of machine-tractor stations, it is necessary:

	(a) To complete and use 1,080 residential buildings and 3,000 dormitories during 1954-1956;

	(b) To ensure the large-scale development of private housing construction for workers, engineers, technical personnel, and other employees of machine-tractor stations, and to allocate 450 million rubles annually for private housing construction loans during 1954-1956, providing loans of up to 12,000 rubles with a 10-year repayment period, starting repayment after 3 years;

	(c) To provide machine-tractor stations with a certain number of prefabricated two-room and one-room houses and building materials in the national economic plan to help machine-tractor station workers build private houses;

	(d) To suggest that collective farms build public dormitories, sheds for storing and repairing machinery, field kitchens, and fixed fuel depots in the fields during 1954-1955.

	9. The production of spare parts for tractors and agricultural machinery is seriously lagging behind, which is unacceptable because this situation prevents tractors and agricultural machinery from being repaired in a timely and high-quality manner. The Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Transport and Heavy Machine Building have not paid due attention to the production of spare parts and the uninterrupted and complete supply of spare parts to agriculture.

	The Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Transport and Heavy Machine Building should significantly increase the production of spare parts for tractors and agricultural machinery, improve their quality, and reduce their cost to eliminate the shortage of spare parts and strictly ensure the supply of various types of spare parts to agriculture according to the established standards, while ensuring the supply of a certain number of spare parts to consumers and procurement organizations.

	It is considered necessary to establish a base for replacing spare parts and assemblies for tractors and agricultural machinery in each machine-tractor station by 1954-1955 to meet the technical needs of tractor brigades, and to establish a base for replacing spare parts and assemblies in repair shops and inter-district major repair shops to carry out major repairs of tractors, automobiles, and engines, with the number of repairs accounting for 10% of the total number of these machines.

	10. The electrification of machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms is an important factor in further strengthening the material and technical base of agriculture. The expansion of agricultural electrification depends on the better use of the electric power of existing rural power stations; the integration of machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms with industrial power systems, and the construction of new rural power stations and wind power equipment by various construction and industrial departments to build power stations and power grids. Electricity should first be used for the production of machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms.

	11. Given that the current system of in-kind wages for machine-tractor stations cannot encourage advanced collective farms to increase production, it is necessary to start paying in-kind wages for each item of work done by machine-tractor stations in collective farms from 1954, according to different standards for different regions, and to introduce a bonus system for bumper harvests.

	12. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Ministry of State Farms, should pay special attention to the more effective use of machines and tractors, improve the care of machines, increase the productivity of machines and tractors, regularly revise production norms, adapt the organization of agricultural labor to the growth of production technology, and encourage machine and tractor workers to increase labor productivity.

	13. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Ministry of Machine Building, should revise the current system of distributing new machine orders and testing new machines to quickly introduce new agricultural machines into production.

	14. Regarding the improvement of agricultural leadership

	1. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that to complete the new, large, and complex tasks in agriculture, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Ministry of State Farms, local party, Soviet, and agricultural organizations must decisively improve the leadership of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms.

	To successfully complete these tasks, it is necessary to raise the level of political and organizational work in the countryside, mobilize the creative initiative of Communist Party members, Komsomol members, all collective farmers, and workers of machine-tractor stations and state farms, and rally all the human and material resources of socialist agriculture. It is necessary to increase the sense of responsibility of our cadres for the situation in each collective farm, machine-tractor station, state farm, and each district.

	2. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that now collective farms have become large-scale, multi-sectoral economies, and machine-tractor stations, equipped with modern machinery, have become the decisive force in agricultural production. In these conditions, it is very important to further strengthen collective farms and machine-tractor stations with capable cadres who can effectively lead their departments and ensure the completion of current agricultural tasks.

	The Central Committees of the Communist Party of the Union Republics, krai party committees, and oblast party committees are instructed to select a group of mechanical engineers from industrial departments and other sectors of the national economy in 1953 and assign them to machine-tractor stations and specialized technical stations to serve as directors, chief engineers, and heads of repair shops, so that in each machine-tractor station, these positions are generally held by specialists with higher education. As for those directors who, although not having received specialized education, are actually very familiar with their business and are good at leading machine-tractor stations, they should be retained in their positions and helped to improve their professional level.

	Party organizations should explain to tractor drivers and other machine operators who have left machine-tractor stations to work in industrial enterprises, construction sites, and other departments, and call on them to return to machine-tractor stations, because if tractor drivers can now earn high and guaranteed wages in machine-tractor stations, then many former machine operators would be willing to return to work in machine-tractor stations.

	It is stipulated: for mechanical engineering personnel transferred from other sectors of the national economy to work in machine-tractor stations, as well as for tractor drivers and other machine operators who previously worked in machine-tractor stations and are now willing to return, the relevant enterprises, departments, ministries, and commissions should not obstruct their transfer.

	3. The Ministry of Culture of the USSR is instructed to transfer 6,500 engineering and technical personnel to work in machine-tractor stations to the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement by 1954-1955, including 2,500 engineers from the 1954 graduates of agricultural machinery institutes and other higher technical schools.

	4. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union noted that the current system of each agricultural specialist serving several collective farms in agricultural and animal husbandry affairs cannot meet the increasing tasks of current agriculture. In this situation, agronomists, animal husbandry specialists, and other agricultural specialists are not organizers of collective farm production, and do not directly participate in the implementation of scientific farming and animal husbandry methods and the application of scientific achievements and advanced experience in collective farms.

	To strengthen the specialized assistance of collective farms in agricultural and animal husbandry technology, it is necessary to change the previous method of assigning agronomists and animal husbandry specialists by region, and establish agronomists and animal husbandry specialists who regularly work for collective farms in machine-tractor stations, so that each collective farm has one or two agricultural specialists from the staff of machine-tractor stations regularly serving it. To serve some larger collective farms, in the staff of machine-tractor stations, each work brigade and each livestock breeding department should be assigned one specialist.

	The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Councils of Ministers of the Union Republics, krai executive committees, and oblast executive committees are instructed to dispatch 100,000 agronomists and animal husbandry specialists to machine-tractor stations to serve collective farms by the spring of 1954. The source of this manpower is from the surplus of agronomists and animal husbandry specialists with higher and secondary education after the reorganization of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and its local organizations, the abolition of the network of district agronomists in machine-tractor stations, the abolition of the network of district animal husbandry specialists and agronomists in district agricultural and procurement administrations, specialists from other organizations and institutions, and young specialists graduating from agricultural higher and technical schools.

	5. The party committees, Soviets, and agricultural organizations of krai, oblasts, and Union Republics are instructed to eliminate the lack of attention to the work of selecting and training cadres for collective farm chairmen, and to ensure the selection of politically and professionally tested specialists with higher and secondary agricultural education, as well as other experienced agricultural specialists with rich experience in leadership and organizational work, to lead large collective farm economies, to strengthen the ranks of collective farm chairmen.

	6. It should be noted that the current method of leading machine-tractor stations and collective farms by agricultural organizations is now not suitable for the growing requirements and changes in agriculture. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement and its local organizations often detach themselves from the work of collective farms and machine-tractor stations, adopt formalistic methods in deciding many important issues for the development of agriculture, do not analyze the reasons for the neglect of some important departments, and do not provide timely assistance to backward districts and collective farms.

	To improve the leadership of agriculture, to mobilize a large number of specialists working in agricultural organizations to strengthen the cadres of collective farms and machine-tractor stations, it is necessary to reorganize the work of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement and local agricultural organizations. To achieve these goals, it is necessary:

	(a) To significantly reduce the personnel of the management departments of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement and its local organizations to mobilize specialists from organizations to work in machine-tractor stations and collective farms, to ensure the improvement of the effective daily and organizational activities of agricultural organizations in leading agricultural production;

	(b) The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement should concentrate its efforts on planning the development of the main sectors of agriculture and supervising the implementation of the state agricultural plan; strengthening the leadership of agricultural propaganda and agricultural scientific institutions, and the application of scientific achievements and advanced experience in production; leading machine-tractor stations and the work of further increasing the level of mechanization of agricultural production; supplying agriculture with materials and technical equipment and allocating funds for agriculture; leading the work of storing agricultural products; selecting, assigning, and training cadres, and supervising the observance of the charter of collective farms;

	(c) The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement should lead all agricultural departments, collective farms, and machine-tractor stations within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to overcome the current incorrect situation where the Council of Ministers of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement are actually not responsible for the management of the main agricultural departments of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

	7. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that agricultural propaganda and the application of scientific achievements and advanced experience in production have not become an indispensable part of the leadership of agricultural work by the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement and local party, Soviet, and agricultural organizations. The new methods and approaches of advanced collective farms, machine-tractor stations, state farms, and agricultural production innovators are promoted in production very slowly and half-heartedly, and are not used to increase the yield of crops, improve the productivity of livestock, and increase the productivity of machine-tractor stations.

	The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Ministry of State Farms, the Central Committees of the Communist Party of the Union Republics, the Communist Party committees of krai and oblasts, the Councils of Ministers of the republics, and the executive committees of krai and oblast Soviets are instructed:

	(a) To eliminate the lack of attention to agricultural propaganda and the application of scientific achievements and advanced experience in production, and to ensure that the widespread promotion of advanced experience becomes an indispensable part of the leadership of agricultural work;

	(b) To improve the work of three-year agricultural and animal husbandry training classes, overcome formalism in the training of collective farmers and state farm workers, educate trainees to adopt advanced work methods, and ensure the improvement of production work in collective farms and state farms;

	(c) To systematically organize study classes for agricultural specialists, tractor brigade leaders, field brigade leaders, field workers, and livestock breeding workers to study new progressive work methods and approaches in the management of large farms in agricultural technology and animal husbandry.

	8. The Ministry of Culture of the USSR, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Ministry of State Farms, and local party and Soviet organizations are instructed to improve the publication of popular books on agricultural science and advanced methods, textbooks for agricultural schools and training classes, and practical teaching materials, and to organize the publication of color propaganda posters and special pamphlets introducing the achievements of advanced collective farms, state farms, machine-tractor stations, and agricultural production innovators.

	9. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Ministry of State Farms, the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge are instructed to improve the work of agricultural lectures in collective farms, state farms, and machine-tractor stations, and to attract scientists, specialists, and advanced agricultural producers to participate in this work.

	10. The Ministry of Culture of the USSR is instructed:

	(a) According to the plans and orders of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement and the Ministry of State Farms, produce the necessary number of high-quality, mainly color, educational films and popular agricultural science films; take necessary measures to directly screen educational films and popular science films in large quantities in collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms;

	(b) Significantly improve the work of disseminating agricultural scientific achievements and advanced experience through radio.

	11. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement, the Ministry of State Farms, and the Ministry of Culture of the USSR are instructed to organize the recording of lectures by advanced agricultural producers, scientists, and specialists, and to widely use gramophones to broadcast reports and discussions in collective farms, state farms, machine-tractor stations, and agricultural and animal husbandry study groups.

	12. To widely publicize the achievements of socialist agriculture, in 1954, a permanent exhibition of the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition will be held in Moscow; in male and female collective farmers and all agricultural workers, in collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, in districts, oblasts, experimental stations, and scientific research institutes, a competition will be launched to win the right to participate in the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition. Similarly, each district, oblast, krai, and republic will also hold an agricultural exhibition annually.

	13. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union noted that although agricultural science has achieved certain results, it is still lagging behind the requirements of collective farm and state farm production. Many research institutes and experimental stations work detached from reality, limiting themselves to the narrow circle of laboratories and experimental plots, and do not enrich science and practice with new discoveries and new initiatives, providing little help to collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms in improving land productivity and livestock breeding.

	The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement and the party and Soviet organizations of krai, oblasts, and republics are instructed to eliminate the shortcomings in the work of scientific research institutions, overcome the phenomenon of science lagging behind the requirements of collective farm and state farm production, increase the role of scientific institutions in providing practical help to collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, and help them further improve various sectors of agriculture. Mobilize the strength of scientists to further develop agricultural science, arming agricultural workers with new knowledge and new methods to increase labor productivity and increase agricultural production.

	14. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Procurement and local party and Soviet organizations are instructed to ensure the constant supervision of the strict observance of the charter of collective farms, not allow the waste of public land and collective farm property, take measures to eliminate poor management in collective farms, improve labor organization and discipline, and ensure that all collective farmers actively participate in the work of their collective enterprises.

	15. Currently, there are quite a few economically consolidated collective farms in the country, which have large cash and in-kind income, successfully fulfill the tasks assigned by the state, and guarantee collective farmers high product and cash remuneration for their labor days each year. The implementation of some major measures for the development of agriculture formulated by the party and the government will ensure a continuous and significant increase in the cash income of collective farmers. In this situation, with the growth of the public economy of collective farms, they can fully use part of their income to build kindergartens, nurseries, and maternity homes to create good conditions for female collective farmers, enabling them to participate in the production of collective farms and more actively participate in public life. Economically consolidated collective farms can and must allocate the necessary funds for the construction of clubs and other cultural and educational institutions. It is also suggested that collective farms help collective farmers repair and build houses and outbuildings, provide them with fruit tree seedlings to plant in their gardens, supply them with fuel, and meet other personal needs of collective farmers.

	16. Party work in the countryside

	If it is believed that the further improvement of agriculture will come automatically, that is wrong. If the work of party organizations is not improved, the material conditions and possibilities created for improving agriculture will not automatically achieve the desired results. To utilize these possibilities and conditions, party organizations should lead the masses of collective farmers, machine-tractor stations, and state farm workers, mobilize them to strive for a significant increase in agricultural production. Therefore, to successfully solve the problem of further developing agriculture, it is necessary for party organizations to strengthen organizational and political work among the masses.

	The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union noted that the activities of party organizations in the countryside have serious shortcomings. The level of political work among the masses in many collective farms is low, and political education for the working people has not been given due attention. In many collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, cultural and living services are poor. The content and methods of work of district party and Soviet organizations often do not meet the requirements for improving the leadership of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms. Although there are many party and Soviet organization workers in the districts, the responsibility of district leadership personnel for the affairs of collective farms and machine-tractor stations has not been clearly defined. The leadership of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms is mainly carried out through the method of dispatching inspectors who often do not understand agriculture during agricultural campaigns, which reduces the sense of responsibility of economic leaders for the affairs they are in charge of. District party committees do not pay enough attention to the work of party organizations in collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, often leaving them to drift, and do not rely on them in economic leadership work, so many party organizations do not play the necessary role in the work of collective farms, state farms, and machine-tractor stations, and the work of organizing the activities of activists in collective farms and workers in machine-tractor stations and state farms is poorly done. In the struggle to improve agriculture, local party organizations have underestimated the role of the Komsomol, such a large force in the countryside, and have not fully utilized it. Komsomol organizations and rural youth are not widely involved in helping to solve the problems of improving agriculture and public livestock breeding efficiency. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that the shortcomings and errors in agricultural leadership are to a large extent due to the fact that many oblast party committees, krai party committees, and Central Committees of the Communist Party of the Union Republics are not satisfactory in their leadership of districts, they do not understand the local situation well, do not provide effective help to backward districts and collective farms, abandon the leadership of machine-tractor stations, and shift all the responsibilities for the work of machine-tractor stations to the district organizations. To improve the organizational and political work of the party in the countryside, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided as follows:

	1. The oblast committees, krai committees, and Central Committees of the Communist Party of the Union Republics are instructed to significantly strengthen the leadership of political work among the masses in the countryside, ensure that the resolution is explained to all collective farmers, machine-tractor station workers, and state farm workers. Launch a widespread socialist competition to accomplish the following tasks: further develop all sectors of socialist agriculture; strengthen and comprehensively develop the public economy of collective farms; increase total and commercial production; timely fulfill the state procurement plan for agricultural products; increase the monetary and in-kind income of collective farms; improve the material well-being of collective farmers. Party organizations should rely on advanced individuals in collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, as well as experts in agriculture and livestock breeding, whose ranks will grow and expand day by day.

	The central and local newspapers are instructed to widely report on the progress of the socialist competition, the advanced experience of collective farm construction, and the situation of party and Soviet organizations leading agricultural work.

	2. The oblast committees, krai committees, and Central Committees of the Communist Party of the Union Republics are instructed to change the method of leading agriculture, eliminate all formalistic and bureaucratic leadership of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, and put an end to commandism in the leadership of collective farms. Strengthen the connection with districts and collective farms, and thoroughly understand the situation in each district.

	It is necessary to decisively increase the sense of responsibility of district executive committees for the implementation of party and government decisions and the situation of agricultural work in districts, ensure that district executive committees lead the activities of collective farms and state farms more concretely, especially the activities of machine-tractor stations, because machine-tractor stations play a huge and growing role in the development of agriculture. Take steps to strengthen the district party committees and district executive committees in the countryside by sending experienced cadres familiar with agriculture to work in these committees. These cadres should be able to correctly and scientifically lead collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms. Select some excellent workers from the institutions of oblasts, krai, and republics to strengthen the party and Soviet leadership in districts.

	3. Given that the current organizational structure of district party committees in the countryside does not meet the requirements for improving the leadership of machine-tractor stations and collective farms, and to eliminate the phenomenon of neglecting or irresponsible leadership of collective farms and machine-tractor stations, it is necessary to reorganize the work of district party organizations in this stage. The district committee should establish a group of workers led by the district party committee secretary in each machine-tractor station to conduct party political work in machine-tractor stations and the collective farms they serve. The first secretary of the district committee should lead the activities of these groups. At the same time, it is considered unnecessary to establish a deputy director for political affairs in machine-tractor stations.

	4. One of the most important tasks of the Central Committees of the Communist Party of the Union Republics and the party committees of krai, oblasts, and districts is to strengthen the party organizations of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, and increase their role in the further rise of agriculture. Ensure that Communist Party members and Komsomol members are assigned to key production positions; send trained and experienced party workers to lead the party organizations of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms.

	5. The oblast party committees, district party committees, the Central Committees of the Communist Party of the Union Republics, and the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League are instructed to increase the role of Komsomol organizations at all levels in the struggle for the further development of agriculture; ensure the involvement of rural youth in the socialist competition, and use various methods to inspire and support the initiative and valuable innovations of young people. Komsomol organizations should become the vanguard of the socialist competition, the vanguard in applying advanced work methods, agricultural science, and the latest achievements in practice in production; they should demonstrate high initiative and raise issues related to eliminating shortcomings in the work of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms to the party organizations.

	6. Since women play a huge role in the production of collective farms and state farms, the district, oblast, krai party committees, and the Central Committees of the Communist Party of the Union Republics are instructed to strengthen political, cultural, and educational work among female collective farmers, machine-tractor station workers, and state farm workers; more widely attract women to participate in the construction of collective farms and actively struggle to increase yields and develop livestock breeding.

	7. Party organizations must take into account that with the development of socialist agriculture, the cultural needs of collective farmers and workers of machine-tractor stations and state farms are also increasing, so it is necessary to strengthen the care for cultural and living services for rural residents. It is necessary to improve the work level of rural cultural and educational institutions, activate the work of clubs and libraries, regularly screen films, increase the number of radio sets in rural areas, and improve the quality of radio broadcasting work. Party organizations must conduct unremitting supervision of the work of rural medical and child welfare institutions and the activities of trade organizations and cooperatives to ensure the uninterrupted trade of all necessities of life.

	The Plenetary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that constantly caring for the improvement of the material and cultural level of collective farm workers is the most important responsibility of party organizations and Soviets at all levels.

	The Soviet state confidently moves forward to communism. An important part of the program of communist construction is: on the basis of the great development of socialist industry—the leading force of the national economy—to actually solve the task of producing abundant agricultural products in our country. Under the current conditions, this task has become an urgent task for all our people. The successful solution of this task will also promote the further consolidation of the alliance between the working class and collective farmers.

	The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union calls on all collective farmers, machine-tractor station workers, and state farm workers to contribute their strength to the task of further developing Soviet agriculture, and to demonstrate initiative.

	The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is confident that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working class, collective farmers, our intelligentsia, and all the Soviet people will complete this task in the shortest possible time.

    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议
    就赫鲁晓夫同志关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施的报告通过的决议
    一九五三年九月七日
    （一）
   在苏联共产党的领导下发展和巩固的苏联社会主义农业，是以强大的工业技术为基础的，它是世界上规模最大、机械化水平最高的农业。这种农业已无可争辩地证明了，它较之小规模的农民经济和大规模的资本主义农业生产具有决定意义的优越性。
    拥有现代技术设备的集体农庄公有经济正在不断发展，集体农庄制度正日益巩固。集体农庄和国营农场保证了农业生产率的大大提高，保证了大规模地为市场生产农产品。战后几年中，谷物的产量已经恢复并大大提高了，我们国家谷物的供应有了保证。国家采购棉花、甜菜、肉类、牛乳、羊毛和其他农产品的数量已有增加。除了交售给国家的农产品外，我们的农业还通过合作社和集体农庄的贸易机构出售大量的粮食。由于集体农庄的经济有了全面的发展，集体农庄的公有财富增加了，集体农民的现金收入和实物收入也增加了。
    在和平建设的年代中和在艰苦的战争考验的年代中，社会主义农业都能显示它的巨大的生命力，显示它为居民生产越来越多的粮食、为轻工业和食品工业生产越来越多的原料的能力。
    但是，农业生产水平没有充分满足居民对于粮食、以及轻工业和食品工业对于原料的日益增长的需要，农业生产水平与农业的技术设备和集体农庄制度中的潜力还不相称。
    现在，既然我们国内已建立了一个效能强大的技术上完善的重工业，并且集体农庄已经得到大大的巩固，那末，我们有一切条件在这种基础上保证农业各部门的迅速高涨，并且在今后两三年内大大提高对我国全体居民的粮食供应，同时保证将全体集体农民的物质福利的水平提高。
    同时，苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议指出，大规模社会主义农业的巨大潜力仍然没有充分利用。许多集体农庄和许多地区的谷物和杂粮、亚麻、甜菜、含油植物和其他作物的单位面积产量仍然不高。农业生产率的提高，饲畜业的发展，马铃薯、蔬菜、亚麻纤维、饲料谷物和其他饲料作物的生产还不能适应国民经济的要求。这些部门和其他若干重要农业部门的落后现象，阻碍了正在满足居民不可缺少的需要的轻工业和食品工业的进一步发展，并严重地妨碍了集体农庄和集体农民的收入的增加。
    至于饲畜业的发展情况，特别不能令人满意。在许多集体农庄里，这个重要的部门仍没有为市场出产大量的产品，也没有取得优厚的赢利，对于牲畜的照顾组织得不好。最近几年来，牲畜的头数增加得很慢，国内母牛的头数仍未达到战前的水平。牲畜的繁殖率也低，由于牲畜病死而造成了巨大损失；有大量的母牛不生育。集体农庄没有好好发展饲畜业的饲料基地，没有生产足够的好干草、保藏饲料、饲畜用根类作物和马铃薯。畜群没有得到令人满意的牲畜房，牲畜饲养部中的费力操作没有充分的机械化。
    农业发展中的一个巨大缺点是马铃薯和蔬菜生产的严重落后状态，这使得对城市和工业中心的居民供应这些产品的工作不能改善。马铃薯生产的落后是饲畜业进一步发展中的障碍。
    国营农场的工作中有巨大的缺点，国营农场仍没有成为示范的和赢利优厚的社会主义企业。在许多国营农场中，农作物的收获量和牲畜的产品生产率都低；仍有管理不善、巨额的非生产开支、金钱和物质的浪费的情况存在，因而实际的生产成本颇高。许多国营农场没有良好的生产建筑物，牲畜常常住在原始的、未经改善的棚子里。饲畜工作和国营农场其他若干生产部门的机械化严重地落后，房屋建筑工作的规模不够并且进行得不好。
    整个农业生产的水平不高以及许多重要农业部门的显然落后的原因何在呢？
    共产党一贯执行尽力发展作为国民经济各部门顺利发展的必要条件的重工业的方针，并已在这方面取得了巨大的成就。主要的注意力是集中在完成这个首要的国民经济任务上，而且主要的资源和财力也是用在这一方面。我国最好的干部过去是从事国家工业化的工作。我们当时没有可能在发展重工业的同时，又以很大的速度发展农业和轻工业。必须为这件事创造必要的条件。今天，我们已有了这些条件。我们已经有了强大的工业基础、巩固的集体农庄和在经济建设各方面训练有素的干部。
    一些主要农业部门的落后还有着其他原因，而造成我们工作中的缺点、农业领导中的缺点的根本原因，是由于我们自己而造成的。
    这些原因之一，首先就是因为违反了农业工作者在发展生产中、在增加自己的收入中有其物质利益这一原则，而这一原则是社会主义经营的根本原则之一。实际情况说明：在生产棉花、甜菜、茶叶、柑橘类水果中被胜利采用的这一物质利益的原则，没有推行到其他一些重要的农业部门中去。
    党和政府所制定的、按每公顷耕地或各集体农庄使用的田地面积来规定的集体农庄农作物和牲畜的义务交售原则，是从集体农庄发展一切公有经济部门的利益出发的，因而它是完全正确的。但是在实际收购工作中却歪曲了这一原则，往往是那些先进的、工作得好的、农作物获得丰收而牲畜产量也高的集体农庄向国家义务交售的产品，一般要比那些落后的、工作得不好的集体农庄多得多。
    这种不正常的情况对争取提高农作物收获量和牲畜产品生产率是不能起刺激作用的，同时也不能鼓励那些先进的集体农庄。在这样一种情况下，那些先进的集体农庄和勤恳地工作并提高了农业生产的集体农民得不到鼓励，而且他们得不到比那些不太关心巩固公有经济、提高农作物收获量和牲畜产品生产率的集体农庄和集体农民处于更加有利的地位。
    饲畜业和蔬菜、马铃薯生产发展中的落后状态，在颇大程度上是由于国家对这样一些重要的农业部门的发展没有给予足够的鼓励而造成的。一向实行的征购和购买畜产品、马铃薯、蔬菜的价格，没有能够很好地在物质利益上刺激集体农庄和集体农民来发展农业中这些重要部门。
    在许多集体农庄内，集体农庄经济的劳动组合形式的最重要原则遭到破坏。这一原则是：在私人利益服从公共利益的条件下，正确地把集体农庄中的公共利益和私人利益结合起来。按照农业劳动组合章程规定：在集体农庄中，首要的和具有决定意义的是公有经济。同时，每一个集体农庄农户有权从事不大的个人副业，以满足公有经济尚无法完全予以满足的消费需要。由于违反了这一原则，由于宅旁园地上产品的征购标准的提高，以及由于我们对集体农民个人副业税政策中的一些缺点，集体农民个人拥有的牛、猪、羊的头数减少了。这种情况不但损害了集体农民的利益，而且歪曲了集体农庄的农业劳动组合形式的性质，而集体农庄是整个社会主义时期唯一正确的集体经济的形式。
    在若干十分重要的农业部门中造成严重落后状态的主要原因之一是：社会主义国家所给予农业的强大的技术装备，没有得到完全充分的利用。在颇大数量的机器拖拉机站中，拖拉机和收割联合机的每班工作量仍然低；机器空着不使用的情况很严重；最重要的田间工作时常遭到拖延，终于造成整个收获中的损失和缺陷。目前的情况是：一方面是谷物、甜菜、棉花方面的耕种工作的高度机械化，另一方面像饲畜业和生产马铃薯、蔬菜、亚麻及其他作物之类的重要国民经济部门的机械化，却任其处于落后状态。
    直到现在还没有创造一套机器，能保证在全国各种自然条件和经济条件下使农耕工作全盘机械化。甚至在谷物耕作这样一种在耕耘、播种、收割方面都已达到高度机械化的农业生产中，还剩有谷物收割后打谷场上的一些繁重工作、糠皮和麦秸的收集和堆集、有机肥料和矿质肥料施肥方面的繁重工作没有完全机械化。在生产饲料方面，在割草工作机械化大大提高的情况下，下一步最重要的堆草工作几乎还没有机械化。在设计和生产新式农业机器工作方面，在改进大量生产的机器的构造和提高它的质量方面，还存在着严重的落后状态。
    机器拖拉机站中有些复杂的技术工作本来该由技术熟练干部来做的，现在却只是托付给那些在农忙时由各集体农庄中抽出来的一些季节性的工作人员。机器拖拉机站中的大部分领导干部没有足够的工程技术知识和农业知识，因而不能保证熟练地领导大规模的、机械化的农业生产。
    一些农业部门之所以严重落后，最主要的原因就是党、苏维埃和农业机关对集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导，首先是在选择和配置农业干部以及在乡村中进行党的政治工作方面不能令人满意。
    以现代化机器武装起来的大规模的社会主义农业的生产，只有在保持经常的熟练的领导的条件下才能得到顺利的发展。
    在实行合并之后，集体农庄已成为多部门的、复杂的经济。现在，我们已有了一切必要条件来广泛采用现代化的机器、利用苏联农学上的成就和农业先进人物和革新人物的最丰富的经验。
    这一切都要求对每个集体农庄、国营农场、机器拖拉机站、区，对每个农业部门和整个农业生产有干练的领导。这就迫切需要主持集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场和区的熟练的领导干部，农学家，机械化工程师，牲畜饲养专家，经济学家和其他一些农业专家。不具备这一最重要的条件，大规模的社会主义农业生产就不能继续前进。
    同时，在农业机关中工作的、具有高等教育或中等教育水平的三十五万专家中，有一万八千五百个专家在各集体农庄工作；有五万个专家在机器拖拉机站工作。在九万四千个集体农庄主席中，具有高等教育程度的只有二千四百人，具有中等专科教育程度的只有一万四千二百人。绝大多数的机器拖拉机站站长、总工程师和机器拖拉机站总农艺师没有受过高等教育。大部分的农学家、工程师、牲畜饲养家、兽医工作者及其他专家都分布在各个机关内，而机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场则感到熟练的农业干部的严重不足。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议同时认为：政府若干部，特别是苏联木材和造纸工业部、苏联建筑材料工业部、全苏消费合作社中央联合会、地方工业和合作社的工业部门，在以木材、砖、石灰、屋顶材料供应集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场方面所给予农业的帮助是极端不够的，因而妨碍了集体农庄和国营农场的饲畜业和其他生产用的房屋的建筑工作，同时也妨碍了机器拖拉机站内的建筑工作。
    最后，必须指出由于集体农庄本身、集体农庄主席和集体农庄管理委员会以及集体农民所造成的原因。在许多集体农庄内，劳动纪律仍然松弛，不是所有的集体农民都充分地参加集体农庄的生产。集体农民的劳动不是到处都组织得很好。对待公有财产采取不负责任的、忽视的态度这样的事实仍然不少。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议承认若干重要的农业部门中的情况是不能令人满意的，认为必须刻不容缓地采取一些重大措施，要把落后的农业部门，落后的集体农庄、国营农场和区提高到先进的水平，以保证整个社会主义经济的强大高涨。我们的任务是：在最近两三年内，要充分地满足我国居民日益增长的粮食需要，并保证轻工业和食品工业的原料供应。
    （二）进一步发展畜牧业，降低对于集体农民、工人和职员所饲养的牲畜的畜产品义务交售的标准
    集体农庄和国营农场曾在短时期内医治了战争年代给饲畜业造成的严重损失，并使牲畜头数大大地增加了。从一九四五年七月到一九五三年七月这一时期内，苏联牛的头数增加了一千一百三十万头，绵羊和山羊增加了五千三百九十万头，猪增加了二千五百一十万头，马增加了六百二十万头。
    饲畜业发展中的成就，使国家畜产品采购量得到了增加：一九五二年的肉类采购量达三百万吨，即为一九四○年的一倍半；奶类采购量达一千万吨，差不多为一九四○年的一点六倍；羊毛采购量达十八万二千吨，即为一九四○年的一倍半。
    许多国营农场和集体农庄的牲畜产品生产率已经达到了很高的水平。在科斯特罗马州的“卡拉瓦耶夫”、鄂木斯克州的“鄂木斯克”、莫斯科州的“高尔基—二”、“林中旷野”、“霍尔摩戈尔卡”等国营农场内，最近几年来，每头母牛平均每年能出产五千五百多公斤的牛奶。一九五二年，有二百多个国营农场平均每头牛出产四千多公斤牛奶。在科斯特罗马州科斯特罗姆斯克区的“十月十二日”、莫斯科州卢霍维茨区的“斯大林”、拉明区的“莫洛托夫”、亚尔干日尔州霍尔摩尔区的“新生活”及其他许多集体农庄内，在一九五一年和一九五二年内，平均每头牛出产牛奶四千多到五千多公斤，甚至更多。
    达到每只羊能产六点五到七公斤细羊毛这样高额产量的先进国营农场有：斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区的
    “苏维埃羊毛”和“布尔什维克”，阿尔泰边疆区的“鲁布佐夫”，格罗兹尼州的“切尔夫列维布鲁内”；还有斯塔夫罗波尔州的斯泰普诺伊区的“苏维埃国家”、伊帕托夫区的“第二个五年计划”两个集体农庄，以及罗斯托夫州、格罗兹尼州、阿尔泰边疆区的若干集体农庄。
    在切尔尼戈夫州切尔尼戈夫区的“世界的十月”、“新路”集体农庄内，以及在波尔塔发州和莫斯科州的若干集体农庄内，平均每一百公顷耕地有二吨到四吨的毛猪。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议同时指出，现有的公有牲畜的头数和它的产品生产率的水平还是十分不够的。全国的牛比战前水平尚少三百五十万头，比一九二八年少八百九十万头。单是一九五二年全国牛羊的总数就减少了二百二十万头，其中母牛减少了五十五万头。同时应该指出，全国马的数量也在减少：它比革命前少百分之六十，比战前一九四○年少百分之二十七。在正常的经营管理的情况下，马匹的减少本来是会使生产畜产品的牲畜的头数有大量的增加的。可是现在情况并不是这样。国家增产牲畜的计划是一年又一年地不能完成。由于对牲畜的照顾很坏，牲畜的产品生产率极低。并且最近各集体农庄中挤奶量、剪羊毛量和其他一些饲畜业的质量指标都在下降。由于牲畜的病死，集体农庄的牲畜每年遭到很大的损失，并且由于母牛不生育而达不到繁殖的目标。许多集体农庄、地方苏维埃机关和农业机关的领导人不在牲畜饲养场上组织公有牲畜繁殖的工作，却继续向集体农民大量收购牲畜。
    近几年来，哈萨克共和国、吉尔吉斯共和国、加里宁州、卡卢加州、科斯特罗马州、诺夫哥罗德州、倭罗格达州、斯摩棱斯克州、基洛夫州、新西伯利亚州和沃罗涅兹州的集体农庄和国营农场，在发展饲畜业方面产生了特别巨大的缺点。
    饲畜业就是在战前的年代里也没有能够充分地发展，也没有能够完全满足居民在肉类和乳制品方面的需要；没有能够完全满足轻工业最重要原料方面的需要。现在，当国民经济已上升到新的、更高的阶段的时候，当居民对畜产品的需求有极大的增加的时候，一直延续着的饲畜业的落后状态就变成了进一步增进劳动人民的物质福利和发展轻工业与食品工业道路上的严重障碍。
    饲畜业发展的不利情况首先是由于饲料的生产和储存工作中的落后。在许多集体农庄中牧草业发展得不够，天然饲料和种植的牧草的收获量特别低，生产块根饲料、瓜类饲料以及饲畜用玉蜀黍和向日葵等方面的工作，都处在无人照管的状态。饲畜用马铃薯的生产规模也十分不够。由于饲料作物的收获量低以及割草机械化、特别是堆草、收集和堆存谷类茎杆的机械化不够，使储存粗饲料的计划一年又一年地不能完成。牲畜饲养场中劳动生产率提高的严重障碍，就是饲畜业中的繁重工作，首先是供水和饲料制造工作仍旧没有做到充分的机械化。在各牲畜饲养场中生产力低的手工劳动仍然占着优势。
    在干旱的草原地区牲畜的供水工作也不能令人满意，这有碍于牲畜头数的增加及其产品生产率的提高。
    许多集体农庄没有完成建造牲畜房的计划，因此，到了冬季，牲畜就一起挤在设备不好的牲畜房里。
    饲畜业落后的重要原因之一就是在发展这一农业中极重要的部门时，照顾集体农庄和集体农民的物质利益不够。直到现在为止，许多集体农庄以大部分的畜产品作为义务交售定额卖给国家，而现在的肉类、牛奶、牛油、蛋类的收购价格都不是从集体农庄和集体农民在发展公有饲畜业中必要的利益出发的。
    苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、和许多地方苏维埃机关和农业机关，许多年来对发展饲畜业中的缺点默加容忍，没有采取一些应有的措施来增加饲料的生产，保证所有的牲畜都有牲畜房，扩大饲料生产工作和牲畜饲养场中费力劳动的机械化，改进牲畜的繁殖和设法保护小牲畜。科学成就和先进饲养员的经验在生产中还没有充分推广，一般还只是那些好的集体农庄和国营农场才加以采用。
    关于集体农民私有的牲畜的情况是令人不满的。许多地方党、苏维埃和农业机关显然放松了对这件事的注意，不够关心每个集体农民家庭应该在农业劳动组合章程所规定的限度以内拥有牲畜，不帮助集体农民供给他们的牲畜以饲料和牧草。
    全体会议认为，最迅速地发展饲畜业，首先是发展集体农庄和国营农场的饲畜业，对国家是非常重要的事，而且在今天是党和政府在农业方面的最迫切的任务。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议决定：
    一、认为苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、党、苏维埃和农业机关的主要任务是：消除饲畜业发展方面的不可容忍的落后状态，创立稳固的饲料基地，为牲畜和家禽建造住所，使牲畜的产品生产率迅速提高，加速增加牲畜头数，改良牲畜品种，并在今后两三年内大大地提高畜产品的产量。
    二、认为必须在一九五四年使牲畜的头数增加到如下数字：
    母牛达二千九百二十万头，牛的总数达六千五百九十万头，绵羊和山羊达一亿四千四百四十万头，猪达三千四百五十万头。
    为了增加牛奶的总产量并保证通过牲畜的繁殖来增加牲畜的数目，便迫切地需要最迅速地增加集体农庄的乳牛数目，以便在今后几年中，使得母牛数目至少占郊区集体农庄牲畜总数的百分之六十，至少占其他地区的集体农庄牲畜总数的百分之五十，使母牛数目在哈萨克、中亚细亚、南高加索、北高加索、阿斯特拉罕、契卡洛夫、赤塔州、布利亚蒙古自治共和国和图瓦自治州的草原、半沙漠区和山区的集体农场至少占牲畜总数百分之四十。假如增加乳牛的目标已经达到的话，那么增加牲畜的目标就应该被认为已经达到了。
    为了发展家禽的饲养，必须在一九五四年—一九五五年，使集体农庄拥有的家禽部，根据一定地区的情况达到每一百公顷谷类作物耕地至少饲养一百只到二百只产卵的母鸡。在草原区的集体农庄，火鸡数目也要大大增加，拥有牧场和蓄水池的集体农庄除了养鸡以外，还应该养鹅和鸭。
    集体农场的池塘养鱼业也要大大发展。
    苏联农业和农业储存部及苏联国营农场部都应在它们的计划中规定各州、各边疆区和各共和国增加牲畜及其产品生产率的目标；各共和国部长会议和各边疆区、各州和各区执行委员会应在它们的计划中规定它们各区和各集体农庄的目标。在决定这些目标时，必须考虑到一定地区集体农庄和国营农场利于发展某种牲畜的饲养而不利于发展其他牲畜饲养的经济条件和自然条件。
    三、应该严格遵守党和政府规定的按公顷计算向国家义务交售畜产品的原则。不准采取提高先进的饲畜集体农庄的任务这种有害的办法。每一区照例只能实行一种按公顷计算的交售标准。
    四、取消每年一月一日计划和计算完成发展饲畜业的任务的制度，这是不正确的制度。因为根据这种制度，集体农庄为了要报告计划完成的情形，不得不把大批非生产用的和挑选出来准备交给国家的、出卖的或食用的牲畜，保存和饲养到一月一日。应在每年十月一日计划和计算饲畜业任务完成的情形，因为那时饲料的储存、牲畜房的修理和过冬准备工作即将完成，牲畜养得正肥，并有可能保证完成向国家交售好肉的计划。
    五、苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议责成党和苏维埃机关广泛地向集体农民、工人、职员解释苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会关于提高畜产品的储备和采购价格的决定，一九五三年下半年国家采购肉类、奶类、蛋类的计划和条件的决定（这些决定的目的在于提高集体农庄、集体农民发展公有饲畜业的物质利益），以及苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会实行的降低集体农民、工人和职员私人向国家义务交售畜产品的标准。
    责成苏联农业和农业储存部、地方党、苏维埃和农业机关采取措施无条件地完成一九五三年义务交售计划和国家收购畜产品的计划。
    六、建议各集体农庄根据集体农庄全体大会的决定，可以预支给集体农民约百分之二十五出售牲畜和畜产品的款项。这笔预支款项每季支付给集体农民，有百分之十五是集体农民上季的全部劳动日的报酬，其余的百分之十是饲畜业和饲料生产的劳动日报酬。同时规定，集体农民所获得的这笔作为饲畜业和饲料生产的劳动日报酬的预支款项，在最后分配现金收入时不应减少。
    现行的以奖金奖励在饲养小牲畜、保护大牲畜及提高其产品生产率方面超额完成计划的制度，必须贯彻下去，并必须及时付给奖金。
    七、全体会议认为，在全力发展饲畜业的同时，地方党、苏维埃和农业机关应该彻底纠正那种损害集体农民在私有牲畜方面的利益的有害办法，因为集体农庄中每一农户保有一定数量的私人牲畜是增进农民物质福利和增加全国牲畜产品总量的重要条件，因此，它对于集体农民和国家都是有利的。为了使集体农民易于获得私人的牲畜，根据案卷记录凡在一九五三年七月十五日还没有私人牲畜的集体农民，在一九五三年下半年及一九五四年内都不必交售肉类。
    取消过去几年中集体农民、工人、职员向国家义务交售私人的牲畜产品的欠数，直到一九五三年一月一日为止。应该向集体农民、工人、职员解释：国家采取这一措施，一方面是为了帮助他们保存现有的私人牲畜，同时也是为了使那些没有牲畜的人容易得到牲畜。
    八、如果党、苏维埃、农业机关以及所有的农业工作者不认真着手在每一个集体农庄和国营农场建立固定的饲料基地的话，饲畜业是不可能向前推进的。在许多区和集体农庄，饲料基地的无人照管的现象到了完全不可容忍的地步。
    责成苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、地方苏维埃、农业机关及机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导者在最短时期内，消灭饲料基地无人照管的现象，要充分保证公有牲畜得到优良的干草、各种粗饲料、块根饲料、保藏饲料、生饲料、饲畜用谷物以及其他压缩饲料。
    设法扩大多年生草类、一年生草类、玉蜀黍、向日葵、块根饲料、瓜类饲料的耕种面积，并大大提高它们的单位面积产量。为此，必须采取坚决的措施以改善饲料作物的耕种技术。必须采取措施在中央黑土地带和非黑土地带各州、白俄罗斯和波罗的海各共和国、乌拉尔南部地区、西伯利亚、远东、哈萨克北部地区种植饲畜用的谷类。每一个集体农庄和国营农场必须为每头乳牛储存不少于五吨到六吨的饲料。每一个集体农庄和国营农场必须建筑在容量上能充分保证完成其饲料生产计划的饲料保藏库。由于马铃薯是上等质量的饲料，饲畜用的马铃薯的生产必须大大扩大，特别是在非黑土地带各区、乌拉尔、中央黑土地带各州和西伯利亚西部。
    集体农庄和国营农场必须广泛实行夏季露天牲畜饲养并建立牧场使用的分区制。
    必须采取措施改善对牲畜的医疗服务。指令苏联农业和农业储存部调查季节性牧场的利用情况，并在一九五四年一月一日以前将更有效和合理地使用季节性牧场的建议提交苏联部长会议审核。
    建议集体农庄供给牲畜牧放者以必要的生活和居住条件，供给他们工作服和鞋子。
    九、在割草和收集谷草的期间，根据集体农民和拖拉机队工人在割草和储存谷草中所得的劳动日单位发给报酬，其数目可达到他们所准备的、记入帐簿并为集体农庄管理委员会所承认的干草和谷草总额的百分之十；在第二次刈割天然草地的期间——百分之二十；在完成了干草储存计划的集体农庄里，根据劳动日单位，发给所储存的超过计划的干草的百分之三十。另外，在准备饲料期间，从年初开始就可根据全体集体农民的劳动日单位预先发给他们一部分收入，其数目可达到所储存干草总额的百分之五、所收集和堆积的谷草的百分之十。建议集体农庄设法使集体农民得到牧放牲畜的牧场，并帮助集体农民得到装载准备好了的饲料的运输工具。
    十、纠正许多机器拖拉机站对发展饲畜业的漠不关心的态度。在一九五四年把集体农庄割草、耙草和堆草工作机械化的水平提高到百分之六十五、把堆大草堆的工作的机械化水平提高到百分之五十；在一九五五年把割草、耙草和堆草工作的机械化水平提高到百分之八十，堆大草堆的工作，百分之六十五；在一九五四年和一九五五年，准备保藏饲料的机械化水平分别为百分之六十五和百分之七十五，种植保藏饲料作物和饲畜用块根作物的机械化水平，一九五四年为百分之七十五，一九五五年为百分之九十五，收集和堆积用联合机收割的田地上的谷草的机械化水平，一九五四年为百分之五十，一九五五年为百分之七十。
    为农业扩大下列产品的生产和供应：各种各样的割草机、耙草机、集草器、堆垛机、集草车、青储收割联合机、玉蜀黍收割机、挖掘机、挖沟机、开渗水沟设备、堆土机、筑路机、灌木伐掘机、沼泽草根截断机、铲土机、使供水机械化的唧筒、木制和金属水槽、铣铁、石绵—水泥、钢筋混凝土和煤气管、自动饮水器、索道和各种不同种类的电动机。
    责成机器制造工业部加强使饲料生产、排水和根本改善草地和牧场以及牧场的供水工作全面机械化和牲畜饲养部中费力操作过程机械化所必需的新机器和工具的设计工作。
    十一、保证使集体农庄在一九五四年建筑的牲畜房的数字如下：建筑容纳四百二十万头大牛和小牛的牛舍，一千六百三十万头羊的羊舍，四百五十万头猪的猪舍，二千七百万头家禽和三千万鸡雏的住所。
    苏联国家计划委员会规定拨出必要数量的石板、木材和其他建筑材料售给集体农庄。
    增加地方工业企业和合作社工业企业售予集体农庄的砖、瓦和石灰的产量。建议集体农庄在经济上有利的条件下用它们自己的力量和资源来生产砖、瓦和石灰。
    苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业和农业储存部以及苏联国营农场部，应在三个月内研究如何改进满足集体农庄和国营农场需要的地方伐木业，并向苏联部长会议提出建议。
    十二、为了要使国营农场的饲畜业获得巨大的发展，使它的产品生产率提高、生产成本降低，并且为了增加交售给国家的肉类、奶类、羊毛、兽皮和其他产品的数量，必须保证生产足够的、良好的干草，甘美的饲料，并且大大地增加国营农场自己所生产的压缩饲料。建筑工作必须坚决加以改善，
    一切牲畜必须有经过改善的住所。在今后两三年中，使国营农场各部门的生产全部机械化。在一九五四—一九五五年中，为国营农场工人和其他职工建筑必需数量的住宅、学校和其他文化和服务机关所需的建筑物。苏联国家计划委员会应在每年计划中指拨必需的经费、材料和设备。
    十三、苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议要求地方党的机关注意，必须坚决加强对饲畜业发展的领导。公有饲畜业是农业中最复杂的一个部门，需要经常的注意和胜任的领导。党的机关一定要改变对饲畜业、特别是对落后的集体农庄和国营农场的饲畜业不闻不问的态度。必须运用一切力量来尽速掌握大规模饲畜业的管理技术及其经济学，为农业中的这个主要部门训练许多熟练的干部。必须适当地分配党和共产主义青年团的力量，以便能以成千个党员和团员来加强饲畜业工作者的队伍。
    如果一切地方党、苏维埃和农业机关，农业专家和组织者，共产党员和青年团员，一切集体农民和机器拖拉机站及国营农场工人坚决地、坚持不渝地发展饲畜业，并且为达到这个目的而不惜付出一切精力和资源，我们的国家将在今后两三年中，获得居民所需要的许多肉类、奶类、牛油、蛋类和其他牲畜产品，以及轻工业及食品工业所需的主要原料。
    （三）增加集体农庄和国营农场的马铃薯和蔬菜的生产量及交售量
    我们的国家有生产马铃薯和蔬菜的巨大的可能性。先进的集体农庄和国营农场利用这些可能性获得了大量的马铃薯、白菜、番茄、黄瓜和其他蔬菜。伊凡诺佛州舒耶区斯大林集体农庄每公顷平均获得三十吨蔬菜和四十五吨白菜。这个集体农庄的最好的小组能在每公顷土地上获得五十吨白菜和胡萝卜、三十二吨黄瓜。基辅州切尔诺比尔区斯大林集体农庄每公顷马铃薯收获量达六十点七吨。莫斯科州高尔基国营农场某些地段每公顷白菜的产量达八十到一百吨，胡萝卜的产量达四十到六十吨。
    然而，利用增加马铃薯和蔬菜产量的可以利用的可能性的情况，还不能令人满意，已经积累起来的关于提高这些作物收获量的最好的经验，还没有被充分地利用。
    许多集体农庄和国营农场在不肥沃的土地上栽种马铃薯，而且栽得非常迟。有时，每公顷的栽种量没有达到标准。马铃薯和蔬菜的行间耕耘组织得很坏。过晚的和不好的收获工作造成了很大的损失。由于地方苏维埃和农业机关的纵容，在集体农庄中形成了对待储藏栽种用的马铃薯的不正确的态度。栽种用的马铃薯没有在气候最适合的九月份，而是在潮湿多雨、早霜初降的十月和十一月收藏。结果，收藏起来的马铃薯受潮了，或者是微微冻坏了，也没有加以分类，于是，很大一部分在储藏时期变坏了。
    温床和温室的设备发展得很差，结果冬季和春季生产的蔬菜很少，白菜、番茄和其他蔬菜的菜秧培育得不够。
    集体农庄和国营农场在生产马铃薯和蔬菜方面的严重落后状态，首先是由于若干年以来，苏联农业和农业储存部及苏联国营农场部没有在马铃薯和蔬菜生产方面提出并解决像下面这样的基本问题：使马铃薯和蔬菜的栽种、中耕和收获机械化，改进栽种方法，以及给集体农庄和国营农场以更大的经济上的鼓励以使它们生产这些作物等。
    机器拖拉机站很少从事于马铃薯和蔬菜的生产。而在种植谷物方面，有百分之九十到百分之九十五的主要工作是由机器拖拉机站完成的。去年机器拖拉机站只做了集体农庄栽种马铃薯工作的百分之四十，只做了不到马铃薯收获工作的百分之六，而在蔬菜种植方面，几乎没有作什么工作。直到最近马铃薯和蔬菜的生产还是以人力劳动为基础，而在经济上得不到充分的鼓励，这不可能不、而且实际也形成了严重的落后。
    科学成就和先进经验的应用，是胜利发展马铃薯和蔬菜生产的主要条件之一。苏联农业和农业储存部与苏联国营农场部以及它们的地方机关，对种植马铃薯和蔬菜的新的先进方法，首先是对这些作物的方形簇种法和在泥炭腐植容器内培育菜秧的方法，抱有保守的态度。这些在多年以前就研究出来的而且效率很高的方法，长期没有介绍给集体农庄和国营农场加以大规模的采用。一九五三年用方形簇种法种植马铃薯的土地，仅有三十一万八千公顷，为种植马铃薯的全部土地的百分之十弱。用泥炭腐植容器来培育菜秧的方法，仅为某些先进的集体农庄和国营农场所采用。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议认为，在马铃薯和蔬菜生产方面的主要任务是：通过广泛的机械化和先进的农业方法的应用来大大增加这些作物的收获量。任务是：在今后两三年中，使马铃薯和蔬菜的生产不但能充分满足城镇人民和工业中心以及加工工业的需要，而且可以满足饲畜业对马铃薯的需要。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议决定：
    一、为了进一步增加马铃薯和蔬菜生产，在一九五四年把种植马铃薯和蔬菜的面积增加如下：
    （甲）在集体农庄——马铃薯，四百一十二万八千五百公顷，蔬菜，一百万零三千四百公顷。保证在集体农庄的受灌溉的土地上种植马铃薯十五万三千一百公顷，种植蔬菜二十八万四千二百公顷；
    （乙）在苏联国营农场部所属的国营农场——马铃薯，二十一万八千公顷，蔬菜，七万二千五百公顷；在苏联食品工业部所属的国营农场——马铃薯，四万四千公顷，蔬菜，两万公顷。
    二、规定一九五四年每公顷马铃薯和蔬菜的收获量不得少于：
    （甲）在集体农庄——马铃薯，十四吨；白菜，十七吨半；黄瓜，十一吨；番茄，十三吨半；葱，八吨半；胡萝卜，十二吨；食用甜菜，十三吨；
    （乙）在国营农场——马铃薯，十四吨；白菜，二十一吨；黄瓜，十一吨半；番茄，十六吨半；葱，十吨；胡萝卜，十三吨半；食用甜菜，十五吨半。
    三、指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、地方苏维埃和农业机关、集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站大大增加马铃薯的生产，特别是在条件非常有利的苏联欧洲部分的中央地区。苏联农业和农业储存部、地方苏维埃和农业机关必须实行一系列的措施，来提高苏联欧洲部分的中央各区的马铃薯收获量，并首先保证：
    （甲）广泛采用马铃薯种植的方形簇种法，使这种作物的中耕和收获工作极度机械化；
    （乙）把马铃薯分布在最好的土地上，包括受洪水泛滥的土地在内；
    （丙）扩大受灌溉土地上的马铃薯种植；
    （丁）大大增加肥料的使用，特别是粪肥。
    四、规定苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、各共和国、边疆区和州的苏维埃和农业机关执行下列任务：保证在一九五四年和一九五五年使集体农庄和国营农场马铃薯和蔬菜的中耕和收获的主要工作的机械化，达到如下的水平（按对工作总量的百分比）：一九五四年集体农庄的马铃薯种植、中耕和收获工作的机械化——占百分之四十到百分之六十五；国营农场——百分之八十到百分之九十。一九五五年马铃薯的种植、中耕和收获工作的机械化水平，在集体农庄要提高到百分之八十到百分之九十，在国营农场要提高到百分之九十
    五。
    把一九五四年各集体农庄蔬菜种植的机械化程度提高到百分之五十，菜秧种植——百分之三十五，蔬菜的行间中耕——百分之七十。把国营农场这些工作的机械化程度提高到百分之八十到百分之八十五。把一九五五年各集体农庄蔬菜种植的机械化程度提高到百分之八十到百分之九十，菜秧种植——百分之七十到百分之八十，蔬菜行间中耕——百分之八十到百分之九十。保证一九五五年各国营农场的全部种植蔬菜工作的机械化程度提高到百分之九十五。
    五、指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、地方苏维埃和各农业机关、机器拖拉机站的站长和国营农场的场长，保证广泛地采用马铃薯种植和蔬菜播植的方形簇种法，这种方法使得它们的中耕工作在两个方向实行机械化成为可能。保证一九五四年各集体农庄和国营农场马铃薯、番茄和白菜的种植一般地都采用方形簇种法。因为在一九五四年仍然没有足够的马铃薯种植机供整个地区实行机器种植，因此马铃薯的方形簇种还要广泛地使用犁、中耕机和其他的农具。
    六、广泛地利用泥炭腐植容器培植菜秧的方法，因为这种方法可大大地增加收获量和保证蔬菜的早熟。指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、地方苏维埃和各农业机关保证，从一九五四年起，在各集体农庄和国营农场中都要制造泥炭腐植容器和在容器中培植菜秧。地方苏维埃机关要给各集体农庄分配制造泥炭腐植容器的任务，并督促这些任务的完成。
    七、为了使马铃薯和蔬菜的种植和收割工作广泛地全面机械化，要为农业生产下列的机器和工具：马铃薯四行方形簇种机；一种装有施肥附件的四行中耕培土机；霍茨——七式拖拉机曳引的中耕和施肥机；马铃薯挖掘联合机；一种割叶的器具；一种霍茨——七式拖拉机曳引的菜种条播机；菜秧方形种植机；一种制造带有机械化供料和搅拌设备的泥炭腐植容器的机器；一种由霍茨——七式拖拉机曳引的撒水和喷雾机；一种人造雨喷射器；一种拖拉机上用的吊挂式万能装载机；各种施粪肥、泥炭、矿质肥料和石灰的施肥机；自动喷射液体有机肥料和矿质肥料溶液的喷雾器，车身很大的运输蔬菜、马铃薯、有机肥料和矿质肥料的自动卸货卡车和其他许多机器。
    八、苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议指令党和苏维埃机关要广泛地向集体农民、工人和职员们说明苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会所通过的“关于一九五三年收购和购买马铃薯和蔬菜的国家计划和提高这些产品的收购价格”的决议以及“发展集体农庄在马铃薯和蔬菜方面的贸易”的决议，这些决议的目的是用一切方法扩大马铃薯和蔬菜的生产来增加各集体农庄和集体农民们的物质利益。
    九、为了增加各集体农庄在蔬菜生产方面的利益，降低各集体农庄向国家义务交售这些作物的标准和提高国家的购买价格，指令苏联农业和农业储存部、各加盟共和国部长会议、各边疆区和州的执行委员会，起草集体农庄和集体农民农户向国家义务交售马铃薯的区内适用的新标准和集体农庄义务交售蔬菜的新标准，并在一个月之内呈请苏联部长会议批准。
    在拟订新标准时，栽种马铃薯和蔬菜条件相差不多的地区的标准，以后不容许有很大的变更，城市和工业中心附近地区的义务交售标准只能比其他地区稍微高一点。
    十、为了最迅速地增加城市和工业中心附近的蔬菜生产量，指令各共和国部长会议、边疆区和州的执行委员会，效法莫斯科州的范例，拟定具体措施，把蔬菜栽种集中在受洪水泛滥的地区、低地和排去了积水的泥炭地，使蔬菜栽种工作机械化，并且在这个基础上增加蔬菜生产量。
    十一、有鉴于增加国营农场马铃薯和蔬菜生产量的极端重要，指令苏联国营农场部在一九五三—一九五四年再指定一百五十四个国营农场，苏联食品工业部再指定七个国营农场转而生产蔬菜和马铃薯。
    十二、指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、各共和国部长会议、边疆区和州的执行委员会，保证完成一九五三年国民经济计划所规定的在集体农庄和国营农场内建筑温床和温室的任务。
    在一九五四年，集体农庄和国营农场开始使用九百十九万七千个温床架和面积达五十一万四千五百平方公尺的温室，在一九五五年，开始使用一千一百八十九万六千个温床架和面积达七十四万五千四百平方公尺的温室。一九五四年，集体农庄和国营农场要建筑二百七十八万九千个温床架和面积达二十五万二千平方公尺的温室，一九五五年，要建筑二百八十五万八千个温床架和面积达三十六万二千平方公尺的温室。
    规定集体农庄和国营农场广泛地使用以蒸气、水和电力加热的温床和温室，大规模利用工业机构剩余的热力来给温床、温室和土壤加热。
    认为必须效法莫斯科工业机构集体农庄的范例，照顾、帮助集体农庄用集体农庄的资源来建筑温床和温室。指令苏联国家计划委员会在国民经济计划中规定为集体农庄和国营农场生产建筑温床和温室必需的材料和部件，把这些出售给它们并且以燃料供给它们。
    十三、在指出供应做种用马铃薯的工作中的严重缺点并指责了规定减低栽种标准的有害措施后，指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、地方苏维埃和农业机关以及集体农庄和国营农场的行政人员采取必要的措施，以便从一九五三年这次收获起，集体农庄和国营农场以自己的品质很高的做种用马铃薯，来满足它们自己的全部要求，并且绝不使栽种标准降低。规定在大规模收获开始的时候，每个集体农庄和国营农场必须把做种用的马铃薯储藏起来。
    十四、在一九五三年，胜利地收获、收购和购买马铃薯和蔬菜，对于以这些作物供应居民的工作是非常重要的。指令苏联农业和农业储存部、全苏消费合作社中央联合会、各共和国部长会议、边疆区和州委员会保证胜利完成收购和购买马铃薯和蔬菜的计划。尽力帮助集体农庄组织收获工作，特别是使收获工作机械化，并且尽力帮助它们把马铃薯和蔬菜从田间和集体农庄的仓库运到交售站、码头和火车站。
    苏联交通部、苏联海上和内河航运部和苏联汽车运输部，应以运输工具供给那些已完成马铃薯和蔬菜义务交售计划及实物支付计划的集体农庄，为它们运输拿到集体农庄市场上去出卖的产品。
    十五、为了更充分地并正确地利用拨给集体农庄种植马铃薯和蔬菜的矿质肥料，规定在一九五三年和一九五四年内以这些作物的矿质肥料贷给集体农庄，集体农庄以后可以拿本年收获的马铃薯或一种蔬菜付还。责成苏联农村汽车运输处、机器拖拉机站从国家仓库运输矿质肥料、并责成机器拖拉机站和集体农庄把这些肥料施放到田地上去。
    十六、认为必须加强集体农庄和国营农场蔬菜种植组，组织集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工人学习种植蔬菜和马铃薯的最好的劳动方法，在每一个集体农庄和国营农场中，训练操使马铃薯种植机、植苗机和其他机器的人员。
    通过训练班、无线电和电影、出版物和布置特别讲座和座谈会，使所有集体农民和机器拖拉机站及国营农场的工人们熟悉现代化的设备和马铃薯及蔬菜的种植方法。掌握这种技术是使蔬菜和马铃薯的种植、中耕和收获工作顺利机械化的一个决定性的条件。
    十七、指令各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、苏联共产党边疆区和州委员会、党的区委会和在集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的党的基层组织坚决改进在发展蔬菜和马铃薯生产方面的领导工作。种植蔬菜是农业中的复杂部门之一。要正确地领导这个部门，就必须了解它。一个党的领导人，如果不知道种植马铃薯和蔬菜的机械化和科学的耕作方法，也不知道方形簇种法、播种法和其他农业的技术措施的本质，那末，他就不能领导保证进一步发展蔬菜和马铃薯种植的工作。全体会议要求党的领导者们使蔬菜和马铃薯的生产得到迅速的发展。
    （四）关于提高谷物、工业作物和含油作物的单位面积产量
    在发展谷物生产方面已取得了显著的成就。和一九四零年相比，最贵重的粮食作物小麦的播种面积已增加了八百一十万公顷。像乌克兰、北高加索和克里米亚这些在战争中受到了严重创伤的重要产粮地区，已迅速地恢复了它们的农业并大大地增加了谷物、特别是冬小麦的生产量。许多集体农庄和国营农场每公顷收到一百五十到二百普特或者更多的小麦。
    甜菜、向日葵和许多工业作物的播种面积已经恢复和扩大了。甜菜播种面积的扩大和它的单位面积产量的提高，保证能更充分地满足消费者对于食糖的需要。在棉花生产方面，特别是在乌兹别克、塔吉克和土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国已取得了巨大的成就。因此，我们国家的工业现在出产的棉织品比战前多得多。
    同时，苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议指出，在谷物、工业作物和含油作物生产方面虽然取得了显著的成就，但仍然存在着一些重大的缺点。许多集体农庄和国营农场、特别是在非黑土地带各区、中央黑土地带各州、伏尔加河流域和西伯利亚的谷物、含油作物、豆科作物和长纤维亚麻的单位面积产量仍然低。乌克兰各集体农庄近年来玉蜀黍的播种面积和它的单位面积产量已经减少。
    农作物单位面积产量低的主要原因，是机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场的工作质量不能令人满意，以及许多苏维埃机关和农业机关、机器拖拉机站站长、国营农场场长、集体农庄主席轻视科学耕作的问题。
    许多机器拖拉机站未能迅速进行田间工作、工作质量的标准又低、没有完成秋耕的计划，因此，颇大一部分春季作物是种植在春季犁耕的田地上的。春播工作的拖延，已到了不能容许的程度。休耕地犁得颇迟，中耕工作也做得不好、冬季作物播种得颇迟。播种不分等级的和劣等的种子、每公顷播种数量少于标准定额的恶习，还没有完全根除。
    像谷物的窄行播种法和交义播种法，玉蜀黍、向日葵和其他作物的方形簇种法等先进科学耕作方法虽然在实际工作中已充分证明很有成效，但是并没有广泛地加以采用。最好的和最丰产的品种没有积极加以推广。荞麦、粟、长纤维亚麻、多年生草类和一年生草类的良种的生产，处于被忽视的状态。
    许多地方党组织在群众中没有进行适当的工作来推广先进的科学耕作方法，没有好好地组织集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工人在最适宜的时间以高度的工作质量完成全部耕耘和收割作物的工作。
    许多区的谷物、含油作物和工业作物单位面积产量低的主要原因之一，是没有充分使用有机肥料和矿质肥料，特别是粪肥、泥炭、和泥炭混合肥料。由于缺乏贮藏粪肥的地点，集体农庄的粪肥就保藏得不好，它的效力因而减低了。在白俄罗斯共和国、布利安斯克州、斯摩棱斯克州、维利基鲁基州和其他一些州，没有充分播种可供绿肥用的羽扇豆、塞拉德拉豆和其他作物。在酸性土壤和白色灰状土壤地区的大多数集体农庄没有用石灰使土壤中和。
    由于对谷物、含油作物和工业作物的照顾不及时和不好，以及收获工作中的损失，许多集体农庄和国营农场损失了大量的农产品。
    机器拖拉机站在限期的遵守和工作的质量上还未受到监督。监督机器拖拉机站拖拉机的工作质量的国家检查员——区农业管理处的总农艺师、各共和国农业部的总农艺师和高级农艺师，以及边疆区和州的农业管理处总农艺师——没有过问机器拖拉机站的工作，没有执行他们的监督任务。还存在着一种计划单位面积产量的惯例，根据这个惯例，先进的集体农庄和它们的田间工作队被指定要达到特别高的单位面积产量目标，这就使得集体农民和机器拖拉机站的拖拉机手不可能因卓著成效的工作而获得额外收入，这种做法是错误的。
    为了更进一步增加谷物、工业作物和含油作物的总产量和商品产量，苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议兹决定：
    一、鉴于谷物生产是所有农业生产的基础，有必要最充分地发展谷物生产，特别是最贵重的粮食作物冬小麦和春小麦的生产，其方法是进一步提高主要产麦区以及中央黑土地带和伏尔加河流域右岸的单位面积产量。应该增加东南部、哈萨克和西伯利亚西部的硬小麦生产。
    二、指令苏联农业和农业储存部、地方苏维埃和农业机关采取措施，来消除谷物生产，特别是荞麦与粟的生产方面的落后状态。
    为了增加集体农庄和集体农民种植荞麦和粟的利益，准许集体农庄：
    （甲）以荞麦代替其它粮食交售给国家并作为机器和拖拉机服务的实物支付，比率是一百公斤的荞麦合二百公斤裸麦或二百五十公斤小麦。建议集体农庄以实物奖金发给集体农民以及机器拖拉机站的耕作人员，其数目可达到该集体农庄规定荞麦产量目标超出数额的百分之五十。不论集体农庄的谷物总收成如何，不论向政府交售谷物的情况如何，奖金照样发给；
    （乙）用粟代替其他粮食交售给国家并作为对机器拖拉机站服务的实物支付，比率是一百公斤粟合一百零五公斤小麦或一百二十五公斤裸麦。建议集体农庄以实物奖金奖给集体农民和机器拖拉机站的耕作人员，其数目可达到该集体农庄规定粟的产量目标超出数额的百分之五十，不论集体农庄全部谷物的收获量及其向国家交售谷物的完成情况如何。
    责成苏联农业和农业储存部广泛地在各研究所和实验站进行小米（粟的一种品种）的试验，以便确定适合于各地情况的产量最高的品种，并研究出一套小米的种植方法，以便把这一产量极高的谷物推广到集体农庄和国营农场去。
    三、指令苏联农业和农业储存部以及南部、南高加索，中亚细亚和远东各州和共和国的地方党组织、苏维埃和农业机关，采取各种措施以大大增加稻米的产量，并扩大植稻区，保证及时作好灌溉渠网的准备工作，改进种植方法，并在最适宜的时节进行收割。
    要特别注意豆科作物（豌豆、大豆等）的生产，这对改进人民食品的供应具有重大的意义。
    四、增加谷类饲料作物：玉蜀黍、大麦和燕麦的产量，这对于解决牲畜饲养问题具有重大的意义。
    在今后两三年中，这种作物的生产必须加以发展，使它能以足够的谷类饲料供给集体农庄和国营农场的牲畜。
    在黑土和非黑土地带的南部、东南部和中部，玉蜀黍的种植面积必须扩大。为了增加玉蜀黍的单位面积产量，必须广泛地运用方形簇种法，这样将节省很多劳动力，并且保证中耕工作的机械化，从而提高单位面积产量。同时也必须坚决地过渡到种植杂种玉蜀黍。
    五、苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议认为，为了增加棉花产量，集体农庄和国营农场必须大大地提高单位面积产量，必须开垦荒地以及耕耘新灌溉的土地，以扩大这种作物的种植面积，同时必须改进土壤的条件。必须加紧培育出适应一定土壤和气候的地区的情况及适合于机器耕作的各种产量高的、早熟的中纤维和长纤维棉花新品种。
    指令苏联农业和农业储存部及地方苏维埃和农业机关采取措施，以更好地利用现有的采棉机，并指令机器制造工业部采取措施，在一九五四—一九五五年设计出更优良的新型采棉机和棉柴收割机。
    六、指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、地方苏维埃和农业机关采取措施，改进甜菜的耕作方法，使收获工作机械化，使用肥料和采取必要措施来消灭影响甜菜收获量的病虫害，以进一步增加这种作物的产量。
    为了使甜菜的收获和装卸工作进一步机械化，苏联机器制造工业部与农业和农业储存部应大大增加甜菜联合机的产量，并在一九五三—一九五四年设计出几种装卸机器，以便在一九五四年便着手生产这些机器，并在所有种植甜菜的集体农庄和国营农场中使用。
    七、亚麻和大麻种植区的党、苏维埃和农业机关的重大任务就是：扩大亚麻和大麻的种植面积；并大大增加这两种作物的单位面积产量和商品产量。必须改进亚麻和大麻的栽种方法：在种过最适宜的前作物之后再播种这两种作物，根本改良种籽的培育，及时和有效地进行收割并对亚麻和大麻进行初步加工，以尽量减少损失，进一步使这种作物的中耕和收获工作的主要操作机械化。
    必须在亚麻和大麻工厂里建造机械化的亚麻、大麻处理车间以及亚麻去皮车间，以便保证在一九五五年全部亚麻干茎和枝叶的商品产量有百分之八十五到九十完全交由亚麻工厂加工。
    八、指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、各共和国部长会议、地方苏维埃及农业机关采取措施，进一步增加向日葵的产量，并扩大哈萨克、西伯利亚及乌拉尔地区种植亚麻的土地的面积，保证以科学的耕作方法种植含油作物，包括在向日葵和蓖麻子的种植方面广泛使用方形簇种法，并使这种作物的中耕和收割机械化。保证培育并推广新的、早熟的、含油量丰富的、抗疫性强的含油作物品种。
    九、指令苏联农业和农业储存部、各共和国部长会议、地方苏维埃及农业机关：
    （甲）采取必要措施，尽量扩大种植鲜果与浆果的土地面积，切实完成一九五三年设立新果园、葡萄园和浆果园的计划，以确保一九五四年、一九五五年种植鲜果和浆果的土地面积得以大大增加。
    整顿现有的果园、葡萄园、浆果园，在任何情况下都不得容许它们因照顾不当而荒芜，确保一九五四年浆果、葡萄及其它鲜果丰收；
    （乙）增加种植西瓜和蜜瓜的土地面积，这是由于有必要在一九五四年比一九五三年大量增加对全国各地工业中心的西瓜和蜜瓜的供应。
    十、指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、地方苏维埃及农业机关：
    （甲）消除不重视培育多年生和一年生牧草种籽的现象，确保每一个集体农庄和国营农场的多年生和一年生牧草种籽可以自给自足，并且也为市场培育这些作物的种籽，主要是在多年以来牧草种籽的收获量一直很高的地区；
    （乙）保证在一九五三年完成集体农庄和国营农场要在明春播种的全部田地的秋耕工作，并保证完成秋耕休闲计划。保证在一九五四年四月和五月犁耕要在一九五五年栽种冬季作物的休耕地，特别是要在一九五六年栽种冬季作物的秋耕休闲地；在一九五四年六月和七月犁耕西伯利亚和南乌拉尔要在一九五五年播种春小麦的休耕地。
    在有足够湿度地区，特别是黑土和非黑土地带的地区以及乌克兰的森林草原地区，在半休耕地上种植冬季谷物可能得到很好的收获者，将在未来几年中把这些地区的全休耕地逐渐变成半休耕地，在上面种植一些早收作物。
    十一、保证更多地积存和使用本地肥料（粪肥、泥炭、液化粪肥和各种腐坏植物肥料等）。在有泥炭矿的地区，增加泥炭生产，作为肥料和垫厩之用。大规模地组织腐坏植物肥料和有机矿物混合肥料的调制和使用，以便在两三年内使集体农庄的有机肥料使用量比一九五二年增加百分之五十到百分之一百。
    指令化学工业部与冶金工业部在一九五四至一九六三年增加生产矿物肥料的能力（以标准单位计算），在一九五九年增到一千六百五十万到一千七百五十万吨，在一九六四年增到二千八百万到三千万吨。一九五五年，粒状过磷酸盐的产量增加到占过磷酸盐总产量的百分之四十五，一九五八年增加到百分之六十。保证从一九五六年起，只以粒状的硝酸盐供给农业。拟订在农业方面广泛地使用希宾尼磷灰石和当地的磷灰土的计划。
    指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、地方苏维埃和农业机关采取措施，消除贮藏损耗现象，改进贮藏设备和改善矿质肥料的利用情况。
    十二、中和酸性土壤，在咸性土壤的地区使用石膏，是提高单位面积产量的重要方法。在这方面，要指令各加盟共和国部长会议保证从一九五四年起，在建筑材料工业、地方工业及生产合作社的企业中大大增加石灰产量以供农业之需，同时，努力降低石灰的售价。
    十三、在两三年内，把化学杀虫剂、特别是滴滴涕、六六六和古乐生的生产量增加为一九五三年计划的两倍，在以后几年内，组织含磷有机制剂的生产，以充分满足农业对防治植物病虫害的化学药品的需求。在以后两年中，更多地生产并供给农业高效率的灭虫机器和装置，作为集体农庄、国营农场以及集体农民和职工的宅旁园地防治植物病虫害之用。
    （五）进一步改进机器拖拉机站的工作，使它们在发展集体农庄生产中发挥更大的作用
    机器拖拉机站是集体农庄制度的工业的、物质的技术的基础，在今天，它们是发展集体农庄生产的决定性的力量，是社会主义国家赖以对集体农庄实行领导的最重要的机关。近几年来，在农业机械化方面已经取得了很大的成就。机器拖拉机站得到了许多最新式的设备，于是便有可能使许多费力操作机械化，减轻集体农民的劳动，并大大提高劳动生产率。
    这些具有高度技术设备水平的机器拖拉机站起着组织的作用，它们是一些庞大的国家企业，集体农庄大约四分之三的耕作工作要靠它们来做。所以，要大大提高集体农庄各方面的生产工作，首先要依靠机器拖拉机站。
    同时，苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议注意到在机器拖拉机站的工作中存在着严重的缺点。许多机器拖拉机站没有熟练的拖拉机手，没有熟练的拖拉机队的队长，没有熟练的机器工人和其他工人。机器拖拉机站的机器操使者工作过于繁忙。苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议认为，在目前机器拖拉机站已成为拥有复杂机器设备的巨大国营企业的情况下，它们没有固定的机器操使者是不对的。
    目前，机器拖拉机站训练人员的制度有着严重的缺点。没有足够的机械学校来满足对于机器操使者的需要，因而，机器拖拉机站不得不在短期训练班中训练拖拉机手、联合机驾驶员和拖拉机队的其他工人，这就普遍地降低了训练的质量。
    许多区、边疆区和共和国的党组织、苏维埃和农业机关对选择、配置和训练机器拖拉机站行政人员的工作，没有给予应有的注意。并没有利用机会吸收工业和科学机构中的技术人员到机器拖拉机站来工作。
    因此，有许多机器拖拉机站的站长、修理工厂的总工程师和管理人员都是只有实际经验而没有受过专门教育的人。机器拖拉机站和专门技术站缺少受过较高程度的农艺和动物饲养教育的专家来为集体农庄工作。
    大多数机器拖拉机站的修理和存放拖拉机及农业机器的工作，都组织得非常不好。许多机器拖拉机站没有修理工场、必要的设备、机器停放房或停放农业机器的敞棚以及其他生产用的房屋和为工作人员服务的房屋。
    机器拖拉机站的材料和技术供应工作也组织得不能令人满意。工业部门没有把足够数量的零件、工具、油箱、金属和其他物资及时地供给机器拖拉机站，因此使得机器拖拉机站工作队的工作受到严重的阻碍。
    为了进一步改进机器拖拉机站的工作，并且使它们在使集体农庄一切生产工作机械化方面发挥更大的作用，苏联共产党中央委员会决定：
    一、规定机器拖拉机站的主要任务是：用一切可能的办法增加集体农庄一切作物的单位面积产量，保证增加公有牲畜的头数，同时并提高牲畜的产品生产率，增加它们所服务的集体农庄的农产品和牲畜的总产量以及商品产量。机器拖拉机站必须完成农作物田间耕作的机械化，在饲畜业以及马铃薯和其他蔬菜的生产中更进一步实行费力劳动的机械化，把科学的成就和最先进的方法运用到集体农庄生产中去，并且保证在组织上和经济上进一步巩固集体农庄，从而增进集体农民的物质福利。
    二、认为党组织、苏维埃和农业机关的最重要的任务就是：供给机器拖拉机站以固定的机器操使者，这些人需要能够最充分地、最有成效地利用装备，从而能够确使集体农庄各部门的生产进一步地、强有力地高涨。
    为了完成这项任务，特决定：在机器拖拉机站、专门技术站中，使拖拉机手、拖拉机队队长和他们的助手、挖掘机操使者及他们的助手、保持记录的装燃料的工人都成为固定工人，并列入机器拖拉机站的编制，那些照料拖拉机曳引的农业机器和掘泥机的人以及联合机助理操使者，将作为季节性工人列入机器拖拉机站的编制。
    指令苏联农业和农业储存部、地方党组织、苏维埃和农业机关，在最近的将来确使所有机器拖拉机站配备有固定工人，并组织在全年适当地雇用拖拉机手以及拖拉机队的其它固定工人。为了这个目的，应该鼓励拖拉机手、联合机操使者、机器操使者以及其它固定工人学会几种行业。在农闲的时候，拖拉机队的固定队员应该被雇用于修理厂以及进行饲畜业机械化工作的装配队，被雇用来从事建筑工作和其它工作。
    三、除了建立固定的工资制度并鼓励拖拉机队的工人以外，还有必要：
    （甲）依地区的不同，规定机器拖拉机站拖拉机队工人的现金工资如下：拖拉机手、拖拉机队队长和他们的助手，每一劳动日单位五到八卢布；保持记录的装燃料工人，每一劳动日单位三到四卢布；联合机助理操使者，每一劳动日单位四到六卢布；拖拉机曳引的机器操使者，每一劳动日单位二卢布五十戈比；
    （乙）规定机器拖拉机站和专门技术站按实际收获量，把现行的有保证的最低限额的实物工资，发给拖拉机队工人作为劳动日单位报酬，而集体农庄则把根据现行的有保证的最低限额应给拖拉机队工人的粮食交给收购机构；
    （丙）机器拖拉机站和专门技术站对于拖拉机队的固定工人在修理工场的工作和使饲畜部机械化方面的工作，应按照苏联农业和农业储存部规定的工资率和按件计算工资率付出工资；
    （丁）对于在集体农庄中没有宅旁园地的机器拖拉机站和专门技术站拖拉机队的拖拉机手和其他固定工人，给以宅旁园地。
    四、为了改进训练熟练机器操使者的制度，必须采用在工业职业学校中训练机器操使者的制度。所以，现有的机械化学校将改组为农业机械学校，以培养下列的专门人材：
    （甲）学习驾驶柴油拖拉机、联合机、复杂农业机器达一年的并掌握机械学的拖拉机手与机器操使者；
    （乙）学习驾驶履带式与轮转式拖拉机及农业机器达半年并掌握机械学的拖拉机手；
    （丙）学习驾驶自动推进联合机与拖拉机曳引联合机及担任使饲畜业的费力操作机械化方面的安装和装配工作达半年的联合机驾驶员与机械人员。
    按照各职业学校学生的标准，以服装、鞋子及衬衣供给农业机械学校的学生。
    五、在苏联文化部的职业学校与工厂人员训练学校的基础上组织二百五十所职业学校和农业机械化训练学校，在一九五四—一九五七年至少要开设三百所新农业机械化学校，每一个学校要有二百四十到二百七十名学生，并建筑二百所校舍，三百一十五个实习建筑物，和六百栋宿舍供现有的农业机械化学校使用。
    指令苏联文化部会同苏联农业和农业储存部及苏联国营农场部，就指导这些农业机械化职业学校和训练学校的组织工作，向苏联部长会议提出建议。
    六、为了供给机器拖拉机站和国营农场以更多的拖拉机、农业机器和设备，在国民经济计划中规定从一九五四年到一九五七年五月一日这一时期内，供应农业至少五十万台一般用拖拉机（以每台十五匹马力计算），供应二十五万台耕作用拖拉机，并供应必要数量的农业机器、汽车、流动修理车、石油产品容器和其他装备。
    七、必须指出：在机器拖拉机站中，复杂的农业机器装备水平和它们的修理及保管的生产和技术基础极不相称。许多机器拖拉机站没有修理工场、停车间、敞棚及其他生产用的房屋和为工作人员服务的处所。
    鉴于加强机器拖拉机站的生产技术基础具有重大的意义，兹规定：每一个机器拖拉机站和专门技术站必须有一个符合要求的标准修理工场，至少有两个到三个保管拖拉机的停车间，两个到三个保管联合机的敞棚，必要数量的保管农业机器的棚舍和露天混凝土平台，一个加油站，一个汽车房，一个零件储藏室，一个办公室，一个供水站和一个最起码的排水系统。
    责成苏联农业和农业储存部及其地方机关、州和边疆区苏维埃执行委员会、各共和国部长会议：
    （甲）保证在一九五三年建成并使用国民经济计划规定的六百七十三个修理工场，一千一百三十个敞棚和棚舍，八万一千二百平方公尺的面积的房屋，并着手增建五百个新的修理工场；
    （乙）保证在一九五四年到一九五六年期间内为机器拖拉机站建成并使用四千二百个修理工场，八千四百个保管拖拉机的停车间，八千四百个保管联合机的敞棚，保管农业机器用的一万五千个棚舍和一万五千个露天混凝土平台，二千八百八十个加油站，三千六百个汽车房以及三千六百个零件储藏室；
    （丙）在一九五四—一九五六年内，建筑九个修理工厂和六个区际大修工厂，并在一九五四—一九五五年内，完成三十六个修理工厂和十五个区际大修工厂的建设工作并使之开工；
    （丁）在一九五四—一九五五年内，扩大并修建四十一个修理工厂和一百二十五个区际大修工厂。苏联农业和农业储存部的全部修理企业的经费，由苏联预算中支付。
    指令苏联木材和造纸工业部、苏联建筑材料工业部和冶金工业部优先运出分配给机器拖拉机站的建筑材料。
    八、为了给机器拖拉机站的工人、工程师、技术人员和其他职员创造必要的生活条件，必须：
    （甲）在一九五四—一九五六年内，建成并使用一万零八百间住房，三千个集体宿舍；
    （乙）为了保证机器拖拉机站私人住宅建筑的大规模发展，在一九五四—一九五六年内，每年拨出四亿五千万卢布的私人住宅建筑贷款并给机器拖拉机站的工人、工程师、技术人员和其他职员一万二千卢布以下的贷款，期限十年，三年后开始偿还；
    （丙）在国民经济计划中规定，为了帮助机器拖拉机站工人建筑私人住宅，拨给机器拖拉机站以若干预装配的双间和单间住房以及建筑材料；
    （丁）建议集体农庄在一九五四—一九五五年内，在田间建筑公共宿舍，保管机器和修整机器的棚舍、田间厨房和固定油库。
    九、拖拉机和农业机器用的零件的生产十分落后，这是不能容忍的，因为这种情形使得拖拉机和农业机器不能及时地、质量优良地修理好。机器制造工业部与运输和重型机器制造工业部对零件的生产，对不间断地、完整地保证农业得到零件，没有予以应有的重视。
    指令机器制造工业部与运输和重型机器制造工业部大大扩大拖拉机和农业机器零件的生产，改善其质量并降低其成本，以消灭零件不足的情形，并严格地按照规定的各种零件的标准保证供应农业以各种零件，同时照顾到保证给消费者和供销处一定数目的后备货品。
    认为必须在一九五四—一九五五年内，在每一个机器拖拉机站建立拖拉机和农业机器的零件和部件的替换基础，以供应拖拉机工作队的技术需要，并在各修理厂和区际大修工厂中建立零件和部件的替换基础，以便对拖拉机、汽车和发动机进行大修，修理的数目占这些机器总数的百分之十。
    十、机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场的电气化，对于进一步加强农业的物质技术基础是一个重要的因素。农业电气化的扩展，有赖于更好地利用现有的农村发电站的电力；把机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场与工业动力系统结合起来，并通过建设新的农村发电站、风力设备的办法，吸收各个建筑与工业的部、署来建设发电站和电力网。电力首先应当用之于机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场的生产上。
    十一、鉴于现行的机器拖拉机站实物工资的制度在目前的情况下不能鼓励先进集体农庄努力提高生产，必须从一九五四年起按照各地区不同的标准对机器拖拉机站在集体农庄中所做的每项工作支付实物工资，同时实行丰收奖金制度。
    十二、责成苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部特别注意更加有效地使用机器和拖拉机、改进照料机器的工作、提高机器和拖拉机的生产率，定期修订生产定额，以使农业劳动组织适应生产技术设备的增长，鼓励机器和拖拉机工作者提高劳动生产率。
    十三、指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联机器制造工业部修改现行的分配新机器定货的制度和试验新机器的制度，以便在生产中迅速推广新农业机器。
    （六）关于改进农业的领导
    一、苏共中央全体会议认为：要完成农业方面的新的、巨大的和复杂的任务，苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、各地方党、苏维埃和农业机关，必须坚决改进对集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导。
    为了顺利完成这些任务，必须提高乡村中政治和组织工作的水平，发挥共产党员、青年团员、所有集体农民以及机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员的创造积极性，动员社会主义农业的一切人力物力，提高我们干部对每个集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场和每个区的状况的责任感。
    二、苏共中央全体会议认为，现在集体农庄已成为大规模的、多部门的经济，而用现代化的机器配备起来的机器拖拉机站，已成为农业生产中的决定性的力量，在这种情况下用能够有效地领导他们的本部门和能保证完成当前农业任务的有能力的干部来进一步加强集体农庄和机器拖拉机站，这就具有很重要的意义了。
    指令各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、边疆区党委、州党委，在一九五三年从工业部门以及国民经济其他部门中挑选出一批机械工程师，分派到各机器拖拉机站和专门技术站担任站长、总工程师和修理工场主任，以便在每一个机器拖拉机站中一般都由具有高等教育程度的专家来担任这些职务。至于那些虽然没有受过专门教育、但实际上却很熟悉自己业务并善于领导机器拖拉机站的站长，则应该留任原职并帮助他们提高自己的业务水平。
    党组织应该对那些离开机器拖拉机站到工业企业、建筑工地和其他部门去工作的拖拉机手和其他机器操使者进行解释工作，号召他们回到机器拖拉机站来，因为如果现在当拖拉机手在机器拖拉机站工作能够获得高额的有保证的工资的话，那末许多以前的机器操使者就会乐于回到机器拖拉机站工作的。
    规定：对于由国民经济其他部门调派到机器拖拉机站工作的机械工程人员，以及从前曾在机器拖拉机站工作过、而现在愿意回机器拖拉机站的拖拉机手和其他机器操使者，各个有关的企业、机关、部、署应该毫不阻碍地放行。
    三、指令苏联文化部在一九五四—一九五五年内交给苏联农业和农业储存部六千五百名去机器拖拉机站工作的工程机械人员，其中包括一九五四年从各农业机械学院和其他高等技术学校中毕业的青年技术人员中拨出的二千五百名工程师。
    四、苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议指出，现行的每一个农业专家照顾几个集体农庄的农艺和动物饲养方面事务的制度，不能适应当前农业日益增加的任务。在这种情况下，农学家、动物饲养学家和其他农业专家往往不是集体农庄生产的组织者，而且不直接参加实行科学的耕作和动物饲养方法以及在集体农庄中采用科学成就和先进经验的工作。
    为了加强对集体农庄的农业和动物饲养技术的专门的援助，应改变以前按区域配备农学家和动物饲养学家的办法，在机器拖拉机站中建立经常为集体农庄工作的农学家和动物饲养学家，使每个集体农庄都有机器拖拉机站编制内的一两个农业专家经常为它服务。为了照顾一些较大的集体农庄，在机器拖拉机站的编制内，每一个工作队和每一个牲畜饲养部配备一个专家。
    指令苏联农业和农业储存部、各加盟共和国部长会议、边疆区执行委员会、州执行委员会在一九五四年春天以前，派十万名农学家和动物饲养学家到机器拖拉机站去为集体农庄服务，这项人力的来源是从各农业部及其地方机关改组后编余的、受过高等和中等教育的农学家和动物饲养学家，机器拖拉机站的分区农学家网、区农业和农业储存管理局中的分区动物饲养学家和农学家网取消后的人员，其他机关和组织中裁减出来的专家，以及从农业高等学校和技术学校毕业的青年专门人材。
    五、指令各州、边疆区和加盟共和国的党、苏维埃和农业机关消除对选拔和培养集体农庄领导干部的工作重视不够的情况，并保证选拔政治上和业务上经过考验的、受过高等和中等农业教育的专家以及其他熟悉农业的、在领导和组织工作方面有丰富经验的、有能力领导大集体农庄经济的专家，担任集体农庄主席以加强集体农庄主席的阵容。
    六、必须指出，农业机关方面一向领导机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的办法现在已不适合农业中日益增长的要求和已发生的变化。苏联农业和农业储存部及其地方机关往往脱离集体农庄和机器拖拉机站工作，在决定发展农业的许多重要问题时采取形式主义的办法，不分析某些重要部门无人过问状态的原因，也没有及时地给落后地区和落后集体农庄以必需的援助。
    为了改善农业的领导，为了尽可能多地调出大批在农业机关中工作的专家来加强集体农庄和机器拖拉机站的干部，必须改组苏联农业和农业储存部及地方农业机关的工作。为了达到这些目的，必须：
    （甲）大大裁减苏联农业和农业储存部的管理部门及其地方机关的人员，以便从机关抽调出专家到机器拖拉机站和集体农庄担任工作，保证改进农业机关在领导农业生产方面的有效的日常活动和组织活动；
    （乙）苏联农业和农业储存部应集中力量来计划发展农业主要部门和监督国家农业计划的执行；加强农业宣传和对农业科学机构的领导以及在生产中采用科学成就和先进经验；领导机器拖拉机站和领导进一步提高农业生产机械化程度的工作；以物资和技术设备供应农业并给农业拨款；领导农业产品的储存工作；选拔、分配和训练干部并监督遵守集体农场章程的情形；
    （丙）责成俄罗斯联邦农业和农业储存部领导俄罗斯联邦境内的一切农业部门、集体农庄和机器拖拉机站，以便克服目前的不正确的情况，即俄罗斯联邦部长会议和俄罗斯联邦农业和农业储存部实际上对俄罗斯联邦的主要农业部门的管理不负责任。
    七、苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议认为：农业宣传和在生产中运用科学成就和先进经验，还没有成为苏联农业和农业储存部和地方党、苏维埃、农业机关领导农业工作的不可或缺的部分。先进集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场和农业生产革新者的新的工作方式和方法在生产中推行得极其缓慢和不坚决，没有好好地用来提高农作物的收获量，提高饲畜业的产品生产率和提高机器拖拉机的生产率。
    指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、各加盟共和国党中央委员会、苏共各边疆区、州委员会、各共和国部长会议以及各边疆区、州苏维埃执行委员会：
    （甲）消灭对农业宣传和在生产中运用科学成就和先进经验这些工作重视不够的现象并保证使广泛推行先进经验这一工作成为领导农业工作的不可或缺的部分；
    （乙）切实改进三年制农艺和动物饲养训练班的工作，克服训练集体农民和国营农场工人工作中的形式主义，教育训练班学员养成采用先进工作方法的习惯，以保证改善集体农庄和国营农场的生产工作；
    （丙）有系统地组织农业专家、拖拉机工作队长、田间工作队长、田间工作人员、饲畜业工作人员的研究班，来研究管理大农庄的农业技术和动物饲养技术方面的新的进步工作方式和方法。
    八、指令苏联文化部、苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部以及地方党和苏维埃机关，改善介绍农业科学成就和先进办法等问题的通俗书籍、农业学校和训练班用的教科书和实用教材等的出版工作，同时组织出版介绍先进的集体农庄、国营农场、机器拖拉机站和农业生产革新者的成就的彩色宣传画和专门小册子。
    九、指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、苏联政治与科学知识普及协会改进在集体农庄、国营农场、机器拖拉机站中进行农业讲座宣传的工作，吸收科学家、专家和农业先进生产者来参加这一工作。
    十、指令苏联文化部：
    （甲）根据苏联农业和农业储存部以及苏联国营农场部的计划和定货摄制必要数量的、质量很高的、主要是彩色的教育影片和通俗农业科学影片；采取必要措施直接在集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场大量放映教育片和通俗科学影片；
    （乙）大大地改善用无线电宣传农业科学成就和先进经验的工作。
    十一、指令苏联农业和农业储存部、苏联国营农场部、苏联文化部组织农业先进生产者、科学家和专家的讲演录音，广泛地利用矿石扩音器，在集体农庄、国营农场、机器拖拉机站和农业及动物饲养学习小组内转播报告和座谈的录音。
    十二、为了广泛地宣传社会主义农业的成就，一九五四年在莫斯科开办经常开放的全联盟农业展览会；在男女集体农民和所有的农业工作人员中，在集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中、在各区、州、实验站、科学研究所内，展开争取参加全联盟农业展览会的权利的竞赛。同样，各区、州、边疆区和各共和国每年也要举办农业展览会。
    十三、苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议指出，农业科学虽然获得了一定的成绩，但还是落后于集体农庄和国营农场生产的要求。许多科学研究所和实验站脱离实际地进行工作，把自己局限在实验室和实验园地的狭窄圈子里，没有以新的发现和新的倡议来丰富科学和实践，对集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场在提高土地生产率和饲畜业方面很少帮助。
    指令苏联农业和农业储存部及各州、边疆区、共和国的党和苏维埃机关消灭科学研究机关工作中的缺点，克服科学落后于集体农庄和国营农场生产的要求的现象，提高科学机关对集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场作实际帮助的作用，帮助它们进一步提高农业各部门。动员科学家的力量来进一步发展农业科学，使农业科学以提高劳动生产率和增加农业生产的新知识和新方法武装农业工作干部。
    十四、指令苏联农业和农业储存部、地方党和苏维埃机关保证经常的监督使集体农庄章程得到最严格的遵守，不容许浪费公共土地和集体农庄财产，采取措施以消除集体农庄中经营不良的现象，设法改进劳动组织和提高劳动纪律，保证所有集体农民积极参加他们集体企业的工作。
    十五、目前，全国各地区已经有相当多的在经济上巩固的集体农庄，这些集体农庄获得大量的现金收入和实物收入，顺利地执行着国家交给的任务，每年保证集体农民的劳动日得到高额的产品报酬和现金报酬。实行党和政府制定的关于发展农业的一些重大措施，就可以保证集体农民的现金收入不断地大大增加。在这种情况下，随着集体农庄公有经济的增长，它们就完全可能用自己的一部分收入来建筑幼儿园、托儿所和产妇院，以为集体农庄女庄员创造优良的条件，使她们能参加集体农庄的生产和更加积极地参加公共生活。经济上巩固的集体农庄还有可能而且必须为建设俱乐部和其他文化教育机关拨出必要的资金。还应当建议集体农庄帮助集体农民修理和建筑住宅和宅旁建筑，帮助他们获得果树幼苗在自己的园地中栽种，供给他们燃料以及满足集体农民个人的其他需要。
    （七）党在乡村中的政治工作
    如果认为农业的进一步提高会自动地到来，那是错误的。如果不改进党组织的工作，为提高农业所创造的物质条件和可能性，是不能自行获得应有的效果的。为了利用这些可能性和条件，党组织应该领导广大的集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员，发动他们去为大力提高农业而斗争。因此，要胜利地解决进一步发展农业的任务，就要求党组织在群众中尽力加强组织工作和政治工作。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议指出，在乡村中的党组织的活动有着严重的缺点。许多集体农庄中的群众政治工作的水平很低，对劳动人民的政治教育没有给予应有的注意。在许多集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中文化和生活福利的服务很糟。区的党机关和苏维埃机关的工作内容和工作方法，常常不符合改进集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导的要求。虽然地方党机关和苏维埃机关工作人员数量很多，但没有确定各区领导工作人员对集体农庄和拖拉机站的事务应负的责任。对各集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导主要是通过这种方法，即在进行农业运动时派遣一些往往是不懂农业的专员到地方上去，这就降低了经济领导人员对他所担当的事务的责任心。各区党委会很不重视集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的党组织的工作，常常任其自流，在经济领导工作中不依靠它们，因此许多党组织对集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站工作没有起必要的作用，组织集体农庄的活动分子和机器拖拉机站、国营农场的工作人员的工作做得不好。在争取提高农业的斗争中，地方党机关对乡村中的青年团这样一支很大的力量估计不足，并没有充分利用它。青年团组织和乡村青年不大被吸收去帮助解决提高农业和公共饲畜业效率的任务。苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议认为，农业领导中的缺点和错误在很大的程度上是由于有许多的州党委会、边疆区党委会以及加盟共和国党中央委员会对各区的领导工作不能令人满意，它们对地方上的情况很不了解，对一些落后的区和集体农庄没有进行有效的帮助，放弃了对机器拖拉机站的领导，并把对机器拖拉机站工作所应负的一切责任推卸给区的组织。为改进乡村中党的组织工作和党的政治工作起见，苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议决定如下：
    一、指令各州委会、边疆区委会和加盟共和国党中央委员会大大加强对乡村中的群众政治工作的领导，保证向所有的集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工人解释本决议。展开广泛的社会主义竞赛，争取完成下面一些任务：进一步发展社会主义农业的各个部门；加强和全面发展集体农庄中的公共经济；增加总产量和商品产量；及时完成国家收购农产品的计划；提高集体农庄的货币收入和实物收入；改进集体农民的物质福利。党组织在一切工作中应该依靠集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中的先进人物以及农业和饲畜业中的能手，他们的队伍将一天天地成长和扩大起来。
    指令各中央和地方的报纸广泛地报道社会主义竞赛的进展情形、集体农庄建设的先进经验、党机关和苏维埃机关领导农业工作中的情况。
    二、指令各州委员会、边疆区委员会和加盟共和国党中央委员会改变对农业的领导方法，根除对集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场作一切表面的和官僚主义的领导，杜绝集体农庄的领导工作中的命令主义，加强与区和集体农庄的联系，好好地了解每一区的情况。
    必须坚决提高区执行委员会对完成党和政府的决定、以及各区农业工作情况的责任心，保证区执行委员会更加具体地领导集体农庄和国营农场的活动，特别是机器拖拉机站的活动，因为机器拖拉机站在发展农业中起着巨大的和日渐增长的作用。采取步骤来加强乡村中的区党委会和区执行委员会，办法是派遣熟习农业和有经验的干部到这些委员会去工作，这些干部应该善于正确和科学地领导集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场。由各州、边疆区和共和国机构中选拔一些优秀的工作人员去加强区内的党和苏维埃的领导工作。
    三、鉴于现有的乡村中的区党委会的组织机构不符合改进对机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的领导的要求，为了消灭无人过问集体农庄和机器拖拉机站的领导工作的现象或是不负责任的现象，在现阶段必须改建区内党机关的工作。区委会在每一机器拖拉机站中要设立受区党委书记领导的一组工作人员，这一组工作人员应该在机器拖拉机站以及该站所服务的集体农庄中进行党的政治工作。区委会的第一书记对这些组的活动进行总的领导。同时认为已不必要在机器拖拉机站中设立负责政治的副站长了。
    四、各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会及各边疆区、州、区的党委员会的最重要的任务之一，就是加强集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的党组织，提高它们在农业进一步高涨中的作用。保证把共产党员和共产主义青年团员分配到具有决定性的生产岗位上去；派遣经过培养的、有经验的党的工作人员来担负集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的党组织的书记工作。
    五、指令州党委会、区党委会、各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会和苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会提高各级青年团组织在争取进一步发展农业的斗争中的作用；保证吸收农村青年投入社会主义竞赛，用各种办法启发和支持青年的主动精神和有价值的创举。青年团组织应当成为社会主义竞赛的先锋，成为在生产中运用先进工作方法、农业科学和实践上的最新成就的先锋；应当发挥高度的主动精神，向党组织提出有关消灭集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场工作中的缺点的问题。
    六、由于妇女在集体农庄、国营农场的生产中具有巨大的作用，指令区、州、边疆区的党委员会和各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会，加强在集体农庄女庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的女工作人员中的群众政治、文化、教育工作；更广泛地吸引妇女参加集体农庄的建设工作，积极地为提高收获量和发展饲畜业而斗争。
    七、党组织必须估计到：随着社会主义农业的发展，集体农民和机器拖拉机站、国营农场工作人员的文化需求也在增长，因此要求加强对于农村居民文化和生活福利服务的关怀。必须提高乡村文化教育机关的工作水平，使俱乐部、图书馆的工作活跃起来，经常放映电影，增加农村的无线电设备，以及改进无线电广播工作的质量。党组织必须对农村的治疗和儿童福利机关的工作和贸易机关与合作社的活动，进行丝毫不懈的监督，保证一切生活必需品的不间断的贸易。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议认为，经常关心提高集体农庄劳动人民的物质文化水平，是各级党组织和苏维埃的最重要的责任。
    苏维埃国家满怀信心地向共产主义前进。共产主义建设纲领的重要的组成部分是：在社会主义工业——国民经济的主导力量——大大发展的基础上，实际地解决在我国生产丰足的农产品的任务。在现在的条件下，这个任务已成为我们全体人民的迫切任务。这一任务的胜利解决也将促进工人阶级和集体农民联盟的进一步巩固。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议号召全体集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员，为完成进一步发展苏联农业的任务贡献出自己的力量，发挥主动精神。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议坚信：在共产党的领导下，工人阶级、集体农民、我们的知识分子和全体苏维埃人民，一定会在最短的期间内完成这一任务。
