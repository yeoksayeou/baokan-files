    Head of the Soviet Sports Delegation
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are successfully completing the great task of building communism.

    In our country, the living standards and cultural level of the working people are constantly improving on the basis of a strong and rising national economy.

    In the Soviet state, all conditions have been created for the broad development of sports and athletics. Sports and athletics in the Soviet Union occupy an important place in the education system of the builders of a comprehensively developed communist society. In the Soviet Union, engaging in sports is for the purpose of enhancing health and improving labor capacity. Sports and athletics in the Soviet Union are an important means of preventing disease and prolonging the lives of the Soviet people.

    Sports and athletics in the Soviet Union are an integral part of socialist culture. Its smooth development and prosperity are guaranteed, and this guarantee relies on the Communist Party and the Soviet government's continuous concern for the physical and intellectual development of the Soviet people. This year, the Soviet government allocated over 20 billion rubles to national health and sports, which is a clear manifestation of this concern.

    Most of the funds allocated to sports are used for the physical education of children, primary school students, university students, and young workers, for organizing scientific research work in sports, for sports equipment, and for training educated sports teachers, instructors, and coaches.

    All sports work in the Soviet Union is built on democratic principles.

    Soviet people who love sports are united in sports associations. True democracy is the hallmark of these associations. Every member of the association, regardless of his or her position, gender, ethnicity, or race, can be elected to any leadership position in the sports association.

    In the Soviet Union, there are a total of twenty-five such sports associations, uniting millions of working people. The grassroots organization of these associations is the sports group that organizes various sports activities in enterprises, factories, collective farms, government offices, and schools.

    Any sports association possesses sports fields, sports equipment, and sports supplies, which are used free of charge by association members. In addition, most large factories and enterprises have built their own sports fields, stadiums, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and sports palaces.

    The Soviet people's love for sports is cultivated from childhood. The state has built many parks, sports fields, and children's stadiums for children. Before school age, children develop the habit of loving morning exercises, games, and simple competitions.

    Physical education is a compulsory subject in secondary schools.

    Sports and athletics occupy an even more important position among students in secondary technical schools and universities.

    The Soviet Trade Union gives great attention to the physical education and sports development of the working people.

    Millions of young people and adults are engaged in sports activities in more than twenty volunteer sports associations.

    Trade union volunteer sports associations have cultivated many outstanding Soviet athletes. Trade unions have many stadiums and a large number of technically skilled coaching staff. A significant portion of the trade union budget is used for mass sports and athletic activities for the working people.

    Sports and athletics have become a part of the life of Soviet collective farmers. The growing wealth of collective farms, the high degree of mechanization of field work, the prosperous life and cultural growth of collective farmers have promoted the development of sports activities. In recent years, new sports federations have been established in the Soviet republics—sports associations for collective farm athletes. This is the most mass-based sports association in the country. For example, the collective farm sports associations of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Ukraine, and Belarus have more than three million members. The ranks of collective farm athletes are constantly growing. Athletes in collective farm sports associations have their own sports fields. For example, the sports groups of the Ukrainian "Kolhospnyk" collective farm sports association have more than 11,000 sports fields, more than 2,000 gymnasiums, thousands of football fields, dozens of large stadiums, and swimming pools.

    The "Pakhtakor" sports association of Uzbekistan has more than 120 stadiums and 300 sports fields, etc.

    Competitions for rural athletes are mass-based. Millions of rural athletes participate in competitions in football, volleyball, basketball, track and field, gymnastics, skiing, cycling, weightlifting, chess, checkers, and other sports.

    The Communist Youth League is the soul of Soviet sports and athletics. Many interesting and important sports activities are initiated by the Communist Youth League.

    The Communist Youth League attracts a vast number of young people to engage in sports and participate in various mass sports activities. Many outstanding Soviet athletes are members of the Communist Youth League. The Communist Youth League conducts enormous political education work among athletes.

    The Soviet sports education system is built on a scientific basis. Specialized scientific research institutes study the physical education of the working people, study the problem of improving athletic skills, and study advanced methods of training athletes. The standards and requirements of the national "Ready for Labor and Defense" sports system are formulated on a strict scientific basis. This system is the foundation of the Soviet people's comprehensive physical development sports system, and it includes various sports and physical training methods. Millions of Soviet people have already met the prescribed standards.

    The "Ready for Labor and Defense" system aims at comprehensive physical development, training Soviet citizens to participate in labor and defend their socialist motherland.

    The unified all-Union sports classification table, formulated using scientific methods, stipulates a system for awarding sports grades and titles to athletes who have achieved higher results than the standards of the "Ready for Labor and Defense" system. It has powerfully promoted the improvement of Soviet athletes' skills.

    Medical examination is an inseparable part of Soviet sports. Every sportsman and athlete can enjoy this medical examination free of charge.

    Great attention is also paid to the work of training sports teachers, instructors, and coaches for primary and secondary schools, specialized schools, research institutes, sports groups, and youth and children's sports schools.

    There are forty-one sports colleges and fifteen higher sports schools in the country. Thirty-three normal colleges and sixty-nine normal schools in Russia have sports departments and sports subjects.

    Many sports colleges have correspondence departments. In these correspondence departments, thousands of Soviet citizens can receive higher sports education without leaving their jobs.

    The learning network of various sports training classes scattered throughout the country is training tens of thousands of amateur sports workers (sports group chairmen, amateur instructors, sports referees, sports organizers, etc.) for grassroots sports groups.

    The work of Soviet sports groups is built on the basis of extensively absorbing social activists to participate and on the basis of the initiative of people engaged in sports activities.

    The characteristic of Soviet sports and athletics is its mass character. In the Soviet Union, in addition to widely popular national forms of sports, sports enthusiasts are engaged in forty-six kinds of sports activities.

    The most popular sports in the Soviet Union are: gymnastics, track and field, football, basketball, volleyball, skiing, skating, swimming, wrestling, boxing, weightlifting, cycling, motorcycle and automobile sports, tennis, mountain climbing, travel, chess, etc.

    All sports events, including national sports, have been conducted in multiple competitions. Millions of athletes have participated in these competitions. The number of athletes participating in these competitions is increasing year by year. For example, in 1949, 8,000 teams participated in the Soviet football championship, and by 1952, the number of participating teams had increased to 17,000.

    The skills of Soviet athletes are improving year by year. The increase in the number of athletes is proof. For example, in 1952 alone, 1,064 athletes obtained the title of athlete.

    Soviet athletes have repeatedly set world records after the war and have won victories in some of the largest international competitions.

    In the last three years alone, Soviet athletes have set more than one hundred world records.

    Soviet athletes have won world championships in weightlifting, classical wrestling, men's and women's skating competitions, volleyball, and chess.

    At the 15th International Olympic Games held in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, in 1952, our athletes gave a wonderful performance. They won championships in gymnastics, wrestling, weightlifting, and shooting.

    Many Soviet athletes won gold, silver, and bronze medals. For example, meritorious athletes Viktori Chukarin and Maria Gorokhovskaya won the title of Olympic gymnastics all-around champion. Many Soviet athletes are champions and world record holders in several sports.

    There are many strong and powerful people in the Soviet land. The new generation of strongmen maintains the glory of the Russian strongmen Poddubny, Saikin, and Semyankin, who have won world championships more than once. Among the eight world champions in classical wrestling, five are Soviet wrestlers.

    Utoodov, Saksanov, and Vorobyov are world weightlifting champions and world record holders. Chimmishkyan, Romakin, and Duganov have set world records more than once.

    All world records for discus, javelin, and shot put are created by Soviet athletes Dumbadze, Smirnitskaya, and Zybina.

    Almost all skating world records are created by Soviet athletes. Khalida Shegoleva and Oleg Goncharenko are world skating champions.

    Mikhail Botvinnik and Lyudmila Rudenko are world chess champions.

    The Soviet state celebrates the All-Union Sports Day every year. In this traditional people's festival, mass sports events, athletic competitions, and youth recreational programs are held everywhere. On this day, all sports venues in our country hold mass sports activities as a review of the sports achievements of the previous year. On this day, according to the government's decision, Soviet athletes who have achieved outstanding sports results are awarded gold and silver medals, as well as the titles of athlete and meritorious athlete.

    There is no ethnic strife or racial discrimination in Soviet sports. It is based on fraternal cooperation and friendship among all nationalities. Soviet athletes are also strengthening friendly ties with foreign athletes.

    Soviet sports organizations participate in the International Olympic Committee and various international federations of major sports.

    Soviet athletes actively participate in all international competitions, which promote friendship among athletes from all countries.

    There is a solid and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Soviet athletes regard it as their sacred duty to further promote the great friendship between these two great nations.

    A fraternal friendship has been established between athletes of China and the Soviet Union. Soviet athletes have met Chinese athletes more than once. In 1951, the Soviet basketball team was warmly received in China. Soviet athletes have also repeatedly met Chinese athletes at the World Youth and Student Festivals. Soviet athletes also got to know Chinese athletes from their friendly competition performances held in Moscow.

    The athletes who are now participating in the Soviet sports delegation to Beijing have all participated in the World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival in Bucharest. Here, they met their friends again, including Wu Chuanyu, the swimming champion of the festival.

    Soviet athletes, together with the entire Soviet people, are delighted with the achievements made by the great Chinese people in improving the national economy and culture.

    We will make it our task to further consolidate the ties and friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples in the struggle for peace.

    Soviet athletes and sports workers are active fighters for peace. They constantly adhere to a policy of peace in their labor, social, and sports activities. At every international gathering, they strive to strengthen friendship and cultural cooperation among the peoples of all countries and promote the consolidation of the cause of peace.

    Meritorious Soviet athlete, three-time world speed skating champion, and member of the Soviet Peace Committee, Maria Isakova, expressed the thoughts and feelings of Soviet athletes very well. She said at the World Peace Congress: "Soviet athletes, together with the people of all countries, demand peace. We exercise our will and train our bodies for constructive labor and for the struggle for peace. We know very well that only peace can give us the opportunity to engage in any sport. We know that only in times of peace can our children, male and female athletes, concentrate on competitions."

    The slogan of the Soviet people and Soviet athletes is: "Give the world peace!"

    苏联人民在共产党的领导下顺利地完成着共产主义建设的伟大任务。
    在我国，劳动人民的生活和文化水平在国民经济强大高涨的基础上不断地提高着。
    在苏维埃国家里为体育和运动的广阔发展创造了一切条件。苏联的体育和运动，在全面发展的共产主义社会的建设者的教育制度中占有重要的地位。在苏联，从事体育运动，是为了增强健康和提高劳动能力。苏联的体育和运动是预防疾病和延长苏联人民寿命的重要手段。
    苏联的体育和运动是社会主义文化的一个组成部分。它的顺利发展和繁荣是有保证的，这种保证就是依靠共产党和苏联政府对苏联人民体力和智力发展的不断关怀。今年苏联政府把二百多亿卢布拨给国民保健事业和体育事业，就是这种关怀的显明表现。
    拨给体育用的经费，大多用在儿童、小学生、大学生、青年工人的体育教育方面，用在组织体育的科学研究工作方面，用在体育设备方面，用在培养有教养的体育教师、指导员、教练员等方面。
    苏联的一切体育工作都建筑在民主的原则上。
    喜欢运动的苏联人都团结在体育协会里。真正的民主就是这些协会的特点。协会的每个会员，不论他的职位、性别、民族、种族，都可能被选为体育协会的任何领导人员。
    在苏联总共有二十五个这样的体育协会，它团结了数百万的劳动人民。这个协会的基层组织就是在企业、工厂、集体农庄、机关和学校里组织各种运动的体育团体。
    任何一个体育协会都拥有运动场、体育设备、体育用品，这些设备为协会会员免费使用。此外，在绝大多数的大工厂和企业里都建设起了自己的运动场、体育场、游泳池、体操室、体育宫。
    苏联人民对体育的爱好从幼年时代就培养起来了。国家为儿童建造了许多公园、运动场和儿童体育场。儿童们在学龄以前就养成了爱好早操、游戏、简单的比赛的习惯。
    中等学校的体育功课是必修的。
    在中等技术学校和高等学校的学生中间，体育和运动占有更重要的地位。
    苏联职工会对劳动人民的体育教育和运动的发展给予莫大的关怀。
    在二十多个志愿体育协会里，有数百万青年和成年人在从事着体育运动。
    职工会志愿体育协会培养了不少的卓越的苏联运动员。职工会有很多的体育场，并有很多的技术熟练的教练干部。职工会预算的相当大的一部分用在劳动人民的群众性的体育和运动活动方面。
    体育和运动已成为苏联集体农民生活中的一部分。集体农庄的增长着的财富、田野工作的高度机械化、集体农民的富裕生活和文化的增长，促进了体育运动的开展。近年来，在苏联各共和国都建立了新的体育联合组织——集体农庄运动员们的体育协会。这在国内是一种最富有群众性的体育协会。例如，俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国、乌克兰、白俄罗斯的集体农庄体育协会就拥有三百多万会员。集体农民运动员的队伍在不断增长。集体农庄体育协会的运动员都有自己的运动场。例如，乌克兰“柯高斯普尼克”集体农庄体育协会的各体育团体拥有一万一千多个运动场、二千多个体操运动场、数千个足球场、数十个大运动场和游泳池。
    乌兹别克斯坦“巴赫达柯尔”体育协会的会员有一百二十多个体育场，三百个运动场等。
    农村运动员们的竞赛会，都是带有群众性质的。数百万农村运动员参加了足球、排球、篮球、田径、体操、滑雪、自行车、举重、象棋、跳棋和其他运动项目的竞赛会。
    青年团是苏联体育运动的灵魂。许多有兴趣的和重要的体育活动，都是青年团倡议的。
    青年团吸引广大青年群众从事体育运动，参加各种群众性的体育活动。苏联许多出色的运动员都是青年团员。青年团在运动员之间进行巨大的政治教育工作。
    苏联的体育教育制度是建筑在科学的基础上的。专门的科学研究院研究着劳动人民的体育教育问题，研究着提高运动技术的问题，研究着训练运动员的先进方法。在严格的科学基础上制定了全国性质的“准备劳动与卫国”的体育制度的标准和要求。这个制度是苏联人民身体全面发展的体育制度的基础，它包括着各种运动项目和身体训练的方法。数百万苏联人民都已经达到了规定的标准。
      “准备劳动与卫国”制，是以全面的身体发展为目的的，它训练苏联公民去参加劳动和保卫自己的社会主义祖国。
    用科学方法制定出来的统一的全苏运动等级分类表，规定了对那些获得了比“准备劳动与卫国”制的标准更高成绩的运动员授以运动等级和称号的制度。它有力地推动了苏联运动员的技术的提高。
    医疗检查是苏联体育不可分割的一部分。每一个体育家和运动员都可以无代价地享受这种医疗检查。
    为中小学校、专科学校、研究院、体育团体、少年和青年体育学校等培养体育教师、指导员、教练员的工作，也予以很大的注意。
    在国内有四十一个体育专科学校和十五个高等体育学校。在国内的三十三个师范学院和俄罗斯的六十九个师范学校里都设有体育系和体育科。
    在许多体育学院都有函授系。在这些函授系里，数以千计的苏联公民可以不脱离工作而受到高等体育教育。
    散布在全国各地的各种体育训练班学习网，为基层体育团体培养着数万个业余体育工作者（体育团体主席、业余指导员、运动裁判员、体育组织者等）。
    苏联的体育团体的工作建筑在广泛吸收社会积极分子参加的基础上，建筑在从事体育活动的人的主动精神的基础上。
    苏联体育运动的特点就是它的群众性。在苏联，除了广泛流行的民族形式的运动以外，体育家们还从事于四十六种体育活动。
    在苏联最普及的体育项目是：体操、田径、足球、篮球、排球、滑雪、滑冰、游泳、角力、拳击、举重、自行车、摩托车和汽车运动、网球、爬山、旅行、象棋等等。
    所有的体育项目，其中包括民族形式的体育项目，都进行了多次的竞赛。参加这些竞赛的已经有几百万运动员。这些参加竞赛的运动员一年一年地增加着。例如，一九四九年，有八千个球队参加了苏联足球锦标赛，到一九五二年参加比赛的球队已增为一万七千个。
    苏联运动员的技术在逐年提高。运动选手人数的增加便是证明。例如，仅在一九五二年便有一千零六十四个运动员获得了运动选手的称号。
    苏联的运动家在战后曾多次创造了世界纪录，并在一些最大的国际竞赛中赢得了胜利。
    仅在最近三年中，苏联运动员便创造了一百种以上的世界纪录。
    苏联运动员在举重、古典式角力、男女滑冰比赛、排球和象棋方面，都赢得了世界冠军。
    一九五二年在芬兰首都赫尔辛基举行的第十五届国际奥林匹克运动大会上，我们的运动员作了精彩的表演。他们在体操、角力、举重和射击比赛中取得了冠军。
    很多苏联运动员获得了金质、银质和铜质奖章。例如，功勋选手维克多里·朱卡林和玛丽亚·戈罗霍夫斯卡娅赢得了奥林匹克体操绝对冠军的称号。很多苏联运动员都是一身兼数项运动的冠军和世界纪录的保持者。
    在苏维埃土地上强壮有力的人是很多的。新的一代的力士们保持了曾经不止一次赢得世界冠军称号的俄罗斯力士波杜布内依、萨依金、谢米扬金的光荣。在古典角力的八位世界冠军中，有五位是苏联的角力选手。
    乌图多夫、萨克沙诺夫、伏罗比也夫是举重的世界冠军和世界纪录保持者。齐密施基扬、罗玛金和杜加诺夫等曾不止一次地创造了世界纪录。
    所有掷铁饼、掷标枪和推铅球的世界纪录都是由苏联选手杜穆巴节、斯密尔尼茨卡娅、泽宾娜创造的。
    几乎所有滑冰的世界纪录都是由苏联运动员创造的。哈里达·谢果列叶娃和奥列格·冈察连柯是滑冰的世界冠军。
    米哈依尔·波特文尼克和鲁德米拉·鲁金科是象棋的世界冠军。
    苏维埃国家每年都要庆祝全苏体育节。在这个已成为传统的人民节日，各地都举行群众性的体育大会，竞技比赛和青年的游艺节目。我国所有体育场在这一天都要举行群众性的体育活动，作为对上一年体育成就的检阅。在这一天，根据政府的决定，对创造卓越的体育成绩的苏联运动员授予金质和银质奖章以及运动选手和功勋选手的称号。
    在苏联体育运动中没有民族纠纷和种族歧视。它是建立在各民族兄弟般的合作和友谊的基础上的。苏联运动员并加强着和国外运动员的友谊联系。
    苏联的体育组织，参加了国际奥林匹克委员会和各种主要运动项目的国际联合会。
    苏联的运动员积极参加所有的国际竞赛，这些竞赛促进着世界各国运动员之间的友谊。
    中苏两国人民间存在着巩固的、牢不可破的友谊。苏联运动员把进一步促进这两大民族间的伟大友谊看作是自己的神圣职责。
    在中苏两国的运动员之间已建立了兄弟般的友谊关系。苏联运动员曾不止一次同中国运动员相会。一九五一年苏联篮球队在中国受到热烈接待。在世界青年与学生联欢节苏联运动员也屡次和中国的运动员相会。苏联运动员也从中国运动员在莫斯科举行的友谊比赛表演中认识了他们。
    现在参加苏联体育代表团来北京的运动员们都参加过布加勒斯特的世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节。他们在这里又遇到了自己的朋友们，其中包括联欢节的游泳冠军吴传玉。
    苏联运动员和全体苏联人民一道，都为伟大的中国人民在提高国家经济和文化方面所获得的成绩而欢欣。
    我们将把更加巩固苏中两国人民在争取和平斗争中的联系和友谊，作为自己的任务。
    苏联的运动员和体育工作者是争取和平的积极斗士。他们在自己的劳动的、社会的和体育的活动中不断地遵行着和平政策。他们在每一个国际的集会中，都力求加强各国人民间的友谊和文化合作，促进和平事业的巩固。
    苏联功勋选手、三次荣获速度滑冰世界冠军、苏联拥护和平委员会委员马丽亚·伊萨柯娃曾很好地表达出了苏联运动员的思想和感情。她在出席世界保卫和平大会时说道：“苏联的运动员同各国人民一道要求和平。我们为了建设性的劳动，为了争取和平的斗争而锻炼自己的意志和训练自己的身体。我们很清楚地知道，只有和平才能给我们以从事任何运动的机会。我们知道，只有在和平时期，我们的孩子们，男女运动员们，才能安心地进行比赛。”
    苏联人民和苏联体育家的口号就是：“给世界以和平！”
