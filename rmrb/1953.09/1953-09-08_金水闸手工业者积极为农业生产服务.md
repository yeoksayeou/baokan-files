    Jinshui Gate Handicraft Workers Actively Serve Agricultural Production
    By our reporters Xiao Yan and Gao Changren
    Jinshui Gate is a small market town in Jinkou Town, Wuchang County, Hubei Province. It has 793 households with a population of 2,937. There are 196 industrial and commercial businesses, including 68 handicraft businesses. Including family members participating in labor, there are 189 people engaged in handicrafts, 33 hired workers (21 fixed workers, 12 temporary workers), and 32 apprentices. These include eleven trades such as ironwork, woodwork, bamboo weaving, flour mills, tofu workshops, grinding mills, threshing mills, sugar mills, rope making, barber shops, and tailoring. Among them, the industries most closely related to rural areas are iron, wood, and bamboo weaving.
    Before liberation, Jinshui Gate had six woodworking workshops, three iron workshops, and seven bamboo weaving workshops. They mainly produced farmers' and fishermen's production tools and general daily necessities. Production was highly seasonal. In the spring, plows and harrows were sold, and woodworking and ironworking for agricultural tools had business to do. In summer and autumn, hoes and sickles were sold more, and ironworking flourished. Bamboo weaving was busiest in the autumn. Winter was generally a slow season, and those who could weave fishing gear relied on doing business in winter. Although income in peak months was better, it was difficult to make up for expenses in slow months. Everyone compared the slow months to "the gates of hell" or "famine ridge." When slow months came, some carried loads to the countryside to find odd jobs or sell their labor, while others simply closed their doors and dug lotus roots or caught fish in the lake to make a living through sideline occupations. They struggled until the peak season, then borrowed some capital to buy raw materials in small quantities for production.
    Due to limitations in capital and raw materials, handicraft workers were unable to accumulate large quantities of products to supply the peak season market, resulting in stockouts during peak seasons. And handicraft workers wanted to "make a killing" during the peak season, so they cut corners, produced shoddy goods, and greatly increased prices. Although farmers often suffered losses and were deceived, they had no choice but to buy because of urgent production needs. In slow months, handicraft products were difficult to sell. At this time, competitors often disregarded costs and competed to sell at low prices.
    After the liberation of Wuchang in 1949, due to the increase in farmers' purchasing power after the land reform in rural areas and the strong support of the people's government for handicrafts, such as actively organizing them to serve farmers, calling for improvement of business attitudes, opposing shoddy manufacturing, improving quality, and reducing costs, and at the same time adjusting the relationship between masters and apprentices and the relationship between employers and employees, all handicrafts in Jinshui Gate that were beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have been developed. Up to now, the number of woodworking businesses has increased from six to sixteen, bamboo weaving from seven to seventeen, ironworking from three to four, and tailoring from three to ten. The one household that made paper horses and other superstitious items has closed down.
    In March of this year, handicraft workers strengthened their ties with rural areas. First, they wrote letters to farmers in eight nearby townships through the Handicraft Industry Union, guaranteeing that the agricultural tools they made would be of good quality, durable, reasonably priced, and guaranteed for return and exchange. Zhang Jinghai, director of the Handicraft Industry Union, personally went to various townships to promote and represent Jinshui Gate handicraft workers to negotiate orders. At this time, the farmers were preparing for spring plowing and needed a large number of agricultural tools. At the same time, some townships had a batch of fruits of struggle and wanted to buy agricultural tools to distribute to the farmers, so a large number of orders were concluded. For example, Heping Township ordered 250 large agricultural implements (plows, harrows, cultivators, etc.) at one time, worth 12 million yuan. For this batch of products, handicraft workers adopted the method of voluntary association, joint purchase of raw materials, division of labor in manufacturing, and unified delivery. They also collectively signed contracts with rural areas through the Handicraft Industry Union, which specifically stipulated the materials, styles, quality, specifications, quantity, and delivery date of the products. Prices were calculated based on cost, and the selling price was lower than usual. After the contract was signed, the township government paid 80% of the order in advance, and the handicraft workers used this money to jointly purchase materials in Hankou. When distributing the manufacturing quantities, the opinions of those handicraft workers who had a reputation among farmers for specializing in agricultural tools were respected and taken care of, allowing them to report their own manufacturing quantities, and the rest were distributed according to labor and technical conditions. After the finished products were made, the name of the manufacturer was marked on them to guarantee responsibility for return and exchange. When inspecting the finished products, in order to fulfill the contract and establish credibility, the spirit of criticism and self-criticism was promoted. For example, Hu Daolong, a woodworking business, did not fulfill the contract and used bad wood, causing the plow handle to crack and not be of sufficient size. Strict criticism was made of this behavior, and a guarantee of return and exchange was provided. The farmers were very satisfied with this. Later, even farmers dozens of miles away came to Jinshui Gate to order agricultural tools.
    Since establishing close ties with rural areas and actively serving agricultural production, the number of handicraft workshops has increased, and the turnover of each handicraft workshop has also increased significantly. Taking woodworking as an example, the turnover from January to May of this year reached 150 million yuan, more than three times the turnover of the same period last year, and the slow month of this year has become a peak month. Handicraft workers are actively adding workers and apprentices to expand their business. Since this spring, Jinshui Gate handicrafts have added twelve new workers (eight in woodworking, ironworking, and bamboo weaving) and fourteen new apprentices (eleven in woodworking, ironworking, and bamboo weaving). Zhang Jinghai's family of five came to Jinshui Gate three years ago with six sheng of rice as capital. Now he has opened a small woodworking workshop, hired one worker, and brought four apprentices. Recently, he is also preparing to find a house to expand his business. Wang Shijin is a carpenter who makes wooden boats. In the slow months of 1948, he had to carry loads to the countryside to sell odd jobs, and he only sold one boat in the peak months. By 1952, he hired a worker. In addition to making a batch of agricultural tools, he also made six boats. This year, the demand is even greater. In the spring, he made a batch of agricultural tools, which have all been sold out. He has already sold six boats in the first half of the year alone. Wang Shijin said excitedly: Since he became a carpenter, he has never encountered such good business as now.
    Now, the handicraft workers in Jinshui Gate have high confidence in their business. Zhang Jinghai, a handicraft worker who has run to seven or eight townships to establish direct contact with rural areas, said: "When I ran to the countryside and learned that rural areas do have extremely high purchasing power, my confidence in business increased even more." The fact is indeed so. The sales of handicraft products in the rural market are very broad. We personally went to Fanhuh Township near Jinshui Gate to investigate the economic expenditures of several farmers' households. After the farmers harvest the grain every year, in addition to eating, which is the first expenditure, the second is to purchase means of production, make clothes, and add furniture. Hired and poor peasants who have been liberated are in particular need of acquiring agricultural tools after being allocated land. For example, poor peasant Yi Yuande, his family of seven, was allocated fifteen mu of land in 1951, and seven mu and five fen of land. At the same time, he was also allocated half a waterwheel (shared with others), one plow, and half a harrow and cultivator. In 1952, he harvested more than 7,000 jin of grain, more than 600 jin of sesame, and 300 jin of corn. This year, in addition to keeping about 5,000 jin of grain for his own consumption, the first thing he did was to buy agricultural tools. He bought two hoes and two sickles each, two-thirds of a new waterwheel, one carrying pole each for manure buckets and water buckets, two loads of bamboo baskets, and one each of enclosure walls and folding screens (both used for storing grain). Because he had no house to live in, he built three more houses. Because the income was mainly used for means of production, he did not bother to add clothes this year, and only spent nearly 200,000 yuan to make a mosquito net and a cotton quilt. With the autumn harvest in sight this year, Yi Yuande's first plan is to acquire all the rakes and brooms on the threshing floor. He estimates that it will cost four or five hundred jin of grain. He also plans to build a manure pit. With the remaining money, he plans to add some clothes for his children.
    It can be seen from this that further organizing handicrafts to serve farmers is an important issue at present.

    金水闸手工业者积极为农业生产服务
    本报记者  萧彦  高长任
    金水闸是湖北省武昌县金口镇的一个小集镇。共有七九三户，二九三七口人。工商业户一九六家。其中手工业有六十八户，连参加业务劳动的家属算在一块，从事手工业者一八九人，雇用工人三十三人（固定工二十一人，临时工十二人），学徒三十二人。包括铁业、木业、篾业（竹器）、粉坊、豆腐坊、磨房、碾坊、糖坊、线坊（打绳）、理发、成衣等十一种行业。其中和农村关系最密切的行业是铁、木、篾业。
    解放前，金水闸原有木业作坊六户、铁业三户、篾业七户，主要是制造农民和渔民的生产工具和一般日常生活用品。生产的季节性很大。春季销售犁、耙等，做农具的木业和铁业，便都有生意可做。夏秋季多销锄头、镰刀，铁业就好起来。篾业的旺月在秋季。冬季一般是淡月，会编制渔民生产用具的都靠冬季做生意。旺月的收入虽较好，但很难弥补淡月的开支。大家都把淡月比作“鬼门关”或“饥荒岭”，一到淡月，有的挑担子下乡找零活做、卖零工，有的索性关起门来，到湖里挖藕、捉鱼，靠搞副业度日。熬到旺月，再借点资金，零星买点原料进行生产。
    由于资金和原料的限制，手工业者无法积存大量产品，供应旺季市场，形成旺季脱销现象。而手工业者又想在旺季“捞一把”，便偷工减料、粗制滥造，并大大提高价格，农民虽然经常吃亏受骗，但因生产急需，又不能不买。到淡月，手工业产品滞销，这时同行间，往往不顾成本，竞相杀价出售。
    一九四九年武昌解放后，由于农村土地改革后农民购买力的提高和人民政府对手工业的大力扶植，如积极组织他们为农民服务、号召改进经营态度、反对粗制滥造、提高质量降低成本等等，同时调整了师徒关系和雇佣关系，因而金水闸凡是有利于国计民生的手工业，都得到了发展。到现在为止，木业由六户增加为十六户，篾业由七户增加为十七户，铁业由三户增加为四户，成衣业由三户增加到十户，做纸马等迷信品的一户已歇了业。
    今年三月，手工业者加强了和农村的联系。他们首先通过手工业联合会写信给附近八个乡的农民，保证做出的农具质量好，持久耐用、价钱公道、包调回换。手工业联合会主任张京海亲自到各乡宣传，并代表金水闸手工业者去接洽订货。这时农民正准备春耕生产，需要大量农具，同时有些乡有一批斗争果实，要买农具发给农民，于是大批订货成交。如和平乡一次订制大农具（犁、耙、耖等）二百五十件，价值一千二百万元。对待这批产品，手工业者采取了自愿联合、联购原料、分工制造、统一交货的办法。并通过手工业联合会集体和农村订立了合同，其中对产品的材料、式样、质量、规格、数目、交货日期等都有具体规定，按成本计算价格，售价较平常低。合同签订后，由乡政府预付百分之八十的订款，手工业者用此款到汉口联购材料。在分配制造数目时，尊重并照顾那些在农民中有信誉的专作农具的手工业者的意见，让其自报制造数目，其余的按劳动力及技术条件分配。制好成品后，都在上面标明制作者的姓名，保证负责回换。检查成品时，为了履行合同，树立信誉，发扬了批评与自我批评精神。如木业胡道龙不履行合同，使用坏木料，致使犁柄炸裂，且不够尺寸，对这种行为则进行了严格批评，并保证了回换。农民对这很满意。以后，连远在几十里地的农民也来金水闸订购农具了。
    自和农村取得密切联系，积极为农业生产服务后，手工业作坊户数增加，各手工业作坊的营业额也显著提高。拿木业来说，今年一月到五月的营业额达一亿五千万元，比去年同期的营业额增加三倍多，今年的淡月变成了旺月。手工业者积极增添工人、学徒，扩大营业。今春以来，金水闸手工业新增工人十二名（其中木、铁、篾业占八名），新收学徒十四名（木、铁、篾业占十一名）。木业张京海一家大小五口带了六升米的资金，三年前来到金水闸，现在已经开设了一个小木业作坊，雇请一个工人，自己还带了四个学徒，最近还准备找房子，扩大业务。王世进是做木划子的木匠。一九四八年淡月间，还得挑担子下乡卖零工，旺月也只卖出一只划子。到了一九五二年，他请了一个工人，除做了一批农具外，还做了六只划子。今年就更供不应求。春季做了一批农具，已都卖光，光是上半年就已卖出了六只划子。王世进兴奋地说：自从他当木匠以来，从来没有碰到过像现在这样好的生意。
    现在，金水闸手工业者的经营信心很高，曾跑过七、八个乡直接和农村建立联系的手工业者张京海说：“当我跑到乡下，了解了农村确有极大的购买力时，经营信心就越加增高了。”事实也确实如此，手工业产品在农村市场的销路是很宽广的。我们亲自到金水闸附近的范湖乡调查了几户农民经济开支的情况。农民每年打下粮食后，除了吃饭是第一项开支外，其次就是购置生产资料，做衣服、添家具。翻了身的雇贫农民，分到土地后，特别需要置办农具。如贫农易元德，他七口人，一九五一年分到十五亩田，七亩五分地同时也分到半乘水车（与人合用），一乘犁，耙、耖各半乘。一九五二年，他收了七千多斤谷，六百多斤芝麻，三百斤苞谷。这一年，他除了留下约五千斤谷供自己吃粮外，首先就是办农具。他买了锄头、镰刀各两把，新水车三分之二，粪桶、水桶各一担，箩筐两担，围墙、摺子（都是囤谷用的）各一个。因为没有房子住，他又盖了三间屋。因为收入主要用到生产资料上去了，这一年他没顾上添衣裳，只化了近二十万元做一顶蚊帐和一床棉被。今年秋收在望，易元德首先打算的还是要把打禾场上的杈子、扫帚等置全，他估计要四、五百斤谷，还准备修一个粪窖，余下钱来，才准备替孩子添点衣裳。
    由此可见，进一步组织手工业为农民服务，乃是目前的一项重要问题。
