    Central South Administrative Committee
    Issues Instructions on Forest Fire Prevention
    To strictly prevent fires and protect national forest resources, the Central South Administrative Committee recently issued instructions on forest fire prevention.
    The instructions stated: During the seasons when mountain fires are prone to occur (January, February, March, November, and December), to strengthen leadership in forest fire prevention work, forest fire prevention command headquarters should be established under the unified leadership of governments at all levels, composed of forestry departments, supervisory committees, public security organs, and local armed forces. These headquarters should formulate forest fire prevention work plans, conduct forest fire prevention campaigns with planning, supervision, and inspection, and combine this with patriotic education on forest fire prevention to mobilize and organize the masses to participate in the forest fire prevention movement, and educate the masses to prevent arson. When the masses must burn land for cultivation, they must report to the local township government in advance. Those burning land must clear firebreaks around the burning area, choose windless times, prepare fire-fighting tools, and proceed in a controlled manner. Those burning land must not leave the fire site until all embers are extinguished to prevent accidents. In the event of a forest fire, the local people's government should regard fighting and extinguishing the fire as the most urgent task, mobilizing the masses to put out the mountain fire. Those who first report a forest fire and those who actively contribute to fighting the fire should be commended or rewarded; those who are injured, killed, or suffer losses while fighting the fire should be given relief or compensation. If a local people's government fails to seriously lead the fire fighting effort when a forest fire occurs, resulting in serious losses, they shall be punished.
    The instructions pointed out: For mountains and forests that have not yet been distributed, the local government should, in conjunction with relevant departments, continue to implement the policy of mountain and forest distribution; for mountain and forest disputes, timely inspections and serious handling should be carried out to determine forest rights and protect the property rights of forest farmers from any infringement. Timber purchasing agencies should conduct reasonable logging, effectively control reasonable mountain prices for timber purchases, and guide the masses in mountainous areas to engage in forest sideline production to enhance the enthusiasm of the masses for forest fire prevention.

    为严防火灾，保护国家森林资源，中南行政委员会最近发布了护林防火指示。
    指示说：在山火易生季节（一、二、三月及十一、十二月）为加强护林防火工作的领导，在各级人民政府统一领导下，由林业部门、监察委员会、公安机关及地方武装部队组成护林防火指挥部，拟定护林防火工作计划；有布置、有督促、有检查地开展护林防火运动，并结合进行护林防火的爱国主义教育，发动和组织群众参加护林防火运动，教育群众防止放火烧山。群众必须烧垦时，事前要向当地乡政府报告，烧垦人要在烧垦地周围开辟防火线，选定无风时间并准备好打火工具，有控制地进行。烧垦人必须等全部火种熄灭后才离开火场，以免发生意外。遇有林火发生时，当地人民政府要以打火、灭火为最紧急的任务，发动群众，扑灭山火。对首先报告发生林火及打火积极有功者，予以表扬或奖励；因打火遭受伤亡或损失者，要予以救济或补偿。对遇有林火发生，当地人民政府不认真领导打火而造成严重损失者，予以处分。
    指示指出：山林尚未分配者，当地政府应会同有关部门，继续贯彻山林分配政策；对于山林纠纷，及时进行检查和认真处理，以确定林权，保护林农的所有权不受任何侵犯。木材采购机关要进行合理采伐，切实掌握合理山价收购木材，指导山区群众进行森林副业生产，以提高群众护林防火的积极性。
