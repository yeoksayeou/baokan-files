Xinhua News Agency, September 20th:

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army Public Security Forces All-Army Literary and Sports Reviewing Assembly grandly opened in Beijing on the 20th.

    Participating in the assembly were 1,407 athletes, amateur performers, and professional literary workers from the major military regions of the People's Liberation Army Public Security Forces. Eighty-one athletes, amateur performers, and professional literary workers from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Public Security Forces were also invited to participate in the assembly.

    At the opening ceremony, Li Tianhuan, Deputy Political Commissar of the Public Security Forces, delivered the opening speech. Li Tianhuan pointed out that the Public Security Forces guard the country's borders and internal security, and in many places, transportation is inconvenient, and the troops are dispersed. Therefore, carrying out combative, mass-based, and diversified literary and sports activities that are adapted to the characteristics of the Public Security Forces is of particular importance. He said: This assembly will review the situation of the Public Security Forces in implementing the policy of combative and mass-based literary work over the past year, exchange experiences, and learn from each other to further carry out literary and sports activities in the Public Security Forces.

    Luo Ruiqing, Commander and concurrently Political Commissar of the Public Security Forces, said at the meeting: The literary and sports activities of the Public Security Forces should be more in line with the actual situation of the troops, so that they can play a greater role in ensuring the completion of the troops' regular training and strengthening border defense and consolidating internal security tasks.

    Chen Yi, Minister of the Cultural Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission, Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government's Sports Commission, and Ma John, Vice Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation, were invited to attend the opening ceremony. Chen Yi and Rong Gaotang both spoke at the assembly.

    The Public Security Forces All-Army Literary and Sports Reviewing Assembly will last for ten days and will include general sports and various military sports competitions, as well as a variety of literary program performances.

    The professional literary workers of the Public Security Forces of the major military regions participating in the assembly, after the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission stipulated the policy of comprehensively carrying out combative and mass-based literary work in the troops, have all gone deep into the frontier, coastal defense, forests, grasslands, and railway lines to perform for the soldiers. For example, the literary workers of the Public Security Forces of the Southwest Military Region formed four groups in March this year and went to the long Yunnan border line to perform for the soldiers, and also held short-term literary backbone training classes in more concentrated troops to help the troops carry out literary activities. The literary workers of the Volunteer Army Public Security Forces went deep into the transportation lines that were frequently bombed by enemy aircraft in February this year to perform, carrying luggage and musical instruments, marching every day, and performing for the air defense sentries. In addition to performing, the literary workers participating in the assembly also conducted in-depth interviews and created works. Most of the programs they perform at the reviewing assembly are created in conjunction with the various tasks of the Public Security Forces. The two hundred and thirty-three amateur performers participating in the assembly are all representatives who have emerged in the Public Security Forces in carrying out combative and mass-based literary activities. Most of them are soldiers, and some are cadres. The programs they perform are all self-written and self-directed, and more profoundly reflect the rich life of the troops.

    The Public Security Forces have carried out sports activities in various situations. The soldiers stationed on the border have built ball fields on the grasslands and erected horizontal bars and parallel bars on the mountain tops and in the forests. They used all conditions to carry out various sports activities.

    解放军公安部队文艺体育检阅大会开幕
    【新华社二十日讯】中国人民解放军公安部队全军文艺体育检阅大会于二十日在北京隆重开幕。
    参加大会的有人民解放军公安部队各大军区的运动员、业余演员和专业文艺工作者共一千四百零七人。中国人民志愿军公安部队的运动员、业余演员和专业文艺工作者八十一人也应邀参加了大会。
    在大会开幕典礼上由公安部队副政治委员李天焕致开幕词。李天焕指出，公安部队守卫着祖国的边防和内防，许多地方交通不便、部队分散，因此开展战斗性、群众性、多样性的适应公安部队特点的文艺体育活动，就具有特别重要的意义。他说：这次大会将检阅公安部队一年来执行战斗性、群众性文艺工作方针的情况，并交流经验，互相学习，以进一步开展公安部队的文艺体育活动。
    公安部队司令员兼政治委员罗瑞卿在会上讲话说：公安部队的文艺体育活动应更切合部队实际，使其能在保证完成部队的正规训练和加强边防、巩固内防的任务中，发挥更大的作用。
    应邀参加大会开幕典礼的有中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部文化部部长陈沂、中央人民政府体育运动委员会秘书长荣高棠和中华全国体育总会副主席马约翰。陈沂和荣高棠都在大会上讲了话。
    公安部队全军文艺体育检阅大会共举行十天，有一般体育和各种军事体育比赛，同时并举行各种文艺节目的会演。
    参加大会的各大军区公安部队的专业文艺工作者，在中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部规定了全面开展部队战斗性群众性的文艺工作方针后，都深入边疆、海防、森林、草原和铁道线，为战士演出。如西南军区公安部队的文艺工作者在今年三月组成了四个小组，分别到云南绵长的边疆线上为战士演出，并在较集中的部队中举办了短期的文艺骨干训练班，帮助部队展开文艺活动。志愿军公安部队的文艺工作者在今年二月间深入到经常遭受敌机轰炸的运输线上进行演出，他们背着行李和乐器，每天一面行军，一面为防空哨兵演出。参加大会的文艺工作者在深入部队中，除演出外，还深入采访，进行创作。他们在检阅大会上演出的节目，大部分是结合公安部队各项任务创作的。参加大会的二百三十三个业余演员都是公安部队在展开战斗性、群众性的文艺活动中所涌现出来的代表人物，他们中大部是战士，也有干部。他们演出的节目都是自编自演，较为深刻地反映了部队的丰富生活。
    公安部队在各种情况下开展了体育运动。驻在边疆的战士们，在草原上修起球场，在山头上和森林里搭起单杠和双杠。他们利用一切条件进行了各种体育活动。
