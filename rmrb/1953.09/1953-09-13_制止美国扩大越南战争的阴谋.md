    Preventing the US Conspiracy to Expand the Vietnam War
    Cui Qi
    On September 2nd, US extremist Dulles, in his arrogant speech on the Korean issue, openly and blatantly announced the US conspiracy to intensify interference in and expand the Vietnam War. Dulles, with the deceptive tone habitually used by aggressors, said that the French war of aggression against Vietnam "is related to our (referring to the US aggressor group) vital interests in the Western Pacific," and therefore "it is worthwhile for the United States to increase aid." He openly threatened that the "consequences" of the US intensifying its interference in the Vietnam War "may not be limited to Indochina."
    Dulles certainly knows that he cannot scare the Chinese people, the Vietnamese people, and the Asian people; but it is well known that US adventurers are attempting new military adventures in the Far East and Southeast Asia.
    After the Korean War ceased, the reactionary forces in the United States, who had bet on the war, were doing their best to implement a policy of preventing the easing of international tensions and making them increasingly serious. They had to "disengage" in Korea, but they attached even greater importance to the Vietnam War.
    Recently, the US Congress passed an appropriation of $400 million to France to accelerate the Vietnam War. According to Agence France-Presse, the United States and France are also holding negotiations in Washington, and the United States is prepared to provide France with another $300 to $400 million in aid. French government officials said that the main purpose of this "additional fund" is to "intensify the training and arming of Indochina local forces." American columnist Allen revealed that the US government plans to provide $1 billion in aid to the French aggressors in Vietnam in this fiscal year.
    As a result, the United States is rushing a large amount of military supplies to the French aggressors in Vietnam. According to the United Press, the US "Department of Defense and the State Department fully realize that since the only large-scale war currently being waged is in Indochina, Indochina must be given priority in obtaining military supplies." French officials admit that the amount of war materials shipped to Vietnam by the United States each month has recently exceeded 20,000 tons, almost double the average in 1952. These circumstances show that the United States, which for years has borne 40 percent of the French war expenses in Vietnam, is investing an even greater war stake in the flames of Vietnam.
    Needless to say, these US aids to France have also become a political tool for the United States to control France. Dulles is increasingly urging France to expand its invading forces in Vietnam, expand the scale of the war, and force France to hand over more of its military command in Vietnam to the United States. According to Dulles's request, France put forward the so-called Navarre Plan. This plan stipulates that the French government will send 20,000 more soldiers to Vietnam in order to concentrate its forces and launch military offensives. Navarre, the commander-in-chief of the French invading forces in Vietnam, is also preparing to use "the method of conscripting Indochinese people" and "modeling after the South Korean army" to train 54 battalions this year and another 54 battalions of local troops next year to supplement the French invading forces in Vietnam. This military plan of the French Laniel government was of course immediately supported by Dulles. "The Washington Post" even undisguisedly encouraged Laniel to take risks, writing: "It must be admitted that he has extraordinary political courage. Laniel currently has the legal authority to send reinforcements to Indochina." As a result, certain groups in France are even preparing to mobilize troops from France, North Africa, and South Korea. Agence France-Presse revealed on September 9 that "the French battalion serving in the United Nations forces in Korea is about to withdraw, and some of these troops will be sent to Indochina." These "troops will serve as the backbone of the newly formed Franco-Vietnamese joint force."
    This made Dulles even more rampant. The United States even openly demanded that France conduct a "decisive" battle in Vietnam. A United Press dispatch on August 20 stated: "The US Embassy in Paris has made it clear that the next battle must be decisive, and therefore, France and the United States must do everything possible to make it decisive."
    The conspiracies of the American adventurers are not limited to this. He also wants to hold more American vassal states hostage, follow behind the United States, and be dragged into the water. Even at the meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France, Dulles exerted pressure on Britain and France, and even used the upside-down language of so-called "the result of the Korean armistice must not endanger the restoration and guarantee of peace in any other part of Asia" to force them to support the US gambling in the Vietnam War. After the Korean armistice, Dulles again gathered the other fifteen countries that sent troops to invade Korea and the United States to issue a joint "declaration," which also mentioned in the same way that the Korean "armistice must not hinder the restoration and maintenance of peace in any other region of Asia." Recently, according to the United Press, Dulles also "explained in detail" the US attempt to expand the Vietnam War at the US-Australia-New Zealand Council, because he wanted to "understand whether Australia and New Zealand would support such a plan of the United States."
    However, who doesn't know that the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people for national independence and freedom has severely struck the French colonial army aided by the United States and made itself increasingly strong. They are fully capable and prepared to continue to defeat the new war plans of the US and French reactionaries. Dulles's speech on September 2nd was strongly opposed by French public opinion and caused panic among many figures in the French bourgeoisie, which is completely understandable. The "Paris dispatch" of the "New York Times" on September 3rd admitted: "At present, US aid has frightened many French people, and their reason for fear is that US aid may trap the French indefinitely in a war they want to end." As early as August 19, the "Paris Communication" of the American "Washington Post" also wrote: "The obvious fact is that the Laniel-Navarre plan (i.e., the plan for the war of aggression against Vietnam) is directly in conflict with the rising tide of sentiment in France, which requires France to withdraw from the Indochina War on the basis of almost any face-saving plan that can be imagined. It is useless to deny that this tide does not exist."
    Dulles himself could not help but show that he was very cowardly. He extremely hypocritically concealed himself, saying: "We also hope to achieve peace in Indochina." This is obviously a worthless lie. The fact is that Dulles openly declared that he would withdraw from the political conference with Syngman Rhee in ninety days and destroy the Korean armistice, saying that "when conducting negotiations, we must always remember an end point"; at the same time, the United States is carrying out a large-scale conspiracy to interfere in and expand the Vietnam War.
    The villains of Dulles and his ilk cannot intimidate anyone, nor can they deceive anyone. In his "Letter to the Armed Forces and People of the Whole Country" issued on Vietnam's National Day this year, President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out: "On the one hand, the French colonialists and the American interventionists and their puppets hypocritically released 'peace' rhetoric and used so-called 'independence' and 'reform' to deceive them in an attempt to reduce the Vietnamese people's firm anti-enemy emotions. On the other hand, they urgently concentrate and increase troops and weapons in order to expand the war of aggression. Therefore, our military and civilians should always strengthen their vigilance and be ready to crush their conspiracies."
    The just struggle of the Vietnamese people to defend peace and strive for independence will surely receive the full support of peace-loving people all over the world and achieve greater victories. The will of hundreds of millions of people who demand peace has become a powerful and effective force; it has forced the American aggressors to cease fire in Korea, and it can also force the imperialists to lay down their arms in Vietnam.

    制止美国扩大越南战争的阴谋
    崔奇
    九月二日，美国极端冒险分子杜勒斯在他关于朝鲜问题的狂妄演说中，公然露骨地宣布了美国加紧干涉和扩大越南战争的阴谋。杜勒斯以侵略者惯于使用的欺骗口吻说，法国侵略越南的战争“关系到我们（指美国侵略集团）在西太平洋的切身利益”，因此“值得美国增加援助”。他公然恫吓说，美国加紧干涉越南战争的“后果，可能不以印度支那的范围为限”。
    杜勒斯当然知道，他是绝对吓不倒中国人民、越南人民和亚洲人民的；但美国冒险分子正在企图在远东和东南亚进行新的军事冒险，则是众所周知的。
    朝鲜战争停止以后，美国以战争为赌注的反动势力竭力执行着阻止国际紧张局势缓和、并使之越来越严重的方针。它们不得不在朝鲜“脱身”，却又对越南战争看得更加重要了。
    最近，美国国会通过了四亿美元的拨款给法国，以加速进行越南战争。据法新社称，美法还在华盛顿进行谈判，美国准备再给法国三亿到四亿美元的援助。法国政府官员说，这一笔“额外款项”的主要目的是要用来“加紧进行印度支那地方部队的训练及武装工作”。美国专栏作家艾伦并透露，美国政府计划在本会计年度中以十亿美元援助侵越法军。
    于是，美国正在赶运大量军火供给侵越法军。合众社透露，美国“国防部和国务院完全认识到，由于现在正在进行的唯一大规模战争是在印度支那，因此，必须使印度支那优先得到军火”。法国官方承认，近来美国每月运到越南的战争物资在两万吨以上，平均比一九五二年几乎增加一倍。这些情况说明，数年以来一直担负法国侵越军费百分之四十的美国，正以更大的战争赌注投入越南的战火里了。
    不消说，美国对法国的这些援助，同时就成为美国借以控制法国的政治工具了。杜勒斯日益加紧督促法国扩充侵越法军，扩大战争规模，并逼迫法国把它在越南的军事指挥权更多地交给美国。按照杜勒斯的要求，法国提出了所谓纳瓦尔计划。这个计划规定，法国政府将增派两万士兵到越南，以集中兵力发动军事进攻。法国侵越军总司令纳瓦尔并准备用“征调印度支那人的办法”，“以南朝鲜军为模范”，今年训练五十四营，明年再训练五十四营地方部队，以补充侵越法军。法国拉尼埃政府的这个军事计划，当然立即得到了杜勒斯的支持。“华盛顿邮报”更毫不掩饰地怂恿拉尼埃进行冒险，它写道：“必须承认他在政治上的非凡勇气，拉尼埃在目前有合法权力可以增派援兵到印度支那去”。于是，法国某些集团竟准备从法国、北非和南朝鲜调动军队了。法新社九月九日透露，“在朝鲜的联合国军中服役的法国营行将撤退，其中有一部分部队将被派往印度支那”，这些“部队将在新成立的法越联队中充当骨干”。
    这样就使杜勒斯更加嚣张起来了。美国甚至公开要求法国在越南进行“决定性”战役。合众社八月二十日电讯说：“美国驻巴黎大使馆已经说清楚，下一个战役必须是决定性的，因此，法国和美国必须尽一切能力使它能成为决定性的。”
    美国冒险家们的阴谋诡计还不仅如此。他还要挟持更多的美国附庸国家，跟在美国后边，被拖下水去。还在美英法三国外长会议上，杜勒斯就对英法施行压力，竟以所谓“朝鲜停战的结果绝对不得危及亚洲任何其他地方和平的恢复与保障”的颠倒黑白之词，强使它们支持美国在越南战争中的赌博。朝鲜停战后，杜勒斯又纠集出兵侵朝的其他十五个国家和美国一起发表了共同“宣言”，也如出一辙地提到朝鲜“停战决不能妨害亚洲任何其他地区和平的恢复和维护。”最近，据合众社称，杜勒斯还在美澳新理事会上“详细解释了”美国企图扩大越南战争的阴谋，因为他想“了解澳大利亚和新西兰是否将支持美国这样一种计划”。
    然而，谁不知道，越南人民为争取民族独立自由而进行的英勇斗争，已经给了美国援助下的法国殖民军以严重打击，并使自己日益壮大起来。他们是完全有力量有准备继续打败美法反动派新的战争计划的。杜勒斯九月二日的演说遭到法国舆论的强烈反对，并引起法国资产阶级许多人士的惊慌，是完全可以理解的。九月三日“纽约时报”的“巴黎专电”承认：“在目前，美援使许多法国人感到恐惧了，他们害怕的理由是，美援可能会把法国人无限制地陷在一个他们想要加以结束的战争里”。早在八月十九日美国“华盛顿邮报”的“巴黎通讯”，也写道：“明显的事实是，拉尼埃—纳瓦尔计划
  （即侵越战争计划）与法国国内日益增涨的情绪的浪潮是正面相抵触的，这种浪潮要求法国以几乎是可以想像得出的、任何保留面子的计划为基础，退出印度支那战争。讳言这种浪潮并不存在，是没有用处的。”
    杜勒斯自己也不能不表现出他是十分卑怯的。他极端虚伪地掩饰说：“我们也希望在印度支那获得和平”。这显然是一句一文不值的谎言。事实是，杜勒斯公开声言要和李承晚一起在九十天后退出政治会议，破坏朝鲜停战，说什么“进行谈判的时候，我们必须经常记住一个终点”；同时，美国正在大规模地进行干涉和扩大越南战争的阴谋计划。
    杜勒斯之流的恶棍们恫吓不了谁，也欺骗不了谁。越南民主共和国胡志明主席在今年越南国庆日发表的“告全国军民书”中曾指出：“法国殖民者和美国干涉者及其傀儡们，一方面假惺惺地放出‘和平’论调，并以所谓‘独立’及‘改革’来进行欺骗，企图降低越南人民坚决的抗敌情绪。另一方面它们又紧急地集中和增加军队与武器，以便扩大侵略战争。因此，我国军民应该时刻加强警惕，随时准备粉碎它们的阴谋诡计。”
    越南人民为保卫和平、争取独立的正义斗争，一定可以得到世界爱好和平人民的全力支持，取得更大的胜利。千百万人要求和平的意志，已经变成了强大和有效的力量；它已迫使美国侵略者在朝鲜停战，它也能够迫使帝国主义在越南放下武器。
