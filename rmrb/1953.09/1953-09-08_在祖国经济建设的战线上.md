    On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland
    Successful Trial of New Method for Extracting Borax
    The brine in Zigong, Sichuan, contains not only salt but also rich raw materials for manufacturing borax and valuable by-products such as potassium chloride. Borax is a raw material for enamel, glass, and pharmaceutical industries; potassium chloride is a raw material for explosives and matches. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, these important industrial raw materials were wasted in large quantities during the salt production process. In order to carry out the basic construction of the new Zigong Borax Factory and research new production procedures to increase borax production, the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central Government assigned the Industrial Raw Materials Group of the Chongqing Industrial Experiment Institute to Zigong City to organize research and experimentation with the technical personnel of the Zigong Salt Affairs Administration and the Preparatory Office of the new factory. Over the past five months, through investigation and understanding of the current factory production procedures and several new extraction methods, the cryogenic method was found to be the most suitable for large-scale production and has been successfully tested. The old method of borax extraction involved complicated production procedures, resulting in the dispersion and loss of raw materials and a very low production recovery rate. The new cryogenic method first concentrates the mother liquor from salt production, causing the raw materials for manufacturing borax and potassium chloride to precipitate out in solid form together. Then, water and soda ash are added for boiling to create a mixed solution of borax and potassium chloride. Finally, cryogenic treatment is used to separate borax and potassium chloride. This simplifies the production procedure, centrally recovers borax and potassium chloride, and increases the output of borax and potassium chloride. The new Zigong Borax Factory will use the cryogenic method for production, which is expected to increase borax production by 8.74 times compared to the old method, and potassium chloride production will increase by 2.13 times. It is estimated that this will create 26.3 billion yuan of wealth for the country annually.

    Shen Wanxiang's Bricklaying Team Continuously Sets New Records
    Since the launch of the patriotic production competition "Full of Red," Shen Wanxiang's bricklaying team (fixed group of six people) of the 802 Construction Site of the Third Work Area of the Shanxi Provincial Engineering Company has repeatedly set new records in bricklaying, based on ensuring quality and safe production. The first time, they set a record of laying 12,040 bricks per day; the second time, they reached 16,717 bricks; the third time, they reached 21,960 bricks. On August 16th, they set a new record of laying 30,851 bricks per day during the bricklaying of a certain project. Therefore, Shen Wanxiang attended the Shanxi Provincial Model Worker Congress.
    The reason why Shen Wanxiang's team can continuously set new records is mainly because they have plans and preparations for their work, and they vigorously promote advanced experiences. Their team often transports bricks to the construction site according to the plan the day before the operation. Some construction sites are far from water sources, making it inconvenient to use water. They dig small ditches around the construction site in advance, which makes the work convenient and saves effort. Because they have mastered the three major essentials of stability, accuracy, and speed, the division of labor among technicians, strong workers, and apprentices in the team is very clear. For example, when laying bricks, technicians lay the bricks, apprentices spread the mortar, and strong workers deliver the bricks, which is not chaotic and can ensure quality and improve efficiency. Comrade Shen Wanxiang is an alternate member of the Communist Party of China. Under the leadership of the Party branch, he unites all the workers in the team and often studies and improves work methods. They hold a technical research meeting once a week and invite technicians to explain various advanced experiences. Now, their team generally uses advanced experiences such as the "double-handed bricklaying squeezing mortar method," the "water-first mortar-later grouting method," and the "ladder-type hanging line wooden rake mortar spreading method," which plays a decisive role in ensuring quality and improving efficiency. To ensure the smooth progress of the work, their team has established a strict shift handover system and inspection system. At the same time, the team's life is also very healthy. They hold a life review meeting every Thursday to carry out criticism and self-criticism and improve their work.

    Successful Trial Planting of Rice in Miscellaneous Grain Producing Areas North of the Huai River
    This year, 55 mu of rice have grown for the first time in miscellaneous grain producing areas north of the Huai River in Anhui Province. These rice plants were trial-planted by the Huai River Management Committee at the rice cultivation experiment site established in Xujiagang, north of Bengbu. The rice is growing well, with golden ears of rice drooping heavily. Some early rice has already been harvested, and middle rice will be harvested soon; the average yield is about 700 jin per mu, and the highest can reach 1,000 jin. The color of the rice is the same as that on both sides of the Yangtze River.
    In the Suxian and Fuyang special districts north of the Huai River in Anhui Province, many places have low terrain, poor drainage, and are often subject to waterlogging and floods. In the past, these areas sowed miscellaneous grains such as sorghum and mung beans every spring and wheat every autumn, and never planted rice. Farmers believed that this was "leaky soil" and that rice would never grow there. Over the past two years, in addition to carrying out many flood drainage projects, the Huai River Management Committee has also begun to experiment with changing the planting of dryland crops to the planting of water-tolerant crops in these areas. This can not only make the crops adapt to the frequently occurring waterlogging environment and ensure better harvests, but also store a large amount of water, which is extremely effective in completely eliminating floods in the Huai River.
    This spring, the Huai River Management Committee selected Xujiagang (on the bank of the North Fei River), which has representative soil and terrain, to establish a rice cultivation experiment site and began trial planting of rice in order to promote it in the future. Before sowing, the staff of the rice cultivation experiment site first built the land into terraced fields, and then used multiple harrowing and raking methods to solve the problem of water leakage. They also eliminated pests in time during the rice growth period, making the rice planting experiment a complete success. This good news eloquently tells people that rice can be planted in miscellaneous grain producing areas north of the Huai River that are prone to waterlogging. Recently, farmers near Xujiagang have been visiting the rice cultivation experiment site in groups, and even farmers in Fuyang Special District, three or four hundred miles away, have sent people to visit and learn rice planting methods.

    Xinjiang Cotton Fields Have a Bumper Harvest
    Cotton farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province are excitedly picking first bloom cotton, and new cotton is being put on the market one after another. This year, the cotton growing on 650,000 mu of land in Xinjiang Province is better than in previous years. The cotton plants are as high as two chi, each plant has about 20 bolls, and there are an average of 3,000 to 4,000 cotton seedlings per mu. According to surveys in various places, this year each mu of cotton field can generally harvest more than 100 jin of seed cotton, and the highest can reach 300 to 400 jin. The cotton grows even better in the main cotton producing areas of the Turpan Basin and Kuqa, Kuerle, and other counties. The Yiming Niyazi mutual aid group in Turpan County has 43 mu of cotton fields, with an average yield of 300 jin of seed cotton per mu, and 10 mu of high-yield fields can yield 600 jin per mu. During the picking of first bloom cotton, farmers of all ethnic groups organize visiting groups to learn from each other. Agricultural technical guidance stations in various places have also printed publicity materials in Uyghur, such as cotton seed selection technology. State-owned trading organizations and cooperatives are sending mobile teams to cotton producing areas to purchase new cotton.

    Large Quantities of New Wool from Northwest China Enter the Market
    Now is the peak season for wool production, and most of the wool in pastoral areas has been shorn. Herdsmen are transporting wool from remote grasslands to the market in groups. In early August, an average of more than 5,000 jin of wool was put on the market in Xining City every day. On August 12th, the amount of wool put on the market increased to more than 9,000 jin. More than 20,000 jin of wool are put on the market every day in Xiahe, Gansu. From August 1st to 6th, Guide County, Qinghai held a materials exchange meeting. During the meeting, more than 190,000 jin of wool were put on the market, with more than 800 sellers, most of whom were Tibetan compatriots. A large amount of wool is also being put on the market in Bayanhot in Ningxia, Dingbian, Yulin, and Suide in northern Shaanxi, and other places.
    In order to better meet the needs of farmers and herdsmen to sell wool in exchange for production and living materials, the Northwest District Company of the China Animal Products Company has arranged for its affiliated companies at all levels to strengthen purchasing work and closely contact trading companies and cooperatives to expand the purchasing network. Correctly implement price policies, simplify purchasing procedures, and provide convenience to herdsmen who sell wool as much as possible.

    Xinjiang Province Continues to Promote the Lanha Sheep Breed
    The People's Government of Xinjiang Province continues to promote the Lanha sheep breed in various parts of Xinjiang. This year, it is planned to mate 150,000 local sheep with Lanha sheep. Now, Xinjiang Province is actively carrying out various preparations before sheep mating. The 156 students of all ethnic groups who graduated from the sheep artificial insemination training course held by the Animal Husbandry Department of the People's Government of Xinjiang Province have been assigned to work in breeding stations in various places. The construction of ten new artificial insemination stations and three sperm transfer stations planned to be built on the grasslands this year is underway. More than 600 Lanha breeding sheep specially used for artificial insemination and more than 1,400 Lanha breeding sheep loaned to farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups for natural mating have been transported to various places. More than 270 technical cadres of all ethnic groups at the 30 artificial insemination stations across the province are intensively carrying out publicity work on improving sheep breeds and sheep registration work. It is expected that the sheep mating work will begin in late October this year. At present, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in pastoral areas such as Ili, Tacheng, and Ashan are actively selecting strong female sheep with pure coat colors and preparing to send them to artificial insemination stations and Lanha sheep breeding sheep for mating. Farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in areas such as Sulai and Qitai have also formulated plans for improving sheep breeds through artificial insemination and hybridization this year. After mastering the technology of artificial insemination with the help of technical cadres at the artificial insemination station, Haji and two other Kazakh herdsmen in the Tacheng pastoral area recently sent a telegram to the Animal Husbandry Department of the Provincial People's Government to purchase three sets of artificial insemination equipment for them and prepare to establish their own artificial insemination station to promote the Lanha sheep breed.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    提制硼砂新法试验成功
    四川自流井的盐卤内，除含有食盐外，并含有丰富的制造硼砂的原料和氯化钾等贵重的副产物。硼砂是搪瓷、玻璃、医药工业原料；氯化钾是炸药、火柴原料。在国民党反动统治时，这些重要的工业原料，在制盐过程中，大量的被浪费了。中央轻工业部为了自贡硼砂新厂的基本建设，研究新的生产程序，提高硼砂产量，指派重庆工业试验所的工业原料组到自贡市，与自贡盐务管理局及所属新厂筹备处的技术人员组织研究试验，五个月来，由现厂生产程序的调查了解，数种提制硼砂新法的试验结果，其中以冷冻法最宜于大规模的生产，经反复试验，已获成功。旧法提制硼砂的生产程序繁杂，使制造硼砂的原料分散损失，生产收回率很低；新的冷冻法，系先将制盐的母液浓缩，使制造硼砂的原料与氯化钾一同以固体状态析出，再加水加纯碱来蒸煮，制成硼砂与氯化钾的混合溶液，最后经冷冻处理，使硼砂与氯化钾分离，这样简化了生产程序，集中的收回硼砂和氯化钾，提高了硼砂和氯化钾的产量。将来自贡硼砂新厂即采用冷冻法来进行生产，硼砂生产量可比旧法提高八·七四倍，氯化钾的生产量将增加二·一三倍，预计每年可为国家创造财富二百六十三亿元。    （刘言明）
    申万祥砌砖小组连创新纪录
    山西省工程公司第三工区八○二工地申万祥砌砖小组（固定编组六人），自从爱国生产竞赛满地红运动以来，在保证质量，安全生产的基础上，屡次创造砌基砖新纪录：第一次创造每日砌砖一万二千零四十块的纪录；第二次达到一万六千七百一十七块；第三次达到二万一千九百六十块；八月十六日在某工程砌基砖时，又创造了每日砌砖三万零八百五十一块的新纪录。因此，申万祥曾出席山西省劳动模范大会。
    申万祥小组所以能连创新纪录，主要是他们工作有计划有准备，并大力推广了先进经验。他们小组常常在操作前一天，就按计划把砖运到工地，有的工地离水远，用水不方便，他们事先在工地四周挖好小水沟，这样工作起来又方便又省事。由于他们掌握了稳、准、快三大要领，所以小组里技工，壮工、徒工分工非常明确，例如在砌砖时，技工砌砖、徒工铺灰，壮工递砖，既不紊乱，又能保证质量，提高效率。申万祥同志是中国共产党候补党员，在党支部领导下他团结全组工友，经常研究改进工作方法。每星期开一次技术研究会，请技术员讲解各种先进经验，现在，他们小组普遍运用“双手砌砖挤浆法”、“先水后浆灌浆法”、“梯级挂线木耙铺灰法”等先进经验，这对保证质量提高效率起了决定性的作用。为了保证工作顺利进行，他们小组建立了严格的交接班制度和检查制度。同时小组生活也很健全，他们每星期四召开生活检讨会，开展批评与自我批评，改进工作。

    淮河北岸杂粮产区试种水稻成功
    安徽省淮河北岸杂粮产区今年第一次长出了五十五亩水稻。这些水稻是治淮委员会在蚌埠以北徐家港建立的稻作试验场所试种的。水稻长得很好，金黄色的稻穗沉沉下垂。现在部分早稻已经登场，中稻不久也将收割；产量平均每亩在七百斤左右，最高的可达一千斤。米的成色和长江两岸的一样。
    安徽省淮河以北宿县、阜阳两专区有很多地方地势低洼，排水不畅，经常遭受内涝和水灾。这些地区过去每年春天播种高粱、绿豆等杂粮，秋季播种小麦，从来没有种过水稻。农民认为这里是“漏风土”，怎么也不会长出水稻。两年多来，治淮委员会除做了许多除涝工程外，并开始试验使这些地区种植旱地作物改为种植耐水作物。这不仅可以使作物适应经常发生内涝的环境，保证有较好的收成；而且可以大量蓄水，对彻底消除淮河水灾极为有效。
    治淮委员会在今年春天选择了土壤和地形有代表性的徐家港（在北淝河边上），建立了一个稻作试验场，开始试种水稻，以便将来推广。稻作试验场的工作人员在播种前先把地修筑成畦田，再用多耙多耖的办法解决了漏水问题，稻子生长期间又及时消灭了虫害，使种稻试验完全成功。这个喜讯雄辩地告诉人们：在淮河北岸经常发生内涝的杂粮产区是可以种植水稻的。最近，徐家港附近的农民成群结队地前往稻作试验场参观，连远在三四百里路外的阜阳专区的农民也派人赶来参观，并学习种稻的办法。    （新华社）
    新疆棉田丰收
    新疆省各族棉农兴奋地收摘头花，各地新棉正陆续上市。今年，新疆全省六十五万亩地的棉花，生长情况比往年好。棉株高达二尺，每株结桃二十个左右，平均每亩地有棉苗三千到四千株。据各地调查，今年每亩棉田一般可收籽棉一百多斤，最高达三、四百斤。主要棉产区吐鲁番盆地和库车、库尔勒等县，棉花生长更好。吐鲁番县伊明尼亚孜互助组四十三亩棉田，平均每亩可产籽棉三百斤，十亩丰产田每亩可收到六百斤。各族农民在收摘头花中，组织参观小组，互相观摩。各地农业技术指导站也印发了维吾尔文的棉花选种技术等宣传材料。国营贸易机构和合作社正派出流动小组，深入产棉区收购新棉。

    西北新羊毛大量上市
    现在正是产毛旺季，牧区羊毛大部已剪落，牧民们成群结队的从遥远的草原上驮运着羊毛到市场来。西宁市八月上旬平均每日上市五千多斤，八月十二日上市羊毛增到九千余斤。甘肃夏河每天羊毛上市量两万多斤。青海贵德县八月一日到六日举行了物资交流会，会期中上市羊毛达十九万多斤，有八百多户卖主，大都是藏族同胞。其他宁夏的巴音浩特、陕北的定边、榆林、绥德等地羊毛上市也很多。
    中国畜产公司西北区公司，为了更好地满足农牧民出售羊毛换回生产与生活资料的要求，已布置所属各级公司加强收购工作并密切与贸易公司和合作社联系，扩大收购网。正确执行价格政策，简化收购手续，尽量给出售羊毛的牧民以便利。
    新疆省继续推广蓝哈羊品种
    新疆省人民政府在新疆各地继续推广蓝哈羊品种。今年计划用蓝哈羊交配的土种绵羊共有十五万只。现在，新疆省正在积极进行羊只交配前的各项准备工作。新疆省人民政府畜牧厅举办的绵羊人工授精讲习会毕业的一百五十六名各族学员，已分配到各地配种站工作。今年计划在草原上新建的十个人工授精站和三个输精站，现在正修建房舍。专供人工授精用的六百多只蓝哈羊种羊和贷给各族牧民作自然交配用的一千四百多只蓝哈羊种羊，都已运往各地。全省三十个人工授精站的二百七十多名各族技术干部，正紧张地进行改良羊种的宣传工作和绵羊登记工作。羊只交配工作预计在今年十月下旬就可开始。目前，伊黎、塔城、阿山等牧区各族牧民正在积极挑选身体健壮、毛色纯洁的母羊，准备送到人工授精站和蓝哈羊种羊交配。绥来、奇台等地的各族牧民并订出了今年用人工授精杂交改良绵羊的计划。塔城牧区的哈萨克族牧民哈吉等三人，在人工授精站技术干部的帮助下，掌握了人工授精的技术后，最近还打电报请省人民政府畜牧厅给他们代购人工授精器械三套，准备自己成立人工授精站，推广蓝哈羊品种。
