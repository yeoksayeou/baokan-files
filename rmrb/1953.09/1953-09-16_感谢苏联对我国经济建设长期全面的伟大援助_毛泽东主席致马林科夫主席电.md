    Thanking the Soviet Union for its Long-Term and Comprehensive Great Assistance to China's Economic Construction
    Chairman Mao Zedong's Telegram to Chairman Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union:
    Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union:
    The Central People's Government Committee of the People's Republic of China, at its meeting on September 15, 1953, listened with satisfaction to the report by Comrade Li Fuchun, representative of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China, on the discussions with the Soviet Government regarding the Soviet Government's assistance to China's economic construction. The Central People's Government Committee unanimously believes that, thanks to the great Soviet Government's agreement to provide systematic economic and technical assistance in the construction and reconstruction of 91 new enterprises in China and the 50 enterprises under construction and reconstruction, the Chinese people will be able to gradually establish their own powerful heavy industry by learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and latest technological achievements. This is of extremely great significance for China's industrialization, for China's gradual transition to socialism, and for strengthening the power of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The resolution of the construction of 91 enterprises and the long-term assistance issue by the two countries in one discussion is a historical initiative, which fully embodies the truth stated by the great Stalin: "The experience of this cooperation shows that no capitalist country can give the people's democracies such real and technically proficient help as the Soviet Union. The point is not only that this help is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The main point is that the foundation of this cooperation is mutual assistance and a sincere desire to achieve a common economic upsurge."
    During the discussions, based on its rich experience in over 30 years of great socialist construction, the Soviet Government put forward various principled and specific suggestions for the tasks of our country's Five-Year Plan. These suggestions will help us avoid many mistakes and take fewer detours as much as possible in the process of China's economic construction.
    On behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Government and the Soviet people for this great, comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance. The Chinese Government and the Chinese people are willing to strengthen the economic cooperation and friendly alliance between the Soviet Union and China with their unremitting efforts, in order to jointly strive for the cause of world peace.
    Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
    September 15, 1953, in Beijing

    感谢苏联对我国经济建设长期全面的伟大援助
    毛泽东主席致马林科夫主席电苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议主席马林科夫同志：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府委员会，在一九五三年九月十五日举行的会议上，满意地听取了中华人民共和国政府代表团的代表李富春同志所作的关于与苏联政府商谈苏联政府对我国经济建设援助问题的报告。中央人民政府委员会一致认为，由于伟大的苏联政府同意在建设和改建中国的九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建的五十个企业中给以系统的经济的和技术的援助，中国人民将能够在学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术成就的努力之下，逐步地建立起自己的强大的重工业，这对于中国工业化、使中国逐步地过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，都具有极其重大的作用。
    两个国家在一次商谈中解决了九十一个企业的建设问题，解决了长期的援助问题，这在历史上是创举，完全体现了伟大的斯大林所说的真理：“这个合作的经验表明，没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”
    在商谈过程中，苏联政府根据它三十多年来的伟大社会主义建设的丰富经验，对于我国五年计划任务提出了各项原则的和具体的建议。这些建议将帮助我们在中国经济建设过程中尽可能地避免许多错误和少走许多弯路。
    我谨代表中国政府和中国人民对于苏联政府和苏联人民这种伟大的、全面的、长期的、无私的援助，表示衷心的感谢。中国政府和中国人民愿以自己的不懈的努力来加强苏中两国的经济合作和友好同盟，以利为世界和平事业的共同奋斗。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东
    一九五三年九月十五日于北京
