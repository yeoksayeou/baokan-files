State-Owned Businesses and Cooperatives in Various Provinces and Cities
Actively Prepare to Supply Goods for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival

State-owned commercial departments, cooperatives, and private businesses in various provinces and cities across the country are actively preparing various goods to ensure that people everywhere can happily celebrate National Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival.

The commercial bureaus and industrial and commercial administrative bureaus of Beijing, Tianjin, and other cities have successively convened meetings of relevant state-owned trading companies and cooperatives to study the needs of residents for festival supplies and formulate plans for supplying festival goods. The Harbin branch of the China Department Store Company also dispatched cadres to conduct surveys on residents' needs for the festival. Based on the increase in people's purchasing power, the quantity of goods planned to be supplied for National Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival in various places this year is generally higher than last year. The supply of pigs, cattle, and sheep in Beijing will increase by several thousand compared to the actual transaction volume during the same period last year, fruits will increase by more than 2 million jin, and mooncakes will increase by more than 200,000 jin. The supply of pork in Shanghai will increase by 30% compared to the same period last year, and the Shanghai Native Produce Company plans to supply 26 kinds of commodities, such as fresh pears, apples, mooncakes, and ham, which will exceed 50% of the actual sales volume in the same period last year. The number of mooncakes that the Kaifeng State-Owned Commercial Company and cooperatives plan to supply has increased by one-third compared to last year.

Currently, state-owned, private businesses, and cooperatives in various provinces and cities are actively purchasing and supplying a wide variety of festival goods suitable for residents' needs. The Beijing Native Produce Company, the Municipal Cooperative General Office, and private industries have gone to Xushui, Wangdu, and the Northwest to purchase pigs, cattle, sheep, vegetables, fish, shrimp, and eggs. Apples, grapes, and Ya pears have been continuously transported from producing areas such as Baoding and Changping. State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Kaifeng, and other places have begun to sell mooncakes, vermicelli, etc., which were commissioned and ordered locally. The Tianjin Aquatic Products Company also dispatched fishing boats to Qingdao, Tanggu, and Beitang to transport various fresh fish. The Liaoxi Provincial Cooperative General Office sent people to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places in July to purchase festival supplies. Cooperatives and grassroots societies in Wanquan, Shangyi, Huailai, and other counties in Hebei Province ordered 180,000 jin of fruit in August and organized the processing of 580,000 jin of mooncakes to supply the needs of farmers for the Mid-Autumn Festival. The Chengguan District and Xiabahe District Cooperatives in Xishui County, Hubei Province, have prepared a large number of festival goods and are preparing to hold a material exchange fair during the Mid-Autumn Festival to supply festive goods and purchase agricultural and sideline products. In order to enable residents to happily celebrate National Day, the Shenyang branch of the China Department Store Company is organizing public and private art studios to draw portraits of leaders and has prepared a large number of new festival costumes.

In order to avoid crowding during the festival, the Beijing Municipal Cooperative General Office plans to organize forces to assist district federations in distributing goods to various government offices, construction sites, factories, schools, and organizations. The Shanghai Native Produce Company is stepping up preparations to expand the business of its stores. The Shenyang Joint Company has added counters for supplying festival goods. In order to ensure the stability of commodity prices during the festival, the industrial and commercial bureaus of Xi'an and other cities have decided to strengthen the management of private businesses and strictly prevent illegal activities such as raising prices and disrupting the market. The Beijing and Shanghai Federations of Industry and Commerce have also successively convened meetings of representatives from various private industries to mobilize them to work under the leadership of the state-owned economy to do a good job in supplying goods for the festival and continue to stabilize prices.
