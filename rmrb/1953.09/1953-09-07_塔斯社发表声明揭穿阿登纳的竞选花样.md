Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: TASS, Moscow, September 4th: On September 3rd, West Berlin newspapers reported a statement by Adenauer, Prime Minister of the Bonn government. In his statement, Adenauer told the Soviet government, "If the Soviet government is prepared, along with other major powers, to seek a genuinely free solution to the German problem, a basis for peaceful coexistence among nations can be established."

TASS considers it necessary to state that Soviet leaders regard Adenauer's statement as nothing more than an election campaign trick.

Adenauer's statement is intended to confuse West German voters and obscure the true nature of the Bonn government's policies. The Adenauer government's record over the past four years shows that its policies are one of the main obstacles to consolidating peace in Europe and the reunification of Germany.

It is well known that Adenauer and the militarist revanchists who support him are working hard to build an army in West Germany as part of the so-called "European Army" and are trying to get West Germany to join the North Atlantic aggressive bloc used against the Soviet Union. To this end, the Adenauer government signed the Paris Treaties and the Bonn Treaty. The former stipulates the organization of the "European Army," and the latter stipulates that West Germany will be tied to the chariot of the three major powers, led by the United States, which seeks to achieve world hegemony, for the next fifty years, and that foreign troops will be legally stationed in West Germany during the aforementioned years. Neither the Bonn Treaty nor the Paris Treaties have yet come into effect because they have met with serious resistance in many countries. It is well known that in West Germany itself, there is growing resistance to the implementation of these treaties, which only benefit the aggressive bloc.

It is no accident that Adenauer is now exerting all his strength to enhance the status of his government, unscrupulously planning to win votes in the upcoming elections, and then hurriedly finally passing the Bonn and Paris Treaties to conform to the expectations of the American aggressive bloc that pursues its own interests in Europe and around the world.

It must not be forgotten that if the Paris and Bonn Treaties are truly hastily passed and begin to be implemented, West Germany, which signed the treaties, can no longer be regarded as a peace-loving country; it will become a tool of the North Atlantic bloc's aggressive plans, and it will eventually embark on the road of preparing for a new war in Europe.

Once the Paris and Bonn Treaties come into effect, the reunification of Germany will be impossible to restore. However, it must not be ignored that the German Democratic Republic has clearly stated that it will never allow eastern Germany to be dragged into the net of the North Atlantic bloc and its plans to enslave Germany. On the other hand, it would be absurd for anyone to think that the Soviet Union could support such a plan that opposes the Soviet Union and aims to create another dangerous hotbed of aggression in the center of Europe, or that the Soviet Union would support such a plan that runs counter to the interests of all peace-loving people, especially the German people themselves and the people of West Germany's neighboring countries.

### 塔斯社发表声明揭穿阿登纳的竞选花样

    塔斯社发表声明揭穿阿登纳的竞选花样
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：九月三日，西柏林报纸报道波恩政府阿登纳总理的一个声明。阿登纳在他的声明中对苏联政府说，“如果苏联政府准备与其他大国一起，谋求真正自由解决德国问题，各国和平共处的基础是能够建立起来的。”
    塔斯社认为有必要声明，苏联的领导人士认为阿登纳的这篇声明不过是竞选运动中的一个花样而已。
    阿登纳的声明用意在于迷惑西德选民，使他们弄不清楚波恩政府政策的真正性质。阿登纳和他的集团执政四年的政绩表明：阿登纳政府所奉行的政策是阻碍巩固欧洲和平和德国国家统一的主要障碍之一。
    大家都知道，阿登纳和支持他的军国主义复仇分子都努力想在西德建立一支军队，以作为所谓“欧洲军”的一部分，并设法使西德加入用来反对苏联的北大西洋侵略集团。为这目的，阿登纳政府签订了巴黎条约和波恩条约，前者规定组织“欧洲军”，后者规定在今后五十年期间内把西德束缚在以力谋取得世界霸权的美国为首的三大国的战车上，并使外国军队在上述的年份中驻扎在西德成为合法的事。无论波恩条约还是巴黎条约都还没有生效，因为它们在许多国家内遭到严重的抵抗。大家都知道，就是在西德，要实行这些只对侵略集团有利的条约，也遭到日益增长的抵抗。
    阿登纳恰巧在现在使出他全部力量来提高他的政府的地位，不择手段地打算在即将来到的选举中获取选票，然后赶紧最后地通过波恩和巴黎条约，以符在欧洲和全世界追求一己利益的美国侵略集团的期望。这实在不是偶然的。
    不能够忘记，假使巴黎和波恩条约真正被草草通过，并且开始实行的话，在条约上签了字的西德就再也不能被视为爱好和平的国家；它将变成北大西洋集团侵略计划的工具，它最后将走上准备欧洲新战争的道路。
    巴黎和波恩条约一旦生效，德国的统一便不可能恢复。然而，决不能忽视这个事实，就是德意志民主共和国已经明确表明过：它决不允许德国东部被拖入北大西洋集团的罗网和它的奴役德国的计划中去。另外一方面，谁要以为苏联能支持这种反对苏联的并且目的在于在欧洲中心再建立另外一个危险的侵略温床的计划，谁要以为苏联支持这种与所有爱好和平的人民的利益，主要是与德国人民自己以及西德邻国人民的利益背道而驰的计划，那未免太荒唐了。
