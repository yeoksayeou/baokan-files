    Going to Beijing
    Cui Bawa
    Editor's Note: This year on May Day International Labor Day, Cui Bawa came to the capital from the Northwest to participate in the parade. These are two excerpts from his diary; the title was added by the editor.

I. In fact, the leader had told me a long time ago that I would be part of the Northwest "May Day" parade delegation going to Beijing. In the past two days, I was busy organizing my novel "A Wine Pot" and forgot about it. This morning, I was hunched over my desk writing when Comrade Yang Shangwu suddenly pushed open the door and came in, saying to me, "Comrade Cui Bawa, the Minister wants to talk to you." Suddenly, I felt a little nervous. What's the matter? I have a strange habit: before seeing a leader, I always like to prepare what I want to say beforehand. I often don't know what to say when I see a leader. Sometimes, I have thought it through beforehand, but I panic at the last minute and can't use it. So, this time, I still walked and thought: learning, work, ideology... my brain spun like a waterwheel, and before I could think it through, I was already at the door of the Minister's office. In the end, I guessed: it must be a learning issue. I straightened my clothes, and at the door I shouted, "Report!" After entering and saluting, the Minister asked me to sit down, and he turned around and smiled at me. What a loving smile! I can't express this kind of feeling in words. I remember my mother once had this kind of affectionate smile when she saw me. After a pause, he said, "This time you are going to Beijing to participate in the 'May Day' parade and will see our great leader Chairman Mao. This is a very good learning opportunity. When you see the vastness and prosperity of the motherland and the vigorous economic construction, you will increase your love for the motherland... You must humbly learn from heroes and models, learn their noble qualities of fighting bravely and working selflessly for the Party and the people..." At that time, I was so happy that I forgot all the words I had prepared outside, and I couldn't find anything to say. I lowered my head and rubbed my hands. Then Deputy Minister Li said, "When you see Comrade Gao Yubao, you must learn from him..." The two leaders patiently instructed me as if they were sending a child to visit relatives, and I firmly remembered every word. As a result, I didn't say a word. The Minister shook my hand tightly, and I saluted the Minister again and walked out. As soon as I went out the door, it suddenly occurred to me: why didn't I say to the Minister just now, "Leader, please rest assured, I understand how the Party cultivates me and how the leaders care for me. I must study hard to repay the Party and the higher authorities." I was really angry with myself. In the afternoon, I received some clothes and organized my things, preparing to leave tomorrow.

II. The train moves forward along the railway with a clanging sound. Last night I heard that we were out of the mountains, I stretched my neck and looked out of the car, it was a dark mass, and the trees on the side of the road were flying backwards one after another. I didn't want to sleep, but my eyelids were fighting, and I didn't know when I fell asleep. In my dream, I vaguely heard someone shouting, "Yellow River Iron Bridge!" I jumped up and rubbed my eyes. Oh, it's dawn! I realized that I had slept for quite a while. I looked out the car window, wow! So bright, we've reached the plains. The flat land is all wheat, neatly standing at the same height, like a mat spread all the way to the horizon. The morning wind blows over, and the wheat is like a river, one wave chasing another. I turned around and asked a passenger, "How far is the Yellow River Iron Bridge?" "We just passed it." It turned out that they had already passed it when they were shouting. I blame myself for sleeping and delaying things.

    We're at the station again. Construction sites are everywhere here. Cement, bricks, and lumber are piled on the ground, and the workers are climbing up and down the scaffolding. Trucks are coming and going. As soon as the train stopped, many passengers came up. A young worker helped an old woman with white hair up, smiling. Because there were not enough seats, a soldier consciously gave up his seat to the old woman. The old woman looked at the soldier: "No, comrade, you sit."

    After pushing back and forth for a long time, the old woman was still unwilling to sit.
    "Grandma, this comrade is letting you sit, please sit down first." The young worker persuaded the old woman while helping her to sit down, and she shook her head and smiled as she sat down in her seat.
    The old woman said a little embarrassed: "Look at this! You're standing while I'm sitting."
    "It doesn't matter, it's okay for us young people to stand for a while."
    After a pause, the old woman asked the young worker, "I forgot to ask, what's your last name?"
    "Huh?" The young worker pushed his hat back and looked at the old woman: "Grandma, you have a good memory! Think about it, last May."
    "May?" The old woman was a little confused. The worker leaned closer to her:
    "At that time, we were building a house for you, and you were selected as a model of supporting the army in the whole district, and you are also a glorious military dependent..." Before he could finish speaking, she remembered:
    "Ah - so, you are Comrade Wang, aren't you?"
    "That's right! The old lady's memory is still good."
    "Oh! I'm old, and my eyes don't recognize people anymore..."
    "You must be going to the factory to see your daughter, am I right?"
    "Yes! That daughter of mine is so old, but still doesn't understand things. She only cares about herself. When she's busy, she wants me to come. I have to criticize her when I get there!" The old woman tilted her head and pouted.
    "Yes! You should criticize her, why did she think of her mother when she was busy?" the soldier interjected with a grin.
    Then someone came over with a cup of tea: "Old lady, have some tea!" "Grandma, eat my cookies!" A four- or five-year-old child said, crawling through the adults' legs. The old woman reached out and picked up the child....
    The train continues to move forward. The newly rising sun shines on the wheat, making it gleam with golden light, and everyone's faces in the car seem to be coated with rouge, looking particularly strong. I thought: People often sing that Chairman Mao is like the sun, what else can be used to compare Chairman Mao? Look at today, how harmonious our big family is, how happy and beautiful our life is! Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, our great motherland is advancing in the sun like this train.

    到北京去
    崔八娃
    编者按：今年五一国际劳动节，崔八娃由西北来到首都参加了观礼。这是从他的日记中选出的两段，题目是编者加的。一  其实，要我参加西北“五一”观礼代表团到北京去，首长早告诉过我了。近两天，我忙着整理我的小说“一把酒壶”，把这事也就忘下了。今天上午，我正爬在办公桌上写东西，杨尚武同志忽然从外边推开门进来，对我说：“崔八娃同志，部长找你谈话。”突然我心里有点紧张起来，有什么事啊？我有个怪毛病：自己在见首长以前总喜欢先把要说的话预备得好好的。我往往见了首长不知道说啥，有时在事先本来想得好好的，临时心里一慌乱就用不上了。所以，这次我还是边走边想：学习问题、工作、思想……，脑子里像水车似的转了一圈又一圈，还没等我想好，已经走到部长办公室的门口了。末后我猜着：准是学习问题。我把衣服整理了一下，在门外我就喊了个“报告！”进门敬完礼，部长叫我坐下，他转过身望着我笑了。这是多么慈爱的笑啊！这种感情我用言语都比划不出来，记得我妈看到我曾经有过这种感情的笑。停了一下，他说：“这次你到北京参加‘五一’观礼，要见到咱们伟大的领袖毛主席。这是个很好的学习机会，你看到了祖国的广大、富庶和那轰轰烈烈的经济建设，就更会增加你对祖国的热爱……要虚心向英雄、模范们学习，学习他们忠心耿耿地为党为人民英勇战斗、忘我工作的崇高品质……。”当时，我太高兴了，高兴得连我在外边想好的话都忘了个一干二净，找不着话说，我低下头来搓搓手。接着李副部长又说了：“去见了高玉宝同志要好好地向他学习……”两位首长像打发小孩走亲戚一样耐心地嘱咐，我把每一个字都牢牢地记下。结果，我没说一句话，部长和我紧紧地握了手，我又给部长敬了个礼，就走出来了。出了门，猛的想起来：为啥我刚才不跟部长说：“首长，请放心，党怎样培养我、首长怎样关心我，我都明白，我一定要好好学习，来回答党和上级。”我真生我自己的气。下午，领了单衣服，把东西整理了一下，准备明天就出发。二
    火车沿着铁路铿铿锵锵地前进。昨天晚上听说就出了山啦，我伸着脖子向车外望望，黑黝黝地一片，路旁的树一排一排地往后面飞跑。我心里不愿睡，可是眼皮直打架，搞不清啥时候我就睡着了。睡梦里影影绰绰地听到有人嚷：“黄河铁桥！”我一骨碌爬起来把眼一揉，哟，天亮啦！我才知道我睡的工夫不短了。我往车窗外一看，嗬！好眼亮，到了平原了。一马平川都是麦子，齐扎扎地一般高，像一张席一直铺展到天边。早晨的风吹过来，麦子像河水一样一个浪赶一个浪。我回头问一个旅客：“黄河铁桥还有多远？”“才过的就是。”原来他们嚷的时候已经过来了，怨我睡觉把事耽误了。
    又到车站了。这里到处是建设的工地。地上堆着水泥、砖、木料，工人同志们在架子上翻上翻下，运输汽车来来往往。火车一停下，又上来了很多旅客，一个青年工人扶着一位白发老太太笑喝喝地走上来，因为座位不够坐，一个战士自觉地把座位让给老太太，老太太朝那个战士看了看：“不，同志你坐吧。”
    推让了半天，老太太总是不愿意坐。
   “大娘，这位同志让您坐，您就先坐下吧。”青年工人一边劝着老太太，一边扶着她让她坐下来，她这才头摇摇地笑着坐到位子上。
    老太太有点不好意思地说：“看，这像啥！你站着倒叫我坐下。”
   “没关系，我们年轻人站一下不要紧。”
    停了一下，老太太问青年工人：“我忘了问，你贵姓？”
     “嗯？”青年工人把帽子往后一推，看着老太太：“大娘您好记性！您想想去年五月间吧。”
   “五月间？”老太太有点莫名其妙。工人探着身子凑近她：
      “那时我们正给您老人家盖房，您老人家被选为全区的拥军模范，您又是光荣的军属……”没等他说完，她想起来了：
    “啊——这么说，你是王同志不是？”
    “正是！老大娘的记性还不错。”
     “哎呀！老了，这个眼也不认人了……”
    “您准是到工厂里去看闺女的，我猜对了吧？”
      “是啊！我那个闺女这么大了，还不懂事，她只顾她自己，正忙的时候，她要我来，我非批评她一顿不结！”老太太头一歪，绷起嘴。
      “对！应该批评，为啥正忙的时候想妈呢？”那个战士也插嘴笑嘻嘻地说。
    接着有人端着一杯茶过来：“老大娘，喝茶吧！”“老奶奶，吃我的饼干吧！”一个四、五岁的娃娃，说着从大人腿缝里钻了过来。老太太伸手抱起了这个孩子……。
    火车继续前进。刚出来的太阳照得麦子闪金光，车里每个人的脸上像擦上胭脂似的，显得格外健壮。我想：人们常唱毛主席像太阳，别的又能拿啥来比喻毛主席呢？看今天，我们的大家庭多么和气，我们的生活是多么幸福和美满啊！我们伟大的祖国，在毛主席和共产党领导下，就像这列火车一样在阳光下面前进。
