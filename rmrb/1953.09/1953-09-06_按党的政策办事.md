Act According to the Party's Policies
By Yu Xianfu, Director of Changfa Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, Wangkui County
Reported by Fang Qing, Our Correspondent

My name is Yu Xianfu, and I am the director of the Changfa Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province. Last spring, when the cooperative was first established, I thought to myself – if we're going to do it, we have to do it big, make it impressive, make it fancy, that's what it means to "actively respond to the Party's call." As a result, out of the seventy-five households in the village, I pulled in fifty-two all at once. In addition to the five horses and one rubber-wheeled cart that the county lent us, we also opened a tofu workshop, a brick kiln, and a tailoring shop, and were busy all day building houses and finding craftsmen. We didn't even discuss it with the members; we, the two or three leaders, just discussed it and started doing it. I always thought: with a thousand mouths in the family, there's only one in charge; how can we do things well if everyone's talking at once! When we were clearing the land, Li Lin made a suggestion, complaining that the work was tiring. I immediately scolded him: "You're too lazy to lift a finger, why don't you just quit?" We also didn't organize the labor force properly, and every morning when we went to the fields, we'd divide up the work on the spot, all chaotic, with one person saying: "Director, what should I do?" and another saying: "Director, I don't even have a shovel." We couldn't get down to the fields until halfway through the morning. Not only in production, but also if someone's family was short of food, they'd come to the director; if a child was sick, they'd come to the director; if they wanted to buy some cloth on credit from the supply and marketing cooperative, they'd come to the director; if they didn't have buttons, they'd come to the director; and during the Dragon Boat Festival, they'd come to the director to ask for meat. Forced to the point of desperation, I slaughtered my own 280-斤 pig. I was busy with all these things, and I didn't pay much attention to production, and the result was – eight cattle and horses died, over sixty dan of grain were wasted, and not a single member didn't scold me. The members of the management committee each had their own ideas.

In the second half of the year, after being educated by the county Party committee and the district Party committee, and after attending the provincial representative meeting of agricultural production cooperatives and the representative meeting of labor models, I finally came to my senses. After careful consideration, I came to a conclusion – I hadn't been listening to the Party. The Party told me to advance steadily, but I just wanted to jump to socialism in one step; the Party told me to promote democracy, but I was practicing a patriarchal style of leadership; the Party told me to participate in production and lead production, but I only worked in the fields for seven days a year. This was because I hadn't studied the Party's policies properly and didn't understand the nature of the cooperative. Thinking about it, I really felt sorry for the Party – I was the only Party member in the cooperative – and sorry for all the members. Thinking about the painful situation, I was so anxious that I cried! At the meeting in the province, other cooperatives were talking about their good experiences, and I said: "I'm a bad example, and I'll talk about it too, so that everyone will remember not to make the same mistakes."

In January of this year, Secretary Xue of the County Party Committee came to our village and instructed us to summarize our experiences and taught us specific methods; this boosted my spirits again, and I cleaned up the mess and started all over again. Where we lost, we looked for it, and when we found the root cause of last year's problems, we were able to diagnose this year's issues accurately.

First, we rectified the organization. The deputy director, the production captain, and I considered it first, and then went to find good members to discuss how to run the cooperative this year. By this time, we already had about ten activists, so we convened a members' meeting. I first made a self-criticism, apologized to the members, and said I was sorry. When everyone saw that I had taken all the blame and didn't blame anyone else, they said: "We can't just blame the director, we all have some faults too." Then I went on to say: "The reason why we didn't run the cooperative well last year was because I was doing everything myself; this year we must be democratic and everyone must offer ideas. Joining and leaving the cooperative is completely voluntary, and leaving the cooperative won't be disadvantageous. Those who want to join should sign up." As a result, nineteen households signed up, with twenty-eight male laborers and fourteen female laborers. The remaining people found their own partners and formed mutual aid teams.

Afterwards, we held a new members' meeting. First, we decided to clean up last year's mess, contracting out the brick kiln and tofu workshop, and selling the sewing machine. Then we discussed how to farm the land. Huang Zhaosheng said: "This year, we can't just assign people randomly; a few people should form a team with a plow, and only change teams after the land is sown." This was a good start. Later, we formed four production teams – two farming teams, one odd-job team, and a separate women's team. Each team had a member of the management committee to lead it. Then, Wang Lin said: "Livestock and farm tools can't be grabbed randomly either. Each team should allocate carts, horses, plows, and other tools, and assign them to specific people for use and management, so that things won't be grabbed randomly." This is called division of labor and responsibility, with each item having an owner. I knew that the method of small-scale contracting was good, so I went to discuss it with Fang Yongchang, and he agreed. I encouraged him to bring up this method at the meeting, and as a result, everyone at the meeting agreed. We stipulated how much land a team of plowmen should sow in a day, and implemented short-term small-scale contracting fairly and equitably. In this way, people were organized into teams, tools were fixed, each person had a specific responsibility, and there was no chaos. Everyone was concerned about their own tasks and went to the fields early. Those who put in more effort earned more work points. It was no longer like last year, where everyone was included regardless of how much they worked, and there were constant arguments.

We not only participated in production, but also took the lead in production. When sowing the land, the director, deputy director, and production captain all took on tough roles – holding the plow and sowing the seeds. Later, we also implemented contracting for chopping grass, stipulating that three people should chop 250 bundles of grass a day. When I saw that they could complete the task without hurrying, and Liu Fu, who was feeding the horses, complained that the grass was too long, I realized that there was a problem. So I personally chopped grass for a day. First, I swept the yard clean and blocked it off with bundles of grass all around. When chopping, I added grass that was three or four fen long, at most half an inch. By nightfall, I had chopped 320 bundles. When those three grass-choppers saw what we had done, they also chopped the grass more finely – Liu Fu was very happy – and the quantity also increased, with a stipulation of 280 bundles of grass a day.

In the summer, we merged into three teams: hoeing, weeding, and cultivating. I personally led the hoeing team. Because there was a lot of rain this year, the grass and seedlings grew together, and insects also appeared, so I led the team in hoeing every day, organizing men and women to compete, and that's how we hoeed the land. One day, Fang Yongzhen said to me: "The wages for the women's weeding team are too high, and the male members are unhappy." When I heard this, I relapsed into my old ways and started arguing with him, with a thick neck and a red face: "You're afraid that they're earning too many workdays, and you want to disband the women's team, that's what you want!" After I said that, I felt that something was wrong. When I thought about how Secretary Xue of the County Party Committee had educated me, I immediately apologized to Fang Yongzhen, went over the details with him, and then went to see the land that the women had weeded, and the grass was really thick, so they didn't have any objections. When we harvested wheat, I also led the way. Bao Xianzhu, who was harvesting next to me, had a nick in his sickle. When I saw that he couldn't keep up, I took over one of his rows, I harvested four rows, and he harvested two rows. We harvested for more than half a li, and I didn't fall behind. I didn't understand before how you could lead while working all day. In fact, problems were solved by doing the work. Everyone discussed things in the fields, and everything could be done. This is truly – only when you participate in production can you lead production. The Party's instructions are always right, no matter how you think about them. Acting according to the Party's policies won't go wrong, that's my personal experience.

    按党的政策办事
    望奎县长发屯农业生产合作社主任  于显富  说
    本报记者  方青  记
    我叫于显富，是黑龙江省望奎县长发屯农业生产合作社主任。去年春天，乍一成立社，我心里就想——要办，就得够规模，像样子，排排场场，这才算“积极响应党的号召”。结果，全屯七十五户，一下子就叫我拉进来五十二户。除县上贷给的五匹大马，一辆胶轮车，我们还开了豆腐坊、砖窑、成衣铺，整天忙着盖房子、找手艺人。也没有经过社员讨论，我们三两个领导人一商量就操办。我老是想：家有千口，主事一人；七嘴八舌还能办好！刨槎子时，李林提意见，嫌活计累。我张嘴就骂他：“灵头幡轻巧，你怎么不去扛？”劳动力也没有好好组织，天天早晨下地时现分工，乱呛呛，这个说：“主任，我干啥？”那个又说：“主任，我还没有铁锹。”天天半头晌下不去地。不光是生产，谁家里缺粮食就找主任，孩子病了找主任，到供销社去赊点布也找主任，没有扣子又来找主任，过端午节，又来跟主任要肉吃，逼的没法，就把我家二百八十斤的大猪杀了。我净忙这些事，生产就没有多管，结果是——连牛带马死了八头，粮食糟踏六十多石，社员没一个不骂我的，管理委员会的委员是一个人一条心。
    下半年，经过县委、区委的教育，我又参加了省的农业生产合作社代表会，劳动模范代表会，这才醒过腔来。仔细一琢磨，得出一条教训——没有听党的话。党叫我稳步前进，我光想一步就迈到社会主义；党叫我发扬民主，我是家长式的领导；党叫我参加生产，领导生产，我一年才下地干七天活。这是因为我没有好好学习党的政策，不明白合作社是怎么个性质。想起来，真是对不起党——社里就我一个党员——对不起全体社员。想到痛心的地场，真把我急哭了！在省里开会，别的社都讲好的经验，我说：“我是个坏典型，也讲出来，叫大伙记着别再犯。”
    到今年一月，薛县委（书记）到我们屯里，指示我们总结经验，又教给具体办法；这才又鼓起我的劲来，收拾收拾烂摊子，重打锣鼓重开张。哪里丢，哪里找，找到了去年的病根，就摸准了今年的脉。
    先整顿组织。我和副主任、生产队长先考虑一下，分头去找好的社员，商量今年怎么办社。这时已经有了十来个积极分子，就召开社员大会。我先作了检讨，对社员赔不是，道歉。大伙一看我把错处都揽过来，一点也不埋怨别人，他们就说：“可也不能光怨主任，咱们也都有点错处。”我又接着说：“去年没办好社，就是因为我包办；今年一定要民主，大伙出主意。在社出社，完全靠自愿，出社也不让吃亏。愿入的就报名。”结果有十九户报了名，二十八个男劳动力，十四个女劳动力。下剩的各找对象，成立互助组。
    随后，我们开了新的社员会，先确定收拾去年的烂摊子，砖窑、豆腐坊都兑出去，缝纫机卖掉，然后再讨论怎么种地。黄照升说：“今年种地不能现配搭，几个人一付犁，编成组，种完地再变动。”这算起了个头。以后编成四个生产队——两个种地队，一个零活队，妇女单另编一队。每队都有管理委员会的委员来领导。随后王林又说：“牲口农具也不能乱抓，各队都把车马犁杖分配好，归谁使用，归谁经管，到时就不乱抓了。”这就叫分工负责，物各有主。我知道小包工的办法好，就找方永昌去商量，他也同意。我动员他开会时把这办法提出来，结果会上大伙都同意。规定好一付犁杖一天种多少地，公公道道，实行了短期小包工。这一来，人编了组，家具固定，各有专责，一点也不乱，各人都惦记各人的事，早早地就下地。谁多出力，谁多挣分。再不像去年那样，干多干少，一包在内，整天争争吵吵。
    我们不光参加生产，还要在生产上带头。种地时，正副主任、生产队长，都是担任硬实角色——扶犁、点种。后来铡草也实行包工，规定三个人一天铡二百五十捆草。我一看他们不紧不慢也能完成，喂马的刘富提意见说草太长，我一琢磨，这里有问题。我就亲自铡了一天草。先把院子扫的挺干净，转圈拿草捆挡上。铡时我续草，一刀三、四分长，顶多不过半寸，到天黑铡了三百二十捆。原来那三个铡草的一看我们作出了样子，也就铡的挺碎——刘富可高兴了——数量也提高了，规定一天铡二百八十捆。
    到夏天，合并成铲地、?地、薅地三个队。我亲自领导铲地那个队。因为今年雨水大，草苗一齐长，虫子也上来了，我就天天在地里领着铲，组织男女竞赛，这才把地铲过来了。有一天，房永珍跟我说：“妇女薅地的工资过高，男社员不高兴。”我一听又犯老毛病了，粗脖子红脸地跟他吵起来：“你们这是怕人家挣劳动日，把妇女队解散，就对你们的心思了！”说过以后，我就感觉不对。一想起薛县委怎么教育我，我当时就跟房永珍认错，跟他一算细账，又一起去看了看妇女薅的地，草实在多，他们也就都没意见了。割小麦，我也在前边领着干。和我挨着割的包宪州，镰刀碰了个豁子，我一看他跟不上，就揽过他一条垅来，我割四垅，他割两垅，一直割了半里多地，我也没有落后。先前我不明白，整天干活怎么能领导呢？其实，干着活就解决了问题了。大家在地头上一商量，什么事都能办。这真正是——只有你参加生产，才能领导生产。党的指示，怎么琢磨怎么对。按党的政策办事不会错，这就是我的亲身体会。
