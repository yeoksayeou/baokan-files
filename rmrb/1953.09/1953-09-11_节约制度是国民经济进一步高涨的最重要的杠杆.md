The Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are successfully completing the great task of communist construction. The powerful socialist industry is advancing vigorously. The strength of heavy industry, which is the main foundation of the socialist economy, is increasing year by year. The development of light industry and the food industry has reached a high level, and it is possible to increasingly satisfy the growing needs of urban and rural residents on the basis of a policy of reducing prices. Our socialist agriculture also has made significant achievements.

The Soviet people have achieved historically significant results in economic and cultural construction. However, many unresolved tasks still lie before the Soviet people.

In order to realize the magnificent program of communist construction, and to complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to seek, discover, and utilize the huge reserves hidden within the national economy, implement a thrift system in all aspects of economic construction, and increase the profitability of enterprises.

I. The Necessity of a Thrift System in
	Socialist Society

In the socialist system, thrift is a necessity of life, determined by the basic economic law of socialism, and is in line with the fundamental interests of all working people. As everyone knows, the purpose of socialist production is to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society. These needs can only be met by continuously growing and improving socialist production on a high technical basis.

The growth of socialist production is achieved through domestic resources and internal accumulation. The more rational and thrifty the economic management, the more accumulation will be generated, and the more effective the utilization of existing potential will be for society. "The less time society requires to produce food, livestock, etc., the more time it will win to engage in other production, material or spiritual. Whether it is an individual or a society, its development, its consumption, and its overall activities depend on the economy of time." (Marx-Engels Library, Volume IV, Page 119)

The essence of the thrift system lies in a loving and responsible attitude towards socialist property, in the rational and careful use of labor, materials, and financial resources, and in the prevention of losses and non-productive expenditures in all sectors and management links of the national economy.

In Soviet society, the saved funds are used to ensure high-speed socialist expanded reproduction, to develop industry and socialist agriculture on a high technical basis, and to seek a continuous improvement in the welfare of the Soviet people. Through the implementation of the thrift policy, production activities can achieve the greatest results under the conditions of expending the least amount of effort and funds.

The capitalist mode of production is fundamentally wasteful. Particularly wasteful is modern monopoly capitalism, whose production goal is to obtain maximum profit. Of course, monopoly capitalists strive to be thrifty in all aspects when organizing production. However, this "thrift" has an anti-social and anti-people nature. First of all, capitalist "thrift" is accompanied by a shocking intensification of labor. The purpose of this "thrift" is to oppose workers, meaning increasingly strengthening the exploitation of workers and peasants and treating the lives and health of the working people cruelly. Secondly, capitalist "thrift" in individual enterprises is accompanied by huge non-productive expenditures of funds in the circulation sphere, and by shocking waste throughout the capitalist mode of production.

The extremely slow development of productive forces resulting from the contradiction between productive forces and production relations, the anarchy of production, the periodically recurring overproduction and economic crises, the militarization of the economy, the parasitic phenomena of the exploiting classes, the frequent under-capacity operation of enterprises, the destruction of products, and many other phenomena in the economic life of modern capitalist society, all irrefutably prove the immeasurable waste of modern capitalism.

In contrast to capitalism, the socialist mode of production opens up infinitely broad space for the development of productive forces, eliminates economic crises, under-capacity operation of enterprises, and unemployment—for the first time in history creating objective possibilities for the rational and truly thrifty management of the entire economy for the benefit of society.

Socialism eliminates the roots that produce waste. In the socialist system, there are no exploiting classes. The working people themselves are the masters of the means of production and the material values they create. They are willing to use social wealth in the most thrifty and diligent way. Socialist society realizes the planned distribution of material and labor resources among various economic sectors in a way that benefits the people. This is an important condition for large-scale savings, product conservation, and continuous improvement of the economic efficiency of social labor consumption.

The systematic reduction of industrial product costs illustrates the important significance and achievements of the thrift policy in the development of the socialist national economy. For example, one percent reduction in the cost of industrial products in 1950 saved more than four billion rubles. This is many times greater than at the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, when one percent reduction in cost was equivalent to 150 to 200 million rubles. In 1951, savings in reducing the cost of industrial products (including savings due to lower wholesale prices of raw materials) amounted to 35.5 billion rubles. In 1952, these savings amounted to more than 46 billion rubles.

The directives of the 19th Party Congress stipulated that the cost of industrial products should be reduced by approximately 25 percent during the Fifth Five-Year Plan. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the huge funds saved in reducing production and circulation costs in the national economy should be approximately equal to two-thirds of the total investment in the national economy.

Therefore, the more thrifty and rational our economic management becomes, the greater the achievements the Soviet people will obtain in the development of the socialist economy, and in the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards.

II. The Thrift System is the Socialist
	Method of Management

The Party and the government are tirelessly concerned with the consolidation of socialist property, manage the public economy in the most economical way, lead the opposition to mismanagement and waste, and strive to gradually implement a thrift system in all aspects of production, circulation, and management. In order to manage the economy thriftily and prudently, it is necessary to master the production of the economy.

In order to implement a strict thrift system, our economic workers must take into account the role of the law of value. Under the socialist system, the scope of the law of value is limited: this law is not the regulator of social production in our country. However, as J.V. Stalin pointed out, this law still affects our production and cannot be ignored when leading production. Therefore, in our enterprises, economic accounting, profitability, cost, price, and other issues are of practical significance.

The impact of the law of value on socialist production is a positive factor under the current conditions, because it educates economic workers to carry out production rationally, teaches them to calculate production volume, seek and utilize potential reserves instead of trampling on them, teaches them to improve production methods, reduce production costs, implement economic accounting, and enable enterprises to be profitable.

The most important lever for implementing the thrift system is the economic accounting system, which is a method of managing socialist enterprises in a planned way. The basis of the economic accounting system is the actual operational independence of the enterprise, and the enterprise is economically responsible for the most effective utilization, and the most appropriate expenditure of material and financial resources for production capacity.

It should be pointed out that the thrift system, this important socialist management method, has not been fully utilized by the leaders of many economic organizations, resulting in huge losses to the socialist economy. Many economic workers have not mastered the production of the economy. Economic accounting is still only formally implemented in many enterprises. Some economic leaders damage the interests of the entire country by deliberately creating "reserves" in production cost plans by raising the standards for raw material consumption and product labor volume. It is not uncommon for the poor performance of some enterprises to be covered up by the good performance of other enterprises, while government departments are satisfied with the average indicators of the entire sector, and do not take appropriate measures to bring backward enterprises up to the level of advanced enterprises.

Defects such as imbalanced production processes, rushes, intermittent work, and violations of normal production rhythms have caused huge damage to the national economy. At the beginning of the month, many enterprises work loosely, but by the end of the month, the entire production mechanism feels a sharp overload. This causes disruption of the normal production process, insufficient utilization of production capacity, loss of work time at the beginning of the month, expenditure of large amounts of funds at the end of the month, unnecessary overtime work, increased waste, excessive consumption of raw materials, fuel, and electricity, and ultimately an increase in production costs.

For example, the fact that losses and non-productive expenditures of Soviet industrial enterprises in 1951 reached 4.9 billion rubles, of which 3 billion rubles were losses due to waste, proves that there are serious shortcomings in industrial work, and also proves that there are huge reserves for increasing internal accumulation in the economy.

The scale of our construction projects is constantly growing. However, as pointed out by the 19th Party Congress, the thrift system is implemented particularly poorly in construction work. For example, in 1951, overhead expenses in construction work exceeded 1 billion rubles. At the same time, construction organizations not only failed to obtain the planned profit of 2.9 billion rubles in that year, but instead lost 2.5 billion rubles.

The value of construction projects in 1951 was lower than in 1950, and in 1952 it was lower than in 1951. However, serious shortcomings are hidden behind the overall positive indicators. Many construction organizations have not completed the state plan for reducing the cost of construction and installation projects, reducing overhead and administrative expenses, improving the organization of labor on construction sites, and making good use of machinery. For example, in 1952, in many projects in the non-ferrous metals industry, excavators were used only 44-45 percent of the time, and in petroleum industry projects, 55-60 percent. There has not yet been a resolute struggle to save raw materials and promote advanced industrial construction methods on many projects.

The reserves for saving funds by reducing losses and non-productive expenses also exist in transportation, trade, storage, and management organizations.

Eliminating these serious shortcomings in the work of various departments of the national economy and gradually implementing the thrift system can significantly increase socialist accumulation and accelerate the speed of our communist construction.

III. Methods for Implementing the Thrift System

The methods for implementing the thrift system are: systematically improving the utilization of production capacity, applying advanced technology and process engineering, improving methods of organizing labor, saving materials, raw materials, fuel, electricity, tools, and other material wealth, vigorously reducing waste production, and reducing overhead expenses in all aspects of the national economy.

The implementation of the thrift system requires tirelessly fighting to improve the productivity of social labor. The Soviet people are keenly interested in the consistent improvement of labor productivity, because this will raise their living standards and consolidate the strength of the Soviet Union. V.I. Lenin pointed out: "Communism is a higher labor productivity than capitalism, created by voluntary, conscious, and united workers using advanced technology." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 29, Page 394) The creation and mastery of new technologies, the further mechanization of production processes, especially heavy and arduous work requiring the expenditure of huge labor forces, are of decisive significance in the struggle to improve labor productivity.

In socialist society, technology serves the people. Technology saves labor for society, lightens the labor of workers, and enables labor to produce more. Every day, Soviet machine manufacturing factories create increasingly more new and improved technologies to reduce and protect human labor. The mastery of this technology itself has huge potential to increase production and implement a thrift system. The movement of rapid workers in the machine manufacturing industry and metallurgical industry can prove this.

The growth and improvement of socialist production is accompanied by the increasing savings of both living labor and materialized labor.

The Soviet state has huge internal reserves for saving material resources. Our working people are increasingly and widely carrying out socialist competition to save raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity.

However, many enterprises have not completed the state-prescribed plans for reducing product costs due to uneconomical management of their operations, resulting in the loss of large quantities of raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity. For example, the increase in the cost of goods at the Dnepropetrovsk Metallurgical Plant in 1952 was mainly due to excessive consumption of raw materials and materials (iron ore, manganese ore, limestone), and also due to losses from waste and non-productive expenses.

Significant savings reserves are contained in the improvement of production technology and the structure of machines and machinery. Many factories have mastered the production of super-strong pig iron, from which crankshafts for certain engines can be cast to replace steel shafts, while saving nearly seven tons of pig iron per shaft. Improvements in structure can also save a lot. The "Uryfelshal II" factory saved as much as one ton of ferrous metal on each set of agricultural implements for tractors by adopting tractor-suspended models.

Reducing the amount of remaining material in the machining of parts can save a considerable amount of metal. For example, when casting the front engine gate of electric motors, the parts cast by the Kaluzhsky Factory weighed 90 kilograms, while those cast by the Gorky Factory's "New Sormovo" weighed 145 kilograms, while the net weight of the parts was 60 kilograms. Thus, the metal spent in machining the same parts differed from 30 to 85 kilograms in different factories.

Improving the storage of materials can also achieve a large savings of material wealth. For example, in 1951, the Kirov Factory in Chelyabinsk lost 157,000 rubles of material wealth due to poor storage, while the "Red Sormovo" Factory lost 145,000 rubles.

Just as in agriculture, industry, construction, and transportation, there are huge possibilities for reducing labor consumption and using materials and raw materials economically. The following statistic can illustrate this point: The national machine tractor stations only need to save one percent of fuel to cultivate four million hectares of land with the fuel saved. This saving can be fully realized if losses during loading, unloading, storage, and repair are eliminated, or if machines are used very carefully.

Considerable reserves for saving fuel are contained in the further reduction of administrative expenses and the improvement of state organs.

In order to strengthen the struggle to implement the thrift system, it is necessary to strictly strengthen the supervision of the activities of enterprises by higher-level organs (various ministries and bureaus), especially financial organs and banks. In the struggle to implement the thrift system, the creative initiative of the working people and the socialist competition of the entire people to complete and overfulfill the Fifth Five-Year Plan, improve labor productivity, improve product quality, reduce costs, strive to use raw materials and electricity economically, and strive to practice the greatest possible thrift in all aspects play an extremely important role.

The struggle to implement socialist thrift and implement the strictest thrift system should be a daily concern of workers in industry and other sectors of the national economy, as well as management organs and staff of local Party, trade union and Communist Youth League organizations, and is the affair of all working people. The task of Party organizations and trade union organizations is to educate the broad masses to treat labor and public property with a socialist attitude, and to improve the creative enthusiasm of the masses in the national socialist competition. Implementing a thrift system systematically and resolutely is an important condition for achieving new achievements in economic and cultural construction, in improving the welfare of the people, and in realizing the magnificent program of communist construction.

    节约制度是国民经济进一步高涨的最重要的杠杆
    苏联克·普罗特尼可夫
    苏联人民在共产党的领导下顺利地完成着伟大的共产主义建设任务。强大的社会主义工业一往直前地行进着。作为社会主义经济主要基础的重工业的威力在一年一年地增加。轻工业与食品工业的发展已经达到高度水平，并有可能在减低物价政策的基础上日益充分地满足城乡居民不断增长的需求。我国社会主义农业也有显著的成就。
    苏联人民在经济建设和文化建设上获得了具有世界历史意义的成绩，然而在苏联人民面前仍然摆着许多没有解决的任务。
    为了实现宏伟的共产主义建设纲领，为了完成第五个五年计划，必须寻找、发现并利用国民经济内部所蕴藏的巨大的后备力量，在经济建设一切环节上实行节约制度，提高企业的赢利。
    一、社会主义社会节约制度的
          必要性
    在社会主义制度下，节约是生活的必需，是社会主义基本经济法则所决定的，是和一切劳动人民的根本利益相适应的。大家知道，社会主义生产的目的是最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。只有在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善，才能够满足这些需要。
    社会主义生产的增长是靠本国资源，靠内部积蓄泉源来实现的。经济管理得愈合理，愈节约，积蓄也将愈多，现有潜力的利用也将对社会有更大的效用。“社会用于生产食品，牲畜等物所需的时间愈少，它就愈能赢得更多的时间去从事其他生产，物质的或精神的生产。不管是个人，还是社会，其发展，其消费及其活动的全面性都是依时间的节约为转移”。（马克思恩格斯文库，第四卷，第一一九页）
    节约制度的本质就在于对待社会主义财产的爱护与主人翁的态度，就在于合理地、精打细算地使用劳力、物力与财力资源，就在于预防国民经济一切部门和一切管理环节上的损失与非生产的耗费。
    在苏维埃社会里，节省下来的资金是用来保证高速度的社会主义扩大再生产，在高度技术基础上发展工业和社会主义农业，来求得苏联人民福利一往直前的提高。由于节约政策的实现，生产活动有可能在耗费最少力量与资金的条件下获得最大的成果。
    资本主义生产方式根本就是浪费的。特别浪费的是现代的垄断资本主义，它的生产目的乃是求取最大限度的利润。当然，垄断资本家在组织生产时力求在一切方面实行节约，然而，这种“节约”带有反社会的、反人民的性质。首先，资本主义的“节约”伴随着劳动的骇人听闻的紧张化，这种“节约”的目的是反对工人，意味着日益加强对于工人和农民的剥削，残酷地对待劳动人民的生活与健康。其次，个别企业里的资本主义的“节约”伴随着流通范围中巨大的非生产的资金开支，伴随着整个资本主义生产方式的骇人听闻的浪费。
    由于生产力与生产关系的矛盾而产生的生产力发展得非常延缓，生产的无政府状态，周期性地返复的生产过剩、经济危机，经济的军国主义化，剥削阶级的寄生现象，企业经常负荷不足，产品的破坏以及现代资本主义社会经济生活中许多其他现象，都无可反驳地证明着现代资本主义的不可计量的浪费。
    与资本主义相反，社会主义生产方式为生产力的发展开辟了无限广阔的场所，排除了经济危机、企业负荷不足与失业，——在历史上第一次创造了为社会利益合理地、真正节约地管理全部经济的客观可能性。
    社会主义消灭了产生浪费现象的根源。在社会主义制度下没有剥削阶级。劳动人民自己是生产资料及其所创造的物质价值的主人。他们愿意最节约地、最勤劳地使用社会财富。社会主义社会对各经济部门间物力与劳力资源实现着有利于人民的、有计划的分配。这是大量储蓄、节约产品和不断提高社会劳动消费经济效率的重要条件。
    工业产品成本有系统的降低，可以说明社会主义国民经济发展中节约政策的重要意义和成绩。例如，一九五○年工业产品成本降低的百分之一，是四十亿卢布以上。这比第一个五年计划开始时期增大了许多倍，当时成本降低的百分之一等于一亿五千万到两亿卢布。一九五一年在降低工业品成本方面的节约所得（包括由于降低原料物资批发价格的节约）达三百五十五亿卢布。一九五二年，这种节约所得达四百六十多亿卢布。
    第十九次党代表大会的指示规定在第五个五年计划年代中，工业产品成本大约降低百分之二十五。第五个五年计划时期，在降低国民经济中生产和流通的费用方面节省的巨大资金，应当大约等于国民经济投资总额的三分之二。
    因此，我国经济管理得愈加节俭合理，在社会主义经济发展中，苏联人民在物质生活与文化生活水平的提高方面也将获得更大的成就。
    二、节约制度是社会主义的
            经营方法
    党和政府不倦地关怀着社会主义财产的巩固，作到了对于公有经济最节约的管理，领导着反对无人管理和浪费等现象，争取在生产、流通、管理方面的一切环节上逐步实现节约制度的坚决斗争。为要节约地、慎重地管理经济，必须精通经济的生产。
    为要实行严格的节约制度，我国经济工作人员必须考虑到价值法则的作用。在社会主义制度下，价值法则发生作用的范围是有限的：这一法则在我国并非社会生产的调节者。但是这个法则，正如约·维·斯大林所指出的：总还要影响到我国生产，这在领导生产时是不能不考虑到的。因此，在我们的企业中，经济核算和赢利问题、成本问题、价格问题等等，是具有现实意义的。
    价值法则对社会主义生产的影响在现今条件下是正面的因素，因为它教育经济工作人员合理地进行生产，教导他们计算生产量，寻求和利用潜在的后备力量，而不去践踏它们，教导他们改进生产方法，降低生产成本，实现经济核算，并使企业能够赢利。
    实行节约制度的最重要的杠杆是作为有计划地管理社会主义企业的方法的经济核算制。经济核算制的依据是企业实际经营的独立性，企业在经济上负责最有效地利用，生产能力最适当地开支物力与财力。
    应当指出：节约制度，这一重要的社会主义管理方法，还未被许多经济组织的领导者所充分运用，以致使社会主义经济遭受了巨大的损失。许多经济工作人员没有掌握经济的生产。在许多企业里仍然只是在形式上实行经济核算。有些经济领导人员损害整个国家的利益，故意在生产成本计划中用提高原料消耗与产品劳动量标准的方法来创造“后备力量”。这样的情况并不稀少，一些企业的低劣工作被另一些企业的良好工作所掩盖，而政府各部却满足于整个部门的平均指标，不采取应有的措施使落后企业达到先进企业的水平。
      生产过程不平衡，突击，时作时辍地工作，违反正常的生产节奏等缺点，使国民经济遭到了巨大的损害。在月初，许多企业工作很松散，然而到了月终整个生产机构感到急剧的负荷过重，这就引起了正常生产进程的破坏，生产能力利用不足，在月初损失工作时间，在月终开支大量资金，进行不必要的规定时间以外的工作，使废品增加，原料、燃料和电力消费过多，归根到底是引起了生产成本的提高。
    例如，一九五一年苏联工业企业的损耗与非生产支出达四十九亿卢布，其中属于废品损失者达三十亿卢布，这一事实证明了工业工作中有严重的缺点，同时也证明了增加经济内部积累是有巨大的后备力量的。
    我国建筑工程的规模在不断地增长。但是，正如第十九次党代表大会所指出的，在建筑工作中节约制度实行得特别不好。例如，一九五一年建筑工作中超支杂费在十亿卢布以上，同时建筑组织在这一年不但未取得计划所预定的二十九亿卢布利润，反而赔本二十五亿卢布。
    一九五一年建筑工程的价值较一九五○年低，而一九五二年又较一九五一年低。然而在总的正面的指标之后却掩盖着严重的缺点。许多建筑组织都没有完成降低建筑工程与装置工程的成本、精减杂费与行政管理费用的国家计划，没有改善建筑工地的劳动组织，没有好好地使用机器。例如，一九五二年在有色金属工业部门的许多工程中，掘土机仅运用了百分之四十四——四十五，在石油工业工程则为百分之五十五——六十。在许多工程上还没有展开节约原料、推广先进的工业建筑方法的坚决斗争。
    靠减少损耗与非生产费用来节约资金的后备力量，在运输、贸易、储藏机构与管理机构中同样存在。
    消灭国民经济各部门工作中的这些严重缺点，逐步实现节约制度才有可能显著地增大社会主义积蓄，加速我国共产主义建设的速度。
    三、实行节约制度的方法
    实行节约制度的方法是：系统地改善生产能力的利用，运用先进技术和工艺学，改善组织劳动的方法，节约材料、原料、燃料、电力、工具与其他物质财富，大力降低废品产量，减少国民经济一切环节中的杂费。
    节约制度的实行要求不倦地进行争取提高社会劳动生产率的斗争。苏联人民对劳动生产率的一贯提高感到切身的兴趣，因为这会提高他们的生活水平，巩固苏联威力。弗·伊·列宁指出：“共产主义就是利用先进技术的那些自愿、自觉、联合着的工人所创造出来较资本主义更高的劳动生产率。”
  （列宁全集，第二十九卷，第三九四页）新技术的创造和掌握，生产过程，首先是繁重的与费力的，需要支付巨大劳动力的工作的进一步机械化，在争取提高劳动生产率的斗争中具有决定性的意义。
    在社会主义社会里，技术是为人民服务的。技术为社会节省劳动，减轻工人的劳动，使劳动能生产更多的东西。每天苏联的机器制造厂都创造出日益增多的、新的、完善的技术以减轻并保护人力劳动。这种技术的掌握本身就具有提高生产，实行节约制度的巨大可能性。机器制造业，冶金工业中的快速工作者的运动可以证明这一点。
    社会主义生产的增长与改善伴随着活的劳动与物化劳动的日益增加的节约。
    苏维埃国家有节省物质资源的巨大的内部后备力量。我国劳动人民日益广泛地开展社会主义竞赛来争取节省原料、材料、燃料与电力。
    然而，许多企业由于不经济地管理事业，损失了大批原料、材料、燃料和电力，以致没有完成国家所规定的降低产品成本的计划。例如，一九五二年德聂普罗彼特洛夫斯基金属冶炼工厂商品成本的提高主要是因为原料与材料（铁矿、锰矿、石灰矿）消耗过多，也由于废品与非生产开支的损失。
    生产技术和机器与机械结构的改善，含有大量的节约后备力量。有许多工厂掌握了超等牢固的生铁的生产，从这种生铁可以铸成某些发动机上的曲柄轴，来代替钢轴，同时每柄轴可以节约生铁将近七吨。结构的改善同样也会大量节约。“乌里费沙尔第二”工厂由于采用了拖拉机吊挂式，在拖拉机的每一套农业工具上节约黑色金属达一吨之多。
    用在零件的机械加工上减少余量的方法可以节省相当多的金属。例如，铸造电力发动机的前部机关闸时，卡露兹斯基工厂所铸零件重九十公斤，高尔基工厂的“新梭尔莫发”重一百四十五公斤，其零件净重为六十公斤。这样，同样的零件在不同的工厂进行机械加工时所费的金属相差竟从三十到八十五公斤。
    改善物资保管也可以达到物质财富的大量节省。例如，一九五一年在齐良宾斯克的基洛夫工厂由于保管不善，物质财富损失十五万七千卢布，而在“红色梭尔莫发”工厂则为十四万五千卢布。
    在农业、工业、建筑业与运输业中一样具有缩减劳动消耗，节约地使用材料与原料的巨大可能性。有这样一个统计数字可以说明这点：全国机器拖拉机站仅须节省百分之一的燃料，即可用这些节约的燃料耕种四百万公顷土地。假如消灭了装卸、保管、修理时的损失，或者是在使用机器过程中很仔细，那么，这种节约是完全可以实现的。
    颇大的节约燃料的后备力量蕴藏在行政管理费用的进一步削减和国家机构的改善中。
    为要加强实行节约制度的斗争，必须严格地加强上级机关（各个部、局），特别是财政机关与银行对于企业活动的监督。在争取实行节约制度的斗争中，劳动人民的创造性的主动精神以及全体人民争取完成与超额完成第五个五年计划，提高劳动生产率，改善产品质量，降低成本，争取节约地使用原料、电力，争取在一切方面最大限度地厉行节约的社会主义竞赛起着极其重要的作用。
    争取实行社会主义节约，实行最严格的节约制度的斗争，应该是工业以及国民经济其他各部门工作者以及管理机关，各地党、工会和共产主义青年团组织的工作人员日常所关怀的事情，是全体劳动人民的事情。党组织和工会组织的任务就在于教育广大群众用社会主义态度对待劳动与公共财产，提高群众在全民社会主义竞赛中的创造积极性。有步骤地、坚决地实行节约制度是在经济建设与文化建设中，在提高人民福利，实现宏伟的共产主义建设纲领方面获得新成就的重要条件。
