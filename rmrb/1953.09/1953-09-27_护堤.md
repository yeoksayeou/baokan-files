Protecting the Dike
    Jiang Cheng
Around 11 PM on the night of August 8th. The sky was dark and heavy. Torrential rain poured down, and thunder roared. Amidst the thunder and rain, the Xiaoling River near Zijin Mountain in the Eighth District of Jin County suddenly rose by 3.5 meters. It looked like the flood was about to overflow the sluice gates and inundate the dikes.

Four years ago, in the summer, the Xiaoling River breached its dikes here. The Eighth District and dozens of miles of the coastal area became a vast ocean. The flood submerged villages and fertile fields, and washed away the people's property, leaving only treetops and rooftops visible above the water. Recently, it had been raining heavily every day for over ten days, and all the rivers were full. Mountain torrents poured into the Xiaoling River, suddenly turning the river, which was originally only a few meters wide, into a raging torrent over a hundred meters wide. The surging, yellow waves pounded against the dikes, and the flood continued to rise, seriously threatening the safety of the people's lives and property. If danger occurred, 15,000 to 16,000 hectares of land and over thirty villages downstream would be flooded, causing significant damage to more than 40,000 villagers. Not only the Eighth District but also other districts would suffer great losses.

The villagers were alarmed. In the middle of the night, gongs, horns, and shouts rang out in the villages. Village propagandists stood on rooftops and shouted through megaphones: "Villagers, get up quickly! The river is rising, hurry to the dikes..."

Wang, the deputy company commander of a People's Liberation Army unit stationed in the village, had just gone to bed when he heard people shouting about the flood. He knew that protecting the people's interests was crucial at this critical moment. He immediately got up, ordered the entire company to assemble urgently, and rush to protect the dikes from the flood. The soldiers had also heard the noise and had already gotten up, busily organizing their tools, waiting to depart. They were all worried that if the river breached its banks, the peaceful and happy lives of the villagers would be immediately disrupted; the plump sorghum, the golden millet, the fruits of the farmers' year-long hard work would all be submerged. This was an important opportunity to protect the farmers' harvest and the nation's wealth. Upon hearing the company commander's order, the soldiers rushed to participate in the flood prevention and dike protection work. The rain was falling heavily in the dark night. The villages were full of water everywhere. The road that cars usually drove on had become a knee-deep river. In the middle of this "river," the soldiers rolled up their trousers, braved the heavy rain, and ran forward as if in a race, eager to reach the dike in one step.

When they arrived at the dike, a group of villagers had already gathered there to fight the flood. Comrade Meng, the secretary of the Eighth District Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Comrade Hu, the secretary of the Zijin Village Party Branch, were leading everyone to transport soil to reinforce the dike. There were few people and the dike was large, and the soil digging area was far from the dike, so not much soil was being transported each time. The surging river was rising too rapidly, and it looked like it was only an inch or two away from the top of the gate; the flood was about to overflow.

At this critical moment, the troops arrived in the rain. Cheers immediately rang out on the dike. Hao, an old man from Zijin Village, said with emotion: "The People's Liberation Army is the best! Whenever the people are in trouble, they come to help." Comrade Meng, the District Party Secretary, excitedly shouted to the villagers: "The People's Liberation Army comrades have braved the rain to help the people protect the dike. Let's learn from them. Work harder! With the People's Liberation Army, we will definitely overcome the flood."

The soldiers immediately threw themselves into the intense battle as if they were on the battlefield. Deputy Company Commander Wang directed the operations, with some digging soil, some carrying soil, and some reinforcing the dike. Everyone worked vigorously. They used large shovels to dig soil, large baskets to carry soil, and ran while transporting soil, making a trip in no time, working quickly and fiercely. Soldier Ao Zuxiang saw an old man carrying a load of soil, struggling to send it to the dike. He took it over and said, "Old man, you're tired, let me do it!" He picked up the soil baskets and ran quickly onto the dike. Deputy Company Commander Wang picked up two full baskets of soil and was about to send them to the dike when he was spotted by soldier Fan Tongwen, who shouted: "Let's compete with the company commander! See who carries the most and runs the fastest!" He stomped on the already full soil basket a few times, added a few more shovels of soil, and ran to catch up. Soldiers Huang Qiang, Xiao Hebin... also took over the old men's soil baskets, letting them do lighter work such as shoveling soil and filling sandbags, while they took on the more strenuous task of carrying soil. Some soldiers who couldn't get soil baskets used their own clothes and large tarpaulins to carry soil to the dike.

The troops' enthusiasm for rescue also moved the villagers. Some strong young men competed with the People's Liberation Army comrades. Farmers Diao Chongshan and Luo Zhend also carried large soil bags each time. Some People's Liberation Army comrades tried to grab their soil baskets, but they resolutely refused to give them up. The dike and the area below the dike were filled with voices and shouts.

An old man said to a soldier as if he were instructing his own child, "Comrade, carry less! Be careful not to hurt your back!"
   "It's okay!" the soldier replied cheerfully, and briskly carried the soil baskets away.

At this time, the rain was still falling. The soldiers were soaked to the bone. In the dark night of Northeast China in August, the cold wind blew, and even the old men wearing straw raincoats were shivering from the cold, but the soldiers were sweating profusely, and some even took off their clothes. The dike was high and the road was narrow, and nothing could be seen in the darkness. The soldiers lined up, with the people in the back watching the backs of the people in front of them, walking one after another. If they were not careful, they would fall into the surging rapids. In the darkness, some soldiers slipped off the dike, some bumped into each other, and some lost their shoes, but the soldiers ignored these difficulties and continued to work tenaciously on the dike. Seeing this situation, the villagers automatically brought their lights, and the old people and women held up candles, illuminating a bright path from the top of the dike to the bottom. Fearing that the soldiers would accidentally fall into the river, Li Ruiqing, the director of the village women's association, led the women in the village to stand in a long line on the riverbank, using flashlights to light the way for the soldiers and urging them to walk closer to the inside. Young girls Li Shuwen and Gu Xiuyuan saw the soldiers' clothes placed in the rain, and fearing that the clothes would get wet, they ran over and took off their own straw raincoats to cover the soldiers' clothes. The people's love for the soldiers like their own children also encouraged the soldiers. They worked even harder, the shovels flying up and down, the soil baskets being quickly transported on the dike. The dike gradually became higher and thicker. In a short time, the earthen dike had been raised by more than a foot. Human power surpassed the flood.

The rain was still falling, but it was much lighter than before. The dike was consolidated, and the surging flood was blocked.

The Xiaoling River water was gurgling, but the water level had receded. Experienced old people said, "Now we're not afraid anymore. Rising water makes noise, falling water makes noise. The sound of water means it's falling." Sure enough, soon the flood stopped rising and began to recede. Standing on the solid dike above the water, people happily watched the water gradually receding, as pleased as seeing the enemy defeated. The hard work in the middle of the night finally defeated the flood. People were indescribably grateful to their soldiers. Wang Shourren, a representative of the people of Zijin Village, said: "When the grain ripens this autumn, our village will send the troops the most beautiful red flag, to forever commemorate the People's Liberation Army comrades' contribution to defeating the flood and protecting the dike!" The villagers spoke endless words of gratitude and reluctantly sent the troops far to the big bridge. Before parting, they repeatedly told the soldiers to be careful on the road and not to catch a cold.

    护堤
    江城
    八月八日深夜十一点左右。天空黑沉沉的。暴雨哗哗下着，巨雷隆隆响。雷雨声里，锦县八区紫荆山下小凌河水突然上涨了三公尺五。眼看洪水就要越过水闸门，漫过堤岸了。
    四年前的夏天，小凌河水曾在这里冲破了堤岸。八区直到海滨数十里方圆的地区成了一片汪洋大海。洪水淹没了村庄、良田，冲走了人民的财产，这里只剩下树梢和屋顶露在水面上。最近，这十多天来天天下大雨，各条河流都涨满了水，山洪滚滚流入了小凌河，使原来只有几公尺宽的河，突然涨成百多公尺宽的巨流，水势汹涌。黄色的翻滚着的巨浪用力冲击着堤岸，洪水不断上涨，严重地威胁着人民生命财产的安全。如果一旦出了危险，河下游一万五、六千垧地，三十多个村庄都将被水淹没，四万多村民将受到重大的损害。不仅是八区，其他区也要受到很大的损失。
    老乡们都惊慌起来了。深夜里各村响起了一片锣声、号声和人们的喧嚷声。村里的宣传员们站在房顶上，用广播筒大声喊着：“老乡们快起来！河水上涨了，赶快上堤去呀……”
    驻在村里的人民解放军某部王副连长这时刚刚睡下，就听到外面人们叫喊涨水了，他晓得要维护人民利益，这是紧急关头。他立刻起床，命令全连紧急集合，赶快去防洪护堤。战士们也早就听到人声，并且已经起床，正在紧张地整理工具，等待出发。他们都担心着：如果河决了口，村中的那些老乡们的和平、幸福生活都立刻被破坏了；肥壮的高粱，金黄的谷子，农民们一年辛苦劳动的果实都将被水淹没。这正是保护农民丰收，保护国家财富的重要时机。一听到连长的命令，战士们一个个都争先恐后地赶去参加防洪护堤的工作。黑夜里雨下的正急。村子到处都积满了水。平时走汽车的公路，现在已经变成水深没膝的大河了。在这条“河”中央，战士们高卷起裤腿，冒着急雨，赛跑似地向前奔去，恨不得一步赶到大堤。
    他们到大堤的时候，河堤上已聚集了一部分抢险的老乡们。中共八区党委书记孟同志和紫荆村党支部书记胡同志，正在带领着大家往堤上运土培堤。人少堤大，掘土处离堤又远，每次运的土不多。汹涌的河水涨的太猛，眼看着距离闸顶只有一、两寸，大水就要漫过来了。
    正在这紧急关头，部队冒雨赶来了。堤上立刻响起了一片欢呼声。紫荆村郝老大爷感动地说：“说啥也是子弟兵好呀！老百姓啥时候有困难，他们就啥时候赶来帮助。”区委书记孟同志兴奋地对老乡喊着：“解放军同志们冒雨赶来帮助人民护堤，大家向他们学习。加劲干呀！有了解放军同志，咱们一定能战胜洪水。”
    战士们像上了战场一样，立刻投入了紧张的战斗：王副连长指挥着，有的挖土，有的担土，有的培堤，大家生龙活虎般地动起手来。他们是铲土用大铣，担土拣大筐，运土带跑步，一会儿就是一趟，干的又快又猛。战士敖祖祥看见一个老大爷担着一担土，蹒跚着往堤上送，很费劲儿，他就一把接过来说：“老大爷，您挑累了，换我来吧！”说着担起土篮就大步飞跑上堤了。王副连长担起满满的两大篮土，刚要往堤上送，就被战士樊同稳看见了，他喊着：“大家向连长比赛呀！看谁担的多，跑的快！”自己把已经装满的土筐又用力踏了几脚，再添上几铲土，飞跑地撵上去了。战士黄强、肖河滨……也都纷纷接过来那些老大爷的土篮，让他们只作些像铲土、装土草包等较轻的工作，自己来干比较吃力的担土工作。有的战士抢不到土篮，就用自己的衣服，用大雨布抬着土往堤上运。
    部队的抢救热情，也激动着老乡们。一些年青力壮的小伙子和解放军同志比赛着干。农民刁重山、罗振德也都是每次扛一个大土草包。有的解放军同志去抢他们的土篮，他们坚决不给。堤上、堤下是一片人声和呼叫声。
    一位老大爷像嘱咐自己的孩子一样对一个战士说：“同志，少担些吧！小心把腰压坏了！”
   “不要紧！”那个战士愉快地回答着，又轻快地担起土篮走了。
    这时，雨还在下着。战士们全身已被雨浇透了。东北八月的深夜里，寒风吹来，穿着蓑衣的老大爷都冻的发抖，战士们却干的满头大汗，有的还脱了衣服。堤又高，路又窄，黑暗里什么也看不见，战士们排成一行，后面的人看着前面的人的背影，一个跟一个地走，一不小心就会掉在汹涌的急流里。在黑暗中，有的战士从堤上滑下去了，有的碰在一起了，有的鞋子陷掉了，但战士们不管这些困难，依旧顽强地在堤上工作。老乡们看到这情形，就自动地把灯都拿来，老人们、妇女们都高举着灯烛，从堤上到堤下，照出一条明亮的道路。因为怕战士失足掉在河里，村妇女主任李瑞清就带领着村中的妇女在河岸上站成了长长的行列，用手电为战士照路，并关切地招呼战士们靠里边走。年青的姑娘李淑文、顾秀媛看见战士的衣服放在雨地里，她们怕这些衣服被雨浇湿了，就跑过去脱下自己的蓑衣，把战士的衣服盖起来。人民这种对战士们的像子弟般的热爱，也鼓舞着战士们。他们一个个干的更起劲了，铁铲上下飞舞着，土篮在堤上迅速地运送着，大堤逐渐加高，加厚，不一刻土堤已经增高了一尺多。人力赛过洪水了。
    雨还在下着，但比以前小多了。大堤巩固了，汹涌的洪水被挡住了。
    小凌河水声哗哗地响着，但水势已经退了。有经验的老年人说：“现在不怕了，涨水不响落水响，水响就是落了。”果然，不久洪水就停止了涨势，开始下退了。站在高出水面的坚固的大堤上，人们欢乐地看着水势逐渐减退，就像看到敌人溃败一样愉快。半夜的辛勤劳动终于战胜了洪水。人们用说不出的热情感激自己的战士。紫荆村人民代表王守仁说：“等今年秋收籽粒成熟的时候，咱村送部队一面最漂亮的红旗，永远纪念着解放军同志战胜洪水、保护河堤的功劳！”老乡们一面说着说不完的感激话，一面恋恋不舍地把队伍送到很远的大桥下，临分别时还再三嘱咐战士路上小心，别受了凉。
