State-Owned Commercial Systems in Major Cities of Northeast China
Universally Launch Production Increase and Economy Drive Competitions

    State-owned commercial systems in major cities of Northeast China have universally launched production increase and economy drive competitions, actively expanding purchases and sales to ensure supply. The Commercial Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee convened a meeting of party branch secretaries and general branch secretaries of the state-owned commercial system on September 5, requiring each party general branch and party branch to exert the guaranteeing and supervisory role of the Party, immediately adopt effective measures to ensure the overfulfillment of the state plan. In order to guarantee the overfulfillment of the state plan for the third quarter, it was decided: First, earnestly investigate and study market needs and production and sales conditions, and expand varieties and specifications. For example, department stores should actively organize sources of goods for knitwear, clothing, shoes, and hats. Second, analyze inventory, fully display commodities, and strengthen ties with cooperatives, factories, and mines to actively expand sales. Inventory analysis must be done by categorizing specific commodities, and marketable, modifiable, price-adjustable, and exchangeable commodities should be resolved quickly and displayed completely. Third, strengthen political work and deeply develop production increase and economy drive competitions. First, check patriotic pacts and guarantee conditions. Then, earnestly and specifically put forward requirements for revision, and mobilize departmental competitions. Second, go deep into the grassroots, use detailed accounting methods to give the masses a clear understanding, so as to give play to their enthusiasm and increase their confidence in completing the plan. The state-owned commercial system in Changchun responded to the call of the municipal party committee and convened a conference of cadres above the section level and store managers of various companies on September 19, mobilizing them to launch a labor competition to expand sales. Lan Yongcheng, director of the Changchun Municipal People's Government Commercial Bureau, pointed out the shortcomings in the work of state-owned commercial departments from January to August this year at the meeting, and then put forward the goal of launching a sales competition in the next four months to overfulfill the annual commodity circulation plan by 4.1 percent, reduce circulation costs by 8.5 percent in the fourth quarter, and increase profits to be turned over to the state and open up tax sources. At the same time, he emphasized the need to implement policies and have a comprehensive view, preventing possible "single-handed" and localist tendencies. Zhang Mao, deputy minister of the Commercial Department of the CPC Changchun Municipal Committee, proposed that leaders of each unit must thoroughly lead the competition; all employees should be mobilized to discuss the plan; and party branches should call on every party member to take the lead. At the same time, a regular inspection system should be implemented, and reward work should be done well. Various professional companies in the state-owned commercial system of Dalian universally launched production increase and economy drive competitions. Before the competition, the Dalian Municipal People's Government Commercial Bureau, various professional companies, and various wholesale and retail stores successively held mobilization meetings, summarized and checked the work in July and August, and determined the content of this competition according to the specific situation. In order to ensure supply, the Dalian Company of China Chemical Raw Materials Corporation, in addition to actively organizing sources of goods from other places and studying substitute commodities, also plans to entrust local state-owned and private factories to process more than 40 kinds of commodities. In order to ensure that large quantities of goods purchased from other places are delivered in a timely manner, the Dalian Company of China Hardware and Machinery Corporation has sent people to other places to check and organize transportation. Sales staff of the knitwear group of the Dalian Department Store Wholesale Store took the initiative to go to the wholesale station to look at samples and found that many commodities had not been delivered to the sales area, so they ensured that they were delivered to the sales area in a timely manner to increase the variety of commodities. The storage and transportation department of the Dalian Department Store Wholesale Station is currently paying attention to careful calculation in transportation. Recently, when transporting a batch of sugar from inside the customs, it changed from land transportation to sea transportation, saving the state 110 million yuan. Employees of the oil and fat store of the Dalian Company of China Coal Industry Building Materials Corporation actively tapped potential in discussing the production increase and economy drive plan, so that the sales plan was increased by 1.5 billion yuan on the basis of the original plan increase of 33.4 percent. The CPC Qiqihar Municipal Committee convened a meeting of party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres of the city's state-owned commercial, grain, and cooperative systems on September 12, mobilizing them to quickly launch a production increase and economy drive movement. Zhang Lin, deputy mayor of Qiqihar, pointed out: First, it is necessary to actively expand the scope of sales, strengthen wholesale work, to carry out wholesale business, do a good job in market research, ensure market supply, reduce commodity circulation costs, vigorously promote advanced experience, and promote competition with political work. Second, it is necessary to tighten expenditures, reduce administrative management personnel to enrich business personnel. Third, strengthen the responsibility system and patriotic education, strengthen labor discipline education, establish a reward system, and oppose corruption and waste. Finally, specific requirements were put forward for the state-owned commercial and cooperative system to increase production and save money in the next three and a half months to increase production and save 7.20842 billion yuan.
    In addition, after the China Department Store Company Harbin Company conveyed the Northeast Bureau's decision on increasing production and saving money and the instructions of the Municipal Commercial Bureau, after study and discussion, it calculated that the preliminary figure for increasing production and saving money was to overfulfill the state plan by 22 billion yuan by the end of the year, and increase profits for the country by about 1.3 billion yuan. After research, the Qiqihar Native Produce Company first plans to add a native produce freight yard to expand wholesale business. At the same time, restore native produce stores to meet market needs. Reduce personnel from various departments and stores of the company to enrich newly established units. By the end of the year, it can save the country about 1.183 billion yuan.
