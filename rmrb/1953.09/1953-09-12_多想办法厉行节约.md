    The Southwest District National Materials Reserve Bureau and other materials management departments recently cleared out more than 230,000 tons of materials, which were put into production after unified allocation. This is an effective measure for practicing thrift. This measure not only saved the country a huge expenditure, but also turned the "waste materials" scattered everywhere, forgotten by people, and being damaged by wind and rain, into a force for producing and creating wealth for the country. The Chongqing 101 Factory, with the help of Soviet experts, processed and repaired the "scrap steel" that had been piled up in the open mud for more than ten years, and it has become the largest horsepower machine in the Southwest District, greatly improving the factory's steel rolling capacity. Guizhou, Yunnan and other places used old machines, oil pipes, rubber boats, medicines and other materials accumulated in warehouses, some of which supported the country's key construction projects, some supported the troops liberating Tibet, and some supplied the needs of the market. These are the most vivid examples, worthy of everyone's emulation.
    Practicing thrift is an extremely important policy in our national construction. Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us to practice thrift vigorously in many of his works in various periods. The experience of the Soviet Union should especially be used for our reference. The resolution of the 15th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union once emphasized the great significance of implementing thrift: "It is impossible to realize the industrialization of the country without resolutely and unswervingly implementing the thrift system." Comrade Stalin said when summarizing the first five-year plan of the Soviet Union: "The way to achieve the goal of restoring heavy industry and realizing the five-year plan is to stipulate extremely strict saving methods and accumulate the funds necessary to subsidize our industrialization."
    In the past few years, although we have also carried out thrift campaigns in the process of economic recovery, and have carried out several large-scale material clearing activities in various places, clearing out a large amount of valuable materials. However, we cannot conclude that there is nothing more to clear out just because we have carried out several clearing activities. That's not true. We must know that not only have some areas not cleared out old warehouse materials, but also new stagnant materials have been produced. With the development of the country's construction undertakings, various economic departments and enterprises have added a large number of equipment and materials, and we still lack experience in enterprise management, and various systems are not reasonable enough, so that some of the purchased equipment is not suitable for the needs of the enterprise, or the quantity exceeds the needs, or because of production changes, the original equipment and materials are no longer applicable, and new backlogs have been added to the warehouse. Therefore, regularly and frequently clearing one's own warehouses and materials, and finding out the family property, has become an important task that should be often emphasized by all economic organs, especially materials management departments.
    Let us learn from the experience of the Southwest District in clearing and uniformly allocating 230,000 tons of materials, grasp the different universal waste phenomena in various places, overcome them, and turn the slogan of practicing thrift vigorously into powerful actions.

### 多想办法厉行节约

    多想办法厉行节约
    西南区国家物资储备局等物资管理部门，最近清查出二十三万多吨物资，经过统一调配，投入生产，这是厉行节约的一种有效措施。这一措施，不仅为国家节省了一笔巨大的开支，并且把四散各处的、被人遗忘了的、正在被风吹雨淋损坏着的“废物”，变成了为国家生产财富、创造财富的力量。重庆一零一厂把堆在露天烂泥里十多年的“废钢铁”，经过苏联专家帮助加工整修后，已经变成了西南区一部最大的马力机，大大地提高了该厂的轧钢能力。贵州、云南等地利用积压在仓库里的旧机器、油管、橡皮船、药品等物资，有的支援了国家的重点建设，有的支援了解放西藏的部队，有的供应了市场的需要。这些都是最生动的例子，值得大家效法的。
    节约是我们在国家建设中一项极其重要的政策。毛主席在各个时期的许多著作中，都一再教导我们要厉行节约。苏联的经验尤其应该做我们的借鉴。苏联共产党第十五次代表会议决议中，曾经强调指出实行节约的重大意义：“如果不坚决地坚定不移地实行节约制度，要实现国家工业化是不可能的”。斯大林同志在总结苏联第一个五年计划时说：“规定极严格节省的办法，积蓄为资助我国工业化所必需的经费——这就是我们为达到恢复重工业和实现五年计划目的所应走的道路。”
    几年来，我国在经济恢复过程中虽然也进行过节约运动，并在各地进行过几次大规模的清查物资，清查出来了大量的宝贵物资。但是，不能因为我们已经进行过几次清理工作，就得出结论说：再没有什么可清查的了。不是的。我们要知道，不仅有些地区旧的仓库物资还没有查清，并且还产生了新的呆滞物资。随着国家建设事业的发展，各经济部门、各企业单位都添置了大批的器材和设备，而我们在企业管理上还缺乏经验，各种制度还不够合理，以致有些购置的器材不适合本企业的需要，或者数量超过了需要，或者因生产变更，原来的设备、器材已不适用，仓库里又增添了新的积压。因此，定期地、经常地清查自己的仓库和物资，摸清家底，就成为各经济机关、特别是物资管理部门应该经常重视的一项重要工作。
    让我们从西南区清理和统一调配二十三万吨物资的事件中吸取经验，抓住各地不同的带有普遍性的浪费现象，加以克服，把厉行节约的口号变成有力的行动吧。
