    Production and Consumption Under the Socialist System
    USSR, Aositeluoweiqiangnuofu
    The Communist Party and the Soviet government have put forward the task of making our country produce abundant consumer goods and further and rapidly improving the material living standards of the Soviet people in the next two to three years. To accomplish this task, it is necessary to ensure a rapid increase in the production of daily consumer goods.
    The possibility of a rapid increase in the production of consumer goods is prepared by the entire previous development of socialist industry and arises from the essence of the socialist mode of production.
    The Soviet state strengthens the production of consumer goods based on socialist economic laws and Marxist-Leninist theory on production and consumption.

    I. Marxist-Leninist Theory on Production and Consumption

    The production of material wealth is the basis for the survival and development of all societies and for satisfying people's needs.
    If production is the starting point of the movement of social products, then consumption is the end point and completion of this movement. At the same time, according to Marx, consumption in turn affects the starting point and re-establishes the foundation of the entire process. "Without production, there is no consumption, but without consumption, there is no production, because in the latter case, production loses its purpose."
  (Marx: Critique of Political Economy, 1949 Russian Edition, page 202.)
    Economic science distinguishes between the consumption of production and personal consumption. The consumption of production is the use of means of production – tools of labor, raw materials, materials – in the labor process, which directly belongs to the production process itself. When talking about consumption as the purpose of production, it refers to the personal consumption of various products necessary for people to meet their material and cultural needs.
    Every mode of production has its own laws, which determine the comparative relationship between production and consumption.
    As is well known, the purpose and driving force of capitalist production is to obtain maximum profit. This purpose is achieved by exploiting the working class and all working people, enslaving and plundering the people of other countries, especially the people of colonies, and by means of wars and militarization of the national economy. This is the basic economic law of modern capitalism, which determines the special interrelationship between production and consumption in bourgeois society.
    Under capitalism, the consumption of the working people is a subordinate factor of production, just as machines need lubricating oil. Capitalists only meet the needs of the working people to the extent that it is absolutely necessary to obtain profits.
    The capitalists' attempt to pursue maximum profits is in antagonistic contradiction with the consumption of the masses. This contradiction reflects the basic contradiction of the capitalist system, namely the contradiction between the social nature of production and the private capitalist form of ownership of labor products. In order to pursue maximum profits, capitalists strive to expand production endlessly on the one hand, and on the other hand, they limit the consumption of the working people to the minimum, making them increasingly impoverished. This causes the separation of production and consumption. However, no production can develop independently of consumption. Capitalist production is periodically limited by the narrow purchasing power of the masses, which inevitably leads to economic crises of overproduction.
    The monopoly capital that dominates modern capitalist countries is trying its best to remedy the low purchasing power of the working masses for commodities. They open up markets for capitalist production through economic militarization. However, this leads to a further reduction in the consumption of the masses and further deepens the antagonistic contradiction between production and consumption. Now, the imperialist countries, especially the United States, are struggling desperately in this predicament, vainly trying to consolidate their economies by militarizing the national economy.
    In a socialist society that has eliminated private ownership of the means of production and the exploitation of man by man, the antagonism between production and consumption no longer exists. The purpose of socialist production is not profit, but to maximize the satisfaction of the ever-growing needs of the entire society. This purpose is achieved by continuously increasing and perfecting production on a highly technical basis. This is the basic economic law of socialism, which determines the establishment of a new relationship between production and consumption that is contrary to capitalism.
    Under the socialist system, production directly serves the consumption of the people. The satisfaction of the ever-growing needs of the masses is determined by the level of production development and the available resources. The continuous growth of socialist production establishes a solid foundation for improving the material welfare of the working people and increasing people's consumption.
    The continuous rise in people's consumption and the needs of the working people is a necessary condition for continuously expanding production on a highly technical basis. The growth of the people's material welfare, the increase in the purchasing power of workers, staff, and peasants for daily necessities creates an ever-expanding market for commodities produced by industry and agriculture. On the other hand, the continuous growth of production also places more demands on the means of production. In socialist society, the growth of people's consumption consistently precedes the level of production, becoming a powerful factor in promoting the development of production. This is the non-antagonistic contradiction between production and consumption unique to socialism, which can be resolved by continuously increasing production on a highly technical basis.
    Socialist production, which moves forward on the basis of the law of planned development, does not have the difficulties in selling products peculiar to the capitalist system. Socialist production creates the necessary and possible conditions for the planned and continuous expansion of production and for the steady improvement of the people's consumption level, and the improvement of the people's consumption level in turn has a huge impact on the further upsurge of production.
    The link connecting production and consumption is the distribution of material resources between people. How the produced consumer goods are distributed depends on who owns the means of production. If the means of production are publicly owned by society, then the distribution of consumer goods will benefit the working people; if the means of production are owned by the exploiting class, then the distribution of consumer goods will be used to enrich the exploiters.
    Distribution determines the share of national income that each member of society occupies, according to the economic laws of a certain social form. Under capitalism, the distribution of national income favors the owners of the means of production, namely the capitalists. Only a small portion of the national income goes to workers in the form of wages, and this amount of wages is reduced by taxes levied by the bourgeois state. Peasants and handicraftsmen have to hand over most of their income to landlords, merchants, bankers, and the bourgeois state.
    In socialist society, all national income belongs to the laborers and is used in a way that is consistent with the interests of the laborers. Three-quarters of the national income of the Soviet Union is used to meet the individual material and cultural needs of the laborers, and the rest is used to expand socialist production and meet other needs of the entire country and society, which ultimately also benefits the laborers.

    II. Continuous Growth of Production and Consumption Under the Socialist System

    The fulfillment of the task of maximizing the satisfaction of the constantly growing needs of the laborers is only possible under the condition that the entire social production continues to grow and the growth of the production of means of production occupies a priority position. Precisely for this reason, heavy industry must develop rapidly. Heavy industry is the main foundation of the socialist economy, the base for equipping all sectors of the national economy with the latest technology and ensuring national defense capabilities.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have achieved remarkable achievements in developing socialist industry, especially in developing heavy industry. The solid foundation needed to fully improve the technical equipment of all sectors of the national economy has been established. If, in the 1924-1925 fiscal year, the proportion of heavy industry in the total industrial output was only one-third, the same as in pre-revolutionary Russia, then by 1953, this proportion will account for more than two-thirds.
    Accompanying the establishment and rapid development of heavy industry is the upsurge of the food industry, light industry, and the agriculture of collective farms and state farms. On this basis, the welfare of the Soviet people has been continuously improved. However, the requirement to concentrate fully on the development of heavy industry has made it impossible for light industry and the food industry to develop at the same speed as the development of heavy industry, and this necessity of developing heavy industry is due to the fact that socialism was established in a country that was technologically and economically backward and surrounded by hostile capitalist countries, and the difficulties it encountered during the post-war period of national economic recovery.
    In the past 28 years, the total output of means of production in the Soviet Union has increased approximately 54 times, but the output of consumer goods has only increased 11 times. If, in 1953, the output of means of production increased more than two times compared with 1940, then, during the same period, the output of consumer goods only increased by 72 percent.
    This contrast in the development speed between heavy industry and light industry can no longer meet the needs of Soviet society today. The level of development that heavy industry has reached makes it possible to greatly accelerate the production of daily consumer goods. The economic necessity of rapidly shifting to accelerating the development of light industry, the food industry, and agriculture in order to ensure a rapid increase in the people's consumption level has matured. To realize this transformation, it is necessary to change the existing comparative relationship in the development speed between the first and second categories of social production, so that the production of consumer goods accelerates.
    Heavy industry should supply the production sectors manufacturing consumer goods with the most advanced modern machines, ensuring the widespread automation and mechanization of the consumer goods production process.
    In order to accelerate the production of consumer goods, it is necessary to greatly increase the basic investment in light industry and the food industry, and expand the production capacity of these national economic sectors. This has been stipulated in the Soviet Union's 1953 state budget passed by the current session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet.
    With the improvement of the living standards of the laborers, the content of their consumption is also changing, and the demand for higher quality products is increasing. The development of light industry and the food industry must adapt to the changes in demand. In-depth research into consumer demand and striving to improve the quality of finished products has become important.
    The measures taken by the Party and the government are to greatly expand the production of cotton fabrics, woolen fabrics, and silk fabrics, increase the output of clothes and shoes, strengthen the supply of meat, fish, sugar, butter, confectionery, tableware, and furniture to residents, and fully expand the production of cultural and daily necessities such as refrigerators, radios, televisions, bicycles, motorcycles, and automobiles.
    In 1953, the Soviet government stipulated further tasks for the production and sale of daily consumer goods. As a result of these measures, the trade network will receive 32 billion rubles more in goods this year, and this is only the first step in rapidly expanding the production of consumer goods.
    Agriculture, which supplies the people with food and industry with raw materials, plays a major role in developing light industry and the food industry and in improving the consumption of residents.
    The great achievements already made in agriculture cannot eliminate the fact that the level of agricultural production still lags behind the technical equipment of collective farms and behind the potential power of the collective farm system.
    The Soviet government has formulated a series of huge measures to resolutely develop agricultural production, especially the production of animal husbandry, vegetables, and potatoes, and to further strengthen the equipment of machine tractor stations and state farms with advanced agricultural machinery. The 1953 state budget allocated 39.9 billion rubles for this purpose.
    The most important condition for achieving the upsurge of collective farm production is to increase the economic interest of collective farmers in the results of their labor, to more thoroughly apply the socialist principle of distribution according to labor, and to fully encourage collective farmers who have achieved high production results.
    In the passed 1953 state budget, additional funds of 13.6 billion rubles were stipulated in the measures for agriculture. This fund will be used to increase the economic interest of collective farms and collective farmers in increasing crop yields and livestock productivity. The budget specifically stipulates to increase purchase and procurement prices, reduce agricultural taxes levied on residents, and so on.
    Increasing the production of material wealth, especially personal consumer goods, is one of the decisive prerequisites for maximizing the satisfaction of the ever-growing needs of the working people. But this alone is not enough. The products that have been produced must be distributed among the residents so that these products reach consumers.
    At the socialist stage, when socialist ownership still exists in two forms, the distribution of consumer goods is basically realized through trade.
    Soviet trade is different from capitalist trade, which is used by capitalists as a tool to extra-exploit the laborers. It serves the people. Soviet trade realizes the connection between producers and consumers, directly supplying consumers with commodities produced by socialist industry and agriculture, while also actively influencing socialist production. Soviet trade estimates the growth and changes in residents' needs, promotes the expansion of consumer goods production and the improvement of their quality.
    Soviet trade is the basic form of consumer goods distribution in socialist society. The laborers of socialist society realize the main part of their income through the Soviet trade system. It can be seen that maximizing the satisfaction of the constantly growing needs of the laborers depends to a large extent on the development of Soviet trade and the quality of work of trade organizations.
    The most important conditions for accelerating the development of consumer goods production and improving the welfare of the working people are to better utilize production capacity, rationally organize production, implement economic accounting systems, increase labor productivity, and reduce costs.
    With the emergence of abundant raw materials and the increase in the actual wages and income of the laborers, and with the development of commodity circulation, various prerequisites will be created in order to transition from the distribution method of distribution according to labor to the distribution method of distribution according to needs.
    × × ×
    The Communist Party and the Soviet government, guided by the economic theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and following the economic laws of socialism, are guaranteeing the further strong growth of socialist production and the vigorous development of commodity circulation, thereby further improving the consumption of residents and realizing this great goal, namely maximizing the satisfaction of the constantly growing needs of the laborers in socialist society.

    社会主义制度下的生产和消费
    苏联  奥斯特罗维强诺夫
    共产党和苏维埃政府提出了在最近两三年内使我国出产丰富的消费品，并使苏维埃人民的物质生活水平进一步急遽提高的任务。为了达成这个任务，就必须保证日用消费品生产的急遽增长。
    消费品生产急遽增长的可能性，是由在这以前社会主义工业的全部发展所准备好了的，是由社会主义生产方式的本质所产生的。
    苏维埃国家加强消费品的生产，是以社会主义的经济法则和马克思列宁主义关于生产和消费的学说为依据的。
    一、马克思列宁主义论生产和消费
    物质财富的生产是一切社会的生存和发展以及人们的需要赖以满足的基础。
    如果说生产是社会产品运动的起点，那么消费便是这一运动的终点和完成。同时，按照马克思的说法，消费又反过来影响起点，并重新奠定整个过程的基础。“没有生产便没有消费，但是没有消费也不会有生产，因为在后一情况下生产便失掉了目的。”
  （马克思：政治经济学批判，一九四九年俄文版，第二○二页。）
    经济科学把生产的消费和个人的消费区别开来。生产的消费，是生产资料——劳动工具、原料、材料——在劳动过程中的使用，它直接属于生产过程本身。当作为生产的目的而谈到消费的时候，所指的就是人们为满足其物质和文化需要所必需的各种产品的个人消费。
    每一种生产方式都有它自己的法则，这些法则决定着生产和消费之间的对比关系。
    如所周知，资本主义生产的目的和动力就是获得最大限度的利润。这个目的是用剥削工人阶级和全体劳动人民，奴役和掠夺其他国家人民、特别是殖民地人民的办法，用战争和国民经济军事化的办法来达到的。这就是现代资本主义的基本经济法则，它决定着资产阶级社会中生产和消费之间的特殊的相互关系。
    在资本主义条件下，劳动人民的消费正如同机器需要润滑油一样，是生产的一个从属因素。资本家们只是在获得利润所绝对必需的限度内，才来满足劳动人民的需要。
    资本家追求最大限度利润的这种企图，是和人民群众的消费有着对抗性的矛盾的。这个矛盾反映着资本主义制度的基本矛盾，即生产的社会性和劳动产品的私人资本主义占有形式之间的矛盾。资本家为了追逐最大限度的利润，一方面力求无止境地扩大生产，而另一方面却把劳动人民的消费限制于最小限度，使他们日益贫困。这便引起生产和消费的脱节。然而，任何一种生产都不能脱离消费而单独发展。资本主义生产周期性地受到人民群众的狭小的购买力的限制，这就不可避免地要引起生产过剩的经济危机。
    在现代资本主义国家里占统治地位的垄断资本，正在竭力设法补救劳动群众对商品的购买力低落的现象。它们通过经济军事化的办法来为资本主义生产开辟市场。但是，这就引起人民群众消费的进一步降低，并使生产和消费之间的对抗性的矛盾进一步加深。现在，各帝国主义国家，首先是美国，正在这个矛盾的绝境中拚命挣扎，徒劳无益地想用国民经济军事化的办法来巩固其本国的经济。
    在消灭了生产资料私有制和人剥削人现象的社会主义社会里，生产和消费之间的对抗已不存在。社会主义生产的目的不是利润，而是最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的需要。这个目的是用在高度技术基础上使生产不断增长和不断完善的办法来达到的。这就是社会主义的基本经济法则，它决定了同资本主义相反的、新的生产和消费之间相互关系的建立。
    在社会主义制度下，生产直接为人民的消费服务。人民群众的日益增长的需要的满足，是由生产发展的水平和现有的资源来决定的。社会主义生产的不断增长，为劳动人民物质福利的提高，为人民消费的增进，建立了稳固的基础。
    人民消费和劳动人民需要的不断上升，又是在高度技术基础上不断扩大生产的必要条件。人民物质福利的增长，工人、职员和农民对日用品的购买力的提高，为工业和农业所生产的商品创造了日益扩大的市场。另一方面，生产的不断增长又对生产资料提出了更多的需求。在社会主义社会里，人民消费的增长一贯走在生产水平的前面，成为推动生产向前发展的有力因素。这就是社会主义所独有的生产和消费之间的非对抗性的矛盾，这个矛盾可以用在高度技术基础上使生产不断增长的办法予以解决。
    在有计划发展的法则的基础上向前迈进的社会主义生产，没有资本主义制度所特有的那种销售产品的困难。社会主义生产为有计划地和不断地扩大生产，以及为人民的消费水平的稳步提高创造了必要和可能的条件，而人民消费水平的提高，又反过来对生产的进一步高涨发生巨大的影响。
    联系生产和消费的环节，是人与人之间的物质资料的分配。生产出来的消费品如何进行分配，视生产资料归谁所有而定。如果生产资料为社会所公有，那末消费品的分配便会有利于劳动人民；如果生产资料归剥削阶级所有，那末消费品的分配便会被用来使剥削者发财致富。
    分配是按照一定社会形态的经济法则来决定国民收入中各社会成员所占有的份额的。在资本主义条件下，国民收入的分配有利于生产资料的占有者即资本家。国民收入中只有一小部分是以工资的形式归工人所有，而且这点工资额，还因资产阶级国家课税而被削减。农民和手工业者则不得不把自己的收入的大部分交给地主、商人、银行家和资产阶级国家。
    在社会主义社会里，全部国民收入都归劳动者所有，其用途是符合于劳动者的利益的。苏联的国民收入的四分之三是用来满足劳动者个人的物质和文化的需要，其余部分则是用来扩大社会主义生产和满足整个国家和社会的其他需要，归根结底也还是用在劳动者的利益上的。
    二、社会主义制度下生产和消费的不断增长
    最大限度地满足劳动者经常增长的需要——这一任务的完成，只有在整个社会生产不断增长而且生产资料生产的增长占优先地位的条件下，才是可能的。正因为如此，所以重工业必须迅速发展。重工业是社会主义经济的主要基础，是以最新技术来装备国民经济一切部门和保证国家防御能力的基地。
    在共产党的领导下，苏联人民在发展社会主义工业，首先是在发展重工业方面，获得了卓越的成就。全力提高国民经济一切部门的技术装备所需要的雄厚基础于是建立起来了。如果说，在一九二四—一九二五年度，还和革命前的俄国一样，工业总产量中重工业的比重仅为三分之一，那末到一九五三年，这一比重将占三分之二以上。
    伴随着重工业的建立和迅速发展而来的，是食品工业、轻工业以及集体农庄、国营农场农业的高涨。在这一基础上，苏联人民福利有了不断的提高。但是，全力集中发展重工业的要求，使轻工业和食品工业不可能用同发展重工业一样高的速度来发展，而发展重工业的这种必要性，则是由于社会主义是在一个技术和经济上落后的、并在敌对的资本主义各国包围下的国家里建立起来以及它在战后国民经济恢复时期中遇到的困难所引起的。
    在最近二十八年中，苏联的生产资料总产量大约增加了五十四倍，可是消费品的产量只增加了十一倍。如果说在一九五三年，生产资料的产量比一九四○年增加了两倍多，那末，在同一时期，消费品的产量却只增加了百分之七十二。
    重工业和轻工业发展速度间的这种对比关系，今天已不能满足苏联社会的需要，重工业已达到的发展水平，使得大大加速日用消费品的生产具有可能性。为了保证迅速提高人民的消费水平，而迅速转向加速轻工业、食品工业和农业的发展这一经济上的必要性已经成熟了。实现这一转变，需要改变社会生产第一部类和第二部类间现有的发展速度的对比关系，而使消费品生产加速增长起来。
    重工业应当以最先进的近代机器供给制造消费品的生产部门，保证消费品生产过程的广泛的自动化和机械化。
    为了加速消费品的生产起见，必须大量增加轻工业和食品工业的基本投资，扩充这些国民经济部门的生产能力。在本届苏联最高苏维埃会议所通过的苏联一九五三年国家预算法中，对此已作了规定。
    随着劳动者生活水平的提高，他们的消费内容也在发生变化，对质量更高的产品的需求正在增加。轻工业和食品工业的发展必须适应需求的改变。深入地研究消费者的需求，尽量提高成品质量，已具有重要的意义。
    党和政府所采取的措施，是要大大扩充棉织品、毛织品和丝织品的生产，增加衣服、鞋类的产量，加强对居民的肉类、鱼类、糖、牛油、糖果点心、食具、家具的供应，全力扩大冰箱、收音机、电视机、自行车、摩托车、汽车等文化和生活用品的生产。
    一九五三年，苏联政府就日用消费品的生产和出售，规定了进一步的任务。由于采取了这些措施，贸易网今年将多得到三百二十亿卢布的货物，而这不过是迅速扩大消费品生产的第一步。
    农业是用粮食供应人民，用原料供应工业的，它在发展轻工业和食品工业以及在提高居民的消费方面，起着重大的作用。
    农业方面已经取得的巨大成就，还不能消除农业生产水平仍落后于集体农庄的技术装备，仍落后于集体农庄制度所具有的潜在力量这一事实。
    苏联政府拟定了一系列的巨大措施来坚决地发展农业生产，特别是畜牧业、蔬菜和马铃薯的生产，并以先进的农业机械来进一步加强机器拖拉机站和国营农场的装备。一九五三年度的国家预算中，为此拨出了三百九十九亿卢布的资金。
    为要达到集体农庄生产的高涨，最重要的条件是提高集体农民对自己劳动成果的经济兴趣，更彻底地应用社会主义的按劳分配原则，以全力鼓励取得高度生产成绩的集体农民。
    在已通过的一九五三年度的国家预算法内，在对农业的措施方面规定了追加经费一百三十六亿卢布。这笔资金将用来提高集体农庄和集体农民对增加农作物收获量和牲畜产品率的经济兴趣。在预算法中特别规定要提高收购和采购价格，降低对居民所课征的农业税等等。
    提高物质财富、特别是个人消费品的生产，是最大限度地满足劳动人民日益增长的需要的决定性前提之一。但单只有这一个前提是不够的。必须把已生产出来的产品在居民当中进行分配，使这些产品到达消费者手中。
    在社会主义阶段上，当社会主义所有制还存着两种形式的时候，消费品的分配基本上是通过贸易来实现的。
    苏维埃贸易和被资本家用来作为额外剥削劳动者的工具的资本主义贸易不同，它是为人民服务的。苏维埃贸易实现着生产者与消费者间的联系，把社会主义工业和农业所生产的商品直接供应消费者，同时并积极地来影响社会主义生产。苏维埃贸易估计到居民需求的增长和它的变化，促进着消费品生产的扩大和它们的质量的提高。
    苏维埃贸易是社会主义社会中消费品分配的基本形式。社会主义社会的劳动者通过苏维埃贸易系统来实现其收入的主要部分。由此可见，最大限度地满足劳动者的不断增长的需要，在很大的程度内有赖于苏维埃贸易的发展和贸易机构工作的质量。
    消费品生产的加速发展和劳动人民福利的提高的最重要的条件是更好地利用生产能力，合理地组织生产，贯彻经济核算制，提高劳动生产率和降低成本。
    随着丰富的生产品的出现和劳动者的实际工资和收入的提高，随着商品流转的开展，便将创造出种种前提，以便从按劳取酬的分配方式过渡到各取所需的分配方式。
    ×　×　×
    共产党和苏联政府以马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的经济理论为指南，遵循着社会主义的经济法则，正在保证社会主义生产的进一步强有力的增长和商品流转的大力展开，借以进一步提高居民的消费，并实现这一伟大的目的，即最大限度地满足社会主义社会劳动者不断增长的需要。
