Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 28th: Sixty-five Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were repatriated yesterday further exposed the criminal activities of US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents plotting to murder and kidnap explanation representatives from our side and neutral nations personnel. Li Jinquan, one of those who returned, pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent chief, Fang Zhi, personally arranged, with the assistance of the US military authorities, for Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents to impersonate prisoners of war and infiltrate the neutral nations' custodial camps.

Li Jinquan, who had served in an administrative position in the POW camp, personally heard Fang Zhi say at a meeting of secret agents and administrative personnel in the POW camp held at the US military police headquarters on Jeju Island on August 26th: "We have decided to send dozens of people from Taiwan to join you in the neutral nations custodial camps. More than a dozen of them will act as prisoners of war, and the rest will act as representatives or reporters of the United Nations forces." On September 7th, indeed, twenty or thirty Chiang Kai-shek secret agents from Taiwan wearing US military uniforms arrived, led by a man named Ge Tianmin. Zhang Tian, another returnee, personally saw a Chiang Kai-shek secret agent from Taiwan surnamed Li, wearing newly marked "PW" (prisoner of war) clothes, enter the neutral nations custodial camp.

On September 15th, the secret agent Ge Tianmin said in Li Jinquan's tent: "We must organize strong and powerful people into kidnapping groups. When the Communist explanation representatives are walking or going to the toilet, drag them into the tent and stuff their mouths with towels. At this time, we can call the Americans to take pictures. Then we can announce to the outside world that he is seeking political asylum and does not want to return to the Communists. He doesn't want to come out to see people now; if you don't believe it, you can look at the photos."

Li Jinquan also heard the secret agent Ge Tianmin coerce the prisoners of war, saying: "You must all put a handful of bleaching powder in your pockets. When the Communist explanation representatives come, sprinkle it in their eyes." The next day, the Americans distributed more than a dozen buckets of disinfectant powder to each battalion, instructing the secret agents to bring them into the camp under the pretext of using them for washing things. The returnee Zhang Tian said that the Chiang Kai-shek secret agent from Taiwan surnamed Li that he saw had told the prisoners of war to "kill the representatives of neutral nations Poland, Czechoslovakia, and India." This secret agent also coerced the prisoners of war: "Watch my cue to act." Therefore, these sixty-five returnees repeatedly told the Chinese People's Volunteer Army officers at the Panmunjom tent yesterday: "Our explanation representatives and neutral nations representatives must be careful when they go!"

Li Jinquan also confirmed that the Chiang Kai-shek secret agents brought radios into the camp. He said: "Wang Shunqing, the regimental commander of the First Regiment and a major secret agent, has already entered the neutral nations custodial camp. They had a transceiver on Jeju Island. This time, they have disassembled the radio into parts and brought them in separately, along with three typewriters and a mimeograph machine."

These sixty-five returnees were detained separately by the US on Jeju Island because they expressed a desire to return to the country, and were prepared to be killed. Later, the US was somewhat afraid that the news would leak out and be criticized by public opinion, so they threatened them and forced them to write "guarantees to return to Taiwan" in blood to the US military police headquarters. On August 27th, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent chief, Fang Zhi, specifically sought out Li Jinquan for a "private conversation" to carry out various threats, and even shamelessly enticed them, saying: "If none of you go back, I guarantee you can become high officials in Taiwan in the future!" Fang Zhi revealed: "If one person goes back, the secrets of 14,000 people will be exposed. This is the key to the success or failure of the US in the political conference!"

After they arrived at the neutral nations custodial camp, they were detained separately in a small barbed wire enclosure, and secretly planned to break through the control of the secret agents and request repatriation from the neutral nations before the explanation work began. On September 23rd, the secret agents of the "First Regiment" "ordered" them to hold a "demonstration" against the explanation work on the 24th. They refused to accept this "order," drove away the secret agents lurking among them on the 25th, and requested repatriation from the Indian officers that night. They also rushed to make the five-star red flag of the motherland overnight.

The next morning, the secret agents in the nearby camp forced the prisoners of war to gather in front of the barbed wire, preparing to rush out and hit them with stones. These sixty-five people sang loudly and shouted slogans: "Oppose US imperialism's massacre of prisoners of war and detention of prisoners of war!" "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents' slaughter of prisoners of war!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

When the Indian troops sent vehicles to pick them up from the camp at about 1:00 PM, these sixty-plus people heading towards freedom raised the bright five-star national flag on the vehicles, so that the nearby camps could see it. They sang loudly and shouted slogans, and tried their best to throw the written leaflets to their suffering brothers. They shouted: "Comrades, the time to return to the motherland has come!" At this time, the secret agents in the camp were so frightened that they quickly drove our prisoners of war into the tents, and secret agents carrying wooden sticks and flagpoles patrolled outside, forbidding our prisoners of war from coming out to watch.

    美蒋特务预谋杀害和劫持我方解释代表
    【新华社开城二十八日电】昨天被遣返的六十五名中国人民志愿军被俘人员进一步揭露了美蒋特务阴谋杀害和劫持朝中方面解释代表和中立国人员的罪恶活动。归来人员中的李金全并指出：蒋匪特务头子方治曾在美军当局协助下，亲自布置把蒋匪特务冒充战俘混入中立国看管营场。
    李金全曾在战俘营担任行政职务，八月二十六日，方治在济州岛美军宪兵司令部召集战俘营中的特务分子和行政人员开会时，他亲自听到方治说：“我们决定从台湾派几十个人来和你们一起到中立国看管营场去。他们有十多个人将充作战俘，其余将充作联合国军的代表或记者。”九月七日，果然来了二、三十个穿着美军服装的台湾蒋匪特务，其中为首的名叫葛天民。另一个归来人员张田曾亲眼看到，一个姓李的台湾蒋匪特务，穿着新打上的“PW”（战俘）字样的衣服，进入了中立国看管营场。
    在九月十五日，特务葛天民曾在李金全的帐篷里说：“要把身强力壮的人组织成绑架团，乘共产党解释代表散步或上厕所的时候，把他们拖进帐篷用手巾塞住他的嘴。这时候，就可以叫美国人来照相。然后可以对外宣布说，他要求政治避难，不愿意回到共产党那里去了。他现在不愿出来见人，不信可以看照片。”
    李金全还曾听见特务葛天民胁迫战俘们说：
  “你们每人口袋里都要装一把漂白粉，共产党解释代表来的时候，就撒在他的眼里。”第二天，美国人就给每个大队发了十多桶消毒粉，叫特务们藉口作洗东西之用带进营场。归来人员张田说，就是他看见的那个姓李的台湾蒋匪特务曾对战俘说过：要“弄死中立国波兰、捷克和印度的代表”。这个特务并胁迫战俘们：“看我的眼色行事”。所以这六十五名归来人员昨天在板门店帐篷时，曾再三对中国人民志愿军军官说：“咱们解释代表和中立国代表去的时候千万要小心啊！”
    李金全也证实了蒋匪特务把电台带进了营场。他说：“第一联队联队长、大特务王顺清已经进了中立国看管营地。他们在济州岛时就有一架收发报机，这次已将电台拆散成零件分别带了进去，同时还带去了三部打字机、一架油印机。”
    这六十五名归来人员在济州岛上因为流露出要回国的愿望，被美方另外拘禁起来，准备加以杀害。后来，美方有些害怕将来泄露了消息，受到舆论指责，就威胁他们，逼迫他们向美军宪兵司令部写了“保证回台湾”的血书。八月二十七日蒋匪特务头子方治还为此专门找李金全去“个别谈话”，进行种种威胁，甚至无耻地利诱说：“要是你们都不回去，我保证你将来到台湾可以做大官！”方治透露：“要是有一个人回去，就把一万四千人的秘密都暴露了。这是美国在政治会议上成功和失败的关键！”
    他们到了中立国看管营地后，被单独拘留在一个小铁丝网里，就暗中酝酿在解释工作开始之前突破特务的控制，向中立国要求遣返。九月二十三日，“第一联队”的特务们“命令”他们在二十四日举行反对解释工作的“示威”。他们拒绝接受这个“命令”，在二十五日赶走了潜伏在他们中的特务分子，并在当天夜里向印度军官要求遣返。他们并连夜赶制了祖国的五星红旗。
    第二天上午，在他们附近营场里的特务分子就强迫战俘们集合在铁丝网前面，准备冲出去用石块打他们。这六十五个人便高声唱歌，并呼喊口号：“反对美帝国主义屠杀战俘、扣留战俘！”“反对蒋介石特务残杀战俘！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    下午一时左右，印度部队派车把他们接出营场的时候，这六十多名走向自由的人们，就在车上高举起鲜明的五星国旗，使附近营场里都能看见。他们并高声唱歌和呼口号，把写好的传单向他们苦难的弟兄们尽力抛去。他们大喊：“同志们，回祖国的时机到了！”这时，营场里的特务分子害怕得赶紧把我方被俘人员赶进帐篷，外面有提着木棍、旗杆的特务在巡逻，不准我方被俘人员出来观看。
