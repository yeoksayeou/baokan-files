    With a sincerely moved heart, I extend to you the congratulations of Poland, the homeland of Nicolaus Copernicus.
    Our two countries were once separated by distant mountains and forests, fettered by feudal chains and the shackles of capitalist exploitation, so that there was no mutual understanding between the two countries.
    Today, the hands of millions of working people have shattered these chains. Our two liberated countries have formed a large family of free people working for peace and fighting for peace, for the sake of a better future for mankind.
    Today, the understanding between our two countries has been increasing day by day, and is united by a deep and sincere feeling.
    Today, there is no one in Poland who does not know about the great transformations taking place in your great and beautiful country. Our children are also learning in schools the history, culture, and heroism of the great Chinese people.
    The hearts of our entire people yearn for the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers. They are fighting against the imperialist aggressors for the freedom, independence, and peace of their countries. When our workers, farmers, intellectuals, and all our working masses are redoubling their efforts in their creative and daily work for peace, their hearts are with the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    Our two countries are united today for a common goal—that is, we are fighting to consolidate world peace, to build a better tomorrow for working people, and to establish a truly just social system. In this struggle, we are supported and assisted by our greatest friend, the leading force of the peace camp, our neighbors, the powerful socialist country, the Soviet Union.
    Our countries are united by our love for all beautiful things and our respect for national culture, science, and art.
    I am honored to be able to represent the Polish Peace Defenders Committee in this country with thousands of years of history, a country that has contributed many inventions to mankind in culture, scholarship, and art.
    Today, I have come to a country where astronomy has been developed for thousands of years. In this country, methods for calculating solar and lunar eclipses were known very early, the orbits of planets were known very early, and armillary spheres were manufactured very early.
    Under the call of the World Peace Council, countries around the world are commemorating this year the great thinkers, scholars, and giants of the scientific community; the brilliant work of these giants has raised the culture and knowledge of all mankind to new and higher levels.
    Among these commemorated giants are the giant of the Chinese nation, Qu Yuan, and our great scientist and ardent patriot, Nicolaus Copernicus.
    When we see today the simple instruments Copernicus used to measure celestial bodies: wooden frames, glued wooden circles, and metal discs with holes, we can only pay tribute to his genius and admire his courage.
    Regardless of the long-standing beliefs held by tradition, Copernicus challenged superstition, overthrew the old theory of celestial motion, stopped the sun, and made the earth revolve. After discovering the truth, he did not succumb to the threats and pressures imposed on him by the political oligarchs of the church, and he insisted on this truth until his death. He used decades of patient work to prove that he would never be wrong. He discovered the laws of the universe's circulation.
    For us, Copernicus is not only a model scientist who uncovers mysteries. He did not hide in the stars, he did not forget the earth and the people on earth. He loved the land of Poland, he defended Poland, and did not allow invaders to come. He was deeply interested in everything in the social life around him. He was an outstanding economist, he published papers on currency reform, treated patients, engaged in creation, and he also painted. He loved mankind, he loved the truth, and he also loved beauty.
    Today, in People's Poland, we are collecting everything related to this outstanding scientist with great enthusiasm and care. The place where he lived, where he created and invented, is cherished with meticulous care. Grand exhibitions have been held at Jagiellonian University in Krakow and in Frombork on the Baltic coast. Jagiellonian University is where he initially studied, and Frombork is where he engaged in planetary observation and where he passed away.
    His thought is a scientific legacy and has become the wealth of all mankind.
    The great Qu Yuan also had a deep love for his motherland; for two thousand years, this poet, politician, and patriot has been revered by the Chinese people.
    Qu Yuan's inspiration came from folk traditions, this tradition is a great academy of wisdom, a true treasure trove of human experience. He had profound knowledge, a natural calm foresight and a sensitive heart. He loved his country and he loved his people, he dedicated his poems to them.
    We are very pleased that the treasure of Chinese culture, Qu Yuan's great poems, can now be spread to various countries, and our country will also translate these poems so that we can appreciate their beauty.
    This great, tragic representative figure, sage, and poet Qu Yuan, has won the sympathy of all those who love their country and are willing to serve their country. The great modern poet Guo Moruo chose Qu Yuan as the protagonist in his play that called on the Chinese people to unite and fight against the invaders. This event further proves the vitality of Qu Yuan's works.
    All progressive mankind is commemorating the great figures Qu Yuan, Copernicus, Rabelais, and Marty. These figures are models for all of us, models of how we should serve our country and all mankind, and models of how we should serve the cause of peace.
    Polish peace fighters salute Chinese peace fighters, and they also salute great China. Today, the Chinese people are putting all their strength into peaceful construction for the prosperity of their country. At the same time, they are fighting for world peace and international friendship.
    As China moves forward on this road, an increasing number of countries have joined hands with it. The peace camp has become increasingly strong, and it has now become an invincible force.
    Long live Sino-Polish friendship!
    Long live science and art serving peace!

    在北京纪念四位世界文化名人大会上
    波兰代表苏克罗夫斯基的讲话
    我以诚恳地感动的心情，向诸位传达尼古劳斯·哥白尼的祖国，波兰，对你们的祝贺。
    我们两国曾经一度由于深山丛林的远隔，由于封建铁链的羁绊和资本主义剥削的枷锁，以致两国之间彼此毫无认识。
    今天，千百万劳动人民的双手已经粉碎了这些铁链。我们两个解放了的国家，为了争取人类美好的未来，已经结成了一个为着和平而工作的，为着和平而斗争的，自由人民的大家庭。
    今天，我们两个国家彼此之间的了解已经日益增进，并由一种深厚而真诚的感情给团结在一起了。
    今天，在波兰已经没有一个人不知道在你们这个伟大而美丽的国家里所发生的一切巨大的转变。我国的儿童们也都在学校里学习伟大的中国人民的历史、文化和他们的英雄气概。
    我们全国人民的心，向往着朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军。他们是为着他们国家的自由、独立及和平而对帝国主义侵略者进行斗争的。当我们的工人、农民、知识分子和我们全体劳动群众，为了和平而加倍努力从事他们的创造性的和日常的工作的时候，他们的心是向着朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的。
    我们两国今天为着一个共同的目标而团结在一起——这就是说，我们是为巩固世界和平，为建立对劳动人民更美好的明天，和为建立一个真正的正义社会制度而斗争。在这个斗争中，我们从我们最伟大的朋友，和平阵营的指导力量，我们两国的邻邦，强大的社会主义国家苏联得到支持与帮助。
    我们这些国家是被我们对一切美好事物的热爱和对民族文化、科学、艺术的尊重，而团结在一起的。
    我很荣幸地能够代表波兰保卫和平委员会到这个有数千年悠久历史的国家里来，到这个在文化、学术和艺术上对人类贡献了许多发明的国家来。
    今天我到的这个国家，是天文学发达了数千年的国家。在这个国家里，很早就知道计算日蚀和月蚀的方法，很早就知道计算星球运行的轨道，很早就知道制造浑天仪。
    在世界和平理事会的号召之下，全世界各国都在今年纪念伟大的思想家、学者、和科学界的巨人；这些巨人的光辉的工作将全人类的文化和知识提到了新的和更高的水平。
    在这些被纪念的巨人中间，有中华民族的巨人屈原，我国的伟大科学家及热忱的爱国者——尼古劳斯·哥白尼。
    当我们今天看到哥白尼用来测量天体的简陋仪器：木架子、胶合的木制圈子，有孔的金属盘子的时候，我们只有向他的天才思想致敬，我们只有对他的勇气表示钦佩。
    哥白尼不顾长期传统所崇奉的信仰，向迷信挑战，推翻了旧的天体运行的学说，他止住了太阳，而使地球转动起来。他发现了真理之后，就没有向教会的政治寡头所加在他身上的威胁及压力屈服，他一直到死仍坚持这个真理。他用几十年的耐心工作来证明他自己决不会错误。他发现了宇宙循环的规律。
    对我们来说，哥白尼不仅是一个揭穿神秘的模范科学家。他没有躲藏到星球中去，他没有忘记地球及地球上的人民。他热爱着波兰的国土，他保卫波兰，不许侵略者来进犯。他对于他周围的社会生活的每一件事情都深深感到兴趣。他是个卓越的经济学家，他发表过币制改革的论文，医治过病人，从事过创作，他也绘画。他热爱人类，热爱真理，同时也热爱美。
    今日，在人民的波兰，我们正以极大的热情小心收集一切有关这位卓越的科学家的遗物。他所住的地方，也就是他创作和发明的地方，受到人们无微不至的爱护。在克拉科夫的雅吉隆大学里，在波罗的海岸的弗劳恩堡，都举行过盛大的展览会，雅吉隆大学是他当初学习的地方，而弗劳恩堡则是他从事行星观测和他逝世的地方。
    他的思想，是科学的遗产，并且已经成为全人类的财富。
    伟大的屈原，对自己的祖国也同样地具有深忱的热爱；两千年来，这位诗人，政治家和爱国者，一直受到中国人民的崇敬。
    屈原的灵感是从民间传统中吸取来的，这种传统是伟大的智慧的学院，是人类经验的真正宝库。他有着渊博的学问，有着一种天赋的冷静的预见和一颗感觉敏锐的心。他热爱他的祖国，也热爱他的人民，他把他的诗歌献给了他们。
    使我们感到非常高兴的是：中国文化的宝藏屈原的伟大的诗——现在得以流传到各国，而且我国也将翻译这些诗篇，以便我们领略其中的优美。
    这位伟大的、悲剧的代表人物，圣贤和诗人屈原，得到了一切热爱祖国并愿为祖国服务的人们的同情。伟大的现代诗人郭沫若，在他那号召中国人民团结一致与侵略者斗争的剧本中，选择了屈原作为剧中的主角。这件事情，就更证明了屈原的作品的生命力。
    所有进步的人类都在纪念伟大的人物屈原、哥白尼、拉伯雷和马蒂。这些人物是我们大家的模范，是我们如何为祖国和为全人类服务的模范，是我们应如何为和平事业服务的模范。
    波兰的和平战士向中国的和平战士致敬，他们同时向伟大的中国致敬。今天，中国人民是为了自己国家的繁荣而把所有的力量投入了和平建设。他们也同时为争取世界和平与国际间的友好而进行着斗争。
    当中国向着这条道路前进的时候，日益众多的国家已和它携起手来了。和平阵营已日益壮大，它今天已经成为一种不可战胜的力量。
    波中友好万岁！
    为和平服务的科学和艺术万岁！
