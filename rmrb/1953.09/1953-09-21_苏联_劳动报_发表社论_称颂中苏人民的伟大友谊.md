Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Soviet "Labor Daily" and "Komsomolskaya Pravda" both published editorials on the 19th, commenting on Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government's telegram to Chairman G.M. Malenkov of the Soviet Council of Ministers thanking the Soviet Union for its assistance in China's economic construction, praising the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

    The "Labor Daily," in an editorial entitled "The Indestructible Friendship of the Peoples of Two Great Powers," spoke of the reception of Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Zhang Wentian by Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, and Chairman Mao's telegram to Comrade Malenkov, pointing out that this is a remarkable example of the new type of relationship formed between the countries of the great democratic and socialist camp, composed of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries. The "Labor Daily" emphasized that the international aggressive forces fear the achievements of the People's Republic of China and the achievements of Sino-Soviet friendship. They are doing everything possible to prevent the great Chinese people from victoriously advancing toward a peaceful and happy life. But they have miscalculated once again. The Chinese people are increasingly consolidating the strength of the powerful anti-imperialist camp with the great victories they have achieved in the struggle for a new life. All Soviet people, the people of the countries of the peaceful and democratic camp, and all progressive humanity deeply sympathize with, cherish, and selflessly support the glorious Chinese patriots. Long live the great friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union!
    "Komsomolskaya Pravda," in an editorial entitled "The Fraternity of Great Peoples," said: The strength of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, united in the powerful democratic and socialist camp, is constantly growing and strengthening. Mutual concern for the interests of the countries of the democratic camp and close economic cooperation are the source of this strength.

    苏联“劳动报”发表社论
    称颂中苏人民的伟大友谊
    据新华社讯：苏联“劳动报”和“青年团真理报”都在十九日发表社论，就我中央人民政府毛泽东主席给苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫感谢苏联对中国经济建设援助的电文，评论中苏两国人民的伟大友谊。
    “劳动报”在题为“两大国人民的牢不可破的友谊”的社论中，谈到了苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志接见我国驻苏联大使张闻天和毛主席致马林科夫同志的电文，指出这是由苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家参加的伟大的民主和社会主义阵营各国之间形成的新型关系的显著例子。“劳动报”强调说：国际侵略势力害怕中华人民共和国的成就，害怕苏中友谊的成就。他们百般阻挠伟大的中国人民向和平的幸福的生活胜利地前进。可是他们又一次地失算了。中国人民以自己在争取新生活的斗争中所获得的伟大胜利来日益巩固着强大的反帝国主义阵营的力量。全体苏联人民、和平民主阵营各国人民以及全体进步人类，都深切地同情、爱护并无私地支持光荣的中国爱国者。中国和苏联的伟大友好同盟万岁！
    “青年团真理报”在题为“伟大人民的友爱”的社论中说：团结在强大的民主和社会主义阵营中的苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的力量，正在不断地增长和加强着。民主阵营各国利益上的互相关心和密切的经济合作，是这个力量的源泉。
