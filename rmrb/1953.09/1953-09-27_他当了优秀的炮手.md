    He Became an Excellent Gunner
    Jiang Qing
    I
    In the winter of 1951, Li Shusen was still a new gunner, studying in the artillery training team.
    At graduation, the whole team conducted a live firing exercise. Li Shusen and another gunner, Lü Zhiquan, had a dispute when measuring the distance. Li Shusen said, "Seven hundred meters!" Lü Zhiquan said, "At most, it won't exceed six hundred meters!" Neither of them understood the mil calculation method, they were just relying on their eyes. Who was right? Li Shusen had no other choice but to "compromise," "Six hundred and fifty meters is about right!" Three shells were fired, but completely unexpectedly, the observer in the rear shouted angrily, "None of them hit!" And then added, "Three big breads!"
    The two gunners were so ashamed that they couldn't lift their heads, their faces red all the way to their necks. They knelt beside the gun, not knowing what to do.
    That night at the meal, everyone else was in high spirits, but Li Shusen didn't taste anything. He wiped his mouth with his chopsticks a few times and went back to the barracks alone to clean the gun.
    Sitting outside the window, Li Shusen thought about his experiences as a gunner for the past six months. As soon as he entered the artillery training team, he wholeheartedly wanted to become a good gunner. Every day at noon, when others were resting, he never took a nap, either asking the squad leader to explain the principles of the course ten or eight times, or braving the southern sun in July and August to practice estimating distances in the mountains and fields. But he had never expected that in the end, he would still eat three "big breads"!
    He tossed and turned all night, thinking, does having no education mean it's all over? He remembered what the instructor told him when he joined the Communist Party of China: "In front of a Communist Party member, there are no insurmountable difficulties!"
    The next morning, as soon as the squad leader finished washing his face, he saw Li Shusen running over with a pen, smiling, asking him to write three characters on his palm. The squad leader saw through his thoughts at a glance, took the pen, and said:
    "If you want to write, write five. I'll teach you whenever I have time, but you have to seize the time to learn!"
    Li Shusen looked at the squad leader gratefully, clenched his fist, and replied, "Squad leader, don't worry, even if it takes ten years, I will become a good gunner in the modern national defense army and defend the motherland!"
    II
    But Li Shusen's "ten-year plan" had just started for less than ten days when Chairman Mao's order was transmitted to the company—in order to build a strong and modern national defense army, large-scale cultural learning must be launched immediately!
    As soon as Li Shusen heard this good news in the dining hall, he immediately put down his bowl and chopsticks and went into the room, standing under Chairman Mao's portrait, constantly saying, "Chairman Mao, great Chairman Mao, you are really thoughtful for us!"
    In less than three months, Li Shusen was able to read books and newspapers. One day he borrowed a "Supplementary Textbook for Artillery" from the deputy platoon leader and began to read it. The more he read, the more excited he became: "This time I've found the direction of my efforts." But the cultural classes were very tight, so how could he have time to read this book? Li Shusen thought for a moment, and that night he asked for leave to go to the street and bought six batteries.
    For several nights in a row, the soldiers in the squad, after coming back from their shifts, often heard Li Shusen muttering something in his quilt about "area fire, echelon fire..." Sometimes they even heard him laughing. Everyone said, "Li Shusen is obsessed with learning culture!"
    That night, the squad leader, while on sentry duty, deliberately detoured past the room where Li Shusen lived, and again heard Li Shusen talking in his "sleep." The squad leader tiptoed to his bed, lifted the mosquito net, and pulled back his quilt, wanting to wake him up. But Li Shusen was hiding in the quilt, using a flashlight to shine on a book, reading it word by word! He took it over and saw that it was an artillery textbook. Originally, the squad leader wanted to take it away, but after thinking about it, he returned it to him, but said seriously, "I'm giving it back to you, but now is not the time to read. Put it away and go to sleep! You must correct this in the future."
    Li Shusen went to sleep with a red face. After that, he used all the gaps during the day to carry out extracurricular studies. Soon, his Chinese language level had reached the level of a primary school graduate, and he had also finished reading two and a half artillery textbooks. By this time, he had been promoted from soldier to squad leader of the gun squad.
    Next, he led the entire squad to intensify their study and mastery of arithmetic, which was even more closely related to the cannons. On the afternoon of the day they finished learning the four operations with integers, Li Shusen took everyone to practice. Li Shusen stood on a mound, looked at a large tree about a li away in front, and shouted a command. The soldiers looked at the mil division scale according to the command, and began to calculate according to the formula. Gao Diancheng was the first to shout, "Five hundred meters!" But looking at that big tree, it was quite far away, so was it right? He himself was a little doubtful. Li Shusen said with a smile, "Go get a rope and measure it to see if our national defense army is qualified enough!" Gao Diancheng measured for a while, and hey, it was only one meter off! The soldiers immediately cheered! Gao Diancheng jumped up excitedly and shouted, "This time it's great, we've got the key to mastering the cannon!" At the end of the cultural learning, Li Shusen was awarded a first-class merit. He was promoted from squad leader to deputy platoon leader. The learning group he led originally had four illiterate people, but now they have all become junior high school students; the original gunner Lü Zhiquan, the ammunition handler Gao Diancheng, and the bugler Li Chunfa have all become squad leaders, and the ammunition handler Wang Youdao has become the deputy squad leader; the three soldiers who were originally members of the Communist Youth League have all joined the Communist Party of China.
    However, amidst the many happy events of this cultural learning, Li Shusen had been carrying one worry in his heart—could the shooting technique withstand the test of actual practice?
    III
    He was looking forward to this day. This day finally arrived. One morning in February, the entire regiment organized a live firing exercise to test the shells.
    The weather was very bad that day. An gale of level eight from the sea roared across the wilderness. A thick fog of dust and sand constantly rolled from the target range into the high sky. The eyes of all the soldiers in the squad showed a worried look, staring intently at Li Shusen's gun. Lü Zhiquan, the gunner who was particularly concerned about Li Shusen, constantly cursed the bad weather.
    Li Shusen's tall body knelt beside the shiny gun, his serious expression making him appear particularly calm. He skillfully determined the wind direction, calculated the distance, and agilely turned a small wheel a few turns. He looked at the aiming device twice, and carefully corrected it with a plumb bob, and then quietly waited for the commander's order.
    The sea wind blew his hat brim up and down constantly. He squinted and looked at the target circle—a few small trees were almost pressed to the ground by the wind, and the grass-tied simulated enemies were swaying in the wind. The target circle seemed to be made in the same way as a year ago. Li Shusen's memory of the "three breads" suddenly became particularly strong! The various efforts and hard training of the past year also seemed to flash past in a second. The more he thought about it, the more nervous he became.
    The firing order sounded, and nine shells were fired in succession. The first shell was a trial shot. The second shell hit less than four meters from the target. After the third shell was fired, a cloud of black smoke and yellow earth rose from the target circle. The shell hit the target squarely!
    Li Shusen suddenly felt his face burning as if a fire had been lit, and he slightly moved the small wheel. He quickly fired the fourth shell. A thick smoke rose from the target circle again, and the soldiers' cheers and applause were already resounding. He fired three more shells in a row, only to hear the observer's sharp voice constantly and happily shouting, "Hit! Hit!" The soldiers excitedly shouted amidst the applause, "Knock down that little tree!" "Hit that scarecrow!" Li Shusen skillfully fired the last two shells.
    Amidst the deafening shouts, Li Shusen watched with his own eyes as his shells hit the ground under the small tree, creating a tall column of smoke. The branches and leaves shot into the sky with the thick smoke, and then another column of smoke rose. After the strong wind dispersed the black smoke, the scarecrow in the target circle had disappeared without a trace.
    At this time, the soldiers swarmed up and surrounded him. Dozens of fiery hands grabbed his sweaty arms. Li Shusen felt particularly strongly at that moment that his whole body was filled with new confidence and strength.

    他当了优秀的炮手
    江清
    一
    一九五一年冬天，李树森还是个新炮手，在炮兵训练队学习。
    毕业的时候，全队进行了一次实弹射击，李树森和另一个炮手吕治全在测量距离时，发生了争执。李树森说：“七百公尺！”吕治全说：“最多过不去六百公尺！”两个人都不懂密位计算法，只是凭眼睛，谁对呢？李树森没有别的办法，只好“折衷”一下，“六百五十公尺差不多吧！”三发炮弹打出去了，可是完全出乎意料之外，后面的观察员气呼呼地喊着说：“一发都没打中！”并且接着还补充了这么一句：“三个大面包！”
    两个炮手一下子羞的脑袋都抬不起来，脸一直红到了脖根上。跪在炮的旁边，不知道应该怎样才好。
    那天晚上会餐，别人全都兴高采烈，唯独李树森吃什么也没味，筷子在嘴上抹了几下，就独个儿回班擦炮去了。
    李树森坐在窗外，想起了半年来学习炮手的事情，一进炮兵训练队，他就一心一意想当个好炮手，每天中午，别人都休息，他总是不睡午觉，不是请班长十遍八遍地讲解课程的道理，就是冒着南方七八月的太阳，在山野上练习目测距离。可是从来也没有料想过，到临了，还是吃了三个“大面包”！
    整整一夜，他翻来覆去地想，没有文化，就拉倒了吗？他记起加入中国共产党的时候，指导员对他说的话：“在一个共产党员的面前，没有克服不了的困难！”
    第二天一清早，班长刚洗完脸，就见李树森笑嘻嘻地拿着一只钢笔跑来，要求往他手掌上写三个字。班长一眼就看透了他的心事，接过笔来说：
  “要写就写五个，我每天抽空教给你，可是你得抓紧时间学习！”
    李树森感激地望着班长，把拳头一攒，回答说：“班长你放心，就是学十年，我也要学成一个现代化国防军的好炮手，保卫祖国！”
    二
    但是李树森的“十年计划”刚开始不到十天，毛主席的命令传达到连队里来了——为了建设强大的现代化国防军，必须立即展开大规模的文化学习！
    李树森在饭堂里一知道这个喜讯，就连忙放下碗筷钻进房里，站在毛主席的像下，不住地说：“毛主席呀，伟大的毛主席，您老人家替我们想的真周到啊！”
    不到三个月，李树森能够阅读书报了。有一天他向副排长借了一本“炮兵补充教材”，翻开就读了起来。他越读越兴奋：“这回可把努力方向找出来了。”可是文化课很紧，那有看这书的时间呢？李树森想了一下，当天晚上就请假上街，买了六筒电池回来。
    一连几个夜晚，班里的战士下岗回来，常常听到李树森在被子里叨念什么“面积射，梯级射……”有时还听见他乐的发笑。大家都说：“李树森学文化入了迷啦！”
    这天夜里，班长带哨时特意绕过李树森住的那间屋子，又听见李树森在说“梦话”了。班长颠着脚尖走到他床前，撩开蚊帐，把他的被子掀开，想唤醒他。那知李树森正躲在被子里，用电筒照着一本书，一字一句地往下念呢！拿过来一看，原来是一本炮兵教材，本来班长想把它拿走，想了一下，仍还给他，但是严肃地说：“还给你，可是现在不是读书的时候，收起来，睡觉！以后必须改正。”
    李树森红着脸睡了，以后他就利用白天的一切空隙进行课外学习。很快，他的语文程度已经达到高小毕业，炮兵教材也念完了两本半，这时他已从战士升为炮班的班长了。
    接着，他又领导全班加紧学习与掌握大炮关系更加密切的算术。刚学完整数四则的那天下午，李树森带着大家想实习一下。李树森站到一个土堆上，望着前面约一里远的一棵大树就喊了一声口令。战士们按着口令看了看密位分划尺，照着公式开始计算，高殿成第一个喊起来：“五百公尺！”可是一看那大树挺老远，对不对呢，自己也有些怀疑。李树森笑着说：“拿根绳子去量一量，看咱们这国防军到底够不够格！”高殿成量了一阵，嘿，只差一公尺！战士们顿时欢呼起来！高殿成乐的一蹦多高，喊道：“这回可好了，掌握大炮有门啦！”文化学习结束时李树森立了一等功，又从班长升为副排长，他领导的学习小组原来是四个文盲，现在都已经成为初中学生；原来的炮手吕治全，弹药手高殿成和司号员李春发都当了班长，弹药手王有道当了副班长；原先是青年团员的三个战士，都参加了中国共产党。
    可是，在这文化学习的重重喜事中，李树森一直还担着一桩心事——射击的技术，能经得起实际的考验么？
    三
    他盼望这一天，这一天终于来到了，二月里的一个早晨，全团组织了试验炮弹的实弹射击。
    这天天气很坏，从海上吹来的八级风吼叫着奔过原野，一阵浓似一阵的灰沙不断地从靶场上卷向高空。全班战士的眼睛都露出担忧的神色，紧紧地望着李树森的这门炮。特别关心李树森的炮手吕治全不断地咒骂着坏天气。
    李树森高大的身体跪在闪光的炮身旁边，严肃的表情，显得他特别沉着。他熟练地测定了风向，算定了距离，敏捷地把一个小轮盘扭了几转。他把眼睛对着瞄准器望了两遍，又谨慎地用垂球校正了一下，就静静地等着指挥员的命令。
    海风吹得他的帽檐不住地上下跳动，他眯着眼又望了望那靶圈——几棵小树给风吹得几乎要压到地面上去了，草扎的假设敌人在风里直摇晃，靶圈仿佛还是照一年前那个样子做的。李树森对“三个面包”的记忆突然格外地强烈起来！一年来的各种努力和苦练也仿佛在一秒钟内闪了过去，他越想越觉得紧张起来。
    射击口令响了，九发炮弹连续射出，第一发是试射，第二发打到距靶不到四公尺的地方，第三发射出后，一阵黑烟黄土从靶圈里升起来，炮弹不偏不斜地射中了目标！
    李树森突然感到脸上像点起一把火似地昏热起来，他轻轻地把小轮盘略为拨动了一下，迅速地射出了第四发。一阵浓烟又从靶圈里冲上天空，战士们的欢呼和掌声已经响成一片。他一连又射出三发，只听得观察员的尖嗓门愉快地不断直喊“命中！命中！”战士们在掌声中兴奋地喊着：“把那小树撂倒啊！”“打那草人呀！”李树森又熟练地射出了最后两发。
    在震耳的喊声中，李树森亲眼看着自己的炮弹在小树下打起了高高的一条烟柱，树枝树叶随着浓烟冲上了半天空，接着又是一条烟柱冲起来，急风吹散黑烟后，靶圈里的草人已无影无踪了。
    这时，战士们蜂拥上来把他团团围住，几十双火热的大手抓住了他汗淋淋的胳臂。李树森一时特别强烈地感到自己浑身上下都灌满了新的信心和力量。
