Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th: The construction of power stations is continuing in the Soviet countryside, and news of the completion of new rural hydroelectric power stations is coming from all over.

    In the Russian Federation, the Lenin Collective Farm in Grozny Oblast recently completed a rural hydroelectric power station on the Asa River. This power station has been supplying electricity to the collective farmers' homes and the farm's various production departments. The electricity used by collective farms throughout the state is now forty-nine times greater than in the early years after the Patriotic War. In Moscow Oblast, the Gorbov Hydropower Station on the Luzha River was also recently completed. This is one of the largest rural hydroelectric power stations in Moscow Oblast, with a generating capacity of 360 kilowatts. Its electricity can fully supply the residences, twenty-eight livestock farms, threshing grounds, and other departments in the forty-four residential areas of the district's collective farms. The Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic will complete eight rural hydroelectric power stations this year. A new rural hydroelectric power station in the Khunzakh District began supplying electricity to several mountain villages in early August.

    Other Soviet republics have also completed the construction of many new rural hydroelectric power stations. The Belarusian Republic is working intensively to build seventy-two rural power stations. A large rural hydroelectric power station on the Opol River in Vitebsk Oblast has begun generating electricity for several collective farms. Four powerful rural power stations in Minsk Oblast and Grodno Oblast are nearing completion. To date, 600 collective farms throughout the republic have used electricity. The Kazakh Republic has completed eleven rural hydroelectric power stations and two collective farm thermal power stations this year. Recently, two rural hydroelectric power stations with generating capacities of 176 kilowatts and 520 kilowatts were built in Semipalatinsk Oblast and Jambyl Oblast, respectively. The latter power station is already serving five large collective farms and two state-owned sugar beet farms with electricity. In total, there are already 1,560 rural and collective farm hydroelectric and thermal power stations throughout the republic; another sixty-one power stations are still under construction, and the Talgar Hydroelectric Power Station in Almaty Oblast will soon be completed. In addition, the Ukrainian Republic and the Azerbaijan Republic have also recently completed two rural hydroelectric power stations.

    苏联陆续建成许多农村水力发电站
    【新华社十八日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联农村正在继续进行电力站的建设，各地纷纷传来新的农村水电站落成的消息。
    在俄罗斯联邦，格罗兹尼州列宁集体农庄最近在阿萨河上建成了一座农村水电站，这座水电站已经把电流源源送到集体农民的住宅和农庄的各个生产部门。全州集体农庄使用的电力，现在已比卫国战争后最初几年多四十九倍。在莫斯科州，卢兹河畔的戈尔包夫水电站也在不久以前建成。这是莫斯科州最大的农村水电站之一，发电能力是三百六十瓩，它的电力可以充分供给该区集体农庄的四十四个居民区的住宅、二十八个饲畜场、打谷场和其他部门使用。达吉斯坦自治共和国今年建成的农村水电站将达八个。其中洪扎赫区的一个新的农村水电站已在八月上旬开始向几个山村供电。
    苏联其他加盟共和国也完成了许多新的农村水电站的建设工作。白俄罗斯共和国正在紧张地建造七十二个农村电力站。在维切布斯克州奥波尔河上的一座巨大的农村水电站，已经开始为几个集体农庄发电。明斯克州和格罗德诺州有四个效力强大的农村电力站即将完工。到现在为止，全共和国已有六百个集体农庄使用了电力。哈萨克共和国今年已经建成十一个农村水电站和两个集体农庄火力发电站。最近塞米巴拉丁斯克州和江布尔州又分别建成了发电能力为一百七十六瓩和五百二十瓩的两个农村水电站。后一个水电站已经以电力为五个大集体农庄和两个种甜菜的国营农场服务。全共和国总共已经有一千五百六十个农村和集体农庄水电站和火力发电站；另有六十一个发电站还正在建筑中，阿拉木图州塔尔加尔水电站不久就要完成了。此外，乌克兰共和国和阿塞拜疆共和国，最近也建成了两个农村水电站。
