Local Opera Troupes from Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei Provinces Gather in Wuhan for Public Performances

The Guangxi Gui Opera Troupe, the Hunan United Opera Troupe, and the Hubei Provincial Local Opera Troupe, among others, gathered in Hankou in late August and gave public performances of excellent opera programs popular in Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. Among them, the Gui Opera pieces "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" and "Stopping the Horse at the Pass," the Xiang Opera pieces "Pipa on the Road," "Hunting and Returning with a Letter," and "Drunkenly Beating the Mountain Gate," and the Flower Drum Opera pieces "Liu Hai Cuts Firewood" and "Thinking of the Mortal World" had all won awards at the First National Opera Festival.

This time, the public performances of opera programs from various provinces in Wuhan greatly enlivened the cultural life of the broad masses of working people in Wuhan, making them more aware of the excellence and richness of the motherland's national art. Every day, around 4,000 people, men and women, old and young, came from all directions to watch the performances of these opera genres. Many new programs also received unanimous praise from the audience. For example, after the newly staged Gui Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" was performed, the audience wrote letters to the opera troupe and the local newspaper, praising the script adapter's prudence, meticulousness, and boldness in creating success, as well as the actors' seriousness and earnestness during the performance. The Hubei Local Opera Troupe adapted the Shanghai Opera "Luohan Money" and the Flower Drum Opera "Liu Hai Cuts Firewood" into popular song and dance dramas evolved from Chu Opera, winning the audience's favor and welcome.

In order to better meet the growing cultural needs of the working people, the troupes that came to Hankou also exchanged information and opinions on various aspects such as playwriting, dubbing, scenery, and performance with the troupes of various opera genres in Wuhan, and held observation performances on the 10th and 11th to exchange experiences and learn from each other.
