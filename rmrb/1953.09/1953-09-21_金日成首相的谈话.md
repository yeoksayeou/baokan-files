Premier Kim Il-sung's Talk

Respected Chairman Malenkov! Dear Comrades!

On behalf of the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government, the Soviet people, the Soviet Party, and all the leaders of the government for their friendly reception, and especially to the respected Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov personally for his special care for our delegation during our stay in Moscow. Thanks to this hospitality and care, the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was able to successfully complete its mission in a friendly atmosphere.

The great Soviet Union liberated our country from the long-term rule of Japanese imperialism, created all the conditions for the establishment of a people's regime in North Korea, ensured the realization of democratic reforms, and helped our people restore and develop our national economy, which was destroyed by Japanese imperialism, with large-scale material and technical assistance.

The comprehensive assistance given to the Korean people by the Soviet Union in accordance with the Economic and Cultural Mutual Assistance Agreement concluded between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Soviet Union in 1949 is of decisive importance for the further democratic development of our country.

After liberation, thanks to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the selfless labor of our people, the material and cultural living standards of our North Korean people have been rapidly improved, and a strong democratic base has been created for the peaceful reunification of our motherland.

The armed attack launched by the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, the Syngman Rhee clique, against our republic aroused the anger and hatred of all our people towards the invaders. Our people took up arms and devoted themselves wholeheartedly to the war to win the freedom and independence of their motherland and defend our people's democratic system. Together with the Chinese People's Volunteers, they showed unparalleled heroism.

Thanks to the fraternal assistance and support of the Chinese people, the people's democratic countries, and the entire democratic and socialist camp headed by the great Soviet people, the Korean people defended their freedom and independence, crushed the U.S. imperialist aggressive plan to enslave our country, and forced them to sign the armistice agreement.

We believe that this is not only a victory for the Korean and Chinese people, but also a victory for the entire camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, and this is completely correct.

When our motherland was in its most difficult years, the Soviet Union led the democratic forces of the world to provide the Korean people with great help and support, defended our legitimate rights and interests on the international stage, encouraged our people to carry out selfless struggles for the cause of justice, and strengthened our people's confidence in victory. This is one of the decisive factors for our people to win victory.

Today, the most urgent and important task facing our people is to restore and develop the national economy destroyed by the war as soon as possible, restore and improve the material well-being of our people, and further strengthen the material basis for the peaceful reunification of our motherland. These tasks are, of course, huge and arduous.

But there is no doubt that the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, with the fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, will overcome all difficulties and obstacles and victoriously complete these tasks, just as they have won victory in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Soviet government have successfully held negotiations in Moscow. According to the results of the negotiations, the Korean people will receive equipment and assistance from the Soviet Union to restore and build those industrial enterprises that constitute the lifeline of our economy; the Korean people will also receive assistance that will play a major role in the future development of our agriculture and culture.

This assistance will also consolidate the friendship between the people of Korea and the Soviet Union, consolidate the alliance between our workers and peasants, and provide new contributions to the cause of peacefully resolving the Korean issue, peacefully reunifying our motherland, and ensuring peace and security in Asia.

Our people, together with all progressive mankind, are heartily delighted by the great achievements made by the Soviet people under the leadership of the glorious Soviet Communist Party in the cause of building communism in the Soviet Union in order to ensure lasting peace in the world and a bright future for mankind.

Our people sincerely congratulate the Soviet people for their further and continuous achievements in the future.

Let me express my highest respect to you, and let me once again express my deep gratitude to the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people.

I wish you—respected Comrade Malenkov—good health, and let me drink to your health.

### 金日成首相的谈话

专栏：

    金日成首相的谈话敬爱的主席马林科夫同志！亲爱的同志们！
    我谨代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团对苏联政府、苏联人民、苏联党和政府的各位领袖对我们的友好款待，特别是对敬爱的格奥尔基·马克西米利安诺维奇·马林科夫个人在我国代表团停留在莫斯科期间对我们的特别关怀，表示衷心的感谢。由于这种款待和关怀，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团得以在友好的气氛中顺利地完成了它的使命。
    伟大的苏联曾把我国从日本帝国主义的长期统治下解放出来，为北朝鲜创造了建立人民政权的一切条件，保证了民主改革的实现并以大规模的物质和技术援助帮助我国人民恢复和发展为日本帝国主义所破坏的我国国民经济。
    苏联根据一九四九年朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和苏联缔结的经济与文化互助协定所给予朝鲜人民的全面援助，对我国进一步的民主发展是具有决定性的重要意义的。
    解放后，由于苏联的无私的援助和我国人民的忘我劳动，我们北朝鲜人民的物质生活和文化生活水平已迅速提高，并为和平统一我们祖国创建了有力的民主基地。
    美帝国主义及其李承晚集团的走狗们对我们共和国发动的武装进攻激起了我国全体人民对侵略者的愤怒和仇恨。我国人民拿起了武器，万众一心地投入了争取自己祖国的自由和独立、保卫我们的人民民主制度的战争，他们和中国人民志愿军一道，表现了无比的英雄气概。
    由于中国人民、各人民民主国家和以伟大的苏联人民为首的整个民主和社会主义阵营的兄弟般的援助和支持，朝鲜人民捍卫了自己的自由和独立，粉碎了美帝国主义奴役我国的侵略计划并迫使他们签订了停战协定。
    我们认为这不仅仅是朝中人民的胜利，而且也是整个和平、民主和社会主义阵营的胜利，这是完全正确的。
    当我们祖国处在最艰苦的岁月的时候，苏联率领全世界民主力量给予朝鲜人民以巨大的帮助和支持，在国际舞台上保卫着我们的合法权利和利益，鼓舞了我国人民为正义的事业进行忘我的斗争，加强了我国人民的胜利信心。这是我国人民获得胜利的决定性因素之一。
    今天，摆在我国人民面前的刻不容缓的最重要的任务，就是尽速恢复和发展为战争破坏的国民经济，恢复和提高我国人民的物质福利和进一步加强和平统一我们祖国的物质基础。这些任务当然是巨大而繁重的。
    但是毫无疑问，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的兄弟般的援助下，将克服一切困难和障碍，胜利地完成这些任务，就像他们在对国内外敌人进行斗争中取得了胜利一样。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和苏联政府已经在莫斯科顺利地举行了谈判。根据谈判结果，朝鲜人民将从苏联得到设备和帮助来恢复和建设构成我国经济命脉的那些工业企业；朝鲜人民还将获得在今后发展我国农业和文化方面将起重大作用的帮助。
    这些帮助同时将巩固朝苏两国人民的友谊，巩固我国的工农联盟，并对和平解决朝鲜问题、和平统一我们祖国及保证亚洲和平与安全的事业提供新的贡献。
    我国人民，和全体进步人类一道，对于苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党领导下为了保证全世界的持久和平和人类的美好未来，在苏联共产主义建设事业中获得的伟大成就，感到衷心的喜悦。
    我国人民衷心地祝贺苏联人民今后将进一步地、不断地获得成就。
    让我向你们表示我的崇高的敬意，让我再一次向苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民表示深深的感激。
    谨祝您——敬爱的马林科夫同志身体健康，让我为您的健康干杯。
