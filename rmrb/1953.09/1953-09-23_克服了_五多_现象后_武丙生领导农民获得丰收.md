    After Overcoming the "Five Excesses" Phenomenon
    Wu Bingsheng Leads Farmers to Achieve a Bumper Harvest
    A letter from Tan Zhendong of the Hengshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: Farmers in Beiwang Township, Hengshan, Hunan Province, have achieved a bumper harvest of mid-season rice this year. Wu Bingsheng, the Party Branch Secretary, harvested 800 catties of dry grain per mu from his 1.4 mu of high-yield fields, and an average of 710 catties per mu from the remaining five or more mu of fields, an overall increase of 20% compared to last year. His entire family is very happy. His mother said happily, "Thanks to Chairman Mao's good policies that corrected the 'Five Excesses,' our family has also improved production."

    In the past, Wu Bingsheng held many concurrent posts. He served as Party Branch Secretary, Communist Youth League Branch Secretary, Administrative Group Leader, Militia Instructor, Armed Forces Director, Deputy Principal of the People's School, Chairman of the Credit Cooperative, and Township Administrative Committee member. Especially from October of last year to the spring of this year, Beiwang Township had a lot of central work piled up, and Wu Bingsheng attended meetings every day and took the lead in everything, which made it impossible for him to engage in production. Last winter, he not only did not accumulate fertilizer, but he also had no time to grow vegetables or chop firewood. His mother and wife were angry about this every day, and Wu Bingsheng was also very distressed ideologically.

    This year in March, at the start of spring plowing, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions to Party committees at all levels regarding spring plowing and production. Beiwang Township also began to overcome the "Five Excesses" phenomenon and adopted some specific measures, so township and village cadres could participate in production to lead production. Wu Bingsheng then had time to engage in production and lead production.

    After turning to production, Wu Bingsheng first discovered that many farmers in the area did not have enough fertilizer, so he launched the mutual aid team he participated in to accumulate fertilizer, accumulating 205 dan of fertilizer within two days; this drove the 19 temporary mutual aid teams and many individual farmers throughout the township to accumulate fertilizer. When soaking seeds, Wu Bingsheng and mutual aid team leader Wu Gengsheng patiently persuaded all 16 members of the team to use salt water to select seeds, and they also motivated the neighboring six mutual aid teams to select seeds. When spring plowing was tense, Wu Bingsheng found that Luo Qiuwen, a member of the Zhu Zongwen mutual aid team, was very dissatisfied with the unfair distribution of cattle fodder in the team, so he took the initiative to go to the Zhu Zongwen mutual aid team to hold a meeting and correct the phenomenon of "mutual aid without mutual benefit" within the team, strengthening unity within the mutual aid team; other mutual aid teams followed suit and corrected this phenomenon. It is particularly worth mentioning that during the drought resistance, Wu Bingsheng, in order to fill Yinzi Pond with water, stayed by the pond every time it rained, sleeplessly irrigating and storing water all night long; and he paid attention to solving the problem of rational water use in the fields. Because he could help farmers solve problems in production in a timely manner, he won the support of the masses. His own fields also reaped a bumper harvest as a result. He said happily, "The Party wants us to participate in production and lead production, and now we have finally found the way."

### 克服了“五多”现象后  武丙生领导农民获得丰收

    克服了“五多”现象后
    武丙生领导农民获得丰收
    中共衡山县委会谭振东来信：湖南省衡山北望乡农民今年中稻丰收。党支部书记武丙生的一亩四分丰产田，每亩产干谷八百斤，其余五亩多田平均每亩产七百一十斤，总共比去年增产了两成。他全家都很欢喜。他母亲高兴地说：“搭帮毛主席政策好，纠正了‘五多’，使我家也搞好了生产。”
    过去武丙生兼职很多，他担任了党支部书记、团支部书记、行政小组长、民兵指导员、武装主任、民校副校长、信用合作社理事长、乡行政委员等职务。特别是从去年十月起到今年春天，北望乡中心工作堆得很多，武丙生天天开会，事事带头，弄得他无法生产。去年冬天，他不但没有积肥，连种菜、砍柴也没有时间。他母亲和妻子天天为此生气，武丙生思想上也很苦恼。
    今年三月春耕开始，中共中央发布了关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示。北望乡也开始克服“五多”现象，采取了一些具体办法，乡、村干部就能参加生产来领导生产了。武丙生才有时间从事生产和领导生产。
    武丙生转入生产后，首先发现当地很多农民肥料不够，于是就发动他自己参加的互助组积肥，两天之内就积了二百零五担肥料；这就带动了全乡十九个临时互助组和许多单干农民积肥。浸种时，武丙生和互助组长武庚生耐心说服全组十六户组员用盐水选种，并带动了邻近六个互助组选种。春耕紧张时，武丙生发现朱宗文互助组组员罗秋文对组里喂牛草料分担不公的情况很不满意，就主动到朱宗文互助组开会，纠正了组内“互助不互利”的现象，加强了互助组内的团结；其他互助组也跟着纠正了这种现象。特别值得提出的是，在抗旱中，武丙生为了使荫子塘能灌满水，每次下雨时都通夜不睡地守在塘边灌水蓄水；并注意解决田中合理用水的问题。因为他能及时帮助农民解决生产中的问题，就得到了群众的拥护。他自己的田也因此获得了丰收。他高兴地说：“党要我们参加生产领导生产，现在才摸到了门路。”
