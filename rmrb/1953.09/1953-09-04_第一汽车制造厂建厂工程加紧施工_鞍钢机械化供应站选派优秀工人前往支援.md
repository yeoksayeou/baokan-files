Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 2nd: The large-scale construction project of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is being intensified. So far, more than 114,000 square meters of temporary facilities for affiliated enterprises and new construction and restoration projects in the dormitory area have been completed, and more than 114,000 cubic meters of land have been leveled. The formal factory building project, which began construction successively in July, is now digging foundation pits, transporting soil, pouring concrete, and backfilling soil.

This year, there has been particularly heavy rainfall, and the groundwater level has risen. Water is commonly found in the foundation pits at a depth of about one to two meters, which has caused great difficulties for the project. However, encouraged by their determination to build the motherland's automobile industry, the workers are working day and night, manually digging and lifting water in the absence of electric and manual water pumps. The Chinese Communist Party committee of the mechanical assembly workshop construction site put forward the slogan "Resolutely fight against the rain," and 60% of the CCP members and Communist Youth League members in the construction site responded to the slogan and led all the workers to engage in enthusiastic labor. They persevered in their work with vigor in the rain. Chang Mingyu, the director of the work area, also personally went down to the deep, cement-filled pit to dig mud continuously for five or six hours. A labor emulation campaign was launched at the carpentry workshop construction site. Workers and technicians researched a method of using a movable iron bucket bottom to load mud and extract soil, which increased the soil extraction efficiency by more than two times. The woodworking mold group improved the operation method, increasing efficiency by one time.

During the days when the project encountered difficulties, the arrival of the chief consultant, Soviet expert Shigachev, played a huge role in the project. He proposed many ways to improve work efficiency, such as draining the foundation pits, transporting soil, and sending water pumps by flatbed truck, and solved relevant technical problems, enabling the project to proceed according to the design. So far, the foundation project of the carpentry workshop has been basically completed, and the foundation excavation project of the auxiliary workshop and mechanical assembly workshop has completed about one-third or one-quarter, and concrete is being poured. The quality of these projects generally meets the standards. The foundation excavation project of the non-ferrous metal casting workshop is being intensified. Earth-moving machines are running back and forth on the construction site, and the workers are working hard. Two months ago, it was still a wilderness overgrown with weeds, but now hundreds of foundation pillars have been built. In order to speed up the completion of the factory construction task, in addition to striving to complete the foundation projects that have already started this year before the ground freezes, part of the project that should be completed this year will also be prepared for winter construction, and some prefabricated parts needed for next year's project will also be prepared for prefabrication in winter. The preparation work for winter construction is now being actively planned.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, September 2nd: The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Mechanized Supply Station has selected 47 outstanding technical workers to support the construction project of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. Most of these technical workers are excavator drivers. They have participated in the mechanized construction of key projects such as large-scale rolling mills, seamless steel pipe plants, thin plate rolling plants, and design buildings. They are very skilled in operating technology and can generally operate various construction machinery such as excavation, hoisting, and transportation. For example, the famous excavator driver Guan Yong'an can excavate soil three to four times per minute (half a cubic meter each time).

When these technical workers heard that they were going to support the construction project of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, they all happily accepted this glorious task. Excavator driver Li Dexiang said: "This is a major project that Chairman Mao deeply cares about. We feel very honored to be able to go there to support it!" They all expressed that after arriving at the work site, they will definitely give full play to the power of mechanical construction, ensure the completion of the work task, selflessly teach their skills to others, help the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant train a group of drivers to operate special machinery, and ensure that they learn humbly and constantly improve their skills, and bring construction experience back to Anshan.

    第一汽车制造厂建厂工程加紧施工
    鞍钢机械化供应站选派优秀工人前往支援
    【新华社沈阳二日电】规模宏大的第一汽车制造厂建厂工程正在加紧进行。到目前为止，附属企业暂设工程、宿舍区新建和恢复工程已作好十一万四千多平方公尺，平土方十一万四千多公尺。七月开始相继开工的正式厂屋工程，正在挖土坑，运土，浇注混凝土，回填土等。
    今年雨水特别多，地下水位上升，地坑挖至一公尺左右或两公尺以下普遍见水，给工程造成了很大困难。但是，工人们为建设祖国汽车工业的决心所鼓舞，昼夜不息地在电动抽水机、手掀抽水机不足的情况下用人工挖泥提水。机械装配工场工地的中共党委提出“坚决和雨水作斗争”的口号，占该工地工人总数百分之六十的中共党员和青年团员都响应口号带领全体工人投入热烈的劳动中，在雨水中精神抖擞，坚持干活。工区主任常明裕也亲自下到水泥混浊的深坑中连续挖泥五六小时。木工场工地开展了劳动竞赛，工人和技术人员研究出用活动铁桶底装泥取土办法，使取土效率提高二倍以上，木模组改进了操作方法，效率提高一倍。
    在工程发生困难的日子里，这个厂的总顾问苏联专家希格乔夫的到来，对工程起了巨大作用。他提出地坑排水、运土、平车递送水泵等许多提高工作效率的办法，解决了有关技术问题，使工程能按设计进行。到目前为止，木工场基础工程基本完成，辅助工场、机械装配工场基础挖土工程完成三分之一或四分之一左右，并进行浇注混凝土。这些工程的质量一般都达到了标准。有色金属铸件工场基础挖土工程正在加紧进行。工地上装土机来往奔驰，工人们紧张地劳动。两月前还是杂草丛生的旷野，现在数以百计的基础支柱已兴建起来。为加速完成建厂任务，除今年已开始的基础工程要争取在上冻前完成外，今年应完成的工程并准备进行冬季施工，明年工程需要的一部分预制品也准备在冬季预制，现在冬季施工的准备工作正在积极筹备中。
    【新华社鞍山二日电】鞍山钢铁公司机械化供应站挑选出四十七个优秀的技术工人，支援第一汽车制造厂的建厂工程。这批技术工人大部分是挖土机司机，他们参加过大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、薄板轧制厂和设计大楼等重点工程的机械化施工，操作技术很熟练，一般都能操纵挖土、起重、运输等各种施工机械。如有名的挖土机司机关永安，每分钟能挖土三次到四次（每次半立方公尺）。
    这些技术工人听到要去支援第一汽车制造厂建设工程时，个个都兴高采烈地接受了这个光荣的任务。挖土机司机李德祥说：“这是毛主席深切关怀的大工程，我们能到那里去支援，感到非常光荣！”他们一致表示，到工作现场后，一定发挥机械施工的威力，保证完成工作任务，把自己的技术无私地教给别人，帮助第一汽车制造厂培养一批驾驶特种机械的司机，并保证虚心学习和不断提高自己的技术，把施工经验带回鞍山来。
