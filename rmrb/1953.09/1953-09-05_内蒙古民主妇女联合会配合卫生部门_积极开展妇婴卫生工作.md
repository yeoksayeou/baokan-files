    The Inner Mongolia Democratic Women's Federation (hereinafter referred to as the Women's Federation) actively assists health departments in carrying out maternal and child health work.
    Before liberation, the people of Inner Mongolia suffered greatly from the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Their lives were extremely poor, syphilis and various diseases were very prevalent, the birth rate decreased significantly, and the death rate increased year by year. In the Orunchun ethnic group in the Autonomous Region, the population decreased by 58 percent in twenty-five years, and the infant mortality rate was even more alarming. In Ujila Village in the former Jerim League, the infant mortality rate was as high as 57 percent. Since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, people's living standards have risen year by year, and people generally feel the pain of a shortage of population. The phrases "Fewer people at home means less energy for work" and "It's no fun without babies" specifically reflect the thinking of the people in Inner Mongolia. This sentiment directly affects the production enthusiasm of the local people, especially working women.
    In order to change the above situation, the Central People's Government and the Autonomous Region Health Department actively carried out maternal and child health work in Inner Mongolia, dispatching a large number of experts to go deep into the grasslands to treat diseases for herdsmen. At the same time, syphilis eradication stations, health centers, and health care stations were established in Inner Mongolia; old midwives were reformed, new birth attendants were trained, and midwifery groups were established. According to statistics, the number of reformed old midwives in 1952 increased by 18 percent compared with 1950, and the number of new-style birth attendants increased by 13 percent. Tongliao County alone set up 107 midwifery kits (containing medical equipment for midwifery, specifically for the use of birth attendants) and 57 midwifery groups, accepting 1,124 prenatal examinations for women and conducting 2,161 new-style deliveries.
    Women's federations in various parts of Inner Mongolia have actively cooperated with health departments in maternal and child health work. As early as 1949, the Inner Mongolia Women's Federation called on women cadres working in minority areas to learn medical and health knowledge. In order to enable women cadres to master maternal and child health knowledge, the Women's Federation organized training classes for women cadres. The former Huna League Women's Federation held a cadre training class focusing on maternal and child health, and the trainees were mostly women cadres at the district level. After receiving training, women cadres returned to various places and became active organizers and promoters of health work. For example, many herding women in Inner Mongolia did not pay attention to hygiene during menstruation and were not accustomed to using sanitary belts. Women's Federation cadres went deep into pastoral areas with herdsmen to explain menstrual hygiene knowledge to herding women and helped herding women sew sanitary belts.
    In carrying out maternal and child health work, Women's Federation cadres encountered many difficulties. For example, when Ju Lihenu Tuuk in the Right Front Banner held a new-style midwifery training class, it was opposed by some old midwives. Local Women's Federation cadres conducted explanations and education among the masses and mobilized active members of women to participate in the study. Another example is when Chen Barag Banner carried out syphilis eradication work, many women had concerns. The local Women's Federation promptly convened a meeting of women representatives to first dispel their concerns. The syphilis eradication work was quickly launched among the masses. Women's federations in various parts of Inner Mongolia also combined the central work of each period to carry out publicity work on maternal and child health. The Inner Mongolia Democratic Women's Federation regularly conducted maternal and child health education for women through the "Inner Mongolia Women's News"; it often compiled maternal and child health pamphlets and widely distributed them among herdsmen; at the Nadaam material exchange conference, the Women's Federation also held maternal and child health publicity sheds or held women's health seminars.
    Maternal and child health work has brought happiness to the people of Inner Mongolia. In recent years, the growth rate of infants in Inner Mongolia has increased significantly. On the vast Mongolian grasslands, it is often possible to see strong mothers cuddling chubby children, and laughter from fathers teasing their children is often heard in yurts. In Ujila Village in the former Jerim League, the infant mortality rate was as high as 57 percent. Since the promotion of the new midwifery method, the infant mortality rate has been reduced to 3.8 percent. Liu Guihua, a birth attendant in the Eighth District of Balingzuo Banner, Zhaowuda League, delivered 56 children after learning the new midwifery method, and none of them died. A woman named Ulijin, who is 32 years old this year, had never had a child after marriage. Recently, she was cured of syphilis and gave birth to a fat, white baby. Liu Xing, a herdsman in Ju Lihenu Tuuk, Right Front Banner, had given birth to six children in the past, but all died due to postpartum fever. The seventh child survived because of the new midwifery method and is now more than one year old.

### 内蒙古民主妇女联合会配合卫生部门  积极开展妇婴卫生工作

    内蒙古民主妇女联合会配合卫生部门
    积极开展妇婴卫生工作
    内蒙古民主妇女联合会（以下简称妇联），积极协助卫生部门开展妇婴卫生工作。
    内蒙古人民在解放以前饱受帝国主义、国民党反动派的压迫，生活极为贫困，梅毒和各种疾病十分流行，生育率显著降低，死亡率逐年增加。自治区鄂伦春族二十五年中人口减少达百分之五十八，婴儿死亡率更是惊人，原哲里木盟的乌吉拉村以前的婴孩死亡率竟达百分之五十七。自内蒙古自治区成立后，群众的生活水平逐年上升，人们普遍感到人口缺少的痛苦。“家里人少干活没有劲”、“没有娃娃没意思”这两句话，具体地反映了内蒙地区人民的思想情况。这种情绪直接影响了当地群众，特别是劳动妇女的生产积极性。
    为了改变上述情况，中央人民政府和自治区卫生部在内蒙地区积极开展了妇婴卫生工作，派遣大批专家，深入草地为牧民治病。同时，在内蒙地区建立了驱除梅毒站、卫生院、保健站；改造旧产婆，训练新接生员，成立了接生小组。据统计，一九五二年经改造的旧产婆较一九五○年增加了百分之十八，新式接生员增加了百分之十三，仅通辽县就设置了一百零七个接生箱（里面放着接生用的医药器材，专供接生员使用）、五十七个接生组，接受妇女产前检查达一千一百二十四次，进行新式接生二千一百六十一次。
    内蒙各地妇联在妇婴卫生工作方面对卫生部门积极地进行了配合。远在一九四九年，内蒙古妇联就号召在少数民族地区工作的妇女干部要学习医学卫生常识。为了使妇女干部掌握妇婴卫生常识，妇联组织曾举办了妇女干部训练班。原呼纳盟妇联曾举办了以学习妇婴卫生为主的干部训练班，训练的对象大部分是区一级的妇联干部。受过训练的妇女干部，回到各地后，就成为卫生工作的积极组织者和宣传者。例如，内蒙地区许多牧民妇女在月经期间不注意卫生，不习惯用月经带，妇联的干部就随着牧民深入牧区向牧民妇女讲解经期卫生常识，并帮助牧民妇女缝制月经带。
    在开展妇婴卫生工作中，妇联干部曾遇到不少的困难。例如，科右前旗居里很努图克在举办新式接生训练班时，曾遭到一部分旧产婆的反对，当地妇联干部便在群众中进行解释、教育，并动员妇女中的积极分子参加学习。又如陈巴尔虎旗在开展驱除梅毒工作时，妇女群众发生了很多顾虑，当地妇联就及时召开了妇女代表会议，首先使她们打破顾虑。驱除梅毒工作很快就在群众中展开了。内蒙各地妇联还结合各个时期的中心工作，开展了妇婴卫生的宣传工作，内蒙古民主妇女联合会通过“内蒙古妇女报”，经常对妇女群众进行妇婴卫生教育；经常编译妇婴卫生小册子，在牧民中广泛发行；在那达慕物资交流大会上，妇联还举办妇婴卫生宣传棚，或举行妇女卫生座谈会。
    妇婴卫生工作给内蒙古人民带来了幸福。近年来，内蒙古婴儿的成长率有了显著的提高。在辽阔的蒙古草原上，经常可以看见健壮的母亲偎依着肥胖的孩子，蒙古包里经常传出爸爸逗弄自己孩子的欢笑声。原哲里木盟的乌吉拉村以前婴儿死亡率达百分之五十七，自推广新接生法后，婴儿的死亡率降低到百分之三点八。昭乌达盟巴林左旗八区接生员刘桂花学习新接生法后，曾接生了五十六个孩子，没有一个死亡。妇女乌力金，今年三十二岁，婚后没有生过孩子，最近她治好了梅毒，生了又胖又白的娃娃。科右前旗居里很努图克牧民刘兴，过去曾生过六个小孩，因四六风都死去了，第七个孩子因用新式接生活下来了，现在已有一岁多了。
