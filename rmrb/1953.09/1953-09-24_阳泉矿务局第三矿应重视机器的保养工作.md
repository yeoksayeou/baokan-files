    Yangquan Mining Bureau's Third Mine Should Emphasize Machine Maintenance

    A letter from Gao Dongsheng of the Industry Department of the CPC Yangquan Municipal Committee: The Third Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau seriously neglects the maintenance of mining machinery. Last winter, they piled up many new machines in the open air. Because these machines have been unattended for eight or nine months, exposed to wind, sun, and rain, they are now extremely rusty; some machines are even submerged in accumulated water, and a 75-horsepower endless rope winch is almost buried by weeds. As for other parts, such as iron plates and coal chute troughs, they are piled up everywhere. A shaper that the mine transported back from the Northeast at the beginning of July was also placed in the open air. It wasn't until late July that a temporary shed was built, with a few iron plates on top and some wooden boards around the sides. Because the shed roof leaked, the machine tool now has two rusty spots, and the base of the machine body is soaking in water.

    As far as I understand, all mines under the Yangquan Mining Bureau have similar situations. Such behavior of not cherishing state property cannot be allowed. The Yangquan Mining Bureau should immediately take effective measures to inspect and change this situation.

    阳泉矿务局第三矿应重视机器的保养工作
    中共阳泉市委会工业部高东升来信：阳泉矿务局第三矿严重忽视矿山机器的保养工作。去冬，他们把好些新机器堆积在露天地里。这些机器因为八、九个月来无人照管，任凭风吹、日晒和雨淋，现在都已锈得不像样了；有的机器就在积水中淹着，一部七十五马力无极绳车已快被野草掩埋起来了。至于其他的零件，如铁板、煤镏子槽等，更是到处堆积。今年七月初该矿从东北运回来的一部牛头刨床，也被放在露天地上，直到七月下旬才临时搭了个棚，顶上盖了几块铁板，四面围上些木板。因为棚顶漏雨，现在机床已有两处生锈，机身底座也在水里泡着。
    据我了解，阳泉矿务局所属各矿都有类似情况。这种不爱护国家财产的行为，是不能允许的。阳泉矿务局应该立即采取有效措施，检查和改变这种情况。
