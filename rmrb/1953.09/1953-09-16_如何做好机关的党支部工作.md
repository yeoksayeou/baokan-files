    How to Do a Good Job of the Party Branch Work in Government Offices
    Zhang Weizhen, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs Committee

    Editor's Note: With the advent of planned economic construction in the country, the issue of strengthening the work of Party branches in government offices has attracted attention. The reason is, as this article mentions: the majority of Party members in Party and state organs are cadres, and they are the leading backbone of state organs. Strengthening their Party life and Party supervision is of great significance for the successful completion of the great economic construction, cultural construction, and other construction work. Although there is no mature experience on how to do a good job of Party branch work in government offices, various localities have explored some preliminary experiences. If these preliminary experiences are collected, studied, and discussed, it may be possible to summarize more mature experiences. This publishes Comrade Zhang Weizhen's article from the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs Party Committee for everyone's study. We hope that everyone will offer opinions or write about their experiences and problems in their work, and we will continue to publish them.

    Since the "Three-Anti" Movement, especially after the Party Congress of the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs last year, the work of Party branches in the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs has made great progress. This is mainly reflected in: First, strengthening the leadership of cadres' learning, inspiring the learning enthusiasm and consciousness of the majority of cadres, adhering to the learning system, and initially exploring the preliminary experience of leading learning, thereby improving the theoretical level and policy level of cadres. Second, tightening the Party's organizational life, adhering to the Party Day activity system, and gradually carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Third, initially overcoming the erroneous thinking of some Party member cadres who do not attach importance to the work of Party branches in government offices and believe that doing Party branch work in government offices is an "extra burden," and improving the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of Party member cadres for the work of Party branches in government offices. However, there are still many shortcomings in the branch work of the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs, such as the fact that criticism and self-criticism is not carried out frequently and extensively enough, and the theoretical learning guidance work cannot keep up with the learning needs of cadres, etc. These must be improved. Based on our experience in this work, we believe that in order to do a good job of Party branch work in government offices, we must pay attention to solving the following four problems:

    I. To do a good job of Party branch work in government offices, we must first clearly understand the tasks of Party branches in government offices. Because only by clearly understanding our work tasks can we correctly carry out our work. Otherwise, a random grab will not get the job done.

    In the past, there were inconsistent understandings of the tasks of Party branches in government offices. In the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs, some people believed that "Party branches in government offices should have the power to supervise administrative work, just like Party branches in factories and enterprises in production units. Otherwise, guaranteeing the completion of administrative tasks is empty talk." Others believed that "to ensure the completion of administrative tasks, Party branches should discuss administrative work plans, discuss specific businesses, and check the implementation of administrative plans, etc." These statements are all wrong. They do not understand the nature of Party branches in government offices and the special conditions of their activities, and they confuse Party branch work in government offices with administrative work.

    Regarding this issue, Comrade Zhdanov gave clear instructions in the report on revising the Party Constitution at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). He said: "Some people propose to give the branches of Soviet institutions the same supervisory powers as those given to production branches. I think this proposal is unacceptable, because its starting point is to forget the special conditions of the activities of the branches of Soviet institutions." "The characteristic of the activities of the branches of Soviet institutions is that, in essence, they cannot bear the function of supervising the work of Soviet institutions—this function of supervision belongs to higher Party organs and Soviet institutions." At the same time, he pointed out: "This is a model of confusing the most basic concept of the tasks of the branches of Soviet institutions." This is because: All levels of government offices are leading organizations for national management of production, enterprises, schools, medical and health institutions, and national political organs, etc. They work under the leadership and supervision of higher-level leading organs or corresponding-level Party leadership. Therefore, the Party branches in government offices cannot supervise administrative management like Party branches in factories and enterprises in production units. At the same time, the work of Party branches in government offices is political work and organizational work, and the work of Party branches in government offices cannot be confused with administrative work. Therefore, it is not necessary for Party branches to discuss administrative work plans and check the implementation of administrative plans. Because Party members of Party branches in government offices are members of government offices, they understand the intentions of administrative work; even if they do not understand certain work, the branch secretary can participate in relevant administrative meetings and arrange branch work according to the intentions of administrative leaders. The responsibility of Party branches in government offices is "to remind attention to defects in the work of government offices, point out shortcomings in the work of government offices and individual staff members, and submit their understanding and opinions to the Party organizations and leaders of the organs to which they belong" ("Party Organizations in Soviet Institutions," published on page 3 of the "People's Daily" on June 20, 1953).

    In order to clearly recognize the tasks of Party branches in government offices, the Party Congress of the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs last year conducted in-depth discussions based on the instructions of Comrade Li Changqing, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. After this meeting, it was basically clear that the tasks of Party branches in government offices are—Party branches in government offices mainly guarantee the completion of administrative tasks, and their regular and important work is: First, to do a good job of learning among Party members and non-Party staff in government offices; Second, to carry out criticism and self-criticism and fight against all bad tendencies. It is wrong to talk about guaranteeing the completion of administrative tasks without leaving these two tasks or not actively doing these two tasks well. Of course, other work must also be done well (such as developing and educating new Party members, reviewing and appraising Party members, leading mass organizations, and doing a good job of the lives and welfare of government offices, etc.), but it is also wrong to not distinguish between primary and secondary tasks and use strength equally. That is to say, to ensure the completion of administrative tasks, Party branches in government offices must not only directly mobilize Party members and the masses to complete an administrative task when it arrives, but also tightly grasp and do the following two tasks well:

    First, we must continuously improve the political theory, policy and ideological level, and business ability of Party members and non-Party staff. Therefore, organizing and leading the study of political theory, current affairs policies, business and technical knowledge (the study of business and technical knowledge is led by administrative leaders, and the branch should organize and urge Party members and non-Party staff to actively participate in the study), and cultural knowledge for Party and non-Party staff in government offices, especially the study of theory and policies, has become one of the primary tasks of Party branches in government offices. As Comrade Stalin taught us: "The higher the political level and the degree of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff in any department of state work and Party work, the higher the work itself, the more effective it is, and the more effective the results of the work" ("Problems of Leninism," Moscow edition, page 782). Therefore, if Party branches in government offices abandon or relax the leadership of learning in government offices, it is actually equivalent to abandoning branch work; strengthening the leadership of learning in government offices by the branch is also equivalent to strengthening political and ideological leadership by the branch. Improving the theoretical policy and cultural level and business ability of Party member cadres in government offices can directly promote the completion of administrative tasks.

    Second, to continuously improve the political awareness and ideological level of Party members and non-Party staff, it is also necessary to improve and tighten the internal political life and Party organizational life of government offices, regularly promote democracy inside and outside the Party, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and fight against various bad tendencies. This is also one of the important tasks of Party branches in government offices. Comrade Stalin once said: "If we do not point out and expose the shortcomings and errors in our work with the open and sincere attitude that Bolsheviks should have, we will cut off our own road to progress." ("Summary Report on the Political Work of the Central Committee at the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)") That is to say, only by regularly conducting criticism and self-criticism, exposing and overcoming shortcomings and errors in our work, can our work move forward and the revolutionary cause develop. Therefore, Party branches in government offices should actively and earnestly criticize all non-proletarian ideas, oppose bureaucracy and procrastination in government offices, and resolutely fight against phenomena that violate state laws, Party policies, and various systems of government offices. Only by eliminating the influence of the above ideas and bad work styles can we more effectively guarantee the completion of administrative tasks.

    In short, whether Party branches in government offices can organize and lead the study of Party member cadres in government offices well, and whether they can regularly and earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism and wage a resolute struggle against bad tendencies, is one of the signs of the quality of the work of Party branches in government offices.

    II. To do a good job of Party branch work in government offices, we must also ideologically clearly recognize the importance of Party branch work in government offices to enhance the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of Party member cadres for Party branch work in government offices; without this ideological foundation, it is impossible to do a good job of Party branch work in government offices.

    The work of Party branches in government offices is important because: On the one hand, the majority of Party members in Party branches in government offices are cadres, they are the leading backbone of the revolution, and they are the leaders of state organs. Strengthening their Party life and Party supervision is of great significance for the successful completion of the great national economic construction, cultural construction, and other construction tasks; on the other hand, leading organs are head organs, like command headquarters. To win a battle, we must first do a good job of the command headquarters. Without a sound command headquarters, we cannot successfully complete combat tasks. That is to say, the quality of work in leading organs not only affects the work within government offices, but also affects the work of the entire province, county, and district. From this, we can see the importance of the work of Party branches in government offices.

    However, many Party member cadres in our government offices do not recognize this, but instead believe that Party branches in government offices are dispensable, or regard doing Party branch work in government offices as an "extra burden." To correct this erroneous thinking, the Party Congress of the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs criticized these erroneous ideas; each branch also conducted inspections on this when implementing the resolutions of the Party Congress, thereby improving the ideological understanding of Party member cadres and enhancing their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for Party branch work in government offices. There is also an ideological bias in government offices, that is, many Party member cadres lack confidence in doing a good job of Party branch work in government offices. They believe that "Party branch work in government offices is very important, but their level is not much different from that of other comrades, and they cannot lead." In response to this idea, the Party organization of the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs clarified the favorable conditions for doing a good job of Party branch work in government offices to increase everyone's work confidence. The favorable conditions for Party branches in government offices are: Party branches in government offices are close to leading organs and carry out work under the close care and specific leadership of higher-level Party committees, which is an extremely favorable condition for the work of Party branches in government offices; second, there are many Party members in Party branches in government offices who have been tempered, have a strong Party spirit, and hold leadership positions in administration. Their struggle experience is rich, and their political theory level is relatively high. As long as the branch earnestly organizes them, uses them, and gives play to their strength, this will have a great effect on improving the work level of Party branches in government offices; third, Party branches in government offices are relatively concentrated, and it is more convenient to conduct timely and in-depth inspections of work and provide specific guidance.

    It is undeniable that some Party members still do not have enough understanding of the importance of Party branch work in government offices and are still unwilling to participate in branch work actively or lack confidence in doing Party branch work in government offices; some comrades also participate in branch work, but this is only organizational obedience (they have to do it), and the idea of consciously and voluntarily doing a good job of Party branch work in government offices has not been fully established. Therefore, we must continue to work hard and continue to carry out criticism and education to overcome these erroneous ideological tendencies.

    III. To do a good job of Party branch work in government offices, we must also strengthen unified and centralized activities, which is an important link in improving the work level of Party branches in government offices. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in "On the Party": "The Party Constitution stipulates that in a factory, mine, village, enterprise, street, government office, and school, no matter how many Party members there are, from three Party members to thousands of Party members, only one unified Party organization is established to become the basic organization of the Party... The basic organization of the Party is generally called the Party branch, and specially called the Party general branch or the Party committee of the factory, government office, or school. Within the Party branch, the method of organizing Party members into several groups should be adopted, which is somewhat convenient for work and has some effect, but the role of the group should not be overemphasized, and many tasks should not be decentralized to the group to carry out. Instead, the branch should carry out the work in a unified and centralized manner. Only those tasks that are inconvenient for the branch to carry out in a centralized manner should be decentralized to the group to carry out." The Party Congress of the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs studied this. Practice has also proved that this activity method is scientific and effective. For example: The Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs organize cadres to study political theory. The Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs Party Committee uniformly stipulates the learning content, learning steps, and learning methods, and concentrates on lecturing, tutoring, and answering difficult questions, which has a relatively large effect. When conducting basic knowledge education of the Party, the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs Party Committee uniformly organized the study and concentrated on giving lectures, which was welcomed by Party members, and the learning effect was also good.

    However, many Party general branches and branches in Songjiang Province are still not good at using this unified and centralized activity method and push many tasks to branch branches (or groups) to carry out. For example, the Finance Department general branch has only held two Party member congresses in the past year (some improvements have been made recently), pushing many tasks that should be carried out by the general branch in a unified and centralized manner to branch branches. The general branch committee also rarely holds meetings to study work and does not have a unified work plan, so the general branch forms an administrative organ that issues orders and transfers information, and the work becomes a formality. Experience has proved that strengthening the unified and centralized activities of Party organizations in government offices has the advantage of not only guaranteeing the quality of work, but also saving manpower. For a department, the leadership strength and leadership level of the general branch are generally stronger than those of the branch branch, and the branch is stronger than the group. Therefore, organizing lectures, reports, and conveying the instructions and resolutions of higher-level Party organizations by the general branch (or branch) in a unified and centralized manner can guarantee quality, and the effect is also good; on the contrary, decentralizing them to branch branches (or groups) to carry out will not only fail to guarantee quality, but will also produce errors. On the other hand, for work that can be carried out in a unified and centralized manner within a general branch, the general branch committee can conduct research and discussion and have one person make a report or convey the information; while decentralizing it to branch branches to carry out requires each branch branch committee to conduct research and discussion and requires several people to make reports or convey the information, which appears to be distracting and wasting manpower.

    IV. To do a good job of Party branch work in government offices, the higher-level Party committee and the administrative side of government offices must attach importance to the work of the branch and provide leadership and support, and at the same time improve and equip the professional institutions and full-time cadres of the Party committee and branches in government offices, which is one of the important conditions for doing a good job of branch work in government offices.

    The Songjiang Provincial Party Committee attaches great importance to the work of Party branches in government offices. Comrade Li Changqing, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, gave clear instructions on the tasks of Party branches in government offices at the Party Congress of the Provincial Direct Organs. In leading the study of cadres in government offices, the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee took the lead in studying, adhered to the study system, and gave the Party committee many specific instructions, which improved the enthusiasm and consciousness of cadres in government offices. The great achievements made in the eight-month middle and primary political theory education in Songjiang Province are inseparable from the great importance and support of the Provincial Party Committee. In carrying out criticism, the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee also gave strong support, especially to the criticism and handling of the shortcomings and errors of certain heads of government offices by the branch, which was highly valued and supported, thus also improving the enthusiasm and confidence of comrades working in the Party committee and branches of government offices. In addition, after the "Three-Anti" Movement, the Provincial Party Committee transferred some cadres to enrich the institutions of the Party committee of government offices, so that the daily work of the Party in government offices was studied and handled by specialists, so that the work of Party branches in government offices could be carried out smoothly. The same is true in a department. The Party members responsible for administration must attach importance to it and give timely guidance in order to do a good job of branch work. Comrade Zhang Zhongmin, Director of the Songjiang Provincial Taxation Bureau, can often participate in branch activities and give guidance. Later, he was elected as the branch secretary and can often give reports on learning and ideological cultivation to Party members and cadres; to meet the needs of work, he also drew a cadre from the administrative establishment to specialize in the work of the Party branch. Thanks to the importance and strong support of the leaders, the branch work of the Taxation Bureau is relatively well done.

    Experience has proved that whenever the leaders attach importance to and strongly support it, the work of Party branches in government offices will improve, and the work effect will be good; conversely, if the leaders do not attach importance to it and do not support it, and even some people find branch work troublesome and annoying, then the work of Party branches in government offices will definitely not be done well.

    如何做好机关的党支部工作
    中共松江省直属机关委员会副书记  张伟振
    编者按：随着国家有计划经济建设的到来，加强机关党的支部工作的问题已引起大家注意。其原因就如这篇文章所提到的：党和国家的机关中的支部成员极大部分是干部，他们是国家机关的领导骨干，而对他们加强党的生活和党的监督，对于胜利完成伟大的经济建设和文化建设及其它建设工作具有重大的意义。目前虽然对于如何做好机关党的支部工作还没有一套成熟的经验，但是各地也已摸索出一些初步经验，如把这些初步经验汇集起来，加以研究讨论，就可能总结出比较成熟的经验。这里发表松江省直属机关党委员会张伟振同志的文章，供大家研究。希望大家提出意见或把自己工作中的经验和问题写出来，我们将继续发表。
    松江省直属机关的党支部工作在“三反”运动特别是在去年的机关党员代表大会之后，是有很大进步的。这主要表现在：首先是加强了对机关干部学习的领导，启发了大多数干部的学习热情和自觉性，坚持了学习制度，并已摸索到领导学习的初步经验，从而提高了干部理论水平和政策水平。其次是严密了党内组织生活，坚持了党日活动制度，逐步开展了批评与自我批评。再次是初步克服了某些党员干部不重视机关支部工作及认为做机关支部工作是“额外负担”的错误思想，而提高了党员干部对机关支部工作的积极性和责任心。但是松江省直属机关支部工作中还存在许多缺点，如批评与自我批评开展还不够经常和广泛，理论学习辅导工作还跟不上干部学习需要等等。这是必须加以改进的。根据我们在这一段工作中的体验，认为要做好机关的党支部工作，必须注意解决以下四个问题：
    一、要做好机关的党支部工作，首先必须明确认识机关的党支部的任务。因为只有明确认识自己的工作任务后，才能正确地进行自己的工作。否则，乱抓一阵是不能把工作做好的。
    过去对于机关支部的任务认识上是不一致的，在松江省直属机关中，就有人认为“机关支部应当像工厂企业生产单位中党的支部一样，对行政工作负有监督权。否则，保证行政任务完成是空话”。也有人认为“要保证行政任务的完成，党的支部就要讨论行政工作计划，讨论具体业务及检查行政计划执行情况等等”。这些说法都是错误的，不了解机关支部的性质及其活动的特殊条件，并把机关支部工作和行政工作混淆起来。
    关于这个问题，日丹诺夫同志在联共（布）第十八次代表大会上所作修改党章报告中给了明确的指示。他说：“有人提议像给予生产支部一样也给予苏维埃机关支部以监督权。我想，这种提议是不能接受的，因为它的出发点是忘记了苏维埃机关支部活动底特殊条件。”“苏维埃机关支部活动底特点就是：它在实质上不能负有监督苏维埃机关工作的职能，——这种监督的职能是属于上级党机关和苏维埃机关。”同时他又指出：“这是把苏维埃机关支部任务底起码概念弄得混淆不清的标本。”这是因为：各级机关是国家管理生产、企业、学校、医务卫生机关以及国家政治机关等等的领导机构，它们是在高一级领导机关或与它相适应的同级党的领导和监督之下进行工作的。因此，各级机关中党的支部，便不能与工厂企业生产单位中党的支部那样，对行政管理进行监督。同时，机关党的支部工作是政治工作与组织工作，不能把机关党的支部工作与行政工作混淆起来。因此，支部讨论行政工作计划，检查行政计划执行情况等做法是不需要的。因为机关支部的党员是机关成员之一，他是了解行政工作意图的；即使某些工作不了解，由支部书记参加有关行政会议，并根据行政领导意图，布置支部工作就可以了。机关党的支部的责任“在于提醒注意机关工作中的缺陷，指出机关及其个别工作人员工作中的缺点，并把自己所了解的情况和意见提交所属的党组织和机关领导人”（“苏维埃机关的党组织”，载一九五三年六月二十日“人民日报”第三版）。
    为了明确认识机关支部的任务，去年松江省直属机关党员代表大会上，曾根据省委书记李常青同志的指示，进行了深入的讨论。经过这次会议，基本上明确认识了机关党支部的工作任务——机关支部主要是保证行政任务的完成，其经常的重要工作就是：第一、把机关党员与非党工作人员的学习搞好；第二、开展批评与自我批评，向一切不良倾向作斗争。如果离开这两项工作或不去积极地做好这两项工作，而空谈保证行政任务的完成是不对的。当然，其它工作亦要做好（如发展与教育新党员，审查与鉴定党员，领导群众组织及搞好机关生活福利等），但不分主次，平均使用力量也是不对的。这就是说，机关支部要保证行政任务的完成，除一个行政任务到来时直接动员党员和群众去完成外，还必须紧紧地掌握并做好以下两项工作：
    首先，必须不断地提高党员与非党工作人员的政治理论、政策思想水平及业务能力。因此，组织和领导机关党与非党工作人员的政治理论、时事政策、业务技术知识（业务技术知识的学习由行政领导，支部要组织与督促党员与非党工作人员积极参加学习）及文化知识的学习，特别是理论政策学习，就成为机关党的支部首要工作之一。正如斯大林同志教导我们的那样：“在国家工作和党工作任何一个部门中，工作人员底政治水准和马列主义觉悟程度愈高，工作本身也愈高，愈有成效，工作底结果也愈有效力”（“列宁主义问题”，莫斯科版第七八二页）。因此，机关党的支部如果放弃或放松了对机关的学习领导，实际上就等于放弃了支部工作；支部加强了对机关学习的领导，也就是支部增强了政治思想领导。提高了机关党员干部的理论政策、文化水平及业务能力，也就可直接推动行政任务的完成。
    其次，要不断地提高党员与非党工作人员的政治觉悟和思想水平，还要健全与严密机关内部的政治生活和党的组织生活，经常地发扬党内外民主，进行批评与自我批评并和各种不良倾向作斗争，这也是机关党的支部重要工作之一。斯大林同志曾讲过：“我们若不以布尔什维克所应有的公开诚恳态度指出和揭露我们工作中的缺点和错误，我们就会断绝自己前进的道路。”（“在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告”）这就是说，我们只有经常地进行批评与自我批评，揭发并克服工作中的缺点和错误，工作才能前进，革命事业才能发展。因此，机关党的支部应该积极而又认真地去批判一切非无产阶级思想，反对机关中的官僚主义和拖拉作风，以及和违反国家法令、党的政策及机关各种制度的现象进行坚决的斗争。只有清除以上思想影响及不良作风，才能更有效地保证行政任务的完成。
    总之，机关党的支部能否组织与领导好机关党员干部学习，能否经常地和认真地开展批评与自我批评并向不良倾向作坚决的斗争，是机关党的支部工作好坏的标志之一。
    二、要做好机关党的支部工作，还必须在思想上明确认识到机关党的支部工作的重要性，以增强党员干部对机关支部工作的积极性和责任心；没有这个思想基础是不能把机关支部工作做好的。
    机关的党支部工作所以重要，是因为：一方面机关支部的成员极大部分是干部，他们是革命的领导骨干，是国家机关的领导人员，而对他们加强党的生活和党的监督，对于胜利完成伟大的国家经济建设和文化建设及其它建设任务是有着重大意义的；另一方面领导机关是首脑机关，如同司令部，要打胜仗，首先要把司令部搞好，没有健全的司令部是不能胜利地完成战斗任务的。这就是说，领导机关工作的好坏，不仅影响机关内部的工作，而且影响到全省、全县、全区的工作。由此可以看出机关党的支部工作的重要性。
    然而，在我们机关里有不少的党员干部并不是这样认识的，而是认为机关支部是可有可无，或者是把做机关支部工作当作是“额外负担”。为了端正这种错误思想，松江省直属机关党代表大会上曾批判了这些错误思想；各支部在贯彻执行党代表大会决议时，对此也进行了检查，从而提高了党员干部的思想认识，增强了对机关支部工作的积极性责任心。在机关里还有一种思想偏向，就是有不少党员干部对做好机关支部工作缺乏信心，他们认为“机关支部工作是很重要，但自己水平与其它同志相差无几，领导不了。”松江省直属机关的党组织针对这一思想，阐明了做好机关支部工作的有利条件，以提高大家的工作信心。机关支部的有利条件是：机关支部靠近领导机关，在上级党委密切关怀与具体领导下进行工作，这对于机关支部工作是一个极为有利的条件；其次，机关支部里有许多经过锻炼，党性很强并在行政上担任领导工作的党员，他们的斗争经验丰富，政治理论水平较高，支部只要认真地把他们组织起来，运用并发挥他们的力量，这对提高机关党的支部工作水平有很大的作用；第三、机关支部比较集中，及时地深入检查工作，具体指导工作也就较为便利。
    不可否认，目前还有一部分党员对机关党的支部工作重要性还认识不足，仍不愿或不积极地参加支部工作或对做机关支部工作缺乏信心；有些同志虽也参加作支部工作，但这只是组织上的服从（不做不行），而自觉自愿地做好机关支部工作的思想还未完全建立起来。因此，我们必须继续努力，不断进行批判和教育，克服这些错误思想倾向。
    三、要做好机关党的支部工作，又必须加强统一地集中地活动，这是提高机关党的支部工作水平的重要环节。刘少奇同志在“论党”中说：“党章规定：在一个工厂、矿山、农村、企业、街道、机关和学校中，不论党员有多少人，从三个党员起，到几千个党员止，都只成立一个统一的党的组织，成为党的基础组织……党的基础组织，一般称为党的支部，特殊地称为党的总支部或党的工厂、机关、学校委员会。在党的支部之内，将党员编入若干小组的办法，是应该采用的，对工作有些便利，有些作用，但不应该过分强调小组的作用，不应将许多工作分散在小组去进行，而应由支部统一地集中地去进行，只有由支部集中进行不方便的，才分散到小组去进行。”松江省直属机关党代表大会对此作了研究。在实际工作中也已经证明：这种活动方式是科学的、有效的。例如：省直属机关组织干部政治理论学习，由省直属机关党委统一地规定学习内容，学习步骤，学习方法，集中地进行讲授、辅导及解答疑难问题，收效比较大。在进行党的基本知识教育时，由省直属机关党委统一组织学习，集中地进行讲课，受到了党员的欢迎，学习效果也好。
    然而，目前松江省有许多机关党总支部和支部，还不善于运用这种统一集中的活动方式，把许多工作都推到分支部（或小组）去进行。如财政厅总支部一年来仅开过二次党员大会，（最近有些改进）将许多应由总支部统一集中进行的工作，推到分支部去进行，总支部委员会也很少开会研究工作，也没有一个统一的工作计划，所以总支部形成下达上转的事务机关，工作流于形式。经验证明：加强机关党的组织统一地集中地活动的好处，既可保证工作质量，又可节省人力。就一个部门来说，总支部的领导力量和领导水平，一般说是比分支部强，支部比小组强，因而由总支部（或支部）统一地集中地组织讲授，报告会及传达上级党的指示和决议等等，可以保证质量，效果也好；相反，分散到分支部（或小组）去进行，不仅不能保证质量，而且会搞出错误来。另一方面在一个总支部内可以统一地集中地进行的工作，由总支部委员会进行研究讨论并有一人去作报告或传达即可；而分散到分支部去进行，各分支部委员会均要进行研究讨论并要好几个人去作报告或传达，这就显得分散精力，浪费人力。
    四、要做好机关党的支部工作，还须上级党委和机关行政方面重视支部工作并加以领导和支持，同时健全与配备机关党委及支部的专业机构和专职干部，这是做好机关支部工作重要条件之一。
    松江省委对机关党支部的工作是很重视的，省委书记李常青同志在省直属机关党代表大会上曾就机关党的支部工作任务作了明确的指示。在领导机关干部学习中，省委负责同志以身作则带头学习，坚持学习制度，并给党委许多具体指示，这就提高了机关干部的学习积极性和自觉性。松江省直属机关八个多月的中、初级政治理论教育所以获得很大成绩，这是和省委重视大力支持分不开的。在开展批评方面，省委负责同志也是大力支持的，特别是支部对某些机关负责人的缺点和错误的批评和处理是很重视和支持的，因而也提高了机关党委及支部工作同志的积极性和信心。此外，省委在“三反”运动之后，即抽调一些干部充实了机关党委的机构，这样机关党的日常工作有专人研究和处理，使机关党的支部工作得以顺利开展。在一个部门也是如此，必须是行政负责的党员加以重视并给以及时指导，才能把支部工作做好。松江省税务局局长张仲民同志就能经常地参加支部活动并给以指导，以后被选为支部书记，能经常地给党员和干部作有关学习及思想修养方面的报告；为适应工作需要还从行政编制中抽出一名干部专门作党的支部工作。由于领导重视并大力支持，所以税务局支部工作是做得比较好的。
    经验证明：凡是领导重视并大力支持，机关的党支部工作就有起色，工作效果也就好；反之，领导不重视不支持，甚至有的嫌支部工作麻烦、讨厌，那么，机关的党支部工作一定做不好。
