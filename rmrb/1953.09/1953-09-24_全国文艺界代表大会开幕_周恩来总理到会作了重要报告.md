    National Literary and Art Circles Representative Conference Opens
    Premier Zhou Enlai Attends and Delivers Important Report

    The Second National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers grandly opened in Beijing on the morning of the 23rd. In the afternoon, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government attended the conference and delivered an important report.

    This conference is being held at a time when the nation has entered a period of large-scale, planned economic construction. This new historical period requires literary and art workers across the country to actively participate in national construction with their creations, create more excellent literary and artistic works with correct ideological content, and educate and encourage the broad masses of the people with socialist spirit to strive for the gradual realization of national industrialization and the transition to a socialist society.

    Five hundred and sixty official delegates and one hundred and eighty-nine non-voting delegates are participating in this conference. They come from the six major administrative regions of North China, Northeast China, East China, Central South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, broadly representing artists from all fields of literature, drama, film, music, fine arts, dance, and folk art across the country.

    In order to separately discuss creative and organizational issues in various departments of literature and art, the representative conference of literary workers and the enlarged meetings of the national committees of the drama, music, fine arts, and dance associations will be held simultaneously during the conference. In addition, representatives of film and folk art workers, and representatives of literary and art workers' federations from various provinces and cities will hold separate forums.

    At 9:00 a.m., the entire body of delegates unanimously elected Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Ding Ling, Lao She, Xia Yan, Ke Zhongping, Tian Han, Mei Lanfang, Xiao San, Cao Ming, Chen Yi, Xu Beihong, Qi Baishi, Lü Ji, Ma Sicong, Yang Hansheng, Feng Xuefeng, Zheng Zhenduo, Cai Chusheng, Shi Dongshan, Hong Shen, Ouyang Yuqian, Zhao Shuli, Zhou Libo, Liu Baiyu, Shao Quanlin, Sha Ting, A Ying, Yu Heiding, Dai Ailian, Wang Zunsan and 44 others, totaling seventy-six people, to form the presidium of the conference.

    Chairman Guo Moruo delivered the opening address. After describing the unprecedented great changes in the motherland since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the glorious scene of the country entering the first five-year construction period, he said: In the past four years, literature and art have made significant progress and development. This is the result of the efforts of all literary and art workers under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the support and encouragement of the state and the people. However, the progress and development of literary and artistic work still fall far short of the needs of current national construction and the requirements of people's lives.

    Chairman Guo Moruo pointed out: In order to adapt to the needs of national construction and the people in the new historical period, the central task of this conference is to summarize the work experience of the past four years, further develop the creative cause of literature and art, encourage writers and artists to create more and better works, strengthen the closer unity of the literary and art circles, improve the organization of literary and art workers, and improve the leadership of literary and artistic work, so that literary and artistic creation can flourish.

    Chairman Guo Moruo continued: In the process of gradually realizing national industrialization and transitioning to socialism, the needs of the masses of the people for literary and artistic production are constantly growing, both in quality and quantity. Literary and art workers should strive to meet this need of the masses.

    Chairman Guo Moruo called on writers and artists to unite, promote work, realistically and gradually overcome the backwardness of literature and art, so that all departments of literature and art can achieve a bumper harvest and produce works worthy of this great era in mutual competition.

    Next, the guests attending the opening ceremony, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Fu Zhong, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and Stephan Hermlin, Vice Chairman of the German Writers' Association, who was invited to visit our country, spoke at the meeting.

    Lai Ruoyu said: During the period of national construction, the production labor and class struggle of the working class should be the most important source of material for literary and artistic creation, and the working masses should also be the main readers or viewers of literary and artistic creation. He hoped that literary and art workers would: first of all, use communist thought to educate and influence the working masses and help them become more united and more improved; at the same time, educate workers and peasants on the worker-peasant alliance.

    In his speech, Fu Zhong pointed out: For more than twenty years, the people's revolutionary war has been the greatest reality, and he also cited the names of some heroic figures who emerged in the Chinese revolutionary war. He pointed out: Literature and art should portray the glorious images of these heroes to reflect the historical reality of the Chinese revolutionary war, in order to educate the people to be vigilant in defending the motherland and defending world peace.

    Hu Yaobang congratulated the conference on behalf of the Central Committee of the Youth League. He said: Our advanced literature and art have nourished our youth in the earth-shaking revolution and construction, growing into a new generation who are loyal to the motherland, full of confidence, and brave and intelligent. Now Chinese youth are working hard and studying to build the motherland. They are making new and higher demands on literary and art workers, asking them to help them raise their ideological and moral standards to a level commensurate with the great tasks they undertake. The youth eagerly hope that our literary artists will shape more and more vividly the image of the heroes of new China, more sharply expose the conflicts between the new and the old in our lives, and how new things overcome the stale and backward, and more powerfully depict the greatness and wisdom of our party and leaders. He also pointed out that the current unsatisfactory situation of reading materials for children must be changed.

    Hermlin's speech was warmly welcomed by the conference. He paid tribute to the conference on behalf of the German Writers' Association. He said that the German people are very concerned about all the activities of the Chinese people and Chinese writers. German writers have written many works praising the Chinese revolution. The works of many Chinese writers have become popular among German readers.

    At 3:00 p.m., Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at the conference. Thunderous applause erupted in the venue. Premier Zhou delivered a report at the meeting, elaborating in detail on the current state of national construction, giving all the delegates infinite encouragement. (Attached picture)

    周恩来总理到会作了重要报告
    【新华社二十三日讯】中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会二十三日上午在北京隆重开幕。下午，中央人民政府政务院总理周恩来出席大会作了重要报告。
    这次大会是在国家已经进入大规模的、有计划的经济建设时期中举行的。这个新的历史时期要求全国文学艺术工作者用自己的创作积极地参加国家建设，更多地创造有正确思想内容的优秀文学艺术作品，以社会主义的精神教育、鼓舞广大人民为逐步地实现国家工业化和过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。
    参加这次大会的正式代表五百六十人，列席一百八十九人，他们来自华北、东北、华东、中南、西南、西北六个大行政区和内蒙古自治区，以及中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军，广泛地代表了全国各地的文学、戏剧、电影、音乐、美术、舞蹈、曲艺等各方面的艺术工作者。
    为了分别地讨论文学艺术各部门的创作问题和组织问题，在大会期间内，将同时举行文学工作者的代表大会，戏剧、音乐、美术、舞蹈各协会的全国委员会扩大会议，此外电影、曲艺工作者的代表和各省、市文学艺术工作者联合会的代表，将分别举行座谈会。
    上午九时，大会全体代表一致选出郭沫若、茅盾、周扬、丁玲、老舍、夏衍、柯仲平、田汉、梅兰芳、萧三、草明、陈沂、徐悲鸿、齐白石、吕骥、马思聪、阳翰笙、冯雪峰、郑振铎、蔡楚生、史东山、洪深、欧阳予倩、赵树理、周立波、刘白羽、邵荃麟、沙汀、阿英、于黑丁、戴爱莲、王尊三等七十六人组成大会主席团。
    郭沫若主席致大会开幕词。他在叙述了中华人民共和国成立以来祖国史无先例的伟大变化，和国家进入第一个五年建设时期的光辉景象后说：四年多来，文学艺术有了显著的进步和发展。这是在中国共产党和毛主席的指导之下，在国家与人民的扶植和鼓励之下，全体文学艺术工作者努力的结果。但是，文学艺术工作的进步和发展还远跟不上当前国家建设的需要和人民生活的要求。
    郭沫若主席指出：为了适应新的历史时期中国家建设与人民的需要，这次大会的中心任务是总结四年来的工作经验，进一步地发展文学艺术的创作事业，鼓励作家和艺术家创造出更多更好的作品，加强文学艺术界更紧密的团结，健全文艺工作者的组织，改进文艺工作的领导，使文学艺术创作能够蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。
    郭沫若主席继续说：在逐步实现国家工业化和过渡到社会主义过程中，人民大众对于文艺生产的需要，无论在质上和量上，都在不断地增长。文艺工作者应努力来满足人民群众的这种需要。
    郭沫若主席号召作家、艺术家团结一心，推进工作，实事求是地逐步地克服文艺落后现象，使文学艺术各部门都得到丰收，相互竞赛地产生出无愧于伟大时代的作品。
    接着，出席大会开幕典礼的来宾、中华全国总工会主席赖若愚，中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部副主任傅钟，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记胡耀邦，和应邀来我国访问的德国作家协会副主席斯蒂芬·赫姆林先后在会上讲了话。
    赖若愚说：在国家建设时期，工人阶级的生产劳动和阶级斗争，应该是文艺创作素材的最主要的源泉，同时工人群众也应该是文艺创作的主要的读者或观众。他希望文艺工作者：首先要以共产主义的思想，教育和影响工人群众，帮助他们更加团结更加提高；同时要对工人和农民进行工农联盟的教育。
    傅钟在讲话中指出：二十多年来，人民革命战争是最伟大的现实，他还举出一些在中国革命战争中涌现出来的英雄人物的名字。他指出：文学艺术应该刻画这些英雄的光辉形象，来反映中国革命战争的历史现实，以教育人民警惕地保卫祖国，保卫世界和平。
    胡耀邦代表青年团中央委员会向大会祝贺。他说：我国先进的文学艺术，滋养着我国青年在翻天覆地的革命和建设中，成长为忠于祖国、充满信心，勇敢而有智慧的新的一代。现在中国青年正在为建设祖国而努力劳动和学习，他们向文艺工作者提出新的更高的要求，要求帮助他们把自己的思想道德水平，提高到与所担负的伟大任务相适应的高度。青年们热望我国的文学艺术家更多和更生动地塑造新中国英雄的形象，更尖锐地揭发我们生活中新与旧的冲突，和新事物如何战胜陈腐落后的东西，更有力地描绘我们党和领袖的伟大与英明。他并指出必须改变目前少年儿童读物不能令人满意的状况。
    赫姆林的讲话受到大会热烈的欢迎。他代表德国作家协会向大会致敬意。他说德国人民非常关心中国人民和中国作家的全部活动。德国作家写过许多歌颂中国革命的作品。很多中国作家的作品，已经在德国读者中间流行。
