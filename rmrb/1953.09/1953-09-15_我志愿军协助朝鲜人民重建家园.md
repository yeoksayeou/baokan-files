According to incomplete statistics, in the past two years, this unit has helped the Korean people cultivate and harvest crops on 27,696,160 pyeong (approximately 137,372 mu in our country) of land, repaired 889 water dikes and canals plus another 46,791 meters, collected 6,442,321 jin of firewood and grass, planted 734,394 trees, built 286 houses, dug 738 air-raid shelters, and carried more than 156,400 dan of water.

From July 5th to 15th this year, this unit also organized thousands of cadres and soldiers to help farmers in the驻地（zhù dì garrison or stationed troops) to put out insect pests and protect the growth of seedlings. Ren Tingchang, the deputy squad leader of a certain unit, gloriously dedicated his precious life while helping the Korean people rush to plant crops under artillery fire. The Fourth Company of a certain unit also raised four Korean orphans during the war. When the troops set out to perform their tasks, the soldiers also dug an air-raid shelter with a heated kang for the orphans, sewed cotton clothes and shoes, and left 300 jin of grain for the orphans to eat.

The meeting called on all subordinate units to further promote the spirit of internationalism and help the Korean people heal the wounds of war, while vigilantly guarding their positions and preventing sabotage and attacks from the enemy. The meeting decided that all units should first quickly assist the Korean people in the garrison area to repair the schools, public activity places, and government offices destroyed by the enemy, assist the Korean people who had moved out of their homes due to the war to return to their hometowns, and help residents with insufficient labor to build houses and carry out autumn harvests and other labor production.

    我志愿军协助朝鲜人民重建家园
   【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】中国人民志愿军某部政治部于最近召开会议，具体布置帮助朝鲜人民重建家园、医治战争创伤的工作。
    战争期间，这支部队发扬了伟大的国际主义精神，在帮助朝鲜人民劳动生产、医治疾病和救济朝鲜灾民等方面做出了很大成绩。据不完全统计，两年来这支部队共帮助朝鲜人民耕种收割了二千七百六十九万六千一百六十坪（约合我国十三万七千三百七十二亩）土地上的庄稼，修水堤、水渠八百八十九条另四万六千七百九十一公尺，打柴、割草六百四十四万二千三百二十一斤，植树七十三万四千三百九十四株，修建房屋二百八十六间，挖防空洞七百三十八个，挑水十五万六千四百多担。另外，这支部队还给遭受战争灾害的朝鲜人民发放救济粮五十三万七千三百七十五斤，捐助了大批衣服和鞋子，另外还医治受伤和生病的朝鲜人民三万多人，并给许多朝鲜人民注射了防疫针和种了牛痘。今年七月五日到十五日，这支部队又组织了成千成万干部战士帮助驻地农民扑灭了虫灾，保护了禾苗的生长。这支部队的某部副班长任廷昌曾在炮火下帮助朝鲜人民抢种庄稼时，光荣地贡献了自己宝贵的生命。某部四连并在战争期间抚养了四个朝鲜孤儿。当部队出发执行任务时，战士们还给孤儿挖了一个有热炕的防空洞，缝了棉衣、棉鞋，并留下了三百斤粮食给孤儿食用。
    最近，这支部队的政治部特召开会议，对如何协助朝鲜人民进行恢复建设工作作了具体布置。会议号召所属各部队在警惕地守卫阵地、防止来自对方的破坏和袭击行动的同时，进一步发挥国际主义精神，帮助朝鲜人民医治战争创伤。会议决定各部队首先迅速协助驻区内的朝鲜人民修建被敌人破坏的学校、公共活动场所和政府办公处，协助因战争迁居在外的朝鲜人民返回故里，帮助劳动力不足的居民修筑房屋和进行秋收等劳动生产。会议并决定协助朝鲜政府救济当地灾民，并继续为居民治疗疾病，保护他们的健康。
