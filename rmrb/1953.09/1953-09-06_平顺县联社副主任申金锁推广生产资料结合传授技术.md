    Shen Jinshuo, Deputy Director of Pingshun County Cooperative, Promotes Production Materials Combined with Technical Instruction
    Reader Yue Weiliang writes: Comrade Shen Jinshuo, Deputy Director of the Pingshun County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation in Shanxi Province, in order to implement the principle of "teach before selling, no sale without knowing how" in the supply of agricultural production materials, actively learned the techniques of using new-style farm tools, pesticides, and fertilizer powder himself, and then went to the countryside with the techniques to promote them. He has taught 32 farmers in the fourth district of the county how to use the new-style walking plow, so that many walking plows, which were previously sold through administrative orders and were always called "hanging plows" by farmers, have been put to use. When he teaches techniques to farmers, he can not only explain the principles clearly, but also demonstrate them to the farmers. When he learned that the farmers in Wanli Village thought that the walking plow was not as easy to use as the old-fashioned plow, he and a mutual aid team leader from the village carried the walking plow and the old-fashioned plow to the field for testing, and also organized farmers to go to the field to observe; after the farmers saw with their own eyes that the new plow had many advantages such as light pulling force and deep ploughing, many of them were prepared to add new-style walking plows. When he learned that the farmers in Wangqu Village lacked topdressing fertilizer, but were afraid that fertilizer powder was unreliable, he rushed to the village and promoted the effectiveness of fertilizer powder to the farmers at the field, and taught them how to use fertilizer powder. This not only solved the farmers' difficulty in lacking fertilizer, but also sold 880 jin of fertilizer powder that the cooperative had accumulated. Due to Comrade Shen Jinshuo's approach being welcomed by the broad masses, the Pingshun County Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued a circular of commendation for Comrade Shen Jinshuo's work methods and called on the cadres of the county to learn from him.

    平顺县联社副主任申金锁推广生产资料结合传授技术
    读者岳维良来信：山西平顺县供销合作社联合社副主任申金锁同志为了在农业生产资料的供应工作中贯彻“先教后卖、不会不卖”的方针，自己就积极学会了使用新式农具、农药、肥田粉的技术，然后带技术下乡进行推广。他先后在该县四区教会了三十二个农民使用新式步犁，使过去用行政命令推销出去的，一向被农民称为“挂犁”的许多步犁得到了利用。他在向农民传授技术时，不但能够讲清道理，而且还能做出样子来给农民看。当他知道湾里村农民认为步犁不如老式犁好使时，就和该村一个互助组长分别背了步犁和老式犁到田里去试验，同时还组织农民下地去参观；农民亲眼看到新犁拉力轻、耕得深等许多好处后，就有不少人都准备添置新式步犁。当他知道王曲村农民缺少追肥，但又怕肥田粉不可靠的时候，就赶到该村在地头向农民们宣传肥田粉的效力，并教他们使用肥田粉的方法，这样既解决了农民缺肥的困难，同时又把合作社积压的八百八十斤肥田粉推销出去了。由于申金锁同志这种做法受到了广大群众的欢迎，中共平顺县委员会对申金锁同志的工作方法已予通报表扬，并号召该县干部向他学习。
