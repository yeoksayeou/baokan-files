Since the Northeast Region implemented new construction engineering quotas and wage rates in June, construction departments in various areas have significantly improved labor efficiency in the two months since implementing these regulations. This is of great significance for accelerating project progress, improving project quality, and reducing construction costs.

The 1953 construction engineering quotas and wage rates for the Northeast Region were formulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Northeast Administrative Committee based on the actual quota levels achieved by construction workers in various regions last year. Taking into account the possibility of improving labor organization and further promoting advanced experiences, they were developed from the bottom up, following the principle of average advancement, after repeated research and discussion by workers, technicians, and relevant department cadres. The various indicators of this new labor quota, with the exception of a few types of work, are generally about 25% higher than last year, thereby breaking the obstacles of outdated quotas to the enthusiasm and technical level of employees.

In the process of implementing the new quotas, construction departments in various areas vigorously promoted advanced experiences, which played a major role in achieving and exceeding the new quotas. Changchun, Heilongjiang, Fushun, Liaoxi, Shenyang, Dalian, and other places successively held basic construction advanced experience exchange conferences or exhibitions in the process of implementing the new quotas, promoting the popularization of advanced experiences. At present, the promotion of several major advanced experiences, such as Su Changyou's group's three-stage bricklaying method, Xie Wanfu's group's woodworking assembly line method, and Yang Dezhong's group's plastering method, has become more in-depth. Many workers or groups who did not pay attention to advanced experiences in the past have had to actively learn advanced production methods in order to meet the new quotas. For example, after the bricklayers at the Shenyang 105 construction site recognized the importance of advanced experience, they actively studied and vigorously promoted advanced experience in bricklaying. Now, the time to build a floor of bricks has been reduced from eight days to two and a half days. Another example is the bricklayer Li Shihua group of the Second Engineering Company of the Electric Power Bureau. In the past, they did not learn the double-hand mortar squeezing method, and each person averaged only 700 bricks per day. After discussing the new quota, they abandoned the large shovel and adopted the double-hand mortar squeezing method, and laid 1,570 bricks on the first day, exceeding the quota. Before the implementation of the new quota, the Shenyang Yu Shilai carpentry group, due to not learning advanced experience, could only make a maximum of ten door and window frames per day. After learning Xie Wanfu's woodworking assembly line method, they appropriately specialized and divided labor according to different technical levels, from cutting, marking, drilling, straightening, and grooving to installation, increasing the number of window frames made from ten to nineteen per day.

The new quotas also promoted many new creations and the adoption of new tools. An Deben, an advanced worker of the First Engineering Company of Songjiang Province, developed a large joint assembly line method on the basis of learning Xie Wanfu's woodworking assembly line method, which enabled joint operations in various processes and solved the coordination problems of each process, and efficiency quickly improved. Qin Yucai, the leader of the bricklaying team of the Second Engineering Office of the Industrial Construction Engineering Company of the Central Construction Engineering Department, created a horizontal sliding bricklaying device, and each person can now lay an average of 2,500 bricks per day. Yang Dezhong's group continued to improve tools and labor organization, and the workers greatly exceeded the new quotas, with the highest reaching 180% of the new quotas. Many new tools have also been widely adopted. In the past, the workers of the Third Construction Engineering Company of Dalian created eighty new tools, but only more than a dozen were adopted, and many important and excellent tools were not promoted and used. After the implementation of the new quota, the leaders conducted in-depth investigations to help workers reach and exceed the new quota, and rushed to make a large number of new tools.

The new quotas have also promoted the improvement of labor organization. In some places, although advanced experience has been learned, unreasonable labor organization still leads to idle work and low efficiency. For example, in a staff dormitory in the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Fourth Work Area, the first floor alone had a total of 160,000 bricks, but six or seventy bricklayers were often concentrated on it at the same time. The workers were crowded together, and originally each person could lay more than ten bricks per minute, but in this case, they could not even lay five bricks. The bricklaying quota was 1,400 bricks, but each person only laid seven or eight hundred bricks per day, and workers generally did not receive enough basic wages. After improving the labor organization, bricklayers can now lay an average of 1,800 bricks per day.

Before and after the announcement of the new labor quotas, relevant departments in various places conducted thorough political education for the employees, explaining the reason that the new labor quotas can both improve labor efficiency and take care of employee income. Therefore, many employees warmly welcomed the implementation of the new labor quotas. The workers of the Zhang Daying group at the Harbin Medical University construction site strengthened their overall concept after the announcement of the new labor quotas. They got up at three o'clock in the morning to lay the stone foundation, avoiding the idle work of other types of work. Many construction sites have also paid attention to strengthening labor discipline, improving attendance rates, and further improving construction management.

Recently, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Northeast Administrative Committee conducted inspections and research based on the implementation of the new labor quotas in various places, and found that some of the quotas for ash carriers and carpenters were set too high. Therefore, it was decided to make appropriate revisions to make the new labor quotas more reasonable.

### 东北区推行新的建筑工程定额以来  建筑部门的劳动效率显著提高

    东北区推行新的建筑工程定额以来
    建筑部门的劳动效率显著提高
    【本报讯】东北区在六月间公布了一九五三年新的建筑工程定额和工资单价，两个多月来，各地建筑部门在实行这一规定中，都大大提高了劳动效率。这对于加速工程进度、提高工程质量和降低建筑成本有很大的意义。
    东北区一九五三年建筑工程定额和工资单价，是东北行政委员会财政经济委员会根据去年各地建筑工人实际达到的定额水平，并在可能改善劳动组织与进一步推广先进经验的基础上，按照平均先进的原则，自下而上地经过工人、技术人员和有关部门干部的反复研究讨论后制订出来的。这个新劳动定额的各种指标，除少数工种外，一般都比去年提高了百分之二十五左右，从而打破了陈旧定额对职工提高劳动积极性和技术水平的障碍。
    在贯彻新定额的过程中，各地建筑部门大力推广了先进经验，对达到和突破新定额起了主要的作用。长春、黑龙江、抚顺、辽西、沈阳、旅大等地在贯彻新定额过程中，都先后召开了基本建设先进经验交流大会或展览会，推动了先进经验的推广工作。目前，几种主要的先进经验，如苏长有小组的三段砌砖法、谢万福小组的木工流水作业法和杨德重小组的抹灰法等的推广工作已更加深入了。许多过去不重视先进经验的工人或小组，为了达到新的定额，就不得不积极学习先进的生产方法。例如沈阳一零五工地瓦工认识到先进经验的重要性后，就积极学习并大力推行砌砖方面的先进经验，现在砌一层楼的砖的时间，已由过去的八天减少到两天半。又如电工局第二工程公司瓦工李世华小组过去不学习双手挤浆法，每人平均每天只砌七百块砖，讨论新的定额后，放弃了大铲，采用了双手挤浆法，第一天即砌砖一千五百七十块，超过了定额。沈阳于世来木工组在新定额未实行前，由于不学习先进经验，每天最多只做十个门窗框，在学习谢万福木工流水作业法后，按不同的技术水平，从截料、划线、打眼、直边、裁口直到安装，都适当地进行了专业分工，由每天做十个窗框提高到做十九个窗框。
    新定额也促进了许多新的创造和新工具的采用。松江省第一工程公司先进工人安德本在学习谢万福木工流水作业法的基础上，发展了大联合流水作业法，使各工序进行了联合作业，解决了各工序的配合问题，效率迅速提高。中央建筑工程部工业建筑工程公司第二工程处瓦工小组长秦玉才创造水平滑动砌砖器后，平均每人每天可砌砖二千五百块。杨德重小组不断改进工具和劳动组织，工人们大大超过了新的定额，最高的达到新定额百分之一百八十。许多新工具也被普遍采用了。旅大第三建筑工程公司的工人，过去创造了八十种新工具，采用的只十多种，许多重要的优良的工具都没有推广使用。这次实行新定额后，领导方面为了帮助工人达到与突破新的定额，进行了深入调查，赶制了大批新工具。
    新的定额也推动了劳动组织的改善。有的地方虽然也学习了先进经验，但劳动组织不合理，仍然发生窝工和效率不高的现象。例如鞍钢土建四工区一座职工宿舍，其中一层楼一共只十六万块砖的工程，可是却经常集中六七十个瓦工在上面同时施工。工人干起活来挤在一起，本来每人一分钟可砌十多块，但在这种情况下连五块还砌不上。砌砖定额是一千四百块，可是每人每天只砌七、八百块，工人普遍拿不足基本工资；改进劳动组织以后，瓦工砌砖每人每天平均已能达到一千八百块了。
    在新的劳动定额公布前后，各地有关部门都曾向职工们进行了充分的政治教育，说明新的劳动定额既可提高劳动效率，又能照顾职工收入的道理。因此，许多职工都热烈地欢迎新的劳动定额的实施。哈尔滨医科大学工地张大英小组的工人，在新劳动定额公布后加强了整体观念，他们早上三点多钟就起来砌石头基础，避免了其他工种的窝工现象。许多工地也都注意加强劳动纪律，提高出勤率，进一步改善施工管理工作。
    最近，东北行政委员会财政经济委员会根据各地对新劳动定额的执行情况，进行了检查和研究，发现挑灰工和木工的部分定额定的较高，因此决定作适当的修改，以便使新劳动定额更加合理。
