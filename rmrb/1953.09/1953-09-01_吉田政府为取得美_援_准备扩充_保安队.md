    Yoshida Government Prepares to Expand "Security Force" to Obtain US "Aid"
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th: According to Japanese radio broadcasts, US Senate Republican leader Knowland, who is traveling in Far Eastern countries, arrived in Japan on August 25th and left Japan for Korea on the 28th. While in Japan, Knowland held talks with Prime Minister Yoshida on "important issues involving Japan and the United States." News reports: The American legislator discussed the following issues with Yoshida: expanding the Japanese armed forces, absorbing American capital, and the United States providing military assistance to Japan in accordance with the "Mutual Security Agency." Knowland spoke with Toshiro Nakano, the director-general of the northern "Security Force" (the core of the reviving Japanese army), and inspected the armaments of a portion of the "Security Force" stationed in Chitose.
    It is clear from various news reports that Knowland's visit to Tokyo was to accelerate the revival of the Japanese army. He said at a press conference: "An armed Japanese force of 110,000 men (referring to the 'Security Force') is not enough." He said: The United States will "re-estimate its military assistance to countries according to the extent of their cooperation in maintaining collective security,"
    "I will ask the (American) government and Congress to reconsider the entire Mutual Security Assistance program." International News Service said: This is a "warning" to the Yoshida government that it will "lose American aid" if it does not step up rearmament.
    Xinhua News Agency, 31st: Tokyo news: In order to obtain the Mutual Security Agency "aid" from the United States, the Yoshida government has torn off the fig leaf of "gradually increasing defense capabilities" and is preparing to embark on large-scale rearmament.
    Yoshida government's Deputy Prime Minister Taketora Ogata announced when he met with reporters on the 28th: "The government is studying plans to increase the National Security Force personnel from the current 110,000 to 130,000 or 150,000 in the 1954 fiscal year." He also stated that the nature of the Security Force should be changed to "cope with the new situation," including revising the "Security Agency Law." This is the first time the Yoshida government has publicly admitted that it wants to expand the ranks of its disguised army, the "Security Force." Prior to this, in order to ease the opposition of the Japanese people, the Yoshida government had consistently maintained the deceptive slogan of "gradually increasing defense capabilities" and claimed that "increasing Security Force personnel is not currently being considered." Ogata Taketora also admitted when he met with reporters that the Yoshida government's expansion of cannon fodder troops was to obtain the Mutual Security Agency "aid" from the United States. He said: "To conclude the Mutual Security Assistance Agreement currently being negotiated between the United States and Japan, a defense plan is necessary."
    The Yoshida government's declared attempt to expand the "Security Force" has aroused the anger of the Japanese people. The left and right wings of the Japanese Socialist Party have also seized the opportunity to attack the Yoshida government. Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the right-wing Socialist Party, said: "The government is violating the constitution and further leading the country down the road of rearmament." Masaru Nozoe, Secretary-General of the left-wing Socialist Party, said: Ogata Taketora's remarks were "the Yoshida government openly admitting rearmament in order to receive Mutual Security Agency aid. This is clearly an open challenge to the constitution that renounces war." Both parties have stated that they will hold the Yoshida government accountable.

### 吉田政府为取得美“援”  准备扩充“保安队”

    吉田政府为取得美“援”
    准备扩充“保安队”
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社二十九日讯：据日本电台广播，正在远东各国旅行的美国参议院共和党领袖诺兰于八月二十五日到达日本，并在二十八日离日本赴朝鲜。诺兰在日本时与吉田首相就“涉及日本和美国的一些重要问题”进行了商谈。消息报道：这位美国议员与吉田讨论了下面的一些问题：扩充日本武装部队，吸收美国资本，美国按照“共同安全署”的方针对日本提供军事援助。诺兰曾与北部的“保安队”（正在复活中的日本军队的核心）的总监中野敏夫谈话，并视察了该“保安队”驻在千岁的一部分的军备情况。
    从各报消息中可以明显看出，诺兰访问东京，是为了加速恢复日本军队。他在记者招待会上说：“十一万人的日本武装部队（指“保安队”）是不够的。”他说：美国将“按照各国在维持集体安全方面的合作程度来重新估计美国对它们的军事援助”，
    “我将要求（美国）政府和国会重新考虑整个的共同安全援助计划。”国际新闻社说：这是“警告”吉田政府，它如果不加紧重新武装就“会失去美国的援助”。
    【新华社三十一日讯】东京消息：为了取得美国的共同安全署“援助”，吉田政府已撕开了“逐渐增加防卫力”的遮羞布，准备着手大规模重新武装。
    吉田政府副首相绪方竹虎在二十八日接见记者时宣布：“政府正在研究一些计划，以便在一九五四会计年度内将国家保安队人员从目前的十一万人增加到十三万或十五万人。”他并表示要改变保安队的性质以“应付新的形势”，其中包括修改“保安厅法”。这是吉田政府第一次公开承认要扩充它的变相陆军“保安队”的兵员。在这以前，吉田政府为了缓和日本人民的反对，一贯在口头上保持所谓“逐渐增加防卫力”的欺骗口号，宣称“目前不考虑增加保安队人员”。绪方竹虎在接见记者时并承认，吉田政府扩充炮灰部队是为了取得美国的共同安全署“援助”。他说：“要缔结目前正在美国和日本之间谈判的共同安全援助协定，一个防御计划是必要的。”
    吉田政府宣布要扩充“保安队”的企图，已激起日本人民的愤慨。日本的左右两派社会党也乘机对吉田政府进行攻击。右派社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎说：“政府违犯宪法，把国家进一步引上了重新武装的道路。”左派社会党总书记野沟胜说：绪方竹虎的谈话是“吉田政府公开承认为了接受共同安全署援助而重新武装。这显然是对于弃绝战争的宪法的公开挑战。”这两个党并表示要追究吉田政府的责任。
