    Northwest Grain Bureau Engineering Team Should Correct the Ideology of Neglecting Project Quality

    Duan Jiu'an from the Basic Construction Group of the Tianshui Special District Grain Bureau of Gansu Province writes: The Gansu Provincial Grain Bureau built three new warehouses in Beidaobu, Tianshui in July this year, and the Northwest Grain Bureau Engineering Team was responsible for the construction. During the construction, we found that the rubble foundation of this project did not meet the requirements of the construction manual, and we repeatedly asked the engineering team to correct it; however, they always ignored it. On August 10, we found that the foundation grouting of the third warehouse project was insufficient, with large gaps, and immediately invited relevant units to form an inspection team for inspection. The results proved that the entire grout of the large foundation foot of the third warehouse project was not fully grouted, nor was it filled with small stone chips; there were many gaps in the plinth walls of the first and second warehouse projects. In short, the inspection team excavated nineteen places for inspection, and loopholes were found in every place. However, at that time, Guo Zigang, the captain of the engineering team, was still dissatisfied and said: "Inspect it! How can a project not have a few small holes!"

    The Northwest Grain Bureau Engineering Team's erroneous attitude of neglecting project quality is very harmful to the country's construction work. The Northwest Grain Bureau should thoroughly inspect the work of the engineering team and completely correct their erroneous work attitude.

    西北粮食管理局工程队应纠正忽视工程质量的思想
    甘肃省粮食局天水专区基本建设小组段久安来信：甘肃省粮食局今年七月在天水北道埠新建仓库三幢，由西北粮食管理局工程队负责施工。在施工时，我们发现这个工程的块石基础不符合施工说明书的规定，就多次要求工程队改正；但他们却始终置之不理。八月十日，我们发现第三幢仓库工程的基础灌浆不足，有很大的空隙，当即邀请有关单位组成检查小组进行检查。结果证明第三幢仓库工程大方脚部分全部灰浆未灌实，也未用小石片填塞；第一、二幢仓库工程勒脚墙有很多空隙。总之，检查小组共挖掘了十九处进行检查，而每处都发现了漏洞。但在当时，工程队队长郭子岗竟还不满意地说：“检查就检查吧！工程还能没有几个小窟窿！”
    西北粮食管理局工程队这种忽视工程质量的错误态度，对国家建设工作的危害性是很大的。西北粮食管理局应该深入检查工程队的工作，彻底纠正他们这种错误的工作态度。
