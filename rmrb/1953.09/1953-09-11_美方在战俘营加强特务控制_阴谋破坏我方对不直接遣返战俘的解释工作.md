Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th: News from the South Korean POW camps detaining non-directly repatriated prisoners of war indicates that the U.S. side is actively strengthening its special agent control over captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who are not directly repatriated, plotting to sabotage our side's explanation work.

In the Nonsan No. 1 POW camp for non-directly repatriated prisoners, Syngman Rhee's special agents formed a new special agent organization called the "Special Agent Team" on August 5th, with the original head of the "Anti-Communist Youth League," Wen Chonghao, concurrently serving as the captain; each camp also has so-called "Special Work Teams." On August 9th, a Korean special agent with the rank of Major with the surname Xian from the Tokyo U.S. Military Headquarters "CIE" special agent agency, arrived at the Nonsan POW camp to directly preside over special agent activities. This Major special agent once told his subordinates: "In the future, we must transform all anti-communist organizations into strong underground organizations!" By August 21st, another forty to fifty South Korean special agents wearing U.S. military uniforms and bearing the ranks of Captain and Lieutenant arrived, residing at the U.S. military POW camp commander Colonel Hill's residence, holding meetings in a tin house next to the POW camp every day, and then going to various camps in groups to lecture the POWs. These special agents wanted the POWs to organize riots when they were under the supervision of neutral countries in the future, throw stones and demonstrate at the representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides who were conducting explanation work, and beat them, saying that "all methods that can be thought of can be used," and also said, "Anyway, you will not be held responsible for any chaos."

These sinister activities became increasingly rampant. On September 4th, the Syngman Rhee bandit special agents in the Nonsan POW camp drove more than 4,000 POWs to the square to listen to a lecture by an American general. This portly general was wearing a white summer military uniform and red leather boots. The special agents claimed that he was an American Major General sent from Tokyo headquarters. In his speech, he threatened the POWs in this way: "You must believe what our management authorities and all anti-communist organizations say, and stay in South Korea. If you believe what the Communist side says and want to return to North Korea, that will be a dead end!" During his speech, more than one hundred fully armed U.S. troops were stationed around the venue, and the security was extremely tight.

News from various POW camps in South Korea indicates that after the agreement on the POW repatriation issue was reached, the Syngman Rhee special agents in each POW camp received unified orders to organize "Special Agent Teams" to carry out deceptive propaganda and intimidation, and to more closely control the POWs. As long as POWs slightly reveal their longing for their motherland, they will be brutally beaten and killed. In the Busan Geoje-ri No. 2 POW camp, a captured soldier of the People's Army surnamed Jin was beaten and arrested for this reason. According to news, the Syngman Rhee bandit special agents also secretly organized "death squads" in the POW camps in order to coerce the POWs in the future to obstruct and sabotage our side's explanation work for the POWs. The above-mentioned sinister activities of the Syngman Rhee bandit special agents have received full support and assistance from the U.S. military POW camp authorities.

### 美方在战俘营加强特务控制  阴谋破坏我方对不直接遣返战俘的解释工作

    美方在战俘营加强特务控制
    阴谋破坏我方对不直接遣返战俘的解释工作
    【新华社开城十日电】自南朝鲜拘留不直接遣返战俘的战俘营传来的消息说，美方正积极加强对不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员的特务控制，预谋破坏我方的解释工作。
    在不直接遣返的论山第一号战俘营，李承晚特务在八月五日奉命组成了新的特务组织“特务队”，队长由原来的“反共青年团”负责人文重浩兼任；各个营场还设有所谓“特工队”。八月九日，东京美军总部“CIE”特务机关派了一个少校衔的姓咸的朝鲜籍特务，到论山战俘营直接主持特务活动。这个少校特务曾对他手下的人说：“将来我们要把一切反共团体转化为坚强的地下组织！”到八月二十一日，又来了四、五十个穿美军制服、佩戴着大尉、中尉军阶的南朝鲜特务，住在美军战俘营司令官希尔上校那里，每天在战俘营旁边的一个铁皮房子里开会，然后分组到各营场活动，对战俘训话。这些特务要战俘们在将来由中立国看管时组织骚动，向进行解释工作的朝中方面代表扔石头、示威，殴打他们，“凡是能想得出来的一切办法都可以用”，还说：“反正出了乱子不要你们负责。”
    这种罪恶活动愈到后来愈加猖狂。九月四日，论山战俘营中的李匪特务将四千多名战俘赶到广场上去听一个美国将军的训话。这个胖胖的将军穿着白色夏季军服，脚上穿着红色的皮靴。特务们宣称他是东京总部派来的美国少将。他在讲话中曾这样地恐吓战俘说：“你们要相信我们管理当局和所有反共组织的话，要留在南朝鲜。如果你们相信了共方的话，要回北朝鲜去，那将是死路一条！”在他讲话的时候，会场四周布有一百多名全副武装的美军，警卫极为森严。
    从南朝鲜各战俘营中来的消息表明，在关于战俘遣返问题的协议达成以后，各战俘营的李承晚特务都曾得到统一的命令，组织“特务队”，进行欺骗宣传和恫吓，更加严密地控制战俘。战俘只要稍微流露怀念祖国的情绪，就要遭受毒打和虐杀。在釜山巨济里第二战俘收容所，就有一个姓金的人民军被俘人员因为这个原故被毒打后捕走。据消息说，李匪特务为了将来胁迫战俘阻挠和破坏我方对战俘的解释工作，还在战俘营中秘密组织了“决死队”。李匪特务的上述罪恶活动都得到了美军战俘营当局的充分支持和协助。
