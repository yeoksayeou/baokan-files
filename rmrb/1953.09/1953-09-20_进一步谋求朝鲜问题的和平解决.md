Further Seek a Peaceful Resolution to the Korean Question
Li Gao

Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's "Report on the Anti-American Aid Korea Work of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army" at the 24th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee is a brilliant summary of the great victory of the heroic Chinese people cooperating with the Korean people in resisting the American war of aggression over the past three years. After reading this report, we have a more comprehensive understanding of the international and historical significance of the great victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples.

From Commander Peng's report, we can see that the victory of the Korean and Chinese people has gone through a difficult and complex struggle. When the American aggressors, who believed in force, tore up international agreements, refused to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and madly advanced on the road of military adventure, we gave them continuous and relentless blows on the Korean battlefield, shouting loudly "This road is impassable," forcing them to accept the armistice negotiations. During the negotiation process, we consistently adhered to the correct position of peaceful consultation, constantly exposed all its intimidation, blackmail, and provocative conspiracies, and united the world's peace forces to fight it resolutely. Thus, as Commander Peng pointed out: "The truth of the enemy's brutality and weakness was exposed on the battlefield, and the enemy's bellicose and unreasonable imperialist face was also exposed in the Korean armistice negotiations. This made them increasingly isolated in the eyes of the people of the world." The victory of the Korean armistice was achieved under such circumstances.

Now that we have achieved the victory of the Korean armistice, can we relax our efforts in the anti-American and aid Korea struggle? No. We still have very arduous tasks ahead of us. Commander Peng told us: "...The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is just the beginning of a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The current task is to consolidate the Korean armistice, ensure strict compliance with the armistice terms to prevent the recurrence of the war of aggression, and promote the smooth convening of the political conference to further seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean question."

The facts of the more than fifty days since the Korean armistice have proven that the American aggressive conspiracy has not stopped because of its failure in the Korean war of aggression. As everyone knows, as soon as the Korean armistice was achieved, the United States pressured other countries participating in the Korean war of aggression to issue a so-called "Sixteen-Nation Declaration" with it, clamoring to resume the Korean War and expand it to areas not limited to Korea. American warmongers such as Dulles have also repeatedly repeated this arrogant intimidation. America's lackey, Syngman Rhee, yelled even more fiercely, claiming that he would withdraw from the conference with the United States ninety days after the political conference was held, and use force to unify Korea. The United States has already concluded an aggressive military alliance treaty with him - the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty," intending to keep American troops stationed in Korea for a long time. The United States has not only not reduced its aggressive forces in the Far East recently, but has also sent an additional Marine Division to reinforce them. In the repatriation of prisoners of war in Korea, the United States violated the armistice agreement and detained a large number of our captured personnel who should have been directly repatriated. In the demilitarized zone on the armistice line, the U.S. side has violated the armistice agreement more than fifty times. At the same time, the United States openly announced its intervention and expansion of the war of aggression in Vietnam. In Japan, the American base for aggression in the Far East, the United States is urging it to accelerate its rearmament. One of America's warmongers, reactionary Senator Knowland, recently went to Japan, Taiwan, and other places to carry out conspiracies. At the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States used extremely despicable and arrogant means to force the United Nations to pass the so-called "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" unilaterally concocted by the United States, attempting to turn the political conference into another face-to-face "Panmunjom negotiation" between the belligerent parties, so that the United States could manipulate the political conference and realize Dulles and Syngman Rhee's plan to withdraw from the political conference after ninety days. From this series of aggressive conspiracies, it is not difficult to see that the United States is concentrating its efforts to obstruct and undermine the peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

Therefore, Commander Peng Dehuai proposed to the people of the whole country: "The current task is to consolidate the Korean armistice, ensure strict compliance with the armistice terms to prevent the recurrence of the war of aggression, and promote the smooth convening of the political conference to further seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean question."

We must heighten our vigilance, strengthen our forces, and prevent new provocations by U.S. imperialism. In the struggle to achieve this, all commanders and fighters of our Volunteer Army have full confidence and preparation. Commander Peng has reported to the people of the motherland: "All officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will be a hundred times more vigilant against the conspiracies and provocations of the American warmongers and the Syngman Rhee clique, strictly guard our positions, be prepared to crush any possible sudden invasion by the enemy at any time, and complete our glorious self-defense mission." In order to respond to this solemn oath of the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland, the Central People's Government Committee said in its message of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: "The people of the whole country will vigorously carry out economic construction, strengthen national defense forces, and continue to carry out the anti-American aid Korea movement in depth to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. The government and people of the People's Republic of China will do their best to help the heroic Korean people heal the wounds of war and restore peaceful life." Thanks to the efforts of the people of the whole country in the anti-American aid Korea movement, we have extinguished the flames of war that burned to the door of our motherland and won a better environment for peace. Now, our conditions are more favorable than before, and our efforts will surely greatly promote the economic construction, national defense construction, and anti-American aid Korea movement of our motherland.

In order to hold a good political conference and defeat the US conspiracy to sabotage the political conference, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, and Li Dongjian, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, have successively telegraphed the Secretary-General of the United Nations, proposing a reply to the two draft resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly on the Korean issue, unanimously refuting the resolution passed by the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly on the composition of the political conference as unreasonable; Reaffirming that the political conference should take the form of a round-table conference jointly negotiated by the armistice parties with the participation of other relevant countries, and suggesting that the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly take steps as soon as possible to expand the members of the political conference so that the conference can be convened quickly. After this reply was put forward, it has aroused widespread response from world opinion. We, together with the peace-loving people of the world, unanimously support the proposals of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Deputy Foreign Minister Li Dongjian, and will never allow the conspiracy of American schemers to sabotage the political conference to succeed.

Commander Peng Dehuai said it well: "It must be solemnly warned to the American warmongers that if you or your lackey, the Syngman Rhee clique, dare to break faith and destroy the Korean Armistice Agreement and launch a war of aggression again, then you will surely be battered and bloodied. Any conspiracy of yours to make the political conference miscarry and be sabotaged will surely be met with the most resolute opposition from the Korean and Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world and suffer more serious failures." The Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world will use this sentence to warn the American aggressors.

    进一步谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决
    李高
    中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员在中央人民政府委员会第二十四次会议上所作的“关于中国人民志愿军抗美援朝工作的报告”，是三年来英勇的中国人民配合朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略战争的伟大胜利的光辉总结。读到这一报告，我们更加全面地认识了中朝人民的伟大胜利所具有的国际意义和历史意义。
    从彭司令员的报告中，我们可以看到，朝中人民的胜利是经历了艰难复杂的斗争过程的。当迷信武力的美国侵略者撕毁国际协定，拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，在军事冒险道路上疯狂进犯的时候，我们在朝鲜战场上给它以连续的无情的打击，向它大喝一声“此路不通”，逼得它不得不接受停战谈判。而在谈判的过程中，我们一贯坚持和平协商的正确主张，不断地揭破它的一切恫吓、讹诈和挑衅阴谋，并团结全世界的和平力量和它坚决斗争。这样，正如彭司令员指出的：“敌人的残暴和虚弱的真相在战场上暴露出来了，而敌人的好战和横蛮无理的帝国主义面目，也在朝鲜停战谈判中暴露出来了。这就使他们在全世界人民面前日益孤立。”朝鲜停战的胜利，就是在这样的形势下取得的。
    既然已经取得了朝鲜停战的胜利，我们的抗美援朝斗争是不是可以放松一点了呢？不能。我们面前还有非常艰巨的任务。彭司令员告诉我们说：“……朝鲜停战协定的签订，不过是和平解决朝鲜问题的开端。当前的任务是巩固朝鲜停战，保证严格遵守停战条款以严防侵略战争的再起，促成政治会议的顺利召开以进一步谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。”
    朝鲜停战后五十多天来的事实证明，美国的侵略阴谋是没有因它在侵朝战争中失败而停止的。大家知道，朝鲜停战刚一实现，美国就压迫参加侵朝战争的其他各国和它一道发表了一个所谓“十六国宣言”，叫嚣着恢复朝鲜战争并且把它扩大到不限于朝鲜境内。美国的好战分子杜勒斯等人也不断重复这种狂妄的恫吓。美国的走狗李承晚叫得更凶，他声称要在政治会议举行九十天之后和美国一道退出会议，用武力统一朝鲜。美国已经和他订立了侵略性的军事联盟条约——所谓“共同防御条约”，打算把美国军队长期驻在朝鲜。美国最近不但没有减少它在远东的侵略兵力，而且加派了一个海军陆战队师前来增援。在朝鲜遣返战俘中间，美国违反停战协定扣留了大批应该直接遣返的我方被俘人员。在停战线上的非军事区，美方违反停战协定的事件已达五十多次。与此同时，美国又公开宣布干涉和扩大侵略越南的战争。在美国的远东侵略基地日本，美国正督促它加速重新武装。美国的好战分子之一、反动参议员诺兰最近又到日本、台湾等地进行阴谋活动。在联合国第七届大会上，美国用极端卑鄙横蛮的手段迫使联合国通过了美国一手包办的所谓“十五国提案”，想把政治会议变成另一个交战双方面对面的“板门店谈判”，以便美国能够操纵政治会议，实现杜勒斯和李承晚的九十天后退出政治会议的计划。从这一系列的侵略阴谋活动中，就不难看出，美国正集中力量来阻挠和破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    因而彭德怀司令员向全国人民提出：“当前的任务是巩固朝鲜停战，保证严格遵守停战条款以严防侵略战争的再起，促成政治会议的顺利召开以进一步谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。”
    我们必须提高警惕，充实力量，防止美帝国主义新的挑衅。在实现这一方面的斗争中，我志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员是有了充分的信心和准备的。彭司令员已向祖国人民报告：“中国人民志愿军全军将士将百倍警惕美国好战分子和李承晚集团的阴谋和挑衅，严守自己的阵地，准备随时粉碎敌人任何可能的突然侵犯，完成我们光荣的自卫任务。”为了回答祖国的英雄子弟们这一庄严的宣誓，中央人民政府委员会在给中国人民志愿军的慰问电中说：“全中国人民将以大力进行经济建设，加强国防力量，继续深入地开展抗美援朝运动，来支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。中华人民共和国政府和人民将尽力来帮助英雄的朝鲜人民医治战争创伤，恢复和平生活。”由于全国人民在抗美援朝运动中的努力，我们已经扑灭了烧到祖国门前的战火，争取到了更好的和平环境。现在，我们的条件比以前更有利了，我们的努力必能把祖国的经济建设、国防建设和抗美援朝运动大大推进一步。
    为了开好政治会议，击败美国破坏政治会议的阴谋，我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省李东建副相，已先后致电联合国秘书长，提出对联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的两项决议案的答复，一致驳斥了联合国第七届大会所通过的关于政治会议组成问题的决议是不合理的；重申政治会议应采取停战双方在其他有关国家参加下共同协商的圆桌会议的形式，并建议联合国第八届大会尽速采取步骤来扩大政治会议的成员，使这个会议得以迅速召开。这个答复提出之后，已引起世界舆论的广泛响应。我们和全世界和平人民一道，一致支持周恩来外长和李东建副相的建议，绝不容许美国野心家破坏政治会议的阴谋得逞。
    彭德怀司令员说得对：“必须严正警告美国的好战分子们，如果你们或你们的走狗李承晚集团敢于背信弃义地破坏朝鲜停战协定，再次发动侵略战争，那么，你们就一定会碰得头破血流。你们任何使政治会议流产和遭受破坏的阴谋，都必将遭受朝中人民和世界爱好和平人民最坚决的反对而遭受更严重的失败。”中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，都将以这一句话来警告美国侵略者。
