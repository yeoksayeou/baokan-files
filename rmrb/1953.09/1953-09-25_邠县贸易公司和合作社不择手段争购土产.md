The state-owned trading company and cooperatives in Qiqu of Binxian County, Shaanxi Province, this year resorted to competing for local products by raising grades, causing undue losses to the state. This year, hemp in the county generally had a good harvest. In the main hemp-producing area of Qiqu, in the Shuiliandong and Lianhuachi villages of Qixiang, five hundred and ninety-five mu of hemp land produced more than 70,000 jin of hemp. The Qiqu Supply and Marketing Cooperative had already set up a purchasing station in Shuiliandong for purchasing. Originally, the two cadres at the purchasing station could purchase six to seven hundred jin a day, which was sufficient, but the trading company also set up a purchasing station here, so the hemp purchased daily by one party was divided between the two. The purchasing station of the cooperative complained: "Since the trading company also purchases here, the cooperative's purchase volume has dropped from five or six hundred jin to one or two hundred jin." In order to compete for purchases, the two parties even used the method of raising grades for purchasing. The cooperative graded hemp from farmer Lu Zhizhi as medium grade, and he refused to sell it; he went to the trading company to sell it, and it was initially graded as upper-medium grade, but later, knowing that Lu came from the cooperative, they bought it at the price of the top grade. This fueled the sentiment of some hemp farmers to sell low-quality hemp at high prices. For example, some said: "The trading company and the cooperative are competing for business! If the grading is strict, the cooperative won't be able to sell it, so take it to the trading company to sell it."
    
As for the means of production and daily necessities that hemp farmers need after the autumn harvest, neither the cooperative nor the trading company took care of it. Therefore, the purchasing work wasted efforts and caused confusion, but the supply problem was still not well resolved.

    邠县贸易公司和合作社不择手段争购土产
    今年陕西省邠县七区国营贸易公司与合作社不惜以提高等级办法争购土产，使国家受到不应有的损失。今年该县的麻普遍丰收，主要产麻区七区七乡水濂洞、莲花池两个村五百九十五亩麻地，即产麻七万多斤。七区供销合作社已在水濂洞设立收购站收购。本来收购站两个干部一天收六、七百斤，可以收得过来，可是贸易公司也在这里设了一个收购站，这样就把每天一家收购的麻，两家分收了。合作社收购站不满地说：自贸易公司也在这里收购，合作社的收购量就由五、六百斤，减为一、二百斤。两家为了争购，甚至还用提高等级的办法进行收购。麻农吕志志的麻，合作社给评上中等，他不卖；到贸易公司去卖，开始也评了个上中等，但后来知道吕是由合作社过来的，就按上等价收了。这助长了有些麻农以低麻卖高麻价钱的情绪。如有的说：贸易公司和合作社争买卖哩！把等级放硬些，合作社卖不了，拿到贸易公司去卖。
    至于麻农秋收后，需要供应的生产资料和生活资料，合作社和贸易公司都没有管。因此，收购工作浪费了力量，发生了混乱，可是供应问题仍然没有很好解决。
