Facing Life
— After Viewing the National Chinese Painting Exhibition
Wang Chaowen

The National Chinese Painting Exhibition brings together more than two hundred works by more than two hundred contemporary painters. Many works use real life as their subject matter, depicting the new face of China to varying degrees. These works have definitively answered the question of whether Chinese painting can reflect the new reality. Chinese painters have broken through the narrow circles of inherited routines and changed the conservative situation of imitating the ancients, which is a healthy and progressive trend. Depicting new characters and new landscapes is not only a good intention of Chinese painters, but also an exciting fact. Reflecting reality is a good start, and this start opens up a broad road for the art of Chinese painting, foreshadowing the magnificent prospects of the future. Although these works cannot be said to be perfect, they have already achieved initial victories. This is the glory of Chinese painters and a joy for the people.

These many works are diverse in content and expression. They prove that there are no serious obstacles to using traditional Chinese painting techniques to reflect new things. If these works have any shortcomings, it should be said that it is mainly due to the authors' insufficient feelings and understanding of reality. The exhibited works fully prove that in order to break through the narrow circle of inherited routines and promote the excellent tradition of realism in Chinese painting, the most important thing is to face life (the so-called "learning from nature"). Only on the basis of being familiar with life and understanding life can Chinese painting techniques be properly developed, and can creative skills be enriched. I would like to use "Testing Mom" (by Jiang Yan), a creative work—even the title has the advantages of being attractive, durable, and creating a deep impression—to illustrate the importance of facing life for inheriting and promoting the excellent tradition of realism in Chinese painting.

First of all, let's see where the creativity of "Testing Mom" lies. The author not only chose the common theme of children helping their mothers learn, but also captured the conflict between knowledge and ignorance, and depicted a dramatic plot. The mother being tested is trying to smile, her eyes not on the paper, nor on her daughter, but immersed in the pleasant thought of learning. The daughter makes things difficult for her mother, casually hiding the book by her side, waiting for her mother's answer, without putting on the airs of a little teacher, not concealing that kind of charming and childishness. They are teacher and student, but not ordinary teacher and student; they are mother and daughter, but not simply mother and daughter. In this specific situation, in the love and conflict between mother and daughter, due to the clever arrangement of meaningful, characteristic, and attractive details (the daughter hiding the book and the mother holding the pen, etc.), the identities and mutual relations of the mother and daughter are naturally, simply, reasonably, and appropriately expressed. This work, which depicts the way of life and atmosphere of ordinary Chinese people so specifically, this work, which adapts to the particularity of art in terms of subject matter, this work, which can clearly express the psychology and emotions of the characters, does not need to rely on any written or spoken explanations, and the author's intention is very clear and easy to understand. It is full of the conditions that a work of art must possess—interest, instead of dryly and boringly explaining some phenomena. Its expression is narrative, and also lyrical; it not only clearly tells the audience some correct ideas, but also gives a strong infection from the emotional point of view, which is in line with the characteristics of classical painting: it is both painting and poetry.

Whether the author first had a concrete life impression and then developed the theme, or first had the theme and then sought and enriched the image, whether relying on impression or on conception, these are irrelevant in creation. The problem is that precisely because the author does not ignore this event that is not difficult to encounter but easily overlooked, the author can attach importance to this meaningful and suitable subject matter for painting and understand the great significance it contains, can appreciate the thoughts and emotions of the characters, and thus exert imagination, and deliberate in accordance with the characteristics of the expression of plastic arts, accurately depicting the spiritual state of the mother and daughter, to achieve such an effect. It is also precisely because the author faces life that the necessary conditions for creativity are obtained, and those habits of inherited routines are overcome. We know that the author once indulged in the practice of painting ladies, and for a long time regarded the morbid, weak, and powerless "beauty" as a beautiful thing, but today can create such a moving image of a new character. This major change is not just due to the author's research on Chinese painting brush and ink.

Some people expressed doubts about this work, suspecting that it was a New Year picture. The meaning is that it looks like a New Year picture, not like a Chinese painting; it is more like a New Year picture than a Chinese painting. I think it is not harmful to look like a New Year picture, and New Year pictures can be good Chinese paintings; the "Peddler's Picture" and "Three Sheep Picture" painted by the Song people were not like our New Year pictures today? A good New Year picture or a Chinese painting that looks like a New Year picture still cannot but be regarded as a Chinese painting, not to mention that "Testing Mom" cannot be said to be completely different from the currently popular New Year pictures. Moreover, the styles of Chinese painting should be diverse.

The audience needs diverse forms and diverse styles. The diversity of forms and styles can enrich the lineup of Chinese painting. "Forest" (by Li Xiongcai) chose a corner of the motherland's mountains and rivers, and is a landscape painting praising the motherland; "New Year Greetings to Military Dependents" (by Liu Ziju) positively depicts the life of the liberated people, and is a genre painting praising the motherland. Whether it is layout, brush and ink, or title, the differences between the two are very significant, but both have received good reviews from the audience. Of course, the work "Daylily" (by Shao Yiping) with such refined brush and ink is lovely, and how can the flowers and birds painted with such meticulous brush and ink in "Oriole" (by Wang Shensheng) not be attractive? The description of the characteristics of flowers, birds, and insects, just like "Portraits of Emperors of the Past Dynasties" (Tang Dynasty, by Yan Liben) and "Li Bai Wandering and Singing" (Song Dynasty, by Liang Kai), as the description of the character of the characters, although the brush and ink have the distinction between meticulous and "freehand", they both exert the specialty of Chinese painting techniques. In order to exert the diverse techniques of Chinese painting, the most important thing is to have a deep feeling and understanding of real life like "Testing Mom." We should only base on the content and require a style that adapts to the content, without having to consider its style first.

As a Chinese painting, does "Testing Mom" have no shortcomings? We have no reason to defend its shortcomings, and humble authors are not afraid to point out the shortcomings of their works. Some people think that its color tone is harmonious, but it is not fresh and bright, and the virtual and the real are not distinguished; the characters are vivid, but there are significant problems in anatomy, and the mother's breasts are too low; the picture is concise, and does not accumulate meaningless miscellaneous objects, but in the layout of the blank space, it has not yet shown the plan of Chinese painting layout. If this is a shortcoming, I think it is a secondary shortcoming. The author should overcome these shortcomings, should further study, and fully grasp the special techniques of Chinese painting. But in any case, these shortcomings are not enough to damage the basic success of the work. The audience will never despise its most cherished things because of these shortcomings, the real, vivid, and ingenious description of real life. If we do not focus on this fundamental issue, but only pay attention to "brush and ink interest", then creative works may be ignored, the most fundamental conditions for the development of Chinese painting may be lost, which is not conducive to the future of Chinese painting.

The feeling and understanding of life is an important condition for determining the quality of the content of the work, and also an important condition for the development of techniques. The techniques formed and developed by predecessors in the process of reflecting life are valuable, not because they are old, not only because they have appropriately served their creation, but also because they can be flexibly used to express our current life and the reflection of life in the minds of painters. Since techniques should not and cannot be immutable, then when we face fresh things, we must critically treat the established or our own habitual brush and ink, composition, and mood. We should use and develop the techniques of our predecessors according to the expression of new artistic conceptions, and should not be constrained by them. Many works with real life as the subject matter still have shortcomings to a greater or lesser extent. The soldiers appearing on the screen became pale-faced scholars, and the female soldiers were just disguised ladies, and the ancient poets or women who loved the volunteers carried a stage accent like an unsuccessful actor. Such an image has to lose the charm that Chinese painting should have, and the audience has no way to gain the joy of appreciation. The reason for this shortcoming cannot be found only from the author's brush and ink cultivation, because the technology of brush and ink is not bad. We know that Chinese painting, like other arts, must be more than just imitating nature, but should be a kind of creation. However, like the creation of poetry, creation is first of all the richness of life knowledge. "Poets must have the intention to despise external things, so they can order the wind and moon as servants. They must also have the intention to value external things, so they can share sorrows and joys with flowers and birds." (Wang Guowei) If there is no appreciation for the spiritual state of the new characters, the spiritual state of the new characters cannot be imagined, it is difficult to properly use the established techniques to create the image of the new characters accurately, vividly, and movingly.

Some works have not yet organically combined the characters with the environment, which is mainly due to the lack of full understanding of life. Works with the theme of surveying mineral deposits clearly show the uncoordinated situation between the characters and the environment. As the discoverers of underground resources, the fighters who conquer nature and build the motherland (the survey team) have become "elegant scholars" wearing modern clothes on the screen, which is not just a problem with the characters themselves. Due to the stereotyped landscape painting method of the background, the landscape as the background of the survey team's actions constitutes a tranquil atmosphere like "Picture of a Poet in Seclusion" (Ming Dynasty, by Tang Yin), the background becomes an object for recreation, thus making the survey team's actions more unclear, the character's spiritual state is blurred, and the theme of praising the survey work is diluted. This lacks the advantages of ancient works such as "Spring Outing Picture" (attributed to Zhan Ziqian of the Sui Dynasty), "First Snow on the River" (Five Dynasties, by Zhao Gan), and "Solitary Fishing in the Cold River" (Song Dynasty, by Ma Yuan), etc. The wind, rain, and all natural phenomena in the above ancient works, whether concrete or indirect, are adapted to the spiritual state of the characters, and thus are conducive to the elucidation of the theme. The style of not adapting the form to the subject matter, but of accommodating the subject matter to the form, not only does not conform to the current reality, but also does not conform to the excellent tradition of classical art. The author himself excuses or does not understand the reason for this disconnection between characters and environment, mainly because the author has not fully recognized the characteristics of the subject matter he wants to describe.

Similarly, the theme of reflecting the survey of mineral deposits, "Morning in the Qilian Mountains" (by Dong Xiwen) produced different results. If measured according to the ideal Chinese painting, the technical shortcomings of this work are very obvious. The texture of the rocks, especially the texture of the shaded side of the rocks, clearly lacks the characteristics of clarity, refinement, and rich changes of excellent landscape paintings, so it is not suitable for close viewing, and close viewing will show that the texture of the rocks is insufficient. However, these shortcomings have not drowned out its preciousness. We can say without exaggeration that this kind of work is a good work that inherits the excellent tradition of Chinese classical realism. In terms of the description of the relationship between characters, characters, and the environment (which is more important than the problem of brush and ink), it follows the characteristics of anti-ancient works such as "Spring Outing Picture" and other works. The characters are painted realistically, and the mutual relationship between the characters and the environment is handled naturally and accurately. The rocks are not pieced together, but are an organic component that is conducive to the elucidation of the theme. It is the object of the surveyor's attack, and itself shows the characteristics of owning underground treasures. This description of the natural environment will not cause misunderstanding, will not make people regard it as an object of recreation, and thus avoids the surveyor being seen as a poet and painter, which must be affirmed. Why can people be described naturally and accurately, and why can the relationship between people and the environment be properly handled, can only be answered from the author's feeling and understanding of "nature" (objective reality). It can be seen that a deep feeling and understanding of the situation and nature of objective things is a necessary condition to ensure the development of the excellent tradition of national art, the formation of healthy aesthetic concepts, the change of the style of inherited routines, and the avoidance of the separation of content and form. It is inevitable to be stiff at the beginning, but only facing life is the most fundamental way to develop Chinese painting, and also the only correct road.

This short article does not introduce other more successful works one by one, of course not because other works are not worth introducing. For example, "Harvest" (by Tang Yun), "Magnolia" (by Zhao Mengzhu), "Dad Went to Fight Lao Jiang" (by Huang Zhou) and "Mandarin Ducks" (by Wang Xuetao), "Landscape" (by Qi Gong) etc. that have been introduced, each has different advantages. This short article mentions the shortcomings of some works, of course not because these shortcomings cannot be overcome. The phenomenon of smooth sailing is unlikely to be a fact, and shortcomings are difficult to avoid. As long as we move forward forever, continue to promote the excellent tradition of realism in Chinese painting, prepare the necessary conditions for understanding life and reflecting life, and adopt a humble, tenacious, and serious attitude towards life, we dare to predict that brilliant Chinese painting works will continue to be produced, and the next Chinese painting exhibition will definitely be able to achieve higher achievements.

    面向生活
    ——全国国画展览会观后
    王朝闻
    全国国画展览会，集中了当代两百多位画家的两百多件作品。有不少作品以现实生活作题材，在不同程度上描绘了中国新面貌。这些作品已经肯定地回答了国画能不能反映新的现实的问题。国画家们突破了因袭程式的狭窄圈子，改变了以模仿古人为能事的保守状况，这是健康的进步的倾向。描写新人物新风景，不只是国画家良好的意图，而且成为令人兴奋的事实。反映现实是良好的开端，这一开端开辟了国画艺术的广阔道路，预示着未来的壮丽的远景。这些作品虽然不能说已经十全十美，可是已经获得初步的胜利。这是国画家的光荣，也是人民的喜事。
    这许多作品，内容是多样的，表现方式也是多样的。它们证明：运用传统的国画技术反映新事物，没有严重的障碍。如果说这些作品还有缺点，应该说主要由于作者对于现实的感受和理解不够。展出的作品充分证明：为了突破因袭程式的狭窄圈子，发扬国画现实主义的优良传统，最重要的是面向生活（即所谓“师造化”）。只有在熟悉生活和理解生活的基础上，国画技术才能够获得适当的发挥，也才能够丰富创作的技巧。我想就“考考妈妈”（姜燕作）这一富于创造性的——连标题都具备了吸引人、经得看和造成较深印象的长处的作品，说明面向生活对于承继和发扬国画现实主义优良传统的重要。
    首先，我们看“考考妈妈”的创造性表现在什么地方。作者不仅是选择了孩子帮助母亲学习这一带普遍性的题材，而且抓住了知与无知的冲突，描写了富于戏剧性的情节。正在被考的妈妈，要笑不笑，眼光不落在纸张上，也不对着女儿，沉入愉快的学习的思考里。女儿难为妈妈，顺手把书本藏在身边，等待妈妈的回答，没有摆着小先生的架子，不掩饰那种爱娇和稚气。她们是师生，可不是一般的师生；是母女，可不是单纯的母女。在这一种特定的情势之下，在母女的爱和冲突之中，由于有意义的、富于特征性和吸引力的细节（女儿藏书和母亲握笔的姿式等等）的巧妙安排，结果是自然地朴质地合情合理地表现了母女的身分和相互关系。这一把普通中国人民的生活方式和生活气氛描写得如此具体的作品，这一在取材上适应了美术的特殊性的作品，这一能够明确表现人物的心理和情绪的作品，不必依靠任何文字的或口头的解释，作者所要表现的思想十分鲜明，容易领会。它充满了艺术品必须具备的条件——趣味，不是干燥乏味地说明一些现象。它的表现方式是叙事的，同时也是抒情的；它不仅明确地告诉了观众一些正确的观念，它是从情感上给予有力的感染，正好符合古典绘画的特长：是画也是诗。
    不论作者是先有具体的生活印象再发展主题，还是先有主题再寻求和充实形象，不论是依靠印象还是依靠构思，这些，在创作上都无关紧要。问题在于：正因为作者不忽略这种不难遇见而容易被人忽略的事件，作者能够重视这种有意义而又宜于作画的题材和理解它所包含的重大意义，能够体会人物的思想和情绪，从而发挥想像，按照造型艺术的表现方式的特点进行推敲，确切地描写了母女的精神状态，才获得这样的效果。也正因为作者面向生活，才获得创造性的必要条件，才克服那些因袭程式的习惯。我们知道：作者曾经沉溺在仕女画的练习里，长时期把病态的软弱无力的“美人”当成美的事物，可是今天能够创造出这样的动人的新人物的形象。这种重大的变化，何尝仅仅是由于作者对于国画笔墨的钻研。
    有人对这一作品表示怀疑，怀疑它是不是年画。意思就是说：它像年画，不像国画；与其说它是国画，不如说它是年画。我以为像年画没有什么损害，年画可以是好的国画；宋朝人画的“货郎图”和“三羊图”之类，在当时何尝不像我们今天的年画？好的年画或像年画的国画，仍然不能不算是国画，何况“考考妈妈”与现在流行的年画也还不能说没有一点区别。而且国画的样式应该是多种多样的。
    观众需要多种多样的形式，多种多样的风格。形式和风格的多样，才能够丰富国画的阵容。“森林”（黎雄才作）选择了祖国山河的一角，是歌颂祖国的山水画；“给军属拜年”（刘子久作）正面描写解放了的人民的生活，是歌颂祖国的风俗画。不论是布局、笔墨和标题，两者区别是很显著的，然而都获得观众的好评。“萱草”（邵一萍作）那样笔墨洗炼的作品，当然可爱，“黄鹂”（汪慎生作）那样工细的笔墨所画出来的花鸟，又何尝不吸引人？作为花、鸟和昆虫的特点的描写，正如“历代帝王像”（唐、阎立本作）和“李白行吟图”（宋、梁楷作）那样，作为人物性格的描写，笔墨虽有工整与“写意”的区别，却都发挥了国画技法的专长。为了发挥国画多种多样的技巧，最重要的是像“考考妈妈”那样，对于现实生活作深切感受和理解。我们只有根据内容，要求与内容相适应的样式，用不着首先考虑它的样式。
    作为国画来看，“考考妈妈”是不是没有缺点呢？我们没有理由为它的缺点辩护，虚心的作者不怕指出作品的缺点。有人认为：它的色调调和，可是显得不清新不爽朗，虚实不分；人物生动，可是在解剖上有显著的毛病，母亲的乳房太低；画面简练，不作无意义的杂物的堆积，可是在空白的布置上，还没有显示国画布局的计划性。如果说这是缺点，我以为这是次要的缺点。作者应该克服这些缺点，应该进一步学习，充分掌握国画的特殊技法。可是不论如何，这些缺点不足以损害作品基本上的成功。观众绝不因为这些缺点而轻视它那最可珍爱的东西，现实生活的真实的生动的巧妙的描写。如果不从这一根本问题着眼，仅仅是讲究“笔情墨趣”，那么创造性的作品可能被忽视，发展国画的最根本的条件可能丧失，于国画的前途不利。
    对于生活的感受和理解，是决定作品内容好坏的重要条件，也是发展技巧的重要条件。前人在反映生活过程中形成和发展起来的技巧，所以可贵，不在于它古老，不只是因为它曾经适当地为他们的创作服务，而且可以被灵活地加以运用，运用来表现我们当前的生活和生活在画家头脑中的反映。既然技巧不应该也不可能是一成不变的，那么，当我们面对新鲜事物，必须批判地对待既成的或者自己习惯的笔墨、章法和情调。对于前人的技巧，应该是按照表现新的意境来使用它和发展它，而不应该被它所拘束。许多以现实生活为题材的作品，或多或少还存在着缺点。战士出现在画面上成了白面书生，女战士不过是化了装的闺秀，古诗人或热爱志愿军的妇女，带着一股不成功的演员那种舞台腔。这样的形象，不得不丧失国画应有的魅力，观众无从获得欣赏的喜悦。其所以形成这种缺点，决不可以仅仅从作者的笔墨修养上找原因，因为在笔墨的技术上都是不坏的。我们知道：国画，如同其他艺术一样，必须不止于模仿自然，而应该是一种创造。然而如同诗的创造一样，创造，首先是生活知识的丰富。“诗人必有轻视外物之意，故能以奴仆命风月。又必须有重视外物之意，故能与花鸟共忧乐。”（王国维语）如果对于新人物的精神状态毫无体会，新人物的精神状态无从想像，很难适当运用既成的技法，确切生动和动人地创造出新人物的形象。
    有些作品还没有使人物与环境有机地结合起来，这主要由于没有充分理解生活。以勘察矿藏为题材的作品，分明显出人物与环境不很协调的状况。作为地下富源的发现者，征服自然、为建设祖国的战斗员（勘察队），在画面上成了穿着现代服装的“雅士”，这不只是人物本身的问题。由于背景那种定型的山水画法，使作为勘察队的行动背景的山水，构成了像“诗隐图”（明、唐寅作）那种恬静的气氛，背景就成了供游乐的对象，因而更加使得勘察队的行动不明确，人物精神状态模糊，赞美勘察工作的主题被冲淡。这就缺少如“游春图”
    （传隋展子虔作）“江行初雪”（五代、赵干作）“寒江独钓”（宋、马远作）等等古代作品的好处。上述古代作品中的风、雨和一切自然现象，不论是具体描写或间接描写，都是和人物的精神状态相适应的，因而都有利于主题的阐明。而那些不是形式适应题材、而是题材迁就形式的作风，不仅不符合当前的实际，也不符合古典艺术的优良传统。作者自己原谅或不了解这种人物与环境脱节的原因，主要是由于作者还没有充分认识它所要描写的题材的特征所在。
    同样是反映勘察矿藏的题材，“祁连山的早晨”（董希文作）就产生了不同的效果。如果按照理想的国画来衡量，这一作品在技法上的缺点是很明显的。山石的皴法，特别是山石阴面的皴法，分明缺少卓越山水画那种明确、洗炼和富于变化的特点，因而不宜近看，近看就显得山石的质感不足。可是，这些缺点没有淹没它的可贵之处。我们可以毫不夸张地说：这种作品，正是承继了中国古典现实主义的优良传统的好作品。就人物、人物和环境的关系的描写（这较之笔墨问题更重要）而论，它追随了反古人作品如“游春图”等等作品的特长。它的人物画得真实，人物和环境的相互关系处理得自然和确切。山石不是拼凑上去的，它是有利于主题的阐明的有机组成部分。它是勘察者进攻的对象，本身就显示着拥有地下宝藏的特点。这种自然环境的描写，不致引起误会，不致使人把它当成游乐的对象，因而也就避免勘察者被人看成骚人墨客，这是必须肯定的。为什么能够自然、确切地描写人，为什么能够适当处理人物和环境的关系，只能从作者对于“造化”（客观实际）的感受和理解得到回答。由此可见：对于客观事物的状况和性质的深切底感受和理解，正是保证能够发挥民族艺术的优良传统、形成健康的审美观念、改变因袭陈套的作风、避免内容与形式脱离的必要条件。开始难免生硬，可是只有面向生活，才是发展国画最根本的办法，也是唯一正确的道路。
    这篇短文没有一一介绍其他比较成功的作品，当然不是以为其他作品不值得介绍。例如“丰收”（唐云作），“玉兰”（赵梦珠），“爹去打老蒋”（黄胄作）以及曾经被介绍过的“鸳鸯”（王雪涛作）“山水”（启功作）等等，各有不同的优点。这篇短文提到一些作品的缺点，当然不是以为这些缺点无法克服。一帆风顺的现象不大会是事实，缺点很难避免。只要永远前进，继续发扬国画的现实主义优良传统，为认识生活和反映生活准备必要条件，对生活采取谦虚的坚韧的严肃的态度，我们敢于预言：光辉灿烂的国画作品将不断产生，再一次的国画展览会一定能够获得更高的成就。
