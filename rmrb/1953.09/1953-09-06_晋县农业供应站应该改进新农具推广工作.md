    Jin County Agricultural Supply Station Should Improve the Promotion of New Agricultural Tools
    Readers Ji Zhibin and Liu Guangzhi wrote: Last spring, Feng Falou and Zhu Baozhen, two cadres from the Jin County Agricultural Supply Station in Hebei Province, promoted walking plows in Liucun, Fifth District of the county. They gathered all the mutual aid team leaders in the village into a large courtyard. Zhu Baozhen placed a bench at the doorway to block the exit, and Feng Falou announced the meeting. He began by saying, "We are from the Agricultural Supply Station, specializing in the promotion of new agricultural tools. Promoting walking plows is a political task, walking plows are the direction of development, and mutual aid teams are new-style organizations, so there must be new-style walking plows within the teams..." After speaking, he announced: Each mutual aid team must borrow at least one walking plow. The meeting was silent. After waiting for a long time, mutual aid team leader Gao Xilin braced himself and said, "Then our team will borrow one!" Zhu Baozhen immediately praised him greatly, saying, "See! He really has political awareness." After another long silence, another mutual aid team leader, Gao Xixiang, said, "Others are not speaking, we don't want to be stuck here, so we'll take one too!" It was getting late, and the farmers had worked all day and wanted to go home to sleep, so they requested, "Comrade Feng, let's do this! We can't decide for all the team members. Let us go back and discuss it with the team members and talk about it tomorrow." Zhu Baozhen said, "Forget it! You're shirking responsibility for such a small matter, it's not like it's harming you." Later, when it was really late, they said, "You must not break your promise tomorrow." The mutual aid team leaders were forced to temporarily put together several "large mutual aid teams" of fifteen to twenty households and borrowed seventeen walking plows. Most of these plows that they lent to the farmers are still hanging in doorways, and six of them haven't even had their original straw wrapping removed. This spring, Feng Falou again assigned sixteen walking plows to the mutual aid teams in Zhoucun. Because they used this method to "promote" walking plows, many villages in the county, such as Changzhao, Beibaitan, and Dongsugu, have many walking plows lying unattended in village offices or other places. Farmers even let the walking plows get rained on in the open.
    The Jin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party should thoroughly investigate this issue, urge the county unit responsible for promoting new agricultural tools to earnestly improve its work, and vigorously teach farmers the technology of using new agricultural tools, so that the new agricultural tools "promoted" in the past can play their due role. As for agricultural tools that farmers cannot use or are unwilling to use and request to return, the Jin County Agricultural Supply Station should allow them to be taken back, cancel their debts, and waive interest.

### 晋县农业供应站应该改进新农具推广工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    晋县农业供应站应该改进新农具推广工作
    读者纪志彬、刘广志来信：去年春天，河北省晋县农业供应站封法禄，朱宝珍两个干部在该县五区留村推广步犁。他们把全村的互助组长集合到一个大院子里，朱宝珍弄了条凳子坐在门口挡住出路，封法禄就宣布开会。他首先说：“俺们是农业供应站的，专门推广新式农具；推广步犁是政治任务，步犁是发展方向，互助组是新式的组织，组内就必须有新式步犁……。”讲完后，他就宣布：每个互助组最低得贷一部步犁。当时会场上寂然无声。等了半天，互助组长高喜林硬着头皮说：“那么俺们组贷一架吧！”朱宝珍马上大加表扬说：“看！人家真是有政治认识。”又沉默了好久，另一个互助组长高喜祥说：“别人不作声，不要又走不了，俺们也来一架吧！”天不早了，农民们干了一天活，都要想回家睡觉，就要求说：“封同志，这么办吧！全体组员的事，俺们也作不了主；让我们回去和组员们商量一下，明天再说吧。”朱宝珍说：“算了吧！这点小事你们还推卸责任，这又不是害你们的事情。”后来，天实在晚了，他们才说：“明天可一定不能失信。”逼得互助组长们没有办法，结果临时凑了几个十五家到二十家的“大互助组”，贷了十七架步犁。他们这样贷给农民的步犁，到现在大部都挂在门洞上，甚至有六架连原封的稻草还一丝未动。今年春天，封法禄又在周村向各互助组摊派了步犁十六部。由于他们用这种方法“推广”步犁，该县长召、北白滩、东宿等村都有不少步犁在村公所或其它地方扔着没人管，甚至在下雨时农民还任凭步犁在露天受雨淋。
    中共晋县委员会应该彻底检查这一问题，督促该县负责推广新农具的单位切实改进工作，并且大力向农民传授使用新农具的技术，使过去“推广”出去的新农具能够发挥它应有的作用。至于农民不能使用或不愿使用而要求退还的农具，晋县农业供应站应该准予收回，取消其债务，并免计利息。
