Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 31st: TASS, Berlin, August 30th: The German News Agency published the following statement from the Press Office of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic:

On August 27th, Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, and Deputy Prime Minister Walter Ulbricht received Max Reimann, Chairman of the German Communist Party and member of the Bundestag. Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl spoke in detail with Max Reimann about the talks held in Moscow between the Soviet government and the delegation of the government of the German Democratic Republic, and the agreements reached. They exchanged opinions on this matter. Max Reimann said that the Soviet government's note to the three Western powers on August 15th, as well as the results of the talks between the delegation of the government of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet government, opened up broad avenues for a peaceful solution to the German question. If the people of West Germany express their will in the upcoming political decisions to end the Bonn and Paris war treaty policies adopted by the Adenauer government and to overthrow Adenauer's rule, their words will play a decisive role.
