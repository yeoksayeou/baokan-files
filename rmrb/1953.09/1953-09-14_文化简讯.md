	Five-Act Historical Poetic Drama "Qu Yuan" Premieres in Beijing
	To commemorate the 2,230th anniversary of the death of the great patriotic poet Qu Yuan, the China Youth Art Theatre is staging Guo Moruo's five-act historical poetic drama "Qu Yuan" at the Beijing Youth Palace Theatre, starting from September 12th. Chen Liting directs, and Ma Sicong composes the music.
	The play portrays the brilliant image of Qu Yuan, the great poet, thinker, and statesman of ancient China, and his noble qualities of loving his country, his people, and the truth. Throughout his life, he waged an unyielding struggle to support the light and oppose the darkness, to uphold justice and oppose evil, and finally, unable to bear to see the devastation of his country and the suffering of his people, he drowned himself in the Miluo River.
	In 1942, "Qu Yuan" was first performed in Chongqing. At that time, patriotic people were generally subjected to severe persecution under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The performance of "Qu Yuan" had a great political impact on the broad masses of the audience. Now, in order to present Qu Yuan's image more vividly to the people, the author has made some revisions and additions to the original play, focusing on expressing Qu Yuan's populism and his patriotism. Before the premiere, the China Youth Art Theatre prepared for a long time, and all the staff members studied Qu Yuan's deeds, Qu Yuan's thoughts, his works, and the historical background of Qu Yuan's era.
	
	Jiangsu Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau Organizes and Studies Local Operas
	Huaihai Opera, Huaiyang Opera, and Jianghuai Opera are the main types of operas in Jiangsu Province, with a large audience. Since liberation, they have been gradually reformed, but there are still many shortcomings. The Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau recently led the cultural and educational departments of various special districts to organize relevant forces to conduct investigations and studies on these operas.
	In June, the Huaiyin Special District Cultural and Educational Section organized a group to go to the Huaihai Experimental Opera Troupe to start investigation and research. So far, the history and activities of Huaihai Opera have been investigated and collated, and 32 programs, including the old operas "Da Tao Hua", "Jin Dao Ji", "Si Pai Lou", and "Da Hong Shan", and 25 excellent small programs such as the original duet operas "San Zhuan Lian", "Zhang Sijie Luo Fan", and "Ma Deng" have been investigated; 24 programs such as "Luo Xie Ji", "Yanmen Pass", and "Mai You Lang Du Zhan Hua Kui Nv" have been initially reviewed and revised. Through the music workers, technical textual descriptions of opera music percussion, rhythm, etc. were recorded. Preliminary opinions were also put forward on the reform work of this opera. Huaihai opera tunes are particularly rich, with more than 50 kinds, providing valuable information for drama workers.
	The Yangzhou Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles organized literary and art workers and artists to jointly investigate, collate, and study Huaiyang Opera. Twenty-three old scripts have been copied and collected, and the processing of "Little Nun Going Down the Mountain" and "Water Flooding Jinshan" has been completed. In terms of Pinghua (storytelling), the historical development, transmission and learning methods, the characteristics of the art form, and the rise and fall of the art form have been investigated, and its development prospects are currently being studied. The tunes of Huaiyang Opera have been completely recorded.
	The investigation of Jianghuai Opera has also begun, and the original programs of Jianghuai Opera, such as "Xiao Fang Qing" and "Wang Qingming Hetong Ji", are now being recorded and collated.

    五幕历史诗剧“屈原”在京公演
    中国青年艺术剧院为了纪念伟大的爱国诗人屈原逝世二千二百三十周年，九月十二日起在北京青年宫剧场演出郭沫若的五幕历史诗剧“屈原”。由陈鲤庭导演，马思聪作曲。
    该剧刻划了中国古代伟大的诗人、思想家和政治家屈原的光辉形象，和他的爱祖国、爱人民、爱真理的崇高品质。他一生为拥护光明反对黑暗、拥护正义反对邪恶进行了不屈的斗争，终于因不忍看到祖国的残破、民生的多难而自沉于汨罗江。
    一九四二年，“屈原”曾在重庆初次演出，当时，爱国人士在国民党反动统治下普遍受到重重迫害。“屈原”的演出在广大观众中产生了很大的政治影响。现在，为了使屈原的形象更鲜明地呈现在人民面前，作者将原剧作了一些修改和补充，着重表现屈原的人民性及其爱国主义精神。中国青年艺术剧院在排演之前，作了长时期的准备，所有工作人员对屈原事迹、屈原思想及其作品、屈原的时代背景都作了研究和学习。
      江苏省文化事业管理局整理研究地方剧种
    淮海戏、淮扬戏和江淮戏是江苏省主要的几种剧种，拥有广大观众，解放以来经过逐步改革，但缺点尚多。江苏省人民政府文化事业管理局最近领导了各专区文教科组织有关方面的力量，对这些剧种从事调查整理工作。
      淮阴专署文教科于六月份组织了一批力量，到淮海实验剧团，着手调查整理。到目前为止，整理了淮海戏的沿革及活动情况，调查了旧剧“大套花”、“金刀记”、“四牌楼”、“大红山”等三十二个节目，原始的对子戏“三转脸”、“张四姐落凡”、“骂灯”等二十五个优秀的小型节目；初步审改了“罗鞋记”、“雁门关”、“卖油郎独占花魁女”等二十四个节目。通过了音乐工作者记录了戏曲音乐锣鼓点，韵律等技术性的文字说明。另对该剧种的改革工作亦提出初步意见。淮海戏曲调特别丰富，有五十余种，对戏剧工作者提供了宝贵的资料。
      扬州市文联组织了文艺工作者和艺人共同进行淮扬戏的调查、整理和研究，已抄录和搜集了二十三个旧脚本，并完成了“小尼姑下山”、“水漫金山”的加工。在评话方面调查了历史发展简况、传授和学习方式、艺术形式的特点、盛衰情况，现正研究其发展前途。淮扬剧的曲调，已记录完毕。
    对江淮剧的调查也已开始，现在正记载整理江淮剧的原始节目“小方青”、“王清明合同记”等。
