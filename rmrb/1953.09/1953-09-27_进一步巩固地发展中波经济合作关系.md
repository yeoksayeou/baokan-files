    Further Consolidate and Develop Sino-Polish Economic Cooperation
    The Polish People's Republic Economic Exhibition has opened in Beijing. This economic exhibition is the largest exhibition held abroad by the Polish People's Republic. It vividly demonstrates the splendid achievements of People's Poland in economic construction over the past nine years and specifically embodies the close relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation between the people of China and Poland in political, economic, and cultural fields.
    We warmly welcome the holding of this Polish Economic Exhibition and firmly believe that this exhibition will play a significant role in further developing Sino-Polish economic cooperation, strengthening trade ties, promoting the exchange of cultural and scientific and technological knowledge, and promoting the friendly unity of the people of China and Poland.
    The achievements of Poland's economic construction are of profound significance to the people of our country, who are actively carrying out the Five-Year Plan. Before World War II, Poland was an agricultural country that suffered severe damage from Hitler's German troops during the war. However, in the nine years since liberation, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and its leader, Chairman Bierut, and with the selfless and vigorous assistance of the Soviet Union, the Polish people have displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm, not only quickly healing the wounds of war but also rapidly developing industrial and agricultural production, making People's Poland an industrial-agricultural country. After completing the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule and laying the foundation for the solid development of the people's economy, the Polish people are now striving to complete the Six-Year Plan to lay the foundation for a socialist economy. The current level of industrial production in Poland is more than three times that of the bourgeois rule era; agricultural production has also increased significantly compared to pre-war levels. In particular, the production of heavy industry has developed even more rapidly. The production of coal, steel, and electricity has increased to three times the pre-war level, making it one of the countries with high output in Europe. Calculated on a per capita basis, Poland's industrial products now exceed those of capitalist countries like Italy and are close to the production levels of France and the United Kingdom.
    The various exquisite exhibits at this economic exhibition demonstrate the brilliant victories achieved by the Polish people in economic construction. The speed of growth and development of the Polish people's economic construction cannot be matched by any capitalist country. This once again irrefutably proves that the socialist and people's democratic systems are far superior to the decadent capitalist system.
    We, the Chinese people, are working hard to industrialize our motherland, and we urgently need to learn from the advanced scientific and technological experiences of the Soviet Union and other fraternal people's democracies. This exhibition is a good opportunity for us to learn from People's Poland.
    Since China and Poland signed their first trade agreement on February 28, 1950, they have begun regular exchanges of goods. In January 1951, they further signed agreements on the exchange of goods and payments, shipping, exchange of mail and parcels, and telecommunications. In April, they signed a cultural cooperation agreement, establishing a broad and sincere relationship of mutual assistance, cooperation, and mutual trust in political, economic, cultural, and other fields.
    Due to this friendly cooperation, our country has obtained from Poland some of the machinery and equipment, chemical raw materials, and daily necessities required for economic construction. Poland also supplies our country with complete sets of equipment for certain factories. Poland has also obtained from our country various minerals, animal products, and industrial raw materials such as cotton, as well as edible oils, tobacco, tea, food, and other daily necessities needed for their socialist construction. In 1950, only two non-scheduled ships traveled between the two countries. In 1951, the Sino-Polish Shipping Company was established, greatly developing the transportation of goods between the two countries. Now, about thirty ships regularly travel between the ports of the two countries, and the variety and turnover of goods exchanged between the two countries are constantly expanding. In 1953, the trade volume between China and Poland increased more than threefold compared to 1950.
    The increasing prosperity and development of the economies of China and Poland not only guarantee the ever-growing needs of the people of China and Poland in production and life but will also inevitably continue to promote the realization of the economic construction plans of the two countries, guide the economies of the two countries to further prosperity and upsurge, and thus greatly strengthen and consolidate the position of the democratic world market in the entire world economy.
    With the gradual implementation of our country's Five-Year Plan and the rapid development of our country's production and construction, our country's sales market will expand year by year. It will not only accommodate more industrial products but also need to further develop trade with various countries around the world, especially the need to develop trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries.
    Our country's economic and trade relations with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries are constantly developing by leaps and bounds. The proportion of the total trade volume between our country and the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries in our country's total foreign trade has increased from 26 percent in 1950 to 78.9 percent in 1952. The proportion this year will be much larger than in any previous year. In particular, the sincere and selfless fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union to our country has greatly helped the recovery and development of our economy, enabling our country's industrial production to rapidly recover and exceed the pre-liberation level, and smoothly begin the construction work of the Five-Year Plan.
    The Polish Economic Exhibition is the third large-scale industrial exhibition held in our country by a European people's democratic country. Starting last December, the Hungarian People's Republic Exhibition was held in various parts of our country. Starting this April, the German Democratic Republic Industrial Exhibition was held in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. These exhibitions have been warmly welcomed by the vast number of viewers in our country. They have had a positive effect on our people's understanding of the achievements of economic construction in fraternal countries and learning advanced experiences in industrial production in fraternal countries. These exhibitions have enhanced our people's confidence in the struggle to build our great motherland and defend world peace, and have gained practical internationalist education, thereby further strengthening the friendly unity of our people with the people of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries.
    The economic cooperation relations among the countries of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union are being consolidated and developed on the basis of the internationalist spirit of complete equality and mutual benefit. The basis of this cooperation is mutual assistance and the desire to seek common economic upsurges. Therefore, this economic cooperation relationship is unbreakable. At the same time, because the economic system of the countries in the peace and democracy camp eliminates the possibility of economic crises and other ills of the capitalist economic system, and has abundant human and natural resources to fully guarantee economic development, planned economy enables countries to rationally utilize these resources and accelerate the expansion of production. Therefore, it guarantees that the democratic world market will inevitably move forward along the road of prosperity and development. For several years, American imperialism has been oppressing various countries in the capitalist world to implement an economic "blockade" against the Soviet Union, China, and European people's democratic countries, attempting to economically encircle these countries. However, the American imperialists have miscalculated, because in fact, it has deepened the economic crisis in the capitalist world and promoted the consolidation of the democratic world market.
    The economic cooperation relationship between the people of China and Poland is a part of the entire democratic world market. Any achievements our two peoples have made on the economic front mean the strengthening of the economic power of the world democratic, peace, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. We hope that through the Polish People's Republic Economic Exhibition, the people of the two countries will be more closely united like brothers, and with the great and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, strive to further consolidate and develop the economic cooperation relationship between the people of China and Poland.

### 进一步巩固地发展中波经济合作关系

    进一步巩固地发展中波经济合作关系
    波兰人民共和国经济展览会在北京开幕了。这次经济展览会是波兰人民共和国在国外举办的规模最大的一次展览会。它生动地显示了人民波兰九年来在经济建设方面的辉煌成就，具体地表现了中波两国人民在政治、经济、文化上互助合作的亲密关系。
    我们热烈欢迎这次波兰经济展览会的举办，并深信这个展览会对于进一步发展中波两国经济合作、加强贸易联系，促进文化和科学技术知识的交流以及中波两国人民的友好团结，都将发挥巨大的作用。
    波兰经济建设的成就，对于正在积极进行着五年计划建设的我国人民，是具有深刻的意义的。波兰在第二次大战以前是一个农业国，在战争期间遭受到希特勒德国军队的严重破坏。但是，解放以后的九年来，在波兰统一工人党及其领袖贝鲁特主席的领导下，在苏联无私的大力援助之下，波兰人民发挥了高度的劳动热情，不仅迅速地医治了战争的创伤，而且飞快地发展了工农业生产，使人民波兰成为了一个工业—农业国。波兰人民在提前完成了三年计划，奠定人民经济的巩固发展基础之后，现正为完成奠定社会主义经济基础的六年计划而奋斗。现在波兰的工业生产水平已达到资产阶级统治时代的三倍以上；农业生产量也比战前增加了许多。特别是重工业的生产，发展更加迅速。煤、钢和电力的生产量已经增加到战前的三倍，而成为欧洲高度产量国家之一。若以平均人口计算，现在波兰的工业产品已经超过像意大利这样的资本主义国家，而接近于法国和英国的生产水平。
    这次经济展览会上的各种精良的展览品，都说明了波兰人民在经济建设中所取得的光辉胜利。波兰人民经济建设这种增长和发展的速度，是任何资本主义国家所绝对赶不上的。这再一次无可辩驳地证明了社会主义和人民民主制度远远胜过腐朽的资本主义制度。
    我们中国人民为了祖国的工业化，正在紧张地努力奋斗，我们迫切需要学习苏联的、各人民民主兄弟国家的先进的科学技术经验。这个展览会正是我们向人民波兰学习的一个良好机会。
    中波两国自从一九五○年二月二十八日签订第一个贸易协定的时候起，就开始了定期的货物交换。一九五一年一月更签订了货物交换及付款协定、航运协定、互换邮件及包裹协定、电信协定，四月又签订了文化合作协定，使两国间在政治、经济、文化等各方面建立了广泛的真诚的互助合作、互相信任的亲密关系。
    由于这种友好的合作，使我国从波兰取得了部分的经济建设所必需的机器设备、化工原料及人民的日用必需品，并且还由波兰供给我国某些工厂的成套设备；波兰也从我国获得了他们进行社会主义建设所需要的各种矿产、畜产和棉花等工业原料以及油脂、烟、茶、食品等民用必需品。在一九五○年的时候，两国间只有两艘不定期航行的轮船来往航运，一九五一年成立了中波轮船公司，因而大大地发展两国间的货物运输，现在已有约三十艘轮船定期航行于两国间的港口，两国间货物交换的品种和运转额正不断的扩大。一九五三年我国与波兰之间的贸易额，已较一九五○年增加了三倍多。
    中波两国间经济的日益繁荣和发展，不仅保证了中波两国人民在生产上和生活上不断增长的需要，而且必然会不断地促进两国经济建设计划的实现，引导两国经济进一步繁荣和高涨，因而大大地加强和巩固民主世界市场在整个世界经济中的地位。
    随着我国五年计划的逐步实施，我国生产建设事业的迅速发展，我国的销售市场将会逐年扩大。它不仅将更多容纳各种工业生产品，并且需要进一步发展与世界各国的贸易，特别是需要发展和苏联、各人民民主国家间的贸易。
    我国与苏联和各人民民主国家间的经济贸易关系，正在不断地突飞猛进地发展着。我国对苏联和人民民主国家的贸易总额，在我国对外贸易总额中的比重，已经从一九五○年的百分之二十六增加到一九五二年的百分之七十八·九。今年所占的比重将会比过去任何一年都要大得多。特别是苏联对我国的真诚无私的兄弟般的援助，大大帮助了我国经济的恢复和发展，使我国的工业生产得以迅速地恢复和超过了解放前的水平，并顺利地开始了五年计划的建设工作。
    波兰经济展览会是欧洲人民民主国家在我国举行的第三个大规模的工业展览会。去年十二月开始，匈牙利人民共和国展览会曾在我国各地举行，今年四月开始，德意志民主共和国工业展览会曾在北京、上海等地举行。这些展览会都受到我国广大观众的热烈欢迎。对于我国人民了解各兄弟国家经济建设的成就，学习兄弟国家工业生产中的先进经验，发生了积极的效果。这些展览会提高了我国人民为建设我们伟大的祖国和保卫世界和平的斗争信心，获得了实际的国际主义教育，从而进一步加强了我国人民与苏联、人民民主国家人民的友好团结。
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国间的经济合作关系，是在完全平等和互利的国际主义精神的基础上，巩固地发展起来的。这种合作的基础是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的愿望。因此，这种经济合作的关系是牢不可破的。同时，由于和平民主阵营各国的经济制度排除了经济危机及资本主义经济制度其他恶果的发生的可能性，并有着丰富的人力和自然资源可以充分保证经济的发展，计划经济又使各国能够合理地利用这些资源，加速扩大生产，因此就保证了民主世界市场必然日益沿着繁荣与发展的道路前进。美帝国主义几年来一直在压迫资本主义世界各国对苏联、中国和欧洲人民民主国家实行经济“封锁”，企图从经济上围困这些国家。可是，美帝国主义者失算了，因为事实上它反而加深了资本主义世界的经济危机，并促使民主世界市场更加巩固了。
    中波两国人民间经济合作关系，是整个民主世界市场的一部分，我们两国人民在经济战线上所获得的任何成就，都意味着以苏联为首的世界民主、和平、社会主义阵营的经济力量的加强。我们希望通过波兰人民共和国经济展览会，使两国人民更加兄弟般地紧密地团结在一起，在苏联伟大的、无私的援助下，为进一步巩固地发展中波两国人民间的经济合作关系而努力。
