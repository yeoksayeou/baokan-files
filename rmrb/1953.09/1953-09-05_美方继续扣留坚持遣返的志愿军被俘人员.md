Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 4th: A special correspondent of this agency reports: The US side notified today that not a single Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war will be repatriated tomorrow. This means that the US side is not prepared to repatriate the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war whom it is forcibly detaining and who should be directly repatriated, at least not tomorrow. In the twenty-one days from August 15th to the present, the US side has not repatriated a single Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war to our side.

According to reports from our repatriated prisoners of war, there are still many Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who should be directly repatriated but have not been repatriated to our side due to secret detention by the US side. For example, on July 27th, the US side successively seized 102 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who should have been directly repatriated from Prisoner of War Camp No. 8 on Jeju Island. More than 120 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in the surgical ward of the Busan No. 1 Prisoner of War Camp and the No. 7 Prisoner of War Camp are still being detained by the US side and have not been repatriated. In addition, Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war such as Wu Chengde, Sun Zhenguan, Wang Fang, and Wei Lin, who have been imprisoned by the US side for a long time, have not yet been repatriated. Even US Secretary of the Army Stevens has publicly admitted that the US side is still detaining 250 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war.

The US side has affirmed in the Military Armistice Commission and the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee that it will repatriate all of our prisoners of war who insist on repatriation and whom it has detained. However, up to now, the US side's promise has not been put into action. People here are closely watching the US side's next move.

    美方继续扣留坚持遣返的志愿军被俘人员
    【新华社开城四日电】本社特派记者报道：美方今天通知，明天仍然没有一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员将被遣返。这就是说，美方至少在明天还不准备遣返其强迫扣留下的应该直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。从八月十五日到现在为止的二十一天内，美方没有遣送一名中国人民志愿军的被俘人员给我方。
    根据遣返归来的我方被俘人员报告，还有许多应该直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，在美方的秘密拘禁下没有遣返给我方。例如，七月二十七日，美方从济州岛第八号战俘营内先后抓走了一百零二名应该直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。在釜山第一战俘收容所外科营房和第七战俘收容所内的一百二十多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员还在美方的扣留下没有遣返。此外，如已被美方囚禁很久的中国人民志愿军被俘人员吴成德、孙振冠、王芳、魏林等也还没有遣返。就是美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯也曾公开承认，美方还扣留有二百五十名中国人民志愿军被俘人员。
    美方在军事停战委员会和战俘遣返委员会上已经肯定表示将遣返其扣留下的所有坚持遣返的我方被俘人员。但是，到现在为止，美方的诺言还未见诸行动。此间人士正密切地注视着美方的下一步行动。
