Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 29th: The Vietnamese Labor Party Central Committee's official newspaper, "People's" Weekly, published an editorial on the 26th entitled "Celebrating China's National Day," stating: "The Vietnamese people and the people of the world, with joyful and excited hearts, celebrate the National Day of the People's Republic of China together with the Chinese people."

The editorial, after recounting the Chinese people's great achievements in all fields over the past four years, said: "Today, next to the powerful Soviet Union, stands another powerful China. The world's two great nations, from Asia to Europe, have been closely linked into a whole." The editorial stated: "The victory of the Soviet Union and the victory of China are like the rising sun in the East, awakening and inspiring the people of Asia, illuminating the path for them to strive for independence and freedom, and making the people of Asia believe that imperialism is not to be feared, and the American 'paper tiger' is even less to be feared; as long as all the people unite and fight bravely, they will certainly be able to achieve liberation."

The editorial looked back on the long-standing close friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people, and the help of the Chinese revolution to the Vietnamese revolution. The editorial emphasized: "Mao Zedong Thought educates Vietnamese revolutionaries to apply Marxism-Leninism to the specific environment of Vietnam."

The editorial concluded with confidence: "Our people have learned from the experience of the Chinese people, resolutely carrying out a long-term resistance war and self-reliance. Just as the Chinese revolution has achieved complete victory, our resistance war will also be able to achieve complete victory."

Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 29th: Major newspapers and periodicals in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, starting from September 26th, have successively published articles and news celebrating our country's National Day with significant coverage.

Issue 138 of the Vietnamese Labor Party Central Committee's official newspaper, "People's" Weekly, in addition to publishing an editorial celebrating our country's National Day, also published an article by Shi Shan, acting president of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, celebrating our country's National Day. In this issue, there is also a poem by columnist C.B.: "Changing Only One Word." From the fact that "Zhennan Pass" was changed to "Munanguan," he describes the new development of the friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people.

The Vietnamese General Confederation of Labor's official newspaper, "Labor News," published an editorial in issue 224 entitled "Salute to the Chinese Working Class!" celebrating the achievements of China's construction. This issue also contained "A Letter from Vietnamese Miners to Chinese Miners," as well as an article by Vietnamese labor model Du Thi Kim Quy: "The Vietnamese Women's Delegation Visits China."

    【新华社北越二十九日电】越南劳动党中央机关报“人民”周刊在二十六日以“庆祝中国国庆节”为题发表社论说：“越南人民和全世界人民都以愉快而兴奋的心情，和中国人民一起庆祝中华人民共和国国庆节。”
    社论在历述中国人民四年来在各方面的伟大成就之后说：“今天，在强大的苏联旁边，又站立起一个强大的中国。世界上两个伟大的国家，从亚洲到欧洲已紧密地连结成一个整体。”社论说：“苏联的胜利和中国的胜利，好像是东方升起的太阳，唤醒和激励着亚洲人民，给他们照亮了争取独立和自由的道路，使亚洲人民相信：帝国主义并不可怕，而美国‘纸老虎’更不可怕；只要全体人民团结起来，勇敢地进行斗争，就一定能够获得解放。”
    社论回溯了中、越两国人民历史悠久的亲密友谊，以及中国革命的经验对越南革命的帮助，社论着重地指出：“毛泽东思想教育着越南革命者将马克思、列宁主义运用到越南的具体的环境中来。”
    社论最后满怀信心地说：“我国人民学习了中国人民的经验，坚决长期抗战、自力更生。正像中国革命已经获得了完全的胜利一样，我们的抗战也一定能够获得完全的胜利。”
