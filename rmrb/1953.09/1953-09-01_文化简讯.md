        Medical Personnel in Tianjin's Major Municipal Hospitals Systematically Study Pavlov's Theory
        Medical personnel in most municipal hospitals in Tianjin are systematically studying the advanced Soviet medical thought – Pavlov's theory.
        Starting in 1951, some medical personnel in municipal hospitals began to proactively study Pavlov's theory. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau and the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Medical Association also specially invited Soviet neurologist Alexander to Tianjin in April this year to give seven consecutive reports on the basic theory of Pavlov's theory to doctors in the city's hospitals to help everyone learn.
        Currently, most hospitals are divided into two classes, A and B, for study. Class A is composed of hospital directors, doctors, head nurses, etc., and mainly studies the reports of Soviet expert Alexander. They study for two to three hours a week, mainly through self-study, combined with discussion. Class B is composed of nurses, X-ray technicians, nutritionists, etc., and mainly listens to lectures by designated doctors in each hospital and self-studies the booklet "A Brief Explanation of Pavlov's Theory". To ensure the effectiveness of this study, each hospital has developed a study plan.

        1,400 Cadre School Students of All Ethnic Groups of the CCP Central Committee's Xinjiang Branch Graduate
        The fourth class of students of the Cadre School of the Xinjiang Branch of the CCP Central Committee graduated on August 15th. This class of graduates totals 1,412 students, including Uyghur, Han, Kazakh, Hui, Uzbek, Tatar, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Tajik, Xibe, Russian and other ethnic groups. Most of them are educators, and there are also working cadres from mass organizations such as trade unions, youth leagues, and women's federations. During their nine-month study period, they studied the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, modern Chinese history, the history of the New Democratic Revolution, as well as current events and policies. This improved their political level and their thinking on patriotism and internationalism. Therefore, during the study period, 547 people joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and 24 people joined the Communist Party of China.
        Since its establishment in March 1950, the Cadre School of the Xinjiang Branch of the CCP Central Committee has successively graduated 5,020 students. The students who graduated before have participated in Xinjiang's agricultural and animal husbandry production, land reform, and other tasks. Most of them are good cadres who can connect with the masses and serve the people of all ethnic groups.

        East China Institute of Agricultural Sciences Organizes Huaibei Wheat Comprehensive
        Work Team to Conduct Systematic Field Investigation and Research Work
        The Huaibei Wheat Comprehensive Work Team organized by the East China Institute of Agricultural Sciences recently went to the Suxian, Lingbi, and Suixi areas of Anhui to conduct field investigation and research. This is the second work team of the institute to go to rural areas this year to study the problem of wheat yield increase. The first group went to northern Anhui in April this year to comprehensively investigate and study wheat frost damage and the general production experience of the masses. After the wheat harvest, they have returned to Nanjing. This time, the Huaibei Wheat Comprehensive Work Team includes eight scientific and technical personnel in food crops, soil fertilizers, and plant protection, as well as ten agricultural technical cadres from the Anhui Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry and other agencies. The Huaibei Wheat Comprehensive Work Team has changed the isolated and fragmented working style of conducting investigation and research work in rural areas only when crops are about to mature. This time, it will conduct systematic research for a relatively long period of time, starting from the harvest of pre-wheat crops (sorghum, soybeans, etc.), through the autumn cultivation and sowing season to the summer harvest next year, and conduct comprehensive investigations and studies on soil types, natural climate, crop distribution, cultivation techniques, varieties, fertilizers, diseases and insect pests, drought and flood, etc., summarize the experience of the masses in an all-round way, and gradually find ways to increase production from the existing level of cultivation technology.

    天津大部市立医院医务人员有组织地学习巴甫洛夫学说
    天津市大部市立医院的医务人员正有组织地进行苏联先进医学思想——巴甫洛夫学说的学习。
    从一九五一年开始，有些市立医院的医务人员就主动地学习巴甫洛夫学说。天津市人民政府公共卫生局和中华医学会天津分会今年四月还特别邀请苏联神经科专家亚历山大到天津，向全市各医院的大夫连续作了七次有关巴甫洛夫学说基本理论的报告，以帮助大家学习。
    目前，大多数医院都分为甲乙两班进行学习。甲班由院长、大夫、护士长等人组成，以学习苏联专家亚历山大的报告等为主。每周学两小时到三小时，以自学为主，结合讨论。乙班由护士及爱克司光技术员、营养员等人组成，以听各医院指定大夫的讲课和自学“巴甫洛夫学说浅释”的小册子为主。为了保证这次学习的效果，各医院都订出了学习计划。

    华东农业科学研究所组织淮北小麦综合
    工作组进行系统的实地调查研究工作
    华东农业科学研究所组织淮北小麦综合工作组于最近到安徽宿县、灵璧、濉溪一带作实地调查研究。这是该所今年第二个到农村研究小麦增产问题的工作组。第一个组在今年四月到安徽北部以综合方法调查研究小麦冻害及群众一般生产经验后，已在麦收后返回南京。这次的淮北小麦综合工作组包括食用作物、土壤肥料、植物保护等方面的科学技术人员八名，并有安徽省人民政府农林厅等机关的农业技术干部十人参加工作。淮北小麦综合工作组改变过去在农作物快要成熟时才去农村进行调查研究工作的孤立、零碎的工作作风，这次将比较长期地进行系统的研究，从小麦前季作物（高粱、大豆等）的收获开始，经过秋季耕作播种时期到明年夏收，分期对土壤类型、自然气候、作物分布、栽培技术、品种、肥料、病虫害、旱涝等方面进行综合性的调查研究，全面总结群众经验，逐步从现有耕作技术水平找出增产途径。
