Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 18th: Many indications prove that the U.S. side is dispatching more Kuomintang bandit special agents to the prisoner-of-war camps under the supervision of neutral nations in order to strengthen the terroristic rule over the prisoners of war and carry out sabotage activities.

On September 17th and 18th, for two consecutive days, many Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission by the U.S. side did not have name and prisoner-of-war number cards. The special agents mixed among the prisoners of war also coerced the prisoners of war not to tell their names and numbers to the Indian custodial forces. At the same time, the U.S. side even refused to provide the Indian custodial forces with a list of prisoners of war. This situation is clearly a premeditated scheme colluded by the U.S. side and the Kuomintang special agents, the purpose of which is to make it impossible for the Indian forces to verify the identity of the prisoners of war, so that more Kuomintang special agents can sneak into the camps among the prisoners of war.

It is particularly noteworthy that among the 1,946 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission by the U.S. side on September 17th, a group of about 1,000 people were all wearing large dark glasses. The U.S. side's giving so many prisoners of war dark glasses was probably to cover up certain important Kuomintang special agents mixed into the camps, so that they would not be recognized.

At the same time that the U.S. side is stepping up the dispatch of more special agents to the prisoner-of-war camps, the special agents are also acting more arrogantly under the instructions of the U.S. side. The prisoners of war who arrived on the morning of the 17th were all carrying stones. After arriving at the prisoner-of-war verification point, the special agents issued orders, coercing the prisoners of war to throw stones at the Korean-Chinese observation representatives and shout loudly. The reporter saw one tall and one short person directing several groups of prisoners of war to throw stones. Neutral Nations observers and Indian soldiers were also hit by stones in this pre-planned disturbance. At this time, the special agents inside the camp also shouted to the newly arrived prisoners of war with loudspeakers, coercing the prisoners of war in the camp to line up and shout reactionary slogans.

Many prisoners of war handed over to the Indian forces on the 18th were forced to hold Kuomintang flags made of paper, which were obviously uniformly distributed. In many squads, one person at the front and one at the back ordered the prisoners of war to shout reactionary slogans, and some even held pre-prepared strips of paper with slogans written on them, reading them one by one. However, the prisoners of war were unwilling to shout these slogans, their voices were sparse, and together they were even smaller than the voice of the person leading the shouting.

Those special agents who have already infiltrated the prisoner-of-war camps under the supervision of neutral nations are wantonly disrupting the order of the camps. The reporter saw on the 18th that several special agents climbed onto the roofs of the houses in the camp and shouted loudly at the newly arrived prisoners of war with loudspeakers. When the vehicles of the Korean-Chinese observation representatives passed outside the prisoner-of-war camps, the special agents forced the prisoners of war to throw stones. Some prisoners of war were forced to do so, but most of the prisoners of war did not throw stones, but took the opportunity to approach the barbed wire fence and looked closely at the Korean-Chinese observation representatives from there.

### 美方派遣大批特务  混入中立国看管的战俘营场

    美方派遣大批特务
    混入中立国看管的战俘营场
    【新华社开城十八日电】许多迹象证明：美方正在派遣更多的国民党匪帮特务到中立国看管战俘的营场里去，以便加强对战俘的恐怖统治，并进行破坏活动。
    十七日和十八日接连两天，由美方移交给中立国遣返委员会的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，有许多人没有姓名和战俘编号的卡片。混在战俘中间的特务分子并且胁迫战俘不把他们的名字和编号告诉印度看管部队。同时，美方竟拒绝向印度看管部队提出战俘名单。这种情形显然是美方和国民党特务串通起来的一项预谋，其目的在于使印度部队无法验明战俘的身分，以便更多的国民党特务得以混在战俘中间潜入营场。
    特别值得注意的是：在十七日美方交给中立国遣返委员会的一千九百四十六名中国人民志愿军被俘人员中，有一批大约一千人，竟全都戴着大黑眼镜。美方给这么多战俘戴上黑眼镜大概是为了掩护某些重要的国民党特务混入营场，使他们不致被人认出。
    与美方加紧派遣更多特务混到战俘营里来同时，特务们在美方的指使下活动得也更加嚣张了。十七日上午到达的战俘身上都装着石块，到战俘点验地后特务分子就发出号令，胁迫战俘们向朝中观察代表投掷石块，并高声喊打。记者曾看到一高一矮两个人指挥了好几批战俘投掷石块。中立国观察人员以及印度士兵也在这种预先策划好的捣乱中被石块打中。这时，在营场里面的特务分子也用喇叭筒向刚到达的战俘喊叫，胁迫营内战俘排着队喊反动口号。
    十八日移交给印度部队的许多战俘，都被强迫拿着显然是统一发给的纸做的国民党的旗帜。许多小队中，在队前队尾各有一人命令战俘们喊反动口号，有的还拿着事先准备好的写着口号的纸条一条一条地念。但是，战俘们却不情愿喊这些口号，他们的声音稀稀落落，合起来比领头喊的一个人的声音还要小。
    那些已经混进中立国看管营场的特务们正在肆无忌惮地破坏着营场的秩序。记者在十八日看到，有几个特务爬上了营场内的房顶，用喇叭筒向刚刚到达的战俘们大声叫喊，当朝中观察代表们的车辆从战俘营场外边经过时，特务们又强使战俘们投掷石头。有些战俘被迫这样做了，但是大多数的战俘却并不投石头，只是利用这个机会靠近铁丝网，从那里细看朝中观察代表。
