    Nearly Ten Thousand Urban and Rural Grassroots Units Nationwide Have Completed Universal Suffrage Elections
    The people's congress system implemented through universal suffrage in the first year of our country's Five-Year Plan for construction has achieved tremendous success. According to recent incomplete statistics, the grassroots election work, which began on a trial basis in May this year and has been carried out in batches, has been successfully completed in nearly ten thousand townships, towns, urban districts, and municipalities not divided into districts across the country. In these areas where universal suffrage has been completed, the people's democratic dictatorship system has become more complete and consolidated, and it has demonstrated its powerful promotion of the country's economic construction.
    The Southwest region, which has made faster progress in universal suffrage, has concluded elections in 4,560 townships, towns, and 28 urban districts. As of September 15th, the Northeast region had completed elections in 3,306 administrative villages (equivalent to townships), one town, and six urban districts. Among them, more than two-thirds had convened people's congresses and established grassroots political power organizations. In the Central South region, a month ago, 920 townships and towns with a population of approximately two million had convened people's congresses and established township and town people's governments. In the East China region, more than 800 townships, 47 small towns, one city (Fuzhou), 17 urban districts, and 50 urban electoral districts have successively elected people's representatives. According to incomplete statistics, the Northwest region currently has a total of 87 townships, three urban districts, and one Mongolian autonomous region that have concluded universal suffrage elections. In the North China region, the universal suffrage movement started relatively late. In addition to Tianjin completing the first stage of population surveys and voter registration in various urban districts and two suburban townships, Beijing has completed the trial implementation of universal suffrage in one urban electoral district and two suburban townships. The remaining three provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, and Suiyuan, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also have some grassroots units that have completed the trial implementation of universal suffrage.
    In areas that have undergone universal suffrage, people's congresses and political power organizations at the grassroots level include representatives from all ethnic groups and all social strata who are commensurate with their status. In cities, the newly elected people's congresses include people from all walks of life with the working class as the main component. Among the 84 representatives elected in the Open-pit District of Fushun City, 49 are workers. Among the 196 representatives in the West District of Chengdu City, there are 67 model workers. The people's representatives elected in Yanziji Town, Nanjing City, include 33 people from various professions and strata such as workers, farmers, boat people, government cadres, enterprise employees, other working people, and industrialists and businessmen. In ethnic autonomous regions and areas where ethnic groups live together or are mixed, people of all ethnic groups have their own representatives elected. In the five townships of the Shangwuzhuang Hui Autonomous Region in Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province, where universal suffrage was trialed, people of all ethnic groups, including Hui, Han, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Tu, elected representatives commensurate with their ethnic population and appropriately took care of ethnic groups with small populations. For example, the Tibetan population in Hergai Township only accounts for 9.9% of the total population of the township, but the elected representatives account for 13.5% of the total number of representatives. In Dangui Township, Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, where Miao and Han ethnic groups live together, the Miao people, who account for 15% of the township's population, have nine representatives out of the 35 representatives in the township, five of whom were nominated by Han voters. In the people's congresses in urban and rural areas, representatives of youth and women also account for a certain proportion. Because the people's congresses elected through universal suffrage have a broader representation, the unity among people of all ethnic groups and all strata has been greatly strengthened.
    The people's representatives elected in various places are outstanding figures among the people of all ethnic groups and all sectors. Communist Party members and members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League are first and foremost fully trusted by the people. According to statistics from 470 townships (towns) in 34 counties including Nanchong and Suining in Sichuan Province, Communist Party members and Youth League members account for 37% of the elected people's representatives. In the old revolutionary base areas, many people's representatives (the vast majority of whom are Communist Party members) who have undergone years of revolutionary struggle and inherited the glorious democratic tradition are warmly loved by the voters. Among the 75 representatives elected in the trial electoral districts of Yan'an County, 17 are people's representatives who have been re-elected for more than ten years in successive elections since the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. In the hometown of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De—Ma'an Township, Yilong County, Sichuan Province—ten old cadres and Red Army family members who personally experienced the Second Domestic Revolutionary War were elected as representatives. Among these outstanding figures, there are also many model workers in industry and agriculture. In the Open-pit District of Fushun City, 20 labor models were elected as people's representatives, including Zhang Zifu and Zheng Huaishan, nationally renowned coal mine labor models. All 32 production, water conservancy, and work models from eight townships in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, were gloriously elected. In addition, in many areas, the elected people's representatives also include model revolutionary martyrs, family members of military personnel, and military personnel in their hometowns.
    In areas that have completed universal suffrage elections, the original cadres in all urban and rural grassroots political power organizations have generally undergone a mass appraisal and education. This is a major gain in this grassroots election. Many cadres have been loved and praised by the masses for their firm stand, democratic work style, and active and responsible work attitude, and have been re-elected as people's representatives. A considerable number of cadres, although they have achieved results in their work, still have problems with their work style. After the masses affirmed their achievements and criticized their shortcomings, they humbly reviewed their actions and expressed their determination to correct them, thereby regaining the understanding and trust of the people and being elected. In addition, some bad elements and law-breaking and discipline-violating elements in the grassroots political power, as well as some people who were extremely dissatisfied by the masses, were removed in this election. Grassroots cadres who have undergone universal suffrage education have greatly improved their leadership style and working methods, and their ties with the people have become closer. Last year, the cadres of the Gongnong Township in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, used coercive orders to "mobilize" the masses to fight drought, and only irrigated a few mu of dry land in more than a month. This year, they followed the opinions of the masses and mobilized very few people and waterwheels, irrigating more than 400 mu of dry land in ten days. Wang Piyi, the township chief of Lijiaqu Township, Yan'an County, did not go deep into his work in the past, and the masses said that his "legs are models, but his brain is lazy." After the universal suffrage election, the masses said that his "legs and brain are both models." Because the grassroots political power organizations were rectified and simplified through universal suffrage, many cadres who used to suffer from multiple concurrent positions and frequent meetings were able to free up more time to participate in production and lead production, which the masses generally felt satisfied with.
    Through the universal suffrage movement, the newly elected people's representatives and the broad masses of the people have further promoted the spirit of being masters of the country and fully exercised their rights to manage and supervise national affairs and government cadres. In the month when the Ninth District of Licheng County, Shandong Province, conducted a trial implementation of universal suffrage, it received 1,329 letters from the people regarding criticisms, denunciations, suggestions, and requests, of which 575 were criticisms of cadres. Before the convening of the town people's congress in Yanziji Town, Nanjing City, the 33 elected people's representatives collected more than 190 proposals and opinions from the masses related to production, water conservancy, culture and education, health, and criticism of cadres' work styles, and promptly and proactively resolved the problems in the masses' proposals that could be resolved at any time. Judging from the proposals received by the people's congresses in various places, the opinions and demands of the people have been fully reflected through their representatives. Nearly 90 proposals were brought to the congress by the people's representatives of Changshan Township, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, after they had been sorted out. This had never happened before. After the universal suffrage elections, farmers in Ma'an Township, Yilong County, Sichuan Province, made 55 suggestions and criticisms to the government, 40 of which were constructive opinions that were beneficial to production.
    The people's democratic system, which has become more complete and consolidated due to the implementation of universal suffrage, has powerfully promoted the progress of production and construction. The first people's congresses convened in various places after the universal suffrage elections all focused on discussing the production issues that the local people were most concerned about. At the same time, because the broad masses of the people have experienced a new upsurge in political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm in the universal suffrage movement, a vibrant atmosphere of working people striving for production can be seen in all areas where universal suffrage has been completed. In cities, the broad masses of workers are implementing the enthusiasm of universal suffrage into practical actions to strive to complete and overfulfill the state production plan. After Zheng Huaishan, a coal mine labor model from the Open-pit Mine of Fushun City, was elected as a district people's representative, his production team increased its daily coal loading from ten cars to thirteen cars. The woodworking and water supply workers of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory were extremely excited after receiving their voter registration cards, and their work efficiency increased three times compared to before. In rural areas, with the end of universal suffrage, the enthusiasm of farmers to strive for a bumper harvest has become even higher. The farmers of Guanyi Township, Feixi County, Anhui Province, and Changshan Township, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, have both been swept up in a production upsurge to strive for and ensure a bumper harvest after the universal suffrage elections. After holding the village people's congress in Laoyemiao Village, Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, production competitions to implement the resolutions were launched between groups, households, and individuals, and remarkable achievements were made in transplanting seedlings and topdressing fertilizer. The autumn field weeding in the trial universal suffrage townships of Yan'an County was completed three days earlier than the time stipulated in the resolutions of the congress, and the preparations for expanding wheat fields and sowing winter wheat were also about ten days earlier than in previous years.

    全国已有近万个城乡基层单位完成普选
    在我国开始五年建设计划的第一年中所实行的普选的人民代表大会制度，已获得巨大成绩。据最近不完全统计，从今年五月开始试办和分批开展的基层选举工作，已在全国范围内将近一万个乡、镇、市辖区和不辖区的市等基层单位中胜利完成。在这些完成普选的地区，人民民主专政制度已更加完备和巩固，并且已显示出它对于国家经济建设事业的有力的推动作用。
    普选进展较快的西南区已在四千五百六十个乡、镇和二十八个市辖区结束普选。东北区截至九月十五日止，已有三千三百零六个行政村（相等于乡）、一个镇和六个市辖区完成选举，其中约有三分之二以上召开了人民代表大会，成立了基层政权组织。中南区在一个月以前，就已有九百二十个乡、镇共约二百万人口的地区召开了人民代表大会，成立了乡、镇人民政府。华东区已有八百多个乡、四十七个小城镇、一个市（福州）、十七个市辖区和五十个市内选区先后选出了人民代表。西北区据不完全统计，目前共有八十七个乡、三个市辖区和一个蒙族自治区结束普选。在华北区，普选运动开始较迟。除天津市在市内各区和市郊两个乡完成了普选第一阶段的人口调查和选民登记外，北京市已结束了市内一个选区和市郊两个乡的普选试办工作，其余河北、山西、绥远三省和内蒙古自治区也有一部分基层单位结束了普选试办工作。
    经过普选的地区，在基层单位的人民代表大会和政权组织中，各民族各阶层都有与其地位相当的代表。在城市中，新选的人民代表大会包括了以工人阶级为主要成分的各阶层人民。抚顺市露天区选出的八十四名代表中，有四十九名是工人。成都市西城区的一百九十六名代表中，有六十七个模范工人。南京市燕子矶镇当选的人民代表包括了工人、农民、船民、机关干部、企业职员、其他劳动人民以及工商业者等三十三名各种不同职业和阶层的人物。在民族自治区以及民族聚居和杂居的地区，各族人民都有他们自己的代表当选。青海省湟中县上五庄回族自治区试办普选的五个乡，回、汉、蒙、藏、土等各族人民都选出了与其本族人口相当的代表，并适当地照顾了人口特少的民族。例如合尔盖乡藏族人口只占全乡人口的百分之九点九，但选出的代表占全体代表的百分之十三点五。苗、汉族杂居的四川省叙永县丹桂乡，占全乡人口百分之十五的苗族人民，在全乡三十五名代表中就有九名代表，其中有五名是由汉族选民提出的。在各地城乡人民代表大会中，青年和妇女的代表也都占有一定的比重。由于普选的人民代表大会具有更加广泛的代表性，因此各民族、各阶层人民内部的团结已大大加强。
    各地当选的人民代表都是各族各界人民中的优秀人物。中国共产党党员和中国新民主主义青年团团员在选举中首先受到人民群众充分的信任。据四川省南充、遂宁等三十四个县的四百七十个乡（镇）的统计，当选的人民代表中，共产党员和青年团员占百分之三十七。在革命老根据地，许多经受过多年革命斗争考验并继承了光荣的民主传统的人民代表（绝大部分是共产党员），得到选民们热烈的爱戴。延安县各试办选区选出的七十五名代表中，有十七人是第二次国内革命战争以来历次选举中连选连任十年以上的人民代表。在朱总司令故乡——四川省仪陇县马鞍乡，有十名亲身经历过第二次国内革命战争的老干部和红军家属当选为代表。在这些优秀人物中，还有许多工农业劳动模范。抚顺市露天区有二十名劳动模范当选为人民代表，其中包括全国著名的煤矿劳动模范张子富和郑怀山等人。四川省温江县八个乡的三十二名生产、水利和工作模范，全部光荣当选。此外，在不少地区，当选的人民代表中还包括模范的革命烈士、军人家属和在乡军人。
    在完成普选的地区，所有城乡基层政权组织中的原有干部，普遍经过了一次群众性的鉴别和教育。这是这次基层选举中一个重大的收获。有不少干部由于具有坚定的立场、民主的作风和积极负责的工作态度而受到群众的热爱和赞扬，再次当选为人民代表；也有相当数量的工作虽有成绩但作风仍有毛病的干部，在经过群众肯定成绩和批评缺点之后，虚心进行检讨，表示了改正决心，因而重新取得人民的谅解和信任而当选；另外，还有一部分基层政权中的坏分子、违法乱纪分子以及若干为群众所极不满意的分子，则在这次选举中被剔除出去。凡是经过普选教育的基层干部，领导作风和工作方法都有很大改进，和人民群众的联系也更加密切。四川省内江县工农乡干部去年用强迫命令的办法“动员”群众抗旱，一个多月只灌了几亩旱田；今年根据群众意见办事，动员了很少的人力和水车，十天内就灌了四百多亩旱田。延安县李家渠乡乡长王丕义过去工作不深入，群众说他“腿是模范，脑是懒汉”；普选以后，群众却说他“腿脑都是模范”了。由于经过普选整顿和简化了基层政权组织，使许多过去苦于兼职多、会议多的干部，能够抽出更多时间参加生产领导生产，群众普遍感到满意。
    经过普选运动，新选出的人民代表和广大人民群众更加发扬了国家主人翁的精神，充分运用自己的权利去管理和监督国家事务和政府干部。山东省历城县第九区在试办普选的一个月中，收到一千三百二十九件有关批评、检举、建议和要求等事项的人民来信，其中有五百七十五件是对干部的批评。南京市燕子矶镇所选出的三十三名人民代表在镇人民代表大会召开前，从群众中收集了有关生产、水利、文教、卫生及批评干部作风的提案和意见一百九十多件，并及时主动地解决了群众提案中可以随时解决的问题。从各地人民代表大会所收到的提案来看，人民群众的意见和要求已通过自己的代表充分地反映出来。浙江省富阳县长山乡经过人民代表整理后带到代表大会上去的提案将近九十件，这是过去从来没有过的事。四川省仪陇县马鞍乡农民在普选后曾向政府提出了五十五件建议和批评，其中有四十件是有益于生产的建设性的意见。
    由于实行普选而更加完备和巩固的人民民主制度，已有力地推动了生产建设事业的进行。各地普选后首次召开的人民代表大会，都着重讨论了当地人民最关心的生产问题；同时，由于广大人民群众在普选运动中，政治积极性与劳动热情有了新的高涨，因此，在所有完成普选的地区，都可以看到劳动人民努力生产的蓬勃气象。在城市中，广大工人群众正在把普选的热情贯彻到争取完成和超额完成国家生产计划的实际行动中去。抚顺市露天矿煤矿劳动模范郑怀山当选为区人民代表后，他的生产小组每天装煤已由十车提高到十三车。太原市重型机器厂锯木供水工人领到选民证后异常兴奋，工作效率较前提高三倍。在农村中，随着普选的结束，农民们为争取丰收而斗争的热情更加高涨。安徽省肥西县馆驿乡和浙江省富阳县长山乡的农民，在普选后都卷入了争取丰收、确保丰收的生产热潮。辽东省凤城县老爷庙村在举行村人民代表大会后，组与组、户与户、个人与个人之间展开了贯彻决议的生产竞赛，在插秧、追肥等工作中都创造了显著的成绩。延安县各普选试办乡的秋田锄草比代表大会决议中规定的时间提前三天完成，扩大麦田和播种冬麦的准备工作，也比往年提前十天左右。
