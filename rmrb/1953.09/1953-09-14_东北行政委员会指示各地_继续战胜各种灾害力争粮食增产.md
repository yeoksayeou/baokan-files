Since late July, continuous rainfall has occurred in Northeast China, causing some rivers to overflow and create disasters. Furthermore, the threat of insect pests has not been completely eliminated. In addition, due to rushed weeding, some farmlands have become overgrown with weeds, and some crops exhibit excessive vegetative growth due to excessive rain, low temperatures, and insufficient sunshine, all of which will affect this year's autumn harvest.

In order to protect the autumn harvest and strive for increased autumn grain production, the Northeast Administrative Committee recently issued instructions requiring all localities to mobilize and organize the broad masses to continue fighting against various disasters. The instructions pointed out that since the beginning of summer, continuous rain has left the soil moisture in many areas close to saturation. Recently, there have been more frequent storms and torrential rains, making it easier for rivers to overflow and cause waterlogging. Therefore, all localities must fully utilize existing experience based on local conditions and organize the masses to do a good job in flood and waterlogging prevention. The downstream areas of the Songhua River should focus on flood control. In areas with tense flood situations, other work should be arranged while ensuring flood control. Areas affected by floods must educate the masses to overcome any feelings of unease, explain the policy of tax reduction and exemption to the masses, enhance their confidence in production and disaster relief, and actively adopt effective measures such as digging ditches for drainage, supporting seedlings, and washing seedlings to rescue crops based on specific conditions, combined with disaster relief work, in order to reduce disaster losses and ensure a possible harvest. Wheat fields in northern Manchuria that have not yet been harvested must be rushed to thresh and stubble.

The instructions stated that the second generation of cutworms is still developing significantly in the southern regions, while the cutworm infestation has subsided in the northern regions, but corn borers are occurring in many areas. In addition, sorghum and soybean aphids and cotton bollworms are also developing considerably. Therefore, all localities must overcome the complacency that has begun to grow in some cadres and among the masses, continue to conduct thorough field inspections, grasp the pest situation in a timely manner, fully mobilize the masses, consult with them, and promote effective prevention and control methods on the spot (such as using insect nets, etc.). Educate farmers with vivid examples at any time and any place to break conservative thinking, inspire the masses to prevent insects, and do a good job in insect prevention and control.

It is necessary to do a good job in removing large weeds and leaving autumn stubble based on the needs of different crops in different regions and labor conditions. This can not only inhibit excessive vegetative growth, promote early maturity, improve the quality of grain and cotton, and avoid labor-intensive harvesting, but also prevent land abandonment next year. This is an effective method that ordinary farmers are accustomed to doing and can easily do, and we should actively lead farmers to implement it. The phenomenon in some areas of thinking that the masses understand and letting them go without actively providing specific guidance must be quickly corrected.

In addition to requiring all localities to do the above work to ensure the autumn harvest, the instructions also require making preparations for the autumn harvest. Local leading organs should arrange various tasks appropriately based on local conditions and starting from reality, and seize the leadership of mutual assistance and cooperation to tap production potential and improve labor efficiency.

    东北行政委员会指示各地
    继续战胜各种灾害力争粮食增产
    东北各地自七月下旬以来即不断降雨，部分河流先后漫溢成灾，并且虫害威胁仍未完全解除，再加上由于突击铲趟，有些农田草多地荒，若干作物因雨水多、温度低、日照少，呈现贪青现象，均将影响今年秋田收成。
    东北行政委员会为了保护秋收，力争秋田增产，最近特发出指示，要求各地动员与组织广大群众，继续向各种灾害作斗争。指示中指出：入夏以来霪雨连绵，许多地区土壤水分已接近饱和，而近来暴风骤雨较多，河水外溢和积水内涝现象均易发生。因此各地必须根据当地具体情况，充分运用已有经验，组织群众做好防洪、防涝工作。松花江下游地区应以防汛为主，在汛情紧张地区，更应在做好防汛的前提下安排其他工作。已受水灾地区，必须教育群众，克服某些群众某些不安情绪，向群众讲清负担减免政策，提高群众生产救灾的信心，并根据具体情况，结合救灾工作，积极采取挖沟排水、扶苗、洗苗等有效办法，抢救庄稼，以减轻灾害损失，保证可能的收成。北满部分未拉回麦子的麦田，要突击拉打和搅麦槎工作。
    指示中说：目前南部地区第二代夜盗虫仍有相当发展，北部地区夜盗虫虽已减退，但谷子钻心虫又在许多地区发生；此外高粱、大豆蚜虫和棉花红铨虫等亦有相当发展。因之各地必须克服在某些干部与群众中已经开始滋长的麻痹思想，继续深入田间检查，及时掌握虫情；充分发动群众，和群众商量，就地推广有效的防治办法（如使用捕虫兜、捕虫网等）；随时随地用生动实例教育农民打破保守思想，鼓舞群众防虫情绪，做好防虫治虫工作。
    要切实根据不同地区不同作物的需要与劳力条件，做好拿大草、放秋垅等工作。这样一方面可以抑制贪青、促进早熟、提高粮食和棉花的质量、避免收割时费工，另一方面也可防止明年地荒。这是一般农民习惯做而且比较容易做到的有效办法，应该积极领导农民实行。某些地区认为群众懂得，而放任自流，不积极加以具体领导的现象，必须迅速纠正。
    指示中除要求各地做好上述工作，保证秋田收成之外，还要求做好秋收准备工作。各地领导机关应根据当地具体情况，从实际出发，适当安排各项工作，并抓紧互助合作的领导，以挖掘生产潜力，提高劳动效率。
