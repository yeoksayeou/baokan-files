Following the Second National Judicial Conference, most judicial organs above the provincial and municipal levels have convened judicial conferences in their respective regions to convey and discuss the resolutions of the National Judicial Conference. In accordance with the spirit of this conference, they have reviewed past work, affirmed achievements, criticized shortcomings and errors, and formulated plans for implementing the resolutions based on local conditions, unified the thinking of cadres, and enhanced their confidence in their work. At present, in addition to the three main tasks that people's courts at all levels must focus on – handling cases of wrongful arrest, detention, and judgment, clearing backlog cases, and establishing people's tribunals in the general election – they should also systematically carry out the following tasks in conjunction with these efforts:

A. Strengthening judicial administration and establishing and improving the judicial administration organizations of people's courts above the provincial and municipal levels, and cultivating and training cadres, especially supplementing the grassroots courts and equipping specialized tribunals with judges, are important tasks in the basic construction of judicial work at present, and a decisive key to ensuring the implementation of the resolutions of the Second National Judicial Conference organizationally.

First, in order to successfully complete the task of supplementing judicial cadres, people's courts at all levels must consult with personnel departments to make overall plans based on the staffing quotas stipulated by the State Council of the Central People's Government, taking provinces and cities as units, and formulate plans for supplementing cadres. These plans should be submitted to the local leading organs for approval, and the required number of cadres should be replenished in batches and in stages before June 1954. At the same time, because the vacancies in people's courts at all levels are currently very large, the backbone is very weak, and there are many backlog cases, the external transfer of leading judicial personnel should be stopped as soon as possible. If these tasks are not grasped tightly, the organizational construction will fail and affect the overall work.

Second, when supplementing cadres to people's courts at all levels, the standard must be that the cadres are "capable in both character and ability." The judges to be transferred must be politically pure and have a certain amount of work experience and education, and be competent after short-term training. Specifically, those transferred to be judges in counties (cities), including the original judges, must have two or three cadres of the quality of the head or deputy head of a county (city) people's government section to serve as heads of the trial groups. Other judges must have the quality equivalent to that of a first-class staff member. Those transferred to be heads or deputy heads of trial divisions in provincial (municipal) courts must have the quality equivalent to that of the head or deputy head of a provincial (municipal) government department, and their judges must have the quality equivalent to that of the head or deputy head of a provincial (municipal) people's government section. Otherwise, it will be difficult for them to competently undertake the complex trial tasks. Strict prevention should be taken against the phenomenon of filling positions with unqualified personnel or even allowing bad elements to take the opportunity to infiltrate when increasing personnel. As for the political and material treatment of cadres, it should also be reasonably determined based on the character and ability of each cadre.

Third, one of the important methods to improve the quality of cadres is to strengthen the training of cadres. This year and next spring, judicial authorities above the provincial and municipal levels, under the unified leadership and deployment of the local leading organs, together with the existing and newly transferred cadres, each major administrative region should train 200 to 500 people, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the 32 provinces and cities should train 6,620 people in two phases (this number is compiled based on the plans submitted by various regions). This is an arduous task that should be achieved by overcoming all difficulties, and the erroneous thinking of "only using cadres without educating them" must be combatted. Judicial administrative departments at all levels should effectively help training classes summarize and exchange teaching experiences to improve the effectiveness of training cadres.

Fourth, new cadres should be given necessary professional education and assigned to appropriate jobs based on their character and ability conditions, so as to give full play to their work efficiency.

Fifth, some outstanding judicial workers have now been trained in people's courts at all levels. In this supplementary and adjustment of cadres, they should be boldly promoted according to the standard of "capable in both character and ability." When promoting cadres, consideration should be given to the seniority of the cadres, but seniority should not be the main standard. It is necessary to oppose the tendency to only pay attention to asking the leading organs to supplement cadres, but not to cultivate and promote cadres from the original judicial workers, as well as the view that cadres are required to be perfect in every way.

Sixth, from the Central Ministry of Justice to the grassroots courts, cadres must be systematically understood from work, in order to gradually become familiar with cadres and use them correctly. The leadership of professional learning for on-the-job cadres must be planned on a regular basis. Every judicial cadre must, in addition to general theoretical learning, spend four hours a week during working hours to specialize in professional learning. In the process of learning, the ideological dynamics of cadres should be grasped at any time, and problems should be discovered and guided in a timely manner.

B. Organizational construction and system construction are important links in strengthening judicial work, and discovering and mastering typical experiences through typical experiments to promote the overall situation is an important leadership method. The judicial organs of major regions and some provinces and cities should, according to needs and possibilities, conduct typical experiments on specialized courts for industry and mining, railways, and water transportation in a planned manner (a total of 22 nationwide). After selecting the objects and formulating plans, all localities are requested to report the candidates for court presidents to the Central Ministry of Justice for the record. People's courts above the provincial and municipal levels must directly grasp the work of at least one or two grassroots courts or specialized courts in order to obtain typical experience. The Central Ministry of Justice will also cooperate with the Supreme People's Court to send a group of cadres to participate in the typical experiments of specialized courts and grassroots courts. The specific task of the typical experiment is to take trial work as the center, summarize trial work experience, improve and improve the trial system, and gradually obtain experience in specialized courts, circuit courts, people's reception rooms, mediation committees, comrade trial meetings, and the jury system from typical experiments, in order to establish advanced role models. At the same time, through these organizational forms, connect with the masses, carry forward the trial work methods of following the mass line, and consolidate them organizationally.

C. Strengthening inspection work and deeply understanding the situation are one of the best ways to overcome bureaucracy. In order to help lower-level courts implement the resolutions of the Second National Judicial Conference, the Central Judicial Department will organize several inspection groups under the unified leadership of the Political and Legal Committee of the State Council to focus on inspecting the work of people's courts in several provinces, cities, and counties. People's courts in major regions, provinces, and cities should also send inspection groups to inspect work. The content of this inspection should focus on: the situation of conveying and studying the resolutions of this judicial conference; the situation of checking and correcting cases of wrongful arrest, detention, and judgment and clearing backlog cases; the plan and progress of typical experiments on people's tribunals in the general election; the plan and progress of cadre allocation, supplementation and training; the situation of typical experiments on specialized courts for industry and mining, railways, and water transportation, comrade trial meetings, and grassroots courts. Each inspection group should, according to the progress of the work, inspect and study one or two or two or three main issues each time, so as to truly understand the problems. The inspection group must be led by cadres with the ability to grasp policies, observe and analyze. Before the inspection group goes down, the tasks and methods should be explained in detail, and the inspection group should accept the guidance of the local Party and government leading organs. In the inspection, a realistic attitude should be adopted, and the situation should be understood from many aspects and the problems should be analyzed comprehensively. Not only should the extent of the plan and work be inspected, but especially the implementation of the policy should be inspected, as well as whether the original instructions and plans themselves have shortcomings and should be modified. It is necessary to actively guide and help the units being inspected to solve problems and correct shortcomings, and not just passively criticize. Judicial organs at all levels must use this as a criterion for inspection work, and improve leadership and close ties between superiors and subordinates through inspection work.

D. All judicial cadres must conscientiously study the resolutions of the Second National Judicial Conference, Minister Shi Liang's "Report on Strengthening the Construction of People's Judicial Work" and the People's Daily editorial on May 14 "Strengthening People's Judicial Work During the Period of National Construction" and other three documents. In the study, the main responsible comrades of the judicial organs at all levels should first convey the resolutions and spirit of this conference and clarify them in light of the specific conditions of the local area, and enlighten the cadres who study the documents ideologically. The above documents should be studied continuously for a total of 24 hours, with two hours of work time allocated each day, in order to improve cadres' ideological understanding and work confidence through this study, ensure the correct implementation of the resolutions, and lay the foundation for establishing a regular professional learning system in the future.

    中央人民政府司法部
    关于执行第二届全国司法会议决议的指示
    （一九五三年八月三十一日）
    第二届全国司法会议以后，省市以上司法机关，多数已召开了本地区的司法会议，传达和讨论了全国司法会议决议，根据这次会议的精神，检查了过去的工作，肯定成绩，批评缺点和错误，并根据当地具体情况制定了执行决议的计划，统一了干部的思想和提高了干部的工作信心。目前各级人民法院除必须抓紧处理错捕、错押、错判案件，清理积案和建立普选中人民法庭等三项主要工作外，并应结合这些工作有计划地做好下列各项工作。
    甲、加强司法行政工作，建立与健全省市以上人民法院的司法行政组织，培养和训练干部，特别是补充基层法院和配备专门法庭的审判人员，是目前司法工作基本建设中的一项重要任务，也是从组织上保证第二届全国司法会议决议贯彻执行的一个决定关键。
    第一、为顺利完成补充司法干部的任务，各级人民法院必须商同人事部门按照中央人民政府政务院规定的编制名额以省、市为单位通盘筹划，作出补充干部计划，报请当地领导机关批准，于一九五四年六月以前分批、分期按应增加的数目补齐；同时，因为目前各级人民法院缺额甚大，骨干甚弱，而积案又多，应尽速停止司法领导骨干的外调。这些工作如抓得不紧，将使组织建设落空，并影响整个工作。
    第二、补充各级人民法院干部时，必须以干部的“德才能够胜任”为标准，所调审判人员必须是政治纯洁，并有一定工作经验与文化程度，经过短期训练即可称职的干部。其具体条件，凡调任县
    （市）审判员者，连同原有审判员在内，必须有两三个相当于县（市）人民政府正副科长质量的干部，以充任审判组组长，其他审判员必须具有相当于一等科员的质量；调任省（市）院正副审判庭长者，必须相当于省（市）府正副处长的质量，其审判员必须相当于省（市）人民政府正副科长的质量，否则很难胜任地负担起复杂的审判任务。应严格防止增调人员时可能发生的滥竽充数甚至使坏分子乘机混入的现象发生。至于干部的政治和物质待遇，亦应以各个干部的德才为根据，合理地确定之。
    第三、提高干部质量的重要方法之一，是加强对于干部的训练工作，在今年和明春内，省市以上各级司法主管部门，在当地领导机关的统一领导和部署下连同现有及新调干部，各大行政区应各训练二百至五百名，内蒙古自治区及各省市共三十二个单位，应分两期训练六千六百二十名（此数目系根据各地所提计划编成）。这是一个艰巨的工作，应克服一切困难来实现，并且必须和对干部“只使用不教育”的错误思想进行斗争。各级司法行政部门应切实帮助训练班总结和交流教学经验，提高训练干部的工作实效。
    第四、对于新增加的干部，应给予必要的业务教育，并根据其德才条件，分配到适当的工作岗位，以便充分发挥其工作效能。
    第五、在各级人民法院中，现在都已锻炼出一些优秀的司法工作人员，在此次补充和调整干部中，应根据“德才能够胜任”为标准，大胆加以提拔，当提拔干部时应照顾到干部的资望，但不应以资望为主要标准。必须反对只注意要求领导机关补充干部，而不注意从原有司法工作人员中培植提拔干部的偏向，以及对干部要求十全十美的观点。
    第六、自中央司法部起，至基层法院止，必须从工作中系统地对干部加以了解，以便从工作中逐步熟悉干部并正确使用干部。对于在职干部的业务学习领导，必须按期订出计划，每个司法工作干部，除一般的理论学习外，每周必须在工作时间内抽出四小时专门学习业务。在学习中应随时掌握干部思想动态，及时发现问题，予以指导。
    乙、组织建设和制度建设，是加强司法工作的重要环节，而通过典型试验，发现和掌握典型经验以推动全局，则是一项重要的领导方法。各大区及某些省、市司法机关，应根据需要和可能，有计划地进行工矿、铁路、水运专门法庭的典型试验（全国共计二十二个），各地于选好对象拟定计划后，望连同庭长人选报请中央司法部备案。各省市以上人民法院，至少必须直接掌握一两个基层法院或专门法庭的工作，以便取得典型经验。中央司法部亦将协同最高人民法院派出一批干部参加专门法庭和基层法院的典型试验工作。典型试验的具体任务，是以审判工作为中心，总结审判工作经验，改进和健全审判制度，并从典型试验中逐步地取得专门法庭、巡回法庭、人民接待室、调解委员会、同志审判会和陪审制度等经验，以树立先进的榜样。同时，通过这些组织形式，联系群众，发扬走群众路线的审判工作方法，并从组织制度上把它巩固起来。
    丙、加强检查工作，深入了解情况，是克服官僚主义的最好的方法之一。为帮助下级法院贯彻第二届全国司法会议决议的执行，中央司法部门将在政务院政治法律委员会统一领导下组织若干视察组，有重点地检查若干省、市、县人民法院的工作，各大区、省、市人民法院亦应派检查组下去检查工作。此次检查内容应着重：本届司法会议决议的传达和学习的情形；检查和改正错捕、错押、错判案件和清理积案的情形；普选中人民法庭典型试验计划和进行的情形；干部调配、补充与训练计划和进行的情形；工矿、铁路、水运专门法庭和同志审判会及基层法院典型试验的情形。每个检查组应按照工作进行的情况，每次检查和研究一两个或两三个主要问题，以便把问题真正摸透。检查组必须有具有掌握政策、观察分析能力的干部负责领导。检查组下去前，应详细交代任务和做法，检查组应接受当地党、政领导机关的指导。在检查中应采取实事求是的态度，多方面了解情况和全面分析问题，不仅要检查计划和工作进行的程度，尤其要检查政策执行的情况以及原指示计划本身有无缺点和应加修改之处。要积极指导帮助被检查的单位解决问题改正缺点，不要只是消极地批评。各级司法机关必须以此作为检查工作的准则，并通过检查工作，改善领导，密切上下联系。
    丁、全体司法干部必须认真学习第二届全国司法会议决议、史良部长“关于加强人民司法工作建设的报告”和五月十四日人民日报社论“加强国家建设时期的人民司法工作”等三个文件。学习中，应首先由各级司法机关主要负责同志传达这次会议的决议和精神，并结合本地具体情况加以阐明，对学习文件的干部从思想上加以启发。上述文件，以每天抽出工作时间两小时，共以二十四小时连续学完，以期通过这次学习提高干部思想认识和工作信心，保证决议的正确执行，并为今后建立经常业务学习制度打下基础。
