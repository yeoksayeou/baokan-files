    Welcome the Soviet Sports Delegation
    The Soviet sports delegation, invited by the Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the Central People's Government of our country, arrived in Beijing yesterday. The Chinese people, Chinese sports workers, and athletes express their warm welcome and heartfelt respect to the Soviet sports delegation's visit to our country. The delegation will hold gymnastics performances in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Shenyang. We firmly believe that through the Soviet sports delegation's outstanding performances, the sports movement in our country, especially gymnastics, will be widely developed and improved.
    Under the care and leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, Soviet sports have achieved brilliant accomplishments over the past thirty-five years. At the 15th International Olympic Games held in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, last year, outstanding Soviet athletes created two world records, three European records, and twelve Soviet records, winning first place in the overall score. Especially in gymnastics, both the Soviet men's and women's teams won the glorious title of champion at the 15th International Olympic Games. These victories in sports demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system. As early as 1925, the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party made a resolution on sports issues, pointing out: "Sports must be seen not only from the perspective of physical education and making people healthy as an aspect of culturally, economically, and militarily (shooting sports, etc.) cultivating youth; but also must be seen as a method of educating the masses (because sports develop will, cultivate collective habits, tenacious spirit, calm attitude and other valuable qualities); at the same time, it must be seen as a method of uniting the broad masses of workers and peasants around various Party organizations, Soviet organizations, and trade union organizations, through which the masses of workers and peasants are absorbed into social and political life." Precisely because Soviet sports have this noble political purpose, today it has not only become an important part of communist education, but also has become an important part of the happy life of the broad masses of the people, and an indispensable component of communist construction.
    The Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government have always attached great importance to the development of people's sports. Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, once called for "developing sports and strengthening the people's physique." Over the past year, the mass sports movement throughout the country has made great progress in both popularization and improvement. At present, our country has begun its first five-year plan for national economic construction, and our people must have strong bodies and abundant energy to undertake this glorious and arduous task. Now, the visit of the Soviet sports delegation to our country will undoubtedly promote the further development of the people's sports in our country.
    We all know that due to our learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, our economic construction and cultural construction have already made great achievements; our sports, undoubtedly, must also learn from the Soviet Union, learn from the advanced theory and experience of Soviet sports, learn from the spirit of Soviet sports closely combined with the national construction cause, and develop our mass sports movement in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    We wish the Soviet sports delegation a successful performance during their visit to our country.

    欢迎苏联体育代表团
    应我国中央人民政府体育运动委员会邀请的苏联体育代表团，已于昨日到达北京。中国人民、中国的体育工作者和运动员，对苏联体育代表团来我国访问，表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。代表团将在北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、沈阳等城市举行体操表演。我们坚信，通过苏联体育代表团的卓越的表演，我国人民的体育运动，特别是体操运动将会得到广泛的开展和提高。
    苏联的体育事业，在苏联共产党和苏联政府的关怀和领导下，三十五年来，已有了辉煌的成就。去年在芬兰首都赫尔辛基举行的第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会上，优秀的苏联选手，创造了两项世界纪录、三项欧洲纪录和十二项苏联纪录，荣获总分第一。尤其是体操运动，苏联男女选手队，都赢得了第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会冠军的光荣称号。苏联在体育运动方面的这些胜利，说明了社会主义制度的优越性。早在一九二五年，苏联共产党中央委员会对体育运动问题作了决议，指出：“体育，不仅必须从体力教育和使人健康的观点上看做是文化上经济上和军事上
  （射击运动等）培养青年的一个方面；而且，必须看做是教育群众的一种方法（因为体育发展着意志，养成集体习惯、顽强精神、冷静态度及其它宝贵品质）；同时必须看做是把广大工农群众团结在各个党组织、苏维埃组织和职工会组织周围的方法，经过这些组织，工农群众被吸收参加社会政治生活。”正因为苏联的体育事业具有这种崇高的政治目的，今天它就不仅成了共产主义教育的重要部分，而且，已经成为广大人民幸福生活的一个重要内容，成为共产主义建设中不可缺少的构成部分了。
    中国共产党和中央人民政府，一向就很重视人民体育事业的开展。中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席，曾号召“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”。一年多来，全国范围内的群众性体育运动，无论在普及与提高方面，都有了很大的进展。目前我国已开始了国家经济建设的第一个五年计划，我国人民就必须具有强健的身体和充沛的精力，才能担负起这个光荣而艰巨的任务。现在，苏联体育代表团来我国访问，无疑地将会推动我国人民体育事业的更加向前发展。
    我们都知道：由于我们学习了苏联的先进经验，我国的经济建设和文化建设已经有了很大的成绩；我国的体育事业，无疑地也必须向苏联学习，学习苏联体育运动的先进理论和经验，学习苏联体育运动紧紧结合国家建设事业的精神，有计划、有步骤地开展我国群众性的体育运动。
    我们预祝苏联体育代表团在我国访问期间表演的成功。
