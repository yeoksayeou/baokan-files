Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 9th: To deliver more profits to the state, the Harbin Railway Bureau has recently formulated a production increase and economy plan for transportation operations and subsidiary enterprises, based on the actual completion of the plan in the past eight months and the possible conditions for completing the plan in the next four months. According to this plan, the Harbin Railway Bureau will overfulfill its profit delivery plan by more than 350 billion yuan on the basis of completing its original annual profit plan.

In the first half of this year, all employees of the Harbin Railway Bureau made great efforts to consolidate the existing achievements of the former Chinese Changchun Railway, persisted in carrying out regular labor competitions, continued to promote advanced Soviet experiences and advanced working methods, strengthened transportation planning, and implemented economic accounting, thereby overfulfilling the profit plan for the first half of the year by 87 percent. Now, all employees are working hard on this basis, with full confidence, to complete the new production increase and economy plan.

This newspaper reports: The Northeast Electric Power Administration and the Electric Power Trade Union are organizing a production increase and economy competition focusing on safe power supply and burning inferior coal.

The two major key issues in the Northeast electric power industry are the high number of power supply accidents and the failure to fully exploit the potential of using inferior coal for power generation. In terms of power supply, although the number of accidents has decreased this year compared to last year, the nature of the accidents is more serious. For example, a main power transmission line in the Mudanjiang area was cut three times in a row; a blackout occurred in the entire Fushun area, causing a loss of 1.4 billion yuan to a certain oil factory. The quality of maintenance work is poor, and unplanned maintenance is serious. For example, a generator in the Fushun Power Plant underwent temporary maintenance six times, and in March, four major machines in the power grid were temporarily shut down for maintenance for two days, limiting electricity use in nine major cities in the south. In terms of using inferior coal for power generation, 360,000 tons of inferior coal have been burned in the first half of this year, with the blending rate reaching 44.5 percent in June. However, at present, with the shortage of good coal, there are still large amounts of waste resources in various mines. For example, the gangue left over from coal washing in the Fushun Coal Mine is piled up like mountains. After the Fushun Power Plant successfully tested burning this gangue, 250,000 tons can be utilized annually, saving 80,000 tons of good coal and creating approximately 12 billion yuan of wealth for the country.

The specific requirements of this competition are for each electric power bureau and power plant to eliminate unplanned maintenance and reduce power outage accidents, and to ensure safe and uninterrupted power supply; to require each power plant to complete the inferior coal utilization target, and strive to increase the average inferior coal blending ratio in the entire region from 41.6 percent in the first half of the year to 70 percent, saving the country 200,000 tons of good coal.

    哈尔滨铁路局保证超额完成上缴利润计划
    东北电业系统争取安全供电和燃烧劣煤为国家增产节约
    【新华社哈尔滨九日电】哈尔滨铁路管理局为了多给国家完成上缴利润，最近已根据过去八个月计划的实际完成情况和今后四个月完成计划的可能条件，初步制订了运输营业和附属企业等方面的增产节约计划。根据这一计划，哈尔滨铁路管理局将在完成原订全年利润计划的基础上，超额完成上缴利润三千五百亿元以上。
    哈尔滨铁路管理局全体职工今年上半年在巩固原中国长春铁路的既有成果方面作了很大的努力，坚持开展了经常性的劳动竞赛，继续推广了苏联先进经验和先进工作方法，加强了运输计划性，贯彻了经济核算制，从而超额百分之八十七完成了上半年的利润计划。现在，全体职工们正在这一基础上，怀着充分的信心，为完成新的增产节约计划而努力。
    【本报讯】东北电业管理局和电业工会正在组织以安全供电和燃烧劣煤为内容的增产节约竞赛。
    东北电力工业中的两大关键问题是供电事故多和用劣煤发电的潜力未充分发挥。在供电方面，今年事故次数虽比去年有所减少，但事故性质却较比严重。如牡丹江地区某主力送电线一连断线三次；抚顺曾发生过一次全区停电事故，使某石油厂损失十四亿元。检修工作质量差，无计划的检修现象严重。如抚顺发电厂一台发电机临时检修过六次，三月间曾有两天因电力网内的四台主要机器临时停下检修，限制了南部九个大城市用电。在用劣煤发电方面，今年上半年已烧了三十六万吨劣煤，掺烧率六月份达到百分之四十四点五。但目前在好煤不足的情况下，各矿还有大量的废弃资源。如抚顺煤矿洗煤剩下的矸子堆积如山，抚顺发电厂试烧这种矸石成功后，每年可以利用二十五万吨，可节约好煤八万吨，为国家创造约一百二十亿元的财富。
    这次竞赛具体要求各电业局和发电厂消灭无计划检修和减少停电事故，确切保证安全、不间断地供电；要求各发电厂完成利用劣煤指标，争取全区劣煤掺烧比从上半年平均百分之四十一点六提高到百分之七十，为国家多节约二十万吨好煤。
