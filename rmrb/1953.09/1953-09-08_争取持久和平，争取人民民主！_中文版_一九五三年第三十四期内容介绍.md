    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, 1953, No. 34 Contents Introduction
    The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" 1953, No. 34, has been published.
    The central theme of this issue is the German question. Under the title "Strive for the Restoration of Germany's National Unity on a Peaceful and Democratic Basis," this issue publishes excerpts from the Soviet government's note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on the German question on August 15, publishes the full text of the radio address by Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, to the German people regarding the Soviet note, and publishes an editorial entitled "Strive for the Establishment of a Unified, Independent, Democratic, and Peace-Loving Germany!" The editorial points out that the German question is a major one among the current unresolved international issues. The policy of splitting Germany and restoring German militarism pursued by the imperialist bloc has aroused increasingly strong opposition from the people of Germany and other European countries. The Soviet Union is consistently striving for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, so that Germany can become a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving country. The German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving German people welcome the Soviet government's note with gratitude. The progressive newspapers of various countries unanimously believe that this note is a great contribution to resolving the German question, easing international tensions, and consolidating world peace.
    Important articles published in this issue include: "The Achievements of the Fourth World Youth and Student Festival" by Jacques Denis, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth; "The Newspapers of Italian Factory Workers" by Paolo Robotti, Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party; "Venezuela Under the Shackles of American Monopoly Capital" by Santos Yorme, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Venezuelan Communist Party; and a letter from Vietnam signed "Ding" entitled "Final Victory Will Surely Be Ours."
    Robotti's article points out that a characteristic and important factor of the Italian workers' movement is the vast network of factory newspapers run by workers. In many factories, all workers subscribe to their own newspapers. In addition to discussing internal enterprise issues, these newspapers also publish events of national and international significance, linking domestic and international events with the internal life of the enterprise, which is very helpful in educating politically backward workers. The publication of factory newspapers proves that it is a sharp and effective weapon for conducting struggles, helping workers to safeguard their rights and teaching them how to fight for these rights.
    Yorme's article points out that the American monopoly capital's enslavement and plunder of the Venezuelan people has aroused the resistance of the Venezuelan people. They have found a way to establish a national democratic front. They demand the overthrow of feudal and imperialist rule and the establishment of an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal government headed by the working class.
    The letter from Vietnam summarizes the major achievements made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the first half of this year in the war against the French aggressors, as well as in rectification work and land reform.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版
    一九五三年第三十四期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第三十四期中文版已经出版。
    本期的中心内容是德国问题。本期在“争取在和平民主基础上恢复德国全国统一”的标题下，摘要刊载了苏联政府八月十五日就德国问题致法、英、美三国政府的照会，发表了德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克就苏联照会向德国人民发表的广播演说全文，并发表了题为“争取建立统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国！”的社论。社论指出：德国问题在目前悬而未决的国际问题中是一个主要的问题。帝国主义集团所奉行的分裂德国和恢复德国军国主义的政策，已经激起了德国和欧洲其他各国人民的日益强烈的反对。苏联坚持不渝地为早日缔结对德和约，使德国成为一个统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的国家而努力。德意志民主共和国和所有爱好和平的德国人民，都满怀感激的心情欢迎苏联政府的照会。各国的进步报刊一致认为这个照会对于解决德国问题，对于缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平是一个巨大的贡献。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：世界民主青年联盟总书记雅克·德尼的“第四届世界青年与学生联欢节的成就”，意大利共产党中央委员会候补委员保罗·罗波提的“意大利工厂工人的报纸”，委内瑞拉共产党中央委员会书记桑托斯·约姆的“在美国垄断资本枷锁下的委内瑞拉”，和一封署名丁的题为“最后胜利一定是我们的”的越南来信。
    罗波提的文章指出：意大利工人运动的一个具有特色的重要因素，就是工人所办的广大的工厂报纸分布网。在许多工厂里，全体工人都订阅自己的报纸。这些报纸除了谈企业内部的问题以外，还刊载具有全国性和国际意义的事件，把国内和国际事件和企业内部的生活联系起来，这对于教育政治上比较落后的工人很有帮助。工厂报纸的出版证明它是进行斗争的一种锐利和有效的武器，它帮助工人维护自己的权利，教导他们怎样为争取这些权利而斗争。
    约姆的文章指出：美国垄断资本奴役和掠夺委内瑞拉人民，已经激起了委内瑞拉人民的反抗。他们已经找出了成立民族民主阵线的办法。他们要求推翻封建的和帝国主义的统治，建立以工人阶级为首的反帝反封建的政府。
    越南来信综述了越南人民共和国今年上半年在反对法国侵略者的战争中，以及在整训工作和土地改革等方面所取得的重大成就。    （新华社）
