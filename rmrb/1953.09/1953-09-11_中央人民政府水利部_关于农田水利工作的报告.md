The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government
Report on Farmland Water Conservancy Work

In the past three years, under the leadership of Party and government organs at all levels, more than 3.1 million small-scale projects such as ponds, dams, culverts, and sluices have been built; 730,000 wells have been dug; 214 large-scale irrigation projects have been restored or newly built; more than 30 drainage projects have been completed; and more than 23,000 horsepower of water pumps have been added. Democratic reforms have been universally carried out for the irrigation management of various canals, expanding the irrigated area by approximately 46 million mu. Furthermore, the irrigation and drainage facilities of the original 210 million mu of farmland have been improved, playing a significant role in the recovery and development of agricultural production.

Mass-based small-scale water conservancy is cost-effective, efficient, and quickly yields results, best meeting the current needs of the masses, and thus has achieved relatively prominent results. In the southern regions, agricultural production has become more reliably guaranteed in certain areas due to the widespread mobilization of the masses to build water conservancy projects and improve irrigation and drainage conditions over the past few years. Hunan Province has vigorously carried out the restoration of ponds and dams over the past three years and implemented a dedicated "one hoe" water management system, achieving timely water storage, water conservation, and labor savings for water management. Last winter and this spring, Hubei Province built more than 60,000 water storage projects through work relief, freeing 2.8 million mu of rice fields from the threat of drought. In the East China provinces, nearly 500 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed in the construction of ponds, dams, culverts, dikes, and dredging of rivers, reducing drought and flood disasters. In the northern regions, the number of waterwheels has increased by more than 130 percent, and there has also been a significant increase in the number of wells. Not only has the irrigated area significantly expanded in the original well-irrigated areas such as Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, but it has also gradually expanded to areas such as Shanxi, Suiyuan, Rehe, and Liaoxi. At the same time, as a result of advocating and leading the masses to help each other and jointly irrigate the land, the irrigation capacity of each well has been improved. In many villages in Qingfeng County, Henan Province, Xin County, Shanxi Province, and Li County, Hebei Province, each waterwheel well irrigates an average of more than 40 mu of land, and the irrigation efficiency is doubled compared to before liberation. The most efficient waterwheel well can irrigate more than 80 mu. In the central Hebei and northern Henan areas, many villages have been completely transformed into irrigated land due to the use of groundwater for irrigation, and in some counties, 90 percent of the cultivated land has become irrigated land. In most areas of the Northwest provinces, there is no agriculture without water conservancy. The local Party committees and governments attach great importance to the development of water conservancy. By the end of 1952, the irrigated area had increased by 8.6 million mu, accounting for approximately 34 percent of the original irrigated area.

In terms of the construction of large-scale irrigation projects, many projects damaged by the enemy and puppets and unfinished projects have been restored and repaired, and some new large irrigation areas have been built. In the Northeast region, 52 projects, including Panshan and Dongliao River, have been completed, restoring 1.2 million mu of paddy fields. In the North China provinces, the larger irrigation projects that have been built, irrigating 50,000 mu to 300,000 mu, include 22 projects such as the Xia River and Hutuo River irrigation projects in Shanxi, the Sanggan River and Hun River siltation irrigation projects, and the Shijin Canal and Bohai coastal electric pumping irrigation projects in Hebei. The total area now benefiting is more than 4.1 million mu, which has greatly increased the yield of wheat and cotton and expanded the area of rice cultivation. In the Northwest region, the Luo Hui Canal, which had not been completed in the 16 years before liberation, was continued and irrigated 400,000 mu. The Xinjiang Military Reclamation Corps has built reservoir and canal projects such as the Hongyanchi, Bayi, and Forty-Regiment Canals, expanding the cultivated area by more than 1.6 million mu. Henan Province has repaired the Guangli Canal, restoring the irrigated area to 400,000 mu. The first phase of the Yellow River Diversion to the Wei River project was completed last year and irrigated 280,000 mu, which is a pioneering undertaking in diverting water from the lower reaches of the Yellow River for irrigation. The Douhui Canal in Hunan Province, the Jiangxi Beiliao Canal, and the Maba project in Guangdong Province have all been completed and are benefiting the area. In the East China region, more than ten large-scale projects such as the Tonggong Dam in Anhui, the Huhaitang in Zhejiang, and the Lianbinggang in Fujian have been built, all of which have good effects on rice field irrigation.

Due to the democratic reform of management in various irrigation canals and the organization of mutual assistance for irrigation, the irrigation efficiency has been improved. This is a result of the continuous improvement of the peasants' production enthusiasm and political awareness. In general, the goals of saving labor, saving water, and increasing the yield per unit area in the irrigated area can be achieved. The issue of improving irrigation technology has attracted the attention of some irrigation areas, and in many areas, the masses have changed unreasonable water use habits under the call to cherish water resources, creating and promoting advanced irrigation methods such as furrow irrigation and small-plot irrigation. The Zhulihuo Dike in Sichuan Province originally used unreasonable continuous irrigation methods. After implementing rotational irrigation methods, the irrigated area was expanded by 18,000 mu. Last spring drought, the Fanglai Zhuo Canal in Hebei Province drew less than half the amount of water compared to previous years. Due to attention to management work, the irrigation water for the original 80,000 mu was guaranteed, and the irrigated area was expanded by 30,000 mu.

In the past few years, whenever drought occurred in various places, the local Party and government leading organs have been able to promptly organize a large number of cadres to go deep into the masses to carry out extensive drought resistance struggles, reducing the losses caused by drought. In the Southwest region, continuous spring droughts occurred in 1951 and 1952. Due to timely water lifting, water carrying, and source development, rescue efforts were carried out, saving some summer crops and ensuring rice transplanting. Every year in the North, we advocate soil moisture conservation through plowing and harrowing and lead the masses to resist drought and plant seeds, ensuring the completion of spring sowing tasks.

However, on the other hand, there are serious subjective, isolationist, and bureaucratic styles of leadership in farmland water conservancy work, which have caused many shortcomings and errors in the work. The main ones are as follows:

1.  Due to the fact that agricultural and water conservancy organs at all levels are detached from the needs of the masses when deploying work, disregarding conditions, blindly setting plans, blindly allocating figures downwards, blindly pursuing quantity, lacking specific leadership and technical guidance, and failing to clearly explain policies and work practices, and also setting deadlines for the completion of tasks, a serious style of coercion and formalism has occurred in many areas. The well-drilling work in North China and the pond and dam construction and repair work in the Jiangnan region are mostly not based on reality, greedy for quantity and rashly advancing, detached from the needs and possible conditions of the masses, failing to take into account the actual difficulties of the masses, serious isolationism and coercive commandism, turning good things into bad things, bringing great losses to the masses, and creating a bad influence among the masses.

2.  In large-scale irrigation projects, the main biases are being fond of large projects and being greedy for more, not paying attention to project benefits, and even less attention to water management, with the project being disconnected from the goal of increasing production. At the same time, only focusing on building projects, without considering objective conditions and subjective forces, and not paying attention to collecting and studying basic data before construction, the design work is sloppy, and there is a lack of serious and responsible attitude towards the national construction cause. Many provinces and regions spare no effort to exaggerate the benefits of the project in order to win the approval of the project plan, while we blindly approve the project plan. After the project is built, instead of seriously and responsibly building each one well, implementing it from beginning to end, irrigating the land well, increasing production, focusing on creating models, absorbing experience, and promoting it, we start a new one before one is finished, "setting up stalls everywhere, everywhere is a burden," rashly starting construction, causing many errors, wasting a lot, and the irrigation benefits are not high.

3.  Due to the fact that the agricultural water conservancy leading organs do not provide specific leadership for the completed and existing irrigation canals, and the irrigation management organization is not sound, the irrigation and watering problems in many irrigation areas are in a state of no one being responsible. At present, in most of the larger irrigation areas across the country, the old water use methods of the past are still being followed, the canal system is chaotic, the management is not strict, and large-scale flooding and irrigation waste water. In some irrigation areas in the North China and Northwest provinces, due to the continuous rise of the groundwater level, the soil is deteriorating, the land is becoming alkaline, the cultivated area is gradually shrinking, and the crop yield cannot be increased, or there is a downward trend. In the Jinghui Irrigation Area in Shaanxi, due to errors in cultivation methods and improper water use, production has decreased year by year in recent years, and last year it was less than the harvest of local dry land. The phenomenon of waste of irrigation water and disregard for irrigation methods is also common in the Jiangnan area. No attention has been paid to establishing irrigation experiment stations with a focus on irrigation areas, conducting groundwater observation, crop water requirement experiments, and other basic data investigation and analysis experiments in order to gradually change the old-fashioned irrigation methods.

The main reasons for the above errors are, first of all, that the deployment of work is divorced from the actual situation in rural areas, and there is a lack of correct assessment of the strength of the cadres and their professional and technical level, blindly approving the construction of projects to meet the requirements put forward by various places, lacking work inspection, and a lack of understanding of the mass nature and locality of farmland water conservancy work. Although it was pointed out in the past that it is necessary to rely on the masses, adapt to local conditions, and prevent generalized leadership methods; due to the fact that many water conservancy departments tend to pay attention to doing larger projects, neglecting the leadership of small-scale water conservancy construction and irrigation management that is closely related to the needs of the broad masses of peasants, the mass line has not been well grasped in the issue of mobilizing the masses, the policy boundaries have not been clearly explained, and the specific methods of work have not been explained, resulting in many areas turning good things into bad things. Regarding the situation of forcing the masses to drill wells, we discovered it in May last year. Although we have notified various places to pay attention to prevention, we failed to discover at that time that the main root cause of the coercive command was the subjective leadership, and therefore we failed to correct it. It was not until after the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline was launched that the serious coercive command style in the drought prevention and well-drilling work was exposed, and we gradually clearly realized that for the development of mass water conservancy work, we should not subjectively deploy tasks from top to bottom. The three documents on agricultural production issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in March this year have further enhanced our understanding. And there has also been significant improvement in the work of various places in 1953.

In view of the above situation, the focus of farmland water conservancy work in 1953 and in the future should be on developing mass small-scale water conservancy projects, rectifying existing water conservancy facilities, strengthening irrigation management, and tapping potential to expand the area of irrigation and drainage and increase grain production. As for newly built larger water conservancy irrigation projects, a cautious attitude should be adopted, with a policy of full preparation, steady progress, and selective implementation.

In all water conservancy work, the current reality of the small-scale peasant economy must be taken into account at all times. In order to prevent coercion, any project to be undertaken in the future must be voluntary by the masses. Except for individual households, mutual aid groups, and cooperatives that can solve the problem on their own and do not involve other parties, they should be reviewed and approved by the township people's congress or the district government, or the county government, according to the size and scope involved. And it should be carried out in accordance with the following principles: (1) suitable for local actual needs; (2) affordable by the people and government's financial resources; (3) large benefits, low cost; (4) technically successful. For projects built by the masses themselves by paying money and providing labor, the principle of "those who benefit from more fields should bear more, those who benefit from fewer fields should bear less, and those who do not benefit should not bear" must be implemented. Land occupied from the masses for water conservancy construction must be compensated or adjusted. When mobilizing the masses to build water conservancy projects, it is necessary to seize the slack agricultural season, combine it with agricultural production, and appropriately adjust the labor force to avoid violating the agricultural season as much as possible.

Cadres at all levels should use more typical demonstration methods when leading farmland water conservancy work, educate the masses with practical examples, and summarize and exchange the existing successful experiences among the masses. At the same time, provinces and special zones can organize small water conservancy work teams as needed to strengthen technical guidance for mass water conservancy work, and can hold short-term training courses as appropriate to train the masses to master technology.

The threat of drought and flood disasters to us is still serious and long-term. In order to overcome drought and flood, we must have long-term plans and actively lead the masses to gradually solve the problem year by year according to the specific situation. We must not be impatient or rash. Of course, the problem of solving drought and flood cannot be solved by the water conservancy department alone. The agricultural, forestry, water conservancy departments, and scientific institutions must formulate a comprehensive long-term plan and work together and cooperate with each other to solve it. In water conservancy work, according to the current characteristics of the decentralized small-scale peasant economy in rural areas and the current level of national financial resources and industrialization, developing mass small-scale water conservancy is the most effective and should be one of the key tasks in the work of the water conservancy department. Small-scale water conservancy projects are not technically demanding, are easily mastered by the masses, can use local materials, can provide labor locally, do not cost much, and can quickly see results, and can solve a lot of problems in drought and flood prevention. The experience of the past three years has also proved this. The small reservoirs built in various parts of Jiangnan can not only solve the problem of drought prevention and drought resistance, but also reduce local mountain flood disasters and downstream flood disasters. In certain areas, farmland water conservancy must also be planned comprehensively, and it is necessary to combine drought prevention, flood prevention, and flood control as much as possible, and avoid taking neighbors as ditches or other upstream and downstream disputes and unplanned competition with water for land. However, when leading the masses to carry out work, it is necessary to prevent this work from being regarded as a temporary surprise task that can only be used temporarily and will not work after a while, but to do one thing well at a time, so that it will have a longer-term effect.

For irrigation management, it is necessary to earnestly improve the leadership of the existing irrigation canal systems, especially to overcome the bureaucratic leadership that does not go deep into the masses, does not conduct in-depth research, and does not provide specific guidance, and the phenomenon of no one being responsible. The problem of watering and irrigating in the irrigation area must be handled by dedicated personnel in sections, with specific guidance, summarizing the irrigation experience of the masses, conducting irrigation experiments, and gradually implementing water distribution plans adapted to the needs of crops and soil, and striving to use water rationally and prevent soil alkalization, in order to lay the foundation for scientific water use. The water fees paid by the masses in the irrigation area can only be used for the annual repairs, maintenance, and management personnel expenses of the irrigation area, so they must be collected according to the lowest proportion according to the local economic strength of the masses. For the irrigation problems of wells, waterwheels, ponds and dams, and small canals built by the masses themselves, it is necessary to advocate organization and help the masses to establish organizations for managing water use in order to use water rationally and give play to potential capabilities, but it must be based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and must not be forced.

For state-owned canals, in order to eliminate the "supply system thinking" and promote the continued development of work, in principle, they should be gradually operated as enterprises without increasing the original water fee burden on the masses. However, due to the fact that the current irrigation management organization is not sound, there are too many people employed, high expenses, and a lot of waste, which is a general phenomenon, the widespread implementation of enterprise management will inevitably increase the water fee expenses of farmers. Therefore, at present, only from the state-owned irrigation projects that have a habit of collecting water fees and that farmers also believe that the water fees collected are not high, the provincial water conservancy organs should select one or two places and focus on trying out enterprise management methods, gaining experience, and then the central Ministry of Water Resources will summarize the experience, formulate methods, and promote it. Avoid being impatient and rashly advancing and universally implementing it, which will increase the burden on the masses and affect water conservancy irrigation.

    中央人民政府水利部
    关于农田水利工作的报告
    三年来，在各级党政机关的领导下，共兴修小型塘坝涵闸等工程三百一十多万处，凿井七十三万眼，恢复及新建大型灌溉工程二百一十四处，排水工程三十余处，添置抽水机二万三千多马力，对于各个渠道的灌溉管理，普遍进行了民主改革，共计扩大灌溉面积约四千六百多万亩，并在原有二亿一千多万亩的农田上，改善了灌溉排水设施，对农业生产的恢复和发展，起了显著的作用。
    群众性的小型水利，费省效宏，见效快，最适合当前群众的需要，因而有较突出的成绩。在南方地区，由于几年来普遍发动群众兴修水利，改善了灌溉与排水的条件，农业生产已在一定地区内有了比较可靠的保证。湖南省由于三年来大力进行了塘坝的恢复工作，并推行了“一把锄头”的专人负责用水管理制度，做到能及时蓄水，节约用水，节省了看水人工。湖北省去冬今春以工代赈兴办了六万多处蓄水工程，使二百八十万亩水稻摆脱干旱威胁。在华东各省兴修塘坝、涵闸、圩堤及疏浚河道等工程近五亿土方，减轻了旱涝灾害。在北方地区，水车增加百分之一百三十以上，水井也有大量增加，不但在原来的水井灌溉地区如河北、山东、河南等省灌溉面积显著扩大，并逐渐发展到山西、绥远、热河、辽西等地区，同时由于提倡并领导群众互助合伙浇地的结果，提高了每眼水井的灌溉能力，在河南省清丰县、山西省忻县、河北省蠡县等不少村庄已达到全村平均每眼水车井浇地四十多亩，灌溉效率比解放前提高一倍。最多的一眼水车井能浇到八十多亩。在河北中部及河南北部地区，由于利用地下水灌溉，很多村庄已全部变为水地，有的县份，百分之九十的耕地成为水地。西北各省大部地区，无水利即无农业，当地党委、政府对发展水利极为重视，截至一九五二年止，共增加了八百六十万亩水地，约当原有水地的百分之三十四。
    在大型灌溉工程建设方面，恢复和修建了许多敌伪破坏及未完成的工程，并新建了一些大灌溉区。东北区完成了盘山、东辽河等五十二处工程，恢复稻田一百二十万亩。在华北各省，兴办的较大灌溉工程中，灌田五万亩至三十万亩的有山西潇河、滹沱河灌溉工程，桑乾河、浑河淤灌工程，河北石津渠、渤海沿岸电力抽水灌溉工程等二十二处，现已受益的共四百一十多万亩，大面积地提高了小麦棉花产量，扩大了水稻种植面积。西北区续修了解放前十六年未能完成的洛惠渠，灌溉四十万亩。新疆军垦部队修建了红雁池、八一、四十团渠等水库渠道工程，扩大了一百六十多万亩耕地面积。河南省整修了广利渠，恢复灌溉面积四十万亩。引黄济卫第一期工程已于去年完工并灌田二十八万亩，是在黄河下游引水灌溉的创举。湖南省的陡惠渠、江西北缭渠、广东省马坝工程等都已完工受益。华东区兴修了安徽佟公坝、浙江湖海塘、福建莲柄港等十余处大型工程，对稻田灌溉，都有较好效果。
    各灌溉渠道，由于进行了管理上的民主改革，并进行组织起来互助浇地，灌溉效率已见提高，这是由于农民生产热情及政治觉悟不断提高的结果。一般的都能做到省工、省水及提高灌溉区单位面积产量的目的。改进灌溉技术问题，已引起部分灌区的重视，并有不少地区的群众，在珍惜水量的号召下，改变了不合理的用水习惯，创造并推行了沟灌、小畦灌溉等进步的灌水方法。四川省朱李火埝原来用不合理的续灌办法灌田，实行了轮灌方法后，扩大了灌溉面积一万八千亩。河北省房涞涿渠，去年春旱，引水量不及往年一半，由于注意管理工作，保证了原有八万亩的灌溉用水，并扩大了三万亩的灌溉面积。
    几年来，各地一遇旱象发生，当地党政领导机关都能及时组织大批干部，深入群众，开展广泛的抗旱斗争，减免了旱灾损失。西南区一九五一和一九五二两年连续春旱，由于及时车水、挑水、开发水源，进行抢救，挽救了部分夏收作物，保证了水稻插秧。北方每年都提倡耕耙保墒和领导群众抗旱点种，保证春播任务的完成。
    但另一方面，在农田水利的领导工作中，存在着严重的脱离实际、脱离群众的主观主义、官僚主义，造成了工作中许多缺点与错误。主要的有以下数点：
    一、由于各级农业水利机关，在布置工作时脱离群众需要，不顾条件，盲目定计划，盲目往下分配数字，盲目追求数量，缺乏具体领导和技术指导，而又没有交代清楚政策和工作做法，还要限期完成任务，以致在不少地区发生了严重的强迫命令、形式主义的作风。华北地区的打井工作、江南地区的塘坝兴修整修工作，多有不从实际出发，贪多冒进，脱离群众需要与可能的条件，不照顾群众实际困难，严重脱离群众的官僚主义及强迫命令作风，把好事办成坏事，给群众带来很大的损失，并在群众中造成不良影响。
    二、在大型灌溉工程上，主要偏向是好大贪多，不注意工程效益，更不注意用水管理，工程与增产目的脱节。同时，只图兴办工程，不考虑客观条件和主观力量，在兴办前也不注意收集研究基本资料，设计工作粗枝大叶，对国家建设事业缺乏严肃负责的态度，不少省区为了争取工程计划的批准，又不惜夸大工程效益，而我们则是盲目地批准工程计划；在工程兴办以后不是认真负责地办一处就办好一处，贯彻始终，浇好地，增了产，有重点地创造典型，吸收经验，加以推广，而是一处未完，又办一处，“到处摆摊子，到处是包袱”，贸然开工，造成很多错误，浪费很大，灌溉效益不高。
    三、由于农业水利领导机关对已成的及旧有的灌溉渠，多数不加具体领导，灌溉管理机构不健全，致使许多灌区的灌水浇地问题，处于无人负责状态。目前全国多数较大灌区，一直承袭着过去旧的用水方法，渠系紊乱，管理不严，大水漫灌，浪费水量。在华北、西北诸省中的一些灌区，由于地下水位不断上升，土壤恶化，土地泛碱，耕地面积逐渐缩小，作物产量不能提高，或有下降趋势。陕西泾惠灌区，由于耕种方法的错误及用水不当，近年来，逐年减产，去年不足当地旱田收成。江南地区灌溉用水的浪费和不讲求灌溉方法的现象也是普遍的。对于灌溉方法及土壤改良等工作，也没有注意在灌区有重点地建立灌溉试验站，进行地下水观察、作物需水量试验以及其他一些基本资料的调查分析试验等工作，以逐渐改变旧式的灌溉方法。
    造成以上错误的主要原因，首先是布置工作时，脱离农村实际情况，对干部的力量及其业务、技术水平缺乏正确的估计，盲目地批准修建工程，以满足各地所提出的要求，缺乏工作检查，对农田水利工作的群众性与地方性认识不足。过去虽曾指出要依靠群众，因地制宜，防止一般化的领导方法；由于很多水利部门偏于注意做较大工程，忽视了广大农民切身需要的小型水利兴修及灌溉管理的领导，故在发动群众问题上，未能很好地掌握群众路线，未交代清政策界限，也没有讲明工作的具体作法，致使不少地区把好事办成坏事。关于强迫群众打井情形，去年五月时已为我们所发现，虽曾通报各地注意防止，但当时未能发现造成强迫命令的主要根源是领导上的主观主义，因而未能纠正。直到反对官僚主义、命令主义及违法乱纪的斗争开展后，揭发了防旱打井工作中的严重强迫命令作风，我们才逐渐明确认识到对于发展群众性的水利工作，不可主观地自上而下地布置任务。今年三月间中共中央所发布的关于农业生产的三个文件，更使我们在认识上提高了一步。而各地在一九五三年的工作中，也有显著的改善。
    针对以上情况，一九五三年及今后的农田水利工作，应着重开展群众性的各种小型水利，整顿现有水利设施，加强灌溉管理，发掘潜在力量，以扩大灌溉与排涝面积，增加粮食生产。至于新办的较大的水利灌溉工程，则应采取慎重态度，充分准备、稳步前进、择要举办的方针。
    在一切水利工作中要随时照顾目前小农经济的现实情况。为了防止强迫命令，今后兴办任何一个工程，都须群众自愿，除单干户、互助组、合作社能自行解决又不牵涉其他方面者外，均应按照规模的大小，牵涉的方面，分别经过乡人民代表大会或区政府、或县政府加以审核和批准。并应按照以下的原则进行：（一）适合当地实际需要；（二）为人民与政府财力所许可；（三）受益大，花钱少；
  （四）技术上有成功把握。对于由群众出钱出工自办的工程，必需贯彻“受益田亩多的多负担，受益田亩少的少负担，不受益的不负担”的原则。兴修水利占用群众的土地，一定要给予调剂或赔偿。在动员群众兴修水利时，一定要抓住农闲季节，结合农业生产，适当调剂劳动力，尽可能地做到不违农时。
    各级干部在领导农田水利工作时应更多的采用典型示范的方法，以实际例证教育群众，并总结群众中现有的成功经验加以交流。同时省及专区可根据需要组织小型水利工作队，以加强对群众水利工作的技术指导，并可酌情举办短期训练班，培养群众掌握技术。
    旱涝灾害对我们的威胁，仍然是严重的，而且是长期性的。为了战胜旱涝，必须有长远打算，根据具体情况，积极地领导群众一年一年地逐步加以解决，不能操之过急，盲目冒进。当然，解决旱涝问题，只靠水利部门是不能胜任的，必须农业、林业、水利各部门以及科学机关订出综合的长远计划，共同努力、相互配合，才能解决。在水利工作上，根据目前农村分散的小农经济特点，及目前国家财力和工业化的程度，以开展群众性的小型水利最为有效，应当作为水利部门工作中重点任务之一。小型水利工程，技术性不高，易为群众所掌握，可就地取材，就地出工，费用不多，且能很快见到效果，在防旱防涝工作中能够解决很大问题。三年来的经验也证明了这一点。江南各地举办的小型水库，不仅能够解决防旱抗旱问题，而且能够减少当地山洪灾害及下游洪水灾害。而在一定地区内，农田水利也要通盘筹划，尽可能地做到防旱、防涝、防洪三者互相结合，并避免以邻为壑或其他上下游纠纷以及无计划地与水争地等现象。但在领导群众进行工作时，必须防止把这一工作当作临时突击任务，只能临时用一下，过后就不起作用，而是要作一处好一处，使其发生较长久的效益。
    对于灌溉管理方面，必须认真改善现有灌溉渠系的领导，特别要克服不深入群众，不深入研究，不进行具体指导的官僚主义的领导与无人负责的现象。灌区内的灌水浇地问题，一定要专人分段负责、具体指导，总结群众的灌溉经验，进行灌溉试验，并逐步实行与作物和土壤需要相适应的配水计划，努力做到合理用水和防止土壤碱化，以打下科学用水的基础。灌区群众所交的水费，只能用于本灌区的岁修养护及管理人员的开支，故须根据当地群众经济力量，按最低比例征收。关于水井、水车、塘坝及群众自己兴修的小渠道的灌溉问题，应提倡组织起来，帮助群众成立管理用水的组织，以期合理用水，发挥潜在能力，但必须根据自愿互利原则，不得强迫。
    对于国营渠道，为了消除“供给制思想”，并推动工作继续向前发展，在不增加原来群众水费负担的条件下，原则上应逐步实行企业化经营。但由于目前灌溉管理机构不健全，用人多、开支大、浪费多，是一般现象，广泛推行企业化，势必增加农民水费的开支，因此目前只能从原有收水费习惯，农民亦认为所收水费不高的国营灌溉事业中，由省水利机关选择一、二处，重点试行企业化的经营办法，取得经验，然后再由中央水利部总结经验，制订办法，加以推广。切忌急躁冒进，普遍推行，致增加群众负担，影响水利灌溉。
