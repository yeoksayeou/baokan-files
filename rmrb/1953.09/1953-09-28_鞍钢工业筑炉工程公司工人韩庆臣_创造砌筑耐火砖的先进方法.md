Anshan Iron and Steel Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company worker Han Qingchen created an advanced method of parallel assembly line bricklaying with both hands for refractory bricks in July of this year during the construction of the No. 15 and 16 coke oven project. After the advanced method of parallel assembly line bricklaying of refractory bricks with both hands was created, it was assessed by Soviet experts and various parties who all agreed that this was a great contribution to industrial furnace construction engineering by worker Han Qingchen. For this reason, in addition to vigorously promoting this advanced working method on various construction sites, the company also provided spiritual and material rewards to the creator of this advanced method, worker Han Qingchen. After more than two months of experimentation and promotion by the company, it has been proven that this method is not only suitable for the construction of coke oven projects, but also for the construction of various furnace projects such as iron-smelting furnaces, heating furnaces, hot blast stoves, soaking furnaces, roasting furnaces, and reduction furnaces.

This advanced method of bricklaying of refractory bricks is completely different from the old method of bricklaying refractory bricks. There are more than a thousand types of refractory bricks. Each type of brick with different properties must be bonded with mortar of different properties. The horizontal surface between bricks cannot differ by half a millimeter, and there can be no gaps between the bricks. In the past, the old method of bricklaying only divided into two processes: bricklaying and grouting. During bricklaying, a worker would hold a refractory brick in his left hand and a large trowel in his right hand, applying mortar to the brick one stroke at a time before laying it. Therefore, those with high technical skills could lay bricks quickly and ensure better quality; those with low technical skills would lay bricks slowly and could not guarantee quality. Now, Han Qingchen discovered that bricks could be laid without applying mortar with a trowel but instead using a dipping method. The original labor organization was changed to three processes: mortar application (including brick arrangement and line hanging), bricklaying, and grouting (including cleaning), with each process being the responsibility of dedicated personnel, implementing parallel assembly line operations.

Based on the No. 15 and 16 coke oven project, the implementation of this new method has many advantages compared to the old method: First of all, it accelerates the progress of the project. In the past, using the old method, an average of only 40 to 50 tons of refractory bricks could be laid per day, with a maximum of no more than 80 tons. Now, 160 tons can be laid per day, with a maximum of 209 tons. Second, it guarantees the quality of the project. In the past, because the time between mortar application and bricklaying was too long, the mortar was uneven, and the bonding degree was insufficient, affecting the life of the furnace body. Now, the time between mortar application and bricklaying is very short, the mortar is uniform, and the bonding degree is enhanced, which can extend the life of the furnace body. Third, it saves manpower and reduces costs. According to the old method, 250 more people would have to be added to complete this task. Now, using the dipping method can not only reduce manpower but also complete the task a month earlier. (Chang Gong) (Picture attached)

    创造砌筑耐火砖的先进方法
    鞍钢工业筑炉工程公司工人韩庆臣，在今年七月间修筑十五、十六号炼焦炉工程中，创造了双手蘸浆平行流水砌筑耐火砖的先进方法。双手蘸浆平行流水砌筑耐火砖的先进方法创造以后，经苏联专家与各方面的鉴定，都认为这是工人韩庆臣对工业筑炉工程的一个伟大贡献。为此，该公司除在各工地上大力推广这一先进工作法外，并给予这一先进方法的创造者——工人韩庆臣以精神与物质的奖励。经该公司两个多月来的实验和推广，已经证明这一方法不仅适用于修筑炼焦炉工程，也同样适合于修筑炼铁炉、加热炉、热风炉、均热炉、焙烧炉与还原炉等各种筑炉工程。
    这种砌筑耐火砖的先进方法，与过去旧式砌筑耐火砖的方法完全不同。耐火砖样式有一千多种，每种不同性质的砖要用不同性质的灰浆黏结，砖与砖的水平面不能相差半个公厘，砖与砖之间还不能有任何空隙。过去旧式砌筑的方法，只分砌砖和抅缝两道工序，在砌砖时，则是一个工人，左手拿着一块耐火砖，右手拿着一把大铲子，把灰浆一下下往砖上抹，抹完后再砌。因此，技术水平高的，就砌的快，质量也比较好；技术水平低的，就砌的慢，还保证不了质量。现在，韩庆臣在砌砖中，发现砌砖可以不用铲子抹浆，改用蘸浆的办法。把原来的劳动组织，改为铺灰（包括排砖与挂线）、砌砖和抅缝（包括清扫）等三道工序，每道工序都有专人负责，实行平行流水作业。
    根据十五、十六号炼焦炉工程来看，实行这种新的方法以后，比起过去旧的方法来，有很多优点：首先就是加速了工程进度。过去采用旧的方法，每天砌筑耐火砖，平均只能砌四、五十吨，最多也超不过八十吨，现在每天能砌一百六十吨，最多可达到二百零九吨。第二，保证了工程质量。过去因为挂浆与砌筑时间相距太长，灰浆不均匀，黏结程度不够，影响炉体寿命；现在挂浆与砌筑时间相距很短，灰浆均匀，黏结程度增强，可以延长炉体寿命。第三，节省人力，降低成本。如按老办法，要完成这一任务，就得增加二百五十人，现在采用蘸浆法，不但可以减少人，还能提前一个月完成任务。　（常工）（附图片）
