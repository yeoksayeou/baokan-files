    After Careful Inspection and Repeated Calculations, Shanxi Province Sets Four-Month Production Increase and Thrift Plan
    Shanxi Province has formulated a specific plan for the whole province to "increase production, increase income, practice strict economy, and tighten expenditures." After careful inspection and repeated calculations, it has been determined that in the next four months, the province will increase production and save 18.7 trillion yuan for the state, striving to reach 20 trillion yuan. Among them, saving national financial expenditure and increasing financial revenue will be about 6.3 trillion yuan, striving to reach about 7 trillion yuan. In addition, 200 million jin of grain will be transferred out in excess of the quota.
    The main links for increasing production and practicing thrift in Shanxi Province are in industry, transportation, and expanding urban-rural exchanges. In order to rapidly and deeply carry out this movement in industry and transportation, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued an emergency instruction, pointing out that the three links in carrying out this movement are: First, the movement to increase production and practice thrift must be closely integrated with the continued strengthening of planned management. Second, effective technical and organizational measures must be taken based on the specific goals of increasing production and practicing thrift and the key problems in production. Third, fully utilize the wisdom of the masses of workers, carry out rationalization proposals, promote advanced experience, and earnestly implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. Prevent rushing, prevent quality degradation, and prevent accidents. The movement to increase production and practice thrift will first be launched in various factories and mines in Taiyuan City, striving to enter a climax throughout the province around National Day.
    In terms of expanding urban-rural exchanges, the main tasks are to do a good job in purchasing grain, cotton, native products, and supplying consumer goods, means of production, and grain.
    This plan was fully discussed at a conference of more than 500 Party member cadres at the county Party committee secretary, county head, factory and mine Party committee secretary, and factory director levels in the province, and the plan for increasing production and practicing thrift was further enriched and revised. During the discussion, everyone deeply felt that there was great potential in all aspects. As long as it is reasonably organized and adjusted, it can not only greatly increase production and practice thrift, but also promote the improvement of various tasks. After the meeting, members of the Provincial Party Committee went to factories and mines and rural areas to inspect work with a focus, in order to promote the rapid action of the entire Party.

    经过认真检查和反复计算后
    山西省订出四个月增产节约计划
    山西全省“增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支”的具体方案业已制订。经过认真检查和反复计算后，已确定在今后四个月内为国家增产节约一万八千七百亿元，争取达到二万亿元。其中节省国家财政开支和增加财政收入六千三百亿元左右，争取达到七千亿元左右。此外并将超额调出粮食二亿斤。
    山西省增产节约的主要环节是在工业运输和扩大城乡交流方面。为在工业运输方面迅速深入开展这一运动，中共山西省委已发出了紧急指示，指出开展这一运动的三个环节是：一、要把增产节约运动与继续加强计划管理紧密结合。二、必须根据增产节约的具体奋斗目标和生产上的关键问题，采取有效的技术组织措施。三、充分发挥职工群众智慧，开展合理化建议，推广先进经验，认真执行苏联专家建议。防止突击、防止质量降低、防止事故发生。增产节约运动首先在太原市各厂矿展开，争取国庆节前后全省进入高潮。
    在扩大城乡交流方面，主要是做好购粮、购棉、购土产和作好生活资料、生产资料及粮食的供应等工作。
    这一方案在全省中共县委书记、县长、厂矿党委书记、厂长以上党员干部五百余人大会上进行了充分的讨论，进一步充实与修定了增产节约方案。讨论中大家深刻感到在各方面都存在着很大潜力，只要经过合理的组织与调整，不仅可以大大增产节约，还可以推动各方面工作的改进。会后省委委员即分头有重点地深入厂矿和农村检查工作，以推动全党迅速行动起来。（鲁生、金雨困）
