    Japanese Painters Toshiko Akamatsu and Iri Maruki
    ——An Introduction to the Artists Awarded the International Peace Prize and Gold Medal in 1952, Part 3
    Shen Jia
    Toshiko Akamatsu and Iri Maruki, the husband and wife who were awarded the World Peace Council's International Peace Gold Medal in 1952, collaborated on the "Atomic Bomb Paintings," which powerfully expose and condemn the inhumane and cruel crime of the American imperialists dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. This is a successful work that expresses the common will of the Japanese people and the people of the world to love peace and hate war.
    There are currently six parts to the "Atomic Bomb Paintings": "Ghosts," "Fire," "Water," "Rainbow," "Boys and Girls," and "Atomic Wasteland."
    These paintings are drawn on Eastern painting paper using ink containing charcoal. After the painting is completed, it is moistened with water to allow the charcoal to penetrate the paper, which is said to preserve it for a long time. Each part is composed of eight panels, each panel two meters high and one meter wide, making each complete part two meters high and eight meters wide. For the convenience of mobile exhibitions, they were initially made in the form of folding screens, which could be opened or folded. Later, they were converted into scrolls. These are all creations of the couple. American imperialists and the Yoshida reactionary government have tried every possible way to obstruct the exhibition of these paintings, but their efforts were in vain. These paintings are not only easy to carry, but also can be quickly opened for exhibition as soon as they arrive at the exhibition site, and quickly put away after the exhibition is over. In this way, these paintings have been exhibited in more than fifty different cities and regions in Japan, a total of more than four hundred times, with more than three million viewers. Once, when it was exhibited in Tokyo, an American painter visited and said that the painting was very great, but he had a little regret, he thought that this painting method was easy to damage, and should be changed to oil painting. It can be seen that this American painter completely did not understand the intention of the authors of the "Atomic Bomb Paintings" and the combat form they adopted.
    The "Atomic Bomb Paintings" have had a powerful propaganda and educational effect among the broad masses of the Japanese people. When they were first exhibited, some people said that they were painted too exaggeratedly, but the masses did not think so at all. An old man who witnessed the tragedy caused by the atomic bomb in Hiroshima said angrily: These paintings are not exaggerated at all, the actual situation is even more tragic than this! The old man asked the two painters to paint more tragic scenes and protest against the inhuman aggressors! The old man's words reflect the voice of millions of Japanese people and their determination to oppose aggressive war and defend peace.
    Toshiko Akamatsu and her husband, Iri Maruki, are two painters with different painting skills. Iri Maruki has a high level of attainment in the techniques of Japanese classical painting tradition, while Toshiko Akamatsu is well-versed in Western sketching methods. However, in these works, they jointly created a harmonious, unified, and new form of expression with national traditional style. The more than two hundred realistic figures on the screen, and the expression method that omits unnecessary backgrounds and focuses on rendering the atmosphere after the catastrophe, have achieved a very successful effect.
    In the past, they were both members of the Japan Art and Culture Association hosted by Ichiro Fukuzawa. After the end of World War II, artistic and ideological differences occurred within this group. Ichiro Fukuzawa and most of the other painters fell into the quagmire of bourgeois formalism art such as Surrealism and Cubism; while another group of painters, including Toshiko Akamatsu and Iri Maruki, left this group and formed the Avant-Garde Art Association, armed themselves with the ideas of people's democracy, crossed the various forms of formalism of the bourgeoisie, and embarked on the road of fighting realism. The "Atomic Bomb Paintings" are the initial achievements of Akamatsu and Maruki.

    日本画家赤松俊子和丸木位里
    ——国际和平奖金和金质奖章一九五二年得奖美术家介绍之三
    沈嘉
    世界和平理事会国际和平金质奖章一九五二年得奖者赤松俊子和丸木位里他们夫妇合作的“原子弹之画”，有力地揭露和控诉了美帝国主义者把原子弹投掷在广岛的那种惨无人道的残酷的罪行。这是表现了日本人民和全世界人民热爱和平、憎恶战争的共同意志的一部成功的作品。
    “原子弹之画”现有六部：“幽灵”、“火”、“水”、“虹”、“少男少女”和“原子原野”。
    这些画是采用了东方的画纸，用墨绘制的，墨里有炭，画成后用水浸湿，使炭渗进纸去，据说可以保存到很久远的年代。每一部由八张画幅拼合而成，每张画幅高二公尺宽一公尺，每部全画高二公尺宽八公尺。为了流动展览的方便，起初是做成了屏风的形式，可以打开也可以折叠，后来又把它们改装成卷轴。这些都是他们夫妇的创造。美帝国主义者和吉田反动政府百般地阻挠这些画的展出，可是结果还是枉费心机。这些画不但便于携带，而且一到展出的地方，立刻可以很快地把画打开，展览完了，又可以很快地收起。就这样，这些画曾在日本的五十个以上不同城市与地区展出过，前后共展出了四百多次，观众在三百万人以上。有一次在东京展出时，一个美国画家去参观，他说这画非常伟大，但有点遗憾，他认为这样画法容易损坏，应改画成油画。可见这位美国画家是完全不理解“原子弹之画”的作者的意图和他们所采取的这种战斗的形式。
    “原子弹之画”在日本的广大人民群众中发生了强大的宣传教育作用。当他们第一次展出时，竟有些人说他们画得太夸张了，可是群众却完全不是这样看法。曾在广岛目击原子弹所造成的惨状的一位老人愤怒地说：这些画一点也不夸张，实际情况比这还要惨！老人要求这两位画家画出更多的惨酷场面，向灭绝人性的侵略者提出抗议！这位老人的话反映了千百万日本人民的心声和他们反对侵略战争保卫和平的决心。
    赤松俊子和她的丈夫丸木位里，是具有不同绘画素养的两位画家，丸木位里对于日本古典绘画传统的技法有着较高的造诣，赤松俊子则对于西方的素描方法研究有素。然而他们在这几部作品中共同创造了和谐统一的、具有民族传统风格的新的表现形式。画面上两百多个真实的人物形象，和那种省略了不必要的背景而集中地渲染了劫后气氛的表现方法，获得了很成功的效果。
    他俩过去都是福泽一郎主持的日本美术文化协会的会员，第二次大战结束以后，这个团体内部发生了艺术思想上的分歧，福泽一郎和其他大部分画家陷于超现实派、立体派等等资产阶级形式主义艺术的泥沼中；而另一部分画家包括赤松俊子和丸木位里则离开了这一群，另组前卫美术协会，用人民民主的思想武装了自己，跨越了资产阶级的各种形式主义，走向了战斗的现实主义的道路。“原子弹之画”就是赤松和丸木的最初成就。
