The Jilin Electric Power Bureau lacked thorough planning in carrying out power outage maintenance work. It did not have close coordination with various factories and mines beforehand, and the temporarily determined maintenance outage times were repeatedly changed, thus harming the production and maintenance work of the local paper mill and other enterprises. For example, on March 22nd, the Dispatch Section of the Jilin Electric Power Bureau notified the local paper mill that all power would be cut off for four hours on April 13th; on April 6th, it was changed to April 15th; at 1:00 PM on April 13th, it was changed again to April 17th; at 8:20 AM on the 15th, it was announced that power would be cut off that day, and at 9:30 AM it was announced that there would be no power cut, but at 12:00 PM on the 16th, all power to the paper mill was suddenly cut off for four hours and forty-five minutes. On that day, the paper mill's paper machines, wood grinders, and steam boilers generally reduced production due to the power outage, resulting in a total loss of 53,394 kilograms of paper. Another example is the two power outages on April 26th. The Jilin Electric Power Bureau notified that the planned interval was six hours, but the actual interval was seven and a half hours, and there was no notification before the power outage that the voltage would be reduced between the two outages. As a result, due to the low voltage, the current increased by a quarter, causing the motors to generally overheat and the paper speed to slow down, affecting safety. That day, the factory also reduced production by 15,650 kilograms of paper and 6,885 kilograms of groundwood pulp.

After studying the above situation, the General Administration of Electric Power Management recently issued a circular, instructing all local electric power bureaus to learn from the lessons of the Jilin Electric Power Bureau and substantially improve their work. The circular pointed out that the Jilin Paper Mill is not the only unit to have suffered losses due to the lack of planning and leadership in the work of the electric power bureau. Other industrial and mining enterprises have suffered even more serious losses. On a national scale, the lack of unified planning for power outage maintenance is a widespread problem. Taiyuan, Dalian, Xi'an, Harbin, and other places have experienced frequent accidents due to poorly executed unified maintenance work, seriously affecting the normal operation of industrial and mining production, especially the heavy industry production, which suffered even greater losses. The circular requires all local electric power bureaus across the country to cooperate closely with users in a responsible manner and, in accordance with the instructions of the National Electricity Supply and Consumption Conference on unified cooperative maintenance work, to do a good job in unified cooperative maintenance work. The principle of unified cooperation should be that the secondary serves the primary, transmission, transformation, and distribution serve power generation, and light loads serve heavy loads. Whether it is the electric power bureau or the user, they should, based on this principle, consider the issue of cooperative maintenance from the perspective of overall interests, and should not unilaterally emphasize their own convenience and only require other units to cooperate. The circular finally pointed out that unified maintenance work is also an important measure to tap the potential of electricity consumption and an important task to strengthen planned management. It requires all bureaus to seriously examine their work and summarize the implementation of unified cooperative maintenance so as to exchange experiences and promote the work.

    吉林电业局检修工作缺乏统一计划
    电业管理总局通报各地切实改进统一检修工作
    吉林电业局在执行停电检修的工作中缺乏周密的计划性，与各厂矿用户事先既没有密切的配合，而临时确定的检修停电时间又屡次变更，因而损害了该地造纸厂等的生产和检修工作。例如，吉林电业局调度科三月二十二日通知该地纸厂四月十三日全部停电四小时；四月六日又通知改为四月十五日；四月十三日午后一时又通知改为十七日；十五日早晨八时二十分又通知在当天停电，九时半又通知不停，但在十六日十二时却突然停了纸厂全部电源达四小时四十五分。当日纸厂的各抄纸机、碎木机、蒸锅普遍因停电而减产，纸的损失共达五万三千三百九十四公斤。再如四月二十六日的两次停电，吉林电业局通知计划间隔是六小时，而实际中间间隔七小时半，而且在停电前没有通知在两次停电中间电压降低，结果由于电压过低，电流升高四分之一，使得电动机普遍发生了发热和抄速减慢等现象，影响了安全，当天该厂又减产纸一万五千六百五十公斤，并减产碎木纸浆六千八百八十五公斤。
    电业管理总局研究了以上情况之后，最近特发出通报，要各地电业局接受吉林电业局的教训，切实改进工作。通报中指出：由于电业局的检修工作无计划无领导因而受到损失的，绝不只吉林造纸厂一个单位，其他工矿企业的损失还有更严重的。就全国范围来说，停电检修没有统一计划，更是一个带有普遍性的问题，太原、大连、西安、哈尔滨等地都曾由于统一检修工作没有做好，事故频繁，严重影响了工矿生产的正常进行，特别是重工业生产的损失更大。通报中要求全国各地电业局必须以切实负责的态度与用户密切配合，根据全国供用电会议关于统一配合检修工作的指示，做好统一配合检修工作。统一配合的原则，应当是次要服从主要，送、变、配电服从发电，轻负荷服从重负荷。不论电业局或用户，均应依据这个原则，从整体利益出发来考虑配合检修问题，不应片面地强调自己方便，只要求别的单位来配合。通报中最后指出：统一检修工作也是发挥用电潜力的重要措施之一，是加强计划管理的一件重要工作，要求各局认真检查自己的工作，并将有关统一配合检修的执行情况加以总结，以便交流经验，推动工作。
