    Investigating Consumer Needs

    To strive to meet the growing and multifaceted material needs of the people is the lofty task of state-owned commercial departments. To achieve this, it is essential to first investigate and understand the needs of the people. The cotton cloth and silk fabric variety exhibition jointly organized by the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and the Zhejiang Branch of the China Silk Company in Hangzhou provided a method for investigating consumer needs. The Zhejiang Daily provided a relatively detailed introduction to this exhibition on August 19th and published an "Economic Life Brief Commentary," believing that commodity variety exhibitions are a good way to improve the supply of goods.

    According to the Zhejiang Daily report, the cotton cloth and silk fabric variety exhibition jointly organized by the provincial cotton yarn and cloth company and the silk company to realistically organize the peak season supply displayed 155 categories and 2,880 varieties of cotton cloth and 118 categories and 1,280 varieties of silk fabric collected from various places inside and outside the province. Many people visited, including salespeople from state-owned companies and cooperatives, employees from private stores, textile workers, representatives of capitalists in relevant industries, as well as cadres from government agencies and residents. Visitors to the exhibition, on the one hand, filled out "sample selection forms" with their favorite varieties, requesting state-owned companies to purchase and supply them in large quantities; on the other hand, they put forward many specific requirements and opinions on the exhibits, such as increasing the variety of colors, improving quality, and improving dyeing. These opinions of the visitors became an important basis for state-owned commercial departments to process and purchase goods. After the exhibition, salespeople from cotton yarn and cloth companies and department stores revised their original plans based on consumer needs. The company is preparing to expand the processing and purchase of popular varieties to supply them in large quantities during the peak season. This can promote state-owned commercial departments to improve business management, strengthen the planning of work, and overcome the phenomenon of disconnection between processing, purchasing, and sales, thereby better meeting consumer needs.

    On the other hand, commodity variety exhibitions also played a role in promoting production. The Zhejiang Daily said in its report that when the same varieties of cotton cloth from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other regions were displayed together at the exhibition, cotton cloth producers in Hangzhou were seriously alarmed when they saw that many local products were not as good as those from Shanghai, and some products were even inferior to those from Wenzhou and Ningbo and were therefore not popular with the masses. Textile workers in Hangzhou put forward many ways to improve production and ensured the production of fabrics that are popular with the masses. Capitalists in the dyeing and weaving industry in Hangzhou also stated that they must actively improve product quality in the future and are prepared to establish a color variety design group to improve color varieties. This is just as Kalinin pointed out when he received Soviet consumer cooperative workers on June 22, 1939, that trade organizations can promote and stimulate industry like yeast and bacterial stimulants, so that industry produces various commodities needed by residents.

    Therefore, the Zhejiang Daily correctly pointed out in the "Economic Life Brief Commentary": "The cotton cloth and silk fabric variety exhibition held by the Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the Provincial Silk Company is a good method for investigating consumer needs, organizing the peak season supply of goods, and further implementing the state-owned commerce's service to production and consumers." Of course, this is not the only method. And the task of the newspaper lies in: promoting the excellent style of state-owned commercial departments in going deep into the masses and into the market to conduct investigations and research, striving to meet the needs of urban and rural people, and being good at playing a role as a link between consumers and producers through concrete and vivid examples; at the same time, criticizing the one-sided economic accounting thought and blind management style that does not care about people's lives and does not study people's needs.

### 调查消费者的需要

    调查消费者的需要
    努力满足人民群众日益增长的、多方面的物质需要，是国营商业部门的崇高任务。而要做到这一点，就必须首先调查和了解人民群众的需要。中国花纱布公司浙江省公司和中国蚕丝公司浙江分公司在杭州市联合举办的棉布、绸缎品种展览会，提供了一个调查消费者需要的方法。浙江日报在八月十九日对这个展览会作了比较详细的介绍，并发表“经济生活简评”，认为商品品种展览会是改善物资供应的好办法。
    据浙江日报报道，该省花纱布公司和蚕丝公司为切合实际地组织旺季供应而联合举办的棉布、绸缎品种展览会，曾陈列出从省内外各地搜集来的一百五十五类、二千八百八十种花色品种的棉布和一百十八类、一千二百八十种花色品种的绸缎。前往参观的人很多，包括国营公司和合作社的营业员、私营商店店员、纺织工人、有关行业的资方代表以及机关干部、居民等。展览会的参观者一方面将自己喜爱的花色品种填在“选样单”里，要求国营公司大量采购供应；另一方面对陈列品提出增加花色、提高质量、改进染色等许多具体要求和意见。参观者的这些意见，成了国营商业部门加工和采购商品的重要依据。花纱布公司和百货公司的营业员在展览会后，都纷纷根据消费者的需要，修订了原来的计划。群众一致欢迎的花色品种，公司正准备扩大加工和采购，以便在旺季中大量供应。这就可以促使国营商业部门改善经营管理，加强工作的计划性，克服加工采购和销售脱节的现象，从而更好地满足消费者的需要。
    在另一方面，商品品种展览会也起了推动生产的作用。浙江日报在报道中说，展览会将上海、杭州及其他地区相同品种的棉布陈列在一起，当杭州市的棉布生产者看到当地许多产品不及上海货，某些产品甚至赶不上温州货和宁波货因而不受群众欢迎时，都引起了严重的警惕。杭州市的纺织工人们，提出了许多改进生产的办法，保证生产出为群众喜爱的织物。杭州市染织布业资方，也表示以后一定要积极提高产品质量，并准备成立花色品种设计小组，来改进花色品种。这就正如加里宁在一九三九年六月二十二日招待苏联消费合作社工作人员时所指出的，贸易机构可以像酵母和细菌兴奋剂那样来推动和刺激工业，使工业生产出各式各样为居民所需要的商品。
    因此，浙江日报在“经济生活简评”中正确地指出：“省花纱布公司和省蚕丝公司举办的棉布绸缎品种展览会，是调查消费者需要，组织旺季物资供应，进一步贯彻国营商业为生产、为消费者服务的好的方法之一。”当然，这并不是唯一的方法。而报纸的任务就在于：通过具体生动的事例来发扬国营商业部门深入群众深入市场调查研究，力求满足城乡人民的需要，并善于在消费者与生产者之间发挥纽带作用的优良作风；同时批判那种不关心人民生活、不研究人民需要的片面经济核算思想和盲目经营的作风。
