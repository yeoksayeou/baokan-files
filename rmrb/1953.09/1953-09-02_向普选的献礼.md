    The rainy weather in July and August brought many difficulties to the textile workers: more thread breaks, making the work harder. However, the workers of the Tianjin Private Hengyuan Textile Factory overcame these difficulties. They said, "Celebrating the great event of universal suffrage means even the greatest difficulties can be overcome!" More than two thousand workers have a common aspiration: to celebrate their first enjoyment of electoral rights with new labor achievements. Now, more than nine hundred workers throughout the factory are enthusiastically participating in the universal suffrage propaganda work; one hundred and thirty groups have all formulated production plans to welcome universal suffrage as a gift to universal suffrage.

    Before liberation, the workers of the Hengyuan Textile Factory had waged heroic struggles to win democratic rights. Qi Yingcai, the current chairman of the labor union and a veteran worker, still remembers the great strike of 1946. At that time, Kuomintang military police and secret agents surrounded the factory, attacked the unarmed workers, imprisoned them, and insulted and tortured them. After liberation, the workers had their own labor union organization, abolished the humiliating body search system, and, through the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the democratic reform movement, fought against the feudal foremen who rode on the workers' heads. Over the past four years, with the support of the People's Government, the factory has developed greatly. The number of workers has more than doubled. Compared with the early days of liberation, the current output of cotton yarn has increased by 54%; cotton cloth has increased by 151%, and it has won the title of First-Class Model Factory. With the development of production, the lives of the workers have also improved. Current wages are more than 20% higher than in the early days of liberation. The factory also has workers' spare-time schools, employee sanatoriums, and nurseries. Qi Yingcai said with emotion about this stark contrast: "When I think of the suffering of the workers before liberation, the lack of democratic freedom, I feel even more the preciousness of today's democracy and the loveliness of the new society."

    The workers' love for the right to vote is fully demonstrated in their labor. From the opening and cleaning workshop to the packaging workshop, the workers are working hard and happily. After setting a production plan to welcome universal suffrage, Yao Shuhua, a female spinner, discussed with Zhang Shuzhen, who shared a spinning machine with her: "In order to complete the production plan to welcome universal suffrage, can we guarantee that the waste cotton will not exceed 37.5 ounces?" Zhang Shuzhen immediately replied excitedly: "Yes! Let's challenge other mutual aid groups and compete!" In this way, a heated production competition was launched throughout the group. Yao Shuhua has not produced a single bad yarn in the past twenty days. Fang Shuqin, a female weaver, used to produce more than 52 bad yarns every day, failing to complete her plan. After accepting Yao Shuhua's experience, she now only produces two bad yarns a day. Wang Shuzhen, a spinner, did not implement the Hao Jianxiu work method well in the past, and produced a lot of waste cotton. She received a great education in this universal suffrage movement. She proposed: "I must show the attitude of being the master of my own house and do a good job in production." When formulating the group plan, she set the waste cotton at only 42 ounces per day (the administrative plan was 47 ounces). In order to complete the production plan, she ran to the workshop to wipe the machines before going to work every day. Now, Wang Shuzhen has managed to produce only 32 ounces of waste cotton a day.

    In the weaving workshop, the excellent results shown by the weavers in the upsurge of welcoming universal suffrage can also be seen from the group production record boards in the workshop. Zhang Qingyu's group overfulfilled more than 300 yards of cloth in July; the rate of first-grade cloth exceeded the plan by more than 1.5%; and the attendance rate also reached 100%. The output of yarn and cloth in the whole factory increased rapidly. According to statistics from August 1st to 12th, the average output of cotton yarn completed 101.85% of the plan; cotton cloth completed 102.44%.

    Recently, the workers have received their voter registration cards. Yu Shaozhen, a female spinner, said excitedly: "In 1950, our labor union chairman, Qi Yingcai, became a representative of the district's people from all walks of life. How could such a thing have happened in the past? In the future, we will also elect our own representatives to manage the affairs of the country, build the country stronger, and our lives will be better." The workers who received their voter registration cards, like Yu Shaozhen, could not hide their happy mood. They gathered in groups of three or five to look at them, laughing and talking, and a kind of seemingly inexpressible smile was revealed on every young, happy face.

    向普选的献礼
    新华社记者  朱泽民  戚庆莲
    七、八月的雨天给纺织工人们带来了很多工作上的困难：断头多，活不好做。但是，天津私营恒源纺织厂的工人们却战胜了这些困难。他们说：“庆祝普选大喜事，就是再大的困难也可以克服！”两千多工人都有一个共同的心愿：要用自己新的劳动成就来庆贺第一次享受到的选举权利。现在，全厂九百多工人热情地参加了普选宣传工作；一百三十个小组都订出了迎接普选的生产计划，作为向普选的献礼。
    恒源纺织厂的工人，在解放前，曾经为争取民主权利进行过英勇的斗争。现任工会主席、老工人齐英才还记得一九四六年那一次大罢工。当时，国民党的宪兵、特务包围了工厂，向手无寸铁的工人进攻，把工人都禁闭起来，侮辱和拷打工人。解放后，工人们有了自己的工会组织，取消了侮辱人权的搜身制；经过镇压反革命和民主改革运动，斗争了骑在工人头上的封建把头。四年多来，在人民政府扶助下，工厂有了很大发展，工人增加了一倍多，现在的产量和解放初期比较，棉纱增加了百分之五十四；棉布增加了百分之一百五十一，并曾经获得一等模范工厂的称号。随着生产的发展，工人的生活也得到改善。现在的工资比解放初期增加了百分之二十多，工厂里还设有工人业余学校、职工疗养院和托儿所。齐英才为这鲜明的对比而感动地说：“想起解放前工人受压迫，没有民主自由的痛苦，就越发感觉到今天民主的可贵，新社会的可爱。”
    工人们对选举权利的热爱从劳动中充分地表现出来。从清花车间到成包车间，工人们紧张而愉快地劳动着。细纱女工姚淑华在订了迎接普选的生产计划以后，就和同她合看一台细纱机的张淑珍商量：“咱们为了要完成迎接普选的生产计划，保证回花不超过三十七点五个盎司，行吗？”张淑珍马上兴奋地回答：“行！咱们再向别的互助组挑战，比赛一下！”就这样，全组展开了热烈的生产竞赛。姚淑华在最近二十多天里，没有出一个坏纱。挡车女工方淑琴每天出坏纱到过五十二个，没完成计划，她接受了姚淑华的经验后，现在，一天只出两个坏纱。细纱工人王淑珍过去对郝建秀工作法执行得不好，回花出的很多；她在这次普选运动中受到很大教育，她提出：“我一定要拿出当家做主的样子来，把生产搞好。”在制订小组计划时，她把回花订到每天只出四十二个盎司（行政计划是四十七个盎司）。为了完成生产计划，她每天上班前就跑到车间去擦机器。现在，王淑珍已做到一天只出回花三十二个盎司了。
    在织布车间，从车间里的小组生产记录牌上，也可以看出织布工人在迎接普选的热潮中所表现出来的优良成绩。张庆玉小组七月份超额完成三百多码布；正布率超过计划百分之一点五多；出勤率也达到百分之百。全厂纱、布产量迅速提高，据八月一日到十二日的统计，棉纱的平均产量完成了计划的百分之一百零一点八五；棉布完成百分之一百零二点四四。
    最近工人们都领到了选民证。细纱女工于绍珍兴奋地说：“一九五○年，我们的工会主席齐英才当了区各界人民代表会议的代表，这种事过去那有？以后，咱们还要选举自己的代表去管理国家大事，把国家建设得更强大，咱们的生活也就过得更好了。”拿到了选民证的工人们，和于绍珍一样，都掩饰不住他们愉快的心情，三五成群地围着看，欢笑和谈论着，在每一个年青的、幸福的脸上都流露着一种似乎是难以表达的笑容。
