    Responding to the Party and Government's Call to Further Develop Agriculture
    A Large Number of Soviet Technical Cadres Take Up Rural Work Positions
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] Soviet workers and technicians in various cities are responding to the call of the Communist Party and the government to equip machine tractor stations with sufficient skilled technical cadres, and are flocking to rural work positions. According to the Truth Daily: Many technicians in the Ural industrial area have submitted applications to work at machine tractor stations. In Chelyabinsk, within a few days, seventy skilled engineers were permitted to work at machine tractor stations. The Stalingrad Oblast will, in the near future, send one hundred experts to the countryside to serve as directors of machine tractor stations, one hundred and fifty experts as chief engineers, and two hundred and fifty experts as mechanics and technicians. The Oblast is also preparing to send two thousand tractor drivers, combine harvester operators, lathe operators, blacksmiths, fitters, etc., to the countryside to meet the needs of developing the agricultural economy. Many technicians from the Stalingrad Tractor Factory have already gone to the countryside to participate in new work positions and have begun to bring a new atmosphere to the machine tractor stations. For example, Peter Liangkov, the chief engineer of the factory's workshop, immediately applied to go to the countryside after the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party was promulgated, and served as the director of the Gorlo-Banarye Machine Tractor Station. After studying the reasons for the backwardness of this machine tractor station, he has formulated a preliminary plan to increase equipment, train tractor drivers, and maximize the efficiency of the machines.
    Moscow newspapers have been publishing news and applications from many workers and engineering technicians across the country who are requesting to work in the countryside. Vladkin, the director of the mechanical workshop of the Lisenko Machine Factory, wrote: "Difficult but glorious work lies ahead of me. I will contribute all my experience to it. Today, for me, the high tide of agricultural economy is the most urgent and important thing." A female staff member of the Irkutsk District Agricultural Administration wrote: "When the people of the entire Soviet Union are making every effort to improve agriculture, one cannot stand idly by. I hope to work in a machine tractor station according to my specialty."

    响应党和政府进一步发展农业的号召
    苏联大批技术干部走上农村工作岗位
    【新华社莫斯科二十三日电】苏联各城市的工人和技术人员，正在响应共产党和政府关于给机器拖拉机站配备充足的熟练技术干部的号召，纷纷走向农村工作岗位。据真理报报道：乌拉尔工业区域的许多技术人员已提出了要到机器拖拉机站工作的申请书。车里雅宾斯克市在短短的数天内，已有七十个熟练的工程师获得允许，到机器拖拉机站去工作。斯大林格勒州将在最近期间内，派遣一百个专家到农村担任机器拖拉机站站长，一百五十个专家担任总工程师，二百五十个专家担任机械师和技师。该州还准备把二千个拖拉机手、收割联合机手、镟工、锻工、钳工等派到农村去，以应发展农业经济的需要。斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂已有许多技术人员到农村参加了新的工作岗位，并开始给机器拖拉机站带来了新的气象。例如该厂车间总工程师彼得梁科夫在苏联共产党中央全会决议颁布后，立即申请下乡，担任了果尔洛·巴纳列耶机器拖拉机站站长。他在研究了这个机器拖拉机站落后的原因后，已拟出了增加设备、训练拖拉机手和发挥机器效能的初步计划。
    莫斯科各报连日刊载了全国各地许多工人和工程技术人员请求到农村工作的消息和申请书。利森城机器制造厂机械车间主任甫拉德金写道：“在我的前面摆着艰难的但是光荣的工作。我将为它贡献出自己全部的经验。今天对我说来，农业经济的高涨乃是最迫近和最重要的事情。”伊尔库茨克区农业管理局一位女工作人员写道：“当全苏联人民正在全力提高农业的时候，不能袖手旁观。我希望能按照自己的专长到机器拖拉机站去工作。”
