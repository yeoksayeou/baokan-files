    New Achievements in Czechoslovak Literature
    Zhu Ziqi
    On the Czechoslovak literary front, new and brilliant achievements have emerged, namely the seven outstanding literary works that won the 1953 "National Prize."
    At the "National Prize" award ceremony held in Prague in early May this year, Czechoslovak Prime Minister Široký, in his speech, called these award-winning works major gains made by the Czechoslovak working people in the field of literature and art in the recent period, and a victory for the Party and Gottwald's literary and artistic policies. He said: "We always believe that artistic creation constantly fulfills its important mission in the cause of building a socialist society... Here, before the 'engineers of human souls,' a broad scope of creative activities has been opened up. Our workers are eager to read works that clearly reflect their wholehearted creation of a new life, their thoughts and aspirations, and their enormous energy in fighting stubbornly against difficulties and shortcomings. Art has become a cause that is closely related to the broad masses of the people."
    Maria Pujmanová, a prominent contemporary female writer and poet, won the first prize of the "National Prize" for her new work "Life Against Death". This novel truthfully and profoundly portrays the struggle of the Czechoslovak people against the German fascist bandits in the darkest and most terrifying years of history, as well as the vivid scenes of their friendship and gratitude to their liberator, the glorious Soviet Red Army. The story of the novel unfolds in the Georgian Republic of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovak textile engineer Urba meets Gido, an enthusiastic and capable Georgian agricultural technician there. Several years later, they meet again in Prague, which has been liberated from gold. The author not only generally writes about the Czech people’s friendship with the Soviet Union, and clarifies the importance and victorious future of this friendship, but also shapes outstanding and immortal artistic images in this regard through typical characterization. She foresees that this fraternal friendship will be given higher and broader development in the post-war future, when the Czech working people devote themselves to building socialism.
    A large part of the novel is devoted to the direct struggle of the Czechoslovak people against Nazi bandits and traitors, which is closely linked to this friendship. Whether in Hitler's concentration camps, prisons, and gallows, whether in factories, workshops, schools, and homes, whether in guerrilla units and in the Czechoslovak divisions established with Soviet assistance, battles are fought and heroic deeds occur. "Life and Death Fight" is considered the most successful masterpiece, as it comprehensively, vividly, and faithfully depicts the Czechoslovak people’s struggle against the German aggressors.
    In a recent article, "How I Wrote 'Life Against Death'?", the author wrote: "I finished 'Life and Death Fight' with love and excitement. Yes, in the past, when a writer conceived a subject and did not write it, it seemed that it was still a personal matter. But our era is different. We have a responsibility to complete the subjects that should be expressed, and any excuse is inconceivable. Our people's open or covert struggle against the plunderers, the great role played by the Communist Party in this national struggle, the Soviet Union's victorious struggle, and the indescribable feeling of happiness of our nation after being liberated, all belong not only to myself, but also to the subjects of concern of our entire society. It belongs to the people and the collective."
    "Life and Death Fight" is the last part of Maria Pujmanová's monumental historical trilogy. The first part is "People at the Crossroads", which mainly describes the tragic life and political awakening of the people during the chaotic period of the bourgeois republic, and exposes the true situation of the sinful rule of the bourgeois republic before the Munich Conference. The second part is "Playing with Fire", which begins with Hitler's rise to power. The heroic image of the great international proletarian fighter Dimitrov in the Leipzig court and the description of Prague during those tragic days of the Munich incident are very profound and successful. The famous Czechoslovak critic Libak wrote: "'Playing with Fire' is the best work of modern Czech prose and a great success of socialist realism. Like Fučík's 'Notes from the Gallows,' it is permeated with faith and loyalty to socialism."
    Maria Pujmanová's trilogy faithfully and accurately analyzes an important stage in Czechoslovak history. The stories and characters in the trilogy are closely linked to the historical events of this period. The editorial of "Red Rights News" called this masterpiece "the history of the Czechoslovak people's struggle in the past decade."
    Jan Drda, another famous Czechoslovak novelist and playwright, also won the first prize of the "National Prize" for his novella "The Red Torczyca". In a short space, the author fully and completely narrates the events that occurred before and after the victory in 1945. Readers can hear the last roar of the German fascist beasts before their death, the victorious footsteps of the advancing Soviet Red Army, and the cheers of the Czechoslovak people for their new life and liberation. The special success of this novel lies in the profound and appropriate creation of the peasant type. One of the protagonists of the novel, a young peasant, personally experienced the exploitation of the landlords, and saw the arrival of a new life with his own eyes. He came into contact with Communists and Soviets. He worked and thought, and became an ideal and conscious peasant, understanding that the socialist future was his only beautiful future. This is also the destiny of the entire Czechoslovak peasantry.
    The other two novels that won the "National Prize" are Adolf Branald's "Bread and Song" and Sedláček's "Louisiana Awakens". The former mainly describes the Czechoslovak workers' movement from the 1870s to the 1890s, when the laborers gradually awakened and organized themselves in the education of real life to fight for their rights. Through the various behind-the-scenes activities of a group of large industrial and commercial capitalists at that time, the author delicately and concentratedly exposed the essence of their exploitation and harm to the working masses. The latter positively depicts new people with socialist ideological qualities. The author is very familiar with the miners in northern Czech. He persuasively portrays the victorious struggle of advanced workers under the leadership of the Party against difficulties in work, selfishness and laziness in thought, and internal saboteurs. "Red Rights News" commented: "The achievements they have made in creating the image of workers show the victory of the creative path chosen by the writer and a valuable contribution to our new literary cause."
    The poem that won the first prize of the "National Prize" is the collection of poems "Wings" by the famous poet Vítězslav Nezval, which sings the praises of the motherland. This is a selection of the author's poetry from 1949 to 1952. This period was the period after the February Revolution, when the bourgeoisie was completely defeated politically and socialism was comprehensively built, and was the "most beautiful period" in Czechoslovak history. The poet uses infinite joy and full emotions to praise these changes and victories. The poet’s rich imagination and expressiveness, and the beauty and simplicity of the verses, are inseparable from the excellent traditions of his nation’s ancient literature and folk poetry. In this regard, Nezval’s poetry has reached a mature stage. His poems have enriched and improved Czechoslovak modern poetry in all aspects.
    Nezval is a prolific writer. He has written many famous poems and some movie scripts and novels. Among them, poems such as "Song of Peace", which recently won the Peace Gold Medal awarded by the World Peace Council (the poem has won the Czechoslovak Peace Prize), and the long poems "Ode to Stalin", "Motherland", "Shadow of History", etc., are all familiar and loved by the broad Czechoslovak readers.
    The works "My Noon" and "Singing Heart" by two young Slovak poets, Vojtech Mihálik and Pavol Horov, also won the "National Prize". These two talented new poets are the flowers representing the flourishing period of Slovak poetry today. Mihálik's poems have a strong combativeness and a clear melody, and the language is also novel and easy to understand. Because he has been enthusiastically participating in various practical struggles, closely following the footsteps of the Slovak working people, his poems are closely combined with the current national and party policies, and he gloriously won the title of "Socialist Inspirer". Horov skillfully mastered the characteristics of the Slovak epic and developed the beautiful poetic drama of folk ballad style. Most of his poems can be sung or set to music.
    These new literary achievements have received high attention and encouragement from the government, and have been warmly supported and respected by the broad masses of the society. Many factories, schools, institutions, and rural areas have held congratulatory meetings for the winners or discussion meetings on the award-winning works. The writers themselves often regard participating in these meetings as a good opportunity for education. The award-winning works are also welcomed by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    Judging from the achievements of these excellent works that have won the "National Prize", they will play a major exemplary role in solving several problems existing in the current Czechoslovak literary creation. The main problems are:
    (1) The issue of expressing historical themes. Some writers believe that a certain degree of ideological height can be achieved in creating contemporary realistic themes, but if they turn around to deal with historical themes, they will definitely reduce their ideological content. Some writers even think that this is a phenomenon of escaping from reality. However, Pujmanová's monumental trilogy, which mainly depicts the history of the bourgeois republic, Branald's "Bread and Song", which writes about the rise and fall of capitalism, and President Zapotocky's brilliant masterpiece "The New Soldiers Stand Up", which reflects the history of the development of the workers' movement, have all powerfully refuted this erroneous argument. Reality and history cannot be separated. The question is how to correctly understand and faithfully express it. In fact, good literary works write about the past, which must be "developed today and helpful to today" (Gottwald's words). "New Literature News" pointed out: "Literary artists should point out the way forward in their works. But for this, he must pay attention to the past, pay attention to history, and describe how our people used to live, work, and fight."
    (2) The issue of writing about rural life. In recent years, the broad masses of Czechoslovak readers have generally demanded that writers create works that reflect rural life. Jan Drda’s works and Geczy's novel "Wooden Village" portrayed the image of the new agricultural laborers and described the new rural areas after the fierce socialist reform, giving the readers satisfactory answers. Critics reviewed the errors in this regard: in the past, some writers’ reflections on the decisive key to agricultural issues—how to establish unified agricultural cooperatives—were underestimated, thereby reducing the valuable contributions made by writers to the new theme of literary creation. The urgent task now facing writers is how to profoundly reflect the tense struggle of agricultural cooperatives, which affects the entire social life, to improve the quality of work, including how to overcome selfish and conservative ideas about collective labor and common property, and how to overcome technical and organizational difficulties caused by changes in production relations.
    (3) The issue of opposing formalistic creative methods. This is manifested in the works avoiding complex problems in life and the tortuous process of the development of things, writing the stories in a straight line without conflict or change in violation of the truth, and writing affirmative characters, the images of communists, their character, ideological level, and even their interests and hobbies uniformly like crafts from the same model. The Czechoslovak literary and art circles particularly criticized the writer Kubka's novel "Prague Spring". The author unpersuasively and blandly narrates the process of a group of active Youth League members turning a bad factory into an advanced enterprise. This has to distort the life and characters that the author subjectively intended to praise. However, the "National Prize" award-winning works successfully reflected diverse and rich lives and created distinct typical characters. For example, in Pujmanová's "Life and Death Fight", the images and personalities of the three women are completely different: one is the firm and capable female Bolshevik Gido, one is the enthusiastic and active Adelgeya, and the other is the steady and meticulous female doctor Skrshvakova. These beautiful and vivid images give people unforgettable memories, also because they are closely linked to the complex life and the background of their times.
    (4) The issue of opposing the remnants of cosmopolitanism in literary thought. Although after the February Revolution in 1948, after the "Grand Review of Cultural Heritage" personally launched by Comrade Gottwald and a large-scale and comprehensive study of the Soviet Union, especially the recognition of their own nation's progressive heritage, the Czechoslovak classical writers such as Alois Jirasek had been given appropriate evaluations, the influence of cosmopolitanism was basically defeated. However, remnants still exist, such as the lack of emphasis on the study of classical literature and folk literature. Undoubtedly, the "National Prize" award-winning works are examples of accepting the national literary heritage, especially the poems written by Nezval and the two young Slovak poets with a strong lyrical ballad style and beautiful and perfect forms, which have achieved new achievements in inheriting the excellent national literary heritage of their country.
    In front of the Czechoslovak writers, there is an excellent tradition of national literature inherited and developed by great writers of all ages. The names of these writers include: Olbracht, the author of "Anna the Proletarian", Fučík, the author of "Notes from the Gallows", Majerová, the author of "The Siren", Pujmanová, the author of "Life and Death Fight", Vančura, Kratochvíl, Nový, Kráčalová, and others. Some of these representatives of Czechoslovak socialist realism literature are still leading the younger generation of writers to work together to create works that express completely new themes. At the same time, the Czechoslovak literary circles also put forward the issue of restoring the Fučík tradition, and mobilized writers to write more essays, sketches, and reportage for newspapers and magazines. The achievements made by the new sketch writer Grasalo in this regard have been praised by the Writers Association. In addition, the Writers Association called on writers to write scripts for movies, create lyrics for music, and write readings for children in simple national language.
    Many brilliant works by Soviet writers have also deeply influenced and educated Czechoslovak writers. An editorial in "New Literature News" wrote: "It is fully justified to draw a conclusion that Soviet literature has become an indispensable factor for every one of our writers to move forward." Maria Pujmanová once said that one of the important reasons why she was able to become a writer was the enlightenment given to her by Soviet literary works. The Czechoslovak Writers Association will soon convene a national conference of writers and literary workers. At this meeting, it will summarize the gains in literary creation since the establishment of the Writers Association in 1949, and stipulate the guidelines for further development of the literary cause in the future. When reviewing their works, the writers will deeply recall the words of Comrade Gottwald, the leader of writers and the people, whose name is inseparable from the development of the new Czechoslovak literary cause: "Do not deceive those who place their hopes on you: be the engineers of our people's souls, be the mouthpiece for expressing his ideals, his love and hatred, and be his socialist inspirer!"

    捷克斯洛伐克文学的新成就
    朱子奇
    在捷克斯洛伐克文学战线上，出现了新的辉煌成就，这就是荣获一九五三年度“国家奖金”的七部优秀文学作品。
    今年五月初在布拉格举行的“国家奖金”授奖典礼大会上，捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理西罗基在讲话中，称这些得奖作品为捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民最近期间，在文学艺术事业方面的重大收获，是党和哥特瓦尔德文艺政策的胜利。他说：“我们永远相信：艺术创作不断完成自己在建设社会主义社会事业中的重要使命……在这里，在‘人类灵魂工程师’面前，开辟了广阔的创作活动范围。我们的劳动者热望读到明显地反映他们一心创造新生活、他们的思想与愿望、他们和困难与缺点进行顽强斗争的巨大精力的作品。艺术已成为与广大人民群众有血肉关系的事业了。”
    当代杰出的女作家、女诗人玛丽亚·布依曼诺娃的新作“生与死的搏斗”荣获“国家奖金”一等奖。这部小说真实而深刻地刻划了捷克斯洛伐克人民在历史上最黑暗与恐怖的年代反抗德国法西斯强盗的斗争及对自己的解放者，光荣的苏联红军的友谊与感激的生动场面。小说的故事，展开于苏联格鲁吉亚共和国。捷克斯洛伐克纺织工程师乌尔巴，在那里认识了一位热情而能干的格鲁吉亚农业技师吉多。相隔了若干年，他们在被解放了的黄金的布拉格又相见了。作者不仅一般地写出了捷克人民对苏联的友谊，阐明了这种友谊的重要及胜利的前途，而且通过典型的人物塑造了在这方面凸出的不朽的艺术形象，她预见了这种兄弟的友谊在战后的未来的日子里，在捷克劳动人民奋身建设社会主义的时候，将得到更高、更广阔的发展。
    小说以很大的部分描写与这种友谊紧密相联的捷克斯洛伐克人民反对纳粹匪徒及卖国贼的正面斗争。无论在希特勒的集中营、狱牢和绞杀台上，无论在工厂作坊、学校和家庭里，无论在游击队及在由苏联帮助成立的捷克斯洛伐克师团军队中，战斗进行着，英雄事迹发生着。这样全面而又生动和忠实地描绘捷克斯洛伐克人民反对德国侵略者的斗争的小说，“生与死的搏斗”被认为是最成功的代表作。
    作者在最近一篇“我怎样写‘生与死的搏斗’的？”文章中写道：“我以充满热爱和激动的心情写完‘生与死的搏斗’。是的，在过去的时代，当一个作家构思好一个题材而未写成时，看来，这似乎毕竟是他个人的事。但我们这个时代就不同了，我们有责任把应该表现的题材完成，任何藉口都是不可思议的。我们的人民对掠夺者进行公开或隐蔽的斗争，共产党在这个全民斗争中所起的伟大的作用，苏联的胜利斗争，我们的民族因得到解放的那种难于表现的幸福的感情，这一切都不仅属于我自己，而是我们整个社会所关怀的题材，它属于人民和集体。”
    “生与死的搏斗”是玛丽亚·布依曼诺娃的历史巨著纪念碑式的三部曲的最后一部。第一部是“在十字路口的人们”，主要是描写在资产阶级共和国混乱时期，人民的生活惨景和政治觉醒，并暴露了在慕尼黑会议以前资产阶级共和国罪恶统治的真实情况。第二部是“玩火”，以希特勒上台为小说的开端，对于伟大国际无产阶级战士季米特洛夫在莱比锡法庭上的英雄形象和对慕尼黑事件那些悲惨的日子中的布拉格的描写，都是非常深刻和成功的。捷克斯洛伐克著名评论家利巴克写道：“‘玩火’是现代捷克散文中最优秀的作品，是社会主义现实主义一个伟大的成功。它和伏契克的‘绞刑架下的报告’同样地浸透了对社会主义的信念和忠诚。”
    玛丽亚·布依曼诺娃的三部曲，忠实而确切地剖析了捷克斯洛伐克历史上的一个重要的阶段。三部曲中的故事和人物，前后紧紧贯穿着这一时期的历史事件。“红色权利报”的社论称这部巨作为“捷克斯洛伐克人民近十年斗争史。”
    捷克斯洛伐克另一位著名的小说家兼剧作家扬·德尔达的中篇“红色的托尔季查”，也是今年得“国家奖金”一等奖的作品之一。作者以不长的篇幅充分而完善地叙述了一九四五年胜利前后所发生的事件。读者可以从中听到德国法西斯野兽在死亡前的最后吼叫声和前进中的苏联红军胜利的步伐声，以及捷克斯洛伐克人民为自己的新生与解放的欢呼声。这部小说特别成功的地方，是深刻而恰当地创造了农民的典型。小说主人翁之一的青年农民，亲身经历了地主的剥削，又亲眼看见新的生活的到来，他接触了共产党人和苏联人，他劳动着，思索着，他成为一个有理想的觉悟了的农民，而懂得了社会主义的未来是他的唯一的美好的前途。这也就是整个捷克斯洛伐克农民的命运。
    其他两篇得“国家奖金”的小说，是阿多尔夫·布朗纳尔德的“面包与歌”及塞德拉契克的“路易斯安那觉醒了”。前者主要描写十九世纪七十年代至九十年代捷克斯洛伐克的工人运动，劳动者在现实生活的教育中，渐渐觉醒和组织起来为争自己的权利而斗争。作者通过当时一群大工商业资本家的种种内幕的活动，细腻而又集中地暴露了他们剥削和危害工人群众的本质。后者正面描写具有社会主义思想品质的新人。作者非常熟悉捷克北部的矿工，他富有说服力地描绘出先进工人在党的领导下，和工作中的困难、思想中的自私与懒惰以及内部的破坏分子进行的胜利的斗争。“红色权利报”评论道：“他们创造工人形象所达到的成就，是显示出作家选择的创作道路的胜利，是对我们新文学事业的有价值的贡献。”
    荣获“国家奖金”一等奖的诗，是著名诗人维台兹斯拉夫·湼兹瓦尔歌颂祖国的诗集“翅膀”。这是作者一九四九年至一九五二年诗创作的选集。这个时期是二月革命后，从政治上彻底打败了资产阶级和全面建设社会主义的时期，是捷克斯洛伐克过去历史上“最美丽的时期”。诗人以无限的欢欣与饱满的情绪来赞美这些变化和胜利。诗人想像力与表现力的丰富和诗句的优美与纯朴，都和自己民族的古代文学及民间诗歌的优良传统分不开的，在这方面湼兹瓦尔的诗达到了成熟的阶段，他的诗从各个方面充实了和提高了捷克斯洛伐克的现代诗歌。
    湼兹瓦尔是多产作家，他写了许多首著名的诗和一些电影剧本和小说。其中如最近荣获世界和平理事会所颁布的和平金质奖章的诗“和平之歌”
    （该诗曾得捷克斯洛伐克和平奖金），和长诗“斯大林颂”、“祖国”、“历史的影子”等，都是广大捷克斯洛伐克读者所熟悉与喜爱的诗篇。
    斯洛伐克的两位青年诗人伏兹台赫·米加利克和巴夫罗·高罗夫的作品“我的晌午”与“歌唱着的心”，也荣获了“国家奖金”。这两位有天才的新诗人，是代表现在斯洛伐克诗歌的繁荣时期的花朵。米加利克的诗，具有强烈的战斗性与明朗的旋律性，语言也新颖平易。由于他一直热心参加各种实际斗争，紧紧跟随着斯洛伐克劳动人民前进的脚步，就使得自己的诗作密切地结合着当前国家和党的政策，而光荣地获得了“社会主义鼓舞者”的称号。高罗夫很熟练地掌握了斯洛伐克的史诗的特点，发展了民间歌谣体的优美的诗剧。他的诗大部分都能唱或谱成歌。
    这些文学的新成就，得到政府高度的重视与鼓励，受到社会广大群众的热烈拥护与尊敬。许多工厂学校和机关及农村，都举行祝贺得奖者会议或得奖作品讨论会等，作家本人常常把参加这些会当作受教育的好机会。得奖作品同样受到苏联及人民民主国家的欢迎。
    从这几部得“国家奖金”的优秀作品所达到的成就上看，对解决目前捷克斯洛伐克文学创作上存在的几个问题，将起重大的范例作用。这几个问题主要是：
    （一）表现历史题材问题。有些作家认为在创作当代的现实题材中还可以达到思想性的一定的高度，但如回过头去处理历史题材，就必定会降低思想性，有的作家甚至认为这是一种逃避现实的现象。但，以描写资产阶级共和国历史为主的布依曼诺娃巨作三部曲、写资本主义的兴起和灭亡的布朗纳尔德的“面包与歌”以及萨波托斯基总统反映工人运动发展史的光辉巨作“新战士站起来”等等成功作品，都有力地驳斥了这种错误的论调。现实和历史不能分开，问题是如何正确地认识与忠实地表现它。实际上好的文学作品所写的过去，必定是“发展于今天，有助于今天”（哥特瓦尔德语）。“新文学报”指出：“文学家应在作品中指出前进的路。但为此，他就必须注意过去，注意历史，描写出我们的人民曾经怎样生活过、劳动过和战斗过。”
    （二）写农村生活问题。近年来，捷克斯洛伐克广大读者群众普遍要求作家创作反映农村生活的作品。扬·德尔达的作品及格契戈的小说“木村”所刻画出的新农业劳动者的形象和描写因进行了猛烈的社会主义改革后的新农村的面貌，给了读者满意的回答。批评家检讨了在这方面的错误：过去对
    一些作家反映农业问题上决定性的关键—如何建立统一农业合作社的小说估价不足，因而降低了作家在文学创作全新主题上所努力作出的有价值的贡献。现在摆在作家面前的紧迫任务是：如何深刻反映出影响整个社会生活的农业合作社在为提高工作质量所进行的紧张的斗争，其中包括如何克服对待集体劳动和共同财产的自私与保守的思想，以及克服因生产关系的改变而引起的技术上与组织上的困难等问题。
    （三）反对公式主义的创作方法问题。这表现在作品中回避生活中复杂的问题和事物发展的曲折过程，既无冲突也无变化地把故事违反真实地写成直线的发展，和千篇一律地把肯定人物、把共产党员的形象、性格、思想水平、甚至兴趣和爱好都写成像出自同一模型的工艺品一样。捷克斯洛伐克文艺界特别批评了作家古波克的小说“布拉格之春”。作者毫无说服力地平淡乏味地叙述了一群积极的青年团员把一个不好的工厂变为先进企业的经过。这样就不得不歪曲作者所主观企图歌颂的生活和人物。而“国家奖金”得奖作品，则成功地反映了多样的丰富的生活与创造了显明的典型人物。如布依曼诺娃在“生与死的搏斗”中，三个妇女的形象和性格是完全不同：一个是坚定而能干的女布尔什维克吉多，一个是热情积极的阿德尔热亚，而另一个是稳重又细致的斯克尔史瓦可娃女医生。这些美丽的活生生的形象给人难忘的记忆，还因为他们与复杂的生活及自己的时代背景紧密地相联着的。
    （四）反对文学思想中世界主义的残余问题。虽然在一九四八年二月革命后，经过哥特瓦尔德同志亲自发动的“文化遗产大检阅”和大量地全面地学习苏联，尤其是对接受自己民族进步遗产的捷克斯洛伐克古典大作家如亚洛依斯·伊拉塞克等人的生平著作得出了公认的适当的评价，世界主义的影响基本上被打垮了。但是残余仍然存在，如表现在不重视对古典文学与民间文学的学习上。无疑的，
    “国家奖金”得奖作品是接受民族文学遗产的榜样，特别是湼兹瓦尔和斯洛伐克的两位青年诗人所写的具有浓厚的抒情歌谣风格及优美而完善的形式的诗篇，在继承本国优秀的民族文学遗产上达到了新的成就。
    在捷克斯洛伐克作家们面前，有着由历代伟大的文学家所继承和发展着的民族文学的优秀传统。这些文学家的名字，较近的就有：“女无产者—安娜”作者奥利布拉赫特、“绞刑架下的报告”作者伏契克、“汽笛”作者玛耶洛娃、“生与死的搏斗”作者布依曼诺娃以及瓦农拉、克拉多赫维尔、诺维伊、克拉查洛娃等。这些捷克斯洛伐克社会主义现实主义文学的代表人物，有好些还正在领导青年一代的作家为创作表现全新主题的作品而共同努力。同时，捷克斯洛伐克文学界还提出了恢复伏契克传统问题，动员作家为报纸杂志多写杂文、小品文和报告文学。新起的小品文作家格拉沙洛在这方面所达到的成就，受到作家协会组织的表扬。另外，作家协会号召作家们为电影编写脚本为音乐创作歌词以及用朴素的民族语言为儿童写作读物。
    苏联作家的许多光辉的作品，也深深地影响和教育着捷克斯洛伐克作家。“新文学报”社论写道：“完全有理由地得出一条结论：苏联文学成为了我们每个作家前进中不可缺少的因素。”玛丽亚·布依曼诺娃曾说过，她能成为一个作家，苏联文学作品给她的启示是重要原因之一。捷克斯洛伐克作家协会不久将召开全国作家及文学工作者大会，在这会上，将总结一九四九年作家协会成立以来文学创作上的收获，以及规定今后进一步发展文学事业的方针。作家们在检阅自己的作品时，都要深深地回忆和捷克斯洛伐克新文学事业发展分不开的名字—作家和人民的领袖哥特瓦尔德同志的话：“不要欺骗把希望寄托于你的人：要成为我们人民的灵魂工程师，成为表达他的理想、他的爱与恨的喉舌，成为他的社会主义的鼓舞者！”
