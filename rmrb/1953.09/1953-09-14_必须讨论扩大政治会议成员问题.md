The result of the United Nations Seventh General Assembly's discussion on the composition of the Korean political conference was the adoption, under American pressure, of the so-called "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" packaged by the United States. This proposal attempts to force the political conference into separate negotiations between the armistice parties, to facilitate the United States continuing to obstruct and undermine the political conference under the guise of the United Nations. This decision by the General Assembly disregards the principled suggestions put forward by the Chinese and Korean governments on the composition of the political conference and is detrimental to the formation of the political conference and the completion of the tasks of withdrawing all foreign troops and peacefully resolving the Korean issue. Therefore, this decision is one-sided and unreasonable, and world opinion has widely expressed dissatisfaction with it.

On the 13th, China's Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued a reply to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It pointed out the unreasonableness of the resolution passed by the United Nations Seventh General Assembly regarding the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" with irrefutable arguments and a clear and fair stance. It reiterated its advocacy that the political conference should take the form of a round-table conference through joint consultation between the armistice parties with the participation of other relevant countries, and hoped that the United Nations Eighth General Assembly, which will be convened on September 15, will take steps as soon as possible to expand the membership of the political conference. All international figures who are willing to see and promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue can easily further recognize from this that this position and attitude adopted by China regarding the composition of the political conference is truly reasonable and completely necessary. Especially at present, since the other completely different position and attitude imposed on the United Nations by the United States has cast a shadow over the future of the political conference, the United Nations General Assembly's discussion on expanding the composition of the political conference is of urgent and important significance.

The reason why we advocate that the political conference should take the form of a round-table conference is reasonable, while the reason why the United States advocates taking the form of separate negotiations between the Korean armistice parties is unreasonable, is obvious. Because, the political conference is not like military armistice negotiations in nature, but a conference with broad international significance. Its task is to first negotiate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and then discuss other issues. The completion of this task is closely related to the interests of peace and security in the Far East and other countries in the world. Therefore, the political conference should never be a repeat of the Panmunjom armistice negotiation format, and there is no reason to exclude other relevant countries besides the armistice parties, especially the Soviet Union and relevant Asian countries, from participating.

The representatives of the majority of member states of the United Nations and the widespread public opinion of various countries have unanimously agreed to this obvious truth, but the United States is unwilling to accept it. The United States seems unwilling to admit that the political conference held after the Korean armistice is to discuss the creation of peace in Korea and then lead to peace in the entire Asian region. The United States can absolutely not obtain at this conference what it could not obtain on the battlefield and in the armistice negotiations. The reactionary forces in the United States are stubbornly unrepentant and afraid of peace; their minds are only filled with thoughts of war. It actually regards participation in the political conference as the privilege of belligerent countries and forcibly limits the eligibility for recommendation as members of the political conference only to countries that participated in the Korean War. For a political conference aimed at seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the United States does not allow other relevant countries that care about and insist on promoting a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue to participate. Does this not prove that the United States is determined to make the political conference full of hostile gunpowder?

In fact, this divergence manifested in the issue of the composition of the political conference means that two completely different policies are still being waged in resolving the Korean issue. That is, the struggle between our side's policy of striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue for the sake of the peace and security of the Korean people and the people of various countries in the Far East, and the United States' attempt to obstruct and undermine the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in order to maintain international tension. The reason why the U.S. war group desperately opposes the political conference taking the form of a round-table conference and insists on taking the form of separate negotiations between the armistice parties is because if the political conference is turned into Panmunjom armistice negotiations Part Two, the United States can easily continue to use various delaying and destructive means to realize its policy.

The decision made by the United Nations Seventh General Assembly on the composition of the political conference clearly makes the composition of the political conference conducive to the United States realizing its conspiracy with the Syngman Rhee group. Therefore, this cannot but be regarded in fact as an encouragement to the arrogant aggressive conspiracies of the Dulles clique.

The "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" packaged by the United States stems from the U.S.'s consistent contempt for the United Nations Charter and its attitude of turning the United Nations into a tool for its wars of aggression. It demands that the United Nations General Assembly recommend countries that participated in the aggression against the Korean War to attend the political conference, attempting to keep the United Nations as a hostile party in the Korean War and continue to make the United Nations a fig leaf for the U.S. reactionary ruling group to undermine the political conference. In order to achieve this goal, the U.S. delegation acted tyrannically at the United Nations Seventh General Assembly. It not only attempted to exclude the Soviet Union, a country supported by almost all member states of the United Nations, from participating in the political conference, but also unreasonably opposed India's participation from beginning to end, and deprived three-quarters of the member states of the equal right to participate in the political conference. The reason why their equal rights were arbitrarily deprived was merely because they did not meet the recommendation standards stipulated by the United States; they did not participate in the U.S. war of aggression against Korea. From this point of view, on which side is the United States qualified to represent the United Nations? Is the so-called United Nations side not extremely ridiculous?

In fact, the passage of the proposal for the Soviet Union to participate in the political conference by the United Nations Seventh General Assembly has already admitted that the political conference has the necessity to invite other relevant neutral countries other than the belligerent parties in Korea to participate, declaring the United States' attempt to use the United Nations as a party to the political conference bankrupt. The reason why the proposal to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the political conference was passed is obviously because the Soviet Union not only did not participate in the Korean War, but also made outstanding efforts to promote the Korean armistice and support a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This is a fact that no one can distort and overthrow. Similarly, the fact that the Political Committee of the Seventh General Assembly voted to pass the proposal for India to participate in the political conference also shows that many member states of the United Nations agree that the political conference must have India and other relevant Asian countries participate. As a result of the vote on this proposal, the unreasonable demands of the United States were defeated by a majority of twenty-seven votes to twenty-one. Almost all Asian and Arab countries, almost all "allied countries" in the North Atlantic Group, and even the vast majority of countries that were forced by the United States to participate in the war of aggression against Korea did not support the United States. This clearly shows that the passage of India's participation in the political conference by the Political Committee of the Seventh General Assembly is fair and reasonable, and this resolution should be confirmed at the United Nations Eighth General Assembly. Conversely, the passage of the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" by the United Nations Seventh General Assembly is an abnormal phenomenon caused by the United States issuing orders and exerting pressure, and it cannot express the true will of the majority of member states of the United Nations.

Now, China's Foreign Minister Zhou officially suggests that the member states participating in the political conference should be all countries on both sides of the Korean war, including the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea, as well as the invited relevant neutral countries, the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma. The participation of these many relevant neutral countries in the political conference will definitely be able to play a positive role in withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean issue. At the same time, when the Eighth General Assembly discusses the issue of expanding the membership of the political conference, it should invite China and North Korea to send representatives to attend the General Assembly to jointly consult. The Chinese government is awaiting a response from the United Nations Eighth General Assembly. The United Nations Eighth General Assembly should fully discuss the issue of expanding the membership of the political conference based on this suggestion from China's Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, make a fair and reasonable decision, and respond to the Chinese government.

This reasonable proposal put forward by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai has clearly opened the way for all United Nations member states willing to promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue to consider and discuss the issue of expanding the membership of the political conference and correct the erroneous decision of the United Nations Seventh General Assembly. With the date of the political conference approaching, this test facing the United Nations is of great importance. The U.S. conspiracy to use the United Nations to obstruct and undermine the political conference must be defeated. This is an urgent task related to safeguarding the principles of the United Nations and the interests of the peace and security of all countries.

    必须讨论扩大政治会议成员问题
    联合国第七届大会关于朝鲜政治会议组成问题讨论的结果，竟在美国的压力下通过了美国包办提出的所谓“十五国提案”，企图强使政治会议变为停战双方的单独谈判，以便利美国继续打着联合国的旗帜阻挠和破坏政治会议。大会的这个决定，既拒不考虑中朝两国政府先后对政治会议组成问题提出的原则性建议，也不利于政治会议的组成及完成撤退一切外国军队与和平解决朝鲜问题的任务。因而，这个决定是片面的、不合理的，世界各国舆论对此广泛表示不满。
    十三日，我国周恩来外长发表了答复联合国秘书长的复函。它以不可辩驳的论据和明确公正的立场，指出了联合国第七届大会通过“十五国提案”的决议的不合理，重申主张政治会议应采取停战双方在其他有关国家参加下共同协商的圆桌会议的形式，并希望即将在九月十五日召开的联合国第八届大会尽速采取步骤来扩大政治会议的成员。所有愿意看到并促成朝鲜问题和平解决的国际人士，都不难从这里进一步认识到：我国对于政治会议组成问题所采取的这个立场和态度，是真正合理的、完全必要的；特别是在目前，由于美国强加在联合国身上的另一截然不同的立场和态度，已给政治会议前途投下了一层暗影，因而，联合国大会讨论扩大政治会议的组成问题，是具有迫切的重要意义的。
    我们主张政治会议采取圆桌会议形式之所以合理，而美国主张采取朝鲜停战双方单独谈判形式之所以不合理，是显而易见的。因为，政治会议并非如军事性质的停战谈判，而是带有广泛的国际意义的会议，其任务是先行协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题，然后再讨论其他问题，而这个任务的完成又密切关系到远东及世界各国和平与安全的利益，所以，政治会议决不应该是板门店停战谈判形式的重复，决无理由排除停战双方以外的其他有关国家、尤其是苏联和亚洲有关国家参加。
    对于这个明显的道理，联合国多数会员国代表的发言和各国的广泛舆论都一致首肯，但是美国却不愿加以接受。美国似乎还不肯承认朝鲜停战后举行的政治会议，是讨论缔造朝鲜和平进而引向全亚洲范围内的和平的问题的，美国绝对不可能在这个会议上取得它在战场上和停战谈判中所得不到的东西。美国反动势力顽固不化，害怕和平，他们的脑子里只有战争思想。它居然把参加政治会议视为交战国的特权，强行限定只有参加朝鲜战争的国家才有资格被推荐为政治会议的成员。对于旨在谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的政治会议，美国却不容许关心并坚持促成朝鲜问题和平解决的其他有关国家参加。这难道不是证明美国一心要使政治会议充满敌对的火药气味吗？
    实际上，表现在政治会议组成问题上的这个分歧，是意味着在解决朝鲜问题上仍然继续展开着两种截然不同的政策的斗争，即我方坚持为了朝鲜人民和远东各国人民的和平与安全的利益而争取和平解决朝鲜问题的政策，和美国企图阻挠和破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决，以便保持国际紧张局势的政策之间的斗争。美国好战集团所以拚命反对政治会议采取圆桌会议的形式，坚持主张采取停战双方单独谈判的形式，就是因为如果把政治会议变为板门店停战谈判第二，美国就易于继续使用各种拖延和破坏手段，实现它的这个政策。
    联合国第七届大会关于政治会议组成问题所作的决定，显然是使政治会议的组成有利于美国实现它与李承晚集团的预谋的，因而，这在事实上不能不被认为是对杜勒斯之流的狂妄侵略阴谋的一种鼓励。
    美国所包办提出的“十五国提案”，是从美国一贯地蔑视联合国宪章，把联合国变为它的侵略战争工具的态度出发，要求联合国大会推荐参加侵略朝鲜战争的国家出席政治会议，企图把联合国仍然作为朝鲜交战中的敌对一方，使联合国继续成为美国反动统治集团进行破坏政治会议的一块遮羞布。为了达到这个目的，美国代表团在联合国第七届大会上横行霸道，不仅曾经企图排除苏联这个为联合国中几乎是全体会员国所支持的国家参加政治会议，而且自始至终蛮横无理地反对印度参加，并剥夺了四分之三的会员国参加政治会议的平等权利。它们的平等权利之所以横被剥夺，仅仅是因为不符合美国规定的推荐标准，它们没有参加美国的侵略朝鲜战争。由此看来，到底美国是在那一方面有资格代表联合国呢？所谓联合国一方之类的奇谈不是十分可笑的吗？
    实际上，联合国第七届大会通过苏联参加政治会议的提案，就已承认了政治会议有邀请在朝鲜的交战双方以外的其他有关的中立国家参加的必要，使美国利用联合国作为政治会议的一方的企图宣告破产了。邀请苏联参加政治会议的提案之所以被通过，显然是由于苏联不但没有参加朝鲜战争，而且对于促进朝鲜停战和支持和平解决朝鲜问题做了卓越的努力。这是任何人不能加以歪曲和推翻的事实。同样地，七届联大政治委员会表决通过印度参加政治会议的提案这一事实，也表明了联合国许多会员国都赞同政治会议必须有印度等亚洲其他有关国家参加。这个提案表决的结果，以二十七票对二十一票的多数，击败了美国的无理主张。几乎全部的亚洲和阿剌伯国家、几乎全部的北大西洋集团中的“同盟国”，甚至是被美国强迫参加侵朝战争的绝大多数国家，都没有支持美国。这就清楚地说明，七届联大政治委员会通过印度参加政治会议，是公正合理的，这个决议应该在联合国第八届大会上确定下来。相反地，联合国第七届大会通过“十五国提案”则是美国发号施令，施行压力所造成的不正常现象，它是不能表达联合国多数会员国的真正意志的。
    现在，我国周外长正式建议参加政治会议的成员国，应为在朝鲜交战双方的全体国家，包括朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜在内，以及被邀请的有关中立国家苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦、缅甸。这许多有关中立国家参加政治会议，对于从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题，必将能够发生积极作用。同时，八届联大讨论扩大政治会议成员的问题时，应邀请中朝两国派遣代表出席大会，共同协商。我国政府正等待联合国第八届大会的回答。联合国第八届大会完全应该就我国周恩来外长的这个建议，来讨论扩大政治会议的成员问题，做出公正的合理的决定，并回答我国政府。
    我周恩来外长提出的这个合理建议，显然已为所有愿意促成朝鲜问题得到和平解决的联合国会员国，考虑和讨论扩大政治会议的成员问题，改正联合国第七届大会的错误决定，打开了道路。政治会议召开的日期在即，联合国面临的这一次考验，关系重大。美国利用联合国阻挠和破坏政治会议的阴谋计划必须被击败，这是有关维护联合国的原则和各国和平与安全的利益的迫切任务。
