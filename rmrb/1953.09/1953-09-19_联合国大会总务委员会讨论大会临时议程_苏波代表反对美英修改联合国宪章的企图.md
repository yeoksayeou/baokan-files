(Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 18th) TASS, New York, September 17th: The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the afternoon of September 16th. The meeting adopted the proposal of the UN Secretary-General to set December 8th as the closing date for the Eighth General Assembly. It then proceeded to discuss the provisional agenda of the General Assembly. The representative of the Union of South Africa opposed the inclusion of items 20 and 21 on the agenda, which are: the question of the treatment of people of Indian origin in the Union of South Africa and the question of racial conflict resulting from the apartheid policies of the Government of the Union of South Africa.

The General Committee approved the inclusion of both items on the agenda.

During the discussion of the remaining items on the provisional agenda, the Soviet representative, Ya. A. Malik, opposed the inclusion of items 70 and 72 concerning preparations for amending the UN Charter. Malik emphasized that if these two items were included on the agenda, they could be used by certain countries to carry out new conspiracies to weaken and undermine the UN Charter and damage the cause of peace.

The Polish representative, Katz-Suchy, also reminded everyone that attempts to amend the UN Charter would only hinder efforts to ease international tensions and strengthen international cooperation and peace. Representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom denied that they had any bad intentions in proposing these two items. They insisted that the reason they put forward suggestions on amending the Charter was merely out of a desire to "improve" the structure of the Charter.

During the discussion, the Soviet representative, Malik, reiterated that the United Nations is now facing the very important task of strengthening international security, and that discussing amendments to the Charter would only create new tensions and undermine the already significantly improved international atmosphere, which cannot be tolerated. However, the General Committee, by a vote of twelve in favor and two abstentions (Soviet Union and Poland), approved the inclusion of items 70 and 72 on the agenda.

The General Committee then approved the inclusion of all other items on the provisional agenda and assigned these items to the various committees for discussion.

The Korean question will be discussed in the Political Committee. The plenary session of the General Assembly will begin its general debate on September 17th.

    联合国大会总务委员会讨论大会临时议程
    苏波代表反对美英修改联合国宪章的企图
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社纽约十七日讯：联合国大会总务委员会九月十六日下午举行会议。会议通过了联合国秘书长的提议，以十二月八日为第八届大会的闭会日期，接着便讨论大会临时议程。南非联邦代表反对把第二十项和第二十一项列入大会议程，这两项议程是：南非联邦印度籍人民待遇问题和由于南非联邦政府实行种族隔离政策而引起的种族冲突问题。
    总务委员会通过把这两项列入议程。
    在讨论临时议程的其余项目时，苏联代表雅·亚·马立克反对把第七十项和第七十二项有关为修改联合国宪章作准备的问题列入议程。马立克着重指出，如果将这两项列入议程，就可能被某些国家利用来进行新的阴谋，以削弱、破坏联合国宪章并损害和平事业。
    波兰代表卡茨—苏希也提醒大家说，企图修改联合国宪章的举动，只会阻碍缓和国际紧张局势和加强国际合作与和平的工作。美国和英国代表否认在提出这两个项目时含有任何不好的用意。他们硬说，他们之所以提出有关修改宪章的建议，仅仅是出于想“改进”宪章的结构的愿望。
    在讨论过程中，苏联代表马立克再度强调说，联合国现在面临着加强国际安全的非常重要的任务，讨论修改宪章只会造成新的紧张局势，破坏已有显著改善的国际气氛，这是不能容许的。但是，总务委员会以十二票赞成、两票（苏联和波兰）弃权，通过把第七十项和第七十二项列入议程。
    总务委员会接着通过把临时议程上所有其他项目列入议程，并把这些项目分配给各委员会去讨论。
    朝鲜问题将在政治委员会讨论。大会全体会议将于九月十七日开始一般辩论。
