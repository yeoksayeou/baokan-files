The All-China Federation of Cooperatives recently issued instructions on autumn flood season work for fishery cooperatives this year. The instructions pointed out that with the autumn fishing season approaching, all regions should do the following:

    1.  In accordance with the business policy of providing services for production through supply and marketing, inspect the work of grassroots fishery cooperatives to ensure they are prepared to supply production and living materials and market fishery products for autumn and winter fishing production. In areas affected by typhoons, cooperate with Party committees and governments to mobilize fishermen to engage in self-help production and mutual social assistance; cooperatives should make helping fishermen solve tool problems an important task.

    2.  Regarding fishery cooperative loans, summarize experiences and report on the situation. It is understood that some grassroots cooperatives cannot obtain loans at all, which affects the supply of means of production and the marketing of fishery products; some regions provide loans "on demand" without considering business needs and loan plans, resulting in some loans not being recovered when due. These shortcomings must be corrected.

    3.  Strengthen mass-based safety protection work for fishermen. Many fishing boats in Guangdong and Hunan are equipped with simple devices such as paulownia "wooden floats" or bamboo poles, which can protect fishermen's lives in emergencies. All regions should mobilize fishermen to use methods that are "low cost and highly effective" to do a good job in safety work. Cadres of fishery cooperatives should learn basic knowledge of natural climate and regularly conduct publicity and education work for fishermen.

    4.  In order to ensure the normal development of fisheries, autumn and winter leadership and support for fisheries production should be used to recruit members, expand share capital, and consolidate cooperatives. In areas where fishery cooperatives are weak, fishery cooperatives of a supply and marketing nature should be actively organized according to the needs of fishermen. In areas where mutual aid teams have a foundation and the conditions are right, priority should be given to helping fishermen organize fishery production cooperatives. According to the needs of various regions, study the establishment of fishery joint cooperatives in important ports or islands; however, this must be planned uniformly by the relevant provincial and municipal general cooperatives and approved by the Party committees and governments to avoid overlapping institutions.

The instructions require all regions to study and arrange work in accordance with the above spirit, combined with local conditions, and to report the implementation status at any time. The instructions also pointed out that some regions have unsound leadership institutions, resulting in a lack of leadership; some grassroots cooperative cadres are impure; some fishery cooperatives do not sufficiently recognize the urgent need of fisherman members to market fishery products; some fishery cooperatives even engage in businesses unrelated to fishery production and do not supply members with urgently needed production supplies such as fishing nets, oil, and hemp. These phenomena must be corrected.

    中华全国合作社联合总社
    发出今年渔业合作社秋汛工作的指示
    中华全国合作社联合总社日前发出今年渔业合作社秋汛工作的指示。指示指出，目前面临秋汛渔季，各地应作好下列工作：
    一、根据为生产服务的供应和推销的业务方针，检查渔业基层合作社的工作，使其为秋、冬渔业生产作好生产资料、生活资料的供应和渔产品推销的准备工作。在遭受风灾的地区要配合党委、政府发动渔民生产自救，社会互济；合作社应把帮助渔民解决工具问题当做一项重要工作。
    二、关于渔业合作社贷款问题，应总结经验，汇报情况。据了解，有些地区的基层社根本贷不到款，以致影响生产资料供应和渔产推销；有些地区不根据业务需要与贷款计划，“有求必应”地进行贷款，以致有的贷款到期不能收回。这些缺点必须纠正。
    三、必须加强群众性的渔民安全保护工作。广东、湖南有不少的渔船，都备有梧桐“木漂”或竹竿等简单设备，必要时可保护渔民生命的安全。各地应动员渔民用“钱少作用大”的方法，作好安全工作。渔业合作社的干部应学习自然气候常识，经常向渔民作宣传教育工作。
    四、为使渔业得到正常发展，应通过秋、冬领导与扶持渔业生产，吸收社员、扩大股金、巩固合作社。在渔业合作社薄弱的地区，应根据渔民需要，积极组织供销性质的渔业合作社。在互助组有基础、有条件的地区，应重点帮助渔民组织渔业生产社。根据各地需要，研究在重要港口或海岛建立渔业联合社；但必须由有关省、市总社统一筹划，经党委、政府同意，以免机构重叠。
    指示要求各地根据以上精神，结合当地具体情况，研究布置，并将执行情况随时上报。指示并指出：有些地区由于领导机构不健全，形成无人领导；有些基层社干部不纯；有些渔业合作社对渔民社员迫切需要推销渔产认识不足；有些渔业合作社竟作些和渔业生产无关的业务，不供应社员迫切需要的鱼网、油和麻等生产用品。这些现象，必须注意纠正。
