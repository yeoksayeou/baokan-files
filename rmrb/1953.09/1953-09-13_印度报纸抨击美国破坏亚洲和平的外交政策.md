    Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, September 11th (TASS): Indian newspapers have severely criticized the US government's foreign policy of obstructing the establishment of peace in Asia and the world and attempting to turn the United Nations into its tool. The "People's Power" newspaper wrote: "Dulles said that because India did not send troops to Korea, it should not participate in the political conference. In other words, India lost its seat at the conference because of its policy. If India had not adopted a neutral policy, if India had driven its youth into a brutal war, the 'almighty' United Nations would have generously allowed India to participate in the political conference."

    The "Lok Yug" weekly, published in Punjabi, stated that the United States' policy shows that although the American imperialists were forced to sign the armistice agreement in Korea, they still harbor plans to turn Korea into a hotbed of war. The newspaper emphasized that these actions "clearly illustrate which of the two countries, the Soviet Union and the United States, is truly pursuing the path of peace and international friendship."

    The "People's Daily" of Lucknow indignantly discussed Washington's intention to revise the UN Charter in order to "expand the anti-communist front."

    印度报纸抨击美国破坏亚洲和平的外交政策
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社德里十一日电：印度各报严厉抨击美国政府的阻碍建立亚洲与全世界和平，企图变联合国为它的工具的外交政策。“人民力量”报写道：“杜勒斯说，由于印度没有派军队到朝鲜去，所以它不应参加政治会议。换句话说，印度丧失它在会议上的席次是由于它的政策。假如印度没有采取中立政策，假如印度曾把它的青年赶进残酷的战争去的话，‘万能’的联合国就会慨然允许印度参加政治会议了。”
    以旁遮普文出版的“洛宇”周刊说：美国的政策说明：虽然美帝国主义者被迫在朝鲜签订了停战协定，但是他们仍然怀着变朝鲜为战争温床的计划。该报着重指出：这些行动“明白地说明苏联与美国这两国到底是谁走着和平与国际友好的道路”。
    勒克瑙的“人民报”愤慨地谈到了华盛顿想修改联合国宪章，以“扩大反共阵线”的意图。
