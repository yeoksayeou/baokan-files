The Struggle Between the US and Britain for Markets
Soviet Union Na. Torusuyev

The United States has widely exploited the weakening of British power after World War II to enhance its position in the trade of capitalist countries. On the one hand, American monopoly capitalists have squeezed their British rivals out of the markets of many countries; on the other hand, they have tried every possible means to prevent the commodities of Britain and other countries from entering the domestic market of the United States. Not content with this, the United States also restricts Britain's trade with countries in the peaceful democratic camp. All this has seriously damaged Britain's economic interests.

American monopoly capitalists have flooded the markets of the British Commonwealth countries with their commodities. As a result, Britain's share of trade in these countries has shrunk, while the United States' share has increased. If in 1938, the United States accounted for only 20 percent of the imports of the British Commonwealth countries and Britain accounted for 31 percent, then in 1952, the United States accounted for 32 percent, which was equal to Britain.

In other markets of great importance to Britain, especially in the Latin American market, the pace of encroachment by American monopolies is even more urgent. The British magazine "The Economist" wrote: "The European war made it entirely possible for the United States to seize the Latin American market, and they have quickly taken advantage of this possibility." After the war, the United States launched an even more violent offensive against Britain's trade territory in Latin America than before. The United States has exerted various pressures on British companies to restrict their activities. In 1951 alone, American monopoly capitalists shipped seven times more goods to Latin American countries than Britain shipped to these countries in the five years from 1947 to 1951.

Although Britain made great efforts to increase its exports to continental European countries to twice the pre-war level, the United States' exports to these countries increased even faster—they have increased 3.5 times. In Britain's foreign trade, the export of cotton textiles occupies a very important position. If in 1950, Britain exported 687 million meters of cotton textiles, while the United States exported only 468 million meters; then in 1952, according to "The Economist" magazine, the United States' exports of these textiles had increased to about 650 million meters, exceeding Britain's exports (Britain's exports were 624 million meters).

In order to gain a more solid position in the markets of the British Commonwealth countries, American monopoly capitalists have long opposed the so-called imperial preference system—the preferential tariff system enjoyed by British Commonwealth countries in their mutual trade. As early as 1945, when the United States and Britain held negotiations on American loans to Britain, the United States forced Britain to agree to gradually abolish imperial preference. In 1947, at the suggestion of American monopoly capitalists, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was signed, according to which Britain promised not to expand the preferential tariff system in the British Commonwealth. This allowed American goods to enter British traditional markets more freely, as a result, American companies expelled British goods and quickly consolidated their position in the British Commonwealth countries.

In Britain, calls for opposition to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have become more and more frequent. For example, last October, Leslie Gamage, Director of the London Export Institute, in a speech in Liverpool, called on the British Commonwealth countries to "get rid of the shackles of the General Agreement and maintain imperial preference." Emery, a prominent figure in the Conservative Party, declared that if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were fully implemented, then Britain would suffer "inevitable and complete" destruction.

Other countries in the British Commonwealth have also expressed dissatisfaction with the General Agreement. Because according to this agreement, American monopoly capitalists have forced other countries to make many concessions, promoting the export of American goods to the signatory countries of the agreement. However, the restrictions imposed on the United States itself are negligible. British newspapers predict that at the regular meeting of the signatory countries of the agreement to be held in September, some countries will propose abolishing the General Agreement. The "Financial Times," the mouthpiece of the British business community, claimed that the results of the implementation of American trade policy have made people "doubt" the benefits of the General Agreement.

The main reason for the dissatisfaction of British business people is that American tariffs, although reduced a little under the agreement, are still very high. The import tax levied by the United States on many commodities is equal to 30 to 50 percent of the cost of these commodities. And as the American "Atlantic Monthly" said: "For foreign exporters, even an import tax of only 15 to 20 percent often constitutes a very serious obstacle." Although the current American import tax is already very high, the United States Tariff Commission has received more and more applications from American companies requesting to increase the import tax on various commodities. Nearly 40 such applications have been submitted to the Tariff Commission for review. Many of the commodities involved in these applications are closely related to Britain's exports. For example, the American Textile Machinery Manufacturers Association has requested to increase the import tax on carding machines by three times, which makes it completely impossible for Britain to export these machines to the United States.

Extremely complicated tariff procedures are a serious obstacle to the import of British goods into the United States. The procedures are so complicated that even an official American report says: "The time it takes for many goods to pass through American customs is simply longer than the time it took Columbus to discover America."

Last year, the British government submitted a special memorandum to the American government, in which Britain expressed its concern about the growing demand for higher tariffs in the United States. Britain warned that the difficulties Britain faced in exporting to the United States would affect Britain's willingness to "cooperate with the United States in trade and other areas." But since then, the conditions for importing British goods into the United States have deteriorated further, and the prospects for British-American trade are still very bleak.

At the beginning of this year, the British Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer went to Washington with the aim of firmly demanding that the United States relax the restrictions Britain faced in British-American trade. They demanded that so-called "aid" be replaced by "trade, not aid," in other words, to replace the method by which American monopoly capitalists dump obsolete goods in the Western European market by exploiting American taxpayers with normal trade relations. The American ruling group rejected Britain's demands, they preferred "aid" to allowing British goods to enter the American market.

One of the means by which American monopoly capitalists oppose British companies is to implement "price-cutting" on raw materials exported by British Commonwealth countries. "The Economist" magazine complained that the United States uses "all means and all opportunities to artificially depress prices." The British "Daily Express" pointed out that American companies sell their cotton at a price that is six times higher than before the war, but only buy rubber at a price that is one times higher than before the war, and buy tin at a price that is two and a half times higher than before the war. The newspaper said, "As usual: when the United States wants to sell goods, it demands the highest price; when the United States wants to buy goods, it tries to lower the price as much as possible."

The "price-cutting" policy is particularly evident in the rubber market. In 1951, the United States greatly reduced its purchases of natural rubber and expanded the use of synthetic rubber, causing a sharp drop in the price of natural rubber. As a result, the value of dollars flowing into Britain each year decreased by approximately 50 million pounds. In the tin market, American monopoly capitalists also adopted the same method: in March 1951, the United States suddenly announced the "cessation of strategic storage of tin," causing the price of tin in London to fall from $4,060 per ton to $3,400 per ton. A committee of the United States Congress described this behavior as an American "economic victory" in its report.

While American monopoly capitalists "cut prices" on British commodities, they also tried to raise the prices of their own commodities (such as wheat). As Rocart Helms, Chairman of the Liverpool Grain Merchants Association, said, Britain has long been forced to buy American agricultural products at "inflated high prices." Not long ago, Britain had to refuse to sign a new international wheat agreement because the United States forced other countries participating in the agreement to accept wheat prices that were even higher than when the 1949 agreement was signed.

The attitude taken by Britain on the issue of wheat prices aroused the dissatisfaction of the United States. American newspapers even threatened that "Congress will not easily forget Britain's attitude towards the wheat agreement."

Because American monopoly capitalists interfere with trade between Britain and countries in the peaceful democratic camp in order to undermine this trade, Britain's economic interests are greatly harmed. As early as 1948, the United States used the threat of stopping so-called "aid" as a means to force Western European countries to drastically reduce trade with Eastern European countries. As a result, Britain's trade with these countries was reduced to one-seventh of what it was before the war. This situation dealt a heavy blow to Britain, causing it to lose its commodity market and lose its source of timber, feed, grain and other important goods that could be purchased without using dollars. Former British Under-Secretary of Overseas Trade, Botonley, recently wrote: "We are doing too little business with the Russians. This is a tragedy and it is absolutely unnecessary."

Labor Party leader Attlee also pointed out in a speech in Parliament not long ago that Britain's hopes of expanding trade with the United States have been greatly reduced, but at the same time, the United States still wants to encourage Britain not to trade with China.

Therefore, the purpose of American trade policy is to squeeze British goods out of the markets of many countries, restrict the export of British goods to the American market, and undermine Britain's traditional trade relations with countries in the peaceful democratic camp. All of this cannot but cause the contradictions between the United States and Britain to become more acute.

Britain's dissatisfaction with this policy of the United States is growing, and the desire to restore national economic independence is becoming stronger and stronger.

    美英争夺市场的斗争
    苏联  纳·托尔苏耶夫
    美国广泛利用第二次世界大战后英国势力的削弱，来增强自己在资本主义国家贸易中的地位。美国垄断资本家一方面从许多国家的市场上将它的英国对手排挤出去，一方面百般阻挠英国和其他国家的商品进入美国国内市场。美国还不以此为满足，它又限制英国与和平民主阵营国家进行贸易。所有这一切都使得英国的经济利益受到了严重的损害。
    美国垄断资本家使自己的商品充斥于英联邦国家的市场。结果，英国在这些国家的贸易中所占的比重缩小了，而美国所占的比重增加了。如果说在
    一九三八年，美国在英联邦国家的进口中所占的比重仅为百分之二十，英国为百分之三十一，那末，在一九五二年，美国所占的比重就达到百分之三十二，已经和英国相等了。
    在对英国具有重要意义的其他市场上，特别是在拉丁美洲的市场上，美国垄断资本侵入的步调更加急迫。英国“经济学家”杂志写道：“欧洲的战争使美国完全有可能来夺取拉丁美洲的市场，他们已经迅速地利用了这种可能性。”战争结束后，美国对英国在拉丁美洲的贸易地盘，展开了比从前更加猛烈的进攻。美国对英国公司施用种种压力，以限制它们的活动。仅在一九五一年一年中，美国垄断资本家输往拉丁美洲国家的商品就比英国在一九四七年至一九五一年五年中输往这些国家的商品多七倍。
    虽然英国费了很大力气把自己对欧洲大陆国家的输出增加到战前水平的两倍。但美国对这些国家的输出却增加得更快——它已增为三点五倍了。在英国的对外贸易中，棉织品的输出占有极重要的地位。如果说在一九五○年英国输出的棉织品为六亿八千七百万公尺，美国仅为四亿六千八百万公尺；那末，在一九五二年，根据“经济学家”杂志的统计，美国输出的这些纺织品已增至六亿五千万公尺左右，超过了英国的输出额（英国为六亿二千四百万公尺）。
    美国垄断资本家为了要在英联邦国家的市场上取得更巩固的地位，很久以来就一直反对所谓帝国优惠制——英联邦国家在相互贸易中享受的特惠关税制度。早在一九四五年，当美英举行关于美国贷款给英国的谈判时，美国就强迫英国同意逐步废除帝国优惠制。一九四七年，在美国垄断资本家的建议下，签订了国际关税及贸易总协定，根据这个协定，英国答应不在英联邦扩大特惠关税制度。这使得美国商品可以更自由地进入英国传统市场，结果，美国公司驱逐了英国商品，迅速地巩固了它在英联邦国家中的地位。
    在英国，反对国际关税及贸易总协定的呼声已越来越频繁。例如，去年十月间，伦敦出口研究所所长莱斯里·加美吉在利物浦发表的演说中，就要求英联邦国家“摆脱总协定的束缚，并维护帝国优惠制”。保守党的著名人物埃麦里宣称：如果国际关税及贸易总协定被充分实施，那末，英国就要遭到“不可避免的和彻底的”毁灭。
    英国联邦中的其他国家也对总协定表示不满。因为根据这个协定，美国垄断资本家迫使其他国家作了很多的让步，促进了美国商品对协定签字国的输出。而美国本身所受到的限制却是微不足道的。英国报纸预言：在九月间行将举行的协定签字国的例会上，某些国家将提出废除总协定的要求。英国企业界喉舌“金融时报”声称：美国贸易政策施行的结果，已使人们对总协定的好处发生“怀疑”。
    英国企业界人士表示不满的主要原因是：美国的关税尽管根据这个协定降低了一点，但还是很高的。美国对许多商品所征收的进口税，等于这些商品成本的百分之三十到百分之五十。而且正如美国“大西洋月刊”所说：“对外国出口商说来，即使只征收百分之十五到百分之二十的进口税，也往往要构成极严重的障碍。”虽然目前美国的进口税已经很高，但美国关税委员会却从美国公司那里收到了越来越多的申请书，要求提高各种各样商品的进口税。提交关税委员会加以审查的这类申请书已近四十起。这些申请书所涉及的商品有许多是和英国的出口货有密切关系的。例如，美国纺织机器制造商协会要求将梳毛机的进口税提高三倍，这就使得英国完全不可能再向美国输出这些机器。
    极端复杂的关税手续是妨碍英国商品输入美国的严重障碍。手续之繁到了如此地步，甚至美国官方的一个报告中也说：“许多商品通过美国海关需要的时间简直比哥伦布发现美洲需要的时间还长。”
    去年英国政府以特别备忘录递交美国政府，英国在备忘录中，对美国国内日益增长的提高关税的要求，表示不安。英国警告说，英国在对美国出口方面所遇到的困难，将会影响到英国“在贸易和其他方面与美国合作”的愿望。但从那时以来，英国商品输入美国的条件更加恶化了，而英美贸易的前途仍然是非常黯淡的。
    今年年初，英国外交大臣和财政大臣前往华盛顿，目的是坚决要求美国放宽英国在英美贸易方面所受到的限制。他们要求：以“要贸易，不要援助”来代替所谓“援助”，换句话说，也就是用正常的贸易关系来代替美国垄断资本家靠剥削美国纳税人来向西欧市场倾销陈货的办法。美国统治集团拒绝了英国的要求，他们宁愿“援助”，而不愿让英国商品进入美国市场。
    美国垄断资本家反对英国公司的手段之一，是对英联邦国家输出的原料实行“杀价”。“经济学家”杂志诉苦说，美国利用“一切手段和一切机会，来人为地压低价格”。英国“每日快报”指出，美国公司以超过战前六倍的价钱出售自己的棉花，却仅以超过战前一倍的价钱买进橡胶，以超过战前两倍半的价钱买进锡。这个报纸说，“照例是这样：当美国要出售商品时，它就要求最高价；当美国要买进商品时，它就竭力压低价格。”
    “杀价”政策在橡胶市场上表现得特别明显。一九五一年，美国大大削减对天然橡胶的购买，并扩大人造橡胶的使用，引起了天然橡胶的猛烈跌价。结果，每年流入英国的美元价值减少了约五千万英镑。在锡的市场上，美国垄断资本家也采取了同样的办法：一九五一年三月，美国突然宣布“停止锡的战略储存”，使伦敦的锡价从每吨四千零六十美元跌到三千四百美元。美国国会的一个委员会在它的报告中，把这种行为说成是美国的“经济胜利”。
    美国垄断资本家对英国商品进行“杀价”的同时，又极力抬高自己的商品（例如小麦）的价格。正如利物浦粮商协会主席罗卡特·赫尔姆斯所说，长期以来，英国就被迫以“膨胀的高价”购买美国的农产品。不久以前，英国不得不拒绝签订新的国际小麦协定，因为美国强迫参加协定的其他国家接受比一九四九年协定签订时还要高的小麦价格。
    英国在小麦价格问题上所采取的态度，引起了美国的不满。美国的报刊甚至威吓说，“国会不会轻易忘记英国对小麦协定的态度的。”
    由于美国垄断资本家对英国与和平民主阵营国家之间的贸易进行干涉，以便破坏这种贸易，使英国的经济利益受到极大损害。还在一九四八年，美国就以停止所谓“援助”作为威胁的手段，迫使西欧国家猛烈缩减与东欧国家的贸易。结果，英国与这些国家的贸易减到战前的七分之一。这种情况给英国以沉重的打击，使它失掉自己的商品市场，失掉不用美元就可以买到木材、饲料、粮食和其他重要货物的来源地。前英国海外贸易次官博顿莱最近写道：“我们和俄国人做的生意太少了。这是一个悲剧，而且是绝对不必要的”。
    工党领袖艾德礼不久以前在议会的演讲中也指出，英国扩大对美国贸易的希望已大为减弱了，但同时美国却还想怂恿英国不要和中国进行贸易。
    因此，美国贸易政策的目的，就是要从许多国家的市场上排挤英国商品，限制英国商品对美国市场的输出，并破坏英国与和平民主阵营国家的传统贸易关系。所有这些，不能不引起美英矛盾更加尖锐化。
    英国对美国这种政策的不满情绪正日益增长，要求恢复国家经济独立的愿望也越来越强烈了。
