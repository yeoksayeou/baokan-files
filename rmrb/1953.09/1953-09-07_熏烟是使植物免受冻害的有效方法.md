    Smudging is an Effective Way to Protect Plants from Frost Damage
    Editor's note: This text is excerpted from "Principles of Meteorology and Climatology" by Soviet Doctor of Geographical Sciences, Koshtin (translated by Du Yuecong et al., published by Zhonghua Book Company). It contains a concise and practical discussion on preventing frost damage to plants. Chinese farmers also have experience in using smudging to prevent frost damage, but this has not been systematically summarized. It is hoped that agricultural science and technology workers will refer to the Soviet experience in frost prevention, combine it with advanced scientific principles, and closely integrate it with China's specific conditions, conduct multi-faceted comparative experiments and investigations, and further make a practical and complete summary of the experience in smudging for frost prevention. It is currently early autumn, and late autumn crops, fruit crops, and vegetable crops are extremely vulnerable to severe cold. This article can be used as a reference for frost prevention in various regions.
    Spring cold and autumn cold cause very serious damage to plants, especially when severe cold occurs in late spring and early autumn. Severe cold usually occurs on clear and calm nights, and the severe cold on the ground is often the most significant. Severe cold is more intense and frequent in low-lying areas than in high-lying areas, because in low-lying areas, in addition to their own cooling, cold air flowing from slopes also accumulates here. When the slope area is large, more cold air flows into the low-lying areas. Therefore, the cold formed in the low-lying areas is even more intense.
    The condition of the air and soil has a great influence on the intensity of severe cold. Severe cold often occurs in clear, calm, and dry weather or when the sky is covered with thin clouds. The possibility of severe cold occurring when there are many clouds is very small. The possibility of severe cold occurring when the air humidity is high is also very small. Dew and frost can weaken severe cold because latent heat is released when dew and frost are formed, which prevents the temperature from continuing to drop.
    A series of methods for preventing severe cold have been studied from the practice of agricultural and forestry work. However, to prevent severe cold more successfully, it is necessary to predict severe cold. The prediction of severe cold is mostly related to the observation of air humidity and the determination of the dew point. The dew point is the temperature at which water vapor reaches saturation and condensation products such as dew and frost begin to appear on the cooling surface. Latent heat is released when water vapor condenses, which warms the air and prevents the air temperature from continuing to drop. The decrease in air temperature at night usually does not fall below the dew point. Therefore, if it is observed in the evening that the dew point is higher than zero degrees Celsius, it can be known that there will be no severe cold at night; conversely, if the dew point is below zero degrees, it is very likely that severe cold will occur at night. In this regard, there is a relatively reliable rule, that is, if the dew point drops below two degrees at nine o'clock in the evening, severe cold can be expected to occur when the sky is clear and there is no wind.
    Reduced cloud cover, a weak north wind, dry air, increased air pressure, and a significant drop in temperature after 13:00 (1:00 PM) during the day all increase the possibility and intensity of severe cold. Conversely, increased cloud cover, a south wind, increased air humidity, and decreased air pressure can reduce the possibility of severe cold. Topography can also affect the degree of temperature drop at night. In low-lying areas, the possibility and power of severe cold are increased. Severe cold is more likely to form on loose soil than on compact soil.
    Various methods are used to protect plants from severe cold.
    Smudging is a very common method of protecting plants from frost damage. When smudging, a dense smoke screen is produced. The thick smoke screen spreads over the ground, making it difficult for the ground heat to dissipate, thus protecting the plants from frost damage. In addition, when the substances that form the smoke are burned, the air layer near the ground can also be warmed to some extent. Secondly, some of the water vapor in the air will condense on the smoke particles; latent heat of vaporization is released when water vapor condenses. All of these cause the ground temperature and the temperature in the air layer near the ground to increase somewhat.
    The Soviet smudging method mainly uses smoke piles. The burning of these smoke piles is used to protect flowering vegetable crops and fruit crops, grapes, and other crops from frost damage. In field production conditions, the coverage of the smoke screen can generally raise the temperature by about one to two degrees.
    Smoke piles are made in the following way: first, drive a wooden stake into the ground, and pile straw, firewood, shavings, and other dry materials that are easy to burn around the wooden stake. Then, cover these dry materials with a layer of moist materials—rotted wet grass, straw, fallen leaves, etc. Cover the outside of this pile with a layer of eight to ten centimeters (about three inches) of soil. The height of the smoke pile is about one meter to one and a half meters (three feet to four and a half feet), and the diameter of the bottom is about one and a half meters to two meters (four and a half feet to six feet). Fifty to sixty piles should be prepared per hectare (about fifteen acres).
    When igniting the smoke pile, pull out the vertical wooden stake from inside the pile, and put straw, dry grass, and other easily combustible materials into the hole left after the wooden stake is pulled out. If the smoke pile does not smoke well, you can slightly loosen the smoke pile with a stick, so that air can enter the easily combustible materials. If the smoke pile is burning too vigorously, the pile can be slightly compacted. The smoke pile gradually burns, and the smoke can be carried by the wind to the entire protected area.
    It should be noted that smudging is only effective in flat areas. In low-lying areas, smudging has no effect. Because in this kind of ground, there is cold air flowing from the hills or the slopes of high ground.
    Various coverings are also used to protect plants from frost damage (using reeds, leaves, paper, etc.).
    If plants are growing on sloping ground, and it is necessary to protect the plants from the influence of cold air, dense shrub hedges can be planted at the upper boundary of this land. The planting position of this shrub hedge should be such that it can prevent the downward flow of cold air and can guide the cold air away from the area to be protected and flow in other directions.
    Zonal irrigation is also a method of preventing severe cold. This method can increase air humidity and increase the dew point, that is, increase the temperature at which water vapor in the air reaches saturation. Latent heat is released when water vapor condenses, which prevents the temperature from continuing to drop. Increasing air humidity can cause water vapor to condense, and latent heat can be released at a higher temperature. In addition, water vapor can also reduce the heat radiation from the ground, thus reducing the exposure of plants to cold.
    It should be noted that it is very dangerous for the heat of the sun to quickly shine on frost-damaged plants. Gradually warming the frost-damaged parts of the plants can restore the plant's life activities. Therefore, the measures taken to protect plants should not be stopped early in the morning. If smoke is used as a method of protecting plants, then to protect the plants from the effects of sunlight, the smoke screen should be maintained for some time after sunrise. Sometimes, the method of spraying water on the frost-damaged parts of the plants is also used to slowly thaw the frost-damaged parts.

    熏烟是使植物免受冻害的有效方法
    编者按：这篇文字是从苏联地理科学博士科斯晋所著“气象学与气候学原理”（杜瀹聪等译，中华书局出版）中摘录出来的，它对于防止植物冻害有简明而切实的论述。我国农民也有用熏烟法防止冻害的经验，但还没有很系统地加以总结。希望农业科学技术工作者参照苏联的防冻经验，根据先进的科学原理，密切结合我国的具体情况，进行多方面的对比试验和调查，对熏烟防冻的经验进一步作出实用的完整的总结。目前已是初秋季节，晚秋作物、果树作物和蔬菜作物极易遭受严寒侵袭，本文可供各地防冻时参考。
    春寒和秋寒使植物受到极严重的危害，尤其是在晚春和早秋发生严寒的情形下对植物的危害更大。通常严寒出现在晴朗而平静的夜间，并且发生于地面上的严寒常常最为显著。严寒在低的地方比高的地方更为强烈和经常，因为在低的地方除了它们本身冷却外，从斜坡上流来的冷空气也聚积在这里。斜坡面积很大时，流入低地的冷空气就较多。因此在低地上形成的寒冷就更加强烈。
    空气和土壤的情况对于严寒强烈的影响很大。严寒常常出现于晴朗、平静而干燥的天气或出现于天空有薄云遮蔽的时候。云量很多的时候发生严寒的可能性很小。空气湿度大的时候发生严寒的可能性也是很小的。露和霜能够使严寒减弱，因为在露和霜形成的时候放出了阻止温度继续下降的潜热。
    从农业和林业工作的实践中已经研究出一系列防止严寒的方法。但是要更成功地防止严寒，必须预知严寒。严寒的预知多半与空气湿度的观测和露点的决定有关。露点即水汽达到饱和并在冷却面上开始出现露和霜等凝结产物时的温度。在水汽凝结时放出潜热，这种潜热使空气温暖和阻止气温继续下降。夜间气温的下降通常不会低于露点。因此，如果傍晚观察露点高于摄氏零度时，则可以知道夜间不会有严寒；反之，如果露点在零度以下时，则夜间极可能出现严寒。在这方面，有一个规律是比较可靠的，即晚上九点钟时，如果露点降低到二度以下，则在天空晴朗和无风的时候就能预期发生严寒。
    云量减少、有微弱的北风、空气干燥、气压增加以及在白天的十三点钟（下午一点钟）后温度显著下降等，都增加严寒侵袭的可能性和严寒的强烈性。反之，云量增加、有南风、空气湿度增高和气压降低等，都能减少发生严寒的可能性。地势也能影响夜间温度下降的程度。在低的地方增加了严寒侵袭的可能性和严寒的威力。在疏松的土壤上比在紧密土壤上更容易形成严寒。
    为了保护植物免受严寒，采用了各种方法。
    熏烟法是保护植物免受冻害的极普遍的方法。在熏烟的时候产生浓密的烟幕。浓厚的烟幕弥漫在地面上，使地面的热不易散发，这样就能保护植物免受冻害。此外，当形成烟的物质焚烧时也能使接近地面的气层得到一些温暖。其次空气中的水蒸汽会有一部凝结在烟的微粒上；水蒸汽在凝结时是会放出汽化潜热的。这些都使得地面温度和接近地面气层中的温度有若干增加。
    苏联的熏烟法主要是利用烟堆。用这种烟堆的燃烧来保护开花的蔬菜作物和果树作物、葡萄及其它等作物，使它们免受冻害。在田间生产条件中，烟幕的笼罩大体能提高温度一度到两度左右。
    烟堆是用下面的方式造成的：先用一根木桩打入地内，在木桩的周围堆起禾秸、劈柴、刨花及其它容易燃烧的干材料。然后在这些干的材料上盖上一层潮湿材料—腐湿的草、禾秸、落叶等。在这种堆的外部覆盖八到十公分（约三寸）厚的土层。烟堆的高度约为一公尺到一公尺半（三尺到四尺半），底部的直径约为一公尺半到两公尺（四尺半到六尺）。在每公顷（约十五亩）面积上要准备五十到六十个堆。
    烟堆点火时，从堆内抽出垂直的木桩，用禾秸、干草及其它容易燃烧的材料放进木桩抽出后留下的窟窿里。如果烟堆不好好发烟，可用棍棒把烟堆稍微抬松一下，这样可使空气进入易于燃烧的材料中。如果烟堆燃烧太旺，则可将堆子稍微捣紧。烟堆渐渐燃烧，烟就能被风带到整个防护的面积上。
    应该注意，熏烟法只能在平坦的地方才能发生效果。在低洼的地方，熏烟法得不到任何效果。因为在这种地上有从山丘或高地斜坡上流来的冷空气。
    为了保护植物免受冻害，也利用各种覆盖物（用芦草、树叶、纸及其它）。
    如果植物生长在斜坡地上，而要保护植物免受冷空气的影响，可在这块土地的上部边界处种植密集的灌木篱，这种灌木篱的种植位置要使它能够阻止向下流动的冷空气，并能引导冷空气离开所要保护的地区而流到别的方向去。
    分区灌水也是一种防止严寒的方法。这种方法可以提高空气湿度和提高露点，即提高空气中的水汽达到饱和的温度。水汽凝结时会放出阻止温度继续下降的潜热。增加空气湿度就能引起水汽凝结，并在较高的温度下就能放出潜热。此外，水汽也能减少地面的热量的散发，因而使植物少受冷冻。
    应该注意，太阳的热迅速地晒在受冻的植物上，对于受冻植物是非常危险的。使植物受冻部分渐渐温暖，才能够恢复植物的生命活动。因此，为了保护植物所采用的措施不应当在清早就停止。如果以烟幕作为保护植物的方法，则为了保护植物免受阳光的影响，在日出后若干时间内还要保持烟幕。有时也运用在植物受冻部分上喷水的方法，使受冻部分慢慢地解冻。
