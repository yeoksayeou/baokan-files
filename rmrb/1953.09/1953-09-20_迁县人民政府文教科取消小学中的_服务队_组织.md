    Qian County People's Government Cultural and Educational Section Abolishes "Service Team" Organization in Primary Schools
    A letter from the Cultural and Educational Section of the People's Government of Suqian County, Jiangsu Province: After we saw the criticism letter published in the "Abstracts of Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper on July 7 regarding the inappropriateness of organizing "service teams" in some primary schools in Suqian County, we immediately conducted an investigation and dealt with it. After inspection, seven out of ten primary schools in Sucheng District of our county had established "service team" organizations among students. This practice not only violates the principle of cultivating children's conscious compliance with discipline, but also affects students' physical health and studies. Now, the Sucheng District cultural and educational administrative department has announced the abolition of the "service team" organizations in these primary schools, and on July 22, it analyzed and criticized this issue at a meeting of all teachers in the district, explaining that the scope of primary school children's rotating duty service is mainly to maintain the cleanliness and hygiene of each class.

    迁县人民政府文教科取消小学中的“服务队”组织
    江苏省宿迁县人民政府文教科来信：我们看到七月七日你报“读者来信摘要”栏内刊登的宿迁县某些小学不应在学生中组织“服务队”的批评信之后，当即进行了解处理。经检查，我县宿城区十所小学中，有七所在学生中建立了“服务队”的组织。这种做法不但和培养儿童自觉遵守纪律的原则有所违背，而且也影响了学生的身体健康和学习。现在宿城区文教行政部门已经宣布取消这些小学中的“服务队”组织，并于七月二十二日在全区教师会议上对这一问题作了分析、批判，说明小学儿童轮流值日服务的范围主要是维持各班级的清洁卫生。
