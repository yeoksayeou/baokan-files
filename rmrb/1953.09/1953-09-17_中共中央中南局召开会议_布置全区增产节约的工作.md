The CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau Convenes a Meeting
Deploying the Whole Region's Work on Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

[This newspaper's dispatch] The CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau convened a meeting of responsible party cadres on September 14th. At the meeting, Li Xiannian, Third Deputy Secretary of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau, gave a report on increasing production and practicing economy, and Ye Jianying, Acting Secretary of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau, also spoke.

In his report, Li Xiannian first analyzed the financial and economic situation in the whole region, pointing out that increasing production and practicing economy is the most urgent task in the region's current financial and economic work. He called on the whole party to mobilize, strengthen ties with the masses, thoroughly implement the party's policies, seize key points, tap potential, accurately calculate income and expenditure, overcome difficulties, and victoriously complete this year's national plan.

Next, Li Xiannian pointed out the methods for increasing production and practicing economy:

First, it is necessary to increase production, which is the main source of increased income. To this end, in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party, strengthen the work of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and at the same time actively strengthen planning management, implement work plans and establish a responsibility system, and lead the workers and masses to carry out labor emulation. In the competition, attention should be paid to finding shortcuts, tapping potential, and promoting advanced experiences, so as to over fulfill the state production plan and hand over profits. While increasing production, industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises should pay special attention to improving quality, reducing costs, and saving raw materials, so as to create more wealth for the country. In agricultural production, it is necessary to mobilize farmers to increase production of grain and non-staple food. Although the planting season in the South has passed this year, it is still necessary to vigorously organize the masses to carry out autumn plowing and planting, and expand the acreage of autumn-planted and spring-harvested crops. Efforts should also be made to complete the predetermined plan for agricultural tax collection.

Second, organize and expand material exchange. State-owned trade departments and cooperatives should actively purchase grain and cotton, expand the sales of daily-use industrial products, accelerate capital turnover, and reduce circulation costs.

Third, strengthen tax work. Tax departments should further rely on the leadership of the Party and the assistance of workers and shop assistants to oppose illegal capitalists' tax evasion. With the development of production and the expansion of material exchange, taxes should be increased realistically.

Fourth, practice strict economy and tighten expenditures, which is the most effective and fastest way to ensure increased income. In construction work, it is necessary to implement the principle of focusing on key construction; as long as it is a national key construction project, it must be fully guaranteed to be completed; unimportant projects should be resolutely reduced. In addition, the phenomenon of not strictly controlling expenditures and relaxing financial supervision should be prevented and corrected; the tendency not to accumulate funds for the country should be prevented and corrected.

In his speech, Ye Jianying requested that financial and economic organs and their affiliated enterprises, administrative departments, and party committees and party groups in various units immediately conduct in-depth mobilization, quickly formulate implementation plans and indicators for increasing production and practicing economy, and earnestly implement them after being approved by higher-level organs. He also requested that the party committees and party groups report the progress of increasing production and practicing economy to the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau every ten days to two weeks.

Before the meeting, the Urban Work Department of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau, the Central-South Financial and Economic Committee, and the Central-South Work Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other departments held meetings separately to review past work and study specific methods for increasing production and practicing economy.

    中共中央中南局召开会议
    布置全区增产节约的工作
    【本报讯】中共中央中南局在九月十四日召开了党员负责干部会议。会上，中共中央中南局第三副书记李先念作了关于增产节约的报告，中共中央中南局代理书记叶剑英也讲了话。
    李先念在报告中首先分析了全区的财政经济工作情况，指出增产节约是目前全区财政经济工作中最紧迫的任务。他号召全党动员起来，加强与群众的联系，很好地贯彻党的政策，并抓住关键，发掘潜力，精确计算收入与支出，克服困难，胜利完成今年国家计划。
    接着，李先念指出了关于增产节约的作法：
    第一，要增加生产，这是增加收入的主要源泉。为此，在工矿交通企业方面，应当加强党的领导，加强工会与青年团的工作，同时要积极加强计划管理，推行作业计划和建立责任制，领导职工群众开展劳动竞赛。在竞赛中，要注意找窍门，挖潜力，推广先进经验，以达到超额完成国家生产计划与上缴利润的目的。在增加生产的同时，各工矿交通企业应特别注意提高质量，降低成本，节约原材料，为国家创造更多的财富。在农业生产方面，要动员农民增产粮食与副食品。今年南方耕种时期虽然已经过去，仍应大力组织群众进行秋耕秋种，并扩大秋种春收的作物面积。农业税徵收的预订计划也应努力争取完成。
    第二，组织与扩大物资交流。国营贸易部门和合作社应当积极收购粮食、棉花和扩大推销日用工业品，并加速资金周转，减低流转费用。
    第三，加强税收工作。税收部门应进一步依靠党的领导与职工、店员的协助，反对不法资本家偷税漏税的行为。随着生产的发展和物资交流的扩大，要实事求是地增加税收。
    第四，厉行节约、紧缩开支，这是保证增加收入最有效而又最快的办法。在建设工作中，必须贯彻重点建设的方针，只要是国家重点建设工程，必须全力保证完成；对不重要的项目，应坚决削减。此外，应防止与纠正不严格控制开支和放松财务监督的现象；防止与纠正不为国家积累资金的偏向。
    叶剑英在讲话中，要求财经机关与所属企业单位及行政部门和各单位中的党委、党组，立即深入动员，迅速作出增产节约的实施计划与指标，经过上级机关批准，认真实行。他并要求党委、党组每十天到两星期，向中共中央中南局汇报一次增产节约进展的情况。
    会议召开之前，中共中央中南局城市工作部、中南财政经济委员会和中华全国总工会中南工作委员会等部门曾分别召开会议，检查了过去的工作并研究了增产节约的具体办法。
