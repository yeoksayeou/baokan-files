    Central People's Government Committee
    Congratulatory Telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    To Commander Peng Dehuai and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
    The 24th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee heard Commander Peng Dehuai's report on the work of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The Committee expressed complete satisfaction with the glorious achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in cooperating with the Korean People's Army to resist aggression and defend peace, and in adhering to the armistice negotiations for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on this basis, and achieving the glorious victory of the Korean armistice. The Central People's Government thanks you for your outstanding contributions in this just war and extends warm congratulations and greetings to you.
    On October 25, 1950, when the U.S. aggressor forces were launching a large-scale invasion of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and approaching the Yalu and Tumen Rivers on our northeastern border, seriously threatening our country's security, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army bravely went to Korea to support the Korean People's Army in resisting the aggression of U.S. imperialism. In the course of two years and nine months, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, upholding the will of the people of the motherland, together with the Korean People's Army, with the full support of the Chinese and Korean people, and with the warm sympathy and support of the countries of the democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world, fought tenaciously and adhered to negotiations, finally repelling the enemy's mad aggression, exposing the enemy's brutal and belligerent true face, causing the enemy to suffer serious failures militarily, politically and morally and had no choice but to accept the armistice. The achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side set a brilliant example of internationalism and patriotism for the Chinese and Korean people, demonstrated the strong unity and invincible strength of our peace and democracy camp, and won the respect and praise of progressive humanity all over the world.
    The victory of the Korean armistice fundamentally shattered the U.S. imperialists' wild plan to annex the whole of Korea and further invade our Northeast, defended the peace and security of China and Korea and the Far East, frustrated the arrogance of the aggressors, and greatly encouraged the courage and confidence of peace-loving people all over the world to strive for lasting peace and oppose wars of aggression. The Chinese people and the heroic Korean people and their armies, with their own victorious example, showed the people of the world a truth: the imperialist schemes of aggressive war must be defeated and can be defeated; as long as all peace-loving people unite, oppose interference in the internal affairs of other countries, oppose wars of aggression, and insist on resolving international disputes through peaceful negotiation, then peace can certainly be guaranteed.
    The victory of the Korean armistice is a victory for the movement of people of all countries around the world to strive for a peaceful resolution of international disputes. However, the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is only the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the spirit of the Korean people handling their own affairs still need to be negotiated and resolved by a higher-level political conference. The Chinese people have always advocated resolving international disputes through peaceful negotiation, and the Chinese people are willing to be a strong backing for the peaceful resolution of international problems.
    In view of the fact that the U.S. warmongers and the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique are carrying out various conspiracies in an attempt to obstruct and undermine the political conference and further undermine the armistice, all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army must heighten their vigilance, continue their efforts, improve their military and political level, strengthen their combat strength, further consolidate and develop the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, and work more closely with the Korean People's Army to defend their positions and prevent any aggression or provocation from the other side.
    The entire Chinese people will support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army by vigorously carrying out economic construction, strengthening national defense, and continuing to deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The government and people of the People's Republic of China will do their best to help the heroic Korean people heal the wounds of war and restore a peaceful life.
    We firmly believe that all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, under the encouragement and support of the people of the motherland, will certainly live up to the expectations of the people of the motherland, and continue to work hard to ensure the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world!
    Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea!
    Long live the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!
                Central People's Government Committee
                  September 12, 1953

### 中央人民政府委员会  给中国人民志愿军慰问电

    中央人民政府委员会
    给中国人民志愿军慰问电
    彭德怀司令员并中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    中央人民政府委员会第二十四次会议，听取了彭德怀司令员关于中国人民志愿军抗美援朝工作的报告，对于中国人民志愿军协同朝鲜人民军抵抗侵略、保卫和平的辉煌战绩及在这个基础上坚持争取和平解决朝鲜问题的停战谈判，并获得朝鲜停战的光荣胜利，表示完全满意。中央人民政府感谢你们在这一正义战争中的卓越贡献，并对你们致热烈的祝贺和慰问。
    一九五零年十月二十五日，正在美国侵略军大举侵犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并逼近我国东北边境的鸭绿江和图们江，严重地威胁我国安全的时候，中国人民志愿军英勇地开往朝鲜，支援朝鲜人民军抵抗美国帝国主义者的侵略。在两年零九个月中，中国人民志愿军秉承着祖国人民的意旨，与朝鲜人民军一道，在中朝人民的全力支援之下，在以伟大苏联为首的民主阵营各国及全世界爱好和平人民的热烈同情和支持之下，顽强战斗，坚持谈判，终于打退了敌人的疯狂侵略，揭露了敌人残暴好战的真面目，使敌人在军事上、政治上和道义上都遭受到严重失败而不得不接受停战。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战的业绩，树立了中朝人民的国际主义和爱国主义的光辉榜样，表现了我们和平民主阵营的坚强团结和不可战胜的力量，赢得了全世界进步人类的尊敬和赞誉。
    朝鲜停战的胜利，根本粉碎了美国帝国主义并吞全部朝鲜并进而侵略我国东北的狂妄计划，保卫了中朝两国及远东的和平与安全，挫败了侵略者的凶焰，大大鼓舞了全世界爱好和平人民争取持久和平、反对侵略战争的勇气和信心。中国人民和英雄的朝鲜人民及其军队一道，以自己的胜利的榜样向世界人民昭示了一个真理：帝国主义的侵略战争阴谋是必须击败和能够击败的；只要一切爱好和平的人民团结起来，反对干涉别国内政，反对侵略战争，坚持以和平协商方式解决国际问题的争端，那末，和平就一定能够得到保证。
    朝鲜停战的胜利，是全世界各国人民争取和平解决国际争端的运动的胜利。但朝鲜停战协定的签订，还只是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，朝鲜问题在朝鲜人自己处理自己问题的精神下的和平解决，尚有待于高一级的政治会议去协商解决。中国人民是一贯主张以和平协商方式解决国际争端的，中国人民愿为和平解决国际问题作坚强的后盾。
    鉴于美国好战分子和南朝鲜李承晚集团正在进行着种种预谋，企图阻挠和破坏政治会议，并进一步破坏停战，中国人民志愿军的全体同志必须提高警惕，继续努力，提高军事政治水平，加强战斗力量，进一步巩固和发展中朝两国人民的战斗友谊，更紧密地和朝鲜人民军一起坚守阵地，防止来自对方的任何侵袭和挑衅行动。
    全中国人民将以大力进行经济建设，加强国防力量，继续深入地开展抗美援朝运动，来支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。中华人民共和国政府和人民将尽力来帮助英雄的朝鲜人民医治战争创伤，恢复和平生活。
    我们深信：中国人民志愿军全体同志在祖国人民的鼓舞和支援之下，必能不负祖国人民的期望，为保障朝鲜停战协定的彻底实施，为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，为保卫远东及世界和平而继续努力！
    在抗美援朝战争中牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中朝两国人民牢不可破的永久友谊万岁！
                中央人民政府委员会
