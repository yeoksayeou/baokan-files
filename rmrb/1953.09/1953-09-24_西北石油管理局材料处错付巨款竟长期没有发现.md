    Northwest Petroleum Administration Materials Department Overpays Huge Sum, Remains Undiscovered for a Long Time
    Jin Dean of the Sales Section of Shenyang Machine Tool Factory writes: On April 28th this year, Shenyang Machine Tool Factory received a telegraphic transfer of RMB 256 million from Xi'an Jiaotong Bank and Shaanxi Branch of the People's Bank of China. Because the bank tellers were careless, the name of the paying unit was not indicated on the remittance slip. Although our factory checked everywhere, we still didn't know where the money came from. After inquiring with the Shenyang Branch of the People's Bank of China, the Shaanxi Branch of the People's Bank of China, and Xi'an Jiaotong Bank, we learned that the money was remitted by the Materials Department of the Northwest Petroleum Administration. But what did they remit this money for? We sent a letter to inquire, and it was not until September 3rd that we received a reply from the Northwest Petroleum Administration, stating that the money was payment for four lathes purchased by the Materials Department of the bureau. However, after checking, we found that the Materials Department of the bureau had ordered four lathes from our factory and paid the full amount in early May. Obviously, the bureau overpaid. What is particularly surprising is that this huge sum of money was wrongly remitted and remained undiscovered by the bureau for 126 days. This shows how serious the problems are in their financial work, and how careless and negligent the relevant staff of the bureau are. If our factory had not taken the initiative to inquire, how would they have accounted for this money?

    西北石油管理局材料处错付巨款竟长期没有发现
    沈阳机床工厂销售科金德安来信：沈阳机床工厂今年四月二十八日收到西安交通银行和中国人民银行陕西分行电汇来人民币二亿五千六百万元。因为银行开票人员工作粗枝大叶，汇款单上未注明付款单位名称，虽经我厂到处查对，还不知道款子是从那里来的。经先后向中国人民银行沈阳分行和中国人民银行陕西分行、西安交通银行查询，才知道这笔款子是由西北石油管理局材料处汇来的。可是他们汇来这笔款子干什么呢？我们又去信查问，直到九月三日才接到西北石油管理局的回信，原来这笔款是该局材料处购买四台车床的货款。可是，经我们查对，该局材料处向我厂订购的四台车床在五月初就交清了货款。显然，这笔货款是该局付重了。特别使人惊奇的是：这笔巨款汇错后经过一百二十六天，该局竟然仍未发现。可见他们的财务工作有着多么严重的问题，该局有关工作人员的工作是何等马虎大意。如果不是我厂主动查询，不知这笔款他们怎样报账呢？
