Songs of Struggle Resound on Geoje Island and Jeju Island

From August 5th to September 6th, loud and stirring songs echoed daily on the highway from Panmunjom to Kaesong. The repatriated Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, filled with excitement, sang heartily in the cars, one song after another. Many of the songs were familiar to us, but some we had never heard before; they were composed by our own prisoners of war in the POW camps. These songs were written with blood and struggle.

For more than two years, the POW camps on Geoje Island, Jeju Island, Yongcho Island, Bongam Island, and Busan echoed with the impassioned songs of our captured personnel. In their songs, they expressed their loyalty and love for the motherland, and their hatred and abhorrence for the enemy. The enemy trembled before their songs, and therefore used all kinds of violent means to deprive our captured personnel of the right to sing. Under the enemy's bloody suppression, many martyrs fell in pools of blood, and many people were stabbed, shot, and gassed by American beasts, but the songs of struggle grew ever more magnificent.

Before June 1952, most of our captured personnel were concentrated on Geoje Island, with thousands or even tens of thousands of people concentrated in one POW camp. At this time, our captured personnel often performed "ten-thousand-person choruses." As soon as the singing stopped in one POW camp, another would begin. The American military POW camp authorities set up loudspeakers in the various POW camps to carry out deceptive propaganda and broadcast American yellow music, which made our captured personnel very angry. Not long after the enemy began broadcasting, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel collectively composed a ditty against American imperialist broadcasting, entitled "Rumor Mill, Don't Listen to It!" This ditty later became a song that everyone in the Eighth POW Camp on Jeju Island knew, and became a powerful weapon against the enemy's rumors and slanders.

On February 10, 1952, the American military and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in the POW camp forced Volunteer Army prisoners of war to hold a so-called "entertainment evening." The American military and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents forced Volunteer Army prisoner of war Liu Degang to sing a reactionary song solo. However, when Liu Degang got on stage, he clenched his fists tightly, his eyes flashing with anger, and began to sing: "Arise! Ye who refuse to be slaves! With our flesh and blood, let us build our new Great Wall..." When he was almost halfway through, the people below the stage were also so excited that they began to sing along with tears in their eyes. The American military and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, who were frightened stiff, were in a state of chaos, raising their guns to threaten the captured personnel to stop singing. However, Liu Degang continued to sing passionately. The American military and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents rushed onto the stage, dragged Liu Degang down, punched and kicked him, and stuffed his mouth, which was still singing, with cloth. That very night, Liu Degang was taken to prison to be severely tortured. He fainted three times, and each time he woke up, he still trembled and continued to sing: "Arise! Ye who refuse to be slaves..."

Shortly after the start of the "Bonner Terror Period," about six thousand Volunteer Army prisoners of war were detained in the Eighth POW Camp on Jeju Island. The enemy placed them in ten camp areas separated by heavy barbed wire and open ground, attempting to disperse their fighting strength. However, they were still able to unite well and carry out struggles. Singing was one of their important means of struggle. All ten camp areas successively organized "art work teams" of more than thirty people. These art teams rehearsed dramas, living newspapers, and carried out other recreational activities with the content of encouraging fighting will. Most often, they taught each other new songs they had created themselves.

From July 1952 to July of this year, the new songs composed by the Volunteer Army prisoners of war in the Eighth POW Camp on Jeju Island that everyone learned included "Truman Lost Face Invading Korea," "Rumor Mill, Don't Listen to It!" "Love the Motherland," "Revolutionary Fighting Spirit Will Never Disappear," "Unity Song," "Strengthen Ourselves," "Celebrating the Third Anniversary of National Day," "Leaning to One Side," and other songs. In addition, they also learned to sing "Ode to Stalin," "General Kim Il-sung's Song," "Korean People's Army March," "Guerrilla Song," and "Steel Warrior" in Korean. On average, they learned to sing a new song about every half month. When they first arrived on Jeju Island, only eighty-five out of six thousand people knew how to read simplified musical notation. Later, the number of people who knew simplified musical notation increased to more than two hundred and sixty, and the new songs were taught by these people.

Our captured personnel also used tarpaulins and discarded tin cans and other waste materials to make many musical instruments such as huqin, gongs, drums, cymbals, and trumpets, which were used as accompaniment when singing. Each camp area had more than fifty huqin alone, and the ninth camp area made more than one hundred and ninety huqin.

Singing was originally a legitimate right of our captured personnel, but the Americans feared this just sound, fearing that it would enhance the patriotic thought of the prisoners of war, and often falsely accused them of singing as "riots," persecuting them with poison gas bombs, bayonets, sulfuric acid sprayers, machine guns, and starvation. On July 16, 1952, more than five hundred people in the seventh camp area of the Eighth POW Camp sang "Unity is Strength" and "Follow Chairman Mao," and the American military released a large number of poison gas bombs and sprayed sulfuric acid on them. Our captured personnel Liu Fusheng and sixteen others were seriously injured, and another ninety-six were slightly injured.

On August 15, 1952—the anniversary of the liberation of Korea—all ten camp areas of the Eighth POW Camp raised the national flag of the People's Republic of China and sang Korean and Chinese songs loudly. The American military surrounded them with ten tanks, threw a large number of poison gas bombs into the various camp areas, and sprayed sulfuric acid, injuring many people on the spot. However, when the poisonous fog and smoke enveloping the various camp areas dissipated, our captured personnel began to sing again with voices hoarse from the poison gas. The songs of thousands of people resonated. American Colonel Duweia and "Dog Captain" Brooks, who directly managed the Eighth POW Camp, also led a large group of American soldiers to the eighth camp area to prohibit the prisoners of war from singing. Our captured personnel in the eighth camp area sent representatives to negotiate with the Americans, and Brooks repeatedly shouted madly: "Singing means killing," refusing to reason with the representatives of our captured personnel. At this time, the crowd was filled with anger, and our captured personnel Li Fengji stood up and shouted:
“Comrades! Since they refuse to reason, let's continue singing!” So, six hundred people under the command of Li Fengji sang the "Motherland March" loudly. Duweia and Brooks turned purple with anger, and ordered more than ten American soldiers to drag Li Fengji out of the barbed wire. But the people in the eighth camp area were not intimidated. Instead, they sang the "Motherland March" even more passionately. Duweia and Brooks ordered the American military to brutally release the prepared poison gas bombs and concussion grenades and spray sulfuric acid, and more than sixty of our prisoners of war were seriously injured on the spot. However, when the smoke cleared, the eighth camp area, like the other camp areas, held a conference on the blood-stained square to celebrate the anniversary of the liberation of Korea. At the meeting, they unanimously passed a letter of protest to the American military, protesting the enemy's atrocities of killing prisoners of war twice on this day, and resolutely demanded the release of Li Fengji. At the same time, the captured personnel in the other nine camp areas, hearing the explosions and seeing the rising smoke, gathered separately in the square, holding hands and singing loudly to support the struggle of the eighth camp area.

Many prisoners of war were stabbed and beaten by the American military for singing while being forced to go out to do hard labor. On September 18, 1952, more than three hundred people from the eighth camp area were forced to go out to do hard labor. They sang on the construction site, and the American military circled them in an open space in the open air for seventy-two hours, without giving them food or water, and stabbed four people. On September 23, 1952, Liang Gui and twenty-five others from the second camp area were forced to go out to do hard labor. They were stabbed three times by the American military guards for singing "Love the Motherland" on the way. However, Liang Gui continued to sing this song while being dragged to the hospital.

The songs sung by our captured personnel in the POW camps during their heroic struggle fully demonstrated their loyalty to the motherland and their indomitable fighting will.

### 斗争的歌声震响在巨济岛和济州岛上

    斗争的歌声震响在巨济岛和济州岛上
    新华社记者　古凡
    从八月五日到九月六日，嘹亮激昂的歌声每天在板门店到开城的公路上震响着。遣返归来的朝中被俘人员，激动地在汽车上尽情地唱呀唱呀，一首唱完了又唱第二首。他们唱的许多歌是我们熟悉的，有些歌我们从来没有听过，那是我方被俘人员自己在战俘营中编的。这些歌曲是用鲜血和斗争写成的。
    两年多来，在巨济岛、济州岛、龙草岛、蜂岩岛和釜山等地的战俘营中，响遍了我方被俘人员慷慨激昂的歌声。他们在歌唱中表示对祖国的忠诚和热爱，对敌人的憎恶和仇恨。敌人在他们的歌声前发抖，因此，用尽各种强暴手段要剥夺我方被俘人员唱歌的权利，在敌人的血腥镇压下，许多烈士倒在血泊中，许多人被美国野兽用刺刀刺伤了，用枪击伤了，用毒气弹打伤了，但斗争的歌声越来越雄壮。
    在一九五二年六月以前，我方被俘人员大部分集中在巨济岛，几千人甚至整万人集中在一个战俘营里。这时，我方被俘人员常常作“万人大合唱”，这个战俘营的歌声刚停，那个又唱起来。美军战俘营当局在各战俘营中设立了扩音器，进行欺骗宣传，并播送美国黄色音乐，这使我方被俘人员非常气愤。敌人开始广播不久以后，中国人民志愿军被俘人员就集体创作了一首反对美帝国主义广播的小调，名为“造谣筒，不听它！”这支小调以后成为济州岛第八战俘营人人都会唱的歌，成为反对敌人造谣诬蔑的有力武器。
    一九五二年二月十日，战俘营里的美军及蒋匪特务强迫志愿军被俘人员举行所谓“娱乐晚会”，美军和蒋匪特务逼迫志愿军被俘人员刘得刚独唱反动歌曲。但是，刘得刚到了台上后，紧握双拳，眼睛里闪着愤怒的光芒，开始唱了：“起来！不愿做奴隶的人们，把我们的血肉，筑成我们新的长城……”，唱到差不多一半的时候，台下的人也激动得流着泪跟着唱起来了，在旁边吓呆了的美军及蒋匪特务乱作一团，举起手枪威胁被俘人员们停唱。但是，刘得刚仍旧激昂地唱着。美军及蒋匪特务扑上台去，把刘得刚拉下来，拳打脚踢，并用布塞住他还在发出歌声的嘴。就在这天晚上，刘得刚被拉到监狱受严刑拷打，他昏过去三次，每次醒来，仍然颤动着嘴继续唱：“起来！不愿做奴隶的人们……”。
    在“波纳恐怖时期”开始后不久，约有六千名志愿军被俘人员被拘禁在济州岛第八战俘营，敌人把他们放在用重重铁丝网和旷地隔断了的十个营场中，企图分散他们的斗争力量。然而，他们一样能很好地团结起来进行斗争。唱歌就是他们进行斗争的重要方式之一。十个营场都先后组织了三十人以上的“文艺工作队”，这些文工队排演戏剧、活报，进行其他以鼓舞斗争意志为内容的文娱活动，最经常的是教唱自己创作的新歌。
    从一九五二年七月到今年七月，济州岛第八战俘营中的志愿军被俘人员都学会了的自编的新歌，有“杜鲁门侵略朝鲜丢了脸”、“造谣筒，不听它！”、“热爱祖国”、“革命斗志永不消”、“团结歌”、“坚定自己”、“庆祝国庆节三周年”、“一边倒”等歌。此外，他们还学了用朝鲜语唱“斯大林颂”、“金日成将军之歌”、“朝鲜人民军进行曲”、“游击队之歌”、“钢铁战士”等歌曲。平均约每半个月就学会唱一支新歌。他们初到济州岛时，六千人中只有八十五人懂得看简谱，后来懂简谱的增加到二百六十多人，新歌就凭这些人教唱。
    我方被俘人员还用雨布和敌人丢弃的洋铁罐头等废物制造了胡琴、锣、鼓、钹、喇叭等许多乐器，唱歌时用来作伴奏，每个营场单是胡琴就各有五十把以上，九号营场制造了一百九十多把胡琴。
    唱歌本来是我方被俘人员的合法权利，但美方害怕这种正义的歌声，害怕这样会增强战俘的爱国思想，常常诬指他们唱歌为“暴动”，用毒气弹、刺刀、硫酸喷射器、机枪以及饥饿来迫害他们。一九五二年七月十六日，第八战俘营七号营场五百多人唱“团结就是力量”、“跟着毛泽东走”等歌，美军就向他们施放大批毒气弹和喷射硫酸，我方被俘人员刘福生等十六人负重伤，另九十六人负轻伤。
    一九五二年八月十五日——朝鲜解放纪念日，第八战俘营十个营场都升起中华人民共和国国旗并高唱朝中歌曲，美军以十辆坦克包围，向各营场投掷了大批毒气弹并喷射硫酸，当场打伤了许多人。但是，当笼罩各营场的毒雾浓烟散去后，我方被俘人员又以受了毒气刺激的沙哑的嗓子唱起歌来了。数千人的歌声震响着。美军上校杜维亚和直接管理第八战俘营的“狗大尉”布鲁克斯，又率领大队美兵赶来，到八号营场禁止战俘唱歌。八号营场我方被俘人员派代表与美方交涉，布鲁克斯连连狂叫：“唱歌就杀”，拒绝与我方被俘人员代表讲道理。这时群情激愤，我方被俘人员李风基站起来高喊：
  “同志们！他们既然拒绝讲理，我们就继续唱吧！”于是，六百人在李风基指挥下高唱起“祖国进行曲”，杜维亚和布鲁克斯气得脸色发紫，指挥十多名美军把李风基抓出铁丝网。但八号营场的人们并没有被吓住，反而更加激昂地把“祖国进行曲”唱下去。杜维亚和布鲁克斯指挥美军残暴地施放准备好了的毒气弹、震荡手榴弹并喷射硫酸，我被俘人员当场即重伤六十多人。但是，当浓烟消散后，八号营场和其他营场一样，在血染的广场上举行了庆祝朝鲜解放纪念日的大会，会上全体一致通过对美军的抗议书，抗议敌人在这天两次杀害战俘的暴行，并坚决要求释放李风基。同时，其他九个营场的我方被俘人员，听到爆炸声和看到腾起的浓烟，都分别集中在广场上手挽着手高声歌唱，支援八号营场的斗争。
    很多战俘在被迫出外做苦役时因唱歌被美军刺伤打伤。一九五二年九月十八日，八号营场三百多人被迫出外做苦役，他们在工地上唱歌，美军就把他们圈在露天下的空地上蹲了七十二小时，不给饭吃，不给水喝，并刺伤了四人。一九五二年九月二十三日，二号营场梁贵等二十五人被迫出外做苦役，因在途中唱“热爱祖国”，被看守的美军刺了三刀。但是，梁贵在被拖往病院途中，仍继续唱着这支歌。
    我方被俘人员在战俘营中进行英勇斗争时高唱的歌曲，充分表现了他们对祖国的忠诚和不屈的斗争意志。
