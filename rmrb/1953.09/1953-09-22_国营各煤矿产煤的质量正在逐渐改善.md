The quality of coal produced by state-owned coal mines nationwide has been gradually improving in recent months as attention has been paid to improving coal quality.

Since the Central Fuel Industry Ministry issued instructions on improving coal quality, leading cadres at all levels have mostly criticized the past erroneous thinking of "only pursuing output and not caring about quality," and have taken a series of necessary measures. For example, in the planning discussions at the Hegang Coal Mine, the quality aspect was a major topic of discussion in most pit mouths. At the same time, propaganda and education were carried out during shift changes or rest times using the method of detailed accounting to improve workers' understanding of quality. Quality education was also carried out on the pit surface using blackboard newspapers and catchy rhymes. The Jixi Mine implemented a "graded piece-rate wage system for raw coal," which has played a role in improving coal quality. After the Coal Mine Management Bureau issued instructions on "taking emergency measures to improve coal quality and strengthen coal washing work," the Northeast Coal Mine Administration, together with the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee and the Central Fuel Industry Ministry, organized a joint inspection team to conduct in-depth inspections and assistance in mines such as Tonghua, Yingcheng, Xi'an, Jiaohe, Hegang, and Jixi, solving many ideological, technical, and equipment problems, and introducing some advanced experiences. This work is still in progress. The North China Coal Mine Administration has also formed an inspection team with the Central Fuel Industry Ministry to focus on inspecting the coal quality improvement situation in mines such as Jingxi.

Now, from the regional coal mine administrations to the various mines, specialized coal quality management organizations have been established, and coal quality inspection teams have also been established and improved at various pit mouths. Many improvements have been made in systems or working methods in various mines, especially in the Northeast region where greater progress has been made. For example, the Fuxin mines reduced the size of the gangue sieve holes from 50 square millimeters to 35 millimeters, so that smaller gangue could also be selected. Mines such as Fushun and Benxi have established an operating system of "rapid float-sink analysis" to scientifically manage water washing machinery. The Yingcheng Mine has established a coal car plate responsibility system and a coal quality responsibility system.

In order to consolidate and continue to improve coal quality, most mines have separately convened coal washing and testing meetings to implement the "Coal Washing Regulations" and formulate a series of systems related to improving coal quality, such as the "Quality Responsibility System," "Product Inspection System," and "Quality Incentive System."

After several months of efforts, the coal quality situation of state-owned coal mines nationwide has gradually improved. For example, in the Northeast region, the coal produced in the entire region in June has already reached the quality indicators of the national plan, among which the average ash content of Hegang Bureau in the first half of the year has been lower than the rate stipulated by the state, and is still gradually improving. In July, the Huainan Mine strengthened the work of picking out gangue, and the ash content was visibly reduced. Since the Jingxi Dattai Mine launched a coal quality inspection in mid-June, the gangue content has dropped from 6.15 percent to 2.55 percent. The ash content of refined coal in the Beipiao Mine has dropped from 10 percent in January to 8 percent in July. By the end of August, the coal washing ash content of several mines such as Kailuan, Tonghua, and Fushun had been lower than planned. (Central Fuel Industry Ministry Communications Group)

### 国营各煤矿产煤的质量正在逐渐改善

    国营各煤矿产煤的质量正在逐渐改善
    全国国营煤矿，近几个月注意改进煤质以来，煤的质量情况已逐渐好转。
    国营各煤矿自中央燃料工业部发出改进煤质的指示后，各级领导干部大都对过去“只追求产量不问质量”的错误思想进行了批判，同时采取了一系列的必要措施。如鹤岗煤矿在讨论计划当中，大部坑口都将质量一项作为讨论的主要内容之一，平时利用交接班或休息时间以算细帐的方法进行宣传教育，提高了职工对质量的认识，在坑上并用黑板报、顺口溜等宣传方式进行质量教育，鸡西矿执行了“毛煤分等计件工资制”，对于提高煤质起了一定的作用。在煤矿管理总局发出“关于提高煤质，加强选煤工作采取紧急措施”的指示后，东北煤矿管理局会同东北财政经济委员会及中央燃料工业部组织联合检查组，深入通化、营城、西安、蛟河、鹤岗、鸡西等矿进行检查帮助，解决了很多思想上、技术上和设备上的问题，并介绍了一些先进经验，目前这一工作仍在进行；华北煤矿管理局也与中央燃料工业部组成了检查组，重点检查京西等矿的煤质改进情况。
    现在从大区煤矿管理局到各矿普遍建立了专管煤质的机构，各坑口也建立与健全了煤质检查小组。各矿在制度上或工作方法上都有不少改进，特别是东北区成绩较大。如阜新各矿把原来五十平方公厘大的矸石筛子眼缩小为三十五公厘的小眼，使小的矸石也能选出来；抚顺、本溪等矿都建立了“快速浮沉分析”的操作制度，科学地管理水洗机械；营城矿建立了煤车牌责任制和煤质责任制等。
    为了巩固并继续提高煤质，各矿大部已分别召开了选煤化验会议，贯彻“选煤规程”，订出“质量责任制”、“产品检查制”和“质量奖励制”等一系列有关改善煤质的制度。
    经过近几个月的努力，全国国营煤矿的煤质情况已逐渐好转。如东北区六月份全区产煤已经达到国家计划的质量指标，其中鹤岗全局平均灰分上半年已低于国家规定的比率，目前仍在逐步改进；淮南矿七月份加强了拣矸子工作，灰分显见降低；京西大台矿自六月中旬展开煤质检查后，含矸率已由百分之六·一五降至百分之二·五五；北票矿精煤的灰分由一月份的百分之十降到七月份的百分之八。至八月底，开滦、通化、抚顺等几个矿的选煤灰分都比计划降低。（中央燃料工业部通讯组）
