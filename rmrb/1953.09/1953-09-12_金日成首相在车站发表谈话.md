Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: TASS Moscow, 10th -- Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, made a speech at the train station upon arriving in Moscow. The full text is as follows:

Comrades!

Upon arriving in Moscow, the capital of the great Soviet Union – the bastion of peace and security for all nations – I extend, with infinite and profound gratitude, on behalf of the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, warm greetings to you – the entire citizens of Moscow and the entire people of the great Soviet Union.

The fraternal people of the Soviet Union not only liberated the Korean people from the long-term colonial oppression of Japanese imperialism but also provided our people with selfless assistance of all kinds, helping us build a free and happy life. During the difficult period of the three-year patriotic liberation war of the Korean people against the American interventionists and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee gang, the Soviet people, leading the freedom-loving people of the world, provided enormous assistance and support, inspiring the Korean people to fight for their freedom and independence and to achieve victory in this struggle.

Therefore, our people fully understand that friendship and solidarity with the great Soviet people has been, is, and will be one of the main factors in all the victories of the Korean people.

Our people warmly applaud the brilliant achievements made by the Soviet people under the leadership of the glorious Soviet Communist Party in carrying out the great task of building communism in your country, the purpose of which is to seek human happiness and consolidate world peace. We wish the Soviet people further victories.

The government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has come to Moscow to convey to the Soviet government the sincere gratitude of the entire Korean people for the Soviet government's decision to allocate 1 billion rubles to help the Korean people quickly restore and develop Korea's war-torn national economy, and also to discuss how to further expand and consolidate economic and cultural cooperation between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the great Soviet Union.

I am deeply convinced that this visit of the Korean government delegation to Moscow will help further consolidate the fraternal friendly relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, help to most rapidly restore and develop the devastated national economy and further consolidate the people's democratic system of our republic, and will also help to unify our motherland peacefully, and help strengthen peace and security in Asia.

Long live the unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the great Soviet people and the Korean people!

Long live the great Soviet Union – the reliable fortress of world peace and security!

    在到达伟大的苏联的首都莫斯科——各国人民的和平与安全的堡垒——时，我怀着无限深切的感激心情，谨代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团热烈地向你们——莫斯科市的全体市民和伟大苏联的全体人民致敬。
    苏联的兄弟人民不仅从日本帝国主义的长期殖民压迫下把朝鲜人民解放出来，并且给予我国人民以各种无私的援助，帮助我们建设自由和幸福的生活。在朝鲜人民反对美国干涉者及其走狗李承晚匪帮的三年爱国解放战争的困难时期中，苏联人民，领导着全世界爱好自由的人民，给予了巨大的援助和支持，鼓舞了朝鲜人民为争取他们的自由和独立而斗争，并在这个斗争中获得胜利。
    因此，我国人民完全明白，对伟大苏联人民的友谊和团结，过去是、现在也是朝鲜人民一切胜利的主要因素之一。
    我国人民热烈欢呼苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党领导下在执行在贵国建设共产主义的伟大任务中所获得的光辉成就，这个任务的目的是谋求人类幸福，巩固世界和平。我们谨祝苏联人民获得进
  一步的胜利。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团到莫斯科来，是为了向苏联政府转达全体朝鲜人民衷心的谢意，感谢苏联政府决定拨款十亿卢布援助朝鲜人民早日恢复并发展朝鲜的遭受战争破坏的国民经济，并且也为了讨论如何进一步扩大与巩固朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和伟大的苏联之间的经济与文化合作。
    我深信，朝鲜政府代表团这次到莫斯科来，将有助于进一步巩固朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟之间的兄弟般的友好关系，有助于最迅速地恢复和发展被破坏了的国民经济并进一步巩固我们共和国的人民民主制度，同时也将有助于用和平方式统一我们的祖国，有助于加强亚洲的和平与安全。
    伟大的苏联人民和朝鲜人民之间的牢不可破的友谊与团结万岁！
    全世界和平与安全的可靠堡垒——伟大的苏联万岁！
