    Beijing Suburban Farmers and State-Run Shuangqiao Farm Units etc.
    Universally Increased Yields Through Dense Planting of Wheat
    State-Run Shuangqiao and Other Farms Exceeded Semiannual Production Plans
    This year, the wheat densely planted last autumn by some farmers in the suburbs of Beijing and units such as the state-run Shuangqiao Farm has generally achieved higher yields. According to a survey by the Beijing Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, more than 12,000 mu of wheat were densely planted in the suburbs. A comparison of output from twenty typical households showed that densely planted wheat on dry land increased the average yield by 67% per mu (due to this year's even rainfall, densely planted wheat on dry land showed a particularly significant increase), on garden land the average yield increased by 40.8% per mu, and on paddy land the average yield increased by 26.3% per mu. In Baipenyao Village, Fengtai District, more than half of the village's 590 mu of wheat were densely planted. This year, the village achieved an average yield of 240 jin per mu, an increase of 33.3% compared to last year.
    The four units near Beijing: the state-run Shuangqiao Farm, the Beijing Agricultural University Farm, the state-run Wulidian Farm, and the North China Institute of Agricultural Sciences, densely planted all wheat fields, with the exception of small areas for sparse-dense comparison experiments, and all achieved high yields. Taking Shuangqiao Farm as an example, this year the average yield of densely planted wheat with a row spacing of 15 centimeters (4.5 inches) was 344.5 jin per mu; the average yield of cross-sown wheat with a row spacing of 15 centimeters was 348.1 jin per mu; the average yield of wheat with a row spacing of 7.5 centimeters (2.25 inches) was 351.45 jin per mu; and the average yield of the farm's 280 mu of wheat was 344.24 jin per mu. Compared to last year's densely planted wheat, the average yield per mu increased by 88.8%. The state-run Wulidian Farm planted 35.35 mu of densely planted wheat with a row spacing of 15 centimeters, and this year the average yield was 446.4 jin per mu. The average yield of densely planted wheat at the North China Institute of Agricultural Sciences, sown with 260,000 seeds per mu with a row spacing of 15 centimeters, was 529 jin per mu; the average yield of densely planted wheat with a row spacing of 7.5 centimeters, sown with the same amount of seed, was 555 jin per mu. At the Beijing Agricultural University Farm, the densely planted wheat in the water fields (more than 2 mu) of the Gong Wang Temple Farm on the main campus, sown using a single-foot seeder with an average row spacing of 17.5 centimeters (5.25 inches), averaged 555 jin per mu, and the dry land averaged 367 jin per mu. At the Lugouqiao Farm outside the campus, the densely planted wheat in 15 mu of water fields averaged 460 jin per mu. Although the soil quality of the farm's other 62.9 mu of dry land densely planted with wheat was very poor and little fertilizer was applied, the average yield per mu reached 254 jin, which was almost twice as high as the yield of wheat planted by local farmers using old methods. In order to exchange experiences, these units successively held seminars on high-yield dense planting of wheat before the wheat harvest, and invited farmers from nearby areas to visit the wheat fields. After the on-site visits, these farmers broke with traditional conservative ideas and understood the principle that dense planting can increase yields. For example, after visiting the densely planted wheat at the Agricultural University Farm, farmers in the 12th and 14th districts of the Beijing suburbs, combined with their years of production experience, further recognized the benefits of dense planting, and unanimously agreed that dense planting of wheat is actually "dense ridges and sparse seedlings." They unanimously agreed that dense ridges and sparse seedlings can ensure good ventilation and light transmission, allowing the wheat seedlings to grow sturdily and increase yields.
    Furthermore: The wheat, milk, and other products of the Shuangqiao, Wulidian, and Lutai farms directly under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government have all fulfilled or exceeded their semiannual production plans.
    The 280 mu of wheat at Shuangqiao Farm yielded a total of more than 96,000 jin, an increase of nearly 100% in average yield per mu compared to last year. The 560 mu of silage corn yielded 7,000 jin per mu, exceeding the planned output by 2,000 jin. The 2,000 mu of oats (for feed) yielded a total of more than 523,000 jin, exceeding the planned output by more than 20,500 jin. Milk production by dairy cows reached more than 187,900 kilograms in the first half of the year alone, exceeding the planned output by more than 8,900 kilograms. Other crops such as cotton, sweet potatoes, pasture, and sugar beets have all completed sowing tasks according to plan.
    The wheat harvested at Wulidian Farm this year averaged 330 jin per mu, exceeding the planned output of 265 jin by 25%. Relative costs were also reduced by 1%. Oats yielded 559 jin per mu, exceeding the planned output by 37%. Milk production by dairy cows totaled more than 106,000 kilograms in six months, exceeding the planned output by more than 6,000 kilograms. A total profit of more than 300 million yuan was earned.
    The wheat at Lutai Farm also completed its planned output. Rice is the farm's main crop. This year, all of the 17,000 mu of rice planted were machine-sown on dry land, completing the plan ten days ahead of schedule. Weeding, fertilization, and other tasks have now been completed according to plan, and the rice seedlings are developing well and are now heading. In six months, dairy cows produced more than 84,000 kilograms of milk, completing more than 55% of the annual plan of more than 152,000 kilograms. More importantly, the farm saved a total of more than 227.7 million yuan in production costs in the past six months.
    The achievements of the above three farms are primarily due to the promotion of democratic spirit on the basis of the anti-bureaucracy movement, which strengthened the relationship between leaders and the masses and established the idea that workers are the masters of their own affairs. As a result, workers were enthusiastic, worked actively and responsibly, and constantly improved their skills and production management. Secondly, they further studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and initially trialed the grassland-field crop rotation system, which prepared sufficient and diverse feed for livestock and continuously increased milk production. At the same time, the economic accounting system was further implemented in business management, clarifying responsibilities and division of labor. Realistic and feasible plans were formulated, and actions were taken according to the plans, ensuring the implementation of production and financial plans.
    Currently, in addition to continuing to strive to overfulfill all annual production plans, the three farms are seizing the current field management work to fight against natural disasters and strive for a bumper harvest of autumn crops, increasing grain production for the country.

    北京郊区部分农民和国营双桥农场等单位
    密植小麦普遍提高了产量
    国营双桥等农场超额完成上半年生产计划
    北京市郊区部分农民和国营双桥农场等单位去秋密植的小麦，今年普遍得到了较多的产量。据北京农林局的调查，全郊区密植小麦有一万二千多亩，据二十个典型户产量调查的对比结果：旱地密植小麦，每亩平均增产百分之六十七（由于今年雨水调匀，旱地密植小麦增产特别显著），园地每亩增产百分之四十点八，水地每亩增产百分之二十六点三。丰台区白盆窑村全村五百九十多亩小麦，因为有半数实行了密植，今年全村得到平均每亩二百四十斤的产量，比去年增产百分之三十三点三。
    北京附近的国营双桥农场，北京农业大学农场，国营五里店农场，及华北农业科学研究所四个单位，除开稀密对比小面积试验地外，全部麦地都实行了密植，同时也都得到了丰产。以双桥农场说，该场今年行距十五公分（合四点五寸）的密植小麦，每亩平均产量三百四十四点五斤；行距十五公分交叉播种的，每亩平均产量三百四十八点一斤；行距七点五公分（合二点二五寸）的每亩平均产麦三百五十一点四五斤；全场二百八十亩小麦，每亩平均产量是三百四十四点二四斤。在去年密植的基础上，每亩平均增产了百分之八十八点八。国营五里店农场，用十五公分行距条播的三十五点三五亩密植小麦，今年每亩平均产量四百四十六点四斤。华北农业科学研究所试验种植的行距十五公分每亩播种二十六万粒的密植小麦平均每亩产量五百二十九斤，行距七点五公分、播种量相同的每亩平均产量五百五十五斤。北京农业大学农场，用独脚耧播种的，行距平均十七点五公分（合五点二五寸），在校部恭王寺农场的水地（二亩多）密植小麦每亩平均产量五百五十五斤，旱地每亩平均三百六十七斤。在校外芦沟桥农场十五亩水地密植小麦每亩平均产量四百六十斤。这个农场另有六十二点九亩旱地密植小麦，虽然麦地土质很差，施肥也不多，但每亩平均产量也达二百五十四斤，比当地农民用旧法种植的小麦收成高出近倍。这些单位为了交流经验，在麦收以前先后召开了小麦密植丰产座谈会，并邀请了各单位附近地区的农民到麦地参观。这些农民经过实地参观，打破了传统的保守思想，懂得了密植可以增产的道理。如京郊十二区和十四区的农民，参观农业大学农场密植小麦后，联系自己多年的生产经验，进一步认识了密植的好处，一致认为密植小麦实际上是“密垄稀植”。一致认为垄密苗稀才能很好的通风透光，麦苗才能长得茁壮，产量才会高。
    又讯：中央人民政府农业部直属双桥、五里店、芦台三农场小麦、牛奶等都完成或超额完成上半年生产计划。
    双桥农场二百八十亩小麦，共收九万六千余斤，比去年每亩平均产量提高将近一倍。五百六十亩青贮玉米，每亩产七千斤，超过计划产量二千斤。二千亩燕麦（作饲料用）共收五十二万三千余斤，超过计划产量二万零五百余斤。乳牛产奶量，仅上半年即达十八万七千九百余公斤，超过计划产量八千九百多公斤。其他作物如棉花、甘薯、牧草、甜菜等都按计划完成播种任务。
    五里店农场今年收获的小麦，每亩平均三百三十斤，超过计划产量二百六十五斤的百分之二十五。相对的成本也降低了百分之一。燕麦每亩产五百五十九斤，超过计划产量百分之三十七。乳牛产奶量六个月共十万零六千多公斤，超过计划产量六千多公斤。共获利三亿余元。
    芦台农场的小麦也完成了计划产量。水稻是该场主要农作物，今年种的一万七千多亩水稻全部采用机器旱播，提前十天完成计划。现已按计划完成补苗、除草、施肥等工作，稻苗发育良好，现已抽穗。六个月中，乳牛产奶八万四千余公斤，完成了全年计划十五万二千多公斤的百分之五十五以上。更重要的是该场半年来在生产费用上共节约了二亿二千七百余万元。
    以上三场成绩的获得，首先是因为在反官僚主义运动的基础上，发扬了民主精神，密切了领导和群众的关系，树立起职工的当家作主思想。因而职工情绪饱满，工作积极负责，不断提高技术，改进生产管理。其次是进一步学习了苏联先进经验，初步试行牧草大田轮作制，为牲畜准备了足够的多种多样的饲料，使牛奶的产量不断提高。同时在经营管理上进一步贯彻了经济核算制，明确责任和分工。制订了切实可行的计划，按计划办事，保证了生产计划和财务计划的实施。
    目前，该三场除继续努力，争取超额完成全年各项生产计划外，正抓紧当前田间护理工作，与自然灾害作斗争，争取大秋作物的丰收，为国家增产更多的粮食。    （王启美、李春桂）
