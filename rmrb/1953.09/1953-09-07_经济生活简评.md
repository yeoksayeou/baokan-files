　　Harmful Frost Prevention Methods Should Not Be Promoted

　　September 8th marks the White Dew solar term, and early frost is about to descend in northern regions. This spring, many of our crops suffered from late frost, causing significant losses. Now, effective measures should be taken quickly to prevent early frost from harming late-autumn crops. In this spring's and previous frost prevention work, some incorrect methods were promoted in various places, which not only wasted farmers' labor but also artificially damaged crops. Everyone must learn from these lessons. For example, many places promoted the method of "pulling dew," and some cadres even went to the fields to help the masses pull dew, working from midnight until dawn, soaking their shoes, socks, and pants halfway up their legs. Such a working spirit is undoubtedly good, but the "pulling dew" method they promoted was incorrect. Some places did not have crops damaged after pulling dew, but this was only because the regional humidity was higher or the frost was lighter. Some places used crude methods to "pull dew"; the wheat seedlings were not killed by frost, but many were "pulled" to death, which is even more distressing.

　　Agricultural technologies that have not been proven effective through sufficient testing, or technologies that are occasionally "effective" but have not been repeatedly tested to confirm their "effectiveness," should not be promoted rashly. In order to earnestly improve agricultural technology, rural work cadres should strive to improve their cultural level and tirelessly learn from people with scientific knowledge at any time. When scientific knowledge is not available, for certain difficult technical problems, they can also learn more from experienced farmers, comprehensively understand past experiences, or conduct preliminary experimental research, and should not rush to promote them. Take the "pulling dew" incident as an example. If one can calmly and carefully observe the wheat fields that have been pulled for dew and the wheat fields with the same conditions that have not been "pulled for dew" to see what is different, and conduct several comparative studies, even without scientific knowledge, one can draw correct conclusions.

　　In past frost prevention efforts, experience in various places has proven that the smoke method is the most effective and scientifically sound method. However, how to make this method more effective, what should be paid attention to during use, under what circumstances can it be used, and whether there are other effective frost prevention methods, all need further systematic experimentation, research, and summarization. This is the common responsibility of rural work cadres and agricultural scientific and technical workers in various places. This is a matter directly related to the vital interests of the broad masses and should be done with full enthusiasm.

    不应推广有害的防冻方法
    九月八日就是白露，北方各地的早霜即将降临。今春我们的许多农作物遭受了晚霜的摧残，造成了重大的损失。现在应当赶快采取有效的办法，预防早霜为害晚秋作物。今春和以往的防霜工作中，各地曾推广了一些不正确的方法，不但徒然浪费了农民的劳动力，反而人为地损害了农作物。大家必须接受这些教训。像许多地方推行了“拉露水”的防冻方法，有些干部还亲自下地帮助群众拉，从半夜一直拉到天快亮，把鞋袜和半截裤子都湿透了。这样的工作精神无疑是很好的，但是，他们所推行的这种“拉露水”的方法却是不对的。有些地方拉了露水之后庄稼没有受冻，其实只是因为地区湿度较大或者冻得较轻。有的地方用粗暴的办法“拉露水”；麦苗并没有冻死，却被“拉”死了很多，这就更令人痛心了。
    对于没有经过充分的试验证明确实有效的农业技术，或者对于一种偶尔“行之有效”但也没有反复试验证实其“效果”的技术，都不应该贸然推广。为了认真地作好改进农业技术的工作，农村工作干部应该努力提高自己的文化水平，不厌其烦地随时向懂得科学知识的人学习。在科学知识还不具备的时候，对于某些疑难的技术问题，还可多向老农学习，全面地了解过去的经验，或者先行实验研究，不要急于推广。就拿“拉露水”这件事来说吧，如果能够冷静地仔细观察拉过露水的麦田和没有“拉露水”的同样条件的麦田究竟有什么不同，反复进行几次比较研究，即使没有科学知识，也是能够得出正确的结论的。
    在过去防冻中，各地经验都证明了熏烟法是最有效的方法，也是合乎科学道理的。可是这个方法究竟怎样才能更有效，在使用中应当注意些什么，在什么情况下才能使用，是否还有其它有效的防霜办法，都还有待进一步系统地实验、研究、总结。这是各地农村工作干部和农业科学技术工作者共同的责任。这是一件和广大群众切身利益有直接关系的事情，应当用充沛的热情把它做好。
