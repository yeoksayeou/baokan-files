Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Central People's Government, Ministry of Heavy Industry, Industrial Education Division's letter: The reader's criticism in the August 5th "Summary of Readers' Letters" column regarding the serious printing errors in the "Mechanical Parts Handbook" published by our division is correct. After our inspection, in the 278 pages of the book, in addition to the 83 errors that have already been corrected, there are still 154 errors such as skewed diagrams, missing characters, and other errors, some of which can cause errors in engineering calculations. The main reasons for these errors are: we did not pay enough attention to the quality of publication and did not clearly define a proofreading responsibility system. In order to correct this phenomenon, we have decided to establish a publication quality responsibility system and have begun to check the printing quality of all books published in the past. If the errors are serious, we will take appropriate measures to remedy them. We have decided to reprint the "Mechanical Parts Handbook" and exchange it for the books that have already been sold; the exchange date and method will be announced in Guangming Daily. Su

    中央重工业部工业教育司决定重印“机械零件手册”
    中央人民政府重工业部工业教育司来信：八月五日“读者来信摘要”栏中，读者对我司出版的“机械零件手册”一书印刷有严重错误的批评是正确的。经我们检查，该书二百七十八页中除已勘误的八十三处错误外，还有图歪、掉字及其他错误一百五十四处，其中有的错误可以引起工程计算上的错误。造成这些错误的主要原因是：我们对出版质量重视不够，没有明确校对责任制。为了纠正这种现象，我们已决定建立出版质量责任制，并着手检查过去出版的全部书籍的印刷质量，错误严重者将采取适当办法进行补救。“机械零件手册”一书，我们已决定重印，并换回已经卖出的书籍；调换日期和办法将在光明日报公布。宿
