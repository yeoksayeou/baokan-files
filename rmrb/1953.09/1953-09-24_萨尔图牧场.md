    Sartu Ranch
    By Our Correspondent Fang Qing
    West of Harbin, on the north bank of the Songhua River, lies a natural pastureland stretching for hundreds of miles.

    The state-owned Sartu Livestock Farm is located in the center of this natural pasture. It has 1,150 cattle, including 585 adult dairy cows. Besides raising calves, they produce nearly five tons of milk daily. After processing, the milk is made into butter, cheese, and milk powder, continuously supplying the needs of the people.

    This farm was established in 1947. By learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and improving breeding management, the milk production of each healthy dairy cow increased from 2,004 kilograms in 1948 to 3,564 kilograms in 1952. I interviewed Comrade Yao Shusen, a herdsman. He has fifteen years of experience, starting at the age of fifteen, working for landlords to graze dairy cows. Because of his long-term life with cattle, plus careful observation, he can understand their needs from their various movements and sounds. Especially after Yao Shusen received the education of the Communist Party and became a herdsman in the state-owned farm, he devoted himself entirely to the cattle. When the cows are grazing in the pasture, he carefully observes which type of cow likes to eat which kind of grass; when the cows are resting, he immediately goes to the nearby pasture to find the grass that the cows love to eat. Last summer, when it was hot and there were many mosquitoes, he proposed night grazing; in January of this year, he felt that the winter nights were long and proposed night watering (the widespread promotion of the latter method increased milk production by 5%). He anticipates the arrival of storms and brings the cattle back in advance; he has never beaten the cows, nor has he ever shouted at them, for fear of disturbing them. At the same time, he spends all his free time cleaning the cowsheds and washing the cows, all in order to make the cows live well, maintain their peace and happiness, and increase milk production.

    In order to develop the livestock industry, this farm, based on the original 450 hectares of cultivated land, has reclaimed another 500 hectares this year, planting alfalfa and various succulent feeds. In five years, there will be 2,500 hectares of cultivated land serving animal husbandry. At that time, this farm will maintain 900 adult dairy cows and 2,000 adult ewes, so that 400 adult dairy cows and 1,000 adult ewes can be transferred out each year to establish more and better farms.

    萨尔图牧场
    本报记者　方青
    从哈尔滨市往西，松花江北岸，是一片纵横数百里的天然牧场。
    国营萨尔图畜牧农场就在这一片天然牧场的中央。有一千一百五十头牛，其中成年乳牛五百八十五头，除了养育幼犊外，每天产乳将近五吨，经过加工，制成奶油、干酪、乳粉，源源不断地供给人民的需要。
    这个牧场，是一九四七年建立的，因为学习了苏联的先进经验，改进了饲养管理，使得每一头健康的乳牛，从一九四八年产奶二千零四公斤，增加到一九五二年的三千五百六十四公斤。我访问了牧工姚树森同志。他从十五岁就给地主放乳牛，到现在已有十五年的经验了。因为长期和牛在一起生活，再加上细心观察，他能够从牛的各种动作和声音中，体会到它有什么要求。特别是当姚树森接受了共产党的教育，并且成为国营牧场的牧工的时候，更把全副身心都放在牛身上。牛在草地里吃草，他细心地察看哪一种牛喜欢吃什么草；牛休息的时候，他马上就到附近草地里去找那些牛所爱吃的草。去年夏天天热，蚊子多，他便提出夜牧；今年一月份他又感到冬季夜长，提出了夜饮（由于后一办法的普遍推广，使产乳量增加了百分之五）。他估计暴风雨要来，便提前把牛赶回来；他不但没有打过牛，从来都没有高声吆喝过牛，怕惊扰它们。同时，他把所有空闲时间都放在清扫牛舍，涮洗牛身等工作上，这一切都是为着使牛生活得好，保持它们的安静和愉快，以提高乳量。
    为了发展畜牧事业，这个牧场在原有四百五十公顷熟地的基础上，今年又开荒五百公顷，种苜蓿和各种多汁饲料。五年后，将有二千五百公顷熟地为牧业服务。那时，这个牧场将保持九百头成年乳牛，二千只成年母羊，这样每年就可以调出成年乳牛四百头，成年母羊一千只，去建立更多更好的牧场。
