In the Season of Autumn Harvest

    Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative Begins Picking New Cotton

    The nationally famous cotton high-yield model, Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative, comprehensively improved its techniques this year, overcame drought and pests, and the 88.6 mu of cotton seedlings across the cooperative are generally growing well. Now, the cotton seedlings have grown to 2.5 to 3 feet tall, with an average of 13 or 14 fruit branches per plant, and 12 or 13 cotton bolls. The early-maturing dryland cotton seedlings are already splitting their bolls and producing cotton, blossoming profusely. The cooperative has now begun picking the new cotton. Barring unforeseen disasters, the cooperative is expected to have a bumper cotton harvest this year.

    In order to strive for a bumper cotton harvest, the Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative continuously carried out pest control work this year. From July 6th to August 28th alone, they conducted pest control six times, greatly reducing the extent of damage to cotton seedlings this year compared to last year. They also attached particular importance to mid-cultivation and weeding in the cotton fields. Since the beginning of summer, they have carried out shallow hoeing after each rainfall. In addition, they paid attention to techniques in fertilization, cotton topping, and cotton field irrigation, so that the cotton seedlings grew strong and reduced the phenomenon of boll and bud drop. The members of the Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative are continuing to work intensively on irrigation, pest control, and stripping of secondary buds, actively striving for a comprehensive bumper cotton harvest this year.

    Harnessing the Huai River Achieves Results, Bumper Harvest Along the Hong River

    The crops along the Hong River in southern Henan are growing very well, and the early autumn sorghum has generally begun to be harvested, with yields generally stronger than last year. Local people say that this is a large-scale bumper harvest that has not been seen since liberation. The reason why the Hong River area can achieve such a bumper harvest is that the Huai River harnessing project has achieved results. The Hong River was originally the most harmful river in the history of the people of southern Henan, flowing through seven counties including Xiping and Suiping, and entering the Huai River in Huai'bin. After the Huai River harnessing project started in the winter of 1950, the Shi'mantan Reservoir, the Banqiao Reservoir, and the Lao Wangban depression flood storage project were successively built in the upper reaches of the Hong River, effectively intercepting the torrential mountain floods flowing from the mountains in the upper reaches of the Hong River. This spring, the main stream of the Hong River underwent active efforts by 330,000 migrant workers, completing 14.5 million cubic meters of earthwork, which facilitated the smooth drainage of river water. Before the summer flood season this year, in order to completely overcome floods, the Xinyang Prefectural Flood Control Headquarters mobilized the masses to complete more than 400,000 cubic meters of earthwork left over from the spring project of the Hong River, and prepared relatively sufficient flood control equipment. As a result of the above preparations, although there were rainstorms in the Hong River basin in early August this year, it was guaranteed that the dikes along the river would not collapse, break, or overflow, so that the crops along the river were basically spared from flood attacks.

    Leading Farmers in Disaster Areas to Rush Harvest Lodged Rice

    In some areas of Luxian, Quxian, Jingyan, Longchang, and Fushun counties in Sichuan Province, varying degrees of rainstorms were encountered before and during the autumn harvest, and a lot of rice was lodged and sprouted. Party and government leading organs in various places have successively tried to lead farmers in disaster areas to rush to harvest. After the occurrence of wind and rain disasters, the cadres of various districts and townships in Luxian County redeployed and organized labor according to the new situation of millet lodging and sprouting, and carried out rush harvesting. After Changhe Township, Jingyan County, was suddenly attacked by rainstorms, the township cadres went to various villages overnight to understand the situation and mobilized farmers to rush to harvest and rescue, so the degree of food damage was greatly reduced.

    Emei White Wax and Guizhou Tobacco Both Have a Bumper Harvest

    The nationally renowned Sichuan Emei white wax has achieved a bumper harvest this year, the best in thirteen years.

    White wax is one of Emei's main specialties, and its output accounts for 85% of the output in southern Sichuan. The local People's Bank has successively loaned more than 1.6 billion yuan last year and this year to solve the problem of wax farmers lacking funds for wax production, and wax farmers' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. From the "Start of Summer" to the "Grain Full" season, wax insects were all hung on the trees, and management work was also improved. Therefore, this year's white wax secretion is good, and each package can produce up to five catties, an increase of 50% compared to last year. At present, Emei County Trading Company is actively purchasing according to farmers' requirements. Because the purchase price is reasonably set, wax farmers are very satisfied.

    Guizhou Province has a bumper harvest of flue-cured tobacco. This year, the tobacco plants in the tobacco producing areas of the area are growing better than last year, with glossy leaves and large, plump leaves. According to estimates by the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the average yield per mu can reach about 120 jin. The average yield per mu in Guiding, Fuquan and other counties is more than 130 jin; the average yield per mu in Xinpu Village, Guiding County, is nearly 200 jin, and the average yield per mu in the Yang Zhongchen mutual aid group is about 250 jin. There are more than 20 households in the village with a yield of more than 300 jin per mu. Now, except for Huishui County, which has not yet started harvesting due to late planting, farmers in other places are intensively harvesting and baking.

    In order to do a good job in the purchase of tobacco leaves in 1953, the Finance and Economics Committee of the People's Government of Guizhou Province recently sent three flue-cured tobacco teams to 15 key producing areas such as Guiding, Longli, and Wengan to conduct inspections and assistance work.

    Putian Longan in Fujian Province May Increase by 20%

    The famous longan in Putian County, Fujian Province has begun to be harvested. It is estimated that this year's output can increase by 20% compared with 1951 (a bumper year). Fruit farmers in various townships in the producing area are celebrating the bumper harvest with joy.

    This year is a bumper year for Putian longan. It is estimated that it can produce more than 24 million jin, which can be used to bake more than 6.5 million jin of dried longan. The quality of longan has also improved compared to the past. After processing and baking the harvested longan, the specifications are generally better than in the past. In order to open up the sales of longan, the Putian County Cooperative General Agency has established a dried longan processing factory in Hanjiang, and signed purchase and processing contracts with the Provincial Cooperative General Agency and cooperative agencies in Jiangxi, Zhejiang and other provinces. Mass purchases will soon be made in the county's five main producing areas.

    Farmers in Qinghai Province Begin Autumn Harvest

    Since August, crops such as Qingke barley, wheat, and beans in Qinghai Province have matured one after another. Harvesting has begun for many days in warmer areas. Now the focus of the autumn harvest has shifted to the mountainous areas. The cultivated land area in these areas accounts for four-fifths of the total cultivated land. In order to ensure the harvest of grain, farmers in the province are carrying out rush harvesting and disaster prevention according to the different conditions in various places.

    Actively Prepare for Winter Production

    Hucheng Dike in the Second District of Hanshou County, Hunan Province, is the largest dike in the county, with more than 51,600 mu of land. This year, early rice, middle rice, high-field, and low-field have all had bumper harvests. Nanzhang'er, which used to have poor harvests nine years out of ten, also harvested 600 jin of grain per mu. The families in the dike piled up baskets of yellow grain, filling the halls, and people were so happy they couldn't close their mouths. Before liberation, Hucheng Dike was either breached or flooded every year and never had a good harvest. After liberation, the People's Government led the repair of the dike, but it still collapsed and leaked for three or four years. Last year and this year, the People's Government led the people to completely repair the embankment, which guaranteed this year's unprecedented bumper harvest. The farmers of Hucheng Dike are now continuing to apply topdressing fertilizer and striving for a bumper harvest of late rice. Many masses have made covenants to prevent livestock from eating and trampling on the crops. Some farmers are rushing to plant buckwheat and radish seeds, striving to harvest more grain in addition to the bumper harvest. Some farmers are already preparing for winter production. Zou Dongsheng from Huanghaiping Township bought 200 camphor and miscellaneous wood and hired carpenters to build boats and repair farm tools. He said: "The government has helped us up, and after getting a bumper harvest, we still have to calculate carefully, get a boat to fish, save some grain, do a good job in production next year, and continue to strive for a bumper harvest."

    在秋收的季节里
    曲耀离农业生产合作社开始采摘新棉
    全国著名的棉花丰产模范曲耀离农业生产合作社，今年全面地改进了技术，战胜了旱灾和虫害，全社八十八亩六分棉苗普遍生长良好。现在，棉苗已经长至二尺五寸到三尺高，每株平均十三四个果枝，每株结桃十二三个，早熟的旱地棉苗正裂桃吐絮，朵朵开花。现该社已开始采摘新花。今后如无意外灾害，全社棉花可望丰收。
    曲耀离农业生产合作社为了争取棉花丰收，今年连续进行了治虫工作，只是从七月六日到八月二十八日之间，就治虫六次，使今年棉苗受害程度比去年大为减轻。他们还特别重视棉田的中耕除草工作，入夏以来，每次落雨后都进行一次浅锄。此外，对于施肥、棉花打切、棉地浇水等工作，都讲求技术，使棉苗生长健旺，减少了落铃落蕾的现象。曲耀离农业生产合作社的社员们，正继续紧张地进行浇水、除虫、剥次芽等工作，积极争取今年棉花全面丰收。（李逸民）
    治淮收到功效洪河沿岸丰收
    河南南部洪河沿岸庄稼长得很好，早秋高粱已经普遍开始收割，产量一般比去年强。当地群众说，这是解放以来所没有的大面积丰收。洪河沿岸能够得到这样丰收，是因为治淮工程收到了功效。洪河本来是河南南部人民历史上为害最大的河流，流经西平、遂平等七县，到淮滨境入淮河。一九五零年冬天治淮工程开始以后，洪河上游先后兴修了石漫滩水库、板桥水库、老王板洼地蓄洪工程，有效地拦蓄了洪河上游从高山流下的湍急山洪；今年春天洪河干流经过了三十三万民工积极努力兴修，完成了一千四百五十万土方的工程，便利了河水通畅排泄。今年夏汛前，为彻底战胜洪水，信阳专区防汛指挥部又动员群众突击完成洪河春工遗留下的四十多万土方，并准备了较充分的防汛器材。由于进行了以上的准备工作，今年八月初洪河流域虽有暴雨，也保证了沿河堤防不溃、不决、不漫溢，使沿河庄稼基本免除了水灾袭击。
    领导灾区农民抢收倒伏水稻
    四川省泸县、渠县、井研、隆昌、富顺等县部分地区，在秋收前和秋收中，遭到了不同程度的暴风雨的袭击，水稻倒伏、生芽的很多。各地党、政领导机关，纷纷设法领导受灾地区的农民进行抢收。泸县各区乡干部，根据风雨灾害发生后，谷子倒伏、生芽的新情况，重新调配和组织了劳动力，进行抢收。井研县长河乡在突遭暴风雨的袭击以后，乡干部就连夜到各村了解情况，动员农民抢收和抢救，因而粮食受损程度大为减轻。
    峨眉白蜡、贵州菸叶都丰收
    全国闻名的四川峨眉白蜡，今年获得十三年来没有过的丰收。
    白蜡是峨眉的主要特产之一，产量占川南地区产量百分之八十五。该地人民银行曾在去年和今年先后贷款十六亿多元，解决了蜡农缺少挂蜡资金的问题，蜡农生产积极性大大提高。从“立夏”到“小满”季节，蜡虫都挂上了树，管理工作也有改进。因此，今年白蜡分泌良好，每包最多产到五斤，比去年增产百分之五十。目前，峨眉县贸易公司根据农民要求，正积极收购。由于收购价格订得比较合理，蜡农们很满意。
    贵州省烤菸丰收。今年该区各产菸区的菸株长得都比去年好，叶色光泽，叶片丰硕肥大。据省农林厅估计，每亩平均产量可达一百二十斤左右。贵定、福泉等县每亩产量平均都在一百三十斤以上；贵定县新铺村每亩平均产量将近二百斤，杨仲臣互助组每亩平均产量二百五十斤左右，该村每亩产三百斤以上的有二十户以上。现在除惠水县因栽得较晚尚未开始收割外，其他各地农民，正紧张地进行收割、烘烤。
    贵州省人民政府财政经济委员会，为了做好一九五三年的菸叶收购工作，于最近派出三个烤菸组，分赴贵定、龙里、瓮安等十五个重点产区，巡回进行检查和帮助工作。
    福建莆田龙眼约可增产二成
    著名的福建省莆田县的龙眼已开始采摘，估计今年可比一九五一年（大年）增产两成，产区各乡果农正满怀喜悦地欢庆丰收。
    今年是莆田龙眼的大产年，估计可产两千四百多万斤，可焙制桂圆干六百五十多万斤。龙眼质量也较过去提高，已采摘的龙眼加工焙制后，规格多比过去好。莆田县合作总社为打开龙眼销路，已在涵江设立桂圆加工厂，并通过省合作总社和江西、浙江等省合作社签订代购和加工合同，最近即将在全县五个主要产区大量收购。
    青海省农民开始秋收
    青海省八月以来，青裸、麦子、豆子等作物已陆续成熟，较暖的地方已开始收割多日。现在秋收重心已转到山区。这些地区耕地面积占全部耕地五分之四，该省农民为了保证粮食的收获量，正在针对各地不同情况，进行抢收和防灾。
    积极准备冬季生产
    湖南汉寿县二区护城垸是该县最大的一个垸子，有五万一千六百多亩田，今年早稻、中稻、高田、低田都普遍丰收。十年九不收的南漳儿，每亩地也收了六百斤谷子。垸子里的人家，萝筐垒萝筐，黄澄澄的谷子堆满了堂屋，人们都高兴得合不拢嘴。护城垸的垸子在解放前年年不是溃就是渍，没有过好收成。解放以后，人民政府领导修整垸子，但三、四年来还是不免崩垮、浸漏；去年和今年人民政府又领导人民彻底整修了堤岸，才保障了今年的空前丰收。护城垸子农民现在正在继续追肥，争取晚稻的丰收，许多群众订出了公约，防止牲畜吃踏。有些农民在赶种荞麦、萝卜种，争取丰收之外，再多收粮食。有些农民已经在准备冬季生产了，黄海坪乡邹冬生买了二百根樟木和杂木，请木匠造船和修农具，他说：“政府把俺扶起来，得了丰收还要细算点，置个船打鱼，节省点谷子，明年搞好生产，继续争取丰收。”（刘碧兰、肖晋）
