Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd. Our correspondent Wu Min reports: The US side's open support for and assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek gang's sabotage of the implementation of the armistice agreement and its criminal acts of forcibly detaining Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war can be further evidenced by the recent blatant permission and assistance given by the US military authorities to the Chiang Kai-shek air force's conspiratorial activities in South Korea.

It is learned here that the US military authorities permitted and assisted several Chiang Kai-shek air force planes to carry a so-called delegation dispatched by Chiang Kai-shek, led by the special agent ringleader Fang Zhi, and a large number of so-called gifts that insulted the dignity of our prisoners of war, to land continuously at the US military airfield on Jeju Island on August 26th and 27th. At the same time, in order to cooperate with the Chiang Kai-shek special agent ringleader's planning of a larger-scale criminal conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war within its prisoner of war camps, the US Air Force also openly approved the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force's dispatch of aircraft to conduct reactionary propaganda over the prisoner of war camps on Jeju Island where Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated were detained, attempting to coerce our prisoners of war to comply with the Chiang Kai-shek special agent ringleader's conspiracy and abandon their right to be repatriated.

Despite this, the US prisoner of war camp authorities issued a statement on the 31st attempting to shirk the serious responsibility of their superiors for supporting and assisting the Chiang Kai-shek gang's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. The statement shamelessly repeated the lies fabricated by the US side, saying that prisoners of war expressed "fear" of being sent to the demilitarized zone near the Korean-Chinese side, and that the Chiang Kai-shek gang sent a delegation composed of special agents to the prisoner of war camp to request the prisoners of war to "cooperate during the transfer to the demilitarized zone." However, the statement never dared to reveal the detailed activities of these Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the prisoner of war camp in recent days. Everyone knows that, with the intensified support and assistance of the US side, the first step of the Chiang Kai-shek special agents' conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war is to attempt to obstruct and sabotage the transfer of prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, so as to smoothly forcibly detain them. And the so-called prisoner of war "refusal" to be sent to the demilitarized zone is just an absurd excuse created by Chiang Kai-shek special agents attempting to directly sabotage the armistice agreement and obstruct the transfer of prisoners of war to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Now, the US prisoner of war camp authorities are actually using the criminal behavior of the Chiang Kai-shek gang to prove that the Chiang Kai-shek gang is not a criminal, which is difficult to conceal.

From all indications, the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gang special agents in the US prisoner of war camps are intensifying their conspiracy to obstruct and sabotage the transfer of prisoners of war to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. According to Agence France-Presse, the US side has repeatedly released rumors for Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents, saying that Chinese People's Volunteer Army and Korean People's Army prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated are "strongly opposed" to being transferred to the custody of Indian troops and to the explanatory work of the Korean-Chinese side. The report also said that "reliable sources" in Seoul maliciously released rumors, saying that "the demilitarized zone is only a stone's throw away from the Communist-controlled land," and that "disturbances may immediately follow" after the prisoners of war are transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The purpose of such rumors is obviously to prepare for the destructive activities of the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents after the prisoners of war are transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, so as to shift the responsibility for these destructive activities to the Korean-Chinese side.

    美方公开支持蒋匪扣留我志愿军被俘人员
    阴谋阻挠把战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会
    【新华社开城三日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：美方公开支持和协助蒋匪帮破坏停战协定的实施和强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员的罪恶行为，可从最近美军当局公然准许和协助蒋匪空军在南朝鲜的阴谋活动得到新的证明。
    据此间获悉，美军当局曾准许和协助蒋匪空军飞机多架，载运蒋匪派遣的由特务头子方治率领的所谓代表团，及大批侮辱我方被俘人员尊严的所谓礼物，于八月二十六日和二十七日连续在美军济州岛飞机场降落。同时，为了配合蒋匪特务头子在其战俘营内策划更大规模的强迫扣留战俘的罪恶阴谋，美空军还公然批准蒋匪空军派出飞机在济州岛拘禁不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的战俘营上空进行反动宣传，企图胁迫我方被俘人员顺从蒋匪特务头子的阴谋，放弃被遣返的权利。
    尽管如此，美方战俘营当局却在三十一日，发表了企图为它的上司推卸支持和协助蒋匪帮强迫扣留战俘阴谋的严重责任的声明。声明厚颜无耻地重复美方捏造的谎言，说甚么战俘对被送到接近朝中方面地区的非军事区去表示“畏惧”，蒋匪帮派遣特务头子组成的代表团到战俘营去，是为了要求战俘“在被移往非军事区时进行合作”。但是，声明始终不敢透露这些蒋匪特务头子几天来在战俘营内活动的详细情形。谁都知道，在美方的加紧支持和协助下，蒋匪特务强迫扣留战俘的第一步阴谋就是企图阻挠和破坏把不直接遣返的战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管，以便顺利地强迫扣留他们。而所谓战俘“拒绝”被送到非军事区去，只是蒋匪特务企图直接破坏停战协定，阻挠把战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管，而制造出来的一个荒谬藉口。现在，美方战俘营当局居然以蒋匪帮的罪犯行为来证明蒋匪帮不是罪犯，是很难掩饰过去的。
    从一切迹象看来，美方战俘营里的蒋介石和李承晚匪帮特务分子，企图阻挠和破坏把战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会的阴谋正在加紧进行中。据法新社报道，美方接连替蒋李特务放出谣言，说甚么不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军被俘人员“强烈反对”移交给印度军队看管和朝中方面的解释工作。报道还说，汉城方面的“可靠人士”用心险恶地放出谣言，说甚么“非军事区离共产党控制的土地只有一箭之遥”，在战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管以后“可能马上接着发生骚动”。这类谣言的目的显然是为蒋李特务在战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会以后进行破坏活动预作准备，以便把这些破坏活动的责任推卸在朝中方面身上。
