    On August 9th, at 9:30 PM, the People's Government of Dading County, Guizhou Province, received a telegram from the Bijie Prefectural Commissioner's Office. It stated:
    "Please report immediately the number of households in your county lacking grain during the spring famine (up to the end of June), along with the amount of grain and funds disbursed for various relief efforts (including rural and urban relief, short- and long-term subsidies for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, grain storage), free lending, purchase of local products, transportation, etc., and the effectiveness (number of households helped), to the Commissioner's Office."
    The telegram stated "report immediately to the Commissioner's Office," but it was already too late that night. The next day, county leaders summoned personnel from the bank, county cooperative, grain bureau, county committee research group, production office, civil affairs department, and financial committee to fill in the numbers requested in the telegram. When the comrades from each department saw the telegram, they started discussing it. The comrades from the bank said, "The loan figures for the first half of the year were already reported to the Bijie Central Branch and the Prefectural Financial Committee. Why don't they just ask them nearby?" The comrades from the grain bureau said:
    "We already reported that we lent 1.2 million jin of grain interest-free in the first half of the year. Why are they still asking?" In addition, the comrades from the civil affairs department and the county cooperative also said that the numbers they were asking for had already been reported to the Prefectural Civil Affairs Department and the Prefectural Cooperative. Moreover, everyone felt that since the summer famine had passed, what was the great use of still counting the number of households lacking grain during the spring famine?
    Nevertheless, everyone still carried out the instructions. After compiling the materials requested by the Prefectural Commissioner's Office, the county production office called the Prefectural Production Office to make contact. However, the comrades from the Prefectural Production Office said that these numbers were not what they wanted, and that they would ask the Prefectural Civil Affairs Department. After that, there was no response.
    A telegram that was originally supposed to be "reported immediately to the Commissioner's Office" has now turned into a "no one cares" telegram.
    Editor's Note: Who exactly sent this telegram? Why was such a telegram sent? We hope the Bijie Prefectural Commissioner's Office will investigate and inform us.

    一封电报
    邹兴政
    八月九日，已经是晚上九点半钟了，贵州省大定县人民政府接到毕节专署打来的一封电报。上面说：
    “希将你县在春荒中（截至六月底止）缺粮人户数，与发放各项救济（包括农村城市救济、烈军属长短期补助、积谷）及开展自由借贷，收购土特产，运输等，共发放多少粮款和投出的资金及成效（多少人户）等数字，即日报署。”
    电报中说的是要“即日报署”，但是，当夜已经来不及了。第二天，县领导方面召集了银行、县联社、粮食局、县委研究组、生产办公室、民政科、财委会等部门的人，来填写这封电报里所要的数字。各部门同志把这封电报一看，大家就议论开了。银行的同志说：“上半年贷放数字，早已报到毕节中心支行和专署财委了，他们为什么不就近向那边要？”粮食局的同志说：
    “我们上半年无息贷粮一百二十万斤，早已呈报过，为什么还来问？”此外，民政科的同志和县联社的同志，也都说现在所要的数字，他们都上报过专署民政科和专署联社了。而且，大家觉得，现在夏荒已过，又来统计春荒缺粮户数，这有什么大用处呢？
    虽然如此，大家还是照样执行了。把专署所要材料整理好以后，县生产办公室就给专署生产办公室打电话联系。但是，专署生产办公室的同志却说，这个数字不是他们要的，他去问问专署民政科。此后，就没有答复了。
    一封原来要“即日报署”的电报，现在又一变而为“无人过问”的电报了。
    编者按：这封电报究竟是什么人发的？为什么要发这样的电报？希望毕节专署检查后告诉我们。
