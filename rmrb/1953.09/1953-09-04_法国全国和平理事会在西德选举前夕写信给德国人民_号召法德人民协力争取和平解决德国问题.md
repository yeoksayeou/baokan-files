Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 2nd: On the eve of the West German elections, the Standing Committee of the French National Peace Council wrote a letter to the German people. The letter stated: "We firmly believe that European peace cannot be guaranteed without the participation of the German people. The greatest wish of the French people is to coexist peacefully with a tranquil Europe and its neighbors." The letter also stated: "The arms race has never been the road to peace. Militarization has never led to freedom and international harmony. The infamous European Defense Community will allow foreign troops to remain in your and our territories for a long time; it will make it impossible for Germany to reunify; it will place an unbearable burden on the shoulders of our two peoples. The revival of German militarist forces will re-ignite an atmosphere of mutual suspicion among nations. It may once again plunge Europe and the entire world into war.

    "The vast majority of the French people oppose the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, and are determined to reject these treaties. However, a peaceful solution to the German question is not possible without the approval of the German people. Therefore, the French people sincerely hope that the German people will choose the path of negotiation. Only this path can guarantee the establishment of a democratic Germany, and guarantee Germany's independence, unity, and peace."

    法国全国和平理事会在西德选举前夕写信给德国人民
    号召法德人民协力争取和平解决德国问题
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二日讯：在西德大选前夕，法国全国和平理事会常设委员会写信给德国人民。信中说：“我们深信，如果没有德国人民参加，欧洲和平就不可能得到保证。法国人民的最大愿望是：在安宁的欧洲和它的邻国和平共处。”信中又说：“军备竞赛从来就不是走向和平的道路。军国主义化从未导向自由与国际和睦共处。臭名远扬的欧洲防务集团要使外国军队长久留驻在你们和我们的领土上；它要使德国没有可能重归统一；它要把不可忍受的重担加在我们两国人民的肩上。德国军国主义势力的复活会重新引起民族间互相猜疑的空气。它可能再把欧洲和整个世界投入战争。
    “绝大多数法国人民反对波恩条约和巴黎条约，并且决心要拒绝这些条约。但是，如果得不到德国人民的赞同，和平解决德国问题就不可能实现。因此，法国人民诚挚希望德国人民选择协商的道路。只有这条道路才能保证建立一个民主的德国，保证德国的独立、统一与和平。”
