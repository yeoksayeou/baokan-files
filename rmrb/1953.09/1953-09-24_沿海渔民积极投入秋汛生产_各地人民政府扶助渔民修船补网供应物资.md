Coastal fishermen in Guangdong, Shandong, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang are actively engaged in autumn fishing season production. Fishermen in coastal areas of Guangdong Province are actively repairing boats and mending nets, welcoming a greater harvest during the autumn peak season. Currently, many trawling fishing boats have gathered in fishing grounds such as Wanshan outside the Pearl River Estuary and Shanwei and Aotou ports to fish. The fish spawning season in eastern and western Guangdong is also approaching, and local fishermen using seine nets will soon complete their preparations before going out to sea.

This year, fishermen's political power was established and democratic reforms were carried out in the coastal areas of Guangdong Province, greatly increasing fishermen's enthusiasm for production. During the off-season, the People's Government earnestly resolved the fishermen's livelihood difficulties, helped them repair boats, mend nets, and add fishing boats and gear in a timely manner, and most of the autumn fishing season loans have been issued to the fishing areas. Fishermen in Tangjia, Nanshui, and other places in the central Guangdong region repaired their old boats and added twenty-six new boats. Fishermen in Zhabo Port, Yangjiang County, have accumulated savings this year due to a good harvest in the off-season, and have purchased fishing production supplies and repaired boats and nets. The past situation of "fish waiting for nets" has been transformed into "nets waiting for fish" this year.

In order to welcome the peak production season and meet the needs of fishermen, the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Company has made careful plans for the purchase, allocation, processing, and transportation and sales of autumn fishing season production, and has prepared to supply more than 30 kinds of fishing production supplies, such as fish blocks, green hemp, wood, thatch, bamboo mats, and fishing lines, worth more than 50 billion yuan, an increase of 80 percent over the same period last year.

In terms of fish processing, the existing salted fish processing equipment of the provincial aquatic product supply and marketing stations can only meet 50 percent of the processing needs for the current production volume. Various aquatic product branch companies are stepping up the basic construction of processing equipment. In addition, the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Company has decided to invest 500 million yuan to build simple processing equipment such as open-air fish ponds (with thatched sheds) and fish buckets, and invest 20 billion yuan to increase transportation tools to ensure the smooth progress of supply, transportation and sales, and processing work.

After entering the autumn fishing season production, Shandong Province's fishermen have seen good production of jellyfish and sharks. Up to now, each shark fishing boat has caught two to three thousand catties. However, due to the general reduction in production in various places in the first half of the year, a provincial aquatic products conference was convened in early September to arrange autumn and winter production, requiring all localities to focus on production to save disaster relief, and mobilize fishermen to use all the tools that can be used for offshore production in autumn. In addition to organizing fishing in coastal areas, efforts will be made to mobilize labor and semi-labor to collect oysters and agar, etc. The lake area mainly helps fishermen actively fish under the principle of protecting aquatic plants, and strives to complete the annual production task of more than 250,000 tons. In addition, it is also required that all localities strengthen transportation and sales, ensure reasonable fish prices, and encourage fishermen's enthusiasm for production. A loan of 20 billion yuan is planned for the autumn fishing season to help fishermen solve the difficulties of going to sea. Fujian fishermen are preparing to go to sea to catch sharks, squid, and large yellow croaker. The Aquatic Products Bureau of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry is organizing cadres to go to the countryside to grasp the key to guiding production. At present, the Dongshan working team and the technical guidance station have begun to work. Jiangsu Province has mobilized fishermen in various places to further carry out ambush and autumn fishing according to the existing production situation and possible conditions in order to increase the output of miscellaneous fish; the government will also strengthen supply and marketing work in order to prepare for next year's spring fishing season in offshore fisheries. Fishermen in the Zhoushan area of ​​coastal Zhejiang are actively repairing fishing boats and fishing gear, preparing to go to sea. According to statistics from Shenjiamen and Putuo County, more than 600 fishing boats are being inspected and repaired. While organizing fishermen to actively welcome the autumn fishing season, Zhejiang Province is also preparing for the winter hairtail spawning season offshore work. Under the leadership of the Party committees and governments, fishermen in various places are actively repairing boats and mending nets, and the government is currently providing loans to increase boats, nets, and funds for going to sea.

    沿海渔民积极投入秋汛生产
    各地人民政府扶助渔民修船补网供应物资
    广东、山东、福建、江苏、浙江沿海各地渔民积极投入秋汛生产。广东省沿海各地渔民正积极修船补网，迎接秋汛旺季更大的丰收。现在，许多艘拖风作业渔船已集中到珠江口外的万山和汕尾、澳头港等渔场捕鱼。粤东、粤西的鱼汛也就要到来，当地围网作业的渔民很快就可完成出海前的准备工作。
    今年广东省沿海建立了渔民政权，进行了民主改革，渔民的生产积极性大大提高。人民政府在淡季中就切实解决渔民的生活困难，帮助渔民及时修船、补网和增设渔船、渔具，秋汛贷款大部已发到渔区。粤中区唐家、南水等地的渔民修补了旧船，还增加了二十六条新船。阳江县闸波港的渔民，今年由于在淡季获得了好收成，有了积蓄，纷纷购置渔业生产用品，修船补网。过去“鱼等网”的情况，今年一变而为“网等鱼”了。
    为了迎接旺季生产，满足渔民需要，广东省水产公司对秋汛生产的收购、调拨、加工、运销工作已作了周密的计划，并已准备好供应渔块、青麻、木材、茨莨、竹笏、?席、钓丝等三十多种渔业生产用品，约值五百多亿元，比去年同期增加了百分之八十。
    鱼货加工方面，现有的全省渔业供销站的咸鱼加工设备，只能供目前生产量百分之五十的加工需要。各水产分公司正加紧进行加工设备的基本建设工程。此外，广东省水产公司又决定投资五亿元，建造露天鱼池（有茅棚上盖）、鱼桶等简单的加工设备，投资二十亿元增加交通运输工具，以保证供应、运销、加工工作的顺利进行。
    山东省渔民进入秋汛生产后，海蜇和鲨鱼生产情况良好，截至现在为止，捕鲨渔船每船已捕二、三千斤。但由于上半年各地普遍减产，因此在九月初召开了全省水产会议，布置了秋、冬生产，要求各地以生产救灾为中心，发动渔民使用秋季能出海生产的工具全部出海生产。沿海除组织捕鱼外，并发动劳力、半劳力采牡犡、石花菜等，湖区主要是帮助渔民在保护水产植物的原则下积极捕鱼，力争全年二十五万余吨的生产任务的完成。此外并要求各地加强运销、保证合理鱼价，鼓励渔民的生产积极性。计划秋汛贷款二百亿元，帮助渔民解决出海困难。福建渔民正准备出海捕鲨鱼、鱿鱼和大黄鱼，省农林厅水产局并组织干部下乡掌握重点指导生产，目前东山工作队和技术指导站已开始进行工作。江苏省已发动各地渔民，根据现有生产情况及可能的条件，进一步进行打伏打秋，以提高杂鱼产量；政府并将加强供销工作，以在近海渔业中为明年的春汛生产作好准备。浙江沿海舟山地区渔民都在积极修理渔船、渔具，准备出海。据沈家门和普陀县统计，就有六百多条渔船正在检查修理。浙江省在组织渔民积极迎接秋汛的同时，并准备冬季带鱼汛的出海工作。各地渔民在党委和政府的领导下，积极修船补网，目前政府正在贷放增船增网和出海的资金。
