Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 19th: On the 19th, two more Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, during the process of being handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, broke from the ranks and requested repatriation. When one of them broke from the ranks, he threw the Kuomintang flag he was holding on the ground; immediately afterwards, a special agent chased after him, raising the flagpole as a weapon to beat this brave person requesting repatriation.

These types of incidents, constantly occurring in the past few days, made the American observer representatives very unhappy. They suddenly lost the relaxed expressions they often displayed, staring at the Volunteer Army prisoner of war with hateful gazes.

All prisoners of war handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission by the U.S. side on the 19th were not checked against the lists. In the previous two days, large numbers of prisoners of war entered the camp without being counted, making it impossible for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces to identify whether those entering the camp were truly prisoners of war. The U.S. side is now using this method to more openly dispatch special agents into the prisoner of war camps guarded by the Indian army, even bringing guard dogs with them. The reporter saw two people in the ranks of prisoners of war on the 19th wearing neat yellow trousers, shiny black leather shoes, and white shirts, wearing dark glasses, and entering the camp along with the prisoners of war. In addition, there were two other people wearing distinct black trousers, each leading a gray military German Shepherd dog into the camp. Obviously, the U.S. side handed these military German Shepherd dogs over to special agents to bring into the camp, the purpose of which is nothing more than to help the special agent organizations within the camp more closely monitor the actions of the prisoners of war, preventing them from escaping from the camp to request repatriation.

In the camps guarded by the Indian forces, Kuomintang special agents are blatantly carrying out activities. They hang up Kuomintang flags, write reactionary slogans on the tents, and people holding wooden sticks patrol near the tents. The reporter saw one person blowing a bugle, and another person using a wooden stick to direct prisoners of war to throw stones at the Korean-Chinese observer representatives. However, some of the stones were clearly deliberately thrown into the open space far away from the Korean-Chinese observer representatives.

### 我志愿军被俘人员又有两名要求遣返

    我志愿军被俘人员又有两名要求遣返
    【新华社开城十九日电】十九日又有两名中国人民志愿军被俘人员在移交给中立国看管过程中，从行列中跑出来要求遣返。其中一个人从行列中跑出来的时候，把他手中的国民党旗子扔在地上；紧跟着就有特务追出来，举起旗杆当作武器来打这个勇敢地要求遣返的人。
    几天以来不断发生的这类事情，使美方观察代表很不愉快，他们突然失去了经常表现出来的轻松神情，用恨恨的目光盯视着那个志愿军被俘人员。
    十九日美方交给中立国看管的战俘全部没有核对名单。前两天也有大批战俘未经点验就进入营场，这就使中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队无法辨别进入营场的人是否真的是战俘。美方现在用这种方法更加公开地派遣特务进入印度军队看管的战俘营场，甚至把警犬也一起带进去。记者十九日在战俘行列中看到有两个人穿着笔挺的黄色裤子、发亮的黑皮鞋和白衬衫，戴着黑眼镜，和战俘一起进入了营场。另外还有两个穿着与众不同的黑裤子的人，各牵一只灰色的军用狼狗进入了营场。显然，美方把这种军用狼狗交给特务带进营场，其目的不外是想帮助营场内的特务组织更加严密地监视战俘的行动，防止他们从营场里逃出来要求遣返。
    在印度部队看管的营场里，国民党特务明目张胆地进行活动。他们挂起国民党的旗帜，在帐篷上涂写反动标语，手持木棒的人在帐篷附近巡逻。记者曾看到一个人吹着军号，另一个人用木棍指挥战俘向朝中观察代表投掷石块。但是有些石块显然是被故意扔在离朝中观察代表很远的空地上了。
