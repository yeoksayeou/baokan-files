Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 5th: According to TASS, Berlin, September 5th: President Wilhelm Pieck of the German Democratic Republic addressed the residents of West Germany on the radio on the evening of the 4th regarding the upcoming West German Federal Assembly elections.

Pieck said: In view of the responsibility of all German people for the cause of striving for the unification and peace of our motherland, I am here to address you. The upcoming Federal Assembly elections are being held at a time of decisive significance for the whole of Germany. Two paths lie before our people. One is the path that leads to a peace conference and the conclusion of a peace treaty through an all-German agreement. This path can lead to the restoration of Germany's unity on a democratic basis, to Germany's national independence, and to becoming a peaceful and great power, establishing friendly and cooperative relations with all nations. The other path is the path through the Bonn and Paris treaties, leading to the unbridled rule of reactionary forces and militarism. This path will lead to the strengthening of foreign imperialist rule and to the outbreak of a third world war on German soil. Adenauer is taking this path of continuing to divide Germany, expanding armaments, and preparing for war.

Pieck pointed out: Adenauer's policy is not a German policy, but an American policy. This is evidenced by the intervention in this election by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, the instigator of the Korean War. Mr. Dulles said that the continued division of Germany is a shame and a crime. However, this crime was committed in December 1949 when the dual-zone agreement was signed in Washington. The division of Germany started with this agreement and was further deepened by the unilateral currency reform and the establishment of a unilateral government in West Germany. Pieck continued: The Bonn "General Treaty" and the Paris military agreements will inevitably and ultimately drag West Germany into the military bloc of the Atlantic nations. The treaties signed by Adenauer negate the possibility of restoring a unified Germany and make the conclusion of a peace treaty impossible. Pieck said: In the elections on September 6, 1953, whoever supports Adenauer and his candidates is voting in favor of war. Whoever wants peace should only vote for those candidates who resolutely oppose the Adenauer government. Pieck said: At present, it is not enough to merely abandon Adenauer's American policy. We must also uphold the cause of Germany's democratic unity and peace. These two great goals can be achieved. The Soviet government's proposal on a peace treaty has opened up a path for us towards a unified and democratic Germany. And such a Germany, free from all reparations, debts, and occupation, will become an independent and sovereign country living in peace with all nations.

Pieck emphasized that the people of eastern and western Germany should reach an agreement on forming an all-German provisional government. This government will safeguard Germany's national interests and rights at the peace conference. The imperialist politicians must not be allowed to arbitrarily make decisions about the German people. The German people must reach an agreement on democratic unity and will receive the support of all peace-loving people. Therefore, in order to reach an agreement among the German people, the agreement of the major powers is also needed.

Pieck concluded: In the Federal Assembly elections, everyone must vote for those candidates who advocate an agreement between Germans, support a joint all-German delegation to attend the peace conference, and advocate the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty. These candidates will be true and advanced fighters for Germany's democratic unity and lasting peace.

    皮克总统向西德居民发表演说
    号召投票选举主张全德达成协议的候选人
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社柏林五日讯：德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克四日晚上在广播电台就即将到来的西德联邦议院选举，向西德居民发表演说。
    皮克说：鉴于全体德国人民对于争取我们祖国统一与和平事业的责任，我来向你们发表演说。即将到来的联邦议院选举是在对整个德国具有决定意义的时候举行的。在我们人民面前摆着两条道路。一条是通过全德的协议导致举行和平会议和缔结和约的道路，这条道路可以导致在民主的基础上恢复德国的统一，可以导致德国的民族独立，而成为一个和平的、伟大的强国，并将与各国人民建立友好合作的关系。另一条道路就是，通过波恩和巴黎条约导致反动势力和军国主义任所欲为的统治。这条道路将导致外国帝国主义统治的加强，导致在德国土地上爆发第三次世界大战。阿登纳走的就是这条继续分裂德国、扩充军备、准备战争的道路。
    皮克指出：阿登纳的政策不是德国的政策，而是美国的政策。朝鲜战争的发动者美国国务卿杜勒斯对这次选举进行干涉证明了这一点。杜勒斯先生说德国的继续分裂是一种耻辱和罪行。但是，这个罪行是在一九四九年十二月在华盛顿签订双占区协定时犯下的。德国的分裂就是从这个协定开始的，而由于片面的货币改革和西德单方面政府的成立更加加深了这一分裂。皮克继续说：波恩的“一般性条约”和巴黎军事协定必然最终地会把西德拉入大西洋各国的军事集团。阿登纳所签订的那些条约否定恢复统一德国的可能性，并使和约的缔结成为不可能。皮克说：在一九五三年九月六日的选举中，谁要是支持阿登纳和他的候选人，他就等于投票赞成战争。谁要主张和平，他就应当只是投那些坚决反对阿登纳政府的候选人的票。皮克说：在目前仅仅摒弃阿登纳的美国政策还不够。我们还必须拥护德国的民主统一与和平的事业，这两个大目标是能够达到的。苏联政府关于和约的建议给我们打开了走向统一和民主的德国的途径。而这样一个解除了一切赔款、各项债务和占领的德国，将成为一个与各国人民和平相处的独立、自主的国家。
    皮克强调德国东部和西部人民就组成一个全德临时政府达成协议。这个政府将在和平会议上保障德国的民族利益和权利。不能让帝国主义的政客们恣意作出有关德国人民的决定，德国人民一定要达成民主统一的协议，并将获得各国爱好和平的人民的支持。因此，为了达成德国人民的协议，同时也需要各大国的协议。
    皮克最后说：大家在联邦议院选举时，必须投票选举那些主张德国人之间达成协议、拥护出席和平会议的全德的共同代表和主张尽速缔结和约的候选人。这些候选人将是争取德国的民主统一和持久和平的真正的先进的战士。
