Overcoming the "Five Excesses" Phenomenon and Grasping the Guiding Principle of Production as the Central Task: Significant Improvements in the Leadership Style of Rural Cadres in the North China Region

Since the North China region launched a campaign this spring to oppose bureaucracy, implement the spirit of the three central documents, and rectify the "five excesses" in rural areas, rural cadres have generally paid attention to connecting with the masses and reality in their work, and the rural leadership style has begun to change. The obvious manifestation of this change is, first, the strengthening of the party's unified leadership, a general reduction in the "five excesses" phenomenon, and the realization of the guiding principle of "production being the overriding central task." During the spring and summer production seasons, local county party committees were generally able to arrange tasks in a unified way around the central task of production based on local conditions, and initially overcame the tendency of vertical systems being emphasized, with each department acting on its own, leading to fragmentation. For example, during the spring plowing and sowing season in Hejian County, Hebei Province, the county party committee made unified arrangements for tasks such as production, implementation of the Marriage Law, literacy campaigns, and land cultivation on behalf of others, ensuring that the work of all systems in the county could be carried out around spring plowing and production, guaranteeing the successful completion of drought resistance and sowing. Basic-level cadres described this method of unified work arrangement as: "Once a large dam is built, the water cannot flow freely!" The Yuci County Party Committee made unified arrangements for tasks and strictly controlled meetings and reports, greatly reducing the number of rural meetings. The meetings that did occur were well-prepared, focused, shorter, and addressed specific problems. This meant more people from the masses attended more quickly than in the past. The masses generally reflected: "The meetings don't last long, but solve many problems." In this way, county and district cadres have been able to devote more time to in-depth production leadership, and village cadres have had more time to work in the fields. In Linfen District II, only six cadres were able to frequently go to the countryside originally, but after changing their leadership methods, this number has increased to twenty-one. Sun Guiqi, the Party branch secretary of Jing Shi Village in Hejian, only harvested seven bundles of grain last autumn, but recently he has accumulated forty-two workdays in the agricultural production cooperative in fifty-two days. Cadres and the masses are generally satisfied. Second, leading cadres went deep into the lower levels to provide specific leadership, making breakthroughs at individual points and driving overall progress, beginning to change their leadership methods that relied solely on meetings and general calls to action. Since this spring, this leadership method has been widely used in drought resistance and planting, technology promotion, and pest and disease prevention. When red spiders were harmful in Linfen District II, Shanxi, the leadership adopted this typical eradication method, organizing visits, and quickly eliminated the pest in more than 50,000 mu of land throughout the district. Third, attention was paid to summarizing the experiences of the local masses and guiding local work according to local characteristics. The masses call this method "using local keys to open local locks" or "using local materials and promoting them locally." For example, when the spring drought was severe, the Hejian County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province conducted in-depth research and summarized the "drilling frame to find springs" method of local labor model Dong Huiqing, and promoted it throughout the county, promoting the drilling of more than 270 wells throughout the county, and the amount of land irrigated by each well has also increased, which was welcomed by the broad masses. This leadership method gradually replaced the coercive methods in rural areas. Cadres who learned this leadership method said: "This way, we have something to do when we go to the countryside and something to say when we come back!" Rural cadres have found new ways to lead production.

The growth of the mass line leadership style has also changed the face of other rural work. This spring, in terms of the supply of means of production and the promotion of agricultural technology, the practice of forced sales and compulsory leadership has been greatly reduced, and cadres have been able to rely on persuasion and education and promote things step by step according to local conditions. For example, when the Yuncheng Prefecture Cooperative in Shanxi Province promoted step plows this year, they taught the technology on the spot and conducted field trials so that farmers could learn how to use them and voluntarily purchase them. As a result of this promotion, the masses changed from suspicion to fondness for new agricultural tools, and more than 5,000 people in Anyi County alone learned how to use and purchase step plows. Due to the attention paid to starting from summarizing the experiences of the masses in the reform of agricultural technology, the results of the promotion also exceeded those of previous years. For example, simple and easy-to-implement technologies that do not cost much money, such as deep plowing to conserve moisture, appropriate close planting, and phased fertilization, have been promoted more widely. This year, the area of wheat densely planted in Ding County, Hebei Province, has nearly doubled compared to last year.

Various localities have also paid great attention to summarizing and promoting these leadership experiences. Ping Shun, Yuci and other counties paid attention to explaining the policies and methods of completing the tasks at the same time when deploying tasks, and also summarized the work style and leadership methods when summarizing the work each time, commended good people and good deeds, and criticized bad people and bad deeds, so that cadres throughout the county gradually established a correct work style.

Now the leadership in various parts of North China is deepening the struggle against bureaucracy, paying attention to commending good people and good deeds, summarizing and exchanging experiences, and continuing to implement the spirit of the three major documents. Provincial and prefectural committees have identified key counties, and counties have identified key villages, societies, and groups to more effectively overcome generalized leadership methods and establish a correct work style.

### 克服“五多”现象掌握以生产为中心任务的方针  华北区农村干部的领导作风大有改进

    克服“五多”现象掌握以生产为中心任务的方针
    华北区农村干部的领导作风大有改进
    华北地区自今年春天开展反对官僚主义、贯彻中央三大文件精神、清理农村“五多”以来，农村干部在工作中普遍注意了联系群众、联系实际，农村领导作风开始有所转变。这种转变的明显表现，首先是党的统一领导开始加强，“五多”现象普遍减少，实现了以“生产为压倒一切的中心”的方针。春夏季生产中各地县委大都能根据当地情况，围绕生产中心统一安排任务，初步克服了强调垂直系统，各自为政的分散主义现象。如河北省河间县在春耕播种时，县委统一安排了生产、贯彻婚姻法、扫除文盲、代耕等任务，使全县各系统工作都能围绕春耕生产进行，保证了抗旱播种的胜利完成。基层干部形容这种统一安排工作的方法说：一道大闸挡住，水就不能乱流了！榆社县县委统一安排了任务，严格控制了会议表报等，使农村会议大为减少，开会时也有准备，有中心，时间缩短，解决问题明确具体，使参加会议的群众比往日来的又快又多。群众普遍反映：开会时间不长，解决问题不少。这样，县区干部也有可能以更多时间深入领导生产，乡村干部也有较多时间下地生产了。临汾二区原来只有六个干部能经常下乡，转变领导方法后已增至二十一个了。河间经诗村党支部书记孙桂启，去年一秋只割了七捆谷，最近五十二天中已在农业生产合作社里记了四十二个工。干部群众普遍表示满意。其次，领导干部深入下层，具体领导，突破一点，推动一般，开始转变了单靠会议和一般号召的领导方法。今春以来，各地在抗旱点种、推广技术、防治病虫害等工作中就普遍运用了这一领导方法。山西临汾二区红蜘蛛为害时，领导方面就采用了这种典型除治，组织参观的办法，把全区五万多亩地中的虫害迅速扑灭。第三，注意总结当地群众经验，根据当地特点，指导当地工作。群众把这办法叫做“用本地钥匙，开本地的锁”或“就地取材，就地推广”。如中共河北省河间县委在春旱严重时，深入发现和总结了当地劳动模范东会清的“钻框找泉”法，在全县推广，推动了全县钻井二百七十多眼，每眼井浇地的数量也增多，受到广大群众欢迎。这种领导方法，在农村中逐渐代替了强迫命令的作法，学会这种领导方法的干部说：这样就下乡有作的，回来有说的了！农村干部找到了领导生产的新门路。
    群众路线的领导作风的生长，使农村其他工作面貌也有所改变。今春在生产资料供应，农作技术推广等方面，强摊硬派，强制带头的作法大为减少，干部多能根据当地情况依靠说服教育，有步骤地推行。如山西运城专区合作社今年推广步犁时就当场传授技术实地试验，使农民学会用法，自愿购买。这样推广的结果，使群众对新式农具由怀疑变为喜爱，只是安邑一县就有五千多人学会使用并购买步犁。在农作技术改革上由于注意从总结群众经验入手，推广成绩也超过往年。如深耕保墒、适当密植、分期施肥等简便易行，花钱不多的技术，推行更为普遍，河北定县今年小麦密植面积超过去年近一倍。
    各地还十分注意总结推广这些领导经验。平顺、榆社等县，每次布置任务时，同时注意交代政策和完成任务的方法，每次总结工作时也同时总结工作作风和领导方法，表扬好人好事，批判坏人坏事，使全县干部逐渐树立正确的工作作风。
    现在华北各地领导方面正在深入反官僚主义斗争，注意表扬好人好事总结交流经验，继续贯彻三大文件的精神。各省委、地委都确定了重点县，各县大都确定了重点村、社、组，以更有效地克服一般化的领导方法，树立正确的工作作风。
