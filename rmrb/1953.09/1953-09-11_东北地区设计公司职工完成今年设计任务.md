Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th. The fourteen design companies under the Northeast Bureau of Building Engineering and various provinces and cities had, by August 15th, completed all of their 1953 design tasks and the additionally assigned housing construction design tasks covering more than 100,000 square meters. Currently, some designers have been dispatched to construction sites with weaker technical capabilities to assist in construction, while others have transitioned to design preparation work for 1954.

This year, in addition to organizing designers to conscientiously study advanced Soviet design experience, each design company used accelerated methods to train new design cadres. This played a significant role in overcoming the difficulty of insufficient design capacity, completing design tasks in a timely manner, and ensuring construction needs. After each company implemented advanced design work experiences such as the Soviet "parallel assembly line operation," "design instruction charts," and "new structural standard design," design efficiency improved significantly. The plumbing and heating design team of Harbin Design Company originally planned to complete five design tasks in twenty days, but after implementing these advanced design methods, they completed six design tasks, exceeding their quota, seven days ahead of schedule. After each company studied the "New Standard Design," the construction department can save an average of 20 to 40 percent or more in materials in the design of reinforced concrete floor slabs alone. In the first quarter of this year, each company also used methods such as running professional crash training courses and apprenticeship programs to enable more than 300 trainees with senior elementary and junior high school education levels to learn how to do simple designs. The 29 trainees trained by the Heilongjiang Provincial Design Company training course are now able to undertake designs for plumbing, heating, and lighting. Yu Shaobin and other trainees from the Harbin Design Company training course learned to draw floor plans, elevations, and calculate a portion of heat loss in just over twenty days. They have now reached the level of junior technicians. Most design companies in Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, and other cities have established and implemented technical, quality, and review responsibility systems, and the completed designs can withstand the test of construction. There have been basically no quality-related incidents of liability.

    东北地区设计公司职工完成今年设计任务
    【新华社沈阳十日电】东北建筑工程局和各省市的十四个设计公司，到八月十五日止已全部完成一九五三年的设计任务和临时追加的十多万平方公尺面积的房屋建筑设计任务。现在，部分设计人员已被派到技术力量较弱的工地帮助施工，部分设计人员转入了一九五四年的设计准备工作。
    各设计公司今年除组织设计人员认真地学习了苏联先进设计经验以外，并用速成的方法培养了新的设计干部。这对于克服设计力量不足的困难，及时完成设计任务以保证施工需要方面，起了很大作用。各公司在推行了苏联的“平行流水作业”、“设计指示图表”和“新结构标准设计”等先进设计工作经验以后，设计效率有了显著提高。哈尔滨市设计公司的水道、暖气设计组原来计划二十天完成五项设计任务，但在推行了以上这些先进设计方法后，就提前七天超额完成了六项设计任务。各公司学习了“新标准设计”以后，只在钢筋混凝土楼板设计方面，就可使建筑部门平均节省材料百分之二十到四十以上。各公司在今年第一季度里，还用办专业的速成训练班和师傅带徒弟等方法，使三百多个具有高小和初中文化水平的学员学会了做简易的设计。黑龙江省设计公司训练班培养出的二十九个学员，现在已能担负水道、暖气和电照等种类的设计。哈尔滨市设计公司训练班学员于少宾等，在二十多天内就学会了画平面图、立面图和计算一部分热量损失等工作。现在他们已经达到了见习技术员的水平。沈阳、旅大、哈尔滨等大部分设计公司，由于建立和贯彻了技术、质量和审核等责任制度，已经完成的设计都能经受得起施工的考验，基本上没有发生质量方面的责任事故。
