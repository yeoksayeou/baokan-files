    The Education We Received in Our First Production Internship
    Dong Zengnan, Political Counselor of the Hydraulic Engineering Department, Tsinghua University
    This summer vacation, more than 40 students from the second year of the hydraulic structure major of our Hydraulic Engineering Department went to the Boshan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Huai River for their first production internship. Everyone participated in the internship with great enthusiasm and the fullest spirit, so they gained a lot in terms of professional skills, ideology, and life experience.

    Before the production internship, some students had great interest in the water conservancy事业 (shìyè - undertaking, cause), but their understanding was not practical enough. Individual students had incorrect views on the major, feeling that water conservancy projects "have neither profound mathematical theory nor art," so their enthusiasm for learning was not high.

    Through activities such as listening to reports, visiting, and participating in seminars during the internship, everyone's understanding of their career became much deeper and richer.

    First of all, everyone realized that water conservancy engineering is an important course, which is related to the lives of millions of people and can create happiness for the people. Pan Zenghong used to want to study mechanical engineering and was not interested in water conservancy事业. After the internship, he changed his view of the water conservancy major and said, "When a dam is built well, the people on both sides of the downstream can live in peace. The best job is the one that has the greatest benefit for the people." He began to feel a great interest and sense of responsibility for his major. Once, Dong Changde asked Song Tingfu, "Do you think our internship life is hard?" But they thought that when Boshan was a poor mountain village before the reservoir was built, there were not many households, and the people lived a poor life. But what about the future? The countryside will prosper, with electric lights and irrigated fields, turning a poor mountain village into a beautiful and rich place. Thinking of this, they were very excited and determined to do this for the rest of their lives.

    We encountered floods during the internship, and the students witnessed the fierce water势 (shì - force, power). Yuan Ziqiang thought of how many families on both sides of the river were worried and unable to relax during the flood season. He was determined to learn water conservancy well, control the river, and forever eliminate the pain that floods bring to the people.

    After listening to the recitation of Polevoi's "Wind-Blown" (describing the life of a water conservancy engineer), everyone was proudly determined to be a "happy sower," bringing happiness and abundance to the people. Li Junlin studied water conservancy so that he could travel around and see the sights; but now he believes: "Studying water conservancy is about overcoming difficulties and opening up a happy avenue through our hands."

    The students also had a practical understanding of the current state of water conservancy事业 in our country. For example, when Zheng Bangmin mentioned water conservancy事业 in the past, he thought of the great scene of the Lenin Canal; now he realizes that our water conservancy事业 today is still very young, there are still many difficulties ahead, and many technical problems need to be solved. In the future, we must work hard to improve ourselves and prepare to serve the water conservancy construction of New China.

    At the same time, before the internship, the students had very little understanding of this major. Pan Zenghong thought that "a reservoir is just a pond piled up with stones," and some students thought that "an earth dam is just a pile of earth, it's very simple, there's nothing to learn." However, after a short two-week internship, the students made amazing progress in their professional skills. Everyone wrote reports, describing the hydraulic枢纽 (shūniǔ - hub, key part), the function, structure, size, and construction of each building that makes up the hydraulic枢纽. Some students said excitedly, "This is the first time I've entered the door of water conservancy."

    Through the internship, everyone felt that they knew too little. To be a water conservancy engineer, you must have more knowledge. After visiting the soil laboratory, one student recognized the relationship between soil mechanics and hydraulic structures; Wang Lizhu realized after seeing the mountain opener that not only should she learn thermodynamics well, but also the theory of diesel engines and air compressors.

    During the internship, everyone saw the role of each course in the project, thus strengthening their sense of responsibility for learning. Pan Zenghong said: "In the past, when doing surveying实习 (shíxí - practical training, internship), because the upper and lower lines were read incorrectly, the error was two meters, and at that time I felt that it didn't matter much; but in actual engineering, it would bring huge losses to the people." Many students criticized the previous mistake of not paying attention to surveying and recognized that every course is important.

    Through this internship, students generally realized that a people's engineer must have the spirit of hard work, not being afraid of difficulties, and being highly responsible to the people and the country. Jiang Kai said: "The water conservancy事业 itself is a test of people." Jin Bingwu said: "I used to be most afraid of difficulties, but the water conservancy事业 is full of difficulties, and I must cultivate my spirit of fighting against difficulties."

    During the internship, everyone saw that a great project is the crystallization of the hard work of thousands of people, and they felt the greatness of the power of the masses.

    The students also deeply realized that a great事业 is accumulated from small and ordinary work. For example, an earth dam stands upright like a mountain, and it is built by the hard work of people. They all thought that they should treat every ordinary job with a creative attitude in the future.

    In this internship, the students gained a deeper understanding of the actual situation of national construction and the lives of rural people, and thus realized the serious significance of economic construction. In the past, many students only thought of the beautiful prospects of the motherland and could not see the arduous side of construction. As Tian Naishu said: "I am like a flower grown in a greenhouse. I don't understand the lives of the people. In the future, I must train myself from work and from real life."

    Practice has made our yearning for the beautiful future of the motherland even stronger. When the train sped across the vast North China Plain, when we saw the great Yellow River, everyone thought: Collective farms and hydroelectric power stations will appear here.

    我们在第一次生产实习中受到的教育
    清华大学水利工程系政治辅导员　董曾南
    今年暑假，我们水利系水工结构专业二年级四十多个同学到淮河上游的薄山水库进行了第一次生产实习。每个人都以极高的热情和最饱满的情绪进行实习，因此在业务上、思想上、生活锻炼上都有很多收获。
    在生产实习前，有的同学对自己所将从事的水利事业虽然有很大的兴趣，但认识不够切实。个别同学对专业有不正确的看法，觉得水利工程“既无高深的数学理论，也不艺术”，因此学习情绪不高。
    在实习中通过听报告、参观、座谈等活动，大家对自己事业的认识深刻多了，丰富多了。
    首先大家认识到水利工程是一门重要的课程，它关系着千百万人民的生活，它可以为人民创造幸福。潘曾鸿同学以前想学机械，对水利事业不感兴趣。实习以后，他改变了对水利专业的看法，说：“一个坝做好了，下游两岸的人民就可以安心生活。最好的工作就是对人民有最大利益的工作。”他对自己的专业开始感到很大的兴趣和责任感。有一次董长德同学问宋廷福同学：“你说咱们实习的生活苦不苦？”但是他们想到薄山这里在没修水库的时候，就是一个穷山沟，没有几户人家，人民过着贫苦的生活。但是将来呢，农村将要繁盛起来，点上电灯，田地得到灌溉，把一个穷山沟变成了美丽富饶的地方。他们想到这里，心中很兴奋，决心这样干一辈子。
    我们在实习中碰到了洪水，同学们亲眼看见了凶猛的水势。袁自强同学想到河流两岸多少人家一到汛期就提心吊胆，不能松下心来过日子，立志要学好水利，控制河流，永远解除洪水带给人民的痛苦。
    在听了波列伏依“随风飘”（描写一个水利工程师的生活）一文的朗诵以后，每一个人都自豪地要做一个“幸福的播种者”，把幸福和富饶带给人民。李君林同学学水利为的是可以到各处跑，游山逛水；但是现在他认为：“学水利就是要克服困难，通过我们的双手开辟一条幸福的大道。”
    同学们对目前我国的水利事业也都有了实际的认识。例如郑邦民同学以前一提到水利事业就想到列宁运河的伟大场面；现在认识了我们今天的水利事业还很年轻，面前还有很多困难，需要解决很多技术上的难题，今后要努力提高自己准备为新中国水利建设服务。
    同时在实习前同学对这一专业的了解也是很少的，潘曾鸿同学以为“水库就是用石头堆个塘”，有的同学以为“土坝就是一堆土，很简单，没啥可学”。但是经过短短两个星期的实习，同学们在业务上有了惊人的进步。每个人都写了报告，叙述了水力枢纽，组成水力枢纽的各个建筑物的作用、构造、尺寸和施工情形。有的同学兴奋地说：“这次才算入了水利学的门。”
    通过实习，大家都感到自己知道的东西太少了。要做一个水利工程师，必须具备更多的知识。一个同学在参观完了土壤实验室后，认识了土壤力学与水工结构的关系；王丽珠同学看了开山机后认识到不仅需要学好热工学，还要学好关于柴油机、空气压缩机的理论。
    在实习中，大家看到了每门课程在工程中的作用，因此加强了自己的学习责任感。潘曾鸿同学说：“过去做测量实习由于上下线读错了，误差两公尺，当时觉得没多大关系；但在实际工程中它会给人民带来巨大的损失。”很多同学批判了以前不重视测量的错误，认识到每一门课程都是重要的。
    通过这次实习，同学们普遍认识到一个人民工程师必须具有坚苦耐劳、不怕困难和对人民、国家高度负责的精神。姜铠同学说：“水利事业本身就是对人的一个考验。”金炳五同学说：“以前我最怕困难，但是水利事业则充满了困难，我必须培养自己向困难作斗争的精神。”
    在实习中大家看到一个伟大的工程是成千上万人们的辛勤劳动的结晶，体会到群众力量的伟大。
    同学们还深刻地体会到伟大的事业是由细小而平凡的工作积累成的。比如一个土坝，像一座山一样矗然直立，它是由人们的辛勤劳动建立起来的。他们都想着自己将来应该用创造性的态度对待每一件平凡的工作。
    在这次实习中，同学们对国家建设的实际情况，对农村人民的生活有了进一步的了解，因而更加认识到经济建设的严重意义。以前，许多同学只想到祖国的美丽远景，看不见建设中艰巨的一面。正如田乃姝同学说的：“自己就好像在暖房中生长的花草，不了解人民的生活，以后必需从工作、从现实生活中锻炼自己。”
    实践使我们对祖国美丽前途的向往更加强烈了，当火车疾驰在广大的华北平原，当我们看到伟大的黄河，每个人都想着：这里将出现集体农庄和水电站。
