    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Should Strive to Open Up and Organize Local Sources of Goods
    ——Summary of Readers' Letters
    Recently, readers have reflected a noteworthy problem in the operation of rural grassroots cooperatives. This is that while many rural grassroots cooperatives have accumulated a large number of commodities, on the other hand, the materials urgently needed by farmers cannot be supplied as they should be. For example, the grassroots cooperatives in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, have accumulated a large number of checkered silk, wool, high-quality thermos bottles, lighters, and other items that farmers do not need, worth about 900 million yuan. According to statistics from eleven grassroots cooperatives in Zhengding County, Hebei Province, the accumulation of various colored cloths, fancy serge, etc., alone reached 974 pieces. However, many rural grassroots cooperatives have very little or frequent stockouts of materials urgently needed by farmers. For example, the Jianziying Cooperative in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, operates more than 1,000 kinds of commodities, but the daily necessities urgently needed by members, such as edible salt, are often out of stock. The Lianhua Village Cooperative in Qu County, Zhejiang Province, took in more than 200 million yuan worth of goods in one month, but the edible oil needed by farmers could not be adequately supplied.
    The reasons for the above situation are mainly that the cadres of the grassroots cooperatives have not conducted in-depth investigations into the needs of the rural members, and at the same time, some business cadres of the higher-level cooperatives have the idea of simply relying on large cities for the supply of goods when organizing sources of goods. They subjectively believe that farmers welcome brand-name goods and ignore the promotion of local industries, especially handicrafts and rural sideline products. According to the investigation reports of the working groups recently dispatched to various places by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, many of the commodities accumulated in rural grassroots cooperatives are brand-name goods from large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin, such as "414" towels, worsted wool, khaki cloth, etc. This shows that farmers do not need these high-end consumer goods at present. In the second quarter of this year, the Nanhui County Cooperative in Jiangsu Province conducted a survey in rural areas and market towns on the sources of production materials and daily necessities used by farmers, and found that more than 70 percent of the goods needed by farmers were products of local industries and handicrafts. However, when some higher-level cooperatives find that high-end consumer goods are not easy to sell in rural areas, instead of actively trying to allocate them elsewhere, they rigidly "apportion" them downwards. For example, the Yuncheng Office of the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union blindly purchased a large batch of Qiqiao fancy serge that could not be sold, and later rigidly allocated them to the county cooperatives (200 pieces per county); the county cooperatives then allocated these fancy serge to the grassroots cooperatives, causing accumulation in the grassroots cooperatives. For example, the Tianjin Prefecture Cooperative of Hebei Province once allocated 18,000 boxes of toothpaste to a county cooperative, which, according to the current sales volume of the county, would take three years to sell. The things farmers need are often out of stock or not even carried by the cooperatives, while unneeded commodities occupy a large amount of the cooperatives' funds; this practice violates the basic principle of supply and marketing cooperatives serving the members and serving production, and has aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of members.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives must change their past idea of unilaterally relying on goods from large cities according to the needs of the members and masses, and actively open up and organize the work of local sources of goods. The Xuancheng County Cooperative in Anhui Province has paid attention to this work, and has planned to operate local goods, especially small farm tools, daily furniture, as well as edible oil, native cloth and other production and daily necessities, which has been welcomed by the broad masses of members. This is a successful example. At present, the autumn harvest has begun in the countryside, and the peak season for trade is coming. Vigorously supplying materials, especially opening up and organizing the supply of local goods, should be the urgent task of supply and marketing cooperatives. Since cooperatives are not yet familiar with the production and sales of local industries and handicrafts, they should immediately adopt the method of small-scale materials exchange fairs, widely collect samples, organize members to visit, and mobilize producers and grassroots cooperatives to participate in the materials exchange fairs, so as to communicate production and sales information and lay the foundation for the future supply of local goods.

    供销合作社应该努力开辟和组织地方货源
    ——读者来信综述
    最近，读者反映了农村基层合作社经营中的一个值得注意的问题。这就是不少农村基层合作社一方面积压了大量商品，而另一方面，农民迫切需要的物资却得不到应有的供应。例如，松江省桦川县各基层合作社积压了许多农民所不需要的格子绸、呢绒、上等暖水瓶、打火机等，价值约九亿多元。据河北省正定县十一个基层合作社的统计，仅各种色布、花哔叽等积压即达九百七十四匹。但是，农民迫切需要的物资，不少农村基层合作社却很少经营或经常脱销。如松江省桦川县建子营合作社经营商品多达一千多种，可是社员急需的生活资料，如食盐等，常有脱销现象。浙江省衢县莲花村合作社一个月内进了二亿多元的货物，但农民所需要的食油却不能充分供应。
    造成上述情况的原因，主要是基层合作社干部对农村社员的需要没有进行深入的调查，同时某些上级合作社的业务干部，在组织货源时又有单纯依靠大城市供应货物的思想。他们主观地认为农民欢迎名牌货，而忽视了地方工业，尤其是手工业和农村副业产品的推销工作。据全国合作总社最近派往各地的工作组调查报告，很多农村基层社积压的商品，多系上海、天津等大城市的名牌货，如“四一四”毛巾、华达呢、咔叽布等。这就说明，目前农民是不需要这些高级消费品的。江苏省南汇县合作社今年第二季度在农村和集镇对农民所使用生产资料和生活资料的来源进行了一次调查，发现农民所需要的货物百分之七十以上是地方工业和手工业的产品。但有些上级合作社当发现高级消费品在农村不易销售时，不积极设法调拨出去，却硬性地往下“摊派”。如山西省合作联合社运城办事处就曾盲目地采购了无法推销的大批七巧花哔叽，后来硬性配给各县合作社（每县二百匹）；县合作社又把这些花哔叽拨给各基层合作社，造成了各基层合作社的积压。如河北省天津专区合作社一次拨给一个县合作社牙膏一万八千盒，按目前该县的销售量，这批牙膏要销三年之久。农民需要的东西，合作社经常脱销甚至不经营，不需要的商品却占用了合作社的大量资金；这种做法违反了供销合作社为社员服务、为生产服务的基本方针，已经引起广大社员群众的不满。
    供销合作社必须按照社员群众的需要，改变过去那种片面依靠大城市来货的思想，积极开辟与组织地方货源的工作。安徽省宣城县合作社注意了这项工作，有计划地经营地方货，特别是小农具、日用家具以及食油、土布等生产和生活必需品，受到了广大社员的欢迎。这就是一个成功的例子。目前农村已在秋收，贸易上的旺季已经来临，大力供应物资，特别是开辟与组织地方货物的供应，应该是供销合作社刻不容缓的任务。由于合作社对地方工业与手工业生产的产销情况还不熟悉，所以在目前应即采取小型物资交流会的方式，广泛收集样品，组织社员群众参观；发动生产者、基层合作社参加物资交流会，借以沟通产销情况，打下今后供应地方货物的基础。
