Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 18th: Today, another six Korean People's Army prisoners of war who broke through the control of special agents and requested repatriation were handed over to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

At around 3:30 this afternoon, these six of our captured personnel arrived at Panmunjom in a medium-sized jeep. As they jumped out of the car, they rolled up their sleeves, exposing the blue characters forcibly tattooed on their arms, for the personnel of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the staff of the Korean-Chinese side surrounding the vehicle to see. One of our captured personnel, Wu Haoyuan, cried out with emotion, "The US special agents tattooed us to prevent us from returning. But we have finally returned!" At this time, several American soldiers in dark green uniforms standing nearby pretended to be nonchalant.

In the rest tent, these six returnees were warmly welcomed by General Kim Il of the Korean People's Army, Colonel Li Pingyi and Colonel Wang Jian of the Korean-Chinese side of the POW Repatriation Committee, and answered many questions from reporters. The dark and thin returnee said, "My name is Wu Haoyuan. I risked climbing the barbed wire fence to expose the crimes of those wolf-like special agents and to rescue our brothers inside!"

In a temporary reception station in Kaesong, reporters had a long conversation with Wu Haoyuan. He personally witnessed the various activities of the special agents inside the POW camp under the supervision of the Neutral Nations from the morning of the 15th to the 17th. He said that a tent near the gate was called the "Headquarters," and inside were key special agents such as the so-called "Operations Staff," who directed the special agents throughout the POW camp. In the "Headquarters" there were also more than 30 "Guard Teams" patrolling the POW camp day and night. In addition, there was a so-called "Special Agent Team," mixed in each tent to control the prisoners, on duty in shifts every two hours, day and night. He said, "On the afternoon of the 15th, when the Korean-Chinese observer representatives were observing the handover work, a short 'Operations Staff' ordered us to throw stones. Because I was unwilling to follow the special agents in doing these things, I pretended to be sick and hid in the tent. At 3:00 AM on the 16th, I was dragged out by the guard team and beaten with tent poles. Later, I didn't dare to eat for a day, fearing that they would find out I was pretending to be sick and would be beaten again."

Wu Haoyuan became excited when he talked about his experience of breaking through such tight special agent control. He said that after being hungry for a day on the 16th, he got up early the next morning and pretended to do "gymnastics," walked around the camp, and went near the toilet. There were originally two special agent "sentries" there, but they were gone at the time, he didn't know where. He hurriedly used the toilet as cover to climb over the first barbed wire fence. When climbing the second barbed wire fence, he fell because the wire was loose. He said, "Just then, I was discovered by the special agents. They shouted and threw fist-sized stones at me. I ignored everything and climbed over the barbed wire fence." Later, he was taken out by Indian soldiers and placed in another tent under guard.

Wu Haoyuan also confirmed the facts of the evil activities of the US and Syngman Rhee special agents in premeditatedly sabotaging our explanation work, as stated by previous returnees. In the Nonsan First POW Camp where Wu Haoyuan was originally detained, like other POW camps for non-direct repatriation, more than 20 Syngman Rhee army officers came in late August and told the prisoners that in the future they should use insults, spitting, throwing stones, beatings, and other methods to refuse explanations. They also threatened the prisoners that if anyone asked to be repatriated, they would be beaten to death and buried. Wu Haoyuan said that when the prisoners got off the train near the new camp, the special agents ordered everyone to pick up some stones and put them in their pockets. Anyone who did not obey the order to throw stones at the roll call location would be beaten to death.

    朝鲜人民军被俘人员六名回到祖国怀抱
    吴浩渊等揭露美方和李匪特务预谋破坏我方解释工作
    【新华社开城十八日电】今日又有六名突破特务控制要求遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员由中立国遣返委员会遣交我方。
    下午三时半左右，这六个我方被俘人员乘一辆中型吉普车到达板门店。他们跳下车，就卷起衣袖，露出胳膊上被强迫刺上的蓝字，给围着车子的中立国遣返委员会人员、朝中方面工作人员看。一位我方被俘人员吴浩渊含着眼泪激动地高呼说：“美方特务在我们身上刺字，阻止我们回来。但是我们终于回来了！”这时，站在一旁几个穿着暗绿色军衣的美军人员却装得若无其事的样子。
    在休息帐篷中，这六位归来人员受到朝鲜人民军金日将军、战俘遣返委员会朝中方面委员李平一上校、王健上校的热烈欢迎，并回答了记者们的许多问题。那位黑黑瘦瘦的归来人员说：“我的名字叫吴浩渊，我冒险爬铁丝网出来是为了控诉那些恶狼般的特务们的罪恶，搭救我们里面的兄弟！”
    在开城一个临时接待站，记者与吴浩渊作了较长时间的谈话。他在十五日上午到十七日在中立国看管的战俘营里的两天中，亲眼见到特务分子在里面的种种活动。他说，在靠大门那里的一个帐篷被叫做“参谋部”，里面有所谓“作战参谋”等主要特务，指挥整个战俘营的特务分子。在“参谋部”里还有三十多个“警备队”，日夜在战俘营内巡逻。另外还有所谓“特务队”，混在各帐篷中控制战俘，每隔两小时一班，日夜轮流站岗。他说：“十五日下午，当朝中观察代表观察交接工作时，就有一个矮个子的‘作战参谋’命令我们扔石块。我因为不愿跟着特务做这些事便装病躲在帐篷里，在十六日拂晓三点多钟被警备队拖去用帐篷杆子打了一顿，后来我一天都不敢吃饭，怕他们发现我是装病，又要挨打。”
    吴浩渊谈到他突破这样严密的特务控制的经过时就兴奋起来了。他说，他在十六日饿了一天以后，第二天一早就爬起来装作做“体操”，在营场里转了一圈，就到厕所附近去。那里原有两个特务“岗哨”，当时不知干什么去了。他便急忙利用厕所做掩护，攀越出了第一道铁丝网，到攀第二道铁丝网时，因铁丝松脱跌了一跤。他说：“正在这时，我被特务们发现了。他们喊叫着把拳头大的石块乱掷过来，我不顾一切地从铁丝网上翻了过去。”以后，他就由印度士兵领出去放在另一个帐篷里看管起来。
    吴浩渊也证实了以前归来人员所述美方和李匪特务进行预谋破坏我方解释工作的罪恶活动的事实。在原来拘禁吴浩渊的论山第一战俘营里，也像其他不直接遣返的战俘营一样，在八月下旬来了二十多个李伪军军官，叫战俘们将来要用辱骂、吐唾沫、扔石块、殴打等办法来拒绝解释。他们并且恐吓战俘说，若有人要求遣返，就把他打死埋掉。吴浩渊说，当战俘们在新营地附近火车站下车时，特务们就命令每个人都要捡些石块放在口袋里，到点验地点谁不听命令投石块，他就要被打死。
