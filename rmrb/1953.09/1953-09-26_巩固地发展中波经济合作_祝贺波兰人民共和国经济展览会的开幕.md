    Consolidating and Developing Sino-Polish Economic Cooperation
    —Congratulations on the Opening of the Economic Exhibition of the People's Republic of Poland
    Xu Xuehan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, Central People's Government
    The Economic Exhibition of the People's Republic of Poland opens in Beijing today. This is a large-scale exhibition held by the People's Republic of Poland in our country. It fully reflects the great creative power of the Polish people, vividly illustrates the brilliant achievements Poland has made in its economy since liberation, and marks the unbreakable friendly and united relationship between the Chinese and Polish people. This will undoubtedly play a huge role and make a great contribution to strengthening Sino-Polish economic cooperation and promoting trade relations and cultural and scientific exchanges between the two sides.
    The reason why the Polish people have been able to achieve such great achievements today is obviously inseparable from the Polish people’s persistent and long-term struggle history and the great political victory achieved after Poland’s liberation. During World War II, due to the corruption and incompetence of the Polish landlord-bourgeoisie reactionary rule, Poland fell under the bloody rule, barbaric and brutal burning, killing and destruction of the Fascist bandits, but the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish Workers' Party (i.e. the Communist Party), always persisted in the heroic resistance movement. In 1944, the armed divisions founded by the Polish people, fought side by side with the powerful and invincible heroic Soviet army, and finally completely defeated the Fascist bandits and successfully established a people's democratic regime, enabling the Polish people to truly achieve freedom, liberation and independence, opening up a new era in the history of the Polish people. In 1952, the Polish Parliament passed the Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland, which used legislative procedures to summarize and affirm the victorious achievements and new class forces comparison that the Polish people had achieved in political and social reforms since liberation. These huge political victories have become a fundamental guarantee for the restoration and development of the Polish economy. Under the wise leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and its great leader Chairman Beirut, and with the selfless and vigorous assistance of the Soviet Union, the Polish people are fighting to build a new Poland with high labor enthusiasm and selfless spirit. In just a few years after the war, the serious damage and trauma suffered in the war were quickly cured; especially after the successful completion of the Three-Year Plan (1947-1949) in two years and ten months ahead of schedule, the Polish people's economy was basically restored and laid a solid foundation for development. In July 1950, the Polish Parliament passed the Six-Year Plan for laying the socialist foundation in the country, determining the direction of Polish industry, society, and politics from 1950 to 1955. As Chairman Beirut pointed out, this Six-Year Plan "is not only an economic program, but also an ideological and political program for transforming the social system in the future," "is a plan to establish a solid new social system foundation - a socialist foundation - for Poland." Its basic task is to extensively and actively improve productivity on the basis of developing modern technology, first of all the production of means of production, so that Poland can be transformed from an agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. The Polish people, full of victorious confidence, are enthusiastically and actively implementing the Six-Year Plan to express their support for the Polish United Workers' Party and their love for the motherland. Now Poland's industrial output has reached more than three times that of the bourgeois Polish era, especially heavy industry, which has developed even faster. Grain output has also increased more than three times compared with 1946, and it is still increasing. In the process of implementing the Six-Year Plan, within the three years from 1950 to 1952, industrial production was successfully completed and overfulfilled the plan, and the value of industrial production almost exceeded the plan by 13.5 percent. Moreover, because the plans for metallurgy, machinery, coal mining, shipbuilding, and electric power and other heavy industries have been overfulfilled, the output of milled iron, rolled metal, coal, tractors, automobiles, and other heavy industrial products has also greatly exceeded the plan. Many medium-sized and giant new factories and new enterprises have been built in various places, some of which, such as the tractor and automobile industry, the shipbuilding industry, and the heavy machinery industry, had never existed in Poland before the war. The giant heavy industry being built with the vigorous assistance of the Soviet Union—the "Nowa Huta" black metallurgical joint factory, which can refine 1.5 million tons of steel a year—has become a clear direction and symbol of Poland's industrial construction. The various high-quality new machine tools, construction machines, mining machines, agricultural machines, automobiles and other excellent industrial products exhibited in this exhibition are vivid examples of the great achievements made by the people's Poland in industrial construction. We are not only extremely excited about the brilliant victories achieved by the fraternal Polish people on the economic front, but also feel infinite glory and pride. Because we deeply understand that today's victory of every socialist country and people's democratic country is also the victory of the entire world peace and democracy camp; the achievements made by each of our fraternal countries will greatly strengthen the strength of the peace fortress headed by the great Soviet Union. The great achievements of the new Poland, an important link in the world peace camp, in politics and economy will undoubtedly play a huge role in consolidating and developing the entire peace and democracy cause.
    The Chinese people, who are actively carrying out the Five-Year Plan construction, are paying attention to every huge progress made by the people's Poland in the process of victoriously moving towards socialism with incomparable excitement and joy.
    The economic cooperative relationship between China and Poland has been firmly established on the basis of the internationalist spirit of equality and mutual benefit. In Poland’s Three-Year Plan, “expanding the proportion of Poland’s foreign trade in the world economy” was listed as one of the central tasks; in the Six-Year Plan, it was further clarified that the most important task of Poland’s foreign trade is to constantly consolidate and strengthen the economic ties between Poland and the Soviet Union and the people’s democratic countries, and to expand economic cooperation and goods exchange with various brotherly countries as much as possible. According to the plan, Poland’s foreign trade volume in 1955 will increase by about 40% compared with 1949; the proportion of Poland’s trade with the Soviet Union and various people’s democratic countries in the total trade volume will also increase from 44% in 1949 to 68%. Trade between Poland and the Soviet Union will increase by 138% between 1950 and 1955, and trade between Poland and other brotherly countries will also continue to expand in a planned manner year by year. The leap-forward development of Poland's industrial construction has created favorable preconditions for developing foreign trade. On February 28, 1950, China and Poland concluded the Sino-Polish Barter Contract and the Sino-Polish Barter Agreement in Beijing. This was the first trade agreement we signed with Eastern European people's democratic countries since the founding of our country. Through this kind of trade connection, our country has obtained from Poland the hardware, steel, machine tools, chemical raw materials and people's daily necessities necessary for industrial construction. We are also provided with complete sets of equipment for two sugar refineries by Poland; Poland has also obtained from our country various minerals, animal products and industrial raw materials such as cotton, as well as civilian necessities such as oils, oilseeds, tobacco, tea, and food, which are needed in socialist construction. With the increasing prosperity and development of the economies of China and Poland, the variety and turnover of goods exchanged between China and Poland continue to expand. In 1953, the trade volume between China and Poland has increased more than three times compared with 1950. The vigorous development of Sino-Polish trade not only guarantees the growing needs of the people of China and Poland in production and life, but also promotes the realization of economic plans and economic prosperity and boom on both sides, and consolidates the role of the democratic world market in the entire world economy. In the future, in the course of China's Five-Year Plan and Poland's Six-Year Plan, Sino-Polish trade will definitely continue to grow in a more planned and steady manner, deeply embodying its role in communicating the links in the economic plans of both sides and ensuring the smooth completion of economic construction tasks.
    The friendly cooperation and mutual assistance between the Chinese and Polish people are not only reflected in trade relations, but also in other aspects. For example, the Sino-Polish Shipping Company established by Poland has developed Sino-Polish maritime transportation relations, allowing both sides to regularly ship export goods between the Yellow Sea and the Baltic Sea, and guaranteeing the implementation of trade agreements between our country and various Eastern European brotherly countries, shattering the US imperialist conspiracy to "blockade" and "embargo" our country. In terms of cultural exchanges, the Sino-Polish Cultural Cooperation Agreement was concluded, and the Sino-Polish Cultural Cooperation Joint Committee was formed. Last year, the Chinese cultural and educational delegation to the Eastern European people's democratic countries paid a friendly visit to Poland; this year, our country also sent a cultural delegation to Poland to participate in the formulation of the 1953 implementation plan for the Sino-Polish Cultural Cooperation Agreement, further strengthening the cooperation between China and Poland in culture, science, and art. In April this year, the Polish "Mazowsze" song and dance troupe came to China to perform and was warmly welcomed and praised by the broad masses of our people, further consolidating the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Polish people. Recently, in order to respond to the call of the World Peace Council, lectures and introductions commemorating the great Polish scientist Copernicus and the great Chinese patriotic poet Qu Yuan will also enhance mutual understanding between the Chinese and Polish people. The exhibition of the Economic Exhibition of the People's Republic of Poland has enabled us to have a more comprehensive and profound understanding of the great economic achievements and the development of industrial production in the people's Poland since liberation. We can learn from it the advanced experience of the Polish people in implementing planned economic construction, helping us to better complete our Five-Year Plan economic construction.
    On our path to socialism, steadily moving towards prosperity and strength, we will unswervingly implement Chairman Mao's instructions: "On this long-term goal, abroad, we must firmly unite with the Soviet Union, all new democratic countries, and all peace and democratic forces in the world, and there must be no wavering or shaking on this." We will continue to strengthen the economic cooperation and friendly mutual assistance between the Chinese and Polish people, and jointly fight to defend world peace and build a better future, and move forward hand in hand towards new and greater victories!

    巩固地发展中波经济合作
    ——祝贺波兰人民共和国经济展览会的开幕
    中央人民政府对外贸易部副部长　徐雪寒
    波兰人民共和国经济展览会今天在北京开幕了。这是波兰人民共和国到我国举办的一个规模宏大的展览会；它充分反映出波兰人民伟大的创造力量，生动地说明了波兰解放以来在经济上所获得的辉煌成就，并标志着中波两国人民之间牢不可破的友好团结关系。这对于加强中波经济合作，促进双方贸易联系和文化、科学的交流，无疑地将有巨大的作用和贡献。
    波兰人民所以能获得今天这样伟大的成就，跟波兰人民坚持不懈的长期斗争历史以及波兰解放后在政治上所取得的伟大的胜利，显然是分不开的。在第二次世界大战时期，由于波兰地主——资产阶级反动统治的腐败无能，使波兰沦陷于法西斯匪帮的血腥统治和野蛮、残暴的烧杀破坏之下，但波兰人民在波兰工人党（即共产党）的领导下，始终坚持地进行着英勇抵抗运动。一九四四年，波兰人民所创立的武装师团，配合着强大无敌的英雄的苏联军队并肩作战，终于彻底击溃了法西斯匪帮，胜利地建立起人民民主政权，使波兰人民真正取得了自由、解放和独立，在波兰人民的历史上开辟了一个新纪元。一九五二年波兰议会通过了波兰人民共和国宪法，将波兰人民解放以后在政治上与社会改革上所取得的胜利成果以及新的阶级力量的对比关系，用立法手续予以总结和肯定。这些政治上的巨大胜利，也就成为恢复与发展波兰经济的一个根本保证。在波兰统一工人党及其伟大领袖贝鲁特主席的英明领导和苏联的无私的大力援助之下，波兰人民以高度的劳动热情和忘我精神，为了建设新波兰而斗争。在战后短短几年中，迅速地治愈了在战争中所遭到的严重破坏和创伤；特别是三年计划（一九四七——一九四九年）提前在两年十个月内胜利完成后，使波兰人民经济基本上恢复并奠定了巩固的发展基础。一九五○年七月，波兰议会通过了为在国内奠定社会主义基础的六年计划，确定了一九五○年到一九五五年波兰工业、社会与政治的方向。正如贝鲁特主席所指出，这个六年计划，“不仅是一个经济纲领，并且还是今后改造社会制度的思想纲领、政治纲领”，“是为了建立波兰牢固的新的社会制度基础——社会主义基础——的一个计划”。其基本任务，就是要在发展现代技术基础上，广泛地积极地提高生产力，首先是生产资料的生产，使波兰从农业国变为先进的工业国。充满着胜利信心的波兰人民正在热情地积极地执行着六年计划，来表示他们对波兰统一工人党的拥护和对祖国的热爱。现在波兰工业生产量已达到资产阶级波兰时代的三倍以上，尤其是重工业生产，发展得更快。谷物产量亦较一九四六年增加了三倍多，并且还在继续增加中。在六年计划的执行过程中，从一九五○年到一九五二年这三年之内，工业生产胜利地完成并超额完成了计划，工业生产的价值差不多超过计划百分之十三点五，今年上半年工业生产也超过了计划百分之三。而且由于冶金、机器、采煤、造船和电力等重工业的计划都超额完成，以致铣铁、压延金属、煤、拖拉机、汽车和其他各种重工业产品的产量，也都大大超过了计划。许多中等和巨型的新工厂、新企业在各地纷纷兴建，其中有些工业，如拖拉机和汽车工业、造船工业、重型机器工业等，在波兰战前都是从未有过的。在苏联大力援助下进行建设着的巨型重工业—一年可炼出一百五十万吨钢的“诺瓦·胡塔”黑色冶金联合工厂，更成为波兰工业建设中一个鲜明的方向和标志。这次展览会中所展出的各种品质精良的新式的工作母机、建筑机器、采矿机器、农业机器、汽车以及其他优良的工业产品，就是人民波兰在工业建设中所取得的伟大成就的生动例证。我们对于兄弟般的波兰人民在经济战线上所取得的辉煌的胜利，不仅感到无比的兴奋，而且感到无限的光荣和自豪。因为我们深深了解：今天每个社会主义国家与人民民主国家的胜利，也就是整个世界和平民主阵营的胜利；我们每个兄弟国家所取得的成就，都将大大加强以伟大苏联为首的和平堡垒的力量。作为世界和平阵营中重要一环的新波兰在政治、经济各方面所获得的伟大成就，对整个和平民主事业的巩固与发展，毫无疑义会起着巨大的推动作用。
    正在积极进行着五年计划建设的中国人民，怀着无比兴奋和愉快的心情，注意着人民波兰在胜利走向社会主义过程中每一个巨大的进展。
    中波两国的经济合作关系，在平等、互利的国际主义精神的基础上，巩固地建立了起来。在波兰的三年计划中，曾将“扩大波兰对外贸易在世界经济中所占的比重”列为中心任务之一；在六年计划中，更进一步明确规定，波兰对外贸易的最重要任务，就是要不断地巩固和加强波兰经济与苏联及人民民主国家经济之间的联系，尽量地扩大对各兄弟国家之间的经济合作和货物交换。按照计划，一九五五年波兰对外贸易额将比一九四九年增长百分之四十左右；波兰对苏联及各人民民主国家贸易额在总贸易额中所占比重也将由一九四九年的百分之四十四提高到百分之六十八。波兰与苏联之间的贸易，在一九五○年至一九五五年之间，将增加百分之一百三十八，波兰与其他各兄弟国家间的贸易也将不断有计划地逐年扩大。波兰在工业建设上的飞跃发展，为开展对外贸易创造了有利的前提条件。一九五○年二月二十八日，中波两国在北京缔结了中波易货合同与中波易货协议书，这是我们建国以来第一次与东欧人民民主国家签订的贸易协定。通过这种贸易上的联系，使我国从波兰取得了工业建设所必需的五金钢材、工作母机、化工原料及人民日用必需品。并且还由波兰供给我们两个制糖工厂的成套设备；波兰也从我国获得了在社会主义建设中所需要的各种矿产、畜产及棉花等工业原料以及油脂、油料、烟、茶、食品等民用必需品。随着中波两国经济的日益繁荣和发展，中波双方货物交换的品种和周转额不断扩大，一九五三年我国与波兰之间的贸易额，已较一九五○年增加三倍多。中波贸易如此蓬勃地发展，不仅保证了中波两国人民在生产上和生活上日益增长的需要，而且促进了双方经济计划的实现和经济的繁荣与高涨，并巩固民主世界市场在整个世界经济中的作用。今后在我国五年计划和波兰六年计划的进行过程中，中波贸易一定将会更加有计划地稳步地继续不断增长起来，深刻体现其沟通双方经济计划上的联系作用和保证经济建设任务的顺利完成。
    中波两国人民之间的友好合作和团结互助，不仅在贸易关系上体现出来，尚且表现在其他各个方面。例如：波兰所举办的中波轮船公司，发展了中波之间海上运输关系，使双方出口货物定期装运于黄海到波罗的海之间，并保证了我国与东欧各兄弟国家之间贸易协定的贯彻，粉碎了美帝国主义对我国“封锁”、“禁运”的阴谋。在文化交流方面，缔结了中波文化合作协定，组成了中波文化合作联合委员会。去年我国派赴东欧人民民主国家文化教育考察团曾赴波兰作了友好的访问；今年我国并派遣文化代表团赴波兰参加制订中波文化合作协定一九五三年执行计划，进一步加强中波两国在文化、科学、艺术等方面的合作。今年四月间，波兰“玛佐夫舍”歌舞团来到我国演出，受到我国广大人民热烈的欢迎和赞扬，更进一步巩固了中波两国人民之间的兄弟般的友谊。最近中波两国为了响应世界和平理事会的号召，纪念波兰伟大的科学家哥白尼和中国伟大的爱国诗人屈原所进行的讲演、介绍等活动，也将增进中波人民之间的相互了解。这次波兰人民共和国经济展览会的展出，又使我们对人民波兰解放以来在经济上的巨大成就以及工业生产的发展情况，有了更加全面的深刻的认识，我们可以从中观摩学习到波兰人民在实行计划经济建设中的先进经验，帮助我们更好地完成我们的五年计划经济建设。
    在我们稳步走向繁荣和富强的社会主义道路上，我们将坚持不渝地贯彻毛主席的指示：“在这个远大目标上，在国外，我们必须坚固地团结苏联、各新民主国家及全世界一切和平民主力量，对此不可有丝毫的游移和动摇。”不断加强中波两国人民的经济合作和友好互助，共同为保卫世界和平与建设美好的未来而斗争，向着新的更大的胜利携手前进！
