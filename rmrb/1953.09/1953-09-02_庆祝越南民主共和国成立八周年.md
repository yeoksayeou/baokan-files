Celebrating the Eighth Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

This year, on September 2nd, the Vietnamese people celebrate the eighth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the offspring of the victory of the August Revolution, a victory obtained thanks to the historic victory of the glorious Soviet Red Army in defeating Japanese fascism.

Therefore, every National Day, the Vietnamese people naturally think of the kindness of the great Soviet Union—the supporter of the oppressed nations of the world—and express their infinite gratitude.

Looking back at the path taken by the national liberation movement since World War I, the Vietnamese people clearly see how they received great help from the October Revolution. At the same time, they also clearly see that the Chinese revolution and the Vietnamese revolution are closely linked, and that the Chinese revolution was also greatly influenced by the great October Revolution.

Looking to the future, the Vietnamese people clearly see that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is closely united with the countries of the peaceful and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union. The peaceful and democratic camp is stronger than the imperialist camp that provokes war, and it is growing stronger day by day. Therefore, the victory of the Vietnamese people's resistance war is inevitable. The Vietnamese people are marching towards a bright future with confidence.

The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is eight years old.

Since the day the people's democratic regime was established, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has resolutely fought to resist imperialist aggressors for eight years. It was born in the flames of battle and is growing stronger in battle. Its history is the history of the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people.

After the establishment of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, it promulgated a series of decrees that laid the cornerstone of the people's democratic regime, such as: guaranteeing freedom and democracy, an eight-hour working day, implementing rent reduction, establishing people's representative conferences and administrative committees, organizing universal suffrage, and establishing the National Assembly. At the same time, the government called on the people of the whole country to rise up to overcome famine, eliminate illiteracy, and resist foreign aggressors.

In this way, from the very first day of creating the people's democratic regime, the Vietnamese people saw clearly that this new regime was established after destroying the combined rule of the dirty colonial regime and the decadent Hue Dynasty. It is a regime that fully reflects the people's nature, conforms to the people's urgent demands for independence, freedom, democracy, and a better life, as well as the desire for extensive material and cultural development. Therefore, people from all walks of life are closely united around the government, with ardent feelings and confidence in the government. This is the source of the indestructible strength shown by the people's democratic regime throughout the past war of resistance and in the difficult days when the enemy attacked us.

To fight for the independence, freedom, and democracy of the motherland is to fight against imperialism and feudalism. This is the slogan put forward by the Communist Party of Indochina since its establishment in January 1930. This slogan has encouraged the broad masses of the people to carry out a long-term struggle, and won the victory of the August Revolution under the historic and decisive victory of the Soviet Union in defeating Japanese fascism.

Today, the Lao Dong Party also leads the Vietnamese people with this slogan to resist the aggression of French and American imperialists and their lackeys—the puppet governments of Bao Dai and Nguyen Van Tam—agents of the reactionary feudal landlords and comprador groups.

In his message calling on the people of the whole country to resist the war, President Ho Chi Minh clearly explained to the people why the war of resistance must be long-term and arduous, but is bound to be victorious.

The facts of the past few years have fully demonstrated that President Ho Chi Minh's words are completely correct; it also fully proves that the heroic sacrifices of the Vietnamese people have brought them many significant victories, and have further laid a solid foundation for future victories.

On September 23, 1945, three weeks after the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declared its independence, French troops suddenly occupied Saigon with the support of British imperialist troops. The French colonialists' long-planned war of aggression began from then on. It was met with fierce resistance from the people of the South, armed with bamboo spears and sticks.

While preparing to occupy the entire territory of Vietnam, the French colonialists also proposed negotiations to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. But this was just a means to buy time for aggression, trying to make us relax our vigilance, so as to take the opportunity to launch a surprise attack on us. Although we had made every effort in the negotiations, the negotiations ultimately failed. When the two sides were negotiating in Fontainebleau, the French aggressor troops attacked us on battlefields across the country, attempting to gain an advantage and prepare to occupy the entire territory of Vietnam. The national war of resistance began on December 19, 1946.

We must look back at that stage to prove how despicable and insincere the imperialist aggressors were. There is no doubt that we must be vigilant against the imperialists at all times. They will not be willing to accept lessons until they are completely defeated and until the world peace movement can completely stop their evil clutches. We must force them to accept peace.

The French colonialists launched the war arrogantly at that time because they miscalculated, thinking that they could win victory as quickly as lightning. Based on this dream, they launched an attack on Viet Bac at the end of 1947, attempting to end the war in one battle. But as is well known, this attack only brought serious defeat and shameful rout to the war provokers. This was the first major military victory of the Vietnamese People's Army and the entire people. This victory ended the first stage of the Vietnamese war of resistance—the stage of enemy attack.

Three years later, the Vietnamese People's Army took the initiative to launch attacks on the enemy's solid strongholds in Cao Bang, Lang Son, and Lao Cai, and achieved great victories, driving the enemy out of most of the land along the Sino-Vietnamese border. This was the second great victory of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance. This victory is called the Border Campaign Victory at the end of 1950.

After the enemy retreated to the plains, they tried every means to avoid attacks by our army, and prepared to launch an offensive in order to seize military initiative. The enemy recklessly advanced into Hoa Binh province at the end of 1951, but this attack was again crushed. In this campaign, our army wiped out a part of the enemy's active forces in the plains, opening up the way for us to expand guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines.

At the end of 1952, the Vietnamese People's Army launched an offensive against the enemy strongholds in Nghia Lo, Son La, and other places in the Northwest region. The People's Army quickly launched battles against the enemy in a vast area, surrounded the Na San stronghold (Editor's note: The Vietnamese People's Army liberated Na San on August 11 this year), and almost liberated the entire area inhabited by the Thai people.

At the beginning of 1953, the enemy suffered another heavy blow on the battlefield in northern Laos. The Lao Liberation Army attacked the enemy everywhere and liberated vast areas of land.

Thanks to this series of victories, a total of 130,000 square kilometers of land were liberated (90,000 square kilometers in northern Vietnam and 40,000 square kilometers in northern Laos), not counting the liberated areas behind enemy lines.

The enemy's most serious losses are primarily in personnel and equipment. According to incomplete statistics, from December 19, 1946 to July 20, 1953, the People's Army wiped out a total of 281,341 enemy troops. Among them, 217,730 were killed. The People's Army captured 81,894 rifles and machine guns, 850 artillery pieces and mortars, 92 trucks, and thousands of tons of ammunition and equipment. It destroyed 242 enemy aircraft, 5,712 tanks, armored vehicles and trucks, 370 steamships and landing craft, 1,000 locomotives and carriages, and a large amount of other military equipment.

Everyone can see clearly how much the enemy has paid in this war of aggression. Even the official French newspapers have had to admit this fact: this war has consumed some of the most elite units and 40 percent of the non-commissioned officers in the French army, damaged France's financial economy, caused France to lose its "prestige" and "status" in the international arena, and made it appear weak in the face of a rearmed, revanchist West Germany, while also increasingly turning France into a vassal of American imperialism. Despite this, each reactionary French cabinet has insisted on carrying out this dirty war of aggression, regardless of the unanimous desire of the entire French people to withdraw the French expeditionary force from Vietnam, and regardless of the increasingly strong protests from public opinion. It is clear that these reactionary governments are not following France's own political line, but rather the political line of the United States, which is to expand the war, invade Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and turn these three countries into a springboard for aggression against the People's Republic of China.

Therefore, the failure of the French colonialists is tantamount to the failure of the American interventionists. The United States supplied the French army with a large amount of weapons and ammunition, and tried to control the command of the war. The purpose of the United States' intervention is, on the one hand, to suppress the Vietnamese people's national liberation struggle, and on the other hand, to intervene in Vietnam's military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, in order to replace France's dominant position in Vietnam.

Faced with the imperialist aggressors, the Vietnamese people have successfully waged a war of resistance for eight years, and will continue to work hard to achieve final victory.

Wherever the imperialist aggressive bloc goes, it will be fatally hit. This is true in China and Korea, it has been true in Vietnam in the past, and it will be true in the future.

Of course, these victories are achieved through a high degree of fighting will and a spirit of heroic sacrifice. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people fight with courageous battles and unwavering confidence and steadfast will. Because they deeply know that only in this way can they defeat the enemy and achieve complete victory.

Today, we are much stronger than at the beginning of the war of resistance, and we will be even stronger, giving the enemy even heavier blows. In order to achieve the strengthening of the war of resistance, our people have been working hard for several years; the reason why our strength has increased is that we have made progress in military, political, economic, and ideological work. Let us now outline these aspects of work and achievements.

Strengthening the fighting power of the People's Army

Based on the scientific military thinking of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong, we attach great importance to the construction of the armed forces for the war of resistance. We are training it into a powerful People's Army in terms of organization and equipment, supply and technology, especially in terms of spirit. It is an army that is completely loyal to the people and the interests of the revolution. Since strengthening political education in the army last year, the political and ideological levels of combatants and commanders have been raised a step further. This is a major achievement in strengthening the People's Army. But this is only a beginning, and we must constantly consolidate the results we have achieved, and move forward on this basis.

Based on ideological improvement, Vietnamese troops have quickly learned the techniques applicable to the people's and revolutionary army in military training. Now, they can flexibly and effectively fight the enemy in the plains or in the rugged mountains, and they can steadily carry out mobile warfare. They have also made considerable progress in attacking enemy strongholds and solid defense systems.

Of course, we are still insufficient in terms of equipment. However, due to the People's Army's activeness and fearless spirit in combat, as well as having combat techniques suitable for the People's Army, it is superior to the enemy. The enemy has also had to admit this advantage. Whenever the enemy thinks of fighting our army, they shrink back and their ranks are chaotic, so that they are annihilated or captured.

Most of the soldiers in our troops are peasants who have put on military uniforms. They warmly support the land policy of the Party and the government, and actively support the peasants' struggle against feudal landlords. They recognize the significance of their fight, so they fight bravely in every battle. At the same time, the unity between the army and the people is even closer.

Economic achievements and new tasks

In the past two years, especially last year, various economic sectors in our country have made many efforts to solve financial difficulties and meet the increasing needs of the war of resistance.

Thanks to the patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, especially the peasants, who actively paid agricultural taxes, we have achieved good results. Since the beginning of this year, we have achieved a balance of payments, overcome inflation, stabilized the currency value, and stabilized the prices of various major necessities, especially rice, which has brought favorable conditions for the development of production and trade.

At present, developing production (agriculture, handicrafts, light industry) is the central task in our economic activities. This will lay a more solid material foundation for raising the living standards of people of all strata, enhancing the strength of the war of resistance, and ensuring long-term war of resistance.

To this day, some of our agencies and cadres still underestimate the importance of this task, which is a mistake.

Even so, the people are actively involved in the production and saving movement, and have achieved good results in some areas. If we can strengthen leadership and organization in production, we will achieve better results nationwide.

We have two superior conditions for achieving this important task: first, the stability of finance, currency, and prices; second, the new land policy has opened the way for liberating all productive forces in rural areas and developing the national economy.

At the same time, we must develop domestic and foreign trade and trade in enemy-occupied areas. The purpose is also to develop production.

The National Bank and state-owned trading institutions are two important sectors of the national economy. They play a leading role in the national economy. Therefore, we must work hard to promote the activities of these two sectors.

Achievements in cadre training

Since last year, the Party has paid special attention to a work of important political significance, which is to run training classes for cultivating cadres to improve their ideological level. At present, this work has basically been completed; most cadres of the Party, government, army, and people's organizations from the central to the county level have received such training. On basic issues, such as the tasks of the Vietnamese revolution against imperialism and feudalism, class stand, the leading role of the working class in the revolution, the situation and tasks of Vietnam's long-term self-reliant war of resistance, mobilizing the peasant masses to implement the land policy, the cadres' sense of responsibility for work and understanding of discipline, the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, etc., the cadres' level of understanding has been improved.

The organization of training classes at all levels and the improvement of the ideological level of cadres are political achievements. These achievements have made the Party, the government, the army, and the people's organizations more sound ideologically and politically. These achievements have brought significant effects in implementing the tasks put forward by the Party and the government, in consolidating the unity of the Party, in consolidating the unity between Party members and non-Party members, and in consolidating the ties between the Party and the people of all strata. From now until the end of the year, we must continue to run training classes for some cadres of the Party, government, and people's organizations to complete the cadre training plan.

The improvement of the ideological and political level of cadres will bring good influence to our war of resistance and revolutionary cause.

Mobilizing the peasant masses to implement the land policy

The central task of the Party and the government in the liberated areas is to mobilize the peasant masses to implement the land policy, and currently it is to thoroughly reduce rent. This is the concrete realization of the slogan of anti-feudal struggle. This is a struggle carried out step by step after detailed investigation and research, on the basis of class division in rural areas and under steady and correct leadership. It will steadily achieve the goal of "land to the tiller," that is, abolish the land ownership of feudal landlords, realize the land ownership of peasants, and achieve the liberation of rural productive forces, opening up a broad road for the development of the national economy.

At present, there is an urgent purpose for mobilizing the peasant masses, which is to limit feudal exploitation, meet some of the material needs of the peasants, establish the peasants' political dominance, adjust various leadership organizations in rural areas, expand and consolidate the national united front, develop production and enhance all aspects of work in the war of resistance.

The implementation of the above-mentioned policies can improve the living standards and political awareness of the main force in the war of resistance—millions of peasants—thereby effectively consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. This will consolidate the rear, promote the combat enthusiasm of the soldiers, and enhance the masses' trust in the Party and the government.

This policy is completely in line with the interests of the people and the country, and completely in line with the development law of Vietnamese society, where strong feudal remnants still exist economically. Therefore, this policy is not only warmly welcomed by the working peasants, but also supported by people of all strata and various democratic parties. This is a basic condition for determining the victory of the land policy.

Mobilizing the peasant masses to implement the land policy is a fierce and complex class struggle. We are carrying out this struggle in the environment of the war of resistance. Therefore, we must firmly remember the teachings of President Ho Chi Minh. He taught us that leadership must be correct, steady, and cautious. It is a long-term struggle. In the process of the struggle, we will gain more training, thereby cultivating cadres, strengthening leadership, and gradually expanding and deepening this struggle from the existing foundation. In recent months, we have conducted key experiments in several villages, and in the near future, this movement will be popularized everywhere.

At the present stage, our revolutionary task is to oppose imperialism and oppose feudalism. Destroying the feudal system and eliminating all feudal remnants is the most urgent desire of the peasant masses. However, the anti-feudal struggle must be combined with the anti-imperialist struggle. The experience of the Vietnamese revolutionary movement and the experience of the Vietnamese eight-year war of resistance have clearly proven this truth. This is in line with the revolutionary line pointed out by Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong for colonial countries.

Consolidating the people's regime

In recent years, we have repeatedly mentioned that we must consolidate the people's regime on the basis of the unity of people of all strata and various democratic parties, especially on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance, and under the leadership of the working class and its party—the Vietnam Workers' Party. At present, we must take practical action.

Our war of resistance relies on the peasants and the countryside. Our regime must also do so. However, in recent years, most of the land in the countryside is still occupied by landlords. In many areas, the regime is still controlled by landlords, local bullies, and evil gentry. Most seriously, reactionary landlords use their economic and political advantages to collude with the enemy, sabotage the war of resistance, and attempt to plant bombs inside the people's regime.

Therefore, in terms of politics, we must mobilize the peasants, defeat the political status of landlords, local bullies, and evil gentry, establish the political dominance of working peasants, and further prepare to create favorable conditions for the ideological and organizational adjustment of the people's regime at the village level. For example, we have reorganized the village's war resistance administrative committee, public security agencies, and guerrilla organizations, and then we have gradually reorganized the village's people's congress. We have carried out these tasks in villages where the peasant masses have been mobilized, and have initially achieved good results. In these places, the peasants have become masters of their own affairs, and the poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants are closely united, controlling the war resistance administrative committee, controlling the institutions that protect social order, and the organization of the guerrillas. This means that they have taken control of the regime, the armed forces, and the judiciary in the village. This is the people's regime. The peasants who have been oppressed for centuries have now turned over.

This is a correct path, because it is based on the basic principles of Vietnam's rectification and consolidation of the people's regime. But this is only the first step. On the solid foundation that the people's regime in the village is in the hands of the peasants and the working people, we will gradually rectify the people's regime at other levels.

Due to the mobilization of the peasant masses, we were able to expose the conspiracies of reactionary landlords and bullies in a timely manner, and severely punish them with revolutionary discipline. Only the people of all strata participating in the struggle can timely expose and suppress all kinds of ugly and serious crimes, such as: acting as intelligence agents for the enemy, organizing spy networks, sabotaging the war of resistance, opposing the people's regime and opposing the war of resistance, opposing the government's policies, carrying out slander, and so on. In some areas, they carry out various evil activities under the guise of religion.

Destroying the political dominance of the landlord class, suppressing Vietnamese traitors, reactionary landlords, and bullies, and establishing the political dominance of the peasants and the working people are basic conditions for building the people's regime at the village level.

From the above, we can see that the Vietnamese people, the Party, and the government are actively working hard to consolidate and strengthen the strength of the war of resistance. In recent years, especially since last year, we have achieved significant achievements in military, economic, ideological, especially in land policy. All of this has laid the foundation for a patriotic long-term war of resistance and final victory.

This is not to say that we have no loopholes, weaknesses, and mistakes; no, we have had them in the past, and we still have them now. Sometimes, we have even had serious mistakes in the work of land policy, consolidating the people's democratic regime, training cadres, developing guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, developing production, raising people's living standards, and organizing people's organizations, etc. President Ho Chi Minh often teaches us to resolutely overcome these shortcomings and mistakes. Criticism and self-criticism have been fully developed in various training classes, and have played a good role. Now, we have found out the shortcomings and found ways to overcome them, and in the future, we will move forward steadily on the correct path and achieve better results.

This year, the Vietnamese people are celebrating the eighth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in an extremely joyful and uplifting atmosphere. The Vietnamese people deeply know that the war of resistance is long-term and arduous, and they have overcome great difficulties in the past and will continue to overcome them in the future. They realize that these are the inevitable difficulties in the development process of any great cause, so they are determined to overcome them.

Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people are uniting with the strong forces of the peaceful and democratic camp to resolutely fight for the independence and freedom of the motherland, defend peace, and attack the imperialist aggressors and their servants and puppets.

We firmly believe that final victory must belong to the Vietnamese people!

    庆祝越南民主共和国成立八周年
    越南民主共和国副总理  范文同
    今年九月二日，越南人民庆祝越南民主共和国成立八周年纪念。越南民主共和国是八月革命胜利的产儿，这个胜利是由于光荣的苏联红军击败了日本法西斯的历史性的胜利而获得的。
    因此，每逢国庆节，越南人民便自然地想起伟大的苏联——世界上被压迫民族的支持者——的恩德，并表示无限感激。
    回顾自第一次世界大战以来的民族解放运动所走过的路程，越南人民清楚地看到他们如何得到十月革命的极大的帮助。同时他们也清楚地看到中国革命和越南革命有着密切的联系，而中国革命也受到伟大的十月革命的巨大影响。
    展望将来，越南人民清楚地看到越南民主共和国是和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营国家紧密地团结在一起的。和平民主阵营比挑拨战争的帝国主义阵营强大，而且日益壮大。因此，越南人民抗战的胜利是必然的。越南人民正满怀信心地走向美好的未来。
    越南民主共和国已八周岁了
    自建立人民民主政权那天开始，八年来，越南民主共和国坚决地为反抗帝国主义侵略者而战斗。它在战斗的火焰中诞生，也正在战斗中壮大。它的历史就是越南人民英勇抗战的历史。
    越南民主共和国政府成立后，在胡志明主席的领导下，颁布了一系列的奠立人民民主政权基石的法令，例如：保证自由民主，八小时工作制，实行减租，成立人民代表会议和行政委员会，组织普选，成立国民议会。同时，政府号召全国人民起来战胜饥荒，扫除文盲，反抗外国侵略者。
    正是这样，从缔造人民民主政权的头一天起，越南人民看清了这个新政权是在摧毁了肮脏的殖民地政权与腐朽的顺化王朝的联合统治之后而建立起来的。它是一个充分表现人民性，符合人民迫切要求独立、自由、民主和美好的生活，以及物质与文化的广泛发展等愿望的政权。因此，各阶层的人民紧紧地团结在政府的周围，对政府怀着热烈的感情和信心。这是人民民主政权在过去整个抗战过程中以及敌人向我们进攻的困难日子里所表现的坚不可摧的力量的泉源。
    为争取祖国的独立和自由民主而斗争，即是为反对帝国主义反对封建主义而斗争。这是东洋共产党自一九三○年一月成立之日起就提出了的口号。这个口号鼓舞了广大人民群众进行了长期的斗争，并在苏联击败日本法西斯的具有历史性与决定性胜利的条件下获得了八月革命的胜利。
    今天，劳动党同样以这个口号领导越南人民抗击法、美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗——保大、阮文心傀儡政府——反动的封建地主和买办集团的代理人。
    胡志明主席在号召全国人民抗战的文告中曾明确地向人民作过解释，使他们了解到为什么抗战必须是长期的艰苦的，但一定取得胜利的原因。
    过去几年的事实充分说明了胡志明主席的话是完全正确的；也充分证明了越南人民的英勇牺牲已为他们自己带来许多重大的胜利，并进而为未来的胜利打好了基础。
    一九四五年九月二十三日，即越南民主共和国宣布独立的三个星期之后，法军在英帝国主义军队的支持下突然侵占西贡市。法国殖民者蓄谋已久的侵略战争从此开始。它遭到以竹矛、棍棒为武器的南部人民的猛烈抗击。
    法国殖民者在准备侵占越南全国的同时，并向越南民主共和国政府提出谈判的建议。但这只是试图争取时间来进行侵略的一种手段，想使我们放松警惕，以便伺机向我们进行突袭。虽然在谈判中我们曾作过一切努力，但谈判终告失败。当双方在封腾布罗进行谈判的时候，法国侵略军竟在全国各战场上向我们袭击，妄图争取优势，准备侵占越南整个领土。全国抗战就在一九四六年十二月十九日开始了。
    我们必须回顾过去那个阶段，以证明帝国主义侵略者是多么卑鄙和没有诚意。毫无疑问，我们在任何时候都要对帝国主义者提高警惕。在他们还没有完全失败的时候，在世界和平运动还未能完全制止他们罪恶的魔手的时候，他们是不甘心接受教训的。我们必须强迫它们来接受和平。
    法国殖民者当时狂妄地发动战争，是因为他们打错了算盘，他们以为能像闪电那样迅速地获得胜利。基于这个梦想，他们在一九四七年底向越北发动进攻，妄图在一次战役中结束战争。但如众所周知，这次进攻只给战争挑拨者招来了严重的失败和可耻的溃退。这是越南人民军和全体人民在军事上的第一次大胜利。这个胜利结束了越南抗战的第一个阶段——敌人进攻的阶段。
    三年后，越南人民军主动向高平、谅山和老街等地坚固的敌军据点展开攻击，并获得巨大胜利，把敌军从中、越边境的大部分土地上驱逐出去。这是越南人民抗战的第二次大胜利。这个胜利称为一九五○年年底边境大捷。
    敌军撤到平原地区后，用尽办法企图避开我军的攻击，并准备展开一个攻势以便争取军事上的主动权。敌军于一九五一年底向和平省冒进，但这次进攻又被粉碎了。在这次战役中，我军歼灭了敌军在平原地区的一部分有生力量，给我们在敌后扩展游击战开辟了道路。
    一九五二年底，越南人民军向盘踞在西北地区的义路、山萝等敌据点展开攻势。人民军在广阔的地区迅速地对敌展开战斗，包围那产据点（编者按：越南人民军已于今年八月十一日解放那产），几乎解放了泰族人民聚居的全部地区。
    一九五三年初，敌人又在寮国北部的战线上遭受重创。寮国解放军到处打击敌军并解放了辽阔的土地。
    由于这一系列的胜利，一共解放了十三万平方公里的土地（越南北部九万平方公里，寮国北部四万平方公里），敌后的解放地区还未计算在内。
    敌人最严重的损失首先是兵员和装备方面的损失。据不完全的统计，自一九四六年十二月十九日起至一九五三年七月二十日止，人民军共歼敌二十八万一千三百四十一人。其中打死二十一万七千七百三十人。人民军缴获步枪和机枪八万一千八百九十四支，大炮和迫击炮八百五十门，卡车九十二辆，弹药和装备数千吨。击毁敌机二百四十二架，坦克、装甲车和卡车共五千七百一十二辆，汽船和登陆艇三百七十艘，火车头和车厢一千个以及大量的其他军事装备。
    谁都看得清楚，敌人在侵略战争中付出了多么大的代价。法国官方报纸也不得不承认这个事实：这个战争消耗了法国军队中的一些最精锐的单位和百分之四十的士官，破坏了法国的财政经济，使法国失去了在国际上的“威信”和“地位”，并在重新武装的、复仇主义的西德面前显得荏弱，同时使法国日益变为美帝国主义的附庸。尽管如此，每一届反动的法国内阁仍都主张进行这个肮脏的侵略战争，而不顾到法国全体人民一致要求把法国远征军撤出越南的愿望，也不顾到日益强烈的舆论的抗议。人们明显地看到这些反动的政府不是遵循着法国自己的政治路线而是遵循着美国的政治路线，即美国妄图扩大战争，侵占越南、高棉和寮国，变这三个国家为侵略人民中国的跳板的政治路线。
    因此，法国殖民者的失败无异是美国干涉者的失败。美国供应了法军大量军火，并力图操纵战争的指挥权。美国进行干涉的目的，一方面是妄图镇压越南人民的民族解放斗争，一方面也想插手到越南的军事、政治、经济和文化各方面，以取代法国在越南的统治地位。
    面对着帝国主义侵略者，越南人民八年来胜利地进行着抗战，并将继续努力取得最后的胜利。
    帝国主义侵略集团无论到那里，都遭到致命的打击。在中国和朝鲜是如此，在越南过去是如此，将来也是如此。
    当然，这些胜利是由于高度的战斗意志和壮烈的牺牲精神而获得的。在胡志明主席的领导下，越南人民以英勇的战斗和刚毅的信心及坚定不移的意志来进行战斗。因为他们深深知道，只有这样才能战胜敌人和取得完全胜利。
    今天我们已经比抗战初期强大得多，我们还要更强大，予敌人以更沉重的痛击。为了达到增强抗战的力量，我国人民几年来都在坚持努力；我们的力量之所以增强是我们在军事、政治、经济、思想诸方面的工作都取得了进展的结果。下面让我们来概述这几方面的工作和成绩。
    增强人民军的战斗力量
    根据列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的科学的军事思想，我们极重视抗战武装力量的建设。我们在组织和装备，供应和技术各方面，尤其是在精神方面，把它培养成为一支力量雄厚的人民军。它是一支完全忠于人民和革命利益的军队。从去年在军队中加强政治教育以来，战斗员和指挥员的政治水平和思想水平又提高了一步。这是增强人民军力量的一个重大的成就。但这只是一个开端，我们还要不断地巩固已获得的成果，并在这个基础上前进。
    基于思想上的提高，越南部队在军事训练中很快地就学会了适用于人民和革命军队的技术。现在，他们可以灵活而有效地在平原地区，或在险峻的山区打击敌人，他们可以稳步地展开运动战。他们在攻击敌军据点和坚固的防御体系的战斗中也有长足的进步。
    当然，在装备方面我们还是不够的。可是由于人民军在战斗中的积极性和大无畏的精神，以及有着适合于人民军队的战斗技术，因而它比敌人占优势。敌军也不得不承认这个优势。每逢敌军想到要和我军作战时，他们就畏缩不前，阵容混乱，以致被歼或被俘。
    我们部队中的战士多数是穿上军衣的农民。他们热烈支持党和政府的土地政策，而且积极地支持农民们对封建地主所作的斗争。他们认识到他们战斗的意义，因此在每次战斗中都勇敢作战。同时军民之间的团结也更加紧密了。
    在经济方面的成就和新的任务
    两年来，特别是在去年，我国经济各部门曾经作过不少努力，以解决财政方面的困难，并满足抗战日益增加的需要。
    由于全国人民的爱国热忱，特别是农民们，他们积极完纳农业税，所以我们获得很好的成果。从今年初开始，我们已达到了收支平衡，克服了通货膨胀，稳定了币值，使各种主要的生活必需品，尤其是大米的价格稳定下来，这就为发展生产和贸易带来了顺利的条件。
    目前发展生产（农业、手工业、轻工业）是我们经济活动中的中心任务。这是将为提高各阶层人民生活水平、增强抗战力量、保证长期抗战进一步奠定更加稳固的物质基础。
    时至今日，我们的一些机关和干部仍然低估了这个任务的重要性，这是一个错误。
    虽然如此，人民仍积极投入生产节约运动中，并在若干地区获得了良好的结果。如果我们能在生产方面加强领导和组织，我们将在全国范围内获得更好的成就。
    我们对于实现这个重要的任务，具备着两个优越的条件：第一，财政、货币和物价的稳定；第二，新的土地政策为解放农村中的一切生产力和发展国家经济开辟了道路。
    与此同时，我们必须发展国内外和对敌占区的贸易。其目的也是为了发展生产。
    国家银行和国营贸易机构是国家经济的两个重要部门。它在国家经济中起着领导作用。因此，我们必须努力促进这两个部门的活动。
    培养干部方面的成就
    从去年以来，党特别注意到一个具有重要政治意义的工作，这就是开办培养干部的训练班以提高他们的思想水平。目前这个工作基本上已告完成；从中央到县级的党、政、军和人民团体的大部分干部，都受过这样的训练。在基本问题上，例如，对越南革命的反对帝国主义反对封建主义的任务、阶级立场、工人阶级在革命中的领导作用、越南长期的自力更生的抗战的形势与任务、发动农民群众实现土地政策、干部对工作的负责精神和对纪律的认识、反对贪污浪费和官僚主义的斗争等等，干部的认识水平都提高了。
    组织各级训练班和干部思想水平的提高，都是政治方面的成就。这些成就使党、政府、军队和人民团体在思想上、政治上更为健全起来。这些成就已在执行党和政府所提出的任务，在巩固党的统一，在巩固党员与非党员之间的团结，在巩固党和各阶层人民之间的联系等方面，带来了显著的效果。从现在到年底，我们必须继续给党、政府和人民团体的一些干部开办训练班，以完成培养干部的计划。
    干部的思想水平和政治水平的提高将给我们的抗战和革命事业带来良好的影响。
    发动农民群众实现土地政策
    党和政府在解放区的中心任务是发动农民群众实现土地政策，目前就是彻底减租。这是反封建斗争口号的具体实现。这是经过详细调查研究、在农村中划分阶级的基础上和在稳健的正确的领导下、有步骤进行的斗争。它将稳步地达到实现“耕者有其田”的目的，就是说废除封建地主的土地占有制，实现农民的土地所有制，达到解放农村生产力，给国家经济的发展开辟一条宽广的道路。
    目前，发动农民群众有一个迫切的目的是限制封建性的剥削，满足农民物质上的一部分需要，确立农民在政治上的优势地位，调整农村中各种领导机构，扩大和巩固民族统一战线，发展生产和增强抗战中各方面的工作。
    实现了上述的政策，就可以使抗战中的主要力量——千百万的农民的生活水平得到提高，政治认识也得到提高，从而有效地巩固工农联盟。这样就会巩固后方，发扬战士的战斗积极性，增强群众对党和政府的信任。
    这个政策是完全符合人民和国家的利益的，完全符合经济上还存在着浓厚的封建残余的越南社会的发展规律。所以，这个政策不但得到劳动农民热烈的欢迎，而且也得到各阶层人民和各民主党派的支持。这是决定土地政策胜利的一个基本条件。
    发动农民群众实现土地政策是一场剧烈的复杂的阶级斗争。我们是在抗战环境中进行这场斗争的。因此，我们必须牢牢记住胡志明主席的教导。他教导我们，领导必须正确、稳健和谨慎。它是一个长期的斗争。在斗争的过程中，我们将获得更多的锻炼，从而培养干部，加强领导，并逐渐地从现有基础上把这个斗争扩展和深入。近几月来，我们在若干乡村作重点试验，不久的将来，这个运动将普及各地。
    在现阶段，我们的革命任务是反对帝国主义反对封建主义。摧毁封建制度、肃清一切封建残余是农民群众一个最迫切的愿望。可是反封建的斗争必须和反帝国主义的斗争结合起来。越南革命运动的经验和越南八年抗战的经验已明确地证明了这个真理。这是符合于列宁、斯大林和毛泽东为殖民地国家所指出的革命路线的。
    巩固人民政权
    近几年来，我们反复地提到必须在各阶层人民、各民主党派团结的基础上，尤其是在工农联盟的基础上，在工人阶级及其政党——越南劳动党的领导下，把人民政权巩固起来。目前必须实际行动起来。
    我们的抗战是依靠农民和乡村的。我们的政权也必须如此。虽然如此，几年来在农村里的大部分土地仍然为地主所占有。在许多地区，政权仍操纵在地主、土豪、劣绅的手里。最严重的是，反动地主利用他们在经济上和政治上的优势和敌人勾结起来，破坏抗战，企图在人民政权的内部埋下炸药。
    因此，在政治方面，我们必须发动农民，打垮地主和土豪劣绅的政治地位，建立起劳动农民在政治上的优势地位，进而准备为村级的人民政权在思想上、组织上的调整创造顺利条件。例如，整顿村的抗战行政委员会、公安机构和游击队组织，随后我们逐步地进行整顿村的人民代表会议。这些工作，我们曾在农民群众已发动起来的村里进行过，而且初步取得良好成果。在这些地方，农民已当家做主，贫雇农和中农密切地团结在一起，掌握了抗战行政委员会，掌握了保卫社会治安的机构和游击队的组织。这就是说他们在村里已掌握了政权、武装力量和司法权。这就是人民政权。多少世纪来被压迫的农民今天已翻身了。
    这是一条正确的道路，因为它是根据越南整顿和巩固人民政权的基本原则出发的。但这只是第一步。在村的人民政权掌握在农民和劳动人民手里的稳固的基础上，我们将逐渐地来整顿其他各级的人民政权。
    由于发动农民群众，使我们能及时揭穿了反动地主和恶霸的阴谋，并以革命的纪律来严惩他们。只有各阶层的人民参加斗争才能及时地揭穿和镇压各种各样丑恶的、严重的罪行，如：给敌人作谍报、组织间谍网、破坏抗战、反对人民政权和反对抗战、反对政府的政策的活动、进行诽谤等等。在一些地区，他们披着宗教外衣进行着各种罪恶活动。
    摧毁地主阶级在政治上的优势地位，镇压越奸、反动地主和恶霸，给农民和劳动人民建立在政治上的优势地位，这都是建设村级的人民政权的基本条件。
    由上述种种情况，我们可以看出，越南人民、党和政府正为巩固和增强抗战的力量而积极努力。近几年来，特别是自去年以来，在军事、经济、思想、尤其是在土地政策等方面，我们已获得显著的成就。所有这一切，都为一个爱国主义的长期抗战和最后的胜利奠定了基础。
    这并不是说，我们完全没有漏洞、弱点和错误；不，过去我们曾经有过，目前仍然是有的。有时，我们甚至在土地政策、巩固人民民主政权、培养干部、发展敌后游击战、发展生产、提高人民生活水平以及人民团体的组织等等工作中，曾经有过严重错误。胡志明主席经常教导我们坚决克服这些缺点和错误。在各个训练班中，批评和自我批评得到充分的发展，起了很好的作用。现在，我们已找出缺点并找到如何去克服的办法，今后，我们将在正确的道路上稳步前进并取得更好的成就。
    今年，越南人民在极为愉快和振奋的气氛中来庆祝越南民主共和国成立八周年。越南人民深深知道，抗战是长期而艰苦的，过去他们已克服、将来还要继续克服巨大的困难。他们体会到这是任何伟大事业的发展过程中的必然存在的困难，因此他们决心去克服它。
    在胡志明主席的领导下，越南人民正与和平民主阵营的雄厚的力量团结在一起，为争取祖国的独立和自由，保卫和平，打击帝国主义侵略者及其仆从和傀儡而坚决斗争。
    我们深信，最后的胜利一定是属于越南人民的！
