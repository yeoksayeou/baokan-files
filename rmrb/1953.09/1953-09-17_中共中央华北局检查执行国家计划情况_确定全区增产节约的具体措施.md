Xinhua News Agency Report: To strive for the completion and overfulfillment of national plans, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting in early September to inspect the implementation of national plans in the first half of the year and to discuss specific measures for increasing production, increasing income, practicing strict economy, and tightening expenditures.

The item-by-item inspection showed that there was progress and achievement in the implementation of national plans in the first half of the year in North China's industrial and agricultural production, capital construction, commerce, and other tasks. In terms of industrial production, the total output value increased by 34.72% compared with the same period last year. In agricultural production, due to the opposition to "five excesses" in rural areas and the correction of blind advances, a new atmosphere of simplified administration and diligent people generally appeared in various regions. Other tasks such as capital construction, commerce, and cooperatives are also being actively improved. However, it must be pointed out that industrial production and capital construction have not been able to fully complete the national plan; agricultural production has been affected by floods and droughts, hail and other disasters in some areas, and the production increase plan has been affected; in commercial work, there are insufficient and untimely supply of means of production and livelihood for the people, and there are also some problems in procurement. Illegal merchants take the opportunity to operate, and many private industrial and commercial households evade taxes. The inspection also found that there is still enormous potential untapped in many enterprises and work institutions, and there are some unreasonable and unnecessary expenses. Therefore, the meeting believed that to solve the series of problems currently facing us, we must further tap potential, increase production, increase national income, calculate accurately, practice strict economy, and tighten expenditures. As long as we adopt a positive attitude, rely on the masses, and earnestly seek solutions, we can definitely complete and overfulfill the national plan.

The meeting discussed the measures to be taken in several major tasks in the future. The meeting unanimously agreed that the key to the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of the industrial production plan lies in the Party Committee strengthening specific leadership and giving play to the Party's guaranteeing and supervisory role over industrial and mining enterprises. The main method is for the provincial and municipal Party committees to effectively inspect the implementation of national plans by factories and mines, trace the main reasons for the failure to complete the plan in the first half of the year at each level, and formulate methods to overcome them, so as to guarantee the victorious completion and overfulfillment of the national plan with a new spirit. The North China Bureau will soon send a group of capable cadres, led by responsible comrades, to go deep into factories and mines for inspection.

The meeting believed that in agricultural production, all Party members must be mobilized to do a good job in the autumn harvest and wheat planting. In order to save grain consumption, organs and troops should save one or two taels of grain per person per day and eat 30% coarse grains. It is also necessary to advocate saving grain among farmers and conduct mutual aid and famine preparedness education.

The meeting believed that the main task of commercial work is to vigorously organize material exchanges and complete the procurement plan. When carrying out these tasks, we must pay attention to vigorously improving management, accelerating capital turnover, and reducing circulation costs to ensure the completion of the profit delivery plan. Therefore, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives must pay attention to unifying steps, rationally arranging the market, and correctly grasping price policies. Party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership over this work, criticize the bourgeois ideology existing in some Party member cadres, and expose and punish those illegal private merchants' speculation and profiteering activities according to law. In tax work, tax evasion by private industrial and commercial households must be eliminated.

The meeting also believed that in terms of practicing strict economy and tightening expenditures, we must first reduce administrative expenses, no longer increase staffing, and, where possible, gradually streamline in a planned manner. All units should conduct a serious inspection of their own income and expenditure plans, overcome waste, and resolutely reduce unnecessary parts.

Since the meeting, since the beginning of September, factories and mines in various parts of North China have generally been engaged in a tide of formulating plans and improving work. The organs at the North China level have found many reasonable and economical methods from calculating income and expenditure, and have avoided many unnecessary wastes. The material supply and marketing conference currently being held in North China and the industrial work conference that has already been held have provided many specific methods related to increasing production and practicing economy.

    中共中央华北局检查执行国家计划情况
    确定全区增产节约的具体措施
    【新华社讯】为争取完成和超额完成国家计划，中共中央华北局在九月上旬召开会议，检查上半年执行国家计划的情形，并讨论了增加生产，增加收入，厉行节约，紧缩开支的具体措施。
    在逐一检查中表明：华北工农业生产、基本建设、商业等各项工作上半年执行国家计划中是有进步有成绩的。工业生产方面，生产总值比去年同期增加了百分之三十四点七二；农业生产上由于在农村中反对了“五多”，纠正了盲目冒进，各地普遍出现了政简民勤的新气象；其他基本建设、商业、合作社等工作，也都在积极改进中。但必须指出的是：工业生产和基本建设，没有能全面完成国家计划；农业生产因部分地区发生了水患和旱、雹等灾害，增产计划受到影响；商业工作上，对人民生产资料和生活资料的供应有不足和不及时的现象，收购方面也存在若干问题，不法商人乘机活动，不少私营工商户有偷税漏税行为。检查中又发现很多企业和工作机构中还有巨大的潜力未被利用，并有若干不合理、不必要的开支。因之，会议认为：要解决当前所面临的这一系列的问题，就必须进一步发掘潜力，增加生产，增加国家收入，精确计算，厉行节约，紧缩开支。只要采取积极态度，依靠群众，认真寻求办法，一定可以完成和超额完成国家计划。
    会议讨论了今后在几项主要工作上所应采取的措施。会议一致认为：工业生产计划的全面完成和超额完成，其关键在于党委加强具体领导，发挥党对工矿企业的保证监督作用。主要办法是省、市党委切实检查厂矿执行国家计划的情形，层层追查前半年未完成计划的主要原因，订出克服的办法，以新的精神来保证胜利完成和超额完成国家计划。华北局即将派出一批得力干部，由负责同志带领深入厂矿进行检查。
    会议认为：在农业生产方面，必须动员全体党员，抓紧做好秋收和种麦工作。为了节约粮食的消费，机关、部队应当做到每人每日节约一两粮食和吃百分之三十的粗粮。在农民中也应当提倡节约粮食，进行互济备荒教育。
    会议认为：商业工作的主要任务是大力组织物资交流，完成收购计划。在进行这些工作时必须注意大力改善经营，加速资金周转，降低流转费用，以保证完成上缴利润计划。因而国营商业部门和合作社就必须注意统一步调，合理安排市场并正确掌握价格政策。各级党委要加强对这一工作的领导，批判某些党员干部中所存在的资产阶级思想，揭发和依法惩治那些不法私商的投机倒把行为。在税务工作中要杜绝私营工商户的偷税漏税行为。
    会议还认为：在厉行节约、紧缩开支方面，首先缩减行政费用，不再增加编制，并在可能条件下，有计划地逐步进行精简。各单位对于自己的收支计划，要认真做一次检查，克服浪费，坚决削减不必要的部分。
    这次会议以后，从九月初以来，华北各地厂矿已普遍投入制订计划、改进工作的热潮中。华北一级各机关从计算收支中找出许多合理节约的办法，避免了不少不必要的浪费。华北区正在举行的物资供销会议和已开过的工业工作会议，都提供了许多有关增产节约的具体办法。
