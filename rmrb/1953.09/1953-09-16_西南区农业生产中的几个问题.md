Several Problems in Agricultural Production in the Southwest Region
Li Dengying, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

In the vast rural areas of the Southwest Region, under the leadership of the Party and the government, after more than three years of arduous struggle, land reform has been completed or basically completed in areas with nearly 80 million people; the Resist America, Aid Korea work has been carried out; and nearly 150,000 grassroots cadres (cadres above the township level who have left production) have been trained in a series of democratic reform movements. This has strengthened the worker-peasant alliance and laid a solid foundation for the people's democratic dictatorship. It is now a transitional period from democratic reform to production as the main task. In recent years, because the Party and government at all levels have adhered to and implemented the Party Central Committee's policies and tasks, the face of the vast rural areas has undergone fundamental changes.

I. The Basic Situation of Rural Production in the Southwest at Present

First, agricultural production and the living standards of farmers have improved to a certain extent. According to the Party Central Committee's policy, after land reform, the Party's basic policy in rural areas is to give play to the enthusiasm of various economies, especially the enthusiasm for mutual assistance and cooperation on the basis of individual economy, in order to increase productivity, produce more grain and increase industrial raw materials, and improve the living standards of farmers. In the past few years, we have implemented this policy and have achieved remarkable results in this regard. In 1952, the region's grain production level had increased to an annual output of 49.4 billion catties of raw grain, which has recovered and exceeded the average level of 1931 to 1937 by more than 4 percent; exceeding 1949 by 24.2 percent. Farmers are exempt from paying rent to the landlord class, and have changed from the tragic state of earning very little after a year of hard work to an average income of 540 catties of grain per year, and their purchasing power has also increased significantly compared with before liberation. This shows that due to the new production relations, the enthusiasm of farmers for production has been enhanced, and the living standards of the vast number of farmers have begun to improve. However, it should be understood that they had little savings in the past, and coupled with backward production technology, although agricultural production has improved, the increase in sideline production is not significant, so they still have many difficulties in expanding production, and their living standards are still very low, and they cannot withstand the attacks of natural disasters. These situations need to be seriously supported and gradually and systematically changed in our future work.

Second, various types of mutual assistance and cooperation organizations in agricultural production have developed considerably in the past year or so. In general areas where land reform was completed earlier, about 30 percent of the peasant households participated, of which permanent mutual assistance groups accounted for about 10 percent; in areas where land reform was completed later, development has also begun. There are already 65 agricultural production cooperatives in the region. These mutual assistance and cooperation organizations, after the past winter and this spring, especially after studying the Central Committee's resolution on mutual assistance and cooperation and carrying out vigorous rectification, have effectively criticized and corrected certain erroneous tendencies, so that the quality of mutual assistance and cooperation organizations has been significantly improved, and its development has basically embarked on a healthy path. The development of mutual assistance and cooperation not only overcomes some specific difficulties encountered by farmers in production, effectively overcomes various natural disasters, thereby increasing the output and income of farmers participating in mutual assistance and cooperation; but also educates farmers through these vivid and specific contents, and improves their collectivist thinking. Especially after the emergence of some model mutual assistance groups, its educational significance for farmers is even greater. These have laid a good foundation for the future mutual assistance and cooperation movement. However, in the current work, there are still some problems, that is, the ideological emotions of some areas that violate the reality of the small-scale peasant economy, such as greed for more, greed for big, and quick results, have not been completely overcome, and some areas have become timid and dare not lead after correcting the blind and rash emotions. These also need to be further resolved in our future work.

Third, there are already 361 various farms of a socialist nature in the region, with a cultivated area of ​​125,080 mu, of which those that have been well-run have played an important demonstration role in agricultural production. However, most of the farms are not well-run, and there is extreme blindness in management. The main problems are lack of leadership and lack of clear direction. Since this year, party and government leading organs at all levels have attached importance to this, strengthened leadership and started to organize rectification work, and the past situation of unclear direction and blind operation has begun to change. This work has been included in the plan for this winter and next spring, and it is estimated that the situation will change after continued efforts.

II. From more than three years of leadership in agricultural production, according to the situation in the Southwest, several issues that need special attention are:

First, we must pay great attention to the regionality, seasonality, and seasonal differences between regions in agricultural production. The Southwest Region is a region with complex terrain and very uneven climate. There are high and cold mountainous areas as high as 3,000 meters with year-round snow, and there are hilly and plain areas with fertile land and relatively mild climate. The climates of these regions vary greatly. In the current situation where cultivation technology and equipment conditions are still relatively backward, it has a strong dominance over crops. The planting of any crop must adapt to the natural climate of each region and must not violate its development laws.

The main crop in the Southwest Region is rice, which accounts for about 50 percent of the total cultivated area, and some areas harvest two crops a year. This crop, from the preparation for sowing to the harvest period, has a very close continuity. Coupled with the staggered planting of spring wheat and other multiple crops, farmers are almost always busy throughout the year. This means that leading agricultural production must adapt to the seasons and not violate agricultural time, and pay attention to farmers' production time. Any violation, even a slight one, will bring irreparable losses to production and politically detach ourselves from the masses.

Second, we must always pay attention to leading the broad masses to fight against various natural disasters. This is one of the important keys to ensuring agricultural production. The vast rural areas of the Southwest Region not only have historical and periodic disasters such as drought, flood, and disease, but also have quite serious disasters such as animals and insects. These disasters attack the growth of crops and the safety of humans and animals throughout the year. In the past, many farmers often lost their livelihood because of this and fell into a state of hunger and cold. After liberation, party and government at all levels made great efforts in this regard, leading and supporting farmers in disaster-stricken areas to overcome and survive the disasters. The broad masses of farmers and we have also gained relatively rich experience in this regard. These experiences fully prove that any serious natural disaster is not irresistible. As long as the leadership attaches importance to it, goes deep into the masses, gives full play to the wisdom of the masses, and vigorously supports the masses, it is very likely to overcome the disaster. This year's disasters in various places, whether the drought during the spring and summer, or the storms and insect pests during the summer and autumn, were more serious in some places than in the past ten years. But finally, under the timely attention of party and government leading organs at all levels, leading the farmers and working together with the farmers with one heart and one mind, we overcame or basically overcame these disasters. We believe that as long as there are no more unexpected disasters in the future, we are still confident in completing this year's production increase task on a large scale. This shows that leading agricultural production while neglecting to fight against various natural disasters, or appearing powerless in the face of natural disasters, will commit serious errors and bring adverse consequences to production.

The biggest problem currently existing is that some areas do not have a long-term plan to fight against natural disasters. Their work lacks continuity and a spirit of carrying through to the end. They are often satisfied with temporary blitzkriegs that produce results, and even the leadership in individual areas still shows an attitude of indifference and indifference in the face of disasters. These ideological problems also need to be seriously resolved in our future work.

Third, we must pay great attention to the improvement of agricultural technology. The general cultivation technology in the Southwest Region is very backward. In some remote mountainous areas, primitive cultivation methods such as "slash-and-burn cultivation" and "relying on mountains for food" are still used to this day. These situations greatly limit the improvement of agricultural productivity. In the past three years, we have made great efforts in this regard and have indeed achieved certain results. Facts fully prove that as long as cultivation technology can be slightly improved on the original basis and can adapt to the laws of crop development and growth, there is no problem in improving the production level. However, experience also tells us that carrying out this work is by no means an easy task. On the one hand, we need to carry out active leadership work without slackening, and on the other hand, we must always pay attention to the degree of acceptance and economic conditions of the masses, and gradually improve it with the continuous improvement of the masses' awareness and economic conditions, as well as mutual assistance and cooperation. Any subjective and impetuous emotions will bring losses to the work. Currently, the most important thing should be to summarize the advanced experience already existing among the masses, use local materials, and promote them locally, combined with scientific and technological guidance, so that the experience of the masses and scientific and technological can be combined. This is the basic policy of our current technical guidance work and must be resolutely implemented. All localities are also advancing along this road.

Fourth, water conservancy construction is regarded as an important aspect of agricultural production work. As mentioned earlier, rice crops in the Southwest Region account for about half of the total cultivated area, but the area guaranteed to be irrigated by water only accounted for 5 percent before liberation, and most of it relied on rainfall. After liberation, we have led and assisted farmers to build and repair medium and small-sized canals and ponds and dams that can irrigate 14,736,226 mu of land, and repaired large-scale water conservancy projects such as Dujiangyan. We are now also carrying out small, medium and large-scale water conservancy projects that can irrigate more than 2 million mu of land. These measures have added many favorable conditions to agricultural production and are very popular among the broad masses of farmers. However, it is still quite far from the needs of crops, and it needs to be further resolved in future work, and we are working hard in this way. An important issue that needs to be resolved at present is that we must correct the tendency of some local cadres to be ambitious but unable to deliver, looking down on small-scale water conservancy projects that cost less and produce quick results, and disregarding the country's economic conditions and the actual needs of the masses. They often like to carry out long-term plans for a century, thinking that small-scale water conservancy is "not great". Obviously, this is subjective and not allowed in today's situation. We must take the construction of mass-based medium and small-scale farmland water conservancy for the actual needs of the masses as the basic policy at present, and some large-scale projects can only be carried out in a focused and step-by-step manner.

III. Further strengthen the Party's leadership over agricultural production and implement the Party's policies and tasks in rural areas

First, we must continue to implement the Party's production policy and mutual assistance and cooperation policy, further stabilize and improve the production enthusiasm of farmers and other classes, and actively and steadily develop the mutual assistance and cooperation movement. After the land reform, the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers has been unprecedentedly high. This emotion has brought a continuous forward momentum to production. Under the policy of allowing the existence of the rich peasant class and allowing its economic limited development, the production emotions are basically normal, and the landlords are also carrying out labor reform under the supervision of the broad masses of farmers. There is no doubt that we have achieved great results in these areas. However, it cannot be considered that there are no problems. Because some areas have not fully implemented the Party's policies on mutual assistance and cooperation, burdens, and agricultural production, or have deviated from them, it has caused some people to doubt the Party's policies, which has affected their enthusiasm for production. In the past year or so, we have made great efforts in this regard, and in general, we have basically reversed this emotion. However, in some areas, because the leadership still has not attached importance to solving this problem, or only pays attention to general publicity and explanation work, and has not combined it with solving many specific problems that actually exist, some people there still have insufficient normal production emotions, and they are still worried about the burden problem and the problem of private ownership being turned over to the public from time to time. This is a major event that affects production and also affects the normal development of mutual assistance and cooperation, and we need to work hard to solve it.

Second, we must effectively solve the problem of unified leadership in rural work, so that production can become the overriding center, overcome the "five excesses", and enable other work that should be coordinated to be closely combined around the center. Experience has proved that the basic link in solving this problem lies in enabling cadres to correctly understand the relationship between central work and departmental work. At present, there are two erroneous views among some cadres. One is that central work and departmental work are opposed to each other, and understanding departmental work as serving the central work is understood as weakening or stopping departmental work, so cadres from departmental work are drawn to specialize in central work, rather than serving the central work through departmental business work. One is that the Party and government are not separated, and all departmental work is contracted by the Party committee. Everything requires leading cadres to do it themselves, reducing the Party's leadership level, making the Party committee a bureaucratic agency, and failing to give full play to the enthusiasm of the departments. Both of these are incorrect. The Party's leadership lies in correctly determining the central work of each period, as well as proposing and arranging departmental tasks to do the central work well. The departments make specific plans, which are reviewed and approved by the Party committee before being organized and implemented. The Party committee then adds necessary inspection and supervision work. Only in this way can the Party committee grasp the center while also enabling the departmental work to be carried out with leadership and planning, and serve the central work. The local Party committees and county committees should pay special attention to this point.

Third, we must effectively solve the problem of detachment between leaders and producers. At present, many cadres in our region, especially district and township cadres, still do not understand production and lack correct working methods for leading production, so that some aspects in this year's production movement still cannot move forward on the normal path. This requires party and government leading organs at all levels above the county to continue to mobilize and lead all rural work cadres to "stabilize, drill in", learn the ability to lead production, change from outsiders to insiders, often go deep into the masses, go deep into the production process, discuss matters with the masses, learn from the masses, and explore and summarize the masses' experience to educate and guide the masses. In addition, leaders at all levels should also attach importance to establishing key points, setting examples, and adopting the method of taking apprentices to give specific help to district and township cadres. This can not only prevent the blind optimism of being satisfied with the status quo and not seeking further in-depth, but also help district and township cadres overcome the depressed emotions caused by not knowing how to work, and gradually establish a working style of close integration between the leadership and the masses.

Fourth, we must earnestly and enthusiastically help the masses solve various difficulties in production. This is not only the most realistic problem in the current production, but also the specific embodiment of our Party's policy of supporting poor and hired peasants and uniting with middle peasants. This problem is mainly solved by two aspects. On the one hand, the government strongly supports it, issuing agricultural loans and other loans and relief grain and money, and doing a good job in the supply and marketing of rural commodities. On the other hand, it relies on the strength of the masses themselves, through mutual assistance and cooperation and other forms of mutual assistance and mutual benefit among the masses, to overcome the difficulties encountered in production. This is still the main aspect at present.

Fifth, we must strengthen the leadership of production in mountainous areas. The population of mountainous areas in the Southwest Region is about 18 million, of which ethnic minorities account for 13 million, most of whom are in areas with barren land and poor people. Although we have given great support after liberation, the situation of backward cultivation and poverty is still serious. We are preparing to gradually solve this problem. To develop production in mountainous areas, according to the situation in our region, we should still focus on agriculture, especially grain production, followed by forestry, animal husbandry and other sideline production that can be developed according to local conditions, and strengthen transportation, systematically build highways, post roads, and strengthen medical and health work. Only in this way can the lives of the people in mountainous areas gradually be improved.

Sixth, regarding other economic work in rural areas, such as trade, supply and marketing, and primary markets, the main problem at present is that many Party committees have not seriously taken charge of these tasks, so that the combination of agricultural production and economic work is not good enough. We have begun to attach importance to overcoming this shortcoming and must strengthen leadership in this regard in the future.

In short, in more than three years, our achievements in rural work have been great, but there are still some problems. Coupled with the transformation of basic tasks, the tasks facing us are also very glorious and arduous, and we need to make persistent efforts to complete this historical political task.

    西南区农业生产中的几个问题
    中共中央西南局农村工作部副部长  李登瀛
    西南区广大农村，在党和政府的领导下，经过三年多的艰苦斗争，完成了或者基本上完成了近八千万人口地区的土地改革；进行了抗美援朝工作；在一系列民主改革运动中培养了近十五万左右基层骨干（乡以上脱离生产的干部）。从而加强了工农联盟，为人民民主专政打下了坚实的基础。现在已经是由民主改革转向以生产为主的过渡时期。几年来，由于各级党和政府坚持贯彻了党中央的方针任务，所以，广大农村的面貌已经从根本上起了变化。
    一、目前西南农村生产的基本状况
    第一、农业生产和农民的生活水平都有了一定程度的提高。根据党中央的方针，土地改革后，党在农村的基本政策是发挥各种经济的积极性，尤其是在个体经济基础上的互助合作的积极性，以提高生产力，多打粮食和增产工业原料，提高农民的生活水平。几年来，我们贯彻执行了这一方针，且在这方面已经取得了显著的成绩。全区一九五二年粮食生产水平已提高到年产四百九十四亿斤原粮，已恢复并超过一九三一年至一九三七年平均水平的百分之四强；超过了一九四九年百分之二十四点二。农民免除了对地主阶级的缴租，已由一年辛勤劳作，结果所得无几的悲惨状态一变而为每年能有五百四十斤粮食的平均收入，他们的购买力也比解放前有显著提高。这说明由于有了新的生产关系，提高了农民的生产积极性，从而广大农民的生活水平已经开始得到提高和改善。但是应该了解他们过去是没有什么积蓄的，加上生产技术的落后，农业生产虽有提高，但副业生产增加不多，所以他们在扩大生产上还存在着许多困难，他们的生活水平也还是很不高的，他们还经不起自然灾害的袭击。这些情况是需要我们在今后的工作中，认真扶植他们，逐步地、有计划地加以改变的。
    第二、农业生产的各种类型的互助合作组织，在一年多的时间里，已有了相当的发展。在土地改革完成较早的一般地区，参加的农户都在百分之三十左右，其中常年互助组约占百分之十左右；在土地改革完成较晚的地区，也开始有了发展。全区已经有了六十五个农业生产合作社。这些互助合作组织，经过去冬今春，特别是在学习了中央的互助合作决议，进行大力整理之后，有效地批判和纠正了某些错误倾向，从而使互助合作组织在质量上有了显著的提高，它的发展已基本上走向健康的途径。互助合作的发展，它不仅克服了农民在生产上所遇到的某些具体困难，有效地战胜了各种自然灾害，从而使参加互助合作的农民提高了产量，增加了收入；而且通过这些生动的、具体的内容，教育了农民，提高了他们的集体主义思想。特别是在出现了
    一些模范的互助组之后，它对农民的教育意义更大。这些都给今后的互助合作运动奠定了良好的基础。但是在现在的工作中，仍然存在着一些问题，即部分地区的违反小农经济现实状况的贪多、贪大、图快的思想情绪还没有完全克服，某些地区在纠正盲目冒进情绪后又产生了束手束脚不敢领导的消极情绪。这些也都是需要在今后的工作中继续加以解决的。
    第三、社会主义性质的各种农场，全区已经有三百六十一个，耕地面积一二五、○八○亩，其中办好了的，在农业生产上起了重要的示范作用。但多数农场办得是不很好的，经营管理上存在着极大的盲目性，主要的问题是缺乏领导和没有明确的方针。从今年起，各级党政领导机关已重视起来，加强领导和着手组织整理工作，过去的那种方针不明盲目经营的情况已开始得到改变。这一工作已列入今冬明春的计划里，估计经过继续努力之后，情况是会起变化的。
    二、从三年多农业生产的领导中，根据西南情况，体会到需要特别重视的几个问题
    第一、必须十分重视农业生产上的地域性、季节性和各个地区间季节的差别性。西南区是一个地势复杂气候很不调匀的地区，有高达三千公尺终年积雪的高寒山区，有土地肥沃气候比较温和的丘陵和平原地区。这些地区的气候有着极大差别，在今天耕作技术和设备条件还比较落后的情况下，它对农作物起着强烈的支配作用，任何农作物的种植都必须适应各地区的自然气候，不能违反它的发展规律。
    西南区的主要农作物是水稻，约占全部耕地面积百分之五十左右，有的地区年收两季。这种作物，从准备播种到收获期，其间的连续性是非常紧密的，加上小春及其他多种作物的参差种植，农民终年到头，几乎是没有什么空隙时间的。这是说，领导农业生产，要适应季节不违农时与重视农民生产时间，任何那怕是轻微的违背，都将会给生产带来无法弥补的损失，使自己从政治上脱离群众。
    第二、必须随时注意领导广大群众与各种自然灾害进行斗争，这是保证农业生产的重要关键之一。西南区的广大农村，不但有着历史性与周期性的干旱、水涝、疾病等灾害，而且还存在着相当严重的兽、虫等灾害。这些灾害，终年在袭击着农作物的成长和人畜的安全，在过去的年代里，许多农民常常因此而丧失了生活的依靠，陷于啼饥嚎寒的境地。解放后，各级党和政府在这方面作了极大的努力，领导和扶助受灾地区的农民，战胜和渡过了灾荒。广大农民和我们在这方面也取得了比较丰富的经验，这些经验完全证明，任何严重的自然灾害，都不是无法抗拒的，只要领导重视，深入群众，充分发挥群众的智慧并大力支援群众，战胜灾害是很有把握的。今年各地所发生的灾情，不论春夏期间的干旱，以及夏秋期间的风暴与病虫害等，有的地方严重程度是近十年来所没有的。但终于在各级党政领导机关的及时重视领导农民并与农民同心协力，群策群力下战胜了或者基本上战胜了这些灾害。我们相信，今后只要不再有什么意外的灾害，在大范围内完成今年增产任务还是有把握的。这说明，领导农业生产而忽视与各种自然灾害进行斗争，或者在自然灾害面前表现得无能为力，都将要犯严重的错误而给生产带来不良的后果。
    当前存在的最大问题，是某些地区与自然灾害进行斗争的长期打算不够，他们工作中缺乏经常性和贯彻到底的精神，往往以临时突击见效为满足，甚至个别地区的领导上仍然在灾情面前表现了熟视无睹、不痛不痒的态度。这些思想情绪问题也是需要我们在今后工作中继续地认真地加以解决的。
    第三、必须十分重视农业技术的改进工作。西南区一般的耕作技术是十分落后的。有些偏僻的高山地区，直至今天还仍然用着“刀耕火种”和“赶山吃饭”的原始耕作方式。这些情况，对农业生产力的提高是有极大限制的。三年多来，我们在这方面作了很大努力，也确实收到了一定的效果。事实完全证明：只要耕作技术能在原有基础上略有提高，能够适应农作物发育和成长的规律，生产水平的提高是没有问题的。可是经验也告诉我们：这一工作的进行，决不是一件轻而易举的事，一方面需要毫不怠惰地进行积极的领导工作，另方面又必须随时注意到群众的接受程度和经济条件，随着群众的觉悟和经济条件以及互助合作的不断提高而逐步地加以改进，任何主观急躁情绪，都会给工作带来损失的。当前最主要的应该是：以总结群众中已有的先进经验，就地取材，就地推广为主，结合科学技术指导，使群众经验和科学技术相结合。这是我们当前进行技术指导工作的基本方针，必须坚决贯彻执行的。各地也正在沿着这条道路前进着。
    第四、兴修水利，是作为农业生产工作的一个重要方面。如前所述，西南区水稻作物约占全部耕地面积的一半，可是保证有水灌溉的面积在解放以前仅占百分之五，大部是靠天吃饭的。解放后，我们已经领导和扶助农民兴修和整修了可灌一四、七三六、二二六亩田的中、小型水渠和塘堰，并整修了如都江堰等大型水利，现在还在进行着可灌二百多万亩田的小、中、大型水利工程。这些措施，给农业生产增加了许多有利条件，广大农民是十分欢迎的。但是，它和农作物应有的需要还有相当的距离，还需要在今后的工作中继续解决，我们也正是这样努力着。当前需要解决的一个重要问题是，必须纠正某些地区干部思想上所存在的那种眼高手低，看不起那些花钱少、收效快的小型水利以及不顾国家经济条件和群众实际需要的倾向，他们常常喜欢进行百年大计的深远计划，认为小型水利是
    “不伟大”的。显然，这是主观主义的，是今天情况所不能允许的。必须把兴修群众性的，为群众实际需要的中、小型的农田水利作为当前的基本方针，某些大型的工程，只能是重点地、有步骤地进行。
    三、进一步加强党对农业生产的领导，贯彻执行党在农村中的方针任务
    第一、必须继续贯彻党的生产政策与互助合作政策，进一步稳定与提高农民与其他阶层的生产积极性，积极稳步地发展互助合作运动。土地改革以后，广大农民的生产热情是空前高涨的。这种情绪，给生产带来了不断前进的因素。富农阶级在允许其存在并允许其经济有限制的发展的政策下，生产情绪基本上也是正常的，地主在广大农民的监督下也进行着劳动改造。无容置疑，我们在这些方面已经取得了巨大的成绩。但是不能认为是没有问题的，由于某些地区在执行党的互助合作、负担以及农业生产等政策上贯彻不够或者发生了偏差，曾引起了一些人对党的政策的怀疑，影响了他们的生产积极性。近一年多来，我们在这方面作了极大努力，一般地说也基本上扭转了这种情绪。可是在有些地区内，由于领导上仍然没有重视解决这一问题，或者只注意一般的宣传解释工作，而没有结合解决实际上存在着的许多具体问题，以致那里仍然有些人生产情绪不够正常，他们还不时在担心负担问题和私有归公的问题。这是影响生产，也是影响互助合作正常发展的大事，需要我们努力加以解决的。
    第二、必须有效地解决农村工作的统一领导问题，既能使生产成为压倒一切的中心，克服“五多”，又能使其他应该配合的工作，围绕中心，紧密地结合进行。经验证明：解决这一问题的基本环节在于使干部正确理解中心工作与部门工作的关系。目前在一部分干部中存在两种错误的观点，一种是中心工作与部门工作对立，把部门工作为中心工作服务理解为减弱或停止部门工作，因而把部门工作的干部抽来专搞中心工作，而不是通过部门业务工作为中心工作服务。一种是党政不分，把所有部门工作由党委包办下来，事事要求领导干部亲自动手，降低党的领导水平，使党委变成事务主义的机关，又不能充分发挥部门的积极性。这都是不对的。党的领导在于正确地确定每一时期的中心工作，以及提出和安排为作好中心工作的部门任务，由部门作出具体计划经党委审查批准后组织执行，党委再加必要的检查督促工作，只有这样才能使党委既能抓紧中心同时又使部门工作能有领导有计划地进行，并为中心工作服务。这一点，各地委、县委应特别重视。
    第三、必须有效地解决领导生产者与生产者脱节的问题。目前我区干部，尤其是区乡干部仍有不少不懂生产和缺乏正确领导生产的工作方法，致使今年生产运动中仍然有些方面不能在正常的路途上前进。这就需要县以上各级党政领导机关，继续动员和领导全体农村工作干部“稳下来，钻进去”，学会领导生产的本领，变外行为内行，经常地深入群众，深入生产过程，有事和群众商量，向群众学习，发掘和总结群众的经验来教育并指导群众。此外，各级领导还应重视建立重点，树立榜样并采取带徒弟的方式，给区乡干部以具体帮助，这样既能防止满足现状，不求继续深入的盲目乐观思想，又能帮助区乡干部克服因不会工作而产生的苦闷情绪，逐步树立领导和群众紧密相结合的工作作风。
    第四、必须切实地、满腔热忱地帮助群众解决生产中的各种困难。这不仅是当前生产中的最现实的问题，而且是我党扶助贫雇农和团结中农政策的具体体现。这一问题主要靠两方面解决。一方面是政府大力支持，发放农贷及其他贷款和救济粮款，做好农村商品的供销工作。一方面是依靠群众自己的力量，通过互助合作及群众中其他互助互济形式，克服生产中所遇到的困难。这在当前来说还是主要方面。
    第五、必须加强高山地区生产的领导。西南区高山地区的人口约一千八百万，其中少数民族占一千三百万，绝大部分属地瘠民贫地区。解放后虽经我们大力扶植，但耕作落后，生活贫困的情况仍然严重。这一问题，我们准备逐步解决。发展高山地区生产，根据我区情况仍应以农业为主，其中特别是粮食生产，其次是因地制宜地发展林业畜牧及其他可以发展的副业生产，并加强交通运输，有计划地兴修公路驿道和加强医药卫生等工作。只有这样才能使山区人民生活逐步得到改善。
    第六、关于农村其他经济工作，例如贸易、供销、初级市场等，目前主要的是很多党委没有把这些工作认真掌管起来，使农业生产和经济工作结合的不够好，这个缺点我们已开始重视克服，今后必须加强这方面的领导。
    总之，三年多，我们在农村工作方面的成绩是巨大的，但是也还存在着一些问题，加上基本任务的转变，因而摆在我们面前的任务也是十分光荣而艰巨的，需要我们再接再厉努力完成这一历史的政治的任务。
