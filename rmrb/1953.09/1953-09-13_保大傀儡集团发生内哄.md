Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 9th: French newspapers are discussing the escalating internal political crisis in Bảo Đại's Vietnam. The puppet government's Prime Minister, Nguyễn Văn Tâm, who recently went to Paris to negotiate with the Laniel government, suddenly returned to Saigon on the 8th because of threats in Saigon against his government and himself. According to the "Courrier d' Saigon," this threat came from the nationalist "Congress for Unity and Peace," which expressed dissatisfaction with Nguyễn Văn Tâm's blatant pro-French attitude. The newspaper also pointed out that Nguyễn Văn Tâm intends to dissolve this conference after returning to Saigon and replace it with another conference if the meeting continues to adopt an opposing stance to Bảo Đại and Nguyễn Văn Tâm. "Courrier d' Saigon" pointed out, "In this case, a unique civil war may occur in Saigon." According to previous newspaper reports, there is also considerable tension between Bảo Đại and Nguyễn Văn Tâm because Bảo Đại is under pressure from nationalist elements and is dissatisfied with his Prime Minister's overly blatant dependence on France. Some newspapers pointed out that they had achieved "reconciliation" in Cannes (where Bảo Đại currently resides). However, according to "Courrier d' Saigon," "This reconciliation is only superficial because Bảo Đại understands very well that if he confronts them, they will take the same approach to him as Gloui did to the Sultan of Morocco... Therefore, Bảo Đại is now striving to obtain the broad support of the nationalist 'Congress for Unity and Peace.' The nationalists demand the expulsion of Nguyễn Văn Tâm, the convening of a national consultation conference, and demand Vietnamese independence, free from the constraints of the French Federation. If Bảo Đại does not support the nationalists, they will break with him."

    保大傀儡集团发生内哄
   【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社巴黎九日讯：法国报纸谈到日益加剧的保大越南的内政危机。傀儡政府的总理阮文心不久以前到巴黎去和拉尼埃政府进行谈判，八日突然回到西贡，因为在西贡发生了对他的政府以及他个人不利的威胁。据“义勇军报”的消息，这一威胁是来自民族主义者的“争取联合与和平大会”，这一大会对阮文心的十分露骨的依附法国的态度表示不满。该报同时指出，阮文心企图在到西贡后解散这一会议，代之以另外的会议，如果会议继续与保大和阮文心采取对立的立场的话。“义勇军报”指出，“在这种情况下，可能在西贡发生独特的内战。”据前一时期报纸消息，在保大和阮文心之间也存在着相当紧张的关系，因为保大受到民族主义分子的压力，所以对他的总理的太露骨地依赖法国的态度表示不满。有些报纸指出，他们在戛纳（现在保大居住地）得到了“和解”。但是据“义勇军报”证明，“这一和解只是表面的，因为保大很明白，他要是与他们对抗的话，那他们就会采取格拉维对待摩洛哥素勒檀的办法，……所以保大现在竭力要取得民族主义者的‘争取联合与和平大会’的广泛支持。民族主义者要求驱逐阮文心，召开全国协商会议，并要求越南独立，不受法兰西联邦的约束。如果保大不支持民族主义者，那他们就要与他决裂。”
