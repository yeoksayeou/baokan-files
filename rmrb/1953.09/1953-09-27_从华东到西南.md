From East China to Southwest China
Yu Fang

Dear Comrade Gu Liqing of the 4th Squad, 1st Platoon of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and to all comrades of the platoon:

In three more days, we will be celebrating the fourth anniversary of the founding of our new China. In these short four years, our new motherland has made great achievements in all aspects of construction.

In July, due to work reasons, I had the opportunity to travel from Hangzhou on the coast of East China to Ya'an, a city in western Sichuan Province. People had told me about the hardships of long journeys, but I want to sing about everything I saw on the journey, to sing the vibrant song "How Vast Our Motherland Is!"

At the Minsheng Wharf in Shanghai, passengers with various luggage and packages were greeting and crowding each other. A car conspicuously parked in the square of the Minsheng Company, with a red flag on it that read "Support Chongqing Construction!" Many, many luggage were piled around the car, and many people were standing and talking and saying goodbye warmly.

Coincidentally, the five passengers sent by this car were my neighbors. They were an engineer and four technical workers, going to Chongqing to build a new gas plant. From their conversation, I learned that they were proud of their skilled technology and the task of building the new plant. They said, "The gas plant is very much needed for the country's construction, we must do everything possible to build it!"

That day, I boarded a ship and began my journey on the Yangtze River, the largest river in our motherland. The ship moved forward non-stop against the rapids of the river. Passengers stood by the ship's railing to admire the scenery on both sides of the Yangtze River, and talked about everything under the sun. In the chat, what impressed me most was the words of a People's Liberation Army soldier. He said, "I have been running on this Yangtze River since I was seventeen. In the past, every wharf I passed on the Yangtze River had warships docked, and the warships were all flying foreign flags. I hated and feared it when I saw it. Looking at it now, there are also many ships docked at every wharf, but every ship is flying the Five-Star Red Flag. Thinking about the past and looking at the present makes me so happy." When he said the last sentence, a deep and solemn expression appeared on his face.

The ship sailed past Nanjing, Wuhan, and kept heading southwest. When the passengers heard the announcer report, "Our ship has entered the Jingjiang River," everyone rushed to the ship's railing, waiting to see the huge water conservancy project of our motherland—the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project.

When I rushed to the railing on the second floor, the deck was already crowded. I had to stand on the threshold of the captain's room and stretch my neck to see. The ship was moving forward, and people were watching the green, vast southern bank of the Yangtze River without blinking. Suddenly, someone shouted, "Look, the floodgate is so long!"

People's eyes were focused on an extremely magnificent sight. From a distance, the huge floodgate of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project looked like a magnificent bridge, long and stretching all the way to the horizon. Two octagonal memorial pavilions were built at both ends of the floodgate.

The ship moved forward, but people were still leaning on the railing, watching and talking. A crew member told us about the scene when the project was underway, when the river and the bank were full of people and various equipment, and how their ship carried representatives of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to visit the construction site... People listened with great interest, wishing they could stop the ship and run ashore to see it.

After I finished my journey on the Yangtze River, I came to the newly built railway in our motherland—the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The story of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway can be told in a book, or it can be summed up in one sentence: it is the wish of the people of Sichuan. The Chinese Communist Party realized this wish!

Railways, trains, these were major events that the people of Sichuan had been looking forward to for many years. Our grandfather's generation hoped to take the train, our father's generation hoped to take the train, but how many of them died without waiting for it. When we were studying in rural primary schools in remote mountains and wild fields, we saw the smoking, big-headed, small-tailed monster in textbooks. The teacher said it was a train, but the teacher had never seen a train either.

When I grew up, I saw the symbols of railway lines in other provinces on the map, and I saw the "Monument to the Martyrs of the Railway Protection Movement of the Xinhai Autumn" in the People's Park in Chengdu. At that time, I thought, "Sichuan will never have a railway in its life!"...

Now, I am sitting at the Chongqing Station of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and all the past events about this railway are remembered.

The station is under construction, presenting a tense and enthusiastic scene everywhere. A row of workers' dormitories made of reed mats or bamboo mats faces the spacious waiting room and luggage room. In between is a square full of bricks, tiles, stones, and wood. Workers are carrying huge stones and lifting wood. Women are hammering stones as hard as men. People are running, shouting, and moving. Sweat drips from their foreheads to the ground.

Every platform is piled with goods. Many wooden boxes are marked with words such as "China Department Store Company," "×× Machine Manufacturing Factory," etc. I noticed that several huge wooden boxes contained universal grinders. These are about to be taken away by train and brought to the people along the railway.

Peasant passengers carrying shoulder poles and bags are talking. From their conversations, I learned that they came to the city to sell agricultural products, and now they are carrying cloth, soap, towels... ready to go back, satisfied to go back.

The train started. It "chugga-chugga" sounded, traveling through the wilderness and caves in the deep night. I suddenly remembered what a young railway worker told me when I was about to leave Hangzhou: "Don't think we won't see each other again in the future, we will see each other again. We are going to the Great Northwest, to the Great Southwest, and in the future, railways will be laid all over the country!" I also remembered a story a passenger told me: when the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was being built, hundreds of thousands of logs were cut down from the mountains of southern and western Sichuan, and flowed down the Minjiang River to Chongqing. So many logs, flowing through thousands of miles, not a single one was missing, not a single one was missing! At night, the peasants held torches and guarded the logs near the river near their villages, letting those logs flow safely to the next section... This simple story contains so much. I think the situation at that time may have been more complex, difficult, and enthusiastic.

I took a rickshaw from Chengdu Railway Station to the center of Chengdu. Although I spent my student days in this city, I feel like I don't know it very well. Those once dilapidated and bumpy roads outside the North Gate have become so flat, wide, and clean. Workers are still mixing large amounts of lime, gravel, and asphalt, and road rollers are rolling on the roads. What will they become?

"How's the general election going? Do you know?" I asked the rickshaw puller. "Of course, I know! Last night, our street nominated candidates, a total of four, one of whom is a female comrade. This is a right! The Communist Party brought it to us!" This is the "sleeping ancient city" that I once desperately wanted to leave, and now it has awakened from its sleep!

At the bus station from Chengdu to Xikang, there were piles of cloth and daily necessities, as well as a film projector and a reel of film, waiting to be transported.

It was raining heavily. Dozens of cars were parked in the square, waiting to depart (many of which were going to southern Sichuan). The second bus to Ya'an, Xikang was about to leave, and the passengers were rushing to jump into the bus. Suddenly, a PLA comrade left the bus and ran away in the rain. After a while, two Tibetan compatriots came with him. He let them get on the bus before getting on himself.

After everyone was seated on the bus, the two Tibetan comrades raised their thumbs and greeted and thanked the comrade repeatedly, and also offered cigarettes. The comrade also answered them in Tibetan. They looked at each other and laughed, like friends, like brothers.

It turned out that this PLA comrade knew their bus number at the waiting area. When the station staff called to board the bus, they didn't understand, so they were still standing at the waiting area. This comrade remembered and ran to call them.

This comrade is our respectable comrade. Twenty years ago, when he was only a teenager, he followed the Red Army through the grasslands and left his hometown of Xikang. Now, he has got a holiday to come back to visit his hometown. He loves his hometown and loves the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland. For this, he followed the army and fought almost all over the country. To this day, he still has an enemy's bullet in his body.

Leaving Chengdu, I arrived at Ya'an, the capital of Xikang. Ya'an is located on a plain, surrounded by mountains and rivers. The newly built cinema and cultural center stand in the center of the city. The bookstore is crowded with people. It is as lovely as other cities in the motherland! Coincidentally, the day I arrived here, the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement also reached this city. People were jubilant, singing, and at the same time vigilant. Comrades, who of the people growing up on the rich land of the motherland can not breathe with you!

Dear comrades, vigilantly defend the peace that has been won. This is the greatest entrustment and expectation of the people who are building the motherland day and night for you.

### 从华东到西南

专栏：

    从华东到西南
    余芳亲爱的志愿军某部一连四排顾立清同志并转全排同志们：
    再过三天，就是咱们的新中国成立的第四周年纪念了。在这短短的四年里，咱们新生的祖国在各方面的建设上已经取得了伟大的成绩。
    七月，因为工作的关系，我得到了机会从祖国东海之滨的杭州，旅行到祖国西部的一个城市——西康省的雅安。人们曾告诉过我长途旅行的艰苦，但我却要歌唱在旅途中所看到的一切，要歌唱“我们祖国多么辽阔广大”这个富有生命力的歌曲。
    在上海民生码头上，带着各种行李包裹的旅客们，在彼此招呼着，拥挤着。一辆汽车突出地停在民生公司的广场上，车上插着一面红旗，上写“支援重庆建设！”汽车周围堆着许多许多行李，站着很多人，在热烈地谈论和告别。
    很凑巧，这辆汽车送来的五位旅客，是我的邻居。他们是一个工程师和四个技术工人，为了建设一个新的炼气厂而到重庆去的。从谈话中，我知道他们因为自己的熟练的技术和建设新厂的任务而感到骄傲。他们说：“炼气厂对国家的建设很需要，我们一定要尽一切力量去搞！”
    当天，我乘上轮船，开始在祖国最大的河流——长江上面旅行了，轮船迎着江水的激流，不停地前进着，旅客们都站在船栏边观赏长江两岸的风景，并且天南地北无所不谈。在闲谈中，给我印象最深的是一个人民解放军战士的话，他说：“我十七岁就在这长江上跑，过去走过长江的每个码头上，都看见停着兵舰，兵舰上都是插的外国旗。看见了又恨又怕，再看现在，每个码头上也停着许多轮船，但每只船上都插上五星红旗了。想想过去，看看现在，真使我太高兴了。”当他说最后这句话时，他脸上浮现着深沉而严肃的神情。
    轮船驶过南京，武汉，一直向西南方向开进着。当旅客们听见广播员报告：“我们的船已进入荆江了”的时候，大家都急急地奔到船栏边，等着看一看那祖国巨大的水利工程建设——荆江分洪工程。
    当我赶到二楼上的船栏边时，甲板上已挤得没空隙了，我只得站到船长室的门槛上去伸着脖子看。船在前进着，人们不眨眼地看着绿色的、广阔的长江南岸。突然，有人叫了起来：“看呀，进洪闸好长啊！”
    人们的眼光都集中在一片极其壮观的景物上。远远看去，荆江分洪工程的巨大的进洪闸，好像一座规模雄伟的桥梁一样，长长地，一直向天边伸去。进洪闸的两端，修建着两个八角纪念亭。
    船前进着，但人们还倚在栏边了望着，谈论着，一个船员告诉我们当工程进行时，江上和岸上全被人和各种器材铺满了的情形，以及他们的船载着亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表们来参观工地的情形……。人们听得很有劲儿，恨不得停下船来，跑上岸去看看。
    当我结束了长江上的旅行之后，又来到了祖国新建的铁路——成渝铁路上，关于成渝铁路的故事可以用一本书来叙述它，也可以用一句话来说完它：它是四川人民的心愿。中国共产党实现了这个心愿！
    铁路，火车，这是四川人民多少年来就盼望的大事，我们祖父一代盼望坐火车，我们父亲一代盼望坐火车，但他们之中不知道有多少人，在没有盼到时就死去了。我们这一代呢，在穷山僻野的乡村小学读书时，从教科书上看见那冒烟的，头大尾小的怪物，老师说那是火车，但老师也没有见过火车。
    长大了。我在地图上看见外省的铁路线的符号，在成都人民公园里看见“辛亥秋保路死事纪念碑”。那时我心中想：“四川是一辈子不会有铁路了！”……
    现在，我坐在成渝铁路的重庆站上，所有关于这条铁路的往事都被记起来。
    车站正在修建，到处呈现着一片紧张而又热烈的景象。用芦席或竹席盖成的一排工人宿舍，正对着宽大的候车室和行李房。这中间隔着一个满是砖瓦、石块、木料的广场。工人们在搬运着巨大的石块，抬着木料。妇女们和男人一样地在用力敲打着石子。人们在奔走着，?喝着，活动着。汗水从额上一直滴到地上。
    每个月台上都堆满了货物。许多木箱上都写着“中国百货公司”、“××机器制造厂”等字样。我注意到，有几个巨大的木箱装的是万能磨床。这些都是即将被火车载走，带给沿铁路的人民的。
    带着扁担和口袋的农民旅客们在谈论着。谈话中，我知道他们是到城里来卖农产品，现在都带着布匹、肥皂、毛巾……准备回去了，满意地回去了。
    列车开动了。它“切查”“切查”地响着，在深夜的原野上和山洞中穿行。我忽然想起了临离开杭州时，一个青年铁路工人对我说的话：“不要以为我们以后不会再见了，会再见的。我们要到大西北去，到大西南去，将来全国各地都要铺上铁路！”我又记起一个旅客告诉我的故事：在修成渝铁路的时候，不知道多少万根木料，从川南、川西各县的山上砍下，从岷江顺流而下，一直流到重庆。那样多的木料，流经千多里，没有少一根，没有少一根！夜里，农民们打着火把，在自己村子附近的河边看守木料，让那些木料平安地流到下一段去……。就是这个简单的故事，它包含着多少东西呢。我想，当时的情况也许还要复杂，艰难，热烈得多呢。
    我坐着黄包车，从成都火车站到成都市中心。虽然我曾在这个城市里度过了我的学生时代，但我毕竟觉得不大认识它了。那些曾是破烂、坎坷的北门外的马路，变得那样平整、宽大、干净。工人们还在熬拌着大量的泥灰碎石和柏油，压路机在马路上滚动着，它们还将变成什么样呢？
    “普选怎样？你知道么？”我问黄包车工人。“当然知道！昨晚上我们那条街已把候选人提出来了，一共四个，一个是女同志。这是权利嘛！共产党给我们带来的！”这里就是我曾经苦苦要离开它的那个“昏睡的古城”，现在，它已经从昏睡中醒过来了！
    在由成都到西康的汽车车站上，堆着许多布匹和日用品，也放着一架电影放映机和一盘电影胶片，那是等待运走的。
    雨下得很大。广场上停着数十辆待开的车子
  （有许多是到川南去的）。到西康雅安去的第二次车快开车了，旅客们都急着跳进车子。忽然，一个解放军同志离开了车子，冒着雨跑开了。停一回，两个藏族同胞和他一起来了，他让他们上了车，自己才上车。
    大家在车上坐定之后，那两个藏族同志翘起大拇指，连连地向这个同志打招呼致谢，又敬香烟。这个同志也用藏语回答了他们。他们相视而大笑，好像朋友，兄弟一样。
    原来这个解放军同志曾在候车的地方知道了他们要乘的车次。而当车站工作人员喊上车时，他们听不懂，所以还站在候车的地方。这个同志想起了，才跑去把他们叫来。
    这个同志，是我们的可敬的同志。二十年前，他只有十几岁的时候，就跟着红军经过草地，离开了他的故乡西康。现在，他得到假期回来拜望他的故乡，他热爱自己的故乡，热爱祖国的各族人民。为了这，他跟着部队，几乎在全国各地都战斗过，至今，身上还留着一颗敌人的子弹呢。
    离开了成都，我又到了西康的省会雅安，雅安位在一个平坝上，环山傍水。新建的电影院和文化馆，矗立在市区的中心。书店里挤满了人。它和祖国其他城市一样地令人可爱！碰巧，我到这里的那一天，朝鲜停战协定签字的消息也传到这个城市，人们欢腾着，歌唱着，同时也警惕着。同志们，生长在祖国富饶土地上的人民，谁能不和你们一块呼吸呢！
    亲爱的同志们，警惕地保卫已赢得的和平吧，这是正在日以继夜建设着祖国的人民，对你们的最大的嘱托和期望。
