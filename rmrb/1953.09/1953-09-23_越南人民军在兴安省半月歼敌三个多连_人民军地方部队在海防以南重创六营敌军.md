Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 21st: On September 14th, the Vietnamese People's Army eliminated the enemy stronghold at Ban Temple, five kilometers from the capital of Hung Yen Province in North Vietnam, annihilating more than two enemy companies, including a motorized company. In the attack, the People's Army destroyed three 105mm and three 75mm enemy artillery pieces, three tanks, and twenty-nine trucks, jeeps, and amphibious vehicles; and captured hundreds of weapons.

A week earlier, the People's Army had annihilated an enemy company in Bi Su, Hung Yen Province. In addition, from July 27th to August 25th, the People's Army killed or wounded 280 enemy soldiers in Hung Yen Province, destroying more than 50 trucks, tanks, and armored vehicles, and five artillery pieces.

Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam: At the end of August, local forces of the Vietnamese People's Army defeated a raid by six enemy battalions in Tien Lang District, Kien An Province, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

Tien Lang District is a solid guerrilla base between Thai Binh and Haiphong. Due to the importance of this location, the French army has repeatedly attempted to eliminate the people's armed forces of Tien Lang and occupy the area in order to strengthen their defensive forces at the Kien An and Haiphong strongholds. In mid-July of this year, the enemy sent sixteen motorboats and two gunboats to attack Tien Lang, but they were repelled by the local People's Army forces and guerrillas, suffering heavy casualties. By the end of August, the French army had concentrated six battalions, mostly European and African mercenaries, and dispatched ten gunboats, thirty motorboats, thirty artillery pieces, and many amphibious vehicles and aircraft, attacking Tien Lang County in four directions.

The invading enemy forces were resisted by local People's Army forces and guerrillas everywhere. After suffering heavy losses, the enemy barely entered Tien Lang County. Subsequently, they gathered their remaining forces into small groups and carried out sweeps in many villages. Here, they were met with fierce counterattacks by the guerrillas. In order to cooperate with the People's Army in Tien Lang County, the guerrillas in Hung Yen and Hai Duong Provinces also stepped up their activities and took the initiative to attack the enemy. The strong counterattack of the local People's Army forces and guerrillas finally forced the French army to withdraw from Tien Lang County.

According to incomplete statistics, the People's Army killed or wounded four platoons and more than 170 enemy soldiers in this counter-raid battle, sank one motorboat fully loaded with enemy soldiers, destroyed seven amphibious vehicles, armored vehicles, etc., and captured a large number of weapons and ammunition.

Xinhua News Agency, September 21st: News from various battlefields shows that guerrilla warfare is constantly being waged in enemy-held areas, especially in the North Vietnam region.

In July and August, in addition to the small-scale battles waged by guerrillas and militiamen and the counter-raid battle waged in Tien Lang County, Kien An Province, the Vietnamese People's Army carried out more than 430 battles in the Red River left bank area, annihilating 2,500 enemy soldiers. They captured four artillery pieces, seventeen mortars and bazookas, 290 machine guns, 540 rifles, fifteen radio stations, nine tons of ammunition, and a large number of other military supplies. They destroyed five 105mm artillery pieces, more than 100 armored cars and motorcycles, eight train cars, and one ammunition depot.

On the right bank of the Red River and in the central region of North Vietnam, local People's Army forces and guerrillas also inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. In addition to annihilating 1,300 enemy soldiers in the counter-raid battle in the southern part of Nam Dinh Province in August, the local People's Army forces killed or wounded more than 200 enemy soldiers and destroyed 28 trucks in Ha Nam Province in the one-month period up to August 15th. They surrounded four enemy strongholds. On August 30th, local People's Army forces in Ha Dong Province repelled a raid by five enemy battalions in My Duc County, killing or wounding 200 enemy soldiers. In Quang Yen and Hai Ninh Provinces, the People's Army eliminated the enemy strongholds of Linh Khe and Duong Hoa, killing or wounding approximately 80 enemy soldiers. They sank one gunboat and two ferries in Xun Mei.

In Central Vietnam, the People's Army killed or wounded more than 100 enemy soldiers in a counter-raid battle in Nga Son County, Thanh Hoa Province, in early August.

The People's Army sank an enemy landing craft in My Tho Province, South Vietnam, and destroyed the important Di Qing Bridge.

    越南人民军在兴安省半月歼敌三个多连
    人民军地方部队在海防以南重创六营敌军
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十一日讯：九月十四日，越南人民军在离北越兴安省省会五公里处拔除班寺的敌军据点，歼灭敌军两个多连，其中有一个摩托化连。人民军在进攻中击毁敌军一零五口径及七五口径大炮各三门，坦克三辆，卡车、吉普车和水陆两用车二十九辆；缴获了几百件武器。
    在此以前的一个星期，人民军曾在兴安省的比苏地方歼灭敌军一个连。此外，从七月二十七日到八月二十五日，人民军在兴安省已杀伤敌军二百八十人，击毁卡车、坦克和装甲车五十多辆，大炮五门。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军地方部队八月底在建安省先浪县击败敌军六个营的扫荡，使敌人受到严重损失。
    先浪县是太平和海防间的一个坚固的游击根据地。由于这个地方地位重要，法军曾屡次企图消灭先浪的人民武装部队，占领这个地区，以便增强他们在建安和海防据点的防御力量。今年七月中旬，敌军曾出动了十六艘汽艇和两艘炮舰进攻先浪，但被人民军地方部队和游击队击退，遭受严重伤亡。到八月底，法军又集中了大部分是欧、非籍的雇佣军六个营，出动十艘炮舰、三十艘汽艇、三十门大炮以及许多水陆两用战车和飞机，分四路向先浪县进攻。
    进袭的敌军处处遭到人民军地方部队和游击队的阻击。敌军在受到严重损失后，勉强进入先浪县。随后，他们就纠集了残余部队分成小股，在许多村庄内进行扫荡。他们在这里受到游击队的猛烈反击。为了配合先浪县的人民军，兴安省和海阳省的游击队也加紧活动，向敌军主动出击。人民军地方部队和游击队的坚强反击，最后迫使法军退出先浪县。
    据不完全的统计，人民军在这次反扫荡战中一共杀伤敌军四个排又一百七十多人，击沉满载敌军的汽艇一艘，击毁水陆两用战车、装甲车等七辆，缴获大量武器和弹药。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社二十日讯：从各个战场来的消息可以看出：游击战一直在敌后地区尤其是在北越地区进行。
    在七、八月份，除了游击队和民兵所进行的小规模的战斗以及在建安省先浪县所进行的反扫荡战以外，越南人民军在红河左岸地区一共进行了四百三十多次战斗，歼灭敌军二千五百人。他们缴获大炮四门、迫击炮和火箭筒十七具、机枪二百九十挺、步枪五百四十支、电台十五部、弹药九吨以及大批其他的军事供应品。击毁一百零五公厘口径的大炮五门，装甲车和摩托车一百多辆，火车车箱八节，弹药库一座。
    在红河右岸和北越中部地区，人民军地方部队和游击队也使敌军受到严重损失。除了八月间在南定省南部的反扫荡战中歼敌军一千三百人以外，人民军地方部队在到八月十五日为止的一个月中间，在河南省又杀伤敌军二百余人，击毁卡车二十八辆。包围了敌军的四个据点。河东省人民军地方部队八月三十日在美德县击退了敌军五个营的扫荡，杀伤敌军二百人。在广安省和海宁省，人民军拔除敌军的据点灵溪和阳化，杀伤敌军约八十人。在旬梅击沉炮舰一艘、渡船两艘。
    在中越，人民军八月初在清化省鹅山县的一次反扫荡战中杀伤敌军一百多人。
    人民军在南越的美萩省击沉敌军登陆艇一艘，并破坏了重要的迪清桥。
