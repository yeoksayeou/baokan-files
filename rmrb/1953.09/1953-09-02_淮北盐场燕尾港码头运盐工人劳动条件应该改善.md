    Huaibei Salt Field Yantaigang Wharf Salt Porters’ Labor Conditions Should Be Improved
    Reader Zhu Xun Chi writes: The stackyard (where salt packages are piled) at Yantaigang Wharf in the Huaibei Salt Field is about fifty or sixty zhang (approximately 167-200 meters) away from Hengzhen (right next to where the ships are docked). The salt packages are moved from the stackyard to the ships entirely by manpower. The salt porters run back and forth on the wharf all day, and their daily mileage is generally seventy-five li (approximately 37.5 kilometers), and half of the journey involves carrying salt packages weighing more than two hundred jin (approximately 100 kilograms) on their shoulders. Such heavy physical labor seriously affects the workers' health. According to statistics for November and December of 1952, there were thirty work-related injuries among the salt porters, including cases of hemoptysis, waist sprains, and falls while carrying salt packages. Although the relevant leadership has sent people to inspect the situation many times, the problem has not yet been resolved.
    Originally, there was a light railway for transporting salt from the tuo land (open-air salt storage area) of the Huaibei Salt Field to the stackyard at Yantaigang Wharf. If the wharf were widened a bit and the light railway were laid to Hengzhen on the wharf, it would no longer be necessary to carry salt packages from the stackyard to Hengzhen by hand. The workers have made the above suggestion, but the Lianyungang Branch of the Shanghai Port Authority, which manages Yantaigang Wharf, said: "The wharf workers are not under our leadership, and we cannot be responsible for work-related injuries." Cadres of the Huaibei Beach Office of the China National Salt Industry Corporation said: "We are only responsible for transporting salt, and all equipment should be resolved by the port authority and the salt affairs bureau." Cadres of the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau said:
    "The wharf is managed by the port authority, and our light railway cannot be laid to the wharf, nor do we have the right to widen the wharf." As a result, the three agencies are "shirking responsibility" from each other, and no one cares, and work-related injuries continue to occur.
    I believe that although the construction of a light railway on the wharf involves several agencies, each agency must not shirk responsibility as a result. It is suggested that the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau, the Huaibei Beach Office of the China National Salt Industry Corporation, and the Lianyungang Branch of the Shanghai Port Authority should quickly work together to solve this problem.
    Editor's note: The problem of frequent work-related injuries when handling salt packages at Yantaigang Wharf in the Huaibei Salt Field should be jointly resolved by the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau, the Huaibei Beach Office of the China National Salt Industry Corporation, and the Lianyungang Branch of the Shanghai Port Authority. The above-mentioned units should consider the suggestion of laying light rail tracks on the wharf, taking into account the specific local conditions; if it cannot be implemented at present, they should explain the reasons to the workers and study other feasible solutions. It is wrong to adopt an attitude of evasion and indifference towards the workers' suggestions.

### 淮北盐场燕尾港码头运盐工人劳动条件应该改善

专栏：读者来信摘要

    淮北盐场燕尾港码头运盐工人劳动条件应该改善
    读者朱薰池来信：淮北盐场燕尾港码头的屯场（堆盐包的地方）距离横枕（紧靠轮船停泊处）约五、六十丈，盐包从屯场搬运到装轮船处完全要用人力。运盐工人整天在码头上往返奔跑，一天的行程一般达七十五里，而且有一半路程肩荷着二百余斤重的盐包。这样过重的体力劳动，严重影响了工人的健康。据一九五二年十一、十二两月统计，运盐工人扛盐包时发生吐血、扭腰、跌伤等工伤事故三十起。有关领导方面虽曾多次派员检查，但问题仍未解决。
    从淮北盐场的坨地（露天堆盐场）到燕尾港码头的屯场原有一段运盐的轻便铁道。如果把码头加宽一些，把轻便铁道铺到码头横枕上，从屯场到横枕运盐包时就不必再用人扛。工人们曾提出以上的建议，但是，管理燕尾港码头的上海区港务管理局连云港分局说：“码头工人不属我们领导，工伤事故我们不能负责。”中国盐业公司淮北海滩办事处的干部说：“我们只管运盐，一切设备都应由港务分局和盐务管理局解决。”淮北盐务管理局的干部说：
    “码头是港务分局管的，我们的轻便铁道不能铺到码头上去，也无权把码头加宽。”结果三个机关互相“扯皮”，谁也不管，工伤事故仍继续发生。
    我认为，在码头上修建轻便铁道虽然要牵涉到几个机关，但各机关决不能因此就互相推卸责任。建议淮北盐务管理局、中国盐业公司淮北海滩办事处和上海区港务管理局连云港分局三个单位迅速会同解决这个问题。
    编者按：淮北盐场燕尾港码头搬运盐包时经常发生工伤事故的问题，淮北盐务管理局、中国盐业公司淮北海滩办事处和上海区港务管理局连云港分局应该会同设法解决。运盐工人们提出的在码头上铺设轻便铁轨的建议，上述单位应根据当地具体条件加以考虑；如果目前尚不能实施，也应该向工人说明理由，并研究其它可行的解决办法。对工人的建议采取推诿不管的态度是错误的。
