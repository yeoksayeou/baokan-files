    Unprecedented Things Have Happened to Me
    Since I started working in the repair section of the steel rope factory in February 1952, I have created seven mechanized and automated devices: automatic coiling machine, automatic meter cutting machine, automatic parking device, automatic molding machine, wood wheel drill, eye bed, and small crane.
    Why did I only enter the factory in 1952, and why was I able to create seven mechanized and automated devices in just over a year?
    I worked as a laborer for more than 20 years in the old society. Being fired by the Japanese doesn't count, and the enemy arrested and tortured me many times. Before "August 15th" (end of WWII), I was imprisoned for another year. I was overjoyed after the liberation of Northeast China. I thought, "This time, I've finally stopped being a slave of a fallen nation." Who knew that the Kuomintang reactionaries would come, and the common people would be even more unlucky? They looted like bandits. Everything in my house that could be worn or used was looted. I thought my life was over. I finally waited for liberation, but I was still being bullied.
    After the liberation of Northeast China, the factories reopened, and the workers returned to work. I thought, "Liberation and restoration are the same; I might as well just stay home and farm."
    Having been accustomed to using pliers in the factory, using a hoe to work in the fields was really like putting a duck on a shelf. What to do? At this time, skilled craftsmen were all going to the factories, so I took this opportunity to repair farm tools and earn a bowl of rice. However, I ran out of money halfway through. I was worried about what to do when, by chance, the People's Government found out and the district head personally came to my house to see me, encouraged me, and helped me solve my difficulties. I rushed to make two farm tools - a light shovel and a double-row seeder - and was praised by the county head. This really confused me. In the past, it was difficult for a worker to see the district head, but why did the district head personally come to see me now? Could it be that what many workers said, "Go to the factory, the factory is our own, the Communist Party and the People's Government are serving the people!" maybe it's true? Just then, my brother and my cousin came to visit me and talked about the factory. They told me, "Today's factory is very different from the past. The factory implements democratic management, and you can freely express your opinions to the leaders." They advised me to return to the factory. One was my brother, and the other was my cousin; they would never lie to me. At the time, I thought: Let's go and see what's going on.
    In February 1952, I entered the steel rope factory. After entering the factory and observing carefully, everything had changed. Even the factory director, with such a high position, would discuss matters with everyone. In the past, the workers wore rags and sighed all day long; now, everyone was clean, talking and laughing. Especially those young people, they worked harder than young tigers. This time, my heart was truly bright. Thinking about the past and looking at the present, I felt a pang of sadness. I, who hadn't cried for many years, started to shed tears for some reason. I thought, "Unprecedented things have happened to me, how wonderful!"

    Determined to Research and Successfully Created
    One day, the trade union group leader, Chen Yutang, mentioned something to me. He said, "Master Li! Look at the coiling machine in our rope making workshop, it's terrible. People pull the steel wire and wind it on the shaft. When the machine turns, it makes the worker's arm ache terribly. Can you modify it?" I thought, this is an opportunity to modify it and show everyone my old Li's craftsmanship! That evening, I went to the workshop with Lao Chen and saw how tired the workers were, and I felt very uncomfortable. Usually, when we work, it's either the hands work and the feet don't, or the feet move and the hands don't. But this coiling work requires both hands and feet to be busy. When the worker coils the wire, both hands hold the wire, one leg leans against the brake, and the other foot steps on the wire frame brake. When the machine turns, it shakes back and forth, and the person jumps up and down with it, jumping very high. Seeing this, I felt like I was on fire. I thought: The factory is our workers' own. The workers are the masters of the country, so we must make the machines obey us! From then on, I was determined to research it.
    At first, I specifically thought about how to prevent it from "making" the arm ache, but I couldn't figure it out for several days. By chance, one day I was folding clothes at home and saw the seams of the clothes. Suddenly, I found a way out: the sewing machine in the tailor shop has a cam wheel with a needle, and the needle eye is threaded with thread, so it can stitch clothes back and forth and the stitches are even. If I install this thing on the coiling machine, wouldn't it work? The more I thought about it, the more I thought it was right, and the happier I became. I didn't even bother to eat dinner and quickly started drawing. I planned to install a screw wheel under the shaft lever of the coiling machine to drive the cam wheel, and then install a long iron plate with an eye to guide the steel wire through the eye of the iron plate. When the cam wheel turns, the steel wire will be coiled back and forth. I spent five or six evenings drawing and modifying the drawing before I finished it. I showed the drawing to Chen Yutang. Lao Chen was very happy when he saw the drawing and told me to ask everyone for help if I had any difficulties. Before he finished speaking, Lao Chen took the drawing and left, saying he was going to discuss it with the leaders. When everyone knew about it, the leaders approved the use of materials and went to the warehouse to collect them. The lathe workers Lao Qian and Lao Cui also told me that if the lathes were too busy, they would help me make them on Sundays. With everyone's enthusiasm, I felt even more energetic. But then I thought: If I do this, it will be a big deal. If I don't do it well, I will fall on my face! The more I thought about it, the more difficult it became. In order to find a trick, I lied to the trade union group leader, pretending to visit relatives in Shenyang. When I arrived in Shenyang, I rushed to the shaft factory. At first, I looked at three or four small private shaft workshops, but they were all winding twill lines, which were not useful. Finally, I ran to a factory that winds plain lines. When I entered the room, I saw that the machine used an electric roller with a folding shaft. The shaft underneath was buckled in reverse, and the wire had to be sent back by hand, so people still had to work. Without saying a word, I came out. It was a wasted trip. There was no way, I had to make it according to the drawing first.
    As soon as I said I would do it, the workers worked hard and made all the parts. When it came to the test, the factory director, the party branch secretary, the trade union chairman, and the workshop cadres all came. When I saw that this matter was so grand, I carefully turned on the power. When the machine turned, it really did me proud. The steel wire, driven by the cam wheel, looked like a snake, coiling slowly and steadily onto the coiling machine. In a little while, it coiled up a shaft. After it was finished, everyone clapped and applauded. Some said, "Great! The machine is working by itself!" Some workers touched the steel wire and said, "It's coiled more evenly than if it were done by hand, like a mirror!" The trade union chairman grabbed my hand tightly and said, "Old Li! Your creation is a success! Great, keep up the good work!"

    If you don't think about anything, nothing will happen; if you think about things, there will be many things to do.
    The machine was converted to automatic, but the old wire frame was not good either. The wire frame was made of wood, with big eyes, and it jumped around when the wire was being coiled. If you didn't step on it, the coiled wire would not be even. Besides, even if the coiling machine was automatic, the wire frame still had to be stepped on, so it didn't save labor at all! Thinking of this, I pondered making a multi-head screw, installing a shaft inside, and installing copper tiles on the shaft to modify the wire frame. When I tried it, the wire frame moved as the coiling machine moved, and it didn't shake at all. With the wire on it, people could sit on a small stool and watch it coil the wire by itself. At this point, the coiling machine was truly automatic.
    After a few days, I was still worried, so I took some time to go to the machine again. Luckily, as soon as I entered the door, the workers shouted, "Master Li, come quickly! Look! The good machine is broken again; when the wire gets tangled, it breaks before anyone can get to it, what should we do?" I smiled when I heard this and said, "If you don't want the wire to break, unless the machine grows a heart and stops by itself!" At the time, it was a joke. Afterwards, I thought: No, I must find a way, otherwise if the wire keeps breaking, the rope will not be long enough, and how much loss will it cause to the country! From then on, I had another thing on my mind and worried about it all day long. One evening, I was riding my bicycle home, thinking about it while riding. I was so engrossed in my thoughts that I accidentally rode my bicycle into a ditch. With a thud, both the person and the bicycle fell. It didn't matter that I fell, I understood. Suddenly, I thought of the brake on the bicycle, and wondered if I could install a brake on the machine? When my mind opened up, I was really happy. I didn't even care about the pain, I rode my bicycle home and started drawing. It's true, when your mind is clear, there are many ways. While drawing, I thought of another thing: I used to see clutches in the factory, and installing one of these would be better than using a brake. After thinking it over, I modified the drawing and drew a drawing of a clutch. This thing is quite simple, only two iron plates, three pieces of leather, and an outer cover. It is adjusted with a wire buckle when in use. For example, if the wire has a force of 15 kilograms, when it reaches 13 kilograms, the wire wheel will stop by itself. In this way, as soon as the wire gets tangled, the coiling machine will stop working. Who would have thought that something that I originally thought was impossible to solve could be done. Afterwards, I joked with everyone: It doesn't matter if the coiling machine doesn't grow a heart, we can grow a heart for it! Because it can make the machine stop, everyone calls it "automatic parking device."

    Really, if you don't think about anything, nothing will happen; if you think about things, there will be many things to do. One day, I happily ran to see the machine again. When I turned around, I saw the workers using the re-coiling machine to re-coil short wires. After asking, I learned that the short wires that came down were useless. I thought, how much waste would it be if the machine made so many short wires! When I looked again, the workers were sitting there watching the machine quite leisurely, sitting and doing their work. But in the past, one person watched one machine, and now it's still one person watching one machine, and it doesn't save labor. I thought: Don't the leading cadres often say that mechanization is for improving labor conditions and increasing productivity? Good! I'll think along this line and try to get one person to watch several machines and make the wire coiled by the machine just enough to make rope, without leaving any short wires.
    At first, I planned to install a meter on the coiling machine, but then I thought, it wouldn't work to install a meter, because people would still have to watch the meter. I pondered making such a machine: first install a frame between the steel wire frame and the shaft wheel, install a screw wheel inside, and put a 20-tooth gear wheel on the wheel shaft. Install a steel knife, and the steel wire passes under this frame. When the screw wheel turns one circle, it will coil just enough, and the steel knife will immediately cut the wire.

    When the machine was made and tested, there was still a little wire left after making the rope. After a practical investigation, the size was modified again. It only takes 1.13 meters of wire to make one meter of rope. In order to make the machine and the size wheel stop at the same time when cutting the wire, a brake was installed. Everyone calls it the "automatic meter cutting machine." The automatic meter cutting machine works well with the coiling machine. Coiling, stopping, and cutting do not require people. This time, it's not difficult for one worker to take care of four or five machines.

    "If you don't add any goods, what are you going to sell!"
    After the automatic meter cutting machine was finished, the workers were very happy. The two apprentices who worked with me jumped for joy. Some said, "Old Li is not living in vain, this craftsman really has some skills." When everyone praised me so much, I didn't know how happy I was. My heart was really like opening a window, both cool and happy! Because I was so happy, it caused trouble! The workers who unloaded the wire and pushed the carts all came to the door. One said, "Master Li! Please think of a way for us! We hug a hundred kilograms of wire to our chests, and it's so hot!" The other said, "Master Li! It would be great if our carts were automatic! It's so tiring now. There are no ball bearings in the carts, and it's hard to breathe when pushing them!" Oh! When I heard this, I realized it was terrible. If these things were not modified well, it would be embarrassing if I got slapped in the face! Besides, I've already sold all my goods (referring to technical experience), if I don't add any goods, what am I going to sell! Alas! It's my fault for not knowing what's good for me. Why am I doing this at such an old age?! Thinking of this, I went to the factory director and asked to transfer to another factory.
    As soon as the factory director met me, he asked if I had any difficulties. He said, "If you have technical difficulties, engineers and technicians can tell you and help you; if you want to read books, our factory will buy them!" Because I lived far from the factory, the trade union specially found me a room for me to live in so that I could study conveniently. The trade union chairman also asked a carpenter to make a drawing board for me.
    For my sake, the party branch secretary talked to me for four or five days in a row before I understood the right way. I don't remember what he said, but I remember that he told me "Everything must be for the country, not for yourself"; he seemed to see into my heart, and his words were clear and comforting. Later, after listening to several party classes, I became even more clear in my heart; I thought, isn't the leadership helping me so much for the sake of improving the factory? It's not right for me to be afraid of this and that and only care about myself. After thinking it over, I felt warm and uncomfortable, so I went to the leaders to review myself and submitted an application to join the party. I expressed to the party: "I am determined to learn from the Communist Party's spirit of not being afraid of hardship for the country and the people, and to unite with comrades to improve the factory!"

    Always Follow the Path of the Party
    From then on, I regarded everything in the factory that needed to be modified as my own business. Whenever I had time, I would go to various places to see, and if I didn't understand something, I would ask others. One day, I heard that a 200-horsepower electric roller in our factory had broken down, so I quickly ran to see it. I saw the worker Liu Guangyan standing sadly next to the broken electric roller. I casually said, "This thing still needs someone to watch it, and if it gets hot inside, you won't know. It's a big loss if it breaks!" Lao Liu said, "This is not easy to fix. Even tigers doze off, how can people keep an eye on it!" "What if the electric roller shouts at you when it gets hot?" My words made Lao Liu laugh. He said, "Can a motor shout? I've never heard of that. Why don't you create one to see!" At the time, we were joking. Afterwards, I thought: "How many factories are there in China, and how many motors are there? How much loss would it be if they all broke down!" From then on, I paid attention to it. I didn't know much about electricity myself, so I followed the party's method of relying on everyone for everything and asked around. First, I asked the electrician Lao Liu to roughly explain the principle of the electric roller. Then, according to the principle of mercury rising in a thermometer, I welded an iron box, filled it with mercury, and used the force of the mercury rising to push a spring, and the spring would then push the circuit breaker switch, so the motor could stop by itself. After I finished this, the first time I tested it with a hot iron plate, the iron plate somehow bulged up, the mercury didn't move at all, and the welding of the iron plate also opened. When I looked the next day, it was really strange! It broke down again, but it wasn't broken, and the mercury was all over the floor. What's going on? Thinking of the party's words to ask others for advice if something happens, I went to the engineer. Thanks to the engineer's help, I understood the principle. I came back and turned an iron pipe, filled it with mercury, and tested it with two light bulbs instead of a switch, and it really worked. But it worked when the light bulbs were close, and it didn't work when they were far away. I went to the engineer for the second time, and with the engineer's help, I calculated the mercury coefficient and made the motor high-heat stop device. When this thing was installed on the electric roller, the electric roller would not break down even without someone watching it. When it reached 50 degrees, the mercury column would push a bell switch, and the bell would ring loudly. If people couldn't hear it, it didn't matter; when the mercury column rose to 60 degrees, it would push the circuit breaker switch and immediately stop the electric roller. The workers thought this thing was very novel and shouted, "How strange! The motor can call people."
    Later, I successively successfully researched the small crane and the automatic molding machine. These two creations, like the research on the motor high-heat stop device, were successful with the help of engineers and workers. When making the small crane and the automatic molding machine, I thought: No wonder the superiors always say "combine labor and technology, give play to collective strength", the leading comrades really see far; if something is difficult, everyone puts their heads together, and it really works, and it can be solved quite easily. After these successes, I calculated that the first automatic coiling machine, I did it myself, taking a total of half a year. What about the several collectively created ones later? Adding them together didn't take two or three months. I thought from now on, I am determined to always follow the path of the party. At this point, I also understood that these creations are not my personal glory, it is the glory of the party, it is the glory of our working class. In order to maintain this glory, I will never be arrogant and complacent. I will create the triangular steel rope and the automatic platform crane that I am currently researching as soon as possible to improve production.

    工人当家作主了，要叫机器也听使唤
    ——鞍钢钢绳厂工人栗根源创造机械化、自动化设备的经过
    栗根源讲
    鞍山市总工会整理
    从来没有的事还让我赶上了
    我从一九五二年二月进钢绳厂修理工段做活以来，创造了七件机械化、自动化设备：自动卷线机、自动米数切断机、自动停车器、自动打模机、钻木轮、眼床子和小吊车。
    我为啥在一九五二年才进厂子，又为啥在一年多里能创造七件机械化、自动化设备呢？
    我在旧社会做了二十多年的工，被鬼子开除过不算数，敌人还三番五次的把我抓去拷打，“八一五”前又蹲了一年监狱。东北光复以后，可把我乐坏了，我想，这回亡国奴可当到头了。那知国民党反动派来啦，老百姓就更倒霉了，他们像土匪一样地抢东西。我家有点能穿能用的东西，也都给抢光了。我寻思这辈子算完了，好容易盼光复了，还照样受窝囊气。
    赶东北解放以后，工厂都开了工，工人也都回厂子做活去了。我寻思“光复、解放还不都是一样，就在家种点地得了”。
    在厂子拿惯钳把了，要拿锄头下地干活，真是打鸭子上架。怎办呢？这个时候好手艺人都上工厂了，我就趁这机会整整农具，换碗饭吃。可是干到半路途中没钱了。正愁着没法，可巧人民政府知道信了，区长亲自到家里来看我，鼓励我，还帮助我解决了困难。我赶制了两件农具——轻便铲?机和双垅播种机，又得到县长的表扬。这下子真把我弄糊涂了。过去一个工人想见见区长是很难的，这时候的区长怎么还亲自跑来看我呢？难道好多工人所说的话：“上工厂吧，工厂是咱们自己的了，共产党和人民政府都是给人民办事的！”也许是真事？正赶这时候我兄弟和我表弟上我家串门来了，也跟我扯起工厂的事，他们告诉我：“今天的工厂与过去大不相同了，工厂都实行民主管理，对领导有意见还随便提。”劝我回厂子。一个是自个兄弟，一个是表弟，他们绝不会骗我。当时我想：去就去，看看到底怎回事。
    一九五二年二月我进了钢绳厂。进厂子后留心一看，啥都变了。就连厂长那么大的身分，有事也都和大伙核计。过去工人们穿的破破烂烂，整天咳声叹气；现在一个个都干干净净，有说有笑。特别是那些青年人，干起活来赛过小老虎。这回我心里可真亮堂透了。想想过去看看现在，一阵子好心酸，我这多年不哭的人，说不上怎的淌起眼泪来了。我想，从来没有的事还让我赶上了，多好啊！
    下决心研究，创造成功了
    有一天，工会组长陈玉堂跟我扯起一件事来，他说：“栗师傅！你看咱制绳车间的卷线机太不是玩艺儿，人拽着钢线往轴上缠，机器一转，把工人的胳膊‘蹲搭’得生疼，你能不能把它改改？”我一想，这可是个机会，把它改了给大家看看我老栗的手艺！当天下晚和老陈到车间里看到工人那个劳累法，我很难受。咱一般做活，是手干脚不干，脚动手不动，而这个卷线活是手脚一齐忙。工人缠线的时候，两只手搂着线，一条腿靠着闸，另一只脚还是踩线架闸；机器一转，来回乱幌，人也跟着乱蹦跶，一颠多高。看到这些，心里像窜火似的。我想：工厂是咱工人自己的了，工人当家作主了，那就得叫机器也听使唤！打这我就下决心研究它。
    开头我就专门想怎么不叫它“蹲搭”胳膊的道儿，想了好几天也没想好。偏赶上有一天在家叠衣裳，一眼看见衣裳缝，冷丁的（“忽然”的意思）由这里找出道来了：裁缝铺的缝纫机上有个桃形轮，带着针，针眼穿上线，就能来回左右的扎衣裳，扎的线脚还一样匀。要是在卷线机上安上这个玩艺儿，不也行吗？越想越对路，越高兴，晚饭也顾不的吃了，就赶紧画图。我打算在卷线机的轴杠下安个螺丝轮，用它带着桃形轮转，再安个带眼的长铁板，把钢丝引在铁板眼里，桃形轮一转，钢线就来回缠了。连画带改，整整忙了五、六个下晚，才把图画好。我把图给陈玉堂看了，老陈一看图挺乐，还告诉我有啥困难找大伙帮助我。话还没说完，老陈拿着图就走，说找领导同志商量去。这么一哄大伙都知道信儿了，领导上批准用啥材料上仓库去领；车工老钱和老崔也跟我说，车床子平时忙不过来就在星期天帮我做。叫大伙的热劲一闹哄，我心里更加了劲。可是反过来一想，这么一弄可就大发了，做不好就要栽个大跟头啊！越想心里越犯难，为了找个窍门，我向工会组长撒个谎，装着看亲戚去了一趟沈阳。到沈阳我就急忙往轴线工厂跑。起头看了三、四家私人轴线小作坊，都是卷斜纹线的，用不上。最后跑到一家缠平纹线的工厂，到屋里一看，原来那台机器是用个电滚带个折线轴，底下的轴是反正扣的，线过去再用手送回来，还得用人干活。一句话没说我就出来了。白去一趟。没法子，只好按图纸先做吧。
    说做就做，工人们紧一紧手就把零件都做全了。试验的时候，厂长、党总支书记、工会主席和车间干部都来了。我一看这事可真隆重，就小心在意地把电门开开了。机器一转还真做脸，钢线叫桃形轮带的就像一条蛇似的，不紧不慢地往卷线机上缠，一会就缠完了一轴。缠完了，大伙都乐的直拍巴掌，有的说：“真好！机器自个儿干活啦！”有的工人用手摸摸钢线说：“缠的比手摆的都匀，像镜面似的！”工会主席紧紧抓住我的手说：“老栗！你的创造成功啦！好极了，继续努力吧！”
    不想啥事没有，要想事儿就多了。
    机器改成自动的了，可是线架子还是旧的也不行。线架子是木头的，挺大眼，一缠起线乱蹦，要不用脚踩住它，卷出来的线就不匀。再说，就是卷线机自动了，线架子还得用脚踩，闹了归齐也不省人力啊！想到这，我就琢磨着弄个多头螺丝，在里边安个轴，轴上安上铜瓦，把线架子改了。一试，卷线机怎走，它怎走，一点也不幌了。把线上上，人在小凳子上一坐，看着它就自个缠线了。到这时候，卷线机才真叫自动的啦。
    过了几天我还不放心，抽空又看机器去了。可好，刚一进门，工人们就嚷嚷：“栗师傅快来吧，你看！挺好个机器又出毛病了；赶上线一乱，不等人到旁边就断线，怎办？”我一听就笑了，说：要叫线不断，除非机器上长个心，它自个想站就站下了！当时是说笑话。过后一想：不行，一定要想办法，要不竟出断线，打绳就不够尺寸，该给国家造成多大损失啊！打这，心里又添上一桩事，整天都惦记它。有一天下晚骑车往家走，一边走一边想，想的正入神，不小心把车骑到沟里去了。噗咚一下子，连人带车摔个实惠的。一摔不要紧，倒摔明白了，冷丁的想起车子上的踩闸来了，寻思着把机器上也安个闸就行了？心里一开窍真高兴，也顾不得疼了，骑上车就往家跑，到家就画图。真是的，心里要一亮堂，道儿就多了，画着画着又想起一个事儿：过去在厂子常看见离合器，安上这个比用闸还强。核计好了，就把图改了，彷照离合器画了一张图。这个玩艺儿说起来也挺简单，只用两块铁板、三块皮子，再加上一个外套。使唤时候用丝扣调整。比方线有十五公斤力量，到十三公斤的时候，就叫线轮自个儿站下。这样一来，线刚一乱，卷线机就不干活了。谁想到，原来寻思没法办的事，也弄成了。过后我和大伙开玩笑说：卷线机不长心不要紧，咱的心给它长上就行啦！因为它能叫机器站下，大伙就管它叫“自动停车器”。
    真是，要不想啥事没有，要想事儿就多了。有一天我又高高兴兴地跑到那看机器去啦，一回头看见工人们正用倒线机倒短线呢，一打听，才知道下来的短线没用场了。我想，叫机器下来这老多短线，该有多大浪费呀！又一看，工人坐在那看机器倒挺安闲，坐着就把活干了；可是过去一个人看一台，现在还是一个人看一台，也没节省人工。我想：领导干部不是常说机械化就为的是改善劳动条件、提高生产率吗？好！就顺着这个道儿琢磨，想法叫一个人能多看几台机器，叫机器缠出的线正够打绳，别剩短线。
    起头，打算在卷线机上安个表，可是又一想，安表也不行，表还得用人看着。我琢磨这么一个机器：先在钢线架子和轴轮中间安个架子，里头安个螺丝轮，轮轴上放的是二十个牙的牙轮，安上钢刀，钢线从这个架子下边过。螺丝轮转一圈，正好缠够数，钢刀马上就把线切断。
    机器做上一试，打出的绳多少还剩点线，又按实际一考查，把尺寸又改了一次。打一米绳，只用一米一百三十就够。为了叫机器和尺寸轮赶线切断的时候一块站下，又安了个闸。大伙就管它叫“自动米数切断机”。自动米数切断机跟卷线机一配合就好了，卷线、停车、切断都不用人啦。这回一个工人就是照看四、五台机器也不费难了。
    “添不进货来，还卖啥呀！”
    自动米数切断机弄完了，工人们可高兴啦，跟我干活的两个徒工乐的直蹦，有的说：“老栗头真不白活，人家这手艺人真叫有两下子。”叫大伙这么一捧，我也说不上怎么高兴了，心里真像开扇窗户似的，又风凉又痛快！这么一痛快不要紧，可惹出事来啦！卸线的、推车的工人们都找上门来啦，这个说：“栗师傅！你也给咱们想想办法吧！咱们把一百来公斤的线往心脯子上一抱，烫的火剌剌的！”那个说：“栗师傅！咱们推车的要自动该多好！现在可累了，车上连滚珠都没有，推起车来喘气都费劲儿！”哎呀！我一听可了不得啦，这些要是改不好，再打了脸才叫丢人呢！再说，我就那点货（指技术经验）都卖出去了，添不进来货，还卖啥呀！唉！就怪我当初不知道好歹，这么大岁数扯这个干什么？！想到这我就找厂长去啦，要求转厂子。
    厂长一见面就问我是不是有啥困难？他说：“技术有困难，工程师、技术员都能告诉你、帮助你；要看书，咱厂子买！”我住的离厂子远，工会就特意给我找了一间房子，为我一个人住着研究啥方便。工会主席还找木工给打了个制图板。
    为了我这事，党总支书记一连跟我谈了四、五天话，才把我领上明白道来。他说的话我记不清都是啥了，我就记的他告诉我“啥事都要为国家，不要为自个儿”；他就像看到我心里去似的，说的话句句听着透亮、顺心。以后，又听了几次党课，心里就越发明白了；我想，领导上这么帮助我，还不是为的把工厂搞好吗？我再怕这怕那的竟顾自个儿就不对了。想明白了，心里热乎乎的不好受，我就上领导同志那里检讨了自己，还递了入党申请书。我对党表示：“决心学习共产党员那样为国家为人民不怕艰苦的精神，跟同志们团结一起把工厂搞好！”
    永远跟着党的道儿走
    从打这，我就把厂子里要改的东西都当做自个儿的事一样，一有空儿，就跑到各处去看，不懂的就问别人。有一天听说咱厂子里一个二百马力的电滚烧坏了，就赶紧跑去看，一眼看见工人柳光彦正难过地在坏电滚那站着，我信口说：“这东西还得用人看着，里边发热也不知道，烧坏一个多大损失呀！”老柳说：“这可不好整，老虎还打盹呢，人那能看住它！”“要是电滚一热就叫唤你呢？”我这句话把老柳说笑了，他说：“马达会叫唤？真还没听说过，你创造个看吧！”当时我俩是说笑话，过后一想：“咱中国有多少厂子，有多少马达，要都烧坏了有多大损失！”这以后我就用上心了，自个儿不大懂电气，就按党告诉我的有事靠大家的办法到处打听。先头找电气工老刘把电滚的道理大概齐弄清楚了。又按寒暑表水银上升的道理，焊个铁盒，装上水银，借水银上升的力量顶个弹簧，弹簧再顶动闭闸开关，马达就自己能停住了。把这做完以后，头一回用热铁板一试，铁板不知怎的鼓起来了，水银一点也不动，铁板的焊口还开了。第二天一看，真怪！又出毛病了，那也没坏，水银淌了满地。这是怎回事呢？一想党告诉我有事找别人商量的话，我就找工程师去了，真多亏工程师的帮助，我才懂得了这个道理。回来就车个铁管，把水银装上，找两个电灯代替开关一试，还真好使。可是电灯近了行，一远了又不好使用了。我第二次找工程师，由工程师帮助我算了水银系数，才把马达高热停止器做好。把这个玩艺儿往电滚上一安，不用人看着电滚也烧不坏了。它一到五十度的时候，水银柱就顶上一个电铃开关，电铃就哗哗叫唤，人要是听不着也不要紧；水银柱升到六十度，又顶上闭闸开关，马上就把电滚停住了。工人们看这个玩艺儿挺新奇，就吵嚷开了：“真怪嗳！马达会叫人啦。”
    后来接连着我又把小吊车机和自动打模机研究成功了。这两件创造，也像研究马达高热停止器似的，都是有工程师和工人的帮助才成功的。在做小吊车和自动打模机的时候，我就想：不怪上级总说“劳技结合，发挥集体力量”，真是领导同志看的远；有点事难住了，大伙一凑主意，真管事，挺容易就能解决了。这些成功了以后我一算，头一个自动卷线机，我自个儿干，带带拉拉的总有半年工夫。后来集体创造的几件呢，搁一块也没用了两三个月。我想从这以后，下决心，永远跟着党的道儿走。到这我也懂得了，这些创造不是我一个人的光荣，它是党的光荣，是咱们工人阶级的光荣。为了保持这光荣我决不骄傲自满，我要把现在正在研究的三角钢绳和自动站台吊车等，早日创造成功，提高生产。
