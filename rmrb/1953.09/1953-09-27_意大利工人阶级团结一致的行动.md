Short commentary:

    The eight million Italian workers victoriously held a 24-hour national general strike on September 24, demanding wage increases and the signing of collective contracts, and protesting against the mass layoffs of workers. This general strike is the largest strike movement in Italy since the war, demonstrating the unprecedented growth and unity of the Italian working class. It is a struggle by the Italian working people to defend their vital interests, and also a powerful demonstration against the Italian ruling clique's continued pursuit of war policies.

    As everyone knows, due to the Italian reactionary government's following the United States in pursuing a policy of arms expansion and war preparation, Italy's economy is rapidly heading towards bankruptcy, and the lives of the working people are becoming increasingly impoverished. Various civilian factories have been reducing production or closing down, and tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs. According to the obviously reduced statistics of the Italian official, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed workers has exceeded six million, and the number of this unemployed army is continuing to increase. Because of high prices and increased taxes, the real wages of employed workers are also decreasing, and the income of ordinary workers is not even enough to cover half of the minimum living expenses of a family of four. The Italian monopoly capitalists, however, have obtained huge profits from this. For example, the profits of the Montecatini chemical trust increased from 3 billion lire in 1948 to 7.8 billion lire in 1952, and the situation is similar for most other large enterprises.

    In the parliamentary elections in June this year, the Italian working class united the majority of voters to vote against the disastrous policies of the Christian Democratic government. However, the Italian ruling clique obviously did not learn the lessons it should have from this election and the domestic situation after the election. The Bella government, which succeeded Gasperi, stated as soon as it took office that it would continue to implement the past foreign and domestic policies, and decided to increase military spending to a huge figure of 600 billion lire in the new fiscal year's national budget, while increasing taxes to cope with this huge military expenditure. This approach shows that the Bella government, like the Gasperi government, is determined to continue pushing Italy towards the dead end of economic collapse, regardless of the lives of the people. It is impossible to imagine that this policy will not be met with increasingly strong opposition from the Italian people. Recently, due to the further deterioration of the economic situation, the wave of layoffs has swept across Italy, and workers in various regions and industrial sectors have continuously held protest strikes to defend their right to live. Now, they have converged into a powerful torrent and launched a unified struggle.

    This general strike shows the strengthening of unity among the Italian working class in the struggle. The Italian ruling class has attempted to use scabs to weaken the fighting will of the working class and undermine the unity of the working class. Facts have proved that these conspiracies have suffered a serious failure. In this strike, the trade union organizations of the Christian Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party had to take unified action with the Italian General Confederation of Labour, which truly represents the interests of the working class, because they did not dare to openly violate the will of the vast majority of their members. In many cities, not a single worker stopped working during the strike. Many workers who had never participated in the labor movement also joined the ranks of the battle this time. This shows that the Italian working masses are becoming more and more united in the struggle for their vital interests and national survival. The increased unity of the Italian working class is undoubtedly an important guarantee for the victory of the Italian people's struggle for peace, democracy and national independence.

    Peace-loving people in all countries express great sympathy for the struggle of the Italian working class to improve their living conditions, and believe that their struggle will continue to be victorious.

### 意大利工人阶级团结一致的行动

    意大利工人阶级团结一致的行动
    八百万意大利工人于九月二十四日胜利地举行了全国二十四小时的总罢工，要求增加工资和订立集体合同、抗议大批解雇工人。这次总罢工是意大利战后以来规模最大的一次罢工运动，它显示了意大利工人阶级力量的空前壮大和步伐一致。它是意大利劳动人民维护自己切身利益而进行的斗争，也是反对意大利统治集团继续奉行战争政策的一次强有力的示威行动。
    大家知道，由于意大利的反动政府追随美国推行扩军备战政策，意大利的经济迅速走向破产，劳动人民的生活日益贫困。各种民用工厂纷纷减产或倒闭，成千上万的工人失去了工作。根据意大利官方显然缩小的统计数字，失业和半失业工人已超过六百万，而这支失业大军的人数正继续不断增加。因为物价高涨和捐税加重，有工作的工人的实际工资也愈来愈减少，一般工人的收入还不够四口之家的最低生活费用的一半。而意大利的垄断资本家却从中获得了巨额的利润。例如蒙特卡提尼化学托辣斯的利润就从一九四八年的三十亿里拉增加到一九五二年的七十八亿里拉，其他大企业的情况也多数如此。
    在今年六月的议会选举中，意大利的工人阶级便曾团结了大多数选民投票反对天主教民主党政府的灾难政策。但是意大利统治集团显然并没有从这次选举和选举后的国内局势取得应有的教训。接替加斯贝利的贝拉政府，一上台就表示继续执行过去的外交和内政政策，决定在新会计年度的国家预算中把军费增到六千亿里拉的巨额数字，而以增加税收来应付这庞大的军事开支。这种作法，说明贝拉政府一如加斯贝利政府，决意要把意大利继续推向经济崩溃的绝路，而不顾人民的死活。人们不可能设想，这种政策会不遭到意大利人民愈益强烈的反对。最近以来，由于经济情况的进一步恶化，解雇工人的浪潮席卷意大利全国，各地区、各产业部门的工人不断地举行抗议罢工，以保卫自己的生活权利。现在，他们汇合成为强大的巨流，展开了统一的斗争。
    这一次总罢工显示了意大利工人阶级在斗争中团结的加强。意大利统治阶级曾经企图利用工贼来削弱工人阶级的斗争意志，破坏工人阶级的团结。事实证明这些阴谋已遭到严重的失败。在这一次罢工中，天主教民主党和社会民主党的工会组织，由于不敢公然违背广大会员的意志，也不得不与真正代表工人阶级利益的意大利总工会采取一致行动。在许多城市中，没有一个工人在罢工期间不停止工作。许多从来没有参加过工人运动的工人群众，这一次也投入了战斗的行列。这表明了意大利工人群众在为切身利益和民族生存而进行的斗争中，是愈来愈团结一致了。意大利工人阶级团结力量的增强，对意大利人民争取和平、民主与民族独立斗争的胜利无疑是一个重要的保证。
    各国爱好和平的人民对意大利工人阶级为改善生活条件而进行的斗争，表示极大的同情，并相信他们的斗争将不断取得胜利。
