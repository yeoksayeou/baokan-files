Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: The new semester at Renmin University of China has begun. On September 1st, the official start date, both teachers and students arrived early for class. The university president, along with heads of various departments and offices, visited classrooms to observe and listen to lectures. Students were in high spirits and focused, with excellent teaching order and effectiveness. The students highly value the school's excellent tradition of strict discipline. In the past, the rate of student absenteeism at Renmin University was only one in ten thousand, and everyone is determined to maintain this honor.

Nearly eight thousand students from all over the country returned to the university before the start of the semester. On August 30th, the school held a mobilization meeting for the new semester. President Wu Yuzhang, in his speech, expressed special concern and welcome to the more than three thousand new students who had arrived at Renmin University. He pointed out that Renmin University bears a significant responsibility in accelerating the country's industrialization. He encouraged everyone to wholeheartedly complete the learning tasks entrusted to them by the Party and the state. Vice Presidents Hu Xikui and Zou Lufeng respectively introduced to the students the teaching principles of Renmin University: integrating theory with practice, combining Soviet experience with China's specific conditions, combining politics with professional skills in teaching, and cultivating new-type intellectuals with worker-peasant backgrounds. They encouraged everyone to pay special attention to the study of Marxism-Leninism and to develop the habits of engaging in mental labor and diligent study.

Renmin University of China is the largest higher education institution of finance and economics in our country. This year, the former Central Institute of Finance and Economics and the Finance and Economics Department of Shanxi University have been merged into Renmin University. The task of Renmin University is to train cadres in various aspects of national economic construction, as well as to train some diplomatic and legal personnel. Currently, the university has nine departments: Economic Planning, Statistics, Finance and Credit, Industrial Economics, Cooperative Economics, Trade, Law, Diplomacy, and Russian. This year, the university has established specialized courses in Economic Planning, Public Finance and Banking, Foreign Trade, Domestic Trade, Cooperative Economics, Factory Management, Statistics, and Diplomacy affiliated with the relevant departments, as well as independent specialized courses in Archives, Labor, and Insurance. Under the leadership of the Academic Affairs Department and various departments, forty-three teaching and research sections have been established. Seventy percent of the university's students are revolutionary cadres and industrial workers, and the rest are young intellectuals. The university has nearly two thousand graduate students, training teachers for universities across the country.

At the beginning of the semester, the president and other school leaders paid special attention to the students' health, visiting the student cafeteria and dormitories to check on their food and living conditions. Older students warmly welcomed the new students, actively taking care of them, introducing them to the school, and sharing their learning experiences, fully demonstrating a spirit of friendship and unity.
