The Beijing People's Court recently sentenced those responsible for the serious fire at the Beijing Trust Company's Storage and Transportation Department's Transportation Division affiliated temporary warehouse. Hou Boyan, the warehouse administrator primarily responsible for the fire, was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for serious dereliction of duty. Other relevant personnel also received legal or administrative punishments.

The course of the fire was as follows: On May 8th, the company accepted six boxes of waste film weighing 430 kilograms entrusted by the Shenyang Municipal Industry Bureau for transportation to Shenyang. The next day, for ease of transport, the cargo owner suggested to the company that the six boxes be repackaged into seven boxes, with two layers: an outer layer of wood and an inner layer of iron, which needed to be sealed by welding. After accepting this task, on the morning of the 13th, the company staff found welders Sun Wanzhong and Wu Wendian and had them weld near the door inside the warehouse. Due to the excessive heat of the solder, the waste film inside the boxes caught fire, immediately spreading to the flammable goods stored in the warehouse. The fire was intense, destroying 540 feet of oilcloth, as well as many medicines, medium-grade paper, and other items. The porters Zhang Enlin and welder Sun Wanzhong, who were inside the warehouse at the time, were unable to escape and were burned to death. The other welder, Wu Wendian, died after being rescued from the fire. Du Zhenying, a cadre of the Trust Company, was also burned.

After the incident, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Supervisory Committee investigated the fire. The investigation concluded that warehouse administrator Hou Boyan violated safety regulations, thus causing the fire and should bear the primary responsibility. Two days before the fire (the 11th), Hou Boyan had asked Beijing porter Zhang Enlin to find a welder for him. Zhang told him that waste film was easily ignited by heat and that this welding method was unsafe, refusing to find a welder for him. Hou Boyan had previously worked as a welder himself and had the basic knowledge that soldering could cause a fire. However, due to his serious negligence of safety and failure to cherish state property, he found a welder himself to do the work. When the fire first started, if Hou Boyan had genuinely exerted himself to move the boxes, he could have pushed them out the door, preventing the fire from spreading. But he did not do so, only pushing once without moving the boxes, and then left, ultimately causing the fire. Based on the above circumstances, the Beijing People's Court sentenced the principal offender, Hou Boyan, to seven years imprisonment. Gao Zongda, a business clerk in the Trust Company's Transportation Division, violated the company's instructions and warehouse operating regulations by accepting the easily flammable waste film without authorization, and failed to fulfill his supervisory guidance responsibilities after accepting it. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment for dereliction of duty. Zhang Shiji, the head of the Trust Company's Railway Transportation Group, violated the company's warehouse operating regulations by blindly accepting the transport of flammable goods and was sentenced to six months imprisonment. Li Songshan, the head of the Trust Company's Storage and Transportation Department's Transportation Division, Wang Guodong, the manager of the Trust Company, Liu Hualong, the deputy manager, and Zhou Zizhong, the head of the Storage and Transportation Department, were all given administrative punishments for neglecting safety work.

    北京市信托公司临时仓库失火案
    北京市人民法院已作严肃处理
    主要负责者侯伯彦判处七年徒刑
    北京市人民法院最近判决了北京市信托公司储运科运输股附属临时仓库的严重失火案件。火灾主要负责者仓库管理员侯伯彦严重违法失职，被判处徒刑七年，其他有关人员也都分别受到了法律处分或行政处分。
    这件火灾的经过是这样：五月八日，该公司接受沈阳市工业局委托运往沈阳的废电影片六箱，共重四百三十公斤。次日，为了起运方便起见，由货主向该公司建议由六箱改装成七箱，箱子分两层，外面一层木板，里面一层铁皮，铁皮需要焊封。该公司工作人员接受这一任务后，在十三日上午找来焊工孙万忠、吴文典，让他们在仓库里靠门口的地方焊活；因焊锡热度过高，引起箱内废影片燃烧起火，立刻延烧了库内存放的易燃品。火势很猛，烧毁油布五百四十尺，及许多药品、中光纸等物；当时在仓库内的搬运工人章恩林和焊工孙万忠不及冲出，都被烧死；另一焊工吴文典冲出火后，救治无效身死。信托公司干部杜振英也被烧伤。
    事后北京市人民政府监察委员会对这一失火案作了调查。调查结果是：仓库管理员侯伯彦违反保安规定，因而酿成火灾，应负主要责任。在火灾发生前两天（十一日）侯伯彦曾找北京市搬运工人章恩林代找焊工，章告诉他废电影片见热容易起火，这种焊法不安全，拒绝为他找焊工。侯伯彦过去曾做过焊工。也有锡焊可能引起火灾的常识；但由于他严重忽视安全，不爱惜国家财产，就自己找了焊工来做。在刚起火时，侯伯彦如果能真正用力搬动箱子，是可以把箱子推到门外，避免扩大火灾的。但他没有这样做，只是推了一把，箱子未移地方，自己就走了，终于酿成火灾。根据以上情况，北京市人民法院判处主犯侯伯彦徒刑七年。信托公司运输股业务员高宗达，违反该公司的指示和仓库经营规章，擅自接受容易燃烧的废影片，且在接受后，未尽监督指导责任，是一种失职行为，判处徒刑一年。信托公司铁路运输组组长张士骥，违反该公司仓库经营规章规定，盲目接收承运易燃品，判处徒刑六个月。信托公司储运科运输股股长李松山、信托公司经理王国栋、副经理刘化龙、储运科科长周子仲等四人因忽视安全工作，都分别受到了行政处分。
