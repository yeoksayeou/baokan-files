    Chaotic Traffic Order at Hejiafen Sand and Gravel Pit in Beijing Affects Transportation
    A letter from Xing Yulu of the New Beijing Traffic Team of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Traffic Brigade: Sand and gravel are indispensable materials for basic construction projects. Hejiafen, Liang Gong'an, Shijingshan District, Beijing, is a place with very rich sand and gravel deposits. With the progress of the capital's basic construction projects, many public and private manufacturers are mining sand and gravel in this area. The average daily number of motorized and non-motorized vehicles transporting sand and gravel reaches 5,000. However, due to a lack of sound management, the traffic order in this area is very chaotic, which affects transportation work. The situation is as follows: Some private sand and gravel manufacturers, for the sake of convenient mining, disregard the safety of the roads and have dug up the roads in some places, leaving only a small path. The narrowest part is only three meters wide. The road is too narrow and uneven, and vehicles constantly fall into ditches and collide with each other. Since March, there have been 23 major and minor traffic accidents. At the same time, vehicles carrying sand and gravel scramble to pass first, often squeezing together and blocking traffic, seriously wasting transportation time.
    This chaotic situation must be improved. The district should quickly resolve the traffic safety issues, ensuring that fast and slow vehicles transport in an orderly manner, so as to improve vehicle turnover rate, ensure the completion of sand and gravel transportation tasks, and support the capital's basic construction. It is hoped that relevant units such as the People's Government of Shijingshan District of Beijing Municipality, the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, and the Beijing-Tianjin Highway Transportation Bureau will pay attention to this issue.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    北京市何家坟砂石场交通秩序混乱影响运输
    北京市公安局交通大队新北京交通队邢玉禄来信：砂石是基本建设工程中不可缺少的材料。北京市郊石景山区梁公庵何家坟是砂石埋藏量很丰富的地方。随着首都基本建设工程的进展，该地有不少公私营厂商在开采砂石，运输砂石的机动车和非机动车每天平均达五千辆车次。但是，这个地方因为缺乏健全的管理，交通秩序十分混乱，以致影响了运输工作。事情是这样的：某些私营砂石厂商为了开采方便，竟不顾行车道路的安全，把某些地方的马路掘得剩了一条小径，其中最窄的地方只有三公尺宽。马路过窄，道又不平，车辆堕沟和互撞事件就不断发生，从三月到现在，大小车祸已达二十三起。同时，载运砂石的车辆争先抢行，经常挤在一起而阻塞交通，严重地浪费了运输时间。
    这种混乱现象必须改善。该区应该迅速解决交通安全问题，务使快、慢车辆有条不紊地载运，以提高车辆周转率，保证完成砂石运输任务，支援首都的基本建设。希望北京市石景山区人民政府、北京市建筑工程局和京津公路运输局等有关单位重视这个问题。
