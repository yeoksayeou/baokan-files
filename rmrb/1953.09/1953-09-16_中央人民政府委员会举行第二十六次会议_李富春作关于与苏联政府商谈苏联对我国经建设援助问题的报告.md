Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The Central People's Government Committee held its twenty-sixth meeting on the afternoon of the 15th. The meeting heard and approved the "Report on Negotiations with the Soviet Government Regarding Soviet Assistance to China's Economic Construction" delivered by Li Fuchun, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, and adopted a telegram of thanks to the government of the great ally, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

In his report, Li Fuchun, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, gave a detailed explanation of the tasks and principles of China's first Five-Year Plan, the results of negotiations with the Soviet government, and the work we should be doing currently.

Regarding the tasks and principles of China's first Five-Year Plan, Deputy Director Li said that, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the basic task of China's first Five-Year Plan is: First, to concentrate major efforts on developing heavy industry and establishing the foundation for national industrialization and modernization of national defense; correspondingly, to cultivate construction talent, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and expand commerce; to promote the collectivization of agriculture and handicrafts and to transform private industry and commerce in a step-by-step manner, and to correctly utilize the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. All of this is to ensure the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy, and to ensure the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of production development. That is to say:

    First, in the process of China's economic construction, the proportion of socialist components must continue to grow. This is the fundamental path for China's economic development.

    Second, in the process of China's economic construction, the positive aspects of the capitalist economy must be correctly utilized.

    Third, to ensure national construction and to realize national industrialization, the worker-peasant alliance must be further consolidated.

    Fourth, the role of existing industrial bases must be brought into play, and the establishment of new industrial bases must be actively undertaken.

    Fifth, on the basis of production development, the material and cultural living standards of the working people must be gradually improved. This is the purpose of our national construction and must be specifically stipulated in the plan as possible.

    Sixth, China's Five-Year Plan must have certain reserves to ensure the completion of the plan and to prepare conditions for the second Five-Year Plan, especially the preparation of resource conditions and technical conditions.

When talking about the results of negotiations with the Soviet government, Deputy Director Li said that the Soviet government agreed to meet the requirements of the Chinese government and decided to give China's economic construction long-term, comprehensive and massive assistance. Including the enterprises that have been designed with Soviet assistance in the past three years, by 1959, the Soviet government will help China build and renovate 141 large-scale projects, including iron and steel complexes, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, coal mines, oil refineries, machinery manufacturing plants, automobile factories, tractor manufacturing plants, power stations, etc. After these enterprises are built, China's industrial production capacity will greatly increase. At that time, China will become a country with its own independent industry, and China's industrialization will gain a solid foundation.

Then Deputy Director Li emphasized that the enterprises that the Soviet Union is helping China build are providing comprehensive assistance from start to finish, from selecting the factory site, collecting design basic data, determining the design task book of the enterprise, conducting design, supplying equipment, guiding construction and installation and start-up operation, all the way to the manufacture of new products, and providing technical data for the manufacture of new products free of charge. In order to enable us to master the newly built and renovated enterprises, the Soviet government vigorously assists us in training technical personnel, and will accept workers and engineering and technical personnel dispatched by our country every year to the Soviet enterprises for production technology internships in various specialties, and will send various experts to China. The assistance given and to be given by the Soviet Union to China's economic construction demonstrates the great internationalist spirit of socialist countries. The Soviet government has fully met our requirements for everything that is necessary, feasible, and that we cannot do on our own. Not only that, but the Soviet side has also added design projects for us that we should have done but did not consider.

The above situation fully proves Comrade Stalin's famous thesis on the economic relations between countries in the peaceful democratic camp: "...lies in the economic integration of these countries in the post-war period, and the establishment of economic cooperation and mutual assistance. The experience of this cooperation shows that no capitalist country can give the People's Democracies real help and technically sophisticated help like the Soviet Union. The problem is not only that this assistance is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The problem is first of all that the basis of this cooperation is mutual assistance and a sincere desire to seek common economic upsurge. As a result, there has been a high rate of industrial development in these countries." Just as Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou said in their congratulatory telegram to Malenkov and Molotov on September 2 this year: "The fraternal assistance given by the Soviet Union to the Chinese people is an important factor in the rapid recovery of the Chinese economy and its embarkation on the road of planned construction."

It is very obvious that without the above-mentioned assistance from the Soviet Union, China's first Five-Year Plan would not have the current scale and speed, and would encounter great difficulties.

When talking about the work we should be doing currently, Deputy Director Li pointed out that this year is the first year of China's construction plan, and we must mobilize and organize the people of the whole country to work hard to increase production, do a good job in basic construction, practice strict economy, and strive to overfulfill this year's plan. In addition to the above, we should also carry out the following work for China's long-term construction, namely: taking the enterprises that the Soviet Union helps us build and renovate as the backbone, formulating the outline of China's first Five-Year Plan in accordance with the law of proportional development of the national economy; vigorously cultivating construction cadres in a planned way; implementing Chairman Mao's instructions to learn from the Soviet Union, and conscientiously learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and learn from Soviet science and technology.

Deputy Director Li pointed out at the end of his report: In order to realize the great ideal of national industrialization, extremely arduous and glorious tasks are placed before the people and cadres of the whole country. Our cause has difficulties, but these are difficulties in development, and difficulties that can be overcome. We have the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, we have brave and hardworking people, we have the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations in the country, we have the sincere assistance of the great Soviet Union, and we have the support of progressive mankind all over the world. As long as we can firmly grasp the guidelines and policies instructed by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, be good at relying on the masses of the people, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, sincerely learn from the Soviet Union, and summarize various correct and wrong, successful or failed experiences in our work in a timely and conscientious manner, and adopt scientific methods and an honest, prudent, humble and persevering attitude, then China's construction cause will surely succeed.

After Deputy Director Li Fuchun's report, Committee Members Zhang Bojun, Cheng Qian, Fu Zuoyi, Situ Meitang, and Vice Chairman Gao Gang spoke successively.

Committee Member Zhang Bojun said: The ideal of national independence and national prosperity and strength that the Chinese people have been striving for for more than 100 years has been realized today under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. The Chinese people thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao with infinite gratitude, and thank the great ally, the Soviet Union, and must unite and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's guiding principle of national industrialization with practical actions.

Committee Member Cheng Qian said: The Soviet Union's assistance to China's economic construction is comprehensive and sincere and selfless. Such a large-scale economic assistance between countries has never existed in history, and is absolutely impossible in the capitalist world. China's history of blood and tears for more than a century is a vivid example. This is a vivid and practical education for the Chinese people.

Committee Member Fu Zuoyi said: Thanks to the long-term struggle of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, our country has begun to enter the period of national construction. The Soviet Union's huge and selfless assistance to our country will greatly enhance the strength and confidence of the Chinese people in carrying out construction. The people of the whole country should follow Chairman Mao's instructions, work hard to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to realize China's industrialization.

Committee Member Situ Meitang said: Mr. Sun Yat-sen taught the Chinese people before his death to "take Russia as a teacher," and Chairman Mao taught the Chinese people to "lean to one side," and stand on the side of the world's peaceful democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union. This is a truth that has been proven by countless facts. The people of the whole country should sincerely learn from the Soviet Union, and under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the generous assistance of the Soviet Union, build a poor and backward China into a prosperous and advanced industrial country through self-reliance.

Vice Chairman Gao Gang emphasized the importance of concentrating efforts on developing heavy industry in his speech. He said: Only by focusing on the development of heavy industry first can we realize industrialization, consolidate national defense, open up broad prospects for the development of agriculture, make the country rich and strong, and truly improve the lives of the people of the whole country. This is the real "benevolent government." Otherwise, industry cannot develop, and the people's lives cannot be fundamentally improved. National construction is an arduous task. With the strong assistance of the Soviet Union, the people of the whole country should work hard to learn from the Soviet Union, train their own experts, bring into play the existing industrial production potential, and establish new industrial bases. As long as the people of the whole country are better organized, united as one, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, self-reliantly and actively work hard, China's great construction plan will surely be successfully completed.

After discussion, the meeting unanimously approved the report of Deputy Director Li Fuchun, and approved the telegram of thanks to the government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The following attended the meeting: Chairman of the Central People's Government Mao Zedong, Vice Chairmen Liu Shaoqi, Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Gao Gang, and a total of forty committee members. Those who attended the meeting as observers included members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, members of the State Council of the Central People's Government and the heads of various committees, ministries, commissions, academies, departments, and banks under the State Council, members of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, leaders of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Deputy President of the Supreme People's Court, the Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, members of the State Planning Commission, heads of various people's organizations, and the mayors and deputy mayors of Beijing and Tianjin, totaling 274 people.

    中央人民政府委员会举行第二十六次会议
    李富春作关于与苏联政府商谈苏联对我国经建设援助问题的报告
    【新华社十五日讯】中央人民政府委员会在十五日下午举行第二十六次会议。这次会议听了和批准了中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会副主任李富春所作的“关于与苏联政府商谈苏联对我国经济建设援助问题的报告”，通过了向伟大盟邦苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府的致谢电。
    政务院财政经济委员会副主任李富春在报告中分别就我国第一个五年建设计划的任务和方针、与苏联政府商谈的结果及我们当前应做的工作，作了详细的说明。
    关于我国第一个五年建设计划的任务和方针问题，李副主任说，根据毛主席的指示，我国第一个五年建设计划的基本任务是：首先集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础；相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和扩大商业；有步骤地促进农业和手工业的合作化和进行对私营工商业的改造，并正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用。所有这些，都是为了保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重的稳步增长，为了保证在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民物质生活和文化生活的水平。这就是说：
    第一、在我国经济建设的过程中，必须使社会主义成份的比重不断增长，这是我国发展经济的根本道路。
    第二、在我国经济建设的过程中，必须正确地利用资本主义经济的积极性。
    第三、要保证国家的建设，要实现国家工业化，就必须进一步巩固工农联盟。
    第四、发挥现有工业基地的作用，并积极着手建立新的工业基地。
    第五、在生产发展的基础上，逐步提高劳动人民物质和文化生活的水平，这是我们国家建设的目的，必须在制定计划时根据可能作具体的规定。
    第六、必须使我国的五年建设计划有一定的后备，以保证计划的完成，并为第二个五年建设准备条件，特别是准备资源的条件和技术的条件。在谈到与苏联政府商谈的结果时，李副主任说，苏联政府同意满足我国政府的要求，决定给我国经济建设以长期的、全面的巨大援助。连同过去三年来帮助我国设计的企业在内，至一九五九年为止，苏联政府将帮助我国新建与改建一百四十一项规模巨大的工程，其中包括钢铁联合企业、有色冶金企业、煤矿、炼油厂、机器制造厂、汽车厂、拖拉机制造厂、电力站等。当这些企业建成以后，我国的工业生产能力将大大增长，那时我国将成为一个自己有独立的工业的国家，我国的工业化将获得一个稳固的基础。
    接着李副主任强调指出：苏联帮助我国建设的企业，从选择厂址，搜集设计基础资料，确定企业的设计任务书，进行设计，供应设备，指导建筑安装和开工运转，一直到新产品制造，无偿地供给制造新产品的技术资料等等，都是从头到尾地全面给予援助的。苏联政府为了使我们能掌握新建与改建的企业，大力协助我们培养技术人员，将接受我国每年派遣为着新建工厂生产的工人和工程技术人员到苏联企业中按各项专业进行生产技术实习，并将派遣各种专家来中国。苏联对我国经济建设所给予的援助及将给予的援助，表现了社会主义国家伟大的国际主义精神。凡是必要的，有条件办的，并且单靠我们自己办不到的，苏联政府都充分地满足了我们的要求。不仅如此，应该办而我们没有考虑到的，苏联方面还为我们增加了设计项目。
    上述情况完全证明了斯大林同志关于和平民主阵营各国经济关系的著名论点：“……在于战后时期中这些国家在经济上结合起来了，并且建立好了经济上的合作和互助。这个合作的经验表明，没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。结果，在这些国家中便有了高速度的工业发展。”也正如毛主席和周总理在今年九月二日致马林科夫、莫洛托夫的贺电中所说：“苏联给予中国人民的兄弟般的帮助，乃是中国经济迅速恢复和走上有计划建设道路的重要因素。”
    非常明显，我国第一个五年建设如果没有苏联的上述帮助，就不可能有现在的规模和速度，而且要遇到很大的困难。
    在谈到我们当前应做的工作时，李副主任指出，今年是我国建设计划开始的第一年，我们必须动员和组织全国人民努力增加生产，搞好基本建设，厉行节约，争取超额完成今年的计划。除上述以外，还应为我国的长期建设，进行以下工作，即：以苏联帮助我们建设和改建的企业为骨干，按照国民经济按比例发展的法则，制定我国第一个五年建设计划大纲；有计划地大力培养建设干部；贯彻毛主席学习苏联的指示，认真学习苏联先进的经验，学习苏联的科学技术。
    李副主任在结束报告时指出：为了实现国家工业化的伟大理想，在全国人民和全体干部面前摆着极其艰巨的和光荣的任务。我们的事业是有困难的，但这是发展中的困难，可以克服的困难。我们有伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导，有勇敢勤劳的人民，有全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的团结和合作，有伟大苏联真诚的援助，有全世界进步人类的支持。只要我们能够紧紧地掌握中国共产党中央和毛主席指示的方针和政策，善于依靠人民群众，集中群众的智慧，诚心诚意地向苏联学习，及时地和认真地总结工作中的各种正确的和错误的、成功的或失败的经验，采取科学的方法和老实审慎、谦虚坚忍的态度，那么，我国的建设事业就一定会成功。
    在李富春副主任报告以后，章伯钧委员、程潜委员、傅作义委员、司徒美堂委员、高岗副主席相继发言。
    章伯钧委员说：中国人民一百多年来所争取的民族独立和国家富强的理想，今天在中国共产党、毛主席的领导下，在苏联真诚无私的援助下实现了。中国人民以无限感激的心情感谢中国共产党和毛主席，感谢伟大的盟邦苏联，一定要团结一致地、以实际行动来坚决执行毛主席指示的国家工业化的方针。
    程潜委员说：苏联对我国经济建设的援助，是全面的，是真诚无私的。这样一个国与国之间的规模巨大的经济援助，在历史上不曾有过，而在资本主义世界中是绝对不可能有的。中国百余年来血泪交织的历史，就是一个鲜明的例证。这对于我国人民来说，是一次生动的实际的教育。
    傅作义委员说：由于中国共产党的长期奋斗和毛主席的英明领导，我国已经开始进入国家建设时期。苏联对我国的巨大无私的援助将大大地增强我国人民进行建设的力量和信心。全国人民应遵循毛主席的指示，努力增加生产，厉行节约，为实现我国工业化而奋斗。
    司徒美堂委员说：孙中山先生生前教导中国人民要“以俄为师”，毛主席教导我国人民要“一边倒”，站在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的一边，这是被无数事实所证明了的真理。全国人民应该真诚地向苏联学习，在毛主席的正确领导和苏联的慷慨援助之下，自力更生地把贫困的落后的中国建设成为富强的先进的工业国。
    高岗副主席在发言中强调指出集中力量发展重工业的重要性。他说：只有首先着重发展重工业，才能实现工业化，巩固国防，为农业开辟广大的发展前途，使国家富强起来，使全国人民的生活真正改善。这才是真正的大“仁政”。否则工业不能发展，人民生活也是不可能根本改善的。国家建设是一个繁重的任务，全国人民应在苏联的大力援助下，努力学习苏联，培养自己的专家，发挥现有的工业生产潜力，建立新的工业基地。只要全国人民更好的组织起来，万众一心，在毛主席的领导下，自力更生地积极努力，我国的伟大的建设计划一定能胜利完成。
    会议经过讨论后，一致通过了李富春副主任的报告，并通过了给苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府的致谢电。
    出席这次会议的，有：中央人民政府主席毛泽东，副主席刘少奇、宋庆龄、李济深、张澜、高岗及委员共四十人。列席这次会议的有中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在京委员，中央人民政府政务院政务委员及政务院所属各委、部、会、院、署、行的负责人，中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会委员，中国人民志愿军领导人员，最高人民法院副院长，最高人民检察署副检察长，国家计划委员会委员，各人民团体负责人和北京、天津两市市长、副市长等共二百七十四人。
