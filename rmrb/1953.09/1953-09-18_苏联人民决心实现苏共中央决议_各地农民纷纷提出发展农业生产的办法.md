    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: The Soviet working people warmly welcome the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on measures for the further development of agriculture. People in various regions have held rallies, expressing their determination to fight resolutely to implement this resolution.
    The Moscow Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a plenary session on the 15th. The meeting heard and discussed the report by Mikhailov, the first secretary of the regional committee, on "The Summary of the Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee and the Tasks of the Moscow Party Organization in Further Developing Agriculture." Mikhailov and those who participated in the discussion at the meeting unanimously pointed out that the great program formulated by the Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee to vigorously develop all sectors of agriculture has inspired the working people of Moscow Oblast and the entire Soviet Union, and has aroused a new upsurge in the political and labor enthusiasm of the masses. The plenary session of the Moscow Oblast Committee unanimously supported this program and made a decision on how to implement it.
    The All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences also held a meeting in Moscow on the 15th to discuss the tasks of agricultural scientific workers in further developing agriculture. Benediktov, Minister of Agriculture and Agricultural Storage of the Soviet Union, reported on the tasks of agricultural scientific workers in completing the resolutions of the Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee. The meeting also heard a report by Academician Lysenko on the latest research on improving plant soil. Academician Lysenko concluded, "Scientific workers should, in close cooperation with agricultural workers, eliminate the phenomenon that agricultural science lags behind practice, and should do their utmost to solve the enormous tasks facing domestic agriculture."
    Farmers in various regions of the Soviet Union enthusiastically responded to the call of the CPSU Central Committee and proposed specific goals and methods for continuously improving agricultural production. The Molotov Collective Farm in the Lamin District of Moscow Oblast, mentioned in the resolution of the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, is an advanced livestock collective farm. This farm has good harvests every year. This year, the farm harvested one hundred poods of grain per hectare (one hectare equals fifteen mu), or 45,000 kilograms of early-maturing cabbage, or 15,000 to 20,000 kilograms of potatoes. Currently, the farm members are harvesting potatoes with high enthusiasm. Puzanchikov, the chairman of the collective farm, said: In response to the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, their collective farm will also increase the products of various livestock and increase the output of potatoes, vegetables, and feed. Last year, each cow produced 4,343 kilograms of milk, and the farm members guaranteed to strive for 5,500 kilograms of milk per cow this year. The members of the Lenin Collective Farm in Tashkent enthusiastically read the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee published in the newspaper. A. Kuchkarov, chairman of the collective farm, said: Our farm is one of the largest collective farms in the Uzbek Republic. We once guaranteed to harvest an average of 3,700 kilograms of cotton per hectare from 2,112 hectares of cotton fields. Now, we must strive to exceed this guarantee. Mu. Mazabayeva, the female captain of the second field work team, also proposed that all cotton should be harvested in a timely and lossless manner before the end of October. Originally, advanced cotton pickers picked 120 to 130 kilograms of cotton per day, with a quota of 50 kilograms; but now all female workers guarantee to pick 120 to 130 kilograms per day, and advanced female workers pick 150 kilograms.

    苏联人民决心实现苏共中央决议
    各地农民纷纷提出发展农业生产的办法
    【新华社莫斯科十七日电】苏联劳动人民热烈欢迎苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议关于进一步发展农业的措施的决议。各地人民纷纷举行集会，他们在会上表示了要为实现这个决议而坚决奋斗的决心。
    苏联共产党莫斯科州委员会在十五日举行了全体会议。会议听取并讨论了州委员会第一书记米哈伊洛夫的报告：“关于党中央委员会全体会议的总结和莫斯科党组织在进一步发展农业方面的任务”。米哈伊洛夫和在会上参加讨论的人一致指出，党中央委员会全体会议制定的大力发展农业各部门的伟大纲领，鼓舞了莫斯科州和全苏联的劳动人民，引起了群众的政治和劳动积极性的新高潮。莫斯科州委员会全体会议一致拥护这个纲领，并且作出了关于实现这个纲领的办法的决定。
    全苏列宁农业科学院也在十五日在莫斯科举行了会议，讨论了农业科学工作者在进一步发展农业方面的任务。苏联农业和农业储存部部长别涅吉克托夫在会上报告了农业科学工作者在完成党中央全体会议的决议方面的任务。会议并听取了李森科院士关于改良植物土壤的最近研究情况的报告。李森科院士最后说：“科学工作者应当在和农业劳动者紧密合作中，消除农业科学落后于实际的现象，应当以全力解决国内农业所面临的巨大任务。”
    苏联各地农民热烈响应苏共中央的号召，纷纷提出了不断提高农业生产的具体目标和办法。莫斯科州拉明区莫洛托夫集体农庄，是苏共中央全体会议的决议中提到的一个先进的饲畜集体农庄。这个农庄年年都得到好收成。今年，该农庄每公顷田地
    （每公顷合十五亩）收获了一百普特谷物（一普特合三十二点七六市斤），或四万五千公斤早熟白菜，或一万五千到两万公斤马铃薯。现在，庄员们正以高涨的热情收获马铃薯。集体农庄主席普赞奇科夫表示：为了响应党中央全体会议的决议，他们的集体农庄还要提高各种牲畜的产品，增加马铃薯、蔬菜和饲料的产量。这个农庄去年每头母牛挤乳四千三百四十三公斤，庄员们保证在今年争取每头母牛挤乳五千五百公斤。塔什干列宁集体农庄庄员们热心地阅读了报纸上登载的苏共中央的决议。农庄主席阿·库奇卡罗夫说：我们农庄是乌兹别克共和国最大的一个集体农庄。我们曾经保证要从二千一百一十二公顷的棉田上平均每公顷收三千七百公斤棉花。现在，我们要争取超过这个保证。田间工作队第二队女队长穆·马扎巴耶娃还提出建议，要在十月底以前及时和毫无损失地收获完全部棉花。原来先进的采棉女工每天收棉一百二、三十公斤，定额为五十公斤；但现在全体女工保证每天收一百二、三十公斤，先进的女工收一百五十公斤。
