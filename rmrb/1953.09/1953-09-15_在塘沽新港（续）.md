    At Tanggu New Port (Continued)
    By Our Correspondent Lin Li
    The Drifting City
    Standing on the docks of Tanggu New Port, if you carefully observe the port area's water surface, you'll discover: there's a clear, green stream, like a line, dividing the sea into two halves. This clear stream is the man-made main channel. It's a total of 15.2 kilometers long, 60 meters wide, and reaches a depth of minus seven meters; during high tide, there will be about ten meters of water. With this main channel, ships with a draft of twenty-seven feet can directly sail to the docks of the new port and dock.

    The main channel was primarily dredged by self-propelled dredgers.

    One morning, I took a marine surveyor's tugboat, left the land, and arrived at the self-propelled dredger "Kuai Li." The construction and operation of this type of ship are, in many respects, the opposite of suction dredgers. The self-propelled dredger has a large belly called the mud hold. It drags an iron "rake" under its stern. When working, the "rake" is lowered to the seabed, and the silt rolls into the mud hold with a swooshing sound. Then, it carries this bellyful of silt, navigates on its own (other types of ships need to be towed by tugboats) to the sea outside the main channel, dumps the mud there, and then returns lightly to carry out the next dredging. The "Kuai Li" is the smallest of the three major self-propelled dredgers. But it can dredge away 500 cubic meters of silt at a time. Comrade Gao Guodong, the person in charge of the ship, introduced me to the fact that last year, it took this ship 30-32 minutes to dredge each hold of mud. This year, it only takes 21-24 minutes. However, last year, it and its sister ship, the "Jun Li," completed the equivalent of the total workload of the previous five years. Despite such great achievements, the crew members are not satisfied. This year, according to the new quota, the "Kuai Li" dredges 900 cubic meters of mud per hour. But the crew members have already broken this figure, reaching a dredging volume of 1,050 cubic meters per hour.

    Gao Guodong used to be an ordinary crew member and was also gradually promoted during the port's construction. He leads the two large ships, "Kuai Li" and "Jun Li," undertaking all the dredging tasks of the deep-water channel. There are 54 crew members on the "Kuai Li," living at sea for a long time. Generally, people "go to port" (go ashore for vacation) once a month, resting for four days. A small number of leaders "go to port" once every half month, staying at home for two days. The water they drink is sent from Tianjin by the "Shui Xing" barge. The coal they burn is sent by a coal barge. In addition, tugboats deliver newspapers, letters, and even rice, flour, oil, salt, vegetables, and other things to them every day.

    In the past, the crew members lived a monotonous life on the ocean, and the "nation" never cared about them; only after liberation did they, like the people on the mainland, fulfill their due obligations and enjoy the rights they should enjoy. The day I arrived on the ship happened to be the day they re-elected the members of the ship's (equivalent to a factory workshop) management committee. And it was done by ballot. When the ballots were collected together for counting and tallying, they forgot to elect a ballot supervisor, and people immediately raised objections: "Wait, elect a ballot supervisor before tallying the votes!" The ballot supervisor was elected, the votes were tallied, and the new committee members were elected. More than fifty people applauded enthusiastically, and the meeting adjourned. At this time, I grabbed the young man who had just tallied the votes and asked him what kind of cadre he was! He said that he was originally responsible for statistical work. However, "a few days ago, I was 'countered off' during the anti-'five excesses' campaign. Now I haven't been assigned work yet!" The statistical work he mentioned refers to the statistics of various movements. On this ship of fifty-odd people, it is, of course, unnecessary. From his humorous answer, we can see that the people at sea are indeed beating with the pulse of the motherland's mainland, breathing with the breath of the motherland's mainland.

    That evening, the sunset reddened the azure sea, and the bright and dazzling red light reflected on everyone's faces. The crew members, tired after a day's work, rested according to their own pleasures. On the deck, three young people were playing checkers. Two old men were silently playing Chinese chess. From the mud hold, came the melodious sounds of the huqin and the long鸣 of the suona. People who loved peace and quiet, with their hands behind their backs, strolled on the deck, gazing at the vast ocean and sky. Only the three cadres of the Youth League branch sat on the high ship's top, discussing the work plan for the next month. Li Jinsheng, the secretary of the Youth League branch, walked towards me. I said: "This place is really like a floating village."

    "No!" He immediately corrected me: "This place is a city! There are electric lights, running water, radios, and even single rooms in the guest house!" That night, I stayed in the "single room guest house" in this drifting city.

    This guest house is really not simple, like a general city hotel. There is a desk lamp, a ceiling light, and a small electric fan.

    Early the next morning, walking out of the room, I opened my eyes and saw a bright red national flag, inserted on the high ship, fluttering on the azure sea. "What does this mean?" I asked puzzled.

   "Today is 'August 1st' Army Day!" – Indeed, they remember everything about the motherland so clearly, and feel it so intimately.

    I found Li Jinsheng, the secretary of the Youth League branch, and asked him to finish what he hadn't finished saying last night. Li Jinsheng spoke vividly, showing the optimism unique to young people in every way. When it came to work, he was so serious and solemn. The Youth League members under his leadership all possess a steel-like resilience, which is essential for working at sea. Li Jinsheng said: "This year, the weather is particularly hot. A few days ago—that is, those two days of the dog days—it was unbearably hot on the ship. The workers were so hot that they couldn't sleep or eat. Some slept only one or two hours a day and night, and some ate only half a small bowl of rice in two days. However, the sun kept baking us to death, and the boiler kept roasting us to death. The temperature in the boiler room was as high as 130 degrees. Ordinary people would faint as soon as they entered the room. The young people who fired the boiler, in teams of two, had to fill and send more than 3,000 kilograms of coal every hour. The work was tense and tiring. According to the labor protection regulations, work could have been completely stopped. At this time, the administration sent heatstroke prevention medicine from Tianjin, cooked mung bean soup, and also built cool shelters on the deck. They also thought about changing this situation from the perspective of machinery and equipment, but it was not possible under the current conditions. So we held a Youth League meeting to let the members discuss what to do. The members said: 'Labor protection regulations are the state's concern for us. How should we treat the state's tasks? If we stop firing the boiler, the dredger will be like a dead person and can't do anything. Besides, stopping the ship for one day is equivalent to a loss of 20 million yuan.' The young people continued: 'Since we are glorious Youth League members, we should be able to withstand the test and must not put the state's tasks aside.' So, they walked into the fire-roasted boiler room, picked up the big iron shovel weighing more than 30 kilograms, and filled and sent 3,000 kilograms of coal per hour as usual. On this day, Comrade Li Yuhai got sick from the heat, but he resolutely refused to 'go to port.' Also on this day, a stoker fainted. Youth League member Li Fuhai ran over, took the big iron shovel and said: 'I'll take your shift.' He started working. Not long after, another worker fainted. Cao Jinshan, the leader of the Youth League group, had just finished his own 'small shift' (four hours) and should have rested. But he silently took the shovel of the person who fainted and worked for another two hours… On this day, three workers fainted one after another, but their work was replaced by Youth League members, and the boiler's steam pressure always maintained its saturation point, and dredging work continued as usual." Li Jinsheng wiped his forehead. His experience of the heat was obviously profound.

    I savored Li Jinsheng's words, thinking of those young people. They are truly like what is sung in a Soviet song: "Not afraid of burning in the fire, and will not sink in the water." With such strong and brave young people, what difficulties and hardships cannot be overcome! At this time, I saw an old man with white hair walking towards me. His name is Chen Gui, and he is the captain of the "Kuai Li." He is already sixty-two years old this year!

    "Aren't sailors supposed to retire and enjoy their retirement at the age of fifty-five! How could you..." I asked with concern.

    "The country needs me. There are few such talents at the moment. Besides, the more I can work, the more I can fulfill my obligations. This will not fail the country's concern." Chen Gui, like a commander who grasps the direction of navigation, is steady and calm. He said that among the captains of self-propelled dredgers, his age is not the oldest. The captain on the "Jun Li" is already over seventy years old. Now, those who lead this kind of dredging ship are generally fifty or sixty years old. The old captain expressed great heartache when talking about this situation: "What can be done! In the past, the port was in the hands of the imperialists. Old China did not train such talents for us. As soon as liberation came, construction here and construction there, where can we find so many captains at once? Besides, this kind of ship is neither like a ship sailing on the sea nor like other forms of dredgers. Without decades of maritime experience, it really can't be done." The old captain said that the country is very concerned about these old people. In addition to their basic salary, they also have pension allowances and maritime allowances. In order to take care of his blurred eyes, the country transferred him to a small boat on the inland rivers of Tianjin last year to recuperate and work. However, after the task of deepening the main channel of Tanggu New Port was put forward this year, the ship's leaders were not equipped with enough personnel, and he returned to the "Kuai Li." He walked to his bridge, widened his eyes, stared at the direction of navigation, and directed the helmsmen: "To the left...to the left... maintain normal." The old captain is very clear that the task assigned to him by the country is not mainly to work eight hours a day, but more importantly to teach apprentices and cultivate talents.

    Speaking of teaching apprentices, Chen Gui talked about his history and family life. He has lived at sea for forty-five years, and has been a captain since 1927. He has four sons, but he had long ago made up his mind: "I will never let young people do this line of work again." Experience told him: "People, no matter how good they are, will go bad once they get on a ship."

    It's no wonder Chen Gui, what he had seen and come into contact with in the past was that ships were a concentration point of darkness. The crew members were directly exploited and oppressed by the imperialists, and fooled and blinded by the reactionary ruling class. They lived a special life on the ocean, which also formed their special character. Many crew members, once they got on the ship, would gamble! And eat! Once they started gambling, they threw everything to the back of their heads, even hiring people to work their shifts: "Old Zhang, take my shift for me, I'll give you fifty cents." They themselves were living in a drunken stupor. Finally, one day they got ashore, they would prostitute! And drink! In the end, their wages were never enough. They were always in debt, and couldn't even afford their own food and clothing. What could they do? – At this time, they could only resort to smuggling, theft, fighting, swearing, and doing other unimaginable evils. The old society, the old society was like this! It turned so many pure and kind people into "bad people"! Sailors were once insulted by the reactionary ruling class as "savages divorced from human life." Because of these things, Chen Gui was determined not to let his children "do this line of work again." Because of these things, there were fewer and fewer people on the ship, resulting in the current situation where there is a lack of people in the younger generation.

    Now, Chen Gui has abandoned his determination not to let his children "do this line of work." He said that society has changed, people have changed, and young people have unlimited bright futures everywhere. Chen Gui and the other old people I met all strongly encouraged young people to get on the ship, and especially welcomed "knowledgeable" young people to get on the ship. They said: We are all illiterate people, groping for decades. If they were college students who graduated from navigation schools, they could learn it in a few years.

    That noon, the four old men on the ship had lunch with me. On the outdoor deck's dining table, there were four large plates of dishes, one of which was flounder, and another was "eight-band fish" that I had never seen or eaten before. The old men ate and greeted me: "Eat! It's rare for you to eat such fresh fish." "This was just caught from the sea." "Eight-band fish, you can't even buy it outside." Saying that, the old man put a large piece of fish into my bowl. ... I had a pleasant conversation with the four old men, and the more we talked, the more I felt they were kind and amiable. The old men talked about the suffering of the past, saying: "Three days and three nights would not be enough to finish talking about it." Speaking of the future, they had even greater interest. The old men always liked to say "changed." Changed, indeed everything has changed, society has changed, and people have changed. Some clusters of green, strong willows and fragrant locust trees have already grown in the past silty areas. Cheerful songs are broadcast on the docks all day long. Even at night, electric lights and searchlights illuminate the port area brightly. … As for the future, the future Tanggu New Port is the "great northern port" that the Chinese people have dreamed of for many years, and it is also a beautiful and gorgeous garden at the gate of the motherland.

                  August 1953, at Tanggu New Port
                                        (The End)

    在塘沽新港（续）
    本报记者　林里
    漂荡的城
    站在塘沽新港码头上，仔细观察港区的水面，你会发现：有一道碧绿的清流，它像一条线，把大海划成了两半。这条清流，就是人工挖成的主航道。一共有十五点二公里长，六十公尺宽，深达零下七公尺，涨潮期间，会有十公尺左右的大水。有了这条主航道，吃水二十七英尺的轮船，就可以直驶新港码头靠岸。
    主航道主要是由自航式挖泥船挖成的。
    一天上午，我坐海上测量人员的拖轮，离开陆地，到了自航式“快利”号挖泥船上。这种船的构造和动作，许多地方与吸扬式挖泥船相反。自航式挖泥船上有个大肚子，叫泥舱。屁股底下拖着个铁“耙子”。工作时，“耙子”往海底一放，淤泥就涮拉涮拉地滚进泥舱。然后，它带着这满肚子的淤泥，自己航行（其他式的船要拖轮拖带）到主航道外面的大海里，把泥倒在那里，再轻飘飘地返回来，进行下一次的挖泥。“快利”号在三大自航式挖泥船当中，是最小的一个。但它一次就可挖走五百立方公尺淤泥。船上的负责人高国栋同志向我介绍说：去年，这只船每挖一舱泥要三十—三十二分钟的时间，今年，只要二十一—二十四分钟的时间就够了。可是去年，它和它的姊妹船—“浚利”号，就完成了相当于以前五年工作量的总和。尽管有了这么大的成就，船员们却并不满足。今年，按着新的定额，“快利”号每小时挖泥九百立方公尺。可是船员们早就突破了这个数字，每小时的挖泥量达到一千零五十立方公尺了。
    高国栋以前是个普通船员，也是建港中逐步提拔起来的。他领导着“快利”和“浚利”两只大船，担负着深水航道的全部挖泥任务。“快利”船上有五十四名船员，长期生活在海上。一般人每月“走港”（登陆休假）一次，休息四天，少数领导人员每半月，“走港”一次，在家住两天。他们吃的水，是由“水星”号驳船从天津送来的。烧的煤，是由煤驳送来的。另外，有拖轮每天给他们送书报、信件，以至米、面、油、盐、菜蔬一类的东西。
    过去，船员们过着海洋上的单调生活，“国家”从不关心他们；只是解放以后，他们才和大陆上的人们一样：尽他们应尽的义务，享受他们应当享受的权利。我到船上的这天，正好赶上他们改选船舶
  （相当于工厂的车间）管理委员会的委员。而且是用票选。当选票集中在一起，进行统计、唱票的时候，忘了选举监票人，人们立刻提出了意见：“等等，选个监票人再唱票！”监票人选举出来了，票数统计好了，新的委员产生了。五十多个人热情地鼓着掌，散会了。这时，我抓住刚才那位统计票数的青年，问他是什么干部！他说他本来负责统计工作。不过，“头几天反‘五多’，把我反掉了。现在还没有分配工作哩！”他所说的统计工作，是指各项运动的统计。在这五十几个人的船上。当然是不必要的。从他那滑稽的回答里，我们可以看到：海上的人，的确是随着祖国大陆上的脉搏跳动而跳动，随着祖国大陆上的呼吸而呼吸。
    这天傍晚，晚霞映红了蔚蓝色的海面，灿烂辉煌的红光，反射到每一个人的脸上。船员们劳累了一天，各自按着各自的乐趣休息了。甲板上，三个年轻人在下跳棋。两个老人，一声不响地走象棋。泥舱那面，传来了悦耳的胡琴声和哨呐的长鸣。爱静的人们，背起了他们的双手，漫步在甲板上，眺望着辽阔的海洋和天空。只有青年团支部的三个干部，坐到高高的船顶上，讨论着下月份的工作计划。青年团支部书记李金声向我走来。我说：“这儿真像一个水上乡村。”
    “不！”他立时纠正说：“这儿是一座城市呢？有电灯、自来水，有收音机，还有单间招待所哩！”这天晚上，我就在这漂荡的城中，住了“单间招待所”。
    这个招待所可真不简单，像一般城市的旅馆。有台灯、有顶灯，还有一个小小的电扇。
    第二天一早，走出房间，睁眼一看，一面鲜红的国旗，插在高高的船上，飘在蔚蓝色的海上。“这是什么意思？”我纳闷地问着。
   “今天是‘八一’建军节呵！”——真是，祖国的一切，他们记得是这样清楚，感觉是这样亲切。
    我找到青年团支部书记李金声，请他说完昨天晚上没有说完的话。李金声说话有声有色，处处显示着年轻人所特有的乐观情绪。一谈到工作，又是那样认真、严肃。他领导下的青年团员，个个具有钢铁般的坚强性格，这是海上工作所必备的。李金声说：“今年天气特别热，头两天——就是暑伏的那两天，船上热得简直受不了。工人们热得睡不着觉，吃不下饭。有的一天一夜只睡一、两个小时，有的两天只吃了半小碗饭。可是，太阳一直在死晒，锅炉一直在死烤，锅炉房里的气温高达一百三十度，平常人一进屋就晕倒。在锅炉房烧火的年轻人，两个人一班，每小时要填送三千多斤煤，工作又紧张、又劳累。按着劳保条例的规定，已经完全可以停止工作了。这时，行政上从天津送来了避暑药，熬了绿豆汤，还在甲板上搭了凉篷。也曾想过从机器设备上改变这种情况，可是在目前条件又不可能，于是我们开了个青年团的会，让团员们讨论怎么办？团员们说：‘劳保条例是国家对我们的关心。我们如何对待国家任务呢？要是我们一停止烧火，挖泥船就像人死了一样，什么也不能干了。再说，船停一天，就等于少收入两千万元。’年轻人们接着说：‘我们既然是光荣的青年团员，就应该经得起考验，就决不能把国家任务放在一边。’于是，他们走进火烤着的锅炉间，拿起那把三十多斤重的大铁锹，照样每小时填送三千多斤煤。就在这天，李玉海同志热病了，但他坚决不‘走港’。也在这一天，一个烧火工人昏倒了，青年团员李福海跑过去，接过那个大铁锹说：‘我替你上港。’干开了。不多时，又一个工人昏倒了。团的小组长曹金山，本来刚刚干完了自己的一个‘小班’（四小时），应该休息了。但他不声不响地接过昏倒者的铁锹，又干了两小时……这一天，一连有三个工人昏倒，但他们的工作，都由青年团员代替了，锅炉的汽压始终保持着它的饱和点，挖泥工作照常进行着。”李金声抹了抹他的前额，他对于热的体会显然是深刻的。
    我回味着李金声的谈话，想着那些年轻人，他们，真像一首苏联歌曲里所唱的：“在火里不怕燃烧，水里亦不会下沉。”祖国有了这么坚强勇敢的年轻人，还有什么艰难困苦不可克服哩！这时候，我眼前走来一位白发苍苍的老人，他叫陈贵，是“快利”号的船长。今年已经六十二岁了！
    “海员不是五十五岁就可以退休养老吗！你怎么……”我关切地问着。
   “国家需要。眼前这种人材又少。再说，能多干一天，就多尽一点义务。这也就不辜负国家的关心了。”陈贵，像一般掌握航行方向的指挥者一样，稳重，又沉着。他说在自航式挖泥船的船长当中，他的年纪还不是最大的。“浚利”号上的船长已经七十多岁了。现在领导这种船挖泥的，一般都是五、六十岁的人。老船长说到这种情况，表示十分痛心：“有什么办法哩！过去港口掌握在帝国主义手里，旧中国没有给我们培养这号人材，一解放，这里建设，那里建设，一下去那里找这末多船长呢？再说，这种船，既不像航行在大海的船，又不像其他形式的挖泥船，没有几十年的海上经验，实在干不了。”老船长说国家对他们这批老人十分关心，他们除了基本工资外，还有养老津贴和海上津贴。国家为了照顾他那昏花的眼睛，去年把他调到天津内河的小船上，一面休养，一面工作。可是，今年提出加深塘沽新港的主航道的任务以后，船上的领导人配备不开，他又重新回到“快利”号上。他走上他的驾驶台，睁大眼睛盯视着航行的方向，指挥着舵手们：“向左……向左……保持正常。”老船长很清楚，国家交给他的任务，主要不是每天工作八点钟，更重要的是教徒弟，培养人材。
    说到教徒弟，陈贵谈起了他的历史和家常。他在海上生活了四十五年，从一九二七年就当船长。他有四个儿子，可是他早就下决心说：“决不让年轻人再干这一行。”经验告诉他：“人，天好的人，一到船上就坏了。”
    这也难怪陈贵，他过去所看到的和接触到的，船上是黑暗的集中点。船员们受着帝国主义的直接剥削和压迫，受着反动统治阶级的愚弄和蒙蔽。他们过着海洋上的特殊生活，也就形成了他们的特殊性格。许多船员上了船，就赌呵！吃呵！一赌起来，什么都丢到了脖子后边，甚而花钱雇人值班：
  “老张，替我上一港，给你五毛。”自己却在醉生梦死。好容易有一天上了岸，他们就嫖呵！喝呵！到头来，工资总是不够。总是欠着债，甚至连自己的吃穿都弄不上。怎么办呢？——这时候就只有走私、偷盗、打架、骂街，以及干出其他人所想像不到的恶行。旧社会，旧社会就是这样啊！它把多少纯洁、善良的人们都糟踏成了“坏人”！海员，就曾被反动统治阶级侮辱为“脱离人生的野人”。就是因为这些，陈贵决心不让孩子们“再干这一行”。就是因为这些，船上的人员越来越少，以致形成今天这种青黄不接的局面。
    现在，陈贵已经放弃了不让孩子“干这一行”的决心。他说，社会变了，人也变了，年轻人到那里都有无限光明的前途。陈贵和我见过的其他几位老人，都极力鼓励年轻人上船，还特别欢迎“有知识的”青年上船。他们说：我们这些人都是一个大字不识，摸索了几十年，要是航海学校毕业的大学生，或者几年就可以学成。
    这天中午，船上的四位老人和我一起共进午餐。露天甲板的餐桌上，放着四大盘菜，其中有一个是比目鱼，有一个是我从来没有见过、也没有吃过的“八带鱼”。老人们一边吃，一边招呼我：“吃吧！你是很难吃到这么新鲜的鱼的。”“这是刚刚从海里捉起来的。”“八带鱼，外面买都买不到的。”说着，老人把一块大鱼放到我的碗里。……我和四位老人畅谈，越谈越感到他们善良可亲。老人们谈到过去的痛苦，说：“三天三夜也说不完。”说到未来，他们却有着更大的兴趣。老人们总喜欢说“变了”。变了，的确一切都变了，社会变了，人也变了。过去的淤泥地带，已经长出一些丛绿、茁壮的杨柳和香槐，码头上成天放送着愉快的歌曲，就是夜晚，电灯和探照灯，把港区照得通亮明。……至于将来，将来的塘沽新港是我国人民多年来梦寐以求的“北方大港”，也是祖国门口的一座美丽漂亮的花园。
                  一九五三年八月在塘沽新港
