Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th (TASS): "Pravda" commentator Mikhailov commented on the statement made by Indonesian Foreign Minister Sunarjo at a press conference in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, on the 7th, saying that, on the whole, this statement is very important because it demonstrates the foreign policy of the new Indonesian government.

Speaking about the current urgent tasks of his new government, Sunarjo summarized these tasks into six points. According to his statement, the Indonesian government intends to: First, revise the Dutch-Indonesian agreement. Sunarjo pointed out that Indonesia will continue to insist on the incorporation of West Irian, which is still under Dutch control, and to abolish the agreement on the Dutch-Indonesian Union, which was imposed on Indonesia at that time, in the nearest possible future.

Second, Indonesia intends to begin negotiations with Japan on the conclusion of a bilateral agreement that will replace the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which was signed by Indonesian representatives but not ratified by parliament. Indonesia insists that Japan pay war reparations.

Sunarjo said that, third, although the Indonesian government is willing to accept foreign aid and investment, it insists that they must not infringe upon Indonesian sovereignty or impose unacceptable economic or political obligations on Indonesia.

The other three points of Sunarjo's statement mentioned Indonesia's relations with some countries. He said that his government will establish diplomatic missions in Moscow before the end of this year, and the first Indonesian ambassador to the People's Republic of China will soon leave for Beijing. Indonesia also intends to develop mutual relations with Asian and African countries.

Mikhailov concluded that all of this shows that the Indonesian government intends to expand and develop its international relations.

    评论印尼新政府的外交政策
   【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：“真理报”评论员米哈伊洛夫评论印尼外交部部长苏纳约于七日在菲律宾首都马尼拉举行的记者招待会上的声明说，整个讲来，这个声明很重要，因为它表明了印尼新政府的外交政策。
    苏纳约在谈到他的新政府当前的首急工作时，把这些工作归纳为六点。按照他的声明，印尼政府打算：第一，修改荷兰—印尼协定。苏纳约指出，印尼将继续坚持要归并现在仍在荷兰控制下的西伊里安，并在可能的最近的将来废除当时强加于印尼的关于荷兰—印尼联合王国的协定。
    第二，印尼打算和日本开始进行关于缔结双边协定的谈判，这个协定将代替曾由印尼代表签字但未经议会批准的旧金山和约。印尼坚持日本要支付战争赔偿。
    苏纳约说，第三，印尼政府虽然愿意接受外国援助和投资，但是坚持它们不得侵犯印尼主权，不得给印尼强加上不能接受的经济或政治义务。
    苏纳约的声明的其他三点提到了印尼和一些国家的关系。他说，在今年年底以前，他的政府将在莫斯科设立外交代表机构，印尼驻中华人民共和国的第一任大使不久就要动身去北京。印尼并打算发展和亚洲及非洲国家的相互关系。
    米哈伊洛夫的结语说，所有这些都表明，印尼政府打算扩大和发展它的国际关系。
