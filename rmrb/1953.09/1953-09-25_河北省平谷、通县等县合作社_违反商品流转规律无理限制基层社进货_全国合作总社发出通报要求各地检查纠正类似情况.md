Representatives of more than thirty primary-level cooperatives from Tongxian Special District, Hebei Province, who attended a business organization meeting of Beijing District cooperatives, reflected in a symposium: certain county cooperatives in Tongxian Special District violated the normal laws of commodity circulation and restricted the purchasing of goods by primary-level cooperatives. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives has issued a circular on this matter, requiring all localities to pay attention to inspecting and correcting similar phenomena.

According to the representatives of primary-level cooperatives in Tongxian Special District, some county cooperatives in the special district did not pay attention to reducing commodity circulation costs and unreasonably restricted purchases by primary-level cooperatives. For example, the joint cooperative of Pinggu County supplied brown sugar to primary-level cooperatives at 4,200 yuan per jin, and the primary-level cooperatives had to retail it at 4,600 yuan per jin, while local private merchants retailed brown sugar at 3,800 yuan per jin, making it impossible for the primary-level cooperatives to sell their brown sugar. However, the wholesale price of brown sugar at the county department store was only 2,900 yuan, and cooperatives received a 3% discount (although the type of sugar was different, the quality was not inferior). The Fifth District Cooperative of the county purchased directly from the department store, reducing the retail price to 3,600 yuan. After the county cooperative joint society found out, it prohibited the district cooperative from continuing to purchase from the department store and additionally deducted 1% of the handling fee. Another example is that the Second District Cooperative of Tongxian County ordered a batch of shoe upper cloth from small handicraft workers in Xianghe County at 80,000 yuan per bolt. The county cooperative said this was "running to private merchants" and had to be handled uniformly by the county cooperative; after unified management, the price per bolt increased to 100,100 yuan. The Doudian Primary-Level Cooperative in Liangxiang County purchased goods directly from the Tongxian Special District Cooperative Goods Station in Beijing, and the county cooperative even charged a 1% handling fee. The county cooperative stipulated that primary-level cooperatives must go through the county cooperative for introductions to purchase goods from state-owned companies, and the company would deduct 0.5% of the handling fee on behalf of the county cooperative. If the county cooperative had the goods, primary-level cooperatives had to purchase from the county cooperative even if the price was higher than that of the state-owned company, otherwise, they would not be given a letter of introduction. At the same time, the county cooperative had a contract with the state-owned company stating that if primary-level cooperatives did not bring a letter of introduction to buy goods from the state-owned company, the company would also deduct a handling fee on behalf of the county cooperative.

The circular from the All-China Federation of Cooperatives stated that the above-mentioned practices of the county cooperatives in Pinggu, Tongxian, Liangxiang, and other counties violated the normal laws of commodity circulation, artificially increased commodity costs, restricted the expansion of cooperative trade operations, thereby suppressing the initiative of primary-level cooperatives to operate independently, weakening their strength to fight against speculative merchants, and ultimately would inevitably detach them from the broad masses of cooperative members. Since the All-China Federation of Cooperatives instructed all localities to strengthen autumn supply operations, some regions have paid attention to correcting unreasonable practices such as "violating the normal laws of commodity circulation and excessively restricting primary-level cooperatives," but many regions have not earnestly implemented this spirit. The situation reflected by the representatives of primary-level cooperatives in Tongxian Special District also exists in some regions. Cooperatives in all localities should inspect and correct these unreasonable phenomena, help primary-level cooperatives improve their operating conditions, improve their relationship with county cooperatives, and thereby give play to their operating initiative.

### 河北省平谷、通县等县合作社  违反商品流转规律无理限制基层社进货  全国合作总社发出通报要求各地检查纠正类似情况

    河北省平谷、通县等县合作社
    违反商品流转规律无理限制基层社进货
    全国合作总社发出通报要求各地检查纠正类似情况
    河北省通县专区参加北京区合作社业务组织会议的三十多个基层合作社的代表，在一次座谈会上反映：通县专区某些县社违反商品正常流转规律，在进货方面对基层社加以限制。中华全国合作社联合总社为此发出通报，要求各地注意检查纠正类似现象。
    据通县专区基层合作社代表反映，该专区有的县社不注意减低商品流转费用，无理限制基层社进货。如平谷县合作社联合社供应基层社的红糖，每斤四千二百元，基层社零售每斤要四千六百元，当地私商零售红糖每斤三千八百元，基层社的红糖卖不出去。但县百货公司红糖批发价仅二千九百元，并且对合作社有九七折优待（虽然糖种不同，质量并不次）。该县五区合作社直接从百货公司进货，把零售价降低到三千六百元。县合作社联合社知道后，竟不准该区合作社继续从百货公司进货，并补抽了百分之一的手续费。又如通县二区合作社就近向香河县小手工业者订购了一批鞋面布，每匹八万元，县社说这是“跑私商”，要由县社统办；统办后每匹价格提高到十万零一百元。良乡县窦店基层社向北京的通县专区合作社货栈直接进货，县社竟要抽取百分之一的手续费。该县社规定：基层社由国营公司进货必须经过县社介绍，由公司代县社扣百分之零点五的手续费；凡是县社有的货，虽然价格比国营公司高，基层社也必须从县社进货，否则就不给开介绍信。同时该县社和国营公司订有合同，基层社不拿介绍信到国营公司买货，公司也代县社扣手续费。
    中华全国合作社联合总社的通报中称：平谷、通县、良乡等县社上述做法，违反商品正常流转规律，人为地增高了商品成本，限制了合作社贸易业务的扩展，从而压抑了基层社独立经营的积极性，削弱了它们和投机商人斗争的力量，最后必然会脱离广大社员群众。自从全国合作总社指示各地加强秋季供应业务以后，有些地区注意纠正了“违反商品正常流转规律，对基层社限制过严”等不合理的做法，但有不少地区还没有认真贯彻这一精神。通县专区基层合作社代表反映的情况，在某些地区也同样存在。各地合作社应检查纠正这类不合理的现象，帮助基层社改善经营条件，改善他们和县社的关系，从而发挥他们经营的积极性。
