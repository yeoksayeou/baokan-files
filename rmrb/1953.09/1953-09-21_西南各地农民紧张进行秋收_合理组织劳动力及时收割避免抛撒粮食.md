Peasants in Southwest China are tensely carrying out the autumn harvest. Currently, in many areas of Sichuan Province, the autumn harvest has ended or is nearing completion. In Guizhou Province, over 30 counties have begun harvesting, and parts of Xikang and Yunnan have also started.

This year, because party and government organs at all levels have strengthened their leadership over agricultural production and have tightly grasped the farming season, generally achieving timely rice transplanting, the ripening time of rice is more uniform compared to previous years. This means the autumn harvest requires a lot of labor. These new situations and characteristics have made this year's autumn harvest more tense and busy than in previous years. Therefore, reasonably allocating the labor force and solving the difficulties of insufficient farm tools and draft cattle has become the most important problem in the autumn harvest. All regions have attached importance to solving this problem.

When solving the labor problem, the main approach is to use the original mutual aid teams as a foundation, unite individual farmers to organize threshing groups, and some regions have also paid attention to mobilizing women to participate in the autumn harvest. In many areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces, while arranging the autumn harvest work, they also convened representative meetings of mutual aid team leaders at the special district, county, and township levels to solve some major problems within the mutual aid teams that hindered production and affected unity, such as the uncompensated use of farm tools, untimely settlement of work points, and unreasonable work arrangements. After these problems were resolved, the mutual aid teams were revitalized, further发挥ing their role in production. In addition, many regions have strengthened the leadership of temporary mutual aid teams, helping individual farmers to temporarily organize based on farmers' original habits of exchanging labor and mutual assistance. Changhe Township in Jingyan County, Sichuan Province, also particularly emphasized helping households with special difficulties solve autumn harvest problems. Some regions have also adopted the method of "exchanging labor in different places," mobilizing other townships and villages with later harvests or local mutual aid teams to provide support, ensuring timely harvesting.

Regarding farm tools and draft cattle, most regions have combined the publicity and implementation of agricultural production policies to address some remaining historical issues, correct deviations such as the uncompensated use of farm tools and excessively low wages for cattle labor, wage arrears, and poor feeding management, further implementing the principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit, eliminating some farmers' ideological concerns, and appropriately adjusting draft cattle and farm tools.

While solving various difficult problems for farmers, the relevant departments such as cooperatives and banks in most regions have made certain efforts. Many cooperatives in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces have specifically studied how to cooperate with the autumn harvest to expand purchasing and marketing work. Pu'er and other counties in Yunnan Province also convened representative meetings of iron, wood, and bamboo handicraft industries, mobilizing them to serve the autumn harvest. Cooperatives in Suiyang, Xingyi, Lushan and other counties in Guizhou Province prepared more than 21,000 pieces of large and small autumn harvest farm tools such as drying mats, windmills, and sickles in July, and supplied them to farmers in large quantities. The People's Bank of Jingyan County in Sichuan Province promptly issued third-quarter loans and organized farmers to buy back more than 100 head of draft cattle, solving the difficulty of insufficient draft cattle. In addition, some health departments in some regions have also actively organized local medical workers to go to the countryside to treat farmers, which has played a certain role in ensuring farmers' health and smooth completion of the autumn harvest.

All regions have also made great achievements in leading farmers to fight against natural disasters and in providing technical guidance. Some areas such as Hubei County and Jingyan County in Sichuan Province suffered from rainstorms during the autumn harvest process, and the local party and government leading organs immediately actively led the farmers to rush to harvest. Various regions in Yunnan Province launched a drought-resistance and autumn-protection campaign while preparing for the autumn harvest. Farmers in mountainous areas also actively hunted wild animals to protect crops. Many regions have educated farmers to improve threshing techniques, reducing the loss of grain scattering during threshing.

Judging from the situation in various regions, the main problems that still exist are: some cooperatives in some areas have underestimated the needs of farmers for means of production and means of livelihood during the autumn harvest, resulting in smaller supply plans that cannot meet the needs of farmers; the publicity and implementation of production policies in some areas are still very poor, and the production enthusiasm of some farmers is not stable enough; in areas where the autumn harvest has ended, some labor models and mutual aid teams have not completed the original production increase plans, resulting in negative emotions among some cadres and farmers, ignoring or denying the achievements of this year's comprehensive production increase. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the leadership of autumn production work, solve existing problems, so as to better complete the tasks of autumn harvest, autumn cultivation, and autumn sowing.

    西南各地农民紧张进行秋收
    合理组织劳动力及时收割避免抛撒粮食
    西南各地农民正紧张地进行秋收工作。目前，四川省不少地区秋收已经结束或接近结束，贵州省三十余县开始收割，西康、云南部分地区也已开始。
    今年因为各地党政机关加强了对农业生产的领导，抓紧了农事季节，一般做到按时插秧，因此，水稻成熟时间比较往年整齐一致，秋收时需要劳动力很多。这些新的情况和特点，使今年秋收比往年更加紧张繁忙。所以合理调配劳动力，解决农具、耕牛不足的困难，成了秋收中最主要的问题。各地都重视了对这一问题的解决。在解决劳动力问题时，主要是以原有互助组为基础，团结单干农民组织挞斗，有的地区并注意了发动妇女参加秋收。四川、贵州、西康等省不少地区在布置秋收工作同时，召开了专区、县、乡的互助组组长代表会议等，解决了互助组内有碍生产和影响团结的一些主要问题，如无偿使用农具、清工结账不及时、排工不合理等；这些问题得到解决后，使互助组都活跃起来，进一步发挥了在生产中的作用。另外，不少地区还加强了对临时性互助组的领导，根据农民原有的换工、互助习惯，帮助单干农民临时组织起来。四川省井研县长河乡并特别重视了帮助特殊困难户解决秋收困难。有的地区还采取了“异地换工”的办法，动员其他收割较迟的乡、村或本地的互助组进行支援，保证了按时收割。农具、耕牛方面，多数地区都结合宣传贯彻农业生产政策，处理了过去若干遗留问题，纠正了无偿使用农具和牛工工资太低、拖欠工资、饲养管理不善等偏向，进一步贯彻等价互利的原则，消除了某些农民的思想顾虑，并适当对耕牛、农具进行了调剂。
    在解决农民各项困难问题时，大部分地区的合作社、银行等有关部门都作了一定的努力。四川、云南、贵州、西康等省的许多合作社专门研究如何配合秋收展开购销工作。云南省普洱等县并召开了铁、木、篾等手工业代表会，发动他们为秋收服务。贵州省绥阳、兴义、炉山等县合作社，早在七月内就准备了合乎当地规格的晒席、风车、镰刀等大小秋收农具共二万一千余件，大量供应农民。四川省井研县人民银行及时发放了第三季度贷款，并组织农民买回耕牛一百多头，解决了耕牛不足的困难。此外，有些地区的卫生部门，还积极组织当地医务工作者下乡为农民治病，对保证农民身体健康，顺利完成秋收起了一定的作用。
    各地在领导农民和自然灾害作斗争以及技术指导方面，也有很大成绩。四川省沪县、井研等部分地区秋收过程中遭受暴风雨袭击，当地党、政领导机关即积极领导农民进行抢收。云南省各地在准备秋收同时，展开了抗旱保秋运动。山区的农民也积极捕打野兽，保护庄稼。不少地区教育农民改进挞谷技术，减少了挞谷时抛撒谷子的损失。
    从各地情况来看，目前还存在的主要问题是：部分地区合作社由于对农民秋收中生产资料和生活资料的需要估计不足，以致供应计划偏小，不能满足农民的需要；有些地区宣传贯彻生产政策仍然作得很差，部分农民的生产情绪不够稳定；秋收已经结束的地区，因为某些劳动模范、互助组没有完成原订的增产计划，在一些干部和农民中产生了消极情绪，忽视或否定了今年全面增产的成绩。因此，今后必须继续加强对秋季生产工作的领导，解决存在的问题，以便更好地完成秋收、秋耕、秋种任务。
