Improve Harvesting and Threshing Methods to Increase Rice Yield
Xiangtan County Proposes Specific Measures to Prevent Rice Lodging and Germination
Reader Yi Yang writes: In Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, during the mid-season rice harvest, rice fields in the 14th and 15th districts generally experienced lodging and germination due to wind and rain. In order to ensure a bumper harvest of mid-season rice, the Xiangtan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Xiangtan County People's Government have instructed all districts to make the prevention of rice lodging and germination and the rushing of harvest the overriding central task at present. They have also designated the district party committee secretaries or district heads to personally lead this work, actively mobilizing farmers to organize temporary mutual assistance to solve the difficulties of lacking manpower and tools in the rush harvest. The county has also promoted some specific measures to prevent rice lodging and germination based on local conditions: for immature lodged rice, the masses should be mobilized to rescue it by opening drainage ditches; in areas with excessively dense seedlings, a rice row can be cut open first, and then drainage ditches can be opened; for mature lodged rice, the masses should be mobilized to harvest it in the rain; for nearly mature lodged rice, farmers should be persuaded to harvest it as early and as quickly as possible. As for the harvested seedlings that cannot be threshed in time, farmers should be mobilized to build sheds in ventilated places to dry the seedlings; the threshed grains should be dried with a blower first, and then spread out to dry indoors (the floor inside the house must be scalded with lime first); in addition, the masses should be organized to prepare wood, grass ash, and cow dung in advance, so that they can promptly level the ground and rush to dry the grains when the weather clears.
The county also plans to convene old farmers' meetings in various townships to summarize their past successful experiences in preventing rice lodging and germination, so as to use local materials and promote them locally; during the promotion process, old farmers will be organized to provide technical guidance by division of labor and area.

Lingling County Farmers Organize to Harvest Mid-Season Rice
Yang Dejia and Gao Wei of the Office of the Lingling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan write: Our county began harvesting mid-season rice in mid-August. In order to help farmers solve the difficulties of insufficient labor and tools, and to achieve timely harvesting to prevent rice lodging and germination, cadres at all levels have actively inspired and guided the masses of farmers to organize themselves on the basis of their original exchange work habits, and have tried to solve the problem of work prices in some original mutual aid groups being lower than the market price. Therefore, farmers throughout the county have universally organized temporary mutual aid groups to rush harvest.
After the establishment of mutual aid groups in various places, they all put forward the slogan of "Quick harvest, quick threshing, quick drying, quick storage"; and after discussion, they implemented reasonable work arrangements, deciding to harvest the mature rice first, the rice in fields that have lodged first, and the rice in fields that have lodged and have water first. The groups in Taojiang Township, 12th District, took advantage of the moonlight at night to rush harvest overnight. The 26 groups in Beichong Township rushed to harvest 370 mu of rice paddies in three days. There were 300 mu of fields in Hejia Township that lacked water, and the rice would lodge as soon as the sun shone. If they were not harvested in time, the grains would fall into the field and germinate. After the masses in the township organized themselves, they first rushed to harvest the rice in these fields. In Yangtang Township, the Tang Mao Wu mutual aid group in the urban area initially wanted to harvest first. After discussion, they implemented reasonable work arrangements and divided the entire group into three threshing teams based on the *bantu* (a traditional farming tool) unit. Each *bantu* was equipped with people for threshing, carrying *bantu*, harvesting rice, and carrying grain. This division of labor greatly improved threshing efficiency.
At the same time, the mutual aid groups also helped the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and widowed and lonely households who lacked labor to rush harvest, and paid attention to frugality, overcoming the past phenomenon of heavy eating and drinking during the autumn harvest. Because organizing to harvest in a timely manner and saving expenses showed the superiority of the mutual aid groups, many single-farming farmers who were originally unwilling to participate in the mutual aid groups also actively organized themselves. For example, Jiang Guoyi, a farmer in Caijia Township, 4th District, initially only harvested two mu by himself in four days. Later, after he connected with Jiang Jianxing and other six households to organize a temporary mutual aid group, ten laborers harvested 33.7 mu in four days. This greatly promoted the progress of the autumn harvest work in our county.

Do Not Solely Seek Speed When Threshing; Pay Attention to Avoiding Scattering Grains
Reader Jiang Guohua from Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, writes: Recently, Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, is harvesting rice. Some places have been found to not pay attention to harvesting and threshing methods, resulting in serious waste of scattered grains. For example, in the eight townships of Yuwu, Liansheng, Zhubiao, etc., which had earlier harvest seasons in the county, due to the lack of labor during the harvest season, farmers from neighboring Fenggao and other townships with later harvest seasons were invited to help with the autumn harvest. According to the old rules: four people work together at one threshing tool, threshing twelve loads a day, and get a *dou* (a unit of measurement for grain) of rice as wages; more threshing means more wages, and less threshing means less wages. Because of the strong winds and heavy rains at the end of July, the rice generally lodged, making it difficult to thresh, averaging only nine loads a day. Some farmers who came to help with the work rushed to work regardless of everything in order to earn more wages. For example, four farmers from Fenggao Township helped Zhou Jiugao's family in Taiping Village, Yuwu Township, to thresh rice, and they rushed to thresh even when it was dark and there was no moonlight, resulting in the scattering of more than seventy *jin* (a unit of weight) of grain from twelve loads of fields. This situation of only seeking speed and not caring about scattering grains is common in the local area. Farmers in Jianshe Township also said when they went to other townships to help with threshing, "Harvesting in the rain, threshing in the rain, harvesting and playing." The above situation not only causes waste, but also affects the unity between farmers. Therefore, I suggest: on the one hand, local rural work cadres should educate farmers to be as serious and careful when helping others thresh rice as they are when threshing their own rice, and to "harvest well, thresh well, dry well, and store well," and not to simply emphasize speed, so as to avoid the loss of grain. On the other hand, the wages for threshing should not be simply calculated based on the number of loads of rice threshed, but should combine the quantity of threshing with the quality of threshing skills and the situation of grain scattering in the evaluation of work and scoring, so as to avoid the deviation of only seeking speed and not seeking quality.

    改进收割和脱粒方法，增加稻谷收获量
    湘潭县提出防止稻禾倒伏发芽的具体办法
    读者易扬来信：湖南省湘潭县在中稻收割时期，因风雨为害，十四、十五两区稻田普遍发生倒禾发芽现象。中共湘潭县委员会和湘潭县人民政府为了保证中稻丰收，已指示各区把防止稻禾倒伏、出芽和抢割抢收作为当前压倒一切的中心工作，并指定各区区委书记或区长亲自领导这项工作，积极发动农民组织临时性的互助，以解决抢割抢收中缺乏人力和工具的困难。该县并根据当地实际情况推广了一些防止稻禾倒伏和发芽的具体办法：未成熟的倒禾应发动群众用开圳排水的方法来抢救，在禾苗过密的地方可先刹开一条禾弄子，然后开圳排水；已经成熟的倒禾应发动群众冒雨收割；接近成熟的倒禾应说服农民尽量早割快收。至于已经收割而来不及掼谷的禾苗，则应动员农民在通风处搭棚晾禾；已打下的谷子应先用风车扇干，然后摊晾在屋内（屋内地下须先以石灰烫过）；此外，还应组织群众先准备好木、草灰和牛粪等，以备天气放晴就能及时整坪抢晒。
    该县还准备分乡普遍召开老农会，总结他们过去防止稻禾倒伏和发芽的成功经验，以便就地取材、就地推广；在推广过程中，将组织老农分工分片作技术指导。
    零陵县农民组织起来收割中稻
    中共湖南零陵县委办公室杨德嘉、高维来信：我县自八月中旬起开始收割中稻。为了帮助农民解决劳力、工具不足的困难，做到及时收割，以防止稻子倒伏生芽，各级干部就在群众原有换工习惯的基础上，积极启发和引导农民群众组织起来，并设法解决了某些原有互助组内工价低于市价的问题。因此，全县农民普遍组织了临时互助组进行抢收。
    各地互助组组成后，都提出了“快收、快打、快晒、快藏”的口号；并经过讨论，实行了合理排工，决定先熟先割，稻子已倒伏的田先割，已倒伏的又以田中有水的先割。十二区桃江乡各组都趁着晚上有月亮时连夜抢收。北冲乡二十六个组三天内就抢收了三百七十亩水稻。贺家乡有三百亩田缺水，太阳一晒禾就倒下去了，如不及时收割，谷粒就会掉在田里生芽，该乡群众组织起来后首先就抢割了这些田里的稻子。城区杨塘乡唐茂五互助组开始大家都想先收，经过讨论后实行了合理排工，并以扮桶为单位把全组分成了三个打谷小组，每个扮桶都配备了打谷、背扮桶、割谷、挑谷的人。这样分工以后，大大提高了打谷效率。
    同时，互助组在收割中还帮助了没有劳力的烈军属和鳏寡孤独户进行抢收，并注意了节约，克服了过去秋收中的大吃大喝现象。由于组织起来收割及时并节省了开支，显示了互助组的优越性，很多原来不愿参加互助组的单干农民也积极组织起来了，如四区蔡家乡农民蒋国仪，开始自己一个人四天只割了二亩，后来他串连蒋建兴等六户组织起临时互助组后，十个劳动力四天就收割了三十三亩七分。这就大大地推动了我县秋收工作的进度。
    打谷时不要单纯求快  要注意避免抛撒谷粒
    四川省荣昌县读者蒋国华来信：近来四川荣昌县正在收割稻谷，有些地方发现有不注意收割、打谷的方法，因而产生了抛撒谷粒的严重浪费现象。如这个县收获季节较早的御侮、联升、珠桥等八个乡，由于收割期间缺乏劳动力，就请邻近收割较迟的峰高等乡的农民来帮助秋收。照老规矩：四人合一张掼斗，一天打十二挑，得工资一斗米；多打就多得工资，少打就少得工资。因为七月末刮了大风、下了大雨，谷子普遍倒伏，不好打，平均每天只能打九挑。有些来帮工的农民为了多得工资，就不顾一切地快赶。如峰高乡四个农民帮御侮乡太平村周九高家打谷，黑夜没有月亮也赶着打，结果十二挑田的谷子就抛撒了七十多斤。这种只图赶快、不顾抛撒谷子的情况在当地是普遍的。建设乡的农民在到外乡帮打谷子时还说：“雨割、雨打、连割带耍”。以上情况不仅造成浪费，而且还影响了农民之间的团结。因此，我建议：一方面，当地农村工作干部应该教育农民，帮助别人打谷时要像和自己打谷一样认真、仔细，做到“收好、打好、晒好、藏好”，不能单纯强调快，以免造成粮食的损失。另一方面，当地打谷的工资不应该单纯按所打谷子挑数来计算，而应该把打谷数量和打谷技术好坏、谷子抛撒情况结合起来评工计分，这样就可避免只图快不求精的偏向。
