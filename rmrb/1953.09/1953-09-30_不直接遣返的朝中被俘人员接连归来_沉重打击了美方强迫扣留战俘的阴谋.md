Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 28th. Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: Prior to the start of the explanation sessions, as many as sixty-five Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs were repatriated on the 27th; this event delivered yet another heavy blow to the U.S.'s fabricated lie that "POWs would rather commit suicide than return home." Just before they were repatriated—on September 25th—Brigadier General Hamblen, head of the UN Command's repatriation group, issued a statement saying: "Fifteen thousand POWs have declared that they are firmly opposed to repatriation."

Prior to the start of the explanation sessions, ninety-eight Korean and Chinese POWs had already returned, bearing shocking scars, wounds, and tattoos, proving that Clark's so-called "freedom of choice" for POWs was a complete deception. With the return of each POW labeled as "firmly opposed to repatriation," more and more evidence emerged to prove that the U.S. had been and still was using pure force and threats of force to classify Korean and Chinese POWs as "refusing repatriation" in order to prevent their repatriation.

This growing evidence proves that a statement made by Clark was a complete and utter lie. Clark said: "The United Nations Command will fully support the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in carrying out its responsibility to ensure that no force or threat of force is used to obstruct or coerce these persons to be repatriated; as stipulated in the Armistice Agreement, no violence or insult to their dignity or self-esteem shall be permitted in any way or for any purpose against the persons of prisoners of war."

These ninety-eight Korean and Chinese POWs returned on different days and in batches from different camps on Jeju Island and the South Korean mainland, but what they told neutral representatives, reporters from both sides, and Indian custodial troops upon arriving at Panmunjom was consistent on the following key points: 1. Shortly before and after the signing of the Armistice Agreement, Korean and Chinese POWs who expressed a desire to be repatriated were beaten and killed indiscriminately. Every returnee spoke of being beaten, abused, and tattooed for showing signs of wanting to be repatriated or being suspected of wanting to be repatriated. Everyone could name comrades who were killed for openly expressing a desire to be repatriated, as well as the locations and dates of their deaths. 2. Special agents instructed all non-directly repatriated Korean and Chinese POWs to disrupt the explanation sessions, to beat and kill Korean and Chinese representatives who came to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custody area to conduct explanation work. They threatened the POWs that if they expressed a desire to be repatriated, they would be immediately executed.

When many returnees rushed out of the ranks in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custody area in front of observers and reporters to express their desire for repatriation to the Indian troops, Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gang special agents beat them with sticks or brutally assaulted them. To escape the beatings by special agents, some people climbed over barbed wire at night before being able to express their desire for repatriation to the Indian custodial troops. Upon arrival at Panmunjom, many of the returnees had dark circles under their eyes and lacked the strength to walk or speak. Several people either fainted or needed to be supported to receive medical attention.

They risked beatings and death to return to their motherland, knowing that even after the start of the explanation sessions, the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gang special agents who ruled their camps would continue to use all means to prevent their repatriation. Despite having words tattooed on their arms, chests, and backs, they still returned. Why did the U.S. POW camp authorities order Kuomintang gang special agents to tattoo insulting slogans on the POWs' bodies? The Kuomintang Central News Agency made it clear in a telegram on September 24: "If they choose to return to the mainland, the anti-communist characters tattooed on their bodies are essentially a guarantee of certain death." Returnees said that special agents in the POW camps in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custody area are stepping up the tattooing of insulting slogans on POWs to prevent their repatriation. The special agents threatened them that if they refused to be tattooed, they would be executed.

Special agents had cut flesh from the POWs' bodies to intimidate them and deter them from demanding repatriation. A large proportion of the sixty-five Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel who returned on the 27th rolled up their shorts to show the swollen scars on their thighs; special agents had cut flesh from their thighs to threaten them and other POWs, telling them not to demand repatriation. One of them had been beaten unconscious, then had his ear cut off and his stomach slashed. He had a long, bluish-black, swollen scar on his stomach where it had been cut open. The shocking scars and tattoos on all sixty-five returnees definitively prove that the methods used by the U.S. military authorities to deceive the world into believing that the POWs "firmly opposed repatriation" were no less cruel and vicious than those of the Nazis.

The accounts of the repatriated Korean and Chinese POWs confirm that Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gang special agents, who committed these atrocities under the direction and protection of the U.S., control the camps in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custody area. Every POW who wishes to be repatriated is constantly under threat of force and murder. Special agents exert mental coercion on the POWs in the camps, forcing them to "attend classes" every morning, telling them to go to Taiwan. Kuomintang gang special agents force the POWs to discuss these "courses" every afternoon to prevent their repatriation.

POWs are not allowed to talk to each other in private without permission. They are forbidden to speak to the Indian custodial troops. These orders are enforced with wooden sticks. POWs are forced to mutually guarantee in groups of three to five, as well as in squads and platoons, that they will not demand repatriation. If one person in that group, squad, or platoon is repatriated, the rest will be punished. The punishment methods used by the special agents to threaten the POWs are to hang them on barbed wire to serve as a warning to those who want to be repatriated.

It is well known that after the POWs were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gang special agent organizations in the camps were preserved intact. Obvious evidence of their reign of terror can be seen in the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gang flags hanging in almost every tent. Only those Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gang special agent elements have freedom. They possess sticks, knives, and other concealed weapons, and are organized to obstruct repatriation. Wang Xu, a repatriated Chinese People's Volunteer Army POW, reported that in his former Camp No. 31, five Volunteer Army POWs were being monitored by special agents because they were suspected of wanting to be repatriated. A group of people were being punished with hard labor for similar reasons.

U.S. Brigadier General Hamblen admitted in a statement on September 25 that if they win the "psychological warfare" to prevent a large number of Korean and Chinese POWs from returning home, it would be a "victory" for Washington and the Pentagon. To achieve this "victory," they have resorted to murdering and maiming POWs, and are brewing large-scale plans to undermine and obstruct the explanation work of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army representatives, and to tear up the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" agreement.

However, the increasing number of non-directly repatriated Korean and Chinese POWs who have returned without explanation has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. plot. This is why Hamblen and his special agents are sparing no effort to obstruct the repatriation of Korean and Chinese POWs. But the ninety-eight Korean and Chinese POWs who have already returned have revealed that there are many more waiting to return, as long as they are truly given the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation. The U.S.'s attempt to obstruct their repatriation will only be condemned by the whole world.

### 不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员接连归来  沉重打击了美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋

    不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员接连归来
    沉重打击了美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋
    【新华社开城二十八日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：在解释工作开始以前，二十七日，有多达六十五人的一批中国人民志愿军被俘人员被遣返；这件事使美方散布的所谓“战俘宁愿自杀也不愿回家”的谎言又受到一次沉重的打击。就在他们被遣返以前不久——九月二十五日——联合国军司令部遣返组组长汉布伦准将还发表声明说：“一万五千名战俘已宣布他们坚决反对遣返。”
    在解释工作开始以前，已有九十八名朝中被俘人员回来，他们身上带着令人震惊的伤疤、伤口和刺上的字，这说明克拉克的所谓战俘有“选择的自由”的说法，完全是骗人的鬼话。随着每一个被称为“坚决反对遣返”的战俘的归来，有越来越多的证据足以证明美方曾经并且仍在使用纯粹的武力和以武力相威胁，把朝中被俘人员分类为“拒绝遣返”的战俘，以阻止他们的遣返。
    这种愈来愈多的证据证明克拉克说过的一段话是弥天大谎，克拉克说：“联合国军司令部将完全支持中立国遣返委员会执行它的责任，即保证不得对这些人使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠或强使他们遣返；正如停战协定所规定的，不得允许以任何方式或为任何目的对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊。”
    这九十八名朝中被俘人员是在不同的日子分批从济州岛和南朝鲜大陆上的不同的营场中回来的，但是他们一到达板门店以后就对中立国代表和双方记者以及印度看管军队所说的话，在以下几个主要之点上都是一致的：一、在停战协定签字前后不久，表示希望遣返的朝中被俘人员曾被横加殴打和杀害。每一个归来人员都说到自己因显露希望遣返的迹象和有希望遣返的嫌疑而受到殴打、虐待和刺字的情形。每一个人都可以说出因公开表示希望遣返而遭杀害的同伴的姓名，以及他们被杀害的地点和日期。二、特务们要所有不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员破坏解释工作，要他们殴打和杀害到中立国遣返委员会看管地区进行解释工作的朝中代表。他们威胁战俘说，战俘们如果表示希望遣返，就要立即被处死。
    许多归来人员在中立国遣返委员会看管地区当着观察员和记者的面冲出队伍来向印度军队表示要求遣返的时候，国民党和李承晚匪帮特务曾用棍子打他们或凶殴他们。为了躲避特务的殴打，有些人在晚间爬过铁丝网，然后才能向印度看管军队表示希望遣返的意愿。在归来人员到达板门店时，其中许多人眼上有黑圈，连走路或讲话的力气都没有，有几个人不是晕倒，就是需要人扶着走去进行医疗。
    他们冒着挨打和死亡的危险回到祖国来，他们知道，甚至在解释工作开始之后，统治着他们的营场的国民党和李承晚匪帮特务仍将使用一切手段阻止他们的遣返。尽管他们臂上、胸上和背上被刺了字，他们还是回来了。美方战俘营当局为甚么命令国民党匪帮特务在战俘身上刺侮辱性的口号呢？国民党中央社在九月二十四日的电讯中说得很清楚：“如果他们选择返回大陆一途，则他们身体上所刺的反共文字根本等于必死无疑的担保。”归来人员说，中立国看管地区的战俘营里的特务正在加紧在战俘身上刺侮辱性的口号，以阻止他们的遣返。特务们威胁他们说，如果他们拒绝刺字的话，他们就要被处死。
    特务们曾把战俘身上的肉割去，来威吓他们，使他们不敢要求回国。二十七日回来的六十五名中国人民志愿军人员中有一大部分人卷起短袴，给人看他们大腿上肿起的伤痕；特务们曾把他们大腿上的肉割去，以威胁他们和其他战俘，要他们不要求遣返。其中有一个人曾被毒打得失去知觉，接着被割掉耳朵，划破肚子。他的肚子上有一道很长的青黑色的肿起的伤痕，那是被刀子划破的。全部六十五个归来人员身上的惊人的伤痕和所刺的字肯定地证明：美国军事当局为了欺骗世界说战俘“坚决反对遣返”而采取的手段，其残酷和凶狠的程度比纳粹有过之而无不及。
    被遣返的朝中被俘人员叙述的情况证实：在美方指使和保护下犯下这些暴行的国民党和李承晚匪帮特务，控制着中立国遣返委员会看管地区的营场。每一个希望遣返的战俘经常受到武力和屠杀的威胁。特务们在营场里对战俘施以精神上的威逼，每天上午强迫他们“上课”，要他们到台湾去。国民党匪帮特务强迫战俘每天下午讨论这些“课程”，以阻止他们的遣返。
    战俘们在没有得到许可时不得私下互相交谈。他们被禁止跟印度看管军说话。这些命令是用木棍强制执行的。战俘被迫以三人到五人一组以及以班和排为单位互相连保，保证他们不要求遣返。如果那一组、一班或一排中有一个人被遣返，其余的人便要受处罚。特务们用来威胁战俘的处罚办法是把他们吊在铁丝网上，以儆诫希望遣返的人。
    大家都知道，在战俘们被移交中立国遣返委员会看管以后，营场里的国民党和李承晚匪帮特务组织一直原封不动地保存着。他们的恐怖的统治的明显证据可以从几乎每一个帐篷都悬挂着的国民党和李承晚匪帮的旗子中看出来。只有那些国民党和李承晚匪帮特务分子才有自由，他们持有棍子、刀子和其他暗藏的武器，并且被组织起来阻挠遣返。已被遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员王旭报告说，在他以前所在的第三十一号营场里，有五个志愿军被俘人员正被特务监视着，因为他们有要求遣返的嫌疑。有一班人为了类似的原因而被罚做苦工。
    美国准将汉布伦在九月二十五日的声明中承认：如果他们赢得阻止大批朝中战俘回家的“心理战”，那将是华盛顿和五角大楼的一个“胜利”。为了得到这个“胜利”，他们采取了屠杀战俘和残害战俘身心的手段，并在酝酿大规模的计划，来破坏和阻挠朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表的解释工作，和撕毁“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”协议。
    但是没有经过解释就已经回来的不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员的人数愈来愈多，使美方的阴谋受到沉重的打击。汉布伦和他的特务们之所以不惜采取一切手段来阻挠朝中被俘人员的遣返，原因就在这里。但是已经回来的九十八个朝中被俘人员已经透露，还有更多的人正在等着回来，只要真正给他们行使遣返权利的机会。美方企图阻挠他们的遣返的阴谋只会遭到全世界的斥责。
