Drawing on Wheat Procurement Experience to Improve Autumn Grain Procurement

This year, grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have attached great importance to wheat procurement work. According to statistics up to early August, cooperatives have already exceeded the annual wheat purchase plan by more than 102%. However, from a regional perspective, the completion of procurement tasks is very uneven. The Central South region exceeded the annual plan by 22%, and the East China region exceeded the annual plan by 20%; while the Southwest region only completed 53% of the annual plan, the North China region only completed 52% of the annual plan, and the Northwest region was the worst, only completing 19.6% of the annual plan.

The reasons for the uneven development of wheat procurement work in various regions, in addition to poor market management in some areas, price discrepancies, and impacts on procurement, are mainly due to the lack of sufficient understanding of the importance of wheat procurement among some grain departments and cooperative cadres. Some leading cadres in grain departments and cooperatives simply emphasize the large and difficult tasks assigned by higher authorities, but do not actively complete the tasks. Some areas have not correctly grasped the price policy, and there are tendencies of being "too strict rather than too loose" or fluctuating too much. Some areas have the idea of "emphasizing procurement and neglecting supply," resulting in insufficient material supply, which has fueled farmers' reluctance to sell. There are also some areas where cooperatives procure wheat not to facilitate farmers' sales, but to wait for customers to come, or even use coercive orders and registration quotas to procure, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. These shortcomings should be given high attention and corrected in the autumn grain procurement.

What experiences from this year's wheat procurement work can be used as a reference for autumn grain procurement work?

1.  Correctly implement the price policy of "superior grain, superior price, pricing according to quality" and the principle of "good and bad grains are all accepted." This is the key to safeguarding farmers' interests and encouraging farmers to sell grain. This year, in many regions, cooperatives and grain bureaus held forums for inspectors or organized short-term training courses before procurement to study grading and pricing policies and grading inspection techniques, improving their business and technical levels. Some cooperatives regularly organized inspectors' meetings during procurement to study the masses' opinions on grading, exchange experiences, unify standards, and improve inspection techniques. The Hebei Dingxian Special District Cooperative publicly displayed samples; the Huangtuo Joint Village Cooperative in Qingyuan County adopted democratic evaluation methods to avoid suppressing grades and prices, which was strongly supported by grain-selling farmers. The grain departments and cooperatives in various parts of Fujian Province organized inspection teams to go deep into grassroots units to help evaluate, encouraging farmers to sell grain enthusiastically, and the amount of grain purchased in June was more than ten and a half times that of May. Conversely, if some grain departments and cooperatives did not implement the spirit of "grading and pricing, accepting both good and bad grains," they could not complete the grain purchase task. For example, this year, due to wheat suffering from disease, insects, and hail in Qinglong County, Guizhou Province, the general flour yield was 30% to 50%, but the county grain bureau insisted that the wheat flour yield must be above 70% before it would be accepted. As a result, 80% of the market supply did not meet the standards, and the grain bureau did not purchase it, so private merchants lowered prices to snap it up. The Changji Acquisition Station in Xiayi County, Henan Province, sifted the wheat three times and inspected it seven times when receiving it. The farmers found it troublesome and sold it to private merchants.

2.  Actively open up sources of goods and do a good job in supplying materials. Experience in various places has proved that where material supply is timely and meets the needs of farmers, grain procurement work can be carried out smoothly; otherwise, procurement work will be affected. For example, when soybean cake was fully supplied in Chengguan Cooperative, Ningyang County, Shandong Province, it purchased about 70,000 jin of wheat per day. After soybean cake was out of stock, it could only purchase about 10,000 jin per day. The Lianhe Cooperative in Changwu County, Shaanxi Province, neglected to supply industrial products such as plows, fertilizers, alkali noodles, petroleum, and matches, which were urgently needed by farmers during wheat procurement, resulting in the basic stagnation of wheat procurement work in the county, with only 0.112% of the procurement task completed in July. In terms of supply methods, the Yanghe Liancun Cooperative in Yidu, Shandong, set up stalls at the acquisition points to display various goods and supply them on-site in the form of small commodity exhibitions. Cooperatives in Zhenping County, Henan Province, conducted in-depth investigations into the needs of farmers and supplied materials in a planned way. The goods were complete and met the needs of the masses, which were welcomed by the masses.

3.  Strengthen organizational leadership, improve grain purchasing technology, and improve service attitude. This year, most of the acquisition stations in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi and other regions were equipped with cool sheds and tea, and they treated farmers kindly. They actively helped the elderly, the young, and the weak farmers to carry grain, weigh it, and stack it. The masses said, the cooperative is our own home! Some cooperative acquisition points have also adopted a shift system, opening the scales at dawn and stopping the acquisition at sunset, so as to achieve the requirements of farmers for "quick sale, quick purchase, and quick return home." Some cooperatives in Anhui and Hebei have adopted flow-line operation methods, with clear division of labor and responsibilities, shortening the acquisition time, and basically achieving the requirements of farmers to "sell quickly, buy quickly, and go home quickly." Many cooperatives in various regions have changed the past grain purchasing methods of waiting for customers to come and guarding the counter. Where there are not many acquisition points and they are far apart, or during the busy farming season and not on market days, they have planned to organize mobile acquisition or deliver goods to the door, purchasing grain locally, while publicizing, acquiring, and supplying, which is very popular among the masses. For example, the acquisition volume of the mobile team in Chuntang Township, a suburb of Shanghai, is equivalent to three times the acquisition volume of a fixed station. In Xingtang, Wuji, Xingtai, Tangshan and other places in Hebei Province, after publicity and mobilization, collective wheat sales were carried out in a planned and organized manner on the basis of farmers' willingness. This method has also proved to be effective.

4.  Revise the grain purchase plan in a timely manner. This year, some regions have overestimated the disaster situation and underestimated the output because the wheat production situation was not accurately estimated, and the grain purchase plan was generally too small. Some grain purchasing units easily complete or exceed the plan, resulting in complacency and slackness. The Zhantang and Huaqiao Cooperatives in Taizhou County, Zhejiang Province, applied to the County Cooperative to stop the acquisition because the acquisition task was completed. The Yongchuan County Grain Bureau in Sichuan Province entrusted seven cooperatives to purchase grain. Because the task has been completed, only four cooperatives are continuing to purchase grain. These acquisition units do not understand that because they have formulated a plan that is too small, they cannot meet the needs of the country and the requirements of farmers for selling grain, and even cause dissatisfaction among farmers. Some grain purchasing units in some regions have summarized experience, analyzed the situation, and revised the plan in a timely manner after completing the plan, taking the initiative to solve the difficulties in capital, warehousing, transportation, etc. caused by exceeding the plan, and continuing to carry out the acquisition work. This approach is correct.

### 吸取收购小麦经验，做好秋粮收购工作

    吸取收购小麦经验，做好秋粮收购工作
    各地粮食部门和供销合作社，今年都很重视小麦收购工作。截至八月上旬统计，合作社已超额完成全年小麦代购计划的百分之一百零二强。但从地区上看，收购任务完成的情况是十分不平衡的。中南区超额完成全年计划百分之二十二，华东区超额完成全年计划百分之二十；而西南区只完成全年计划的百分之五十三，华北区只完成全年计划的百分之五十二，西北最差，只完成全年计划的百分之十九点六。
    各地购麦工作发展不平衡的原因，除某些地区对市场管理不善、牌市价脱节、影响收购外，主要在于有些粮食部门和合作社干部对收购小麦的重要意义缺乏足够的认识。有的粮食部门和合作社的领导干部，单纯强调上级布置的任务大、困难多，而不积极完成任务。有些地区还没有正确掌握价格政策，存在有“宁紧勿松”或忽高忽低的偏向。有些地区有“重收购轻供应”的思想，以致物资供应不足，助长了农民的惜售思想。也有些地区合作社收购小麦，不是便利农民出售，而是等客上门，甚至用强迫命令、登记摊派等方式收购，引起群众不满。这些缺点，都应在收购秋粮中加以高度注意和纠正。
    今年各地购麦工作中，有那些经验可作收购秋粮工作的参考呢？
    一、正确贯彻“优粮优价、按质论价”的价格政策和“好次都收”的方针。这是维护农民利益，鼓励农民售粮的关键。今年不少地区的合作社与粮食局，在收购前都召开了验货员座谈会或举办短期训练班，学习分等论价政策和分级检验技术，提高了业务技术水平。有些合作社在收购中定期组织验货员碰头会，研究群众对验级意见，交流经验，统一标准，改进了检验技术。河北定县专区合作社公开展览样品；清苑县黄坨联村社采用民主评价方法，避免压级压价的偏向，售粮农民都十分拥护。福建省各地粮食部门和合作社组织检查小组，深入基层单位帮助评价，鼓励了农民踊跃售粮，六月份购粮数超过五月份的十倍半。相反的，有些粮食部门和合作社，没有贯彻“分等论价、好次兼收”的精神，购粮任务就不能完成。如今年贵州省晴隆县因小麦遭受病、虫、雹灾，一般出粉率为百分之三十至五十，但该县粮食局一定要规定小麦出粉率须在百分之七十以上才收，结果上市量百分之八十不合标准，粮食局不收购，私商就压价抢购。河南省夏邑县场集收购站，收麦时过筛三次，检验七次，农民嫌麻烦，就向私商投售。
    二、积极开辟货源，做好物资供应工作。各地经验证明，那里物资供应及时，适合农民的需要，那里购粮工作就能顺利开展；反之，收购工作就受到影响。如山东宁阳县城关社，当豆饼充分供应时，每天收购小麦达七万斤左右，豆饼脱销后，每天只能收购一万斤左右。陕西省长武县联社在收购小麦中，忽视供应农民所急需的犁铧、肥料、面碱、石油和火柴等工业品，结果使该县小麦收购工作基本陷于停顿，七月份只完成收购任务的千分之一点一二。在供应方法上，山东益都扬河联村社采取收购点设立货摊，陈列各种货品，以小型物品展览的形式，就站供应。河南镇平县所属合作社深入调查农民需要，有计划地供应物资，货品齐全，适合群众需要，受到群众欢迎。
    三、加强组织领导，提高购粮技术，改善服务态度。今年山东、河南、河北、山西等大部分地区的收购站，备有凉棚、茶水，招待农民也态度和蔼，对老幼体弱农民，主动帮助扛粮、过磅、倒堆，群众说，合作社就是咱们自己的家啊！还有一些合作社收购点，采取轮班制，天亮即开秤，日落停收，做到随来随收。安徽、河北部分地区合作社采用了流水作业法，明确分工，各负专责，缩短了收购时间，基本上达到了农民“快卖、快买、快回家”的要求。不少地区合作社改变了过去等客上门、死守柜台的购粮方法，在收购点不多而相距又远，或在农忙季节和不是集日时，就有计划地组织了流动收购或送货上门、就地购粮，一边宣传，一边收购，一边供应，颇受群众欢迎。如上海市郊区春塘乡流动小组的收购量，相当于固定站收购量的三倍。河北行唐、无极、邢台、唐山等地，经宣传动员，在农民自愿的基础上，有计划有组织地进行集体售麦。这种办法，证明也收效良好。
    四、及时修订购粮计划。今年有些地区由于对小麦生产情况估计不确实，对灾情估计过高，对产量估计过低，购粮计划一般的过小。有些购粮单位极易完成或超额完成计划，产生自满和松劲的现象。浙江省台州县的占塘、花桥合作社因收购任务完成，即请示县合作社停止收购。四川省永川县粮食局委托七个合作社收购粮食，因已完成任务，现在只有四个合作社继续收购。这些收购单位不了解，由于他们编制计划过小，就不能满足国家的需要和农民售粮要求，甚至引起农民不满。有些地区购粮单位，在完成计划后，及时总结经验，分析情况，重新修订计划，主动解决因超额完成计划而来的资金、仓库、调运等困难，继续展开收购工作。这种做法是正确的。
