    New Fishermen's Song
    Gao Yuan
    "The People's Liberation Army comrades are so good!
    Fish are expensive and rice is cheap, a good life.
    When Ye Shengfu's father died, he was going to be thrown into the sea,
    Thanks to the People's Liberation Army for burying him.
    If it weren't for the People's Liberation Army coming to this place,
    Fishermen would have no good end when they died!"
    This is one of the many new fishermen's songs praising the People's Liberation Army. You can hear it everywhere in the Wanshan Islands in the South China Sea. Whether it is adults or children, they sing this song with infinite gratitude, because the story it tells is so shocking to the fishermen's hearts.
    The fishermen in the South China Sea were cruelly oppressed by the feudal dynasty in the past. The rules for them were: live on the boat all their lives, not allowed to wear shoes on shore, and not allowed to be buried on land when they died. For hundreds of years, children have watched their parents' bodies being thrown into the sea to be torn to pieces by sharks.
    It was not long after our troops arrived on the island that Ye Shengfu's father died. Seeing that Ye Shengfu was about to throw his parents who raised him into the sea to be eaten by sharks, who could not be heartbroken by this tragic situation? But the fishermen never thought that the old rule that dead people are not allowed to be buried on land could be changed. For hundreds of years, it seemed as eternal and unchanging as the sun rising in the east and setting in the west. Therefore, Ye Shengfu's family could not help but cry out for their unfortunate fate.
    The cries came from the boat and reached the ears of the soldiers. What an unfortunate encounter! How could the soldiers not ask about it?
    The soldiers finally knew what was going on. They rushed to the company headquarters and reported to the company commander. When the company commander heard this, he naturally thought of his own parents being forced to death by the landlords, and the tragic situation of poor people having no place to be buried in the past. Who knew that here, those man-eating demons actually made the rule that the dead are not allowed to be buried into a matter of course, and it still threatens the good people even now. The company commander's eyes were moist. He silently took down his bunk board and said after a while: "Come! Let's use the bunk board to make a coffin and bury Ye Shengfu's father as if we were treating our own relatives. We must use the facts to tell the fisherman brothers that the ruling class of the past has been overthrown, and their 'old rules' should also be overthrown completely."
    Many soldiers moved their luggage to the ground, took down their bunk boards, and chose the best boards to make a good coffin themselves, and brushed it several times with black paint made of pot smoke and pig blood. Some people went to the mountains to pick a lot of fresh flowers and tied them into several large wreaths.
    Is this really true? For hundreds of years, poor fishermen who were looked down upon could also be buried on land when they died, and so many soldiers carried the coffin, carried the wreaths, and sent them to the cemetery with gongs and drums. They also chose the best mountain land on the island, built such a big tomb, and erected a large stone tablet... How many ages! Who here fishermen, dare to have such a wish, who dare to have such a dream? But this is not a dream, but a real fact. Because Chairman Mao's team—the people's own team—has come to this island.
    So, new fishermen's songs praising the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, and new fishermen's songs praising the liberation of the fishermen are sung everywhere. Let these songs sing out all their joy and gratitude!

    新渔歌
    高源
    “解放军同志来了真好啊！
    鱼贵米贱好生涯。
    叶胜福的父亲死了要往海里抛，
    亏得解放军去埋葬。
    要不是解放军来到这地方，
    打鱼人死了那有好下场！”
    这是渔民歌颂解放军的许多新渔歌中的一首。你在南海万山群岛一带，到处都可以听见，无论是大人或是小孩，都怀着无限的感激唱着这支歌。因为它所叙述的事情，是这样震动着渔民的心。
    南海一带的打鱼人，过去受到封建王朝的残酷的压迫，对于他们的规矩是：一生住在船上，上岸不准穿鞋，死了还不能在陆地上埋。几百年来，做儿女的都是眼睁睁地看着自己父母的尸体被抛到大海里。
    那还是我们部队刚到岛上不久的时候，渔民叶胜福的父亲死了。眼看着，叶胜福又要把生养自己的亲人丢到海里被沙鱼撕得一片片地吃掉，谁能不为这悲惨的境遇而心碎呢？可是渔民们根本想不到，死人不准葬在陆地上这个老规矩可以改变。几百年来，它似乎是和太阳出东落西一样地永恒不变。于是，叶胜福家里的人，不能不为自己的不幸的命运放声痛哭了。
    哭声从船上传出来，传到战士们的耳朵里。这是多么不幸的遭遇啊！战士们怎能不闻不问呢？
    战士们终于知道了是怎么一回事情。他们飞快地跑到连部，向连长作了报告。连长一听，很自然地联想起自己父母被地主逼死的情景，联想起过去穷人死无葬身之地的惨况。谁知道在这里，那些吃人的恶魔竟把死人不准安葬订成天经地义的规矩，而直到现在它还威胁着善良的人民。连长眼眶润湿了，他默默地把自己的铺板取下来，好一会才说道：“来！咱们用铺板钉一口棺材，要像对待自己的亲人一样来安葬叶胜福的父亲。我们要用事实告诉渔民兄弟，过去的统治阶级被打倒了，他们订下的‘老规矩’也应该统统打倒。”
    许多战士都把行李搬到地上，取下自己的铺板，并且选了最好的板子，自己动手做成一口很好的棺材，并且用锅烟子、猪血等自造的黑漆刷了好几遍。还有人到山里采了一大堆鲜花，扎成好几个大花圈。
    难道这是真事吗？几百年来被人瞧不起的穷苦的渔民死了也能葬在陆地上，并且还有这么多当兵的抬着棺材，抬着花圈，打着锣鼓送到墓地上。他们还给选了岛上最好的山地，给筑了这么大的坟墓，给立了一块大石碑……多少年代啊！这里的渔民，谁敢有这样的愿望，谁敢有这样的梦想呢？但这不是梦，而是千真万确的事实。因为毛主席的队伍——人民自己的队伍来到这岛上了。
    于是，歌颂共产党和解放军的新渔歌，歌颂渔民翻身的新渔歌到处唱起来了。让这些歌把他们全部的欢欣和感激都唱出来吧！
