This year's national water conservancy construction projects have now been basically completed. This year's water conservancy construction policy focuses on flood control, drainage, and expanding irrigation areas. The main tasks are to continue the fundamental treatment of the Huai River and the Yongding River, complete the partial renovation of Dongting Lake, formulate a preliminary plan for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River, and continue to expand the irrigation area.

The third year of the Huai River treatment project mainly includes the construction of three valley reservoirs, namely, the Boshan, Nanwan, and Foziling Reservoirs; river regulation projects for the Hong River, Ying River, Huiji River, Hei River, Bao River, Quan River, and Gang River; the Menghe Depression flood storage project; diversion projects for the main and tributary streams below Wuhe; the construction of the Chengdong Lake intake gate, Wangjiaba intake gate, and Runheji ship lock; the final works of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal drainage canal, the canal head project of the Shaobo and Xiannvmiao sections of the South Main Canal, and the Three Rivers Gate control project downstream of Hongze Lake. Now, except for the reservoir projects which are still under construction according to the planned schedule, the remaining projects have been completed one after another.

The Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River is the largest reservoir under construction in the country and is a key project for fundamentally controlling the Yongding River and developing the Yongding River basin. The three main components of the reservoir project—the dam, the aqueduct, and the spillway—are expected to be completed by the end of September, except for the entire aqueduct project, which is planned to be completed in the spring of next year. To welcome National Day, the workers have completed the dam project ten days ahead of schedule and are now working hard to complete the spillway project ahead of schedule.

The renovation project of South Dongting Lake mainly involves improving the flood channels of the Xiang River and Zi River entering the lake, and considering blocking and restoring collapsed embankments and merging embankment groups in the future in coordination with the fundamental treatment plan; and constructing drainage gates such as Xinquansi, Nanhuzhou, and Zhaixinmiao. This project was completed between this spring and summer.

Hebei Province is carrying out the Duliu Jianhe estuary project in the lower reaches of the Daqing River, with the aim of reducing the threat of floods to Tianjin and the Jinpu Railway, and reducing the damage of floods to some farmland in the lower reaches of the Daqing River. The entire project was completed in July, and the flood diversion gate was opened on September 1 to divert floods, reducing the flooding in the Hebei area.

In terms of Yellow River management, the relevant departments organized eight survey teams to conduct comprehensive surveys on geography, geology, soil, plants, and agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in the loess plateau area of ​​Northwest China, where soil erosion is more serious. Another survey team is surveying the Yellow River channel from Ningxia to Tuoketuo and the Ordos sandy area. Huge work has also been done in terms of topography, leveling, geological exploration, and hydrological surveys. This year's Yellow River management project is still to strengthen the embankment and repair dangerous works.

The Yellow River diversion irrigation Jiwei project in Henan Province in the lower reaches of the Yellow River started construction in mid-March 1951. After more than two years of construction to August this year, the entire project has been completed according to the planned schedule. A total of 1,999 large and small buildings, including canal head gates, main canals, West Irrigation Area, East One Irrigation Area, East Two Irrigation Area, East Three Irrigation Area, Xiaoji Irrigation Area, Xinci Irrigation Area, and sediment settling ponds, have been built. The length of canals above the branch canal is as long as 4,945 kilometers. The irrigation canal will be able to introduce a huge flow of Yellow River water to irrigate 720,000 mu of farmland in Xinxiang, Huojia, Ji County, and Yanjin counties on the north bank of the Yellow River. In mid-August, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has abolished the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Jiwei Project Office and transferred the entire Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Jiwei Project to the management and leadership of the Henan Provincial People's Government.

In the construction of these projects, labor competitions were carried out on each construction site. The workers, peasants, and technicians participating in the project all showed high enthusiasm, used their brains, and found tricks, not only completed the task ahead of schedule, but also saved a lot of funds for the country. The steel bar binding workers of the Liuduo South Gate and North Gate of the Huai River treatment project originally took 36 hours for one person to tie a pier. After adopting the assembly line operation method, an average of 14 hours per person can tie one, making the entire project completed 20 days ahead of schedule. The Wangjiaba intake gate project saved 1 billion yuan in engineering costs for the country due to the vigorous development of the increase production and practice economy movement during construction, accounting for 5% of the total project cost of the intake gate. Among them, technicians Jiang Bingshui, Lu Zhongqing, and others proposed a rationalization proposal to not use concrete to pour the protective layer upstream of the gate, which not only ensured the quality of the project, but also saved the country more than 100 million yuan. The concrete pouring workers learned the advanced concrete mix ratio method of the Foziling Reservoir, saving cement worth more than 300 million yuan. Technicians and workers closely integrated and universally promoted the assembly line operation method in formwork erection, steel bar binding, concrete pouring, and stone masonry projects, which generally increased work efficiency by one to two times. Worker Lu Zhizhong created the "thick steel bar cutting method", which increased work efficiency by 135%. The ordnance workers who installed the gates completed 26 days of installation tasks in 15 days. Worker Zhang Liangen created the "oil felt cutting method", which increased work efficiency three times. The Foziling Reservoir transportation workers collectively created a three-layer sieve analysis method for sand and gravel, which increased work efficiency by more than doubled and saved 2.1 billion yuan. The efficiency of earthwork on each construction site has also been greatly improved.

The water conservancy construction projects this year have received great help from Soviet experts. The original design of the spillway of the Guanting Reservoir overestimated the flow calculation. After the Soviet experts revised it, the stone opening and concrete pouring projects were greatly reduced. The design of the water intake tower of the aqueduct was made under the direct guidance of Soviet experts. During the construction period, Soviet experts went to the construction site to solve many complex and critical technical problems, ensuring the smooth progress of the project. When the Sanhe Gate was under construction, it was found that there was silt under the gate foundation and the design of the scour prevention project was wrong. Soviet experts guided the excavation of the silt, filled it with good soil, and added scour prevention grooves upstream and downstream of the gate, ensuring the safety of the gate body. In addition, Soviet experts also helped survey many planned irrigation projects and reservoir sites, inspected the research and testing work of research institutes and hydrological stations, and introduced many advanced experiences and methods.

The construction of these projects has played a certain role in reducing natural disasters and ensuring increased grain production. The Subei Irrigation Main Canal has begun to play an irrigation role this year, making the 2 million mu of farmland irrigated by the Subei Irrigation Main Canal along the coast and on both sides of the canal have a bumper harvest. This year, the rice production in Huai'an, Funing, Baoying and other counties increased by about 20% compared with last year, and corn production increased by 30%; which is a rare year in these areas in recent years. After the Subei Irrigation Main Canal was released, many areas changed some miscellaneous grain fields to rice fields with higher yields. Jiashu District of Huai'an County converted more than 20,000 mu of rice fields. Fengyu, Guanjian, and other townships in Binhai County have never grown rice. This year, after the No. 5 Weir culvert was released, farmers changed many dry land to rice. The Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River has begun to control floods. In late August, the maximum inflow of flood into the Guanting Reservoir reached 3,700 cubic meters per second, and the maximum water level in the reservoir reached 463.76 meters, reducing the threat of floods to the lower reaches of the Yongding River.

    今年水利工程基本完工
    【本报讯】一九五三年度全国水利建设工程现已基本完工。今年度水利建设的方针，是以防洪、防涝、扩大灌溉面积为重点。主要任务是继续进行淮河、永定河的根本治理，完成洞庭湖的局部整修，订出根治黄河的初步方案，并继续扩大灌溉面积。
    治淮第三年度的工程，主要包括修建薄山、南湾、佛子岭三个山谷水库；洪河、颍河、惠济河、黑河、包河、泉河、港河等河道整理工程；濛河洼地蓄洪工程；五河以下干支流分流工程；建造城东湖进水闸、王家坝进水闸和润河集船闸；苏北灌溉总渠排水渠尾工、南干渠邵伯、仙女庙段渠首工程以及洪泽湖下游三河闸控制工程。现在，除水库工程仍在按预定计划继续修筑外，其余工程都已先后完工。
    永定河官厅水库是全国正在兴建中的容积最大的一个水库，是根治永定河和开发永定河流域的重点工程。水库工程的三个主要组成部分——拦河坝、输水道、溢洪道，除输水道全部工程计划在明年春天完工外，拦河坝和溢洪道都预计在九月底完工。工人们为了迎接国庆节，已提前十天完成拦河坝工程，现在正努力争取提前完成溢洪道工程。
    南洞庭湖的整理工程，主要是改善湘水、资水入湖洪道，并考虑将来配合治本计划而堵复溃垸及合并堤垸；并建筑新泉寺、南湖洲及寨新庙等排水闸。这一项工程，在今年春夏之间就完成了。
    河北在大清河下游举办独流减河入海工程，目的在减轻洪水对天津市和津浦铁路的威胁，并使大清河下游一部分农田减免水灾危害。全部工程已在七月完工，并于九月一日开启进洪闸分洪，减轻了河北地区的水患。
    在治理黄河方面，由有关部门组织了八个查勘队，在水土流失比较严重的西北黄土高原区进行了有关地理、地质、土壤、植物以及农、林、牧业各方面的综合查勘。另一查勘队正在查勘从宁夏到托克托的黄河河道及鄂尔多斯风沙区。在地形、水准测量、地质勘探和水文测验等方面也进行了巨大的工作。今年黄河治理工程仍是加强堤防、修整险工。
    黄河下游河南省境内的引黄灌溉济卫工程，从一九五一年三月中旬开工兴修，到今年八月施工两年多，整个工程已按预订计划全部修建完成。计建成渠首闸、总干渠、西灌区、东一灌区、东二灌区、东三灌区、小冀灌区、新磁灌区和沉沙池等大小建筑物一千九百九十九座。修筑斗渠以上渠道长达四千九百四十五公里。灌溉渠将可引入巨大流量的黄水，灌溉黄河北岸新乡、获嘉、汲县、延津等县七十二万亩农田。八月中旬，黄河水利委员会已撤销了引黄灌溉济卫工程处，将引黄灌溉济卫工程全部工程移交河南省人民政府管理领导。
    在修建这些工程中，各工地都开展了劳动竞赛。参加工程的工人、民工和技术人员，都发挥了高度的热情，开动脑筋、寻找窍门，不但提前完成了任务，并为国家节省了大量资财。治淮工程六垛南闸和北闸的扎钢筋铁工，原来一个人要三十六小时才能扎好一个门墩，采用流水作业法后，平均每人十四小时即可扎成一个，使得全部工程提前二十天完工。王家坝进水闸工程，由于在施工中大力开展增产节约运动，到工程结束时共为国家节省工程费十亿元，占进水闸全部工程经费百分之五。其中技术员蒋炳水、陆仲清等提出在水闸上游不用混凝土浇保护层的合理化建议，不仅保证了工程质量，并为国家节省一亿多元。浇灌混凝土工人学习了佛子岭水库先进混凝土级配法，节省水泥价值三亿多元。技术人员和工人紧密结合，在立模板、扎钢筋、浇混凝土和砌石工程中，普遍推行了流水作业法，使工作效率普遍提高一倍到两倍。工人陆志中创造了“粗钢筋扎口断料法”，使工作效率提高百分之一百三十五。安装闸门的军工们在十五天内完成了二十六天的安装任务。工人张连根，创造“油毛毡剪裁法”，使工作效率提高三倍。佛子岭水库运输工人集体创造砂石三层筛分析法，使工作效率提高一倍以上，节省了二十一亿元。各工地在土方工作效率上也有很大提高。
    今年度水利建设工程，得到了苏联专家很大的帮助。官厅水库溢洪道的原设计对流量计算过大，经苏联专家修正后，大大减少了开石和浇筑混凝土工程。输水道进水塔的设计是在苏联专家直接指导下作成的。在施工期间，苏联专家到工地解决了许多复杂而带有关键性的技术问题，保证了工程的顺利进行。三河闸施工时发现闸基下有淤泥，防冲工程设计有错误，苏联专家指导挖去淤泥、填还好土，并在闸的上下游加做防冲槽等，使闸身的安全得到了保证。此外，苏联专家并帮助查勘了许多计划中的灌溉工程和水库库址，检查了研究所和水文站的研究和测验工作，介绍了许多先进的经验和方法。
    这些工程的兴建，对减少自然灾害和保证粮食增产，已经起了一定的作用。苏北灌溉总渠今年已开始发挥灌溉作用，使灌溉总渠沿岸和运河两岸引水灌溉的二百万亩农田丰收。今年淮安、阜宁、宝应等县的水稻比去年增产二成左右，玉米增产三成；是这些地区近年来少有的年成。苏北灌溉总渠放水后，不少地区把部分杂粮田改为收获量较高的稻田。淮安县嘉树区改稻田两万多亩。滨海县丰余、官尖等乡是从来不种稻子的，今年五圩涵洞放水后，农民们把很多旱田改种了稻子。永定河官厅水库已经开始拦洪，八月下旬，流入官厅水库的洪水最高流量每秒达三千七百立方公尺，库内最高水位达四百六十三点七六公尺，减轻了洪水对永定河下游的威胁。
