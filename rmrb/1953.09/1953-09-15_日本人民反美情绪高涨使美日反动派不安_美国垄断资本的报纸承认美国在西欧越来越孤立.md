    Japanese People's Rising Anti-American Sentiment Annoys U.S.-Japan Reactionaries
    U.S. Monopoly Capital Newspaper Admits U.S. Increasingly Isolated in Western Europe
   [Xinhua News Agency, 13th] New York dispatch: The increasingly rising anti-American sentiment of the Japanese people is becoming a topic of discussion in American newspapers with increasing frequency. The "New York Times" discussed this issue continuously on the 7th and 8th, reflecting the anxiety of the American ruling group regarding their rule in Japan.
    The "New York Times" published a Tokyo dispatch on the 7th, stating that "many Japanese officials and Americans are becoming increasingly anxious about the growth of anti-American sentiment among the Japanese people."
    The "New York Times" admitted that the American military occupation of Japan is the main reason for the anti-American sentiment among the Japanese people. It said: "The stationing of U.S. armed forces in Japan is at the center of this problem." The U.S. seizure of large amounts of Japanese land as military bases is "one of the most hotly debated and frequently mentioned issues by the Japanese people." The dispatch continued: "Japanese farmers who only have small plots of two acres per person are very sensitive even to losing one acre of land for cultivation. Fishermen in areas used for target practice or naval exercises strongly complain that such activities reduce their fish catches. As a result, a strong protest movement has developed throughout Japan against leasing more land to the U.S. military, and even against extending the current lease term."
    The dispatch admitted that the U.S. occupation forces' announcement after the San Francisco Peace Treaty to withdraw from major Japanese cities, under pressure from the Japanese people's opposition, was actually a deception. It said: "Another annoying thing is that although U.S. military personnel have elaborate plans and promises to leave densely populated cities, they actually stubbornly refuse to leave the cities." The dispatch also admitted that the U.S. military's immoral and lewd behavior is deeply resented by the Japanese people. It wrote: "There are many articles in Japanese publications that fiercely criticize the cafes, cheap nightclubs, brothels, and many 'street goddesses' that have appeared with the stationing of U.S. troops."
      The "New York Times" published an editorial on the 8th commenting on the anti-American sentiment of the Japanese people. The editorial admitted that the anti-American sentiment of the Japanese people "is inevitable." It said: "Americans were the first to test the atomic bomb on the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese hate Americans." Although the editorial pretended to be calm and talked about the anti-American sentiment of the Japanese people "originally being expected," it could not help but worry and say: "Any measures that Americans force Japan to implement, or even persuade Japan to implement, such as... military occupation, will ultimately be invalidated by the resentment of the Japanese people."
     [Xinhua News Agency, 14th] "Throughout Western Europe, America's political leadership seems to be coming to an end." The important mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital, "U.S. News & World Report," issued this warning in the first sentence of an article published not long ago.
    The article said: "The United States is losing its old friends one by one. European decision-makers, under pressure from the troubles they are encountering, are leaving Western unity and American support. ... The United States and its policies are losing ground.
      "The sentiment for dealing with Russia, trading with the Soviet bloc, and delaying the establishment of defense is constantly growing. Hopes for establishing a European army and reducing trade barriers are being put on hold. Except for West Germany, efforts to restore the economy have become fatigued. The center parties supported by the United States are not successful in implementing their reform policies. Political instability is growing."
    The article continued: "Despite efforts to maintain unity on both sides of the Atlantic, the trend of breaking away from American leadership is continuing."
    The article admitted that the U.S. dollar has not been able to contain Western Europe. The article listed various situations developing within Britain, France, Italy, and even West Germany that violated Washington's wishes, and then pointed out that throughout Western Europe, there is a growing desire to "do business as usual" with the East.
    The article said: "Europeans believe that as long as the United States relaxes the 'Cold War,' it can reduce defense spending and do more business with the Soviet bloc. ... The sentiment for independence is becoming stronger and stronger." The final conclusion of the article is: "In most (Western European) countries, political stability will be further weakened, European unity will be further weakened, and the willingness to support the United States against Russia will be further weakened. Everywhere, Washington is facing a Western bloc that is beginning to break away from American leadership."

    日本人民反美情绪高涨使美日反动派不安
    美国垄断资本的报纸承认美国在西欧越来越孤立
   【新华社十三日讯】纽约消息：日本人民一天天高涨的反美情绪，越来越频繁地成为美国报纸谈论的题目。七日和八日的“纽约时报”连续谈到这个问题，反映出美国统治集团对于他们在日本的统治的不安。
    “纽约时报”七日刊载的东京通讯说“许多日本官员和美国人对于日本人民中反美情绪的增长，越来越感到焦急”。
    “纽约时报”承认，美国对日军事占领是造成日本人民反美的主要原因。它说：“美国武装部队驻扎在日本，是这个问题的中心。”美国霸占日本大量土地作为军事基地，是“日本人民争论得最热烈并且经常提到的问题之一”。通讯接着说：“每人只有小小两英亩田地的日本农民，对于即使要他们丧失一英亩田地的耕种，也是非常敏感的。在被用来打靶或作海军演习的地区的渔民，对于这类活动使他们减少了打鱼收获，发出强烈的怨言。结果，在日本全国发展了强烈的抗议运动，反对再租借土地给美国军队，甚至反对延长现在的租借期限。”
    通讯承认美国对日占领军在旧金山单独和约后迫于日本人民的反对而宣布撤出日本大城市一举，实际上是一种欺骗。它说：“另一点使人恼怒的事是：美国军事人员，虽然有了完善的计划和诺言要离开人口众多的大城市，但实际上仍旧死死地不肯离开城市。”通讯也承认，美军伤风败俗的淫乱秽行也为日本人民所深恶痛绝。它写道：“日本刊物上有不少文章猛烈地抨击随着美军的驻扎而出现的咖啡馆、廉价的夜总会、妓馆和许多的‘街头神女’。”
      八日的“纽约时报”发表社论评论日本人民的反美情绪。社论承认日本人民反美“是势所必然的”。它说：“美国人首先拿日本人来试验原子弹。因此，日本人憎恨美国人”。社论虽然强作镇定地高谈日本人民的反美“原在意料之中”，但是他不能不担心地说：“美国人强要日本实施、甚至劝导日本实施任何措施，例如……军事占领之类，到头来只会因日本人的愤恨而趋于无效。”
     【新华社十四日讯】“在整个西欧，美国的政治领导权似乎要完蛋了。”美国垄断资本的重要喉舌
  “美国新闻与世界报道”在不久前刊载的一篇文章里劈头第一句就发出这种警号。
    这篇文章说：“美国正在一个一个地失掉它的老朋友。负责决策的欧洲人迫于他们所碰到的麻烦，正在离开西方的团结和美国的支持。……美国和它的政策正在失势。
      “要求和俄国打交道、和苏联集团贸易、延缓建立防务的情绪不断增长。建立欧洲军和减低贸易壁垒的希望正在被搁置。除西德外，恢复经济的努力已经趋于疲怠。美国所支持的中间党派实施它们的改良政策时并不顺利。政治的不稳定正在增长。”
    这篇文章继续说：“尽管在大西洋两岸都力图保持团结，但脱离美国领导的趋向在继续中。”
    这篇文章承认，美元并没有能套住西欧。文章列举了在英国、法国、意大利以至西德内部发展的种种违反华盛顿愿望的情况，接着指出，在西欧，到处都有着一种要求和东方“照旧做生意”的日益增长的愿望。
    这篇文章说：“欧洲人认为：只要美国放松‘冷战’，就可以减少防务开支，就可以和苏联集团做更多的买卖。……独立的情绪正在越来越强烈。”这篇文章的最后结论是：“在（西欧）大多数国家中，政治上的稳定性会更减弱，欧洲团结会更减弱，支持美国反对俄国的意愿会更减弱。到处，华盛顿面对着一个开始摆脱美国的领导的西方集团。”
