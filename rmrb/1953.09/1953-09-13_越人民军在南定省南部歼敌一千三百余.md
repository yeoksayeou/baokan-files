    越人民军在南定省南部歼敌一千三百余
    【新华社十二日讯】越南通讯社最近报道了越南人民军八月间在南定省南部海后县粉碎法军八个营的“扫荡”的经过。
    在这历时十八天的反扫荡战中，人民军取得歼灭法军一千三百四十多名的胜利，粉碎了法军企图平定红河三角洲的一部分计划。
    八月一日在敌军行动开始后，人民军立刻袭击杜社的法军指挥据点，歼灭敌军一百四十名，其中有法军上校一名和少校两名。敌军第三师师长和参谋长都在这次战斗中被打伤。
    八月四日，敌军进犯海后县北部，但遭到人民军地方部队的截击。在一个星期中，人民军作战二十六次，杀伤敌军四百一十多名。虽然法军在“扫荡”中纠集了大量军队，人民军仍在八月十日晚间突袭交水县的大东法军据点，杀伤敌军一百名，俘掳七名，其中有一个中尉和两个少尉。
    敌军在海后县北部遭到打击以后，就在八月十日转而窜犯该县南部。他们在那里又遭到了人民军的猛烈反击。从八月十日到十八日，海后县南部的人民军部队杀伤了敌军约四百名，解放了被敌军拘留的一百个青年。同时邻近的义兴县游击队也胜利出击，杀伤敌军一百多名。
    到八月十八日，敌军因损失重大，不得不退出海后县。
    人民军在这历时十八天的战斗中，一共歼灭敌军一千三百四十四名，其中打死一千零六十四名、打伤一百三十九名，俘掳一百四十一名。击毁炮舰两艘，击毁和缴获大量武器和军火。
