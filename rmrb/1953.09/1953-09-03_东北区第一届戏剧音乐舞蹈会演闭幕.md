The First Northeast China Drama, Music, and Dance Festival concluded in Shenyang on August 30th.

Since its opening on July 25th, the festival showcased 167 drama, opera, Peking opera, Ping opera, Bangzi opera, music, and dance programs from various parts of Northeast China, totaling 94 performances. Many of the 51 drama and Ping opera programs performed were new creations by Northeast literary and artistic workers, based on in-depth experiences in factories and rural areas, and reflecting real life. The play "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nuomin River," performed by the Northeast People's Art Theater Drama Troupe, reflected the ideological struggle among current rural cadres against rash advances and uniting with middle peasants to steadily establish agricultural production cooperatives. The author vividly portrayed some unforgettable typical characters in this play.

The festival featured 76 music and dance programs. The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Song and Dance Troupe of Jilin Province, the Oroqen Ethnic Song and Dance Troupe of Heihe, Heilongjiang Province, and other units performed many programs with strong ethnic and folk styles. Among them, the Rehe Provincial Drama Troupe performed the "Flower Cymbal Dance," which was almost lost in the Kalaqin Left Banner area.

Many scripts and performances achieved excellent results in this festival. The works that won awards included the music and dance pieces "The Sun Comes Out, The Sky is Red," "Daughter's Song," "For Everlasting Peace and Happiness," and fourteen others, Peking opera "Three Unwillingnesses" and two others, Ping opera "Female Teacher," "Teapot Scheme" and three others, the composition of the opera "A Spark of Fire," drama "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nuomin River," "Women Representatives," "Red Flag," and six others. Performances that won awards included the music "Da Gang and Xiao Lan," the dance "Dayangko," the Ping opera "Teapot Scheme," "The Tale of the White Snake," and twelve other Peking opera and drama programs. Units that won collective performance awards included the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Song and Dance Troupe Choir of Jilin Province, the Northeast People's Art Theater Music and Dance Troupe Choir, and the directors and actors of the drama "People Strive for Higher Positions" and the Ping opera "Husband and Wife Cooperation," and twenty-eight other units. A total of 292 people, including Qin Youmei, Gao Yaqiao, Han Shaoyun, Xi Cailing, Hua Shulan, and Li Moran, won outstanding performance awards and performance awards. Twenty people, including Yan Zheng and Zhang Shouwei, won director awards. In addition, 85 units and individuals who had made certain achievements in music conducting, stage art, opera reform, art teaching, and opera music received certificates of merit.

During this performance period, literary and artistic workers in Northeast China carefully observed the performed programs and held various group meetings, symposiums, and special reports for research and discussion, and exchanged experiences. During the festival, the opera reform policy inspection team of the conference went deep into the delegations to understand the implementation of opera reform policies in various places and the existing problems, and held a symposium of opera actor representatives on these issues. In addition to commending outstanding cadres and actors who conscientiously implemented the opera reform policy, the conference also suggested that provinces and cities criticize and deal with cadres who violated the opera reform policy or violated laws and disciplines.

    大会演出的音乐、舞蹈节目有七十六个。吉林省延边朝鲜民族自治区歌舞团、黑龙江省黑河鄂伦春族歌舞团等单位，在会演中演出了许多带有强烈的民族和民间风格的节目，其中热河省话剧团演出了喀喇沁左旗一带几乎失传的“花钹舞”等。
    在这次观摩大会上，很多剧本和演出都获得优异的成绩。获作品奖的有音乐、舞蹈“太阳出来满天红”、“闺女之歌”、“为了永远的和平与幸福”等十四个，京剧“三不愿意”等二个，评剧“女教师”、“茶瓶计”等三个，歌剧“星星之火”的作曲一个，话剧“春风吹到了诺敏河”、“妇女代表”、“红旗”等六个。获演出奖的有音乐“大刚与小兰”，舞蹈“大秧歌”，评剧“茶瓶计”、“白蛇传”及京剧、话剧等节目十二个。得集体表演奖的有吉林省延边朝鲜民族自治区歌舞团合唱队，东北人民艺术剧院音乐舞蹈团合唱队和话剧“人往高处走”、评剧“夫妻合作”的导演、演员等二十八个单位。得优秀表演奖与表演奖的有秦友梅、高亚樵、韩少云、喜彩苓、花淑兰、李默然等共二百九十二名。得导演奖的有严正、张守维等二十名。另在音乐指挥、舞台美术及戏曲改革、艺术教学、戏曲音乐等方面有一定成绩的八十五个单位和个人获得了奖状。
    东北区的文艺工作者在这次演出期间，认真观摩了上演的节目，并曾举行各种小组会、座谈会、专题报告会进行研究讨论，交流经验。会演期中，大会戏曲改革政策检查组曾深入各代表团，了解各地执行戏曲改革政策的情况及所存在的问题，并就这些问题召开了戏曲演员代表座谈会。大会除对认真执行戏曲改革政策有成绩的优秀干部和演员给予表扬外，并建议各省市对违反戏曲改革政策或违法乱纪的干部，分别予以批评和处理。（新华社）
