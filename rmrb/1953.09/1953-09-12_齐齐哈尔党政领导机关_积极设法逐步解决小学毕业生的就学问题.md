Qiqihar Party and Government Leading Organs
Actively Seek Ways to Gradually Solve the Schooling Problem of Primary School Graduates
The Qiqihar Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Qiqihar Municipal People's Government are actively seeking ways, within the realm of possibility, to solve the schooling problem of primary school graduates. As early as before the unified enrollment of secondary schools in Qiqihar, the Qiqihar Municipal Party and Government leading organs convened a meeting of responsible comrades from various factories, government offices, and people's organizations in the city to earnestly discuss how to solve the schooling problem of primary school graduates in the city as much as possible. It was decided that factories would establish technical training classes, and additional supplementary classes and self-study organizations would be established so that primary school graduates who could not enter middle school could continue their studies. In the unified enrollment of secondary schools in the city, it was initially decided to enroll about 1,000 students. Later, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Government obtained approval from higher authorities to establish the Fourth Middle School, so that the enrollment quota could be increased to 1,200. For the remaining 2,400+ senior primary school graduates, after repeated research and discussions by the Municipal People's Government, it was decided that the Health Section of the Municipal People's Government would establish a nurse training class, and various factories, government offices, and people's organizations in the city would establish 17 supplementary classes. The Qiqihar Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League would organize a self-study class. In addition, the Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and the No. 2 Machine Tool Plant would respectively hold technical training classes, and the Qiqihar Railway Bureau would organize supplementary classes. In this way, the learning problem of senior primary school graduates can be largely solved. At present, the Municipal People's Government and relevant departments are actively carrying out preparatory work, and the above-mentioned supplementary classes and training classes will soon begin enrollment.
In order to promptly convey the various measures for solving the continued learning of senior primary school graduates to the students' parents and solicit their opinions, the Municipal People's Government invited more than 240 students' parents to a discussion meeting on August 27. At the meeting, the parents expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party and the People's Government for their deep concern for the students and their realistic attitude in actively solving problems. In their speeches, they unanimously believed that these are difficulties in the country's economic construction period, difficulties in victory and development, and expressed that they would fully cooperate with the government to solve the schooling problem of primary school graduates who failed to enter middle school.

    齐齐哈尔党政领导机关
    积极设法逐步解决小学毕业生的就学问题
    中共齐齐哈尔市委和齐齐哈尔市人民政府，正在可能范围内，积极设法解决小学毕业生的就学问题。早在齐齐哈尔市内各中等学校统一招生前，齐齐哈尔市党政领导机关就召集了该市各工厂、机关、人民团体的负责同志举行会议，认真讨论了如何尽可能解决市内小学毕业生就学问题。决定根据市内的人力和物力等条件，由工厂成立技术训练班，并另成立若干补习班和自修的学习组织，使不能升入中学的小学毕业生继续求学。市内各中等学校统一招生，初步决定录取一千名左右学生，后市委和市人民政府取得上级的批准，决定成立第四中学校，这样录取额即可增加到一千二百名。其余两千四百多名高小毕业生，经市人民政府多次研究商讨，决定市人民政府卫生科成立一护士训练班，市内各工厂、机关、人民团体成立十七个补习班，青年团齐齐哈尔市委组织一个自修班，再加齐齐哈尔第一机床厂和第二机床厂分别举办技术训练班，齐齐哈尔铁路局组织补习班，这样高小毕业生的学习问题大体上可以解决。目前市人民政府以及有关部门，正积极进行准备工作，上述各补习班、训练班即将开始招生。
    市人民政府为了把解决高小毕业生继续学习的各种措施及时传达给学生家长，并征求他们的意见，在八月二十七日邀请二百四十多位学生家长举行了座谈会。会上，家长们对共产党和人民政府对学生的深切关怀和实事求是地积极解决问题的态度表示衷心的感谢。他们在发言中，一致认为这是国家在经济建设时期中的困难，是胜利和发展中的困难，并表示要和政府充分合作，解决未能升入中学的小学毕业生的就学问题。
