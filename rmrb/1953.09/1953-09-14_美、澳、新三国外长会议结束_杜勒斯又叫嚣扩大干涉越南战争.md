Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 13th: According to TASS, Washington, 12th: The foreign ministers' meeting of the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, members of the American aggressive group "Pacific Pact," was held in Washington on September 9th and 10th. According to newspaper reports, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated at the opening of the meeting that one of the tasks of the meeting was to review the reports drafted by the military representatives of the "Pacific Pact" member states (who held a meeting in Pearl Harbor last week). Dulles mentioned his speech at the American Legion Convention in St. Louis (which explained U.S. intentions in Asia) and implied that the meeting participants should coordinate their plans with the intentions of U.S. imperialism. In this regard, newspapers emphasized the fact that Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Radford, and the new U.S. Pacific Commander, Admiral Stump, attended the meeting.

According to U.S. newspaper reports, Dulles, at one of the meetings, explained to the participants a secret plan to expand U.S. intervention in Indochina by lending the French government an additional $385 million to expand the Indochina war. Dulles did not specify the conditions for this appropriation. According to newspapers, this appropriation was endorsed by the U.S. National Security Council. Not long ago, the French weekly "Tribune of the Nation" reported that France was going to grant U.S. companies the mining rights for tin, tungsten, silver, and lead in Indochina, and that U.S. monopoly capital was squeezing out French companies in Indochina. "Tribune of the Nation" wrote: "As a result of U.S. financial and military assistance, France's economic position in Indochina is being seized by U.S. companies."

It is clear from the communique issued by the Washington meeting that the participants do not intend to increase the members of the so-called "Pacific Pact" Foreign Ministers' Council. As a result, the United States was able to continue to keep the door of the "Pacific Pact" closed to Britain, which has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that it is being ignored in the Pacific region because it has certain interests in this area.

### 美、澳、新三国外长会议结束  杜勒斯又叫嚣扩大干涉越南战争

    美、澳、新三国外长会议结束
    杜勒斯又叫嚣扩大干涉越南战争
   【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿十二日讯：参加美国侵略集团“太平洋联盟”的美、澳、新三国的外长会议已于九月九日和十日两天在华盛顿举行。据报纸报道，美国国务卿杜勒斯在会议开幕时曾说，会议的任务之一是要审查“太平洋联盟”各会员国军事代表（这些代表于上星期在珍珠港举行了会议）拟就的各项报告。杜勒斯曾提到他在圣路易斯美国退伍军人大会上的演说（这篇演说中说明了美国在亚洲的意图），同时并暗示：会议参加者应该把自己的计划与美国帝国主义的意图配合起来。在这方面，报纸着重指出了美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福海军上将和新任美国太平洋司令斯图普海军上将出席了这次会议的事实。
    据美国报纸报道，杜勒斯在某次会议上，向会议参加者阐明一项关于扩大美国对印度支那的干涉的秘密计划，办法是借给法国政府三亿八千五百万额外借款，作为扩大印度支那战争之用。杜勒斯没有说明这项拨款的条件是什么。据报纸说，这项拨款是为美国“国家安全委员会”所赞同的。不久以前，法国“民族论坛”周刊曾报道了法国要把印度支那的锡矿、钨矿、银矿、铅矿的开采权让给美国公司，以及关于美国垄断资本在印度支那排挤法国公司的情况。“民族论坛”周刊写道：“美国财政和军事援助的结果，使得法国在印度支那的经济地位正在被美国公司所夺去。”
    从华盛顿会议发表的公报中可以明显看出，会议参加者不打算增加所谓“太平洋联盟”外长理事会的成员。结果，美国得以继续关着“太平洋联盟”的大门，不让英国进来。而英国曾不止一次地对在太平洋地区忽视它这一事实表示不满，因为它在这一地区有一定的利益。
