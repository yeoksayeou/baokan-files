    Safety in operation is a fundamental issue in coal mine production. Because coal mine production takes place underground where natural conditions are extremely complex and constantly shifting, the production process requires a constant struggle against underground water, fire, gas, rock, and so on. Poor safety not only causes worker injuries and deaths but also immediately affects the normal progress of production, even bringing all underground production to a complete standstill. In coal mines, where safety is poor, production is inevitably poor; where safety is good, production inevitably flourishes. This extremely close relationship between safety and production is one of the basic characteristics of coal mine production.
    The People's Government has always attached importance to improving safety in coal mine production. In recent years, state-owned coal mines have universally carried out production reforms, abolished the old, unsafe high-drop and remnant-pillar mining methods, vigorously promoted new mining methods and mechanized production, and increased many safety devices. According to statistics, by the end of 1952, the working faces adopting new mining methods in national state-owned coal mines accounted for 86.96 percent of all mining faces, the output of mechanized mining faces accounted for 73.24 percent of the total output, and the mines adopting mechanized ventilation accounted for 92 percent. This has greatly reduced the labor intensity of miners and improved the conditions for safe production. In 1951, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry centralized the experience of various coal mines in safety production and absorbed the advanced scientific theories of the Soviet Union on coal mine safety production, formulating the "Coal Mine Technical Safety Regulations (Trial)." In recent years, state-owned coal mines in various regions have also launched mass safety production campaigns, criticizing the conservative thinking that "coal mines cannot avoid deaths" and various superstitious ideas from top to bottom, establishing a correct view of safety production, and cultivating many advanced figures and units in safety production such as Shi Yuhai and Liu Jiuxue. This fundamentally reversed the serious casualty situation in coal mines before liberation, which was known as "a piece of meat sandwiched between three pieces of coal," and people's mines where no one died began to emerge. Production also improved significantly as a result.
    However, since last year, safety production in coal mines has shown a trend of regression, and the situation has become even more serious in the first half of this year. In particular, coal mines in the Northeast and East China regions have seen their injury and death accidents increase by nearly one-fold and more than one-fold respectively compared with the same period last year. Many mine accidents have increased, and production has declined. Most state-owned coal mines failed to meet the state plan in the first half of this year.
    Why have accidents increased since last year? According to the analysis of coal mine accidents in various regions, this is primarily due to the fact that coal mine production has developed greatly in recent years, but many coal mines still use an old set of management methods and have not established a scientific planned management system adapted to today's production tasks. This makes coal mine production often in a state of confusion, taking care of one thing while losing sight of another. Injury and death accidents in various coal mines almost have a common pattern: good at the beginning of the month, poor at the end of the month; good at the beginning of the quarter, poor at the end of the quarter; fewer accidents during regular production, more accidents during crash programs. This shows that uneven production and accidents are closely inseparable.
    The situation in technical management is also the same. In recent years, state-owned coal mines in various regions have universally implemented new mining methods and mechanized production, which is a fundamental change in China's coal mine production. This change requires us to simultaneously improve operating methods and labor organization, roof management, underground transportation, fire and gas prevention, and many other tasks, that is, we must greatly strengthen technical management, improve workers' technical level, transform old labor habits, and strictly implement safety regulations. However, many coal mine management cadres and engineering technicians do not have a sufficient understanding of this huge change and have not strengthened technical management in a timely manner. For example, after the implementation of production mechanization, workers must be required to strictly implement safety regulations, but many grassroots cadres and workers in coal mines are still accustomed to the old, backward manual coal mining methods and habits. They feel that safety regulations are cumbersome and that "production tasks cannot be completed if safety regulations are implemented." Many grassroots cadres in coal mines take the lead in directing workers to violate safety regulations. Some mine managers lock the regulations in drawers without even looking at them once, and some do not even know that there are technical safety regulations. As a result of violating safety regulations, the occurrence of accidents inevitably becomes unavoidable. According to the analysis of coal mine accidents in 1952, more than 90 percent were caused by not operating in accordance with safety regulations.
    The one-sided task view of coal mine leaders at all levels, who only seek output and neglect safety, and the bureaucratic style of work are also important reasons for the continuous occurrence of accidents. In recent years, coal mine cadres have constantly criticized the erroneous idea of opposing safety and production; however, this problem has not been fundamentally resolved, and it has been implemented even worse, especially among grassroots cadres and newly promoted cadres. Many coal mine leaders do not plan safety work, do not report safety situations; higher-level cadres only ask lower-level cadres about output and do not ask about safety; lower-level cadres only pursue output from workers and do not pay attention to workers' suggestions related to safety. Sometimes, those who blindly pursue output regardless of safety are blindly praised and promoted, while those who adhere to safe operations are instead attacked. The Jixi Mining Bureau even rated a team leader from the Chengzhe River Mine, who had the most serious violations of regulations, as a model team leader for the entire bureau. Many coal mines do not transfer excellent cadres to enrich and improve safety institutions, do not establish and implement strict safety systems, do not go deep into the front lines to inspect safety situations, do not conduct safety production education for workers regularly, and turn a blind eye to the phenomena of some employees violating safety regulations and lax discipline, failing to deal with them in a timely manner and allowing them to drift along. As a result, safety regulations and operating procedures cannot be implemented. These are all reasons for the increase in accidents last year and in the first half of this year.
    Some coal mine leaders do not pay enough attention to necessary welfare facilities and safety equipment, and neglect labor protection and hygiene work; in some units, the phenomena of overtime work, absenteeism, and absences are still very serious, and the shift system cannot be well implemented, which makes production management lax and causes workers to be excessively fatigued. This is also an unavoidable reason for the occurrence of accidents.
    The key to doing a good job in coal mine safety production is to strengthen planned management and technical management, implement technical safety regulations, and add necessary safety equipment. However, in order to rapidly improve the current serious situation of safety work, coal mines in various regions should immediately start the following work.
    First, it is necessary to mobilize the masses from top to bottom to find the causes of accidents, think of solutions, and formulate plans for doing a good job in safety production in the future. Leaders should pay attention to discovering and cultivating advanced figures and units like Shi Yuhai and Liu Jiuxue among the masses, summarize and promote their advanced experience, and establish the banner of safety production.
    Second, it is necessary to organize leading cadres and employees to study technical safety regulations in a planned and led manner, and stipulate an examination system. The strict implementation of safety regulations is the basic key to doing a good job in safety production. Many coal mine leaders in the past did not have a sufficient understanding of this point and did not establish the view that regulations are production discipline. This work must be given importance in the future. It is necessary to improve the teaching materials and methods of safety education, and adopt various different teaching materials and learning methods according to different situations and objects.
    Third, it is necessary to establish and improve various necessary organizations and systems. It is necessary to establish a safety responsibility system. The mine manager and chief engineer should be primarily responsible for the safety work of the mine, and must personally take responsibility for mastering key technical issues. Safety-related issues in engineering design must be submitted to the technical safety inspection department for review. Strictly implement the leadership instruction book, handover instruction book, inspection opinion book, regular safety inspection, and safety activity day systems. Establish a safety meeting jointly composed of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League under the leadership of the mine area Party committee to check the implementation of safety plans and contracts, and absorb worker representatives to participate, listen to their opinions, and give play to the supervisory role of the masses. Strengthen technical safety organizations, equip them with people with a certain technical level and a high sense of responsibility to do inspection work, clarify their powers and responsibilities and scope of work, fully utilize the role of inspectors, and overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible. Some coal mines should appropriately adjust cadres, and cadres who seriously violate safety regulations and repeatedly fail to correct themselves should be immediately replaced, and safety production models should be promoted to production leadership positions.
    Fourth, it is necessary to strictly control workers' spare time. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, stipulate fixed spare time activity hours and stop the phenomenon of random overtime work. Mines with poor safety equipment must add necessary safety equipment and improve working conditions.
    Coal mine safety production is a long-term and arduous task, and there will definitely be difficulties. But we should also see that we are now in a favorable position to do a good job in safety production: technical equipment is much better than in the past, we have accumulated rich experience in safety production in recent years, and the consciousness of the masses has also been greatly improved. As long as we are determined, good at relying on the broad masses, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and actively fight against accidents, we can overcome all difficulties and guarantee the safe completion and overfulfillment of the production plan.

### 切实改善煤矿的安全生产工作

    切实改善煤矿的安全生产工作
    安全作业是煤矿生产中的根本问题。因为煤矿生产是在自然条件十分复杂而且不断移动的地下进行的，在生产过程中，必须时刻与各种地下的水、火、瓦斯、岩石等等作斗争。安全情况不好，不仅造成工人的伤亡，并且立即影响到生产的正常进行，甚至使整个井下生产全部停顿。在煤矿中，凡安全情况不好的，生产情况也必然不好；安全情况好的，生产必然欣欣向荣。安全与生产的这种极其密切的关系，是煤矿生产的基本特点之一。
    人民政府始终重视改进煤矿安全生产问题。几年来，国营煤矿中普遍进行了生产改革，废除了旧的不安全的高落式和残柱采煤法，大力推行了新采煤法和机械化生产，并增加了许多安全设备。据统计，截至一九五二年底，全国国营煤矿中采用新采煤方法的工作面已占全部采煤工作面的百分之八十六点九六，机械化采煤的工作面产量已占总产量的百分之七十三点二四，采用机械化通风的矿井已占百分之九十二，这样就大大减轻了矿工的劳动强度，改善了安全生产的条件。一九五一年，中央燃料工业部集中了各地煤矿安全生产方面的经验，吸取了苏联关于煤矿安全生产方面的先进科学理论，制订了“煤矿技术保安试行规程”。几年来，各地国营煤矿还先后开展了群众性的安全生产运动，从上到下批判了
    “煤矿不能不死人”的保守思想和各种迷信思想，确立了安全生产的正确观点，培养了施玉海、刘九学等许多安全生产的先进人物和先进单位，因而根本上扭转了解放前煤矿中所谓“三块煤里夹块肉”的严重伤亡情况，开始出现了不死人的人民矿山，生产情况也随之有了显著的好转。
    但是，从去年开始，煤矿的安全生产工作又呈倒退现象，今年上半年情况更显得严重，特别是东北地区和华东地区的煤矿，今年上半年的伤亡事故竟比去年同期增加了将近一倍和一倍以上。许多矿山事故增多，生产下降，今年上半年国营煤矿大部分都未完成国家计划。
    为什么从去年起事故有增无减呢？根据各地煤矿事故情况的分析，这首先是由于几年来煤矿生产大大发展了，而许多煤矿还沿用着一套旧的管理方法，没有建立起与今天的生产任务相适应的科学的计划管理，这就使得煤矿的生产常常处于顾此失彼的混乱状态。各地煤矿的伤亡事故几乎有一个共同的规律，就是月初好，月末差；季初好，季末差；正规生产时事故少，突击时事故就多；而事故愈多，情况愈坏。这就说明生产的不均衡和事故是密切不可分的。
    技术管理方面的情况也是这样。几年来，各地国营煤矿普遍地实行了新采煤法和机械化生产，这是我国煤矿生产中根本的变化。这个变化要求我们必须同时改进操作方法和劳动组织、顶板管理、井下运搬、防火防瓦斯等许多工作，即必须大大加强技术管理，提高工人技术水平，改造旧的劳动习惯，必须更严格地执行保安规程。但是许多煤矿管理干部和工程技术人员对这一巨大变化认识不足，没有及时地加强技术管理。例如实行生产机械化以后就必须要求工人们更严格地执行保安规程，但煤矿里许多基层干部和工人仍然习惯于旧的落后的手工采煤方法和习惯，他们感到保安规程碍手碍脚，“执行了保安规程就不能完成生产任务”。很多煤矿的基层干部带头指挥工人违反保安规程。有的矿长把规程锁在抽屉中一次未看，有的根本不知道有技术保安规程。违反保安规程的结果，必然使事故的发生成为不可避免。据一九五二年煤矿事故的分析，百分之九十以上都是由于不按保安规程操作而发生的。
    煤矿各级领导干部只求产量忽视安全的片面的任务观点和工作中的官僚主义作风，也是事故不断发生的重要原因。几年来，煤矿干部中曾不断批判了把安全与生产对立起来的错误思想；但这个问题始终没有根本解决，特别是在基层干部和新提拔的干部中贯彻得更差。不少煤矿的领导干部不计划安全工作，不报告安全情况；上级干部见下级干部只问产量不问安全；下级干部只向工人追产量，对工人有关安全的建议不注意解决。有时对单纯追求产量不顾安全者盲目表扬和提拔，对坚持安全作业者反而予以打击。鸡西矿务局竟将城子河矿违反规程最严重的一个班长评为全局模范班长。不少煤矿不调派优秀的干部去充实和健全安全机构，不建立和执行严格的保安制度，不深入现场检查安全情况，不经常对工人进行安全生产的教育，对于有些职工违反保安规程及纪律松弛等现象熟视无睹，不及时处理，任其自流，因而保安规程与操作规程不能贯彻。这些都是去年和今年上半年事故增多的原因。
    有些煤矿的领导干部对必要的福利设施和安全设备重视不够，忽视劳动保护和卫生工作；有些单位加班加点、旷工、缺勤现象还很严重，轮休制不能很好贯彻，使生产管理涣散，并使工人过分疲劳，这也是发生事故的一个不可忽视的原因。
    搞好煤矿安全生产的关键是加强计划管理和技术管理，贯彻技术保安规程，增设必要的安全设备。但为了迅速改善目前安全工作的严重情况，各地煤矿应该立即着手进行下列工作。
    首先要发动群众从上到下寻找发生事故的原因，想办法，订出今后作好安全生产的计划。领导上要注意在群众中发现和培养施玉海、刘九学式的先进人物和单位，总结和推广他们的先进经验，树立安全生产的旗帜。
    其次，必须有计划有领导地组织领导干部和职工群众学习技术保安规程，并规定考试制度。切实执行保安规程是做好安全生产的基本关键，许多煤矿领导干部过去对这点认识不足，没有确立起规程就是生产纪律的观点，今后必须重视这个工作。要改善保安教育的教材和教育方法，根据不同情况和对象，采用各种不同的教材和学习方法。
    第三，要建立和健全各种必要的组织和制度。要建立安全责任制，矿长、主任工程师对矿井的安全工作应负首要责任，对技术性的关键问题必须亲自负责掌握，凡工程设计中有关安全方面的问题，必须交由技术安全检查部门审查。严格执行领导指示簿、交接班指示簿、检查意见簿、定期安全检查和安全活动日等制度。建立由矿区党委所领导的党、行政、工会、青年团共同组成的保安会议，检查安全计划和合同的执行情况，并吸收工人代表参加，听取他们的意见，发挥群众的监督作用。要加强技术安全组织机构，配备有一定技术水平和高度责任心的人作检查工作，明确其职权和工作范围，充分发挥检查人员的作用，克服无人负责的现象。有些煤矿要适当地调整干部，对严重违犯保安规程而屡教不改的干部应即撤换，提拔安全生产模范到生产领导岗位上来。
    第四，要严格控制工人业余时间。在党委统一领导下，规定固定的业余活动时间，制止随意加班加点的现象。保安设备较差的矿场必须增设必要的保安设备，改善劳动条件。
    煤矿安全生产是长期而艰巨的工作，困难是一定会有的。但我们也应该看到今天已具备了做好安全生产的有利条件：技术设备已比过去好得多，几年来已积累了丰富的安全生产的经验，群众的觉悟也大大提高了。只要我们下定决心，善于依靠广大群众，学习苏联先进经验，积极向事故作斗争，我们就能够战胜一切困难，保证安全地完成和超额完成生产计划。
