Xinhua News Agency, September 19th: TASS Moscow Dispatch: “Izvestia” published an editorial on the 19th entitled "Great Friendship," commenting on the fact that Zhang Wentian, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, paid a visit to Soviet Minister Council Chairman Malenkov to present the telegram from Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, thanking the Soviet Union for its assistance to China's economic construction. The editorial first described the achievements made by the Chinese people in the political and economic fields in recent years, and then pointed out that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are transforming their great motherland. In building a new life, the Chinese people rely on the support of the entire peace, democracy, and socialist camp, and on the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union.

The editorial said: All Soviet people were very excited when they read in the newspapers about the meeting between G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, and Zhang Wentian, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Union, and the telegram from Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. This new and vivid proof of the further consolidation of the great friendship between the two great peoples once again shows what a powerful and vigorous force the new, historically unprecedented relationship between the countries of the socialist camp, and between China and the Soviet Union, is. This relationship is based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and the principles of equality and friendly cooperation. Concern for mutual interests, a sincere desire for mutual assistance and the achievement of common economic upsurge - all these guarantee the continuous growth and strengthening of the democratic camp. The ties of great and unbreakable friendship link the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies together. The democratic camp is not divided by internal contradictions and struggles. This is the fundamental difference between it and the relations between the countries of the imperialist camp, and one of its decisive advantages.

Soviet-Chinese relations are an outstanding example of brotherly cooperation among the countries of the democratic camp. Year after year, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China consolidate their mutual economic, political and cultural ties, implement the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in February 1950, and the recent agreements reached between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Millions of pieces of equipment, machines, raw materials, and supplies are being shipped from the Soviet Union to China. Soviet-Chinese joint ventures are carrying out their work on the basis of complete equality between both sides. The long-term loans granted by the Soviet Union to the People's Republic of China on the most preferential terms are promoting the increasing stability of China's financial and economic situation. At the end of last year, the Soviet Union transferred its rights to jointly manage the Chinese Changchun Railway and all its properties without compensation to the government of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people are effectively adopting Soviet scientific and technological experience and receiving assistance from Soviet experts. Mutually beneficial trade relations between China and the Soviet Union are becoming more and more active. Cultural ties between the Soviet Union and China are constantly growing and expanding.

There is no doubt that the implementation of the agreement on the Soviet Union's assistance to the economic construction of the People's Republic of China will help further develop and industrialize the Chinese economy, and it is a great step forward in consolidating Sino-Soviet friendship.

The editorial pointed out: On October 1st, the Chinese people, together with all progressive humanity, will celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In just four short years, the face of China has changed beyond recognition. It has become a great and independent democratic country; regardless of all the plots of imperialist aggression, it is moving forward confidently along the path of progress.

The editorial concluded: The Soviet people warmly congratulate the great Chinese people on their historic victory. May the friendship between the Soviet Union and China be further consolidated, and may the friendship between the Soviet Union and China further contribute to the interests of the two countries and to the cause of peace and security for all peoples!

    苏联“消息报”评中苏两国人民的伟大友谊
    指出这是民主阵营各国兄弟合作杰出范例
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“消息报”十九日以“伟大的友谊”为题发表社论，评论中国驻苏联大使张闻天谒见苏联部长会议主席马林科夫，呈递中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志感谢苏联对中国经济建设援助的电文一事。社论首先叙述了中国人民几年来在政治和经济方面所获得的成就，接着指出：中国人民在中国共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的中央人民政府领导下改造着自己的伟大祖国。中国人民在建设新的生活中，依靠着整个和平、民主与社会主义阵营的支持，依靠着苏联的兄弟般的援助。
    社论说：全体苏联人民在读到报纸上发表的关于苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫接见中华人民共和国驻苏联大使张闻天的消息和中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志的电报后，感到十分兴奋。两国伟大人民伟大友谊进一步巩固的这一新的、鲜明的证明，又一次地表明：社会主义阵营各国之间的、中国和苏联之间的崭新的、历史上从未有过的关系，是一种多么强大的、蓬勃的力量。这种关系是建立在无产阶级国际主义原则和平等、友好合作的原则的基础上的。对于相互利益的关心，对于相互援助和达到共同经济高涨的真诚愿望——所有这一切保证着民主阵营各国的不断成长和壮大。伟大的和牢不可破的友谊的纽带，把苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家连结在一起。民主阵营不受内部矛盾和斗争的分裂。这就是它和帝国主义阵营各国之间的关系的原则性的区别，也是它的具有决定意义的优越性之一。
    苏中关系乃是民主阵营各国之间的兄弟合作的杰出范例。苏联和中华人民共和国一年复一年地巩固着相互的经济、政治和文化的联系，执行着一九五○年二月签订的友好同盟互助条约以及苏联和中华人民共和国之间最近达成的协议。数以百万计的装备、机器、原料和物资正从苏联运往中国。苏中合营的公司在双方完全平等的基础上，展开着自己的工作。苏联在最优惠的条件下给予中华人民共和国的长期贷款，促进着中国财政经济情况的日益稳定。去年年底，苏联把自己关于共同管理中国长春铁路及其所属的一切财产的权利，无偿地交给了中华人民共和国政府。中国人民正有成效地采用苏联科学技术经验，获得苏联专家的帮助。中国和苏联的互利的贸易关系越来越活跃。苏中的文化联系不断地增长和扩大。
    毫无疑问，关于苏联援助中华人民共和国的经济建设事业问题的协定的执行，将有助于中国经济进一步发展和走向工业化，它是在巩固中苏友好的道路上大大地跨进了一步。
    社论指出：十月一日，中国人民、以及和中国人民在一起的全体进步人类，将庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年纪念。在短短的四年当中，中国的面貌改变得使人不能认识了。它已变成了一个伟大的和独立的民主国家；不顾帝国主义侵略的一切阴谋，满怀信心地沿着进步的道路前进。
    社论最后说：苏联人民热烈祝贺伟大的中国人民的历史胜利。祝苏中友谊更加巩固，祝苏中友谊更加有助于两国的利益和更加有利于各国人民的和平与安全的事业！
