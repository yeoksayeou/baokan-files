Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 23rd: Today, two more Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, who were not subject to direct repatriation, broke through the control of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents during the transfer to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and requested immediate repatriation to their homeland. One of these two prisoners of war was being held separately by Indian troops in a small tent behind the tent where reporters were observing. When the reporter walked out of the observation tent, he happened to see this prisoner of war. He gave the reporter a cordial salute and excitedly shouted in Shandong dialect: "I just arrived today!"

Today, a total of one thousand and ninety-seven non-directly repatriated personnel from our side were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody. Among them, there were nine hundred and thirty-five prisoners of the Korean People's Army and one hundred and sixty-two prisoners of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. All of them are sick and wounded. However, Chiang Kai-shek and Li Cheng-man agents are also tightly controlling these sick and wounded personnel. When they entered the camp in groups of eight or nine, it was very obvious that the first and last person in each group were physically strong and special individuals completely different from ordinary sick and wounded prisoners of war. They checked the number of people, drove everyone to keep up with the team, and shouted reactionary slogans in isolation. These people all wore special markings on their arms. In the ranks of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war, some special individuals openly wore black cloth armbands sewn with two large white characters: "Commander."

At around 11:00 a.m. today, agents masquerading as prisoners of war refused to send the prisoners of war to various wards according to the classification of diseases, hindering the normal progress of the handover work. These agents were obviously afraid that dispersing the prisoners of war would weaken their control over them.

The simple medical record of our sick and wounded prisoners of war handed over by the U.S. side to the Indian custodial troops shows how cruelly these sick and wounded personnel were abused and tortured in the U.S. prisoner of war camps. Among the one thousand and ninety-seven sick and wounded prisoners of war, eight hundred and fifty suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for 77.48% of the total; eighty-seven suffered from mental illness, accounting for 7.9% of the total. Everyone knows that only under extremely harsh living conditions and extremely cruel persecution can there be so many and such a large proportion of tuberculosis and mental illness patients.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 22nd: Among the Korean People's Army prisoners of war handed over by the U.S. side to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody on the 22nd, another one broke through the control of the agents and requested repatriation, and has been placed in separate custody by the Neutral Nations custodial troops.

The second batch of prisoners of war who entered the camp this morning refused to be inspected by Indian soldiers, causing the entire handover of prisoners of war to be suspended for about half an hour. An Indian officer said that these prisoners of war "simply refused the inspection without any reason." At this time, the reporter saw through binoculars that there were two U.S. military personnel and one Syngman Rhee puppet army personnel at the location inside the camp where the prisoners of war were inspected.

In the morning, when the prisoners of war walked into the camp through the passage in front of the Korean-Chinese observer representatives, an agent shouted: "Raise your flags high!" But the prisoners of war did not react. Another agent shouted: "Throw stones at them!" Still no response. The agent shouted again: "Shout slogans!" "Sing!" But none of them worked. Although the prisoners of war were all forced to hold Syngman Rhee's Taegeukgi flag, most of them focused their eyes on the Korean-Chinese observer representatives, and many even smiled especially at the observer representatives of the Korean People's Army.

In the afternoon, as the prisoners of war had all entered the camp and were living completely according to the original U.S. establishment, the agents tightly controlled the prisoners of war again. They drove the prisoners of war out of their tents to gather in front of the barbed wire and forced them to insult the Korean-Chinese observer representatives. But it could be clearly seen that only a few people in the front were commanding and roaring loudly, while most of the people in the back were just shaking their flags and shouting weakly.

As the explanation work is about to begin, the U.S. side is intensifying its conspiracy to sabotage the explanation work and forcibly detain prisoners of war through agents among the prisoners of war, so that it has become increasingly difficult for the Indian troops guarding the prisoners of war to maintain normal order in the camp.

### 我方被俘人员又有三名要求立即返回祖国  美方利用李蒋特务加紧布置破坏解释工作

    我方被俘人员又有三名要求立即返回祖国
    美方利用李蒋特务加紧布置破坏解释工作
    【新华社开城二十三日电】今天，又有两个不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员在移交给中立国遣返委员会的过程中，突破蒋匪特务的控制要求立即遣返回国。这两个我方被俘人员中的一个被印度部队单独看管在记者进行观察的帐篷后面的一个小帐篷里。记者走出观察帐篷时，正好看见这个我方被俘人员。他向记者亲切地行举手礼，并用山东话兴奋地叫道：“我是今天刚到的！”
    今天，一共有一千零九十七名不直接遣返的我方被俘人员移交给中立国遣返委员会看管。其中朝鲜人民军被俘人员九百三十五名，中国人民志愿军被俘人员一百六十二名。他们全部是病伤人员。但是，蒋李特务分子同样严密地控制着这些病伤人员。当他们分成八、九个人一个小组进入营场时，可以很明显地看出：每个小组最前的和最后的一个人都是身体健壮与一般病伤战俘完全不同的特殊人物。他们检查人数，赶逐着每个人跟上队，孤独地喊着反动口号。这些人的臂上都佩有特殊的标志。在朝鲜人民军被俘人员的行列中，有些特殊人物的臂上公然带着缝着两个白色大字：“指挥”的黑布袖章。
    今天上午十一点钟左右，冒充战俘的特务分子竟拒绝把战俘按照疾病的分类分别送到各种病房里去，阻碍了交接工作的正常进行。这些特务分子显然是害怕战俘分散以后，会削弱他们对战俘的控制。
    从美方交给印度看管部队的我方被俘人员的简单的病情表就可以看出：这些我方病伤人员在美方战俘营内是遭受了多么残酷的虐待和折磨。在一千零九十七个我方病伤被俘人员中，有八百五十人患肺结核，占总数百分之七十七点四八；八十七人患精神病，占总数百分之七点九。大家知道：只有在极端恶劣的生活条件和极端残酷的迫害下，才会有这么多和占这么大比例的肺结核患者和精神病患者。
    【新华社开城二十二日电】二十二日美方移交给中立国遣返委员会看管的朝鲜人民军被俘人员中，又有一名突破特务控制要求遣返，已由中立国看管部队予以单独看管。
    今天上午进入营场的第二批战俘拒绝接受印度士兵的检查，使得整个交接战俘的工作停顿了半小时左右。一个印度军官说：这些战俘“干脆拒绝检查，没有任何理由”。这时，记者从望远镜中看见在营场内部检查战俘的地点有两个美军人员和一个李承晚伪军人员。
    上午，在战俘们走进营场通过朝中观察代表前面的通道时，一个特务叫喊道：“把你的旗子高举起来！”可是战俘们没有反应。又一个特务喊道：“用石头扔他们！”仍旧没有反应。特务又喊：“喊口号！”“唱歌！”但是都没有效果。战俘们虽然都被迫拿着李承晚的太极旗，但是他们大部分都把眼光集中在朝中观察代表身上，许多人还特别向朝鲜人民军的观察代表微笑。
      到了下午，由于战俘们都进了营场，完全按照美方原来的编制居住，特务们又严密地控制了战俘。他们把战俘赶出帐篷来集合在铁丝网前，强迫他们向朝中观察代表辱骂。但是可以清楚地看到，只有少数几个人在前面指挥和使劲地咆哮，后面的大部分人却只是在那里有气无力地摇动着旗子叫喊。
    由于解释工作即将开始，美方正在通过战俘中的特务分子加紧进行他们破坏解释工作和强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，以致看管战俘的印度部队已经越来越难以维持营场内的正常秩序了。
