    All-China Federation of Trade Unions Calls on Workers Nationwide
    to Further Launch Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    [Report from this newspaper] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued an urgent notice on September 15 regarding further launching the labor emulation drive of increasing production and practicing economy to guarantee the comprehensive completion of the national production plan. The full text is as follows:
    This year is the first year of our great motherland's implementation of the Five-Year Construction Plan. For the past eight months, trade union organizations at all levels, under the leadership of the Communist Party committees at all levels, have organized labor emulation drives in state-owned and local state-owned industries across the country, achieving considerable success in industrial production, transportation, and capital construction. The total industrial output value for the first half of this year has fulfilled the national plan. However, it must be pointed out that a comprehensive inspection according to the national plan reveals that the completion of production tasks from January to August this year is not satisfactory. This is mainly manifested in uneven production, with some industrial products not fulfilling the plan, some products being of poor quality, some departments not completing the cost reduction plan, and many accidents occurring. The main reasons for these phenomena are the failure to truly rely on and mobilize the broad masses of workers, grasp the main links in production, implement planned management in a step-by-step manner, formulate and implement work plans, and establish and improve the production responsibility system. Some leading cadres still harbor a degree of blind complacency, leading to conservatism or blind adventurism, and their leadership of the competition is impractical, resulting in formalism. They have not earnestly discovered and promoted advanced experiences, nor have they promptly educated the workers to raise their class consciousness, enabling them to give play to their initiative and consciously abide by labor discipline. If this situation is not corrected promptly with appropriate measures, it will affect the comprehensive completion of the national production plan for the whole year. Completing the national production plan for 1953 is an important beginning for fulfilling the Five-Year Construction Plan and realizing national industrialization. However, nearly three-quarters of 1953 has passed, and many heavy tasks must be completed in the fourth quarter, making the time very pressing. At the same time, this year's agricultural production cannot reach the planned output due to disasters in certain regions, which further increases the importance of increasing production and practicing economy. Therefore, trade union organizations at all levels must educate all workers, technicians, and staff to fully recognize the seriousness of this issue, mobilize urgently, increase production, practice strict economy, and guarantee the comprehensive completion and strive for over-completion of the national plan, taking this as their current primary task.
    Our working class, during the period of national economic recovery in the motherland, overcame various difficulties with a heroic attitude, unwavering perseverance, and a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, launched patriotic labor emulation drives, and completed the great historical task of the economic recovery period, creating favorable conditions for the motherland's planned economic construction. Today, with the start of planned economic construction, our working class should be even more confident and devote themselves to selfless labor to complete the new historical tasks entrusted to us by our great motherland. To this end, trade union organizations at all levels should quickly and deeply mobilize the masses of workers, further launch the labor emulation drive of increasing production and practicing economy, give play to the initiative of the masses of workers, tap the potential of enterprises, strive to increase production, improve product quality, conserve raw materials, reduce product costs, and pay attention to safe production, prevent various accidents, and continuously improve labor productivity and enterprise management level, to guarantee the comprehensive completion and strive for over-completion of the national plan, create more wealth for the country, and accumulate more funds for the realization of national industrialization.
    In deeply organizing the labor emulation drive of increasing production and practicing economy, trade union organizations at all levels should organize the study of relevant policy documents, conduct in-depth inspections of the mass production work of the past eight months, summarize the experiences and lessons of the labor emulation drive, and improve the leadership of mass production work. Trade union organizations in various industries and regions should, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, assist the administration in researching and proposing specific targets for increasing production and practicing economy for their respective industries and regions, based on different situations. Trade union grassroots organizations should also, based on the requirements of the national plan, analyze the actual situation of enterprises, identify the key problems existing in current production, and realistically determine specific requirements for increasing production and practicing economy for the entire factory, workshops, and each team, and formulate competition conditions. In private enterprises, labor-management consultation should also be used to adopt practical and feasible methods to strive to increase production, improve product quality, reduce costs, and implement the policy of "developing production, prospering the economy, benefiting both public and private sectors, and benefiting both labor and capital," based on specific circumstances.
    Trade union organizations at all levels must continue to publicize the political and economic significance of the national production plan to the masses of workers, so that every worker clearly understands the requirements of the country and the specific targets of increasing production and practicing economy in their units; and frequently conduct political and ideological education and education on consolidating labor discipline for the masses of workers, especially for new workers, so that the masses of workers strengthen their sense of responsibility as masters of the country, establish and consolidate a new labor attitude; they must also constantly understand the ideological trends of the masses of workers, discover and disseminate advanced ideas in a timely manner, and continuously wage struggles against conservative ideas, economism, and various erroneous ideas, so that they consciously strive to complete the various targets of the national construction plan.
    At the same time, trade union organizations at all levels must continue to assist the administration in strengthening planning management and technical management, establishing and improving various responsibility systems, further consolidating labor discipline, and overcoming the current phenomena of uneven production, low quality, many accidents, lack of responsibility, and various waste in industrial production and capital construction. It is necessary to check the progress of the competition on time, discover and support all progressive initiatives of the masses of workers, summarize and promote advanced experiences, announce achievements, and assist the enterprise administration in doing a good job of rewarding work. On the principle of necessity and possibility, attention should be paid to improving the working conditions of workers and solving the urgent problems in their current lives. Only on this basis can the initiative and creativity of the broad masses of workers be brought into full play, and can a huge force for improving labor productivity be truly formed.
    Various industrial trade unions, offices of large administrative regions, and federations of trade unions in provinces and cities should strictly implement the provisions of the reporting system, and report the measures and plans for increasing production and practicing economy in the fourth quarter, the situation and experience in launching the labor emulation drive of increasing production and practicing economy to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in a timely manner.

    中华全国总工会号召全国工人
    进一步开展增产节约竞赛
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会在九月十五日发出关于进一步开展增产节约劳动竞赛保证全面地完成国家生产计划的紧急通知，全文如下：
    今年是我们伟大祖国实行五年建设计划的第一个年度。八个月来，工会各级组织在中共各级党委领导之下，在全国各地国营和地方国营工业中组织了劳动竞赛，在工业生产、交通运输、基本建设等方面都获得了不少成绩。今年上半年的工业总产值是完成了国家计划的。但是，必须指出，按照国家计划作全面的检查，则今年一至八月生产任务的完成情况并不好。这主要表现在生产不均衡，有几种工业产品没有完成计划，有些产品质量不好，有些部门没有完成降低成本的计划，并且事故很多。造成这些现象的主要原因在于没有认真依靠和发动广大工人群众，抓住生产中的主要环节，有步骤地贯彻计划管理，订立和执行作业计划，建立和健全生产责任制。有些领导干部还多少存在着盲目自满情绪，形成保守或盲目冒进现象，对竞赛的领导不切实际，产生形式主义现象，没有认真发现和推广先进经验，没有及时教育工人群众提高阶级觉悟，使工人群众发挥积极性并自觉地遵守劳动纪律。这一情况如不采取适当措施，迅速扭转，势将影响今年全年国家生产计划的全面完成。而完成一九五三年的国家生产计划是完成五年建设计划、实现国家工业化的一个重要开端。可是一九五三年已过去近四分之三，许多繁重任务须在第四季度完成，时间十分紧迫。同时，今年由于某些地区遭受灾害，使农业生产不能达到预定的产量，这就更加重了增产节约的重要性。因此，工会各级组织必须教育全体工人、技术人员、职员充分认识这一问题的严重性，紧急动员起来，增加生产，厉行节约，保证全面完成并争取超额完成国家计划，把这作为自己的当前的首要任务。
    我们工人阶级在祖国的国民经济恢复时期，曾以英雄的姿态、坚忍不拔的毅力、高度的爱国主义热忱克服了各种困难，开展了爱国主义劳动竞赛，完成了经济恢复时期的伟大的历史任务，为祖国有计划的经济建设创造了有利条件。在有计划的经济建设开始了的今天，我们工人阶级更应该满怀信心地以忘我的劳动精神，完成伟大祖国交予我们的新的历史任务。为此，工会各级组织应迅速地深入地发动工人群众，进一步开展增产节约劳动竞赛，发挥工人群众的积极性，挖掘企业潜力，努力增加生产，提高产品质量，节约原料、材料，降低产品成本，并注意安全生产，防止各种事故，不断地提高劳动生产率和企业管理水平，保证全面地完成并争取超额完成国家计划，为国家创造更多的财富，为实现国家工业化积累更多的资金。
    在深入组织增产节约劳动竞赛中，工会各级组织应组织学习有关政策文件，深入检查八个月来的群众生产工作，总结劳动竞赛的经验教训，改进对群众生产工作的领导。各产业、各地区的工会组织应在中国共产党的领导下，根据不同的情况，协助行政研究并提出本产业、本地区的增产节约的具体指标。工会基层组织也应根据国家计划的要求，分析企业的实际情况，找出当前生产中存在的关键问题，实事求是地确定对全厂、车间以及每个小组的增产节约的具体要求，订出竞赛条件。在私营企业中也应通过劳资协商，根据具体情况，采取切实可行的办法，努力增加生产，提高产品质量，降低成本，贯彻“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的政策。
    工会各级组织必须继续向工人群众宣传国家生产计划在政治和经济上的意义，使每个工人都明确了解国家的要求和本单位增产节约的具体指标；并经常对工人群众特别是对新工人进行政治思想教育和巩固劳动纪律的教育，使工人群众加强国家主人翁的责任感，树立和巩固新的劳动态度；还要随时了解工人群众的思想动态，及时地发现并传播先进思想，不断地向保守思想、经济主义思想及各种错误思想进行斗争，使他们自觉地为完成国家建设计划的各项指标而奋斗。
    同时，工会各级组织必须继续协助行政加强计划管理和技术管理，建立和健全各种责任制度，进一步巩固劳动纪律，克服目前工业生产和基本建设中存在的生产不均衡、质量低、事故多、无人负责和各种浪费的现象。必须按时检查竞赛的进行情况，发现和支持工人群众一切进步的倡议，总结和推广先进经验，公布成绩并协助企业行政做好奖励工作。在必要和可能的原则下，注意改善工人的劳动条件，解决当前生活上的迫切问题。只有在这样的基础上，才能高度发挥广大工人群众的积极性和创造性，才能真正形成提高劳动生产率的巨大力量。
    各产业工会、大行政区办事处及省、市工会联合会，应严格执行报告制度的规定，将第四季度增产节约的措施计划，开展增产节约劳动竞赛的情况和经验，及时报告中华全国总工会。
