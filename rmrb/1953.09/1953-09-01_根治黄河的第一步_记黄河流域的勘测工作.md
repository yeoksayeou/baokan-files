The first planned and large-scale surveying and mapping work in the Yellow River Basin in our country's history has begun. This is the first step in our country's great historical project to fundamentally transform the Yellow River. People will further explore the natural conditions and laws of the Yellow River through detailed surveying and mapping work, and grasp accurate data as the basis for formulating a fundamental Yellow River harnessing project plan. With the victory of great water conservancy projects such as the Huai River harnessing, the Chinese people are now able to put the historical task of fundamentally harnessing the Yellow River and transforming the "harmful river" into a "beneficial river" on the agenda of their construction work. ×××

The Yellow River is a great river in our country. It originates from the southern foothills of the Bayan Har Mountains in western Qinghai, flows through eight provinces in central China, and enters the Bohai Sea. It is more than 4,800 kilometers long, almost equal to twice the length of Europe's famous Danube River. Just as the famous Chinese song "Ode to the Yellow River" sings: it is the cradle of our nation and the birthplace of Chinese culture. It contains infinitely rich resources for us to develop and utilize.

However, due to its own special natural conditions, namely the characteristics of "abundant soil, steep slopes, few trees, and rapid rainfall," the Yellow River has brought many serious disasters to the Chinese people, especially floods. For thousands of years, it has swallowed countless lives and properties. According to historical records, the Yellow River has breached its banks more than 1,500 times. In the more than 4,000 years since Yu the Great, the Yellow River has breached its banks on average more than once every two years, including six major floods that completely changed the course of the entire Yellow River. The casualties of people and livestock in many historical floods were extremely shocking. During the tenth year of the Zhenghe period of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, one breach alone drowned more than one million people. In the fifteenth year of the Chongzhen period of the Ming Dynasty, the Yellow River washed away the city walls of Kaifeng, and 340,000 of the city's 370,000 people were buried in the Yellow River. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Yellow River breached its banks almost every year. The great flood caused by Chiang Kai-shek's breaching of the Huayuankou dyke in 1938 is well known. The result of this flood was that thousands of miles of fertile land in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu became a scorched Yellow River flood area. According to the Kuomintang government's obviously reduced statistics, 320,000 people drowned.

The Yellow River not only caused floods, but also brought droughts and soil erosion. The Yellow River Basin has little rainfall. Its total annual flow is only one-fourteenth of the Yangtze River, but the riverbed is very steep and the water flow is very rapid. The water quickly flows into the sea, making it impossible for the farmland along the coast to use it for irrigation. Soil erosion is also a special disaster of the Yellow River. Because most of the 770,000 square kilometers of the Yellow River Basin are loess areas, the Yellow River constantly erodes the banks of the upper reaches through its countless tributaries, washing 1.26 billion tons of sediment into the water every year. The cultivated land on both sides has lost a large amount of organic matter necessary for plant growth due to continuous erosion, and the land has become increasingly barren. Millions of farmers who depend on the land for their livelihoods have become increasingly impoverished. The large amount of sediment entering the Yellow River has resulted in a sudden decrease in the slope of the downstream, and the riverbed has been silting up day by day. It is estimated that it silts up by an average of 2 centimeters every year. Floods, droughts, and soil erosion are the three major disasters of the Yellow River. Due to the corruption and incompetence of the feudal rulers of our country in the past, the Yellow River has not been effectively harnessed for a long time, and these three major disasters have continued to increase over the centuries.

After liberation, the Central People's Government vigorously carried out the work of harnessing the Yellow River, strengthened the dikes along the coast, and built flood detention, ice prevention, water diversion, and irrigation projects such as Shitou Village, Xiaojiezi, and the Yellow River Diversion to Jiwei in the lower reaches, reducing the severity of the Yellow River flood disasters and opening up the road to using the Yellow River's water power in the lower reaches. Although these projects have played a great role in preventing flood disasters, they cannot fundamentally solve the Yellow River problem. Floods and droughts still threaten the people on both sides of the Yellow River. ×××

Fundamentally harnessing the Yellow River is a complex task. First, it is necessary to thoroughly understand the Yellow River Basin and other relevant conditions and master accurate and reliable data. Therefore, surveying and mapping work has been placed in a primary position.

Since 1950, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission of the Ministry of Water Resources and the Hydropower Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry have carried out a lot of surveying and mapping work in the Yellow River Basin. From August to December last year, three survey teams were organized for the Yellow River source section (above the Yellow River along), the Gui-Ning section (from Guide to Ningxia), and the Tuo-Long section (from Tuoketuo to Longmen) to survey the most complex and least understood parts of the Yellow River's main stream. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission also organized the Haikou survey team, which surveyed the part of the Yellow River entering the sea in September last year.

The Yellow River survey work was carried out under extremely complex and difficult conditions. The source of the Yellow River and the Gui-Ning section and Tuo-Long section are all in the sparsely populated upper reaches of the Yellow River. Some are the turbulent and dangerous Yellow River canyons, some are plateaus thousands of meters above sea level with thin air, and some are vast grasslands where no people can be seen for hundreds of miles. When the staff of the Yellow River Source Survey Team walked on the uninhabited Qinghai grassland, all they saw all day long were herds of wild cattle, wild sheep, and bears. They picked up cow dung for fuel during the day and slept in tents at night. The weather changed several times a day. It was warm at noon, but in the afternoon, sand and rocks flew and hail fell. At night, the temperature often dropped to minus 20 or 30 degrees Celsius. When they passed through plateaus more than 4,100 meters above sea level, the air was too thin, and they would get breathless and dizzy when walking, so they could only climb on livestock all day long; and they had to walk twice a day, unloading the tents twice during rest, and tidying up the luggage twice. Resting twice was not a big deal, but it was necessary to bend over to do these things, and people could not breathe after bending over, so they had to rest several times in between each time they tidied up the luggage. The most troublesome thing on the road was eating, because the air pressure was too low, the rice could not be cooked thoroughly, and the water boiled at 60 or 70 degrees Celsius. The cooked noodles were always sticky, and when eating, they had to use a teacup to cook on a cow dung fire for a while before eating.

Many places in the upper reaches of the Yellow River are dangerous shoals with turbulent waves. The Yellow River, sandwiched between the two mountains, continuously impacts the steep rocks on both sides, making a continuous thunder-like sound, which can be heard several miles away. From the upstream of Guide to Lanzhou, there are as many as 13 such canyons, and there are also 6 above Lanzhou. These dangerous canyons are tens of miles long, and the short ones are one or two kilometers long. If the geological structure is good, these dangerous canyons are often the best sites for good hydropower generation dams. Of course, the survey personnel cannot miss these places, but how to carry out measurement work in the turbulent mountain canyons is a big problem. The crossing tools in these places are very primitive. One is called the "cowhide bag," which is the cowhide dried after slaughtering the cow's head and taking out the bones and meat. When crossing the river, the upper and lower openings are tightened, and air is blown into it from one foot. After the air is full, it is dragged into the river, and the four feet face the sky, turning it into a boat. The person crossing the river drills into the dark cow belly, and the sailor climbs on the cowhide bag, using his hands and feet to paddle the water at the same time to make the boat move forward. Another crossing tool is called "wa," which is a dugout canoe made by digging a hole in half a large tree trunk. This kind of boat travels on the rapids, and the waves constantly splash into the "wa" trough, which can easily capsize the "wa." There is also a sheepskin raft, which is made of sheepskin and wood. The survey staff used these primitive tools to work in the dangerous shoals of the Yellow River, fighting against the turbulent waves, and carefully recorded all the information that could serve the construction of the motherland.

The survey staff not only need to thoroughly understand the situation of the Yellow River itself, but also need to understand the nearby social and economic conditions, geological topography, transportation conditions, and the acquisition of engineering materials. Because the construction of reservoirs and hydropower stations must obtain these data at the same time, the survey staff must work in many steep mountain valleys on both sides of the Yellow River. The staff of the Tuo-Long Section Survey Team conducted on-site surveys in a continuous 600-kilometer canyon. They climbed over one mountain after another, and the stones scratched their skin, and the sour jujube thorns tore their clothes. Sometimes the slope of the cliff was too steep, so they grabbed the cliffs and grass trees and climbed up, and sometimes they climbed through the gaps in the weathered shale layers. In winter, the north wind howled, and the Yellow River had frozen. They walked along the ice edges of the river, and if they were not careful, they would fall into the ice cave. Many of the surveyed places were uninhabited areas, and it was impossible to find someone to lead the way or find a place to stay. The staff of the Gui-Ning Section Survey Team could not find a place to live when surveying the longitudinal section of Longyang Gorge in Qinghai, so they had to drill into the rock caves by the river to stay overnight.

But the biggest difficulty was not these. When the survey staff passed through the Qinghai grassland and headed towards the Yellow River along, they came to a place called "Bitter Sea" and "Drunken Horse Beach." This was really a place full of mythical atmosphere. The so-called "Bitter Sea" is a large area of water, the water is deep blue, and it looks very beautiful, but the taste is bitter, and people and livestock will die immediately after eating it. The grass and trees on the edge of the Bitter Sea are sparse and withered all year round, which is said to be affected by the water. "Drunken Horse Beach" grows a dense and bright patch of wild grass. These grasses are poisonous, and horses will get drunk and fall down immediately after eating them. There is also a kind of wild garlic on "Drunken Horse Beach," which will blind people if they eat it. The "Bitter Sea" and "Drunken Horse Beach" are about 100 miles long in total. People and horses cannot stay in this area. They must rush through this place on horseback on the same day before they can rest.

Many places in the upper reaches of the Yellow River are inhabited by ethnic minorities in our country. These ethnic minorities were driven into the high mountain valleys by the remnants of the Ma Bufang bandits in the past and lived a very poor life; it was not until after liberation that the brilliance of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy shone here, and their lives began to improve. Almost everyone in the ethnic minority people in many villages has a commemorative badge of Chairman Mao, which they respectfully wear on their chest or hat. Some Tibetans even hang Chairman Mao's portrait together with the Buddha on their necks to express their gratitude. Wherever the survey team went, they received their warm help. They helped the survey team buy cattle and sheep, buy ghee, and act as guides to lead the way, solving many major difficult problems.

Where is the real source of the Yellow River? This has always been a mystery in the past. When the survey team climbed mountains and waded through rivers to the southern foothills of the Bayan Har Mountains, the scene in front of them also confused them. The continuous high mountains were covered with white snow, shining with dazzling white light. Clear water flowed潺潺 from the mountain gullies in all directions, and converged in all directions. Which source of water is the real source of the Yellow River? They had to ask the local Tibetans. Later, the Tibetans sang a local folk song to the survey team. The content of this song is: Where does the Yellow River water come from?

Yakuzonglie; Where is the old home of the Yakuzonglie Canal?

Yahe La Daheze.

This folk song pointed out the way for the survey team to find the source of the river, so they went up again to find Yakuzonglie, and finally reached the real source of the Yellow River, the Yakuzonglie Canal, which is a pot-shaped basin where water emerges from the ground everywhere, forming countless small pools, and gradually countless small streams converge together. To the west here is the main peak of "Yahe La Daheze," which is a large mountain more than 5,400 meters high. The water flowing south from here flows into the Tongtian River in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River and the Yellow River are hundreds of miles apart in the lower reaches, but here they are close at hand. The survey team found the real source of the Yellow River, and everyone was very happy. They erected a stone on the top of the mountain, inscribed with the four characters "Stone of the Source of the River," to commemorate the victory of their survey work. ×××

The infinite enthusiasm for building the motherland encouraged the survey staff to carry out their work without fear of hardship. One of the survey team members told me: When they think of the new look of the Yellow River Basin in the future, they have infinite courage and confidence.

What will the new look of the Yellow River Basin be in the future? This is undoubtedly a matter of concern to many people. In the past, many old scholars and technicians believed that it was impossible to fundamentally harness the Yellow River, and people could only forever be at the mercy of the Yellow River. At a flood control conference held in India in 1950, many water conservancy experts from capitalist countries studied the Yellow River problem. Their conclusion was: the Yellow River will engulf all the plains along the coast in 2,000 years, and the Yellow River Basin will become a lifeless desert area. They are pessimistic about the future of the Yellow River.

But the Chinese people have the greatest optimism about the future of the Yellow River. We believe that the Yellow River can be fundamentally harnessed. As early as 4,000 years ago, our great ancestor Yu the Great carried out the great task of harnessing the Yellow River with such an optimistic spirit, and finally maintained the Yellow River without changing its course for more than 1,600 years, setting the best example for future generations to govern the Yellow River. And today we have many favorable conditions in politics, economy, and so on. The staff participating in the survey of the Yellow River Basin are convinced that, without waiting for 2,000 years, as long as a few decades, or even a shorter period of time, the Yellow River Basin will appear in front of the Chinese people with a brand-new look. At that time, the yellow soil area of thousands of miles along the Yellow River will become an boundless green jungle, and the dense weeds will provide the best feed for the cattle and sheep on the Northwest Plateau. "Yellow River" will become a historical term, because after thousands of large and small reservoirs along the coast, the turbid yellow water will become clear blue water. Hydropower stations will appear on the Yellow River, illuminating the cities and villages on both sides, and starting the machines of many factories. The shipping industry of the Yellow River will be greatly developed. Large 3,000-ton freighters will travel upstream along the river directly to Zhengzhou, and large 500-ton steamboats will go directly to Lanzhou. They will transport cheap and high-quality daily necessities and cloths to the ethnic minority areas in the northwest in large quantities, and transport the famous northwest furs and medicinal materials to all parts of the country. The weather in the upper reaches of the Yellow River will no longer be dry and arid, and the climate will become humid and mild with the changes in the natural environment. The cold northwest will become as lovely as the south of our motherland, and thus crops will grow more luxuriantly than at any time in history. …

"As long as we work hard, this day will eventually come." The staff participating in the survey of the Yellow River Basin understand their current labor in this way, and use it to encourage themselves.

    根治黄河的第一步
    ——记黄河流域的勘测工作
    季音
    我国历史上第一次有计划的、较大规模的勘测黄河流域的工作，已经开始了。这是我国从根本上改造黄河这一伟大历史工程的第一步。人们将要通过详细的勘测工作进一步探明黄河的自然状况及其规律，掌握确切的资料，作为制订根治黄河工程计划的根据。随着治淮等伟大水利工程的胜利，现在中国人民已有可能把根本地治理黄河、把“害河”改造为“利河”的历史任务，摆到自己建设工作的日程上来了。×××
    黄河是我国一条伟大的河流，它发源于青海西部的巴颜喀喇山西麓的噶达素齐老山下，流过我国中部的八个省而入渤海，全长四千八百多公里，几乎相等于欧洲著名的多瑙河两条那么长。正如我国名歌“黄河颂”所歌唱的：它是我们民族的摇篮，我国文化的发源地。它蕴藏着无限丰富的资源，可供我们开发和利用。
    但黄河由于它本身的特殊自然条件，即“土多、坡陡、树少、雨急”的特点，给我国人民带来了许多严重的灾害，其中特别是水灾，几千年来，它不知曾吞没了多少人的生命和财产。从历代的记载来看，黄河决口有记录的共一千五百多次，大禹以后的四千多年来，黄河平均每二年多就要决口一次，其中有六次大泛滥，整个黄河河道都搬了家。历史上许多次水灾的人畜伤亡情况，是极其惊人的，宋徽宗政和十年时，一次决口就淹死了一百多万人。明崇祯十五年，黄水冲塌了开封城墙，全城三十七万人，有三十四万人全被埋葬在黄水里。在国民党反动统治时期，黄河几乎年年决口，一九三八年蒋介石扒决花园口堤防所造成的大水灾，更是人所共知的，这次水灾的结果是使河南、安徽、江苏千里沃野成了一片赤地的黄汛区，据国民党政府显然是缩小的统计数字，就淹死了三十二万人。
    黄河不仅造成水灾，也带来了旱灾和水土流失的灾害。黄河流域雨量少，它一年的总流量只等于长江的十四分之一，但河床很陡，水流很急，水迅速地就流到了海里，使得沿岸的农田无法利用它来灌溉。水土流失也是黄河一个特殊的灾害，因为黄河流域七十七万平方公里的面积绝大部分都是黄土地带，黄河通过了它的无数支流，整年冲刷着上游两岸，每年把十二亿六千万吨的泥砂冲到水里。两岸耕地经过不断的冲刷，失掉了大量植物生长所必需的有机质，土地愈来愈贫瘠了，靠土地为生的千百万农民也就日益陷入了贫困。而大量泥砂冲入黄河的结果，使得黄河的下游坡度突缓，河道一天天地淤积，河床不断加高，据估计，它每年平均要淤高二公寸。水灾，旱灾，水土流失，这就是黄河的三大灾害。由于我国历代封建统治者的腐败无能，长期没有对黄河进行有效的治理，这三大灾害千百年来始终是有增无减。
    解放后，中央人民政府曾大力开展了黄河的治导工作，加固了沿岸的堤防，并在下游建造了石头庄、小街子、引黄济卫等滞洪、防凌分水和灌溉工程，减轻了黄河洪水为害的严重性，开辟了在下游利用黄河水力的道路。这些工程对于防止洪水为害虽然有很大的作用，但还不能从根本上解决黄河问题，洪水和干旱仍然威胁着黄河两岸的人民。×××
    根治黄河是一项复杂的工作，首先必须彻底弄清黄河流域及其他有关情况，掌握精确可靠的资料。因此，勘测工作就被提到首要的地位上来了。
    从一九五○年开始，中央水利部黄河水利委员会和中央燃料工业部水电建设总局已在黄河流域进行了许多勘测工作。去年八月到十二月，又组织了黄河河源段（黄河沿以上），贵宁段（贵德至宁夏）及托龙段（托克托至龙门）三个查勘队，查勘了黄河干流上最复杂的、过去了解得最差的部分。黄河水利委员会又组织了海口查勘队，于去年九月查勘了黄河入海的部分。
    黄河查勘工作是在极其复杂艰险的情况下进行的。黄河河源和贵宁段、托龙段都在人迹罕见的黄河上游，有的是怒涛奔腾惊险异常的黄河峡谷，有的是拔海数千公尺空气稀薄的高原，有的是数百里内不见人烟的大草原。河源查勘队的工作人员在无人的青海草原上行走时，整日见到的只有成群的野牛、野羊和狗熊。他们白天拾牛粪作燃料，夜晚睡在帐篷里。天气一日数变，中午暖和，下午就飞沙走石，下冰雹，晚上温度常常降到零下二、三十度。他们经过拔海四千一百公尺以上的高原时，空气过于稀薄，步行就气喘头晕，只能整天爬在牲口上；而且每天要作两次走，休息时要两次下卸帐篷，两次整理行李。休息两次不打紧，可是做这些事都得弯下腰来，一弯腰人就喘不过气来，所以他们每整理一次行李，中间就得休息好几回。路途上最苦恼的是吃饭问题，因为气压太低，饭烧不熟，水到六、七十度就沸腾了，煮的面条总是黏的，吃饭的时候只好用茶缸在牛粪火上煮一会再吃。
    黄河上游许多地方都是惊涛骇浪的险滩，被夹在两山之间的黄河整日冲击着两岸峻峭的岩石，轰轰地连续发出雷鸣似的响声，数里外都可听到。从贵德上游起到兰州，这种峡谷就有十三个之多，兰州以上也有六个。这种峡谷长的达数十里，短的有一、二公里。这些惊险的峡谷，如果地质构造良好，往往就是最好的水力发电的优良坝址。这些地方查勘人员当然不能放过，但是如何在惊涛骇浪的山峡里进行测量工作，却是一个大问题。这些地方的渡河工具都是很原始的，有一种叫“牛皮袋”，即杀掉牛头，拿出骨肉以后晒干的牛皮。渡河时把上下口扎紧，从一只脚上向内吹气，气吹足后拖到河里，使四脚朝天，就成了一只船。渡河的人钻在黑洞洞的牛肚子里，水手爬在牛皮袋上，手脚同时划水，使船前进。另一种渡河工具叫做“瓦”，在半块大树干上挖一个洞而成的独木舟。这种船，行驶在急流上，浪花不断地泼进“瓦”槽里，很容易把“瓦”掀翻。还有一种羊皮筏子，是用羊皮和木头制成的。查勘工作人员就用这些原始工具在黄河险滩里工作着，与惊涛骇浪斗争着，把一切可以为祖国建设服务的资料都仔细地记录下来。
    查勘工作人员不仅要彻底弄清黄河本身的情况，而且它还需要了解附近的社会经济情况、地质地形、交通条件、工程材料的取得等等。因为建造水库和水力发电站，必须同时获得这些资料，因此查勘工作人员必须在黄河两岸的许多峻峭山谷里进行工作。托龙段查勘队的工作人员曾在连绵六百公里的峡谷里进行了实地勘测，他们爬过一个山头又是一个山头，石头擦破了皮肤，酸枣刺勾破了衣服。有时崖坡太陡，他们就抓住崖壁和草树，攀援而上，有时就从风化了的页岩层的空隙里爬过去。在冬天，北风怒号着，黄河已经冰冻了，他们就沿着河边的冰凌走，一不小心就会掉到冰窟里。有许多勘测的地方都是荒无人烟的地区，找不到人带路，也找不到地方歇宿，贵宁段查勘队的工作人员在青海龙羊峡勘测纵断面时，找不到地方住，晚上只好钻到河边的岩洞里住宿。
    但最大的困难还不是这些。勘测工作人员经过青海大草原向黄河沿前进时，曾经到过一个叫做
    “苦海”和“醉马滩”的地方，这真是一个充满着神话气氛的地方。所谓“苦海”就是一片大水，水是深蓝色的，看去很美丽，但味道苦涩，人和牲口吃了立刻就会死去。苦海边上的草木一年四季都是稀疏而萎枯的，据说也是受水的影响。“醉马滩”上长着一片茂密的鲜艳的野草，这些草都是有毒的，马吃了立即就会醉倒。“醉马滩”上还有一种野蒜，人吃了就会双目失明。而“苦海”和“醉马滩”两个地方共长达一百里左右，在这块地方人马不能停留，必须在当天快马加鞭地赶过这里，才能歇宿。
    黄河上游许多地方都是我国少数民族聚居处。这些少数民族过去在马步芳匪徒的残害下，被赶进了高山冷谷里，过着十分贫困的生活；直到解放后，毛主席民族政策的光辉照到了这里，他们的日子才开始好起来。许多村上的少数民族人民几乎人人都有一枚毛主席的纪念章，尊敬地戴在胸前或帽子上，有的藏民并把毛主席的像和自己脖子上的佛爷挂在一起，以此来表示感激。查勘队走到那里，都得到他们热诚的帮助，他们帮助查勘队买牛羊，买酥油，做向导带路，解决了许多重大的困难问题。
    真正的黄河河源在哪里？这在过去一直是个谜。当查勘队爬山涉水到达巴颜喀喇山北麓的噶达素齐老山下的时候，眼前的情景也使他们迷惘了，一片连绵的高山上积着白皑皑的雪，闪射着刺眼的白光，四面八方的山沟里潺潺地流出清澈的水，又汇流向各方，究竟那一枝水源才是真正的黄河河源呢？他们只好找当地的藏民来询问。后来藏民们给查勘队唱了一首当地流传的民歌，这歌的内容是：黄河水从那里来？
    约古宗列；约古宗列渠的老家在那里？
    雅合拉达合泽。
    这民歌给查勘队指明了寻找河源的道路，于是他们就再往上去找约古宗列，最后终于到达了真正的黄河河源约古宗列渠，那是一个锅形的盆地，水四处从地下冒出来，形成无数个小水池，渐渐地无数小水流又汇合在一起。这里再向西就是“雅合拉达合泽”主峰，这是一座五千四百多公尺高的大山，此处往南流的水，就流入了长江上游的通天河。长江与黄河在下游相距数百里，在这里却近在眼前。查勘队找到了真正的黄河河源，大家都高兴万分，他们在山顶上竖了一块石头，上刻“河源之石”四个大字，以纪念他们查勘工作的胜利。×××
    建设祖国的无限热情鼓舞着查勘工作人员不畏艰辛地去进行工作，他们以能够参加这个伟大的历史任务而自豪。一个查勘队员告诉我：当他们想到将来黄河流域的新面貌时，便有了无限的勇气和信心。
    将来的黄河流域将是怎样的新面貌呢？这无疑是许多人所关心的。过去许多旧学者和技术人员认为根治黄河是不可能实现的，人们只能永远听凭黄水的摆布。一九五○年在印度召开的一次防洪会议上，许多资本主义国家的水利专家们曾研究了黄河问题，他们研究的结论是：黄河在二千年以后将吞没沿岸的所有平原，黄河流域将成为一片毫无生机的大沙漠地带。他们对黄河的前途是悲观的。
    但中国人民对黄河前途的看法却抱着最大的乐观，我们认为黄河是可以根治的。远在四千年以前，我们伟大的祖先大禹就本着这样的乐观精神从事了伟大的治黄工作，终于使黄河维持了一千六百多年没有改道，给后代子孙树立了治理黄河的最好榜样。而今天我们已经具备了政治上、经济上等等许多有利条件。参加勘测黄河流域的工作人员们都坚信，毋须在二千年以后，只要数十年，甚至更短的时间，黄河流域就将以崭新的面貌出现在中国人民的面前。那时候，黄河沿岸千里赤地的黄土地带将成为一片无垠的绿色丛林，茂密的野草将使西北高原上的牛羊得到最好的饲料。“黄河”将成为历史名词了，因为通过沿岸千百座大小水库之后，浑浊的黄水将变成清澈的碧流。一座座的水电站将出现在黄河上，把两岸的城市和村庄照得一片雪亮，把许多工厂的机器开动起来。黄河的航运事业将大大发展，三千吨的大轮船将沿河上溯，直抵郑州，五百吨的大汽船将直达兰州，它们将把价廉物美的日用品和布匹大批地送到西北少数民族地区，而把闻名全国的西北皮毛和药材输送到全国各地。黄河上游的天气将不再是干燥亢旱的了，气候将随着自然环境的变化而变得潮湿而温和，寒冷的西北将变得像我们祖国江南一样的可爱，因而农作物也将比历史上任何时期都长得丰硕而茂盛。……
    “只要我们努力，这一天终会到来的。”参加勘测黄河流域的工作人员都这样地理解着他们今天进行着的劳动，并以此鼓励着自己。
