Concerning the Correction of Calculation Errors Regarding Nitrogen Content of Pig Manure from Soybean Cake Feeding in "The Chinese People Thank Soviet Agronomy Expert Lysenko"

    An article written in August 1952 by Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Pengyin, titled "The Chinese People Thank Soviet Agronomy Expert Lysenko" (see August 23, 1952 edition of this newspaper), quoted an erroneous translation record from the Ministry of Agriculture. It incorrectly stated that the nitrogen content of pig manure was 4-5 per thousand, instead of 2-3 percent, and based on this, provided an unrealistic explanation saying: "A pig eats about 500 jin of soybean cake per year, but produces 2 tons of manure. The nitrogen content of soybean cake is 6-7 percent, while the nitrogen content of pig manure is 2-3 percent. 500 jin of soybean cake only contains 35 jin of fertilizer. However, the two tons (4,000 jin) of pig manure obtained from feeding 500 jin of soybean cake to pigs contains 120 jin of nitrogen."

    When this article was published, we did not carefully proofread it, so we failed to correct this error. After the article was published, newspapers and periodicals in various regions quoted it, resulting in incorrect publicity among the peasant masses. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives even issued instructions based on this figure; the Northwest Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry also cited this material to notify agricultural and forestry agencies at all levels in the Northwest to vigorously promote it. Regarding such a scientific issue involving the production of the broad masses of peasants, we were initially careless, and when the reporter submitted this material to us for review, we did not ask experts to proofread it personally, and then we let it go and did not correct it in time. This shows that our bureaucratic style is serious. In order to clarify the understanding of this issue, we hereby explain as follows:

    Farm-accumulated farmyard manure and compost contain more organic matter, which has a significant effect on improving soil and cultivating soil fertility, and is the most basic fertilizer in agricultural production. Various oil cakes and chemical fertilizers can only supplement the deficiency of farm-accumulated fertilizers, and cannot replace farm-accumulated fertilizers. Therefore, promoting manure accumulation is the basic task to solve the current fertilizer shortage, especially raising pigs to accumulate manure.

    Directly using soybean cake as fertilizer is a great waste, because soybean cake contains a large amount of protein, oil, carbohydrates and other nutrients of high nutritional value for animals, and is the best feed for livestock. However, directly using it as fertilizer can only utilize about 10 percent of its components (mainly nitrogen) for plant absorption; the rest, which is the best nutrient for animals, is wasted. If the soybean cake used as fertilizer can be used to feed pigs, it can not only solve the problem of pig feed, develop pig farming, accelerate pig fattening, increase meat production, and improve the utilization value of soybean cake; on the other hand, the manure excreted by pigs is more important from the perspective of accumulating fertilizer and increasing production. Because in addition to accumulating the manure excreted by pigs, pig raising can also utilize farm waste and weeds in the fields as bedding, increasing a large amount of organic fertilizer. In areas with the habit of using bedding, the fertilizer accumulated by farmers using pig raising exceeds several times the manure excreted by pigs. These large amounts of organic fertilizer that improve the soil have a much greater effect on increasing production than using soybean cake alone. Therefore, advocating feeding pigs with soybean cake first is very important for maximizing the effectiveness of soybean cake. However, the calculation figures for the nitrogen content of pig manure and soybean cake in Li Pengyin's article are incorrect. Localities should not use that example in their publicity.

### 对“中国人民感谢苏联农学专家卢森科”一文中关于豆饼养猪所积猪粪含氮量计算错误的更正

    对“中国人民感谢苏联农学专家卢森科”一文中关于豆饼养猪所积猪粪含氮量计算错误的更正
    一九五二年八月新华社记者李蓬茵所写的“中国人民感谢苏联农学专家卢森科”（见一九五二年八月二十三日本报）一文，引用了本部一段错误的翻译记录。把猪粪的含氮量千分之四到五，错成百分之二到三，并由此引申一段不切实际的解释说：“一头猪一年约吃五百斤豆饼，但可产二吨粪便。豆饼的含氮量为百分之六——七，猪粪的含氮量是百分之二——三。五百斤豆饼只含肥三十五斤。如以五百斤豆饼喂猪所得的两吨（四千斤）猪粪，却含氮一百二十斤。”
    该文发表时，我们没有细心校阅，以致未能改正这一错误。这篇文章发表后，各地报刊纷纷引用，在农民群众中进行了错误的宣传。全国合作总社曾根据这个数字发布过指示；西北农林局并引用这个材料通知西北各级农林机关大力推广。我们对于这样一个涉及广大农民生产的科学问题，始则态度不慎，当记者把这个材料送交我们审阅时，又未请专家亲自校阅，继则听之任之，没有及时更正，这说明我们官僚主义作风是严重的。现在为了澄清对这一个问题的认识，说明如下：
    农家自积的厩肥、堆肥，含有较多的有机质，它具有改良土壤、培养地力的显著效能，是农业生产上最基本的肥料。各种油饼和化学肥料只能补助农家肥料的不足，决不能代替农家自积肥料。因此，提倡积肥是目前解决肥料不足的基本任务，特别是养猪积肥。
    直接用豆饼做肥料是一种很大的浪费，因为豆饼中含有大量的蛋白质、油脂、碳水化合物等多种对动物富有营养价值的养分，是家畜最好的饲料。但直接用它做肥料，只能利用其成分中约占百分之十的养分（主要是氮素），供植物吸收；其余对于动物说来是最好的养分却都被浪费了。如果能把做肥料的豆饼用来喂猪，不仅可以解决猪的饲料，发展养猪，加速猪的肥育，增加产肉量，提高豆饼的利用价值；另一方面，猪所排泄的粪便，从积肥增产的作用上来看，更具有重要意义。因为养猪除了积存猪所排泄的粪便外，更能利用农场废物及田间杂草垫圈，增加大量有机肥料。在有垫圈习惯地区，农家利用养猪所积存的肥料要超过猪所排泄的粪便几倍以上。这些具有改良土壤的大量有机质肥料，对于增产的效能也远远超过单用豆饼。因此提倡用豆饼先喂猪，对发挥豆饼的最大效用，是十分重要的。但是李蓬茵在该文中对猪粪和豆饼所含氮量的计算数字，却是错误的。各地在宣传中不应采用那个例子。
