    Guizhou and Shandong Cooperatives
    Prepare Farm Tools and Fertilizer to Support Autumn Harvest and Planting

    Cooperatives in Guizhou are actively preparing to supply farmers of all ethnic groups with farm tools for the autumn harvest.

    Guizhou Province is characterized by high mountains and steep ridges, and the soil quality varies. The specifications and quality of farm tools used by farmers of various ethnic groups are highly inconsistent. Even families living in the same village often use farm tools that are not completely identical.

    Cooperative federations in various counties began preparing to supply farmers with autumn harvest farm tools as early as April and May. Generally, meetings of primary cooperative directors were convened to make arrangements. Many cooperatives, based on the shortcomings in last year's autumn harvest farm tool supply work, began to emphasize investigation and research. Before formulating the supply plan, the Second and Fifth Districts of Fuquan County focused on surveying the opinions of farmers in three townships on the farm tool supply work. The Sancha Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zunyi County carefully studied the quantity, specifications, and styles of products based on the local people's habits and needs. To ensure that the specifications were suitable, the cooperative first made farm tool samples for the masses to provide feedback and then revised them. Among them, after the masses gave their opinions on the winnowing fan, the height of the fan legs was increased, and ginkgo trees were used as raw materials. The seven primary cooperatives in Suiyang County plan to supply as many as seventeen types of farm tools, totaling more than 2.48 million pieces.

    Most of the skilled handicraft workers in various places have signed processing contracts with cooperatives to ensure that high-quality farm tools are produced to supply farmers for the autumn harvest. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Suiyang County agreed with scattered handicraft households to deliver goods at designated locations to facilitate local supply. To supplement insufficient local processing, cooperatives in various places also purchased goods from other regions. The Majiang County Cooperative has sent people to Chong'anjiang to order 2,000 straw mats. The preparatory committee of the Guizhou Provincial Cooperative Federation has supplied 88 tons of scrap copper to Qianxi, Guizhu, and other twelve counties as raw materials for manufacturing farm tools.

    Cooperatives in counties such as Shenxian, Shanghe, and Laixi in Shandong Province are actively preparing various small farm tools and fertilizers to support farmers in the autumn harvest and planting.

    Since mid-July, the Shenxian County Cooperative Federation has purchased 250 improved plows, 80 waterwheels, and more than 1,000 pieces of various small farm tools. In terms of fertilizer preparation, in addition to purchasing a batch of bean cake and cottonseed cake and vigorously organizing the local processing of cottonseed cake, it also conducted in-depth publicity and promotion of chemical fertilizers to expand the source of fertilizer from all aspects to ensure sufficient supply. In July, the Shanghe County Cooperative Federation conducted a survey and research on the farmers' needs for fertilizer. To ensure a sufficient supply of fertilizer, the County Cooperative Federation, on the one hand, allocated 700,000 jin of soybeans from the Grain Bureau for processing; on the other hand, it collected cottonseeds and processed a large amount of cottonseed cake, estimating that about one million jin could be processed by the end of August. In early July, the Nanlan Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Laixi County organized two groups of blacksmiths to specialize in manufacturing small farm tools. Up to now, it has manufactured 600 sickles, 800 "donkey shoes," more than 50 small hoes, more than 70 large hoes, and helped farmers repair more than 100 various farm tools and process more than 500 brooms.

    贵州、山东各地合作社
    准备农具肥料支持秋收秋种
    贵州各地合作社积极准备供应各族农民秋收农具。
    贵州省山高岭峻，土质不一样，各地各族农民使用农具的规格质量极不统一，往往同居一个村子的农家所用的农具也不完全相同。
    各县合作社联合社早在四、五月间就开始供应农民秋收农具的准备工作，一般都召开了基层社主任会议，进行布置。许多合作社根据去年秋收农具供应工作中的缺点，开始重视调查研究。福泉县二区和五区在订供应计划之前，重点调查了三个乡农民对供应农具工作的意见。遵义县三岔乡供销合作社根据当地群众习惯和需要，认真研究了产品的数量、规格和式样；为了确保规格合用，该社先将农具样品作好，让群众提意见，然后加以修改。其中风车经群众提意见后，改高了车脚，并改用银杏树做原料。绥阳县七个基层社计划供应的农具已达十七种，数量共达二百四十八万多件。
    各地技术好的手工业工人差不多都和合作社订了加工合同，保证做出质量高的农具，供应农民秋收。绥阳县各级供销合作社向分散的手工业户议定在一定地点交货，以便就地供应。为了补助本地加工不足，各地合作社还向外地购货，麻江县合作社已派人到重安江去订购晒席二千床。贵州省合作社联合社筹备委员会现已供应黔西、贵筑等十二县废铜八十八吨，以作制造农具的原料。（新华社）
    山东省莘县、商河、莱西等县合作社积极准备各种小农具和肥料，支持农民秋收秋种。
    莘县合作社联合社自七月中旬开始，先后购进步犁二百五十部、水车八十架、各种小农具一千余件。在准备肥料方面，除购进一批豆饼、棉籽饼和就地大力组织加工棉籽饼外，还深入宣传推广化学肥料，从各方面扩大肥料来源，以保证充分供应。商河县合作社联合社在七月份曾对农民需要肥料的情况进行了调查研究。为了保证充分供应肥料，县合作社联合社一方面从粮食局拨进七十万斤大豆组织加工；一方面搜集棉籽，大量加工棉籽饼，估计八月底可加工出一百万斤左右。莱西县南岚村供销合作社在七月初组织了两帮铁匠专门制造小农具，到目前已制造出镰刀六百把，“驴掌”八百付，小镢五十余张，大镢等七十余件，并帮助农民修理各种农具一百余件，加工扫帚五百余把。
