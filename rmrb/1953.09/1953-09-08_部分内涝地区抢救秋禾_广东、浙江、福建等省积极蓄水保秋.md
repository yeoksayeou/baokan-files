    Farmers in waterlogged areas of the Northeast and Hebei, Shandong provinces are actively draining water to rescue autumn crops.

    (By this newspaper) From August 8th to 20th, the Northeast region generally experienced heavy rainfall. The rainfall was greatest in the middle reaches of the Liao River and the upper reaches of the Second Songhua River, causing the water levels of the Songhua River, Liao River, Hun River, and other rivers to rise. In some areas, the river water overflowed its banks, and low-lying areas were flooded, inundating autumn crops in the riverside areas. Party and government leading organs in the waterlogged areas immediately determined that draining water to protect the autumn harvest was the overriding central task, and organized farmers to rescue autumn grain crops. The Liaoxi Provincial People's Government quickly transported late-season seeds to the flooded areas. The Tie嶺 County People's Government in the province also transferred 150 cadres to the waterlogged areas to help farmers drain water and save seedlings. After the internal water was drained, farmers immediately propped up the fallen crops, straightened the leaves, trimmed the leaf tips, and washed away the mud from the ears of corn, sorghum, and rice to facilitate grain growth. In many areas, farmers quickly replanted late-season crops after the internal water was drained to compensate for the loss of autumn grain.

    Drainage work in the waterlogged areas of Hebei Province is proceeding intensely. As of September 1st, more than 50 percent of the accumulated water had been drained. Cadres at all levels in the Ding County area actively mobilized the masses to find ways to drain water. The area now drained has reached 75 percent of the flooded area. In order to strengthen drainage work, the Shijiazhuang area specially formed a drainage command in Hengshui to uniformly guide the orderly drainage of the counties, contacting the Commissioner's Office and the counties daily to grasp the situation and solve problems. Except for some areas where the terrain is too low to be easily drained, most of the waterlogged areas in the entire area can be drained. In order to strengthen the technical guidance of drainage work, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Department of Water Resources of the Hebei Provincial People's Government recently transferred more than 100 experienced cadres and technicians to form five working groups, carrying measuring instruments, to Cang County, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Xingtai, Handan and other areas to assist in drainage work.

    Since the beginning of the flood season in Shandong Province, the total rainfall in general areas has reached more than 500 mm by mid-August, and in individual areas it has reached more than 900 mm, exceeding the previous average annual rainfall in Shandong Province. Many areas suffered from waterlogging. Under the leadership of responsible party and government cadres, a large number of cadres went deep into the countryside to lead the broad masses of farmers in the struggle to drain water and save seedlings. The Dezhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Dezhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office transferred more than 80 cadres to various counties to lead farmers in draining water and providing disaster relief. Deping, Linyi, Qihe and other counties also transferred a large number of cadres to drain water and provide disaster relief. This work has now made great progress. The accumulated water in 64 depressions in Chiping County has basically been drained, and most of the land flooded in the Huichuan River Basin in the Tai'an area has been saved.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 7th. Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shaanxi and other provinces have experienced rainfall successively from mid-August to early September. Guangdong Province has had several rains since mid-August. Now, the newly transplanted late rice seedlings have turned green, and some have begun to tiller; the early transplanted seedlings are already one and a half feet tall. Farmers everywhere are carrying out the second weeding and topdressing, and some places have already carried out the third cultivation. In many areas where there is no habit of fertilizing late rice, farmers are also stepping up their efforts to accumulate and apply fertilizer. From August 27 to September 4, the average total rainfall in Zhejiang Province reached 79.2 mm, nearly double the rainfall for the entire month of July. After the rain, various crops grew rapidly, and most late autumn crops are expected to increase production. Crops that had withered due to drought have largely turned green. It is estimated that each mu of ramie in Xiaoshan County can yield 20 to 50 jin more than before the rain. The dry white fields in Changxing County have been moistened after the rain, and rice has begun to grow normally. The corn in the Songxia area of Shangyu County grew one inch overnight after the rain. Many mountainous areas that have been severely affected by drought also have water, and miscellaneous grain crops have generally turned green. From the end of August to the beginning of September, most areas of Fujian Province experienced rainfall. The drought-stricken Longxi, Jinjiang, and Fu'an areas along the coast experienced the most rainfall, generally ranging from 70 mm to 100 mm, with a maximum of 180 mm. Now, the drought in the coastal areas has been basically relieved. From the end of August to the beginning of September, Shaanxi Province experienced rainfall in various places. On August 29, the rainfall in Yan'an and Mizhi counties reached about 100 mm; Nanzheng County received 170 mm of rainfall. From September 3 to 4, more than 20 counties in the Guanzhong area, including Gaoling, Jingyang, and Xingping, received 24 mm to 31 mm of rainfall. This rain not only has good benefits for the growth of late autumn crops, but also enables the timely sowing of winter wheat.

    In order to strive for increased production of late autumn crops, farmers in Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian and other provinces are now making efforts to store water and protect the autumn harvest after the rain. Farmers in Nanxiong County, Guangdong Province, are actively blocking and storing water. The mountain ponds and water channels are full of water, which can generally provide water for 20 days. Farmers in six townships in Suixi County have sealed 36 sluices, ponds, and ditches in two days, storing 2.3 million cubic meters of water, which can provide water for more than 80,000 mu of farmland for one month. The drought in some areas of Zhoushan and Jiaxing areas in Zhejiang Province has not been completely relieved, and the local party and government leading organs are still continuing to lead farmers in fighting drought and protecting the autumn harvest. In areas where there is enough rainwater, farmers are turning to autumn harvest and autumn cultivation.

    部分内涝地区抢救秋禾
    广东、浙江、福建等省积极蓄水保秋
    【本报讯】东北区及河北、山东等省部分内涝地区的农民，正积极排水抢救秋禾。
    八月八日到二十日，东北境内普遍连降大雨，辽河中游和第二松花江上游降雨量最大，以致松花江、辽河、浑河等河流水位上涨，部分地区的河水漫堤，低洼地带积水成涝，沿河地区的秋庄稼被水淹没。各内涝地区的党政领导机关立即确定以排水保秋为当前压倒一切的中心工作，组织农民抢救秋粮作物。辽西省人民政府迅速将晚田籽种运到各被淹地区。该省铁岭县人民政府并抽调一百五十名干部，分赴内涝地区帮助农民排水救苗。各地农民把内水排出后，立即把被冲倒的庄稼扶起来，顺叶、掏叶尖，并洗净玉米和高粱、水稻穗的泥浆，使籽粒容易成长。不少地区农民在内水排出后，很快抢种上了晚庄稼。以补救秋粮的损失。
    河北省各积水地区的排水工作，正紧张进行中。到九月一日止，共已排出积水百分之五十以上。定县专区各级干部积极发动群众寻找排水门路，现脱水面积已达被淹面积的百分之七十五。石家庄专区为加强排水工作，特在衡水组成排水指挥部，统一指导各县有秩序地进行排水，每天和专署及各县联系，掌握情况，解决问题。全专区积水地除部分地区因地势过低，不易排除外，大部可以排出。河北省人民政府农林厅和水利厅为了加强排水工作的技术指导，最近又抽调了一百余名有经验的干部和技术人员，组成五个工作组，携带测量仪器，分赴沧县、石家庄、天津、邢台、邯郸等专区，协助进行排水工作。
    山东省自进入汛期以来，到八月中旬，一般地区降雨总量已达五百公厘以上，个别地区达到九百多公厘，超过山东省以往的平均全年雨量。许多地区内涝成灾。在党、政负责干部的带领下，大批干部深入农村，领导广大农民进行排水救苗的斗争。中共德州地委、德州专署抽调干部八十多人，分赴各县领导农民进行排水救灾工作。德平、临邑、齐河等县也抽调大批干部排水救灾。这一工作现已做出了很大成绩。茌平县六十四处洼地积水已基本上排出，泰安专区汇河流域被淹土地的极大部分都已救出。
    【新华社七日讯】八月中旬到九月初，广东、浙江、福建和陕西等省都先后下雨。广东省从八月中旬以来已下过几场雨。现在，新插的晚稻禾苗都已转青，有些已开始分蘖；早插的禾苗已有一尺半高。各地农民正在进行第二次除草、追肥，有的地方已作第三次中耕。许多没有晚稻施肥习惯的地区，农民们也加紧积肥、施肥。浙江省自八月二十七日起到九月四日止，平均总雨量达七十九点二公厘，近七月份全月雨量的一倍。各种农作物得雨后，都生长迅速，大部晚秋作物可望增产。原来受旱枯萎了的作物，已大部转青。萧山县的络麻估计每亩可比雨前多收二十斤到五十斤。长兴县雨后干白田已经湿润，水稻开始正常生长。上虞县崧厦区的玉米，雨后一夜就长了一寸。许多受旱严重的山区也已有水，杂粮作物普遍转青。八月底九月初，福建省大部地区下雨。沿海受旱的龙溪、晋江、福安等专区雨量最大，一般都在七十公厘到一百公厘左右，最多达一百八十公厘。现在，沿海地区旱象已基本解除。陕西省八月底九月初，各地先后得雨。八月二十九日，延安、米脂两县雨量达一百公厘左右；南郑县降雨一百七十公厘。九月三日到四日，关中地区高陵、泾阳、兴平等二十多县降雨二十四公厘到三十一公厘。这场雨不但对晚秋作物生长有良好收益，并可使冬小麦播种得以及时进行。
    为了争取晚秋作物增产，现在广东、浙江、福建等省农民都在雨后作蓄水、保秋的努力。广东省南雄县农民积极堵水、蓄水，各处的山塘和水圳都已水满，一般能有二十天的用水。遂溪县六个乡的农民，两天内塞好三十六处水闸、水塘和沟圳，蓄水二百三十万立方公尺，可供八万多亩农田一个月的用水。浙江省舟山、嘉兴两专区部分地区的旱象还未完全解除，当地党、政领导机关仍在继续领导农民抗旱保秋。雨水已够的地区，农民们正转向秋收、秋耕。
