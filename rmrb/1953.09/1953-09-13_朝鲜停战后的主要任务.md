The great victory of the heroic Korean and Chinese people against the American aggression war has written an infinitely glorious page in the history of the world's people's struggle to defend peace.

Comrade Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in his "Report on the Work of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea" delivered at the 24th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, is a summary of this infinitely glorious page of history.

After listening to Commander Peng Dehuai's report, the Central People's Government Committee passed a message of sympathy to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, thanking them for their outstanding contributions in this just war. This warm gratitude is shared by all the people of China and all peace-loving people around the world.

Now that the Korean armistice has been realized, the new tasks before us are: to consolidate the Korean armistice, strictly prevent the recurrence of the war of aggression, promote the smooth convening of the political conference, and further seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

A peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is the consistent position of the Chinese people. When the U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, the democratic parties of China in their joint declaration on November 4, 1950, already pointed out: "We advocate that the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully, and the imperialist aggressor troops should withdraw from Korea." The realization of the Korean armistice proves that in the current international situation, the only possible and correct way to resolve all international disputes is through peaceful consultation among the countries concerned.

The realization of the Korean armistice is only the first step in striving for a peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue. To achieve a genuine peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it requires the continuous efforts of the people of both countries and all peace-loving people around the world to ensure the full implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and promote the smooth convening of the high-level political conference stipulated in Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement.

After the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Korean and Chinese People's forces have strictly observed and fulfilled all the provisions of the Armistice Agreement. Regarding the convening of the political conference, we have put forward a sound and reasonable plan, that is: the political conference should be in the nature of a round-table conference, conducted in an atmosphere of equal consultation. The countries participating in the conference should not only include the two sides of the war, but also neutral countries that are concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, such as the Soviet Union and other Asian countries like India. This reasonable proposal can ensure the possibility of success of the political conference and lead to a peaceful solution of the Korean issue and other issues in the Far East.

However, current indications show that the U.S. imperialist aggression group is still trying its best to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice and is planning to obstruct and sabotage the convening of the political conference.

The U.S. aggression group not only openly condoned the Lee Seung-man group's sabotage of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war in the Armistice Agreement on the eve of the signing of the Armistice Agreement, forcibly detaining more than 27,000 captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side, and has not yet accounted for or recovered them; but also openly supports and assists the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in sending a large number of special agents to prisoner-of-war camps in Jeju Island and other places, openly coercing and detaining captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Although the work of directly repatriating prisoners of war has ended, the U.S. military authorities are still forcibly detaining many captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side who should be directly repatriated. The work of the representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross Societies in providing humanitarian services to prisoners of war has been subjected to various unreasonable obstructions, restrictions, and personal attacks by the U.S. military authorities, and they have been unable to carry out their work to this day. In the demilitarized zone, U.S. military personnel continue to illegally cross the border and intrude into our area, and send special agents to enter our defense line to carry out activities. U.S. aircraft frequently intrude into the airspace above the demilitarized zone to circle and harass. All these facts show that the U.S. aggression group has not seriously observed and fulfilled the Armistice Agreement; and the U.S. side often avoids making clear answers and explanations to the various protests and inquiries raised by the Korean and Chinese side. The U.S. aggression group's breach of faith and sabotage of the Armistice Agreement has aroused great anger from the Korean and Chinese people.

The U.S. aggression group is planning to set up layers of obstacles for the upcoming political conference. The so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the U.S. warmonger Dulles and Lee Seung-man stipulates that the U.S. military has the right to stay in South Korea indefinitely, and jointly declared with Lee Seung-man that if the political conference cannot "unify" Korea according to Lee Seung-man's intentions, the United States will withdraw from the political conference together with Lee Seung-man after three months. Dulles also forced the fifteen countries that sent troops to Korea to jointly issue the so-called "Sixteen-Nation Declaration," claiming that if the war of aggression against Korea restarts, the scope of the war will be expanded to areas outside of Korea. At the United Nations General Assembly, the United States, disregarding the common opinions of many countries, excluded India and other relevant countries from participating in the political conference, attempting to turn the political conference into another Panmunjom negotiation. The United States' planned obstruction and sabotage of the convening of the political conference is clearly aimed at keeping Korea in a state of division and confrontation, continuing to maintain tension in Korea, in order to facilitate its continued pursuit of the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war in the Far East.

It is clear that the U.S. aggressors have not learned the lessons they deserved from their failure in Korea. They are unwilling to accept their failure in Korea and may create provocations and conspiracies at any time. In this regard, the Korean and Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world must raise serious vigilance and continue to persevere in their struggle. The Central People's Government Committee said in its message of sympathy to the Volunteer Army: "The withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue under the spirit of the Korean people handling their own affairs, still awaits negotiation and resolution at a higher-level political conference. The Chinese people have always advocated resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation, and the Chinese people are willing to provide a strong backing for the peaceful settlement of international issues." At present, we must first strive to hold the political conference well so that the Korean issue can be truly resolved peacefully.

Another urgent task facing the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world after the realization of the Korean armistice is to heal the war wounds suffered by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and assist the Korean people in rebuilding a peaceful life. Previously, at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Marshal Kim Il-sung called on the Korean people to immediately begin to restore and develop the post-war national economy, which has been enthusiastically responded to by the Korean people, which shows the strong will of the Korean people to restore and rebuild their motherland. This enthusiasm of the Korean people for rebuilding their motherland has been sympathized with and supported by the governments and people of all countries in the entire peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union. The Soviet government first allocated 1 billion rubles for the restoration and development of the Korean people's economy, and formulated specific measures to first help the Korean people restore the construction of Korea's largest factories and enterprises, help restore Korea's shipping and oil refining industries, and rebuild education and health undertakings that have been damaged by the war. European people's democratic countries and the Mongolian People's Republic have also provided important assistance to the peaceful construction of the Korean people. Our people are even more concerned about the efforts of the Korean people to rebuild a peaceful life and strengthen their national defense. The Central People's Government Committee stated in its message of sympathy to the Volunteer Army: "All the Chinese people will support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army by vigorously carrying out economic construction, strengthening national defense, and continuing to deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The government and people of the People's Republic of China will do their best to help the heroic Korean people heal the wounds of war and restore a peaceful life." We believe that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and government, and with the active assistance of all countries in the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, the work of restoring and rebuilding the Korean people's economy will definitely progress rapidly.

The tasks undertaken by the Korean and Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world are still enormous after the realization of the Korean armistice. Any slackness or paralysis will harm our cause of maintaining peace. To accomplish these tasks, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the people of the whole country must continue to fight unyieldingly.

### 朝鲜停战后的主要任务

    朝鲜停战后的主要任务
    英勇的朝鲜人民和中国人民反抗美国侵略战争的伟大胜利，在世界人民保卫和平的斗争史上，写下了无限光辉的一页。
    中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀同志在中央人民政府委员会第二十四次会议上所做的“关于中国人民志愿军抗美援朝工作的报告”，就是这一页无限光辉的历史的总结。
    中央人民政府委员会听取了彭德怀司令员的报告之后，通过了给中国人民志愿军慰问电，感谢他们在这一正义战争中的卓越贡献。这种感谢的热忱，是全中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民所共有的。
    现在朝鲜停战已经实现了，摆在我们面前的新的任务就是：巩固朝鲜停战，严防侵略战争的再起，促成政治会议的顺利召开，进一步谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    和平解决朝鲜问题是我国人民的一贯主张。当美帝国主义发动侵朝战争之初，我国各民主党派在一九五○年十一月四日发表的联合宣言已经指出：“我们主张朝鲜问题应当以和平方式来解决，帝国主义者的侵略军应当从朝鲜撤回去。”朝鲜停战的实现证明，在目前国际形势下，一切国际争端的解决，只有有关国家彼此进行和平协商，才是唯一可能和正确的途径。
    朝鲜停战的实现，只是争取和平解决整个朝鲜问题的第一步。要使朝鲜问题得到真正的和平解决，还需要两国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民进行不断的努力，保证朝鲜停战协定的完全实现，促成按照停战协定第六十款所规定的高一级政治会议的顺利召开。
    朝中人民部队在朝鲜停战协定签字之后，已经严格地遵守并履行了停战协定的一切规定。对于政治会议的召开，我们已经提出了健全合理的方案，即：政治会议应该是圆桌会议的性质，在平等协商的气氛下进行，参加会议的国家不仅要有战争的双方，而且要有那些关心朝鲜问题和平解决的中立国家苏联和亚洲其他国家如印度等国参加。这个合理的主张，可以保证政治会议有成功的可能，可以导致朝鲜问题及远东其他问题的和平解决。
    可是，目前的种种迹象显示，美帝国主义侵略集团仍图竭力保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，并正有计划地阻挠和破坏政治会议的召开。
    美国侵略集团不仅在停战协定签字前夕公开纵容李承晚集团破坏停战协定中关于战俘遣返的协议，强迫扣留朝中方面的被俘人员二万七千多名，至今不予交代追回；并且在停战协定签字之后，还在公开支持与协助蒋介石匪帮派遣大批特务到济州岛等地战俘营，公然进行胁迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员的活动。直接遣返战俘的工作虽已结束，但美国军事当局仍然强迫扣留着朝中方面许多应予直接遣返的被俘人员。朝中红十字会代表对战俘提供人道服务的工作，遭到美方军事当局的种种无理的阻挠、限制以及人身的攻击，至今无法进行工作。在非军事区，美方军事人员还不断非法越界侵入我方地区，并派遣特务进入我方防线进行活动，美方飞机更经常侵入非军事区上空盘旋骚扰。所有这些事实，都说明美国侵略集团并没有认真遵守并履行停战协定；而对于朝中方面所提出的各种抗议和质询，美方经常避免作明确的答复和交代。美国侵略集团这种不顾信义的破坏停战协定的行为，已引起朝中人民极大的愤怒。
    美国侵略集团对于即将召开的政治会议，正在有计划地布置层层障碍。美国的好战分子杜勒斯与李承晚签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，规定美军有权无限期留驻南朝鲜，并和李承晚共同声明，如果政治会议不能按照李承晚意图由他来“统一”朝鲜的话，美国就将和李承晚一道在三个月之后退出政治会议。杜勒斯并强迫出兵朝鲜的十五个国家和美国共同发表所谓“十六国宣言”，声言如果侵朝战争再起，战争范围就要扩大到朝鲜以外的区域。在联合国大会上，美国竟不顾许多国家的共同意见，排斥印度和其他有关国家参加政治会议，企图使政治会议变成另一个板门店谈判。美国有计划地阻挠和破坏政治会议的召开，其目的显然是要使朝鲜继续处于南北分裂和对立的状态，在朝鲜继续保持紧张局势，以便利它在远东继续推行扩军备战政策。
    由此可见，美国侵略者并没有从它在朝鲜的失败中吸取应得的教训，它对于在朝鲜的失败是不甘心的，还有随时制造挑衅阴谋的可能。对此，朝中人民和全世界和平人民不能不提起严重的警惕，继续坚持斗争。中央人民政府委员会在给志愿军的慰问电中说：“一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，朝鲜问题在朝鲜人自己处理自己问题的精神下的和平解决，尚有待于高一级的政治会议去协商解决。中国人民是一贯主张以和平协商方式解决国际争端的，中国人民愿为和平解决国际问题作坚强的后盾。”目前，我们首先就要争取开好政治会议，使朝鲜问题得到真正的和平解决。
    朝鲜停战实现后，摆在朝中人民以及世界人民面前的另一个迫切的任务，是医治朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所遭受的战争创伤，协助朝鲜人民重建和平生活。前此在朝鲜劳动党中央委员会第六次全体会议上，金日成元帅号召朝鲜人民立即着手恢复和发展战后人民经济，已经得到朝鲜人民的热烈响应，这表现了朝鲜人民恢复和重建祖国的坚强意志。朝鲜人民这种重建祖国的热情，得到了以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营各国政府和人民的同情和支持。苏联政府首先拨款十亿卢布，作为恢复与发展朝鲜人民经济的用途，并拟定了具体办法，首先帮助朝鲜人民恢复建设朝鲜最大的工厂、企业，帮助恢复朝鲜的海运和炼油业并重建遭受战争破坏的教育和保健事业。欧洲人民民主国家和蒙古人民共和国对于朝鲜人民的和平建设，也作了重要的援助。我国人民对于朝鲜人民重建和平生活、加强国防力量的努力，更是十分关切。中央人民政府委员会在给志愿军的慰问电中声明：“全中国人民将以大力进行经济建设，加强国防力量，继续深入地开展抗美援朝运动，来支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。中华人民共和国政府和人民将尽力来帮助英雄的朝鲜人民医治战争创伤，恢复和平生活。”我们相信，在朝鲜劳动党和政府的领导下，在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国的积极帮助下，朝鲜人民经济的恢复和重建工作，一定能够迅速地进展。
    朝中人民以及全世界爱好和平人民所担负的任务，在朝鲜停战实现之后仍然是巨大的，任何松懈麻痹，都会使我们维护和平的事业遭受损害。为了完成这些任务，我国人民志愿军和全国人民必须继续不屈不挠地奋斗。
