    Boshan Electric Motor Factory Seriously Neglects Quality
    Many Products Have to be Reworked After Leaving the Factory
    A letter from Wang Shiying, a finished product inspector in the Inspection Section of the Boshan Electric Motor Factory: The low quality of our factory's products is very serious. Most of the products from the first quarter are still being reworked. It was discovered after the Type GAZi-51 motor regulators left the factory that they could not be used, so people had to be sent to the ordering unit to repair them. It was discovered before the 3kW and 6kW distribution panels left the factory that the electric meters could not be used, but in order not to delay the delivery date, they were still passed off as qualified products and shipped out, and people were sent to the ordering department afterward to replace the meters. Almost none of the electric meters in the distribution panels produced by our factory before July are accurate to the required standard.
    However, instead of fundamentally trying to solve the problem with unqualified products, our factory leaders rely on methods such as relaxing inspection standards to allow them to "leave the factory." For example, the old specification for 10kVA transformers stipulated that iron loss should not exceed 90 watts, but it was later relaxed to not exceed 95 watts, and now it has been relaxed to not exceed 125 watts. The previous specification for the no-load current of 20kVA single-phase transformers was not to exceed 4.2 amps, but it has now been relaxed to 5.5 amps. When the insulation oil of DC generators splashes during use, the insulation and withstand voltage levels do not meet the standards after a few days; the leaders of our factory let the generators be inspected for insulation and withstand voltage performance as soon as they are removed from the drying room, and then they don't care whether they are good or bad after they leave the factory. In short, when inspectors point out that a certain product is unqualified, the leaders do not check where the problem lies and then try to improve the work; instead, they only care about whether they can accommodate it.
    In addition, some products are manufactured in large quantities before trial production has been successful. Some products do not have definite inspection specifications and standards. Some products have drawings full of errors and are changed at any time, causing confusion in the production process. These situations also affect the quality of our factory's products, but the leaders have not paid attention to or resolved them.
    The ordering units are very dissatisfied with the low quality of our factory's products. Recently, several units sent people to inspect the finished products and refused to accept products of inferior quality. It is hoped that the Shandong Electrical Industry Bureau will take necessary measures as soon as possible to urge our factory to quickly improve this situation.

### 博山电机厂严重忽视质量  许多产品出厂后又得返工

    博山电机厂严重忽视质量
    许多产品出厂后又得返工
    博山电机厂检验课成品检验员王世英来信：我厂产品质量低劣的情况很严重。第一季度的产品，到现在大部分仍在返工中。嘎斯五十一型电机调节器在出厂后才发觉不能使用，只好派人前往订货单位修理。三瓩和六瓩的配电盘在出厂前已发现电表不能使用，但为了不误交货日期，仍然混充合格品出厂，事后再派人前往订货部门换表。本厂七月份以前出厂的配电盘，几乎没有一个电表的准确程度是合规格的。
    但是，我厂领导干部对待不合格产品不是从根本上去设法解决，而是依靠放宽检查规格标准等办法来让它们“出厂”。如十千伏安变压器过去的规格规定铁损不得超过九十瓦特，后来放松到不得超过九十五瓦特，现在一直放松到不得超过一百二十五瓦特。二十千伏安的单相变压器以前规定空载电流的规格为不得超过四点二安培，现在放松到五点五安培。直流发电机使用时绝缘油四溅，几天以后绝缘和耐压程度就不符合标准了；我厂领导干部就让发电机在刚抬出干燥室时就检查绝缘和耐压性能，出厂后好坏就不管了。总之，当检查员提出某一种产品不合格时，领导干部不是检查问题在那里，然后设法改进工作；而却只关心能不能迁就过去。
    此外，有些产品在试制尚未成功时即开始大批制造。有些产品还没有确定的检查规格标准。有些产品的图纸错误百出，随时更改，使生产过程中产生混乱情况。这些情况也都影响了我厂产品质量，但领导干部一直没有加以重视和解决。
    订货单位对我厂产品质量低劣的情况是很不满意的。最近好几个单位派人来验收成品时，就拒绝接受质量次的产品。希望山东电器工业管理局迅速采取必要措施，督促我厂迅速改善这种状况。
