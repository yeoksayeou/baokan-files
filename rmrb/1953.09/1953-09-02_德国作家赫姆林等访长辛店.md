    German Democratic Republic writers Stephan Hermlin and Jan Petersen, who are visiting China, were accompanied by Chinese writers Feng Zhi and Ma Feng on a visit to the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory on the 1st.

    Hermlin and Petersen listened with great interest to He Fengting, the captain of the workers' pickets during the "February 7th" Great Strike, recounting the factory's revolutionary history. Changxindian is one of the birthplaces of the Chinese workers' movement. The friends listened to the story of the factory's workers holding a demonstration on May 1, 1921, and the circumstances of their participation in the world-famous "February 7th" Great Strike in 1923 and the heroic struggle of the workers at that time, and said that they would definitely tell German workers and working people what they had heard.

    The East German writers also visited the workers' sanatorium, which has sixty beds, and the workers who have undergone treatment have gained an average of 2.5 kilograms in weight. They also visited the nursery and the factory library, which has more than 18,000 books and more than 6,000 readers every month. All of these gave the writers a very good impression.

    Since arriving in Beijing on August 26, Hermlin and Petersen have visited scenic spots such as the Temple of Heaven, the Forbidden City, Beihai Park, and the Great Wall, and visited writers Ding Ling, Lao She, and the famous painter Qi Baishi.

    德国作家赫姆林等访长辛店
    【新华社讯】前来我国参观访问的德意志民主共和国作家斯·赫姆林和杨·贝特尔逊，一日由我作家冯至、马烽陪同访问了长辛店机车车辆修理工厂。
    赫姆林、贝特尔逊以极大兴趣听取了“二七”大罢工时的工人纠察队队长何凤亭关于工厂革命历史的叙述。长辛店是我国职工运动发祥地之一。友人们听了关于这个工厂的工人在一九二一年五月一日举行的示威游行，和一九二三年参加世界有名的“二七”大罢工的经过和当时工人英勇斗争的情形，表示一定把所听到的告诉德国工人和劳动人民。
    民主德国作家又参观了职工业余疗养所，这里设有六十张床位，经过疗养的职工体重平均增加了二点五公斤。他们又参观了托儿所，藏书一万八千多册、每月拥有六千多个读者的工厂图书馆。这些都给了作家们以很好的印象。
    赫姆林、贝特尔逊自八月二十六日抵京后，连日来游览了天坛、故宫、北海和长城等名胜地区，访问了作家丁玲、老舍和名画家齐白石。
