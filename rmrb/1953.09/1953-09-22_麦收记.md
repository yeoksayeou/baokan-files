    Record of the Wheat Harvest
    By our reporter Fang Qing
    "The current situation is this – the wheat is ripe, and if we don't harvest it soon, the grains may fall; the combines are also repaired, and they are only used for these few days of the year; the people? Needless to say, everyone's palms are itching with eagerness; it's just that the weather is causing trouble, with a lot of rain. What to do? We must mobilize, use our brains, and think of every possible way to seize the grain in the rain!" This is the voice of Zhang Shukai, the captain of the Fourth Production Team of the Jiusan State-Owned Mechanical Farm. The day before yesterday, he went to the farm headquarters to hold a mobilization meeting to march into the wheat sea, and today he returned to the team to mobilize the team members for the wheat harvest.
    "Unforgettable 1951!" said combine operator Tong Qingshan. One sentence brought everyone to an unpleasant memory. In 1951, the wheat grew very well, but when it came to harvesting, it rained every day, and the combines couldn't go down to the fields at all. There was no preparation for manual harvesting in advance, so half of the wheat was left in the fields to germinate, resulting in a bumper yield but no bumper harvest.
    Thinking of this, the raindrops falling on the tent seemed to be tapping on everyone's heart.
    However, history's lessons will not be allowed to repeat themselves. A week ago, more than thirty wheat-cutting workers came to the Fourth Production Team, and the number of scythes was more than doubled. In case of necessity, the team, except for leaving the cooks to prepare meals, would all work together to cut wheat. Despite this, the young combine operators were unwilling to use scythes, saying that they should try to find more ways to harvest with machines. Tong Qingshan suggested at the time – in the future, the machine groups should hold group meetings to specifically study "how to harvest wheat after rain without getting the machines stuck." People sat in the driver's room of the cars, under the wooden umbrellas of the combines, studying the new situation after the rain.
    In the evening, a northwest wind scattered the clouds in the sky, and people went to the back hill to see the sunset glow. Suddenly, tractor driver Zhou Wenlian said, "The combines of the Second Team are starting to work!" As he spoke, he pointed to the West Mountain. People looked, and through the red light, it looked like two combines were蠕动 (wriggling/inching along). This was because the Second Team had a portion of sandy soil, where rainwater could easily penetrate, and they could harvest as soon as the rain stopped. This made Tong Qingshan very anxious, and he said, "If we still can't go to the fields tomorrow, we'll drive the combines to support the Second Team." It was dark, and the West Mountain spewed out white lights again. The combines were harvesting overnight, making the people of the Fourth Team feel agitated.

    The next day, a round red sun painted the grassland with a golden glow. All kinds of colorful什样锦 (assorted brocade) flowers opened their round faces and smiled at people.
    After half a day of sunshine in the morning, as soon as everyone finished lunch, they all ran to their cars. Li Shuxian didn't even change her work clothes, and got into the car wearing a花夹袄 (padded jacket with floral pattern). This was a Stalin-Nez 4 combine, and the driver was Fang Guocai, a twenty-one-year-old member of the Youth League, with an assistant. As soon as the car started, no one could suppress the smiles on their faces.
    When the engine of this combine starts, it can drive the car forward and operate the working parts. The front is the harvesting platform, like a hair clipper, the blades cut the wheat stalks back and forth. After being twisted by the滚龙 (rotating cylinder), it is like the tongue in a big mouth, sending the wheat stalks into the stomach. Its stomach is the threshing part, and after the toothed cylinder bites and grinds, the wheat grains are rubbed off, then sifted clean with a sieve, and the wheat husks are blown away by the wind. At this time, the wheat stalks leak out from the rear, and the wheat grains run to the bucket in the front. The daily quota for harvesting wheat is nine hectares.
    Three combines raced back and forth in the wheat field, like ships sailing in the sea. The day they had been looking forward to for a long time had finally arrived. Tong Qingshan was obviously clenching his teeth to operate the elevator, but he couldn't hide the smile in his eyes. Tractor assistant Wang Zhicheng kept whistling shrilly to express his inner joy. Even busier than others was the car driver Liu Yuan, who had to drive the truck to each combine in turn to unload the grain, and then send it to the drying ground. The car ran hard and couldn't keep up, so female tractor driver Peng Yalun drove her Red Horse-style tractor, with a斗车 (hopper car) behind it, to help unload the grain. This is a small rubber-wheeled tractor, all red except for the four black wheels. The frame is quite high, and when the engine starts, it bumps "突突" (thump thump) and walks fast, really like a naughty wild horse. She sits on its back, holding the steering wheel, her eyes always looking into the distance, her hair flying back past her ears, with quite a bit of the demeanor of a female knight.
    Next to the tent is the smooth drying ground. The wheat is piled up all over the ground, and it needs good sunshine to dry. Originally, only four people worked in the drying ground, but now, look, the statistician and the feeder have both picked up wooden shovels to winnow the wheat, and even the cook who has finished cooking has run over to help with an apron on. Strands of wheat grains are raised in the drying ground, scattered into a fan shape in the air, and fall back to their original place, the awns float away with the wind, falling on the headscarves of the people downwind.

    At night, the unfortunate weather brought another rain. They didn't go to the fields the next morning. The heads of each machine group went to check the land, picking those less muddy places, as long as they could barely hold the combines; they would rather use the slowest speed to try to drive. When they came back at noon to report the situation, they all shook their heads and said it was inevitable that they would get stuck. But everyone was determined, not afraid of getting stuck.
    "If we don't get stuck, we harvest, if we get stuck, we drag it out!" said the old captain Zhang Shukai. Because he is the oldest, the whole team calls him the old captain; in fact, he is not yet thirty years old this year.
    "The important thing is time!" said the work area director who came to inspect the work: "Now we are seizing grain in the rain, we must seize the time, try to use machines as much as possible, harvest as much as we can, cut as much as we can."
    After just one back-and-forth pass, Tong Qingshan's combine was stuck in the mud. Everyone tied iron chains and墊 (shimmed) with planks, and it took nearly an hour to drag it out. The second driver and two assistants went to maintain the car according to their pre-arranged division of labor, and Tong Qingshan did not stop for a moment, but took a pole to inspect the ground again.
    Tong Qingshan came back, and everywhere was very soft, wet soil, unable to carry the weight of the combine. What to do? Faced with this situation, after a moment of silence, Tong Qingshan said:
    "I think the edge of the field is drier, the wind can blow in."
    "Let's harvest along the edge, breaking the old rules, don't开道 (cut a path) in the middle."
    "Right, '蚕食' (nibble away at) it!"
    The combine started again. The work area director and the old captain personally inspected the road in front, acting as guides. Sure enough, there were no more stuck cars.
    In the evening, the wind picked up, and团 (clumps) of dark clouds rolled towards the southeast. The stronger the wind, the faster the dark clouds rolled.
    "The rain is coming!" Someone shouted.
    "Never mind it, if the car can go, we'll do it!" Tong Qingshan said, gritting his teeth. At this time, no one cared to look at the weather, they only cared about one thing – the wind would blow the wheat down, and harvesting would be even more troublesome. Therefore, they all tried to seize the time, not letting a minute pass.
    "Turn on the lights!" As soon as Fang Guocai's lights came on, all the car lights came on. The wooden turning wheels on the harvesting platform continued to rotate, and when illuminated by the bright lights, they looked like undulating waves, or a pile of吞吞吐吐 (flickering) flames.
    The wind grew stronger. The thunder grew louder. The harvest continued.
    The rain was really coming. The district director said, "If it rains again, install滑板 (skid boards) under the wheels of the combine to widen the area where the wheels touch the ground, so it will be less likely to sink; if it rains again, we still have manpower, we have scythes, the wheat must be harvested."
    Let the storm come even more fiercely! Young and brave warriors, in any environment, they will bring the grain home.

    麦收记
    本报记者　方青
    “现在的情况是——麦子熟透了，再不割就可能掉粒；康拜因也修好了，一年就用它这么几天；人呢？更不用说，个个急的手心直发痒；就是天气找麻烦，雨很多。怎么办呢？我们要动员起来，开动脑筋，想尽一切办法，雨里抢粮！”这是九三国营机械农场第四生产队张树魁队长的声音。前天，他到场部开了个向麦海进军的誓师大会，今天回到队上来，向队员们动员麦收。
    “难忘的一九五一年！”康拜因手佟庆山说。一句话把大家引到一个不愉快的回忆里。一九五一年本来小麦长的挺好，就是到收割的时候天天下雨，康拜因根本下不去地，事先又没有准备人工收割，因此把半数麦子扔到地里发了芽，结果是有了丰产没有得到丰收。
    一想到这里，落在帐篷上的雨点，就像敲打着每个人的心。
    但是，历史的教训，是不会让它重演的。一星期以前，第四生产队就来了三十多名割麦工人，镰刀的数目还多一倍。准备在必要时，队上除了留下炊事员作饭外，大家一齐动手割麦。虽然如此，年轻的康拜因手们，说什么也不甘心使镰刀，他们主张尽量多想办法，用机器收割。佟庆山当时就提议——今后以机车组为单位开小组会，专门研究“怎样才能在雨后割麦不陷车”。人们坐在汽车的司机室里，坐在康拜因的木伞下，研究雨后的新情况。
    傍晚，一阵西北风，刮散了满天乌云，人们都到后面岗上去看晚霞。忽然，拖拉机手周文连说：“二队的康拜因开起来了！”说着，他用手指着西山。人们一看，透过红色的光辉，像是两台康拜因在蠕动。这是因为二队有一部分沙土地，雨水容易渗透，一住雨就能收割。这一来可把佟庆山急坏了，他说：“明天咱们再不能下地，就开康拜因去支援二队。”天黑了，西山上又吐出了朵朵白光，康拜因在乘夜收割，把第四队的人们都闹得心花缭乱。

    第二天，一轮红日，把草原涂上一层金黄色的光芒。各种颜色的什样锦花都张开了圆脸，朝着人们笑。
    上午晒了半天，大家一吃完午饭，人们就都跑到自己的车上去了。李淑贤也没换作业服，就穿着花夹袄上车了。这是一台斯大林湼茨四号康拜因，驾驶员是二十一岁的青年团员方国才，另外还有一个助手。车一开动，谁也压抑不住脸上的欢笑。
    这台康拜因的引擎一着，一方面可以推动车身前进，一方面使作业部分操作。前面是收割台，就像理发用的推剪一样，刀片来回一锉，就把麦棵子割下来。经过滚龙一绞，就像大嘴里的舌头，把麦棵子送到肚子里。它的胃口就是脱谷部分，经过带牙的滚筒，先咬后碾，把麦粒都搓下来，再用筛子筛净，用风把麦皮吹走。这时，麦秸从屁股后边漏出来，麦粒跑到前边的斗子里去。一天割麦定额是九公顷。
    三台康拜因在麦地里往返奔驰，很像一艘一艘的轮船在海里航行。他们老早盼望的日子终于来了。佟庆山分明是咬着牙用劲操纵升降舵，但也掩盖不住眼里的笑意。拖拉机助手王志成不断吹着尖声的口哨，来表达他内心的高兴。比别人更忙的是汽车司机刘源，他必须开着卡车轮流到每台康拜因跟前去卸粮，然后送到晒麦场去。汽车用劲跑还供应不上，结果女拖拉机手彭亚伦把她那红马式的拖拉机开来了，后面带着个斗车，来帮助卸粮。这是台小型的胶轮拖拉机，周身都是红的，只有四个轮子是黑的。车架子挺高，一发动引擎，它就“突突”地颠起来，走的也快，真像一匹调皮的野马。她坐在它的脊背上，手把舵盘，眼睛一直望着远方，头发掠过耳边往后飘舞，很有几分女骑士的风度呢。
    在帐篷旁边，是光滑的晒麦场。麦子堆了满场，正需要好太阳来晒。本来晒麦场只有四个人工作，可是，你看吧，统计员、饲养员都拿起木锨来扬麦子，就连炒好了菜的炊事员也扎着围裙跑来帮忙。麦场上扬起一缕一缕的麦粒，在空中散成扇面形，又落在原来的地方，麦芒随风飘走，落在下风头人们的头巾上。
    ×　×　×
    夜间，倒霉的天气又下了一阵雨。第二天上午没有下地。各个机车组长分头去验地，挑那些不太泥泞的地方，只要勉强能拖住康拜因就行；宁肯用最慢的速度，也要争取开车。午间回来汇报情况的时候，都摇头说难免陷车。但是大家都有决心，不怕陷。
    “不陷就收割，陷住就往外拖！”老队长张树魁说。因为他年龄最大，全队都叫他老队长；其实，他今年还不满三十岁。
    “要紧的是时间！”来检查工作的作业区主任说：“现在是雨里抢粮，要抓住时间，尽量用机器，能割一块就割一块，能割一刀就割一刀。”
    刚刚割了一个往复，佟庆山的康拜因就陷到泥里了。大家拴铁链、垫木板，用了将近一个钟头，才把它拖出来。第二驾驶员和两个助手，按照个人预定的分工去保养车，佟庆山一时也没有停，就又拿着竿子去验地去了。
    佟庆山回来了，到处都是非常松软的湿土，无法载负康拜因的重量，怎么办呢？面对着这种情况，沉静了一片刻，佟庆山说：
    “我揣摩着地边上比较干些，风能吹进去。”
    “咱们搜边割，打破老规矩，不要往当中开道。”
    “对，‘蚕食’它！”
    康拜因又开动了。作业区主任和老队长亲自在前边验道，作向导。果然再没有陷车。
    傍晚，起风了，一团一团的黑云向东南方向滚去，风越大，黑云就越滚的快。
    “雨来了！”不知谁这么喊了一声。
    “不管它，车能走就干！”佟庆山咬着牙说。他们这时谁也顾不得看天气，他们只惦记一件事——大风会把麦子刮倒，收割就更麻烦。因此他们都尽量争取时间，一分钟也不放它过去。
    “开灯！”方国才的灯一亮，所有的车灯都亮了。收割台上的木翻轮继续转动，叫通亮的灯火一照，就像起伏不定的浪花，又像一堆吞吞吐吐的火舌。
    风越急了。雷声越响了。收割还在继续着。
    雨真要来了。区主任说：“再下雨，就在康拜因的轮子下面安装滑板，让轮子着地的面积加宽，就不易往下沉；再要下，咱们还有人工，有镰刀，麦子一定要收回来的。”
    让暴风雨来得更猛些吧！年轻而勇敢的战士们，在任何环境下都要把粮收到家的。
