    General Election and Newspapers

    The implementation of the system of people's congresses through general elections marks a new stage in the development of socialist democracy in our country and is an event of great historical significance in the political life of our people. And the grassroots elections are the foundation of the elections of the National People's Congress and the people's congresses at all local levels. In recent months, newspapers in various places have paid attention to the propaganda of the general election and have initially reflected the typical pilot projects and the face of the grassroots elections, which is absolutely necessary. Among them, the newspapers in the Southwest region have been promoting the election work earlier, and the propaganda has been more sufficient and powerful; Sichuan Daily is an example.

    Sichuan Daily closely cooperated with the progress of the local general election work. Starting from the end of April, it successively reported on the deployment of the general election work in Sichuan Province and the progress of various preparatory works. As the typical pilot project of the grassroots elections in 137 cities and counties in the province was launched, the newspaper focused on reporting on the grassroots election situation and experience of the pilot areas, especially the four townships including Shuanglong Township in Jiangjin County, which were directly controlled by the provincial leading organs, in June. After July, on the one hand, the newspaper vigorously reflected the new atmosphere that emerged after the general election in the above-mentioned pilot areas. On the other hand, it turned to the propaganda of the first phase of grassroots election work in the province, which had been officially launched in an area of more than 10 million people. The characteristics of Sichuan Daily in this propaganda are: it fully explained the significance of the general election and the relevant laws, policies and working methods, and vividly reflected the election activities of the people, so that this propaganda has a greater inspiring force.

    The system of people's congresses through general elections is the fundamental system of our country, and the implementation of this system is the fundamental requirement of our people. Because of this, the significance of the general election work is even more significant, and our country is currently conducting the first large-scale general election. The broad masses of the people lack experience in this regard. Therefore, it has become a major task for newspapers to carry out in-depth propaganda to the people on the great significance of implementing the general election, explain the relevant principles and policies of the general election, and introduce the correct practices of the general election work. Sichuan Daily has made certain efforts in this regard. First of all, when the first phase of grassroots elections in Sichuan Province was launched, the newspaper published a series of "Speeches on General Election Work." These "speeches" not only briefly explained the superiority of the system of people's congresses, the necessity and possibility of implementing the general election, and the basic principles of the "Electoral Law" in relatively simple language, but also combined with the ideological situation of local cadres and the masses to put forward and answer the actual problems that the masses and cadres are most concerned about, such as whether the general election will delay production, how the people should treat the original grassroots cadres, and how the existing grassroots cadres should treat the election. For example, in the eleventh lecture, the newspaper put forward a correct and comprehensive view on treating the original grassroots cadres, pointing out that a few lawbreakers and discipline violators should be removed from the grassroots regime in the general election, and at the same time criticizing the attitude of "kicking out all cadres with shortcomings." In the sixteenth lecture, it analyzed the mistakes of some grassroots cadres who believed that the general election was "rectifying cadres" and "a major reshuffle," and therefore slackened their work, pointing out that grassroots cadres should dispel their worries, actively lead the masses to produce, and strive to be elected in the general election. Undoubtedly, these short, popular, and practical "speeches" are helpful for the broad masses of the people to correctly understand the significance of the general election and actively participate in this movement.

    On the other hand, in order to guide the movement and educate cadres and the masses, Sichuan Daily pointed out the problems in the general election movement in a timely manner and disseminated the correct work experience. In the grassroots elections, the first thing to be solved is the issue of combining the general election with production. Sichuan Daily seized this key issue. In addition to repeatedly explaining the relationship between democratic construction and production construction and emphasizing that grassroots elections must be closely combined with production in the relevant reports on the deployment of grassroots election work by the provincial leading organs, it also carried out vivid propaganda through practical examples of typical pilot projects of grassroots elections in various places. For example, on June 12, the newspaper used the fact that the general election working team of Yongxing Township, Mianyang County, started from actively leading the masses to produce, which not only smoothly carried out the general election, but also promoted production, and the fact that Jinquan Township, Pi County, carried out the general election in isolation, which seriously hindered agricultural production and the development of the general election, and published a short commentary, pointing out: "Only by closely combining with production can the general election be carried out smoothly." The article "How Shuanglong Township Closely Combines the General Election with Production" on June 21 gave a detailed introduction to the combination process of each link of the general election activities and the production work. Through these reports, the newspaper not only affirmed the principle that the general election must be combined with production, but also specifically answered the question of how to combine the general election with production.

    In addition to the introduction of experience in conducting elections in conjunction with production, Sichuan Daily also seized the main links of the work and relatively fully introduced many other experiences in the province's grassroots election pilot work. Among them, the most important are: fully mobilizing and relying on existing rural organizations and existing cadres to do a good job in grassroots election work; starting from correctly solving the relationship between rural cadres and the masses to smoothly deliberate on candidates; combining step by step with agricultural activities and each stage of the general election work to carry out in-depth and meticulous propaganda, and so on. The rich experience that emerged in the typical pilot work of grassroots elections has become an important reference for the province to officially launch the grassroots election work. In order to vigorously promote these experiences, the newspaper also published a series of editorials in July, such as "Learn from the Experience of Township Election Pilot Work and Healthily Carry out the General Election Movement," "Mobilize and Rely on Rural Cadres to Do a Good Job in General Election Work," and "Strengthen Grassroots Election Propaganda Work." It is worth mentioning that many of the reports on the experience of general election work introduced by Sichuan Daily are promoted through mass activities and work results. This is not only more convincing, thereby effectively guiding the work; but also a vivid education for the broad masses of the people, so that people can more thoroughly understand the principles, policies and practices of the general election through these reports, thereby enthusiastically participating in this movement.

    Another major task of newspapers in carrying out general election propaganda is to deeply reflect the political enthusiasm of the people in actively participating in the election movement, as well as the great impact of this historically significant event on national construction and people's lives. On the one hand, Sichuan Daily conducted a more systematic and comprehensive report on the typical pilot project of grassroots elections and the development of the first phase of grassroots elections in the province, introducing the progress, scale, momentum and achievements of the movement; on the other hand, it seized the key areas such as Shuanglong Township in Jiangjin County, Gongnong Township in Neijiang County, Yufeng Township in Suining County, and Hesheng Township in Wenjiang County, as well as the old revolutionary base areas in Sichuan and Shaanxi, and the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, and more deeply portrayed the face of grassroots elections. For example, there are a series of reports reflecting the election activities of the people in Shuanglong Township, Jiangjin County, such as "Gongnong Township and Shuanglong Township Complete the General Election," "The Day of the Election," "The Most Vivid Democratic Education," "Grandma Lei Has Changed," and "People's Representative Xia Zhiqing Leads Us to Overcome the Drought." In these reports, people saw how the people of the township warmly supported the general election, carefully reviewed the qualifications of voters, prudently deliberated and proposed candidates for representatives, and actively participated in the voting at the election meeting. As a result of the election, outstanding elements who were active in their work and impartial in their affairs were elected as representatives. For example, representative Li Jianzhang was originally a special model in the armed forces. After being transferred to the local area, he served as the township head, and later as the party branch secretary. He has always been supported by the masses. This time he was elected as a people's representative of the township, and was elected as the township head at the first meeting of the township people's congress. The elected representatives also took care of all classes. Among the 49 representatives, 32 were from the original poor peasants and hired peasants, 11 were from middle peasants, 3 were small businessmen, and 1 each were workers, handicraftsmen and primary school teachers; among them, women representatives accounted for 20%. The newspaper used vivid facts to show the high political consciousness of the people who have more than three years of democratic political life experience, their concern for the people's regime and their awareness of participating in the election.

    From the practice of the general election, what is the superiority of the people's congress through general election? What changes have been caused among cadres and the people after the general election? What is the relationship between the general election and national construction? These are issues that the broad masses of the people are very concerned about, and they are also issues that newspapers need to explain in depth. Sichuan Daily answered these questions specifically from many aspects through many reports. The "Victory of the General Election" published on July 3 vividly depicted the new atmosphere of the strengthening of the grassroots regime, the transformation of the work style of cadres, the improvement of the people's political enthusiasm and the promotion of production in Gongnong Township, Neijiang County, which had undergone the general election. The newspaper wrote: "The first task facing the township people's government after it was elected was to fight drought and protect seedlings." Then it compared the situation of cadres leading the fight against drought last year and this year: last year, when fighting drought, cadres subjectively used coercive methods to "mobilize" more than 80% of the adults and children in the township, and dispatched more than 120 waterwheels to carpool water for drought resistance in the Tuojiang River, which was 20 miles away. As a result, it took a month to irrigate only 20 dan of fields. The local people believed that such drought resistance was a waste of manpower and money, and were very dissatisfied. This year, after the general election, due to the simplification of the grassroots regime, flexible leadership, clear and reasonable division of labor among cadres, especially the cadres were deeply educated under the identification of the masses, and established a democratic work style of discussing things with the masses, so the drought resistance work was very different from last year. The township people's government first studied the opinions of the masses and decided to take water on the spot as a principle, and first carpooled pond water for first aid; it advocated voluntary exchange of work and mutual assistance in drought resistance, and did not forcibly organize "drought resistance teams"; and through the masses, it formulated reasonable water use methods; the members of the township people's government and the people's representatives of each village divided their work and went deep into the groups to give specific guidance; in this way, the township only dispatched the equivalent of one-fifth of the labor force and two-thirds of the waterwheels when fighting drought last year, but irrigated more than 2,000 dan of drought fields in ten days. Therefore, the farmers reflected: "The people's representatives elected this time are really satisfactory." They expressed their greatest trust in the representatives and the government they elected. This vividly shows that the great general election movement to elect state power organs from bottom to top has begun to achieve the effect of "uniting the masses, educating cadres, strengthening the ties between the people's government and the people, and further consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship."

    At present, the election of grassroots regimes is being widely launched in vast areas of our country. Except for some areas such as Shanxi and Hebei provinces where the general election work is still in the pilot stage due to the division of townships, many areas are already conducting the first phase of grassroots elections; in some areas with faster work progress such as Sichuan, Xikang, and Jiangxi provinces, the first phase of grassroots elections has basically ended, and the second phase of grassroots elections is about to be launched on a larger scale. Doing a good job in grassroots election work is the key to doing a good job in the entire election work; newspapers should pay special attention to the propaganda of grassroots elections. Seize the typical pilot areas to systematically reflect the face of grassroots elections, so that it can establish a vivid example among the people; as the grassroots elections are promoted from typical pilot projects to the vast rural areas and cities and towns, reflect the great political conscious activities of people of all strata from more aspects with distinctive features and rich content, and use concrete and accurate facts to deeply explain the great significance and practical effects of the general election, in order to encourage millions of people to participate in political and economic construction more actively and enthusiastically - this is the goal that our newspapers should continue to strive for in the propaganda of grassroots elections.

专栏：报纸工作述评

    普选和报纸
    普选的人民代表大会制度的实行，标志着我国人民民主政治发展的新阶段，是我国人民政治生活中一个具有伟大历史意义的事件。而基层选举又是全国及地方各级人民代表大会选举的基础。近几个月来各地报纸都已注意了普选的宣传，并初步反映了基层选举典型试办和基层选举的面貌，这是完全必要的。其中西南地区的报纸，由于当地选举工作开展较早，宣传得也较为充分、有力；四川日报就是一个例子。
    四川日报紧密配合当地普选工作的进展，从四月下旬开始，陆续报道了四川省关于普选工作的部署和各项准备工作的进行；随着该省一百三十七个市、县基层选举典型试办工作的展开，报纸在六月份着重报道了试办地区特别是省级领导机关直接掌握的江津县双龙乡等四个乡的基层选举情况和经验；七月份以后，该报一方面大力反映上述试办地区经过普选出现的新气象，另一方面转入业已在一千余万人口地区正式开展的该省第一期基层选举工作的宣传。四川日报在这一宣传中的特点是：比较充分地阐明了普选的意义和有关的法令、政策及工作方法，比较生动地反映了人民群众的选举活动，从而使得这一宣传具有较大的鼓舞力量。
    普选的人民代表大会制度是我们国家的根本制度，实行这一制度是我国人民的根本要求。正因为这样，普选工作的意义就更加重大，而我国目前进行第一次大规模的普选，广大人民在这方面缺少经验，因此向人民群众深入宣传实行普选的伟大意义，阐明有关普选的方针、政策，并介绍普选工作的正确作法，就成为报纸进行普选宣传的一项重大任务。四川日报在这方面曾作了一定的努力。首先，当四川省第一期基层选举展开时，该报曾连续发表“普选工作讲话”。这些“讲话”不仅以比较通俗的语言简明扼要地解释了人民代表大会制度的优越性，实行普选的必要和可能，“选举法”的基本原则等问题，而且结合当地干部、群众的思想情况，提出和解答了普选会不会耽搁生产、人民群众如何对待原有基层干部以及现有基层干部如何对待选举等群众和干部最关心的实际问题。如在第十一讲中，该报就曾提出对待原有基层干部的正确、全面的看法，指明在普选中应把少数违法乱纪分子从基层政权中清除出去，同时也批判了那种“把凡是有缺点的干部都一脚踢开”的态度；在第十六讲中则分析了部分基层干部认为普选是“整干部”、
  “大换班”因而工作松劲的错误，指出基层干部应解除顾虑，积极领导群众生产，争取在普选中当选。无疑，这些通俗短小、结合实际的“讲话”，对于广大群众正确理解普选意义和积极参加这一运动是有帮助的。
    在另一方面，为了指导运动，并教育干部和群众，四川日报比较适时地指出了普选运动中的问题，传播了正确的工作经验。在基层选举中，首先要解决的是普选与生产结合进行的问题。四川日报抓住了这一关键问题，除在有关该省领导机关对基层选举工作布置等报道中，反复阐明民主建设与生产建设的关系，强调基层选举必须紧密结合生产进行外，更通过各地基层选举典型试办的实际例子，进行了生动的宣传。例如六月十二日该报就曾以绵阳县永兴乡普选工作队从积极领导群众生产着手，既顺利地开展了普选，又推动了生产的事实，和郫县金泉乡孤立进行普选，结果严重妨碍农业生产和普选开展的事实进行对比，并发表短评，指出：“只有紧密结合生产，普选才能顺利开展”。六月二十一日“双龙乡普选怎样和生产紧密结合进行的”一稿，更对普选活动的每一环节与生产工作的结合过程作了细致的介绍。报纸通过这些报道，不仅肯定了普选必须结合生产进行的方针，而且具体地回答了普选与生产如何结合进行的问题。
    除结合生产进行选举的经验介绍以外，四川日报还抓住工作的主要环节，较为充分地介绍了该省基层选举试办工作中的其他许多经验。其中最重要的如：充分发动与依靠乡村现有组织、现有干部以做好基层选举工作的经验；从正确解决乡村干部与群众的关系入手，以顺利酝酿候选人的经验；步步结合农事活动和普选每一阶段的工作，深入细致地进行宣传的经验等等。基层选举典型试办工作中出现的丰富经验，成了该省正式开展基层选举工作的重要借鉴。为大力推广这些经验，该报并曾在七月份连续发表“吸取乡选试办工作经验，健康地开展普选运动”、“发动与依靠农村干部作好普选工作”、“加强基层选举宣传工作”等社论。值得提出的是，四川日报介绍普选工作经验的报道中，有很多是通过群众活动和工作效果来进行宣传的。这就不仅更加具有说服力量，从而有效地指导了工作；而且对于广大人民群众也是一种生动的教育，使得人们通过这些报道更加透彻地领会普选的方针、政策和作法，从而热烈地投入这一运动。
    报纸进行普选宣传的另一重大任务，在于深刻反映人民群众积极参加选举运动的政治热情，以及这一具有伟大历史意义的事件对于国家建设和人民生活的巨大影响。四川日报一方面对该省基层选举典型试办情况和第一期基层选举开展情况进行了比较系统的综合报道，介绍了运动发展的进程、规模、声势和成果；另一方面抓住江津县双龙乡、内江县工农乡、遂宁县玉峰乡、温江县和盛乡等重点地区以及川陕革命老根据地、民族杂居区等有特点的地区，较为深刻地刻划了基层选举的面貌。例如反映江津县双龙乡人民群众选举活动的就有“工农乡、双龙乡完成普选”、“选举的一天”、“最生动的民主教育”、“雷大娘转变了”、“人民代表夏治清领导我们战胜了天干”等一系列的报道。在这些报道中，人们看到该乡人民如何热烈拥护普选，认真审查选民资格，审慎酝酿和提出代表候选人，积极参加选举大会投票。选举的结果，工作积极办事公正的优秀分子纷纷当选为代表。如代表黎建章原是武装部队中的特等模范，转到地方以后任乡长，以后又任党支部书记，一向为群众所拥戴，这次被选为乡人民代表，并在乡人民代表大会第一次会议上当选为乡长。选出的代表也照顾了各个阶层，四十九名代表中原贫农雇农成份的共三十二人，中农成份的十一人，小商人三人，工人、手工业者及小学教员各一人；其中妇女代表则占百分之二十。报纸用活生生的事实显示了有着三年多民主政治生活经验的人民群众的高度政治觉悟，他们对人民政权的关怀和参加选举的自觉性。
    从普选的实践看来，普选的人民代表大会的优越性何在？经过普选在干部和人民群众中引起了什么变化？普选对于国家建设究竟有何关系？这是广大群众十分关心的问题，也是报纸需要深刻阐明的问题。四川日报通过许多报道从多方面具体地解答了这些问题。七月三日发表的“普选的胜利”就鲜明地描绘出经过普选的内江县工农乡基层政权性能加强、干部作风转变、人民群众政治热情提高和生产推进等新气象。报纸写道：“乡人民政府选出后，摆在面前的第一件工作就是抗旱保苗。”接着以去年和今年干部领导抗旱的情况作了对比：去年抗旱时，干部主观地用强迫命令的办法，“动员”了全乡百分之八十以上的大人、小孩，出动了一百二十多架水车，到二十里路以外的沱江去车水抗旱，结果花了一个月的时间，只浇了二十挑田。当地群众认为这样的抗旱是劳民伤财，很不满意。而今年普选后，由于基层政权简化，领导灵活，干部分工明确合理，特别是干部在群众的鉴别下受到深刻的教育，树立了有事和群众商量的民主作风，因此抗旱工作与去年大不相同。乡人民政府首先研究了群众的意见，决定以就地取水为原则，先车堰塘水进行急救；抗旱中提倡自动换工互助，不硬性组织“抗旱队”；并通过群众，订出合理用水的办法；乡人民政府委员和各村人民代表则分工深入到组里去具体领导；这样全乡只出动了相当于去年抗旱时五分之一的劳动力和三分之二的水车，在十天内却灌了两千多挑旱田。因此农民反映：“这回选的人民代表，真是称心满意。”对自己选出的代表和政府表示了最大的信任。这就生动地表明，自下而上选举国家权力机关的伟大普选运动已开始收到“团结群众、教育干部、加强人民政府与人民群众的联系和进一步地巩固人民民主专政”的效果。
    目前基层政权的选举正在我国广大地区广泛展开。除部分地区如山西、河北等省因划乡关系普选工作还处在典型试办阶段外，很多地区已在进行第一期基层选举；在有些工作进展较快的地区如四川、西康、江西等省，第一期基层选举基本上已经结束，第二期基层选举即将以更大的规模展开。做好基层选举工作是做好整个选举工作的关键；报纸对于基层选举的宣传应该给予特别的注意。抓住典型试办地区来系统地反映基层选举的面貌，使之在人民群众中树立起活生生的榜样；随着基层选举从典型试办向广大农村和城、镇的推广，从更多的方面有特色地、内容丰富地反映各阶层人民的伟大政治自觉活动，并用具体确切的事实深刻阐明普选的重大意义和实际效果，以鼓舞千百万群众更加积极更加热情地参加政权建设和经济建设——这就是我们的报纸在基层选举宣传中应该继续努力的目标。
