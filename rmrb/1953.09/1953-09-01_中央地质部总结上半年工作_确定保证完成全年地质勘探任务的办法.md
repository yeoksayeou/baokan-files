    The Central Geological Department Summarizes First Half of Year's Work
    Determines Methods to Ensure Completion of Annual Geological Exploration Tasks
    The Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government convened a meeting of bureau chiefs and team leaders from August 13th to 25th, summarizing the work of the first half of the year and proposing methods to ensure the completion of the annual geological exploration tasks.
    The meeting believed that the geological exploration work had achieved great results in the past six months, initially changing the face of geological work and basically completing the country's tasks. This is the main aspect.
    The meeting also pointed out that there are still many shortcomings in the work. For example, there are phenomena of violating exploration procedures in geological work, and there is a lack of comprehensive collation and research in geological exploration and geological surveys; in terms of drilling work, there are shortcomings such as low quality, many accidents, low efficiency, and untimely financial supply.
    The meeting believed that in order to ensure the timely completion of various key exploration plans, and at the same time, to complete various general survey tasks, geological work must resolutely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts and strengthen comprehensive geological research in exploration; establish a command and technical responsibility system for drilling and tunneling, etc. In terms of prospecting work, drilling work must be strengthened first. Drilling work should focus on three main aspects: production management, improving technology, and ensuring supply. In terms of specific requirements, it is necessary to focus on improving core recovery rate and eliminating accidents. It is necessary to reverse the idea of simply pursuing drilling footage from all aspects. A responsibility system should be established in drilling work to overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible.
    In terms of laboratory work, it is necessary to improve analysis efficiency, reduce errors, and strictly conduct internal and external inspections to ensure the completion of quality and quantity tasks. The meeting also put forward improvement measures for geological data collation, employee education, and other aspects.
    At the meeting, He Changgong, Deputy Minister of Geology, made a report, initially proposing the guidelines and tasks for geological exploration work in 1954. This report will be revised based on the supplementary opinions put forward by everyone after the general meeting discussion.
    In view of the decentralization, mobility, and complexity of geological work, the Ministry of Geology is considering establishing an organization for political work. Its basic tasks are: to organize and mobilize all geological workers based on the Chinese Communist Party's guidelines and policies and the requirements of the national geological exploration plan, to systematically improve their ideological and political level, and strengthen the organizational work of the Party, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League, etc., to ensure and supervise the completion of the geological exploration tasks assigned by the state.

    中央地质部总结上半年工作
    确定保证完成全年地质勘探任务的办法
    中央人民政府地质部八月十三日到二十五日召开局长、队长会议，总结了上半年的工作，提出了保证完成全年地质勘探任务的办法。
    会议认为：半年多来，地质勘探工作获得了很大的成绩，初步改变了地质工作的面貌，基本上完成了国家的任务。这是主要的方面。
    会议也指出工作中还存在不少缺点。例如地质工作中有违反勘探程序的现象，地质勘探和地质调查中缺乏综合的整理研究；钻探工作方面存在质量低、事故多、效率不高和财务工作供应不及时等缺点。
    会议认为要保证按期完成各项重点的勘探计划，同时，完成各项普查任务，地质工作中必须坚决贯彻苏联专家建议，加强勘探中的地质综合研究工作；建立对钻探、坑探的指挥与技术责任制等。在探矿工作方面，首先必须加强钻探工作。钻探工作中应当抓住生产管理、提高技术、保证供应等三个主要环节。在具体要求上，必须以提高岩芯采取率和消灭事故为中心。要从各方面扭转单纯追求钻进尺数的思想。钻探工作上应该建立责任制度，克服无人负责现象。
    化验工作方面要提高分析效率减少差错，严格进行内外检查，以确保质量和数量的完成任务。地质资料整理工作、职工的教育工作等各方面，会议也都分别提出改进办法。
    会中，地质部副部长何长工做了报告，初步提出了一九五四年地质勘探工作的方针和任务。这一报告经大会讨论后，将根据大家提出的补充意见加以修改。
    鉴于地质工作的分散性、流动性和复杂性，地质部正考虑建立政治部工作的机构，其基本任务是：根据中国共产党的方针政策和国家地质勘探计划和要求，组织和发动全体地质工作人员，系统地提高思想水平与政治水平，加强党与工会、青年团等的组织工作，以保证和监督完成国家所交给的地质勘探任务。    （新华社）
