    Learning from This Year's Design Lessons
    Preparing to Better Complete the 1954 Design Tasks
    Wang Zhijia, Central Heavy Industry Ministry Design Company

    The Central Heavy Industry Ministry Design Company basically completed its 1953 design tasks by the end of July this year. In order to learn from the experience and lessons of the design process and to prepare for the work in 1954, we dispatched a construction site visit team in late July to Harbin, Shenyang, Anshan, and other places to widely solicit opinions on the design from construction units and construction departments.

    The on-site visit team was composed of party, administrative, trade union, Communist Youth League, and design personnel from the company. Before departure, each group drafted an outline for collecting opinions based on the projects they needed to understand. After arriving at the construction site, the visit team was warmly welcomed by the construction units and construction departments, and successfully held project symposiums. The construction units put forward comprehensive and systematic opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of the design. Subsequently, they went to the buildings that had been built and the sites under construction to talk with users, construction workers, and worker comrades, and listen to their opinions. According to the materials collected and sorted out by the groups, there are approximately 500 opinions in total. These opinions are of great help in improving the quality of design and raising the level of design thinking in the future. Based on the analysis of these materials, the main problems in the design are as follows:

    First, there is insufficient understanding of fully completing the state plan. The preparation of design documents should not only meet the state's requirements in terms of time, but more importantly, it should meet the requirements of the Party and the government in the design task book regarding political, economic, and technical aspects. However, our designers one-sidedly believed that completing the drawings on time by rushing was fulfilling the task. Therefore, they often simply rushed progress due to time constraints, neglecting quality. This time, during the investigation of the large-scale motor factory building designed in 1953 (one of the state's key projects), due to carelessness in the design, the load-bearing capacity of the factory building's foundation was miscalculated by fifty tons. Fortunately, it was discovered early enough to be corrected in time. Another example is the design of the Anshan Second Industrial School, which had to be rushed in eighteen days. At that time, the company did not deeply study whether it could be completed and carried out the design without geological data and without fully understanding the surrounding environment of the construction site, resulting in repeated rework of the general layout design. In addition, the school's water and power sources were not resolved, which delayed the construction period by more than a month. There were also many errors in the completed construction drawings, causing difficulties in construction.

    Second, there is a lack of comprehensive and correct understanding of economic accounting, and there is one-sided emphasis on "saving." We investigated several higher vocational schools designed in 1952 that have been built in Shenyang. The facade style of the classroom building is very unsightly. Soviet experts said: "This is a structuralist designer" (meaning that they do not consider the art, style, and beauty of the building); The roof truss design of the higher vocational school of the Construction Engineering Bureau, purely for the sake of "saving," used very thin wood for the roof truss with a span of more than eighteen meters. Now some of the bottom beams of the roof truss have cracks, and new ones have to be remade. Not only did it not achieve the purpose of saving, but it wasted more than 500 million yuan. The floor slab of the classroom of the Anshan Technical School only has a very thin cement slab for "saving," which cannot soundproof and affects classes.

    Third, there is a phenomenon of mechanically copying advanced Soviet design experience. For example, the large-scale motor factory building designed in 1953 is one of the state's key projects. The safety of the factory building is extremely important. The ground bearing capacity of the factory building's foundation should be 28 tons per square meter, but the design used 32 tons. Fortunately, Soviet experts made suggestions and corrected it. The reason why the ground bearing capacity was designed to be 4 tons more per square meter is that the designers did not thoroughly learn the Soviet specifications and did not consider the height of the groundwater level during the design, so they calculated it with wet soil. In fact, under normal circumstances, the soil cannot be wet. Soviet experts said: "The ground bearing capacity should be calculated with dry soil."

    Fourth, the mass viewpoint is not strong, and there is insufficient concern for the working people. For example, Harbin Institute of Technology is a six-story building, but the sloping roof has not been designed with protective railings, and it is easy for workers to fall and get injured when going up to repair the roof. The fire door of Anshan Second Industrial School opens inward, which will inevitably cause congestion and prevent people from going out in the event of a fire. This is a dangerous design. Neither Lishan Workers' Village nor another workers' village has garbage bins, resulting in garbage being dumped everywhere, affecting the health of residents. The design of the coal storage yard of the boiler room of the Shenyang Higher Vocational School did not consider whether it was convenient for workers to carry it, so it was made as high as a one-story house, which made it very difficult to transport coal. The workers said: "With the strength to carry the coal storage yard, it is better to carry it directly into the boiler room, which saves trouble." Now this coal storage yard is no longer used and has become a warehouse.

    Fifth, there is a lack of an attitude of investigation and research and seeking truth from facts. We investigated the dining hall kitchens of several higher vocational schools that have been built in Shenyang. According to the cooks, the chimney of the kitchen is too small and is often filled with black smoke; there is no drainage leak on the kitchen floor, and the water cannot flow out during cleaning; there is no vent skylight on the top of the kitchen, and it is steamy and people cannot see each other when cooking... Why is the design so unreasonable? It is because we are not familiar with kitchen life and do not conduct investigations and research, but design behind closed doors. In addition, there is a lack of investigation into building materials. For example, the sidewalk design of a factory adopted inexpensive slag concrete instead of asphalt pavement, but slag is not produced there, so it had to be transported from Benxi, which is very far away. Therefore, the originally cheap material is now very expensive. The specifications of wood and steel used in the design often do not match the actual situation, causing difficulties and waste. This phenomenon exists in the design of large-scale motor factories and standard dormitories.

    Finally, designers also lack a high degree of overall concept. The connection between various professional design disciplines is not enough, so the phenomenon of water pipes colliding with electrical wires and ventilation holes leading to beams still exists in these projects we investigated. Insufficient consideration is given to construction during the design, and the drawings are sloppy and have no dimensions, causing difficulties in construction. For example, the Soviet experts said that for the design of a large-scale motor factory, there should be more than 1,000 civil construction drawings, but we only have more than 100 drawings, and the length of many materials and components is not indicated, so we have to enlarge the samples on site during construction. There are no construction instructions, and the design says: "Construction according to the drawings and construction acceptance specifications." However, the drawings are not detailed, and the construction acceptance specifications cover too wide a range. Therefore, the construction can only be done by asking questions.

    Based on the above problems, we have organized three special research groups based on the visiting team, and studied Minister Wang's recent instructions on improving design thinking, to further clarify the current design thinking situation, clarify the design thinking problems that need to be solved in the future, so as to further improve the ideological level of designers, actively and correctly learn from Soviet experience, and lay the ideological foundation for completing the design tasks assigned to us by the state in 1954.

    吸取今年设计中的教训
    准备更好地完成一九五四年设计任务
    中央重工业部设计公司  王植家
    中央重工业部设计公司在今年七月末已基本完成了一九五三年的设计任务。为了吸取设计中的经验教训，迎接一九五四年的工作，我们在七月下旬派出了施工现场访问小组，分赴哈尔滨、沈阳、鞍山等地，广泛地征询建设单位及施工部门对设计的意见。
    现场访问小组由公司的党、行政、工会、青年团及设计人员组成。出发前各组根据所需要了解的工程拟订了搜集意见的提纲。访问小组到达工地后，受到了建设单位和施工部门的热烈欢迎，顺利地召开了工程座谈会，建设单位对设计的优缺点提出了较全面而系统的意见；随后又到已修建起来的建筑物和正在进行施工的现场，找用户和施工员及工人同志们谈话，倾听他们的意见。根据各组已搜集和整理好的材料，共有意见约五百条左右。这些意见对今后改进设计质量和提高设计思想水平，有很大的帮助。根据这些材料来分析，设计中的问题主要有以下几方面：
    首先，对全面完成国家计划认识不足。编制设计文件不仅在时间上要满足国家的要求，更重要的是要满足党和政府在设计计划任务书上所规定的关于政治、经济、技术三方面的要求。但我们设计人员却片面地认为能按时突击出图纸，就是完成了任务。因此常因时间紧迫而单纯赶进度，忽视了质量。这次调查一九五三年设计的大型电机厂房（是国家的重点工程之一），由于设计时粗枝大叶，竟把厂房基础的承重漏算了五十吨，幸而发现得早，得以及时补救。又如鞍钢第二工业学校的设计，要在十八天内突击完成。当时公司也没深入研究能否完成，就在没有地质资料，对建设地点周围环境没有充分了解的情况下进行了设计，造成了总平面布置设计的多次返工。此外，学校的水源、电源也没有解决，结果拖延了工期一个多月，做好的施工图纸差错也很多，造成了施工的困难。
    其次，是对经济核算缺乏全面的正确的认识，片面地强调“节省”。我们调查了一九五二年设计的已在沈阳修建起来的几个高等职业学校，教室大楼立面的式样很不好看。苏联专家说：“这是结构主义设计者”（意思指不考虑建筑的艺术、型式和美观）；建筑工程局高等职业学校的屋架设计，单纯为了“节省”，跨度十八公尺多长的屋架，木料用得很细，现在有的屋架底梁已出现了裂缝，只好重做新的，不但没达到节省的目的，反而浪费了五亿多元。鞍钢技工学校教室的楼板为了“节省”，只有一层很薄的水泥板，不能隔音，影响了上课。
    第三，学习苏联先进的设计经验有生搬硬套的现象。如一九五三年设计的大型电机厂房，是国家的重点工程之一，厂房的安全是极为重要的，厂房基础的地耐力每平方公尺应该用二十八吨，设计时却用了三十二吨，幸而苏联专家提出意见加以纠正了。地耐力每平方公尺所以多设计了四吨，是因为设计人员对苏联规范没有学透，设计时没有考虑地下水位的高低，就以湿土计算了。实际在正常情况下，土壤不可能是湿的，苏联专家说：“应该以干土计算地耐力。”
    第四，群众观点不强，对劳动人民的关怀不够。如哈尔滨工业大学是六层大楼，但斜坡屋顶却没有设计防险栏杆，工人上去修理屋面很容易摔伤。鞍钢第二工业学校的防火门向里开，如发生火灾时势必拥挤不出去，这是危险的设计。立山工人村和另一处工人村都没设垃圾箱，结果垃圾无处倒，弄得到处都是，影响了居民的健康。沈阳高等职业学校锅炉房贮煤库的设计，没考虑工人搬运时方便不方便，就做了一层平房高，运起煤来很吃力，工人说：“有背上煤库的力气，不如一直背进锅炉房里倒省事了”，现在这个贮煤库已不再使用，变成仓库了。
    第五，缺乏调查研究实事求是的态度。我们调查了在沈阳已经修建的几个高等职业学校的食堂厨房，据炊事员反映，厨房烟囱口太小，经常堵满黑烟；厨房的地面没有下水漏子，清洗时水流不出去；厨房顶上没有出气的天窗，做起饭来是热气腾腾对面不见人……。为什么设计得这样不合理呢？是因为我们不熟悉厨房的生活，又不去调查研究，闭门造车地进行设计所造成的。另外，缺乏对建筑材料的调查，如某一工厂的人行道路设计，采用了价廉的矿渣混凝土代替沥清油路面，但那儿不出矿渣，施工时只好从很远的本溪去运来，因而本来很便宜的材料现在成本很高。设计上采用的木材和钢材的规格往往与实际不符，造成了困难和浪费，大型电机厂和标准宿舍等设计中都有这样现象。
    最后，设计人员还缺乏高度的整体观念。各专业设计工种间的联系不够，因而我们调查的这些工程中，水管与电线相碰，通风洞通到梁上的现象仍然存在。设计时为施工考虑得不够，图纸马虎没注尺寸，造成了施工的困难。如大型电机厂的设计，据苏联专家说，像这样大的厂房，光土建施工图纸得有一千多张，而我们只有一百多张图纸，很多材料和构件的长度都没有注明，施工时只好现放大样。没有施工说明书，设计上说：“照图纸及施工验收规范施工”，但是图纸不详细，施工验收规范又包括太广，因而施工时只好是做到那里问到那里。
    根据上述问题，我们以访问小组为基础，组织了三个专题研究小组，并学习了最近中央重工业部王部长关于提高设计思想工作的指示，进一步摸清当前的设计思想情况，明确今后需要解决的设计思想问题，以便进一步提高设计人员的思想水平，积极地正确地学习苏联经验，为完成一九五四年国家交给我们的设计任务打下思想基础。
