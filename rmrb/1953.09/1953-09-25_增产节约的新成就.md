　　New Achievements in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

　　Datong Coal Mine Sets All-Time High Record

　　Since the Datong Coal Mine launched a production increase and economy drive on September 1st, the production efficiency of all employees has been improving daily. On the 15th, the entire mine created a record of exceeding the plan by 14.48%, and on the 17th, it created a new all-time high record of exceeding the plan by 16.19%. In order to quickly transport the accumulated coal to meet the needs of industrial construction in various parts of the country, the employees of the mine's operations section have continuously created new loading records. On the 16th, the employees of the Third Mine's operations section loaded 3,035 tons in one day, which is unprecedented.

　　During the competition, all employees paid special attention to safe production and cost reduction. Since September, the safety situation in the entire mine has significantly improved. Except for one serious injury accident in the Third Mine, all mines have eliminated major personal injury accidents, and minor injuries have also decreased compared to August. Mechanical and electrical workers have strengthened planned maintenance, reduced mechanical and electrical accidents, and ensured production. For example, in the first ten days of September, the time lost due to mechanical and electrical accidents in the Second Mine was reduced by 66% compared to the same period in August. In the first half of the month, Zhang Xishan's coal extraction team in the Third Mine saved the country more than 3.5 million yuan. Ma Liu Hai's tunneling team improved drilling techniques, reducing one blast hole, and saving five blasts each time except in water tunnels. During the competition, employees further consolidated labor discipline, and violations of operating procedures and safety regulations gradually decreased. For example, the attendance rate of the Third Mine reached over 95%. (Li Zixin)

　　Anshan Iron and Steel Works, Mineral Processing Plant, Sintering Section, Ma Dianxuan Team's Daily Output Exceeds Plan by 43%

　　After hearing the report on the launch of the production increase and economy drive, all workers of the Ma Dianxuan team in the sintering section of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Mineral Processing Plant conducted repeated discussions and determined specific methods for increasing production and practicing economy: First, in conjunction with the establishment of a responsibility system, further strengthen mechanical maintenance and improve mechanical operation rates; Second, the three shifts should unite and exchange experiences in a timely manner to achieve balanced production; Third, consolidate the team's advanced four-season material mixing method and advanced coal inspection, ore return, and water management method; Fourth, strengthen labor discipline, abide by operating procedures, and ensure safe production. After determining their goals, they worked hard to implement them. As a result, all workers in the team fully exceeded the state plan every day in September. In particular, on the 9th of this month, with the active efforts of all workers, a large amount of gas ash was used, creating a new record for the highest shift output ever in the sintering section, exceeding the state plan by 43.59%, and the quality fully met the specifications. This not only reduced the cost of sintered ore but also laid a favorable foundation for increasing production and practicing economy. (Wei Enling)

　　New Atmosphere Appears at the Public-Private Joint Venture Yongli Chemical Industry Company, Dagukou Plant

　　The employees of the Tianjin Public-Private Joint Venture Yongli Chemical Industry Company, Dagukou Plant, have launched a production increase and economy drive since the beginning of September, actively seeking methods and tapping potential to improve production efficiency. The average daily output of soda ash, the plant's main product, has exceeded the production increase plan by 4.7%, nearly doubling compared to before liberation; the average daily output of caustic soda has exceeded the production increase plan by 9.7%, increasing sixfold compared to before liberation. Both of these products have set the plant's highest record in more than 30 years since its establishment.

　　Tai Dong No. 1 Drilling Rig Creates a New Record of 61.45 Meters Drilled per Day

　　All employees of the Tai Dong No. 1 drilling rig of the Xi'an Mining Bureau Drilling Company actively responded to the call for a production increase and economy drive. On the 17th of this month, with a hole depth of 105 meters, using a hinged drill bit inlaid with cemented carbide drill steel, and appropriately using fast gears and adjusting the pressure inside the hole according to the rock formation, they created a new record of 61.45 meters drilled per day (exceeding the national planned efficiency by 514.5%, exceeding the company's work plan efficiency by 339%); they also created a new record of 95.69% core recovery rate in terms of quality (the national plan requires 75%, exceeding it by 20.69%).

　　The achievements of the No. 1 drilling rig encouraged and promoted the production enthusiasm of other drilling rig workers, opening up a path for the drilling company to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the 1953 drilling task. (Zhang Jiazhu)

　　Zigong Salt Making New Plant Construction Site Accelerates Progress and Ensures Project Quality

　　Since the launch of the production increase and economy drive, employees at the Zigong Salt Making New Plant construction site have proposed more than 100 rationalization proposals in less than half a month, improving labor efficiency and ensuring project quality. The efficiency of refractory stone chipping at the No. 1 project construction site has increased twofold, and the average completion rate of four projects in the second engineering team exceeded the quota by 200%. Mechanical installation workers used their brains to improve operations, and the cold work room increased fire tube production from half a tube per worker to eleven tubes per worker. The stone team, which previously had low labor attendance rates and failed to complete its plans, has also overfulfilled its tasks since the launch of the competition. The construction site formed a quality and safety inspection committee to actively carry out publicity and education. Since the competition, the working hours wasted due to rework accounted for only one three-thousandth of the total working hours, eliminating serious injury and death accidents, and minor injuries also decreased by one-third compared to last month. Many employees actively sought ways to save raw materials. Paint workers picked up more than 60 kilograms of iron parts from the ground and soil outside of working hours, and engineer Zhang Zuoru suggested improving brick-making materials, saving the country hundreds of millions of yuan in wealth. (Liu Yongneng)

　　State-owned Shanghai No. 14 Cotton Textile Factory Employees Strive to Improve Product Quality

　　More than 20 groups at the State-owned Shanghai No. 14 Cotton Textile Factory have launched a red flag competition to improve quality and ensure the comprehensive completion of the September production plan. These days, a dazzling red flag is flying in the roving workshop; it says: "Don't think I look good, if I don't master advanced working methods, I'll run away." When the workers saw it, they made up their minds: "Capture you and dedicate you to National Day." The third row of Class C and the first row of Class A in the roving workshop, who first proposed the challenge and responded to it, originally proposed that the measured performance of implementing the Hao Jianxiu work method should be guaranteed to be 83 points (administratively stipulated as 80 points), but now the measured performance every day is above 83 points, eliminating the phenomenon of failure, and individual rows have exceeded 90 points. Roving frame operators and piecers unite and help each other do cleaning work, and roller lapping has also decreased significantly. Because the workers in the weaving shop clearly recognized the importance of "quality first" ideologically, they also paid attention to improving product quality and did not produce substandard cloth. For example, worker Lin Judi produced 4% substandard cloth in August, but has not produced any substandard cloth since September, and his output has also maintained the highest level.

　　Fujiatan Coal Mine Horizontal Tunnel Continuously Overfulfills Production Tasks

　　The production situation in the Fujiatan Coal Mine horizontal tunnel was very poor from January to August, only completing 92.74% of the state task, and the quality was low, raw material consumption was high, and accidents occurred frequently (averaging 12 times per month). Since the launch of the production increase and economy drive in early September, thanks to the concerted efforts of all employees, the plan has been overfulfilled daily since the 8th. By the 18th, 93.64% of the entire month's plan had been completed. On September 17th, the tunnel created a new record of producing 1,000 tons per day. To celebrate the new achievements of the horizontal tunnel, Fujiatan Coal Mine held a congratulatory meeting. (Lai Xi, Gui Tian, Lai Yun, Gui Cai, Xiao Feng)

    增产节约的新成就
    大同煤矿创造全年最高纪录
    大同煤矿全体职工从九月一日展开增产节约竞赛以后，生产效率日日提高。十五日全矿创造了超计划百分之十四点四八的纪录，十七日又创造了超计划百分之十六点一九的全年最高新纪录。各矿营运股的职工为了很快运出积煤，供祖国各地工业建设需要，连续创造装车新纪录。三矿营运股的职工在十六日一天装了三千零三十五吨，这是从来没有过的现象。
    在竞赛中全体职工特别注意了安全生产与降低成本，九月以来全矿安全情况显著好转，除三矿出了一名重伤事故外，各矿都消灭了重大人身事故，轻伤事故也较八月份减少。机电工加强了计划检修，减少了机电事故，保证了生产，如二矿九月上旬机电事故所耽误生产的时间比八月份同期减少了百分之六十六。三矿张喜山回采组上半月就给国家节省了三百五十多万元，马六孩掘进组改进了打眼技术，减少了一个炮眼，除水巷外每次能节省五个炮。在竞赛中职工们进一步巩固了劳动纪律，违反操作规程和保安制度的现象逐渐减少。如三矿的出勤率达到了百分之九十五以上。　（李自新）
    鞍钢选矿厂烧结工段马殿选班日产量超过计划百分之四十三
    鞍钢选矿厂烧结工段马殿选班全体工人，自从听了开展增产节约竞赛的报告后，大家进行了反复讨论，确定了增产节约具体办法：一、结合建立责任制，进一步加强机械维护保养，提高机械运转率；二、三班互相团结，及时交流经验，做到均衡生产；三、巩固本班先进四季配料法与先进看煤返矿打水法；四、加强劳动纪律，遵守操作规程，保证安全生产。他们确定了奋斗目标以后，就努力贯彻，因此该班全体工人九月份每天都全面地超过了国家计划，特别是本月九日在全班工人的积极努力下，大量使用了瓦斯灰，创造了烧结工段从来没有过的班产量最高新纪录，超过国家计划百分之四十三点五九，质量完全合乎规格。这不仅降低了烧结矿成本，同时给增产节约打下有利基础。　（魏恩陵）
    公私合营永利化学工业公司沽厂出现新气象
    天津公私合营永利化学工业公司沽厂职工，从九月初展开了增产节约竞赛，积极找窍门、挖潜力，提高了生产效率。该厂的主要产品纯碱的平均日产量，已超过增产计划百分之四点七，比解放前增加了将近两倍；烧碱平均日产量超过增产计划百分之九点七，比解放前增加了六倍。这两种产品都创造了该厂建厂三十多年以来的最高纪录。
    太东一号钻机创造日进六十一点四五公尺的新纪录
    西安矿务局钻探公司太东一号钻机全体职工，积极响应了增产节约竞赛的号召。本月十七日，在孔深一百零五公尺的情况下，使用掰口式钻头镶硬质合金钻丝钢，并按岩层情况适当使用快车和调整孔内压力，创造了日进六十一点四五公尺的新纪录（超过国家计划效率百分之五百十四点五，超过公司作业计划效率的百分之三百三十九）；在质量上也创造了岩心采取率百分之九十五点六九的新纪录（国家计划要求为百分之七十五，超过百分之二十点六九）。
