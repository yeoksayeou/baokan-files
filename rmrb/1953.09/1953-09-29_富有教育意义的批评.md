Newspaper Roundup:

    The Dalian People's Daily, based on submissions and verbal feedback from nine readers of the Dalian Steel Plant and investigative material from its reporters, published criticism on July 23rd of the Dalian Steel Plant's failure to meet the state plan for six consecutive months this year, along with an editorial titled "State Plans Must Be Implemented Seriously." For the past half-year, the Dalian Steel Plant's weak planning management and failure to exploit its potential have affected the production of eighty-five ordering parties due to the underproduction of specialty steel alone. For example, the failure to deliver ball bearing steel on schedule affected the production of 30,000 sets of ball bearings in a ball bearing factory, thus preventing the installation and use of machinery in many factories. Similar situations exist in some other factories. The Dalian People's Daily's exposure of the serious harm to national construction caused by the Dalian Steel Plant's failure to meet the state plan is an instructive criticism.

    The newspaper vividly described the bureaucratic and administrative style of the Dalian Steel Plant's leadership and the chaotic phenomena in production management: only the factory director and a few people in the planning department knew the Dalian Steel Plant's plan; workers who had refined one batch of steel did not know what they would be refining next. Once, material was loaded into the furnace, only to have production suspended. The steel rolling workshop could not complete its production tasks, but the steel rolling machine added last year was left unattended for a long time. Installation only began in March of this year. The factory director was busy listening to reports, approving notes, and issuing gate passes; emphasizing objective difficulties and high state plans, and even arbitrarily reducing the state plan. The newspaper forcefully criticized this, citing the example of the steel ingot production shortfall in the steelmaking workshop from January to May this year due to low equipment utilization, high defect rates, and numerous accidents, which was greater than the figure owed to the state plan: "This proves that it is not that the plan is too high, but that production management is too bad, and subjective effort is too poor." Therefore, the leading cadres of the plant must not rely on empty talk, but on action to strive to complete the state production plan for the second half of the year.

    But as some criticisms have encountered, Comrade Yuan Zhizhong, director and party secretary of the Dalian Steel Plant, initially did not welcome criticism, but rather felt aggrieved, dissatisfied, and passively resistant, seeking reasons for rebuttal from trivial issues. In order to win and expand the effect of the criticism, the Dalian People's Daily made the following efforts: On July 26th, the newspaper published a symposium convened by the newspaper office of some factory cadres who had learned lessons from the steel plant incident, and news of steel plant workers supporting the newspaper's criticism. Then, from August 1st to September 1st, it established a column titled "Accept the Lessons of the Dalian Steel Plant and Resolutely Complete the State Plan," successively publishing more than ten self-criticisms from leading cadres and responsible personnel of six factories, including the steel plant. Sun Xuetang, deputy chief of the production section, and Ouyang Xiaoxi, deputy chief of the planning section, of the Electric Engineering No. 2 Factory (now known as the Dalian Electric Motor Factory) said in their article "Examining the Harm Caused to the Country by Our Factory's Failure to Complete the Plan" that they originally wanted to postpone the production of five products in the third quarter to the fourth quarter. After seeing the newspaper's criticism of the Dalian Steel Plant, they changed their original idea and did not put it in the fourth quarter. They would not only make the greatest effort to complete the orders for the third quarter, but also make up for the arrears of orders for the second quarter. Liu Maoyou, deputy director of the Second Glass Factory of the Construction Engineering Bureau, pointed out in his self-criticism that since liberation, they had only added a ball mill for producing raw materials in the auxiliary workshop last year, but they had completed a production figure more than three times that before liberation, and had continuously completed the plan. The self-criticism used this fact to powerfully refute the conservative thinking of some factory cadres who were shouting that the factory was "inherently deficient, the equipment was old, and the workers' technology was low." These articles in the newspaper that combined self-examination with introducing positive examples became a kind of ideological force for improving work. It not only promoted the work of the factory itself, but also enlightened and educated the leading cadres of the Dalian Steel Plant.

    Because the newspaper's criticism was supported by the workers and readers, and especially because of the help and supervision of the superior party committee and administrative organs to the plant before and after the newspaper's criticism, Comrade Yuan Zhizhong, director of the Dalian Steel Plant, made a relatively profound self-criticism. After the self-criticism, he took the time to go deep into the workshops and departments every day to understand the production work and personally led the important work of compiling and implementing operation plans. The plant also mobilized workers to discuss plans and carry out competitions, so after completing the state plan for July, it also overfulfilled the state plan for August. The newspaper published this news in a prominent position on August 13th and September 12th. It once again demonstrated to the vast number of readers this truth: unfolding mass criticism from the bottom up in newspapers is a powerful weapon for improving work.

    In order to summarize the education gained from this criticism, the editorial department of the newspaper published an article on September 12th entitled "Accept the Lessons of the Steel Plant and Resolutely Complete the Plan." The article said: "We should not only learn from the fact that the steel plant has not completed the plan for six consecutive months, but also learn from Comrade Yuan Zhizhong's attitude towards criticism, and constantly use criticism and self-criticism to overcome shortcomings in our work, and constantly promote our work forward!" Pointing this out is very necessary. We also remember that the editorial department of the newspaper made a "Review of the Issue of Unfolding Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers" in the newspaper on April 1st this year, pointing out in the review that "because our editorial department has relatively serious bureaucratic and liberalist problems in ideology and work," "the criticism and self-criticism carried out in newspapers is still far from the requirements of the party and national construction," and sometimes even "abandons the struggle." The criticism of the Dalian Steel Plant carried out by the newspaper this time should be a good start to "bravely take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism given to us by the party" and "keep the newspaper criticism regular," as mentioned in the review. Therefore, this criticism is also instructive for the newspaper editorial department.

### 富有教育意义的批评

    富有教育意义的批评
    旅大人民日报根据九位大连钢厂读者的来稿和口头反映以及该报记者的调查材料，在七月二十三日的报上，对大连钢厂今年上半年连续六个月没有完成国家计划的事实提出了批评，并发表了“必须严肃地执行国家计划”的社论。半年来大连钢厂由于计划管理薄弱和潜力未得到发挥，仅少产特殊钢一项就影响了八十五个订货户的生产。其中如滚珠钢材未能如期交货，就影响到生产滚珠工厂三万套滚珠的生产，因此使许多工厂的机器不能安装起来使用。类似的情况在其他一些工厂中也存在着。旅大人民日报选择大连钢厂没有完成国家计划严重危害国家建设的事例所进行的揭露，是一次富有教育意义的批评。
    报纸对大连钢厂领导上的官僚主义事务主义作风和生产管理中的混乱现象作了形象的描绘：大连钢厂的计划只有厂长和计划科的少数人才知道；工人炼了这炉钢不知道下一炉炼什么钢，有一次料装进了炉里也只好暂停生产。轧钢车间的生产任务完不成，但去年添来的轧钢机却长期无人负责安装，一直拖到今年三月才开始生产，厂长忙于听汇报、批条子、开门票；强调客观困难多，国家计划高，甚至擅自把国家计划减低。报纸在举出炼钢车间今年一至五月份因设备运用率低、废品多、事故多等项少产的钢锭，比差欠国家计划的数字还要多的例子时，有力地提出了批评：“这就证明并不是计划太高，而是生产管理太坏，主观努力太差。”因此，该厂领导干部必须不是靠空谈而要用行动来争取完成下半年的国家生产计划。
    但是正像一些批评所遭遇到的结果一样，大连钢厂的厂长兼党委书记袁执中同志，最初并不欢迎批评，而是抱屈不满，消极对抗，从枝节问题上找反驳的理由。旅大人民日报为了争取并扩大批评的效果，曾作了以下的努力：七月二十六日该报发表了由报社召开的部分工厂干部从钢厂事件中吸取的教训的座谈会和钢厂职工支持报纸批评的消息，接着又在八月一日到九月一日的一个月间，辟了“接受大连钢厂的教训，坚决完成国家计划”的专栏，连续发表了包括钢厂在内的六个工厂的十余个领导干部和负责人员的检讨文章。电工二厂（现名大连电机厂）生产科副科长孙学堂和计划科副科长欧阳效熙在“检查我厂没有完成计划给国家造成的危害”一文中说：他们本来想将第三季度中生产的五种产品推迟到第四季度去干。看到报纸对大连钢厂的批评后，就改变了原来的想法，没有放在第四季度内。他们不但要尽最大努力来完成第三季度的订货，还要补上第二季度的拖欠订货。建工局第二玻璃厂副厂长刘茂有在检讨中指出：他们在解放以来，在生产设备方面只去年在辅助车间添了一台生产原料的球磨机，但完成了超过解放前三倍的生产数字，并连续完成了计划。检讨用这一事实对有些工厂干部叫喊的工厂“先天不足、设备旧、工人技术低”的保守思想作了有力的反驳。报纸上这些结合本身工作进行检查和介绍积极事例的文章，就成了改进工作的一种思想力量。它既推动了本厂的工作，又启发和教育了大连钢厂的领导干部。
    由于报纸批评得到工人群众和读者的支持，也特别由于上级党委和行政机关在报纸批评前后对该厂的帮助和督促，大连钢厂厂长袁执中同志作出了比较深刻的检讨，并在检讨后每天抽出时间深入车间和科室了解生产工作情况，亲自领导编制和贯彻作业计划等重要工作。该厂又发动工人讨论计划开展竞赛，因而在完成七月份的国家计划之后，又超额完成了八月份的国家计划。该报在八月十三日和九月十二日以显著地位刊登了这项消息。它向广大读者又一次地展示了这个真理：在报纸上展开自下而上的群众批评，是改进工作的有力武器。
    为了总结这次批评中得到的教育，该报编辑部在九月十二日发表了“接受钢厂的教训，坚决完成计划”的文章。文中说：“我们不但要从钢厂连续六个月没有完成计划的事实中吸取教训，而且要从袁执中同志对待批评的态度中吸取教训，经常运用批评与自我批评来克服工作中的缺点，不断地推动我们的工作前进！”指出这一点是很必要的。我们还记得，该报编辑部在今年四月一日的报上曾作过
  “关于在报纸上展开批评与自我批评问题的检讨”，检讨中指出：“由于我们编辑部思想上工作上存有较严重的官僚主义和自由主义的毛病”“所以在报纸上所进行的批评与自我批评，还与党和国家建设事业的要求相距很远”，有时甚至“放弃斗争”。该报这次对大连钢厂所进行的批评，应是这个检讨中所说的“勇敢拿起党所交给我们的批评与自我批评的武器”，并使报纸批评“保持经常”的一个良好开端。因而这次批评对报纸编辑部说来，同样是有教育意义的。
