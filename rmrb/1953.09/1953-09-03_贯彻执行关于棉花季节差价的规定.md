    Implement Regulations on Cotton Seasonal Price Differences
    The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council announced the seasonal cotton price differences for 1953-1954 on August 30th. The regulations stipulate that the total range should be set at around 9%, with three increases occurring in early November, mid-to-late December, and after the Spring Festival: the price in early November will be 3.5% higher than the new cotton price in September, and will be raised again in mid-to-late December and after the Spring Festival. This regulation on cotton seasonal price differences is adapted to the requirements of China's current economic situation. It is a timely and reasonable measure designed to allow cotton farmers to sell cotton at their leisure, to rationally adjust the supply of autumn grain and industrial products to cotton farmers, to ensure that farmers who store cotton for later sale do not suffer losses, and to provide them with slight benefits.
    Over the past three years, the cotton supply situation in China has undergone significant changes. Encouraged by the state's highly favorable cotton price policy for developing cotton production, cotton farmers across the country, under the call and leadership of local Party and government organs, launched a patriotic production increase campaign. The total national cotton production increased from more than 8.8 million dan in 1949 to more than 25 million dan in 1952, reaching a level that can guarantee the supply of current national and people's needs. This is an important victory for the Chinese people on the economic front.
    As a result of increased cotton production, the state-controlled cotton reserves can now guarantee the needs of China's current cotton textile industry and civilian cotton wadding. This makes it possible for the state cotton purchasing work to gradually move into a normal state, organize cotton farmers to sell cotton in an orderly manner, and enable the state to carry out uniform and planned purchases according to needs. In the past, the state did not have seasonal price differences for cotton purchases, or the seasonal price differences were very small, which was necessary under the circumstances at the time. However, we can also recall that because there were no seasonal price differences in the past, cotton flooded the market excessively after the autumn harvest, causing state-owned trading departments and cooperatives to experience excessive crowding in warehousing, transportation, and other aspects of cotton purchasing work. This made it impossible for the state and cooperatives to carry out timely purchases, and the supply of materials could not keep up with the needs of the purchasing work, resulting in early cotton sellers suffering unnecessary losses of manpower and materials due to crowded cotton sales, and later sellers not being compensated for storage, preservation, and moisture drying losses. Therefore, the practice of not having seasonal price differences is not in line with the current reality of China's extreme seasonal consumption of various agricultural products and some industrial products; the lack of cotton seasonal price differences is also very detrimental to cotton farmers. The seasonal cotton price differences announced this year to next year will not only avoid the phenomenon of excessive cotton flooding the market after the autumn harvest, which was caused by the lack of seasonal price differences in the past, enabling state-owned trading departments and cooperatives in various places to better organize purchases and rationally adjust the supply of autumn grain and industrial products, but also allow farmers who store cotton for later sale to receive due compensation for storage and preservation losses due to the gradual increase in cotton seasonal price differences, avoiding losses and providing slight benefits. Therefore, the seasonal cotton price differences for this year to next year announced by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council are still based on safeguarding the interests of cotton farmers and supporting cotton farmers' production, as in the past.
    Because the state has adopted measures different from the past this year, maintaining reasonable seasonal price differences for cotton purchases, it is very important to carry out full political work among the farmers and explain the reasons for the state's adoption of this important measure clearly. To this end, Party committees and financial committees in various places should conduct full publicity among farmers to make cotton farmers, especially poor and middle peasants, understand the significance of the government's announced cotton seasonal price difference methods, and make cotton farmers understand that selling cotton gradually according to national needs is conducive to the state's planned purchases according to needs, and that gradually incorporating China's scattered individual small-scale agricultural production into the state's overall economic plan is beneficial to the country and to the cotton farmers themselves. As long as Party committees and cotton purchasing organs in various places earnestly carry out the necessary political work and explain the reasons to cotton farmers, we are fully confident that cotton farmers will understand from their own personal experience over the past few years that the various economic measures of the People's Government are aimed at developing production and safeguarding the interests of the people. Therefore, cotton farmers will certainly adopt a positive and supportive attitude towards the state's planned cotton purchasing measures, thereby selling cotton at their leisure and in an orderly manner according to the needs of the country.
    At the same time, local industrial and commercial administrative departments must pay close attention to the illegal speculative activities of profiteers and hoarders. Especially in the period of time before the seasonal price differences are to be increased, they may exploit the eagerness of poor peasants and some middle peasants to sell cotton, buy cotton, and then sell it to the state after the price increases to seek huge profits. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to conduct widespread publicity in cotton-producing areas to make cotton farmers understand the state's cotton purchasing policy this year and the state's positive and responsible attitude towards cotton purchasing, to educate cotton farmers to postpone selling cotton for a while, sell it step by step, sell less first and more later, and not to be deceived and exploited by profiteers and hoarders. The staff of the grassroots purchasing points that are in direct contact with cotton farmers must provide patient and correct explanations to cotton farmers. On the other hand, local administrative management agencies must conduct appropriate market management to prohibit the illegal speculative activities of profiteers and hoarders.
    State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives must actively organize the supply of industrial products to cotton-producing areas. The industrial products needed by farmers in cotton-producing areas must be delivered to rural areas in a planned and guaranteed manner, with full supply, so that the supply of materials can be adapted to the cotton purchasing work, which is conducive to the smooth progress of the state cotton purchasing work. Under the unified leadership of local Party committees, various financial and economic departments must strengthen publicity to cotton farmers and cooperate closely to correctly implement the seasonal price difference policy and ensure the victorious completion of the task.

### 贯彻执行关于棉花季节差价的规定

    贯彻执行关于棉花季节差价的规定
    政务院财政经济委员会在八月三十日公布了一九五三年到一九五四年的棉花季节差价。规定其总幅度定在百分之九左右，在十一月初旬、十二月中、下旬和春节后分三次上提：十一月初比九月新棉价提高百分之三·五，到十二月中、下旬和春节后再各提一次。这次棉花季节差价的规定，是适应我国当前经济情势的要求的，是为了使棉农可以从容出售棉花，对棉农合理调节秋粮与工业品的供应，并使存棉缓售的农民不致吃亏，且稍稍有利的及时的合理措施。
    三年多来，我国棉花供应情况已起了重大的改变。由于在国家的对发展棉花生产极为有利的棉价政策的鼓舞下，全国棉农在各地党政机关的号召和领导下展开爱国增产运动，全国棉花总产量自一九四九年的八百八十多万担增加到一九五二年的二千五百万担以上，已达到能够保证供应目前国家和人民需要的水平。这是我国人民在经济战线上一个重要的胜利。
    棉花增产的结果，国家掌握的存棉已能够保证我国目前棉纺织工业和民用絮棉的需要，这就有可能使国家收棉工作逐渐纳入正常的状态，组织棉农有秩序地售棉，使国家根据需要进行均匀的、有计划的收购。过去国家收购棉花没有季节差价，或季节差价很小，这在当时的情况下是有必要的。但我们也可以回忆一下，由于过去没有季节差价，因而秋收后棉花过多地涌入市场，使得国营贸易部门和合作社在收购棉花工作中对仓储保管、交通运输等都发生过分拥挤的现象，使得国家和合作社来不及及时进行收购，而物资供应工作也跟不上收购工作的需要，以致早卖棉花的农民因售棉拥挤而遭受了人力、物力的不必要的损失，后卖者因存棉保管和水分干燥等损耗得不到补偿。因此，没有季节差价的做法，在目前是不符合我国各种农产品和若干工业品还存在着极大的季节性消费的实际情况的；没有棉花季节差价，对棉农也是很不利的。此次公布的今年到明年的棉花季节差价，不但可使以往因无季节差价因而造成秋收后棉花过多地涌入市场的现象得以避免，使得各地国营贸易部门，合作社能够更好地组织收购和合理地调节秋粮与工业品的供应，并且可使存棉缓售的农民因棉花季节差价的分次上提，使存棉保管的损耗得到应有的补偿，不致吃亏，并稍有利。因此，政务院财政经济委员会此次公布的今年到明年的棉花季节差价，仍和过去一样是从维护棉农利益和扶植棉农生产出发的。
    由于国家今年采取了和以往不同的、收购棉花保持有合理的季节差价的措施，在农民中进行充分的政治工作，把国家采取这一重要措施的道理讲清楚，是十分重要的。为此，各地党委和财委应在农民中进行充分宣传，使棉农，特别是贫农和中农了解政府公布的棉花季节差价办法的意义，使棉农懂得：根据国家需要陆续售棉，以利国家根据需要有计划的收购，使我国分散的个体的小农生产逐渐导入国家总的经济计划中，这样对国家有利并对棉农自己也有利的。只要各地党委及棉花收购机关认真地进行了必要的政治工作，对棉农讲清道理，我们充分相信：棉农是会从自己几年来切身的经验中，了解到人民政府的各项经济措施，是旨在发展生产，维护人民的利益的，因而棉农们也就一定会对国家有计划地收购棉花的措施采取积极拥护的态度，从而根据国家的需要，从容地、有秩序地出售棉花的。
    与此同时，各地工商行政部门必须严密注意奸商和囤积牟利分子投机的非法行为。特别在季节差价将上提以前的若干时间内，他们可能钻贫农、及一部分中农急于出售棉花的空子，买进棉花，到提价后再卖给国家，图取厚利。因此，一方面必须在棉区进行普遍宣传，使棉农懂得国家今年收购棉花的政策，以及国家对收购棉花的积极负责的态度，教育棉农稍为推迟一些时间，按步出售棉花，先少卖，后多卖，不要受奸商和囤积牟利分子的欺骗剥削，与棉农直接接触的基层收购点的工作人员，特别要对棉农进行耐心的正确的解释；而另方面，各地行政管理机构，必须进行适当的市场管理，以禁止奸商和囤积牟利分子投机的非法行为。
    国营商业部门与合作社必须积极组织对棉区的工业品供应，对于棉区农民所需要的工业品，必须有计划地有保证地送到农村，充分供应，使物资供应工作能够和棉花收购工作相适应，有利于国家棉花收购工作的顺利进行。各财经部门必须在各地党委统一领导下，加强对棉农的宣传，并密切配合，正确地贯彻执行季节差价政策，并保证胜利的完成任务。
