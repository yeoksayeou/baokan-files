    Commemorating the Great Russian Writer Leo Tolstoy
    Yu Jie
    Today (September 9th) is the 125th anniversary of the birth of Leo Tolstoy, one of Russia's and the world's greatest writers.

    Lenin saw that among the Russian writers of the revolutionary period, only Tolstoy's works broadly and profoundly reflected the most significant era in Russian history at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century—that is, the era of preparation for the first Russian Revolution of world significance. Therefore, Lenin said that Tolstoy was the mirror of the Russian Revolution. This is the reason for the greatness of this genius writer.

    Tolstoy was born in 1828 and died in 1910. He engaged in literary activities for nearly sixty years, occupying a long period in Russian history. At the time of his birth, the Decemberist aristocratic revolutionary movement of 1825, which opposed autocratic politics, awakened Russia's advanced elements to rise up against the serf system. During his childhood, the revolutionary ideas of the revolutionary democrats Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, and Dobrolyubov played a dominant role in Russia's progressive circles. Tolstoy participated in the defense of Sevastopol. And the Crimean War of 1853-1856 exposed the corruption of the Tsarist government and the complete bankruptcy of the serf system. The so-called reform of the "liberation" of serfs in 1861 was the beginning of the vigorous development of capitalism in Russia. This reform not only did not improve the people's lives, but in many places plunged them into even more difficult circumstances, and therefore, at the same time, it stimulated the development of the revolutionary movement. Tolstoy's later years passed during the period of the first Russian Revolution of 1905. This period marked a new stage in the people's liberation movement against capitalists and landlords under the leadership of the proletariat.

    All these huge historical events, this process of the thorough destruction of the rotten foundation of Tsarist Russia, left a deep mark on Tolstoy's lifelong thinking and creation.

    Tolstoy wrote many works in his lifetime. As early as 1852, when the serf law had not yet been abolished, Tolstoy had already begun his literary career. In his early creative activities, he wrote the autobiographical trilogy "Childhood," "Boyhood," and "Youth," many war novels, the most famous of which is "Sevastopol Sketches," and a novel describing serfs and landlords, "A Landowner's Morning." His early works attracted the attention of the Russian literary world as soon as they appeared. Chernyshevsky greatly appreciated his talent, saying that he was a master of psychological analysis and possessed genuine and pure moral sentiments.

    At the end of 1863, Tolstoy began to write his long masterpiece "War and Peace." He completed this historical novel with the War of 1812 as its background at an astonishing speed within six years. This novel, in terms of the richness of its content and the superbness of its artistic skills, can be said to be a rare and great work in the history of world literature.

    In "War and Peace," we not only see Tolstoy's high skill in portraying characters and his great power in realistically depicting historical events, but also see the author's trust in the power of the people and his patriotic spirit. The real protagonist of "War and Peace" is the Russian people who defended the land of their motherland and its honor and freedom to resist violent enemies. The Patriotic War of the Russian people against Napoleon's army in 1812 is depicted in "War and Peace" as a people's, self-defensive, and therefore just war. Tolstoy first regarded the Battle of Borodino, which played a decisive role in this war, as the victory of the Russian people over the enemy in moral spirit, and the failure of the French invaders as the result of the moral disintegration of the French army pursuing plundering goals. Here, Tolstoy also profoundly expressed the important role played by the guerrillas in this war.

    In "War and Peace," Tolstoy's understanding of the role and significance of military commanders is incorrect, and he excessively reduces the influence of commanders on war. But before Tolstoy, no one was able to understand Kutuzov as correctly as he did. He portrayed him as a true, wise, people's war commander, the embodiment of the national spirit that guaranteed victory for the Russian army. After reading "War and Peace," we will believe that Kutuzov relied on a very carefully planned counteroffensive to defeat Napoleon and his army.

    Completely opposite to Kutuzov, Napoleon in Tolstoy's writing is a stubborn and self-willed figure who has no connection with his people and believes that only he himself is without fault.

    Every positive character in the novel has the power of patriotism that the Russian people demonstrated in the Patriotic War of 1812. They combine their own interests and feelings with the interests and feelings of the people, so they are spiritually elevated and find the meaning of life.

    What attracts us in the artistic image of "War and Peace" is not only the profound description of characters and historical events, but also the optimistic spirit of affirming life. In this novel, not only in the depiction of the Russian army and the Russian people defeating the enemy, but also in the scenes of personal private life, are full of this joyful, healthy, and life-affirming spirit.

    All the artistic stylistic characteristics of Tolstoy's previous creations have been further developed in "War and Peace." The depth and thoroughness of psychological analysis, the precise depiction of characters using their expressions, postures, and movements, the use of various typical details in character images, natural scenery, and war scenes, and finally, the high realism artistic inherent in the entire novel—all of this demonstrates Tolstoy's artistic skills having made new and significant progress in "War and Peace."

    From 1873 to 1877, Tolstoy wrote the novel "Anna Karenina." This is a masterpiece comparable to "War and Peace" in terms of ideological depth and writing skills.

    When Tolstoy began planning to write "Anna Karenina," he originally only wanted to describe the tragic fate of a married woman. But in the process of writing, the scope of the novel became wider and wider, and finally it became a novel reflecting the Russian life of an entire era.

    In this novel, Tolstoy answered many questions that were of concern to Russian social figures at the time, such as questions of science and philosophy, questions of art, questions of history and politics, questions of government policy, social issues, etc., which were more or less answered in the novel. The moral and psychological theme that served as the foundation of the novel's conception was resolved only after it was included in the social theme. Therefore, "Anna Karenina" is a novel reflecting family life, and at the same time it has become a novel reflecting the entire society.

    Tolstoy used amazing skills to describe the tragedy of a young woman. In order to pursue true happiness, she was sacrificed under the hypocritical and cold oppression of high society.

    The novel depicts a picture of the life of all strata of Russian society at that time—from the upper aristocratic class to the peasants. The fate of all the characters is closely related to the times of the 1870s.

    The characters in the novel all want to create their own happiness in terms of love, family, and social undertakings, but they all fail. The love between Anna and Vronsky created a tragedy. Even the love between Levin and Kitty, which initially seemed very bright and solid, became empty and unsatisfactory after marriage. Levin enthusiastically and intensely managed economic undertakings, and he attempted to participate in social activities, but like his love, he could not free him from his spiritual distress. The other characters such as Karenin, Oblonsky, Dolly, etc. are also like this.

    In "Anna Karenina," profound thought is organically combined with amazing literary and artistic skills. In terms of the power and skill of depicting characters and their inner experiences, distress, excitement, worries, spiritual pursuits and fluctuations, this novel is no less than "War and Peace."

    In the 1870s, around the time of completing "Anna Karenina," Tolstoy's outlook on life, morality, religion, and society, after a long and complex process of exploration, doubt, and contradiction, finally began to mature and fully formed in the 1880s. In his thoughts, he gradually broke away from the aristocratic class and stood on the position of the peasant class. Tolstoy's worldview reflected all the contradictions of peasant thought and peasant psychology during the period of the vigorous development of Russian capitalism and the preparation of the bourgeois democratic revolution. On the one hand, he criticized the Russian political system and the lifestyle and morality of the privileged classes, and finally even negated the state, the church, and the private property system, but at the same time, he adopted a passive attitude towards evil forces, embraced religious fantasies, and preached non-resistance. This kind of thinking is reflected in all of Tolstoy's works after this period.

    In 1889, Tolstoy completed the novel "Resurrection." This is a work that expresses a serious protest against the life foundation of the privileged class in the era of Tsarist Russia.

    In his youth, Tolstoy said that he disliked and tried to avoid satire. He believed that exposure was satire. But in "Resurrection," he raised satire and exposure to the highest degree. While describing the fate of the heroine Katyusha Maslova and her later resurrection, the hero Nekhlyudov's confession and his desire to strive for a new life, he also showed in the novel the impoverished and bankrupt countryside of the Tsarist era, prisons and prisoners, Siberian exile, and revolutionaries. He used the shocking power of exposure to describe the Tsar's courts, churches, high-ranking officials, and even the entire state and social system of Tsarist Russia. While exposing the negative side of the then Russian reality, Tolstoy revealed the inherent festering sores of any capitalist system anywhere. But on the other hand, he preached that personal cultivation, non-violent resistance to evil forces, and loving one's fellow compatriots in accordance with the teachings of the Gospels were the only means to fight against all evil forces (but later Tolstoy himself was excommunicated by the church for writing "Resurrection"). This kind of preaching is obviously incompatible with the content of the whole book.

    In his later years, Tolstoy still worked tirelessly. He wrote many works, the most famous of which are the play "The Living Corpse" (1900) and the novella "Hadji Murat" (1904). In "Hadji Murat," Tolstoy used extraordinary artistic skills to write about an image of a mountain people who loves freedom and is strong and unyielding. The author held a deep sympathy for this character, so that it seemed to contradict his doctrine of non-resistance. Gorky put it well: Tolstoy's work "fundamentally negates his religious philosophy." This is especially true of his later works.

    Tolstoy created many immortal works with extraordinary talent. Only some of the most important ones have been mentioned above. In terms of the depth of shaping character images and the vividness of depicting people's lives, few writers of his time could match Tolstoy. Therefore, Lenin had to say: Tolstoy was good at reaching such a high level of artistic creation that his works occupy a primary position in world literature, and his works should be regarded as a major advance in the artistic development of all mankind. Tolstoy's writings are the common artistic wealth of all mankind, and the writers of New China should absorb infinitely rich artistic nourishment from here.

    纪念俄国伟大作家列夫·托尔斯泰
    俞洁
    今天（九月九日）是俄罗斯的也是世界的最伟大的作家之一列夫·托尔斯泰诞生一百二十五周年纪念日。
    列宁看到，在革命时期的俄国作家中，只有托尔斯泰作品里广泛地深刻地反映了十九世纪末叶和二十世纪初叶俄国历史上最重大的时代——就是那具有世界意义的第一次俄国革命的准备的时代。所以列宁说，托尔斯泰是俄国革命的镜子。这也就是这位天才作家之所以伟大的原因。
    托尔斯泰生于一八二八年，死于一九一○年。他从事文学活动前后将近六十年，在俄国历史上占据了很长一段时间。他诞生的时候，正是一八二五年十二月党人反对专制政体的贵族革命运动，催醒俄国先进分子起来反对农奴制度。在他的童年时代，革命民主主义者别林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜勃罗留波夫的革命思想正在俄国进步阶层里起着支配的作用。托尔斯泰参加过塞瓦斯托波尔的保卫战。而一八五三—一八五六年的克里米亚战争暴露了沙皇政府的腐败和农奴制度的完全破产。一八六一年的所谓农奴“解放”的改革是俄国资本主义猛烈发展的开始。这次改革不但没有改善人民的生活，反而在许多地方使人民陷入了更困苦的境地，因此，同时它又刺激了革命运动的发展。托尔斯泰的晚年是在一九○五年第一次俄国革命时期过去的。这个时期标志着人民在无产阶级领导之下反对资本家和地主的解放运动的新阶段。
    所有这些巨大的历史事件，这个沙皇俄国的腐朽的根基彻底毁坏的过程，都在托尔斯泰一生的思想与创作上留下了深刻的烙印。
    托尔斯泰一生写了很多作品。远在一八五二年，农奴法还没有废除的时候，托尔斯泰就已经开始他的文学事业了。在早期的创作活动里，他写了自传三部曲“童年”、“少年”、“青年”，许多战争小说，其中最著名的是“塞瓦斯托波尔故事”，还有一篇描写农奴与地主的小说“一个地主的早晨”。他的早期的作品一出现，就引起了俄国文学界的注意。车尔尼雪夫斯基非常赏识他的才能，说他是心理分析的能手，而且富有真诚的纯洁的道德感情。
    一八六三年底，托尔斯泰开始动手写作他的长篇巨著“战争与和平”。他以惊人的速度在六年之内完成了这部以一八一二年卫国战争为背景的历史小说。这部小说，从内容的丰富和艺术技巧的高超来说，可以说在全世界文学史上也是罕见的伟大著作。
    我们在“战争与和平”里不但看见了托尔斯泰刻划人物性格的高度技巧和现实主义描写历史事件的巨大力量，而且也看到了作者对于人民力量的信任和他的爱国主义精神。“战争与和平”的真正的主人公是保卫祖国的土地和它的荣誉与自由以抗御暴敌的俄罗斯人民。一八一二年俄国人民反抗拿破仑军队的卫国战争，在“战争与和平”里被描写成人民的、自卫性的、所以也就是正义的战争。在这次战争中起着决定性作用的包罗金诺之战，托尔斯泰首先把它看作俄罗斯人民在道德精神上对敌人的胜利，而法国侵略者的失败乃是追求掠夺目的的法国军队在道德精神上瓦解的结果。这里托尔斯泰还深刻地表现了游击队在这次战争中所起的重大作用。
    在“战争与和平”里，托尔斯泰对于军队统帅的作用和意义的理解是不正确的，他过分减轻了统帅对战争的影响。但是在托尔斯泰之前，还没有一个人能够像他这样正确地理解库图卓夫。他把他描写成了一个真正的、智慧的、人民战争的统帅，给俄国军队以胜利的保证的人民精神的体现者。我们读了“战争与和平”，就会相信，库图卓夫是依靠了布置得非常周密的反攻而击破拿破仑和他的军队的。
    和库图卓夫完全相反，在托尔斯泰笔下的拿破仑是一个刚愎自用的人物，他和自己的人民毫无联系，他认为惟有他自己是毫无过失的。
    小说里的每个正面人物，都有着俄罗斯人民在一八一二年卫国战争中所表现的那种爱国主义感情的力量。他们是把自己的利益与感情去和人民的利益与感情结合在一起的，因此他们在精神上提高了，而且找到了人生的意义。
    在“战争与和平”的艺术形象里吸引我们的不仅仅是人物性格和历史事件的深刻描写，而且是肯定生活的乐观精神。在这部小说里，不但是在俄国军队和俄国人民战胜敌人的描写里，而且在个人私生活的场面里，也都充满着这种愉快的、健康的、肯定生活的精神。
    托尔斯泰的从前的创作所有的一切艺术风格特点，在“战争与和平”里获得了进一步的发展。心理分析的深刻和透彻，用人物的表情、姿态、动作来精确地描写人物，在人物形象、自然景色和战争场面里利用各种典型的细节描写，最后，还有全部小说所固有的高度现实主义艺术，——这一切都在“战争与和平”里表现出托尔斯泰的艺术技巧有了新的长足的进步。
    一八七三年到一八七七年间，托尔斯泰写成了长篇小说“安娜·卡列尼娜”。这是一部在思想深度和文字技巧上可与“战争与和平”媲美的杰作。
    托尔斯泰开始计划写作“安娜·卡列尼娜”的时候，本来只想描写一个有夫之妇的悲惨命运。但是在写作过程中，小说的范围愈推愈广，最后又变成了一部反映整整一个时代的俄国生活的长篇小说了。
    在这部小说里，托尔斯泰答复了当时俄国社会人士所关心的许多问题。如科学和哲学的问题，艺术的问题，历史和政治的问题，政府施政方针的问题，社会问题等等，在小说里多多少少都获得了解答。作为小说构思基础的道德心理的主题，直到包括到了社会的主题里面去之后，才获得了解决。因此，“安娜·卡列尼娜”是一部反映家庭生活的小说，同时也成了一部反映整个社会的小说。
    托尔斯泰以惊人的技巧描写了一个少妇的悲剧。她为了追求真正的幸福，结果在上流社会虚伪而冷酷的压迫之下牺牲了。
    小说描绘出了一幅当时俄国社会各阶层生活的图画，——上自上层贵族阶级起下至农民为止。所有一切人物的命运都和十九世纪七十年代的时代有着密切的关系。
    小说里的人物都想在恋爱方面、家庭方面、社会事业方面创造自己的幸福，但是都失败了。安娜和佛隆斯基的恋爱造成了悲剧。就是列文和凯蒂的恋爱，起初好像很光明很稳固，但是结婚之后，也变得空虚不堪，得不到满足了。列文热烈地、紧张地经营经济事业，他企图参加社会活动，结果和他的恋爱一样，也无法使他解脱心灵上的苦闷。其他的人物如卡列宁、奥勃朗斯基、朵里等等也都是如此。
    在“安娜·卡列尼娜”里，深刻的思想性有机地和惊人的文字艺术技巧结合在一起。从人物及其内心的体验、苦闷、激动、顾虑、精神上的追求和动摇等等的描写的力量和技巧说来，这部小说是不下于“战争与和平”的。
    在十九世纪的七十年代，在完成“安娜·卡列尼娜”的前后，托尔斯泰的人生观、道德观、宗教观和社会观，在经过了长时期的摸索、怀疑、矛盾的复杂过程之后，终于开始成熟，而于八十年代完全形成。他在思想上渐渐脱离贵族阶级，而站到农民阶级的立场上去。在托尔斯泰的世界观里，反映出了俄国资本主义猛烈发展和资产阶级民主革命准备时期农民思想和农民心理的全部矛盾。他一面抨击俄国的政治制度和特权阶级的生活方式与道德，最后并且否定国家、教会和私有财产制度，但是同时他又对恶势力采取消极的态度，抱着宗教的幻想，作着不抵抗的说教。这种思想表现在这个时期以后的托尔斯泰的一切作品里面。
    一八八九年，托尔斯泰完成了长篇小说“复活”。这是一部对沙俄时代特权阶级的生活基础表示严重抗议的作品。
    在青年时代，托尔斯泰说他是不喜欢而且竭力避免讽刺的。他认为暴露就是讽刺。但是在“复活”里他却把讽刺和暴露提到了最高度。他一面描写女主人公卡秋莎·马斯洛娃的命运和她后来的复活，男主人公涅赫留道夫的忏悔和他努力追求新生活的渴望，同时他在小说里表现了沙俄时代的贫困破产的农村，牢狱和囚徒，西伯利亚的流放和革命家。他以惊心动魄的暴露力量来描写沙皇的法院、教会、大官僚直至沙皇俄国的全部国家和社会制度。在暴露当时俄国现实的否定面的时候，托尔斯泰揭发了任何地方一切资本主义制度所固有的脓疮。但是另一方面他却又宣传着这样的说教，他说个人的修身、不用暴力抵抗恶势力、遵照福音书的教义去爱自己的同胞等等，乃是和一切恶势力斗争的唯一手段（但是后来托尔斯泰自己却因为写了“复活”而被教会驱逐出教）。这种说教显然和全书的内容是格格不入的。
    晚年时代，托尔斯泰还是孜孜不倦地工作。他写了不少作品，其中最著名的有剧本“活尸”（一九○○年）和中篇小说“哈吉·摩拉”（一九○四年）。在“哈吉·摩拉”里，托尔斯泰以非凡的艺术技巧写出了一个酷爱自由、坚强不屈的山民的形象。作者对这个人物抱着深切的同情，以致显得和他的不抵抗学说自相矛盾了。高尔基说得好：托尔斯泰的作品是“根本否定他的宗教哲学的”。晚年的作品尤其如此。
    托尔斯泰以非凡的才力创作了许多不朽的作品，上面只举了其中最重要的一些。就塑造人物形象的深刻和描写人民生活的生动来说，在同时代的作家中，是很少有人能和托尔斯泰相匹敌的。所以列宁要说：托尔斯泰善于达到这样高的艺术创造的高度，以致他的作品在全世界文学中占有了一个首要的地位，他的作品应当看作是全人类艺术发展中的一大进步。托尔斯泰的著作是全人类共有的艺术财富，新中国的作家应该从这里吸收无限丰富的艺术养分。
