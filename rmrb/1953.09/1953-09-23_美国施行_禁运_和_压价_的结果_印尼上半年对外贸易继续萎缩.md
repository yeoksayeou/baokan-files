Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 22nd: As a result of the United States' implementation of "embargo" and "price suppression" policies, the prices of Indonesian raw material exports have plummeted, affecting the continued contraction of Indonesia's foreign trade in the first half of this year.

According to figures recently released by the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics, the total export trade from January to June this year (excluding kerosene transactions where foreign companies handle their own foreign exchange) amounted to 3,333,600,000 Indonesian Rupiahs, a decrease of 1,180,000,000 Indonesian Rupiahs compared to the same period in 1952. The export trade in 1952 had already decreased by 22 percent compared to 1951.

Indonesia's imports from January to June this year totaled 3,811,600,000 Indonesian Rupiahs, a decrease of 853,000,000 Indonesian Rupiahs compared to the same period last year. The decrease in Indonesia's imports is mainly because the Indonesian government, in order to cope with the difficult situation of insufficient foreign exchange income caused by the sharp drop in raw material export prices, has implemented strict import restrictions. Even so, under the influence of the United States' plundering policy, Indonesia's international trade balance cannot avoid a deficit. The foreign trade deficit for the first half of this year reached 478 million Indonesian Rupiahs, more than tripling the deficit of 150,090,000 Indonesian Rupiahs in the first half of 1952.

    印尼上半年对外贸易继续萎缩
    【新华社二十二日讯】雅加达消息：美国施行“禁运”和“压价”政策的结果，使印度尼西亚出口原料的价格惨跌，影响印尼今年上半年的对外贸易继续萎缩。
    据印尼中央统计局最近公布的数字，今年一月到六月的出口贸易（外汇归外资公司自己处理的煤油买卖除外）合计为印尼币三十三亿三千三百六十万盾，比一九五二年同期间的出口贸易减少了十一亿八千万盾，而一九五二年的出口贸易已比一九五一年减少了百分之二十二。
    印尼今年一月到六月的入口共为三十八亿一千一百六十万盾，比去年同期间的入口减少了八亿五千三百万盾。印尼入口的减少，主要是因为印尼政府为了应付由于出口原料价格惨跌而引起的外汇收入不敷支出的困难处境，实行了严格的入口限制。虽然如此，在美国掠夺政策的影响下，印尼的国际贸易收支还不能免于发生逆差。今年上半年的对外贸易逆差数字达到四亿七千八百万盾，比一九五二年上半年的逆差数字一亿五千零九十万盾增加到三倍多。
