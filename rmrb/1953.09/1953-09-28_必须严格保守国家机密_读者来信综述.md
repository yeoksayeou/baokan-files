Reader Letters Summary:

    Must Strictly Guard State Secrets
    — A Summary of Readers' Letters
    Since the Central People's Government Administration Council issued the "Instructions on Government Workers at All Levels Guarding State Secrets" and the "Provisional Regulations on Guarding State Secrets," all agencies and units across the country have earnestly studied them, established confidentiality organizations and systems, and generally speaking, have attached importance to confidentiality work. However, judging from the facts revealed in the readers' letters recently received by this newspaper, some agencies and cadres still do not pay enough attention to confidentiality work.
    Reader Li Yuxing wrote to reflect that the former Kaiping Coal Mine General Military Representative Office collected a batch of valuable data in 1950. When the Ministry of Fuel Industry needed it recently, this batch of data could not be found. After writing letters separately to the original handlers who had been transferred to work elsewhere to return for investigation, some of them were finally found in a pile of messy papers in a small room near the mine's Party committee office, but two-thirds of them had already been lost. Readers Fei Shaojie and others from Beijing wrote to reflect that the paper used by a sesame seed cake shop near them to wrap sesame seed cakes were all letters of introduction (all stamped with official seals) from various agencies to the Beijing Grain Company for purchasing grain. The readers have collected dozens of them. Lü Xianbian from the East China Textile Industry Institute wrote to say that many students in their school were copying materials about China's newly built textile factories. After investigation, it was learned that these materials were copied by a student from Mr. Cheng Xiwen of the Central South Textile College (now the Vice President of Wuhan Textile Industry School). When they were copying the materials, they all told each other to "keep it secret," but as a result, it spread wider and wider.
    The above-mentioned situation of neglecting confidentiality is absolutely not allowed to continue to exist. It should be recognized that the greater the achievements of our national construction, the more the enemy will hate us and try every means to carry out sabotage activities. When the country is carrying out planned economic construction, if we are negligent and relax our vigilance, the enemy may take advantage of our loopholes and carry out sabotage activities. Therefore, this issue must arouse our constant and high degree of attention.
    In order to correct the bad phenomenon of neglecting to guard state secrets, leading organs at all levels should first strengthen confidentiality education, so that cadres can always maintain revolutionary vigilance and develop a good habit of guarding state secrets. Secondly, confidentiality organizations and confidentiality systems should be established and improved, the scope of confidentiality should be defined, and the implementation should be checked regularly. Finally, necessary reward and punishment measures should also be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the "Provisional Regulations on Guarding State Secrets": personnel who consistently abide by the confidentiality system and can promote others to guard secrets should be commended and rewarded; personnel who disclose state secrets should also be given criticism or even disciplinary action according to the different nature and circumstances of the case.

### 必须严格保守国家机密——读者来信综述

专栏：读者来信摘要

    必须严格保守国家机密
    ——读者来信综述
    自从中央人民政府政务院发布了“关于各级政府工作人员保守国家机密的指示”和“保守国家机密暂行条例”后，全国各机关单位经过认真的学习，建立了保密组织和制度，对保密工作一般说是重视了。但是，从本报最近接到读者来信所揭发的事实来看，有一些机关和干部对保密工作还是不够重视的。
    读者李浴星来信反映：前开滦煤矿总军事代表办事处曾于一九五○年搜集了一批很有价值的资料。最近中央燃料工业部需用时，这批资料却找不到了。经分别写信请现已调到别处工作的原经手人回来清查，最后才在该矿党委办公室附近一间小屋内的乱纸堆中找到了一些，但其中有三分之二已经丢失了。北京市读者费绍杰等来信反映：他们附近一家烧饼铺用来包烧饼的纸都是各机关向北京市粮食公司购买粮食的介绍信（上面都盖着公章），仅读者收留起来的就有数十张。华东纺织工业学院吕先鞭来信说：他们学校里不少同学都在传抄关于我国新建纺织厂的一些材料。经了解，这些材料是一位同学从中南纺织专科学校成希文先生（现任武汉纺织工业学校副校长）那里抄来的。他们在传抄材料时都相告要“保密”，但结果却越传越广。
    上述忽视保密情况是绝对不容再继续存在的。应该认识：我们国家建设的成就越大，敌人就越发对我们仇视，并千方百计地企图进行破坏活动。在国家进行有计划经济建设的时候，如果我们麻痹大意，放松警惕，就可能被敌人钻了空子，进行破坏活动。因此，这个问题必须引起我们经常的、高度的重视。
    为了纠正忽视保守国家机密的不良现象，各级领导机关首先应该加强保密教育，使干部经常保持革命警惕，养成保守国家机密的优良习惯。其次，应该建立和健全保密组织和保密制度，划定保密范围，并经常检查执行情况。最后，还应该根据“保守国家机密暂行条例”的规定，实行必要的奖惩办法：对一贯遵守保密制度并能推动他人保守机密的人员应给以表扬和奖励；对于泄露国家机密的人员亦应根据不同性质和情节，给以批评以至纪律处分。
