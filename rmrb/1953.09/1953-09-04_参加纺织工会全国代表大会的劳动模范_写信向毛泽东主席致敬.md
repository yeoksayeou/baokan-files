    [This Newspaper] News: Hao Jianxiu, Wang Deshan, Hang Peilan and other one hundred and six industrial labor models, and Hao Jianxiu Group, the spinning workshop of the State-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and other twenty-four model units attending the Second National Congress of the Textile Workers' Union of China, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao Zedong on August 10 to pay their respects. The letter said: We are here to attend the Second National Congress of the Textile Workers' Union of China. We have not only learned advanced experiences from various places, but also received honors and material rewards from the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, which makes us feel extremely honored and excited. Each of us clearly knows that this glory is given to us by you and the Communist Party of China. It is thanks to your and the Communist Party's wise leadership that we have truly turned ourselves over and become masters of the country; thanks to your and the Party's training and education, we have learned to use our brains, improve our work methods, improve our tools, and produce more textiles, creating wealth for the country.
    Chairman Mao! Under your and the Communist Party of China's leadership, our textile workers have fully developed their enthusiasm for production, actively learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and created and promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the 1951 Weaving Work Method, the 1953 Textile Machine Maintenance Work Method and other advanced experiences, so that China's textile production has exceeded the highest record in China's textile history. As production has increased, our material and cultural lives have also improved.
    You taught us that we must transform our country from an agricultural country into an industrial country, because "without industry, there will be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." We assure you that we will follow your instructions, unite and lead all textile workers, technicians, and management personnel, further develop the labor emulation campaign, insist on promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method, vigorously promote the 1953 Textile Machine Maintenance Work Method and other advanced experiences, fully utilize machine efficiency, continue to reduce the yarn breakage rate, produce more new and high-quality textiles at low prices to meet the needs of the people of the whole country, accumulate funds for the country's development of heavy industry, and strive to realize national industrialization and gradually transition to a socialist society.
    You taught us that labor models should be leaders of the masses, the core backbone of the masses, and a bridge between the leadership and the masses. We assure you that we will firmly remember your instructions and will never be arrogant, complacent, or conservative after we return. We must, under the Party's training and education, learn more modestly from the masses, learn politics, learn culture, learn management knowledge, learn advanced experience, especially learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and constantly improve our awareness and cultural and technical level. We will use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to consolidate our achievements, overcome our shortcomings, and fully exert our leading role, backbone role, and bridge role, and contribute all our strength to building a great motherland. We know that there will be difficulties in our work, but under your and the Party's education, we have full confidence and determination to overcome all kinds of difficulties and complete our glorious tasks.
    Respected Chairman Mao, we respectfully wish you boundless longevity!

    毛主席！在您和中国共产党的领导下，我们纺织工人充分地发挥了生产积极性，积极学习苏联先进经验，创造和推广了郝建秀工作法、一九五一织布工作法、一九五三纺织机器保全工作法和其他先进经验，使我国纺织生产超过了我国纺织史上的最高纪录。随着生产的提高，我们的物质生活和文化生活也改善了。
    您教导我们说，要把我们的国家从农业国变成工业国，因为“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”我们向您保证：一定要遵从您的指示，团结和带动全体纺织工人和技术人员、管理人员，进一步开展劳动竞赛，坚持推行郝建秀工作法、一九五一织布工作法，大力推广一九五三纺织机器保全工作法和其他先进经验，充分发挥机器效率，继续降低断头率，生产更多花样翻新、物美价廉的纺织品，满足全国人民的需要，为国家发展重工业积累资金，为实现国家工业化与逐步过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。
    您教导我们说，劳动模范要作群众的带头人，作群众的核心骨干，作领导和群众之间的桥梁。我们向您保证：要牢牢记住您的指示，回去以后决不骄傲，不自满，不保守，一定要在党的培养教育下，更虚心地向群众学习，学习政治，学习文化，学习管理知识，学习先进经验，特别是学习苏联的先进经验，不断提高自己的觉悟程度和文化、技术水平，用批评和自我批评的武器，巩固成绩，克服缺点，充分发挥带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，把自己的力量全部贡献出来，建设伟大的祖国。我们知道，在工作中是会有困难的，但是在您和党的教育下，我们有充分的信心和决心，能战胜各种困难，完成自己光荣的任务。
    敬爱的毛主席，敬祝您万寿无疆！
