    Several Methods to Prevent Winter Wheat from Missing Seedlings and Broken Ridges
    Letters from Wei Hongjun of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute and Zhao Jianqiu of the Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Yishi County, Shanxi Province: Now is the time for sowing winter wheat, and how to ensure full ridges and full seedlings is a very important issue. According to the situation in North China over the years, rough tillage, poor sowing techniques, and damage from underground pests (mole crickets, wireworms) are the main causes of missing seedlings and broken ridges. Therefore, to eliminate the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges, the following points must be noted:

    I. Implement early plowing, deep plowing, shallow harrowing, and fine raking. Pay special attention to breaking up the clods of soil on the edges of the fields, at the ends of the fields, and in waterlogged areas. Prepare the land carefully and evenly. In addition, select good seeds and sow them at the appropriate time.

    II. Master the technique of using a seed drill, and pay attention to the size of the seed holes. Generally, three fingers should be used to align the ridge, with the middle finger bent over and inserted into the seed hole. The hand should be kept level with the ridge, and the steps should be small. When there are more seeds in the hopper, the pace should be faster; when there are fewer seeds, the pace should be slower, so that the seeds are sown evenly. Sowing should be faster on downhill slopes and slower on uphill slopes. When starting the drill, shake it tightly three times; when stopping the drill, do not shake it for the three steps before stopping. If the drill is stopped and restarted midway, the livestock can be backed up slightly and the drill shaken tightly once or twice.

    III. Prevent damage from mole crickets and wireworms. Use 3.2 mace of 6% "666" powder and mix it with 10 jin of half-cooked millet, then dry it until it is 70% dry. Mix it with the wheat seeds when sowing (3-4 jin per mu) to prevent mole crickets and wireworms. In addition, grind 4 liang of red alum into a fine powder, cook 2-3 jin of millet until half-cooked, then take it out, mix it with the medicine, and dry it until it is 70% dry. Mix it with the wheat seeds when sowing to avoid damage from mole crickets. However, be especially careful when using these medicines: the amount of medicine should not be increased or decreased at will; wear a mask when mixing, wash your hands immediately after mixing, and sow immediately to avoid poisoning people and animals.

    防止冬小麦缺苗断垅现象的几项办法
    华北农业科学研究所魏鸿钧、山西省猗氏县农业技术推广站赵剑秋来信：现在正是冬小麦播种时期，如何保证全垅全苗是个很重要的问题。根据华北历年情况来看，整地粗糙、摇耧技术不好、地下害虫（蝼蛄、金针虫）为害是缺苗断垅的主要原因。因此，要消灭缺苗断垅现象，必须注意以下几点：
    一、要实行早耕、深耕、浅犁、细耙，特别要注意把地边、地头、积水洼地的土块打碎，把地整理得精细平坦；此外，还要选好种籽，适时下种。
    二、掌握摇耧技术，注意籽眼大小。通常以三个指头并垅以中指翘在上面、伸进籽眼为宜，手要扶平垅，脚步跳小些。当耧斗种籽多时宜快些，少时宜慢些，使先后下籽均匀。下坡地要摇快些，上坡时宜慢些。起耧时紧摇三下，停耧前三步不摇；如中途停耧另起时，可令牲口稍退紧摇一二下。
    三、防止蝼蛄、金针虫为害。用百分之六的“六六六”粉剂三两二钱，与煮成半熟的谷子十斤拌匀，晒到七成干后，播种时与麦籽一同下种（每亩用三斤至四斤），可防治蝼蛄和金针虫。此外，用红矾四两研成细末，用二、三斤小米煮成半熟后捞出，将药拌上，晒到七成干，混合麦籽一同下种，也可避免蝼蛄为害。但在用这些药剂时要特别小心：药量不可随意增减；拌时要带口罩，拌毕即刻洗手，即刻下种，以免人畜中毒。
