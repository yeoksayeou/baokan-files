Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Soviet working people warmly support the resolutions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) on measures to further develop Soviet agriculture. They firmly express their determination to struggle for the thorough implementation of this resolution.

The members of the Khrushchev Collective Farm in the Brovary District of the Kiev Oblast in the Ukrainian Republic rushed to the farm management department to exchange views after hearing the broadcast about the resolution. The chairman of the collective farm, Kovbasyinsky, said: Our collective farm's cash income last year was 2,553,000 rubles, and this year it has increased by another 1 million rubles. The recent resolutions passed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have opened up new possibilities for us to further develop the collective farm's public economy and improve the welfare of the collective farmers. During the conversation, all the farm members focused on how to tap production potential to better implement the Party's resolutions. Livestock feeder Shikula pointed out: Some advanced milkmaids can milk 2,400 to 2,500 liters from each cow, while others average only 1,500 liters. He said that the Party's instructions must be implemented to increase the output of the farm's public livestock industry. Field team leader Babicha said: Due to improved farming techniques, the farm's harvest of grain, potatoes, and vegetables has doubled, but some advanced farmers have harvested 2,300 to 2,600 kilograms of wheat from each hectare of land, far exceeding the farm's average harvest. Therefore, if the experience of advanced workers is popularized, the collective farm can harvest tens of thousands of kilograms more of grain.

Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms in Kuban are holding symposiums to discuss the CPSU Central Committee's resolution. Kalugin, the field team leader of the "Beacon of Revolution" Collective Farm in the Kurgan Oblast, said: This document adopted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union fully reflects our wishes and thoughts. We will do our best to develop all sectors of the collective farm's public economy and strive to produce abundant agricultural and livestock products in the coming years.

Soviet industrial workers also warmly support the CPSU Central Committee's resolution. Workers everywhere know that the high tide of socialist industry is the foundation for further developing agriculture. They are determined to produce more and better machines to support the development of agriculture. Vilykanov, the foreman of the mechanical workshop of the Sverdlovsk Transport and Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, said: Further developing agriculture is a matter of vital interest to all Soviet people. All the workers in our workshop are manufacturing parts for agricultural machines, and we guarantee to provide agriculture with more good parts. Kovalenko, a forger at the Ural Machine Factory, said: The Party has always taught us that without the development of heavy industry, we cannot guarantee the growth of agriculture, and we cannot guarantee the improvement of the production of people's daily necessities. Therefore, each of us must work better and more efficiently. This is our contribution to further improving agriculture.

    苏联人民热烈拥护苏共中央决议 
    坚决表示为进一步发展苏联农业而努力
    据新华社讯：苏联劳动人民热烈拥护苏联共产党中央委员会关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施的决议。他们坚决表示要为彻底实现这个决议而斗争。
    乌克兰共和国基辅州布罗瓦尔区赫鲁晓夫集体农庄的庄员们，在听到了关于这个决议的广播后，纷纷赶到农庄管理部去交换意见。集体农庄主席科夫巴辛斯基说：我们这个集体农庄去年收入现金二百五十五万三千卢布，今年又增加了一百万卢布。苏联共产党中央委员会最近通过的决议，为我们开辟了进一步发展集体农庄公有经济和增进集体农民福利的新的可能性。在交谈中，全庄庄员都注意到了如何发掘生产潜力以更好地实现党的决议的问题。饲畜员希库拉指出：有的先进挤奶妇从每头母牛身上可挤奶二千四、五百公升，而其他人平均只挤奶一千五百公升。他说，必须执行党的指示来提高农庄公有饲畜业的产量。田间工作队队长巴比查说：由于改进耕作技术，农庄的谷物、马铃薯、蔬菜的收获量提高了一倍，可是有的先进农民从每公顷田地上收获了二千三百到二千六百公斤小麦，大大超过全农庄的平均收获量。因此，如果普及先进者的经验，集体农庄还可以多收几十万公斤谷物。
    库班的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场都举行座谈会，讨论苏共中央的决议。库尔干区“革命灯塔”集体农庄田间工作队队长卡卢金说：苏联共产党中央委员会通过的这个文件，充分反映了我们的愿望和思想。我们将尽力发展集体农庄公有经济的一切部门，争取在最近几年内生产丰富的农产品和畜产品。
    苏联产业工人也热烈拥护苏共中央的决议。各地的工人知道，社会主义工业的高涨是进一步发展农业的基础。他们决定要生产更多、更好的机器来支援农业的发展。斯维德洛夫斯克运输和重型机器制造厂机械车间领班维利卡诺夫说：进一步发展农业，这是关系全体苏联人民切身利益的事情。我们车间全体工人是制造农业机器的机件的，我们保证要给农业更多的好机件。乌拉尔机器工厂锻工科瓦连科说：党经常教导我们：不发展重工业就不能保证农业的增长，就不能保证人民的日用必需品生产的提高。因此，我们每个人必须更好地、更有效率地工作。这就是我们对于进一步提高农业的贡献。
