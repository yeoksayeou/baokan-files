A Glimpse of Machines in the Square

On the inner and outer squares in front of the main hall of the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, hundreds of various machines are displayed, including cranes, locomotives, various lathes, coal mining machines, pulp machines, trucks, agricultural machines, and sugar-making machines. Many machines, with their towering stature and ingenious structure, attract people's attention. The two cranes, visible from outside the Cultural Palace wall, have been familiar to Beijing residents since before the exhibition opened. The one painted in the colors of the Polish flag—red and white—is a double-arm crane, 45.8 meters high and weighing 32 tons, capable of lifting 15 tons of cargo. It is one of the most important tools in port loading and unloading operations. The other, a tower crane painted yellow that can move freely on steel rails, is a capable assistant to construction workers, able to flexibly lift 3 tons of construction materials to a height of more than 30 meters. Both of these tall cranes can rotate 360 degrees. They can do the work of hundreds of people but require only two people to operate.

The heaviest exhibit is the 66-ton double-column vertical lathe, which occupies only about two square meters. On its rotating table, it can place workpieces weighing 25 tons and with a diameter of 3,600 millimeters. The entire machine is powered by seven motors and requires only one person to operate. Visitors will see that this lathe can cut hard steel materials as easily and conveniently as we peel fruit with a knife.

In the western half of the square, a series of coal mining machines are displayed. There are mobile coal cutters, coal conveyors capable of transporting 120 tons of coal per hour, automatic coal loaders, and automatic conveyor belts. They show the audience the entire mechanized coal mining process from extraction to loading and transportation. These machines simplify and replace the most arduous and laborious mining work and greatly improve the efficiency of coal mining.

All these machines of different styles and sizes embody the hard work and wisdom of Polish workers and demonstrate the rapid development of one of the most important sectors of the Polish national economy—the machinery manufacturing industry.

"Polish Speed"

After the Second World War, a saying circulated in Europe to express the rapid progress of work: "Polish Speed." This was created by people admiring the extraordinary perseverance and astonishing speed shown by the Polish people in rebuilding Warsaw and constructing their motherland. Every visitor will gain a very clear understanding of the profound meaning of this saying after seeing this economic exhibition. Many explanatory texts and figures in the exhibition show that the Polish people are increasing the production of various industrial products not by a few percent, nor by tens of percent, but by hundreds of percent. Today's records negate yesterday's, and new achievements are repeatedly replaced by newer ones.

Coal is Poland's most important national wealth, and the Polish people affectionately call it "black diamond." Behind a pile of silver-plated coal picks, coal samples, and miners' lamps, we can see some pictures and figures marking the rapid development of the Polish coal mining industry. New electric picks have replaced the original coal mining tool, the pickaxe. Dozens of coal mining combines from the Soviet Union are working in Polish mines. In another two years, half of Poland's coal mines will use Polish-made combines. Poland's coal production before the war was more than 38 million tons, reached more than 84 million tons last year, and will increase to 100 million tons by 1955. Calculated per capita, Poland's coal production now exceeds that of the United States. Today, Poland can not only fully meet its own coal needs but also supply it in large quantities to fraternal countries and export it to some capitalist countries.

Steel is the foundation of industry. The development of steel production in Poland is also astonishing. The "Nowa Huta" metallurgical plant is the pride of the Polish people. Its situation is being circulated like a myth. In a corner of the hall, we can see a photo full of steel frames, which is the construction situation of a workshop in this factory. This largest project in Poland's Six-Year Plan has now begun partial production. When it is fully completed, its annual output will reach 1.5 million tons, exceeding the total steel output of Poland before the war. On display at the exhibition are many steel pipes, steel rails, and wheels made from steel produced by this factory and other steel mills.

A country's backwardness or advancement can be seen from its electricity production. In terms of electrification, Poland, in a short period, has also changed from one of the most backward countries in Europe to one of the most advanced. In the northeast corner of the hall, various generators, magnetic insulators for power stations, telephones, coils, and light bulbs and other electrical appliances are displayed. The explanatory text tells us that during the Six-Year Plan period (1950-1955), 9,000 villages in Poland will be electrified. If this were during the era of bourgeois rule, it would take 150 years to complete. During the Six-Year Plan period, Poland will build 76,000 kilometers of transmission and branch lines, which is equal to thirteen times the distance from Moscow to Beijing.

Polish comrades at the exhibition said that our entire country is a huge construction site. This is not false at all. From the Baltic coast to the Vistula River, from the Silesian mining area to the suburbs of Warsaw, construction is underway everywhere. At the exhibition, we can not only see photos of Warsaw's Constitution Square and grand buildings built from ruins, but also the granite, cement, and hollow bricks that make up these magnificent buildings. Poland's current construction volume has increased tenfold compared to before the war, with one industrial enterprise being completed and put into operation and 400 modern houses being completed every day. During the entire Six-Year Plan period, more than 750,000 houses will be built, housing 2.5 million residents. This figure is equal to one-tenth of the country's population. To meet such large-scale needs, Poland's construction industry is developing rapidly, now producing 3.5 million tons of cement and 4 billion bricks annually.

Examples of a Happy Life

Many exhibits show the audience the abundance and happiness of the Polish people's lives today. People will be very interested in the light industry hall. It is divided into several sections: food, leather products, fashion, household goods, and paper and toys. Due to their rich content and beautiful displays, if they were moved to the side of the street, each section could stand alone as a very beautiful storefront. There are various exquisite foods: chocolate, biscuits, candies, canned goods, wines, and sugar; there are suitcases, leather briefcases, leather shoes, sneakers, and various balls; there are also various colorful wool and silk fabrics, exquisitely crafted glassware, and lovely and comfortable furniture. The consumption of meat and woolen fabrics by Polish residents has doubled compared to before the war. By 1955, every person in the country will receive a pair of leather shoes each year. These figures tell us that everything displayed here is already a necessity enjoyed by the Polish people in their daily lives.

At the eastern end of the light industry hall, a space has been specially set aside, and cabinets, bookshelves, tea tables, chairs, and radio receivers are arranged in an orderly manner. This is not a store window, but a corner of an ordinary Polish worker's home. Comrade Bierut said: "It is our sacred responsibility to arrange a simple and comfortable home for people, to create a more fulfilling life, and a happier future." This sentence has gradually become the real life of the Polish people.

The contrast between the happiness of the Polish people today and the suffering before liberation is as obvious as day and night. In the eastern part of the hall, there are a few inconspicuous exhibits that reflect the miserable situation of old Poland under the rule of landlords and the bourgeoisie. In a photo, we see a farmer with a sad face accompanied by three ragged children. Behind them is a dilapidated shack with a collapsing chimney, only one person high, probably their only shelter. Under the photo, there is a primitive farming tool—a wooden rake. Before liberation, Polish farmers relied on these ancient tools to produce meager grains, barely maintaining their lives. But in Poland today, new farmhouses have been built, power lines have been erected in the countryside, and primitive farm tools have been replaced by tractors and new farm tools.

The brilliant achievements of the Polish people shown in the Economic Exhibition of the People's Republic of Poland will make the audience in our country feel particularly close and excited. The holding of this exhibition will undoubtedly further enhance the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and Poland and promote the exchange of cultural and scientific and technological knowledge between the two countries.

    波兰人民的光辉成就
    ——记波兰人民共和国经济展览会
    陈有为
    广场机器一瞥
    在北京市劳动人民文化宫大殿前的内外广场上，陈列着数百件各种各样的机器，其中包括起重机、火车头、各式车床、采煤机、纸浆机、载重卡车、农业机器和制糖机等等。许多机器以它高大的身材和精巧的结构吸引着人们的注意。从文化宫墙外就可望见的两架起重机，早在展览会开幕以前就为北京的居民所熟悉了。那架涂漆着波兰国旗的颜色——红白两色的，是双臂起重机，高四十五点八公尺，重三十二吨，能起十五吨重的货物。它是港口运卸工作中的一个最重要的工具。另一架可以在钢轨上运走自如、混身漆着黄色的塔形起重机，是建筑工人的得力助手，它能把三吨重的建筑器材灵活地吊送到三十多公尺的高空。这两架高大的起重机，都可以作三百六十度的转动。它们可以做数百人的工作，却只须两个人来操纵。
    最重的展品是六十六吨的双柱立式车床，只占二平方公尺左右的地方，在它的圆台上，可以放置重二十五吨、直径三千六百公厘的工作物。整个机器由七个马达来发动运转，而只须一个人来操纵。人们在参观时将会看到，这架车床在切削坚硬的钢铁材料时，就像我们用小刀削果皮一样地轻易方便。
    在广场的西半部，陈放着一系列的采煤机器。有移动式割煤机、每小时能运煤一百二十吨的运煤机、自动装煤车和自动传送带等。它们向观众显示了从开采到装运的整个机械化采煤过程。这些机器简化了和代替了最繁重辛劳的采矿工作，并大大地提高采煤工作的效率。
    所有这些不同式样和不同大小的机器，都凝聚着波兰工人的辛勤劳动和智慧，表明了波兰国民经济的一个最重要的部门——机器制造业的迅速发展。
    “波兰速度”
    第二次世界大战以后，在欧洲曾经流行过这样一句话，以表示工作进展的迅速：“波兰的速度”。这是人们钦佩波兰人民复兴华沙和建设祖国时所表现的非凡毅力与惊人速度而创造出来的。对于这句话的深刻意义，每一个观众看了这次经济展览会后，都将获得十分明确的了解。展览会里的许多说明文和数字，都显示了波兰人民不是百分之几，也不是百分之几十，而是百分之几百地增加着各种工业品的产量。今天的纪录否定了昨天的，而新的成就又一再地被更新的所代替。
    煤是波兰最主要的国家财富，波兰人民亲切地把它叫做“黑钻石”。在一堆镀着银色的掘煤风镐、煤块样品和矿灯的后边，我们可以看到一些标志着波兰采煤工业飞速发展的图片和数字。新式的电动风镐代替了原始的掘煤工具鹤嘴锄。来自苏联的几十架采煤康拜因，正在波兰矿井中工作。再过二年以后，波兰一半的煤矿，就将采用波兰自制的康拜因机了。波兰煤的产量在战前是三千八百多万吨，去年已达八千四百多万吨，而到一九五五年将增加到一亿吨。如按人口平均计算，波兰煤的产量现在已经超过美国了。今天波兰不仅能够充分满足本国用煤，而且还大量地供应给各兄弟国家，并向一些资本主义国家输出。
    钢铁是工业的基础。波兰钢铁生产的发展也是惊人的。“诺瓦·胡塔”冶金工厂是波兰人民的骄傲。关于它的情形，被人们像神话一样地传诵着。我们在大厅的一角可以看到一幅钢架密布的照片，那是这个工厂一个车间的建筑情形。这个波兰六年计划中最大的工程，现在已经开始部分地进行生产了。到全部完工时，它的年产量将达到一百五十万吨，超过战前波兰全国的钢产量。在展览会上，陈列着许多用这个工厂和其他钢厂所生产的钢来制造的钢管、钢轨和车轮。
    一个国家的落后或先进，可以从它的电力生产的情形看出来。在电气化的事业方面，波兰在短短的几年内，也已经从欧洲最落后的国家之一变成为最先进的国家之一了。在大殿的东北角，陈设着各种发电机、发电站用的磁绝缘器、电话、线圈以及灯泡等电气用品。说明文字告诉我们：在六年计划期内（一九五○——一九五五年）波兰将有九千个农村实行电气化。如果在资产阶级统治时代，这需要一百五十年的时间才能完成。在六年计划期间内，波兰全国要架设长达七万六千公里的输电线和支线，这个长度等于从莫斯科到北京的距离的十三倍。
    展览会上的波兰工作同志说，我们整个的国家就是一个巨大的建筑工地。这是一点也不假的。从波罗的海沿岸到维斯杜拉河畔，从西里西亚矿区到华沙市郊，到处都在大兴土木。在展览会上，我们不仅可以看到从废墟中建立起来的华沙宪法广场和宏伟大厦的照片，而且还可以看到构成这些瑰丽建筑物的花岗石、水泥和空心砖。波兰今天的建筑工程量比战前增加了十倍，每天就有一个工业企业交工和四百间现代住房落成。在整个六年计划期间，要盖起住房七十五万多间，供二百五十万居民住用。这个数字等于全国人口的十分之一。为了适应这样大规模的需要，波兰的建筑工业正在迅速发展，现在每年出产水泥三百五十万吨和砖四十亿块。
    幸福生活的例证
    不少的展品向观众们显示了今天波兰人民生活的富足和幸福情况。人们对于轻工业馆将会感到很大的兴趣。这里分设着食品、皮革制品、时装、家庭用品和纸张、玩具等几个部分。由于它们内容的丰富和陈设的美观，如果把它们移到街道旁边，每一个部分都可以单独作为一个十分漂亮的店面。这里有各种精美食品：巧克力、饼干、糖果、罐头、酒类和砂糖；有皮箱、皮箧、皮鞋、球鞋及各种球类；也有各种五光十色的呢绒绸缎，有制作精巧的玻璃器皿，也有令人喜爱的舒适家具。波兰居民的肉类和毛织品的消费量已比战前增加了一倍。到一九五五年时，全国每人每年将得到一双皮鞋。这些数字告诉我们：在这里陈列的一切，已是波兰人民在日常生活中所享用到的必需品了。
    在轻工业馆的东头，特地辟出了一块地方，井井有条地陈设着柜子、书架、茶桌、椅子和无线电收音机等。这不是商店的橱窗，而是一个波兰普通工人家庭的一角。贝鲁特同志说过：“替人们安排一个简单舒适的家庭，创造一个更美满的生活，更幸福的前途，这是我们神圣的责任。”这句话已经逐渐变成波兰人民的现实生活了。
    波兰人民今天的幸福和解放前的痛苦的对比，就像白天跟黑夜那样的明显。在大殿的东部，有几件不甚引人注目的展品，反映了旧波兰在地主——资产阶级统治之下的悲惨景象。在一幅照片上，我们看到一个满脸愁容的农民伴着三个衣衫褴褛的小孩，在他们后边的是一所烟囱倾倒、高仅一人的破棚户，大概就是他们唯一的栖身之所了。在照片的底下，有一架原始的农具——木耙，解放前的波兰农民，就靠着这些古老的工具生产出微少的谷物，勉强维持生活。但是今天的波兰，新式的农舍已经建立起来，在农村中架设了电线，原始的农具已经被拖拉机和新式农具所代替了。
    波兰人民共和国经济展览会所显示出来的波兰人民的辉煌成就，将使我国观众感到特别亲切和兴奋。这个展览会的举行，无疑将进一步增进中波两国人民的友谊合作，促进两国文化和科学技术知识的交流。
