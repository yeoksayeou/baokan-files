Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Materials published in the American bourgeois press show that in the process of intensifying the militarization of the national economy, the profits of American monopoly capital have increased unabatedly, while the actual income of the American people has continuously decreased.

According to a survey of the after-tax profits of 378 American companies, nearly three-quarters of the companies saw a significant increase in profits in the first half of this year. The total profits of these 378 companies in the first half of this year reached a high of $2,865 million, an increase of 17 percent over the first half of 1952. Among these companies, the companies with the largest profits are those that have received a large number of military orders in the preparedness economy. As for some companies operating in civilian industries, such as agricultural machinery companies, their profits have declined somewhat. In the first half of this year, the profits of aircraft companies, which have greatly prospered in the expansion of armaments and war preparations, more than doubled compared with the first half of last year, the profits of airline companies, which are heavily engaged in the transportation of war materials, increased by 50 percent, the profits of steel companies increased by 62 percent, and the profits of automobile companies, which manufacture large quantities of tanks and military trucks, increased by 13 percent. The profits of other oil companies and railway companies closely related to the war have also increased significantly.

The companies that have made the greatest profits are some of the large companies controlled by American monopoly capital. According to "Time" magazine, in the second quarter of this year, the net profit of United States Steel, controlled by Morgan, was one and a half times greater than in the first quarter of last year, and the net profit of General Motors, controlled by DuPont, increased by 14 percent compared with the second quarter of last year. The net income of Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation, which has increasingly close ties with the Rockefeller family, increased by 13 percent in the first half of the year compared with the first half of 1952, and the profits of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, controlled by the Kuhn-Loeb Group, even more than tripled in the first half of this year compared with the first half of 1952.

    美垄断资本大发横财
    据新华社讯：美国资产阶级报刊刊载的材料表明，在国民经济加紧军事化的过程中，美国垄断资本的利润有增无已，而美国人民的实际收入却不断降低。
    根据一个对美国三百七十八家公司纳税后所获利润的调查，在今年上半年，差不多四分之三的公司的利润都大大增加了。这三百七十八家公司在今年上半年获利的总和高达二十八亿六千五百多万美元，比一九五二年上半年增加了百分之十七。在这些公司中，获利最大的公司都是一些在备战经济中接受了大批军事订货的公司。至于某些经营民用工业的公司，例如农具公司的利润则有若干下降。今年上半年，在扩军备战中大走红运的飞机公司的利润比去年上半年大一倍以上，大量经营战争物资运输的航空公司的利润增加了百分之五十，钢铁公司的利润增加了百分之六十二，大量制造坦克与军用卡车的汽车公司的利润增加了百分之十三。其他与战争密切有关的石油公司与铁路公司的利润也有显著的增加。
    获得最大利润的公司都是美国垄断资本控制的一些大公司。据“时代”周刊说，在今年第二季，摩根控制的美国钢铁公司的纯利润比去年第一季大一倍半，杜邦控制的通用汽车公司的纯利润比去年第二季增加了百分之十四。与洛克菲勒家族关系日益密切的联合炭素及炭化物公司的纯收入在上半年比一九五二年上半年增加百分之十三，库恩—洛伯集团控制的宾夕法尼亚铁路公司在本年上半年的利润甚至比一九五二年上半年大三倍以上。
