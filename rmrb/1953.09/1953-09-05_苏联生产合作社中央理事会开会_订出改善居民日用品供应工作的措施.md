Mikoyan, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Minister of Internal and Foreign Trade of the Soviet Union, A. Petroshev, Chairman of the Central Council of the Soviet Production Cooperative, and more than 500 heads of production cooperative organizations from various Soviet republics, border regions, and states. In accordance with the instructions of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the meeting discussed the work of the first half of the year and the measures to be taken by the enterprises of the production cooperative to improve the supply of residents' daily needs.

Mikoyan delivered a speech at the meeting. He talked about the important tasks of the production cooperatives in expanding production, increasing the variety of products, and especially in improving the quality and style of finished products. Mikoyan emphasized that in addition to continuously supplementing the shortcomings of national industry in the production of consumer goods, production cooperatives should also play an important role in supplying people's daily needs. Therefore, production cooperatives will develop rapidly along with the development of socialist industry.

Based on the work materials of various regions, the meeting formulated measures to improve the production of daily necessities by production cooperatives.

On August 26, "Pravda" published many documents regarding this meeting in a full-page spread. When talking about the scale and achievements of the Soviet production cooperative, "Pravda" said that the distribution network of the Soviet production cooperative includes 126,000 factories and stores, which employ 1,865,000 workers. Forty percent of the furniture products and knitted outerwear, and thirty-five percent of the clothing in the Soviet Union are produced by production cooperatives. The output of various cooperative enterprises in the first half of this year increased by 43 percent compared to 1950. This year, they will produce consumer goods worth 47 billion rubles, compared to 42 billion rubles last year, and 28 billion rubles before the war in 1940. The knitted goods now produced by the cooperative are 2.2 times that of 1940. The furniture produced this year will be twice that of 1940, the metal kitchen utensils will be four times that of 1940, and the output of carpets will be nearly 500,000 square meters. In addition, production cooperatives also manufacture radios, cameras, refrigerators, and various household electrical appliances. "Pravda" said: The enterprises of the Soviet production cooperative have huge production equipment. They have foundries, metal cutting machines, spinning machines, looms, various electric motors, sewing machines, and knitting machines; and old machines are constantly being replaced by new machines. In 1952 and the first half of this year, the Soviet industry has produced 9,000 machines for garment worker cooperatives, and they will receive about 8,000 more machines in the second half of this year.

    米高扬在会上曾发表演说。他谈到了各生产合作社在扩大生产、增加产品种类，特别是在改进制成品的质量和式样方面的重要任务。米高扬着重指出，生产合作社除在消费品生产方面要不断补充国家工业之不足以外，还要在供应人民的日常需要方面起重要的作用。因此，生产合作社将随着社会主义工业的发展而迅速地发展起来。
    会议根据各地区工作的材料，制订了改善生产合作社的日用品生产的措施。
    八月二十六日，“真理报”以整版篇幅刊载了许多关于这次会议的文件。“真理报”在谈到苏联生产合作社的规模和成就时说，苏联的生产合作社的分布网包括十二万六千个工厂和商店，这些工厂和商店拥有一百八十六万五千个工作人员。全苏联百分之四十的家具产品和针织外衣，百分之三十五的服装是由生产合作社生产的。今年上半年各合作社企业的产量比一九五○年增加了百分之四十三。它们在今年将生产价值四百七十亿卢布的消费品，而去年是四百二十亿卢布，战前一九四○年是二百八十亿卢布。合作社现在生产的针织品为一九四○年的二点二倍。今年生产的家具将为一九四○年的两倍，金属厨房用具将为一九四○年的四倍，地毯的产量将近为五十万平方公尺。此外，生产合作社还制造收音机、照相机、冰箱和各种家庭电气用具。“真理报”说：苏联生产合作社的企业都有巨型生产设备。它们有翻砂间、金属切削母机、纺纱机、织布机、各种电动机、缝纫机和针织机；而且旧的机器还不断为新机器所代替。在一九五二年和今年上半年，苏联工业已为成衣工人合作社生产了九千部机器，在今年下半年它们还将得到约八千部机器。
