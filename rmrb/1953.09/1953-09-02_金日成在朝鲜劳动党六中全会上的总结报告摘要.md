Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 1st: The "Labor News" and other newspapers in Korea published on August 30th a summary report by Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Korean Workers' Party. The summary report is divided into three parts: (1) On the Armistice and the Great Cause of National Reunification; (2) On the Post-War Restoration and Development of the People's Economy; (3) On the Work in the Newly Liberated Areas.

Kim Il-sung first spoke of the heroic struggles of the Korean Workers' Party members in all positions on the front lines and in the rear during the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War, which ensured the glorious victory of the war. He said: Today, our Korean Workers' Party has become the vanguard to which the Korean people can entrust their destiny and future without hesitation, the wisdom and honor of the Korean people, and has grown into a strong new and advanced party based on the revolutionary theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

Regarding the armistice and the great cause of Korean reunification, Kim Il-sung said: The armistice is a great victory for us. Although the armistice is not complete peace for Korea, the signing of the armistice agreement is the first step towards a peaceful solution to the Korean problem. By securing the signing of the armistice agreement, we have obtained the possibility of peacefully resolving the issue of our national reunification. Kim Il-sung pointed out: The problem now lies in how to consolidate and develop the armistice victory we have already achieved, and to wage a tenacious struggle for lasting peace in Korea and for the peaceful reunification of the country, thereby transforming existing possibilities into realities.

Kim Il-sung emphasized: With the signing of the armistice agreement, the task before us is to conduct unremitting struggle at the upcoming political conference to achieve a complete and peaceful resolution of our country's problems. He said: If there had been no interference from the American imperialists, our country would have been unified long ago, and our country and people would not have suffered all kinds of pain, disasters, and obstacles due to the division of the motherland. This is very clear. The Korean nation is one nation, Korea belongs to the Korean people, and the Korean problem must be solved by the Korean people themselves. The Korean people absolutely do not want the existence of a divided state, and no aggressive forces can hinder the Korean people's desire and will to reunify their motherland. The upcoming political conference must reflect and support the just demands, wishes, and will of our Korean people, as well as the vital interests of the Korean people. Any plans and conspiracies by imperialist interventionists that contradict this are absolutely intolerable to our Korean people.

Kim Il-sung pointed out: The issue of withdrawing foreign troops from Korea was agreed upon and stated in the armistice agreement. However, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and the traitor Syngman Rhee concluded the so-called "ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty," the purpose of which is to keep American invading forces permanently stationed in South Korea and, if necessary, to violate the armistice agreement and launch another criminal war of aggression in Korea. The so-called "ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty" is an act by which American imperialism openly opposes the peaceful reunification of our country and interferes in our internal affairs; it is a traitorous act by which the Syngman Rhee clique openly sells the southern half of our country to the United States. This action, which occurs when the political conference is about to be held, shows that it is an attempt to hinder a reasonable solution to the Korean problem at the political conference. All our party members and all our people must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance without the slightest slackening, keenly watch the enemy's every move, and always be prepared to discern and crush the enemy's vicious attempts.

When talking about the post-war restoration and development of the people's economy, Kim Il-sung said: Only by rapidly restoring and developing the people's economy that has been destroyed by the war, stabilizing the people's livelihood, and firmly establishing the national economic foundation, can we have a material guarantee for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. All party members must, together with all the people, unite further like steel around the Party Central Committee and the government, and do everything possible to further strengthen the power of the motherland. We have all the conditions and possibilities to successfully complete this task.

Kim Il-sung said: The basic task of this Sixth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee is to mobilize the entire party and the entire people to unite and rise up in order to consolidate and strengthen the revolutionary base of our motherland—the democratic base—to restore and develop the people's economy destroyed by the war, and to fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the solid establishment of a material and economic foundation. Kim Il-sung said: When restoring and developing the people's economy, first, in a period of six months to one year, carry out all the preparatory work and sorting work required for the restoration and development of the people's economy; second, formulate a three-year plan to restore and develop the people's economy so that the various sectors of the people's economy reach pre-war levels; third, formulate a five-year plan for the comprehensive development of the country's industry, and put it into practice, to develop our country into a rich, strong, democratic, and independent country.

Kim Il-sung finally talked about the work in the newly liberated areas. He said: Our work in the newly liberated areas is of great significance. The newly liberated areas—Kaesong, Kaepung, Panmunjom, South Yonbaek, and Ongjin—have hundreds of thousands of people. He pointed out that a series of major tasks must be carried out in these areas.

Kim Il-sung said in the concluding report: I am convinced that, just as in the great Fatherland Liberation War, all our party members and all our people united like steel around the Party and the government, overcame all difficulties and hardships, and achieved a glorious victory, we will also achieve great achievements in completing the military, economic, and political tasks that lie before us after the war.

    金日成在朝鲜劳动党六中全会上的总结报告摘要
    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜“劳动新闻”等报在八月三十日发表了朝鲜劳动党中央委员会委员长金日成在朝鲜劳动党六中全会上所作的总结报告。总结报告共分三部分：（一）关于停战和祖国统一的伟大事业；（二）关于战后人民经济的恢复和发展；（三）关于新解放地区的工作。
    金日成首先谈到在朝鲜人民的祖国解放战争中，朝鲜劳动党员在前线和后方一切岗位上的英勇奋斗，保证了战争的光荣胜利结束。他说：今天，我们朝鲜劳动党已经成为朝鲜人民可以毫不踌躇地把自己的命运和将来相委托的先锋队，成为朝鲜人民的智慧和荣誉，并已发展壮大为坚强的基于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林革命学说的新的先进的党。
    关于停战和朝鲜统一的伟大事业，金日成说：停战对于我们来说，是很大的胜利。停战虽然不是朝鲜的完全和平，但是停战协定的签订是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。我们争取到停战协定的签订，就获得了和平解决我们祖国统一问题的可能性。金日成指出：现在的问题在于：如何巩固和发展我们已经取得的停战胜利，为了我们朝鲜的持久和平，为了祖国的和平统一而展开顽强的斗争，从而使现存的可能性转变为现实性。
    金日成着重指出：随着停战协定的签订，在我们面前提出的任务是：在行将举行的政治会议上，进行不懈的斗争，以取得我国问题的完全和平解决。他说：如果没有美帝国主义者的干涉，我们国家早就统一了，而不会由于祖国的分裂，使我们国家和人民遭受到种种痛苦、灾难和障碍。这是很清楚的事情。朝鲜民族是一个民族，朝鲜是朝鲜人民的，朝鲜问题必须交给朝鲜人民自己解决。朝鲜人民绝对不愿意分裂状态的存在，任何侵略势力也阻碍不了朝鲜人民统一祖国的愿望和意志。行将举行的政治会议，必须反映和拥护我们朝鲜人民的正当主张、愿望和意志及朝鲜人民的切身利益。与此相反的帝国主义干涉分子的任何策划和阴谋，都是我们朝鲜人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    金日成指出：关于从朝鲜撤出外国军队的问题，是在停战协定中同意并作了声明的。但是，美国国务卿杜勒斯和卖国贼李承晚一起，缔结了所谓“韩美共同防御条约”，其目的在于使美国侵略军永远留驻南朝鲜，并在必要时破坏停战协定，再一次在朝鲜发动罪恶的侵略战争。所谓“韩美共同防御条约”是美帝国主义公开反对我国和平统一，干涉我国内政的行为；是李承晚匪帮公开把我国南半部出卖给美国的卖国行为。这种行动发生在政治会议行将召开的时候，说明这是企图妨害在政治会议上合理解决朝鲜问题的行动。我们全体党员和全体人民一定要毫不松懈地保持高度的革命警惕性，锐利地注视敌人的一举一动，经常做好洞悉和粉碎敌人凶恶企图的准备。
    在谈到战后人民经济的恢复和发展问题时，金日成说：只有迅速地恢复和发展被战争破坏了的人民经济，安定人民生活，并巩固地建立国家经济基础，才能使和平统一祖国有了物质保证。全体党员要和全体人民一起，进一步钢铁般地团结在党中央委员会和政府的周围，尽一切努力来进一步加强祖国的力量。我们具备着能够胜利完成这个任务的一切条件和可能性。
    金日成说：这次党中央委员会第六次全体会议的基本任务在于：为了巩固和加强我们祖国的革命源泉地——民主基地，为恢复和发展被战争破坏的人民经济，动员全党和全体人民一致奋起，为和平统一祖国和巩固地建立物质与经济基础而斗争。金日成说：在恢复和发展人民经济的时候，首先要在半年到一年的期间，展开恢复和发展人民经济所需的全部准备工作和整理工作；其次，制订恢复和发展人民经济的三年计划，使人民经济的各部门达到战前水平；第三个阶段，制订全面发展国家工业的五年计划，并付诸实践，把我国发展为富强、民主、独立的国家。
    金日成最后谈到关于新解放地区的工作。他说：我们在新解放地区的工作有着很重要的意义。新解放地区——开城、开丰、板门、南延白、瓮津地区有数十万人口。他指出在这些地区要进行一系列的重大工作。
    金日成在总结报告中最后说：我确信：如同在伟大的祖国解放战争中，我们全体党员和全体人民钢铁般地团结在党和政府的周围，克服一切艰难困苦而取得了光荣胜利一样，在完成战后摆在我们面前的军事、经济和政治任务时，也必将取得巨大的成就。
