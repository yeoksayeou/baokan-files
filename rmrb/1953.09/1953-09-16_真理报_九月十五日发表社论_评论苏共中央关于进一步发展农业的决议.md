Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 15th: Today's "Pravda" published an editorial titled "A Program for the Further Development of Soviet Agriculture," commenting on the resolution passed yesterday by the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the report by Comrade N.S. Khrushchev on measures for the further development of Soviet agriculture. "Pravda" stated that this resolution is of paramount importance to our Party and country, and to all Soviet people who are struggling to build a communist society. The resolution studies in detail the main problems in the further development of Soviet agriculture and points out the path for the rapid development of all sectors of agriculture and the rapid increase in agricultural products.

Soviet socialist agriculture, established and consolidated under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, is based on powerful industrial technology, and it is the largest and most mechanized agriculture in the world. This agriculture has undeniably proven its decisive superiority over small-scale peasant economies and large-scale capitalist agricultural production. The publicly owned economy of collective farms, equipped with modern technology, is constantly developing, and the collective farm system is being increasingly consolidated.

In the years of peaceful construction and in the years of arduous war tests, socialist agriculture has been able to demonstrate its enormous vitality, showing its ability to produce more and more grain for the residents and more and more raw materials for light industry and the food industry.

In the post-war years, grain production has been restored and greatly increased, and the country's grain supply has been guaranteed. The state's purchase of cotton and sugar beets has greatly increased compared to pre-war levels.

Collective farms and state farms have made up for the serious losses suffered by animal husbandry during the war in a short period of time and have greatly increased the number of livestock.

However, the level of agricultural production does not fully meet the growing needs of residents for food and light industry and the food industry for raw materials. The level of agricultural production is not commensurate with the technical equipment of agriculture and the potential of the collective farm system.

The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out that the enormous potential of large-scale socialist agriculture has not been fully utilized. The yield of grain and industrial crops in many collective farms and many regions is still not high. The development of animal husbandry is particularly unsatisfactory.

There are huge shortcomings in potato and vegetable production, which makes it impossible to rapidly improve the supply of these products to the working people in the cities.

The resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union clearly explains the reasons for the insufficient overall level of agricultural production and the backwardness of certain important agricultural sectors.

These reasons are primarily due to the violation of the principle that agricultural workers have a material interest in developing agricultural production and increasing their income, which is one of the fundamental principles of socialist management.

The resolution of the plenary session states that the backwardness in the development of animal husbandry, as well as in vegetable and potato production, is to a large extent due to the state's failure to provide sufficient encouragement for the development of these agricultural sectors.

A major reason for the serious backwardness of some very important agricultural sectors is that the powerful technical equipment supplied by the state to collective farms and state farms is not utilized in a satisfactory manner at all. We have a completely abnormal situation, namely: that only during the period of field work do the collective farms send seasonal workers to the machine and tractor stations to operate modern and complex equipment.

Large-scale socialist agricultural production can only develop smoothly under constant and proper leadership.

The resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union proposes a broad program for the development of all agricultural sectors.

The rapid development of animal husbandry, especially the animal husbandry of collective farms and state farms, is of great importance to the country, and is also the most urgent task of the Party and the government in agriculture today. The resolution of the plenary session points out the specific methods for developing animal husbandry.

The plenary session also formulated a large-scale program to increase the production of potatoes and vegetables. The task is to expand the production of potatoes and vegetables to such an extent in the next two or three years that it will not only fully meet the needs of residents in cities and industrial centers and the processing industry, but also meet the needs of animal husbandry in terms of potatoes.

The resolution of the plenary session formulated a number of measures, the implementation of which will make it possible to increase the total output and marketable output of grain, industrial crops and oil crops. The plenary session believes that grain production is the foundation of all agricultural production, and calls for vigorous development of grain production, especially the production of the most valuable food crops, winter wheat and spring wheat.

The resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stipulates many measures to fundamentally improve the machine and tractor stations and further expand agricultural mechanization.

The Soviet government and the Communist Party are taking many measures to raise the mechanization of agricultural production to a higher level. In the period from 1954 to May 1, 1957, agriculture will receive at least 500,000 general-purpose tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower) and 250,000 tillage tractors.

The implementation of the various measures stipulated by the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union requires the Party, Soviet and agricultural organs to thoroughly improve the leadership of collective farms, state farms and machine and tractor stations.

Collective farms, state farms and machine and tractor stations must be strengthened with skilled personnel. The method is to send experienced agricultural specialists and organizers who are capable of leading the widespread adoption of scientific and advanced methods achievements in agriculture to the countryside, and on this basis, to raise all backward collective farms, state farms and machine and tractor stations to advanced levels.

If the work of the Party organizations is not improved, then the material conditions and possibilities that are now being created for the development of agriculture will not produce the desired results. In order to utilize these possibilities and conditions, the Party organizations must lead the broad masses of collective farmers, machine and tractor station workers and state farm workers and lead them to fight for the upsurge of agriculture.

The Soviet state is advancing confidently along the road to communism. An important component of the communist construction plan is to practically solve the task of producing abundant agricultural products in the Soviet Union, on the basis of the great development of socialist industry – the leading force of the national economy. Under the current circumstances, this task is an urgent task and a task for the entire people. The victorious solution of this task will promote the further consolidation of the alliance between the working class and the collective farmers.

    “真理报”九月十五日发表社论
    评论苏共中央关于进一步发展农业的决议
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日电：今天的“真理报”上发表了题为“进一步发展苏联农业的纲领”的社论，评论昨天发表的苏联共产党中央委员会最近一次全体会议就尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施的报告所通过的决议。“真理报”说，这个决议对于我们党和国家，对于全体为建设共产主义社会而斗争的苏维埃人民，具有头等重要的意义。这个决议详细地研究出了苏联农业进一步发展中的主要问题，并且指明了农业各个部门迅速发展和农产品迅速增加的道路。
    在苏联共产党领导下建立和巩固的苏联社会主义农业，是以强大的工业技术为基础的，它是世界上规模最大、机械化水平最高的农业。这种农业已无可争辩地证明了，它较之小规模的农民经济和大规模的资本主义农业生产具有决定意义的优越性。拥有现代技术设备的集体农庄公有经济正在不断发展，集体农庄制度正日益巩固。
    在和平建设的年代中和在艰苦的战争考验的年代中，社会主义农业都能显示它的巨大的生命力，显示它为居民生产越来越多的粮食、为轻工业和食品工业生产越来越多的原料的能力。
    战后几年中，谷物的产量已经恢复并大大提高了，我们国家谷物的供应有了保证。国家收购棉花和甜菜的数量已经比战前大大地增加。
    集体农庄和国营农场已经在短时期中弥补了饲畜业在战争中所受到的严重损失并且使牲畜头数大大地增加了。
    但是，农业生产水平没有充分满足居民对于粮食及轻工业和食品工业对于原料的日益增长的需要，农业生产水平与农业的技术设备和集体农庄制中的潜力还不相称。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议指出，大规模社会主义农业的巨大潜力仍然没有充分利用。许多集体农庄和许多地区的谷物和工业作物的产量仍然不高。饲畜业的发展情况特别不能令人满意。
    马铃薯和蔬菜生产方面存在有巨大缺点，这使得对城市的劳动人民供应这些产品的工作不能迅速改善。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的决议清楚地说明了整个农业生产水平不够高以及某些重要的农业部门落后的原因。
    这些原因首先就是因为违反了农业工作者在发展农业生产中、在增加自己的收入中有其物质利益这一原则，而这一原则是社会主义经营的根本原则之一。
    全体会议的决议说，在饲畜业发展方面以及蔬菜和马铃薯生产方面的落后，在颇大程度上是由于国家对这些农业部门的发展没有给以足够的鼓励。
    一些非常重要的农业部门的严重落后的一个主要原因是利用国家供给集体农庄和国营农场的效力强大的技术设备的情况完全不能令人满意。我们有一种完全不正常的情况，就是：只有在田间工作的时期各集体农庄才派季节工人到机器拖拉机站去操使现代化的复杂的设备。
    大规模的社会主义农业生产只有在经常适当的领导之下才能顺利地发展。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的决议为发展所有的农业部门提出了一个广泛的方案。
    十分迅速地发展饲畜业，首先是集体农庄和国营农场的饲畜业，对国家具有非常重要的意义，同时是党和政府今天在农业方面最迫切的任务。全体会议的决议指出了发展饲畜业的具体方法。
    全体会议也为增加马铃薯和蔬菜的生产拟订了一个大规模的方案。这个任务是在今后两三年内要把马铃薯和蔬菜的生产扩大到这样一个程度，即是：不但能充分满足城市和工业中心居民和加工工业的需要而且还要满足饲畜业在马铃薯方面的需要。
    全体会议的决议拟出了一些措施，这些措施的实行将使谷物、工业作物和含油作物的总产量和商品产量的增加成为可能。全体会议认为谷物生产是一切农业生产的基础，号召大力发展谷物生产，特别是最珍贵的粮食作物冬小麦和春小麦的生产。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的决议规定了根本地改进各机器拖拉机站和进一步扩大农业机械化的许多措施。
    苏联政府和共产党正在采取许多措施，把农业生产机械化提高到一个更高的水平。在从一九五四年到一九五七年五月一日这一段时期中，农业将至少得到五十万台一般用拖拉机（每部以十五匹马力计算）和二十五万台耕作用拖拉机。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议所规定的各项措施的实行，要求党、苏维埃和农业机关彻底地改进对集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的领导。
    必须以熟练人员来加强集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站。办法是：把那些能够在农业中领导广泛采用科学和先进方法成就的工作的经验丰富的农业专门人材和组织者派到乡下去，并在这个基础上，把所有落后的集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站提高到先进的水平。
    如果不把党组织的工作改进，那么，现在正在为农业的发展而创造的物质条件和可能性就会不能产生应有的效果。为了利用这些可能和条件，党组织必须领导集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场工人的广大群众并领导他们为农业的高涨而斗争。
    苏维埃国家正满怀信心地沿着走向共产主义的道路前进。共产主义建设计划的一个重要组成部分是，在苏联，在社会主义工业——国民经济的主导力量的大大发展的基础上，实际地解决出产丰足的农产品的任务。在目前情况下，这个任务是一个迫切的任务，而且是全体人民的任务。这个任务的胜利解决，将促进工人阶级和集体农民之间的联盟得到进一步的巩固。
