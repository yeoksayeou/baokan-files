After the Completion of the Suihui Canal in Suide County
Crops in the Suburbs Will Have a Bumper Harvest

Outside Suide City, in the old revolutionary base area of northern Shaanxi, a new irrigation canal—the Suihui Canal—has recently been built. This is one of several new irrigation canals built by the People's Government for the people of northern Shaanxi. The canal of the Suihui Canal starts from Wuliwan Village, west of Suide City. Through a high intake gate on the river bank, the river water is diverted into the canal. Then, the quiet flowing water flows along the beautifully stone-paved canal, through a field on a hillside, to the edge of the city. Here, a large stone-built and stone-decorated bridge is also erected. The canal water passes through a culvert built inside the large stone bridge and meanders around Suide City to irrigate more than 1,700 mu of land in the suburbs. In the past, due to water shortage, the land in the suburbs of Suide City could only be planted with one season of sorghum a year. The Suihui Canal was completed last winter and began to release water this spring. This year, the farmers of Suide City planted two seasons of crops on their land for the first time. Following the first bumper harvest in summer, the autumn harvest is about to begin. According to the grain harvest in summer, in the past, each hectare (three mu) could only yield a little more than one dan of grain. After the land was irrigated, the grain yield per hectare increased to more than three dan.

    绥德县绥惠渠修成后
    城郊庄稼将获得丰收
    在陕北老革命根据地的绥德城外，新近建筑了一条灌溉渠——绥惠渠。这是人民政府新近为陕北人民所建设的好几条灌溉渠中的一条。绥惠渠的渠道从绥德城西边的五里湾村开始，通过一座高踞在河岸上的进水闸，将河水引到渠道里面，于是静静的流水就沿着那一道用漂亮的石头镶成的渠道，穿过一片山坡上的田地流到了城边边上，在这里又设立了一座用石头建造、用石头装饰的大桥，渠道的流水通过大石桥里边筑成的暗槽渡过了河，弯弯曲曲地绕着绥德城灌溉城郊一千七百多亩土地。过去因为缺水，绥德城郊的土地一年只能播种一季高粱。绥惠渠在去年冬天落成，今年春天开始放水。绥德城的农民今年第一次在他们的土地上种了两季庄稼，继夏季的第一次丰收之后，目前就要开始秋季的丰收。按照夏季的粮食收获的情况，从前每垧地（三亩）只能打一石多粮食，土地获得灌溉以后，每垧地收获粮食提高到三石以上。
