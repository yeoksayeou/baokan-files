Jiangsu Province's autumn locust control work, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels in the locust-affected areas, has achieved a basic victory.

Due to the failure to completely eliminate the summer locusts, the autumn locust situation was still quite serious. The earliest occurrences in the Weishan Lake and Gaobao Lake areas began in late June. By the end of August, statistics showed that 726,500 mu of land in thirty-three counties and two suburban districts were affected by locusts. Thanks to the attention paid to locust control work by Party committees at all levels, the continued implementation of the central government's policy of "primarily using pesticides to eliminate" migratory locusts, and the understanding of the characteristics of successive summer and autumn locust occurrences, more than 5,200 dusters and a large amount of pesticides were used in areas with dense migratory locusts. Over 401,700 people were mobilized to eliminate them, and more than 100,000 ducks were driven to peck at them. Finally, the migratory locusts that occurred on more than 400,000 mu of land were basically eliminated. In Danyang, Jiangning, Dantu, Wujin, Yangzhong counties, and the suburbs of Nanjing, where rice locusts occurred in large numbers, in addition to using manual capture and lamp trapping, the Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry also specially allocated 200 tons of "666" pesticide powder to supply farmers at a low price for preventing and controlling rice locusts, strongly supporting farmers in eliminating rice locusts and ensuring the safe growth of autumn crops.

Currently, it is crucial to pay close attention to the fact that although the "main force" of the autumn locusts has been eliminated, the remnant locusts in some areas have not yet been cleared. However, some cadres and the masses do not sufficiently recognize the importance of eliminating the remaining locust nymphs, and are complacent and slack, failing to conduct in-depth inspections. In reality, dispersed locusts may migrate and concentrate due to rising lake water, causing harm. The remaining locusts in the receding water areas are already emerging one after another. For example, after in-depth inspection in Yanbei District of Huai'an County, it was discovered that autumn locusts had re-emerged in more than 300 mu of fields in Yunnan, Huating, and Zhouxu townships, and individual townships still had remnant locusts. The failure to completely eliminate summer locusts in the Gaobao Lake area led to the occurrence of a large number of autumn locusts, causing great difficulties in the subsequent autumn locust control work, which should be taken as a serious lesson.

    江苏省秋蝗基本扑灭
    江苏省秋季治蝗工作，在蝗区各级党委领导下，已经获得基本胜利。
    因夏蝗未能彻底消灭，这次秋蝗情况还相当严重，发生最早的微山湖和高宝湖地区，在六月底就已开始见蝗，到八月底统计，在三十三个县两个市郊区有蝗面积共达七十二万六千五百多亩。由于各级党委重视灭蝗工作，继续贯彻了中央防治飞蝗“以药剂扑灭为主”的方针，掌握了夏秋蝗连续发生的特点，在飞蝗密集区使用了五千二百多架喷粉器和大量药剂，动员了四十万一千七百多人工扑灭，赶了十万多只鸭子啄食，终于将发生在四十多万亩面积上的飞蝗基本扑灭。在丹阳、江寗、丹徒、武进、扬中等县和南京市郊大量发生的稻蝗，除了用人工捕捉、灯火诱杀外，省人民政府农林厅也特地拨发了“六六六”药粉二百吨，低价供应农民防治稻蝗，有力地支持了农民扑灭稻蝗，保障了秋季作物的安全生长。
    目前要引起严密注意的是：秋蝗“主力”虽已消灭，部分地区残蝗仍未肃清。但有些干部和群众对扫除残余蝗蝻工作的重要性认识不足，麻痹松懈，不去深入检查。而实际上，分散的蝗虫会因湖水上涨可能迁移，集中为害；水退地区的残蝗已在陆续发生。如淮安县盐北区深入检查后，就发现运南、华亭、周圩等乡在三百多亩田中又发生了秋蝗，个别乡还有残蝗。高宝湖地区因夏蝗没有彻底消灭，以致发生了大量秋蝗，造成后来秋季治蝗工作中的很大困难，这是值得作为严重教训的。
