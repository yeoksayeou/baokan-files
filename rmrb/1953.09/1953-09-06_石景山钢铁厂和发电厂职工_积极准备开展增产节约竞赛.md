Employees of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and Power Plant
Actively Prepare to Launch Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
[Report from this newspaper] The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and Power Plant are actively preparing to launch an increase production and practice economy campaign. Following the Beijing Municipal Party Committee's meeting for Party member cadres of factories and mines, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant convened a meeting of Party member representatives to seriously examine the implementation of the production plan for the first half of the year. It was decided to start in September, focusing on promoting operational plans and establishing responsibility systems, mobilizing the masses to implement Soviet expert suggestions, find shortcuts, propose rationalization proposals, improve equipment, and launch an increase production and practice economy campaign to ensure the comprehensive fulfillment of the state production plan. To conduct the increase production and practice economy campaign in a guided, organized, and methodical manner, an expanded Party committee meeting was held on September 3rd to discuss and arrange the work for the increase production and practice economy campaign. On the 4th, each workshop held meetings of Party member cadres, inviting veteran workers to participate. At these meetings, everyone fully discussed the instructions of the higher Party committee, determining that the increase production and practice economy campaign must revolve around the central work, rely on the strength of the masses to improve enterprise management, and ensure the comprehensive fulfillment of the state plan. Subsequently, each workshop began deliberations. Everyone was in high spirits and enthusiastically expressed their support for the Party's call. An old foreman of the coking furnace said: "Increase production and practice economy is a major national matter, and we must think of more ways to complete this glorious task." Planners and accountants of the Iron Smelting Department expressed their intention to conscientiously do their work and strive to reduce costs. The director of the Transportation Department went to the site to consult with workers to formulate an increase production and practice economy plan. After preliminary detailed calculations, the Foundry Department can increase production and save 2.2 billion yuan, and the Chemical Workshop can increase production and save 2 billion yuan. Larger workshops such as coking, iron smelting, and power are also calculating detailed accounts and researching discussions. The plant decided to hold an increase production and practice economy mobilization meeting within the day, calling on all employees to launch a campaign.
    The Shijingshan Power Plant also seriously reviewed its work in the first half of the year. Since April of this year, the plant has launched regular production competitions to achieve operational plans, solving many key issues and problems in production. For example, the temperature of the turbine's circulating water is two degrees lower than the same period last year, saving coal; the turbine's heat recovery efficiency has also improved; the boiler has improved combustion, reducing the outlet temperature of gas and reducing combustibles in the ash, improved dust blowing to maintain the cleanliness of the heating surface; and strengthened the dispatch of turbines and boilers. Through regular competitions, the plant implemented operating procedures and achieved operational plans, comprehensively overfulfilling the state production plan in the first half of the year and in July and August. In regular competitions, the plant also adopted the method of summarizing and evaluating to prevent the phenomenon of simply competing for scores in past competitions. Through summaries, advanced experiences in production were exchanged in a timely manner. For example, worker Su Yongshun improved the dust blowing operation method, which was summarized and promoted. Fan Baozhang, the leader of another team, learned and created a new dust blowing method. As a result, the work of each workshop has been greatly improved. After reviewing the work in the first half of the year, the General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Shijingshan Power Plant decided to focus on the central work of the plant in the second half of the year: promoting operational plans, consolidating original records, implementing operating procedures, proposing key issues and problems for increasing production and practicing economy, mobilizing all employees to discuss, propose guarantee measures, and launch a campaign. On the afternoon of September 4th, the plant held a meeting of Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres to discuss the principles and methods of the increase production and practice economy campaign. In the afternoon and evening of the same day, each workshop held meetings to prepare for the competition. Labor model Liu Dezhen actively studied advanced experiences, looked for shortcuts, and prepared to participate in the competition.

    积极准备开展增产节约竞赛
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂和发电厂积极准备开展增产节约竞赛。在北京市厂矿企业党员干部会议之后，石景山钢铁厂接着召开了党员代表大会，认真检查了上半年生产计划的执行情况，并决定从九月开始以推行作业计划和建立责任制为中心，发动群众贯彻苏联专家建议、找窍门、提合理化建议、改善设备，展开增产节约竞赛，保证全面完成国家生产计划。为了有领导、有组织、有办法地开展增产节约竞赛，九月三日，又召开了党委扩大会议，讨论和布置了开展增产节约竞赛的工作，四日，各车间分别召开了党员干部会议，并邀请了老工人参加。在这些会议上，大家充分讨论了上级党委的指示，确定增产节约竞赛必须围绕中心工作进行，必须依靠群众力量改善企业管理，保证全面完成国家计划。随后，各车间开始进行酝酿，大家情绪很高，热烈表示拥护党的号召。炼焦炉老工长说：增产节约是国家的大事，一定要多想办法完成这一光荣任务。炼铁部的计划员、核算员表示要认真作好自己的工作，为降低成本而努力。运输部主任为制订增产节约计划，到现场和工人商量。在初步算细账以后，铸造部可增产节约二十二亿元，化工车间可增产节约二十亿元。炼焦、炼铁、动力等较大车间也正在算细账和研究讨论。该厂决定日内举行增产节约动员大会，号召全体职工开展竞赛。
    石景山发电厂也认真检查了上半年的工作。该厂从今年四月份开始为实现作业计划发动经常性的生产竞赛以来，解决了许多生产中的关键和课题，如汽机循环水的温度比去年同时期降低两度，节省了用煤；汽机热收回效率也有提高；锅炉改进燃烧，降低了瓦斯出口温度，降低灰中可燃物，改进吹尘，保持受热面的清洁；并加强了汽机锅炉的调度等工作。该厂通过经常性的竞赛贯彻了操作规程，实现了作业计划，上半年及七、八月份全面超额地完成了国家生产计划。该厂在经常性的竞赛中还采取了总结评比的办法，防止了过去竞赛中单纯争分数的现象。通过总结及时交流了生产中的先进经验，如工人苏永顺改进了吹尘操作法，经过总结加以推广，另一班班长范宝璋学习以后又创造了新的吹尘法。这样做的结果，使各个车间的工作都有了很大的提高。中共石景山发电厂总支委员会在检查上半年的工作之后，决定围绕全厂下半年的中心工作：推行作业计划、整顿原始记录、贯彻操作规程，提出增产节约的关键和课题，发动全体职工讨论，提出保证措施，开展竞赛。九月四日下午，该厂召开了党、行政、工会、青年团干部会议，讨论了增产节约竞赛的方针、办法等问题。当天下午及晚间，各车间分别开会，进行竞赛准备工作。劳动模范刘德珍积极学习先进经验，找窍门，准备投入竞赛。
