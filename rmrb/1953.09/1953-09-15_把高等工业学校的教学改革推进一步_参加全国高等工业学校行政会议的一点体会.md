The National Administrative Conference of Higher Industrial Schools, convened by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government from July 15th to August 3rd, examined the serious shortcomings of excessive demands and haste that were universally present in past teaching reforms, and discussed ways to correct these shortcomings in order to implement the policy of "consolidation and rectification, focusing on key development, improving quality, and advancing steadily." Because the conference was well-prepared, the issues were clearly defined, and the solutions were relatively thorough, the conference was very fruitful.

Over the past year, all universities and colleges, based on the ideological reform and study movement, have studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and engaged in teaching reform, generally achieving great success; however, due to insufficient understanding of the long-term and complex nature of teaching reform, many serious shortcomings have also arisen.

First of all, regarding the study of Soviet experience, instead of proceeding step by step, gradually understanding its essence, there was a tendency to mechanically copy it, attempting to achieve quick results. For example, the Soviet five-year teaching plan was transplanted to our four-year undergraduate program. Although schools have revised their teaching plans several times, they generally have not thoroughly understood the basic spirit of each teaching procedure and course in the Soviet teaching plan, as well as their interrelationships. Often, decisions were made hastily based on superficial understanding, leading to many problems. For example, when adopting Soviet textbooks, in most cases, teachers were not given the necessary time to conduct a thorough study of the Soviet textbooks, to understand their political and ideological nature, to understand their spirit of combining theory and practice, to understand their scientific systematicness and rigor, to understand how this course connects and cooperates with other courses, to understand its essential differences from British and American textbooks, and so on. On the contrary, teachers were often rushed, some even picking up a Russian textbook, not even having time to read it from beginning to end, and not understanding its entire content, before starting to teach, while learning, translating, printing, and lecturing at the same time. Under these circumstances, despite the excellence of the textbook content, the high enthusiasm of the teachers, and the very active learning of the students, the teaching effect could not help but be greatly limited, and the phenomenon of teachers and students being overwhelmed could not be avoided.

The shortcomings in our work are also reflected in the fact that we did not seriously study the historical development process of Soviet experience, nor did we seriously study our country's current developing needs and objective conditions, so as to obtain the correct application of Soviet experience in our country. Taking the training objectives of undergraduate majors as an example, this is a fundamental issue, but it has never been clearly resolved before this conference. In the Soviet Union, the undergraduate professional teaching plan of higher industrial schools stipulates that graduating students are engineers in a certain major (as a title, not a position). Last year, when setting up majors and determining teaching plans in higher industrial schools across the country, although the words "so-and-so (nature) engineer" were copied into the teaching plans of undergraduate majors, the understanding of the meaning of the word "engineer" here was very vague and divided: some believed that the students trained must reach the level of an engineer; some believed that it was problematic to take on the role of an engineer all at once, but they should be qualified as assistant engineers; some even believed that "this is just a matter of form" and has nothing to do with the teaching plan or content. The confusion of understanding reached this point. However, we did not carefully study what conditions the Soviet training objectives were based on, what historical changes had occurred; what differences there were between our current conditions and those of the Soviet Union, and how to refer to Soviet experience to solve this problem according to our conditions, so the problem has been dragging on. For example, in the Soviet teaching plan, it is very common to schedule about ten courses per week, and some even have as many as twelve or thirteen. According to Soviet experts, there are many advantages to this arrangement, and it has indeed been effective in the Soviet Union. However, we did not carefully study what the main reasons for its effectiveness in the Soviet Union were, and what our current subjective conditions were, so we rashly transplanted it, resulting in students feeling overwhelmed.

Our shortcomings are also reflected in the fact that we did not deeply realize that the process of teaching reform is also a process of further ideological transformation for teachers. As a result, in teaching reform, we abandoned the fundamental and pursued the superficial, failing to focus on ideological leadership, helping teachers establish correct positions and viewpoints, and allowing them to fully exert free thinking and engage in debates, in order to gradually solve fundamental problems in ideological aspects; instead, we allowed them to talk about business for business's sake, so that much work was entangled in some trivial issues, and failed to better improve teachers' professional level around the socialist ideological system. On the other hand, it separated political work from teaching work, thus forming a phenomenon in the schools that political work suddenly "had nowhere to be used" after the basic end of the political reform movement in various schools. This situation, in which political and professional work urgently needed to be combined but could not be well combined, made most teachers who urgently wanted to make progress feel distressed, and made a small number of teachers with relatively vague understanding even more neglect politics, and the deepening and improvement of teaching reform could not but be affected.

Our past understanding of "improving quality" was also incomplete. Needless to say, the improvement of teaching quality must take the improvement of students' quality as its specific goal, and must also take the improvement of students' quality as its specific indicator. However, how students' quality is considered to be improved and how it can be improved are also issues that have not been well resolved. In higher industrial schools, although no one has put forward the slogan of "business first" or "business only," after the ideological reform and study movement, such thoughts exist in a considerable number of teachers and students. They regard the level of professional learning quality and the amount of professional learning as the specific and only representation of the level of students' quality; and here, the level of professional learning quality is often confused with the amount. In this way, strengthening professional learning has become synonymous with improving quality, thus creating a tendency to neglect health, neglect political and ideological education, and simply demand too much, too quickly, and greedily advance in professional teaching. We have discovered that although the students' professional learning is already overwhelming, everyone agrees not to say that they are busy, because they are afraid that after saying the word "busy," the leaders will streamline the curriculum, tighten the teaching content, or slow down the pace. The students' enthusiasm for learning is certainly invaluable, but such an approach is clearly harmful and unhelpful. Facts have proved that the result of this tendency is not only damage to the health of the majority of teachers and students and obstruction to the improvement of political understanding, but even professional teaching itself has not achieved the desired results.

These serious shortcomings that existed in teaching reform over the past year or so were thoroughly examined at the National Administrative Conference of Higher Industrial Schools, their harms were analyzed, and the main causes of their occurrence were investigated, which made us clearly recognize many problems.

We clearly recognize that studying the Soviet Union must be done seriously and steadily. We are not afraid of learning less or learning slowly; but we must learn thoroughly and learn well. As far as formulating teaching plans is concerned, precisely because our understanding of Soviet advanced experience is still very incomplete and not very profound, we would rather have fewer course categories and homework content than be greedy for more. Only in this way will teachers have enough time to study in depth, and students will have enough time to "digest." In this way, whether it is from the perspective of students' learning effectiveness, the improvement of teachers' quality, or the progress of the entire teaching reform, it is beneficial.

We clearly recognize how studying the Soviet Union should be combined with China's actual situation. The so-called actual situation has two aspects: on the one hand, it is the "big actual situation," that is, the situation and needs of the entire country in development; on the other hand, it is the "small actual situation," including various subjective conditions of higher education itself, such as the number and level of teachers, the level of students, the equipment of books and instruments, and so on. When applying Soviet advanced experience, we must both "know them" and "know ourselves." Only in this way can the two be properly combined to achieve good results. Taking the training objectives of undergraduate majors in higher industrial schools as an example, the Soviet Union trains engineers, and what about us? We should affirm that this must be taken as the direction of our efforts; but at present, generally speaking, we can only require training engineers who are suitable for China's actual situation and scientific and technological level. At the same time, the conference pointed out that such a general requirement should also be stretched or contracted according to the different situations and conditions when it is taken to different schools and different majors, and should not be forced to be uniform.

We clearly recognize that the process of studying the Soviet Union and engaging in teaching reform is also a process of further ideological transformation for teachers. Therefore, in the process of teaching reform, we must strengthen political and ideological leadership, so that political work and professional work are gradually closely combined. In terms of working methods, we must avoid the method of "launching movements," avoid administrative orders, superficiality, and simplistic methods, advocate in-depth and meticulous methods, and patiently help teachers study political theory and study Soviet advanced science and technology. Only in this way can teaching reform be gradually improved on a solid foundation.

We clearly recognize that the cadres trained by the school should take the standard of being able to meet the specifications required by national construction. As cadres for national construction, they need to have a high degree of political awareness, be able to master modern scientific and technological knowledge, and also have a sound physique. Only in this way can they play an active role in construction positions and creatively solve problems. Therefore, the cultivation of students must start from an overall perspective, and first of all, in accordance with Chairman Mao's spirit of "health first," ensure that students have a sound physique; on this basis, make students' professional learning and political training advance side by side and continuously improve.

We have clearly recognized these issues, and we have a more comprehensive and profound understanding of the essence of the policy of "consolidation and rectification, focusing on key development, improving quality, and advancing steadily," so it is possible to further promote teaching reform.

    把高等工业学校的教学改革推进一步
    ——参加全国高等工业学校行政会议的一点体会
    武汉大学水利学院院长　张瑞瑾
    中央人民政府高等教育部在七月十五日到八月三日召开的全国高等工业学校行政会议，检查了过去在教学改革中普遍存在的要求过高过急的严重缺点，讨论了纠正缺点以贯彻执行“整顿巩固，重点发展，提高质量，稳步前进”这一方针的办法。由于会议的准备工作充分，问题提得明确，解决得也比较彻底，因而会议的收获也较大。
    一年多来，各高等学校在思想改造学习运动的基础上，学习苏联先进经验，从事教学改革，一般地都取得了很大的成绩；但是，由于对教学改革的长期性、复杂性认识不足，因而也产生了许多严重缺点。
    首先，就学习苏联经验来说，不是循序渐进，逐步体会其精神实质，而是生吞活剥，企图速成。例如将苏联五年制教学计划搬到我们的四年制本科来，各校虽几经修订教学计划，但对苏联教学计划里面的各个教学程序、各个课程的基本精神，以及它们之间的相互联系，一般地是没有彻底了解的，往往只是根据表面的认识，仓卒作出决定，以致发生了许多问题。又如在采用苏联教材时，大多数的情况，不是给予教员以必需的时间，使有机会对苏联教材先作一番缜密研究，了解它的政治思想性，了解它的理论和实际相结合的精神，了解它的科学系统性和严密性，了解这一门课程和其他课程如何衔接配合，了解它和英美教材的本质区别，等等；相反，往往是让教员仓卒从事，有的教员甚至抓起一本俄文教材，还来不及从头到尾地翻阅一遍，根本不了解它的全部内容，便边学、边译、边印、边讲地开起课来。在这种情况下，尽管教材内容优越，教师的工作热情很高，同学学习得非常积极，但教学效果，仍不能不大受限制，而师生忙迫的现象，也无从避免。
    我们工作中的缺点还表现在学习苏联经验而不认真研究苏联经验的历史发展过程，不认真研究我国目前不断发展着的需要和主客观条件，从而求得苏联经验在我国的正确运用。拿本科各个专业的培养目标来说，这是一个根本性质的问题，但在这次会议以前，始终未曾明确地予以解决。在苏联，高等工业学校的本科专业教学计划中，规定毕业学生为某一专业的工程师（是称号，不是职位）。去年在全国各高等工业学校设置专业订定教学计划的时候，虽然在本科各专业的教学计划中也照抄了“某某（性质）工程师”的字样，但对此处“工程师”一词的含义究竟如何，认识是十分模糊而纷歧的：有的认为所培养的学生一定要达到工程师的水平；有的认为一下子担当工程师是有问题的，但应该够得上助理工程师的条件；有的甚至认为“这只是形式问题”，和教学计划、教学内容是没有什么联系的。认识之紊乱，一至于此。可是我们并没有仔细研究苏联的培养目标究竟是根据什么条件确定的，历史上有过什么样的变化；我们目前的条件和苏联的有什么不同，怎样按照我们的条件，参照苏联经验，来解决这一问题，所以问题也就一直拖了下来。又如在苏联教学计划中，每星期排十门左右的课是很常见的，有的还多到十二、三门。据苏联专家解释，这样安排，有很多好处，而且在苏联也确实行之有效。但我们未仔细研究在苏联行之有效的主要原因何在，以及目前我们的主观条件如何，便贸然硬搬过来，结果使学生感到忙迫不堪。
    我们的缺点也表现在没有深刻地意识到教学改革的过程，同时也就是教师进一步的思想改造过程。以致在教学改革中舍本逐末，不抓紧思想领导，帮助教师树立正确的立场、观点，使他们充分发挥自由思考，展开争辩，以求逐步地解决思想方面的根本问题；而是听任他们就业务谈业务，使得许多工作，纠缠在一些枝枝节节的问题上，而未能环绕着社会主义思想体系，更好地提高教师的业务水平。另一方面，又使政治工作脱离教学工作，从而形成了在各校政治改革运动基本结束以后，学校里的政治工作一时竟“无用武之地”的现象。这种政治和业务亟需结合而又未能很好结合的情况，使大多数迫切要求进步的教师陷于苦闷，而使少数认识比较模糊的教师更加忽视政治，教学改革的深入和提高，便不能不受到影响。
    我们过去对于“提高质量”的理解，也是不全面的。不待说，教学质量的提高，须以学生质量的提高为其具体目的，也须以学生质量的提高为其具体指标。但学生质量如何才算得提高，如何才能提高，也是一直没有很好解决的问题。在高等工业学校中，虽然没有谁提出“业务第一”或“业务唯一”的口号，但在思想改造学习运动以后，这样的思想在为数不少的一部分师生中，是存在着的。他们把业务学习质量之高低和分量之多寡，看作是学生质量高低的具体而唯一的表征；而且在这里，业务学习质量之高低，又往往是和分量之多寡混淆不清的。这样，加强业务学习便成了提高质量的同义语，从而产生了忽视健康，忽视政治思想教育，单纯地在业务教学方面要求过高过急、贪多冒进的倾向。我们曾经发现这种情况：同学们的业务学习虽然已经忙迫不堪，但大家相约不肯说忙，原因是怕说出“忙”字以后，领导方面会精简课程、紧缩教学内容、或放慢进度。同学们在学习上的这种积极性固然弥足珍贵，但这样的作法显然是有害无益的。事实证明，这种倾向所造成的结果，不仅使广大师生的健康受到损失，政治认识的提高受到阻碍，就连业务教学本身也未收到应有的效果。
    过去一年多来在教学改革中存在的这些严重缺点，在全国高等工业学校行政会议上作了深入的检查，分析了它们的危害性，追究了它们所以产生的主要根源，使我们明确认识了许多问题。
    我们明确认识了学习苏联必须认真地学，踏踏实实地学。不怕学得少，学得慢；而要学得透，学得好。就订定教学计划来说，正由于我们对苏联先进经验了解得还很不全面、很不深刻，对于课程门类、作业内容的安排，就宁可少些，而不宜贪多。只有如此，教师才有足够的时间深入研究，同学也才有足够的时间“消化”。这样，无论就同学学习效果说，就师资质量提高说，或就整个教学改革的进展说，都是有利的。
    我们明确认识了学习苏联应当怎样结合中国实际。所谓实际，有两方面：一方面是“大实际”，即整个国家在发展中的情况和需要；另一方面是
  “小实际”，包括高等教育本身的各种主观条件，如师资数量及水平、学生程度、图书仪器设备等等。在运用苏联先进经验时，既要“知彼”，又要“知己”。只有如此，才能使两者恰当结合，收到良好效果。拿高等工业学校本科专业的培养目标来说，苏联是培养工程师，我们呢，应该肯定须以此作为努力的方向；但在目前，一般说来，我们还只能要求培养适合中国实际情况和科学技术水平的工程师。同时，会议中并指出了，这样一个一般的要求，拿到各个不同的学校和不同的专业去执行时，还应视情况条件之不同，有所伸缩，而不宜强求一律。
    我们明确认识了学习苏联从事教学改革的过程，也就是教师进一步进行思想改造的过程。因而在教学改革过程中，必须加强政治思想领导，使政治工作和业务工作逐步紧密地结合起来。在工作方式上须避免“搞运动”的方式，避免行政命令、表面化、简单化的方式，提倡深入细致的作法，耐心地帮助教师学习政治理论，学习苏联先进的科学技术。这样才能使教学改革在坚实的基础上循序渐进，逐步提高。
    我们明确认识了学校培养出来的干部，应该以能满足国家建设所要求的规格为标准。作为国家建设干部，需要有高度的政治觉悟，能掌握现代科学技术知识，同时还须具有健全的体魄。只有如此，才能在建设岗位上发挥积极作用，创造性地解决问题。因此，对于学生的培养，必须从全面着眼，首先应按毛主席所指示的“健康第一”的精神，保证学生有健全的体魄；在这一基础上，使学生的业务学习和政治锻炼相辅并进，不断提高。
    我们明确认识了这些问题，对于“整顿巩固，重点发展，提高质量，稳步前进”这一方针的精神实质，便有了较为全面而深刻的理解，因而就有可能把教学改革推进一步。
