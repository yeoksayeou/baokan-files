    A Summer of Victory
    By our reporter Chen Yongjin
    For several years, the workers in the Northeast forest region have dreamed and experimented with working in the summer as they do in the winter. Because only in this way can they produce more timber and meet the needs of national construction.
    Their dream began to come true in Dailing this year.
    At the end of July, I took a small train north from Dailing, a prosperous small town, and entered the primeval forest area. The small train took people directly to the logging site. Several clean small wooden houses were located by the river. The workers used white birch poles to enclose their courtyards. This is the First Logging Site of the Dailing Experimental Bureau of the Northeast Forest Industry Administration. The people here have successfully completed their summer operations.
    Conducting summer operations is not an easy task. Zhao Zhiyu, the head of the logging site, a shrewd young member of the Communist Youth League, led me to a small hilltop northeast of the residence. From here, you can see the entire production scene of the First Logging Site. It is strange that they started logging here last winter, but the forest area they are logging now is right in front of them. Zhao Zhiyu explained to me that to carry out summer operations, the forest area must be carefully selected. The current logging area has a steep slope, smaller trees, and good soil, which is suitable for summer operations. If the trees are too large, it will be difficult to transport them; if the slope of the mountain is too small, the new tools cannot be used. Zhao Zhiyu described here the failure of his previous attempts at summer operations. In 1951, the higher authorities assigned him to conduct summer operations on a trial basis at the Huanan Forestry Farm. There were more workers than now, but they only hauled down 2,000 cubic meters of wood in about twenty days. At that time, there were no new tools, and they just relied on old oxen. The forest farm was not well selected. The logging area was a relatively flat area, and the trees were thick. The ground was muddy, and the oxen sank every step of the way, tired and unable to pull. In addition, the technicians did not carefully investigate the forest farm, pointing to this forest and saying that there were 20,000 cubic meters, and that forest saying that there were 30,000 cubic meters. The leading cadres did not check, and they approved the logging plan. As a result, there were no more trees after logging 10,000 cubic meters. All this led to the failure of their summer operations. Last winter, the higher authorities transferred Zhao Zhiyu to the First Logging Site to prepare for a trial summer operation. This time, he learned from the previous failure. First, he personally explored and selected the forest area with the technicians. He calculated which forest area to work on in which quarter, and even which area to work on in which month. However, when logging began in the distant forest area in the winter, many people, seeing the difficulties at the time, suggested to him to log the nearby forest area first. Zhao Zhiyu resolutely refused. Because he knew that if he did that, they would still fail in the summer. In order to create conditions for the success of summer operations, they launched a campaign to learn advanced experiences and create and improve tools last winter. Old worker Deng Songtian created a wooden slide, which enabled them to transport a large amount of wood. They also learned the timber transport tool created by the Liaodong forest area - the single-axle skid. From where we were standing, we could see from time to time on the opposite hillside where logging was being carried out, the single-axle skid speeding down from the mountainside along a simple forest railway. Several large logs were stacked on two iron wheels, and behind the iron wheels was a short piece of wood. People rode behind the wood. Although its speed was fast, it was very safe. Zhao Zhiyu pointed to the speeding single-axle skid and said to me that the promotion of advanced tools should also depend on the specific situation. Not all forest areas here use single-axle skids, nor do they use this timber transport tool all year round. This new type of tool is most suitable for summer and can only be used on the middle storage yard (that is, the place where timber is stored in the middle). If it is used in a place with too steep a slope, it will be unsafe; in a place with a small slope, the trolley (equivalent to the car skin pulled by a large train) can come up, and there is no need for a single-axle skid.
    After a while, we saw another ox, pulling a piece of wood along the simple forest railway with difficulty from the mountain, directly to the place where the single-axle skid started transporting wood. In areas where semi-mechanized operations are used, the continued use of heavy oxen to transport wood aroused my surprise. Zhao Zhiyu explained to me that the cost is the lowest and the simplest to use oxen for small concentration (collecting scattered wood) on the mountain in summer.
    On another hillside with a gentle slope, an even stranger thing happened. The ox climbed up the mountain, pulling the trolley from the middle of the narrow-gauge railway. In order to reduce costs, they used oxen to pull the trolley up, and when the trolley was full, they used manpower to slowly lower the trolley down the mountain, and then use a small train to pull it out. This reduces the complicated procedures of loading, unloading and consolidating (gathering the wood together). The cost of timber is reduced in these many dissimilar operation methods.
    A certain organizational form is equally important for completing production tasks. The labor organization of the First Logging Site is not completely the same, but varies with the use of tools and with the seasons. In places with large slopes, workers are divided into three groups: one group using new tools, one group using ox and horse teams, and another group of logging workers. But it is different in places near the narrow-gauge railway. One group of workers is responsible for the entire production process - from logging to loading on trolleys. Why do they adopt such an organization? Zhao Zhiyu said: mainly because the trees in this forest area are small and close to the narrow-gauge railway. A group of eight people flexibly carries out work according to the weather. When the weather is hot and humid, there is no wind in the forest, so they stop logging and transport wood; when the weather is cool in the morning and there are fewer mosquitoes, they log or make materials. Last December, Zhao Zhiyu saw from the account books that the workers in Deng Songtian's group were not reaching the quota. He immediately studied the problem. The reason was that when they used new tools, they still adopted the old large mixed labor organization of nearly twenty people. The division of labor between those who carried wood, those who drove cattle, and those who used new tools was unclear, and their enthusiasm was not brought into play. Based on these circumstances, Zhao Zhiyu decided to change the labor organization and divide them into three groups with a clear division of labor. Afterwards, they all exceeded the quota.
    The one hundred or so workers and ten or so staff members of this small logging site are responsible for the task of producing more than 20,000 cubic meters of timber; they are also responsible for the entire production process from logging to transportation. However, due to the promotion of new tools, flexible application, and good labor organization, the workers can still rest and study on time, which has changed the past phenomenon of excessive fatigue caused by the rush work of forestry workers. Their life is happy. Every evening, the songs of gramophone records are heard from the workers' wooden houses, some people play poker, some people play gongs and drums, some people play the erhu or play ball, and some people take baths in the bathhouse. The workers have personally experienced the benefits of year-round operations. In previous years, in order to complete the logging task in one winter, their labor was very rushed. The workers went out under the stars every day and returned under the stars. The people who drove the livestock rushed to transport them day and night, sometimes so tired that they fell asleep holding their long whips, and sometimes they fell asleep while eating with their rice bowls in their hands, not even knowing that the bowls had fallen to the ground and broken. Even with such hard work, they still could not complete the task. Now the workers here announce that they have won the summer, year-round operations have been successful, and they can produce evenly on a quarterly and monthly basis. This is a happy event in forestry production.

    胜利的夏天
    本报记者　陈勇进
    几年来，东北林区的职工们理想着，试验着在夏天也能像冬天那样的工作。因为只有这样，他们才能生产更多的木材，适应国家建设的需要。
    他们的理想，今年开始在带岭实现了。
    七月底，我从一个繁荣的小城镇——带岭乘小火车往北，进入原始森林地带。小火车一直把人带到采伐的地方去。几座干净的小木房，座落在小河边。职工们用白色的桦树杆围成了自己的院墙。这就是东北森林工业管理局带岭实验局的第一伐木场。这里的人们已胜利地完成了夏季作业的任务。
    进行夏季作业是件很不容易的事。伐木场场长赵志宇，一个精明的青年团员，把我领到住地东北的一个小山头上。从这里可以看到第一伐木场的全部生产情景。很奇怪，他们在这里进行采伐是从去年冬季开始的，但他们现在采伐的林场，却就在跟前。赵志宇向我作了说明。要实行夏季作业，必须认真选择林场。现在采伐的地方，山的坡度大，树木径级较小和土质好，适合夏季作业。如果树木径级过大了，搬运困难；山的坡度小了，新工具利用不上。赵志宇在这里叙述了他以前尝试夏季作业失败的情形。一九五一年上级指定他在桦南林场试行夏季作业，那时的工人可比现在多，但二十来天只拉下来两千立方公尺木头。那时也没有新工具，就指望着用老牛干，林场也没有好好选择，采伐的林场是比较平坦的地带，树木的径级又粗，满地泥水，牛拉上木材一步一陷，累得伸着舌头也拉不动。加上技术员没有认真地调查林场，指着这片树林说有两万立方公尺，那片树林说有三万立方公尺，领导干部也没有检查，就批准了采伐计划。结果采伐了一万立方公尺就没有树木了。这一切，使他们的夏季作业失败了。去年冬天上级又调赵志宇到第一伐木场准备试行夏季作业，这次他接受了前次失败的教训，他首先亲自和技术员一起勘探，选择林场。哪
  一季度做哪一带的林场，甚至哪一月做哪一带都计算好了。可是，当冬季在较远的林场开始采伐的时候，有不少的人，看到当时的困难，就向他建议先采伐近的林场。赵志宇都坚决拒绝了。因为他知道，如果那样做仍然会使他们在夏天再遭到失败。为了给夏季作业的成功创造条件，去年冬天他们掀起了学习先进经验和创造、改进工具的运动。老工人邓松田创造了木滑道，使他们能搬运下来大批的木材。他们又学习了辽东林区创造的运材工具——单轴滑杠。从我们站着的地方就不时可以看到对面正在进行采伐的山坡上，单轴滑杠沿着简易森林铁道从半山腰里疾驰下来。几根大木头垛在两个铁轮身上，铁轮后面是一根不长的木头，人就骑在木头的后面，它的速度虽然快，但是很安全。赵志宇指着疾驰的单轴滑杠对我说，推广先进工具，还要看具体情况。他们这里并不是所有的林场都用单轴滑杠，也不是一年四季都用这种运材工具。这种新式工具最适宜于夏季，并且只能用在归中楞（即中间贮放木材的场所）上。如果用在坡度过大的地方，就会不安全；在坡度小的地方，台车（等于大火车拉的车皮）就能上来，用不着单轴滑杠了。
    一会儿，我们又看到一头牛，沿着简易森林铁道拉着一棵木头艰难地从山上下来，直拉到单轴滑杠起运木材的地方。在运用半机械化作业方式的地区，还继续使用笨重的牛来拉运木材，引起了我的诧异。赵志宇向我解释说：夏季在山上实行小集中
  （把分散的木材集中起来），只有用牛拉的办法成本才最低，也最简便。
    在另一个坡度不大的山坡上，又出现了更奇怪的事情，牛从轻便铁道中间拉着台车爬上山来。他们为了降低成本，利用牛把台车拉上去，等到装满台车的时候再用人力把台车慢慢地放下山来，然后再用小火车牵引出去。这样就减少了装卸和归楞（把木头集中在一起）的繁杂手续。木材的成本，就在这许多四不像的作业方式里降低了。
    一定的组织形式，对于完成生产任务，也有同等重要的意义。第一伐木场的劳动组织，并不是完全一样的，是随着运用工具的情况，随着季节变动的。在山坡大的地方工人分成三组：使用新工具的一组，用牛马套子的一组，采伐工人又一组。但在那靠小火车道近便地方的又不同了，一组工人就担负着全部生产过程的工作——从采伐一直到装上台车。他们为什么采用这样的组织呢？赵志宇说：主要是因为这个林场的树木径级小，靠小火车道近。一组八个人，根据天气的好坏灵活进行工作。天气闷热的时候，树林里没有风，他们就停止采伐，搬运木材；早晨天气凉爽，蚊子又少，他们就进行采伐或造材。去年十二月，赵志宇从账面上看到邓松田组的工人达不到定额，马上研究这个问题，原因是他们使用新工具的时候，仍然采用过去近二十个人的大混合劳动组织，组里面抬木头的、赶牛的和使用新工具的分工不清，积极性都没有发挥出来。赵志宇根据这些情况就决定改变劳动组织，把他们分成三个小组，有了明确分工。以后，他们都超过了定额。
    这个小伐木场的一百多个工人和十来个职员担负着生产两万多立方公尺木材的任务；他们也担负着从采伐到搬运的全部生产过程。但是由于推广了新式工具，灵活地加以运用，劳动组织得好，职工们仍能按时作息和学习，已经改变了过去林业工人突击性的作业所造成的过度疲劳现象。他们的生活是愉快的。每当黄昏的时候，工人们的木房里传出留声机唱片的歌声，有的人打扑克，有的人在打锣鼓，也有的人在拉胡琴或打球，有的在澡塘里洗澡。工人们已经亲身体会到常年作业的好处。往年为了在一个冬季完成采伐任务，他们的劳动带着很大的突击性。工人们天天顶着星星出去，顶着星星回来。赶牲口的人们突击搬运，日以继夜，有时累得抱着长鞭就睡着了，有时吃着饭捧着饭碗就睡着了，连碗掉在地上打碎了都不知道。就是这样辛劳，还是不能完成任务。现在这里的职工们宣布他们赢得了夏天，常年作业成功了，他们就能按季按月均衡地生产了。这是林业生产的喜事。
