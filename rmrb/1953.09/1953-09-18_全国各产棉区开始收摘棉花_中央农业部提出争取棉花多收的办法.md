    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Cotton has begun to fluff in all cotton-producing areas across the country. Coarse cotton areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Sichuan, and other provinces are harvesting, and cotton picking has begun in some cotton areas in Northwest and North China.
    Currently, in the cotton areas of the Yangtze River basin, cotton is growing vigorously in Jiangsu, Hunan, and the central and eastern parts of Hubei, with yields expected to be higher than last year. The average yield in Jiangxi and Zhejiang is expected to remain at last year's level. In Mianyang, Sichuan, cotton began to fluff in mid-August. The autumn rainfall has been less and insect pests lighter than last year in the above areas, and cotton boll opening and fluffing are earlier than last year, so this year's cotton quality is also better than last year, generally with a clean white color and pure texture, and the number of stiff petals and yellow flowers has been greatly reduced compared to last year. In the Northwest region, cotton sowing was more timely than in previous years, with even rainfall in the early stage, coupled with improved cultivation techniques and farmers' continuous victories over insect plagues and droughts, generally cotton growth is good, with more boll setting than in previous years. The region's cotton output is estimated to increase by more than 20% compared to last year, and the quality of cotton has also improved compared to last year. Currently, flower picking is starting in Guanzhong, Shaanxi. In the Jinghui Irrigation Area, winter irrigation and early spring irrigation have been carried out, and cultivation is better, so 419,000 mu of irrigated cotton fields have been able to avoid the trend of reduced production due to drought this year. Farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province have harvested the first batch of cotton. Generally, each mu of cotton field in the province can harvest more than 100 jin of seed cotton. The cotton produced by the Xinjiang Military Region units averages about 150 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of 50% over last year. In the cotton fields of Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Northeast and other places, due to continuous rain in July and August, low temperatures, and little sunshine, coupled with floods in some areas, the phenomenon of boll dropping and boll rot is more serious, and the maturity period is also delayed. The average yield per unit area of cotton fields in Shanxi and Henan provinces can maintain last year's level, while Hebei and Shandong will be lower than last year. Since mid-August, the cotton-growing areas in the Northeast have been sunny and the temperature has risen, so the late growth of cotton is still good, and the output is estimated to be higher than last year.
    After grasping the above situation, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government sent people to hold discussions with the staff of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute and the farmers of Xiaojie Village, Xiaogaozhuang, and Sihezhuang in Tong County, summed up past experience and conducted on-site trials in cotton fields. They believed that continuing to implement methods such as pruning, pushing plants together and ridging to expose the soil to the sun, hoeing the soil, and postponing autumn plowing of cotton fields can promote early maturity of cotton and strive for increased harvests. The Central Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a circular to various places for this purpose. The circular requires all localities to continue to carry out pruning work such as removing large leaves from the main stem, pinching off the tips of fruit branches, and removing runaway shoots and tender buds. Regarding pushing plants together and ridging and hoeing, the circular said that in cotton fields with lush growth and damp soil, cotton plants can be pushed to the left and right every other ridge, so that the two rows of cotton plants grow slightly skewed to the left and right, widening the gaps between cotton rows and strengthening the effect of ventilation and light transmission; from White Dew to around the Autumn Equinox, hoeing should be carried out in the cotton fields to loosen the topsoil and increase the soil temperature, which can not only promote boll opening and improve cotton quality, but also be conducive to autumn plowing. The circular also pointed out that according to the experience of farmers in Xiaojie Village and Xiaogaozhuang in Tong County, general cotton field autumn plowing can be carried out around the Beginning of Winter, and at the latest can be plowed until Minor Snow, so that cotton stalks will not be pulled out early to rush autumn plowing, affecting cotton production. After the cotton stalks are pulled out of the cotton fields on the Beginning of Winter, they should be plowed and harrowed once with a plow without a mirror, so that the topsoil is loose, and even if the initial stage of freezing is delayed, plowing can be carried out, and the effect of moisture preservation can be achieved. The circular also pointed out that after on-site trials in Tong County and other places, pushing cotton plants and hoeing are not difficult tasks. Farmers in Xiaojie Village, Tong County, believe that carrying out a hoeing now can allow for one more picking of good white cotton before the Cold Dew festival.

### 全国各产棉区开始收摘棉花  中央农业部提出争取棉花多收的办法

    全国各产棉区开始收摘棉花
    中央农业部提出争取棉花多收的办法
    【本报讯】全国各产棉区棉花已经吐絮。江苏、浙江、湖北、四川等省的粗绒棉区正在收获，西北和华北部分棉区已经开始收摘棉花。
    目前，在长江流域各棉区，江苏、湖南及湖北的中部和东部一带，棉花生长旺盛，产量可高于去年。江西、浙江平均产量可维持去年水平。四川绵阳棉花在八月中旬已开始吐絮。以上各地今年秋雨少，虫害较轻，棉花结铃吐絮都早于去年，所以今年的棉花品质也比去年好，一般色泽洁白，质地纯净，僵瓣黄花比去年减少了很多。在西北区，今年棉花播种较往年适时，前期雨水调匀，再加耕作技术的改进，和农民连续战胜了虫灾及旱灾，一般棉花生长良好，结铃比往年多，全区棉花产量估计能比去年增产二成以上，棉花的质量也比去年提高。现在，陕西关中正在开始收花，泾惠灌溉区由于进行了冬灌及提早春灌，耕作较好，四十一万九千亩受灌溉的棉田得以避免了今年因天旱减产的趋势。新疆省各族农民已收摘头喷棉花，全省一般棉田每亩都可收籽棉一百斤以上。全新疆军区部队生产的棉花，平均每亩可产籽棉一百五十斤左右，比去年增产百分之五十。河北、山西、河南、山东、东北等地的棉田，由于七、八月间霪雨连绵，气温低、日照少，加以部分地区遭受水灾，所以落铃烂铃的现象较为严重，成熟期也推迟。山西、河南两省棉田的平均单位面积产量可维持去年水平，河北、山东将低于去年。东北棉区自八月中旬后，连日放晴，气温增高，棉花后期生育还好，估计产量可高于去年。
    中央人民政府农业部掌握以上情况后，曾派人分别和华北农业科学研究所职工及通县小街村、小高庄、四合庄等村农民座谈，总结过去经验并在棉田实地试行，认为继续实行整枝、推株并垅晒地、锄地、推迟棉田秋耕等办法，可以促进棉花早熟，争取多收。中央农业部最近并为此向各地发出了通报。通报中要求各地继续进行去主干上的大叶、搯果枝尖、打疯?嫩芽等整枝工作。关于推株并垅、锄地，通报中说，生长茂盛、土地阴湿的棉田，可每隔一垅把棉株向左右推拥，使两行棉株微向左右偏斜生长，增宽棉行空隙，加强通风透光的效能；白露至秋分前后，棉田进行一次锄耪，使表土疏松，提高地温，不但能促进开絮，提高棉花品质，还有利于秋耕。通报中并指出：根据通县小街村和小高庄农民的经验，一般棉田秋耕可在立冬节前后进行，最晚能耕到小雪，这就不致为了赶秋耕而早拔棉秸，影响棉花产量。棉田于立冬节拔秸后即用不带镜的犁耠串，并耱盖一遍，这样，表土疏松，迟到封冻初期也能耕翻，并能收到保墒的作用。通报中并指出：经在通县等地实地试行的结果，推拥棉株和进行锄耪都不是困难的工作。通县小街村的农民认为现在进行一次锄耪，到寒露节前可多摘一次好白花。
