Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Red sorghum, corn, millet and other miscellaneous grains in East China are entering the market one after another. The new grain is generally of good quality and the kernels are full. Grain departments and cooperatives in various places have promptly launched purchasing work. Commercial departments and cooperatives are stepping up preparations to supply farmers with production and living materials.

    In order to encourage grain production, the state-owned company's purchasing prices for miscellaneous grains this year have been appropriately increased compared with the same period last year. Coupled with the reduction in industrial product prices, the actual income of farmers in miscellaneous grain crop areas from selling new grain has been greatly improved, and farmers are generally satisfied. For example, in Bengbu, Anhui Province, an important miscellaneous grain producing area, the state-owned company's red sorghum purchasing price was 500 yuan per jin at this time last year, while this year it is 630 yuan. Judging from the prices of local industrial products, last year at this time, "Dragon Head" white fine cloth was 2,950 yuan per chi, while this year it is 2,850 yuan. Last year at this time, No. 2 kerosene was 5,200 yuan per jin, while this year it is 4,500 yuan. This means that local farmers can buy more than 5 chi of white cloth if they sell 100 jin of red sorghum this year than last year. If they buy kerosene, they can buy more than 4 jin more than last year. Now, farmers in miscellaneous grain areas are drying and winnowing the newly harvested grain before selling it to state-owned companies and cooperatives.

    In order to welcome a large amount of new grain into warehouses and to facilitate farmers' grain sales and deliveries as much as possible, grain departments throughout the region are accelerating the construction of new warehouses capable of holding 120,000 jin of grain. In order to better implement the state's price policy and ensure that farmers can get reasonable returns from selling grain, inspectors from cooperatives and grain departments in various places are holding meetings to exchange experience in grain grading, so as to improve the grading level of inspectors. Recently, cadres of grain departments in many areas of East China have criticized the complacency caused by the completion of wheat purchasing tasks, and have determined that purchasing autumn grain is the current central task.

    In the past month, commercial departments and cooperatives in various parts of East China have held various commodity exhibitions, exchanged information on product production, and continuously dispatched investigation teams and visiting groups to the countryside to investigate the growth of autumn crops, rural market conditions, and farmers' needs for materials. Based on the results of the investigation, commercial departments in various provinces and cities have expanded the supply plan for the third quarter, increased the variety of goods managed, and paid attention to opening up local sources of goods when expanding the supply plan, so as to more fully meet the various needs of farmers selling autumn grain. At present, transportation departments in various places are stepping up the transportation of large quantities of industrial products to rural areas. In order to complete the greater transportation tasks of industrial products and agricultural products, more than 10,000 wooden sailboats in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, known for their water network areas, are being rushed to repair, and will soon be fully loaded with industrial products and agricultural products to supply the needs of the vast rural areas and cities.

    华东秋粮陆续上市收购工作已及时展开
    商业部门和合作社加紧准备供应农民需要的物资
    据新华社讯：华东区红粮、玉米、谷子等杂粮正陆续上市。新粮一般质量良好，颗粒饱满。各地粮食部门和合作社已及时地开展了收购工作。商业部门和合作社正加紧准备供应农民生产物资和生活物资。
    为了鼓励粮食生产，今年国营公司杂粮收购牌价已较去年同期作了适当的提高，加以工业品价格的降低，杂粮作物区农民在出售新粮中的实际所得，是大大提高了，农民们普遍感到满意。如安徽省的重要杂粮产地市场蚌埠，去年这时国营公司红粮收购牌价是每斤五百元，今年则是六百三十元。倘就当地工业品的价格看，去年这时龙头白细布每尺二千九百五十元，今年是二千八百五十元。去年这时二号煤油每斤五千二百元，今年是四千五百元。这就是说当地农民今年卖出一百斤红粮，如果买白布，可以比去年多买五尺多。如果买煤油，可以比去年多买四斤多。现在杂粮区的农民，正在把收获的新粮，晒干扬净后，向国营公司和合作社出售。
    为了迎接大量新粮入仓和尽可能照顾农民售粮、交粮的方便，全区粮食部门正加速建筑可容纳十二万斤粮食的新仓库。为了更好的贯彻国家的价格政策，保证农民售粮能得到合理收益，各地合作社和粮食部门的验货人员正普遍举行交流验级经验会议，提高验级人员的验级水平。最近华东不少地区粮食部门的干部都批判了因完成小麦收购任务而产生的麻痹思想，并确定收购秋粮为当前的中心工作。
    华东各地商业部门和合作社近一个月来，举办了各种商品展览会，交流产品生产情况，并不断派遣调查团、访问组下乡，调查秋季作物生长情况、农村市场情况和农民对物资的需要情况。根据调查的结果，各省市商业部门都扩大了第三季度的供应计划，增加了经营品种，并在扩大供应计划时，注意开辟了地方货源，以保证更充分地满足出售秋粮的农民的各种需要。目前，各地交通运输部门正加紧把大批工业品运往农村。为了完成更大的工业品和农产品的运输任务，以水网地带著称的江苏、浙江两地，有一万多艘木帆船正在赶修，不久就将满载着工业品和农产品供应广大农村和城市的需要。
