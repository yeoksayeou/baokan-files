Xinhua News Agency: East China first-level organs and the CPC committees of East China provinces and municipalities are currently taking swift and effective measures to increase production and conserve expenditure to ensure the fulfillment and over-fulfillment of this year’s national construction plan. In recent days, East China first-level organs, enterprise departments, and provincial and municipal party committees have convened various specialized meetings to study the issues of increasing production and practicing economy. Regarding increasing production, the state-owned enterprise departments have already formulated plans for increasing production and expanding operations. The Shanghai factories under the East China Textile Administration, after studying and analyzing various conditions, decided to increase production by 320 billion yuan in the fourth quarter of this year. The Shanghai factories under the East China Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry of the Central People's Government can increase production by more than 160 billion yuan throughout the year. The East China Electric Power Administration and its affiliated factories can increase production by 100 billion yuan throughout the year. The Shanghai Iron and Steel Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government can increase production by more than 90 billion yuan this year. The Shanghai State-owned Commercial Department has also greatly expanded its operating plan according to the needs of the people. Regarding saving expenditure, various regions have checked the implementation of various budgets in the first half of the year and meticulously formulated current plans for saving expenditure. During this review of budget implementation, various regions believed that there were many unreasonable aspects in the past use of certain operating expenses, which should be appropriately reduced; some constructions that are not urgently needed can be postponed. According to preliminary statistics, the amount of expenditure saved in various regions accounts for about 5% to 7% of the total annual budget of various regions. For example, the Shanghai municipal organs can reduce operating expenses by 160 billion yuan, which accounts for 7% of the city's total annual budget. Fujian Province originally requested an additional budget of 40 billion yuan from the central government for the construction of old liberated areas. Now, in addition to resolving this expense through self-adjustment, it will also save 50 billion yuan from operating expenses. When discussing practicing thrift and tightening expenditure, various regions unanimously emphasized that it is necessary to resolutely cut those miscellaneous projects and concentrate efforts on major construction undertakings. Therefore, while tightening expenditure, various regions are concentrating their efforts to complete those major construction undertakings with the greatest effort. Now, various regions are about to enter the stage of mobilizing the masses to discuss plans. A broad and in-depth mass-based production increase and economy drive will soon be launched throughout the region.

    华东一级机关、各企业和各省市党委
    采取有效措施增加生产节约开支
    【新华社讯】华东一级机关和中共华东各省市党委目前正采取迅速而有效的措施，增加生产，节约开支，保证完成和超额完成今年的国家建设计划。连日来，华东一级机关、各企业部门和各省市党委召开了各种专门会议，研究增产节约问题。在增加生产方面，目前国营企业部门已经制订出增加生产和扩大经营的计划。华东纺织管理局所属上海各厂，在研究和分析了各方面的条件后，决定在今年第四季度内增产三千二百亿元。中央人民政府第一机械工业部华东办事处所属上海各厂，全年可增产一千六百多亿元。华东电业管理局及所属各厂全年可增产一千亿元。中央人民政府重工业部上海钢铁公司今年可增产九百多亿元。上海国营商业部门根据人民的需要也大大扩大了经营计划。在节约开支方面，各地检查了上半年各项预算的执行情况，精打细算地编制了当前节约开支的方案。在这次检查预算的执行情况中，各地认为过去某些事业费的使用存有许多不合理的地方，应该适当缩减；一些不急需办的建设可以缓办。据初步统计，各地节约开支的数字约占各地全年总预算的百分之五到百分之七。如上海市各机关可紧缩事业费开支一千六百亿元，这一数字占该市全年总预算的百分之七。福建省原来向中央追加老解放区建设经费预算四百亿元，现除这项费用自行调剂解决外，还将从事业费中节约五百亿元。各地在讨论厉行节约、紧缩开支时，一致强调：必须坚决削减那些杂七杂八的项目，集中力量于主要的建设事业。因此，各地在紧缩开支的同时，正集中力量以最大努力来完成那些主要的建设事业。现在，各地即将进入发动群众讨论计划的阶段，一个广泛而深入的群众性的增产节约竞赛，不久就可在全区展开。
