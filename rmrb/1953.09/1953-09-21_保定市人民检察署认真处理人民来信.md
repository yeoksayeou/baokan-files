    Baoding Municipal People's Procuratorate Earnestly Handles People's Letters
    Reader Wei Zizhen writes: I am a staff member of the Northwest State-owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, and my hometown is in Boye County, Hebei. In August 1951, my younger brother, Wei Zizhai, was summoned and detained by the Baoding municipal judicial authorities for some matter. At this time, local ruffians and gangsters, Fang Xianying, Liu Yunzhou, and others took the opportunity to exploit the backward thinking of my mother and sister-in-law to carry out fraud. They said: the director of the Public Security Bureau in Baoding is a good friend of theirs, and as long as our family is willing to spend some money, big problems can be turned into small ones, and small problems into nothing. In this way, they swindled more than seven million yuan in more than three months, causing my family to sell land and houses, accumulate a lot of debt, and often not have enough to eat. In the end, Fang Xianying and others even threatened my family not to tell anyone about this. This April, when I learned of this incident, I wrote a letter of accusation to the Baoding Municipal People's Procuratorate. At that time, although I did not fully understand the whole process of this fraud case, or even the names and addresses of the fraudsters, the Baoding Municipal Procuratorate, valuing the people's letters, sent five cadres to investigate in all directions, finally clarifying this fraud case.
    This July, I passed through Baoding on business, so I went to the Baoding Municipal People's Procuratorate. It was noon on a Sunday, and Comrade Liu Changji, the Procurator-General, received me. After he told me about the investigation process and handling of this case, he also said: "We should thank you. Because through your letter, not only was your family's problem solved, but also lawless and disciplined elements were dealt with, strengthening the connection between the People's Government and the people." This matter deeply moved me, and I am determined to work hard to repay the Party and the People's Government for their warm care for the people.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    保定市人民检察署认真处理人民来信
    读者魏子贞来信：我是西北国营第二棉纺织厂的工作人员，老家在河北博野县。一九五一年八月间，我弟弟魏子斋因事被保定市司法机关传讯、拘留。这时，当地的地痞流氓房显英、刘云周等便乘机利用我母亲和弟媳的落后思想进行诈骗。他们说：保定市的公安局长是他们的好朋友，只要我家肯出几个钱，就可以大事化小，小事化无。这样，他们在三个多月内共骗走了七百多万元，弄得我家里卖地卖房，欠了多少债，时常揭不开锅。最后房显英等还威胁我家里不许将这事告诉任何人。今年四月，我知道了这一事件，就给保定市人民检察署写了一封检举信。当时虽然我对这件骗案的整个过程甚至骗子的名字、住址不大明白，但由于保定市检察署重视人民来信，派了五个干部四出调查，终于把这件诈骗案调查清楚。
    今年七月间，我因事路经保定，即到保定市人民检察署去了一趟。这是一个星期日的中午，检察长刘昌吉同志接待了我。当他把这个案件的调查过程及处理情况告诉我以后，又说：“我们应该感谢你。因为通过你这一封信不仅解决了你家里的问题，而且还处理了违法乱纪的坏分子，加强了人民政府与人民群众的联系。”这件事使我深深受到感动，我决心努力工作，来回答党和人民政府对人民群众的热情关怀。
