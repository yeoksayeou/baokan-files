    Yuyao County Grain Purchasing Stations
    Frequently Exchange Inspection Techniques
    Under the unified leadership of the Yuyao County Grain Purchasing Office, the forty-three rice purchasing stations in Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, regularly hold meetings for grain inspectors and technical exchange meetings. This constantly improves the inspection techniques of the inspectors, enabling the early rice purchasing work to implement the pricing policy of "superior grade, superior price; lower grade, lower price."
    The Yuyao County Grain Purchasing Office, based on factors such as the distance between purchasing stations and the skill level of the grain inspectors, divided all purchasing stations into five groups, designating inspectors with better skills, higher political awareness, and prestige among the masses as group leaders. Heads-up meetings are held every three days at the level of each grassroots cooperative, with the participation of grain inspectors from the purchasing stations affiliated with each cooperative. The content of the meetings is to exchange samples, unify grading standards, and conduct criticism and self-criticism. These meetings are generally held during evening free time. Technical exchange meetings are held every five days by the above five groups, with the participation of grain inspectors from the purchasing stations in each group. The technical exchange meetings broadly exchange experience in grain inspection, study methods for improving work, and solve difficulties in grain inspection.
    Since the implementation of the grain inspection technical exchange system, the skills of the grain inspectors in Yuyao County have improved. For example, at the beginning of the early rice purchasing season, the grain inspectors at the purchasing stations affiliated with Zhouxing, Langxia, and Simen cooperatives could not clearly distinguish between fire-damaged rice and early rice with thin, soft stalks. Because the prices of the two were different, this affected the implementation of the pricing policy. At the technical exchange meeting, the grain inspectors from these purchasing stations researched and compared the shape and color of the two types of rice, discovering the differences between them. Since then, when evaluating the prices of these two types of rice, the purchasing stations have been basically able to accurately assess them.
    After the grain inspection techniques were improved, the grain inspectors dared to make bold evaluations during grain inspection, overcoming the past phenomena of being afraid of suffering losses, losing money, and being criticized by superiors, and thus making overly strict evaluations. For example, Zhang Jian, a grain inspector at the Yuntang purchasing station, was unsure of himself when inspecting grain before attending the technical exchange meeting. Although the local regulations stipulated that the moisture content standard for rice was 14%, the standard he accepted was 12.4%, which put the peasants at a disadvantage. After attending the technical exchange meeting, he corrected this shortcoming the next day.
    The Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative Federation has issued a circular requesting affiliated cooperatives to learn from Yuyao County's experience in improving grading and evaluation work, and to study and promote it based on local conditions.

### 馀姚县各稻谷收购站  经常交流验货技术

    馀姚县各稻谷收购站
    经常交流验货技术
    浙江省馀姚县四十三个稻谷收购站，在县粮食收购办公室的统一领导下，定期举行验货人员碰头会和技术交流会，不断提高验货人员的验货技术，使早稻收购工作贯彻了“优级优价、低级低价”的价格政策。
    馀姚县粮食收购办公室根据各收购站距离远近、验谷人员水平高低等条件，将所有的收购站编成五个小组；指定技术较好、政治觉悟较高，并在群众中有威信的验货人员为小组长。碰头会以各个基层合作社为单位召开，三天召开一次，由各个合作社所属收购站的验货人员参加。会议的内容是交换样品，统一验级标准，开展批评与自我批评。这种会一般都利用晚上空闲时间召开。技术交流会，由上述五个组分别以组为单位召开，五天开一次，由各组收购站的验货人员参加。技术交流会比较广泛地交流验货经验，研究改进工作的办法，解决验货中的困难。
    馀姚县各收购站自实行验货技术交流制度以来，验货人员的技术提高了。如开始收购早稻时，周行、朗霞、泗门等合作社所属各收购站的验货人员对火稻谷和细秆软稍的早稻不能明确区分，由于两者价格不同，就影响了价格政策的贯彻。在技术交流会上，这几个收购站的验货人员对这两种稻谷的形状、颜色等进行了研究比较，发现两者之间的区别。此后，各收购站在评这两种稻谷的价格时，就基本上能评准确了。
    验货技术提高后，验货人员在验货时便敢于大胆评价，克服了过去怕吃亏、怕赔钱、怕上级批评，因而评价偏紧的现象。如云塘收购站验货员章坚在没有参加技术交流会以前，验货时心中无数。本来当地规定稻谷含水标准是百分之十四，但他收进来的标准却是百分之十二点四，使农民吃了亏。开过技术交流会以后，第二天他就纠正了这一缺点。
    浙江省合作社联合社曾发出通报，要求所属合作社学习馀姚县改进验级评价工作的经验，根据当地具体情况研究推广。
