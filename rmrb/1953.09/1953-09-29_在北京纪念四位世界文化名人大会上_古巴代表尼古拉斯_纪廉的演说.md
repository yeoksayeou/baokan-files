On behalf of the Cuban people, who have traditional ties with the Chinese people, and also on behalf of the Cuban National Committee for the Defense of Peace, I express my utmost enthusiasm and gratitude to the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace for the lofty honor bestowed upon José Martí on the centenary of his birth.

Martí's name is revered not only in Cuba but also in other Latin American countries. He was the soul of our people's armed struggle against Spanish rule.

The historical context of this struggle was a region of only 100,000 square kilometers in the latter half of the nineteenth century. At that time, this region had only three million inhabitants.

The Spanish, at the beginning of their rule in the early sixteenth century, brought in African blacks and made them a constant driving force of the slave system society for nearly four hundred years. Those who first rose up against colonial rule and fought for freedom were these unfortunate black people.

Every bloodstained page of Cuban history is filled with the great deeds of these enslaved or free blacks—the great deeds of people who hoped to win a better life for themselves and the masses to whom they belonged.

Their efforts were not successful. From the time of the first domestic uprising, the Spanish government was able to rely on the help of the local bourgeoisie, whose wealth—mainly in the sugar industry—was based on slave labor. The example of the former French Saint-Domingue in the early nineteenth century—which first established the Haitian Empire and later formed a republic where black people controlled their own destiny—made the Cuban exploiting classes afraid for many years to hope for an uprising, because they feared that the bloody tragedy that had occurred on the neighboring island would be repeated.

It was not until 1868, when the Cuban exploiting class attempted to reach an agreement with the suzerain state and become a member of the United States of America and failed, that the Spanish government encountered the first serious armed movement. This was the first important uprising that occurred when the highest stratum of society in a colony strongly felt the need for autonomy.

On October 10 of that year, the people who revolted against Spain were not the general populace or the petty bourgeoisie, but the dignitaries among the local whites, nobles with titles, or people related to the court. They were all owners of slaves and huge sugar and livestock industries. They were millionaires, lawyers, writers, and the leisure class. This uprising continued for ten years until the victorious Spain and the conquered Cuba signed a peace treaty, which stopped it. During these ten years, the property of the Cuban bourgeoisie was lost, their representatives were either killed or exiled, and, in short, they lost their leadership in the country.

On the other hand, those African slaves who were released by the slave owners at the beginning of the armed struggle began their lives as citizens in the battle, which was not for their freedom but for the independence of the country with which they had an inseparable connection. This battle, carried out in fire and blood, was their civic school. In the battle, they learned to live with their former masters, to share weal and woe with them, and they believed that as long as Cuba was free, they could also gain freedom. The petty bourgeoisie occupied the position abandoned by the defeated upper class, along with a black petty bourgeoisie with less cultural and economic power, but some important military and literary figures emerged during that revolutionary stage. The entire period from 1878 (when the Ten Years' War ended) to 1895 was a period of renewed uprisings against colonial rule. This period was decisive for the emergence of Cuban nationalism, the appearance of its most outstanding leaders, and the division of the country into revolutionaries and reformists, that is, those who tried to compromise with Spain and those who rose up to fight it with arms.

The war of 1895, the second war, was José Martí's war. In 1868, when the nobles led the movement we just mentioned, Martí was only fifteen years old (he was born on January 28, 1853, exactly one hundred years ago). He belonged to the petty bourgeoisie. His father, Mariano, was a poor man from Valencia, Spain, barely a colonial employee. His mother, Leonor Pérez, was from Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the Canary Islands, a woman of humble origins. Such huge branches, a great personality, grew out of such a fragile trunk. At the age of sixteen, Martí was sentenced to forced labor because of his love for the motherland, and at the age of eighteen, due to the same patriotic activities, he was forced to leave his homeland and was exiled to Spain. He sacrificed his life at the age of forty-two, at the most mature period of his creative power. He was a poet, orator, writer, politician, revolutionary agitator, etc. Tonight, let us look at José Martí appropriately with the eyes of his time and also with modern eyes—although due to the brevity of my speech, I cannot give a full account—, because the work that he could not complete due to his death is still the task of our Cuban people.

What kind of revolution did Martí call for against the Spanish government? He called for a people's revolution, led by the middle class, guided by the methods of the petty bourgeoisie, and guided by the political and economic ideas of the petty bourgeoisie. After the Cuban big bourgeoisie's long, bloody, and ineffective activities aimed at defeating Spain failed, the people continued the struggle seventeen years later. The remaining bourgeoisie dissolved after compromising with Spain, a compromise that sought a "comfortable freedom," autonomy within the colonial scope—a phenomenon that arose simultaneously with the revolutionary struggle in the late nineteenth century. In addition, they later adopted a policy of approaching and surrendering to North American imperialism, which began in the early twentieth century and continues shamefully to this day.

Martí was the sharpest expression of his time, and he represented his historical era. This does not diminish him in the eyes of a fair observer, but makes him even greater. Due to the greatness of his ideals, he was not only a great poet, but also an activist who could turn dreams into reality. In the letters, speeches, and articles of this multifaceted great man, we can see many chapters that show Martí's struggle to resist enemies and solve various problems faced by the revolutionary ideals during a period when social classes (the basis of the new conflict between Cuba and Spain) were becoming increasingly complex.

We can see him, we can feel his enthusiasm, sometimes as a diplomat, sometimes as an authoritative leader, gentle and strong, resilient, sometimes like an eagle, sometimes like a dove—guiding revolutionaries, mediating disputes, solving difficulties, and leading the masses. The people led by Martí were a group of people full of contradictions. On the one hand, there was the racial factor, with whites and blacks not yet united, and blacks still hating slavery. On the other hand, there were social factors. The embryonic proletariat did not fully understand the thoughts of their most brilliant leader, the idea of class struggle. The selfishness of the people who were disappointed after the first failure and their fear that new outbreaks would damage their interests caused various obstacles to revolutionary propaganda activities. Martí overcame all difficulties. He rose up against them and made himself the leader of a class whose mission was to separate Cuba from Spain. Due to the thought of this struggle and the urgency of the task, Martí became an unparalleled spiritual force, which also somewhat obscured his talents as a poet and writer.

In order to win people over to support his separatist ideas, he had to fight on two fronts. On the one hand, he opposed the old ideas of merging Cuba into the United States of America, and on the other hand, he opposed those who advocated Cuban autonomy within the scope of colonial rule and considered this a progressive and appropriate solution—or as they said, an "evolutionary" solution. He wrote from New York: "Only those who do not understand our country can come up with such a shameful solution." The beautiful but backward building in North America had cooled his initial enthusiasm. At first, he had called Lincoln's country the land of freedom. He had realized that for the United States, Cuba was just a "property that could be spent. Its only disadvantage is its people, who are a weak and despised Latin race."

Martí said to those who advocated making Cuba an autonomous territory under Spanish rule before the uprising in Cuba: "If they do not take refuge in Latin American countries—where they speak a language and work together—they will be exiled and executed. Others, if they wish, can go to Madrid to be free princes or imperial favorites."

What about the blacks? What about the fear of blacks? We have said that the Cuban bourgeoisie did not dare to promote the resistance movement against the colonialists because they feared these descendants of slaves. When Martí put forward his new program of uprising, the Spanish government and those who opposed armed struggle used the old tricks to intimidate the white people who wanted to revolt. At that time, Martí wrote: "A person is first a person, and then a white or black person." His work was to unite all Cuban people, regardless of their skin color, and to fundamentally look at them. He said, "It is human to study the root of things."

Due to his origin and lack of socialist education, it is unfair and impossible to ask Martí to have the concept of class struggle. But in his time and place—when Cuba was a colony without a formed and conscious working class—he was indeed a radical revolutionary. The solutions he proposed showed his profound wisdom and political understanding: distributing land in a thorough feudal society, speaking of racial equality in a society that had not yet eliminated slavery; replacing traditional aristocratic rule with the rule of the people; exposing the face of imperialism when its shadow had just appeared on the horizon; expelling 300,000 Spaniards who were rampant in the country; and advocating armed revolution and the liberation of Cuba when all the Cuban ruling classes were filled with pessimism.

Martí died when the revolution he pointed out the way for encountered difficulties, but even if he had lived and seen the end of this bloody armed struggle, which was the same as in other parts of the Americas, he would not have rested until his political ideals were realized. Therefore, his image will always be with us, among the Cuban people who are following in his footsteps—this great man, with his brilliant thoughts, not only illuminates the country where he was born, but also illuminates the entire continent to which this country belongs.

Let us look at the current situation in Cuba in terms of the problems pointed out and attempted to be solved by Martí: the land has not yet been distributed and is still in the hands of a small number of domestic landlords and American sugar bosses.

Cuban blacks are not allowed to do many kinds of work simply because of their black skin. In so-called "white" societies, blacks are not allowed to enter, and in black societies, whites are not allowed to enter. Although the Cuban constitution prohibits any racial discrimination, there are no laws stipulating penalties for violating this principle.

The people are not in power; they have always been deceived by traditional politicians, their electoral will has been distorted, and they have been deceived by military rebellions and dictators—such as today's Batista dictatorship, all of which violate the spirit of Martí.

The power of North American imperialism extends in many ways into Cuba's economic, political, and social life. Every attempt to establish a national industry is strangled by it; it monopolizes the planting of sugarcane and controls its market; it makes bourgeois politicians corrupt tools of American capitalism; it provokes discrimination against blacks, prohibiting them from working in the industries opened in this country; and it despises local people of any color.

Although there are various symbols on the surface: the national anthem, the national emblem, the national flag, and the division of national power, Cuban independence does not actually exist. This is because after the disappearance of Spanish colonial rule, American imperialism took its place.

In fact, Martí's revolution ended in 1898 when American troops intervened in the Spanish-Cuban War. The Treaty of Paris, which ended this war, was signed by representatives from Madrid and Washington, not Havana. After the war stopped, General Shafter's American troops refused to recognize the heroic Cuban army of General Calixto García, who had taken on most of the war after the death of General Maceo. The republic that they then called "freedom and independence" had to wait four years (1902) to be produced. During this period, Cuba was governed by a dictatorial government composed of foreign military leaders, who left Cuba after promulgating the constitution, but the Platt Amendment to the constitution (now repealed) gave the great neighbor the terrible right to militarily intervene in a small country, a right they have used twice.

Martí's ideals continue today in Cuba and the United States. His struggle, the struggle of 1895, awaits people to continue in 1953, a struggle that was suddenly interrupted by a power irrelevant to the interests of the struggle. The danger that Martí saw half a century ago is the violence that strangles our necks today. We look at Columbus's map, and all we see is a country harnessed to the chariot driven by Washington. Didn't Martí foresee this? He almost saw this concrete reality, although some unbelievers thought it was impossible.

When the International Conference was held in Washington in December 1889, Martí warned us that this invitation meant unequal economic exchange. He talked about American independence, saying: "Such a powerful America, full of unsaleable goods, an America determined to expand its power in the Americas, is now inviting the weaker countries in the Americas to form an alliance with it against the European countries and sever all trade relations with other countries in the world. These American countries originally carried out free and beneficial trade with European countries. ——Nothing makes me more angry, makes me feel more vigilant, and makes me need to study more carefully than this matter. Spanish America has already known how to save itself under the tyrannical rule of Spain, and now, with wise eyes, looking at the long-term and short-term causes of the American invitation, it must be said: it is already time for Spanish America to declare its second independence." In the earlier part of the same document, he summarized his thoughts with the greatest emphasis: He said, "It is still too late and there is no need to take any risks to make a unanimous and firm response. Only such a response can liberate the people of Spanish America and save them from hopeless anxiety and confusion during their development. Otherwise, under the hegemonic policy of a powerful neighbor, they will only be in this situation forever. This powerful neighbor only hinders their development, such as in Panama; or plunders their territory, such as in Mexico, Nicaragua, Dominica, Haiti, and Cuba; or uses threats to cut off their relations with other countries, such as in Colombia; or, as he is doing now, forces them to buy what he cannot sell, or plots to rule them..." On this issue, Martí said some more words, as if he were speaking today: "What does it mean for us to join America's war against other countries in the world as its allies in our youth? Do we have to conduct the war between America and Europe on the land of Latin America to let them show us what the colonial system is like?"

Martí, in January 1894, the year before he participated in the revolutionary war—on the eve of another break between Cuba and Spain, called on the Cuban people to rise up against the impending American invasion. The following are a few sentences from an article he published in the "Patria Daily" in New York: "No one will respect those who are not worthy of respect; when we live among such a nation, they traditionally despise us, hate us, mock us in the newspapers, and even their best history books and their best people despise us, regarding us as weak and incompetent, a people that can be defeated with a feather; when we live in such a country, and must live in it, this country, due to its tradition and literature itself, due to its having easily robbed a large piece of land from Mexico, due to its ideas of racial discrimination, due to its arrogant and greedy style that grows with profit and conquest, is absolutely autocratic. Every moment, as long as there is an opportunity and an excuse, it is eager to rise, in order to make those who cannot retreat from their path respect it and pay attention to it. It takes advantage of the fact that the time of the establishment of our republic is too short to show our true face. They envy their own freedom, and if we do not envy our own freedom, they will despise us, they will think we are incompetent; they must be made to see that we are always prepared and vigorous. These people travel around the world, using their fingers to probe the flesh of foreigners everywhere to see if they soften or resist. We must have hard flesh, we must resist the fingers of these foreigners who probe everywhere, we must speak to them in their language, because they do not understand our way of speaking..."

On May 18, 1895, twenty-four hours before he died covered with wounds from Spanish bullets, Martí wrote that famous letter to Manuel Mercado: "I am in danger of death at any time, in danger of dying for my country, for my due obligations—because I know what my obligations are and am willing to fulfill this obligation—that is: to stop the United States from expanding in Latin America after Cuba gains independence, crossing the Antilles. Everything I am doing today, everything I will do, is for this purpose."

On the hundredth anniversary of the birth of this great man, what do we see again in Cuba and the Americas? In Cuba: it is a military dictatorship. People like Juan Marinello, Blas Roca, Joaquín Ordoqui, and Lázaro Peña have all been arrested or persecuted—precisely negating everything Martí hoped our people would obtain. In the United States, it is the oligarchy of imperialism and the threat of a new war—which precisely affirms what Martí worried about for the other peoples on our continent.

Therefore, Martí has a revolutionary persistence in our country. This is where his unparalleled nature lies; it is impossible not to do what he did not finish. Like China before the revolution, we must drive the Americans out of our country and hand the land over to the peasants; make Cuba a country that can go its own way in its own way.

If Martí were still alive, he would certainly celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China, because it represents the victory of your people, and the example of the Chinese people has encouraged and strengthened the struggle of the Cuban people, because it proves that imperialism can be defeated.

Before ending my speech tonight, please allow me to mention a poem full of wisdom, which your great Guo Moruo wrote last year at the closing of a conference where Amado and I talked about our countries Brazil and Cuba. At that time, Guo Moruo said: The present of Latin America is the past of China, and the present of China is the future of Latin America. This is a great and beautiful truth. The spirit of Martí is immortal. He is still fighting with his works to make this future that Guo Moruo said a reality for us, and we are sure that this will be achieved.

### 在北京纪念四位世界文化名人大会上  古巴代表尼古拉斯·纪廉的演说

    在北京纪念四位世界文化名人大会上
    古巴代表尼古拉斯·纪廉的演说
    我代表和中国人民有着传统的联系的古巴人民，同时又代表古巴的全国保卫和平委员会，以无比的热情感谢中国人民与中国人民保卫世界和平委员会在何塞·马蒂诞生一百周年之际所给与他的崇高的荣誉。
    马蒂的名字不仅在古巴受到敬爱，而且在拉丁美洲其他国家也受到爱戴。他是我国人民反对西班牙统治的武装斗争的灵魂。
    这个斗争的历史背景是十九世纪后半期的一个仅占十万平方公里的地区。那时这地区仅有三百万居民。
    西班牙人在他们的统治开始时，即十六世纪初，就运来了非洲黑人，并使他们成为近四百年来的奴隶制社会的不断的推动力量，而首先起来反抗殖民统治，为自由而斗争的，就是这些不幸的黑人。
    每一页血迹斑斑的古巴历史都充满了这种奴隶或自由黑人的伟大事迹——希望为他们自己的和他们所属的群众争取较好的生活的人们的伟大事迹。
    他们的努力都没有成功。西班牙政府从第一次国内起义时开始即能倚赖当地的资产阶级的帮助，这些人的财富——主要是蔗糖业——就是以奴隶劳动为基础的。十九世纪初期前法属圣多明各的例子——即先创立海地帝国，后来成立了黑人自己掌握了命运的共和国——使得古巴的剥削阶级多少年来不敢希望有起义的事情，因为他们惧怕邻岛所发生的流血惨剧会重演。
    直到一八六八年古巴的剥削阶级企图与宗主国达成协议并成为美洲合众国的一员而失败时，西班牙政府才碰到第一次严重的武装运动，这是在一个殖民地的社会最高阶层很强烈的感觉有自治的需要时而发生的第一个重要起义。
    在那一年十月十日反抗西班牙的人们并不是一般的人民大众也不是小资产阶级，而是当地白人中的显贵人物，有着爵位的贵族，或是与朝廷有关系的人，他们都是奴隶和巨大的糖业及牲畜业的所有者，他们是百万富翁、律师、作家，以及有闲阶级。这次起义继续了十年直到胜利的西班牙和被征服了的古巴签订了和约才停止。在这十年中古巴的资产阶级的财产丢掉了，他们的代表人物或是被杀，或是被流放，总而言之他们失掉了在全国的领导地位。
    另一方面，那些在武装斗争开始时被奴隶主释放了的非洲奴隶，在战斗中开始了公民的生活，这战斗还不是为了他们的自由而是为了和他们有着不可分割的联系的国家的独立。这个在火与血中进行的战斗是他们的公民学校，在战斗中他们学习和他们过去的主人一起生活，和他们共患难，他们相信只要古巴自由了他们也就可以得到自由。小资产阶级占据了战败了的上层阶级所放弃了的地位，和他们一起的，是文化与经济力量较小，但在那一革命阶段出现了一些重要的军人和文人的黑人小资产阶级。从一八七八年（十年战争是在一八七八年结束的）到一八九五年整个这一段时期是反对殖民统治的起义重新爆发的时期，这时期对于古巴民族主义的产生，它的最杰出领袖的出现，全国分为革命者与改良主义者，也就是企图和西班牙妥协的人和起来和它作武装斗争的人，是有着决定性的作用的。
    一八九五年的、即第二次的战争是何塞·马蒂的战争。一八六八年当贵族们领导我们刚才讲到的运动时，马蒂还只有十五岁，（他是一八五三年一月二十八日出世的，距今整整一百年）他属于小资产阶级，他的父亲马里安诺，是西班牙瓦棱萨地方的一个穷人，勉强算是殖民地的一个雇员。他的母亲利昂诺拉·佩雷丝，是加那利群岛的圣克鲁兹德坦尼瑞弗的人，她是一个出身微贱的女人。这样巨大的树枝、伟大的人格就是从这样脆弱的树干上生长出来的。在马蒂十六岁时，由于他对祖国的热爱，他被判劳役，十八岁由于同样的爱国活动，他又被迫离开故土被流放到西班牙。四十二岁正当他生命的创造力最成熟的时期，他牺牲了生命。他是诗人，演讲家，作家，政治家，革命鼓动者等等。今晚让我们用他的时代的眼光同时也用现代的眼光来适当地看何塞·马蒂——尽管由于我的演说很简短而不能作充分的叙述——，因为由于他的死而使他不能完成的那件工作仍然是我们古巴人民的任务。
    马蒂号召向西班牙政府进行的是什么样的革命呢？他号召的是人民革命，由中产阶级领导、用小资产阶级的办法、用小资产阶级的政治及经济思想指导的革命。在古巴大资产阶级的以打败西班牙为目的的长期的、流血的无效的活动失败后，人民在十七年后又继续斗争。所留无几的资产阶级在和西班牙妥协后解散了，这妥协是一种寻求“舒服的自由”的在殖民地范围内的自治，——这是十九世纪末叶和革命斗争同时产生的一种现象。另外他们后来又采取了接近并向北美帝国主义屈服的政策，这政策是二十世纪初开始实行的，而且可耻地继续到今天。
    马蒂是他的时代的最尖锐的表现，他代表了他的历史时代。这使他在一个公正的观察者的眼中不但不减色而且使他显得更伟大。由于他理想的伟大，他不仅是一个伟大的诗人，而且是一个能把梦想变为事实的行动家。在这个多方面的伟人的信件、演讲稿和文章中，我们可以看到许多篇章表现了马蒂为了抵抗敌人和解决社会阶层（古巴与西班牙的新冲突的基础）日益复杂时期的革命理想面临的各种问题而进行的斗争。
    我们可以看见他，我们可以感觉到他的热情，有时是一个外交家，有时是一个权威的领袖，温和而坚强、有韧性，有时像鹰，有时像鸽子——指导革命分子，调解争执，解决疑难，领导群众。马蒂所领导的人民是一群充满了矛盾的人群，一方面有种族的因素，白种与黑种人还没有团结，黑人还恨着奴隶制，另一方面有着社会因素。胚胎期的无产阶级还不完全了解他们这最英明的领袖的思想，阶级斗争的思想。第一次失败后感到失望的人们的自私心以及他们惧怕新的爆发会损伤他们的利益的心理使革命宣传活动遭到了各种障碍。马蒂克服了一切困难。他起来反对他们，使自己成为一个以使古巴脱离西班牙为己任的阶级的领袖，由于想到这个斗争，由于任务的迫切，马蒂变成了一支无可比拟的精神的力量，因此这也多少掩盖了他作为诗人和作家的才华。
    为了要争取人们来支持他的分立主义的思想，他不得不在两条战线上作斗争。一方面是反对那些主张把古巴合并到美利坚合众国去的陈旧思想，另一方面，反对那些宣传古巴在殖民统治范围内的自治并认为这是进步的和适当的解决办法——或者如他们所说“进化”的办法——的人们，他从纽约写道：“只有那些不了解我国的人才想得出这样一个可耻的解决办法。”北美洲的那个漂亮但落后的大厦已经使他初到时的热情冷却下来，起初他曾经把林肯的国家称为自由之邦。他已经认识到对于美国说来古巴不过是一笔“可以花一花的财产。它的唯一的不利就是它的人民，他们是弱小而受鄙视的拉丁族”。
    马蒂对那些主张在古巴起义以前在西班牙统治下作一个自治领的人的人们说：“如果他们不在拉丁美洲国家避难——在那里他们说一种语言，一起工作——他们就会被流放、处死，别人要愿意的话，可以到马德里去，去做自由的王公或者做帝王的幸臣。”
    还有黑人呢？对黑人的惧怕怎么样呢？我们已说过，古巴的资产阶级就是因为惧怕这些奴隶的子孙才不敢推动反对殖民者的反抗运动的，当马蒂提出他的新的起义的纲领时，西班牙政府和那些反对武装斗争的人们又使用起旧伎俩来恐吓那些要革命的白种人，那时马蒂写道：“一个人首先是一个人，然后才是白种人或黑种人”，他的工作是团结一切古巴人民，不论他的肤色，而从根本上去看他。他说“研究事物的根本的才是人”。
    由于他的出身，由于没有受过社会主义的教育，因此，要求马蒂有阶级斗争的观念是不公平的，也是不可能的。可是在他的当时当地的条件下，——那时古巴是个殖民地，没有已经形成的、觉悟的工人阶级——他的确是一个激烈的革命者，他提出的解决问题的办法表现了他深刻的智慧和政治认识：在一个彻头彻尾的封建社会里分配土地，在一个还没有消灭奴隶制度的社会里讲种族平等；以人民的统治代替传统的贵族统治；在帝国主义的影子还刚刚在地平线上出现的时候就揭露它的面目；驱逐在国内横行的三十万西班牙人；当所有古巴的统治阶级都充满了悲观情绪时，他提出武装革命和解放古巴的主张。
    马蒂是在他为之指出了道路的革命遭遇困难时死去的，但是即便他活着，看到这个和美洲其他地方一样血腥的武装斗争的结束，他在他的政治理想实现之前也不会休息的。因此他的形象永远在我们，在跟随着他的足迹的古巴人民的中间——这个伟大的人物以他光辉的思想不但照亮了他所诞生的国家，而且照亮了这国家所属的整个大陆。
    让我们就马蒂指出的并试图加以解决的问题看一看古巴现在的情况吧：土地还没有分配，还在一小撮本国地主和美国糖业老板的手中。
    古巴的黑人就因为皮肤黑，而不准做许多种工作。在所谓“白人”的社会中，黑人是不许进去的，在黑人的社会中，白人也不许进去，虽然古巴的宪法是禁止任何种族歧视的，但并没有任何法律规定，违反这一原则的应受惩罚。
    人民并没有当权，他们一直被传统的政客们欺骗着，他们的选举意志被歪曲，他们被军事叛变和独裁者欺骗着——如今天巴蒂斯塔的独裁一样，这一切都是违反马蒂的精神的。
    北美帝国主义的力量多方面伸入古巴的经济、政治和社会生活，每一个要建立民族工业的企图都被它所扼杀；它垄断着甘蔗的种植并控制着它的市场；它使资产阶级的政治家们成为美国资本主义的腐败的工具；它挑拨对黑人的歧视，禁止他们在这个国家开设的工业中工作，它看不起任何颜色的本地人。
    虽然有着外表上的各种象征：国歌，国徽，国旗，以及国家政权的分工，但古巴的独立实际上并不存在。这是因为在西班牙殖民统治消失后，美国帝国主义又取而代之了。
    事实上马蒂的革命在一八九八年当美国军队干涉西古战事时就完了。结束这次战火的巴黎和约，是由马德里和华盛顿而不是哈瓦那的代表来签字的。战事停止后，沙弗特将军的美国军队拒绝承认在马斯奥将军死后担负着大部战事的卡利克斯托·加西亚将军的英勇的古巴军队。而他们那时称之为“自由与独立”的共和国却必须等待四年后（一九○二）才产生，这期间古巴是由外国军事领袖组成的独裁政府执政，他们在公布宪法后才离开古巴，但宪法的普拉特附件（现已废除）给了巨大的邻邦以军事干涉一个小国的可怕的权利，这权利他们已利用了两次。
    马蒂的理想在今天的古巴和美国仍继续着。他的斗争，一八九五年的斗争在一九五三年等待着人们继续下去，这斗争是被一个与斗争利益无关的强权国突然打断的。马蒂在半世纪前即看到的危险就是今天勒着我们头颈的暴力。我们看看哥伦布的地图，举目所瞩尽是套在华盛顿所驱驶的战车上的国家。难道马蒂没有预见到这一点吗？他差不多是看见这个具体的现实，虽然有些不相信的人认为那是不可能的。
    一八八九年十二月国际大会在华盛顿举行时，马蒂曾向我们提出警告说，这邀请意味着不平等的经济交换。他谈到美国的独立说：“这样一个强大的、充满了卖不出去的商品的美国，决心要在美洲扩张势力的美国，现在邀请美洲比较弱的国家来和他结成一个反对欧洲各国的联盟，并断绝和世界其他各国一切贸易关系。而这些美洲国家原来是和欧洲各国进行着自由、有利的贸易的。——没有比这件事更引起我的忿怒，更使我感到需要警惕，更需要仔细研究了。西班牙美洲已经知道如何在西班牙的暴虐统治下拯救自己，而现在用聪明的眼光看看美国这个邀请的远因和近因，就一定得说：已经该是西班牙美洲宣布她第二次独立的时候了。”在同一篇东西的前面部分，他以最大的强调，概括了他的思想：他说：“现在还来得及、而且不必冒什么危险去作出一致的、坚决的回答，只有这样的回答才能使西班牙美洲的人民得到解放，免于在她发展的时期中受到无望的忧虑和混乱。不然，在一个强大的邻人的霸道政策之下，他们就只好永远处于这种境地，这个强邻只是阻挠了他们的发展，例如在巴拿马；或者掠夺了他们的领土，例如在墨西哥、尼加拉瓜、多米尼加、海地和古巴；或者用威胁手段使他们与其他国家割断关系，例如在哥伦比亚；或者如他现在所做的，强迫他们买他卖不出去的东西，或者阴谋统治他们……”就在这个问题上，马蒂又说了一些话，就像是在今天说的一样，他说：“我们在青春时期，作为美国的同盟而加入它对世界其他各国所发动的战争究竟有什么意思呢？我们是否一定要在拉丁美洲的土地上进行美国和欧洲的战争，好让他们给我们看看殖民制度是什么样的呢？”
    马蒂在参加革命战争的前一年——一八九四年一月，在古巴和西班牙又一次破裂的前夕，号召古巴人民起来反抗美国即将进行的侵入，以下是他在纽约出版的“祖国日报”上发表的一篇文章中的几句话：“任何人都不会尊敬那些不配受尊敬的人；当我们生活在这样一个民族当中，他们传统地轻视我们，仇恨我们，在报纸上取笑我们，甚至他们最好的历史书、他们最好的人都轻视我们，把我们看作软弱无能的、一根羽毛就可以打倒的人民；当我们在这样一个国家生活着，而且必须生活下去，这国家由于它的传统和文学的本身，由于它曾经很轻易地抢了墨西哥的一大块土地，由于种族歧视的思想，由于它的与利润和征服一同增长的傲慢贪婪的作风，这国家是绝对专横的，它每时每刻只要有机会、有借口就迫切需要往上升，为的使那些不能退避他们的道路的人们尊敬它、注意它，它利用的是我们共和国成立的时间太短，还来不及表现我们的本来面目。他们妒嫉他们自己的自由，而我们如果不妒嫉我们自己的自由的话，他们就看不起我们，他们认为我们是低能的；一定要使他们看到我们永远是有预备而且生气蓬勃的。这些人周游世界，到处用指头探一探外国人的肉，看他们是软下去的还是反抗。我们必须有硬的肉，必须反抗这些到处乱探的外国人的指头，我们必须用他们的语言来和他们讲话，因为他们是不懂我们的说话方式的……”
    一八九五年五月十八日，在他浑身布满了西班牙子弹的伤痕而死去前的二十四小时，马蒂给曼努埃尔·梅卡多写了那封有名的信：“我随时都有生命危险，有为了我的祖国、为了我应尽的义务而死去的危险——因为我知道我的义务是什么，而且愿意履行这个义务——那就是：及时制止美国在古巴获得了独立之后，越过安的列斯来竭力在拉丁美洲的土地上扩张，我今天所做的一切事，我将要做的一切事，都是为了这个目的”。
    在这位伟大的人物诞辰的一百周年的今天，我们在古巴、在美洲又看到了什么呢？在古巴：是军事独裁、像胡安·马里纳利奥、布拉斯·罗加、豪金·奥多基和拉萨罗·培尼亚这些人都被捕入狱或受到迫害——恰好否定了马蒂希望我国人民所得到的一切。在美国是帝国主义的寡头统治，一次新的战争的威胁——这又恰好是肯定了马蒂为我们大陆上其他人民着想而担心的事。
    因此马蒂在我国有着革命的持久性，这就是他无可比拟的地方，要不去做他未完成的事是不可能的。像中国在革命前一样，我们必须把美国佬赶出我们的国家，把土地交给农民；使古巴成为一个可以以自己的方式走自己的路的国家。
    如果马蒂还活着的话，他一定会庆贺中华人民共和国的诞生，因为它代表着你们人民的胜利，而中国人民的榜样也鼓舞了、加强了古巴人民的斗争，因为这证明了帝国主义是可以打败的。
    在今夜结束讲话以前，请容许我提起一首充满了智慧的诗，那是你们伟大的郭沫若在去年和亚马多和我谈到我们的国家巴西和古巴的一次会议闭幕时作的，当时郭沫若说：拉丁美洲的现在就是中国的过去，中国的现在也就是拉丁美洲的将来。这是伟大而美丽的真理。马蒂的精神不死，他还在以他的作品为了使郭沫若所说的这个将来成为我们的现实而战斗着，我们确信这一定会实现的。
