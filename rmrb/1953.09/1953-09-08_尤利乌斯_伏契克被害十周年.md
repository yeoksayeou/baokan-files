    Julius Fučík's Tenth Anniversary of Death
    Czechoslovakia  Gustá Fučíková

    In these days, the people of Czechoslovakia are commemorating the tenth anniversary of the murder of Julius Fučík, a national hero of Czechoslovakia. He was murdered by the fascist German bandits in Berlin on September 8, 1943.

    Julius Fučík's entire life was spent fighting for the liberation of the working class and the freedom of his country's people against barbaric fascism and war. He fought under the banner of communism and the October Revolution. He entered the battle for a better future. For this ideal, he fought in the ranks of the Communist Party from his youth. He was a revolutionary journalist, literary critic, and a propagandist who inspired the masses. Under the bourgeois rule of Czechoslovakia, Julius Fučík suffered constant persecution. He was imprisoned for months. From 1930 to 1938, he often lived underground.

    When the Soviet Union implemented its first few five-year plans, Julius Fučík lived in the Soviet Union as a journalist. He saw the first socialist construction and the growth of new socialist people. Julius Fučík wrote the most beautiful reports in the Stalingrad region, as if he foresaw that this region of the Soviet state would be recorded in the history of all mankind—the victory over the fascist German bandits in Stalingrad and today's great communist construction.

    In 1942, during the defense of Stalingrad, Julius Fučík had already fallen into the hands of the German fascists. In his book "Report from the Gallows," he himself mentioned that he was arrested on April 24, 1942. He did not succumb even in the terrible, inhuman "Gestapo" prison. His confidence in the collapse of fascism, the victory of the Soviet army, and the liberation of the Czech and Slovak peoples was not shaken in the slightest. Therefore, when the German bandits tried him in Berlin on August 25, 1943, he said to the fascist judges:

    “You are now going to read the verdict to me. I know that this
    verdict is a sentence to death. But I have already prepared
    your verdict, in which is written in the blood of all
    just people in the world: Fascism is dead! The
    slave system of capitalism is dead! Humanity lives forever! The future belongs to communism!”

    On September 8, 1943, the fourteenth day after the sentence was pronounced, Julius Fučík was murdered in Berlin. The verdict that Fučík made against those fascist executioners was carried out very justly by the Soviet army—who liberated hundreds of millions of people, and also liberated the Czech and Slovak peoples from fascist enslavement. The People's Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia began to move towards the road of building a happy life.

    Julius Fučík's life and his heroic struggle for the freedom of his country's people made him a national hero.

    Many mines, industrial enterprises, schools, and Young Pioneer teams are named after Julius Fučík. In them, a new socialist life is growing, the life for which Fučík sacrificed himself.

    In the socialist construction of the People's Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia, Julius Fučík's articles and essays that fought against the reactionaries and reflected the great Soviet Union played a role. These articles have now been collected and published as Julius Fučík's collected works. To date, the published books about the Soviet Union include: "The Country Where Tomorrow Has Become Yesterday" and "In Our Dear Land"; books on literary theory and literary criticism include: "Three Doctrines" and "Collection of Literary Essays"; books on fighting against the occupiers and traitors include: "We Love Our People" and "Report from the Gallows".

    Progressives all over the world love Julius Fučík because he is the embodiment of those heroes who fight forever for the freedom of their country, for peace, and for the happy life of mankind. Therefore, at the Second World Peace Congress held in Warsaw in 1950, he was posthumously awarded the Special Honorary Prize of the International Peace Prize.

    Regarding the life of Julius Fučík, two plays have been written in the Soviet Union, and the Soviet poet Likharev wrote a poem about Julius Fučík, "Hero" (i.e., "The Merit of a Friend"). The great peace poet Pablo Neruda also wrote the poem "To Julius Fučík".

    The book "Report from the Gallows" has been translated into more than half of the world's languages. It is in the languages of the Asian nations, especially those nations that oppose the colonial plunder of Western imperialism. Therefore, this book is reading material for the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, the soldiers of Vietnam, the heroes of Korea, and also for the youths of Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.

    "Report from the Gallows" has been published in three editions in the United States and has become the object of persecution by the United States government; the United States government immediately issued orders for the arrest of the publishers of the book on the pretext of their engaging in un-American activities.

    This is how Julius Fučík's works continue to fight against barbaric fascism and all its successors. His writings give us confidence in the victory of peace and warn us to remain vigilant against those who still threaten peace.

    The invincible army of glorious progressive humanity stands shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union, liberated China, heroic Korea, and other liberated nations to fight for lasting peace. Julius Fučík left these people with a message:

    “People, I love you! Be vigilant!”

    尤利乌斯·伏契克被害十周年
    捷克斯洛伐克  古丝妲·伏契科娃
    在这些日子里，捷克斯洛伐克人民都在纪念捷克斯洛伐克民族英雄尤利乌斯·伏契克被害十周年。他是一九四三年九月八日在柏林被法西斯德寇杀害的。
    尤利乌斯·伏契克的整个一生，都是在为工人阶级的解放、为祖国人民的自由进行反对野蛮的法西斯主义和战争的斗争。他是在共产主义和十月革命的旗帜下进行战斗的。他是为美好的将来而走入战斗的。为了这种思想，他从青年时代起就在共产党的行列中进行斗争。他是一个革命的新闻记者、文学批评家、鼓舞人民群众的宣传者。在资产阶级统治的捷克斯洛伐克，尤利乌斯·伏契克遭受了不断的迫害。他曾被监禁达数月之久。从一九三○年到一九三八年期间，他经常过着地下生活。
    当苏联实行头几个五年计划的时候，尤利乌斯·伏契克以记者身分住在苏联。他看到了第一批社会主义建设和新的社会主义的人的成长。尤利乌斯·伏契克在斯大林格勒州写出了最优美的报道，好像他预见到苏维埃国家的这一地区将要载入全人类的史册——在斯大林格勒战胜法西斯德寇和今日的伟大共产主义建设。
    一九四二年，在斯大林格勒保卫战期间，尤利乌斯·伏契克就已经落到德国法西斯者的手中了。在他的著作“绞索套着脖子时的报告”中，他自己也提到他是一九四二年四月二十四日被捕的。他在恐怖的、没有人性的“盖世太保”的监狱中也没有屈服过。他对法西斯主义的崩溃、苏联军队的胜利、捷克和斯洛伐克人民解放的信心丝毫都没有动摇过。所以德寇于一九四三年八月二十五日在柏林审判他时，他在法西斯法官面前说：
    “你们现在将向我宣读判决书。我知道，这
    个判决书是宣判一个人的死亡。但是我早已作好
    了你们的判决书，在这个判决书中用世界上所有
    正义的人民的鲜血写着：法西斯主义死亡！资本
    主义的奴役制度死亡！人类永生！未来属于共产
    主义！”
    一九四三年九月八日，也就是宣判后的第十四天，尤利乌斯·伏契克在柏林被杀害了。伏契克给那些法西斯刽子手所做的判决，由苏军——他们解放了千百万人，也把捷克和斯洛伐克人民从法西斯的奴役下解放出来——非常公正地执行了。人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国开始走向建设幸福生活的道路。
    尤利乌斯·伏契克的一生和他为祖国人民的自由而进行的英勇斗争，使他成为民族英雄。
    很多的矿山、工业企业、学校和少年先锋队都以尤利乌斯·伏契克的名字命名。在它们中新的社会主义生活正在增长着，伏契克也就是为了这种生活而牺牲的。
    在人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国的社会主义建设中，尤利乌斯·伏契克的向反动派作斗争和反映伟大苏联的典范的文章和论文，是起了作用的。这些文章现在都收为尤利乌斯·伏契克的文集出版了。至今，出版的有关苏联的书有：“在明天变成了昨天的国家”和“在亲爱的国土上”；有关文学论述和文学批评方面的书有：“三种学说”和“文学论文集”；有关向占领者和叛徒作斗争方面的书有：“我们爱自己的人民”和“绞索套着脖子时的报告”。
    全世界进步人士都热爱尤利乌斯·伏契克，因为他是那些为了祖国的自由，为了和平，为了人类幸福的生活而永远进行斗争的英雄们的体现。所以一九五○年在华沙举行的第二届世界保卫和平大会追赠给他以国际和平奖金特别荣誉奖。
    关于尤利乌斯·伏契克的一生，在苏联已写出两个剧本，苏联诗人李哈列夫并写了一首关于尤利乌斯·伏契克的诗“英雄”（即“友人的功绩”）。伟大的和平诗人巴勃罗·聂鲁达也写了“给尤利乌斯·伏契克”的诗。
    “绞索套着脖子时的报告”一书已译成全世界一半以上的语言。它是亚洲各民族的语言，特别是那些反对西方帝国主义殖民掠夺的民族的语言。因此，这本书是英雄的中国人民志愿军、越南的战士、朝鲜的英雄们的读物，也是巴西、阿根廷和墨西哥的青年们的读物。
    “绞索套着脖子时的报告”一书在美国已发行了三版，它成为美国政府机关迫害的对象；美国政府藉口该书的出版人进行非美活动而立即发出逮捕他们的命令。
    尤利乌斯·伏契克的著作就是这样地和野蛮的法西斯主义和它们所有继承者继续不断地进行着斗争。他的著作给予我们对和平胜利的信心，和对仍然在威胁和平的人保持警惕性的警告。
    光荣的进步人类的不可战胜的大军和苏联、解放了的中国、英雄的朝鲜，以及其他解放了的民族并肩站在一起为持久和平而斗争。尤利乌斯·伏契克曾向这些人留下了遗言：
    “人们，我是爱你们的！你们可要警惕啊！”
