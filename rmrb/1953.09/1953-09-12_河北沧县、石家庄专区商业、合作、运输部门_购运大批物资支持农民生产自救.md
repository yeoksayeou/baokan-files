The state-owned commercial and transportation departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Cangxian County and Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, are actively purchasing and transporting large quantities of materials to support farmers in disaster areas in production and self-relief. Transportation departments in the disaster areas are actively building bridges and repairing roads, organizing all possible transportation forces and tools to transport materials to the disaster areas in a timely manner. In areas with deep water, Cangxian Prefecture is organizing civilian boats; in areas with shallow water and muddy roads, they are organizing livestock and manpower; and in areas where vehicles can travel, they are organizing vehicles for transportation. Hengshui Transportation Company and the Highway Administration mobilized local people to repair the three highways from Hengshui to Jixian, Zaoqiang, and Wuyi overnight. They have also repaired the highways from Jingxian to Hejian, Hejian to Renqiu, Zangqiao to Hejian, and Ningjin to the boundary of Nanpi County. The Wuqiang County Grain Bureau adopted a "pounding and transporting" method to transport grain to the disaster areas. The Shenxian County Grain Bureau bypassed the Ziya River to the east and transported grain to the disaster areas around Hujia Pond. A large number of automobiles, large carts, small carts, livestock, manpower, and boats are using methods such as transporting, pushing, carrying on backs, and shouldering to continuously transport large quantities of grain, coal, matches, salt, kerosene, and wheat seeds to various flood-stricken areas to meet the needs of the disaster victims.

In terms of supply work, relevant departments are organizing sources of goods from all aspects and purchasing commodities. The Cangxian Prefecture Grain Administration has transferred 5 million catties of corn and a large amount of miscellaneous grains. The Cangxian Prefecture Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased a large quantity of matches from Tianjin, Jinan, Dezhou, and other places, 40,000 catties of salt from Linqing County, and more than 4,000 catties of kerosene from various places. Hengshui Department Store purchased a large quantity of matches in Shijiazhuang. The Hengshui Petroleum Company, Salt Company, and cooperatives, in order to facilitate the purchase of goods by grassroots cooperatives in the disaster areas, agreed to waive the procedures for issuing letters of introduction when grassroots cooperatives in the disaster areas came to purchase goods, and helped solve the difficulties of packaging and transportation.

In addition, according to the situation in the disaster areas, sales points and transportation stations have been appropriately added, which facilitates transportation and facilitates buying and selling for the disaster victims. The Cangxian County Grain Administration investigated the needs of the disaster victims and added 26 grain sales points. The Nanpi County Transportation Company has added four transshipment stations according to the road traffic and the needs of the disaster victims. The Hengshui County Cooperative Union and the Nanpi County Chengguan Village Cooperative adopted the method of delivering goods to the door for the convenience of the masses to buy and sell, and used small boats to deliver goods to the disaster-stricken villages in rotation, which was very popular among the masses.

Cadres of state-owned commercial and transportation departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have demonstrated a high degree of dedication to serving the people in their supply work. For example, nine cadres from the Yanshan County Cooperative Union walked more than 20 li and through more than four feet of water to transport eleven barrels of kerosene from Cangxian in a timely manner to solve the difficulties of the masses. At present, the Cangxian Prefecture has transported 44.14 million catties of coarse grains to the disaster areas according to the different needs of the people in various places; 186,000 catties of coal have been transported to Nanpi and Cangxian; and 5,680 catties of kerosene have been transported to Xianxian and Yanshan. A lot of daily necessities and 1.55 million catties of wheat seeds have also been transported. The timely transportation and supply of these materials has maintained the stability of prices in the disaster areas, the listed prices of commodities are in line with market prices, and it has played a great role in supporting the masses in draining water and planting wheat.

The Party and government leading organs in various places have strengthened specific leadership over the supply of materials in the disaster areas. The temporary drainage and disaster relief headquarters established by the Party and government leading organs of Shijiazhuang Prefecture in Hengshui has a supply team specially responsible for the supply of materials. Under the unified leadership of the headquarters, the issues of freight costs and the organizational division of labor among various departments in the supply of materials were resolved in a timely manner.

    河北沧县、石家庄专区商业、合作、运输部门
    购运大批物资支持农民生产自救
    河北省沧县、石家庄专区的国营商业、运输部门和供销合作社，正积极采购和调运大批物资，支持灾区农民生产自救。现在灾区的运输部门，正在积极搭桥修路，组织一切可以组织的运输力量和工具，以便及时把物资调运到灾区。沧县专区在水深的地方，组织民船，在水浅道路泥泞的地方，组织牲畜和人力，在可以行车的地方，组织车辆，进行运输。衡水运输公司和公路管理局，发动组织当地群众连夜抢修好衡水到冀县、枣强、武邑的三条公路。修通了景县到河间、河间到任邱、臧桥到河间、宁津到南皮县界的公路。武强县粮食局采用捣运办法，运粮到灾区。深县粮食局通过子牙河绕到东面，把粮食运送到护家池一带灾区。大批汽车、大车、小车、牲畜、人力和船只，正采用运、推、驮、背、扛等办法，源源不绝地把大批粮食、煤炭、火柴、食盐、煤油和麦种等货物运送到各水灾区，供应灾民需要。
      在供应工作方面，各有关部门正从各方面组织货源，采购商品，沧县专区粮食管理局调剂来五百万斤玉米和大批杂粮。河北省供销合作总社沧县专区办事处，就从天津、济南、德县等地采购了大批火柴，从临清县购来四万斤食盐，从各地采购了四千多斤煤油。衡水百货公司在石家庄采购了大批火柴。衡水石油公司、盐业公司和合作社，为便于灾区基层社进货，约定灾区的基层社来进货时，免去开介绍信的手续，并帮助解决包装和运输的困难。
    另外，根据灾区情况，适当增设售货点和运输站，便利了运输，又便利了灾民买卖。沧县粮食管理局，调查了灾民的需求情况，增设了二十六个售粮点。南皮县运输公司根据道路通运和灾民需求的情况，增设了四个转运站。衡水县合作社联合社和南皮县城关联村合作社，为了群众买卖方便，采用了送货上门的方法，用小船到灾村轮流送货，很受群众欢迎。
    各国营商业、运输部门和供销合作社的干部人员，在供应工作中，发挥了高度为人民服务的精神。如盐山县合作社联合社的九名干部，为及时解决群众的困难，走过二十多里远、四尺多深的水，从沧县漂运来十一筒煤油。现沧县专区已根据各地群众不同的需要，运到灾区四千四百一十四万斤粗粮；运到南皮、沧县十八万六千斤煤炭；运到献县、盐山五千六百八十斤煤油。还运到了不少日用百货和一百五十五万斤麦种。这些物资的及时运送和供应，保持了灾区的物价稳定，商品牌价和市价吻合，对支持群众排水种麦起了很大作用。
    对于灾区的物资供应工作，各地党、政领导机关都加强了具体领导。石家庄专区党、政领导机关在衡水成立的临时排水救灾指挥部，设有专门负责物资供应工作的供应小组，在指挥部统一领导下，及时解决了物资供应工作中的运费问题和各部门力量的组织分工结合等问题。
