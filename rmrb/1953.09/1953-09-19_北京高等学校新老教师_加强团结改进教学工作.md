Beijing Higher Education Institutions:
Strengthening Unity Between New and Veteran Teachers to Improve Teaching

Under the leadership of the Beijing Higher Education Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Beijing's higher education institutions have further implemented the policy of uniting with and transforming intellectuals, strengthening the unity between new and veteran teachers, and significantly improving teaching work.

Over the past year, after undergoing ideological remolding studies, departmental adjustments, and learning from the advanced teaching experiences of the Soviet Union, teachers in Beijing's higher education institutions have made significant achievements in ideological remolding and teaching improvement. During this period, teachers were generally united, but abnormal phenomena occurred between some new and veteran teachers, especially in the relationships between Party members, Youth League members, and veteran teachers among some young teachers, which to some extent affected the work of teaching reform.

Some young teachers are blindly arrogant and look down on veteran teachers. They despise the knowledge and teaching experience of veteran teachers. Some believe that the "knowledge and experience of veteran teachers are fragmentary and do not count as scholarship," while others feel that veteran teachers are not progressing as quickly as they are. Therefore, they do not adopt a humble attitude of learning and consultation towards veteran teachers, nor do they actively assist veteran teachers in improving their teaching work; they are unwilling to actively support and implement the work assigned by veteran teachers, but prefer to nitpick. Some young teachers arbitrarily modify lecture notes written by veteran teachers. Some department secretaries adopt a practice of monopolizing and substituting for the work of the department, without consulting or reporting to the department head.

On the other hand, many veteran professors, although they want to make progress, want to improve, and want to work hard to do a good job in teaching, lack confidence in today's teaching work due to the influence of old teaching ideas. They generally feel that the requirements are high, the burden is heavy, there is much criticism and little help, and their work is passive. Some veteran teachers are afraid that they have no future. The above-mentioned ideas have affected their work enthusiasm. For example, some veteran teachers said to young teaching assistants: "You teach this course, anyway, you will be teaching it in the future." Some rarely ask about the department's teaching work, and are unwilling to raise opinions even if they have them. They are even less willing to manage the work of teaching assistants, and are not active enough in cultivating teachers.

The reasons for the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena between some new and veteran teachers in Beijing's higher education institutions are mainly: after the erroneous viewpoints and bourgeois ideas of many veteran teachers were criticized in the ideological remolding movement, the Party committees of various schools failed to carry out ideological construction work in a timely manner, and did not pay attention to how to further leverage the advantages of each teacher, resulting in many veteran teachers losing confidence in their work. After the focus of school work shifted to teaching, some Party members also lacked sufficient understanding that teachers are the main force in teaching reform work, and did not pay attention to strengthening the work of uniting, transforming, and improving existing teachers. After the adjustment of departments, teachers bore a heavy burden and faced many difficulties in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reform, while the leadership and students placed excessively high demands on the teachers, causing some teachers to feel that their work was burdensome. At the same time, in the process of learning from the Soviet Union's experience, many young teachers did not respect veteran professors and looked down on them; while veteran teachers themselves had many ideological problems, which created an abnormal relationship between new and veteran teachers.

The Beijing Higher Education Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to strengthen the unity between new and veteran teachers and do a good job in teaching reform, first exposed the abnormal phenomena in the relationship between new and veteran teachers within the Party to attract everyone's attention and make everyone realize that to do a good job in teaching, it is necessary to strengthen the unity between new and veteran teachers. Then, it organized cadres to go deep into various schools to understand the situation and summarize the typical experiences of some schools in strengthening the unity between new and veteran teachers. In April of this year, it also convened an enlarged meeting of Party member cadres from various schools to discuss the issue of implementing the policy of uniting with and transforming intellectuals.

After the policy of uniting with and transforming intellectuals was further implemented in various schools, and at the same time, the work of teachers was strengthened, teachers were organized to conduct systematic theoretical studies, exchange teaching experiences, and rectify students' study discipline, the Party members and Youth League members among some young teachers adopted a positive and sincere attitude towards veteran teachers, giving full play to their expertise and helping them overcome difficulties in their work. This improved the relationship between new and veteran teachers, strengthened unity, and significantly improved teaching work. For example, the professors and teaching assistants of the Surveying Teaching and Research Group of Beijing Institute of Geology carried out criticism and self-criticism, changing the past disunity and improving teaching work. In the past, there had been disunity between Professor Zhou Ka, the director of the Teaching and Research Group, and the teaching assistants. The young teaching assistants believed that Professor Zhou Ka was conservative and said that he was an obstacle to the cultivation of teachers and teaching reform work. There would be arguments whenever the Teaching and Research Group held a meeting. Professor Zhou Ka felt that the young teaching assistants had poor professional skills and a bad attitude towards work. Therefore, the relationship had always been poor. With the help of the Party branch, the Teaching and Research Group conducted ideological examinations and launched criticism and self-criticism. The members of the Youth League changed their past uncooperative attitude towards Professor Zhou Ka, began to actively help him do a good job in teaching, and actively supported the various tasks he assigned, proactively discussing problems with him, reporting on the situation, and learning professional skills from him. At the same time, Professor Zhou Ka also conducted self-criticism. Everyone helped him analyze his thoughts and encouraged him to make progress. Some Party members and Youth League members among the teaching assistants in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature of Peking University did not respect veteran teachers enough in the past, so the enthusiasm of the veteran teachers was not fully utilized. Now, these Party members and Youth League members among the teaching assistants realize the important role of veteran teachers in teaching, can proactively discuss teaching problems with veteran teachers, learn professional skills from them, greatly improve the enthusiasm of the teachers, improve teaching work, and improve the relationship between each other.

    北京高等学校新老教师
    加强团结改进教学工作
    北京各高等学校在中共北京市高等学校委员会领导下，进一步贯彻团结改造知识分子政策，加强了新老教师的团结，显著地改进了教学工作。
    一年多来，北京各高等学校的教师经过思想改造学习、院系调整和学习苏联的先进教学经验以后，在思想改造和教学工作的改进方面，都获得了不少的成绩。在这个时期中，教师之间基本上是团结的，但在部分新老教师之间，尤其是在某些青年教师中的党员、青年团员和老教师的关系方面，发生了不正常的现象，因而在某种程度上影响了教学改革工作。
    有些青年教师，盲目自大，看不起老教师。他们轻视老教师的知识、教学经验，有的认为老教师的“知识、经验，零星片断，算不了学问”，有的觉得老教师不如自己进步快。因此，他们对老教师不是采取虚心学习和商量的态度，不是积极协助老教师改进教学工作；对老教师所布置的工作也不愿积极支持和执行，而是喜欢挑剔毛病。有些年轻教师看了老教师写的讲义，随便加以修改。有的系秘书，对系的工作采取包揽代替的作法，不向系主任请示报告。
    另一方面，许多老教授虽然要求进步，要求提高，想努力做好教学工作，但由于他们本身受到旧的教学思想的影响，对今天的教学工作信心不强。他们普遍感觉到要求高，负担重，批评多，帮助少，工作被动。有些老教师怕自己无前途。上述种种思想影响了他们的工作积极性。例如，有的老教师对青年助教说：“这门课你教吧，反正将来总会是你教的。”有的对系的教学工作过问很少，即使有意见也不愿提。对助教工作更不愿多管，对培养师资工作也表现不够积极。
    北京各高等学校某些新老教师间产生上述不正常现象的原因，主要是：在思想改造运动中许多老教师的错误观点和资产阶级思想受到了批判之后，各校党委未能及时地进行思想建设工作，没有注意到如何进一步发挥每个教师的优点，以致使不少老教师失去了工作的信心。而在学校工作的重心转向教学以后，有些党员对教师是教学改革工作的主要力量这一点也认识不足，不注意加强团结、改造和提高现有师资的工作。院系调整以后，在学习苏联先进经验进行教学改革工作中，教师们负担很重，困难又多，而领导方面和学生却对教师们提出过高的要求，致使部分教师感到工作沉重。同时在学习苏联经验的过程中，许多年轻的教师不尊重老教授，看不起他们；而老教师本身也存在许多思想问题，这就造成了新老教师间关系不正常的现象。
    中共北京市高等学校委员会，为了加强新老教师的团结，做好教学改革工作，曾首先在党内揭露了新老教师间关系不正常的现象，以引起大家的重视，使大家认识到要把教学工作做好，必须加强新老教师的团结。接着组织干部深入各校了解情况，总结了某些学校在加强新老教师团结方面的典型经验。今年四月间，并召开了各校党员干部扩大会议，对贯彻团结改造知识分子政策问题进行了讨论。
    在各校进一步贯彻团结改造知识分子的政策，同时加强了教员工作，组织教师进行系统的理论学习，交流了教学经验，整顿了学生的学习纪律以后，某些青年教师中的党员、青年团员对老教师采取了积极的、诚恳的态度，发挥他们的专长，帮助他们克服工作中的困难。因而改善了新老教师的关系，加强了团结，并显著地改进了教学工作。例如，北京地质学院测量教研组的教授和助教，开展批评与自我批评，改变了过去的不团结现象，使教学工作有了改进。教研组主任周卡教授和助教之间，过去一直闹不团结，青年助教认为周卡教授保守，说他是培养师资和教学改革工作中的障碍，教研组一开会就闹意见。周卡教授则觉得青年助教业务差，工作态度不好。因此关系一直搞不好。在党支部的帮助下，教研组进行了思想检查，展开了批评与自我批评，团员们改变了过去对周卡教授的不合作态度，开始主动帮助他搞好教学，并积极支持他所布置的各项工作，主动地和他商量问题，汇报情况，并向他学习业务。同时，周卡教授也进行了自我批评，大家帮助他分析了思想，并鼓励他的进步。北京大学中国语言文学系的有些党员、青年团员的助教，过去对老教师不够尊重，因此使老教师积极性未能完全发挥。现在这些党员、青年团员的助教认识到老教师在教学中的重要作用，能够主动地和老教师商量教学中的问题，向他们学习业务，大大地提高了教师们的积极性，改进了教学工作，也改善了彼此间的关系。
