Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th. According to reports from our captured personnel who recently broke through the control of the Li bandit special agents and returned, in the US POW camps, there are many of our captured personnel who were listed as not being directly repatriated. Because they revealed their desire to return home, they were beaten to death, injured, and taken away by the US military and Li bandit special agents.

　　Park Won-yang and others, Korean People's Army returnees who were handed over to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 15th, were originally detained in POW camps on Geoje Island that held POWs not directly repatriated. They saw on June 14th of this year, a captured personnel from our side in his thirties was forcibly brought by the US side to this POW camp for POWs not directly repatriated. That person resolutely resisted and sang "General Kim Il-sung's Song." The US military, Li puppet army, and special agents beat him with pickaxes and wooden sticks every day. They beat him for six consecutive days, and he was finally brutally beaten to death. In early August, when the direct exchange of POWs was about to begin, more than thirty people were subjected to hanging and being force-fed chili water, six of whom were seriously injured and then taken away by the US military. These people were mostly because they inadvertently revealed their desire to go home. For example, one captured person surnamed Kim was beaten unconscious and taken away by special agents just because he said in the toilet, "I live only to see my parents and wife." Wu Shixu, who returned with Park Won-yang and others, also said: "On August 19th, the US military arrested Kim Hong-guk, Li Tae-joon, and other 78 people who requested repatriation, beat and kicked them, and locked them up."

　　Park Won-yang and others said that in the POW camp, special agents forbade POWs from talking to each other. Our captured personnel could only sit silently all day long, so most of the names of the people who were beaten to death, injured, and taken away are unknown.

　　They also said that because the special agents deducted food, the lives of POWs not directly repatriated were worse than those of POWs directly repatriated. Almost every day, it was moldy rice made of barley and coarse rice, and the dishes were made with salt water, and they were not full.

    许多要求遣返的我被俘人员遭到残酷迫害
    【新华社开城二十日电】据最近突破李匪特务控制归来的我方被俘人员报告，在美方战俘营中，有不少被列为不直接遣返的我方被俘人员，由于流露出要求遣返回家的意愿，被美军和李匪特务打死、打伤和抓走了。
    十五日由中立国遣返委员会遣交我方的朝鲜人民军归来人员朴元阳等原被拘禁在巨济岛上拘留不直接遣返战俘的战俘营。他们曾在今年六月十四日，看到一个三十多岁的我方被俘人员被美方强拉到这个拘留不直接遣返战俘的战俘营来，那个人坚决反抗，高唱“金日成将军之歌”。美军、李伪军和特务分子就天天用洋镐、木棍打他，一连打了六天，他终于被残暴地打死。在八月初，直接遣返的战俘即将开始交换时，又有三十多个人遭到吊打、灌辣椒水，其中有六个打成重伤后又被美军抓走。这些人大都是因为无意中流露了自己想回家的愿望。如其中一个姓金的被俘人员只因在厕所里说过“我活着就是为了想见父母妻子”，就被特务打得晕过去并被抓走。与朴元阳等一同回来的吴时旭也说：“八月十九日，美军把金洪国、李泰俊等七十八个要求遣返的人抓去，拳打脚踢了一顿，关了起来。”
    朴元阳等说，在战俘营中，特务禁止战俘们互相交谈，我方被俘人员整天只能闭口坐着，所以上述被打死打伤和抓走的人的名字大部分都不知道。
    他们又说，由于特务们克扣粮食，不直接遣返战俘的生活比直接遣返的战俘更为恶劣。差不多每天都是大麦加糙米的霉饭，用盐水做菜，都吃不饱。
