    Various Organizations Should Package Printed Matter Securely to Avoid Breakage and Loss
    ——Reader Visit
    Editor's Note: Comrade Zhao Geng of the Service Section of the Beijing Post Office visited the Reader Letters Group of this newspaper on September 18th, reflecting that some organizations are careless about packaging confidential printed matter, often resulting in breakage and loss, which could leak state secrets and add difficulties to the postal delivery work. Comrade Zhao Geng's opinion is correct and is published below. We hope to draw the attention of various organizations to ensure that printed matter is packaged securely when mailed.
    The Printing Section of the Beijing Post Office received a bundle of printed matter returned from the Xi'an Post Office in Shaanxi Province on May 23rd this year. Because this bundle of printed matter was sealed with thin yellow paper, it broke apart at the Xi'an Post Office, and the recipient's name and address were lost, making delivery impossible. Upon opening and inspection, it contained nineteen copies each of a timber volume table, timber specifications, and timber measurement methods; and seventy-four copies of various steel standards formulated by the Ministry of Heavy Industry (internal documents). The Beijing Post Office considered this bundle of printed matter to be very important documents and should be returned to the originating organization; therefore, it contacted the Central Forestry Department, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, and the Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, but none of these units claimed to have sent it. As a result, this bundle of important printed matter has not been found by its original owner and remains in the post office.
    In addition, some organizations or individuals do not pay attention to packaging when mailing general printed matter. For example: the Cadre Department of the Artillery Command of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission sent four copies of a resume to Representative Wang of a factory in Nanjing; the Propaganda Department of the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission sent six books of the Party history teaching outline to Political Commissar Zhu of a certain place in Tanggu; the Political Department of the Health Department of the Military Commission sent the "Liberation Army Pictorial" to military medical universities across the country, with each bundle containing twenty to thirty copies. The packaging of these items was very sloppy, and some bundles were not even bundled. These mails had already broken apart before they could even be mailed and could not be delivered. There are also such situations in printed matter sent from other places, and dozens of cases are discovered every day.
    After the post office receives the printed matter for delivery every day, it must be sorted into postal bags according to different routes and transported to various places by trains, cars, and other means of transportation. If the packaging is not good, even if the post office staff is extra careful, it is easy to cause breakage and loss. In order to ensure that state secrets are not lost and to ensure that each piece of printed matter can be delivered quickly and safely, in addition to the post office strictly implementing its own packaging methods, it is hoped that all units or individuals must securely package and tightly bundle the printed matter they deliver (but must be easy to open for inspection) to avoid loosening and errors.

### 各机关邮寄印刷品要包装牢固以免破散遗失——读者来访

专栏：读者来信摘要

    各机关邮寄印刷品要包装牢固以免破散遗失
    ——读者来访
    编者按：北京邮局服务科赵庚同志，在九月十八日来访本报读者来信组，反映有些机关对邮寄机要印刷品包装草率，往往发生破散遗失情事，泄露国家机密，并给邮局投递工作增加了一些困难。赵庚同志的意见是正确的，特发表如下。希望引起各机关注意，在邮寄印刷品时切实包装牢固。
    北京邮局印刷股，在今年五月二十三日，接到陕西西安邮局退回来一捆平寄印刷品。因为这捆印刷品是用薄薄的黄纸封包的，到了西安邮局就破散了，收件单位的名称、地点都已遗失，无法投递。经拆开检查，内有木材体积表、木材规格及木材检尺办法各十九本；重工业部制订的各项钢铁标准七十四本（系内部文件）。北京邮局认为这捆印刷品都是很重要的文件，应该退回原寄机关；为此，即和中央林业部、建筑工程部、重工业部钢铁工业局等单位联系，但各该单位都说不是他们发出的。因此，这捆重要的印刷品，直到现在还未找到原主而存在邮局里。
    此外，还有些机关或个人寄一般的印刷品也不注意包装，如：中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会炮兵司令部干部部寄给南京某厂王代表的四本履历书，军委后勤政治部宣传部寄塘沽某处朱政委的党史教学大纲等六本书；军委卫生部政治部寄各地军医大学的解放军画报，每捆二、三十本，包装都很马虎，有的捆也不捆，这些邮件甚至还未来得及寄出就已经破散而无法投递了。外埠寄来的印刷品中，也有这种情形，每天都要发现几十件。
    邮局每天收到交寄的印刷品后，要根据不同的路线，分别装入邮袋，经由火车、汽车等各种交通工具运往各地。如果包装不好，即使邮局经办人员格外小心，也容易发生破裂散乱而丢失的事故。为保证国家机密的邮件不被遗失，为保证每件印刷品都能迅速稳妥地送到，除了邮局严格执行它自己所规定的包装方法外，并希望各单位或个人，务必对自己交寄的印刷品封装坚固，捆扎紧实（但须易于拆开检视），以免松散，发生差错。
