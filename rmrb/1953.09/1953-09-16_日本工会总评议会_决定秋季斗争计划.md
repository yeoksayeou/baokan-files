Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), with approximately three million members, held a meeting of its Standing Committee on the 11th and decided on its autumn struggle plan for this year.

The Sohyo Standing Committee meeting decided to launch the first struggle in late September, centered on the Japan Coal Miners' Union and the All Japan Auto Industry Workers' Union, which are currently fighting against the dismissal measures of monopoly capitalists, and to conduct the second struggle in late October when the Yoshida government convenes an extraordinary session of the Diet. During this period, each union will take unified action to oppose dismissals by the capitalists and demand the payment of year-end allowances. The plan also stipulates that a general mobilization rally will be held simultaneously across the country on November 11th, at which time each union will concentrate its forces for the struggle.

Currently, some union organizations affiliated with Sohyo are already engaged in struggles against the so-called "enterprise rationalization" of dismissals by the capitalists. The recent Japan Coal Miners' Union Congress decided to demand that the capitalists increase wages by 4,000 yen from October while opposing dismissals. In addition, the All Japan Express Workers' Union and the General Federation of Japan Private Railway Workers' Unions are also engaged in struggles against "enterprise rationalization" and demanding the payment of year-end allowances.

    日本工会总评议会
    决定秋季斗争计划
    【新华社十五日讯】东京消息：拥有会员约三百万人的日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）在十一日召开常任干事会会议，决定了今年秋季的斗争计划。
    “总评”常任干事会会议决定：以正在和垄断资本家的解雇措施作斗争的日本煤矿工会和全日本汽车产业工会为中心，在九月下旬发起第一次斗争，并在十月下旬吉田政府召开临时国会的时候进行第二次斗争。各工会在此期间将采取统一的斗争行动，反对资方解雇并要求发给年终津贴。计划还规定于十一月十一日在全国各地同时召开总奋起大会，各工会将在这时集中力量进行斗争。
    目前，“总评”所属的一些工会组织已在进行斗争，反对资方解雇工人的所谓“企业合理化”。最近举行的日本煤矿工会大会，已经决定在反对解雇的同时，要求资方从十月起提高工资四千日元。此外，全日本通运公司工会和日本私营铁道工会总联合会，也正在为反对“企业合理化”、要求发给年终津贴而展开斗争。
