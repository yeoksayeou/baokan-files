    苏联部长会议和苏共中央
    发布进一步发展饲畜业的决定
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十六日莫斯科各报刊载了苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会“关于进一步发展苏联饲畜业和降低集体农民、工人和职员所饲养的牲畜产品的义务交售标准的措施”的决定。
    根据一九五三年九月七日苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的决议，苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会拟定了一系列的措施，以增加牲畜头数并增进其产品生产率，以便消除饲畜业发展中不可容忍的落后状态，并增加肉类、奶类、牛油、羊毛、蛋类和其他畜产品的产量。除了规定增加牲畜头数及增进其产品生产率的任务外，苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会已采取措施改进饲畜业收购办法，提高集体农庄和集体农民在发展饲畜业方面所得的物质鼓励，并加强这一农业部门的物质和技术后备力量。新的提高了的畜产品采购价格将大大促进饲畜业的发展。
