Cooperatives in the waterlogged areas of Shandong Province are actively promoting the sales of local and subsidiary products and supplying production and living materials to disaster victims through supply and marketing operations, supporting disaster victims' self-salvation through production. The Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Agency plans to allocate 60 billion yuan before the Spring Festival as funds for purchasing local and subsidiary products from disaster areas and plans to hold a provincial internal exchange meeting of cooperatives this month to promote the exchange of local products in a planned way. Local cooperatives in disaster areas are also conducting in-depth investigations to understand the production and sales of local and subsidiary products in disaster areas. While formulating sales plans, they are actively contacting state-owned trading departments and fraternal cooperatives to expand product sales channels. The Gaomi County Cooperative plans to help disaster victims sell 30,000 jin of fresh eggs, 30,000 jin of melon seeds, 40,000 jin of apricot kernels, and more than ten kinds of materials such as miscellaneous copper and medicinal materials in the third quarter. In addition to selling fat pigs for disaster victims, the Laiyang County Cooperative is also contacting state-owned export companies and exporters to sell some export goods for disaster victims. The Zanhua Third District Cooperative has currently sold more than 1,400 chi of native cloth and more than 600 jin of scrap copper and iron for disaster victims. While promoting the sales of local and subsidiary products, local cooperatives are vigorously organizing the supply of materials according to the urgent needs of disaster victims in their current production and life. After the floods occurred in various places in the Laiyang area, the county cooperatives immediately purchased late autumn crop seeds from other places to support disaster victims in rushing to plant late autumn crops. By the beginning of August, the cooperatives in the disaster areas of Zanhua County had supplied more than 300 jin of rapeseed seeds to disaster victims, and also transferred 200 jin of buckwheat seeds from the Provincial Cooperative General Agency. In order to meet the needs of disaster victims for small farm tools, the Yenaan County Cooperative Union organized a group of blacksmiths and carpenters to go to the disaster areas to repair farm tools and furniture for farmers. The Huang County Cooperative has purchased 800 iron shovels and more than 2,300 brooms from other places, preparing to supply the needs of disaster victims for autumn harvest and autumn planting. In terms of grain, winter clothing, furniture, and transportation tools, local cooperatives are also actively organizing transportation and vigorously carrying out supplies in the spirit of speed and timeliness. The Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Agency has also sent people to Huimin, Dezhou, Liaocheng and other areas to purchase old clothes, old quilts, and old cotton to regulate and supply the needs of disaster areas. The Yutai County Cooperative plans to supply 2 million jin of coarse grains to disaster areas during the autumn and winter of this year and next year. The Laixi County Cooperative has transferred 1.2 million jin of grain from the local grain bureau to start supplying. In addition to supplying disaster victims with grain, the Laiyang County Cooperative also purchased a batch of furniture such as pots, bowls, spoons, and ladles to supply the living needs of disaster victims. In the supply of materials, many cooperative cadres braved the rain and waded through the water to personally deliver the materials to the doors of disaster victims. The disaster victims are very grateful for the cooperative's spirit of serving the masses so highly, which has inspired their confidence in overcoming the disaster.

    山东省灾区的合作社
    大力推销土副产供应物资支持灾民生产
    山东省被水淹地区合作社正积极通过供销业务，大力推销灾区土、副产品，供应灾民生产资料和生活资料，支持灾民生产自救。山东省合作总社计划在春节前拨出六百亿元的款子作为收购灾区土、副产品的资金，并准备在本月召开全省合作社内部土产交流会，有计划地推动各地土产交流工作。各地灾区合作社也正在深入调查了解灾区土、副产品产销情况，一面订出推销计划，一面积极与国营贸易部门及兄弟合作社联系，开拓产品销路。高密县合作社计划在第三季度帮助灾民推销鲜蛋三万斤、瓜子三万斤、杏仁四万斤，以及杂铜、药材等十余种物资。莱阳县合作社除正在给灾民推销肥猪外，并正与国营出口公司及出口商联系，给灾民推销一部分出口物资。沾化三区合作社目前已给灾民推销了土布一千四百余尺，碎铜碎铁六百余斤。在推销土、副产品的同时，各地合作社正根据灾民当前生产、生活上的迫切需要，大力组织物资供应。莱阳专区各县合作社在各地发生水灾以后，便立即从外地购进晚秋作物种籽，扶持灾民抢种晚秋作物。沾化县各灾区合作社到八月上旬已供应到灾民手中的菜籽种有三百多斤，此外还从省合作总社调进荞麦种二百斤。掖南县合作社联合社为了满足灾民小农具的需要，组织了一批铁木匠到灾区给农民修理农具和家具。黄县合作社已从外地购进铁锨八百张、扫帚两千三百余把，准备供应灾民秋收秋种需要。在粮食、冬衣、家具及运输工具等方面，各地合作社也正本着迅速、及时的精神，积极组织调运，大力进行供应。山东省合作总社也派人前往惠民、德州、聊城等专区收购旧衣、旧被、旧棉，调剂和供应灾区需要。鱼台县合作社计划在今秋明春期间供应灾区粗粮二百万斤。莱西县合作社已从当地粮食局调进粮食一百二十万斤开始进行供应。莱阳县合作社除供应灾民粮食外，还采购一批锅、碗、瓢、杓等家具，以供应灾民生活需要。在供应物资中，很多合作社干部都冒雨涉水，亲自将物资送到灾民门上去。灾民对合作社这样高度为群众服务的精神非常感激，鼓舞了他们战胜灾荒的信心。
