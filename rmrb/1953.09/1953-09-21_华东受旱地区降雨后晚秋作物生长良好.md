In parts of the drought-stricken areas south of the Yangtze River in East China, most areas have received rainfall since mid-to-late August and early September, greatly alleviating the drought situation, with the exception of some areas such as Huizhou in Anhui, Zhoushan in Zhejiang, Songjiang in Jiangsu, and the suburbs of Shanghai.

Various localities have seized the opportunity after the rain to promptly carry out emergency planting, replanting, and supplementary planting. In Zhejiang Province, the supplementary planting of late autumn crops such as buckwheat, autumn sweet potatoes, and autumn cowpeas can be completed before the White Dew solar term. In many areas of Fujian, the late rice has undergone one to two rounds of weeding, and some have already applied topdressing fertilizer. The late autumn crops replanted and supplementarily planted in various localities are generally growing well. In Minhou, Fujian, 900,000 mu of intercropped late rice and 850,000 mu of single-season late rice are growing well, and some have already begun to head. In Zhejiang Province, single-season late rice and double-season intercropped late rice are in the stage of booting, and some have begun to head.

In the aforementioned drought-stricken areas, over the past two months, the broad masses, under the leadership of the local Party committees and governments, have actively built small-scale water conservancy projects and developed water sources, playing a significant role in fighting drought. According to incomplete statistics from 272 townships in Jinjiang Prefecture, Fujian Province, by mid-August, a total of more than 5,740 ditches and canals had been dug and repaired, and more than 6,350 ponds and wells had been renovated and newly dug, capable of irrigating more than 150,400 mu of land. In many areas, farmers have organized themselves to work day and night in order to overcome the drought. Farmers in Nan'an, Anxi, and other places in Fujian used eight, nine, or even more than a dozen waterwheels connected together to move water over the mountains and irrigate fields far from water sources.

Many urban workers have demonstrated a high degree of fraternal love in supporting the drought resistance efforts of their farmer brothers. In Xiaozhen, Fenghua County, Zhejiang Province, and other places, transport workers organized drought resistance teams to support farmers. In Yiwu County, 80% of the transport workers were involved in drought resistance. In Qingzhou Township, Minhou, Fujian Province, more than 200 transport workers voluntarily assisted farmers in building four sluice gates. Workers in Shanghai organized nine慰问 (comforting) teams, carrying six water pumps to慰问 (comfort) and support farmers in the suburban districts and Songjiang, Baoshan, and Shanghai counties. Workers at the Shanghai Private China Diesel Engine Factory rushed to complete the assembly of three water pumps in one day, September 1, to support farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai. In the Xinjing District (suburban area) of Shanghai, up to 40 water pumps were operating every day, and most of the drivers were workers from various factories or construction sites in Shanghai. This gave farmers great encouragement and increased their confidence in fighting drought. Various localities also organized large numbers of water pumps to be sent to the countryside. The districts of Shanghai alone transferred more than 200 water pumps to support farmers in the suburbs. Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, Xiamen, Fu'an and other places in Fujian Province transferred more than 60 units. Jiaxing, Zhejiang allocated eight units. All of these solved great difficulties for the farmers. The water pumps transferred from Fujian and Jiaxing alone could irrigate more than 80,000 mu of land.

    华东受旱地区降雨后晚秋作物生长良好
    华东长江以南部分受旱地区，自八月中、下旬及九月初以后大部降雨，除安徽的徽州、浙江的舟山、江苏的松江等专区和上海近郊等部分地区外，旱情已大为缓和。
    各地抓紧了雨后时机，及时进行抢种、改种、补种工作。浙江省补种的荞麦、秋甘薯、秋小豆等晚秋作物，白露前可以全部完成。福建很多地区晚稻已进行一遍至二遍的除草工作，有的且已施了追肥。各地补种、改种的晚秋作物一般都生长良好。福建闽侯九十万亩间作晚稻和八十五万亩单季晚稻都生长良好，有的已开始抽穗。浙江省单季晚稻和双季间作晚稻正在孕穗，部分已开始抽穗。
    上述各受旱地区两个月以来，广大群众在当地党和政府的领导下，积极兴修小型水利，开辟水源，对抗旱起了很大作用。仅据福建省晋江专区二百七十二个乡的不完全统计，到八月中旬止，共挖修沟、渠五千七百四十多条，整修及新掘池塘、水井六千三百五十余口，可灌田十五万零四百多亩。很多地区农民为了战胜旱灾，组织起来，日以继夜地工作。福建南安、安溪等地农民用八节、九节甚至十几节水车连接起来搬水过山，灌溉离水源远的田亩。
    很多城市工人，在支援农民兄弟抗旱斗争中，更发挥了高度的友爱。浙江省奉化县肖镇等地搬运工人组织了支援农民的抗旱大队，义乌县百分之八十的搬运工人均投入了抗旱斗争。福建省闽侯青州乡二百多名搬运工人，自动协助农民修筑了四座水闸，上海市的工人组织了九个慰问队，携着六部抽水机到市郊各区及松江、宝山、上海三县慰问并支援抗旱的农民。上海市私营中国柴油机器厂的工人，为了支援上海郊区农民抗旱，在九月一日一天内突击完成了三部抽水机的装配工作。上海市新泾区（郊区）最多时每天曾开动四十台抽水机，司机大部是上海市各工厂或工地的工人。这给了农民很大的鼓舞，并提高了农民抗旱信心。各地并组织了大批抽水机下乡，只上海市各区为了支援郊区农民抗旱，就调出抽水机二百多部。福建省福州、漳州、厦门、福安等地调出了六十多部。浙江嘉兴拨出了八部。都给农民解决了很大困难，只是上述福建和嘉兴调出的抽水机，就可灌田八万多亩。
