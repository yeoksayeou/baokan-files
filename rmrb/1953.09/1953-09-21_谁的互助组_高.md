Whose Mutual Aid Team is "Superior"?
By our reporter Lü Jianzhong

A story is circulating among the people of Caosi Township, Xiangcheng County, Henan Province:

Last year, when the mutual aid teams were mistakenly "ranked and classified" according to "three grades and nine levels," the cadres rated Sun Xiangtian's mutual aid team as a "first-class advanced team" and Wu Laowu's mutual aid team as a "third-class low-level team." Then they respectively praised and criticized them, broadcasting it for three days.

However, despite the cadres boasting that Sun Xiangtian's team had "established various systems," was "politically good," and "awarded a new-style plow by the county," etc., the masses were secretly unconvinced; the reason was that Sun Xiangtian's team did not harvest as much grain as others.

In order to make his "flagship team" even more "advanced," Sun Xiangtian convened three days of team member meetings during the busy summer harvest and planting season last year, forcibly pooling all the team's livestock. The mother of middle peasant Sun Dabing watched her plump donkey being forcibly taken away, and cried bitterly.

Once the livestock were pooled, more problems arose. Livestock were exchanged small for large, sold cheap and bought dear, resulting in many losses. Sun Xiangtian went from door to door during the day urging for grass and fodder, and at night he held meetings until midnight. When he got home, he saw the livestock were so hungry that they were "pawing the trough," and he had to feed them himself. The four livestock of the whole team were pooled for three and a half months, wasting about more than one thousand catties of fodder compared to each household feeding them separately, producing one-third less manure, and also making the livestock thin. As a result, the whole team's wheat production decreased by 45% last year, and the autumn harvest decreased even more. Poor peasant Sun Lianshan, with four and a half mu of land, owed 498,600 yuan, and even selling the bricks and tiles from a dismantled gatehouse was not enough to pay off the debt.

The autumn production appraisal meeting was held. When it came to appraising Sun Xiangtian's team, the masses were silent. Someone asked the district cadre: "Xiangtian is a flagship team, will the government be happy if you rate it badly?" The district cadre said that they should be realistic. So, Wu Laowu came out to speak:

“Xiangtian, let me compare with you. You are a model, and the government has awarded you a new-style plow. The 'public cotton' (meaning cotton that doesn't produce bolls, like a rooster doesn't lay eggs) grown by your team yielded five jin (seed cotton) per mu, while our team's cotton yielded forty jin (seed cotton) per mu. Your team's tobacco yielded one hundred and fifty jin per mu, while our team's tobacco yielded two hundred and fifty jin per mu. Your team lost 600,000 yuan in sideline production in one season, while our team earned 500,000 yuan in sideline production in one season. The weeds in your team's fields block the sun..."

"Let's not compare that. I admit that my team's land is not as well farmed as yours. Let's compare mutual aid teams, my team is superior to your team!"

"Your team has superior conditions and good systems, but there are many quarrels, the team members are hungry, and they have to dismantle the gatehouse to pay off debts!"

The whole audience burst into laughter. Who's mutual aid team is superior? Finally, the masses concluded: "Whoever harvests more grain is superior!" Thus, Wu Laowu won over Sun Xiangtian.

Article 7 of the "Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China states: "Demonstration is multi-faceted, but everything needs to be able to truly improve productivity and achieve the goal of producing more grain or other crops and increasing income... This is the standard for checking the quality of work of any mutual aid team and agricultural producers' cooperative."

In the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, many cadres made a fundamental mistake in their guiding ideology, which was to ignore and deviate from the goal of "producing more grain and increasing income" and blindly and subjectively manipulate forms. Some agricultural producers' cooperatives, although their output has increased year by year compared to individual farmers and mutual aid teams, the actual income of the members has decreased year by year due to "large scale and many debts." This seriously dampened the enthusiasm of farmers for mutual aid and cooperation.

Taking Jia Zhenbin's agricultural producers' cooperative in Lushan County as an example: in 1951, the average wheat yield per mu was 158 jin, and the average actual income per member was 220 jin; in 1952, the average wheat yield per mu was 164.5 jin, and the average actual income per member was 114 jin; in 1953, the average wheat yield per mu was 167.5 jin, and the average actual income per member was only 83 jin. Similar situations existed in almost all regions. In Lushan County alone, there were more than a dozen such cooperatives. On the one hand, this was due to the excessive expansion of public property within the cooperative, and on the other hand, it was also related to the fact that the people's government provided too much loan to some teams and cooperatives without considering their actual needs, which were used by the teams to increase unnecessary expenses. Some individual farmers, holding white steamed buns, knocked on their bowls with chopsticks and ridiculed the cooperative members who had low incomes and hard lives, saying: "Look, individual farming gets you white steamed buns." Making the cooperative members feel unable to laugh or cry.

There are also some teams and cooperatives that have achieved higher grain production and enabled team members and cooperative members to obtain higher actual incomes than ordinary farmers. They have greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of team members or cooperative members and naturally become the banner leading the vast number of farmers forward.

### 谁的互助组“高”

    谁的互助组“高”
    本报记者　吕建中
    河南襄城县草寺乡群众中流传着这样的一件事：
    去年错误地把互助组按“三等九级”进行“评比站队”的时候，干部把孙向田的互助组评为“一等高级组”，把武老五的互助组评为“三等低级组”，然后分别进行表扬、批评，广播三天。
    但是，尽管干部夸耀孙向田组“建立了各种制度”呀，“政治好”呀，“县里奖过新式犁”呀，等等，群众心里却暗暗不服；原因就是孙向田组打粮食没有别人多。
    孙向田为了把自己这个“旗帜组”弄得更“高级”些，在去年夏收夏种时节，不顾农忙，连开三天组员大会，强把全组的牲口合了槽。中农孙大彬的母亲眼看着自己那头肥壮的驴子强被牵走，哭得十分伤心。
    组内牲口一合槽，问题就更多了。牲口以小换大，贱卖贵买，亏赔了许多。孙向田白天挨门逐户催草要料，晚上开半夜会回家看看牲口饿得直“刨槽”，还得自己动手喂牲口。全组四头牲口合槽三个半月，约比各户自己喂浪费一千多斤草料，少积三分之一的粪，还把牲口给喂瘦了。结果是：全组去年小麦减产百分之四十五，秋季减产更多。贫农孙连山，四亩半地，负债四十九万八千六百元，拆了一个门楼卖掉砖瓦还没有还清。
    秋季开生产评比会。当评到孙向田组时，群众都不作声。有人问区干部：“向田是旗帜组呀，评坏了政府愿意吗？”区干部说应该实事求是。于是，武老五出来发言了：
     “向田，我跟您比比，您是模范，政府奖过新式犁。您组种的‘公棉花’（意思是说棉花不结桃，好像公鸡不下蛋一样）每亩收五斤（皮棉），俺组棉花每亩收四十斤（皮棉）。您组烟叶每亩收一百五十斤，俺组烟叶每亩收二百五十斤。您组副业一季赔了六十万元，俺组副业一季赚了五十万元。您组地里的草遮住太阳……”
    “咱不比这。我承认我组的地种得不如您。咱比互助组，我的组比您的组高呀！”
    “您组条件高、制度好，可就是吵架多，组员饿肚子，拆了门楼子还债！”
    全场一阵哄笑。究竟谁的互助组高呢？最后由群众作了结论：“谁打粮多谁的高！”于是，武老五比胜了孙向田。
    中共中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”第七条写道：“示范是在多方面的，但一切事情需要能够真正做到提高生产率，达到多产粮食或其他作物、增加收入这一个目的……这是检查任何互助组和生产合作社的工作好坏的标准。”
    农村互助合作运动中，不少干部在指导思想上犯了一条根本的错误，就是忽视和脱离了“多产粮食，增加收入”这一个目的，盲目地主观主义地去摆弄形式。有些农业生产合作社，虽然产量比单干户和互助组逐年增加，但由于“摊子大，债务多”，社员的实际收入反而逐年减少。这就严重地打击了农民的互助合作的积极性。
    以鲁山县贾振彬的农业生产合作社为例：一九五一年小麦每亩平均产量是一百五十八斤，社员每人平均实际收入二百二十斤；一九五二年小麦每亩平均产量是一百六十四斤半，社员每人平均实际收入一百一十四斤；一九五三年小麦每亩平均产量是一百六十七斤半，社员每人平均实际收入只有八十三斤。各地差不多都有类似的情形。仅鲁山一县就有十多个这样的社。这一方面是由于社内过多地扩大公共财产，另方面也与人民政府对某些组和社不根据其实际需要贷款过多，组里用以增加了不必要的开支有关。有的单干户手拿白馍，用筷子敲着饭碗挖苦收入少生活苦的社员说：“看，单干吃白馍。”弄得社员哭笑不得。
    也有一些组和社做到了多产粮食，并且使组员、社员得到了高于一般农民的实际收入。它们就大大地发挥了组员或社员的生产积极性，自然而然地成为引导广大农民前进的旗帜。
