Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd: About a month ago, the American metallurgical industry magazine "Steel" worriedly wrote: Since the demand for hot-rolled carbon strip steel, the most widely used, has decreased, the demand for most other types of steel will also decrease successively.

In the past month, the demand for scrap steel, like other types of steel, has decreased. The so-called "indicator" of steel industry activity—scrap steel prices—has generally declined throughout the country.

Since the outbreak of the Korean War, especially after the major steel strike last year, the US steel industry has relied on massive military production to achieve great success. The steel market has often been in a state of "shortage." In the words of the United Press, "Steel inventories are better than money in the bank."

However, the superficial "prosperity" of the steel industry began to show its artificially created weaknesses in the middle of this year. An important sign marking the end of the steel industry's "prosperity" period is the beginning of a downward trend in production. According to materials from the American Iron and Steel Institute, since the end of June, steel production has not been able to reach the weekly average level of the first half of the year. In the three weeks ending September 19, weekly steel production even dropped to the lowest record since September of last year. At the same time, the steel industry's production capacity has never been fully utilized since May of this year. In the three weeks ending September 19, the operating rate was around 90 percent. This means that at least 10 percent of the current US steel industry's production capacity is being idled.

American bourgeois newspapers admit that the reduction in steel production is not due to seasonal factors, but to a decrease in sales. "Steel" magazine wrote: There are currently five factors at play in consumer purchasing: "(1) The war emergency has gradually disappeared, (2) Steel production capacity has increased, (3) The demand for goods accumulated during World War II and the Korean War has been met, (4) The end of the Korean War has further increased the vigilance of entrepreneurs, (5) The 'pipelines' of steel distribution are being filled up." This means that with the disappearance of war stimulus, the shadow of an overproduction crisis has immediately appeared in the steel industry. The magazine pointed out that due to these factors, steel industry orders for the fourth quarter are decreasing.

The decline in steel industry activity also reflects the decline in other sectors of the US economy. The first is the largest manufacturing industry, the automobile industry. The automobile industry consumes about one-sixth to one-fifth of the total steel production annually. For the same reason, automobile production is shrinking, and the demand for steel is correspondingly decreasing. According to "Iron Age," the three largest automobile companies in the United States have been adjusting or preparing to shrink their steel procurement operations. Chrysler gradually canceled contracts for purchasing steel at high prices through intermediaries in August. Ford and General Motors are preparing to stop purchasing high-priced steel in October or November. At the same time, the construction industry, which accounts for about 17 percent of steel consumption, the container industry, which accounts for about 10 percent, and the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, which accounts for more than 4 percent, have successively reduced steel orders. According to the Associated Press, many consumers are currently ordering steel for a maximum of one month, instead of on a three-month basis as before, and some consumers are even canceling existing contracts.

American steel merchants hope that in the face of a shrinking domestic market, they can expand foreign markets to make up for the shortcomings of the domestic market, but they are encountering fierce competition from Western European steel merchants. According to the Associated Press, some Western European steel merchants have stepped up efforts to reduce prices, lowering the prices of several types of steel by 10 to 40 percent to counter the high prices of American steel. Some countries have also implemented import restrictions. According to the Associated Press, in the first four months of this year, US steel exports decreased by almost 30 percent compared with the same period last year.

### 美国钢铁生产下降  国内外市场日益萎缩

    美国钢铁生产下降
    国内外市场日益萎缩
    【新华社二十二日讯】纽约消息：大约在一个月以前，美国冶金业的杂志“钢铁”忧虑地写道：由于用途最广的热辗碳条钢的需求已在减少，其他各种钢铁的需求大部分也会相继减少。
    这一个月来，和其他几类钢铁一样，废钢的需求已经减少了。所谓钢铁业活动的“指标”——废钢价格——已在全国各地普遍下降。
    自从朝鲜战争爆发以后，特别在去年钢铁大罢工以后，美国钢铁业依靠巨大的军备生产在大走红运。钢铁市场经常处于“缺货”状态。用合众社的话说：“钢铁的存货比放在银行里的钱还要好些。”
    可是，钢铁业的这种表面“繁荣”在今年年中以来就开始显现它的人工制造的弱点。标志着钢铁工业“繁荣”时期的终结的重要迹象是生产开始出现下降趋势。根据美国钢铁研究所的材料，从六月底开始，钢铁生产量一直没有能够达到上半年每周平均的水平。到九月十九日为止的三个星期内，每周的钢铁生产量并且降低到去年九月以来的最低纪录。同时，钢铁工业的生产能力自今年五月以来也从来没有充分利用过。在九月十九日结束的三个星期内，开工率是百分之九十左右。这就是说，目前美国钢铁业的生产能力最少已有百分之十废置在一边。
    美国资产阶级报刊承认，钢铁生产的减少并不是由于季节性的影响，而是在于销路的减少。“钢铁”杂志写道：目前有五个因素正在消费者的购买中发生作用：“（一）战争紧急状态已逐渐消失，
  （二）钢铁生产能量已告增加，（三）在第二次世界大战及朝鲜战争中积累起来的对货物的需求已经得到满足，（四）朝鲜战争的结束使企业家的戒心更加增加，（五）钢铁分配的‘输送管’正在装得满满的。”这就是说，随着战争刺激的消失，钢铁业已立即显出生产过剩危机的暗影。该杂志指出，由于这些因素，钢铁业第四季的定货单正在减少。
    钢铁业活动的下降，也反映了美国经济中其他部门的衰落。首先是最大的制造工业汽车业。汽车业每年消费的钢铁大约占钢铁总产量六分之一至五分之一。由于同样的原因，汽车业的生产已在缩小中，对于钢铁的需求也就相应的减少。据“钢铁时代”透露，美国三家最大的汽车公司也已在调整或准备收缩它们的钢的采购业务。克莱斯特汽车公司在八月份已逐渐取消了用高价转一道手购买钢铁的合同。福特汽车公司与通用汽车公司已准备在十月或十一月间停止高价钢的购买。同时，在钢铁消费中的比重约占百分之十七的建筑业，约占百分之十的容器业以及约占百分之四以上的农业机器制造业已先后减少钢铁订货。据美联社的消息说，许多消费者目前订购钢铁最多是订购一个月，而不像以前以三个月为基础，一些消费者而且还在取消已订的合同。
    美国钢铁商指望，在国内市场日益萎缩的情况下，可以扩大国外市场来弥补国内市场的不足，但是却遇到西欧钢铁商激烈的竞争。据美联社的消息说，一些西欧的钢铁商已加紧采取减价的办法，把几类钢铁的价格减低百分之十至四十，以抵制价格高昂的美国钢铁。一些国家还实行了入口限制。据美联社说，在今年头四个月，美国钢铁出口比去年同期减少了差不多百分之三十。
