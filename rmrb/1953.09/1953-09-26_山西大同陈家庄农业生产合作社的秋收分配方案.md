Editor's Note: The Rural Work Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently circulated the autumn harvest distribution plan of the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Datong, Shanxi to various places in North China, requesting that they refer to this plan in light of their specific conditions and earnestly carry out the autumn harvest distribution work of agricultural production cooperatives. The distribution plan is now published below for reference.

The Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Datong County, Shanxi Province, formulated an autumn harvest distribution plan through democratic discussions in August, using the gap after the end of summer weeding, resolving the concerns of the members that "the harvest is high, but the distribution is low" and "the distribution is unfair." The specific plan is as follows:

(1) The principle of distribution is: reward labor, more work, more gain, and also take into account land benefits (the cooperative stipulates a fixed rent system). From the total income of the cooperative, after deducting land income, public accumulation fund, and this year's various production investments, the remainder is completely distributed as dividends based on labor days.

(2) Preparation methods for next year's feed, forage, and seeds: Feed: The cooperative will not deduct it first and will distribute it in the same way as other crops. Then, the cooperative will mobilize members to voluntarily invest according to the needs of all the cooperative's draft animals. In this way, members can consider how much to invest based on their family situation and how much grain they have left. Forage: In addition to the general straw being distributed to members for fuel, the cooperative will uniformly retain a portion of forage. This retained portion will be converted into grain or RMB based on how much each member should receive, as an investment by the members in the cooperative. Seeds: Those uniformly selected will no longer be distributed to the members. The same method as deducting forage will be used. These three items will accrue interest for the members, and be returned next autumn. Everyone believes that this method is better than uniformly deducting from the total income, because uniform deduction, first, deducts more from those who work more, and second, reduces the amount distributed to members, leading to dissatisfaction among members because "production increases, but dividends decrease."

(3) Distribution is based on millet as the conversion standard, and other grains are converted into millet according to local market prices. The distribution method is to distribute as you harvest, which has three benefits: first, it can solve the difficulty of having nowhere to store grain in the cooperative; second, it can save the labor of carrying it back and forth after threshing; and third, it can avoid losses during the process of warehousing and redistribution. However, distributing each time a field is harvested must be preceded by calculation. Before the autumn harvest, based on the good or bad growth of the crops, estimate the total harvest of the cooperative, roughly calculate how much each member's labor day will be paid, how much land income can be obtained, how much animal rent (cooperative rent for members' draft animals), repayment of seeds, feed, and depreciation of farm tools will be, and then distribute each time a field is harvested according to the preliminary estimated basis, and settle the final accounts after the harvest, compensating for shortages and returning surpluses. However, because the estimated production is an approximate figure, it is impossible to completely match the actual figure. If it is distributed completely according to the estimated production figures, it will inevitably cause the trouble of some receiving too much and others receiving too little, requiring some to return and others to supplement, which will cause dissatisfaction among the members. Therefore, when pre-distributing, regardless of the type of grain, first distribute 70% (70% is too low, it should be 80% or 90%), and the remaining grain will be temporarily stored in the cooperative as mobile grain for the final settlement to make up for shortages.

(4) The current living habits of the members are still "eat what you plant" and "eat what you harvest." Various grains should be matched well during distribution, especially the grains with small harvests in the cooperative. For example, although millet is one of the main food grains for the members, there is no fear of insufficient distribution because a lot is planted; mung beans, soybeans, and black beans are planted less, but they are not the main food grains of the members, so everyone has no opinion on whether more or less is distributed; only broomcorn millet, sorghum, and yams are three kinds of grains that are both the main food grains for the members and not planted too much this year, so the matching of grains is mainly these three kinds. In order to match these three kinds of grains well, according to last year's experience, the method of combining members' self-reporting based on family life with the cooperative's averaging based on total output (estimate before the autumn harvest, and then calculate the total accounts after the autumn harvest) is implemented. The problem of even distribution of grain quality is solved by the following three methods: 1. Match the crops from good land and bad land when threshing and thresh them together (Note: This also has shortcomings. Last year, some cooperatives separated good grain and bad grain first, and then matched them for distribution. This method can be used as a reference). 2. Mix the grains from the upwind and downwind sides of the threshing ground evenly before distribution. 3. Leave a small portion of particularly good (such as from high-yielding land) and particularly bad grains as public accumulation fund.

(5) In order to achieve fair and reasonable, simple and easy, and orderly distribution, when members receive grain, they first issue a slip from the accountant, and the accountant records the slip (two-part form). The members receive the grain from the field with the slip. The production team leader is responsible for collecting the slips and measuring the grain. After the distribution and measurement, the production team leader is responsible for handing over the remaining grain to the warehouse keeper. The warehouse keeper is responsible for storing and watching the grain. Finally, the accountant, the production team leader, and the warehouse keeper reconcile the accounts. During this series of distribution processes, the director of the cooperative is responsible for overall supervision and inspection.

Currently, the cooperative is actively preparing according to the distribution plan: 1. Settling the total accounts of land rent, production investment, and labor days for the entire cooperative. 2. Conducting production estimation and budgeting, estimating that each labor day this year (including labor days during the autumn harvest) can be divided into one *shi dou* of millet, equivalent to 7,000 yuan. 3. Each group is separately investigating and registering the grain demand of each member. 4. The administrator is responsible for preparing the warehouse for storing the remaining mobile grain, planning the *dou*, scales, pockets, ropes, etc. used for distribution, and printing the documents required for distribution.

    山西大同陈家庄农业生产合作社的秋收分配方案
    编者按：中共中央华北局农村工作部，最近把山西大同陈家庄农业生产合作社的秋收分配方案通报华北区各地，要求各地根据具体情况，参照这一方案，切实作好农业生产合作社的秋收分配工作。现将这一分配方案发表于后，供各地参考。
    山西省大同县陈家庄农业生产合作社，在八月间利用夏锄结束后的空隙，民主讨论订出了秋收分配方案，解决了社员怕“收的多，分的少”和“分不公”的顾虑。具体方案如下：
    （一）分配原则是：奖励劳动，多劳多得，并兼顾土地利益（该社规定是死租制）。从全社总收入中，除去土地收益、公积金、今年的各项生产投资外，其余完全按劳动日分红。
    （二）明年的饲料、饲草、籽种的准备办法：饲料：社内先不扣除，和其他作物一样分配后，社内再根据全社耕畜的需要量，发动社员自愿投资。这样，社员可根据家庭情况，剩粮多少，考虑投资多少。饲草：除一般秸草分给社员做燃料外，社内要统一留一部分饲草，这留的部分按每个社员应分多少，折成粮食或人民币，作为社员向社的投资。籽种：统一选的，不再分到社员手中，和扣饲草办法一样处理。这三项均给社员作息生利，明秋归还。这一办法，大家认为比从总收入中统一扣除好，因为统一扣除，第一是劳动多的扣除的多，第二社员分得少了，以致社员因“增产多，分红少”而不满。
    （三）分配以谷子为折合标准，其他粮种均按当地市价折成谷子计算。分配方法是随打随分，这有三种好处：第一、可解决社内粮食没处放的困难；第二、可省打场后扛来扛去的工；第三、可避免因入仓再分过程中的损耗。但打一场分一场，必须先有计算，在秋收前按庄稼生长好坏，估计出全社的收获量，大体算出每个社员劳动日分红多少，可得土地收益多少，畜租（社租用社员耕畜）、归还籽种、饲料、农具折旧费等各多少，然后按照初步估计出的底子，打一场分一场，打完后算一次总账，长退短补。不过由于估产是个大概数字，不可能和实际数字完全符合，完全按照估产数字分了，势必产生分多分少你退他补的麻烦，分多的再叫退出，便会引起社员不满。为此，在预分时无论什么粮种均先按七成分出（按七成太低，应按八成或九成分），剩下的粮食社内暂时保存下来，作为机动粮，最后结算时做短补之用。
    （四）社员目前生活习惯还是“吃啥种啥”“收啥吃啥”，分配时各种粮食要配搭好，特别是社内收获量较少的粮种要配搭好。如谷子虽系社员主要食品粮之一，但因种的多，不怕不敷分配；绿豆、黄豆、黑豆等虽种的少，但不是社员主要食品粮，分多分少大家没意见；唯有黍子、高粱、山药蛋等三种粮，既系社员的主要食品粮，今年又种的不太多，所以粮种配搭主要是这三种。为把这三种粮配搭好，根据去年经验，实行社员根据家庭生活自报与社内根据总产量平均（秋收前根据估产，秋收后再算总账）相结合办法配搭。粮食质量的配搭均匀问题，用以下三种办法解决：一、打场时把好地和坏地的庄稼配搭开，打在一起（按：这样做也有缺点，去年有些社是先把好粮和坏粮分开打，然后配搭分配。这办法可作参考）。二、扬场后把上风头和下风头的粮食掺合均匀再分。三、把一小部分特别好（如丰产地）和特别坏的粮食留作公积金。
    （五）为做到既公平合理，又简单省事，有头有绪地分配，社员领粮时先从会计手里开出条子，会计凭存根下账（两联单），社员凭条到场里领粮。场里由生产队长负责收条过斗。分配过斗后，生产队长再负责将剩余粮食交给保管员。保管员负责入库看粮。最后会计、生产队长、保管员三人接头对账。在这一系列的分配过程中，社长负责全面的督促检查。
    目前社里正在按照分配方案，积极进行准备工作：一、结清全社地租、生产投资、劳动日的总账。二、进行了估产预算，预计今年每个劳动日（连秋收时劳动日在内）可分谷子一市斗，折钱七千元。三、各小组正分别调查登记各个社员的粮种需求情况。四、管理员正负责准备存放剩余机动粮的仓库，筹划分配时所用的斗、枰、口袋、绳子等及印制分配需用的单据。
