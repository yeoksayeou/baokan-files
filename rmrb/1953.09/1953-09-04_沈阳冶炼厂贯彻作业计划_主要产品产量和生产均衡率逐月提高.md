    Shenyang Smelter Implements Production Schedules
    Output of Major Products and Production Equilibrium Rate Increase Month by Month
    Since mid-April, the Shenyang Smelter has further strengthened its planning management with the implementation of production schedules as the core. The output of various major products and the production equilibrium rate have increased month by month, reversing some of the past confusion in production management and further improving the management level on the original basis. In July, the output of electrolytic copper exceeded the plan by 6.4 percent; the output of electrolytic zinc exceeded the plan by 22 percent; and the output of electrolytic lead in July was higher than in April, May, and June. The production equilibrium rate of major products has also greatly improved. In July, electrolytic zinc production met the daily plan for twenty-eight days; electrolytic lead met or exceeded the daily plan for fifteen out of seventeen days; and the production equilibrium rate of electrolytic copper was also above 95 percent.
    The factory's production is characterized by collective operation, and the work results of one shift can only be reflected at one point. In addition, the equipment is relatively old, so some people believe that it is difficult to ensure balanced production. However, after strengthening planning management, it shows that the main problem is not objective, but that production management lacks thorough planning and preparation before production is inadequate, so shutdowns often occur. After May, they further specified the production schedule, implemented production according to groups and daily plans, and formulated instruction charts for groups and shifts. Each shift in each group established a system of pre-shift planning and post-shift summary. As a result, many workshops and groups quickly changed the situation of being loose in the front and tight in the back, and the production equilibrium rate increased significantly. For example, the equilibrium rate of electrolytic lead production reached 99.89 percent in June; and the equilibrium rate of electrolytic zinc increased to 99.92 percent in June. In July, while continuing to improve the production schedule, the factory also paid attention to strengthening dispatching work, making the content of the production schedule more complete and enriching it, and solving many problems that were discovered in advance that might affect balanced production. Every two hours, the dispatching room uses special telephones to check the production situation of each workshop and group, and promptly solves and deals with temporary problems. In the past, the lead electrolysis molten lead shift and the electrolysis shift often quarreled over crane usage. Workers from both shifts constantly initiated "voluntary labor" (workers automatically worked in their spare time to complete tasks within eight hours if the work wasn't finished), and production was also unbalanced. For this reason, workers requested the leadership to add a crane. However, since establishing dispatching work and conducting timely inspections according to the instruction chart, the two shifts have used the crane alternately with a certain amount of time, so the original crane was sufficient, "voluntary labor" was eliminated, and balanced production was guaranteed.
    Due to the strengthening of production planning, it has also created conditions for improving technology. For example, one of the three major technical problems to be solved in the zinc electrolysis workshop this year—the problem of improving current efficiency—after further strengthening planning management in July, the previous section ensured that the next section was supplied with raw materials of a certain specification and quantity according to the plan (for example, in order to ensure that the neutralization section completed the production of leachate on time, the purification section prepared containers in advance to store the leachate for the neutralization section according to the plan), thereby ensuring the implementation of the technical measures plan. The current efficiency increased from 83 percent to 90 percent, and the cost of electrolytic zinc also decreased.
    In the process of implementing the production schedule, workers have increased their sense of overall awareness and the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, which is inseparable from the Party's propaganda and education.

### 沈阳冶炼厂贯彻作业计划  主要产品产量和生产均衡率逐月提高

    沈阳冶炼厂贯彻作业计划
    主要产品产量和生产均衡率逐月提高
    沈阳冶炼厂从四月中旬起，进一步以贯彻作业计划为中心加强计划管理后，各种主要产品的产量和生产均衡率逐月提高，扭转了过去生产管理上的某些混乱状况，在原有的基础上进一步提高了管理水平。七月份电铜产量超过计划百分之六点四；电锌产量超过百分之二十二；电铅的产量七月份比四月、五月和六月份都有提高。主要产品的生产均衡率也大大提高，七月份电锌生产有二十八天按日完成了计划；电铅在十七天当中有十五天完成或超额完成了日计划；电铜的生产均衡率也在百分之九十五以上。
    该厂的生产特点是集体操作，一班的工作成绩只能体现在一点上，再加设备比较陈旧，因此有人认为要保证均衡生产很难。但加强计划管理以后，说明主要问题不在客观上，而是生产管理上缺乏周密的计划，生产前的准备工作不好，所以往往发生停工现象。五月份以后，他们又把作业计划具体化，实行按小组按日计划进行生产，制订了小组和各班的指示图表，每个小组里的每班都建立了班前计划、班后总结的制度。这样，许多车间和小组很快便改变了前松后紧的情况，生产均衡率显著提高。如电铅的生产六月份的均衡率达到百分之九十九点八九的水平；电锌的均衡率六月份更提高到百分之九十九点九二。七月份，该厂在继续健全作业计划的同时，又注意加强了调度工作，使作业计划的内容更加完整和充实，并解决了许多预先发现的可能影响均衡生产的问题。每隔两小时，调度室便用特备的电话检查各车间、小组的生产情况，及时解决和处理临时发生的问题。铅电解熔铅班与电解班过去时常因为争吊车吵闹，两班工人不断发起“义务劳动”（八小时内工作干不完，工人为了完成任务自动在业余时间干），生产也不均衡，为此工人曾要求领导上给增设一台吊车。但从建立调度工作按指示图表及时进行检查以后，两班工人交错使用吊车，有了一定时间，这样原有的吊车就够用了，“义务劳动”也消灭了，同时保证了生产的均衡。
    由于生产计划性的加强，也给改进技术创造了条件。如锌电解车间今年要解决的三大技术问题之一——提高电流效率问题，在七月份进一步加强计划管理以后，上一工段保证按计划供给下一工段一定规格和一定数量的原料（比如净液工段为了使中和工段按时完成浸出液的生产任务，便按计划提前给中和工段准备好容器贮藏浸出液），因而保证了技术措施计划的实现，电流效率由百分之八十三提高到百分之九十，电锌的成本也降低了。
    该厂在贯彻作业计划当中，工人们增加了整体观念和团结互助的精神，这是和党的宣传教育分不开的。
