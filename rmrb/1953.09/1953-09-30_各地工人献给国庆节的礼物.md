Workers in Tangshan Steel Plant's Rolling Mill Department Create Automatic Steel Feeder
    Workers in the Rolling Mill Department of Tangshan Steel Plant created an automatic steel feeder as a gift to celebrate National Day.
    In the past, sending steel bars from the medium rolling mill to the small rolling mill relied entirely on manual labor. As soon as the steel bar came out of the medium rolling mill, the workers had to quickly grab it with tongs and run with it. If they were not careful, they would trip and be burned by the steel bar. The work was also hot and tiring. Product quality was also low, and a slight oversight could lead to defects.
    In February of this year, the factory sent a technical delegation to Anshan Iron and Steel Company to visit and learn about mechanization. Everyone saw the benefits of the automatic steel feeder firsthand. After returning to the factory, everyone formulated a plan based on the specific conditions of the factory. First, they promoted two types of retaining disks. After more than three months of efforts, the automatic steel feeder was finally successfully manufactured.

Ma Wencai Team Completes Annual Drilling Task Ahead of Schedule
    The Ma Wencai drilling team of the Geological Drilling Company of Jilin Jiaohe Mining Bureau, on the condition of ensuring quality, reducing costs, and safe drilling, completed the annual drilling task one hundred and twelve days ahead of schedule on September 10. The team's overall average coal core recovery rate reached 66.8%, and the rock core recovery rate reached 82.5%. Unit costs were reduced by 28.7% according to plan. The actual efficiency was 23.59 meters, and the overall average daily progress efficiency was 754 meters. The Ma Wencai team is now working hard to exceed the annual plan by 50%.

Jingxi Mining Bureau Drilling Team Completes Third Quarter Plan Ahead of Schedule
    The state-owned Jingxi Mining Bureau Drilling Engineering Team comprehensively completed the third quarter national plan nine days ahead of schedule. The average coal core recovery rate reached 65.5%, and the rock core recovery rate averaged 86%, both exceeding national regulations. Costs were reduced by 12.6% compared to the national plan. National regulations were met for safe operations and ensuring pure drilling time.
    Currently, the drilling team is deeply engaged in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. In addition to ensuring the recovery of losses from the first half of the year, they are also ensuring the comprehensive completion of the 1953 national plan fifteen days ahead of schedule. The staff of various departments have also proposed to cooperate with the workers in completing the plan and have launched a competition to improve work efficiency.

Tong Xincheng Team Guarantees 1,150 Days of Safe Operation
    The Tong Xincheng team of the Turbine Workshop of the First Power Plant of Wuhan Metallurgy and Electricity Bureau created a new record of 1,150 days of safe operation in the Central South region. The entire team recently wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, promising to guarantee 1,500 days of safe operation to welcome National Day. The letter stated: The factory's rotating machinery relies on us to supply electricity, and the lighting of every household also depends on our power generation, so safe operation is our greatest responsibility. The letter concluded: "We have the confidence to assure you that we will welcome National Day with the practical action of completing 1,500 days of safe operation."

Wuzhou Hydropower Plant Exceeds Profit Delivery Plan for First Three Quarters
    The Guangxi Wuzhou Hydropower Plant has already exceeded its profit delivery plan for the first three quarters of this year as a gift to celebrate National Day.
    The plant's profit delivery task this year increased by 80.15% compared to the 1952 delivery plan, and increased by more than 71% compared to the actual delivery figure in 1950, the first year after liberation.
    Currently, all employees of the plant are continuing to expand the number of electricity and water users, and are working hard to reduce coal consumption, electricity consumption, and water consumption, striving to contribute more profits to the first National Day of the country's first Five-Year Plan.

Lanzhou Auto Parts Manufacturing Plant Guarantees Completion of September Production Task
    All employees of the state-owned Lanzhou Auto Parts Manufacturing Plant proposed to take practical action by improving production competitions and completing the September production task to welcome National Day.
    At the end of August, all employees discussed the specific plan for celebrating National Day by engaging in production competitions in groups. The milling and shaping group proposed: Tools should be prepared before work to avoid taking them temporarily and delaying time; the second turning group proposed: Strive to exceed the September production task by more than 20% by improving technical operations, and ensure that raw materials are not wasted and that the quality meets standards; the foundry proposed: Ensure timely supply of blanks to the machine shop. After the discussion, concrete methods proposed by each workshop, such as comparing output, comparing quality, observing labor discipline, ensuring safety, and cherishing public property, were used as competition conditions. Now, all workshops and groups are full of confidence, proposing challenges to competition conditions, guaranteeing to complete the September production task to welcome National Day.

    各地工人献给国庆节的礼物
    唐山钢厂轧钢部创造了自动送钢机
    唐山钢厂轧钢部职工创造了自动送钢机，作为向国庆节的献礼。
    过去，从中型轧钢机往小型轧钢机送钢条时，完全靠人力操作，工人们一等钢条从中型轧钢机里跑出来，就得手急眼快地用钳子把它夹住，并且很快地跟着它一起往前跑，若是一不留神，就会绊倒被钢条烫伤；平时干起活来，也是又烤又累。产品质量也很低，稍有一点疏忽，就要出废品。
    今年二月，该厂派出技术参观团到鞍山钢铁公司参观和学习了机械化的经验，大家亲眼看到了自动送钢机的好处。回厂后，大家就根据本厂的具体情况制订了计划，首先推广了正反两种围盘，经过三个多月的努力，自动送钢机终于制造成功了。
    马文财小组提前完成全年钻探任务
    吉林蛟河矿务局地质钻探公司马文财钻探小组，在保证质量、降低成本、和安全钻进的条件下，于九月十日提前一百一十二天完成了全年钻探任务。该组总平均煤芯采取率达到百分之六十六点八，岩芯采取率达到百分之八十二点五；单位成本按计划降低了百分之二十八点七。实际效率二十三点五九公尺，总平均日进效率是七百五十四公尺。现在马文财小组正努力争取超过全年计划百分之五十。
    京西矿务局钻探队提前完成第三季度计划
    国营京西矿务局钻探工程队提前九天全面地完成了第三季度国家计划，煤芯的采取率平均达到百分之六十五点五；岩芯采取率平均达到百分之八十六，都超过了国家的规定。成本比国家计划降低百分之十二点六，在安全作业和保证纯钻进时间上都达到了国家规定。
    现在，钻探队正深入地开展增产节约竞赛，除保证弥补上半年亏损外，并保证提前十五天全面完成一九五三年国家计划。各科室的职员也提出配合工人完成计划，展开了提高工作效率的竞赛。
