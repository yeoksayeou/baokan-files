Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 25th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech on the Indian government's foreign policy in the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) of the Indian Parliament on September 23rd. When mentioning the Korean issue, Nehru said that the Korean issue "is perhaps the most important issue in the entire world today." Nehru said that the current problem is "how the Korean political conference should be composed." Nehru listed the issues to be discussed at the political conference—the issue of prisoners of war, the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and the issue of peacefully resolving the Korean issue. He then said, "All these issues prompt us to discuss the entire Far East issue, and the Far East issue is a very large issue. … Only after discussing and resolving these first few issues can the Far East issue be resolved peacefully.” Nehru said: “Now, the problem facing the United Nations is to organize this conference. People may think that this problem is not a very difficult one, because at such a conference, resolutions are not passed by voting—a majority vote. To pass a resolution, everyone must agree. Whether there are extra people—one, two, or three—sitting around the table doesn't matter much. But this kind of argument has happened before, and behind this argument, there are different ways to solve the problem. These different methods are often cited by those who talk about round table conferences and square table conferences. What kind of table conference is held doesn't matter much. What matters is the way to solve the problem." Nehru said, "The United Nations has passed a resolution—this resolution was passed by the Political Committee at the last meeting—this resolution more or less stipulates that only the belligerent parties should participate in this conference. On the other hand, it has also been proposed that some neutral countries should participate in this conference. China and North Korea have particularly emphasized this point, and even put forward the names of several neutral countries to participate in this conference. Therefore, the question before the United Nations is: Should the United Nations add some countries other than the belligerent countries to attend this political conference?"

After stating India's position, Nehru said, "Our country has been nominated, and we have made it clear that we do not desire to participate in the conference. Of course, we do not think that India must participate in the conference, but we believe that if some neutral countries other than the belligerent parties participate, it may help the cause of peace." Nehru said: "However, in these issues (which are undoubtedly of world importance and therefore every country in the world has the right to express concern), for geographical and other reasons, many issues are related to the Asian part; in my opinion, it is inappropriate to greatly ignore Asia when dealing with issues concerning Asia and occurring in Asia. In my opinion, this is the wrong approach, and this approach will become increasingly ineffective over time. Even now, this approach has become quite difficult; and tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, it will become even more difficult, and finally it will be impossible. It is inappropriate to think that the major problems of Asia can be arbitrarily disposed of at present, as if Asian countries do not matter."

When talking about the relationship between Asia and the world, Nehru said that most people in Europe and the Americas may not yet know about the development of Asia, "Because, if they fully knew about this development, why would they repeatedly forget Asia and assume that they can solve the problems of Asia at domestic conference tables, at small or large meetings, without consulting the Asians? Obviously, anyone who puts a little thought into this issue will understand that they cannot deal with the problems of Asia or any part of Asia without the goodwill and cooperation of Asia."

Nehru condemned the United Nations for allowing the Kuomintang bandit gang to usurp the permanent seat on the Security Council and allowing it to represent Asia. Nehru pointed out that the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gang "is wrongly called China; obviously, it can be called whatever you want, but it is not China." Nehru said: "Any world organization that does not take Asia into account or only regards Asia as a political strategy or a battleground for their conflicts will inevitably become increasingly unworkable in the future. Asia will certainly not be willing to endure this treatment."

    尼赫鲁重申中立国应参加政治会议的主张
    【新华社新德里二十五日电】印度总理尼赫鲁于九月二十三日在印度国会联邦院就印度政府的外交政策发表演说。尼赫鲁在提到朝鲜问题时说，朝鲜问题“也许是目前整个世界中最重要的问题”。尼赫鲁说，现在的问题是“朝鲜政治会议应该如何组成”。尼赫鲁列举了政治会议所将要讨论的问题——战俘问题、外国军队撤出朝鲜问题、和平解决朝鲜问题，接着说，“所有这些问题都促使我们讨论整个远东问题，而远东问题是一个非常大的问题。……而只有在把这头几个问题加以讨论并解决以后，才可能和平解决远东问题。”尼赫鲁说：“现在，摆在联合国面前的问题是组织这个会议。人们也许会认为这个问题并不是一个非常困难的问题，因为在这样一种会议上，不以投票——大多数票——方式通过决议。要通过决议必须大家一致同意。是否有额外的人——一个，两个或三个——坐在圆桌旁边，那并无多大关系。但是以前曾发生过这种争论，而在这种争论背后存在着不同的解决这个问题的办法，这些不同的办法是那些谈到圆桌会议和方桌会议的人所时常引用的。举行什么桌会议是并无多大关系的。而重要的是解决这个问题的办法。”尼赫鲁说：“联合国曾通过决议——这个决议是政治委员会在上次会议通过的，——这个决议或多或少等于是规定仅限于双方交战的方面参加这次会议。另一方面，也曾有人提出应该有一些中立国家参加这次会议，中国和北朝鲜方面曾特别强调这一点，甚至于提出了若干参加这次会议的中立国家的名字。因此，摆在联合国面前的问题就是：联合国是否应该除了交战国家之外再加添一些国家出席这次政治会议。”
    尼赫鲁在申述了印度的立场以后说，“我们国家被提名了，而我们曾明白表示我们并不渴望参加会议。当然，我们并不认为印度一定应该参加会议，而是认为如果除了交战方面而另外有一些中立国家参加会议的话，可能有助于和平事业。”尼赫鲁说：“然而在这些问题中（这些问题毫无疑问是具有世界重要性的，因而是世界上每个国家都有权表示关切的）由于在地理上和其他方面的原因，有许多问题是和亚洲部分有关的；在我看来，在处理关涉到亚洲和在亚洲发生的问题时反而大大地忽视亚洲，这是不适宜的。在我看来，这是错误的做法，这种做法随着时间的推移将愈来愈不济事。甚至在现在，这种做法已变得相当困难了；而在明天和后天，它就会变得更加困难，最后就会是行不通的。如果以为亚洲的重大问题在目前可以任意处置，好像亚洲国家算不了什么，那是不适当的。”
    尼赫鲁在谈到亚洲与世界的关系时说，欧洲和美洲的大多数人或许还不知道亚洲的发展，“因为，如果他们充分知道这个发展，为什么他们会一再忘记亚洲，而设想他们能够不征求亚洲人的意见就可以在国内的会议桌上、在小的或大的会议上解决亚洲的问题？显然，任何人只要对这个问题稍微用一点脑筋就会明白，他们若没有亚洲的善意和合作，是无法处理亚洲或亚洲的任何一部分的问题的”。
    尼赫鲁谴责联合国容许国民党匪帮窃据安全理事会常任理事国的席位，并且容许由它来代表亚洲。尼赫鲁指出，台湾国民党匪帮“被错误地称为中国，显然不管把它称为什么都可以，但是它不是中国”。尼赫鲁说：“任何世界组织如果不考虑到亚洲或是只把亚洲视如它们的政治策略或是它们的冲突的争逐场，那么这个组织将来一定会越走越走不通。亚洲必然不会甘心忍受这种待遇。”
