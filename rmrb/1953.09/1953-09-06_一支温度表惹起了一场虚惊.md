    A Thermometer Causes a False Alarm
    Ding Jianfan

    Inspector Lao Zhang from the Kuishan Coal Mine took a broken thermometer to the Ventilation Section to report to Section Chief Li: "This thermometer is broken!" Section Chief Li looked at it, then took a new one and personally went down the mine with the trainee Xiao Xia to inspect the airflow and wind speed, and measure the temperature.

    Upon arriving at the 703 heading, Xiao Xia took a temperature reading, and the temperature at the heading was as high as 27 degrees. Section Chief Li was somewhat suspicious and personally took the thermometer to another location to test it. The result reached 29 degrees. At this point, Section Chief Li became alarmed, because the temperature underground could not exceed 25 degrees, as stipulated by the safety regulations. Therefore, he immediately organized personnel to seal the air vents, install air doors, control the airflow, and increase the fan speed to improve ventilation and lower the temperature. Several days passed, and all this work was completed, but the temperature still did not decrease. Section Chief Li was extremely worried, and the mine director did not know what to do, and they were both in a panic.

    When the engineers and inspection section chief from the Zibo Mining Bureau heard about this, they personally came to inspect. After the inspection, they still could not find the cause and had no results, and they went up the mine with worried faces. But the engineer had some experience—he became suspicious of the thermometer. After going up the mine, he put the thermometer in his mouth to test it. When he took it out, the mercury was climbing to 40 degrees. He said with satisfaction, "It's really strange! I'm not sick, my diet hasn't decreased, how could my body temperature be so high?" One sentence revealed the reason, making everyone laugh and cry. It turned out that the thermometer was broken. Due to lax inspection, the defective product was accepted as a good product, and the ventilation section did not calibrate it when they received it. Section Chief Li said: "Anyway, a careless person is bound to suffer!" (Originally published in Shandong Dazhong Daily)

### 一支温度表惹起了一场虚惊

    一支温度表惹起了一场虚惊
    丁建藩
    奎山煤矿检查员老张拿着一支坏温度表跑到通风科报告李科长：“这支温度表砸坏了！”李科长看了看就又拿了一支新的，并且亲自同练习生小夏下井检查风流、风速，测量温度。
    到了七○三迎头，小夏拿温度表一测量，迎头温度高达二十七度。李科长心里有些怀疑，亲自拿了温度表到另一个地方试，结果竟达到了二十九度。这一下，李科长可着了慌，因为井下温度不得超过二十五度，这是保安规程规定的。于是立即组织力量密闭风口，安装风门，控制风量，加大扇风机转数来改善通风，降低温度。几天过去了，这些工作都做完了，可是温度还是不见降低。李科长心里急得慌，矿长也不知用啥办法好，都急做一团。
    淄博矿务局工程师、检查科长听说，也亲自来检查。检查后仍找不出原因，没个结果，愁眉苦脸地上了井。但工程师究竟有些经验——他对温度表发生了怀疑，上井后就把温度表含在口中试验，抽出来时，水银标正爬在四十度上。他满意地说：“真怪！我没有病，饮食没减少，怎么体温这么高？”一句话就道出了原因，说得大家哭笑不得。原来这支温度表是坏的，由于验收不严，把坏货当作好货收下了，通风科领用时也没校正。李科长说：“反正粗枝大叶的人，是要吃苦头的！”（原载山东大众日报）
