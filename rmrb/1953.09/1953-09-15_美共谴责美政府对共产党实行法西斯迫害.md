Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 11th (TASS): The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement to the press, vehemently criticizing the FBI's police actions, and calling on the American people to repel all attempts to forcibly implement fascism in the United States.

The National Committee's statement, referring to Attorney General Brownell's recent remarks that the Communist Party has now gone "underground," solemnly pointed out that this talk is a "despicable fascist lie and conspiracy." The statement said that the Communist Party of the United States is "an open and legal party engaged in open activities."

The statement condemned the FBI's agents for parking cars outside the headquarters of people's organizations, offices, and meeting places, attempting to photograph people entering and leaving, and using recorders to record people's conversations for the purpose of informing the police and carrying out persecution.

The statement said: "When people are unwilling to be photographed or have their conversations recorded and put into the FBI's files, and go to private rooms free from police state investigation to hold meetings—to exercise their constitutional and democratic rights of freedom of assembly and freedom of speech—this is called 'going underground.'..."

The statement continued: "It is necessary to vigorously repel the attempts to forcibly implement fascism in our country... It is necessary to abolish America's secret political police."

    美共谴责美政府对共产党实行法西斯迫害
   【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约十一日讯：美国共产党全国委员会对报界发表了一篇声明，猛烈抨击联邦调查局的警察行为。并号召美国人民击退强制在美国实行法西斯主义的一切企图。
    全国委员会的声明在提到司法部长布朗纳尔最近发表的所谓共产党现在已转入“地下”的谈话时郑重指出，这个谈话是一个“可鄙的法西斯谎言和阴谋”。声明说，美国共产党是“一个从事公开活动的公开的合法的党”。
    声明谴责联邦调查局的特务乘坐汽车停留在人民团体的总部、办公处门外和开会的地方，企图拍摄进出的人们的照片，并用录音器录取人们的谈话，好向警察告密和进行迫害。
    声明说：“当人们不愿被拍照或记录他们谈话来放进联邦调查局的档案里去，而到不受警察国家侦查的私室里开会——以执行他们的集会自由和言论自由的宪法和民主权利——时，这就被叫做‘转入地下’。……”
    声明继续说：“必要的是，大力击退强制对我国实行法西斯主义的企图……必要的是，取消美国的秘密政治警察。”
