Letter from E Qinglin, Director of the Suzigou Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin:
    Increase Production and Practice Economy to Overcome Natural Disasters
    E Qinglin from Suzigou Village, Eighth District, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, writes: I am the Party Branch Secretary of Suzigou Village and the Director of the village's Agricultural Production Cooperative. Last year, under the leadership of the Party, our cooperative overcame many difficulties such as empty reserves, few livestock, and insufficient labor, and completed the production increase task, earning the title of Special-Class Model Cooperative in Jilin Province. This year, the cooperative has expanded to thirty households, one hundred and six people, and forty-eight hectares of land. Thanks to the members' active production, the crops are growing exceptionally well: the corn is as strong as my six-foot-tall stature, and you can't see people when you enter the cornfield; the beans also reach under the armpits, with each plant bearing seventy or eighty bean pods. The members are joyfully busy picking out large weeds and cutting the edges of the fields. Unexpectedly, on August 19th and 20th, it rained non-stop, the Songhua Lake water rose, and mountain water rushed down. The cooperative's land was on the verge of being completely flooded. At that time, under the call of the branch, the members braved the heavy rain to dig more than twenty zhang of trenches and build river embankments, protecting twenty-four hectares of land. Many members said: if we hadn't joined the cooperative, all the land would be gone, and we wouldn't get a single grain in the fall. Despite this, I am truly worried. To calculate the details, more than one hundred people are left with only twenty-four hectares of land, and we are short more than sixty shi of grain just for food. The day after the heavy rain stopped, several responsible comrades from the county braved the flood to come and understand the disaster situation, and discussed many ways to save ourselves through production. My confidence has increased, and the members' enthusiasm is even greater. All members have decided to ensure that no one is idle, no horse is idle, and everyone works together to increase production, practice economy, overcome difficulties, and conquer natural disasters. We have come up with the following specific measures:
    First, do a good job in the autumn harvest and strive not to waste a single grain. We have already leveled six large threshing grounds and repaired sixteen stone rollers. The harnesses and ropes have been checked twice, and every household's corn bins and grain storage have been repaired solidly. The members' meeting decided: harvest one piece as it ripens, achieving careful cutting, careful pulling, careful threshing, and harvesting, pulling, and threshing as we go, striving to bring every grain home. We are now organizing twelve women and some children to pick over the fields again after the crops have been pulled. We must select good seeds in the fields, and after the autumn harvest, autumn-plow 50% of the land in the entire cooperative to prepare for next year's production. In addition, the members must select good grain, cut it separately, pull it separately, thresh it separately, and prepare to pay the agricultural tax.
    Second, we must do a good job in sideline production during the hoeing break and after the autumn harvest. There are now twelve laborers forming a medicinal herb collecting team to go up the mountains to dig medicinal materials. On September 3rd, they dug seventy jin in one day (a contract has been signed with the supply and marketing cooperative, and each jin can be sold for 5,300 yuan). After the autumn harvest and before the snowfall, four people will be drawn to pull carts and transport yellow tobacco with three large carts and twelve livestock; the twenty-six male laborers at home will be divided into two teams to cut reed strips. After the snowfall and until we prepare for spring plowing next year, ten laborers will be organized to collect fallen timber (i.e., firewood), and four experienced male laborers will form a group to catch yellow weasels (i.e., trap yellow weasels), while the other sixteen male laborers will transport firewood to the city and make brooms. According to current estimates, the total income from sideline production during the hoeing break and in autumn and winter will be 54.8 million yuan.
    Third, educate members to practice economy. Everyone is encouraged to dry vegetables. Generally, each household has already dried thirty or forty jin, and it is planned that each household will dry one hundred to one hundred and fifty jin by autumn, and the entire cooperative can save two thousand jin of grain. When pushing corn, the flour in the residue should be sifted out, which is estimated to save two thousand jin of grain for the entire cooperative. Educate female members not to throw away leftover food, and pay attention to saving on the stove. The fourteen small livestock in the cooperative that are not yet in use will not be fed feed, but will eat corn stalks and bean pod skins, which can save one thousand four hundred jin of grain. The thirty-six pigs will not be fed grain, but will be fed the screenings left over from this year's threshing, which can save another three thousand jin of grain. In addition, members should also be educated to strive for frugality in life, especially after the autumn harvest and during the Spring Festival, not to eat and drink extravagantly. With these methods, the entire cooperative can save a total of ten thousand jin of grain.
    The above-mentioned measures for increasing production and practicing economy have been discussed two or three times by all members. Everyone actively supports them and has the confidence to complete them. In this way, adding together the income from sideline production and the grain saved, in addition to being able to make up for the shortage of food, we can also expand reproduction and support national economic construction.

    吉林蛟河县苏子沟村农业生产合作社主任俄青林来信
    增加生产厉行节约战胜自然灾害
    吉林省蛟河县八区苏子沟村俄青林来信：我是苏子沟村的党支部书记，又是这村农业生产合作社的主任。去年我们合作社在党的领导下，克服了家底空、牲口少、劳力不足等很多困难，完成了增产任务，得到了吉林省的特等模范社的称号。今年合作社扩大到三十户、一百零六口人、四十八垧地。由于社员们积极生产，庄稼长的格外新鲜：玉米壮实得像我这个六尺多高的大个子，进到玉米地里不见人；豆子也达到腋窝下，豆角每棵也有七、八十个。社员们喜气洋洋地忙着拣拔大草、割地边子。不料，八月十九、二十两天，大雨下个不停，松花湖水上涨，山水向下急流。合作社的土地眼看要全被水淹。当时在支部的号召下，社员们顶着大雨挖了二十多丈濠沟，修了河堤，保住了二十四垧地。许多社员都说：如果不入合作社，地就全没了，到秋一粒粮也得不着。虽然这样，可是我真有些犯愁。算个细账，一百多口人还剩二十四垧地，光吃的就缺六十多石粮食。大雨停后第二天，县上几个负责同志冒着大水赶来了解灾情，和我们研究了很多生产自救的办法。我的信心提高了，社员们的劲头也更大了。全体社员决定，要做到不闲一个人，不闲一匹马，一齐努力，增加生产，厉行节约，克服困难，战胜自然灾害。我们研究出了下面几项具体办法：
    第一，作好秋收工作，争取不糟践一粒粮。现在已经平好了六个大场院，修理好十六个石磙子，车马绳套都检查了两回，每家的玉米仓、粮囤子都修理得结结实实。社员大会决定：要熟一块割一块，作到细割、细拉、细打和随割、随拉、随打，争取颗粒还家。现在组织好十二名妇女和一些儿童，在拉完庄稼后再去拣一遍。要在地里选好种子，并在秋收后秋翻全社百分之五十的土地，给来年生产作准备。此外，社员还要挑好粮单割、单拉、单打，准备缴纳农业税。
    第二，要搞好挂锄期和秋收后的副业生产。现在有十二个劳力组成了一个采药队上山挖药材，在九月三日一天就挖了七十斤（已和供销社订好合同，每斤能卖五千三百元）。秋收后到落雪前，抽出四个人带三台大车、十二头牲口拉脚运黄烟；在家的二十六名男劳力分两队割笆条。落雪后到来年准备春耕，组织十个劳力拣陈材（即柴薪），由四个有经验的男劳力组成一个赶黄皮子（即捉黄鼠狼）小组，其他十六名男劳力一边向城里运柴火，一边打笤条。据现在估计，挂锄后和秋冬的副业总计能收入五千四百八十万元。
    第三，教育社员厉行节约。号召大家晒干菜，现在每户一般已晒出三、四十斤，计划到秋后每户晒好一百斤到一百五十斤，全社能省出二千斤粮食。在推玉米时要把渣子中的面子筛出来，这样全社估计能节省出二千斤粮食。教育女社员不扔剩菜剩饭，锅上锅下注意节省。社内十四个没上套的小牲口不喂料，吃玉米棵子和豆角皮子等，能省出一千四百斤粮食。三十六口猪不喂粮，喂今年打场留下的偏货，又能省出三千斤粮食。此外，还要教育社员在生活上力求节约，特别是秋收后和春节中不大吃大喝。用这些办法全社能一共节省出一万斤粮食。
    以上这些增产节约的办法，经全体社员讨论了两三次。大家都积极拥护，有信心完成。这样，把副业收入和节约出的粮食加在一起，除了能够补上缺的吃粮外，还能扩大再生产，支援国家经济建设。
