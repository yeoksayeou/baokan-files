    Central Nationalities Affairs Commission's Third (Enlarged) Meeting
    Basic Summary of Experiences in Promoting National Regional Autonomy
    (June 15, 1953)

    I. Basic Situation of Promoting National Regional Autonomy

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people of all nationalities in our country have entered a new historical period of people's democracy and national equality. Our country has become a big family of friendly cooperation among the people of all nationalities. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and with the help of the Han people, all minority nationalities have implemented Chairman Mao's policy of national regional autonomy, and have established or are preparing to establish various autonomous regions and autonomous organs that meet the necessary conditions. The implementation of the policy of national regional autonomy has enabled minority nationalities with certain areas of concentrated residence to realize their right to "be masters of their own affairs" in managing their own national affairs under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government and relevant higher-level people's governments, and to gradually enter the general orbit of new democracy from their current stage of development, thereby opening up broad avenues for their development and progress.

    Over the past three years, the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government have attached great importance to and have shown great concern for the promotion of the policy of national regional autonomy. The promulgation of the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" in August 1952 was a measure of great historical significance, providing a guideline for our country's work in promoting national regional autonomy.

    As of March 1953, forty-seven national autonomous regions at or above the county level had been established nationwide. These include the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which was established earliest and is the largest in scale; the relatively large Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region, Xikang Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, Yunnan Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, Jilin Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, Qinghai Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region, Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region, Suiyuan Ikezhao League Mongolian Autonomous Region, and Ulanqab League Mongolian Autonomous Region.

    Currently, the work of establishing national autonomous regions is still underway throughout the country. Many new national autonomous regions will be gradually established in the future. Preparatory institutions have already been established in Xinjiang Province, the Hui autonomous regions in Gansu and Ningxia, the Tibetan autonomous regions in Qinghai and Gansu, and the Mongolian autonomous regions in Ningxia and Qinghai. The national autonomous regions and their autonomous organs that have already been established will be further enriched and improved.

    Over the past three years, the work of promoting national regional autonomy has generally been healthy. Practice throughout the country has proven and continues to prove the superiority of the national regional autonomy system. It is indeed the key to solving our country's national question. The general and significant effects after the implementation of national regional autonomy are:

    (1) Enhanced patriotism, initiative, and spontaneity of the people of all nationalities. The abolition of the system of national oppression, the implementation of the policy of national equality, and especially the promotion of the policy of national regional autonomy, have enabled patriotism to develop and flourish among the minority nationalities. This is primarily manifested in their active participation in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and bandits, participating in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and participating in defending the motherland's borders. The people of all minority nationalities harbor heartfelt love and support for Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. They say, "In the past, we had no home. Now Chairman Mao has given us a home," "In the past, we couldn't win what we fought for. Chairman Mao gave it to us." They praise Chairman Mao as "the sun in winter" and "the rain in summer." The people of all national autonomous regions have shown great enthusiasm for how to manage and build their own "home," and their initiative and spontaneity have been unprecedentedly enhanced. Therefore, various tasks in the autonomous regions, whether it is resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production through patriotism, social security, or training cadres, can be carried out relatively smoothly and have generally achieved good results. Certain ethnic-minority-populated areas where work was previously considered difficult have become much easier to work in after the implementation of regional autonomy.

    (2) Strengthened unity between nationalities and within each nationality. In many areas, Han cadres and the masses have adopted an enthusiastic attitude of supporting and helping minority nationalities establish national autonomous regions, which has made the minority nationalities in each autonomous region increasingly enhance their friendship with the Han people and recognize the advanced and leading role of the Han people as the main nationality of China. The Tibetan people of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region call the local Han cadres and the People's Liberation Army "Gyaséba" (new Han people), and many minority nationalities appropriately refer to the Han people as "elder brother," which adequately illustrates this situation. The minority nationalities implementing regional autonomy are generally able to follow the example of the Han cadres and Han people in treating them, adopting a positive attitude of helping and actively caring for other minority nationalities within the autonomous region, thereby strengthening unity among the various nationalities within the autonomous region. The various localities, tribes, and religious sects within each nationality have also become more closely linked, their emotions have been communicated, most of those who "fought against each other" have achieved reconciliation, those who were originally divided and opposed are gradually moving towards unity and cooperation, and those who were originally united have become even closer due to the establishment of the autonomous region and the education of the people's government.

    (3) Close ties between autonomous organs and the people. After the establishment of the various national autonomous regions, a large number of patriotic intellectuals, activists, and leaders with ties to the people from minority nationalities have taken up work in the autonomous organs, and many have assumed leadership positions. Minority nationalities have said, "In the era of reactionary rule, people cursed us that pig bristles could not be made into felt, and savages could not be officials. Now Chairman Mao has come, and our people have become officials." In autonomous regions with national written languages, national written languages have gradually become tools for the autonomous organs to exercise their functions. The various facilities of the autonomous organs generally pay attention to the use of national forms and respect for national customs and habits, so that the local minority nationalities feel that the autonomous organs are familiar and approachable, and are indeed their own government, thereby closely linking the autonomous organs with the masses.

    (4) Gradual promotion of the political, economic, and cultural development of the various minority nationalities. After the establishment of the various national autonomous regions, due to the help of the higher-level people's governments, the unity of the people of all nationalities in the autonomous regions, and the improvement of their awareness, their political, economic, and cultural lives have generally made progress and development to varying degrees. Some of the national autonomous regions that were established earlier have seen more significant development and progress. Among them, the achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are particularly noteworthy. In the past, production in Inner Mongolia was very backward, but now it has greatly developed. In agriculture, the total grain output in 1952 exceeded the highest annual output before liberation by more than 25 percent. Livestock production has doubled compared to before the establishment of the autonomous region in 1947. Several modern industries have also begun construction within the autonomous region. Due to the development of production, the people's purchasing power is now more than three times higher than in 1948, and the people's lives have been significantly improved. In the past, very few people were literate. Now, not only have nearly 30,000 cadres of all nationalities been trained, but the number of children enrolled in school has also reached more than 60 percent of school-age children. In the past, diseases were rampant and the population was declining rapidly. Now, due to the development of health and medical work, the population has not only stopped declining but has also begun to increase. The above-mentioned achievements have made the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region reach a state of "thriving people and livestock" and prosperity, providing a good example of forward development for other national autonomous regions.

    II. Basic Experience in Promoting National Regional Autonomy

    Over the past three years, many experiences have been accumulated in the work of promoting national regional autonomy in various places. The most basic points are as follows:

    (1) It is essential to fully estimate the characteristics and specific circumstances of the various minority nationalities in all work. The situation of each minority nationality is extremely complex. Not only are they different from the Han people in terms of politics, economy, culture, religious beliefs, and customs, but the various minority nationalities are also different from each other. Even within a nationality, the situations in various tribes, religious sects, and agricultural and pastoral areas are often different or not completely the same. Therefore, for the work of each minority nationality, it is essential to start from the specific circumstances of each nationality, and it is essential to fully consider all the specific characteristics of each nationality, such as politics, economy, culture, and customs. When implementing the policy of regional autonomy, it is also essential to consider the specific conditions possessed by each concentrated nationality. Neither should the set of practices and experiences applicable to the Han areas be mechanically applied to the various minority nationalities areas, nor should the feasible methods and experiences of certain minority nationalities and national autonomous regions be mechanically applied to other minority nationalities and national autonomous regions. This should be given special attention in the work of promoting national regional autonomy and in the various tasks after the establishment of the national autonomous region. Article 31 of the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" stipulates that "The higher-level people's government shall sufficiently estimate the characteristics and specific circumstances of the current stage of development of each national autonomous region, so that its instructions and orders conform to the general path of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and are suitable for such characteristics and specific circumstances." Experience in various places has proven that those who act in accordance with the above-mentioned principles have achieved due success and have been supported by the minority nationalities. For example, the establishment of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region and the Qinghai Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region grasped the characteristics of these regions in terms of politics, economy, culture, and religion, called on all patriots to unite, implemented regional autonomy, and adopted the policy of uniting all leaders with ties to the people (including religious leaders), which broadly united the people of all strata around the autonomous region people's government, quickly stabilized social order, and successfully completed the work of establishing the autonomous region.

    Conversely, due to insufficient understanding of the characteristics of minority nationality societies and the erroneous mechanical application of the methods of land reform in the Han areas, discontent among the minority nationalities and even temporary chaos were caused in some areas, damaging the work of promoting national regional autonomy.

    Based on the current situation, the practice of mechanically transporting the experiences of the Han areas without regard to the characteristics and specific circumstances of the various minority nationalities is not an isolated phenomenon in individual areas, but a fairly common phenomenon in many areas. Some higher-level people's governments issue orders and instructions in a generalized manner without regard to the different situations of the autonomous regions, which also causes losses to the work of the autonomous regions. These situations should urgently attract the attention of the relevant areas to prevent and correct them.

    On the other hand, it should also be pointed out that while we should resolutely oppose the error of mechanically transporting the experiences of advanced nationalities and advanced areas without regard to the specific circumstances and historical conditions of the locality, there is no reason to oppose the appropriate application of the experiences of advanced nationalities and advanced areas in accordance with the specific circumstances and historical conditions of the locality. Article 34 of the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" stipulates that "The higher-level people's government shall use various appropriate methods to introduce the experiences and situations of advanced political, economic, and cultural construction to the people of all national autonomous regions." Experience has proven that appropriately learning from advanced experience and appropriately applying advanced experience in accordance with the specific circumstances and historical conditions of the locality is a necessary condition for the smooth progress and development of the various minority nationalities and the various national autonomous regions. The idea and practice of rejecting advanced experience and sticking to old ways are harmful to the progress and development of minority nationalities and national autonomous regions, and must also be appropriately persuaded and corrected.

    (2) It is essential to strengthen and consolidate unity between nationalities and within nationalities. This is a basic condition that must be possessed for the implementation of national regional autonomy, and it is also an important goal to be achieved by the implementation of national regional autonomy.

    Over the past three years, the abolition of the system of national oppression and the realization of the policy of national equality have united all nationalities in our country as never before. In some areas, the ethnic estrangement caused by the long history has been basically eliminated. However, in many areas, this estrangement still exists or has not yet been basically eliminated. The existence of Han chauvinism or the remnants of Han chauvinism is the main reason why ethnic estrangement has not been eliminated in many areas. Of course, the existence of narrow nationalism or the remnants of narrow nationalism among minority nationalities cannot be ignored, and great-nationality chauvinism among some minority nationalities that occupy the position of the majority nationality in certain areas cannot be ignored either, but on a national scale, Han chauvinism is the main danger in national relations at present.

    Strengthening education in patriotism and internationalism and strengthening education in national policies among all nationalities in accordance with the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and conducting self-criticism, are effective ways to overcome the tendency of great-nationality chauvinism and the tendency of narrow nationalism. At present, it is particularly necessary to educate and guide Han cadres and Han people to conduct self-criticism in order to overcome Han chauvinism or the remnants of Han chauvinism. The essence of Han chauvinism is the manifestation of bourgeois ideology in national relations. To overcome bourgeois ideology in national work, it is necessary to first overcome Han chauvinism in order to truly realize national equality and effectively help the various minority nationalities overcome all kinds of narrow nationalism. In the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region and other ethnic minority areas, because Han cadres first deeply reviewed and criticized the ideas and practices of Han chauvinism in the form of self-criticism, the minority nationality cadres were moved, and they also voluntarily criticized their narrow nationalist ideas and asked Han cadres to help them make progress. In this way, mutual trust between nationalities was further enhanced, and unity between nationalities was strengthened, thereby bringing new development to the work in the autonomous region. This experience is worth emulating in various places.

    Ethnic estrangement often prominently emerges in the process of establishing an autonomous region. For example, in some areas, some minority nationalities believe that the implementation of regional autonomy is to separate from the Han people and that they can do without the Han people. The Han people there also have concerns such as "fear of being bullied and fear of becoming a minority nationality," and some are even preparing to move. The other minority nationalities in the area are concerned that they may be discriminated against and treated unfairly by the nationalities implementing regional autonomy, and they also expressed doubts and anxieties. For this type of situation, the leading organs and leaders of the relevant areas must pay attention to it in advance, and in the preparatory stage of establishing the autonomous region, start with doing a good job in unity, fully respect the equal rights of all nationalities, educate the people with patriotism and internationalism, and actively eliminate the various misunderstandings and concerns existing among the people of the relevant nationalities regarding the implementation of regional autonomy. All important issues related to the establishment of the autonomous region should be fully consulted with the representatives of the various minority nationalities and the Han people, and their consent should be obtained before proceeding. By doing this, the process of establishing the autonomous region becomes a process of strengthening and consolidating national unity. Experience has proven that those autonomous regions that did so in the preparatory stage of their establishment strengthened friendly cooperation between nationalities, so that the work of establishing the autonomous region could be successfully completed, and laid the foundation for further strengthening national unity in the future; all those who did not do so were somewhat affected by the smooth establishment of the autonomous region. Experience has also proven that nationalities implementing regional autonomy are prone to neglecting the interests of other nationalities in the area. Therefore, nationalities implementing regional autonomy must always be vigilant about this shortcoming and often pay attention to respecting and taking care of the interests of other minority nationalities and Han people in the area. The other minority nationalities residing within the jurisdiction should be helped to establish their own autonomous regions as early as possible. Only in this way can we gain the trust of other nationalities in the autonomous region, strengthen and consolidate unity between nationalities, and promote the development of the construction cause of the autonomous region. Any ideas and practices that discriminate against other nationalities or do not respect the interests of other nationalities are wrong and must be prevented and overcome.

    In the work of promoting national regional autonomy, it is also necessary to make every effort to strengthen and consolidate unity within nationalities. This also requires vigorously carrying out unity work among the various tribes, regions, and religious sects within a nationality before the establishment of the autonomous region, conducting unity education for them, mediating their current disputes and conflicts, and making every effort to eliminate estrangement between them.

    On all major issues related to the establishment of the autonomous region, the interests of the above-mentioned aspects must be taken into account. It is necessary to call on them to respect each other, consult with each other, and unite well under the leadership of the higher-level people's government.

    In recent years, various places have done a lot of work in mediating internal disputes and promoting internal unity among nationalities, and have achieved great results, so that the long-term disunity and even antagonism formed within various minority nationalities in the past has gradually improved. However, strengthening unity between various regions, tribes, and religious sects within nationalities is still an important task in promoting regional autonomy and solving the national question, and various places must continue to work hard in accordance with different situations.

    Experience has proven that in order to do a good job in the unity between nationalities and the unity between the various tribes, regions, and religious sects within nationalities, it is necessary to pay attention to doing a good job in the work of the various leaders of the various minority nationalities who have ties with the people. They have a certain influence and prestige in their own nationalities. Doing a good job in their work greatly facilitates doing a good job in the work of the people. Therefore, all important issues related to the implementation of regional autonomy must be fully consulted with them and their consent obtained. In the preparatory institutions, autonomous organs, and other aspects of work, they should all have appropriate jobs, try to make each person use their talents and help them do their jobs well, and help them make progress. The leaders of the various minority nationalities should also respect the wishes of the people, respect the leadership of the higher-level people's government, and actively seek the help of Han cadres and strive to make progress.

    Driven by their aggressive ambitions, imperialists have tried every means to undermine the unity of the various nationalities in our country. The facts of the riots instigated by the remnants of the imperialists and their running dogs, Chiang Kai-shek, among the minority nationalities in some areas that have been exposed fully prove the enemy's conspiracy and crimes. Experience has proven that almost none of the riots in minority nationality areas are unrelated to the provocations of enemy agents and counter-revolutionaries, and almost none of them have succeeded because individual upper-level figures of the relevant minority nationalities were first deceived, allowing the enemy's conspiracy to succeed. This situation must arouse the high vigilance of the people of all minority nationalities and their leaders, and methods must be adopted to expose the enemy, punish counter-revolutionaries, and strengthen patriotic education among the people to deal with the enemy's sabotage.

    (3) It is essential to gradually nationalize the autonomous organs. This is an important link in strengthening and consolidating national unity and closely linking the autonomous organs with the people of all nationalities.

    According to the relevant articles of the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China," the nationalization of autonomous organs includes: making the personnel of the nationalities implementing regional autonomy the main component of the autonomous organs, and including an appropriate number of personnel from other minority nationalities and Han nationalities in the autonomous region; making the specific form of the autonomous organs conform to the wishes of the majority of the people of the nationalities implementing regional autonomy and the leaders who have ties with the people; making the autonomous organs adopt a national written language that is commonly used in their autonomous region as the main tool for exercising their functions, and simultaneously adopting the written language of the nationalities that do not use this written language when exercising their functions; making the autonomous organs pay attention to the use of national forms in their work.

    In general, the nationalization of autonomous organs includes three main issues: national cadres, national languages and written languages, and national forms. This is an issue that requires a long period of effort to completely resolve.

    Regarding the training of national cadres: After the establishment of the various autonomous regions, the training and growth of national cadres is relatively rapid. Now, each autonomous region already has a certain number of national cadres who have participated in the various tasks of the autonomous organs, and some have assumed leadership positions. Most of them have close ties with the local people, are familiar with the local situation, and have improved their political, cultural level, and working ability to a certain extent in the exercise of practical work. These achievements are inseparable from the care of the higher-level people's governments and the help of Han cadres. However, the training of national cadres within the autonomous regions is far from keeping up with the needs of the construction cause of the autonomous regions. The relevant higher-level people's governments must strengthen guidance and help the autonomous regions in the work of training cadres, and continue to train and promote cadres and talents suitable for various needs from among the patriotic intellectuals, mass activists, and leaders with ties to the people of minority nationalities. For this reason, it is necessary to examine and summarize experience, and overcome the shortcomings that exist in the work of training national cadres in accordance with the specific circumstances of each place.

    The establishment of the various autonomous regions and the development of the various construction causes within the autonomous regions depend on the unity and cooperation of Han cadres and minority nationality cadres. The Han cadres who participate in the work of the various autonomous regions mostly serve the minority nationalities with enthusiasm, and have played an important role in helping the autonomous regions train various national cadres, and have won the love of the minority nationality cadres, which is commendable. However, there are still some Han cadres who have bad habits such as not respecting the powers of national cadres and doing everything for them, which must be overcome and corrected in order to facilitate the training and growth of national cadres.

    Regarding national languages and written languages and national forms: The various higher-level people's governments must help the autonomous organs adopt a national written language that is commonly used in their autonomous region as the main tool for exercising their functions, and simultaneously adopt the written language of the nationalities that do not use this written language when exercising their functions. How to help those nationalities that do have a language that has become a national characteristic but do not have a written language to create a written language is both urgent and complex. It requires thorough investigation and research, separate formulation of feasible plans, and gradual implementation to obtain communication tools and develop national culture. At present, those who voluntarily learn Chinese or the written languages of other progressive nationalities should be actively helped, but there must be no coercion. Those nationalities that already use Chinese and Chinese has actually become their national common language should be actively helped to learn Chinese. Many minority nationalities have excellent cultural and artistic traditions, which should be appropriately promoted and helped to gradually absorb new content. In this regard, we have done very little work and need to pay attention to it. Due respect should be given to the customs and habits of minority nationalities, and attention should also be paid to the use of national forms in other aspects, such as the names of administrative units in the autonomous regions. Many autonomous regions have done a lot of work in respecting national languages and written languages and using national forms, and have achieved good results. In addition to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, the People's Government of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region formulated implementation measures for the development of national languages and written languages last year, and all administrative and financial organs have strengthened Tibetan translation cadres. The Han cadres in the autonomous region are learning Tibetan and Tibetan language, and all documents and propaganda materials are printed in both Tibetan and Chinese. Since February this year, all official documents have also used both Tibetan and Chinese, making Tibetan the main tool for the People's Government of the autonomous region to exercise its functions. Within these autonomous regions, national cadres are also enthusiastically learning Chinese, which should be welcomed. However, the leading organs in some places do not pay attention to or do not pay enough attention to the use of national languages and written languages and national forms. Some cadres in individual ethnic minority areas even insist that minority nationalities speak Chinese and wear Chinese clothes, and insist on replacing the dances of minority nationalities with Han-style Yangko dances, which are all extremely wrong. The issue of national forms is a major issue related to national rights and national development. Many of our tasks can only penetrate into the minority nationality masses through appropriate national forms. Each nationality has the freedom to maintain or reform its customs and habits and various national forms, but it must be based on the voluntary will of the majority of the people of each nationality and the leaders who have ties with the people, and no one may coerce them. Any coercion is wrong and impermissible. However, respecting national forms does not mean maintaining certain forms that are sufficient to hinder national progress and development and that the vast majority of the people and their leaders have already realized should be reformed, which should also be paid attention to.

    (4) It is essential to help the autonomous regions gradually exercise their autonomous rights. Under the unified system and plan of the state, all national autonomous regions enjoy autonomous rights commensurate with their administrative status in terms of politics, economy, finance, culture, education, and local people's armed forces. The correct exercise of these autonomous rights can give play to the great spontaneity of minority nationalities in different stages of development in handling internal affairs, and thus greatly benefit the political, economic, and cultural development of minority nationalities in the autonomous regions. The various autonomous rights of the autonomous regions are the rights of the minority nationality autonomous organs to manage the internal affairs of their own nationalities and to "be masters of their own affairs." Therefore, it is an extremely important issue. The correct exercise of this right not only requires the relevant higher-level people's governments to give due respect, but also requires the relevant higher-level people's governments to give necessary instructions and assistance. It now appears that most of the relevant higher-level people's governments have already made many efforts in this regard, but some relevant higher-level people's governments do not respect the autonomous rights of the various autonomous regions enough. Some individual higher-level people's governments do not even treat the national autonomous organs under their leadership, which are equivalent to special district-level organs, as a local government at the same level, and issue orders and arrange work directly to the lower-level governments under the leadership of the autonomous organs instead of through the autonomous organs. This practice is wrong. It harms the work of the autonomous regions and causes dissatisfaction among the people in the autonomous regions. They say, "Establish a government, establish a government (that is, establish an autonomous region), but everything remains the same." The relevant higher-level people's governments must examine and correct the above-mentioned wrong practices.

    We lack experience in the exercise of the autonomous rights of the autonomous regions, and we also lack the work of collecting and researching the existing experience. Therefore, various specific implementation methods still need to be further researched. We have now started this work, and we also hope that everyone will put forward opinions so that we can formulate a method as soon as possible.

    (5) It is essential to make every effort to develop political, economic, and cultural undertakings under possible conditions. This is one of the basic links in solving the national question. The implementation of regional autonomy is not equivalent to the fundamental solution of the national question. To fundamentally solve the national question, it is necessary to actively help the people of minority nationalities develop their politics, economy, and culture in accordance with possible conditions so that they can gradually reach the level of advanced nationalities. Therefore, the autonomous regions must attach importance to the development of politics, economy, and culture at the beginning of their establishment and after their establishment. In the preparatory stage of establishing the autonomous region, when dealing with the ethnic composition and regional boundaries of the autonomous region, it is necessary to give special consideration to the development conditions of the various nationalities in the autonomous region, especially the nationalities implementing regional autonomy.

    Some minority nationality settlements that are connected or intertwined with Han nationality settlements, due to economic, political, and historical reasons, include some Han residents areas and towns when implementing regional autonomy, which is permissible, because these areas have formed a close and inseparable relationship with the minority nationality settlements in terms of economy. Including them in the relevant national autonomous region is not only of great benefit to the development of the nationality implementing regional autonomy, but also beneficial to the Han people in these areas. However, the issue of including Han areas is an issue involving both the people of minority nationalities and the relevant Han people. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct sufficient work with the minority nationalities and the relevant Han people in advance, and it is never possible to force or rush things. On the other hand, some minority nationality settlements cannot establish or are temporarily not suitable for establishing large autonomous regions due to limitations in geographical, economic, ethnic relations, and cadre conditions. Forcing the establishment of them may be detrimental to ethnic relations and national development. It is appropriate not to force the establishment or to postpone the establishment temporarily.

    The various higher-level people's governments must care about the sufferings of the people of minority nationalities in the autonomous regions, especially the sufferings of the people of minority nationalities who live in mountainous areas and other areas with poor natural and production conditions, because the people there have many difficult problems in production and life, and the higher-level people's governments urgently need to give them special care and make every effort to help them solve those urgent material life and production needs. The attitude of not caring about the sufferings of the people of minority nationalities, especially the sufferings of the people of minority nationalities in mountainous areas, is very wrong and must be changed. In addition, we should help minority nationalities develop their economy and culture and gradually improve their material and cultural living conditions in accordance with different situations and possible conditions. This aspect of work must be strengthened in the future. Among them, especially economic work, and especially agricultural and animal husbandry production, must be improved and developed as much as possible. As for carrying out certain key construction projects from the perspective of defending national defense and the development prospects of all nationalities, depending on the national financial situation, it is necessary to conduct thorough investigation and research to see whether there is a need and possibility in those places, and it should not be put forward as a general requirement. In developing the politics, economy, and culture of minority nationalities, the relevant higher-level people's governments have helped the autonomous regions with a lot of work, such as training cadres, developing agricultural and animal husbandry production, developing trade, and developing health care, and have thus been welcomed by the people of minority nationalities. However, some areas have not done enough and need to do a little more according to the possibilities. It is very wrong to not pay attention to the development of the politics, economy, and culture of minority nationalities and must be corrected. Of course, it is also wrong to make blind demands without regard to the actual situation and possible conditions and must also be corrected.

    The economic and cultural development of minority nationalities is inseparable from the political reform and social reform within the various minority nationalities. It is permissible and necessary for the autonomous organs of the various national autonomous regions to cautiously and steadily carry out certain political and social reforms that have matured in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people of their own nationalities and their leaders.

    The above is a summary of the basic experience in promoting national regional autonomy.

    Finally, we should declare that there are serious shortcomings and problems in the daily work of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, mainly due to insufficient understanding of the situation and the existence of bureaucracy. We are responsible for many of the mistakes that have occurred locally. We are examining our responsibilities and ask you to expose and criticize us more.

    中央民族事务委员会第三次（扩大）会议
    关于推行民族区域自治经验的基本总结
    （一九五三年六月十五日）
    一、推行民族区域自治的基本情况
    自中华人民共和国成立之日起，我国各民族人民进入了人民民主和民族平等的新的历史时期。我们的国家已成为各民族人民友爱合作的大家庭。各少数民族在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下，在汉族人民帮助下，实行了毛主席的民族区域自治政策，建立了或正在准备建立具备了条件的各种自治区和自治机关。民族区域自治政策的推行，使有一定聚居区的各少数民族在中央人民政府和有关上级人民政府的统一领导下，实现了他们在管理本民族事务上“当家作主”的权利，各自从他们的当前发展阶段逐步地进入新民主主义的总轨道，从而为他们的发展和进步开辟了广阔的道路。
    三年多来，中国共产党和中央人民政府以极大的重视和关怀推行着民族区域自治政策，一九五二年八月“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”的公布，是一个具有重大历史意义的措施，使我国推行民族区域自治的工作获得了指针。
    截止一九五三年三月，在全国范围内已建立起来的相当于县级及县级以上的民族自治区四十七个。其中，包括建立最早、规模最大的内蒙古自治区；规模较大的桂西僮族自治区、西康省藏族自治区、湘西苗族自治区、海南黎族、苗族自治区、西康省凉山彝族自治区、云南省西双版纳傣族自治区、吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区、青海省玉树藏族自治区、四川省藏族自治区、绥远省伊克昭盟蒙族自治区及乌兰察布盟蒙族自治区等。
    现在，全国各地建立民族自治区的工作，还在继续进行。今后还将有许多的新的民族自治区逐步建立起来，目前已建立了筹备机构的，计有新疆省的自治区、甘肃和宁夏的回族自治区、青海和甘肃的藏族自治区、宁夏和青海的蒙族自治区等。已经建立起来的民族自治区及其自治机关，则将得到进一步的充实和健全。
    三年多来，推行民族区域自治的工作，一般是健康的。全国各地的实践证明了并且还在证明着民族区域自治制度的优越性，它确是解决我国民族问题的钥匙。民族区域自治实行后，普遍而显著的效果是：
    （一）增强了各民族人民的爱国主义、积极性和自动精神。民族压迫制度的废除，民族平等政策的实行，特别是民族区域自治政策的推行，使少数民族人民中的爱国主义正在发展和发扬起来，这首先表现在他们积极参加镇反、剿匪，参加抗美援朝，参加保卫祖国边防等重大行动上。各少数民族人民对毛主席、中央人民政府怀抱着衷心的爱戴和拥护。他们说：“过去我们没有家，现在毛主席给我们安了家”，“过去我们打仗也争不来的东西，毛主席给我们了”。他们称颂毛主席是“冬天的太阳”，“夏天的雨”。各民族自治区的人民对于如何管理好和建设好自己的“家”，表现了很高的热情，他们的积极性和自动精神空前地提高了，因而自治区的各种工作，无论是抗美援朝、爱国增产、社会治安、训练干部等，都能比较顺利地开展起来，并且大都获得了良好的成绩。过去认为工作较难进行的某些民族聚居区，在实行了区域自治之后，各种工作也就好做得多了。
    （二）加强了民族间和各民族内部的团结。许多地区汉族的干部和群众对于少数民族建立民族自治区采取了热情支持和帮助的态度，这就使各自治区的少数民族人民日益增强了和汉族人民的友谊，认识了作为中国主体民族汉族的先进作用和领导作用。西康省藏族自治区的藏族人民把当地汉族干部和人民解放军称为“嘉色巴”（新汉人），许多少数民族人民把汉族称为“老大哥”，可以恰当地说明这种情况。实行区域自治的少数民族对于自治区内的其他少数民族，则多能仿照汉族干部和汉族群众对待他们的榜样，采取积极帮助、主动照顾的态度，从而加强了自治区内各民族间的团结。各民族内部的各地方、各部落、各教派也因自治区的建立和人民政府的教育，它们相互之间联系密切了，情感沟通了，原来“打冤家”的也多数取得和解，原来分割对立的也逐渐走向团结合作了，本来是团结的则更加亲密了。
    （三）密切了自治机关同人民之间的联系。各民族自治区建立后，大量的少数民族人民中的爱国主义知识分子、积极分子及与人民有联系的领袖人物，在自治机关中担任了工作，有许多并担任了领导工作，少数民族反映说：“反动派统治时代，人们骂我们猪毛赶不得毡，蛮子当不得官，现在毛主席来了，我们的人当了官了。”有民族文字的自治区，民族文字已逐渐成为自治机关行使职权的工具。自治机关的各种设施，一般都注意了运用民族形式，尊重民族的风俗习惯，这样就使当地的少数民族群众感觉到自治机关是自己所熟悉的和可亲近的，确是自己的政府，从而密切了自治机关同群众的联系。
    （四）逐渐促进了各少数民族政治、经济、文化的发展。各民族自治区建立后，由于上级人民政府的帮助，由于自治区内各民族人民的团结和觉悟提高，他们的政治、经济、文化生活一般都有了不同程度的进步和发展。若干建立较早的民族自治区，其发展和进步则较为显著。其中内蒙古自治区的成就，是值得特别指出的。过去的内蒙古，生产是十分落后的，现在则大大发展起来了。农业方面，一九五二年的粮食总产量比解放前的最高年产量超过百分之二十五，畜牧业生产较一九四七年自治区成立前，增加了一倍，自治区内并开始了若干现代工业的建设，由于生产的发展，现在人民的购买力比较一九四八年增加了三倍多，人民的生活得到显著的改善。过去识字的人很少，现在不仅培养了将近三万名各民族的干部，而且入学的儿童也达到了学龄儿童的百分之六十以上。过去疾病蔓延，人口急剧地下降，现在由于卫生医疗工作的开展，人口不仅停止了下降，而且开始增加了。上述的这许多成就，使内蒙古自治区达到了“人畜两旺”、欣欣向荣的境地，给其他的各民族自治区提供了一个向前发展的良好榜样。
    二、推行民族区域自治的基本经验
    三年多以来，各地在推行民族区域自治的工作中，积累了很多经验。最基本的有下列各点：
    （一）必须在一切工作中充分地估计各少数民族的特点和具体情况。各少数民族的情况是极端复杂的，不但在政治、经济、文化、宗教信仰、风俗习惯等方面，多与汉族不同，而且各少数民族之间也多互不相同，甚至在一个民族内部的各部落间，各教派间，农业区与畜牧区间，情况也多不相同或不完全相同。因此，对于各少数民族的工作，必须从各民族的具体情况出发，必须充分考虑到每一民族的政治、经济、文化和风俗习惯等一切具体特点，在实行区域自治政策时，还必须考虑每一聚居的民族所具备的具体条件。既不应把适用于汉族地区的一套作法和经验机械地搬用于各少数民族地区，也不应把某些少数民族和民族自治区中可行的办法和经验，机械地搬用于其他的少数民族和民族自治区。这在推行民族区域自治的工作和民族自治区建立后的各项工作中，都应予以特别注意。中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要第三十一条规定“上级人民政府应足够地估计各民族自治区当前发展阶段的特点和具体情况，使自己的指示、命令既符合于中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的总道路，又适合此种特点和具体情况”。各地经验证明，凡是依据上述规定的原则办事的，都获得了应有的成绩，并受到少数民族人民的拥护。例如西康省藏族自治区和青海省玉树藏族自治区的建立，由于掌握了这些地区政治、经济、文化和宗教的特点，号召一切爱国分子团结起来，实行区域自治，并采取了团结一切与人民有联系的领袖人物（包括宗教方面的领袖人物在内）的方针，就把各阶层人民广泛地团结在自治区人民政府的周围，很快地安定了社会秩序，圆满地完成了建立自治区的工作。
    相反的，由于对于少数民族社会的特点认识不足，错误地搬用汉族地区土地改革中的一套办法，在有的地区曾引起了少数民族人民的不满，甚至招致了一时的混乱。损害了推行民族区域自治的工作。
    依据目前情况看来，不顾各少数民族的特点和具体情况而机械地搬运汉族地区经验的作法，还不是个别地区的个别现象，而是在不少地区都相当普遍存在的现象，若干上级人民政府不顾自治区的不同情况，一般化地下命令、发指示，也使自治区的工作受到损失。这些情况，亟应引起各有关地区的注意，加以防止和纠正。
    另一方面，也要指出对于不顾当地具体情况和历史条件而机械地搬运先进民族和先进地区的经验的错误，我们固应坚决反对，但对于依据当地具体情况和历史条件而适当地运用先进民族和先进地区的经验，则没有理由加以反对。中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要第三十四条规定“上级人民政府应利用各种适当的方式，向各民族自治区人民介绍先进的政治、经济和文化建设的经验和情况”。经验证明，适当地学习先进经验，并依据当地具体情况和历史条件适当地运用先进经验，是各少数民族及各民族自治区顺利地进步和发展的必要条件。那种拒绝先进经验，故步自封的思想和作法，是有害于少数民族和民族自治区的进步和发展的，也必须适当地加以说服和纠正。
    （二）必须加强、巩固民族间和民族内部的团结。这是实行民族区域自治所必需具备的一个基本条件，又是实行民族区域自治所要达到的一个重要目的。
    三年多来，民族压迫制度的废除，民族平等政策的实现，已使我国各民族空前地团结起来了。有些地区，长期历史上所造成的民族间的隔阂已经基本消除。但有许多地区，这种隔阂仍然存在或尚未能达到基本消除。大汉族主义或大汉族主义残余的存在，是许多地区民族隔阂未能消除的主要原因。固然，少数民族中狭隘民族主义或狭隘民族主义残余的存在，是不可忽略的，而在某些地区内占有多数民族地位的某些少数民族中的大民族主义，也是不可忽略的，但就全国来说，大汉族主义却是目前民族关系上的主要危险。
    在一切民族中依据马克思、列宁主义的原则，加强爱国主义与国际主义的教育，加强民族政策的教育，进行自我批评，是克服大民族主义倾向和狭隘民族主义倾向的有效办法。目前特别需要在汉族干部及汉族人民中进行教育和引导他们进行自我批评，以克服大汉族主义或大汉族主义的残余。大汉族主义的实质即是资产阶级思想在民族关系上的表现，必须克服民族工作中资产阶级思想首先是克服大汉族主义，才能真正实现民族平等，并有效地帮助各少数民族克服各种各式的狭隘民族主义，西康省藏族自治区及其他若干民族地区内，由于汉族干部首先以自我批评的方式，深刻地检讨与批判了大汉族主义的思想和作风，因而少数民族干部受到感动，也自愿地进行批判其狭隘民族主义思想，并要求汉族干部帮助其进步，这样，就进一步地增进了民族间的信任，加强了民族间的团结，从而使自治区内的工作有了新的发展。这种经验值得各地仿行。
    民族间的隔阂，在建立自治区的过程中，往往突出地暴露出来。如在某些地区，一部分少数民族的人民以为实行区域自治就是和汉族分家，可以不要汉人了；那里的汉族人民也存在着“怕受气、怕变为少数民族”等顾虑，有的甚至准备搬家了；而当地其他的少数民族则顾虑着可能受到实行区域自治民族的歧视和不平等的待遇，也表现了疑虑不安。对于此类情况，各有关地区的领导机关和领导人员必须预加注意，在建立自治区的筹备阶段，即从搞好团结入手，充分尊重各民族的平等权利，以爱国主义和国际主义教育人民，主动地消除各有关民族人民中对实行区域自治所存在的各种误解和顾虑；对于有关建立自治区的各项重要问题应与各少数民族及汉族人民中的代表人物进行充分协商，取得他们的同意，再去进行。这样作，建立自治区的过程就成了加强和巩固民族团结的过程。经验证明，各自治区在其筹备建立的阶段，即这样做了的，都加强了民族间的友好合作，使建立自治区的工作能够圆满地完成，并为以后进一步地加强民族团结打下基础；凡是没有这样做的，自治区的圆满建立就都受到了一定的影响。经验也证明，实行区域自治的民族容易忽视当地其他民族的利益，因此，实行区域自治的民族必须时刻警惕这方面的缺点，经常注意尊重和照顾当地其他少数民族和汉族人民的利益；对于聚居境内的其他少数民族，则应尽可能地帮助他们早些建立起自己的自治区。只有这样，才能取得自治区内其他各民族的信任，才能加强和巩固民族间的团结，才有利于自治区建设事业的发展。任何歧视别的民族，不尊重别的民族利益的思想和作法，都是错误的，必须注意防止和克服。
    在推行民族区域自治的工作中，还必须尽力加强和巩固民族内部的团结。这也是要在自治区建立之前大力进行民族内部各部落、各地区、各教派之间的团结工作，向他们进行团结教育，调解好他们
    当前的纠纷和争端，尽力地消除他们之间的隔阂。
    在有关建立自治区的一切重大问题上，必须照顾上
    述各方面的利益。号召他们在上级人民政府领导下，互相尊重，互相协商，很好地团结起来。
    几年以来，各地在调解民族内部纠纷，搞好民族内部团结方面，做了许多工作，取得了很大的成绩，使过去各少数民族内部长期历史上所形成的不团结甚至对立的情况，逐渐好转了。但加强民族内部各地区、部落、教派间的团结，仍是推行区域自治和解决民族问题方面的一项重要的任务，各地须依据不同情况，继续努力进行。
    经验证明：为了做好民族间的团结及民族内部各部落、各地区、各教派间的团结，都需要注意做好各少数民族与人民有联系的各方面领袖人物的工作。他们在本民族中有一定的影响和威望，做好了他们的工作，就大大便利于做好人民群众的工作。因此，对于有关实行区域自治的各项重要问题，都必须和他们进行充分协商，并取得他们的同意。在筹备机构中，自治机关中，及其他方面的工作中，使他们都有适当的工作岗位，尽量做到各得其所，帮助他们把工作做好，并帮助他们进步。各少数民族的领袖人物亦应当尊重人民的志愿，尊重上级人民政府的领导，并积极取得汉族干部的帮助，努力地向前进步。
    帝国主义从其侵略野心出发，千方百计地破坏我国各民族的团结，若干地区所业已揭露的帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石残余匪特在少数民族中煽动暴乱的事实，充分证明了敌人的这种阴谋罪行。经验证明，凡是少数民族地区的暴乱，几乎没有一件不是与敌特、反革命的挑拨有关的，几乎没有一件不是因为有关少数民族的个别上层人物—首先上了当而使敌人的阴谋得逞的。对于此种情况，必须引起各少数民族人民及其领袖人物的高度警惕，必须采取揭露敌人、惩办反革命、加强人民中爱国主义教育的方法，来对付敌人的这种破坏。
    （三）必须逐步使自治机关民族化，这是加强和巩固民族团结，密切自治机关与各族人民联系的重要环节。
    自治机关的民族化，依照中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要有关各条的规定，包括：使自治机关以实行区域自治的民族人员为主要成份组成之，并包括自治区内适当数量的其他少数民族和汉族的人员；自治机关的具体形式，依照实行区域自治的民族大多数人民及与人民有联系的领袖人物的志愿；使自治机关采取一种在其自治区内通用的民族文字，为行使职权的主要工具，并对不适用此种文字的民族行使职权时，同时采用该民族的文字；使自治机关在其工作中注意运用民族形式。
    总起来说，自治机关的民族化包括民族干部、民族语言文字及民族形式三个主要问题。这是需要较长时期的努力才能完全解决的问题。
    关于培养民族干部：各自治区建立后，民族干部的培养和成长是比较快的。现在各自治区都已有一定数量的民族干部，他们参加了自治机关的各项工作，一部分已担任了领导职务。他们大都与当地人民有密切联系，熟悉当地情况，并在实际工作的锻炼中，使自己的政治、文化水平和工作能力得到了一定的提高。这些成绩是与上级人民政府的关怀
    和汉族干部的帮助分不开的。但是自治区内民族干
    部的培养，还远赶不上自治区建设事业的需要。各有关的上级人民政府必须加强指导和帮助自治区培养干部的工作，继续从少数民族人民中的爱国知识分子、群众积极分子及与人民有联系的领袖人物
    中，培养和提拔出适合各种需要的干部与人材。为
    此，需要检查总结经验，并依据各地具体情况克服
    培养民族干部工作方面所存在的缺点。
    各自治区的建立和自治区内各项建设事业的发
    展，有赖于汉族干部和少数民族干部的团结和合
    作。参加各自治区工作的汉族干部，大都满怀热情
    地为少数民族服务，在帮助自治区培养各种民族干部上起了重要作用，获得少数民族干部的爱护，这是值得称赞的。但仍有一部分汉族干部存在着不尊重民族干部职权和包办代替的不良作风，必须克服和纠正，以利民族干部的培养和生长。
    关于民族语文和民族形式：各上级人民政府必须帮助自治机关采取一种在其自治区内通用的民族文字为行使职权的主要工具，并对不适用此种文字行使职权时，同时采用该民族的文字。对于那些确有成为民族特征的语言但没有文字的各民族，应如何帮助其创造文字，是一个既迫切而又复杂的问题，需要经过周密的调查研究，分别订出可行的计划，逐步地进行，使能取得交际工具，发展民族文化。目前对自愿学习汉文或其他进步民族文字的，应当积极加以帮助，但不得有任何强迫。个别已经通用汉语，汉语实际上已成为其民族通行语言的民族，则应积极帮助其学习汉文。少数民族中有许多优良的文化艺术传统，应该予以适当的发扬，并帮助它们逐渐吸收新的内容。在这方面，我们的工作还作得很少，需要提起注意。对于少数民族的风俗习惯，应该予以应有的尊重，在其他方面，如自治区内行政单位的名称等，也应注意民族形式的运用。在尊重民族语文与运用民族形式方面，许多自治区都做了许多工作，并获得良好的成绩。除内蒙古自治区和延边朝鲜族自治区外，如西康省藏族自治区人民政府去年订出了发展民族语文的实施办法，各行政机关及财经机关，都充实了藏文翻译干部，自治区的汉族干部都学习藏文藏语，各种文告，宣传品都以藏、汉两种文字印行，今年二月开始，一切公文也都使用了藏、汉两种文字，使藏文成为自治区人民政府行使职权的主要工具。在这些自治区之内，民族干部也正在热心学习汉族语文，这是应该欢迎的。但是也有些地方领导机关，对于民族语文和民族形式的使用是不重视或不够重视的，个别民族地区的某些干部甚至硬要少数民族说汉话穿汉装，硬要以汉族地区的秧歌舞去代替少数民族的舞蹈，这都是极端错误的。民族形式问题是有关民族权利、民族发展的重大问题。我们的许多工作，要通过适当的民族形式，才能深入到少数民族群众中去。各民族对其风俗习惯和各种民族形式，有保持或改革的自由，但必须依据各民族大多数人民及其与人民有联系的领袖人物的自愿，别人不得加以强迫，任何强迫都是错误的和不许可的。但尊重民族形式，不等于要保持某些足以阻碍民族前进和发展并为广大人民及其领袖已经意识到应该加以改革的形式，这也是应当加以注意的。
    （四）必须帮助自治区逐步地行使其自治权利，各民族自治区在国家的统一制度和计划下，都享有与其行政地位相适应的关于政治、经济、财政、文化、教育及人民地方武装等项自治权利。这些自治权利的正确行使，能够发挥处于不同发展阶段的少数民族在处理内部事务上极大的自动性，因而也就极大地有利于自治区内少数民族政治、经济、文化的发展。自治区的各项自治权利，即是少数民族自治机关管理本民族内部事务的“当家作主”的权利。因此是一个极其重要的问题。此项权利的正确行使，不仅需要有关各上级人民政府给予应有的尊重，尤需要有关上级人民政府给予必要的指示和帮助。现在看来，大多数有关的上级人民政府对这方面业已作了许多的努力，但也有若干有关的上级人民政府，对于各自治区自治权利的尊重是不够的，有个别上级人民政府甚至在实际上还没有把它领导下的相当于专区级的民族自治机关，当作一级地方政权，不是经过自治机关而是直接地向自治机关领导下的下级政权下达命令、布置工作。这种作法是错误的，它损害了自治区的工作引起了自治区内人民的不满，他们说“建政建政（即建立自治区），原封不动。”对于上述的错误作法，各有关的上级人民政府须加以检查和纠正。
    对于自治区自治权利的行使，我们还缺乏经验，对现有的经验也还缺乏搜集和研究的工作，因此各种具体的行使办法，还待作进一步的研究。这方面的工作，我们现已着手进行，还望大家提出意见，以便及早地制定出一个办法来。
    （五）必须在可能条件下尽力发展政治、经济、文化事业。这是解决民族问题的基本环节之一。区域自治的实行，还不等于民族问题的根本解决，要根本解决民族问题，必须依据可能条件，积极帮助少数民族人民发展他们的政治、经济和文化，使能逐步达到先进民族的水平。因此，自治区在其建立之初及建立以后，都必须重视发展政治、经济和文化的问题。在自治区的筹备建立阶段，当处理自治区的民族构成和区域界限时，就需要特别考虑到自治区内各民族，特别是实行区域自治的民族的发展条件。
    有些与汉族聚居区相联接或相交错的少数民族聚居区，因为经济、政治和历史的原因，在实行区域自治时，包括了一部分汉族居民区和城镇，这是允许的，因为这些地区在经济上已与少数民族聚居区形成了密切不可分离的关系，其划入有关的民族自治区，不仅是对实行区域自治的民族的发展有很大好处，对于这些地区的汉族人民也是有利的。但划入汉族地区问题，是一个涉及少数民族人民和有关汉族人民双方的问题，因而就必须在事先向少数民族和有关的汉族人民进行充分的工作，绝不可勉强和草率从事。另一方面，某些少数民族聚居区，因受地理、经济、民族关系和干部等条件的限制，不能建立或暂时不宜建立大的自治区，勉强建立了反而对民族关系和民族发展不利时，则以不勉强建立或暂时不建立为适当。
    各上级人民政府必须关怀自治区少数民族人民的疾苦，特别是那些居住在山区及其他自然条件和生产条件很差的地区的少数民族人民的疾苦，因为那里的人民在生产和生活方面的困难问题很多，亟需上级人民政府予以特别关怀，尽力帮助他们解决那些迫切的物质生活和生产的需要。那种不关怀少数民族人民的疾苦，特别是山区少数民族人民疾苦的态度，是非常不对的，必须加以改变。此外，应依据不同情况和可能条件，帮助少数民族发展其经济和文化，逐步地改善其物质、文化生活状况，这方面的工作今后必须加强。其中特别是经济工作，目前特别是农牧业生产必须尽可能设法帮助其改进和发展。至于从保卫国防和各民族的发展前途着眼，依据国家财政情况，有重点地进行某些基本建设，则须进行周密的调查研究，看那些地方有无必要和可能，而不可作为一般的要求提出。在发展少数民族的政治、经济和文化方面，各有关上级人民政府多已帮助自治区做了不少的工作，如培养干部、发展农、牧业生产、发展贸易、发展卫生医疗等，因而受到少数民族人民的欢迎，但也有些地区还做得不够，还需要依据可能多做一点。不重视少数民族政治、经济、文化的发展是很不对的，必须注意改正，当然那种不顾实际情况与可能条件的盲目要求也不对，也必须注意改正。
    少数民族的经济和文化的发展，是与各少数民族内部的政治改革和社会改革分不开的，各民族自治区的自治机关依据本民族大多数人民及其领袖人物的志愿，慎重稳步地进行某些条件已经成熟的政治改革和社会改革，是应当许可的和必要的。
    以上是推行民族区域自治基本经验的总结。
    最后，我们应该声明：中央民族事务委员会的
    日常工作中存在着严重的缺点和毛病，主要是对情况了解不够，存在着官僚主义，地方上发生的错误，有许多是我们有责任的。我们正在检查自己的责任，请求大家多加揭发和批评。
