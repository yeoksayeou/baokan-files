    Central Nationalities Affairs Commission's Third (Enlarged) Meeting
    Basic Summary of Experiences in Promoting National Regional Autonomy
    (June 15, 1953)

    I. Basic Situation of Promoting National Regional Autonomy

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people of all nationalities in our country have entered a new historical period of people's democracy and national equality. Our country has become a big family of friendly cooperation among the people of all nationalities. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and with the help of the Han people, all minority nationalities have implemented Chairman Mao's policy of national regional autonomy, and have established or are preparing to establish various autonomous regions and autonomous organs that meet the necessary conditions. The implementation of the policy of national regional autonomy has enabled minority nationalities with certain areas of concentrated residence to realize their right to "be masters of their own affairs" in managing their own national affairs under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government and relevant higher-level people's governments, and to gradually enter the general orbit of new democracy from their current stage of development, thereby opening up broad avenues for their development and progress.

    Over the past three years, the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government have attached great importance to and have shown great concern for the promotion of the policy of national regional autonomy. The promulgation of the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" in August 1952 was a measure of great historical significance, providing a guideline for our country's work in promoting national regional autonomy.

    As of March 1953, forty-seven national autonomous regions at or above the county level had been established nationwide. These include the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which was established earliest and is the largest in scale; the relatively large Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region, Xikang Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, Yunnan Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, Jilin Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, Qinghai Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region, Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region, Suiyuan Ikezhao League Mongolian Autonomous Region, and Ulanqab League Mongolian Autonomous Region.

    Currently, the work of establishing national autonomous regions is still underway throughout the country. Many new national autonomous regions will be gradually established in the future. Preparatory institutions have already been established in Xinjiang Province, the Hui autonomous regions in Gansu and Ningxia, the Tibetan autonomous regions in Qinghai and Gansu, and the Mongolian autonomous regions in Ningxia and Qinghai. The national autonomous regions and their autonomous organs that have already been established will be further enriched and improved.

    Over the past three years, the work of promoting national regional autonomy has generally been healthy. Practice throughout the country has proven and continues to prove the superiority of the national regional autonomy system. It is indeed the key to solving our country's national question. The general and significant effects after the implementation of national regional autonomy are:

    (1) Enhanced patriotism, initiative, and spontaneity of the people of all nationalities. The abolition of the system of national oppression, the implementation of the policy of national equality, and especially the promotion of the policy of national regional autonomy, have enabled patriotism to develop and flourish among the minority nationalities. This is primarily manifested in their active participation in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and bandits, participating in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and participating in defending the motherland's borders. The people of all minority nationalities harbor heartfelt love and support for Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. They say, "In the past, we had no home. Now Chairman Mao has given us a home," "In the past, we couldn't win what we fought for. Chairman Mao gave it to us." They praise Chairman Mao as "the sun in winter" and "the rain in summer." The people of all national autonomous regions have shown great enthusiasm for how to manage and build their own "home," and their initiative and spontaneity have been unprecedentedly enhanced. Therefore, various tasks in the autonomous regions, whether it is resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production through patriotism, social security, or training cadres, can be carried out relatively smoothly and have generally achieved good results. Certain ethnic-minority-populated areas where work was previously considered difficult have become much easier to work in after the implementation of regional autonomy.

    (2) Strengthened unity between nationalities and within each nationality. In many areas, Han cadres and the masses have adopted an enthusiastic attitude of supporting and helping minority nationalities establish national autonomous regions, which has made the minority nationalities in each autonomous region increasingly enhance their friendship with the Han people and recognize the advanced and leading role of the Han people as the main nationality of China. The Tibetan people of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region call the local Han cadres and the People's Liberation Army "Gyas√©ba" (new Han people), and many minority nationalities appropriately refer to the Han people as "elder brother," which adequately illustrates this situation. The minority nationalities implementing regional autonomy are generally able to follow the example of the Han cadres and Han people in treating them, adopting a positive attitude of helping and actively caring for other minority nationalities within the autonomous region, thereby strengthening unity among the various nationalities within the autonomous region. The various localities, tribes, and religious sects within each nationality have also become more closely linked, their emotions have been communicated, most of those who "fought against each other" have achieved reconciliation, those who were originally divided and opposed are gradually moving towards unity and cooperation, and those who were originally united have become even closer due to the establishment of the autonomous region and the education of the people's government.

    (3) Close ties between autonomous organs and the people. After the establishment of the various national autonomous regions, a large number of patriotic intellectuals, activists, and leaders with ties to the people from minority nationalities have taken up work in the autonomous organs, and many have assumed leadership positions. Minority nationalities have said, "In the era of reactionary rule, people cursed us that pig bristles could not be made into felt, and savages could not be officials. Now Chairman Mao has come, and our people have become officials." In autonomous regions with national written languages, national written languages have gradually become tools for the autonomous organs to exercise their functions. The various facilities of the autonomous organs generally pay attention to the use of national forms and respect for national customs and habits, so that the local minority nationalities feel that the autonomous organs are familiar and approachable, and are indeed their own government, thereby closely linking the autonomous organs with the masses.

    (4) Gradual promotion of the political, economic, and cultural development of the various minority nationalities. After the establishment of the various national autonomous regions, due to the help of the higher-level people's governments, the unity of the people of all nationalities in the autonomous regions, and the improvement of their awareness, their political, economic, and cultural lives have generally made progress and development to varying degrees. Some of the national autonomous regions that were established earlier have seen more significant development and progress. Among them, the achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are particularly noteworthy. In the past, production in Inner Mongolia was very backward, but now it has greatly developed. In agriculture, the total grain output in 1952 exceeded the highest annual output before liberation by more than 25 percent. Livestock production has doubled compared to before the establishment of the autonomous region in 1947. Several modern industries have also begun construction within the autonomous region. Due to the development of production, the people's purchasing power is now more than three times higher than in 1948, and the people's lives have been significantly improved. In the past, very few people were literate. Now, not only have nearly 30,000 cadres of all nationalities been trained, but the number of children enrolled in school has also reached more than 60 percent of school-age children. In the past, diseases were rampant and the population was declining rapidly. Now, due to the development of health and medical work, the population has not only stopped declining but has also begun to increase. The above-mentioned achievements have made the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region reach a state of "thriving people and livestock" and prosperity, providing a good example of forward development for other national autonomous regions.

    II. Basic Experience in Promoting National Regional Autonomy

    Over the past three years, many experiences have been accumulated in the work of promoting national regional autonomy in various places. The most basic points are as follows:

    (1) It is essential to fully estimate the characteristics and specific circumstances of the various minority nationalities in all work. The situation of each minority nationality is extremely complex. Not only are they different from the Han people in terms of politics, economy, culture, religious beliefs, and customs, but the various minority nationalities are also different from each other. Even within a nationality, the situations in various tribes, religious sects, and agricultural and pastoral areas are often different or not completely the same. Therefore, for the work of each minority nationality, it is essential to start from the specific circumstances of each nationality, and it is essential to fully consider all the specific characteristics of each nationality, such as politics, economy, culture, and customs. When implementing the policy of regional autonomy, it is also essential to consider the specific conditions possessed by each concentrated nationality. Neither should the set of practices and experiences applicable to the Han areas be mechanically applied to the various minority nationalities areas, nor should the feasible methods and experiences of certain minority nationalities and national autonomous regions be mechanically applied to other minority nationalities and national autonomous regions. This should be given special attention in the work of promoting national regional autonomy and in the various tasks after the establishment of the national autonomous region. Article 31 of the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" stipulates that "The higher-level people's government shall sufficiently estimate the characteristics and specific circumstances of the current stage of development of each national autonomous region, so that its instructions and orders conform to the general path of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and are suitable for such characteristics and specific circumstances." Experience in various places has proven that those who act in accordance with the above-mentioned principles have achieved due success and have been supported by the minority nationalities. For example, the establishment of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region and the Qinghai Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region grasped the characteristics of these regions in terms of politics, economy, culture, and religion, called on all patriots to unite, implemented regional autonomy, and adopted the policy of uniting all leaders with ties to the people (including religious leaders), which broadly united the people of all strata around the autonomous region people's government, quickly stabilized social order, and successfully completed the work of establishing the autonomous region.

    Conversely, due to insufficient understanding of the characteristics of minority nationality societies and the erroneous mechanical application of the methods of land reform in the Han areas, discontent among the minority nationalities and even temporary chaos were caused in some areas, damaging the work of promoting national regional autonomy.

    Based on the current situation, the practice of mechanically transporting the experiences of the Han areas without regard to the characteristics and specific circumstances of the various minority nationalities is not an isolated phenomenon in individual areas, but a fairly common phenomenon in many areas. Some higher-level people's governments issue orders and instructions in a generalized manner without regard to the different situations of the autonomous regions, which also causes losses to the work of the autonomous regions. These situations should urgently attract the attention of the relevant areas to prevent and correct them.

    On the other hand, it should also be pointed out that while we should resolutely oppose the error of mechanically transporting the experiences of advanced nationalities and advanced areas without regard to the specific circumstances and historical conditions of the locality, there is no reason to oppose the appropriate application of the experiences of advanced nationalities and advanced areas in accordance with the specific circumstances and historical conditions of the locality. Article 34 of the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" stipulates that "The higher-level people's government shall use various appropriate methods to introduce the experiences and situations of advanced political, economic, and cultural construction to the people of all national autonomous regions." Experience has proven that appropriately learning from advanced experience and appropriately applying advanced experience in accordance with the specific circumstances and historical conditions of the locality is a necessary condition for the smooth progress and development of the various minority nationalities and the various national autonomous regions. The idea and practice of rejecting advanced experience and sticking to old ways are harmful to the progress and development of minority nationalities and national autonomous regions, and must also be appropriately persuaded and corrected.

    (2) It is essential to strengthen and consolidate unity between nationalities and within nationalities. This is a basic condition that must be possessed for the implementation of national regional autonomy, and it is also an important goal to be achieved by the implementation of national regional autonomy.

    Over the past three years, the abolition of the system of national oppression and the realization of the policy of national equality have united all nationalities in our country as never before. In some areas, the ethnic estrangement caused by the long history has been basically eliminated. However, in many areas, this estrangement still exists or has not yet been basically eliminated. The existence of Han chauvinism or the remnants of Han chauvinism is the main reason why ethnic estrangement has not been eliminated in many areas. Of course, the existence of narrow nationalism or the remnants of narrow nationalism among minority nationalities cannot be ignored, and great-nationality chauvinism among some minority nationalities that occupy the position of the majority nationality in certain areas cannot be ignored either, but on a national scale, Han chauvinism is the main danger in national relations at present.

    Strengthening education in patriotism and internationalism and strengthening education in national policies among all nationalities in accordance with the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and conducting self-criticism, are effective ways to overcome the tendency of great-nationality chauvinism and the tendency of narrow nationalism. At present, it is particularly necessary to educate and guide Han cadres and Han people to conduct self-criticism in order to overcome Han chauvinism or the remnants of Han chauvinism. The essence of Han chauvinism is the manifestation of bourgeois ideology in national relations. To overcome bourgeois ideology in national work, it is necessary to first overcome Han chauvinism in order to truly realize national equality and effectively help the various minority nationalities overcome all kinds of narrow nationalism. In the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region and other ethnic minority areas, because Han cadres first deeply reviewed and criticized the ideas and practices of Han chauvinism in the form of self-criticism, the minority nationality cadres were moved, and they also voluntarily criticized their narrow nationalist ideas and asked Han cadres to help them make progress. In this way, mutual trust between nationalities was further enhanced, and unity between nationalities was strengthened, thereby bringing new development to the work in the autonomous region. This experience is worth emulating in various places.

    Ethnic estrangement often prominently emerges in the process of establishing an autonomous region. For example, in some areas, some minority nationalities believe that the implementation of regional autonomy is to separate from the Han people and that they can do without the Han people. The Han people there also have concerns such as "fear of being bullied and fear of becoming a minority nationality," and some are even preparing to move. The other minority nationalities in the area are concerned that they may be discriminated against and treated unfairly by the nationalities implementing regional autonomy, and they also expressed doubts and anxieties. For this type of situation, the leading organs and leaders of the relevant areas must pay attention to it in advance, and in the preparatory stage of establishing the autonomous region, start with doing a good job in unity, fully respect the equal rights of all nationalities, educate the people with patriotism and internationalism, and actively eliminate the various misunderstandings and concerns existing among the people of the relevant nationalities regarding the implementation of regional autonomy. All important issues related to the establishment of the autonomous region should be fully consulted with the representatives of the various minority nationalities and the Han people, and their consent should be obtained before proceeding. By doing this, the process of establishing the autonomous region becomes a process of strengthening and consolidating national unity. Experience has proven that those autonomous regions that did so in the preparatory stage of their establishment strengthened friendly cooperation between nationalities, so that the work of establishing the autonomous region could be successfully completed, and laid the foundation for further strengthening national unity in the future; all those who did not do so were somewhat affected by the smooth establishment of the autonomous region. Experience has also proven that nationalities implementing regional autonomy are prone to neglecting the interests of other nationalities in the area. Therefore, nationalities implementing regional autonomy must always be vigilant about this shortcoming and often pay attention to respecting and taking care of the interests of other minority nationalities and Han people in the area. The other minority nationalities residing within the jurisdiction should be helped to establish their own autonomous regions as early as possible. Only in this way can we gain the trust of other nationalities in the autonomous region, strengthen and consolidate unity between nationalities, and promote the development of the construction cause of the autonomous region. Any ideas and practices that discriminate against other nationalities or do not respect the interests of other nationalities are wrong and must be prevented and overcome.

    In the work of promoting national regional autonomy, it is also necessary to make every effort to strengthen and consolidate unity within nationalities. This also requires vigorously carrying out unity work among the various tribes, regions, and religious sects within a nationality before the establishment of the autonomous region, conducting unity education for them, mediating their current disputes and conflicts, and making every effort to eliminate estrangement between them.

    On all major issues related to the establishment of the autonomous region, the interests of the above-mentioned aspects must be taken into account. It is necessary to call on them to respect each other, consult with each other, and unite well under the leadership of the higher-level people's government.

    In recent years, various places have done a lot of work in mediating internal disputes and promoting internal unity among nationalities, and have achieved great results, so that the long-term disunity and even antagonism formed within various minority nationalities in the past has gradually improved. However, strengthening unity between various regions, tribes, and religious sects within nationalities is still an important task in promoting regional autonomy and solving the national question, and various places must continue to work hard in accordance with different situations.

    Experience has proven that in order to do a good job in the unity between nationalities and the unity between the various tribes, regions, and religious sects within nationalities, it is necessary to pay attention to doing a good job in the work of the various leaders of the various minority nationalities who have ties with the people. They have a certain influence and prestige in their own nationalities. Doing a good job in their work greatly facilitates doing a good job in the work of the people. Therefore, all important issues related to the implementation of regional autonomy must be fully consulted with them and their consent obtained. In the preparatory institutions, autonomous organs, and other aspects of work, they should all have appropriate jobs, try to make each person use their talents and help them do their jobs well, and help them make progress. The leaders of the various minority nationalities should also respect the wishes of the people, respect the leadership of the higher-level people's government, and actively seek the help of Han cadres and strive to make progress.

    Driven by their aggressive ambitions, imperialists have tried every means to undermine the unity of the various nationalities in our country. The facts of the riots instigated by the remnants of the imperialists and their running dogs, Chiang Kai-shek, among the minority nationalities in some areas that have been exposed fully prove the enemy's conspiracy and crimes. Experience has proven that almost none of the riots in minority nationality areas are unrelated to the provocations of enemy agents and counter-revolutionaries, and almost none of them have succeeded because individual upper-level figures of the relevant minority nationalities were first deceived, allowing the enemy's conspiracy to succeed. This situation must arouse the high vigilance of the people of all minority nationalities and their leaders, and methods must be adopted to expose the enemy, punish counter-revolutionaries, and strengthen patriotic education among the people to deal with the enemy's sabotage.

    (3) It is essential to gradually nationalize the autonomous organs. This is an important link in strengthening and consolidating national unity and closely linking the autonomous organs with the people of all nationalities.

    According to the relevant articles of the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China," the nationalization of autonomous organs includes: making the personnel of the nationalities implementing regional autonomy the main component of the autonomous organs, and including an appropriate number of personnel from other minority nationalities and Han nationalities in the autonomous region; making the specific form of the autonomous organs conform to the wishes of the majority of the people of the nationalities implementing regional autonomy and the leaders who have ties with the people; making the autonomous organs adopt a national written language that is commonly used in their autonomous region as the main tool for exercising their functions, and simultaneously adopting the written language of the nationalities that do not use this written language when exercising their functions; making the autonomous organs pay attention to the use of national forms in their work.

    In general, the nationalization of autonomous organs includes three main issues: national cadres, national languages and written languages, and national forms. This is an issue that requires a long period of effort to completely resolve.

    Regarding the training of national cadres: After the establishment of the various autonomous regions, the training and growth of national cadres is relatively rapid. Now, each autonomous region already has a certain number of national cadres who have participated in the various tasks of the autonomous organs, and some have assumed leadership positions. Most of them have close ties with the local people, are familiar with the local situation, and have improved their political, cultural level, and working ability to a certain extent in the exercise of practical work. These achievements are inseparable from the care of the higher-level people's governments and the help of Han cadres. However, the training of national cadres within the autonomous regions is far from keeping up with the needs of the construction cause of the autonomous regions. The relevant higher-level people's governments must strengthen guidance and help the autonomous regions in the work of training cadres, and continue to train and promote cadres and talents suitable for various needs from among the patriotic intellectuals, mass activists, and leaders with ties to the people of minority nationalities. For this reason, it is necessary to examine and summarize experience, and overcome the shortcomings that exist in the work of training national cadres in accordance with the specific circumstances of each place.

    The establishment of the various autonomous regions and the development of the various construction causes within the autonomous regions depend on the unity and cooperation of Han cadres and minority nationality cadres. The Han cadres who participate in the work of the various autonomous regions mostly serve the minority nationalities with enthusiasm, and have played an important role in helping the autonomous regions train various national cadres, and have won the love of the minority nationality cadres, which is commendable. However, there are still some Han cadres who have bad habits such as not respecting the powers of national cadres and doing everything for them, which must be overcome and corrected in order to facilitate the training and growth of national cadres.

    Regarding national languages and written languages and national forms: The various higher-level people's governments must help the autonomous organs adopt a national written language that is commonly used in their autonomous region as the main tool for exercising their functions, and simultaneously adopt the written language of the nationalities that do not use this written language when exercising their functions. How to help those nationalities that do have a language that has become a national characteristic but do not have a written language to create a written language is both urgent and complex. It requires thorough investigation and research, separate formulation of feasible plans, and gradual implementation to obtain communication tools and develop national culture. At present, those who voluntarily learn Chinese or the written languages of other progressive nationalities should be actively helped, but there must be no coercion. Those nationalities that already use Chinese and Chinese has actually become their national common language should be actively helped to learn Chinese. Many minority nationalities have excellent cultural and artistic traditions, which should be appropriately promoted and helped to gradually absorb new content. In this regard, we have done very little work and need to pay attention to it. Due respect should be given to the customs and habits of minority nationalities, and attention should also be paid to the use of national forms in other aspects, such as the names of administrative units in the autonomous regions. Many autonomous regions have done a lot of work in respecting national languages and written languages and using national forms, and have achieved good results. In addition to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, the People's Government of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region formulated implementation measures for the development of national languages and written languages last year, and all administrative and financial organs have strengthened Tibetan translation cadres. The Han cadres in the autonomous region are learning Tibetan and Tibetan language, and all documents and propaganda materials are printed in both Tibetan and Chinese. Since February this year, all official documents have also used both Tibetan and Chinese, making Tibetan the main tool for the People's Government of the autonomous region to exercise its functions. Within these autonomous regions, national cadres are also enthusiastically learning Chinese, which should be welcomed. However, the leading organs in some places do not pay attention to or do not pay enough attention to the use of national languages and written languages and national forms. Some cadres in individual ethnic minority areas even insist that minority nationalities speak Chinese and wear Chinese clothes, and insist on replacing the dances of minority nationalities with Han-style Yangko dances, which are all extremely wrong. The issue of national forms is a major issue related to national rights and national development. Many of our tasks can only penetrate into the minority nationality masses through appropriate national forms. Each nationality has the freedom to maintain or reform its customs and habits and various national forms, but it must be based on the voluntary will of the majority of the people of each nationality and the leaders who have ties with the people, and no one may coerce them. Any coercion is wrong and impermissible. However, respecting national forms does not mean maintaining certain forms that are sufficient to hinder national progress and development and that the vast majority of the people and their leaders have already realized should be reformed, which should also be paid attention to.

    (4) It is essential to help the autonomous regions gradually exercise their autonomous rights. Under the unified system and plan of the state, all national autonomous regions enjoy autonomous rights commensurate with their administrative status in terms of politics, economy, finance, culture, education, and local people's armed forces. The correct exercise of these autonomous rights can give play to the great spontaneity of minority nationalities in different stages of development in handling internal affairs, and thus greatly benefit the political, economic, and cultural development of minority nationalities in the autonomous regions. The various autonomous rights of the autonomous regions are the rights of the minority nationality autonomous organs to manage the internal affairs of their own nationalities and to "be masters of their own affairs." Therefore, it is an extremely important issue. The correct exercise of this right not only requires the relevant higher-level people's governments to give due respect, but also requires the relevant higher-level people's governments to give necessary instructions and assistance. It now appears that most of the relevant higher-level people's governments have already made many efforts in this regard, but some relevant higher-level people's governments do not respect the autonomous rights of the various autonomous regions enough. Some individual higher-level people's governments do not even treat the national autonomous organs under their leadership, which are equivalent to special district-level organs, as a local government at the same level, and issue orders and arrange work directly to the lower-level governments under the leadership of the autonomous organs instead of through the autonomous organs. This practice is wrong. It harms the work of the autonomous regions and causes dissatisfaction among the people in the autonomous regions. They say, "Establish a government, establish a government (that is, establish an autonomous region), but everything remains the same." The relevant higher-level people's governments must examine and correct the above-mentioned wrong practices.

    We lack experience in the exercise of the autonomous rights of the autonomous regions, and we also lack the work of collecting and researching the existing experience. Therefore, various specific implementation methods still need to be further researched. We have now started this work, and we also hope that everyone will put forward opinions so that we can formulate a method as soon as possible.

    (5) It is essential to make every effort to develop political, economic, and cultural undertakings under possible conditions. This is one of the basic links in solving the national question. The implementation of regional autonomy is not equivalent to the fundamental solution of the national question. To fundamentally solve the national question, it is necessary to actively help the people of minority nationalities develop their politics, economy, and culture in accordance with possible conditions so that they can gradually reach the level of advanced nationalities. Therefore, the autonomous regions must attach importance to the development of politics, economy, and culture at the beginning of their establishment and after their establishment. In the preparatory stage of establishing the autonomous region, when dealing with the ethnic composition and regional boundaries of the autonomous region, it is necessary to give special consideration to the development conditions of the various nationalities in the autonomous region, especially the nationalities implementing regional autonomy.

    Some minority nationality settlements that are connected or intertwined with Han nationality settlements, due to economic, political, and historical reasons, include some Han residents areas and towns when implementing regional autonomy, which is permissible, because these areas have formed a close and inseparable relationship with the minority nationality settlements in terms of economy. Including them in the relevant national autonomous region is not only of great benefit to the development of the nationality implementing regional autonomy, but also beneficial to the Han people in these areas. However, the issue of including Han areas is an issue involving both the people of minority nationalities and the relevant Han people. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct sufficient work with the minority nationalities and the relevant Han people in advance, and it is never possible to force or rush things. On the other hand, some minority nationality settlements cannot establish or are temporarily not suitable for establishing large autonomous regions due to limitations in geographical, economic, ethnic relations, and cadre conditions. Forcing the establishment of them may be detrimental to ethnic relations and national development. It is appropriate not to force the establishment or to postpone the establishment temporarily.

    The various higher-level people's governments must care about the sufferings of the people of minority nationalities in the autonomous regions, especially the sufferings of the people of minority nationalities who live in mountainous areas and other areas with poor natural and production conditions, because the people there have many difficult problems in production and life, and the higher-level people's governments urgently need to give them special care and make every effort to help them solve those urgent material life and production needs. The attitude of not caring about the sufferings of the people of minority nationalities, especially the sufferings of the people of minority nationalities in mountainous areas, is very wrong and must be changed. In addition, we should help minority nationalities develop their economy and culture and gradually improve their material and cultural living conditions in accordance with different situations and possible conditions. This aspect of work must be strengthened in the future. Among them, especially economic work, and especially agricultural and animal husbandry production, must be improved and developed as much as possible. As for carrying out certain key construction projects from the perspective of defending national defense and the development prospects of all nationalities, depending on the national financial situation, it is necessary to conduct thorough investigation and research to see whether there is a need and possibility in those places, and it should not be put forward as a general requirement. In developing the politics, economy, and culture of minority nationalities, the relevant higher-level people's governments have helped the autonomous regions with a lot of work, such as training cadres, developing agricultural and animal husbandry production, developing trade, and developing health care, and have thus been welcomed by the people of minority nationalities. However, some areas have not done enough and need to do a little more according to the possibilities. It is very wrong to not pay attention to the development of the politics, economy, and culture of minority nationalities and must be corrected. Of course, it is also wrong to make blind demands without regard to the actual situation and possible conditions and must also be corrected.

    The economic and cultural development of minority nationalities is inseparable from the political reform and social reform within the various minority nationalities. It is permissible and necessary for the autonomous organs of the various national autonomous regions to cautiously and steadily carry out certain political and social reforms that have matured in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people of their own nationalities and their leaders.

    The above is a summary of the basic experience in promoting national regional autonomy.

    Finally, we should declare that there are serious shortcomings and problems in the daily work of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, mainly due to insufficient understanding of the situation and the existence of bureaucracy. We are responsible for many of the mistakes that have occurred locally. We are examining our responsibilities and ask you to expose and criticize us more.
