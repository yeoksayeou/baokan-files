Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 11th: Major General Ungerovszky, the Polish member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), wrote a letter to General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, on the 11th, strongly protesting the violation by the United States Armed Forces of the rights guaranteed to the NNSC's neutral inspection teams by the Armistice Agreement, the abduction of Mr. Hadukiewicz, the Polish interpreter of the Jiangling NNSC inspection team on the 9th, and most resolutely demanded the return of Mr. Hadukiewicz to the Jiangling NNSC inspection team. General Ungerovszky's protest letter was delivered to the US side on the morning of the 11th. The full text of the protest letter is as follows: To General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command:

　　On the morning of September 9, 1953, at 5:15 AM, Mr. Hadukiewicz, a Polish staff member who served as an interpreter for the Jiangling NNSC inspection team, was abducted. This abduction occurred under the following circumstances:

　　At the aforementioned time, Mr. Hadukiewicz and Major Goronga, another Polish staff member of the inspection team, were preparing to fly to Panmunjom at the invitation of the NNSC and were waiting at the airport for the plane to take them to Panmunjom. Shortly before the plane took off, Major Goronga noticed a jeep parked nearby. He saw Mr. Hadukiewicz, a military policeman, and an American captain sitting in the vehicle. When Major Goronga, in surprise, approached the jeep to find out what was happening, the military policeman started the car and quickly drove it away. Another jeep carrying the luggage of both Mr. Hadukiewicz and Major Goronga also followed. About ten minutes later, both jeeps returned to the airport, one of which contained Major Goronga's luggage. Mr. Hadukiewicz did not reappear. Lieutenant Colonel Prigus, a member of the NNSC inspection team who was also at the airport at the time, asked the liaison officer: "What happened to Mr. Hadukiewicz?" The liaison officer replied that he did not know. The protests lodged and the demands for the return of Mr. Hadukiewicz made by Lieutenant Colonel Prigus to the local American military authorities yielded no results.

　　We know that Mr. Hadukiewicz was isolated by the US authorities for many hours within the Jiangling military camp on September 9. The fact that Mr. Hadukiewicz was forcibly isolated has been confirmed by a public statement issued to the press by the United Nations Command.

　　The above facts clearly demonstrate that we are faced with an incident in which the Jiangling United States Armed Forces abducted a member of the NNSC inspection team. This incident was meticulously planned in advance.

　　I lodge a stern protest against this unprecedented violation of the rights guaranteed to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission neutral inspection team by the Armistice Agreement, and most resolutely demand that Mr. Hadukiewicz, a member of the Jiangling NNSC inspection team, be returned to that inspection team.

    中立国监察委员会波兰委员写信给克拉克
    抗议美方劫持中立国视察小组波兰译员
   【新华社开城十一日电】中立国监察委员会波兰委员翁格洛夫斯基少将在十一日写信给联合国军总司令克拉克上将，严厉地抗议美国武装部队侵犯停战协定所保证给予中立国监察委员会中立国视察小组的权利，在九日劫持江陵中立国视察小组波兰译员哈都克耶维赤，并最断然地要求将哈都克耶维赤送回江陵中立国视察小组。翁格洛夫斯基将军的抗议信已在十一日上午送交美方，抗议信全文如下：联合国军总司令克拉克上将：
    一九五三年九月九日晨五时十五分，在江陵中立国视察小组担任译员的波兰人员哈都克耶维赤被劫持。此一劫持事件是在下述情况下发生的：
    在上述时间，哈都克耶维赤与视察小组另一波兰人员哥龙加少校应中立国监察委员会的邀请准备飞往板门店，正在机场等候送他们到板门店的飞机。飞机起飞前不久，哥龙加少校注意到有一辆吉普车停在附近。他看到哈都克耶维赤和一名宪兵及一名美国上尉坐在车上。当哥龙加少校在惊讶之下走向吉普车，想弄清楚发生了什么事的时候，宪兵开动了汽车，很快地把车开走。另一辆载着哈都克耶维赤和哥龙加少校两人的行李的吉普车也随之而去。约十分钟以后，两辆吉普车都开回机场，其中一辆中装有哥龙加少校的行李。哈都克耶维赤即未再出现。当时也在机场的中立国视察小组组员普里古斯中校向联络官说：“哈都克耶维赤出了什么事？”联络官回答说他不知道。普里古斯中校向当地美国军事当局所提出的抗议和送回哈都克耶维赤的要求，都没有结果。
    我们知道，哈都克耶维赤九月九日在江陵军营营地内曾被美方当局隔离了许多个钟头。哈都克耶维赤被强迫隔离的事实已由联合国军对新闻界所发表的公报所证实。
    上述事实清楚地说明：我们所面对的事件，乃是江陵美国武装部队劫持中立国视察小组人员的事件。这一事件是在事先周密布置好了的。
    对于这一前所未闻的侵犯停战协定所保证给予中立国监察委员会中立国视察小组的权利的事件，我提出严厉的抗议，并最断然地要求将江陵中立国视察小组人员哈都克耶维赤送回该视察小组。
                中立国监察委员会委员
                      翁格洛夫斯基少将
                    一九五三年九月十一日
