    [This News] The All-China Federation of Cooperatives recently issued urgent instructions regarding expanding operations, increasing income, practicing strict economy, and tightening expenditures in order to mobilize the national cooperative system to increase production and practice thrift.
    The instructions, after analyzing the business situation of cooperatives nationwide in the first half of this year and the main problems existing, pointed out: In order to implement increased production and thrift, achieve the goal of increasing national fiscal revenue, reduce and eliminate losses in cooperatives, and strive to increase reasonable accumulation, cooperatives in all regions must take the following measures:
    Regarding expanding operations and increasing income: 1. Expand supply operations and actively organize sources of goods. Cooperatives in all regions should vigorously purchase goods from local industry and handicrafts, closely integrate this with the marketing of native and special products, and widely promote local material exchange. They should also expand the supply of state industrial products and strive to overfulfill the annual supply plan. To ensure that primary-level cooperatives can fully supply goods, higher-level cooperatives must not restrict primary-level cooperatives from purchasing goods from industrial production cooperatives and state-owned companies. Provincial federations should help county cooperatives conduct in-depth investigations into the needs of cooperative members, and, based on the specific circumstances of prosperous areas, disaster areas, economic crop areas, and the working foundation of primary-level cooperatives, put forward different requirements, and must strive to overfulfill the annual plan. In disaster areas, in particular, it is necessary to cooperate with disaster victims in production for self-salvation, promptly supply the production materials and necessities of life they need, and actively market their handicrafts and native products. However, handicrafts and native products that truly have no market should not be blindly supported, so as not to hinder supply and marketing operations and instead not benefit disaster victims. 2. Under the leadership and assistance of local Party committees and governments, complete the state's assigned purchasing tasks; in particular, grain purchasing plans should be strived for completion and overfulfillment. In purchasing work, policies should be thoroughly publicized, state price policies should be implemented, and, combined with the production and livelihood needs of farmers in autumn and winter, the full supply of materials should be vigorously organized, assisting the state in timely withdrawing currency put into circulation and stabilizing the market. Local native, special, and by-products should also be actively organized for marketing, according to the requirements of cooperative members, with responsibilities assigned at each level, and the self-operated plan should be completed and overfulfilled. 3. Accelerate capital turnover, reduce circulation costs, and increase reasonable accumulation. Cooperatives at all levels should, with the 1953 planned targets as the base (primary-level cooperatives that have prepared plans and implemented the five fixed rates should use the planned targets for the fourth quarter of this year as the base; primary-level cooperatives that have not prepared plans or implemented the five fixed rates should, in principle, use the actual completed figures for the fourth quarter of last year as the base), formulate practical and feasible increased production and thrift targets and control figures. Loan quotas for federations at all levels should be appropriately delegated, striving to gradually reduce arrears, rationally use funds, and give play to the potential of funds. At the same time, the links in commodity circulation should be reduced, preventing roundabout transportation and transportation accidents. In terms of prices, the principle that wholesale prices must not be higher than the local company's preferential wholesale prices, and that retail prices must not be higher than market prices, should continue to be implemented, preventing lower-level cooperatives from suffering losses due to unreasonable price difference distribution. 4. Industrial production cooperatives should strive to overfulfill the production tasks approved by the State Planning Commission this year. It is necessary to organize cadres of production departments of federations at all levels to learn the skills of organizing and managing production, conduct in-depth inspections and assistance in primary-level cooperatives; to further strengthen democratic management, mobilize and organize cooperative members to tap potential, find tricks, promote advanced experience, increase output and variety; and should pay special attention to improving quality, reducing costs, reducing waste of raw materials, strengthening the combination of production and sales, and expanding product sales channels. Processing enterprises should strive to overfulfill the annual production tasks, and pay special attention to the supply of raw materials.
    Regarding practicing strict economy and tightening expenditures: 1. Give full play to the role of bank loans, accelerate turnover under the conditions of reasonable storage and guaranteed supply, in order to save state funds and reduce interest burden. 2. Plan and properly streamline institutions and personnel, and appropriate adjustments should be made especially for administrative personnel whose proportion is too large. Higher-level cooperatives should assist lower-level cooperatives in studying streamlining methods, and, under the leadership of local Party committees and governments, properly resettle the personnel who must be streamlined. 3. Save administrative management expenses. In addition to saving wages due to personnel reductions, attention should also be paid to saving all unnecessary expenses in the expense budget; in particular, eliminate corruption and waste, strengthen warehouse management, and pay attention to fire and theft prevention. 4. In terms of capital construction and cadre training, it is necessary to resolutely cut back those appropriations for undertakings that can be reduced, postponed, or are dispensable, so as to fully use the funds in business, expand commodity supply and native product marketing. 5. Cooperatives at all levels should mobilize all staff to pay attention to saving grain, and formulate specific saving measures.
    The instructions finally put forward measures to ensure the realization of the above measures. Among them, it is stipulated that cooperatives in all regions should, based on the experience of carrying out the increased production and thrift movement last year, formulate specific fighting goals and specific measures for increasing production and thrift in the fourth quarter of this year according to the different conditions of cooperatives in various regions, vigorously mobilize implementation, launch competitions, and implement a reward system.

    全国合作总社发出紧急指示
    动员合作社系统进行增产节约
    【本报讯】中华全国合作社联合总社为动员全国合作社系统进行增产节约，最近发出关于扩大业务、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支的紧急指示。
    指示在分析了今年上半年全国合作社的业务情况和存在的主要问题后指出：为了贯彻增产节约，达到增加国家财政收入，减少和消除合作社亏损现象并争取增加合理积累的目的，各地合作社必须采取以下措施：
    在扩大业务、增加收入方面：一、扩大供应业务，积极组织货源。各地合作社应大力向地方工业和手工业进货，密切与土产、副产品的推销相结合，广泛促进地方物资交流，并应扩大国家工业品的供应，争取超额完成全年供应计划。为保证基层社能充分供应货物，上级社不得限制基层社向工业生产合作社和国营公司进货。省联社应帮助县社深入调查社员群众的需要，根据丰收区、受灾区、经济作物区和基层社工作基础不同的具体情况，提出不同的要求，务须争取超额完成全年计划。在受灾区，尤须配合灾民生产自救，及时供应其所需生产资料和生活资料，积极推销其手工业品和土产品。但确无销路的手工业品和土产品，不应盲目扶持，以免妨碍供销业务，反而无利于灾民。二、在当地党委、政府领导协助下，完成国家交给的代购任务；特别是粮食代购计划，更应努力争取完成并超额完成。在收购工作中，应深入宣传政策，贯彻国家价格政策，结合秋冬农民生产和生活需要，大力组织物资的充分供应，协助国家及时回笼投放的货币，稳定市场。对当地土产、副产和特产品，也应根据社员群众要求，逐级分工负责地积极组织推销，完成并超额完成自营计划。三、加速资金周转，降低流转费用，增加合理积累。各级社应以一九五三年计划指标为基数，根据具体情况（已编制计划实行五项定率的基层社以今年第四季度计划指标为基数；未编制计划、未实行五项定率的基层社，原则上以去年第四季度实际完成数为基数），订出切实可行的增产节约指标和控制数字。各级联社贷款额度应适当下放，争取逐步减少拖欠，合理使用资金，发挥资金的潜在力。同时应减少商品流转环节，防止迂回运输和运输事故。在价格方面，应继续贯彻批发价不得高于当地公司的批发优待价，以及零售价不得高于市价的原则，防止因差价分配不合理而造成下级社亏损的现象。四、工业生产合作社今年应争取超额完成国家计划委员会批准的生产任务。必须组织各级联社生产部门的干部学会组织和管理生产的技能，深入基层社进行具体检查和帮助；要进一步加强民主管理，发动和组织社员挖掘潜力，寻找窍门，推广先进经验，增加产量和品种；并应特别注意提高质量，降低成本，减少原材料的浪费，加强产销的结合，扩大产品销路。加工企业应争取超额完成全年生产任务，特别要注意原材料的供应工作。
    在厉行节约、紧缩开支方面：一、充分发挥银行贷款作用，在合理贮备、保证供应的条件下加速周转，以节约国家资金，减少利息负担。二、有计划地妥善地精简机构和人员，特别是行政人员比重过大的应作适当调整。上级社应协助下级社研究精简办法，并在当地党委、政府领导下对于必须精简的人员妥为安置。三、节约行政管理费。除因人员减少节约工资外，并应注意节约在费用开支中的一切不必要的开支；特别是要消灭贪污浪费现象，加强仓库保管，注意防火防盗。四、在基本建设及干部训练等方面，都要坚决削减那些可以削减的、可以推迟的或可办可不办的事业拨款，以便将资金充分运用到业务方面，扩大商品供应和土产推销。五、各级合作社应动员全体工作人员注意节约粮食，并订出具体节约办法。
    指示最后提出了保证实现以上措施的办法。其中规定各地合作社应根据去年开展增产节约运动的经验，分别各地区合作社不同的情况，订出今年第四季度增产节约的具体奋斗目标和具体办法，大力动员贯彻，展开竞赛，并实行奖励制度。
