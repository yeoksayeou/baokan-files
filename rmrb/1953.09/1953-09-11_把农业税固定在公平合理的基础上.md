In its instruction on agricultural tax work for 1953, the State Council of the Central People's Government, in addition to stipulating that "the agricultural tax collection targets should remain stable at the 1952 actual collection level for the next three years," also emphasized a most important principle: agricultural tax work must adapt to the specific circumstances of the rural economy in various parts of the country, and every effort should be made to ensure fairness and reasonableness in all aspects. This is also an important measure to allow farmers to recuperate, increase their enthusiasm for production, and ensure increased grain production.

Over the past few years, our agricultural tax work has been improved year by year and has gradually become more reasonable. In order to make the burden fair for each region and each farmer, rural work cadres and financial and grain workers have also made many efforts. However, because some leading organs and workers underestimated the extremely uneven development of my country's rural economy and did not clearly understand the characteristics of my country's small-scale peasant economy, they often used an estimated average number to guide work in different regions; as a result, sometimes it seems that the public grain is distributed fairly, but it is not actually reasonable. Therefore, in the past few years, on the one hand, the total amount of agricultural tax reductions and exemptions nationwide has been very large (in 1952, the total amount of actual reductions and exemptions in various regions was equal to 13 percent of the amount that should have been collected), and the total amount of actual tax collection in 1952 was also reduced compared to 1951; but on the other hand, there are still phenomena of excessive lightness or heaviness in some areas, so some farmers still feel that the burden is too heavy. This has damaged the enthusiasm of some farmers for production. Therefore, in the future, not only should we stabilize the burden on farmers in the next few years, but we must also pay attention to fixing it on a fair and reasonable basis.

To make the agricultural tax burden fair and reasonable, we must first make the calculation of the normal annual yield of land bearing agricultural tax generally true and balanced. In the past few years, the financial departments have attempted to achieve this goal by means of "land survey and yield determination"; however, the practice of "land survey and yield determination" was wrong, as it was divorced from reality and the masses, and therefore the acreage and yield determined were not completely suitable for the specific conditions of the local area, and the phenomenon of being too high or too low continued to exist. Originally, during the land reform, the masses had calculated and evaluated the acreage and yield of the land, and many regions had made continuous adjustments to the acreage and yield in the grain collection work over the years, but in the land survey and yield determination, these foundations were completely overturned, and the survey and determination were carried out in isolation and subjectively using their own set of methods. Naturally, this approach will not do a good job. Some places have repeatedly surveyed and determined, not only making the masses feel overwhelmed, but also making the masses feel that "yields are evaluated every year and yields are evaluated every season", causing many concerns and preventing them from letting go and cultivating the land well. Therefore, the State Council's instruction stipulates that: "In areas where land survey and yield determination has not been completed or is not being carried out, land survey and yield determination work should generally be stopped, and the public grain collection standard can be adjusted and stipulated based on the land acreage and yield data evaluated by the masses during the land reform and the preliminary survey of field yield data in grain collection work over the years, with reference to the local production situation of the year, and through democratic discussion by the masses." As for areas where land survey and yield determination has been carried out, "if the past yield determination is too light or too heavy, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, adjustments should be made. If it is too low, it can be raised, and if it is too high, it must be lowered, but all should be carried out in a step-by-step manner and not be rushed." This is entirely in line with the interests of the country and the demands of the masses.

In order to implement a fair, reasonable, and encouraging production increase burden policy, doing a good job in legally reducing and exempting taxes is also an important key. Legal reduction and exemption is a very important component of our current agricultural tax policy. Our country has a vast territory, and the natural conditions in various places are extremely inconsistent. The climate changes greatly, and the level of science and technology is still very low, lacking sufficient ability to overcome natural disasters. At the same time, our rural areas have just been liberated from the exploitation and oppression of reactionary forces for not long, and many areas have made significant sacrifices in the revolutionary war, and many farmers still have great difficulties in production and life. Under these circumstances, it is very necessary to reduce or exempt the agricultural tax that some regions and some farmers in difficulty should pay, in accordance with unified principles, based on the situation of natural disasters and other social reasons. How well the reduction and exemption policy is implemented is closely related to whether the burden on farmers is fair and whether the relationship between the Party and the government and the broad masses of farmers can be maintained normally. In agricultural tax work, after appropriately adjusting the yield to make it generally balanced, the most important thing is to do a good job in legally reducing and exempting taxes. In the past, many regions had shortcomings in implementing the reduction and exemption policy. For example, last year, the agricultural tax in northern Jiangsu was reduced four times, and the amount of reduction and exemption reached 26 percent of the amount that should have been collected, but the masses were still dissatisfied. The reason was that they did not grasp the situation in advance and actively do a good job in reduction and exemption; they were forced to use an egalitarian method to reduce and exempt taxes temporarily, so that those who should not have been reduced were reduced, and those who should have been reduced more were not reduced more. This is a major lesson. The State Council's instruction says: "Implementing the reduction and exemption policy has a great impact on caring for the suffering of farmers and improving the relationship between the government and farmers. We must absorb past experiences and lessons, and correct the two deviations of not reducing when it should be reduced, not exempting when it should be exempted, or reducing when it should not be reduced and exempting when it should not be exempted." The instruction also defines the principles of "disaster reduction and exemption" and the scope of "social reduction and exemption", and explains the methods for determining reduction and exemption households. All regions must earnestly follow the instructions of the State Council and avoid the mistakes that occurred in the past. This year, many regions have suffered various degrees of disasters in both summer and autumn crops; the leading organs in all disaster-stricken areas should pay special attention to this issue.

To achieve fairness and reasonableness in the collection of agricultural tax, it is also necessary to adapt to local conditions. Because our country has a vast territory and has three different climates of frigid, temperate, and subtropical zones, the soil quality and farming conditions in various places are different, and the proportion of agricultural production investment also varies greatly, the specific circumstances of rural economic development are extremely inconsistent. For example, in the poor mountainous areas of western Hubei and western Hunan, the average annual agricultural income per person is equivalent to 300 to 500 catties of rice, and some farmers' average annual agricultural income per person is even less than 200 catties; while in the Chengdu Plain and around Taihu Lake, the average annual agricultural income per person can reach 1,000 catties of rice or even more. Taking the Northeast administrative region as an example, the differences between regions are also very large: the average annual agricultural income per person in the northern region is equivalent to more than 1,600 catties of sorghum, while the southern region is only equivalent to more than 800 catties, and Rehe is only equivalent to about 500 catties. Even within a county, there are often great differences in the economic situation between villages and farmers. Therefore, although different tax rates and reduction and exemption methods have been stipulated for different regions in the past, they still cannot completely adapt to various specific circumstances. In the future, different collection methods and reduction and exemption methods should be adopted for areas that have just undergone land reform and areas where land reform has been implemented for a long time, for poor and backward mountainous areas and rich plains, for areas with high and low agricultural production investment costs, for agricultural areas and pastoral areas, for ethnic minority areas and general areas, for areas that have not been affected by disasters and areas that have been affected by disasters, for areas with minor disasters and areas with severe disasters, for industrial raw material producing areas and grain producing areas, and for various other different areas. In order to implement the policy of adapting to local conditions, it is necessary to give local Party committees and local governments a certain degree of flexibility under the unified central policy. That is to say, centralized unity is very necessary, but being too "rigidly" unified is also harmful. In the State Council's instructions, local governments are given a certain degree of flexibility in terms of tax rates, reduction and exemption methods, and the proportion of grain, industrial raw materials, and cash in the total collection. This is necessary and correct. Local people's governments should, on the premise of ensuring national income and taking care of the interests of farmers, combine with the local specific circumstances and formulate appropriate methods so that the collection of agricultural tax can achieve the greatest possible fairness and reasonableness under the conditions of implementing a proportional tax system.

To do the above work well, we must thoroughly rely on the masses, conduct in-depth investigation and research, and adopt different working methods and steps according to the different actual conditions in various places. Chairman Mao once said when discussing agricultural tax work in 1942: "If the investigation work is done well, it will be easy to implement the regulations." ("Economic Problems and Financial Problems") He talked about many examples to show that if the investigation work is not done well, agricultural tax work cannot be done correctly; if a more in-depth investigation work is carried out, the burden can be made fair and reasonable. The State Council's recent instruction also pointed out that the method of correctly implementing the reduction and exemption policy is "in-depth investigation, mass discussion, and government verification." The method of doing investigation work is what Chairman Mao instructed us in the "Preface to Rural Investigation": first, look downward and rely on the masses, and second, hold investigation meetings. Under normal circumstances, it is sufficient to select typical small-scale investigation meetings, and it should be closely combined with production. Never repeat the mistakes made in land survey and yield determination in some places in the past, and adopt a large-scale, universal, and concentrated land measurement method. Experience has proved that it is a waste of manpower and money and the effect is not great.

As long as we earnestly implement the instructions of the State Council, adopt correct working methods and improve our work style, we will definitely be able to correct the mistakes and shortcomings in agricultural tax work in the past, make agricultural tax work more fair and reasonable, and fix it on a fair and reasonable basis.

### 把农业税固定在公平合理的基础上

    把农业税固定在公平合理的基础上
    中央人民政府政务院关于一九五三年农业税工作的指示中，除了规定“今后三年内，农业税的征收指标，应稳定在一九五二年实际征收的水平上”以外，还贯串着一个最重要的原则，就是农业税工作必须适应全国各地农村经济的具体情况，从各方面尽可能做到公平合理。这也是使农民得以休养生息，增加生产积极性、保证粮食增产的一项重要措施。
    过去几年来，我们的农业税工作是逐年改进、逐步趋向合理的。为了使各地区各农户的负担公平，农村工作干部和财粮工作人员也曾作了不少努力。但是，由于某些领导机关和工作人员对于我国农村经济发展极度不平衡的情况估计不足，对于我国小农经济的特点认识不清，往往根据一个估计的平均数字去指导不同地区的工作；结果，有时表面看起来好像把公粮分配得还算公平，实际上却并不合理。因此，几年来，一方面全国农业税减免总额很大（一九五二年各地实际减免总额等于应征数额的百分之十三），实际征税总额一九五二年比一九五一年也减少了一些；但在另一方面，在某些地区仍存在畸轻畸重现象，因此仍有些农民感到负担太重。这样，就损害了某些农民的生产积极性。因此，今后不但要在几年内使农民的负担固定起来，而且必须注意使它固定在公平合理的基础上。
    要使农业税负担公平合理，首先要使负担农业税的土地常年应产量的计算大体真实和平衡。过去几年中，财政部门曾经企图用“查田定产”的办法达到这个目的；但是，“查田定产”的做法是有错误的，它脱离实际又脱离群众，因而查定的亩数和产量不完全适合当地的具体情况，并继续存在着偏高偏低的现象。本来，在土地改革中群众对于土地的亩数、产量是有过计算和评定的，许多地区历年征粮工作中对于地亩、产量也作过不断调整，但在查田定产中，完全推翻了这些基础，孤立地、主观主义地用自己的一套办法去进行查定。这种作法，自然是不会把工作作好的。有些地方反复查定，不但使群众感到不胜其烦，而且使群众感到“年年评产，季季评产”，发生了许多顾虑，不敢放手把地种好。因此，政务院的指示中规定：“在未完成或未进行查田定产地区一般应停止进行查田定产工作，公粮征收标准可根据各地土地改革时群众评定的和历年征粮工作中初步调查的田亩产量材料，参照当地当年生产丰歉情况，并通过群众民主评议，加以调整和规定。”至于已进行过查田定产的地区，
  “过去定产有畸轻畸重以致引起群众不满者，需加调整，过低的可以提高，过高的必须降低，但均须有步骤地进行，不可操之过急”。这是完全符合国家的利益和群众的要求的。
    为了贯彻公平合理及鼓励增产的负担政策，做好依法减免工作也是一个重要的关键。依法减免是当前我们的农业税政策中极重要的一个组成部分。我国地区广大，各地自然条件极不一致，气候变化相差很大，科学技术水平又还很低，缺乏足够的战胜自然灾害的能力。同时，我国农村是刚从反动势力剥削压榨下解放出来没有多久的，许多地区在革命战争中还作出了重大的牺牲，许多农民在生产上和生活上都还有很大的困难。在这种情况下，按照统一的原则，根据自然灾害的情况及其它社会原因，减免某些地区和一部分有困难的农民应交的农业税是很必要的。减免政策执行得好坏，和农民负担是否公平、党和政府与广大农民群众的关系能否保持正常都有密切的关系。在农业税工作中，适当地调整了产量使之大体平衡之后，最要紧的就是把依法减免的工作做好。过去许多地区在执行减免政策中是有缺点的。如去年苏北的农业税连减了四次，减免额达到了应征额的百分之二十六，群众仍然不满。原因是没有事先掌握情况，主动地做好减免工作；临时被迫用平均主义的办法进行减免，使不该减的也减了，该多减的未能多减。这是一个重大的教训。政务院的指示中说：“贯彻减免政策，对照顾农民疾苦、改善政府与农民的关系影响极大，必须吸收过去的经验教训，纠正该减不减、该免不免，或不该减也减、不该免也免两种偏向。”指示中并且确定了“灾情减免”的原则和“社会减免”的范围，交代了确定减免户的方法。各地必须认真按照政务院的指示去做，避免过去发生过的错误。今年又有许多地区夏秋两季作物遭受了各种不同程度的灾害；一切遭受灾害的地区的领导机关对于这个问题应当特别加以注意。
    要做到征收农业税的公平合理，还必须因地制宜。由于我们国家幅员辽阔，兼有寒带、温带、亚热带三种不同气候，各地土质与耕作条件不同，农业生产投资的比重也有大有小，因此农村经济发展的具体情况是极不一致的。如湖北西部、湖南西部等地贫瘠的山区，每人每年平均农业收入合三百到五百斤稻谷，有些农户每人平均农业收入甚至在二百斤以下；而成都平原、太湖周围等地，每人每年平均农业收入可达一千斤稻谷甚至还要多些。就拿东北一个行政区来说，各地差别也很大：北部地区每人每年平均农业收入合一千六百多斤高粱，南部地区只合八百多斤，热河只合五百斤左右。就是在
  一个县境内，各乡村、各农户之间的经济情况也往往有很大差别。因此，过去虽然也规定了不同地区的不同的税率和减免办法，但是仍然不能完全适合各种不同的具体情况。今后对于刚经过土地改革的地区和实行土地改革已久的地区，对于贫瘠落后的山区和富庶的平原地区，对于农业生产投资成本高和成本低的地区，对于农业地区和牧业地区，对于少数民族地区和一般地区，对于未受灾的地区和受灾地区，对于轻灾地区和重灾地区，对于工业原料产区和粮食产区，以及其他各种不同地区，都应当采取不同的征收办法和减免办法。为了贯彻因地制宜的政策，就必须在中央统一方针下，给各地地方党委和地方政府以一定的机动权力。这就是说，集中统一是十分必要的，但“统”得太“死”了也是有害的。政务院的指示中，对于税率，减免办法，征收总额中粮食、工业原料和代金的比例，都给了地方政府以一定的机动权。这是必要的、正确的。各地人民政府应当在保证国家收入而又照顾农民利益的原则下，结合当地具体情况，订出适当办法，使农业税的征收，在实行比例税制的条件下，做到最大限度的公平合理。
    要做好以上各项工作，必须深入依靠群众，深入调查研究，根据各地不同的实际情况，采取不同的工作方法和步骤。毛主席在一九四二年论及农业税工作的时候就曾说过：“调查工作做得好，执行条例便容易。”（“经济问题与财政问题”）他谈了许多实例，说明调查工作做得不好，就不能正确地做好农业税工作；进行了比较深入的调查工作，便能使负担公平合理。政务院最近的指示中也指出正确执行减免政策的方法是“深入调查，群众评议，政府核定”。做调查工作的方法，也就是毛主席在“农村调查序言”中指示我们的：第一是眼睛向下，依靠群众，第二是开调查会。在一般情况下，选择典型开小型调查会即可，而且要紧密结合生产来进行，决不可重犯过去某些地方查田定产中所犯的错误，采用大规模的、普遍的、突击的丈田方式。经验证明，那是劳民伤财而且效果不大的。
    只要认真执行政务院的指示，采取了正确的工作方法并改进了作风，我们就一定能够纠正过去农业税工作中的错误和缺点，使农业税工作进一步做到公平合理，并把它固定在公平合理的基础上。
