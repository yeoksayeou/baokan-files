    "Harvesting and Seed Selection Side-by-Side, Sunning and Storage Simultaneously"
    The people of Minzhu Village in Bazhong County, Sichuan Province, an old revolutionary base area, are experiencing a bumper harvest of rice this year. The village's 145 households cultivated 723 mu of rice, yielding an average of 454 jin per mu, an increase of 56 jin per mu compared to last year. During the harvest season, the golden rice paddies competed with each other, and the snow-white cotton was dazzling. The farmers were overjoyed. Before the autumn harvest, the village had just completed its elections. The newly elected, most trusted cadres were in high spirits. They extensively organized propagandists to promote "harvesting and seed selection side-by-side, sunning and storage simultaneously, threshing while plowing," and worked with Party members and Youth League members to help the masses with the harvest, ensuring a fast harvest with minimal waste.

    Overcoming Wind, Sand, and Drought to Achieve a Bumper Harvest
    Farmers in Changling County, Jilin Province, in the western part of the province, are joyfully welcoming an unprecedented agricultural bumper harvest and livestock increase this year. Changling County borders Inner Mongolia to the west and Heilongjiang to the north. Its territory is a vast plain, with seventy-two tuozis (mobile sand dunes) undulating on the plain. Every spring and autumn, dry wind and sand blow from the Inner Mongolian plains, making it impossible to see people across the way. Wind, sand, drought, and wild animals are Changling's biggest disasters. However, the liberated people of Changling are devising all kinds of methods to transform the natural environment, continuously increasing agricultural yields and livestock breeding, and improving people's lives year by year. This year, Changling County promoted the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, changed the past extensive, low-yield, and crude cultivation methods, implemented equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and topdressing, and overcame drought and animal plagues during the spring and summer. The entire county presents an unprecedented bumper harvest scene. According to preliminary county-wide surveys of soybeans, corn, and millet, there are no less than one hundred fields with yields of 10,000 jin or more per hectare. About 14,000 hectares have doubled the planned yield of last year, about 30,000 hectares have increased by 50% based on this year's planned yield, and about 50,000 hectares have increased by 30%. Even the eighth and ninth districts, which have suffered severe droughts for many years, are expected to have a good harvest this year.
    This year, the people of Changling County corrected the "emphasis on agriculture and neglect of animal husbandry" ideology, greatly increasing the livestock breeding rate. The minimum pregnancy rate of mares in the county can reach 60%. If livestock are protected from abortion in the future, there is great hope for increased livestock production. (Li Zhengde)
    Harvest Each Ripe Patch
    Zhangjiakou Special District, Hebei Province, has experienced drought this year, and crops have matured twenty days earlier than last year. Wanquan, Chongli, Longguan, Chicheng, Yanqing, Weixian, Xuanhua, Zhuolu and other counties have begun harvesting early-maturing crops; autumn harvest is tense in Zhangbei, Shangyi, Guyuan, Kangbao, and Shangdu counties, and more than half has already been cut down. All localities have learned from past lessons and are paying attention to disaster prevention, harvesting each ripe patch. People in disaster-stricken areas such as Kangbao, Shangdu, and Guyuan are also actively rushing to harvest the remaining autumn crops, putting forward the slogan of "harvesting every stalk, never losing a grain of food." The current urgent need in this area is to turn over and dry the crops cut down before the rain and the harvested grain to prevent mold. According to a check in Kangbao County, many of the cut naked oats have already sprouted. (Li Wanjun)
    Gaodaichang Mutual Aid Team Prepares Well for the Autumn Harvest
    The Gaodaichang Mutual Aid Team in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, has actively carried out autumn harvest preparations based on the characteristic of this year's autumn harvest being relatively labor-intensive. Before the autumn harvest, they held a team members' meeting and decided to repair and organize large carts and small farm tools, expand the site, and repair roads before the autumn harvest. The meeting also required each household to check the materials used for the autumn harvest. After the meeting, they reorganized the labor force and divided the whole team into two harvesting teams, each team actively preparing according to its own plan. After the autumn harvest begins, it can be ensured that the harvesting is timely and meticulous, and the cutting and pulling are combined to avoid losing a grain of food. (Hao Yu, Lin Kun)
    Replanted Sorghum Also Has a Good Harvest
    The Jilunzhai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiangji District, Woyang County, Anhui Province, mobilized all male and female laborers in the cooperative during the severe drought this year to replant five mu of sorghum with more than 70% missing seedlings, now averaging 257 jin per mu. However, Jiang Huayuan's 1.8 mu of sorghum near the edge of the cooperative's land only had 50% missing seedlings during the severe drought. Because the seedlings were not replanted, the average yield was only 144 jin per mu, more than 100 jin less per mu than the Jilunzhai Agricultural Production Cooperative. This year, the cooperative members also went through some ideological struggle when replanting the seedlings. At that time, some people said, "Planting sorghum in the dry is nonsense," while others said, "Planting seedlings is better than not planting." After careful accounting, everyone finally replanted the missing seedlings. A few days later, there was a welcome rain, and the replanted sorghum grew very vigorously. Ji Mingjun, who had originally doubted the replanting effect, also said: "I didn't expect the replanted sorghum to grow as well as the originally planted sorghum." Then, the cooperative members waged a tenacious struggle against natural disasters in the replanted land, and the sorghum finally maintained a good harvest. After the township learned about this, it specially convened all township cadres, mutual aid team leaders, etc. to visit, and everyone realized that full seedlings are an important factor in striving for a bumper harvest.
    Preventing Frost Damage and Protecting Autumn Crops
    Due to the heavy rainfall in Heilongjiang Province this year, the crops are generally greedy and green, and may mature later. All localities have planned to prevent frost damage. Yian and Qinggang counties have successively organized more than 300 office cadres, led by responsible comrades from the county, to go to key areas to assist district and village cadres in organizing and mobilizing the masses to prevent frost damage. Under the assistance of cadres, Changxing Village in the Second District of Yian organized more than 60 people to pile up firewood, topped with Artemisia annua seeds, along the roadsides, cemeteries, land grids, and mao roads, preparing to light fires and release smoke when frost occurs. Soybeans account for about one-third of the county's cultivated area in Nehe County. The county is now concentrating its efforts on beating soybean leaves and pinching tips to promote early maturity and prevent frost damage. The fifth, seventh, and thirteenth districts and other areas with high frost damage threats have established frost prevention headquarters to organize the masses to transport firewood for gathering fires to the fields. The headquarters has dedicated personnel to monitor climate changes at night. Every household in Xiangyang Village in the Fourteenth District has prepared firewood and piled it in the fields. The Ma Qingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative lent all the wheat straw after threshing wheat to nearby farmers to prevent frost.
    Farmers in some areas of Kangle, Jingyuan, Wuwei, Gaolan, Yongdeng and other counties in Gansu Province are also preparing frost prevention firewood and stepping up autumn protection. Farmers in the Sixth District of Wuwei are also watering to promote the growth of autumn crops and strive to avoid frost disasters.
    Strengthen Field Management and Strive for a Bumper Harvest of Miscellaneous Grains
    Due to the impact of drought this year, the harvest of some rice in Zhejiang Province has suffered some losses. Farmers urgently demand to grow more miscellaneous grains and strive for increased production of miscellaneous grains. Recently, some areas in Jinhua, Quzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou and other special districts have generally convened symposiums of experienced farmers and activists in production, with the district, township or village as a unit, to discuss issues such as planting miscellaneous grains and striving for increased production of miscellaneous grains. At the symposiums held in various places, many specific methods were studied. For example, for fields that cannot be cultivated due to drought, some township farmers have studied how to draw stream water and cart pond water to irrigate and cultivate the fields, or use hoes to punch holes and cover them with ash before planting. Some fields can be changed to plant buckwheat, carrots, white radishes, autumn potatoes, and various vegetables. The planting methods for various autumn crops and how to do a good job in field management have also been studied locally. For example, farmers in Tuanshi Township, Longyou County, have studied a method to increase buckwheat production: after the buckwheat seedlings emerge, apply three or four jin of fertilizer per mu or water them once with human manure, which can make the seedlings grow faster. When the seedlings grow to four or five inches long, they should seize the opportunity to carry out intertillage, weeding, and appropriate use of superphosphate to promote the production of more bells. At the same time, plant flower seeds in the buckwheat fields. Regarding the production of Chinese cabbages, the current main focus should be on grasping intertillage, soil cultivation, and fertilization to promote rapid flowering and fruiting. In addition, some methods have also been studied to strive for increased production of carrots, white radishes, autumn potatoes, and vegetables.

    在秋收的季节里
    “边黄边选种，边晒边入仓”
    老根据地四川巴中县民主村的人民，今年水稻全面丰收了。全村一百四十五户人家，今年种了水稻七百二十三亩，平均每亩收四百五十四斤，比去年每亩增产五十六斤。在收获季节里，一片金黄色的稻田，一田赛一田，雪白的棉花耀眼睛，庄稼人喜欢透了。秋收以前，村里刚刚结束了选举。新选出来的群众最信爱的干部，情绪特别高涨，他们广泛组织了宣传员，宣传“边黄边选种，边晒边入仓，边打边耕田”，并和党员、团员一起帮助群众抢收，使庄稼收得快，糟蹋少。（罗根）
    战胜风沙干旱获丰收
    吉林省西部长岭县的农民，正在欢欣地迎接今年空前的农业丰收和牲畜增产。长岭县西靠内蒙，北临龙江，境内是一望无际的大平原，平原上起伏着大小七十二个坨子（即流动性沙丘），每当春秋两季，就从内蒙平原上吹过来干燥的风沙，刮得对面不见人。风沙、干旱和野兽是长岭最大的灾害。但是解放了的长岭人民却想尽各种办法改造自然环境，使农业产量不断提高，牲畜繁殖在不断增加，人民的生活逐年都在改善。今年长岭县推广了肇源丰产经验，改变过去广种、薄收、粗放的耕作方法，实行等距、宽播、间苗和追肥，在春夏期间，又战胜了干旱和兽害，全县呈现着空前未有的丰收景象。据全县预查大豆、苞米、谷子的结果统计，每垧万斤以上的高产田不下百余份，在去年计划产量基础上提高一倍的约一万四千垧，在今年计划产量基础上提高百分之五十的约三万垧，提高百分之三十的约五万垧，就是连年遭受干旱严重的八、九两区，今年庄稼也可望丰收。
    长岭县的人民今年纠正了“重农轻牧”的思想，牲畜繁殖率大大增加，全县母马妊娠率最低可达到百分之六十，今后如果保护着牲畜不流产，牲畜的增产也大有希望了。（李政德）
    熟一块就割一块
    河北省张家口专区今年天旱，庄稼比去年早熟二十天。万全、崇礼、龙关、赤城、延庆、蔚县、宣化、涿鹿等县都在开始收割早熟作物；张北、尚义、沽源、康保和商都等县秋收紧张，已经割倒一半以上。各地接受过去的教训，都注意防灾，熟一块就割一块。康保、商都和沽源等地受灾的人民，也正在积极抢收残秋，提出了“收一棵是一棵，绝不丢掉一粒粮食”的口号。当前该地亟需注意的是：对雨前割倒的庄稼和打的粮食要进行翻晒，以免霉烂，据康保县的检查，割倒的莜麦现在有好多已经发芽了。（李万军）
    高岱长互助组作好秋收准备
    吉林省蛟河县高岱长互助组根据今年秋收比较费工的特点，积极进行了秋收准备工作。他们在秋收前就召开了组员大会，决定今年在秋收前要把大车、小型农具都修补整理好，把场地扩大，道路修好，会上并要求各家检查秋收用的物资。会议开过后，他们重新组织了劳动力，全组分成两个收割队，各队都按照自己的计划，积极准备。秋收开始后，保证可以做到收割及时、细致，割和拉结合，不损失一粒粮食。（郝玉、林坤）
    补栽的高粱也有了好收成
    安徽省涡阳县江集区纪伦砦农业生产合作社，在今年旱灾严重时，发动全社男女劳动力，补栽齐了缺苗百分之七十以上的五亩高粱，现在每亩平均收了二百五十七斤。而靠近该社地边江化远家的一亩八分高粱，在旱灾严重时才缺苗百分之五十，因为没有补苗，结果每亩平均只收了一百四十四斤多，每亩比纪伦砦农业生产合作社少收了一百多斤。今年在补苗时，该社社员也是经过一番思想斗争的，当时有的人说“干栽高粱是胡闹”，有的却说“栽苗总比不栽强”，经过算细账后，大家终于补齐缺苗。过不几天，下了一场喜雨，补栽的高粱长得很旺盛，原来怀疑补栽效果的纪明俊也说了：“没有料到栽的高粱和种的高粱长得一样好。”接着，社员们在补栽的地里又和自然灾害作了顽强的斗争，高粱终于保住了好收成。乡里知道这件事以后，特别召集了全乡干部、互助组长等去参观，大家都认识到全苗是争取丰收的重要因素。
    预防霜害保护秋禾
    黑龙江省由于今年雨水多，庄稼普遍贪青，成熟可能较晚，各地已有计划地预防霜害袭击。依安、青岗两县先后组织了三百多名机关干部，由县里负责同志率领，分赴重点区协助区村干部组织、动员群众预防霜害。依安二区长兴村在干部帮助下，组织了六十多人，在地边大道上、坟地、地格子、毛道上都堆满了柴火，上面压上青蒿子，准备下霜时点火放烟。讷河县大豆约占全县大田面积三分之一，该县现在集中力量打大豆叶子、掐尖，催促早熟，预防霜害。该县五、七、十三等霜害威胁大的区，都成立了防霜指挥部，组织群众把拢火用的柴草运到地头，指挥部有专人在夜间掌握气候变化情况。十四区向阳村家家户户都准备了柴草，在地头堆好。马庆福农业生产合作社把打完小麦的麦秸全部借给附近农民防霜。
    甘肃省的康乐、靖远、武威、皋兰、永登等县部分地区的农民也都准备防霜柴草，加紧保秋。武威六区农民并浇水促使秋禾成长，争取避免霜灾。
    加强田间管理争取杂粮丰收
    浙江省今年因天旱的影响，部分水稻的收成受到一些损失，农民迫切要求多种杂粮，并争取杂粮增产。最近，金华、衢州、宁波、温州等专区的部分地区，普遍以区、乡或村为单位，召开了在生产中有经验的农民、积极分子座谈会，讨论种植杂粮和争取杂粮增产等问题。在各地召开的座谈会上，研究出了许多具体办法。如因旱耕不转，不能种的田，有的乡农民就研究出引溪水、车塘水来灌水耕田，或用锄头打孔，盖灰种下。有些田可以改种荞麦、红萝卜、白萝卜、秋马铃薯及各种蔬菜。对于各种秋作物种植的方法和如何搞好田间管理，各地也因地制宜地进行了研究。如龙游县团石乡农民研究出增产荞麦的办法：待荞麦出苗后，每亩施用三、四斤肥田粉或用人粪尿浇一次，可使苗长得快。待苗长到四、五寸长时，就应抓紧时机进行中耕除草和适当使用过磷酸钙，以促其多生铃。并同时在荞麦田里种上花草籽。关于包萝的生产，目前主要应抓紧中耕培土和施肥，促使其迅速开花结果。另外，对争取红萝卜、白萝卜、秋马铃薯及蔬菜的增产，也都研究出了一些办法。
