(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 22nd) Korean People's Army prisoners-of-war Kim Kyu-seop and Kim Taek-kyu, who returned after breaking through secret agent control, revealed to reporters that before the U.S. side handed over non-directly repatriated prisoners-of-war to neutral nations for custody, it established new secret agent organizations within the prisoner-of-war camps to intensify control over the prisoners and sabotage the neutral nations' custodial work and the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work.

Kim Kyu-seop and Kim Taek-kyu were originally detained in the 7th compound of the 1st Prisoner-of-War Camp in Nonsan. They escaped the clutches of the Lee Syngman bandit secret agents on September 16th when they were handed over to the neutral nations for custody and returned. Kim Kyu-seop said that in late August, after two American officers threatened them to obey the command of the secret agents, a large number of Lee Syngman puppet army officers came to the prisoner-of-war camp. Three Lee Syngman puppet army lieutenants came to the 7th compound. They carried out various conspiracies in the prisoner-of-war camp to sabotage the neutral nations' custodial work and our side's explanation work. On the morning of September 1st, Lee Syngman bandit secret agent Kim Jeong-hee gathered all the prisoners in the entire compound and threatened them, saying, "Now is the most urgent moment. Soon you will be taken over by the neutral nations. To prevent disunity and ensure unified action, a military organization—the General Staff—must be established. Any orders must be executed immediately, and anyone who does not execute them will be dealt with according to military law!" Then, this secret agent announced that he was the Chief of the General Staff, and the original secret agent team leader Han Kuk-bok was the Chief of Operations.

These secret agents forced our captured personnel to tattoo characters on their bodies. Kim Taek-kyu angrily revealed the "Exterminate Communism" tattoo on his arm and said, "Look, this is what Han Kuk-bok forced me to tattoo on September 3rd. He threatened us, saying, 'Anyone who doesn't tattoo will lose his life!'"

Kim Kyu-seop and Kim Taek-kyu also said that on September 9th, this so-called "General Staff" distributed a large number of paints and white cloths sent by Lee Syngman puppet army officers to everyone, forcing the prisoners to make flags and slogans, and use white cloth to make headbands printed with the Lee Syngman bandit Taegukgi flag and the words "Exterminate Communism." On the 16th, when the prisoners walked into the neutral nations' receiving point, the secret agent Han Kuk-bok forced the prisoners to hold these Taegukgi flags and wear these headbands.

Another returnee, Wu Haoyuan, also said that a similar new secret agent organization was established at the same time in the 6th compound of the 1st Prisoner-of-War Camp in Nonsan where he was originally located. He said that those secret agent elements forbade the prisoners from talking to each other on the train and after entering the neutral nations' custodial camp, and they were not allowed to act individually. The secret agents also made four colors of "command flags" in red, yellow, blue, and white, which were used to command actions such as "singing," "shouting slogans," and "throwing stones." On the afternoon of the 15th and the morning of the 16th, the secret agents used these "command flags" to force the prisoners to throw stones at the Korean-Chinese observation representatives. Wu Haoyuan said that after entering the new camp in the demilitarized zone, those secret agents reorganized the prisoners from teams of eighty to teams of thirty, and guarded and monitored the prisoners' actions near the barbed wire day and night to prevent the prisoners from expressing their desire for repatriation to the Indian custodial forces. After Wu Haoyuan broke through the secret agent control and climbed over the barbed wire to escape on the morning of the 17th, he immediately reported the situation of the Lee Syngman bandit secret agents controlling the prisoners in the camp to the Indian custodial forces officers.

    美方派遣大批特务混入战俘营破坏解释工作
    【新华社开城二十二日电】突破特务控制归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员金圭爕、金泽奎向记者揭露：美方在将不直接遣返战俘移交给中立国看管前，在战俘中建立起新的特务组织，以便加紧控制战俘，并破坏中立国的看管工作和朝中方面的解释工作。
    金圭爕等二人原被拘禁在论山第一战俘营第七营场。他们是在九月十六日移交给中立国看管时逃出李匪特务魔掌后回来的。金圭爕说，八月下旬，在两个美国军官威胁他们要听从特务指挥以后，战俘营中就来了大批李伪军军官。到第七营场的，就有三个李伪军中尉。他们在战俘中进行了破坏中立国看管工作和我方解释工作的各种阴谋活动。九月一日晨，李匪特务金正熙就把全营场的战俘召集在一起，威胁他们说：“现在已经到了最紧急的时候，不久你们便要由中立国接管。为防止涣散，保证行动一致，必须建立军事组织——参谋部，有命令下来就要立即执行，谁不执行，便按军法办理！”然后，这个特务便宣布自己是总参谋长，原特务队队长韩国福为作战参谋长。
    这些特务强迫在我方被俘人员身上刺字，金泽奎愤怒地露出刺在他臂上的“灭共”字样说：“看，这就是韩国福在九月三日强迫给我刺上的。他曾威胁我们说：‘谁不刺，就要他的命！’”
    金圭爕和金泽奎又说，九月九日这个所谓“参谋部”把李伪军军官送来的大批颜料、白布发给大家，强迫战俘们做旗子、标语，并用白布做印有李匪太极旗和“灭共”字样的头巾。十六日，在战俘们走进中立国接收地点时，特务韩国福就强迫战俘们举着这些太极旗，并缠着这些头巾。
    另一个归来人员吴浩渊也说，他原在的论山第一战俘营第六营场也有类似的新特务组织在同时成立。他说，那些特务分子禁止战俘在火车上及进入中立国看管营地后互相交谈，不准他们个别行动。特务们并做了红、黄、青、白四种颜色的“指挥旗”，分别用来指挥“唱歌”、“喊口号”、“投石块”等行动。在十五日下午和十六日上午，特务们就用这种“指挥旗”强迫战俘向朝中观察代表投掷石块。吴浩渊说，在进入非军事区新营场后，那些特务们又将战俘从八十个人一队改编为三十个人一队，并在铁丝网附近日夜放哨监视战俘的行动，防止战俘向印度看管部队表示要求遣返的意愿。吴浩渊在十七日晨突破特务控制攀越铁丝网逃出来后，就立刻向印度看管部队军官报告了营场内李匪特务控制战俘的情况。
