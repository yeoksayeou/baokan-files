Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, September 5th: This year's first half of the Huai River project has been successfully completed. After several years of management, the main stream of the Huai River and dozens of tributaries have been initially brought under flood control. To date, the completed flood storage projects can control approximately 16 billion cubic meters of Huai River floodwater. The people along the Huai River have been initially freed from flood disasters.

This year's first half of the Huai River project was carried out on the basis of the victories of the past two years. The requirements of the project remained to continue controlling the Huai River floods, and to manage the river channels and eliminate waterlogging disasters. In terms of flood control this year, two large-scale flood storage projects were completed: one is the Hongze Lake flood storage project at the junction of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. With the completion of the magnificent Sanhe Sluice in late July, Hongze Lake has become a huge reservoir, capable of storing 4 billion cubic meters of water in normal years. The crops on the northern Jiangsu Plain will henceforth have reliable protection. The other is the Menghe Depression flood storage project between Henan and Anhui. Now, the Wangjiaba water gate at the inlet of the Menghe Depression has been built. The Menghe Depression flood storage project, in conjunction with the Xihu Lake west of Huoqiu County, the Donghu Lake east of the city, and the Wabu Lake in Shouxian County, which have been completed in the past two years, will play a major role in eliminating floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River. In addition to vigorously developing lake and depression flood storage projects, three valley reservoirs, Nanwan, Boshan, and Fozi Ridge, continued to be built in the first half of this year. The tunnels of the Nanwan and Boshan reservoirs in Henan Province have been opened, and tunnel lining is now underway. The concrete dam body of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir in Anhui Province is being poured. All three reservoirs are continuing to be constructed intensively.

In terms of river channel management, Henan and Anhui provinces continued to manage more than 20 tributaries, including the Hong River, Ying River, Hei River, Bao River, Quan River, Gang River, North Fei River, and Sui River. A total of 100 million cubic meters of earthwork was completed. The management of these Huai River tributaries has created conditions for further eliminating waterlogging disasters in the entire Huai River basin in the future. In order to prepare for the fundamental elimination of waterlogging in the Huai River basin, the Huai River Commission organized a surveying team of more than 2,000 people to conduct surveys on the Henan-Anhui Plain. The first phase of the survey has now been completed, covering 19,000 square kilometers. At the same time, the drainage and irrigation demonstration project launched by the Huai River Commission on both sides of the North Fei River in Anhui Province has now completed the first phase of its construction plan and has achieved results.

In order to develop the shipping industry in the Huai River basin, five ship locks were built in Runheji in Anhui Province and Gaoliangjian, Taizhou, Xiannvmiao, and Huaian in Jiangsu Province in the first half of this year. These ship locks have changed the face of the shipping industry in the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River.

A total of 1.5 million laborers and workers participated in the Huai River project in the first half of this year. They all displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in the construction, and a large number of model workers emerged. More than 180 model workers were selected at the Fozi Ridge Reservoir construction site. More than 120 special-class and first-class model workers were selected at the Sanhe Sluice construction site.

    今年上半年的治淮工程胜利完工
    一百五十万民工和工人发挥了高度的积极性和创造性
    【新华社蚌埠五日电】今年上半年的治淮工程已胜利完工。淮河干流和几十条支流经过几年的整理，洪水已被初步控制起来。到目前止，已完成的拦蓄洪水的工程，约可控制淮河洪水达一百六十亿立方公尺。淮河沿岸人民初步解脱了洪水灾害。
    今年上半年的治淮工程是在过去两年多来的胜利基础上继续进行的。工程的要求仍然是继续控制淮河洪水，并整理河道、清除内涝的灾害。今年上半年在控制洪水方面，完成了两处大规模的蓄洪工程：一处是安徽和江苏交界的洪泽湖蓄洪工程。今年七月下旬兴建好雄伟的三河闸，洪泽湖便变成一个巨大的蓄水库，平常年份可以蓄水四十亿立方公尺。江苏省北部平原上的庄稼，从此得到了可靠的保障。另一处是河南和安徽之间的濛河洼地蓄洪工程。现在，濛河洼地进水口的王家坝，已经造好一座巨大的王家坝水闸。濛河洼地蓄洪工程配合过去两年已修成的霍邱县城西湖、城东湖和寿县瓦埠湖等蓄洪工程，对消除淮河中、下游的水灾，将起重大的作用。今年上半年除大力举办了湖泊洼地蓄洪工程外，并继续兴建了南湾、薄山、佛子岭等三座山谷水库。河南省南湾、薄山两个水库的隧道已经打通，现正在做隧道衬砌工程。安徽省佛子岭水库混凝土的坝身正在浇筑。三座水库都在继续紧张施工。
    今年上半年在整理河道工程方面，河南和安徽两省继续整理了洪河、颍河、黑河、包河、泉河、港河、北淝河、濉河等二十多条支流。共做土方工程达一亿公方。这些淮河支流的整理，已为将来整个淮河流域进一步消除内涝灾害创造了条件。为了作好淮河流域根除内涝的准备工作，今年上半年治淮委员会组织了二千多人的测量队，在豫皖平原上进行了测量。现在已完成第一期测量任务，测量好一万九千平方公里。与此同时，治淮委员会在安徽省北淝河两岸举办的排涝灌溉示范工程，现在已完成第一期施工计划，并获得了成效。
    为了发展淮河流域的航运事业，今年上半年在安徽省的润河集和江苏省的高良涧、泰州、仙女庙、淮安等五处建造了五个船闸。这些船闸已使淮河中、下游的航运事业改观。
    参加今年上半年治淮工程的民工和工人共达一百五十万人。他们在施工中都发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，涌现出大批劳动模范。佛子岭水库工地评选出的劳动模范达一百八十多人。三河闸工地评选出的特等劳动模范和一等劳动模范共一百二十多人。
