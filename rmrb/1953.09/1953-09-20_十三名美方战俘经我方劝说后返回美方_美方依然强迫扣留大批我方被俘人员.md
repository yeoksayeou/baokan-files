Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 19th: The Korean-Chinese side repatriated twelve ROK army POWs and one Turkish POW to the U.S. side on the 19th. These POWs had temporarily remained with our side during the previous repatriation of POWs because they were unwilling to return to the other side. They were willing to return home only after repeated persuasion by our personnel.

　　The Turkish POW, Kapukiber, who was repatriated on the 19th, told reporters why he was unwilling to be repatriated. He said that he lived a life of poverty in his own country, earning only sixty lira (Turkish currency) for a month's work, and often couldn't eat meat even once a week. But he lived well in the POW camp, and could eat meat and vegetables almost every meal. He was often beaten and scolded in the Turkish army, but received humane treatment on our side. Therefore, he was unwilling to be repatriated. Later, Kapukiber, because he was concerned about the life of his old mother, finally listened to the persuasion of the Korean-Chinese side and decided to go back.

　　Among the ROK army POWs who were repatriated, there was a POW named Li Guangyuan. He was illiterate before being captured, but learned to read and write in the POW camp on the Korean-Chinese side and can now write letters. He personally saw the people of northern Korea loving peace and preparing to rebuild their country. He originally wanted to stay and work as a construction worker. However, the Korean-Chinese side knew that his family in southern Korea was in a miserable situation, their houses had been burned down, and his parents and wife had no food or clothing. Therefore, they sympathized with his plight and hoped that he could go back to support his family. After several conversations, Li Guangyuan decided to return.

　　Among these repatriated POWs, three of them did not decide to go home until the evening of the 18th, after persuasion from the Korean-Chinese side.

　　At 9:30 a.m. on the 19th, these POWs left the Korean-Chinese reception station to go to Panmunjom. They shook hands with the staff of the Korean-Chinese side one by one to say goodbye. One of the POWs even burst into tears, and only got on the truck after being comforted by the staff. The staff of the Korean-Chinese side wished them a safe journey and hoped that they would reunite with their families soon. The truck drove a long way, and they waved their hats to the staff of the Korean-Chinese side. At 11 o'clock, they arrived at the U.S. reception area in Panmunjom, and uneasily got out of the car under the stern gaze of the U.S. military police. They tightly grasped a small bag and looked around in panic as they entered the U.S. reception tent. The small bag was a Red Cross care package received in the Korean-Chinese POW camp, containing various items issued by the Red Cross and the Korean-Chinese side.

　　In stark contrast to the Korean-Chinese side's persuasion of POWs not directly repatriated by the U.S. to return home, the U.S. violated the provisions of the armistice agreement and continued to forcibly detain at least 340 Korean-Chinese POWs who insisted on repatriation. The U.S. also violated its promise made on September 5th and did not repatriate a group of Korean-Chinese POWs who insisted on repatriation to the Korean-Chinese side. At the same time, the U.S. is using Kuomintang and Rhee Syngman gang secret agents to do everything possible to prevent Korean-Chinese POWs who are classified as not directly repatriated from expressing their desire to return home. The sixteen Korean-Chinese POWs who were recently returned and classified by the U.S. as not directly repatriated, all escaped from the hands of secret agents at the risk of their lives. From this comparison, it is clear who truly respects the rights and will of the POWs.

    十三名美方战俘经我方劝说后返回美方
    美方依然强迫扣留大批我方被俘人员
    【新华社开城十九日电】朝中方面在十九日遣送了十二名李承晚伪军战俘和一名土耳其籍战俘给美方。这些战俘在上次遣返战俘期间，都因不愿回到对方而暂时留了下来，经过我方人员的多次劝说以后，他们才愿意回家。
    十九日遣返的土耳其籍战俘卡浦基勃曾把他不愿被遣返的原因告诉记者。他说，他在本国时过着不能温饱的生活，做一个月工只能赚六十里拉（土耳其货币名称），往往一星期吃不上一顿肉。但在战俘营里他生活得很好，几乎每一顿饭都可吃到肉类和青菜。他在土耳其军中时常受到打骂，在我方则受到人道的待遇。因此他不愿遣返。后来卡浦基勃由于挂念他的老母亲的生活，终于听从了朝中方面的劝说，决定回去。
    被遣返的李伪军战俘中，有一个名叫李光渊的战俘，他在被俘前是文盲，被俘以后在朝中方面的战俘营里学习了文化，现在已经能够写信了。他亲眼看到朝鲜北部人民热爱和平、准备重建祖国的情形，原想留下来作一个建筑工人。但朝中方面知道他的在朝鲜南部的家庭正处在悲惨的境地，房舍已被烧毁，他的父母妻子都衣食无着，因此非常同情他的遭遇，希望他能够回去养活家人。经过多次谈话以后，李光渊才决定回去。
    在这些被遣返的战俘中，有三个人直到十八日晚上，在朝中方面劝说之下才决定回家去。
    十九日上午九点半钟，这些战俘离开朝中方面的接待站准备到板门店去。他们一一和朝中方面的工作人员握手告别，其中有一个战俘甚至痛哭失声，经过工作人员的劝慰后才登上卡车。朝中方面工作人员纷纷祝他们一路平安，并希望他们早日与家人团聚。车子开走了很远，他们还挥舞着帽子向朝中方面工作人员致意。十一点钟，他们到达板门店美方的接收区，在美方宪兵的严厉注视下，不安地走下车去。他们紧紧地握着一个小口袋惶然四顾地进入美方的接收帐篷。那个小口袋是在朝中战俘营里领到的红十字会的慰问袋，里面装着红十字会和朝中方面所发的各种物品。
    和朝中方面这种劝说美方不直接遣返战俘回家的情形完全相反，美方违反停战协定的规定，继续强迫扣留了至少三百四十名坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员。美方并且违背他们在九月五日所作的诺言，没有将一批坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员遣送给朝中方面。同时，美方正在利用国民党和李承晚匪帮特务，想尽一切办法，不许被列为不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员表达他们要求回家的意愿。最近归来的十六名被美方列为不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员，都是冒着生命危险，从特务手中逃出来的。人们从这个对比中可以清楚地看出，真正尊重战俘权利和意志的究竟是谁。
