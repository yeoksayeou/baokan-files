What Issues Should Be Noted When Promoting Close Planting of Wheat

The Grain Production Division of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government

The results of focusing on promoting close planting of wheat in various regions over the past year have fully confirmed that this advanced experience is currently the simplest, easiest, most economical, and most effective method of increasing production. Many regions have listed the implementation of close planting as one of the important technical measures for increasing wheat production next year, which is entirely correct. However, in order to achieve the effect of promoting close planting, it is necessary to implement the policy of active and steady promotion. It is necessary to oppose the attitude of laissez-faire and non-active promotion, and also to prevent any hasty and rash compulsory command practices. When promoting close planting of wheat, the following issues should be noted:

Agricultural environments vary from place to place, and the level of cultivation is also inconsistent, so the methods of close planting should also be different. It is not feasible to subjectively prescribe a set of methods and force the masses to accept them. Therefore, when promoting close planting of wheat in various regions, it is necessary to promote local, practical close planting methods in accordance with local specific conditions and the original close planting experience of the masses. "Narrow-row uniform sowing dense planting" and "wide-band uniform sowing dense planting" are two basic methods of close planting of wheat. In the original drilling areas, the promotion of "narrow-row uniform sowing dense planting" should be the main focus. In the southern rice-wheat double-cropping areas, as well as areas where wheat and miscellaneous grains or cotton must be intercropped, narrow-row strip sowing is difficult, or a certain width of row spacing must be maintained to allow miscellaneous grains or cotton to grow, then "wide-band uniform sowing dense planting" can be promoted to expand the sowing area of each row; in some areas in the north with convenient water conservancy conditions, which originally had the habit of "wide-band uniform sowing dense planting", this method can also be appropriately expanded on the original basis, but it is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of widening the row spacing while widening the sowing width. In the original hole-sowing areas, the hole spacing can be reduced, and the number of planting holes can be appropriately increased. If conditions permit, it can be changed to strip-sowing dense planting. In the original broadcast areas, it should first be ensured that the seeds are sown evenly and the soil is covered at a consistent depth. If conditions permit, narrow-row strip sowing or wide-band uniform sowing dense planting should be gradually promoted.

When promoting close planting of wheat in various regions, it is necessary to implement the method of appropriately increasing the seeding rate, while reducing the row spacing or widening the sowing width. The experience of the past year has proved that all those who have appropriately increased the seeding rate and reduced the row spacing or widened the sowing width have achieved significant production increase effects. If these contents are separated, simply increasing the seeding rate, or simply reducing the row spacing or widening the sowing width, will reduce the yield increase effect of dense planting. According to the experiment of the Yucheng Special District Farm in Shanxi Province, each seeding rate was increased from the original 16 jin to 24 jin, and the row spacing was reduced from 10 inches to 5 inches, which can increase production by 40%. If the row spacing remains unchanged and the seeding rate is increased from 16 jin to 24 jin, the yield will increase by 26%. If the seeding rate is not increased and the row spacing is reduced from 10 inches to 5 inches, the yield will increase by 17%. Sometimes, if the seeding rate is too high, not only will it not increase production, but it will decrease production. For example, in the experiment of the Yuncheng Special District Farm in Shanxi Province, with the row spacing unchanged, increasing the seeding rate by one-third of the original amount (8 jin per mu) increased production by 6%; increasing it by two times resulted in a 4% lower yield than increasing it by one-third. The practice of the masses in various regions has also yielded results similar to these situations. What is the reason for this? Because the development of a single wheat ear has a certain limit, the so-called: "Millet three thousand, wheat sixty", in fact, the existing general wheat varieties do not have many ears that are sixty grains long. Therefore, the advanced Soviet scientific theory points out: "High wheat harvest can only be achieved when there are a large number of plants and ears per unit area." Appropriately increasing the seeding rate is to achieve the goal of increasing the total number of plants and ears. However, after increasing the number of plants, it is necessary to ensure that each plant has a certain nutritional area required for good development and growth, and that the ears are large and the grains are numerous, in order to effectively increase the yield. Therefore, close planting of wheat is not simply increasing the seeding rate in the original planting rows, but using the method of reducing the row spacing to increase the number of planting rows, or widening the sowing width to expand the sowing area to achieve the purpose of increasing the total number of plants and ears. This allows the wheat seeds to be evenly distributed and fully utilizes the soil fertility, and each wheat plant still has sufficient nutritional area to grow well. This is the simple reason why increasing the seeding rate while reducing the row spacing or widening the sowing width can generally achieve significant production increase. If close planting is turned into simply increasing the seeding rate, making the wheat plants crowded and poorly developed, production will decrease. As for why some people still increase production after simply increasing the seeding rate? This is because the original seeding rate was low, and appropriately increasing the seeding rate would not greatly affect the development of wheat plants, so it can still increase production, but the effect is small. In addition, it is also one-sided to regard dense planting as only reducing the row spacing or widening the sowing width. Although this can also increase production, the reason for the increase in production is that the nutritional area of a single plant is expanded and the number of tillers is increased. However, if there are too many tillers, the ear heads will be uneven in size, and many tillers will not produce ears, wasting soil fertility, so the goal of high-yield increase cannot be achieved.

In promoting close planting of wheat, we must pay attention to the close planting of dryland wheat. Because more than 80% of the wheat fields in my country's main wheat-producing areas are dryland wheat; only by implementing close planting on the vast drylands can we achieve the goal of generally increasing wheat production. The experience of the past year has fully proved that whether it is fertile land, water land, dry land, or thin land, appropriate close planting on the original basis can significantly increase production. In the case of general wide-row sparse planting, there are many empty spaces between the wheat rows that are not utilized, but instead give weeds the opportunity to grow, wasting water and nutrients; in addition, the row spacing is large, and direct sunlight on the ground increases the evaporation of water in the soil. Implementing close planting and utilizing these idle lands will definitely increase production. According to the experiment of Beijing Agricultural University, when densely planted wheat fields are dry, the soil only dries to more than one inch; however, sparsely planted fields reach more than two inches, which is another powerful proof. Last year, the suburbs of Beijing promoted close planting of 12,000 mu of wheat. According to the survey, the average increase in dryland wheat after implementing close planting reached 67% (this year, the water and rain are evenly distributed in the Beijing area, and the increase in dryland dense planting of wheat is particularly significant). Last year, Shi Yucheng Mutual Aid Group of Zhangzilou, Shanxian County, Shandong Province, used a 1.2-foot double-legged drill for a comparison between the nested drill and the non-nested drill in his dryland. The result was that the nested drill dense planting increased the yield by 78 jin per mu compared to the non-nested drill. There are many facts in various places that prove that dryland and thin land can be densely planted and should be promoted with certainty.

    推行小麦密植应该注意那些问题
    中央人民政府农业部粮食生产司
    一年来各地重点推行小麦密植的结果，已经完全证实了这一先进经验是当前最简而易行经济有效的增产办法，很多地区已把实行密植列为明年小麦增产的重要技术措施之一，这是完全正确的。但是为要达到推行密植的效果，必须贯彻积极而稳步的推广方针。既要反对放任自流不积极推行的态度，也要防止任何急躁冒进强迫命令的作法。在推行小麦密植时，应该注意以下的问题：
    各地农业环境不同，耕作水平也不一致，密植的办法也应有所不同。主观地规定一套办法，硬叫群众接受是行不通的。因此各地在推行小麦密植时，必须根据当地的具体条件和群众原有的密植经验，因地制宜地推行当地切实可行的密植办法。“窄行匀播密植”和“宽幅匀播密植”是小麦密植的两种基本方法。在原来耧播地区，应以推行“窄行匀播密植”为主。在南方稻麦两作地区，以及小麦和杂粮或棉花必须间作地区，窄行条播有困难，或必须保持一定宽度的行距，以便杂粮或棉花生长，那就可以推广“宽幅匀播密植”，扩大每行播种面积；北方有些水利条件方便的地区，原来有“宽幅匀播密植”的习惯，也可以在原有基础上适当扩大推行这一方法，但要防止加宽播幅后同时也加宽行距的现象。在原来穴播地区，则可缩小穴距，适当增加种植穴数，有条件时，可改为条播密植。在原来撒播地区，则应先做到均匀撒种，复土深浅一致，有条件时，再逐步推行窄行条播或宽幅匀播密植。
    各地推行小麦密植时，必须实行适当增加播种量，同时缩小行距或加宽播幅的方法。一年来的经验证明，凡是适当增加了播种量，而又缩小了行距或加宽播幅的，都获得了显著增产效果。如果把这些内容割裂开来，单纯增加播种量，或单纯缩小行距、加宽播幅，就会减低密植增产效果。据山西省榆次专区农场的试验，每次播种量由原来十六斤增至二十四斤，行距由十寸缩小至五寸，可增产百分之四十。行距不变，播种量由十六斤增至二十四斤，增产百分之二十六。播种量不增加，行距由十寸缩小至五寸，增产百分之十七。有时播种量过于增多，不仅不能增产，反而减产。如山西省运城专区农场的试验：行距不变，播种量较原有数（每亩八斤）增加三分之一的，增产百分之六；增加二倍的，较增加三分之一的反而少收百分之四。各地群众实践也都得到了和这些情况类似的结果。这是什么原因呢？因为小麦单穗发育是有一定限度的，所谓：“粟三千，麦六十”，实际上现有一般小麦品种，每穗长六十粒的也并不多。所以苏联先进的科学理论指出：“小麦高度的收获，只有在单位面积上有大量株穗时才能达到。”适当增加播种量，就是为了达到增多总株穗数目的。但是，增加种植株数后，必须保证每一植株发育生长良好所需要的一定营养面积，达到穗大粒多，才能有效提高产量。所以小麦密植不是简单地在原来播种行中增加播种量，而是要用缩小行距以增加种植行数，或加宽播幅以扩大播种面的办法来达到增加总株穗数的目的。这样可使麦种均匀分布，充分利用地力，每一麦株仍有足够营养面积，能够生长良好。这就是为什么增加播种量，同时缩小行距或加宽播幅后能普遍获得显著增产的简单道理。如果把密植变成单纯增加播种量，使麦株密挤，发育不良，就会减产。至于为什么有些单纯增加播种量后仍又能增产呢？这是因为原来播种量较少，而适当增加一些播种量尚不致很大影响麦株发育，所以尚能增产，但效果较小。另外把密植看成仅是缩小行距或加宽播幅也是片面的，这样固然也可以提高产量，但增产原因是由于扩大了单株营养面积，增多了分蘖的缘故。但如果分蘖过多，穗头便会大小不齐，还有不少分蘖会莠不出穗，白消耗地力，这样就达不到高额增产的目的。
    在推行小麦密植中，要重视旱地小麦的密植。因为我国主要麦产区，有百分之八十以上的麦田是旱地小麦；只有在广大的旱地上实行了密植，才能达到普遍提高小麦产量的目的。一年来的经验充分证明，无论肥地、水地、旱地、薄地，在原有基础上适当密植都可显著增产。在一般宽行稀植的情况下，麦行间有很多空地没有被利用，反而给杂草生长机会，白消耗了水分和养料；加以行间空地多，阳光直射地面，更增加了土壤里的水分蒸发。而实行密植，把这些空闲地利用起来，是一定能增产的。又据北京农业大学的实验，密植小麦田干旱时，土壤只干到一寸多；但稀植的却达到二寸多，这又是一个有力证明。北京市郊区去年推广小麦密植一万二千亩，据调查旱地小麦实行密植后平均增产达到百分之六十七（今年北京地区水雨调匀，旱地密植小麦增产特别显著）。山东单县张子楼史雨成互助组去年在他旱地里用一尺二寸的双腿耧作了套耧不套耧的对比，结果套耧密植的比不套耧的每亩增产七十八斤。各地都有很多事实证明，旱地薄地可以密植，应该肯定地加以推行。
