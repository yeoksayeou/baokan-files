Sublime Love
Xie Juezai

The conditions for love in bourgeois society are money and beauty. Love in a people's democratic society is "as a partner for common life" (Article 7 of the Marriage Law); for "mutual love and respect, mutual assistance, mutual support, harmonious unity, labor and production, raising children, and striving together for family happiness and the construction of a new society" (Article 8 of the Marriage Law).

Love in bourgeois society is not solid: "Friendships based on wealth will dissolve when money is gone, and love based on beauty will wane when beauty fades." In people's democratic society, with the progress of social undertakings, the progress of individual work, and the unity of individual interests and social interests, love for individuals and love for the country become unified, resulting in a noble, sincere, solid, and new scene of love between husband and wife.

We have already seen many progressive men and women in factories, mines, villages, and organizations forming happy marriages because of their joint efforts in work, especially in the patriotic War of Liberation and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, where we have seen even more moving facts. For example: Gao Guizhen, the model military dependent and fiancée of Volunteer soldier Dong Shigui who attended the Second National Women's Congress. Both of them were peasants who had been emancipated. Dong Shigui was a Communist Party member who had performed meritorious service at the front. Gao Guizhen was the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in the village and did a very good job. Dong's father was afraid that Gao would change her mind and wrote to Dong asking him to come back and get married. Gao Guizhen immediately ran to Dong's house and said, "Dad! Don't worry! I will never change my mind. Even if he is disabled, I will marry him. I am only twenty this year, and he is only twenty-three. We are not old. We will get married after the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea." After that, Gao Guizhen often went to Dong's house to help them farm and serve Shigui's parents. Under Gao's influence, Liu Xiulan, Hao Yumin, Chen Fengying, Tian Shuzhen, and Du Yuzhen in the village all sent their fiancés to join the army and often communicated with each other and encouraged each other. Now they are all actively engaged in production and study and have become activists in the village. (See "New Chinese Women," No. 5). Another example: Li Jingyun, a model military dependent in Zhengzhou, had been married to her husband, Mao Yuan, for less than a year when Mao Yuan joined the army. Encouraged by her husband Mao Yuan's letters, Li Jingyun actively participated in work and worked hard in production. Mao Yuan was wounded in the War of Liberation, lost his left arm, and became disabled. Li Jingyun wrote a letter saying, "You were wounded and disabled for the country, which is glorious... I will always be with you."

Women are like this to men, and men are also like this to women.

On April 23, the Northeast Daily published an article titled "What is True Love?" The article said: Su Jingxian was Wang Zuomin's fiancée. In 1951, she participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. In the Fifth Battle, her right leg was seriously injured. When she was transferred to the rear hospital, her injured leg had turned black, and the doctor decided to perform an amputation. When she woke up from her coma and knew that she only had one leg left, she was very sad, which would bring her many difficulties in her future work, especially her relationship with Wang Zuomin. She thought: "He is so young and capable, can he still love a disabled person with a missing leg?" But she finally wrote to inform Wang Zuomin. Zuomin immediately wrote back, saying: "I know that you have been gloriously wounded. You shed your bright red blood for the safety of the motherland and world peace... Everyone here admires you infinitely, and I am also honored to have such a lover like you… I also want to tell you one thing: From now on, I will love you even more." Wang Zuomin and Su Jingxian got married last October. On Beisanmalu Road in Shenyang, people often see a close young couple walking by. The woman wears a dazzling "War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Medal" on her chest and walks with crutches; the man supports her caringly beside her. This is the young couple, Communist Party member Wang Zuomin and Communist Youth League member Su Jingxian, praised by everyone in the Northeast Grain Administration.

Such noble love, forged in work and in battle, integrates the love for individuals with the love for the country, society, and nation. Their love is not built on appearance and body, but on the noble ideal of striving for the construction of a new society, which enables them to contribute more to the cause of social construction, and thus increases the happiness of their lives.

A noble society produces noble people, and noble people produce noble feelings. Article 19 of the Marriage Law on the marriage of revolutionary soldiers is only a negative aspect. Many women or men in the marriages of revolutionary soldiers have already surpassed this aspect. We should move forward and learn from model military couples.

    崇高的爱情
    谢觉哉
    资产阶级社会爱情的条件为金钱与美貌。人民民主社会的爱情：“为共同生活的伴侣”（婚姻法第七条）；为“互爱互敬、互相帮助、互相扶养、和睦团结、劳动生产、抚育子女，为家庭幸福和新社会建设而共同奋斗”（婚姻法第八条）。
    资产阶级社会的爱情是不巩固的：“金尽交疏，色衰爱弛”。人民民主社会则随着社会事业的进步，个人工作的进步，个人利益与社会利益的一致，因而对个人爱情与对国家爱情亦一致起来而出现了高尚的、诚挚的、巩固的、新的夫妻间的爱情场面。
    我们已经在厂矿中、农村中、机关中看到不少进步的男女因为工作的共同努力而结成美满姻缘，尤其在爱国的解放战争中、抗美援朝战争中，看到更为动人的事实。比如：出席第二次全国妇女代表大会的模范军属——志愿军董世贵的未婚妻高桂珍，他俩都是翻身农民，董世贵是共产党员，在前方立了功；高桂珍是村的青年团支部书记，工作做得很好，董的父亲怕高变心，写信要董回来结婚。高桂珍听了即跑到董家说：“爹！你放心吧！我决不变心，他就是残废了，我也和他结婚。我今年才二十，他才二十三，我们年纪都不大，等抗美援朝胜利了再结婚。”以后，高桂珍就经常到董家去，帮助他们种地，并侍奉世贵的父母。在高的影响下，该村刘秀兰、郝玉敏、陈凤英、田淑珍、杜玉珍都送自己的未婚夫参军了，并经常通信，互相鼓励。现在她们都积极生产、学习，成了村中积极分子。（参看新中国妇女第五号）又如：郑州市模范军属李景云与其爱人毛渊结婚不到一年，毛渊就参军了。李景云在其爱人毛渊的通信鼓励下，积极参加工作，努力生产，毛渊在解放战争中负伤，失去左胳膊，成了残废。李景云去信说：“你为了祖国，受伤残废，这是光荣的……我要永远和你在一起。”
    女性对男性这样，男性对女性也是这样。
    四月二十三日，东北日报登了一篇标题为“什么是真正的爱情”的文章。文中说：苏静娴是王佐民的未婚妻，一九五一年参加了抗美援朝工作。在第五次战役中她的右腿负了重伤，辗转送到后方医院时，伤腿已经发黑，医生决定动手术截肢。当她从昏迷中醒来，知道自己只剩下一条腿时，非常难过，这将给她今后的工作带来许多困难，尤其是和王佐民的关系。她想：“他那样年青能干，难道还能再爱这样一个缺腿的残废人？”但她终于写信告知了王佐民。佐民即时来信，说：“知道你已经光荣负伤。你为了祖国安全和世界和平，流下了鲜红的热血，……我们这里每个人都对你无限钦敬，我也为有你这样的一个爱人感到光荣。……我还要告诉你一句：从今后我将会更加爱你。”去年十月王佐民和苏静娴结婚了。在沈阳北三马路上，人们常看到走过的一对亲密的青年男女，女的胸前戴着耀眼的“抗美援朝纪念章”，走路架着双拐；男的在一旁关切地扶持着她。这便是东北粮食管理局里人人称赞的一对青年夫妇——共产党员王佐民和青年团员苏静娴。
    像这样从工作中从战斗中锻炼出的高尚的爱情，把对个人的爱与对国家、社会、民族的爱融合在一起，他们的爱情不是建筑在面貌与肢体上，而是建筑在为新社会建设奋斗的高尚理想的基础上，这就使得他们更能为社会建设事业尽力，也因而就更增加了他们生活的幸福。
    高尚的社会产生高尚的人，高尚的人产生高尚的感情。婚姻法第十九条关于革命军人婚姻问题的规定，只是消极的一面，许多革命军人婚姻的女方或男方，早已超过了这一面。我们应该前进，向模范的军人夫妻看齐。
