    Record of Annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Paratroopers Landing on Dongshan Island
    In mid-July, the heroic People's Liberation Army and the local people, together, annihilated more than 3,000 remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandits who had sneaked into Dongshan Island, Fujian Province, and also cleanly and thoroughly annihilated more than 200 Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers.
    Although this group of paratroopers was insignificant, it was Chiang Kai-shek's "capital." They had all undergone long-term, meticulous training by U.S. imperialism, and were equipped with American gear from head to toe. Many of them had begun parachute training during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and some were already "veterans" of more than ten years. Before this intrusion into Dongshan Island, the Chiang Kai-shek gang painstakingly pieced them together within the paratrooper ranks, and then concentrated them for specialized training. According to captured Chiang Kai-shek paratrooper Second Lieutenant Platoon Leader Zhang Yongchun and Second Lieutenant Platoon Leader Zhang Jianmin, before the Chiang Kai-shek bandits intruded into Dongshan Island, the U.S. imperialist so-called military advisory group in Taiwan became nervous and gave the Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers "emergency lessons," teaching them so-called demolition techniques and the use of American communication equipment. On July 1st, the Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers conducted a "sand table exercise" under the guidance of the "U.S. Military Advisory Group," and on July 8th, they held a "Rhomboid Island" (Dongshan Island is shaped like a rhomboid) landing exercise at the Bade Airport in Taiwan. The head of the "U.S. Military Advisory Group," Chase, and the bandit air force commander Wang Shuming were both present to cheer them on.
    Before dawn on July 16th, the Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers assembled at the Xinzhu Airport in Taiwan and departed. Before boarding the plane, a high-ranking American "military advisor" gave them a "speech." The "military advisor" said triumphantly, "This is the first day of the counterattack against the mainland, and also the first day that the paratroopers will be dispatched and achieve victory. I wish you victory, and we will be waiting at the airport to welcome your triumphant return!..." Thus, the U.S. imperialist-directed Chiang Kai-shek intrusion into Dongshan Island began.
    Of course, U.S. imperialism's wishful thinking was once again wrong. When the Chiang Kai-shek planes carrying these paratroopers secretly sneaked into the airspace over Dongshan Island, the well-prepared People's Liberation Army immediately launched a fierce anti-aircraft fire. The Chiang Kai-shek plane formation was disrupted, and they hurriedly dropped these paratroopers and fled. The Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers, who were already lacking in confidence, became even more panicked after being hit by a burst of fire from the People's Liberation Army. According to captured Chiang Kai-shek paratrooper Second Lieutenant Platoon Leader Zhang Yongchun, "The People's Liberation Army's anti-aircraft firepower was really fierce, making the planes afraid to fly low. Some flew to altitudes of two or three thousand meters and hurriedly dropped the paratroopers. When I jumped, I felt that things were not going well." Qiu Xinlin, the sergeant deputy squad leader of the Second Squad of the Heavy Weapons Company of the First Battalion of the bandit paratroopers, was so flustered that he forgot the basic landing movements and fell to the ground, injuring his upper chest. After our army captured him, they immediately sent him to the hospital for emergency treatment. He said, "When I was parachuting, I knew that things were likely to go badly, but I thought that if I didn't jump, I would be shot if I went back, so I had to close my eyes and jump down." Under the intense and organized firepower of our army, some Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers did not even touch the ground of Dongshan Island and died in mid-air, turning into "aerial corpses" and falling to the ground, while others fell with injuries.
    The Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers who were lucky enough to survive landed in a chaotic manner in the mountainous area around Daoshanghou. Before they could even get their footing, the People's Liberation Army, militiamen, and people of the island immediately launched a strict encirclement and suppression against them.
    The People's Liberation Army moved bravely and quickly, making it impossible for the Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers to assemble and reorganize. The Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers who landed in the mountainous area were scattered in a mess, some blindly firing their guns, and some simply hiding in gullies and rock crevices. Lin Tuqiang, the deputy platoon leader of a certain unit of our army, led a few soldiers to search forward and found two Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers who were firing randomly. Xie, the deputy squad leader, suddenly pounced on them from behind their flank, and Lin Tuqiang rushed up from the front and shouted, "Lay down your guns and you won't be killed!" One Chiang Kai-shek paratrooper hurriedly threw down his gun and surrendered, while the other still wanted to struggle. Lin Tuqiang raised his gun and shouted, "Do you want to die!? Or do you want to live!?" This one Chiang Kai-shek also obediently laid down his weapon.
    At around eleven o'clock, our army divided and surrounded all the Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers, and the militiamen and people on the island also opened a net to search for the Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers. The Fourth Squad of the Fifth Company of a certain unit of our army rushed to the top of a mountain. As soon as they reached the top, a group of Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers also swarmed up. The soldiers of the Fourth Squad threw out a row of grenades, and the Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers rolled and crawled down. The squad leader of the Fourth Squad led the soldiers to track and pursue them. They chased to the foot of the mountain, and suddenly not a single enemy was to be seen. The squad leader of the Fourth Squad suddenly shouted loudly towards the rice fields, "Don't hide, surrender quickly!" Immediately, two Chiang Kai-shek bandits, covered in mud, crawled out of the rice fields, one of them tearing off the Kuomintang party emblem on his hat as he climbed up the ridge. After the Fourth Squad captured two prisoners, they continued to search. They found a strange pile of earth by the side of the road. The soldier Xu Qingsen immediately went up and dug into it. This "pile of earth" suddenly moved, and a Chiang Kai-shek paratrooper, covered in mud from head to toe, crawled out and surrendered.
    In this way, the People's Liberation Army, militiamen, and people on Dongshan Island searched out the Chiang Kai-shek bandits one by one from all the corners. In no more than eight or nine hours, more than two hundred Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers were wiped out in one fell swoop.

    歼灭降落东山岛蒋匪伞兵追记
    七月中旬，英勇的人民解放军和当地人民一道，歼灭了窜犯福建省东山岛的残余蒋匪三千多人，同时还干净、彻底地歼灭了二百多个蒋匪伞兵。
    这批伞兵虽然是微不足道的，但却是蒋匪的“血本”。他们都经过美帝国主义长期的精心训练，从头到脚都是美国装备。他们之中的许多人在抗日战争时就开始受伞兵训练，有的已经是十年以上的
    “老兵”了。这次窜犯东山岛前，蒋匪帮首先在伞兵内部苦心拼凑，然后又把他们集中起来专门训练。据被俘的蒋匪伞兵中尉分队长张永春和少尉分队长张建民说：在蒋匪窜犯东山岛前，美帝国主义在台湾的所谓军事顾问团人员就紧张起来，给蒋匪伞兵“紧急授课”，传授所谓爆破术和美式通讯器材的使用法。七月一日，蒋匪伞兵就在“美国军事顾问团”指导下进行了“沙盘演习”，七月八日又在台湾八德飞机场举行“菱形岛”（东山岛如菱形）降落大演习，演习时“美国军事顾问团”团长蔡斯和匪空军司令王叔铭都在场打气。
    七月十六日天还不亮，蒋匪伞兵在台湾新竹机场集合出发。在上飞机前，一个高级的美国“军事顾问”向他们“训话”，那个“军事顾问”得意忘形地说：“这是反攻大陆的第一天，也是伞兵出动获得胜利的第一天。预祝你们胜利，我们等在机场上欢迎你们胜利归来！……”于是，美帝国主义导演的蒋匪窜扰东山岛的行动开始了。
    当然，美帝国主义的如意算盘又打错了。当蒋匪飞机载着这批伞兵偷偷地窜入东山岛上空时，早有准备的人民解放军立即展开了猛烈的对空射击，蒋匪的飞机队列被打乱了，慌乱地丢下这批伞兵就逃了。蒋匪伞兵本来信心不足，经不住解放军一阵打，就更加慌张了。据被俘的蒋匪伞兵中尉分队长张永春说：“解放军的对空射击火力真猛，打得飞机不敢低飞，有的飞到两三千公尺以上的高空就慌慌张张地把伞兵丢下了。我领跳的时候就觉得事情不妙。”匪伞兵一大队重兵器中队二分队中士副班长邱新林慌得着地时连基本动作都忘记了，一下子就扑跌在地上，上胸受伤。我军俘掳他后，就马上把他送进医院进行紧急治疗。他说：“我在跳伞时就知道凶多吉少，但想到不跳下来回去也是给枪毙，只得闭着眼睛朝下跳了。”在我军炽烈而有组织的火力射击下，有的蒋匪伞兵没有碰到东山岛的一块地皮，就在半空中断了气，变成“空中僵尸”摔到地上，有的带着伤跌落下来。
    侥幸不死的蒋匪伞兵乱七八糟地降落在岛上后林一带山区。他们还没有站住脚，岛上的人民解放军、民兵和人民群众就立即向他们展开了严密的围剿。
    人民解放军动作勇猛迅速，使蒋匪伞兵根本无法集合整队。降落在山区里的蒋匪伞兵乱得东一团西一堆，有的盲目打枪，有的干脆藏到山沟和石缝里去。我军某部副排长林土墙带着几个战士向前搜索，发现有两个蒋匪伞兵正在胡乱地射击。副班长谢?猛地从他们侧后扑去，林土墙从正面冲上去，大喝一声：“缴枪不杀！”一个蒋匪伞兵慌忙丢枪投降，另一个还想挣扎，林土墙举起枪喝道：“你想死！？想活！？”这一个蒋匪也就乖乖地放下武器了。
    十一时左右，我军分割包围了所有的蒋匪伞兵，岛上的民兵和人民也张开了搜捕蒋匪伞兵的天罗地网。我军某部五连四班赶上一座山头，刚到上面，一群蒋匪伞兵也拥了上来。四班战士扔出一排手榴弹，蒋匪就连滚带爬地逃下去了。四班长带领战士跟踪追击，追到山脚下，忽然一个敌人也不见了。四班长突然向着稻田大声喊道：“不要躲了，赶快缴枪！”马上两个蒋匪拖着浑身泥浆从稻田里爬了出来，其中一个一面爬上田梗，一面还在撕着帽子上国民党党徽。四班抓了两个俘虏后，又继续进行搜索。他们发现在路旁又有一个奇怪的土堆。战士许庆森立即上去扒了一下。这个“土堆”忽然动起来，一个从头到脚都涂满了泥土的蒋匪伞兵爬起来投降了。
    就这样，东山岛上的人民解放军、民兵和人民从所有的角落里，把蒋匪一个个搜出来。前后不过八九个钟头，两百多个蒋匪伞兵就被一网打尽了。
