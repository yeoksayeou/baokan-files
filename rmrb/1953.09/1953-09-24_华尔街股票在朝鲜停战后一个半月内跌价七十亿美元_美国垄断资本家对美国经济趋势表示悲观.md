Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd, New York dispatch: Pessimism in American business circles regarding the US economic trend is reflected in the Wall Street stock market.

According to Wall Street stock market experts, from the beginning of this year to mid-September, the prices of stocks and bonds have fallen by a total of 13 billion US dollars, wiping out a quarter of the total value that had risen due to the temporary war boom of the past four years. According to the Associated Press, although the decline in stock prices began at the beginning of the year, it has become increasingly intense in recent weeks. Hundreds of stocks have fallen to unprecedented levels this year, and some individual stocks have even fallen to their lowest levels in two or three years. Wall Street experts estimate that in the one and a half months or so from the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement to mid-September, stock prices fell by as much as seven billion US dollars.

An Associated Press dispatch said: "If you ask what's wrong with the stock market, stock market brokers and observers will not hesitate to answer: everyone is worried about the prospects for buying and selling... If you ask why everyone is suddenly selling off? Some brokers will say: you can look at the recent industrial news to get the answer."

Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd, Washington dispatch: A report released by the US Department of Agriculture on the 20th stated that in the year ending July 1st of this year, US agricultural exports fell by 31% compared to the previous year, reaching the lowest record since the end of World War II. Among the three most important US agricultural exports, cotton exports decreased by 52% compared to the previous year, wheat and flour decreased by 36%, and tobacco decreased by 12%. Exports of other products such as dairy products, soybeans, and potatoes were also "severely affected by reduced foreign demand." The Department of Agriculture's report also stated that in the year ending July 1st, the total value of US industrial and agricultural exports decreased by 3%. Agricultural exports accounted for 19% of the total value, compared to 26% in the previous year.

Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: The September 14th issue of the American "Time" magazine quoted the US Department of Agriculture as saying that the American wool industry is in a "very depressed state." The annual domestic wool consumption in the United States has decreased from 738 million pounds in 1946 to 472 million pounds, a decrease of more than one-third. According to "Time" magazine, due to the shrinking sales of wool, "surplus" wool is constantly increasing. In order to protect the interests of wool industry capitalists, the US government has used taxes paid by the American people to purchase almost 40% of the so-called "surplus" wool from the total output of 1952, but this year it must purchase another 40 million pounds of wool that cannot be sold at all in the market.

    华尔街股票在朝鲜停战后一个半月内跌价七十亿美元
    美国垄断资本家对美国经济趋势表示悲观
    【新华社二十三日讯】纽约消息：美国企业界对美国经济趋向的悲观，在华尔街的股票市场上得到了反映。
    据华尔街股票市场的专家估计，从今年年初到九月中旬，股票与债券的价格一共下跌了一百三十亿美元，即去掉了已往四年中因为暂时的战争景气上涨的总价值的四分之一。据美联社说，股票价格下跌虽然在年初就开始，但却在最近几个星期内变得愈来愈激烈。几百种股票跌至本年来前所未有的水平，一些个别的股票甚至跌至两三年来的最低纪录。据华尔街专家估计，在朝鲜停战协定签字后到九月中旬为止的一个半月多一点时间里，股票价格就跌落了七十亿美元之巨。
    美联社的一则消息说：“如果你要问股票市场犯了什么毛病，那么股票市场的经纪人和观察家就会毫不迟疑地回答你说：大家都在为买卖的前景伤脑筋……如果你要问，为什么大家突然抛售？有些经纪人就会说：你可以看看最近的工业新闻，便可以获得答案。”
    【新华社二十三日讯】华盛顿消息：美国农业部二十日发表的报告说，在截至今年七月一日为止的一年内，美国农产品出口比上一年下降了百分之三十一，达到了第二次世界大战结束以来的最低纪录。在美国三种最重要的农产品的输出中，棉花的输出比上一年减少了百分之五十二，小麦与面粉减少了百分之三十六，烟草减少了百分之十二。其他如乳制品，大豆与马铃薯等的出口也受到“国外需求减少的严重影响”。农业部的报告还说，在截至七月一日为止的这一年内，美国全部工农业出口总值降低了百分之三。农产品出口在总值中占百分之十九，上一年是百分之二十六。
    【新华社二十二日讯】九月十四日的美国“时代”周刊引美国农业部的话说，美国羊毛业正处于“很萧条的状态”。美国国内每年的羊毛消费量已从一九四六年的七亿三千八百万磅下降至四亿七千二百万磅，即减少了三分之一以上。据“时代”周刊说，由于羊毛销路的萎缩，“过剩”的羊毛正在不断增加。美国政府为了维护羊毛业资本家的利益，已经用美国人民交纳的税款收购了差不多占一九五二年总产量百分之四十的所谓“过剩”羊毛，但在今年内还必须再收购另外四千万磅在市场中完全卖不出去的羊毛。
