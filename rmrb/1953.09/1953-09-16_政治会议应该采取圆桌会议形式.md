The United States exerted significant pressure to force the 430th session of the United Nations General Assembly to pass the so-called "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" on the composition of the Korean political conference, which was concocted by the United States. This unreasonable resolution completely violates the path that a political conference should follow and the interests of peace and security for all nations, and has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among just public opinion in various countries.

Regarding the composition of the Korean political conference, China and North Korea have clearly advocated that it should take the form of a round table conference, that is, a form in which the two sides of the Korean armistice jointly consult with the participation of other relevant countries, rather than a form in which the two sides of the Korean armistice negotiate separately. Vyshinsky, the head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, believed that the political conference should be in the form of a round table conference when discussing this issue at the Seventh UN General Assembly, and put forward a reasonable proposal regarding the members of the political conference. China and North Korea have expressed their support for the Soviet proposal.

The reason why the political conference must take the form of a round table conference is very obvious.

The Korean War has extremely complicated the situation in the Far East and Asia. Therefore, the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is an extremely important factor in restoring normal relations between countries in the Far East and Asia and consolidating world peace and security. All countries in the world, especially the Soviet Union and other Asian countries, are concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Now that the Korean armistice has been achieved, and the Korean issue is about to enter the stage of political consultation, it is very necessary for countries related to the Korean issue, especially the Soviet Union and other Asian countries, to directly participate in the consultation, which is very beneficial to the smooth resolution of the Korean issue.

Multilateral consultations at a round table conference can eliminate the atmosphere of hostility and create a harmonious atmosphere, which is a necessary condition for seeking the success of peaceful consultations. Especially at this critical stage when the international tension has eased somewhat due to the Korean armistice, the smooth holding of the Korean political conference in a harmonious atmosphere will undoubtedly greatly help the peaceful atmosphere of the entire world.

Therefore, public opinion in various countries and governments that are willing to see the international situation continue to ease also hope that the political conference will take the form of a round table conference, because this will set a precedent for resolving other international disputes through peaceful consultations.

However, the United States, for its ulterior motives, refused to consider the reasonable proposals of China and North Korea, and regardless of the Soviet Union's insistence on a just attitude and the common aspirations of the majority of countries in the world, unilaterally and unreasonably wanted to limit the political conference to a meeting between the two sides of the Korean armistice. To this end, the United States forced other countries that sent troops to invade Korea to put forward the so-called "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" at the United Nations General Assembly, and manipulated its "majority" in the United Nations to pass this proposal. At the same time, the United States carried out despicable behind-the-scenes activities, vetoed the Soviet proposal on the members of the political conference at the United Nations General Assembly, and did everything possible to oppose India's participation in the political conference.

This approach of the United States is unreasonable.

Extreme reactionaries in the United States, such as Dulles and Lodge, attempted to create a basis for their unreasonable demands by distorting the clauses of the Korean Armistice Agreement by despicable means. They clung to the concept of the word "both parties" in Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement, insisting that only the countries of the two sides of the armistice could participate in the political conference. However, the wording of Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement is very clear. It neither stipulates that the representatives participating in the political conference are limited to the countries that actually participated in the war, nor does it contain any words that can be interpreted as only countries that participated in the war can be nominated by both parties as members of the political conference. Associated Press news analyst Roberts reported on August 15 that "the armistice agreement stipulates that 'relevant countries' attend the meeting (referring to the political conference)," but "the United States hopes that the (United Nations) General Assembly will interpret this term as countries that actually participated in the war." It can be seen that Dulles and his ilk cannot find the basis they need in the original text of the armistice agreement.

If we follow the American distortion, the political conference will actually be another Panmunjom meeting. But people know that the Panmunjom meeting was a negotiation between the belligerent parties to seek to stop the war, and it cannot be applied to a meeting to discuss a peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue. The former is a purely military negotiation, which can only be attended by the belligerent parties and bound by its decisions; the latter is a peaceful political consultation, whose task is to first negotiate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and then discuss other issues, and the completion of this task is closely related to the interests of peace and security in the Far East and the world. Therefore, it cannot be resolved and guaranteed only by the two sides of the armistice in Korea. It is precisely for this reason that the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that a higher-level political conference should be held, and it cannot be a continuation of the Panmunjom negotiations.

The majority of countries in the United Nations, including many of the United States' allies, do not agree with the United States' unreasonable restrictions on the members of the political conference. This is particularly manifested in the fact that the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other countries participating in the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" put forward two other proposals at the United Nations General Assembly that contradicted the nature of the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal," advocating inviting the neutral countries of the Soviet Union and India, which were not parties to the armistice, to participate in the political conference. These two proposals received widespread support within the United Nations. The proposal to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the political conference was approved by an absolute majority of fifty-six countries; the proposal to invite India to participate also received a majority vote when voted in the Political Committee. These facts show that the Seventh United Nations General Assembly has already recognized the necessity for the political conference to invite neutral countries that were not parties to the armistice to participate. It can be seen from this that the so-called "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" cannot represent the wishes of many participating countries, let alone the wishes of the majority of member states of the United Nations, and is contrary to the spirit of the United Nations Charter. It is the result of the United States' tyrannical pressure imposed on these countries.

The excuses used by the United States to openly and arbitrarily exclude India and other Asian countries, which have made important contributions to the Korean armistice and the POW issue, from participating in the political conference are untenable. Dulles said in a speech on September 2, without any concealment, that the reason why India could not participate in the political conference was the "price" it deserved for not participating in the war on the American side. What conclusions can people draw from such shameful words and deeds? Obviously, the United States is also using the right to participate in the political conference as a means for it to carry out international blackmail and attack other countries' peaceful intentions. At the same time, the United States once again used the shameless clamor of the Syngman Rhee group to suppress the reasonable wishes of the majority of member states of the United Nations. To this end, the United States illegally introduced the Foreign Minister of the Syngman Rhee group, Byun Young-tae, into the United Nations conference room to insult India and oppose India's participation in the political conference. Thus, this became the shield for Lodge and his ilk to resist India. Lodge repeatedly said at the United Nations General Assembly: "Given the attitude of South Korea that everyone knows, I believe that India's participation will undermine the success of the meeting." But who doesn't know that Syngman Rhee is a running dog of the United States; if it were not for the connivance and acquiescence of the United States, Syngman Rhee would not be able to be so rampant. Even the American newspapers admitted that the Syngman Rhee group's clamor against India was an "understanding" between Dulles and Syngman Rhee. But Dulles actually said that he "very much respects India," which is of course nonsense.

Why is the United States so arrogant and unreasonable on the issue of the composition of the political conference, and does not hesitate to use all means to turn the political conference into a negotiation between the two sides of the armistice?

The matter is very clear that a negotiation between the two sides of the armistice will facilitate the United States to adopt an arbitrary policy towards its so-called "one side." The American "New York Post" reporter Lash revealed this shameful intention of the United States in a recent report. He wrote: "Reliable diplomatic sources said that the United States not only hopes to exclude India from the political conference, but even attempts to use a method to prevent Britain, France and other countries that supply troops to the Unified Command from having a real say at this meeting."

The United States has always used the international tension and hostility it has created to promote its policy of harming the interests of other countries. Now, it still wants to do so.

The historical lessons of the Panmunjom negotiations are not unfamiliar to people. In that negotiation between the two sides, the American negotiators, for the most selfish interests of the American reactionary forces, adopted an arrogant and unreasonable attitude, rejecting consultation, and repeatedly declared that their demands were "final and unchangeable," which caused the negotiations to fall into a deadlock several times and be on the verge of collapse; in that negotiation between the two belligerent parties, the American negotiators, ignoring the condemnation of world opinion, constantly took unilateral actions, practiced truancy, and announced indefinite adjournments. The reason why this historical lesson is particularly useful today is that people can see from it that if the political conference also becomes a negotiation between the two sides, the United States can repeat its delaying and sabotaging tricks.

Things are exactly like this. After the Korean armistice was realized, the American reactionary forces carried out a series of activities to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Dulles not only signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with Syngman Rhee, attempting to keep American troops stationed in South Korea indefinitely, but also made early plans for the political conference, planning to withdraw from the political conference after ninety days. After the United Nations General Assembly passed the so-called "Fifteen-Nation Proposal," Dulles became even more arrogant and domineering. In a speech on September 2, he openly threatened: "When negotiating with the Communists, we must always remember an end point." This very clearly shows that the reason why the United States wants to limit the political conference to a negotiation between the two sides of the armistice is precisely to prepare conditions for it to realize its plan with the Syngman Rhee group to sabotage the political conference, so as to facilitate it to continue to maintain tension in the Far East and promote its war policy.

Obviously, all peace-loving people should never tolerate this kind of thing. The unreasonable resolution of the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" on the political conference forced by the United Nations by the United States cannot be fully agreed upon; it is completely contrary to the purpose of the political conference to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The political conference should take the form of a round table conference, not a Panmunjom-style hostile armistice negotiation between the two sides. In order to reasonably resolve the issue of the members of the political conference, my Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai re-submitted reasonable proposals in his reply to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on September 13, and requested that they be included in the agenda of the Eighth UN General Assembly. The Eighth UN General Assembly should continue to discuss the issue of expanding the members of the political conference; all peace-loving countries should strive for the smooth convening of the political conference in the form of a round table conference, and resolutely defeat the American conspiracy to sabotage the political conference.

    政治会议应该采取圆桌会议形式
    高集
    美国施用了重大的压力，强迫联合国大会第四三○次会议通过了美国包办提出的关于朝鲜政治会议组成问题的所谓“十五国提案”。这个不合理的决议完全违反了政治会议所应遵循的道路与各国和平与安全的利益，已引起了各国公正舆论的普遍不满。
    对于朝鲜政治会议的组成形式，中朝两国曾明确主张应采取圆桌会议形式，即朝鲜停战双方在其他有关国家参加之下共同协商的形式，而不采取朝鲜停战双方单独谈判的形式。苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长维辛斯基在七届联大讨论这个问题时认为政治会议应是圆桌会议形式，并提出了关于政治会议成员的合理提案。苏联的提案，中朝两国都曾表示支持。
    政治会议必须采取圆桌会议的形式的道理是十分明显的。
    朝鲜战争曾使远东及亚洲的局势极端复杂化，因而朝鲜问题的和平解决，对于恢复远东及亚洲各国的正常关系，巩固世界和平与安全都是极其重要的因素。世界各国，首先是苏联与亚洲其它国家都关心朝鲜问题的和平解决。现在，朝鲜停战已经实现，朝鲜问题将要进入政治协商的阶段，与朝鲜问题有关的国家，特别是苏联和其它亚洲国家直接参加协商是十分必要的，这对朝鲜问题的顺利解决是非常有益的。
    圆桌会议的多方面的协商，可以消除敌对气氛，并造成和谐的空气，这是求得和平协商成功的必要条件。特别在由于朝鲜停战而使国际紧张局势有了一些和缓的这个紧要阶段，朝鲜政治会议在和谐的情况下顺利举行，无疑将大大有助于整个世界的和平气氛。
    因此，各国公众舆论及愿意看到国际局势继续和缓下去的各国政府，也都希望政治会议采取圆桌会议的形式，因为这将为以和平协商方式解决其他国际争端建立典范。
    但是，美国却为了它不可告人的目的，拒不考虑中朝两国的合理主张，并不顾苏联坚持正义的态度以及世界多数国家的共同愿望，而片面无理地要把政治会议限制为朝鲜停战双方的会议。为此，美国迫使出兵侵朝的其他国家在联合国大会上提出了所谓“十五国提案”，并操纵它在联合国中的“多数”通过了这个提案。同时，美国进行了卑劣的幕后活动，在联合国大会上否决了苏联关于政治会议成员的提案，并竭尽一切力量反对印度参加政治会议。
    美国的这种做法是毫无道理的。
    美国的极端反动分子杜勒斯、洛奇之流，企图以曲解朝鲜停战协定条文的卑劣手段，为他们的无理主张制造根据。他们死咬住停战协定第六十款中“双方”一词的概念，硬说政治会议只能由停战双方的国家参加。但是，朝鲜停战协定第六十款的条文写得很明白，它既没有规定参加政治会议的代表只限于实际参加战争的国家，也没有任何词句可以解释为只有参加战争的国家才能被双方提名为政治会议的成员。美联社新闻分析员罗伯茨在八月十五日的报道中说：“停战协定规定由‘有关国家’出席会议（指政治会议）”，然而“美国希望（联合国）大会解释这个词为实际参加战争的国家。”可见，杜勒斯之流在停战协定的原文中是找不到他们所需要的根据的。
    如果按照美国的曲解，政治会议实际上将是另一个板门店会议。但是人们知道，板门店会议是交战双方谋求停止战争的谈判，它不能适用于讨论和平解决整个朝鲜问题的会议。前者为纯军事性质的谈判，只能由交战双方参加并接受它的决定的约束；后者是和平的政治协商，它的任务是先行协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题，然后再讨论其他问题，而这一任务的完成又密切关系到远东及世界各国和平与安全的利益，因此它不可能仅由在朝鲜的停战双方加以解决和保证。正是因为这个缘故，朝鲜停战协定才规定要举行高一级的政治会议，而不能是板门店谈判的继续。
    联合国中的大多数国家，包括美国的许多盟国，都不同意美国对政治会议成员的无理限制。这特别表现在参加“十五国提案”的英国、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰等国在联合国大会上提出了与“十五国提案”性质相矛盾的其他两个提案，主张邀请停战双方以外的中立国家的苏联和印度参加政治会议。这两个提案在联合国内获得广泛的支持。邀请苏联参加政治会议的提案得到五十六国的绝对多数的赞成而获得通过；邀请印度参加的提案在政治委员会中表决时也得到了多数票。这些事实说明，第七届联合国大会已经承认了政治会议有邀请停战双方以外的中立国家参加的必要。由此可见，所谓“十五国提案”并不能代表许多参加提案国家的意愿，更不能代表联合国大多数会员国的意愿，并且是与联合国宪章精神相违背的，它是美国的横暴的压力强加给这些国家的结果。
    美国公然专横地排斥对朝鲜停战与战俘问题作了重要贡献的国家印度以及其它亚洲国家参加政治会议的藉口，都是站不住脚的。杜勒斯在九月二日发表的演说中丝毫不加掩饰地说，印度不能参加政治会议是它没有参加美国一方作战所应得的“代价”。人们从这种可耻的言行中能得到什么结论呢？显而易见，美国把参加政治会议的权利也作为它实行国际讹诈、打击别国和平意愿的手段了。同时，美国又一次利用李承晚集团的无耻叫嚷来压制联合国多数会员国家的合理愿望。为此，美国把李承晚集团的外务部长官卞荣泰非法地引进联合国会议室，对印度横施辱骂，反对印度参加政治会议。于是，这就成为洛奇之流抵制印度的盾牌了。洛奇在联合国大会上一再说：“鉴于大家知道的韩国的态度，我相信印度的参加会破坏会议的成功。”但是，谁不知道李承晚是美国的走狗；如果不是美国的纵容和默许，李承晚是不可能这样嚣张跋扈的。甚至，美国的报刊也承认，李承晚集团反对印度的叫嚣是杜勒斯与李承晚之间的“谅解”。但是杜勒斯居然还说他是“非常尊重印度的”，这当然是鬼话。
    美国在政治会议的组成问题上这样蛮横无理，不惜使用一切手段，要把政治会议变为一个停战双方的谈判，究竟是为了什么呢？
    事情很显然，一个停战双方的谈判将便于美国对它的所谓“一方”采取独断专行的政策。美国“纽约邮报”记者拉希在最近的报道中透露了美国的这种可耻的用心，他写道：“可靠的外交界人士说，美国不仅希望把印度排斥在政治会议之外，甚至还试图运用一种办法，使英、法和其他供应军队给统一司令部的各国在这次会议上没有真正的发言权。”
    美国从来就是利用它自己所制造的国际紧张敌对气氛，来推行它损害其他国家利益的政策。现在，它还要这样做。
    板门店谈判的历史教训，对于人们并不是生疏的。在那个双方的谈判中，美国谈判代表为了美国反动势力的最自私的利益，曾采取了蛮横无理、拒绝协商的态度，一再宣称他们的主张是“最后的、不可改变的”，而使谈判几度陷入僵局而濒于破裂；在那个作战双方的谈判中，美国谈判代表曾不顾世界舆论的谴责，不断采取片面行动，实行逃会和宣布无限期休会。这个历史教训在今天所以特别有益，就在于人们由此可以看到，如果政治会议也变成一个双方的谈判的话，美国就可以重施其拖延和破坏的伎俩了。
    事情也正是这样。在朝鲜停战实现后，美国反动势力就进行了一系列的活动，以阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。杜勒斯不但与李承晚签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，企图把美国军队无限期地留驻在南朝鲜，并且对政治会议也早作了预谋，要在九十天后退出政治会议。在联合国大会通过所谓“十五国提案”之后，杜勒斯就表现得更为骄横嚣张了。他在九月二日发表的演说中公然威胁说：“在和共方进行谈判的时候，我们必须经常记住一个终点。”这就极其清楚地说明了，美国要把政治会议限制为停战双方的谈判，正是为了要实现它与李承晚集团破坏政治会议的计划而准备条件，以便利它在远东继续保持紧张局势，推行它的战争政策。
    显然，一切关心和平的人们都绝不应容忍这种事情。美国强迫联合国通过的关于政治会议的“十五国提案”这个不合理决议，是不能使人完全同意的；它与政治会议谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的宗旨是完全背道而驰的。政治会议应该采取圆桌会议的形式，而不是板门店式的敌对停战双方谈判。为了合理解决政治会议的成员问题，我周恩来外长在九月十三日答复联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的复文中，重新提出了合理建议，并要求列入第八届联合国大会议程。联合国第八届大会应该继续讨论扩大政治会议成员问题；一切愿望和平的国家都应该为政治会议以圆桌会议的形式的顺利召开而努力，并坚决击败美国破坏政治会议的阴谋计划。
