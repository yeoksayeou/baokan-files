    U.S. Interference in Iran's Internal Affairs
    Feng Zhidan
    The recent events in Iran—August 15th and August 19th—make it even clearer to people how brazen and shameless the conspiracies of the U.S. aggressive bloc to wantonly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries have developed!
    There is solid evidence that the overthrow of the Mossadegh government and the rise of Zahedi were acts perpetrated by the United States. As early as September 1952, British Ambassador to Washington Franks revealed in his report on informal talks between former Iranian Minister of War Bina and U.S. representatives that the United States clearly intended to use in Iran the same methods used by Colonel Shishekly in Syria and General Naguib in Egypt. The report mentioned that former Iranian Minister of War Bina had formed a political group composed of former Iranian army officers, including Major General Zahedi, who had collaborated with German fascists during World War II. This group also received substantial funds from U.S. institutions. This view was confirmed by a statement issued by the National Association for Anti-Imperialist Struggle in Iran in April of this year. The statement pointed out that for some time, under the instigation of former Privy Counselor Hossein Ala, retired General Zahedi, and Zhagzai, and under the direct leadership of the Iranian King and U.S. Ambassador Henderson, a coup had been brewing. The U.S., British, and French foreign ministers' meeting held in Washington not long ago dared to predict with certainty that "the Mossadegh government in Iran will collapse before the end of this year" and that Mossadegh would be "driven out of power by force," which more powerfully proves that the Iranian incident was instigated by the United States.
    On the eve of the first coup on August 15th, U.S. "police expert" Schwartzkopf, a former U.S. advisor to the Iranian Gendarmerie, suddenly "traveled" to Tehran and held a secret meeting with the Iranian King. On August 4th, the Tehran "Today East" newspaper pointed out: "There is no doubt that Schwartzkopf's arrival in Iran must have a definite plan and task." After the failure of the first coup on August 15th, the U.S. aggressive bloc was greatly alarmed, and U.S. Ambassador to Iran Henderson rushed back to Tehran from Iraq, publicly warning Mossadegh that the United States no longer recognized his administration and demanded that he resign immediately. Immediately afterward, the second coup broke out on August 19th.
    The purpose of U.S. imperialism in staging a coup in Iran is to seize Iran's "huge oil wealth," squeeze out British influence, further enslave the Iranian people, and make Iran a U.S. colony and military base.
    For half a century, Iran's oil resources have been occupied by the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Seeing billions of dollars of wealth fall into the pockets of British monopoly capitalists, the Iranian people have long been determined to reclaim their oil sovereignty. After World War II, the United States coveted Iranian oil, actively intervened in the Persian Gulf, and expanded its aggressive forces in Iran. The United States attempted to use the Iranian people's sentiment for reclaiming oil sovereignty to expel British forces from Iran and gain control of Iranian oil. Therefore, it instigated special agents to assassinate Razmara, the pro-British former prime minister who opposed the nationalization of oil, and supported Mossadegh, who advocated the nationalization of oil, to the position of prime minister. However, shortly after the establishment of the Mossadegh regime, the United States discovered that although this government accepted the U.S. military advisory group, accepted the massive influx of U.S. capital disguised as the "Point Four Program," and permitted the United States to build naval and air bases along the Persian Gulf and in northern Iran, it could not completely obey the United States on the oil issue. After the Mossadegh government nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, it was renamed "National Iranian Oil Company," and at the same time, it rejected the U.S. proposal to use the "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development" to monopolize Iranian oil. The Mossadegh government rejected six proposals from the United States and Britain regarding "resolving" the oil issue, including the so-called joint proposal put forward by Truman and Churchill. The United States successively attempted to buy out Iran's oil sovereignty with loans of ten million to one hundred million dollars, but without success. At the same time, the United States, under the pretext of "mediating" the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute, exhausted all means of coercion and inducement toward Iran, but still failed. Eisenhower wrote to Mossadegh on June 29th of this year, threatening Mossadegh to quickly comply with the cessation of "U.S. aid." When coercion failed, U.S. interventionists embarked on the adventurer's path of using their agents to overthrow the Mossadegh government by force.
    The U.S. activities in Iran to seize oil hegemony have further deepened the contradictions between the United States and Britain in Iran and the Near and Middle East. Before and during the war, U.S. oil monopolies squeezed out British forces in Kuwait, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and other places, replacing Britain's position and becoming a powerful competitor to Britain, which monopolized Middle East oil. After the war, the United States directly intervened to seize Britain's oil interests in Iran. Iranian oil production accounts for three-quarters of British oil production and is the largest oil resource controlled by Britain in the Near East. British bourgeois newspapers have continuously attacked the U.S. policy of seizing Iranian oil by trickery and force. After the Zahedi coup, the "New York Herald Tribune" published a message on the front page with the headline "Washington is Pleased with the Iranian Incident"; while London was in an atmosphere of sadness mixed with "happiness." According to a Reuters dispatch from London, London diplomats said that the first thing the Zahedi government would do was to restore Iran's oil trade, but he expected that Zahedi would not ask Britain to help do so. As expected, after Zahedi came to power, he sought "substantial assistance" from the United States; U.S. Ambassador to Iran Henderson has begun talks with Zahedi on "U.S. aid."
    Of course, the U.S. interference in Iran is also inseparable from the U.S. conspiracy to organize aggressive blocs in the Near and Middle East and actively prepare for a new war. The United States has built many naval and air bases along the Persian Gulf and in northwestern Iran. In 1947 and 1950, the United States and Iran signed military agreements that allowed a large number of U.S. military advisors to control the Iranian army. In October 1951, the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey suggested that Arab countries participate in the so-called "Middle East Command." However, this sinister imperialist proposal was immediately met with widespread and strong opposition from the people of the Near and Middle East countries. Arab countries unanimously refused to participate in the Middle East aggressive bloc. Therefore, the U.S. aggressive bloc intensified its brutal interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries.
    However, the U.S. aggressive bloc's blatant interference in Iran's internal affairs and its plunder of Iran's oil wealth have been, are, and will continue to arouse the most resolute opposition from the Iranian people and peace-loving people all over the world. In the postwar years, the Iranian people have been waging a heroic struggle for national independence and oil nationalization. In February 1951, the Iranian People's Party put forward the call for oil nationalization, which was supported by all the Iranian people. In recent years, Iranian workers and students have launched huge waves of strikes and demonstrations. The Iranian people established the National Association for Anti-Imperialist Struggle in Iran, further uniting Iran's patriotic forces to carry out a powerful struggle for national independence. After Zahedi came to power, he immediately followed the intentions of his U.S. masters to arrest patriotic progressives and peace-loving democrats in the country; and adopted a series of fascist measures. However, the Iranian People's Party called on the Iranian people to rise up in a new struggle, resolutely oppose foreign interference, and strive for national independence.
    The Iranian people's struggle has had a significant impact on the people of the Middle East and Near East. The Egyptian people are fighting for the sovereignty of the Suez Canal area. The people of the Middle East and Near East are uniting in a common destiny to oppose the interference and enslavement of the U.S. aggressive bloc. On August 27th, the Preparatory Committee of the Middle East, Near East, and North Africa People's Congress wrote in its proclamation to the people: "Common dangers force us to unite and seek ways and means to save our countries from the dangers that threaten us." The U.S. imperialist policy of brutal interference in the internal affairs of Iran and other countries, under the strength of the Iranian and Middle East and Near East peoples uniting to struggle, will eventually come to a shameful and complete bankruptcy.

    美国对伊朗内政的干涉
    冯之丹
    最近——八月十五日及八月十九日——在伊朗发生的事变，使人们更清楚地认识了美国侵略集团肆意干涉他国内政的阴谋活动，已经发展到了何等蛮横无耻的地步！
    伊朗摩萨台政府的被推翻和萨希迪的上台，有确凿的证据证明是美国干的勾当。远在一九五二年九月，英国驻华盛顿大使佛朗克斯在其关于前伊朗陆军大臣比纳和美国代表进行非正式会谈的报告中就曾透露说，美国显然要在伊朗使用像施舍克里上校在叙利亚和纳吉布将军在埃及使用过的手段。报告中提到前伊朗陆军大臣比纳已把前伊朗陆军军官组成一个政治集团，其中包括了第二次世界大战时和德国法西斯相勾结的萨希迪少将。这个集团还从美国机构得到相当多的款项。今年四月间，伊朗全国反帝国主义斗争协会发表的一项声明中证实了这种看法。这个声明指出：若干时候以来，在前枢密大臣候赛尼·阿拉以及退休将军萨希迪和兹哈齐的煽动下，在伊朗国王和美国大使汉德逊的直接领导下，一个政变一直在酝酿着。不久以前在华盛顿召开的美、英、法三国外长会议，敢于确定地预告“伊朗摩萨台政府将在今年年底以前垮台”，摩萨台会“被武力赶下台去”，更有力地证明了伊朗事件是美国策动的。
    八月十五日第一次政变前夕，美国的“警察专家”、前伊朗宪兵总署的美国顾问施瓦茨科夫突然到德黑兰“旅行”，和伊朗国王作了秘密的会见。八月四日德黑兰“今日东方报”指出：“毫无疑义，施瓦茨科夫来到伊朗必然有着他确定的计划和任务。”八月十五日第一次政变失败后，美国侵略集团大为恐慌，美驻伊朗大使汉德逊从伊拉克匆匆赶返德黑兰，公开出面警告摩萨台说，美国已不再承认他的执政，并要他立即辞职。紧接着，八月十九日爆发了第二次政变。
    美帝国主义在伊朗制造政变的目的，是企图夺取伊朗“巨大的石油财富”，排挤英国势力，进一步奴役伊朗人民，使伊朗成为美国的殖民地和军事基地。
    半世纪以来，伊朗石油富源就被英国的英伊石油公司所占有。伊朗人民眼看着五、六十亿美元的巨额财富落入了英国垄断资本家的荷包，老早就坚决要把石油主权收回来。第二次世界大战以后，美国垂涎伊朗石油，积极插足波斯湾，扩张它在伊朗的侵略势力。美国企图利用伊朗人民收回石油主权的情绪，把英国势力从伊朗驱逐出去，取得伊朗石油的控制权。于是唆使特务分子暗杀了反对石油国有化的亲英国的前任首相拉兹马拉，而把主张石油国有化的摩萨台扶上首相的位置。可是摩萨台政权成立后不久，美国便发现这个政府虽然接受了美国的军事顾问团，接受了以“第四点计划”为糖衣的美国巨额资本侵入，许可了美国在波斯湾沿岸及伊朗北部建筑海军和空军基地；而在石油问题上，却不能百依百顺听命于美国。摩萨台政府把英伊石油公司收归国有后，改成了“国有伊朗石油公司”，同时拒绝了美国利用“国际复兴开发银行”进行独占伊朗石油的提议。摩萨台政府拒绝了美、英关于“解决”石油问题的六次建议，其中包括了杜鲁门和邱吉尔共同提出的所谓联合建议。美国先后企图用一千万至一亿美元的贷款，收买伊朗的石油主权，都没有得到成功。美国同时以“调解”英伊石油纠纷为名，对伊朗竭尽了胁迫利诱的能事，仍然不免于失败。艾森豪威尔在今年六月二十九日致函摩萨台，以停止“美援”胁迫摩萨台迅速就范。胁迫不成，美国干涉者便走上通过其代理人之手用暴力推翻摩萨台政府的冒险家的道路。
    美国在伊朗争夺石油霸权的活动，进一步加深了美、英在伊朗和中近东的矛盾。战前和战争期间，美国的石油垄断企业即在科威特、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯等地排挤英国势力，取代了英国的地位，成为独占中近东石油的英国的有力竞争者。战后美国更直接插手夺取英国在伊朗的石油利益。伊朗石油生产占英国石油产量的四分之三，是英国在近东所掌握的最大的石油资源。英国资产阶级报纸曾不断攻击美国对伊朗石油的巧取豪夺政策。萨希迪政变后，“纽约先驱论坛报”在第一版以“华盛顿为伊朗事变而高兴”为标题刊登消息；而伦敦则在“高兴”中夹杂着悲哀的气氛。据路透社伦敦消息，伦敦的外交人士说，萨希迪政府首先将要恢复伊朗的石油贸易，但他预料萨希迪不会请英国帮助这样做。果然，萨希迪上台之后，就向美国求取“大量援助”；美国驻伊朗大使汉德逊已开始和萨希迪进行有关“美援”的会谈了。
    当然，美帝国主义在伊朗的干涉行为，还与美国在近、中东组织侵略集团，积极准备新战争的阴谋也是分不开的。美国在波斯湾沿岸和伊朗西北部建筑了许多海军和空军基地。一九四七年和一九五○年美、伊签订了军事性的协定，使大量的美国军事顾问控制了伊朗的军队。一九五一年十月，美、英、法、土四国建议阿拉伯国家参加所谓“中东司令部”。可是，这一阴险的帝国主义的建议，立即受到中近东国家的人民的普遍而强烈的反对。阿拉伯国家一致拒绝参加中东侵略集团。因此美国侵略集团就加紧了对阿拉伯国家内政的强暴的干涉。
    但是，美国侵略集团对伊朗内政的粗暴干涉及对伊朗石油财富的掠夺，过去曾经、现在仍然要引起伊朗人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的最坚决的反对。战后年代中，伊朗人民一直为争取民族独立和石油国有化而进行了英勇的斗争。一九五一年二月，伊朗人民党提出石油国有化的号召，得到了全伊朗人民的拥护。近年以来伊朗的工人和学生曾经掀起了巨大的罢工和示威浪潮。伊朗人民成立了伊朗全国反帝国主义斗争协会，进一步团结了伊朗的爱国力量，进行争取民族独立的强大斗争。萨希迪上台后，立即遵照美国主子的意图在国内大肆逮捕爱国进步分子及和平民主人士；采取了一系列的法西斯措施。但是伊朗人民党号召伊朗人民起来进行新的斗争，坚决反对外国干涉，争取民族独立。
    伊朗人民的斗争曾经给予中东、近东人民以重大的影响。埃及人民正在为争取苏彝士运河区的主权而斗争。中东、近东人民在共同的命运中正在联合起来，反对美国侵略集团的干涉和奴役。八月二十七日，中东、近东及北非人民大会筹备委员会在它的告人民书中写道：“共同的危险迫使我们要联合在一起，寻求将我们的国家从威胁着我们的危险中拯救出来的方法和道路。”美帝国主义对伊朗及其他国家内政的粗暴干涉政策，在伊朗及中东、近东人民团结起来进行斗争的力量之下，最后必将归于可耻的彻底的破产。
