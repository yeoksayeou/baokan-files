Reader's Letters Abstract

    Beijing Cooperative Headquarters Attaches Importance to People's Letters to Improve Work
    Li Qiufa of the Beijing Cooperative Headquarters writes: In the first half of this year, our headquarters and its affiliated grassroots cooperatives received a total of 896 letters from the people, 2,657 opinions from members, and 20 issues reflected by the people who came to the headquarters in person. These opinions have played a great role in promoting our work improvement. For example, the suburban farmers requested that the cooperatives supply bran in a timely manner as pig feed during the busy farming season, and housewives requested that the cooperatives supply dry firewood and dry coal briquettes in winter, which enabled us to understand the needs of cooperative members and the masses in a timely manner. In addition, the opinions raised by the masses on the poor management of some cooperatives, resulting in serious waste and losses, the poor quality and high prices of individual goods in some cooperatives, and the poor service attitude or careless work of some cooperative salespersons, have also been of great help in promoting our work improvement, educating cadres, eliminating errors, and implementing the responsibility system.
    Because we attach importance to handling the opinions and requests raised by readers, the relationship between the cooperatives and the cooperative members has been greatly strengthened. For example, some grassroots cooperatives have set up "Member Goods Request Registration Books" to supply goods in a timely manner based on the registration. This practice has been supported by the members.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    北京市合作总社重视人民来信改进工作
    北京市合作总社李秋发来信：今年上半年，我们总社及所属基层合作社共收到人民来信八百九十六件，社员意见两千六百五十七条，人民群众亲自来总社反映的问题二十件。这些意见，对推动我们改进工作起了很大作用。如郊区农民要求合作社在农忙季节及时供应麸皮作猪食，家庭主妇要求合作社在冬天供应干劈柴、干煤球等意见，使我们能够及时了解社员群众的需要。又如群众对某些合作社经营不善、造成严重浪费亏损，某些合作社个别货物质量不好、价格太高，以及某些合作社售货员服务态度不好或者工作粗心大意等情况提出的意见，对于推动我们改进工作，教育干部，消灭差错，贯彻责任制也有很大帮助。
    由于我们重视处理读者所提出的意见和要求，合作社和社员群众的联系大大加强了。如某些基层合作社设置了“社员要货登记簿”，根据登记及时供应货物。这种做法，受到了社员的拥护。
