The Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee is urging relevant trade and production units to process orders and sign supply contracts for plumbing hardware in order to help various construction departments strive to complete this year's capital construction plan.

In the past, plumbing hardware was purchased separately by construction units, so some units experienced blind purchasing. This year, the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee adopted the method of "unified planning and supply" to strengthen the leadership of material supply. Since its implementation, due to the prior estimation work in the first half of the year, the relevant trade units organized processing orders, basically meeting the needs of construction units except for individual special materials.

Currently, it is the construction departments' high tide of construction, and more than half of this year's tasks need to be completed in the second half of the year, especially the installation projects of plumbing and electrical, most of which are concentrated in the second half of the year. Therefore, doing a good job in the supply of plumbing hardware will be one of the important factors in completing this year's tasks. Although the construction units submitted their material plans for the second half of the year at the end of June, most of the plans were not accurate enough, so the original plans were revised. The relevant trade companies signed processing order supply contracts with the relevant factories according to the revised plans. However, some materials in production and supply, still cannot fully meet the needs of construction; some materials, although the quantity is enough, but the supply time and specifications are not suitable for needs; and some materials have not been organized for processing orders. The reason for this situation is that some trade companies have not fully realized that insufficient material supply will affect the completion of the state's capital construction plan, and have not deeply understood the needs of construction units. Individual companies even only care about operating materials with simple specifications and easy to purchase and sell, and are unwilling to operate materials with complex specifications and difficult to purchase; on the other hand, some construction units cannot submit material plans in a timely manner, but buy as they use, and the plans they submit are not accurate, so that trade companies cannot supply in a planned manner, which delays the time for processing orders and affects the balance of production and sales. The construction engineering company directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry originally proposed a plan to have seven tons of pig iron pipes, but actually needed one hundred tons, the plan and actual needs differed by more than ten times. The first construction engineering company directly under North China proposed a plan to have 50,000 pieces of radiators, but actually only needed 7,500 pieces.

In order to solve the problems in the supply of plumbing hardware, the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee recently convened a meeting of construction and trade units in the city, requesting the construction departments to quickly revise the material plans according to actual needs, and pay attention to saving or using substitutes for materials that are in short supply; requiring the trade departments to actively find ways to organize production or transfer from other regions for several materials that are in short supply, and should also supply according to the importance and urgency of the project to ensure the completion of the state's capital construction plan.

### 北京市财政经济委员会督促有关部门  做好水暖小五金器材的供应工作

    北京市财政经济委员会督促有关部门
    做好水暖小五金器材的供应工作
    北京市财政经济委员会正督促有关贸易和生产单位进行水暖小五金器材的加工订货及签订供应合同的工作，以帮助各建筑部门争取完成今年的基本建设计划。
    水暖小五金器材过去是由建筑单位各自采购的，因此有些单位曾经发生盲目采购的现象。今年，市财政经济委员会采取“统一筹措，计划供应”的办法，加强了对材料供应工作的领导。自实行以来，在上半年中由于事前进行了估算工作，各有关贸易单位组织了加工订货，除个别特殊材料外，基本上满足了施工单位的需要。
    目前正是建筑部门的施工高潮，今年全年的任务有半数以上需要在下半年完成，特别是水暖电气的安装工程，大部分都集中在下半年进行。因此，做好水暖小五金器材供应工作，将是完成今年任务的重要因素之一。各建筑单位虽然在六月底就提出了下半年的材料计划，但大部分计划不够准确，所以又将原计划作了修改。有关的贸易公司根据修改了的计划，分别和各有关工厂签订了加工订货供应合同。但有些材料在生产和供应上，还不能完全满足施工的需要；有些材料虽然数量够了，但供应的时间和规格又不能适合需要；还有的材料没有组织加工订货。产生这种情况的原因，一方面是有的贸易公司还没有充分认识到材料供应不足将会影响国家基本建设计划的完成，没有深入了解建筑单位的需要情况，个别的公司甚至只顾经营规格简单和容易进货与销售的材料，而不愿经营规格复杂、进货困难的材料；另一方面是有些建筑单位不能及时提出材料计划，而是随用随买，提了计划也很不准确，使贸易公司不能有计划地供应，这样就延缓了加工订货的时间，影响了产销的平衡。中央重工业部直属建设工程公司原来提出的计划是要七吨生铁管，实际上是需要一百吨，计划与实际需要相差十多倍。华北直属第一建筑工程公司提出计划要五万片暖气片，而实际上只要七千五百片就够了。
    市财政经济委员会为了解决水暖小五金器材供应中的问题，最近召集本市各建筑、贸易单位开会，要求各建筑部门根据实际需要迅速修订材料计划，对供应不足的材料应注意节约或使用代用品；要求各贸易部门对几种供应不足的材料积极设法组织生产或由其他地区调入，同时应根据工程的轻重缓急进行供应，以保证国家基本建设计划的完成。
